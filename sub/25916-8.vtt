WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.925
[theme music playing]

00:10.010 --> 00:11.428
[man] <i>Hey!</i>

00:41.124 --> 00:42.417
[exhales]

00:42.500 --> 00:44.085
Remember, Dagmar,

00:44.169 --> 00:47.964
when we used to sneak into church
to smooch on this very spot?

00:48.048 --> 00:50.133
[chuckles] Oh, the fun we had.

00:50.842 --> 00:54.679
[sighs] If only I was caressing
your warm, soft hand

00:54.763 --> 00:56.973
instead of this cold, stone foot. <i>I wish you were here for Beanie.</i>

00:59.350 --> 01:03.313
<i>You know how hard it is being a father</i>
<i>without a mother doing all the work?</i>

01:03.938 --> 01:05.732
<i>Oh, who am I kidding?</i>

01:05.815 --> 01:07.776
<i>I wish you were here for me.</i>

01:07.859 --> 01:11.488
[sniffs] Aw, he's like a coconut.

01:11.571 --> 01:14.866
Hard on the outside, but on the inside...

01:15.492 --> 01:17.410
-coconut.
-[Cloyd] Jerry!

01:17.494 --> 01:20.205
Who said you could watch the Oracle Fire?

01:20.288 --> 01:24.542
[gasps] Zog's leaving the church.
We must track his progress.

01:24.626 --> 01:25.835
Show me the wizard.

01:28.421 --> 01:31.758
Eye of newt, tail of newt,

01:33.009 --> 01:35.804
rest of newt and blood of elf.

01:35.887 --> 01:37.138
Doink.

01:39.641 --> 01:40.475
[splat]

01:41.017 --> 01:41.976
[door opens]

01:42.060 --> 01:44.062
This better be the Elixir of Life.

01:44.145 --> 01:47.148
I wish it were elixir of death,
you fat sack. Oops!

01:47.232 --> 01:49.526
-What?
-Apologies, Your Highness.

01:49.609 --> 01:52.445
I seem to have accidentally invented
a truth serum,

01:52.529 --> 01:55.281
you gravy-swilling blowhard! Oh.

01:55.365 --> 01:58.243
Truth serum?
No king wants to hear the truth.

01:58.326 --> 01:59.869
I want the key to life!

01:59.953 --> 02:03.289
You've had elf blood for weeks
and what do you got to show for it?

02:03.373 --> 02:07.001
Well, I created a shampoo
that can make any animal laugh.

02:07.710 --> 02:09.504
[laughing]

02:09.587 --> 02:11.756
How do I know he didn't used to do that?

02:11.840 --> 02:16.136
Make the Elixir of Life
or I'll throw you in a wizard-proof cage,

02:16.219 --> 02:19.764
which for you is a cardboard box
with a brick on it.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.641
[laughing]

02:22.142 --> 02:24.561
Promise me you won't attend my funeral.

02:37.866 --> 02:41.035
[Elfo] So, I hope our drugged-out kiss
isn't making things awkward.

02:41.119 --> 02:42.203
-[Bean] It's not.
-It's just,

02:42.287 --> 02:45.915
now we're in this weird limbo place
and we don't know what we're doing.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.960
I know exactly what we're doing.
We're shopping for turnips.

02:49.043 --> 02:51.004
-[people cheering]
-Oh, uh, hey, a distraction!

02:51.713 --> 02:53.715
[medieval music playing]

02:56.050 --> 02:58.428
[Elfo] What's going on?
Why's everyone so excited?

02:58.511 --> 03:01.806
Remember how people used to just work,
starve or eat?

03:01.890 --> 03:04.100
Now there's a fourth thing, entertainment.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.895
Entertainment is just a tool
that pacifies the masses

03:06.978 --> 03:09.981
and leads to the decay
and ultimate collapse of civilization.

03:10.565 --> 03:11.691
Let's clap along.

03:12.358 --> 03:14.652
[Elfo] Uh, excuse me, pardon me.

03:14.736 --> 03:16.404
Move your fat ass, please.

03:16.487 --> 03:19.616
Ugh. I really don't like the view
from down here.

03:19.699 --> 03:23.494
I love to sway and bounce to the music.

03:24.579 --> 03:25.580
[Elfo whimpers]

03:32.879 --> 03:34.047
[bones crack]

03:49.604 --> 03:50.855
Miss Moonpence?

03:51.564 --> 03:52.565
[Moonpence] Yes, Minister?

03:52.649 --> 03:54.859
Do I have an audience
with the king this morning?

03:54.943 --> 03:56.569
-[Moonpence] No, Minister.
-Good.

03:56.653 --> 03:59.364
I've got a lot of official matters
to take care of.

04:01.032 --> 04:02.867
I wonder what's for lunch.

04:02.951 --> 04:04.202
[Moonpence] Goat loaf.

04:04.994 --> 04:06.537
With spring vegetables.

04:07.538 --> 04:08.790
And gravy.

04:10.625 --> 04:11.960
They're out of gravy.

04:12.043 --> 04:13.461
[door opens]

04:13.544 --> 04:14.796
Oh, I'm in trouble, Oddie.

04:14.879 --> 04:16.339
I can't crack the Elixir of Life

04:16.422 --> 04:18.925
no matter how much I abracazab
and alakazoo.

04:19.008 --> 04:20.385
I'm a fraud!

04:20.468 --> 04:21.552
I am, aren't I?

04:21.636 --> 04:25.306
As a friend and lover,
there is none truer than you.

04:25.390 --> 04:28.059
These hands... I thought they had magic.

04:28.142 --> 04:30.853
They do, and they will. I just don't know
how to work with this elf blood.

04:33.731 --> 04:35.483
It's like it's made of crazy sauce.

04:35.566 --> 04:38.069
I've tried every spell in the book I have.

04:38.152 --> 04:41.030
Then perhaps you need a new book.

04:47.120 --> 04:51.082
You see, there was another practitioner
of the dark arts here.

04:51.165 --> 04:52.333
The Witch.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.168
This was her lair.

04:54.877 --> 04:57.922
That's gonna need
more than a fresh coat of frosting.

05:03.970 --> 05:04.971
Hmm.

05:07.098 --> 05:09.809
[gasps] The Omnicon! The ancient book of spells
and easy Sunday dinners

05:12.687 --> 05:15.315
of which only two copies
are known to exist!

05:15.398 --> 05:19.819
The other belongs to Collecticus
and is still sealed in its original box.

05:21.070 --> 05:22.071
Hmm.

05:22.613 --> 05:24.699
Hmm? Hmm.

05:24.782 --> 05:27.618
<i>"Elixir Vitae con Arroz."</i>

05:27.702 --> 05:31.122
[both] Elixir of Life with Rice!

05:33.291 --> 05:34.876
[Elfo grunts]

05:34.959 --> 05:36.669
[hay man] At last, the elf.

05:36.753 --> 05:40.423
I've been stalking you,
but you have come to me.

05:40.506 --> 05:44.093
Oh, you're a stranger.
I've heard about you.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.970
Now, where's my candy?

05:46.054 --> 05:48.264
[screams and sneezes]

05:48.348 --> 05:49.557
[hay man] Bless you.

05:51.434 --> 05:53.019
[Elfo] Help, help!

05:53.102 --> 05:54.437
Elfo! Where are you?

05:54.520 --> 05:57.523
[Elfo] In here! Hurry, it's really itchy!

06:01.527 --> 06:02.445
[panting]

06:19.087 --> 06:20.129
[Bean] Ho!

06:20.797 --> 06:22.715
[boots scraping]

06:24.926 --> 06:25.968
[grunts]

06:27.845 --> 06:29.472
-I escaped.
-[grunts]

06:29.555 --> 06:31.391
[fading away] No!

06:33.518 --> 06:35.937
[groans] I'll find you, Elfo. I knew you should've kept him on a leash.

06:42.944 --> 06:45.279
[jester] Mmm, boy,
the new armor these days.

06:45.363 --> 06:47.240
Have you seen it? So bulky.

06:47.323 --> 06:49.659
I prefer to stay safe
the old-fashioned way,

06:49.742 --> 06:51.285
running like a coward.

06:51.369 --> 06:52.703
[Zog sighs]

06:53.413 --> 06:56.040
Your Highness, I have miraculous news.

06:56.124 --> 06:58.126
Great, let me turn this off.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.837
Eh? [laughs]

07:00.920 --> 07:02.213
Oh, no.

07:03.464 --> 07:08.052
Sire, we have found the secret to making
the Elixir of Life using elf's blood.

07:08.136 --> 07:08.970
And?

07:09.053 --> 07:12.056
The blood must be distilled
in a special vial,

07:12.140 --> 07:14.142
known as the Eternity Pendant.

07:14.225 --> 07:16.561
-And?
-We don't have it.

07:17.812 --> 07:20.731
But we do know
of its most recent location.

07:21.774 --> 07:23.609
But we looked, and it's not there.

07:24.652 --> 07:27.655
But we can mount a crusade
to find the vial.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.867
But at least we have the elf.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.702
Elfo has been kidnapped!

07:32.785 --> 07:35.163
Fine, fine, on with the whacking.

07:35.246 --> 07:38.958
Hey! That picture was on the wagon
they took Elfo away in!

07:39.041 --> 07:40.376
Belay the whacking.

07:40.460 --> 07:44.714
Your Highness, whoever kidnapped Elfo
knows about that vial, which means--

07:44.797 --> 07:47.175
They're also after the Elixir of Life.

07:47.258 --> 07:49.510
Find the vial, and we find Elfo.

07:49.594 --> 07:51.929
Send all the knights
on a quest for the vial!

07:52.013 --> 07:53.681
Cancel all other quests.

07:53.764 --> 07:55.933
We'll find the one true god next year.

07:56.517 --> 08:01.481
[gasps] We can't let the Eternity Pendant
fall into the wrong hands.

08:01.564 --> 08:04.484
-Summon our stealthiest assassin.
-Right here, sir.

08:04.567 --> 08:07.236
[gasps] Don't do that.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.489
-[horse snorts]
-[Pendergast] Fellow knights,

08:09.572 --> 08:13.576
my lady, and Mertz's mother,
who insisted on coming.

08:13.659 --> 08:17.079
[Mertz's mother] You won't even know
I'm here. Don't slouch, peanut.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.539
We embark on our quest

08:18.623 --> 08:22.627
to bring immortality to our lord
and ruler, the King of Dreamland.

08:23.211 --> 08:24.587
[knights cheer]

08:25.922 --> 08:27.590
And find Elfo!

08:27.673 --> 08:30.009
[Mertz's mother] Aw, that's sweet.
You miss your friend.

08:30.092 --> 08:32.637
But if you don't find him,
maybe I'll introduce you to my son.

08:32.720 --> 08:35.097
-You look like you're in his league.
-[Bean groans]

08:44.899 --> 08:47.944
The Witch's spellbook is the key
to everything.

08:48.027 --> 08:51.155
We must find her
and ask what she knows about the vial.

08:51.239 --> 08:52.823
Her new place is just ahead.

08:52.907 --> 08:54.367
When their gingerbread house blew up,

08:54.450 --> 08:57.203
she and her sister downsized
to a candy condo.

09:03.167 --> 09:06.504
[Pendergast] All right, men, we've got
ten minutes until our saddles melt.

09:07.338 --> 09:10.049
Would you care for some
lightly cursed cookies?

09:10.132 --> 09:13.177
[clears throat] If we could
get to the point of our visit.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.513
This was yours, was it not, Witch?

09:15.596 --> 09:17.348
Please, call me Gwen.

09:17.431 --> 09:21.352
Actually, it belonged
to my no-good ex-husband, Malfus.

09:21.435 --> 09:24.605
Ooh, I love it when people talk smack
about their exes. Dish, girl!

09:24.689 --> 09:27.900
Malfus was obsessed
with making the Elixir of Life.

09:27.984 --> 09:31.904
And once he found the Eternity Pendant,
things went south.

09:31.988 --> 09:33.823
So where is he now?

09:33.906 --> 09:34.865
He went north.

09:34.949 --> 09:37.159
He took himself far away from society

09:37.243 --> 09:39.829
to live atop the highest mountain
in the land.

09:39.912 --> 09:41.664
The Devil's Snowcone.

09:57.221 --> 10:00.433
"Do you dare enter
the Cave of the Single Trap?"

10:01.017 --> 10:03.019
Which of you brave knights
will enter first?

10:03.603 --> 10:04.854
Probably him.

10:04.937 --> 10:06.689
Very well. They don't call me

10:06.772 --> 10:09.317
Mortimer the Expendable
for nothing. [shrieks]

10:10.651 --> 10:12.403
Now that the single trap
has been triggered,

10:12.486 --> 10:14.572
I'm sure the cave is safe to enter.

10:14.655 --> 10:16.699
Allow me. [grunts]

10:18.075 --> 10:21.162
Okay, now that the two-part single trap
has been triggered,

10:21.245 --> 10:23.039
the cave is even safer to enter.

10:23.122 --> 10:24.081
Turbish? Mertz?

10:24.165 --> 10:25.708
[Mertz's mother]
What if there's a third?

10:25.791 --> 10:27.627
You're not sending my peanut in there.

10:27.710 --> 10:28.919
Mom...

10:29.003 --> 10:32.340
[Mertz's mother] You put on metal clothes,
I'm supposed to stop worrying about you?

10:32.423 --> 10:36.218
[groans] I'd rather die
than listen to this. I'm going in.

11:01.202 --> 11:05.122
[man] I'm hidden in the deepest,
darkest part of the cave.

11:05.206 --> 11:08.125
-You shall never find me!
-[Bean] There you are!

11:08.209 --> 11:09.210
[man groans]

11:09.293 --> 11:11.337
Are you Malfus the Philosopher?

11:11.420 --> 11:12.880
I am.

11:12.963 --> 11:17.343
And who are you, that you passed
through the Single Trap with Two Parts?

11:17.426 --> 11:21.263
I am Sorcerio, Wizard of Wonder.
Your traps are no match for--

11:21.347 --> 11:25.267
Parties of three or more?
Yes, I must do something about that.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.978
Now, look, we seek the Eternity Pendant.

11:28.062 --> 11:31.524
Have you availed yourself of it
and been blessed with immortality?

11:31.607 --> 11:34.151
Immortality is a curse.

11:34.944 --> 11:38.114
When life is endless,
so is everything else.

11:38.197 --> 11:40.825
The monotony, the repetition.

11:40.908 --> 11:43.786
The monotony, the repetition.

11:43.869 --> 11:46.956
The monotony, the repetition.

11:47.039 --> 11:49.333
The monotony... [stutters]

11:49.417 --> 11:50.543
Where was I?

11:50.626 --> 11:53.212
Oh, yes, the repetition.

11:53.295 --> 11:54.672
The monotony.

11:54.755 --> 11:57.675
-Let me tell you a story.
-Please don't.

11:57.758 --> 12:00.845
I once knew a charming and brave maiden.

12:00.928 --> 12:02.555
Her name was Gwen.

12:03.305 --> 12:07.017
And after all that,
we fell for each other, hard.

12:07.101 --> 12:09.937
The type of love
that is forged in adventure

12:10.020 --> 12:12.898
-and sealed in the bedroom.
-[Sorcerio and Bean sigh]

12:12.982 --> 12:14.859
That is so what I want.

12:14.942 --> 12:16.861
Be careful what you wish for.

12:16.944 --> 12:19.655
We pledged our eternal love for each other

12:19.739 --> 12:23.534
and I thought, what if our love
could actually be eternal?

12:23.617 --> 12:26.495
All it took was one drop of elf blood. I used it, but Gwen refused.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.625
She was the smart one. We'd already been married for 90 years

12:33.878 --> 12:38.048
and weren't sure our 17th dog
was going to solve our problems.

12:38.132 --> 12:39.717
It did, for a while.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.303
But then it didn't, so we split.

12:42.386 --> 12:43.637
I came here,

12:43.721 --> 12:46.849
but not before I got rid
of that infernal vial!

12:46.932 --> 12:48.851
[gasps] Got rid of it?

12:48.934 --> 12:52.813
I threw it over the Edge of the World.

12:52.897 --> 12:54.482
There's such a place?

12:54.565 --> 12:57.485
Just up Cherrywood Road.
Take a right at the dance academy.

12:57.568 --> 12:59.570
But it will do you no good
to get that vial. You need elf's blood.

13:01.739 --> 13:04.158
We have an elf.
Or, at least, we had one.

13:04.241 --> 13:05.451
He was kidnapped.

13:05.534 --> 13:08.162
By someone with this symbol
on their wagon.

13:08.245 --> 13:10.456
You say they have your elf?

13:10.539 --> 13:13.667
If they get that vial,
it will be cataclysmic!

13:13.751 --> 13:16.462
Find him, and it, and them!

13:16.545 --> 13:18.964
And maybe on the way, yourselves.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.050
It's all in my book.

13:21.133 --> 13:24.553
It's less a book
and more a letter to my father.

13:24.637 --> 13:25.846
[Sorcerio] Farewell, Malfus.

13:25.930 --> 13:28.724
Let me give you a gift
to help lift your tedium.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.018
What need have I for a horse?

13:31.101 --> 13:33.813
This is no ordinary horse.

13:33.896 --> 13:36.690
-[laughs]
-A laughing horse!

13:36.774 --> 13:41.695
Hooray. The cave will be filled
with the sound of laughter

13:41.779 --> 13:44.031
and the smell of horse.

13:44.114 --> 13:45.449
Now, please, go.

13:45.533 --> 13:48.953
The Eternity Pendant must not fall
into the wrong hands.

13:49.036 --> 13:51.997
Malfus, how do you know
we'll use the vial properly?

13:52.081 --> 13:53.541
You don't know anything about us.

13:53.624 --> 13:56.710
I know all about you, Tiabeanie.

13:56.794 --> 13:58.671
But I didn't tell you my name.

13:58.754 --> 14:01.090
Well, it's a long story, I...

14:01.173 --> 14:03.384
-[Luci] Hee-ya!
-[horse neighs]

14:06.554 --> 14:08.514
[laughing]

14:08.597 --> 14:12.601
The sound of your laughter
brings me such joy.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.478
So I'll eat your head last. [laughs and groans]

14:22.194 --> 14:23.654
[knights shouting indistinctly]

14:28.993 --> 14:32.788
They call it an edge,
but it's really more of a gentle slope!

14:32.872 --> 14:33.873
[echoing]

14:33.956 --> 14:36.500
Well, we're never gonna find
Elfo this way.

14:36.584 --> 14:37.751
Is that all you care about?

14:37.835 --> 14:39.837
I've lost three
of my finest suits of armor.

14:39.920 --> 14:40.880
And their contents.

14:40.963 --> 14:43.090
Aw, here's the world's smallest lute.

14:43.173 --> 14:45.759
I'm gonna find out
what they know in the gift shop.

14:46.677 --> 14:50.931
Say, Darrell, what happens to the stuff
that goes over the edge?

14:51.015 --> 14:53.142
It falls forever, I guess.

14:53.225 --> 14:55.227
Has anyone ever gotten something back?

14:55.311 --> 14:57.479
Well, mostly people throw stuff
they don't want back.

14:57.563 --> 15:00.691
We also sell stuff people don't want.
Do you want some?

15:00.774 --> 15:03.736
For a shilling I can engrave it
with the name of an unloved one.

15:03.819 --> 15:06.363
No, thanks, but I will take this rope.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.282
Would you like it engraved for a shilling?

15:08.365 --> 15:10.826
What part of "no, thanks"
do you not understand?

15:10.910 --> 15:12.536
The "no" part.

15:22.129 --> 15:24.548
[knights straining]

15:27.760 --> 15:28.636
[screams]

15:28.719 --> 15:30.596
-[Mertz grunts]
-[Sorcerio screams]

15:33.641 --> 15:35.267
-What's up?
-Why did you jump?

15:35.351 --> 15:38.270
Eh, Mrs. Mertz looked at me
like she was gonna say something.

15:38.354 --> 15:40.230
[all screaming]

15:44.610 --> 15:46.278
[Bean sighs] Thank you for saving us, sir.

15:46.362 --> 15:49.323
I didn't save you
so much as you fell on me.

15:49.406 --> 15:50.783
Make yourselves at home.

15:50.866 --> 15:53.243
Would anyone care for regurgitated salmon?

15:53.327 --> 15:55.537
No. That's gonna be a hard nope.

15:55.621 --> 15:58.540
No offense, but what the hell's up
with your schnoz?

15:58.624 --> 16:02.920
I'm a griffin.
Half-man, half-bird, half-lion.

16:03.003 --> 16:04.838
The last female of my kind.

16:04.922 --> 16:07.466
-You're a lady?
-Gender is a spectrum.

16:07.549 --> 16:09.635
Why are your people going extinct?

16:09.718 --> 16:14.807
These days, most men prefer to fornicate
with something other than a giant bird.

16:14.890 --> 16:17.726
I don't suppose any of you
would be willing to help a gal out?

16:17.810 --> 16:20.479
Is it cultural appropriation
if I wear a beak?

16:20.562 --> 16:23.774
Dude, keep your cape on.
Look at the stuff in his nest.

16:23.857 --> 16:27.611
[griffin] I decorated it myself.
With objects that fell into it.

16:27.695 --> 16:29.154
Many of them engraved.

16:29.238 --> 16:32.282
This one says "I hate you, Darrell."

16:32.366 --> 16:35.703
Did anything similar to this fall in?

16:35.786 --> 16:38.455
No. But that exact thing fell in.

16:38.539 --> 16:39.623
May we see it?

16:39.707 --> 16:43.961
No. I traded it years ago
to a king with a crown of snakes.

16:44.044 --> 16:45.838
A king? From where?

16:45.921 --> 16:47.881
The Lost City of Cremorrah.

16:47.965 --> 16:49.299
Cremorrah?

16:49.383 --> 16:50.884
[Jo] Of course. Cremorrah.

16:52.594 --> 16:54.013
It's that creepy exorcist!

16:54.096 --> 16:55.431
I have a name, you know.

16:55.514 --> 16:57.099
Big Jo.

16:57.182 --> 16:58.183
Indeed.

16:58.267 --> 17:02.438
Thank you for the information, Birdman.
You've saved me a lot of time.

17:02.521 --> 17:05.858
Unlike other villains,
I shan't be telling you my plan.

17:05.941 --> 17:07.109
Good day.

17:09.570 --> 17:13.824
Oh, and in my mind, I'm not a villain.
I think what I'm doing is good.

17:14.825 --> 17:18.120
He must be the one who took Elfo.
We gotta go after him.

17:18.203 --> 17:20.080
Birdman, activate!

17:20.164 --> 17:21.498
[grunts]

17:22.666 --> 17:24.418
Any other requests?

17:30.174 --> 17:31.925
Help! They tied us up!

17:32.009 --> 17:34.219
Hurry, my mom's gag is coming loose!

17:34.303 --> 17:37.347
Good luck with that. Giddyup!

17:42.895 --> 17:44.188
Faster, Porky!

17:45.147 --> 17:46.774
I have a brilliant idea.

17:46.857 --> 17:49.526
-Birdman, activate!
-Oh, boy.

17:49.610 --> 17:51.487
[grunts]

17:53.405 --> 17:55.115
Damn it! Drop another one!

17:55.199 --> 17:57.826
All right, but I'll need 20 minutes
and a big glass of milk.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.245
Well, you gotta drop something on them.

18:00.329 --> 18:02.456
[screams and grunts]

18:02.539 --> 18:04.875
What the hell was the egg
supposed to do anyway?

18:04.958 --> 18:05.876
Yeah, now what?

18:05.959 --> 18:09.671
We gotta sneak our way to the front.
We'll take 'em by surprise.

18:14.343 --> 18:15.886
Yeah!

18:15.969 --> 18:18.722
How sweet. You missed me. [blows]

18:18.806 --> 18:20.974
What the... [exhales]

18:21.475 --> 18:25.395
We can do this the easy way
or the hard way.

18:25.479 --> 18:27.606
I'm all about the easy way.

18:35.030 --> 18:37.574
[passengers] Whoa! Whoa!

18:40.828 --> 18:43.288
Whoa!

18:45.374 --> 18:48.377
-Where am I?
-[Elfo] In the hold of a cargo ship.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.796
Elfo? Oh, my God, where are you?

18:50.879 --> 18:52.714
[Elfo] In the hold of a cargo ship.

18:52.798 --> 18:55.384
-I meant, I don't see you.
-[Elfo] I'm in a sack.

18:55.467 --> 18:58.887
And there's something huge on top of me.
Feels like a bear!

18:58.971 --> 19:01.223
Help, it's ripping it open!

19:01.306 --> 19:03.433
[gasps] Bean!

19:03.517 --> 19:06.311
Oh, Elfo, I'm so happy to see you!

19:06.395 --> 19:09.439
Look at your sweet face!
I missed you so much!

19:09.523 --> 19:11.358
Oh, I missed you so much!

19:11.441 --> 19:14.528
Porky and Big Jo
have a really toxic relationship.

19:16.697 --> 19:19.867
Behold! The Lost City of Cremorrah!

19:20.659 --> 19:22.578
Eh, I've beheld better.

19:22.661 --> 19:25.539
How are we supposed to find the vial
if we can't even find the city?

19:25.622 --> 19:29.543
Legend has it, the Eternity Pendant
is awakened by proximity to an elf.

19:29.626 --> 19:32.629
As Elfo nears it,
the vial will give off a tone.

19:32.713 --> 19:37.259
You expect me to crawl around this
overheated hellscape until I hear a beep?

19:37.342 --> 19:40.554
No, Mr. Elfo, I expect you to fry.

19:42.723 --> 19:43.932
[grunts] Ow!

19:44.016 --> 19:45.851
You gotta be kidding. [shrieks]

19:46.602 --> 19:50.355
[gasping] That's hot. Mother bitch.

19:53.358 --> 19:55.777
Thanks, Bean. I'm not burning anymore.

19:55.861 --> 19:58.322
Now the only pain is humiliation.

19:58.405 --> 20:01.992
-[Eternity Pendant chimes]
-I think I found something! It may be...

20:04.077 --> 20:05.871
A way in.

20:09.458 --> 20:12.377
-What happened here?
-Maru happened here.

20:12.461 --> 20:13.837
[gasps]

20:13.921 --> 20:16.757
I have no idea what that means.
I'm just really short of breath.

20:16.840 --> 20:21.428
Cremorrah was a kingdom
of unimaginable wealth... of snakes.

20:21.511 --> 20:25.891
Their thriving snake-based economy
was the envy of the known world.

20:25.974 --> 20:29.937
People became so wealthy,
their pockets were bursting with snakes.

20:30.020 --> 20:33.357
The neighboring kingdom of Maru,
with its mouse-based economy,

20:33.440 --> 20:36.526
was both jealous and in constant peril.

20:37.110 --> 20:39.613
Maru decided to attack Cremorrah,

20:39.696 --> 20:42.616
but, with no army,
they were forced to resort to magic.

20:42.699 --> 20:47.204
They made a potion that could vanquish
an entire kingdom without a single sword.

20:49.957 --> 20:52.334
Maru flooded Cremorrah with the potion

20:52.417 --> 20:54.920
and the residents
were instantly turned to stone.

20:55.003 --> 20:56.880
But the king wasn't here.

20:56.964 --> 21:00.717
Clearly, his people had a wild wingding
while he was away.

21:00.801 --> 21:03.136
Can you imagine such disrespect?

21:03.220 --> 21:07.015
[exclaims] I cannot imagine.
Such disrespect.

21:07.099 --> 21:10.936
When the king returned,
he found everyone frozen in place.

21:11.019 --> 21:14.606
That must be why he sought the powers
of the Eternity Pendant.

21:15.732 --> 21:17.734
[thudding]

21:23.615 --> 21:24.533
[Luci] Noice.

21:24.616 --> 21:28.495
He didn't have elf's blood,
so he, too, was turned to stone.

21:28.578 --> 21:30.706
Still, he was the last to possess it.

21:30.789 --> 21:33.333
Find the king, find the vial.

21:33.417 --> 21:35.168
[Eternity Pendant chimes]

21:51.018 --> 21:52.436
[Jo] There he is.

21:52.519 --> 21:56.857
Remember the solemn moment
we first laid eyes on King Doris.

21:56.940 --> 22:00.068
Wow, one day
you're an amazing civilization,

22:00.152 --> 22:02.904
the next you're a creepy spook-house.

22:02.988 --> 22:04.990
[Eternity Pendant chiming]

22:06.533 --> 22:10.495
Forty-five years of necromancing
has led me to this moment.

22:10.579 --> 22:13.874
Porky, quit joking around
and search the king.

22:20.881 --> 22:22.591
You will never get the vial!

22:22.674 --> 22:23.592
[all gasp]

22:23.675 --> 22:25.844
You're not a stone guard guy!

22:25.927 --> 22:26.970
Who are you?

22:27.054 --> 22:30.640
I am an assassin from Maru,
in the service of Emperor Cloyd.

22:30.724 --> 22:32.142
And what is your charge?

22:32.225 --> 22:36.480
To protect the Eternity Pendant!
And to answer all questions!

22:37.064 --> 22:39.900
Let's slip out under cover
of all the clanking.

22:39.983 --> 22:42.194
Bean, wait.
If we come home without the vial,

22:42.277 --> 22:44.988
your dad will pop a blood vessel.
Probably one of yours.

22:45.072 --> 22:48.241
We don't even know where it is.
It's not on the frozen king guy.

22:48.325 --> 22:50.577
[Eternity Pendant chiming]

22:55.791 --> 22:56.792
[muffled] Ah.

22:57.918 --> 23:00.796
Looks like a bunch of dead mice and...

23:01.296 --> 23:02.381
[exclaims]

23:02.464 --> 23:03.965
-[Eternity Pendant chiming]
-Wow.

23:04.049 --> 23:06.009
[gasps and chuckles]

23:10.222 --> 23:12.557
Ha. Nothing to see here.

23:26.905 --> 23:29.116
-Got ya!
-No! Let go!

23:29.199 --> 23:32.619
Ha! Because of you,
I lost a hand in that volcano.

23:32.702 --> 23:34.579
And now you shall lose a foot,

23:34.663 --> 23:37.707
as I take this boot
and all that's within it.

23:37.791 --> 23:40.127
[Bean grunting]

23:40.210 --> 23:42.212
No wonder Porky hates you.

23:42.796 --> 23:44.589
[screams] My shiny new arm!

23:44.673 --> 23:45.924
Go!

23:47.008 --> 23:49.094
[grunts] She's leaving with the vial!

23:50.262 --> 23:52.514
Weren't you told
not to let anyone take it?

23:52.597 --> 23:55.851
Not anyone, just you.
My job is done.

23:55.934 --> 23:58.019
See you in Hell, weirdo.

24:02.357 --> 24:04.484
Let's see how you like getting bottled up.

24:05.777 --> 24:08.697
You'll never be able to fill
this whole room with sand.

24:08.780 --> 24:11.241
Uh, sure we will.
There's a whole desert up here.

24:12.868 --> 24:14.119
[screams]

24:14.202 --> 24:15.370
-[all cheer]
-[Bean] Whoa!

24:16.705 --> 24:18.123
[screaming]

24:20.459 --> 24:21.376
[screaming]

24:22.627 --> 24:23.628
Whoa!

24:34.973 --> 24:38.143
Our plan is even closer to fruition.

24:38.226 --> 24:40.770
To the end of Dreamland.

24:40.854 --> 24:43.690
[both laughing maniacally]

24:46.193 --> 24:50.906
While I question their evil motives,
it is nice to see them happy.

24:58.246 --> 25:00.207
Immortality is folly.

25:00.290 --> 25:05.795
Those who desire it become blind
to what is precious and right before them,

25:05.879 --> 25:07.797
our daily lives.

25:07.881 --> 25:10.342
That we may live each day and say...

25:10.425 --> 25:11.885
[laughing]

25:12.469 --> 25:16.806
You know, I'm profoundly lonely,
but I think you should leave.

25:16.890 --> 25:18.892
[theme music playing]
