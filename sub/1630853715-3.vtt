the one and the only--

00:23.213 --> 00:24.716

00:24.816 --> 00:26.019
Richie Suck!

00:26.119 --> 00:27.822
-(cheering)
-(shouts) Wow!

00:27.923 --> 00:30.194
NADJA:
If you are a vampire,
then you will know

00:30.294 --> 00:31.597
who Richie Suck is.

00:31.697 --> 00:33.300
He is probably the greatest
vampire rap artist

00:33.400 --> 00:34.536
of all time.

00:34.636 --> 00:35.872
He's actually sucked
Richie Suck,

00:35.972 --> 00:37.943
haven't you, Phillip?

into seclusion

00:56.112 --> 00:57.983
to work on
his ultimate masterpiece.

00:58.083 --> 01:00.020
Doing his first live
performance in over a decade

01:00.120 --> 01:01.957
is a very huge deal for him.

01:02.057 --> 01:03.661

a huge deal for us.

just so you know.

01:06.299 --> 01:07.201

02:12.866 --> 02:14.435
and then you will pay her,

02:29.566 --> 02:31.537
Everything is in order,
Mistress Nadja.

02:31.637 --> 02:33.708
The wraiths have topped off

02:33.808 --> 02:34.977
NADJA:
Wonderful.

02:35.077 --> 02:37.081
People think that
a vampire nightclub

02:37.181 --> 02:39.051
is just a 24-hour
live suck-and-fuck fest

02:39.151 --> 02:40.755

02:40.855 --> 02:43.126

02:43.226 --> 02:44.730
NADJA:

02:44.830 --> 02:46.065
What are you doing
just stood there

02:47.669 --> 02:49.973
-Where is your undead fiancée?
-Marwa is at home.

02:50.073 --> 02:52.378
I'm kind of giving her
some space.

02:52.478 --> 02:53.413
Oh.

02:53.514 --> 02:54.583
(groans)

02:55.417 --> 02:58.323
Can you go and stand over there
and just pretend not to listen?

02:58.423 --> 02:59.425
I can do that.

02:59.526 --> 03:01.162
Trouble in paradise
already, is it?

03:01.262 --> 03:04.435
It's just...
Marwa is the perfect woman.

03:04.536 --> 03:06.172
-Right.
-And I've got the djinn

03:06.272 --> 03:08.143
to make her even more perfect.

03:08.243 --> 03:09.780
I mean, you should see
the modifications

03:09.880 --> 03:11.149
we've done to her ass.

03:11.249 --> 03:12.652
-But...
-Ass, butt,

03:12.752 --> 03:15.257
whatever you want to call it.
It is now perfect.

03:15.357 --> 03:17.461
NADJA:
But... the problem is...

03:17.562 --> 03:18.964
Again, the butt
is not the problem.

03:19.065 --> 03:21.637
The problem is
that she is so perfect.

03:21.737 --> 03:24.075
I am just worried that...
(sighs)

03:24.175 --> 03:26.112
I am not perfect enough for her.

03:26.212 --> 03:27.481
It's never too late
to do some improvements

03:27.582 --> 03:28.851
on yourself, so as...

03:28.951 --> 03:31.356
you would be deserving
of her love, huh?

03:31.456 --> 03:32.157
Yes.

03:32.257 --> 03:33.861
I had not thought of that.

03:33.961 --> 03:36.399
Thank you. I will try this.

03:36.500 --> 03:38.904
-And nice hats.
-Thank you.

03:39.004 --> 03:41.008

Don't mind if I do?

-NANJA: Ooh, so exciting, ha!

03:44.348 --> 03:46.553

-Yes?

03:46.653 --> 03:49.760
I am afraid Richie Suck
has cancelled.

03:49.860 --> 03:51.229
What?

03:52.231 --> 03:55.203
-Motherfucker!

03:55.303 --> 03:57.041

-Oh, shit.

Richie Suck lives
in a smokestack?

04:02.886 --> 04:04.288
NADJA:
Okay, when we get inside,

04:04.388 --> 04:07.061
I'm going to go in and scare him
and be the bad cop,

04:07.161 --> 04:09.231
and you're going to go to him
and be very friendly.

04:09.331 --> 04:11.302
-The good cop, you know?
-I ain't a cop.

04:11.402 --> 04:12.505
It's a tactic.

04:12.605 --> 04:15.511
Look, I ain't a cop
or a narc or a snitch.

04:15.611 --> 04:18.416
It is pretend.
Keep your perm on.

04:18.517 --> 04:19.553
Open up!

Can I help you?

04:21.657 --> 04:24.796

Take us to him at once.

04:24.896 --> 04:26.800
My master is not
to be disturbed.

04:26.900 --> 04:27.936
He's resting right now.

04:28.036 --> 04:30.006
Like hell he is.

04:30.107 --> 04:31.710
He's supposed to be
performing tonight.

04:31.810 --> 04:33.012
I'm not inviting you in.

04:33.113 --> 04:34.583
RICHIE:
Hey, Tom. Just let them in, Tom.

04:34.683 --> 04:36.152
Oh, come on.
(exhales)

04:36.252 --> 04:38.089

-Chillin'?
-Chilling?

04:45.070 --> 04:47.007
TOM:
You need to leave.

04:47.107 --> 04:49.145
My master is way
too tired for this.

04:49.245 --> 04:50.447
-Good night.
-(Nadja gasps)

04:50.548 --> 04:51.984
Richie Suck, who the hell
is this jackzass?

04:52.084 --> 04:55.056
-This is my familiar, Tom.
-Doctor Tom.

04:55.157 --> 04:56.927
And you let him speak
to you like this?

04:57.027 --> 04:58.531
I take care of my master.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.868
He's been traumatized
by the music business.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.872
Okay, okay. Begone, familiar.

05:02.972 --> 05:04.175
I'm not speaking to you.

05:04.275 --> 05:06.112
This is a vampires-only
discussion.

05:06.212 --> 05:07.147
Right, Richie?

05:07.247 --> 05:08.818
Tom protects me from myself,

05:08.918 --> 05:10.420
so you need to be respectful.

05:10.521 --> 05:12.926
-Of a familiar?
-I have a name.

05:13.026 --> 05:14.328
Shut up, familiar Tom.

05:14.428 --> 05:16.800
-It's "Doctor Tom."
-NADJA: Oh. A doctor?

05:16.900 --> 05:18.203
Diagnose this.

05:18.303 --> 05:20.708
It's a middle finger in my face.

05:22.311 --> 05:24.649
He's a good doctor.

05:24.749 --> 05:25.985
Hey, guys, what's up?

05:26.085 --> 05:27.387
Before we dive in,
be sure to smash

05:27.488 --> 05:29.024

GUILLERMO:
I mean, last week

05:39.211 --> 05:40.515
he was in diapers, and this week

05:40.615 --> 05:42.484
he looks like a six,
seven-year-old, maybe?

05:42.585 --> 05:44.255
I mean, every time I buy him
a new pair of shoes,

05:44.355 --> 05:45.992
he outgrows them between
breakfast and lunch.

05:46.092 --> 05:47.595
But guess what? You can mod it

05:47.695 --> 05:50.333
so it looks just like
the set of South Pacific.

05:50.433 --> 05:52.237
-I turn the set...
-Oh, no. Gizmo.

05:52.337 --> 05:55.645
There you are. What the fuck
have you got that boy doing?

05:55.745 --> 05:57.649
What? I didn't do anything.
He does that all on his own.

05:57.749 --> 05:59.553
-LASZLO: I told you
I wanted him to grow up...
-See?

05:59.653 --> 06:01.255
...to be an interesting
son of a bitch,

06:01.355 --> 06:02.725

06:02.826 --> 06:04.863
So how come he's still
doing this boring shit?

06:04.963 --> 06:06.733
To him, this isn't boring.
He's just like any other kid

06:06.834 --> 06:10.808

and Nerf guns and musi...

06:10.908 --> 06:13.179

06:19.826 --> 06:21.128
(whispering):
Okay.

06:21.229 --> 06:24.034
He really loves
musical theater.

06:24.836 --> 06:26.339
Oh, no.

06:26.439 --> 06:28.476
What hath the dark lord wrought?

06:28.577 --> 06:29.913
Stop, okay?
Maybe it's good for him.

06:30.013 --> 06:31.583
Maybe it's good for him.
It's a good art,

06:31.683 --> 06:34.054
no different than
literature or the cinema...

06:34.154 --> 06:35.892
It is not like any other art.

06:35.992 --> 06:38.998
Musical theater is the lowest
of all entertainments.

06:39.098 --> 06:40.501
It's a gutter pantomime,

06:40.601 --> 06:42.939

with painted faces,

06:43.039 --> 06:44.609

07:59.224 --> 08:00.828
(laughs)
See?

08:00.928 --> 08:02.665
-You're like a big Slinky.
-All right.

08:02.765 --> 08:06.172
Then you take this glass cutter
and cut a hole in here.

08:06.272 --> 08:08.009
-But, Lazzo, guess what?
-What?

08:08.109 --> 08:11.048
I used knolling when I got
that Stranger Things Lego set.

08:11.148 --> 08:14.188
I used it to make the library
in The Music Man, which is...

08:14.288 --> 08:15.925
Boy, we don't have time
for this right now.

08:16.025 --> 08:18.162
-Let's get on.
-Okay, but, Lazzo, guess what?

08:18.262 --> 08:19.599
You don't have to keep saying
"Guess what?"

08:19.699 --> 08:21.570
to preface every remark
that you make.

08:21.670 --> 08:24.208
Just say whatever the fuck
it is that you want to say.

08:24.308 --> 08:27.247
Uh, I'm sorry.

08:28.049 --> 08:29.418
No, look, I'm...

08:29.519 --> 08:31.088
I'm sorry. What is it
that you wanted to say?

08:31.188 --> 08:34.729
That set broke, so I shoved
all the pieces under the bed.

08:34.829 --> 08:38.469
Okay. Fair enough. Now,
can we continue with the crime?

08:38.570 --> 08:40.240
Yeah, sure. Do you think
that Marian...

08:40.340 --> 08:42.779
-(alarm blaring)
-What the fuck are you doing?
I just said...

08:42.879 --> 08:44.849
-Shut up.
-...because it kind of
rhymes with "librarian,"

08:44.949 --> 08:46.052
or do you think it was so...

08:46.152 --> 08:48.289
NANDOR:
I decided

08:48.389 --> 08:50.995
that to improve
my relationship with my fiancée

08:51.095 --> 08:53.901
I need to do
some work on myself.

08:54.001 --> 08:55.136
Hmm. It couldn't hurt.

08:55.236 --> 08:57.675
Little things like being present

08:57.775 --> 09:00.881
-or being a good listener.
-Don't be so stupid, Guillermo.

09:01.583 --> 09:04.889
I wish to have
the world's biggest penis.

09:04.989 --> 09:06.693
I see.

09:06.793 --> 09:07.929
Hmm.

09:08.029 --> 09:09.164
Of course. Your wish is...

09:09.264 --> 09:10.601
Oh, actually, can I just call

09:10.701 --> 09:12.705
a quick time-out?
Can I have a minute with Nandor?

09:12.805 --> 09:15.243
If you'd be so kind
as to give us a moment, Djinn.

09:15.343 --> 09:16.580
Is there a reason
why you have delayed

09:16.680 --> 09:18.383
the bestowal upon me
a giant dick?

09:18.483 --> 09:19.886
You need to be really
careful here, okay?

09:19.986 --> 09:22.190
'Cause these djinns,
they like to be tricky.

09:22.290 --> 09:24.061
Yes, I have heard this.

09:24.161 --> 09:26.465
Yeah, and if you're not precise
and perfect with your wish,

09:26.566 --> 09:28.269
it can come back
to bite you in the ass.

09:28.369 --> 09:30.140
Are you saying
he's gonna give me a penis

09:30.240 --> 09:31.910
that's gonna bite me
in my own ass?

09:32.010 --> 09:35.250
What? No. But may-maybe. Yes.
To teach you a lesson.

09:35.350 --> 09:36.753
Make sure that it's where
it's supposed to be,

09:36.853 --> 09:38.356
and not like a random spot
like your forehead.

09:38.456 --> 09:39.692
NANDOR:
I get what you're saying.

09:39.793 --> 09:41.963
This reminds me of
the tale of the man

09:42.064 --> 09:44.034
who wished to be
the richest man in the world,

09:44.134 --> 09:47.675
but was then crushed
under a mountain of gold coins.

09:47.775 --> 09:49.612
Exactly. Irony.

09:49.712 --> 09:52.852
Not iron. Gold. Gold coins.
Try to keep up.

09:52.952 --> 09:55.056
-All right.
-Okay. I'm going to ask

09:55.156 --> 09:56.325
for the world's biggest penis,

09:56.425 --> 09:58.931
but not so big
that it crushes me.

09:59.031 --> 10:00.200
Good.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.872
And that it replaces
my current penis,

10:02.972 --> 10:05.210
not an additional one.

10:05.310 --> 10:06.847
Or... extra penis

10:06.947 --> 10:09.451
attached to the end
of the one I have already.

10:09.552 --> 10:10.988
We should really be
writing this down.

10:11.088 --> 10:12.759
NADJA:
Don't worry so much
about the show.

10:12.859 --> 10:15.831
You can just do the hits
and let us do the rest.

10:15.931 --> 10:18.504
-And...
-Oh. ♪♪ Do-do-do-do-do. ♪♪

10:18.604 --> 10:21.342
You can have as much blood
as you like.

10:21.442 --> 10:23.212
-Virgin. Huh? (laughs)
-No.

10:23.312 --> 10:24.682
Just a little sippy sip?

10:24.783 --> 10:27.287
You're not hungry, Master.
That's in your mind.

10:27.387 --> 10:28.791
-Please.
-No.

10:28.891 --> 10:31.028
-Just a little sip.
-It's not feeding time.

10:31.128 --> 10:33.366
-Look...
-(Nadja sighs)

10:33.466 --> 10:34.736
I'm sorry.
(kisses)

10:34.836 --> 10:37.107
-Ew.
-I'm sorry. I love you, Master.

10:37.207 --> 10:38.610
I'm just here to protect you.

10:38.710 --> 10:40.881
Obviously, Richie is being
very much manipulated

10:40.981 --> 10:41.883
by his familiar, Tom.

10:41.983 --> 10:43.319
You don't want this.

10:43.419 --> 10:44.488
NADJA:
It is something that happens.

10:44.589 --> 10:45.758
Yeah, not so much with vampires,

10:45.858 --> 10:48.095
but all the time
in the music business.

10:48.196 --> 10:49.732
So we both thank you very much.

10:49.833 --> 10:51.435
-I kind of want it, though.
-And we're gonna give it...

10:51.536 --> 10:52.972
-We're gonna give it back.
-Sippy, sippy.

10:53.072 --> 10:54.408
-If you can help me...
-Just a little corner, man.

10:54.509 --> 10:56.111
TOM:
You don't want it. No blood.

10:56.212 --> 10:58.650
But we'd like twice the money.

10:58.750 --> 11:01.255
And we're only doing
new material.

11:01.355 --> 11:02.257
-(hisses)
-TOM: Come on.

11:02.357 --> 11:03.961
It's Richie Suck.

11:04.061 --> 11:06.065
Featuring DJ Tom Schmidt.

11:06.165 --> 11:07.869
I thought you were Doctor Tom.

11:07.969 --> 11:10.240
I'm Doctor Tom, the DJ.

11:10.340 --> 11:12.277
Okay. Fine. It is settled.

11:12.377 --> 11:14.348
You will be there, okay?
In 30 minutes.

11:14.448 --> 11:17.254
I also happen to manage
a small jazz trio.

11:17.354 --> 11:20.260
It'd be great as an opening act.
They're called the Jazzmen 3.

11:20.360 --> 11:21.696
They wail.

11:21.796 --> 11:23.132
GUIDE:
Obviously,

11:23.232 --> 11:24.468
we've got to kill this Tom guy.

11:24.569 --> 11:26.305
Yes, also very standard

11:26.405 --> 11:27.975
music business protocol,
but... (laughs)

11:28.075 --> 11:30.514
Please, can we put a pin in that
until after the show?

11:30.614 --> 11:31.850
-(both laughing)
-Of course.

11:37.093 --> 11:38.396
(siren wailing)

11:38.497 --> 11:40.400
It would appear
the boy has no interest

11:40.501 --> 11:41.803
in larceny or vandalism.

11:41.903 --> 11:43.674
And obviously,
he's too young for whoring.

11:43.774 --> 11:46.412
So to keep this excursion from
being a total waste of time,

11:46.513 --> 11:48.382
I threw him in this dumpster,

11:48.482 --> 11:50.153
and told him
he wasn't allowed out

11:50.253 --> 11:51.923
until he'd killed six rats.

11:52.023 --> 11:53.426
Hey, Lazzo, guess what?

11:53.527 --> 11:54.729
-What?
-Some dumb idiot

11:54.829 --> 11:56.465
threw out all these Playbills.

11:56.566 --> 11:58.035
This one's from Miss Saigon.

11:58.135 --> 12:01.108
Did you know they used
a real helicopter on stage?

12:01.208 --> 12:02.745
But I don't think it could fly.

12:02.845 --> 12:04.916
I think they made it look
that way with ropes...

12:05.016 --> 12:06.820
-LASZLO: Shut up.
-...or what have you.

12:06.920 --> 12:07.755
Unbelievable.

12:07.855 --> 12:09.926
So we are clear on placement?

12:10.026 --> 12:13.500
Yes, yes. It should be in the
usual place between the legs.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.704
Yes, and not
in a separate container

12:15.804 --> 12:18.209
such as a jar or a briefcase.

12:18.309 --> 12:19.879
And not on my chin.

12:21.081 --> 12:23.954
"Not on chin."

12:24.054 --> 12:25.524
Fine. So stipulated.

12:25.624 --> 12:27.460
DJINN:
Well, you know,
I'm used to the questions

12:27.562 --> 12:29.331
about the penis enlargement

12:29.431 --> 12:30.901
because people want
to get it right.

12:31.001 --> 12:34.509
But, uh, I have to say,
I've never dealt with two people

12:34.609 --> 12:36.312
that are this detail-oriented.

12:36.412 --> 12:38.482
NANDOR:
As far as size goes,

12:38.584 --> 12:40.988
it should not be so big
that it crushes me.

12:41.088 --> 12:42.592
What about a mouse?

12:42.692 --> 12:44.596
For a penis? I don't think so,

12:44.696 --> 12:45.965
Djinn, you little trickster.

12:46.065 --> 12:47.635
No, no, I think he means
should the new member be

12:47.735 --> 12:49.639
big enough that it could
crush a mouse?

12:49.739 --> 12:51.375
That is actually what I meant.

12:51.475 --> 12:52.678
Hmm.

12:52.778 --> 12:55.316
A penis so big
it could crush a mouse...

12:55.416 --> 12:58.122
-Yes, don't mind if I do.
-DJINN: Okay.

12:58.222 --> 13:00.093
Well, I think we're all squared.

13:00.193 --> 13:01.462
Wait up. One minute.

13:01.563 --> 13:03.266
One second. My client...
(continues indistinctly)

13:03.366 --> 13:06.071
DJINN:
What they are doing,
it's correct, but, um...

13:06.171 --> 13:08.442
it's annoying.

13:08.543 --> 13:11.583
(indistinct shouting)

13:11.683 --> 13:13.987
(piano rehearsing)

13:14.087 --> 13:15.524
Jazz. Ugh.

13:15.624 --> 13:18.931
(claps once)
Richie Suck, looking good.

13:19.031 --> 13:22.437
-Welcome.
-Doctor Tom likes them better.

13:22.538 --> 13:23.840
Will you please go distract

13:23.941 --> 13:25.778
that stupid doctor familiar
for a minute?

13:25.878 --> 13:29.217
Excuse me? Jazz.
What is jazz?

13:29.318 --> 13:30.654
Richie, baby.

13:30.754 --> 13:32.725
Who is the vampire,
and who is the familiar?

13:32.825 --> 13:34.328
-Doctor Tom says...
-(spits)

13:34.428 --> 13:36.666
Doctor Tom is a familiar.
It doesn't matter what he says.

13:36.766 --> 13:40.239
You have let a human man
transform you from a wild,

13:40.340 --> 13:42.611
horny, rampaging artist

13:42.712 --> 13:45.551
into a little pussy-bitch
who "collaborates"?

13:45.651 --> 13:48.322

14:32.110 --> 14:34.014

about that one?

14:48.275 --> 14:49.746
Why do you ask?

14:49.846 --> 14:52.016
Ninety percent of my business
is penis enlargements.

14:52.117 --> 14:53.687
-GUILLERMO: That much? Really?
-Oh, yeah.

14:53.787 --> 14:57.027
And most clients don't mind
buying new clothes

14:57.127 --> 14:58.429
to feature the updated package.

14:58.530 --> 14:59.932
Hmm.

-NANDOR: Fine. Strike it out.
-DJINN: Very well.

15:02.671 --> 15:04.007
It has been struck.

15:04.107 --> 15:05.443
-MARWA: Darling?
-(shushing)

15:05.544 --> 15:07.414
I'm not doing anything!

15:07.515 --> 15:09.017
Just business stuff.

15:09.117 --> 15:12.658
Okay, I hate to interrupt
your business,

15:12.758 --> 15:15.564
but I know you wish to see
Richie Suck at the club.

15:15.664 --> 15:17.000
-Yes.
-MARWA: Yes.

15:17.100 --> 15:18.837
-Almost done, my morning star.
-MARWA: Okay.

15:18.937 --> 15:20.541
-(whispering): I see you soon.
-DJINN: Richie Suck,

15:20.641 --> 15:22.444
-the rap artist?
-Mm-hmm.

15:22.545 --> 15:25.249
Oh, my cousin granted his wish
to get five mics in The Source.

15:25.349 --> 15:26.886
-Can we wrap this up, please?
-DJINN: Okay.

15:26.986 --> 15:28.957
You guys said you wanted
to circle back

15:29.057 --> 15:30.961
to some concerns
about the balls?

15:31.061 --> 15:33.633
-Yes.
-Yes, let's talk balls.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.238
Why are you sad, Lazzo?

15:36.338 --> 15:39.111
I'm not sad, my boy.
I'm just reflective.

15:39.211 --> 15:41.516
When I was your age,
I loved only two things:

15:41.616 --> 15:43.285
my nanny and my piano.

15:43.385 --> 15:45.056
And my father took them both.

15:45.156 --> 15:46.793
Then he sent me off
to boarding school

15:46.893 --> 15:48.497
-to give me polish.
-Okay.

15:48.597 --> 15:49.832
It wasn't such a waste of time.

15:49.932 --> 15:51.201
I learned how to cheat at cards,

15:51.301 --> 15:52.905
hit the other fellow
before he hit me.

15:53.005 --> 15:55.644
I also learned
not to trust my father

15:55.744 --> 15:57.615
or anyone else, for that matter.

15:57.715 --> 15:59.451
And that took centuries
with my Nadja

15:59.552 --> 16:00.954
-to unravel.
-Okay.

16:01.054 --> 16:05.764
What I'm trying to say is...
I think Gizmo was right.

16:05.864 --> 16:08.970
I think you're going to be
incredibly boring.

16:09.070 --> 16:12.578
The type of chap who goes to see
revival of Auntie Mame

16:12.678 --> 16:13.914
and writes about it
in his diary.

16:14.014 --> 16:15.517
But I don't hold that
against you.

16:15.617 --> 16:17.153
You're a better man than I am.

16:18.322 --> 16:20.928
You were raised to be
charming, not sincere.

16:21.028 --> 16:22.598
Really? Well, that's nicely put.

16:22.698 --> 16:24.134
You're full of surprises.

16:24.234 --> 16:26.405
That's from Into the Woods
by Stephen Sondheim.

16:26.506 --> 16:27.808
-Right.
-I was thinking about it

16:27.908 --> 16:30.547
because I want to turn
my Ewok Village Lego set

16:30.647 --> 16:32.116
into the Giant's tree...

16:32.217 --> 16:34.221
Do you? Really?
Now, why don't we fuck that off

16:34.321 --> 16:36.559
-and go and see Richie Suck.
-Okay.

16:36.659 --> 16:37.795
♪♪ ♪♪

16:37.895 --> 16:40.299
Okay, balls in proportion...

16:40.399 --> 16:42.237
Note the changes...

16:43.205 --> 16:45.811
Very well, Master, your wish...

16:45.911 --> 16:48.115
Wait. You can't give him
the world's largest penis

16:48.215 --> 16:49.852
by making everyone
else's smaller.

16:49.952 --> 16:53.058
Oh, very good catch, Guillermo.

16:53.159 --> 16:54.929
(sputters) Shit.

16:55.029 --> 16:56.098
I mean, well done, familiar.

16:56.198 --> 16:58.169
I was moments away from giving

16:58.269 --> 17:01.776
every man in the world
but Nandor a micro wang.

17:01.876 --> 17:03.680
NANDOR:
Why would you do
such a thing?

17:03.780 --> 17:05.116
It's just part
of the job, I guess.

17:05.216 --> 17:08.890
I teach lessons about
greed, desires, etcetera,

17:08.990 --> 17:11.796
by fucking with the wishes
of my so-called masters.

17:11.896 --> 17:13.934
But you two have bested me.

17:14.034 --> 17:17.373
Your familiar has a very shrewd
and incisive mind

17:17.473 --> 17:20.012
-when it comes to
the penis stuff.
-Thank you.

17:20.112 --> 17:22.551
Or you could've just said
"thank you" to me.

17:22.651 --> 17:24.254
(sighs)
Always so needy.

17:24.354 --> 17:27.293
Thank you, Guillermo,
I appreciate all your help.

17:27.393 --> 17:30.299
And every time
I use my new big dick,

17:30.399 --> 17:32.838
I will think of you
and all you've done for me.

17:32.938 --> 17:34.174
Ah, this is your wish?

17:34.274 --> 17:36.546
-This is my wish.
-This is his wish.

17:36.646 --> 17:38.717
Wish granted!

17:41.522 --> 17:42.725
Excuse me for a moment.

17:42.825 --> 17:43.827
-GUILLERMO: Yes.
-DJINN: Yeah, go ahead.

17:43.927 --> 17:46.666
Would you care for some Yoo-hoo?

17:46.766 --> 17:47.801
No, thank you.

17:47.902 --> 17:49.772
(creaking)

17:49.872 --> 17:51.141
NANDOR:
Oh, wow.

17:51.241 --> 17:52.912
That'll do, pig.

17:53.012 --> 17:55.316
Guillermo, come check out
the size of this unit.

17:55.416 --> 17:56.853
(chuckling):
I'm good.

17:56.953 --> 17:59.391
It's only about 20 percent
bigger than what you had.

17:59.492 --> 18:01.061
I'll be damned.

18:01.161 --> 18:03.098
DJINN:
I was surprised
you wanted more, but, uh...

18:03.198 --> 18:05.369
Yeah, it turned out beautifully
if I do say so myself.

18:05.469 --> 18:07.373
Guillermo, are you sure
you don't want a little peek?

18:07.473 --> 18:09.812
No, I have to get down
to the club.

18:09.912 --> 18:11.883
Oh, okay. Please tell Marwa

18:11.983 --> 18:14.387
that I wish to see her
in the bedroom.

18:14.487 --> 18:15.423
Okay.

18:15.524 --> 18:17.528
-Great work.
-Thanks.

18:17.628 --> 18:19.030
-Yes.
-Yeah.

18:24.307 --> 18:25.944

-(indistinct chattering)

18:26.044 --> 18:28.382

18:32.357 --> 18:36.298

18:36.398 --> 18:37.501
Richie Suck.

18:37.601 --> 18:40.072
-Richie Suck. Richie Suck.
-All right. Hi.

18:40.172 --> 18:41.709
-Sorry, guys.
-Richie Suck.

18:41.809 --> 18:43.212
-All right, hold it down.
-Richie Suck.

18:43.312 --> 18:45.416
Be patient. You look beau...
You don't know jazz

18:45.517 --> 18:47.220
-if you haven't heard it yet,
right?
-Richie Suck.

18:47.320 --> 18:51.128
Hey, how's the, uh...
how's the home?

18:51.228 --> 18:52.330
Fine.

18:52.430 --> 18:53.833
It's perfectly normal.

18:53.934 --> 18:55.637
Happens to every guys.

18:55.737 --> 18:57.407
-Can you sh...?
-We are still
getting reacquainted.

18:57.508 --> 18:58.777
Don't say it here.

18:58.877 --> 19:00.279
-Is everything okay?
-No.

19:00.379 --> 19:02.016
The djinn tricked me
into saying that every time

19:02.116 --> 19:04.387
I used my new big dick,
I will think of you.

19:04.487 --> 19:06.425
-Richie Suck. Richie Suck.
-He got us.

19:06.526 --> 19:07.661
He did.

19:07.761 --> 19:10.634
-Eesh.
-All right. It's not eesh.

19:10.734 --> 19:12.303

19:12.403 --> 19:14.341
-(mixer scratching)
-(crowd whooping)

19:14.441 --> 19:16.044
Is everybody ready
to have a good time,

19:16.144 --> 19:17.313
maybe slightly unpredictable

19:17.413 --> 19:19.150
because it's live,
but still good?

19:19.250 --> 19:20.887
-(cheering)
-(mixer scratching)

19:20.988 --> 19:22.190
(whooping)

19:22.290 --> 19:24.862
Well, then, let's welcome
a true artist

19:24.962 --> 19:27.100
who doesn't give two wet shits
what you think.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.505
Let's get loud for Richie Suck!

19:29.605 --> 19:32.276

Thank you all for coming out.

19:49.812 --> 19:53.419
I've been away for a while,
and it's been a journey.

19:53.520 --> 19:56.659
Uh, so before I start the show,
I want to bring out a man

19:56.759 --> 19:58.663
who's been a really
important part of that.

19:58.763 --> 20:01.703
My familiar, Dr. Tom Schmidt.

20:01.803 --> 20:04.207
GUILLERMO:
(whoops) Familiars!

20:04.307 --> 20:05.811
Thank you, Richie.
First of all...

20:05.911 --> 20:07.948
So me and Tom decided that
I need to be more authentic,

20:08.048 --> 20:10.152
so we collaborated
on a bunch of new songs

20:10.252 --> 20:13.793
for me to do with
the Jazzmen 3 over here.

20:13.893 --> 20:15.229
(booing)

20:15.329 --> 20:16.866
RICHIE:
But guess what?

20:16.966 --> 20:18.570
I'm not going to do them!

20:18.670 --> 20:21.542
-(cheering)
-NADJA: The right decision.

20:21.642 --> 20:23.379
-Master, listen.
-No, man.

20:23.479 --> 20:25.817
I'm done listening to you.
Forever!

20:25.917 --> 20:27.286
No, Master, no! Ahh!

20:27.387 --> 20:28.890
-(hissing)
-RICHIE: Eat that bitch.

20:28.990 --> 20:30.292
Eat that bitch.

20:30.393 --> 20:33.733
Eat bitch. Eat that bitch.
Eat that bitch.

20:33.833 --> 20:34.835
Eat the bitch!

20:34.935 --> 20:36.271
RICHIE:
Now, now, now,

20:36.371 --> 20:38.242
how many of you want
to hear me do my thing?

20:38.342 --> 20:40.914
Who want to hear me do
my truth?

20:41.014 --> 20:42.350
-(cheering)
-NADJA: Yes, please, Richie.

20:42.450 --> 20:44.454
Who wants to hear
some new shit from Richie Suck

20:44.555 --> 20:46.224
that they ain't
never heard before?

20:46.324 --> 20:49.097
-(whooping)
-Go, Richie!

20:49.197 --> 20:51.636
Who wants to hear me do
some observational comedy?

20:51.736 --> 20:53.973
NADJA:
What the fuck?

20:55.544 --> 20:58.248
Like, have you ever been
flying around as a bat...

20:58.348 --> 21:00.119
(chuckles) ...and you get
hit by a drone

21:00.219 --> 21:03.560
and you be like, "Damn,
the robots coming for us?"

21:03.660 --> 21:05.296

21:07.668 --> 21:09.070
RICHIE: You know what...
what is really cool

21:09.170 --> 21:10.372
about being a vampire, though?

21:10.473 --> 21:12.076
You ain't never
got to do no dishes.

21:12.176 --> 21:13.412
-VAMPIRE: Bring back the jazz.
-(hissing)

21:13.513 --> 21:15.216
Never, no dishes.
It's all skin and bone.

21:15.316 --> 21:16.853
-You know?
-(hissing, complaining)

21:16.953 --> 21:18.055
But seriously, though,
grandmamas
