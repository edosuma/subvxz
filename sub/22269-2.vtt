00:26.777 --> 00:28.820
Where is Panto Trost?

00:28.821 --> 00:31.865
Dead, mother.

00:31.866 --> 00:35.118
We chased him to the
edge of the north wood,

00:35.119 --> 00:37.788
and, uh, I dueled him on a cliff.

00:38.914 --> 00:40.457
He stumbled on a rock

00:40.458 --> 00:45.086
and... fell 500 feet

00:45.087 --> 00:49.257
and landed... on a rock,

00:49.258 --> 00:50.634
and his head exploded.

00:52.386 --> 00:57.682
You dueled the greatest
swordsman in Wendimoor,

00:57.683 --> 01:00.185
and he fell on some rocks...

01:00.186 --> 01:02.604
and landed on some rocks...

01:02.605 --> 01:04.899
and his head exploded.

01:06.233 --> 01:08.777
The Trosts have spited our family
for generations.

01:08.778 --> 01:11.404
They think this land is sacred,

01:11.405 --> 01:13.032
and our mining on it a sacrilege...

01:14.366 --> 01:16.242
and now they have killed Farson.

01:16.243 --> 01:18.995
We don't know that
Farson is dead, Mother.

01:18.996 --> 01:19.913
He's merely missing. We could find...

01:19.914 --> 01:21.664
So you admit...

01:21.665 --> 01:23.583
you were afraid to fight Panto Trost?

01:23.584 --> 01:25.044
He lies.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.798
Panto Trost not be dead.

01:29.799 --> 01:33.885
Silas insisted on facing him man to man.

01:35.554 --> 01:36.387
Your son is shit with sword.

01:36.388 --> 01:38.848
You know that, Frija.

01:38.849 --> 01:42.811
I barely got there in time to save him,
and Panto...

01:44.146 --> 01:46.731
slipped away from me.

01:46.732 --> 01:51.111
I... am not as fast
as I was in my glory day.

01:51.112 --> 01:54.240
Silas was ashamed to tell you he lost.

01:55.157 --> 01:56.367
Well, then...

01:59.203 --> 02:04.165
one of you is a loser,
and the other one, an antique.

02:04.166 --> 02:05.834
A lesson needs to be taught,

02:05.835 --> 02:07.836
and apparently, my eldest son

02:07.837 --> 02:09.462
isn't fit to teach it.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.089
Burn down the entire Trost farmlands.

02:11.090 --> 02:12.215
No, no!

02:12.216 --> 02:14.259
You'll simply be doing
The Mage's bidding for him.

02:14.260 --> 02:17.679
He wishes to destroy us,
to destroy everything!

02:17.680 --> 02:19.597
The Kellum Army approaches
our valley of Inglenook.

02:19.598 --> 02:22.183
We must unite with the Trosts.

02:22.184 --> 02:23.852
There's still time
to fulfill the prophecy.

02:23.853 --> 02:25.979
The prophecy...

02:25.980 --> 02:28.107
isn't real, child.

02:30.151 --> 02:32.652
There is no such thing

02:32.653 --> 02:36.406
as "Dirk Gently."

03:04.518 --> 03:06.061
Don't touch it.

03:06.729 --> 03:08.855
How do you think it even got up there?

03:08.856 --> 03:10.023
Tornado, maybe?

03:10.024 --> 03:11.733
It's got to be something weirder than that...

03:11.734 --> 03:12.609
aliens or something.

03:12.610 --> 03:14.444
Let's not jump to that.

03:14.445 --> 03:17.071
What, a time machine was good,
but aliens is too far?

03:17.072 --> 03:19.241
Hey, I was not "good" with a time machine.

03:22.286 --> 03:24.163
Holy crap, there's someone in here!

03:25.372 --> 03:26.749
Oh, God.

03:28.083 --> 03:29.542
What happened to "don't touch it"?

03:29.543 --> 03:31.169
Adult female.

03:31.170 --> 03:35.006
Cause of death
looks like blunt force trauma.

03:35.007 --> 03:36.216
Key's still in the ignition,

03:36.217 --> 03:38.468
and the gear shift's in "drive."

03:38.469 --> 03:39.802
Was this a car accident?

03:39.803 --> 03:42.222
The odometer's only on 42 miles.

03:42.223 --> 03:44.182
This thing was right off the showroom floor

03:44.183 --> 03:46.059
before it ended up in this tree.

03:46.060 --> 03:49.103
So this is a brand-new old car?

03:49.104 --> 03:51.273
Do you think...

03:52.650 --> 03:55.027
Oh... here we go.

03:57.613 --> 03:59.906
I'll cover, you open.

03:59.907 --> 04:00.823
On three.

04:00.824 --> 04:02.325
It could be dangerous.

04:02.326 --> 04:03.743
That's what the gun's for.

04:03.744 --> 04:04.953
Okay,

04:04.954 --> 04:06.704
but don't...don't shoot me

04:06.705 --> 04:08.373
if something pops out and gets scary.

04:08.374 --> 04:09.791
Just open the damn trunk, Todd.

04:09.792 --> 04:11.085
Okay.

04:13.087 --> 04:14.587
Three...

04:14.588 --> 04:15.838
two...

04:15.839 --> 04:17.090
one.

04:23.097 --> 04:24.265
I'm free.

04:25.307 --> 04:27.308
I'm free!

04:27.309 --> 04:28.685
Ha ha!

04:28.686 --> 04:30.271
Oh, my God!

04:32.273 --> 04:33.439
Dirk!

04:41.282 --> 04:43.032
How long have you been in there?

04:43.033 --> 04:45.285
Farah thinks that car's been
in that tree for 50 years.

04:45.286 --> 04:46.577
No, it couldn't have been that long.

04:46.578 --> 04:48.538
I would've looked much older.

04:48.539 --> 04:49.831
Why are you wet?

04:49.832 --> 04:51.332
Now, that is a good question.

04:51.333 --> 04:53.001
Unfortunately,
I don't have a great answer.

04:53.002 --> 04:54.085
One minute, I was in bed,

04:54.086 --> 04:55.545
then Mona said, "Find the boy,"

04:55.546 --> 04:57.839
and then I fell through
into a world of wet trunkness.

04:57.840 --> 04:58.881
- Mona?
- Keep up, Todd.

04:58.882 --> 05:01.759
Mona is the main character
of that last thing I just said.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.219
You fell through a bed?

05:03.220 --> 05:05.179
- Where?
- Blackwing, naturally.

05:05.180 --> 05:06.472
You were in Blackwing!

05:06.473 --> 05:07.807
Yes, of course I was, Todd. Jesus...

05:07.808 --> 05:09.100
Did you see Amanda there?

05:09.101 --> 05:11.060
Well, they don't exactly let us
just wander around the halls

05:11.061 --> 05:11.978
and... wait, Amanda?

05:11.979 --> 05:14.272
So she could've been there
and you just didn't see her?

05:14.273 --> 05:15.982
Why would Amanda be at Blackwing?

05:15.983 --> 05:18.109
I mean, she's not like me, or the Rowdy 3,

05:18.110 --> 05:19.944
or Mona, for that matter.

05:19.945 --> 05:22.155
Okay, stop. Who is Mona?

05:23.324 --> 05:24.490
Oh no.

05:24.491 --> 05:25.867
What do we do?

05:27.911 --> 05:28.954
Oh.

05:30.539 --> 05:32.206
Uh... no...

05:32.207 --> 05:34.000
everything's fine!

05:34.001 --> 05:35.251
This is...

05:35.252 --> 05:36.253
It's just...

05:37.421 --> 05:38.755
This is a picnic!

05:38.756 --> 05:40.632
You are under arrest.

05:42.468 --> 05:43.593
For what?

05:43.594 --> 05:45.512
You are wanted by the FBI.

05:47.598 --> 05:50.266
Oh, my God,
you're wanted by the FBI?

05:50.267 --> 05:52.894
What did you guys do?

05:52.895 --> 05:54.812
<i>I have never arrested anyone before,</i>

05:54.813 --> 05:56.522
so you all should just, you know...

05:56.523 --> 05:58.984
be, uh, real cool about it.

06:01.403 --> 06:02.570
Oh.

06:03.530 --> 06:04.739
<i>Thank you.</i>

06:04.740 --> 06:07.117
That was a very cool thing for you to do.

06:07.910 --> 06:09.952
What do you mean,
you lost Dirk Gently?

06:09.953 --> 06:11.371
How did he escape?

06:11.372 --> 06:12.747
He didn't escape, he disappeared.

06:12.748 --> 06:13.706
Disappeared? He can do that?

06:13.707 --> 06:14.958
No, but he did.

06:19.630 --> 06:21.339
Rrrgh!

06:21.340 --> 06:22.215
Okay...

06:22.216 --> 06:25.927
is it possible...

06:25.928 --> 06:27.262
he's invisible?

06:31.558 --> 06:35.812
I've... already reviewed the footage, sir, and...

06:35.813 --> 06:37.314
I'm afraid there was a glitch?

06:38.273 --> 06:41.234
<i>The footage shows
Icarus asleep in the bed,</i>

06:41.235 --> 06:42.903
<i>then it jumps two seconds,
and he's gone.</i>

06:50.369 --> 06:54.832
Is it possible he peed himself invisible?

06:59.461 --> 07:00.879
Get me Mr. Priest.

07:08.053 --> 07:09.887
Jeez, you're still in bed?
What the heck?

07:09.888 --> 07:11.556
I'm sick, Bob.

07:11.557 --> 07:12.598
You've got to walk Agrajag.

07:13.475 --> 07:14.851
You walk him.

07:14.852 --> 07:16.519
He's your dog.
He doesn't like me.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.271
What is going on with you?

07:18.272 --> 07:21.023
I'm sick, Bob.

07:21.024 --> 07:22.818
Well, enjoy your spa day...

07:23.861 --> 07:25.069
but if Agrajag shits on the rug,

07:25.070 --> 07:26.070
you're cleaning it up.

07:39.751 --> 07:41.170
<i>Borobotos!</i>

08:02.065 --> 08:03.066
Oh...

08:05.652 --> 08:06.653
Okay...

08:12.659 --> 08:13.827
Pidendo.

08:27.299 --> 08:29.510
This thing cleaned my dang clothes.

08:46.902 --> 08:48.611
Hey, are you...

08:50.405 --> 08:52.156
Did Hobbs arrest you?

08:52.157 --> 08:53.241
Me?

08:53.242 --> 08:54.408
No.

08:54.409 --> 08:56.369
Maybe them, the ones inside.

08:56.370 --> 08:58.496
I'm just an associated figure,

08:58.497 --> 09:00.498
like a cousin, except not related,

09:00.499 --> 09:02.291
<i>so really not like a cousin.</i>

09:02.292 --> 09:03.501
<i>I'm more of...</i>

09:03.502 --> 09:06.546
I suppose I'm just kind of a... person?

09:06.547 --> 09:08.756
Jesus, Hobbs, what did you do?

09:08.757 --> 09:10.800
Hey, excuse me, I need the toilet.

09:10.801 --> 09:11.759
<i>Hey!</i>

09:11.760 --> 09:13.678
Oh, oh, oh, man, Tina!

09:13.679 --> 09:15.137
Some stuff is going on!

09:15.138 --> 09:16.639
Okay, whoa, calm down.

09:16.640 --> 09:17.807
Oh... okay, so...

09:17.808 --> 09:18.683
I got 'em inside.

09:18.684 --> 09:21.561
One of them is real grumpy.
The other one is just real weird,

09:21.562 --> 09:22.812
and that British guy over there,

09:22.813 --> 09:24.647
I don't know what the deal is, but...

09:24.648 --> 09:26.691
I'm telling you, he is...

09:26.692 --> 09:27.567
he is hilarious, Tina.

09:27.568 --> 09:29.193
Yeah. Right. Why is he cuffed?

09:29.194 --> 09:31.196
You're not going to believe
what they were doing when I found 'em.

09:33.156 --> 09:34.783
Marina Cardenas?

09:36.285 --> 09:38.119
Like... "Cardenas" Cardenas?

09:38.120 --> 09:39.705
I found them with her body.

09:40.747 --> 09:44.751
- You found Marina Cardenas' body?
- In a car, in a tree, T! In a tree!

09:45.836 --> 09:46.794
That's weird!

09:46.795 --> 09:48.254
Check out the address on there.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.964
It's for the old farmhouse
that got fenced off

09:49.965 --> 09:52.174
and seized by the government after The '67.

09:52.175 --> 09:54.051
Dude, this is like, um...

09:54.052 --> 09:55.636
This is the biggest goddamn thing
that's ever happened.

09:55.637 --> 09:56.637
Whoo!

09:56.638 --> 09:59.557
Wow, it sounds like you guys
are talking about something really...

09:59.558 --> 10:00.934
interesting.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.564
Just do it!
Come on, do it already!

10:06.565 --> 10:07.523
I'm going to do it!

10:07.524 --> 10:09.650
- Stop saying that! Just do it!
- Okay!

10:09.651 --> 10:11.444
Hey, uh, is everything okay?

10:11.445 --> 10:12.737
Get out of here.
Can't you see we're busy?

10:12.738 --> 10:14.364
This is a private moment.

10:17.284 --> 10:18.618
Okay. Bigger vision...

10:18.619 --> 10:19.702
go!

10:26.084 --> 10:27.169
Nothing.

10:28.670 --> 10:30.172
We're never going to find them this way.

10:31.757 --> 10:33.174
I've gotten too used to this.

10:33.175 --> 10:35.343
The attacks don't hit as hard anymore,

10:35.344 --> 10:36.427
so the visions,

10:36.428 --> 10:39.805
they're smaller, they're shorter...

10:39.806 --> 10:40.806
they're not useful.

10:40.807 --> 10:43.017
I'm sorry I'm not scary enough, boss.

10:43.018 --> 10:45.020
I can get, like, way scarier.

10:47.064 --> 10:48.939
I could be, like... a goblin!

10:48.940 --> 10:50.733
You're fine.

10:50.734 --> 10:52.318
You're super scary.

10:52.319 --> 10:53.569
I just...

10:58.158 --> 10:59.868
You want to try something crazy?

11:19.596 --> 11:22.224
Portebendo wejent-ah!

11:35.821 --> 11:37.989
No freaking way.

11:43.495 --> 11:46.665
No...freaking...way!

12:06.017 --> 12:07.226
Yup.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.562
Says here in the FBI report

12:09.563 --> 12:12.189
that you and Mr. Brotzman
have been connected directly or indirectly

12:12.190 --> 12:14.483
to the deaths of two dozen individuals.

12:14.484 --> 12:15.610
Only one was direct,

12:16.111 --> 12:17.778
and that was self defense
because he was the one

12:17.779 --> 12:19.697
responsible for all the other deaths.

12:19.698 --> 12:21.240
Mm-hm.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.242
Oh, and I shot a man with a sniper rifle,

12:23.243 --> 12:24.827
but I'm not a bad person.

12:24.828 --> 12:27.204
My whole life has been focused
on enforcing law,

12:27.205 --> 12:30.166
ever since that one time I stole
a Milky Way from the Circle-K downtown

12:30.167 --> 12:33.419
when I was nine, but I paid for that...
technically.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.172
It's a lot less than murder, so...

12:36.173 --> 12:39.341
God, why didn't I just listen to Eddie, hm?

12:39.342 --> 12:40.634
<i>Why am I such an idiot?</i>

12:40.635 --> 12:42.845
Am I just destined
to be this epic failure

12:42.846 --> 12:44.597
for the rest of my pathetic life,

12:44.598 --> 12:46.307
and can you please
just stop sitting there,

12:46.308 --> 12:48.894
staring at me like
I'm some kind of mental patient?

12:50.896 --> 12:52.856
How could you leave
these pens like this?

12:53.440 --> 12:56.859
I am not answering a single question
until I get my phone call,

12:56.860 --> 12:58.110
and maybe not even then.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.405
I have... rights!

13:00.822 --> 13:01.781
Speaking of which,

13:01.782 --> 13:03.407
I don't seem to remember
you reading me mine.

13:03.408 --> 13:04.909
Is this some kind of fascist thing?

13:04.910 --> 13:07.329
Are you Todd Brotzman
from The Mexican Funeral?

13:10.582 --> 13:11.583
Um...

13:12.417 --> 13:13.418
yeah?

13:17.130 --> 13:18.964
You're, like...

13:18.965 --> 13:21.885
a god of the Seattle mid-2000 alt scene, dude.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.470
What, like...

13:24.471 --> 13:26.013
seriously?

13:26.014 --> 13:28.182
You're, like, a fan?

13:28.183 --> 13:30.685
This is the coolest day of my life.

13:33.688 --> 13:35.524
Oh, well, it's, like...

13:36.775 --> 13:38.901
no big deal.

13:38.902 --> 13:41.529
So he'd basically created a time loop

13:41.530 --> 13:43.739
by trying to avenge the
loss of his own machine,

13:43.740 --> 13:46.033
causing a doubling effect
where there were now two machines,

13:46.034 --> 13:48.369
or even three, or maybe even debatably four

13:48.370 --> 13:49.787
at one point in the timeline,

13:49.788 --> 13:50.996
and at some point in there,

13:50.997 --> 13:52.832
he built a steampunk suit of armor.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.959
This was Patrick Spring who did this?

13:54.960 --> 13:57.002
Or rather, Zachariah Webb
as Patrick Spring

13:57.003 --> 13:59.089
in a final ill-fated journey into the future?

14:00.006 --> 14:01.507
Um, Mr. Hobbs?

14:01.508 --> 14:03.384
Confidentially, as a detective,

14:03.385 --> 14:05.678
this is easily the best interaction
with a police officer

14:05.679 --> 14:07.180
I have ever had.

14:08.306 --> 14:11.058
You know, I was named after a detective.

14:11.059 --> 14:12.059
My name's Sherlock.

14:12.060 --> 14:13.812
Guess which one I was named after.

14:16.773 --> 14:19.775
I'm actually a holistic detective,
to be precise, which means...

14:19.776 --> 14:20.818
Holistic?

14:20.819 --> 14:22.069
Uh, you mean, like...

14:22.070 --> 14:23.864
the interconnectedness of all things?

14:25.407 --> 14:27.157
I...

14:27.158 --> 14:28.368
love you?

14:31.872 --> 14:34.164
You can't break through the wall, Todd.

14:35.876 --> 14:36.959
Okay, Dirk.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.545
Time to get you back in your cell, huh?

14:43.592 --> 14:46.176
Thanks, Sheriff.
I'll be in here if you need me.

14:46.177 --> 14:48.888
Ha! Yes, I believe you will.

14:48.889 --> 14:50.307
Okay. Ahem.

14:50.974 --> 14:53.058
- Just give me a minute.
- Hey, hey, don't call the...

14:53.059 --> 14:54.518
whoever they want you to call, okay?

14:54.519 --> 14:55.394
Just a minute.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.812
They're dangerous.
This isn't what you think.

14:56.813 --> 14:58.939
Don't call the FBI... or whoever.

14:58.940 --> 15:01.192
You know, I really don't think he's going to.

15:01.902 --> 15:04.445
I don't know how you can
possibly be so optimistic right now.

15:04.446 --> 15:06.655
How did you end up here?
In Bergsberg?

15:06.656 --> 15:08.365
We were looking for you.

15:08.366 --> 15:11.076
Exactly, and here I am.
So there you are.

15:11.077 --> 15:12.578
Everything is connected, and blah blah.

15:12.579 --> 15:13.537
We're in jail.

15:13.538 --> 15:15.789
Well, we're at least kind of meant to be here.

15:15.790 --> 15:17.041
It must be part of the new case.

15:17.042 --> 15:19.293
- Our new case?
- New case? No, listen, Dirk.

15:19.294 --> 15:20.628
I need you to help me find Amanda.

15:20.629 --> 15:23.715
Yes, we'll get to that, but first,
I have to... are you ready for this?

15:25.091 --> 15:27.177
"Find the boy."

15:28.053 --> 15:29.219
What boy?

15:29.220 --> 15:30.512
I have no idea.

15:30.513 --> 15:31.805
Is it a missing persons case?

15:31.806 --> 15:32.806
I guess so.

15:32.807 --> 15:33.891
- How old is he?
- Don't know.

15:33.892 --> 15:35.976
Where did he go missing?
What does he look like?

15:35.977 --> 15:37.353
How long has he been gone?

15:37.354 --> 15:39.313
All excellent questions, Farah.

15:39.314 --> 15:41.440
You are doing great questions right now,

15:41.441 --> 15:43.108
and I am hearing all of them.

15:43.109 --> 15:44.485
Who hired you?

15:44.486 --> 15:46.362
Mona Wilder was the one who mentioned it,

15:46.363 --> 15:49.031
but I'm not sure if she's actually
got the means to pay us...

15:49.032 --> 15:50.784
Who is Mona Wilder?

15:51.952 --> 15:54.995
She's a Blackwing subject
I hadn't seen in 15 years,

15:54.996 --> 15:56.705
and Todd, with that kind of attitude,

15:56.706 --> 15:58.082
I'm demoting you back to assistant.

15:58.083 --> 15:59.084
I...

15:59.501 --> 16:00.502
but...

16:03.380 --> 16:05.465
How did I forget how annoying you are?

16:15.225 --> 16:17.977
- So what now, boss?
- I saw a train in my vision.

16:17.978 --> 16:18.979
Okay.

16:23.984 --> 16:25.275
Uh...

16:25.276 --> 16:27.361
Hey, maybe we should, uh...

16:27.362 --> 16:28.529
not do this?

16:28.530 --> 16:29.697
And we can go back to the car

16:29.698 --> 16:31.490
and, like, listen to, uh, music?

16:31.491 --> 16:32.616
Hey, Vogel?

16:32.617 --> 16:34.159
- Be chill, okay?
- Okay.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.620
I know that this is crazy,
and you're scared,

16:36.621 --> 16:38.580
but every vision has led us to the next,

16:38.581 --> 16:39.707
and that's all led us to this, okay?

16:40.917 --> 16:42.543
Okay, yeah, but maybe...

16:49.509 --> 16:53.762
Todd, the cartoon method of escape...

16:53.763 --> 16:56.890
is that working out well for you,
is what I'm asking?

16:56.891 --> 16:59.435
Okay, I know you're calm,
but I'm not.

16:59.436 --> 17:01.228
I'm out of my medication,
we're under arrest...

17:01.229 --> 17:02.730
This may look dire,

17:02.731 --> 17:05.107
but I promise you,
everything will work out,

17:05.108 --> 17:06.108
just like it did last time.

17:06.109 --> 17:07.901
Last time? Seriously?

17:07.902 --> 17:09.528
Last time, you ended up getting kidnapped.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.280
Farah got all of her bank accounts frozen.

17:11.281 --> 17:12.823
We're all on the run from the FBI.

17:12.824 --> 17:14.575
Yes, but...

17:14.576 --> 17:16.201
I'm sorry, did you say "out of medication"?

17:16.202 --> 17:17.704
Out of medication for what?

17:19.205 --> 17:20.749
Out of medication for what, Todd?

17:26.963 --> 17:28.423
Pararibulitus.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.967
I had my first attack
the day you were taken.

17:31.968 --> 17:33.052
Wh... w...

17:33.053 --> 17:34.887
Listen, I know things
haven't been easy for you, Dirk,

17:34.888 --> 17:36.056
but this is...

17:37.307 --> 17:40.642
When I first met you, you said
the universe would reward us.

17:40.643 --> 17:43.103
Instead, we've all just been...

17:43.104 --> 17:44.105
punished.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.734
These things aren't always
what they seem, Todd.

17:48.735 --> 17:52.071
It may not always be easy or smooth,

17:52.072 --> 17:56.366
but somehow it all works out in the end...

17:56.367 --> 17:58.243
and if it doesn't, you're dead, so...

17:58.244 --> 18:00.204
you won't die though, actually, sorry.

18:00.205 --> 18:02.706
You, you are going to be okay.

18:02.707 --> 18:05.417
We are going to find your sister
and the boy,

18:05.418 --> 18:06.710
and probably we're going
to find absolutely anything

18:06.711 --> 18:07.879
if we look hard enough.

18:08.838 --> 18:10.298
We're never getting out of here.

18:11.508 --> 18:12.842
We're letting you guys out of here.

18:15.678 --> 18:16.679
Yep.

18:21.726 --> 18:23.519
Yeah, it's a little windy out there, Dirk,
so I brought you a jacket.

18:23.520 --> 18:24.394
Aw.

18:24.395 --> 18:26.313
I'm sorry, what?
You're taking us somewhere?

18:26.314 --> 18:28.774
Why exactly are you dressed
like an astronaut, anyway?

18:28.775 --> 18:32.028
I was in a government prison for psychics.

18:33.279 --> 18:34.113
That is...

18:34.114 --> 18:35.698
that is so dang cool.

18:36.699 --> 18:38.117
I'm Sheriff Sherlock Hobbs,

18:38.118 --> 18:40.078
and this is my deputy, Tina Tevetino.

18:41.121 --> 18:42.788
Five days sober! Sorta.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.540
And you guys are coming out with us.

18:44.541 --> 18:45.874
You're just letting us go?

18:45.875 --> 18:48.335
Oh, no, no. No, no, no.
No, sir. No, heck no.

18:48.336 --> 18:49.921
No, no, no, no. You are...

18:50.547 --> 18:52.840
we are temporarily not reporting you

18:52.841 --> 18:54.883
for temporary assistance
on an open investigation

18:54.884 --> 18:57.553
due to lack of current criminal activity
in the vicinity,

18:57.554 --> 18:59.556
and in the interim, you'll be assisting us.

18:59.889 --> 19:01.431
You're helping us 'cause you're bored?

19:01.432 --> 19:03.183
- Yes, bingo!
- No, Tina, would you... no,

19:03.184 --> 19:04.893
<i>and the dead woman you found
was actually part of a couple.</i>

19:04.894 --> 19:07.437
They've both been missing
for the past 50 years.

19:07.438 --> 19:08.397
<i>The address on the license</i>

19:08.398 --> 19:10.232
<i>made it seem like
it might be her house,</i>

19:10.233 --> 19:12.776
so we were thinking we'd
go poke around with you folks...

19:12.777 --> 19:13.902
maybe do a holistic.

19:13.903 --> 19:15.821
- "Poke around?"
- "Do a holistic?"

19:15.822 --> 19:17.948
Am I... in heaven?

19:17.949 --> 19:18.782
All right, out the door.

19:18.783 --> 19:20.242
Here we go, there we go.
Let's get moving.

19:20.243 --> 19:21.368
You...

19:21.369 --> 19:22.578
you are terrible police officers.

19:22.579 --> 19:23.453
Mm-hm.

19:23.454 --> 19:24.621
- What you're doing is illegal.
- Yeah, probably.

19:24.622 --> 19:25.998
Now, listen, Brotzman.

19:25.999 --> 19:27.124
Real quick...

19:27.125 --> 19:28.625
see, Mustard... that's my orange tabby...

19:28.626 --> 19:30.002
full of personality, loves rap...

19:30.003 --> 19:31.003
can't blame her...

19:31.004 --> 19:33.130
she's an epileptic,
and she takes these pills, Promadivan,

19:33.131 --> 19:34.715
much like the ones
you dropped yesterday.

19:34.716 --> 19:35.757
Now, it's a lower dosage,

19:35.758 --> 19:37.092
so you might need to take two, three...

19:37.093 --> 19:38.760
I don't know,
but I figure these could help you out.

19:38.761 --> 19:39.636
Seriously?

19:39.637 --> 19:40.596
Yeah.

19:40.597 --> 19:42.222
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

19:42.223 --> 19:43.600
Let's go.

19:45.435 --> 19:47.603
What a weird coincidence

19:47.604 --> 19:50.189
that Sheriff Hobbs
would just happen to have a cat

19:50.190 --> 19:52.274
that would just happen
to have the medication

19:52.275 --> 19:55.027
that you just happen to need, Todd.

19:55.028 --> 19:56.361
I think these people are crazy.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.031
Yes, I'm a bit worried about that.

20:01.242 --> 20:03.203
Aah!

20:08.166 --> 20:09.499
Oh, wow!

20:09.500 --> 20:10.918
It worked!

20:18.176 --> 20:20.052
<i>Closer now, closer now...</i>

20:20.053 --> 20:22.012
<i>to your purpose.</i>

20:22.013 --> 20:23.389
<i>Leave.</i>

20:23.973 --> 20:25.600
Boss? You okay?

20:26.351 --> 20:27.685
Say something!

20:30.188 --> 20:31.397
I know where to go.

20:42.492 --> 20:44.285
Pepdida tupedo.

20:47.247 --> 20:52.210
Bibini wosula ephrajio.

20:55.838 --> 20:58.508
Tomalu ephrajio.

21:04.931 --> 21:05.932
Mom?

21:07.350 --> 21:08.350
Mom?

21:08.351 --> 21:10.269
<i>Don't come in! I'm sick.</i>

21:10.270 --> 21:11.895
I don't want you to catch anything.

21:11.896 --> 21:13.605
I stayed home from work.

21:13.606 --> 21:14.773
<i>Okay, who cares?</i>

21:14.774 --> 21:16.858
Where'd you put
my goddamn car keys?

21:16.859 --> 21:17.943
<i>I didn't touch them,</i>

21:17.944 --> 21:19.361
but I'm sure
they're in the front pocket

21:19.362 --> 21:21.071
of whatever jeans
you wore yesterday,

21:21.072 --> 21:23.573
which are probably
on the floor in your bathroom.

21:23.574 --> 21:24.909
What do you think I am, an idiot?

21:25.159 --> 21:26.326
Well, I don't know, Scott.

21:26.327 --> 21:27.286
Why don't you check your jeans?

21:27.287 --> 21:29.789
Then I won't have to think you're an idiot,
'cause I'll know.

21:32.750 --> 21:34.084
<i>Whatever! You got lucky!</i>

21:34.085 --> 21:36.754
<i>I'm going out! I'll be home late!</i>

21:37.130 --> 21:39.172
Scott, I, uh... I'm...

21:39.173 --> 21:40.675
I'm sorry I was rude.

21:43.303 --> 21:44.304
Hon?

21:55.815 --> 21:58.443
How much do you know
about Dirk Gently?

21:59.652 --> 22:03.363
You know you don't have
to wear that thing, right?

22:03.364 --> 22:04.949
I'm not diseased.

22:09.912 --> 22:11.706
Thank you.

22:16.794 --> 22:18.170
Ow!

22:18.171 --> 22:19.463
Why?

22:19.464 --> 22:22.549
Oh, sorry.
I forgot that button did that.

22:22.550 --> 22:24.010
How much do you know
about Dirk Gently?

22:25.928 --> 22:27.888
I met him... once.

22:27.889 --> 22:31.391
Can Dirk teleport from, like, place to place?

22:31.392 --> 22:33.478
And what's the range
on something like that?

22:35.521 --> 22:38.857
The range? On teleportation?

22:38.858 --> 22:39.942
Look, I, uh...

22:40.777 --> 22:42.445
Don't shock me. Do not.

22:44.489 --> 22:47.075
Did you have Dirk captured
and then lose him somehow?

22:48.659 --> 22:51.370
Oh, great, if I say no...

22:51.371 --> 22:53.205
And you're coming to me again
to ask what to do?

22:53.206 --> 22:55.290
Who was I supposed to go to?

22:55.291 --> 22:56.666
The guy in the coma?

22:56.667 --> 22:58.377
The punk rock vampires?

22:58.378 --> 22:59.795
The government?

22:59.796 --> 23:01.714
You're, like, the only reasonable person.

23:03.966 --> 23:05.885
Listen, you're a nice guy...

23:06.928 --> 23:07.929
kind of.

23:08.805 --> 23:10.472
I wouldn't want to see you...

23:10.473 --> 23:12.724
you know...

23:12.725 --> 23:15.185
lose your job for,

23:15.186 --> 23:17.145
you know, losing a prisoner.

23:17.146 --> 23:19.940
So I'm willing to make a deal.

23:19.941 --> 23:20.941
What do you mean?

23:20.942 --> 23:23.652
I'd be willing to use my...
expertise in the area

23:23.653 --> 23:24.986
to help you find Dirk,

23:24.987 --> 23:29.866
if you'd agree
to some kind of <i>quid pro quo.</i>

23:29.867 --> 23:32.369
Dude, I don't speak Spanish.

23:32.370 --> 23:33.995
Right.

23:33.996 --> 23:36.373
Look, if you want
somebody to help you, okay,

23:36.374 --> 23:38.291
you start by helping them.

23:38.292 --> 23:39.835
For instance,

23:39.836 --> 23:41.920
you can start
by letting me out of this taxi.

23:41.921 --> 23:44.172
Dude, you're just...

23:44.173 --> 23:45.715
you're nailing it right now.

23:45.716 --> 23:46.716
You're nailing it.

23:46.717 --> 23:47.592
Yeah, finally.

23:47.593 --> 23:49.177
- Good talk.
- Yes!

23:49.178 --> 23:51.639
Yeah... no... Wait! Wait! Wait!

23:56.811 --> 23:59.856
Been wanting to do this since
the first time I saw the dang place.

24:18.249 --> 24:20.042
And you said
you people were here already?

24:20.418 --> 24:22.295
That's right.
But it was all locked up.

24:25.673 --> 24:26.673
Look at the door.

24:26.674 --> 24:27.883
What the hell?

24:27.884 --> 24:29.260
We didn't do that.

24:34.640 --> 24:37.268
This looks like it was
opened from the inside.

24:38.686 --> 24:41.771
One set of footprints,
wet from the rain.

24:41.772 --> 24:43.773
This must've happened
in the last 12 hours.

24:43.774 --> 24:45.817
So you're saying they
could still be in there?

24:45.818 --> 24:46.818
Dirk, where...?

24:46.819 --> 24:48.321
Maybe we should look over here.

24:50.031 --> 24:54.451
Is he being, like, holistic,
or just rude,

24:54.452 --> 24:56.077
or just, like... dumb?

24:56.078 --> 24:57.205
Mixed bag.

24:58.122 --> 24:59.247
Tina?

24:59.248 --> 25:00.458
- Go.
- Got it.

25:02.376 --> 25:04.419
Okay, looks like it's just the two of us.

25:04.420 --> 25:06.296
Let's go in there and take a look.
Take one of these.

25:06.297 --> 25:08.507
Why do you have two flashlights?

25:08.508 --> 25:09.758
They said I couldn't carry two guns,

25:09.759 --> 25:11.510
and the dang belt
has about four extra slots,

25:11.511 --> 25:13.386
so it's one of those "why not?"
type of situations.

25:13.387 --> 25:14.388
Got it.

25:32.740 --> 25:34.783
Looks like there was a fire in here.

25:34.784 --> 25:36.535
Hm, no, no...

25:36.536 --> 25:37.953
No, those burn marks
happened all over town

25:37.954 --> 25:41.206
after the power surge back in The '67.

25:41.207 --> 25:42.916
What's The '67?

25:42.917 --> 25:45.961
Well, Ms. Black, back in 1967,

25:45.962 --> 25:48.171
there was an electrical pulse
that ruined the power grid

25:48.172 --> 25:50.757
and fried electronics
for miles around Bergsberg.

25:50.758 --> 25:53.302
Crops died. Farms failed.
Most everybody left town.

25:54.303 --> 25:55.136
That Marina,

25:55.137 --> 25:58.348
the woman that you found
out there in the dang tree,

25:58.349 --> 25:59.808
and her husband, Hector,

25:59.809 --> 26:01.394
they went missing days beforehand.

26:03.563 --> 26:05.231
Guess this was their place.

26:06.315 --> 26:08.817
I always just knew them
as a name on the motel.

26:08.818 --> 26:12.404
Does this have anything to do with
that boat in the middle of that field?

26:12.405 --> 26:14.447
Oh, the Infant Male Pollock Francis?
No, no, no.

26:14.448 --> 26:18.201
That'd been there for at least ten years
before The '67 even happened,

26:18.202 --> 26:19.829
but no one knows
where that came from either.

26:22.623 --> 26:23.791
Okay, this is weird.

26:24.875 --> 26:26.918
You know, all the other phone jacks
have been ripped clean out,

26:26.919 --> 26:28.421
but this one's still here.

26:32.633 --> 26:33.759
Nope, nothing.

26:36.137 --> 26:39.347
Someone cleared out this whole place.

26:39.348 --> 26:41.517
Why would they leave one phone?

26:42.977 --> 26:44.312
Hobbs...

26:45.438 --> 26:46.855
More footprints.

26:46.856 --> 26:47.857
Over here.

26:49.734 --> 26:50.943
What've you got there?

27:00.494 --> 27:01.495
Huh...

27:04.290 --> 27:07.292
Could belong to the fella
broke open the door.

27:07.293 --> 27:09.586
How did he appear
in the middle of the room?

27:09.587 --> 27:10.796
Yeah...

27:15.134 --> 27:17.093
So, I read in your report

27:17.094 --> 27:19.596
that you're trained
in this kind of stuff.

27:19.597 --> 27:21.848
How come you never became a...

27:21.849 --> 27:24.851
you know, a something?

27:24.852 --> 27:26.978
My whole family's
in law enforcement,

27:26.979 --> 27:29.022
except me.

27:29.023 --> 27:30.815
It just kind of
worked out that way.

27:30.816 --> 27:32.400
Shit, really?

27:32.401 --> 27:34.277
Mine too.

27:34.278 --> 27:35.362
I feel like I could never live up

27:35.363 --> 27:36.655
to their expectations,
though, you know.

27:36.656 --> 27:38.783
Bah, probably sound dumb to you.

27:39.367 --> 27:41.077
Doesn't sound dumb.

27:48.793 --> 27:49.960
Ms. Black?

27:51.671 --> 27:53.631
Yeah, I... I thought
I heard something.

28:03.474 --> 28:04.475
Spodeekadak.

28:43.889 --> 28:45.473
I'm right, right, and Farah's wrong?

28:45.474 --> 28:47.225
There's something here.

28:47.226 --> 28:49.269
It's a circle, Todd.

28:49.270 --> 28:51.688
Exactly, but, it's, like, wet, right?

28:51.689 --> 28:53.022
That means something?

28:53.023 --> 28:55.901
Yes, for fans of wet circles,
I suppose it's very exciting.

29:00.698 --> 29:03.074
So how's this leading
him to find a boy?

29:03.075 --> 29:04.951
That's what he wants, right?

29:04.952 --> 29:06.995
If Dirk's doing it,
it's leading him somewhere.

29:06.996 --> 29:08.663
So basically he ignores
whatever you say

29:08.664 --> 29:10.832
and then does some random shit
for no reason?

29:10.833 --> 29:13.334
Yeah, that kind of sums it up.

29:13.335 --> 29:15.170
You blew up your life for this?

29:15.171 --> 29:18.256
Hey!
There's something up here.

29:18.257 --> 29:20.216
Dirk, how did you get up there?

29:20.217 --> 29:22.886
I climbed the thing.

29:22.887 --> 29:25.597
So, so what about
you and Farah?

29:25.598 --> 29:27.265
You've been on the
road for a while.

29:27.266 --> 29:29.267
I wouldn't have put
you two together.

29:29.268 --> 29:31.019
We're...

29:31.020 --> 29:32.229
we've gotten close.

29:33.189 --> 29:34.814
On the run.

29:34.815 --> 29:36.816
So hot.

29:36.817 --> 29:38.359
Bonnie and Clyde.

29:38.360 --> 29:39.903
Oh, was she your Yoko,

29:39.904 --> 29:42.363
or is that, like, Dirk?

29:42.364 --> 29:44.283
Like, was that the reason
why Mexican Funeral broke up?

29:45.409 --> 29:46.326
No.

29:46.327 --> 29:49.538
I was my own Yoko long before
these people ever showed up.

30:04.178 --> 30:05.679
<i>Raise 'em.</i>

30:20.945 --> 30:22.654
Shock them awake.

30:23.697 --> 30:24.697
Welcome home!

30:24.698 --> 30:26.366
I come awake in a scary way!

30:26.367 --> 30:27.784
What a rush.

30:27.785 --> 30:29.285
You guys were here
the whole time?

30:29.286 --> 30:30.370
I knew I smelled something.

30:30.371 --> 30:31.287
We're hanging from the ceiling.

30:31.288 --> 30:32.247
It got awful lonely down there.

30:32.248 --> 30:33.164
I was just asleep.

30:33.165 --> 30:34.666
- That whole time?
- I'm a tired guy.

30:34.667 --> 30:35.625
Hey...

30:35.626 --> 30:37.001
I sure am happy
to see you guys!

30:37.002 --> 30:37.836
Yeah, this is great!

30:37.837 --> 30:39.003
Ha ha...

30:39.004 --> 30:40.129
no, it isn't.

30:40.130 --> 30:41.589
- Not great.
- Actually, it's really bad.

30:41.590 --> 30:43.716
Okay, send two of them
back down

30:43.717 --> 30:45.927
and gas them out.
I only need to talk to one.

30:45.928 --> 30:47.095
<i>Which one, sir?</i>

30:47.096 --> 30:48.721
The one that talks normal!

30:48.722 --> 30:50.390
Aw, shit, that isn't is me.

30:50.391 --> 30:51.599
I talk good!

30:53.352 --> 30:54.520
Hello...

30:56.480 --> 30:57.939
Martin.

30:57.940 --> 30:59.065
I'm Supervisor Friedkin...

30:59.066 --> 31:00.818
You don't think
I remember you, boy?

31:02.278 --> 31:04.279
You and I have an appointment.

31:04.280 --> 31:05.405
Uh...

31:05.406 --> 31:08.616
You know we eat
neurological energy, right?

31:08.617 --> 31:10.743
You know we can smell fear?

31:10.744 --> 31:12.370
Okay, you listen to me...

31:12.371 --> 31:13.621
Now, I don't know
if you've got a better idea

31:13.622 --> 31:15.415
than just keep us
locked up in this floor,

31:15.416 --> 31:17.500
but taking me out
was a bonzo bad idea.

31:17.501 --> 31:19.043
I wanted to ask for your help.

31:19.044 --> 31:21.170
You know, when we feed
off other weirdos like us,

31:21.171 --> 31:23.673
it don't hurt 'em, but normal people?

31:23.674 --> 31:25.633
It can go very, very wrong.

31:25.634 --> 31:28.386
I need you to find Dirk Gently.

31:28.387 --> 31:30.889
You guys can find him
wherever he is, right?

31:30.890 --> 31:33.266
You were, like,
living off of him or whatever?

31:33.267 --> 31:36.394
<i>And I'll get you
better living quarters,</i>

31:36.395 --> 31:39.147
<i>or I could get you something
to eat somehow, or...</i>

31:39.148 --> 31:42.066
You... want my help?

31:42.067 --> 31:43.192
Yes.

31:43.193 --> 31:44.944
Well, you're off to an A-plus start.

31:44.945 --> 31:47.280
You just brought me something to eat.

31:47.281 --> 31:48.282
What?

32:04.340 --> 32:05.966
You asked for Mr. Priest?

32:13.849 --> 32:15.058
Okay, this is a good spot.

32:15.059 --> 32:16.393
Cool.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.907
Holy shit.
That's bananas.

32:36.163 --> 32:37.414
Give, give, give, give.

32:44.296 --> 32:45.297
Ha!

32:46.423 --> 32:48.132
Do you know how it works?

32:48.133 --> 32:50.301
Yes, you point it,
and you pull this trigger here...

32:50.302 --> 32:51.302
Give it back.

32:51.303 --> 32:52.304
Right.

32:58.686 --> 33:00.645
Hey, uh...

33:00.646 --> 33:02.689
Todd Brotzman?

33:02.690 --> 33:04.190
I'm freaking out.

33:04.191 --> 33:06.484
I mean, I'm really losing
my shit right now.

33:06.485 --> 33:08.820
Well, this is only my second case,

33:08.821 --> 33:10.196
but it'll probably get
a lot weirder than this.

33:10.197 --> 33:11.239
It can't get weirder than this.

33:11.240 --> 33:12.281
Excuse,

33:12.282 --> 33:14.785
but there's a person in this tree.

33:20.833 --> 33:22.709
Yeah, these are fingers.

33:22.710 --> 33:24.669
This little bit of hair
on the middle knuckle

33:24.670 --> 33:27.714
means this finger is connected
to an adult male.

33:27.715 --> 33:31.801
As to how that man got preserved
and mummified inside a tree...

33:31.802 --> 33:34.846
Is it possible
he ate some tree seeds,

33:34.847 --> 33:36.139
or a baby tree,

33:36.140 --> 33:38.975
then developed a stomachache,
went to sleep here, and...

33:38.976 --> 33:40.309
Nope.

33:40.310 --> 33:42.437
This could be the missing
husband, Hector Cardenas.

33:42.438 --> 33:45.148
So say we found
the couple who lived here.

33:45.149 --> 33:46.190
What about their child?

33:46.191 --> 33:47.442
Who said anything about a child?

33:47.443 --> 33:49.027
There was nothing about a kid in the file.

33:49.028 --> 33:52.113
In the house, I saw
scratch marks on a doorframe,

33:52.114 --> 33:53.656
like marking out
someone's height as they grow,

33:53.657 --> 33:55.074
like you would do with a child.

33:55.075 --> 33:57.702
Yes, of course!

33:57.703 --> 34:00.121
Argh! It's so obvious!

34:00.122 --> 34:01.914
The Cardenases had a child,

34:01.915 --> 34:04.500
and that child
could have been a boy!

34:04.501 --> 34:05.710
"The" boy.

34:05.711 --> 34:07.378
"Find the boy."

34:07.379 --> 34:08.921
Ha! Solved it!

34:08.922 --> 34:10.382
Oh! Oh.

34:12.634 --> 34:14.469
Did you solve anything, though?

34:14.470 --> 34:15.928
- No.
- Not even kind of.

34:15.929 --> 34:17.890
Just let me have this moment.

34:21.769 --> 34:22.770
Okay.

34:29.443 --> 34:30.611
Gah!

34:33.072 --> 34:34.781
I mean...

34:34.782 --> 34:36.240
oh.

34:37.326 --> 34:39.286
Hello, Mr. Priest.

34:42.372 --> 34:44.499
I'm glad you're here.

34:44.500 --> 34:46.250
Thanks for stepping in there.

34:46.251 --> 34:47.877
You can't get that close
to Project Incubus

34:47.878 --> 34:49.630
without stunning them...

34:51.423 --> 34:53.382
especially if you're going
to starve them out.

34:53.383 --> 34:55.468
I don't mean to be starving them.

34:55.469 --> 34:58.430
Well, then find some people
to let them drain the life out of.

34:59.515 --> 35:01.349
What... you mean, like...

35:01.350 --> 35:02.391
sacrifices?

35:02.392 --> 35:03.559
Yes.

35:03.560 --> 35:05.353
I can't... I can't do that.

35:05.354 --> 35:08.815
I can't let anyone experience
what just happened to me.

35:08.816 --> 35:10.858
Then you're soft.

35:10.859 --> 35:13.694
I've been doing this a long time.

35:13.695 --> 35:15.322
Soft guys melt.

35:16.782 --> 35:19.535
I help people get got
and gotten absolutely.

35:20.953 --> 35:26.124
I brought in 30 of the 42 Blackwing subjects
from the old project.

35:26.125 --> 35:27.500
Ooh...

35:27.501 --> 35:28.835
most fun I've ever had.

35:30.295 --> 35:31.504
G... good.

35:31.505 --> 35:34.091
Which begs the question,
why'd you only think to call me in now?

35:35.134 --> 35:38.011
I was told that there were
violations of protocol.

35:39.513 --> 35:41.389
You know...

35:41.390 --> 35:44.725
you may not be aware,
but they call me in for violations,

35:44.726 --> 35:46.269
not protocol.

35:46.270 --> 35:48.104
Yeah,
if my name is in the logbook,

35:48.105 --> 35:50.815
then ethics is not a priority.

35:50.816 --> 35:51.984
I'm a...

35:53.861 --> 35:54.862
Listen.

35:56.280 --> 35:58.157
I'm a very bad person.

35:58.574 --> 36:00.992
I'm a scary monster.

36:00.993 --> 36:01.993
I'm a...

36:01.994 --> 36:03.619
I'm...

36:03.620 --> 36:07.248
I'm no good, Hugo.
I'm troubled.

36:07.249 --> 36:09.542
Now, Project Icarus is gone.

36:09.543 --> 36:11.169
Project Incubus is dying.

36:11.170 --> 36:13.129
You got three normal civilians

36:13.130 --> 36:14.714
that have thus far gone uncaptured.

36:14.715 --> 36:18.634
You are living in a world
full of empty rooms that need filling.

36:18.635 --> 36:19.594
Someone up high somewhere,

36:19.595 --> 36:21.429
they're going to see
this is out of control,

36:21.430 --> 36:23.848
and you are going
to be embarrassed,

36:23.849 --> 36:26.767
and you are going
to be replaced,

36:26.768 --> 36:29.646
but I can give you a win.

36:36.111 --> 36:38.446
A rash of assaults
and sightings.

36:38.447 --> 36:41.157
Incubus Number Four and the Brotzman girl,

36:41.158 --> 36:42.742
the one who embarrassed you.

36:42.743 --> 36:44.327
I can get them.

36:44.328 --> 36:46.787
You've just had this information?

36:46.788 --> 36:48.873
So have you,
if you read the reports,

36:48.874 --> 36:50.666
but you don't, do you?

36:50.667 --> 36:53.127
I like that in a leader.

36:53.128 --> 36:55.672
I like a guy
who doesn't sweat the details.

36:58.133 --> 37:01.302
So, you can, like, find these people?

37:01.303 --> 37:03.763
I'm just a gun, Friedkin.

37:03.764 --> 37:05.557
I don't do anything
unless you pull the trigger.

37:43.553 --> 37:44.596
Suzie?

37:47.391 --> 37:48.558
Suze?

37:49.851 --> 37:51.561
You still sick?

37:59.278 --> 38:02.280
I'm feeling much better, thanks.

38:02.281 --> 38:03.407
Good.

38:05.242 --> 38:06.534
You notice anything different?

38:06.535 --> 38:08.327
You cleaned up a bit?

38:09.955 --> 38:12.290
Hey, I'm going to need your help
down at the motel tomorrow.

38:12.291 --> 38:14.917
All those music show people
coming to town...

38:14.918 --> 38:16.335
You don't notice anything else?

38:16.336 --> 38:17.795
New makeup?

38:17.796 --> 38:18.796
Makeup.

38:18.797 --> 38:21.090
- Haircut?
- Haircut.

38:21.091 --> 38:22.341
How much did all that cost?

38:22.342 --> 38:24.176
Bob...

38:24.177 --> 38:25.721
I look amazing.

38:26.888 --> 38:28.472
Say something about it.

38:30.100 --> 38:31.101
Suzie...

38:31.935 --> 38:33.728
ever since the accident,

38:33.729 --> 38:35.271
you have been up and down,

38:35.272 --> 38:36.522
up and down.

38:36.523 --> 38:38.149
I don't know what you did to yourself,

38:38.150 --> 38:40.359
who you hired, or how much it cost,

38:40.360 --> 38:42.820
but none of it
is going to fix what happened.

38:42.821 --> 38:43.946
We're not talking about that.

38:43.947 --> 38:45.781
We're talking about me.

38:45.782 --> 38:47.825
Well, maybe we should talk about it.

38:47.826 --> 38:49.910
It's like you're on some kind of...

38:49.911 --> 38:53.914
niceness self-improvement kick...

38:53.915 --> 38:55.583
but you're still the same you.

38:55.584 --> 38:57.835
You don't fool me, Suze.

38:57.836 --> 38:59.503
You may seem like
a sweet little mouse,

38:59.504 --> 39:01.548
but no matter what you do
on the outside...

39:03.300 --> 39:04.467
you can't change
who you really are.

39:04.468 --> 39:05.927
Dolomos!

39:12.309 --> 39:13.601
Okay.

39:17.814 --> 39:19.774
I'm really sorry, Bob.

39:19.775 --> 39:22.318
I am. I, uh...

39:22.319 --> 39:24.236
I didn't want to do that,

39:24.237 --> 39:25.863
but you...

39:25.864 --> 39:27.365
you're pushing my buttons,
you know?

39:27.366 --> 39:28.491
You always just...

39:28.492 --> 39:30.827
you know how
to just push my buttons.

39:36.458 --> 39:37.959
Can you hear me?

39:39.044 --> 39:39.919
Yip!

39:42.339 --> 39:44.340
See?

39:44.341 --> 39:45.841
You're fine!

39:45.842 --> 39:47.426
He's fine.

39:47.427 --> 39:49.762
Yeah, I, I did this for us.

39:49.763 --> 39:51.223
It's more productive this way.

39:52.182 --> 39:53.474
Yip!

39:57.270 --> 39:58.729
Close the fridge.

40:10.200 --> 40:11.952
Bob, could you please
go get rid of the dog?

40:29.928 --> 40:32.430
Oh...

40:32.431 --> 40:34.558
but isn't that silence nice?
