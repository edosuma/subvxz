00:03.037 --> 00:04.336
Oh, hey, shea.

00:04.338 --> 00:05.337
I don't see you smiling
like that

00:05.339 --> 00:08.106
Did something bad happen
to taylor swift?

00:08.109 --> 00:10.676
          No, the <i> region 7</i> movie
          is coming out tonight.

00:12.445 --> 00:15.147
            Based on the amazing
 post-apocalyptic graphic novel?

00:15.149 --> 00:18.484
I tend to stick to the more
pre-apocalyptic stuff.

00:18.486 --> 00:21.120
   According to the internet,
  the movie doesn't even suck.

00:21.122 --> 00:22.321
      I'm dying to see it.

00:22.323 --> 00:23.655
                           Well,
     as your official boyfriend,

00:23.657 --> 00:25.257
          It is my official duty
                    to take you.

00:25.259 --> 00:29.495
It's only playing
in the megadome in 3-d.

00:29.497 --> 00:32.731
               Uh, the megadome?

00:32.732 --> 00:35.734
            Isn't that the place
           with the $16 tickets?

00:35.736 --> 00:38.203
       Plus four for 3-d glasses

00:38.205 --> 00:41.407
          And the ungodly markup
         on popcorn and candy...

00:41.409 --> 00:43.409
Uh, hey, so you walking me
to school or not?

00:43.411 --> 00:44.810
                      Of course.

00:44.812 --> 00:47.212
   I am your official boyfriend.

                       [quietly]
                which is, sadly,
             an unpaid position.

00:51.151 --> 00:52.751
             Boom!

00:52.753 --> 00:55.487
                 Gobble, gobble.
       Two more for the gobbler.

00:55.489 --> 00:57.790
You have no idea
how much I needed this.

[mumbling through food]

01:00.394 --> 01:02.394
    Hey, do you want to be alone
        with the dipping sauces,

01:02.396 --> 01:03.395
            Or what do you need?

01:03.397 --> 01:07.166
The kim jong-un stage
of her pregnancy right now.

01:07.168 --> 01:10.669
She's a ruthless, waddling
little dictator

01:10.671 --> 01:13.405
Who's denied her people
of all food.

01:13.407 --> 01:16.542
On this conflict-free,
sugar-free diet.

01:16.544 --> 01:18.110
It's supposed to be good
for the baby.

01:18.112 --> 01:19.812
She took the cookies.
She took the candy.

01:19.814 --> 01:21.447
Then she came for the ketchup.

01:21.449 --> 01:23.315
You can't take a man's ketchup.

01:23.317 --> 01:24.316
             Well, have no fear.

01:24.318 --> 01:25.818
                Sit back, relax,

01:25.820 --> 01:27.820
              Because you've got
          double-fried hot wings

01:27.822 --> 01:29.088
           Here at thunderballs.

   to the open-shirt convention?

01:41.769 --> 01:43.335
          And who is the hottie?

01:43.337 --> 01:46.672
Almost as hot
as this chipotle dipping sauce

01:46.674 --> 01:48.607
I'm about to get into
right here.

01:48.609 --> 01:51.110

         look at his penetrating
                      eye stare.

01:51.112 --> 01:52.511
      That's his signature move.

01:52.513 --> 01:54.313
                      It's like,
  "are you talking to me, chris,

01:54.315 --> 01:56.849
        Or are you trying to eat
       the skin off of my face?"

01:56.851 --> 01:59.384
Just like I'm eating the skin
off of these wings.

01:59.386 --> 02:01.320
   Could you stop with the wings
              for a second here?

02:01.322 --> 02:05.891
  This is a--this is a potential
       cheating situation, andy.

            "I told you so" ever

                    I was there.

05:02.436 --> 05:03.935
         He was in a dark corner

05:03.937 --> 05:07.406
                      Talking to
        a very attractive woman,

05:07.408 --> 05:11.510
   Leaning in real close to her,
                      like this.

05:11.512 --> 05:14.012
Like he was actually interested
in what she had to say?

05:14.014 --> 05:16.048
                     This is not
             an interested lean.

05:16.050 --> 05:17.749
           This is the sex lean.

05:17.751 --> 05:19.351
          I perfected this lean.

05:19.353 --> 05:20.419

05:20.421 --> 05:21.787
Chris is not you.

05:21.789 --> 05:24.523
He is sensitive,
and he's layered.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.091
        The only layers he has--

05:26.093 --> 05:27.559
                      Layer one,

05:27.561 --> 05:31.496

         with a shite-y haircut,

05:31.498 --> 05:33.532
           And layer number two,
                  cheating toad.

05:33.534 --> 05:37.102
On the contrary,
chris is a kind, worldly,

05:37.104 --> 05:39.805

whom I love.

05:39.807 --> 05:41.673

I love him.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.975
And I am planning a ritual
tomorrow night

05:43.977 --> 05:45.844
Where I'm gonna tell him
just that.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.780
   Why are you planning a ritual
       to tell him you love him?

05:48.782 --> 05:50.415
   And--but <i> why</i> do you love him?

05:50.417 --> 05:52.384
We're right together.

05:52.386 --> 05:54.653
He is the almond milk
in my chai.

05:54.655 --> 05:57.522
He is the kimchi
on my hemp dog.

05:57.524 --> 06:00.559
                I'm telling you,
        the kimchi has gone bad.

06:00.561 --> 06:02.861
Kimchi is meant to go bad, will.

all of its nutritional benefits.

Oh, she does.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.852
An emotional allowance.

at the movies,

my girlfriend.

       - I will pay you.

     we get this work done,

14:31.338 --> 14:34.038
