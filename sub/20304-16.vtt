NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:06.089 --> 00:07.549
Operation Big Broom is over.

00:07.632 --> 00:09.509
-By whose authority?
-By mine.

00:09.592 --> 00:10.719
-Next case.
-(gavel bangs)

00:10.802 --> 00:14.431
Wait a minute! You can't just let him
walk out of here. He's gonna kill me!

00:14.514 --> 00:18.393
If there's just some way to keep him away
from her for a few days.

00:18.476 --> 00:21.688
I can't very well not represent
my client's interest here.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.690
He just came at her and started slashing.

00:24.399 --> 00:28.028
-I think I'm too hard to live with.
-No, you're not.

00:28.111 --> 00:31.031
It's the first time he's seen me like that
with a naked judge.

00:31.114 --> 00:32.115
Paul Grogan.

00:32.198 --> 00:34.492
May I ask you why it is
that you would want a ticket?

00:34.576 --> 00:36.161
Because I want to go to court to fight.

00:36.411 --> 00:37.871
I wouldn't worry about the interview.

00:37.954 --> 00:40.790
I'd think the Justice Department
knows a class act when it sees one.

00:40.874 --> 00:43.960
One of these days, I'm gonna learn
to offend a better class of people.

00:44.753 --> 00:45.670
(shouts)

00:45.754 --> 00:47.088
You know my partner.

00:47.172 --> 00:48.506
Now you want a piece too?

00:48.590 --> 00:50.341
You're not as stupid as you look.

00:50.425 --> 00:52.719
NARRATOR:
<i>Coming tonight on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:52.802 --> 00:54.804
MAN: How's it feel to be dead, man?

00:54.888 --> 00:56.639
Your son killed a gang kid, Mr. Hawkins.

00:56.723 --> 00:58.683
The only law these kids know is payback.

00:58.975 --> 01:00.185
Can we get this over with?

01:02.562 --> 01:03.688
Get what over with?

01:03.772 --> 01:06.649
You took me to dinner
every Saturday night for a month.

01:06.733 --> 01:08.026
You called me a pistol.

01:08.359 --> 01:09.944
Bloods say yo!

01:12.363 --> 01:14.532
I get this way when I've been up all night

01:14.616 --> 01:16.534
phoning a hotel
where you never checked in.

01:16.618 --> 01:18.995
Anything happens to Hawkins,
I hope you didn't do it.

01:19.287 --> 01:22.832
Because then when I put my thumb
through your eye, it'll just be for fun.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.293
I stayed there
because it was nicer than a hotel room,

01:25.376 --> 01:26.628
and he was nice enough to offer.

01:26.711 --> 01:28.755
I have to know.
Did you sleep with this guy?

01:31.549 --> 01:32.801
PHIL: Item nine, people,

01:32.884 --> 01:36.179
regarding the recommencement
of Operation Big Broom.

01:36.721 --> 01:39.849
Despite yesterday's
curtailment of said operation,

01:40.391 --> 01:43.686
and for reasons which will not be
speculated upon at this time,

01:44.229 --> 01:46.356
the Broom will descend
once again this a.m.

01:46.439 --> 01:48.775
on the 1600 block of Dekker Avenue

01:48.858 --> 01:51.945
for the fourth consecutive day
of social sanitization

01:52.028 --> 01:56.032
under the continued direction
of Lt. Howard Hunter.

01:56.116 --> 01:59.202
Supporting cast, uniform and otherwise,
stands as follows:

01:59.285 --> 02:02.539
Tepaz, Hurley, Jekilek,
Eaton, Hill, Renko, Peterson,

02:02.622 --> 02:07.252
Joyce, Coffey, Bates, Gorman, Augustine,
and all EATer personnel.

02:07.335 --> 02:11.631
Item 10. Those of you
understandably concerned

02:11.714 --> 02:14.717
over the chief's alleged bout
with hydrophobia

02:15.135 --> 02:18.555
may be relieved to learn
that the responsible rodent,

02:18.638 --> 02:21.641
subsequently bludgeoned
by our own Detective LaRue

02:22.142 --> 02:25.395
and airfreighted to the Atlanta Disease
Control Center for further testing,

02:25.478 --> 02:29.065
has been conclusively
determined to be non-rabid,

02:29.149 --> 02:33.486
contrary to the initial misdiagnosis
by our local boys down at County Health,

02:33.862 --> 02:36.447
bringing to a fortunate end
the chief's painful

02:36.531 --> 02:38.992
one-day encounter with the needle.

02:39.075 --> 02:40.326
(groaning)

02:40.410 --> 02:43.329
More importantly, people, this terse memo

02:43.413 --> 02:45.748
from the State Health
Informational Bureau.

02:45.832 --> 02:49.836
And I quote, "The specter
of the rabid rat is a fallacy.

02:49.919 --> 02:53.298
The rodent-borne urban rabies epidemic
is likewise a fallacy.

02:53.715 --> 02:55.884
Rats do not carry rabies.

02:55.967 --> 02:59.470
We heartily discourage you
from insinuating this possibility

02:59.554 --> 03:02.098
upon an uninformed, overly imaginative

03:02.182 --> 03:04.434
and easily panicked
inner-city population."

03:04.517 --> 03:07.103
-MAN: That's right!
-(indistinct chatter)

03:07.187 --> 03:10.481
On a final and somewhat
less pathological note,

03:11.024 --> 03:14.694
peer-group kudos to our own
Officer Andrew J. Renko.

03:14.777 --> 03:16.362
(cheering)

03:16.446 --> 03:18.948
Coming off a rather ignoble
and well-publicized

03:19.032 --> 03:21.618
public exposure incident last weekend,

03:22.076 --> 03:24.370
said officer more than
redeemed himself yesterday

03:24.454 --> 03:27.957
with the above-and-beyond-the-call
rescue of three citizens

03:28.041 --> 03:30.001
from a blazing tenement on East Utica.

03:30.084 --> 03:32.629
-All right!
-(cheering)

03:32.712 --> 03:35.673
Among other things,
the flights of heroics inspired

03:35.757 --> 03:37.842
by a transfer to scooter duty.

03:37.926 --> 03:39.469
(laughter)

03:39.552 --> 03:42.347
Said transfer having
been revoked as of today

03:42.430 --> 03:46.017
in favor of a deserved return
to routine patrol.

03:46.100 --> 03:48.269
-All right, all right.
-(cheering)

03:48.353 --> 03:55.151
And a recommendation by Captain Furillo
for a Meritorious Service Award.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.986
-(cheering)
-All right, Renko.

03:57.570 --> 04:04.285
And our customary and less formal
Hill Street silver whistle salute.

04:06.079 --> 04:09.540
(whistles blowing)

04:12.835 --> 04:15.838
All right. That's it. Let's roll.
(chuckling)

04:15.922 --> 04:19.133
And hey, hey, hey, hey!
Let's be careful out there.

04:20.927 --> 04:21.970
You got the silver whistle, huh?

04:22.053 --> 04:24.472
(indistinct chatter)

04:30.228 --> 04:32.939
(whistle blows)

04:33.606 --> 04:37.193
-Hey, on me. Congratulations.
<i>-Mucho gracio, goombah.</i>

04:37.610 --> 04:40.363
-Real fine.
-Thank you very, very much.

04:40.446 --> 04:44.033
You know, Bobby, I could get used
to this hero routine real quick.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.827
Hill, Renko. We've got a knifing up
at Nichols High.

04:45.910 --> 04:46.995
They need backups, pronto.

04:47.078 --> 04:48.830
Welcome to the real world, hero.

04:49.163 --> 04:51.958
You know, I-I could go back and just, uh--

04:52.041 --> 04:54.961
-Yeah, you could, but--
-Good morning, Bobby, Andrew.

05:02.593 --> 05:03.428
Frank.

05:06.097 --> 05:07.932
-I am wearing a toupee.
-FURILLO: Mm-hmm.

05:08.474 --> 05:11.644
-I mean, I see.
-Well? What do you think?

05:11.728 --> 05:15.982
Uh, it, uh, certainly...
says something, Ray.

05:16.065 --> 05:18.651
I mean, it really makes a statement.

05:18.735 --> 05:22.447
Rosa says it makes me look
10 years younger, at least.

05:23.740 --> 05:24.782
Is there something wrong?

05:24.866 --> 05:28.870
Uh, no, no. I just have a slight headache.

05:28.953 --> 05:32.707
It's the change of weather.
Sinuses. Excuse me a moment.

05:37.211 --> 05:38.921
Uh-- (clears throat) Ray.

05:39.547 --> 05:43.551
These are new guidelines
on search and seizure.

05:43.634 --> 05:47.180
Uh, would you distribute them
to the appropriate personnel?

05:47.263 --> 05:48.097
Sure.

05:51.100 --> 05:52.935
Leo, Howard.

06:00.276 --> 06:01.861
That was the lieutenant, wasn't it?

06:03.363 --> 06:04.864
I believe so, Schnitz.

06:06.074 --> 06:09.243
Either that or an overly familiar
tango instructor.

06:10.244 --> 06:12.747
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

06:12.830 --> 06:14.582
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

06:14.665 --> 06:18.461
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

06:18.544 --> 06:20.088
(sirens wailing)

06:25.802 --> 06:29.472
(theme music playing)

07:27.113 --> 07:29.991
(siren blaring)

07:40.418 --> 07:43.588
(indistinct chatter)

07:50.636 --> 07:52.513
Hey, Raymond, you don't look so good, man!

07:52.597 --> 07:55.808
Yeah, puke! How's it feel to be dead, man?

07:55.892 --> 07:57.143
Hey, man! How would it feel

07:57.226 --> 07:59.312
if you had a little more
classroom decorum, man?

07:59.395 --> 08:00.354
How would that feel?

08:01.147 --> 08:05.026
So, uh, he, uh-- he came at me,
you know, and, uh,

08:06.360 --> 08:08.112
well, he pulled this blade, and I...

08:09.405 --> 08:10.948
I didn't have no-- I didn't have a choice.

08:11.032 --> 08:13.701
Okay. We'll get your side of the story
down at the station.

08:16.245 --> 08:21.083
Two years till retirement
and I try to break up a knife fight. Dumb.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.668
What else can you tell me, Mr. Jewett?

08:23.419 --> 08:24.962
Well, like I said, it was self-defense.

08:25.046 --> 08:28.549
They started to argue
and Eugene came at him with a knife.

08:28.633 --> 08:30.801
(groans) Easy, man.

08:32.887 --> 08:34.347
Raymond backed up far as he could,

08:34.430 --> 08:36.891
and then he grabbed
a screwdriver off the bench.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.310
He let the gang kid have it.

08:39.727 --> 08:41.437
I'd have done the same thing myself.

08:42.480 --> 08:46.526
-How did it start?
-With these kids, who knows?

08:46.609 --> 08:49.028
-Oh, man! Eugene was provoked!
-Pipe down.

08:49.111 --> 08:50.530
-Get your hands off me!
-I said pipe down!

08:50.613 --> 08:52.990
That punk jumped his turn on the lathe!

08:53.366 --> 08:55.451
You're dead, Hawkins!
You hear me? You're dead!

08:55.535 --> 08:59.622
-(all shouting)
-Be quiet, man! I mean it.

08:59.705 --> 09:01.832
-All finished here, Dibble.
-Yeah, okay.

09:02.875 --> 09:05.336
We'll need you down at the station
to sign a statement later, okay?

09:09.632 --> 09:12.385
Bobby, take him out the side

09:12.927 --> 09:15.096
because we've got the makings
of a full-scale riot in front.

09:15.179 --> 09:17.181
-All right.
-(glass breaks)

09:17.265 --> 09:20.601
Unlawful assembly. Unlawful assembly.

09:21.686 --> 09:24.272
Obstruction of pedestrian traffic.

09:25.064 --> 09:26.566
Loitering with intent?

09:29.777 --> 09:30.820
Frank?

09:32.280 --> 09:34.490
-When did you get in?
-About an hour ago.

09:36.033 --> 09:38.911
That's some party your guys
are throwing down on Dekker, Frank.

09:39.328 --> 09:42.957
I'm out of town less than 24 hours
and they repeal the Constitution.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.293
All the more reason
for you not to leave town, Counselor.

09:46.335 --> 09:49.005
Uh, we have some things
to talk about, Joyce.

09:50.756 --> 09:52.133
Twelve o'clock lunch okay?

09:53.759 --> 09:56.929
I better go interview
my first gross of suspects.

09:59.890 --> 10:03.561
This makes the fourth time in two months
these punks started up after my boy!

10:04.061 --> 10:06.772
And that's not even counting the times
that they come into my store,

10:06.856 --> 10:08.774
trying to rip me off, busting things up.

10:08.858 --> 10:10.234
And all on account of Raymond here

10:10.318 --> 10:13.946
refusing to join that gang of theirs,
the Blood, whatever they call themselves.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.407
The boy never been
in any trouble in his life!

10:16.490 --> 10:17.450
Thank you.

10:18.159 --> 10:21.370
Uh, Raymond, would you mind just telling
us your version of what happened?

10:21.454 --> 10:23.998
-He's already told you three times over!
-It's all right.

10:25.166 --> 10:30.338
Pop. Like I said, this Eugene,
he's one of the gang dudes,

10:30.796 --> 10:33.841
he started hassling me about going out
of turn on the lathe or something,

10:33.924 --> 10:35.343
but really he was just looking to mess

10:35.426 --> 10:37.386
on account I never joined
the Blood and all.

10:39.055 --> 10:42.475
And I told him to back off,
and he pulled this blade and...

10:46.520 --> 10:50.983
Well, that's-that's when I grabbed
that screwdriver off the workbench and...

10:51.192 --> 10:53.861
We've got a signed statement
from the shop teacher

10:53.944 --> 10:55.613
fully corroborating my client's story.

10:55.696 --> 10:58.366
Lieutenant, I've got an eleven o'clock
court appointment,

10:58.449 --> 11:02.870
and, uh, frankly, I don't feel at all
disposed to file on this.

11:03.245 --> 11:04.538
I don't think we have
any problem with that.

11:04.622 --> 11:06.332
Thank you for the quick disposition.

11:09.335 --> 11:11.629
You're free to go.
Thank you for your time, Raymond.

11:19.553 --> 11:21.347
Can I speak to you for a second,
Mr. Hawkins?

11:22.473 --> 11:25.351
Raymond! I'll be with you in a minute.

11:32.483 --> 11:33.901
You know this won't be the end of it.

11:35.528 --> 11:36.570
What are you talking about?

11:37.613 --> 11:39.782
Your son killed a gang kid, Mr. Hawkins.

11:39.865 --> 11:43.828
Self-defense or no, they won't be happy
until the score is even.

11:45.621 --> 11:48.416
Maybe they'll come after you, too,
or other members of your family.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.209
Listen to me, Hawkins.

11:51.794 --> 11:53.963
The only law these kids know is payback.

11:55.673 --> 11:59.260
All right. I'll take the boy out of school
for a couple of weeks.

11:59.343 --> 12:02.638
That grocery store of yours
is right in the heart of Blood turf.

12:03.305 --> 12:05.391
How long do you think it's gonna be
till they pay a visit?

12:06.517 --> 12:07.977
Then give me some protection.

12:08.185 --> 12:09.979
You're the police. That's your job!

12:10.062 --> 12:13.649
I can't stake out your store
24 hours a day, sir, much as I'd like to.

12:14.859 --> 12:16.277
We just don't have the manpower.

12:21.031 --> 12:22.616
I don't have an easy answer for this.

12:24.827 --> 12:26.245
I really don't, but...

12:27.246 --> 12:29.790
have you ever considered maybe
relocating to a different neighborhood?

12:32.752 --> 12:36.839
(laughs) I don't believe you.

12:37.465 --> 12:39.258
Is this what I pay my taxes for?

12:39.717 --> 12:42.595
I work my butt off for 20 years
trying to build a decent life,

12:42.678 --> 12:46.515
and the first sign of trouble,
you tell me, the police,

12:46.599 --> 12:48.517
that I ought to move.

12:49.351 --> 12:51.103
Hey, forget it, man.

12:51.979 --> 12:53.564
I got one shotgun under my counter.

12:53.898 --> 12:55.566
I'll go out and buy myself another one.

12:55.983 --> 12:57.568
For God's sakes, think about your son.

12:57.818 --> 12:59.361
At least send him out of town for a while.

13:01.363 --> 13:03.365
I ain't breaking up my family.

13:04.533 --> 13:05.743
Now, get out of my way.

13:13.626 --> 13:16.295
(door opens, closes)

13:19.507 --> 13:20.341
Let's go, Ray.

13:25.513 --> 13:27.139
Mary Hicks all over again.

13:28.474 --> 13:30.768
Something bad's gonna happen to that kid,
Frank. I just know it.

13:31.227 --> 13:33.395
Frank, your car is outside.

13:34.855 --> 13:36.941
Let's get Sonny Freeman
from Gang Intervention

13:37.024 --> 13:38.275
up here for a little talk.

13:38.526 --> 13:41.320
And let's get a plainclothes down
at Hawkins's store, okay?

13:41.403 --> 13:42.238
Right.

13:43.364 --> 13:47.159
-Mick? Can I talk to you for a second?
-Sure.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.454
As the troops are fond of saying,

13:50.538 --> 13:52.581
"That's why they make the badges round

13:52.665 --> 13:54.708
-instead of star-shaped."
-Why is that, Howard?

13:54.792 --> 13:58.212
Hurts less when they get jammed up
the old lower corridor.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.340
All right, people.

14:01.423 --> 14:04.260
Single file, ID's out.
This is not a clambake.

14:05.511 --> 14:09.557
Seriously though, Frank, I doubt there is
a captain in the entire department

14:09.640 --> 14:14.687
who could have a direct order to his men
publicly countermanded by the chief

14:14.854 --> 14:16.939
and handle it as well as you have.

14:17.815 --> 14:20.693
You may have been handed
the brown helmet, squire,

14:21.235 --> 14:23.696
but you sure wear it
like a goldarn party hat.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.156
Just keep it by the book, Howard.

14:30.327 --> 14:33.914
For God's sake, Neal, we're not talking
the My Lai massacre here.

14:33.998 --> 14:36.208
-Hey!
-We're talking psychology.

14:36.292 --> 14:37.334
You know, human dynamics.

14:37.418 --> 14:39.795
-Urban repression. Early retirement, babe.
-Hmm.

14:44.049 --> 14:44.967
Morning, children!

14:47.303 --> 14:49.597
You see, you got to dig this
on a gestalt level, man.

14:49.680 --> 14:52.600
You don't napalm these suckers.
You just show 'em a picture of the napalm.

14:52.683 --> 14:54.476
-Subtle, huh?
-Yeah. (chuckles)

14:54.560 --> 14:57.730
About as subtle as a .357
in a bowl of oatmeal. (chuckles)

14:57.813 --> 15:00.566
-Yo, Paulie!
-Hey, right on time.

15:00.649 --> 15:02.359
Hey, baby. Paulie Schoellkopf,

15:02.443 --> 15:04.236
-my partner Neal Washington.
-What's happening?

15:04.320 --> 15:06.780
Me and this bozo go all the way
back to junior high together.

15:06.864 --> 15:10.159
Hey, I pulled her in here this morning
around five o'clock. It was still dark.

15:10.242 --> 15:12.411
-Government property?
-Uh, his CO from 'Nam

15:12.494 --> 15:14.455
is the head honcho
at the Lafayette Armory.

15:14.538 --> 15:18.042
Yeah, Scottie Wheeler.
Look, I even got a parade permit.

15:18.125 --> 15:21.378
The dude that owns this building says
that if this does the trick,

15:21.462 --> 15:23.213
then we can keep it here all year.

15:25.799 --> 15:28.552
(marching drum plays)

15:30.971 --> 15:33.474
You know, I think one day
will be more than enough.

15:33.557 --> 15:35.851
-Yeah.
-(chuckles)

15:35.935 --> 15:38.395
-(engine whirring)
-(marching song continue playing)

16:02.336 --> 16:03.420
Get out of the way!

16:15.808 --> 16:17.768
Totally unauthorized, of course, but,

16:19.103 --> 16:20.145
goldarn it,

16:20.229 --> 16:25.818
the sight of that heavy metal
still sends a shiver up the old bowels.

16:36.453 --> 16:38.038
Hey. Look, man,
I don't want to hear about it.

16:38.122 --> 16:41.083
I am telling you, Neal,
all the great legends ain't dead.

16:41.166 --> 16:44.294
Okay, Lawrence is gone.
Rommel, Patton, they're gone.

16:44.378 --> 16:47.297
But in that great tradition,
there is still LaRue of the Hill!

16:48.340 --> 16:49.717
The desert rats.

16:50.843 --> 16:51.760
Where did he get the tank?

16:52.136 --> 16:54.972
I don't know.
Some acid-casualty buddy of his.

16:55.305 --> 16:56.598
He probably thought he was buying a jeep.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.350
Think I could talk to you
for a minute, Luce?

16:58.434 --> 16:59.935
-Mm-hmm.
-You don't mind, do you, Joe?

17:01.478 --> 17:02.479
Hey, no problem.

17:03.439 --> 17:05.441
I'll just finish this
under a parked car or something.

17:05.733 --> 17:06.984
Thanks. Great.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.531
That's exactly it, Robert.

17:13.323 --> 17:16.118
Don't you understand
the extraordinary chain of circumstances

17:16.201 --> 17:19.079
that led me to be outside
that burning building on my little Vespa?

17:20.456 --> 17:21.707
Kismet.

17:22.624 --> 17:24.543
I just kind of take it
with a grain of salt.

17:26.086 --> 17:28.422
Do you expect me to believe that
that was mere chance?

17:30.257 --> 17:31.842
-No, I guess not.
-No!

17:32.426 --> 17:34.303
That was a message, Bobby Hill.

17:34.678 --> 17:36.680
I was offered an opportunity
to clean up my act,

17:36.764 --> 17:38.307
an opportunity that I am taking now.

17:38.390 --> 17:40.142
I am going to lose weight.

17:40.225 --> 17:42.061
I am going to register my motorcycle.

17:42.144 --> 17:44.855
I am going to read a book a week,
not including--

17:44.938 --> 17:46.565
-Wait, wait. Hold it. Hold it. Renko.
-And finally--

17:46.648 --> 17:48.442
And you may laugh, if you will.

17:48.817 --> 17:51.361
I'm gonna study and pass
that sergeant's exam.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.157
Now, I know you think
you've been hearing all this before.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.534
-Oh, no. I've never heard this before.
-We'll see.

17:57.618 --> 17:59.078
-Time will tell.
-Yeah.

17:59.995 --> 18:03.457
Now, not to change the subject,
but I would like to address

18:03.540 --> 18:07.211
another set of circumstances,
Mr. Sugar Ray Hill.

18:07.753 --> 18:10.798
That is the dismantling
of one Salvadore Benedetto.

18:12.257 --> 18:14.635
-Don't know the man.
-Midtown vice.

18:14.968 --> 18:16.929
Got his watch wound
last night at Mulligan's

18:17.012 --> 18:19.348
around midnight
by an unnamed Black officer.

18:20.057 --> 18:20.974
Do tell.

18:22.643 --> 18:26.105
Would you care to, uh,
offer those knuckles for inspection?

18:28.107 --> 18:29.024
No.

18:29.775 --> 18:30.692
I see.

18:32.444 --> 18:33.362
(sighs)

18:34.530 --> 18:37.032
I don't want to have
this kind of situation, uh,

18:37.116 --> 18:38.617
continue between us, partner.

18:39.201 --> 18:40.202
What's that?

18:42.121 --> 18:43.622
Fighting another guy's battles.

18:46.542 --> 18:47.918
Understood. (sighs)

18:49.545 --> 18:53.674
Of course, you know that, uh,
I would've done the same for you.

18:55.175 --> 18:56.677
I know. (chuckles)

18:57.970 --> 19:00.931
-Only not as well.
-(both laugh)

19:02.349 --> 19:04.434
-Thank you, Bobby Hill.
-Forget about it.

19:05.435 --> 19:07.688
(sighs) What do ya say I take
care of this today?

19:07.980 --> 19:10.566
-All right. Thanks, Rusty.
-Hey.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.025
(sighs)

19:13.777 --> 19:14.695
Oh, mercy.

19:21.910 --> 19:24.663
No, I'm sorry. If you don't want
to answer it, it's none of my business.

19:24.746 --> 19:26.290
No, it's all right. It's okay.

19:27.040 --> 19:29.042
It's not like the subject
has never come up.

19:29.126 --> 19:31.795
(clears throat) Uh, Joe and I...

19:32.629 --> 19:35.299
have been sort of kissy-face,
I guess, for a while, and...

19:35.883 --> 19:37.593
And then at Christmas,
remember when I got hit?

19:38.135 --> 19:42.723
He came to the hospital
and spent the night, and, uh...

19:44.474 --> 19:46.810
and the short answer is no,
we have never made love.

19:47.978 --> 19:49.188
It's about Belker, isn't it?

19:51.773 --> 19:52.941
I don't know what to do.

19:53.984 --> 19:54.943
I mean, I really--

19:56.570 --> 19:58.906
I feel like something
might happen between us,

19:58.989 --> 20:00.782
but I-I just don't think I can let it.

20:02.492 --> 20:05.329
Aw, I guess I was hoping you'd tell me
you and Joe had slept together

20:05.412 --> 20:07.664
and it hadn't hurt anything
about your being a cop.

20:07.831 --> 20:08.957
(chuckles) Forget about it.

20:09.833 --> 20:13.003
(sighs) Robin, if you're gonna really be
serious about Mick

20:13.086 --> 20:14.379
and you really want
to take it all the way,

20:14.463 --> 20:16.965
you've got to know
that it could hurt your job.

20:17.799 --> 20:20.636
Oh, I guess I was just trying
to sell myself a bill of goods.

20:21.970 --> 20:23.722
You know, there are a lot of guys
on the force

20:23.805 --> 20:27.017
that would love to find
a reason to not trust us.

20:27.309 --> 20:29.603
This kind of stuff just makes it
more complicated.

20:32.773 --> 20:34.399
You really got the hots
for him, don't you?

20:35.651 --> 20:37.444
-Yeah.
-(both chuckle)

20:37.527 --> 20:39.154
I think he's sweet, and he's so kind.

20:39.238 --> 20:42.032
And I feel so comfortable around him. I--

20:42.115 --> 20:46.495
Robin, if you're gonna do this,
go into it with your eyes open.

20:47.788 --> 20:50.165
-Thanks, Luce.
-I got to go.

20:52.125 --> 20:53.293
I really appreciate it.

20:58.924 --> 21:01.635
-Then after that, we'll play it by ear.
-Henry Goldblume?

21:01.927 --> 21:04.346
-Thank you. Bye-bye. Yeah?
-Sonny Freeman.

21:04.596 --> 21:06.223
Got a message from Division
you needed to see me.

21:06.306 --> 21:09.351
Ah, if this isn't for Gang Intervention,
I don't know what is.

21:09.559 --> 21:12.145
It's about Ray Hawkins Jr. and his family.

21:13.689 --> 21:14.815
Don't place him.

21:14.898 --> 21:16.066
The kid who was being hassled
by the Bloods.

21:16.149 --> 21:17.818
Wound up with a justifiable homicide.

21:17.901 --> 21:20.445
In Gang Intervention we're calling that
the Coleman killing.

21:23.407 --> 21:25.242
It's a gang-related death.

21:25.325 --> 21:27.744
How the hell can you say
it's not your problem?

21:28.161 --> 21:30.205
Because the Hawkins boy is not in a gang.

21:30.414 --> 21:31.373
(sighs)

21:33.041 --> 21:34.543
I don't believe this.

21:35.752 --> 21:38.088
Lieutenant, our program spent
the last six months

21:38.171 --> 21:40.173
building credibility with the gangs.

21:40.549 --> 21:41.883
We've got a leg up on a treaty

21:41.967 --> 21:45.095
that'd hold for the Hill,
East Ferry and the Heights.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.556
Bloods would have to sign that treaty.

21:48.223 --> 21:49.683
I'd like to help you with this,

21:51.059 --> 21:53.478
but I'm not about to blow six months' work

21:53.770 --> 21:55.605
'cause you're worried about
one boy and his family.

21:55.897 --> 21:58.150
Yeah, you wouldn't want to put
your federal grant in jeopardy.

21:58.233 --> 22:01.695
Hey, there were 300 gang homicides
in this city last year.

22:02.404 --> 22:03.947
Now, if we blow this treaty,

22:04.865 --> 22:07.659
you people will be cleaning up the mess
for the next six months.

22:11.079 --> 22:12.331
Why don't you tell 'em to move?

22:14.458 --> 22:17.753
I did. We got a great police department.

22:18.295 --> 22:19.463
Got troubles? Get out of town.

22:28.138 --> 22:28.972
I'm sorry.

22:34.978 --> 22:36.188
There's somebody looking for you.

22:37.439 --> 22:38.857
I want to punch you in the mouth.

22:39.358 --> 22:40.609
-Why is that?
-How do you feel?

22:41.109 --> 22:42.194
Are you proud of yourself?

22:42.652 --> 22:44.237
I suppose you're talking
about Richard Brady.

22:44.321 --> 22:45.822
And Mary Hicks!

22:46.907 --> 22:50.911
Lieutenant, let me tell you something,
I am a public defender.

22:51.286 --> 22:55.499
I was assigned to defend Richard Brady
on a charge of assault.

22:55.832 --> 22:58.543
Now, he's got the right to be defended,
and I performed my duty.

22:58.627 --> 23:00.003
And now a girl is dead.

23:00.545 --> 23:03.215
(sighs) I am very sorry that happened.

23:03.757 --> 23:05.842
But I am not gonna get
into a crying contest with you,

23:06.218 --> 23:08.512
and I am not going to allow myself
to feel responsible.

23:08.595 --> 23:10.430
We are officers of the court.

23:10.514 --> 23:12.057
If we know a crime
is going to be committed--

23:12.140 --> 23:13.433
I did not!

23:14.434 --> 23:17.270
Did you? Did you have a legal certainty?

23:19.356 --> 23:21.274
Do you get this way
about all your cases, Lieutenant?

23:21.691 --> 23:23.860
-How do you stay sane?
-What did you come here for?

23:24.152 --> 23:27.489
I am defending Richard Brady
in the murder of Mary Hicks.

23:27.948 --> 23:29.866
I want to get the papers on his arrest.

23:32.077 --> 23:33.120
(sighs)

23:33.203 --> 23:35.163
I'll have the desk officer
prepare them for you.

23:35.414 --> 23:36.248
Thanks.

23:37.332 --> 23:39.918
-Are you all right, Henry?
-No, I'm not all right, Ray.

23:43.922 --> 23:46.883
-Tell me everything.
-I think it went well.

23:47.426 --> 23:48.718
Didn't have to leave any blanks?

23:50.429 --> 23:52.305
That's how I felt going
into the interview.

23:52.722 --> 23:54.182
I felt like I was back in high school.

23:54.516 --> 23:55.725
Then everything was all right.

23:55.809 --> 23:57.185
-Clark did everything he--
-Clark?

23:58.145 --> 23:59.729
Deputy Director Galloway.

24:01.314 --> 24:02.149
Hmm.

24:04.151 --> 24:06.278
He did everything he could
to make me feel comfortable.

24:06.778 --> 24:07.654
Did he?

24:11.616 --> 24:14.494
Anyway, the job's
with the antitrust division.

24:15.412 --> 24:17.706
44,000, civil service waived.

24:18.039 --> 24:19.541
(clears throat) Antitrust, your passion.

24:19.624 --> 24:21.501
I can understand
why Clark would come after you.

24:23.170 --> 24:24.337
I'm getting angry, Frank.

24:24.796 --> 24:26.214
Best defense a good offense.

24:27.382 --> 24:29.134
I don't understand
what's happening to you.

24:29.342 --> 24:31.136
I get this way when I've been up all night

24:31.636 --> 24:33.346
phoning a hotel
where you never checked in.

24:33.430 --> 24:34.514
I'd like to know where you were.

24:38.685 --> 24:42.439
I spent the night
in Clark Galloway's very large house.

24:49.196 --> 24:51.364
Look like these punks
got me licked already.

24:52.199 --> 24:54.201
Look like I'm whipped
without even a fight.

24:54.451 --> 24:57.954
You did the right thing sending
your wife and son away, Mr. Hawkins.

24:58.830 --> 25:00.957
They'll be a lot safer
at your sister's place.

25:02.334 --> 25:05.170
Spent my whole life trying
to keep my family together.

25:06.755 --> 25:08.173
Now everything's just falling apart.

25:08.256 --> 25:10.592
Hey, come on, now.
They'll be back before you know it.

25:10.675 --> 25:12.344
Everything's gonna be just fine.

25:13.178 --> 25:14.304
(bells jingling)

25:17.682 --> 25:19.684
-Can I help you, fella?
-You Mr. Hawkins?

25:20.352 --> 25:21.269
That's right.

25:23.230 --> 25:24.689
Bloods say yo!

25:30.445 --> 25:31.321
Come on!

25:31.404 --> 25:33.657
Get him! I got to stay here. Get him!

25:34.199 --> 25:36.743
(lively music playing)

25:46.461 --> 25:48.964
You are busted, you little punk!

25:53.843 --> 25:54.761
Who was with you?

25:55.554 --> 25:58.431
I don't talk to you guys, man. I'm juvie.

25:58.807 --> 26:00.559
Get the juvie officer in here.

26:00.934 --> 26:03.019
Was it Marcus? Tweetybird? Oofus?

26:03.311 --> 26:05.480
Stick it! I'm juvie!

26:06.856 --> 26:09.192
-Who told you to throw the bomb?
-Your mama!

26:09.276 --> 26:11.236
(growls)

26:11.319 --> 26:14.489
You want to hose down Lassie
and give him a dog biscuit?

26:14.573 --> 26:16.074
He don't scare me none.

26:16.157 --> 26:19.369
Lieutenant, you've been repeating
the same questions for 20 minutes now,

26:19.452 --> 26:21.246
and my client
has made a legitimate request

26:21.329 --> 26:24.165
to be attended to
by the juvenile authorities.

26:25.292 --> 26:27.794
I shouldn't have to remind you
he's 14 years old.

26:28.295 --> 26:29.504
Get him down to the Hall, Mick.

26:33.633 --> 26:36.011
You're juvie now, kid,
but you won't always be.

26:38.805 --> 26:40.890
Now the 14-year-olds can handle us, Frank.

26:40.974 --> 26:41.808
The Hawkins bomber?

26:41.891 --> 26:44.102
My advice to Raymond Hawkins
was to send his son away.

26:44.185 --> 26:45.687
That's what I've been good for
since making lieutenant,

26:45.770 --> 26:47.772
telling honest citizens
to get out of town.

26:48.273 --> 26:50.692
Damn it, Frank. We were better off
when we handled the gangs ourselves.

26:50.775 --> 26:52.235
Somebody's gonna get killed
and I can't stop it!

26:52.319 --> 26:54.279
Henry, I don't want anything
to happen to the Hawkins family

26:54.362 --> 26:56.406
any more than you do.
Do what you have to do.

26:58.158 --> 26:59.409
Furillo, I got to talk to you.

26:59.492 --> 27:01.161
We got a problem with Big Broom.

27:01.369 --> 27:03.538
The Civil Liberties Union
and the PD's office

27:03.622 --> 27:04.581
are bringing an injunction

27:04.664 --> 27:06.333
into Judge Grogin's court
to close it down.

27:06.416 --> 27:07.626
Does the chief know about it?

27:07.709 --> 27:10.712
Furillo, what do you think, the sun sets
on Hill Street? Chief knows.

27:10.795 --> 27:14.132
He wants you down there right away.
Grogan's waiting for you.

27:14.215 --> 27:15.675
-Do you have a car?
-Out front.

27:17.844 --> 27:19.888
I need three names: Oofus Martin,

27:19.971 --> 27:22.140
Tweetybird Brown,
Marcus Talmadge. All Blood.

27:22.223 --> 27:23.516
What are the charges?

27:23.933 --> 27:26.436
Uh, arson, conspiracy,

27:26.519 --> 27:28.396
destruction of private property,
whatever sounds good.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.774
Mm. All right, Lieutenant.

27:30.857 --> 27:32.400
Get these guys for me, will you, Phil?

27:35.362 --> 27:38.740
JUDGE: Ah, Captain Furillo.
Glad to have you with us.

27:40.784 --> 27:42.577
If you'd care to approach the bench.

27:46.831 --> 27:48.750
I believe you have a passing familiarity

27:48.833 --> 27:50.585
-with the issue at hand.
-I have.

27:50.960 --> 27:54.214
I assume you have something to say
in defense of Operation Big Broom?

27:54.297 --> 27:59.094
Uh, I would say that, given the existing
circumstances, we did our best.

27:59.177 --> 28:02.305
Your Honor, I take it that by "our best,"

28:02.389 --> 28:06.518
Captain Furillo is referring
to such unmitigated absurdity

28:06.601 --> 28:09.854
as arresting my client three times
in a 48-hour period.

28:10.146 --> 28:12.440
The last time he was picked up,
he was committing

28:12.524 --> 28:15.652
-the illicit act of buying a newspaper.
-If I could just say--

28:15.735 --> 28:17.779
I don't think there's anything more
to say, Captain.

28:18.113 --> 28:20.031
In the last two days, your department

28:20.115 --> 28:23.743
has paraded half the population
of the Hill Street precinct through here

28:23.827 --> 28:26.413
for no better reason
than for me to see their happy faces.

28:26.496 --> 28:28.248
I don't consider it grossly out of line

28:28.331 --> 28:30.750
that Ms. Davenport
and the Civil Liberties Union

28:30.834 --> 28:32.210
has taken exception to that.

28:32.877 --> 28:33.795
(gavel bangs)

28:34.129 --> 28:37.382
I hereby grant an injunction
for the immediate halt of this fiasco

28:38.007 --> 28:39.551
on the grounds that the Fourth Amendment

28:39.634 --> 28:41.845
to the Constitution's
guarantee of protection

28:41.928 --> 28:44.514
from unreasonable searches and seizures

28:44.597 --> 28:48.309
applies to citizens of the Hill
as much as to any other American.

28:48.518 --> 28:51.980
All those persons being held in this room
and elsewhere are free to go.

28:52.063 --> 28:54.983
(applause, cheering)

28:55.066 --> 28:57.569
Your Honor, the district attorney's
office will appeal.

28:58.027 --> 28:59.696
JUDGE: Go ahead. Captain, this injunction

28:59.779 --> 29:02.449
is binding on you
and your entire department.

29:03.074 --> 29:04.868
Let me warn you that if immediate action

29:04.951 --> 29:06.786
is not taken to comply
with its provisions,

29:06.870 --> 29:10.874
I shall hold you and your chief personally
in contempt.

29:11.916 --> 29:14.961
And in conclusion, I would like to say

29:16.463 --> 29:18.715
that this has been a sad affair

29:19.507 --> 29:24.262
for the police and for everybody
connected with Operation Big Broom.

29:24.345 --> 29:26.556
I sincerely hope in the future you behave

29:26.639 --> 29:28.600
in a manner more
responsible to the public,

29:28.683 --> 29:30.477
whose welfare you are supposed to protect.

29:30.560 --> 29:32.854
That's all. Next case.

29:33.396 --> 29:37.400
BAILIFF: Fay Furillo, violation 246B,
State Vehicle Code.

29:37.484 --> 29:40.987
Ralph, let's see if we can move 13029 over
to Judge Hansen's calendar.

29:41.070 --> 29:44.157
-I'm really overbooked.
-FAY: Oh, no, you don't, buster!

29:45.283 --> 29:47.535
Now, I have been sitting back there
for two hours.

29:47.619 --> 29:50.538
You may not return my phone calls,
but you're gonna give me my trial!

29:51.080 --> 29:52.791
Let's have a 10-minute recess.
Clear the courtroom.

29:52.874 --> 29:55.293
(scoffs) Great! I mean,
do you always face up

29:55.376 --> 29:57.796
to all situations like this
by clearing the courtroom?

29:59.672 --> 30:02.300
Okay, Mrs. Furillo. What do you want?

30:02.592 --> 30:04.844
Justice! I went through a red light.

30:04.928 --> 30:06.304
-How do you plea?
-Guilty.

30:06.387 --> 30:08.097
Uh, with an explanation.

30:08.181 --> 30:09.015
Okay. Make it short.

30:09.098 --> 30:12.519
(clears throat) Well, um... Paul...

30:14.187 --> 30:16.272
I realize how difficult it is

30:16.356 --> 30:19.442
for a man to carry on a relationship
with a divorced mother.

30:20.109 --> 30:23.780
I mean, nobody wants to have
a-a ready-made family

30:24.364 --> 30:25.657
with all of the difficulties

30:25.740 --> 30:27.534
and the sacrifices
that come along with it.

30:27.617 --> 30:28.535
It's just that--

30:29.536 --> 30:31.579
well, I think I deserve another chance.

30:31.663 --> 30:34.249
Fay, this is not the time or the place

30:34.332 --> 30:36.668
to have a conversation
about relationships.

30:36.751 --> 30:42.090
If you'd just look at it, you'd see
that I have a lot of good qualities.

30:42.549 --> 30:44.551
I mean, you would see
that I've got a lot to give.

30:44.634 --> 30:46.636
Fay, stop it, damn it!
This is a court of law!

30:46.719 --> 30:48.930
You're not gonna shut me up
with that one, buster!

30:49.305 --> 30:51.933
Now, one way or the other,
we are gonna talk!

30:52.016 --> 30:54.477
-Madam, you are in contempt!
-Madam?

30:55.770 --> 30:56.855
You want to know something?

30:57.397 --> 30:58.773
You're the contemptible one.

30:59.983 --> 31:02.902
You took me to dinner
every Saturday night for a month!

31:03.194 --> 31:05.613
You wrote poems
and put them on the seat of my car.

31:06.197 --> 31:07.365
You called me a pistol.

31:08.449 --> 31:11.870
Now, I want to know what happened to us?

31:12.078 --> 31:13.705
I want to know what's wrong with me.

31:17.917 --> 31:19.460
Nothing's wrong with you, Fay.

31:21.296 --> 31:23.715
The simple truth is that
I've met somebody else.

31:26.926 --> 31:27.844
(sighs)

31:32.056 --> 31:36.144
Some, uh, young tootsie, I suppose, huh?

31:37.103 --> 31:39.105
Well, I mean, it makes sense.

31:39.772 --> 31:42.233
Why waste your time
wearing secondhand polyester

31:42.317 --> 31:45.361
when there's so much
virgin wool around, right?

31:46.863 --> 31:48.031
What's wrong with that?

31:51.284 --> 31:52.410
It's what I want.

31:54.954 --> 31:55.997
I count, too.

31:59.334 --> 32:00.335
(chuckles)

32:02.587 --> 32:06.633
You know, I guess
I never thought of it like that.

32:11.596 --> 32:12.639
Case closed, huh?

32:25.735 --> 32:26.611
Frank!

32:28.613 --> 32:31.866
Frank, right now you are looking
at the safest 200 yards

32:31.950 --> 32:33.284
of asphalt in the country.

32:33.368 --> 32:35.954
Why, we haven't had so much
as a purse snatching--

32:36.037 --> 32:38.081
Shut it down. Send everybody home.

32:39.248 --> 32:40.333
Shut it down?

32:41.542 --> 32:45.380
Big Broom again? On whose authority?

32:45.922 --> 32:48.341
An injunction, state superior court.

32:50.343 --> 32:52.512
-May I see the papers?
-Yes, Howard.

32:52.595 --> 32:55.515
And then you can show me your request
for transfer to another precinct.

32:55.598 --> 32:59.060
Ah. Simple professional curiosity, Frank.

32:59.435 --> 33:02.146
I always stand by my commanding officer.

33:02.689 --> 33:04.190
Just get these people off the bus.

33:07.360 --> 33:08.528
Ballentine!

33:10.780 --> 33:11.656
Sir?

33:13.241 --> 33:17.870
Sound recall. We have been terminated
with extreme prejudice.

33:19.080 --> 33:20.373
The tank, too, sir?

33:22.083 --> 33:23.042
The tank, too.

33:25.545 --> 33:27.880
(siren blaring)

33:30.883 --> 33:32.635
I tell you, man. I can't believe it, Neal.

33:32.719 --> 33:36.472
We got this whole neighborhood
knocking its knees with one lousy tank.

33:36.764 --> 33:40.059
It's nice to be loved, but there's a lot
to be said for cringing respect.

33:40.143 --> 33:42.603
Hey, give 'em time, babe.
They get used to anything.

33:42.687 --> 33:44.355
That's why I got to keep
the old noodle working.

33:44.439 --> 33:47.316
Escalation. One step ahead
of the competition.

33:47.567 --> 33:49.694
Hey, why don't you put up
a spotlight on a building?

33:50.069 --> 33:52.488
You could sweep the whole block
all night like a prison yard.

33:52.989 --> 33:56.743
Hey, Neal! Man, that's sensational!
I know which building!

33:57.744 --> 34:00.496
Hey, J.D., babe, uh,
you were supposed to laugh.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.374
-Mm-hmm.
-J.D., Neal!

34:03.458 --> 34:05.418
They got the tank! They stole the tank!

34:05.501 --> 34:08.588
-What do you mean? Who?
-It's gone, man. It's down the street.

34:08.671 --> 34:11.132
-They rolled over a bus.
-Didn't I tell you to stay with it?

34:11.215 --> 34:14.218
Didn't I tell you this neighborhood
has a lousy rep for tank theft?

34:14.302 --> 34:16.471
I was there. I was inside watching my Sony

34:16.554 --> 34:18.514
when two guys knocked
on the hatch with guns.

34:18.598 --> 34:21.059
They told me to get out
and then they drove it away!

34:21.142 --> 34:22.560
-Oh, man, this is bad.
-(car horn honking)

34:23.644 --> 34:25.271
Washington! LaRue!

34:25.772 --> 34:27.356
Lieutenant says we're moving out!

34:27.440 --> 34:29.067
Operation's been canceled.

34:30.526 --> 34:31.652
-(sighs)
-(chuckles)

34:31.736 --> 34:35.323
Hey, we're lucky, huh, Paulie?
We don't need the tank now.

34:35.406 --> 34:37.742
But what am I gonna do?
How am I gonna get it back?

34:37.825 --> 34:40.828
Hey, hey, look, Paulie. Why don't you come
on back to the station, huh?

34:40.912 --> 34:43.581
We'll help you fill out
a stolen vehicle report. Okay?

34:44.707 --> 34:46.918
What if they rob a bank in my tank?

34:49.921 --> 34:53.257
Get him, sucker!
I ain't no shopping cart! Don't push me!

34:53.341 --> 34:56.094
Ow! Oh, man! Don't step on my foot!

34:56.177 --> 34:58.888
You step on my foot, man,
I'm gonna bust your face!

34:58.971 --> 35:01.099
-Get down there.
-We got 'em, Lieutenant.

35:01.599 --> 35:04.435
-Ow! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, man!
-Hey, what's happening?

35:04.769 --> 35:07.480
-(shouting)
-(clamoring)

35:10.149 --> 35:12.902
(grunting)

35:22.286 --> 35:24.622
-Get him off!
-Get him up! Get him up! Come on!

35:25.373 --> 35:28.000
Get over here! Get over there, man!

35:28.084 --> 35:29.502
(groaning)

35:32.171 --> 35:34.465
(laughing)

35:40.346 --> 35:41.889
What? What's the matter?

35:41.973 --> 35:43.766
What's so funny? What are you laughing at?

35:44.892 --> 35:46.435
What's the matter? What's so funny?

35:46.519 --> 35:50.022
Hey, Jim. Uh, you better put
your top down. Looks like rain, baby.

35:50.106 --> 35:51.149
Shut up!

35:51.732 --> 35:54.360
Hey, bro, you got to freeze on that
'cause you was laughing too, man.

35:54.443 --> 35:58.072
-I said shut up.
-Sorry about that.

35:59.365 --> 36:01.367
(snickering)

36:18.968 --> 36:19.886
Hello, Ray.

36:21.095 --> 36:21.929
Hiya, Phillip.

36:29.979 --> 36:33.316
You know, I, uh--

36:34.400 --> 36:35.318
(chuckles)

36:37.236 --> 36:38.779
I tried a rug once.

36:39.822 --> 36:43.075
I thought I needed it with Cindy.
She hated it. (chuckles)

36:43.159 --> 36:45.995
She said it made me look
less sexy. (chuckling)

36:47.038 --> 36:50.833
I was humiliated. I humiliated myself.

36:50.917 --> 36:53.711
Oh, come on. You know the humor up there.

36:56.797 --> 36:59.217
Look, Ray, you can tell me
to butt off, but, uh...

37:01.427 --> 37:03.054
you want to talk about anything?

37:05.681 --> 37:06.599
Hmm?

37:07.808 --> 37:09.018
Ray, what's going on?

37:12.313 --> 37:13.814
They want young people.

37:14.649 --> 37:16.525
-Who does?
-The department.

37:17.568 --> 37:20.738
Dynamic, youthful. I don't know.

37:22.031 --> 37:23.366
Slim, hairy.

37:25.701 --> 37:26.827
What's funny?

37:27.370 --> 37:28.788
Oh, nothing, nothing.

37:30.164 --> 37:31.916
Everyone knows these things, Phil.

37:33.292 --> 37:36.045
"If you have the image
of a South American despot,

37:36.462 --> 37:38.005
chrome your dome.

37:38.881 --> 37:42.426
But climbing the corporate jungle gym
takes hair and lots of it."

37:42.760 --> 37:45.471
Oh, come on, Ray.
That's only one man's opinion.

37:45.763 --> 37:47.640
You know, a lot of great men
have been bald,

37:48.474 --> 37:52.061
Eisenhower, Genghis Khan, Kojak.

37:52.979 --> 37:55.231
I knew this morning
when I was talking to Frank

37:55.523 --> 37:56.941
what everyone was doing.

37:57.608 --> 38:00.278
They were laughing at me.
I just couldn't admit it.

38:00.361 --> 38:03.447
Ray, everyone up here
respects the hell out of you.

38:03.948 --> 38:06.325
You do a job, and it doesn't go unnoticed.

38:07.159 --> 38:09.161
Everyone expects you'll
be the next captain.

38:09.829 --> 38:12.081
Do they, Phil? Where have you been?

38:12.373 --> 38:15.293
-What are you talking about?
-The new promotions.

38:15.751 --> 38:17.628
Who got promoted, Phil? Who?

38:19.130 --> 38:22.967
Mike North, Wally Peterson, Henry--

38:25.303 --> 38:26.387
Henry Goldblume.

38:27.680 --> 38:29.807
He was always Frank's confidante.

38:30.641 --> 38:31.559
I never was.

38:32.935 --> 38:34.395
Now we're the same rank.

38:35.021 --> 38:37.189
I'm not a petty man, Phil,
and I wish Henry no ill.

38:37.273 --> 38:40.359
Maybe this is something you should discuss
with Henry and the captain.

38:42.653 --> 38:46.615
In the store, you know,
I tried all the different styles.

38:47.158 --> 38:48.743
Finally I found this one.

38:49.452 --> 38:52.038
I looked in the mirror,
this way, that way.

38:53.372 --> 38:55.124
I thought I looked handsome.

38:56.500 --> 38:58.169
Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?

38:58.502 --> 39:00.046
-"Handsome."
-No.

39:00.421 --> 39:06.344
I have this great pride
that I seem to keep stumbling over.

39:07.762 --> 39:09.305
48 years old.

39:12.516 --> 39:15.186
My ambition for 20 years
was to make lieutenant.

39:16.395 --> 39:18.939
I took the test,
passed it four years running.

39:20.649 --> 39:22.777
Three years there weren't any slots.

39:25.029 --> 39:26.614
Fourth year I didn't get picked.

39:30.743 --> 39:31.994
(sighs)

39:32.370 --> 39:35.664
How's this sound, Marcus?
We're talking personal responsibility now.

39:35.998 --> 39:37.792
Anything happens to Raymond Hawkins,

39:39.085 --> 39:41.962
the store gets robbed, glass gets busted
at 3:00 in the morning,

39:42.046 --> 39:45.007
family gets hit by a bus,
I'm coming after you.

39:46.133 --> 39:48.135
And I swear to God, I will find you.

39:48.719 --> 39:51.305
And when I find you, you're gonna wish
you had never been born.

39:51.597 --> 39:53.766
Do you have any little brothers
and sisters at home, Marcus?

39:54.392 --> 39:55.518
Well, let me tell you something.

39:56.602 --> 39:58.813
You better pray Hawkins
doesn't sprain an ankle.

39:59.355 --> 40:01.315
You had better be there with a shovel
making sure there's no ice

40:01.399 --> 40:03.692
on Hawkins's sidewalk
for anybody to slip on.

40:04.318 --> 40:07.947
Say Hawkins has a heart attack, Marcus.
Know what happens then?

40:08.030 --> 40:10.032
I come and I break your face.

40:10.366 --> 40:11.992
Dude's got a heart, that's not my problem.

40:12.076 --> 40:14.662
Yes! It is, Marcus.

40:15.204 --> 40:16.580
Yes, it is.

40:17.039 --> 40:20.334
I told you, we're talking personal
responsibility here.

40:20.918 --> 40:22.628
In fact, something does happen to him,

40:23.462 --> 40:24.713
I hope you didn't do it

40:25.256 --> 40:27.383
because then,
when I put my thumb through your eye,

40:27.550 --> 40:29.051
it'll just be for fun.

40:29.510 --> 40:32.012
-A man can't even do--
-A man can't what?

40:32.596 --> 40:33.472
(grunts)

40:34.682 --> 40:36.350
Let me tell you something more!

40:37.017 --> 40:39.645
As far as I'm concerned, you're garbage
and you're always gonna be.

40:39.854 --> 40:41.564
I cannot rehabilitate you!

40:42.022 --> 40:45.067
And I can't run your entire turf
making sure you behave like angels.

40:45.359 --> 40:49.405
But I can protect this one store,
this one family.

40:49.864 --> 40:52.533
-They're off limits. That I can do.
-(grunts)

40:54.201 --> 40:55.828
That's police brutality, sucker. (pants)

40:55.911 --> 40:57.955
-No, it isn't. This is.
-(grunts)

40:58.956 --> 41:00.166
MARCUS: Get my attorney!

41:00.749 --> 41:01.959
Go ahead. Get your attorney.

41:03.169 --> 41:04.378
You won't be able to prove anything.

41:05.004 --> 41:08.549
You want to know why?
Because I'm a nice guy.

41:09.592 --> 41:11.594
Nobody'll believe
a nice guy like me hit you.

41:12.178 --> 41:13.512
Mick, tell him what a nice guy I am.

41:13.596 --> 41:15.931
Henry Goldblume
is the nicest guy on the Hill.

41:16.015 --> 41:18.225
You stay away from Raymond Hawkins!

41:18.684 --> 41:22.938
You stay away from his place,
his family, his house, his whole life!

41:23.314 --> 41:27.109
He gets to stay there! He's not moving!
Am I understood?

41:30.362 --> 41:35.326
<i>Crimes against persons and property</i>
<i>on this one-time worst block in the city</i>

41:35.409 --> 41:38.829
<i>are down 87 percent compared to the week</i>
<i>preceding Big Broom.</i>

41:39.079 --> 41:41.332
<i>I want to mention simply, in this regard,</i>

41:41.415 --> 41:44.043
<i>the exemplary work of the entire</i>
<i>Hill Street precinct</i>

41:44.460 --> 41:47.838
<i>and to further thank</i>
<i>the Constitutional Liberties Union</i>

41:47.922 --> 41:51.258
<i>and the public defender's office</i>
<i>for alerting us</i>

41:51.342 --> 41:53.344
<i>-to certain constitutional requirements...</i>
-(knocks)

41:53.719 --> 41:55.221
<i>...with which we promptly complied with.</i>

41:55.638 --> 41:57.640
<i>This office remains responsive</i>
<i>to the needs...</i>

41:57.723 --> 41:58.849
Command performance.

42:00.518 --> 42:02.728
<i>-...Uh, except the criminal element.</i>
-(TV switch off)

42:02.811 --> 42:05.856
Did you hear? We saved the Constitution.

42:08.692 --> 42:10.569
Uh, Francis,

42:11.529 --> 42:12.988
aware as I am of the heat you've taken

42:13.072 --> 42:15.366
for your somewhat unpopular
stand in this matter,

42:15.950 --> 42:20.037
I've conducted my own little survey
of incoming complaints.

42:20.120 --> 42:23.332
You see, in the adjoining blocks,
we're up 67 percent.

42:23.415 --> 42:26.043
Precinct-wise, we're right
where we were last week.

42:26.460 --> 42:27.294
Thank you, Phil.

42:29.171 --> 42:30.673
Oh, on an unrelated matter,

42:30.756 --> 42:33.217
I received a phone call
from a grateful pugilist.

42:33.842 --> 42:37.680
It appears Frank Jr., based on some
rudiments I taught him last night,

42:38.097 --> 42:41.392
bloodied young Clarence Davis's nose
this afternoon.

42:41.642 --> 42:45.104
Oh, there's no harm done.
Just a few bruises on both sides.

42:46.021 --> 42:47.565
And they're fast becoming pals.

42:49.275 --> 42:51.819
-I come in a minute?
-Sure. Come on in, Henry.

42:54.572 --> 42:55.406
How'd it go?

42:57.324 --> 43:00.703
(sighs) You'll want to know,
I hit a manacled suspect twice.

43:01.203 --> 43:04.039
-That's against policy.
-I understand that.

43:04.707 --> 43:07.418
I want a complete report on my desk
first thing in the a.m.

43:16.552 --> 43:18.762
(sighs) Frank.

43:21.307 --> 43:24.935
I wasn't gonna let it happen,
not the way it did with Mary Hicks.

43:25.185 --> 43:27.396
-I wasn't gonna just sit--
-I don't have to tell you, Henry.

43:28.022 --> 43:30.983
-We cost ourselves more than we gain.
-Right.

43:42.119 --> 43:43.746
You carry these things.

43:44.830 --> 43:47.916
We used to have these at Doughty's
corner store when I was growing up.

43:48.667 --> 43:49.835
I didn't think they still made 'em.

43:50.169 --> 43:54.048
Wholesalers beat the hell out of me,
4.36 a 12-pack,

43:54.131 --> 43:57.009
Jimbos, those, Swirls over there.

43:57.301 --> 43:59.178
-Still have real chocolate in 'em.
-Hmm.

44:00.054 --> 44:02.556
-Oh, I don't--
-The Jimbos are on the house.

44:08.687 --> 44:12.191
-Thanks.
-Um, what about my family?

44:13.233 --> 44:14.193
Should I bring 'em home?

44:14.610 --> 44:16.028
I don't know. Maybe in a couple of weeks.

44:16.111 --> 44:17.988
(siren blaring)

44:18.072 --> 44:21.367
We may be all right,
but we got to keep our end of it up, okay?

44:21.450 --> 44:24.328
All right. I'll be right here.
I ain't goin' nowhere.

44:24.578 --> 44:25.496
GOLDBLUME: Good.

44:26.705 --> 44:28.040
-Good night.
-Good night.

44:30.542 --> 44:31.960
(bells jingling)

44:33.754 --> 44:35.047
You don't have to do this.

44:35.130 --> 44:38.258
No, I like doing this. Honest.

44:41.345 --> 44:42.971
You got quite a domestic streak, Mick.

44:43.055 --> 44:44.515
-I wouldn't have thought it.
-Well, so do you.

44:44.598 --> 44:47.559
-That meal was wonderful.
-Nah. I overcooked the pasta.

44:47.810 --> 44:49.269
That meal was great.
What, are you kidding?

44:49.353 --> 44:50.729
That clam sauce was fantastic.

44:50.813 --> 44:53.565
Al dente. Pasta's supposed to be al dente.

44:57.194 --> 44:59.196
So, uh, when we're finished up here,
what do you want to do?

44:59.279 --> 45:01.448
You want to go out?
You want to go to a movie?

45:02.616 --> 45:03.867
-Do you?
-I don't know.

45:03.951 --> 45:06.161
I mean, if you want to, we could go out.

45:07.830 --> 45:09.873
Or we could stay here
and put on some music

45:09.957 --> 45:12.418
-or watch TV or something.
-Yeah, okay.

45:13.502 --> 45:16.964
-Unless you'd rather go to a movie.
-No, no. That's fine. We could watch TV.

45:22.177 --> 45:25.222
Look, can we get this over with?

45:27.558 --> 45:28.726
Get what over with?

45:30.894 --> 45:32.938
Oh. (laughs)

45:33.021 --> 45:34.148
Yeah.

45:35.190 --> 45:36.150
Yeah.

45:39.403 --> 45:40.320
Sure.

45:54.001 --> 45:55.753
-That wasn't so bad.
-Yeah.

45:56.170 --> 45:57.671
No, I mean, no, it wasn't.

46:01.800 --> 46:03.302
I really like you, Mick.

46:04.928 --> 46:06.305
I really like you, too.

46:07.806 --> 46:10.434
(thunder rumbling)

46:12.686 --> 46:14.146
I was out of place today.

46:16.774 --> 46:18.901
It just threw me so
when I couldn't get you at the hotel.

46:18.984 --> 46:20.944
My imagination ran away with me.

46:23.155 --> 46:24.656
I'm afraid of losing you, you know.

46:26.450 --> 46:28.619
Do you really think
you could lose me to a job, Frank?

46:28.702 --> 46:32.039
It's not just a job,
it's a whole other way of life.

46:32.372 --> 46:33.791
Joyce, I don't want to--

46:34.249 --> 46:36.418
Frank, they haven't even
offered me the job yet.

46:36.710 --> 46:38.378
Tell the truth,
do you think they're going to?

46:39.713 --> 46:42.466
Yes. I think they probably will.

46:42.549 --> 46:43.884
Do you think that's all
they're gonna offer you?

46:43.967 --> 46:45.302
What's that supposed to mean?

46:45.594 --> 46:46.762
Well, tell me I'm crazy.

46:48.096 --> 46:50.766
Tell me I'm completely irrational
over nothing.

46:51.433 --> 46:54.603
Tell me this guy, this Clark,
doesn't want you.

46:54.937 --> 46:57.856
Tell me all about his house,
about staying at his house

46:57.940 --> 46:59.650
when you had hotel reservations
going down.

46:59.733 --> 47:02.778
I told you, I stayed there
because it was nicer than a hotel room

47:02.861 --> 47:04.112
and he was nice enough to offer.

47:06.031 --> 47:08.033
-How much nicer?
-Don't start again, Frank!

47:08.325 --> 47:10.369
I have to know.
Did you sleep with this guy?

47:12.120 --> 47:14.540
-No, I didn't.
-Did you want to?

47:14.790 --> 47:15.791
What if I did?

47:16.375 --> 47:19.378
Does that give you the right
to treat me like this? It's not like you.

47:19.670 --> 47:21.171
I'm not perfect, counselor.

47:22.589 --> 47:25.926
I have to struggle with some feelings
that may not be the noblest in the world.

47:26.260 --> 47:28.387
And maybe I'm a little jealous.

47:29.054 --> 47:32.432
And I'm also sorry I'm not being
sophisticated enough about this.

47:32.516 --> 47:35.561
But we're not just talking
about a job offer here.

47:35.644 --> 47:37.896
We're talking about
a real challenge to us.

47:37.980 --> 47:40.691
I may be afraid of a lot of things,
but I'm not afraid to look at that.

47:41.567 --> 47:43.527
Is that the truth according to Furillo?

47:43.902 --> 47:45.946
Yes. Tell me I'm wrong.

47:46.363 --> 47:48.073
Frank, I'm just so tired. I--

47:54.288 --> 47:55.831
Do we have to keep discussing this?

47:55.914 --> 47:58.417
I feel like we're going around and around.

47:58.876 --> 48:00.752
-What do you want to do?
-(scoffs)

48:08.260 --> 48:10.345
(sniffles) I want--

48:10.846 --> 48:12.180
I want to get into bed.

48:14.391 --> 48:16.018
I want you to hold me.

48:17.227 --> 48:20.188
(sniffles) I want us to make love.
That's what I want to do.

48:32.492 --> 48:35.454
(closing theme playing)
