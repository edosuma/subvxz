01:12.806 --> 01:17.178
Song: "Faith of the Heart"
It's been a long road,

01:17.178 --> 01:20.633
Getting from there to here,

01:20.633 --> 01:24.343
It's been a long time,

01:24.343 --> 01:28.234
But my time is finally near,

01:28.234 --> 01:32.403
And I will see my dream come alive at last,

01:32.403 --> 01:36.108
I will touch the sky

01:36.108 --> 01:39.788
And they're not gonna hold me down no more,

01:39.788 --> 01:43.112
No they're not gonna change my mind,

01:43.112 --> 01:47.789
Cause I've got faith of the heart,

01:47.789 --> 01:50.784
I'm going where my heart will take me,

01:50.784 --> 01:55.623
I've got faith to believe,

01:55.623 --> 01:58.386
I can do anything,

01:58.386 --> 02:06.014
I've got strength of the soul,
But no one gonna bend or break me,

02:06.014 --> 02:11.855
I can reach, any star,

02:11.855 --> 02:14.046
I've got faith,

02:14.046 --> 02:24.578
I've got faith, faith of the heart.

02:30.889 --> 02:36.446
055 (3x03) Extinction

02:39.500 --> 02:43.065
Come in.

02:43.065 --> 02:45.001
Thanks for seeing me so late.

02:45.001 --> 02:48.466
- You sure I'm not bothering you?
- Not at all.

02:48.466 --> 02:49.760
Georgia peaches.

02:49.760 --> 02:52.325
I picked up a crate
when we were back on Earth.

02:52.325 --> 02:54.137
Chef's been keeping them
in stasis for me.

02:54.137 --> 02:56.484
They're as fresh
as the day they were picked.

02:56.484 --> 02:57.989
Thank you.

02:57.989 --> 03:00.018
Aren't you going to try one?

03:00.018 --> 03:03.292
I don't usually eat this late.

03:03.292 --> 03:07.603
Come on. One bite.

03:07.603 --> 03:10.950
Yeah?

03:20.498 --> 03:25.264
This doesn't make up
for the two sessions you canceled.

03:25.264 --> 03:29.019
Well, maybe you haven't noticed,
but I've been a little busy lately.

03:29.019 --> 03:30.909
It's not like I didn't want to come back.

03:30.909 --> 03:34.265
After our last session,
I slept like a baby.

03:34.265 --> 03:38.791
First time in months.

03:38.791 --> 03:43.229
- So, should I just...?
- Please.

03:49.070 --> 03:50.996
Your shoes, as well.

03:50.996 --> 03:52.077
Shoes?

03:52.077 --> 03:54.850
There are many neural nodes
in the soles of the feet.

03:54.850 --> 03:57.246
Hold on. You never said anything about feet.

03:57.246 --> 03:59.575
Is that a problem?

03:59.575 --> 04:02.213
Well, for one thing,
I haven't had a shower since this morning,

04:02.213 --> 04:06.851
and I know how sensitive that Vulcan nose of yours can be, and...

04:06.851 --> 04:10.347
I'm a little ticklish.

04:10.347 --> 04:12.343
Maybe more than a little.

04:12.343 --> 04:15.079
I'll stop at the first sign of discomfort.

04:15.079 --> 04:17.831
Yeah.

04:30.582 --> 04:34.878
Oh. Your hands are ice cold.

04:40.278 --> 04:42.669
Long, deep breaths.

04:48.085 --> 04:49.778
You sure this is safe?

04:49.778 --> 04:53.966
I mean, has anyone ever tried it
on a human before?

04:53.966 --> 04:56.059
Not to my knowledge.

04:56.059 --> 04:59.972
The risk of paralysis is minimal.

04:59.972 --> 05:04.512
Breathe.

05:07.557 --> 05:11.512
Oh, that's the spot.

05:16.776 --> 05:18.933
- T'Pol.
- It's the Captain.

05:18.933 --> 05:22.218
I'd like you to join me
in the Command Center right away.

05:29.483 --> 05:32.423
- Sorry if I woke you.
- I wasn't asleep.

05:32.423 --> 05:33.460
Look at this.

05:40.190 --> 05:43.111
Another species of Xindi?

05:43.111 --> 05:48.908
According to Phlox, they probably evolved
from some form of arboreal primate.

05:48.908 --> 05:54.710
I managed to piece together some of their starcharts.

05:55.528 --> 05:58.593
It took me half the night to figure out
how they map coordinates,

05:58.593 --> 06:03.005
but I've been able to reconstruct the ship's course
over the past few months.

06:05.373 --> 06:09.094
This is the last planet they visited
before they were attacked by the marauders.

06:09.094 --> 06:10.643
Does it say what they were doing there?

06:10.643 --> 06:12.296
No.

06:12.296 --> 06:14.758
But it's only a day away.

06:16.101 --> 06:18.265
We don't know
if these Xindi were involved

06:18.265 --> 06:21.312
with the ones who attacked Earth.

06:21.312 --> 06:23.591
We don't know they weren't.

06:23.591 --> 06:26.479
Tell Travis to set a course.

06:38.339 --> 06:40.386
The ecosystem is prolific.

06:40.386 --> 06:43.396
There are several million chromophyllic plant species alone.

06:43.396 --> 06:44.391
What about Xindi?

06:44.391 --> 06:48.284
I'm not detecting any humanoid life,
but it'll take several hours

06:48.284 --> 06:51.020
to search all of the land masses.

06:52.337 --> 06:54.140
Captain...

06:54.140 --> 06:59.359
I'm picking up a metallic signature
near the northern end of those equatorial islands.

06:59.359 --> 07:02.101
It looks like a landing craft.

07:02.101 --> 07:03.606
Any bio-scans?

07:03.606 --> 07:06.943
None within a 30 kilometer radius.

07:20.114 --> 07:23.392
Another 13 kilometers.

07:23.392 --> 07:25.157
There's a break in the canopy.

07:25.157 --> 07:26.578
It should be wide enough.

07:26.578 --> 07:28.417
I see it.

07:55.151 --> 07:56.631
Sir.

08:08.843 --> 08:12.133
Judging by the oxidation,
this happened about two weeks ago.

08:12.133 --> 08:14.422
Right about the time the Xindi were here.

08:14.422 --> 08:16.689
It's definitely one of theirs.

08:16.689 --> 08:20.470
I recognize it from the database.

08:20.470 --> 08:22.153
Search the area.

08:22.153 --> 08:24.559
See what else you can find.

08:24.559 --> 08:27.571
Some of their data banks
may still be intact.

08:29.951 --> 08:31.824
Captain!

08:31.824 --> 08:33.914
A body.

08:39.374 --> 08:40.647
It isn't Xindi.

08:40.647 --> 08:43.611
At least not one of the three species
we're familiar with.

08:43.611 --> 08:45.533
Maybe it was one of the other two.

08:45.533 --> 08:48.715
What about him?

08:53.583 --> 08:57.912
The readings are the same.

08:59.648 --> 09:03.017
This whole area's been scorched.

09:04.836 --> 09:07.008
Are you all right?

09:07.008 --> 09:09.391
Yeah, yeah.

09:09.391 --> 09:12.100
I never much cared for the tropics.

09:12.100 --> 09:14.449
Keep looking.

09:43.437 --> 09:45.399
Lieutenant?

10:33.633 --> 10:35.175
Captain!

10:41.096 --> 10:44.594
- T'Pol to Enterprise
- Go ahead

10:44.594 --> 10:46.171
Send a security team to the surface.

10:46.171 --> 10:47.866
We're being altered by some kind of...

10:47.866 --> 10:50.749
Jahz ya brahk...

10:50.749 --> 10:52.710
Sub-Commander?

11:01.107 --> 11:04.299
Jahz ya seetayla!

11:04.299 --> 11:05.712
Stay back.

11:05.712 --> 11:07.400
Jahz ya brahk!

11:57.988 --> 12:04.129
Zihn'tah. Key'znaht.

12:05.955 --> 12:15.711
- Hees tellum ta'key.
- Mina sa'aahl udukay!

12:21.042 --> 12:25.092
Rageen so-lok?

12:27.080 --> 12:28.272
Captain...

12:28.272 --> 12:30.964
So-lok?!

12:35.167 --> 12:37.074
Untie me.

12:37.988 --> 12:40.280
Let me go.

12:47.832 --> 12:50.604
Haiin tera koomptah!

13:06.302 --> 13:07.895
Thank you.

13:21.142 --> 13:24.829
We have to get back to Enterprise.

13:26.265 --> 13:28.576
Enterprise.

13:34.911 --> 13:38.801
Rageen so-lok?

13:45.017 --> 13:46.876
May I have that?

13:46.876 --> 13:49.127
The device-- may I have that?

13:49.127 --> 13:55.835
Ashtoor yinquassa.
Siqua linasah.

13:59.512 --> 14:07.569
Yinquass'qua.
Yinquass'qua!

14:34.386 --> 14:38.768
This may help us understand each other.

14:39.894 --> 14:42.692
You're going to have to talk.

14:42.692 --> 14:48.561
Talk.

14:48.561 --> 14:53.267
You need to talk.

15:05.208 --> 15:07.113
That's a Vulcan bio-sign.

15:07.113 --> 15:08.415
I'm certain of it.

15:08.415 --> 15:09.598
But these aren't human.

15:09.598 --> 15:11.252
Definitely not.

15:11.252 --> 15:14.391
Then where's the rest of our team?

15:14.391 --> 15:16.797
The only reason I don't have a search party down there right now

15:16.797 --> 15:18.842
is because you needed more time to analyze the data.

15:18.842 --> 15:21.629
Now, unless you can give me
a damn good reason to wait around...

15:21.629 --> 15:24.970
When T'Pol called the ship,
she said something was happening to them.

15:24.970 --> 15:26.708
She said they were being altered.

15:26.708 --> 15:29.322
It's possible she was speaking literally.

15:29.322 --> 15:32.858
Something on the planet
may have transformed them physiologically.

15:32.858 --> 15:36.287
You're saying these alien bio-signs could be our people?

15:36.287 --> 15:37.687
From what we've seen of the Expanse,

15:37.687 --> 15:40.507
it's a possibility we have to consider.

15:40.507 --> 15:44.713
The laws of biochemistry on this world
may be just as unpredictable as the laws of physics.

15:44.713 --> 15:46.796
Whoever they are,
they're not staying put.

15:46.796 --> 15:50.014
They're heading due east of the landing site.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.458
Prep Shuttlepod Two.

15:52.458 --> 15:53.666
Aye, sir.

15:53.666 --> 15:55.678
I'd like a little more time to study these readings.

15:55.678 --> 15:57.582
We'll use EV suits with bio-hazard protocols.

15:57.582 --> 15:59.734
Have a decon chamber ready when we get back.

16:04.812 --> 16:07.151
Enterprise...?

16:07.151 --> 16:09.808
Yes, it's your ship.

16:09.808 --> 16:11.768
You're the captain.

16:11.768 --> 16:14.116
We don't have time for this.

16:14.116 --> 16:17.393
We have to find Urquat.

16:17.393 --> 16:19.333
It's all that matters now.

16:19.333 --> 16:21.414
Urquat?

16:21.414 --> 16:23.762
We have to keep looking.

16:23.762 --> 16:25.927
It's somewhere close.

16:25.927 --> 16:28.154
Why are you talking to her?

16:28.154 --> 16:30.370
She's trying to delay us.

16:30.370 --> 16:34.254
Our people are there!

16:37.900 --> 16:42.887
They can help us,
tell us what happened,

16:42.887 --> 16:45.845
why we can't remember.

16:45.845 --> 16:48.946
Captain. That device.

16:48.946 --> 16:51.361
I can use it to call Enterprise.

16:51.361 --> 16:52.749
You have a doctor on board.

16:52.749 --> 16:54.819
He can prove to you
what I'm saying is true.

16:54.819 --> 16:56.390
Don't trust her.

16:56.390 --> 16:59.987
She's not one of us.

17:00.957 --> 17:05.040
We don't know
what she is.

17:18.669 --> 17:21.809
Urquat.

17:21.809 --> 17:27.357
You said we need
to find Urquat.

17:28.856 --> 17:32.384
We should keep searching.

17:44.114 --> 17:46.065
It can't be far.

19:22.667 --> 19:25.260
No, thank you.

19:28.979 --> 19:31.721
I'm not hungry.

20:03.066 --> 20:06.337
They're about three
kilometers east of us.

20:06.337 --> 20:09.675
We don't have too many options for a landing site.

20:09.675 --> 20:12.514
Hope you boys are up for a little walk.

20:17.897 --> 20:20.529
It's the shuttlepod from Enterprise.

20:20.529 --> 20:21.772
They won't hurt you.

20:21.772 --> 20:23.565
Let me talk to them.

20:40.820 --> 20:43.299
Keep your weapons on stun.

20:43.299 --> 20:47.003
Circle around.

21:39.441 --> 21:41.551
Chang?

21:49.883 --> 21:51.461
Captain!

21:52.581 --> 21:53.874
Wait!

21:53.874 --> 21:56.548
Don't you recognize him?

22:11.086 --> 22:12.484
Take Lieutenant Reed back to Sick Bay.

22:12.484 --> 22:13.291
What about you?

22:13.291 --> 22:15.717
- I'm staying with them.
- Sub-Commander!

22:35.125 --> 22:37.752
He didn't even recognize me.

22:37.752 --> 22:39.025
Don't be offended.

22:39.025 --> 22:42.357
In his current condition,
I doubt he'd recognize any of us.

22:42.357 --> 22:44.048
Any idea what caused this?

22:44.048 --> 22:45.824
A mutagenic virus.

22:45.824 --> 22:48.503
His blood was swarming with them.

22:53.706 --> 22:56.874
It was apparently designed to rewrite the DNA of its host.

22:56.874 --> 23:00.349
To transform any humanoid it infects into another species.

23:00.349 --> 23:02.034
Why did it have so little effect on T'Pol?

23:02.034 --> 23:03.190
Vulcan K cells.

23:03.190 --> 23:05.016
They seem to neutralize the pathogen.

23:05.016 --> 23:07.934
I have been synthesizing an antivirus using T'Pol's genetic profile,

23:07.934 --> 23:11.064
but I'm going to need an active sample of her DNA to complete it.

23:11.064 --> 23:13.223
We need to get her back to the ship as soon as possible.

23:13.223 --> 23:14.666
I'm doing my best.

23:14.666 --> 23:17.356
Bridge to Commander Tucker.

23:19.357 --> 23:20.492
Go ahead.

23:20.492 --> 23:22.457
Two ships just dropped out of warp.

23:22.457 --> 23:24.870
They're on an intercept course.

23:34.754 --> 23:36.290
They're hailing us.

23:36.290 --> 23:38.274
Open a channel.

23:38.274 --> 23:40.448
Your ship is in restricted space.

23:40.448 --> 23:41.891
Sorry.

23:41.891 --> 23:43.567
It wasn't very well marked.

23:43.567 --> 23:48.115
Our scans indicate that one of the people on your ship
has been infected with a dangerous virus.

23:48.115 --> 23:49.781
We're aware of that.

23:49.781 --> 23:51.366
Is there anything you can tell us about...?

23:51.366 --> 23:53.750
Your vessel's under quarantine.

23:53.750 --> 23:56.251
Prepare to be boarded.

23:59.445 --> 24:01.549
No one's coming aboard
unless I say so.

24:01.549 --> 24:05.626
The infected organism must be eradicated
before the virus can spread.

24:05.626 --> 24:09.016
That "infected organism" is a member of my crew.

24:09.016 --> 24:11.809
Does he still look like one of your crew?

24:11.809 --> 24:15.276
Does he recognize you,
or even speak your language anymore?

24:15.276 --> 24:17.865
We've been studying the mutagen for 60 years.

24:17.865 --> 24:20.880
The only course of action is to neutralize the outbreak.

24:20.880 --> 24:22.724
There isn't any outbreak.

24:22.724 --> 24:25.061
Lieutenant Reed is in medical isolation.

24:25.061 --> 24:28.624
We won't allow your vessel to leave orbit
with the contagion aboard.

24:28.624 --> 24:32.564
Look, we've only been dealing
with this virus for one day, so forgive me

24:32.564 --> 24:36.982
if I don't take your word for it
that the only option is to neutralize our Tactical Officer.

24:36.982 --> 24:40.826
You want to come over
to discuss the situation, fine,

24:40.826 --> 24:43.383
but if you try to force your way onto this ship,

24:43.383 --> 24:46.671
you're going to have one hell
of a fight on your hands.

26:00.232 --> 26:05.823
How long... was I asleep?

26:05.823 --> 26:08.497
Only for a few minutes.

26:08.497 --> 26:13.336
I saw it... in my dream.

26:13.336 --> 26:16.008
I was there.

26:16.008 --> 26:17.327
Urquat?

26:17.327 --> 26:19.797
Our city.

26:19.797 --> 26:22.597
There are no cities on this planet.

26:22.597 --> 26:25.817
You're wrong.

26:25.817 --> 26:28.267
It's below the surface.

26:28.267 --> 26:35.527
Tell me... what was it like?

26:35.527 --> 26:42.203
It was filled with thousands of Loque'eque...

26:42.203 --> 26:49.235
waiting... for us.

26:49.235 --> 26:52.915
Your home is a planet called Earth.

26:52.915 --> 26:56.223
The people there are waiting for you.

26:56.223 --> 27:00.876
You're on a mission to save them.

27:00.876 --> 27:03.267
Urquat's my home.

27:03.267 --> 27:09.236
When we get there,
you'll understand; wait.

27:09.236 --> 27:12.698
We've rested long enough.

27:13.535 --> 27:14.808
The decon chamber is sealed.

27:14.808 --> 27:16.659
I assure you there's no danger.

27:16.659 --> 27:21.119
You wouldn't be so confident
if you knew how easily this virus can spread.

27:21.119 --> 27:24.583
It infected tens of millions of people on my world.

27:24.583 --> 27:26.590
They all had to be destroyed.

27:26.590 --> 27:27.864
Destroyed?

27:27.864 --> 27:32.714
The virus would have transformed our entire population within weeks.

27:32.714 --> 27:34.877
Where did it come from?

27:34.877 --> 27:37.790
It was engineered by
the inhabitants of this planet.

27:37.790 --> 27:40.508
A race called the Loque'eque.

27:40.508 --> 27:43.469
Something decimated their species centuries ago,

27:43.469 --> 27:45.812
and they lost the ability to reproduce,

27:45.812 --> 27:49.354
so they created this virus to transform other species into their own.

27:49.354 --> 27:52.467
It was the only way to save themselves from extinction.

27:52.467 --> 27:53.934
Ingenious.

27:53.934 --> 27:58.072
But why didn't they program the virus to stop replicating once their population was replenished?

27:58.072 --> 28:01.084
We've been trying to answer that question for a long time.

28:01.084 --> 28:04.876
Why is he so eager to get back to a place called Urquat?

28:04.876 --> 28:10.822
The mutagen encodes the victims with an overpowering instinct to return to their home city, Urquat.

28:10.822 --> 28:15.094
That's why we can't allow even a single infected organism to leave this planet.

28:15.094 --> 28:19.851
They could spread the contagion to other systems and anyone who became infected would be drawn back here.

28:19.851 --> 28:26.164
We can't risk another epidemic.

28:26.164 --> 28:27.322
Yes?

28:27.322 --> 28:31.257
We've detected three more infected organisms on the surface.

28:31.257 --> 28:34.098
Prepare a containment team.

28:34.098 --> 28:34.951
More of your crewmen.

28:34.951 --> 28:37.146
One of them has an immunity to the virus.

28:37.146 --> 28:40.351
If I could have access to some of your research,
perhaps we could work together to...

28:40.351 --> 28:43.579
We'll find these people and examine them.

28:43.579 --> 28:45.940
If there's anything to report,
we'll let you know.

28:45.940 --> 28:48.697
I'd prefer to have Dr. Phlox examine them.

28:48.697 --> 28:51.513
What you prefer doesn't matter.

28:51.513 --> 28:54.008
I'm under orders to contain this outbreak.

28:54.008 --> 29:00.183
If you attempt to interfere,
I'm authorized to use any force necessary.

29:04.080 --> 29:06.171
Take me back to the airlock.

29:15.636 --> 29:17.846
If I don't complete the antivirus within the next two hours,

29:17.846 --> 29:18.883
it will be too late.

29:18.883 --> 29:22.512
There won't be enough
of their original genome left to resequence.

29:22.512 --> 29:26.522
We can't launch a shuttlepod,
they'd detect it.

29:26.522 --> 29:28.651
Do you think T'Pol's contagious?

29:28.651 --> 29:30.820
Most likely.

29:30.820 --> 29:32.958
That rules out the transporter.

29:32.958 --> 29:34.572
She'd infect the entire crew.

29:34.572 --> 29:36.125
Whatever you do, Commander, do it quickly.

29:36.125 --> 29:39.111
I need that DNA sample.

29:42.042 --> 29:43.849
Be right back.

30:08.247 --> 30:10.697
- Bridge to Commander Tucker
- Go ahead

30:10.697 --> 30:12.665
One of those ships just launched a shuttle, sir.

30:12.665 --> 30:14.283
It's heading toward the surface.

30:14.283 --> 30:15.783
Keep an eye on them!

30:18.936 --> 30:22.209
It isn't far now.

30:29.425 --> 30:33.933
The passage was here in my dream.

30:33.933 --> 30:36.384
Help me.

31:36.622 --> 31:38.510
They're waiting for us

31:38.510 --> 31:45.205
I saw it... so clearly.

31:45.205 --> 31:51.953
There... was... a fountain... there.

31:51.953 --> 32:02.222
And gardens... up there... floating.

32:02.222 --> 32:07.832
And there were... people.

32:07.832 --> 32:11.562
Thousands of people.

32:11.562 --> 32:13.673
Come back to Enterprise.

32:13.673 --> 32:16.009
We'll help you find out
what happened to your city.

32:16.009 --> 32:18.129
No, no.

32:18.129 --> 32:19.540
We're not leaving.

32:19.540 --> 32:21.263
This is our home.

32:21.263 --> 32:24.716
Home... ho...

32:30.543 --> 32:33.282
Look around.

32:33.282 --> 32:35.985
These ruins are ancient.

32:35.985 --> 32:41.186
No one has lived here
for a very long time.

32:42.356 --> 32:44.222
What about this?

32:44.222 --> 32:50.227
This body isn't ancient.

32:52.354 --> 32:55.369
Someone killed them.

32:55.369 --> 32:59.027
Why?

32:59.027 --> 33:02.534
Who would do this?

33:12.452 --> 33:15.974
Your people.

33:15.974 --> 33:17.830
No.

33:17.830 --> 33:19.740
Then who?

33:19.740 --> 33:21.727
I don't know,
but if we go to Enterprise

33:21.727 --> 33:23.400
we can try to find out.

33:23.400 --> 33:25.730
I don't belong on Enterprise!

33:25.730 --> 33:28.239
I belong here.

33:28.239 --> 33:30.870
Someone's coming.

33:30.870 --> 33:34.534
More of your humans?

33:34.534 --> 33:37.315
I don't think so.

33:41.636 --> 33:43.921
We're not safe here.

33:43.921 --> 33:46.427
Come, we must go.

33:46.427 --> 33:48.886
Come, we must go.

34:01.174 --> 34:02.528
We found them.

34:02.528 --> 34:05.809
Take the Vulcan, then destroy the others.

34:05.809 --> 34:07.328
Understood.

34:09.764 --> 34:11.592
Who are they?

34:11.592 --> 34:13.848
I don't know.

34:42.755 --> 34:44.384
You destroyed my city!

34:44.384 --> 34:45.473
Killed my people!

34:56.228 --> 34:57.534
Captain!

34:57.534 --> 35:00.107
We have to get to the surface.

35:25.841 --> 35:27.405
This way.

36:00.708 --> 36:02.285
Lower your weapon and move away.

36:02.285 --> 36:04.682
You won't be harmed.

36:05.295 --> 36:07.834
I said move away!

36:29.146 --> 36:30.951
You all right?

36:32.332 --> 36:34.444
You said you'd never use the transporter again.

36:34.444 --> 36:36.411
Believe me, I wish I'd had a choice.

36:36.411 --> 36:37.730
There are more of them in orbit.

36:37.730 --> 36:41.643
You better get back to the shuttlepod
before they realize anything's wrong.

36:43.585 --> 36:48.349
Captain... you can't stay here.

36:48.349 --> 36:51.166
You'll be safe on Enterprise.

37:09.760 --> 37:11.244
It's Commander Tucker.

37:11.244 --> 37:13.036
Put him through.

37:13.036 --> 37:14.909
Go ahead, sir.

37:14.909 --> 37:16.487
We're docking, Travis.

37:16.487 --> 37:18.621
Tell Phlox to stand by in decon.

37:18.621 --> 37:20.882
Go to warp four as soon as we're in.

37:20.882 --> 37:22.464
Understood.

37:41.486 --> 37:43.071
Report.

37:43.071 --> 37:44.149
They're in pursuit.

37:44.149 --> 37:46.064
2,000 kilometers and closing.

37:46.064 --> 37:47.309
Try to stay ahead of them.

37:47.309 --> 37:49.290
Stand by weapons.

37:55.523 --> 37:56.686
They're hailing us.

37:56.686 --> 37:57.871
Don't respond.

37:57.871 --> 37:59.412
Hold your course.

38:01.540 --> 38:03.425
900 kilometers.

38:03.425 --> 38:05.038
They're charging weapons.

38:05.038 --> 38:07.064
Seven hundred.

38:07.966 --> 38:10.218
Full power to aft hull plating!

38:20.081 --> 38:23.371
Hull plating's down to 40%.

38:23.371 --> 38:25.479
We're being hailed again.

38:27.775 --> 38:29.732
Drop out of warp.

38:29.732 --> 38:34.760
Look... we both want the same thing,
a cure for this virus, right?

38:34.760 --> 38:37.996
Our doctor thinks he's found one,
but he needs a little more time to...

38:37.996 --> 38:39.661
I won't warn you again, Commander.

38:39.661 --> 38:41.243
We're going to contain this outbreak

38:41.243 --> 38:43.954
whether you cooperate or not.

38:47.382 --> 38:49.587
Why are you firing at my ship?

38:49.587 --> 38:51.887
There are three infected people on board.

38:51.887 --> 38:54.445
We won't allow you
to leave this system.

38:54.445 --> 38:56.765
This is Captain Archer and Ensign Sato.

38:56.765 --> 38:59.755
They are the people you nearly
incinerated on that planet.

38:59.755 --> 39:04.241
As you can see, they're responding quite well
to the antivirus I synthesized.

39:04.241 --> 39:06.227
That's... not possible.

39:06.227 --> 39:07.391
Run scans.

39:07.391 --> 39:09.636
See for yourself.

39:10.665 --> 39:14.248
Like I said, he just needed a little more time.

39:15.361 --> 39:18.047
I'm sure we'd be happy to share antivirus with you,

39:18.047 --> 39:21.265
but that'll be impossible
if you destroy our ship.

39:24.129 --> 39:26.074
Captain's Starlog, supplemental.

39:26.074 --> 39:29.584
We've given Phlox's serum to the captain of the containment vessel.

39:29.584 --> 39:34.048
With any luck, he'll be able to use it
to prevent future outbreaks.

39:34.048 --> 39:39.522
As for Malcolm, Hoshi and me,
it may be a few days before we feel fully human again.

39:40.462 --> 39:42.719
This should help with the headaches.

39:42.719 --> 39:45.103
Have you got anything for my stomach?

39:45.103 --> 39:47.777
Chef's food isn't sitting too well.

39:47.777 --> 39:52.313
Until your digestive tract is fully restored,
you may want to avoid the mess hall.

39:52.313 --> 39:54.692
What do you suggest I eat?

39:54.692 --> 39:58.580
You're welcome to some of the moth larvae I feed to my Pyrithian bat.

40:03.409 --> 40:06.041
How you feeling, Lieutenant?

40:06.041 --> 40:08.080
Eh, not bad, sir.

40:08.080 --> 40:10.553
How about yourself?

40:10.553 --> 40:15.719
Getting there. Hoshi and T'Pol are going to take the day off.

40:15.719 --> 40:18.281
You might want to do the same.

40:18.281 --> 40:20.559
Thank you, Captain.

40:20.559 --> 40:23.390
I could use a little rest.

40:27.815 --> 40:30.395
You wanted to see me?

40:30.395 --> 40:33.367
This is the last of the mutagenic virus.

40:33.367 --> 40:36.628
I assume you want me to destroy it.

40:36.628 --> 40:37.964
No.

40:37.964 --> 40:41.819
Captain, you experienced first-hand
what this pathogen can do.

40:41.819 --> 40:47.363
Those containment patrols aren't going to stop
until they've wiped out every trace of it.

40:47.363 --> 40:52.419
Now that they have your antivirus,
they'll most likely figure out a way to succeed.

40:52.419 --> 40:56.771
Considering the alternatives,
that would be best.

41:03.511 --> 41:13.494
This was created... as a final effort to preserve a civilization, a people.

41:13.494 --> 41:21.045
That species we became... they cease to exist the moment this virus is gone.

41:21.045 --> 41:24.249
Captain...

41:24.249 --> 41:29.237
We came out here to stop the Xindi from destroying humanity.

41:29.237 --> 41:37.266
I'll be damned if I'm going to have a hand in destroying another race in the process.

41:37.782 --> 41:42.183
Put it on ice, Doc.
In stasis, whatever.

41:42.183 --> 41:44.262
Understood?
