00:01.664 --> 00:03.437
Previously on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend

00:03.461 --> 00:05.382
- Hey, Heath.
- Name's Heather.

00:05.406 --> 00:07.078
I'm a student. I'm a student.

00:07.102 --> 00:08.195
I'm a student?

00:08.219 --> 00:10.373
So tell me some other
stuff about my future.

00:10.398 --> 00:11.865
The wedding is in two weeks!

00:11.867 --> 00:13.133
I just wanted to drop off

00:13.135 --> 00:14.368
a little wedding present for you.

00:14.370 --> 00:15.803
Does this have anything to do with

00:15.805 --> 00:17.671
Robert and Harvard Law School?

00:17.695 --> 00:20.068
- Who's Robert?
- Right, so Robert was my dog,

00:20.093 --> 00:21.773
and he just left me one day.

00:21.798 --> 00:24.940
- Robert, you know you can't leave me.
- It's over.

00:24.965 --> 00:27.633
Josh is leaving me to become

00:27.635 --> 00:29.268
- a priest.
- Sue him.

00:29.270 --> 00:31.336
Breach of contract, financial damages.

00:31.523 --> 00:33.772
Why doesn't anybody
understand what I really want?

00:33.774 --> 00:34.973
Well, what do you really want?

00:34.975 --> 00:36.875
I want him to face what he did to me.

00:36.877 --> 00:40.179
Do you know what this person did to me?

00:40.181 --> 00:42.815
You're gonna know everything
he did to me and every terrible

00:42.817 --> 00:45.751
thing he made me do. Oh, my
God, I told him everything.

00:47.544 --> 00:50.412
Oh, my God, I told him everything.

00:52.659 --> 00:54.851
I told him everything.

00:55.241 --> 00:58.133
Oh, my God, I told him everything.
I told him everything.

00:58.532 --> 01:00.098
I told him everything.

01:00.100 --> 01:01.749
Stop saying that.

01:01.774 --> 01:03.535
And take off that stupid dress.

01:03.537 --> 01:04.726
It's embarrassing.

01:04.751 --> 01:07.806
- Ugh. What are you doing here?
- You have no one to talk to.

01:07.808 --> 01:09.875
Your anxiety is so palpable,

01:09.877 --> 01:13.645
it's manifested in human
form as me, who is you.

01:13.647 --> 01:15.781
- I guess that makes sense.
- You told Josh

01:15.953 --> 01:18.568
all the shady, lying crap that you did,

01:18.593 --> 01:20.586
and you did some crazy things, bro.

01:20.588 --> 01:22.867
Even I'm surprised, and I'm you.

01:22.892 --> 01:25.920
Tracking his car,
breaking into his home,

01:25.945 --> 01:28.994
spying on him while he
had sex with other girls?

01:28.996 --> 01:30.829
I mean, who does that stuff?!

01:30.831 --> 01:34.199
And then you confessed
it all to him. So stupid.

01:34.201 --> 01:36.484
So now he knows the truth about you.

01:36.509 --> 01:38.796
No. Wait. He doesn't
know the whole truth.

01:38.973 --> 01:40.606
Uh-uh. He thinks Robert's a dog.

01:40.608 --> 01:42.007
Yeah, everyone thinks that.

01:42.009 --> 01:44.343
Yeah, and that's your only saving grace,

01:44.345 --> 01:45.777
'cause if people found out

01:45.779 --> 01:48.780
that Robert was actually a
professor that you stalked,

01:48.782 --> 01:51.116
and then you tried to
burn down his apartment,

01:51.118 --> 01:53.085
which got you put into a loony bin...

01:53.087 --> 01:54.843
Hey, "loony" is a derogatory term.

01:54.868 --> 01:56.584
Loony! Loony! Loony!

01:56.609 --> 01:59.803
Ugh. The things that you
told Josh are unforgivable,

01:59.828 --> 02:01.584
and once he tells your friends,

02:01.609 --> 02:04.506
oh, they are all gonna be done with you.

02:04.531 --> 02:05.808
He's not gonna tell anyone.

02:05.833 --> 02:08.533
I mean, he's not even in West Covina.
He's up in priest school.

02:08.536 --> 02:10.869
- Pre-school?
- Priest school.

02:10.871 --> 02:12.538
So, yeah. Why would he tell anyone?

02:12.563 --> 02:16.198
Uh, maybe because
you're about to sue him?

02:16.483 --> 02:19.536
Yeah, you're gonna literally
force him to defend himself.

02:19.561 --> 02:22.694
You handed him his defense
with that rant in the church!

02:22.850 --> 02:24.149
Oh, my God, you're right.

02:24.151 --> 02:25.874
Oh, my God, I didn't even think of that!

02:25.899 --> 02:27.202
Of course you didn't.

02:27.227 --> 02:29.319
Now, you need to call off that case,

02:29.344 --> 02:32.609
you stalking, obsessive,
psycho, crazy...

02:32.634 --> 02:34.437
I'm not crazy, I'm not
crazy, I'm not crazy.

03:24.406 --> 03:26.843
What?

03:26.868 --> 03:28.726
Well, you've been
standing there all morning.

03:28.751 --> 03:31.796
And I thought maybe you threw your
back out, and I have a massager.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.282
Actually, I have two... one, two.

03:34.284 --> 03:35.827
So, turn around, let me get on in there.

03:35.852 --> 03:37.552
- Get out of here.
- Oh. Okay.

03:39.742 --> 03:41.041
Why are you anxious about this?

03:41.043 --> 03:43.569
There's no need to be anxious.
It's easy. Just call off the case.

03:43.594 --> 03:45.227
Let sleeping Chans lie. It's fine.

03:45.252 --> 03:47.648
Also, you need to keep your
internal monologue internal

03:47.650 --> 03:49.082
starting now.

03:49.084 --> 03:51.648
- Hey, Rebecca. Wait.
- What? What? What?

03:51.673 --> 03:53.046
Um...

03:53.071 --> 03:55.294
- Well, I, uh...
- Hmm?

03:55.319 --> 03:57.324
I was, I was thinking about, um,

03:57.326 --> 03:58.851
well, about the other night.

03:59.648 --> 04:01.929
When I tried to kill Josh's grandfather,

04:01.931 --> 04:03.330
that was weird.

04:03.332 --> 04:06.155
Right? But the other thing
that happened between us...

04:06.616 --> 04:09.803
That wasn't weird, that
was... that was cool, right?

04:09.805 --> 04:13.265
Are you asking me if
us having sex was cool?

04:13.296 --> 04:15.375
No, I wouldn't do that.

04:15.377 --> 04:17.577
That would be weird. I
wouldn't do that. That's...

04:17.579 --> 04:19.980
It's just that ever since
the, you know, lovemaking,

04:19.982 --> 04:21.718
the sex-making, um...

04:21.743 --> 04:23.413
... I haven't heard from you.

04:23.999 --> 04:26.687
Yeah. Okay, so, um,
sorry. I've just been

04:26.689 --> 04:28.655
a little distracted, and I
actually really can't talk now.

04:28.657 --> 04:30.257
Oh, there's Paula. I got to go. Bye.

04:30.259 --> 04:31.592
Hey, hey, hey, Paula.

04:31.594 --> 04:33.961
Um, I need to talk
to you about the case.

04:33.963 --> 04:36.694
Ooh! Yes. No, I need
to talk to you, too.

04:36.719 --> 04:40.020
Um, okay, so you know our
favorite Internet thing?

04:40.632 --> 04:42.869
Celebrities with cellulite that
look like kittens with yarn?

04:42.871 --> 04:45.124
I forgot about that.
No, our favorite blog.

04:45.484 --> 04:46.540
The Corset.

04:46.890 --> 04:48.909
- Feminist news, nail art and more?
- Yes!

04:48.911 --> 04:51.244
I tweeted at them, told
them a little about the case,

04:51.246 --> 04:53.327
just enough to wet their whistle, and...

04:54.241 --> 04:55.682
they love it!

04:56.538 --> 04:58.852
They love it. They want to do
a piece on how the two of us

04:58.854 --> 05:02.789
are using our legal acumen to
defeat the patriarchy, AKA Josh.

05:02.791 --> 05:05.258
Me and you, two ladies of the law,

05:05.260 --> 05:07.540
just standing shoulder to shoulder

05:07.565 --> 05:09.363
with the scales of
justice and no shirt on.

05:09.365 --> 05:10.664
Paula, we need to drop the case.

05:10.666 --> 05:13.133
What? Why would we... ?

05:13.775 --> 05:15.111
What?

05:18.607 --> 05:22.976
So, listen, I appreciate
how hard you've been working.

05:22.978 --> 05:24.401
I-I really do.

05:24.426 --> 05:27.848
But I worry that our
case isn't strong enough.

05:29.217 --> 05:30.329
What do you mean?

05:30.354 --> 05:32.052
Okay, so you've taken the lead on this,

05:32.054 --> 05:34.755
which I so, so, so appreciate,

05:34.757 --> 05:36.890
but I was looking over
some of the filings

05:36.892 --> 05:38.425
last night... your filings...

05:38.427 --> 05:40.427
- Yeah...
- and I don't think

05:40.429 --> 05:42.557
our legal bona fides are
where they need to be.

05:43.509 --> 05:46.209
It's a cute case,
like, for a law student.

05:46.234 --> 05:48.101
It's-it's-it's cute, and, like,

05:48.103 --> 05:49.569
I see the effort behind it,

05:49.571 --> 05:52.005
but I-I'm seeing the effort... too much.

05:52.768 --> 05:54.455
Oh, my God.

05:54.480 --> 05:57.054
From one lawyer to another,

05:57.079 --> 05:58.712
someday, future, hopeful lawyer,

05:58.714 --> 06:00.494
I want to let you know...

06:00.519 --> 06:02.883
It's like if you had spinach
in your teeth, I'd tell you,

06:02.885 --> 06:04.284
and right now, I want to let you know

06:04.286 --> 06:05.952
on a professional level,
we have spinach in our case.

06:05.954 --> 06:09.289
I-I-I thought it was
good stuff, and I was wrong,

06:09.291 --> 06:12.358
and I'm super embarrassed,
and I feel really stupid.

06:12.383 --> 06:14.528
- No, no, no. No, don't feel stupid.
Don't feel stupid. - No, no, no. No.

06:14.530 --> 06:15.729
Look, you're in school. You're learning.

06:15.731 --> 06:17.297
- It's fine.
- That's what school is for.

06:17.299 --> 06:20.434
Thank you, because I was about to file
all those documents. Oh, well, that...

06:20.436 --> 06:22.169
- Which I will not do.
- Well, that would have been embarrassing.

06:22.171 --> 06:23.637
- That would have been horrible.
- That would have been embarrassing.

06:23.639 --> 06:25.238
And I will call the editor

06:25.240 --> 06:28.141
of The Corset, obviously, and tell them

06:28.143 --> 06:31.478
that we are not interested
in an interview.

06:31.480 --> 06:33.914
Smart. Now, that's a smart idea.

06:33.916 --> 06:35.015
Yeah, but-but it's okay.

06:35.017 --> 06:37.584
We move on. Right? We're done.

You're done with college.

06:57.706 --> 06:58.905
What?

06:58.907 --> 07:00.474
I'm not a great bursar.

07:00.476 --> 07:02.709
I should have noticed
this earlier, but Heath...

07:02.711 --> 07:03.977
Um, it's "Heather," actually,

07:03.979 --> 07:06.213
so just one more syllable,
and then you're there.

07:06.215 --> 07:08.381
Okay, Heather.

07:08.383 --> 07:11.618
You've taken every course
we have, all of them.

07:11.620 --> 07:13.620
You took men's hockey... twice.

07:13.622 --> 07:15.489
Of course I did. The cool of the ice,

07:15.491 --> 07:17.157
the sound of the puck hitting the stick.

07:17.159 --> 07:18.552
What a rush.

07:18.577 --> 07:20.594
Well, we don't let people stay here

07:20.596 --> 07:22.129
after they've completed every course,

07:22.131 --> 07:25.565
so, once you finish
marine biology next week,

07:25.567 --> 07:27.501
you will be graduating.

07:27.503 --> 07:31.099
No. No. No, no. I'm a student.

07:31.124 --> 07:33.440
Oh, not after next week.

07:33.810 --> 07:36.276
Here is your cap and gown.

07:36.748 --> 07:38.288
Congratulations, Heather.

07:38.709 --> 07:40.247
Spread your wings.

07:40.249 --> 07:42.263
You're about to fly!

07:49.190 --> 07:50.724
Is everything okay in here, sir?

07:50.726 --> 07:52.259
Yes. Why?

07:52.521 --> 07:55.162
So, listen, Nathaniel,

07:55.164 --> 07:57.197
you've hired and fired
me numerous times.

07:57.199 --> 07:58.865
I've failed you at basically everything

07:58.867 --> 08:00.233
you've ever asked me to do.

08:00.235 --> 08:02.836
Does this lead anywhere other
than "you're fired" again?

08:02.838 --> 08:05.372
But I see it. I see
what I can do for you,

08:05.374 --> 08:07.007
what I can bring to this company.

08:07.009 --> 08:08.475
I told you, we don't want to feature

08:08.477 --> 08:10.243
your pottery in the lobby. Thanks.

08:10.245 --> 08:11.678
That's not it. That was just...

08:11.680 --> 08:13.246
That's one of the things that I offer,

08:13.248 --> 08:14.981
and I think it's actually
still very much on the table.

08:14.983 --> 08:16.383
What I was going to say, though, is,

08:16.385 --> 08:19.876
I bring a lifelong
experience in rejection.

08:20.853 --> 08:22.353
What are you talking about?

08:23.197 --> 08:24.858
Look, I saw you out there with Rebecca.

08:24.860 --> 08:27.462
She's blowing you off, sir, and I...

08:27.487 --> 08:30.509
- I mean, it's real clear.
- That's not it.

08:30.534 --> 08:33.767
We had sex, and now she's
busy, that's all.

08:33.769 --> 08:36.336
Oh.

08:36.337 --> 08:37.904
Nathaniel, Nathaniel, Nathaniel,

08:37.905 --> 08:39.139
Nathaniel...

08:39.140 --> 08:40.674
I've been through this, okay?

08:40.676 --> 08:42.741
And I know how to get you back in there

08:42.744 --> 08:44.044
when you're being ignored and rejected.

08:44.046 --> 08:46.079
This is not rejection.

08:46.081 --> 08:47.647
Okay, I don't get rejected.

08:47.649 --> 08:49.349
I've never been rejected. Look at me.

08:49.351 --> 08:51.551
I'm a white ten. I don't get rejected.

08:51.553 --> 08:52.986
I get approved for loans.

08:52.988 --> 08:55.622
I mean, that's so offensive to
both non-whites and non-tens,

08:55.624 --> 08:58.335
but, okay, can I explain
it to you this way, sir?

08:58.583 --> 09:00.760
All right, you gave it to her good.

09:00.762 --> 09:02.231
She liked it.

09:03.192 --> 09:05.298
Status up here, okay?

09:05.300 --> 09:06.800
Then she leaves your apartment.

09:06.802 --> 09:08.001
You're in bed

09:08.003 --> 09:10.804
clutching your covers to
your chin like a child.

09:11.790 --> 09:13.291
You call and text her.

09:13.544 --> 09:15.675
Now you're chasing her
through the entire office,

09:15.677 --> 09:18.111
being like, "Why won't
you call me?" Bam!

09:18.677 --> 09:20.447
You got to get the power back.

09:20.449 --> 09:24.217
You got to put the
"Plimp" back in "Plimpton."

09:24.219 --> 09:25.802
- You mean, "Pimp."
- I do not.

09:25.827 --> 09:27.754
Here's what you're
gonna do. Stay with me.

09:27.756 --> 09:29.623
You are going to ask
her out on another date.

09:29.625 --> 09:32.659
Then you're gonna make sweet,
sweet love to her, and then,

09:32.661 --> 09:36.463
you leave, you do not call.

09:36.716 --> 09:38.131
Where are you now?

09:39.802 --> 09:41.201
You're plimpin'.

09:41.710 --> 09:43.224
You're big plimpin'.

09:45.517 --> 09:47.654
You're an idiot, but...

09:48.377 --> 09:50.176
you make a certain kind of sense.

09:50.178 --> 09:51.411
Thank you so much.

09:51.413 --> 09:53.079
You know, my shoulders
are a little tight.

09:53.081 --> 09:55.849
And I would love to help. Thank you.

09:55.851 --> 09:58.951
And breathe.

09:59.352 --> 10:03.521
I really thought this
stuff was all really strong.

10:05.279 --> 10:09.095
Um, well, you know, it's-it's
hard to have perspective

10:09.097 --> 10:10.630
on our own work sometimes, right?

10:13.431 --> 10:15.669
Psst.

10:15.671 --> 10:17.671
Come on, got to talk to
you. Get to the bathroom.

10:17.673 --> 10:19.002
No.

10:20.008 --> 10:23.760
Means no and that's a lesson
for all you men.

10:25.080 --> 10:27.447
Hey, boobs. Big ol' boobs.

10:27.822 --> 10:30.963
- Over here. Get to the bathroom.
- Stop it.

10:30.988 --> 10:32.455
It's like...

10:32.480 --> 10:35.337
stop writing so many
books, Joyce Carol Oates.

10:35.362 --> 10:37.924
Amen. I'm drowning over here.

10:37.926 --> 10:39.244
You know who should write more books?

10:39.269 --> 10:40.601
Michael Crichton.

10:40.762 --> 10:42.362
He had all those hits and then...

10:42.364 --> 10:43.697
Yeah, he's dead.

10:43.699 --> 10:45.932
What? Wait, really?

10:46.286 --> 10:48.086
No.

10:48.401 --> 10:50.268
I got to make some calls.

10:50.372 --> 10:52.939
- Move, bitch.
- Okay!

10:52.941 --> 10:57.243
Okay, let's
all get some coffee.

10:57.245 --> 10:59.525
I'll be right back.

11:01.782 --> 11:04.451
Okay, what is wrong with you? I mean me.

11:04.453 --> 11:06.540
- Check your phone, dum-dum.
- What?

11:06.565 --> 11:09.756
You got an alert and you were
so busy making your best friend

11:09.758 --> 11:12.325
question her self-worth
that you didn't even notice.

11:12.327 --> 11:13.705
Okay. Fine.

11:14.763 --> 11:17.297
Josh Chan started a live video?

11:17.299 --> 11:18.814
Oh, my God.

11:18.869 --> 11:20.700
I've been off the grid for a while.

11:21.188 --> 11:23.570
Up here at the seminary, yo.

11:23.572 --> 11:27.007
Talking to G.O.D. and, uh,
I came to a big revelation.

11:27.009 --> 11:29.009
I have decided to leave the priesthood.

11:29.011 --> 11:30.773
That's right, everyone.

11:31.148 --> 11:32.881
Church is out of session for me.

11:33.048 --> 11:34.848
I'm-a coming home.

11:34.850 --> 11:36.082
Oh, boy.

11:36.084 --> 11:38.740
Looks like someone's
leaving priest school.

11:38.765 --> 11:40.453
And you know what that means.

11:40.455 --> 11:42.722
Okay, no, no, no. It
doesn't necessarily mean

11:42.724 --> 11:44.333
he's gonna tell everyone everything.

11:44.358 --> 11:45.958
I got a lot to tell everyone.

11:46.278 --> 11:47.543
A ton.

11:47.568 --> 11:49.963
Like, a crazy amount.

11:49.965 --> 11:51.965
But I want to tell everyone in person.

11:51.967 --> 11:54.211
So, I'm shouting out to my friends.

11:54.505 --> 11:56.269
If you want to get all the scoop,

11:56.271 --> 11:59.072
head on over to Home
Base for happy hour today.

11:59.074 --> 12:00.910
I'm gonna lay it all out for you.

12:01.754 --> 12:03.949
The Home Base Bacon Boppers are on me.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.003
See you then.

12:06.314 --> 12:07.781
Chan out.

12:08.848 --> 12:10.250
He's coming home

12:10.252 --> 12:12.852
and he's gonna tell
everybody everything.

12:12.854 --> 12:14.120
Oh, my God.

12:14.122 --> 12:15.422
What are we gonna do?

12:15.424 --> 12:17.090
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

12:17.092 --> 12:18.625
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

12:18.627 --> 12:20.226
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

12:20.228 --> 12:21.995
What are we gonna do?

12:24.928 --> 12:26.127
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

12:26.129 --> 12:27.662
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

12:27.664 --> 12:31.582
- Okay, don't panic, don't panic.
- I'm your anxiety manifested.

12:31.607 --> 12:34.013
That's all I do. I got one mode.

12:34.466 --> 12:37.711
Aah, let me think. All right.

12:38.607 --> 12:40.512
Do you remember what
we did in seventh grade

12:40.537 --> 12:43.396
to Tiffany Fendersmith when we were
running for student council treasurer?

12:43.421 --> 12:46.535
- That was awful what we did.
- Yeah, but we had no choice.

12:46.560 --> 12:48.410
She was gonna ruin our reputation.

12:48.412 --> 12:50.578
She saw us stuffing our bra
with maxi pads in the locker room

12:50.580 --> 12:51.646
and she was gonna tell everyone.

12:51.648 --> 12:54.576
I know, but still, what
we did was pretty bad.

12:54.607 --> 12:58.242
We had to, okay? We had to spread the
rumor that she had a brain tumor

12:58.244 --> 13:01.168
that caused her to tell
pathological lies and it worked.

13:01.193 --> 13:02.613
We won the election

13:02.615 --> 13:05.116
and everyone called her
Tiffany Tumorsmith for years.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.717
It was pretty low.

13:06.719 --> 13:10.054
- I spiraled with guilt for months.
- Yeah, I know. I was there.

13:10.056 --> 13:11.474
But what choice do we have?

13:12.568 --> 13:15.466
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

13:15.491 --> 13:18.623
So, we're gonna tell
people Josh has a tumor?

13:18.648 --> 13:20.114
No.

13:20.233 --> 13:22.567
We're gonna tell people
that Josh is the tumor.

13:22.569 --> 13:24.635
I'm not following me here.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.512
We're gonna discredit Josh.

13:26.537 --> 13:29.507
So even if he tells people
what happened in the church,

13:29.509 --> 13:32.176
it won't matter, 'cause
no one will believe him.

13:32.499 --> 13:34.600
Me, follow me.

13:36.784 --> 13:38.451
Hi, it's me.

13:38.476 --> 13:40.209
Are you sitting down?

13:40.592 --> 13:41.953
It's about Crichton.

13:41.955 --> 13:44.856
Hey. I am so sorry about earlier.

13:44.858 --> 13:46.157
You were totally right.

13:46.159 --> 13:49.060
We need to stand proud
with our-our shoulders back,

13:49.062 --> 13:51.095
and our head high, or
whatever it is you said.

13:51.097 --> 13:54.279
I want to do the case and
the article with The Corset.

13:56.935 --> 13:59.670
You said the case stunk.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.006
No. No. That was fear talking.

14:02.008 --> 14:04.540
- Really?
- I was afraid.

14:04.841 --> 14:07.879
And, you know what, we need to get Josh

14:07.881 --> 14:09.513
and we need to get him now.

14:10.216 --> 14:14.585
So, should we take another look
at these case filings, though?

14:14.587 --> 14:17.021
I mean, because, I mean, you have notes.

14:17.023 --> 14:18.656
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
later, later, later.

14:18.658 --> 14:19.857
Soon, soon, soon, soon, soon.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.292
But, like, right now, I just,

14:21.294 --> 14:25.496
I need you to call The Corset
and tell them it's go time.

14:25.498 --> 14:30.083
I am ready to share
my truth... our truth.

14:31.136 --> 14:32.169
I'm ready to be heroes.

14:32.171 --> 14:33.571
Let's be heroes. Do
you want to be a hero?

14:34.721 --> 14:35.940
Okay.

14:42.114 --> 14:43.547
Heather.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.249
You're finally graduating.

14:45.620 --> 14:47.919
That's so great. You did it.

14:47.921 --> 14:50.388
You've reached for the moon
and landed among the stars.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.189
I guess so.

14:52.191 --> 14:54.058
You-you guess so?

14:54.060 --> 14:56.661
Heather, this is it,
your moment to shine,

14:56.663 --> 14:58.796
to tell the world that it's your time.

14:59.098 --> 15:00.398
Oh, God.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.899
Do I have to sing an inspirational

15:01.901 --> 15:03.234

Thank you so much for meeting us here.

17:07.260 --> 17:08.792
We are massive fans of The Corset.

17:08.795 --> 17:10.560
Oh, my God, such huge fans.

17:10.563 --> 17:12.762
And we really think that
this story is gonna inspire

17:12.765 --> 17:14.598
a whole new generation
of female attorneys

17:14.599 --> 17:17.867
and-and show how the
law can work for women.

17:17.869 --> 17:20.471
Yes, and by the way, we
would've met you at your office.

17:20.473 --> 17:21.739
Oh, I don't have an office.

17:21.741 --> 17:22.873
I can't afford it yet.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.308
I'm working out of my mom's sun-room,

17:24.310 --> 17:25.742
but today is her book club day.

17:25.744 --> 17:27.611
They're doing four
Joyce Carol Oates books

17:27.613 --> 17:29.380
and it's like, Joyce, enough.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.515
- Like, we get it. Just stop.
- Mm-hmm.

17:31.517 --> 17:35.352
Okay, so, tell me more about
this lawsuit against your ex

17:35.354 --> 17:36.821
and how he jilted you.

17:36.823 --> 17:38.322
Well, you know, that's not the only

17:38.324 --> 17:39.757
important part of the case.

17:39.759 --> 17:42.593
Uh, 'twere it so simple
as that, but it 'twaint.

17:42.595 --> 17:45.229
He jilted me, yes, but
the-the most important thing

17:45.231 --> 17:47.398
people need to know is that he's a liar

17:47.400 --> 17:49.900
and that anything that comes
out of his mouth is a lie

17:49.902 --> 17:51.625
because he's a lying liar man.

17:53.172 --> 17:54.305
Yes.

17:54.307 --> 17:56.874
That's, um, that's
definitely part of it.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.679
But, you know, I-I think of him more

17:58.704 --> 18:00.711
as someone who failed to
perform their fiduciary

18:00.713 --> 18:02.780
and emotional obligations,
and is, therefore,

18:02.805 --> 18:04.682
- liable in a court of law.
- Mm-hmm.

18:04.684 --> 18:06.750
Sure, sure, sure, sure,
sure. Yeah, b-b-b-but, but...

18:06.752 --> 18:08.953
But circling back to the lies.

18:08.955 --> 18:10.788
I mean, I-it's just so many lies.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.756
Like, for instance, when
he comes back to town

18:12.758 --> 18:14.558
and tells people crazy lies about me,

18:14.560 --> 18:18.796
he is 100% lying because
he lies all the time.

18:18.798 --> 18:21.332
Oh. Okay. Okay, what kind of lies?

18:21.334 --> 18:22.800
Great question. I have an itemized list

18:22.802 --> 18:24.368
of all the lies right here.

18:24.370 --> 18:26.570
What is that? Is that exhibit "R"?

18:26.936 --> 18:29.874
No. It's exhibits "L" and
"D," for Lies and Deception.

18:29.876 --> 18:33.177
That's not
how we code exhibits.

18:33.179 --> 18:36.013
"Josh lied about believing in God
and he only joined the priesthood

18:36.015 --> 18:38.983
- to steal donations from the church"?
- Yep.

18:38.985 --> 18:42.052
Wow. That's not great.

18:42.054 --> 18:44.288
But, uh, I mean, you know,

18:44.290 --> 18:47.758
even if he did, it's-it's
not really germane to our...

18:47.760 --> 18:49.460
Wait. This guy is truly awful.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.861
"Josh told his friend Josh Wilson... "

18:50.863 --> 18:52.530
White Josh. You're gonna
want to use his street name.

18:52.532 --> 18:53.831
"... that he was okay with gay people,

18:53.833 --> 18:56.066
- but he's not."
- No, he's not. He doesn't like

18:56.068 --> 18:57.902
the "L"s, the "B"s,
the "G"s, or the "T"s.

18:57.904 --> 19:00.604
And he doesn't want any
of them to have restrooms.

19:00.606 --> 19:02.973
- Hold on a second. What?
- D-Did you see the part

19:02.975 --> 19:04.175
that he, uh, told his
Hispanic friend Hector

19:04.177 --> 19:06.510
that he listens to his podcasts,

19:06.512 --> 19:09.780
but he doesn't, specifically
because he's racist. Yeah.

19:09.782 --> 19:12.550
He only listens to, like,
those white public radio shows.

19:12.552 --> 19:13.888
- Oh.
- Yep.

19:13.913 --> 19:15.719
Public radio? Josh?

19:15.721 --> 19:18.622
I mean, is there a different
public radio? One with pictures?

19:18.624 --> 19:21.392
Carly, you can see that
this is a huge story

19:21.394 --> 19:24.464
about a man who embodies
deception and lies,

19:24.489 --> 19:26.864
so we want to get it out
there as quick as possible.

19:26.866 --> 19:28.132
Yeah. I'll get to work on it.

19:28.134 --> 19:29.567
I'll probably be able
to run it this week.

19:29.569 --> 19:31.468
Oh, a week. I mean, uh, that's just hard

19:31.470 --> 19:33.137
because we actually have
a lot of other offers.

19:33.139 --> 19:34.967
So if you want to be
the one to break this...

19:34.992 --> 19:36.907
And I want it to be you, I really do...

19:36.909 --> 19:38.509
You got to kind of Joyce
Carol Oates this thing

19:38.511 --> 19:39.977
and publish it ASAP.

19:39.979 --> 19:42.179
You know, preferably before happy hour,

19:42.181 --> 19:44.848
because that's when people
check their phones the most.

19:44.850 --> 19:47.117
Okay. I'll-I'll get to
work. I'll see what I can do.

19:47.119 --> 19:48.385
- Great.
- Great.

19:48.387 --> 19:49.853
Thank you so much.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.088
Thank you so much.

19:51.090 --> 19:53.290
- So nice to meet you.
- So nice to meet you.

19:53.292 --> 19:54.825
Fighting the good fight.

19:56.027 --> 19:57.828
Okay. I know you're
wondering why I never told you

19:57.830 --> 20:00.331
about all of Josh's
hideous lies, but I...

20:00.333 --> 20:02.199
I just wanted you to like him. Okay?

20:02.201 --> 20:03.901
We worked so hard to land
him, and I don't know.

20:03.903 --> 20:05.102
I thought I could change him. I-I...

20:05.104 --> 20:06.737
No. No, no, no. I get it. I get it.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.606
I... I guess, but I,

20:08.608 --> 20:11.108
I mean, is that why you were afraid

20:11.110 --> 20:13.344
to file the case and go public earlier?

20:13.346 --> 20:15.479
Yes. Yes, that's why.

20:15.481 --> 20:17.548
But it-it doesn't matter now
because we're doing the case,

20:17.550 --> 20:19.116
and the article's coming out,

20:19.118 --> 20:20.718
and hopefully it'll be
out before happy hour.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.219
I mean, soon, soon.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.587
Yeah.

20:33.876 --> 20:37.143
_

20:37.168 --> 20:38.869
I just can't believe it.

20:38.871 --> 20:41.138
Come on. Come on, come on, come on.

20:41.140 --> 20:43.774
I just can't believe it.

20:45.677 --> 20:47.611
Okay, so that was your cue to say,

20:47.613 --> 20:49.480
"What's wrong, Heath?"
And then I would say,

20:49.482 --> 20:50.514
"It's actually Heather."

20:50.516 --> 20:52.249
And then we would talk about my problem.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.717
Okay, uh, fine. What's your problem?

20:53.719 --> 20:57.021
Okay, so my stupid college
is forcing me to graduate.

20:57.023 --> 20:58.522
Oh, my gosh. Congrats. Mazel.

20:58.524 --> 21:00.024
No, it's no mazel.

21:00.026 --> 21:01.892
I don't want to graduate.

21:01.894 --> 21:03.394
I'm a student.

21:03.396 --> 21:05.329
I like saying, "I'm a student."

21:05.991 --> 21:07.765
Marine biology is my last class,

21:07.767 --> 21:10.401
and I'm sad... I
wanted to take it again.

21:10.403 --> 21:12.369
It would give me more
time with Estrella.

21:12.663 --> 21:14.104
I'm sorry, who?

21:14.106 --> 21:16.040
Um, Estrella.

21:16.042 --> 21:18.142
Our third roommate. Are you kidding?

21:18.144 --> 21:19.810
The starfish I've been taking care of

21:19.812 --> 21:20.978
for, like, three months.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.680
Right there by the sink,

21:22.682 --> 21:24.882
in the flawless synthetic
marine environment

21:24.884 --> 21:26.016
I created for her.

21:26.018 --> 21:27.518
Okay, honestly, I
thought that was a sponge,

21:27.520 --> 21:29.687
so, you know, it's a good
thing I don't do dishes, right?

21:29.689 --> 21:31.755
- You're literally the worst.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

21:31.757 --> 21:34.325
Um, all right, you
don't want to graduate.

21:34.327 --> 21:37.394
So, you know, just fail the class,
and you can stay.

21:38.095 --> 21:40.597
How do I fail? I'm doing so well.

21:40.599 --> 21:42.009
Kill the sponge. Duh.

21:42.034 --> 21:43.524
What?

21:44.537 --> 21:46.070
Murder my starfish?

21:46.072 --> 21:48.205
I mean, she doesn't have

21:48.207 --> 21:50.274
a central nervous system,
so it wouldn't hurt,

21:50.276 --> 21:53.610
but she does have five
eyes that look into my soul.

21:53.612 --> 21:55.813
Oh, my God! Oh, my
God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

21:55.815 --> 21:57.214
Come here, come here,
come here, come here.

21:57.216 --> 21:59.116
Look at this, look at this,
look at this, look at this.

21:59.118 --> 22:01.752
- It's up, it's up, it's up... oh!
- _

22:03.055 --> 22:05.022
It's even better than I imagined.

22:05.024 --> 22:08.192
"Don't date this toxic man:
stand up to the patriarchy,

22:08.194 --> 22:10.661
one Josh at a time."

22:10.663 --> 22:12.863
Whoa, Josh is an anti-vaxxer?

22:12.865 --> 22:14.798
I had no idea.

22:14.800 --> 22:17.134
Can you forward this post
to everyone you've ever met

22:17.136 --> 22:18.902
in your entire life?

22:18.904 --> 22:20.637
Yeah.

22:20.639 --> 22:23.340
Now, I knew Josh was a jerk
because he ditched Rebecca,

22:23.342 --> 22:25.903
but he's also a homophobic
Holocaust denier?

22:25.928 --> 22:28.078
- Did you know about this?
- Some of it, not all of it.

22:28.080 --> 22:29.713
Hello, everyone.

22:29.715 --> 22:32.249
Oh, are you all reading
it? Yeah. You forwarding it?

22:32.251 --> 22:34.184
Are you gramming it, screenshotting it,

22:34.186 --> 22:35.919
tweetin' it, sendin' it
to friends, group text,

22:35.921 --> 22:36.987
all that jazz, yeah?

22:36.989 --> 22:39.022
- You doing that?
- I can't believe all this.

22:39.024 --> 22:40.858
Josh is so dishonest.

22:40.860 --> 22:43.627
I mean, nobody's gonna believe
anything he says ever again.

22:43.629 --> 22:46.263
Oh, my God, really? You think so?
'Cause that'd be great.

22:46.265 --> 22:47.931
I mean, that'd be great
because he's... he's a liar,

22:47.933 --> 22:50.434
and it's been really hard
and horrible, but, um,

22:50.436 --> 22:52.236
but-but keep forwarding, okay? Yeah.

22:53.612 --> 22:54.979
Poor kid.

22:58.444 --> 23:00.677
- Hi.
- Hi, hi.

23:00.679 --> 23:02.913
Uh, I'm actually, I'm
kind of busy right now.

23:02.915 --> 23:04.681
You're gonna have dinner
with me, tonight, 8:00 p.m.

23:04.683 --> 23:06.417
My place. Be there.

23:06.419 --> 23:08.152
Uh, wow, I-I just, I...

23:08.154 --> 23:10.053
I'm not gonna take no for an answer.

23:10.055 --> 23:12.022
This guy has dirt on us, remember?

23:12.024 --> 23:13.657
He almost killed someone for us.

23:13.659 --> 23:15.192
You have to appease him.

23:15.194 --> 23:18.028
Also, he's fly. You're
turning that down?

23:18.030 --> 23:19.830
Say yes, dumb idiot.

23:19.832 --> 23:21.999
Okay, actually, fine.

23:22.001 --> 23:24.301
See you then, 8:00 p.m.

23:28.873 --> 23:30.574
What?

23:36.649 --> 23:39.546
Ah, the smells of a man's boyhood.

23:39.752 --> 23:43.195
I am that man. And that boy.

23:43.789 --> 23:45.556
And I have a hood.

23:45.558 --> 23:48.258
God, I love it when sentences work out.

23:51.505 --> 23:55.866
You're all here! What
up, y'all? Ooh-ooh!

23:55.868 --> 23:57.734
Ha-ha, my bros!

23:57.736 --> 24:00.103
White Josh and Hector and Chris.

24:00.105 --> 24:01.505
Kev, baby.

24:03.341 --> 24:05.509
You all look a little cranky.

24:05.511 --> 24:06.643
You hungry?

24:06.645 --> 24:08.779
Kevin, where are those Bacon Boppers?

24:08.781 --> 24:10.457
Up your butt.

24:17.419 --> 24:19.254
What's wrong?

24:19.427 --> 24:21.809
Are you mad because
I left the priesthood?

24:22.278 --> 24:24.345
Um, you guys told me to come home.

24:24.347 --> 24:26.965
No, we're mad because
you're a lying liar lie-man!

24:27.005 --> 24:28.171
Okay, okay.

24:28.173 --> 24:29.672
Calm down, bud. It's all good.

24:29.674 --> 24:31.974
Josh, we just read a
crazy article about you.

24:31.976 --> 24:33.042
What is going on, dude?

24:33.044 --> 24:35.734
What article? What
are you talking about?

24:35.759 --> 24:37.103
Well, read this.

24:45.856 --> 24:48.558
It's gonna... it's gonna be a while.

24:50.060 --> 24:52.061
Okay, well, wait. Th-This is all wrong.

24:52.063 --> 24:53.529
This is not about me.

24:53.531 --> 24:55.898
This article must be
about the other Josh Chan,

24:55.900 --> 24:58.543
the one from Azusa, uh, uh,
but they used my picture.

24:58.837 --> 25:02.138
Uh-huh. So you're saying
that there's another Josh Chan

25:02.140 --> 25:03.773
that also dated Rebecca

25:03.775 --> 25:05.775
and also tried to join the priesthood?

25:05.777 --> 25:07.710
Maybe? Guys, you know me.

25:07.712 --> 25:10.279
I-I would never do or say these things.

25:10.281 --> 25:13.616
I don't know, Josh. It's on the
Internet. It's probably true.

25:13.618 --> 25:14.784
I mean, some of it's true.

25:14.786 --> 25:17.497
Like, sometimes you call me "amigo,"

25:17.522 --> 25:19.055
and you know I don't like it.

25:19.057 --> 25:21.190
Yeah, and you know what?
Now that we're talking about this...

25:21.192 --> 25:23.993
In fifth grade, you used
to call me "Fancy Pants."

25:23.995 --> 25:26.696
They were fancy pants. So many pockets.

25:26.698 --> 25:27.997
Gay pockets?

25:27.999 --> 25:29.899
You always let me win in pinball?

25:29.901 --> 25:31.100
How is that not a lie?

25:31.316 --> 25:32.835
Oh, my God, I think it's working.

25:32.837 --> 25:34.403
Guys, guys, come on.

25:34.405 --> 25:36.539
Don't you see who is
behind this? It's obvious.

25:36.541 --> 25:38.433
I mean, look who's
quoted in this article.

25:38.776 --> 25:41.177
- Joyce Carol Oates?
- Rebecca!

25:41.753 --> 25:44.614
Those things in the
article all come from her,

25:44.616 --> 25:46.716
and she's completely out of her mind.

25:46.718 --> 25:47.950
Out of her mind?

25:47.952 --> 25:50.152
Okay, dude, I mean, she's
a little peculiar, but...

25:50.154 --> 25:52.788
No. No, no, no, no, no. I'm-I'm
telling you, I know the truth.

25:52.790 --> 25:55.825
Yesterday she came up to
seminary in her wedding dress.

25:55.827 --> 25:59.228
She told me the craziest
stuff I've ever heard.

25:59.297 --> 26:01.797
She admitted she moved
here just to stalk me.

26:01.799 --> 26:04.567
She's been spying on me since
the second she got into town.

26:04.569 --> 26:05.902
She secretly

26:05.904 --> 26:07.970
watched me have sex on
two separate occasions.

26:07.972 --> 26:09.984
She put a GPS on my car.

26:10.009 --> 26:13.142
She wore a secret camera to Thanksgiving

26:13.144 --> 26:14.777
to spy on my family, she paid

26:14.779 --> 26:16.846
thousands of dollars
to move up our wedding,

26:16.848 --> 26:19.882
- and tried to murder Gravy.
- Say what now?

26:19.884 --> 26:21.951
Anna's pretty Persian
kitty. Keep up, Hector.

26:21.953 --> 26:23.686
I'm telling you, Rebecca's crazy,

26:23.688 --> 26:26.556
and basically, a-a criminal
mastermind, too.

26:26.558 --> 26:28.524
I-I bet you all have
cameras all over you.

26:32.983 --> 26:34.764
Oh, my God. Do you hear yourself, dude?

26:34.789 --> 26:36.139
This doesn't make any sense.

26:36.164 --> 26:38.778
Yeah, she's a smart lawyer,
and you want us to believe that

26:38.803 --> 26:41.241
she just blabbed all this
incriminating stuff to you?

26:41.606 --> 26:43.773
- I don't know, amigo.
- Face it, dude.

26:43.775 --> 26:46.742
The only person who sounds
crazy right now is you.

26:48.694 --> 26:54.304
So, please leave, Joshua, so that
we can have a happy... hour.

26:59.423 --> 27:01.390
Thank you.

27:01.392 --> 27:03.593
Here you go, Chris.

27:04.528 --> 27:06.495
- Oh, boy.
- It's working!

27:07.760 --> 27:08.931
Yeah.

27:09.424 --> 27:11.000
Wow, it really is.

27:11.456 --> 27:12.955
We're ruining him!

27:12.957 --> 27:14.331
It's great.

27:14.924 --> 27:16.237
Yeah.

27:17.887 --> 27:19.135
Guess we won.

27:25.940 --> 27:27.573
- Hey.
- What?

27:27.598 --> 27:28.995
You okay?

27:29.956 --> 27:32.377
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, of course. Of course.

27:32.402 --> 27:34.892
- Justice is being served.
- Yes, it is.

27:35.573 --> 27:37.791
Paula, um...

27:38.750 --> 27:40.487
I just want to thank
you for supporting me,

27:41.031 --> 27:42.997
you know, through all this.

27:43.054 --> 27:44.557
You're a great friend. Thank you.

27:44.582 --> 27:47.073
Well, honey, of course I support you.

27:47.098 --> 27:49.145
I'm Team Rebecca, always.

27:49.685 --> 27:52.627
And we are doing a good thing

27:52.652 --> 27:54.979
with this case, I promise you.

27:55.600 --> 27:58.281
- You're a role model.
- No, don't say that.

27:58.306 --> 27:59.606
But you are.

27:59.631 --> 28:04.276
You are like a Madonna,
Malala, Moana salad.

28:07.078 --> 28:09.916
- You really think I'm a role model?
- Yes, absolutely.

28:10.462 --> 28:11.995
Hmm.

28:23.197 --> 28:25.737
_

28:25.762 --> 28:29.499
I am not the crazy one.

28:45.910 --> 28:48.044
Well, it's 8:30.

28:48.046 --> 28:49.799
She's probably just a
little late, that's all.

28:49.824 --> 28:51.390
I don't know, man.

28:51.729 --> 28:55.385
- I'm sorry. I don't think she's coming.
- You're probably right.

28:55.387 --> 28:57.190
Damn it, George.

28:57.276 --> 28:59.310
You were supposed to
protect me from rejection,

28:59.312 --> 29:01.312
and all I got was more rejection.

29:01.870 --> 29:03.914
Also, where do you get
off calling me "man"?

29:03.916 --> 29:05.316
Of course. I'm sorry... sir.

29:05.318 --> 29:07.151
I failed you.

29:07.153 --> 29:08.285
How can I help now?

29:08.480 --> 29:10.521
Should we grab a beer
and talk? Hash it out?

29:10.523 --> 29:12.156
Really work through
some of those feelings?

29:12.158 --> 29:14.425
George, I hate and
reject philosophically

29:14.427 --> 29:16.694
all the things that you just listed.

29:17.362 --> 29:18.386
No.

29:18.808 --> 29:20.264
When I'm in this kind of mood,

29:21.871 --> 29:23.911
I know what I need to do.

This guy Trent gave that
to me the day of the wedding.

31:50.948 --> 31:52.915
Eh, Trent is Rebecca's ex-boyfriend.

31:52.917 --> 31:54.116
Weird guy.

31:54.501 --> 31:56.285
Always wears turtlenecks.

31:56.287 --> 31:58.153
Anyway, he gave this to me.

31:58.297 --> 31:59.755
And you never opened it?

31:59.757 --> 32:01.000
I was afraid to.

32:01.531 --> 32:03.425
I-I knew it probably said
bad stuff about Rebecca,

32:03.427 --> 32:05.260
and I didn't want to know what it was,

32:05.262 --> 32:08.597
and I knew I had too
many doubts to marry her,

32:08.599 --> 32:09.865
no matter what her past was.

32:09.867 --> 32:12.501
So when I got to the
seminary, I just threw it out.

32:12.875 --> 32:14.436
Then, like,

32:14.438 --> 32:17.039
in the middle of the night, I
woke up, ran out to the trash,

32:17.041 --> 32:19.133
grabbed it and put it in my duffle bag.

32:19.695 --> 32:22.144
My Spidey-sense told
me I might need it.

32:22.297 --> 32:23.412
And now, I think I do.

32:23.414 --> 32:25.614
Because she is coming after me, man.

32:25.616 --> 32:26.982
She's trying to ruin my life.

32:26.984 --> 32:28.784
So now, I need to know what's in there.

32:29.078 --> 32:31.086
Then you need to open it, Josh.

32:31.088 --> 32:33.055
You're an adult now, dude.

32:33.057 --> 32:35.090
These are your choices to make.

32:35.092 --> 32:38.460
But what if there's anthrax,
or... a dead body in there?

32:38.462 --> 32:40.663
Uh, you think there's a dead
body inside that envelope?

32:40.665 --> 32:43.666
I don't know, like, ashes or
something with spirits in it?

32:43.781 --> 32:45.868
Okay. You know what?
Let's... let's do it.

32:45.870 --> 32:47.803
Let's just open the envelope. Okay?

32:48.313 --> 32:50.480
Thanks.

33:09.606 --> 33:11.472
Morning.

33:13.644 --> 33:15.676
So, I didn't do it.

33:15.678 --> 33:17.145
I didn't kill Estrella.

33:17.147 --> 33:20.214
I was up all night looking
into each and every eye,

33:20.216 --> 33:21.582
and I just, like, couldn't...

33:21.584 --> 33:24.352
Hey, guess what, you know this
whole, like, role model thing?

33:24.354 --> 33:25.620
I could get used to it.

33:25.622 --> 33:28.389
Like, I just woke up to an
e-mail from... wait for it...

33:28.391 --> 33:31.092
Sally Jessy Raphael's people.

33:31.094 --> 33:32.727
Okay, so she's coming back.

33:32.729 --> 33:34.595
She's starting a new show.

33:34.597 --> 33:36.597
It's Web-based, it's streaming,
it's a podcast, I don't know,

33:36.599 --> 33:37.899
but I'm very excited.

33:38.421 --> 33:41.622
Right, so I guess I'm
gonna have to graduate.

33:41.647 --> 33:43.004
And, if I'm gonna be the face

33:43.006 --> 33:44.572
of a groundbreaking lawsuit,

33:44.574 --> 33:47.364
I mean, I'm gonna need some
new feminist nail art, right?

33:47.389 --> 33:49.210
Hey, do you want to come
with me later to get some?

33:49.212 --> 33:52.046
- Sure. Well, thanks for listening.
- Oh, my God. Any time, babe.

33:52.048 --> 33:53.952
Okay.

33:55.515 --> 33:57.081
Okay, so I'm thinking the word "woman"

33:57.083 --> 33:58.952
could be spelled out on my
fingers, but with, like, a "Y,"

33:58.977 --> 34:00.311
or maybe just, like,
a bunch of unicorns.

34:00.336 --> 34:01.506
I don't know. I'll text you.

34:05.382 --> 34:06.515
All right, girl.

34:06.782 --> 34:09.303
Guess we're gonna have
to cap and gown it.

34:09.793 --> 34:12.350
The moment is me.

34:13.440 --> 34:14.974
Ugh.

34:16.710 --> 34:18.260
Sir, I've been thinking about it,

34:18.262 --> 34:20.529
and yes, we had a setback.

34:20.531 --> 34:22.898
But I think there's still time
to change this power dynamic.

34:22.900 --> 34:25.346
All right? I re-read The
Art of War last night...

34:25.371 --> 34:26.744
George, we're way past all that.

34:27.504 --> 34:30.494
You don't understand;
the zoo didn't work.

34:30.822 --> 34:32.155
The zoo.

34:32.658 --> 34:34.109
I feel the same way today

34:34.110 --> 34:35.377
as I did yesterday.

34:35.379 --> 34:37.179
It's awful. My stomach hurts.

34:37.181 --> 34:38.647
I can't eat anything.

34:38.649 --> 34:41.149
I'm doodling pictures of
Rebecca on every legal brief.

34:41.150 --> 34:43.585
- I'm smiling at babies.
- Oh...

34:43.587 --> 34:45.489
- Babies are disgusting.
- Mm-hmm.

34:45.514 --> 34:47.022
This is more than sex and power.

34:47.024 --> 34:48.223
This is something else.

34:48.225 --> 34:49.591
Oh, no.

34:51.061 --> 34:53.185
Oh, my God, I think I like her.

34:53.210 --> 34:55.364
Hi. Did you hear about
Sally Jessy Raphael?

34:55.366 --> 34:57.632
It's okay, I'll tell you
later. It's fine. Yeah.

34:59.334 --> 35:01.169
Hey, Darryl, have you seen Paula?

35:01.171 --> 35:02.904
Yeah, she was here earlier,
working on that case

35:02.906 --> 35:04.072
that you guys have been doing,

35:04.074 --> 35:05.540
that doesn't make any
money for the firm,

35:05.542 --> 35:06.808
but I don't say anything about.

35:06.810 --> 35:08.944
And then, suddenly, she
checked her messages,

35:08.946 --> 35:10.112
and ran out the door.

35:10.454 --> 35:13.046
- Messages?
- Yep. By the way,

35:13.071 --> 35:14.783
the reason I was confused earlier

35:14.785 --> 35:16.451
is that some of Michael Crichton's books

35:16.453 --> 35:18.019
came out after he died.

35:18.161 --> 35:20.344
They were published posthumously.

35:20.688 --> 35:22.221
After he was a human.

35:28.030 --> 35:29.564
What do I do?

35:29.566 --> 35:30.665
What do I do, George?

35:30.667 --> 35:32.067
I think there's only
one thing you can do.

35:32.069 --> 35:33.602
I think you have to
tell her your feelings.

35:33.604 --> 35:35.442
I told you I hate that kind of thing.

35:35.467 --> 35:38.000
I know, I know, I know,
but I think you have to,

35:38.308 --> 35:40.275
or you might regret it.

35:46.450 --> 35:47.816
Paula Proctor.

35:47.818 --> 35:49.551
You have one saved message.

35:49.553 --> 35:51.586
Hey, Paula. It's me, Father Brah.

35:51.588 --> 35:53.522
We have an emergency.

35:53.524 --> 35:55.056
It's about Rebecca.

35:55.058 --> 35:56.591
Can you come down to the office?

35:56.593 --> 35:58.360
Oh, uh, and for now, it's probably best

35:58.362 --> 36:00.662
if you don't talk about this with her.

36:04.536 --> 36:06.102
Uh, uh, Rebecca, wait.

36:07.069 --> 36:09.337
Go.

36:10.273 --> 36:12.875
So, you said it was
a Rebecca emergency... ?

36:14.378 --> 36:16.011
What is Josh doing here?

36:16.013 --> 36:18.280
Paula, Robert is not a dog.

36:18.485 --> 36:21.216
I drove through traffic
for "Robert is not a dog"?

36:21.218 --> 36:22.884
Paula, why don't you have a seat?

36:22.886 --> 36:24.252
Yeah.

36:24.254 --> 36:25.962
Why don't I just have a seat?

36:27.751 --> 36:30.192
Paula, Robert was Rebecca's professor,

36:30.194 --> 36:31.602
and, uh...

36:31.627 --> 36:34.142
there were some things
that happened between them.

36:35.860 --> 36:37.160
This is a restraining order

36:37.649 --> 36:39.301
that he was granted after Rebecca

36:39.303 --> 36:42.037
tried to burn down his apartment.

36:43.539 --> 36:48.210
This is a sealed criminal indictment
for the attempted arson.

36:50.488 --> 36:51.755
Now, instead of prison,

36:51.780 --> 36:54.541
she was sentenced to
a psychiatric hospital.

36:56.919 --> 36:58.534
These are the intake papers.

37:02.024 --> 37:03.955
Now, according to Josh,

37:03.980 --> 37:07.840
she hasn't told anyone in
West Covina about her past,

37:07.865 --> 37:10.651
- and I know that I am using a calm tone
- _

37:11.068 --> 37:13.368
right now, but, um...

37:14.159 --> 37:15.596
I am, I'm freaking out.

37:16.034 --> 37:19.183
Oh, my God. I mean, I... I had no idea.

37:19.208 --> 37:22.444
No, I-I know. Um, it's
shocking for all of us.

37:24.076 --> 37:26.114
It's like we never really knew her.

37:26.413 --> 37:28.443
Yeah, you're screwed.

37:37.342 --> 37:38.975
Okay, maybe-maybe
I, maybe I can talk to them.

37:38.977 --> 37:41.176
- Maybe I can explain.
- Are you crazy?

37:41.201 --> 37:43.349
We got to run. We got to start over.

37:43.374 --> 37:45.680
What? Don't pack a pantsuit.
We don't need pantsuits!

37:45.705 --> 37:47.177
Why are you panicking?

37:47.202 --> 37:49.774
They're my friends, they love
me, they'll-they'll understand.

37:49.799 --> 37:52.185
- They'll forgive me.
- Like Robert forgave you?

37:52.210 --> 37:53.709
Like Josh forgave you?

37:53.734 --> 37:55.200
Babe, trust me, you're going

37:55.225 --> 37:57.826
straight back to that loony
bin unless we get out of here.

37:57.851 --> 37:59.998
These people are not your friends.

38:00.038 --> 38:02.724
You've never had friends
before, so why would you now?

38:02.749 --> 38:03.948
No, you're right.

38:03.973 --> 38:06.468
They're not my friends.
I mean, why would they be?

38:06.493 --> 38:08.802
Who would like me? I'm gross,
I-I'm stupid and I'm a dum-dum.

38:08.827 --> 38:11.037
Now pack a damn pantsuit
'cause you never know.

38:11.062 --> 38:12.194
Okay, good point.

38:12.363 --> 38:13.396
All right, well,

38:13.867 --> 38:15.767
your anxiety has ruined your life,

38:15.769 --> 38:17.268
so I guess I'm done.

38:17.270 --> 38:18.469
I'm out of here.

38:18.471 --> 38:20.319
What? No. Don't-don't leave me.

38:20.344 --> 38:22.427
Please, I can't be alone.
I can't be alone. Please.

38:22.452 --> 38:23.851
I can't be alone with my thoughts!

38:24.083 --> 38:26.811
Oh, you came back.

38:28.111 --> 38:30.538
Nathaniel? What are you doing here?

38:31.651 --> 38:34.163
I'm here to tell you that
there are feelings inside of me

38:34.188 --> 38:35.257
that are pertinent to you.

38:35.282 --> 38:37.030
- Huh?
- I've tried to deny

38:37.055 --> 38:40.514
my very embarrassing
and... human emotions,

38:40.539 --> 38:42.606
but I can't, okay? So here they are.

38:46.340 --> 38:47.573
I feel things for you.

38:47.974 --> 38:50.941
Oh... God... oh.
Oh, that's what this is.

38:51.037 --> 38:54.105
Listen. Okay, listen. Buddy, I've
been in your position before,

38:54.107 --> 38:56.421
but now is not the time.
I-I got a whole thing going on, and...

38:56.446 --> 38:58.030
I-I got to get the hell out of town...

38:58.055 --> 39:00.412
Okay, great.
That's perfect. Let's get out of town.

39:00.437 --> 39:01.937
I'll call my jet, tell them to fuel up,

39:01.962 --> 39:03.460
- and we'll go, we'll go away together.
- No.

39:03.485 --> 39:06.119
Go away together, no... right.

39:06.413 --> 39:07.813
Oh, right. You have a jet.

39:07.835 --> 39:10.135
Yeah, and I'll take you
wherever you want to go.

39:10.137 --> 39:12.646
Rome, Paris? God, I
don't even know who I am.

39:12.671 --> 39:14.147
I've never done anything
like this before.

39:14.172 --> 39:15.718
This is... crazy.

39:15.743 --> 39:17.976
What? No, don't, don't.
Don't, don't. Stop it. Stop...

39:18.001 --> 39:20.202
Oh. Oh, wow. This is nice.

39:20.541 --> 39:22.107
Oh, I'm really tired.

39:22.109 --> 39:24.609
Ah. And you know what?
Rome sounds a lot better

39:24.611 --> 39:26.718
than I was gonna do, which was
just drive until my gas ran out.

39:26.743 --> 39:28.576
So you know what? Let's do it.

39:28.601 --> 39:29.663
- Can you grab my bag?
- Yeah.

39:29.688 --> 39:31.388
Thanks.

39:31.436 --> 39:32.969
Thank you for saving me.

39:33.487 --> 39:35.257
You're like my knight in
shining armor right now.

39:35.282 --> 39:37.132
Well, when you find someone

39:37.157 --> 39:39.671
who melts the iceberg
that is your heart,

39:39.863 --> 39:41.303
you save 'em right back because

39:41.328 --> 39:42.661
you want tomorrow to
start today forever.

39:42.663 --> 39:43.632
Okay, buddy, let's go.

39:43.657 --> 39:44.923
Yeah, all right.

39:45.835 --> 39:48.405
Rebecca, wait. Paula called.
You cannot leave.

39:48.430 --> 39:50.139
Uh, just, uh, run. Just go
around her. It's fine.

39:50.164 --> 39:51.903
- What?
- Just go around her. Just... Oh...

39:51.905 --> 39:53.238
- No, I'm serious. Stop.
- Giddy-up! Giddy-up, horsey.

39:53.240 --> 39:54.858
- Okay, well, uh, she's in my way now.
- You cannot go.

39:54.883 --> 39:56.350
Rebecca, wait.

39:56.407 --> 39:57.719
We need to talk about this.
