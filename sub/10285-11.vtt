WEBVTT

00:05.506 --> 00:06.707
Previously on ER:

00:06.740 --> 00:09.777
Until further notice,
the acting chief
of the ER will be

00:09.810 --> 00:12.613
Dr. Wexler.
What?

00:12.646 --> 00:15.416
You'll get your shot.
Really?

00:15.449 --> 00:17.251
How long do I have to wait?

00:17.285 --> 00:18.652
You seen Skye?
I need to take
a leave of absence.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.321
I figured she's
the one to talk to.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.123
Someday, you're going
to meet the right girl,

00:22.156 --> 00:23.457
you're going to fall in love,
and your first time

00:23.491 --> 00:24.592
is going to be special.

00:24.625 --> 00:25.659
Ethan McInerney,
and you are?

00:25.693 --> 00:27.261
Sam Taggart.

00:27.295 --> 00:29.063
I'm feeling real invisible
around here.

00:29.097 --> 00:30.531
Be proactive.

00:30.564 --> 00:32.400
Show Anspaugh
and the administration

00:32.433 --> 00:33.767
you can make
their lives easier.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.343
So we've got Bulls games
to go to,

00:42.376 --> 00:45.146
and deep dish pizza
to eat at Arnie's.

00:45.179 --> 00:47.815
Hey, they've got some cool band
playing at Climax Lounge, too.

00:47.848 --> 00:50.751
How about the hospital lounge?

00:55.123 --> 00:56.824
I have to go to work today.

00:56.857 --> 00:58.526
Oh, well, I can
come with you.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.561
And we can hit the
streets after that.

01:00.594 --> 01:02.130
Listen, Jaspreet,
that sounds fun,

01:02.163 --> 01:04.697
but I don't party
when I'm working.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.434
What about
last night?

01:06.467 --> 01:09.237
Last night
was an exception.

01:09.270 --> 01:11.139
Yeah. Well, there's
going to be plenty of those

01:11.139 --> 01:13.374
because, while I'm here,
we're going to be partying.

01:13.407 --> 01:14.875
And how long
is that anyway?

01:14.908 --> 01:16.744
Just until my parents
give up on the idea

01:16.777 --> 01:18.612
of me marrying Chemmel Narayan.

01:18.646 --> 01:20.148
Who's that?

01:20.148 --> 01:21.382
Some creepy doctor that my dad

01:21.415 --> 01:23.284
actually wants me
to procreate with.

01:23.317 --> 01:26.787
Honestly, he's got
a bigger muffin top
than Humpty Dumpty,

01:26.820 --> 01:28.156
and every time I even think
about shagging him,

01:28.156 --> 01:30.191
I get throw-up in my mouth.

01:30.224 --> 01:32.360
Your dad wants you to have
an arranged marriage?

01:32.393 --> 01:33.627
I thought he was cool.

01:33.661 --> 01:35.896
He's a bloody wanker!

01:35.929 --> 01:37.765
He tries to act
like the family man,

01:37.798 --> 01:39.367
but the truth is he has

01:39.400 --> 01:42.470
some chick half his age
living in Notting Hill.

01:42.503 --> 01:45.506
Jaspreet, your parents don't
know you're here, do they?

01:45.539 --> 01:49.877
I'm sure American Express
will tell them.

01:49.910 --> 01:51.412
Hey, come on, everybody!
Keep it going!

01:51.445 --> 01:54.182
We're almost there.
Keep it going.

01:54.215 --> 01:56.350
Come on, Sam. You're doing good.

01:56.384 --> 01:57.551
Come on.

01:57.585 --> 01:59.387
I was at mile five.

01:59.420 --> 02:01.255
This is a
little too much.

02:01.289 --> 02:03.591
You got to run on your toes.

02:03.624 --> 02:06.227
You're landing on the
side of your feet.

02:06.260 --> 02:07.561
Are you seeing
stars yet?

02:07.595 --> 02:09.530
No. I'm seeing a bench.

02:09.562 --> 02:11.232
A bench with a pillow!

02:11.265 --> 02:13.567
Great job, everybody.
Same drill tomorrow,

02:13.601 --> 02:15.736
5:00 a.m. Next week,
we add the bicycle.

02:15.769 --> 02:18.539
No. No on
the bicycle.

02:18.572 --> 02:20.674
This is triathlon training, Sam.

02:20.708 --> 02:22.610
Bike, swim, run.

02:22.643 --> 02:25.746
How about shower,
drink, nap?

02:25.779 --> 02:26.914
That's more
my speed.

02:26.947 --> 02:28.549
Sam, you okay?

02:28.582 --> 02:30.284
I need a gurney.

02:30.318 --> 02:31.319
All right. I'll tell them
to send one out for you.

02:31.352 --> 02:32.720
And some O2!

02:32.753 --> 02:34.222
Don't hold back.

02:34.222 --> 02:35.556
Tell them everything
you ever implemented--

02:35.589 --> 02:36.957
document compliance,
medication reconciliation.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.859
Think I should mention
when I went to Africa?

02:38.892 --> 02:41.762
Of course. And make sure
you tell them how good
you are in bed, too.

02:41.795 --> 02:42.863
I should have worn
that other suit.

02:42.896 --> 02:44.365
This one's fine.

02:44.398 --> 02:45.766
These pants wrinkly?

02:45.799 --> 02:47.235
All right,
I'm wigging out.

02:47.235 --> 02:48.736
I don't know why
I'm wigging out.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.238
You are going to rock this.
I know it.

02:50.238 --> 02:51.739
Hey Pratt,
can you give me a hand?

02:51.772 --> 02:52.773
Nope. I got a meeting
with Anspaugh.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.808
Get Skye.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.477
This is Beth Ackerman, 22.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.878
Fell down the escalator
at Bloomingdale's.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.813
It was 50% off suede boots.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.249
I'm Dr. Gates.
You in any pain?

03:01.282 --> 03:02.716
Yeah. My ankle's killing me.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.485
Deformity and
point tenderness

03:04.518 --> 03:05.986
over the
distal tib fib.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.455
She said her stomach hurts, too.

03:07.488 --> 03:08.522
We'll take
a look at that.

03:08.556 --> 03:10.324
She took a pretty good fall.

03:10.358 --> 03:12.493
I didn't break that glass vase
for my mom, did I?

03:12.526 --> 03:14.362
Sam, you're running
a little late here.

03:14.395 --> 03:16.664
I'll be ready in a minute.

03:16.697 --> 03:17.865
You okay?
Oh, she's fine.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.767
Yeah? You're
fine, right?

03:19.800 --> 03:21.535
Shut up.

03:21.569 --> 03:23.737
And the truth is,
I'm not some Ivy League import.

03:23.771 --> 03:26.474
I trained here as
a med student and a resident,

03:26.507 --> 03:28.776
and I know that ER better
than any other candidate.

03:28.809 --> 03:32.480
I've been nominated for
a med school teaching award.

03:32.513 --> 03:35.516
I'm efficient,
and I understand the need

03:35.549 --> 03:37.851
to balance teaching
with productivity.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.387
And I'm the fastest
attending on the floor,

03:39.420 --> 03:40.754
and I have the records
to prove it.

03:40.788 --> 03:43.023
What else would you want
in a chief?

03:43.056 --> 03:44.825
Experience.

03:44.858 --> 03:46.727
Come on. You've
hired experience,

03:46.760 --> 03:49.029
and all you got out of it
was a mental breakdown,

03:49.062 --> 03:51.399
and another guy who
didn't last three months.

03:51.432 --> 03:53.667
I love your chutzpah.

03:53.701 --> 03:55.569
I've told you this,

03:55.603 --> 03:56.837
but I don't see it.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.372
You don't see what?

03:58.406 --> 04:01.609
Some people are leaders,
Dr. Pratt.

04:01.642 --> 04:03.444
Some people aren't.

04:03.477 --> 04:04.778
Dr. Anspaugh, with all due
respect, I've been here...

04:04.812 --> 04:06.380
I've talked with
your supervisors.

04:06.414 --> 04:09.317
Yes, Kovac told you to go
to Africa, and you did it.

04:09.317 --> 04:10.918
Kovac also told you
what to change in the ER.

04:10.951 --> 04:12.486
You did that, too.

04:12.520 --> 04:15.589
But, without prompting,
what have you done here?

04:15.623 --> 04:17.024
In order for me
to overlook all

04:17.057 --> 04:18.892
these other candidates,
I would have to see

04:18.926 --> 04:20.827
that you are
an undeniable choice,

04:20.861 --> 04:22.930
and I'm not convinced.

04:24.832 --> 04:26.934
Then maybe I shouldn't
be here at all.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.836
Dr. Pratt.
No. I've been busting

04:28.869 --> 04:30.838
my butt.
Now, if you don't see that,

04:30.871 --> 04:32.673
why should
I waste my time here?

04:32.706 --> 04:34.942
So you're going to give up
if you don't get this?

04:34.975 --> 04:38.879
No. I'm going to go somewhere
I'm respected,

04:38.912 --> 04:42.683
and my efforts
aren't in vain.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.952
Consider this
my two weeks' notice.

04:46.000 --> 04:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:53.494 --> 04:55.062
I think you're overreacting.

04:55.095 --> 04:56.530
They're so hung up
on sticking to
the status quo.

04:56.564 --> 04:57.898
Why spend
another day here?

04:57.931 --> 04:59.367
This is your family.

04:59.367 --> 05:00.668
No. My Aunt
Ellen's family.

05:00.701 --> 05:02.102
This is business.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.837
Look, Morris, I love you guys,

05:03.871 --> 05:05.873
I really do,
but this isn't right.

05:05.906 --> 05:07.107
What happened?

05:07.140 --> 05:08.376
Your people getting
oppressed again?

05:08.409 --> 05:09.677
Shut up, Frank.

05:09.710 --> 05:10.611
They didn't say
you'll never get it.

05:10.644 --> 05:11.545
They just said not now.

05:11.579 --> 05:12.813
You not still thinking

05:12.846 --> 05:14.382
Anspaugh's going
to make you chief?

05:14.415 --> 05:15.849
If I leave now, and
jam at another hospital,

05:15.883 --> 05:17.050
he'll change his mind.

05:17.084 --> 05:18.386
And then what?
You'll come back?

05:18.386 --> 05:19.720
Hell, no.
Fight the power!

05:19.753 --> 05:21.555
Shut up, Frank.

05:21.589 --> 05:23.457
Dr. Pratt, can you jump on this?
Yeah.

05:23.491 --> 05:25.025
Eight-year-old, head lac.
Seems altered.

05:25.058 --> 05:26.527
And you are?

05:26.560 --> 05:27.861
Teacher's aide.
He fell in gym class.

05:27.895 --> 05:29.096
Did he pass out?

05:29.129 --> 05:30.598
I wasn't there.

05:30.631 --> 05:31.932
They just told me
to bring him in.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.000
Hey, little man,
I'm Dr. Pratt.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.635
What's your name?

05:34.668 --> 05:36.069
My head hurts.
We're going to get you

05:36.103 --> 05:38.105
checked out.
Exam three. Come on.

05:38.138 --> 05:39.407
What labs do you want?

05:39.440 --> 05:41.409
CBC for a baseline.

05:41.409 --> 05:43.143
We were leaving the store
when she fell.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.445
She wanted me
to take her home,

05:44.478 --> 05:45.479
but she was in too much pain.

05:45.513 --> 05:46.480
Where do you live?

05:46.514 --> 05:47.915
In Harvey. Jack got us

05:47.948 --> 05:49.417
a weekend special
at the Marriott.

05:49.450 --> 05:50.951
We saw Jersey Boys
last night,

05:50.984 --> 05:52.786
capped it off
with a couple of martinis.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.422
Six, to be exact.

05:54.422 --> 05:56.457
Sounds like fun.
Special occasion?

05:56.490 --> 05:58.025
Beth, can you take
a deep breath for me?

05:58.058 --> 05:59.693
She got back from a tour
in Iraq two weeks ago.

05:59.727 --> 06:01.762
How long were you there?

06:01.795 --> 06:05.933
13 months.
Going back in six weeks.

06:05.966 --> 06:08.602
You military, too?

06:08.636 --> 06:11.004
Marines. After 9/11,
I wanted to go to Iraq,

06:11.038 --> 06:12.072
but they sent
me to Guam.

06:12.105 --> 06:13.073
What's happening in Guam?

06:13.106 --> 06:14.708
Not enough.

06:14.742 --> 06:15.843
Any allergies?

06:15.876 --> 06:17.478
Walnuts. That's about it.

06:17.511 --> 06:21.615
Okay, a little stick here.

06:21.649 --> 06:24.552
You're looking better
than the last time I saw you.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.554
I was a little winded.

06:26.587 --> 06:29.790
Winded? You were sucking air
like a dry guppy.

06:29.823 --> 06:30.658
Ooh!

06:32.660 --> 06:35.128
She has some tenderness
in the left lower quadrant.

06:35.162 --> 06:38.165
Follow serial exams, and make
sure Trauma takes a look.

06:38.198 --> 06:39.700
Okay.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.069
I need you to go to Admit

06:42.102 --> 06:44.071
and fill out some paperwork
for registration.

06:44.104 --> 06:46.039
No problem.
Honey, I'll be right back, okay?

06:46.073 --> 06:48.075
I'm not going anywhere.

06:50.110 --> 06:52.079
The ICON's positive.

06:52.112 --> 06:53.881
What does that mean?

06:53.914 --> 06:57.084
You're pregnant.

06:58.151 --> 07:01.655
One, two, supermodel!

07:03.724 --> 07:05.626
Oh, that's fabulous!

07:05.659 --> 07:07.027
Neela's, like, my hero.

07:07.060 --> 07:08.696
She moved to America,

07:08.729 --> 07:10.498
and she took it
by the balls
and worked it.

07:10.531 --> 07:12.633
Oh, she does have a way.

07:12.666 --> 07:13.901
I mean, the rest
of our family,

07:13.934 --> 07:15.836
they have a stick
up their bottoms,

07:15.869 --> 07:18.506
but Neela said bollocks
to tradition, and she moved
to the States.

07:18.506 --> 07:20.007
She's, like,
our very own Mick Jagger.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.609
Oh, I don't know.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.043
I think of her as more
of a backup singer.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.177
You know, like a Pip--

07:24.211 --> 07:24.978
I being Gladys,
she being a Pip.

07:25.012 --> 07:26.146
Hi. Sorry.

07:26.179 --> 07:27.781
Radiology
wanted me to stay

07:27.815 --> 07:29.116
in CT with our
diverticulitis guy.

07:29.149 --> 07:30.651
Uh-huh.

07:30.684 --> 07:32.019
We don't handhold
here, Harold.

07:32.052 --> 07:34.121
Next time, let Radiology
do their own job.

07:34.154 --> 07:36.957
Harold, uh, I'd like you
to meet my cousin Jaspreet.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.526
Hi...

07:38.526 --> 07:39.560
I'm, uh...

07:39.593 --> 07:40.193
Harold.
You're Harold.

07:40.227 --> 07:41.261
Right, Harold.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.596
Hey, some people call me
Jazz.

07:42.630 --> 07:43.731
I love jazz.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.899
Uh, Miles Davis,
Dizzy Gillespie.

07:45.933 --> 07:47.535
Gillespie.

07:47.535 --> 07:49.970
Green Mill's the place
for that here.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.539
Oh, well,
we should go sometime.

07:51.539 --> 07:52.640
Really?

07:52.673 --> 07:54.041
(wheezing):
So, you and...

07:54.074 --> 07:55.242
(wheezing):
and me...

07:55.275 --> 07:56.810
(wheezing)

07:56.844 --> 07:58.111
What's wrong with this guy?

07:58.145 --> 08:00.614
He's having an
asthma attack.

08:00.648 --> 08:02.049
Somebody get this kid
an inhaler!

08:02.082 --> 08:04.117
You're gonna feel a little bit
of a sting here.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.119
Ow!

08:06.153 --> 08:08.556
This is the numbing shot
for your stitches.

08:08.556 --> 08:10.290
It hurts.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.259
It'll get easier after this.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.261
Where do you think
you'll go?

08:14.294 --> 08:16.263
Call Northwestern.

08:16.296 --> 08:17.931
They wanted me once.

08:17.965 --> 08:19.232
Maybe they'll want me again.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.304
Feel that?

08:24.337 --> 08:26.106
Feel what?

08:26.139 --> 08:27.641
Good.

08:27.675 --> 08:29.577
I'll start stitching you up now,
okay?

08:29.610 --> 08:32.279
How many will I get?

08:32.312 --> 08:34.081
About five.

08:34.114 --> 08:35.683
Can you make it six?

08:35.716 --> 08:37.585
I want to have one more
than my friend Lucas.

08:37.585 --> 08:39.852
All right,
I'll see what I can do.

08:39.886 --> 08:41.922
CT's backed up.

08:41.955 --> 08:43.791
They said to call back
in a half hour.

08:43.823 --> 08:46.326
This place needs
a second scanner.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.895
Carlos, you remember
how this happened?

08:47.928 --> 08:49.597
I don't know.

08:49.597 --> 08:51.264
I was playing kickball
and fell.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.702
Were you feeling sick today?

08:54.735 --> 08:56.169
No.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.605
Are you taking any medicine?

08:57.638 --> 09:00.808
Epzicom, didanosine and Kaletra.

09:02.209 --> 09:05.613
Those medicines are for HIV.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.214
How long has your asthma
been acting up anyway?

09:07.247 --> 09:09.783
I think it happened because
of my psychosexual stress.

09:09.817 --> 09:11.251
Psychosexual what?

09:11.284 --> 09:14.354
It's rare. They don't teach it
in med school.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.123
So, she's single?
She ran away from an
arranged marriage.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.626
Sweet.
Harold.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.861
She's not for you.
She's a sex-crazed maniac.

09:23.631 --> 09:25.933
Okay, come on,
enough with the babying.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.267
Neela and I have
a rectal abscess,

09:27.300 --> 09:28.836
an infected picc line,

09:28.869 --> 09:30.638
and a woman versus escalator
calling our names.

09:30.671 --> 09:31.672
Let's go.
Can I do the I and D?

09:31.705 --> 09:32.940
No. No.
Sure.

09:32.973 --> 09:34.708
Neela and I are gonna
cover the ER today.

09:34.742 --> 09:36.710
I got a lot of consults
piling up and just

09:36.744 --> 09:38.712
want to keep the team
lean and mean.
Well, what should I do?

09:38.746 --> 09:41.314
You can deflate
your little balloon

09:41.348 --> 09:42.816
and then take Bollywood
out there for a tour.

09:42.850 --> 09:44.785
(sighs)

09:44.818 --> 09:48.321
Okay,
this is the uterus,

09:48.355 --> 09:49.957
and there's the baby.

09:49.990 --> 09:52.092
Are you sure?

09:52.125 --> 09:54.662
Mm-hmm, look, there's
the heartbeat right there.

09:54.695 --> 09:56.797
Hey,

09:56.830 --> 09:59.199
I called your sister and told
her everything's gonna be okay.

10:01.134 --> 10:03.003
What's up?
What are they doing?

10:03.036 --> 10:04.805
An ultrasound.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.640
Why? What's
going on?

10:07.340 --> 10:10.077
I'm pregnant.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.781
You're what?

10:14.715 --> 10:17.017
Oh, my God!

10:17.050 --> 10:19.352
We're pregnant!

10:19.386 --> 10:20.854
Yeah, okay.

10:20.888 --> 10:23.356
Adorable baby,
I can tell already.
Oh.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.358
What, are these the...
are these the arms right there?

10:25.392 --> 10:28.662
Yeah, there's the fingers,
and toes are starting to form

10:28.696 --> 10:29.429
so it's about

10:29.462 --> 10:30.931
eight weeks old.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.399
Eight weeks?
Mm-hmm.

10:32.432 --> 10:33.834
At least.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.769
The OB will do
a formal ultrasound,

10:35.803 --> 10:38.138
give you a more
accurate estimate.

10:44.111 --> 10:45.445
Trauma's here.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.280
Is the escalator fall
Beth Ackerman?

10:50.350 --> 10:52.853
Hello, I'm Dr. Rasgotra
from Surgery.

10:52.886 --> 10:54.722
Does anything hurt?

10:56.289 --> 10:57.925
DEJESUS:
Sounds like
he wants you to be

10:57.958 --> 10:59.459
more proactive
with your own ideas.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.828
Yeah, well, I'll take my ideas
to another hospital,

11:00.861 --> 11:02.095
thank you very much.

11:02.129 --> 11:03.430
You know, I never
liked Anspaugh.

11:03.463 --> 11:05.766
If you need help looking,
I can make some calls.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.901
You know, if I can't
find a job fast enough,

11:07.935 --> 11:10.070
I might need a sugar mama
to take care of me.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.739
Maybe we can
work something out.

11:11.772 --> 11:13.006
I can cook and clean.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.942
I'll take that
into consideration.

11:14.975 --> 11:16.376
Hey, Dawn, did Carlos Moore's
mom get here yet?

11:16.409 --> 11:17.878
I left a message.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.079
Her phone keeps going
to voice mail.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.814
Try it again.

11:20.848 --> 11:22.850
She needs to know
her kid is here.
Just because

11:22.883 --> 11:24.952
a boy steps to me doesn't mean
I'm gonna tell him my status.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.119
That is not right.

11:26.153 --> 11:27.855
What would you do, Sydney?

11:27.888 --> 11:29.256
You got to be upfront.
Tell him what's up.

11:29.289 --> 11:31.058
Because he asked
for your number?

11:31.091 --> 11:32.392
This is about being honest.

11:32.425 --> 11:34.294
Well, damn,
if that's the case,

11:34.327 --> 11:36.997
I'll be telling people all day
that I'm HIV-positive.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.266
(chuckling)

11:39.299 --> 11:41.101
You know, the truth is,
you're both right.

11:41.134 --> 11:42.870
It is important
to be honest.

11:42.903 --> 11:45.505
But every guy you meet doesn't
need to know your status.

11:45.538 --> 11:48.175
However, men you plan
to be intimate with

11:48.208 --> 11:49.777
do need to know.

11:49.810 --> 11:51.879
Even if he just wants
to kiss you?

11:51.912 --> 11:53.881
Jeanie, it's Carlos.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.082
What?
They just called.

11:55.115 --> 11:56.149
He's at County.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.087
Ladies, I need
to cut this short.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.354
Miss Boulet, is there
anything we can do?

12:01.388 --> 12:02.923
No, thanks, sweetie.

12:02.956 --> 12:04.224
I left Sydney's
prescription on my desk.

12:04.257 --> 12:05.292
No problem, I got it.

12:08.295 --> 12:09.396
We got a 52-year-old
diabetic

12:09.429 --> 12:10.263
with a non-healing ulcer
on the foot.

12:10.297 --> 12:11.865
What's his glucose?

12:11.899 --> 12:15.035
89. Last insulin
was two hours ago.
Excuse me.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.136
Is triage still in here?

12:16.169 --> 12:17.470
Yeah, check in
at the desk.

12:20.941 --> 12:23.176
Excuse me, my kid was
brought in about an hour ago.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.278
You have to sign in.
His name's Carlos Moore.
He fell during gym.

12:25.312 --> 12:26.980
I just need to know
what room he's in.

12:27.014 --> 12:28.415
Have a seat. I'll be
with you in a few minutes.

12:28.448 --> 12:30.951
This guy needs a foot
series and a CBC.

12:30.984 --> 12:32.352
Please just look it up for me.

12:34.054 --> 12:35.088
Hey.

12:35.122 --> 12:36.156
Hey, get back...!

12:36.189 --> 12:37.224
Put him in sutures.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.859
What room is Carlos Moore in?

12:38.892 --> 12:40.193
Carlos Moore...

12:40.227 --> 12:41.829
Uh, ma'am,
you need to sign in.

12:41.862 --> 12:42.963
Jeanie?
Hey, Chuny.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.331
What are you doing here?

12:44.364 --> 12:45.933
It's Carlos.
He fell during gym.

12:45.966 --> 12:48.135
You know her?
Yeah, she used
to work here.

12:48.168 --> 12:50.370
How are you?
I'm good. I'm good.

12:50.403 --> 12:51.905
Will you help me
find him?
Yeah.

12:51.939 --> 12:53.406
Exam 3.
He's Dr. Pratt's case.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.407
Come on,
I'll show you.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.243
The ER has
changed a bit.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.845
How have you been?
I've been good.

12:57.878 --> 12:58.846
You look the same.

12:58.879 --> 13:00.113
Oh, you look great, too.

13:00.147 --> 13:01.581
Hey, there you are.

13:01.614 --> 13:02.415
Hey.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.017
You okay?

13:04.051 --> 13:06.053
Were you spacing out
during kickball again?

13:06.086 --> 13:07.354
I guess, it's so boring.

13:07.387 --> 13:08.355
Yeah, I know.

13:08.388 --> 13:09.156
Doesn't look too bad.

13:09.189 --> 13:10.257
Jeanie Boulet.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.258
She's Carlos' mom.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.392
She was a PA on staff.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.261
Oh, good,
I'm Dr. Pratt.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.496
We're about to take him up
to get a head CT right now.

13:16.529 --> 13:18.098
Really,
he needs a CT?
Blunt head trauma,

13:18.131 --> 13:19.432
possible loss of
consciousness.
Possible?

13:19.466 --> 13:20.500
Doesn't the school know?

13:20.533 --> 13:22.169
Well, the aide wasn't sure.

13:22.202 --> 13:24.104
And I want to play it safe
and get the scan anyway.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.939
Is Dr. Weaver here?

13:25.973 --> 13:27.274
I know her.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.876
No, she doesn't
work here anymore.

13:28.876 --> 13:30.543
Carlos is a bit more
complicated than other kids.

13:30.577 --> 13:33.180
Yeah, I know, he
told me about the HIV.

13:33.213 --> 13:35.082
No offense, but I'd feel better

13:35.115 --> 13:36.316
with the most senior person
taking care of him.

13:36.349 --> 13:38.151
He hit his head.

13:38.185 --> 13:40.487
And I have a lot of experience
managing head trauma.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.555
I'm not trying to be
disrespectful,

13:42.589 --> 13:45.058
but would it be possible for me
to speak to your attending?

13:46.927 --> 13:49.029
Ma'am, I am the attending.

13:50.430 --> 13:51.564
Hemoglobin's
stable at 15.2.

13:51.598 --> 13:52.599
I'm not getting
anything here.

13:52.632 --> 13:54.167
Beth, your fractured bones

13:54.201 --> 13:55.969
are blocking the blood
flow to your foot.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.504
I'm gonna need to try and
realign them now, okay?

13:57.537 --> 13:59.072
Whatever.

13:59.106 --> 14:00.173
I just don't get it.

14:00.207 --> 14:01.474
Jack, we'll talk about this

14:01.508 --> 14:02.475
when it's over.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.311
Propofol is kicking in.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.146
Good sats.
All right, let's
stabilize posteriorly.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.280
Okay, ready?

14:07.314 --> 14:09.316
On three.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.918
One...

14:10.918 --> 14:12.619
two...

14:12.652 --> 14:14.354
three.
Whoa!

14:14.387 --> 14:15.956
Whoa, what's going on,
Dr. Rasgotra?

14:15.989 --> 14:17.190
Displaced tib fib.

14:17.224 --> 14:19.659
You may be my favorite
trauma surgeon,

14:19.692 --> 14:22.329
but I don't recall you
having any orthopedic training.
Well, no.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.197
Typically, the ER waits
for the ortho team

14:24.231 --> 14:26.199
before reducing
unstable fractures.

14:26.233 --> 14:27.200
She had no choice.

14:27.234 --> 14:28.468
We lost the dorsalis pulse.

14:30.537 --> 14:33.073
And now it's back.

14:33.106 --> 14:34.341
Really?

14:38.178 --> 14:41.514
Wow, you must have
some set of hands, girl.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.984
All right, call us when
you got post-reduction film.

14:44.017 --> 14:44.952
Let's go. We got
a femur in 2.
I would really

14:44.952 --> 14:46.319
prefer an MRI.

14:46.353 --> 14:48.488
A CT will give us
the information we need.

14:48.521 --> 14:49.957
Maybe, but it
involves radiation.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.358
He doesn't need
that right now.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.226
An MRI takes much longer,

14:53.260 --> 14:54.494
and it's not as good
for finding a traumatic bleed.

14:54.527 --> 14:56.263
It's gonna be okay.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.598
I know, honey.

14:58.631 --> 15:00.467
I just want to do
the right thing.
This is the right thing.

15:02.169 --> 15:03.303
We can do the CT

15:03.336 --> 15:05.305
quickly and without sedation.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.340
And if you want to
stay in the room,
you have to wear

15:07.374 --> 15:08.575
one of these lead aprons.

15:08.608 --> 15:10.610
If not, you can wait
in the control room.

15:10.643 --> 15:13.580
I'm not going anywhere.

15:13.613 --> 15:15.415
This isn't gonna hurt.

15:15.448 --> 15:16.683
I know.

15:19.552 --> 15:20.687
You ready, Carlos?

15:27.227 --> 15:28.628
I'll be right here.

15:28.661 --> 15:30.430
It'll be over
before you know it.

15:37.237 --> 15:39.372
That reduction was impressive.

15:39.406 --> 15:41.608
Let's not congratulate ourselves
until we see the film.

15:43.343 --> 15:44.744
(murmurs):
Is it over?

15:44.777 --> 15:46.446
Your bones are
back in place.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.548
We need to wrap your splint
and repeat the X-ray.

15:48.581 --> 15:50.017
How do you feel?

15:53.586 --> 15:54.587
I'm okay.

15:54.621 --> 15:57.124
Who is he?

15:58.291 --> 16:00.360
It's not what you think.

16:00.393 --> 16:02.762
Was it someone
in your squad?

16:02.795 --> 16:04.464
Was he an officer?

16:04.497 --> 16:07.167
Was it a journalist?

16:07.200 --> 16:08.768
The guy you wrote me about?

16:08.801 --> 16:11.038
Now's really not
the time for this, man.
No, Jack.

16:11.071 --> 16:13.540
Explain to me how you've been
home for two weeks

16:13.573 --> 16:15.042
and you're two months pregnant!

16:24.484 --> 16:26.386
Because I was raped.

16:28.521 --> 16:31.491
(sobbing)

16:33.460 --> 16:35.762
Kyle...

16:35.795 --> 16:38.398
Kyle Peterson raped me.

16:42.169 --> 16:44.404
Your sergeant?

16:46.573 --> 16:48.108
You were laughing with him

16:48.141 --> 16:49.809
when you got off the plane,
I saw you.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.179
He did it, Jack.

16:52.212 --> 16:53.346
You're lying.

16:53.380 --> 16:54.747
It's true.

16:54.781 --> 16:56.416
You need
to stay still.
You're covering

16:56.449 --> 16:57.817
because you
screwed somebody.

16:57.850 --> 16:58.818
You know what?
Why don't you go outside.

16:58.851 --> 16:59.819
Hey, get off of me!

16:59.852 --> 17:01.588
(screams)

17:01.621 --> 17:02.522
Jack!

17:10.130 --> 17:11.131
I'd wait a year or so.

17:11.164 --> 17:12.432
Jobs are tight out there.

17:12.464 --> 17:13.599
No, the housing
market's tight.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.468
People always
need doctors.

17:15.502 --> 17:18.637
Hey, I'd pimp my dog
if it'll get you to stay.

17:18.671 --> 17:20.307
Why don't you pimp a few charts
and clear the board.

17:20.339 --> 17:21.708
We're packed.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.310
You should put Abby
back on the schedule.

17:23.343 --> 17:24.611
She's taking
some personal time.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.313
Still?
It's been weeks now.

17:26.346 --> 17:27.847
So what?
She'll come back
when she's back.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.150
I saw your nephrotic
syndrome patient.

17:30.183 --> 17:32.585
Consult's
on the chart.
Thank you, Dr. Daniels.

17:32.619 --> 17:34.121
Oh, hey.
Hey, hey.

17:34.154 --> 17:35.322
How'd he do?

17:35.355 --> 17:36.556
He handled it like a champ.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.625
Oh, good.
Well, I'll come find you

17:38.658 --> 17:39.692
as soon as I get
the results.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.497
Pratt, it's Michael Grant
from Northwestern, line 2.

17:44.531 --> 17:45.498
Hey.
Whoa, whoa.

17:45.532 --> 17:46.766
You called already?

17:46.799 --> 17:47.767
You snooze, you lose.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.302
Hello?

17:49.336 --> 17:50.803
I'll take the neck
in Trauma.

17:50.837 --> 17:52.139
You talk some sense
into him.

17:52.172 --> 17:54.207
ZELINSKY:
Oh, and this is the desk.

17:54.241 --> 17:55.442
It's kind of like
the epicenter where...

17:55.475 --> 17:57.144
Where...

17:57.177 --> 17:59.446
senior attendings like myself
create the action.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.548
More like the chaos.
Hi.

18:01.581 --> 18:02.749
Hi.

18:02.782 --> 18:04.617
I'm Jaspreet, Neela's cousin.

18:04.651 --> 18:07.154
Oh. I'm Archie Morris,
Neela's friend.

18:07.187 --> 18:08.788
Not to be confused
with "boyfriend"

18:08.821 --> 18:10.757
because we never dated
if you know what I'm saying.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.659
Why wouldn't I know
what you're saying?
Okay,

18:12.692 --> 18:15.362
Dr. Morris, Jaspreet and I
need to go finish the tour.

18:15.395 --> 18:16.796
Oh, uh, tour?

18:16.829 --> 18:19.199
Tour, well, where has
young Henry taken you?

18:19.232 --> 18:20.233
It's Harold.
Whatever.

18:20.267 --> 18:21.668
Well, we went to the OR

18:21.701 --> 18:24.271
and saw this guy carrying
a heart in an ice chest.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.538
It was so cool.
And then we saw

18:25.572 --> 18:26.873
this awesome MRI scan

18:26.906 --> 18:28.275
and saw pictures
of this chick's brain.

18:28.308 --> 18:29.776
Then we went

18:29.809 --> 18:31.311
to the morgue
and saw this dead body.

18:31.344 --> 18:32.745
And this thing was dead.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.547
As in dead-dead.
Wow.

18:34.581 --> 18:35.915
Did he take you
to the trauma room?

18:35.948 --> 18:38.751
Where senior attendings
like myself save lives?

18:38.785 --> 18:39.786
No.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.221
But I'd love to see that.

18:41.254 --> 18:42.322
Would you?

18:42.355 --> 18:43.323
My pleasure.

18:43.356 --> 18:44.691
Wait.
Excuse me.

18:44.724 --> 18:45.392
Wait. But...

18:45.425 --> 18:47.194
But, uh...

18:47.194 --> 18:49.196
I haven't even taken you
to the pathology lab yet.

18:50.863 --> 18:55.568
I must've been asleep about
two hours when he came in.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.639
First I thought
we were being attacked.

19:01.208 --> 19:04.744
(sobs):
That's why he was there, but...

19:07.314 --> 19:09.749
Then he got on top of me and

19:09.782 --> 19:11.384
put his hand
over my mouth

19:11.418 --> 19:12.685
and told me
to be quiet.

19:12.719 --> 19:14.254
And I froze.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.756
Did you tell anyone?

19:16.789 --> 19:19.926
The next day we were
out on patrol

19:19.959 --> 19:21.628
looking for insurgents.

19:21.661 --> 19:22.962
What was I supposed to do,
file a complaint?

19:22.995 --> 19:25.398
I needed those guys
to have my back.

19:25.432 --> 19:26.899
Still, they should be punished.

19:26.933 --> 19:28.768
It's too late.

19:28.801 --> 19:30.870
I pretended like
it didn't happen.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.972
Just like Jack said,
I was laughing with him.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.742
Doesn't matter.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.844
I've been through it.

19:39.612 --> 19:41.948
Holding it in gives you nothing

19:41.981 --> 19:44.284
but nightmares
and panic attacks.

19:49.356 --> 19:52.525
I heard Jeanie Boulet
was in the house.

19:54.494 --> 19:55.595
Hi. Hi.
Look at you.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.697
You look great.
Oh, you do, too.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.766
Thanks.
You remember Carlos?

19:59.799 --> 20:02.835
You were this small
when we met.

20:02.869 --> 20:03.970
How you feeling?
Okay.

20:04.003 --> 20:05.272
I got a CT.

20:05.305 --> 20:07.640
About 45 minutes ago.

20:07.674 --> 20:09.509
Wonder if they processed
the films yet.

20:09.542 --> 20:10.510
Who was helping you?

20:10.543 --> 20:11.878
Dr. Pratt.

20:11.911 --> 20:14.681
Let's go find out
if the radiologist has them.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.316
Okay, I'll go with you.

20:16.349 --> 20:17.384
You all right?

20:19.952 --> 20:21.354
Be back in a few minutes.

20:25.558 --> 20:26.793
So what's going on?

20:26.826 --> 20:28.628
Are you still running
the same clinic?

20:28.661 --> 20:30.530
Two now-- one on
the South Side,
one on the North.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.832
How's Reggie?
Did he finally
make detective?

20:32.865 --> 20:34.301
Yeah, he sure did.

20:34.334 --> 20:35.968
We separated
two years ago.

20:36.002 --> 20:37.904
No, don't tell me that.

20:37.937 --> 20:39.606
He just... it was
too much for him.

20:39.639 --> 20:40.973
I'm at the clinic 24/7.

20:41.007 --> 20:42.509
So you're still close?

20:42.542 --> 20:43.576
Joint custody.

20:43.610 --> 20:44.811
It's good for all of us.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.479
Have you heard
from Doug and Carol?

20:46.513 --> 20:48.448
Oh, they are still
loving Seattle.

20:48.481 --> 20:50.483
Dr. Ross sent
a picture of the twins.

20:50.517 --> 20:53.019
They just started
third grade.
Wow.

20:53.052 --> 20:54.721
I keep saying
I'm gonna visit.

20:54.754 --> 20:55.688
And how's Carter?

20:55.722 --> 20:57.424
Is he still in Africa?

20:57.457 --> 20:59.726
I heard he might be coming home
for a visit in the spring.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.761
You know what?
I should have everybody over

21:01.794 --> 21:03.596
for gumbo and etouffee.
Do that.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.465
We'll get together
like the good old days.

21:05.498 --> 21:07.800
Has anyone seen Dr. Pratt?

21:07.834 --> 21:09.902
He's at the Jumbo Mart
having coffee.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.971
I was just hoping I could
get my son's CT results

21:12.004 --> 21:13.373
and get him home.

21:13.406 --> 21:15.342
I'll give them a call.

21:15.342 --> 21:16.876
Name's Carlos Moore.

21:21.648 --> 21:24.451
Line's busy.
They've been slow all day.

21:24.484 --> 21:25.685
I'll go upstairs and see what's

21:25.718 --> 21:26.686
taking so long.

21:26.719 --> 21:28.555
Thanks a lot.

21:28.588 --> 21:30.590
DANIELS:
I started making up
the schedule myself.

21:30.623 --> 21:34.026
Before I knew it, I was
arranging teaching conferences,

21:34.060 --> 21:35.862
reorganizing
the appointment grids.

21:35.895 --> 21:38.698
Yeah, well,
that's just great.

21:38.731 --> 21:39.899
But Anspaugh
doesn't believe in me.

21:39.932 --> 21:41.834
You heard it yourself.

21:41.868 --> 21:43.370
It's not about Anspaugh.

21:43.403 --> 21:44.904
It's about you.

21:44.937 --> 21:49.008
Make it so they
can't deny you this.

21:49.041 --> 21:52.879
Look, there's some physician
leadership programs over

21:52.912 --> 21:54.481
at U of C coming up
in about a month.

21:54.514 --> 21:55.848
They might give you
some ideas.

21:55.882 --> 21:57.049
And why would I have
to jump through hoops

21:57.083 --> 21:58.585
when Northwestern
already said

21:58.618 --> 22:01.087
they'd die to have
someone like me?

22:01.120 --> 22:02.522
You think you're just gonna

22:02.555 --> 22:03.956
walk in there
and run the place?

22:03.990 --> 22:05.625
The head of the
department is looking

22:05.658 --> 22:06.859
for someone to mentor
to replace him.

22:08.928 --> 22:10.963
He wants to meet tomorrow.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.432
You know, Dr. Pratt,

22:12.465 --> 22:14.767
when a fighter
gets knocked down,

22:14.801 --> 22:16.903
in the first round,

22:16.936 --> 22:18.505
he doesn't throw in the towel.

22:18.538 --> 22:19.906
I'm not throwing in the towel.

22:19.939 --> 22:21.508
I'm getting into
another ring.

22:21.541 --> 22:22.909
(cell phone ringing)

22:22.942 --> 22:24.110
Excuse me.

22:26.479 --> 22:27.447
Dr. Pratt.

22:27.480 --> 22:28.448
Yeah.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.985
Why is she up there?

22:33.019 --> 22:34.921
No.

22:34.954 --> 22:36.656
Yeah. Okay, thanks.

22:36.689 --> 22:39.459
Hey, I gotta take care of this.

22:39.492 --> 22:40.660
Dr. Pratt,
think about what I said.

22:42.061 --> 22:43.129
Having you run
this department--

22:43.162 --> 22:45.898
that would be phenomenal.

22:51.037 --> 22:52.038
Have you seen our
soldier's boyfriend?

22:52.071 --> 22:53.706
The guy who
body-slammed me?

22:53.740 --> 22:55.442
I'm not sending a
search party out for him.

22:55.475 --> 22:56.909
Yeah, you need
to toughen up.

22:56.943 --> 22:58.811
Maybe you should come running
with us in the mornings.

22:58.845 --> 22:59.812
I lift weights, Sam.

22:59.846 --> 23:01.047
I'm not into torture.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.049
So why are you doing
all this anyway?

23:03.082 --> 23:05.918
I don't know. I'm trying to get
out there a little bit more.

23:05.952 --> 23:07.520
I'm taking wine tasting, too.

23:07.554 --> 23:08.755
(chuckles)

23:08.788 --> 23:09.889
What's funny, Gates?

23:09.922 --> 23:11.524
Oh, I don't
know. Just

23:11.558 --> 23:13.893
remembering a dream
I had last night.

23:16.028 --> 23:17.163
Sam was in it.

23:18.565 --> 23:19.632
I was?

23:19.666 --> 23:20.800
What was I doing?

23:20.833 --> 23:22.034
Hey, Sam, have you
seen Dr. Wexler?

23:22.068 --> 23:23.470
Not in a while.

23:23.470 --> 23:24.804
Hey, what was I
doing, Gates?

23:24.837 --> 23:25.938
Hey! Hey!

23:25.972 --> 23:27.640
Are those my films?

23:27.674 --> 23:29.709
Yeah. I went to light
a fire under their butts.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.744
Yeah, you should
have paged me first.

23:31.778 --> 23:33.179
I was trying to help.
Well, that wasn't

23:33.212 --> 23:34.814
the way to do it.
Miss Boulet?

23:34.847 --> 23:36.883
Dr. Pratt, we
should talk first.
Yeah, later.

23:36.916 --> 23:37.884
But, Dr. Pratt...

23:37.917 --> 23:39.652
What is it?

23:42.855 --> 23:44.557
Uh...

23:44.591 --> 23:46.826
Do you mind if we go talk
in the doctors lounge?

23:46.859 --> 23:47.994
No, I-I've waited long enough.

23:48.027 --> 23:49.796
Just give me
the results.

23:51.731 --> 23:54.501
There's a lesion by the frontal
horn of the left ventricle.

23:54.501 --> 23:56.669
From the fall?

23:56.703 --> 24:00.973
It's contrast-enhancing
with surrounding edema.

24:01.007 --> 24:02.742
No, it's not from a head injury.

24:05.612 --> 24:06.746
Then what is it?

24:06.779 --> 24:08.848
There are a few possibilities.

24:08.881 --> 24:11.050
It could be toxoplasmosis.

24:11.083 --> 24:14.020
CNS lymphoma,
histoplasmosis.

24:19.626 --> 24:20.760
Meaning AIDS.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.734
My son has AIDS.

24:29.235 --> 24:30.537
I never would have
told her like that

24:30.537 --> 24:31.571
had you not
gone up there.

24:31.604 --> 24:32.238
You're blaming this on me?

24:32.271 --> 24:34.240
You went behind my back.

24:34.273 --> 24:36.543
You're acting like I slept
with your girlfriend.

24:36.543 --> 24:37.644
I was helping you out.

24:37.677 --> 24:38.811
I don't need your help.

24:38.845 --> 24:40.547
Had I gotten the
results myself,

24:40.547 --> 24:42.114
I would have pulled
into the family room.

24:42.148 --> 24:44.951
Or if you had taken a second
to talk to me first...

24:44.984 --> 24:47.219
Because of you, what should have
been a private conversation

24:47.253 --> 24:48.555
happened out here
on the floor.

24:48.588 --> 24:49.288
You know what, Dr. Pratt?

24:49.321 --> 24:50.222
You don't get it.

24:50.256 --> 24:51.991
What don't I get?

24:52.024 --> 24:53.560
That you're a micromanager
in complete denial?

24:53.560 --> 24:54.794
This should be a team.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.796
We shouldn't be
working autonomously.

24:56.829 --> 24:58.765
Please, give me a break,
okay? I came up

24:58.798 --> 24:59.966
on this team.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.701
Now, the next time
you're bored

25:01.734 --> 25:02.969
and you need
something to do,

25:03.002 --> 25:06.806
try treating a patient--
your own...

25:06.839 --> 25:08.575
Chief.

25:11.343 --> 25:14.280
He'd done so well for so long.

25:14.313 --> 25:17.684
Then, over the last year,
his CD4 counts dropped.

25:17.717 --> 25:19.586
They've changed
his retrovirals twice...

25:19.586 --> 25:20.887
(door opens)

25:20.920 --> 25:23.289
...because the virus
became resistant.

25:23.322 --> 25:25.825
HALEH:
Let's just see what
the doctors have planned.

25:25.858 --> 25:28.628
There are all types
of new treatments now.

25:28.661 --> 25:30.697
Haleh's right.

25:30.730 --> 25:32.999
Even if it means
Carlos has AIDS,

25:33.032 --> 25:35.101
survival has improved
over the last decade.

25:35.134 --> 25:36.603
Please don't lecture me.

25:39.972 --> 25:42.642
I'm HIV-positive.
I know all about it.

25:42.675 --> 25:44.644
But it's different
when it's your own kid.

25:44.677 --> 25:45.612
I know that.

25:52.752 --> 25:54.286
It's so surreal happening here.

25:58.090 --> 25:59.291
It's where I met Carlos.

26:01.894 --> 26:04.664
We decided to adopt him.

26:04.697 --> 26:05.698
We don't even know what

26:05.732 --> 26:07.199
this brain lesion is.

26:07.233 --> 26:09.201
If it's toxoplasmosis,

26:09.235 --> 26:10.637
he'll get better
with antibiotics.

26:10.637 --> 26:11.638
And if it's
a lymphoma?

26:11.638 --> 26:12.705
Then there's chemo.

26:12.739 --> 26:14.340
You know that doesn't work.

26:14.373 --> 26:16.843
If it's a lymphoma,
he's got months.

26:16.876 --> 26:18.645
Why don't we just find out
what it is first?

26:18.645 --> 26:20.913
How will we do that?

26:22.381 --> 26:24.250
There is no simple way.

26:26.385 --> 26:27.987
The only way
to know for sure

26:28.020 --> 26:29.321
is to do a biopsy.

26:33.125 --> 26:34.193
Cut into his brain.

26:34.226 --> 26:35.695
The neurosurgeon

26:35.728 --> 26:38.097
can do it stereotactically,
with a needle

26:38.130 --> 26:39.231
under CT guidance.

26:41.801 --> 26:42.935
I don't know.

26:45.404 --> 26:47.106
It's the best way.

26:47.139 --> 26:49.709
DAWN:
Miss Boulet?

26:49.742 --> 26:52.679
A Reggie Moore is here
to see you.

26:52.679 --> 26:53.680
That's Carlos's father.

26:53.680 --> 26:54.346
I got to go.

27:02.789 --> 27:04.691
Bam! You're out.

27:04.724 --> 27:05.324
Harold, what are you doing?

27:05.357 --> 27:06.358
Playing four square.

27:07.694 --> 27:08.394
Whoa!
Hey!

27:08.427 --> 27:09.762
Oh! Okay! All right!

27:09.796 --> 27:10.396
Let's keep it
moving, people.

27:10.429 --> 27:11.698
Go inside, guys!

27:11.731 --> 27:12.765
Game's over.

27:12.799 --> 27:14.400
What? They're not patients?

27:14.433 --> 27:16.135
I pulled them
from the waiting room.

27:16.168 --> 27:17.904
You whip that thing
at them one more time,

27:17.937 --> 27:19.271
I'll be sewing up
their head lacs.

27:19.305 --> 27:21.307
Get in.

27:21.340 --> 27:22.775
What?

27:22.809 --> 27:25.177
The box. Get in.

27:25.211 --> 27:26.078
Get in.

27:31.984 --> 27:33.085
What is your problem?

27:33.119 --> 27:35.021
Why are you so agitated?

27:35.054 --> 27:36.823
Morris stole my girl.

27:38.991 --> 27:40.026
Your girl?

27:40.893 --> 27:42.361
Jaspreet?

27:42.394 --> 27:44.831
Two guys have taken my women
in the past two months,

27:44.864 --> 27:46.165
and I'm sick of it.

27:46.198 --> 27:48.067
(sighs)
MORRIS:
Across the way,

27:48.100 --> 27:49.435
we have the Jumbo Mart.

27:49.468 --> 27:51.103
Down the street is Ike's,

27:51.137 --> 27:53.072
a very fine establishment,
and there's the El,

27:53.105 --> 27:54.473
which can take you
anywhere in the city.

27:54.506 --> 27:55.842
JASPREET:
That's so cool.

27:55.875 --> 27:57.443
Hey, Neela! Jaspreet
and I were gonna

27:57.476 --> 27:58.477
grab some drinks
after work.

27:58.510 --> 27:59.478
You down?

27:59.511 --> 28:00.479
Well, actually, I was...

28:00.512 --> 28:01.480
Yeah. We're in.

28:01.513 --> 28:02.448
Uh... double date.

28:04.884 --> 28:06.285
Be there.

28:09.088 --> 28:10.189
Howard, come
on. Let's go.

28:10.222 --> 28:11.157
Come on.

28:13.492 --> 28:15.061
How are we gonna tell him?

28:15.094 --> 28:18.397
Let's just talk
about the mass.

28:18.430 --> 28:19.398
What about the AIDS?

28:19.431 --> 28:21.000
You want to tell him

28:21.033 --> 28:22.001
about that?

28:22.034 --> 28:22.969
We should take it...

28:23.002 --> 28:24.303
just one step at a time.

28:24.336 --> 28:26.272
You want to start
lying to him now?

28:26.305 --> 28:28.040
It's not lying.
Miss Boulet,

28:28.074 --> 28:29.475
with all due respect...
I know what
I'm doing.

28:29.508 --> 28:31.010
Right. Right. You're
the specialist.

28:31.043 --> 28:32.845
You have all
the answers.
Do you think

28:32.879 --> 28:34.346
this is easy for me?
Patients have

28:34.380 --> 28:35.915
the right to know.
He's my kid.

28:35.948 --> 28:37.283
He's mine, too.

28:37.316 --> 28:39.952
You don't think he
reads the pamphlets?

28:39.986 --> 28:42.054
You don't think he
listens to your calls?

28:42.088 --> 28:45.257
Carlos knows what
an AIDS-defining illness is.

28:52.131 --> 28:54.233
Just give her
a minute.

28:54.266 --> 28:55.467
Yeah.

28:55.501 --> 28:56.803
She's stubborn.

28:56.803 --> 28:58.204
It's either her way or no way.

29:05.144 --> 29:06.445
Hey, Sam.

29:06.478 --> 29:08.247
Did Ortho see the
post-reduction film

29:08.280 --> 29:09.415
on the pregnant soldier?

29:09.448 --> 29:10.850
They signed off on it.

29:10.883 --> 29:12.819
Good.

29:12.819 --> 29:15.187
I'm sorry to hear about
what you've been through.

29:15.221 --> 29:17.389
Uh... Yeah. Well.

29:17.423 --> 29:18.991
I appreciate that.

29:19.025 --> 29:21.127
But, FYI, I don't think
it's appropriate

29:21.160 --> 29:24.030
to share that type of personal
stuff with the patients.

29:24.063 --> 29:25.331
Excuse me?

29:25.364 --> 29:26.866
They're dealing with
their own crisis.

29:26.899 --> 29:28.234
They don't need
to listen to ours.

29:41.313 --> 29:42.448
Hey.

29:49.188 --> 29:50.289
Hey, Doc.

29:50.322 --> 29:52.524
I thought you split.

29:54.326 --> 29:56.295
How's Beth?

29:56.328 --> 29:58.497
How do you think?

29:58.530 --> 30:01.033
I don't believe her.

30:01.067 --> 30:02.368
Well, you think
she's telling the truth?

30:02.401 --> 30:03.502
Yeah, I do.

30:03.535 --> 30:05.137
Doesn't matter what I think.

30:07.173 --> 30:10.176
You know, I was always afraid
of her stepping on an IED

30:10.209 --> 30:12.211
or getting killed
by a sniper, but...

30:12.244 --> 30:14.013
Something like this?

30:14.046 --> 30:16.515
You know, we shouldn't have
to worry about our own guys.

30:16.548 --> 30:18.951
We're all supposed to be over
there defending our country.

30:18.985 --> 30:21.520
You're right
about that, but...

30:21.553 --> 30:22.955
start by defending her.

30:28.360 --> 30:29.996
What kind of spot?

30:30.029 --> 30:31.397
Well, we're not sure.

30:31.430 --> 30:33.866
It could be caused
by some germs.

30:33.900 --> 30:35.467
Or it could be something else.

30:35.501 --> 30:37.136
Can you take it out?

30:37.169 --> 30:38.437
It's not that easy.

30:38.470 --> 30:41.540
We have to do some
more tests first.

30:41.573 --> 30:44.076
What kind of tests?

30:44.110 --> 30:47.479
Well, what we want to do is
just take a little piece out

30:47.513 --> 30:49.882
and look at it
under a microscope.

30:49.916 --> 30:51.417
You mean I have a tumor?

30:55.254 --> 30:57.356
Remember I told you,

30:57.389 --> 31:00.392
God helps us through
the good times...

31:00.426 --> 31:01.994
and the bad.

31:02.028 --> 31:05.932
We have to have faith.

31:05.965 --> 31:09.201
He's gonna hold our hands
through this.

31:13.172 --> 31:15.207
All of us together, buddy.

31:18.277 --> 31:19.211
Carlos.

31:20.179 --> 31:21.147
Hey, Carlos.

31:21.180 --> 31:22.081
Carlos.

31:22.114 --> 31:23.449
What's happening?

31:23.482 --> 31:25.251
All right, push two
of lorazepam right now.

31:25.284 --> 31:27.253
The second two didn't touch him.

31:27.286 --> 31:28.387
He's maxed out
on lorazepam.

31:28.420 --> 31:29.088
What next?

31:29.121 --> 31:30.389
Pentobarb.

31:30.422 --> 31:31.423
You wanna go straight
to pentobarb?

31:31.457 --> 31:33.125
Yeah, we have to stop this.

31:33.159 --> 31:35.127
Pulse is up to 165.

31:35.161 --> 31:36.295
Oh, God.
BOULET:
Try Depakote.

31:36.328 --> 31:37.496
No, it takes too long.

31:37.529 --> 31:40.432
Get Pedes neuro down here.
Ugh. Why?

31:40.466 --> 31:42.068
He's got elevated ICP and
he's failed first-line drugs.

31:42.101 --> 31:43.169
It's a no-brainer.

31:43.202 --> 31:44.436
I'd like to get a neuro consult

31:44.470 --> 31:46.138
before you induce
a coma in this kid.

31:46.172 --> 31:47.673
A coma? No. No way.

31:47.706 --> 31:49.508
We should avoid intubation.
He's going to need

31:49.541 --> 31:51.543
general anesthesia
for the biopsy anyway.

31:51.577 --> 31:53.412
HALEH:
Sat's dropping, 87.

31:53.445 --> 31:56.382
All right, call Respiratory,
prep a 6-0 ET tube.

31:56.415 --> 31:57.416
I think that's excessive, Greg.

31:57.449 --> 31:58.517
He needs an anticonvulsant.

31:58.550 --> 32:00.987
Pentobarbital 300 milligrams IV.

32:03.689 --> 32:06.025
Haleh, now.

32:14.266 --> 32:15.334
All right, I'm in.

32:15.367 --> 32:17.136
Bag him up.
What about an EEG?

32:17.169 --> 32:19.405
Nope, they'll do it in the OR.
Pentobarb drip at 30 migs

32:19.438 --> 32:20.572
per hour and...
Does he need steroids?

32:20.606 --> 32:22.674
I was ordering
six of Decadron.

32:22.708 --> 32:25.211
What's that for?
It's to reduce the swelling
around the lesion.

32:25.244 --> 32:27.413
Are you staying
while he's in surgery?

32:27.446 --> 32:28.480
Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.

32:28.514 --> 32:29.581
Well done, Greg.

32:29.615 --> 32:31.417
They're ready
for him in OR.

32:31.450 --> 32:32.251
TAGGART:
Hey.

32:32.284 --> 32:33.719
What's up?

32:33.752 --> 32:35.554
I guess Beth's boyfriend
never made it back, huh?

32:35.587 --> 32:37.589
I saw him outside.
I tried to talk to him,

32:37.623 --> 32:39.025
but I guess I wasn't
that persuasive.

32:39.025 --> 32:40.292
You not persuasive?

32:40.326 --> 32:42.128
Come on. I thought
you were a sweet-talker.

32:42.161 --> 32:45.031
I guess even this situation
was beyond me.

32:45.031 --> 32:46.665
Guess again.

32:50.136 --> 32:51.170
Hmm, he came back.

32:51.203 --> 32:52.304
Well, I knew he would.

32:52.338 --> 32:53.739
I just wanted to make sure

32:53.772 --> 32:56.742
that you knew that I knew
that, you know...

32:56.775 --> 32:58.344
How you doing?

32:58.377 --> 32:59.578
I'm better now.

32:59.611 --> 33:01.047
How's the ankle?

33:01.080 --> 33:02.748
The splint's
really helping.

33:02.781 --> 33:04.583
TAGGART:
Got to keep it
elevated at home, okay?
Okay.

33:04.616 --> 33:06.718
Speaking of which,
when can we get her out of here?

33:06.752 --> 33:08.387
GATES:
Soon. I just want
to talk to you

33:08.420 --> 33:09.688
about the
pregnancy options.

33:09.721 --> 33:11.657
I can make a call
to the gynecologist

33:11.690 --> 33:14.593
and you could have a D&C done
as early as tomorrow.

33:14.626 --> 33:16.228
I'm not getting an abortion.

33:17.396 --> 33:19.531
You want to have this baby?

33:19.565 --> 33:21.233
Beth, I don't understand.

33:21.267 --> 33:22.634
Let me call a counselor
down here to talk to you.

33:24.370 --> 33:26.538
I'm gonna keep it.

33:26.572 --> 33:29.341
Pregnant soldiers
don't get sent back.

33:30.842 --> 33:33.179
I love Earth and,
and Veer-Zaara.

33:33.212 --> 33:34.813
They're epic.

33:34.846 --> 33:36.748
NEELA:
Since when did you follow
Bollywood movies?

33:36.782 --> 33:38.584
Since he went on the Internet
20 minutes ago.

33:40.386 --> 33:43.222
Truth is I don't really watch
Indian films.

33:43.255 --> 33:45.124
Well, surely, when you go home
to the motherland

33:45.157 --> 33:46.358
you've caught a few.

33:46.392 --> 33:49.228
I've never actually been
to India.

33:49.261 --> 33:52.298
You know, not every Indian
person's been to India, Morris.

33:52.331 --> 33:53.165
It's like assuming
every African-American

33:53.199 --> 33:54.733
has been to Africa.

33:54.766 --> 33:58.104
Yeah, well, I just assumed
arranged marriages-India, hello.

33:58.104 --> 33:59.305
You assumed wrong, butthead!

33:59.338 --> 34:00.206
Bite me!

34:00.239 --> 34:02.208
Rasgotra, you buying?

34:02.241 --> 34:03.275
Dr. Grossman.

34:03.309 --> 34:05.211
Be right back.

34:07.813 --> 34:09.815
Um, I hope you're cool
about earlier.

34:09.848 --> 34:11.783
What, about how
you stole our case?

34:11.817 --> 34:13.652
I was trying
to be proactive.

34:13.685 --> 34:15.821
That's what my girlfriend
said when she moved out.

34:15.853 --> 34:17.822
I'm joking, Rasgotra.

34:17.856 --> 34:19.225
Sorry.

34:19.257 --> 34:20.759
I love proactivity.

34:20.792 --> 34:24.130
In fact, how would you feel
about an ortho rotation?

34:24.163 --> 34:26.598
Really?
Mm-hmm.

34:26.632 --> 34:28.199
Um, well, I'm flattered,

34:28.234 --> 34:30.136
but I have to talk
to Dr. Dubenko first.

34:30.136 --> 34:31.469
Yeah, I already
did that.

34:31.503 --> 34:33.605
You have a surgical elective
requirement,

34:33.639 --> 34:35.274
so now you're all mine.

34:35.306 --> 34:36.742
Really?
Mm-hmm.

34:36.775 --> 34:38.877
And he's gonna just let me out
that easily?

34:38.909 --> 34:41.246
You're gonna be with
the cool kids next week.

34:41.280 --> 34:42.848
Be ready.

34:42.880 --> 34:45.150
I'm pretty tough.

34:45.184 --> 34:46.652
Having the baby's
not the answer.

34:46.685 --> 34:48.587
Right, Beth, there are
other ways to handle this.

34:48.620 --> 34:50.356
I'm not going
back over there.

34:50.389 --> 34:51.422
I don't believe
in it anymore.

34:51.456 --> 34:52.458
All right,
so report him.

34:52.491 --> 34:53.891
I can't prove anything.

34:53.925 --> 34:55.726
What if he's hurting
other people, too?

34:55.761 --> 34:56.728
Think about that.

34:56.762 --> 34:59.631
Yeah, he's right.

34:59.665 --> 35:02.168
I know it's scary,
but you can do it.

35:05.471 --> 35:07.906
I love you

35:07.939 --> 35:09.908
and I support you,

35:09.941 --> 35:12.244
and the last thing

35:12.278 --> 35:14.746
I'm gonna do is let anything
else bad happen to you...

35:14.780 --> 35:17.716
including going back over there.

35:17.749 --> 35:19.185
I promise.

35:28.194 --> 35:29.695
(sobbing)

35:33.799 --> 35:35.201
Okay.

35:49.481 --> 35:52.618
(laughing)

35:52.651 --> 35:54.320
What are you
looking at?

35:54.353 --> 35:57.323
You fools.

35:57.356 --> 36:01.227
Neela's crazy cousin
took these.

36:01.260 --> 36:07.333
We are the most idiotic,
dysfunctional family ever.

36:07.366 --> 36:08.700
(laughing)

36:12.371 --> 36:14.906
Frank, if anybody's looking
for me, I'll be upstairs.

36:14.940 --> 36:16.242
Yeah, okay.

36:27.986 --> 36:29.488
Hey.

36:32.991 --> 36:35.361
They're still
working on him.

36:35.394 --> 36:38.930
I was gonna go
get some coffee.

36:38.964 --> 36:40.332
You okay?

36:43.001 --> 36:45.404
That's our boy.

36:45.437 --> 36:48.274
She can sit there
and watch it. I can't.

36:48.307 --> 36:51.643
I know it's tough seeing
your kid in there like that.

36:51.677 --> 36:56.848
You would think her getting HIV
would have crippled her,

36:56.882 --> 36:58.850
but she turned it
into a mission:

36:58.884 --> 37:02.288
the clinics,
the patients.

37:02.321 --> 37:04.990
If she's not mentoring
someone,

37:05.023 --> 37:07.025
she's following up
with a teenager,

37:07.058 --> 37:08.594
make sure they're taking
their medicine.

37:11.297 --> 37:12.698
She seems pretty committed.

37:12.731 --> 37:15.734
Yeah, she sure is.

37:18.937 --> 37:22.874
If you have any questions
or you need anything,

37:22.908 --> 37:24.310
don't hesitate to page me.

37:34.586 --> 37:38.590
Aren't you supposed to tell me
everything's gonna be all right?

37:38.624 --> 37:40.826
Hang in there,
my friend.

37:50.469 --> 37:51.770
Ice is all you can do.

37:51.803 --> 37:53.439
Are you sure
you can't give me

37:53.472 --> 37:55.841
some more tips
over dinner?
(snickers)

37:55.874 --> 37:57.343
What? I thought
it was pretty good

37:57.376 --> 37:58.844
when we were hanging out
before Christmas.

37:58.877 --> 38:00.912
It was, but, uh...

38:00.946 --> 38:02.648
Don't tell me.
You hooked up
with an elf?

38:02.681 --> 38:04.583
No, I was kind bummed
you didn't call, that's all.

38:04.616 --> 38:05.884
I went home to DC
for the holidays.

38:05.917 --> 38:07.419
Got tied up
with the family.

38:07.453 --> 38:09.855
But look, this weekend,
we could catch a movie,

38:09.888 --> 38:11.022
get some drinks.

38:11.056 --> 38:12.858
Hmm, sounds good.

38:15.894 --> 38:17.363
What happened
to the cop?

38:17.363 --> 38:18.764
I thought he was
your new lover.

38:18.797 --> 38:20.632
We're dating.
We're not married.

38:20.666 --> 38:21.867
So this is
a modern thing,

38:21.900 --> 38:23.535
juggle more
than one guy?

38:23.569 --> 38:25.937
Men do it
all the time.

38:25.971 --> 38:27.373
Want to hear
about my dream?

38:27.406 --> 38:28.807
Not particularly.

38:28.840 --> 38:30.442
Earlier, you were
begging for it.

38:30.476 --> 38:31.109
I don't beg.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.478
In my dream you did.

38:32.511 --> 38:34.546
Ew! Was is it sexual?

38:34.580 --> 38:35.947
Ew! No, it wasn't.

38:35.981 --> 38:37.516
You were begging
to do my laundry.

38:37.549 --> 38:39.485
Bye, Tony.

38:39.518 --> 38:41.119
You washed one load
eight times.

38:41.152 --> 38:42.388
You're insane.

38:42.421 --> 38:43.955
What do you think
that means?

38:43.989 --> 38:46.392
You think you're like
a clean freak or something?

39:00.171 --> 39:03.141
The biopsy's going well.

39:03.174 --> 39:05.777
They localized the lesion
and they're getting tissue.

39:07.413 --> 39:08.146
His vitals are great.

39:08.179 --> 39:09.448
He hasn't had

39:09.481 --> 39:11.417
any more seizure activity.

39:14.052 --> 39:15.854
Jeanie, that's good news.

39:15.887 --> 39:18.524
It's just
the beginning.

39:18.557 --> 39:20.726
He'll fight.

39:20.759 --> 39:22.694
He's a tough kid.

39:25.731 --> 39:28.166
When I tested positive

39:28.199 --> 39:31.703
12 years ago...

39:31.737 --> 39:33.439
people were
so freaked by it.

39:35.073 --> 39:36.542
Some of the doctors
didn't think

39:36.575 --> 39:38.510
I should work here anymore.

39:40.746 --> 39:42.448
The nurses had problems
with it, too.

39:42.481 --> 39:45.183
Even my family.

39:45.216 --> 39:48.720
I would go home
for Christmas and...

39:48.754 --> 39:52.891
I'd hear my aunts talking.

39:52.924 --> 39:55.727
"Well, at least she
doesn't have AIDS, girl.

39:55.761 --> 39:58.029
I have to sit her
in the other room to eat."

40:02.801 --> 40:04.503
I don't want Carlos
to go through that.

40:04.536 --> 40:05.971
He doesn't deserve it.

40:07.573 --> 40:08.940
You'll make sure
that doesn't happen.

40:11.943 --> 40:14.746
You know what scares
me about all this?

40:14.780 --> 40:18.083
What if everything
I've been fighting for

40:18.116 --> 40:19.451
is a bunch of bull?

40:19.485 --> 40:20.886
It's not.

40:20.919 --> 40:23.221
I tell my patients
they won't end up here,

40:23.254 --> 40:24.923
but they do.

40:29.561 --> 40:30.962
My ex, Al, died
two years ago.

40:30.996 --> 40:32.931
He was 78 pounds.

40:34.633 --> 40:37.569
Didn't even recognize me.

40:37.603 --> 40:40.171
My friend Paulette

40:40.205 --> 40:41.807
was the first person I met

40:41.840 --> 40:42.941
in support group.
Miss Boulet...

40:42.974 --> 40:45.243
If I lose him...

40:45.276 --> 40:47.479
I'm done with it.

40:47.513 --> 40:50.248
Don't say that.

40:50.281 --> 40:53.184
It's true.
I won't do it anymore.

40:53.218 --> 40:54.886
You have to.

40:56.287 --> 40:58.590
Do it for Carlos.

40:58.624 --> 41:00.091
Do it for yourself.

41:00.125 --> 41:03.962
But whatever you decide,
you keep doing it.

41:03.995 --> 41:05.564
Because you are
exactly what we need.

41:16.842 --> 41:19.110
You're not so bad, Dr. Pratt.

41:20.846 --> 41:21.980
I know.

41:22.013 --> 41:23.281
(chuckles)

41:23.314 --> 41:25.183
It usually takes
people a while, but...

41:25.216 --> 41:28.587
I eventually win 'em over.

41:37.328 --> 41:39.598
I'm going to say
a prayer for him.

41:42.701 --> 41:45.203
Say one for us both.

41:47.606 --> 41:48.674
All right.

42:08.894 --> 42:10.862
(sighs)

42:10.896 --> 42:12.964
Dr. Daniels.

42:12.998 --> 42:15.867
Yeah, it's Dr. Pratt.

42:15.901 --> 42:19.104
I was thinking about
what you said earlier, and...

42:19.137 --> 42:20.872
yeah.

42:20.906 --> 42:23.842
I'm gonna stick around
for round two.

42:25.644 --> 42:28.647
Good. I'll be right up.
