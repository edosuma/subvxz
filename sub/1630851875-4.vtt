00:01.668 --> 00:02.918
- [Narrator] One of the

00:02.920 --> 00:05.421
great engineering wonders
of the world.

00:05.423 --> 00:06.830
- It has allowed
for the movement

00:06.832 --> 00:09.082
of well over a million
ships back and forth

00:09.084 --> 00:11.176
from the Atlantic to
the Pacific ocean.

00:11.178 --> 00:13.003
- [Narrator] Carrying a
quarter trillion dollars

00:13.005 --> 00:14.337
worth of cargo.

00:14.339 --> 00:16.265
- There was a huge boom
in American economy.

00:18.259 --> 00:19.926
- [Narrator] But a little
over a century ago,

00:19.928 --> 00:22.271
the Panama Canal doesn't exist.

00:22.273 --> 00:25.682
- If you want to get from
New York to San Francisco,

00:25.684 --> 00:29.278
you got 13,000
miles to go by ship.

00:29.280 --> 00:30.529
- [Narrator] The
dream to build it

00:30.531 --> 00:33.273
is an unrelenting
35 year struggle.

00:33.275 --> 00:35.701
- 160 Million cubic
yards of material

00:35.703 --> 00:38.695
would have to be excavated
and then dumped somewhere.

00:38.697 --> 00:41.281
- It's a kind of bonkers idea.

00:41.283 --> 00:43.375
- [Narrator] Battling
natural disasters.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.961
- Whatever's underneath
it is gonna get smashed.

00:45.963 --> 00:47.704
- [Narrator] And each other.

00:47.706 --> 00:50.373
- He gets the workers to
fight amongst themselves.

00:50.375 --> 00:51.717
- You're fired.

00:51.719 --> 00:54.136
- This is an assignment
he's not gonna survive.

00:54.138 --> 00:55.545
- [Narrator] And eradicating

00:55.547 --> 00:58.974
the deadliest creature
on earth, the mosquito.

00:58.976 --> 01:02.552
- The Spanish for yellow
fever is the black vomit.

01:02.554 --> 01:04.638
Because at the same
time, you turn yellow,

01:04.640 --> 01:06.056
you begin vomiting blood.

01:06.058 --> 01:07.724
- [Narrator] It's a
heated competition

01:07.726 --> 01:10.227
between the world's
most powerful nations.

01:10.229 --> 01:13.647
- Sorry the Americans
can't present today.

01:13.649 --> 01:15.565
- For De Lesseps he
is motivated by money.

01:15.567 --> 01:17.984
There's a lot of
money to be made.

01:17.986 --> 01:21.163
- This was the biggest
real estate transaction

01:21.165 --> 01:23.165
in the history of the world.

01:23.167 --> 01:25.667
- [Narrator] In a race to
engineer the impossible.

01:25.669 --> 01:26.919
- Failure is not an option.

01:28.663 --> 01:32.591
- There's no other project
of that scale and magnitude,

01:32.593 --> 01:34.593
it was an endeavor
like none other.

01:36.679 --> 01:40.599
- [Narrator] This is the
story of the Panama Canal.

01:41.684 --> 01:44.353
(Dramatic music)

02:02.613 --> 02:05.541
The world's economy is
growing in the 1870s

02:05.543 --> 02:07.376
and the introduction
of the steamship

02:07.378 --> 02:10.379
sparks an unprecedented
rise in international trade.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.790
Goods can be transported faster,

02:13.792 --> 02:16.209
no longer reliant
on sailing ships

02:16.211 --> 02:18.211
at the mercy of the winds.

02:18.213 --> 02:20.556
- Global trade was booming.

02:20.558 --> 02:25.385
You had goods from Asia,
Africa, Europe, North America,

02:25.387 --> 02:27.729
East Coast, West
Coast, South America,

02:27.731 --> 02:30.724
moving around the
planet by ship.

02:30.726 --> 02:32.317
- [Narrator] But
there's no direct route

02:32.319 --> 02:35.312
to get products from the
Atlantic to the Pacific by sea.

02:35.314 --> 02:38.064
(dramatic music)

02:38.066 --> 02:42.819
From Europe to California is
a staggering 14,000 mile trip

02:42.821 --> 02:44.288
around the Southern
tip of Chile.

02:46.240 --> 02:48.074
- If you were trying
to ship something

02:48.076 --> 02:51.828
from Newfoundland
Canada to San Francisco,

02:51.830 --> 02:55.332
you almost literally go from
one Arctic circle to the other.

02:55.334 --> 02:57.467
It's an extraordinary
distance to go.

03:00.421 --> 03:03.006
- [Narrator] A shortcut between
the Atlantic and Pacific

03:03.008 --> 03:05.017
would be a game changer.

03:05.019 --> 03:08.353
Reducing a three week
journey to just 12 hours

03:08.355 --> 03:11.773
and saving hundreds of
millions in shipping costs.

03:11.775 --> 03:14.026
But who will build it and where?

03:15.686 --> 03:18.188
- There are two countries
that are most interested

03:18.190 --> 03:20.490
in building a
canal in the 1870s.

03:22.276 --> 03:24.203
The US and France.

03:26.197 --> 03:28.949
- [Narrator] The US wants to
build their canal in Nicaragua,

03:28.951 --> 03:31.201
the French, in Panama.

03:31.203 --> 03:32.869
- The French envision themselves

03:32.871 --> 03:34.796
as the world's premier
canal builders.

03:34.798 --> 03:37.707
They've already
completed a giant project

03:37.709 --> 03:40.627
in the Suez in Egypt and so
the French saw an opportunity

03:40.629 --> 03:43.805
to take that engineering
know-how, apply it to Panama,

03:43.807 --> 03:47.717
and gain a kind of regional
influence and power.

03:47.719 --> 03:50.354
(ominous music)

03:56.569 --> 04:00.230
- [Narrator] In 1879, top
engineers from 22 countries meet

04:00.232 --> 04:04.234
to officially decide who wins
the bid to build the canal.

04:04.236 --> 04:06.078
But the French have
a secret weapon.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.707
- Ferdinand Lesseps' claim
to fame is the Suez Canal.

04:11.751 --> 04:15.087
He organized the Suez
canal project,

04:15.089 --> 04:18.164
he oversaw the engineering,
he oversaw the financing,

04:18.166 --> 04:21.584
he was the man who
United Europe and Asia.

04:21.586 --> 04:24.596
He was a national hero.

04:24.598 --> 04:28.517
- The Suez canal was one
of the most successful

04:28.519 --> 04:31.261
engineering projects in history.

04:31.263 --> 04:36.108
By digging a trench from the
Red Sea to The Mediterranean,

04:36.110 --> 04:39.686
ships, coming from India
and Asia sail straight

04:39.688 --> 04:41.113
into the European markets.

04:44.450 --> 04:47.452
- The Americans wanna
go through Nicaragua.

04:48.538 --> 04:50.956
They wanna build a lock canal

04:50.958 --> 04:52.949
but that will be
impossible to build

04:52.951 --> 04:54.251
on such a scale as this.

04:55.619 --> 04:57.379
- So when contemplating a canal,

04:57.381 --> 04:58.880
there are really two choices.

04:58.882 --> 05:00.632
The French were very successful

05:00.634 --> 05:02.459
with what's called
a sea level canal,

05:02.461 --> 05:05.137
just digging a trench
all the way through.

05:05.139 --> 05:07.213
The Americans had
some experience in

05:07.215 --> 05:09.632
building canals too
in the great lakes.

05:09.634 --> 05:12.978
They relied on locks,
which float a ship up

05:12.980 --> 05:14.646
as they pump water
in underneath it

05:14.648 --> 05:17.807
and then let the ship
down on the other side,

05:17.809 --> 05:19.151
they're water elevators.

05:20.978 --> 05:25.782
- We need a sea level
canal as great as the Suez.

05:27.568 --> 05:29.235
- Ferdinand Lesseps
is motivated by money

05:29.237 --> 05:31.747
and there's a lot
of money to be made.

05:31.749 --> 05:34.491
If you can get investors to
invest in a Panama project,

05:34.493 --> 05:37.744
that he will then be
responsible for constructing,

05:37.746 --> 05:39.963
he stands to make
billions of dollars.

05:41.499 --> 05:43.416
- [Narrator] After a
week spent evaluating

05:43.418 --> 05:47.337
the feasibility, cost and
time to build each proposal,

05:47.339 --> 05:49.097
the Congress reaches a decision.

05:50.257 --> 05:52.759
The project goes to France.

05:52.761 --> 05:55.512
(audience applauding)

05:55.514 --> 05:57.931
- Lesseps is an
incredible salesman.

05:57.933 --> 05:59.682
This man has the gift of gab.

05:59.684 --> 06:01.267
But there are a number
of engineers who go,

06:01.269 --> 06:03.445
that is a terrible idea,
that will not work.

06:03.447 --> 06:06.448
But De Lesseps is
such a good salesman,

06:06.450 --> 06:08.033
people buy into his idea anyway.

06:10.370 --> 06:13.288
- [Narrator] While most
estimates were over 200 million,

06:13.290 --> 06:16.291
De Lesseps claims the canal
will take just 12 years

06:16.293 --> 06:18.284
and cost half that.

06:18.286 --> 06:20.003
$2 billion today.

06:21.789 --> 06:25.041
Now, he needs to
somehow find the money.

06:25.043 --> 06:28.970
- He tries to raise money from
big institutional investors

06:28.972 --> 06:32.298
and most of them say,
no, this is crazy.

06:32.300 --> 06:36.645
So what he does is he starts
to use his fame from Suez

06:36.647 --> 06:41.224
to persuade over a hundred
thousand small investors

06:41.226 --> 06:48.156
to give him $57 million
dollars in tiny little bonds

06:48.158 --> 06:51.568
that will pay off when the
Panama Canal starts operating.

06:51.570 --> 06:53.161
- [Narrator] The
bonds are expensive,

06:53.163 --> 06:55.488
costing roughly
the annual salary

06:55.490 --> 06:57.574
of the average French citizen.

06:57.576 --> 07:00.243
But within a year, he's
raised enough money

07:00.245 --> 07:01.378
to begin construction

07:03.747 --> 07:06.508
(dramatic music)

07:08.010 --> 07:10.929
(suspenseful music)

07:14.851 --> 07:18.353
After arriving the French
team quickly realizes

07:18.355 --> 07:20.939
they underestimated
the challenge.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.433
- The French run into
every problem imaginable

07:23.435 --> 07:25.935
in trying to build
a sea level canal.

07:25.937 --> 07:28.238
Partially because it's
a kind of bonkers idea.

07:30.032 --> 07:31.533
- [Narrator] Unlike the Suez,

07:31.535 --> 07:33.743
Panama isn't flat sandy terrain.

07:35.455 --> 07:38.615
- The issue with creating
a sea level canal in Panama

07:38.617 --> 07:42.377
is that Pacific and Atlantic
oceans are at different levels.

07:42.379 --> 07:44.546
- [Noel] On the
Pacific side of it

07:44.548 --> 07:48.550
is this ridge of mountains
about nine miles across.

07:48.552 --> 07:49.968
- [Narrator] The mountain pass

07:49.970 --> 07:53.129
becomes known as The
Culebra, Spanish for snake.

07:54.390 --> 07:58.143
And they will attempt to cut
it 210 feet down to sea level.

08:00.054 --> 08:03.315
- All of that material, 160
million cubic yards of material

08:03.317 --> 08:06.735
would have to be excavated
and then dumped somewhere.

08:06.737 --> 08:09.229
No one in human history
had ever attempted

08:09.231 --> 08:11.114
to move that much material.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.825
- [Narrator] But
after two years,

08:13.827 --> 08:16.912
they only managed
to cut three feet.

08:16.914 --> 08:18.830
- It turns out to
be a lot harder

08:18.832 --> 08:21.824
to dig this trench
than expected.

08:21.826 --> 08:24.160
- [Narrator] And
incredibly dangerous.

08:24.162 --> 08:26.746
- Lots of soil is clay-based,

08:26.748 --> 08:28.757
which means when the
rainy season comes

08:28.759 --> 08:30.833
there are these
enormous mudslides.

08:30.835 --> 08:34.754
They bury all their equipment,
kill hundreds of men

08:34.756 --> 08:39.476
and let months of work be
evaporated in just minutes.

08:41.437 --> 08:46.099
- [Narrator] By 1883, only
660,000 cubic meters of earth

08:46.101 --> 08:47.692
have been excavated,

08:47.694 --> 08:50.195
barely 10% of what's been
promised by this point.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.990
And that's not the only
setback they're facing.

08:54.951 --> 08:58.194
(ominous music)

08:58.196 --> 09:00.372
- Yellow fever is
a horrible disease

09:00.374 --> 09:03.700
and it was endemic
in the region.

09:03.702 --> 09:05.285
In English it's called
the yellow fever

09:05.287 --> 09:09.289
mainly because after several
days of intense sickness,

09:09.291 --> 09:12.968
your liver fails and you become
jaundiced and turn yellow.

09:12.970 --> 09:15.053
(man coughs)

09:15.055 --> 09:18.715
The Spanish for yellow
fever is the black vomit.

09:18.717 --> 09:20.967
Because at the same
time, you turn yellow,

09:20.969 --> 09:22.644
you began vomiting blood.

09:22.646 --> 09:25.146
- [Narrator] And they have
no idea what's causing it.

09:26.473 --> 09:30.893
By 1884, 400 workers
die of the disease

09:30.895 --> 09:32.821
and several hundred
others demand

09:32.823 --> 09:34.239
they're returned to France.

09:42.915 --> 09:46.167
De Lesseps is desperate
to calm worried investors

09:46.169 --> 09:47.711
and keep the project going.

09:50.497 --> 09:52.832
- De Lesseps pays off reporters.

09:52.834 --> 09:56.011
He spends about 12
to 13 million francs

09:56.013 --> 09:58.171
which is about 1% of
the overall budget,

09:58.173 --> 10:00.056
basically buying good
press for the canal.

10:02.685 --> 10:05.428
- [Narrator] It's
money he can't afford

10:05.430 --> 10:09.441
and even worse, the
bribes don't work.

10:09.443 --> 10:12.852
- The news of his failures
is beginning to leak out.

10:12.854 --> 10:14.771
It's becoming known that
he's behind schedule

10:14.773 --> 10:18.107
and over budget and that
with every step forward,

10:18.109 --> 10:19.242
he takes two steps back.

10:21.528 --> 10:26.115
- [Narrator] By 1887, the
French have removed just 10 feet

10:26.117 --> 10:27.917
from the Culebra Cut.

10:29.453 --> 10:33.456
A year later, just
20 and De Lesseps

10:33.458 --> 10:35.550
is finally forced
to pull the plug

10:38.879 --> 10:42.215
In less than a decade
20,000 men have died

10:43.059 --> 10:46.636
and De Lesseps has burned
through $287 million dollars

10:46.638 --> 10:49.064
equal to over 8 billion today.

10:50.232 --> 10:51.808
- The Panama canal bankruptcy

10:51.810 --> 10:54.060
is one of the largest in
history up until this point.

10:54.062 --> 10:57.906
It may have been one
of the largest ever.

10:57.908 --> 11:01.734
It is massive enough that
the phrase, kelp Panama,

11:01.736 --> 11:05.830
what a Panama becomes
a synonym in French

11:05.832 --> 11:10.502
for what a mess or what a
failure for decades to come.

11:12.171 --> 11:14.580
- In this these eight
years they've managed only

11:14.582 --> 11:16.666
to dig a quarter of the way.

11:16.668 --> 11:20.336
800,000 investors are
bilked of their money.

11:20.338 --> 11:23.264
It's a failure of global scale

11:23.266 --> 11:25.183
and a disaster personally
for De Lesseps.

11:28.270 --> 11:30.847
- [Narrator] Despite
France's spectacular failure,

11:30.849 --> 11:32.273
people around the world wonder,

11:33.859 --> 11:36.361
will anyone be bold
enough to take on building

11:36.363 --> 11:37.487
the Panama Canal?

11:39.022 --> 11:41.774
One man is, and
he's about to become

11:41.776 --> 11:43.827
the president of the
United States of America.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.793
At the Dawn of the 20th century,

11:51.795 --> 11:56.122
innovations in electricity,
mining and steel production,

11:56.124 --> 11:58.875
make the US the world's
largest exporter

11:58.877 --> 12:00.051
of manufactured goods.

12:01.211 --> 12:03.379
- In 1850 total American exports

12:03.381 --> 12:05.631
amount to about $147
million dolars.

12:05.633 --> 12:09.811
By 1900, that's more
like 1.45 billion.

12:09.813 --> 12:12.221
So it's a tenfold increase.

12:12.223 --> 12:13.815
- If you want one
word to think about

12:13.817 --> 12:15.150
the United States
in this period,

12:15.152 --> 12:16.985
think about overproduction.

12:16.987 --> 12:18.153
Our factories are really good.

12:18.155 --> 12:19.571
We have a lot of resources.

12:19.573 --> 12:21.656
We don't have as many
buyers of our products.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.575
We need more places to sell.

12:24.910 --> 12:25.818
- [Narrator] When
Theodore Roosevelt

12:25.820 --> 12:28.163
becomes president in 1901,

12:28.165 --> 12:29.998
he's determined
to build a canal,

12:31.408 --> 12:33.251
but not only to
boost foreign trade.

12:34.995 --> 12:38.831
- His philosophy is to speak
softly and carry a big stick.

12:38.833 --> 12:42.919
And a part of that means being
able to defend the nation.

12:42.921 --> 12:47.849
So for him, having a vibrant,
strong Navy is crucial

12:48.267 --> 12:50.760
and an important part
of that strong Navy

12:50.762 --> 12:53.772
is the ability to be able to
get to the East or West Coast.

12:55.516 --> 12:58.610
- [Narrator] By 1902, Roosevelt
has the support of Congress

12:58.612 --> 13:01.446
to start construction but
quickly hits a roadblock.

13:03.282 --> 13:06.108
Panama is still a
Colombian province

13:06.110 --> 13:08.620
and Colombia refuses
to sign a treaty.

13:10.364 --> 13:13.199
- Teddy Roosevelt is not the
most patient man on earth.

13:13.201 --> 13:15.710
If you wanted to design
a negotiating strategy

13:15.712 --> 13:18.287
to antagonize Teddy Roosevelt,

13:18.289 --> 13:22.300
you could not have done better
than the Colombian strategy.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.710
- [Narrator] Roosevelt
makes an audacious move.

13:24.712 --> 13:27.296
He collaborates with
Panamanian separatists

13:27.298 --> 13:28.473
to start an uprising.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.811
- This is probably
one of the most

13:34.471 --> 13:37.232
sleazy national origin
stories that one could find.

13:38.901 --> 13:43.404
Literally a separatist revolt
is planned in a hotel room

13:43.406 --> 13:46.407
because Teddy Roosevelt
is finally sick and tired

13:46.409 --> 13:49.077
of the Colombians dragging
out the negotiations.

13:50.404 --> 13:52.572
- He stations the
gunboat USS Nashville

13:52.574 --> 13:55.166
off the coast of Panama
as a show of force.

13:56.669 --> 14:00.338
And without a shot fired
Roosevelt gets his way.

14:02.165 --> 14:04.342
On November 3rd, 1903,

14:04.344 --> 14:07.428
the Panamanian succeed in
forming their own nation.

14:09.014 --> 14:11.924
And a year later Roosevelt
spends 50 million

14:11.926 --> 14:13.434
to take over the project.

14:15.095 --> 14:18.106
- Panama would get $10
million in exchange

14:18.108 --> 14:22.101
for ceding control of the
entire 50 mile canal zone

14:22.103 --> 14:25.029
but also the French company
that was there previously

14:25.031 --> 14:27.940
would get 40 million US
dollars for all the assets

14:27.942 --> 14:30.952
and the remainder of
whatever they left behind.

14:32.362 --> 14:34.205
When the Americans
got there, however,

14:34.207 --> 14:36.624
they realized that perhaps
they've been swindled.

14:36.626 --> 14:38.367
And the equipment the
French left behind

14:38.369 --> 14:40.786
had all been left
to the elements.

14:40.788 --> 14:44.048
What wasn't buried in
mud had rusted out.

14:45.792 --> 14:47.802
- [Narrator] Even Roosevelt's
hand-picked Chief Engineer,

14:47.804 --> 14:50.138
John Wallace, isn't optimistic

14:50.140 --> 14:51.723
about his chances for success.

14:53.392 --> 14:55.051
- It's said that he brings
two coffins with him,

14:55.053 --> 14:57.470
one for himself, and
one for his wife,

14:57.472 --> 15:00.473
because he assumed
based on what he's heard

15:00.475 --> 15:04.068
about how dangerous and what
the conditions are in Panama,

15:04.070 --> 15:06.738
that this is an assignment
he's not gonna survive.

15:08.815 --> 15:10.316
- [Narrator] When
construction begins

15:10.318 --> 15:11.993
familiar problems arise.

15:12.995 --> 15:14.662
- Progress was slow.

15:14.664 --> 15:16.989
They've met all the same
obstacles the French did.

15:16.991 --> 15:20.409
There was nothing different,
nothing new in their approach

15:20.411 --> 15:21.920
to cutting through Panama.

15:23.330 --> 15:25.998
- [Narrator] After
two difficult years,

15:26.000 --> 15:28.092
the chief engineer quits.

15:28.094 --> 15:30.086
- He did not cite
anything publicly,

15:30.088 --> 15:31.679
other than he had family issues,

15:31.681 --> 15:33.848
but privately he was exhausted.

15:35.592 --> 15:38.427
- 128 Million into the project

15:38.429 --> 15:41.097
and Roosevelt's bold
gamble in Panama

15:41.099 --> 15:43.441
is already on the
verge of failure.

15:48.105 --> 15:50.365
- Roosevelt faces
a lot of criticism

15:50.367 --> 15:53.275
and people are already
referring to it as Teddy's folly

15:53.277 --> 15:54.702
or Roosevelt's folly.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.873
- But this is where
Roosevelt's stupendous ego

15:58.875 --> 16:00.616
comes into play.

16:00.618 --> 16:02.126
In his mind failure
is not an option.

16:03.787 --> 16:05.871
- [Narrator] Roosevelt
knows strong leadership

16:05.873 --> 16:08.958
could be the key and
looks for a chief engineer

16:08.960 --> 16:10.385
who is as tough as he is.

16:11.387 --> 16:14.138
(dramatic music)

16:18.310 --> 16:21.729
- John Frank Stevens was
an engineer's engineer.

16:21.731 --> 16:23.314
-Come on, let's pick
up the pace!

16:23.316 --> 16:25.891
He had built some of the
most challenging railroads

16:25.893 --> 16:26.818
in north America.

16:28.404 --> 16:31.823
This guy lived to build
ambitious infrastructure.

16:33.400 --> 16:34.909
- He's not just
accomplished as an engineer

16:34.911 --> 16:36.318
in terms of design,

16:36.320 --> 16:38.579
he's accomplished in
terms of what we today

16:38.581 --> 16:40.489
would call project management.

16:40.491 --> 16:44.577
He actually thinks wholistically
about what is needed

16:44.579 --> 16:46.829
and what needs to be
done and that appealed

16:46.831 --> 16:48.172
to Theodore Roosevelt.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.177
- Tell the President I'll
let him know tomorrow.

16:54.921 --> 16:58.007
- Stevens is being
asked to go to Panama

16:58.009 --> 17:00.092
to manage a
construction disaster.

17:00.094 --> 17:02.186
You gotta go down to
a tropical country

17:02.188 --> 17:05.347
that's disease-ridden,
far from your family,

17:05.349 --> 17:07.016
and you're not
actually getting paid

17:07.018 --> 17:09.694
huge sums of money to do this.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.195
- It took his wife
to convince him

17:11.197 --> 17:13.364
that every engineering
project he never completed

17:13.366 --> 17:17.193
had led him to this one
moment, the big project.

17:17.195 --> 17:18.694
Larger and more consequential

17:18.696 --> 17:21.289
than anything he
had taken on before.

17:21.291 --> 17:22.874
(soft music)

17:22.876 --> 17:25.877
- Stevens knows if he
succeeds he'll do what neither

17:25.879 --> 17:30.206
the French nor America's
best engineer could do.

17:30.208 --> 17:32.717
- You almost really have to
appeal to somebody patriotism

17:32.719 --> 17:35.136
and sense of mission to
get them to accept this.

17:35.138 --> 17:37.638
This nightmare job.

17:39.049 --> 17:41.893
(dramatic music)

17:43.645 --> 17:46.222
- [Narrator] On July 26th, 1905,

17:46.224 --> 17:49.734
John Stevens arrives in Panama
to take over the challenge.

17:51.653 --> 17:54.072
(dramatic music)

17:54.074 --> 17:55.397
- Steven's comes in and
looks at this thing and says,

17:55.399 --> 17:59.235
this is a excrement show.

17:59.237 --> 18:01.996
It's a rolling disaster.

18:01.998 --> 18:03.748
On the other hand, I think
he's a little relieved

18:03.750 --> 18:05.500
because the problems are
so big that he thinks,

18:05.502 --> 18:06.667
okay, I know how to fix this.

18:06.669 --> 18:08.744
This is like such a disaster

18:08.746 --> 18:12.173
that it is not rocket
science to sort out the mess

18:12.175 --> 18:13.591
that's - happening over here.

18:15.168 --> 18:16.177
- Tell everyone to stop.

18:18.013 --> 18:21.006
- But the first thing he did
is stop the digging completely.

18:21.008 --> 18:22.925
He knew from his
days in the railroad,

18:22.927 --> 18:25.186
that a happy and safe workforce

18:25.188 --> 18:27.179
was a much more productive one.

18:27.181 --> 18:29.941
So instead of focusing
on cutting further,

18:29.943 --> 18:34.195
he built towns,
he built bakeries.

18:34.197 --> 18:37.949
He built bars and schools
and churches and roads.

18:37.951 --> 18:41.193
- Stevens decision
to stop the work,

18:41.195 --> 18:44.613
increasing their comfort,
therefore their motivation,

18:44.615 --> 18:47.116
their productivity,
their efficiency

18:47.118 --> 18:49.961
was an absolute must do.

18:51.538 --> 18:53.631
- [Narrator] But Steven still
faces the biggest threat

18:53.633 --> 18:56.968
to the Canal's
progress, disease.

18:58.545 --> 19:01.055
With hundreds of workers
dying every month,

19:01.057 --> 19:02.974
Stevens turns to a specialist.

19:04.551 --> 19:07.636
- Dr. William Gorgas is hired
as the sanitation expert

19:07.638 --> 19:09.063
for the project.

19:09.065 --> 19:11.140
He came from a time in Cuba

19:11.142 --> 19:13.225
in which he fought
yellow fever there

19:13.227 --> 19:16.145
and had an idea about how
to handle it in Panama

19:16.147 --> 19:17.646
but it was controversial.

19:17.648 --> 19:19.240
- Most people
thought that disease

19:19.242 --> 19:22.568
was likely transmitted by ants.

19:22.570 --> 19:25.070
So what's the solution if
you are worried about ants?

19:25.072 --> 19:26.831
You put everything you own

19:26.833 --> 19:29.083
in little standing
pools of water.

19:29.085 --> 19:30.910
The ants can't get
past the water,

19:30.912 --> 19:32.086
it's a brilliant solution.

19:32.088 --> 19:33.754
Little did they
realize of course,

19:33.756 --> 19:36.007
that they were creating the
perfect breeding environment

19:36.009 --> 19:38.426
for the thing that was
actually killing them.

19:38.428 --> 19:42.513
- William Gorgas is the first
major believer in the idea

19:42.515 --> 19:45.341
that major diseases in the
tropics are transmitted

19:45.343 --> 19:47.593
parasitically
through mosquitoes.

19:47.595 --> 19:48.844
- [Narrator] Under Gorgas'

19:48.846 --> 19:52.264
leadership, a huge team,
over 4,000 workers,

19:52.266 --> 19:56.277
forge an all out war against
mosquito breeding grounds.

19:56.279 --> 19:59.614
- And he moves to get rid
of still bodies of water,

19:59.616 --> 20:02.617
where mosquitoes
lay their larva.

20:02.619 --> 20:06.370
He's spraying water with
oil to create a film on top

20:06.372 --> 20:08.956
that will prevent larva
from being able to hatch.

20:08.958 --> 20:12.126
He's also trying to get
screens added to all buildings,

20:12.128 --> 20:15.129
he wants screens over beds.

20:16.298 --> 20:18.540
- Gorgas' plan is expensive.

20:18.542 --> 20:20.376
Screening the living
quarters alone

20:20.378 --> 20:23.879
cost the equivalent
of 2.5 million today,

20:23.881 --> 20:25.640
and few believe it will work.

20:27.550 --> 20:30.811
- People have deep skepticism
about Gorgas' methods.

20:30.813 --> 20:33.314
They think that he is
some kind of experimenter

20:33.316 --> 20:36.067
who's more interested in
getting his name published

20:36.069 --> 20:38.060
in scientific journals
than actually bringing

20:38.062 --> 20:39.904
the canal project to fruition.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.398
- [Narrator] For Stevens,
supporting Gorgas' plan

20:42.400 --> 20:45.484
is an enormous risk,
of time and money.

20:45.486 --> 20:47.403
- Stevens is a brave man.

20:47.405 --> 20:49.571
He's willing to
risk his reputation.

20:49.573 --> 20:51.240
He's willing to risk criticism

20:51.242 --> 20:52.917
to do what he thinks is right.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.327
So whether that means
attacking mosquitoes,

20:55.329 --> 20:58.339
trying to stop the
problem of disease,

20:58.341 --> 21:01.425
he's willing to take these
bold risks when he's convinced

21:01.427 --> 21:02.751
that they're the
right thing to do.

21:02.753 --> 21:04.262
- [Narrator] And if it fails,

21:04.264 --> 21:07.423
so will, America's
dream for a canal.

21:07.425 --> 21:08.933
(dramatic music)

21:13.847 --> 21:15.597
It takes several months,

21:15.599 --> 21:18.776
but Dr. Gorgas' unprecedented
war on the mosquito

21:18.778 --> 21:21.687
has infection rates across
the canal zone plummeting

21:21.689 --> 21:24.440
and amazingly in November, 1905,

21:24.442 --> 21:28.027
Panama has its last case
of yellow fever ever.

21:28.029 --> 21:29.537
- Gorgas manages to
reduce death rates

21:29.539 --> 21:31.956
from yellow fever and
malaria by a factor of 10.

21:31.958 --> 21:34.625
And without it, it's quite
likely that the Americans

21:34.627 --> 21:37.286
would have faced a disaster
on the scale of the French.

21:37.288 --> 21:40.131
(dramatic music)

21:41.383 --> 21:43.217
- [Narrator] 18 Months
into construction

21:43.219 --> 21:46.462
the workforce
grows to 24,000 men

21:46.464 --> 21:48.723
and Chief Engineer,
John Stevens,

21:48.725 --> 21:50.883
can finally resume
trying to cut through

21:50.885 --> 21:53.311
the 200 foot Culebra Mountains.

21:55.722 --> 21:57.148
- In order to build this canal,

21:57.150 --> 22:00.059
they have to remove enough dirt
that will be comparable

22:00.061 --> 22:04.730
to building 117 Empire State
Buildings or 92 Colosseums.

22:05.741 --> 22:08.650
- The big elephant for
Stevens is waste disposal.

22:08.652 --> 22:10.911
You're digging these
giant trenches.

22:10.913 --> 22:12.580
You're cutting down a mountain.

22:12.582 --> 22:14.665
You need to get rid
of all the detritus.

22:16.159 --> 22:17.418
- [Narrator] The French
had relied on a system

22:17.420 --> 22:19.170
of steam shovels to move dirt

22:20.922 --> 22:24.666
but it's a painfully
slow process.

22:24.668 --> 22:27.511
(ominous music)

22:27.513 --> 22:29.588
- What are tracks doing
all the way out here?

22:29.590 --> 22:30.681
- Its the old railroad.

22:32.008 --> 22:34.685
(ominous music)

22:39.933 --> 22:41.442
- Transoceanic railroad.

22:45.271 --> 22:46.864
Ain't that something.

22:50.619 --> 22:52.027
- [Narrator] Steven's
begins rebuilding

22:52.029 --> 22:54.121
the old Panama railroad,

22:54.123 --> 22:56.615
seeing potential that
the French didn't.

22:56.617 --> 23:00.202
And spending 9 million to
get it back up and running.

23:00.204 --> 23:01.286
(dramatic music)

23:01.288 --> 23:02.463
- Rehabilitating the railroad

23:02.465 --> 23:05.383
and using it to move
the dirt was genius.

23:05.385 --> 23:08.386
I mean, it was a very
practical use of something

23:08.388 --> 23:12.381
that was in existence, that
made sense and it worked.

23:12.383 --> 23:15.717
- So he actually creates
special train wagons

23:15.719 --> 23:18.646
that have sides that
collapse into a flatbed

23:18.648 --> 23:21.807
and then he creates a
plow that allows the dirt

23:21.809 --> 23:23.809
to be moved off this cart.

23:23.811 --> 23:27.980
So that allows him to progress
in a much more efficient way

23:27.982 --> 23:29.907
than what the French
have done before.

23:31.576 --> 23:33.819
- [Narrator] Soon workers
are digging in a single day,

23:33.821 --> 23:35.413
what the French dug in a month.

23:37.332 --> 23:40.159
But a year and a half into
his time on the canal,

23:40.161 --> 23:41.743
there's still one thing

23:41.745 --> 23:44.580
Stevens hasn't been
able to conquer.

23:44.582 --> 23:47.258
(dramatic music)

23:56.935 --> 23:59.603
(ground rumbling)

24:01.431 --> 24:03.023
- The jungle itself
is what holds

24:03.025 --> 24:04.358
the soil together in Panama

24:04.360 --> 24:07.194
and so when they
start digging away

24:07.196 --> 24:09.697
and exposing it and it gets wet,

24:09.699 --> 24:11.615
it no longer has
that cohesiveness

24:11.617 --> 24:13.868
and becomes basically
just like a sticky fluid

24:13.870 --> 24:15.953
that's gonna flow downhill.

24:16.779 --> 24:19.874
Whatever's underneath
it is gonna get smashed.

24:19.876 --> 24:21.459
- [Narrator] Steven's
and his workers

24:21.461 --> 24:25.212
face nearly 10 mudslides a
year which erase any progress

24:25.214 --> 24:27.873
cutting the mountains
down to sea level.

24:27.875 --> 24:28.716
- It'll never work.

24:30.886 --> 24:32.470
The sea level canal
will never work.

24:33.963 --> 24:35.556
- You could tell it
was a sisyphean task.

24:35.558 --> 24:37.799
They would dredge
out this channel,

24:37.801 --> 24:40.728
but then more mud and
rocks would slide in

24:40.730 --> 24:42.471
and fill in all the
work they just done.

24:42.473 --> 24:44.148
- We can't go
through the mountain,

24:45.558 --> 24:46.650
we'll have to go over it.

24:48.487 --> 24:50.404
- [Narrator] Stevens is
convinced the only way to

24:50.406 --> 24:53.657
succed is to build a lock
canal instead

24:53.659 --> 24:56.151
to raise and lower
boats over the mountains.

24:57.320 --> 25:00.414
But in order to put his more
expensive plan into action,

25:00.416 --> 25:02.407
he'll have to do
something more difficult

25:02.409 --> 25:04.326
than moving a mountain.

25:04.328 --> 25:06.078
(dramatic music)

25:06.080 --> 25:08.589
Convince the United
States government

25:08.591 --> 25:10.508
to completely change course.

25:15.171 --> 25:18.766
After barely a year, Frank
Stevens is on the verge of being

25:18.768 --> 25:21.435
the second American
engineer to fail

25:21.437 --> 25:23.845
at building a canal
through Panama.

25:23.847 --> 25:27.432
His only hope, somehow
convince members of Congress

25:27.434 --> 25:28.442
to make a change.

25:32.522 --> 25:35.190
- A lock canal will
take eight years,

25:35.192 --> 25:37.701
a sea level, 18 if it
can be done at all.

25:39.454 --> 25:41.446
- Stevens claims that
while his new plan

25:41.448 --> 25:43.874
will cost over 150 million,

25:43.876 --> 25:46.043
it will save a hundred
million in the long run.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.964
- He made it very clear
what the stakes were.

25:49.966 --> 25:51.957
If there was to
be a canal at all,

25:51.959 --> 25:53.792
it had to be a lock design.

25:53.794 --> 25:57.045
The only answer was
to change designs

25:57.047 --> 25:58.806
and move in a
different direction.

25:58.808 --> 26:00.975
- So if there's one thing
people in Washington,

26:00.977 --> 26:02.977
don't like it's
hearing bad news,

26:02.979 --> 26:05.554
especially when the bad
news comes in the form of,

26:05.556 --> 26:07.806
hey, this thing that we
spent a lot of money on,

26:07.808 --> 26:08.566
isn't gonna work.

26:10.226 --> 26:14.238
- A few days later, a skeptical
Senate casts its vote.

26:16.566 --> 26:19.493
- There are moments in
our American history

26:19.495 --> 26:21.912
in which there is only
one right decision

26:21.914 --> 26:25.749
to accomplish the goal
and this was the moment.

26:25.751 --> 26:28.502
Pivotal crossroads in
which America very easily

26:28.504 --> 26:30.671
could have gone
the way of France

26:30.673 --> 26:32.590
and made itself
an embarrassment.

26:34.334 --> 26:38.596
- By a thin margin of 36 to
31, the lock canal passes.

26:40.340 --> 26:43.175
- Stevens new the right way
and he convinced the Senate

26:43.177 --> 26:45.010
that he knew the right way.

26:45.012 --> 26:48.096
- The projected cost of the
new canal is astronomical,

26:48.098 --> 26:52.934
$375 million dollars,
nearly 9 billion today.

26:53.862 --> 26:56.947
And with Congress setting
the deadline for 1914,

26:56.949 --> 27:00.784
just eight years away,
Stevens has no room for error.

27:02.528 --> 27:05.947
- A lock canal required a
lot of more diverse skills.

27:05.949 --> 27:07.699
If you think of a
sea level canal,

27:07.701 --> 27:10.452
it's just excavation
and dirt disposal.

27:10.454 --> 27:13.789
Building locks required
a lot of engineering.

27:13.791 --> 27:16.124
There were no computers
and there's no materials

27:16.126 --> 27:18.710
in Panama so everything
has to be imported.

27:18.712 --> 27:20.054
- [Narrator] For Stevens' plan,

27:20.056 --> 27:22.381
160 feet of The
Culebra Mountains

27:22.383 --> 27:24.466
will still need to be excavated.

27:24.468 --> 27:26.885
40 feet less than the
French were attempting,

27:26.887 --> 27:27.645
and then flooded.

27:29.481 --> 27:32.391
Two sets of locks will be
built on the Pacific side.

27:32.393 --> 27:35.894
One on the Atlantic side which
can raise and lower ships

27:35.896 --> 27:37.905
to 85 feet above sea level.

27:37.907 --> 27:39.898
They'll sail between the locks

27:39.900 --> 27:43.994
using the largest man-made lake
in the world but creating it

27:43.996 --> 27:46.830
will mean building the largest
earthen dam in history.

27:48.157 --> 27:51.752
(dramatic music)

27:51.754 --> 27:55.506
- Stevens and his team
came up with a plan to dam

27:55.508 --> 28:00.085
the Chagres River, turn a
major part of the interior

28:00.087 --> 28:03.171
of Panama into a giant lake.

28:03.173 --> 28:05.516
This was brilliant
for several reasons.

28:05.518 --> 28:08.510
For one, it helped them
control the mudslides

28:08.512 --> 28:10.270
that had been wiping
away equipment

28:10.272 --> 28:12.514
and causing all
kinds of problems.

28:12.516 --> 28:14.525
Two, they didn't even
have to dig the canal

28:14.527 --> 28:17.945
through Central Panama because
for more than 20 miles,

28:17.947 --> 28:20.447
the boats could just sail
across this giant lake.

28:21.950 --> 28:23.859
- [Narrator] Within
months, dirt trains

28:23.861 --> 28:25.869
are carrying soil
and rock to build

28:25.871 --> 28:30.615
the gigantic earthen wall
but progress is still slow

28:30.617 --> 28:32.793
and there is worry
that the lock canal

28:32.795 --> 28:35.045
might also be
impossible to build.

28:36.464 --> 28:38.465
- As the canal
continues to go forward,

28:38.467 --> 28:41.877
Stevens has brought to
bear his gifts and talents.

28:41.879 --> 28:42.970
He's made this more
of a railroad project.

28:42.972 --> 28:44.713
He's put infrastructure
in place,

28:44.715 --> 28:48.216
and now things aren't moving
as rapidly as Congress

28:48.218 --> 28:50.051
and other powers
would like it to.

28:50.053 --> 28:52.888
Undoubtedly he's feeling
stress and pressure.

28:52.890 --> 28:55.649
- You have to imagine
it's at this moment

28:55.651 --> 28:58.059
that he thinks or fears maybe

28:58.061 --> 28:59.987
that he's not the
man for the job.

29:01.740 --> 29:04.158
- [Narrator] For Stevens,
the timing couldn't be worse

29:04.160 --> 29:05.909
for a visit from the president.

29:07.912 --> 29:10.581
- In 1906 Roosevelt decides
that he needs to go down

29:10.583 --> 29:14.334
to personally inspect the
progress of the canal.

29:14.336 --> 29:16.077
And so as with anything
with Roosevelt,

29:16.079 --> 29:19.590
it's gonna be a political
and media spectacle.

29:19.592 --> 29:22.676
- Roosevelt wants to go to
Panama to prove that it's safe.

29:22.678 --> 29:25.095
The timing of his
visit comes at a moment

29:25.097 --> 29:27.672
when the canal project
is under serious threat.

29:27.674 --> 29:31.176
Roosevelt believes that the
only way to reinspire the public

29:31.178 --> 29:34.179
and to inspire Congress that
this project can be completed,

29:34.181 --> 29:36.097
is to go there in person.

29:36.099 --> 29:38.358
- It's the first time
a sitting president

29:38.360 --> 29:40.778
has ever left the United States

29:42.197 --> 29:45.774
and it's a huge morale boost

29:46.201 --> 29:48.952
marked by an iconic
photo opportunity.

29:51.122 --> 29:53.874
- Roosevelt gets into the
construction machinery,

29:53.876 --> 29:55.700
how he keeps that suit
so pristine white,

29:55.702 --> 29:57.377
I have absolutely no idea.

29:59.214 --> 30:01.882
He shows himself to
be Action President.

30:01.884 --> 30:04.635
It's a huge triumphal
visit for him.

30:06.629 --> 30:10.465
- But for the chief engineer,
it's just another obstacle.

30:10.467 --> 30:13.218
- Stevens lacked the
skill of managing

30:13.220 --> 30:16.555
and massaging superiors who
wanted to stick their nose

30:16.557 --> 30:18.148
in what you were doing.

30:18.150 --> 30:21.226
He did not tolerate
unwarranted interference.

30:21.228 --> 30:23.144
He was in charge.

30:23.146 --> 30:24.321
He knew better.

30:24.323 --> 30:25.989
It drove him crazy.

30:26.983 --> 30:29.827
(dramatic music)

30:37.493 --> 30:39.494
- Two months after
Roosevelt's visit

30:39.496 --> 30:41.505
Stevens writes him
a six page letter.

30:43.174 --> 30:44.424
- [Stevens Voiceover] For
the past several years

30:44.426 --> 30:46.585
I've had my methods
questioned by people

30:46.587 --> 30:47.928
I wouldn't wipe my boots on.

30:49.672 --> 30:51.923
I have given up hundreds of
thousands of dollars of income

30:51.925 --> 30:53.183
time with my family.

30:55.344 --> 30:57.929
- Steven's decision has
to be one of heartbreak.

30:57.931 --> 30:59.347
But it's another instance

30:59.349 --> 31:01.516
in which he probably
faced the facts.

31:01.518 --> 31:04.269
He looked at himself
hard and decided

31:04.271 --> 31:07.105
that this is the wrong direction

31:07.107 --> 31:09.524
and he can't work on
the canal anymore.

31:09.526 --> 31:11.451
(dramatic music)

31:11.453 --> 31:14.204
- [Narrator] Less than 20
months into his tenure,

31:14.206 --> 31:18.125
America's second Panama
Canal Chief Engineer resigns,

31:19.961 --> 31:21.295
leaving the world to wonder

31:23.631 --> 31:26.541
whether it can ever
be built at all.

31:26.543 --> 31:27.968
(dramatic music)

31:32.882 --> 31:36.718
By 1907, just one year int

31:36.720 --> 31:38.395
to build a lock canal,

31:38.397 --> 31:41.857
President Teddy Roosevelt
loses another chief engineer.

31:43.809 --> 31:45.393
But for his replacement,

31:45.395 --> 31:47.404
rather than look for
someone who won't quit.

31:48.898 --> 31:51.658
(dramatic music)

31:51.660 --> 31:53.869
Roosevelt, find
someone who can't.

31:55.580 --> 31:58.823
He names George Washington
Goethals chief engineer.

31:58.825 --> 32:01.168
- Goethals was an army engineer

32:01.170 --> 32:02.994
and so he wasn't going anywhere.

32:02.996 --> 32:04.338
He knew the chain of command.

32:04.340 --> 32:06.006
He knew how to follow an order.

32:06.008 --> 32:09.250
He wasn't going to stop
until he was told to stop.

32:09.252 --> 32:12.003
So if ever there was a
person to finish a job,

32:12.005 --> 32:15.015
it would be an army
man like Goethals.

32:15.017 --> 32:16.424
- George Washington Goethals

32:16.426 --> 32:19.010
is an incredibly
meticulous engineer

32:19.012 --> 32:22.681
with a reputation for being
what you could call a hard ass

32:22.683 --> 32:24.265
in getting results.

32:24.267 --> 32:27.602
He is your stereotype
of a military officer

32:27.604 --> 32:30.238
in terms of his desire
and need for order.

32:34.193 --> 32:36.536
- Break time's over,
get back to work.

32:40.616 --> 32:43.251
- [Narrator] But not everyone
welcomes him with open arms.

32:44.286 --> 32:45.370
- Well?

32:45.372 --> 32:47.381
- Workers really liked Stevens.

32:47.383 --> 32:50.717
So not only is Goethals
coming in as the new guy,

32:50.719 --> 32:53.303
who's replacing the
former popular boss,

32:53.305 --> 32:56.890
but he's also military and
for a lot of these workers

32:56.892 --> 32:58.883
that's not a positive thing.

32:58.885 --> 33:02.312
So in this moment, some of
the steam shovel operators,

33:02.314 --> 33:05.148
they see this as their
time to try and push back.

33:05.150 --> 33:08.059
And the vast majority
of them go on strike.

33:08.061 --> 33:12.230
- Then go. All of you.

33:12.232 --> 33:15.316
You're fired, get out of here.

33:15.318 --> 33:17.569
- [Narrator] Rather than
give in to their demands,

33:17.571 --> 33:20.956
Goethals has the European steam
shovel operators deported.

33:22.583 --> 33:24.826
- Goethals starts to bring
in West Indian workers,

33:24.828 --> 33:28.005
primarily from Barbados
to replace the Spanish

33:28.007 --> 33:31.666
who are making too many
demands and going on strikes.

33:31.668 --> 33:33.418
Goethals seems to think
of the workers merely

33:33.420 --> 33:36.513
as pawns on a chess board

33:36.515 --> 33:40.100
- Goethals' no nonsense
style earns him the nickname,

33:40.102 --> 33:43.770
the Czar of Panama and the
workers fall into line.

33:45.606 --> 33:48.099
But to have any hope
of finishing in less

33:48.101 --> 33:49.526
than seven years,

33:49.528 --> 33:51.778
Goethals' men still need
to get the Culebra Cut

33:51.780 --> 33:53.989
down to 40 feet above sea level.

33:56.358 --> 33:58.610
- And the only way to do
that is with dynamite.

33:58.612 --> 34:01.196
And what they're doing is
they're taking this knowledge

34:01.198 --> 34:03.123
from mining, they're
taking this knowledge

34:03.125 --> 34:05.200
from the
transcontinental railroad

34:05.202 --> 34:07.127
where going through
mountain ranges requires

34:07.129 --> 34:09.713
the use of a huge
amount of explosives.

34:09.715 --> 34:12.707
- In engineering terms, Goethals
comes up with techniques

34:12.709 --> 34:15.469
to better use explosives
in the Culebra Cut.

34:15.471 --> 34:18.055
To drill deeply into the rock,

34:18.057 --> 34:21.382
set off dynamite and clear
the resulting rubble.

34:21.384 --> 34:24.469
They eventually use as much
explosives in terms of tonnage

34:24.471 --> 34:25.720
as great Britain produced

34:25.722 --> 34:27.898
during the first
year of World War I

34:27.900 --> 34:30.567
- [Narrator] Ultimately,
more than 60 million pounds

34:30.569 --> 34:33.478
of dynamite will be used
in building the canal.

34:33.480 --> 34:34.654
But there's a downside.

34:36.398 --> 34:39.743
- On December 12th, 1908,
the last dynamite charge

34:39.745 --> 34:43.538
is being set up for excavation
and there's a huge explosion.

34:45.249 --> 34:49.711
23 people are killed instantly
and 40 others are injured.

34:50.663 --> 34:51.913
It's an enormous tragedy.

34:51.915 --> 34:54.716
(dramatic music)

35:00.431 --> 35:05.185
- Goethals' reaction is
extraordinarily cold.

35:05.187 --> 35:10.014
He just comments about the
flesh flying everywhere,

35:10.016 --> 35:14.402
but not a whole lot changes
in the wake of this accident.

35:16.030 --> 35:18.949
- Look, Goethals is a soldier.

35:18.951 --> 35:22.193
And this isn't to say that he
has no concern for human life,

35:22.195 --> 35:26.781
but he sees a unfortunate
by-product of the line of work

35:26.783 --> 35:28.041
that they're in.

35:28.043 --> 35:29.417
He kind of just
keeps chugging along.

35:32.204 --> 35:35.206
- [Narrator] Goethals orders
6,000 men to keep digging

35:35.208 --> 35:36.925
Culebra Cut around the clock.

35:38.302 --> 35:41.462
But for Roosevelt, the
progress is bittersweet.

35:41.464 --> 35:43.965
He leaves office
in March of 1909,

35:43.967 --> 35:46.551
just a few months before
construction begins

35:46.553 --> 35:48.303
on the first set of locks.

35:48.305 --> 35:50.313
The Gatun Locks on
the Atlantic side.

35:51.473 --> 35:54.234
(dramatic music)

35:58.072 --> 35:59.898
The locks for the Panama canal,

35:59.900 --> 36:02.242
will be the biggest
built in history,

36:02.244 --> 36:05.996
1000 feet long,
and 110 feet wide,

36:05.998 --> 36:09.457
large enough to hold an object
the size of the Eiffel Tower.

36:10.993 --> 36:12.502
- This was one of
the first projects

36:12.504 --> 36:15.255
that used millions of
cubic meters of concrete,

36:15.257 --> 36:17.165
which previously had
really been limited

36:17.167 --> 36:19.834
to home construction,
maybe some foundations

36:19.836 --> 36:22.012
or basements and
things like that.

36:22.014 --> 36:24.422
- [Narrator] More than 2
million cubic tons of concrete

36:24.424 --> 36:25.348
needs to be poured.

36:26.842 --> 36:29.677
Enough to build six
Empire State Buildings

36:29.679 --> 36:32.847
and Goethals is struggling
with how to do it.

36:32.849 --> 36:34.941
- The challenges of
building the lock walls

36:34.943 --> 36:37.277
out of concrete are pretty large

36:37.279 --> 36:39.771
because the wall is
quite large itself.

36:39.773 --> 36:42.449
So traditional stone
working techniques

36:42.451 --> 36:45.493
of placing block by block,
it would be a nightmare.

36:47.529 --> 36:49.039
- [Narrator] Rather than
make concrete blocks

36:49.041 --> 36:52.700
and stack them, Goethals
creates a series of cables,

36:52.702 --> 36:57.380
stretching some 800 feet to
suspend the buckets of concrete.

36:58.874 --> 37:01.968
Each bucket weighing
nearly six tons is swung

37:01.970 --> 37:04.137
through the air high
above the locks,

37:04.139 --> 37:05.847
dropped into
position and dumped.

37:07.549 --> 37:09.300
- It's an easier
concrete delivery

37:09.302 --> 37:11.052
method in order to create

37:11.054 --> 37:14.564
such massive walls and also
your equipment and everything

37:14.566 --> 37:17.984
is localized to where
you're conducting the pour

37:17.986 --> 37:19.644
and it's it's right
there on site.

37:19.646 --> 37:21.363
So you can pour faster.

37:22.990 --> 37:24.491
- [Narrator] Over
the next three years,

37:24.493 --> 37:27.652
Goethals completes the
Gatun locks on the Atlantic

37:27.654 --> 37:30.247
and Pedro Miguel
Locks on the Pacific.

37:30.249 --> 37:34.492
But by 1912, concrete
isn't done being poured

37:34.494 --> 37:36.411
on the final set of locks

37:36.413 --> 37:39.747
and the Culebra Cut is
still being excavated.

37:39.749 --> 37:41.174
(ominous music)

37:41.176 --> 37:42.166
- Now, this right
here will be finished

37:42.168 --> 37:44.010
in six years, not two.

37:45.763 --> 37:48.598
- For a soldier who wants
to take orders and execute,

37:48.600 --> 37:52.185
accomplish them, this puts
a lot of pressure on him.

37:52.187 --> 37:54.679
- [Narrator] To have any
hope of finishing on time.

37:54.681 --> 37:56.273
Goethals needs a miracle.

38:04.198 --> 38:06.866
(dramatic music)

38:08.369 --> 38:10.787
It's two years until
the Panama Canal

38:10.789 --> 38:13.948
is supposed to be finished
and Chief Engineer Goethals

38:13.950 --> 38:15.458
is struggling to
stay on schedule.

38:18.462 --> 38:21.965
He has an idea to separate
his workers into two groups

38:21.967 --> 38:24.801
and use a psychological
strategy to motivate them.

38:27.463 --> 38:30.715
- Gentlemen, on the
other side of that lake

38:30.717 --> 38:35.636
are a bunch of soldiers who
are too soft for real battles.

38:35.638 --> 38:38.231
- He tells the civilians
that there's no way

38:38.233 --> 38:39.899
they could beat
the military guys

38:39.901 --> 38:41.476
and he tells military workers

38:41.478 --> 38:44.237
that they're lagging
behind the civilians.

38:44.239 --> 38:46.814
- On the other side of that lake

38:46.816 --> 38:50.160
are a bunch of soft
railroad workers

38:50.162 --> 38:53.663
who think they can pour
concrete faster than you can.

38:53.665 --> 38:56.741
- Soon enough, there's a
full fledged competition

38:56.743 --> 39:00.170
between the two groups, each
one vying to outdo the other.

39:00.172 --> 39:01.004
- Prove them wrong.

39:02.664 --> 39:05.258
- [Narrator] Now, the
re-energized workforce turns

39:05.260 --> 39:07.585
their attention to the
massive iron gates

39:07.587 --> 39:10.338
that will seal the
water in the locks.

39:10.340 --> 39:14.675
- The huge lock gates in the
canal are an engineering Marvel

39:14.677 --> 39:18.021
in and unto themselves
because they're so big,

39:18.023 --> 39:19.272
but they're hollow.

39:19.274 --> 39:21.265
And it's a structure
that is massive,

39:21.267 --> 39:23.109
but also light and nimble.

39:23.111 --> 39:26.112
To move these huge gate locks

39:26.114 --> 39:29.190
it only takes about
25 horsepower,

39:29.192 --> 39:32.202
which is basically like
a riding lawn mower.

39:32.204 --> 39:35.530
- [Narrator] By May, 1913,
a year ahead of schedule,

39:35.532 --> 39:38.291
all three sets of locks
are finally completed.

39:39.701 --> 39:41.628
- The whole construction
of the Panama Canal

39:41.630 --> 39:43.880
was like mission impossible

39:43.882 --> 39:47.959
when you think about where it
was built, when it was built.

39:47.961 --> 39:52.046
The engineers that designed
this locks went to school

39:52.048 --> 39:54.048
in the 1800s.

39:54.050 --> 39:57.560
So it's a pretty amazing
technological endeavor.

39:59.388 --> 40:02.557
- [Narrator] On the afternoon
of October 10th, 1913,

40:02.559 --> 40:05.819
the newly elected president
Woodrow Wilson presses a button

40:05.821 --> 40:08.154
in Washington that
blows the center dyke.

40:14.078 --> 40:17.238
Waters from the Gatun Lake
immediately begin filling

40:17.240 --> 40:20.250
the Culebra Cut
creating a single path

40:20.252 --> 40:25.246
of water 51 miles long and
as much as 1000 feet wide.

40:25.248 --> 40:28.166
It's the culmination of
centuries of dreaming

40:28.168 --> 40:29.426
and a decade of hard work

40:31.920 --> 40:34.764
(dramatic music)

40:36.508 --> 40:38.935
On August 15th, 1914,

40:42.598 --> 40:45.683
The SS Ancon becomes
the first ship to travel

40:45.685 --> 40:47.694
through the Panama canal.

40:47.696 --> 40:50.029
- Nothing is ever
the same again.

40:50.031 --> 40:52.699
The world is
utterly transformed.

40:52.701 --> 40:56.202
We go from having an
Atlantic and a Pacific ocean

40:56.204 --> 40:58.621
functionally to having
one global ocean.

40:59.957 --> 41:01.282
(soft music)

41:01.284 --> 41:02.459
- [Narrator] But
it's at a huge cost

41:03.702 --> 41:06.037
with over 30,000 lives lost,

41:06.039 --> 41:09.290
it's the third deadliest
construction project in history

41:09.292 --> 41:12.793
after the Suez Canal
and Burma-Siam Railway

41:12.795 --> 41:14.962
and one of the priciest.

41:14.964 --> 41:17.140
- During its 10 years
of construction,

41:17.142 --> 41:21.811
the us spends $352 million
dollars on the Panama Canal.

41:23.314 --> 41:27.642
This is four times the
cost of the Suez Canal

41:27.644 --> 41:32.489
and yet it's 23
million under budget.

41:34.575 --> 41:37.235
- Five years after
the canal opens,

41:37.237 --> 41:39.412
Theodore Roosevelt passes away

41:39.414 --> 41:41.998
having never seen it
completed in person.

41:43.325 --> 41:45.409
While John Stevens
is seldom remembered

41:45.411 --> 41:47.245
for his contributions,

41:47.247 --> 41:50.915
George Washington Goethals
is celebrated as the engineer

41:50.917 --> 41:53.000
who did the impossible.

41:53.002 --> 41:56.420
- Both Goethals and Stevens
broke very strong track records

41:56.422 --> 41:58.264
in their own separate spheres

41:58.266 --> 41:59.849
and both of them
accomplished a lot

41:59.851 --> 42:02.101
and Goethals stands on
the shoulders of Stevens.

42:02.103 --> 42:04.262
So I can see Steven's saying,

42:04.264 --> 42:08.525
sure, you might be finishing
this off but you're welcome,

42:08.527 --> 42:09.526
I laid the track.

42:11.186 --> 42:13.104
- The Panama Canal produced
big economic benefits

42:13.106 --> 42:14.781
from the United States.

42:14.783 --> 42:17.534
Those benefits came from moving
cheap oil from California,

42:17.536 --> 42:20.370
and cheap timber from
the Pacific Northwest

42:20.372 --> 42:22.530
and moving them to
markets in the East Coast.

42:22.532 --> 42:25.199
And that was a huge boon
for the American economy.

42:25.201 --> 42:27.794
(ominous music)

42:30.130 --> 42:31.714
- [Narrator] In the last decade,

42:31.716 --> 42:34.375
giant new locks have been
constructed alongside

42:34.377 --> 42:37.295
the originals to
accommodate a new generation

42:37.297 --> 42:39.556
of super container ships.

42:41.308 --> 42:44.143
- The Panama Canal
is one of those ideas

42:44.145 --> 42:46.396
that is literally
world changing.

42:47.731 --> 42:49.649
And even though there
was plenty of failure,

42:49.651 --> 42:51.401
even though it was
very expensive,

42:53.145 --> 42:55.572
there was something inevitable
about it, it had to happen.

42:56.991 --> 42:58.733
And it almost had to
happen at this time

42:58.735 --> 43:01.828
and it almost had to
happen for this nation.

43:03.405 --> 43:05.248
It changed the world.

43:05.250 --> 43:11.412
(triumphant music)
