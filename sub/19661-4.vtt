00:01.320 --> 00:03.320
As usual your honor. Mr. Swindel

00:03.320 --> 00:06.030
Is misrepresenting
the chain of events.

00:06.220 --> 00:08.250
When the officers entered
the premises...

00:08.250 --> 00:11.020
- they kicked in my client's
door without a warrant.

00:11.020 --> 00:12.220
- Is that true?

00:12.230 --> 00:13.990
- The officers heard
a toilet flushing.

00:13.990 --> 00:15.490
- Luis has a weak bladder.

00:15.500 --> 00:17.260
- The police didn't need
a warrant, your honor.

00:17.260 --> 00:19.830
There were clearly
exigent circumstances.

00:19.830 --> 00:21.230
- Yeah, that's right, for Luis.

00:21.230 --> 00:23.000
He downed a six-pack, judge.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.270
Under the fourth amendment,
that search was illegal.

00:25.270 --> 00:26.840
- It was clear to the officers

00:26.840 --> 00:29.210
that the defendant
was destroying his stash.

00:29.210 --> 00:30.340
- They have X-ray vision,
do they?

00:30.340 --> 00:32.210
- Move to exclude, your honor.

00:32.210 --> 00:34.550
- Done. Next.

00:34.550 --> 00:37.550
- Exigent circumstances.
Very nice.

00:37.550 --> 00:39.280
- Not nice enough.

00:39.290 --> 00:43.320
- Hey, you took a shot.
I respect that.

00:43.320 --> 00:46.220
- Ms. Valdez, approach
the bench, if you don't mind.

00:54.270 --> 00:55.400
8:00?

00:57.800 --> 00:59.570
Okay, enough already.

00:59.570 --> 01:01.310
I'll talk to her this week.

01:01.310 --> 01:04.010
- How many times
have I heard that?

01:04.010 --> 01:05.310
- This time I mean it.

01:05.310 --> 01:06.880
Where'd you park?
I'll walk you.

01:06.880 --> 01:09.250
- I'm fine.
I'm just around the corner.

01:09.250 --> 01:11.220
- Night, then.
- Goodnight.

01:14.820 --> 01:16.820
Drive safe.

01:38.310 --> 01:40.040
Ray?

01:42.980 --> 01:44.420
Ray?

01:44.420 --> 01:47.020
Help!
Oh, my god!

01:49.290 --> 01:51.120
- Oh, my...

01:51.120 --> 01:52.890
Help! Somebody help!

01:58.860 --> 02:01.430
- Yes, I need an ambulance.

02:01.430 --> 02:03.900
Uh, 2424 rush street.

02:03.900 --> 02:07.070
Stay with me, ray.

02:07.070 --> 02:08.410
Just keep breathing.

02:08.410 --> 02:10.270
Come on, ray, just stay with me.

02:15.380 --> 02:17.650
- Anna, I know it's hard,

02:17.650 --> 02:19.320
but if you can remember
anything else...

02:19.320 --> 02:21.950
Anything you heard,
anything you saw.

02:21.950 --> 02:23.390
Did you see
anyone else in the street?

02:23.390 --> 02:25.920
- I...

02:25.930 --> 02:28.430
I wasn't really looking.

02:28.430 --> 02:31.400
I got to my car,
I heard the shots,

02:31.400 --> 02:33.400
I saw a motorcycle...

02:34.970 --> 02:37.370
I heard four gunshots.
I definitely...

02:37.370 --> 02:41.310
Heard four gunshots.
- Yeah.

02:41.310 --> 02:43.310
Can I get you something?

02:43.310 --> 02:44.480
You sit tight.

02:44.480 --> 02:46.440
I'll be right back.
Sit tight.

02:48.380 --> 02:50.450
Officer.

02:56.350 --> 02:57.990
- How's she doing?

02:57.990 --> 03:00.090
- It's a tough thing to see.

03:00.090 --> 03:02.490
- Want me to take her home?
- No, I'll do it.

03:02.500 --> 03:04.160
- Pd found the shell casings.

03:04.160 --> 03:06.330
The shooter used a .32
close range.

03:06.330 --> 03:08.430
Feels like a hit.

03:08.430 --> 03:10.400
Kinzie sat on the bench
for 15 years.

03:10.400 --> 03:12.700
Probably put away
over 500 bad guys.

03:12.710 --> 03:15.110
- That's 500 motives.

03:15.110 --> 03:16.440
- I'll see if any of them
got out recently.

03:16.440 --> 03:19.340
Canvass the area.
Maybe somebody saw something.

03:28.220 --> 03:31.020
Hey, I'm gonna take you home.

03:31.020 --> 03:33.120
- How is he?
- Anna...

03:35.060 --> 03:37.090
I'm sorry.

03:43.070 --> 03:44.740
- Come on.
Come on.

03:59.650 --> 04:02.690
- The orange sticker
on the windscreen

04:02.690 --> 04:03.720
of the motorcycle.

04:03.720 --> 04:05.120
- As he drove toward me,

04:05.120 --> 04:07.190
I didn't see
the actual shooting.

04:07.190 --> 04:09.130
- And the guy on the bike...

04:09.130 --> 04:12.000
- Was wearing a full helmet
with a face shield.

04:13.060 --> 04:14.190
There's got to be
surveillance footage

04:14.190 --> 04:15.600
from the credit union
down the street.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.200
I'll call their security team
and we can...

04:17.200 --> 04:19.670
- The shooter had to have
passed it.

04:19.670 --> 04:21.470
- I said no, Anna.

04:21.470 --> 04:23.210
What were you doing
at Sheridan's?

04:28.050 --> 04:30.750
I was there having a drink,
just like everyone else.

04:30.750 --> 04:33.020
- With judge Kinzie?

04:33.020 --> 04:35.720
- I was there alone.
He came in.

04:35.720 --> 04:38.790
I lost the Diaz motion in front
of him that afternoon.

04:38.790 --> 04:43.030
He came over to say
no hard feelings.

04:43.030 --> 04:44.290
- That's it?

04:46.200 --> 04:48.730
Who was he with?
- I didn't notice.

04:48.730 --> 04:52.100
- And yet you left
the bar together.

04:55.070 --> 04:57.210
- I left the bar,
walked to my car,

04:57.210 --> 04:59.310
and heard the gunshots.

05:00.610 --> 05:02.710
Four of them.

05:06.620 --> 05:08.290
- Maybe you should take
a couple of days.

05:08.290 --> 05:11.390
- No, I'm okay.
I should get back to work.

05:13.260 --> 05:16.230
- Do they still teach about
the Chinese wall in law school?

05:17.630 --> 05:20.230
- No way, Peter.
No!

05:20.230 --> 05:22.270
You're not excluding me
from this investigation!

05:22.270 --> 05:27.100
The appearance of impropriety
alone could be a problem later.

05:27.110 --> 05:29.840
If I were you, I would go home
and rest for a couple of days.

05:29.840 --> 05:34.180
- Then there are plenty
of other cases on your desk.

05:42.550 --> 05:44.290
- I spoke with the mayor.

05:44.290 --> 05:48.690
"This rocks the foundation
of civilization," he says.

05:48.690 --> 05:50.760
- Five kids are killed over
the weekend, crickets.

05:50.760 --> 05:53.660
- Those kids weren't
at his daughter's wedding.

05:55.270 --> 05:59.170
Man. Man. Man.

05:59.170 --> 06:01.640
Every year ray and I
went ice fishing.

06:01.640 --> 06:05.180
Shabbona lake,
president's day weekend.

06:05.180 --> 06:09.210
Been doing it since
I was a rookie on the force,

06:09.220 --> 06:11.580
and he was fresh out
of law school.

06:11.580 --> 06:15.150
- I'm sorry, mark.

06:15.150 --> 06:18.120
- He could be her damn father.

06:18.120 --> 06:19.260
- Anna said they just happened

06:19.260 --> 06:20.720
to leave the bar
at the same time.

06:20.730 --> 06:23.730
- And you believe her?
- I do.

06:28.330 --> 06:29.670
Stone.

06:32.200 --> 06:33.670
Good.

06:33.670 --> 06:35.770
Okay.

06:35.770 --> 06:38.280
Cpd arrested a guy trying
to rob a liquor store.

06:38.280 --> 06:41.750
Ballistics says he was using
the same gun that killed Kinzie.

06:41.750 --> 06:43.350
He was on video
at a soup kitchen

06:43.350 --> 06:44.920
at the time of the shooting.

06:49.920 --> 06:52.220
- You know,
every new year's Eve,

06:52.220 --> 06:54.360
Raymond and I would
toast each other.

06:54.360 --> 06:57.160
And he would say, "this is it:".

06:57.160 --> 06:59.160
My last year on the bench."

06:59.170 --> 07:02.200
He could be a counsel
at a downtown firm.

07:02.200 --> 07:03.930
Have a big office,

07:03.940 --> 07:06.940
take clients to lunch or teach.

07:06.940 --> 07:09.410
That's what he really
wanted to do.

07:09.410 --> 07:12.940
We're very sorry, Mrs. Kinzie.

07:14.880 --> 07:18.920
- I apologize.
Um, can I get you something?

07:18.920 --> 07:20.350
People brought so much food.

07:20.350 --> 07:23.250
I think I have
six kinds of cake.

07:23.260 --> 07:25.760
Coffee.
- We're... we're fine,

07:25.760 --> 07:27.390
but if you could just tell us...

07:27.390 --> 07:29.460
- Where I was when ray died.

07:31.800 --> 07:34.460
I'm a suspect, aren't I?
- No, of course not.

07:34.470 --> 07:36.970
We were just wondering if your
husband happened to mention

07:36.970 --> 07:39.340
who he was meeting
at the bar that night.

07:39.340 --> 07:41.510
- No, I thought he was...

07:43.940 --> 07:47.380
After a long week, he liked
to have a quiet drink

07:47.380 --> 07:49.280
before he fought the traffic.

07:49.280 --> 07:50.810
- Did he mention any threats?

07:50.820 --> 07:52.720
Anyone that might
want to hurt him?

07:52.720 --> 07:54.350
- We decided a long time ago

07:54.350 --> 07:56.450
ray would never bring
his work home with him.

07:57.990 --> 08:00.290
- This your daughter?

08:00.290 --> 08:03.260
- Caitlin,
our foster daughter, yes.

08:03.260 --> 08:05.330
We're talking about
adopting her.

08:05.330 --> 08:06.960
- Hm. Can we talk to her?

08:06.970 --> 08:09.830
- She's actually not really
feeling very well.

08:09.840 --> 08:12.800
This whole thing has...
- I'm sure, but you never know.

08:12.810 --> 08:14.910
Caitlin might not even know
that she knows something.

08:14.910 --> 08:17.510
- She, um, took my car
and went shopping.

08:17.510 --> 08:20.510
- The Mercedes?
- Yes.

08:21.950 --> 08:24.510
- I saw a Mercedes parked
in your garage when we came in.

08:24.520 --> 08:27.320
She must've come home.
You didn't notice?

08:27.320 --> 08:29.520
- We're worried that someone
might try to hurt

08:29.520 --> 08:31.960
Caitlin or you, Mrs. Kinzie.
If the killer comes back...

08:31.960 --> 08:34.960
- I haven't seen her
since ray was...

08:34.960 --> 08:37.260
- where is she, Mrs. Kinzie?

08:41.000 --> 08:43.030
- She's run away before,
but she always comes back

08:43.039 --> 08:44.470
in a day or two.

08:49.010 --> 08:52.580
She and ray
were fighting a lot recently.

08:52.580 --> 08:54.340
- What about?

08:54.350 --> 08:56.450
- I don't know.
She's a teenager.

08:58.050 --> 09:00.350
- Can we see Caitlin's room?

09:01.350 --> 09:05.020
- No phone, no laptop...
There's lots of metal.

09:05.020 --> 09:08.030
- Hmm. Hell hath no fury
like a teenage girl.

09:08.030 --> 09:10.490
My daughter and I
went from best friends

09:10.500 --> 09:12.900
to mortal enemies overnight.

09:12.900 --> 09:15.330
Nothing can prepare you for
the wrath of your spawn.

09:18.840 --> 09:20.400
- Nope.

09:23.310 --> 09:24.940
She got a thing for birds.

09:26.410 --> 09:28.780
Lex Talionis?
- It's Latin.

09:28.780 --> 09:32.350
Means "eye for an eye."
- I'm impressed.

09:32.350 --> 09:35.490
- Head altar boy at St. John's.

09:35.490 --> 09:37.990
Free wine and incense.
What's not to like?

09:41.330 --> 09:43.630
- Looks like Caitlin was
a regular at cafe jumping bean.

09:43.630 --> 09:46.360
Maybe the barista knows
who she hangs out with.

09:49.870 --> 09:51.440
- May-December?

09:51.440 --> 09:52.640
It's my bread and butter.

09:52.640 --> 09:55.910
That's why they call this
the Viagra triangle.

09:55.910 --> 09:57.610
- All right.

09:57.610 --> 10:01.080
- Uh...
Yeah, sure.

10:01.080 --> 10:04.050
I think I seen her,
but the under-30s,

10:04.050 --> 10:06.120
they all start to look the same.

10:06.120 --> 10:08.420
What about this guy?

10:09.350 --> 10:12.120
- Oh, now him...
Him I recognize, yeah.

10:12.120 --> 10:13.560
Yeah, he was with the honey.

10:13.560 --> 10:16.130
Mm-hmm.
- How often?

10:16.130 --> 10:17.890
- Couple three times.

10:17.900 --> 10:20.400
He's the one
shot outside, right?

10:20.400 --> 10:22.570
- What can you tell me
about them?

10:22.570 --> 10:25.100
- He was Grey goose;
She was Miller lite.

10:25.100 --> 10:26.970
- The other night, did they
come in together?

10:26.970 --> 10:29.540
- No, she was at the bar alone.

10:29.540 --> 10:31.540
I remember because she ordered
the fried calamari

10:31.540 --> 10:33.010
and then didn't touch it.

10:33.010 --> 10:36.380
Then he turns up maybe
ten minutes later and digs in.

10:37.950 --> 10:39.080
- You didn't happen to hear

10:39.080 --> 10:40.880
what they were talking about,
did you?

10:40.890 --> 10:42.990
- When he sat down,
she says right away,

10:42.990 --> 10:45.060
"did you tell her yet?"

10:45.060 --> 10:46.460
Something like that.

10:50.660 --> 10:52.930
- Have you seen this girl?

10:59.140 --> 11:01.510
- I got her.

11:03.470 --> 11:05.110
- Caitlin, stop!

11:16.920 --> 11:17.920
Uhh!

11:22.690 --> 11:24.690
- Ow!
What the hell?!

11:31.040 --> 11:33.140
- Bitch bit me.

11:37.180 --> 11:40.040
- Lex Talionis, baby.

11:40.050 --> 11:42.450
- Yeah.
- Should've bit her back.

11:47.620 --> 11:51.820
<i>- Friday night, I got my tattoo
at the ink tank on Belmont.</i>

11:51.820 --> 11:53.220
<i>Is that a crime now?</i>

11:53.230 --> 11:56.460
- It is if you're under 18.
- Barbara signed for me.

11:56.460 --> 11:57.830
- We both know that's crap,
Caitlin.

11:57.830 --> 11:59.460
- Get away from me!

11:59.470 --> 12:00.730
- And you got
"an eye for an eye"

12:00.730 --> 12:02.770
because you're a fan of Gandhi?

12:02.770 --> 12:04.700
- Yeah, this is America.

12:04.700 --> 12:06.770
I live with a judge, remember?
I know my rights.

12:06.770 --> 12:08.170
- We asked if you
wanted a lawyer.

12:08.170 --> 12:10.810
You said no.
- Yeah, but I'm a minor.

12:10.810 --> 12:12.640
- And we have a subpoena.

12:12.640 --> 12:14.580
- If you're gonna go all
constitutional on us,

12:14.580 --> 12:18.250
for resisting arrest,
assaulting a police officer,

12:18.250 --> 12:19.780
and obstructing
an investigation.

12:19.790 --> 12:21.720
- Why don't you
just suck my ass?

12:21.720 --> 12:24.720
- Wow. No wonder
you haven't been adopted.

12:26.860 --> 12:28.530
- Okay.

12:29.860 --> 12:31.860
Mrs. Kinzie said you were
fighting with the judge.

12:31.860 --> 12:33.530
What about?

12:33.530 --> 12:36.530
- I said he was a douche.
He disagreed.

12:36.540 --> 12:37.900
- Maybe we can be more specific.

12:37.900 --> 12:40.570
- The dude monitored my phone
like I was 12.

12:40.570 --> 12:43.240
He inspected my outfit like he
was the frickin' fashion police.

12:43.240 --> 12:47.210
That's what a father...
- he's not my father!

12:49.880 --> 12:51.750
He didn't care about me.

12:51.750 --> 12:53.550
<i>I was just his rent-a-kid</i>

12:53.550 --> 12:57.220
to ease his rich suburban guilt.

12:57.890 --> 12:59.520
- Did he hurt you?

12:59.530 --> 13:01.830
Because if he did...
- huh? No. Gross.

13:02.590 --> 13:04.560
<i>Are we done here?</i>

13:04.560 --> 13:07.560
- Not even close.

13:07.570 --> 13:08.690
- Give me a minute with her.

13:15.210 --> 13:16.810
- Watch out.
She bites.

13:28.220 --> 13:29.920
<i>- I'm Asa Valdez.</i>

13:29.920 --> 13:31.320
- Yeah?

13:31.320 --> 13:33.290
Your mommy coming to pick you up
after work?

13:33.290 --> 13:34.320
- I know yours was doing life

13:34.330 --> 13:36.730
until she was Shanked
in the shower.

13:36.730 --> 13:38.330
- Yeah.

13:39.830 --> 13:42.570
Well, it's tough being
a crack whore.

13:43.800 --> 13:45.340
- The Kinzies took you in.

13:45.340 --> 13:47.000
They cleaned you up,
gave you a home.

13:47.010 --> 13:49.310
- Like I said, guilt makes
people do all k...

13:49.310 --> 13:51.880
- still, you took a bat
to the windows of his car.

13:51.880 --> 13:55.980
He could've had you arrested,
but he didn't.

13:55.980 --> 13:57.980
Why is that, Caitlin?

13:59.580 --> 14:01.280
- You're Anna Valdez.

14:04.360 --> 14:06.920
He said
I could be just like you.

14:09.760 --> 14:12.730
- I don't think you
killed him, Caitlin,

14:12.730 --> 14:14.360
but I got to tell you,
things are not looking good

14:14.370 --> 14:16.700
for you right now.
- Like I care.

14:16.700 --> 14:19.640
- You care a lot.
I know you do.

14:21.710 --> 14:24.310
Judge Kinzie showed me
the birthday card you gave him.

14:24.310 --> 14:27.940
You wrote, "thank you
for saving my life."

14:28.850 --> 14:33.050
The Kinzies were the best thing
that ever happened to you.

14:33.050 --> 14:34.720
If you were gonna kill him,

14:34.720 --> 14:37.390
why'd you break his
car windows first?

14:37.390 --> 14:38.760
That only points
all fingers at you.

14:38.760 --> 14:41.390
I know you're smarter than that.

14:41.390 --> 14:44.360
Ray told me about
your boyfriend's death.

14:44.360 --> 14:46.000
Tell me about Orlando.

14:47.830 --> 14:49.830
- Oh, my god.

14:53.700 --> 14:55.870
You were screwing him.

14:57.080 --> 14:59.380
- Can I speak with you?
- Did you kill him?

14:59.380 --> 15:01.010
- Now!

15:03.080 --> 15:05.050
Sit down!

15:06.280 --> 15:08.690
- Look who just got bit.
- Yeah.

15:12.360 --> 15:14.390
- I thought I could help.
- I don't want to hear it.

15:14.390 --> 15:15.760
I told you to stay away
from this case.

15:15.760 --> 15:19.030
- You're wasting your time.
- Go home.

15:20.030 --> 15:22.100
- Caitlin didn't kill Kinzie.

15:28.840 --> 15:31.010
- She did seem to know a lot
about the girl.

15:31.010 --> 15:34.040
- if they were,
a competent defense attorney

15:34.050 --> 15:36.150
will discredit anything
we learn from her.

15:36.150 --> 15:38.450
- And if they weren't?
- She's still a witness.

15:38.450 --> 15:41.380
If she's involved
as part of the prosecution team,

15:41.390 --> 15:44.920
her testimony will be tainted.
- Right.

15:44.920 --> 15:46.060
Looks like we have
to start digging

15:46.060 --> 15:48.960
through Caitlin's
foster care files.

15:48.960 --> 15:50.960
- Good luck.
- Heh.

15:57.800 --> 16:00.070
- Damn,
this girl had a rough life.

16:00.070 --> 16:01.400
Kinzie must've been a Saint.

16:01.410 --> 16:04.070
- Hmm, and father
Jack Calahan agrees.

16:04.080 --> 16:06.980
And I quote, "there are no
better foster candidates"

16:06.980 --> 16:10.410
than the Kinzies."
Everybody loves this guy.

16:10.420 --> 16:12.150
- Maybe that's his blessing
and his curse.

16:12.150 --> 16:14.020
Good-looking guy like Kinzie,

16:14.020 --> 16:18.150
hanging out in a bar
on a Friday night...

16:18.160 --> 16:20.820
If he were my husband,
I might be jealous.

16:20.830 --> 16:22.360
- And you'd hire somebody
to whack him?

16:22.360 --> 16:24.730
- It's easier than divorce.

16:24.730 --> 16:28.400
- Tell me about it.
Listen to this.

16:28.400 --> 16:31.970
"I heard Raymond Kinzie
wants to be a foster parent.

16:31.970 --> 16:33.840
"He's an awful judge
and an awful man

16:33.840 --> 16:36.110
"who hates women
and protects rapists.

16:36.110 --> 16:37.840
"Not only should he
be off the bench,

16:37.840 --> 16:39.110
"he should be off the planet.

16:39.110 --> 16:41.510
If you don't stop this, I will."

16:41.510 --> 16:45.980
- Signed?
- "A gravely concerned citizen."

16:45.980 --> 16:48.120
Now that's some anal-retentive
penmanship.

16:48.120 --> 16:50.190
I mean, who the hell even
writes a letter these days?

16:50.190 --> 16:53.490
- Someone whose rapist is being
protected by judge Kinzie?

17:00.870 --> 17:03.900
In his 15 years on the bench,

17:03.900 --> 17:06.839
Kinzie tried 47 rapes.

17:08.040 --> 17:10.140
- Maybe we can narrow it down
with this.

17:13.079 --> 17:15.550
- Nagel confirmed
Caitlin's alibi.

17:15.550 --> 17:16.980
- I figured as much.

17:23.819 --> 17:25.920
Why don't you just ask me?

17:26.890 --> 17:28.560
- Ask you what?

17:28.560 --> 17:31.560
- Ask me,
or I'm walking out that door.

17:33.900 --> 17:36.930
- Were you sleeping with him?
- That's none of your business.

17:36.940 --> 17:40.440
- Then say no.
- I shouldn't have to.

17:40.440 --> 17:43.240
- There are...
Ethics rules.

17:44.910 --> 17:47.240
- Do you think I'd do
anything unethical?

17:49.110 --> 17:50.580
- Who were you referring to

17:50.580 --> 17:53.850
when you asked Kinzie
if he had told her yet?

17:57.120 --> 17:58.320
You're amazing.

18:01.130 --> 18:03.460
- Look, I understand why

18:03.460 --> 18:05.530
you're protecting
judge Kinzie's memory.

18:05.530 --> 18:08.570
- You're very smart, Peter.

18:08.570 --> 18:11.470
Probably the smartest
person I know,

18:11.470 --> 18:13.270
but you're way off base on this.

18:21.280 --> 18:23.550
Dinner was a nice touch, though.

18:29.490 --> 18:33.860
- All it took
was a little TLC...

18:33.860 --> 18:37.030
Thin-layer chromatography.

18:37.960 --> 18:41.900
Funny, huh?
- Yeah. A riot.

18:41.900 --> 18:47.140
Your letter was written on
limited-edition stationary

18:47.140 --> 18:49.640
made by the berwyn press
in Oregon.

18:49.640 --> 18:52.310
- Limited as in it wasn't
sold in that many stores?

18:52.310 --> 18:55.040
- One in Chicago, to be precise.

18:55.050 --> 18:57.510
- You're kidding.
- I had some free time

18:57.520 --> 19:00.020
while you were drinking
coffee downstairs,

19:00.020 --> 19:04.250
Stationary store near
central Chicago U.

19:04.260 --> 19:06.320
- Do you mind?

19:08.260 --> 19:10.890
Okay, let's see.

19:10.900 --> 19:13.530
Kinzie tried three rape cases

19:13.530 --> 19:16.170
involving women at CCU.

19:16.170 --> 19:19.570
Ex-boyfriend charged,
blah blah...

19:19.570 --> 19:21.270
Sentenced to 20 years.

19:21.270 --> 19:23.110
The second case was dismissed

19:23.110 --> 19:25.610
after the victim
recanted her testimony.

19:26.940 --> 19:28.240
And finally...

19:28.250 --> 19:31.680
- Seven years ago,
Stan Kendricks,

19:31.680 --> 19:33.220
a member of the varsity
tennis team,

19:33.220 --> 19:35.220
raped a freshman, Zoe Butler.

19:35.220 --> 19:36.650
18 years old.
Bench trial.

19:36.660 --> 19:39.020
Served five months.

19:39.020 --> 19:41.120
- I'd think about
killing over that.

19:45.230 --> 19:48.330
- I didn't think I could
ever forget what happened.

19:48.330 --> 19:51.230
I kept replaying it in my head,

19:51.240 --> 19:54.200
and then one day,
I was like, "screw this."

19:54.210 --> 19:58.170
I'm not gonna let him
take my power away."

19:58.180 --> 20:01.010
So I started coming
to these meetings.

20:01.010 --> 20:03.980
And I felt better right away.

20:03.980 --> 20:05.320
- Damn.
Gimme a minute.

20:05.320 --> 20:07.380
- It was nice to know
I wasn't the only one.

20:07.390 --> 20:10.250
- Hey.

20:10.260 --> 20:12.360
How you been?
- Good.

20:12.360 --> 20:15.290
Didn't recognize you
out of uniform.

20:15.290 --> 20:16.260
I didn't know...

20:16.260 --> 20:18.730
- It happened before the job.

20:18.730 --> 20:21.970
I still come to these things.
I don't know why.

20:21.970 --> 20:23.630
- We're looking for Zoe Butler.

20:23.640 --> 20:26.040
Her neighbor said
she hangs at this church.

20:26.040 --> 20:28.340
- If it's your first time,
you're safe.

20:28.340 --> 20:31.340
- Right there.
Red sweatshirt.

20:31.340 --> 20:33.310
- And we're really glad
you're here.

20:34.450 --> 20:37.280
- Zoe Butler?
- Yes?

20:37.280 --> 20:40.250
- You have a minute?
- Do I know you?

20:40.250 --> 20:42.220
- We're from the state's
attorney's office.

20:49.390 --> 20:52.360
- This is about
judge Kinzie, right?

20:52.360 --> 20:54.260
- It is.

20:54.270 --> 20:57.130
- Well, I can't say
I'm upset that he's dead,

20:57.140 --> 21:00.240
- We'd love to take
your word for it, but...

21:00.240 --> 21:02.670
- Friday night I was here, okay?

21:02.670 --> 21:04.770
Lots of witnesses.

21:04.780 --> 21:06.380
Look, if I was going
to kill someone,

21:06.380 --> 21:08.480
it'd be Stan.
- The guy who raped you?

21:08.480 --> 21:09.680
- That's right.

21:09.680 --> 21:11.710
Unfortunately,
he left the country,

21:11.720 --> 21:13.680
and I'm not about
to spend a nickel

21:13.690 --> 21:15.320
chasing that prick down.

21:16.650 --> 21:18.290
So are you going to arrest me,

21:18.290 --> 21:20.390
or can I get a piece of Babka?

21:21.290 --> 21:23.390
- Help yourself.

21:26.030 --> 21:27.330
- She seems to have moved on.

21:27.330 --> 21:29.770
- Mm. I wonder if
Kinzie's death helped.

21:32.670 --> 21:34.670
Hey.

21:34.670 --> 21:37.270
Zoe's, uh, elimination prints
in her rape file...

21:37.280 --> 21:39.510
They matched the ones
on the bullets.

21:45.480 --> 21:50.250
Look, I have 30 women
who will testify

21:50.260 --> 21:52.560
that I was at a meeting
when Kinzie was shot.

21:52.560 --> 21:55.290
- And we have bullets
with your prints on them.

21:55.290 --> 21:59.500
- So we toss a century
of forensic science?

21:59.500 --> 22:01.130
- Science, right.

22:01.130 --> 22:04.170
After Stan raped me,
there were doctors

22:04.170 --> 22:06.540
and psychiatrists
and social workers,

22:06.540 --> 22:09.840
and they all said I
imagined the whole thing.

22:09.840 --> 22:12.240
- The system screwed up
in your case, Zoe.

22:12.240 --> 22:15.310
It happens,
but from where we're sitting,

22:15.310 --> 22:17.410
if anyone had motive, it's you.

22:19.120 --> 22:21.850
- Five months for rape?

22:21.850 --> 22:25.350
- The good judge knocked it down
to criminal sexual abuse.

22:25.360 --> 22:28.590
Sentenced him to a year.
He was released in five months.

22:28.590 --> 22:31.090
- You must've been furious.

22:31.100 --> 22:33.860
- I don't know why
you'd possibly say that.

22:33.870 --> 22:36.600
I just went to party,
had too much to drink,

22:36.600 --> 22:40.570
asked a friend to walk me home,
and blacked out.

22:40.570 --> 22:43.540
Next thing I know,
I woke up in the grass

22:43.540 --> 22:45.540
in Lincoln park
with his penis in my mouth

22:45.540 --> 22:47.540
and him humping my face.

22:49.280 --> 22:53.150
He left me there
with his semen all over my neck.

22:53.150 --> 22:56.520
Then the great Kinzie...
He looks down from the bench

22:56.520 --> 22:58.520
at the rest of us mere mortals
and says,

22:58.520 --> 23:02.390
"Zoe, I'm gonna rape you again."

23:02.390 --> 23:04.530
- And that's why you killed him.

23:04.530 --> 23:06.530
- Screw you.

23:06.530 --> 23:08.360
I've spent the last seven years

23:08.370 --> 23:09.630
trying to put this behind me,

23:09.630 --> 23:11.270
but it seems that rape

23:11.270 --> 23:13.370
is the gift that
keeps on giving.

23:15.440 --> 23:17.540
Lucky me.

23:26.620 --> 23:29.190
- Sorry.
Traffic.

23:29.190 --> 23:30.550
- What's the big secret?

23:30.560 --> 23:32.560
- No secret.
I just thought you should know

23:32.560 --> 23:34.320
that we arrested a suspect.

23:35.530 --> 23:38.730
- Hey, where's it written
that I can't have a drink

23:38.730 --> 23:40.500
with a girlfriend?

23:42.530 --> 23:44.270
- So who killed ray?

23:44.270 --> 23:45.940
- A woman named Zoe Butler.

23:45.940 --> 23:47.400
- I know who Zoe is.

23:47.410 --> 23:49.270
If everyone has a cross to bear,

23:49.270 --> 23:50.470
she was Ray's.

23:50.480 --> 23:52.640
- Did she harass him?
Threaten him?

23:52.640 --> 23:55.410
- Not Zoe per se,
but the case...

23:55.410 --> 23:57.710
Or rather, how he decided it.

23:59.550 --> 24:01.650
- Kinzie really messed up.

24:01.650 --> 24:05.520
He never read what the papers
said about his decisions,

24:05.520 --> 24:07.690
but the Zoe Butler case
was different.

24:09.430 --> 24:12.500
For some reason,
he couldn't shake that case.

24:12.500 --> 24:14.530
- We all pick at scabs.

24:14.530 --> 24:17.470
- It was horrible
what they wrote about him...

24:17.470 --> 24:20.240
Some vicious articles.

24:20.240 --> 24:23.410
- How many ways can you say
sexist pig?

24:23.410 --> 24:24.640
- I'll show you.

24:30.210 --> 24:32.320
- May I?

24:32.780 --> 24:35.450
- Yeah.

24:35.450 --> 24:38.650
- That's familiar.
I know that handwriting.

24:39.660 --> 24:43.290
Who's she?
- I have no idea.

24:53.470 --> 24:56.740
- It would really help
if you could ID this woman.

24:58.710 --> 25:00.440
- I'm not gonna testify.

25:00.450 --> 25:03.280
- Hey.
This is between us.

25:04.620 --> 25:06.320
- It's important, Anita.

25:06.320 --> 25:08.580
This woman threatened
judge Kinzie's life.

25:08.590 --> 25:09.850
Torrent downloaded from RARBG.

25:09.850 --> 25:12.390
She's a rape victim advocate.

25:12.390 --> 25:14.520
Her name's Wendy Hoult.

25:15.490 --> 25:18.460
- You're darn right I wrote it.

25:18.460 --> 25:22.730
How did you know Kinzie was
applying to be a foster parent?

25:22.730 --> 25:26.340
- I know plenty of people
in children and family services.

25:26.340 --> 25:29.310
They how I think
the judicial system is rigged.

25:29.310 --> 25:30.540
- The whole system?

25:30.540 --> 25:32.680
Or just the system
in the Zoe Butler case?

25:32.680 --> 25:34.780
You see?

25:34.780 --> 25:36.880
It wasn't the Zoe Butler case.

25:36.880 --> 25:39.320
It was the Stan Kendricks case.

25:39.320 --> 25:40.780
Zoe was the victim.

25:40.790 --> 25:44.690
But to answer your question,
the entire system is rigged.

25:44.690 --> 25:46.520
- Where were you last Friday?

25:46.520 --> 25:48.620
- In St. Louis at a conference.

25:48.630 --> 25:51.590
I just got home this morning,
as a matter of fact.

25:52.560 --> 25:54.900
So...
Two investigators show up

25:54.900 --> 25:56.700
asking about
a seven-year-old rape.

25:56.700 --> 25:59.440
What am I missing?

25:59.440 --> 26:03.540
- Judge Kinzie was murdered.
- What?

26:03.540 --> 26:07.410
Oh, my god.
I didn't think he meant it.

26:07.410 --> 26:09.450
- Who?
- Uh, Jon Hoffman,

26:09.450 --> 26:12.520
Zoe Butler's husband...
Ex-husband.

26:12.520 --> 26:15.320
He stopped by last Thursday

26:15.320 --> 26:17.620
saying, uh, there was no
justice in the world

26:17.620 --> 26:20.390
and this was all judge Kinzie's
fault, and...

26:20.390 --> 26:22.830
He said Kinzie would
pay for what he did.

26:22.830 --> 26:25.490
- Did he say how
Kinzie would pay?

26:26.530 --> 26:28.530
- He said he deserved
to be dead.

26:28.530 --> 26:32.370
I thought he was just
ranting like he always does.

26:35.340 --> 26:37.440
- Thank you.

26:41.350 --> 26:45.350
- Friday night?
I was here, watching TV.

26:45.350 --> 26:47.580
- Uh, what'd you watch?

26:47.590 --> 26:50.590
- I don't remember.
Whatever was on.

26:50.590 --> 26:53.490
Did I do something?

26:53.490 --> 26:55.860
- We're here about your ex.

26:55.860 --> 26:57.730
- Zoe?
- Mm-hmm.

26:57.730 --> 27:00.500
- Is she okay?
- Actually, she's been arrested.

27:00.500 --> 27:02.630
- For killing judge Kinzie.

27:02.630 --> 27:05.370
- Wha... who?
- Come on.

27:05.370 --> 27:08.400
The judge who presided
over her rape case.

27:10.680 --> 27:13.880
Her prints were on bullets
in the murder weapon.

27:13.880 --> 27:17.580
- No way.
She hated guns.

27:17.580 --> 27:19.550
I bought her one; We went
to the shooting range once.

27:19.550 --> 27:22.550
She said never again.

27:22.550 --> 27:24.590
She left it here
when we split up.

27:24.590 --> 27:26.520
- Great. Can we see it?

27:26.520 --> 27:28.890
- No.

27:28.890 --> 27:31.760
They stole the gun,
bunch of other stuff.

27:31.760 --> 27:33.630
I filed a report with the cops.

27:33.630 --> 27:36.600
They told me not to get
my hopes up.

27:36.600 --> 27:38.700
Look, that's why her prints
are on the bullets.

27:38.700 --> 27:40.970
There's no way she
would've killed anyone.

27:40.970 --> 27:43.510
- That's what we figured.

27:43.510 --> 27:45.710
- Those are nice goggles.
What kind of bike you ride?

27:48.550 --> 27:50.810
- Those are my brother's.

27:50.820 --> 27:52.780
- Well, you mind if I take
a look at his bike?

27:52.780 --> 27:54.950
I'm thinking about getting one.

27:54.950 --> 27:57.520
- I really have
to get back to work.

27:57.520 --> 27:59.690
- That wasn't a request.

28:13.640 --> 28:15.940
Sweet.

28:15.940 --> 28:17.840
- I told my brother
he could store it here

28:17.840 --> 28:21.640
while he's in Iraq.
He's in the army.

28:21.650 --> 28:24.550
- Be sure to thank him
for his service.

28:24.550 --> 28:26.050
- Yeah, I will.

28:31.690 --> 28:33.860
- Right. Turn around.
Face the wall.

28:33.860 --> 28:36.630
- What for?
- Just do it, please.

28:40.730 --> 28:43.770
Jon Hoffman, you're under arrest

28:43.770 --> 28:46.100
for the murder
of judge Raymond Kinzie.

28:52.640 --> 28:56.680
I'm... I'm just lost as to

28:56.680 --> 28:58.910
why a man would kill the judge
who wronged his ex

28:58.920 --> 29:00.580
seven years ago.

29:00.590 --> 29:03.920
But just reading all the witness
statements you sent me,

29:03.920 --> 29:07.090
I would say that revenge
is a pretty good place to start.

29:07.090 --> 29:09.690
- But they weren't together
when she was attacked.

29:10.990 --> 29:15.630
- As society, we tend to focus
on the trauma of the survivor.

29:15.630 --> 29:18.070
But what we're learning is
that the tentacles of rape

29:18.070 --> 29:20.670
spread far and wide.

29:20.670 --> 29:25.070
The extraordinarily violent
and violating nature of the act

29:25.080 --> 29:26.940
creates this ripple effect

29:26.940 --> 29:29.880
that touches anyone who has
had any relationship

29:29.880 --> 29:31.680
with the survivor.

29:31.680 --> 29:34.620
Family members, friends,
coworkers.

29:34.620 --> 29:36.050
- Mm. Ex-husbands?

29:36.050 --> 29:37.550
- Why not?

29:37.560 --> 29:40.020
You know, Jon hears
that Zoe got raped.

29:40.020 --> 29:44.660
Well, one response to feeling
helpless is to lash out

29:44.660 --> 29:46.530
at the source of those feelings.

29:46.530 --> 29:49.530
So he went after the guy
who set him free:

29:49.530 --> 29:50.670
Judge Kinzie.

29:50.670 --> 29:53.140
- One more question:
Why now?

29:53.140 --> 29:56.540
- Why not now?
We all have our triggers.

29:56.540 --> 29:58.140
Right? I mean...

29:58.140 --> 30:00.080
He could've found a pair
of Zoe's socks

30:00.080 --> 30:01.710
in the back of a drawer.

30:01.710 --> 30:03.850
He could've seen her
crossing the street.

30:03.850 --> 30:06.120
You know, the nature of triggers
is just so random.

30:06.120 --> 30:07.680
They come out of nowhere.

30:07.690 --> 30:09.750
I mean, who knows what
might've set him off?

30:13.920 --> 30:17.130
- I haven't spoken to Jon
in three years,

30:17.130 --> 30:18.690
since our divorce.

30:18.700 --> 30:20.930
- Did he divorce you?

30:20.930 --> 30:22.930
- No. I left him.

30:22.930 --> 30:24.830
- Tell me about the marriage.

30:24.840 --> 30:28.600
- When I first met Jon,
he was wonderful.

30:28.610 --> 30:30.910
For the first time
in a long time,

30:30.910 --> 30:32.740
I actually felt safe.

30:32.740 --> 30:34.180
- Since you were raped?

30:34.180 --> 30:38.610
- Did you tell Jon about the
rape before you were married?

30:38.620 --> 30:41.050
- No, I was ashamed,

30:41.050 --> 30:42.720
but when I did tell him

30:42.720 --> 30:45.020
about what Stan Kendricks
did to me,

30:45.020 --> 30:46.660
he changed.

30:46.660 --> 30:48.990
He put triple locks
on all the doors.

30:48.990 --> 30:51.860
He insisted on driving me
to work every day

30:51.860 --> 30:53.600
and picking me up.

30:53.600 --> 30:57.730
He bought me a gun and wanted me
to carry it in my purse.

30:57.740 --> 30:59.800
- Did you?
- No.

30:59.800 --> 31:01.900
I hid it in my closet.

31:03.740 --> 31:06.680
- I show you what's been marked
as people's exhibit 12.

31:11.750 --> 31:13.620
Is this the gun that
Jon bought for you?

31:13.620 --> 31:15.050
- It looks like it.

31:15.050 --> 31:17.750
I don't really know.

31:17.760 --> 31:20.160
- You didn't like that Jon
was trying to keep you safe?

31:20.160 --> 31:21.820
- I'd wake up in the middle
of the night,

31:21.830 --> 31:24.690
and he was sitting in a chair,
staring at me.

31:24.700 --> 31:27.030
I went to lunch
with people from work,

31:27.030 --> 31:29.030
and I saw him outside.

31:29.030 --> 31:30.270
He was obsessed.

31:30.270 --> 31:32.840
- When you moved out,
did you take the gun?

31:32.840 --> 31:36.740
- No. I had forgotten
about it by then.

31:36.740 --> 31:38.240
- Last question.

31:38.240 --> 31:40.810
Why did you divorce Jon?

31:42.280 --> 31:45.180
- He only saw me as a victim.

31:45.180 --> 31:47.180
He never saw me as a survivor.

31:51.290 --> 31:53.920
- When you were first
brought in for questioning,

31:53.920 --> 31:55.660
did you tell the investigators

31:55.660 --> 31:58.790
that Jon had bought you
this gun?

31:58.800 --> 32:02.670
- But did you tell them
that Jon owned a gun?

32:02.670 --> 32:05.130
- No.
- Why not?

32:06.740 --> 32:09.140
- I don't know.
I didn't think about it.

32:09.140 --> 32:11.710
- But when Mr. stone asked you
why you were divorced,

32:11.710 --> 32:14.740
one of the reasons you gave
was this gun.

32:14.750 --> 32:16.980
Wait a minute, did you even
tell the investigators

32:16.980 --> 32:19.010
you had been married?

32:20.250 --> 32:22.690
- No.

32:22.690 --> 32:24.790
- All due respect, Ms. Butler,

32:24.790 --> 32:27.060
but that's a little weird,
don't you think?

32:27.060 --> 32:29.960
I mean, they were accusing you
of murdering judge Kinzie,

32:29.960 --> 32:33.830
and you forgot to tell them
that your overly protective ex

32:33.830 --> 32:37.070
owned a gun just like
the murder weapon?

32:37.970 --> 32:40.240
- Talking about Jon is painful.

32:40.240 --> 32:42.710
- Because he tried his best
to love and protect you?

32:42.710 --> 32:44.940
- Because everything he did...

32:44.940 --> 32:47.240
It was like...

32:47.240 --> 32:49.880
He made me re-live the rape
every day.

32:49.880 --> 32:52.280
- Which, let's face it,
gave you a huge motive

32:52.280 --> 32:54.080
to want judge Kinzie dead.

32:54.090 --> 32:56.790
- Objection.
- Sustained.

33:00.820 --> 33:02.260
- I was at my car.

33:02.260 --> 33:05.030
- Outside of Sheridan's bar?
- Yes.

33:05.030 --> 33:07.100
- How many drinks did you have?
- Two.

33:07.100 --> 33:09.200
- And you would say
you were inebriated?

33:09.200 --> 33:10.730
- No.
- Tell the court

33:10.740 --> 33:12.000
what happened then.

33:12.000 --> 33:15.240
- I heard four gunshots
when I got to my car.

33:15.240 --> 33:18.110
I turned around and saw
a motorcycle speeding toward me.

33:19.310 --> 33:21.010
- Was there anything
in particular you noticed

33:21.010 --> 33:22.340
about the motorcycle?

33:22.350 --> 33:25.050
- I saw an orange flash
on the front windscreen...

33:25.050 --> 33:27.880
A sticker of some sort.

33:27.890 --> 33:30.050
- In your time at cook county
state's attorney's office,

33:30.050 --> 33:35.960
- Yes, I have been your
second chair on several trials.

33:40.060 --> 33:43.230
- Could you see judge Kinzie's
face when he was on the ground?

33:44.170 --> 33:45.170
- No.

33:45.170 --> 33:47.400
- Then how'd you
know it was him?

33:47.400 --> 33:50.170
- We left Sheridan's
at the same time.

33:50.170 --> 33:53.110
- Was that a coincidence,
Ms. Valdez?

33:53.110 --> 33:54.910
- No.

33:54.910 --> 33:56.880
- Tell us about it,
why don't you?

33:58.110 --> 34:00.780
- We had drinks together.

34:00.790 --> 34:02.150
- Was this the first time?

34:03.820 --> 34:05.390
- No.

34:05.390 --> 34:07.190
- May we approach, your honor?

34:11.060 --> 34:13.060
In light of the people's
failure to disclose

34:13.060 --> 34:15.030
the romantic relationship
between this witness

34:15.030 --> 34:16.170
and the victim,

34:16.170 --> 34:19.230
I move to exclude
all of her testimony.

34:19.239 --> 34:21.400
- First of all, we know
of no romantic relationship.

34:21.409 --> 34:27.080
I'm ready to put the bartender
from Sheridan's on the stand.

34:27.080 --> 34:29.239
I'm sure she told you
exactly what she told me.

34:30.449 --> 34:32.210
- Which is?

34:32.219 --> 34:34.449
- The first thing the witness
said to judge Kinzie was,

34:34.449 --> 34:37.889
and I quote,
"did you tell her yet?"

34:39.020 --> 34:42.219
You don't have to be married
to know what that means.

34:42.230 --> 34:44.360
- The jury can consider
this evidence.

34:44.360 --> 34:45.429
- Thank you, your honor.

34:45.429 --> 34:47.360
- Don't thank me yet, Mr. stone.

34:47.360 --> 34:50.230
You can expect
an instruction so harsh

34:50.230 --> 34:53.370
that the jury will disregard
Ms. Valdez's testimony

34:53.370 --> 34:55.469
on their own.

35:20.200 --> 35:21.430
Valdez.

35:23.400 --> 35:25.200
Send her up.

35:28.200 --> 35:31.340
- Thank you for seeing me.

35:31.340 --> 35:34.410
My friend told me what
happened in court today.

35:35.950 --> 35:37.910
I want to apologize
if I caused you...

35:37.920 --> 35:40.880
- I'm fine.

35:40.890 --> 35:42.950
- It never ends.

35:42.950 --> 35:46.220
- I'm so sorry you have
to go through this again.

35:46.220 --> 35:49.360
- Everyone thinks I
should hate judge Kinzie.

35:49.360 --> 35:52.090
But the truth is,

35:52.100 --> 35:55.630
Stan Kendricks getting
such a short sentence...

35:55.630 --> 35:58.230
It was my fault.

35:58.240 --> 36:00.140
- No, it wasn't, Zoe.

36:00.140 --> 36:03.310
- I met with the probation
officer prior to sentencing.

36:03.310 --> 36:06.210
She asked me what I wanted.

36:06.210 --> 36:08.940
After living through
the nightmare

36:08.950 --> 36:11.150
and re-living it
in the courtroom,

36:11.150 --> 36:13.380
I still...

36:13.380 --> 36:16.050
I know this sounds weird,

36:16.050 --> 36:19.420
but I still felt sorry for Stan.

36:21.120 --> 36:23.160
It's crazy, but I felt like...

36:23.160 --> 36:26.130
I was going to ruin
Stan's whole life

36:26.130 --> 36:28.060
because he made
one stupid mistake.

36:30.200 --> 36:33.440
That went into
the P.O.'S report.

36:33.440 --> 36:36.410
Judge Kinzie
just did what I asked.

36:38.010 --> 36:39.410
- Wow.

36:41.340 --> 36:44.450
- I know.
I am stupid.

36:44.450 --> 36:48.280
After lots of therapy,
I realized just how stupid.

36:48.290 --> 36:50.490
I should've paid for that,
not judge Kinzie.

36:52.360 --> 36:55.060
- You are not responsible
for what Jon did.

37:00.430 --> 37:02.460
- I've taken enough
of your time.

37:04.330 --> 37:06.440
I should be the happiest
girl on the planet...

37:06.440 --> 37:09.170
Starting a new chapter
in my life with my fiancé.

37:09.170 --> 37:13.180
- I didn't want Blake
to get dragged into this mess.

37:13.180 --> 37:16.980
I mean, he knows, but...

37:24.450 --> 37:27.520
- Off the record?

37:27.520 --> 37:29.260
- Yeah, come in.

37:29.260 --> 37:31.160
I probably lost the case anyway.

37:34.400 --> 37:36.200
- I don't know
if I ever said it,

37:36.200 --> 37:38.530
but I am sorry about Kinzie.

37:44.240 --> 37:47.410
- This is exactly what
ray dreaded most...

37:47.410 --> 37:49.510
A case in which the law
gets in the way of justice.

37:51.050 --> 37:54.380
- Like a five-month
sentence for a rape?

37:54.390 --> 37:56.350
- He was just following
the probation officer's

37:56.350 --> 37:57.490
Presentencing report.

37:57.490 --> 38:00.290
- Martha Stewart
served more time.

38:00.290 --> 38:03.230
- And Teddy Kennedy
never served a day.

38:04.360 --> 38:06.090
- Touché.

38:08.160 --> 38:09.300
- If I learned one thing
from Zoe,

38:09.300 --> 38:10.600
it's to focus on the future.

38:10.600 --> 38:13.300
After all this,
she's getting married.

38:23.110 --> 38:25.380
Good luck in court tomorrow.

38:25.380 --> 38:27.120
- Thank you.

38:31.490 --> 38:34.390
- Can I ask?

38:34.390 --> 38:36.460
- Something Dr. Charles told me.

38:55.450 --> 38:57.850
- Mr. stone.

38:57.850 --> 39:00.520
I'd like you to meet Blake,
my fiancé.

39:00.520 --> 39:02.150
- It's nice to meet you.

39:02.150 --> 39:04.220
It's very kind of you
to come out and support Zoe.

39:04.220 --> 39:05.450
- I love her.
It's the least I could do.

39:05.460 --> 39:07.520
- Uh, when are you
getting married?

39:07.520 --> 39:09.290
- This summer.

39:09.290 --> 39:10.430
- And it's a big wedding?

39:10.430 --> 39:12.360
- All our friends will be there.

39:14.460 --> 39:16.400
- How could you bring him here?

39:16.400 --> 39:18.500
- Sit down, Jon.

39:20.200 --> 39:22.200
- I moved on, Jon.

39:22.210 --> 39:25.440
<i>You</i> moved on.

39:25.440 --> 39:27.510
Kendricks moved on.
- Jon...

39:27.510 --> 39:31.310
- Everybody moved on!
- Jon!

39:31.320 --> 39:34.480
Stop it.
- Everybody moved on but me!

39:34.490 --> 39:35.580
- Is that why you
killed the judge?

39:35.590 --> 39:37.490
- You're damn right it is!

39:51.130 --> 39:53.240
- We should talk.

39:59.610 --> 40:02.180
It's over, Jon.

40:05.450 --> 40:07.550
- How did that happen?

40:07.550 --> 40:09.380
- Zoe announced her engagement
on Facebook

40:09.390 --> 40:12.150
a few days before
Jon killed judge Kinzie.

40:12.160 --> 40:14.260
That's what triggered him.

40:16.160 --> 40:18.460
- I can't believe
he agreed to 30 years.

40:18.460 --> 40:20.560
- A courtroom full of people
heard him confess.

40:33.640 --> 40:36.180
- Let me ask you this.

40:36.180 --> 40:37.650
If I told you I wasn't
sleeping with ray,

40:37.650 --> 40:40.550
would you have believed me?

40:45.290 --> 40:47.190
- I don't know.

40:47.190 --> 40:50.490
Maybe skepticism is some
sort of evolutionary shield

40:50.490 --> 40:52.590
that helps the species survive.

40:53.660 --> 40:55.500
The truth is,
if I flat-out said

40:55.500 --> 40:59.570
there's no way I would
ever sleep with ray,

40:59.570 --> 41:03.210
it wouldn't have changed
your investigation one bit.

41:03.210 --> 41:05.410
We are all endowed
by our creator

41:05.410 --> 41:07.540
with unalienable rights.

41:07.540 --> 41:11.280
I recall reading that
in some old document.

41:11.280 --> 41:15.250
Is the right to be respected
by your fellow man.

41:17.220 --> 41:20.690
If my relationship with ray,
whatever it was,

41:20.690 --> 41:23.260
would've helped you catch
or convict his killer,

41:23.260 --> 41:24.690
I would've told you.

41:24.700 --> 41:29.000
But because I knew it didn't,
I figured I'd rely on...

41:29.000 --> 41:31.500
Another right referenced
in that dusty old document.

41:38.510 --> 41:40.610
- Privacy.
