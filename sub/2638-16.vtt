WEBVTT

00:02.310 --> 00:03.880
That was close.

00:05.730 --> 00:08.970
God, I love the smell of
paintballs in the morning.

00:09.750 --> 00:12.350
Yeah, still funny, Raj.

00:14.430 --> 00:15.750
There's no way we can get to the ridge.

00:15.790 --> 00:17.900
The Chemistry Department
has us completely cut off.

00:17.920 --> 00:19.380
But what about the creek bed?

00:19.410 --> 00:24.590
The Pharmacology Department controls that, and
they're all hopped up on experimental steroids.

00:24.600 --> 00:26.000
That's it then. We're doomed.

00:26.010 --> 00:29.350
I think the time has come to acknowledge
that we are paying the price for some of us

00:29.360 --> 00:32.940
failing to attend my Physics
Department paintball strategy meeting.

00:32.970 --> 00:35.640
I told you my mom has spider veins.

00:35.670 --> 00:39.070
I had to take her to the laser clinic.

00:39.650 --> 00:43.660
And I told you I wante
to see a doctor's note.

00:44.080 --> 00:45.530
We need a plan.

00:45.580 --> 00:47.270
How about Operation Hammer of the Gods?

00:47.290 --> 00:48.850
I forget. Which one
is Hammer of the Gods?

00:48.860 --> 00:53.180
We hide behind the Dumpsters in the parking
lot and ambush people when they come to pee.

00:54.110 --> 00:57.060
No go. The Dumpsters are deep in
Astronomy Department territory.

00:57.070 --> 00:59.020
That shouldn't be a problem.
Venus is up during the day.

00:59.030 --> 01:01.550
They're probably just
all staring at the sky.

01:01.560 --> 01:04.400
All right, what we need
now is a tactical retreat.

01:04.440 --> 01:07.690
Did you see the episode of Stargate
where they found themselves on a planet

01:07.700 --> 01:11.390
with a culture based loosely
on Earth's Athens and Sparta?

01:12.040 --> 01:14.000
Not important.

01:14.010 --> 01:16.620
Leonard, Raj and I are going to
burst out the door and run away.

01:16.650 --> 01:18.180
Howard will cover us.

01:18.210 --> 01:20.060
Why don't I run away and you cover me?

01:20.090 --> 01:23.310
Because you chose your
mother's veins over victory.

01:23.740 --> 01:27.180
On three. One, two, three, go!

01:29.270 --> 01:33.450
I had to take her! It's
almost bathing suit weather!

01:38.810 --> 01:41.990
I surrender! Don't
shoot! They went that way!

01:42.290 --> 01:44.770
Howard, I'm on your team.

01:44.790 --> 01:47.240
Oh, Leslie, thank God.

01:47.820 --> 01:49.470
Where's the rest of your squad?

01:49.500 --> 01:52.650
Ah, they left me here to die.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.150
What about yours?

01:54.190 --> 01:55.980
Dead, all of them.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.150
Sorry.

01:57.190 --> 02:00.730
Don't be. It was friendly fire.

02:02.020 --> 02:04.320
They just wouldn't listen.

02:05.130 --> 02:10.130
Well, we're surrounded, so I
guess there's nothing for us to do

02:10.139 --> 02:13.290
but wait to be captured or killed.

02:13.330 --> 02:17.350
Hmm, that's the worst part, the waiting.

02:17.360 --> 02:22.430
All the while knowing that there's a
paint pellet out there with your namen it.

02:23.190 --> 02:28.010
Yeah, the big wet ball of death.

02:31.610 --> 02:34.950
Kind of makes you feel
more alive, doesn't it?

02:34.960 --> 02:37.590
It kind of does.

02:38.820 --> 02:41.350
I say we make every moment count.

02:41.380 --> 02:44.020
I agree.

02:44.040 --> 02:46.490
How exactly do we do that?

02:49.710 --> 02:54.190
Howard, why aren't you covering us?
We're getting slaughtered out here!

02:54.200 --> 02:56.650
War is hell.

03:20.730 --> 03:22.900
Did you guys see the new budget
memo that went out this morning?

03:22.910 --> 03:24.580
Yeah, more cutbacks.

03:24.590 --> 03:28.830
Unacceptable.It baffles me why
they don't simply let some of you go

03:28.840 --> 03:32.460
so that there's money
available for my research.

03:32.960 --> 03:34.880
You know what baffles me, Sheldon?

03:34.910 --> 03:38.560
Based on your academic record,
any number of things, I imagine.

03:38.570 --> 03:40.300
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Leslie.

03:40.310 --> 03:43.230
Howard, I got the approval for
the rapid prototyper you wanted.

03:43.240 --> 03:45.340
That's great, Leslie. Thanks.

03:45.350 --> 03:48.510
You scratch my back, I scratch yours.

03:51.470 --> 03:53.210
What was all that about?

03:53.240 --> 03:57.950
Oh, uh, no big deal. They gave Leslie
control of some unrestricted grant money.

03:57.960 --> 04:02.620
Yeah, okay, but what's with the back
- scratching and the meow!

04:03.390 --> 04:07.610
I believe the back-scratching metaphor
generally describes a quid p quo situation

04:07.660 --> 04:12.540
where one party provides goods or services to the
second party in compensation for a similar action.

04:12.960 --> 04:13.830
Thank you.

04:13.850 --> 04:18.560
The meow, that sounded to
me like an African civet cat.

04:19.399 --> 04:20.940
Are you done?

04:20.970 --> 04:22.560
No.

04:22.570 --> 04:28.900
Despite what the name suggests,
the civet cat is not a true cat.

04:31.300 --> 04:33.640
Now I'm done.

04:33.900 --> 04:34.990
You know what I'm thinking?

04:35.050 --> 04:37.650
I'm thinking Howard wasn't
making a back-scratching metaphor.

04:37.690 --> 04:41.690
I'm thinking there was some
actual scratching involved.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.710
What about it, Howard?

04:45.750 --> 04:50.360
Okay, I didn't want to say anything 'cause
I know you and Leslie have a little history.

04:50.400 --> 04:51.400
I don't care about that.

04:51.440 --> 04:54.010
Great, 'cause I've been
dying to say something.

04:54.470 --> 04:55.580
You and Leslie?

04:55.620 --> 04:58.660
In the paintball shed! Twice!

04:59.080 --> 05:03.820
Is that why you didn't cover our escape
and let us get cut down like animals?

05:03.850 --> 05:06.540
Oh, yeah, sorry about that.

05:06.860 --> 05:12.870
My good man, dereliction of duty in the
face of the enemy is a court-martial offense.

05:12.910 --> 05:18.600
Court-martial, schmort-martial, Leslie Winkle
is the fifth girl I've ever had sex with.

05:19.230 --> 05:22.080
I mean, for free.

05:22.650 --> 05:24.180
And plus, you got a rapid prototyper.

05:24.210 --> 05:26.220
That's an expensive
piece of equipment, dude.

05:26.260 --> 05:29.540
And the rest of us have had
our budgets cut to the bone.

05:29.580 --> 05:33.210
Okay, one way to look at this is
that I'm getting new equipment,

05:33.260 --> 05:35.140
and you're not, and that's unfair.

05:35.180 --> 05:40.960
But a better way to look at this is that I'm
getting sex and you're not, and that's delightful.

05:44.040 --> 05:46.210
The whole thing froze. I
don't know what happened.

05:46.220 --> 05:47.390
Calm down. We'll figure it out.

05:47.400 --> 05:50.280
How can I calm down? I'm gonna
lose my whole shopping cart.

05:50.290 --> 05:54.030
That's three hours of picking
out shoes just shot to hell.

05:54.790 --> 05:56.400
- Hello, Penny.
- Hello, Sheldon.

05:56.410 --> 05:58.820
You're in my spot.

05:59.440 --> 06:00.890
Are you planning on sitting here?

06:00.920 --> 06:03.060
No, I'm going to the comic book store.

06:03.080 --> 06:04.450
Then what difference does it make?

06:04.480 --> 06:07.540
- What difference does it make?
- Here we go.

06:07.860 --> 06:09.450
That is my spot.

06:09.480 --> 06:12.970
In an ever-changing world, it
is a single point of consistency.

06:12.980 --> 06:18.380
If my life were expressed as a function on a
four-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system,

06:18.430 --> 06:23.950
that spot at the moment I first sat
on it would be zero-zero-zero-zero.

06:27.170 --> 06:29.120
What?

06:29.640 --> 06:32.300
Don't sit in his spot.

06:33.790 --> 06:36.780
Fine. Happy?

06:36.790 --> 06:39.120
I'm not unhappy.

06:42.370 --> 06:46.180
Boy, I love him, but he
is one serious waadoodle.

06:46.890 --> 06:48.160
Okay, that should do it.

06:48.190 --> 06:50.830
Oh, thank you. You are a lifesaver.

06:50.840 --> 06:52.530
That's a lot of shoes you ordered.

06:52.570 --> 06:56.460
Yeah, you know the sad
thing is, it's really not.

06:58.320 --> 07:00.740
Ooh, is thisne of those paintball guns?

07:00.750 --> 07:02.710
Yeah. You ought to come
out with us sometime.

07:02.720 --> 07:04.770
Oh, no, thanks. I'm from Nebraska.

07:04.780 --> 07:09.130
When we shoot things, it's because we want to
eat them or make them leave our boyfriends alone.

07:11.000 --> 07:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:27.390 --> 07:31.230
Boy, your heart's racing. I
must've really gotten you going.

07:31.560 --> 07:36.310
Well, it's partly you, partly
my transient idiopaic arrhythmia.

07:37.550 --> 07:39.940
Sexy.

07:41.210 --> 07:45.060
Can I assume that you likewise
found the experience...

07:45.100 --> 07:47.430
Satisfactory?

07:47.970 --> 07:52.350
That wasn't quite the word I was looking
for, but sure, I'll do this pass-fail.

07:54.130 --> 07:56.430
Hey, are you enjoying
that prototyper I got you?

07:56.460 --> 07:57.780
Oh, it's great.

07:57.820 --> 08:01.610
Everybody in the Engineering
Department is eating their hearts out.

08:01.620 --> 08:05.510
Isn't it nice when your good
fortune makes others miserable?

08:07.170 --> 08:10.840
You know, most people don't get that.

08:11.090 --> 08:14.930
Howard, I'm home!

08:15.490 --> 08:16.380
Oh, great.

08:16.420 --> 08:18.030
Book club was cancelled!

08:18.060 --> 08:22.190
That thing on Phyllis's
neck opened up again!

08:23.420 --> 08:25.200
I'm busy, Ma!

08:25.240 --> 08:28.700
Too busy to help your
mother with her zipper?

08:28.710 --> 08:30.280
Don't come in, Ma!

08:30.320 --> 08:31.700
Why not?

08:31.750 --> 08:34.970
He's got company!

08:39.590 --> 08:41.720
Oh, there's the arrhythmia.

08:41.730 --> 08:45.050
Is she Jewish?

08:45.060 --> 08:46.330
- Are you Jewish?
- No.

08:46.340 --> 08:48.500
Yes!

08:49.290 --> 08:53.130
Okay, then you kids have fun!

08:54.300 --> 08:57.780
Use protection!

09:05.850 --> 09:08.850
You think he'll notice?

09:09.420 --> 09:11.780
There's a chance.

09:11.790 --> 09:13.860
Oh, what are we gonna do?

09:13.890 --> 09:15.810
We?

09:15.820 --> 09:20.960
No, no, you had your chance to be
"we" for, like, a year and a half now.

09:23.050 --> 09:26.790
Right now, you are "you,"
and you are screwed.

09:27.810 --> 09:29.240
Why do we have to tell him I did it?

09:29.270 --> 09:31.240
Well, we're not gonna tell him I did it.

09:31.280 --> 09:33.160
Okay, okay, how about this?

09:33.170 --> 09:37.510
We tell him somebody broke in.

09:39.530 --> 09:42.870
Just to shoot the couch
with a paintball gun?

09:42.880 --> 09:46.190
I'm sorry, Iuy it. All
those people are on drugs.

09:46.800 --> 09:51.060
We could him they wanted the couch
to stay away from their boyfriend.

09:52.740 --> 09:55.170
Okay, fine. What if
we just flip it over?

09:57.510 --> 09:59.480
There. Looks fine, right?

09:59.490 --> 10:03.970
Mm, butt print. There's
no discernible butt print.

10:04.480 --> 10:07.780
Oh, come on.

10:09.530 --> 10:11.510
There, butt print.

10:11.560 --> 10:14.950
It's too small and too... perfect.

10:15.900 --> 10:18.580
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

10:19.290 --> 10:21.050
Act normal.

10:21.060 --> 10:23.360
Sheldon!

10:23.780 --> 10:25.300
How was the comic book store?

10:25.340 --> 10:27.940
Fine. e new issue of Flash is out.

10:27.950 --> 10:31.960
Great, great. Did you walk the
whole way? It's a little chilly.

10:31.970 --> 10:33.500
Koothrappali picked me up.

10:33.530 --> 10:35.530
Isn't that terrific?

10:35.550 --> 10:37.280
He is such a good friend.

10:37.330 --> 10:40.220
You know what the best
thing about friends is?

10:40.250 --> 10:43.810
They don't talk incessantly
for no particular reason.

10:43.830 --> 10:47.160
No, no, friends forgive
the little things.

10:47.190 --> 10:48.590
You know, I gotta go
home and wash my hair.

10:48.610 --> 10:50.860
Don't you dare, missy.

10:52.280 --> 10:55.910
Hello, fastest man alive.

10:55.920 --> 10:59.130
Want to see me read
your entire comic book?

10:59.480 --> 11:02.940
Want to see it again?

11:20.630 --> 11:23.230
Something's wrong.

11:24.110 --> 11:25.120
What do you mean?

11:25.150 --> 11:27.410
I'm not sure.

11:36.550 --> 11:39.460
It doesn't feel right.

11:39.760 --> 11:43.090
I don't know what you're talking about.

11:48.970 --> 11:51.600
Oh, that. Penny did that.

12:11.830 --> 12:13.740
Excuse me.

12:32.340 --> 12:34.630
Why don't you just
eat in your desk chair?

12:34.660 --> 12:37.260
Why don't I just eat in my desk chair?

12:37.280 --> 12:39.430
Here we go.

12:39.440 --> 12:42.250
That is my desk chair.
That is where I work.

12:42.260 --> 12:46.160
I don't eat in my desk chair
and I don't work in my spot.

12:46.210 --> 12:49.660
I work in my desk chair
and eat in my spot.

12:49.700 --> 12:51.730
Wackadoodle.

12:52.020 --> 12:55.800
You know, there's kind of an
obvious solution here. Get up.

13:00.640 --> 13:03.180
There. Problem solved.

13:03.480 --> 13:07.790
Nobody cares where you're
going to sit. You're not crazy.

13:09.800 --> 13:12.610
Excuse me, but the
problem is not solved.

13:12.640 --> 13:17.460
If your head had been accidentally amputated,
and we transplanted a dog's head in its place,

13:17.490 --> 13:19.950
would that be "problem solved"?

13:19.980 --> 13:22.860
If it were your head, it would be.

13:22.870 --> 13:26.130
Sheldon, I am really, really
sorry, but it's only for a week.

13:26.160 --> 13:29.220
Can't you be a little bit flexible?

13:31.510 --> 13:34.460
Yeah, sorry. I didn't
really think that through.

13:34.470 --> 13:37.900
You claimed it's going to be a week,
but I have no faith in your dry cleaner.

13:37.940 --> 13:38.570
Why not?

13:38.600 --> 13:40.740
Did you notice the sign on his counter?

13:40.780 --> 13:43.280
He's not a full-time dry cleaner.

13:43.320 --> 13:45.960
He also makes keys.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.400
Oh, for God's sake, Sheldon.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.180
Focus is important.

13:49.210 --> 13:52.950
Was Michael DeBakey a wedding
planner in between heart transplants?

13:52.980 --> 13:55.490
Did Alexander Fleming
moonlight as a hairdresser?

13:55.520 --> 13:59.750
"Thanks for discovering penicillin.
Now how about we try a bouffant?"

14:03.650 --> 14:06.680
Ooh, looks like I'm
gonna have sex tonight.

14:07.170 --> 14:08.050
Hey, baby...

14:08.080 --> 14:10.910
His right hand is calling him?

14:13.440 --> 14:16.470
No, it's Leslie Winkle.
It's a long story.

14:20.740 --> 14:22.910
I'll pick you up in ten minutes.

14:22.940 --> 14:24.730
Gentlemen, adieu.

14:24.750 --> 14:26.630
I thought we were going
to play Halo tonight.

14:26.670 --> 14:28.400
What am I supposed to do, Leonard?

14:28.420 --> 14:31.520
There's a woman out there
anxious to have sex with me.

14:31.540 --> 14:34.520
You understand, right?

14:37.400 --> 14:39.760
No. Not at all.

14:39.770 --> 14:41.600
Nevertheless, I must depart.

14:41.630 --> 14:42.650
By the way, did I tell you?

14:42.690 --> 14:47.750
Leslie pulled some strings and got me on the research
trip to Geneva to check out the CERN Supercollider.

14:47.760 --> 14:50.280
That's not fair. You're
not even a physicist.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.280
Okay, there are two ways
of looking at this...

14:52.330 --> 14:54.800
- Get out.
- Bye.

14:57.940 --> 14:59.850
You're improving.

15:00.900 --> 15:05.990
Thank you. It helps when I get
to practice with a real woman.

15:07.500 --> 15:10.050
Hey, listen. Saturday my
sister's getting married.

15:10.060 --> 15:12.910
I-I want you to come
with me. It's black tie.

15:13.350 --> 15:17.370
Yeah, gee, I'd really rather not.

15:17.380 --> 15:18.830
Why not?

15:18.870 --> 15:23.060
When I go to weddings, it's
to scam on chunky bridesmaids.

15:23.100 --> 15:26.260
I don't know what I
would do with a date.

15:26.270 --> 15:29.130
Oh, all right. I understand.

15:29.540 --> 15:31.890
Thanks.

15:31.910 --> 15:34.880
Hey, I'm really sorry
about that Geneva trip.

15:35.880 --> 15:36.810
What about it?

15:36.840 --> 15:37.970
Oh, didn't you hear?

15:38.010 --> 15:41.680
I had to reduce the number of people
going, and you didn't make the cut.

15:42.610 --> 15:43.930
When did that haen?

15:43.960 --> 15:46.460
About 12 seconds ago.

15:47.580 --> 15:53.500
Well, hold on. Are you saying if I don't
go to the wedding, I can't go to Geneva?

15:53.510 --> 15:56.360
Actually, I'm trying not to say it.

15:56.400 --> 15:59.870
Okay, I'm sorry, but that
makes me a little uncomfortable.

15:59.890 --> 16:00.620
How so?

16:00.650 --> 16:05.330
Because it's like you're controlling me
with new equipment and research trips.

16:05.360 --> 16:09.550
Well, if I weren't controlling you with new equipment
and research trips, then I'd be uncomfortable.

16:09.560 --> 16:10.510
How so?

16:10.540 --> 16:14.740
'Cause then we'd be in, like, a real
relationship with feelings and all that crap.

16:16.920 --> 16:22.620
So, bottom line, I'm just a
bought-and-paid-for sex toy.

16:26.180 --> 16:30.510
No. No, noat all. You're also arm candy.

16:31.620 --> 16:34.760
So? What do you think?

16:34.770 --> 16:37.930
Hey, Ma, you got to rent me a tux!

16:38.600 --> 16:40.500
Right now?

16:40.520 --> 16:44.270
What kind of sex are
you having up there?

16:52.680 --> 16:54.880
Why are you crouching there?

16:54.920 --> 16:57.710
This is my spot.

16:57.720 --> 17:00.690
Where else am I supposed to crouch?

17:01.480 --> 17:04.280
I don't know. Texas?

17:06.740 --> 17:08.740
Here you go. Fresh from
the cleaners, good as new.

17:08.750 --> 17:11.280
Really? Great. Sheldon,
look. Good as new.

17:11.290 --> 17:14.740
From that key maker, I highly doubt it.

17:15.210 --> 17:18.480
Come on, Sheldon. Just give it a try.

17:19.670 --> 17:22.160
All right.

17:24.030 --> 17:27.930
There, nice and comfy
cozy. Zero, zero, zero.

17:28.230 --> 17:31.110
There's one more zero.

17:31.140 --> 17:33.790
You forgot the time parameter.

17:33.810 --> 17:36.890
Sit on the damn couch.

17:58.970 --> 18:00.870
Nope.

18:02.280 --> 18:04.430
What do you mean, "nope"?
What's wrong with it?

18:04.440 --> 18:07.460
Nothing, it's what's wrong with him.

18:07.470 --> 18:10.630
- It's exactly the same...
- Penny, Penny,

18:10.640 --> 18:12.940
I think I know what to do.

18:13.200 --> 18:15.340
Sheldon, I have some bad news.

18:15.370 --> 18:17.480
More?

18:17.490 --> 18:18.830
I'm afraid so.

18:18.870 --> 18:21.350
You know the cashew chicken
I get you Monday nights?

18:21.380 --> 18:24.050
Yes. From Szechuan Palace.

18:24.350 --> 18:28.000
Szechuan Palace closed two years ago.

18:29.560 --> 18:33.760
What? Whe did my cashew
chicken come from?

18:33.770 --> 18:36.680
Golden Dragon.

18:40.340 --> 18:42.660
No.

18:44.260 --> 18:46.320
No, this isn't right.

18:46.340 --> 18:49.480
Our food always comes in
Szechuan Palace containers.

18:49.530 --> 18:55.150
Yeah, well, before they went out of
business, I bought 4,000 containers.

18:55.670 --> 18:58.660
I keep them in the trunk of my car.

18:59.300 --> 19:04.380
But... Oh, this changes everything.

19:05.830 --> 19:08.800
I thought that might take
his mind off the cushion.

19:08.810 --> 19:12.680
What's real? What isn't? How can I know?

19:13.570 --> 19:14.940
You did make that up, right?

19:14.970 --> 19:17.750
Oh, God, I wish I had.

19:19.120 --> 19:20.510
- Leonard?
- Yeah, buddy?

19:20.520 --> 19:23.460
I still don't like this cushion.

19:25.640 --> 19:28.200
ll, Penny, thank you for coming.

19:28.230 --> 19:30.820
Thanks for the shoes.

19:30.830 --> 19:34.180
Penny is an amazing shot. I think we
have a real chance to win this week.

19:34.190 --> 19:36.970
- What's the plan?
- Okay. Now, we all run out.

19:36.980 --> 19:39.610
Sheldon and I will cut to
the left behind these trees.

19:39.640 --> 19:42.380
Raj, Howard and Leslie flank
to the right behind the rocks.

19:42.430 --> 19:46.950
Then we'll all have a great view as Penny
runs out and kills everyone else in sight.

19:47.740 --> 19:49.430
Just one thing before we start.

19:49.480 --> 19:51.650
What is it, Sheldon?

19:54.130 --> 19:55.780
What the hell?

19:55.820 --> 19:58.660
That was for my cushion.

19:58.670 --> 20:00.840
Sheldon, Penny was our only hope.

20:00.880 --> 20:06.690
I'm sorry, Leonard. But revenge
is a dish best served cold.

20:07.670 --> 20:10.310
Screw that.

20:11.750 --> 20:14.250
She can't shoot me. She's dead.

20:14.260 --> 20:16.690
He's right. You can't.

20:21.910 --> 20:25.560
Well, if we're going to
descend into anarchy...

20:30.140 --> 20:33.170
Okay, see you.

20:33.830 --> 20:35.420
Where are you going?

20:35.460 --> 20:37.950
Surrender, then Denny's.
