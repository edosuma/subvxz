According to officials,

00:15.208 --> 00:16.166
Mister Meowzer--

00:16.208 --> 00:17.291
Just a second, Mary.

We have some

00:17.333 --> 00:18.750
breaking news.

00:19.500 --> 00:20.709
It seems Captain Man

00:20.750 --> 00:22.458
and Kid Danger have

00:20.750 --> 00:22.458
captured

00:22.500 --> 00:23.834
the Time Jerker.

00:24.083 --> 00:25.875
Now let's go to

00:24.083 --> 00:25.875
Evelyn Hall

00:25.917 --> 00:28.000
live at the Swellview

00:25.917 --> 00:28.000

Thank you, Trent.

00:29.667 --> 00:30.709
Captain Man and Kid Danger,

00:30.750 --> 00:32.417
can you tell us

00:30.750 --> 00:32.417
what happened here?

00:32.458 --> 00:34.625
Well, we found out

00:32.458 --> 00:34.625
that the Time Jerker was--

00:34.667 --> 00:35.458
Hello, Evelyn.

00:36.375 --> 00:37.458
Hey.

00:38.125 --> 00:40.875
So, about an hour ago,

00:38.125 --> 00:40.875
I swung in here,

00:40.917 --> 00:42.125
crashed through

00:40.917 --> 00:42.125
that glass,

00:42.166 --> 00:43.000
and captured that

00:42.166 --> 00:43.000
Time Jerker

00:43.041 --> 00:44.417
you see right

00:43.041 --> 00:44.417
over there.

00:44.458 --> 00:45.792
I also participated.

00:45.834 --> 00:47.750
Well, Captain Man,

00:45.834 --> 00:47.750
once again,

00:47.792 --> 00:51.166
the city of Swellview

00:47.792 --> 00:51.166
owes you a big fat thank you.

00:51.750 --> 00:53.250
I also participated.

00:53.959 --> 00:56.291
Ah, I don't fight crime

00:53.959 --> 00:56.291
for thank yous.

00:56.709 --> 00:58.417
But there is something

00:56.709 --> 00:58.417
that I want.

00:58.458 --> 00:59.375
Sure.

00:59.917 --> 01:00.917
Anything.

01:01.875 --> 01:03.291
Uh, I mean, what?

01:04.166 --> 01:05.417
As I'm sure

01:04.166 --> 01:05.417
you already know,

01:05.458 --> 01:06.875
there's a very special

01:05.458 --> 01:06.875
steak house

01:06.917 --> 01:08.875
here in Swellview

01:06.917 --> 01:08.875
called Montego's.

01:08.917 --> 01:10.333
Right.

01:08.917 --> 01:10.333
I've heard of Montego's.

01:10.375 --> 01:11.583
Yeah, well, did you know

01:10.375 --> 01:11.583
you can't

01:11.625 --> 01:12.917
get a reservation

01:11.625 --> 01:12.917
at that place?

01:12.959 --> 01:14.750
You have to be invited

01:12.959 --> 01:14.750
by the owner?

01:14.792 --> 01:17.250
Anyway, we're really glad

01:14.792 --> 01:17.250
that we were able to capture

01:17.291 --> 01:18.250
the Time Jerker

01:17.291 --> 01:18.250
because--

01:18.291 --> 01:20.000
Hey, hey.

01:18.291 --> 01:20.000

01:24.667 --> 01:26.458

Okay, next criminal.

01:58.709 --> 02:00.583
They call him "Malkoff."

02:01.166 --> 02:04.333
He steals dogs, then shaves them

02:01.166 --> 02:04.333
and sells their hair

02:04.375 --> 02:05.542
to wig shops.

02:05.583 --> 02:07.417
Ugh. Sick weirdo.

Any messages come in for me

02:12.125 --> 02:14.542

02:15.417 --> 02:18.000
No, Ray, that restaurant

02:15.417 --> 02:18.000
still hasn't called you.

02:18.542 --> 02:19.583
Ding dang it.

02:26.667 --> 02:28.125

02:40.208 --> 02:41.917
There you go.

02:40.208 --> 02:41.917
Don't you feel better?

02:43.959 --> 02:45.208
I just don't get it.

02:45.917 --> 02:47.959
I said it on the news

02:45.917 --> 02:47.959
two weeks ago.

02:48.250 --> 02:49.667
I said, "Feel free

02:48.250 --> 02:49.667

03:11.166 --> 03:12.667

irresponsible scientist.

03:39.291 --> 03:41.000
I wanted an

after-school job.

03:41.041 --> 03:42.041

Ah!

03:45.375 --> 03:46.959
[Henry]

03:45.375 --> 03:46.959
I went into this

03:45.375 --> 03:46.959
crazy store

03:47.458 --> 03:49.291
and met a pretty

03:47.458 --> 03:49.291
interesting guy.

03:49.333 --> 03:50.875
- I'm going to blow your mind.

Now I protect the good

- Captain Man!

03:57.709 --> 03:58.709
- That's right, Henry.

03:59.166 --> 04:01.583
In time, I realized that

03:59.166 --> 04:01.583
being a superhero

04:01.625 --> 04:03.291
is a lot to handle alone.

04:03.333 --> 04:04.583

- It is done.

Henry, three weeks ago,

04:54.500 --> 04:57.375
I was injured,

04:57.417 --> 04:59.458
lying on the gym floor,

04:59.500 --> 05:00.792
but you found me,

05:00.834 --> 05:03.834
and you pulled that

05:00.834 --> 05:03.834
long, rusty, bloody nail

06:58.458 --> 06:59.875
Yeah.

06:59.917 --> 07:01.542
Even some of our neighbors

06:59.917 --> 07:01.542
heard about it.

07:01.583 --> 07:02.959
Hey, neighbors.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.125
[all]

07:03.000 --> 07:04.125
Hey, Henry.

07:06.125 --> 07:07.291
And you are?

07:07.667 --> 07:08.875
Oh, my name's Herb.

07:08.917 --> 07:11.041
I'm visiting from Los Angeles.

07:11.083 --> 07:12.875
Thinking about buying

07:11.083 --> 07:12.875
a vacation home

07:12.917 --> 07:14.250
here in Swellview.

07:17.500 --> 07:18.667
My life's going great.

07:20.375 --> 07:21.667
And you're here why?

07:22.125 --> 07:24.542
I just saw people

07:22.125 --> 07:24.542
walking into this house.

07:24.583 --> 07:25.709
Joined them.

07:26.375 --> 07:27.417
So, Henry,

07:28.208 --> 07:31.375
we heard that part of your

07:28.208 --> 07:31.375
Student of the Month prize

07:31.417 --> 07:34.709
is dinner for two

07:31.417 --> 07:34.709
at Montego's?

07:34.750 --> 07:36.000
Oh, really?

07:36.041 --> 07:36.709
[all talking at once]

07:36.750 --> 07:38.458
I had no idea.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.000
Oh, please take me.

07:40.542 --> 07:41.667
Why would he take you?

07:41.709 --> 07:42.667
I'm his best friend.

07:42.709 --> 07:44.000
You are not.

07:44.041 --> 07:45.625
Hey, a boy's best friend

07:44.041 --> 07:45.625
is his mother.

07:45.667 --> 07:47.542
Oh, that's a crock of bull.

07:47.583 --> 07:49.166
[all talking at once]

07:50.750 --> 07:51.917
[Henry]

07:50.750 --> 07:51.917
Calm down. Calm down.

07:51.959 --> 07:53.625
Mrs. Hendricks,

07:51.959 --> 07:53.625
put the lamp down.

07:53.667 --> 07:54.458
Put it down.

07:54.500 --> 07:57.208
Hey, hey! Henry! Hi!

07:57.458 --> 07:59.166
I just heard about your,

07:59.208 --> 08:01.250
you know, your,

07:59.208 --> 08:01.250
your prize.

08:01.291 --> 08:02.208
Oh god.

08:02.250 --> 08:03.625
[panting]

08:03.667 --> 08:04.750
Aah.

08:05.333 --> 08:06.500
Why are you wet?

08:06.542 --> 08:07.834
Aah. I'm sweating.

08:08.083 --> 08:10.000
I just ran nine miles

08:08.083 --> 08:10.000
to get here.

08:12.041 --> 08:13.041
What's the dog leash for?

08:13.083 --> 08:14.750
I was walking a friend's dog.

08:15.458 --> 08:16.709
Where's the dog?

08:17.625 --> 08:18.542
I don't know.

08:23.625 --> 08:25.709
Hey, who is this guy?

08:25.750 --> 08:26.959
[all talking at once]

08:27.000 --> 08:28.208
Hey, hey, hey!

08:28.583 --> 08:30.000
For those of you

08:28.583 --> 08:30.000
who don't know,

08:30.041 --> 08:32.500
this is Ray, my boss

08:30.041 --> 08:32.500
at Junk-N-Stuff,

08:33.166 --> 08:35.750
and he's been dying to go to

08:33.166 --> 08:35.750
Montego's for years.

08:35.792 --> 08:36.583
So...

08:39.375 --> 08:40.792
I'm taking Ray

08:39.375 --> 08:40.792
to Montego's.

08:41.041 --> 08:42.208
[wailing]

08:42.250 --> 08:44.542
[Ray laughs]

08:44.583 --> 08:46.291
Yeah, all right,

08:44.583 --> 08:46.291
yeah, baby.

08:46.333 --> 08:48.166
Who's got

08:46.333 --> 08:48.166
the lamp now, huh?

09:05.709 --> 09:07.333
Happy Lockerversary.

09:08.500 --> 09:09.667
I'm sorry, happy what?

09:10.542 --> 09:11.709
Lockerversary.

09:12.375 --> 09:13.208
I...

09:13.250 --> 09:14.667
I am so lost.

09:15.333 --> 09:17.583
It was six months ago today

09:15.333 --> 09:17.583
when you and I first

09:17.625 --> 09:18.959
started sharing this locker.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.583
Oh, okay.

09:20.625 --> 09:21.959
Wait, wait, wait.

09:22.959 --> 09:23.875
For you.

09:25.709 --> 09:26.792
Aw.

09:27.125 --> 09:29.208
It's an exact replica

09:27.125 --> 09:29.208
of our locker.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.083
I know.

09:31.125 --> 09:32.041
How'd you get this?

09:32.834 --> 09:34.542
I found a guy who makes

09:32.834 --> 09:34.542
small replicas of lockers.

09:34.583 --> 09:35.542
Well, that explains it.

09:41.250 --> 09:42.750
I should've expected that.

09:43.959 --> 09:45.291
Got you in the face.

09:45.333 --> 09:46.333
Yeah.

09:47.291 --> 09:48.667
But I feel bad because

09:49.291 --> 09:50.542
I didn't get

09:49.291 --> 09:50.542
anything for you.

09:50.583 --> 09:51.959
Aw, you didn't have to.

09:52.000 --> 09:52.792
Well, awesome.

09:53.917 --> 09:55.750
I mean, what's better than

09:53.917 --> 09:55.750
the two of us having dinner

09:55.792 --> 09:57.458
together at Montego's?

10:01.750 --> 10:02.625
Wait, what'd you say?

10:03.458 --> 10:04.792
You're taking me, right?

10:06.250 --> 10:07.458
Well, yeah.

10:07.500 --> 10:09.000
Duh, I mean,

10:07.500 --> 10:09.000
what kind of person

10:09.041 --> 10:11.208
wins dinner for two and doesn't

10:09.041 --> 10:11.208
invite his girlfriend?

10:11.250 --> 10:12.250
A terrible person.

10:12.291 --> 10:13.834
Right. Not me.

10:12.291 --> 10:13.834
Not me.

10:19.083 --> 10:19.959
Aah!

10:20.000 --> 10:20.750
[thud]

10:21.125 --> 10:22.125
[elevator dings]

10:25.250 --> 10:26.417
Hey, Ray--

10:27.333 --> 10:28.250
Ha-ha!

10:28.291 --> 10:29.083
Hi.

10:29.375 --> 10:30.250
Hey, Henry.

10:30.291 --> 10:31.291
You want to join me?

10:31.542 --> 10:32.458
For what?

10:32.834 --> 10:33.709
Rehearsal.

10:34.083 --> 10:35.458
I'm practicing what

10:34.083 --> 10:35.458
I'm going to order

10:35.500 --> 10:36.667
when we get to Montego's.

10:38.917 --> 10:41.375
Okay, Ray, I got to

10:38.917 --> 10:41.375
talk to you about--

10:41.417 --> 10:42.291
Watch, watch, watch.

10:42.333 --> 10:43.333
[clears throat]

10:44.000 --> 10:45.375
Yes, and for my steak

10:44.000 --> 10:45.375
I'll have the

10:45.417 --> 10:46.875
16 ounce rib-eye,

10:46.917 --> 10:49.500
and I want that cooked

10:46.917 --> 10:49.500
medium rare.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.709
Of course.

10:51.750 --> 10:52.959
And would you care

10:51.750 --> 10:52.959
for anything else?

10:53.000 --> 10:55.125
Yes. I'll also have

10:53.000 --> 10:55.125
two more steaks.

10:55.166 --> 10:56.542
[laughs]

10:56.583 --> 10:57.792
Oh, Henry,

10:58.417 --> 11:00.166
you don't know

10:58.417 --> 11:00.166
what this means to me.

11:00.208 --> 11:02.083
It's just beef, man.

11:03.500 --> 11:04.583
Look,

11:04.917 --> 11:06.041
I didn't

11:04.917 --> 11:06.041
tell you this, but

11:06.291 --> 11:08.125
I've been going through

11:06.291 --> 11:08.125
a rough patch lately.

11:08.166 --> 11:09.291
Oh, geez.

11:09.625 --> 11:10.750
I've just been feeling

11:09.625 --> 11:10.750
so depressed

11:10.792 --> 11:12.250
the last couple

11:10.792 --> 11:12.250
of months

11:12.291 --> 11:13.917
until you invited me

11:12.291 --> 11:13.917
to go with you to Montego's

11:13.959 --> 11:14.667
for dinner.

11:14.709 --> 11:16.166
Well, yeah,

11:14.709 --> 11:16.166
but I mean--

11:16.208 --> 11:18.709
Hey, is it okay if I tell you

11:16.208 --> 11:18.709
that I think of you as family?

11:18.750 --> 11:20.834
I mean, you're like the little

11:18.750 --> 11:20.834
brother or the nephew

11:20.875 --> 11:22.333
I never had.

11:22.375 --> 11:23.625
Ray, I can't take you

11:22.375 --> 11:23.625
to Montego's.

11:25.208 --> 11:26.125
What'd you say?

11:27.291 --> 11:28.750
I got to take Bianca.

11:28.792 --> 11:29.625
I'm sorry.

11:31.250 --> 11:33.750
Ahhh, you're joking.

11:34.458 --> 11:35.583
No...

11:35.625 --> 11:36.667
Yeah, you're making a joke.

11:36.709 --> 11:38.125
You're joke making.

11:38.166 --> 11:39.291
No.

11:39.333 --> 11:40.792
Yeah, you're making a joke.

11:42.959 --> 11:44.083
I'm not joking.

11:44.125 --> 11:45.250
Yes, you are, too.

11:45.291 --> 11:47.041
This is a terrible,

11:45.291 --> 11:47.041
awful, mean joke

11:47.083 --> 11:48.625
but it's all going

11:47.083 --> 11:48.625
to be okay 'cause

11:48.667 --> 11:51.125
you are still taking me to

11:48.667 --> 11:51.125
Montego's with you, right?

11:51.166 --> 11:52.333
Ray...

11:52.375 --> 11:53.667
I said you are still

11:52.375 --> 11:53.667
taking me to Montego's

11:53.709 --> 11:54.667
with you, right?

11:54.709 --> 11:55.458
Bianca's my girlfriend.

11:55.500 --> 11:56.208
I got to take her.

11:56.250 --> 11:57.709
Wh-- why?

11:57.750 --> 11:59.417
Because I do.

11:57.750 --> 11:59.417
I'm really sorry.

12:02.375 --> 12:03.208
Okay.

12:05.291 --> 12:06.583
Dude, look,

12:06.625 --> 12:08.083
maybe later

12:06.625 --> 12:08.083
you and I can just--

12:08.125 --> 12:09.083
You know,

12:08.125 --> 12:09.083
don't worry about me.

12:09.125 --> 12:09.875
I'm fine.

12:10.959 --> 12:11.667
Are you sure?

12:11.709 --> 12:12.750
Yeah, I'm fine.

12:14.750 --> 12:15.917
Aah!

12:22.917 --> 12:24.291
Aah!

12:26.125 --> 12:26.917
Ray?

12:28.166 --> 12:29.542
I'm fine.

12:40.667 --> 12:42.041
[chatter]

12:50.083 --> 12:52.083
Hey, guys.

12:52.542 --> 12:53.208
Hi, Henry.

12:53.250 --> 12:54.125
Hey.

12:55.083 --> 12:56.375
Jasper, Charlotte,

12:55.083 --> 12:56.375
what are you guys doing here?

12:56.417 --> 12:57.625
No big reason.

12:57.667 --> 12:59.333
Just came to hang.

12:59.667 --> 13:02.417
Oh, well, I can't hang

12:59.667 --> 13:02.417
because tonight's the night

13:02.458 --> 13:04.000
I'm taking Bianca

13:02.458 --> 13:04.000
to Montego's.

13:04.041 --> 13:05.041
[all]

13:04.041 --> 13:05.041
Oh.

13:05.083 --> 13:07.834
[all talking at once]

13:07.875 --> 13:10.041
Come on, I know

13:07.875 --> 13:10.041
you guys knew that.

13:10.083 --> 13:11.709
And why are you

13:10.083 --> 13:11.709
all dressed up?

13:11.750 --> 13:14.291
Well, we thought,

13:11.750 --> 13:14.291
you know...

13:14.333 --> 13:16.875
If something bad happens

13:14.333 --> 13:16.875
to Bianca...

13:16.917 --> 13:18.542
Like, if she got her head

13:16.917 --> 13:18.542
stuck in a fence.

13:20.125 --> 13:22.166
Or if she got hit

13:20.125 --> 13:22.166
by a bus.

13:22.542 --> 13:23.834
Or even if she just...

13:23.875 --> 13:24.709
disappeared.

13:25.166 --> 13:26.000
Yeah.

13:27.000 --> 13:27.834
Okay, this is sick.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.041
You people are sick.

13:29.583 --> 13:30.542
We're just saying,

13:30.583 --> 13:32.291
you might need someone

13:30.583 --> 13:32.291
to fill in

13:32.333 --> 13:33.667
and have dinner with you.

13:33.709 --> 13:34.375
Right.

13:34.417 --> 13:35.959
For example, me.

13:37.458 --> 13:39.333
We just don't want you

13:37.458 --> 13:39.333
to be alone.

13:39.750 --> 13:40.917
We love you, Hen.

13:41.625 --> 13:42.625
I'm your dad.

13:42.667 --> 13:43.542
I gave birth to you.

13:43.583 --> 13:44.709
I watched.

13:43.583 --> 13:44.709
Oh, big deal.

13:45.291 --> 13:47.000
I'm leaving now.

13:47.041 --> 13:47.792
Oh, wait!

13:47.834 --> 13:48.875
Wait, no, wait!

13:52.083 --> 13:54.166
I'm taking Bianca.

[all]

13:54.208 --> 13:56.125
No!

13:59.917 --> 14:01.917
My life's still going great.

14:08.709 --> 14:10.333
Matthew will show you

14:08.709 --> 14:10.333
to your table.

14:18.375 --> 14:19.917
Your names, please.

14:20.333 --> 14:21.917
Yes, I'm Henry.

14:21.959 --> 14:23.000
Henry Hart.

14:23.375 --> 14:25.667
And this is my girlfriend,

It's our Lockerversary.

14:39.917 --> 14:41.834
from Junk-N-Stuff?

14:41.875 --> 14:42.583
Yes.

14:42.625 --> 14:43.542
No, I'm not.

14:43.583 --> 14:44.625
I'm in ninth grade, dude.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.291
Pardon me, where's

14:46.000 --> 14:48.291
the ladies' room?

14:48.333 --> 14:50.625
I know you're not a girl.

14:50.667 --> 14:51.667
Prove it.

14:51.959 --> 14:53.000
Gross.

14:53.041 --> 14:56.959
[all talking at once]

14:58.250 --> 14:59.417
[whistle blows]

15:01.667 --> 15:03.792
Why are they here

15:01.667 --> 15:03.792
pretending to be us?

15:03.834 --> 15:06.041
Why are you here

15:03.834 --> 15:06.041
pretending to be us?

15:06.083 --> 15:06.917
Yeah, son.

15:06.959 --> 15:07.583
Stop it.

15:09.542 --> 15:10.458
Look...

15:11.500 --> 15:12.709
they did this 'cause

15:12.750 --> 15:14.291
Ray's been, like,

15:12.750 --> 15:14.291
dying to come

15:14.333 --> 15:15.750
to this restaurant for years.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.417
Well, now I feel all bad.

15:19.458 --> 15:20.583
No, you shouldn't.

15:20.625 --> 15:22.000
But I'm not even

15:20.625 --> 15:22.000
that into steak.

15:22.041 --> 15:23.041
What?

15:24.166 --> 15:25.250
Yeah,

15:25.792 --> 15:26.875
I was going to

15:25.792 --> 15:26.875
order the chicken.

15:26.917 --> 15:28.333
Oh, no!

15:28.375 --> 15:29.667
No, no, no, no.

15:30.542 --> 15:31.542
Ray, you're embarrassing me.

15:31.583 --> 15:32.417
Oh, I'm embarrassing you?

15:32.458 --> 15:33.625
Yes.

15:33.667 --> 15:35.166
Or is it your chicken-loving

15:33.667 --> 15:35.166
girlfriend there?

15:35.208 --> 15:36.250
It's you.

15:37.959 --> 15:38.750
Pfff.

15:38.792 --> 15:39.750
Boys.

15:40.291 --> 15:41.166
You're a boy.

15:41.208 --> 15:42.041
Prove it.

15:42.959 --> 15:44.875
Ray, please go home.

15:44.917 --> 15:45.750
Bianca and I--

15:45.792 --> 15:46.625
No...

15:46.667 --> 15:48.291
It's, it's okay.

15:48.333 --> 15:50.291
Seriously, I don't care

15:48.333 --> 15:50.291
that much about eating here

15:50.333 --> 15:53.542
and your boss really does,

15:50.333 --> 15:53.542
so, just have dinner with him.

15:54.291 --> 15:55.709
You're sure?

15:55.750 --> 15:56.875
Sure she's sure.

15:55.750 --> 15:56.875
Look at her.

15:56.917 --> 15:58.458
That's what sure people

15:56.917 --> 15:58.458
look like.

15:58.500 --> 15:59.542
Yeah, I'm sure.

16:00.208 --> 16:00.875
Aah.

16:02.709 --> 16:03.458
All right, man.

16:04.166 --> 16:05.250
Looks like we're having

16:04.166 --> 16:05.250
dinner here together.

16:05.291 --> 16:06.542
And me too?

16:06.959 --> 16:08.083
No.

16:08.125 --> 16:09.959
The reservation is

16:08.125 --> 16:09.959
only for two.

16:10.000 --> 16:10.667
Oh.

16:11.250 --> 16:12.291
Okay.

16:13.125 --> 16:13.792
No problem.

16:14.875 --> 16:15.709
Balloons.

16:19.291 --> 16:24.083
[chuckling]

16:28.500 --> 16:30.208
Oh, you feel that?

16:30.250 --> 16:32.125
You feel that warm bread?

16:32.166 --> 16:33.709
This is how bread

16:32.166 --> 16:33.709
should feel.

16:33.750 --> 16:34.500
Right?

16:35.750 --> 16:36.583
Okay, ready?

16:36.625 --> 16:37.291
Yeah.

16:39.291 --> 16:41.500
[both]

16:39.291 --> 16:41.500
Ohh.

16:41.542 --> 16:42.083
Mm.

16:42.125 --> 16:43.083
Oh my god.

16:43.125 --> 16:44.000
Hey,

16:44.417 --> 16:45.458
after we finish

16:44.417 --> 16:45.458
our steaks,

16:45.500 --> 16:47.000
what do you want

16:45.500 --> 16:47.000
to get for dessert?

16:47.041 --> 16:48.500
I think we should

16:47.041 --> 16:48.500
get more steak.

16:48.542 --> 16:50.291
We're getting steak

16:48.542 --> 16:50.291
for dessert?

16:50.333 --> 16:51.125
What would you

16:50.333 --> 16:51.125
rather have,

16:51.166 --> 16:52.417
the chicken?

16:52.458 --> 16:53.583
Don't make fun of Bianca.

16:53.625 --> 16:55.291
She gave up

16:53.625 --> 16:55.291
her dinner for you.

16:55.333 --> 16:56.834
I know.

16:55.333 --> 16:56.834
So stupid.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.542
Dude, I don't get

16:57.750 --> 16:59.542
how can you can just--

16:59.583 --> 17:00.417
Shh.

17:01.250 --> 17:02.333
What?

17:02.875 --> 17:04.458
Okay, you remember

17:02.875 --> 17:04.458
two weeks ago?

17:04.500 --> 17:06.542
The robbery at

17:04.500 --> 17:06.542
that jewelry store?

17:06.583 --> 17:08.542
You mean those two robbers

17:06.583 --> 17:08.542
who stole the jewelry?

17:09.917 --> 17:10.625
Yeah.

17:11.041 --> 17:12.208
Their names are...

17:12.542 --> 17:14.375
Ert Landers and

17:12.542 --> 17:14.375
Bernie Caldwell.

17:14.417 --> 17:15.333
That's them

17:14.417 --> 17:15.333
right over there.

17:15.375 --> 17:16.458
For real?

17:26.083 --> 17:27.041
That is Ert and Bernie.

17:27.083 --> 17:27.792
I know.

17:28.083 --> 17:29.208
Punks.

17:30.041 --> 17:30.625
Hey.

17:31.208 --> 17:32.333
They're about to leave.

17:33.250 --> 17:34.166
That's our cue.

17:36.333 --> 17:37.333
Pop a gumball.

17:37.375 --> 17:38.583
But I haven't had

17:37.375 --> 17:38.583
my steak yet.

17:38.625 --> 17:39.208
They're criminals.

17:39.250 --> 17:40.333
I want my steak.

17:40.375 --> 17:41.917
Ray, put a gumball

17:40.375 --> 17:41.917
in your mouth right now.

17:41.959 --> 17:42.792
Aah!

17:46.083 --> 17:46.792
Let's do this.

17:53.875 --> 17:55.166
You know what?

17:53.875 --> 17:55.166
I'm just gonna--

18:09.208 --> 18:10.083
Hey, Ert.

18:10.125 --> 18:11.250
And Bernie.

18:12.041 --> 18:13.667
Aw, man.

18:13.709 --> 18:15.959
That's "Aw, Captain Man."

18:16.875 --> 18:18.250
Now...

18:16.875 --> 18:18.250
[cracks knuckles]

18:18.291 --> 18:20.291
can you count

18:18.291 --> 18:20.291
from one to bam?

18:20.333 --> 18:22.166
I'll try. One...

18:22.208 --> 18:22.834
Bam!

18:28.917 --> 18:30.583
[grunting]

19:03.709 --> 19:04.917
Care for some

19:03.709 --> 19:04.917
fresh pepper?

19:04.959 --> 19:05.709
Huh?

19:06.250 --> 19:07.166
Say when.

19:07.208 --> 19:08.500
When! When!

19:13.333 --> 19:14.000
Aah!

19:15.834 --> 19:16.625
Watch out.

19:18.000 --> 19:18.834
Drop it.

19:27.959 --> 19:29.750
[grunting]

19:35.458 --> 19:37.375
I'd say that was

19:35.458 --> 19:37.375
a job...

19:38.166 --> 19:38.750
well done.

19:40.542 --> 19:42.000
Take them away, boys.

19:44.291 --> 19:45.250
And now...

19:46.000 --> 19:46.834
some cow.

19:53.875 --> 19:54.667
Excuse me,

19:54.959 --> 19:56.083
Captain Man and

19:54.959 --> 19:56.083
Kid Danger?

19:56.125 --> 19:56.834
Uh-huh.

19:56.875 --> 19:57.875
What's up, big dog?

19:59.000 --> 20:01.959
I'm sorry, but your names

19:59.000 --> 20:01.959
aren't on our dinner list.

20:04.250 --> 20:06.583
And you can't eat here

20:04.250 --> 20:06.583
without an invitation.

20:06.750 --> 20:07.375
What--

20:07.417 --> 20:08.250
No, no, no--

20:08.291 --> 20:09.458
You got to

20:08.291 --> 20:09.458
be kidding me.

20:09.500 --> 20:10.125
[both talking at once]

20:10.166 --> 20:11.333
No, no, no, wait.

20:11.375 --> 20:12.250
You got to be kidding me.

20:12.291 --> 20:13.250
What? No.

20:13.291 --> 20:14.125
Come on, man.

20:14.166 --> 20:15.291
What? Why?

20:15.333 --> 20:16.583
[both]

20:15.333 --> 20:16.583
Aah!

20:25.875 --> 20:26.625
Hi.

20:26.667 --> 20:28.125
How were your steaks?

20:28.166 --> 20:29.834
You better shut your mouth,

20:28.166 --> 20:29.834
Schwoz, I mean it,

20:29.875 --> 20:31.041
you better shut

20:29.875 --> 20:31.041
your dirty mouth.

20:33.375 --> 20:34.583
Geez.

20:35.333 --> 20:36.417
Hey,

20:36.458 --> 20:37.834
why are you still

20:36.458 --> 20:37.834
wearing that dress?

20:37.875 --> 20:39.375
Because it's so

20:37.875 --> 20:39.375
comfortable.

20:39.417 --> 20:42.917
And I like how the cool air

20:39.417 --> 20:42.917
blows up in here.

20:45.667 --> 20:47.375
Hey, you want to go

20:45.667 --> 20:47.375
to Back Out Steak House?

20:47.417 --> 20:48.917
No, I want steak

20:47.417 --> 20:48.917
from Montego's.

20:48.959 --> 20:50.166
Well, we can't get

20:48.959 --> 20:50.166
steak from--

20:50.208 --> 20:50.959
Wait.

20:52.041 --> 20:52.834
What is...

20:53.417 --> 20:54.041
What is that...

20:55.333 --> 20:56.333
Is it...

20:57.458 --> 20:58.834
do you know what this is?

20:59.875 --> 21:00.667
Steak.

21:00.709 --> 21:02.083
From Montego's!

21:03.333 --> 21:04.709
Whoa.

21:04.750 --> 21:06.291
It must've fallen down here

21:04.750 --> 21:06.291
when we were fighting

21:06.333 --> 21:07.125
Ert and Bernie.

21:07.166 --> 21:07.959
I know.

21:09.000 --> 21:09.792
[sniffs]

21:10.542 --> 21:11.792
Aw, yeah.

21:14.166 --> 21:15.000
Can I have it?

21:17.125 --> 21:17.750
Can we split it?

21:47.291 --> 21:48.542
[moaning]

21:54.834 --> 21:56.291
Want to go to

21:54.834 --> 21:56.291
Back Out Steak House?

21:56.333 --> 21:57.208
Yeah, I guess.

22:29.333 --> 22:30.250
[oven bell]

22:30.291 --> 22:31.000
Mmm...
