01:20.831 --> 01:22.875
Hi. Good morning, Danny.
How'd you sleep?

01:24.543 --> 01:26.879
I don't know. Not good. Maybe.

01:27.713 --> 01:28.714
How come?

01:31.175 --> 01:32.718
You ever tried sleeping in a prison?

01:37.014 --> 01:38.098
Did you see the eclipse?

01:38.682 --> 01:40.726
No, just the light.
It was pretty weird though.

01:41.393 --> 01:45.230
Carl Jung thought
eclipses were harbingers of rebirth.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.440
Who?

01:46.440 --> 01:49.026
A psychiatrist. Never heard of him?
He's pretty famous.

01:49.776 --> 01:50.777
No.

01:53.030 --> 01:54.239
You okay?

01:55.115 --> 01:58.827
- You seem a little nervous.
- Yeah. Maybe.

02:00.537 --> 02:03.040
Maybe I am a little, today.

02:03.040 --> 02:06.960
Is that why you're clumsy?
Because you're not typically.

02:08.586 --> 02:10.297
That's very perceptive of you.

02:12.549 --> 02:14.134
Why are you nervous?

02:15.427 --> 02:16.637
I'm gonna ask you a question.

02:18.597 --> 02:20.057
Why are you here?

02:22.017 --> 02:23.018
What do you mean?

02:23.018 --> 02:24.186
Here with me.

02:26.313 --> 02:28.941
Because of what happened
at Rockefeller Center.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.401
But why are we talking about it?

02:31.985 --> 02:34.071
You're helping me get ready for my trial.

02:34.613 --> 02:40.160
Because even if I didn't fire the gun,
I'm complicit if a crime was committed.

02:43.038 --> 02:46.583
Well, last week we talked about
Jack and you going to London.

02:47.918 --> 02:49.837
Did you know that Jack came to see me?

02:53.006 --> 02:55.133
No, that's not possible. He's in London.

02:56.093 --> 02:57.094
Are these Jack's?

03:09.231 --> 03:10.315
It's in my guidebook.

03:11.817 --> 03:14.111
You got his number from the guidebook.
Is that how you found him?

03:14.611 --> 03:15.737
No, but I tore it up.

03:16.238 --> 03:19.032
Wait, did the police put it back together?
How did you get these?

03:19.032 --> 03:24.538
Danny. Your mind is extraordinarily good
at rationalizing.

03:24.538 --> 03:27.040
At unspooling narratives in real time.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.670
At making the improbable possible.
You've had a lifetime of it.

03:32.421 --> 03:35.132
I told Jack that I wanted you to have
a better understanding

03:35.132 --> 03:36.300
of what we're doing here.

03:36.800 --> 03:40.721
He was against it, but I persuaded him
because he wants what's best for you.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.891
And so do I. Do you believe that?

03:46.560 --> 03:48.937
- Do you trust me?
- What do you mean?

03:48.937 --> 03:50.272
It's a simple question.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.065
No, it's not.

03:53.650 --> 03:54.818
Okay. Fair.

03:59.364 --> 04:02.576
You noticed that I was nervous.

04:03.869 --> 04:08.123
It's because there are some things
that happened at Rockefeller Center

04:08.123 --> 04:09.541
that we haven't talked about yet,

04:09.541 --> 04:13.879
and I'm worried that when we do,
they will upset you.

04:15.964 --> 04:18.257
I literally have no idea
what you're talking about.

04:20.928 --> 04:21.928
I know.

04:24.515 --> 04:25.682
I wanna show you something.

04:33.232 --> 04:34.233
What's on the tape?

04:34.900 --> 04:39.446
Typically, I wouldn't do this so soon,
but the trial is coming up fast.

04:42.533 --> 04:43.534
What's on the tape?

04:43.534 --> 04:45.661
I think we should just watch it
together. Okay?

04:45.661 --> 04:47.371
I don't know what this is.
I would like to be done.

04:47.371 --> 04:49.581
I'm sorry, but we don't have
any more time, Danny.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.259
The jewelry store across the street
had a new camera.

05:00.259 --> 05:02.302
They didn't find this footage
until recently.

05:03.011 --> 05:04.012
It's a copy.

05:05.514 --> 05:06.890
The original's in evidence.

05:13.522 --> 05:14.982
You've done something to the tape.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.609
No.

05:20.195 --> 05:21.196
It's a trick.

05:22.698 --> 05:23.699
It's not a trick.

05:24.408 --> 05:27.995
And I think somewhere inside you,
you know that.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.548
There was no one at Rockefeller Center
except you.

05:41.258 --> 05:42.593
Just you.

05:43.719 --> 05:45.345
You were the shooter, Danny.

05:46.847 --> 05:50.350
Not Ariana. Only you.

05:53.270 --> 05:56.231
It was always you.

06:05.657 --> 06:06.658
Sleep.

06:09.077 --> 06:10.078
Big mistake, lady.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.208
You make big mistake.

06:16.001 --> 06:17.002
Yitzhak?

11:02.496 --> 11:03.956
All right, listen up.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.681
I said, "Let's be fucking cool."

11:21.181 --> 11:22.224
I'm not asking.

11:22.224 --> 11:25.602
This is bullshit.
You gotta let me in there.

11:25.602 --> 11:27.271
I'm not afraid of the guard.

11:28.814 --> 11:31.149
Everybody told you to leave the boy alone.

11:33.569 --> 11:35.445
You're making a terrible mistake.

11:35.445 --> 11:39.575
Why do you have to make this trouble, huh?
I do not listen to you!

11:39.575 --> 11:43.912
God, I'm such a fucking idiot.
I shouldn't have listened to her.

11:43.912 --> 11:45.622
Let me out. I can handle her.

11:45.622 --> 11:48.500
- Shit, man. She's gonna call the guards.
- That would be less than ideal.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.210
Mike, if you wouldn't mind--

11:52.421 --> 11:56.842
You hear me? The boy was fine.
The boy was safe.

11:56.842 --> 11:59.469
- You're not supposed to be here, man.
- Oh, Danny.

12:01.138 --> 12:04.057
I'm afraid he's right, my boy.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.310
You really shouldn't.

12:06.894 --> 12:08.729
At least not like this.

12:10.898 --> 12:12.441
What is going on here, Jack?

12:12.441 --> 12:14.902
Don't send him out there.
He won't make it.

12:41.720 --> 12:44.765
- What the fuck was that?
- How is that even possible?

12:44.765 --> 12:46.058
Quite frankly, it shouldn't be.

12:46.058 --> 12:47.851
You piss me off! You hear me?

12:50.020 --> 12:51.813
Yitzhak, what are you doing?

12:51.813 --> 12:52.898
...piss me off!

12:52.898 --> 12:55.150
- I can do it.
- Oh, yeah, that's a wonderful idea.

12:55.150 --> 12:57.361
Let's put a junkie in charge of our fates
because that's worked out

12:57.361 --> 12:58.278
so well in the past.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.905
- Fuck you, Jack. I'm clean.
- No.

12:59.905 --> 13:03.408
- Mike.
- No. I can't do it right now.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.118
Yitzhak.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.495
Stop.

13:06.495 --> 13:08.580
He hurts her, things are gonna go to shit.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.541
He's not gonna touch her.
You know how he is about women and kids.

13:10.541 --> 13:12.417
- What about the guards?
- Why don't you take the spot

13:12.417 --> 13:14.419
- if you're so decisive?
- 'Cause I need to think!

13:14.419 --> 13:16.839
I'm not fucking with you.
You tell many lies.

13:16.839 --> 13:18.298
<i>You gotta let me get in there.</i>

13:18.298 --> 13:20.592
If he hurts anyone,
we're gonna go to solitary.

13:20.592 --> 13:23.387
I told you where this was gonna go
when you started dealing.

13:23.387 --> 13:24.847
So this is my fault?

13:24.847 --> 13:27.474
How do you put food on the table,
you Goody Two-shoes piece of shit?

13:27.474 --> 13:30.561
I said we were gonna end up in jail,
and look where we are!

13:30.561 --> 13:32.646
The guards are right there, Danny.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.233
- Let's go, guys. Move.
- I am not scared of them.

13:36.859 --> 13:38.110
I give no shit!

13:39.027 --> 13:40.445
Oh, for fuck's sake, Mike!

13:43.240 --> 13:48.370
- Stop, you'll make it worse.
- Think of Danny. Come on. Mike.

13:56.587 --> 13:57.713
We're good, right?

13:57.713 --> 14:00.340
Danny, is that you?

14:02.050 --> 14:03.760
Yeah, we're good, sis. We're good.

14:08.098 --> 14:11.852
- We're good. It's okay.
- I'm trying to help you.

14:11.852 --> 14:13.562
- Nice and easy, kid.
- Come on.

14:13.562 --> 14:15.063
- I know you are.
- Turn around.

14:15.564 --> 14:17.399
- Sorry.
- Go back.

14:26.783 --> 14:28.869
No. Nothing fancy, buddy. Take the shot.

14:29.745 --> 14:30.746
Hit me.

14:30.746 --> 14:33.498
Close. You gotta focus. Take another one.

14:33.498 --> 14:36.376
- Again.
- Take the shot!

14:37.211 --> 14:38.545
I always have no luck.

14:38.545 --> 14:41.256
I never have any luck.

14:41.256 --> 14:43.133
- The same, no?
- The same.

14:49.056 --> 14:50.766
Set the pick. Don't let him shoot that!

14:56.146 --> 14:57.523
How is it what happened happened?

14:58.398 --> 15:00.025
He never came here awake before.

15:00.692 --> 15:04.029
- The system is breaking down, I'm afraid.
- What system?

15:04.530 --> 15:06.782
- Us.
- Come on. Right here.

15:06.782 --> 15:10.911
The center cannot hold.
The beast is slouching towards Bethlehem.

15:12.579 --> 15:13.580
Yeats.

15:16.542 --> 15:18.669
I'm sorry I lose shit so bad.

15:18.669 --> 15:21.129
You're not here for your
scintillating conversational skills.

15:21.672 --> 15:23.757
We need you to lose your shit
now and then.

15:24.550 --> 15:27.511
Unfortunately, this is a problem
that will not be solved by fisticuffs.

15:28.887 --> 15:29.888
I blame myself.

15:30.722 --> 15:34.434
She was hideously persuasive.
Best ones always are.

15:34.434 --> 15:35.519
The best what?

15:35.519 --> 15:36.603
Liars.

15:38.105 --> 15:39.356
This is on me, I'm afraid.

15:40.315 --> 15:44.069
So, we're not letting him
talk to the doctor lady anymore?

15:44.069 --> 15:46.321
I think we've just seen
compelling evidence

15:46.321 --> 15:50.200
that that relationship is
no longer productive. Don't you?

15:51.994 --> 15:53.161
She's becoming dangerous.

15:54.413 --> 15:56.748
That seems not very much likely
to me, Jack.

15:56.748 --> 15:59.001
Is that right?
You're an expert now, are you?

15:59.001 --> 16:01.587
In danger? Yeah.

16:07.301 --> 16:08.552
So when do we wake him up?

16:09.511 --> 16:11.513
We don't wake him up
till we have a plan.

16:15.684 --> 16:17.853
- Jack.
- Twenty-one.

16:19.104 --> 16:20.898
Do you know what happens
when they diagnose you

16:20.898 --> 16:22.774
with a psychiatric disorder
in this country?

16:24.484 --> 16:25.611
Try and cure you.

16:26.320 --> 16:28.238
As far as she's concerned,
we're the disease.

16:28.238 --> 16:31.825
To cure Danny
means getting rid of all of us.

16:31.825 --> 16:32.910
That's crazy.

16:34.745 --> 16:36.580
We are the only one keeping Danny alive.

16:37.748 --> 16:40.542
As I said, we need a plan.

17:37.766 --> 17:40.185
Let's go. C's in the mess hall.

17:45.065 --> 17:49.278
Let's go! Every day
the same thing with you, Jackson.

17:56.618 --> 17:58.203
Hey, you know anywhere
I can score some blow?

17:58.203 --> 18:00.706
Keep your fucking voice down.
Piece of shit.

18:04.042 --> 18:06.170
- What the fuck is this shit?
- Move it along, Sullivan.

18:06.170 --> 18:08.130
- Hold on. What the fuck is this food?
- Move!

18:08.130 --> 18:09.298
- Okay.
- Right now.

18:09.298 --> 18:12.634
I'm moving. Jesus Christ.

18:24.521 --> 18:25.522
I got in your order.

18:28.066 --> 18:29.985
- Excuse me?
- What you were asking for.

18:32.196 --> 18:35.532
You said you wanted more.
I told you, I get things done.

18:35.532 --> 18:36.992
Holy shit.

18:38.452 --> 18:39.745
That was fast.

18:46.919 --> 18:47.836
Art supplies?

18:47.836 --> 18:49.963
Not the exact ones,
but they're pretty close, right?

18:50.547 --> 18:53.050
What the fuck am I supposed to do
with some crayons?

18:53.634 --> 18:55.761
I don't give a shit.
Stick it up your ass or something.

18:55.761 --> 18:57.930
Look, I don't want these, okay?
Trade these with me.

18:57.930 --> 18:59.848
- Take 'em back.
- Don't nobody want those, man.

18:59.848 --> 19:00.933
Now, pay up, asshole.

19:00.933 --> 19:02.976
For some fucking crayons? Are you nuts?

19:02.976 --> 19:05.771
Dude, come on. Look, I need some coke.
Help me out here. Please.

19:05.771 --> 19:06.855
You playing me?

19:22.746 --> 19:23.830
What's up?

19:27.835 --> 19:29.002
Yo. What's up?

19:43.684 --> 19:44.685
Yo, what's up?

19:45.435 --> 19:47.437
Which one of you assholes
can get me some blow, huh?

19:47.938 --> 19:50.858
- Fuck off.
- I take it that means you. What's up?

19:50.858 --> 19:52.693
Yo, is this punk-ass for real?

19:52.693 --> 19:55.070
I'll take whatever. Speed.
I just need something to tide me over.

19:55.070 --> 19:56.864
- You feel me?
- You don't understand English?

19:57.656 --> 20:00.409
- Fuck off.
- What's your problem, dude?

20:00.409 --> 20:02.619
- You're my problem, bitch.
- Hey!

20:03.579 --> 20:05.998
This little prick
just welched on Marcello.

20:05.998 --> 20:07.791
That is what we would call
a misunderstanding.

20:10.043 --> 20:12.754
Come on, I was gonna pay.
It's just a joke.

20:12.754 --> 20:14.590
You can't take a joke, dude?

20:15.424 --> 20:16.675
Goddamn it.

20:35.527 --> 20:37.321
I destroy you, motherfucker.

20:44.244 --> 20:47.164
Childish, stupid, utterly irresponsible.

20:47.164 --> 20:48.957
Goddamn it, Jonny. What is wrong with you?

20:49.917 --> 20:54.421
- Down! Everybody down!
- Get on the ground!

20:56.465 --> 20:58.133
I'm not babysitting this piece of sh--

20:58.133 --> 21:00.719
We're on a razor's edge here.
Just do as you're fucking told.

21:00.719 --> 21:02.930
- What the hell, Sullivan?
- Get down!

21:02.930 --> 21:05.265
- Get do-- Put that down!
- Drop it now!

21:05.265 --> 21:08.018
Yitzhak, I've got this, old boy.

21:14.733 --> 21:18.320
Gentlemen, please allow me to explain--

21:28.413 --> 21:30.415
And you're gonna look like shit
for your hearing tomorrow.

21:48.016 --> 21:49.434
Easy, Fay Wray, it's me.

21:49.935 --> 21:53.272
- You scared the shit outta me.
- Jesus. You hungover or something?

21:53.772 --> 21:55.190
I just didn't sleep at all.

21:55.691 --> 21:58.110
- Yeah, you look tired.
- Thank you, Stan. You're a peach.

21:58.610 --> 22:00.404
Well,
I hope you were up praying for a miracle

22:00.404 --> 22:01.989
'cause we're gonna need one
for this to go our way.

22:01.989 --> 22:03.991
Thought you said that
the judge agreeing to meet us

22:03.991 --> 22:05.534
was a great sign.

22:05.534 --> 22:09.246
No, I said it wasn't a bad sign.
Nothing about this case is great.

22:09.246 --> 22:11.540
Does your defeatist attitude
help your clients?

22:11.540 --> 22:13.125
It's not an attitude, it's realism.

22:14.459 --> 22:18.130
They have to accept the diagnosis.
He's too sick to stand trial.

22:18.130 --> 22:20.340
He needs to be in a hospital.
They have to see that.

22:20.340 --> 22:21.758
They don't have to do anything.

22:22.384 --> 22:25.345
Look, I get this would be a big deal
for your career and all, all right.

22:25.345 --> 22:27.055
I'm trying to help him out, Stan.

22:27.055 --> 22:31.226
Okay, you and I both know
what you got riding on this, right?

22:31.226 --> 22:33.312
And in this case,
what's good for you is good for me.

22:34.354 --> 22:36.648
Yeah, of course going to a hospital
will be better for the kid.

22:36.648 --> 22:37.733
Who wants to go to prison?

22:39.484 --> 22:42.404
Typically, the DA does like
a plea bargain.

22:44.239 --> 22:47.284
Don't get giddy.
The operative word here is "typically."

22:48.660 --> 22:50.454
In this case,
it's in everyone else's interest

22:50.454 --> 22:51.830
that this go to trial.

22:51.830 --> 22:53.874
He's clearly sick.

22:54.499 --> 22:57.085
You think they care about him being sick?
They're like you and me,

22:57.085 --> 22:59.087
they care about themselves
and their careers.

22:59.671 --> 23:02.716
And the giant ball-ache they'll be facing
when the press finds out

23:02.716 --> 23:04.593
the Rockefeller shooter gets off
scot-free.

23:05.093 --> 23:06.553
Nobody's talking about scot-free.

23:06.553 --> 23:08.597
I'm talking about
a secure treatment facility.

23:09.097 --> 23:10.098
It doesn't matter.

23:10.682 --> 23:14.311
Papers sell on scandals.
And that's exactly what this will be,

23:14.311 --> 23:15.687
if this doesn't go to trial.

23:16.313 --> 23:19.399
So saying that he's got something
that no shrink in the world thinks is real

23:19.399 --> 23:21.068
looks good for not a single person.

23:21.068 --> 23:22.444
So why are you bothering?

23:23.237 --> 23:28.367
Because a long shot is still a shot.
And I fucking hate going to court.

23:30.786 --> 23:33.455
Anything else come up in your little chats
I should know about?

23:33.455 --> 23:37.334
Since he saw the video footage,
he's been totally withdrawn.

23:37.960 --> 23:38.961
Why did you show him?

23:40.170 --> 23:43.382
I wasn't gonna let him hear
about his diagnosis for the first time

23:43.382 --> 23:44.466
in a proceeding.

23:45.217 --> 23:47.052
Reaction to this is unpredictable.

23:47.052 --> 23:48.554
He could have gone catatonic.

23:48.554 --> 23:52.057
He was an inch away
from assaulting me, Stan, and he likes me.

23:52.057 --> 23:56.186
He could have attacked a judge
or a lawyer for the other side.

23:56.186 --> 23:58.480
- And how could that have gone?
- Okay. So he know--

23:58.480 --> 24:00.691
He knows now
that he's more than one person?

24:01.191 --> 24:03.151
Maybe a lot more than one.

24:03.151 --> 24:04.528
Oh, come on.

24:04.528 --> 24:07.573
I'd like to begin
by introducing Dr. Whitman.

24:08.073 --> 24:10.492
He is a world-renowned psychiatrist

24:10.492 --> 24:14.872
and author of five medical journals
specializing in mental illness.

24:15.455 --> 24:17.332
He's also the honors recipient of

24:17.332 --> 24:21.044
the American Psychological Association's
E.L. Thorndike Award.

24:21.545 --> 24:23.297
Have you assessed the defendant
in relation

24:23.297 --> 24:25.841
to the defense's reported diagnosis?

24:26.341 --> 24:27.759
No, Your Honor.

24:27.759 --> 24:31.221
After reading Dr. Goodwin's report,
I didn't need to.

24:32.181 --> 24:36.393
I can't diagnose someone
with a condition that doesn't exist.

24:36.393 --> 24:37.477
Are you serious?

24:37.978 --> 24:39.730
Multiple personality

24:39.730 --> 24:44.067
is not recognized as an emotional disorder
by the American Psychiatric Association.

24:44.067 --> 24:46.737
- It's listed in the ICD.
- It's listed as a form of hysteria.

24:46.737 --> 24:48.113
You can't decide
a diagnosis doesn't exist.

24:48.113 --> 24:49.907
It's an emotional neurosis,
not a mental disorder. It--

24:49.907 --> 24:50.991
Enough.

24:51.825 --> 24:53.076
This is not a free-for-all.

24:53.660 --> 24:56.079
If you can't keep your opinion to yourself
until the appropriate time,

24:56.079 --> 24:57.664
you may be asked to leave, Doctor.

24:58.874 --> 24:59.875
Go on.

25:00.584 --> 25:06.340
To claim that someone can't stand trial
for a violent crime due to a disorder

25:06.340 --> 25:09.468
that the vast majority
of the medical profession

25:09.468 --> 25:14.139
doesn't even acknowledge is real,
in my view, it's ludicrous.

25:14.806 --> 25:17.309
I'm sorry.
But that's my professional opinion.

25:18.268 --> 25:21.021
Thank you, Doctor.
Let's bring the defendant in, shall we?

25:21.021 --> 25:23.190
Your Honor, we'd like to talk about
some of our findings.

25:23.190 --> 25:26.360
We've all read Dr. Goodwin's report.
Let's see for ourselves, shall we?

25:27.277 --> 25:28.278
Okay.

25:35.035 --> 25:36.161
Take a seat, please.

25:38.330 --> 25:39.331
You okay?

25:39.915 --> 25:40.958
Yeah.

25:41.959 --> 25:42.960
What happened to your face?

25:45.212 --> 25:49.800
Danny, listen, I know this could be scary,

25:49.800 --> 25:53.095
but these people are going to help you

25:53.095 --> 25:55.514
even if it doesn't seem
like that at first.

25:56.014 --> 25:58.475
You just need to tell the truth,
and we're gonna be able to get you

25:58.475 --> 26:01.103
the treatment that you need. Okay?

26:01.103 --> 26:04.314
Now, Danny, this pretrial hearing
is just for us to make sure

26:04.314 --> 26:05.858
that you are treated fairly. Understand?

26:07.943 --> 26:08.777
Counselor.

26:09.611 --> 26:13.448
Hello, Danny. I'm Patricia Richards.

26:13.448 --> 26:15.784
I'm the district attorney for your case.

26:16.702 --> 26:18.620
Is it okay if I ask you a few questions?

26:20.664 --> 26:22.165
Danny, do you know where you are?

26:22.833 --> 26:24.835
A meeting room. Rikers Island.

26:24.835 --> 26:27.588
How is it
that you came to be here at Rikers Island?

26:28.172 --> 26:31.675
For an incident involving a firearm
at the Rockefeller Center.

26:32.259 --> 26:34.761
And do you understand
that you're due to stand trial

26:34.761 --> 26:36.930
- for this incident?
- Yes.

26:36.930 --> 26:38.307
Do you know what that means?

26:39.016 --> 26:41.560
That a jury will
decide whether I'm guilty or innocent.

26:42.144 --> 26:46.106
Thank you, Danny.
You did really well. That's all I need.

26:47.524 --> 26:49.693
- You're up.
- Stan, wait.

26:49.693 --> 26:51.278
- Is there any problem?
- Yes.

26:51.278 --> 26:53.363
- Yeah, yes.
- No. No, Your Honor.

26:53.947 --> 26:55.532
Then please proceed, Counselor.

26:58.452 --> 27:01.413
Hi, Danny. It is Danny, isn't it?

27:03.415 --> 27:04.499
No commentary, please.

27:07.169 --> 27:09.338
Yes, sir. It's Danny.

27:09.338 --> 27:12.716
Look, I just got a couple questions
for you here, and then you're done. Okay?

27:13.717 --> 27:16.470
Can you tell us who you were with
in Rockefeller Center

27:16.470 --> 27:18.639
- on the day of the incident?
- With?

27:20.974 --> 27:22.893
Well, there was lots of people there obviously.

27:23.810 --> 27:26.188
People on the sidewalk
coming in and out of shops.

27:26.188 --> 27:29.024
Right, but who was with you, Danny?

27:31.026 --> 27:32.778
I'm sorry,
I don't really understand the question.

27:33.695 --> 27:35.781
Who did you go to Rockefeller Center with?

27:35.781 --> 27:36.698
It's not Danny.

27:36.698 --> 27:37.783
Stop.

27:38.367 --> 27:40.827
No one. I was alone.

27:41.537 --> 27:45.207
But you know you said in your statement
that you were in Rockefeller Center

27:45.207 --> 27:48.335
with someone else.
There's someone with a gun. You--

27:48.335 --> 27:50.379
- No leading, Mr. Camisa.
- Okay.

27:50.379 --> 27:52.714
Honestly, sir, I was alone
and if you don't believe me,

27:52.714 --> 27:54.216
then I suggest you watch the video.

27:54.216 --> 27:56.802
- It's not Danny.
- Quiet, please.

27:58.929 --> 28:00.097
All right.

28:00.097 --> 28:04.184
In your sessions with Dr. Goodwin,
you spoke at length about your housemates,

28:04.184 --> 28:09.356
Ariana and Ya-- Yitzhak.
Can you just tell us about them?

28:09.356 --> 28:13.819
Well, Ariana and I
had a connection as soon as I saw her,

28:13.819 --> 28:15.612
and Yitzhak came with her.

28:15.612 --> 28:17.489
Before I knew it, we were living together.

28:17.489 --> 28:19.867
And how would you describe them?

28:20.450 --> 28:21.952
Ariana and Yitzhak?

28:23.620 --> 28:27.457
Ariana is kind, calm,
somewhat like a tabby.

28:28.584 --> 28:30.586
Only softer, maybe more like a Burmese.

28:30.586 --> 28:32.421
Whereas Yitzhak is feral.

28:32.421 --> 28:34.464
You really wouldn't wanna be
on the wrong side of him.

28:34.464 --> 28:36.341
Danny, now I'm a little confused here.

28:37.050 --> 28:39.636
Well, you asked me
about Ariana and Yitzhak.

28:41.138 --> 28:42.139
My cats.

28:44.474 --> 28:46.226
This isn't-- This is not Danny.

28:46.226 --> 28:49.730
Your Honor, this is Jack.
This is one of Danny's alter egos.

28:49.730 --> 28:53.525
I said quiet. One more word and I will
have you removed from this room.

28:53.525 --> 28:55.903
Now, sit down, Doctor, please.

28:59.114 --> 29:01.283
Do you have anything else
you want to ask your client?

29:08.624 --> 29:09.791
No, Your Honor. That's all.

29:10.709 --> 29:13.420
- Could you wait outside, please?
- Doctor.

29:14.505 --> 29:15.672
Thank you.

29:17.716 --> 29:20.385
Your Honor,
as I said before, that wasn't Danny.

29:22.095 --> 29:25.933
Dragging us all out here to listen
to your perfectly lucid client

29:26.892 --> 29:28.310
describe his pets.

29:28.310 --> 29:31.063
- Your Honor, as I said before, I wasn't--
- Did I ask you to speak?

29:31.563 --> 29:34.358
Counselor, I'd prepare for trial. Pronto.

29:34.358 --> 29:36.109
Your Honor, please.
If I could have a minute--

29:36.109 --> 29:38.028
Stan, if you wanna do right
by your client,

29:38.028 --> 29:39.655
don't piss me off anymore.

29:40.239 --> 29:42.491
And when you talk, it pisses me off.

29:44.743 --> 29:46.078
Okay.

29:52.417 --> 29:54.711
Okay, look, he pleads guilty,

29:54.711 --> 29:57.005
you drop the charges down
to a misdemeanor,

29:57.005 --> 29:59.550
and then he goes away
to a mental hospital for a long time.

30:00.050 --> 30:00.968
You're joking, right?

30:00.968 --> 30:02.719
Come on, Patty. It's a good deal.

30:02.719 --> 30:05.472
For your client.
My bosses will have my ass.

30:05.472 --> 30:09.184
He doesn't belong in prison. Okay?
He needs treatment.

30:09.184 --> 30:12.980
He shot a firearm into a crowd
of unarmed people and then fled the scene.

30:12.980 --> 30:16.066
But he's got a disease, Patty.
Don't you see that?

30:16.066 --> 30:17.526
So he gets a pass?

30:17.526 --> 30:20.362
Well, I think going to
a mental hospital should suffice.

30:20.362 --> 30:23.365
He deserves the benefit of the doubt here,
doesn't he? A second chance.

30:24.616 --> 30:26.118
I'm gonna make you a wager, Stan.

30:27.160 --> 30:30.289
When I look hard at him,
and I'm gonna look at him real hard--

30:30.831 --> 30:32.666
I'm gonna find a history of violence.

30:32.666 --> 30:36.253
I'm gonna find that somehow
he managed to slip through the cracks.

30:36.837 --> 30:41.884
He shot people in Midtown
in broad daylight, and you want a pass?

30:42.593 --> 30:45.721
Rikers is filled with
young Black and brown men

30:45.721 --> 30:47.514
who did far less. Where was their pass?

30:47.514 --> 30:50.559
Where was their plea bargain
when they needed a break?

30:50.559 --> 30:52.394
Your client will get
the benefit of the doubt

30:52.394 --> 30:54.980
because he has
the privilege of a justice system

30:54.980 --> 30:56.982
that was built for people
who look like him,

30:57.900 --> 30:59.860
but he's not gonna get a pass from me.

31:00.694 --> 31:05.073
So, no. I'm not just gonna plead him out.
We're going to trial.

31:20.339 --> 31:21.423
You think you won?

31:22.132 --> 31:24.176
Do you know what a federal prison is like?

31:24.176 --> 31:26.512
It makes this place look like
a summer camp.

31:26.512 --> 31:28.514
You think that Yitzhak can protect him?

31:29.723 --> 31:32.351
Yitzhak still only has got
Danny's body weight.

31:32.351 --> 31:34.353
You're all still just one person.

31:34.937 --> 31:37.022
They're gonna eat you alive in there.

31:37.022 --> 31:39.483
I hope this little ruse
was worth it to you, Jack.

32:04.341 --> 32:06.260
So, what do we do now?

32:07.553 --> 32:10.472
We stand trial,
take our punishment like a man.

32:10.472 --> 32:12.432
We do what we always do. We survive.

32:12.432 --> 32:14.309
I can't handle a whole trial, man.

32:14.309 --> 32:16.854
- I can do it.
- Or not.

32:16.854 --> 32:20.232
What about what she says happens
in prison?

32:20.232 --> 32:22.651
She has no idea what we're capable of.

32:24.236 --> 32:26.530
- What if the woman is right?
- About what?

32:27.739 --> 32:28.866
Maybe we are the problem.

32:29.992 --> 32:32.119
Maybe the boy needs to stand
on his own two feet.

32:32.119 --> 32:33.745
What the fuck are you saying, man?

32:34.705 --> 32:38.417
He needed us to survive, yes,
but maybe not anymore.

32:40.127 --> 32:41.837
What? Like he's grown out of us?

32:43.505 --> 32:45.716
Jack, you are always saying,
"face the music," right?

32:47.176 --> 32:50.554
- Yes.
- So, maybe it's time for Danny to do that.

32:53.932 --> 32:56.476
This is bullshit. Danny needs us.

32:56.476 --> 32:57.728
Maybe he's right.

33:01.565 --> 33:04.610
You understand what you're suggesting
here, old boy, don't you?

33:05.986 --> 33:06.987
Yeah.

33:07.863 --> 33:11.658
We just fucking die?

33:13.452 --> 33:15.579
Is it so bad to make
this kind of sacrifice?

33:16.079 --> 33:17.748
You mean, you're fucking with me?

33:17.748 --> 33:19.833
Shut up, Jonny, for once in your life.

33:25.923 --> 33:27.007
It's amazing, isn't it?

33:27.758 --> 33:29.259
To love someone so much.

33:30.469 --> 33:33.263
To want to protect their existence
so fiercely, you'd do anything.

33:35.891 --> 33:36.892
You'd die for them.

33:44.816 --> 33:45.817
Or kill for them.

33:48.654 --> 33:52.074
Sorry, old friend.
He simply can't survive without us.

34:23.522 --> 34:24.648
Hi, Danny.

34:25.315 --> 34:28.860
Ari. Been so worried about you.

34:29.862 --> 34:31.362
It's good to see you, Danny.

34:31.362 --> 34:32.822
They keep asking me where you went,

34:32.822 --> 34:34.491
and they think I did something to you.

34:36.159 --> 34:37.995
I'm good. It's cool.

34:37.995 --> 34:41.415
No. No, it's not cool.
I'm in some deep shit, Ari.

34:42.833 --> 34:45.168
Don't worry, we're gonna figure it out.

34:49.797 --> 34:50.882
Yeah, okay.

35:00.267 --> 35:01.727
Where the fuck are we?

35:04.813 --> 35:07.566
You're the most important person
in my life. Do you know that?

35:08.775 --> 35:09.818
You're freaking me out.

35:10.819 --> 35:14.114
We have a connection, right?

35:16.200 --> 35:17.201
Yeah. Absolutely.

35:17.743 --> 35:22.497
And that connection, it's because
I kind of live for you, Danny.

35:23.874 --> 35:27.419
Because I am you, Danny. We're all you.

35:41.141 --> 35:44.978
I was alone at Rockefeller Center.
You weren't with me.

35:45.729 --> 35:50.734
I was with you, in here and in here.

35:52.319 --> 35:53.570
But you left me.

35:53.570 --> 35:56.281
I never left you. I never will.

35:56.823 --> 35:58.867
None of us want to leave you, dear boy.

35:59.535 --> 36:01.203
We're only here to help you.

36:02.246 --> 36:03.330
That's what we do.

36:10.254 --> 36:12.214
Can't go back to sleep this time, Danny.

36:12.214 --> 36:13.423
We need each other.

36:14.842 --> 36:16.927
- For what?
- To live.

36:19.346 --> 36:21.515
It's empty when you're asleep out there.

36:24.226 --> 36:27.396
Sometimes I sneak in
when no one's watching, to dream with you.

36:32.025 --> 36:35.821
We come when you need help,
or are too lonely or too scared.

36:38.991 --> 36:40.742
I come here to take your loneliness.

36:49.042 --> 36:51.879
Being close to other people
is just too painful for you.

36:52.629 --> 36:55.257
Hurts too much. So that's when I show up.

36:56.842 --> 36:58.760
- Have you always known?
- What?

37:00.262 --> 37:01.305
Well, that you're not real.

37:02.389 --> 37:04.933
No, not usually.

37:06.268 --> 37:09.771
Only when we're here. Like now.

37:15.360 --> 37:16.612
Are there other people like me?

37:17.821 --> 37:19.781
No, Dan, you're special.

37:29.041 --> 37:31.710
You made us, all of us.

37:34.463 --> 37:35.631
Who are all these people?

37:37.132 --> 37:38.133
They're all you.

37:38.675 --> 37:42.012
They each had a purpose
one time or another. Not anymore.

37:43.972 --> 37:45.682
Jack calls them undesirables.

37:49.895 --> 37:50.896
Yitzhak.

37:52.314 --> 37:54.274
Jack mostly stays behind the scenes,

37:54.274 --> 37:59.154
but if things start to
get too out of control, he sorts us out.

38:01.365 --> 38:02.366
Indeed.

38:03.200 --> 38:06.119
See, what happened with Marlin and Adam
in this barn,

38:07.788 --> 38:11.250
it made you want to die, Danny.
Do you remember?

38:12.543 --> 38:13.544
But you didn't.

38:15.379 --> 38:20.300
You broke like a piece of glass.
You broke into many pieces.

38:20.300 --> 38:22.344
All you, all separate.

38:24.763 --> 38:29.101
Guardian angels, here to help you live.

38:31.144 --> 38:32.813
Why are you telling me this now?

38:33.438 --> 38:34.940
Something's changed.

38:34.940 --> 38:37.901
You came here, Danny, awake.

38:39.027 --> 38:40.904
Now that's never happened before.
It shouldn't.

38:41.822 --> 38:46.243
That woman wants to take us away from you.
She wants to destroy us.

38:47.160 --> 38:51.164
- Rya.
- She believes we are a sickness.

38:52.040 --> 38:54.209
She wants to send you to a place
where they'll give you medications

38:54.209 --> 38:56.128
and treatment to try to kill us.

38:56.128 --> 38:57.671
We wouldn't be able to help you.

38:58.422 --> 39:00.465
They don't understand what you need,
but we do.

39:01.216 --> 39:02.551
We need your help, man.

39:02.551 --> 39:06.430
I'm afraid that if we all die...

39:08.891 --> 39:09.892
you die too.

39:12.519 --> 39:13.854
What do you want me to do?

39:13.854 --> 39:17.608
Well, you need to get rid of her.

39:18.734 --> 39:22.154
It has to be you because she'll know
if it's one of us by now.

39:23.739 --> 39:26.283
Tell her you want her to have
no connection with your case at all.

39:26.283 --> 39:30.120
That you cannot
and you will not plead insanity.

39:30.120 --> 39:31.622
But then I'll go to jail.

39:31.622 --> 39:33.290
It may not be a significant sentence.

39:33.290 --> 39:35.542
No one was badly hurt after all,
were they?

39:36.335 --> 39:40.255
And I really need your help, Danny.
We all do.

39:43.342 --> 39:47.012
You know what to do, my boy.
And you know that you should do it.

39:59.525 --> 40:00.526
Good lad.

40:39.857 --> 40:43.902
You know, I get that
I am of no significance to you, Jack.

40:44.653 --> 40:48.407
And yes, this journey has included
some enlightened self-interest on my part.

40:48.407 --> 40:53.996
Sure. But making a fool of me
is very hard to swallow,

40:53.996 --> 40:57.791
considering all I've been trying to do
is help you.

41:01.211 --> 41:04.673
I know that you can hear me
in there, Danny.

41:04.673 --> 41:08.510
And if you wanted to fight a little bit,
you could.

41:10.596 --> 41:12.931
But you clearly want to go to prison,

41:13.599 --> 41:17.060
or you wouldn't have put on that
fantastic fucking performance yesterday.

41:18.228 --> 41:19.229
Be my guest.

41:20.230 --> 41:23.483
I put my entire fucking career on the line
for this bullshit.

41:28.405 --> 41:30.115
I don't know why the fuck I came.

41:30.616 --> 41:31.450
Please.

41:39.166 --> 41:41.293
There are voices in my head.

41:45.756 --> 41:47.633
There's other people in here.

41:55.599 --> 41:57.392
I'm begging you.

42:02.439 --> 42:05.442
Help me. Please.

42:10.614 --> 42:11.615
I'm here.
