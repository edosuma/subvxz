09:08.347 --> 09:10.415
For maxine.

09:10.449 --> 09:13.686
Her property, hmm?
Her stolen property.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.287
Now we're gonna prove to you

09:15.321 --> 09:18.524
That max was lured
to a fancy part of town

09:18.558 --> 09:20.259
With a promise
of a better life,

09:20.294 --> 09:23.429
Given a new foofy haircut,
pampered lifestyle,

09:23.463 --> 09:26.666
Leaving behind not only those
most loyal to her,

09:26.700 --> 09:30.437
But also her own true identity.

09:30.471 --> 09:36.276
Now, I understand we all lose
our way from time to time,

09:36.310 --> 09:41.047
Forget where we come from
and what's most important.

09:41.081 --> 09:46.086
But to those that loved us,
we owe it to them to come home.

09:52.325 --> 09:54.726
Pushing the basketball game
back to Friday?

09:54.761 --> 09:56.362
Yep.

09:57.736 --> 09:57.736
+

09:59.716 --> 10:02.417
<i>Huh!
Hey, I'm sorry, sir,</i>

10:02.452 --> 10:04.086
But I-I lost my job
after I broke my arm.

10:04.120 --> 10:05.854
And my father is ill.

10:05.888 --> 10:10.058
<i>All right, all right.
Whatever, just don't shoot.</i>

10:10.092 --> 10:12.528
<i>May I...?
I'm really starving.</i>

10:12.562 --> 10:15.097
<i>Yeah, go right ahead.
Try the pepperoni.</i>

10:15.131 --> 10:17.666
<i>Nah, I'm a mozzarella man.
Ooh, it's good.</i>

10:17.701 --> 10:19.801
<i>Good, good.
Take this and go, huh?</i>

10:19.836 --> 10:21.971
<i>Thank you.
Now, you have a nice day.</i>

10:22.005 --> 10:24.439
<i>And again, I'm so very sorry
for this, okay?</i>

10:24.474 --> 10:25.840
<i>Okay, great. Great.</i>

10:25.875 --> 10:29.911
<i>Ah. Deep dish.
I love it.</i>

10:29.945 --> 10:31.179
Ugh.

10:31.213 --> 10:33.881
Ugh. That is very hard
for me to watch.

10:33.949 --> 10:36.583
I'm not that mad man,
I swear.

10:36.618 --> 10:38.518
Why did you pick a pizza joint
to rob?

10:38.552 --> 10:41.988
Well, I always heard
pizza joints

10:42.022 --> 10:44.590
Had lots of cash around.

10:44.625 --> 10:46.525
Really?
Yeah.

10:46.560 --> 10:49.795
Oh. Well, since the gun was,
um, a dairy product,

10:49.829 --> 10:52.097
We can probably get
the weapons charge dismissed.

10:52.132 --> 10:53.732
Pindar: Plus,
it's your first offense.

10:53.766 --> 10:54.933
Best case, we get robbery

10:54.967 --> 10:56.601
Reduced
to misdemeanor assault.

10:56.636 --> 10:58.136
You get three years' probation
and no jail time.

10:58.170 --> 11:00.738
Wow.
You guys are amazing.

11:00.772 --> 11:02.606
Yeah, we are dynamic,
aren't we?

11:02.641 --> 11:03.874
We're like a dynamic duo.

11:03.909 --> 11:05.676
We're not a duo
of any kind.

11:05.710 --> 11:07.244
Oh, you can't deny
that there are two of us.

11:07.279 --> 11:09.013
Watch me. I'm gonna get some
coffee. You want anything?

11:09.047 --> 11:10.081
No.

11:10.149 --> 11:13.285
I'll...Get...Black.

11:17.023 --> 11:19.125
So you didn't take lulu
to the pound?

11:19.159 --> 11:21.995
I think lulu was dumped
by her owner

11:22.029 --> 11:23.630
In a nice,
safe neighborhood

11:23.664 --> 11:24.965
Hoping someone
would pick her up.

11:24.999 --> 11:27.034
She's lucky the coyotes
didn't get her.

11:27.068 --> 11:30.637
Ms. Steele, the paloma bag
you're carrying --

11:30.672 --> 11:31.772
Is that real?

11:31.840 --> 11:33.907
It is. A gift
from my ex-husband.

11:33.942 --> 11:35.843
I guess it holds some
sentimental value.

11:35.877 --> 11:37.978
Do you know how much
that bag costs?

11:38.013 --> 11:40.847
Yes. Uh,
somewhere around 75 grand.

11:40.882 --> 11:43.517
Gun to your head.

11:43.552 --> 11:48.789
A thief says, "hand over your
paloma bag or your dog lulu."

11:48.823 --> 11:50.190
Which is it?

11:50.224 --> 11:52.860
Objection. This case is not
about a stolen bag.

11:52.894 --> 11:55.662
What opposing counsel
doesn't understand

11:55.697 --> 12:00.067
Is a dog isn't property
like a car or a purse,

12:00.101 --> 12:02.936
Albeit a very perfect
paloma bag,

12:02.971 --> 12:06.240
Which we'll discuss later
at great length.

12:06.274 --> 12:09.943
Overruled.
So...The bag or the dog?

12:09.977 --> 12:11.778
That's easy.

12:11.812 --> 12:14.882
I can live without a bag,
but not without my dog.

12:14.916 --> 12:17.918
And I'll do anything
to keep her.

12:17.952 --> 12:19.787
No further questions.

12:22.856 --> 12:27.794
Cold and flu germs can live up
to 48 hours on hard surfaces.

12:27.828 --> 12:29.796
You're an embarrassment
to the american bar association.

12:29.830 --> 12:30.797
I aim high.

12:30.831 --> 12:31.965
Nice suit.
Thanks.

12:31.999 --> 12:33.300
His compliment
isn't genuine.

12:33.334 --> 12:35.969
My partner is known
for his biting sarcasm.

12:36.003 --> 12:37.637
Is that true?
Not at all.
When we're done,

12:37.672 --> 12:39.806
I'm gonna buy that suit from you
for a million dollars.

12:39.840 --> 12:41.241
Damien.

12:41.275 --> 12:43.676
What are you doing
with this turd of a case?

12:43.744 --> 12:45.578
Hey, just because
lady justice is blind

12:45.612 --> 12:47.980
Doesn't mean
she cannot hear...Sir.

12:48.015 --> 12:49.715
Who's that guy?

12:49.750 --> 12:50.983
He's nobody.
Look, let's just do this quick

12:51.017 --> 12:53.118
So we can get back
to our lives.

12:53.153 --> 12:54.319
Misdemeanor
with probation.

12:54.353 --> 12:57.121
Love to, but this
is a real crime.

12:57.156 --> 12:59.991
Your client's robbery
has gone viral.

13:00.025 --> 13:01.692
My boss wants to make
an example out of gentleman jim

13:01.760 --> 13:03.861
So that others
don't get the idea

13:03.895 --> 13:06.097
That if they just steal with
good manners and a squirt gun,

13:06.131 --> 13:08.366
They won't do
any jail time.

13:08.401 --> 13:10.135
[ chuckles ]
I'm sorry, damien.

13:10.169 --> 13:12.271
But that poor sap's going away
for five years.

13:15.642 --> 13:17.343
Did he just say
five years?

13:17.378 --> 13:19.346
Who's gonna take care of
my father if I'm gone
for five years?

13:19.380 --> 13:21.281
Relax. It's just
a preliminary hearing.

13:21.316 --> 13:22.850
I shouldn't
have listened.

13:22.884 --> 13:24.018
"listened"?

13:24.052 --> 13:25.186
Who told you
that lucky louie's

13:25.220 --> 13:26.354
Had a bunch of cash
lying around?

13:26.388 --> 13:28.322
No one.
This was my master plan.

13:28.356 --> 13:30.024
Oh, and it worked great.

13:30.058 --> 13:32.893
Jim, if someone put you up
to this, he's a co-conspirator.

13:32.927 --> 13:35.963
And if you give us his name, we
can get you a lighter sentence.

13:35.997 --> 13:37.230
No way. No way.

13:37.265 --> 13:40.266
Maybe I make cheese,
but I'm no rat.

13:43.670 --> 13:44.904
Rossi: The plaintiff
would like to call

13:44.938 --> 13:46.872
Mr. Patrick meisner
to the stand.

13:46.906 --> 13:48.207
Objection, your honor.

13:48.241 --> 13:50.042
There is no patrick meisner
on the witness list.

13:50.077 --> 13:51.811
Your honor, sorry,

13:51.846 --> 13:53.313
We attempted to deliver a new
witness list last night,

13:53.348 --> 13:55.182
But our messenger was
pulled over for speeding.

13:55.216 --> 13:57.318
And who knew?
He had two priors, so...

13:57.352 --> 13:58.786
Haven't heard that one
before.

13:58.820 --> 14:01.189
It's so lame
we're okay with it.

14:01.223 --> 14:02.757
Thanks.

14:02.792 --> 14:04.393
Bush league.

14:04.427 --> 14:07.763
Mr. Meisner, will you please
remind the jury where you work?

14:07.798 --> 14:10.199
The east valley animal shelter
in woodland hills.

14:10.233 --> 14:11.800
Is it true
that evanthia steele,

14:11.835 --> 14:14.136
Who says she found the dog
in santa monica,

14:14.170 --> 14:17.139
Drove 15 miles to your
rescue center in woodland hills?

14:17.174 --> 14:19.909
Yes, that's correct.
Wow. Really?

14:19.944 --> 14:21.944
And where did she tell you
she found the dog?

14:21.978 --> 14:24.080
In woodland hills.
Woodland hills?

14:24.114 --> 14:25.682
Why not las vegas?

14:25.716 --> 14:27.951
Jango: Now,
why would a westsider

14:27.985 --> 14:30.220
Venture into your center
in the valley

14:30.255 --> 14:31.922
With a missing pet?

14:31.957 --> 14:34.792
Well, sometimes dog owners
embed a computer chip in the dog

14:34.826 --> 14:35.927
With a name and address.

14:35.961 --> 14:37.128
If the dog
doesn't have this,

14:37.162 --> 14:39.364
It makes it very easy
for the finder

14:39.398 --> 14:41.700
To claim the dog
as theirs.

14:41.734 --> 14:44.903
Objection. Speculation.
Sustained.

14:44.937 --> 14:46.805
Did this dog
have a chip in it?
No, it did not.

14:46.839 --> 14:48.707
Mr. Meisner, how many
days are required

14:48.741 --> 14:50.341
Before someone can claim
ownership of a lost pet?

14:50.376 --> 14:51.976
10 days.

14:52.010 --> 14:55.246
On what day did ms. Steele
arrive to claim maxine?

14:55.280 --> 14:57.248
She was at my door
when I opened

14:57.283 --> 14:59.984
On the morning
of the 10th day.

15:00.019 --> 15:01.386
Thank you, mr. Meisner.

15:01.420 --> 15:04.255
No further questions,
your honor.

15:04.289 --> 15:06.257
Your honor,
given ms. Steele is on record

15:06.292 --> 15:09.127
Saying she'd do anything
to save that dog,

15:09.161 --> 15:13.097
We would like that dog placed
in custody of a third party.
What?

15:13.132 --> 15:16.001
Judge douglas:
Counselors in my chambers.
You may step down.

15:17.369 --> 15:18.970
Well, we were wrong.

15:19.004 --> 15:20.838
I guess you guys do take
the "hail mary" cases, huh?

15:20.906 --> 15:23.275
'cause you got no shot
at winning this one.

15:23.309 --> 15:25.743
Yeah. Nice loafers.
Thanks, they're italian.

15:25.778 --> 15:26.978
Really, that's the best
you've got?

15:27.012 --> 15:28.079
I'm tired, all right?

15:28.113 --> 15:30.081
[ sighs ]

15:30.115 --> 15:32.116
[ indistinct conversations ]

15:34.252 --> 15:36.486
Stanton,
I saved that dog's life.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.354
I'm sure you did.

15:38.388 --> 15:40.356
But my lawyers
don't believe me.

15:40.390 --> 15:43.425
Oh, well,
they'll come around.

15:43.459 --> 15:45.894
If only you had come
around the house more.

15:45.928 --> 15:49.432
Well...
You know I want to, darling.

15:49.466 --> 15:52.034
But [sighs] emotions --

15:52.068 --> 15:54.837
They get complicated
the morning after.

15:54.871 --> 15:56.873
Yes, but there's
something to be said

15:56.907 --> 15:58.308
About living
in the moment.

15:58.342 --> 16:00.410
And at this very moment,

16:00.444 --> 16:03.547
We must save
your beloved lulu.

16:03.582 --> 16:04.582
Oh.

16:21.332 --> 16:23.567
Peter:
They can't be serious.

16:23.601 --> 16:25.535
The prosecution is calling
ms. Steele a flight risk?

16:25.569 --> 16:27.270
Yes,
she is a desperate woman

16:27.304 --> 16:29.138
Who has said that she can't live
without this dog.

16:29.173 --> 16:30.573
That sounds like
a flight risk to me.

16:30.607 --> 16:32.308
Your honor,
that is ridiculous.

16:32.342 --> 16:33.943
Given what I've heard
in testimony today,

16:33.977 --> 16:35.344
I'm going to agree
with the plaintiff.

16:35.379 --> 16:37.813
The dog will be placed
in the custody

16:37.848 --> 16:39.215
Of the los angeles
animal control shelter

16:39.249 --> 16:40.883
Until custody
can be determined.

16:40.917 --> 16:42.584
Your honor, you can't put
lulu in the county pen.

16:42.619 --> 16:44.219
She's too pretty.

16:44.254 --> 16:45.954
Rossi: Well, if defense is
so concerned about the dog,

16:45.989 --> 16:48.558
They could take custody
until verdict is reached.

16:48.592 --> 16:50.360
Why don't you?
We have cats.

16:50.394 --> 16:51.961
You would.

16:51.996 --> 16:53.196
Judge douglas:
Franklin and bash, your call.

16:53.230 --> 16:56.166
The dog goes with you
or to the pound.

16:56.200 --> 16:57.567
[ sighs ]
we'll take it.

16:57.602 --> 16:59.236
Him.
Her.

16:59.271 --> 17:00.838
Shut up.

17:00.872 --> 17:02.340
They don't even know
the gender of the dog.

17:02.374 --> 17:03.941
You can't take it
'cause you have cats.

17:03.976 --> 17:05.576
Yes, seven of them.
Ugh!

17:05.611 --> 17:07.477
You have cats!
Yeah.

17:07.512 --> 17:09.313
You look like a cat.
Meow, mother...

17:10.325 --> 17:10.325
+

17:37.708 --> 17:40.543
Oh, god, how can he stand
the smell?

17:40.578 --> 17:41.911
This is where
he makes his cheese.

17:41.945 --> 17:44.280
That doesn't answer
my question.

17:44.348 --> 17:45.848
[ sighs ]
you get it.

17:45.882 --> 17:47.182
No, you get it.
Get it.

17:47.217 --> 17:48.184
No.
Get it.

17:48.218 --> 17:49.619
Oh, god.

17:49.686 --> 17:51.954
You're wasting your time.
I'm not talking.

17:51.989 --> 17:53.423
What are you making?

17:53.457 --> 17:54.957
Camembert.

17:54.991 --> 17:57.293
It's his specialty.

17:57.328 --> 17:59.395
Sweeney: The secret
to a good camembert

17:59.429 --> 18:01.464
Is turning the molds
every six hours

18:01.499 --> 18:02.966
To allow the whey
to drain evenly.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.602
Damien: Actually, the secret
to a good camembert

18:05.636 --> 18:07.737
Is a decent cabernet
to save its sorry ass.

18:07.771 --> 18:09.739
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah.

18:09.773 --> 18:11.808
Pindar: Listen --
the jury has to understand

18:11.875 --> 18:13.409
Why you robbed
lucky louie's.

18:13.444 --> 18:15.511
You needed rent money
so you and your sick father

18:15.546 --> 18:16.880
Wouldn't end up
on the street.

18:16.914 --> 18:18.748
But to establish that,

18:18.782 --> 18:20.450
We have to
put you on the stand.

18:20.484 --> 18:21.651
That I can do.

18:21.718 --> 18:22.985
Good, but once
you're on the stand,

18:23.020 --> 18:24.888
The prosecution can
cross-examine you.

18:24.922 --> 18:27.423
And then if they ask you
whether you worked alone,

18:27.457 --> 18:28.991
You have to tell them
the truth.

We have to open the books

But the judge instructed the
jury to ignore what lulu did.

28:14.247 --> 28:16.948
Yeah, but, you know,
you can't erase a memory.

The jury now sees kerry
as lulu's choice.

Evanthia, it's not over.

28:24.089 --> 28:25.923
It feels like it.

Lulu being here made this house
not feel so lonely anymore.

You know, you and stanton
seem to get along well.

we're not married anymore.

One last question,
mr. Gianelli.

that the gun wasn't real?

No.

a loaded weapon at you

Mr. Gianelli, were you scared

When jim sweeney pointed
in your direction

What you believed
to be a deadly weapon?

The first half of last year,
correct?

Yeah, that's correct.
We were down about 20%.

the last couple of months?

30:26.642 --> 30:29.477
Business picked up
almost 15%

30:29.511 --> 30:31.113
Since the robbery was caught
on your security cameras

30:31.147 --> 30:33.649
And went viral,
isn't that correct?

30:33.683 --> 30:34.883
Yeah, I guess so.

30:34.917 --> 30:37.486
Even the blind pig
finds the acorn.

30:37.520 --> 30:40.755
Would I be accurate
if I said

30:40.790 --> 30:42.257
That getting that robbery
on camera

30:42.291 --> 30:43.658

one of the best things

Yes, it is.

at stonebridge security?

memory is its sense of smell?

32:34.875 --> 32:36.409
80%, roughly.

32:36.443 --> 32:39.378
So it's fair to say that
if enough time has passed,

32:39.413 --> 32:41.880
A dog would remember
someone by smell

Before recognizing them
visually?

Oh, sure.

not the person.

wearing belonged to him,

36:50.128 --> 36:52.096
Because I wanted her
to have a good home.

36:52.130 --> 36:54.199
Now I know she does.

36:54.266 --> 36:56.201
Thank you for everything.
Of course.

36:56.268 --> 36:58.670
Here.

36:58.704 --> 36:59.971
I want you to have this.

37:00.006 --> 37:02.107
No. I-I couldn't.

37:02.141 --> 37:04.842
Please.

37:04.877 --> 37:07.111
Yeah, thank you.

37:07.146 --> 37:09.680
Besides, I saw one
just like it at target.

37:09.715 --> 37:11.983
Hey, what do you say
we call this one a tie?

37:12.017 --> 37:14.118
They say ties are kind of
like kissing your sister,

37:14.153 --> 37:16.354
But in this case,
my sister's hot.

37:16.388 --> 37:18.189
Well, in that case,

37:18.223 --> 37:20.024
You should bring her
by the house sometime.
Sure.

37:20.058 --> 37:21.358
Hey, we heard you guys might be
having a party this weekend.

37:21.393 --> 37:22.827
Yeah.
We could
clear our schedules.

37:22.861 --> 37:24.162
Hey, when you're ready,
the phone will ring.

37:24.196 --> 37:27.298
All right.
Get out of here.
[ laughs ]

37:27.332 --> 37:28.866
You enjoy being taller,
don't you?

37:28.900 --> 37:30.301
So much.

37:30.336 --> 37:31.869
[ sighing ] ohh.

37:31.904 --> 37:33.904
Has the jury
reached a verdict?

37:33.939 --> 37:35.139
We have, your honor.

37:35.173 --> 37:38.642
To the charge of robbery,
not guilty.

37:38.676 --> 37:41.645
To the charge of assault,
not guilty.

37:41.679 --> 37:44.381
To the charge
of petty theft, guilty.

37:44.415 --> 37:46.850
Oh, god! No! No!

37:46.884 --> 37:48.185
No, no, no,
this is good news.

37:48.219 --> 37:49.753
Petty theft
is just a misdemeanor.

37:49.821 --> 37:51.321
It's probation.
There's no jail time.

37:51.356 --> 37:52.389
This is what we wanted.

37:52.423 --> 37:53.390
This is good.
Fantastic.

37:53.424 --> 37:54.858
It's very good.

37:54.892 --> 37:56.192
How much do I owe you?

37:56.227 --> 37:58.061
This one's on us.
Oh, no, no, no, it's not.

37:58.095 --> 37:59.930
We charge a fee now
at infeld-daniels.

37:59.964 --> 38:02.299
I want 12 wheels
of your camembert.

38:02.333 --> 38:03.800
You got it.

38:03.834 --> 38:05.368
And I'm gonna throw in
my suit for you.

38:05.402 --> 38:07.704
[ chuckles ]

38:07.738 --> 38:08.871
Sarcasm.

38:10.207 --> 38:12.175
I got two lawyers
I want to recommend to you.

38:12.209 --> 38:14.444
Yeah? Why don't you make
a hockey stick

38:14.478 --> 38:18.081
Out of some parmesan
and shove it up your ass?!

38:18.115 --> 38:19.682
We should do this
more often.

38:19.717 --> 38:21.718
Oh, can we?

38:24.956 --> 38:29.692
Listen, fair warning,
if I pull my ear like this,

38:29.727 --> 38:32.229
It means
don't stick around.

38:32.263 --> 38:34.364
You're hooking up
with evanthia tonight?

38:34.398 --> 38:38.101
Well, we have been known
to reunite occasionally.

38:38.135 --> 38:39.702
It's none of my business,

38:39.737 --> 38:41.237
But do you think
that's a good idea?

38:41.271 --> 38:42.939
I mean, if evanthia's
holding out hope

38:42.973 --> 38:44.708
That she still has a chance
with you...

38:44.742 --> 38:45.708
[ doorbell rings ]

38:45.743 --> 38:47.143
Unless you're hoping

38:47.211 --> 38:50.279
You still have a third chance
with her?

38:52.382 --> 38:54.216
She ended it with you.

38:56.152 --> 38:58.120
I haven't got this far,
hanna,

38:58.154 --> 38:59.354
By taking no
for an answer.

38:59.389 --> 39:01.456
Evanthia!
Stanton?

39:01.491 --> 39:04.060
What the he--
you stole the dog again?

39:05.829 --> 39:07.129
Who's that?

39:07.164 --> 39:09.065
We brought you a rescue.
Her name's tabatha.

39:09.100 --> 39:10.867
Hey, I used your razor.
What?

39:10.902 --> 39:12.503
Oh.

39:12.537 --> 39:15.407
What's up?

39:15.441 --> 39:18.210
Um, andre said I could have
visiting rights, so...

39:18.244 --> 39:19.911
I don't really
need that dog.

39:19.945 --> 39:21.746
Maybe one of you
should take it.

39:21.780 --> 39:23.748
No. No pets or children
allowed in my...

39:23.783 --> 39:24.749
Allergies.

39:24.783 --> 39:26.417
I remember.

39:26.452 --> 39:28.887
When I brought that bichon home
when we were first married.

39:28.922 --> 39:31.289
Yeah. I remember.

39:31.324 --> 39:33.425
Sweet. Uh-huh.

39:33.459 --> 39:34.860
I better be going.

39:34.927 --> 39:39.364
Liverpool playing
man u. On the...Dish.

39:39.399 --> 39:41.500
Um...Evanthia...

39:41.535 --> 39:43.436
Evanthia...

39:45.339 --> 39:47.440
...As always.

39:47.475 --> 39:49.176
Always good to see you,
stanton.

39:50.946 --> 39:52.213
Hmm.

39:54.917 --> 39:56.151
Andre!

39:56.185 --> 40:01.256
Andre! Andre!

40:01.290 --> 40:03.992
Jared: I don't know if I care
for this new normal --

40:04.026 --> 40:05.894
Being equity partners,
making rain,

40:05.961 --> 40:07.929
Having to handle
corporate jackasses.

40:07.963 --> 40:10.031
Peter: It's about
taking the right cases.

40:10.065 --> 40:13.400
We have to change the culture,
not have the culture change us.

40:13.468 --> 40:15.035
Well, then I don't
want to get motorcycles.

40:15.069 --> 40:16.036
Why not?
'cause.

40:16.070 --> 40:18.071
Dude,
riding a motorcycle

40:18.106 --> 40:19.940
Is emblematic
of all things rebel.

40:19.974 --> 40:22.343
And we are nothing,
if not total badass rebels.

40:22.377 --> 40:23.511
Right, but we were badasses
to begin with.

40:23.545 --> 40:25.213
We don't need motorcycles
to prove it.

40:25.247 --> 40:26.381
Come on, boy.

40:26.415 --> 40:28.016
You better not
be talking to me.

40:28.050 --> 40:31.020
Come on, skeletor.

40:31.054 --> 40:32.354
We're not calling it
skeletor.

40:32.389 --> 40:34.190
We're not calling her
clapton.

40:34.225 --> 40:35.926
Okay, well, how about no name
because we're not keeping it

40:35.960 --> 40:37.828
Until we just find a good home
for her, right?

40:37.862 --> 40:40.898
Hello.

40:40.932 --> 40:42.433
How you doing?

40:42.467 --> 40:43.901
[ meows ]

40:43.935 --> 40:45.035
Jared?

40:45.070 --> 40:46.137
Yes, peter.

40:46.171 --> 40:49.373
Did clapton just pee
on my leg?

40:49.407 --> 40:51.242
No...

40:51.276 --> 40:53.577
But skeletor did.

40:57.416 --> 40:59.884
Come on...Skeletor.
