00:08.100 --> 00:12.880
They say Lucifer,
the most radiant of angels,

00:14.460 --> 00:16.490
was a favorite of god.

00:18.510 --> 00:21.800
And God loved him
more than other angels.

00:24.400 --> 00:27.870
But when he found out that
Lucifer had violated his rules...

00:28.090 --> 00:30.930
I am on my own! Kiss
my ass! No no no...

00:33.090 --> 00:35.090
God did not know mercy.

00:50.080 --> 00:52.990
The United States began to strike

00:53.070 --> 00:55.820
Al-Qaida terrorist training camps

00:56.170 --> 01:00.960
and military facilities of the
Taliban regime in Afghanistan.

01:02.670 --> 01:05.470
Thumb, thumb, where have you been?

01:05.550 --> 01:08.170
With this brother,
with this brother went to the forest.

01:08.780 --> 01:11.950
With this brother,
with this brother, I ate porridge,

01:12.190 --> 01:14.360
With this brother,
with this brother sang songs!

01:14.440 --> 01:16.870
With this brother,
with this brother, I ate porridge,

01:17.050 --> 01:19.130
With this brother,
with this brother sang songs!

01:19.210 --> 01:23.390
Sang songs, sang songs,
yes played, Four brothers amused!

01:23.470 --> 01:28.000
Sang songs, sang songs,
yes played, Four brothers amused!

01:28.860 --> 01:30.910
Mom, why dad didn't go?

01:31.430 --> 01:35.490
John, you know dad
works. But we still have fun!

01:35.850 --> 01:37.950
Are you sure they will be there?

01:38.420 --> 01:41.790
Of course! It's your birthday!
And this is a special day.

02:18.460 --> 02:20.800
Is everything alright, Aunt Nina?

02:21.610 --> 02:23.620
Yes. And you?

02:26.450 --> 02:28.950
We missed the turn to the pool!

02:29.730 --> 02:31.730
We are not in the pool.

02:32.720 --> 02:35.660
Today is a special day and I
will take you to a special place.

02:56.210 --> 02:58.210
Sir?

02:58.590 --> 03:01.550
What brings you here on Sunday?

03:01.640 --> 03:05.200
I want to show something. With
regards to Massimo and his team.

03:15.690 --> 03:17.940
He was able to hack into the
system and change the VAR.

03:21.660 --> 03:23.660
Are you sure Massimo knew about this?

03:25.140 --> 03:29.080
No, but if these are tricks of his
team, then he no longer controls them.

03:30.790 --> 03:33.750
And in any case,
he can no longer be trusted.

03:34.120 --> 03:37.430
I can find out from
lawyers about the dismissal.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.820
Mrs. Stuart called.

03:41.910 --> 03:45.280
Your wife took her children to the
pool, but they did not appear there.

03:46.220 --> 03:48.220
Mrs. Morgan is not answering calls.

04:25.400 --> 04:28.550
I believe the changes
will be significant.

04:28.700 --> 04:31.450
In our country there
is a certain continuity...

04:32.170 --> 04:34.170
Will you make some coffee?

04:35.160 --> 04:37.160
Come in.

04:48.270 --> 04:51.780
So why did you come?
Worried about being arrested.

04:52.630 --> 04:54.630
Why?

04:54.720 --> 04:58.680
I heard they want to close the
investigation. What happened?

04:59.990 --> 05:04.250
Dominic pulled the
strings? Or is this a rule -

05:05.090 --> 05:08.300
you, large financiers,
can not be touched? AND?

05:16.700 --> 05:23.970
Yes? I'll take a shower and come
right away. I have to go, I'm sorry.

05:25.300 --> 05:27.470
Yes. Daddy is calling, you're running.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.560
This is my own business.

05:30.060 --> 05:32.390
This is because your
wife died because of him.

05:37.860 --> 05:39.860
You loved Carrie, right?

05:55.340 --> 05:57.340
Glad to meet you!

06:40.380 --> 06:42.680
Hey. Hey.

06:43.690 --> 06:46.170
I thought there would be
dinner with a couple of friends...

06:47.880 --> 06:54.020
Just do not be angry. We are
celebrating! My new exhibition!

06:54.920 --> 06:57.040
I got a call from a gallery
in Kensington Palace!

06:57.120 --> 06:59.170
They want to exhibit my paintings.

06:59.470 --> 07:02.030
Ahhh. You said they were snobs?

07:02.120 --> 07:04.480
Yes, they really are still snobs.

07:04.800 --> 07:08.130
But they fell in love with my paintings,
which means I fell in love with them.

07:08.620 --> 07:10.620
I love you.

07:12.340 --> 07:14.340
Hello!

07:14.660 --> 07:17.900
Where's the new one? Is that German?

07:18.250 --> 07:20.250
Eleanor Yes! You did not call her?

07:20.430 --> 07:22.430
No.

07:23.120 --> 07:25.120
Damn chauvinists.

07:26.130 --> 07:28.130
Hey what's her name?

07:30.190 --> 07:32.700
If I were you,
I would forget about her.

07:32.930 --> 07:35.660
Because I just got
married? Because it's a man.

07:36.130 --> 07:38.180
Then do not. Already
forgot. What if you like it?

07:38.260 --> 07:41.140
You have to get a tattoo
like mine! No no no no.

07:42.120 --> 07:44.230
Yes, she is very sweet. Beautiful,
is not it?

07:44.310 --> 07:47.430
You have to do the same! But a great idea!
- No...

07:47.510 --> 07:50.990
That-that, that-that, that-that,
that-that! No! Never! In no case!

07:51.080 --> 07:53.800
Tattoo! Tattoo! Tattoo!
Tattoo! Come on!

07:53.880 --> 07:55.920
No! I said no! Come on! Tattoo!

08:13.720 --> 08:17.160
You know,
I had one too. What are their names?

08:17.900 --> 08:20.320
Who are the husbands? No honey

08:20.570 --> 08:24.020
I definitely don’t need a husband.
I'm about who invests my money.

08:24.250 --> 08:26.640
Mmmm. Only mine can’t.

08:27.040 --> 08:30.550
- Why? - "Buy yourself a house!

08:30.630 --> 08:32.880
Real estate is a great
investment. "Yeah.

08:32.960 --> 08:35.669
"Gays are not ruined."
And he was taken for delay.

08:35.760 --> 08:39.669
No! What was the
guarantor in your mortgage?

08:39.750 --> 08:42.270
The salary? Another property?

08:42.490 --> 08:45.760
Only work. I'm a freelancer,
sweetheart.

08:46.650 --> 08:49.560
I went to the bank and
signed a bunch of papers.

08:49.640 --> 08:51.730
This is much easier than blowjob.

08:53.730 --> 08:56.230
So. Everything is ready. Thank.

08:56.310 --> 08:58.550
What do you say? Great, great.

09:11.680 --> 09:15.630
Yes. Yes Yes Yes...

09:23.960 --> 09:25.970
Hey honey. Yes.

09:26.630 --> 09:29.450
You are walking? What is it?

09:29.700 --> 09:32.270
I’m looking at how many
of my bank's securities are.

09:32.360 --> 09:34.690
It is very interesting!

09:34.780 --> 09:38.120
Mortgage securities are
mortgage-backed securities.

09:38.280 --> 09:41.200
Bonds secured by
real estate mortgages.

09:41.280 --> 09:44.150
They are resold to other
banks as an investment.

09:44.240 --> 09:47.500
Yeah. Like how you
write someone a check.

09:47.580 --> 09:49.580
Exactly. So what's the problem?

09:49.770 --> 09:51.770
The problem is to find out

09:51.850 --> 09:53.850
Will a bond mortgage be paid?

09:54.360 --> 09:57.680
Your friend, for example,
could not pay the mortgage.

10:00.150 --> 10:02.150
I have been watching
this for a long time.

10:04.850 --> 10:06.850
And I'll go dance again.

10:09.850 --> 10:11.850
Sorry.

10:47.190 --> 10:49.240
Hello!

10:49.320 --> 10:51.350
Wake up and sing.

10:51.430 --> 10:54.410
We have a problem. Time to go.

11:07.260 --> 11:09.260
You were right.

11:09.340 --> 11:11.626
Subprime mortgages have not been
provided with anything since 2005.

11:11.650 --> 11:14.046
US banks give
mortgages right and left,

11:14.070 --> 11:16.070
generally without collateral.

11:16.190 --> 11:18.940
Property Exclusion
Index has skyrocketed!

11:20.800 --> 11:23.730
This is a soap bubble.
We risk losing money.

11:23.810 --> 11:25.810
If only...

11:26.920 --> 11:29.010
No! Are you crazy!

11:29.090 --> 11:31.750
The mortgage sector
is the most stable of all!

11:31.840 --> 11:35.400
Minimum percentage, minimum risk. This
is the first thing students are taught.

11:35.560 --> 11:37.560
Engage in trading, leave loans to me.

11:37.640 --> 11:39.640
Yes, the most boring. I answer

11:39.720 --> 11:42.420
for guaranteed profit!
Namely - for a mortgage!

11:42.500 --> 11:45.110
Guaranteed?! Now
mortgages are rubbish.

11:45.200 --> 11:47.200
We need to sell all the
mortgage assets right now,

11:47.280 --> 11:49.280
until they depreciate.

11:49.360 --> 11:52.720
Do it - lose a billion.
Let's wait - we’ll lose ten.

11:52.860 --> 11:54.860
Dominic, this is crazy.

11:54.940 --> 11:56.980
The Council will soon name a new CEO.

11:57.100 --> 11:59.100
You really wanna risk it all

11:59.180 --> 12:02.180
relying on the instinct of one who has
been here for a week without a year?

12:06.670 --> 12:08.670
Sell ​​it.

12:09.680 --> 12:11.680
Super.

12:18.990 --> 12:22.480
Millions of Americans
on the verge of poverty

12:22.570 --> 12:25.690
due to a sharp drop in the
index of low-quality mortgages.

12:41.760 --> 12:44.150
If it weren’t for you,
we would go broke on mortgages,

12:44.240 --> 12:46.450
and Dominic would not
have become a director.

12:47.080 --> 12:50.130
You are well done.
Or you just got lucky.

12:50.240 --> 12:54.670
Very interesting. Never mind.

12:55.100 --> 12:58.590
A typical British, still imagines
himself part of the colonial empire.

12:59.080 --> 13:03.010
American Home Mortgage Investment
filed for bankruptcy yesterday.

13:03.290 --> 13:05.780
BNP Pariba froze three funds,

13:05.860 --> 13:08.710
and Nothern Rock requested
funding from the Bank of England.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.900
I know. A tsunami is coming,
you need to be ready.

13:12.700 --> 13:14.700
What should I do?

13:16.830 --> 13:19.060
Come to my house today.
I will introduce my wife.

13:19.290 --> 13:21.290
I think you'll get along with her.

13:25.120 --> 13:27.470
He delivered a speech
where he continued to insist...

13:27.560 --> 13:30.840
Hi, this is Carrie,
I went to have fun. Leave...

13:32.280 --> 13:35.600
Guys! Dominic invited me to visit!

13:36.540 --> 13:40.850
Not a damn thing! It can not be!
What are you? Cool! Get fucked up!

13:41.720 --> 13:43.720
Straight home? Yes.

13:44.150 --> 13:47.360
He never invited anyone. More
precisely, he did not call any of us.

13:48.110 --> 13:50.350
It seems to be you. I'm listening.

13:51.020 --> 13:53.250
No, she went out for a moment.

13:54.010 --> 13:56.010
Greg? Hey.

13:57.940 --> 13:59.950
Let's move away. What?

14:00.290 --> 14:04.040
Carrie. She is in the
hospital. Overdose.

14:27.440 --> 14:29.440
Hey. Hey.

14:29.660 --> 14:31.660
How are you feeling?

14:35.340 --> 14:37.340
My stomach was washed.

14:38.050 --> 14:40.110
I called you a million times.

14:40.240 --> 14:42.240
I know, I'm sorry.

14:42.780 --> 14:44.780
Forgive me.

14:46.800 --> 14:48.800
What happened?

14:50.080 --> 14:52.080
I am a loser.

14:52.940 --> 14:54.940
My exhibition was closed.

14:57.420 --> 14:59.510
And I can’t... Hush,
hush, listen to me.

15:00.960 --> 15:02.960
We don't give a damn about them.

15:03.620 --> 15:05.620
You really have talent.

15:06.250 --> 15:08.250
You are talented.

15:11.400 --> 15:14.550
We are like communicating vessels:

15:15.800 --> 15:17.800
You got things up the hill

15:18.980 --> 15:20.980
and I'm going to hell.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Why aren't you in the
hospital with your wife?

15:42.950 --> 15:45.170
Who! I’m looking for staff members.

15:46.790 --> 15:49.870
You will become the head of the trading
department, you will also learn this.

15:50.210 --> 15:52.860
Vacancy is open. I will
recommend you advice.

15:55.210 --> 15:58.330
Do you understand, Massimo,
what are we selling here at the bank?

15:59.920 --> 16:02.870
Stocks, bonds, financial services...

16:03.030 --> 16:05.030
Our reputation.

16:05.440 --> 16:07.440
People give us money
because they trust.

16:10.130 --> 16:12.130
Are you alluding to Carrie?

16:12.760 --> 16:14.760
Think what’s best for her.

16:23.410 --> 16:26.340
Mr. Morgan is busy.
It is Sunday morning.

16:26.660 --> 16:28.660
And he invited me.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.280
Well. Will have to wait.

16:39.030 --> 16:42.450
Yes. Lawyers said there
would be no problem.

16:43.410 --> 16:45.710
The bank can fire him
without fear of sanctions.

16:47.430 --> 16:49.430
Now I got it,

16:49.510 --> 16:52.870
how Massimo Ruggiero was able to become the
youngest head of the trading department.

16:54.160 --> 16:56.160
Cheating.

17:02.720 --> 17:04.720
All Italians have it in their blood.

17:07.310 --> 17:09.750
You don't know anything about Massimo.

17:10.980 --> 17:12.980
Get out.

17:13.060 --> 17:15.130
But we cannot... I said out.

17:38.940 --> 17:41.230
The unemployment
rate is getting lower.

17:41.880 --> 17:44.580
But there are still people
in the countryside...

17:45.100 --> 17:47.820
Is Chris here too
because of Nina? For work.

17:47.970 --> 17:49.970
On Sunday?

17:50.050 --> 17:52.050
Nina can’t be found anywhere.

17:52.310 --> 17:56.280
She was about to take Ed's
children to the pool, but disappeared.

17:57.900 --> 18:00.090
And does not pick up the phone. Hm.

18:01.490 --> 18:03.490
Do you know what day it is?

18:07.880 --> 18:09.880
John's birthday. Yes.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.460
Please find her.

18:27.440 --> 18:31.380
ABOUT! Thank. How sweet. Hey.

18:34.130 --> 18:37.580
Get fucked up! This
is your boss’s house!

18:39.430 --> 18:42.160
Stunned. To be stunned.

18:44.210 --> 18:47.020
I know that such
people do not like me.

18:47.690 --> 18:49.880
The main thing is that they like you.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.610
And I like it when you're happy.

18:59.390 --> 19:01.390
Nice...

19:02.700 --> 19:05.080
I wanted to surprise you, I...

19:06.580 --> 19:08.650
I stopped taking pills.

19:10.270 --> 19:13.470
Maybe we will have a baby?

19:14.010 --> 19:16.010
Massimo! Hello!

19:16.740 --> 19:18.740
At last. I'm glad to see you.

19:19.190 --> 19:21.550
And you must be
Carrie. Glad to meet you.

19:21.640 --> 19:23.640
Nice to meet you. Come on in.

19:26.040 --> 19:30.150
I already dressed up in a strict dress,
why does she look more formal than me?

19:33.790 --> 19:36.710
My husband,
Dominic. Hi John. How are you?

19:36.800 --> 19:38.810
Fine. You look great!

19:41.240 --> 19:44.200
Massimo said that they
cut out your appendicitis.

19:44.890 --> 19:46.950
And this is our son, John. Hey.

19:47.040 --> 19:49.040
Hey. - Nice to meet. And me too.

19:49.400 --> 19:51.400
No no thanks. No thanks.

19:51.490 --> 19:53.490
Have a drink - Yes. Fine.

19:53.570 --> 19:56.400
Do you have soft
drinks? Yes of course.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.530
So when do you fly to
Bagram? In a few days.

20:00.670 --> 20:03.630
John joined the army,
he is sent to Afghanistan.

20:03.830 --> 20:06.650
Seriously? Operation Enduring Freedom.

20:07.770 --> 20:10.100
What an eloquent name!

20:10.640 --> 20:13.950
Despite the name,
I’m sure we will quickly manage.

20:14.130 --> 20:16.330
They will destroy
bin Laden and return.

20:16.900 --> 20:18.970
The main thing for
me is that he returns.

20:19.050 --> 20:21.380
Come on, find you some juice.

20:26.450 --> 20:29.350
Wow! You have such a
beautiful house. Thank.

20:30.600 --> 20:35.570
When I married Massimo, we
lived in a studio. And you are lucky.

20:36.390 --> 20:38.920
This is my family home. We bought it,

20:39.000 --> 20:41.130
after they fled from the
Stalinist regime in Poland.

20:41.220 --> 20:43.220
Seriously? But you know

20:43.300 --> 20:46.330
my father was an aristocrat,
but he could not handle money.

20:46.500 --> 20:48.950
Dominic bought it and
gave it to me for the wedding.

20:49.220 --> 20:52.660
Wow. Marriage is like a cocktail

20:52.780 --> 20:55.800
choose the right ingredients
and get a masterpiece.

20:55.920 --> 20:58.590
But if you make a mistake,
then you’ll just get drunk.

21:01.070 --> 21:03.070
And here are the girls,
I will introduce you.

21:05.720 --> 21:07.720
This is Claire Stewart.

21:07.810 --> 21:10.000
Hello,
nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.

21:10.570 --> 21:12.570
I'm glad your wife is feeling better.

21:13.720 --> 21:15.720
Yes.

21:17.240 --> 21:19.240
No longer consumes.

21:21.220 --> 21:23.220
I want to introduce
you to special friends.

21:23.300 --> 21:25.300
I already spoke with advice,

21:26.800 --> 21:28.870
the position of the
head of your trading.

21:33.680 --> 21:37.340
Thank. My thanks cannot
be expressed in words.

21:39.470 --> 21:41.470
I will work for wear.

21:41.780 --> 21:43.780
What about Carrie?

21:44.020 --> 21:46.020
Will she help you with this?

21:48.810 --> 21:51.540
What is this Massimo?
The new protege of Dominic?

21:52.140 --> 21:54.140
What does Edward say? Who!

21:54.450 --> 21:57.320
Trading? Edward is not
talking about work at home.

21:57.770 --> 22:01.530
Did you see his wife? Oh,
don't be a bitch. She is an artist.

22:01.810 --> 22:04.620
Loser! I saw her
exhibit in Kensington.

22:04.700 --> 22:06.800
It was closed because no
one was buying anything.

22:06.880 --> 22:10.200
The owner of this gallery
is my friend, and she said

22:10.280 --> 22:12.960
that they staged this
exhibition in the hope that

22:13.060 --> 22:15.560
that Massimo’s friends
will buy something.

22:16.170 --> 22:19.540
I think Massimo is with her
only because she is pretty.

22:21.370 --> 22:24.450
Actually, he's with me

22:24.530 --> 22:27.940
because I'm doing a great blowjob.

22:29.950 --> 22:31.950
Do you want to teach you?

22:38.800 --> 22:40.800
Dumb bitch!

22:47.040 --> 22:49.040
Carrie?

22:51.710 --> 22:54.490
I'm sorry,
Claire. She has a special situation.

22:54.830 --> 22:58.380
It can not be that she became
a bitch due to pregnancy.

22:58.940 --> 23:01.250
I’m not talking about pregnancy,
but about her husband.

23:01.510 --> 23:03.510
He's such a dull mattress.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.980
Do not worry,
this will remain our secret.

23:37.100 --> 23:40.470
Loser! I saw her
exhibit in Kensington.

23:42.080 --> 23:44.080
It was shut down.

23:47.500 --> 23:49.930
This is James Sherman
from the Treasury.

23:50.530 --> 23:53.190
And the woman is Margaret Cunningham,
a lobbyist.

23:53.620 --> 23:56.330
She and the Fed chairman
argue at least once a month.

23:56.410 --> 23:58.420
But these two... They
are our competitors.

23:58.950 --> 24:01.840
Fitzsimmons - CEO
of RJ Investment Bank.

24:02.080 --> 24:05.870
And Jean Duplessis,
ten billion hedge fund manager.

24:06.170 --> 24:09.820
Yes, Jean worked for the CIA, but
he wanted to make money in finances.

24:10.340 --> 24:12.800
Would you like a drink? No thanks.
- Thank.

24:12.970 --> 24:14.980
Come, I will introduce you to them.

24:15.110 --> 24:17.966
The British government guarantees all
deposits of the Northern Rock Bank.

24:17.990 --> 24:20.030
But here in England we
have nothing to worry about.

24:20.110 --> 24:23.840
This is for now. Glad to meet you.

24:25.250 --> 24:27.250
Massimo Ruggiero,
the new head of trading.

24:27.350 --> 24:29.350
Hello.

24:29.430 --> 24:33.310
Dominic talked a lot about you.
He really believes in your talent.

24:33.400 --> 24:35.730
Many thanks. What about you, John?

24:36.120 --> 24:40.090
What will you do after Afghanistan?
Come to work after school.

24:40.170 --> 24:42.356
Adrenaline from the exchange
does not compare with the war, but...

24:42.380 --> 24:46.260
No. Finances are not for me,
I’d better stay in the army.

24:46.750 --> 24:49.100
There are many ways
to protect your country.

24:49.200 --> 24:51.630
John decided to do it personally.

24:51.870 --> 24:53.870
And I am very proud of him.

24:54.730 --> 24:56.730
For John! For John! For John!

24:56.900 --> 24:59.690
For a brave young man,
like his father, a real...

24:59.780 --> 25:01.780
the killer...

25:03.950 --> 25:05.950
Enduring freedom.

25:08.470 --> 25:11.630
You do not care about freedom and
democracy. Carrie, stop it. Carrie, stop it!

25:11.730 --> 25:15.010
Only oil and money are
important to you, not democracy!

25:15.100 --> 25:18.400
Fucking imperialists! Enough, you're drunk.
- Dont touch me!

25:18.480 --> 25:20.920
You are drunk. I beg you...

25:22.230 --> 25:24.230
Think you can rule the world?

25:25.410 --> 25:27.410
But the problem is
that you are all rotten.

25:27.910 --> 25:30.830
You and the world also make a mess.

25:30.920 --> 25:33.680
So, let's get out of here.
I'll make you a cup of coffee.

25:33.760 --> 25:35.760
I do not feel good.

25:37.930 --> 25:40.490
Sorry. I'm sorry.

25:49.230 --> 25:52.090
Your friends washed all my bones

25:53.190 --> 25:55.190
as soon as I appeared.

25:55.920 --> 25:58.310
They looked down on me.

26:00.360 --> 26:02.360
But not you.

26:04.290 --> 26:06.290
You are kind.

26:08.660 --> 26:11.410
I screwed up, huh?

26:15.120 --> 26:17.120
Do you like Massimo?

26:19.010 --> 26:21.010
Do you wish him happiness?

26:21.470 --> 26:23.470
Yes.

26:25.220 --> 26:27.220
But constantly I’m
doing everything wrong.

26:30.440 --> 26:32.440
Maybe it's time

26:33.390 --> 26:35.460
finally do the right thing?

26:47.520 --> 26:49.520
First you want children

26:49.770 --> 26:52.706
and then you stage the stage before
the most important people in my career!

26:52.730 --> 26:55.120
What's wrong with you?
I put you in a bad light

26:55.200 --> 26:57.950
in front of friends? Afraid you
won’t be promoted anymore?

26:58.040 --> 27:00.040
What a fool you are. No,
you're an idiot!

27:01.510 --> 27:03.510
You and your friends.

27:03.700 --> 27:06.100
I do not like what they
have in their heads.

27:06.700 --> 27:10.340
I don’t like the way they say
how they dress, how they live.

27:11.450 --> 27:14.080
You know, it always seemed to
me that you were not like them.

27:14.820 --> 27:16.820
What are you better.

27:19.140 --> 27:21.140
But today I finally understood.

27:21.900 --> 27:24.520
Their world is your world.

27:25.350 --> 27:27.350
And you are happy in it.

27:28.230 --> 27:30.420
But not me. So what?

27:34.420 --> 27:36.420
Look at me!

27:37.820 --> 27:39.820
I'm leaving you.

27:41.240 --> 27:43.470
You got drunk and talk nonsense. No.

27:43.560 --> 27:45.560
I do not want... No!

27:47.080 --> 27:49.080
I'm leaving you.

27:52.800 --> 27:55.410
Stay in your shitty world. Well then,
go to hell!

27:55.490 --> 27:57.490
You... I feel better without you.

28:12.330 --> 28:14.330
Let's talk about

28:14.410 --> 28:16.580
how fast the stock price is falling.

28:16.660 --> 28:19.880
Bear Sterns Bank has to
ask for JP Morgan and the Fed

28:19.970 --> 28:22.350
loan for twenty-eight days.

28:22.640 --> 28:24.930
Seven minutes after
the start of trading

28:25.010 --> 28:27.300
the index fell 683 points.

28:27.400 --> 28:29.590
The Dow Jones just fell forty percent.

28:29.700 --> 28:32.240
Enough! - Quotes are falling.

28:32.990 --> 28:36.740
Stop trading! Listen to me,
damn algorithm!

28:38.800 --> 28:40.810
Your mother.

28:40.890 --> 28:43.680
The stock market is
minus twenty-one percent...

28:44.050 --> 28:46.740
And now for forty-three percent!

28:47.100 --> 28:49.430
What is happening on Wall Street?

28:49.520 --> 28:52.780
Bear Sterns Bank has existed
for over a hundred years.

28:52.860 --> 28:56.670
A couple of months ago,
its value was 350 billion dollars!

28:56.760 --> 28:59.230
It's impossible to look
at quotes! Just awful!

28:59.320 --> 29:01.320
Everything collapsed...

29:01.450 --> 29:03.600
No, honey. This is just the beginning.

29:08.230 --> 29:10.240
Hey. Are you new Good luck.

29:12.830 --> 29:15.940
Hey. The crisis will continue.

29:16.080 --> 29:20.270
Fortunately, we dumped
toxic assets and lose a little.

29:20.360 --> 29:22.690
What about credit
lines at other banks?

29:22.770 --> 29:25.200
If they go bankrupt,
they will drag us along.

29:25.280 --> 29:27.280
Get rid of them.

29:27.360 --> 29:29.940
Close credit lines at all banks.

29:30.260 --> 29:32.260
Even if it goes bankrupt.

29:34.430 --> 29:38.290
Be ruthless. Crisis is a great
opportunity to make money.

29:39.120 --> 29:42.220
I.e? We profit from the weakest.

29:42.520 --> 29:44.520
In America.

29:45.070 --> 29:48.310
We live in the last days of
the existence of this country.

29:50.590 --> 29:54.450
Five seconds later, the call in
the financial capital of the world

29:54.530 --> 29:58.870
will announce the opening of the
exchange, but we would not want this.

29:58.960 --> 30:02.030
Now the US is just as safe

30:02.230 --> 30:05.150
like Pearl Harbor on the morning
of December seventh forty-first.

30:05.740 --> 30:09.810
I have no doubt that Uncle Sam
ultimately nationalizes everything.

30:10.100 --> 30:13.060
This is all your greed! You
have inflated this bubble for years.

30:13.230 --> 30:16.290
In front of the feds, who were idle.

30:16.370 --> 30:19.870
And now you ask the government to
help you out? How pathetic you are.

30:20.350 --> 30:23.850
If the scale of the disaster is true.

30:24.430 --> 30:27.030
We will have to
nationalize so many banks,

30:27.110 --> 30:29.110
that the national debt will skyrocket.

30:30.120 --> 30:34.090
There are fewer buyers, and we are
printing dollars at the speed of light!

30:34.490 --> 30:36.490
If the market sees our bluff

30:36.690 --> 30:38.730
people will switch to other funds:

30:38.810 --> 30:41.560
Raw materials, gold, even the euro.

30:42.050 --> 30:44.050
If the Chinese start
investing in euros,

30:44.420 --> 30:46.850
and rating agencies
will lower our rating,

30:47.410 --> 30:49.410
we are finished.

30:53.660 --> 30:55.780
Thanks for warning.

31:01.200 --> 31:04.160
Why are you so calm? I am not calm.

31:04.670 --> 31:06.670
I am looking for a solution.

31:06.750 --> 31:08.750
What have you decided?

31:08.950 --> 31:11.320
We need to divert
attention from the problem.

31:11.400 --> 31:13.590
Then you need to feed the
market something serious.

31:13.680 --> 31:15.680
Yeah.

31:16.800 --> 31:18.800
What do you want to sacrifice?

31:20.480 --> 31:22.480
By Europe.

31:24.180 --> 31:28.050
The president and my boss will
not agree. They want to help Europe.

31:28.480 --> 31:31.000
The President Must
Put America Above All.

31:33.580 --> 31:36.560
If you want to divert
market attention,

31:36.640 --> 31:39.140
you should start with your own people.

31:39.610 --> 31:41.610
I was informed.

31:41.930 --> 31:45.260
Some of yours are shorting
the US Treasury now.

31:46.560 --> 31:48.600
Some of them already sensed blood.

31:55.990 --> 32:00.030
So, this is for you. When Tokyo opens,
the Treasury is short on.

32:00.120 --> 32:02.250
Yeah. - Get them. The beauty!

32:02.340 --> 32:05.100
Would already be
sooner. So great! Very well.

32:05.180 --> 32:07.180
Very well. Yeah.

32:08.930 --> 32:12.140
Sometimes I forget that you
are Italian. Do not leave us?

32:12.390 --> 32:14.390
Of course.

32:20.300 --> 32:23.550
Father, I'm sure you're
proud. You have achieved a lot.

32:23.640 --> 32:26.170
We haven’t talked for ten years,
I don’t know.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.390
I was told you are shorting
the US government debt.

32:31.050 --> 32:33.050
He didn’t know that
they were watching me.

32:33.520 --> 32:35.520
I did not give directions.

32:35.650 --> 32:37.910
I do what you taught me:

32:38.190 --> 32:40.910
I feel the blood, attack the
weakest and rip off the jackpot.

32:41.010 --> 32:43.440
And now the weakest beast is the USA.

32:44.080 --> 32:48.600
Come back and block the shorts.

32:48.680 --> 32:53.030
What is it? Holding on to a
US public debt is patriotism or...

32:53.420 --> 32:58.360
The Federal Reserve will print the money. US
debt will be closed. The end of the story.

33:00.040 --> 33:02.590
They are drowning because
they are going to print more.

33:02.760 --> 33:06.610
The dollar will not stand, and then
the US credit rating will be lowered.

33:06.700 --> 33:08.700
We are not talking
about any currency there.

33:08.840 --> 33:11.610
The US dollar will again
become a "safe haven."

33:13.870 --> 33:16.240
He is untouchable. I
do not believe in dogma.

33:16.320 --> 33:18.340
And I do not believe
that you forgot your place.

33:24.710 --> 33:27.340
Yes? Yes I.

33:31.270 --> 33:33.270
Yes.

33:43.280 --> 33:46.290
Hm. Thank you for reporting in person.

33:48.200 --> 33:50.200
Things are good?

33:50.540 --> 33:52.540
Afghanistan.

33:56.380 --> 33:58.380
John's platoon was ambushed.

34:05.120 --> 34:07.120
He died.

34:32.090 --> 34:34.090
Alex checked, Nina was not here.

34:39.520 --> 34:41.520
No, it was.

34:43.239 --> 34:45.239
Forget-me-nots.

34:46.750 --> 34:48.750
Her beloved.

34:50.120 --> 34:52.120
Brings them every year.

34:55.440 --> 34:57.450
I have an idea. Which one?

34:57.860 --> 34:59.860
Your cottage.

35:00.910 --> 35:03.210
Yes. We have not been
there for a long time.

35:03.290 --> 35:05.450
I once drove Nina there. Check it out.

35:12.960 --> 35:15.080
Aunt Nina, why did we come here?

36:12.780 --> 36:14.780
Nina?

36:17.050 --> 36:19.050
Come down.

36:20.010 --> 36:22.430
We will have breakfast, take a walk.

36:25.140 --> 36:27.200
John would not want
to... Don't even start.

36:29.150 --> 36:31.250
You didn't care about John’s wishes.

36:33.630 --> 36:35.630
Do you know why he joined the army?

36:36.230 --> 36:39.930
Because of the eleventh of September.
He wanted to somehow help his country,

36:40.310 --> 36:42.380
like any kid at his age.

36:42.460 --> 36:45.160
You heard the sons of powerful people

36:46.160 --> 36:48.160
killed in an ambush?

36:49.160 --> 36:51.160
At least once?

36:51.280 --> 36:53.740
And I'm even more proud of my son.

36:56.670 --> 36:59.630
It seemed to him that he
was not good enough for you.

37:02.940 --> 37:06.030
John saw how you behave
with those whom you admire.

37:07.240 --> 37:09.240
He saw you with Massimo.

37:13.230 --> 37:15.230
I go to work.

37:32.630 --> 37:38.000
Massimo This is Nina.
Could you pick me up?

37:38.150 --> 37:40.650
I need to go somewhere,
I can’t stay alone.

37:59.470 --> 38:02.520
Nothing is visible from here,
we have to rise higher

38:02.600 --> 38:05.830
to see the kids. Come on!

38:12.160 --> 38:14.500
Here! You see?

38:18.840 --> 38:22.460
Mothers come here to give
birth to protect the babies.

38:23.410 --> 38:26.110
They float very far,
risking their lives.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.910
This is what mothers do.

38:38.230 --> 38:42.160
I always brought John
here for his birthday.

38:43.130 --> 38:46.520
And every time he was afraid
that the seals would not be here.

38:48.340 --> 38:52.570
But then he saw the
cubs and was so happy!

38:58.830 --> 39:01.630
When I close my eyes,
I still hear his laughter.

39:09.100 --> 39:11.100
Well, let's go.

40:30.340 --> 40:34.210
Welcome back. You look better.

40:34.830 --> 40:36.830
You were right, as always.

40:38.090 --> 40:41.240
I needed to ventilate. In
the city I met Massimo.

40:41.320 --> 40:43.320
Yes? Where did they go?

40:43.400 --> 40:46.230
In Chelsea, my favorite
restaurant. And then we took a walk.

40:55.060 --> 40:57.060
We are having a hard time.

41:01.350 --> 41:04.400
Thank. It's my
pleasure. Till tomorrow.

42:12.840 --> 42:14.930
Seals are so cool! Yeah.

42:15.250 --> 42:17.320
Uncle Dominic, look what we found!

42:17.540 --> 42:19.540
And we also saw cats!

42:31.430 --> 42:33.430
I tried.

42:36.140 --> 42:38.490
When John volunteered for Afghanistan,

42:40.770 --> 42:44.380
I called the Minister of Defense
to be transferred to a safe post.

42:46.700 --> 42:50.010
I'm not a cracker,
no matter what Nina thinks.

42:51.420 --> 42:54.760
But John found out,
and forbade him to intervene.

42:56.980 --> 42:58.980
Why didn't you tell her?

43:00.010 --> 43:02.590
She thinks you weren't
trying to help. I know.

43:03.780 --> 43:05.780
But she needed to blame someone.

43:07.270 --> 43:09.270
Like all of us.

43:12.800 --> 43:18.380
Try this one. Let's throw it
together? Three two one! Yes!

43:21.930 --> 43:25.910
Why didn’t you pick up the phone?
Claire almost called the police.

43:26.010 --> 43:30.100
Sorry. I think I just wanted to
hear children's laughter again.

43:30.990 --> 43:32.990
Have you heard?

43:35.010 --> 43:37.010
Yes.

43:38.370 --> 43:40.370
But he was different.

43:46.270 --> 43:48.270
I finally reconciled...

43:52.690 --> 43:54.690
that I will never hear John again.

44:04.190 --> 44:06.540
When he was little,
we were so happy here.

44:12.700 --> 44:14.700
Yes, we were.

45:11.360 --> 45:14.930
Thank. She immediately fell asleep.

45:15.300 --> 45:18.340
For the first time in so many years,
she fell asleep without sleeping pills.

45:18.530 --> 45:21.820
No. Stay with me.

45:33.370 --> 45:35.370
Do you know what Nina blamed me for?

45:37.270 --> 45:39.680
I was more proud of you than John.

45:40.400 --> 45:42.400
It's true.

45:42.650 --> 45:46.410
I wish John was like you.

45:48.090 --> 45:50.310
Despite the fact that you fuck Nina.

45:53.880 --> 45:55.880
Thought I won’t recognize?

45:58.960 --> 46:01.180
Our relationship with
her is more than sex.

46:02.740 --> 46:05.990
She needed you. We needed you.

46:06.230 --> 46:10.200
Oddly enough,
but you saved our marriage.

46:11.230 --> 46:13.230
And you destroyed mine.

46:16.900 --> 46:19.580
Why didn't you say you
knew Carrie was in America?

46:20.520 --> 46:23.860
That she was sitting.
You hired a lawyer... Hmm.

46:24.930 --> 46:29.600
Paid him for surveillance. What for?

46:30.100 --> 46:33.950
I hired Truvor to protect
you from this crazy...

46:34.040 --> 46:36.321
I don't need your protection. Come on,
Massimo. You knew,

46:36.400 --> 46:39.080
that Carrie will ruin your career,
otherwise you would not part.

46:41.900 --> 46:43.970
I remember the
expression on your face.

46:44.050 --> 46:46.570
You didn’t just want to become
the head of the department,

46:46.650 --> 46:50.240
you wanted to be one of us,
at all costs.

46:52.320 --> 46:55.980
There is nothing to be ashamed of your
ambitions. That's why I chose you.

46:56.540 --> 46:58.900
But betrayal? No.

47:00.370 --> 47:04.170
This is not forgiven. I know
about the fraud with VAR.

47:04.990 --> 47:06.990
And I have evidence.

47:13.150 --> 47:17.690
So that? Are you firing me?

47:20.340 --> 47:22.340
You will pay for it.

47:40.610 --> 47:46.580
They say Lucifer,
the most radiant of angels,

47:53.450 --> 47:55.450
was a favorite of god.

48:00.110 --> 48:02.970
And God loved him
more than other angels.

48:07.740 --> 48:11.250
But when he found out that
Lucifer had violated his rules,

48:14.290 --> 48:16.290
God did not know mercy.

48:19.030 --> 48:21.770
With all his host of demons

48:22.810 --> 48:24.810
he cast Lucifer to hell.
