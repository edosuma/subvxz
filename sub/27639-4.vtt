-Just the gum.

00:02.837 --> 00:04.379
-Are you sure?

We have a big special

-Mmm.

00:07.842 --> 00:09.217
Can you scissor do this?

00:10.135 --> 00:12.011
Yeah, they're scissors.

00:12.053 --> 00:13.347
How about, uh, this?

00:15.098 --> 00:17.058
Not really a banana guy.

00:17.100 --> 00:18.519
But, uh... that's not all.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.771
Say you is hungry

00:18.560 --> 00:20.771
for candy bar,

00:20.813 --> 00:22.564
but not whole candy bar.

00:22.606 --> 00:24.441
Been there.

00:24.483 --> 00:27.277
Hmm? And what goes good

00:24.483 --> 00:27.277
with a candy bar?

00:27.862 --> 00:29.029
Can of pop.

00:31.490 --> 00:33.074
But you ruined your scissors.

00:33.116 --> 00:34.660
Remember banana from before?

00:34.702 --> 00:35.870
Kind of.

00:37.746 --> 00:39.080
-Still sharp.

00:37.746 --> 00:39.080
-Mmm.

00:39.122 --> 00:41.124
-I'll take 'em.

00:39.122 --> 00:41.124
-Okay. [chuckles]

-What you doing?

00:44.127 --> 00:46.087
-Selling scissor.

00:46.129 --> 00:47.548
That's, uh, six pair today.

00:47.589 --> 00:50.634
Why so many half banana,

00:47.589 --> 00:50.634

00:50.676 --> 00:53.136

Why didn't you just go?

01:35.470 --> 01:38.139
Good one, Jung.

01:35.470 --> 01:38.139
Why don't I just

01:35.470 --> 01:38.139
hand you my job?

-Who wants to grab a drink?

01:38.181 --> 01:40.141
-[Jung] I'm down. Let's do it.

01:40.183 --> 01:42.310

01:46.941 --> 01:48.149
-Peace!

01:48.191 --> 01:50.318
Well, guess,

01:48.191 --> 01:50.318
I should head out, too.

still do readings?

It just makes it longer

04:58.006 --> 05:00.341

-Pastor Nina.

05:04.679 --> 05:06.765
comfortable doing the reading,

05:06.807 --> 05:08.308
we can always ask someone else.

05:09.143 --> 05:10.811
No, of course I do.

05:10.852 --> 05:13.396
-Unless someone else

05:10.852 --> 05:13.396
wants to do it more.

05:10.852 --> 05:13.396
-Nope.

05:13.438 --> 05:14.355
I will be there.

05:14.397 --> 05:16.357
Oh, I'm glad.

05:16.399 --> 05:18.568

05:16.399 --> 05:18.568
I can get up there are

babies being baptized,

05:18.610 --> 05:20.320

05:45.012 --> 05:47.430
Okay, I should go.

Oh. Sorry for the call.

06:59.502 --> 07:01.213
Free. No catch.

07:01.255 --> 07:02.797
Cool. And just so you know,

07:02.839 --> 07:06.009
my offer still stands

07:02.839 --> 07:06.009
if you ever want to work out.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.594
With the neighborhood

07:06.051 --> 07:07.594
discount, of course.

07:07.635 --> 07:09.470
Yeah! Could be fun, huh?

07:09.512 --> 07:12.766
Jump on a thing,

07:09.512 --> 07:12.766
shake a rope, fall off a ball.

07:12.807 --> 07:15.060
Let me grab you a form,

07:12.807 --> 07:15.060
and you could think about it.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.477
Very generous, Daniel, huh?

07:16.519 --> 07:19.898
Almost as nice as me

07:16.519 --> 07:19.898
bringing you a tomato can.

07:22.943 --> 07:26.446
[muttering]

07:27.822 --> 07:29.116
So...

07:31.534 --> 07:34.495
Our monthly fee is $80,

07:31.534 --> 07:34.495
but I could charge you $45,

07:34.537 --> 07:36.957
which doesn't include

07:34.537 --> 07:36.957
a 13% HST.

07:36.998 --> 07:39.418
So, the total would be

07:36.998 --> 07:39.418
around $50 a month,

07:39.459 --> 07:42.462
or you could pay all at once,

07:39.459 --> 07:42.462
$500 for 12 months.

07:42.503 --> 07:43.755
It's $100 savings.

07:45.299 --> 07:46.425
You good?

07:46.466 --> 07:48.302
Just, uh, think about.

07:48.343 --> 07:50.553
Okay. Well, if you have any

07:48.343 --> 07:50.553
questions, I'm here 24/7, 365.

07:50.595 --> 07:51.721
Shh.

07:51.763 --> 07:53.848
-Same deal goes for Mrs...

07:51.763 --> 07:53.848
-Shh.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.350
-Hey, you forgot the...

07:53.890 --> 07:55.350
-Shh!

07:58.686 --> 08:00.021
Hey.

08:00.063 --> 08:01.564
So, last night was fun.

08:01.606 --> 08:04.943
Yeah! Sorry about Katie.

08:01.606 --> 08:04.943
She's great,

08:01.606 --> 08:04.943
but she can be a blabber.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.653
Remind you of anyone? Guilty!

08:06.694 --> 08:08.488
So, what's up?

08:08.529 --> 08:10.949
Well, I was, A,

08:08.529 --> 08:10.949
just dropping by,

08:10.991 --> 08:14.535
and B, seeing if maybe you

08:10.991 --> 08:14.535
would give me Katie's number?

08:14.577 --> 08:17.080
Oh. To... call her?

08:17.580 --> 08:18.915
Mmm-hmm. Hmm.

08:18.957 --> 08:21.793
I cannot think of a reason

08:18.957 --> 08:21.793
that's not a great idea.

08:22.585 --> 08:24.254
-You okay?

08:22.585 --> 08:24.254
-Yeah, yeah.

08:24.296 --> 08:26.547
I'm just trying to remember

08:24.296 --> 08:26.547
Katie's rules for wingmanning.

08:26.589 --> 08:28.342
It was definitely an acronym,

08:28.383 --> 08:31.011
something about it

08:28.383 --> 08:31.011
being awkward if it's

08:28.383 --> 08:31.011
a mutual friend but, meh.

08:31.052 --> 08:32.971
-I bet it's fine.

08:31.052 --> 08:32.971
-Or maybe it's not cool?

08:33.013 --> 08:35.723
The only thing

08:33.013 --> 08:35.723
not cool about this is that

08:33.013 --> 08:35.723
it hasn't happened yet.

08:36.599 --> 08:37.976
Great.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.602
So, what do you think you guys

08:38.018 --> 08:39.602
are going to get up to?

08:39.644 --> 08:41.146
Maybe lunch or coffee.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.231
Cute. Maybe lunch and coffee.

08:43.273 --> 08:44.691
That way she'll know

08:43.273 --> 08:44.691
you're serious.

08:44.732 --> 08:47.152
Not that you need to be.

08:44.732 --> 08:47.152
Are you? Don't answer.

08:47.194 --> 08:48.320
[cell phone vibrates]

08:48.362 --> 08:50.197
Okay. Deets delivered.

08:50.238 --> 08:51.572
-Thanks.

08:50.238 --> 08:51.572
-No probbies.

08:51.614 --> 08:53.200
Gonna get you some.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.494
Okay.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.582
Oh. Hey.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.001
-Hey.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.001
-Hi.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.711
We missed you today in Ceramics.

09:04.752 --> 09:07.297
Yeah. Went to see the new film

09:04.752 --> 09:07.297
by Gretchen Oh.

09:07.339 --> 09:09.590
Oh. I thought you said you had

09:07.339 --> 09:09.590
a dentist appointment?

09:09.632 --> 09:13.470
Yeah. And I was, like,

09:09.632 --> 09:13.470
"Whatever, dentist.

09:09.632 --> 09:13.470
Make it quick."

09:14.221 --> 09:16.014
They barely even froze me.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.558
Oh, I hope you don't mind.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.558
We were looking at that.

09:18.599 --> 09:21.602
Oh. It's just a helmet,

09:18.599 --> 09:21.602
but, yeah, it's pretty cool.

09:21.644 --> 09:22.854
No, your Bible.

09:23.646 --> 09:25.606
Oh, that.

09:25.648 --> 09:28.568
Ah, yeah, it's my mom's.

09:25.648 --> 09:28.568
Forgot it was even there.

09:28.609 --> 09:31.154
So are you, like,

09:28.609 --> 09:31.154
super-religious?

09:31.196 --> 09:33.823
No, I'm not super... anything.

09:33.865 --> 09:36.617
Except hanging out

09:33.865 --> 09:36.617
and startin' trouble.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.078
Janet's doing a reading

09:36.659 --> 09:38.078
this Sunday.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.829
To keep my parents off my back.

09:39.871 --> 09:42.290
They're into the church scene.

09:39.871 --> 09:42.290
It's a Korean thing.

09:42.332 --> 09:43.750
So do you wear a robe?

09:43.791 --> 09:45.585
I wear what I want.

09:45.626 --> 09:47.170
I, uh, saw your bookmark.

09:47.212 --> 09:50.006
There's some pretty misogynist

09:47.212 --> 09:50.006
stuff in there, you know?

09:50.048 --> 09:53.218
Like, "Submit to your husband"

09:50.048 --> 09:53.218
and "Women should be silent."

09:53.260 --> 09:54.261
Classic.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.805
I mean, no thanks, history.

09:57.847 --> 10:00.975
Well, I know on the surface

09:57.847 --> 10:00.975
it's a touch "Ra-ra,

09:57.847 --> 10:00.975
no girls allowed," but...

10:01.017 --> 10:03.937
It's not Janet's fault.

10:01.017 --> 10:03.937
She's a victim

10:01.017 --> 10:03.937
of the patriarchy.

10:03.978 --> 10:05.272
Who even invited you over?

10:06.689 --> 10:08.858
Sorry! I'm just

10:06.689 --> 10:08.858
getting so riled up.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.651
But you're still reading it.

10:10.693 --> 10:16.616
Yeah. But only to point out

10:10.693 --> 10:16.616
all the faults with this

10:10.693 --> 10:16.616
chauvinistic BS.

10:16.657 --> 10:20.661
Come Sunday, the whole

10:16.657 --> 10:20.661
congregation's gonna get a real

10:16.657 --> 10:20.661
earful from the Book of Janet.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.622
Amen, sister.

10:22.663 --> 10:24.707
Or does that still

10:22.663 --> 10:24.707
lean in the wrong direction?

10:26.918 --> 10:28.211
Hey, gorgeous.

10:28.253 --> 10:29.921
Katie! What's goin' on?

10:29.963 --> 10:32.632
Just so great

10:29.963 --> 10:32.632
to see you last night.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.632
I just thought I'd pop by.

10:32.673 --> 10:35.885
Cool. I get it.

10:32.673 --> 10:35.885
So where are you guys going?

10:35.927 --> 10:37.137
What?

10:37.178 --> 10:39.013
You and Jung.

10:37.178 --> 10:39.013
He asked me for your number.

10:39.055 --> 10:40.640
He called you, didn't he?

10:40.681 --> 10:41.766
No.

10:41.808 --> 10:44.727
Oh. Coolio. Well...

10:44.769 --> 10:48.273
So, wait, when Jung

10:44.769 --> 10:48.273
asked for my number,

10:44.769 --> 10:48.273
did he seem interested?

10:48.315 --> 10:49.899
Hard to tell.

10:48.315 --> 10:49.899
He's kind of a closed book.

10:49.941 --> 10:52.110
I'm always like,

10:49.941 --> 10:52.110
"What is going on

10:49.941 --> 10:52.110
in that noggin, mister?"

10:52.152 --> 10:53.987
But he asked for my number?

10:54.028 --> 10:57.657
He did. So, I guess

10:54.028 --> 10:57.657
we got a little nugget

10:54.028 --> 10:57.657
from that noggin after all.

10:57.698 --> 10:58.699
[chuckles]

10:58.741 --> 11:00.701
Katie! What brings you to Handy?

11:00.743 --> 11:02.370
Oh, she just came by to see me.

11:02.412 --> 11:04.038
Oh, cool.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.457
So, you wanna grab lunch?

11:05.499 --> 11:07.667
Oh, I would love to,

11:05.499 --> 11:07.667
but I can't. Got a meeting.

11:07.708 --> 11:10.170
Oh. Anyone else?

11:10.753 --> 11:12.172
I'd be up for it.

11:12.213 --> 11:13.714
If that's okay?

11:13.756 --> 11:16.635
Sh-yeah. But you

11:13.756 --> 11:16.635
only get one hour, mister.

11:13.756 --> 11:16.635
Not a minute more.

11:16.675 --> 11:17.718
Or you're grounded.

11:17.760 --> 11:18.719
[women laugh]

11:18.761 --> 11:20.721
Great. We'll make plans soon.

11:20.763 --> 11:22.307
We better. Or you're grounded.

11:23.891 --> 11:25.684
Have a margarita for me.

11:25.726 --> 11:28.729
Not really. I'd have

11:25.726 --> 11:28.729
to write myself up.

11:25.726 --> 11:28.729
I'm on the job here.

11:28.771 --> 11:31.316
Unless drinking margaritas

11:28.771 --> 11:31.316
was your job.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.733
Like my aunt.

11:32.775 --> 11:33.985
Who are we talking to?

11:37.447 --> 11:38.739
Looking good.

Ah, just a normal church-style.

13:28.057 --> 13:30.769
of you first teacher?

13:30.809 --> 13:32.895
Wow! You are thorough.

13:32.937 --> 13:35.022
It was Mr. Koslowski.

13:35.064 --> 13:36.857
I remember being pretty shy--

13:36.899 --> 13:39.360
How you spell Cow-cow-ski?

13:39.902 --> 13:41.780
K-O...

13:41.820 --> 13:44.282
-Daniel. Mr. Kim!

13:41.820 --> 13:44.282
-Hey.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.493
Are you joining? Hint-hint.

13:46.534 --> 13:49.454
Okay, let's finish this later.

13:46.534 --> 13:49.454
I got a "Plank You Very Much"

13:46.534 --> 13:49.454
class in five.

13:49.496 --> 13:50.871
Okay. Sound good.

13:50.913 --> 13:52.831
-Plank you very much.

13:50.913 --> 13:52.831
-Oh.

13:52.873 --> 13:53.832
[both chuckle]

14:01.215 --> 14:03.134
[all speaking Korean]

14:03.176 --> 14:04.885
-Hi, Mrs. Lee.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.885
-Janet.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.764
I hear you're doing

14:04.927 --> 14:07.764
reading today. So wonderful.

14:07.806 --> 14:09.056
It's no big deal.

14:09.098 --> 14:10.891
You make your Umma so proud.

14:10.933 --> 14:12.893
[Gerald] Wow. Tall in here.

14:12.935 --> 14:14.395
Oh, my God.

14:14.437 --> 14:15.730
Let's sit, huh?

14:15.772 --> 14:17.064
Okay, just gotta say hi

14:15.772 --> 14:17.064
to Gerald first.

14:17.106 --> 14:18.899
Just hurry.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.901
Hey. What are you guys

14:18.941 --> 14:20.901
doing here?

14:20.943 --> 14:23.237
-Moral support.

14:20.943 --> 14:23.237
-What you're doing is so brave.

14:23.279 --> 14:26.199
Yeah, but it's kind of boring

14:23.279 --> 14:26.199
if you haven't read the book.

14:26.240 --> 14:30.453
Why don't you guys grab brunch

14:26.240 --> 14:30.453
and I'll swing by after

14:26.240 --> 14:30.453
I've bruised up "the man."

14:30.495 --> 14:33.998
No, no. Hate speech and misogyny

14:30.495 --> 14:33.998
need to be stamped out.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.249
We're here for you.

14:35.291 --> 14:36.835
[Umma] Janet!

14:36.876 --> 14:40.129
Mrs. Yoo is here all way from

14:36.876 --> 14:40.129
Mississauga to see you.

14:42.507 --> 14:43.675
Okay.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.260
It's stamping time.

14:46.302 --> 14:47.303
Uh-huh.

14:47.846 --> 14:48.888
Here.

14:51.265 --> 14:54.769
Thank you for letting me know

14:51.265 --> 14:54.769
because I didn't even know

14:51.265 --> 14:54.769
I was missing my keys.

14:54.811 --> 14:58.356
Yeah. Oh, here you go.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.817
Aren't these the keys

14:58.398 --> 15:00.817
to your cash register?

15:00.859 --> 15:02.694
-Okay. Thank you.

15:00.859 --> 15:02.694
-[clears throat]

15:02.736 --> 15:04.945
Yeah. I doing Crash-Fit sometime

15:04.987 --> 15:06.865
and I know Daniel

15:04.987 --> 15:06.865
change password,

15:06.906 --> 15:08.032
and, of course, he give to me,

15:08.074 --> 15:10.159
but, uh, I forget. Crazy.

15:10.201 --> 15:12.995
Can you, uh, remind?

15:14.080 --> 15:16.290
Oh, dear.

15:16.332 --> 15:19.502
This is a real

15:16.332 --> 15:19.502
Enrique's Choice situation.

15:19.544 --> 15:21.003
Maybe you should ask Daniel?

15:21.045 --> 15:22.922
Uh, but's he's so busy,

15:22.963 --> 15:27.009
and I think, uh,

15:22.963 --> 15:27.009
maybe I can ask you

15:22.963 --> 15:27.009
because we's so good...

15:29.637 --> 15:30.971
friend.

15:31.013 --> 15:32.973
Oh, my gee.

15:33.015 --> 15:34.975
You said it.

15:35.017 --> 15:36.770
Mr. Kim, do you know how long

15:35.017 --> 15:36.770
I've been waiting for you--

15:36.811 --> 15:38.020
Yeah. Okay. What's the password?

15:38.062 --> 15:40.189
Mr. Kim, would a true friend

15:38.062 --> 15:40.189
ask another true friend

15:40.231 --> 15:42.817
to betray his

15:40.231 --> 15:42.817
fitness wi-fi community?

15:43.526 --> 15:44.778
Yes.

15:44.819 --> 15:46.987
Maybe... for my best friend.

15:47.029 --> 15:48.364
Just a regular friend.

15:48.406 --> 15:50.533
Okay, it's

15:48.406 --> 15:50.533
BubblesthecatKoslowsky.

15:50.575 --> 15:53.994
Enrique, are you coming,

15:50.575 --> 15:53.994
'cause I got three standbys...

15:54.036 --> 15:57.206
I gave Mr. Kim

15:54.036 --> 15:57.206
the Crash-Fit wi-fi.

15:57.248 --> 16:01.210
Oh! It's like a 20-pound

15:57.248 --> 16:01.210
kettle bell has been

15:57.248 --> 16:01.210
lifted off my back.

16:01.252 --> 16:05.005
What? No! I just

16:01.252 --> 16:05.005
testing him, and he fail.

16:05.047 --> 16:06.841
You were stealing my wi-fi?

16:06.883 --> 16:10.344
Well, remember time you

16:06.883 --> 16:10.344
use my hose to wash your car?

16:10.386 --> 16:11.805
Same, same.

16:11.846 --> 16:13.973
Mr. K, I thought we were getting

16:11.846 --> 16:13.973
to know each other.

16:14.014 --> 16:15.349
Okay, okay.

16:15.391 --> 16:19.145
Tell you what, you can use

16:15.391 --> 16:19.145
my garden hose anytime you want,

16:19.186 --> 16:20.939
even every day.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.189
Don't have to ask.

16:22.231 --> 16:25.318
I have a better idea.

16:22.231 --> 16:25.318
You can have the wi-fi password.

16:25.359 --> 16:27.528
Thank you. Ah...

16:27.570 --> 16:29.405
Take any energy bar you like.

16:29.447 --> 16:31.407
If you buy

16:29.447 --> 16:31.407
a Crash-Fit membership.

16:32.366 --> 16:34.118
[sighs]

16:34.160 --> 16:38.038
Okay, well, I guess, uh,

16:34.160 --> 16:38.038
with neighbor discount,

16:38.080 --> 16:41.459
it's still cheaper

16:38.080 --> 16:41.459
than rip-off cable company.

16:41.501 --> 16:44.796
All right. I will put you

16:41.501 --> 16:44.796
on the list for

16:41.501 --> 16:44.796
the 6:00 a.m. Quad Crush.

16:45.379 --> 16:48.007
Let's go, Enrique.

16:48.048 --> 16:51.845
And our scripture today

16:48.048 --> 16:51.845
will be read by Janet Kim.

16:51.886 --> 16:53.137
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

16:53.179 --> 16:54.973
You! Yeah!

16:55.014 --> 16:56.056
[Gerald] Give 'em hell, Janet!

16:56.098 --> 16:57.350
[Dree] Whoo!

17:00.102 --> 17:01.270
[Janet clears throat]

17:03.523 --> 17:06.901
"A woman should be quiet,

17:03.523 --> 17:06.901
in full submission.

17:06.943 --> 17:10.655
Do not permit a woman

17:06.943 --> 17:10.655
to teach or assume authority

17:06.943 --> 17:10.655
over a man..."

17:12.782 --> 17:13.867
Um...

17:15.368 --> 17:18.371
Hi, I'm Janet,

17:18.412 --> 17:22.000
and, uh, personally,

17:22.041 --> 17:26.462
I'm kind of

17:22.041 --> 17:26.462
disappointed that, um,

17:26.504 --> 17:31.091
in this day and age,

17:26.504 --> 17:31.091
our church would try to silence

17:26.504 --> 17:31.091
the voice of women.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.343
-Janet...

17:31.133 --> 17:32.343
-No.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.470
I will not be silenced.

17:34.512 --> 17:38.516
Women have fought too long

17:34.512 --> 17:38.516
and too hard, but no more.

17:38.558 --> 17:39.893
Yeah, sister!

17:39.934 --> 17:43.103
And while I agree,

17:39.934 --> 17:43.103
that's not today's reading.

17:43.145 --> 17:44.063
Oh.

17:46.148 --> 17:48.401
[clears throat]

17:48.442 --> 17:50.945
-"Season your grain with salt."

17:48.442 --> 17:50.945
-No. Sorry.

17:53.531 --> 17:54.699
This one.

17:56.158 --> 17:58.202
"Love is patient, love is kind.

17:58.244 --> 18:01.873
It is not self-seeking,

17:58.244 --> 18:01.873
it is not easily angered,

18:01.915 --> 18:04.667
it keeps no record of wrongs."

18:06.502 --> 18:09.505
Really want to

18:06.502 --> 18:09.505
emphasize that last one.

18:06.502 --> 18:09.505
[chuckles nervously]

18:12.258 --> 18:14.761
[Kimchee]

18:12.258 --> 18:14.761
So I put the corporate rentals

18:12.258 --> 18:14.761
in this part of the spreadsheet,

18:14.802 --> 18:17.221
and the other rentals

18:14.802 --> 18:17.221
are under this tab.

18:17.263 --> 18:20.140
-Sorry, what?

18:17.263 --> 18:20.140
-And this is a blank column

18:17.263 --> 18:20.140
I can't delete.

18:20.182 --> 18:22.393
[Terence] Oh, and the number

18:20.182 --> 18:22.393
of damaged returns went up.

18:22.435 --> 18:25.063
Uh, fantastic. Good work.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.397
Not really.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.148
You know what?

18:26.439 --> 18:28.148
I can't work like this.

18:28.190 --> 18:29.901
I agree. I'm way too clammy.

18:29.943 --> 18:31.277
Jung, can I see you

18:29.943 --> 18:31.277
for a moment?

18:31.318 --> 18:32.403
Yeah. Sure.

18:33.195 --> 18:35.281
What's up?

18:35.322 --> 18:37.491
We're trying to get a handle on

18:35.322 --> 18:37.491
year-end and you're distracting

18:35.322 --> 18:37.491
everyone in here.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.786
[Kimchee] I really

18:37.533 --> 18:39.786
didn't even notice.

18:39.827 --> 18:43.539
And thanks to your constant

18:39.827 --> 18:43.539
snapchatting and general phone

18:39.827 --> 18:43.539
unprofessionalism, we're behind.

18:43.581 --> 18:45.165
I was just texting.

18:45.207 --> 18:46.876
That's right. Which means we're

18:45.207 --> 18:46.876
going to have to work late,

18:46.918 --> 18:48.878
and I'm sorry if that's going

18:46.918 --> 18:48.878
to spoil your date,

18:48.920 --> 18:50.379
or an intimate

18:48.920 --> 18:50.379
evening with someone.

18:50.421 --> 18:52.172
-It's not.

18:50.421 --> 18:52.172
-Good.

18:52.214 --> 18:55.175
Katie had tickets

18:52.214 --> 18:55.175
to this concert,

18:52.214 --> 18:55.175
but I'm sure she'll understand.

18:55.217 --> 18:57.762
Well, I mean, if you need

18:55.217 --> 18:57.762
to go because of that...

18:57.804 --> 18:59.179
No, you need me

18:57.804 --> 18:59.179
to stay, I'll stay.

18:59.221 --> 19:01.140
Fine, if you want to stay.

19:02.558 --> 19:05.185
Did you want me to stay?

19:05.227 --> 19:07.313
Also, my mom really needs

19:05.227 --> 19:07.313
a fourth for bridge.

19:08.397 --> 19:09.565
Not tonight, T-bag.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.235
[indistinct chatter]

19:13.277 --> 19:15.154
What's the matter

19:13.277 --> 19:15.154
with you, Janet?

19:15.195 --> 19:17.197
You embarrass me in front

19:15.195 --> 19:17.197
of whole church.

19:17.239 --> 19:19.199
You gave me

19:17.239 --> 19:19.199
the wrong passage, Umma.

19:19.241 --> 19:21.744
What was I supposed to do?

19:19.241 --> 19:21.744
Just go along with something

19:19.241 --> 19:21.744
I have issues with?

19:21.786 --> 19:23.121
Yeah.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.998
I have issue

19:23.162 --> 19:24.998
with lots of thing.

19:25.039 --> 19:27.625
Sometime just have

19:25.039 --> 19:27.625
to go along.

19:27.667 --> 19:30.086
Maybe it's time you

19:27.667 --> 19:30.086
stopped going along.

19:32.713 --> 19:36.175
Umma, I didn't mean

19:32.713 --> 19:36.175
to embarrass you.

19:36.216 --> 19:38.218
I'm sorry.

19:38.260 --> 19:42.849
I didn't mean to give you wrong

19:38.260 --> 19:42.849
passage. I'm sorry, too.

19:42.890 --> 19:45.392
-But seriously, Umma--

19:42.890 --> 19:45.392
-Don't ruin moment, Janet.

19:45.434 --> 19:48.270
Thank you. So much.

19:45.434 --> 19:48.270
You did a lovely job.

19:48.312 --> 19:50.023
You don't have to say that.

19:50.064 --> 19:51.858
Yeah, she do. She's a pastor.

19:51.899 --> 19:54.568
If nothing else, it gave us

19:51.899 --> 19:54.568
an important teaching less...

19:54.610 --> 19:56.445
Oh my God. Young people.

19:56.487 --> 19:57.697
Please don't leave!

20:02.118 --> 20:04.453
Wow! We did not rent

20:02.118 --> 20:04.453
as many cars as we thought.

20:04.495 --> 20:07.081
No wonder we took

20:04.495 --> 20:07.081
over this dud branch.

20:04.495 --> 20:07.081
No offence, Stacie.

20:07.123 --> 20:08.875
It has gone up

20:07.123 --> 20:08.875
in the last month.

20:08.916 --> 20:11.251
And who's been working here

20:08.916 --> 20:11.251
a month? You're welcome.

20:11.293 --> 20:13.671
So, what are we thinking?

20:11.293 --> 20:13.671
Thai, burgers, Indian?

20:13.713 --> 20:15.089
They all look good.

20:15.131 --> 20:16.799
Actually, I think we're done.

20:16.841 --> 20:18.509
-See ya.

20:16.841 --> 20:18.509
-And bridge is out.

20:18.551 --> 20:21.428
My mom partnered with my sister,

20:18.551 --> 20:21.428
Miss Coup en passant.

20:21.470 --> 20:22.763
[Kimchee] Who's up for a beer?

20:22.805 --> 20:24.640
I'm already missing the concert.

20:24.682 --> 20:27.267
Oh, you guys should go.

20:27.309 --> 20:28.811
-You sure?

20:27.309 --> 20:28.811
-Yeah.

20:28.853 --> 20:31.271
We're buds, but might be

20:28.853 --> 20:31.271
good to keep it profesh.

20:31.313 --> 20:33.273
-As long as someone's

20:31.313 --> 20:33.273
buying me a beer.

20:31.313 --> 20:33.273
-I'm not.

20:33.315 --> 20:35.275

20:41.157 --> 20:43.951
I guess it is less distracting

20:41.157 --> 20:43.951
without the subtitles.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.586
Okay, now I see

20:51.333 --> 20:53.586

20:54.336 --> 20:56.296
She's going to talk

20:54.336 --> 20:56.296
through the whole thing?

20:56.338 --> 20:59.675
I only invited her to be polite.

20:59.717 --> 21:00.467
What's that?

21:00.509 --> 21:01.510
So good, huh?

21:01.552 --> 21:02.887
It's very exciting.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.764
So who is the man

21:02.929 --> 21:04.764

-You not even sweating.

21:09.018 --> 21:11.270
-Shh!

21:12.855 --> 21:14.107
Why did you invite her?

21:14.398 --> 21:17.151
We're all wondering the same

21:14.398 --> 21:17.151
