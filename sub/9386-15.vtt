he may better himself.

Actually, I'm Douglas Brackman

Brian, I read your article
in the Daily Shopper.

02:12.508 --> 02:14.927
-It was wonderful.
-Don't oversell it, Lois.

02:15.010 --> 02:16.428
No, it was good.

02:16.512 --> 02:19.223
It almost felt like it was written
by a real writer.

02:19.306 --> 02:20.974
I read your article, too, Brian.

02:21.058 --> 02:23.268
It seems to me you should spend less time
working for the paper

02:23.352 --> 02:25.771
and more time working on that novel
you've been working on.
