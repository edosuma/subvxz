Dearest Lehzen,
someone has to run my household,

07:25.520 --> 07:27.600
the way I would like it.

07:35.760 --> 07:37.400
<font color="#ffff00">The Queen wants all her things</font>

07:37.440 --> 07:39.280
<font color="#ffff00">moved into the blue state room</font>
<font color="#ffff00">tonight.</font>

07:39.320 --> 07:41.440
<font color="#ffff00">She will be sleeping there</font>
<font color="#ffff00">from now on.</font>

07:43.920 --> 07:46.560
<font color="#00ffff">I will have to talk to Sir John</font>
<font color="#00ffff">about that.</font>

07:49.640 --> 07:51.160
<font color="#ffff00">No, Mr Penge, you will not.</font>

07:51.200 --> 07:54.480
The Queen has put me in charge
of the Royal Household.

07:55.520 --> 07:57.720
I congratulate you, Baroness.

07:58.720 --> 08:00.160
<font color="#ffff00">I warn you, Mr Penge.</font>

08:01.280 --> 08:05.320
I intend to run this household
according to modern principles of
economy.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.320
I will want to see all the accounts,

08:07.360 --> 08:10.720
and that includes the Dressers'
Book, Mrs Jenkins.

08:11.760 --> 08:14.200
<font color="#ffff00">I will have no patience with</font>
<font color="#ffff00">extravagance.</font>

08:20.120 --> 08:23.360
<font color="#00ffff">So now we are answerable to a</font>

08:23.400 --> 08:25.440
And a German one at that!

08:25.480 --> 08:27.120
<font color="#00ffff">God save the Queen.</font>

08:27.160 --> 08:29.200

<font color="#00ff00">a moment of your time.</font>

<font color="#00ff00">The Queen has led</font>
<font color="#00ff00">the most sheltered life until now</font>

08:49.040 --> 08:52.200
<font color="#00ff00">and her mother is concerned</font>
<font color="#00ff00">that she should not be overburdened.</font>

08:57.400 --> 08:59.600
<font color="#00ff00">As her mother's trusted advisor,</font>

08:59.640 --> 09:02.880

<font color="#00ff00">private secretary,</font>

09:02.920 --> 09:06.880
<font color="#00ff00">you could be sure that your</font>

09:07.720 --> 09:10.920
<font color="#ffff00">Well, thank you, Sir John.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I shall bear that in mind.</font>

09:14.240 --> 09:15.800
<font color="#ffff00">Lord Melbourne is here.</font>

09:15.840 --> 09:18.840
Perhaps I should stay as chaperone.

09:18.880 --> 09:21.760
No, a monarch always meets the prime
minister alone.

09:21.800 --> 09:24.160
<font color="#ffff00">Drina, I mean, Majesty...</font>

09:26.320 --> 09:28.840
<font color="#ffff00">..I have always tried to shield you</font>
<font color="#ffff00">from these things,</font>

09:28.880 --> 09:31.280
but Lord Melbourne, I'm afraid, is
disreputable!

09:31.320 --> 09:34.240
Nevertheless, I will meet him alone.

09:46.440 --> 09:47.920
<font color="#ffff00">You may go in now.</font>

10:03.120 --> 10:06.920
<font color="#ffff00">May I offer you my condolences</font>
<font color="#ffff00">on the death of your uncle, Your</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Majesty.</font>

10:06.960 --> 10:08.840
He was always kind to me.

10:10.760 --> 10:13.760
Though he did have some strange
ideas about who I should marry.

10:15.360 --> 10:17.440
<font color="#ffff00">I believe he favoured the Prince</font>
<font color="#ffff00">of Orange.</font>

10:17.480 --> 10:19.480
A prince with a head
the size of a pumpkin.

10:20.760 --> 10:23.080
I see you have a keen eye for
detail, Ma'am.

10:27.560 --> 10:28.920
<font color="#ffff00">May I?</font>

10:33.120 --> 10:35.800
<font color="#ffff00">What's her name?</font>
<font color="#ffffff">She doesn't have a name.</font>

10:36.840 --> 10:38.520
She's number 123.

10:39.520 --> 10:41.880
My mother gave her to me
on my 11th birthday.

10:42.840 --> 10:45.000
<font color="#ffff00">With the crown?</font>
<font color="#ffffff">That came later.</font>

10:46.120 --> 10:48.880
I made it for her on the day I
realised I would be queen.

10:52.320 --> 10:54.000
<font color="#ffff00">When was that?</font>

10:55.920 --> 10:57.280
I was 13.

10:58.440 --> 11:02.480
I was having a history lesson with
Lehzen. She showed me the family tree

11:02.520 --> 11:04.560
and I looked at it for a long time.

11:05.720 --> 11:08.080
And then I realised I was next.

11:08.120 --> 11:10.080
<font color="#ffff00">Were you pleased?</font>

11:10.120 --> 11:13.080
I remember thinking my uncle's crown
would be too big for me.

11:18.360 --> 11:22.040
I believe you are acquainted with
my mother's advisor,
Sir John Conroy.

11:22.080 --> 11:27.440
<font color="#ffff00">I have met him, Ma'am. I would not</font>
<font color="#ffff00">say we were acquaintances.</font>

11:28.400 --> 11:30.600
<font color="#ffff00">He would like to be your private</font>
<font color="#ffff00">secretary.</font>

11:30.640 --> 11:32.520
That is out of the question.

11:34.560 --> 11:38.160
<font color="#ffff00">I see. </font><font color="#ffffff"> He means to run me, as he</font>
runs my mother.

11:38.920 --> 11:40.680

<font color="#ffff00">else.</font>

11:43.280 --> 11:45.720
<font color="#ffff00">Perhaps I might act for you.</font>

11:45.760 --> 11:48.560
There's a great deal of business
that needs to be attended to.

11:48.600 --> 11:51.200

<font color="#ffff00">already on their way to you</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Tomorrow is the Privy Council.</font>

11:55.000 --> 11:59.320
Thank you, Lord Melbourne,
but when I require assistance,
I will ask for it.

16:46.120 --> 16:48.720
But the senior dresser always
chooses her own assistants.

16:48.760 --> 16:51.680
I've already made enquiries.
<font color="#ffff00">I've saved you the trouble.</font>

16:51.720 --> 16:54.840
<font color="#ffff00">Miss Skerrett was a pupil</font>

by the principal.

16:57.360 --> 17:01.160
<font color="#00ffff">I'm sure Mrs Jenkins</font>
<font color="#00ffff">will be very grateful for the help.</font>

17:05.440 --> 17:07.560
Highly recommended, is it?

17:07.599 --> 17:10.599
Aren't we the lucky ones? What is it
they taught you there, hm?

17:10.640 --> 17:13.960
Astronomy? The pianoforte? French?

17:14.000 --> 17:16.800
<font color="#00ffff">Some French, ma'am,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">but mostly needlework,</font>

17:16.839 --> 17:19.200
<font color="#00ffff">and how to make myself useful.</font>

17:19.240 --> 17:22.599
At least you're English.
There's enough Germans at the palace.

I do not need your assistance.
Thank you.

I'd have been better prepared

18:28.800 --> 18:30.840
if you'd allowed me
to go out into society

at Kensington all the time.

18:35.080 --> 18:36.880
I know my duty is to serve my

18:38.000 --> 18:40.520
Mama, you know I'm ready.

I think you forget.

Although I am young, and perhaps
ignorant...

19:14.760 --> 19:16.960
..I am my father's daughter...

19:18.200 --> 19:19.920
..the granddaughter of a king,

19:19.960 --> 19:21.680
and I believe I shall find my own

19:21.720 --> 19:24.080
And if I require advice,
I will ask for it.

No, Mama. He has always been your

19:58.400 --> 20:02.000
I'm surprised they didn't teach you
how to do this at your institute.

20:18.680 --> 20:20.880
Would you like me to see
what I can do with these?

20:20.920 --> 20:24.680
Oh, the Queen won't wear mended
gloves, she has a fresh pair every
time she goes out.

20:24.720 --> 20:29.200
But she does wear mended stockings,
so you can show me how clever you
are with those.

Flora Hastings actually came into my

20:43.520 --> 20:45.840
She's Mama's lady-in-waiting, not
mine.

And that man was in the library

Oh, I think this will do quite well.

23:53.160 --> 23:57.960
<font color="#ffff00">Yes. I think before your first</font>
<font color="#ffff00">levee, we should probably try to</font>
<font color="#ffff00">find a throne that fits.</font>

23:58.000 --> 24:01.600
It is hard to be dignified
when your feet are six inches
from the floor.

24:04.360 --> 24:08.960
You see, I don't understand why this
place is called a house not a palace.

24:09.920 --> 24:12.240
<font color="#ffff00">Well, you can call it whatever you</font>
<font color="#ffff00">like, Ma'am.</font>

<font color="#00ff00">You could get lost in here.</font>

24:15.800 --> 24:19.680
This is what I call a royal
residence.

24:31.680 --> 24:34.400
She is small.
But she ain't no midget.

24:34.440 --> 24:37.120
<font color="#00ff00">No. Everything is in proportion.</font>

24:39.840 --> 24:42.680
At least here I'll be completely
separate from Mama.

I cannot have Sir John
hovering about me all the time.

24:46.480 --> 24:50.760
<font color="#ffff00">I believe the Duchess</font>
<font color="#ffff00">relies on Conroy a good deal.</font>

24:50.800 --> 24:53.360
He's been handling her affairs for
some time.

24:53.400 --> 24:56.080
They all think because I'm small
that I'm still a child.

24:56.120 --> 24:59.040
They've always underestimated me.
They expect me to fail.

25:01.840 --> 25:04.280
They don't believe me capable of
being Queen.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.280
<font color="#ffff00">I think they're mistaken, Ma'am.</font>

25:08.760 --> 25:11.080

<font color="#ffff00">on your stature</font>

25:11.120 --> 25:13.080
<font color="#ffff00">should be sent</font>
<font color="#ffff00">straight to the Tower.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Ma'am,</font>

25:15.520 --> 25:19.720
<font color="#ffff00">but I'm confident that you will</font>
<font color="#ffff00">bring great credit to the monarchy.</font>

25:19.760 --> 25:22.440
<font color="#ffff00">It's true your education may be</font>
<font color="#ffff00">lacking in some areas,</font>

25:22.480 --> 25:25.200
but you have a natural dignity
that cannot be learnt.

25:25.920 --> 25:28.240
You don't think I'm too short to be
dignified?

25:28.280 --> 25:31.480
<font color="#ffff00">To me, Ma'am, you are every inch a</font>
<font color="#ffff00">queen.</font>

25:34.360 --> 25:36.520
Lord Melbourne, when we first met,

25:36.560 --> 25:39.240
you offered to act as
my private secretary.

Please allow me to serve you in any

Mama always made me wear it like
hers, a l'Anglaise, but...

28:46.120 --> 28:48.520
I would like something
more au courant.

28:49.640 --> 28:53.520
<font color="#00ffff">Au courant, Ma'am?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I am not familiar with that style.</font>

28:53.560 --> 28:55.560
(CHUCKLES)
Oh, no, it's not a hairstyle.

28:55.600 --> 28:58.080
Au courant means fashionable
in French.

28:58.120 --> 29:00.440
I'm inspecting the troops tomorrow

29:00.480 --> 29:03.640
and there'll be so many ladies
of fashion there.

29:04.520 --> 29:06.520
<font color="#00ffff">Perhaps a pendant braid</font>
<font color="#00ffff">around each ear?</font>

29:06.560 --> 29:08.600
<font color="#00ffff">It's a style that suits a face</font>
<font color="#00ffff">like yours.</font>

29:10.000 --> 29:11.920
<font color="#00ffff">It is very au courant at the moment.</font>

29:11.960 --> 29:13.640
<font color="#00ff00">Do you think that's wise, Ma'am?</font>

29:13.680 --> 29:15.920
<font color="#00ff00">Miss Skerrett has not done your hair</font>
<font color="#00ff00">before.</font>

29:15.960 --> 29:17.800
<font color="#00ff00">She might not do it to your liking.</font>

29:17.840 --> 29:22.560
Well, if she does my hair half as
well as she has done her own,
I will be quite satisfied.

30:28.600 --> 30:32.040

<font color="#00ffff">I'm sure it was a mistake but,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">according to precedent,</font>

30:36.080 --> 30:38.680
if a sovereign turns their back on a

30:38.720 --> 30:41.760
they will no longer form
part of the household cavalry.

But no-one mentioned it to me.
<font color="#00ffff">I assure you they noticed.</font>

30:49.840 --> 30:53.240
But no one likes to correct their
monarch, Ma'am.

30:53.280 --> 30:56.440
Except for you, evidently.
<font color="#00ffff">I feel it is my duty.</font>

30:57.600 --> 31:01.600
<font color="#00ffff">There are many things that the</font>

31:11.120 --> 31:13.520
I have an excellent tutor

And, as you know, the Duke is in the

31:27.960 --> 31:30.440
She looks very elegant. Is she
respectable?

31:51.520 --> 31:54.240
That must explain why I love dancing
so much.

31:54.280 --> 31:57.120
Of course there can be no dancing
until the coronation.

<font color="#ffff00">I fear you've been waiting for me.</font>

32:23.680 --> 32:25.360
The Duchess is concerned...

32:26.360 --> 32:28.440
..about the appointment of the
Queen's ladies.

32:28.480 --> 32:30.120
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, I believe it's the first time</font>

<font color="#00ffff">So you have chosen her</font>

32:42.120 --> 32:44.200
Harriet Sutherland is charming.

32:44.240 --> 32:46.640

<font color="#ffff00">Yes?</font>

34:12.760 --> 34:15.600
She thinks I should not always be
guided by you.

34:17.199 --> 34:18.960
<font color="#ffff00">Perhaps she's right.</font>

34:19.000 --> 34:22.960
What do you mean?
<font color="#ffff00">I should not be your only advisor.</font>

again, Lord M.

34:51.800 --> 34:57.560
She was not a...model wife by any
means, but she was enough for me.

34:58.680 --> 35:00.800
You did not mind she ran away
with Lord Byron?

35:02.720 --> 35:04.080
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, I minded.</font>

35:05.720 --> 35:07.640
But you did not disown her?

35:09.520 --> 35:11.920
I think I would find such behaviour
hard to forgive.

35:15.800 --> 35:18.080

But then, ever since I can remember,

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:34.120
