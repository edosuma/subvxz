WEBVTT

00:05.506 --> 00:06.777
YOU ARE.

00:06.777 --> 00:08.739
YOU´RE THE MOST POWERFUL
MAN IN THE WORLD,

00:08.739 --> 00:10.341
AND I HAVE BEEN NAUGHTY.

00:10.341 --> 00:12.213
BUT I´M IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING, OKAY?

00:12.213 --> 00:14.345
ANGIE, I´M TALKING
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT

00:14.345 --> 00:15.746
OF THE UNITED STATES --

00:15.746 --> 00:18.689
GEORGE W. BUSH IS GIVING
A SPEECH AT THE FACTORY.

00:18.689 --> 00:20.591
I´M MEETING
THE PRESIDENT, ANGIE!

00:20.591 --> 00:22.493
OH, MY GOD.

00:22.493 --> 00:24.625
WHY IS HE COMING
TO POWERS AVIATION?

00:24.625 --> 00:26.727
HE´S CAMPAIGNING
FOR MORE DEFENSE SPENDING.

00:26.727 --> 00:29.029
AND HALF THE FACTORY´S
LATINO.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.501
WE´RE DESIRABLE NOW.

00:30.501 --> 00:34.235
MOM, ONE DAY WE´LL PUT
A LATINO IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

00:34.235 --> 00:38.069
IT´LL STILL BE WHITE
BUT WITH, LIKE, BLUE TRIM.

00:38.069 --> 00:40.141
LITTLE CERAMIC DUCKS
IN THE FRONT YARD.

00:40.141 --> 00:43.314
YEAH, AND EVERY MORNING,
THE PRESIDENT WILL DROP BY

00:43.314 --> 00:46.077
THE PAINT STORE AND PICK UP
HIS SECRETARY OF STATE...

00:46.077 --> 00:48.119
CHATO.

00:48.119 --> 00:51.352
THIS IS SO EXCITING.
I CAN´T WAIT!

00:51.352 --> 00:53.684
I´M GOING TO MEET THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.

00:53.684 --> 00:56.257
NO, NO, NO, THIS IS
JUST FOR US WORKERS.

00:56.257 --> 00:58.289
THERE´S SOME BAD NEWS, TOO.

00:58.289 --> 01:00.331
SINCE I´LL BE ON CAMERA
BEHIND THE PRESIDENT,

01:00.331 --> 01:02.463
THE POWERS BROTHERS WANT ME
TO LOOK MORE RESPECTABLE.

01:02.463 --> 01:05.236
THEY´RE MAKING ME
CUT MY HAIR.

01:05.236 --> 01:06.837
OH, NO.

01:06.837 --> 01:09.600
WHAT AM I GOING
TO HOLD ONTO?

01:09.600 --> 01:13.204
NOT MY LUNCH.

01:13.204 --> 01:15.206
FOR 15 YEARS, I HAD
TO KEEP MY HAIR SHORT

01:15.206 --> 01:17.848
SO MY HEAD WOULDN´T GET SUCKED
IN THE PUNCH PRESS.

01:17.848 --> 01:20.511
BUT I´M A MANAGER NOW,
AND THIS HAIR SAYS

01:20.511 --> 01:22.513
THAT I PLAY
BY MY OWN RULES.

01:22.513 --> 01:26.187
I MIGHT PLAY GUITAR.
YOU DON´T KNOW ME.

01:26.187 --> 01:28.159
HONEY, THAT´S OKAY.

01:28.159 --> 01:31.262
´CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT´S SEXIER
THAN A GUY WITH LONG HAIR?

01:31.262 --> 01:34.465
A GUY WITH SHORT HAIR WHO
IS GOING TO MEET THE PRESIDENT.

01:34.465 --> 01:38.729
YOU´RE TALKING
ABOUT ME, RIGHT?

01:38.729 --> 01:41.302
HEY. AS LONG AS YOU´RE
GETTING THINGS CUT,

01:41.302 --> 01:44.805
WHY DON´T YOU DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT SKID MARK

01:44.805 --> 01:46.407
ON YOUR CHIN?

01:46.407 --> 01:48.679
I´LL SHAVE MINE
WHEN YOU SHAVE YOURS.

01:50.781 --> 01:53.644
I BETTER GO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT
WITH MY MAN LIONEL.

01:53.644 --> 01:56.217
OH, HEY, HEY, DON´T CALL HIS
BARBERSHOP. IT´S CLOSED DOWN.

01:56.217 --> 01:58.549
HE´S CUTTING HAIR OVER
AT MY BEAUTY SALON NOW.

01:58.549 --> 02:01.152
OH, GREAT. NOW I GOTTA SIT
AROUND LA CASA DE COIFFURES

02:01.152 --> 02:03.724
AND LISTEN TO OLD BATS
TALKING ABOUT HOW

02:03.724 --> 02:07.127
"ERIK ESTRADA --
HE STILL LOOKS GOOD."

02:07.127 --> 02:10.201
HEY, WHAT DOES
THIS JUNK DO?

02:10.201 --> 02:13.334
THAT HIDES BLEMISHES.

02:13.334 --> 02:15.736
YOU GOT ANYTHING
THAT WILL HIDE 30 YEARS

02:15.736 --> 02:19.139
OF SMOKE
AND TEQUILA BACK SPLASH?

02:19.139 --> 02:23.143
THE LA MARIE PAPER BAG?

02:23.143 --> 02:25.746
COME ON,
I NEED SOME NEW MAKEUP.

02:25.746 --> 02:28.349
YOU KNOW,
THE PRESIDENT´S COMING...

02:28.349 --> 02:32.553
YOU DON´T CARE
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT.

02:32.553 --> 02:34.725
OH, MY GOD.

02:34.725 --> 02:37.228
YOU´VE GOT A MAN!

02:37.228 --> 02:39.290
SHUT UP.

02:39.290 --> 02:41.692
COME ON.

02:41.692 --> 02:43.334
SPILL IT.

02:43.334 --> 02:45.396
WHO IS HE,
AND WHERE´D YOU MEET HIM?

02:45.396 --> 02:46.467
COME ON, TELL ME.

02:46.467 --> 02:48.168
ALL RIGHT,
HIS NAME IS RANDY.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.900
HE WORKS THE FORKLIFT
AT THE FACTORY.

02:49.900 --> 02:51.602
IS IT SERIOUS?

02:51.602 --> 02:56.477
WOULD I BE ASKING YOU ABOUT
THIS WHORE PAINT IF IT WASN´T?

02:56.477 --> 03:00.251
BENNY, I AM SO HAPPY
FOR YOU.

03:00.251 --> 03:02.683
I THINK IT´S GREAT
WHEN TWO PEOPLE YOUR AGE --

03:02.683 --> 03:05.316
MY AGE?

03:05.316 --> 03:07.418
I DON´T THINK SO.

03:07.418 --> 03:09.360
RANDY IS 42.

03:09.360 --> 03:11.792
I DON´T WANT SOME OLD GUY

03:11.792 --> 03:15.396
WHERE FOREPLAY IS SOMEBODY
YELLING OUT "CLEAR!"

04:03.243 --> 04:06.517
AHEM. DO I LOOK GOOD
OR WHAT?

04:06.517 --> 04:09.850
YOU LOOK LIKE THE PIT BOSS
AT AN INDIAN CASINO.

04:17.688 --> 04:20.361
KIDS, GET OUT HERE!

04:20.361 --> 04:24.865
WHERE DID YOU GET
AN AMERICAN FLAG TIE?

04:24.865 --> 04:26.997
I BORROWED IT FROM ONE
OF MY BUDDIES AT WORK.

04:26.997 --> 04:29.340
HE´S A SIKH.
HE KEEPS IT IN THE LOCKER

04:29.340 --> 04:31.572
IN CASE
THERE´S A TERRORIST ATTACK.

04:31.572 --> 04:33.804
WHAT´S GOING ON, DAD?

04:33.804 --> 04:35.806
JUST THOUGHT YOU KIDS
MIGHT WANT TO SEE

04:35.806 --> 04:37.678
WHAT YOUR FATHER´S GOING
TO LOOK LIKE

04:37.678 --> 04:39.750
WHEN HE MEETS THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.

04:39.750 --> 04:40.711
WHAT?

04:40.711 --> 04:42.052
THAT´S RIGHT.

04:42.052 --> 04:44.385
GEORGE W. BUSH IS COMING
TO SPEAK AT THE FACTORY,

04:44.385 --> 04:46.286
AND I´LL BE STANDING
RIGHT NEXT TO HIM

04:46.286 --> 04:49.320
REPRESENTING! Y TODO.
I´M GOING TO BE LIKE THIS.

04:51.622 --> 04:53.994
I CAN´T BELIEVE YOU´RE EXCITED
ABOUT MEETING THE PRESIDENT.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.526
YOU DIDN´T EVEN VOTE
FOR HIM.

04:55.526 --> 04:57.528
HEY, HEY,
YOUNG LADY.

04:57.528 --> 04:59.530
I DIDN´T VOTE
FOR ANYBODY.

04:59.530 --> 05:02.333
THEN WHY DO YOU CARE
ABOUT MEETING HIM?

05:02.333 --> 05:04.335
DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHERE I COME FROM?

05:04.335 --> 05:06.477
CARMEN, I USED TO SWIM
IN MY UNDERWEAR

05:06.477 --> 05:08.609
BECAUSE I COULDN´T AFFORD
A SWIMSUIT.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.811
AND NOW I´M GOING TO MEET
THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.813
THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME.

05:12.813 --> 05:15.045
DAD, YOU STILL SWIM
IN YOUR UNDERWEAR.

05:15.045 --> 05:18.519
WELL, THAT´S MY CHOICE NOW.

05:18.519 --> 05:20.791
I WOULDN´T WANT
TO MEET A PRESIDENT

05:20.791 --> 05:22.893
WHO´S WASTING MONEY
ON BOMBS AND TANKS

05:22.893 --> 05:24.895
WHEN THERE ARE HUNGRY,
SICK PEOPLE OUT THERE.

05:24.895 --> 05:27.027
HEY, THAT WASTED MONEY
IS SPENT ON PLANES

05:27.027 --> 05:29.029
THAT I MAKE
AND THAT PUTS FOOD

05:29.029 --> 05:31.031
ON THIS TABLE.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.564
HOW CAN YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT
KNOWING YOU HELPED BOMB BABIES?

05:33.564 --> 05:35.566
CARMEN, CARMEN, WE DON´T
MAKE THE BOMBS.

05:35.566 --> 05:37.568
WE MAKE THE LANDING GEAR

05:37.568 --> 05:39.640
SO THE PLANES CAN COME BACK
AND RELOAD.

05:39.640 --> 05:42.873
READ THE SHIRT, DAD.

05:42.873 --> 05:44.715
WHAT?

05:44.715 --> 05:46.847
"SMART BOMBS ARE DUMB."

05:46.847 --> 05:48.579
WOW.

05:48.579 --> 05:51.782
I DIDN´T REALIZE HOW POWERFUL
A RHINESTONE T-SHIRT COULD BE.

05:53.484 --> 05:55.556
YOU DON´T KNOW WHAT
YOU´RE TALKING ABOUT, CARMEN,

05:55.556 --> 05:57.828
AND YOU DON´T GET WHAT
A GREAT COUNTRY THIS IS.

05:57.828 --> 05:59.930
WHERE ELSE CAN
A SECOND-GENERATION

05:59.930 --> 06:02.433
MEXICAN-AMERICAN FACTORY WORKER
WHO CAN´T NAME HIS CONGRESSMAN

06:02.433 --> 06:04.635
AND WHO IGNORES
ALL HIS JURY SUMMONS

06:04.635 --> 06:07.698
MEET THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES?

06:07.698 --> 06:09.870
YOU KNOW WHAT, ANGIE?
NEXT TIME YOU BUY STAMPS,

06:09.870 --> 06:12.042
FORGET ABOUT LUCY AND DESI,
GET THE ONES WITH THE FLAGS.

06:12.042 --> 06:13.404
I´M READY!

06:14.905 --> 06:17.778
CARMEN, YOU DON´T KNOW
HOW GOOD YOU HAVE IT HERE.

06:17.778 --> 06:20.581
MY UNCLES ARE IN JAIL
IN CUBA

06:20.581 --> 06:22.883
BECAUSE THEY DARED
TO EXPRESS THEIR OPINIONS.

06:22.883 --> 06:25.055
THAT´S NOT WHY
THEY´RE IN JAIL.

06:25.055 --> 06:27.858
I´M MAKING A POINT.

06:27.858 --> 06:29.720
OKAY, WELL,

06:29.720 --> 06:32.663
SINCE I CAN EXPRESS MYSELF,
I´M GOING DOWN TO THE FACTORY

06:32.663 --> 06:34.995
AND PROTEST
THE PRESIDENT´S SPEECH.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.997
OH, YOU DO,
AND I´LL KILL YOU.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.469
GEORGE.

06:38.469 --> 06:41.401
NO, I´M SERIOUS.
I´LL KILL YOU.

06:41.401 --> 06:44.475
YOU BETTER NOT SHOW UP
AT THE FACTORY, CARMEN.

06:44.475 --> 06:46.477
SO, WHAT, I´M LIKE
A POLITICAL PRISONER NOW?

06:46.477 --> 06:49.079
THIS IS AMERICA, OKAY? PEOPLE
FOUGHT AND DIED FOR THAT RIGHT.

06:51.642 --> 06:53.784
I THOUGHT YOU JUST SAID
WAR WAS WRONG.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.592
HI, BENNY.

07:01.592 --> 07:02.723
SYLVIA.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.795
OH, MY GOD,
IS THAT GEORGIE?

07:04.795 --> 07:07.698
WHAT´S IT BEEN,
25 YEARS?

07:07.698 --> 07:09.500
WHAT´S UP, SYLVIA?

07:09.500 --> 07:11.902
LAST TIME I SAW YOU,
YOU WERE CRYING.

07:11.902 --> 07:15.105
EVERY TIME I SAW YOU,
YOU WERE CRYING.

07:15.105 --> 07:17.708
BECAUSE EVERY TIME YOU SAW ME,
SHE WAS MY MOM.

07:19.109 --> 07:21.441
COME HERE,
LET ME LOOK AT YOU.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.443
SHE´S CALLING YOU.
I´M NOT GOING
OVER THERE.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.717
GO OVER THERE.
THAT´S YOUR FRIEND.
SHE AIN´T MY FRIEND.

07:26.717 --> 07:30.220
LOOK AT YOU.
YOU´RE ALL GROWN UP NOW.

07:30.220 --> 07:32.983
I HEARD YOU TRACKED DOWN
THAT DEADBEAT DAD OF YOURS

07:32.983 --> 07:34.685
AND DECKED HIM.

07:34.685 --> 07:36.827
DROPPED HIM
WITH ONE PUNCH.

07:36.827 --> 07:38.929
BUT THAT´S NOT SOMETHING
I´M PROUD OF.

07:38.929 --> 07:41.131
I JUST, YOU KNOW...

07:41.131 --> 07:43.734
HANDLED MY BUSINESS.

07:43.734 --> 07:45.566
GOOD FOR YOU.

07:45.566 --> 07:48.168
YOU STILL WET THE BED?

07:49.640 --> 07:51.141
YOU TOLD HER?

07:51.141 --> 07:55.646
I TELL EVERYBODY. THAT´S
HOW I BREAK THE ICE.

07:57.247 --> 07:58.879
GEORGE, WHAT´S UP, BROTHER?

07:58.879 --> 08:01.251
WHAT´S HAPPENING, LIONEL?

08:01.251 --> 08:02.653
ALL RIGHT.

08:02.653 --> 08:04.585
HEY, MAN, WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR SHOP?

08:04.585 --> 08:07.618
HEY, THIS IS GREAT.
BESIDES, THE PRICE WAS RIGHT,

08:07.618 --> 08:11.722
AND I GET A CHANCE
TO HANG OUT WITH ALL THE...

08:11.722 --> 08:15.996
BONITA SEÑORITAS.

08:15.996 --> 08:21.632
AND I GET A LITTLE TASTE
OF THAT EVERY NOW AND THEN.

08:21.632 --> 08:24.174
WHAT ELSE ARE WE DOING
TODAY, BENNY?

08:24.174 --> 08:28.679
JUST A MANICURE
AND A READING.

08:35.045 --> 08:37.548
DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION
FOR THE TAROT?

08:37.548 --> 08:39.690
I WANT TO KNOW
IF IT´S GOING TO WORK OUT

08:39.690 --> 08:42.853
BETWEEN ME AND RANDY.

08:42.853 --> 08:45.525
I SEE OBSTACLES.

08:45.525 --> 08:48.258
THE FOOL CARD
IN THE PAST POSITION.

08:48.258 --> 08:51.732
THAT´S GEORGE.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.834
HE´S ALWAYS JEALOUS
OF THE GUYS

08:53.834 --> 08:55.165
I´VE DATED.

08:55.165 --> 08:57.868
IF I DIDN´T SLIP HIM
A LITTLE BOURBON

08:57.868 --> 09:00.170
IN HIS SIPPY CUP
NOW AND THEN,

09:00.170 --> 09:02.643
I NEVER WOULD´VE GONE OUT.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.645
DOES HE LIKE THE GUY?

09:04.645 --> 09:06.046
HE DOESN´T KNOW.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.218
YOU´VE GOT
TO TELL GEORGE.

09:08.218 --> 09:10.280
YEAH, WHAT IF I DON´T?

09:10.280 --> 09:12.282
IT´S THE DEATH CARD,
BENNY.

09:12.282 --> 09:14.224
IF YOU DON´T TELL HIM,

09:14.224 --> 09:16.326
YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WILL DIE.

09:16.326 --> 09:18.829
OH, WAIT, HOW DO I KNOW
THESE VOODOO CARDS

09:18.829 --> 09:21.191
ARE TALKING ABOUT ME?

09:21.191 --> 09:23.563
THE EMPRESS.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.066
THE NURTURING MOTHER.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.739
OH, MY GOD, THAT´S ME!

09:40.781 --> 09:43.814
HEY, GEORGE,

09:43.814 --> 09:47.117
I´M THINKING ABOUT DATING
AGAIN, SO GET USED TO IT.

09:47.117 --> 09:49.359
WHAT? WHO TOLD YOU THAT --
SYLVIA?

09:49.359 --> 09:52.723
GEORGE, I´M NOT KIDDING.
I´VE BEEN ALONE TOO LONG.

09:52.723 --> 09:54.364
MOM, WHERE ARE YOU GOING
TO FIND A GUY?

09:54.364 --> 09:57.297
OH, I DON´T KNOW. COME ON,
THERE´S ABOUT 50 GUYS

09:57.297 --> 09:59.599
TO PICK FROM AT THE PLANT.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.931
GEORGE, DON´T BE SURPRISED

10:00.931 --> 10:03.603
IF SOMEDAY I COME BACK
FROM BREAK

10:03.603 --> 10:07.738
WITH A SMILE ON MY FACE
AND MY DRESS ON BACKWARDS.

10:07.738 --> 10:09.940
NO, NO.

10:09.940 --> 10:11.942
NO GUYS FROM THE FACTORY.

10:11.942 --> 10:14.144
I DON´T WANT THIS
AFFECTING YOUR WORK.

10:14.144 --> 10:16.186
BESIDES,
YOU´RE FIVE YEARS AWAY

10:16.186 --> 10:18.388
FROM WEARING YOUR DRESS
BACKWARDS ANYWAYS.

10:18.388 --> 10:22.022
SO,
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

10:22.022 --> 10:24.154
OH, WELL, START CUTTING.
I´LL SAY WHEN.

10:24.154 --> 10:27.297
OH, NO, I´M NOT CUTTING
THAT BEAUTIFUL MANE.

10:27.297 --> 10:29.299
MAN, YOU HAVE TO.

10:29.299 --> 10:31.301
MY BOSSES WANT ME TO LOOK
MORE RESPECTABLE.

10:31.301 --> 10:33.403
HEY, LIONEL,
I´M MEETING PRESIDENT BUSH.

10:33.403 --> 10:34.765
ALL RIGHT.

10:34.765 --> 10:37.137
BUT I´M NOT DOING IT
FOR THE PRESIDENT.

10:37.137 --> 10:41.141
I´M DOING IT
FOR CONDOLEEZZA.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.643
´CAUSE I´D LIKE TO GET
A LITTLE TASTE OF THAT.

10:53.323 --> 10:56.086
AND THANKS TO THE PEOPLE
OF POWERS AVIATION --

10:56.086 --> 10:58.889
PEOPLE LIKE GEORGE LOPEZ

10:58.889 --> 11:02.032
AND BILL JOHNSON

11:02.032 --> 11:04.034
AND LaTONYA HARRIS.

11:04.034 --> 11:08.268
