WEBVTT

00:05.898 --> 00:09.102
Happy New Year, congratulations
on getting married, sir.

00:09.222 --> 00:13.586
I know I didn't deserve to be invited
so I thought I'd give your gift now.

00:13.706 --> 00:15.778
Not if it's a song.

00:15.846 --> 00:18.314
It's not.
It's...

00:18.381 --> 00:21.000
This belt.

00:21.084 --> 00:22.785
Oh.

00:22.853 --> 00:24.887
Well, the nuptials
were perfect.

00:24.955 --> 00:27.356
We rented a villa
on St. Esclavage.

00:27.424 --> 00:29.558
For my second wedding, I just
wanted a five-minute ceremony

00:29.626 --> 00:31.660
surrounded by one giant party,

00:31.728 --> 00:33.629
so the service was performed

00:33.697 --> 00:36.799
by an exiled French
admiral/defrocked minister.

00:41.271 --> 00:43.439
Well, I'm glad
it went smoothly.

00:43.507 --> 00:45.772
- ♪ You and I... ♪
- Uh, the only hiccup

00:45.892 --> 00:47.226
was that my best man,

00:47.310 --> 00:49.445
deep sea explorer
and raconteur Bob Ballard,

00:49.512 --> 00:51.480
took ill after eating
some bad toucan.

00:51.548 --> 00:55.417
So, uh, Lemon filled in
as my best man.

00:57.120 --> 01:00.122
This is from St. Esclavage.

01:00.190 --> 01:03.058
It's my marriage certificate.

01:03.126 --> 01:05.194
Oh, good God.

01:11.835 --> 01:21.881

01:28.685 --> 01:30.664
Liz Lemon,
I want it to be noted

01:30.784 --> 01:32.154
that I'm here on time.

01:32.222 --> 01:35.157
This is a new year
and a fresh start for me.

01:35.225 --> 01:37.109
Now I got to go.

01:37.194 --> 01:38.828
Where are you going?

01:38.895 --> 01:40.963
I'm hosting the International
Pornography Awards.

01:41.031 --> 01:43.232
And I have to go get
an insurance physical

01:43.300 --> 01:44.800
so I can fly into the arena

01:44.868 --> 01:46.936
in a penis-shaped parachute.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:57.013 --> 02:00.216
Hey, what is going on
with Jenna's dressing room?

02:00.283 --> 02:02.051
Jack rented it out
to an I.T. company.

02:02.118 --> 02:03.819
The Kabletown board
is meeting this week

02:03.887 --> 02:06.488
to approve buying NBC, and
he's doing everything possible

02:06.556 --> 02:08.306
to make us seem profitable.

02:08.390 --> 02:11.794
He turned the green room
into an NBC experience store.

02:11.862 --> 02:13.062
And we have to schedule
our rehearsals

02:13.129 --> 02:14.129
around the bat mitzvahs

02:14.197 --> 02:16.065
Jack has booked in the studio.

02:16.132 --> 02:18.400
When Madison was born,
I said, "Rivka,

02:18.468 --> 02:20.836
my schveltz is filled
with schpoinkis."

02:20.904 --> 02:23.205
Okay, well, I'm gonna talk
to Jack about this.

02:23.273 --> 02:25.407
I'm sure he's still in
a good mood from the wedding.

02:25.475 --> 02:27.142
- Oh, yeah, how was that?
- Total chaos...

02:27.210 --> 02:28.177
No rehearsal,

02:28.245 --> 02:29.411
no program,

02:29.462 --> 02:31.046
the bride wore
a black cocktail dress.

02:31.114 --> 02:32.681
The airline lost my luggage,

02:32.749 --> 02:34.817
and the only place
to buy anything on the island

02:34.885 --> 02:36.151
was at the tennis pro shop.

02:36.219 --> 02:38.604
Luckily, I had the essentials
in my carry-on...

02:38.672 --> 02:40.322
toiletries,
closed-toe shoes,

02:40.390 --> 02:42.324
and the state department-
recommended mosquito head nets.

02:42.392 --> 02:44.059
I sense more complaining
in you.

02:44.127 --> 02:45.060
Terrible flower girl.

02:45.128 --> 02:46.428
At four years old,
you should know

02:46.496 --> 02:47.863
how to pace
your petal distribution.

02:47.931 --> 02:51.317
Hannah, petal, step,
petal, step.

02:51.401 --> 02:52.851
Come on!

02:52.936 --> 02:55.321
And don't even get me started
on the monkeys.

02:55.405 --> 02:57.740
You!
It needs to see Mr. Donaghy.

02:57.807 --> 02:59.441
It needs to see him right away.

02:59.492 --> 03:02.011
Get us all our stuff back.

03:04.047 --> 03:05.948
- Hey.
- Elizabeth, shut the door.

03:08.485 --> 03:10.953
Lemon,
during my wedding ceremony,

03:11.004 --> 03:13.772
do you remember being asked
a question by the minister?

03:13.840 --> 03:15.841
Yeah.
It was something like...

03:17.811 --> 03:19.328
And in spite
of not understanding,

03:19.379 --> 03:22.264
you responded, <i>"Oui."</i>

03:22.332 --> 03:24.600
Well, one of my new year's
resolutions is to say yes...

03:24.668 --> 03:26.468
yes to love, yes to life,

03:26.536 --> 03:28.737
yes to staying in more.

03:28.805 --> 03:32.691
Do you remember signing
this document afterwards?

03:32.776 --> 03:34.410
Yeah.
The minister told me to...

03:34.477 --> 03:37.112
On the <i>epouse</i> line.

03:37.180 --> 03:39.114
Witness.

03:39.182 --> 03:41.417
Not witness.

03:41.484 --> 03:44.320
No, Lemon...

03:44.387 --> 03:45.454
Wife.

03:45.522 --> 03:47.389
Mother...

03:50.193 --> 03:52.895
<i>Vous partagez?</i>
<i>C'est tres europeen.</i>

03:52.963 --> 03:55.297
<i>Est-ce que je peux vous joindre</i>
<i>dans votre partage?</i>

03:55.365 --> 03:56.332
<i>Oui.</i>

03:56.383 --> 03:58.667
They married us by mistake?

03:58.735 --> 04:00.369
It is a clerical error

04:00.437 --> 04:03.472
that will be rectified
immediately.

04:03.539 --> 04:05.140
See, this is exactly the kind
of thing that happens

04:05.208 --> 04:07.343
when there is no order,
no planning.

04:07.394 --> 04:09.912
Hitler and Martha Stewart
would have hated that wedding.

04:09.980 --> 04:11.430
Of course,
it's everyone else's fault

04:11.514 --> 04:12.781
that the minister thought
the lady

04:12.849 --> 04:14.283
in the white dress and the veil
was the bride.

04:14.351 --> 04:15.768
It was a men's tennis shirt

04:15.852 --> 04:17.519
and a government-sanctioned
head net.

04:17.587 --> 04:19.188
You kept holding on to my arm.

04:19.238 --> 04:20.923
It's hard to balance on sand.

04:20.991 --> 04:22.758
Who wears shoes on a beach?

04:22.826 --> 04:25.027
Only Rocky and Apollo Creed

04:25.095 --> 04:26.862
during the training montage.

04:26.930 --> 04:29.331
Who cares?
You're fixing it.

04:29.399 --> 04:30.966
I'm sorry you got caught up
in another one

04:31.034 --> 04:32.201
of Liz Lemon's adventures.

04:32.268 --> 04:34.370
My adventures...
I am the protagonist.

04:34.437 --> 04:37.906
Avery is in China right now
covering an economic conference.

04:37.974 --> 04:39.174
She is not a spy.

04:39.242 --> 04:40.976
I want this taken care of
before she gets back.

04:41.044 --> 04:43.178
Divorce papers
are being drawn up.

04:43.246 --> 04:44.680
Try to sign on the right line.

04:44.748 --> 04:46.949
Whatever you say, dear.

04:47.017 --> 04:49.451
Do not.
Do not.

04:49.519 --> 04:50.919
Don't forget, honey,

04:50.987 --> 04:53.389
we have bridge
with the Cunninghams tonight.

04:54.590 --> 04:56.825
Tracy, you are going to die...

04:56.893 --> 04:58.527
What?
No!

04:58.595 --> 04:59.978
When I tell you who I'm dating.

05:00.063 --> 05:01.363
Squeaky fromme.

05:01.431 --> 05:03.999
She is difficult.

05:04.067 --> 05:05.117
Anyhoo,

05:05.201 --> 05:07.169
I have the results
of your physical.

05:07.237 --> 05:09.505
Tracy, you are going to die.

05:09.572 --> 05:11.073
What?
No!

05:11.141 --> 05:12.607
You have no reflexes.

05:12.659 --> 05:14.443
Your blood tastes
like root beer.

05:14.511 --> 05:16.845
And some of your bones
appear to have vanished.

05:16.913 --> 05:18.647
Now, I've only ever seen
this kind of thing

05:18.715 --> 05:21.083
on dead people
during operation Desert Storm.

05:21.151 --> 05:22.584
I actually wrote
a report on it,

05:22.652 --> 05:25.454
but my commander refused
to pass it on up to Saddam.

05:25.522 --> 05:27.256
Kooky times.

05:27.323 --> 05:29.658
But I can't die,
Dr. Space-Man.

05:29.726 --> 05:31.310
Who will be there
to raise my kids

05:31.394 --> 05:34.163
if I'm not around to pay someone
to raise my kids?

05:34.230 --> 05:35.998
Look, making even minor changes

05:36.066 --> 05:37.866
to your unhealthy lifestyle
would help,

05:37.934 --> 05:39.368
like diet and exercise.

05:39.436 --> 05:41.570
Well, we tried.

05:41.638 --> 05:43.772
Oh, look, I'm sorry, Tracy.

05:43.840 --> 05:45.274
But on the bright side,

05:45.341 --> 05:47.109
at least your family's
financially set for life.

05:47.177 --> 05:49.011
Now, this could
literally kill you.

05:49.079 --> 05:50.846
Lollipop?

05:55.885 --> 05:58.887
Thank you for taking
in Miss Maroney, Mr. Baker.

05:58.955 --> 06:02.207
We would have asked you sooner,
but we forgot you worked here.

06:02.292 --> 06:04.009
Thank you
for doing this, Danny.

06:04.094 --> 06:06.128
It's gonna be fun.

06:06.179 --> 06:07.679
Yeah.

06:07.764 --> 06:09.631
It's like...
it's like we're married.

06:10.767 --> 06:12.201
Now, don't you two
start bickering

06:12.268 --> 06:13.368
like old married folks.

06:22.045 --> 06:23.078
Are you okay?

06:23.146 --> 06:25.114
It's just I got a haircut,

06:25.181 --> 06:26.415
and you didn't even notice.

06:26.483 --> 06:27.449
Sorry.

06:27.517 --> 06:29.151
You get your hair cut
every week.

06:29.219 --> 06:30.702
Excuse me?

06:30.787 --> 06:31.987
I don't like your tone.

06:32.055 --> 06:33.989
And I don't like
what you've turned into.

06:34.040 --> 06:36.325
I'm not the one who forgot
our one-minute anniversary.

06:36.392 --> 06:38.293
Finally,
as the merger progresses,

06:38.361 --> 06:40.629
you'll notice some changes
to your benefits,

06:40.697 --> 06:43.398
including
new health care options.

06:43.466 --> 06:47.402
I'm sorry. That should read
"few health care options."

06:47.470 --> 06:49.721
I've got to redo this.

06:50.907 --> 06:52.307
You have to talk to Jack.

06:52.375 --> 06:53.976
I can't lose my dental.

06:54.043 --> 06:56.428
There's a hygienist there whose
boob sometimes touches my ear.

06:56.513 --> 06:58.647
Yeah, go upstairs and tell
your boyfriend to help us.

06:58.715 --> 07:00.549
Jack is not my boyfriend.

07:00.600 --> 07:02.684
He is, dot-dot-dot,

07:02.752 --> 07:04.353
my husband.

07:05.555 --> 07:07.122
On your wedding night,
did he take you

07:07.190 --> 07:08.290
in the French fashion?

07:08.358 --> 07:10.259
No, there was a mix-up
in St. Esclavage,

07:10.326 --> 07:12.127
and Jack and I
are technically married.

07:12.195 --> 07:13.328
Oh, my God.

07:13.396 --> 07:14.997
Did you hear
what I asked you before?

07:15.064 --> 07:16.231
Liz, you should know

07:16.299 --> 07:18.300
that NBC has strict
antinepotism guidelines.

07:18.368 --> 07:20.102
If your husband is your boss,

07:20.170 --> 07:21.737
then you're both going
to have to come

07:21.804 --> 07:23.338
to my office and discuss this.

07:23.406 --> 07:24.773
What? No.
It's not real.

07:24.841 --> 07:27.109
- We're getting a divorce.
- That's what Ann Curry

07:27.177 --> 07:28.777
and Subhas the janitor
tried to tell me.

07:28.845 --> 07:31.313
That was five years ago.

07:31.381 --> 07:33.098
No, it's a mistake.

07:33.183 --> 07:35.083
We are signing something
tomorrow.

07:36.853 --> 07:39.021
Wait, Liz, we can use this.

07:39.088 --> 07:41.223
Jack needs a divorce.
You have leverage.

07:41.291 --> 07:42.524
What are you talking about?

07:42.592 --> 07:44.059
You don't sign
any divorce papers

07:44.110 --> 07:46.695
until we get the studio back,
our full budget,

07:46.763 --> 07:47.980
- our health insurance...
- Pete, I'm not...

07:48.064 --> 07:49.731
They shut down
your secret bathroom

07:49.799 --> 07:52.034
- to save on cleaning costs.
- I have to talk to my husband.

07:56.403 --> 07:57.738
No, no, Bob,
we made it very clear.

07:57.805 --> 08:00.540
You have to buy NBC
with everything else.

08:00.608 --> 08:04.378
Then just don't watch it.

08:04.445 --> 08:05.979
What is it, Lemon?

08:06.047 --> 08:08.281
I'm trying to negotiate
a $30 billion deal.

08:08.349 --> 08:10.117
That's billion with a "b."

08:10.184 --> 08:11.184
Is that right?

08:11.252 --> 08:13.220
That seems like way too much.

08:13.287 --> 08:15.088
Yeah, well, my staff and I
are also trying

08:15.156 --> 08:16.423
to do our jobs, but we can't

08:16.491 --> 08:18.358
without studio space
or health insurance

08:18.426 --> 08:20.494
or those vegetable chips
that I hate

08:20.561 --> 08:21.862
and I keep telling Kenneth
not to get.

08:21.929 --> 08:23.663
Let me show
you something, Lemon.

08:23.714 --> 08:27.100
This is
our NBC priority pie chart.

08:27.168 --> 08:28.769
The big red part you can see
is <i>The Biggest Loser.</i>

08:28.836 --> 08:31.204
The yellow slice,
our number-two priority,

08:31.272 --> 08:34.390
Make It 1997 Again
Through Science or Magic,

08:34.475 --> 08:35.909
and the little green part
is everything else.

08:35.977 --> 08:38.211
Request denied.

08:38.279 --> 08:41.114
No.
Request denial denied.

08:41.182 --> 08:43.283
You have to make <i>TGS</i>
a priority.

08:43.351 --> 08:46.720
Your show netted $600
last year.

08:46.788 --> 08:49.556
- Your parents had to buy an ad.
- I don't care.

08:49.624 --> 08:51.858
If I don't get what I deserve,

08:51.926 --> 08:54.528
I'm not signing
those divorce papers.

08:56.164 --> 08:59.933
Are you blackmailing me?

09:00.001 --> 09:01.585
You should think very carefully

09:01.669 --> 09:03.770
about what you're doing
right now.

09:03.838 --> 09:05.439
I am...

09:05.506 --> 09:06.640
Lots.

09:06.707 --> 09:08.041
Very well.

09:08.109 --> 09:09.910
We'll do this divorce
the hard way.

09:09.977 --> 09:11.511
But I'm warning you.

09:11.579 --> 09:13.146
This isn't
my first rodeo, Lemon.

09:13.214 --> 09:14.981
Well, I've been to a rodeo too.

09:15.049 --> 09:18.652
It was a cat rodeo
in a gay guy's apartment.

09:33.618 --> 09:35.368
Hey!

09:35.419 --> 09:37.604
What happened to my poster
of the Montreal Alouettes?

09:37.672 --> 09:39.122
It's signed by Marc Trestman.

09:39.207 --> 09:40.757
Oh, it's tacky, Danny,

09:40.842 --> 09:42.943
just like your mother's
stupid chain emails.

09:43.010 --> 09:45.312
Oh, here we go.

09:45.379 --> 09:47.347
Oh, my nails are wet!

09:49.383 --> 09:51.468
Mr. Hornberger...

09:51.552 --> 09:53.487
Do you and your wife
ever fight?

09:53.554 --> 09:55.055
Not all the time.

09:55.122 --> 09:57.791
After her hysterectomy,
she was in a coma briefly.

09:59.277 --> 10:00.727
How do y'all make up?

10:00.795 --> 10:04.798
Ah.

10:04.866 --> 10:07.801
Look, Paula and I love
each other,

10:07.869 --> 10:11.321
but two people living together,
it's unnatural.

10:11.405 --> 10:12.739
And while our children

10:12.790 --> 10:15.625
are basically snot silos
with bb guns,

10:15.710 --> 10:18.411
they do come in handy
as a buffer.

10:18.479 --> 10:20.146
Is that like being a fluffer?

10:20.214 --> 10:22.816
Because I have done that
and did not enjoy it.

10:22.884 --> 10:25.685
Blow-drying animals
at a pet salon is hard work.

10:25.753 --> 10:29.973
No, a buffer
is a protective barrier.

10:30.057 --> 10:33.176
Like pigs have around
their delicious testicle meat.

10:33.261 --> 10:35.095
We can't fight around the kids.

10:35.162 --> 10:37.197
You see them looking up at you
with their little faces,

10:37.265 --> 10:38.865
their hair already receding,

10:38.933 --> 10:41.268
and you bite your tongue.

10:41.335 --> 10:44.571
A buffer.

10:44.639 --> 10:47.040
What is it?

10:47.108 --> 10:49.309
Thanks, Jack, for coming
to this emergency meeting.

10:49.377 --> 10:50.694
I'm sorry I'm four hours late,

10:50.778 --> 10:52.312
but my alarm clock
didn't go off

10:52.380 --> 10:54.698
because it died
in a cockfight last night.

10:54.782 --> 10:56.750
Tracy, what can I do for you?

10:56.817 --> 10:59.719
Well, it's come to my
attention that I'm going to die.

10:59.787 --> 11:02.289
Oh, please, you have nothing
to worry about.

11:02.356 --> 11:04.558
We have Martin Lawrence
on a holding deal.

11:04.625 --> 11:07.661
Look, I don't want anything
to happen to my husband.

11:07.728 --> 11:10.530
But if it did,
we have a lot of expenses.

11:10.598 --> 11:12.332
Estate planning is complicated,

11:12.383 --> 11:13.850
what, with the government
taking half.

11:13.935 --> 11:15.001
What?

11:15.069 --> 11:17.604
That's double taxation.

11:17.672 --> 11:19.406
I like you, Angie.

11:19.473 --> 11:20.523
How can I help?

11:20.608 --> 11:22.842
Well, to maintain
our standard of living,

11:22.910 --> 11:25.712
I need to be able to earn
as much as Tracy does.

11:25.780 --> 11:27.347
And if you need to make
millions of dollars

11:27.415 --> 11:29.316
but have no real skills
or education,

11:29.383 --> 11:32.352
the best place to do it
is in entertainment.

11:32.420 --> 11:34.888
I mean, look at me.

11:34.956 --> 11:38.725
I can't even find Mexico
on a map.

11:38.793 --> 11:40.727
Things are a little tight
at the company right now,

11:40.795 --> 11:43.296
but if you want to learn about
the entertainment business,

11:43.364 --> 11:44.898
I can find you something.

11:44.966 --> 11:47.667
Oh, yeah, I'm willing
to start at the bottom.

11:47.718 --> 11:49.302
There's only one thing
I won't do,

11:49.370 --> 11:51.504
and that's take orders
from anyone, ever.

11:55.476 --> 11:57.177
Hey, Angie, what are you doing?

11:57.244 --> 11:59.045
I'm sorry.
I'm not about to cancel

11:59.096 --> 12:01.431
my hair appointment with D'Fwan
because I'm your new intern.

12:01.515 --> 12:03.066
You need to light
some incense in here.

12:03.150 --> 12:05.452
Okay, hang on.
Who said you're my intern?

12:05.519 --> 12:07.654
It was Jack's idea.
I have to start a career.

12:07.721 --> 12:10.390
But I'm gonna need next week off
to go skiing.

12:10.458 --> 12:11.925
What?

12:11.993 --> 12:14.494
Okay, I see what this is.
Jack's messing with me.

12:14.561 --> 12:15.929
We're having a little fight,

12:15.997 --> 12:18.031
- so he sent you here...
- Excuse me.

12:18.082 --> 12:20.834
How is my being here
messing with you?

12:20.901 --> 12:23.169
Do you have a problem
with strong black women?

12:23.237 --> 12:24.371
No!
Don't you see?

12:24.422 --> 12:25.805
That's the kind of exchange
Jack wants.

12:25.873 --> 12:27.907
Angie, an intern's job

12:27.958 --> 12:31.461
is to do things like make copies
and run errands.

12:31.545 --> 12:33.296
So I'm like your servant?

12:33.381 --> 12:34.581
No, because
you're not being paid.

12:34.649 --> 12:36.650
You're really more like...

12:36.717 --> 12:37.917
Oh, boy.

12:37.985 --> 12:39.753
Look, Angie,
you don't want to be an intern.

12:39.820 --> 12:41.788
Don't tell me what I want.

12:41.856 --> 12:43.990
And I don't really have time
to mentor someone right now,

12:44.058 --> 12:45.792
so I don't think
this is a good idea.

12:45.860 --> 12:47.477
I don't understand.

12:47.561 --> 12:49.929
That white girl just fired you.

12:49.997 --> 12:51.398
Come on, D'Fwan,

12:51.465 --> 12:53.099
be a buddy.

12:59.373 --> 13:00.607
Hey.

13:00.675 --> 13:03.626
Idiot, don't touch the...

13:03.711 --> 13:05.078
Nothing.

13:05.146 --> 13:07.213
Love you.

13:08.783 --> 13:11.718
Look,
I made this picture of us.

13:11.786 --> 13:13.053
Did you draw that?

13:13.120 --> 13:16.156
You might need help.
That's awful for an adult.

13:16.223 --> 13:17.791
Well, I think
it's great, Kenneth.

13:17.858 --> 13:20.360
You should hang it on the wall.

13:24.265 --> 13:25.298
Careful!

13:25.349 --> 13:26.900
Don't coddle the boy.

13:26.967 --> 13:30.320
He can do it.

13:30.404 --> 13:31.838
Aah!

13:31.906 --> 13:34.074
Oh, my bones!

13:34.141 --> 13:36.276
- Now look what you did.
- You made him afraid.

13:36.343 --> 13:37.744
Oh, did I also make you
half a man?

13:37.812 --> 13:39.779
- You're ruining my life!
- What life?

13:39.847 --> 13:41.748
My bones.

13:41.816 --> 13:43.616
Lemon, why do I have
an appointment

13:43.684 --> 13:45.585
with Jeffrey Weinerslav
tomorrow morning?

13:45.653 --> 13:47.020
Every day
that I'm married to you,

13:47.088 --> 13:48.354
my life gets worse.

13:48.422 --> 13:50.090
That Angie thing
was real cute, Jack.

13:50.157 --> 13:51.758
And some of your plan worked.

13:51.826 --> 13:52.959
Yes, she hated me,

13:53.027 --> 13:55.295
and, yes, I mentioned slavery
by mistake.

13:55.362 --> 13:57.063
I knew I could count on you.

13:57.131 --> 13:59.199
But you also made me her boss,
so I fired her.

13:59.266 --> 14:01.101
She chased me around
for a while,

14:01.168 --> 14:03.403
so I hid in a closet
down on news,

14:03.471 --> 14:04.804
but then Subhas
and Ann Curry came in,

14:04.872 --> 14:06.106
just going to town on ea...

14:06.173 --> 14:09.109
- Damn it!
- Is this a game for you two?

14:09.176 --> 14:11.361
I thought you were trying
to help my family.

14:11.445 --> 14:12.746
My family!

14:12.813 --> 14:14.814
I'm not a pawn.

14:14.882 --> 14:15.882
I am a queen.

14:15.950 --> 14:17.283
You all are trash.

14:17.351 --> 14:19.152
And you know what Angie Jordan
does with the trash?

14:19.220 --> 14:21.721
She drags it out to the curb
for pickup.

14:21.789 --> 14:23.039
Angie, I did not mean...

14:23.124 --> 14:25.325
- I will rip your weave out.
- It's not a weave!

14:25.376 --> 14:26.726
- Oh, good God, Angie, no.
- Ow! She pulled my hair out.

14:26.794 --> 14:28.328
I should never have made you
an intern.

14:28.395 --> 14:30.430
- You're a star.
- That's right. I am.

14:30.498 --> 14:33.299
Entertainment
is where untalented people go

14:33.367 --> 14:35.602
to get rich,
and you have all the makings

14:35.669 --> 14:37.103
of a reality superstar...
hair pullingness,

14:37.171 --> 14:38.505
delusions of grandeur,

14:38.556 --> 14:40.073
an insanely short fuse,

14:40.141 --> 14:42.308
- catchphrases...
- It's my way till payday.

14:42.376 --> 14:43.877
That's the t-shirt.

14:43.944 --> 14:47.247
I should give you
your own reality show,

14:47.314 --> 14:49.082
Friday nights...

14:49.150 --> 14:50.416
11:00.

14:50.484 --> 14:54.320
What? That is when <i>TGS</i>
or wrestling is on.

14:54.388 --> 14:55.922
I guess I could reconsider
the time slot

14:55.990 --> 14:57.924
in exchange for your signature.

14:57.992 --> 14:59.793
Ugh.
You know what?

14:59.860 --> 15:01.694
I'm calling your bluff.

15:01.762 --> 15:03.329
You're not giving her
a TV show.

15:03.397 --> 15:05.949
FYI, I am friends
with a hilarious fat girl

15:06.033 --> 15:07.801
and a crazy-eyed,
divorced white lady

15:07.868 --> 15:09.335
who wants to be
in the music business.

15:09.403 --> 15:10.537
Oh, I'd watch that.

15:10.604 --> 15:12.272
- Can D'Fwan be on it?
- Mm-hmm.

15:12.339 --> 15:13.773
With his even gayer boyfriend.

15:13.841 --> 15:15.124
Okay, fine.

15:15.209 --> 15:17.377
Give her her own show,
and I will watch it

15:17.444 --> 15:20.246
on our TV in our house, because
I'm not signing anything.

15:20.314 --> 15:22.882
This is not over.

15:22.950 --> 15:24.717
You think my meth-addict
nephew should be on the show?

15:24.785 --> 15:26.786
Yes, please!

15:29.622 --> 15:32.239
Pete,
you and Paula fight a lot.

15:32.350 --> 15:33.750
No, I-I walked
into a door.

15:33.775 --> 15:34.792
I'm so clumsy.

15:34.860 --> 15:36.961
Jack is using <i>TGS</i>

15:37.028 --> 15:39.363
as leverage in our divorce.

15:39.414 --> 15:42.066
He says he's gonna replace us
with a reality show about Angie.

15:42.133 --> 15:44.168
- Oh, I'd watch that.
- Obviously.

15:44.236 --> 15:45.402
But how do I fight back?

15:45.470 --> 15:46.737
Well, first off,
you can't back down.

15:46.805 --> 15:48.138
If you do that, we get nothing.

15:48.206 --> 15:49.773
I agreed
to go to a furniture store

15:49.841 --> 15:51.575
instead of watching football
one time,

15:51.643 --> 15:53.210
and I haven't seen
a game since.

15:53.278 --> 15:55.579
Oh, I hear ya.
I mean, take Danny...

15:55.647 --> 15:58.132
Please.

15:58.216 --> 16:00.651
Then you got to hit them
where it hurts.

16:00.719 --> 16:03.187
Find their weakness
and viciously exploit it.

16:03.255 --> 16:04.388
That's what marriage is.

16:04.456 --> 16:08.125
Don't even get me started
on marriage.

16:08.193 --> 16:10.194
Thank you.

16:12.264 --> 16:15.666
Kenneth, your Danny
has something to tell you.

16:15.734 --> 16:17.668
What is it, Danny?

16:17.736 --> 16:21.138
Well, sport,
I'm gonna be moving out.

16:21.206 --> 16:23.540
I don't understand.

16:23.608 --> 16:25.943
Well, sometimes two people
who care about each other

16:26.011 --> 16:27.578
just can't live together.

16:27.646 --> 16:29.413
Oh, no, I get that.

16:29.481 --> 16:32.349
What I don't get is this
is Danny's dressing room.

16:32.417 --> 16:34.151
I'm gonna be staying
at the "y."

16:34.219 --> 16:35.619
It's that dark place
under the bleachers

16:35.687 --> 16:36.754
that's shaped like a wishbone.

16:36.821 --> 16:39.223
But you're my Danny and Jenna.

16:39.291 --> 16:41.725
And we'll always be
Danny and Jenna.

16:41.793 --> 16:43.994
We just won't be
Danny and Jenna together.

16:44.062 --> 16:45.429
And don't think

16:45.497 --> 16:48.766
for one second this means
we love you less.

16:48.833 --> 16:51.835
Know that it means that.

16:53.271 --> 16:54.905
Well, tell the board

16:54.973 --> 16:56.507
we are currently in talks...

16:56.574 --> 16:58.575
Hold on, please.

16:58.643 --> 17:01.078
Jonathan, I have asked you not
to call me at home

17:01.146 --> 17:02.279
after 11:00...

17:02.347 --> 17:05.249
Or before.

17:05.317 --> 17:07.184
She what?

17:08.819 --> 17:10.753
My husband and I

17:10.821 --> 17:14.558
are absolutely so pleased
to be underwriting

17:14.626 --> 17:18.846
the Jack and Elizabeth Donaghy
High School for Teen Drama,

17:18.913 --> 17:21.265
the Arts, and Feelings.

17:21.333 --> 17:24.101
- Son of a bitch.
- As embarrassed Americans,

17:24.169 --> 17:28.439
Jack and I pledge $5 million

17:28.506 --> 17:30.157
to create a new generation

17:30.225 --> 17:33.110
of choreographers
and puppeteers,

17:33.178 --> 17:36.113
clunes, video artists,

17:36.180 --> 17:38.148
and theatrical jugglers

17:38.216 --> 17:42.152
who will ask the world,
"what is art?"

17:42.220 --> 17:44.221
We know what art is.

17:44.289 --> 17:47.191
It's paintings of horses!

17:49.160 --> 17:50.711
Good morning.

17:50.795 --> 17:53.063
How is the happy couple today?

17:53.131 --> 17:55.966
Well, it's no surprise
we're sitting here.

17:56.034 --> 17:57.601
You two have always thrown off

17:57.669 --> 17:59.636
that "will they or won't they?" vibe.

17:59.704 --> 18:02.473
And it's been a real hoot
to watch your courtship.

18:02.540 --> 18:04.341
Okeydokey.

18:04.409 --> 18:06.310
Now, when two employees
get married,

18:06.378 --> 18:09.079
it is my job to make sure
that the employee

18:09.147 --> 18:12.483
is not receiving favoritism
from his or her boss.

18:12.550 --> 18:15.185
Favoritism? Really?
He's trying to cancel my show.

18:15.253 --> 18:17.254
Uh-huh, and what about your
little announcement last night?

18:17.322 --> 18:18.422
Do you know how many fires

18:18.490 --> 18:20.491
I had to put out this morning
because of you?

18:20.558 --> 18:22.259
And what was that voice?

18:22.327 --> 18:24.595
It is my imitation
of Drew Barrymore's impression

18:24.662 --> 18:25.696
of that crazy lady.

18:25.764 --> 18:27.164
Let's keep this meeting short.

18:27.232 --> 18:30.768
Our marriage is a technicality,
and it will be remedied.

18:30.835 --> 18:32.236
Also, in order
for there to be favoritism,

18:32.303 --> 18:34.872
we'd have
to actually still be friends.

18:34.939 --> 18:37.608
All righty.
Let's just dive on in.

18:37.675 --> 18:40.878
Does the employee spend
an inordinate amount of time

18:40.945 --> 18:44.214
in the employer's office
compared to other employees?

18:44.282 --> 18:45.382
Well, yes, I suppose,

18:45.450 --> 18:47.217
but only because Miss Lemon
is incapable

18:47.285 --> 18:49.153
of doing anything on her own.

18:49.220 --> 18:50.954
Oh, please, half the time
when I go up there,

18:51.022 --> 18:53.390
it's to help you choose a tie,
and they're all red or blue.

18:53.458 --> 18:54.825
Where I come from,

18:54.893 --> 18:56.360
if you have
more than two colors on a tie,

18:56.428 --> 18:59.396
it means you're looking
for a certain kind of bar.

18:59.464 --> 19:02.232
Are all workday conversations
business-related,

19:02.300 --> 19:06.003
or do personal issues
often dominate discussion,

19:06.071 --> 19:10.007
including but not limited to,
mothers, diarrhea,

19:10.075 --> 19:11.975
having babies,

19:12.043 --> 19:14.178
problems in the bedroom,
neckties,

19:14.245 --> 19:15.646
food issues,

19:15.713 --> 19:17.081
foot disorders,

19:17.148 --> 19:19.416
- having it all...
- Okay.

19:19.484 --> 19:22.186
Yes. In the past,
we have advised each other.

19:22.253 --> 19:25.422
For instance, Jack taught me
not to wear tan slacks

19:25.490 --> 19:26.757
with a tan turtleneck.

19:26.825 --> 19:28.926
I thought it looked nice,
but he rightly pointed out

19:28.977 --> 19:30.894
that it made me
look like a giant condom.

19:30.962 --> 19:32.729
And Lemon is the only one

19:32.797 --> 19:34.998
of my subordinates
who's not afraid to warn me

19:35.066 --> 19:38.068
when I'm being
too authoritative or handsome.

19:38.136 --> 19:40.437
Or when you have eye boogers.

19:40.505 --> 19:42.606
Have you spent time
with each other's families?

19:42.674 --> 19:44.708
Have you attended
special events together,

19:44.776 --> 19:46.710
such as class reunions,

19:46.778 --> 19:49.413
birthday
or holiday celebrations,

19:49.481 --> 19:50.747
weddings,

19:50.815 --> 19:52.583
or extended car trips?

19:52.650 --> 19:55.185
Are you each other's
emergency contacts?

19:55.253 --> 19:57.621
Do you ever drink together
at work,

19:57.689 --> 19:59.957
perhaps while summarizing
what you've learned

20:00.024 --> 20:01.925
over the day or week?

20:01.993 --> 20:03.660
Have you shared
intimate details

20:03.728 --> 20:05.629
of your fears, hopes,
and dreams,

20:05.697 --> 20:08.232
both personal and professional?

20:08.299 --> 20:12.402
Is this the longest and perhaps
most meaningful relationship

20:12.470 --> 20:14.071
in your life?

20:14.139 --> 20:16.807
Do you often find yourselves
thinking the same thing

20:16.875 --> 20:19.910
and then saying it
at the exact same time?

20:19.978 --> 20:21.912
- I apologize, Lemon.
- I'm sorry, Jack.

20:21.980 --> 20:23.647
I never should have tried
to blackmail you.

20:23.715 --> 20:24.982
I'll sign the papers.

20:25.049 --> 20:26.383
And I shouldn't have
threatened your show.

20:26.451 --> 20:27.784
I'll leave that
to the parental decency groups.

20:27.852 --> 20:29.953
And I'll back off on the budget

20:30.021 --> 20:31.288
and the bat mitzvahs.

20:31.356 --> 20:33.290
Okay.

20:33.358 --> 20:36.093
Now we're gonna do
word association.

20:36.161 --> 20:37.427
Foreplay...

20:37.495 --> 20:39.530
We're done, Weinerslav.

20:40.798 --> 20:42.699
Uh, try to walk
like a woman, Lemon.

20:42.750 --> 20:45.469
Your fly's open, Jack.

20:48.416 --> 20:49.613
I'm Angie.

20:49.650 --> 20:51.922
I think elegance and attitude
are the same thing.

20:52.042 --> 20:54.035
And I have IBS.

20:56.539 --> 20:59.412
I'm D'Fwan and I just want to be
accepted for who I am:

20:59.532 --> 21:00.877
a sexual maniac.

21:00.997 --> 21:03.623
And I'm Portia. I don't care
what anyone says.

21:03.667 --> 21:05.590
I keep the 3D glasses.

21:05.710 --> 21:07.389
I'm Randi, with an "i".

21:07.458 --> 21:11.600
My ex-husband's new girlfriend
is cheating on him...With me.

21:11.839 --> 21:14.247
Do you have any meth?
Or meth?

21:15.997 --> 21:18.306
It's my way till payday.

21:19.305 --> 21:25.751
