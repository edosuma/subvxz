WEBVTT

00:02.836 --> 00:05.380
[Dennis] Hey, come on, man. Be careful, man.
You're spilling on the floor.

00:05.464 --> 00:07.674
[Dee] I don't understand why
you don't just use a cup.

00:07.800 --> 00:10.051
I'm trying to be inconspicuous.
Inconspicu...

00:10.177 --> 00:12.345
Your entire mouth is
stained red, Frank. It is?

00:12.471 --> 00:14.430
Yeah. Aren't we gonna be
at the barbecue soon?

00:14.556 --> 00:17.433
Yeah. I'm pregaming, man. What's going on with you?
You're going off the deep end lately.

00:17.518 --> 00:20.311
I feel like he's been wading around
in the deep end for a while.

00:20.396 --> 00:23.439
No, bro, it's different.
He's staying out all hours of the night.

00:23.524 --> 00:26.567
I never see him. If he is around,
he's usually not even wearing clothes.

00:26.652 --> 00:28.986
[Mac, Dennis Laughing]
I'm wearing clothes now, bitch.

00:29.071 --> 00:31.489
You're wearing a shirt that's on
inside out and it's covered in grease.

00:31.615 --> 00:33.700
Yeah, you're really greasy.
It's not grease. It's sap.

00:33.784 --> 00:36.869
- Sap? How did you get covered in sap?
- I got really wasted.

00:36.954 --> 00:39.580
- I must've climbed a tree.
- You're really stepping up the insanity, huh?

00:39.665 --> 00:41.999
I'm trying to push myself.
I want to see how far I could go.

00:42.084 --> 00:44.460
I feel like you've been standing on
the edge of a cliff for a while now.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.462
I say hop off.
Let's see where you land.

00:46.547 --> 00:49.257
I really wish you wouldn't encourage him, man.
I really wish you wouldn't.

00:49.341 --> 00:52.218
If somebody wants to push his boundaries,
you gotta let him. Frank, jump.

00:52.302 --> 00:54.595
I never felt more alive
in my life.

00:54.722 --> 00:57.140
Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure.
There's the street, right there.

01:02.438 --> 01:05.022
What the hell?

01:05.107 --> 01:06.983
I thought we were going
to a barbecue, Frank.

01:07.109 --> 01:10.069
It's more of a party in the park.
We're at a cemetery.

01:10.154 --> 01:13.781
The party is in the cemetery.

01:13.866 --> 01:17.285
- Who has a party in a cemetery?
- [Frank] Your Uncle Max.

01:17.369 --> 01:19.078
He just croaked.

01:19.163 --> 01:22.999
Flush that turd down the drain!
[Chuckles]

01:57.785 --> 02:01.704
## [Bagpipes: "Amazing Grace"]

02:11.882 --> 02:14.801
Does anybody else feel
really uncomfortable?

02:14.885 --> 02:16.886
Yes. We're completely
underdressed. It's embarrassing.

02:17.012 --> 02:20.807
What are we doing here, Frank? What's your angle?
I wanna bang your Aunt Donna.

02:20.891 --> 02:23.935
Why would you wanna bang
our mom's sister...

02:24.019 --> 02:25.978
at the funeral of her husband?

02:26.063 --> 02:30.399
Hmm. Well, I don't know
how many years on this earth I got left.

02:30.484 --> 02:33.653
I'm gonna get
real weird with it.

02:33.737 --> 02:36.781
Meanwhile, block the wind.
I'm gonna roast this bone.

02:36.907 --> 02:38.407
[Dee] Okay.
Jesus Christ.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.201
Come on. Get in there.
[Dennis] What are you doing?

02:40.285 --> 02:42.245
That is enough. I've had enough.
He's definitely reached his limit.

02:42.329 --> 02:43.996
I've reached my limit,
that's for sure.

02:44.081 --> 02:45.873
Dude, this is what
I was talking about in the car.

02:45.958 --> 02:47.959
The guy is going off
the deep end, all right?

02:48.085 --> 02:50.211
Now it's starting to affect our lives.
Yeah.

02:50.295 --> 02:52.338
And I think maybe we should have
an intervention or something.

02:52.422 --> 02:54.340
An intervention
might be a good idea.

02:54.424 --> 02:57.677
If he starts banging Aunt Donna, we're gonna
have the garbage pail cousin in the mix.

02:57.761 --> 02:59.345
No! No!

02:59.429 --> 03:01.347
Whoa. Who is
the garbage pail cousin?

03:01.431 --> 03:03.307
Gail the Snail
is the garbage pail cousin.

03:03.392 --> 03:05.601
Oh, Charlie, she is the worst.

03:05.686 --> 03:08.980
We'd have these family parties and
she'd just glob onto me and Dennis.

03:09.106 --> 03:11.482
We couldn't get rid of her.
The only way was to torture her.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.484
And that's what we did. Yeah.
We'd throw her in the dryer.

03:13.610 --> 03:16.237
We'd throw salt on her. Yeah, we'd throw
salt on her 'cause she was the snail.

03:16.363 --> 03:18.823
Mm-hmm. Get it? Get it?
You throw salt on a snail, and...

03:18.949 --> 03:20.366
It shrivels her up.
It's supposed to shrivel up.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.618
Well, that sounds
a little messed up though, huh?

03:22.744 --> 03:24.328
You don't think we're proud
of that, do you? No.

03:24.413 --> 03:26.372
But you don't understand.
That's the only way you can handle her.

03:26.456 --> 03:28.833
She made us do those things.
And quite frankly, I resent her for it.

03:28.959 --> 03:32.086
What kind of a person salts another
human being? It's terrible.

03:32.212 --> 03:35.506
There's no joy in salting someone.
Everyone loses. Yeah.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.425
It sounds like a-
What's up, suckers?

03:37.509 --> 03:38.885
Hey, Gail.
Hey, Gail.

03:38.969 --> 03:43.014
You look different. I'm more confident.
I've grown into my body.

03:43.098 --> 03:45.182
You're sure showing
a lot of skin, huh?

03:45.267 --> 03:48.644
Jealous? I'm a woman now.
I'm not a virgin anymore.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.605
Cool. Thank you.
Okay.

03:50.689 --> 03:55.026
[Slurps] Hey, guys, you wanna
come to my car and take a puff?

03:55.110 --> 03:57.278
I got some medical marijuana.
[Slurps]

03:57.362 --> 04:00.448
- We're at your dad's funeral, Gail.
- What evs. I'm over it.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.992
Plus, if we all showed up
super high at the reception,

04:03.076 --> 04:05.828
everyone would be like,
"What?" [Slurps]

04:05.954 --> 04:07.747
Uh- Uh- Okay.
Come on.

04:07.831 --> 04:09.290
Whatever, Gail.
Yes, we'll do that.

04:09.416 --> 04:11.292
Wait in the car and we'll join you.
We'll come get you.

04:11.376 --> 04:13.002
- You guys gonna come?
- We'll come in a second.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.421
- Like five minutes?
- Five minutes. - Anything. Yes.

04:15.505 --> 04:17.548
Anything.
Whatever you say.

04:17.673 --> 04:19.926
[Growls] See, this is what happens
when you don't have salt.

04:20.010 --> 04:22.011
My God. There's not enough
salt in the world for her.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.888
The garbage pail cousin.

04:24.014 --> 04:27.350
Donna, Donna, Donna, Donna, Donna, Donna.
Hello, Frank.

04:27.476 --> 04:29.435
You surprised to see me?
No.

04:29.561 --> 04:31.771
Ooh.
You left several voice mails...

04:31.897 --> 04:35.858
congratulating me on my husband's death.
Well, I was pretty baked.

04:35.984 --> 04:38.110
What do you want?
I have a proposition for you.

04:38.195 --> 04:41.280
I think you and me
ought to bang.

04:41.406 --> 04:44.075
What?
Okay. Hear me out.

04:44.159 --> 04:46.535
Max never liked me.
I hated him.

04:46.620 --> 04:50.122
Barbara didn't like you.
You despised her.

04:50.207 --> 04:53.376
Now, what better way to get
back at them in the grave,

04:53.460 --> 04:57.463
really stick it to 'em,
if you and me plowed?

04:57.547 --> 05:01.467
I mean, really- [Grinds Teeth] Hmm?

05:01.551 --> 05:03.719
You get back to me.

05:07.391 --> 05:09.517
Hey. I'm Mac.

05:10.519 --> 05:12.687
[Sighs]
Barbara's ex-lover.

05:12.771 --> 05:14.563
She may have mentioned...

05:16.108 --> 05:18.025
You were gonna say something?
No.

05:18.110 --> 05:20.069
[Lips Smack]

05:21.905 --> 05:26.075
You said- No?
No. I was just breathing.

05:45.595 --> 05:47.513
I'll start
by commending you guys...

05:47.597 --> 05:49.640
for taking the initiative
to help Frank.

05:49.725 --> 05:53.060
Ah, we're caring people.
That's our nature.

05:53.145 --> 05:56.272
Um, what's Frank struggling
with the most right now?

05:56.398 --> 05:59.567
Ooh. Ah, he is trying to bang our aunt.
That's the big one.

05:59.693 --> 06:04.363
Uh, these things deal more with drug
and alcohol abuse. [Dee] Mm-hmm.

06:04.448 --> 06:07.074
Drugs and alcohol are rolled into
what we're talking about here...

06:07.200 --> 06:09.118
Oh, yeah.
With the aunt thing.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.703
So he does have
a drinking problem.

06:10.829 --> 06:12.496
Oh, big time. Big time.
Oh, lady.

06:12.581 --> 06:14.540
But if I'm being honest,
my problem's less with the fact...

06:14.624 --> 06:16.417
that he's drinking and more
that he's doing it without me.

06:16.501 --> 06:20.838
And then I start thinking, "What's wrong with me?
Am I not fun to drink with?"

06:20.922 --> 06:24.050
Oh, no. Don't do that to yourself.
You're plenty of fun to drink with.

06:24.176 --> 06:26.135
Trust me, Charlie.
You get really, really drunk. Oh, yeah.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.387
And then you get reckless,
and it's a lot of fun.

06:28.472 --> 06:29.847
So how do we go
about doing this?

06:29.931 --> 06:32.058
Do we ambush him
and then sort of like berate him...

06:32.142 --> 06:34.393
into becoming the guy
we wanna be around?

06:34.478 --> 06:36.437
You certainly don't berate him.

06:36.521 --> 06:39.815
He needs to know you're coming
from a place of love and concern.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.567
Mm-mmm. Too soft.

06:41.651 --> 06:46.030
I think we should come at him with
an iron fist and crush him into submission.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.365
Right, right.
If we're taking that approach,

06:48.492 --> 06:51.035
you might wanna be armed at
this intervention. Mm-hmm.

06:51.119 --> 06:53.120
Why- Why would
I need to be armed?

06:53.205 --> 06:55.372
Well, Frank's usually carrying
a little gun with him.

06:55.499 --> 06:57.750
- And he doesn't really hesitate to use it.
- [Dennis] And you know what?

06:57.834 --> 06:59.752
Have the gun out and ready to rock
when he comes in.

06:59.836 --> 07:03.881
- We'll all have guns. - It's just safer.
She could put it in her pants.

07:03.965 --> 07:06.008
If we maybe ambush Frank
with a net...

07:06.093 --> 07:08.260
or some kind of rope device,

07:08.386 --> 07:11.430
the gun will maybe drop out of his waist belt.
You wanna bring him in in a net?

07:11.515 --> 07:13.724
- [Dennis] That could get awkward.
- Just bring the gun.

07:13.850 --> 07:16.477
Bring a gun. I don't wanna get shot,
so just bring a gun, will you?

07:18.188 --> 07:22.358
You know,
I do offer group therapy.

07:24.319 --> 07:25.528
Yeah.
What are you doing?

07:25.654 --> 07:27.613
What is this you're doing?
What is that? What is that?

07:27.697 --> 07:32.201
With all due respect, you're talking
about bringing guns to an intervention,

07:32.285 --> 07:34.954
and you're drinking wine
out of a soda can.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.206
Yeah.
You put wine in the soda can?

07:37.332 --> 07:39.125
You didn't know, did you?
That's good.

07:39.209 --> 07:40.376
Soda.
You stole Frank's idea.

07:40.502 --> 07:42.086
Actually, it's a pretty good one.
It's a good idea.

07:42.212 --> 07:44.922
The guy's got great ideas. He's a smart man.
That's not what we're here about.

07:45.006 --> 07:48.759
- But I do feel like she just tried an
intervention on us. - Did you intervene on us?

07:48.844 --> 07:52.221
You know what I'm feeling? I'm feeling
like you've lost control of the room here.

07:52.347 --> 07:55.141
And we're the ones that are running things now.
I've lost my trust in you.

07:55.225 --> 07:57.685
- We can do this on our own.
- We can do the intervention without her.

07:57.769 --> 07:59.103
You guys think?
Why not?

07:59.229 --> 08:01.313
All right. Might as well give it a shot.
Let's just do that.

08:01.398 --> 08:02.982
[Dee] Thank you. Thanks for your help.
You did your best.

08:03.108 --> 08:04.692
After you.
No hard feelings.

08:04.776 --> 08:06.026
I'm gonna grab
some of this literature.

08:06.111 --> 08:07.444
She didn't do
that great of a job.

08:07.529 --> 08:09.029
No, but don't beat her
while she's down.

08:11.074 --> 08:14.743
[Chuckles, Gurgling]

08:16.955 --> 08:18.873
[Gurgling Continues] Frank,
here's another idea.

08:18.957 --> 08:21.333
Oh! Oh!
Where'd you come from?

08:21.418 --> 08:23.586
I've been walking next to you
the entire time.

08:23.670 --> 08:26.463
I'm sorry. I'm a little, uh, lit.

08:26.548 --> 08:29.967
And, uh, I've been
going over this thing.

08:30.093 --> 08:33.136
I'm trying to figure out how-
How to bang Donna. I know.

08:33.221 --> 08:35.639
You've been talking about
it for the last five miles.

08:35.724 --> 08:37.808
Dude, it doesn't matter.
I got a better idea.

08:37.893 --> 08:40.144
I think you should bang
Gail the Snail.

08:40.270 --> 08:42.270
My niece?
Yeah.

08:42.397 --> 08:45.065
Gail the Snail? Dude, what's
more depraved than that, huh?

08:45.150 --> 08:47.234
Plus, you're not blood related,
so it's not that weird.

08:47.319 --> 08:49.153
[Belches] That is a good idea.

08:49.237 --> 08:52.823
I like the way you're thinking.
[Belching]

08:52.949 --> 08:55.784
Ew!
What's in it for you?

08:55.911 --> 08:57.620
Huh?
[Belching]

08:57.746 --> 09:00.206
Oh! Jesus!
What's in it for you?

09:00.290 --> 09:02.458
Don't worry about
what's in it for me, dude.

09:02.542 --> 09:06.045
[Belches]
Good God! You are disgusting.

09:06.129 --> 09:08.422
A disgusting animal.

09:08.506 --> 09:12.801
[Belches, Gurgling]

09:16.056 --> 09:18.515
Mm. Charlie.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.935
Let's write him a letter.
Let's write Frank a letter.

09:21.019 --> 09:23.270
That's the first step
in any intervention, right?

09:23.396 --> 09:25.064
Huh. Yeah.
Great. All right.

09:25.148 --> 09:27.191
So I'm assuming you'll have
to dictate yours to me,

09:27.317 --> 09:31.237
and then I'll just write it down for you, yeah?
Yes, that'll be fine.

09:31.321 --> 09:33.656
Okay, great.
Let's- Let's do that.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.242
Okay, uh, I guess
my letter would be about...

09:36.326 --> 09:39.245
how Frank and I aren't really making
memories together anymore,

09:39.329 --> 09:43.374
and how when we don't make memories
together, that's a hurtful thing for me.

09:43.458 --> 09:46.335
Okay. Uh, you know,
let's just dive right in.

09:46.419 --> 09:49.213
I'm not even gonna try and suss out
where you're going with that one.

09:49.297 --> 09:51.215
Right. Um, number one...

09:51.299 --> 09:54.551
when was the last time we played
Night Crawlers together, Frank?

09:54.636 --> 09:57.304
Oh. Oh, okay.
What is that?

09:57.389 --> 10:01.475
Well, it's not about you.
Why don't you just write it down, and then...

10:01.559 --> 10:05.020
Yeah, but you said it.
You said "Night Crawlers,"

10:05.105 --> 10:07.564
and now I feel like
I can't move past it.

10:07.691 --> 10:10.776
I gotta know what that is.
It's- It's no big deal.

10:10.860 --> 10:13.028
You know? I...

10:13.113 --> 10:15.864
If I were you, I'd just write it down
because it's not really a big deal.

10:15.991 --> 10:18.742
What is it?
It's what it sounds like.

10:18.827 --> 10:22.955
What it sounds like is that you two
crawl around like worms in the night.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.915
That's what it sounds like.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.835
[Smacks Lips] This is not about
you, so I'd like for you...

10:27.919 --> 10:30.170
- [Metal Banging]
- Damn! Shut up! Guess what!

10:30.297 --> 10:32.965
What? We got you!
What do you guys think?

10:33.049 --> 10:35.551
I thought when Frank comes in, we'll
just bang and make a bunch of noise.

10:35.677 --> 10:38.429
Oh, yeah. Ha!
We've got you! All right.

10:38.513 --> 10:40.431
But the pain is a little agitating.
That's overboard, I think.

10:40.515 --> 10:42.433
- [Dee] It's too much?
- I think that's too far.

10:42.517 --> 10:45.144
The yelling and pointing and accusing and
saying that he's trapped and surrounded...

10:45.228 --> 10:46.520
is probably gonna be-
That's gonna be great.

10:46.604 --> 10:49.106
By the way, you guys, can I
just say, as a side note,

10:49.190 --> 10:51.150
I am loving
this canned wine thing.

10:51.276 --> 10:52.818
I think it's brilliant.
Right?

10:52.902 --> 10:55.904
I'm active. I'm gesturing with my
hands, and I don't feel restricted.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.532
If I was holding a wine glass, I'd be
spilling wine all over the goddamn place.

10:58.616 --> 11:02.119
It would get everywhere. We're not intervening
on Frank for a lack of good ideas.

11:02.245 --> 11:05.831
Well, that's for sure. Oh, no.
Well, guys, maybe we're not doing the right thing.

11:05.915 --> 11:08.792
You're talking a lot about wine.
You got it all over your lips and teeth.

11:08.877 --> 11:12.212
Maybe we need the help of a professional.
We should probably get that lady back.

11:12.297 --> 11:14.340
What are you talking about?
We're coming up with all kinds of good ideas.

11:14.466 --> 11:16.508
We're flowing here.
I feel like we got some good stuff.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.594
I just feel like- Maybe we should
consult with the pamphlets, right?

11:18.720 --> 11:20.637
The pamphlets I grabbed from the office.
Oh, okay.

11:20.722 --> 11:22.181
Well, I've been meaning
to bring that up.

11:22.265 --> 11:24.058
I took a lot at those
pamphlets that you grabbed,

11:24.142 --> 11:26.268
and not a single one of them has
anything to do with intervention.

11:26.353 --> 11:29.313
It's not even close. I'm starting to
think we need to intervene on you...

11:29.439 --> 11:32.524
for your goddamn illiteracy.
Yeah, Charlie, you are getting real dumb.

11:32.609 --> 11:37.112
Come on. All right. See, this is
what I'm talking about. Illiteracy.

11:37.197 --> 11:40.699
What does that word even mean?
Come on.

11:40.784 --> 11:43.285
I'm gonna get the lady,
'cause this is gettin' crazy.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.871
We need help.
I'm gettin' the lady.

11:50.043 --> 11:53.045
[Sizzling]

11:56.424 --> 11:59.468
## [Humming]

12:00.553 --> 12:02.554
- Whoa.
- How you doin', Frank?

12:02.639 --> 12:04.390
What the hell
are you doing here?

12:04.474 --> 12:06.392
Frank, my plan
is finally coming together.

12:06.476 --> 12:09.395
With you out of the picture,
I can swoop in on Donna.

12:09.479 --> 12:11.522
Is that why you pushed me off
onto the Snail?

12:11.606 --> 12:14.149
Yeah, that's right, bitch.
But that's what you wanted anyway, right?

12:14.234 --> 12:16.151
You wanted to be
as depraved as possible.

12:16.236 --> 12:21.573
Yeah. But I think the Snail
is too depraved even for me.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.534
This broad is berserk.

12:23.660 --> 12:26.370
[Gail] Wake and bake.
You guys bang?

12:26.454 --> 12:31.875
Oh, no. We did a bunch of those Monster
Energy drinks and dry humped. It was awful.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.919
I think she gave me poison ivy.
[Grunts]

12:34.003 --> 12:36.922
Hey, hey there, sleepyhead.

12:37.006 --> 12:39.925
I made you breakfast.
I hope you like it crispy 'cause it is burned.

12:40.009 --> 12:43.554
What is going on in here?
How did you get in my house?

12:43.638 --> 12:45.681
Did you kick in my door?

12:45.765 --> 12:47.933
Kick, yes. Kick in, no.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.977
That door is solid,
which is the good news.

12:50.061 --> 12:52.771
The bad news
is the window is not.

12:52.856 --> 12:54.440
That's gonna be a security concern.
But don't worry.

12:54.524 --> 12:56.400
I'm gonna fix it,
make sure it's up to snuff.

12:56.526 --> 12:59.445
You're always safe when you're with me.
Are you ready for your breakfast?

12:59.529 --> 13:01.822
I'm sorry.
What is happening here?

13:01.948 --> 13:06.160
I haven't any idea, honestly.
I'm giving Frank a handy under the table.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.453
[Groans] That is true.

13:07.537 --> 13:09.872
Look, Snail- Back off.

13:09.956 --> 13:13.292
Because you're just
mashing it now. It's not...

13:13.376 --> 13:14.918
For God sakes, Gail.

13:15.003 --> 13:17.254
Mom, I'm sexually active now.
Get over it.

13:17.338 --> 13:19.965
You're 33 years old.
You're supposed to be sexually active.

13:20.049 --> 13:23.218
You're not supposed to be fondling
your uncle under a table.

13:23.344 --> 13:26.263
We're not blood related.
Will you just please leave her alone?

13:26.347 --> 13:30.309
I'll make a deal with you.
I dump the Snail if you and I go out.

13:30.393 --> 13:32.102
Frank, you can't do that.
Donna's my girl.

13:32.187 --> 13:34.146
I called her first at the funeral.
Fair is fair.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.315
Let me make something
perfectly clear.

13:36.399 --> 13:39.109
I will never be
with either of you.

13:39.194 --> 13:41.862
Why are you doing this to me?
Why can't you just let me be happy?

13:41.988 --> 13:43.447
I want everybody out of my house.
Jesus Christ.

13:43.573 --> 13:44.823
Out of my house!
Okay!

13:44.908 --> 13:46.992
- Fine.
- Not you. You live here, Gail.

13:47.076 --> 13:49.286
I hate it here. I'm leaving.
I'm going with this guy. He's my boyfriend.

13:49.370 --> 13:51.580
- I'm taking some eggs.
- I am not your boyfriend.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.208
Frank, what is with this chick?
She's berserk.

13:56.294 --> 13:58.837
Oh, okay. I get it.
So Frank sits there,

13:58.922 --> 14:00.923
and we put stools
in a semicircle.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.925
You wanna make sure there's
a border all around him...

14:03.051 --> 14:05.093
so there's no going anywhere.
And zing him from every angle.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.178
Yep.
Okay.

14:06.262 --> 14:08.472
- That makes sense.
- There she is!

14:08.598 --> 14:11.183
Hey! Hey!
Thank you for coming!

14:11.267 --> 14:14.728
- [Laughs] - We really appreciate this.
We really appreciate it.

14:14.812 --> 14:17.856
Well, I'm here because clearly your
friend is in desperate need of help.

14:17.941 --> 14:20.359
[All] Yeah, yeah, yeah!

14:20.443 --> 14:23.487
Well, we realize we also just need
as many people attacking this guy...

14:23.613 --> 14:24.988
as we can possibly get.
Mm-hmm.

14:25.073 --> 14:27.699
Well, not attacking.
This is why I'm glad you called me back.

14:27.784 --> 14:30.077
Yeah, okay, listen.
Before we get into that,

14:30.161 --> 14:33.330
could you help us pop a quick intervention
on Charlie for his illiteracy?

14:33.456 --> 14:35.374
The kid can't read or write.
Not a bit.

14:35.458 --> 14:38.252
- [Laughing] - No joke.
It's no joke.

14:38.336 --> 14:42.172
They've been riding me all day. I can read and write.
I just don't like to read and write.

14:42.257 --> 14:44.299
Let's try and stay focused on Frank.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.385
That's a good point.
He's gonna be here any second.

14:46.469 --> 14:48.428
We told him there was
a giant grease fire...

14:48.513 --> 14:52.140
- and he had to come down immediately.
- [Charlie, Dennis Chuckling]

14:52.267 --> 14:55.602
Uh-oh. She's- I'm assuming you wouldn't
have lured him down with a fire.

14:55.687 --> 14:57.604
Is that what your face
is doing right now?

14:57.689 --> 15:01.233
Yeah. Um, and I wouldn't
have an intervention at a bar either.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.652
[Laughing] Well, lady, look,

15:03.736 --> 15:06.863
all mistakes we've made on our own,
so it's good that you're here.

15:06.948 --> 15:08.323
We're doing our best.
We're doing our best.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.783
Where's the goddamn fire?
[Gun Cocks]

15:09.867 --> 15:13.287
Intervention! Intervention!
Ah, intervention!

15:13.413 --> 15:16.540
Intervention! I got it! I got it!
You're surrounded, Frank!

15:16.624 --> 15:19.585
There's nowhere for you to go.
You're trapped. You're trapped.

15:19.669 --> 15:21.712
[All Chanting] You're trapped!
You're trapped!

15:21.838 --> 15:23.547
Got you! Got you!
You're trapped!

15:23.631 --> 15:26.550
- That's enough! That's enough!
- We told you there was gonna be a gun.

15:26.676 --> 15:28.844
What the hell's going on?
Got you, man!

15:28.970 --> 15:31.680
Sit down! You sit down so we can tell
you what an asshole you've been.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.890
We're gonna get all in your
face and point out your faults.

15:33.975 --> 15:37.227
A roast? I've always
wanted to be roasted.

15:37.312 --> 15:40.314
Oh, wait. Let me just
switch gears here...

15:40.398 --> 15:42.316
fire up this spliff.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.401
No, no, no, no.
Wait. Frank, hold on.

15:44.485 --> 15:48.989
Um, everyone's here today because they care
about you and they want you to get well.

15:49.073 --> 15:51.950
She ain't funny. Next.

15:52.076 --> 15:53.952
Frank, you're an asshole.
Ah! That's it.

15:54.037 --> 15:56.496
- Now rain down on me.
Come on. - You're a prick!

15:56.581 --> 15:58.957
And your addiction has affected
us in the following ways.

15:59.042 --> 16:00.959
You are annoying!

16:01.044 --> 16:04.004
Dennis, come on!
Give it to me with both barrels!

16:04.130 --> 16:09.426
Why do we never play Night Crawlers anymore, huh?
I don't know, Charlie.

16:09.552 --> 16:13.138
What is Night Crawlers? It's a game where
they crawl around in the night like worms.

16:13.264 --> 16:15.974
I never said that.
Yeah, well, that's what it is.

16:16.059 --> 16:18.685
Intervention! Intervention!
Is nothing private, Frank?

16:18.770 --> 16:22.648
Jesus! Look, I like that game.
I don't wanna stop playing it.

16:22.732 --> 16:24.775
Well, Charlie,
we can play that game.

16:24.901 --> 16:25.942
You promise?
Yeah.

16:26.069 --> 16:27.736
Whoo! Ahh!
Yeah.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.738
Stop touching me.
[Speaks, Indistinct]

16:29.822 --> 16:32.074
- [Mac] Just stop.
- [Dee] Whoa! What's this?

16:32.158 --> 16:33.825
Me and Mac are together.

16:33.910 --> 16:35.077
No! No!
No!

16:35.203 --> 16:37.496
Intervention! Intervention!
Intervention!

16:37.580 --> 16:39.498
What are you
interventioning me for?

16:39.582 --> 16:41.208
Because you can't
be banging Gail the Snail.

16:41.292 --> 16:43.794
I'm not banging Gail the Snail.
She followed me home.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.296
[Slurps] Oh!
She was doing that the whole time.

16:46.422 --> 16:49.841
[Dee] Yeah, she does that.
Swallow it or spit it out.

16:49.926 --> 16:51.259
No, don't!
Oh, my God.

16:51.386 --> 16:52.678
See?
Intervention!

16:52.762 --> 16:54.638
Hey, babe, I'll get you
a drink from the bar.

16:54.764 --> 16:56.223
Great. My God.
What are you doing, Mac?

16:56.307 --> 16:58.975
I was just going over to her
house to try and bang Donna...

16:59.060 --> 17:01.144
because she reminds me
so much of your mom,

17:01.229 --> 17:02.521
which is
the best sex I ever had.

17:02.605 --> 17:04.815
- [Groans] - Intervention.
Intervention.

17:04.941 --> 17:07.733
[Mac] Huh?
You banged my dead wife?

17:07.819 --> 17:10.654
Well, she was alive
at the time.

17:10.738 --> 17:13.949
- But- Did you not know that?
- No.

17:14.032 --> 17:17.327
It's cool, man. It's cool.
Intervention. Intervention. Okay?

17:17.412 --> 17:21.373
Look, he's got a weird fetish for older
women, so don't hold it against him.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.750
I don't have
an older-woman fetish.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.292
Yeah, you do.
I don't wanna bang this chick.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.128
Let's cool it with the
intervention stuff for a second...

17:27.213 --> 17:29.214
'cause there's a lot of 'em
being thrown around right now,

17:29.298 --> 17:30.882
and I'm having a little bit
of trouble keeping track.

17:30.967 --> 17:33.260
The most important intervention is the
one we need to do on Gail the Snail...

17:33.344 --> 17:34.553
and getting her
out of our lives.

17:34.637 --> 17:37.305
Guys, let's do shots
and get crazy.

17:37.432 --> 17:40.100
No, Gail. No. We're intervening on you, Snail.
Go. Get out of here.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.269
Yeah, right.
How is she not getting this?

17:42.395 --> 17:45.522
She's stonewalling us.
It is a classic Snail technique. Classic.

17:45.648 --> 17:47.983
Ya! Get out of here, Snail!
[Dennis] He's got the salt!

17:48.109 --> 17:50.068
Salt the Snail!
Ya, ya, ya!

17:50.153 --> 17:52.904
Go, Snail!
Ya, ya, ya!

17:53.030 --> 17:55.282
Ya! Ya!
Hey, guys! Guys, guys!

17:55.366 --> 17:58.076
I was gonna invite you guys
all to a rave to hang out,

17:58.161 --> 18:00.036
but now I don't wanna
hang out with you anymore.

18:00.163 --> 18:02.122
Oh, my God. Salt the Snail.
Just salt her.

18:02.206 --> 18:03.665
Wait, wait!
Do you guys wanna go?

18:03.791 --> 18:05.667
No, no! We don't wanna go!
Wait!

18:05.752 --> 18:07.377
I have glow sticks.

18:07.462 --> 18:09.504
Salt the Snail!
[All Shouting]

18:09.589 --> 18:10.922
[Dee] The whole thing!

18:11.007 --> 18:14.509
- Ya, ya, ya!
- What is with that broad?

18:14.594 --> 18:17.554
She is the worst, right?
That's what we've been saying.

18:17.638 --> 18:20.140
Oh, my God. That was a terrible
experience for me by the way.

18:20.224 --> 18:23.101
Of course it was. Nobody likes salting
the Snail, but she gives you no choice.

18:23.186 --> 18:26.104
- She doesn't leave you with any options.
- What a horrible thing.

18:26.189 --> 18:28.190
I'm all worked up now.
I feel bad.

18:28.274 --> 18:31.151
I feel like maybe I should have
some more wine in a can.

18:31.277 --> 18:33.737
I'll get you one. I can use some
canned wine to calm down a little bit.

18:33.821 --> 18:34.905
Oh, you guys are drinking
wine out of those cans?

18:34.906 --> 18:35.947
Oh, you guys are drinking
wine out of those cans?

18:36.032 --> 18:37.908
Hell, yeah, baby.
Hell, yeah.

18:38.034 --> 18:41.411
Can I have one? Yes, and you will notice
the advantages almost immediately.

18:41.537 --> 18:43.330
Here. Try this.
I feel like drinking wine out of a can...

18:43.414 --> 18:46.208
is conducive to my violent
hand gestures when I speak.

18:46.334 --> 18:48.210
You tend to be very emphatic and
strong and- There's no spillage.

18:48.336 --> 18:50.337
Say I wanna give one to Frank.
You didn't get any on me.

18:50.463 --> 18:53.381
I spilled a little.
You wanna point accusatorily, but...

18:53.466 --> 18:54.883
But it really boosts
your mobility.

18:54.967 --> 18:58.386
Excuse me.
Excuse- Excuse me.

18:58.471 --> 19:02.808
People, I- I'm sorry, but how do
you guys wanna proceed from here?

19:02.892 --> 19:04.476
Because I'm a little confused.

19:04.560 --> 19:06.311
Ohh!

19:06.395 --> 19:08.313
Did you wanna-
Right. Okay.

19:08.397 --> 19:12.317
Um- Well, I guess we kind of got what
we needed out of the intervention.

19:12.401 --> 19:14.027
Yeah.
Right? So good job.

19:14.111 --> 19:16.112
Was it? Did she?
We did all the work, didn't we?

19:16.197 --> 19:18.824
So we can't really
pay you 'cause of that.

19:18.950 --> 19:21.660
I know we said we would,
but we won't. Yeah.

19:21.786 --> 19:24.871
Um, how about a can of wine?
[Dennis] Oh.

19:27.166 --> 19:30.252
[Scoffs] No.

19:30.378 --> 19:33.046
Oh.
All right. Well...

19:33.172 --> 19:34.548
Okay, well, on your way.
Adios.

19:34.632 --> 19:35.757
On your way then.
Take your jacket.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.092
Get out of here.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.677
Take that shoulder-padded
jacket and get the hell out.

19:38.761 --> 19:40.136
Thanks for stopping by.

19:40.221 --> 19:41.805
Don't expect
a check in the mail.

19:41.931 --> 19:43.098
Hey!
Up top!

19:43.224 --> 19:44.599
Up top, everybody!
[Dee] Great intervention!

19:44.725 --> 19:46.560
Great intervention!
Great intervention work!
