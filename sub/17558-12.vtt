WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:05.306
BRYAN:
Like any other red-blooded
American 12-year-old boy,

00:05.339 --> 00:07.908
there was one magazine
I was always obsessed with.

00:07.941 --> 00:10.244
Ladies' Home Journal.

00:10.278 --> 00:13.314
And today,
LHJ is interviewing me.

00:13.347 --> 00:14.982
They want to hear my thoughts

00:15.015 --> 00:16.650
about the issues
that matter most.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.519
And that's why I like gloves.

00:18.552 --> 00:20.254
(laughing)

00:20.288 --> 00:23.657
Okay, now let's dig a little
deeper into Bryan Collins

00:23.691 --> 00:24.858
and talk
about family.

00:24.892 --> 00:26.094
You and your partner

00:26.127 --> 00:27.428
are expecting your first child.

00:27.461 --> 00:29.029
Congratulations.

00:29.063 --> 00:31.165
Have you always wanted a baby?
Oh, are you kidding?

00:31.199 --> 00:32.666
My mom said I used to try

00:32.700 --> 00:33.867
to breast-feed
my Stretch Armstrong doll.

00:33.901 --> 00:35.869
(laughter)

00:35.903 --> 00:37.671
Recently you said on Twitter

00:37.705 --> 00:40.841
that you believe that men, like
women, have a biological clock.

00:40.874 --> 00:43.877
That is true, and the clock
can start ticking at any time.

00:43.911 --> 00:46.180
I mean, look at Brad Pitt.
His biological clock

00:46.214 --> 00:48.116
went off, and a year later,
he had half a dozen kids.

00:48.149 --> 00:49.350
(laughter)

00:49.383 --> 00:51.352
But some men are born
without a clock.

00:51.385 --> 00:52.620
Uh, for example,

00:52.653 --> 00:54.054
my ex-boyfriend.

00:54.088 --> 00:56.857
(grunting)

00:56.890 --> 00:58.226
Is this 70 or 80?

00:58.259 --> 01:00.528
I don't count. I just watch.
Hey, why are you

01:00.561 --> 01:02.563
packing clothes? We're not gonna
need 'em for Mardi Gras.

01:02.596 --> 01:03.797
You know what, Monty? No.

01:03.831 --> 01:04.798
What do you mean, "No"?

01:04.832 --> 01:05.899
Just no. I...

01:05.933 --> 01:07.034
I promised myself

01:07.067 --> 01:08.636
I was gonna stay here
this weekend

01:08.669 --> 01:10.404
and finish
my Smallvill spec script,

01:10.438 --> 01:11.739
and if I get on
that plane with you,

01:11.772 --> 01:13.541
the whole weekend's
just gonna be filled

01:13.574 --> 01:15.643
with booze and debauchery,
and I'm gonna end up

01:15.676 --> 01:17.545
black-out drunk trying to flash
my boobs to a film crew.

01:17.578 --> 01:20.214
Yeah.
That sounds so much better
than my lame Smallville script.

01:20.248 --> 01:21.215
Ah, come on, babe.

01:21.249 --> 01:22.483
Write it on the plane.

01:22.516 --> 01:23.984
It's, like,
a three-hour flight.

01:24.017 --> 01:26.287
I'm gonna get so drunk
on teeny bottles of vodka.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.055
Monty. Monty, Monty, no! Monty!

01:28.088 --> 01:29.990
Monty, don't you have goals?

01:30.023 --> 01:31.759
Yeah. Mardi Gras, drunk!

01:31.792 --> 01:33.060
No. Didn't you hear me?

01:33.093 --> 01:35.563
I want to talk
about our future.
All right.

01:35.596 --> 01:39.567
When you picture us living in
a beautiful palapa by the sea...

01:39.600 --> 01:41.101
Yeah, surfing
rules, babe.

01:41.135 --> 01:42.570
I know.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.071
Do you imagine us
with children?

01:44.104 --> 01:47.241
What do you mean? Like, native
children deboning fish for us?

01:47.275 --> 01:48.609
(laughing):
No.

01:48.642 --> 01:51.279
I mean, if you could say
the perfect number of kids

01:51.312 --> 01:52.280
for us to have,
it would be...
Oh.

01:52.313 --> 01:53.847
Wait. Think of the number,

01:53.881 --> 01:56.584
and then we'll say it
at the same time. Ready? Go.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.252
Three!
Zero!

01:58.286 --> 01:59.620
But now my life
is completely different.

01:59.653 --> 02:02.290
Now I have a partner who wants
a family as badly as I do.

02:02.323 --> 02:05.125
Oh, well, do you and your fiancé
plan on having more children?

02:05.159 --> 02:06.460
Absolutely.

02:06.494 --> 02:09.129
When?

02:10.798 --> 02:13.100
Let's get back to gloves.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.468
Uh-huh.

02:14.502 --> 02:16.937
That Ladies' Home Journal woman

02:16.970 --> 02:18.606
would not stop badgering me.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.808
"Are you gonna have
more kids? How many?

02:20.841 --> 02:22.176
What's your family
gonna look like?"

02:22.210 --> 02:24.011
It was so accepting,
it was alienating.

02:24.044 --> 02:25.479
She's right, though.

02:25.513 --> 02:28.115
Family planning has a lot more
variables for couples like us.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.284
We have to know
how many kids we want,

02:30.318 --> 02:31.785
how far to space them apart,

02:31.819 --> 02:33.321
whose sperm we'll use,

02:33.354 --> 02:34.622
got to lock down an egg donor.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.123
And we have to
make it all happen

02:36.156 --> 02:37.725
before we get too old.

02:37.758 --> 02:40.228
Ugh, David, that list
was the opposite of sexy.

02:40.261 --> 02:42.129
Straight couples
have it so easy.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.832
The only family planning they
have to do is a bottle of cab,

02:44.865 --> 02:46.234
a French toast-scented candle

02:46.267 --> 02:48.402
and a Netflix stream
of Y Tu Mamá También.

02:48.436 --> 02:50.504
Okay, well, let's talk about it.

02:50.538 --> 02:51.805
Um, we know
we want more than one.

02:51.839 --> 02:52.973
Nothing wrong
with an only,

02:53.006 --> 02:54.141
but I'd like to have my option

02:54.174 --> 02:55.309
of having a favorite.

02:55.343 --> 02:56.644
Two is great,

02:56.677 --> 02:58.912
but so many wonderful
things come in threes.

02:58.946 --> 03:02.683
Little pigs, Jonas Brothers,
celebrity deaths.

03:02.716 --> 03:05.018
Maybe we want to field
our own basketball team.

03:05.052 --> 03:06.587
That's five,
by the way.
Really?

03:06.620 --> 03:08.989
Okay, if you had to
say the ideal number

03:09.022 --> 03:11.091
of kids for us to have,
what would it be?

03:11.124 --> 03:12.826
Just think of the number,
and then we'll both

03:12.860 --> 03:14.828
say it at the same time.
Okay.

03:14.862 --> 03:17.498
Ready? And go. Three!
Three!

03:17.531 --> 03:19.199
BOTH:
I love you so much.

03:23.704 --> 03:26.006
Okay, name the six
fiduciary duties

03:26.039 --> 03:28.175
of a California
real estate agent.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.510
What are you doing here,
Goggles?

03:29.543 --> 03:30.778
Mom dropped me off.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.880
She's off to Chinatown
to buy some new fabric.

03:32.913 --> 03:35.383
Chinatown? The only thing
she's gonna find in Chinatown

03:35.416 --> 03:38.018
are bad drivers
and future violinists.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.953
Now, get over here.
I haven't had

03:39.987 --> 03:42.723
any Shania hugs lately.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.358
There you go.

03:44.392 --> 03:47.027
Girl, that's a sad face
if I've ever seen one.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.363
Did your nana's racism
offend you, too?

03:49.397 --> 03:50.864
No, I don't even hear it
anymore.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.032
It's just that

03:52.065 --> 03:53.734
some girls
at school were mean to me.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.236
(giggling)

03:56.270 --> 03:58.038
Do you mind if I sit here?

03:58.071 --> 03:59.039
Aw, sorry,

03:59.072 --> 04:00.040
but we're busy

04:00.073 --> 04:01.542
updating our Facebook homepages.

04:01.575 --> 04:02.643
We're posting
an overhead

04:02.676 --> 04:03.811
picture of you taking

04:03.844 --> 04:05.546
a hellacious number two
after math.

04:05.579 --> 04:06.880
See the pretty,
soft border?

04:06.914 --> 04:07.915
Instagram rocks.

04:07.948 --> 04:08.982
That's not true.

04:09.016 --> 04:10.083
That's not me.

04:10.117 --> 04:11.251
I only poop at home.

04:11.285 --> 04:12.486
Good luck trying
to prove that,

04:12.520 --> 04:13.220
Debbie Dumper.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.254
You stink.

04:14.288 --> 04:15.656
(laughter)

04:15.689 --> 04:17.257
Never lay your crossed eyes
on us again,

04:17.291 --> 04:18.926
because you'll never
be friends with us

04:18.959 --> 04:20.728
or anybody ever.

04:20.761 --> 04:21.895
(laughter)

04:21.929 --> 04:25.499
Shania, you need to shut
those bitches down now,

04:25.533 --> 04:27.401
or your self-esteem
is shot for life.

04:27.435 --> 04:28.902
Rocky is 100% right.

04:28.936 --> 04:32.906
What you need is a plan for
total and complete dominance.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.408
And this isn't just for now.

04:34.442 --> 04:37.678
You need to learn how to conquer
mean girls throughout adulthood

04:37.711 --> 04:39.413
so that you can become

04:39.447 --> 04:43.951
a strong, aspirational woman
like me and your nana.

04:43.984 --> 04:45.085
I don't understand.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.921
Shania, women are always
at war in this world,

04:47.955 --> 04:49.423
especially against
each other.

04:49.457 --> 04:52.092
Now, your nana
is going to make sure

04:52.125 --> 04:54.595
you have the right uniform...

04:54.628 --> 04:57.264
and weapon... for battle.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.432
So, here's our plan.

04:58.466 --> 04:59.767
We'd love to have
three children,

04:59.800 --> 05:01.535
ideally spaced
two years apart,

05:01.569 --> 05:03.036
with the second
child using his...

05:03.070 --> 05:05.138
My dollop of me.
Very polite.

05:05.172 --> 05:06.440
And for our third child,

05:06.474 --> 05:07.775
we would love to mix

05:07.808 --> 05:08.942
our genetic matter,

05:08.976 --> 05:10.110
letting 'em duke it out.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.612
Yes. Father Time
is ticking away,

05:11.645 --> 05:13.213
and we don't want
to be those sad old dads

05:13.246 --> 05:14.482
in the high-waisted slacks

05:14.515 --> 05:16.116
hobbling to kindergarten
graduation.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.451
Like Al Pacino.

05:17.485 --> 05:18.652
Hoo-ha!

05:18.686 --> 05:20.388
(laughs)

05:20.421 --> 05:22.222
(crying)

05:22.255 --> 05:23.791
Gary, what's wrong?

05:23.824 --> 05:25.325
I'm going to die alone.

05:25.359 --> 05:26.794
Well, that was a sudden turn.

05:26.827 --> 05:29.229
That's what it means
to be bipolar!

05:29.262 --> 05:33.000
I'm sorry. It's just all this
talk of dollops and Al Pacino.

05:33.033 --> 05:35.302
I want what
you guys have.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.805
I want love and a family
and sweet-ass cars,

05:37.838 --> 05:40.007
and sassy
African-American assistants.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.342
I have dedicated my life
to putting together

05:42.376 --> 05:43.911
families because
I've always wanted one.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.646
But it's never
going to happen.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.681
I'm too old to meet anyone.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.650
(blows nose)
I've been on eHarmony

05:49.683 --> 05:52.219
and JDate,
but for some reason,

05:52.252 --> 05:54.087
I just get paired with losers.

05:54.121 --> 05:58.926
And then, at age six,
I learned I'm intersex.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.994
All I want is a family.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.496
I'm running out of time here.

06:02.530 --> 06:04.865
What if we fixed Gary up
with your ex, Monty?

06:04.898 --> 06:06.199
Oh.

06:06.233 --> 06:08.836
No? I mean, when we bumped
into him a few months ago,

06:08.869 --> 06:10.671
it seemed like he was
ready to settle down.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.372
Bryan. David.

06:12.406 --> 06:13.607
Monty.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.275
Yeah.
Great to see you.

06:15.308 --> 06:17.210
Guess some things
never change.

06:17.244 --> 06:19.046
Still rocking the
roller skates, I see.

06:19.079 --> 06:21.682
Blades.
Blades. Isn't
this place amazing?

06:21.715 --> 06:24.452
I mean, look at this. It's
cantaloupe in its original form.

06:24.485 --> 06:26.954
I thought it only came in little
chunks on the end of toothpicks.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.789
It's wild, right?
Wild.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.190
Surprised
to see you here.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.391
I thought you usually have

06:31.425 --> 06:33.026
a team of boy toys do
your shopping for you.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.962
No, no. I've whittled
it down to just two.

06:34.995 --> 06:37.197
I want to set a good
example for my kid.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.467
Wait. You have a kid?
Not yet, but I want to.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.635
I know, I know. I used
to be the king of,

06:41.669 --> 06:43.203
"Gay means never having
to say I'm pregnant."

06:43.236 --> 06:45.405
But then, I just realized,
it's time for me to grow up.

06:45.439 --> 06:46.974
I want my own family.

06:47.007 --> 06:49.810
Now I just need to find the
right man. You know anyone?

06:49.843 --> 06:52.245
If the guy's got a pulse,
I'm in.

06:52.279 --> 06:55.315
Hell, if he doesn't,
it wouldn't be the first time.

07:02.456 --> 07:04.057
You've been studying
hard lately, Jane.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.559
You deserve a reward.

07:05.593 --> 07:07.394
Google "Jon Hamm
plus moose knuckle,"

07:07.427 --> 07:09.429
and thank me
later.
(sighs quietly)

07:09.463 --> 07:12.566
Well, that doesn't look
like the twisted grin

07:12.600 --> 07:15.235
of a girl who just squashed
her first enemies.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.369
The suit didn't work.

07:20.541 --> 07:21.742
I demand to sit with you!

07:21.775 --> 07:23.911
There is no reason why
I should be excluded,

07:23.944 --> 07:26.346
and I will not be disrespected
any longer.

07:26.379 --> 07:29.583
As you can see by my outfit,
I mean business.

07:29.617 --> 07:30.417
(giggling)

07:30.450 --> 07:31.351
Oh, my God.

07:31.384 --> 07:32.352
It's Lindsay Lohan

07:32.385 --> 07:33.420
when she has
to show up for court.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.922
My mom used
to dress like that

07:34.955 --> 07:37.090
before she read
50 Shades of Grey.

07:37.124 --> 07:40.160
(laughter)

07:40.193 --> 07:41.929
I'm shocked.
Really, the Nancy Reagan

07:41.962 --> 07:44.131
red always works for me.

07:44.164 --> 07:46.667
Of course
it didn't work.

07:46.700 --> 07:47.935
It's not about the suit.

07:47.968 --> 07:51.038
Shania, girls like that
don't respond to reason.

07:51.071 --> 07:53.641
They respond to reading.

07:53.674 --> 07:55.442
Now, if you
want the power,

07:55.475 --> 07:56.610
you got to go in there

07:56.644 --> 07:59.446
and read those girls
and take it!

07:59.479 --> 08:00.614
Read, like, books?

08:00.648 --> 08:01.982
Mm-hmm.
Hell, no.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.784
Reading is a time-honored manner

08:03.817 --> 08:06.453
of cutting someone down
with your words.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.623
Oh, like the drags taught us
in West Hollywood.

08:09.657 --> 08:10.958
Correct.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.793
Reading is an
oral tradition

08:12.826 --> 08:14.795
passed down through
generations of queens.

08:14.828 --> 08:17.464
It's all about obtaining power
through insult

08:17.497 --> 08:20.300
by focusing in on someone's
flaws and putting them on blast.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.970
Speaking of flaws, I noticed
your crow's feet are showing.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.906
Did the 99-Cent Store run out
of your wrinkle cream again?

08:25.939 --> 08:29.409
Or did your eyes request a road
map to your receding wig line?

08:29.442 --> 08:32.145
My eyes are fine.
For example,

08:32.179 --> 08:35.315
they can see that you've been
packing on the pounds.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.250
That cushion-for-the-pushin'
is so big, it's part

08:37.284 --> 08:39.352
of a 12-piece sectional!

08:39.386 --> 08:40.988
Reading.

08:41.021 --> 08:42.222
A necessity of life.

08:42.255 --> 08:44.157
Give half-pint some
more pointers, ladies.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.159
You so big and fat,

08:46.193 --> 08:49.196
you need to use the Eiffel Tower
like a toothpick.

08:49.229 --> 08:51.198
Girl, you're so haggard and old,

08:51.231 --> 08:54.668
your first pet was a T. rex.

08:54.702 --> 08:56.737
Okay, so all I have to do
to dominate

08:56.770 --> 08:59.840
and win the respect of my peers
is snap my fingers like this?

08:59.873 --> 09:02.509
Yes, honey, and head
like a propeller.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.511
Head.
Now put it all together.

09:04.544 --> 09:05.679
Put your back into it!

09:05.713 --> 09:08.515
Read!
Back in... back into it! Yeah!

09:08.548 --> 09:11.384
And by the end of the
summer, thanks to me,

09:11.418 --> 09:13.721
the Greek island of Naxos
had house music.

09:13.754 --> 09:16.724
Uh, but Monty, that's not really
how you live anymore, right?

09:16.757 --> 09:18.558
I mean, you were telling me
how you're very serious

09:18.592 --> 09:21.194
about settling down?
Yeah, I am done with

09:21.228 --> 09:22.529
that whole lifestyle.
I mean, it gets tired,

09:22.562 --> 09:25.198
jetting off to Prague
every weekend with Frank Ocean.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.534
Love him.
Love "Caribbean Queen."

09:27.567 --> 09:29.703
That kind of stuff used to be
the big perk of being gay.

09:29.737 --> 09:32.039
You could just keep the party
going your whole life.

09:32.072 --> 09:35.743
Now, thank God, some of us are
growing up and giving back.

09:35.776 --> 09:37.477
I'm ready to start
planning a family.

09:37.510 --> 09:40.047
I mean, I tell people
that I'm 30.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.249
Well, we couldn't
recommend it enough.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.317
Bryan and I
have decided

09:44.351 --> 09:47.054
that we're going to have two
more kids after our baby comes.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.922
Oh.
See, a beautiful family.

09:48.956 --> 09:51.224
That's what I want
right there. Boom.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.761
Boom!
Just got to find
the right guy.

09:53.794 --> 09:55.896
DAVID:
Mmm.
Who's got two thumbs

09:55.929 --> 09:57.164
and no gag reflex? This guy.

10:01.368 --> 10:04.171
Hi. Sorry. I just got to
get some more paper towels.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.438
Oh, it's okay.
Uh, this is Goldie.

10:05.472 --> 10:07.775
She's our surrogate
and our very close friend.

10:07.808 --> 10:09.076
I'm dying fabric
in the guest house,

10:09.109 --> 10:10.343
and it's a little messy.

10:10.377 --> 10:12.245
Totally unrelated, Bryan--
that lambskin throw?

10:12.279 --> 10:14.081
That's Scotchgarded, right?

10:14.114 --> 10:15.916
May I touch your belly?

10:15.949 --> 10:17.184
Do you mind?

10:17.217 --> 10:18.418
Oh, uh... sure.

10:18.451 --> 10:21.454
I have never touched
a pregnant belly before.

10:21.488 --> 10:23.090
Hmm.
It's so hard.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.591
Mmm.
And there's a baby
growing inside.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.493
Right there in your belly.

10:26.526 --> 10:28.662
I got a belly, too,
and you can touch it,

10:28.696 --> 10:31.131
but I warn you-- I'm very
ticklish... and shaved.

10:31.164 --> 10:32.432
(Goldie laughs)

10:32.465 --> 10:34.768
I'm sure people tell you this
all the time, but

10:34.802 --> 10:36.036
you are very good-looking,
and yes,

10:36.069 --> 10:38.105
I know that you're gay.
My point is...

10:38.138 --> 10:39.306
This is a very confusing
moment for me.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.374
Man, being so close
to human life

10:41.408 --> 10:42.810
like this-- everything else

10:42.843 --> 10:44.644
seems... pointless.

10:44.678 --> 10:46.980
I had that exact thought
when I had my daughter.

10:47.014 --> 10:48.281
You have a daughter?

10:48.315 --> 10:50.217
GOLDIE:
Mm-hmm. Shania.
She's nine.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.819
MONTY:
I love the name Shania.
I saw Shania Twain

10:51.852 --> 10:54.888
twice when I was
living in London.
Oh, I love England.

10:54.922 --> 10:56.123
(bad British accent):
Hello, Governor.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.557
Blimey. Would you like
a cup of tea?

10:57.590 --> 10:58.658
That's so good.

10:58.692 --> 10:59.793
Hey, do you mind
if I come back

10:59.827 --> 11:01.061
and watch you
do your thing?

11:01.094 --> 11:03.496
Maybe you can give me a
crash course in surrogacy.

11:03.530 --> 11:04.631
Come on!

11:04.664 --> 11:06.633
I used to collect
Franklin Mint plates

11:06.666 --> 11:08.335
of Prince Charles
and Lady Di.

11:08.368 --> 11:10.470
Oh, God, why did I say that?

11:10.503 --> 11:11.504
I'm so stupid.

11:16.176 --> 11:19.713
I'm... I'm sure Monty
will be back any minute.

11:19.747 --> 11:22.750
It's been over an hour.
What are they doing in there?

11:22.783 --> 11:24.351
Oh, my God, Goldie.

11:24.384 --> 11:26.019
These are amazing.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.821
I mean, they're
so Drew Barrymore...

11:27.855 --> 11:30.490
pre-Jewish art dealer
and post-Strokes drummer.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.493
Oh, you could totally
write for Wikipedia.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.594
Really?
Yeah.

11:37.898 --> 11:40.500
Bryan, David,
thank you guys so much

11:40.533 --> 11:41.869
for inviting me over.

11:41.902 --> 11:44.004
If you hadn't, I never
would have met Goldie,

11:44.037 --> 11:46.506
and I never would have
figured out my plan.
Uh, what plan is that?

11:46.539 --> 11:48.508
Well, just because I haven't
met the right guy yet

11:48.541 --> 11:49.877
shouldn't stop me
from my dreams.

11:49.910 --> 11:52.279
I've decided, I'm gonna
pull a Sandra Bullock

11:52.312 --> 11:54.014
and move ahead
without a partner.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.382
I'm gonna have
a baby by myself.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.684
He'd rather have
no one than me.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.187
To family planning.
All you need to do now is

12:00.220 --> 12:01.889
find yourself
an egg donor and a surrogate.

12:01.922 --> 12:04.524
Well, I can already cross one
of those things off the list.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.960
I asked Goldie to
be my surrogate.

12:06.994 --> 12:09.396
*

12:14.501 --> 12:16.203
I can't believe your
ex-boyfriend has the nerve

12:16.236 --> 12:17.704
to try to steal
our surrogate.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.272
And it's so like Monty, too--
we invite him

12:19.306 --> 12:20.707
into our home,
try to fix him up,

12:20.740 --> 12:22.910
but no matter what he gets
in life, he always wants more.

12:23.911 --> 12:25.545
Well, Goldie is
our surrogate.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.747
I say we go over there,
we knock down his door

12:27.781 --> 12:29.149
and we tell him to back off.

12:29.182 --> 12:30.650
Knock down his door?

12:30.683 --> 12:32.552
Yeah. Well,
knock down, knock on.

12:32.585 --> 12:36.156
Even if there's a doorbell,
I say we push it hard.

12:36.189 --> 12:38.058
Well, this is gonna be
a first for Monty.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.960
I don't think anyone's
ever said no to him.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.494
(chuckling):
Certainly not me.

12:41.528 --> 12:44.664
I mean, I don't remember
anybody before you.

12:45.933 --> 12:48.401
WOMAN (on video):
I'm selling my eggs,

12:48.435 --> 12:50.337
'cause I believe everybody--

12:50.370 --> 12:53.073
married, single,
straight or gay--

12:53.106 --> 12:55.408
who wants a baby deserves
the chance to have one.

12:55.442 --> 12:58.245
Plus, Taylor Swift
is coming to town,

12:58.278 --> 13:00.180
and ticket prices are insane!

13:00.213 --> 13:03.583
So please buy my eggs,
or I'll die! Die.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.019
DAVID:
Hello. Where is he? Monty!

13:06.053 --> 13:08.088
Where are you?
Oh, hey, guys.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.357
I was just looking at
potential egg donors.

13:10.390 --> 13:13.293
There are a lot of
whack jobs out there.

13:13.326 --> 13:14.761
Hey, what donor number
did you guys use?

13:14.794 --> 13:17.464
No. No way. That is exactly
why we need to talk to you.

13:17.497 --> 13:20.267
Right after you
put your shirt on.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.435
David, there's no time.
We're here to yell at you.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.837
Yell at me?
Mm-hmm.

13:23.871 --> 13:27.107
For what?
You think you can just
blade into our lives

13:27.140 --> 13:29.109
with your
ridiculously toned abs

13:29.142 --> 13:31.644
that would make Mario Lopez
feel premenstrual,

13:31.678 --> 13:33.613
and just buy
whatever you want?

13:33.646 --> 13:34.882
You can't buy everything.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.616
Goldie is not for sale.

13:36.649 --> 13:39.619
Of course she is.
How'd you guys meet
her in the first place?

13:39.652 --> 13:42.155
Maybe she doesn't have
a "for lease" sign
nailed to her vagina,

13:42.189 --> 13:44.457
'cause that would
hurt an awful lot,
but that's what she is:

13:44.491 --> 13:46.493
a blonde incubator
who's cool and fun to be around.

13:46.526 --> 13:48.561
And what's the price on that?
'Cause I'll pay triple.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.063
Hey! Back off!

13:50.097 --> 13:52.565
Whoa.
Goldie is our friend.
She's practically our family.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.367
She's gonna have
our other kids, too.

13:54.401 --> 13:55.535
Really?
Yeah.

13:55.568 --> 13:56.736
'Cause I don't think
she knows that.

13:56.769 --> 13:59.172
And you guys blame me
for trying to buy her,

13:59.206 --> 14:01.808
but at least I had the respect
to ask what her plans are

14:01.841 --> 14:03.410
for her future-- and
I barely know her.

14:03.443 --> 14:04.611
What's your excuse?

14:07.347 --> 14:09.216
(girls giggling)

14:09.249 --> 14:10.918
Oh, no, no, no.

14:10.951 --> 14:13.987
Did the janitor get arrested
for selling meth again?

14:14.021 --> 14:16.990
'Cause there is trash
all over the schoolyard.

14:17.024 --> 14:19.159
Who are you calling trash,
you four-eyed Hobbit?

14:19.192 --> 14:21.728
Girl, you're the one
showing off those fugly feet

14:21.761 --> 14:23.096
in your Rite-Aid flip-flops,

14:23.130 --> 14:26.199
with your weird pinky toes
that point at 90-degree angles.

14:26.233 --> 14:28.835
It looks like your feet
are trying to hitch a ride.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.171
And, Jenna, you need
to shave that big head, girl,

14:31.204 --> 14:33.706
'cause either you got the lice
or the dandruff,

14:33.740 --> 14:36.443
or a waiter shaved fresh
Parmesan on your shoulders.

14:36.476 --> 14:37.945
Don't you walk away, Bianca.

14:37.978 --> 14:39.346
You walk like the March

14:39.379 --> 14:40.680
of the dang Penguins.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.282
Every time you go
to the water fountain,

14:42.315 --> 14:44.351
Morgan Freeman starts narrating.
(snaps fingers)

14:44.384 --> 14:46.519
Shut up! Stop being
so mean to us.

14:46.553 --> 14:50.190
Fine. As long as you recognize
that I am the Queen Bee.

14:50.223 --> 14:53.026
From now on, I make the plans,
and you follow them.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.728
First up: You will delete
that picture from your Facebook

14:55.762 --> 14:57.197
and issue an apology.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.531
And, oh, yes, there's more.

14:58.565 --> 14:59.732
I will reveal the rest

14:59.766 --> 15:01.534
of my plan after school
at my house.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.570
If you're not there...

15:03.603 --> 15:05.338
*

15:06.906 --> 15:08.575
Mmm. Thanks for the lunch, guys.

15:08.608 --> 15:10.543
This baby of yours
is always hungry.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.645
Oh, did you try
the Ikea meatballs?

15:12.679 --> 15:14.214
We know they're
your favorite.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.748
Ooh, and the hot dogs
you love from Costco.

15:15.782 --> 15:18.485
Oh, this is all really sweet,
but are you only doing this

15:18.518 --> 15:20.387
'cause Monty asked me
to be his surrogate?

15:20.420 --> 15:22.855
Monty who now
did what now?
Bryan, stop.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.492
Yes, we heard what he did.

15:25.525 --> 15:26.559
Well, I said no.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.728
Oh, thank God.
Because, honestly,

15:28.761 --> 15:31.098
we were kind of hoping

15:31.131 --> 15:33.500
that you would be
the surrogate for our next baby.

15:33.533 --> 15:34.567
We were thinking
a year and a half

15:34.601 --> 15:35.902
down the road
after this one's born.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.304
Because then we'll be
looking at preschools.

15:37.337 --> 15:39.506
Yeah, and then after he's
enrolled, a year after that,

15:39.539 --> 15:40.940
then maybe we could start
talking about our third.

15:40.974 --> 15:42.609
Which will be perfect, 'cause
then we have our 40th birthdays

15:42.642 --> 15:44.277
in Napa, which we should
start planning, by the way.

15:44.311 --> 15:46.246
True.
All the kids will
be out of diapers.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.414
Whoa-whoa, wait-wait-wait, guys.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.249
What about me
in all this?

15:49.282 --> 15:51.084
I'm not just a baby maker.

15:51.118 --> 15:52.585
I have a plan, too.

15:52.619 --> 15:55.022
And it doesn't involve
being pregnant all the time.

15:55.055 --> 15:57.690
I want to start making
my own children's clothes.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.959
I want to set up a booth
at the farmers' market

15:59.993 --> 16:01.761
and... see what happens.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.263
Wait, that's a plan?

16:03.296 --> 16:06.799
That's... fantastic,
Goldie; we had no idea.

16:06.833 --> 16:09.469
Look, I love you guys--
you know that.

16:09.502 --> 16:12.605
I never would have gotten
to this point without you.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.974
And as much as I
would love to be

16:15.008 --> 16:16.376
knocked up with
your next one,

16:16.409 --> 16:18.445
I can't commit right now.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.647
I need to stick to my plan.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.482
Yes, you do.

16:22.515 --> 16:23.883
Are you okay with that?

16:23.916 --> 16:26.986
Yes, Goldie, we only want you
to be successful, and happy.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.788
DAVID:
And now that you're
starting a new business,

16:28.821 --> 16:30.657
then you're gonna need
all of the energy

16:30.690 --> 16:32.292
and focus
that you could get.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.626
So eat up, lady.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.628
You have got
some sewing to do!
Okay.

16:35.662 --> 16:36.796
(laughs)

16:36.829 --> 16:38.065
Mmm...
Mmm...

16:38.098 --> 16:39.732
I love you, guys.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.168
Not as much as this

16:41.201 --> 16:43.936
deep-fried calamari,
but pretty darn close.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.645
First of all, I'm
not gonna thank you
all for coming today,

16:52.679 --> 16:55.582
because a Queen Bee
never thanks her subjects.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.984
That's cool.
We're just happy...
Silence!

16:58.017 --> 16:59.519
(snaps fingers)
Queen Bee speaking.

16:59.552 --> 17:02.155
From this moment on,
the Queen Bee declares

17:02.189 --> 17:05.325
that no one shall ever
be a Queen Bee again.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.326
BIANCA:
What do you mean?

17:06.359 --> 17:07.994
Who's gonna be our,
like, leader?

17:08.027 --> 17:10.430
We all will.

17:10.463 --> 17:11.998
We're gonna stop pointing
out each other's flaws

17:12.031 --> 17:14.267
and start supporting
each other as people,

17:14.301 --> 17:16.169
and especially
as women.

17:16.203 --> 17:18.738
Read these books
by my feminist heroes,

17:18.771 --> 17:20.840
Germaine Greer and Dolly Parton.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.843
They'll teach you how to love
and embrace all womanhood.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.546
And tonight, we shall burn
all our Barbie dolls

17:26.579 --> 17:30.383
in united unrealistic
body expectation solidarity,

17:30.417 --> 17:33.520
then dance, intoxicated
by the plastic fumes.

17:33.553 --> 17:36.556
Shania... you're weird.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.392
And I love it, sister.

17:43.563 --> 17:46.466
We were wrong to accuse Monty
of stealing Goldie.

17:46.499 --> 17:49.035
It'll make us feel better
to apologize.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.637
Fine. But you
have to say

17:50.670 --> 17:52.472
(rings doorbell)
the actual "I'm sorry" part.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.207
I'll just nod earnestly.

17:54.241 --> 17:56.476
You look like
Katherine Hepburn.

17:57.744 --> 17:58.711
Hello, boys.

17:58.745 --> 17:59.779
Gary, why
are you...

17:59.812 --> 18:01.047
Monty, we've
got company!

18:01.080 --> 18:02.982
Phone call would've been nice.
But come on in.

18:03.015 --> 18:04.151
What are you
doing here?

18:04.184 --> 18:05.652
The real question is:
What are you doing here?

18:05.685 --> 18:08.054
Oh, hey, guys.
What a nice surprise.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.257
Thanks for getting the door.
Oh.

18:10.290 --> 18:11.658
Honey, breath.
Oh, sorry.

18:11.691 --> 18:12.925
Remember what
I told you.

18:12.959 --> 18:14.727
Here you go.
"Please" and "thank you."

18:14.761 --> 18:16.729
What in the hell
is happening here?

18:16.763 --> 18:18.565
Oh, you know, life has
a funny way of working out.

18:18.598 --> 18:19.932
A few days ago,
I was doing

18:19.966 --> 18:22.169
Tai Chi on the beach,
and I look over

18:22.202 --> 18:23.903
and there is Gary, filming me.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.172
GARY: I was
stalking you.

18:25.205 --> 18:26.606
No, you weren't.
Yes, I was!

18:26.639 --> 18:28.741
I was dressed up
like a UPS man.
My little stalker!

18:28.775 --> 18:30.009
Had a little
camera in my box.

18:30.042 --> 18:32.111
Anyway, we ended up
spending the day together,

18:32.145 --> 18:34.747
and it turns out Gary is
a whiz at organization.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.349
He completely
de-cluttered my life.

18:36.383 --> 18:37.750
He even cleaned up
my DVR queue.

18:37.784 --> 18:38.918
I mean, who am I kidding?

18:38.951 --> 18:40.019
I'm never gonna watch
Breaking Amish.

18:40.052 --> 18:41.020
What can I say?

18:41.053 --> 18:42.455
I'm a bossy,
bossy bottom.

18:42.489 --> 18:43.690
And that's what I needed.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.024
Someone to tame
this wild stallion.

18:45.057 --> 18:46.259
That's right.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.528
So far, we have
a surprising amount in common.

18:48.561 --> 18:50.029
We both love
to whistle.

18:50.062 --> 18:52.265
And we both really want
a family. Speaking of...

18:52.299 --> 18:55.602
Oh, here she is!
The prettiest lady
in the world!

18:55.635 --> 18:57.370
There you are.
Guys, this is Nicole.

18:57.404 --> 18:58.938
Hey, honey, go get
your tennis racket.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.940
Your lesson starts in
half an hour, pretty lady.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.942
You already have a kid?
No, it's Gary's niece.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.444
Gar is so good
with kids.

19:04.477 --> 19:05.478
Why didn't you guys tell me?

19:05.512 --> 19:06.646
We wanted to make
sure that we

19:06.679 --> 19:07.647
were ready
for parenthood

19:07.680 --> 19:08.948
before we took
the old plungeroo,

19:08.981 --> 19:10.950
so we're practicing
with my sister's oldest.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.885
And she is thrilled
with the attention.

19:12.919 --> 19:14.020
She eats paste
and boogers

19:14.053 --> 19:15.622
and doesn't have
a lick of friends,

19:15.655 --> 19:18.057
and next year she gets her
third whack at fourth grade,

19:18.090 --> 19:19.392
but you know what,
we love her to death.

19:19.426 --> 19:20.627
But we need to thank you guys,

19:20.660 --> 19:22.795
not just for introducing us,
but for showing us

19:22.829 --> 19:24.497
what a loving family looks like.

19:24.531 --> 19:25.965
It's what we
aspire to.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.900
And we got to get
going, pumpkin.
Okay.

19:27.934 --> 19:30.136
I've got all of your things
right inside of the bag.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.339
And don't forget
your sunblock this time.

19:32.372 --> 19:34.841
Oh, my prince on the streets
and freak in the sheets.

19:34.874 --> 19:36.108
(chuckles)
Love him.

19:37.210 --> 19:39.279
Thank you very much.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.583
These buttons are so cute.

19:43.616 --> 19:45.485
I can't believe
you made all these.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.320
Do you like them?
I love them.

19:47.354 --> 19:48.988
I'm a little
ambivalent

19:49.021 --> 19:50.823
about other kids having
access to my wicked style.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.425
But I'll be okay,

19:52.459 --> 19:55.728
at least until these
babies catch on.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.497
I'm really proud of you, Mom.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.165
Thanks, monkey.
You know,

19:59.198 --> 20:00.533
for the first time ever,

20:00.567 --> 20:02.168
it feels like I'm
finally doing something

20:02.201 --> 20:03.536
that I love-- you know,

20:03.570 --> 20:05.272
something... for me.

20:05.305 --> 20:07.774
For us.
Awesome Girl Apparel?

20:07.807 --> 20:10.277
Uh-huh. Just something I was
thinking about calling my stuff.

20:10.310 --> 20:11.444
I wanted a name

20:11.478 --> 20:12.779
that honored my inspiration.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.714
You. You're my
awesome girl.

20:14.747 --> 20:15.782
(patting bed)

20:15.815 --> 20:17.617
I saw you with
those mean girls,

20:17.650 --> 20:20.052
how you showed them it's okay
to embrace who they are

20:20.086 --> 20:21.521
and respect
everyone's differences.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.856
If I had a Shania at my
school when I was your age,

20:23.890 --> 20:25.458
maybe I wouldn't
have been so hung up

20:25.492 --> 20:26.893
on my acne
or my wonky eye.

20:26.926 --> 20:29.228
Where is she looking?
Over there or over there?

20:29.262 --> 20:32.031
Come on, Mom, if you'd had a
good self-image in high school,

20:32.064 --> 20:34.534
you wouldn't have gotten
pregnant when you were 15.

20:34.567 --> 20:38.405
But then, you wouldn't be here
to make that point, so...

20:39.339 --> 20:41.708
(laughing)

20:41.741 --> 20:44.744
GOLDIE:
You got it? Whoa, oh, my gosh.

20:44.777 --> 20:48.047
BRYAN:
Someone once said-- and I'm
going to say that it was me--

20:48.080 --> 20:50.917
"If you want God to laugh,
make a plan."

20:50.950 --> 20:53.720
Well, Goldie had a plan
to be a lawyer,

20:53.753 --> 20:55.555
but it kind of
didn't go like that.

20:55.588 --> 20:56.889
Shania!

20:56.923 --> 20:59.058
Shania had a plan
to be well-liked

20:59.091 --> 21:01.060
by her peers,
and she got that--

21:01.093 --> 21:03.095
but not the way she planned.

21:03.129 --> 21:05.097
(indistinct shouts)

21:05.131 --> 21:07.300
And David and I,
well, we always planned

21:07.334 --> 21:10.002
on having a big family.
Looking good!

21:10.036 --> 21:12.905
We just never planned on it
looking anything like this one.

21:12.939 --> 21:16.409
But like they always say,
"Life is what happens to you

21:16.443 --> 21:17.910
when you're busy
making other plans."

21:17.944 --> 21:20.079
Eh-eh-eh-eh.
Goldie's money.
