00:04.265 --> 00:06.006
<i>Previously on</i> Bull...

00:06.049 --> 00:07.790
- Where's Astrid?
- He took her. He had a gun.

00:07.833 --> 00:09.966
<i>They threatened our daughter.</i>

00:10.010 --> 00:12.142
<i>They nearly took everything</i> <i>
from us, didn't they?</i>

00:12.186 --> 00:13.622
Ed Wilson,
you're under arrest.

00:13.665 --> 00:14.971
What's the charge?

00:15.015 --> 00:16.233
Negligent homicide. Six counts.

00:16.277 --> 00:18.409
Excuse me. Kristi?

00:18.453 --> 00:21.412
The maintenance guy told you not
to get on Ed's bad side. Why?

00:21.456 --> 00:23.545
He said he knew things about Ed.
Scary things.

00:23.588 --> 00:25.547
- And now he's dead.
- So Ed leaked poison

00:25.590 --> 00:27.984
in his own building
just to silence Nicholas?

00:28.028 --> 00:29.203
One night, I followed Jodie.

00:29.246 --> 00:30.900
I put her body
in a barrel

00:30.943 --> 00:32.641
and buried her
in Saunders Woods.

00:32.684 --> 00:34.904
Why are you telling me this now?

00:34.947 --> 00:35.948
Since I'm telling you myself...

00:35.992 --> 00:37.341
It's privileged.

00:45.480 --> 00:49.397
♪ We're dancing like we're
dumb-dumb-du-du-du-dumb ♪

00:49.440 --> 00:51.747
♪ Our bodies going
numb-numb-nu-nu-nu-numb... ♪

00:51.790 --> 00:53.314
I can't believe you're not
going to the party tonight.

00:53.357 --> 00:54.880
Okay, yeah, well,
my parents will kill me

00:54.924 --> 00:56.708
if I don't go home
and check out that brownstone.

00:56.752 --> 00:59.450
We've got one month before we
graduate and real life starts.

00:59.494 --> 01:00.799
You can see your boring
parents whenever.

01:00.843 --> 01:03.063
You are a drama queen.

01:03.106 --> 01:04.194
- So?
- Okay? We're gonna have plenty of time

01:04.238 --> 01:05.674
to hang out before graduation.

01:05.717 --> 01:07.415
- Okay.
- Oh, no.

01:07.458 --> 01:08.894
What?

01:08.938 --> 01:10.853
I think I have a flat tire.

01:10.896 --> 01:12.898
That sucks.

01:12.942 --> 01:14.248
H-Helpful, thank you.

01:14.291 --> 01:15.075
Yeah, well,
I got to check this out.

01:15.118 --> 01:16.250
Okay, I'll call you back?

01:16.293 --> 01:18.078
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:18.121 --> 01:19.514
- Be careful.
- Okay, bye.

01:19.557 --> 01:21.472
Bye.

01:31.439 --> 01:32.440
Crap.

01:46.193 --> 01:47.368
Flat tire?

01:47.411 --> 01:48.630
Uh...

01:48.673 --> 01:50.066
Yeah.

01:53.461 --> 01:54.897
Need a hand?

01:57.117 --> 01:59.902
Uh, y-yeah,
if you wouldn't mind,

01:59.945 --> 02:01.904
that'd be really great, thanks.

02:01.947 --> 02:04.124
Okay.

02:05.603 --> 02:07.170
She's flat, all right.

02:07.214 --> 02:09.085
Yeah.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.478
See? You drove over a nail.

02:10.521 --> 02:12.175
Oh.

02:12.219 --> 02:13.524
All right.

02:13.568 --> 02:15.657
Sit tight,
I'll go grab my tools.

02:15.700 --> 02:18.094
Thanks.

02:31.716 --> 02:35.111
Okay, let's get you
taken care of.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.505
Aw, thank you so...

03:11.278 --> 03:13.236
Help me, please.

03:42.613 --> 03:44.441
What the hell, man?

03:44.485 --> 03:46.182
- It's the middle of the night.
- Then go back to bed!

03:46.226 --> 03:47.749
Bull?

03:48.750 --> 03:50.534
What's going on?

03:50.578 --> 03:51.622
I need your help.

03:54.408 --> 03:55.583
The spot should be coming up.

03:55.626 --> 03:57.411
Hey, slow down, will you?

03:57.454 --> 03:59.282
I got to return this thing
to my old partner in one piece.

03:59.326 --> 04:00.979
Well, I'd like to get this over
with as quickly as possible.

04:01.023 --> 04:02.372
What is the point of this?

04:02.416 --> 04:04.244
"What's the point?"

04:04.287 --> 04:06.463
Not that I don't love a
good walk in the woods,

04:06.507 --> 04:07.856
but what if we do find
that girl's body?

04:07.899 --> 04:09.249
Isn't what Ed told
you privileged?

04:09.292 --> 04:10.380
I have to know
if he's telling the truth.

04:10.424 --> 04:13.035
Why would he lie
about killing someone?

04:13.078 --> 04:16.473
A pathological need
for attention, delusional.

04:16.517 --> 04:18.562
It could be a lot of things.

04:18.606 --> 04:22.087
You really think
that's the case here?

04:22.131 --> 04:23.785
A man can hope.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.791
All right, I think
this is the place,

04:29.834 --> 04:34.143
because he said above the creek,
near some columns.

04:34.186 --> 04:37.581
All right. Let me
get this thing going.

04:42.543 --> 04:43.848
You sure you know how to use it?

04:43.892 --> 04:45.850
Would you like
to call in an expert?

04:45.894 --> 04:48.331
No.
All right.

04:48.375 --> 04:50.812
All I know is, it's
a ground-penetrating radar.

04:53.467 --> 04:56.078
If there's something buried
here, this thing will find it.

04:56.121 --> 04:58.385
- All right.
- Here we go.

05:23.192 --> 05:24.541
H-Hey, Bull? Come here.

05:24.585 --> 05:26.282
There's a void.

05:27.588 --> 05:29.329
There's something buried here.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.462
It could be a barrel.

05:32.506 --> 05:34.290
Big enough to hold a body?

05:35.422 --> 05:36.640
Yeah.

05:40.905 --> 05:43.952
I love you, Daddy.

05:43.995 --> 05:45.867
I love you, too, honey.

05:54.223 --> 05:55.659
Did you just get in?

05:55.703 --> 05:58.706
Yeah. Something came up at work.

05:58.749 --> 06:00.795
Is everything all right?

06:06.366 --> 06:09.151
If we hadn't gotten Astrid back,

06:09.194 --> 06:12.937
would you have ever been
able to find peace?

06:12.981 --> 06:14.939
Jason, what's wrong?

06:14.983 --> 06:16.550
Is this about
what happened...

06:16.593 --> 06:17.725
Will you just answer
the question, please?

06:17.768 --> 06:19.509
Well, you know my answer.
If I didn't know

06:19.553 --> 06:21.032
what happened to my baby,
I would never be at peace.

06:21.076 --> 06:22.730
I would search for her
until the day I died.

06:24.471 --> 06:26.386
And then I would hunt down the
monster that took her from us.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.564
Thank you.

06:34.219 --> 06:35.395
Where are you going?

06:37.135 --> 06:39.573
To hunt down a monster.

06:56.285 --> 06:58.461
So, what's so important you
couldn't tell me on the phone?

06:58.505 --> 07:01.159
I ever told you what
a good attorney you are?

07:01.203 --> 07:03.466
Uh, thanks?

07:03.510 --> 07:05.250
You did such a fantastic
job on Ed's case

07:05.294 --> 07:07.252
that I'd bet my last dollar,

07:07.296 --> 07:09.254
when the jury starts
deliberating this morning,

07:09.298 --> 07:11.561
they're going to acquit.

07:11.605 --> 07:13.650
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

07:15.217 --> 07:17.045
Last night, Ed confessed
to me that he killed

07:17.088 --> 07:18.786
all those people
in his building.

07:18.829 --> 07:21.092
On purpose.
And he did it to cover up

07:21.136 --> 07:23.181
the murder
of a 21-year-old girl

07:23.225 --> 07:24.879
whose parents
are still looking for her.

07:25.967 --> 07:27.490
What?

07:27.534 --> 07:29.492
He told me
where he buried her body.

07:29.536 --> 07:32.626
I checked,
and she's still there.

07:33.888 --> 07:34.889
How long?

07:35.890 --> 07:37.457
Ten years.

07:39.807 --> 07:41.635
And her parents think
that she just...

07:41.678 --> 07:43.071
They don't know what to think.

07:43.114 --> 07:45.552
She was driving home
from college.

07:45.595 --> 07:47.075
They found her car
on the side of the road,

07:47.118 --> 07:48.468
and it's like
she just...

07:49.512 --> 07:51.514
...disappeared.

07:51.558 --> 07:55.257
If that happened to Anna,
I would lose my mind.

07:55.300 --> 07:56.737
We helped him, Chunk.

07:56.780 --> 07:58.478
And he's gonna get away
with all of it

07:58.521 --> 08:02.699
because I believed him and
because you did such a good job.

08:12.056 --> 08:13.797
Bull,

08:13.841 --> 08:15.016
this is horrible...

08:17.192 --> 08:19.281
...but it's privileged.

08:19.324 --> 08:23.198
If we go to the police and they
find anything as a result of it,

08:23.241 --> 08:24.808
it's tainted.

08:24.852 --> 08:27.245
And the prosecution
can't use it in court.

08:27.289 --> 08:28.812
There's nothing
that we can do.

08:32.599 --> 08:34.644
Are you absolutely sure?

08:36.603 --> 08:38.256
<i>Did Ed say anything</i>

08:38.300 --> 08:39.431
to make you think
he might hurt someone else?

08:39.475 --> 08:41.042
No, he didn't
threaten anyone.

08:41.085 --> 08:42.260
But he kills people
to solve his problems,

08:42.304 --> 08:44.567
so he will kill again.

08:44.611 --> 08:45.960
It doesn't matter what
you think he might do.

08:46.003 --> 08:48.136
In order for the crime-fraud
exception to apply,

08:48.179 --> 08:51.792
he has to have specifically
threatened to hurt somebody.

08:51.835 --> 08:53.750
Did he commit perjury?
You'd have to tell the judge.

08:53.794 --> 08:55.926
No. I checked the trial
transcript already.

08:55.970 --> 08:57.624
No, there's got to be
something that we can do.

08:57.667 --> 08:59.495
Because if this jury acquits,

08:59.539 --> 09:00.931
then double jeopardy attaches,

09:00.975 --> 09:04.326
and no matter
what anybody finds out ever,

09:04.369 --> 09:05.893
- Ed can't be retried.
- I don't get

09:05.936 --> 09:08.373
why you can just tell
your attorney something terrible

09:08.417 --> 09:09.549
and they have
to keep it a secret.

09:09.592 --> 09:12.160
There's a body
in the woods, Chunk.

09:12.203 --> 09:13.988
This guy is evil.

09:14.031 --> 09:16.033
We don't get to choose
what secrets we keep.

09:16.077 --> 09:17.905
Our clients have to be able
to talk to us about anything,

09:17.948 --> 09:20.168
even if it is illegal.

09:20.211 --> 09:22.126
That's how we get them
to trust us.

09:22.170 --> 09:23.650
Without privilege,

09:23.693 --> 09:25.739
we can't defend them.

09:25.782 --> 09:27.871
I mean, hell, uh, without that,
the whole system falls down.

09:27.915 --> 09:29.351
What if we got a mistrial?

09:29.394 --> 09:31.440
If we get

09:31.483 --> 09:34.182
a mistrial,
double jeopardy wouldn't attach.

09:34.225 --> 09:35.618
Rob would have to refile
charges against Ed.

09:35.662 --> 09:37.533
Uh, it would at least

09:37.577 --> 09:38.969
buy us some time till
we figure something else out.

09:39.013 --> 09:40.580
Huh.

09:44.366 --> 09:48.152
Bull, I don't have
a basis to file

09:48.196 --> 09:49.371
a motion
for a mistrial.

09:49.414 --> 09:51.112
What if you did?

09:51.155 --> 09:53.331
If you knew a juror
was breaking the rules,

09:53.375 --> 09:55.203
you'd be duty-bound
to come forward.

09:55.246 --> 09:56.944
I don't know that anyone
has broken the rules.

09:56.987 --> 09:59.207
Not yet.

10:01.688 --> 10:03.124
<i>You want to poll the jury?</i>

10:03.167 --> 10:04.821
<i>Yes, Your Honor.</i>

10:04.865 --> 10:06.475
On what grounds?
To see if any of the jurors

10:06.518 --> 10:08.651
have been reading or watching
any of the prolific,

10:08.695 --> 10:11.828
sensational coverage
of this trial.

10:11.872 --> 10:13.264
Do you have cause to believe
that some of the jurors

10:13.308 --> 10:14.657
- have broken my order?
- This is nothing

10:14.701 --> 10:16.267
but a fishing expedition,
Your Honor.

10:16.311 --> 10:17.529
Dr. Bull must have run a
mock jury deliberation

10:17.573 --> 10:19.967
and his client was convicted.

10:20.010 --> 10:22.447
Now they're hoping
for a do-over.

10:22.491 --> 10:24.232
A.D.A. Jones has been whipping
up the press since day one.

10:24.275 --> 10:25.973
He's been doing everything
in his power to make sure

10:26.016 --> 10:28.497
that this story is impossible
for the jury to avoid.

10:28.540 --> 10:30.020
Six people died.
Of course it's a big story.

10:30.064 --> 10:32.240
But that doesn't mean
that our carefully selected jury

10:32.283 --> 10:35.025
violated Your Honor's
very clear instructions.

10:35.069 --> 10:36.679
As everyone knows, some
people follow instructions,

10:36.723 --> 10:38.681
some people don't.
What we need to do is verify...

10:38.725 --> 10:40.074
Oh, so this is just a hunch?
You don't even have

10:40.117 --> 10:41.162
any actual evidence... That's enough, Mr. Jones.

10:42.337 --> 10:43.599
The defense is right.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.166
This case has been
a media circus

10:45.209 --> 10:46.646
from the start.

10:46.689 --> 10:48.212
Get your client to court.

10:49.474 --> 10:51.868
As soon as the jurors
are seated,

10:51.912 --> 10:52.956
I'll poll them.
Thank you very much.

10:53.000 --> 10:53.653
Thank you.
Thank you.

11:01.748 --> 11:03.488
What's going on?

11:03.532 --> 11:05.882
I'm washing my hands.

11:05.926 --> 11:08.668
Something weird is going on.

11:08.711 --> 11:10.408
- Chester?
- Do you mind?

11:10.452 --> 11:12.672
Why did you let Bull
fight your fight in there?

11:20.462 --> 11:21.898
Bull isn't fighting my fight.

11:23.770 --> 11:25.510
I don't think
you want a mistrial.

11:25.554 --> 11:27.077
If you think that I'm losing,

11:27.121 --> 11:29.079
then why wouldn't I want
a mistrial?

11:29.123 --> 11:30.907
Because you know your client
was negligent and you think Bull

11:30.951 --> 11:32.779
is trying to manipulate the
system to get him an acquittal.

11:32.822 --> 11:34.824
You wouldn't be
okay with that.

11:34.868 --> 11:36.696
I know you.

11:36.739 --> 11:37.827
You don't know me
or Bull that well

11:37.871 --> 11:39.307
if you think that's
what's going on here.

11:39.350 --> 11:40.917
Then tell me,
what is going on here?

11:40.961 --> 11:42.353
Enlighten me.

11:53.147 --> 11:54.844
I know what you're
trying to do.

11:54.888 --> 11:56.977
I'm just trying to get
my client a fair trial.

11:57.020 --> 12:00.241
No, you're trying
to make sure I don't win.

12:00.284 --> 12:02.286
You can't do this.

12:02.330 --> 12:04.245
It is a
blatant breach

12:04.288 --> 12:05.942
of your duty to me.

12:08.162 --> 12:10.033
Then why don't you go
tell the judge

12:10.077 --> 12:12.079
why I'd want to betray

12:12.122 --> 12:13.907
my duty to you.

12:15.865 --> 12:18.563
Tell her about Jodie Comroe.

12:18.607 --> 12:20.478
I dare you.

12:20.522 --> 12:22.306
Court is in session!

12:28.530 --> 12:29.836
<i>Before you begin deliberations,</i>

12:29.879 --> 12:32.316
I'm going to take a poll.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.797
I'm going to ask
each and every one of you

12:34.841 --> 12:36.799
if you have
read or watched

12:36.843 --> 12:39.410
any of the media stories
about this trial.

12:39.454 --> 12:41.543
Remember, you
took an oath

12:41.586 --> 12:43.719
to render a verdict based solely

12:43.763 --> 12:46.026
on evidence presented
to you in this courtroom.

12:46.069 --> 12:48.158
- You want a preview?
- Mm-hmm.

12:48.202 --> 12:49.333
I've been doing
a little snooping.

12:49.377 --> 12:50.639
At least four of our jurors

12:50.682 --> 12:52.336
couldn't resist
following the story.

12:52.380 --> 12:55.383
I would bet on jurors
three, eight and 11

12:55.426 --> 12:57.211
to come clean.

12:57.254 --> 12:58.908
That's enough to cause
a mistrial, isn't it?

12:58.952 --> 13:00.214
Yep.

13:01.563 --> 13:03.304
Excuse me, Your Honor.

13:03.347 --> 13:05.175
I know it's unorthodox
for me to speak

13:05.219 --> 13:07.438
on my own behalf,

13:07.482 --> 13:09.614
but I want to waive
my right to poll the jury.

13:09.658 --> 13:11.703
I trust
these fine jurors

13:11.747 --> 13:13.749
to be fair
and impartial

13:13.793 --> 13:15.142
no matter what they've read.

13:15.185 --> 13:17.100
Mr. Wilson, you do
understand that by waiving

13:17.144 --> 13:18.536
this right, you may be
undermining your right

13:18.580 --> 13:20.103
to a fair trial?

13:20.147 --> 13:21.931
I understand, Your Honor.

13:21.975 --> 13:23.846
I just want
to get this over with.

13:25.369 --> 13:27.328
Okay.

13:27.371 --> 13:30.635
Then, jurors, please make your
way back to the jury room.

13:30.679 --> 13:32.333
You may begin deliberations.

13:42.865 --> 13:44.693
Wow.

13:44.736 --> 13:48.131
I think I really connected
with the jury.

13:48.175 --> 13:51.047
I guess I have you
to thank for that opportunity.

13:59.751 --> 14:01.188
Ed got to them.

14:01.231 --> 14:02.842
I could see it on their faces.

14:02.885 --> 14:04.844
He got to the jury.
They're gonna acquit now.

14:04.887 --> 14:06.280
We don't know that
for sure, Bull.

14:06.323 --> 14:08.673
Yes, I do. He's been one
step ahead the whole time.

14:08.717 --> 14:10.023
And he's gonna get
away with everything

14:10.066 --> 14:11.851
if I we don't find
a way to expose him.

14:13.461 --> 14:15.028
You said I was
a good attorney, right?

14:15.071 --> 14:17.247
Yeah.

14:17.291 --> 14:19.510
And a good attorney would
stay far, far away from anything

14:19.554 --> 14:21.251
Okay, Chunk, I understand.that would violate
attorney-client privilege.

14:21.295 --> 14:22.600
You've made it clear you don't
want to be a part of this.

14:22.644 --> 14:24.907
There is someone
- that can bring Ed down.
- Who?

14:24.951 --> 14:27.214
Someone who's not bound
by privilege.

14:27.257 --> 14:29.085
The woman that Danny talked to.
Kristi Walker.

14:30.652 --> 14:32.306
And if she told the police
what she knows,

14:32.349 --> 14:34.264
the evidence
wouldn't be tainted,

14:34.308 --> 14:35.483
and they could act on it.

14:35.526 --> 14:37.528
Rob would jump
all over it.

14:37.572 --> 14:39.400
If there's new evidence, he
could stop jury deliberations.

14:39.443 --> 14:41.010
Buy some time.

14:41.054 --> 14:42.664
And you know Rob
would not let it go

14:42.707 --> 14:43.752
until he got
to the bottom of it.

14:43.795 --> 14:45.275
Okay, so we have to get Kristi

14:45.319 --> 14:46.494
to come forward
- with what she knows.
- No, no.

14:46.537 --> 14:48.061
<i>We</i> can't do anything, Bull.

14:48.104 --> 14:50.411
Advising Kristi to testify
against my client

14:50.454 --> 14:52.892
is the ultimate breach
of my duty of loyalty.

14:52.935 --> 14:54.502
No one would have to know
you were behind it.

14:54.545 --> 14:56.112
I would know.

15:00.725 --> 15:03.641
It's a beautiful day
for a long walk.

15:03.685 --> 15:04.991
I think I'm gonna
take one.

15:05.034 --> 15:06.514
Give people who aren't

15:06.557 --> 15:07.515
good attorneys

15:07.558 --> 15:08.908
enough time to go do

15:08.951 --> 15:10.648
what it is that they need to do.

15:13.782 --> 15:15.262
Thank you.

15:15.305 --> 15:16.741
Don't thank me.
I didn't do anything.

15:20.180 --> 15:22.356
Hey. We need to track
down Kristi Walker

15:22.399 --> 15:24.575
before that jury
renders a verdict.

15:24.619 --> 15:26.795
Okay. You should know,
our mirror jury looks like

15:26.838 --> 15:28.536
they'll finished
deliberating by day's end.

15:28.579 --> 15:31.147
Well, then, let's find her fast.

15:31.191 --> 15:33.976
Taylor, can you ping
Kristi Walker's cell phone?

15:34.020 --> 15:35.673
And triangulate her location
or whatever it is

15:35.717 --> 15:37.327
- you magically do?
- I haven't had to do

15:37.371 --> 15:39.808
the cell tower
triangulation thing in years.

15:39.851 --> 15:43.986
Nowadays it's as easy as hacking
into the E-911 system and...

15:44.030 --> 15:46.075
Oh, you mean
just shut up and do it.

15:46.119 --> 15:48.556
Why are we looking
- for Kristi again?
Because I'm gonna

15:48.599 --> 15:50.732
convince her to tell the police
everything she knows.

15:50.775 --> 15:52.125
Guys, sorry, but Kristi's phone

15:52.168 --> 15:53.996
has been powered down
since yesterday.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.129
She probably ditched it
after Danny came after her.

15:56.172 --> 15:57.826
Damn it.

15:57.869 --> 15:59.436
Do you still have access
to Ed's apartment building?

15:59.480 --> 16:01.003
Yeah.

16:01.047 --> 16:03.353
I can go over
to Kristi's apartment,

16:03.397 --> 16:04.789
see if there's any hint
to where she might've gone.

16:04.833 --> 16:06.661
I like it. Let's go.

16:06.704 --> 16:09.707
Guess he's going with.

16:09.751 --> 16:11.187
<i>I get that we can't</i> <i>
tell the police</i>

16:11.231 --> 16:13.015
what Ed told Bull,
but what if someone

16:13.059 --> 16:16.192
just so happened
to trip over the body?

16:16.236 --> 16:19.717
Who's gonna trip over a body
buried in a barrel underground?

16:19.761 --> 16:20.980
Treasure hunters.

16:22.024 --> 16:23.156
Treasure hunters?

16:23.199 --> 16:24.766
The Internet
is full of groups

16:24.809 --> 16:26.289
who hunt for all types
of lost artifacts.

16:26.333 --> 16:28.161
There just so happens
to be a very active group

16:28.204 --> 16:31.599
focused on Revolutionary War
artifacts in the Northeast.

16:31.642 --> 16:35.124
And you just so happen
to know this.

16:35.168 --> 16:37.648
I might have done
some poking around.

16:37.692 --> 16:41.348
And these folks are gonna trip
over Jodie's body because...?

16:41.391 --> 16:44.133
I'm gonna infiltrate
the group and plant a...

16:46.614 --> 16:48.050
Hi.

16:48.094 --> 16:50.009
Hey.
Hey.

16:57.581 --> 17:01.020
And plant a clue to the location
of a valuable artifact,

17:01.063 --> 17:03.065
which is actually the location
of Jodie's body.

17:03.109 --> 17:06.025
What if the police wonder
where this clue came from?

17:08.505 --> 17:12.335
I promise you, no one will ever
trace this back to us.

17:12.379 --> 17:13.815
Are you really okay
leaving that girl

17:13.858 --> 17:15.773
buried in the woods forever?

17:20.996 --> 17:22.171
Plant the clue.

17:28.438 --> 17:30.092
I'll send these to Taylor,

17:30.136 --> 17:32.094
have her run a facial rec
on Kristi's friend.

17:32.138 --> 17:33.052
She could be crashing with her.

17:33.095 --> 17:34.662
Good.

17:34.705 --> 17:36.664
Man, Kristi was so lucky
she was working the night

17:36.707 --> 17:38.187
of the carbon monoxide leak.

17:38.231 --> 17:39.406
Two of the victims lived
on either side of her.

17:39.449 --> 17:41.799
- She could've died, too.
- Yep, and if she did,

17:41.843 --> 17:44.193
we wouldn't have known
about any of this.

17:44.237 --> 17:46.282
Ignorance is bliss, huh?

17:46.326 --> 17:47.588
Yeah.

17:51.983 --> 17:55.813
Kristi saw Ed
for who he was and I did not.

17:55.857 --> 17:58.033
Nicholas told her who Ed was.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.469
Yep, and she believed him.

17:59.513 --> 18:01.341
You told me
and I didn't want to believe.

18:01.384 --> 18:04.039
Now, Ed is about to get away
with multiple murders

18:04.083 --> 18:07.129
because I let him manipulate me.

18:09.131 --> 18:10.393
Huh.

18:10.437 --> 18:11.742
What'd you find?

18:12.830 --> 18:15.746
A sobriety chip.

18:15.790 --> 18:17.400
Kristi's in recovery.

18:17.444 --> 18:20.099
She was off the wagon
when I saw her last time.

18:20.142 --> 18:24.668
Yeah, but blue means
six months sober.

18:24.712 --> 18:27.932
Her sobriety
must be important to her.

18:27.976 --> 18:29.108
You think she'd go to a meeting?

18:29.151 --> 18:30.848
Her life is falling apart.

18:30.892 --> 18:34.461
She needs a space
to feel safe and supported.

18:34.504 --> 18:36.854
<i>I think she'd go to her</i> <i>
regular meeting place.</i>

18:46.908 --> 18:48.910
Hey, Kristi.
I'm Jason.

18:48.953 --> 18:51.739
Uh, I need your help.

18:51.782 --> 18:53.175
Are you looking for a meeting?

18:53.219 --> 18:54.959
This one just ended,
but they have one...

18:55.003 --> 18:57.440
No, no, it's not
about a meeting....like, every three hours.

18:57.484 --> 19:00.139
Um...

19:00.182 --> 19:02.837
I want you
to know that...

19:02.880 --> 19:05.492
I believe you.

19:05.535 --> 19:08.103
About Ed.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.105
I know what
happened, and... You know what, I got a job

19:10.149 --> 19:11.150
and I really can't
- be late for it.
- And I know that-- I believe

19:11.193 --> 19:13.152
that Ed killed Nicholas,
he murdered

19:13.195 --> 19:14.718
all those people
in your building,

19:14.762 --> 19:16.155
and you're the only person
who can prove it.

19:18.418 --> 19:20.115
I need your help.

19:21.899 --> 19:23.118
And here you go.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.511
- Thank you.
- Sure.

19:26.382 --> 19:28.819
How's it going?

19:28.863 --> 19:30.386
It took some nudging,

19:30.430 --> 19:31.561
but the hunt is finally
catching fire.

19:31.605 --> 19:32.780
A few people are focusing

19:32.823 --> 19:34.695
- on Saunders Woods.
- Great.

19:34.738 --> 19:36.610
What do they think
they're hunting for?

19:36.653 --> 19:39.134
A cache of weapons
from the Revolutionary War.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.397
Which might have been handled
by George Washington himself.

19:41.441 --> 19:43.791
Ooh, no wonder
it's catching fire.

19:43.834 --> 19:45.662
Did Bull and Danny find Kristi?

19:45.706 --> 19:48.361
It's our new client. General
counsel for Wellman Hospitality

19:48.404 --> 19:51.190
confirming breakfast tomorrow
so he can meet Bull.

19:51.233 --> 19:53.017
Oh, hey.
You should join us.

19:53.061 --> 19:55.411
Tell him about the new cyber
division you'll be heading up.

19:57.979 --> 19:59.285
I can't.

19:59.328 --> 20:01.025
What-- Don't worry,
it's not until 9:30.

20:01.069 --> 20:02.288
You'll have plenty of time
to drop your son

20:02.331 --> 20:03.506
at school beforehand.

20:03.550 --> 20:04.899
It's not Mauricio.

20:04.942 --> 20:08.250
I mean, it is Mauricio.

20:08.294 --> 20:10.600
Is everything all right?

20:13.386 --> 20:15.257
I didn't want to tell you this,
not with everything

20:15.301 --> 20:17.172
that's going on
right now, but...

20:19.000 --> 20:20.654
...I can't lie to you.

20:23.352 --> 20:25.746
I'm moving to Hawai'i.

20:27.661 --> 20:28.879
What?

20:29.837 --> 20:31.447
Why?

20:31.491 --> 20:33.275
We just found out
Mauricio has ADHD...

20:33.319 --> 20:36.278
[sighs]...which is why
he's been acting out.

20:36.322 --> 20:38.541
- I am so sorry.
- The doctor said

20:38.585 --> 20:40.239
he needs a lot more time
and attention.

20:40.282 --> 20:42.284
More than I can
give him here, alone, so...

20:42.328 --> 20:44.895
Listen, we will cut your hours.
We'll get you more help.

20:44.939 --> 20:46.854
You do not need
to move to Hawai'i.

20:46.897 --> 20:49.639
Mauricio needs both
of his parents right now.

20:49.683 --> 20:52.076
And in Hawaii, he'll have
his grandparents, too.

20:52.120 --> 20:53.426
And not to mention all the space

20:53.469 --> 20:55.079
to run around,
get out his excess energy.

20:55.123 --> 20:57.821
Yeah, but you love New York.
This is your home.

20:57.865 --> 20:59.475
Aren't you gonna miss it?

21:02.348 --> 21:04.263
I'm gonna miss you.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.443
I have to do this, Marissa.

21:11.705 --> 21:13.141
I understand.

21:15.361 --> 21:17.885
Why do you have to be
such a good mom?

21:22.672 --> 21:24.718
KRISTI:Nicholas threatened to talk
and look what happened to him.

21:24.761 --> 21:27.111
You can go to the police.
They'll keep you safe.

21:27.155 --> 21:28.069
There's witness protection.

21:28.112 --> 21:29.592
You don't know that.

21:29.636 --> 21:31.855
Yes, I do.

21:31.899 --> 21:34.423
Look, you don't want
to live like this,

21:34.467 --> 21:36.338
always looking
over your shoulder.

21:36.382 --> 21:39.036
I've got a friend in Texas.
I'm gonna stay with her.

21:39.080 --> 21:40.690
I just got to get enough money
for the trip

21:40.734 --> 21:43.867
- and I will be safe there.
- Ed's a dangerous man.

21:43.911 --> 21:45.956
He should be locked up.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.655
Think about the
next person that... Okay, I can't do it.

21:48.698 --> 21:50.178
I already fell off
the wagon once.

21:50.221 --> 21:52.572
I am, I am barely hanging on.

21:52.615 --> 21:54.313
If I have to go
to the police and testify

21:54.356 --> 21:56.140
in court or whatever,
with-with Ed there,

21:56.184 --> 21:58.012
I just, I-I physically cannot.

21:58.055 --> 21:59.753
I cannot.

21:59.796 --> 22:01.363
I know that's what you think,
but you're looking

22:01.407 --> 22:02.669
for the courage to change
what you can, right?

22:02.712 --> 22:05.193
And this is something
you can change.

22:05.236 --> 22:06.020
And I know you're
strong enough to do it.

22:06.063 --> 22:08.414
You don't even know me.

22:08.457 --> 22:10.329
And if you're so sure
that Ed is a killer,

22:10.372 --> 22:11.982
why don't <i>you</i> go to the police?

22:14.202 --> 22:16.770
I can't. There are
rules I have to follow.

22:16.813 --> 22:19.207
A rule. Oh, you don't want
to break some rule,

22:19.250 --> 22:21.557
but you want me to risk my life?

22:21.601 --> 22:22.645
Go to hell.

22:24.821 --> 22:26.345
Kristi.

22:29.173 --> 22:31.393
Be safe.

22:38.574 --> 22:39.967
Hey.

22:40.010 --> 22:41.403
Did you find Kristi?

22:41.447 --> 22:43.318
She's not gonna come forward.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.712
I'm sorry.

22:45.755 --> 22:47.627
How's it going
with the mirror jury?

22:47.670 --> 22:51.457
Uh, 11 not guilties, one man
is holding out to convict.

22:51.500 --> 22:54.111
Hmm. You think
he'll hang the jury?

22:54.155 --> 22:57.332
No, he'll cave eventually,
but there is some good news.

22:57.376 --> 22:58.986
The real jury just
adjourned for the day,

22:59.029 --> 23:00.770
so we have one more night
to come up with something.

23:00.814 --> 23:04.165
Hmm. You know,
I've been thinking.

23:04.208 --> 23:05.906
What if I-I just kill Ed?

23:05.949 --> 23:07.516
Oh, Bull.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.388
You guys. Oh, my God,
they found Jodie.

23:09.431 --> 23:10.563
What? Who found Jodie?

23:10.606 --> 23:11.912
The treasure hunters.

23:11.955 --> 23:13.392
Treasure hunters?

23:13.435 --> 23:14.958
Yeah, the less you
know the better.

23:15.002 --> 23:16.133
What are they saying online?

23:16.177 --> 23:18.266
They dug up a barrel

23:18.309 --> 23:19.615
buried near those columns.

23:19.659 --> 23:22.139
It was a horror show, basically.

23:22.183 --> 23:24.315
Uh, bones, remains, I don't
really want to think about it,

23:24.359 --> 23:25.969
but they called the police.

23:26.013 --> 23:28.015
Whatever you did, thank you.

23:28.058 --> 23:29.799
We're gonna get him, Bull.

23:39.287 --> 23:40.636
A local treasure hunting club,

23:40.680 --> 23:42.551
on the trail
of Revolutionary War artifacts,

23:42.595 --> 23:45.032
instead made a grisly
discovery yesterday.

23:45.075 --> 23:48.035
Human remains buried in a barrel
in Saunders Woods, Pennsylvania.

23:48.078 --> 23:49.471
Am I crazy,

23:49.515 --> 23:52.561
or did you actually
sleep last night?

23:52.605 --> 23:53.823
Like a baby.

23:56.304 --> 23:58.611
Does this body they found
have anything to do with that?

24:01.135 --> 24:02.397
I can't say.

24:11.406 --> 24:13.582
Good morning.

24:13.626 --> 24:15.062
Life's too short.

24:16.063 --> 24:17.499
Yes, it is.

24:29.685 --> 24:32.688
You know, before this
gets complicated,

24:32.732 --> 24:37.214
I've got a little business
meeting this morning, so...

24:41.131 --> 24:42.481
I love you.

24:46.746 --> 24:47.790
Mm.

24:50.489 --> 24:51.577
Great work yesterday.

24:54.275 --> 24:55.668
I said great work yesterday.

24:55.711 --> 24:56.799
Thanks.

24:59.715 --> 25:01.325
It was killing me knowing
that girl was out there.

25:01.369 --> 25:02.718
Yeah. Glad it worked out.

25:04.720 --> 25:06.461
Not sure how we're gonna
do this without you.

25:07.375 --> 25:09.116
Marissa told you?

25:09.159 --> 25:10.509
I caught her crying

25:10.552 --> 25:13.076
in the bathroom.
She's pretty bummed.

25:13.120 --> 25:14.730
I am, too.

25:14.774 --> 25:15.949
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you myself.

25:15.992 --> 25:17.777
I haven't even told Bull yet.

25:17.820 --> 25:19.213
He'll hate to lose you,
but he'll get it.

25:19.256 --> 25:21.563
He's got a kid.

25:21.607 --> 25:23.870
- Oh, found a school in Hawaii?
- No.

25:23.913 --> 25:25.741
I just started looking.
It's kind of impossible

25:25.785 --> 25:28.135
because I have no idea
where I'm working yet

25:28.178 --> 25:29.179
or where I'm gonna live.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.531
- Sounds like an adventure.
- Yeah.

25:32.574 --> 25:35.185
Kind of like you and Cameron
climbing Kilimanjaro.

25:35.229 --> 25:37.710
Minus the mountain
and the hot guy.

25:37.753 --> 25:40.060
Hey, you'll have surfers
and volcanos.

25:40.103 --> 25:41.540
You're gonna be fine.

25:43.498 --> 25:45.718
Something's happening.

25:45.761 --> 25:48.808
...found in the barrel,
they were able to determine

25:48.851 --> 25:50.853
that the remains are that
of a human female.

25:50.897 --> 25:53.116
Unfortunately,
further identification

25:53.160 --> 25:55.771
is going to be impossible
because the remains

25:55.815 --> 25:57.599
have been compromised
by a chemical agent.

25:57.643 --> 25:59.949
The disappointment
is palpable...

25:59.993 --> 26:01.516
I got to call Bull.

26:01.560 --> 26:02.735
...both within the investigation
and within

26:02.778 --> 26:04.563
missing persons networks...

26:06.129 --> 26:08.088
No, I understand.

26:08.131 --> 26:09.959
Yes.

26:10.003 --> 26:11.918
Thank you, Taylor.

26:11.961 --> 26:13.615
What happened?

26:13.659 --> 26:15.704
Ed did something to the body.

26:15.748 --> 26:18.577
Acid, lye, something.
I don't know.

26:18.620 --> 26:21.754
- God.
- They can't get any DNA evidence from the remains.

26:21.797 --> 26:23.625
Ugh... Jodie's parents
are never gonna know

26:23.669 --> 26:25.584
what happened to their daughter.

26:25.627 --> 26:27.890
No one's ever gonna know
that Ed killed her

26:27.934 --> 26:29.544
and six other people
to cover it up.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.328
You did everything
you could.

26:31.372 --> 26:33.635
Doesn't matter.

26:33.679 --> 26:35.768
Ed is gonna be free
to kill again.

26:35.811 --> 26:38.379
Do you want to pass on this
meeting? I can do it alone.

26:38.422 --> 26:40.555
No, this is important.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.644
It's our future.

26:42.688 --> 26:44.385
When Marissa showed me
that she was able to predict

26:44.428 --> 26:47.214
not just the verdict but
the damages in our last trial,

26:47.257 --> 26:48.258
I-I was amazed.

26:49.695 --> 26:54.787
Yeah, uh, mock jury,
they are a critical tool.

26:54.830 --> 26:57.659
We can't wait to put it into
practice for you, Matthew.

26:57.703 --> 27:01.184
Save Wellman Hospitality
some real money next time.

27:01.228 --> 27:03.230
I've been following
your current case.

27:03.273 --> 27:06.537
The, uh, landlord accused of all
those carbon monoxide deaths?

27:06.581 --> 27:08.061
Right.

27:08.104 --> 27:09.062
- Have you?
- MATTHEW:Mm-hmm.

27:10.846 --> 27:12.413
I saw the jury is out.

27:14.894 --> 27:16.199
Which way do you think
it's gonna go?

27:17.505 --> 27:18.811
They're gonna acquit.

27:18.854 --> 27:20.639
You sound so certain. I love it.

27:22.423 --> 27:23.729
Well, our mirror juries
are accurate

27:23.772 --> 27:25.992
98% of the time.

27:26.035 --> 27:27.428
That's just,
that is really amazing,

27:27.471 --> 27:30.083
because I got to tell you,

27:30.126 --> 27:31.693
I was sure he was
gonna be convicted.

27:31.737 --> 27:33.782
You guys must be
miracle workers.

27:33.826 --> 27:36.350
I'm so sorry.
If you'll excuse me.

27:36.393 --> 27:38.787
Uh... I have to go.

27:42.573 --> 27:46.012
Okay, do I have
everyone's ballot?

27:46.055 --> 27:49.276
Sorry. Just a sec.

27:59.678 --> 28:01.854
All right,
let's count the votes.

28:12.821 --> 28:13.822
Not guilty.

28:18.348 --> 28:20.350
Not guilty.

28:21.917 --> 28:23.092
Uh, excuse me.

28:23.136 --> 28:24.877
Sorry! Sorry.

28:24.920 --> 28:26.705
Hey! Watch it!

28:29.577 --> 28:30.926
Not guilty.

28:42.982 --> 28:44.244
Not guilty.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.689
Stop! Everyone stop.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.865
Don't count those votes.

28:56.909 --> 28:59.389
Sir. Sir!
- You don't have to.

28:59.433 --> 29:00.956
My client isYou're not allowed
in there!

29:01.000 --> 29:02.392
- ...guilty.
- Sir!

29:02.436 --> 29:04.917
- Open the door!
- He did it.

29:04.960 --> 29:06.092
<i>Never,</i>

29:06.135 --> 29:07.876
in all my years on the bench,

29:07.920 --> 29:10.531
have I witnessed
such outrageous behavior.

29:10.574 --> 29:12.489
I cannot imagine

29:12.533 --> 29:15.536
a more egregious violation
of your duty to your client.

29:15.579 --> 29:17.146
If I may, Your Honor.

29:17.190 --> 29:19.758
I would like to make it clear
to this court that...

29:21.585 --> 29:23.196
...I alone made this decision.

29:23.239 --> 29:25.111
Mr. Palmer had nothing

29:25.154 --> 29:27.809
to do with any of this.

29:27.853 --> 29:31.291
None of my colleagues at TAC
had any part in this. It was...

29:31.334 --> 29:33.728
my decision.

29:33.772 --> 29:36.078
That is small comfort.

29:36.122 --> 29:39.647
Dr. Bull, I'm revoking
your courtroom privileges.

29:39.690 --> 29:42.781
You are no longer welcome
in any courtroom

29:42.824 --> 29:44.304
in this city.
Do you understand me?

29:45.696 --> 29:48.699
I understand.
Thank you, Your Honor.

29:48.743 --> 29:50.614
And now I have
no choice

29:50.658 --> 29:52.834
but to declare a mistrial.

29:52.878 --> 29:54.227
Mr. Jones, are you going

29:54.270 --> 29:56.795
to refile charges
against Mr. Wilson?

30:00.842 --> 30:03.105
Yes, Your Honor. The people

30:03.149 --> 30:05.368
remain convinced
that Mr. Wilson

30:05.412 --> 30:07.631
is responsible
for his tenants' deaths.

30:07.675 --> 30:08.981
We plan to prosecute him

30:09.024 --> 30:10.460
to the fullest extent
of the law and ask

30:10.504 --> 30:12.549
that the court take him
into custody

30:12.593 --> 30:14.377
while we refile charges.

30:14.421 --> 30:16.815
Officers, please take Mr. Wilson
into custody.

30:18.164 --> 30:19.600
Court is adjourned.

30:19.643 --> 30:21.254
You didn't beat me.

30:21.297 --> 30:24.170
I had the jury this time.
I'll have them again next time.

30:24.213 --> 30:27.129
You really think I was gonna
let you get away with this?

30:27.173 --> 30:28.609
That A.D.A.?

30:28.652 --> 30:30.219
He's not gonna stop

30:30.263 --> 30:33.483
until he learns
everything you did.

30:33.527 --> 30:35.442
OFFICER:Mr. Wilson, put your
hands behind your back.

30:35.485 --> 30:36.922
I'm gonna sue

30:36.965 --> 30:38.837
your ass off.

30:40.664 --> 30:43.015
Enjoy spending my money
in the prison commissary.

30:47.323 --> 30:49.456
I put out some feelers.

30:49.499 --> 30:51.371
I will find you the best legal
ethics attorney in the country.

30:51.414 --> 30:54.417
We are going to get you
back in the courtroom.

30:54.461 --> 30:56.071
I'm not going back.

30:56.115 --> 30:57.986
Uh, we'll find a loophole.

30:58.030 --> 31:00.075
Uh, y-you pull rabbits
out of your hat all the time.

31:01.076 --> 31:03.252
No more rabbits.

31:03.296 --> 31:04.688
You don't break
the cardinal rule

31:04.732 --> 31:06.865
of attorney-client privilege

31:06.908 --> 31:09.955
and keep working
in this legal profession.

31:11.652 --> 31:13.654
He's not wrong.

31:13.697 --> 31:16.265
Bull. What about TAC?

31:16.309 --> 31:18.267
Clients will fire TAC
if I stick around.

31:18.311 --> 31:20.008
No, you'll talk them out of it.
Wh-- I will talk them out of it.

31:20.052 --> 31:21.096
No.

31:23.316 --> 31:25.927
The only way for TAC to survive
is without me.

31:28.495 --> 31:30.018
This was my last case.

31:45.773 --> 31:47.731
Oh, my God.
Are you kidding me?

31:48.950 --> 31:52.475
Uh, he's... he's really leaving?

31:52.519 --> 31:54.260
Bull's leaving TAC.

31:55.783 --> 31:57.480
Um...

31:58.786 --> 32:00.657
Will there even
still be a TAC?

32:08.491 --> 32:10.450
I'm gonna buy Bull out.

32:11.451 --> 32:13.670
Chunk, I'm...

32:13.714 --> 32:15.934
I'm hoping you'll stay on
as chief counsel.

32:18.371 --> 32:20.764
I-I'm not going anywhere.

32:22.418 --> 32:23.811
I do have one condition, though.

32:25.160 --> 32:27.336
Dibs on Bull's office. Chunk.

32:27.380 --> 32:28.947
Dude.

32:28.990 --> 32:30.035
Too soon.

32:30.078 --> 32:32.080
Oh, thank you. I needed that.

32:35.388 --> 32:36.519
So...

32:38.739 --> 32:40.393
...how's your day going?

32:40.436 --> 32:44.005
Oh, you know,
same old, same old.

32:44.049 --> 32:45.485
Mm-hmm.

32:48.444 --> 32:50.098
Are you okay?

32:51.839 --> 32:54.189
I am swell.

32:56.409 --> 32:59.107
But I do realize that a husband
should probably talk to his wife

32:59.151 --> 33:02.632
before he torpedoes his career.

33:04.069 --> 33:06.593
Well, you're not
the average husband.

33:06.636 --> 33:09.335
And if you would've
consulted me,

33:09.378 --> 33:12.338
I would've driven you
to that courthouse myself.

33:12.381 --> 33:14.253
Really?

33:14.296 --> 33:16.385
You could've slit that man's
throat for all I care.

33:17.647 --> 33:19.040
Remind me never to cross you.

33:24.828 --> 33:26.308
I love you.

33:26.352 --> 33:29.050
And I love you.

33:29.094 --> 33:30.617
Just don't start
hanging around the house

33:30.660 --> 33:33.315
all day in your underpants.

33:33.359 --> 33:35.143
But they're really
nice underpants.

33:37.580 --> 33:40.018
All right.

33:40.061 --> 33:41.758
No more underpants.

33:41.802 --> 33:43.543
Mm.

33:46.894 --> 33:48.330
Chunk?

33:48.374 --> 33:50.071
<i>Thought you'd like to know,</i>

33:50.115 --> 33:52.073
a woman came to the police
today. Kristi Walker.

33:52.117 --> 33:54.119
Apparently, she heard
about your dramatic display

33:54.162 --> 33:55.555
in the jury room
and was inspired

33:55.598 --> 33:57.774
to get a few things
off her chest.

33:57.818 --> 33:59.646
Well, you need
to protect her.

33:59.689 --> 34:01.474
I will.
Ed Wilson's behind bars,

34:01.517 --> 34:03.432
and I'm confident
I can keep him there

34:03.476 --> 34:05.217
for the rest
of his life.

34:05.260 --> 34:06.261
Kristi must've had
some pretty damning evidence.

34:06.305 --> 34:08.481
Yes, but I'm sure you knew that.

34:08.524 --> 34:12.093
And based on what Kristi shared,
we learned that, uh, Wilson

34:12.137 --> 34:13.486
was a person of interest
in the disappearance

34:13.529 --> 34:15.401
of a young woman
Jodie Comroe,

34:15.444 --> 34:20.058
but that Nicholas Borrego,
his handyman, alibied him.

34:21.189 --> 34:22.364
Huh.

34:22.408 --> 34:24.497
Blink twice
if I'm getting warm.

34:24.540 --> 34:26.238
I can't do your whole job
for you.

34:26.281 --> 34:27.891
That's fine.

34:27.935 --> 34:29.893
Some treasure hunters
discovered human remains

34:29.937 --> 34:32.853
in the woods not far from where

34:32.896 --> 34:36.813
Jodie Comroe's car was abandoned
on the night she vanished.

34:36.857 --> 34:38.728
Wasn't that lucky?

34:38.772 --> 34:41.949
Wasn't it? I did see something
about that on the news.

34:41.992 --> 34:44.082
But they couldn't identify
the body, something to do with

34:44.125 --> 34:46.258
DNA being compromised?

34:46.301 --> 34:48.608
We discovered a titanium screw
in the barrel,

34:48.651 --> 34:50.131
the same kind of screw

34:50.175 --> 34:51.698
that Jodie had
from a knee surgery.

34:51.741 --> 34:53.439
They're tracing
the serial numbers now.

34:53.482 --> 34:56.398
And you think the parents,
they'll get closure?

34:57.878 --> 34:59.271
Yeah, I think they will.

35:00.707 --> 35:02.187
You know, I wouldn't have
been able to figure out

35:02.230 --> 35:04.102
any of this stuff
without your, um...

35:05.712 --> 35:07.105
Eh, what do you call it?

35:07.148 --> 35:09.324
Bravery-- No. Stupidity? No.

35:09.368 --> 35:12.153
Ah. Insanity.

35:12.197 --> 35:13.850
There's no need to label it.

35:13.894 --> 35:15.156
Yeah.

35:17.158 --> 35:18.507
Well.

35:20.292 --> 35:21.815
Pleasure doing business
with you, Dr. Bull.

35:21.858 --> 35:23.556
Always a pleasure.

35:28.343 --> 35:30.258
Chester.

35:33.696 --> 35:35.133
I always liked that guy.

35:35.176 --> 35:36.438
You never liked that guy.

35:36.482 --> 35:39.441
Well, if he puts Ed behind bars,

35:39.485 --> 35:42.009
I will love him forever.

35:42.052 --> 35:43.271
You know,
I never would have done

35:43.315 --> 35:45.882
what you did today, but, uh...

35:45.926 --> 35:47.362
I'm really glad you did it.

35:47.406 --> 35:49.756
I wouldn't spread that around.

35:49.799 --> 35:51.758
My stink might stick to you.

35:51.801 --> 35:55.849
Oh, no, I plan to very publicly,
very loudly condemn you.

35:55.892 --> 35:57.894
- Good.
- But, uh,

35:57.938 --> 35:59.157
between you and me?

36:01.376 --> 36:02.943
I'm really proud
to have worked for you.

36:09.515 --> 36:11.343
Mr. Palmer.

36:14.041 --> 36:16.957
You're not just a good attorney.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.786
You're a great attorney.

36:38.631 --> 36:40.198
Hold that elevator?

36:43.026 --> 36:44.680
Quite a day.

36:49.294 --> 36:50.512
Feel like a drink?

36:58.564 --> 37:00.174
So...

37:00.218 --> 37:03.177
Hawai'i, huh?

37:03.221 --> 37:05.614
That's hardly
the news of the day.

37:05.658 --> 37:07.399
Yeah, sorry, I didn't mean
to steal your thunder

37:07.442 --> 37:11.664
with the whole
"leaving TAC" drama.

37:11.707 --> 37:13.622
Yeah, I had the spotlight
for what, like, two minutes?

37:13.666 --> 37:15.755
Yeah, I'm very selfish.

37:15.798 --> 37:18.192
Well...

37:18.236 --> 37:20.586
which one of us is
headed to paradise?

37:20.629 --> 37:21.630
Fair enough.

37:25.025 --> 37:27.245
And what about you?

37:27.288 --> 37:29.638
- Where are you headed?
- Oh.

37:29.682 --> 37:31.684
Might disappear for a while.

37:31.727 --> 37:34.295
Someplace not even you
can find me.

37:36.123 --> 37:38.299
I can always find you.

37:43.391 --> 37:47.221
Hey.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.310
You know, some
religions believe

37:49.354 --> 37:50.355
that if you save
someone's life...

37:50.398 --> 37:52.226
Oh, you still think
you saved my life

37:52.270 --> 37:54.010
when my daughter was kidnapped?

37:55.360 --> 37:57.884
If you save someone's life,

37:57.927 --> 38:00.103
you are responsible
for them forever.

38:00.147 --> 38:02.018
Well, I'm telling you
I saved my own life,

38:02.062 --> 38:03.977
- so you're off the hook there.
- I'm not saying

38:04.020 --> 38:06.936
I saved you.

38:06.980 --> 38:08.503
You saved me.

38:10.288 --> 38:11.637
When you gave me this job.

38:13.639 --> 38:15.423
Um...

38:15.467 --> 38:19.601
I was in a rough place,
and you...

38:19.645 --> 38:22.909
you gave me a reason
to get up in the morning.

38:22.952 --> 38:24.476
So thank you.

38:27.653 --> 38:31.439
Well, if I'm responsible
for you, then I think you

38:31.483 --> 38:33.572
should rethink this whole
mountain climbing thing,

38:33.615 --> 38:37.184
because that puts
a lot of pressure on me.

38:43.408 --> 38:45.105
I understand.
Thanks, Matthew.

38:45.148 --> 38:47.325
I wish you all the best. Bye.

38:48.978 --> 38:50.632
That was Wellman?
They dropped us?

38:50.676 --> 38:53.505
I mean, TAC?Yeah.

38:53.548 --> 38:55.507
Yeah.

38:55.550 --> 38:57.509
Did you tell him I resigned?

38:57.552 --> 38:59.380
I did, but the ship had sailed.

38:59.424 --> 39:01.164
Yeah.

39:01.208 --> 39:03.384
I'm sorry to have cost you
a client that massive.

39:03.428 --> 39:04.994
I'm not worried.

39:05.038 --> 39:07.780
I landed a big fish once,
I will do it again.

39:07.823 --> 39:10.348
I have no doubt about that.

39:12.219 --> 39:16.789
Bull, I just, I just...
want to tell you,

39:16.832 --> 39:20.227
being your partner
these last few months, it...

39:20.270 --> 39:21.489
it has meant everything to me.

39:23.709 --> 39:26.189
You've been my partner
for 13 years.

39:29.628 --> 39:32.152
I can't imagine doing this
without you.

39:32.195 --> 39:36.025
Well, I think we both know
that I needed you

39:36.069 --> 39:38.332
a lot more than you needed me.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.427
I would like to give you something.

39:48.211 --> 39:49.343
Something important.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.563
Something I think
you're gonna need.

39:51.606 --> 39:53.521
I leave it with you.

39:54.740 --> 39:56.959
For me?

39:57.003 --> 39:58.004
Yeah, it's for you.

40:03.052 --> 40:04.576
- Take good care of it, will you?
- I will.

40:04.619 --> 40:06.578
Okay.

40:06.621 --> 40:08.493
I kind of don't know
what to do now.

40:08.536 --> 40:09.755
- Oh, hug me.
- Oh.

40:11.757 --> 40:12.801
Good luck.

40:12.845 --> 40:14.281
Thank you.
