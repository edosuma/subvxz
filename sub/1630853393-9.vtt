00:06.006 --> 00:07.465
It's juror number seven, isn't it?

00:07.549 --> 00:11.094
-All I know is he's bought and paid for.
-I thought you had investors.

00:11.177 --> 00:12.512
Not the kind you're thinking of.

00:12.595 --> 00:16.349
I had a roommate in college
named Pavel Kosevich. I know.

00:16.433 --> 00:19.019
His father's name is Sergei Kosevich.

00:19.102 --> 00:21.312
This is not a man you fuck with, Mickey.

00:21.396 --> 00:23.148
Maybe juror number seven's dead.

00:23.231 --> 00:26.276
Did you think of that?
Maybe you and I are next.

00:26.359 --> 00:27.736
Who did this to you?

00:27.819 --> 00:30.572
Without your witness, Soto walks.

00:30.655 --> 00:32.741
Bail will be set at $2 million.

00:32.824 --> 00:36.870
Tanya, did Soto do anything
to confirm he had your friend killed?

00:36.953 --> 00:42.000
The night before your witness was killed,
I drove him to the same flower shop.

00:42.917 --> 00:45.336
There's not enough
on the phone to nail him.

00:45.420 --> 00:46.921
We gotta get him to turn on Soto.

00:47.005 --> 00:49.382
Do you know why
Lara Elliott reached out to you?

00:49.466 --> 00:53.094
She just said she had something
to tell me and needed to do it in person.

00:53.178 --> 00:55.305
Did Mr. Elliott seem worried or panicked?

00:55.388 --> 00:58.475
No. But it looked
like he was scrolling through his email.

00:58.558 --> 01:01.227
We had this case won
and you threw it away.

01:01.311 --> 01:03.813
Tell me something.
How do you sleep at night?

01:04.439 --> 01:07.817
I'm going to enjoy
watching the jury convict your client.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.403
We established that
this vehicle was not cleaned.

01:10.487 --> 01:13.490
Could that account for
the gunshot residue on my client's hands?

01:13.573 --> 01:15.784
Given the staggering amount of GSR,

01:15.867 --> 01:18.119
it's the only thing
that could account for it.

01:18.203 --> 01:21.122
<i>What's it like, the moment</i>
<i>when you know you've won?</i>

01:21.206 --> 01:22.832
You never really know for sure.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.210
<i>We missed you last night at the meeting.</i>

01:25.293 --> 01:27.295
My ex is in town,
doing a show. We had dinner.

01:27.378 --> 01:28.338
How did that go?

01:28.421 --> 01:32.175
She asked me to get high with her.
I came within a millimeter of saying yes.

01:32.258 --> 01:34.552
I need to win
in the court of public opinion.

01:34.636 --> 01:36.221
No lawyer can give you that.

01:36.304 --> 01:37.889
That's why I need to testify.

01:55.907 --> 01:59.369
Woke up in my clothes.
Haven't done that in a while.

01:59.452 --> 02:00.662
In a teenager's room.

02:01.746 --> 02:05.458
Tell your daughter she's got good taste
in music. I am down for the K-pop.

02:08.002 --> 02:09.129
Thanks for the rescue.

02:10.630 --> 02:13.341
-Was that a stumble or a fall?
-A stumble.

02:14.050 --> 02:16.803
I called my sponsor
and I'm going to a meeting. Promise.

02:16.886 --> 02:17.846
Good.

02:19.013 --> 02:22.600
I don't want you worrying about me.
You got a trial to win, right?

02:22.684 --> 02:24.853
Yeah. Maybe. Maybe not.

02:25.645 --> 02:26.729
I miss something?

02:28.857 --> 02:32.402
My client wants to testify.
Can't talk him out of it.

02:32.485 --> 02:34.612
Isn't that what you're not supposed to do?

02:34.696 --> 02:39.117
It's like boxing. We won the fight
on points, but my guy wants to brawl.

02:39.200 --> 02:43.204
I just have to convince him
to play defense and not get knocked out.

02:45.915 --> 02:49.627
-You going in early? I'll take you.
-No, you take yourself to that meeting.

02:49.711 --> 02:53.548
I'll drop you off at your car.
Part of my generous benefits package.

02:55.967 --> 02:57.969
Your wife was sleeping with another man,

02:58.052 --> 03:02.056
you expect this jury to believe that you
found them naked in bed, shot to death?

03:02.140 --> 03:03.141
That's what happened.

03:03.224 --> 03:05.685
You went there
'cause you knew they'd be together.

03:05.768 --> 03:06.603
No.

03:06.686 --> 03:09.022
You crept up the stairs
with a .45 and confronted them?

03:09.105 --> 03:11.733
No. I found them dead.

03:11.816 --> 03:15.361
-I told--
-You shot Jan Rilz first, point blank.

03:15.445 --> 03:16.446
No.

03:16.529 --> 03:18.698
Your wife begged for her life,
you killed her too?

03:18.781 --> 03:20.533
No! No!

03:24.287 --> 03:27.457
I have to get you ready
for cross-examination, you understand?

03:27.540 --> 03:30.668
Golantz has nothing to lose, Trevor.
He's already bleeding.

03:30.752 --> 03:32.629
Why are you offering him your throat?

03:32.712 --> 03:34.881
Mickey, I told you this
from the beginning.

03:35.965 --> 03:39.177
I will not spend the rest of my life

03:39.260 --> 03:42.722
hearing people whisper,
"Did he do it?" behind my back.

03:42.805 --> 03:44.933
I'm gonna do that whether you win or lose.

03:45.016 --> 03:46.351
-Yeah. Lorna.
-Uh.

03:48.436 --> 03:51.564
Whatever Golantz
throws at you, your job, Trevor,

03:51.648 --> 03:54.108
is to tell the jury
how much you loved your wife.

03:54.192 --> 03:57.278
All right? Now you do that,
maybe we can pull this off.

04:12.543 --> 04:14.462
-Hey.

04:14.545 --> 04:17.257
-I read your closing.
-And?

04:17.340 --> 04:20.260
It's good. It's thorough.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.262
-You hate it.
-No, I…

04:22.345 --> 04:25.223
You hate it. Come on.
Just give it to me straight, Lorna.

04:25.306 --> 04:29.143
It's about gunshot residue
and forensic analysis.

04:29.227 --> 04:31.562
That's my defense.
I don't have anything else.

04:31.646 --> 04:32.939
That's Jerry's defense.

04:35.316 --> 04:39.487
Just… It doesn't feel like you.

04:39.570 --> 04:43.074
I know. But I've got my entire career
riding on this and he…

04:43.157 --> 04:46.869
This whole time, I just feel
like I'm wearing a dead man's suit.

04:46.953 --> 04:49.205
That's disgusting.
Don't say that in court.

04:49.289 --> 04:53.334
Sometimes, you just gotta
ride the horse you rode in on.

04:55.086 --> 04:56.296
I gotta go.

04:57.422 --> 05:01.092
Call my parole officer.
Where is he?

05:02.552 --> 05:03.720
This is bullshit.

05:06.264 --> 05:07.473
You got nothin'.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.769
Violate me or let me go.

05:11.853 --> 05:14.647
You done, Alvin?
'Cause you're giving me a headache.

05:23.406 --> 05:26.826
So… this is you.

05:28.619 --> 05:33.374
This is where David Loresca was killed
ten minutes later, a block away.

05:33.458 --> 05:36.252
That is a hell of a coincidence.

05:37.211 --> 05:39.839
We got you at the scene, Alvin.

05:40.882 --> 05:43.384
With your record, you're looking at life.

05:44.635 --> 05:45.636
However…

05:47.638 --> 05:49.265
we know that it was a job.

05:50.266 --> 05:52.602
We know who paid you. We know why.

05:53.353 --> 05:54.687
And that's who we want.

05:56.314 --> 06:00.234
Okay? So you just
have to help us help you.

06:02.278 --> 06:04.155
Just give it up, Alvin.

06:05.406 --> 06:07.742
You know we can make this all go away.

06:19.003 --> 06:23.049
I knew my phone was acting weird
after that bullshit search.

06:24.467 --> 06:25.385
Yeah.

06:27.011 --> 06:28.388
I was there.

06:29.847 --> 06:31.474
Making a delivery.

06:32.767 --> 06:34.018
Call my boss.

06:35.686 --> 06:36.896
Better yet…

06:38.856 --> 06:41.859
call Father Cruz at St. Lorenzo's.

06:45.988 --> 06:47.281
He signed for it.

06:57.625 --> 06:59.043
Bullshit, but it checks out.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.754
How long have we got?

07:01.838 --> 07:04.340
He burned his phone call
thinking it was a parole beef,

07:04.424 --> 07:05.633
we can hold him for ten hours.

07:05.716 --> 07:07.593
As soon as we
cut him loose, he'll tell Soto.

07:07.677 --> 07:08.719
Soto'll circle the wagons.

07:08.803 --> 07:11.013
Won't take him long
to figure out who turned on him.

07:11.097 --> 07:14.600
Maybe not though. Right now, Alvin thinks
someone in his gang snitched him out,

07:14.684 --> 07:16.769
so maybe they'll go
on a witch-hunt there instead.

07:16.853 --> 07:19.147
Okay. That's good.

07:19.981 --> 07:22.442
Use that to scare him
before you let him go.

07:22.525 --> 07:24.193
Give Soto something else to worry about.

07:24.277 --> 07:27.071
-Wait, where you going?
-To throw a Hail Mary.

07:30.032 --> 07:31.742
You want my client
to wear a wire?

07:31.826 --> 07:34.036
I don't have a choice.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.789
You do.
Tell fucking Lankford to go to hell.

07:36.873 --> 07:40.751
It's my idea, Mickey. She's
the only person Soto might open up to.

07:40.835 --> 07:43.796
You want to make a pregnant woman
collateral damage, Maggie?

07:43.880 --> 07:48.217
You're judging me?
The tactics I've seen you pull in cases…

07:48.301 --> 07:50.470
Now I see where Hayley gets her ideas.

07:50.553 --> 07:52.889
I do what I have to do
for my clients, Maggie.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.390
Really? What about Eli Wyms?

07:55.266 --> 07:57.727
-What?
-People talk at the DA's office.

07:57.810 --> 08:00.771
You stuck him in a psych ward
until you could spring him on Golantz.

08:00.855 --> 08:03.816
-He wasn't collateral damage?
-That was Jerry. Wasn't me.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.319
Bottom line, it's her call, Mickey.

08:06.402 --> 08:10.364
Maggie, you sent her to me because
you knew I would take care of her.

08:10.448 --> 08:13.284
-Right? Now you just want me to roll over?
-This is taking care of her.

08:13.367 --> 08:15.453
She needs to get out
from under this thing.

08:17.371 --> 08:20.750
All right, fine.
You want Tanya to wear a wire?

08:20.833 --> 08:22.585
If, for some reason, she agrees,

08:22.668 --> 08:24.545
the second
she gets a confession, she's done.

08:24.629 --> 08:27.632
-Meaning?
-She never has to testify against Soto.

08:27.715 --> 08:30.968
-And you relocate her immediately.
-I don't know if I can do that.

08:31.052 --> 08:34.263
This is not negotiable, Maggie.
The guy kills witnesses.

08:37.225 --> 08:39.560
Okay. Okay.

08:39.644 --> 08:43.314
Good. I'll sit with her in a few days,
and I'll explain everything--

08:43.397 --> 08:46.025
-This has to happen today.
-I'm in the middle of a trial.

08:46.108 --> 08:47.235
Then I'll talk to her.

08:47.318 --> 08:51.697
You want me to let the DA talk to my
client about wearing a wire without me?

08:51.781 --> 08:55.034
-No. Hell no.
-I'm not the DA. I'm me.

08:57.245 --> 09:00.122
You wanna rebuild things?
You want me to trust you again?

09:00.206 --> 09:03.584
Then start by trusting me. Okay?

09:07.588 --> 09:09.674
<i>What do you want from me, Cisco?</i>

09:09.757 --> 09:11.926
<i>My client is insisting</i>
<i>on taking the stand.</i>

09:12.009 --> 09:13.678
Yeah, well, I don't get it, Mick.

09:14.679 --> 09:15.930
Hey, babe.

09:16.013 --> 09:20.226
If this guy blows up his own case,
Sergei Kosevich is gonna kill him.

09:21.143 --> 09:22.770
What does he have? A death wish?

09:22.853 --> 09:25.856
I don't have time to figure out
the answer to that right now.

09:25.940 --> 09:28.276
<i>Well, how about you?</i>
<i>Do you have one?</i>

09:28.359 --> 09:32.113
Because this guy's putting a target
on your back and your family, too.

09:32.196 --> 09:35.825
I don't have a choice, Cisco.
I've got to do what my client wants.

09:35.908 --> 09:39.036
And Hayley and Maggie,
they're safe. At least for now.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.538
<i>Oh, yeah? How do you know?</i>

09:41.330 --> 09:44.208
Because I've got people watching them.

09:45.001 --> 09:47.169
-Who?
<i>-It doesn't matter, Cisco.</i>

09:47.253 --> 09:50.673
The best way I can keep everybody
safe is to get my client an acquittal.

09:50.756 --> 09:53.801
That's what I'm gonna do.
All right? So just wish me luck.

10:30.254 --> 10:33.341
Excuse me. Haller. You got a minute?

10:40.264 --> 10:43.726
Voluntary manslaughter.
Eleven years. Probably do nine.

10:43.809 --> 10:46.020
I know you think
you've got me over a barrel,

10:46.103 --> 10:48.105
but you never know what a jury's gonna do.

10:49.774 --> 10:50.983
That's it?

10:51.817 --> 10:53.778
You're not much of a salesman, are you?

10:56.614 --> 10:58.574
I'm not used to having to be one.

11:01.952 --> 11:05.414
I'll take it to my client,
but knowing him, don't hold your breath.

11:21.180 --> 11:22.181
All rise!

11:28.896 --> 11:29.730
Be seated.

11:36.237 --> 11:39.865
Mr. Haller, any more evidence to present?

11:43.911 --> 11:47.540
Just have one more witness, Your Honor.

11:50.668 --> 11:52.128
Defense calls Trevor Elliott.

12:20.948 --> 12:22.450
Raise your right hand.

12:23.451 --> 12:28.914
Do you solemnly state that the testimony
you may give shall be the truth,

12:28.998 --> 12:31.000
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

12:31.083 --> 12:32.084
I do.

12:35.629 --> 12:38.674
Mr. Elliott, I think the jury
is well aware of who you are.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.302
Tell us what you do for a living?

12:41.385 --> 12:45.306
Of course. I run a company called Parallax

12:46.182 --> 12:48.058
that I founded with my wife, Lara.

12:48.142 --> 12:49.518
We make video games.

12:49.602 --> 12:52.646
And what is your biggest
selling game to date?

12:52.730 --> 12:54.273
It's called <i>Nocturna.</i>

12:54.356 --> 12:59.111
It's a journey through a post-apocalyptic
America cloaked in perpetual darkness.

12:59.195 --> 13:00.571
And this is fun for people?

13:03.866 --> 13:06.827
Yeah, so much so,
we're about to launch a sequel.

13:08.078 --> 13:10.289
In your opinion,
what makes the game special?

13:11.040 --> 13:13.709
Well, if you ask the players,
it's the characters.

13:15.127 --> 13:17.588
They look like real people.

13:17.671 --> 13:22.009
In a way that when we started, other
video games couldn't compete with it.

13:22.092 --> 13:24.595
It's like a movie that you play a part in.

13:25.346 --> 13:29.850
And in <i>Nocturna,</i> who would be
considered the star of the movie?

13:29.934 --> 13:33.354
Sure, the hero's name is Jasmine Lumens.

13:34.438 --> 13:37.733
But her image is based on my wife, Lara.

13:38.275 --> 13:41.111
I designed the character after her
as a way to honor her,

13:42.279 --> 13:45.741
and how much I loved her.
How much she inspired me.

13:49.370 --> 13:51.372
How did you meet your wife, Mr. Elliott?

13:52.540 --> 13:55.251
We met in grad school, at Stanford.

13:56.877 --> 14:01.423
I was in front of the room,
working on a problem up on the board.

14:02.424 --> 14:07.596
When I'd finished, the professor
immediately erased the entire thing

14:08.347 --> 14:10.683
because I'd made
a fundamental error. It was…

14:11.517 --> 14:13.143
humiliating.

14:13.227 --> 14:14.645
And what happened then?

14:15.771 --> 14:19.441
Lara raised her hand and said
that she'd made the same mistake.

14:19.525 --> 14:20.734
It made me feel better.

14:22.403 --> 14:27.575
Until I was walking past her desk
and happened to glance at her screen,

14:28.450 --> 14:29.994
and she got the problem right.

14:32.997 --> 14:34.206
But that was Lara.

14:41.213 --> 14:42.631
What was your marriage like?

14:44.884 --> 14:46.093
Well, it wasn't perfect.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.430
We had problems like any couple.

14:50.806 --> 14:52.391
What kind of problems?

14:57.980 --> 15:00.190
Infidelity, for one.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.361
I knew she was having the affair.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.533
-Did you tell the police that?
-No.

15:09.617 --> 15:10.492
Why not?

15:11.869 --> 15:16.081
Because I knew it would make me
look like an angry, jealous husband,

15:16.165 --> 15:17.291
and that wasn't true.

15:18.459 --> 15:19.418
I'd forgiven her.

15:20.920 --> 15:21.754
Why?

15:23.130 --> 15:25.507
Because her affair was my fault.

15:27.301 --> 15:28.302
See, I…

15:29.178 --> 15:34.058
I was working all the time.
And ignoring her.

15:35.476 --> 15:39.063
And I had also been unfaithful.

15:40.522 --> 15:43.192
-You had affairs?
-Yes.

15:44.902 --> 15:48.572
I was not a perfect husband
in any way, shape, or form.

15:50.366 --> 15:52.409
And I felt so lucky every day

15:53.243 --> 15:59.083
that Lara was able to look past that
and see me for the man I was trying to be

16:00.209 --> 16:02.252
and not the man I sometimes was.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.508
Why did you go out
to the house that day, Mr. Elliott?

16:10.135 --> 16:11.345
I went out there…

16:14.723 --> 16:16.183
to fight for my wife.

16:18.185 --> 16:20.479
To try and save our marriage.

16:22.189 --> 16:23.315
Instead…

16:26.902 --> 16:28.988
I found them dead.

16:30.239 --> 16:31.699
Both of them.

16:44.461 --> 16:48.257
People would not oppose a break,
so Mr. Elliott can gather himself.

16:48.340 --> 16:49.842
Unnecessary, Judge.

16:51.176 --> 16:55.264
Mr. Elliott…
I only have one more question.

16:57.474 --> 16:58.684
Did you kill your wife?

17:01.061 --> 17:02.312
God, no.

17:05.482 --> 17:06.692
I love her.

17:10.612 --> 17:12.656
I loved her.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.308
Cross-examination.

17:43.812 --> 17:47.357
Mr. Elliott, you told the police
that you and your wife

17:47.441 --> 17:50.235
had an argument the night
before the murders. Is that correct?

17:50.903 --> 17:52.154
Yes.

17:52.237 --> 17:54.406
Contrary to
what you told the police,

17:54.490 --> 17:57.242
you just testified that that argument
was about her affair.

17:58.368 --> 17:59.703
That's correct.

17:59.787 --> 18:04.958
Now, you also told the police that you
drove out to the Malibu house the next day

18:05.042 --> 18:08.754
to surprise Lara
with a trip up the coast. Is that right?

18:09.588 --> 18:10.422
Yes.

18:11.090 --> 18:14.635
Is that in fact true, or another
thing you lied to the police about?

18:14.718 --> 18:17.096
-Objection. Argumentative?
-I'll move on.

18:17.179 --> 18:21.725
Prior to driving out to your house
that day, did you make any reservations?

18:23.060 --> 18:24.061
Reservations?

18:25.020 --> 18:29.316
At a hotel?
Or a restaurant? For your trip.

18:30.400 --> 18:33.904
Yeah, not that I can recall.
I was trying to be spontaneous.

18:33.987 --> 18:38.534
The People would like to enter
into evidence, the People's exhibit 21.

18:39.660 --> 18:40.744
So entered.

18:43.872 --> 18:46.250
Is this your appointment
calendar, Mr. Elliott?

18:47.876 --> 18:50.504
That looks to be a printout of it, yes.

18:50.587 --> 18:54.967
Could you please turn to the day
of the murder, September 6th of last year?

18:55.843 --> 18:58.387
Do you see
the list of meetings for that day?

18:58.470 --> 18:59.346
Yes.

19:00.347 --> 19:01.807
How many are there?

19:02.558 --> 19:04.059
Uh, seven.

19:04.143 --> 19:07.146
Now, did you cancel
any of those seven meetings

19:07.229 --> 19:10.816
before getting in the car
to surprise your wife with the trip?

19:10.899 --> 19:13.527
I wasn't thinking about that.
We just had a fight.

19:13.610 --> 19:15.237
It's a yes or no question.

19:15.320 --> 19:18.240
Did you or did you not
clear your calendar that day?

19:20.075 --> 19:21.743
No, I don't believe I did.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.954
You knew Jan Rilz was with your wife

19:24.037 --> 19:26.373
when you drove out to the house
that day, didn't you?

19:27.040 --> 19:28.083
No.

19:30.419 --> 19:33.005
This is People's exhibit 22.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.091
The security camera log.

19:39.428 --> 19:40.762
Now, isn't it a fact

19:40.846 --> 19:44.474
that you knew the cameras at your
Malibu house were turned off that morning?

19:45.434 --> 19:49.479
I knew about the affair. I didn't know
Rilz was going to be at the house.

19:49.563 --> 19:54.860
Your testimony is that you weren't upset
because you had been unfaithful yourself?

19:55.736 --> 19:57.487
Well, yes.

19:58.822 --> 20:01.241
Did you and Lara Elliott
have a prenuptial agreement?

20:01.325 --> 20:02.159
No.

20:02.242 --> 20:03.952
So if your wife divorced you,

20:04.036 --> 20:06.663
she would've been entitled
to half of your fortune, right?

20:06.747 --> 20:10.000
Objection. Mr. Elliott
is not an expert in family law.

20:10.626 --> 20:11.627
Sustained.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.342
The night before the murders,

20:19.676 --> 20:22.012
did your wife tell you
she was meeting Sonia Patel?

20:22.095 --> 20:22.930
No.

20:23.013 --> 20:27.476
Isn't it a fact that you were afraid
that she was talking about divorcing you?

20:27.559 --> 20:30.520
Perhaps asking an old friend
how to protect herself financially?

20:30.604 --> 20:33.815
-Objection. Calls for speculation.
-I'll rephrase the question.

20:33.899 --> 20:39.029
Mr. Elliott, do you know why your wife
reached out to Sonia Patel?

20:39.112 --> 20:44.868
No. Lara hadn't seen Sonia in years.
I don't know why she contacted her.

20:46.286 --> 20:49.248
-Do you own a gun, Mr. Elliott?
-No.

20:49.331 --> 20:53.335
-Have you ever fired a gun?
-I was raised by a couple of ex-hippies.

20:53.418 --> 20:55.671
I wasn't even allowed
to have a water pistol.

20:55.754 --> 20:59.424
So your answer is no?
No experience with firearms?

20:59.508 --> 21:00.384
Correct.

21:01.301 --> 21:05.555
The People would like to enter
into evidence, People's exhibit 23.

21:10.727 --> 21:13.814
Now, this is Mr. Elliott's game, <i>Nocturna.</i>

21:14.564 --> 21:18.277
Now, I'm not much of a gamer,
so I want to focus on this one moment.

21:19.403 --> 21:22.197
<i>Take the gun. You might need it.</i>

21:25.867 --> 21:28.245
This is the first time
the hero picks up a gun?

21:28.328 --> 21:29.162
Yes.

21:29.913 --> 21:33.125
The gun that would become
her primary weapon throughout the game.

21:34.459 --> 21:37.087
Can you tell the court
what kind of gun that is?

21:37.170 --> 21:38.213
What kind?

21:39.006 --> 21:40.882
The brand and caliber
of the weapon?

21:40.966 --> 21:42.426
Sidebar, Your Honor?

21:48.640 --> 21:52.602
Your Honor, is my client being tried
on an Xbox or in a court of law?

21:52.686 --> 21:55.105
This goes directly
to the heart of the People's case.

21:55.188 --> 21:57.107
It's misleading and prejudicial.

21:57.190 --> 22:02.237
Indeed, it would be. If Mr. Golantz had
tried to enter this in his case in chief.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.698
But he did not.
Your client opened that door

22:04.781 --> 22:07.659
when he testified that he had
no experience with firearms.

22:07.743 --> 22:10.370
I want my objection
noted on the record for appeal.

22:10.454 --> 22:11.455
Noted.

22:12.873 --> 22:14.249
The witness may answer.

22:16.918 --> 22:20.839
Ah, I believe it's a Heckler & Koch,
.45 caliber.

22:20.922 --> 22:23.258
An HK .45 semi-automatic.

22:24.885 --> 22:26.845
That's the same gun that police believe

22:26.928 --> 22:29.681
was used to kill
Lara Elliott and Jan Rilz, isn't it?

22:30.640 --> 22:33.935
I wouldn't know. I guess,
if that's what's on the police report.

22:34.019 --> 22:36.855
Did your company own
a Heckler & Koch .45 semi-automatic

22:36.938 --> 22:38.398
used as a model for this gun?

22:39.149 --> 22:39.983
No.

22:40.067 --> 22:42.819
So a search
of your company's business transactions

22:42.903 --> 22:44.821
wouldn't reveal any such purchase?

22:44.905 --> 22:46.365
No, it would not.

22:46.448 --> 22:50.535
And the fact that it was the same
exact gun, that's just a coincidence then?

22:50.619 --> 22:52.329
Objection. Argumentative.

22:55.749 --> 22:57.125
I'll withdraw the question.

22:59.086 --> 23:00.712
Nothing further, Your Honor.

23:03.673 --> 23:06.051
-Redirect?
-No, Your Honor.

23:07.636 --> 23:10.806
Very well.
Court will take a 30-minute recess.

23:10.889 --> 23:12.599
Then we'll hear closing arguments.

23:27.739 --> 23:28.782
-Hey.
-Hey.

23:30.492 --> 23:34.287
-Mickey said all I have to do is listen.
-That's right.

23:36.540 --> 23:38.166
Did you go to the flower shop?

23:38.250 --> 23:42.546
Yes. And it led us to the man
we believe shot David Loresca.

23:42.629 --> 23:44.339
Then you got what you need.

23:45.090 --> 23:47.384
I wish it were that simple.

23:50.011 --> 23:53.390
Listen, I want Angelo Soto
to pay for his crimes, Tanya.

23:53.473 --> 23:55.934
That's my job. I don't apologize for it.

23:56.768 --> 23:58.895
But there is a line that I won't cross.

23:59.688 --> 24:04.985
I won't force you to do something
that would put you or your baby at risk.

24:05.944 --> 24:08.321
-What do you mean?
-You have a choice.

24:08.947 --> 24:12.284
You can back away right now
and our case against Soto goes away,

24:12.367 --> 24:16.288
and you two can raise your child together,
and you'll never hear from me again.

24:17.372 --> 24:19.499
I don't want to raise my child with him.

24:20.208 --> 24:22.085
Then you can make a different choice.

24:23.336 --> 24:27.132
You can wear a wire, a hidden microphone,

24:27.215 --> 24:31.094
and you can get Angelo to confess
to ordering the murder of David Loresca.

24:33.763 --> 24:35.474
I promise, we'll be right outside.

24:37.934 --> 24:38.977
How old were you?

24:39.936 --> 24:42.022
-When?
-When he brought you here.

24:42.731 --> 24:45.942
Made you work for table scraps
until he took a liking to you. How old?

24:48.862 --> 24:49.905
Nineteen.

24:51.990 --> 24:53.033
Nineteen.

24:55.619 --> 24:58.121
Well, if you wanna escape
from him once and for all, Tanya,

24:58.205 --> 24:59.414
this is your chance.

25:02.751 --> 25:03.835
But it's up to you.

25:07.797 --> 25:09.674
Closing is about to start. Where are you?

25:09.758 --> 25:11.927
I'm right in the middle
of something, babe.

25:12.761 --> 25:14.888
-<i>For the Elliott case?</i>
-Kinda.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.141
<i>I'll be there as soon as I can.</i>

25:22.437 --> 25:23.688
You weren't lying.

25:25.690 --> 25:26.900
Excuse me?

25:27.484 --> 25:29.903
When you said you were
gonna be at the trial till the end.

25:31.988 --> 25:33.698
It's the least I could do for Jan.

25:34.866 --> 25:39.412
Carol, I'm so sorry for your loss.
I should have told you that the first day.

25:40.288 --> 25:44.334
Whatever happens,
I hope this brings you some peace.

25:53.885 --> 25:55.220
Mr. Golantz?

26:17.033 --> 26:18.118
Ladies and gentlemen.

26:19.828 --> 26:21.162
This case is simple.

26:22.956 --> 26:26.710
A man discovers that his wife is having
an affair and they have an argument.

26:27.502 --> 26:28.753
This is not disputed.

26:30.088 --> 26:32.340
Next morning,
he drives to their beach house,

26:32.424 --> 26:34.718
where the security cameras are turned off.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.304
Also not disputed.

26:37.387 --> 26:44.311
There, he claims he finds his wife
and her lover have been shot to death.

27:06.249 --> 27:10.253
Now, the defense
asks you to believe the absurd story

27:11.004 --> 27:13.048
that the defendant went to the house

27:13.673 --> 27:16.176
to surprise his wife
with a trip up the coast.

27:16.968 --> 27:19.512
That the gunshot residue
found on his hand,

27:19.596 --> 27:21.348
that didn't come from firing a gun.

27:21.431 --> 27:23.975
No, that came from an unwashed police car.

27:26.186 --> 27:30.315
That it's just a coincidence
that the killer used the identical gun

27:30.398 --> 27:31.900
as the hero in his video game.

27:33.276 --> 27:37.072
And that he was the victim
of a rush to judgment,

27:37.155 --> 27:42.327
despite the fact that he admits to lying
to police to hide the appearance of guilt.

27:44.454 --> 27:46.831
But common sense and logic will tell you

27:46.915 --> 27:52.045
who fired the bullets that ended the lives
of Lara Elliott and Jan Rilz that day.

27:52.128 --> 27:55.632
Now, you heard the defendant
testify that he loved his wife.

27:55.715 --> 27:58.218
What does love mean
to a man like Trevor Elliott?

28:08.895 --> 28:12.649
He used Lara as the model
for his video game.

28:13.400 --> 28:15.568
Because that's what he wanted her to be.

28:15.652 --> 28:19.406
An empty shell
that he could control with a few buttons.

28:19.489 --> 28:23.743
He locked his wife in a gilded cage,
and when she tried to break free,

28:23.827 --> 28:26.454
he murdered her and her boyfriend.

28:26.538 --> 28:31.209
Because if Trevor Elliott couldn't
have Lara, neither could anyone else!

28:35.338 --> 28:39.509
Simply put, Trevor Elliott is guilty.

28:39.592 --> 28:44.931
If common sense and logic are your guide,
there is no other conclusion.

28:48.518 --> 28:49.394
Thank you.

29:00.572 --> 29:01.781
Mr. Haller?

29:06.703 --> 29:08.747
How much
do closing statements really matter?

29:08.830 --> 29:10.790
Hasn't the jury
already made up their mind?

29:10.874 --> 29:12.834
Remember, it's not a speech,
it's an argument.

29:12.917 --> 29:15.628
If you don't listen
to what the prosecutor is saying,

29:15.712 --> 29:18.256
you'll miss your chance
to take the weakest part of your case

29:18.339 --> 29:20.133
and turn it into your greatest strength.

29:41.070 --> 29:45.533
My daughter is taking algebra,
and she hates it.

29:45.617 --> 29:46.451
She hates it.

29:46.534 --> 29:48.995
She says, "Dad, why do I need this?"

29:49.078 --> 29:53.500
I say, "Honey, when the ancient Mayans
wanted to understand their world,

29:53.583 --> 29:54.667
they developed math."

29:55.293 --> 29:59.172
"They discovered the calendar,
365 days in a solar year."

29:59.255 --> 30:00.173
"Amazing, right?"

30:00.256 --> 30:02.926
-Didn't work. She still hates it.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.720
Anyway, why am I telling you this?

30:06.429 --> 30:09.098
Because we're gonna use math
to understand our world.

30:09.182 --> 30:14.771
Now, bear with me. Mr. Elliott's car
leaves his office at 10:44 a.m.

30:16.314 --> 30:20.068
At an average speed
of 35 miles per hour, right?

30:20.151 --> 30:25.824
So he arrives at his house
in Malibu, which is 21.2 miles away

30:26.658 --> 30:28.785
in 36 minutes.

30:28.868 --> 30:30.161
That is undisputed.

30:31.663 --> 30:32.664
So, he arrives…

30:34.833 --> 30:39.170
at 11:20 a.m.
and calls 911 five minutes later

30:40.505 --> 30:43.007
at 11:25 a.m.

30:44.717 --> 30:48.596
Now, this call triggers
the arrival of the videographer,

30:48.680 --> 30:52.141
who begins filming Trevor Elliott
outside of his house

30:52.225 --> 30:58.815
at exactly 11:27 a.m.
That leaves just seven minutes.

31:01.317 --> 31:04.028
Seven minutes
from when Mr. Elliott arrived

31:04.112 --> 31:07.657
until the videographer
began filming him outside of his house.

31:07.740 --> 31:12.662
Seven minutes for him to commit
these crimes and cover them up.

31:14.414 --> 31:17.000
Now, the victims were shot
at point-blank range.

31:17.834 --> 31:21.254
There was no blood
on Mr. Elliott's clothes or hands.

31:22.255 --> 31:26.885
That means he would have had to clean up
and change before the deputies arrived.

31:28.261 --> 31:30.221
And that brings us to the gun.

31:30.305 --> 31:34.183
Now, Mr. Golantz
says that this, this cartoon weapon

31:34.267 --> 31:37.645
is somehow proof that Mr. Elliott
must have owned a gun like this.

31:39.063 --> 31:40.940
But if that's true, then where is it?

31:41.024 --> 31:44.611
Where is the real gun
that killed Lara Elliott and Jan Rilz?

31:45.486 --> 31:47.280
Where are the bloody clothes?

31:47.363 --> 31:49.365
Now, the beach house is on top of a hill.

31:49.449 --> 31:51.826
It's a ten-minute drive down to the PCH,

31:51.910 --> 31:56.664
and the police searched the entire area
with dogs and found nothing.

31:56.748 --> 32:00.960
Nothing. And Mr. Golantz wants you
to believe that in seven minutes,

32:01.044 --> 32:06.049
seven minutes, Mr. Elliott shot his wife
and her lover, cleaned up,

32:06.132 --> 32:09.761
and disposed of the evidence
where the police could never find it.

32:09.844 --> 32:12.722
It's impossible.
And that is what math tells us.

32:13.723 --> 32:17.226
It tells us that Mr. Elliott didn't do it,

32:18.269 --> 32:23.024
and the real killer, whoever he was,
took the evidence with him.

32:23.733 --> 32:27.028
So, who else had a motive
to kill Jan Rilz and Lara Elliott?

32:27.987 --> 32:33.451
Who did Detective Kinder ignore
as a suspect until he was put under oath?

32:33.534 --> 32:37.956
Who do we know carries a gun because
he told us so when he was on the stand?

32:41.501 --> 32:42.627
Anton Shavar.

32:44.337 --> 32:47.423
A jealous husband,
who, unlike Trevor Elliott,

32:47.507 --> 32:49.634
has a long history of violence.

32:51.594 --> 32:55.223
Now, Mr. Golantz asked you
to use common sense and logic,

32:55.306 --> 32:56.641
and I couldn't agree more.

32:58.768 --> 33:03.231
But don't let yourself be manipulated
by cheap, emotional tricks.

33:03.314 --> 33:05.566
With common sense and logic as your guide,

33:05.650 --> 33:11.030
you will find that Mr. Elliott could not
possibly have committed these crimes.

33:12.490 --> 33:17.537
And I am confident that you
will return a verdict of not guilty.

33:22.500 --> 33:23.459
Thank you.

33:40.601 --> 33:43.604
-I talked to Tanya.
-<i>And?</i>

33:43.688 --> 33:45.106
And I don't like it, Maggie.

33:45.982 --> 33:47.108
But it's up to her.

33:48.026 --> 33:50.737
And listen, Mags,
the second you see any trouble,

33:50.820 --> 33:52.739
you get her out of there. All right?

33:52.822 --> 33:55.158
I promise. And Mickey, thank you.

34:13.426 --> 34:17.722
Trevor's story
about Sergei Kosevich, it's bullshit.

34:17.805 --> 34:20.933
-Based on what?
-Corporate records of Trevor's company.

34:21.642 --> 34:25.605
Turns out the investors are legit.
Usual venture capital crowd.

34:25.688 --> 34:29.025
Well, that's because
Kosevich is a silent partner.

34:29.776 --> 34:31.944
Trevor would never admit
he was funded by a thug.

34:32.028 --> 34:35.490
I thought so, too.
So I went straight to the source.

34:35.573 --> 34:37.658
Kosevich's son, Pavel.

34:37.742 --> 34:42.121
-That's Trevor's roommate at Stanford.
-Took me a while to reach him.

34:42.205 --> 34:45.124
And the minute I mentioned Trevor,
the guy hung up on me.

34:45.208 --> 34:47.627
-Which proves nothing.
-Yes, and no.

34:47.710 --> 34:50.213
Turns out there was
a third roommate at Stanford.

34:50.296 --> 34:54.801
Ben Hoffman.
He's the CTO of Pavel's company.

34:55.593 --> 34:57.428
Him, I got through to.

34:58.054 --> 35:00.890
He says Pavel hated Trevor's guts,

35:00.973 --> 35:04.352
and that his dad was never
gonna finance anything of Trevor's.

35:04.435 --> 35:07.230
-Still, it doesn't prove anything.
-Maybe not.

35:08.731 --> 35:13.778
But Trevor took the stand
when the case was already won.

35:13.861 --> 35:15.988
Now, would he actually do that

35:16.072 --> 35:19.909
if he had a Russian mobster
holding a gun to his head?

35:24.372 --> 35:26.082
You don't let anything go, do you?

35:26.165 --> 35:29.544
Yeah, well, you didn't hire me
just to tell you what you wanna hear.

35:30.294 --> 35:36.175
The question is, if it's not the Russians,
then who the fuck has been following you?

35:43.808 --> 35:45.476
Mickey Haller.

35:45.560 --> 35:47.395
Yes, I'll be right there. Thank you.

35:50.064 --> 35:51.023
Jury's back.

35:56.946 --> 35:59.907
-Has the jury reached a verdict?
-We have, Your Honor.

36:24.807 --> 36:26.559
The defendant will stand.

36:33.399 --> 36:34.650
You may read the verdict.

36:37.904 --> 36:40.698
"In the matter of the
<i>State of California vs. Trevor Elliott,</i>

36:40.781 --> 36:43.701
on the charge
of first-degree murder of Jan Rilz,

36:43.784 --> 36:46.579
we find the defendant not guilty."

36:49.373 --> 36:50.374
No.

36:53.920 --> 36:57.256
"On the charge
of first-degree murder of Lara Elliott,

36:57.340 --> 36:59.300
we find the defendant not guilty."

37:07.183 --> 37:09.101
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

37:09.185 --> 37:12.396
I want to thank you
for your service and deliberation.

37:12.480 --> 37:14.649
Mr. Elliott, you're free to go.

38:07.159 --> 38:10.871
We have champagne and
sparkling grape juice for you and Izzy.

38:10.955 --> 38:14.500
<i>You guys celebrate.</i>
<i>I've got somewhere I have to go.</i>

38:14.583 --> 38:17.545
Mick? Are you sure you're okay?

38:18.379 --> 38:19.380
I will be.

38:27.722 --> 38:28.723
What is this?

38:30.599 --> 38:32.518
I already signed my plea deal.

38:33.394 --> 38:37.315
It's an affidavit, signed by me.

38:39.400 --> 38:40.609
You were right, Eli.

38:41.777 --> 38:43.154
Jerry dumped you here

38:44.071 --> 38:45.197
and did it to hide evidence

38:45.281 --> 38:47.908
from the prosecution
on the Trevor Elliott case.

38:49.118 --> 38:51.954
You were collateral damage.

38:53.247 --> 38:54.874
And why are you doing this?

38:59.879 --> 39:04.175
Well, because you lost
six months of your life here,

39:04.258 --> 39:06.635
so Jerry could--

39:07.595 --> 39:11.098
So I could win a case, and it's not right.

39:13.059 --> 39:15.269
This is going to give me
my six months back?

39:15.353 --> 39:18.814
No, but you can use it
to sue Jerry Vincent's estate.

39:19.732 --> 39:21.484
He had malpractice insurance.

39:22.234 --> 39:25.780
That money can help you get back
on your feet once you're out of prison.

39:27.073 --> 39:29.950
And here I thought
all you lawyers stuck together.

39:30.034 --> 39:32.620
There's a lot of things
I would do to win a case.

39:32.703 --> 39:38.876
I will walk right up to the line,
but I won't sell out a client, ever.

39:47.051 --> 39:48.844
Look who's on the TV news.

39:49.762 --> 39:53.015
<i>I do wanna say something to the LAPD.</i>

39:54.392 --> 39:58.062
<i>Do your job. Lara's killer's out there.</i>

39:58.145 --> 40:00.815
<i>I'm not gonna rest</i>
<i>until they're brought to justice.</i>

40:00.898 --> 40:02.983
Kinda worked out
for you though, didn't it?

40:03.776 --> 40:05.444
Jerry did all the dirty work.

40:05.528 --> 40:07.446
<i>Lara was the love of my life…</i>

40:08.489 --> 40:09.990
You got all the glory.

40:11.158 --> 40:13.744
<i>And I will continue</i>
<i>to work tirelessly</i>

40:13.828 --> 40:16.414
<i>to celebrate her memory. Thank you.</i>

40:20.084 --> 40:23.295
Cisco, you know those records
you found on Parallax?

40:23.379 --> 40:25.464
I need you to find something else for me.

40:46.986 --> 40:49.071
Tanya.

40:49.155 --> 40:51.198
Where were you? I called you!

40:52.032 --> 40:53.701
Shopping for the baby.

40:53.784 --> 40:55.578
My phone died.

40:56.370 --> 40:58.164
What happened?

41:04.378 --> 41:06.297
I thought they got to you too.

41:07.840 --> 41:09.133
Who?

41:10.217 --> 41:12.928
The police. They wanna ruin me.

41:13.012 --> 41:15.473
<i>What are you talking about?</i>
<i>Angelo, you're scaring me.</i>

41:15.556 --> 41:16.724
Shit.

41:16.807 --> 41:19.101
-What?
-It's just a weak signal.

41:19.852 --> 41:20.811
Can we move?

41:21.479 --> 41:23.731
Fuckin' densest neighborhood in LA.

41:23.814 --> 41:27.610
I'm sorry, I'm just upset.
Someone has been talking to the police.

41:27.693 --> 41:30.237
They questioned an employee,
he told me what they said.

41:30.321 --> 41:35.034
But couldn't he be the one lying to you?

41:39.538 --> 41:43.083
I'm surrounded by snakes!

41:44.877 --> 41:48.464
Angelo, it's okay.
It's okay. Come here.

41:50.674 --> 41:52.801
<i>Don't believe anything</i>
<i>you hear about me.</i>

41:52.885 --> 41:53.761
Anything?

41:53.844 --> 41:55.262
-<i>I'm a good person.</i>
-Yeah.

41:55.346 --> 41:57.848
<i>All I've done</i>
<i>is give people better lives.</i>

41:57.932 --> 41:59.058
She's got him talking.

42:02.311 --> 42:03.771
How is my life better?

42:06.565 --> 42:07.566
What do you mean?

42:07.650 --> 42:08.984
-Oh, shit.
-What?

42:09.068 --> 42:11.654
<i>-I've given you everything.</i>
-Girl's improvising.

42:12.988 --> 42:15.324
<i>Everything I do</i>
<i>is for us, our family.</i>

42:17.785 --> 42:21.497
People think you killed that man. Did you?

42:21.580 --> 42:23.207
-Don't ask me that.
-I need to know.

42:24.416 --> 42:26.710
I can handle anything as long as I know.

42:26.794 --> 42:28.420
-I did what I had to--
-Did you?

42:28.504 --> 42:30.756
Yes, I did it, Tanya!
I did it to protect us!

42:30.839 --> 42:33.425
To protect our baby! Now, enough!

42:36.011 --> 42:40.307
It's okay, it's okay. You did it for us.

42:45.145 --> 42:46.480
No. No.

42:48.274 --> 42:50.150
The police said someone betrayed me.

42:52.653 --> 42:56.156
-What if it's you?
-Why would I talk to the police?

42:56.240 --> 42:57.741
I don't know anything.

42:59.201 --> 43:00.661
You do now.

43:12.089 --> 43:13.632
Angelo, please.

43:17.428 --> 43:22.725
Have you done this before?
Or do you need to pay someone to do it?

43:36.614 --> 43:37.656
LAPD!

43:37.740 --> 43:39.825
Hands where we can see 'em.

43:39.908 --> 43:42.077
Angelo Soto,
you're under arrest.

43:42.161 --> 43:45.998
Turn around, get on the fucking ground,
and put your hands behind your head.

43:54.006 --> 43:56.425
You'll never make any of this stick,
you know that, right?

43:56.508 --> 43:59.345
Watch me. You okay?

44:02.056 --> 44:03.015
You did great.

44:03.766 --> 44:06.518
Thank you. Okay. You're good.

44:09.480 --> 44:11.690
Mr. Haller,
I'm so glad you could make it.

44:11.774 --> 44:12.650
Trevor's at the bar.

44:15.611 --> 44:17.988
I think I've got his attention, thank you.

44:18.072 --> 44:20.908
There you are. I was talking to
the media outside the courthouse,

44:20.991 --> 44:24.453
-I blinked, and you're gone.
-I told you, I'm not a celebrity lawyer.

44:24.536 --> 44:27.915
Come on, don't be modest.
This win puts you in a whole new league.

44:27.998 --> 44:29.917
You mean those guys?

44:30.000 --> 44:32.461
I bet I could find
a potential client over there.

44:32.544 --> 44:35.172
I hope not.
Those are the ones acquiring my company.

44:35.255 --> 44:38.467
And I owe it all to you, Mickey. Cheers.

44:38.550 --> 44:41.720
It looks like we both got
what we wanted.

44:41.804 --> 44:43.681
Too bad Lara didn't.

44:45.432 --> 44:48.769
-What is it you think Lara wanted?
-For the truth to come out.

44:50.270 --> 44:55.150
Relax, Trevor. You don't just have
attorney-client privilege now,

44:55.234 --> 44:56.860
you've got double jeopardy too.

44:57.778 --> 45:00.531
No one will ever
know your secret, at least not from me.

45:02.324 --> 45:06.829
So the, uh, lawyer
that advertises on bus benches

45:06.912 --> 45:09.164
has come down here to put me in my place.

45:09.248 --> 45:12.376
You played me, Trevor. I don't get played.

45:12.459 --> 45:16.964
I was so caught up in getting back
to the top, I forgot the first rule.

45:17.047 --> 45:20.175
-Which is?
-Everybody lies.

45:22.553 --> 45:26.265
She did all the dirty work
and you got all the glory.

45:26.348 --> 45:29.351
I'm sorry, Mickey. I'm just not following.

45:29.435 --> 45:32.146
Sonia Patel said that
Lara was a brilliant coder.

45:33.063 --> 45:36.066
Yet she quit her job to follow you? Why?

45:36.859 --> 45:38.318
Because she loved me, Mickey.

45:38.402 --> 45:42.072
Because she's the one who did it. Not you.

45:42.156 --> 45:47.244
Those hundred lines of code that changed
everything. Lara wrote them. Didn't she?

45:47.327 --> 45:52.624
Except she was working for Chaos Games.
So whatever she created belonged to them.

45:52.708 --> 45:57.004
But if you created it instead of her,
then it belonged to you.

45:57.796 --> 46:00.799
She was the genius, not you.

46:00.883 --> 46:03.635
For ten years,
she had to watch you take all the credit.

46:06.430 --> 46:10.017
That's quite a story.
I just have one question,

46:10.100 --> 46:13.061
how much blow did you do
before you got here?

46:13.729 --> 46:15.147
Like I said, everybody lies.

46:16.148 --> 46:19.151
But even the best liars
give themselves away.

46:20.319 --> 46:24.114
I saw it on the stand.
When Golantz asked you about Sonia.

46:24.198 --> 46:27.785
<i>He rubs his legs.</i>
<i>It can be a sign of deception.</i>

46:28.744 --> 46:31.872
The fight wasn't about Lara
wanting a divorce,

46:31.955 --> 46:34.041
she was gonna tell Sonia the truth.

46:35.042 --> 46:39.713
She was gonna go back to Chaos Games,
take back what was rightfully hers.

46:39.797 --> 46:41.131
And if she did that,

46:42.841 --> 46:44.384
all this goes away.

46:46.804 --> 46:49.306
And everybody finds out you're a fraud.

46:51.266 --> 46:52.726
You know, couple weeks ago,

46:53.477 --> 46:57.439
you came down to my office
to beg me for a job.

46:58.190 --> 47:01.735
Yeah. And you told me
that my previous attorney was good,

47:01.819 --> 47:04.071
but that you were better.

47:04.154 --> 47:07.074
And you know what, Mickey?
You're absolutely right.

47:07.157 --> 47:11.537
You did a fantastic job defending me.
You asked all the key questions.

47:13.413 --> 47:16.834
Where is the gun?
Where are the bloody clothes?

47:16.917 --> 47:19.920
How could he have gotten rid
of all of that in--

47:20.003 --> 47:23.340
What was it? Seven minutes?

47:24.967 --> 47:29.346
Well, you showed me how you did that too.
I was just too blind to see it at first.

47:30.973 --> 47:34.852
<i>Your drone.</i>
<i>You know what the best part is?</i>

47:34.935 --> 47:37.729
I watched you do it. We all did.

47:38.480 --> 47:41.400
<i>You weren't checking your emails</i>
<i>when the cops arrived.</i>

47:41.483 --> 47:45.070
You were controlling the drone that was
carrying the gun and your clothes.

47:45.153 --> 47:47.197
You sent it out over the ocean

47:47.281 --> 47:49.575
till it sank
where no one would ever find it.

47:50.200 --> 47:52.411
I gotta hand it to you, that was clever.

47:53.287 --> 47:58.542
If you really believe all that is true,
you must think I'm a monster.

47:59.209 --> 48:03.380
I'll tell you exactly what you are,
Trevor. You're an addict.

48:03.463 --> 48:07.009
There must be some rush
to have people think you're a genius.

48:07.843 --> 48:09.678
You'd do anything to chase it.

48:09.761 --> 48:13.807
Even take the stand
when the case was already won.

48:16.894 --> 48:20.564
Hey, come on. How much do you want?

48:20.647 --> 48:22.733
That's what this is, right?
The shakedown.

48:22.816 --> 48:24.484
I don't want your fucking money.

48:24.568 --> 48:27.654
-No?
-I wanna know who's behind it.

48:27.738 --> 48:32.034
The bribe, killing Jerry,
having me followed. I mean, was it you?

48:32.117 --> 48:33.994
Because I don't like to be a pawn.

48:34.077 --> 48:39.374
We're all pawns sometimes, Mickey.
Jerry kept me out of the loop.

48:39.458 --> 48:42.544
Honestly, I have no idea who killed him.

48:42.628 --> 48:46.673
Frankly… I don't care.

48:51.261 --> 48:55.807
You know, I didn't understand why
Jerry left me his cases, and now I do.

48:57.935 --> 48:59.728
He thought we were the same.

48:59.811 --> 49:03.941
A lawyer who needed this so badly,
he'd go along with a bribed juror.

49:04.024 --> 49:06.401
You thought so too.
Until I threatened to quit.

49:06.485 --> 49:09.780
That's why you told me
that bullshit story about the Russians.

49:10.530 --> 49:11.782
I did my due diligence.

49:11.865 --> 49:14.952
I realized you were a man
who might need a little extra incentive.

49:15.911 --> 49:17.496
To believe you were innocent?

49:17.579 --> 49:20.832
You know, the secret
to a successful video game?

49:22.626 --> 49:26.505
You have to keep
the player engaged, you know?

49:26.588 --> 49:29.841
You have to curate their reality.

49:30.968 --> 49:33.220
And right now, all this…

49:35.722 --> 49:36.932
This is my reality.

49:39.768 --> 49:41.770
That's one thing you're good at, Trevor.

49:42.813 --> 49:44.189
Making it look real.

50:01.206 --> 50:03.875
I don't wanna hear
anything else about Trevor Elliott.

50:03.959 --> 50:08.880
Well, then you're in luck. Glory Days
is flying in tomorrow to see Raj.

50:08.964 --> 50:10.340
You want me to go meet her?

50:11.258 --> 50:14.511
Ah, no, just text me the details.
I'll handle it.

50:14.594 --> 50:18.473
-Good job, Cisco.
<i>-No biggie. And Mick?</i>

50:18.557 --> 50:20.892
-Yeah?
-Take the win.

50:21.935 --> 50:23.562
Hell of a thing you did today.

50:31.486 --> 50:34.489
-What is it, Cisco?
-<i>Is this Michael Haller?</i>

50:35.657 --> 50:36.825
Who's this?

50:38.076 --> 50:41.747
<i>This is officer Anthony Reyes,</i>
<i>LAPD, Valley traffic division.</i>

50:41.830 --> 50:42.914
How can I help you?

50:43.790 --> 50:47.461
<i>I don't know, sir, we pulled over</i>
<i>Izzy Letts at Griffith Park Overlook</i>

50:47.544 --> 50:48.795
<i>on suspicion of DUI.</i>

50:48.879 --> 50:51.548
<i>She gave me your card</i>
<i>and asked me to call her lawyer,</i>

50:51.631 --> 50:53.050
<i>then she kinda passed out.</i>

50:54.593 --> 50:59.014
<i>I was about to go off duty, but I'm gonna</i>
<i>have to impound her car, book her unless…</i>

50:59.097 --> 51:00.599
<i>If you can get here quickly.</i>

51:00.682 --> 51:04.061
Just give me 15 minutes,
I'm on my way, all right? Thank you.

51:40.514 --> 51:41.598
Izzy!

51:55.403 --> 51:57.447
You should have
just gone along with it.

51:58.073 --> 51:59.449
You and Vincent.
