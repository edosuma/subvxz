00:03.469 --> 00:05.040
- Who are you?
- Name's Cole.

00:05.239 --> 00:09.745
Your older brother, Dean, he and I go way back.
That was the night Dean murdered my father.

00:09.910 --> 00:11.651
We're talking heavyweight witchcraft.

00:11.812 --> 00:14.520
Not some New Age,
Wiccan water dowser, either.

00:14.681 --> 00:17.355
This is Old World black magic,
warts and all.

00:17.518 --> 00:20.727
I hate witches. They're always spewing
their bodily fluids everywhere.

00:20.888 --> 00:22.094
It's downright unsanitary.

00:22.256 --> 00:24.998
Castiel,
it's time we stop avoiding the obvious.

00:25.158 --> 00:27.078
Hannah, we can't afford to lose our way.

00:27.160 --> 00:28.537
This mission, it's everything.

00:28.695 --> 00:32.040
Emotions, feelings,
they're dangerous temptations.

01:07.134 --> 01:09.478
- Raul.
- You'd better think fast, Tiana...

01:09.636 --> 01:12.082
...because this looks bad.

01:13.974 --> 01:17.421
I'm so... I'll do anything, I'll come back.
I'll make it up to you.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.421
Just, please, don't hurt me.

01:20.113 --> 01:21.922
Now...

01:22.583 --> 01:26.895
...what kind of message would that send
the other girls, huh?

01:39.132 --> 01:41.612
Oh, Tiana, Tiana.

01:41.768 --> 01:44.408
I'd say I'm sorry to lose you...

01:45.505 --> 01:48.179
...but there's plenty more
where you came from.

02:08.628 --> 02:12.634
What, this? Cattle deaths a few towns
oven'? Uh, demon possibility or something?

02:12.799 --> 02:15.712
No. It says right there
it's probably because of the drought.

02:15.869 --> 02:18.873
- So, what are we doing here?
- Uh, reason's right on your plate.

02:21.141 --> 02:24.554
Lazardo's Porterhouse, USDA prime. Only
place between Connecticut and the bunker...

02:25.879 --> 02:27.639
...you can get a decent steak
under 10 bucks.

02:27.781 --> 02:29.727
Dude, you are blowing up. Who is that?

02:29.883 --> 02:32.659
- It's just, uh, you know, these alert thingies.
- For what?

02:33.687 --> 02:35.189
You know, monster stuff.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.834
Hey, hey. Uh-uh. No, give it back.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.131
What? Why?

02:41.294 --> 02:43.900
- Because privacy and stuff.
- Oh, priv...

02:47.401 --> 02:48.505
You're on a dating app?

02:50.671 --> 02:53.481
Yeah. And you know what?
Don't knock it until you try it.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.483
Nice screen name, Dean.

02:55.642 --> 02:58.589
- "Impala67."
- All right, give it back. Come on.

02:58.745 --> 02:59.917
"Shaylene," huh?

03:01.248 --> 03:03.854
Dean, there are like a
million messages here.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.519
Yeah. Check out her pic.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.098
Uh... Oh. Wow.

03:08.488 --> 03:10.593
Okay, um... Okay, she's hot.

03:11.091 --> 03:13.230
- But...
- But what?

03:13.427 --> 03:15.600
But she seems, um...

03:16.530 --> 03:18.669
...kind of available.

03:18.832 --> 03:21.210
Like, too available.

03:21.368 --> 03:25.874
"Oh, baby, whatever you want.
I'm burning up just thinking about you."

03:26.039 --> 03:27.074
They get raunchier.

03:27.240 --> 03:30.187
Yeah. Yeah, I see that.
It's like a Penthouse letter.

03:30.343 --> 03:31.583
Yeah.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.247
Is that bad?

03:33.447 --> 03:35.757
No, it's not bad, Dean.
It's too good to be true.

03:36.850 --> 03:41.094
I'm sorry, is it so hard to believe that an
attractive, red-blooded American female...

03:41.254 --> 03:43.291
...could be interested in someone like me?

03:43.457 --> 03:48.964
You realize there's no guarantee
"Shaylene" is even Shaylene?

03:49.129 --> 03:55.978
I mean, for all you know, it could be
some Canadian trucker named Bruce.

04:03.910 --> 04:06.220
That look like a Bruce to you?

04:06.780 --> 04:09.727
We detoured eight hours
so you could get laid?

04:09.883 --> 04:15.094
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, and, uh, you know what?
Lunch is on me...

04:16.156 --> 04:18.158
...and, uh, don't wait up.

04:22.129 --> 04:25.599
- Excuse me. Hi.
- Hey.

04:33.607 --> 04:37.817
it's getting easier. Isaac came
back willingly. Didn't even resist.

04:38.011 --> 04:42.357
There are still some angels down here,
but the higher profile rogues are back.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.757
We find them all, that's the mission.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.926
Here. Christopher Sherman, pastor.

04:49.089 --> 04:52.434
Local paper in Tennessee says
he's working miracles in his parish.

04:52.592 --> 04:54.538
Figure of speech?

04:55.295 --> 04:56.535
Perhaps.

04:58.098 --> 05:00.942
But it's the best lead we have.

05:02.135 --> 05:05.548
Until we find something stronger,
we should...

05:12.145 --> 05:14.056
...uh, check it out.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.618
Hannah.

05:17.551 --> 05:19.292
Yes?

05:20.654 --> 05:22.065
What are you doing?

05:22.222 --> 05:24.702
I'm taking a shower.

05:27.727 --> 05:29.400
We don't need to shower.

05:30.363 --> 05:32.001
I know.

05:34.701 --> 05:35.907
Are youâ€œ?

05:38.238 --> 05:39.410
Does this bother you?

05:40.907 --> 05:43.183
Bothered? I...

05:44.144 --> 05:45.987
I'm not.

05:49.015 --> 05:50.858
Good.

06:04.431 --> 06:05.535
I forgot something.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.441
- What?
- We still need to discuss my terms.

06:09.236 --> 06:12.376
Oh, like rules? Like sexy rules?

06:12.539 --> 06:14.849
Um, more an issue of payment.

06:16.243 --> 06:17.278
Yeah, heh.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.885
Sweetie, I thought you figured it out.

06:21.047 --> 06:24.790
I mean, shy of coming out and saying it,
I thought I made it pretty obvious.

06:25.218 --> 06:28.256
Yeah, yeah. No, I just, um...

06:29.055 --> 06:32.059
See, I have this code.

06:32.359 --> 06:34.737
Uh, no cash for ass.

06:35.362 --> 06:38.434
Well, you're in luck, honey,
because I don't want your money.

06:38.632 --> 06:43.411
All I want from you is one little thing.
A trifle, really.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.473
I'm listening.

06:45.639 --> 06:47.243
Your soul.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.749
My soul.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.485
It's nothing, baby.

06:53.647 --> 06:56.924
Who knows what a soul is, really?
If it even exists.

06:57.083 --> 07:01.463
All I know is you say yes,
my guy comes up, you sign some papers...

07:01.655 --> 07:04.898
...and then it's you and me, good to go.

07:07.594 --> 07:08.766
So that's it?

07:08.929 --> 07:11.466
Jut sign over my life.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.975
It's a signature, baby.

07:14.167 --> 07:19.310
What's a little paperwork
compared to absolute physical bliss?

07:21.574 --> 07:25.021
- You make a strong case.
- I love my job.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.790
Do you?

07:30.750 --> 07:32.354
Yeah.

07:33.987 --> 07:36.365
Because it doesn't look like love to me.

07:43.830 --> 07:47.107
Get the car. I'll check us out.

07:56.509 --> 07:58.511
Caroline.

08:01.448 --> 08:04.019
I put an alert on your credit card.

08:04.718 --> 08:06.527
I saw a charge here.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.358
I drove all night.

08:12.892 --> 08:13.962
How we doing?

08:15.528 --> 08:18.031
Everybody ready for a good time?

08:18.465 --> 08:21.639
Okay. John Hancock, right here.

08:21.801 --> 08:23.576
Then we can get this party started.

08:30.377 --> 08:31.651
Winchesters.

08:37.317 --> 08:41.595
- She told us everything.
- Abduction, forced prostitution.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.597
That's pretty gnarly, even for a demon.

08:43.756 --> 08:46.397
- She's got her version, I've got mine.
- Liar.

08:46.559 --> 08:49.403
Let me guess. She came to you
begging for you to pimp her out.

08:49.562 --> 08:52.509
Yeah. Because that Harvard degree
was working so well for her.

08:52.665 --> 08:54.406
How many girls, hmm? How big is this?

08:54.567 --> 08:56.877
- Just me and Shay.
- He's lying.

08:57.037 --> 09:01.543
There's a brothel. I heard him on the phone.
They told me what you are. A demon from hell.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.119
Beats trash from the street.

09:04.344 --> 09:07.917
Face it. Without me, you would've been
dead of drugs, or worse, in a year.

09:09.449 --> 09:12.589
- Frankly, this little ho should
be thanking me-DEAN: Whoa!

09:23.630 --> 09:25.769
Okay. Well, that just happened.

09:25.932 --> 09:28.879
Yeah, and he was our best shot
at the location of the brothel.

09:29.035 --> 09:31.538
- Do you have any idea where it is?
- No.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.241
But, um...

09:40.113 --> 09:42.115
I saw him give these out at the bars.

09:48.721 --> 09:49.825
What did you say?

09:49.989 --> 09:53.630
I said, if you like it so much,
why don't you wear it?

09:56.663 --> 09:58.609
She won't wear the clothes you picked.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.438
What should I do?

10:00.834 --> 10:04.145
Gerald, what do you think?

10:05.738 --> 10:07.740
Don't leave any marks.

10:11.978 --> 10:13.184
Hey, lady...

10:13.346 --> 10:15.257
...I think you're in the wrong place.

10:15.415 --> 10:18.658
This is Raul's Girls, isn't it?

10:20.253 --> 10:22.699
Clever name, by the way.

10:22.856 --> 10:25.268
Sorry, but were not hiring at the moment.

10:25.425 --> 10:27.200
And no offense...

10:27.360 --> 10:30.000
...but even if we were,
you're a little old.

10:31.664 --> 10:35.373
- Unless you're here as a customer.
- No disrespect to your girls...

10:35.869 --> 10:40.841
...but I'd sooner die
than do business of any kind...

10:41.007 --> 10:42.953
...with filth like you.

10:47.113 --> 10:48.820
You.

10:50.884 --> 10:51.885
Boss?

10:56.389 --> 10:59.802
Ladies, you may want to stand back.
This will get messy.

11:17.410 --> 11:20.516
Hardly the most appetizing process
in the world...

11:20.680 --> 11:24.184
...but killing demons
always makes me hungry.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.024
You coming?

11:31.191 --> 11:34.070
I mean, you're welcome to stay here.

11:38.431 --> 11:40.502
Fabulous.

11:45.772 --> 11:49.618
Caroline, you've been gone a year.

11:49.776 --> 11:50.846
Disappeared.

11:51.377 --> 11:55.553
I don't know what's happened to you,
I don't know who's gotten into your head...

11:55.715 --> 11:59.686
...but somethings going on
and I'm not walking away till I know what.

12:00.687 --> 12:03.634
Well, there's is a reason.
An answer for all of this.

12:03.790 --> 12:05.792
- Then tell me.
- I can't.

12:06.526 --> 12:08.870
You wouldn't understand.

12:10.096 --> 12:13.236
Then I'm not going anywhere.

12:15.802 --> 12:18.715
- I waited at the car but the
deskman said... - Castiel.

12:20.406 --> 12:21.544
This is Joe.

12:24.143 --> 12:26.646
- My husband.
- Oh?

12:29.782 --> 12:30.783
Oh.

12:33.152 --> 12:34.961
Who is this guy?

12:35.121 --> 12:36.998
He... I...

12:37.156 --> 12:39.762
You saying you're together?

12:40.493 --> 12:41.995
What?

12:45.598 --> 12:47.339
Yes.

12:49.168 --> 12:52.012
I left you for him.

12:54.741 --> 12:56.186
He's the reason.

12:57.443 --> 12:58.945
No.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.023
No, I don't believe it.

13:01.581 --> 13:04.289
This guy? You?

13:04.450 --> 13:06.259
There's something.

13:06.419 --> 13:08.023
You're not that kind of person.

13:08.187 --> 13:11.600
You wouldn't do that. You couldn't do that.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.286
I'm sorry.

13:31.044 --> 13:32.887
Let's go.

13:55.168 --> 13:58.843
I can't believe somebody got to kill
this Raul tool before we could.

13:59.138 --> 14:01.880
- Check IDs.
- All right.

14:08.581 --> 14:09.582
Uh, Dean?

14:10.416 --> 14:14.728
From the look and smell of it...

14:14.887 --> 14:16.423
...pure demon.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.364
I think this is Raul.

14:18.524 --> 14:22.438
- What, did he puke himself to death?
- Yeah, literally.

14:22.595 --> 14:24.097
Okay, so.

14:25.498 --> 14:28.001
Something went down here.
There was a standoff.

14:28.167 --> 14:30.443
One demon smokes out, and Raul...

14:31.537 --> 14:33.744
What can even kill a demon like this?

14:36.776 --> 14:38.517
Apparently...

14:39.545 --> 14:41.286
...a witch.

14:59.632 --> 15:02.408
Um, ma'am, why are we here?

15:02.568 --> 15:07.039
Well, I thought you'd be hungry.
I doubt that swine Raul fed you properly.

15:09.976 --> 15:11.956
Yeah, but...

15:12.545 --> 15:14.081
...we don't belong here.

15:17.717 --> 15:21.255
- Apologies for the interruption, ma'am.
- That word again.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.834
But I'm afraid that the Bistro ales Meules
has a very strict dress code.

15:24.991 --> 15:29.667
A sartorial standard certain members
of your party fall well short of.

15:32.598 --> 15:35.807
- Now can we go?
- Stay in your seats. We're not going anywhere.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.407
Excuse me?

15:38.237 --> 15:40.444
You heard me.

16:09.869 --> 16:14.318
A Krug '95. An excellent vintage.

16:15.208 --> 16:17.711
With our compliments, of course.

16:21.214 --> 16:23.057
This is awesome.

16:24.851 --> 16:26.228
How did you do it?

16:26.652 --> 16:28.359
Magic.

16:30.223 --> 16:32.134
Gerald...

16:35.394 --> 16:37.840
...a bordello?

16:38.631 --> 16:42.875
You opened a whorehouse in my name?

16:43.035 --> 16:45.709
Well. technically, the place
was called Raul's Girls...

16:45.872 --> 16:47.749
...but yes.

16:47.907 --> 16:52.151
- But Raul said that...
- Oh, Raul said.

16:52.578 --> 16:54.421
Your decree last month.

16:54.580 --> 16:57.857
Soul deals way down
after the war with Abaddon.

16:58.017 --> 17:01.863
Said you were looking for proactive
strategies to get numbers back up.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.830
So you and your halfwit pal
threw me into the sex trade?

17:05.657 --> 17:07.762
I'm evil, but that's just tacky.

17:07.926 --> 17:09.599
We tried running it past you.

17:09.762 --> 17:12.867
We were told you weren't taking meetings,
that you were distracted.

17:14.267 --> 17:15.940
I mean, busy.

17:16.602 --> 17:19.845
Look, this witch took Raul down like that:

17:20.006 --> 17:22.849
The whole operation, kaput. I smoked out.

17:23.009 --> 17:24.214
Ran away.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.790
- Possessed the nearest meat suit I could find.
- Apparently so.

17:28.948 --> 17:31.895
Because I thought that you should know
what happened.

17:32.184 --> 17:34.357
An act of aggression like that...

17:34.520 --> 17:37.296
...didn't seem like something
you could let stand.

17:41.427 --> 17:42.599
Hmm.

17:44.697 --> 17:46.040
Here we go.

17:46.198 --> 17:51.477
So it looks like in the 18th century, there
were accounts of demons killed by witchcraft.

17:51.637 --> 17:57.588
Apparently, they were vanquished by a spell
called "Defigere Et Depurgare."

17:57.743 --> 18:03.056
Which is Latin for "to bind and purge."

18:03.215 --> 18:05.593
You think that's the same spell
that took out Raul?

18:05.751 --> 18:07.253
Sounds like it.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.263
But from what I can tell...

18:09.422 --> 18:11.959
...that spell hasn't been used
in over 300 years.

18:12.124 --> 18:15.333
And it was only ever known by one person.

18:15.494 --> 18:17.269
The witch who created it.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.841
That is...?

18:18.998 --> 18:20.568
"Rowena."

18:20.733 --> 18:25.910
According to the Grand Coven, there are three
recognized kinds of witch in the world.

18:26.072 --> 18:28.279
Most common are the Borrowers.

18:28.441 --> 18:32.355
Those who harness the power of a demon
in order to practice the art.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.750
Owing to recent experience...

18:35.481 --> 18:37.483
...I doubt you'd have the stomach for that.

18:38.651 --> 18:42.690
Secondly, and rarest of
all, are the Naturals.

18:42.855 --> 18:46.098
Those who are born with the gift.

18:46.258 --> 18:47.328
You're one of those.

18:47.493 --> 18:49.268
Well...

18:49.629 --> 18:52.007
...you are correct.

18:53.766 --> 18:56.269
- And what's the third?
- The Students.

18:56.435 --> 19:00.815
Those with no natural ability,
who, with enough practice and training...

19:00.973 --> 19:04.011
...and a Grand Coven-approved mentor
to show them the path...

19:04.176 --> 19:07.453
...can eke out a modicum of witchly power.

19:07.713 --> 19:10.523
- Will you be our mentor?
- Heh.

19:10.683 --> 19:15.723
Well, I'm about as far from Grand
Coven-approved as it's possible to be.

19:17.890 --> 19:19.665
They threw me out...

19:19.959 --> 19:21.165
...many years ago.

19:22.028 --> 19:27.740
Disapproved of my methods,
said my magic was too extreme.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.845
I was forbidden from using magic...

19:31.003 --> 19:34.712
...from taking students,
from forming a coven.

19:37.176 --> 19:41.420
I've been on the run
from those utter fannies ever since.

19:41.981 --> 19:44.154
So you can't teach us.

19:46.085 --> 19:51.057
Screw the Grand Coven
and their silly rules.

19:51.223 --> 19:54.864
You two stick with me
and you can have anything...

19:55.027 --> 19:57.940
...do anything you want,
whenever you want.

19:58.097 --> 19:59.269
When do we start?

20:04.503 --> 20:06.574
Soon, but not here.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.957
Whoops, I believe that's our cue.

20:23.956 --> 20:26.869
- Did you do that?
- Oh, he'll be fine.

20:27.226 --> 20:30.639
Worker's comp and all that. Are you coming?

20:33.966 --> 20:36.139
Call 911.

20:47.713 --> 20:49.590
I'm not afraid.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.990
Because you're a newb.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.431
Heh, I'm your first.

20:57.590 --> 21:01.561
That's why you're drawing this out,
because you're studying me.

21:01.727 --> 21:03.673
You're training.

21:07.133 --> 21:10.273
It's gonna take a lot more than that
to make me talk.

21:10.503 --> 21:12.483
Boy, you will talk.

21:12.638 --> 21:18.088
You will talk and you will tell me everything
you know about your buddy Dean Winchester.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.760
At some point,
we have to talk about what happened.

21:30.923 --> 21:32.800
The, uh...

21:34.160 --> 21:37.141
He wouldn't listen, Castiel.

21:37.363 --> 21:39.434
He wouldn't let me go.

21:41.967 --> 21:44.311
I didn't wanna hurt him.

21:44.770 --> 21:47.478
I could have erased his memories...

21:48.440 --> 21:49.714
...but it didn't feel right.

21:49.875 --> 21:55.484
I thought if he truly believed
we were together, he'd give up.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.389
And it worked.

21:59.218 --> 22:01.164
So why does it feel so bad?

22:01.554 --> 22:03.625
You did the right thing.

22:04.290 --> 22:06.133
You hurt him, but you gave him a reason.

22:06.292 --> 22:10.001
Something he could use to move forward
and make sense of his loss.

22:10.162 --> 22:13.541
I had to take my vessel from his family.

22:13.699 --> 22:15.838
Twice, actually.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.079
Jimmy Novak.

22:18.237 --> 22:20.649
He was a good man. He was married.

22:20.806 --> 22:22.649
Had a daughter.

22:23.142 --> 22:24.382
Claire.

22:24.977 --> 22:26.479
And...?

22:27.479 --> 22:30.221
And it was difficult, but necessary.

22:30.382 --> 22:33.261
The mission comes first. Always.

22:56.342 --> 23:00.256
Middle of my shift, there's Marty,
falling down, clutching his head...

23:00.412 --> 23:02.414
...stroking out right there on the floor.

23:02.581 --> 23:06.393
Sweating, turning red like...
Like... Like he was...

23:06.552 --> 23:09.294
Like his brains were boiling?

23:10.756 --> 23:12.258
Was there anything else unusual?

23:12.424 --> 23:15.405
More unusual than our head waiter
dropping dead in front of me?

23:15.694 --> 23:17.105
Before that.

23:17.596 --> 23:20.975
I don't know. I thought getting two hookers
in here was pretty unusual...

23:21.133 --> 23:23.113
...but that was before Marty keeled over.

23:23.269 --> 23:24.441
Two hookers?

23:24.603 --> 23:26.640
Based on what they were wearing, yeah.

23:26.805 --> 23:28.580
Were they alone?

23:28.774 --> 23:30.583
No. Came in with a lady.

23:33.145 --> 23:34.590
Thank you for your time.

23:36.482 --> 23:40.123
No, that is strange.
All right, I hear you. Thank you.

23:41.453 --> 23:42.454
Hey.

23:42.621 --> 23:45.295
So it looks like our witch was here
with two new friends.

23:45.457 --> 23:46.993
Really?

23:47.559 --> 23:50.597
- Raul's girls? What does she want with them?
- I don't know.

23:50.763 --> 23:54.108
- What'd you get from the Hunter network?
- Darrell's been working a case.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.745
Series of grisly hotel murders.

23:55.901 --> 23:59.007
One at the Kensington,
another at the Waldorf in Cleveland.

23:59.171 --> 24:01.310
Bodies stabbed, impaled on the ceiling.

24:01.473 --> 24:03.578
Sounds more homicidal maniac than witchy.

24:03.742 --> 24:06.655
That's what Darrell thought too
until the autopsy came back.

24:06.812 --> 24:09.486
- Actual cause of death...
- Let me guess. Boiled brains.

24:09.648 --> 24:10.820
Yeah. Same as our waiter.

24:10.983 --> 24:13.122
I'll give this to the witch,
she's got deep pockets.

24:13.285 --> 24:16.164
The Kensington, Waldorf, this restaurant.
That can't be cheap.

24:16.855 --> 24:17.993
Yeah.

24:18.157 --> 24:19.534
- Let's go.
- Where we going?

24:19.692 --> 24:22.673
- To check out every five-star hotel in the area.
- Oh.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.112
What's going on?

24:35.474 --> 24:37.818
I'm sorry, Castiel.

24:38.377 --> 24:40.721
I'm not going with you.

24:43.115 --> 24:44.856
I'm done.

24:52.992 --> 24:56.838
It's hard letting go...

24:57.629 --> 25:01.042
...of a story, a mission.

25:02.701 --> 25:07.707
But what of the humans whose lives
we sacrifice in the name of that mission?

25:07.873 --> 25:09.716
What of them?

25:10.843 --> 25:14.723
We always said the humans
were our original mission.

25:15.581 --> 25:18.585
Maybe it's time, Castiel.

25:18.751 --> 25:21.163
Time to put them first.

25:21.320 --> 25:22.924
Where is all this coming from?

25:23.088 --> 25:25.034
Being on Earth.

25:25.424 --> 25:26.869
Working with you.

25:27.259 --> 25:30.069
I've felt things, human things.

25:30.229 --> 25:33.506
Passions. Hungers.

25:35.834 --> 25:38.007
To shower...

25:38.170 --> 25:40.707
...feel water on my skin.

25:41.407 --> 25:43.444
To get closer to you.

25:47.546 --> 25:51.892
But all of that was nothing
compared to what I felt when I saw him.

25:52.084 --> 25:53.563
Her husband.

25:53.719 --> 25:56.632
His anger and his grief.

25:56.789 --> 26:01.067
And Caroline was inside me
screaming out for him...

26:01.260 --> 26:02.637
...for her life back.

26:04.296 --> 26:06.537
These feelings...

26:06.698 --> 26:09.474
...they aren't for me, for us.

26:09.802 --> 26:12.146
They belong to her.

26:15.140 --> 26:18.212
I know it's time to step aside.

26:26.752 --> 26:28.925
Goodbye, Castiel.

26:47.506 --> 26:49.144
Caroline.

26:49.308 --> 26:51.584
- I'm...
- Castiel.

26:53.078 --> 26:54.318
I know.

27:15.300 --> 27:17.541
Okay.

27:18.504 --> 27:21.542
You two ready for some practice?

27:22.374 --> 27:24.945
- Who is it?
- Probably the hotel manager.

27:25.110 --> 27:27.818
Probably here to complain
that I haven't paid the bill.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.516
You have those spells I gave you?

27:29.982 --> 27:33.452
Yeah, about that. I don't read Spanish.

27:34.119 --> 27:35.723
It's Latin.

27:35.888 --> 27:37.697
Phonetics are in the back, darling.

27:38.891 --> 27:40.131
"Phonetics"?

27:45.030 --> 27:46.065
Get ready.

27:47.399 --> 27:48.901
And on my word...

28:03.182 --> 28:06.220
You're in for a world of hurt
when we deliver you to our boss.

28:06.418 --> 28:08.921
What about us?
I'm not going back to that place.

28:09.087 --> 28:10.828
Operation Skank has been terminated.

28:10.989 --> 28:14.766
The only place you two are going
is the Dumpster out back.

28:36.848 --> 28:38.452
- Who are those guys?
- Hunters.

28:38.617 --> 28:41.097
- Let's get out of here.
- That's not an exit.

28:41.253 --> 28:45.531
Don't worry, ladies, our beefs not with
you. We're here for the witch. Rowena.

28:46.358 --> 28:47.962
Always nice to be recognized.

28:48.126 --> 28:50.197
Do something. A spell.

28:50.729 --> 28:53.642
That's an excellent idea.

29:00.806 --> 29:03.150
- What did you do to her?
- Heh-heh-heh.

29:15.921 --> 29:17.298
Go. Go.

29:21.760 --> 29:25.264
What'd you do? What did you do to her?

29:25.998 --> 29:29.844
Attack-dog spell. We needed a decoy.

29:30.002 --> 29:33.006
But... But she'll die.

29:33.171 --> 29:35.811
- Just like the waiter.
- Probably.

29:36.008 --> 29:40.616
Few humans are built to survive
magic like that, and Elle was weak.

29:42.748 --> 29:44.625
But you're not.

29:44.783 --> 29:48.595
I saw it the second we met.
You're strong.

29:50.422 --> 29:51.594
You're right.

29:53.125 --> 29:54.126
I am.

29:59.765 --> 30:01.767
Not another word.

30:10.175 --> 30:11.984
Lady, your luck has just run out.

30:15.314 --> 30:17.225
I'm pretty sure that's not true.

30:20.652 --> 30:23.565
Pal, we gotta work on your timing.

30:26.058 --> 30:28.299
Drop the gun, Dean-o.

30:28.860 --> 30:33.070
All right, she may not look like much,
but letting this one go, big mistake.

30:33.231 --> 30:35.142
Uh-huh.

30:36.068 --> 30:37.809
You heard the boy.

30:57.489 --> 31:01.335
Look, I am sorry about the last time we
met. Okay? I'm sorry about a lot of things.

31:03.261 --> 31:06.708
- I'm not the same person that I was.
- Oh, you're not a person at all.

31:06.865 --> 31:09.607
- You see, I know all about your kind now.
- My kind? Listen...

31:15.774 --> 31:18.015
I'm not a demon anymore.

31:22.614 --> 31:24.890
So were you a demon
when you murdered my father?

31:27.753 --> 31:29.460
No.

31:32.524 --> 31:33.798
Then you're still a monster.

31:47.139 --> 31:48.743
Let's go.

31:54.146 --> 31:56.456
Let me out.

31:56.915 --> 32:00.419
Look, whatever she did to you,
you have to fight it.

32:00.585 --> 32:03.293
I can't.

32:51.269 --> 32:52.270
Don't.

33:30.342 --> 33:31.753
What are you waiting for?

33:31.910 --> 33:33.548
Do it.

33:36.481 --> 33:37.482
No.

33:39.384 --> 33:41.864
I'm gonna clear this
mess up one and for all.

33:42.254 --> 33:45.258
You're gonna give me five minutes
and we're gonna talk. Get up.

33:51.696 --> 33:53.573
And after that...

33:54.366 --> 33:56.710
...if you don't like what you hear...

34:00.171 --> 34:02.549
...you still want me dead,
you take your shot.

34:10.215 --> 34:11.523
What I do...

34:12.449 --> 34:13.520
...is hunt monsters.

34:14.853 --> 34:17.025
Your dad, Cole, your dad was a monster.

34:17.188 --> 34:21.466
You say that now, but last time we fought,
you couldn't even remember his name.

34:21.626 --> 34:24.869
2003, Nyack, New York. Ed Trenton.

34:25.030 --> 34:29.409
I was working a case.
Three dead, livers ripped out and eaten...

34:29.568 --> 34:30.739
...by your father.

34:31.902 --> 34:35.783
- Livers?
- I'd tracked him down that night, to your house.

34:35.940 --> 34:38.319
You say he was a monster.
What kind of monster was he?

34:38.476 --> 34:39.920
I don't know.

34:40.478 --> 34:43.322
I'd never seen that kind before,
never seen it again.

34:43.748 --> 34:46.786
All I know is that he came home that night
looking to kill.

34:46.952 --> 34:49.431
Could've been you, could've been your mom.

34:49.588 --> 34:50.793
- No.
- That didn't happen...

34:50.956 --> 34:52.594
...because I was there to stop him.

34:52.757 --> 34:54.134
I heard his voice.

34:54.826 --> 34:56.998
It was a human voice
and he begged you to stop.

34:57.162 --> 34:58.835
It was a ploy.

34:59.097 --> 35:00.440
It's a monster's trick.

35:01.433 --> 35:03.140
I know what you heard.

35:03.335 --> 35:05.008
But know this...

35:05.670 --> 35:08.082
...that was not your father, Cole.

35:08.239 --> 35:09.616
Your father was already gone.

35:12.344 --> 35:15.120
Put it down. Sam, put it down.

35:15.280 --> 35:17.954
- Cole, it's fine.
- Dean?

35:18.984 --> 35:20.861
Put it down.

35:22.153 --> 35:24.599
Hey, right here. We're talking, okay?

35:27.125 --> 35:29.537
How can I believe you?

35:32.664 --> 35:34.268
How can I believe you?

35:40.038 --> 35:41.881
My whole life, I've been...

35:42.540 --> 35:44.281
I get it.

35:44.709 --> 35:46.814
That was your story.

35:47.646 --> 35:50.149
Look, man, I got one of those too.

35:51.116 --> 35:54.723
Okay, but those stories that we tell
that keep us going...

35:55.220 --> 35:59.134
...man, sometimes they blind us.
They take us to dark places.

35:59.290 --> 36:03.329
The kind of place where I might beat the crap
out of a good man just for the fun of it.

36:05.630 --> 36:08.042
The people who love me...

36:08.400 --> 36:10.573
...they pulled me back from that edge.

36:13.304 --> 36:15.545
Cole, once you touch that darkness...

36:16.207 --> 36:18.517
...it never goes away.

36:19.411 --> 36:21.516
Now, the truth is...

36:22.180 --> 36:23.989
...I'm past saving.

36:25.917 --> 36:27.863
I know how my story ends.

36:29.554 --> 36:32.433
It's at the edge of a blade
or the barrel of a gun.

36:34.559 --> 36:37.540
So the question is, is that gonna be today?

36:40.331 --> 36:42.572
That gonna be that gun?

36:45.236 --> 36:47.716
You've got a family, Cole.

36:51.342 --> 36:54.721
I heard you on the phone that night.

36:56.181 --> 36:58.684
I'm guessing they need you to come back.

36:59.517 --> 37:02.896
And they need you to come back whole.

38:04.482 --> 38:05.483
I'm...

38:06.451 --> 38:07.623
Hi.

38:08.520 --> 38:10.158
Hi.

39:17.989 --> 39:20.765
- He say where he was going?
- Home.

39:23.061 --> 39:24.540
Rowena?

39:25.263 --> 39:27.402
In the wind.

39:28.700 --> 39:31.840
What you said earlier back there...

39:32.036 --> 39:34.209
...about being past saving,
were you really...?

39:34.372 --> 39:36.682
I was just telling the guy
what he needed to hear.

39:42.113 --> 39:44.024
We'd better go.

40:04.736 --> 40:06.113
Winchesters showed up.

40:06.271 --> 40:10.651
Alpha Team went down,
but Beta Team was working contingency.

40:10.808 --> 40:13.414
Had a perimeter around the hotel.

40:13.912 --> 40:15.789
We got her.

40:16.447 --> 40:19.087
Right in there. Tortured.

40:19.250 --> 40:22.094
If you'd like, I could finish her off.

40:22.253 --> 40:25.132
Wipe that ridiculous smile off your face.

40:25.623 --> 40:27.125
What, do you want a medal?

40:27.292 --> 40:30.171
A thank you far cleaning up the mess
you made?

40:39.470 --> 40:43.111
Everyone working for me, touched.

40:43.508 --> 40:49.857
A bunch of needy, squalling,
incompetent infants.

40:55.954 --> 40:58.764
The king at last?

41:01.926 --> 41:06.272
King of what, Lilliput?
I mean, I'd heard you were short, but...

41:12.770 --> 41:14.181
Well?

41:14.339 --> 41:15.943
Get to it.

41:18.276 --> 41:21.155
Time for the coup de grace.

41:23.614 --> 41:25.958
Wee boy...

41:26.484 --> 41:29.328
...something the matter with you?

41:29.887 --> 41:32.697
Cat got your tongue, hmm?

41:33.191 --> 41:35.193
Meow.

41:41.566 --> 41:43.011
Mother?
