''From Arthur Kahn to Tom Sanders.

00:37.662 --> 00:40.392
''Product Name: Arcamax CD-ROM.

00:40.665 --> 00:44.328
''Considering the merger, I thought
you should get this at home:

00:44.502 --> 00:48.836
''Arcamax production lines running
at 29% despite all efforts.

00:49.174 --> 00:51.904
''Spot-checks on dada dada....

00:52.410 --> 00:55.902
''Speaking of the merger, are
you rich and famous yet?

00:56.081 --> 00:59.073
''Congratulations in
advance on your promotion.

00:59.351 --> 01:00.511
''Arthur.''

01:04.355 --> 01:06.586
Dad, you got E-mail.

01:07.859 --> 01:10.794
I'm not a pain in the ass,
I'm being a lawyer.

01:10.929 --> 01:12.590
There's a difference.

01:12.797 --> 01:16.858
No more computer games, Matt, it's time
for school. Eliza, where are you?

01:17.035 --> 01:18.866
You got E-mail.

01:19.037 --> 01:21.801
Tom, Matt's got toothpaste
all over himself!

01:23.875 --> 01:27.811
If you can't get them ready for
school, don't say you'll do it.

01:27.946 --> 01:29.038
You're welcome.

01:29.214 --> 01:30.442
I'm here.

01:30.615 --> 01:33.106
-And Liza needs a jacket.
-I know she needs a jacket!

01:33.318 --> 01:35.377
A jacket doesn't go, dad.

01:35.954 --> 01:37.182
Wear a sweatshirt.

01:37.422 --> 01:39.390
That's for girls, a white sweatshirt.

01:39.557 --> 01:40.888
Since when?

01:41.459 --> 01:43.393
Leave me alone.

01:47.832 --> 01:49.891
Put your jacket on.

01:50.068 --> 01:53.469
Ariel doesn't have a father.
She has two mothers.

01:53.638 --> 01:55.128
That's interesting.

01:55.340 --> 01:58.969
He's in a hotel with his secretary
patched in from New York...

01:59.144 --> 02:02.079
...while I'm brushing Cheerios
from my file folders.

02:02.247 --> 02:03.339
It's insanity.

02:03.481 --> 02:04.971
Put your jacket on.

02:05.150 --> 02:06.913
Put this on, sweetie.

02:07.085 --> 02:09.076
You can take it off at school.

02:09.253 --> 02:11.245
Listen to your mom.

02:11.423 --> 02:13.357
Matt, did you pee?

02:13.491 --> 02:17.928
I don't know why you said you'd
help me today, with your promotion.

02:18.096 --> 02:19.996
What's dad got around his neck?

02:20.165 --> 02:21.928
You don't know what this is?

02:22.267 --> 02:23.495
It's a tie.

02:23.668 --> 02:25.101
Dad's getting a promotion.

02:25.270 --> 02:27.101
-Dad, you got an E-mail.
-Thanks, honey. Let's go.

02:27.505 --> 02:28.597
We're late.

02:35.180 --> 02:37.444
Did you get the Disneyland tickets?

02:37.615 --> 02:39.606
With everything I have to do?

02:39.784 --> 02:41.615
It's just one call.

02:41.786 --> 02:42.878
Who are they for?

02:43.021 --> 02:46.286
Mohammed Jafar. He's foreman
of the Malaysian plant.

02:46.458 --> 02:49.894
You're the one person I know who
sucks up to the people below you.

02:51.963 --> 02:53.692
Matt, don't kick the seat.

02:53.898 --> 02:55.957
-What's on your tie?
-Toothpaste.

02:56.134 --> 02:59.194
-Let's go.
-Your tie shouldn't look like a bib.

03:23.995 --> 03:25.553
Hi, Cindy, what's up?

03:26.731 --> 03:29.063
Garvin came by the office this morning?

03:29.501 --> 03:30.934
About the promotion?

03:32.237 --> 03:34.068
Matt, will you stop that?

03:35.507 --> 03:38.499
He was surprised I was late?
What does that mean?

03:38.676 --> 03:41.941
Did he say it in passing,
or like he really meant it?

03:47.519 --> 03:50.750
I wonder why Garvin came by
the office at 8 in the morning?

03:50.955 --> 03:52.252
To congratulate you.

03:52.457 --> 03:54.755
He treats everyone like dirt--

03:54.959 --> 03:56.950
Except the top guys.

04:00.765 --> 04:02.596
Except the top guys.

04:03.601 --> 04:06.764
When this merger with
Conley-White goes through...

04:06.971 --> 04:09.201
...and they spin off our division...

04:09.374 --> 04:11.035
...we're going to be rich.

04:11.209 --> 04:12.608
We're already rich.

04:12.777 --> 04:14.039
No, I mean...

04:14.279 --> 04:15.871
...really rich.

04:16.481 --> 04:18.779
My grandmother used to say:

04:18.983 --> 04:22.544
''Don't climb up there too close
to God, He might shake the tree.''

04:34.732 --> 04:36.063
Tom!

04:36.634 --> 04:38.295
Thanks for this morning.

05:05.096 --> 05:07.030
Smaller, faster, cheaper, better.

05:08.032 --> 05:10.262
Remember
lugging the first ones around?

05:10.535 --> 05:14.164
People were amazed. It was like
showing a Polaroid to a bushman.

05:14.339 --> 05:17.433
Now, if it's bigger than a credit
card, it's too inconvenient.

05:17.609 --> 05:19.099
Keeps you on your toes.

05:19.277 --> 05:21.837
Eddie, it's Tom. Cindy said you called.

05:22.180 --> 05:23.545
Sure, I can hold.

05:24.849 --> 05:26.339
How's the job search?

05:27.352 --> 05:30.549
28 years at lBM. Did I
tell you what they told me?

05:30.688 --> 05:33.452
I was ''surplussed.''
Ever hear that word?

05:34.058 --> 05:36.185
What's going on down there?

05:36.794 --> 05:38.455
What? That's crazy.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.461
They should've said, ''sodomized.''

05:40.632 --> 05:45.467
They're not going to sell the
Austin plant. That's just a rumor.

05:45.637 --> 05:49.698
You don't see it coming. You go along,
and then one day there's no room.

05:49.874 --> 05:51.705
No more room for you.

05:52.210 --> 05:53.973
Smaller, faster, cheaper, better.

05:54.145 --> 05:58.878
I won't mention names. I'm just telling
you, it's not true. It's a rumor.

05:59.083 --> 06:01.711
I was making 150 a year. Big money.

06:03.221 --> 06:05.314
It's probably what you make, huh?

06:05.490 --> 06:06.821
Hang on.

06:06.991 --> 06:08.982
Why don't you call Cindy...

06:09.327 --> 06:12.091
...make an appointment.
I'll see if I can help.

06:12.997 --> 06:15.989
Eddie, they are not
going to sell Austin.

06:16.167 --> 06:19.102
If I'm telling you, who else
are you going to believe?

06:19.237 --> 06:19.896
Cindy.

06:20.405 --> 06:21.895
Pretty name.

06:22.240 --> 06:25.607
Used to have fun with the girls.
Nowadays they want your job.

07:06.484 --> 07:07.314
Good morning.

07:07.452 --> 07:10.216
-What did Garvin say? Should I see him?
-He didn't say.

07:10.722 --> 07:11.780
He growled.

07:11.956 --> 07:14.220
He was flirting. Did you get Arthur?

07:14.392 --> 07:16.223
He's standing by on the DVL.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.453
Lunch with Conley-White is at noon.

07:18.663 --> 07:22.292
We'll probably have those
sandwiches with the crusts cut off.

07:22.467 --> 07:24.958
Their jaws were wired shut
at the same prep school.

07:25.169 --> 07:26.966
The merger's still happening?

07:28.072 --> 07:29.061
You heard something?

07:29.574 --> 07:30.404
No.

07:30.575 --> 07:32.167
Just, I....

07:32.477 --> 07:33.967
What's on your tie?

07:34.912 --> 07:36.903
Garvin didn't mention my promotion?

07:37.081 --> 07:38.742
You said you'd be early today.

07:38.916 --> 07:41.316
People from ''Father of the Year''
didn't call?

07:41.753 --> 07:42.811
No.

07:43.254 --> 07:44.687
That's a joke.

07:47.191 --> 07:49.182
5 seconds to Malaysia.

07:49.761 --> 07:50.819
Should I close the door?

07:50.995 --> 07:52.087
Do I ever ask that?

07:52.430 --> 07:53.419
Never.

07:54.599 --> 07:55.998
Malaysian video linkup.

07:58.770 --> 08:00.761
You look good. Awake.

08:00.938 --> 08:02.337
What's wrong with Arcamax?

08:02.507 --> 08:07.001
The drives are very slow. We're
getting seek times in the 140-160 range.

08:07.211 --> 08:10.772
140 isn't a sexy CD player anymore.
Everyone has 140.

08:10.948 --> 08:13.439
My guys think there's a
compatibility problem...

08:13.618 --> 08:16.212
...between the controller chip
and the driver's software.

08:16.354 --> 08:18.288
That'll put us back a year.

08:18.456 --> 08:23.223
The screen flickers. The current cuts
in and out. It's a design problem.

08:23.361 --> 08:26.455
What do you mean?
All laptops have the same design.

08:26.631 --> 08:30.032
I sent you out some drives.
You should get them today.

08:30.234 --> 08:33.294
This is bad, Arthur.
How could this happen?

08:33.471 --> 08:35.631
Going to bury it until the merger?

08:35.807 --> 08:38.799
Don't you say anything.
Does anyone else know?

08:38.976 --> 08:41.967
I'm a grave. What,
are you kidding, Tom?

08:42.145 --> 08:46.139
I still think, really, that
Arcamax will be a major, major hit.

08:46.317 --> 08:48.751
I'll call you when I see the drives.

08:48.886 --> 08:50.547
Did you get the macadamia nuts?

08:50.755 --> 08:52.154
Good night, Arthur.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.151
They are so good.

08:54.325 --> 08:56.759
He's off the phone. I got to go.

08:58.996 --> 09:00.827
Do you know a Meredith Johnson?

09:00.998 --> 09:03.660
-Yes, years ago.
-She wanted to see you.

09:03.835 --> 09:05.166
She's here for the lunch.

09:05.336 --> 09:07.566
The entire company came for this lunch?

09:07.772 --> 09:10.070
Garvin brought up the Operations Group.

09:10.408 --> 09:12.273
Meredith is in Operations?

09:12.410 --> 09:15.573
What should I tell her?
Bad day, in-laws in town?

09:15.780 --> 09:18.772
I'm going to see Lewyn about
the 900s. Stop worrying.

09:18.916 --> 09:22.579
If there was bad news Garvin
would've sent Phil Blackburn.

09:28.826 --> 09:29.656
Phil.

09:30.862 --> 09:32.921
Are you coming to see me?

09:33.364 --> 09:34.922
No. Why?

09:35.099 --> 09:36.794
Nothing. How are you?

09:36.934 --> 09:40.028
How are you, Tom?
You look all beat up.

09:40.204 --> 09:41.193
I do?

09:41.372 --> 09:45.103
You're letting it get to you.
Don't take it personally.

09:45.309 --> 09:46.867
Take what personally?

09:47.044 --> 09:49.035
Maybe it's just a rumor.

09:49.213 --> 09:50.441
What's a rumor?

09:50.615 --> 09:54.051
I don't want to spread rumors.
That's how these things get started.

09:54.218 --> 09:55.207
You mean Austin?

09:55.386 --> 09:56.375
Who said that?

09:56.554 --> 09:57.612
What am I missing?

09:58.222 --> 10:01.055
I can't believe he didn't tell you.
He's so perverse.

10:01.225 --> 10:02.192
Tell me what?

10:03.628 --> 10:05.220
So, how's Susan?

10:06.130 --> 10:07.620
Susan's good.

10:07.832 --> 10:09.322
-How's Lonnie?
-Great.

10:11.569 --> 10:14.834
-Did you know she got tenure?
-That's great.

10:17.909 --> 10:19.968
Here's my stop.

10:23.247 --> 10:25.238
I tried to explain to Garvin.

10:25.583 --> 10:27.642
You know him, he's like a child.

10:27.852 --> 10:31.413
Fuck your feelings if they
interfere with his surprise.

10:31.589 --> 10:35.081
-What surprise?
-Rumor is you're getting passed over.

10:37.094 --> 10:38.527
So I'm not getting the VP job?

10:38.596 --> 10:39.654
That's the rumor.

10:39.864 --> 10:41.855
Rumors are always true.

10:41.999 --> 10:43.364
Garvin didn't say anything?

10:43.501 --> 10:46.493
Came by the office. I was late,
Susan had a conference.

10:46.671 --> 10:49.105
-You were late? Today?
-Why're you in Seattle?

10:49.273 --> 10:50.865
Good to see you again.

10:56.881 --> 11:01.614
Somebody tells Garvin I was talking to
you.... You know how he is about leaks.

11:01.886 --> 11:04.116
Leak? I thought it was a rumor.

11:04.288 --> 11:07.951
It was different before.
I could watch your back.

11:08.125 --> 11:10.525
Who gets the job, Stephanie Kaplan?

11:10.695 --> 11:12.890
Rumor is he went outside the group.

11:13.030 --> 11:15.624
You'd still head up Manufacturing...

11:15.800 --> 11:17.028
...presumably.

11:19.704 --> 11:20.796
Wait a minute.

11:22.206 --> 11:23.901
I might be out of a job?

11:24.141 --> 11:25.631
Don't get paranoid.

11:25.810 --> 11:26.970
I'm a quick learner.

11:27.144 --> 11:31.308
You wouldn't make someone VP and
not let them appoint their own team.

11:31.482 --> 11:33.211
How would that look?

11:34.151 --> 11:36.051
Am I out of a job?

11:36.988 --> 11:38.649
Come on, Tom.

11:38.990 --> 11:40.821
I'm already out on a limb.

11:51.068 --> 11:53.434
Are you okay? You want a Prozac?

11:53.571 --> 11:55.664
No, I'm fine.

11:56.073 --> 11:58.667
I'm disappointed, but I'm fine.

12:04.448 --> 12:05.506
You sure?

12:06.350 --> 12:10.013
Don't worry about me. I'm a
stockholder. Whatever's...

12:10.187 --> 12:11.745
...best for the company...

12:34.045 --> 12:38.209
Leave a message for Susan, Tom,
Matt and Eliza, after the beep.

12:38.382 --> 12:40.043
Thanks for calling. Bye.

12:46.490 --> 12:49.288
-Obviously, he's disappointed.
-But he took it well?

12:49.493 --> 12:51.620
Overall, I'd say yes.

12:51.796 --> 12:55.232
No bumps before the merger.
I don't want him quitting.

12:55.399 --> 12:56.889
It's up to you.

12:57.068 --> 12:59.502
Just one big happy family.

12:59.637 --> 13:00.899
You got that?

13:01.238 --> 13:06.141
I have to say, going down to see
him this morning was a masterstroke.

13:06.510 --> 13:08.808
It really put him on the defensive.

13:09.013 --> 13:10.742
I'll keep an eye on him.

13:10.915 --> 13:12.644
He'll get on the program.

13:12.817 --> 13:15.581
When push comes to shove,
he has no guts.

13:23.594 --> 13:26.324
Let me ask you something.
You know Susan.

13:27.765 --> 13:29.528
If I heard a rumor about the...

13:29.667 --> 13:31.658
...future of the company...

13:32.436 --> 13:33.664
...my future...

13:34.038 --> 13:36.768
...you know, nothing crazy,
a real rumor...

13:37.541 --> 13:41.102
...what would Susan say?
You think she'd say to see Garvin?

14:00.197 --> 14:01.789
Here's someone you should meet.

14:02.066 --> 14:04.364
Tom Sanders. He heads up Manufacturing.

14:04.568 --> 14:07.128
Steven Chase, Crescent Capital.
John Conley.

14:07.304 --> 14:08.464
You're John Conley?

14:08.806 --> 14:12.367
Junior. Dad's coming on Friday
with members of the Board.

14:12.710 --> 14:15.474
-Catch you at the lunch.
-Tom, come in.

14:16.714 --> 14:18.375
You wanted to see me.

14:18.582 --> 14:21.642
Yeah, sorry about this morning.
You know how kids are.

14:21.819 --> 14:24.310
Have you met Meredith Johnson?

14:25.156 --> 14:27.716
What's wrong? That's a
hello you'd give to a rash.

14:27.892 --> 14:30.156
I'm preoccupied. It's not you.

14:30.327 --> 14:32.659
We go way back. He broke my heart.

14:32.830 --> 14:34.388
She's making that up.

14:34.598 --> 14:37.226
I thought your heart
was made of plastic.

14:37.401 --> 14:39.232
He said I could be anything I wanted.

14:39.403 --> 14:41.394
-He was right.
-It was a line.

14:41.605 --> 14:44.005
-It wasn't a line.
-I didn't know you were acquainted.

14:44.175 --> 14:47.838
Wilde said, ''I like a man with a
future and a woman with a past.''

14:48.012 --> 14:49.673
I heard you were in Operations.

14:50.748 --> 14:53.012
I don't know. Am I?

14:54.351 --> 14:58.617
The last few years I've been cleaning
up the mess Bob made of this company.

14:59.123 --> 15:01.523
If it's such a mess, why am I so rich?

15:01.692 --> 15:03.683
Yes, but you're a lot richer now.

15:03.861 --> 15:05.852
We should catch up. Get together.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.122
I'd love that.

15:07.264 --> 15:08.925
Plenty of time now.

15:09.366 --> 15:12.529
Flying over Wyoming, I
thought the merger was dead.

15:12.703 --> 15:17.265
Conley was choking on the valuation.
The spin-off was Meredith's idea.

15:17.441 --> 15:19.932
Conley thinks it was their idea.

15:20.211 --> 15:22.941
-Really?
-Lit them up like a Christmas tree.

15:23.147 --> 15:24.375
She saved the merger.

15:24.648 --> 15:27.640
You have money now.
You can even buy a new tie.

15:30.721 --> 15:33.884
So, what was it you
wanted to see me about?

15:36.360 --> 15:40.160
Meredith-fucking-Johnson!
Son-of-a-bitch. Goddamn Garvin.

15:40.331 --> 15:41.355
-What happened?
-I didn't get it.

15:41.532 --> 15:43.591
-You're not the new VP?
-He announced it?

15:43.767 --> 15:46.702
It was a secret. He's got
her installed in the office...

15:46.871 --> 15:48.862
...bouncing quips back and forth.

15:49.039 --> 15:49.869
Who?

15:50.040 --> 15:52.440
-Who's she?
-Will this affect the spin-off?

15:52.610 --> 15:56.376
She doesn't know the difference
between software and a sweater.

15:56.547 --> 15:58.037
What aren't you telling us?

15:58.215 --> 16:02.276
I might be out of a job.
You know what it's like out there?

16:02.453 --> 16:03.943
What about the spin-off?

16:04.121 --> 16:08.387
They didn't tell me about me!
Would they tell me about the spin-off?!

16:10.895 --> 16:12.385
I'm sorry.

16:13.631 --> 16:16.464
This is the worst day of my life.
All right?

16:17.234 --> 16:18.394
Who is she?

16:18.569 --> 16:20.400
Let me guess: attractive?

16:20.638 --> 16:22.071
What does that matter?

16:22.239 --> 16:24.139
Nipples like pencil erasers?

16:24.308 --> 16:26.469
She's attractive. Very attractive.

16:26.644 --> 16:27.906
Sleeping with Garvin?

16:28.078 --> 16:29.807
That's why he got a Nordic Track.

16:29.980 --> 16:32.642
It's a curse to be me.
Life holds no surprises.

16:32.816 --> 16:34.647
This is such a cliche.

16:34.919 --> 16:37.479
How do you think a
cliche becomes a cliche?

16:37.655 --> 16:39.748
You mean like, ''Size doesn't matter''?

16:40.758 --> 16:42.419
I have a thing for you.

16:42.593 --> 16:45.585
All right, please, can
we get some work done?

16:45.763 --> 16:48.254
We got a small problem with Arcamax.

16:48.432 --> 16:50.332
-It's not the design.
-It's not the code.

16:50.501 --> 16:54.938
Any woman must be twice as good as
a man and work harder for less pay.

16:55.105 --> 16:56.936
Cliche grande.

16:57.107 --> 16:59.007
How does a cliche become one?

16:59.176 --> 17:02.612
It is very weird. We know
nothing about this woman.

17:02.780 --> 17:03.610
I do.

17:03.847 --> 17:05.508
I had a thing with her.

17:06.450 --> 17:07.781
You are amazing.

17:08.452 --> 17:09.942
It was years ago.

17:10.354 --> 17:12.617
You've seen more ass than a rental car.

17:12.856 --> 17:16.019
Get a few more women in your
life so you can be a census.

17:16.359 --> 17:18.123
Maybe you can sleep your way up.

17:18.462 --> 17:19.451
Right.

17:19.630 --> 17:22.690
Wait, why? Why her and not Tom?
He's not attractive?

17:22.866 --> 17:24.696
Men and women are different.

17:24.867 --> 17:26.460
Not in a way that matters to you.

17:27.471 --> 17:29.029
Are you saying I'm a virgin?

17:41.352 --> 17:44.082
Meanwhile, you were asking
me about the spin-off.

17:44.588 --> 17:46.681
Garvin said it was her idea.

17:53.931 --> 17:56.593
It's always such a
pleasure to come here...

17:56.800 --> 17:59.291
...and be with the
Advanced Products Group.

17:59.436 --> 18:02.200
I feel such a warmth
for the people here.

18:02.373 --> 18:06.207
I feel a kinship. And I've
always wanted to give you...

18:06.377 --> 18:07.867
Is this seat taken?

18:08.712 --> 18:12.204
...the most advanced original
leadership that I could.

18:12.383 --> 18:13.816
How are you?

18:13.951 --> 18:17.614
-Sorry you didn't get the promotion.
-I'm sorry you didn't get it either.

18:18.889 --> 18:20.220
How long have you known?

18:22.626 --> 18:24.218
Really? That long?

18:24.628 --> 18:27.392
Every time I've wanted
to promote a woman...

18:27.564 --> 18:29.464
...to break the glass ceiling...

18:29.633 --> 18:31.828
...it's always the same story:

18:31.969 --> 18:34.233
''But, Bob.... But, Bob....''

18:35.139 --> 18:40.076
I've thought about it often since my
daughter's death, that had she lived...

18:40.244 --> 18:42.474
...it would be extremely rare...

18:42.646 --> 18:44.910
...that she ever got to run a company.

18:46.083 --> 18:48.847
So it has a special meaning
for me when I tell you...

18:48.986 --> 18:51.147
...that when we announce the merger...

18:52.156 --> 18:56.490
...we will also announce the new VP
for Advanced Operations and Planning...

18:56.660 --> 18:57.752
...in Seattle...

18:58.929 --> 18:59.987
...will be Meredith Johnson.

19:09.440 --> 19:10.998
Unbelievable.

19:13.377 --> 19:16.005
Thanks, Bob. Can I have the lights?

19:22.586 --> 19:27.489
The Advanced Products Group has been the
heart of DigiCom for the last 10 years.

19:27.958 --> 19:31.689
Advanced Products has historically
consisted of 4 divisions:

19:32.696 --> 19:35.392
You seem to be spending
more time up here.

19:35.532 --> 19:39.525
My son's a freshman at the university.
This way I get to see more of him.

19:39.703 --> 19:42.137
I thought it had to do with the merger.

19:42.639 --> 19:45.130
This merger means everything to Garvin.

19:45.309 --> 19:49.643
Give a man a $100 million and you
create a frustrated billionaire.

19:50.447 --> 19:53.780
The new compression algorithms
will shift industry standards...

19:53.951 --> 19:57.011
...to full-res digitized
video at 60 fields a second...

19:57.287 --> 20:00.518
...with platform-independent
RlSC processors supported by...

20:00.691 --> 20:02.352
...a 32-bit color-active...

20:02.526 --> 20:04.016
Conley's a conservative company.

20:04.695 --> 20:06.686
Is Meredith conservative?

20:07.131 --> 20:08.462
I don't know.

20:08.966 --> 20:10.695
I thought you knew her.

20:12.136 --> 20:14.468
Is there anything you don't know?

20:15.372 --> 20:17.363
We offer, through technology...

20:17.541 --> 20:21.136
...what religion and revolution
have promised but never delivered:

20:21.311 --> 20:23.142
Freedom from the physical body.

20:23.981 --> 20:26.040
Freedom from race and gender...

20:26.216 --> 20:30.312
...from nationality and personality,
from place and time.

20:30.487 --> 20:33.251
Communicating by cellular
phone and hand-held computer...

20:33.457 --> 20:35.755
...PDA and built-in fax modem...

20:35.959 --> 20:38.951
...we can relate to each
other as pure consciousness.

20:44.368 --> 20:47.360
Smart, touching base with
all the division heads.

20:47.538 --> 20:50.029
She didn't name them in her speech.

20:52.543 --> 20:53.874
Does it mean something?

20:54.778 --> 20:56.712
Only if she plans to make changes.

20:58.215 --> 21:01.048
Phil said she wasn't planning
on making any changes.

21:02.219 --> 21:03.686
You know Meredith.

21:06.990 --> 21:08.218
Wait a minute.

21:08.392 --> 21:10.553
I must know, am I out of a job?

21:11.728 --> 21:14.060
What was she bending your ear about?

21:14.231 --> 21:16.495
Stephanie? Nothing. Just small talk.

21:16.633 --> 21:19.397
What, all of a sudden
there's Stephanie Lite?

21:19.570 --> 21:22.801
She was talking about her
son at the university.

21:23.006 --> 21:25.304
Sorry I didn't get to mention you.

21:25.509 --> 21:26.407
That's fine.

21:26.577 --> 21:29.637
I'm jammed all day but why
don't you come up at 7?

21:29.813 --> 21:32.509
We'll have a drink and
catch up on business.

21:32.916 --> 21:34.076
Great.

21:34.251 --> 21:37.015
I remember how you liked a good
bottle of wine. I'll get one.

21:44.094 --> 21:46.654
What's she want
to see you at 7 about?

21:46.830 --> 21:51.597
Probably the Arcamax problems. We must
discuss it before Conley asks questions.

21:51.768 --> 21:53.668
She doesn't give you a boner?

21:53.837 --> 21:56.829
Because, you know,
I definitely have lift-off.

21:57.040 --> 21:58.940
What about you? You got a woody?

21:59.109 --> 22:00.542
She's very nice.

22:00.677 --> 22:03.168
-I'll let you know what happens.
-Don't do that.

22:03.347 --> 22:07.181
You have a sexual urge every
20 minutes. It's a physical certainty.

22:07.451 --> 22:09.681
It's hard-wired into your brain.

22:09.853 --> 22:13.619
You can't fight it. Why would
you want to? Live a little.

22:13.790 --> 22:16.782
Ten years from now you'll need
a forklift to get a hard on.

22:17.461 --> 22:18.621
I'll call you.

22:18.795 --> 22:20.126
I'll count the minutes.

22:23.967 --> 22:26.299
Where've you been all day?

22:28.805 --> 22:30.363
I didn't get it.

22:30.574 --> 22:34.476
No, they went outside the division.
Someone from Operations.

22:36.313 --> 22:38.873
What can I say? I got passed over.

22:40.384 --> 22:41.715
What can I say?

22:43.086 --> 22:45.714
So, did you get the
tickets for Disneyland?

22:47.224 --> 22:49.988
No, I know, but I promised
the guy and it's...

22:50.160 --> 22:51.491
Mohammed Jafar.

22:55.165 --> 22:58.828
Thanks a lot. Probably won't
be home for dinner tonight.

23:02.673 --> 23:05.164
I love you too. Bye.

23:53.590 --> 23:56.024
Are there any asset sale triggers?

23:56.793 --> 23:57.885
In the indenture?

24:01.732 --> 24:03.290
Will you do me a favor?

24:03.967 --> 24:06.663
Alan, Brown will go 250 on this, easy.

24:06.803 --> 24:09.169
Let's just do this thing.

24:11.241 --> 24:13.675
Not a bad idea for a girl.

24:15.412 --> 24:17.312
Let's talk first thing.

24:17.481 --> 24:18.675
'91 Pahlmeyer.

24:18.815 --> 24:20.476
I've looked all over for it.

24:20.751 --> 24:23.413
I like all the boys
under me to be happy.

24:24.488 --> 24:25.420
Congratulations.

24:25.822 --> 24:26.914
Thank you.

24:31.595 --> 24:34.428
I brought the files up for
Arcamax if you want to see them.

24:35.098 --> 24:36.429
Show me your pictures.

24:36.600 --> 24:37.931
The diagrams?

24:38.101 --> 24:40.194
Your family. You have pictures?

24:40.337 --> 24:41.599
Yeah, sure.

24:48.445 --> 24:49.935
Here's.... Here.

24:50.447 --> 24:54.008
That's Matthew.
That's Eliza at Halloween.

24:55.218 --> 24:57.345
And here's Susan with the kids.

24:57.788 --> 25:00.518
She looks like she always
has food in the refrigerator.

25:00.724 --> 25:04.455
-She never lost the baby weight--
-She doesn't look like a refrigerator.

25:04.628 --> 25:06.789
I mean, she's made a home for you.

25:07.464 --> 25:10.627
In my fridge I've got some
champagne and an orange.

25:10.801 --> 25:12.359
Doesn't Eliza look pretty?

25:12.636 --> 25:14.126
She looks like Susan.

25:16.239 --> 25:17.866
It can be inhibiting.

25:18.041 --> 25:20.475
-What's that?
-Domesticity.

25:20.877 --> 25:22.242
You'd be surprised.

25:22.546 --> 25:24.741
You can't jump her from behind...

25:24.881 --> 25:29.045
...because you get excited by the
way she bends to pick up the soap.

25:30.053 --> 25:31.247
Remember that?

25:32.556 --> 25:33.887
I remember that.

25:34.057 --> 25:35.388
And you miss it.

25:37.828 --> 25:39.159
There's compensations.

25:39.329 --> 25:42.560
Of course. Life's a
series of trade-offs.

25:42.766 --> 25:44.825
I wouldn't trade what I have.

25:45.001 --> 25:48.835
I wouldn't want you to.
That's exactly why I can trust you.

25:49.339 --> 25:51.398
You have more to lose than I do.

25:57.514 --> 26:01.416
I'll bring you up to speed on
the problems with the drives.

26:01.585 --> 26:04.019
You kept in good shape, Tom.

26:04.354 --> 26:06.083
Nice and hard.

26:07.090 --> 26:08.421
Thank you.

26:21.338 --> 26:22.896
It's different now.

26:23.840 --> 26:25.831
You're my boss.

26:26.243 --> 26:27.676
It's different.

26:31.681 --> 26:32.670
Okay.

26:33.183 --> 26:36.016
Rub my shoulders and I'll
listen to your problems.

26:50.433 --> 26:53.766
The specs and the seek times
call for 100 milliseconds.

26:53.937 --> 26:57.771
We have that on the prototypes.
But the drives coming off-line--

26:57.941 --> 27:00.375
-Are the drives here?
-It might be a chip.

27:00.544 --> 27:02.876
-Answer my question.
-I'm trying to.

27:03.713 --> 27:07.774
Understand the controller chip
positions the split optics.

27:07.951 --> 27:09.282
I'll show you the schematic.

27:09.452 --> 27:11.215
No, no, no, no. Rub.

27:16.293 --> 27:18.784
You can't understand the problem--

27:18.962 --> 27:21.055
-Do you have the drives?
-Arthur sent 5--

27:22.966 --> 27:24.957
-I said no calls.
-It's Mr. Garvin.

27:25.135 --> 27:26.625
But after that, nobody.

27:26.970 --> 27:29.131
Is it all right if I leave for the day?

27:29.306 --> 27:30.967
That's fine, Mrs. Ross.

27:38.148 --> 27:40.582
You'd rather talk about other things...

27:40.750 --> 27:43.583
...than answer my question
because you don't know.

27:43.753 --> 27:47.814
You don't know what the problem is.
But you can't say, ''I don't know''...

27:47.991 --> 27:52.655
...because in your mind that means
you lose. You're worthless. Men!

27:52.829 --> 27:55.764
-What will you tell Conley?
-I can't lie to them.

27:55.932 --> 27:59.095
Talk about the prototypes. They work.

27:59.269 --> 28:00.827
Focus on the positive.

28:01.004 --> 28:03.768
We're on-line. It's not
about the prototypes.

28:03.940 --> 28:07.774
-They want to know if you can build it.
-I understand that--

28:07.944 --> 28:10.105
Do you have a problem working for me?

28:11.348 --> 28:12.337
No.

28:14.951 --> 28:15.849
Hi, Bob.

28:17.120 --> 28:20.283
You don't want to hear
about my hard day.

28:21.291 --> 28:23.191
Yes, that's hard work.

28:23.960 --> 28:25.860
Let me get my docs together.

28:27.631 --> 28:32.193
The merger is about people, not Arcamax.
They're comfortable with me and Bob.

28:32.369 --> 28:36.203
This isn't about some CD-ROM
that'll be obsolete in a year.

28:36.339 --> 28:39.399
If they ask, then you
tell them you don't know.

28:39.709 --> 28:41.199
Hi, Bob, I'm here.

28:41.478 --> 28:43.537
I've got a great idea about that.

28:44.214 --> 28:45.203
Go ahead.

28:48.151 --> 28:49.641
Lewyn, this is Sanders.

28:49.819 --> 28:54.722
I've discussed the drives with Meredith.
She says don't tell the Conley people...

28:54.891 --> 28:57.826
...until we know exactly
what the problems are.

28:57.994 --> 29:01.486
That is the line for the 8 a.m.
meeting tomorrow--

29:02.332 --> 29:04.061
Let's get down to business.

29:04.501 --> 29:08.164
Wait a sec, wait a sec.
Meredith, wait a second.

29:13.243 --> 29:16.906
-There, was that so bad?
-That's not so bad, it's just--

29:18.415 --> 29:21.509
Come on, while there's still
a chance we might get caught.

29:23.253 --> 29:24.743
No, no.

29:25.188 --> 29:27.088
Oh, yes, I think so.

29:33.530 --> 29:37.022
Some things never change, and
some things just get better.

29:37.200 --> 29:38.758
Meredith, come on.

29:45.208 --> 29:47.369
-Remember all the things we did?
-I remember.

29:48.111 --> 29:50.875
Things nobody knows about you but me.

29:52.882 --> 29:54.543
All our secrets.

29:58.788 --> 30:01.450
Just lie back and let me take you.

30:02.292 --> 30:04.783
I could have anybody and I picked you.

30:05.962 --> 30:08.123
Now you've got all the power.

30:16.406 --> 30:18.567
You've got something I want.

30:20.977 --> 30:23.070
Doesn't that make you feel good?

30:25.415 --> 30:27.406
Don't stop me. Come on.

30:29.319 --> 30:31.651
Don't worry, I'm not going to bite.

30:32.155 --> 30:34.646
Let me do whatever I want.

30:35.925 --> 30:39.258
You just lie back and
let me be the boss.

31:00.283 --> 31:03.116
Wait a second. Wait a second.
Wait a minute.

31:04.521 --> 31:05.783
What?

31:06.456 --> 31:08.515
Look, nobody has to know.

31:08.691 --> 31:10.352
Nobody gets hurt.

31:10.627 --> 31:14.119
It's just a meeting
between two colleagues.

31:14.798 --> 31:17.858
Just another dull day in
the computer business.

31:24.207 --> 31:25.469
No, honey.

31:32.882 --> 31:33.871
Don't!

31:37.220 --> 31:38.312
Here.

31:40.723 --> 31:42.315
-Want to get fucked?
-Do it.

31:42.492 --> 31:43.982
Is that what you want?

31:45.495 --> 31:46.655
Come on.

31:47.397 --> 31:48.887
Is that what you want?

31:55.238 --> 31:57.069
You just stay hard.

32:03.179 --> 32:04.669
Oh, God.

32:19.028 --> 32:20.586
You bad boy.

32:22.432 --> 32:24.093
Come on, baby.

32:35.278 --> 32:39.715
Come on. You going to fuck me?
You going to fuck me?!

32:45.054 --> 32:46.112
Put it in.

32:50.627 --> 32:52.458
God, look at us.

32:53.396 --> 32:54.454
Go inside me.

32:54.964 --> 32:55.953
Come on.

32:57.066 --> 32:58.294
-I can't do this.
-Do it.

32:58.468 --> 32:59.400
I won't.

32:59.636 --> 33:00.398
Now!

33:00.570 --> 33:02.629
-I'm not going to do this!
-Now!

33:02.805 --> 33:04.295
You can't just stop!

33:04.474 --> 33:06.806
-Come on.
-No! Goddamn!

33:17.253 --> 33:21.087
You stick your dick in my mouth
then get an attack of morality?

33:23.826 --> 33:25.657
This never happened.

33:26.930 --> 33:29.490
You never used to be this way.

33:34.103 --> 33:35.832
I have a family now.

33:36.105 --> 33:38.505
A family made you stupid.

33:40.343 --> 33:43.938
You take those two champagne
bottles in your refrigerator...

33:44.113 --> 33:45.444
...and fuck them.

33:48.017 --> 33:50.008
You son-of-a-bitch.

33:51.354 --> 33:54.118
You get back here and
finish what you started.

33:54.290 --> 33:55.450
You hear me?

33:55.692 --> 33:56.624
Do you?

33:57.026 --> 33:59.961
Come back and finish what
you started or you are dead!

34:00.129 --> 34:02.290
You are fucking dead!

35:13.102 --> 35:14.763
Shit, it's dead.

35:50.573 --> 35:54.475
You are hereby notified that we
will hold your client liable--

35:55.078 --> 35:57.137
I didn't hear you come in.

35:57.413 --> 35:59.142
I'm going to take a shower.

35:59.315 --> 36:02.250
-No kiss?
-I just feel kind of shitty, you know.

36:02.418 --> 36:03.817
Screw them.

36:04.087 --> 36:07.818
-They don't deserve you.
-Can you get me a beer?

36:26.776 --> 36:30.109
Thanks. Before I forget,
could you do me a favor?

36:30.279 --> 36:32.008
The cellular's battery's dead.

36:32.181 --> 36:35.275
Sure. I thought they were
supposed to last all day?

36:35.451 --> 36:36.611
I thought so.

36:37.854 --> 36:39.116
Who's Meredith Johnson?

36:39.288 --> 36:40.346
What?

36:41.023 --> 36:42.615
Meredith Johnson.

36:43.192 --> 36:45.626
She called just before you got home.

36:46.863 --> 36:48.194
She called?

36:48.364 --> 36:50.525
Yeah, about 10 minutes ago.

36:53.703 --> 36:56.968
She said the 8 a.m.
had been pushed back to 8:30.

36:57.140 --> 37:00.871
-Who is she?
-She's the one, the new VP.

37:01.544 --> 37:02.806
She's the one?

37:02.979 --> 37:04.970
She came from the Valley.

37:05.314 --> 37:06.474
How old is she?

37:06.649 --> 37:09.209
I don't know. 33, maybe.

37:09.385 --> 37:11.376
That's young for that job.

37:12.221 --> 37:14.883
-Had you ever heard of her?
-She's a face guy.

37:15.057 --> 37:19.892
She made the merger happen. Now
she's Garvin's fair-haired...whatever.

37:21.998 --> 37:25.729
Where'd she come from?
Has she any technical background?

37:25.902 --> 37:29.338
No. That's the thing with the merger.
Everything's changed.

37:29.739 --> 37:33.334
That's not the worst thing in the world.
She'll crash and burn.

37:33.509 --> 37:35.067
Then they'll appreciate you.

37:35.244 --> 37:37.405
Things aren't easy out there.

37:37.580 --> 37:39.172
So quit...

37:39.682 --> 37:41.912
...rather than let them treat you badly.

37:42.084 --> 37:45.019
We might lose everything,
including the stock options.

37:45.188 --> 37:47.247
I don't care about stock options.

37:47.423 --> 37:48.685
I'll work full-time.

37:48.858 --> 37:51.349
I'm capable of supporting our family.

37:51.527 --> 37:52.858
Just trying to help.

37:53.429 --> 37:55.363
You're too nice sometimes.

37:55.531 --> 37:58.932
I don't need you to fight
my battles for me, thanks.

38:00.436 --> 38:04.600
Right now some lucky girl in
the building will come after me.

38:06.542 --> 38:08.772
I deserve that, but ask yourself...

38:09.111 --> 38:13.047
...why does a man go with another
girl? He's unhappy at home.

38:13.216 --> 38:15.116
Because he's lonely.

38:15.384 --> 38:18.444
But that was before you, Fran.
I've stopped running.

38:19.956 --> 38:23.392
Why are you wearing a T-shirt?
You never do.

38:23.559 --> 38:26.119
I don't know. Just a little cold.

38:27.964 --> 38:29.795
What are you going to do?

38:31.634 --> 38:33.795
Grin and bear it, like I usually do.

38:33.870 --> 38:35.337
And hope it doesn't get worse.

38:52.455 --> 38:53.547
Morning.

38:53.689 --> 38:54.951
Morning, Bob.

38:57.627 --> 38:59.117
That's a nice suit.

39:01.063 --> 39:02.360
Nice fabric.

39:02.965 --> 39:04.296
Can I feel it?

39:06.202 --> 39:07.863
What is that? Wool?

39:08.070 --> 39:10.061
With a little bit of viscose.

39:10.506 --> 39:13.669
That's what makes the
pants drape so well.

39:16.379 --> 39:17.710
You work out?

39:17.880 --> 39:21.646
When I get a chance, Bob.
It's been busy lately.

39:24.086 --> 39:25.644
I've always liked you.

39:30.726 --> 39:32.660
Now you have the power.

39:33.496 --> 39:35.327
You have something I want.

39:35.498 --> 39:36.430
Come on.

39:55.551 --> 39:58.486
The computer takes the
information from the database...

39:58.654 --> 40:02.055
...and constructs an environment
that is projected in the headset.

40:02.224 --> 40:05.216
When the user walks on
the pad, he or she...

40:05.394 --> 40:10.161
...feels like they're walking in a hall
with drawers of files on all sides.

40:10.333 --> 40:12.665
The user can stop, open any file...

40:12.835 --> 40:17.499
...and look at the data. The laser
scanners are for body representation.

40:17.673 --> 40:19.903
-That's amazing.
-It's cool, isn't it?

40:26.349 --> 40:27.407
Where is everyone?

40:27.583 --> 40:30.916
They left 15 minutes ago.
Don Cherry's demo-ing the Corridor.

40:31.087 --> 40:32.679
The meeting's at 8:30.

40:32.855 --> 40:36.518
No, 7:30. It got pushed up.
Nobody told you?

40:36.692 --> 40:41.095
If someone wants to log on with a
regular computer, what they'll see...

40:42.098 --> 40:46.694
...is a model of themselves with a
photo that's pulled up from a data file.

40:47.203 --> 40:49.262
Hey, I know you.

40:49.438 --> 40:52.430
The photo bears some
resemblance to me, I admit.

40:52.875 --> 40:55.275
An inside joke here at the company.

40:55.444 --> 40:57.776
We've also constructed virtual help.

40:57.947 --> 41:00.211
Users always need on-line help.

41:00.383 --> 41:02.283
We created an angel to help you.

41:06.956 --> 41:08.287
Welcome to the Corridor.

41:09.725 --> 41:11.283
The same face.

41:11.961 --> 41:13.121
Angel...

41:13.396 --> 41:16.126
...how do I open this drawer?

41:16.465 --> 41:18.126
What's the angel saying?

41:18.300 --> 41:20.131
That's between them.

41:20.403 --> 41:23.895
We don't see the Corridor as a
product in the marketplace now.

41:24.073 --> 41:27.634
This is something that we worked
up to demonstrate the potential...

41:27.810 --> 41:29.801
...of virtual reality technology.

41:30.980 --> 41:32.470
This looks good.

41:34.150 --> 41:36.482
Hold on. What's that?

41:36.652 --> 41:38.745
I believe it's your financial records.

41:39.422 --> 41:41.822
Turn that damn thing off.

41:41.991 --> 41:42.821
Sorry.

41:43.092 --> 41:47.756
In the final system there will be
safeguards that will control access.

41:50.499 --> 41:52.990
So glad you could join us.

41:53.269 --> 41:56.102
That was a sweet entrance, my friend.

41:56.272 --> 42:01.005
Did the ferry hit an iceberg? You were
going to call me after meeting Meredith.

42:01.177 --> 42:04.442
I called you from her office.
Left a message.

42:04.613 --> 42:08.447
There was nothing on my machine.
Then you're late again.

42:08.617 --> 42:10.847
Thank God Meredith
led the discussion.

42:11.787 --> 42:15.518
Hey, pal, I left a message
on your machine, all right?

42:15.691 --> 42:17.181
Check it out.

42:17.793 --> 42:19.454
Did you get my message?

42:20.196 --> 42:23.290
You told Susan the meeting
had been moved to 8:30.

42:23.466 --> 42:28.301
I said 7:30. If your wife can't take
a fucking message, get a machine.

42:37.546 --> 42:39.537
-There you go, Mr. Sanders.
-Thank you.

42:39.715 --> 42:41.046
You're welcome.

42:42.051 --> 42:43.382
Full house today.

42:49.558 --> 42:52.322
Meredith has been getting us
up to speed on the Arcamax.

42:52.495 --> 42:54.486
We'd like your read on it.

42:55.164 --> 42:57.394
Meredith said there are problems.

42:57.566 --> 43:00.160
You might have to go back
to the drawing board.

43:01.504 --> 43:04.905
I'm sorry if I conveyed that
impression to Meredith.

43:05.174 --> 43:07.904
I'm convinced we can
manufacture them.

43:08.077 --> 43:10.341
How many of the drives meet specs?

43:11.247 --> 43:13.238
I don't have that information with me.

43:13.415 --> 43:17.909
Meredith told us the line is running
at 29%. Is that approximately right?

43:18.687 --> 43:20.746
The seek times are off-specs.

43:20.923 --> 43:23.915
There's a power flicker in the screen?

43:24.360 --> 43:26.089
-Right?
-That's right.

43:26.262 --> 43:29.527
With the merger impending,
shouldn't you have told someone?

43:29.698 --> 43:33.361
The merger isn't about a CD-ROM
that might be obsolete in a year.

43:33.536 --> 43:35.367
It's about people.

43:35.538 --> 43:39.269
-It'll be obsolete in a year?
-The promise of the Arcamax...

43:39.441 --> 43:42.103
...was a central factor in this merger.

43:42.278 --> 43:45.873
I may be at fault. Tom said the
problem with the drives was serious.

43:46.048 --> 43:46.946
Not so serious.

43:47.116 --> 43:48.105
Don't cover up.

43:48.284 --> 43:51.276
-I'm not covering anything up.
-Give us worst case.

43:51.453 --> 43:55.389
We go back to the drawing boards
and we're down for 9 months.

43:56.058 --> 43:57.047
Nine months?

43:57.226 --> 43:58.716
Meredith said 6 weeks.

43:59.395 --> 44:04.059
Nobody likes to go back to the board,
but it can be an advantage.

44:04.300 --> 44:06.063
Is there a problem?

44:06.235 --> 44:09.227
This isn't an inquisition.
I feel like I'm pulling teeth.

44:09.405 --> 44:13.569
John just wants to get a handle on
what the problems are with the lines.

44:15.077 --> 44:18.569
-I don't know is the honest answer.
-Wait a minute.

44:19.582 --> 44:21.641
You are head of Manufacturing.

44:21.817 --> 44:25.412
You are in charge of Arcamax.
There are problems with it...

44:25.588 --> 44:29.922
...that could take 9 months to fix,
which I assume means a year.

44:30.092 --> 44:31.753
And the bottom line is...

44:32.428 --> 44:34.259
...you don't know?

44:35.531 --> 44:36.964
Goddamn it!

44:37.800 --> 44:39.290
Goddamn it!

44:39.468 --> 44:41.026
Jesus Christ!

44:46.709 --> 44:50.201
I wanted to see you. It's not
going to work out with Meredith.

44:50.412 --> 44:52.642
-Evidently not.
-She set me up.

44:52.815 --> 44:53.543
I saw.

44:53.716 --> 44:55.650
-She set me up.
-Sit down.

44:55.818 --> 44:58.981
-Why? What'd I do?
-Please, would you just sit.

45:02.157 --> 45:05.217
Meredith told me about
your meeting last night.

45:05.427 --> 45:06.416
What?

45:09.665 --> 45:11.064
What'd she say?

45:11.433 --> 45:15.062
She wants to handle the intervention
internally, which is best.

45:15.237 --> 45:18.502
-She still cares about you.
-Wait a minute.

45:19.508 --> 45:20.566
What'd she say?

45:20.843 --> 45:25.075
Not to put too fine a point on it,
she said you sexually harassed her.

45:26.015 --> 45:28.176
I sexually harassed her?

45:28.584 --> 45:31.951
-What would you call it?
-She jumped me.

45:32.187 --> 45:35.452
She jumped you? You're in denial.
That's typical.

45:35.591 --> 45:37.252
She almost raped me.

45:37.459 --> 45:40.257
You need help. You must
accept responsibility for--

45:40.462 --> 45:41.690
What about this?

45:41.864 --> 45:43.195
What about that?

45:44.199 --> 45:46.258
Looks like she defended herself.

45:46.468 --> 45:50.871
Defended herself? The woman can
kick the shit out of both of us!

45:51.040 --> 45:53.873
-It may have seemed different to you.
-I didn't harass her.

45:54.043 --> 45:55.601
She harassed me.

45:55.778 --> 45:58.474
I've never heard of a
woman harassing a man.

45:58.614 --> 45:59.876
Why're you here?

46:00.049 --> 46:03.109
-I'm here as your friend.
-My ass, you're my friend.

46:03.285 --> 46:08.120
When Garvin finds out about this, he'll
want to throw you out on your ass.

46:08.290 --> 46:10.383
Let's keep this quiet.

46:10.592 --> 46:15.256
That's what Meredith wants too.
Resolve this quickly and quietly.

46:15.431 --> 46:17.262
Want your wife to find out?

46:17.433 --> 46:19.424
We'll have to tell her at some point.

46:19.601 --> 46:23.367
They'll get the whole thing and it'll
be on the front page of the paper!

46:23.539 --> 46:26.269
I'm offering you a chance
to make a new life.

46:26.442 --> 46:29.275
Keep your family out of this mess.
Keep your job.

46:29.945 --> 46:33.210
Obviously, some kind of lateral move.

46:33.382 --> 46:36.613
When you say lateral, you
mean out of the division.

46:36.885 --> 46:38.716
You can't stay here.

46:39.054 --> 46:41.614
She's scared out of her wits.

46:41.790 --> 46:46.727
I'm not leaving this division. I spent
10 years here. I built this place.

46:47.563 --> 46:49.554
Now, we got a spin-off going on--

46:49.798 --> 46:52.130
We're thinking, you know, Austin.

46:52.801 --> 46:53.961
Austin?

46:54.303 --> 46:56.737
I told him what she said.

46:56.972 --> 46:58.735
He said the opposite happened.

46:59.475 --> 47:01.568
He said she harassed him.

47:02.311 --> 47:03.744
What?

47:03.912 --> 47:04.970
He denies it?

47:05.147 --> 47:07.581
You know, the man always denies it.

47:07.750 --> 47:09.081
Is he crazy?

47:09.251 --> 47:11.242
I offered him a move to Austin.

47:11.420 --> 47:15.652
To Austin. That's like a duck making
a lateral move to ''à l'orange.''

47:15.924 --> 47:17.824
He's too smart for that.

47:17.993 --> 47:20.985
Let's hope he's smart enough
to see he has no options.

47:21.163 --> 47:22.653
Take care of this.

47:22.831 --> 47:27.325
This is a bomb we're sitting on
that can blow everything sky-high.

47:27.503 --> 47:32.338
Meredith is key to the merger. I can't
have her involved in a sex scandal.

47:32.508 --> 47:36.103
And I won't say good-bye to
$100 million. You got that?

47:36.278 --> 47:38.610
I get the picture, Bob.

49:32.895 --> 49:35.295
10th floor. Down the hall and right.

49:42.304 --> 49:43.896
There were no witnesses?

49:44.072 --> 49:46.563
Her assistant left earlier in the night.

49:46.742 --> 49:50.974
A cleaning lady was outside the office.
I don't know what she heard.

49:51.146 --> 49:54.309
-Did you report that to anyone?
-In the morning, yeah.

49:54.483 --> 49:56.576
What was the company's response?

49:56.752 --> 49:59.653
They believed her.
They suggested I transfer to Austin.

49:59.821 --> 50:01.482
I heard they're selling Austin.

50:01.657 --> 50:06.321
The point is, if I go to Austin,
I lose everything, all right?

50:06.495 --> 50:09.658
My stock options,
everything that I worked for.

50:09.831 --> 50:11.822
Did you call anyone
after the incident?

50:12.000 --> 50:12.932
No.

50:13.101 --> 50:14.762
Did you tell your wife?

50:14.937 --> 50:15.926
Oh, boy.

50:16.104 --> 50:17.162
Why not?

50:17.506 --> 50:22.443
I didn't want to upset her. I felt
guilty being in that situation at all.

50:22.678 --> 50:25.511
How would you characterize
Miss Johnson physically?

50:25.681 --> 50:29.947
She's very pretty. She was
Miss Teenage New Mexico.

50:30.118 --> 50:31.517
So you kissed.

50:32.354 --> 50:35.687
Yes. And then she began to...rub me.

50:35.857 --> 50:37.188
Rub you where?

50:39.461 --> 50:40.860
You know....

50:43.198 --> 50:44.460
Your penis?

50:44.700 --> 50:45.860
Yes.

50:46.468 --> 50:47.799
And?

50:50.472 --> 50:52.804
I'm uncomfortable talking about it.

50:53.809 --> 50:57.040
-Because I'm a woman?
-You act like it's a game.

50:57.212 --> 51:00.545
-Why are you here?
-I want to know what my options are.

51:00.716 --> 51:02.047
What your options are?

51:02.217 --> 51:05.983
I want to know whether I can
sue her for sexual harassment.

51:06.154 --> 51:08.213
To do that you must convince a jury...

51:08.390 --> 51:12.326
...you were alone with Miss Teenage
New Mexico and you said, ''no.''

51:12.995 --> 51:14.656
Sexual harassment...

51:14.830 --> 51:16.889
...is not about sex.

51:17.666 --> 51:19.566
It is about power.

51:19.901 --> 51:21.163
She has it...

51:21.336 --> 51:22.735
...you don't.

51:23.071 --> 51:26.336
If you sue, you'll never get
another job in computers.

51:26.508 --> 51:31.411
If you don't, you'll go to Austin. Sue,
and it's news. Don't sue, it's gossip.

51:31.580 --> 51:34.572
If you sue, no one will believe you.
If you don't, your wife won't.

51:34.750 --> 51:39.244
They'll make your life hell for the
3 years until the case goes to trial.

51:39.421 --> 51:44.256
And, for that privilege, it'll
cost you a minimum of $100,000.

51:45.027 --> 51:47.860
Do you not think it's
a game, Mr. Sanders?

51:48.030 --> 51:49.691
It's a game to them.

51:50.098 --> 51:52.259
How do you feel about losing?

52:02.878 --> 52:04.539
That's what Meredith wants.

52:04.713 --> 52:08.444
To resolve it, quickly and quietly.

52:17.292 --> 52:20.125
They said she's not going
to press charges. Why?

52:20.295 --> 52:24.129
She's accused me. Why stop there?
Why not press charges?

52:24.299 --> 52:27.291
Meredith didn't press charges...

52:27.636 --> 52:29.297
...because she couldn't.

52:29.471 --> 52:31.962
DigiCom is planning a
merger with Conley-White.

52:32.140 --> 52:34.574
It is supposed to happen Friday.

52:34.743 --> 52:38.406
They think that we are as
conservative as they are.

52:38.580 --> 52:43.313
With a scandal, Conley goes to bed with
Katie Couric, wakes up to Jessica Hahn.

52:43.485 --> 52:45.749
Garvin is out $100 million.

52:46.088 --> 52:48.989
I think we might make a
plaintiff out of this guy yet.

52:49.157 --> 52:53.821
No, a potential plaintiff. I don't
have to sue. I just threaten to sue.

52:53.995 --> 52:57.658
That's a dangerous game.
Are you willing to play it?

52:58.100 --> 52:58.828
Fuck them.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.093
Now you're talking my language.

53:01.603 --> 53:02.934
For the next 3 days...

53:03.105 --> 53:07.337
...this loose cannon is in a
position to apply a lot of pressure.

53:07.509 --> 53:11.172
And they on you, Mr. Sanders.
They on you.

53:14.149 --> 53:17.414
Call security. Throw
him out on the sidewalk.

53:18.220 --> 53:21.485
We have to appear to be impartial.

53:21.656 --> 53:24.420
Keep him in his job, keep
paying him, no hassles.

53:24.559 --> 53:27.926
I made Tom Sanders.
Who the hell is he to sue me?

53:28.063 --> 53:30.224
Sexual harassment, under Title Seven.

53:30.432 --> 53:34.994
He'll file with the Human Rights
Commission if we don't fire Meredith.

53:35.337 --> 53:39.068
If he files, it becomes public.
It'd blow the deal.

53:39.241 --> 53:42.836
We realize that. So does he.
He's blackmailing us.

53:43.011 --> 53:45.172
This is America, goddamn it.

53:45.347 --> 53:48.680
The legal system is supposed
to protect people like me.

53:48.850 --> 53:50.511
It gets worse.

53:50.752 --> 53:52.686
His lawyer is...

53:52.854 --> 53:54.344
...Catherine Alvarez.

53:54.523 --> 53:59.460
Great. She'd change her name to ''TV
Listings'' just to get it in the paper.

53:59.594 --> 54:03.189
I'm trying to get them to mediate.
Keep it quiet.

54:04.199 --> 54:05.962
Mediate?

54:06.101 --> 54:08.467
I want you to cut his balls off.

54:09.204 --> 54:11.695
Did he say mediate or
split the difference?

54:11.873 --> 54:15.604
I'm just hoping he'll agree.
Alvarez will tell him not to.

54:15.777 --> 54:18.473
He'll agree.
He doesn't want this public.

54:18.613 --> 54:21.707
We pushed him too hard.
He has nothing to lose.

54:22.050 --> 54:24.541
Really? He hasn't told his wife yet.

54:26.555 --> 54:27.783
How do you know?

54:28.490 --> 54:30.287
I know Sanders, remember?

54:30.492 --> 54:31.982
He likes secrets.

54:41.002 --> 54:43.061
-I'll be in diagnostics.
-Where were you?

54:43.238 --> 54:45.001
They're pulling the drives apart.

54:45.140 --> 54:47.574
-John Levin called.
-John Levin with Sematach?

54:47.742 --> 54:48.902
He said it's important.

54:49.411 --> 54:53.245
-Why didn't they come this morning?
-Susan called about the benefit.

54:53.415 --> 54:56.077
-Call her and say--
-She said don't try to cancel.

54:56.251 --> 55:00.085
-The Lewyns paid for the tickets.
-I'll be there at 7:30.

55:00.255 --> 55:02.314
Ask her to bring me
a shirt and jacket.

55:03.425 --> 55:04.756
Is everything okay?

55:04.926 --> 55:07.588
Everything is fine, thanks for asking.

55:10.932 --> 55:12.524
I'll kill Arthur.

55:12.667 --> 55:16.535
We must solve this before Friday
and you just got the drives?!

55:16.671 --> 55:18.662
What is Arthur doing over there?

55:18.940 --> 55:22.103
All he does anymore is give
macadamia nuts to people.

55:22.277 --> 55:24.541
Is he a manager or a stewardess?

55:25.680 --> 55:28.342
-He gave you nuts?
-What's slowing it down?

55:28.950 --> 55:30.349
Over here.

55:30.552 --> 55:32.179
Let me show you something.

55:32.954 --> 55:34.615
Arthur was right.

55:34.789 --> 55:37.849
There's a compatibility problem
with the controller chip.

55:38.059 --> 55:39.287
Is it a bug?

55:39.461 --> 55:42.555
Don Cherry debugged Arcamax.
There are no bugs.

55:42.697 --> 55:44.460
Fabrication problem?

55:45.200 --> 55:46.360
What're you doing?

55:46.868 --> 55:51.134
This is a sophisticated piece of
electronics, not a pickup truck.

55:51.306 --> 55:54.867
How bad is it? We have 4,000
of these. Should I junk them all?

55:55.577 --> 56:00.480
I told Arthur to send 10 in heat-sealed
plastic bags. It's a hunch I have.

56:00.649 --> 56:03.209
Do what you can.
I don't understand it.

56:03.385 --> 56:07.651
In prototypes, no problem.
In manufacturing, it falls apart.

56:07.822 --> 56:11.383
Mr. Garvin wants to see you.
He said not to tell anyone.

56:12.994 --> 56:14.985
Catherine Alvarez on two.

56:15.330 --> 56:17.491
Thanks. Could you close the door?

56:31.179 --> 56:32.612
How are you?

56:33.014 --> 56:37.178
Let's agree to mediate.
I don't want this getting out either.

56:52.200 --> 56:55.863
If we get this all over in a week,
my wife needn't know.

57:02.210 --> 57:06.772
I do not want to tell my wife. I don't
want to upset her if I don't have to.

57:23.965 --> 57:25.227
Wait a second.

57:41.683 --> 57:43.310
Guess what?

57:44.085 --> 57:47.248
They locked me out of my computer
and cleaned out my files.

57:48.823 --> 57:50.586
I guess it's starting.

57:55.263 --> 57:56.594
Come in.

57:56.765 --> 57:57.823
I'm not interrupting?

57:57.999 --> 57:59.694
No, not at all.

58:12.514 --> 58:13.947
Going down?

58:16.518 --> 58:19.112
Don't tell me you're scared of me.

58:27.862 --> 58:29.625
I don't want it to be this way.

58:29.798 --> 58:32.232
Yeah, we could be fucking right now.

58:32.367 --> 58:35.359
-I think of you as a friend.
-Oh, come off it!

58:35.537 --> 58:36.469
You called Blackburn--

58:36.638 --> 58:39.539
Only to beat you to the punch.
I knew you'd play that card.

58:39.741 --> 58:42.869
I wasn't playing a card.
You were the one that--

58:43.044 --> 58:44.739
Alarm.

58:48.149 --> 58:49.810
This isn't a game.

58:50.051 --> 58:53.646
You'd have a great job, the spin-off
would make you a millionaire.

58:53.822 --> 58:56.256
We'd have fun.
It's not like breaking rocks.

58:56.558 --> 58:58.048
You don't get it.

58:59.060 --> 59:02.826
Poor Sanders. You have no
idea what you're up against.

59:03.331 --> 59:04.662
As usual.

59:05.166 --> 59:07.896
By this time tomorrow you'll
wish you took the Austin job.

59:08.269 --> 59:09.497
We'll see.

59:10.171 --> 59:11.604
We'll see.

59:13.575 --> 59:17.272
I'm trying to figure out whether
to get a fat Barbie for Eliza.

59:17.412 --> 59:19.573
Mattel makes a fat Barbie?

59:19.781 --> 59:22.011
It's called ''Happy to Be Me Barbie.''

59:22.183 --> 59:25.175
Does she come with the
''Happy to Be Divorced Ken''?

59:25.353 --> 59:27.014
I'm serious.

59:27.188 --> 59:28.917
Which is more stigmatizing?

59:29.090 --> 59:31.422
Yeah, Barbie's stigmatized.

59:31.593 --> 59:35.427
It's that whole male,
36-24-36 image of beauty.

59:35.597 --> 59:37.292
Women are oppressed.

59:37.432 --> 59:39.195
Women are oppressed?!

59:39.367 --> 59:44.270
80% of suicides are committed by men.
They're dropping from heart attacks.

59:44.439 --> 59:47.203
-You're not as tough.
-Sorry. We're just fighting the wars.

59:47.442 --> 59:49.103
You start the wars.

59:49.310 --> 59:52.541
I'm sorry. I don't have
my own crisis hot line.

59:52.947 --> 59:56.815
-You're taking the Meredith thing well.
-That has nothing to do with it.

59:56.951 --> 59:59.886
What was today's rumor?
She was once a man?

01:00:00.054 --> 01:00:01.214
Just tell her.

01:00:01.389 --> 01:00:02.720
Tell her what?

01:00:02.891 --> 01:00:05.826
Tell her a lot of us have
worked as hard as you...

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:09.953
...and you're blowing this merger
for all of us because you fucked up.

01:00:11.966 --> 01:00:13.058
What happened?

01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:16.903
Who got to you?

01:00:17.405 --> 01:00:18.736
It's not that simple.

01:00:18.907 --> 01:00:23.344
The thought of losing millions happens
to stick right here in my throat.

01:00:23.478 --> 01:00:27.642
This was my big shot. It's not
like I'm being scouted by the NBA.

01:00:27.849 --> 01:00:29.407
What happened?

01:00:29.918 --> 01:00:34.150
Who knows? An old girlfriend, a
bottle of wine, a late meeting...

01:00:34.322 --> 01:00:35.983
-Fill in the blanks.
-Thanks.

01:00:36.658 --> 01:00:41.595
You're like women who think they're in
the hotel room, drunk, to watch TV.

01:00:41.763 --> 01:00:44.357
Could you possibly be more lame?

01:00:44.499 --> 01:00:47.366
For your information, Mark,
Tom told me everything.

01:00:48.102 --> 01:00:50.093
Everything that happened.

01:00:50.672 --> 01:00:52.663
And I support him 100%.

01:00:53.107 --> 01:00:55.268
That is so sweet, but I don't think--

01:00:55.443 --> 01:00:56.933
Let's not discuss it.

01:00:58.012 --> 01:00:59.877
Let's just enjoy the evening.

01:01:12.527 --> 01:01:15.018
Obviously, something happened.

01:01:15.396 --> 01:01:16.886
Did you have sex?

01:01:17.031 --> 01:01:19.966
-Think first. Because if you're lying--
-No, I said, no.

01:01:20.134 --> 01:01:25.037
She kissed me, and she unzipped
my pants, and-and-and-and-and--

01:01:25.206 --> 01:01:25.900
And?

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:27.701
And that was it.

01:01:27.909 --> 01:01:29.536
How did it get that far?

01:01:29.711 --> 01:01:32.805
-You think I encouraged her?
-Her hand was in your pants?

01:01:32.981 --> 01:01:35.040
-Nothing happened.
-How did that happen?

01:01:35.216 --> 01:01:37.707
Then she accuses me of
sexual harassment--

01:01:37.919 --> 01:01:39.546
-She harassed you?
-You don't believe me?

01:01:39.721 --> 01:01:41.313
Mark doesn't believe you.

01:01:41.489 --> 01:01:44.481
He's got stock options on the brain.
He's back-stabbing.

01:01:44.659 --> 01:01:47.492
Everybody's sure you're
having an affair with Cindy.

01:01:47.662 --> 01:01:50.927
-We're not having an affair.
-How could you let this happen?

01:01:51.065 --> 01:01:53.659
-Nothing happened.
-Something happened.

01:01:56.237 --> 01:01:58.330
She's an old girlfriend of yours.

01:01:58.573 --> 01:02:02.441
Like I'm surprised. That club's
as exclusive as the white pages.

01:02:08.583 --> 01:02:12.019
-I was going to tell you.
-I can't believe everyone knew but me.

01:02:12.186 --> 01:02:16.020
-Nobody knows it.
-You're so naive. Of course they know.

01:02:17.759 --> 01:02:20.751
I'm old-fashioned. I greet my
inferiors with a handshake.

01:02:20.962 --> 01:02:22.190
I'll handle it.

01:02:22.363 --> 01:02:23.455
Jesus.

01:02:26.034 --> 01:02:27.592
What does she look like?

01:02:28.269 --> 01:02:29.964
She's attractive.

01:02:30.271 --> 01:02:31.966
One to ten.

01:02:32.373 --> 01:02:33.465
Eight.

01:02:35.209 --> 01:02:36.198
Nine.

01:02:38.613 --> 01:02:40.604
What does the company say?

01:02:40.782 --> 01:02:44.047
They want me to transfer to
Austin, do some therapy.

01:02:44.218 --> 01:02:45.480
Austin?

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:47.119
I'm not moving there.

01:02:47.288 --> 01:02:49.119
We're not moving to Austin.

01:02:49.557 --> 01:02:51.491
-I'm pressing charges.
-For what?

01:02:51.626 --> 01:02:54.789
Sexual harassment.
We have a mediation tomorrow.

01:02:54.996 --> 01:02:56.987
When were you going to tell me?

01:02:57.298 --> 01:03:01.064
That's brilliant.
Show up without your wife.

01:03:01.302 --> 01:03:04.237
-I'll handle it.
-Are you crazy? They'll destroy you.

01:03:04.405 --> 01:03:07.067
-It won't go that far.
-It'll take over our life.

01:03:07.241 --> 01:03:11.735
Depositions and whispering and legal
fees for some damn personal vindication.

01:03:11.913 --> 01:03:16.247
And all people remember is that
you were involved in something sleazy.

01:03:17.752 --> 01:03:19.310
-Do you have a lawyer?
-Catherine Alvarez.

01:03:19.387 --> 01:03:21.617
Great. When are we on Hard Copy?

01:03:22.156 --> 01:03:24.147
But if it had happened to you--

01:03:24.325 --> 01:03:26.520
You know how many times
it's happened to me?

01:03:26.661 --> 01:03:29.755
-You never said this ever happened--
-You're so narcissistic.

01:03:29.931 --> 01:03:32.024
Nothing happens until
it happens to you.

01:03:32.166 --> 01:03:35.761
-You should've said something.
-I do what women always do.

01:03:35.937 --> 01:03:40.169
I deal with it. Now go in
there tomorrow and work it out.

01:03:40.341 --> 01:03:42.935
Right. I should shut up and fuck her.

01:03:43.111 --> 01:03:45.341
Apologize and get your job back.

01:03:45.546 --> 01:03:47.104
Apologize?!

01:03:47.281 --> 01:03:49.272
The children are sleeping.

01:03:50.051 --> 01:03:53.680
Wait, I got a better idea.
Why don't I just admit it?

01:03:53.855 --> 01:03:58.622
I'll be the evil male you all complain
about. Then I can fuck everybody.

01:03:58.793 --> 01:04:00.192
Tom, stop it.

01:04:00.361 --> 01:04:02.295
Come, I want to dominate you!

01:04:02.463 --> 01:04:03.293
You're scaring her.

01:04:03.464 --> 01:04:04.624
I have a urge!

01:04:04.799 --> 01:04:05.561
The children!

01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:09.363
My children that I
provide for and protect.

01:04:09.637 --> 01:04:14.074
They can come between me and my
wife, move us, take my job...

01:04:14.308 --> 01:04:16.299
...and take the house we have made! ! !

01:04:16.477 --> 01:04:18.877
And I apologize to them, Susan?

01:04:19.814 --> 01:04:23.477
They call me a rapist and I
apologize. This is a joke.

01:04:24.986 --> 01:04:28.217
Sexual harassment is about power.

01:04:29.157 --> 01:04:31.717
When did I have the power?

01:04:32.727 --> 01:04:33.716
When?

01:05:42.597 --> 01:05:44.690
Good morning, I'm Judge Murphy.

01:05:44.866 --> 01:05:47.027
This is a mediation.

01:05:47.201 --> 01:05:52.104
Our proceedings are confidential.
Maintain a civil and courteous tone.

01:05:52.273 --> 01:05:55.208
Our goal is to determine
the nature of the dispute...

01:05:55.376 --> 01:05:58.038
...and how best to resolve it.

01:05:58.379 --> 01:06:01.712
The parties have agreed that
Mr. Sanders will speak first...

01:06:01.883 --> 01:06:04.283
...and be cross-examined
by Mr. Heller.

01:06:04.452 --> 01:06:08.445
Ms. Johnson will speak next, and
be cross-examined by Ms. Alvarez.

01:06:08.623 --> 01:06:09.954
Any questions?

01:06:10.391 --> 01:06:11.722
Let's get started.

01:06:11.959 --> 01:06:15.451
I had my cellular phone with me,
so when she called Garvin...

01:06:15.630 --> 01:06:20.226
...I called Mark Lewyn to give
him the upshot of our meeting.

01:06:20.468 --> 01:06:21.901
Then she approached you?

01:06:22.136 --> 01:06:25.799
Correct. She took the phone
from me and she kissed me.

01:06:25.973 --> 01:06:26.735
Where?

01:06:28.075 --> 01:06:29.906
She kissed me in my ear...

01:06:30.745 --> 01:06:31.803
...on my neck...

01:06:31.979 --> 01:06:33.412
...on my mouth.

01:06:33.814 --> 01:06:35.975
She put her tongue in my mouth.

01:06:36.317 --> 01:06:38.649
When you asked her to stop, did she?

01:06:39.487 --> 01:06:41.079
No, no.

01:06:41.422 --> 01:06:43.322
She unzipped my pants...

01:06:43.491 --> 01:06:45.482
...and massaged my penis.

01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:47.651
-Were you aroused?
-Yes.

01:06:47.995 --> 01:06:49.326
Then she slid down...

01:06:49.997 --> 01:06:51.089
...and she...

01:06:51.432 --> 01:06:53.161
...put my penis in her mouth.

01:06:53.334 --> 01:06:54.926
Did you climax?

01:06:55.336 --> 01:06:59.102
I grabbed her by the wrists.
I threw her on the ground.

01:06:59.273 --> 01:07:01.264
Then I wanted to leave.

01:07:01.442 --> 01:07:03.672
Then what did Ms. Johnson do?

01:07:03.945 --> 01:07:05.503
She threatened me.

01:07:05.846 --> 01:07:07.780
She said, ''You're dead.''

01:07:08.449 --> 01:07:12.010
And then, the next day,
Mr. Blackburn told me that...

01:07:12.186 --> 01:07:16.179
...she said that I had
sexually harassed her.

01:07:19.126 --> 01:07:20.024
Mr. Heller?

01:07:20.194 --> 01:07:23.288
-Mr. Sanders, would you like a break?
-No, I'm fine.

01:07:23.464 --> 01:07:27.127
You say the bottle of wine
was Ms. Johnson's idea?

01:07:27.301 --> 01:07:28.359
Yes.

01:07:28.536 --> 01:07:32.370
But when you were living
with Ms. Johnson...

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:36.974
...didn't you discover wines together
on trips to the Napa Valley?

01:07:37.144 --> 01:07:38.133
Yes.

01:07:38.312 --> 01:07:39.643
Romantic trips?

01:07:40.715 --> 01:07:41.545
Yes.

01:07:41.716 --> 01:07:45.311
But you didn't expect any
romance in her office?

01:07:46.153 --> 01:07:49.486
Did you have a conversation
after lunch about how...

01:07:49.724 --> 01:07:52.318
...seeing Meredith gave you a...

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:53.720
...boner?

01:07:55.229 --> 01:07:56.890
Someone else said that.

01:07:57.064 --> 01:08:00.056
lsn't the term ''boner''
a slang for erection?

01:08:00.501 --> 01:08:02.492
You had a conversation about...

01:08:03.404 --> 01:08:05.668
...having an erection? A boner?

01:08:06.107 --> 01:08:07.699
Yes, but I didn't say it.

01:08:08.242 --> 01:08:09.732
But you laughed.

01:08:10.244 --> 01:08:11.404
Yes.

01:08:11.579 --> 01:08:13.069
So you condone it.

01:08:13.914 --> 01:08:15.575
It was harmless.

01:08:15.850 --> 01:08:17.340
If it's harmless...

01:08:18.185 --> 01:08:19.913
...why are we here today?

01:08:20.587 --> 01:08:22.522
Well, it was just...

01:08:22.923 --> 01:08:24.515
...what guys talk about.

01:08:24.692 --> 01:08:26.182
About their boners?

01:08:26.594 --> 01:08:28.084
Not generally, no.

01:08:28.261 --> 01:08:32.926
Yet you expect us to believe that
after having a sexual conversation...

01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:35.193
...you weren't thinking of sex?

01:08:35.368 --> 01:08:36.529
That's correct.

01:08:37.203 --> 01:08:42.107
How would you characterize your
prior relationship with Ms. Johnson?

01:08:42.443 --> 01:08:43.876
Highly sexual?

01:08:44.278 --> 01:08:45.939
I don't know how to rate it.

01:08:47.048 --> 01:08:48.379
Every day?

01:08:48.616 --> 01:08:51.380
Sometimes twice a day.
Sex in public places.

01:08:51.551 --> 01:08:52.541
Sodomy.

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:53.948
Viewing of pornography.

01:08:54.788 --> 01:08:57.451
Vibrators and
other mechanical devices.

01:08:58.792 --> 01:09:01.785
Sometimes we sat on the
couch and watched television.

01:09:02.296 --> 01:09:07.233
But when you became reacquainted, you
no longer saw her as a sexual object?

01:09:07.401 --> 01:09:09.961
-She was just your boss now?
-That's correct.

01:09:10.638 --> 01:09:14.130
And do you admit having an
erection during your meeting?

01:09:14.575 --> 01:09:18.978
She had her top open.
It was an involuntary reflex.

01:09:19.145 --> 01:09:20.477
Reflex.

01:09:21.482 --> 01:09:26.145
Do you think her gynecologist gets an
erection when he examines her breast?

01:09:26.319 --> 01:09:28.082
That's completely different.

01:09:28.255 --> 01:09:30.917
Do you admit putting
your penis in her mouth?

01:09:31.658 --> 01:09:32.648
She did.

01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:34.658
Oh, I forgot.

01:09:35.496 --> 01:09:36.986
You resisted.

01:09:38.432 --> 01:09:43.095
Mr. Sanders, during your
rather fantastic testimony...

01:09:43.270 --> 01:09:46.433
...there was one moment
that rang true.

01:09:47.274 --> 01:09:49.104
You said, and I quote:

01:09:49.276 --> 01:09:50.675
''I was angry.

01:09:50.944 --> 01:09:53.505
I felt I was being pushed around.''

01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:54.511
Correct.

01:09:54.682 --> 01:09:57.116
The truth is,
you felt that way all day.

01:09:57.451 --> 01:10:01.945
You'd been expecting a promotion and
she got it. You got angry about it.

01:10:02.123 --> 01:10:03.954
I felt I deserved the job.

01:10:04.125 --> 01:10:06.787
You took that anger up to her office.

01:10:06.961 --> 01:10:08.792
You'd show her who's boss.

01:10:08.963 --> 01:10:10.191
That's not true.

01:10:10.698 --> 01:10:14.862
Did you tell your wife about your
7 o'clock meeting with Ms. Johnson?

01:10:15.035 --> 01:10:17.367
I had a meeting and I'd be home late.

01:10:17.638 --> 01:10:19.037
You expected to be late?

01:10:19.707 --> 01:10:23.643
No, but if I got home earlier my
wife would be pleasantly surprised.

01:10:24.311 --> 01:10:27.144
So you make it a rule
to lie to your wife?

01:10:27.314 --> 01:10:28.645
I didn't lie.

01:10:28.816 --> 01:10:31.808
When you called your wife,
did you tell her that...

01:10:31.986 --> 01:10:34.887
...Ms. Johnson was a
former lover of yours?

01:10:35.723 --> 01:10:38.556
When you got home, did you
tell her what happened?

01:10:39.994 --> 01:10:42.224
No, I hoped it would go away.

01:10:42.396 --> 01:10:45.058
You hoped you'd get away with it?

01:10:45.833 --> 01:10:50.236
Do not debunk the illusion that this
dispute might be settled amicably.

01:10:50.471 --> 01:10:51.495
That's okay.

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:54.501
I have no further questions.

01:10:59.013 --> 01:11:02.676
I asked to see pictures.
I thought if we put it on that basis...

01:11:02.850 --> 01:11:05.842
...it would be clear that
things had changed between us.

01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:07.578
Do you have those pictures now?

01:11:07.755 --> 01:11:09.916
I'd like copies for my file.

01:11:10.191 --> 01:11:11.681
You can continue.

01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:17.196
He said his wife hadn't lost all
the weight gained from pregnancy.

01:11:17.364 --> 01:11:19.264
His children were beautiful...

01:11:19.867 --> 01:11:21.528
...but they made him feel old...

01:11:21.702 --> 01:11:25.604
...and seeing me reminded him of
what it was like to be young...

01:11:25.773 --> 01:11:28.105
...and marriage was a tough trade-off.

01:11:28.275 --> 01:11:29.264
Go on.

01:11:30.544 --> 01:11:33.775
My assistant, Mrs. Ross,
asked if she could go home.

01:11:33.948 --> 01:11:36.041
I wanted her to stay, but felt guilty.

01:11:36.217 --> 01:11:39.209
I'd kept her late for weeks
preparing for my new job.

01:11:39.553 --> 01:11:42.044
And where was Mr. Sanders
at that point?

01:11:42.223 --> 01:11:44.623
He began to rub my shoulders.

01:11:46.794 --> 01:11:48.125
And you let him?

01:11:49.063 --> 01:11:50.724
It was awkward...

01:11:50.898 --> 01:11:54.231
...but I thought we'd end the
meeting and leave it at that.

01:11:54.401 --> 01:11:56.232
Then he tried to kiss you?

01:11:56.403 --> 01:12:00.066
No, Mr. Garvin called and
then I came back to Tom...

01:12:00.241 --> 01:12:03.802
...and said that was it, and
then he began to kiss me.

01:12:03.978 --> 01:12:05.309
Did you try to stop him?

01:12:05.479 --> 01:12:10.143
Yes. I struggled with him and
told him to stop. But he didn't.

01:12:11.585 --> 01:12:13.644
Did he attack you physically?

01:12:17.091 --> 01:12:18.080
Yes.

01:12:18.759 --> 01:12:21.091
He grabbed me by my hair...

01:12:21.929 --> 01:12:24.921
...and forced me down on my knees.

01:12:26.667 --> 01:12:27.998
And...

01:12:29.770 --> 01:12:31.328
He put his...

01:12:31.505 --> 01:12:33.336
...penis in your mouth?

01:12:37.111 --> 01:12:39.272
This is making me uncomfortable.

01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:40.840
Want some water?

01:12:49.290 --> 01:12:50.348
Thank you.

01:12:58.299 --> 01:13:01.132
He put his penis in my mouth...

01:13:02.202 --> 01:13:04.864
...and said that he was going to...

01:13:05.472 --> 01:13:08.373
To fuck you? Were those his words?

01:13:09.310 --> 01:13:11.642
He said, ''Do you want to get fucked?''

01:13:11.812 --> 01:13:14.542
And then he reached down
and tore off my panties.

01:13:15.816 --> 01:13:17.716
What did you do then?

01:13:19.219 --> 01:13:22.552
He threw me down on the scaffold
and I kneed him in the groin.

01:13:22.723 --> 01:13:24.486
And that was the end of it?

01:13:25.159 --> 01:13:29.892
It's strange. I'd think my instinct
would be to run, but I became angry.

01:13:30.064 --> 01:13:33.727
I yelled at him. Called him names.
Told him I'd kill him.

01:13:33.901 --> 01:13:35.391
Just yelling.

01:13:35.903 --> 01:13:37.837
How did he react?

01:13:38.005 --> 01:13:42.237
He seemed to realize what he'd done.
He pulled up his pants and left.

01:13:43.844 --> 01:13:46.335
Did you call anyone afterwards?

01:13:47.748 --> 01:13:48.737
No.

01:13:48.916 --> 01:13:50.679
I didn't know what to do.

01:13:51.852 --> 01:13:55.185
I kept going over the day in my
mind trying to figure out...

01:13:55.356 --> 01:13:58.018
...if somehow this thing was my fault.

01:14:00.527 --> 01:14:02.188
You reported it the next day?

01:14:03.197 --> 01:14:04.255
Yes.

01:14:05.532 --> 01:14:08.695
But you didn't bring
formal charges. Why not?

01:14:10.604 --> 01:14:12.367
I talked to Phil Blackburn.

01:14:12.539 --> 01:14:14.598
I knew he was Tom's friend.

01:14:14.775 --> 01:14:16.766
I didn't want to destroy...

01:14:16.944 --> 01:14:20.937
...Tom's marriage or career, but it's
clear we couldn't work together.

01:14:21.281 --> 01:14:23.272
I would be too scared.

01:14:23.717 --> 01:14:25.708
I'm scared just sitting here.

01:14:30.391 --> 01:14:31.790
Nothing further.

01:14:32.292 --> 01:14:33.384
Ms. Alvarez.

01:14:34.895 --> 01:14:38.626
Ms. Johnson, I just want
to be clear on one thing.

01:14:38.966 --> 01:14:42.458
Mr. Sanders suggested
the bottle of wine?

01:14:42.636 --> 01:14:44.797
-That's right.
-But you bought it.

01:14:44.972 --> 01:14:47.736
I sent my assistant Mrs. Ross
out to buy a bottle.

01:14:47.908 --> 01:14:49.398
That afternoon?

01:14:49.977 --> 01:14:51.808
Did you tell her what kind?

01:14:52.312 --> 01:14:56.078
I said to get a nice Chardonnay.
I knew Tom liked white wine.

01:14:56.250 --> 01:15:00.152
From those trips to Napa that
he was an amateur connoisseur.

01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:02.413
He'd be impressed by a nice bottle.

01:15:02.589 --> 01:15:03.578
Yes.

01:15:03.757 --> 01:15:05.418
Do you remember the wine?

01:15:05.826 --> 01:15:06.656
No.

01:15:07.494 --> 01:15:09.428
The '91 Pahlmeyer?

01:15:10.664 --> 01:15:11.756
That's right.

01:15:11.932 --> 01:15:14.662
Do you know where your
assistant got that wine?

01:15:15.502 --> 01:15:18.164
I assume she got it at a liquor store.

01:15:18.439 --> 01:15:20.270
Would it surprise you to know...

01:15:20.441 --> 01:15:23.672
...that no liquor store in
Seattle carries that bottle?

01:15:25.779 --> 01:15:27.610
Mrs. Ross is very resourceful.

01:15:27.848 --> 01:15:29.281
Very resourceful?

01:15:29.450 --> 01:15:33.284
A bottle of wine you can't find
within 500 miles of Seattle.

01:15:35.022 --> 01:15:38.014
I have no idea where she
got the bottle of wine.

01:15:38.625 --> 01:15:43.119
lsn't it true, Ms. Johnson, that
you told Mrs. Ross 3 weeks ago...

01:15:43.297 --> 01:15:46.789
...that you wanted a
bottle of '91 Pahlmeyer...

01:15:46.967 --> 01:15:48.628
...for this meeting?

01:15:48.802 --> 01:15:50.133
That's not true.

01:15:50.304 --> 01:15:53.137
And when she couldn't
find it, you said--.

01:15:53.974 --> 01:15:56.966
What was that? It had
such managerial brio.

01:15:57.211 --> 01:15:58.701
Here it is.

01:15:59.146 --> 01:16:01.706
''If you don't find the wine...

01:16:01.882 --> 01:16:03.975
...find a replacement.''

01:16:04.151 --> 01:16:06.813
Do you have testimony
from Mrs. Ross?

01:16:06.987 --> 01:16:08.147
Yes, I do.

01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:11.150
Ms. Johnson?

01:16:11.725 --> 01:16:15.161
The fact is Mrs. Ross
has personal problems.

01:16:15.395 --> 01:16:17.158
She has a drinking problem.

01:16:17.331 --> 01:16:20.664
She makes up stories to make
herself seem more important.

01:16:20.901 --> 01:16:24.393
I told Mrs. Ross to go buy a bottle
of wine after Tom and I spoke...

01:16:24.571 --> 01:16:26.334
...at the luncheon.

01:16:26.507 --> 01:16:28.907
Maybe she had that bottle at home.

01:16:29.743 --> 01:16:31.574
Maybe in her wine cellar.

01:16:34.581 --> 01:16:35.843
Any more questions?

01:16:36.016 --> 01:16:37.745
No, not for now.

01:16:40.254 --> 01:16:42.745
I think this is a good time
for a break.

01:16:43.357 --> 01:16:48.090
I got some information on Meredith.
You won't believe it, or maybe you will.

01:16:48.428 --> 01:16:51.192
Alan gave me a list, we
can't verify any of this.

01:16:51.365 --> 01:16:53.925
-You said you didn't have sex.
-I didn't.

01:16:54.101 --> 01:16:55.932
I didn't have sex with her.

01:16:56.103 --> 01:16:58.867
What is it, Tom?
She's trying to quit smoking?

01:16:59.039 --> 01:17:01.200
-It's true.
-How could you do this?

01:17:01.375 --> 01:17:03.036
She did it. That's the point.

01:17:03.210 --> 01:17:04.871
You saw this woman alone.

01:17:05.045 --> 01:17:09.277
You had wine, a back rub, you kissed.
And then this non-sex sex thing.

01:17:09.449 --> 01:17:11.940
You took off her panties.
Those are facts.

01:17:12.119 --> 01:17:13.211
So what?

01:17:13.387 --> 01:17:17.221
-That doesn't happen unless you want it.
-I was cornered.

01:17:17.391 --> 01:17:19.552
-You let it happen!
-I did not!

01:17:19.726 --> 01:17:23.218
How could you? How could you
let that woman into our lives?

01:17:24.398 --> 01:17:25.729
Get this.

01:17:25.899 --> 01:17:30.233
Ten of her subordinates transferred
in the last 5 years. All men.

01:17:30.404 --> 01:17:31.564
What a red flag!

01:17:31.738 --> 01:17:32.727
Can you see them?

01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:37.133
Yeah, but no one will talk and we can't
subpoena them just for a mediation.

01:17:39.980 --> 01:17:43.074
-Do you want to have lunch?
-I must go back to work.

01:17:45.118 --> 01:17:47.450
How about you? Are you hungry?

01:17:51.658 --> 01:17:53.421
How are you holding up?

01:17:53.827 --> 01:17:55.260
Are you married?

01:17:55.429 --> 01:17:57.420
Chandler, Hogue and Alvarez.

01:17:57.598 --> 01:18:00.260
-I married Chandler.
-You married your boss?

01:18:00.434 --> 01:18:04.427
Classic case of sexual harassment. He
asked me out 5 times before I said yes.

01:18:04.605 --> 01:18:08.166
Today, if I had said no once, he
would have been afraid to ask again.

01:18:09.176 --> 01:18:10.939
Tom said you're a lawyer.

01:18:11.111 --> 01:18:12.442
Ten years.

01:18:12.613 --> 01:18:16.515
-Let's switch hats. What do you think?
-I don't look good in hats.

01:18:16.950 --> 01:18:19.350
You're afraid she's telling the truth.

01:18:20.687 --> 01:18:21.779
Yes.

01:18:22.522 --> 01:18:25.355
What he did, he did out of weakness.

01:18:25.626 --> 01:18:27.617
Hardly makes it better, does it?

01:18:27.861 --> 01:18:31.854
I can't get in the middle of
your relationship with Tom...

01:18:32.032 --> 01:18:36.128
...but she did break the law
and that makes the difference.

01:18:36.303 --> 01:18:41.206
Ms. Alvarez, 48 hrs ago, my husband's
penis was in another woman's mouth.

01:18:41.541 --> 01:18:45.204
There's nothing in the law
that'll help me deal with that.

01:18:50.317 --> 01:18:51.978
When did these arrive?

01:18:52.152 --> 01:18:53.983
Came in an hour ago.

01:18:54.988 --> 01:18:59.891
Garvin had me send the Corridor to the
hotel for the Conley people to use.

01:19:00.227 --> 01:19:01.319
It's at the hotel?

01:19:01.495 --> 01:19:04.828
Yeah. The Conley people had
such fun with it yesterday...

01:19:04.998 --> 01:19:07.728
Getting anywhere with the drives?
I'm counting on you.

01:19:07.901 --> 01:19:10.165
-I have a hunch.
-What is it?

01:19:10.337 --> 01:19:12.066
-I don't know.
-What is it?

01:19:12.239 --> 01:19:13.729
I don't know.

01:19:16.243 --> 01:19:18.234
She got to you, didn't she?

01:19:19.913 --> 01:19:24.350
What else? They're stronger, they're
smarter and they don't fight fair.

01:19:24.518 --> 01:19:27.248
It's the next step in
the human evolution.

01:19:27.421 --> 01:19:30.185
Keep some of us for
sperm and kill the rest.

01:19:30.357 --> 01:19:31.415
What do you have?

01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:37.196
If I know something for a fact,
I won't withhold it.

01:19:37.364 --> 01:19:40.595
But I can't go out on a limb,
it's too intense around here.

01:19:41.935 --> 01:19:46.702
I'm 23. I can't wake up tomorrow and
find I'm out of the computer business.

01:19:55.215 --> 01:19:56.944
Why aren't you at the mediation?

01:19:57.117 --> 01:20:01.713
I just came back to--. This was
the last thing I needed this week.

01:20:01.888 --> 01:20:02.877
Come in.

01:20:05.892 --> 01:20:07.951
Something's come up.

01:20:08.128 --> 01:20:11.222
I need to know exactly
what happened that night.

01:20:11.398 --> 01:20:14.060
Well, it's exactly like I told Phil.

01:20:14.801 --> 01:20:16.735
You're not talking to Phil.

01:20:18.138 --> 01:20:23.075
We have Sanders' phone records. It's
possible someone overheard you two.

01:20:33.253 --> 01:20:34.982
John Levin called again.

01:20:35.422 --> 01:20:37.481
Find out what it's about.

01:20:37.657 --> 01:20:39.989
He must talk to you personally.

01:20:41.161 --> 01:20:42.992
I don't want to talk to him now.

01:20:45.265 --> 01:20:46.664
Can I talk to you?

01:20:50.337 --> 01:20:51.429
Cindy...

01:20:52.172 --> 01:20:53.764
Are you ''a friend''?

01:20:56.276 --> 01:20:57.436
A friend?

01:20:58.445 --> 01:20:59.673
You know...

01:21:00.113 --> 01:21:02.343
...''a friend.'' A friend.

01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:06.183
I depends on what you
mean by ''a friend.''

01:21:10.457 --> 01:21:11.788
All right, never mind.

01:21:45.826 --> 01:21:48.226
He's heading for the elevator.

01:22:04.911 --> 01:22:07.072
Heading back to the mediation?

01:22:07.247 --> 01:22:10.011
-Yeah, I must get back.
-I'll give you a lift.

01:22:11.418 --> 01:22:14.080
Don't you think it's time we talked?

01:22:22.395 --> 01:22:26.058
I understand you both had a
chance to get it off your chest.

01:22:26.233 --> 01:22:29.066
Your version of what happened.
Now I want it to stop.

01:22:29.236 --> 01:22:32.069
What I got off my chest
was not a version.

01:22:32.372 --> 01:22:36.274
It's always a version. That's
the legacy of the modern age.

01:22:36.443 --> 01:22:40.777
We have information but no truth.
Flashes of electrons in a grain of sand.

01:22:40.947 --> 01:22:42.539
I'm telling the truth.

01:22:43.116 --> 01:22:46.552
-You must look at this from all sides.
-How many sides are there?

01:22:47.621 --> 01:22:50.715
All right, let's say she
made a mistake. So what?

01:22:50.891 --> 01:22:53.052
She made a pass, that's all.

01:22:53.226 --> 01:22:56.787
You could have decided
it was flattering.

01:22:56.963 --> 01:23:00.956
You could have handled it many
ways, but this vindictiveness...

01:23:01.134 --> 01:23:02.726
...I must say, I'm surprised.

01:23:02.903 --> 01:23:04.734
It's against the law.

01:23:04.905 --> 01:23:06.236
I work for her.
I'm employed by her.

01:23:06.740 --> 01:23:08.139
No. You work for me.

01:23:08.308 --> 01:23:10.242
That's what I'm saying.

01:23:10.410 --> 01:23:15.313
After all these years, why didn't you
come to me? Not hire this lawyer!

01:23:15.482 --> 01:23:16.813
Maybe I should have.

01:23:16.983 --> 01:23:19.645
I mean, why can't you just forget it?

01:23:19.819 --> 01:23:23.585
Work together like adults and
everyone makes a pile of money.

01:23:23.757 --> 01:23:26.248
-What's wrong with that?
-It's gone too far.

01:23:26.426 --> 01:23:28.485
Things can go back.

01:23:29.963 --> 01:23:32.022
Why would he offer to settle now?

01:23:32.232 --> 01:23:34.462
He realized how much they got to lose.

01:23:34.634 --> 01:23:36.625
No, it doesn't add up.

01:23:36.803 --> 01:23:39.966
Maybe there's a vulnerability
we don't know about.

01:23:40.740 --> 01:23:45.143
I'm still getting messages from
''a friend''. I printed out the address.

01:23:45.312 --> 01:23:47.371
Maybe you can check it out.

01:23:48.481 --> 01:23:52.474
I hope DigiCom doesn't find him first.
Remember the cleaning lady?

01:23:52.652 --> 01:23:56.053
She's out of town. No one knows
where or when she's coming back.

01:23:56.256 --> 01:23:59.555
The Bahamas, probably, with
Mrs. Ross soon to join her.

01:23:59.759 --> 01:24:01.818
These guys play hardball.

01:24:52.212 --> 01:24:56.706
Did Mr. Sanders ever touch you in a way
that makes you feel uncomfortable?

01:24:56.883 --> 01:24:58.373
He's not aware of it.

01:24:58.551 --> 01:25:00.712
Just answer the question, please.

01:25:01.454 --> 01:25:02.386
Yes.

01:25:02.555 --> 01:25:03.715
How?

01:25:04.824 --> 01:25:06.951
He'll pat me on my behind or...

01:25:07.127 --> 01:25:08.890
...rub my shoulders.

01:25:09.062 --> 01:25:10.393
Rub your shoulders?

01:25:10.897 --> 01:25:13.058
I don't think he means
anything by it.

01:25:13.233 --> 01:25:14.461
You don't like it.

01:25:15.468 --> 01:25:17.629
I just feel it's inappropriate.

01:25:17.971 --> 01:25:19.905
I don't see the relevance of this.

01:25:20.073 --> 01:25:22.906
We're trying to establish
a pattern of behavior.

01:25:23.076 --> 01:25:26.068
Sexual harassers generally
follow a pattern.

01:25:26.346 --> 01:25:27.472
I'll allow it.

01:25:29.349 --> 01:25:31.340
Do you have chiropractic problems?

01:25:31.651 --> 01:25:34.745
Any neck problems, or your back?

01:25:34.921 --> 01:25:35.910
No.

01:25:36.156 --> 01:25:39.990
So you would characterize
this behavior as flirting...

01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:41.488
...or sexual?

01:25:43.163 --> 01:25:45.859
-I suppose so.
-But you never said anything.

01:25:46.266 --> 01:25:47.358
He's my boss.

01:25:47.767 --> 01:25:49.166
You didn't report it?

01:25:50.670 --> 01:25:52.763
He's your boss. I understand.

01:25:52.939 --> 01:25:55.169
Your job is at stake. Rumors.

01:25:55.375 --> 01:25:57.366
Whether people would believe you.

01:25:57.677 --> 01:26:02.614
And if I ask you if you ever had any
sexual relations with Mr. Sanders...

01:26:02.782 --> 01:26:03.942
...same answer?

01:26:04.884 --> 01:26:05.942
No, I didn't.

01:26:06.186 --> 01:26:07.175
Didn't report it?

01:26:07.821 --> 01:26:10.312
-It never happened.
-I understand.

01:26:10.757 --> 01:26:12.657
I have no more questions.

01:26:13.827 --> 01:26:15.055
Barbara called...

01:26:15.295 --> 01:26:18.492
-about the Disneyland tickets for...?
-Jafar.

01:26:18.665 --> 01:26:22.157
He's got the tickets and
an upgrade at the hotel.

01:26:22.335 --> 01:26:24.269
Thank you, I appreciate it.

01:26:26.339 --> 01:26:27.670
They gave me your photos.

01:26:32.445 --> 01:26:33.776
I'll see you later?

01:26:34.013 --> 01:26:35.446
Yes, I'll see you later.

01:27:15.655 --> 01:27:16.553
You know...

01:27:16.723 --> 01:27:19.715
...it's funny how you always
assumed you'd get the job.

01:27:19.893 --> 01:27:22.054
Lewyn assumed
it would be him or you.

01:27:22.829 --> 01:27:26.993
But nobody ever thought for
a second it might be me.

01:27:27.167 --> 01:27:28.498
lsn't that funny?

01:27:30.403 --> 01:27:32.496
That's not true. You were on the list.

01:27:32.672 --> 01:27:33.730
Really?

01:27:33.907 --> 01:27:37.900
Let me guess: ''Hunter, not
someone you'd follow into battle.

01:27:38.344 --> 01:27:41.006
A team player. No killer instinct.

01:27:41.181 --> 01:27:43.081
Doesn't have those tools.''

01:27:43.249 --> 01:27:45.240
What is that all a code for?

01:27:45.418 --> 01:27:47.511
What, you on Meredith's side?

01:27:49.689 --> 01:27:52.681
I studied engineering for eight years.

01:27:52.859 --> 01:27:56.522
I was the only woman in the
department. You know what I did?

01:27:56.863 --> 01:27:59.696
I worked. You think
I'm on Meredith's side?

01:28:04.437 --> 01:28:06.200
What do you want to do?

01:28:07.207 --> 01:28:08.196
What?

01:28:08.775 --> 01:28:12.939
Their offer ends midnight. It's what
Garvin said. You get your job back.

01:28:13.112 --> 01:28:16.946
She's your boss.
Everyone goes back to work.

01:28:18.718 --> 01:28:20.049
Did you find ''a friend''?

01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:22.120
Did we get the address?

01:28:22.288 --> 01:28:26.452
Dr. Arthur Friend, a chemistry professor
from the University of Washington...

01:28:26.626 --> 01:28:29.459
...who's been in Nepal
the last three weeks.

01:28:29.629 --> 01:28:31.961
You got messages from
a locked office.

01:28:32.799 --> 01:28:35.063
I'm glad we got that one solved.

01:28:35.568 --> 01:28:37.729
Shit, I have to call Lewyn.

01:28:38.404 --> 01:28:41.305
The drives we're having
problems with came in.

01:28:41.474 --> 01:28:42.805
Only you.

01:28:43.643 --> 01:28:48.137
Anyone else would be sabotaging the
company, not solving their problems.

01:28:48.314 --> 01:28:49.804
It's Adele and Mark.

01:28:49.983 --> 01:28:53.475
We're not home, leave a message
and we'll call you back.

01:28:56.489 --> 01:28:57.319
What?

01:28:58.258 --> 01:29:03.093
Mark's wife's voice is on the machine,
but on Monday it was a man's voice.

01:29:04.330 --> 01:29:07.493
Then the next day Mark said
he never got the message.

01:29:13.506 --> 01:29:15.838
I dialed the wrong number that night.

01:29:16.776 --> 01:29:17.936
So?

01:29:20.780 --> 01:29:23.112
That's why the battery was dead.

01:29:23.283 --> 01:29:25.183
What are you talking about?

01:29:30.957 --> 01:29:34.358
That's why Garvin wants to deal.
He's got my phone records.

01:29:34.627 --> 01:29:37.960
I've got a 10 minute phone bill
while I'm in Meredith's office.

01:29:38.131 --> 01:29:41.862
She took the phone away.
I called the wrong number...

01:29:42.035 --> 01:29:45.368
...but I never hung up the phone.
The phone line is open.

01:29:47.373 --> 01:29:50.137
Somebody's got this whole
thing on an answering machine.

01:29:59.052 --> 01:30:01.316
It's Levin, not Lewyn.

01:30:03.156 --> 01:30:04.316
What's going on?

01:30:04.557 --> 01:30:08.493
I've been getting phone calls.
Some creep has my Visa...

01:30:08.661 --> 01:30:12.392
...then, at the office,
everything's turned upside down.

01:30:12.565 --> 01:30:14.157
Have they got the tape?

01:30:14.334 --> 01:30:17.565
What I'm saying is, it's
good I brought it home.

01:30:17.737 --> 01:30:21.173
-My girlfriend and I listened to it.
-Where's the tape?

01:30:23.743 --> 01:30:25.074
It's all here?

01:30:26.245 --> 01:30:30.011
I've been trying to get
a hold of you all week!

01:30:30.183 --> 01:30:31.741
You know what this means?

01:30:32.085 --> 01:30:34.747
Do you have any idea
what this means?

01:30:35.355 --> 01:30:36.845
Thanks, pal.

01:30:49.102 --> 01:30:51.593
No deal. No, no deal, Catherine.

01:30:51.771 --> 01:30:55.104
We're going to bury them.
Everything is on tape.

01:30:55.441 --> 01:30:57.102
Yes, everything.

01:31:29.609 --> 01:31:30.837
Put it in.

01:31:35.348 --> 01:31:37.009
God, look at us.

01:31:37.517 --> 01:31:39.280
Go inside me.

01:31:41.220 --> 01:31:42.346
I can't do this.

01:31:42.522 --> 01:31:44.217
-Do it.
-I won't.

01:31:44.357 --> 01:31:46.450
Now! Come on, now!

01:31:47.126 --> 01:31:49.617
You can't just stop! You can't!

01:31:50.029 --> 01:31:51.360
No! Goddamn it!

01:32:01.808 --> 01:32:05.471
You stick your dick in my mouth
then get an attack of morality?

01:32:08.381 --> 01:32:10.315
This never happened.

01:32:11.384 --> 01:32:13.375
You never used to be this way.

01:32:15.755 --> 01:32:19.316
In any judicial proceeding,
this tape would be inadmissible.

01:32:19.492 --> 01:32:23.553
I'm worried I'm going to drive to
work and hear it on Howard Stern.

01:32:23.763 --> 01:32:24.889
Is she threatening?

01:32:25.064 --> 01:32:27.828
I don't know how many copies
of this tape there are.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.332
I didn't put it out there.

01:32:31.337 --> 01:32:35.171
This tape just shows consensual
sex between adults...

01:32:35.908 --> 01:32:38.570
...however it may have
appeared the next day.

01:32:38.778 --> 01:32:41.770
Mr. Sanders' regret is not
my client's harassment.

01:32:42.181 --> 01:32:44.775
Ms. Johnson,
is that your position today?

01:32:45.284 --> 01:32:46.273
Yes, it is.

01:32:47.286 --> 01:32:48.412
Ms. Alvarez?

01:32:48.855 --> 01:32:52.586
Just so I'm clear on
what today's story is...

01:32:52.792 --> 01:32:55.920
...would you define for
me ''consensual sex.''

01:32:56.095 --> 01:32:59.189
Sex where both parties
are willing participants.

01:32:59.532 --> 01:33:02.797
How many times did we hear
Mr. Sanders say ''no''?

01:33:03.436 --> 01:33:06.872
I don't know, I was busy listening
to my panties being torn off.

01:33:07.206 --> 01:33:08.298
31.

01:33:08.441 --> 01:33:09.931
31 times.

01:33:10.109 --> 01:33:11.804
Doesn't ''no'' mean ''no''?

01:33:12.545 --> 01:33:16.879
Sometimes ''no'' means that person
wants to be overwhelmed, dominated.

01:33:17.049 --> 01:33:21.452
The way we're supposed to have sex
nowadays we'd need UN supervision.

01:33:21.621 --> 01:33:23.384
''No'' means ''no.''

01:33:23.890 --> 01:33:25.949
lsn't that what we tell women?

01:33:26.325 --> 01:33:28.316
Do men deserve less?

01:33:29.228 --> 01:33:32.959
When he really wanted to stop
he had no problems doing it.

01:33:33.132 --> 01:33:34.463
And you got angry.

01:33:34.634 --> 01:33:36.625
Of course I did. Anyone would.

01:33:36.836 --> 01:33:39.327
We tell women they
can stop at any point.

01:33:39.472 --> 01:33:42.066
Haven't you ever said
''no'' and meant ''yes''?

01:33:42.241 --> 01:33:44.573
Until the moment of penetration--

01:33:44.744 --> 01:33:47.645
He was willing. That tape
doesn't change anything.

01:33:47.847 --> 01:33:52.750
You controlled the meeting. You
set the time, you ordered the wine.

01:33:52.919 --> 01:33:56.912
You demanded service and got
angry when he didn't provide it.

01:33:57.089 --> 01:34:01.423
So you decided to get rid of
him with this trumped-up charge.

01:34:01.594 --> 01:34:05.496
The only thing you have proven
is that a woman in power...

01:34:05.665 --> 01:34:08.429
...can be every bit
as abusive as a man.

01:34:08.601 --> 01:34:12.264
You want to put me on trial?
Let's be honest about why.

01:34:12.438 --> 01:34:14.872
I am sexually aggressive. I like it.

01:34:15.007 --> 01:34:17.168
Tom knew it and you can't handle it.

01:34:17.376 --> 01:34:20.106
It's the same thing since
the beginning of time.

01:34:20.279 --> 01:34:23.373
Veil it, hide it, lock it
up and throw away the key.

01:34:23.516 --> 01:34:26.280
We expect a woman to do a man's
job, make a man's money...

01:34:26.452 --> 01:34:30.388
...then lie down for a man to fuck
her like it was 100 years ago!

01:34:30.523 --> 01:34:32.184
Well, no, thank you.

01:34:39.031 --> 01:34:43.968
You won't believe this. I think
the Howard Stern thing got to them.

01:34:44.203 --> 01:34:46.467
-What did Phil say?
-You get your job back.

01:34:46.639 --> 01:34:50.131
You get $100,000 in pain and suffering,
and I get fees and expenses.

01:34:50.710 --> 01:34:51.540
Meredith?

01:34:51.711 --> 01:34:54.305
She stays through the merger,
then they say...

01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:58.541
...she has to leave for some
whatever emergency. She's out.

01:34:58.718 --> 01:35:01.482
This is total and
complete vindication.

01:35:02.421 --> 01:35:03.979
It's over!

01:35:10.830 --> 01:35:15.062
I almost feel sorry for him.
He has no idea, does he?

01:35:23.676 --> 01:35:28.340
I'd like to read this over again before
we sign. Not that I don't trust you.

01:35:28.514 --> 01:35:31.449
Just as long as it's done
by midnight tonight.

01:35:31.584 --> 01:35:34.075
Garvin wants this off his screen.

01:35:37.523 --> 01:35:40.253
We want you to make a
presentation on Arcamax...

01:35:40.459 --> 01:35:42.950
...at the merger announcement
tomorrow.

01:35:43.129 --> 01:35:45.188
Nothing technical, 4 minutes.

01:35:45.364 --> 01:35:46.353
Fine.

01:35:46.532 --> 01:35:47.521
Great.

01:35:47.867 --> 01:35:51.769
Now I've got to go break it to her.
It won't be easy.

01:35:51.971 --> 01:35:54.599
I thought you enjoyed
that kind of thing.

01:35:54.774 --> 01:35:58.175
You go after one of our people,
we'll put the wagons in a circle.

01:35:58.344 --> 01:36:02.337
Once you made your case,
the company behaved appropriately.

01:36:02.515 --> 01:36:03.504
Right?

01:36:03.683 --> 01:36:06.243
-You don't want to know what I think.
-It's terrible.

01:36:06.419 --> 01:36:09.183
Way a thing like this can...

01:36:09.355 --> 01:36:10.913
...tear a company apart.

01:36:11.090 --> 01:36:14.423
I told Bob we really need
to take a look at it.

01:36:16.028 --> 01:36:17.017
Friends?

01:36:19.865 --> 01:36:20.763
What?

01:36:21.100 --> 01:36:24.263
I hope you still think
of me as a friend.

01:36:26.105 --> 01:36:27.436
Good night, Phil.

01:36:31.043 --> 01:36:33.273
Sign it now and I'll read it later.

01:36:34.046 --> 01:36:35.377
Where will you be?

01:36:35.548 --> 01:36:38.039
Here, working on the presentation.

01:36:38.217 --> 01:36:41.709
If not, I'll have somebody
run this by your house later.

01:36:49.295 --> 01:36:51.058
Let me ask you something.

01:36:51.797 --> 01:36:53.287
Why'd she do this?

01:36:53.733 --> 01:36:57.635
You've seen her in action.
She's cool, smart and in control.

01:36:57.803 --> 01:37:01.068
-How'd she lose control like this?
-I don't know.

01:37:01.307 --> 01:37:03.400
You're attractive. Maybe.

01:37:03.576 --> 01:37:07.478
-But not irresistible.
-I'm serious. She's here one day.

01:37:07.646 --> 01:37:10.740
There's a merger going on.
Conley people are touchy.

01:37:10.916 --> 01:37:12.474
She thought you'd go along.

01:37:12.651 --> 01:37:14.642
-There's more to it than that.
-Come on.

01:37:14.820 --> 01:37:17.653
You think too much.
You need to go home...

01:37:17.823 --> 01:37:20.257
...open a nice bottle of champagne...

01:37:20.426 --> 01:37:23.589
...make up with your
wife and get some sleep.

01:37:23.763 --> 01:37:25.162
It's over.

01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:29.062
Thank you.

01:37:29.201 --> 01:37:31.567
Absolutely. You're welcome.

01:37:32.138 --> 01:37:33.298
Good night.

01:37:33.472 --> 01:37:34.564
Good night.

01:38:04.003 --> 01:38:05.231
Hi, Stephanie.

01:38:05.404 --> 01:38:09.238
Must be difficult, nobody
giving you information.

01:38:09.408 --> 01:38:10.841
It's been a crazy week.

01:38:11.410 --> 01:38:15.403
I had a friend. She was one of
the first women to move high up.

01:38:15.748 --> 01:38:19.343
You know what it's like,
every day putting out fires.

01:38:19.618 --> 01:38:22.246
It turned out the job
wasn't what she thought.

01:38:22.421 --> 01:38:25.254
She was looking the wrong
way when they fired her.

01:38:26.125 --> 01:38:27.422
lnteresting.

01:38:27.693 --> 01:38:30.685
Truth usually is, once you get to it.

01:38:48.647 --> 01:38:49.944
It's you.

01:38:50.282 --> 01:38:51.271
Where is everyone?

01:38:51.450 --> 01:38:55.216
Mr. Garvin came in an hour ago.
Said they were working too hard.

01:38:55.387 --> 01:38:56.877
Sent everyone home.

01:39:57.516 --> 01:40:00.007
-What if Sanders doesn't bring it up?
-He will.

01:40:00.219 --> 01:40:03.211
I talked to him about his
presentation on Arcamax.

01:40:03.355 --> 01:40:04.845
He has no idea.

01:40:05.024 --> 01:40:06.719
When he brings up the line....

01:40:06.859 --> 01:40:09.623
You must pounce because we
don't have the harassment.

01:40:09.795 --> 01:40:12.787
It must be that Sanders
is incompetent.

01:40:14.033 --> 01:40:16.627
It'll be in public. With reporters.

01:40:16.969 --> 01:40:18.732
Bob's counting on you.

01:40:19.038 --> 01:40:21.370
Let's clean out the database.

01:40:21.540 --> 01:40:22.871
And any backup.

01:40:28.881 --> 01:40:31.543
Catherine,
can you hold on one minute?

01:40:38.157 --> 01:40:40.751
Has my contract gone out already?

01:40:40.893 --> 01:40:42.258
Shit.

01:40:42.828 --> 01:40:45.319
What does it say about firing me?

01:40:45.497 --> 01:40:48.557
They can fire me for cause,
can't they? For incompetence?

01:40:49.501 --> 01:40:53.562
The problem with the drives is not
with the programming or the design.

01:40:53.772 --> 01:40:57.401
It's with the production line
and that's my responsibility.

01:40:57.843 --> 01:40:59.572
This whole thing tomorrow...

01:40:59.912 --> 01:41:01.777
...they're setting me up.

01:42:12.751 --> 01:42:14.742
Housekeeping, please.

01:42:16.355 --> 01:42:18.255
This is Mr. Conley.

01:42:18.424 --> 01:42:21.086
Could someone come
and turn down my bed?

01:42:21.593 --> 01:42:25.256
My room number? It's on
the phone here somewhere....

01:42:26.665 --> 01:42:27.859
That's right.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:29.763
Thank you very much.

01:42:36.508 --> 01:42:40.774
-When does your dad arrive?
-Midnight. They stopped in Houston.

01:42:40.946 --> 01:42:43.779
I'd love for him to get a
chance to see the Corridor.

01:42:44.283 --> 01:42:45.375
You know...

01:42:45.784 --> 01:42:50.278
I stayed up late last night, fooling
around with it up in my room.

01:42:50.689 --> 01:42:52.179
It's really incredible.

01:42:58.697 --> 01:43:00.392
I'm sorry, sir.

01:43:00.532 --> 01:43:02.022
Here, thank you.

01:43:02.201 --> 01:43:03.634
-You're welcome.
-Good night.

01:43:03.802 --> 01:43:05.394
Have a nice evening.

01:44:22.981 --> 01:44:27.111
You're in the Corridor, our prototype
for a virtual reality database.

01:44:27.286 --> 01:44:29.277
Enjoy the demonstration.

01:44:29.488 --> 01:44:34.391
lnformation accessed during this demo
is for entertainment value only...

01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:37.723
...and should not be duplicated
to another database.

01:44:37.896 --> 01:44:41.297
If you have any questions,
ask the angel.

01:45:32.851 --> 01:45:35.342
Malaysian Operations.

01:46:14.493 --> 01:46:17.826
Searching Malaysian revisions file.

01:46:18.497 --> 01:46:20.897
Why don't we go up to my suite?

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.992
Give my colleagues a chance
to try out the Corridor.

01:46:25.837 --> 01:46:27.327
Good idea.

01:46:54.533 --> 01:46:57.934
''Reduction of air handling
capacity from number 7 air handlers...

01:46:58.136 --> 01:47:01.128
...to a more appropriate
and cost-effective number 5.''

01:47:01.540 --> 01:47:06.034
You can't put number 5 handlers in
there. You'll have dirt in everything.

01:47:09.214 --> 01:47:11.205
My God, she's in the system.

01:47:29.801 --> 01:47:31.666
Angel, I need help.

01:47:33.905 --> 01:47:35.167
Help is here.

01:47:35.807 --> 01:47:38.571
Can I stop files from being deleted?

01:47:38.744 --> 01:47:40.803
I'm sorry. You're not Level 5.

01:47:45.751 --> 01:47:48.413
You're supposed to protect the files.

01:47:48.587 --> 01:47:51.488
Sysop controls are
restricted to Level 5.

01:48:11.943 --> 01:48:14.434
Show me all communications
with Malaysia.

01:48:14.713 --> 01:48:16.442
Telephone or video?

01:48:16.782 --> 01:48:18.010
Video.

01:48:30.028 --> 01:48:33.964
Show me the last transmission
involving Meredith.

01:48:40.305 --> 01:48:44.298
Sooner or later, Tom will figure
out the changes at the plant.

01:48:44.476 --> 01:48:45.534
He's not stupid.

01:48:45.744 --> 01:48:48.372
Tom will be out of the picture
by Tuesday.

01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:52.816
I don't like to gamble.
I love Tahoe, but I think the risk--

01:48:52.984 --> 01:48:56.545
Think. Who'll believe him?
He's married, with a family.

01:48:56.755 --> 01:48:59.815
He'll have no choice but to
take the settlement and leave.

01:48:59.991 --> 01:49:03.893
Then we say Sanders made the changes
at the plant? He'll deny it.

01:49:04.062 --> 01:49:06.758
He won't know.
He'll be gone by then.

01:49:29.521 --> 01:49:32.183
These things are so darn complicated.

01:49:35.794 --> 01:49:37.284
I think it's upside down.

01:49:49.207 --> 01:49:50.538
There we go.

01:50:02.554 --> 01:50:03.543
Who's first?

01:50:04.122 --> 01:50:06.215
Must have left the system on.

01:50:08.393 --> 01:50:10.623
Give it a try. You'll love it.

01:50:10.829 --> 01:50:12.729
I'd love to try it.

01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:24.333
I am totally screwed.

01:50:25.243 --> 01:50:27.143
I'll make my presentation...

01:50:27.345 --> 01:50:29.905
...Meredith will ask me questions.

01:50:30.081 --> 01:50:32.242
She'll make me
look totally incompetent.

01:50:32.417 --> 01:50:35.250
Are you sure there's not
another system somewhere?

01:50:35.420 --> 01:50:38.082
The system
has been completely deleted.

01:50:38.256 --> 01:50:39.985
So I'm a sitting duck.

01:50:40.492 --> 01:50:44.155
I'll be walking around like
a ghost with a resume.

01:51:08.687 --> 01:51:10.018
It's Mohammed Jafar.

01:51:10.188 --> 01:51:11.519
How are you?

01:51:11.690 --> 01:51:15.285
I don't mean to bug you,
but we're departing Monday--

01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:19.794
It's my fault. Susan got the
Disneyland tickets for you.

01:51:20.031 --> 01:51:21.123
The E-tickets?

01:51:21.299 --> 01:51:25.395
You're comped for all the rides and
at the hotel they'll upgrade you.

01:51:25.537 --> 01:51:28.131
Magnificent. I can't
wait to tell my wife.

01:51:28.306 --> 01:51:31.969
She said you were full of shit.
You know how women are.

01:51:32.143 --> 01:51:34.043
Yes, I sure do.

01:51:34.479 --> 01:51:36.310
I miss your face.

01:51:36.548 --> 01:51:40.541
Talk to Arthur. He sees it
enough on the DVL. I'm always--

01:51:45.924 --> 01:51:47.323
Tom, are you there?

01:51:47.492 --> 01:51:51.929
Mohammed, on this end,
we back up our files on DAT.

01:51:52.063 --> 01:51:54.327
Do you do the same over there?

01:51:54.666 --> 01:51:56.566
I don't know what we have.

01:51:57.335 --> 01:51:59.826
I'd have to check it out. Why?

01:52:00.005 --> 01:52:03.839
I got a real problem here.
I'm up against the wall and...

01:52:04.576 --> 01:52:07.511
...I need you to do some
things for me, Mohammed.

01:52:08.747 --> 01:52:11.011
I hope we have what you need, Tom.

01:52:40.478 --> 01:52:41.604
Daddy?

01:52:42.480 --> 01:52:44.971
I never believed what
they said about you.

01:52:50.488 --> 01:52:51.978
Thank you, honey.

01:52:53.091 --> 01:52:54.991
Come here, big guy.

01:53:03.802 --> 01:53:05.133
Thank you.

01:53:21.653 --> 01:53:23.018
Those from Malaysia?

01:53:23.521 --> 01:53:26.581
I can't believe it's still coming out.
It started at 7.

01:53:48.780 --> 01:53:50.042
Testing.

01:54:08.366 --> 01:54:10.300
Put these in one of the files.

01:54:35.994 --> 01:54:38.656
Yeah, there's a real talent to fishing.

01:54:40.098 --> 01:54:42.589
First you must choose the right bait...

01:54:42.734 --> 01:54:45.225
...then you must know
when to reel it in.

01:54:46.104 --> 01:54:48.504
About the other day, I didn't mean...

01:54:48.673 --> 01:54:49.833
Yes, you did.

01:54:50.608 --> 01:54:52.838
I apologize, and...

01:54:53.011 --> 01:54:54.171
...thank you.

01:54:55.513 --> 01:54:56.844
I accept.

01:55:04.422 --> 01:55:07.118
Which brings us to our
Advanced Products Group.

01:55:07.258 --> 01:55:10.022
Tom Sanders heads our
manufacturing department.

01:55:10.195 --> 01:55:12.026
Tom, can you come up here...

01:55:12.197 --> 01:55:16.361
...and review for us the revolutionary
new product we call Arcamax?

01:55:24.876 --> 01:55:26.639
Thank you, Meredith.

01:55:29.547 --> 01:55:33.449
Arcamax is our own stand-alone
CD-ROM drive player.

01:55:34.052 --> 01:55:37.783
Now, for a CD-ROM drive to be
effective, it must be portable...

01:55:38.056 --> 01:55:39.546
...it has to be fast.

01:55:39.724 --> 01:55:44.457
Arcamax is twice as fast as any
CD-ROM drive in the world today.

01:55:45.063 --> 01:55:48.396
We've had our problems,
but we are solving them.

01:55:48.566 --> 01:55:51.228
And were the problems
with the design?

01:55:51.402 --> 01:55:55.395
No, there are fabrication problems
involving the production line.

01:55:55.573 --> 01:55:56.972
What sort of problems?

01:55:57.675 --> 01:56:01.907
For example, we should be using
automatic chip installers to lock...

01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:03.911
...the control chip on.

01:56:04.082 --> 01:56:06.744
The Malaysians have been
doing it by hand...

01:56:06.918 --> 01:56:09.409
...jamming the chips
in with their thumbs.

01:56:09.587 --> 01:56:12.078
And the quality of the air is dirty.

01:56:12.257 --> 01:56:16.250
We should use level 7 air
handlers, we're using level 5.

01:56:16.427 --> 01:56:19.191
And we're ordering our
components, like...

01:56:19.330 --> 01:56:23.699
...hinge rods and clips, not
from our Singapore supplier...

01:56:23.835 --> 01:56:27.999
...but from someone who's a lot
cheaper but also less reliable.

01:56:28.206 --> 01:56:32.609
I'm confused. You set up this line.
You didn't anticipate these problems?

01:56:33.611 --> 01:56:37.775
The line was changed.
The specifications were altered.

01:56:38.116 --> 01:56:41.517
How is that possible? We know
you to be a competent manager.

01:56:43.521 --> 01:56:47.287
You should know.
You ordered the changes.

01:56:48.293 --> 01:56:50.523
I don't know how you got that idea.

01:56:51.029 --> 01:56:53.293
You were in Kuala Lumpur last year.

01:56:55.033 --> 01:56:59.129
To settle a labor dispute.
I've never even seen the line.

01:57:01.739 --> 01:57:02.967
You haven't?

01:57:03.308 --> 01:57:05.640
No, I don't know who told you I--

01:57:10.448 --> 01:57:12.882
You're watching Malaysian Channel 3.

01:57:19.257 --> 01:57:21.987
Perhaps instead of digging
up Malaysian video clips...

01:57:22.160 --> 01:57:24.651
...we should discuss
the problems here...

01:57:24.829 --> 01:57:27.821
...the problems in your department
with the line you set up.

01:57:28.900 --> 01:57:30.162
All right.

01:57:35.773 --> 01:57:40.506
The 1st memo in the file being handed
out is signed by Meredith Johnson.

01:57:40.678 --> 01:57:44.671
It states that manual labor will
be used to install the chips.

01:57:44.849 --> 01:57:47.409
That made the Malay
government happy.

01:57:47.852 --> 01:57:51.288
It also meant voltage irregularities
and memory allocation--

01:57:51.422 --> 01:57:54.414
The Malay government
insisted we fill those jobs.

01:57:54.592 --> 01:57:58.926
The Malaysian government does
not own shares of DigiCom.

01:57:59.097 --> 01:58:00.928
These people here do.

01:58:02.867 --> 01:58:04.528
The second memo...

01:58:04.702 --> 01:58:08.604
...reduces the air handling
capacity in order to cut costs.

01:58:08.940 --> 01:58:13.877
And that's why we're getting dirt in
the split optics, the drive arms.

01:58:14.112 --> 01:58:19.049
The resulting delays will actually
increase the costs by more than 70%.

01:58:19.317 --> 01:58:23.378
-The third memo regarding--
-The drives are your responsibility!

01:58:24.622 --> 01:58:27.147
These problems were created
because of your incompetence.

01:58:27.759 --> 01:58:29.317
That's what's wrong!

01:58:29.460 --> 01:58:31.451
Passing the buck!
Back stabbing!

01:58:31.629 --> 01:58:32.618
I'm not done.

01:58:32.830 --> 01:58:35.628
This so-called evidence of
yours is fooling no one!

01:58:35.833 --> 01:58:39.894
You can protect your turf
and think it means something.

01:58:40.071 --> 01:58:43.404
You weren't told of these decisions
because they're over your head.

01:58:43.574 --> 01:58:45.906
This merger is about synergy...

01:58:46.077 --> 01:58:49.569
...between hardware and software,
between cash flow and capital needs.

01:58:49.747 --> 01:58:52.079
That's a language
you can't understand!

01:58:52.250 --> 01:58:53.581
I don't either.

01:58:54.419 --> 01:58:57.411
We're buying this company
because they build things.

01:58:58.156 --> 01:59:00.420
You understand what she means?

01:59:07.999 --> 01:59:11.765
I'm trying to convey the
sentiments of everyone here.

01:59:11.936 --> 01:59:13.767
That's what I meant to do.

01:59:18.676 --> 01:59:21.270
Could you step outside
for a moment?

01:59:32.957 --> 01:59:35.289
Can you build the darn thing or not?

01:59:36.194 --> 01:59:37.889
Yes, sir, we can.

01:59:40.698 --> 01:59:44.395
They're replacing Meredith.
Garvin's announcing it in 10 minutes.

01:59:47.305 --> 01:59:48.636
Ten minutes?

02:00:12.563 --> 02:00:14.724
I'm surprised you didn't come to gloat.

02:00:14.932 --> 02:00:19.665
Gloating is underrated. I actually
came here to pick up the Arcamax files.

02:00:19.837 --> 02:00:21.930
Some smart people underrated you.

02:00:22.173 --> 02:00:23.572
Thank you.

02:00:24.242 --> 02:00:25.834
Not including myself.

02:00:26.010 --> 02:00:29.002
I beat you. I beat you fair and square.

02:00:29.514 --> 02:00:31.448
Garvin lost his nerve.

02:00:31.582 --> 02:00:34.847
It was his brilliant idea to
fire you for incompetence.

02:00:35.086 --> 02:00:36.519
Him and Phil.

02:00:36.687 --> 02:00:38.177
Now I'm being fired.

02:00:39.257 --> 02:00:43.751
I've never seen you play the victim.
It's the only good quality you had.

02:00:44.095 --> 02:00:48.259
I'm playing the game men set up,
and I'm being punished for it.

02:00:48.766 --> 02:00:50.199
It's fine.

02:00:50.535 --> 02:00:54.528
I've had calls from ten
head-hunters with job offers.

02:00:55.873 --> 02:00:59.468
Don't be surprised if I'm back
in ten years to buy this place.

02:01:01.546 --> 02:01:06.108
Did it ever occur to you, Meredith,
that maybe I set you up?

02:01:21.566 --> 02:01:24.228
-This is my son, Spencer.
-How you doing?

02:01:24.402 --> 02:01:26.563
-Good.
-You're at the University of Washington?

02:01:26.737 --> 02:01:28.796
That's great. Very good.

02:01:46.090 --> 02:01:47.580
What a week!

02:01:47.758 --> 02:01:49.419
The Chinese say:

02:01:49.927 --> 02:01:53.328
''May you live in interesting times.''

02:01:55.099 --> 02:01:59.433
This merger is the most
interesting merger I've had...

02:01:59.770 --> 02:02:01.328
...since my 2nd marriage.

02:02:02.940 --> 02:02:04.931
The merger is complete.

02:02:05.543 --> 02:02:07.534
The question now is...

02:02:08.179 --> 02:02:12.343
...who do we find to run
things up here in Seattle?

02:02:12.550 --> 02:02:15.041
And what I realized during this...

02:02:15.186 --> 02:02:17.450
...very interesting week...

02:02:17.955 --> 02:02:21.288
...is that I have probably
focused too much on...

02:02:21.459 --> 02:02:25.623
...breaking the glass ceiling,
finding a woman to run things here...

02:02:25.796 --> 02:02:29.562
...when I should have been
looking for the best person...

02:02:29.800 --> 02:02:31.461
...to run things here.

02:02:32.203 --> 02:02:33.568
Someone whose...

02:02:33.704 --> 02:02:38.300
...long service with this company
has established a record...

02:02:38.643 --> 02:02:40.133
...of creativity...

02:02:40.311 --> 02:02:41.972
...sound judgement...

02:02:42.213 --> 02:02:44.579
...and hands-on expertise.

02:02:45.650 --> 02:02:47.311
And that person...

02:02:48.219 --> 02:02:49.982
...is Stephanie Kaplan.

02:02:56.494 --> 02:02:58.724
Congratulations, Stephanie.

02:03:09.907 --> 02:03:12.842
I tell you something,
she's the greatest!

02:03:14.512 --> 02:03:16.173
Thank you.

02:03:16.681 --> 02:03:20.913
First, I'd like to take the opportunity
to thank the department heads:

02:03:21.252 --> 02:03:24.119
...Mary Anne Hunter
and Mark Lewyn here...

02:03:24.255 --> 02:03:27.247
...and Don Cherry, where are you?

02:03:28.125 --> 02:03:29.422
There he is.

02:03:29.627 --> 02:03:32.118
And particularly, Tom Sanders...

02:03:32.263 --> 02:03:35.926
...who epitomizes the
inventiveness of this division...

02:03:36.133 --> 02:03:37.691
...its past and its future.

02:03:38.536 --> 02:03:41.198
I'm counting on you to be
my right-hand.

02:03:42.540 --> 02:03:43.871
Thank you.

02:03:50.681 --> 02:03:53.912
We are heading
into a new millennium...

02:03:54.185 --> 02:03:55.243
...a new time.

02:03:56.020 --> 02:03:58.079
You a chemistry major, Spencer?

02:03:59.924 --> 02:04:01.084
Yeah, I am.

02:04:03.094 --> 02:04:07.360
I know a chemistry professor there,
Arthur Friend. A. Friend.

02:04:08.032 --> 02:04:10.262
I don't know if he teaches freshmen.

02:04:10.434 --> 02:04:12.197
I'm his research assistant.

02:04:13.270 --> 02:04:16.262
So if Arthur Friend was
in Nepal, for example...

02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:20.103
...you'd have the keys to his
office and computer password.

02:04:25.549 --> 02:04:28.780
We all work so well together
and it's exciting...

02:04:28.953 --> 02:04:30.944
...and it's wonderful to see.

02:04:32.289 --> 02:04:33.722
Thank you.

02:04:35.292 --> 02:04:37.453
Your mother's
an extraordinary woman.

02:04:37.728 --> 02:04:39.457
You just figured that out?
