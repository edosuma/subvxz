<i>Previously on</i> The Affair...

00:08.083 --> 00:09.515
What's going on?

00:09.551 --> 00:10.717
Did something happen?
Did he do something?

00:10.719 --> 00:13.136
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't be here.

00:13.188 --> 00:15.121
- I should be going.
- Hey, stop, don't...

00:19.060 --> 00:20.059
- You fucked her, didn't you?
- This is not...

00:20.111 --> 00:21.110
Cole!

00:24.633 --> 00:25.932
<i>What is it you do, Alison?</i>

00:25.967 --> 00:29.502
Uh, at the moment, just this.

00:29.537 --> 00:31.337
<i>Did you ever
think about leaving?</i>

00:31.348 --> 00:32.915
<i>Yeah.</i>

00:32.917 --> 00:34.783
When I was younger,
I wanted to be a doctor.

00:34.785 --> 00:36.219
You did?

00:36.221 --> 00:37.786
Hey, hey, hey!
Here he is!

00:37.788 --> 00:41.057
The new bad boy
of American letters.

00:41.059 --> 00:44.260
<i>Some people calling you
the voice of your generation.</i>

00:44.262 --> 00:46.062
There's a guest bedroom
upstairs at the end of the hall.

00:46.064 --> 00:48.497
Come meet me there
in 15 minutes.

00:53.269 --> 00:55.504
- Dad, what the fuck?
- Oh, shit!

00:55.506 --> 00:57.006
Did you manage to get
a hold of him?

00:57.008 --> 00:59.141
Service is out everywhere
with the hurricane.

00:59.143 --> 01:00.342
Let's focus on you
and that baby.

01:00.344 --> 01:01.577
I can't do this alone.

01:01.579 --> 01:02.645
I can't do...

01:02.647 --> 01:04.747
Your husband is finally here.

01:04.748 --> 01:06.214
Should I show him in?

01:06.216 --> 01:08.951
Not yet.

Holy crap.

02:42.910 --> 02:45.711
They said this was
gonna be a circus,

02:45.713 --> 02:47.113
but this... you know what,
fuck the construction.

02:47.115 --> 02:48.047
Go around the back.

02:50.416 --> 02:52.451
It's fine.
Just pull up here.

02:52.453 --> 02:54.286
- Noah.
- Are you sure?

02:54.288 --> 02:56.355
I'm good.

02:56.357 --> 02:59.091
All right, then.

02:59.093 --> 03:01.527
Here we go.
Stick right behind me.

03:01.529 --> 03:03.327
Don't talk to anyone,
don't look at anyone.

03:22.815 --> 03:24.816
Excuse us,
excuse us.

03:24.818 --> 03:25.850
Please, please back up.

03:25.852 --> 03:27.218
Are you expecting...

03:27.220 --> 03:28.986
- ...a quick trial?
- Please, not now.

03:28.988 --> 03:30.054
Jury's three quarters female.
Is that a good thing?

03:30.056 --> 03:31.155
No questions now.

03:31.157 --> 03:32.756
I'm sorry.
Excuse us.

03:32.758 --> 03:35.525
Excuse us, please.

03:35.527 --> 03:36.526
Sign my book.

03:36.528 --> 03:37.527
Excuse me, please.

03:37.529 --> 03:38.762
Fuck you, Solloway.

03:41.933 --> 03:44.969
_

03:46.871 --> 03:50.207
Hey, Ali, uh, just wondering
if you got my texts.

03:50.209 --> 03:53.310
It's, uh, 12 minutes
past two.

03:53.312 --> 03:56.080
So, uh, just checking
you're okay,

03:56.082 --> 03:59.349
and wondering if you want us
to start without you,

03:59.351 --> 04:02.251
or if you, uh, if I should
just... I don't know,

04:02.253 --> 04:05.621
make a run for it
and go see <i>Captain America.</i>

04:05.623 --> 04:08.557
Marilyn's staring at me,
so, uh, help,

04:08.559 --> 04:10.392
she's gonna make me talk.

04:10.394 --> 04:13.329
Uh, uh, love you.

04:15.398 --> 04:16.933
I don't know where she is.

04:16.935 --> 04:19.135
Maybe she's in the subway
or something.

04:19.137 --> 04:21.237
I'm sure she'll turn up.

04:21.238 --> 04:23.239
You seem tired.

04:23.241 --> 04:24.406
Uh, I am.

04:24.408 --> 04:25.975
Baby was up again.

04:25.977 --> 04:27.877
4:50, her time of choice.

04:27.879 --> 04:29.411
That's no fun.

04:29.413 --> 04:31.313
Uh, God, it's abysmal.

04:31.315 --> 04:33.950
You're out cold,
dreaming sweetly,

04:33.952 --> 04:35.752
and this little voice
that's somehow so loud,

04:35.754 --> 04:37.720
"Mama, Mama."

04:37.722 --> 04:40.055
I didn't know she was talking.

04:40.057 --> 04:43.392
Yeah, I can't get her to say
"Dada" to save my life,

04:43.394 --> 04:46.262
but that's okay.
Still love her.

04:46.264 --> 04:47.396
I guess.

04:51.968 --> 04:53.201
Nothing?

04:53.203 --> 04:55.036
No, no.

04:55.038 --> 04:56.472
She has a midterm tomorrow.

04:56.474 --> 04:58.307
She probably stayed
behind after class

04:58.309 --> 05:01.910
and, uh, asked some questions.
Who knows?

05:01.912 --> 05:04.946
Yes, she mentioned last week
that she was nervous about it.

05:04.948 --> 05:06.815
Yeah, I keep telling her
she shouldn't be.

05:06.817 --> 05:09.418
I mean, she... she's gonna be
a great doctor.

05:09.420 --> 05:11.920
I can't understand why
she's so hard on herself.

05:11.922 --> 05:14.156
- She...
- You can't?

05:14.158 --> 05:16.258
Really?

05:20.663 --> 05:23.531
Should we just reschedule?

05:23.533 --> 05:25.333
I mean, I'm not gonna...
I'm not gonna talk about it

05:25.335 --> 05:26.501
without her being here.

05:26.503 --> 05:28.169
Why not?

05:28.171 --> 05:30.271
It's couple's therapy.

05:30.273 --> 05:31.872
Yes.

05:31.874 --> 05:33.808
Doesn't that by definition
require two people?

05:33.810 --> 05:36.744
Generally, yes, but...

05:36.746 --> 05:39.246
Truth is, it's too bad.

05:39.248 --> 05:41.516
I was actually looking forward
to coming in for once.

05:41.518 --> 05:43.618
You don't always?

05:43.620 --> 05:47.355
I don't know.

05:47.357 --> 05:49.156
I've been thinking maybe we...

05:49.158 --> 05:51.759
maybe we've hit a...
hit a plateau.

05:51.761 --> 05:54.261
Started repeating ourselves

05:54.263 --> 05:57.864
and we've gotten
past the crisis,

05:57.866 --> 06:00.667
we're basically doing well.

06:00.669 --> 06:04.404
And today?

06:04.406 --> 06:06.206
What?

06:06.208 --> 06:07.541
You just said
today was different.

06:07.543 --> 06:09.576
That you wanted to come.

06:09.578 --> 06:13.079
Right.

06:13.081 --> 06:17.984
But maybe you've
changed your mind.

06:20.356 --> 06:23.323
You know, Noah, I'm not
gonna chain you to my couch.

06:23.325 --> 06:24.825
That wouldn't be
very professional.

06:32.400 --> 06:35.502
Let's reschedule
if you want to.

06:35.504 --> 06:39.438
Um...

06:39.440 --> 06:42.375
You could come
Wednesday instead.

06:42.377 --> 06:44.177
I have a 3:15.

06:44.179 --> 06:45.544
Uh, I can't.

06:45.546 --> 06:46.846
I got to take Trevor
to the eye doctor.

06:46.848 --> 06:48.714
He's getting glasses.

06:48.716 --> 06:50.649
Okay.

06:50.651 --> 06:52.185
You know, this whole week
is gonna be tough

06:52.187 --> 06:54.553
'cause, uh, Helen and Vik
went to Africa,

06:54.555 --> 06:56.189
and we got the kids till Sunday.

06:56.191 --> 06:58.824
Helen and Vik
went to Africa?

06:58.826 --> 07:01.261
On safari.
Go figure.

07:01.263 --> 07:03.329
Your ex-wife took off
with her boyfriend

07:03.331 --> 07:06.599
and you have the children
for a whole week?

07:06.601 --> 07:08.067
Is that part of what

07:08.069 --> 07:09.269
you wanted to talk about
with Alison?

07:09.271 --> 07:10.469
No, no.

07:10.471 --> 07:11.971
I'm... I'm happy for Helen.

07:11.973 --> 07:13.773
Well, Vik seems like
a decent guy.

07:13.775 --> 07:16.275
I mean, he's a bit strange,
but that's okay.

07:16.277 --> 07:17.710
Seems to make Helen happy.

07:17.712 --> 07:20.846
Wonderful.

07:23.417 --> 07:25.150
Well, I guess I'll, uh...

07:25.152 --> 07:28.220
I'll go and, uh...

07:28.222 --> 07:30.255
...I'll call you to reschedule.

07:30.257 --> 07:33.325
Okay.

07:33.327 --> 07:36.328
Enjoy your movie.

07:36.330 --> 07:38.964
Ah, fuck it.

07:38.966 --> 07:42.435
This is what I wanted to...

07:42.437 --> 07:44.069
I was hoping we could

07:44.071 --> 07:46.972
deal with.

07:57.550 --> 07:59.318
You're divorced.

07:59.320 --> 08:01.386
It's official.

08:01.388 --> 08:03.555
Hmm.

08:03.557 --> 08:06.825
It came two weeks ago, and...

08:06.827 --> 08:09.761
...I haven't shown it
to Alison yet.

08:13.666 --> 08:15.667
I keep thinking
about Cold Spring.

08:15.669 --> 08:18.036
If I got this letter back then,
I'd have grabbed her

08:18.038 --> 08:20.538
and run to City Hall
immediately.

08:20.540 --> 08:23.775
And now?

08:23.777 --> 08:25.776
I don't know,
if there's one thing

08:25.778 --> 08:27.478
I've learned this past year
and through all this,

08:27.480 --> 08:30.547
it's to think before I act.

08:30.549 --> 08:32.883
Just want to be certain
we're ready.

08:32.885 --> 08:35.818
Do you feel that you're not?

08:35.821 --> 08:37.721
I think I am.

08:37.722 --> 08:40.091
But not Alison?

08:43.628 --> 08:45.662
So what do you think
she might say

08:45.664 --> 08:48.232
if she were here,
if you showed her this?

08:52.337 --> 08:53.670
I don't know.

08:53.672 --> 08:55.672
That's my point.

08:55.674 --> 08:57.774
Are you afraid
she might say no?

08:57.776 --> 08:59.843
That she doesn't
want to get married?

08:59.845 --> 09:02.346
Build a life together?

09:02.348 --> 09:05.916
Because we've... we've talked
about that a lot in here,

09:05.918 --> 09:08.184
these issues of trust.

09:08.186 --> 09:10.286
And it's taken a while,
but I think Alison...

09:10.288 --> 09:12.890
I catch her staring at me.

09:12.892 --> 09:16.259
Sorry?

09:16.261 --> 09:17.861
With Joanie.

09:17.863 --> 09:20.096
I...it happens all the time.

09:20.098 --> 09:22.733
I'm feeding her cereal
or getting her dressed,

09:22.735 --> 09:24.367
and I... I see Alison
watching us.

09:24.369 --> 09:26.136
And it's not just looking.

09:26.138 --> 09:29.205
It's like she's trying to
figure something out.

09:29.207 --> 09:32.543
What?

09:32.545 --> 09:34.511
I don't know.

09:34.513 --> 09:37.514
Whether or not
I want the baby.

09:40.618 --> 09:42.352
I mean, I understand
why she's doing it.

09:42.354 --> 09:44.521
What I did was terrible.

09:44.523 --> 09:46.622
Not making it back
for the birth.

09:46.624 --> 09:48.791
You know, she probably
should've left me then.

09:48.793 --> 09:50.259
I would've left me.

09:50.261 --> 09:51.861
But she didn't.

09:51.863 --> 09:53.596
I know, and I'm incredibly
grateful for that,

09:53.598 --> 09:55.965
and I spent this entire year
trying to make it up to her.

09:55.967 --> 09:59.602
I changed a thousand diapers,
I taught myself to cook,

09:59.604 --> 10:01.737
I washed the dishes,
I folded the laundry,

10:01.739 --> 10:03.606
I've barely written
a fucking word,

10:03.608 --> 10:05.174
all to try to prove to her

10:05.176 --> 10:07.777
how sorry I am
for my insanity.

10:07.779 --> 10:09.679
You've done a tremendous
amount, Noah.

10:09.681 --> 10:11.213
I think Alison knows that.

10:11.215 --> 10:12.548
Except that isn't enough.

10:12.550 --> 10:13.916
Why isn't it enough?

10:13.918 --> 10:16.585
I don't know.

10:16.587 --> 10:20.521
It's just how I feel
when she's looking at me.

10:23.092 --> 10:25.860
Okay, can we...
no more phone.

10:25.862 --> 10:28.563
Let's stick with this
for a minute.

10:28.565 --> 10:30.465
Let's look at
these looks.

10:30.467 --> 10:35.070
You feel some sort of
judgment from Alison?

10:35.072 --> 10:37.839
I guess.

10:37.841 --> 10:40.374
This isn't the first time
you've brought this up in here.

10:40.376 --> 10:43.244
I remember you said something
similar about Whitney.

10:43.246 --> 10:45.780
I did?

10:45.782 --> 10:47.849
Yes, how the last time
you saw her,

10:47.851 --> 10:50.518
she looked at you
with tremendous scorn.

10:50.520 --> 10:52.353
Disappointment.

10:52.355 --> 10:54.722
And then there was
the way you described

10:54.724 --> 10:56.289
how Helen looked at you

10:56.291 --> 10:58.358
when you first told her
about Alison.

10:58.360 --> 11:01.829
I don't understand
where you're going with this.

11:01.831 --> 11:04.498
So these three women
in your life,

11:04.500 --> 11:07.001
you describe as looking at you
in similar ways.

11:07.003 --> 11:08.235
With... With judgment.

11:08.237 --> 11:10.137
For very different reasons.

11:10.139 --> 11:14.842
Okay, but I'm just wondering
if there might be some

11:14.844 --> 11:17.310
connection between them
that we should explore.

11:17.312 --> 11:18.512
Like what?

11:18.514 --> 11:21.581
I'm not sure.

11:21.583 --> 11:24.118
Does anything come to mind
for you?

11:30.824 --> 11:34.194
I want to fuck Lucy Koskoff.

11:36.297 --> 11:38.765
Who's Lucy Koskoff?

11:42.503 --> 11:44.003
She's my student.

11:44.005 --> 11:46.005
She's my best student, in fact.

11:46.007 --> 11:48.941
Damn it.

11:51.979 --> 11:54.147
She's 26, she's hugely talented,

11:54.149 --> 11:55.682
she comes to my office hours

11:55.684 --> 11:58.185
and brings me chapters
from her novel.

11:58.187 --> 12:01.754
She wants to talk
about my novel.

12:01.756 --> 12:04.056
And she's also
made it very clear

12:04.058 --> 12:07.993
that she'd sleep with me
at the drop of a hat.

12:07.995 --> 12:10.095
In fact, I'm meeting her
today at four

12:10.097 --> 12:13.332
to talk over her rewrites.

12:13.334 --> 12:17.102
I know I shouldn't go, but I
can't bring myself to cancel.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.242
Talk about judgmental stares.

12:23.244 --> 12:25.711
I'm not judging, Noah.
I'm just thinking.

12:25.713 --> 12:28.747
Well, don't... just...
just say something.

12:28.749 --> 12:30.316
What would you
like me to say?

12:30.318 --> 12:31.883
Anything, I'd...

12:31.885 --> 12:33.151
I want you to tell me
what we're doing here.

12:33.153 --> 12:34.520
What all this
is for, really?

12:34.522 --> 12:36.522
All this talking
and listening...

12:36.524 --> 12:38.657
Even if I understand,
I... I grasp

12:38.659 --> 12:40.592
all the deep
and painful reasons

12:40.594 --> 12:43.928
why I did what I did
and I want what I want.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.030
I felt dismissed as a writer,

12:46.032 --> 12:47.665
I've held back
in my marriage.

12:47.667 --> 12:49.734
I was craving
acknowledgement, success.

12:49.736 --> 12:51.302
I mean, what does it mean
for me to know all that

12:51.304 --> 12:52.637
if I still just
end up wishing

12:52.639 --> 12:54.972
Lucy would quit
talking metaphors

12:54.974 --> 12:57.242
so I could take off
all her clothes

12:57.244 --> 12:59.644
and just bend her
over my desk?

12:59.646 --> 13:03.648
She isn't the first,
I'm guessing.

13:06.118 --> 13:07.752
What?

13:07.754 --> 13:10.121
Ms. Koskoff can't be
the first woman

13:10.123 --> 13:12.156
you've wanted to cheat with.

13:12.158 --> 13:14.258
You were attracted
to other people

13:14.260 --> 13:16.760
during your 20 years
with Helen.

13:16.762 --> 13:19.095
You say that
like it's a fact.

13:19.097 --> 13:21.531
Oh, then you weren't?

13:21.533 --> 13:25.135
Well, of course I was.

13:25.137 --> 13:26.903
And did you ever
act on it?

13:26.905 --> 13:29.873
No.
You know that.

13:29.875 --> 13:32.142
No, I was faithful
except for Alison.

13:32.144 --> 13:34.544
Then why are you so afraid
you would act on it now?

13:34.546 --> 13:37.414
Because it's different.

13:37.416 --> 13:41.217
Because of Alison, because
you've already done it once.

13:41.219 --> 13:44.120
This is not uncommon

13:44.122 --> 13:47.624
in people whose relationships
began as affairs.

13:47.626 --> 13:51.127
This fear that because
you've strayed once,

13:51.129 --> 13:53.362
you might do it again.

13:57.634 --> 13:59.969
I almost did.

13:59.971 --> 14:03.173
You almost had sex with Lucy?

14:03.175 --> 14:05.008
No, no, not with Lucy, with...

14:05.010 --> 14:07.543
with my publicist, Eden.

14:07.545 --> 14:10.680
That goddamn night
of the hurricane.

14:10.682 --> 14:13.049
The one we've been
over and over and over.

14:13.051 --> 14:16.719
I...well, I...
I left things out.

14:16.721 --> 14:18.121
Yes.

14:18.123 --> 14:20.990
Wait, you knew?

14:26.396 --> 14:28.163
She'd been after me for months.

14:28.165 --> 14:29.765
I kept turning her down,

14:29.767 --> 14:33.135
and then it was the end
of the book tour.

14:33.137 --> 14:35.371
The rain was coming down
sideways,

14:35.373 --> 14:38.307
and we were trapped,
so I...

14:41.177 --> 14:43.546
...I was... I was
ready to do it.

14:43.548 --> 14:45.147
But you didn't.

14:45.149 --> 14:46.215
No.

14:46.217 --> 14:49.151
You stopped yourself.

14:56.625 --> 15:00.995
She went to find us a room,
and I saw these...

15:00.997 --> 15:03.832
Oh, Jesus Christ.

15:03.834 --> 15:07.702
Are you okay?

15:11.107 --> 15:13.107
I saw these two girls
in a hot tub

15:13.109 --> 15:15.377
and I was turned on,

15:15.379 --> 15:18.312
and I was staring at them.

15:20.516 --> 15:23.184
Noah, you do know
I have heard it all.

15:23.186 --> 15:26.120
It was Whitney.

15:29.924 --> 15:33.761
It was my fucking
daughter, I...

15:35.229 --> 15:38.164
just as my new daughter
was being born.

15:40.234 --> 15:43.169
Ugh.

15:45.373 --> 15:48.008
And, I, uh...

15:48.010 --> 15:50.878
it's the last time I saw her.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.279
I ran away.

15:52.281 --> 15:54.882
I left my daughter there,
and I just...

15:54.884 --> 15:57.851
...took off.

16:04.926 --> 16:07.160
So, you see, I didn't
stop myself.

16:07.162 --> 16:10.730
I wouldn't have done.

16:10.732 --> 16:14.467
Because I am a
terrible, terrible,

16:14.469 --> 16:17.470
fucking sick, bad guy.

16:17.472 --> 16:20.840
Oh, fuck.

16:25.579 --> 16:28.415
So do you think this is
why you haven't shown

16:28.417 --> 16:31.784
the divorce papers to Alison?

16:31.786 --> 16:34.487
That these...

16:34.489 --> 16:38.624
these feelings you have
about Alison judging you,

16:38.626 --> 16:42.262
not trusting you, that they
really have more to do with

16:42.264 --> 16:45.898
your not trusting yourself?

16:50.337 --> 16:54.474
The thing about that night,
uh,

16:54.476 --> 16:56.442
as it was going on,

16:56.444 --> 16:58.778
I remember saying to myself,

16:58.780 --> 17:01.246
"It'll... it's okay," you know.

17:01.248 --> 17:02.748
"It'll be okay."

17:02.750 --> 17:05.217
And what does that mean?

17:05.219 --> 17:08.252
Sleeping with Eden,
I knew I was gonna do it.

17:08.255 --> 17:10.189
It was as if I'd
given myself permission.

17:10.191 --> 17:13.358
I'd already forgiven myself.

17:13.361 --> 17:14.961
It wasn't until
I saw Whitney

17:14.963 --> 17:17.896
that I fucking woke up.

17:20.332 --> 17:22.300
And then I... suddenly,
I just had to get out of there.

17:22.301 --> 17:25.169
I didn't want anyone
to see me. It was...

17:25.171 --> 17:27.137
you know that expression,
"I wanted to die"?

17:30.877 --> 17:33.378
I wanted to die.

17:33.380 --> 17:36.247
You wanted to die
rather than face yourself?

17:36.249 --> 17:40.084
Yeah.

17:42.855 --> 17:46.391
You know, Noah,

17:46.393 --> 17:49.293
we have never talked about
your childhood in here.

17:49.295 --> 17:50.361
Ugh.

17:50.363 --> 17:51.630
What?

17:51.632 --> 17:53.864
Now you're gonna shrink me?

17:53.866 --> 17:55.499
Am I going to
psychoanalyze you?

17:55.501 --> 17:56.800
Please don't.

17:56.802 --> 17:58.802
I am curious.

17:58.804 --> 18:00.804
Was your father
faithful to your mother?

18:02.041 --> 18:03.807
That's funny?

18:03.809 --> 18:05.809
Was he not?

18:05.811 --> 18:07.645
My father was the only

18:07.647 --> 18:09.914
faithful trucker
on the eastern seaboard.

18:09.916 --> 18:13.884
The night of my wedding
to Helen,

18:13.886 --> 18:17.087
my father drank six whiskeys.

18:17.089 --> 18:18.756
And he said to Bruce...

18:18.758 --> 18:20.390
Bruce is?

18:20.392 --> 18:21.959
He's my, um, my father-in-law.

18:21.961 --> 18:23.894
My ex father-in-law.
He's a novelist.

18:23.896 --> 18:26.062
My father told him

18:26.064 --> 18:27.897
he was also an artist,

18:27.899 --> 18:29.566
but he gave up in his 40s

18:29.568 --> 18:32.802
to take care of his sick wife.

18:32.804 --> 18:34.037
And is that not true?

18:34.039 --> 18:35.538
No, it's not fucking true.

18:35.540 --> 18:37.406
I cared for his sick wife.

18:37.408 --> 18:40.342
The man did nothing.

18:43.047 --> 18:45.882
I mean, he was an okay husband
until the symptoms got bad,

18:45.884 --> 18:47.383
and then he just checked out.

18:47.385 --> 18:49.652
My sister and I
did everything.

18:49.654 --> 18:51.654
And then she left,
and so it was just me.

18:51.656 --> 18:53.222
Every injection,
every appointment,

18:53.224 --> 18:56.192
giving her baths,
massaging her legs,

18:56.194 --> 18:58.761
and in the end,
changing her diapers

18:58.763 --> 19:02.864
and all the while
he drove his stupid truck

19:02.866 --> 19:06.969
and then watched TV
and drank beer

19:06.971 --> 19:10.339
until he passed out.
Every night.

19:10.341 --> 19:14.276
And he dares tell me
that he loved his wife.

19:16.146 --> 19:19.081
<i>He</i> never cheated.

19:21.118 --> 19:25.354
He genuinely thinks he's a...
he's a... he's a fucking hero.

19:25.356 --> 19:29.125
A good man 'cause he never
stuck his dick in any other...

19:29.127 --> 19:31.026
He was a drunk,

19:31.028 --> 19:33.762
a delinquent father,
and a terrible husband.

19:33.764 --> 19:36.197
And I'm the one
who's cast as villain.

19:36.199 --> 19:38.500
The one who cared
for my mother.

19:38.502 --> 19:40.702
I was there for my children,
and I loved my wife

19:40.704 --> 19:44.673
for 20 years until
I made one mistake.

19:47.477 --> 19:48.944
Sorry, that didn't
come out right.

19:48.946 --> 19:50.345
I don't mean Alison
was a mistake.

19:50.347 --> 19:54.683
No, I understand.

19:54.685 --> 19:57.552
Fuck him.

19:57.554 --> 20:00.455
If that's what being a good man
is, I don't want any part of it.

20:07.764 --> 20:10.131
It makes sense to me,

20:10.133 --> 20:12.133
given the history
you described,

20:12.135 --> 20:15.670
that you might've
developed a skepticism

20:15.672 --> 20:18.972
about fidelity
as a virtue.

20:18.974 --> 20:21.341
Is that fair to say?

20:21.343 --> 20:24.278
I guess.

20:24.280 --> 20:26.380
And that your connection
to Alison and...

20:26.382 --> 20:28.948
and your attraction
to Lucy,

20:28.950 --> 20:32.219
to you, are...

20:32.221 --> 20:34.321
...connected in some way
to your father's hypocrisy.

20:34.323 --> 20:36.290
I think things
are only that simple

20:36.292 --> 20:38.158
in this office, Marilyn.

20:38.160 --> 20:41.161
I think the rest of the time,
we live a complicated,

20:41.163 --> 20:43.830
multifaceted mess,
basically.

20:43.832 --> 20:45.765
You think I haven't
thought about this before?

20:45.767 --> 20:47.534
"I'm angry at my father,
so I cheat."

20:47.536 --> 20:49.102
You know, I'm sorry,
I just don't think

20:49.104 --> 20:50.937
people are that easy
to figure out.

20:50.939 --> 20:52.673
That's fair enough.

20:52.675 --> 20:54.307
I think about these questions,

20:54.309 --> 20:56.475
why people live the way
they do, all the time.

20:56.477 --> 20:57.677
You do?

20:57.679 --> 21:00.279
Yes, I...

21:00.281 --> 21:03.882
Helen once told me that
when she reads obituaries,

21:03.884 --> 21:07.820
she's looking for whether the
person loved and was loved.

21:07.822 --> 21:10.656
Did they have a family,
were they married long,

21:10.658 --> 21:12.091
did they have children,
grandchildren?

21:12.093 --> 21:13.526
And it kind of blew
my mind at the time,

21:13.528 --> 21:14.594
'cause it never
occurred to me

21:14.596 --> 21:17.230
to judge someone
by their family.

21:17.232 --> 21:19.131
Instead, you're looking
at what?

21:20.900 --> 21:23.168
What they... what they did.

21:23.170 --> 21:25.238
Meaning their work,
their accomplishments?

21:25.240 --> 21:27.405
- Yes.
- And yet, there's something

21:27.407 --> 21:29.407
about what Helen said
that stayed with you,

21:29.409 --> 21:31.944
that... that makes you think
she might be on to something.

21:31.946 --> 21:34.679
I just think there are
so many different matrices

21:34.681 --> 21:36.248
by which to measure
a man's worth,

21:36.250 --> 21:38.217
and I... I don't know
which is right.

21:38.219 --> 21:42.221
I'm writing a whole book
about this question.

21:42.223 --> 21:44.189
At least, I'm trying to.

21:44.191 --> 21:46.558
- Your new novel?
- Yeah.

21:46.560 --> 21:49.194
You haven't talked
about that much in here.

21:49.196 --> 21:51.263
Except to say that
it's very different.

21:51.265 --> 21:53.999
It's a real departure
from <i>Descent.</i>

21:54.001 --> 21:55.901
- Right.
- It's historical, right?

21:55.903 --> 21:57.169
- It's World War II?
- Right.

21:57.171 --> 21:58.771
With no women in it?

21:58.773 --> 22:01.439
Did I say that?

22:01.441 --> 22:03.508
You said that you
wanted to be sure

22:03.510 --> 22:06.444
it had nothing to do
with personal relationships.

22:06.446 --> 22:08.980
So there wouldn't be
anything or anyone

22:08.982 --> 22:11.650
that Alison
might think was her.

22:11.652 --> 22:13.951
Well, I was joking.
Kind of.

22:13.953 --> 22:16.988
No, I started off
writing a war story,

22:16.990 --> 22:19.791
and well, it still
is that, essentially.

22:19.793 --> 22:22.427
Can you tell me
a little bit about it?

22:25.331 --> 22:27.732
Do you know who
Omar Bradley is?

22:27.734 --> 22:30.268
Uh, it sounds familiar.

22:30.270 --> 22:31.469
He's a... he's a war hero.

22:31.471 --> 22:33.137
He was a five-star general.

22:33.139 --> 22:35.340
He was the commander of
the First Army at Normandy.

22:35.342 --> 22:36.408
Ah.

22:36.410 --> 22:37.809
The book is based on
his life.

22:37.811 --> 22:39.277
I mean, it's fiction,

22:39.279 --> 22:42.180
but he was fascinating.

22:42.182 --> 22:44.648
He was a great man.

22:44.650 --> 22:48.085
He led this extraordinary,

22:48.087 --> 22:49.954
significant life.

22:49.956 --> 22:51.956
You'd have to write
two or three books

22:51.958 --> 22:53.925
just to cover half
of his achievements.

22:53.927 --> 22:56.294
I spent half
of chapter two

22:56.296 --> 22:59.330
writing about one meeting
he had with Montgomery,

22:59.332 --> 23:03.334
and then I got to
page 65, and...

23:08.540 --> 23:11.008
What happened on page 65?

23:11.010 --> 23:14.244
Marlene Dietrich.

23:14.246 --> 23:15.812
What?

23:15.814 --> 23:17.848
I was gonna leave her out,
but then I just...

23:17.850 --> 23:21.985
I don't know, she somehow
appeared on my screen.

23:21.987 --> 23:23.686
She just appeared?

23:23.688 --> 23:24.821
On her own?

23:24.823 --> 23:26.656
Uh, no.

23:26.658 --> 23:29.425
And then seduced
your main character?

23:31.195 --> 23:32.395
Did you make
this up, or...

23:32.397 --> 23:33.629
No, no, no, no, it happened.

23:33.631 --> 23:34.898
Well, it was rumored to.

23:34.900 --> 23:38.301
There are photos
of them together.

23:38.303 --> 23:40.070
And Bradley was married,
I'm guessing.

23:40.072 --> 23:41.537
For 49 years.

23:41.539 --> 23:43.240
To the girl across the street.

23:43.242 --> 23:45.976
But you see, that's...
that's who he was.

23:45.978 --> 23:47.877
He wasn't just some
fearless leader,

23:47.879 --> 23:49.746
some cartoon Captain America,

23:49.748 --> 23:53.850
he was... he was flawed,
and imperfect, and selfish,

23:53.852 --> 23:58.554
and that, I now realize is
what makes the book compelling.

23:58.556 --> 24:00.456
It's the center of all of it.

24:00.458 --> 24:02.057
What do we make of this guy?

24:02.059 --> 24:03.559
Does the fact
that he had sex

24:03.561 --> 24:04.960
with a movie star
outside marriage,

24:04.962 --> 24:07.096
does that somehow negate
all of his achievements?

24:07.098 --> 24:08.698
Or do those traits
that made him cheat...

24:08.700 --> 24:10.966
ego, intensity, drive...

24:10.968 --> 24:13.603
do they also
lead him to achieve?

24:13.605 --> 24:16.071
Those are some big questions.

24:16.073 --> 24:18.374
Well, I mean, it's
a very big book.

24:18.376 --> 24:20.109
And I hope it's
an important one.

24:20.111 --> 24:22.111
If I could only
fucking finish it.

24:22.113 --> 24:23.913
Are you having trouble?

24:23.915 --> 24:26.081
No, I'm not having trouble.

24:26.083 --> 24:29.118
I just...

24:29.120 --> 24:31.753
Well, the problem is
I don't have any time.

24:31.755 --> 24:34.523
Between the teaching
and the baby, and...

24:34.525 --> 24:35.958
...I need to do
more research.

24:35.960 --> 24:38.727
I need to go to France
and spend six or eight weeks

24:38.729 --> 24:41.030
and see where he lived, and
he fought, and he fucked and...

24:41.032 --> 24:43.632
So why not go?
Buy a ticket.

24:43.634 --> 24:45.134
I'm sure you could
figure it out.

24:45.136 --> 24:47.236
No, Alison's program
is accelerated,

24:47.238 --> 24:49.138
so she's got courses all summer

24:49.140 --> 24:51.606
and the soonest I can get away
is... I don't even fucking know.

24:51.608 --> 24:52.874
Fifteen months?

24:52.876 --> 24:54.276
That's frustrating.

24:54.278 --> 24:56.444
When I go I need... I need
time to write the thing.

24:56.446 --> 24:58.546
I mean, a book like this,
it takes concentration.

24:58.548 --> 25:00.548
Real focus.
It's not some

25:00.550 --> 25:03.284
piece of pulp you can
pump out in ten weeks.

25:03.286 --> 25:05.519
Like <i>Descent,</i> you mean?

25:05.521 --> 25:07.322
<i>Descent</i> is what it is.

25:07.324 --> 25:09.357
It was... It was...

25:09.359 --> 25:11.625
It was... it did
amazingly well.

25:11.627 --> 25:14.595
But I've known for a while
I wanted to take the next step.

25:14.597 --> 25:18.599
I wanted to do something
bigger with real scope.

25:18.601 --> 25:21.269
Something serious
and significant.

25:21.271 --> 25:24.505
So do you notice
that the words you use

25:24.507 --> 25:28.943
to describe Bradley's life...
"big," "significant," "great"...

25:28.945 --> 25:32.279
you're now using them
to describe your new book.

25:32.281 --> 25:33.614
Well, he's the subject
of the book.

25:33.616 --> 25:35.082
But what I'm interested in

25:35.084 --> 25:37.852
is how this subject relates
to your own life.

25:37.854 --> 25:39.920
In your mind.

25:41.958 --> 25:44.959
I want to know...

25:44.961 --> 25:46.527
I want to know if it's possible,

25:46.529 --> 25:49.797
really possible to be both.

25:49.799 --> 25:51.799
Both?

25:51.801 --> 25:54.502
A good man and a great man.

25:54.504 --> 25:56.169
And by good, you mean?

25:56.171 --> 25:58.606
Well, the way Helen reads
the obituaries, you know,

25:58.608 --> 26:01.008
for long-lasting marriages,

26:01.010 --> 26:02.342
for virtue, basically,

26:02.344 --> 26:05.211
monogamy, partnership, love.

26:05.213 --> 26:08.581
I mean, do the men who
Helen thinks led good lives,

26:08.583 --> 26:10.383
how many of them
also had great lives?

26:10.385 --> 26:13.553
Depends on what you mean
by great.

26:13.555 --> 26:15.688
Would General Bradley
have conquered Normandy

26:15.690 --> 26:16.990
if he'd been home
changing diapers?

26:19.426 --> 26:21.060
I'm serious.

26:21.062 --> 26:22.061
You look at the way
this guy led his life.

26:22.063 --> 26:23.262
He went out in the world

26:23.264 --> 26:24.531
and he followed
his instincts,

26:24.533 --> 26:25.899
and he took
whatever he wanted.

26:25.901 --> 26:27.066
Maybe he was narcissistic,

26:27.068 --> 26:28.234
maybe Mary was unhappy,

26:28.236 --> 26:30.269
but his life had consequence.

26:30.271 --> 26:33.272
He basically won
the war for us.

26:33.274 --> 26:35.374
So do we judge him for
his absence for his family

26:35.376 --> 26:38.243
and his infidelity, or
do we just let that slide,

26:38.245 --> 26:40.712
because what does it matter
at the end?

26:40.714 --> 26:42.548
The guy stopped Hitler.

26:42.550 --> 26:44.850
What does it matter to whom?

26:44.852 --> 26:47.819
There's a certain type of man
that history reveres.

26:47.821 --> 26:49.320
We see it over and over.

26:49.322 --> 26:51.322
Jefferson, Hamilton, Picasso,

26:51.324 --> 26:54.192
Hemingway,
all of them cheaters.

26:54.194 --> 26:56.862
It's like they have
this bald desire,

26:56.864 --> 27:00.566
this... this willingness
to take whatever they want,

27:00.568 --> 27:02.400
that ends up
making them remarkable.

27:02.402 --> 27:05.571
But again, I want to understand
how this connects to you.

27:05.573 --> 27:08.506
What if, I mean, what if?

27:08.508 --> 27:13.077
What if I... What if I have it
in me to be great?

27:13.079 --> 27:15.079
What if the only thing
that separates me

27:15.081 --> 27:17.314
from Ernest Hemingway is
that he never had to choose?

27:17.316 --> 27:20.284
He... He... He just gave
himself permission to do

27:20.286 --> 27:22.553
whatever the fuck he wanted
in the name of his work

27:22.555 --> 27:25.322
and he didn't care
who he made suffer.

27:25.324 --> 27:28.325
And he blew out
his brains at 60.

27:30.630 --> 27:32.663
Well, what does that mean?

27:32.665 --> 27:34.799
You tell me.

27:34.801 --> 27:38.335
It's one minute
to three, Noah.

27:38.337 --> 27:40.170
Is it?

27:40.172 --> 27:41.806
But before we stop,

27:41.808 --> 27:43.307
I'd like to return
to where we were

27:43.309 --> 27:45.275
at the start
of the session.

27:45.277 --> 27:48.378
You have some questions
to answer with Alison.

27:48.380 --> 27:52.149
Are you ready to tell her
your divorce is finalized?

27:52.151 --> 27:54.118
And do you actually

27:54.120 --> 27:56.487
want to move forward
with your second marriage?

27:59.757 --> 28:02.826
I know I want to be
a good husband,

28:02.828 --> 28:05.695
I want to be... I want
to be a good partner

28:05.697 --> 28:08.698
and a good father,

28:08.700 --> 28:11.701
and I love having a family,
um, and a home

28:11.703 --> 28:14.304
and people who depend on me,

28:14.306 --> 28:18.041
but I know that in my gut.

28:18.043 --> 28:20.144
But I also
want to go to France,

28:20.146 --> 28:23.046
and... for two years,

28:23.048 --> 28:27.450
and fuck whoever
and feel alive again,

28:27.452 --> 28:29.352
and write a great novel.

28:29.354 --> 28:31.721
What I do not want

28:31.723 --> 28:33.456
is to be dishonest.

28:33.458 --> 28:36.059
I tried that
and I hate myself for it.

28:36.061 --> 28:38.227
I...if there's one thing
I could change,

28:38.229 --> 28:40.063
I do not want to lie...

28:40.065 --> 28:42.298
...to myself or anyone else.

28:44.536 --> 28:46.903
I think that's
admirable, Noah.

28:46.905 --> 28:48.872
I really do.

28:48.874 --> 28:50.306
And we're at time.

28:52.409 --> 28:54.778
So you're gonna be
in here again with Alison,

28:54.780 --> 28:57.613
but before that, I think

28:57.615 --> 29:00.016
it's worth taking the time

29:00.018 --> 29:01.885
to look beyond Bradley,

29:01.887 --> 29:05.054
beyond Jefferson,
beyond whoever.

29:05.056 --> 29:07.723
To another list.

29:07.725 --> 29:12.027
A list of men
who did remarkable things

29:12.029 --> 29:14.230
and remained loyal partners.

29:14.232 --> 29:18.534
We hear about them less,
but they're out there too.

29:18.536 --> 29:19.935
I know that, of course.

29:19.937 --> 29:22.738
And conversely,
what about the average guys?

29:22.740 --> 29:26.742
The dentists and accountants
who cheat on their wives?

29:26.744 --> 29:30.680
A few of them sit right
where you're sitting.

29:30.682 --> 29:33.516
Every week.

29:33.518 --> 29:35.351
How do they fit
into your theory?

29:37.554 --> 29:39.054
You could be in France
right now

29:39.056 --> 29:40.922
with a sitter
minding Joanie.

29:40.924 --> 29:42.691
And you didn't
have to tell me about

29:42.693 --> 29:45.193
your appointment with Lucy.

29:45.195 --> 29:49.130
And the very fact
that you stayed today,

29:49.132 --> 29:51.899
and that you're struggling

29:51.901 --> 29:54.902
with these issues,

29:54.904 --> 29:58.473
to me, that says volumes
about who you really are.

30:00.276 --> 30:04.779
Great, so who am I?

30:10.052 --> 30:11.686
Thank you for the talk.

30:11.688 --> 30:13.187
Thank you for staying.

30:32.407 --> 30:33.774
Oh, hey.

30:33.776 --> 30:35.909
Hey, I'll take over.

30:35.911 --> 30:37.244
You go study.

30:37.246 --> 30:39.480
No, it's okay.
I'm almost done.

30:50.925 --> 30:53.426
Here you go.

30:53.428 --> 30:56.128
Hey, I'm sorry
about missing therapy.

30:56.130 --> 30:58.230
I...I don't know
how I forgot.

30:58.232 --> 30:59.432
It's all right.

30:59.434 --> 31:01.167
Class stressed me out

31:01.169 --> 31:02.802
reviewing things
I thought I knew,

31:02.804 --> 31:04.937
but then I didn't, and...

31:04.939 --> 31:06.773
It's fine.

31:06.775 --> 31:09.776
Actually good to have
some time on my own.

31:09.778 --> 31:12.645
Got myself all figured out.

31:12.647 --> 31:16.316
Oh, yeah? Do tell.

31:18.320 --> 31:22.021
Maybe later.

32:00.827 --> 32:05.429
All of us are human.

32:05.431 --> 32:10.434
We all want answers
to our questions.

32:10.436 --> 32:14.739
We want endings to our stories.

32:14.741 --> 32:18.977
In 2014 alone
in the United States of America,

32:18.979 --> 32:21.913
884 people were killed

32:21.915 --> 32:24.215
in hit-and-run accidents.

32:24.217 --> 32:28.686
Only one in five of those cases
ended in arrest.

32:28.688 --> 32:32.390
Only 20% of victims' families

32:32.392 --> 32:34.825
got the answers
they were looking for.

32:34.827 --> 32:37.094
Now, this is just the beginning
of our time together,

32:37.096 --> 32:38.896
but I want to ask
something of you.

32:38.898 --> 32:41.899
I want to ask each of you
to consider

32:41.901 --> 32:44.535
the very real possibility,

32:44.537 --> 32:47.237
the 80% possibility

32:47.239 --> 32:50.140
that whomever
hit Scott Lockhart that night

32:50.142 --> 32:52.542
and heartlessly
kept on driving,

32:52.544 --> 32:57.047
might not be
in this courtroom today.

32:57.049 --> 32:59.849
In the coming days and weeks,

32:59.851 --> 33:02.052
we are going to learn
a great deal

33:02.054 --> 33:05.255
about the troubled life
of Scott Lockhart.

33:05.257 --> 33:07.791
The customers to whom
he sold cocaine,

33:07.793 --> 33:11.328
the suppliers from whom
he bought that cocaine,

33:11.330 --> 33:15.065
and also about
the many, many women

33:15.067 --> 33:18.135
with which he had...
shall we say,

33:18.137 --> 33:21.305
brief entanglements.

33:21.307 --> 33:25.075
Scotty's own brother, Cole,
married one of these women

33:25.077 --> 33:27.076
at a wedding which took place

33:27.078 --> 33:31.080
the very same night
that Scotty died.

33:31.082 --> 33:34.317
Now, the prosecution
will try to convince you

33:34.319 --> 33:38.455
that this couldn't possibly
have been an accident.

33:38.457 --> 33:42.725
Well, there were
many, many people

33:42.727 --> 33:45.829
who had palpable tensions
with Scott Lockhart.

33:45.831 --> 33:48.431
Many, many people
who had motives

33:48.433 --> 33:51.601
far more realistic than those
assigned to my client.

33:51.603 --> 33:54.303
I want you to just
take note of the crowd

33:54.305 --> 33:56.639
outside this courtroom today.

33:56.641 --> 34:00.242
My client is what we call
a scapegoat,

34:00.244 --> 34:02.178
skewered by a community

34:02.180 --> 34:03.812
who doesn't like
what he wrote about them.

34:03.814 --> 34:05.214
The callous outsider.

34:05.216 --> 34:07.316
The unscrupulous author.

34:07.318 --> 34:10.119
This is a man of fiction.

34:10.121 --> 34:12.621
Someone easy
to point fingers at

34:12.623 --> 34:16.324
when you're searching
for a villain.

34:16.327 --> 34:18.827
Yet this character,

34:18.829 --> 34:21.563
bears absolutely
no resemblance

34:21.565 --> 34:26.202
to the person
sitting next to me,

34:26.204 --> 34:29.105
someone who you will
come to know

34:29.107 --> 34:32.674
as a devoted father,
committed husband,

34:32.676 --> 34:35.275
a hard-working
teacher and writer,

34:35.277 --> 34:37.512
and someone who is

34:37.514 --> 34:40.648
incapable of murder.

34:40.650 --> 34:43.051
And someone who,

34:43.053 --> 34:46.487
at his very essence,

34:46.489 --> 34:50.125
is a good man.

34:53.362 --> 34:56.356
_

35:25.026 --> 35:27.127
Shh.

35:46.681 --> 35:48.381
She go back down?

35:48.383 --> 35:50.916
Thank God.

35:50.918 --> 35:52.418
Next time it's you.

35:52.420 --> 35:54.220
She doesn't want me.

35:54.222 --> 35:55.421
She wants her Mama.

35:55.423 --> 35:57.523
Shh, sleep.

35:57.525 --> 35:59.459
Mmm.

36:27.921 --> 36:29.687
Hmm.

36:29.689 --> 36:31.323
You have to invest ATP

36:31.325 --> 36:33.158
in the beginning,
in order to gain ATP

36:33.160 --> 36:34.593
towards the end.

36:34.595 --> 36:38.029
At Step 7 is where
the pay off begins.

36:38.031 --> 36:41.633
In this stage, you gain
back the two ATPs,

36:41.635 --> 36:44.102
the metabolic energy
you spent earlier.

36:44.104 --> 36:46.605
The two units of
1,3-bisphosphoglycerate

36:46.607 --> 36:49.107
we receive in Step 6,
are now converted

36:49.109 --> 36:52.477
into two units of
3-phosphoglycerate.

36:52.479 --> 36:53.778
This reaction
is catalyzed...

36:53.780 --> 36:55.780
Oh, shit, sorry.

36:55.782 --> 36:57.982
...by phosphoglycerate
kinase.

36:57.984 --> 37:00.618
For those of you now having
mild panic attacks,

37:00.620 --> 37:02.486
a friendly reminder:
because of the switch

37:02.488 --> 37:05.922
in our syllabus, neither
glycolysis nor enzyme kinetics

37:05.924 --> 37:08.058
will be covered
on tomorrow's midterm.

37:08.060 --> 37:09.760
- Yeah!
- Whoo-hoo!

37:09.762 --> 37:12.396
Okay, let's take
a five minute break.

37:12.398 --> 37:14.365
When we come back
we can do some review.

37:14.367 --> 37:17.168
I know a few of you wanted to
go back over protein folding.

37:17.170 --> 37:19.403
And you can ask
any other questions

37:19.405 --> 37:21.738
pertaining to the test.

37:42.193 --> 37:44.827
Uh, Andrew?

37:44.829 --> 37:46.862
Hey, I'm sorry.

37:46.864 --> 37:48.531
You caught me snacking.

37:49.734 --> 37:50.966
Cheddar pop chip?

37:50.968 --> 37:53.703
Oh, no.
No, thank you.

37:53.705 --> 37:57.239
Um, I was just wondering
if you could tell me, uh,

37:57.241 --> 37:59.742
what the last day
to drop this class is.

37:59.744 --> 38:02.945
You're wanting to drop
the class?

38:02.947 --> 38:06.082
Uh, well, I'm not sure,
but I'm... I'm...

38:06.084 --> 38:07.883
Am I that
incomprehensible?

38:07.885 --> 38:09.284
No.

38:09.286 --> 38:10.319
"Stultifyingly" dull.

38:10.321 --> 38:11.453
No, it's nothing like that.

38:11.455 --> 38:14.256
I just, uh,
I somehow thought

38:14.258 --> 38:15.657
this was gonna be
easier, you know?

38:15.659 --> 38:16.826
I have a one-year-old
at home,

38:16.828 --> 38:18.393
and I... I haven't
been sleeping.

38:18.395 --> 38:20.062
You're Alison Bailey,
right?

38:20.064 --> 38:23.032
You're my... You're my
continuing ed student.

38:23.034 --> 38:25.567
Yeah. Yeah, that's me.

38:25.569 --> 38:27.103
You're an RN?

38:27.105 --> 38:28.704
Right.

38:28.706 --> 38:31.806
So a lot of this stuff
isn't new to you.

38:31.808 --> 38:34.142
No, it's not all that new.

38:34.144 --> 38:35.477
It's just been a long time.

38:35.479 --> 38:38.280
It's been a really,
long time and I...

38:38.282 --> 38:42.083
Um, I just want to know
what the deadline is.

38:42.085 --> 38:44.553
Tomorrow, actually.
The halfway mark.

38:44.555 --> 38:46.388
If you withdraw after that,

38:46.390 --> 38:47.789
you get a W
on your transcript,

38:47.791 --> 38:50.392
still pay full tuition.

38:50.394 --> 38:52.261
Ah, okay, thank you.

38:52.263 --> 38:53.262
Hey, could I ask...

38:53.264 --> 38:54.630
Just one second, buddy.

38:54.632 --> 38:57.366
Alison? If your plan

38:57.368 --> 38:58.634
is to go to med school,

38:58.636 --> 39:01.303
I really encourage you
to continue.

39:01.305 --> 39:04.672
The longer you wait,
the harder it may be

39:04.674 --> 39:08.509
to jump back in.

39:08.511 --> 39:10.611
Sorry, what's up?

39:10.613 --> 39:13.381
Had a question about Chapter 4.

39:22.357 --> 39:24.292
All right, people.

39:24.294 --> 39:27.295
Tomorrow, 30 questions.

39:27.297 --> 39:29.862
20 multiple choice,
10 written,

39:29.864 --> 39:31.531
no calculators allowed.

39:31.533 --> 39:33.667
You'll get periodic tables.

39:33.669 --> 39:36.102
Please, do not pull
an all-nighter

39:36.104 --> 39:37.470
for this one, guys.

39:37.472 --> 39:38.938
There's no need
to drown yourself

39:38.940 --> 39:41.441
in caffeine
for my sake.

39:41.443 --> 39:43.777
If you paid attention
in class,

39:43.779 --> 39:47.213
and done the work,
you'll do well.

39:47.215 --> 39:49.115
It's that simple.

39:49.117 --> 39:52.352
All right?

39:52.354 --> 39:54.887
Questions?

39:56.956 --> 39:59.325
Uh, you in the back.

40:16.776 --> 40:19.310
Alison!

40:19.312 --> 40:22.179
Hey, city lady.

40:22.181 --> 40:24.114
Scotty.

40:24.116 --> 40:28.118
Man, y... you look
friggin' fantastic.

40:28.120 --> 40:30.120
- Come here, come on.
- Wh... oh.

40:31.891 --> 40:34.992
Well, I... I don't,
but anyway...

40:34.994 --> 40:37.528
Wh... is everything okay?

40:37.530 --> 40:38.996
Oh, yeah, yeah.

40:38.998 --> 40:41.331
Everything's great.
Everyone is great.

40:41.333 --> 40:45.535
I, um, I've got a business
proposal for you.

40:45.537 --> 40:47.838
Uh, a... sorry?

40:47.840 --> 40:48.938
How about we go up?

40:48.940 --> 40:50.039
Can I come up?

40:50.041 --> 40:52.175
Uh, wh... I don't... my...

40:52.177 --> 40:53.844
well, my daughter
might be napping.

40:53.846 --> 40:55.311
- She sometimes goes down early.
- No, no, no, that's...

40:55.313 --> 40:56.880
that right.
That's... that's cool.

40:56.882 --> 40:59.148
That's, uh, nice.

40:59.150 --> 41:00.717
So, huh.

41:00.719 --> 41:03.420
How about stepping
into my office, then?

41:03.422 --> 41:05.454
Hmm? Ten minutes.

41:05.456 --> 41:06.890
That's all I need, okay?

41:06.892 --> 41:09.658
Come on.

41:11.529 --> 41:13.729
Why are you looking at me
like I'm gonna bite you?

41:13.731 --> 41:15.398
Come on, it... Ali, it's me.

41:15.400 --> 41:17.700
Just have a seat.

41:24.241 --> 41:25.340
Come on, come on.

41:25.342 --> 41:26.408
Okay.

41:28.445 --> 41:31.046
Okay, you ready?

41:31.048 --> 41:32.948
Yeah.

41:32.950 --> 41:35.417
The Lobster Roll.

41:35.419 --> 41:37.119
What about it?

41:37.121 --> 41:40.222
I want to buy it.
With you.

41:40.224 --> 41:42.057
What?

41:42.059 --> 41:43.091
Don't laugh.

41:43.093 --> 41:44.159
I...

41:44.161 --> 41:46.694
You shouldn't be laughing.

41:46.696 --> 41:49.364
What?

41:49.366 --> 41:51.365
Is it even for sale?

41:51.367 --> 41:52.566
Yeah, it's about to be.

41:52.568 --> 41:54.001
I don't know

41:54.003 --> 41:55.369
when the last time
you saw the place was,

41:55.371 --> 41:57.438
but it's a wreck.

41:57.440 --> 42:00.074
Oscar never fixed it up
after the hurricane.

42:00.076 --> 42:03.177
The awnings are trashed,
they're hanging off it.

42:03.179 --> 42:04.678
I went in for a piece of pie
the other day,

42:04.680 --> 42:06.414
the apple rhubarb.

42:06.416 --> 42:07.614
Inedible.

42:07.616 --> 42:10.318
Oscar's bankrupt.

42:10.320 --> 42:14.088
He's... He's he... he is
this close to foreclosure.

42:14.090 --> 42:15.923
And he's already lost
the other property.

42:15.925 --> 42:17.257
So The Roll's gonna
go back to bank.

42:17.259 --> 42:18.559
I'm betting that
we can grab it up

42:18.561 --> 42:20.727
for 1.8, probably
even less.

42:20.729 --> 42:22.429
Look, I... I... I... I
I've got an investor

42:22.431 --> 42:23.630
for half of it, right?

42:23.632 --> 42:24.998
He's a Wall Street guy,

42:25.000 --> 42:27.568
but he's a decent guy.

42:27.570 --> 42:32.172
You throw in
the other half, golden.

42:34.809 --> 42:36.910
You don't look
good to me, Scotty.

42:36.912 --> 42:38.979
Ah, you... you... you
worry too much, Ali.

42:38.981 --> 42:40.146
Come on, you always have.

42:40.148 --> 42:42.281
I'm doing fine.

42:42.283 --> 42:43.983
I'm fine.
Of course,

42:43.985 --> 42:47.086
I will be doing much better

42:47.088 --> 42:51.123
when we open our nightclub.

42:51.125 --> 42:52.458
Our nightclub?

42:52.460 --> 42:53.726
That's fun, right?

42:53.728 --> 42:56.295
Plus, it's fucking lucrative.

42:56.297 --> 42:59.064
I have all the specs
worked out.

42:59.066 --> 43:00.666
You wouldn't
have to do a thing.

43:00.668 --> 43:04.804
Just... Just take a look,
at least.

43:04.806 --> 43:05.938
Come on.

43:10.810 --> 43:12.644
I can't help you.

43:12.646 --> 43:14.078
I'm sorry.

43:14.080 --> 43:15.747
- You got to, actually.
- Well, I can't.

43:17.650 --> 43:18.917
Oh, come on,
Scotty, this is...

43:18.919 --> 43:20.719
No, you come on!

43:20.721 --> 43:22.186
I mean, what the hell, Ali?

43:22.188 --> 43:23.722
Look at where
you're living, huh?

43:23.724 --> 43:27.058
Look at this fucking
shiny tower, huh?

43:27.060 --> 43:28.960
Don't tell me that
you don't have the money!

43:28.962 --> 43:30.228
Well, it isn't mine.

43:30.230 --> 43:31.562
What, it's Noah's?

43:31.564 --> 43:34.865
The renowned author,
Noah Solloway, huh?

43:34.867 --> 43:37.801
Look, first of all,
I know you've got the cash

43:37.803 --> 43:39.404
because I know what
you sold your house for.

43:39.406 --> 43:42.873
Second of all, whatever
money that asshole has,

43:42.875 --> 43:45.543
whatever massive
fucking fortune

43:45.545 --> 43:46.877
he earned off that book,

43:46.879 --> 43:48.846
he fucking owes
to our family.

43:48.848 --> 43:50.314
- Okay, I'm going up.
- It's tragic! Chapter 8, huh?

43:50.316 --> 43:52.150
All that crap
about the feud,

43:52.152 --> 43:54.518
the dealing, you know what?

43:54.520 --> 43:55.953
It had consequences.

43:55.955 --> 43:58.722
Yeah, will you stop?

43:58.724 --> 44:00.123
Every idiot in Montauk

44:00.125 --> 44:02.059
bought and read
that piece of shit,

44:02.061 --> 44:05.429
including Officer Skerry.

44:05.431 --> 44:08.566
You remember him,
huh, Evan?

44:08.568 --> 44:11.435
Evan came down
to the fucking dock

44:11.437 --> 44:14.471
and he told me that he was
done with our arrangement.

44:14.473 --> 44:17.807
He couldn't cover me anymore.
Game over.

44:17.809 --> 44:20.743
So you're done
dealing drugs?

44:22.746 --> 44:23.947
Yeah.

44:23.949 --> 44:25.949
You still taking them?

44:25.951 --> 44:28.251
Huh?

44:28.253 --> 44:31.455
Look, honey, there's Mama!

44:31.457 --> 44:33.090
Hey.

44:39.564 --> 44:40.964
Hey, hi.

44:40.966 --> 44:42.131
- Look who it is.
- Hi, sweetheart.

44:42.133 --> 44:43.900
You're back early.

44:43.902 --> 44:45.868
Uh, yeah, yeah, I am.

44:45.870 --> 44:48.304
I, uh, I ran into
a friend of mine.

44:48.306 --> 44:50.406
Uh, Scotty,
this is Gigi.

44:50.408 --> 44:51.908
Hi.

44:51.910 --> 44:53.576
Is this your daughter?

44:53.578 --> 44:58.081
Yeah, this is Joanie.

44:58.083 --> 45:01.383
Hi, Joanie.

45:01.385 --> 45:03.086
Uh, Gigi, I think...

45:03.088 --> 45:04.252
She's beautiful.

45:04.254 --> 45:05.587
Oh, isn't she, though?

45:05.589 --> 45:07.188
Everybody says
she looks like Alison,

45:07.190 --> 45:09.758
but to me she looks
like her daddy.

45:15.165 --> 45:16.364
Yeah.

45:16.366 --> 45:18.166
Yeah, she does to me, too.

45:22.539 --> 45:25.540
Yeah, I, uh, I think
it's time to go up, right?

45:25.542 --> 45:26.541
- Okay.
- Right, right.

45:26.543 --> 45:28.309
I'll let you, um...

45:28.311 --> 45:30.612
I'll let you go
with her then.

45:30.614 --> 45:33.047
Um...

45:33.049 --> 45:35.816
...it's great
to see you, Ali.

45:40.422 --> 45:42.156
I'm glad I came.

45:49.531 --> 45:52.700
Bring her up now, then?

45:52.702 --> 45:56.936
Are we taking her in, then?

45:56.938 --> 45:59.639
Do you want... do you want
to put her down, or...

45:59.641 --> 46:01.775
Could you, uh, could you...
could you stay

46:01.777 --> 46:04.210
a little longer than 4:00?

46:04.212 --> 46:05.511
Uh, yeah, okay.

46:05.513 --> 46:06.680
Thank you, that's...

46:59.198 --> 47:02.199
Oh, shit.

47:20.585 --> 47:22.753
Hey.

47:22.755 --> 47:24.421
Hi.

47:26.591 --> 47:28.559
So, uh, your call.

47:28.561 --> 47:29.892
Should we hug or do we...

47:29.894 --> 47:31.894
Uh...

47:31.896 --> 47:33.796
- Hi, it's good to see you.
- Yeah.

47:33.798 --> 47:35.164
You too.

47:35.166 --> 47:36.633
I got to admit,
I was surprised

47:36.635 --> 47:38.000
when I saw your number
come up on my phone.

47:38.002 --> 47:39.269
Yeah, I know.

47:39.271 --> 47:41.404
Jane had told me
you moved to Greenpoint.

47:41.406 --> 47:43.506
I wasn't sure
I believed her.

47:43.508 --> 47:45.107
And yet, here I am.

47:45.109 --> 47:48.144
Here you are.

47:48.146 --> 47:50.079
- Hey, Reggie?
- Yeah?

47:50.081 --> 47:52.782
Can we get my friend,
Alison, here a drink?

47:52.784 --> 47:54.150
Sure, what would you like
today, friend Alison?

47:54.152 --> 47:56.819
Uh, a Blanton neat, please.

47:56.821 --> 47:58.220
Really?

47:58.222 --> 48:00.222
Blanton neat.

48:00.224 --> 48:02.491
And, uh,
and some olives too.

48:02.493 --> 48:04.326
Hmm, addict.

48:04.328 --> 48:06.061
You got to try these things,
they're amazing.

48:06.063 --> 48:07.129
I don't know what
they put on them,

48:07.131 --> 48:08.297
but they are great.

48:08.299 --> 48:09.398
It's, like,
crack or something.

48:09.400 --> 48:11.667
Seems like you
come here a lot.

48:11.669 --> 48:13.535
Well, yeah,
Luisa's restaurant's

48:13.537 --> 48:15.171
right across the street.

48:15.173 --> 48:16.705
The one with
the brown awnings.

48:16.707 --> 48:18.240
That's her restaurant?

48:18.242 --> 48:20.309
Yeah, I mean,
it's not hers, hers.

48:20.311 --> 48:22.944
She's the manager,
so I come here, hang out,

48:22.946 --> 48:24.045
I try not to
get in the way.

48:26.183 --> 48:28.716
She's off in 15 minutes.
You get to meet her.

48:28.718 --> 48:32.287
Oh, great.

48:32.289 --> 48:35.990
So, uh, what have you
been doing?

48:35.992 --> 48:37.225
You working?

48:37.227 --> 48:39.627
Uh, yeah, in...

48:39.629 --> 48:41.896
her cousin's
in construction

48:41.898 --> 48:43.898
so I've been picking up odd jobs
with him here and there.

48:43.900 --> 48:46.000
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

48:46.002 --> 48:48.502
Well, do you... do you need
to be doing that? I mean,

48:48.504 --> 48:49.838
I know you haven't touched
the money from the house.

48:49.840 --> 48:51.806
It's still
sitting in escrow.

48:51.808 --> 48:53.341
It's 'cause it's
your money, Alison.

48:53.343 --> 48:54.508
I don't want it.

48:54.510 --> 48:55.843
Look, I've taken mine out.

48:55.845 --> 48:57.645
The rest is yours.

48:57.647 --> 48:59.847
If you leave it there,
it's gonna stay there forever.

48:59.849 --> 49:02.282
You know, I actually
like this work.

49:02.284 --> 49:04.051
Good for me to be working
with my hands again.

49:04.053 --> 49:05.118
And I'm picking up
some Spanish.

49:05.120 --> 49:06.286
Oh, yeah?

49:06.288 --> 49:08.055
Turns out
I'm not too bad at it.

49:08.057 --> 49:10.290
Okay.

49:10.292 --> 49:11.959
Say something.

49:11.961 --> 49:14.261
- In Spanish?
- Mm-hmm.

49:14.263 --> 49:17.197
Okay, uh...

49:20.369 --> 49:22.569
<i>Me voy a casar.</i>

49:22.571 --> 49:25.472
Nice.
Uh, and that means?

49:25.474 --> 49:28.975
It means I'm getting married.

49:31.178 --> 49:32.345
Oh, God, wow.

49:32.347 --> 49:33.913
- Cole, that's...
- Yeah.

49:33.915 --> 49:35.448
Yeah, I mean,
I know it's fast, but...

49:35.450 --> 49:38.418
No.
No, no, it's great.

49:38.420 --> 49:42.054
It's... It's wonderful.

49:44.191 --> 49:46.325
Thanks, Ali.

49:49.463 --> 49:51.798
You look happy.

49:51.800 --> 49:54.401
Yeah, I am.

49:54.403 --> 49:56.235
Yeah.

49:56.237 --> 49:59.038
I really am.
How you doing?

49:59.040 --> 50:01.941
Me? Uh, yeah, well,
I mean, I'm good.

50:01.943 --> 50:04.944
I'm... well, I'm... I'm...
I'm busy, you know?

50:04.946 --> 50:06.612
Yeah, yeah, sure.

50:06.614 --> 50:08.047
I mean, with the kid,
it must be.

50:08.049 --> 50:09.481
Yeah.

50:13.520 --> 50:15.854
How's she doing?

50:15.856 --> 50:19.291
Yeah, she's...

50:19.293 --> 50:22.227
she's great.

50:25.031 --> 50:28.566
Hmm, that's good to hear.

50:28.568 --> 50:30.235
She's got to be getting old now.

50:30.237 --> 50:33.771
Yeah, yeah, she's almost a year.

50:33.773 --> 50:35.606
Oh.

50:35.608 --> 50:38.209
Blanton neat for you.

50:38.211 --> 50:40.378
Thank you, that's...

50:40.380 --> 50:42.580
- And your daily fix, sir.
- Thank you.

50:42.582 --> 50:44.049
Anything else?

50:44.051 --> 50:46.117
Uh, no, no, I'm fine.
I just...

50:46.119 --> 50:47.351
We're good, Reg.

50:47.353 --> 50:49.253
All right, I'll be here.

50:49.255 --> 50:51.621
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

51:04.035 --> 51:05.635
Mmm, you're right.

51:05.637 --> 51:06.636
That's a... That's a good olive.

51:06.638 --> 51:08.538
Right?

51:10.275 --> 51:13.077
So...

51:13.079 --> 51:14.878
What did you want
to see me about?

51:20.584 --> 51:23.919
Uh...

51:23.921 --> 51:28.324
I, um...

51:28.326 --> 51:30.526
You okay?
Is everything all right?

51:30.528 --> 51:33.696
Did something bad happen?

51:36.700 --> 51:38.101
Uh...

51:39.703 --> 51:41.971
I saw Scotty this morning.

51:41.973 --> 51:44.773
Yeah?

51:44.775 --> 51:46.476
Yeah, he was waiting
outside my apartment.

51:46.478 --> 51:47.910
He didn't look
so good, Cole.

51:47.912 --> 51:49.245
He...

51:49.247 --> 51:50.446
Is that it?

51:50.448 --> 51:52.247
That's all you want
to tell me?

51:52.249 --> 51:54.649
Yeah. Yeah, well, he... he...
I mean, he didn't look well.

51:54.651 --> 51:58.120
He was... He was strung out,
like, almost manic,

51:58.122 --> 51:59.954
and he had some plan about
buying The Lobster Roll,

51:59.956 --> 52:01.323
and wanted me to
go in with him.

52:01.325 --> 52:02.690
That's been his plan
for a while now.

52:02.692 --> 52:04.893
Well, I don't know
if he's using, but...

52:04.895 --> 52:06.561
I'm sure that he is.

52:06.563 --> 52:08.663
And you... you don't care?

52:08.665 --> 52:11.433
No, I do not care.
Not anymore.

52:11.435 --> 52:13.601
I can't tell you how
fucking good it feels

52:13.603 --> 52:16.405
to stop having to care

52:16.407 --> 52:18.040
about my family and their

52:18.042 --> 52:20.675
spectacular dysfunction
all the time,

52:20.677 --> 52:23.545
to worry about me and my
life for a little while.

52:23.547 --> 52:26.381
So Scotty can snort his
life away for all I care.

52:26.383 --> 52:28.016
And he can buy
The Lobster Roll,

52:28.018 --> 52:31.252
he can build that heinous
monstrosity of a nightclub

52:31.254 --> 52:33.988
and really do whatever
the fuck he wants.

52:33.990 --> 52:36.157
I mean, it's not like he's
gonna get that money anyway.

52:36.159 --> 52:38.693
Or that The Lobster Roll
is even for sale.

52:38.695 --> 52:41.328
Well, no, it's...
it's in foreclosure.

52:41.330 --> 52:43.264
Really?

52:43.266 --> 52:45.533
Or it's about to be,
I mean, that's what he said.

52:45.535 --> 52:49.503
He said it... it...
he said it's closing.

52:49.505 --> 52:51.973
God, I hated hearing that.

52:51.975 --> 52:54.909
Yeah.

52:58.714 --> 53:01.215
You remember your birthday
when we went there?

53:01.217 --> 53:02.816
- It was late, like,
- Oh.

53:02.818 --> 53:03.917
I don't know,
3:00 in the morning.

53:03.919 --> 53:05.086
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
- We were all

53:05.088 --> 53:06.920
completely stoned
out of our trees.

53:06.922 --> 53:08.122
Which birthday was that?

53:08.124 --> 53:09.490
That was my 16th.

53:09.492 --> 53:11.425
That's right, your Sweet 16.

53:11.427 --> 53:13.227
How did we get in?
Did we break in?

53:13.229 --> 53:14.795
No, I had keys.
I used to open...

53:14.797 --> 53:16.097
- ...on Sunday mornings.
- Yeah, that's right.

53:16.099 --> 53:17.465
That's right,
and we go in,

53:17.467 --> 53:20.000
and you pull out that
huge vat of ice cream.

53:20.002 --> 53:21.302
And then Scotty burnt his hand.

53:21.304 --> 53:22.769
What?

53:22.771 --> 53:24.271
Oh, yeah, Scotty burnt the
shit out of his hand...

53:24.273 --> 53:26.107
- ...in the fryer.
- Oh, oh, my God.

53:26.109 --> 53:27.641
I'd completely forgotten that.

53:29.278 --> 53:31.877
Ah, shit.

53:34.448 --> 53:36.916
That used to be a great place.

53:36.918 --> 53:39.119
Yeah.

53:40.455 --> 53:42.755
Hey, you're done.

53:44.958 --> 53:46.392
Alison?

53:46.394 --> 53:48.761
Hi, Luisa, hi.

53:48.763 --> 53:51.164
- How are you?
- Uh, yeah, I'm good.

53:51.166 --> 53:53.500
- So how was work?
- You know, it was good.

53:53.502 --> 53:54.800
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

53:54.802 --> 53:56.769
Oh, uh, congratulations.

53:56.771 --> 53:58.738
Cole told me
about the engagement.

53:58.740 --> 54:00.439
Oh, thank you.

54:00.441 --> 54:03.542
I'm really happy
for you and him.

54:03.544 --> 54:06.112
Yeah, it's kind of
surprising, huh?

54:06.114 --> 54:08.280
Cole Lockhart
living in the city.

54:08.282 --> 54:10.716
Kind of surprising?

54:10.718 --> 54:13.385
This is good for him.

54:13.387 --> 54:16.789
You know, a new start.

54:18.959 --> 54:21.527
Yeah, uh, well, I... I...

54:21.529 --> 54:22.995
I better be going.

54:22.997 --> 54:24.797
My, uh, you know,
sitter's, like, waiting.

54:24.799 --> 54:26.330
- Right.
- Uh, let me just...

54:26.332 --> 54:27.632
...get some money
for this.

54:27.634 --> 54:28.733
No, no, don't worry.
I got it.

54:28.735 --> 54:30.268
Cole, come on,
please, I just...

54:30.270 --> 54:31.836
Alison,

54:31.838 --> 54:34.172
I got it.

54:34.174 --> 54:37.175
Okay, thank you.

54:37.177 --> 54:40.111
Well, it was nice to meet you.

54:40.113 --> 54:41.780
Nice to meet you too.

54:41.782 --> 54:44.049
Bye.

55:06.771 --> 55:08.239
I'm ahead of you.

55:08.241 --> 55:10.908
Hey, guys.

55:10.910 --> 55:12.176
What are you doing?

55:12.178 --> 55:13.844
We're skiing.
Want a turn?

55:13.846 --> 55:16.247
No, I'm okay.

55:16.249 --> 55:18.048
Keep warm, though.

55:18.050 --> 55:19.250
Oh, my God.

55:19.252 --> 55:20.951
No, let me take that.

55:20.953 --> 55:22.953
Yeah.

55:22.955 --> 55:25.622
Sorry.

55:25.624 --> 55:29.126
Good girl.

55:29.128 --> 55:31.195
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

55:31.197 --> 55:33.864
Hey, you cooked.

55:33.866 --> 55:35.065
Where the hell were you?

55:35.067 --> 55:36.366
You missed therapy.

55:36.368 --> 55:39.402
I know, I'm sorry.
Hey, sweetie.

55:39.404 --> 55:42.004
How are you?

55:42.006 --> 55:44.207
I'm really sorry.

55:44.209 --> 55:45.742
I completely screwed up.

55:45.744 --> 55:47.677
I went to class,
and then I...

55:47.679 --> 55:48.945
It's fine.

55:48.947 --> 55:50.012
I figured you
weren't coming,

55:50.014 --> 55:51.848
so I left and went
to a movie.

55:51.850 --> 55:53.283
What movie?

55:53.285 --> 55:54.384
<i>Captain America.</i>

55:57.421 --> 56:00.089
Listen, I've been thinking
maybe we should quit therapy.

56:00.091 --> 56:02.359
You want to stop?

56:02.361 --> 56:04.160
Don't you?

56:04.162 --> 56:07.596
We've kind of run out
of things to talk about.

56:07.598 --> 56:09.198
Aren't we all happy again?

56:09.200 --> 56:10.867
Hmm?

56:13.804 --> 56:16.739
Yeah, we are.

56:19.576 --> 56:21.811
Hey, hmm.

56:21.813 --> 56:24.747
Come on, let's eat.

56:51.073 --> 56:52.607
I love you.

56:52.609 --> 56:54.009
I love you.

56:54.011 --> 56:55.310
I love you,
I love you.

56:55.312 --> 56:57.345
I love you.

56:59.616 --> 57:03.051
I love you.

57:03.053 --> 57:05.686
I love you.

57:08.224 --> 57:09.723
Dada.

57:09.725 --> 57:11.926
Was that her?

57:11.928 --> 57:13.194
I think so.

57:13.196 --> 57:14.728
Dada.

57:14.730 --> 57:17.698
What'd she say?

57:17.700 --> 57:21.535
Dada.

57:26.709 --> 57:30.077
Go, go.

57:37.152 --> 57:40.420
Dada.

57:40.422 --> 57:43.757
Yes, where's my Joanie?

57:43.759 --> 57:46.693
- Dada.
- Did you say Dada?

57:56.471 --> 57:58.004
We're back in two minutes,

57:58.006 --> 57:59.406
and this just came back
from the lab.

57:59.408 --> 58:00.807
Reed drove it out here.

58:00.809 --> 58:03.443
Open it.
