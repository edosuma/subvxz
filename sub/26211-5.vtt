17:07.667 --> 17:09.667
- [laughs softly]

17:09.700 --> 17:11.567
- Here.
[soft laughter]

17:11.600 --> 17:14.567
- I'm very confused about
what the dynamic is

17:14.600 --> 17:16.433
between Chandler and myself.

17:16.467 --> 17:18.166
I mean,
he's absolutely adorable,

17:18.200 --> 17:20.533
but he doesn't open up
very easily.

17:20.567 --> 17:22.333
I'm like, "Who are you?"

17:22.367 --> 17:24.700
Just show--give me something
so I know that you've got--

17:24.734 --> 17:27.600
you know, it's not just,
like, boatswain Chandler.

17:27.633 --> 17:30.033
- I got that for you.
- You're so sweet.

17:30.066 --> 17:32.033
Oh, my God.

17:32.066 --> 17:36.133
- I need everybody assembled
on the aft deck immediately.

17:36.166 --> 17:38.300
- Look at that mega yacht.
It's ridiculous.

17:38.333 --> 17:40.066
Huh?
Gonna have fun?

17:40.100 --> 17:42.166
- Lose the shades.
- Lose the shades.

17:42.200 --> 17:43.467
- Here we go.
Don't fall. [laughs]

17:43.500 --> 17:45.033
- Here we go.
- Hey, guys.

17:45.066 --> 17:46.333
- How we doing?
Welcome aboard.

17:46.367 --> 17:47.700
- How's it going?
Pleasure. Charles.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.200
- Hi.
Welcome.

17:49.233 --> 17:50.567
- Thank you very much.

17:50.600 --> 17:52.166
Put this on my neck?
- Yes.

17:52.200 --> 17:53.567
- Welcome aboard.
- Jolie, nice meeting you.

17:53.600 --> 17:56.200
- Hi there. I'm Ashton.
- Hi.

17:56.233 --> 17:57.600
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

17:57.633 --> 18:00.734
- [high-pitched]
Whoo-hoo. Whoo-hoo.

18:00.734 --> 18:03.600
Whoo-hoo.
[indistinct chatter]

18:03.633 --> 18:06.367
Whoo-hoo.
Whoo-hoo.

18:08.500 --> 18:10.467
- [sighs]
I'm already over it.

18:10.500 --> 18:12.767
- Welcome aboard "My Seanna,"
everybody.

18:12.767 --> 18:14.767
We've got a great three days
planned for you.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.166
Kate will take you
on a tour of the yacht,

18:17.200 --> 18:19.100
and we will be
under way shortly...

18:19.133 --> 18:20.633
- Looking forward to it.
- And get started.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.100
- So serious question,
do I have to keep this on?

18:22.100 --> 18:25.200
- No...
[laughs]

18:25.233 --> 18:26.633
This is the sun deck,

18:26.633 --> 18:28.567
and then up there
we have a crow's nest,

18:28.600 --> 18:31.066
but it's a really a wonderful
location for sunsets.

18:31.100 --> 18:32.433
- A lot of sun tanning.
I might need that sunscreen.

18:34.533 --> 18:36.567
- Got to.
- Take one at a time.

18:36.600 --> 18:38.467
- And then we'll
go into the sky lounge.

18:38.500 --> 18:40.166
- It's not bad. That's average
about two a person.

18:40.200 --> 18:42.000
- Yeah, that's good.

18:42.033 --> 18:43.667
- Now we're gonna go
to your master stateroom,

18:43.667 --> 18:46.266
which is so large and lovely.
[indistinct chatter]

18:46.266 --> 18:48.400
It's huge.
- Seriously amazing.

18:48.400 --> 18:51.100
- Let's go take some photos.
- Yeah, let's do it.

18:51.133 --> 18:53.000
- Let's get rid of all
unnecessary lines

18:53.033 --> 18:54.533
on the bow off of here.
- All right.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.266
- Look at Jen, Instagramming.

18:56.266 --> 18:58.000
I'm Instagramming
her Instagramming.

18:58.033 --> 19:00.133
- Well, what did you think?
First impression?

19:00.166 --> 19:02.667
- They seem a little bit
high maintenance.

19:02.700 --> 19:04.400
- The lighting's so good.

19:04.400 --> 19:05.667
- Lips.
- [laughs]

19:05.700 --> 19:07.533
- I got the Captain behind me.

19:07.567 --> 19:09.133
- Freeze frame.

19:18.500 --> 19:20.066
Awesome.

19:20.100 --> 19:22.633
- These people are
disgustingly obsessed

19:22.667 --> 19:25.633
with their phones and
their social media interaction,

19:25.667 --> 19:28.233
but also, I'm here for it
because I believe

19:28.266 --> 19:32.300
this is the next level
of Darwin's natural selection.

19:32.300 --> 19:35.533
- The camera loves me...
[laughs]

19:35.567 --> 19:37.400
- Darwin's coming for you,
Charles Yim.

19:37.433 --> 19:39.433
- Let's go ahead and cut
the stern loose, please.

19:39.467 --> 19:41.533
- Copy that.

19:41.567 --> 19:43.433
All right, Captain,
stern line's off.

19:43.433 --> 19:46.400
- Okay, let's pull up on it.
- All right, Captain,

19:46.433 --> 19:50.166
you're free to maneuver.

19:50.200 --> 19:51.533
Deck crew, let's get
some of these fenders in

19:51.567 --> 19:53.033
in the meantime.

19:53.066 --> 19:54.400
- You can go ahead
and close that,

19:54.433 --> 19:55.533
and then I'll call you
when I need you.

19:55.567 --> 19:57.166
- This is my Milly-Milly dance.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.233
It's gonna become
Instagram famous.

20:00.433 --> 20:02.000
- We're still on the
same plan for lunch?

20:02.033 --> 20:05.100
- 1:30.

20:05.133 --> 20:07.700
- Rhylee, do not drag
the fender across the deck.

20:07.734 --> 20:09.700
- You asked me to bring
fenders up here.

20:09.734 --> 20:11.567
- What did we talk
about the other day?

20:11.600 --> 20:13.333
Rhylee, two people
on each fender.

20:13.333 --> 20:14.700
I don't want to drag them
across the deck.

20:14.734 --> 20:16.400
If you can carry it
off the teak,

20:16.433 --> 20:18.200
then yes,
you're more than welcome to.

20:18.233 --> 20:19.567
- Well, of course I can't,
not with the width there--

20:19.600 --> 20:21.300
- Okay, well,
then wait for someone.

20:21.333 --> 20:23.400
I've told Rhylee
dozens of times

20:23.433 --> 20:25.333
not to drag the fenders
across the deck.

20:25.367 --> 20:28.333
It is extremely frustrating
to see that happen,

20:28.333 --> 20:30.066
especially in front
of the bridge.

20:30.066 --> 20:31.433
Him and I both know that
that's not acceptable.

20:31.467 --> 20:33.066
It looks sh---y
dragging fenders.

20:33.066 --> 20:35.033
- Yeah, and I will wait
for the last one.

20:35.066 --> 20:37.333
Chandler is really good
at telling me what I do wrong

20:37.333 --> 20:39.066
and not telling me
anything I do right.

20:39.066 --> 20:40.533
I'm not trying
to sabotage the ship.

20:40.567 --> 20:42.467
I'm just trying to do my job.

20:42.500 --> 20:44.600
- Work smart, not hard.

20:44.633 --> 20:46.333
- Can I bring anything
for anybody?

20:46.367 --> 20:48.200
- Yeah, I'll do a 1942.
- You got it.

20:48.233 --> 20:50.100
- Do you guys have orange rind,
like, orange twist?

20:50.133 --> 20:51.500
- I can get you orange, yeah.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.066
- And then just
stick it in there neat.

20:53.100 --> 20:55.233
- Absolutely. You got it.
Anybody else?

20:55.266 --> 20:56.500
- Could I just do
a lemon water?

20:56.533 --> 20:58.767
- I'll do just
a tequila as well.

20:58.767 --> 21:00.333
- Iced tea.
- Iced tea.

21:00.367 --> 21:02.367
- By the way, if you don't
mind me asking--

21:02.367 --> 21:03.767
- No, please.
- How did you hurt your toe?

21:03.767 --> 21:05.500
- Oh, my God,
so I got a mosquito bite,

21:05.500 --> 21:07.200
and it just went poof.

21:07.233 --> 21:08.600
- Ouch.
- It's cool, it's cool.

21:08.633 --> 21:11.333
It's mind over matter.
- Wow, impressive.

21:11.367 --> 21:13.233
- You guys can change
out of your whites

21:13.266 --> 21:14.700
and into your blues.

21:14.734 --> 21:16.367
- Copy, copy.

21:20.233 --> 21:21.700
- 'Sup, cuz?

21:21.734 --> 21:24.100

through deck checks

21:24.100 --> 21:26.066
as long as we do our rounds.

21:26.100 --> 21:28.100
So, I would take
this time to relax.

21:28.100 --> 21:30.000
- Do you want to just call--
maybe call Rhylee down?

21:30.000 --> 21:31.400
'Cause I think she's out there
doing something...

21:31.433 --> 21:34.533
[laughter]

21:34.567 --> 21:37.734
I completely get that
Chandler doesn't like Rhylee,

21:37.767 --> 21:41.133
but I feel like he's letting
his dislike for Rhylee

21:41.166 --> 21:42.734
cloud his judgments.

21:42.767 --> 21:44.400
You need to be able
to set your emotions aside

21:44.433 --> 21:46.000
from your professional job.

21:46.033 --> 21:48.633
I'm gonna go help Rhylee.

just let me know.

more than that.

Caroline, Caroline. Kate.

22:15.533 --> 22:17.133
Yeah, there's
three tequilas up here.

22:17.166 --> 22:19.433
Do you want me
to bring them down?

22:19.467 --> 22:21.567
- Yeah.
Sorry, I was with guests,

22:21.567 --> 22:24.567

the orange rind

come back up here?

22:30.266 --> 22:31.667

22:31.700 --> 22:33.567
I just need to bring
a spoon for the sugar.

asking for tequila shots,

22:36.000 --> 22:38.400
which is easier
than a bottle of water.

22:38.433 --> 22:40.667
- I've got a spoon here.
- They're getting annoyed.

22:40.700 --> 22:43.100

I want you to stay on service

then answer the door naked,

tequila needs is orange?
