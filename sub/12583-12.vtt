WEBVTT

00:33.825 --> 00:35.910
See, Dale, I'm a man of my word.

00:35.994 --> 00:38.121
You didn't cry when you got
your tetanus shot,

00:38.204 --> 00:39.581
so ice cream's on me.

00:39.664 --> 00:41.082
How much will you guys give me

00:41.166 --> 00:43.626
if I literally scream for ice cream?

00:44.252 --> 00:46.171
Dude, let's run back and forth!

00:48.757 --> 00:51.217
Bobby! Never run in a parking lot!

00:51.301 --> 00:52.635
Those cars look parked,

00:52.719 --> 00:55.221
but they could be driven
by slow-moving seniors.

00:55.305 --> 00:57.515
Yes, sir. Sorry, Dad.

00:57.599 --> 00:58.767
Joseph, stop that.

00:58.850 --> 01:00.435
Yeah, in a minute.

01:01.936 --> 01:04.481
Joseph, cut that out! It's dangerous.

01:04.564 --> 01:06.232
Okay. Sorry, Mr. Hill.

01:06.316 --> 01:08.777
Don't make Hank have to tell you again.

01:11.988 --> 01:13.281
Okay, we're gonna take the hill.

01:13.364 --> 01:14.282
But I'm scared, so...

01:14.365 --> 01:15.366
We're all scared, Sarge.

01:15.450 --> 01:17.410
Move up the hill right now! Yes, sir.

01:17.494 --> 01:19.079
Son, mind your table manners.

01:19.162 --> 01:21.498
Okay. But what about Ma?
I'll write your mom when you get back.

01:21.581 --> 01:23.833
Son, I think I asked you...

01:26.127 --> 01:27.670
Oh, you gotta put that out.

01:27.754 --> 01:30.090
No more smoking in restaurants, remember?

01:30.173 --> 01:33.301
Excuse me? Miss, this is Texas.

01:33.384 --> 01:36.262
Arlen passed
that no-smoking ballot initiative, Dale.

01:36.346 --> 01:37.889
Let me just finish this one.

01:37.972 --> 01:39.099
Put it out!

01:41.059 --> 01:43.686
But... But my rights...

01:47.023 --> 01:48.233
I surrender!

01:48.316 --> 01:50.944
Hut, two, three,
back in line, son...

01:52.487 --> 01:54.030
Outrageous.

01:54.656 --> 01:55.573


01:55.657 --> 01:58.785
Sure, today it's us smokers,
but who tomorrow?

01:59.619 --> 02:03.373
Pudgy white guys
with strange propane fixations?

02:03.456 --> 02:06.376
Dale, that smoking ban barely squeaked by.

02:06.459 --> 02:08.461
But it did pass, so it's the law.

02:08.545 --> 02:10.088
That's awfully convenient.

02:10.171 --> 02:12.423
Especially since I didn't vote.

02:12.507 --> 02:13.383
I voted.

02:13.466 --> 02:15.802
I guessed right four out of five times.

02:18.638 --> 02:20.765
All right, everyone, settle.
It's assignment time.

02:21.474 --> 02:24.394
Okay, Peggy, you're all set
with your Waffle House beat.

02:25.103 --> 02:26.688
Yeah, about that, Roddy Rae.

02:26.771 --> 02:28.189
I was thinking this week,

02:28.273 --> 02:30.733
instead of writing something unimportant,

02:30.817 --> 02:32.861
I could cover something important.

02:32.944 --> 02:33.903
Change of pace.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.406
Sorry, Peg. Now, everyone else.

02:36.489 --> 02:39.075
The crossing guards are about
to have a major contract dispute.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.910
I call it! It's mine! Me!

02:40.994 --> 02:44.080
Peggy, no. I need a seasoned hand on this.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.623
Jenkins, you've got the touch.

02:45.707 --> 02:47.208
Wanna look into this monkey business?

02:47.876 --> 02:50.628
Monkey business is my business.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.217
Uh, Joseph?

02:56.301 --> 02:57.177
Yeah?

02:57.260 --> 02:59.721
Don't you think you've been in there
kind of a long time?

02:59.804 --> 03:00.680
I don't know.

03:00.763 --> 03:01.931
It's been 40 minutes.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.475
Maybe other people need
to use the bathroom, too.

03:04.559 --> 03:05.977
Get out of the bathroom, shug.

03:06.060 --> 03:06.936
Sure, Mom.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.229
When you're done, come get me.

03:08.313 --> 03:09.439
I don't know where I'll be.

03:13.735 --> 03:16.279
Aren't you supposed to be
reporting on the Waffle House?

03:16.362 --> 03:17.614
Why waste my time?

03:17.697 --> 03:21.201
I can file my story now.
"Nothing Happened. Again."

03:21.284 --> 03:22.994
Roddy Rae hits the "delete" key,

03:23.077 --> 03:24.746
and we are done for another week.

03:29.334 --> 03:30.627
Oh, hey, Hank.

03:30.710 --> 03:33.254
Listen, I just had sort of
a quick question.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.048
How do I get my son to respect me?

03:36.090 --> 03:39.344
Well, boys need their dads
to be strong role models.

03:39.427 --> 03:42.388
You just need to, you know... be a man.

03:43.014 --> 03:45.475
Dammit, Hank, I'm 42 years old.

03:45.558 --> 03:49.062
It's kind of late for me to start
the whole "being a man" thing.

03:49.145 --> 03:51.606
Is there a shortcut,
or at least a, a website?

03:51.689 --> 03:52.941
No.

03:53.483 --> 03:54.901
This is gonna be tough.

03:54.984 --> 03:56.819
I can't even take that like a man.

04:01.282 --> 04:02.992
Son? Would you reach me the toast?

04:03.076 --> 04:04.661
Sure thing, Pop.

04:04.744 --> 04:05.995
Bastards.

04:08.122 --> 04:10.083
Sorry, honey, you can't smoke in here.

04:10.166 --> 04:11.668
Can you let it go, ma'am?

04:11.751 --> 04:13.544
I've had kind of a bad day.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.421
The lady told you to put that out.

04:15.505 --> 04:16.631
You got a problem?

04:20.843 --> 04:22.220
Yes, I do!

04:22.345 --> 04:23.805
I need my smoke!

04:23.888 --> 04:26.307
So, no, sir, I will not put this out.

04:28.059 --> 04:31.271
I am a powerful, functional adult
at the peak of his life,

04:31.354 --> 04:32.647
who demands to be heard!

04:32.730 --> 04:36.234
My voice is a flame that cannot
be extinguished!

04:38.695 --> 04:42.031
Give me smoking, or give me death!

04:43.700 --> 04:44.617
Ha!

04:50.832 --> 04:52.208
Jenkins here.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.085
At the Waffle House, eh?

04:54.168 --> 04:58.298
Hmm. Let me see if this pony has legs.

04:59.716 --> 05:01.801
<i>Oh! Damn that Bob Jenkins!</i>

05:01.884 --> 05:02.927
Listen to this.

05:03.011 --> 05:05.680
"Smoking Bandit Lights Up Controversy."

05:05.763 --> 05:08.266
"Smoking Bandit"? What's that mean?

05:08.349 --> 05:10.351
"A mysterious man of menthol

05:10.435 --> 05:12.770
has declared a 'Battle of the Butts,'

05:12.854 --> 05:14.731
standing up for the smoking community

05:14.814 --> 05:18.026
in a defiant yakety-yakety,
around 9:00 p.m. last night..."

05:19.027 --> 05:20.320
At the Waffle House!

05:20.403 --> 05:22.196
That is my beat, the thief!

05:22.280 --> 05:23.197
Nine o'clock?

05:23.281 --> 05:26.034
Hey, isn't that about the time
you were eating waffles here?

05:30.371 --> 05:31.331
Get this, shugs.

05:31.414 --> 05:33.916
"And the sheriff vows
to prosecute this rogue,

05:34.000 --> 05:35.543
to the fullest extent of the law."

05:35.626 --> 05:36.627
Wow.

05:36.711 --> 05:39.380
The... the fullest extent of the law?

05:39.464 --> 05:41.549
Mm-hmm. That's what the sheriff vows.

05:41.632 --> 05:43.760
But our extent is pretty full.

05:43.843 --> 05:45.553
We have a death penalty in this state.

05:45.636 --> 05:47.180
And we're not afraid to use it.

05:47.263 --> 05:48.431
Can you imagine, shug?

05:48.514 --> 05:50.892
Whoever this cowboy is,
he's in a lot of hot water.

05:50.975 --> 05:53.644
Well, not yet. I mean,
no one took his picture, right?

05:53.728 --> 05:55.813
Or did they? Did they...
Did they get a description?

05:55.897 --> 05:56.814
Let's see...

05:56.898 --> 06:02.028
"Only that he was as slim and white
as the cigarette he so boldly enjoyed."

06:04.655 --> 06:06.783
Gaah! What have I done?

06:06.866 --> 06:09.535
I've really Gribbled myself this time!

06:09.619 --> 06:11.746
Don't you stare at me like that!

06:11.829 --> 06:13.414
This is more heat than I can handle.

06:13.498 --> 06:15.291
Okay, stay calm.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.376
Just burn the evidence.

06:16.459 --> 06:17.585
You've done it before.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.921
Ah, that's better.

06:20.004 --> 06:21.047
No. No, no!

06:21.130 --> 06:22.632
Wrong, wrong, wrong!

06:22.715 --> 06:25.968
We'll just... destroy
the evidence another way.

06:31.349 --> 06:33.434
No one will suspect Dale Gribble

06:33.518 --> 06:35.561
if Dale Gribble isn't a smoker.

06:35.645 --> 06:36.687
Genius.

06:37.230 --> 06:41.734
See? That's why I'm out here,
and you're the ones in the tank.

06:45.613 --> 06:46.447
Yep.

06:46.531 --> 06:47.532
Morning, Bill.

06:47.615 --> 06:49.450
Just taking out some garbage

06:49.534 --> 06:51.828
as per my usual routine.

06:51.911 --> 06:52.787
Yup.

06:52.870 --> 06:54.205
Morning, boys.

06:54.288 --> 06:55.665
-Morning, Mr. Gribble.
-Hey, Dad.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.875
Nothing to see here, boys. Carry on.

06:57.959 --> 06:59.627
You wanna melt some Legos?

06:59.710 --> 07:00.878
Eh, maybe.

07:00.962 --> 07:02.255
There's a cool thing in the paper

07:02.338 --> 07:04.090
about this Smoking Bandit guy.

07:04.173 --> 07:05.633
Yeah, I heard about that.

07:05.716 --> 07:07.135
He sounded so cool.

07:07.218 --> 07:09.804
He doesn't let the Waffle House
tell him how to live his life.

07:09.887 --> 07:11.806
So, you really look up to him?

07:11.889 --> 07:13.433
This Bandit fellow?

07:13.516 --> 07:14.559
Oh, you're still here?

07:16.269 --> 07:20.064
I just realized
there's something important in here

07:20.148 --> 07:21.858
that's needed back at the house.

07:23.734 --> 07:25.027
See you later, Joseph.

07:25.736 --> 07:28.322
Your Dad can be kind of weird sometimes.

07:28.406 --> 07:29.449
Yeah.

07:29.532 --> 07:31.701
Let's go spit into some ant holes.

08:01.397 --> 08:02.899
Welcome to Attaché.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.192
Do you have a reservation?

08:04.275 --> 08:06.319
Oh... I'll just be at the bar.

08:09.405 --> 08:10.656
Evening. What can I get you?

08:10.740 --> 08:12.241
How about...

08:12.325 --> 08:14.535
an ashtray, my good man?

08:14.619 --> 08:16.037
Hey! You can't do that in here!

08:21.000 --> 08:22.210
Can't do what?

08:22.293 --> 08:25.880
Savor the fresh, smoky air
of sweet liberty?

08:25.963 --> 08:26.923
Go ahead.

08:27.006 --> 08:29.217
Sick your storm-troopers on me.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.385
Of course, average police response time

08:31.469 --> 08:32.887
is roughly 28 minutes,

08:32.970 --> 08:35.890
while I am done in less than three.

08:35.973 --> 08:37.141
Hmm.

08:37.225 --> 08:39.101
I am the Smoking Bandit!

08:39.185 --> 08:42.146
See you in the history books, people.

08:46.317 --> 08:48.778
This is strictly a denim-and-leather bar.

08:48.861 --> 08:51.197
You need to be wearing
both denim and leather.

08:51.280 --> 08:54.784
Gentlemen, I truly regret
not meeting your dress code.

08:54.867 --> 08:57.995
But I can't say I am sorry about this.

08:58.079 --> 08:59.288
Oh!

09:09.215 --> 09:10.466
-Wow.
-Oh, yeah.

09:12.468 --> 09:13.511
Yep.

09:13.594 --> 09:14.470
Yup.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.431
Bill, get that dang cigarette
out of your mouth.

09:17.515 --> 09:18.724
I'm not smoking it.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.017
I just like the look.

09:20.101 --> 09:22.186
I'm told it's very "bandit."

09:22.270 --> 09:26.315
All I can say is, I wish I had
the Smoking Bandit's courage.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.526
He's the Rosa Parks of nicotine.

09:28.609 --> 09:30.486
He's a hero, just like the guy

09:30.611 --> 09:32.780
who rides his bicycle
faster than French people.

09:32.863 --> 09:34.156
I bet he smokes, too.

09:34.240 --> 09:37.076
No. The Bandit's just a jackass, Bill.

09:37.159 --> 09:38.578
And he's breaking the law.

09:38.661 --> 09:39.912
Did you forget about that?

09:40.955 --> 09:43.833
Why do people idolize
these bad-boy idiots?

09:43.916 --> 09:45.585
Well, you know, man, some of them...

09:45.668 --> 09:47.878
Talkin' 'bout
that dang ol', mysterious charm, whatever.

09:48.129 --> 09:50.339
You know, I... I have no idea, man.

09:50.423 --> 09:51.924
People just got no sense, man.

09:52.008 --> 09:52.842
It's a dang ol' fact.

09:52.925 --> 09:55.136
Exactly. You can't pick and choose

09:55.219 --> 09:56.971
what laws you wanna obey.

09:57.054 --> 09:59.140
Sure, I'd like to tape a baseball game

09:59.223 --> 10:01.100
without the express written consent

10:01.183 --> 10:02.602
of Major League Baseball,

10:02.685 --> 10:04.520
but that's just not the way it works.

10:05.104 --> 10:06.772
Hello, Joseph. How's it going?

10:06.856 --> 10:09.358
Did you hear?
The Smoking Bandit struck again.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.819
They say he stopped
a Shoney's from getting robbed,

10:11.902 --> 10:13.321
then he smoked in it!

10:24.624 --> 10:25.708
Hey, Joseph.

10:25.791 --> 10:28.002
So, that Bandit's pretty cool, huh?

10:28.085 --> 10:30.087
I bet you'd like a dad like that.

10:30.171 --> 10:31.881
Yeah, but... uh...

10:32.465 --> 10:36.260
So... what if I were to tell you
I was the Bandit?

10:36.344 --> 10:37.970
Yeah, right.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.805
What if I told you I was an elephant?

10:39.889 --> 10:41.140
No, really, I am.

10:43.392 --> 10:44.477
See?

10:44.560 --> 10:45.645
Wow...

10:46.187 --> 10:48.564
You just made smoking seem uncool.

10:50.399 --> 10:52.360
Well, it's late.

10:52.443 --> 10:54.195
You should start getting ready for bed.

10:54.278 --> 10:56.030
Nah, I'm gonna go watch TV.

10:58.949 --> 11:00.826
I bet he'd listen to you.

11:06.165 --> 11:07.583
Need to talk.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.001
Are you serious?

11:09.085 --> 11:10.127
In a minute.

11:10.211 --> 11:12.296
Well, give me the details, man.

11:12.380 --> 11:13.798
Manners!

11:13.881 --> 11:16.133
The Waffle House was my beat, Jenkins.

11:16.217 --> 11:19.220
The Bandit is my story, and I want it!

11:19.303 --> 11:21.806
Ah, Peggy, I feel terrible.

11:21.889 --> 11:24.100
I'll tell you where
the bandit will strike next...

11:24.183 --> 11:25.351
Oh!

11:25.935 --> 11:27.478
Channel 84.

11:27.561 --> 11:29.146
He sent in a tape.

11:29.230 --> 11:31.774
Some sort of video manifesto.

11:33.484 --> 11:36.445
They always leave us for television.

11:37.113 --> 11:39.240
I am not giving up on this.

11:39.782 --> 11:40.741
Well, I am.

11:44.495 --> 11:46.122
<i>And we have just received a tape</i>

11:46.205 --> 11:49.250
<i>from Arlen's notorious Smoking Bandit.</i>

11:49.333 --> 11:52.628
Your hero the bandit
is on TV with an important message.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.339
Let's watch it together,
as father and son.

11:55.423 --> 11:57.299
Dad. Hand.

11:57.383 --> 11:59.510
<i>The Bandit has apparently
scrambled his voice</i>

11:59.593 --> 12:01.053
<i>to conceal his identity.</i>

12:01.595 --> 12:05.933


12:06.016 --> 12:07.852
Oh, I don't understand him.

12:07.935 --> 12:09.562
Uh, it's clear as day.

12:09.645 --> 12:13.232
"It's cool to respect your dad
and like him."

12:13.315 --> 12:15.735


12:15.818 --> 12:18.696
Now he's saying,
"Real rebels are the rebels

12:18.779 --> 12:20.364
who obey their fathers."

12:20.448 --> 12:21.282
Yeah.

12:28.456 --> 12:31.500
Look at me, I'm the Celery Bandit.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.377
Dude, you're missing the message.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.463
You're not like the Bandit when you smoke.

12:35.546 --> 12:38.257
You're like him when you break the law
and run away.

12:38.340 --> 12:39.467
I'm listening.

12:39.550 --> 12:40.760
He fights back.

12:40.843 --> 12:43.888
He disobeys unfair stuff,
like, like homework,

12:43.971 --> 12:45.347
and... and math tests,

12:45.431 --> 12:47.933
and girls who tell other girls
that I'm a dork.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.810
Math is so unfair!

12:49.894 --> 12:52.897
How are kids like us supposed
to know all those answers?

12:52.980 --> 12:54.565
Yeah. No one has the right

12:54.648 --> 12:56.442
to teach us stuff we don't wanna learn.

12:56.525 --> 12:59.195
That's what our Bill of Constitution's
all about!

13:05.367 --> 13:07.578
Okay, books away for the quiz.

13:07.661 --> 13:09.497
Take one and hand the rest back.

13:10.289 --> 13:11.290
Bobby? Joseph?

13:11.373 --> 13:12.249
Did you two hear me?

13:12.333 --> 13:14.376
We're not giving out your stupid quiz.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.421
Yeah! We're the Math Quiz Bandits!

13:17.505 --> 13:18.714
Uh, no.

13:18.839 --> 13:20.716
How it works is, you take one,

13:20.800 --> 13:22.092
and then pass the rest back.

13:22.176 --> 13:25.429
Quizzes are unfair
to kids who don't like math!

13:25.513 --> 13:28.098
Yeah! You take your stupid quiz!

13:37.566 --> 13:40.402
Okay... now what?

13:40.486 --> 13:41.737
Goddangit, mister!

13:41.821 --> 13:43.989
You're gonna explain yourself this minute!

13:46.158 --> 13:47.827
Look at me when I'm talking to you!

13:47.910 --> 13:49.245
You see this, Hank?

13:49.328 --> 13:51.288
I can't have them spreading
this "Bandit" nonsense

13:51.372 --> 13:52.873
to the rest of the kids.

13:52.957 --> 13:54.250
They're suspended.

13:57.211 --> 13:59.505
It's that dang Smoking Bandit idiot.

13:59.588 --> 14:01.006
He's a bad influence!

14:01.090 --> 14:01.924
Yeah.

14:02.007 --> 14:05.177
The Bandit is making
my own son defy me even more.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.512
It's pretty ironic.

14:06.595 --> 14:07.972
How is that ironic?

14:08.055 --> 14:09.056
Oh, well, uh...

14:09.139 --> 14:12.226
I'm probably just
misusing the word ironic,

14:12.309 --> 14:13.894
as people so often do.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.729
You know what? For our kids' sake,

14:15.813 --> 14:18.399
the two of us have
to hunt this jackass down

14:18.482 --> 14:20.025
and turn him over to the authorities.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.527
Hmm...

14:21.610 --> 14:23.612
Yeah, this week is a little busy for me.

14:23.696 --> 14:26.073
You want Joseph to look up to you, right?

14:26.156 --> 14:27.449
Well, bringing in the Bandit

14:27.533 --> 14:29.827
is how you're gonna earn
your son's respect.

14:29.910 --> 14:31.287
Uh... of course.

14:31.370 --> 14:34.540
I... I can't wait to see
the look on his face.

14:39.795 --> 14:42.131
You know, I don't really see why

14:42.214 --> 14:44.091
we have to go after the Bandit.

14:44.174 --> 14:45.426
This is one of those things

14:45.509 --> 14:47.845
that's funner to talk about
than actually do.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.103
That is why we're going after this guy.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.439
Where are you boys off to?

14:58.522 --> 15:00.441
To catch the Bandit.

15:00.524 --> 15:02.192
Oh, I started some fresh ice,

15:02.276 --> 15:03.944
so don't jostle the trays.

15:07.781 --> 15:08.824
Roddy Rae?

15:08.908 --> 15:10.159
Hold the front page!

15:10.242 --> 15:14.121
Headline. "Peggy Hill Captures
Smoking Bandit!"

15:14.872 --> 15:16.040
Well, no, not yet.

15:16.123 --> 15:17.833
Well, I have to capture him first.

15:22.129 --> 15:24.423
I can't believe we'll get
to meet the bandit!

15:24.506 --> 15:27.426
Do you think he's a match man
or a lighter man?

15:27.509 --> 15:28.719
If he beats up our dads,

15:28.802 --> 15:30.137
do you think he'll let us live with him?

15:30.220 --> 15:31.764
Sure, he's a hero to you now,

15:31.847 --> 15:34.391
but when we rip that cigarette
out of that guy's mouth,

15:34.475 --> 15:36.143
he'll probably stick his thumb in it.

15:36.226 --> 15:37.102
Right, Dale?

15:41.315 --> 15:42.149
Okay.

15:42.232 --> 15:43.525
Here's Attaché.

15:43.609 --> 15:44.485
Let's get started.

15:44.568 --> 15:46.862
But that was one
of the Bandit's first strikes.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.697
You think he's likely to repeat himself?

15:48.781 --> 15:50.240
Don't they say criminals

15:50.324 --> 15:52.284
always return to the scene of the crime?

15:52.368 --> 15:54.870
Uh, not if they don't wanna
get caught, Hank.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.372
What do you think we should do?

15:56.455 --> 15:58.916
Well, if you study the Bandit's hits,

15:59.041 --> 16:02.544
he strikes north to south
in a childish grid formation,

16:02.628 --> 16:04.964
so we should try... there.

16:08.676 --> 16:09.843
Yo.

16:09.927 --> 16:12.096
Can't let you in wearing work boots.

16:15.307 --> 16:17.643
That's why I wear black patent leather

16:17.726 --> 16:19.603
rubber-soled watchmen's oxfords.

16:19.687 --> 16:21.605
Classy, easy to run in,

16:21.689 --> 16:22.815
and they satisfy all

16:22.898 --> 16:25.067
but the most discriminating of doormen.

16:25.150 --> 16:28.195
Huh. You know a lot about bars and shoes.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.701
Okay, now we move deeper into the night.

16:33.784 --> 16:35.577
Everyone put on your leather work gloves,

16:35.661 --> 16:36.704
in case he's a biter.

16:37.371 --> 16:40.666
Hey, your dad hunts people like animals.

16:40.749 --> 16:42.710
Yeah. Cool.

16:51.510 --> 16:52.886
Your name's not on the list.

16:52.970 --> 16:55.389
Excuse me, you do not know my name.

16:55.472 --> 16:56.890
Okay, what's your name?

16:56.974 --> 16:59.268
Peggy Hill, Arlen Bystander.

16:59.351 --> 17:00.436
Not on the list.

17:00.519 --> 17:02.146
So, it's like that?

17:02.229 --> 17:04.148
All right, mister, I lied.

17:04.231 --> 17:06.734
My name is Anna Beth Fitzwater.

17:06.817 --> 17:08.527
Go on, check the list.

17:08.610 --> 17:09.653
You're not on it.

17:09.737 --> 17:10.571
Fine.

17:10.654 --> 17:13.282
I'm really Professor Helen Marriot Booth,

17:13.365 --> 17:14.908
and I've got all night.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.831
Okay, kids, let's assess.

17:20.914 --> 17:23.459
The Bandit wants his smoking
to be noticed.

17:23.542 --> 17:26.420
That club's dance floor
has a smoke machine.

17:26.503 --> 17:28.172
Would the Bandit strike there?

17:28.255 --> 17:29.173
No, sir.

17:29.256 --> 17:31.008
He'd go somewhere more...

17:31.133 --> 17:32.426
somewhere else.

17:33.552 --> 17:34.678
Smart lad.

17:34.762 --> 17:37.890
So, do we move down the street
in formation, or not?

17:37.973 --> 17:41.810
Um... I, I, I think, uh... no?

17:41.894 --> 17:42.811
Exactly!

17:42.895 --> 17:45.606
Because we don't wanna look like
we're searching for him.

17:45.689 --> 17:46.732
What should we do?

17:47.441 --> 17:50.110
You want me to tell you what to do...

17:50.194 --> 17:51.737
so you can do it?

17:51.820 --> 17:52.988
Well, yeah, dude.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.323
I mean, Dad.

17:55.616 --> 17:57.910
Uh... give me a second. I...

17:57.993 --> 18:01.580
I think I just got a bottle cap in my eye.

18:02.331 --> 18:03.540
All right.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.042
What do you say we call it a night?

18:05.125 --> 18:07.252
But I still wanna meet the Bandit!

18:07.336 --> 18:09.213
Yeah, I wanna see him get his smoke on.

18:12.633 --> 18:15.385
Look, Dale, I know Joseph
is acting right tonight,

18:15.469 --> 18:17.346
but he still idolizes this guy.

18:17.429 --> 18:18.680
If we don't finish this job,

18:18.764 --> 18:21.225
you're gonna be right back
to where you were last week.

18:21.308 --> 18:23.977
Stuck outside my own bathroom.

18:24.311 --> 18:26.522
But catching this guy is gonna be hard.

18:28.232 --> 18:30.317
Or maybe not.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.069
Tell you what: I'm gonna head in there,

18:32.152 --> 18:33.529
on a scouting mission.

18:33.612 --> 18:35.405
Son, hold these for me.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.326
You guys meet me in the alley.

18:46.875 --> 18:48.669
Hello? Anyone here?

18:49.419 --> 18:50.504
No.

18:52.381 --> 18:53.382
Perfect.

19:01.682 --> 19:02.933
Hank, quick!

19:03.016 --> 19:04.643
I found the Bandit!

19:06.186 --> 19:08.355
He dropped this, then fled into the john.

19:08.438 --> 19:09.773
I'm going in.

19:09.857 --> 19:11.233
Kids, guard the door.

19:11.316 --> 19:13.735
Hank, make sure that bartender
doesn't butt in.

19:14.444 --> 19:15.654
Be careful, Dad.

19:18.532 --> 19:21.076
Okay, Bandit... freeze!

19:23.412 --> 19:24.413
Oh, yeah?

19:25.789 --> 19:27.040
Take that!

19:31.086 --> 19:33.338
I caught him wriggling out the window.

19:33.422 --> 19:35.299
He's kind of pitiful.

19:35.382 --> 19:37.009
Maybe we should let him go.

19:37.092 --> 19:37.968
No way!

19:38.051 --> 19:39.553
Hey, let's give him a swirly!

19:39.636 --> 19:41.180
Let's give him an atomic wedgie!

19:41.263 --> 19:42.181
Or let him go.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.641
Dangit, Dale, the whole point
of coming out here

19:44.725 --> 19:48.103
was to show the boys
this guy's sniveling, frightened face.

19:54.610 --> 19:57.154
Uh... uh, yeah.

19:57.237 --> 20:00.490
Well, maybe we, uh, maybe we
should let the Bandit go.

20:01.575 --> 20:03.327
But does the Bandit swear

20:03.410 --> 20:07.331
that he will never, ever do
anything this asinine again

20:07.414 --> 20:09.041
or I will kick his ass?

20:09.124 --> 20:10.626
Hold on, I'll ask him.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.586
Bandit, do you understand,

20:12.669 --> 20:14.254
so on and so forth?

20:15.005 --> 20:16.340
He's nodding in agreement.

20:17.674 --> 20:19.092
Go on! Git!

20:19.176 --> 20:22.137
Aw, quit your crying and just scram.

20:23.180 --> 20:25.349
The Bandit is gone. For good.

20:25.432 --> 20:28.268
To make sure, I confiscated his cigs.

20:28.352 --> 20:31.438
I can't believe I thought
the Bandit was cool.

20:31.521 --> 20:32.856
You know who's cool?

20:32.940 --> 20:35.359
That rapper with the bullet in his nose.

20:35.442 --> 20:36.485
Bullet Nose!

20:36.568 --> 20:39.321
Yeah, one wrong sneeze
and the whole joint goes up.

20:39.404 --> 20:41.865
The bullets will still
be there tomorrow, kids.

20:41.949 --> 20:43.742
But right now, it's bedtime.

20:43.825 --> 20:45.077
After flossing

20:45.160 --> 20:47.037
and eating your vegetables.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.372
-Okay.
-Sure, Dad.

20:53.418 --> 20:55.337
Priscilla Pemelman.

20:55.420 --> 20:57.047
These kids are getting antsy.

20:57.130 --> 20:59.299
Not on the list.

20:59.383 --> 21:00.884
Constance Keegan.

21:00.968 --> 21:01.927
No.

21:02.511 --> 21:05.514
Elizabeth Sangwood Thatherton
Millicent "Millie"

21:05.597 --> 21:07.891
Mitchell-Waterburg, Duchess of--

21:07.975 --> 21:09.935
Fine. Twelve-dollar cover.

21:11.353 --> 21:13.981
-Oh. I don't have any money.
-Oh...

21:51.310 --> 21:53.895
-<i>See you
in the history books, people.</i>
