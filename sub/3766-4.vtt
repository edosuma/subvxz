WEBVTT

00:02.170 --> 00:04.638
CASSIE: Previously
on Good Witch.

00:04.672 --> 00:06.440
I have big plans for this year

00:06.474 --> 00:09.443
and they all start and end
on the success
of the Heritage Festival.

00:10.111 --> 00:12.080
-Annie is back.
-Oh.

00:12.113 --> 00:14.215
-What game?
-The game that
you've been winning

00:14.248 --> 00:16.217
and I've been losing
ever since the divorce.

00:16.250 --> 00:18.519
JOHN: Her real name's Heather.
She is my granddaughter.

00:18.552 --> 00:20.988
Where will you go?
Leaving is a mistake.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.022
I've made a lot of those.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.332
There you are.

00:31.365 --> 00:34.135
-I have a bone
to pick with you.
-(SIGHS)

00:34.168 --> 00:35.903
Where's my starter's pistol?

00:35.936 --> 00:38.106
Retired. Permanently.

00:38.139 --> 00:40.641
I'm not leading a band.
I want my gun.

00:40.674 --> 00:42.943
I don't think anybody
wants a repeat of last year.

00:42.976 --> 00:45.813
-I didn't know it was loaded.
-With blanks, thankfully.

00:45.846 --> 00:49.383
I scared myself
way more than I scared
that silly scouting troop.

00:49.417 --> 00:51.085
(CHUCKLES) Whistle.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.388
Well, I suppose
I'll just have to make do.

00:54.422 --> 00:56.324
Have a nice night,
Madam Mayor.

00:59.460 --> 01:00.494
(BLOWING SOFTLY)

01:00.528 --> 01:02.062
Ooh!

01:02.096 --> 01:03.797
(WHISTLE BLOWING LOUDLY)

01:05.499 --> 01:07.368
-Refill?
-(SCOFFS) Uh, no.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.703
If I have any more,
I won't sleep all week.

01:10.904 --> 01:11.905
Thanks.

01:13.107 --> 01:14.208
We need to talk.

01:15.876 --> 01:19.079
-Gary Zimmerman.
-He's a Federal Prosecutor.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.535
Mr. Beamish.

01:41.569 --> 01:43.237
I really didn't want
to bother anyone.

01:43.271 --> 01:45.173
I think you're probably
pretty bothered yourself.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.909
-That's why I'm leaving.
-Before the race?

01:48.942 --> 01:50.311
If I had known that Heather...

01:50.344 --> 01:53.414
Ashley was in Middleton,
I never would have come.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.015
(SIGHS)

01:55.048 --> 01:57.885
I don't want to upset her.
I don't want to cause her
the trouble.

01:58.686 --> 01:59.820
She's gone.

02:01.222 --> 02:04.024
-Because of me?
-No. (INHALES DEEPLY)

02:04.057 --> 02:06.827
Unfortunately, she's got
troubles of her own.

02:10.097 --> 02:12.266
So Ashley isn't Ashley,

02:12.300 --> 02:14.802
she's Heather,
and she's on the run?

02:14.835 --> 02:17.137
Her fiance was
laundering money.

02:17.171 --> 02:19.273
And once she found out
what he was up to,

02:19.307 --> 02:21.609
she agreed to
testify against him,

02:21.642 --> 02:23.477
but then got scared
and came here.

02:23.511 --> 02:25.813
I'm pretty sure that
her fiance got to her.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.616
-Ashley?
-Yup.

02:31.385 --> 02:32.386
(SIGHS)

02:35.022 --> 02:37.191
What kind of trouble
is she in?

02:37.225 --> 02:39.360
Hmm, well,
she's running from her past

02:39.393 --> 02:41.662
and there are some people
after her.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.564
But my stepson
is a police officer

02:43.597 --> 02:45.433
and he's out looking
for her right now.

02:45.466 --> 02:49.036
Before she was born,
I cut her mother off.

02:49.069 --> 02:51.305
Her mother was dating
a man I didn't approve of.

02:51.339 --> 02:53.474
She moved in with him,
got pregnant.

02:53.507 --> 02:56.410
I told her to come home,
she refused to leave him.

02:56.444 --> 02:58.812
I came here to fulfill
a promise to my wife

02:58.846 --> 03:00.748
and look what I've opened up.

03:00.781 --> 03:03.150
But maybe being here
with Ashley gives you a chance

03:03.183 --> 03:05.219
to fulfill a different promise
to your wife.

03:05.253 --> 03:06.354
Hmm.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.956
I should go.

03:08.989 --> 03:12.393
Can I leave this with you?
In case she comes back?

03:12.426 --> 03:14.562
It's just money.
I want her to have it.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.165
I... I think you'll find
someone in need

03:18.198 --> 03:20.468
to give it to
on your journey home.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.774
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

03:48.161 --> 03:49.229
(INDISTINCT)

03:49.263 --> 03:51.565
WOMAN: The race starts
in 30 minutes!

03:53.200 --> 03:54.368
More carbs?

03:54.402 --> 03:55.503
The best thing about running

03:55.536 --> 03:57.405
-is eating.
-(CHUCKLES)

03:57.438 --> 03:58.472
How about you?

03:58.506 --> 03:59.773
Oh, I've given up running,

03:59.807 --> 04:01.342
remember? (CHUCKLES)

04:03.110 --> 04:04.144
But I haven't

04:04.177 --> 04:05.413
given up dancing.

04:05.446 --> 04:07.047
Ah, good to know.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.683
So, are you going to the ball?

04:09.717 --> 04:11.419
Hadn't given it much thought.

04:11.452 --> 04:12.520
You?

04:12.553 --> 04:14.355
I'm catering it.

04:14.388 --> 04:16.123
The whole town's
gonna be there.

04:16.156 --> 04:17.925
Well, I'm told that
I should mingle

04:17.958 --> 04:19.527
more with my fellow citizens.

04:19.560 --> 04:20.594
Mingling is good.

04:20.628 --> 04:21.729
You know, I have to say,

04:21.762 --> 04:22.796
I lived in the same building

04:22.830 --> 04:23.897
in New York for 15 years

04:23.931 --> 04:24.965
and I'd be hard-pressed

04:24.998 --> 04:26.033
to pick any of my neighbors

04:26.066 --> 04:27.901
-out of a line-up.
-(CHUCKLES)

04:27.935 --> 04:30.037
Not a lot of mingling
in New York, huh?

04:30.070 --> 04:31.905
Not on purpose, no.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.774
So, does this mean
I will see you, or...

04:34.842 --> 04:36.377
You just might.

04:38.712 --> 04:39.747
Thanks.

04:41.549 --> 04:43.584
(EXHALING CONTINUOUSLY)

04:45.619 --> 04:46.654
You okay?

04:46.687 --> 04:49.056
Yeah, I'm just, uh,
psyching myself up.

04:49.089 --> 04:50.157
Oh, good.

04:50.190 --> 04:51.224
I thought you had asthma.

04:51.258 --> 04:52.259
(EXHALES)

04:53.260 --> 04:54.495
-Uh, beet juice?
-Hey.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.398
-Is that a dare?
-(CHUCKLES)

04:57.431 --> 04:59.933
Beets are an excellent
source of inorganic nitrates

04:59.967 --> 05:01.502
which supply blood flow
to the muscles,

05:01.535 --> 05:03.337
but, of course, you already
knew that, didn't you?

05:03.371 --> 05:06.940
I don't need beets,
just skill and hard work.

05:06.974 --> 05:09.810
Hmm, I think everyone
could use a little extra help.

05:11.211 --> 05:13.447
I think you're right.

05:13.481 --> 05:15.516
-(SCOFFS)
-I love your beet juice.

05:15.549 --> 05:17.217
Thank you, Cassie.

05:18.218 --> 05:19.887
And you are going down.

05:21.121 --> 05:22.222
Hmm!

05:28.061 --> 05:29.597
Something I said?

05:29.630 --> 05:31.832
No, someone he saw.

05:31.865 --> 05:34.301
-Who?
-(WHISPERS) Annie.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.904
-Who's that?
-His ex-fiancee.

05:36.937 --> 05:39.239
-Who's the guy with her?
-Oh, uh, that would be Mark,

05:39.272 --> 05:43.110
his ex-best friend,
um, Annie's husband.

05:43.143 --> 05:44.845
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

05:49.783 --> 05:51.719
I put Ashley's description
out on the wire.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.587
I've got the county sheriff
looking as well

05:53.621 --> 05:56.490
and obviously my men
are keeping their eyes open.

05:56.524 --> 05:58.526
I've got the Marshals Service
helping, too.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.661
I hope we can find her
before her fiance does

06:00.694 --> 06:02.696
and I can get her to testify.

06:02.730 --> 06:05.065
Putting her ex behind bars
is the safest thing for her.

06:05.098 --> 06:06.199
Yeah.

06:07.668 --> 06:08.702
(SIGHS)

06:15.976 --> 06:17.645
Missed you at the race.

06:17.678 --> 06:18.712
Nick!

06:21.114 --> 06:22.883
Dad, please.

06:22.916 --> 06:25.052
-What are you doing?
-Trying to remember

06:25.085 --> 06:26.520
what video games are like.

06:27.655 --> 06:29.423
I think you love that XBox
more than me.

06:29.457 --> 06:31.992
(CHUCKLES)
Don't make me choose.

06:32.025 --> 06:33.594
Come on.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.429
What do you want me to do
for entertainment?

06:36.530 --> 06:38.365
-Come to the ball with me.
-Ball?

06:38.398 --> 06:41.201
(CHUCKLES)
The whole town will be there.

06:41.234 --> 06:44.371
-I don't dance.
-Well, just come, hang out.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.674
If I go, will you give me
my stuff back?

06:46.707 --> 06:48.776
-No.
-Then have a good time.

07:00.220 --> 07:01.221
Hi.

07:03.323 --> 07:04.458
Hey.

07:04.492 --> 07:06.359
I just feel like being alone,
thanks.

07:06.393 --> 07:07.394
Okay.

07:13.601 --> 07:15.235
(SCOFFS)

07:15.268 --> 07:18.105
I'm sorry about the race.

07:18.138 --> 07:21.108
I think we both know
that's not what this is about.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.076
I take it you didn't know
they were coming?

07:23.110 --> 07:24.678
Ah, no!

07:25.913 --> 07:27.147
And you know
what I can't stand?

07:27.180 --> 07:29.416
That she still gets to me
and he still gets to me.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.118
(SIGHS)

07:31.151 --> 07:33.887
It takes a lot of energy
to stay angry.

07:33.921 --> 07:35.723
That's interesting.

07:35.756 --> 07:37.424
Doesn't change how I feel.

07:38.959 --> 07:42.129
I know that you can
always forgive people,

07:42.162 --> 07:45.265
but for me, there's a limit.
(SIGHS)

07:45.298 --> 07:46.667
Maybe it's time

07:46.700 --> 07:48.401
-to change tactics.
-Yeah.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.103
(SCOFFS)

07:50.904 --> 07:51.905
Okay.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.809
What are you suggesting?

07:55.843 --> 07:57.978
-Forgive.
-You're kidding me.

08:00.047 --> 08:02.516
No. No way.

08:02.550 --> 08:04.718
I'm sorry, Cassie, but you're
wrong about this one.

08:16.229 --> 08:19.232
I hear congratulations
are in order.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.234
I won.

08:21.268 --> 08:23.704
Ryan came in second.

08:23.737 --> 08:26.840
He didn't have his mind
on the race.

08:26.874 --> 08:30.578
His fiancee took off
with his best friend.

08:30.611 --> 08:32.279
Wow, that's rough!

08:32.312 --> 08:34.682
Yeah, but anger isn't healthy.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.516
-Yes, it is.
-No, it's not.

08:36.550 --> 08:39.086
Sometimes, anger is all
that gets you out of bed
in the morning.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.889
But you wouldn't understand.

08:41.922 --> 08:43.056
Excuse me?

08:43.090 --> 08:44.491
You're one of those, um,

08:44.524 --> 08:47.260
"turn the other cheek" people,
I can tell.

08:47.294 --> 08:49.763
Well, forgiveness isn't about
the person who hurt you,

08:49.797 --> 08:53.233
it's about you and moving on.
Hate traps you in the past.

08:54.134 --> 08:56.003
Yeah, well,
you've never been...

08:56.036 --> 08:57.037
Never been what?

08:57.938 --> 08:59.807
(SCOFFS) Cheated on.

09:00.674 --> 09:03.276
Ah, but you have.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.913
Well, it wasn't my best friend
or anything.

09:05.946 --> 09:07.881
My wife's Pilates instructor.

09:07.915 --> 09:08.949
I should have known.

09:08.982 --> 09:10.050
She was always
going to the gym,

09:10.083 --> 09:12.586
but she was in horrible shape.

09:12.620 --> 09:15.689
-And you never forgave her?
-No. I divorced her.

09:20.093 --> 09:21.929
Well, I have some work to do

09:21.962 --> 09:24.164
at the clinic. Um,

09:24.197 --> 09:26.099
-see you tonight?
-Yeah.

09:38.378 --> 09:40.113
-Hi.
-Hi!

09:40.147 --> 09:41.214
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

09:41.248 --> 09:43.684
Amber! (CHUCKLES)

09:43.717 --> 09:45.452
You wanna hang out?

09:46.654 --> 09:48.622
With me?

09:48.656 --> 09:50.190
Yeah, silly.

09:50.223 --> 09:51.659
Who else?

09:55.896 --> 09:58.732
Great. Just have a coffee
and I'll be right with you.
Okay.

10:03.771 --> 10:05.505
-Hello.
-Hi.

10:05.538 --> 10:06.606
Can I help you?

10:06.640 --> 10:08.742
Uh, well, actually,
I was just driving by

10:08.776 --> 10:11.144
on my way out of town
and remembered this place.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.683
This is, uh, for your shelter.

10:15.716 --> 10:18.652
-I don't understand.
-I'm making a donation.

10:18.686 --> 10:22.723
Somebody suggested
I might find someone
in need to give it to.

10:22.756 --> 10:25.993
Well, this is incredibly
(CHUCKLES) generous of you.

10:27.494 --> 10:29.596
This'll help a lot of women
in trouble, thank you.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.932
-Okay.
-Uh, don't...

10:36.937 --> 10:38.271
It's okay.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.541
Who are you?

10:41.574 --> 10:43.243
I'm someone
who wants to help you.

10:45.045 --> 10:46.279
Morning.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.584
-Ryan!
-(SIGHS)

10:53.486 --> 10:55.155
Where are you going?

10:59.927 --> 11:03.663
Well, to be frank,
away from you two.

11:03.697 --> 11:06.333
-You're never
gonna forgive me?
-That's not true.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.368
I will never forgive
either one of you.

11:08.401 --> 11:11.138
Come on, isn't there
a statute of limitations

11:11.171 --> 11:13.673
-on this mess between us?
-Yeah.

11:13.707 --> 11:15.843
Now that you're dating Cassie,

11:15.876 --> 11:18.411
don't you wanna just
move beyond all this?

11:18.445 --> 11:19.679
I, uh...

11:20.881 --> 11:25.052
I kind of thought you two
would end up together.

11:25.085 --> 11:28.688
You are together, right?
Or do we have it all wrong?

11:35.095 --> 11:37.931
-Hey, Cassie.
-Hey, Ryan. What's up?

11:39.499 --> 11:41.334
Will you go to the ball
with me?

11:41.368 --> 11:43.436
I don't understand.

11:43.470 --> 11:46.173
I'm asking you to be my date.

11:48.108 --> 11:50.210
-I still don't understand.
-Seriously?

11:50.243 --> 11:51.278
Uh-huh.

11:53.313 --> 11:54.581
Okay, you need to be my date

11:54.614 --> 11:56.850
because Annie and Mark
already think that you are...

11:56.884 --> 11:58.718
Because they think
we are together,

11:58.752 --> 12:00.187
like couple together.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.190
-Why would they think that?
-I don't know.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.491
Because I told her.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.694
-Um...
-It's not totally a lie.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.864
We are together, we're just
not together-together.

12:12.599 --> 12:15.135
-(SIGHS)
-Okay, so I lied.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.270
But I know her, she's just
here to check up on us.

12:17.304 --> 12:20.007
-We're not an "us".
-She thinks we are ever since

12:20.040 --> 12:23.143
she saw us together at that
real estate thingy last week.

12:23.176 --> 12:24.711
Yeah. (CLEARS THROAT)

12:24.744 --> 12:26.079
Okay.

12:26.113 --> 12:29.316
Okay, okay, never mind,
all right?

12:30.550 --> 12:33.320
Argh! Just forget
this conversation.

12:33.353 --> 12:35.488
I plead temporary insanity,

12:35.522 --> 12:38.859
and I will go and tell
Annie the truth.

12:38.892 --> 12:41.228
-Okay.
-I don't know what
I was thinking.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.930
-I'm sorry.
-(CHUCKLES)

12:44.697 --> 12:45.799
Wait.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.769
I do know what I was thinking.

12:50.703 --> 12:53.073
See, Annie is only here

12:53.106 --> 12:55.375
to find out if you and I
are together

12:55.408 --> 12:58.545
and she is hoping
that we are not,

12:58.578 --> 13:00.647
because she likes that
she's happily married

13:00.680 --> 13:02.415
and I'm still single.

13:02.449 --> 13:05.618
In some sick kind of way,
it makes her feel
superior to me.

13:07.687 --> 13:10.557
And that... That is one
among many reasons

13:10.590 --> 13:12.759
that I will never forgive her.

13:12.792 --> 13:13.994
Or them.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.695
-(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
-What?

13:21.801 --> 13:24.204
Ryan tells me
congratulations are in order.

13:26.006 --> 13:29.109
-I guess they are. (CHUCKLES)
-You're together?

13:29.142 --> 13:30.510
-Hmm.
-Together?

13:30.543 --> 13:32.412
-Together.
-Yes.

13:32.445 --> 13:34.481
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

13:34.514 --> 13:35.815
Ah.

13:43.223 --> 13:45.025
Hey, Sam. Come on in.

13:47.227 --> 13:49.796
-I saw you walk up.
-Oh.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.265
So, uh, what can I do for you?

13:52.299 --> 13:54.534
(SIGHS) Nothing.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.904
And yet, here you stand.
(GIGGLES)

13:56.937 --> 14:00.573
I just don't want you to get
the wrong idea about me.

14:00.607 --> 14:02.910
-Wrong idea?
-Earlier.

14:02.943 --> 14:05.112
-Yes.
-I was just saying that I...

14:05.145 --> 14:06.846
I understand how Ryan feels.

14:08.148 --> 14:09.149
Okay.

14:10.017 --> 14:11.284
Don't do that.

14:11.318 --> 14:13.453
-Do what?
-Sound like you agree with me

14:13.486 --> 14:15.155
-when you really don't.
-Sam...

14:15.188 --> 14:18.525
Some things can't be forgiven.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.693
I believe in forgiveness,
you don't.

14:20.727 --> 14:22.162
No, I believe in forgiveness,

14:22.195 --> 14:24.164
it's just some things
are unforgivable!

14:24.197 --> 14:25.732
Forgiveness is like love.

14:25.765 --> 14:28.335
If it isn't unconditional,
it doesn't work.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.403
I wouldn't expect you
to understand.

14:30.437 --> 14:32.672
From what I can gather,
you had a pretty
idyllic marriage.

14:34.007 --> 14:37.277
Yeah, that was ended
by the person who killed Jake.

14:39.079 --> 14:40.213
(SIGHS)

14:40.247 --> 14:42.649
-And you don't hate him?
-I did.

14:42.682 --> 14:44.918
I'm human.

14:44.952 --> 14:47.787
But if I continued to hate,
it would have consumed me

14:47.820 --> 14:49.256
and that's not a way to live.

14:49.722 --> 14:50.723
(DOOR SHUTS)

14:54.527 --> 14:55.595
Hi, Cassie.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.031
I was so worried about you.

14:58.598 --> 14:59.599
I know.

15:10.510 --> 15:13.613
(SIGHS) Well, this is boring.

15:13.646 --> 15:15.882
I have two papers
and a lab due.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.251
This is what it's like
to hang with me.

15:18.285 --> 15:20.187
Well, can we at least
talk about boys?

15:21.588 --> 15:22.789
Which boy?

15:30.697 --> 15:31.999
Hi.

15:32.032 --> 15:33.300
Ask Amber to the dance.

15:34.167 --> 15:36.436
-(SCOFFS)
-Do this and we're even.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.138
Since when are you
friends with Amber?

15:38.838 --> 15:40.373
Believe me, I'm not.

15:40.407 --> 15:42.175
But she's trying
to be friends with me.

15:42.209 --> 15:43.610
Yeah, she's at my house

15:43.643 --> 15:46.179
hoping to "accidentally"
run into you at your house.

15:46.213 --> 15:47.947
I don't like to dance,
I already told her that.

15:47.981 --> 15:50.617
Um, news flash,
she doesn't care.

15:51.918 --> 15:53.553
And who doesn't like to dance?

15:54.054 --> 15:55.055
Me.

15:56.489 --> 15:59.192
You're not any good
at it, are you?

15:59.226 --> 16:00.393
(SCOFFS)

16:00.427 --> 16:02.929
And you don't do anything that
you're not good at, right?

16:02.962 --> 16:05.732
Bye, Grace.
Have a fun time with Amber.

16:05.765 --> 16:06.966
Nick, please!

16:08.135 --> 16:09.502
Okay, I'll teach you!

16:14.307 --> 16:17.544
If I do, this clears
the slate between us?

16:18.311 --> 16:19.746
Yes.

16:19.779 --> 16:20.947
Absolutely.

16:22.349 --> 16:24.217
STEPHANIE: You're going
to the dance with Cassie?

16:24.251 --> 16:27.887
Yes! She's helping me
save face with Mark and Annie.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.289
She's a good friend.

16:34.027 --> 16:35.028
What?

16:36.296 --> 16:37.330
Just for you,

16:37.364 --> 16:39.999
I think there's a little truth
in this big lie.

16:40.633 --> 16:41.734
(SCOFFS)

16:46.873 --> 16:48.908
-Where'd you find her?
-We didn't.

16:48.941 --> 16:50.743
Mr. Beamish did.

16:50.777 --> 16:53.113
She was in a shelter
on the other side of town.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.415
What's the deal
with those two?

16:56.316 --> 16:57.817
Well, if Beamish
didn't tell you,

16:57.850 --> 16:59.286
it's not my news to share.

17:00.653 --> 17:02.122
Will she testify?

17:02.155 --> 17:05.092
She didn't say, but I can tell
she's really scared.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.361
I know everyone's going
to the ball tonight,

17:08.395 --> 17:10.730
but I think I'll stay here,
keep an eye on her.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.567
Won't really be any fun
without Tara anyway.

17:14.601 --> 17:16.836
I know you miss her.

17:16.869 --> 17:17.870
I do.

17:23.776 --> 17:25.044
You have to get off the couch.

17:25.078 --> 17:27.380
Argh, I can't do this.

17:27.414 --> 17:29.382
Nick, come on.

17:29.416 --> 17:32.485
It's not dismantling
a nuclear warhead,

17:32.519 --> 17:34.087
it's a slow dance.

17:37.190 --> 17:40.026
Only it's not, is it?

17:45.965 --> 17:47.934
-Nick, what happened to you?
-I don't wanna talk about it.

17:51.538 --> 17:53.840
You know what?
(CLEARS THROAT)

17:53.873 --> 17:55.275
Let's just forget
about all of this.

17:55.308 --> 17:56.576
I was hit, okay?

17:57.510 --> 18:00.147
You were dancing
and you got hit?

18:01.448 --> 18:02.482
By what?

18:02.515 --> 18:03.916
-Emily.
-(SCOFFS)

18:05.285 --> 18:07.086
You got hit by a girl?

18:09.222 --> 18:12.592
-Wow!
-I was eight, okay?

18:12.625 --> 18:16.663
It was my first dance and...
I said no and she hit me.

18:19.332 --> 18:22.335
I was tortured at school
for like a year.

18:22.369 --> 18:25.004
Seems like you're still
kind of torturing yourself.

18:26.339 --> 18:29.242
And that dancing thing
is just a mental block,

18:29.276 --> 18:31.778
-you need to get past it.
-Why?

18:31.811 --> 18:34.814
Um, so you can take Amber to
the dance and she'll go back

18:34.847 --> 18:37.617
to bothering you and
stop bothering me. (CHUCKLES)

18:38.518 --> 18:40.520
And hey,

18:40.553 --> 18:43.022
I promise that
no one will know

18:43.055 --> 18:45.492
that for a very short time

18:45.525 --> 18:47.294
you doubted your coolness.

18:52.532 --> 18:55.034
-(SONG PLAYING)
-Hmm.

19:06.946 --> 19:09.282
-Wow!
-What?

19:10.517 --> 19:11.951
You are bad.

19:14.387 --> 19:15.388
Let go.

19:22.762 --> 19:23.930
Grace?

19:25.498 --> 19:28.067
Your... Your mom said
you were over here.

19:36.108 --> 19:39.078
It's ruined!
The ball is ruined!

19:39.111 --> 19:40.413
What happened?

19:40.447 --> 19:42.215
They have a gas leak
at the Country Club

19:42.249 --> 19:43.683
and they have to shut
the whole place down.

19:43.716 --> 19:47.287
-Well, okay, don't panic.
-I'm jinxed, Cassie. Jinxed!

19:47.320 --> 19:50.390
Do you have something
to, you know, de-jinx me?

19:50.423 --> 19:52.259
I don't believe
in jinxes, Martha.

19:52.292 --> 19:53.693
Well, then what
do you suggest I do?

19:55.328 --> 19:56.396
Move the ball.

19:57.930 --> 20:00.533
(LAUGHS)
Move the ba... (GASPS)

20:01.934 --> 20:03.035
Oh, my.

20:06.239 --> 20:07.540
But...

20:07.574 --> 20:09.376
But the leak!
How did you...

20:09.409 --> 20:12.111
Well, I had a wedding
scheduled for the weekend

20:12.144 --> 20:16.048
and today I just had
a feeling to start prepping
Grey House early.

20:16.082 --> 20:17.950
-A feeling?
-A feeling.

20:17.984 --> 20:19.319
And the wedding?

20:19.352 --> 20:21.421
The father of the bride
had to have emergency surgery,

20:21.454 --> 20:23.556
-so they have to postpone.
-Fabulous!

20:23.590 --> 20:26.192
Well, you know, not about
the father or the wedding,

20:26.225 --> 20:27.394
but for us.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.296
The ball will go on!

20:30.597 --> 20:31.998
Oh, Cassie, thank you.

20:35.302 --> 20:37.804
STEPHANIE: Ten minutes before
the guests start arriving.

20:44.344 --> 20:46.613
-Hey, Ryan.
-Hey, Steph.

20:46.646 --> 20:47.714
You're early.

20:48.715 --> 20:50.817
Yeah, well, that I am.

20:50.850 --> 20:52.285
I was hoping
I could talk to you.

20:54.220 --> 20:55.422
What do you want?

20:56.289 --> 20:57.290
(SCOFFS)

20:58.625 --> 21:00.593
Look. (SIGHS)

21:00.627 --> 21:02.795
I know it's a little late...

21:02.829 --> 21:05.164
Okay, it's a lot late,
but, uh,

21:06.899 --> 21:08.067
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

21:12.839 --> 21:14.941
-What do you expect me to say?
-Nothing.

21:16.175 --> 21:17.510
I just...

21:17.544 --> 21:20.179
I wanted to say what
I should have said years ago.

21:21.213 --> 21:22.415
And, uh,

21:22.449 --> 21:25.117
now I've said it,
so thanks for that.

21:27.086 --> 21:30.022
And you... You and Cassie
make a great couple.

21:30.056 --> 21:32.725
It's nice to see you so,
you know, happy.

21:37.196 --> 21:38.998
Right, well, um...

21:44.737 --> 21:45.872
Don't you hate it

21:45.905 --> 21:47.940
when horrible people
do not-so horrible things?

21:58.785 --> 22:00.987
You look so beautiful, Mom.

22:04.223 --> 22:06.659
Aw, but you are
the real beauty.

22:08.928 --> 22:10.630
But

22:10.663 --> 22:12.331
you don't wanna look
beautiful, do you?

22:13.566 --> 22:14.734
-What?
-Well,

22:16.436 --> 22:17.837
if you look beautiful,

22:19.105 --> 22:21.508
then you'll attract people,

22:21.541 --> 22:24.944
then maybe you'll feel
attracted to them.

22:26.813 --> 22:29.949
It's not cheating on Daddy.

22:32.652 --> 22:33.753
I know.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.156
He wants you to be happy.

22:38.725 --> 22:40.092
Yeah, I know,

22:40.126 --> 22:42.061
-but, um...
-Mom,

22:45.498 --> 22:46.699
it's time.

22:49.802 --> 22:50.803
Thanks.

23:08.788 --> 23:09.789
Hi.

23:10.590 --> 23:12.291
Thanks for letting me
come back.

23:12.324 --> 23:13.860
You're welcome here anytime.

23:15.094 --> 23:17.430
So you... You know
the truth about me?

23:18.465 --> 23:20.366
Brandon told me.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.435
I don't know if I can testify,
Cassie.

23:25.672 --> 23:28.541
Tonight, you are safe.

23:30.309 --> 23:31.611
-And, uh...
-(CHUCKLES)

23:31.644 --> 23:35.014
...it could be good for you
to try and have some fun.

23:37.216 --> 23:38.417
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

23:44.123 --> 23:46.158
(INDISTINCT TALKING)

23:56.302 --> 23:58.204
Have you seen Nick?

23:58.237 --> 24:00.139
Uh, he's coming.

24:00.172 --> 24:01.774
-You sure?
-Yeah.

24:03.810 --> 24:05.277
He better be.

24:08.881 --> 24:10.416
This is not a pub!

24:10.883 --> 24:12.218
Shoulders back.

24:12.251 --> 24:14.887
Tray, shoulder height.
Up, up, up! Up!

24:14.921 --> 24:17.824
-Go. Now.
-But I...

24:17.857 --> 24:20.392
-I wasn't finished with him.
-You have to stand down.

24:20.426 --> 24:21.594
Excuse me?

24:21.628 --> 24:24.063
You need to back off the staff
or I'm gonna have a mutiny

24:24.096 --> 24:26.533
-on my hands.
-But they are not carrying
their trays properly.

24:26.566 --> 24:28.668
If you don't leave them alone,
Madam Mayor,

24:28.701 --> 24:30.570
they are going to
improperly carry their trays

24:30.603 --> 24:32.104
to their cars and drive away.

24:32.471 --> 24:33.472
Oh.

24:37.610 --> 24:38.645
Ah.

24:41.380 --> 24:44.250
Looks like you were right
about me finding a place
for that money.

24:44.283 --> 24:46.786
-You found Ashley.
-I did.

24:48.988 --> 24:50.456
And if you hadn't...

24:50.489 --> 24:53.359
Does she know
who you really are?

24:53.392 --> 24:56.963
She has so many problems
and she's scared.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.365
Maybe she just needs
a little lesson in bravery.

25:06.706 --> 25:08.140
Wow!

25:08.174 --> 25:11.811
Ryan is gonna be knocked
on his... Well, you know.

25:11.844 --> 25:14.781
Uh, I didn't dress for Ryan.

25:14.814 --> 25:18.517
-Well, he dressed for you.
-Uh, what do you mean?

25:18.551 --> 25:22.555
It is amazing that you see so
many things for other people,

25:22.589 --> 25:25.257
but yet are totally blind to
the fact that Ryan likes you,

25:25.291 --> 25:26.826
and not just as a friend.

25:32.765 --> 25:34.000
-Wow!
-(CHUCKLES)

25:34.033 --> 25:36.468
You look marvelous.

25:36.502 --> 25:37.604
Thanks.

25:39.005 --> 25:41.941
Um, these are for you.
Thank you.

25:41.974 --> 25:45.077
-Sweet!
-Yeah, sweet.

25:49.481 --> 25:50.917
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

26:01.160 --> 26:02.795
Okay, what gives?

26:04.030 --> 26:06.132
-What?
-Don't "what" me.

26:07.266 --> 26:08.668
What's going on
with you and Nick?

26:08.701 --> 26:12.338
All you need to know is that
Amber was driving me crazy

26:16.843 --> 26:18.310
and now she's with Nick.

26:18.344 --> 26:20.947
Why won't you tell me
what's really going on?

26:20.980 --> 26:23.215
-I can't.
-Since when don't you
tell me things?

26:23.249 --> 26:24.817
I promised.

26:24.851 --> 26:26.653
Well, whatever he told you
must be pretty bad.

26:26.686 --> 26:28.254
Anthony.

26:29.155 --> 26:30.156
Okay, fine.

26:37.029 --> 26:38.898
-Cassie, hi!
-Oh, hello.

26:39.632 --> 26:41.801
Where's your man?

26:41.834 --> 26:43.369
-Ryan.
-He's on a call.

26:43.402 --> 26:45.237
-Business.
-(SCOFFS)

26:47.273 --> 26:49.742
You two got together,
kind of, all of a sudden, huh?

26:49.776 --> 26:51.177
We did.

26:51.210 --> 26:53.846
-I still have a lot
of friends in town.
-Yes.

26:53.880 --> 26:56.148
-My parents still live here.
-Hmm, right.

26:56.182 --> 26:59.551
And no one has said anything
about you and Ryan dating.

26:59.585 --> 27:01.220
-It's funny, huh?
-Yeah, yeah, we've been,

27:01.253 --> 27:03.289
you know,
keeping it kind of quiet.

27:03.322 --> 27:04.323
Yep.

27:05.792 --> 27:06.959
Okay, look,

27:06.993 --> 27:09.962
I know Ryan, we almost
got married, and he's good

27:09.996 --> 27:12.631
at a lot of things,
but lying is not one of them.

27:14.033 --> 27:16.102
You two aren't really dating,
are you?

27:16.135 --> 27:18.604
I know I'm right, I do!

27:18.637 --> 27:20.372
And I know why Ryan would lie,

27:20.406 --> 27:23.676
but what I don't get is why
you would go along with it.

27:23.710 --> 27:25.277
I just have to ask,

27:25.311 --> 27:28.981
why do you care so much
who Ryan does or doesn't date?

27:30.016 --> 27:31.483
I don't care.

27:31.517 --> 27:33.152
No, you do.

27:34.320 --> 27:37.056
And I think you need
to ask yourself why.

27:37.957 --> 27:39.158
I have my own idea,

27:39.191 --> 27:41.593
but I'll let you figure
that one out for yourself.

27:45.865 --> 27:46.899
What's in the punch?

27:46.933 --> 27:48.200
Oh, wouldn't you like to know!

27:48.234 --> 27:50.903
(CHUCKLES)
Yes, one punch, pl...

27:50.937 --> 27:52.705
Make it two, please.

27:54.306 --> 27:56.175
Well, you look stunning.

27:58.644 --> 28:01.513
-You clean up nicely yourself.
-Oh.

28:01.547 --> 28:04.583
Thanks. I didn't think I'd be
wearing this suit so soon,

28:04.616 --> 28:05.818
but, um,

28:05.852 --> 28:08.687
you know, Middleton is more of
a casual place. I like that.

28:08.721 --> 28:10.857
But we still like to put on
our party clothes.

28:10.890 --> 28:12.191
Clearly.

28:12.224 --> 28:13.726
You should do it more often.

28:14.894 --> 28:17.296
Hey, uh, I'm sorry about

28:17.329 --> 28:19.098
earlier. That conversation...

28:19.131 --> 28:20.699
Oh, it's okay to be hurt, Sam.

28:20.733 --> 28:22.234
Yeah. She cheated on me.

28:22.902 --> 28:24.136
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

28:24.170 --> 28:25.938
I don't want to talk
about it, really.

28:25.972 --> 28:28.808
It's just that...
I only want to apologize.

28:28.841 --> 28:32.411
-Hmm, for being right again?
-(BOTH CHUCKLE)

28:32.444 --> 28:35.181
Bottom line is,
people don't change.

28:35.214 --> 28:37.683
But sometimes,
they do surprise you.

28:37.716 --> 28:38.851
(AMBER GIGGLING)

28:40.719 --> 28:42.922
Hey, Nick! You came.

28:43.790 --> 28:45.657
Uh, yeah, I did.

28:48.227 --> 28:49.261
AMBER: Nick...

28:49.295 --> 28:50.797
Uh, see you, Dad.

28:50.830 --> 28:52.431
-Okay.
-(GIGGLES)

28:54.433 --> 28:56.102
-Excuse us.
-Oh!

28:56.135 --> 28:57.804
You're an "us" now?

29:03.175 --> 29:05.477
Did you make a decision about
whether you're gonna testify?

29:06.813 --> 29:07.980
No.

29:08.014 --> 29:09.882
Why did you show up
at the shelter?

29:10.817 --> 29:11.818
And

29:12.985 --> 29:14.987
how do you know my real name?

29:17.456 --> 29:18.757
Who are you?

29:20.659 --> 29:24.730
And why do you care so much
about what happens to me?

29:24.763 --> 29:26.598
I really do want to tell you.

29:26.632 --> 29:28.134
So tell me.

29:28.167 --> 29:30.236
To be honest,

29:30.269 --> 29:34.406
I'm a little scared
at how you'll react
when I tell you the truth.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.208
So,

29:36.242 --> 29:39.245
I'm gonna take a deep breath

29:39.278 --> 29:40.847
and I'll tell you the truth.

29:40.880 --> 29:42.748
-About me?
-About us.

29:43.850 --> 29:44.851
"Us"?

29:47.386 --> 29:48.720
I'm your grandfather.

29:55.094 --> 29:56.328
(SIGHS)

29:58.164 --> 29:59.565
(INAUDIBLE)

30:05.304 --> 30:06.372
Hi.

30:06.405 --> 30:07.940
-Hey.
-Hey, I'm Mark.

30:07.974 --> 30:09.208
-Sam.
-Hmm.

30:11.177 --> 30:13.245
Do you live in Middleton?

30:13.279 --> 30:15.314
Uh, not anymore.
(CHUCKLES)

30:15.347 --> 30:18.117
I'm from New York.
Just moved here.

30:18.150 --> 30:20.086
Eesh! Oh, sorry to hear that.

30:20.119 --> 30:22.188
(CHUCKLES) I like it.

30:22.221 --> 30:23.856
Do you come to the festival
every year?

30:23.890 --> 30:26.158
(LAUGHS)
Not if I can help it.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.261
So what brings you this year?

30:29.295 --> 30:30.362
Well,

30:30.396 --> 30:32.664
I have a little business here.

30:32.698 --> 30:35.101
-Business?
-I'm in real estate.

30:35.134 --> 30:36.168
Hey, so is Ryan.

30:37.336 --> 30:38.804
Yeah, I know.

30:39.939 --> 30:42.108
So, are you here to see Ryan?

30:43.575 --> 30:45.811
I'm here to see
a client of his

30:45.844 --> 30:47.113
that, uh,

30:47.146 --> 30:49.281
might be looking to
become a client of mine.

30:50.549 --> 30:51.884
(CHUCKLES)

31:00.492 --> 31:02.261
Thanks for bringing me
a drink.

31:02.294 --> 31:04.696
Oh, doesn't seem right
you being stuck in here
all night.

31:04.730 --> 31:09.368
Ah, well, I'll get out
eventually. (CHUCKLES)

31:09.401 --> 31:10.802
Are you saving me a dance?

31:11.537 --> 31:12.671
I was considering it.

31:13.605 --> 31:16.108
Well, consider
your dance card filled

31:16.142 --> 31:17.843
as soon as I get out
of this kitchen.

31:21.413 --> 31:24.683
-Hey, can I ask you
a question?
-Mmm-hmm.

31:24.716 --> 31:26.718
What's the deal with Mark?

31:26.752 --> 31:29.421
-Ryan's ex-besty.
-Yeah.

31:29.455 --> 31:30.556
How long do you have?

31:31.890 --> 31:33.492
(CHUCKLING)

31:38.864 --> 31:40.967
What're you so happy about?

31:43.069 --> 31:44.136
I, uh...

31:44.170 --> 31:46.805
I promised Grace
I wouldn't say.

31:46.838 --> 31:47.839
Excuse me.

31:49.841 --> 31:51.343
(INDISTINCT)

32:00.552 --> 32:03.255
Thank you for this.

32:03.289 --> 32:05.591
CASSIE: You don't need me.
RYAN: Oh, I do.

32:05.624 --> 32:07.693
Hmm, you only think you do.

32:07.726 --> 32:09.328
So changing the subject,

32:11.497 --> 32:13.432
Mark apologized.

32:13.465 --> 32:14.800
Really?

32:14.833 --> 32:17.569
Yeah. I think he wants
to be friends or something.

32:18.470 --> 32:19.471
And you?

32:20.973 --> 32:23.575
I never thought
I'd have this dilemma.

32:24.610 --> 32:25.978
I thought hell would
freeze over

32:26.012 --> 32:28.514
before he'd ever own up
to what he did to me.

32:28.547 --> 32:29.581
And?

32:31.950 --> 32:34.553
I don't know, Cassie,
I don't know if I'm ready

32:34.586 --> 32:37.356
to try all this forgiveness
stuff you're talking about.

32:38.424 --> 32:39.591
Well, you'll know when.

32:48.567 --> 32:50.236
I'm gonna testify.

32:51.237 --> 32:53.572
I called Zimmerman.
I wanted you to know.

32:53.605 --> 32:54.906
What made you
change your mind?

32:56.342 --> 32:57.376
My grandfather.

32:59.145 --> 33:01.780
-I have a grandfather.
-Yeah?

33:01.813 --> 33:02.848
Yeah!

33:04.016 --> 33:07.753
I... I ran to Middleton
to get away from my life

33:07.786 --> 33:10.889
and I actually found
a life I didn't know I had.

33:11.723 --> 33:14.893
I found my past and, I guess,

33:14.926 --> 33:17.596
the strength to do
the right thing.

33:17.629 --> 33:20.766
And the only way
any of that is gonna happen

33:20.799 --> 33:23.735
is if I testify
and put my fiance in jail.

33:24.970 --> 33:26.805
So, you're leaving?

33:27.706 --> 33:29.408
But maybe
I'll be back someday.

33:29.908 --> 33:31.009
I'd like that.

33:33.479 --> 33:34.513
Thank you.

33:35.681 --> 33:37.883
-Hey!
-Hi, there.

33:37.916 --> 33:40.119
-I think I need
to tell you something.
-Shoot.

33:40.152 --> 33:43.655
-You know your friend, Mark?
-Mark's not my friend.

33:43.689 --> 33:45.257
That's an accurate statement.

33:47.259 --> 33:50.196
So I'm gonna to go back
and help her while
she testifies.

33:50.229 --> 33:53.199
And we're gonna
take it from there.

33:55.401 --> 33:57.002
Thank you.

33:57.035 --> 33:58.937
Oh, I didn't do anything,
you did.

34:00.772 --> 34:03.409
And I think you kept
your promise to your wife.

34:04.676 --> 34:06.145
Yeah.

34:06.178 --> 34:07.413
I think I did.

34:10.416 --> 34:13.585
-Hey.
-What'd you say to Anthony?

34:13.619 --> 34:14.886
-What?
-Anthony!

34:14.920 --> 34:17.589
-You told him, didn't you?
-No.

34:17.623 --> 34:19.858
-No, I didn't.
-You're lying.

34:19.891 --> 34:22.294
-(EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST)
-I... Nick!

34:30.502 --> 34:33.239
Man, you and Annie
deserve one another.

34:33.272 --> 34:34.806
-Excuse me?
-No, I don't think I will,

34:34.840 --> 34:36.108
not this time!

34:36.142 --> 34:38.510
Neither of you is actually
here for the dance, right?

34:39.878 --> 34:42.714
All right.
What are we here for?

34:42.748 --> 34:45.351
Well, Annie's here to make
sure that I'm still alone

34:45.384 --> 34:47.486
and you are here to steal
some of my business.

34:47.519 --> 34:48.854
I don't know what
you're talking about.

34:48.887 --> 34:50.622
You've been lying so long.

34:50.656 --> 34:52.258
I don't think you'd know
how to tell the truth

34:52.291 --> 34:54.793
-if your life depended on it.
-(CHUCKLES)

34:54.826 --> 34:56.528
-(RYAN CHUCKLES SARCASTICALLY)
-Well, you know what,

34:56.562 --> 34:58.264
I guess we're never
going to be friends again.

34:58.297 --> 35:00.599
We were never friends
in the first place!
That was my mistake.

35:00.632 --> 35:02.401
Yours was coming back here,

35:02.434 --> 35:03.769
thinking you could
screw me over again.

35:03.802 --> 35:05.637
-Now wait a minute...
-I'm done with you

35:05.671 --> 35:07.306
and I'm done with Annie.

35:07.339 --> 35:08.507
Fine.

35:08.540 --> 35:10.942
And Jones, the real estate
developer you thought

35:10.976 --> 35:13.812
that you could steal from me,
he's done with you, too.

35:13.845 --> 35:15.581
Yeah.

35:15.614 --> 35:18.684
See, 'cause I got
a little tip from Sam,

35:18.717 --> 35:19.918
so I called him.

35:19.951 --> 35:21.487
Jones knew you were full of it

35:21.520 --> 35:24.256
from the first time
that he spoke to you.

35:25.191 --> 35:27.893
You're losing your game,
buddy. (CHUCKLES)

35:28.894 --> 35:30.896
(CHUCKLES)

35:30.929 --> 35:33.932
(SIGHS) You're never
gonna get over the fact

35:33.965 --> 35:35.601
that I stole Annie from you.

35:36.802 --> 35:38.270
You're wrong.

35:39.405 --> 35:40.872
I am over it.

35:41.807 --> 35:42.808
Right.

35:44.243 --> 35:46.778
Finally and for good,

35:46.812 --> 35:48.847
I am over it.

35:48.880 --> 35:51.817
Which is why
I can tell you this,

35:51.850 --> 35:53.118
I forgive you.

35:53.919 --> 35:55.120
I don't understand.

35:55.854 --> 35:57.055
(SCOFFS)

35:57.088 --> 35:59.491
It's not about you,
it's about me.

36:02.794 --> 36:04.430
Just go.

36:04.463 --> 36:07.032
(CHUCKLES) Go?
Why would I go?

36:10.035 --> 36:12.571
Because you've been caught

36:12.604 --> 36:14.440
and you can't lie
your way out of this one.

36:22.548 --> 36:25.817
And because Middleton
is my town, it's my home.

36:27.152 --> 36:29.154
And I think you're not
welcome here anymore.

36:36.962 --> 36:39.731
(SIGHS) I should have known
I'd never get out
of this kitchen.

36:39.765 --> 36:42.100
-(CHUCKLES)
-You don't need to.

36:42.133 --> 36:44.035
To what?

36:44.069 --> 36:45.237
Get out of the kitchen.

36:51.009 --> 36:52.511
Impressive.

36:52.544 --> 36:54.846
-Oh, I've got moves.
-(CHUCKLES)

36:55.847 --> 36:56.948
Hey!

36:56.982 --> 36:58.450
I just want to make
something clear.

36:58.484 --> 37:01.887
-Okay.
-I don't care about Ryan.

37:01.920 --> 37:05.056
-I think you do.
-RYAN: Oh, hey, ladies.

37:05.090 --> 37:06.292
What's going on?

37:06.325 --> 37:09.127
-Just give it up, Ryan.
-Give what up?

37:09.160 --> 37:10.829
You and Cassie
are not together.

37:10.862 --> 37:12.898
I know you're lying.
Just admit it.

37:12.931 --> 37:15.166
-(SIGHS)
-Just let it go.

37:15.200 --> 37:18.737
No! I know I'm right.
Just admit it.

37:18.770 --> 37:21.172
No, Annie, you're wrong!

37:43.962 --> 37:45.931
Together enough for you?

37:51.069 --> 37:52.170
What happened?

37:53.138 --> 37:55.674
He thinks I did something.

37:55.707 --> 37:57.709
What does he think I did?

37:59.411 --> 38:00.412
Anthony?

38:02.113 --> 38:03.415
I may have let him believe

38:03.449 --> 38:05.317
that you told me
what you wouldn't tell me.

38:07.753 --> 38:09.087
Hi, Anthony.

38:12.057 --> 38:13.425
You okay?

38:13.459 --> 38:14.993
Yeah.

38:15.026 --> 38:16.227
I have to go.

38:16.261 --> 38:18.630
-Okay, I'll see you later.
-Okay.

38:22.701 --> 38:24.836
-Everything okay?
-Yeah.

38:28.273 --> 38:32.478
Thanks for that, um,
the kiss.

38:32.511 --> 38:35.080
-It shut her up. (CHUCKLES)
-That it did.

38:35.113 --> 38:36.147
Yes.

38:37.383 --> 38:39.618
I think I get the whole
forgiveness thing now.

38:39.651 --> 38:41.319
It's pretty powerful
stuff, huh?

38:41.353 --> 38:42.654
Yeah, I feel like a new man.

38:43.722 --> 38:45.557
I guess, I was just

38:45.591 --> 38:48.394
blinded by what I thought was
love and I spent a lot of time

38:48.427 --> 38:50.596
telling everyone
who cared for me

38:50.629 --> 38:53.164
that they didn't understand,
that they didn't get Annie.

38:54.099 --> 38:55.133
But

38:56.502 --> 38:58.637
I didn't get it, not them.

38:59.905 --> 39:01.172
And then I got it.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.742
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

39:03.775 --> 39:05.711
So again, thank you.

39:06.545 --> 39:07.713
For?

39:07.746 --> 39:08.880
For coming with me,

39:08.914 --> 39:11.550
for kissing me in front
of the whole town.

39:11.583 --> 39:13.018
You are a good friend.

39:29.568 --> 39:30.569
Look,

39:31.803 --> 39:33.138
I just wanted you to know

39:33.171 --> 39:35.574
that I didn't tell Anthony
anything.

39:35.607 --> 39:37.008
I don't believe you.

39:45.517 --> 39:47.352
(SIGHS) Hey.

39:49.287 --> 39:51.590
It seems I won a race,
but lost an argument.

39:51.623 --> 39:53.024
Yeah?

39:53.058 --> 39:56.227
People can change,
especially my son.

39:56.261 --> 39:57.729
Just have to give them
a chance.

39:58.764 --> 40:01.366
-Wow.
-What?

40:01.399 --> 40:03.969
So this is what it feels like
to be wrong.

40:04.903 --> 40:07.138
Hmm, you better
get used to it.

40:08.607 --> 40:10.308
Well, living next door to you,

40:10.341 --> 40:11.677
I think I better.

40:17.883 --> 40:20.719
Well, that was a Heritage Ball
to remember.

40:20.752 --> 40:24.022
I can honestly say that
I can't wait for next year.

40:25.824 --> 40:27.158
One more for the road?

40:36.201 --> 40:37.936
You know something?

40:39.004 --> 40:41.172
I think we make
an amazing fake couple.

40:41.206 --> 40:43.709
-I agree.
-(BOTH CHUCKLE)

40:50.682 --> 40:51.817
Maybe...

40:53.585 --> 40:55.420
Maybe we should
try it for real.

41:08.834 --> 41:11.336
They make a nice couple,
don't they?

41:23.582 --> 41:25.083
