00:00.643 --> 00:03.209
Don't try anything
you're about to see at home.

00:03.404 --> 00:05.532
That's right.
We're what you call experts.

00:11.634 --> 00:13.665
On this episode
of "mythbusters"...

00:43.317 --> 00:45.982
Jamie,
I've got a present for you.

00:58.916 --> 01:01.318
Welcome to hollywood explosions
on trial.

01:04.785 --> 01:06.562
Who are the mythbusters?

01:08.000 --> 01:10.668
Adam savage...
I got the chicken!

01:11.099 --> 01:14.436
...And Jamie Hyneman.
What could go wrong?

01:15.052 --> 01:18.910
Between them, more than 30 years
of special-effects experience.

01:19.030 --> 01:23.748
Together with Tory Belleci...
Let's chop this car up!

01:23.868 --> 01:25.483
...Grant imahara...
Something just touched me!

01:25.485 --> 01:27.652
...And Kari Byron...

01:28.823 --> 01:33.676
They don't just tell the myths.
They put them to the test.

01:35.553 --> 01:40.028
<i>Corrected by Bedu
feliratok.info</i>

01:47.363 --> 01:50.849
- Looks dangerous.
- It is very dangerous.

01:51.724 --> 01:53.974
This is possibly
the most dangerous story

01:54.094 --> 01:55.446
We have ever filmed.

01:56.969 --> 01:57.916
Fire!

01:59.745 --> 02:00.508
It didn't go off.

02:00.628 --> 02:03.786
We have a live grenade.
We cannot leave this bunker

02:03.906 --> 02:08.250
- Until we deal with this situation.
- Let me guess. It involves a grenade.

02:08.782 --> 02:10.728
You're like a mind reader.
Yes, it totally does!

02:10.729 --> 02:16.921
Pop quiz, hotshot. What would you
do if someone threw one of these at you?

02:17.041 --> 02:20.746
- Why, you kiss your ass goodbye.
- That is one solution.

02:20.866 --> 02:22.918
Another solution favored by
hollywood movie action heroes...

02:23.560 --> 02:25.323
Pull out a gun
and shoot it out of the air.

02:25.578 --> 02:27.581
And that is where
I think we need to begin.

02:27.781 --> 02:28.715
Okay.

02:30.479 --> 02:32.535
It's a standard
action-movie move.

02:33.137 --> 02:35.900
To protect yourself
from an incoming grenade,

02:36.020 --> 02:40.376
You take it out midair, where one
of three things can happen...

02:40.496 --> 02:44.307
It explodes safely...
It's rendered inert...

02:44.427 --> 02:47.098
Or it's sent back
from whence it came.

02:50.114 --> 02:53.004
Now, when it comes to
shooting objects out of midair,

02:53.124 --> 02:55.740
That's a sport, actually, called
trap shooting or skeet shooting.

02:55.742 --> 02:58.943
- I think it's this way.
- Pull.

03:01.057 --> 03:02.480
And when you want to do that
in the bay area...

03:02.482 --> 03:03.281
Pull!

03:03.283 --> 03:07.752
...You come here, to the
coyote valley sporting clay.

03:07.754 --> 03:09.420
You must be Dave.

03:10.411 --> 03:12.123
Our teacher today is Dave Braidu.

03:12.125 --> 03:12.624
Pull.

03:12.626 --> 03:16.261
He's been an instructor for 16 years,
and he's gonna teach Jamie and I

03:16.263 --> 03:20.172
How to rid the world
of the scourge of clay pigeons.

03:21.787 --> 03:24.280
It would be an understatement
to say we've fired a lot of guns

03:24.400 --> 03:26.371
- In the course of doing this show.
- You will come across...

03:26.373 --> 03:29.574
Over the years,
we've fired pistols...

03:29.576 --> 03:32.510
Rifles... Cannons.

03:33.647 --> 03:37.582
We've fired <i> from</i> moving cars,
<i>at</i> moving cars.

03:37.584 --> 03:39.651
I'm feeling pretty shot up.

03:39.653 --> 03:42.818
We've even fired bullets
at other bullets.

03:42.938 --> 03:46.291
But this time, we're trying to hit
a moving target in midair...

03:46.293 --> 03:47.096
Pull.

03:49.194 --> 03:51.930
You were close,
but not close enough.

03:51.932 --> 03:56.186
...Training on clay pigeons so that
hopefully we can hit a grenade.

03:59.782 --> 04:00.314
Pull.

04:02.412 --> 04:06.756
If they can't even hit a moving target,
Then the myth falls at the first hurdle.

04:08.836 --> 04:09.452
Pull.

04:11.475 --> 04:15.253
And at first, it's not as easy
As hollywood would have us believe.

04:17.067 --> 04:19.027
Yeah, I was a little,
uh, behind it.

04:19.147 --> 04:20.925
But they've got a great teacher.

04:20.927 --> 04:24.295
- Pull.
- Nice shot.

04:25.365 --> 04:28.299
Fantastic. Very nice shot.

04:28.767 --> 04:29.292
Pull.

04:31.090 --> 04:31.802
There we go.

04:31.922 --> 04:33.351
Hey!
Beautiful shot.

04:38.028 --> 04:38.557
Ooh.

04:38.677 --> 04:40.060
I was just gonna tell you
about that.

04:41.057 --> 04:42.313
We've been shooting
at these clays from the side,

04:42.315 --> 04:45.278
But if you're trying to avoid
getting hit by a grenade,

04:45.644 --> 04:48.088
You're gonna be more concerned
when they're coming right at ya.

04:49.786 --> 04:51.034
Yeah, got it!

04:52.993 --> 04:53.832
Like that.

04:57.343 --> 04:57.992
Pull.

05:00.705 --> 05:02.616
Very well-done,
nice shot.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.682
Interestingly, the more realistic

05:04.802 --> 05:07.362
Oncoming trajectory
is a lot easier to hit.

05:07.482 --> 05:10.923
So far, this myth is moving
in the right direction.

05:12.355 --> 05:13.204
Sweet.

05:13.548 --> 05:14.247
Pull.

05:16.815 --> 05:17.897
Yeah.

05:25.481 --> 05:26.809
- So, Adam.
- Yes, sir?

05:26.929 --> 05:29.763
To celebrate
our newly found skills,

05:29.883 --> 05:32.830
I'm gonna go over
behind that building over there

05:32.832 --> 05:38.169
- And toss my beret out.
- No way! And let me shoot at it?

05:38.171 --> 05:40.442
- You've got one shot.
- I'll take it.

05:49.777 --> 05:50.409
Pull.

05:56.650 --> 05:59.590
- I can't tell if I hit... did I hit it?
- I think you did.

05:59.592 --> 06:00.235
Oh!

06:00.355 --> 06:03.061
Sorry.
Let's go take a look.

06:03.063 --> 06:03.728
All right.

06:03.730 --> 06:07.202
I think you did.
There's the proof.

06:10.918 --> 06:12.070
Dude, I get to keep this

06:12.072 --> 06:14.772
And stuff and mount it
in my trophy case.

06:14.774 --> 06:17.742
- Well, what am I gonna wear?
- Oh, we'll get you another beret.

06:17.744 --> 06:20.531
Okay, you let me know
when it arrives.

06:20.651 --> 06:21.200
Okay.

06:31.581 --> 06:33.059
"Seconds from disaster?"

06:33.179 --> 06:35.206
I'm not sure
I like the sound of this one.

06:35.326 --> 06:36.327
No, this is gonna be a good one.

06:36.329 --> 06:39.163
This is that old, clichÃ©,
hollywood device

06:39.165 --> 06:41.551
Where the hero finds himself

06:41.671 --> 06:43.935
In the possession of a bomb
that's about to go off.

06:43.937 --> 06:44.867
Candygram!

06:46.338 --> 06:47.272
Ah!

06:49.310 --> 06:52.020
Instead of letting it explode,
he surveys his surroundings

06:52.140 --> 06:54.445
And then finds a place
to stash it.

06:54.447 --> 06:56.681
The question is,
is this gonna work in real life?

06:56.683 --> 06:58.673
- Can you stash it, dive, survive?
- Well, it sounds like

06:58.793 --> 07:00.814
We're gonna have to
set off some explosions.

07:00.934 --> 07:02.145
You know how much we hate that.

07:10.388 --> 07:12.365
So, we're here at the
Alameda County Bomb Range

07:12.485 --> 07:15.144
To see what items that you
would find in your household

07:15.264 --> 07:17.052
That could protect you
from an explosion.

07:17.172 --> 07:20.051
Now, the amount we're gonna be
using is a pound of c-4.

07:20.171 --> 07:22.578
When in doubt, C-4.

07:25.524 --> 07:26.569
So, what is C-4?

07:26.689 --> 07:30.506
Well, its technical designation
Is cyclotrimethylene-trinitramine.

07:30.626 --> 07:32.578
When you want
a high-velocity explosive

07:32.698 --> 07:35.448
That's also very stable,
C-4 can't be beat.

07:35.568 --> 07:38.276
You could set it on fire
and it wouldn't go off.

07:38.396 --> 07:40.445
You could hit with a hammer
and it wouldn't detonate.

07:40.565 --> 07:42.627
What it does take
to detonate C-4

07:42.629 --> 07:45.113
Is detcord or a blasting cap.

07:46.394 --> 07:50.638
The explosion of the blasting cap
applies a really powerful shock

07:50.758 --> 07:53.081
That triggers the C-4
explosive material.

07:53.201 --> 07:57.137
As the C-4 decomposes,
it releases a variety of gases

07:57.257 --> 08:00.533
That expand at over
26,000 feet per second.

08:01.468 --> 08:05.376
Now, before we can find out if
you can contain that explosion,

08:05.496 --> 08:08.022
We need to find out what its
power is <i> without</i> containment,

08:08.142 --> 08:09.554
And for that,
we're gonna do a control.

08:10.456 --> 08:12.327
All right, Buster,
the bomb's about to go off.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.192
Jump!

08:14.873 --> 08:16.767
So, how are we measuring
the shock wave?

08:16.887 --> 08:17.669
Safe!

08:17.789 --> 08:22.160
With these, burst discs
made by a company called Oseco.

08:22.280 --> 08:24.852
Now, what happens
when an explosive goes off

08:24.972 --> 08:28.184
Is that you have a shock wave
that propagates spherically out

08:28.304 --> 08:29.629
From the center of the explosion.

08:30.338 --> 08:32.381
All right, so, that's 20 feet
away from the blast zone.

08:32.501 --> 08:35.980
These are calibrated
to burst at a specific psi.

08:35.982 --> 08:40.150
This one is 13 psi, which we're
using to measure injury.

08:40.270 --> 08:43.263
Because, remember, it's not
whether the hero lives or dies,

08:43.383 --> 08:45.957
It's whether
he walks away unscathed.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.158
Ready.

08:47.160 --> 08:50.316
In three, two, one.

08:53.811 --> 08:56.840
- Whoa. - That was a good one.
- I felt that one.

09:01.631 --> 09:04.141
- Look at that.
- That's perfect.

09:04.143 --> 09:07.342
So, we've successfully
identified the injury zone.

09:07.462 --> 09:09.872
For our experiment,
this is at 12 feet.

09:10.283 --> 09:14.615
At 14 feet, the disc didn't go off,
so he'd be safe out there.

09:14.735 --> 09:18.522
We're gonna set our guy
right here at the 12-foot marker

09:18.524 --> 09:23.127
And try it again with our first
household item, A filing cabinet.

09:29.510 --> 09:31.623
Coming up on "mythbusters"...

09:44.826 --> 09:46.224
- Bad baby!
- Run!

09:56.371 --> 09:56.953
Pull!

09:58.334 --> 10:01.132
So, we're done with skeet shooting,
and we didn't do too bad.

10:03.235 --> 10:05.489
- Yeah.
- But that was skeet.

10:07.372 --> 10:08.039
Oh!

10:08.041 --> 10:11.939
Now we're gonna try our hand at hitting
something that's more like a grenade

10:12.059 --> 10:14.393
And see
if they're any harder to hit.

10:14.705 --> 10:15.454
Sweet.

10:17.368 --> 10:21.852
To do that, it's back to the shop,
Where an old favorite is resurrected...

10:23.217 --> 10:24.931
I call it my "little pop-gun."

10:28.776 --> 10:32.093
...And rejigged
to launch paintball grenades...

10:33.461 --> 10:34.882
That looks badass.

10:35.002 --> 10:37.565
...The same distance
as if they were thrown.

10:39.189 --> 10:43.074
- Gun is hot.
- Three, two, one.

10:47.361 --> 10:49.155
That was an awesome sound.

10:49.275 --> 10:53.424
With a little more air pressure
and some room to play with,

10:53.544 --> 10:57.472
They'll soon be lobbing their fake
grenades realistic distances.

10:59.902 --> 11:01.325
That's my little pop-gun.

11:01.327 --> 11:04.895
- And back on location...
- This looks like a good spot.

11:04.897 --> 11:05.743
All right.

11:05.863 --> 11:09.073
...The pop-gun is lined up
and ready to launch.

11:10.288 --> 11:11.598
Just like with skeet shooting,

11:11.718 --> 11:14.105
We're using a 12-gauge shotgun
and bird shot.

11:14.107 --> 11:16.895
- All right, sir. Loading.
- Why bird shot?

11:17.015 --> 11:18.342
Well, because it doesn't
travel very far,

11:18.344 --> 11:20.073
And so it doesn't pose a hazard

11:20.193 --> 11:22.580
For anybody
outside the immediate area.

11:22.582 --> 11:25.583
- This is it.
- Gun is hot.

11:25.585 --> 11:29.092
It's all very well
hitting a harmless clay pigeon

11:29.212 --> 11:31.805
That's designed to float,
but how about

11:31.925 --> 11:35.259
A less-than-aerodynamic
paintball grenade?

11:37.262 --> 11:37.811
Pull!

11:41.606 --> 11:42.433
Nice!

11:44.982 --> 11:48.411
That was the most
satisfying trapshooting ever.

11:51.456 --> 11:54.245
Well, our skeet-shooting
training paid off in spades.

11:55.520 --> 11:56.003
Pull.

12:03.403 --> 12:05.856
I was able to knock four
out of five paintball grenades

12:05.858 --> 12:10.161
Right out of the sky, as evidenced
by their carnage here on my board,

12:10.281 --> 12:12.979
But a paintball grenade
doesn't kill ya...

12:13.099 --> 12:13.789
Pull.

12:14.066 --> 12:15.132
...And I have no idea what,

12:15.134 --> 12:20.134
If anything, bird shot would do
to a real steel grenade.

12:24.042 --> 12:25.142
Yeah!

12:25.144 --> 12:28.491
Nonetheless, I still feel
pretty satisfied with myself.

12:31.087 --> 12:34.196
So, the thing is that bird shot
spreads out in this large pattern

12:34.316 --> 12:36.346
That makes the odds
relatively high

12:36.466 --> 12:39.966
You're gonna hit your target,
and on top of that, I'm betting

12:40.086 --> 12:42.998
That that bird shot's just gonna
bounce off a steel grenade.

12:43.118 --> 12:46.760
It's not gonna do anything to it.
So, what we really want to know

12:46.880 --> 12:50.122
Is what the odds are of actually
hitting an incoming grenade

12:50.242 --> 12:53.169
With a single bullet, and then,
of course, what's the likelihood

12:53.472 --> 12:55.788
Of you being able
to disable it, as well.

12:56.784 --> 12:58.399
All right, sir. I'm ready.

13:04.840 --> 13:08.118
12 feet away from one
pound of exploding C-4

13:08.120 --> 13:10.476
Will result in serious injury,

13:11.425 --> 13:15.426
But Hollywood would have us believe you
could walk away unscathed...

13:15.428 --> 13:17.220
You got this from Jamie's office?

13:17.340 --> 13:21.022
...By dropping the ticking
time bomb in a handily located,

13:21.142 --> 13:23.519
Supposedly boom-proof container...

13:24.555 --> 13:26.465
I'm trying to find my
contract right now.

13:26.585 --> 13:28.205
...Like a filing cabinet.

13:28.901 --> 13:29.500
Okay.

13:29.520 --> 13:34.544
So, this is our same 13-psi,
injury-indicating burst disc.

13:34.628 --> 13:40.213
I don't remember agreeing
to washing Jamie's mustache.

13:40.333 --> 13:43.053
And remember,
with no containment devices,

13:43.055 --> 13:44.362
One pound of C-4

13:44.482 --> 13:47.761
Caused this disc to go off
at this 12-foot range.

13:49.591 --> 13:50.403
Well, I'll be damned.

13:50.523 --> 13:53.030
I guess I have to
wash his mustache.

13:54.110 --> 13:57.835
The goal here is to see
if the containment devices

13:57.837 --> 14:00.431
Serve as some kind
of protection.

14:00.551 --> 14:04.681
And to indicate that,
if this disc does not go off,

14:04.801 --> 14:07.778
Then that means, you know what,
there's no injury at this range

14:07.780 --> 14:10.525
- And they did their job.
- You're probably asking yourself,

14:10.645 --> 14:13.371
"why do you guys have these
styrofoam, cut-out blue guys?"

14:13.491 --> 14:15.382
Well, those are our shrapnel catchers,

14:15.502 --> 14:20.080
Because if the shock wave doesn't
injure you, the shrapnel might.

14:20.705 --> 14:23.335
In three, two, one!

14:26.497 --> 14:28.065
Well, there goes your files.

14:28.067 --> 14:30.100
- Oh, God.
- Wow!

14:30.102 --> 14:31.782
That is a mess of paper.

14:35.798 --> 14:37.326
It's just confetti! Pssh!

14:37.446 --> 14:39.093
All right.
Let's see if it helped.

14:42.376 --> 14:44.420
Well, as far
as the pressure wave goes,

14:44.540 --> 14:47.183
The filing cabinet
did offer some protection.

14:47.303 --> 14:51.978
The disc at 12 feet, the dive-to-survive
zone, did not burst.

14:53.276 --> 14:55.526
Okay, so, the cabinet did
save you from the shock wave,

14:55.528 --> 14:57.682
But you're gonna be killed
by the shrapnel.

14:57.802 --> 14:59.866
I mean, look at that guy's head.
It's been ripped off.

14:59.986 --> 15:03.165
Oh, putting the bomb
in the filing cabinet...

15:05.003 --> 15:07.137
What was I thinking?

15:18.477 --> 15:21.151
Will you take this?
Now we're gonna move on to a bed.

15:21.153 --> 15:25.389
Oh, I kind of want some red,
silky sheets now. This is nice!

15:25.391 --> 15:27.124
Oh, these are fancy!

15:27.126 --> 15:30.085
Now, you might be
asking yourself, "how would you

15:30.205 --> 15:33.197
Use a bed to protect yourself
from an explosion?"

15:33.199 --> 15:37.141
Cue the dream sequence.
Wait for this. It's a little disturbing.

15:45.022 --> 15:45.904
Ah!

15:52.717 --> 15:54.284
That <i> could</i> work.

15:54.286 --> 15:58.271
Here we go.
In three, two, one!

16:00.334 --> 16:01.266
Oh, ho!

16:04.897 --> 16:05.959
That was
really interesting.

16:06.079 --> 16:07.107
All the energy
went up,

16:07.227 --> 16:10.477
And I didn't see any shrapnel
go out towards the guys.

16:13.271 --> 16:17.390
I will be so shocked if stuffing a bomb
under your bed actually saves you.

16:18.250 --> 16:21.495
- You've got to be kidding me.
- I think we might've found something

16:21.615 --> 16:22.907
That's actually bombproof.

16:23.626 --> 16:24.624
Yeah,
I mean, look.

16:24.744 --> 16:26.089
The burst discs
aren't even burst.

16:27.271 --> 16:30.313
And the shrapnel catchers?
Well, they caught nothing

16:30.433 --> 16:32.756
But a gentle rain
of mattress stuffing.

16:32.758 --> 16:33.490
I'm absolutely astounded

16:33.492 --> 16:37.542
At how well the mattress worked
at both absorbing the shock wave

16:37.662 --> 16:40.693
And preventing deadly shrapnel
from hitting our guys.

16:40.813 --> 16:43.971
And if you look at the high-speed,
You'll see exactly why.

16:44.091 --> 16:46.503
All the energy
went straight up into the air.

16:56.158 --> 16:59.270
But up next
is a fish tank full of water,

16:59.390 --> 17:01.386
And that
is a totally different animal.

17:09.040 --> 17:12.663
Welcome back. It's guns versus
grenades... On "mythbusters."

17:14.633 --> 17:18.435
And, truth be told, if someone has
just thrown one of these at you

17:18.436 --> 17:22.106
And you have enough time to see it
and pull a gun to try and shoot at it...

17:22.108 --> 17:22.606
Pull.

17:22.608 --> 17:24.742
...The kind of gun you're
gonna have ready access to

17:24.743 --> 17:26.343
Is gonna be something like this.

17:26.345 --> 17:32.207
But unlike a shotgun, This only fires
a single round, a single piece of lead.

17:32.327 --> 17:35.464
Can you even hit this
in midair with this?

17:35.584 --> 17:37.487
Well, that's what Jamie and I
are about to try and find out.

17:37.607 --> 17:41.315
This time, they're
using a real but inert grenade,

17:41.435 --> 17:45.043
- But there's a hitch with the gun.
- Shooter stands here.

17:45.163 --> 17:48.098
Firing a real one
can't be done safely.

17:48.100 --> 17:52.271
Hand-grenade lobber goes here.

17:52.391 --> 17:55.883
We've chosen this spot because
it's miles away from habitation,

17:56.003 --> 17:58.644
But, even so,
we're loathe to shoot anything

17:58.764 --> 18:02.727
Straight up in the air other than
bird shot. And with that in mind,

18:02.847 --> 18:05.509
We've chosen paintball pistols
to do our test.

18:07.385 --> 18:09.199
Because if we can hit 'em
with those,

18:09.319 --> 18:11.267
We should be able to hit 'em
with a real pistol.

18:12.624 --> 18:18.195
- All right, sir. I'm ready.
<i>- Equally...</i> - Okay, here we go.

18:18.197 --> 18:20.400
Throwing the grenade
in three...

18:20.520 --> 18:22.609
...If they miss
with the paintball pistol,

18:22.729 --> 18:24.706
They're likely to miss
with a real one.

18:29.698 --> 18:32.157
Totally missed it.
Let's try again.

18:33.043 --> 18:35.022
The myth is hitting its first hurdle...

18:38.184 --> 18:41.080
...Because Adam's certainly
not hitting any grenades.

18:50.583 --> 18:53.163
I ran out of ammo.
I got close, though.

18:54.371 --> 18:57.467
They've proven the wide spray
of shotgun shot works.

18:59.396 --> 19:01.659
But the silver-screen scene in question

19:01.679 --> 19:05.656
Usually involves a weapon firing
a single bullet at a time.

19:08.099 --> 19:12.193
And that's...
Proving very, very difficult...

19:12.769 --> 19:13.625
Oh!

19:15.073 --> 19:15.801
I got it!

19:15.921 --> 19:17.451
...But not impossible.

19:19.831 --> 19:23.560
There is paintball paint
on that puppy.

19:23.562 --> 19:27.831
- It can be done.
- It can be done. It <i> can</i> be done.

19:27.833 --> 19:30.467
I was really starting
to lose hope there.

19:30.469 --> 19:33.867
I would've killed you 20 times,
but eventually, you would've got it.

19:34.839 --> 19:35.665
I'm ready.

19:38.777 --> 19:40.787
Look, if someone's
throwing a grenade at me,

19:40.907 --> 19:43.999
I'm gonna use anything at my
disposal to try and save my life.

19:45.234 --> 19:49.511
If that means fruitlessly
shooting a whole clip of rounds

19:49.631 --> 19:52.066
At that thing with a 1%
chance of hitting it...

19:55.360 --> 19:56.020
I got it.

19:57.085 --> 19:58.929
...I'm gonna take those odds.

19:58.931 --> 19:59.897
Nice.

19:59.899 --> 20:02.399
Right in the middle.
Beautiful.

20:05.430 --> 20:07.823
But the real question is,
what happens to a grenade

20:07.943 --> 20:09.421
When you hit it
with a real bullet?

20:10.290 --> 20:12.247
That's the question
we're gonna answer next.

20:19.204 --> 20:21.156
We're testing
different household items

20:21.276 --> 20:24.361
That can mythically contain
the blast of a bomb.

20:25.560 --> 20:29.857
You've got to be kidding me.
This test, we're using a pound of C-4,

20:29.977 --> 20:32.329
And we're throwing it
inside of a fish tank.

20:32.331 --> 20:33.325
Candygram.

20:37.843 --> 20:42.873
To measure it all, we have our Oseco
burst discs and our shrapnel catchers.

20:42.875 --> 20:48.546
This will tell us if a fish tank is
enough to take on one pound of C-4.

20:49.981 --> 20:51.313
So, what do I think's
gonna happen here?

20:51.912 --> 20:56.946
Well, I see an incompressible fluid
Surrounded by a 3/8-inch acrylic tank.

20:57.066 --> 21:00.724
The water is not gonna
really absorb the explosion.

21:00.726 --> 21:02.598
Rather, it's gonna transmit that

21:02.718 --> 21:05.761
Out to the edges of the tank,
which is gonna shatter

21:05.881 --> 21:08.483
Into a million
razor-sharp acrylic pieces.

21:10.356 --> 21:13.182
Personally, I just
don't see this saving anyone.

21:13.302 --> 21:16.490
I think it's going to really
send some shrapnel everywhere.

21:18.526 --> 21:20.790
In three, two, one!

21:23.471 --> 21:24.948
Oh!

21:24.950 --> 21:27.484
Oh, my God. That was awesome!

21:33.740 --> 21:35.955
That did not look good
for our diving,

21:36.075 --> 21:39.283
Would-be survivor,
but what's the evidence say?

21:39.403 --> 21:40.279
Wow.

21:40.399 --> 21:43.528
- That was spectacular.
- Dude, look at this mess.

21:44.942 --> 21:47.803
The damage is not nearly
what I thought it was gonna be.

21:47.923 --> 21:50.682
And the Oseco disc survived,
which means our hero

21:50.802 --> 21:51.950
Would've survived
the shock wave.

21:54.780 --> 21:57.533
Yeah, and look at the guys.
I mean, there's no shrapnel in them.

21:57.653 --> 21:59.065
They look relatively unharmed.

22:02.524 --> 22:05.088
I think all of us are
pretty surprised by this result.

22:05.090 --> 22:07.680
We thought this was gonna shred,

22:07.800 --> 22:09.727
And so there'd just be frag
and shrapnel in all our guys,

22:09.847 --> 22:13.196
But that's not what happened.
And it looked like all of the energy

22:13.198 --> 22:16.733
was focused on the front and the
back of the tank, which was elevated.

22:16.735 --> 22:21.166
So if you hit the deck, you might
walk away from this unscathed.

22:22.553 --> 22:25.016
I think we can actually
call this plausible.

22:25.036 --> 22:26.864
Agreed. I think it's plausible, as well.

22:26.947 --> 22:29.110
- Shocking.
- That was awesome.

22:37.980 --> 22:40.123
Welcome to Angels Camp Quarry,

22:40.243 --> 22:43.907
Because next up,
the team is ramping it up.

22:45.750 --> 22:47.097
Now, what's the scenario?

22:47.631 --> 22:48.712
That's right.

22:49.661 --> 22:50.913
It's a garbage truck.

22:52.861 --> 22:55.354
Imagine this.
It's early in the morning.

22:55.474 --> 22:58.237
You go to your mailbox,
and you find... what is it?

22:58.357 --> 23:02.446
A bomb! What am I gonna do with it?
Oh, I know. It's trash day.

23:02.448 --> 23:05.182
Throw it in the garbage truck.
Now he has two options.

23:05.184 --> 23:09.904
He can jump away from the truck, dive
here, or he could jump off to the side

23:10.024 --> 23:11.735
And let this steel wall
protect him.

23:11.855 --> 23:12.989
Because of that, we're gonna
have two different setups.

23:12.991 --> 23:16.593
We're gonna have a shrapnel
catcher with a burst disc here

23:16.713 --> 23:18.906
And another shrapnel catcher
with a burst disc here

23:19.026 --> 23:21.337
And see whether or not this
garbage truck will protect him.

23:24.716 --> 23:28.572
All right, here we go with one pound of
C-4 in the trough of a garbage truck.

23:29.481 --> 23:34.058
In three, two, one! Fire!

23:37.237 --> 23:38.148
Oh!

23:39.450 --> 23:42.365
Yeah, that was a pretty big pop.

23:49.921 --> 23:52.494
Well, I think it's obvious you don't
want to stand behind the truck.

23:52.614 --> 23:55.394
This guy's blown to bits,
and the Oseco disc is blown.

23:55.514 --> 23:58.201
All right, well,
over here on the side,

23:58.203 --> 24:00.666
Looks like you'd fare
a whole lot better.

24:00.786 --> 24:02.824
In fact, you'd survive without injury.

24:02.944 --> 24:05.341
If you jump off to the side,
you would survive.

24:09.152 --> 24:12.400
- This one's looking plausible.
- So, plausible by proximity.

24:17.705 --> 24:19.232
So, what have we learned
from this experiment?

24:19.352 --> 24:23.858
Well, when selecting a household item
as a potential bomb-disposal area,

24:23.978 --> 24:26.840
It's important to look at
where the energy's going to go.

24:26.960 --> 24:30.066
Completely containing all
that energy is a very bad idea,

24:30.068 --> 24:33.570
But if you find an item that can focus
the energy in one direction,

24:33.572 --> 24:38.140
Like the mattress or the aquarium
or in the garbage truck

24:38.260 --> 24:41.682
And you jump away from
that direction and hit the deck,

24:41.802 --> 24:44.381
You significantly increase
your chances of survival.

24:44.383 --> 24:47.171
You guys, we're here,
we have a truck,

24:47.291 --> 24:49.712
We have experts,
and we have a lot of explosives.

24:49.832 --> 24:51.621
I say we do
this "mythbusters" style.

24:51.623 --> 24:54.558
- Let's make it disappear?
- It's time to go boom.

24:54.560 --> 24:58.504
Fire in the hole.
Fire in the hole. Fire in the hole.

24:59.131 --> 25:05.603
Five, four, three, two, one!

25:11.145 --> 25:13.625
Please, do not try what
you're about to see at home.

25:13.745 --> 25:16.435
The things that we do on this
show are extremely dangerous.

25:16.555 --> 25:18.269
We have experts to keep us safe.

25:22.386 --> 25:23.015
Pull.

25:27.475 --> 25:30.415
We're done with our target practice
On fake grenades...

25:32.150 --> 25:34.313
...So now it's time
to break out the real ones.

25:35.861 --> 25:37.539
Looks pretty innocuous,
doesn't it?

25:38.398 --> 25:40.559
It is, in fact, pretty small
compared to some of the things

25:40.679 --> 25:42.493
We've blown up over the history
of "mythbusters."

25:48.427 --> 25:52.655
But in fact, these grenades
are incredibly dangerous

25:52.775 --> 25:55.747
And have all of us and
our bomb techs quite nervous.

25:55.867 --> 25:57.744
So, in order to properly
experiment with these,

25:57.864 --> 26:00.855
We have come to a large tract
of private land in gold country,

26:00.975 --> 26:06.830
East of the "mythbusters" shop, where we
have thousands of acres of clear land

26:06.950 --> 26:09.328
All around us in order
to experiment with these.

26:11.325 --> 26:13.389
God, I love operating
the big machinery!

26:16.974 --> 26:18.150
Countless times on this show,

26:18.270 --> 26:20.410
We have armored ourselves behind
these blast chamber panels

26:20.412 --> 26:22.112
To watch
dangerous things happen,

26:22.114 --> 26:25.803
Hopefully right on the other side.
Perfect. That's perfect. I love it.

26:25.923 --> 26:27.784
But this setup,
where our blast chamber panel

26:27.786 --> 26:32.856
Is bordered on both sides
by inch-thick plates of steel,

26:32.858 --> 26:34.557
This is the most armored

26:34.677 --> 26:37.187
We have ever required ourselves
to be out in the field.

26:38.340 --> 26:39.518
That's because it's not

26:39.638 --> 26:42.382
Just an explosive pressure wave
they're dealing with.

26:43.647 --> 26:47.937
The steel body of the grenade
is designed to spray lethal fragments

26:48.057 --> 26:52.042
At over 25,000 feet per second
in every direction.

26:53.047 --> 26:55.844
And the nightmare scenario is a misfire.

26:55.964 --> 26:59.982
To prepare for that, jamie's
recreated his own nightmare.

27:00.734 --> 27:04.521
Normally, bomb-disposal robots
cost around 100 grand or so.

27:04.523 --> 27:07.990
This is my version.
Behold the bomb baby.

27:22.727 --> 27:25.984
This is about a $200
remote-control truck.

27:26.104 --> 27:29.167
I put some servos
for arms, a baby head,

27:29.287 --> 27:31.643
And most importantly,
through this camera,

27:31.763 --> 27:35.691
I'll be able to see what's going on from
the safety of our reinforced bunker.

27:39.683 --> 27:43.464
Those are the safety precautions,
but what's the first test?

27:43.584 --> 27:45.040
Time to wire up
a little control.

27:47.254 --> 27:49.566
Before we get to shooting guns
at these things,

27:49.568 --> 27:51.004
They have a timed fuse.

27:51.124 --> 27:53.068
All right.
Go ahead and, uh, make it go up.

27:53.188 --> 27:55.851
I.E., after you pull the pin
and release the spoon,

27:55.971 --> 27:59.147
There's a few seconds before they
blow up. How many seconds?

28:00.878 --> 28:04.024
That's what we need to determine
by blowing one up.

28:05.472 --> 28:06.587
I knew that was a dud.

28:07.185 --> 28:11.240
But this one isn't. Blaine,
the bomb tech, pulls the pin

28:11.360 --> 28:14.673
And then traps the spoon
of the live grenade in the tube.

28:15.704 --> 28:18.261
When it's raised,
the spoon will pop...

28:18.263 --> 28:19.513
And we're hot!

28:19.633 --> 28:21.097
...The delay fuse will light,

28:21.217 --> 28:25.937
And we'll find out exactly how long
it takes a grenade to go boom.

28:26.057 --> 28:28.805
- I feel quite tense about this.
- We're all ready? - Yep.

28:28.807 --> 28:33.199
Everybody's clear?
Here we go. Going up.

28:44.120 --> 28:45.318
I heard the cap go.

28:50.374 --> 28:51.023
Wow.

28:53.886 --> 28:55.683
I heard stuff hit us.

28:57.514 --> 28:59.078
That was intense, man.

29:10.377 --> 29:12.904
The key reason for this test
was to check our timing

29:13.024 --> 29:15.717
Because we need to know
how much time it takes

29:15.837 --> 29:18.749
For the grenade to go off
once the spoon pops up.

29:20.081 --> 29:21.674
That was five seconds exactly.

29:24.737 --> 29:26.135
Time for some guns.

29:30.212 --> 29:32.182
We're just about to start
firing guns at grenades,

29:32.302 --> 29:33.464
And we've been thinking
about it,

29:33.584 --> 29:35.098
And we think one of three things

29:35.218 --> 29:36.676
Is going to happen
for each of these shots.

29:36.796 --> 29:39.805
Either the round
will render the grenade inert

29:39.925 --> 29:41.678
And maybe decimate it... that's one.

29:41.680 --> 29:44.280
Two is, it could actually detonate it

29:44.282 --> 29:45.607
And explode it in midair.

29:45.727 --> 29:48.407
Or three, it could bring
enough energy into the equation

29:48.527 --> 29:50.770
To actually send the grenade
back to where it came.

29:50.890 --> 29:53.166
I'm curious as to what the
result is actually going to be.

29:53.931 --> 29:56.025
To find out, the setup is simple.

29:58.308 --> 29:59.187
All right, then.

29:59.923 --> 30:02.682
It's been established
an oncoming grenade

30:02.802 --> 30:07.136
Can be taken out, but with live ammo,
they're taking no chances.

30:07.138 --> 30:10.166
Three, two, one, go.

30:11.747 --> 30:12.263
Perfect.

30:12.923 --> 30:14.954
These are the weapons we'll be
using on our grenade today,

30:15.074 --> 30:17.081
And we'll be firing four kinds
of ammunition

30:17.201 --> 30:18.312
Out of these three weapons.

30:18.432 --> 30:22.826
We've got a .308 round,
a .45-caliber pistol round,

30:22.946 --> 30:25.199
And a 12-gauge double-aught buck round.

30:28.228 --> 30:29.339
That looks pretty dead on.

30:29.459 --> 30:31.124
I'll leave the rest
to the bomb squad.

30:33.354 --> 30:34.930
Now, here's where things
get interesting.

30:35.050 --> 30:37.223
I think the .308 round
is going to be by far

30:37.343 --> 30:39.473
The most effective round
against the grenade,

30:40.139 --> 30:43.673
But its rifle is by far
the most difficult one

30:43.675 --> 30:46.399
To hit a grenade in midair with,
While at the other end of the spectrum,

30:46.519 --> 30:49.158
We've got the shotgun,
used for trap shooting,

30:49.278 --> 30:51.605
The easiest weapon to use
to hit a grenade in midair.

30:51.725 --> 30:53.689
But I think this,
the double-aught buck round,

30:53.809 --> 30:55.728
Will be the least effective
against the grenade.

30:56.836 --> 30:59.948
First up, the shotgun
and the lightweight buckshot.

31:01.230 --> 31:02.195
Okay.

31:03.549 --> 31:04.565
Arming.

31:05.097 --> 31:07.843
Will it detonate the
electronically triggered grenade...

31:08.509 --> 31:11.434
Armed.
...Or render it inert...

31:11.436 --> 31:12.167
Three...

31:12.287 --> 31:15.038
...Or even knock it back
30 feet...

31:15.040 --> 31:16.039
...Two...

31:16.041 --> 31:17.319
...Cartoon style?

31:19.977 --> 31:21.380
...One, fire.

31:25.376 --> 31:26.258
Where'd it go?

31:27.340 --> 31:28.189
I don't know.

31:29.270 --> 31:30.219
It didn't go off.

31:30.868 --> 31:31.451
Crap.

31:32.083 --> 31:34.546
We've got ourselves
a situation now.

31:34.929 --> 31:39.351
The grenade's delay fuse was remotely
triggered, Adam fired the shotgun,

31:39.471 --> 31:44.098
And the grenade was knocked off the
stand. But there was no explosion.

31:45.047 --> 31:48.304
And now, somewhere out
there, we have a li...

31:48.306 --> 31:50.993
We have a live grenade.
We cannot leave this bunker

31:51.013 --> 31:53.813
Until we deal with this situation.
You want to fire up the baby?

32:02.660 --> 32:05.206
Turns out that the garbage
truck is plausible.

32:06.588 --> 32:08.315
Our hero would have
survived that blast.

32:09.157 --> 32:12.153
But now it's my favorite time,
where we ramp it up and see

32:12.273 --> 32:14.579
If we can make that
garbage truck not so bombproof.

32:15.874 --> 32:18.966
So, we're going to load it up
with 200 pounds of ANFO

32:19.086 --> 32:20.667
And see if we can make
this thing disappear.

32:20.787 --> 32:22.639
Now, does this
remind you of anything?

32:23.346 --> 32:25.529
This is like cement truck
all over again.

32:26.248 --> 32:28.924
And this is the quarry
where we actually blew it up.

32:32.685 --> 32:35.132
Now, one thing
everybody complains about is,

32:35.252 --> 32:36.680
"you guys don't have a high-speed shot."

32:36.800 --> 32:38.273
We don't have
to worry about that this time.

32:38.393 --> 32:40.191
We have our high-speed
camera standing by,

32:40.311 --> 32:41.419
And we're going
to get that shot.

32:41.539 --> 32:45.234
Isn't that right, Willie?
No pressure.

33:02.240 --> 33:05.252
This is garbage truck
versus a whole lot of ANFO

33:06.767 --> 33:08.232
In three...

33:10.654 --> 33:11.472
...Two...

33:13.091 --> 33:13.619
One.

33:17.671 --> 33:20.147
- Whoa!
- Oh, my god.

33:28.552 --> 33:31.247
The shrapnel got up
to the same height as us!

33:32.213 --> 33:33.561
Whoa!

33:36.046 --> 33:38.081
Woo-hoo!

33:38.083 --> 33:39.732
That was intense.

33:40.316 --> 33:42.299
Now,<i> that's</i> an explosion.

33:43.780 --> 33:50.626
No CGI, no unlikely survivors,
just a whole load of big boom

33:50.628 --> 33:51.728
In glorious,

33:51.848 --> 33:55.076
5,000-frames-a-second
high-speed.

33:55.196 --> 33:58.568
Wow. Way to ramp things up, guys.

33:58.688 --> 34:00.698
Well, that's one way
to take out the trash.

34:00.818 --> 34:02.431
You know what the best part
about all this is?

34:02.874 --> 34:03.906
Through the magic of editing,

34:03.908 --> 34:07.098
We can watch this experiment
over and over again.

34:28.775 --> 34:32.735
Since this story is about grenades, I'm
going to map out how these things work.

34:32.737 --> 34:36.188
This thing on the outside
is called the spoon,

34:36.308 --> 34:39.554
And it's retained
by this ring and a pin.

34:39.674 --> 34:43.201
Now, underneath that
is a spring-loaded striker,

34:43.321 --> 34:46.634
sWhich, once the spoon is released,
the striker is also released,

34:46.754 --> 34:50.304
And it flips over
and creates a spark, like so.

34:51.156 --> 34:54.702
Underneath that spark is a fuse.
It's called the delay fuse,

34:54.822 --> 34:58.872
Which is engineered to burn
for a specific period of time.

34:59.330 --> 35:03.633
Once it burns to its end, which is down
somewhere in the middle of the grenade,

35:03.635 --> 35:08.905
It ignites a small amount of high
explosive that's relatively unstable.

35:08.907 --> 35:12.875
That creates a small blast, which
ignites the rest of the high explosive

35:12.877 --> 35:14.110
That fills the grenade.

35:14.112 --> 35:17.661
At this point, you've basically
got a small pipe bomb

35:17.781 --> 35:20.691
Which has a kill zone
of about 45 feet.

35:25.198 --> 35:26.031
Fire.

35:29.853 --> 35:31.553
- Where'd it go?
- It didn't go off.

35:32.519 --> 35:35.731
But why? Before they fire
up the bomb baby,

35:35.733 --> 35:38.167
Adam fires up
the high-speed camera.

35:38.169 --> 35:40.313
Oh, criminy.
Jamie, come here.

35:41.796 --> 35:45.241
Dude... Watch this.

35:48.711 --> 35:49.708
No... no more grenade.

35:49.828 --> 35:52.415
Well, we don't have
a live grenade out there.

35:52.417 --> 35:55.652
- We've got a bunch of dust.
- Wow.

35:55.772 --> 35:58.022
I totally did not see
that coming.

35:59.202 --> 36:01.290
Darn. I wanted to wake the baby up.

36:04.162 --> 36:05.361
That's a result.

36:05.363 --> 36:10.926
Unbelievably, it seems that you
can indeed shoot a live grenade

36:11.046 --> 36:13.870
And render it inert.

36:13.872 --> 36:14.790
It's amazing.

36:14.910 --> 36:17.373
It disintegrated
the outer casing and then,

36:17.493 --> 36:19.856
Even though this was
within its five-second range,

36:19.976 --> 36:23.960
Did not let it explode the cap,
so the TNT didn't blow up.

36:24.543 --> 36:25.206
Wow.

36:25.326 --> 36:28.416
I would not have called that.
That is amazing.

36:30.499 --> 36:33.183
The double-aught buck completely
disintegrated the grenade,

36:33.303 --> 36:37.326
And that, frankly, surprised us all
because double-aught buck is...

36:37.328 --> 36:40.259
They're little
.38-caliber lead balls,

36:40.379 --> 36:42.496
And you wouldn't think it
would be able to do a whole lot

36:42.616 --> 36:44.843
To a steel grenade,but it did.

36:44.963 --> 36:47.976
It took it completely apart,
and it even took apart

36:48.096 --> 36:50.163
The blasting cap
before it could go off.

36:50.630 --> 36:52.063
An astonishing result.

36:52.413 --> 36:56.028
The fuse was lit electronically,
but before it could detonate,

36:56.148 --> 36:58.895
The buckshot broke up the TNT party.

37:03.545 --> 37:06.816
Next up is a .45-caliber round
pointed at the grenade.

37:07.703 --> 37:09.270
If you remember,
only very recently

37:09.390 --> 37:12.583
We discovered it's a lot harder
to hit a midair grenade

37:12.703 --> 37:16.132
With one of these than it is with one
of those easy shotgun rounds.

37:16.134 --> 37:18.220
As to what it's going to do
to the grenade...

37:18.340 --> 37:24.437
- You ready?
- Okay, .45 acp, three...

37:24.557 --> 37:26.831
...I expect it to have
a very similar effect

37:26.951 --> 37:28.644
As the double-aught buck.
...Two...

37:28.646 --> 37:30.614
I think that the .45-cal round

37:30.734 --> 37:33.082
Is going to turn that thing
right into dust.

37:33.084 --> 37:34.764
...One, fire.

37:36.720 --> 37:37.452
Hey.

37:38.535 --> 37:40.189
It shot it
right off the thing.

37:40.935 --> 37:43.268
The cap went off,
but the grenade didn't.

37:43.388 --> 37:46.702
We knocked the grenade off the stand.
It looks like we split it in half.

37:46.822 --> 37:48.483
So, we didn't stop the cap
from going off,

37:48.603 --> 37:50.600
But we did stop the grenade
from blowing up.

37:50.720 --> 37:52.500
- That's cool.
- That is very cool.

38:01.453 --> 38:04.699
Compared to the buckshot,
the .45-millimeter round

38:04.819 --> 38:07.436
Removed the blasting cap
with surgical precision.

38:08.976 --> 38:12.076
Either way, it's another
myth-confirming result.

38:12.626 --> 38:13.376
What's next?

38:21.261 --> 38:23.611
Now we're going to bring
some real energy to the equation

38:23.731 --> 38:27.228
By using a .308 sniper round,
full metal jacket.

38:28.578 --> 38:29.378
There we go.

38:29.907 --> 38:31.654
As to what this
is going to do to the grenade,

38:31.774 --> 38:34.304
I've been wrong
for everything so far,

38:34.424 --> 38:36.940
So I'm going to say
I have no freakin' idea.

38:39.107 --> 38:42.432
Three, two, one, fire.

38:44.707 --> 38:48.657
- The grenade went boom.
- We didn't disintegrate it. It blew up.

38:50.615 --> 38:51.465
I think so.

38:53.648 --> 38:55.348
- Let's look at the high-speed.
- Okay.

38:58.048 --> 39:01.563
The high-speed camera,
the scalpel, the microscope,

39:01.683 --> 39:05.065
The light, the multi-tool
for tackling time.

39:05.615 --> 39:06.428
There it is.

39:06.548 --> 39:10.999
- And what it shows is... - The grenade
ignited the second that it penetrated.

39:12.516 --> 39:13.699
That is a thing.

39:16.882 --> 39:20.912
The blasting cap inside a grenade
is actually somewhat shock-sensitive,

39:21.032 --> 39:24.029
And the .308 round is a very,
very high-speed round.

39:25.082 --> 39:27.504
And that speed translates
directly to a certain amount

39:27.624 --> 39:28.998
Of energy being brought
to the equation.

39:29.404 --> 39:31.251
And in our case, the .308 round,

39:31.371 --> 39:35.254
The very instant it touched
the exterior of our grenade,

39:35.374 --> 39:39.357
That shock caused the entire
thing to detonate early.

39:39.674 --> 39:43.837
It was a very, very powerful reaction
And an instant one.

39:43.957 --> 39:46.820
Yep. It's the second
of three potential results

39:46.940 --> 39:49.672
And the most common
of the cinematic techniques,

39:49.792 --> 39:51.722
The midair explosion.

39:52.772 --> 39:57.605
But let's think about that for a second,
because if that ignited the grenade

39:57.725 --> 40:03.465
At any closer than 45 feet, which is the
kill zone for a grenade, you're dead.

40:04.068 --> 40:09.106
Further than 45 feet, it starts
to become almost impossible

40:09.226 --> 40:14.356
To make a shot like that.
Yes, in theory, it's possible, but...

40:14.476 --> 40:17.659
I would duck.
Personally, I would just duck.

40:22.518 --> 40:23.251
That worked!

40:23.667 --> 40:28.441
So, to recap our final results,
The high-powered rounds, the .308,

40:28.561 --> 40:30.391
Actually detonated the grenade,

40:30.511 --> 40:33.929
Which means that if it's within 50 feet
of you, you're dead, sucker.

40:33.931 --> 40:38.322
But the low-powered rounds, the .45
and especially the shotgun,

40:38.442 --> 40:40.456
Both rendered
the grenades inert.

40:40.576 --> 40:43.241
The shotgun's even
kept the blasting cap

40:43.361 --> 40:47.071
From going off, pretty much
the exact polar opposite

40:47.191 --> 40:49.724
Of what we thought was going
to happen. Isn't that cool?

40:54.965 --> 40:57.249
So, where did we stand
with the original question

40:57.369 --> 41:00.679
Of whether you can protect yourself
from a grenade using a gun?

41:00.799 --> 41:03.481
I think we found handily that
that is totally the case.

41:03.601 --> 41:06.079
Moreover, the weapon
that rendered the grenade

41:06.199 --> 41:07.062
The most inert

41:07.182 --> 41:09.879
Was the one that was easiest to shoot
it out of the air with, the shotgun.

41:09.999 --> 41:11.392
Yep. So, it's plausible.

41:11.512 --> 41:12.976
Totally plausible.
Let's get out of here.
