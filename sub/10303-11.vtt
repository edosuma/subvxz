01:20.880 --> 01:23.440
Hear ye. Hear ye.

01:23.680 --> 01:26.638
I now call to order this meeting
of NO MA'AM:

01:26.880 --> 01:31.317
National Organization of Men
Against Amazonian Masterhood.

01:32.680 --> 01:35.911
Brother Jefferson will read the minutes
of our last meeting.

01:39.560 --> 01:42.552
8:01, 8:02...

01:42.800 --> 01:45.075
...8:03.

01:46.320 --> 01:48.197
The same damn joke every week.

01:48.440 --> 01:52.353
Hey, every time Bob Rooney
plays the armpit tuba, you all laugh.

01:52.640 --> 01:56.189
Well, that's funny. Let it rip, Bob.

02:06.400 --> 02:10.632
Anyway, last meeting we bitched
about the baseball strike...

02:10.880 --> 02:13.235
...drank beer, peed...

02:13.640 --> 02:16.313
...drank more beer, peed again...

02:16.520 --> 02:18.397
...then hurried home
to drink beer and pee.

02:20.200 --> 02:23.510
Thank you, brother Jefferson.
Now on to new business.

02:23.760 --> 02:29.551
As you know, a new member,
our very own Griff, is being initiated.

02:29.800 --> 02:33.952
So, Sergeant at Arms Ike,
would you bring the plebe in?

02:38.720 --> 02:42.429
- Rookie.
- New guy.

02:44.640 --> 02:48.872
Now, Griff, you've survived
the other initiation rites.

02:49.120 --> 02:52.430
The purchasing of panty shields
in broad daylight.

02:53.720 --> 02:58.236
The attending of a Julio concert in wig
and matching ensemble.

02:59.120 --> 03:02.829
Are you ready for the third
and final challenge?

03:03.200 --> 03:05.589
Hey, I've got an ex-wife
and I work in a shoe store.

03:05.840 --> 03:07.956
I feel no pain.

03:09.640 --> 03:14.475
Then Sergeant at Arms Ike,
please escort Griff to the bath.

03:14.720 --> 03:19.236
Excuse me. I mean the chamber
of the damned, please.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.714
Hey, Al, are you sure we should put
Griff through this?

03:25.960 --> 03:29.714
Yeah, the human mind
is only made of flesh and bone.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.359
Hey.

03:31.640 --> 03:34.950
NO MA'AM isn't like California.
You can't just walk in.

03:36.920 --> 03:39.275
Our standards have to be tough.

03:39.680 --> 03:41.636
If a man can't stand
a two-hour videotape...

03:41.840 --> 03:43.398
...of Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman...

03:43.600 --> 03:46.160
...he's not strong enough
to be in NO MA'AM.

03:53.760 --> 03:55.318
Now on to new business.

03:55.840 --> 03:58.832
Men, we have got to do something
about this baseball strike.

03:59.040 --> 04:02.112
- Amen.
- It's affecting the way we live.

04:02.360 --> 04:05.875
Yeah. I had to take my wife
to the beauty parlour.

04:06.440 --> 04:09.079
I had to take my wife to the opera.

04:09.840 --> 04:12.673
I had to take my wife.

04:20.279 --> 04:24.910
Make the Indians kill her, please.
Make the Indians kill her.

04:26.240 --> 04:28.037
Now, if the players
don't want to play...

04:28.240 --> 04:30.390
...I don't give a damn,
we don' t need them.

04:30.640 --> 04:33.234
We can play with ourselves.

04:36.480 --> 04:38.755
So the meeting is dismissed?

04:40.120 --> 04:42.429
Ike, go in there with Griff.

04:48.880 --> 04:50.836
So we're gonna play baseball?

04:51.120 --> 04:53.509
- We are.
- Where?

04:53.760 --> 04:55.796
How about Wrigley Field?

04:56.040 --> 04:59.430
Yeah. The Cubs ain't using it.

05:00.120 --> 05:02.680
They weren't using it
before the strike.

05:04.320 --> 05:07.915
- Oh, my God.
- They're bathing at the river.

05:11.080 --> 05:14.277
So, what if they don't let us use
Wrigley? It's private property.

05:14.520 --> 05:18.149
Oh, come on. Who's gonna stop
a bunch of great American guys...

05:18.400 --> 05:21.836
...from playing
the great American pastime?

05:32.040 --> 05:34.713
Well, I mean, except for the police.

05:35.480 --> 05:38.950
Well, at least it was great to hear
the crack of the bat again.

05:39.200 --> 05:41.430
That was a nightstick.

05:43.480 --> 05:46.677
But you know, it was good
to get outside and play a little baseball.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.233
We pitched well, we hit well.

05:48.440 --> 05:51.193
And man, Jefferson,
I didn't realize you could run so fast.

05:52.600 --> 05:56.434
Well, you run faster
with a police dog in your back pocket.

05:58.120 --> 06:00.031
Well, well, well.

06:00.280 --> 06:02.589
Hey, Officer Dan.
What are you doing here?

06:02.840 --> 06:04.717
Same thing you do
at the shoe store, Al.

06:04.960 --> 06:07.918
- Waiting for quitting time?
- Exactly.

06:08.760 --> 06:10.637
And it's ribs night.

06:12.920 --> 06:16.310
So, hear you were busted
for climbing the vines at Wrigley Field.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.319
We miss baseball.

06:19.040 --> 06:21.156
I miss good sex.

06:21.960 --> 06:24.793
You don't see me climbing my wife.

06:26.520 --> 06:29.432
Anyhow, I came to tell you
you've been sprung.

06:29.680 --> 06:31.716
What? By who?

06:31.960 --> 06:35.077
I am so sick of coming down here.

06:35.320 --> 06:37.311
The wives.

06:44.160 --> 06:48.153
There they are. The roids of summer.

06:48.840 --> 06:51.513
No conjugal visits.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.308
Jefferson D'Arcy.

06:54.560 --> 06:59.873
Now, I expect Al to be involved in some
receding "hair-brained" scheme...

07:00.120 --> 07:01.519
...but what are you in for?

07:02.520 --> 07:07.958
- I was... I was on my way to a...
- Job interview.

07:08.160 --> 07:11.118
- Job interview when suddenly I was...
- Kidnapped.

07:11.360 --> 07:14.670
- Kidnapped by a gang of...

07:14.920 --> 07:17.150
- Chickens.
- Chickens.

07:25.360 --> 07:28.432
But real chickens, not you.

07:29.800 --> 07:33.873
You know, Al, I've thought about
letting you spend the night in jail.

07:34.120 --> 07:37.396
Well, thank you.
You know, it's ribs night.

07:38.080 --> 07:40.071
Not tonight.
We have tickets for the theatre.

07:40.280 --> 07:44.353
That's right.
Tonight it's Ace Ventura: The Musical...

07:45.000 --> 07:48.879
...starring Nell Carter, Joyce DeWitt
and that guy that played Horshack.

07:49.120 --> 07:50.917
He's Ace.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.958
I confess to killing
a bunch of people...

07:58.240 --> 08:00.356
...and eating them.

08:01.600 --> 08:04.512
Then you've already had your ribs.

08:08.080 --> 08:11.231
Breaking into Wrigley Field.
How else could you embarrass me?

08:11.480 --> 08:14.472
Well, I could pull up the shade
when you're taking a shower.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.429
Daddy.

08:24.040 --> 08:26.349
I am so proud of you.

08:26.600 --> 08:31.116
Now I can tell all my friends my dad's
an ex-con instead of a shoe salesman.

08:31.600 --> 08:33.750
You see that, Peg? She's proud of me.

08:34.000 --> 08:38.789
Yeah. She's also proud
of her shiny, shiny shoes.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.230
They're shiny. Look.

08:42.840 --> 08:44.956
Come on, Peg. So we had a little fun.

08:45.200 --> 08:47.191
It's not like anybody knows
about this.

08:48.600 --> 08:50.670
Hey, Dad, look.

08:54.120 --> 08:56.236
You made the headline
on the Sports page. Look.

08:56.440 --> 08:58.795
"Loons invade Wrigley Field."

08:59.040 --> 09:00.598
What?

09:01.200 --> 09:03.589
Damn press.
Look, they misspelled my name.

09:03.840 --> 09:06.308
"Al Burdy."

09:06.680 --> 09:08.955
Al Burdy?

09:09.320 --> 09:11.709
Al Burdy.

09:12.120 --> 09:13.633
I like it.

09:13.880 --> 09:16.235
Peggy Burdy.

09:16.440 --> 09:18.635
I really like it.

09:23.560 --> 09:25.994
Hi, I'm Joe Morgan.

09:31.720 --> 09:34.996
- Are you Al Burdy?
- No, no.

09:35.200 --> 09:39.113
I believe the Burdy you're looking for
is the dodo over there.

09:40.400 --> 09:42.311
Peg, that's Joe Morgan.

09:42.560 --> 09:45.438
Kids, that's... That's Joe Morgan.

09:45.720 --> 09:47.915
Mike Piazza, that's Joe...

09:48.200 --> 09:51.033
Joe Morgan, that's Mike Piazza.

09:55.680 --> 09:57.352
Well, what are you guys doing here?

09:57.600 --> 10:00.114
Just trying to make an honest buck.

10:01.040 --> 10:03.076
And with just about
every sport on strike...

10:03.280 --> 10:05.430
...you guys are the biggest
news story going.

10:05.680 --> 10:09.468
- Mind if I do a little interview?
- No problem.

10:09.800 --> 10:14.271
He tries to sell shoes.
He tries to satisfy his wife.

10:14.520 --> 10:18.149
He does neither. Back to you, Joe.

10:18.440 --> 10:20.396
And who is this lovely lady?

10:20.640 --> 10:22.915
That's my daughter, Kelly.

10:30.320 --> 10:33.869
The redhead here
is her mother, Rodan.

10:35.960 --> 10:38.394
Oh, sure, go ahead, Joe.
Interview away.

10:38.640 --> 10:41.712
- Turn on the camera.
- How does this thing work again?

10:41.960 --> 10:45.555
Turn it on where I'm talking, off when
you think you have something to say.

10:45.800 --> 10:47.199
Got it.

10:47.440 --> 10:50.398
We're here with the leader
of the Wrigley Field break-in boys...

10:50.600 --> 10:53.353
...AI Burdy.
- That's Bundy.

10:53.560 --> 10:56.996
Burdy, let me ask you this. Why?

10:57.200 --> 10:59.395
I've asked him that myself
over the years.

10:59.600 --> 11:00.999
He says he's either too tired...

11:01.200 --> 11:04.988
Pay no attention
to the big red machine, Joe.

11:07.480 --> 11:09.835
Why did we play baseball?

11:10.080 --> 11:11.991
For the love of the game.

11:12.240 --> 11:14.800
Just like every American husband.

11:15.040 --> 11:17.838
It's all right seven months
out of the year...

11:18.080 --> 11:20.594
...to sit on the couch
with a bowl of pretzels...

11:20.840 --> 11:24.310
...and a frosty cold one
and watch baseball.

11:24.560 --> 11:27.870
Since that right has been violated...

11:29.000 --> 11:32.470
...and the owners and players have not
been able to resolve their differences...

11:32.720 --> 11:37.669
...we just simply decided
to play the game ourselves.

11:38.160 --> 11:40.594
Unfortunately, our audience
might have missed that...

11:40.840 --> 11:44.515
...since the camera's
suddenly shooting Baywatch.

11:48.080 --> 11:50.548
Anyway, Al,
it seems that you're not alone.

11:50.800 --> 11:53.030
Are you aware that a challenge
has been issued...

11:53.240 --> 11:57.153
...by another group of out-of-shape
fat guys from St. Louis?

11:57.880 --> 12:00.599
What? Wait, you mean
another team of geezers...

12:00.800 --> 12:03.314
...wants to play my dad's geezers?

12:03.560 --> 12:05.232
Well, that couldn't possibly happen.

12:05.440 --> 12:09.319
- We have tickets for the theatre...
- Silencio, Consuela.

12:12.160 --> 12:14.549
Well, Al, do you accept the challenge
from St. Louis?

12:14.800 --> 12:19.510
In a word, Joe, abso-freaking-lutely.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.679
There you have it, sports fans.

12:26.920 --> 12:30.117
This year's Major League Baseball
season may be at an end...

12:30.360 --> 12:33.193
...but the game continues on.

12:38.160 --> 12:41.550
I was just trying
my auto-focus thingy.

12:43.320 --> 12:45.709
Baseball is America's game.

12:45.960 --> 12:49.873
It belongs to the people
and the people is us.

12:50.120 --> 12:53.908
So I, Al Burdy, say,
let there be baseball.

12:54.160 --> 12:56.958
Let there be life.

13:01.400 --> 13:05.029
You know, I can't believe Dad and
the rest of the Bad News Butt Cracks...

13:05.240 --> 13:07.037
...are trying to form
their own league...

13:07.240 --> 13:10.073
Trying to form their own league
and tour across the country.

13:10.280 --> 13:13.192
Well, they did beat Street Louis.

13:16.480 --> 13:19.040
That's St. Louis, honey.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.719
I guess this league of his
is gonna be a success after all.

13:24.920 --> 13:27.434
Bud, this is your father
we're talking about.

13:27.680 --> 13:30.513
When has he ever done
anything successful?

13:31.280 --> 13:32.872
Family...

13:39.240 --> 13:40.798
...guess what you're looking at.

13:41.080 --> 13:43.071
The sultan of sweat?

13:44.640 --> 13:47.518
That's right, Peg. Charge the mound.

13:48.320 --> 13:51.118
But they're lining up for us.
This thing could really be big.

13:51.320 --> 13:52.753
We've even got a sponsor.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.230
Who would be stupid enough
to sponsor you guys?

13:55.480 --> 13:59.393
- Only the wealthiest man in Chicago.
- Michael Jordan?

14:00.520 --> 14:04.433
Wealthier.
And my guy can hit the curve ball.

14:04.880 --> 14:08.429
Family, allow me to introduce to you
the owner of our team...

14:08.640 --> 14:10.676
...the Chicago Cleavage...

14:11.240 --> 14:14.755
...and the owner
of the best damn nudie bar in town...

14:15.000 --> 14:18.151
...Akbar Johnson.

14:24.160 --> 14:26.276
Greetings all.

14:26.960 --> 14:28.552
Bud?

14:34.360 --> 14:37.352
Your team is sponsored
by a nudie bar?

14:37.600 --> 14:41.513
Yeah. Not just our team, Peg,
but every team in the league.

14:41.760 --> 14:44.149
The Boston Bazooms...

14:44.400 --> 14:46.834
...the New Jersey Nay-Nays...

14:47.080 --> 14:50.072
...the Buffalo Bodacious Ta-Tas...

14:50.320 --> 14:53.437
...and the San Francisco Guys.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.272
And you know
what the best part is, Peg?

14:57.560 --> 15:00.074
Your uniform has a trap door?

15:00.840 --> 15:03.513
If only the couch had one, Peg.

15:04.360 --> 15:06.191
All our games will be away games.

15:06.440 --> 15:09.000
I'll be gone six weeks.
I made up the schedule myself.

15:09.760 --> 15:11.079
Isn't that great, Peg?

15:11.320 --> 15:13.754
You mean, we won't be together
for six weeks?

15:13.960 --> 15:15.439
Yes.

15:15.680 --> 15:19.036
It's like the second honeymoon
I've always wanted.

15:19.400 --> 15:23.154
And, kids, I haven't forgotten you.
I have a special surprise.

15:23.400 --> 15:26.915
- We have to go with you?
- Hell, no.

15:27.280 --> 15:30.989
No, but if this thing works out, Daddy
will be gone for many, many years.

15:31.240 --> 15:34.232
And there's something very important
I need you to do.

15:34.640 --> 15:36.073
What?

15:43.760 --> 15:47.799
Something about this makes me want
to tell old high school football stories.

15:48.640 --> 15:53.316
Well, you're lucky.
I have a sudden urge to read Big 'Uns.

16:01.320 --> 16:02.878
I don't care what anybody says.

16:03.120 --> 16:05.190
This has gotta be the worst job
in the world.

16:05.440 --> 16:08.079
No, I've got the worst job
in the world.

16:12.320 --> 16:14.754
Kelly, it's Bret Saberhagen.

16:15.680 --> 16:18.911
Well, then why does his nametag
say Bobby Bonilla?

16:19.840 --> 16:21.796
He called in sick.

16:30.520 --> 16:33.318
Hey, Saberhagen, is that your
pizza truck in the red zone?

16:33.560 --> 16:37.439
If I don't get this here in 30 minutes,
they'll take it out of my cheque.

16:37.640 --> 16:41.519
At least you get a cheque.
I get paid in mall dollars.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.592
Danny, can I bribe you with a pizza?

16:44.840 --> 16:47.354
Let me check
my security guard handbook.

16:48.080 --> 16:49.433
Yup.

16:49.680 --> 16:54.151
- Hey, wait a minute. That's our pizza.
- Tell it to the commissioner.

17:29.760 --> 17:34.515
Burdy. Burdy. Burdy.
Burdy. Burdy. Burdy.

17:34.760 --> 17:36.591
That's Bundy.

17:36.840 --> 17:40.196
Burdy. Burdy. Burdy. Burdy.

17:58.200 --> 18:00.839
- Can I have a break now?
- No.

18:02.920 --> 18:04.990
- Can I have a break now?
- Absolutely.

18:05.240 --> 18:08.994
Thanks. Where the hell's Saberhagen
with my lasagne?

18:19.200 --> 18:20.599
How does this thing work again?

18:20.840 --> 18:24.389
That's it.
Next time, I'm hiring a hockey guy.

18:27.320 --> 18:30.392
A fat woman
came into the shoe store today.

18:31.200 --> 18:33.953
And Bud still looked up her dress.

18:38.480 --> 18:39.913
Yeah, like I could help it.

18:40.160 --> 18:43.152
Her dress, it was everywhere.

18:43.800 --> 18:47.395
Hi, Mom. You look nice. How come?

18:48.040 --> 18:50.713
Well, today is the end
of your father's road trip...

18:50.960 --> 18:55.192
...and hopefully the beginning
of his seven-minute home stand.

18:56.080 --> 18:58.992
So, Mrs. Burdy,
this must be a big moment for you.

18:59.240 --> 19:00.753
I bet you miss the big guy.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.434
Oh, yes.

19:03.960 --> 19:06.474
I also miss my husband.

19:07.600 --> 19:10.831
You know, the point is, that when
a man has been gone this long...

19:11.080 --> 19:14.038
...any man,
it's just good to have him back.

19:21.080 --> 19:25.198
Mom, that 's not Dad,
that's Dave Winfield.

19:25.440 --> 19:27.715
- Mind your business.
- Mind your business.

19:37.520 --> 19:40.637
Oh, the places I've been,
the people I've seen.

19:40.880 --> 19:44.509
But when you get right down to it,
there's no place like home.

19:44.760 --> 19:46.876
Come to Papa.

19:47.800 --> 19:49.518
Look out.

19:50.120 --> 19:53.829
Oh, Dave, I missed you so much.

19:55.240 --> 19:58.118
We've gotta do something
about this strike.

19:58.960 --> 20:00.188
Welcome home, Al.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.631
It's refreshing to see someone
who plays just for the love of the game.

20:04.200 --> 20:05.872
Well, it isn't just me, Joe.

20:06.120 --> 20:09.032
I mean, kids who play sandlot ball,
do they play for money?

20:09.280 --> 20:12.955
College kids without scholarships,
do they play for money?

20:13.160 --> 20:15.071
Anything you do for love, Joe...

20:15.280 --> 20:17.271
...money should never be
a consideration.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.916
So the fact that Akbar
and the other owners...

20:20.120 --> 20:22.475
...sold the TV rights
for your championship game...

20:22.680 --> 20:24.591
...for $3 million doesn't bother you?

20:24.880 --> 20:28.395
Not in the slightest, Joe.
And I've said this many times before.

20:28.640 --> 20:32.076
I've always played the game for...
Three million dollars?

20:32.320 --> 20:34.629
Does Akbar not take the risk?

20:35.200 --> 20:39.398
- Does Burdy not bring in the fans?
- The owners are going broke.

20:39.640 --> 20:41.551
- Show us your books.
- No.

20:41.760 --> 20:43.159
We're the players. You need us.

20:43.360 --> 20:44.759
We are the owners. You need us.

20:44.960 --> 20:47.076
- Players. Players.
- Owners. Owners.

20:47.280 --> 20:48.872
- Players. Players.
- Owners. Owners.

20:49.080 --> 20:50.354
Players.

20:52.640 --> 20:54.358
Well, it was made official today.

20:54.560 --> 20:57.154
The owners and players
of the National Nudie Bar League...

20:57.360 --> 20:59.828
...failed to reach agreement
on player compensation...

21:00.040 --> 21:01.917
...for the upcoming
championship series...

21:02.120 --> 21:06.193
...prompting yet another in a string of
unfortunate season-ending walk outs.

21:06.440 --> 21:10.797
So to recap, baseball is on strik e.
Hock ey is on strik e.

21:11.040 --> 21:13.713
And Saturday Night Live
just won't end.

21:13.960 --> 21:17.475
That's three strik es and we're out.
I'm Joe Morgan.

21:17.680 --> 21:21.992
We now join Filipino slap fighting
already in progress.

21:23.320 --> 21:27.518
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.678
I now call to order this meeting...

21:29.880 --> 21:35.000
...of the National Organization of Men
Against Amazonian Masterhood.

21:35.240 --> 21:38.391
Brother Jefferson will read
the minutes of the last meeting.

21:38.960 --> 21:41.872
- 8:01, 8:02...
- No.

21:42.120 --> 21:47.069
...8:03, 8:04, 8...

21:48.305 --> 21:54.606
