WEBVTT

00:03.436 --> 00:05.739
Previously, on Heels...

00:05.839 --> 00:07.007
Willie around?

00:07.107 --> 00:08.808
Not at the moment.
Can I help you?

00:08.908 --> 00:10.910
She leave anything for me?

00:10.910 --> 00:12.612
You're not gonna be
some gushing fanboy

00:12.712 --> 00:14.214
all day, are you?

00:14.314 --> 00:16.783
Just go to the bar and get me
two goddamn martinis.

00:16.883 --> 00:18.298
Whatever the fuck you say.

00:18.418 --> 00:20.487
Crystal.
Meet Elle Dorado.

00:20.587 --> 00:21.588
Real name's Tanya.

00:21.588 --> 00:22.822
Elle's a pro.

00:22.822 --> 00:24.491
Oh!

00:24.591 --> 00:25.592
So are you.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.827
Crystal! Crystal!

00:27.927 --> 00:29.162
It's granddad's crown.

00:29.262 --> 00:30.597
It's all right, buddy.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.098
Your dad won't care.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.133
I got this idea.

00:33.233 --> 00:34.601
Could use some help.

00:36.970 --> 00:38.805
You help me restore
my honor in the ring

00:38.905 --> 00:42.275
with a cross-promotion
between the DWL and Dystopia,

00:42.275 --> 00:45.545
or I hit you back and take
every goddamn dollar you make

00:45.645 --> 00:47.714
for the rest
of your goddamn life.

00:48.014 --> 00:49.682
Yeah! Yeah!

00:52.619 --> 00:55.221
Oh!

00:55.321 --> 00:59.059
I am... the Condamned.

Listen up, folks!

02:54.774 --> 02:59.145
It's "con-damned."

02:59.245 --> 03:02.382
Do not conjure incorrectly.

03:02.482 --> 03:05.118
You risk offending
that bewildering barnstormer.

03:05.218 --> 03:07.187
His voice
may have been garbled,

03:07.287 --> 03:08.955
but that specter
can't possibly share

03:09.055 --> 03:10.690
a name with the most high,

03:10.790 --> 03:15.228
for the most high
has cast that demon below.

03:15.328 --> 03:16.496
Say it with me.

03:16.596 --> 03:17.597
Con!

03:17.697 --> 03:18.798
Con!

03:18.898 --> 03:19.832
Damned!

03:19.933 --> 03:20.733
Damned!

03:20.833 --> 03:21.935
All together!

03:22.035 --> 03:23.803
Condamned!

03:23.903 --> 03:25.205
Condamned! Condamned!

03:25.305 --> 03:29.642
Condamned! Condamned!
Condamned!

03:29.642 --> 03:31.811
For those of you wondering,
"What was that?"

03:31.911 --> 03:33.446
that was the Condamned.

03:33.546 --> 03:36.029
Come back next week
as we peel back the mystery

03:36.149 --> 03:38.084
of he who fell
from the skylight.

03:38.184 --> 03:39.519
This is Eddie Earl
with Bobby Pin,

03:39.619 --> 03:41.588
signing off
from Duffy, Georgia,

03:41.688 --> 03:44.023
the cradle of the greatest
wrestling in America,

03:44.123 --> 03:45.959
the DWL.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.427
What the heck was that?

03:47.527 --> 03:49.162
Uh, that was the Condamned.

03:49.262 --> 03:50.663
Well, they-they could
have told us that.

03:50.763 --> 03:52.398
A heads-up
would have been nice.

03:52.498 --> 03:56.569
Condamned!
Condamned! Condamned!

03:56.669 --> 03:59.072
Jack or Ace tell you
that was the fucking finish?

03:59.172 --> 04:00.573
No. They kayfabed all of us.

04:00.673 --> 04:01.941
Tryin' to keep us on our toes.

04:02.041 --> 04:03.376
I almost had a heart attack.

04:03.476 --> 04:04.811
I know CPR, if it ever happens.

04:04.911 --> 04:06.412
- It's gonna happen!
- Listen, guys.

04:06.512 --> 04:08.147
Ace is my daughter's godfather,

04:08.248 --> 04:09.782
and I didn't even know
he was in town.

04:09.882 --> 04:11.351
Willie, if y'all knew
anything about that,

04:11.451 --> 04:12.785
it's bullshit
you kept it a secret.

04:12.885 --> 04:15.455
Rule #1 of kayfabe is
don't kayfabe the boys!

04:15.555 --> 04:17.323
Secrets are only secrets
if you don't tell anyone.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.325
Willie, a company
of compadres are only

04:19.425 --> 04:21.127
true compadres
when we know what

04:21.227 --> 04:22.528
we are all compadre-ing about.

04:22.629 --> 04:25.098
A mysterious seraph
riding in on a chariot?

04:25.198 --> 04:26.766
'Twas glorious. Admit it.

04:26.866 --> 04:27.867
I don't gotta admit shit.

04:27.967 --> 04:29.435
- Bill--
- Bobby.

04:29.535 --> 04:31.170
Don't know the word "seraph."

04:31.271 --> 04:33.473
Seraph's a high-ranking
angel, young Bob.

04:33.573 --> 04:34.941
He's an angel, but he's damned?

04:35.041 --> 04:36.175
Condamned.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.177
So he's a fallen angel,
like Satan.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.445
Satan?

04:39.545 --> 04:41.314
Nobody told me Ace
was playing Satan.

04:41.414 --> 04:42.915
No. Ace isn't playing Satan.

04:43.016 --> 04:44.250
So then what is he?

04:44.350 --> 04:45.618
He's whatever Jack
and Ace say he is,

04:45.718 --> 04:47.387
and when they tell us,
that's when we'll know.

04:47.487 --> 04:48.755
Well, as a reporter,
I'm supposed to ask questions.

04:48.855 --> 04:50.790
During the show.
The show's over, dummy.

04:50.890 --> 04:52.025
Good shit tonight.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.026
We gotta cover
this entire night

04:53.126 --> 04:54.060
for the podcast.

04:54.160 --> 04:55.528
Yeah? Write up some notes.

04:55.628 --> 04:56.729
Text me.

04:56.829 --> 04:58.264
Where's my brother?

04:58.364 --> 05:00.300
That was a top-five
DWL moment right there!

05:00.400 --> 05:01.868
Do you feel good?

05:01.968 --> 05:03.269
You should feel good.

05:03.369 --> 05:04.817
- Think it got over?
- Course it got over.

05:04.937 --> 05:05.972
Big time.

05:06.072 --> 05:07.854
Crowd was gasping and shouting.

05:07.974 --> 05:09.642
Ace Spade is back.

05:09.742 --> 05:11.678
Yeah, well, it's not
like it's me, Ace Spade.

05:11.778 --> 05:13.913
It's supposed to be this thing
where i-it's not me,

05:14.013 --> 05:16.883
so it doesn't have
to be me, but... yeah.

05:16.983 --> 05:17.884
It felt good.

05:17.984 --> 05:18.885
It should've.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.253
It was good.

05:20.353 --> 05:22.889
Well, it's a first step anyway.

05:26.125 --> 05:27.193
Oh, shit.

05:27.293 --> 05:28.494
- What?
- Hey.

05:29.395 --> 05:30.797
Told you
we should have told Gully.

05:30.897 --> 05:32.165
Wasn't his business.

05:32.265 --> 05:33.933
I don't think
that's gonna fly.

05:34.033 --> 05:35.335
Bill?

05:35.435 --> 05:37.704
Coming, dear.

05:37.804 --> 05:40.707
That was a damn entrance.

05:40.807 --> 05:43.276
Wasn't sure
I could pull it off.

05:43.376 --> 05:44.477
Butterflies.

05:44.577 --> 05:45.778
Emotions, you know.

05:45.878 --> 05:48.081
Hey, it's good
to have you back, man.

05:50.917 --> 05:52.785
I just wanna say,
if you need to talk to anyone

05:52.885 --> 05:55.021
about anything,
I'm-I'm here for ya.

05:55.121 --> 05:58.324
Even... even if I am
a married man with a baby,

05:58.324 --> 06:01.027
that don't make me,
uh... I don't know,

06:01.127 --> 06:03.930
not your friend.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.998
You know, part of the reason
I un-retired and came back

06:06.099 --> 06:10.503
was to do this with you,
so just saying reach out.

06:12.572 --> 06:15.708
You're a good friend, Jim.

06:15.808 --> 06:17.243
I haven't been one
to you lately.

06:17.343 --> 06:19.345
Oh, cut the shit.

06:19.445 --> 06:21.347
I'm not trying to have
a long conversation.

06:21.447 --> 06:22.929
Not here, anyway.

06:23.049 --> 06:26.953
Just, uh, stop by
and visit your goddaughter.

06:28.187 --> 06:29.389
I'm gonna.

06:29.489 --> 06:30.923
I promise.

06:32.658 --> 06:34.861
Oh, and be ready
to stay the night,

06:34.961 --> 06:38.331
'cause we're goin' out,
and you're babysitting.

06:46.572 --> 06:48.508
Pick your poison.

06:48.608 --> 06:51.110
I'd take one of each,
but, uh, I gotta head out.

06:51.210 --> 06:53.546
One beer.

06:53.646 --> 06:55.248
Can't. Road life.

06:55.348 --> 06:56.749
Get in, get out, move on.

06:56.849 --> 06:58.551
Break a few hearts
along the way, if I'm lucky.

06:58.651 --> 07:02.355
Tanya, you were...
so great tonight.

07:02.455 --> 07:04.223
I-I'll push Jack
to bring you back.

07:04.323 --> 07:05.858
Focus on them pushing you.

07:05.958 --> 07:07.894
Only way to improve
is by improving.

07:07.994 --> 07:08.928
Take care of your knees.

07:09.028 --> 07:10.263
Best advice I never got.

07:10.363 --> 07:13.199
Oh, and check for peepholes.

07:13.299 --> 07:14.567
Really?

07:16.436 --> 07:17.637
Huh.

07:19.806 --> 07:21.841
Thanks for being so cool.

07:34.020 --> 07:38.004
Condamned, what are you?

07:38.124 --> 07:39.392
I'm vengeance.

07:39.492 --> 07:42.195
Isn't that what Batman says?

07:42.295 --> 07:45.097
I taught it to Batman.

07:45.198 --> 07:47.834
Taught him everything he knows.

07:47.934 --> 07:48.968
Get it!

07:50.536 --> 07:52.305
Could you sign this for me?

07:52.405 --> 07:53.639
Thank you.

07:54.407 --> 07:56.108
I appreciate it, man.

08:14.961 --> 08:16.329
Gully's pissed.

08:16.429 --> 08:18.798
Gully's always pissed.

08:20.900 --> 08:22.435
What the fuck was all that?

08:22.535 --> 08:23.469
That was a lights-out finish.

08:23.569 --> 08:24.737
Literally.

08:24.837 --> 08:26.239
That was not
the finish we booked.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.773
Ace came to me last minute.

08:27.874 --> 08:29.308
You had time to rig a zipline!

08:29.408 --> 08:30.676
That's easy to do
if you're handy.

08:30.776 --> 08:32.712
I informed Rooster and The Hole

08:32.812 --> 08:34.514
that this might happen
before the match.

08:34.614 --> 08:35.848
I'll take that up
with them later,

08:35.948 --> 08:37.583
but it's not about informing.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.452
It's about you and I
booking this cross-promotion

08:39.552 --> 08:41.153
and agreeing on how
we're gonna do it,

08:41.254 --> 08:42.889
which I thought we had done,

08:42.989 --> 08:45.725
so I was stowed away up here,
like a gerbil in a pet shop,

08:45.825 --> 08:48.027
shitting on myself,
watching, waiting,

08:48.127 --> 08:49.996
assuming things were gonna go
according to the plan

08:50.096 --> 08:52.098
that you and I agreed to,
but no.

08:52.198 --> 08:53.499
Needle scratch. No.

08:53.599 --> 08:55.768
Y'all change shit up
with some fucking ghoul

08:55.868 --> 08:57.370
in a "Quadrophenia" coat.

08:57.470 --> 08:59.605
Fucking Adam Ant meets
the Hamburglar,

08:59.705 --> 09:02.241
who apparently stole
Burger King's crown.

09:02.341 --> 09:04.410
Hey, bud, I got a phone.

09:04.510 --> 09:06.212
You could have called, texted.

09:06.312 --> 09:08.147
You could have walked up
one flight of fucking stairs

09:08.247 --> 09:10.716
and whispered your big,
new, dumb idea in my ear.

09:10.816 --> 09:12.585
Nope! Surprise, Charlie.

09:12.685 --> 09:15.388
Fucking Ace hijacks
the entire night!

09:15.488 --> 09:17.590
- Not Ace. The Condemned.
-"Condamned."

09:17.690 --> 09:19.025
Nothing got hijacked.

09:19.125 --> 09:21.761
It was the cherry on top
of a DWL storyline.

09:21.861 --> 09:23.029
It's got nothing
to do with you.

09:23.129 --> 09:24.864
Hey, Billy Boy,
in this cross-promotion,

09:24.964 --> 09:26.933
there is no storyline that's
got nothing to do with me.

09:27.033 --> 09:28.701
Nobody told me that
I was gonna have to run

09:28.801 --> 09:29.835
every little detail by ya!

09:29.936 --> 09:31.604
Detail? It was the finish!

09:31.704 --> 09:33.606
Jack wrote Rooster
an amazing promo.

09:33.706 --> 09:35.441
Yeah, before the Condemned
dive-bombed him

09:35.541 --> 09:36.609
and launched some bullshit!

09:36.709 --> 09:38.477
It's "Condamned," Charlie boy.

09:38.578 --> 09:39.879
It's "fuck you," Bill!

09:39.979 --> 09:41.380
Shall we start the foreplay

09:41.480 --> 09:42.949
with me sitting on your face
again?

09:42.949 --> 09:44.383
Only if you'd like your nuts
chewed off this time.

09:44.483 --> 09:45.551
I'll hold him down
while you do it.

09:45.651 --> 09:46.819
Be my guest and try.

09:46.919 --> 09:48.554
I'm so glad
we're working together.

09:48.654 --> 09:49.722
Dystopia was supposed
to end the night

09:49.822 --> 09:51.223
up with the ring invasion.

09:51.324 --> 09:52.692
Instead, we end the night down,

09:52.792 --> 09:54.093
in front of 1,000 people.

09:54.193 --> 09:55.595
1,122.

09:55.695 --> 09:56.796
New Dome record, much of this

09:56.896 --> 09:58.631
due to Crystal's
new popularity.

09:58.731 --> 10:00.032
Charlie, fuck-yous

10:00.132 --> 10:01.934
and scrotum chewing aside,
Jack delivered.

10:02.034 --> 10:03.636
Speaking as a hall-of-famer,

10:03.736 --> 10:05.304
looked to me
like the cross-promotion

10:05.404 --> 10:06.672
was kicked off perfectly.

10:06.772 --> 10:08.541
Well, speaking
as one pissed-off motherfucker,

10:08.641 --> 10:10.776
it looked like my top guys
got beat up by a guy

10:10.876 --> 10:12.511
named after a non-word.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.747
Jack, two pieces of advice.

10:14.847 --> 10:17.750
One, get a new sound system
that doesn't sound

10:17.850 --> 10:19.752
like you bought it
at Radio Shack.

10:19.852 --> 10:21.821
Two, get a spelling book,

10:21.921 --> 10:23.522
'cause the word is "condemned!"

10:23.623 --> 10:26.525
Maybe I didn't consider this
with the level of granularity

10:26.626 --> 10:28.160
that you were expecting,
but I am not used

10:28.260 --> 10:30.129
to having to run everything
by a partner!

10:30.229 --> 10:31.464
Get used to it!

10:31.564 --> 10:33.499
Or the lawsuit is back on.

10:33.599 --> 10:34.600
Geezum Crow.

10:34.700 --> 10:36.135
You wanna play Fuck-Fuck?

10:36.235 --> 10:37.670
Spin the wheel!

10:37.770 --> 10:39.538
I, too, should have been
more granular,

10:39.639 --> 10:41.240
so let's get granular now.

10:41.340 --> 10:44.610
Ace's Blair Witch Project
is gonna get his ass kicked

10:44.710 --> 10:46.512
in my ring next week.

10:46.612 --> 10:48.047
End of discussion!

10:48.147 --> 10:50.249
It's a slow-burn character, Charlie.

10:50.349 --> 10:51.817
He's not gonna wanna do it!

10:51.917 --> 10:53.419
Well, that's
your problem to fix.

10:53.519 --> 10:54.720
Talk to your brother,

10:54.820 --> 10:56.956
and you better book
the Condamned

10:57.056 --> 10:58.791
in the fucking card next week

10:58.891 --> 11:02.662
and pray that I don't
zipline down and fuck him up

11:02.762 --> 11:04.263
in whatever whimsical way

11:04.363 --> 11:06.732
I feel like fucking improvising
at my fancy.

11:06.832 --> 11:08.668
I'm tryin' to fucking work
with you guys, man.

11:08.768 --> 11:09.969
I'm trying
to fucking work together.

11:10.069 --> 11:11.671
I'm trying to be
a fucking partner.

11:11.771 --> 11:13.406
You're not making it
fucking easy.

11:13.506 --> 11:14.974
Fuck you!

11:18.244 --> 11:18.978
Thanks.

11:19.078 --> 11:20.846
Now I gotta ride home with him.

11:30.723 --> 11:32.858
Intrigued about how
to play Fuck-Fuck.

11:32.958 --> 11:33.993
Apparently there's a wheel.

11:34.093 --> 11:36.028
Hamburglar was a deep cut.

11:36.128 --> 11:36.996
And Adam Ant.

11:37.096 --> 11:38.831
Must have watched a lot of MTV.

11:38.931 --> 11:41.367
I put us
in a real bad spot here.

11:43.235 --> 11:44.670
I begged Ace to come back
and told him

11:44.770 --> 11:46.038
we'd do the DWL together.

11:46.138 --> 11:47.807
Now we're making shit up
on the fly

11:47.907 --> 11:48.974
to appease Ace's psyche.

11:49.075 --> 11:51.577
I'm trying not to be my dad.

11:51.677 --> 11:54.013
I'm trying to take input
from you,

11:54.113 --> 11:56.716
and from you, and from Ace.

11:59.752 --> 12:01.854
Any of your notebooks
have something

12:01.954 --> 12:04.824
for a situation like this?

12:04.924 --> 12:08.060
A situation in which
a brand-new masked character,

12:08.160 --> 12:10.576
one who just revealed
his true identity

12:10.696 --> 12:12.498
by holding aloft
the charred crown

12:12.598 --> 12:14.266
of his dead father?

12:14.366 --> 12:16.702
Are you asking is there a page
in one of my notebooks

12:16.802 --> 12:18.637
that might provide us
with some direction

12:18.738 --> 12:20.773
as to how we will continue
this new storyline

12:20.873 --> 12:22.641
while in the midst
of a looming lawsuit

12:22.742 --> 12:24.977
that threatens
to crush the DWL?

12:26.278 --> 12:29.882
I can say with confidence that
nowhere in the many notebooks

12:29.982 --> 12:32.985
that I have pondered
countless, wide-ranging topics

12:33.085 --> 12:34.620
is there insight as to how
to make

12:34.720 --> 12:37.623
this particular situation work.

12:37.723 --> 12:40.826
But sounds like we must try quickly.

12:45.331 --> 12:47.500
You were amazing tonight.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.801
But then,

12:48.901 --> 12:50.503
you're always amazing.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.284
You had a good night too.

12:52.384 --> 12:54.707
Oh, limpin' around
playin' reporter.

12:54.807 --> 12:57.343
Gorilla Monsoon made
a career out of that.

12:57.443 --> 12:58.711
Hmm.

12:58.811 --> 13:00.246
Ace's new gimmick
hit it out of the park.

13:00.346 --> 13:02.828
Oh, oh, surprised the pants
off me,

13:02.948 --> 13:05.117
even though I could tell
it was Ace.

13:05.217 --> 13:07.386
Well, it's not like
you're not supposed to know.

13:07.486 --> 13:10.956
He pulled out his dad's crown.

13:10.956 --> 13:14.727
How much, uh, did you,
you know, help?

13:15.461 --> 13:18.898
I just did his hair
and his makeup.

13:18.998 --> 13:23.569
The other stuff
he's still figuring out.

13:23.669 --> 13:27.373
He really wants to, you know,
create his own thing.

13:30.075 --> 13:31.210
Uh, I'll be right back.

13:31.310 --> 13:32.278
Yeah.

13:33.345 --> 13:37.383
Hey, uh, Willie,
when is Jack having tryouts

13:37.483 --> 13:38.551
for the women's division?

13:38.651 --> 13:40.052
Your guess is as good as mine.

13:40.152 --> 13:41.887
You got candidates,
send me names.

13:41.987 --> 13:44.937
Well, I got no one
to wrestle next week.

13:45.057 --> 13:46.025
Well, that's all right.

13:46.125 --> 13:47.393
Take a week off. Cut a promo.

13:47.493 --> 13:50.196
What? Why? A-against who?

13:50.296 --> 13:51.230
Oh, boy.

13:51.330 --> 13:52.531
This tone again, really?
Wah-wah.

13:52.631 --> 13:53.599
Me-me.

13:53.699 --> 13:55.267
The complaints and entitlement.

13:55.367 --> 13:56.702
Look, right now,
Jack's got Gully up his ass--

13:56.802 --> 13:57.937
Okay. W-we can do it.

13:58.037 --> 13:59.138
Jack's not gonna care.

13:59.138 --> 14:00.906
You and I can hold the tryouts.

14:01.006 --> 14:02.241
I'll go online,
and I'll find some girls

14:02.341 --> 14:04.743
up in South Carolina
or something.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.545
I can't lose momentum.

14:06.645 --> 14:07.613
You won't lose momentum.

14:07.713 --> 14:09.248
Make your own momentum.

14:09.348 --> 14:11.016
And make sure you're using
a condom.

14:11.116 --> 14:13.285
That one's, you know,
a little bit dim.

14:13.385 --> 14:14.320
Dumb.

14:14.420 --> 14:15.621
D-don't say that.

14:15.721 --> 14:17.590
Bobby is a good guy

14:17.690 --> 14:19.491
who thinks before he speaks,

14:19.592 --> 14:21.126
who considers feelings,

14:21.227 --> 14:23.762
who knows that whatever he says
can either lift someone up

14:23.863 --> 14:25.531
or put them down,
so I-I'm not gonna stand

14:25.631 --> 14:26.599
for you putting him down to me.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.467
Okay. Lighten up.

14:28.567 --> 14:30.069
How about you don't tell me
that you being mean

14:30.169 --> 14:32.771
is something I need
to lighten up about?

14:32.771 --> 14:34.473
How about that?

14:39.712 --> 14:40.726
Your eyes are squinty.

14:40.846 --> 14:42.948
Is it bad news?

14:43.048 --> 14:44.850
Mm. No news.

14:44.950 --> 14:46.599
No plans.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.120
Just a week off.

14:48.220 --> 14:49.688
Hmm.

14:49.788 --> 14:51.624
You wanna do a push-up contest?

14:58.931 --> 15:01.367
Time to head home, Jack Spade.

15:01.467 --> 15:03.602
Crazy night.

15:03.702 --> 15:06.238
I need help.

15:06.338 --> 15:08.707
With putting the money
in the safe?

15:08.807 --> 15:11.243
What to do next.

15:11.343 --> 15:13.112
How to do it.

15:17.616 --> 15:19.718
Can you help me?

15:19.818 --> 15:22.688
I have no expertise
in wrestling.

15:22.788 --> 15:25.424
I don't even--I don't know.

15:25.524 --> 15:27.993
What's the opposite
of expertise?

15:28.093 --> 15:29.862
Beginner-pertise?

15:29.962 --> 15:32.831
I like having you
here working with me.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.633
Have you liked it?

15:43.008 --> 15:44.610
It's our family business.

15:44.710 --> 15:46.278
Mm-hmm.

15:46.378 --> 15:47.846
With the cross-promotion,
things are probably

15:47.947 --> 15:49.248
gonna get a little crazy here.

15:49.348 --> 15:50.849
Willie's underwater already.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.786
She's, uh... she's goggle-eyed.

15:53.886 --> 15:56.689
I worry that things
might be, you know,

15:56.789 --> 15:58.891
falling through the cracks.

15:58.991 --> 16:01.126
A woman from the County
came by the other day,

16:01.226 --> 16:03.128
looking to get
something from Willie,

16:03.228 --> 16:06.598
but Willie wasn't here.

16:06.699 --> 16:08.567
The woman seemed angry.

16:08.667 --> 16:10.202
She was here again tonight.

16:10.302 --> 16:13.872
I saw Willie give her
whatever she was looking for,

16:13.973 --> 16:15.074
so I hope it all worked out.

16:15.074 --> 16:16.408
That'd be Sonya Tuckerman.

16:16.508 --> 16:18.243
She does
the county tax assessment,

16:18.344 --> 16:19.979
so it's that time of year again
when she's gonna cost us,

16:20.079 --> 16:21.480
but she's fine.

16:21.580 --> 16:24.216
She j-just doesn't realize
how she comes across,

16:24.316 --> 16:25.985
which is dour and grumpy.

16:26.085 --> 16:27.019
Let me wash up.

16:27.119 --> 16:28.854
We'll get home.

16:44.937 --> 16:46.438
Rise and shine, sleepyhead!

16:46.438 --> 16:47.706
I been calling you.

16:47.806 --> 16:50.309
Texting you. Seven times.

16:50.409 --> 16:51.710
I had
to bail last night

16:51.810 --> 16:52.911
and take care of my pops.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.480
He all right?

16:54.580 --> 16:55.647
Yeah. That sums it up.

16:55.748 --> 16:56.882
He just a'ight.

16:56.982 --> 16:58.317
Let me know if I can help.

16:59.585 --> 17:02.388
May I shift subjects
and express my displeasure

17:02.488 --> 17:05.024
about last night's show
while acknowledging

17:05.124 --> 17:07.226
that this may lack perspective

17:07.326 --> 17:09.261
about your father's
current health?

17:09.361 --> 17:12.231
You knew about the Condamned
beforehand?

17:12.331 --> 17:13.799
Only moments beforehand.

17:13.899 --> 17:15.067
Yet you didn't call me?

17:15.167 --> 17:16.535
Because my phone
was in my damn locker!

17:16.635 --> 17:18.070
- I'm just asking!
- When I'm 'bout to go up,

17:18.170 --> 17:19.471
I'm working on what I gotta do.

17:19.471 --> 17:21.020
I ain't got my phone out,
looking at TikTok,

17:21.140 --> 17:22.474
texting, and calling people.

17:22.574 --> 17:25.377
It was locked up
in my locker so I could focus.

17:25.477 --> 17:27.946
Now, Jack wrote me
a great promo.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.848
Look, I'm playing ball.
He playing ball.

17:29.948 --> 17:31.583
He juggling you and Ace.
It's complicated!

17:31.683 --> 17:33.085
Well, it's gonna get
a lot more complicated

17:33.185 --> 17:35.020
if the Condamned
isn't in my ring

17:35.120 --> 17:37.389
Saturday night,
getting his ass kicked!

17:37.489 --> 17:39.158
Look, those Spade boys
don't know

17:39.158 --> 17:41.093
what that Condamned thing is,
and they damn sure

17:41.193 --> 17:43.095
ain't gonna figure it out
by Saturday.

17:43.195 --> 17:44.930
Look, the only reason
I agreed to this

17:45.030 --> 17:46.565
because I believe it's
good story.

17:46.665 --> 17:50.035
Thus, eventually money
in my pocket and yours.

17:50.135 --> 17:51.637
Now, come on, Charlie.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.138
Remove your emotions.

17:53.238 --> 17:55.007
Think creatively.

17:55.107 --> 17:57.776
Now, you remember how bad
you wanted Ace, right?

17:57.876 --> 17:59.311
- I do.
- Mm-hmm.

17:59.411 --> 18:02.815
Now, the Condamned gimmick
is already way better

18:02.915 --> 18:04.383
than any Ace gimmick.

18:04.483 --> 18:07.319
Now, let's say we string
this thing along.

18:07.319 --> 18:09.354
We build us back up,
and we make

18:09.455 --> 18:12.324
this cross-promotion thing work.

18:12.424 --> 18:15.260
Who's DWL's top guy,
to take on me?

18:15.360 --> 18:16.895
I mean, it's gotta be
somebody, right?

18:16.995 --> 18:18.330
- Yeah.
- I mean, they last champion

18:18.430 --> 18:20.866
was a girl
the size of Tinkerbell.

18:20.966 --> 18:23.302
And they former top guy,
Jack Spade,

18:23.402 --> 18:25.170
just lost clean
to that Tinkerbell.

18:25.270 --> 18:26.605
And the legendary Wild Bill

18:26.705 --> 18:29.308
is a pants-shitting
laughingstock

18:29.408 --> 18:31.777
who's one match away
from slipping into a warm bath,

18:31.877 --> 18:34.046
slitting his wrists, and
donating his brain to science.

18:34.146 --> 18:35.747
- Oh, my God.
- Now,

18:35.848 --> 18:37.683
the Condamned is mysterious.

18:37.783 --> 18:38.917
The Condamned is new.

18:39.017 --> 18:40.752
Now, if I beat a masked vigilante

18:40.853 --> 18:44.389
who seems like he can kick
100 guys' asses in the alley,

18:44.490 --> 18:45.991
who's the real cock
of the walk?

18:46.091 --> 18:47.259
Rooster time.

18:47.359 --> 18:49.094
- Dad?
- Hey, honey.

18:49.194 --> 18:50.362
You got a call from a guy

18:50.462 --> 18:51.864
named Brooks Rizzo,
in Hollywood.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.499
He works
for a social media app

18:53.599 --> 18:55.267
and streaming company
called Continuum.

18:55.367 --> 18:57.469
He wants to discuss
putting Dystopia on TV.

18:57.569 --> 18:58.871
- What?
- Well, not TV,

18:58.971 --> 19:00.272
but on their platform,

19:00.372 --> 19:02.141
which plays on TVs,
and tablets, and phones,

19:02.241 --> 19:03.542
like all the streaming
service companies.

19:03.642 --> 19:05.410
- Let's go!
- That's what I'm talking 'bout!

19:05.511 --> 19:07.012
- All right! All right!
- Come on! Come on!

19:07.112 --> 19:08.580
Guys, we-we about to be famous!

19:08.680 --> 19:09.748
Yeah we are!

19:09.848 --> 19:11.183
- You damn right!
- Okay!

19:22.594 --> 19:24.309
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi.

19:28.033 --> 19:29.434
You finally got some sleep.

19:29.535 --> 19:30.302
Mm.

19:30.402 --> 19:33.372
So, tell me what happened.

19:33.472 --> 19:36.808
She ended up being nice.

19:36.909 --> 19:38.277
What was her stage name?

19:38.377 --> 19:39.444
Wasn't really a stage name.

19:39.545 --> 19:41.580
It was more like a gimmick.

19:41.680 --> 19:42.781
Elle Dorado.

19:42.881 --> 19:43.982
Well, what's her real name?

19:44.082 --> 19:45.384
Tanya.

19:45.484 --> 19:47.386
That was popular
when I was a kid.

19:47.486 --> 19:49.788
They ever give you
kind of a fake name?

19:49.888 --> 19:51.156
I'm just me.

19:51.256 --> 19:52.791
Crystal.

19:52.891 --> 19:54.159
Rock solid.

19:54.259 --> 19:55.494
All natural.

19:57.129 --> 19:59.498
She said it's not easy.

19:59.598 --> 20:00.699
The road.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.635
She said to watch out
for peepholes.

20:04.636 --> 20:07.573
Well, if I wasn't in here,
I'd go on the road with you.

20:07.673 --> 20:09.608
No one would ever risk
peeping at you

20:09.708 --> 20:12.444
through peepholes
with me around.

20:12.544 --> 20:15.013
Goddamn, I hate not being there
to look out for you.

20:15.113 --> 20:17.416
I'm fine.

20:17.516 --> 20:19.117
- It's all fine.
- No, it ain't.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.686
You're out there, on your own.

20:20.786 --> 20:22.688
I should have been there
with you the whole time.

20:22.788 --> 20:27.059
Mom, it's fine.

20:27.159 --> 20:28.293
Don't worry.

20:28.393 --> 20:30.229
I am strong.

20:30.329 --> 20:31.563
Really.

20:33.498 --> 20:35.334
Just like you said.

20:36.735 --> 20:37.936
Rock solid.

20:44.109 --> 20:48.013
I just want you home.

20:48.113 --> 20:50.582
I know.

20:50.682 --> 20:51.617
I'm sorry.

20:51.717 --> 20:53.218
Don't be.

20:53.318 --> 20:54.786
You don't need to say it.

20:58.423 --> 20:59.591
I met a guy.

20:59.691 --> 21:02.160
Oh, do tell.

21:02.160 --> 21:03.795
Only if it's a nice guy.

21:16.575 --> 21:18.610
Good to see you.
Thank you.

21:20.345 --> 21:21.613
Just saw Mr. Devaux.

21:21.613 --> 21:23.482
He was at the show last night.
Loved it.

21:23.582 --> 21:24.883
Fred Devaux loved the show?

21:24.983 --> 21:26.084
Yeah.

21:26.184 --> 21:27.786
- High school principal.
- Aw.

21:27.886 --> 21:29.488
It's weird having
people actually like you.

21:29.588 --> 21:30.889
One of these days,
you're gonna have to let me

21:30.989 --> 21:32.291
- know what that feels like.
- I'm trying to.

21:32.391 --> 21:33.558
Hey, after you
left last night--

21:33.558 --> 21:35.127
Oh, one sec.
Tricia Bell texted me

21:35.227 --> 21:36.094
and said
that she wants to be, like,

21:36.194 --> 21:37.896
my goth/emo valet.

21:37.996 --> 21:39.564
Catwoman kinda thing.

21:39.665 --> 21:41.466
Last time didn't terrorize her?

21:41.566 --> 21:43.302
Says she's intrigued.

21:43.402 --> 21:44.670
You're blowing up.

21:44.770 --> 21:47.239
Yeah, but it's more
than that, you know?

21:47.339 --> 21:49.574
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Hey, look.

21:49.574 --> 21:51.109
After you left last night,

21:51.209 --> 21:53.278
I had a chat
with Charlie Gully,

21:53.378 --> 21:56.648
and he offered to host
the Condamned at Dystopia.

21:56.748 --> 21:58.517
Host? Host what?

21:58.617 --> 21:59.918
He wants to feature
the Condamned

22:00.018 --> 22:01.386
at Dystopia this week.

22:01.486 --> 22:05.457
Of course he does,
'cause it's dope.

22:05.457 --> 22:07.592
- Obviously, the answer's no.
- Okay.

22:07.592 --> 22:09.194
No way we're wasting
the Condamned at his shitshow.

22:09.294 --> 22:10.862
- He can host this.
- Hey, hey.

22:10.962 --> 22:11.897
Come on, dude.

22:11.997 --> 22:13.999
Look, when we're at church,

22:13.999 --> 22:16.535
you do not need to grab
your unit to make a point.

22:16.635 --> 22:18.770
All right?
S-sorry. Sorry. Sorry, Staci.

22:18.770 --> 22:20.339
I'm sorry, Jesus.

22:20.339 --> 22:23.075
I understand the impulse,
relative to the situation.

22:23.175 --> 22:24.743
Best sister-in-law ever.

22:24.843 --> 22:26.992
I don't think Gully understands
what this all means to you.

22:27.092 --> 22:28.246
No way he could.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.615
That being said, I did tell him

22:30.716 --> 22:32.417
that I would run it by you.

22:32.517 --> 22:34.252
Okay, well, tell him you did,
and tell him I told you

22:34.353 --> 22:35.721
there's no way we're wasting
the Condamned

22:35.821 --> 22:37.856
on an audience that wouldn't
understand the...

22:37.956 --> 22:39.691
nu-the nuance.
Is "nuance" a word?

22:39.791 --> 22:40.726
Mm-hmm.

22:40.826 --> 22:42.094
The-the-the-the
complexity

22:42.194 --> 22:43.595
of what we got goin' on here.

22:43.695 --> 22:45.297
There's a chance
for this gimmick to really,

22:45.397 --> 22:47.366
really speak to people
about, uh, impulse,

22:47.466 --> 22:49.401
and-and appetite, and the-
the cost of those things.

22:49.501 --> 22:50.502
You know, redemption.

22:50.602 --> 22:52.003
Deliverance from evil.

22:52.104 --> 22:53.605
Like in the Lord's Prayer.
"Deliver us from evil."

22:53.705 --> 22:55.307
It's all right there
waiting to be tapped

22:55.407 --> 22:56.975
and told for new audiences.

22:57.075 --> 22:59.144
Mm-hmm.

22:59.244 --> 23:00.178
You understand,
don't you, Staci?

23:00.278 --> 23:01.380
You can see it.

23:01.480 --> 23:02.814
I do understand.

23:02.914 --> 23:04.683
And you can see it?

23:04.783 --> 23:06.698
I can.

23:06.818 --> 23:07.953
Come here.

23:08.053 --> 23:09.454
Aw.

23:09.554 --> 23:10.655
God bless you.

23:10.756 --> 23:12.057
Aw, I love you too.

23:16.094 --> 23:17.662
Hey.

23:20.832 --> 23:21.933
You all right?

23:22.033 --> 23:23.802
I'm great.

23:23.902 --> 23:26.037
You don't seem great.

23:26.138 --> 23:27.105
Yeah, well...

23:27.205 --> 23:29.007
Let's just do this.

23:29.107 --> 23:30.409
Yes, let's.

23:30.509 --> 23:32.077
Should we discuss
the Condamned?

23:32.177 --> 23:33.178
You tell me.

23:34.312 --> 23:35.280
Let's discuss it.

23:35.380 --> 23:36.648
It was big news.

23:36.748 --> 23:39.017
Cool.

23:39.117 --> 23:42.287
Hey, hey.

23:42.387 --> 23:45.056
What is up with the pout-pout?

23:45.157 --> 23:47.125
I'm trying to help you,

23:47.225 --> 23:48.593
open doors for you.

23:48.693 --> 23:50.362
Expose you to stuff.
Lift you up.

23:50.462 --> 23:51.663
Make your dreams come true.

23:51.763 --> 23:53.131
And you're pouty-pout
man-pouting

23:53.231 --> 23:54.232
about I don't fucking know what.

23:54.332 --> 23:55.934
You treat me like a scrub.

23:58.603 --> 24:01.072
You treat me like a gofer.

24:01.173 --> 24:02.974
You aren't lifting me up.

24:03.074 --> 24:05.410
You're using me to buck up
your fragile ego.

24:05.510 --> 24:06.711
My ego isn't fragile.

24:06.812 --> 24:08.980
Everyone's ego is fragile,

24:09.080 --> 24:11.149
but good people
don't treat other people badly

24:11.249 --> 24:12.217
to build theirs up.

24:15.187 --> 24:16.521
And...

24:17.289 --> 24:18.824
Three, two, one.

24:26.932 --> 24:27.999
Welcome.

24:31.203 --> 24:32.771
Quick bit of business.

24:32.871 --> 24:35.273
I know y'all love listening
to the Wild Bill Podcast,

24:35.373 --> 24:37.876
but going forward,

24:37.976 --> 24:40.078
we got a new name in the title.

24:40.178 --> 24:44.583
Going forward, this is
not the Wild Bill Podcast.

24:44.683 --> 24:46.485
This is the Wild Bill

24:46.585 --> 24:50.889
and Diego Cottonmouth Podcast.

24:52.057 --> 24:53.758
Been a great partnership
so far

24:53.859 --> 24:56.661
and one I hope will continue.

25:00.899 --> 25:02.934
It's an honor
to be with you, Bill.

25:09.040 --> 25:10.842
All right, let's get into it,
shall we?

25:10.942 --> 25:11.910
First up...

25:22.854 --> 25:25.490
Caitlyn, please get Brooks.

25:25.590 --> 25:26.825
He's coming.

25:26.925 --> 25:28.573
And please tell

25:28.693 --> 25:30.262
whoever redecorated my office
over the weekend,

25:30.362 --> 25:32.731
who clearly thought
they were doing me a favor,

25:32.831 --> 25:34.633
that when they redecorate,
they shouldn't insult

25:34.733 --> 25:36.201
people's intelligence
with fake books

25:36.301 --> 25:39.771
with... colorful spines
that I would like to burn.

25:39.871 --> 25:43.608
Brooks, I am meeting
with the board in two weeks.

25:43.708 --> 25:45.510
Please brighten my day
with some good news.

25:45.610 --> 25:47.846
Darren Phillips
scouted women's golf,

25:47.946 --> 25:50.081
said there might be
some possibilities there.

25:50.181 --> 25:53.265
Taylor said that we can get
Kentucky Derby coverage cheap.

25:53.385 --> 25:54.953
Imagine our surge
in subscribers

25:55.053 --> 25:56.755
when people find out there's
a new platform

25:56.855 --> 25:58.323
where you can watch horses
running around

25:58.423 --> 26:00.625
while getting whipped,
surrounded by women in hats.

26:00.725 --> 26:02.060
We're very much
all over the place.

26:02.160 --> 26:03.328
We need not to be.

26:03.428 --> 26:04.930
I'm going to Florida
to scope out

26:05.030 --> 26:06.865
some independent professional
wrestling promotions.

26:06.965 --> 26:09.801
I hate professional wrestling
even more than I hate horses.

26:09.901 --> 26:11.503
You don't hate horses.

26:11.603 --> 26:13.171
I hate when they're racing
and getting whipped.

26:13.271 --> 26:15.373
You know, horses aren't
naturally competitive.

26:15.473 --> 26:17.042
It's humans who
make them that way.

26:17.142 --> 26:19.644
Perhaps I hate horses more
because of the people

26:19.744 --> 26:21.546
who own them, who make them
something they're not.

26:21.646 --> 26:24.182
Last year, total revenue
for professional wrestling

26:24.282 --> 26:27.385
was 1.095 billion.

26:27.485 --> 26:29.688
I guess I could grow to love
professional wrestling.

26:29.788 --> 26:32.591
Although, I hate when men
wear those bikini pants.

26:32.691 --> 26:36.628
Either wear shorts or nothing,
not in between.

26:36.728 --> 26:39.197
So we buy
a wrestling promotion.

26:39.297 --> 26:41.399
More than one. Grab a handful.

26:41.499 --> 26:43.001
Promote the hell out of 'em.

26:43.101 --> 26:46.071
Build it, brand it, live shows
and streamed content.

26:46.171 --> 26:47.439
Expand. Who knows?

26:47.539 --> 26:49.774
Maybe, in one to three years,
it grows.

26:49.874 --> 26:53.612
Optimism is mental illness,
but it's cute.

26:53.712 --> 26:55.580
Have fun. Don't drink.

26:55.680 --> 26:57.649
Hmm.

27:01.753 --> 27:03.221
You look
handy up there.

27:03.321 --> 27:04.956
Just got to thinking
how, every summer,

27:05.056 --> 27:06.791
we lose who knows
how many thousands of dollars'

27:06.891 --> 27:09.060
worth of air conditioning
out these windows.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.663
Hey, would you hand me
that towel there?

27:11.763 --> 27:13.531
I should get you
to come to my place.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.367
I'm happy to help
wherever I can.

27:15.467 --> 27:18.470
Jack was thinking,
with the cross-promotion chaos,

27:18.570 --> 27:19.818
things might get
a little busy around here,

27:19.938 --> 27:21.640
so I figured
I might as well help out.

27:21.740 --> 27:23.355
- All for one and all, you know.
- Yeah, well,

27:23.475 --> 27:24.809
the list of things
we need help with

27:24.909 --> 27:26.291
is never-ending.
You don't wanna know.

27:26.411 --> 27:27.345
I do.

27:27.445 --> 27:28.480
Sump pump's busted.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.115
- Maybe I don't.
- Exactly.

27:30.215 --> 27:31.182
Oh, hey, Willie,

27:31.282 --> 27:33.551
before you go, uh,

27:33.652 --> 27:35.286
you connected
with Sonya Tuckerman,

27:35.387 --> 27:36.354
the woman from the County?

27:36.354 --> 27:37.555
I did. Thanks.

27:37.656 --> 27:38.590
Okay.

27:39.290 --> 27:43.294
Yeah, so she got
what she came for then?

27:43.294 --> 27:45.397
Saturday night, in the hallway?

27:45.497 --> 27:47.632
Yeah. She got it.

27:47.732 --> 27:49.434
Jack says
she's the tax assessor.

27:49.534 --> 27:51.202
She is.

27:51.302 --> 27:53.071
I paid a bill.

27:53.171 --> 27:54.806
For some bills,
we write checks,

27:54.906 --> 27:56.307
and some we pay in cash.

27:56.307 --> 27:59.611
You pay the property taxes
in cash, in an envelope?

27:59.711 --> 28:01.146
We do.

28:01.246 --> 28:02.580
We pay the property taxes
in cash, in an envelope,

28:02.681 --> 28:04.015
and Sonya Tuckerman handles it.

28:04.115 --> 28:05.684
And if Sonya Tuckerman
didn't handle it,

28:05.784 --> 28:07.185
we'd be screwed.

28:08.820 --> 28:11.222
That's enough of an answer.

28:11.322 --> 28:12.657
No, it isn't.

28:12.657 --> 28:13.992
Staci...

28:15.927 --> 28:17.529
this isn't anything
you need to worry about.

28:17.629 --> 28:18.430
It looks like it might be.

28:18.530 --> 28:19.864
It isn't.

28:22.133 --> 28:23.615
Okay, look, there's-there's
two kinds of women.

28:23.735 --> 28:25.336
There are women
who get taken care of.

28:25.336 --> 28:27.038
You know, they emit
some kind of soft vapor.

28:27.138 --> 28:28.753
People gather around
and take care of 'em.

28:28.853 --> 28:30.608
That's you.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.143
And then there's me.

28:32.243 --> 28:34.746
I emit some kind
of coal engine smoke.

28:34.846 --> 28:37.048
I get dirty, and I fix shit,

28:37.148 --> 28:38.983
and I stay up all night
worrying about

28:39.084 --> 28:40.785
more dirty shit I gotta fix.

28:40.885 --> 28:42.567
I fix shit, so you don't have
to spend a single second

28:42.687 --> 28:44.322
worrying about un-fixed shit.

28:44.422 --> 28:45.757
What's going on here, Willie?

28:45.857 --> 28:46.758
You wanna know what's going on?

28:46.858 --> 28:48.193
Here's what's going on.

28:48.293 --> 28:50.028
Tom and I made
an agreement, years ago,

28:50.128 --> 28:51.496
that we would do
whatever we needed to do

28:51.496 --> 28:53.164
to keep this place alive.

28:53.264 --> 28:55.233
And you don't need to worry
about what those things are.

28:55.333 --> 28:56.267
Are they legal?

28:56.367 --> 28:57.502
Some are.

28:57.602 --> 28:58.937
Well, whatever
those other ones are,

28:59.037 --> 29:01.306
we're not doing 'em anymore.

29:01.406 --> 29:04.142
The DWL is
a house of cards built on sand,

29:04.242 --> 29:06.411
in the middle of a hurricane,
on a leaky boat.

29:06.511 --> 29:08.646
We do whatever we need to do.

29:08.747 --> 29:11.182
Does Jack know?

29:11.282 --> 29:13.651
No.

29:13.752 --> 29:15.887
What else are we doing?

29:15.987 --> 29:17.622
I wanna know everything.

29:17.722 --> 29:19.257
I'm not gonna tell you everything.

29:19.357 --> 29:21.092
You're saying that to pretend
like you're protecting me

29:21.192 --> 29:22.927
when, in fact, you're
only protecting yourself.

29:23.027 --> 29:24.863
This turning into
that kind of conversation?

29:24.863 --> 29:26.931
Everything that's going on,
Jack needs to know.

29:27.031 --> 29:29.534
I need to know,
so we can make it right...

29:29.634 --> 29:30.702
...move on.

29:30.802 --> 29:32.403
"Make it right."

29:32.504 --> 29:36.241
Well, those are some big,
shiny morals you've got there,

29:36.341 --> 29:39.344
but here's the problem
with knowing stuff.

29:39.444 --> 29:43.615
You can't un-know it,
so what if knowing stuff

29:43.715 --> 29:45.049
means finding out the DWL

29:45.150 --> 29:46.651
can't keep itself afloat legally

29:46.751 --> 29:48.586
and never has?

29:48.686 --> 29:51.022
What if it means finding out
that Tom had years and years

29:51.022 --> 29:53.324
of promissory notes
and third mortgages

29:53.424 --> 29:55.426
and lines of credit
and business loans he knew

29:55.527 --> 29:57.162
he'd never be able to pay off?

29:57.262 --> 29:58.730
Hmm?

29:58.830 --> 30:00.632
Is that really something
you wanna know?

30:00.732 --> 30:02.467
And how you gonna fix it?

30:02.567 --> 30:05.770
How you gonna fix over $100,000
in county property taxes

30:05.870 --> 30:07.305
that we avoided paying
because Sonya Tuckerman

30:07.405 --> 30:09.407
had a crush on Tom?

30:09.507 --> 30:10.942
What are you gonna do?

30:11.042 --> 30:13.324
You gonna tell Jack
his father wasn't only

30:13.444 --> 30:16.581
the bastard that left him,
but also a hustler

30:16.681 --> 30:17.816
who didn't always
tell the truth

30:17.916 --> 30:19.684
to get people to give him
money?

30:19.784 --> 30:21.820
Tom didn't want Jack
knowing anything

30:21.920 --> 30:23.922
'cause he didn't want
wrestling ruining his life,

30:24.022 --> 30:26.324
and as for the DWL,

30:26.424 --> 30:28.359
he probably forgot
he even willed it to him.

30:28.459 --> 30:30.962
That will hadn't been touched
since Jack was six years old.

30:32.730 --> 30:34.766
Back when Tom thought,
as did I,

30:34.866 --> 30:36.534
that this thing
was gonna be something

30:36.634 --> 30:38.503
worth leaving someone.

30:38.603 --> 30:40.972
Stupid.

30:41.072 --> 30:45.109
Tom didn't do Jack any favors
leaving him the DWL.

30:45.210 --> 30:47.011
He left him a rat's nest
to untangle,

30:47.111 --> 30:49.814
and he left me with it.

30:49.914 --> 30:51.950
I'm just stupid enough
to still be standing here,

30:52.050 --> 30:53.618
trying to fix it.

30:56.120 --> 30:58.356
You say you need
to make it right.

30:58.456 --> 31:00.158
Make it right, Staci.

31:00.258 --> 31:01.726
Take it all.

31:01.826 --> 31:03.595
Tell Jack all about it.

31:03.695 --> 31:06.664
Jack's an honest man.

31:06.764 --> 31:09.701
We're all honest,
till we're not.

31:19.210 --> 31:22.280
The Condamned is wrestling
at Dystopia this week.

31:22.380 --> 31:23.715
No exceptions.

31:23.815 --> 31:26.184
I'm not gonna blow
the Condamned's whole character

31:26.284 --> 31:27.952
in some ordinary match
with you.

31:28.052 --> 31:30.121
First, the character's
been around what, three days?

31:30.221 --> 31:32.757
Second, a match
with me is never ordinary.

31:32.857 --> 31:34.993
I'm the FWD champ.

31:35.093 --> 31:36.728
So by not wrestling me,
you get to keep

31:36.828 --> 31:38.062
that belt a little longer.

31:38.162 --> 31:39.163
Ace doesn't wanna wrestle
at Dystopia,

31:39.264 --> 31:40.598
so it's not gonna happen.

31:40.698 --> 31:42.767
You agreed
to this cross-promotion.

31:42.867 --> 31:44.402
There's only one choice.

31:44.502 --> 31:47.071
Well, there's two, if you count
gettin' sued and going bankrupt.

31:47.171 --> 31:49.407
I'd say Charlie doesn't care
which, but he does.

31:49.507 --> 31:51.542
His character really means
a lot to him.

31:51.643 --> 31:54.479
Next, you gonna tell me
that he's not such a bad guy.

31:54.579 --> 31:57.982
You keep telling that
to yourself until it sink in.

31:58.082 --> 31:59.751
He's the one you got
to deal with,

31:59.851 --> 32:01.766
because you punched him.

32:01.886 --> 32:04.102
So you just focus
on what's next.

32:04.222 --> 32:07.725
Right now, you just do
what you gotta do

32:07.825 --> 32:10.561
so your bill
don't get past due.

32:10.662 --> 32:11.996
Ciao.

32:16.801 --> 32:18.670
Tell me I'm being
short-sighted.

32:18.770 --> 32:20.305
You're not being short-sighted.

32:20.305 --> 32:22.507
You're trying to pretend you
got a choice when you don't.

32:22.607 --> 32:24.676
We can make it a shoot.

32:24.776 --> 32:26.511
Go down there, and pin him
when he's not expecting it.

32:26.611 --> 32:28.112
Ace, you can hold
him down for an hour,

32:28.212 --> 32:30.248
and the ref will
never count to three.

32:30.348 --> 32:33.051
Besides, you said you don't
wanna go back to Dystopia,

32:33.151 --> 32:34.052
and I don't blame you.

32:34.152 --> 32:35.586
I definitely don't.

32:35.687 --> 32:36.988
It's not like I wanna go.

32:37.088 --> 32:38.957
I'm just saying, as your
brother, if you told me,

32:39.057 --> 32:40.358
"I need you to do it..."

32:40.458 --> 32:41.492
No.

32:42.560 --> 32:44.429
If you really
don't got a choice--

32:44.529 --> 32:45.596
It's my fuck-up.

32:45.697 --> 32:46.931
It's not yours.

32:47.031 --> 32:48.099
You punched him
'cause you were trying

32:48.199 --> 32:50.068
to save me from him.

32:50.168 --> 32:52.136
That was the wrong way
to handle it.

32:52.236 --> 32:54.505
This is your character.

32:54.605 --> 32:58.042
Don't go messing with it
just to cover my mistake.

32:58.142 --> 33:00.979
Fuck Gully.

33:01.079 --> 33:02.447
I'd rather go down in flames.

33:02.547 --> 33:04.415
I don't want you
to go down in flames.

33:04.515 --> 33:06.384
I don't want us
to go down in flames.

33:06.484 --> 33:08.386
Besides, flames are
the sort of situation

33:08.486 --> 33:10.655
the Condamned's trying
to steer away from anyway.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.627
We really are fucked.

33:18.096 --> 33:19.430
Nah, not really.

33:19.530 --> 33:20.732
It's just wrestling.

33:24.469 --> 33:25.970
Give him Crystal.

33:26.070 --> 33:27.438
Gully wants me, not Crystal.

33:27.538 --> 33:28.873
Gully wants you to wrestle,
so don't wrestle.

33:28.973 --> 33:30.208
Appear.

33:30.308 --> 33:31.476
Ten seconds.
You're in. You're out.

33:31.576 --> 33:32.310
Boom. It's over.

33:32.410 --> 33:33.911
Gully'd wanna win the night.

33:34.012 --> 33:34.645
Then Gully wins
the night.

33:34.746 --> 33:35.813
So what?

33:35.913 --> 33:37.682
Move on.
Cut your losses, right?

33:37.782 --> 33:40.151
Let's stop acting like we got
a choice in the matter.

33:40.251 --> 33:41.452
Just do it. Go.

33:41.552 --> 33:43.888
We can't throw
Crystal to the wolves.

33:43.988 --> 33:45.189
Not at this point.

33:45.289 --> 33:46.858
Crystal just
survived y'all's asses.

33:46.958 --> 33:49.407
Y'all are wolves, bears,
lions, and hyenas.

33:49.507 --> 33:51.496
And jackasses.
Crystal can handle Dystopia.

33:51.596 --> 33:53.631
She can handle
whatever comes at her next.

33:53.731 --> 33:54.999
Stop talking.

33:54.999 --> 33:56.167
Let's fix this shit.

34:05.943 --> 34:08.393
Those are something.
The bracelets.

34:11.082 --> 34:12.517
Elle left them for me.

34:12.617 --> 34:14.619
Bargain-basement
Wonder Woman she was.

34:16.120 --> 34:17.588
She was nice.

34:17.688 --> 34:19.424
Come sit.

34:22.627 --> 34:26.030
Crystal, Jack is
sending Ace to Dystopia.

34:26.130 --> 34:27.365
Not sending.

34:27.465 --> 34:29.300
It's voluntary. He wants to go.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.035
Now Gully's being a dick.

34:31.135 --> 34:33.271
Sun's gonna rise tomorrow too.
Big surprise.

34:33.371 --> 34:35.640
Anyhow, Ace is gonna do it.

34:35.740 --> 34:36.774
One night.

34:39.077 --> 34:41.312
And I think you should go too.

34:41.412 --> 34:44.015
Lemons outta lemonade,
or other way around,

34:44.115 --> 34:47.885
but the thing is,

34:47.985 --> 34:51.389
you were right
about the women's league.

34:51.489 --> 34:53.357
It's time we shit
or get off the pot.

34:53.458 --> 34:56.394
We'll make Gully put you in
a match with one of his girls.

34:56.494 --> 34:57.428
Women.

34:57.528 --> 34:59.030
You know,
someone from his roster.

34:59.130 --> 35:00.698
He's got a lot of 'em,
women down there.

35:00.798 --> 35:02.667
Could be a big boost,

35:02.767 --> 35:05.069
one you couldn't get here,

35:05.169 --> 35:10.241
not without more women
on our roster, so go.

35:11.809 --> 35:14.545
Don't just stand there,
staring at an open door.

35:14.645 --> 35:15.760
Don't question it.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.849
This is a chance.

35:17.949 --> 35:22.253
You take it, and it'll lead
to another and another.

35:22.353 --> 35:23.835
You get in that ring
at Dystopia,

35:23.955 --> 35:25.356
and you say,
"Shove it up your ass.

35:25.456 --> 35:26.858
I am here to sparkle."

35:29.360 --> 35:31.829
And I'll be there
to protect you.

35:37.902 --> 35:40.471
Okay.

35:40.571 --> 35:41.772
I'll do it.

35:45.276 --> 35:46.791
Willie says Gully
has me wrestling

35:46.911 --> 35:48.446
some woman named Venus Cancer.

35:48.546 --> 35:50.328
- Mm-hmm.
- Willie talked to her.

35:50.428 --> 35:51.749
- Says she's cool.
- See?

35:51.849 --> 35:53.050
You were all worried
you were gonna have

35:53.050 --> 35:54.719
a week off and lose momentum,

35:54.819 --> 35:57.135
and now you're a featured act
at Dystopia.

35:57.255 --> 35:58.890
That's five times our crowd.

35:58.990 --> 36:00.725
Trust your destiny.

36:00.825 --> 36:02.093
Faith.

36:02.193 --> 36:03.541
It's not a lot of prep time.

36:03.661 --> 36:05.630
Your entire life,
up to this moment,

36:05.730 --> 36:06.831
has been prep time.

36:06.931 --> 36:08.900
God placed you in this moment,

36:09.000 --> 36:10.635
not to test you,

36:10.735 --> 36:12.436
to reward you,

36:12.537 --> 36:14.705
to shine a spotlight on you.

36:14.805 --> 36:16.240
I know this.

36:16.240 --> 36:19.911
I do not know a lot,
but I know this.

36:22.547 --> 36:26.317
At what point does,
like, your face fall off,

36:26.417 --> 36:27.919
revealing yourself to be
some kind

36:28.019 --> 36:30.588
of romance novel android man

36:30.688 --> 36:33.704
engineered to make me feel good
about myself

36:33.824 --> 36:35.806
when I'm at my lowest
and most uncertain?

36:35.927 --> 36:37.128
Hmm.

36:37.228 --> 36:38.963
I cannot compute
what you say, Crystal.

36:38.963 --> 36:40.264
Go win!

36:40.364 --> 36:42.366
Bobby 2000 at your service.

36:42.466 --> 36:44.669
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

36:46.571 --> 36:47.919
Don't worry about calling.

36:48.039 --> 36:49.754
Stay focused.

36:49.874 --> 36:52.210
Oh, Jack says
it's time to roll.

36:52.310 --> 36:53.411
Bobby, wish us luck.

36:53.511 --> 36:55.112
Oh, you don't need it.

36:55.213 --> 36:57.181
We'll be watching
on the Dystopia livestream.

36:57.281 --> 36:58.549
- Crush it, Crystal.
- Mm.

36:58.649 --> 37:00.818
And you give 'em hell, Condamned.

37:12.330 --> 37:14.999
I really like you.

37:15.099 --> 37:16.834
You know what I mean?

37:18.302 --> 37:19.870
I really like you too.

38:21.899 --> 38:22.700
I need you to kick out.

38:22.800 --> 38:23.868
Kick out!

38:23.968 --> 38:25.403
There it is. Good job.

38:25.503 --> 38:27.405
Yo, Rooster, heads up.

38:27.505 --> 38:29.540
And, well, looky here.

38:32.977 --> 38:34.245
Hello, old friends.

38:34.345 --> 38:36.614
Now, folks, let's give
a warm Dystopia welcome

38:36.714 --> 38:39.917
to our partners from the DWL.

38:48.359 --> 38:50.127
So I have some thoughts
on how this should go.

38:50.227 --> 38:51.262
Well, your thoughts
better involve

38:51.362 --> 38:52.797
you getting your asses kicked.

38:52.897 --> 38:54.098
Rooster, I need
your help persuading Gully

38:54.198 --> 38:56.100
that what I've booked is great.

38:56.200 --> 38:57.868
Look, Jack, I'm not here to
help you with your business,

38:57.968 --> 39:00.638
yo bitchin', your complainin',
or persuadin'.

39:00.738 --> 39:02.673
Look, good shit sells itself.

39:02.773 --> 39:06.444
Sell some good shit without
Condemnation Man winning,

39:06.544 --> 39:08.346
and Gully will bite.

39:10.214 --> 39:13.017
Why, in the name
of whatever almighty God

39:13.117 --> 39:16.187
created this dog-eat-dog world
should I let you

39:16.287 --> 39:17.988
book what happens in my ring

39:18.089 --> 39:20.291
and trust that you're actually
gonna go through with it?

39:20.391 --> 39:22.660
Well, first off, you get
to punch me in the face.

39:22.760 --> 39:24.395
- Yay, Dad.
- Yeah, yay me.

39:24.495 --> 39:25.496
Okay, keep going.

39:25.596 --> 39:27.031
It gets better.

39:31.035 --> 39:32.303
Brooks Rizzo just texted.

39:32.403 --> 39:33.771
He's gonna be
a little bit late.

39:33.871 --> 39:35.272
We're not gonna start
the show without him,

39:35.272 --> 39:36.354
so meet him out there
for will-call.

39:36.474 --> 39:37.675
Sit next to him
during the show.

39:37.775 --> 39:38.776
If he needs anything,
get it to him.

39:38.876 --> 39:40.010
- Dad?
- Yes?

39:40.111 --> 39:41.479
- I got this.
- Okay. Thank you.

40:01.298 --> 40:03.981
Ooh!

40:05.836 --> 40:07.104
Yeah!

40:10.941 --> 40:12.643
Get her on the corner, Venus.

40:16.947 --> 40:18.149
Aha!

40:22.019 --> 40:23.954
You okay, Crystal?

40:43.274 --> 40:44.341
You okay, Venus?

40:44.341 --> 40:45.910
Venus?

41:04.995 --> 41:06.163
Okay.

41:09.166 --> 41:10.848
Holy shit.

41:11.836 --> 41:14.205
One, two--

41:17.074 --> 41:18.209
All right. She's great.

41:18.309 --> 41:19.844
Let's see how she is
on the mic.

41:19.944 --> 41:21.579
I am not gonna be thrown off
by your words, Jack.

41:21.679 --> 41:23.013
I learned all of them.

41:23.113 --> 41:25.049
I was in the senior class
play, Godspell.

41:25.049 --> 41:26.517
Okay. Pipe down, Pippin.

41:31.669 --> 41:35.092
I didn't do Pippin.

41:35.192 --> 41:38.028
Pippin was not as good
of a musical.

41:52.443 --> 41:53.711
Crystal, you wanna give--

41:53.811 --> 41:54.812
Crystal, you wanna give up?

41:54.812 --> 41:56.013
No.

41:56.113 --> 41:57.461
Whoo!

42:01.565 --> 42:03.754
No, she's doin' it!
She's doin' it!

42:03.754 --> 42:05.256
Go!

42:16.734 --> 42:19.803
One, two--two.

42:19.904 --> 42:21.138
Two.

42:21.238 --> 42:23.954
Hey! Hey!

42:24.074 --> 42:27.077
Hey, where are you going?
Get back in here!

42:27.177 --> 42:28.612
No más! Ah!

42:30.915 --> 42:32.683
Don't look at me.
I'm still here.

42:32.783 --> 42:34.618
Y'all came to see
wrestling, right?

43:26.670 --> 43:30.708
Crystal Tyler!

43:30.808 --> 43:32.409
That's a great name.

43:32.509 --> 43:34.511
You got a lot of guts
coming down here,

43:34.612 --> 43:37.781
taking on my number one lady,
Venus Cancer.

43:37.881 --> 43:39.650
Hey, Kevin, give her a mic.

43:39.750 --> 43:41.752
Crystal, you and I
need to talk.

43:41.852 --> 43:43.954
Talk about what?
How your wrestler is a coward?

43:44.054 --> 43:45.656
- Ooh!
- Venus is not a coward.

43:45.756 --> 43:47.591
She was just following orders.

43:47.691 --> 43:52.296
My orders, because this
is my ring, and I am God!

43:58.469 --> 43:59.637
I wanted to see

43:59.737 --> 44:01.238
the Crystal Tyler show
in person.

44:01.338 --> 44:05.075
You have come a long way
in a very short time.

44:05.175 --> 44:09.146
From valet, to DWL champ,
to women's champ,

44:09.246 --> 44:13.617
to pound-for-pound
the toughest S-O-B in the DWL.

44:13.717 --> 44:14.585
It's true!

44:14.685 --> 44:17.635
Yeah!

44:17.755 --> 44:19.490
But tonight,
I have been reminded

44:19.590 --> 44:22.126
of a very important
botanical truth.

44:22.226 --> 44:25.262
Even in a shit pile
like the DWL,

44:25.362 --> 44:28.332
a lovely rose can still bloom.

44:31.235 --> 44:34.938
Okay, so to me, the real sin
is to leave that rose

44:35.039 --> 44:37.841
growing in a shit pile.

44:37.941 --> 44:41.011
Oh, Hole-i-o, please
bring me my briefcase.

44:44.882 --> 44:46.150
Listen up, Crystal.

44:46.250 --> 44:49.753
I wanna be
in the Crystal Tyler business.

44:49.853 --> 44:53.090
I wanna see you realize
your full potential,

44:53.190 --> 44:54.258
not selfishly,

44:54.358 --> 44:56.927
but for the industry
that we both love.

44:57.027 --> 44:59.963
I wanna build
the Crystal Tyler brand,

45:00.064 --> 45:02.566
so please, just take a seat
and hear my pitch.

45:02.666 --> 45:03.934
Sit. Sit. Sit.

45:07.438 --> 45:08.372
Come on. You're my guest.

45:08.372 --> 45:09.440
Sit down.

45:09.540 --> 45:12.676
Please just sit.

45:15.913 --> 45:18.348
I need Crystal Tyler
pay-per-views.

45:18.449 --> 45:20.617
Crystal Tyler action figures.

45:20.718 --> 45:22.019
Crystal Tyler home goods.

45:22.119 --> 45:23.721
You know what I'm
talking about, right?

45:23.821 --> 45:27.438
We both know that as long
as you stay in the DWL,

45:27.538 --> 45:28.926
that will never happen.

45:29.026 --> 45:32.409
Jack Spade can't take you
to the top, but I can.

45:32.509 --> 45:36.166
Yeah!

45:36.266 --> 45:38.802
You know, Rooster used to be
with the DWL, but, Rooster,

45:38.902 --> 45:40.771
before you started working
with me, what kind of car

45:40.871 --> 45:42.573
- did you drive?
- Tercel.

45:44.575 --> 45:45.976
It's a fine car.
It's a fine car,

45:46.076 --> 45:48.445
but what kind of car
are you driving now?

45:48.545 --> 45:49.793
Lamborghini.

45:49.893 --> 45:54.384
Whoo!

45:54.485 --> 45:58.188
I can make you a star
beyond your wildest dreams.

45:58.288 --> 46:00.390
Crystal Tyler,
I want you to join

46:00.390 --> 46:03.273
Florida Wrestling Dystopia!

46:15.906 --> 46:19.543
You know, being born
in Duffy means being born

46:19.643 --> 46:21.912
into low expectations.

46:22.012 --> 46:24.214
When you come from nothing,
it's okay to not succeed.

46:24.214 --> 46:25.749
It's probably why
I never thought of myself

46:25.849 --> 46:28.285
being worth a damn.

46:28.385 --> 46:31.655
Mr. Gully, I have been
through stuff that no kid

46:31.755 --> 46:34.258
should ever have to go through,

46:34.358 --> 46:37.294
overcame way more
than I should have.

46:37.394 --> 46:38.595
And just when I thought

46:38.695 --> 46:41.165
I couldn't squeeze out any
more fight,

46:41.265 --> 46:43.967
the Spade brothers
gave me a home.

46:44.067 --> 46:45.536
And I'm not talking
about a home

46:45.636 --> 46:48.438
with a fireplace
and a big-screen TV

46:48.539 --> 46:50.073
and a comfy, cozy couch.

46:50.174 --> 46:53.510
No, I'm talking about a home
that was built for me.

46:53.610 --> 46:55.245
The ring.

46:55.345 --> 46:56.647
Because in the ring,

46:56.747 --> 47:00.250
all the bullshit
that used to bury me

47:00.350 --> 47:03.120
can't even touch me!

47:03.220 --> 47:07.337
And so, for that, I'm forever
grateful for the Spade family.

47:07.457 --> 47:10.994
Boo!

47:11.094 --> 47:15.465
But this is a business,

47:15.566 --> 47:18.969
and it's a nasty one, at that.

47:19.069 --> 47:23.640
And there is no one looking
out for me now except for me.

47:26.543 --> 47:28.111
Truth is, Mr. Gully,

47:28.212 --> 47:32.816
I deserve everything
you offer and then some.

47:32.916 --> 47:35.719
Mm-hmm.

47:35.819 --> 47:38.488
You want Crystal Tyler
in Dystopia?

47:42.059 --> 47:44.061
You want Crystal Tyler
in Dystopia?

47:44.161 --> 47:47.064
Let's hear it, folks!

47:50.701 --> 47:52.102
Let's hear it!

47:53.837 --> 47:56.540
Well, then you know what?

47:59.376 --> 48:01.078
My answer is...

48:03.080 --> 48:04.815
...hell no!

48:04.915 --> 48:08.051
I ain't no sellout,
and I am never working

48:08.151 --> 48:10.487
for a bottom-feeding maggot
like you.

48:10.587 --> 48:13.423
DWL for life!

48:16.994 --> 48:19.630
Go on! Get out of here!

48:19.730 --> 48:20.964
All right.

48:21.064 --> 48:24.301
First, I just wanna say ow.

48:25.936 --> 48:27.838
And now that you've done
the loyalty act,

48:27.938 --> 48:29.773
let's get down to business.

48:29.873 --> 48:31.375
Help me out, Hole.

48:31.475 --> 48:33.911
This right here is
a two-year contract

48:34.011 --> 48:37.514
for you to join FWD,

48:37.614 --> 48:41.885
and right here...

48:41.985 --> 48:44.488
is $100,000!

48:44.588 --> 48:46.957
Whoo!

48:50.527 --> 48:54.398
A bonus for signing it!

48:55.866 --> 48:58.949
Did Jack Spade ever give you
this kind of an opportunity?

48:59.069 --> 49:00.871
No, he did not.

49:00.971 --> 49:04.341
You will never see
this amount of money

49:04.441 --> 49:08.812
for as long as you're
with Jack Spade and the DWL,

49:08.912 --> 49:11.014
no matter how hard you grind,

49:11.114 --> 49:13.383
no matter how much
you deserve it.

49:13.483 --> 49:16.253
But you work for me,
you will be set for life.

49:16.353 --> 49:18.822
Work for me,
and you have security

49:18.922 --> 49:21.224
for you and your loved ones.

49:21.325 --> 49:23.126
Or are you gonna throw away

49:23.226 --> 49:25.329
the biggest opportunity
of your life

49:25.429 --> 49:29.132
for some silly and blind
devotion to Jack Spade?

49:35.872 --> 49:38.709
Sign! Sign! Sign!

49:40.143 --> 49:41.611
Hey, Gully!

49:41.712 --> 49:43.293
- Boo!
- Shut up!

49:43.413 --> 49:45.916
You get the hell away from her!

49:47.250 --> 49:48.452
All right.
Let's hear him.

49:48.552 --> 49:49.820
Let's hear him out.

49:49.920 --> 49:51.989
Maybe you're hard of hearing,

49:52.089 --> 49:54.738
but you cannot buy
Crystal Tyler!

49:54.858 --> 49:57.961
She's no sellout, like you!

49:58.061 --> 50:00.998
Boo!

50:00.998 --> 50:02.212
Well, well, well, Jack.

50:02.332 --> 50:03.734
It's, uh, not really
a surprise,

50:03.834 --> 50:05.002
you showing up here tonight.

50:05.102 --> 50:06.603
I see how you're looking
at Rooster,

50:06.703 --> 50:09.673
like the one who got away,
and so you're here, now,

50:09.773 --> 50:11.475
beg Crystal to not leave too.

50:11.575 --> 50:13.176
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

50:13.276 --> 50:16.079
Crystal Tyler chooses
her own words!

50:16.179 --> 50:19.282
I'm not here to plead
with her to stay.

50:19.383 --> 50:22.619
I'm here to fight by her side!

50:22.719 --> 50:26.790
She's always had my back,
and I will always have hers!

50:26.890 --> 50:29.760
Crystal's not here
to have your back.

50:29.860 --> 50:31.495
She's here to stab you in it!

50:31.595 --> 50:33.630
Oh!

50:33.730 --> 50:35.832
Whoo!

50:35.932 --> 50:37.434
Yeah!

50:48.178 --> 50:49.646
Nice writing, Jack.

50:52.149 --> 50:54.885
Whoo!

50:54.985 --> 50:56.653
Yes!

50:56.653 --> 50:58.402
Bye-bye, Jack.

51:02.392 --> 51:03.727
Looks like we got a deal!

51:03.727 --> 51:06.863
Whoo! Dystopia!

51:06.963 --> 51:08.065
Whoo!

51:11.134 --> 51:13.303
Whoo-hoo!

51:18.909 --> 51:20.343
Looks like Jack's waking up
a bit!

51:20.444 --> 51:21.545
Get him!

51:56.646 --> 52:00.263
Wherever you are, Jack Spade,
this isn't over!

52:00.363 --> 52:02.632
Dystopia for life!

52:03.920 --> 52:06.123
Yeah!

52:08.091 --> 52:09.359
Yessir!

52:09.459 --> 52:11.428
Pop on that zipline
was fucking incredible!

52:11.528 --> 52:14.965
Aw, dude, you wrote
the shit out of that.

52:15.065 --> 52:16.600
- Crystal.
- Yeah.

52:16.700 --> 52:18.435
Crystal. Jesus.

52:18.535 --> 52:19.636
Hey, how long do you think
it'll take

52:19.736 --> 52:20.737
for the arena to clear?

52:20.837 --> 52:22.239
Hopefully soon. I gotta piss.

52:22.339 --> 52:25.041
Just go here. I'll move.

52:25.142 --> 52:26.610
What?

52:28.945 --> 52:31.081
Yeah! Whoo!

52:31.081 --> 52:34.317
Yeah!

52:45.695 --> 52:47.130
Excuse me.

52:47.230 --> 52:48.665
Somebody told me that you work
with Crystal Tyler

52:48.765 --> 52:49.599
and the Spade brothers.

52:49.599 --> 52:50.767
I do.

52:50.867 --> 52:52.068
I'm Brooks Rizzo.

52:52.169 --> 52:54.151
I would love to know
more about them.

52:54.271 --> 52:56.139
