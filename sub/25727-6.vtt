WEBVTT

00:02.270 --> 00:05.203
I mean, this place is good, but can
I get a splash of tea in there?

00:05.214 --> 00:06.422
It's all balls.

00:06.423 --> 00:08.591
Boba tea is an ancient
Taiwanese tradition

00:08.592 --> 00:10.885
that dates all the way back
to the 1980s.

00:10.886 --> 00:13.012
Could you show it a little
bit of respect? Thanks.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.889
They're not respecting me! I complained

00:14.890 --> 00:16.807
last time I was here that
they were over-balling me,

00:16.808 --> 00:18.017
and now they're over-balling
me just to piss me off.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.561
Complaining about extra boba.

00:20.562 --> 00:22.313
This is why people hate our generation.

00:22.314 --> 00:24.440
My boba tea ratio is off!

00:24.441 --> 00:26.275
Nobody cares about your boba tea ratio.

00:26.276 --> 00:28.027
- I care!
- You know what?

00:28.028 --> 00:30.321
Maybe the boba tea artist
felt like that boba tea ratio,

00:30.322 --> 00:32.292
and maybe you should respect them.

00:32.302 --> 00:33.949
You're just mad that I have
more boba balls than you.

00:33.960 --> 00:36.452
- Benji?
- Shad! What's up, man?

00:36.453 --> 00:38.079
- How are you?
- Great! Good to see you, dude.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.872
Same, dude. You got a lot
of balls there, huh?

00:39.873 --> 00:41.749
- Yeah, they over-ball me here.
- Yeah, they do that.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.417
- It's passive-aggressive.
- Who is this guy?

00:43.418 --> 00:45.183
Oh, this is Shad.

00:45.194 --> 00:47.213
- Hey, what's up?
- He was my friend in high school.

00:47.214 --> 00:49.042
I didn't know you had a friend
in high school!

00:49.053 --> 00:51.842
- Yeah, I had, like, three.
- Benji and I, we were kind of like

00:51.843 --> 00:53.527
the Matt Damon and Ben Affleck
of high school theater.

00:53.538 --> 00:54.595
- Shad!
- We were!

00:54.596 --> 00:55.596
- What?!
- But this guy...

00:55.597 --> 00:57.181
This guy was always the star.

00:57.182 --> 00:58.808
They even changed "My Fair Lady"

00:58.809 --> 01:01.060
to "My Fair Gentleman"
just so he could play the lead.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.566
Well, there's never enough parts
for guys, so that's good.

01:03.577 --> 01:05.346
Oh, dude! Speaking of
our old high school,

01:05.357 --> 01:07.358
I'm actually directing
"Romeo and Juliet" there,

01:07.359 --> 01:10.194
but I have to bail, because I
just booked a part on "Ballers."

01:10.195 --> 01:11.737
- Oh, cool, man.
- It's pretty dope.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.698
This is crazy, but I...
It's very short notice.

01:13.699 --> 01:15.199
Do you think you could cover for me?

01:15.200 --> 01:17.034
Yes, I could cover! Oh. Oh.

01:17.035 --> 01:19.495
- Esther! Get your own Shad.
- Sorry.

01:19.496 --> 01:21.722
Dramatic teens are my bread and butter.
I'm sorry.

01:21.733 --> 01:23.374
Bread and cheese
is your bread and butter.

01:23.375 --> 01:24.467
Both can be true.

01:25.669 --> 01:27.753
Um, Shad, is it OK if my friend Esther

01:27.754 --> 01:29.832
joins me on this directing venture?

01:29.843 --> 01:31.465
Yeah, that... that work,
I really don't care.

01:31.476 --> 01:33.477
As long as you cover for me,
you can bring whoever you want.

01:33.488 --> 01:35.344
Hey, just, uh... E-mail me, all right?

01:35.345 --> 01:38.031
- I'll shoot you the deets, everything.
- All right, cool, man. Thank you.

01:38.042 --> 01:40.099
You like that?
It's my new business card.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.892
It's got my headshot on front,
IMDb on back.

01:41.893 --> 01:44.128
I'm familiar with the headshot medium.
Thank you.

01:44.139 --> 01:46.022
- All right, e-mail me, all right?
- All right, cool.

01:46.023 --> 01:47.398
- Nice to see you, man.
- Same!

01:47.399 --> 01:49.692
He was a corpse
on "Law &amp; Order"?

01:49.693 --> 01:53.113
Lucky! That's my dream
entry-level acting job.

01:55.741 --> 01:56.741
Good, huh?

01:56.742 --> 01:57.743
Yeah.

01:57.754 --> 02:01.410
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

02:02.622 --> 02:03.998
Well, that's cool that you decided

02:03.999 --> 02:05.833
to dress like a teen mom
Christmas shopping

02:05.834 --> 02:07.626
at Dollar Tree
for your first day at work.

02:07.627 --> 02:11.631
Key word: "teen."
They're gonna relate to me.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.858
Ugh. I'm getting high school flashbacks.

02:13.869 --> 02:15.593
One time, I was walking up to school,

02:15.594 --> 02:18.638
and Lindsay Pierce asked me
if I wanted a cigarette.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.931
Needless to say, I un-friended her ass

02:20.932 --> 02:22.350
before I got to homeroom.

02:22.351 --> 02:24.808
There were, like, ten Lindsays in my
school. None of them would talk to me.

02:24.819 --> 02:27.843
Ey-O! Substitute teacher coming through!

02:27.854 --> 02:29.273
Sir, I don't know if anyone told you,

02:29.274 --> 02:32.234
but a gorilla left his pubes
on your head.

02:32.235 --> 02:34.195
Oh, come on. Don't be like that.

02:34.196 --> 02:36.614
Hey, gorillas are beautiful,
majestic creatures!

02:36.615 --> 02:38.991
Hey! Shut your degenerate ass up.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.326
It's not his fault he's ugly!

02:42.371 --> 02:44.789
Gorillas don't even have pubes.
Their fur is consistent.

02:44.790 --> 02:47.208
Benji, don't let that kid
get to you, OK?

02:47.209 --> 02:49.210
Boys like that,
they peak in high school.

02:49.211 --> 02:52.213
You haven't even reached your peak yet.

02:52.214 --> 02:53.839
You may never peak.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.174
You ready?

02:55.175 --> 02:57.385
Let's do this!

02:57.386 --> 03:00.054
- Hello, actors!
- Hello!

03:00.055 --> 03:01.639
- Yes?
- Sir, I'm not an actor.

03:01.640 --> 03:03.224
I'm Kevin. I'm your technician.

03:03.225 --> 03:04.685
Wonderful, Kevin. Get me a Snapple.

03:05.686 --> 03:08.062
Hi, everyone. I am Benji.

03:08.063 --> 03:09.730
I am so excited to be here.

03:09.731 --> 03:12.233
Um... I'm actually a former student.

03:12.234 --> 03:15.319
Some of you might recognize me,
or maybe you've heard of me

03:15.320 --> 03:19.907
from the critically acclaimed
production of "The Wizard of Oz,"

03:19.908 --> 03:22.284
where I played the Wizard
and the Cowardly Lion.

03:22.285 --> 03:24.204
I can get dressed
and undressed really fast.

03:25.403 --> 03:27.905
Is that a weird thing to tell
a room full of children?

03:27.916 --> 03:31.085
It wasn't... You guys got
what I meant, right?

03:31.086 --> 03:33.045
- What?
- Anyways...

03:33.046 --> 03:36.048
I'm Esther,
and you can call me "Estella,"

03:36.049 --> 03:38.467
'cause that's the version
of my name I always wanted.

03:38.468 --> 03:41.680
Why? Because once we walk
through those doors,

03:43.056 --> 03:45.808
we're anyone we want to be!

03:45.809 --> 03:48.102
That's what we're bringin'.

03:48.103 --> 03:50.479
Now, did someone here
order some journals

03:50.480 --> 03:52.089
with a side of self-discovery?

03:52.100 --> 03:53.673
What is it with you and the journaling?

03:53.684 --> 03:55.812
Are you trying to run a sober
living house or something?

03:55.823 --> 03:57.778
In my high school drama class,
we journaled,

03:57.779 --> 03:59.447
because it allowed us to dive deeper

03:59.448 --> 04:01.283
into ourselves and our characters.

04:02.474 --> 04:04.493
Every role she got
in high school had one line.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.412
But I knew their psychology.

04:06.413 --> 04:09.623
Elegant Partygoer was elegant.
She went to parties.

04:09.624 --> 04:14.044
She entered on page 14. She exited
stage right, interesting choice.

04:14.045 --> 04:16.380
All right, now, don't be shy.
You can write

04:16.380 --> 04:18.423
your deepest, darkest secrets
in these journals,

04:18.425 --> 04:21.177
because no one is gonna read
them, except for me.

04:21.178 --> 04:23.387
Can I have the purple glittery one?

04:23.388 --> 04:26.056
Oh, um... That one's actually mine.

04:26.057 --> 04:28.477
But... I want you to have it.

04:30.762 --> 04:34.040
All right, we're gonna start
with a game called "Zip Zap Zop."

04:34.051 --> 04:35.941
It's a little silly,
but we're just trying

04:35.942 --> 04:37.568
to warm up our bodies and our minds.

04:37.569 --> 04:40.462
Oh, good. There you are. Um...
Hey, I just wanted to apologize.

04:40.473 --> 04:43.115
I'm sorry. We're doing
a theatre exercise.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.978
Detention's probably down the hall.

04:44.989 --> 04:47.313
I'm the lead. Romeo.

04:48.872 --> 04:50.121
Your Snapple, sir.

04:50.132 --> 04:52.299
Techy Kev, is that guy really
the lead of the play?

04:52.310 --> 04:53.623
Affirmative, sir. That's Logan.

04:53.634 --> 04:55.878
Look, earlier, when I
called you "Gorilla Pubes,"

04:55.879 --> 04:59.298
that was body-shaming,
and that is not OK.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.175
- Thank you.
- And in a messed-up society

05:01.176 --> 05:03.511
that places so much value on appearance,

05:03.512 --> 05:06.637
I can't imagine
what you go through every day.

05:06.648 --> 05:08.130
OK, that's enough. Thank you.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.391
Uh, we're gonna start the game.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.477
Cool? I'll start.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.604
- Zip!
- Uh... Zap!

05:13.605 --> 05:14.878
Great job. Zop!

05:15.649 --> 05:17.066
Zi... uh, I'm sorry.

05:17.067 --> 05:19.443
Uh, I don't think clapping at my peers

05:19.444 --> 05:20.800
is really gonna help me.

05:20.811 --> 05:22.655
Uh, my character has to commit suicide,

05:22.656 --> 05:24.615
so... think I'm just gonna go meditate.

05:24.616 --> 05:26.075
Logan, come on, man!

05:26.076 --> 05:28.202
I can teach you stuff
about acting, all right?

05:28.203 --> 05:31.080
I was a SoundCloud
Artist to Watch in 2015.

05:31.081 --> 05:32.581
Yeah, well, I'm repped by Gersh.

05:32.582 --> 05:34.583
Is that what it's about?
I'm a stand-up comedian.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.377
- A professional.
- It's impressive.

05:36.378 --> 05:40.506
Guess what else is impressive?
Daniel Tosh follows me on Twitter.

05:40.507 --> 05:43.467
Yeah, maybe I should DM him
and see if he's heard of you.

05:43.468 --> 05:45.427
You know what?
Are we allowed cell phones?

05:45.428 --> 05:48.597
I don't think so. And I'm not
impressed by Daniel Tosh, OK?

05:48.598 --> 05:51.725
I'm not a frat guy in 2003.

05:51.726 --> 05:53.949
Not to mention, if we're playing
the name-dropping game,

05:53.960 --> 05:56.605
I'm friends with Pauly Shore.
Full-blown friends.

05:56.606 --> 05:58.440
I know his Hotmail address.

05:58.441 --> 06:00.317
What's Hotmail?

06:00.318 --> 06:01.888
Dude, nobody knows who that guy is.

06:03.131 --> 06:05.465
Techy Kev, you know
who Pauly Shore is, right?

06:05.476 --> 06:07.517
Affirmative. He's one of
the "Stranger Things" kids.

06:07.528 --> 06:09.911
- Right?
- Zip!

06:12.153 --> 06:15.898
Hey, can I borrow a quarter?
It's sort of an emergency.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.918
Oh, my God. Yes, of course.

06:17.919 --> 06:20.421
Thank you for feeling
safe enough to ask me.

06:20.422 --> 06:21.630
- Of course.
- Here you go.

06:21.631 --> 06:24.508
Oh, I've never used a tampon. I use...

06:24.509 --> 06:25.843
pads.

06:25.844 --> 06:27.261
Oh, I have one of those, too.

06:27.262 --> 06:29.019
Thanks! You are, like,
such a cool grown-up!

06:29.030 --> 06:30.086
- Really?
- Yeah!

06:30.097 --> 06:32.172
Like the coolest grown-up I've ever met.

06:32.183 --> 06:36.103
Oh, my God! I'm, like, barely
a grown-up, just so you know.

06:36.104 --> 06:37.813
I'm so glad Mr. Shad's gone.

06:37.814 --> 06:39.815
- Same.
- OK, I gotta go. Thanks!

06:39.816 --> 06:41.734
I lost them. They're all meditating.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.375
When I was a kid,
I stared off into space,

06:43.386 --> 06:44.927
and they wanted to put me on medicine.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.156
I found her, Benji.

06:46.167 --> 06:48.657
She's the wing for me
to be the wind beneath.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.367
- That girl?
- Yeah.

06:50.368 --> 06:53.662
Stop trying to befriend 12-year-old
girls. You're an adult.

06:53.663 --> 06:57.626
Ow! It's like the third time I've
been slapped in this hallway.

06:59.669 --> 07:02.379
This was so much fun.
I stayed up all night.

07:02.380 --> 07:03.672
- I couldn't stop.
- Oh, my God.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.549
You journaled as your character?

07:05.550 --> 07:09.094
She hid in a dead horse
to escape an evil friar?

07:09.095 --> 07:12.181
That is such a cool
backstory for Wench Three.

07:12.182 --> 07:13.932
Well, nobody is born a wench.

07:13.933 --> 07:15.934
That's so true. It makes me wonder,

07:15.935 --> 07:18.645
where does Jane end
and Wench three begin?

07:18.656 --> 07:20.900
You know, when my high school
did "Fiddler on the Roof,"

07:20.911 --> 07:22.954
I would have dreams as Jew Number Four.

07:22.965 --> 07:26.195
All right, everybody, listen up.
We're gonna start with the end

07:26.206 --> 07:27.916
of Act Two, Scene Two.

07:32.535 --> 07:34.745
What satisfaction canst
thou have tonight?

07:34.746 --> 07:37.623
- The exchange of thy love's faithful vow...
- Stop! Stop!

07:37.624 --> 07:39.083
Logan, I can't hear you.

07:39.084 --> 07:41.126
We got the senior citizens
in the back row, so...

07:41.127 --> 07:42.920
Projection! Thank you.

07:42.921 --> 07:46.382
Psst. Doesn't your eye
keep going to Wench Three?

07:46.383 --> 07:48.300
The camera loves her.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.928
- There's no camera.
- What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?

07:50.929 --> 07:54.056
- Exchange of thy love's faithful vows...
- Logan!

07:54.057 --> 07:56.558
I love what you're doing,
but... How do I put this?

07:56.559 --> 08:00.729
I'm 86 years old. I was a propeller
engineer in the Korean War.

08:00.730 --> 08:04.983
Bad hearing, back row, maybe my last
day on Earth, and I can't hear ya.

08:04.984 --> 08:07.778
The exchange
of thy love's faithful vows...

08:07.779 --> 08:10.948
Logan! Logan! Does "loud" mean "angry"?

08:10.949 --> 08:14.868
Tulips! Huh! Puppies! Huh!
You see that? Loud, not angry.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.704
Dude, I know how to project.

08:16.705 --> 08:18.455
Think, um... yeah, last I checked,

08:18.456 --> 08:20.416
I'm the director,
and you've got to respect me.

08:20.417 --> 08:21.667
Do you respect you?

08:22.669 --> 08:23.752
That's not the point.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.671
The point is, is I can't hear you.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.673
You know, my therapist says
insecurities are common

08:27.674 --> 08:30.384
in people who weren't breast-fed.
I'm guessing you weren't.

08:30.385 --> 08:32.635
I didn't say anything!

08:32.636 --> 08:35.556
I rejected the breast.
I preferred formula.

08:35.557 --> 08:37.349
Did your mom freeze her breast milk?
'Cause I'll take it.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.600
I mean, it's good for you.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.686
- Olympians drink it.
- This is inappropriate!

08:40.687 --> 08:42.770
You're not drinking
my mom's breast milk!

08:42.772 --> 08:45.441
We're going to the principal's
office right now! Let's go!

08:45.442 --> 08:47.359
Take that off. You don't
deserve to wear it.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.236
- Real face-to-face nuisance.
- Guys...

08:49.237 --> 08:53.782
Not every baby can latch, OK?
And for the record,

08:53.783 --> 08:56.785
I did easily, and I was
breast-fed until I was four.

08:56.786 --> 09:00.289
And that is true, and it is
both beautiful and problematic.

09:00.290 --> 09:02.708
OK, let's plow forward.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.084
But how? We don't have Logan.

09:04.085 --> 09:06.253
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, oh, my God.

09:06.254 --> 09:08.088
I've always wanted a reason to say this.

09:08.089 --> 09:11.009
The show must go on!

09:12.510 --> 09:15.220
"Oh, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"

09:15.221 --> 09:17.291
- What satisfaction canst thou have...
- Stop!

09:17.302 --> 09:20.017
- Something's not working.
- Well, maybe 'cause you're reading it.

09:20.018 --> 09:21.435
With no energy or eye contact.

09:21.436 --> 09:22.478
No, no. That's not it.

09:22.479 --> 09:24.146
- No?
- No, no, no.

09:24.147 --> 09:26.690
Let's try something. Stacie,
take a seat for a second.

09:26.691 --> 09:27.859
I'll take that.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.738
- Take a seat, please.
- OK.

09:33.031 --> 09:34.364
What are we thinkin' here?

09:37.744 --> 09:39.119
Jane.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.580
Why don't you try reading Juliet?

09:41.581 --> 09:43.582
- What?
- Yeah, why not!

09:43.583 --> 09:45.210
Let's try it.

09:47.837 --> 09:51.840
"The exchange of thy love's
faithful vow for mine."

09:51.841 --> 09:55.969
"I gave thee mine
before thou did this..."

09:55.970 --> 09:58.097
- Wow.
- "...request it?"

09:58.098 --> 09:59.099
Did you see that?

10:01.017 --> 10:03.685
- You're our new Juliet.
- Wait, what?!

10:03.686 --> 10:05.854
You are what this play was missing.

10:05.855 --> 10:07.523
I'm... I'm sorry, like, 'scuse me?

10:07.524 --> 10:08.899
Oh, Stacie, congratulations.

10:08.900 --> 10:11.110
You're gonna be an amazing Wench Three.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.267
Uh, duh-no. You can't do this.
We open on Thursday.

10:13.278 --> 10:15.493
Oh, you'll master Wench Three
by then. There's no lines.

10:15.504 --> 10:17.595
But my grandparents
are driving in from Arizona!

10:17.606 --> 10:19.165
I don't know what you want
me to do here.

10:19.176 --> 10:21.078
I already said the show must go on.

10:21.079 --> 10:23.039
Jane, everybody!

10:31.089 --> 10:34.360
Well, thank you, Benji, for
bringing that to our attention.

10:34.371 --> 10:37.302
Although, some of those breast feeding
details were a little bit graphic.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.263
Just wanted you to have all the info.

10:39.264 --> 10:42.224
Logan, I expect more of you.

10:42.225 --> 10:43.809
What have you got to say for yourself?

10:43.810 --> 10:45.894
Yeah, Logan. I'd like to know
as well. Speak up.

10:45.895 --> 10:48.856
I'm sorry, Mr. Benji.

10:48.857 --> 10:50.732
I've just been having
a really weird day,

10:50.733 --> 10:55.821
because it's the anniversary
of my parents' divorce.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.990
A divorce that was totally my fault.

10:57.991 --> 10:58.991
It wasn't your fault.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.492
Almost every divorce

11:00.493 --> 11:02.536
my mom has is my fault.

11:02.537 --> 11:04.913
Everybody leaves me. Shad left me,

11:04.914 --> 11:07.958
- and now this guy is yelling at me.
- Listen.

11:07.959 --> 11:09.961
Why don't you give us a moment, OK?

11:11.296 --> 11:13.548
Thank you.

11:19.173 --> 11:20.971
You know every time
one of these kids cries,

11:20.972 --> 11:22.765
I gotta fill out a form?

11:24.142 --> 11:27.561
Logan. Logan. I'm so sorry.

11:27.562 --> 11:29.855
I had no idea you were
dealing with all that.

11:29.856 --> 11:33.150
If you ever want to talk, I had a
really hard time in high school, too.

11:33.151 --> 11:34.776
- I'm here.
- No, it's just...

11:34.777 --> 11:37.112
my dad, and...

11:37.113 --> 11:40.073
I drive people away, and...

11:40.074 --> 11:41.783
and...

11:41.784 --> 11:43.535
aaand scene!

11:43.536 --> 11:45.984
See? I'm an amazing actor.

11:45.995 --> 11:47.998
Was I projecting enough
for you, or was that...?

11:47.999 --> 11:50.167
- Or should I still speak up?
- I knew you were lying.

11:50.168 --> 11:51.585
I don't know. I think I had
you going, there, buddy.

11:51.586 --> 11:53.462
- I was acting, dude!
- Oh! Oh, gotcha.

11:53.463 --> 11:55.756
I was acting like I believed you!
And scene!

11:55.757 --> 11:57.530
You don't "scene" me! I "scene" you!

11:58.436 --> 12:02.499
"So... loving...
j-jealous of his liberty."

12:03.181 --> 12:06.934
Yes. And then Romeo says
whatever, and great job.

12:06.935 --> 12:09.019
OK, everyone's dismissed,

12:09.020 --> 12:10.938
except for Jane.
Why don't you grab a snack?

12:10.939 --> 12:12.440
You're gonna need the fuel.

12:15.652 --> 12:17.152
Hey, so I just wanted to let you know

12:17.153 --> 12:19.696
I had to recast Juliet,
and it's Jane now.

12:19.697 --> 12:21.865
OK, yeah, I don't care about Jane.
Logan's my problem.

12:21.866 --> 12:23.670
He's good-looking, and he can fake-cry.

12:23.681 --> 12:25.369
Fake-crying should be
only for ugly people

12:25.370 --> 12:27.258
- who actually need the attention.
- I agree.

12:27.269 --> 12:28.705
That kid's an emotional terrorist.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.958
- Nobody needs him!
- Benji, settle down.

12:30.959 --> 12:32.376
The drama kids love Logan.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.002
I'm catching up on journals.

12:34.013 --> 12:35.796
Is it legal that you read
their journals?

12:35.797 --> 12:37.839
Did you sign the same waiver I did?

12:37.840 --> 12:40.027
I didn't sign that, no.
I have a thing against waivers.

12:40.038 --> 12:41.949
Oh, yeah, so then, yeah,
you can probably read.

12:41.960 --> 12:43.387
So, Emma K wrote,

12:43.388 --> 12:46.014
"I watched a movie with Logan
last night at his house."

12:46.015 --> 12:48.225
We dry scissored, and then
walked to Scooter Burger.

12:48.226 --> 12:51.353
"It was super romantic."

12:51.354 --> 12:52.479
Teen love.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.203
- So they walked to Scooter Burger?
- Yeah.

12:54.214 --> 12:55.357
But that doesn't make sense.

12:55.358 --> 12:57.206
There's no fast food allowed
in Beverly Hills.

12:57.217 --> 12:59.444
- 'Scue me?
- No fast food allowed in Beverly Hills.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.738
This is the first time I've
ever felt bad for rich kids.

13:01.739 --> 13:03.865
He lives by a Scooter Burger,
he's out of district.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.742
I might have to report him.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.995
It's kind of my responsibility
as a freelance, part-time,

13:07.996 --> 13:10.777
unpaid substitute teacher
for an after-school club.

13:10.788 --> 13:13.339
- Think I gotta follow him home.
- No, no, no, no, no, Benji.

13:13.350 --> 13:14.793
That's a bad idea.

13:19.486 --> 13:21.814
Hey, man, how come
you didn't want to eat inside?

13:24.470 --> 13:26.263
So, I'm happy we're hanging out.

13:26.264 --> 13:27.597
Just want to put that out there.

13:27.598 --> 13:29.808
- OK.
- But also, full disclosure,

13:29.809 --> 13:32.394
we're on a stakeout, and I need you here
in case things escalate.

13:32.395 --> 13:35.647
Come on, man! It...
You told me you missed me!

13:35.648 --> 13:38.358
I do miss you! This is a "two
birds, one stone" situation.

13:38.359 --> 13:40.068
I needed a partner in my stakeout,

13:40.069 --> 13:41.237
and I love you.

13:42.030 --> 13:43.947
Look, do you see that...
that kid over there?

13:43.948 --> 13:45.115
Yes.

13:45.116 --> 13:47.617
He's been bullying me at school.

13:49.245 --> 13:51.496
I'm so s..., I... I tried.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.123
You're getting bullied by a child?

13:53.124 --> 13:55.939
I mean... childhood
is a social construct.

13:55.950 --> 13:57.878
We don't know when it starts
or ends, really.

13:57.879 --> 13:59.963
All right, bud. I am gonna go ahead

13:59.964 --> 14:02.549
and pull the ripcord on this situation.
I'm calling a Lyft.

14:02.550 --> 14:05.761
I can't be out here stalking children.
I'm an uncle!

14:05.762 --> 14:07.888
Jeff, stop being so weird, OK?

14:07.889 --> 14:09.890
All we have to do
is follow this kid home.

14:09.891 --> 14:11.559
Do you hear yourself?

14:13.102 --> 14:14.561
Oh, my God. He's leaving.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.022
Jane?

14:17.273 --> 14:18.273
Jane!

14:18.274 --> 14:19.524
Yes?

14:19.525 --> 14:21.359
Onstage, please.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.278
A-five, six, seven, eight!

14:23.279 --> 14:26.031
I'm Romeo! Come find me!

14:26.032 --> 14:28.283
And you're wearing a blindfold, too?

14:28.284 --> 14:29.534
Hundred percent.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.328
I don't see how this is gonna help.

14:31.329 --> 14:33.914
Jane, if you can
walk the stage blindfolded,

14:33.915 --> 14:36.666
think about how easy that's
gonna be on show night.

14:36.667 --> 14:37.751
Whatever you say.

14:37.752 --> 14:40.295
Over here! Find me, Juliet!

14:40.296 --> 14:43.006
"There rust and yet me..."

14:43.007 --> 14:45.926
Sorry. "Let me die."

14:45.927 --> 14:47.135
I've got an idea.

14:47.136 --> 14:50.347
Why don't we try adding an "ouch"?

14:50.348 --> 14:52.099
- "Ouch?"
- "Ouch!"

14:52.100 --> 14:53.975
- "Ouch!"
- Nope. Do it again.

14:53.976 --> 14:56.937
- Romeo? Romeo?
- Hark! Hark! Hark! Hark!

14:56.938 --> 14:58.897
- Find me! Pliet!
- Romeo! Romeo!

14:58.898 --> 15:00.357
- "Ouch!"
- "Ouch!"

15:00.358 --> 15:02.067
- "Ouch!"
- "Ouch!"

15:02.068 --> 15:04.778
I'm sorry. I just can't get this.

15:04.779 --> 15:07.155
- Make haste!
- Romeo! Ugh! Ouch!

15:07.156 --> 15:10.826
Yes, Jane, yes! That's the
"ouch" I'm looking for!

15:10.827 --> 15:12.369
I knew I'd get it out of you.

15:12.370 --> 15:13.871
Can I go to the nurse?

15:15.665 --> 15:17.040
Benji, Benji, Benji!

15:17.041 --> 15:19.000
Hey, what's up? I have great news.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.253
I did some light
child stalking yesterday,

15:21.254 --> 15:22.921
and I was right about Logan.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.757
- He does live outside of district.
- Benji, you shouldn't stalk Logan.

15:25.758 --> 15:28.135
He's a high school kid. Hey...

15:28.136 --> 15:30.637
Do you know Jane's
class schedule, locker combo,

15:30.638 --> 15:33.390
or home address? Can't find her.

15:33.391 --> 15:35.461
Hey, Midriff. You seen Jane?

15:35.472 --> 15:36.930
- Psh.
- Yeah, if I tell the school,

15:36.941 --> 15:39.512
Logan for sure gets kicked out,
but I wanna be the bigger person,

15:39.523 --> 15:42.023
so I'm just gonna blackmail him
so he pretends to respect me.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.859
Blackmail, cool.
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

15:43.860 --> 15:46.027
Hey, can you give me one second? Jane!

15:46.028 --> 15:47.404
Where are you?!

15:51.242 --> 15:54.244
Logan. I can't believe this
is our last time hanging out.

15:54.245 --> 15:55.871
I've had so much fun with you.

15:55.872 --> 15:58.248
- Thanks.
- But just, um, one last note,

15:58.249 --> 15:59.576
- before your big show?
- Yeah.

15:59.587 --> 16:01.293
Don't cross the line,
or I'll destroy you.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.086
Oh! You feelin' tough?

16:03.087 --> 16:05.797
You know what? I would
just play it cool, dude.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.419
But I... I don't know.

16:07.430 --> 16:10.635
Maybe you'll end up in the Reseda
High production of "The Lion King."

16:10.636 --> 16:12.010
What do you think
their felt budget's like?

16:12.021 --> 16:13.138
Probably not good!

16:13.139 --> 16:14.681
Come on, man. You wouldn't say anything.

16:14.682 --> 16:16.850
- I wouldn't?
- They'd kick me out of school.

16:16.851 --> 16:20.228
I'm so sorry. I...

16:20.229 --> 16:22.939
- I was just overcompensating because...
- Oh, is this...?

16:22.940 --> 16:24.232
Is this, are you going to
start crying again?

16:24.233 --> 16:26.010
- What?
- I know all your moves.

16:26.021 --> 16:28.737
Just...
don't disrespect me,

16:28.738 --> 16:31.518
and things should be
<i>muy bueno</i> between us.

16:31.529 --> 16:33.658
Are you doing Pacino from "Scarface"?

16:33.659 --> 16:36.953
Yeah.
Have a fun time tonight.

16:36.954 --> 16:39.081
That last one was Brando. I got range.

16:43.794 --> 16:45.212
- Hi!
- Can I help you?

16:45.213 --> 16:46.880
You must be Jane's mom. I'm Esther.

16:46.881 --> 16:48.590
I'm her director-slash-best-friend,

16:48.591 --> 16:50.258
and I don't want to alarm you,

16:50.259 --> 16:52.260
but Jane is 30 minutes late
for the play,

16:52.261 --> 16:54.179
and I know how much this means to her.

16:54.180 --> 16:56.598
I think it's safe to say she's
been murdered or kidnapped.

16:56.599 --> 17:00.185
She's here. I... I'm sorry, but she's
not interested in doing the play.

17:00.186 --> 17:03.104
Huh. OK. I see what's going on here.

17:03.105 --> 17:05.022
My parents held me back, too.
Let me guess...

17:05.023 --> 17:08.484
You gave up on your dreams,
and you took the easy road.

17:08.486 --> 17:10.319
Married a rich guy, settled down.

17:10.320 --> 17:12.698
I'm the co-chairman
of Sony Entertainment.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.328
Cool. Cool, cool, cool.

17:18.913 --> 17:20.538
I have a headshot
and resume in my trunk.

17:20.539 --> 17:23.124
If you... would... just...
First, can you hand over Jane?

17:23.125 --> 17:25.794
Esther! Stop! She's telling the truth!

17:25.795 --> 17:27.170
I don't want to do the play!

17:27.171 --> 17:28.588
You made it weird!

17:28.589 --> 17:31.091
Plus, Stacie and the whole cast
hate me now.

17:31.092 --> 17:32.551
I eat lunch alone.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.177
I'll eat lunch with you, Silly-Head!

17:34.178 --> 17:38.306
I don't want to eat with you!
Just leave me alone!

17:38.307 --> 17:40.017
Uh, what?

17:41.561 --> 17:44.563
Not everyone's cut out for show biz.

17:44.564 --> 17:47.357
Should we get a lunch
on the books, or, uh...?

17:47.358 --> 17:48.709
SoulCycle? Oh.

17:51.904 --> 17:52.904
OK...

17:54.574 --> 17:57.118
I'm sorry. Someone's defaced your photo.

17:58.202 --> 18:00.287
You're finally breastfeeding!

18:00.288 --> 18:01.841
Hilarious.

18:01.852 --> 18:03.665
But if you really wanted
this joke to land,

18:03.666 --> 18:05.750
you should have used an orangutan,

18:05.751 --> 18:08.169
'cause they're the primate
champions of breastfeeding.

18:08.170 --> 18:09.963
- Look it up.
- Don't worry.

18:09.964 --> 18:12.173
We're gonna find out who did this.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.051
Oh, I think I know who did it.

18:15.177 --> 18:17.220
It wasn't me, I swear!

18:17.221 --> 18:20.140
But it's so funny! And you're so funny!

18:20.141 --> 18:23.143
Speaking of "funny,"
you know what's hilarious?

18:23.144 --> 18:26.563
Logan lives in Reseda.

18:26.564 --> 18:28.023
Sorry, bud. I didn't want to do it,

18:28.024 --> 18:29.858
but you kind of forced my hand.

18:29.859 --> 18:32.402
He lives out of district.
Out of district.

18:32.403 --> 18:33.903
But... I'm sorry.

18:33.904 --> 18:36.406
After my dad died, we just...

18:36.407 --> 18:38.576
couldn't afford to stay
in Beverly Hills anymore.

18:39.994 --> 18:42.120
I was just too embarrassed
to tell everyone.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.289
Moving performance.

18:45.666 --> 18:47.792
But I think your story's not adding up.

18:47.793 --> 18:51.212
You know, 'cause yesterday, it
was that your dad left your mom,

18:51.213 --> 18:53.423
and now he's dead, and...
How does a corpse

18:53.424 --> 18:55.383
leave your mom? You know what I mean?

18:55.384 --> 18:58.178
He left my mom,
and five years later, he died.

19:03.434 --> 19:05.477
This is, uh...

19:05.478 --> 19:08.104
It's gonna be hard for me
to come back from.

19:09.482 --> 19:10.982
Everyone, don't worry.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.985
Logan's gonna continue
to attend this school.

19:15.363 --> 19:17.322
We make exceptions all the time.

19:17.323 --> 19:18.698
Thank you.

19:18.699 --> 19:20.167
Everyone!

19:21.327 --> 19:24.329
Okay, so, like,
if we didn't have a Juliet,

19:24.330 --> 19:25.747
how bad would that be?

19:28.250 --> 19:32.003
OK, so, bad. Um, Stacie?

19:32.004 --> 19:33.838
Where is my sweet Stacie?

19:33.839 --> 19:35.382
She quit two days ago.

19:35.383 --> 19:37.300
OK, now what?

19:37.301 --> 19:39.344
You're gonna play Juliet, right, ma'am?

19:39.345 --> 19:40.470
I... I couldn't.

19:40.471 --> 19:41.805
We all saw this coming.

19:41.806 --> 19:43.257
If you insist, I'll do it.

19:44.058 --> 19:45.267
You guys are good kids.

19:47.269 --> 19:49.062
Oh, happy dagger!

19:49.063 --> 19:52.232
This is thy sheath.
There rust, and let me die.

19:54.000 --> 20:00.074

Her actual dying is a little much,

20:08.541 --> 20:10.710
but as a corpse,
I think she's gonna nail it.

20:19.009 --> 20:22.303
Techy Kevin, did you make the
photo of me suckling a gorilla?

20:22.304 --> 20:23.972
Affirmative, sir.

20:23.973 --> 20:25.098
Why?

20:25.099 --> 20:26.850
Um, sir, I don't respect you.

20:26.851 --> 20:28.309
Was it something I did, or...?

20:28.310 --> 20:29.894
No, just you.

20:29.895 --> 20:32.012
I get that.
