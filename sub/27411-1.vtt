"Pep Girl Twins,"
issue 437.

00:48.881 --> 00:52.449
"The Diabolical
Dr. Shark Hands."

00:52.451 --> 00:55.885
Ohh, this is gonna be
so good.

00:55.887 --> 00:58.725
Finally, a supervillain
with some teeth.

01:14.373 --> 01:15.375
What's that?
Who's there?

01:30.756 --> 01:33.257
Oh, come on!

01:33.259 --> 01:35.291
You gotta be kidding me!

01:35.293 --> 01:37.627
Why do the bad guys
always lose?

01:37.629 --> 01:39.897
Dr. Shark Hands
is the coolest.

01:39.899 --> 01:43.833
I mean, he literally has
sharks for hands.

01:43.835 --> 01:46.403
And then he gets taken out
with pom-poms!

01:46.405 --> 01:48.639
Who writes this?

01:48.641 --> 01:49.773
If I was a supervillain,

01:49.775 --> 01:52.412
I'd win every time.

02:14.667 --> 02:16.568
Hiya!

02:59.578 --> 03:01.511
What a weirdo.

03:01.513 --> 03:05.448
No wonder no one's adopted him.

03:05.450 --> 03:06.716
- Lester!
- Huh?

03:06.718 --> 03:08.018
Sit down!

03:08.020 --> 03:11.354
Comic book nerd!
Comic book nerd!

03:14.026 --> 03:15.662
Hang in there, Lester.

03:17.729 --> 03:20.632
Only 112 more days to go.

03:56.801 --> 03:59.369
Let's go, henchmen.
Move it out!

03:59.371 --> 04:01.571
You too, newbie!

04:01.573 --> 04:02.842
Wow.

04:05.911 --> 04:07.643
Uh, uh-oh.

04:07.645 --> 04:10.282
Wait!
Hold that elevator!

04:13.919 --> 04:15.518
Wh-ho-ho!

04:15.520 --> 04:17.654
Hey. Hey, pal.
Check it out.

04:17.656 --> 04:19.089
A real supervillain lair.

04:19.091 --> 04:22.591
Huh? You don't see
many of these around.

04:22.593 --> 04:24.264
Good. Next.

04:25.564 --> 04:27.563
- Next.
- Is this spray cheese?

04:27.565 --> 04:29.933
Yes. Next!

04:29.935 --> 04:31.435
Henchmen!

04:31.437 --> 04:32.668
At attention!

04:32.670 --> 04:34.671
The Gluttonator
will now speak.

04:34.673 --> 04:37.007
No way!

04:37.009 --> 04:40.543
First...
Excuse me for that.

04:40.545 --> 04:42.878
First...

04:42.880 --> 04:45.682
We unleash my Gouda guns
on the coastal city.

04:47.019 --> 04:48.551
This is the best thing
I've ever seen.

04:48.553 --> 04:52.488
Mm! Then we unleash
the Swiss missiles,

04:52.490 --> 04:56.593
and Provoloneum bombs
on the inland centers.

04:57.696 --> 05:00.096
Before noon...

05:00.098 --> 05:01.697
Uhh, excuse me again.

05:01.699 --> 05:03.367
Every major city
on the continent

05:03.369 --> 05:05.000
will be ten feet deep

05:05.002 --> 05:09.572
in molten,
radioactive cheese!

05:13.846 --> 05:15.878
Hey, why aren't they laughing?

05:15.880 --> 05:18.848
Henchmen,
maniacal laugh now!

05:20.853 --> 05:22.985
Better.

05:27.759 --> 05:29.625
Another day,

05:29.627 --> 05:32.461
another deluded maniac
with a terrible plan.

05:32.463 --> 05:33.897
What was that, Hank?

05:33.899 --> 05:36.500
Oh, nothin', Steve.
She's all fixed.

05:36.502 --> 05:38.871
- Great. Thanks.
- Hey, it's what I do.

05:40.605 --> 05:43.005
So, you guard the cheese
on the elevator, huh?

05:43.007 --> 05:45.675
What are we talkin',
Swiss? Gouda?

05:45.677 --> 05:48.144
Cheddar? Sharp?
We doin' sharp Cheddar?

05:48.146 --> 05:49.745
What is this,
New Zealand grass fed?

05:49.747 --> 05:51.180
Morning, Jane.

05:51.182 --> 05:52.515
How's super evil's

05:52.517 --> 05:54.618
princess of pipe fitting
doing today?

05:54.620 --> 05:56.485
Oh, not bad,

05:56.487 --> 05:58.087
but call me princess
again, boss,

05:58.089 --> 06:01.490
and you'll be getting
a pipe wrench in the old wazoo.

06:01.492 --> 06:03.026
Oh, would you
look at the time.

06:03.028 --> 06:04.627
Gotta dash.
See ya at lunch.

06:04.629 --> 06:06.630
Okay. You be careful
out there.

06:06.632 --> 06:09.031
Radioactive cheese
comin' through.

06:09.033 --> 06:10.166
I'm all in.

06:10.168 --> 06:12.101
Ha-ha! Royal flush.

06:12.103 --> 06:13.536
Again?!
That's impossible!

06:13.538 --> 06:15.105
- The cards don't lie.
- Yeah?

06:15.107 --> 06:17.207
- Well, neither does this!
- Oh, yeah?

06:22.781 --> 06:25.214
Hey, there he is.
How goes it, Stew?

06:25.216 --> 06:28.084
Hey, you want a dumpling
and broth at the same time,

06:28.086 --> 06:29.219
what do you do?

06:29.221 --> 06:32.087
Uh... use a spoon?

06:32.089 --> 06:35.192
Not anymore.
Introducing chopstraws.

06:35.194 --> 06:37.461
Check this out.

06:41.466 --> 06:43.098
You've done it again,
buddy.

06:43.100 --> 06:44.700
Only $19.99, Hank.

06:44.702 --> 06:48.573
Order now, and I'll
throw in a scratchula!

06:50.742 --> 06:52.476
Ohh...

06:53.579 --> 06:54.547
Later, Stew.

06:55.581 --> 06:56.712
Oh, yeah.

06:56.714 --> 06:58.014
Get in there deeper,
come on.

06:58.016 --> 06:59.082
Uh-huh.

06:59.084 --> 07:00.950
Uhh!
Oh, yeah.

07:00.952 --> 07:04.253
- Morning, Yakov.
- Da.

07:04.255 --> 07:05.755
Henchmen,
at ready!

07:05.757 --> 07:06.889
Take aim.

07:06.891 --> 07:07.860
Fire!

07:09.961 --> 07:11.827
Fire!

07:11.829 --> 07:14.598
All right.
Check this out!

07:19.170 --> 07:21.238
What's shakin',
old timer?

07:21.240 --> 07:23.507
Old Doug?
Old Doug!

07:23.509 --> 07:26.709
Ahh! No, I don't want to
take a 15 minute survey.

07:26.711 --> 07:28.512
Ow!
Give me that.

07:28.514 --> 07:30.579
Oh, boss, it's you.

07:30.581 --> 07:31.748
Can I have five bucks?

07:31.750 --> 07:33.250
You can stay sharp.

07:33.252 --> 07:34.985
Listen, it's dangerous
around here. Okay?

07:34.987 --> 07:38.288
You got it, boss.
Right after my break.

07:38.290 --> 07:40.890
Which starts right...

07:40.892 --> 07:43.627
Morning, Hank.

07:43.629 --> 07:44.728
- Pew!
- Huh?

07:44.730 --> 07:47.029
Pew, pew, pew! Pew!
Laser!

07:47.031 --> 07:48.632
What do we have here?

07:48.634 --> 07:52.067
Kneel before the awesome power
of The Orphan!

07:52.069 --> 07:54.803
Oh, no, everybody run!

07:54.805 --> 07:56.639
Pew, pew, pew.
Yeah!

07:56.641 --> 07:57.873
- Hey!
- Huh?

07:59.177 --> 08:01.211
- What are you doing?
- Who cut the cheese?

08:01.213 --> 08:02.812
I'm so sorry.
I... I was just...

08:02.814 --> 08:05.281
Trying to kill me?
Yeah, I noticed.

08:05.283 --> 08:08.151
Wait a minute.
Why aren't you in uniform?

08:08.153 --> 08:09.885
Oh, uh, it's my birthday.

08:09.887 --> 08:11.187
Not what I asked.

08:11.189 --> 08:13.957
How and why are you in
the Gluttonator's lair?

08:13.959 --> 08:16.194
Oh, I'm Lester.
I'm here to sign up.

08:17.629 --> 08:19.899
Ah. You fell for it,
too, huh?

08:22.033 --> 08:23.632
Hey, what's this?

08:23.634 --> 08:26.101
Oh, um, that's my
supervillain persona,

08:26.103 --> 08:28.574
The Orphan.

08:29.307 --> 08:31.240
Okay.

08:31.242 --> 08:33.309
Do you know
how many Henchmen

08:33.312 --> 08:35.645
have actually become
supervillains?

08:35.647 --> 08:36.979
Seventeen. Why?

08:36.981 --> 08:38.914
All right, listen.
It's dead simple.

08:38.917 --> 08:40.349
- Okay.
- Go back to the elevator,

08:40.351 --> 08:41.784
take it up to
the ground floor.

08:41.787 --> 08:43.652
- All right.
- Start walking east.

08:43.654 --> 08:45.188
Keep going 'til you hit
Apex City.

08:45.190 --> 08:47.223
- Get a boring job.
- What?

08:47.225 --> 08:48.791
Get married,
have a kid,

08:48.793 --> 08:50.826
grow old, die peacefully
in your sleep.

08:50.828 --> 08:51.861
- But I...
- Got it?

08:51.863 --> 08:53.796
No! Sir.

08:53.798 --> 08:55.799
This is my dream.

08:55.801 --> 08:57.099
Dream?

08:57.101 --> 08:59.868
Take a look, kid.
This is a nightmare.

08:59.870 --> 09:02.071
But that's a real
supervillain.

09:02.073 --> 09:03.205
Hey, don't be shy.

09:03.207 --> 09:05.108
Get in on these
mashed potatoes.

09:05.110 --> 09:07.009
Oh, this is so exciting!

09:07.011 --> 09:08.344
He's attacking the world

09:08.346 --> 09:10.280
with radioactive cheese.

09:10.282 --> 09:11.848
It's stupid.
It's not exciting.

09:13.250 --> 09:15.685
- What's happening?
- And here we go again.

09:17.389 --> 09:19.222
What the Feta?!

09:19.224 --> 09:20.623
It's over, Gluttonator.

09:20.625 --> 09:22.858
The Friendly Force Five
are here.

09:22.860 --> 09:24.026
Six!

09:24.028 --> 09:25.695
Friendly Force Six!

09:27.032 --> 09:29.999
- Oh!
- They call me the Jackalope.

09:30.001 --> 09:31.233
Great.

09:31.235 --> 09:32.736
What is he doing here?

09:32.738 --> 09:34.304
I'm sorry,
he's my half brother.

09:34.306 --> 09:35.704
But he's not one of us.

09:35.706 --> 09:37.406
Yeah, you try
telling my mom that.

09:38.909 --> 09:40.276
Gluttonator army...

09:40.278 --> 09:41.276
Attack!

09:49.788 --> 09:52.055
Ha-ha! You missed.

09:52.057 --> 09:53.125
Eesh.

09:56.260 --> 09:57.993
Oh, no.

09:57.995 --> 10:00.063
Hey, boys.

10:00.065 --> 10:01.998
The Pep Girl Twins! Run!

10:03.735 --> 10:05.001
Hi-ya!

10:06.738 --> 10:08.304
Holy moly!

10:08.306 --> 10:10.172
Let's do this!

10:10.174 --> 10:13.743
Anyone hungry?
I brought smacks.

10:13.745 --> 10:14.911
Freeze, Slap Happy!

10:14.913 --> 10:16.412
And now I spin!

10:17.448 --> 10:19.416
<i>Ole!</i>

10:21.153 --> 10:22.919
Mozzarella!

10:22.921 --> 10:24.688
Hello.

10:26.424 --> 10:28.226
Dodge this,
Nick of Time.

10:29.326 --> 10:30.959
Ha-ha!

10:30.961 --> 10:33.296
Ooh, so close.

10:35.033 --> 10:38.300
Feel my rapid
super rabbit kick!

10:38.302 --> 10:40.103
How is he my brother?

10:40.105 --> 10:42.772
Oh! I believe this is yours.

10:42.774 --> 10:43.906
Well, think fast.

10:45.711 --> 10:47.776
Okay, show's over, kid.

10:47.778 --> 10:50.379
- Help!
- Old Doug!

10:50.381 --> 10:52.916
Told you to stay sharp.

10:52.918 --> 10:54.316
Boss, please.

10:54.318 --> 10:56.352
This ain't my first rodeo.

10:56.354 --> 10:58.320
Wait. Is this a rodeo?

10:58.322 --> 11:00.723
- Ahh!
- Let's get outta here!

11:00.725 --> 11:02.791
- Hey, guys!
- Huh? Hank!

11:02.793 --> 11:04.460
Oh, you're kiddin' me. That's
the fifth time this month.

11:04.462 --> 11:06.061
How is that even possible?

11:06.063 --> 11:08.330
- Time for my sponge bath.
- Let's get him out of here.

11:09.366 --> 11:11.133
Oh, for the love of brie!

11:11.135 --> 11:13.469
We're gettin' our
asiago's kicked.

11:13.471 --> 11:15.805
I'll be back.

11:17.075 --> 11:18.474
Camembert!

11:22.114 --> 11:25.748
Woohoo!
Come and get some!

11:28.519 --> 11:29.953
Ohh!

11:29.955 --> 11:31.353
Hey, I just got
the bunny guy!

11:31.355 --> 11:32.955
Do I get promoted?

11:32.957 --> 11:35.224
Sure, kid, I'll promote you.

11:35.226 --> 11:37.426
All the way upstairs.

11:37.428 --> 11:38.994
Uh...

11:38.996 --> 11:40.964
But I just shot you.

11:40.966 --> 11:42.297
I'm a super hero.

11:42.299 --> 11:46.969
And we don't get killed
so eas...

11:49.441 --> 11:51.406
Whoa!
You just saved my life.

11:51.408 --> 11:53.175
Yeah.
Happy birthday, kid.

11:53.177 --> 11:55.377
Now, get outta here,
and go and have a great,

11:55.379 --> 11:59.118
normal, super boring life.

12:01.986 --> 12:04.286
<i>Nowhere to go?</i>

12:04.288 --> 12:06.289
<i>Well, look no further.</i>

12:06.291 --> 12:09.158
<i>The Union of Evil Henchmen

12:17.134 --> 12:18.535
<i>Are you good at being bad?</i>

12:18.537 --> 12:20.270
<i>Bad at being good?</i>

12:20.272 --> 12:21.271
- I am.
- I am.

12:21.273 --> 12:22.274
I am.

12:25.811 --> 12:27.544
<i>We meet death in the face

12:27.546 --> 12:29.278

12:32.350 --> 12:34.283
Punch death in the face!

12:34.285 --> 12:35.450
<i>We don't just die,</i>

12:35.452 --> 12:36.920
<i>we die hard.</i>

12:36.922 --> 12:38.454
Great movie!

12:45.297 --> 12:47.063
<i>Certain strings
may be attached.</i>

12:47.065 --> 12:50.900
<i>Because we're bad,

<i>Welcome to

13:07.918 --> 13:10.389
<i>Please hold the handrail
while exiting the vehicle.</i>

13:11.923 --> 13:14.523
- Attention recruit.
- Yes, sir!

13:14.525 --> 13:17.526
Time to find out what type
of henchman you are.

13:17.528 --> 13:19.195
Are you a level one?

13:19.197 --> 13:21.330
The elite right hand
of super evil?

13:21.332 --> 13:22.498
Yes, I am.

13:22.500 --> 13:24.467
Uh, what's that?

13:24.469 --> 13:26.502
Scanning, scanning,

13:26.504 --> 13:28.503
scanning.

13:28.505 --> 13:31.074
- Not even close.
- Oh...

13:31.076 --> 13:33.075
Perhaps you have
the killer instinct

13:33.077 --> 13:35.143
of a henchman second class,

13:35.145 --> 13:37.412
foot soldiers of darkness.

13:37.414 --> 13:38.480
Huh?

13:38.482 --> 13:41.117
Wow, cool.

13:41.119 --> 13:43.355
- Bring the pain.
- Hey!

13:45.956 --> 13:47.522
Huh?

13:47.524 --> 13:49.092
Friendly Force!

13:49.094 --> 13:50.627
<i>Drop your weapon,
evil scout!</i>

13:50.629 --> 13:53.095
Take this!

13:53.097 --> 13:54.664
My gun's broken!

13:54.666 --> 13:57.099
No, no, no, no, no!

13:59.169 --> 14:02.238
Ouch.
New height record.

14:03.441 --> 14:05.407
It's all happening
so fast.

14:05.409 --> 14:07.643
- And we're done.
- Already?

14:07.645 --> 14:09.912
But can't I just...

14:09.914 --> 14:11.314
What's that for?

14:11.316 --> 14:14.150
Henchman class three it is.
What a shocker.

14:14.152 --> 14:15.450
Really? Ow!

14:15.452 --> 14:16.652
Bye-bye.

14:16.654 --> 14:19.055
Next.

14:19.057 --> 14:21.456
<i>Would the
owner of the red murder tank</i>

14:21.458 --> 14:22.994
<i>please move your vehicle.</i>

14:24.528 --> 14:25.695
Take a seat, Hank.

14:25.697 --> 14:28.263
Let's review.

14:28.265 --> 14:30.065
Hey, look, it's you.

14:30.067 --> 14:31.600
Oh, boy.

14:31.602 --> 14:34.570
<i>I'm a super hero,
and we don't get killed</i>

14:34.572 --> 14:37.172
<i>so eas...</i>

14:39.210 --> 14:40.575
And there's
the Gluttonator.

14:42.013 --> 14:44.147
Nice one.

14:44.149 --> 14:46.581
Listen, boss,
I was just helping that kid.

14:46.583 --> 14:49.319
Heroic stuff,
to be sure,

14:49.321 --> 14:51.353
but here's the thing.

14:51.355 --> 14:53.555
We work for the bad guys.

14:56.027 --> 14:57.897
So what's it gonna be
this time?

14:58.964 --> 15:00.162
Huh?

15:00.164 --> 15:02.699
Meet your apprentice.

15:02.701 --> 15:03.699
What the...

15:03.701 --> 15:05.701
Oh!

15:07.105 --> 15:08.503
Hey!

15:08.505 --> 15:09.705
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

15:09.707 --> 15:11.473
No. No, no, no.
No way!

15:11.475 --> 15:13.709
Hi! My name's Le...

15:13.711 --> 15:16.713
Oh! Motion sickness.

15:18.716 --> 15:20.215
Whoa,
that's a lot of vomit.

15:20.217 --> 15:21.584
Ahh.

15:23.254 --> 15:26.254
Lester Fauntleroy Lederhosen
reporting for duty.

15:26.256 --> 15:29.092
- Come on, boss, please.
- Get out of my office, Hank.

15:29.094 --> 15:30.593
Oh, and don't forget.

15:30.595 --> 15:32.594
You're on your third strike.

15:32.596 --> 15:33.628
Oh, I got it.

15:33.630 --> 15:36.199
Uh, sorry about the barf.

15:36.201 --> 15:38.233
- Kid!
- Oh! Uh, sorry.

15:38.235 --> 15:40.605
Uh-oh. Bye.

15:43.107 --> 15:45.108
Pete, you are good.

15:46.378 --> 15:48.643
Get a cleaning bot
in here, pronto.

15:48.645 --> 15:52.214
Oh, man. I can't believe
that you are my mentor.

15:52.216 --> 15:54.349
- Yeah, neither can I.
- Oh, thanks.

15:54.351 --> 15:57.286
Ow! You kinda got me there.

15:57.288 --> 15:59.555
I mean, yesterday
I was at the orphanage.

15:59.557 --> 16:04.430
And today I'm here.
You gotta be kidding me.

16:06.364 --> 16:08.233
Supervillain City!

16:10.769 --> 16:13.770
- Kid?
- Oh, I'm coming.

16:15.706 --> 16:18.541
So let me get this straight.

16:18.543 --> 16:21.143
I get to live here forever?

16:21.145 --> 16:24.647
- 3.6 months, kid.
- What's that? Whoa!

16:24.649 --> 16:27.682
That is the average life
expectancy of a henchmen trainee.

16:27.684 --> 16:30.286
Oh, man.

16:30.288 --> 16:34.156
Is that who I think it is?

16:34.158 --> 16:36.526
Were you kicked by a horse
at some point?

16:36.528 --> 16:38.730
It's the Nemisisters!

16:40.532 --> 16:42.531
Working in a bakery?

16:42.533 --> 16:46.134
Yeah, supervillains don't tend
to save a lot for retirement.

16:46.136 --> 16:48.403
- Oh. Hey, can we get a...
- Nope.

16:48.405 --> 16:49.407
Aw.

16:52.677 --> 16:55.411
- Wow! Comics!
- Newspapers here, kid.

16:55.413 --> 16:58.180
- What?
- Chronicles of disaster.

16:58.182 --> 17:01.153
Oh, no way!
I love comics. Huh?

17:03.822 --> 17:05.688
Ho-ho!
Yoink.

17:05.690 --> 17:08.723
Hey, hey!
We got one rule here, kid.

17:08.726 --> 17:10.226
No crime.

17:10.228 --> 17:12.561
But this
is Supervillain City.

17:12.564 --> 17:14.630
Exactly.
Without that rule,

17:14.632 --> 17:17.432
how long you think
this place would last?

17:17.434 --> 17:19.768
Hmm. Makes sense.

17:19.770 --> 17:21.703
- Hey there, sucker.
- Hello.

17:21.704 --> 17:23.573
- You ever get shot in the keister?
- No.

17:23.575 --> 17:26.342
- Well, I got a deal on bulletproof underpants.
- Really?

17:26.344 --> 17:28.577
- Wanna blow up the planet?
- Maybe.

17:28.579 --> 17:31.847
Of course, you do. Doesn't mean
you have to blow up your savings.

17:31.849 --> 17:35.317
Two-for-one nukes at Discount
Desmond's Bomb-O-Rama!

17:35.319 --> 17:37.186
Hey, I saw him first,
sweetheart!

17:37.188 --> 17:39.388
Well, get lost, buddy,
because this is my corner.

17:39.390 --> 17:41.724
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Leave him alone, would ya?

17:41.726 --> 17:45.361
He's a Class 3 trainee.
He's got no evil plans.

17:45.363 --> 17:46.728
Or money.

17:46.730 --> 17:48.463
Hey, wait! Come back!

17:48.465 --> 17:49.899
I totally have evil plans.

17:49.901 --> 17:52.468
Great, kid.
Now let's go find us a job.

17:52.470 --> 17:54.202
- Ow.
- If we can.

17:54.204 --> 17:56.873
Henchman today,
supervillain tomorrow.

17:56.875 --> 17:58.641
Hey, what's that!

17:58.643 --> 18:01.510
That is the henchmen job fair.

18:01.512 --> 18:03.880
Wow!

18:03.882 --> 18:06.748
Hey! Free water wings
when you sign up with Tsunami.

18:06.750 --> 18:09.620
Oh, come on! I'll throw in
a pair of flood pants.

18:11.155 --> 18:12.787
No way!

18:12.789 --> 18:14.422
It's Shark Hands!

18:14.424 --> 18:16.258
And Twisted Squidster!

18:16.260 --> 18:17.793
I get to choose
who I work for?

18:17.795 --> 18:21.229
Ah, no. I get to choose
who we work for.

18:21.231 --> 18:23.298
How 'bout Dr. Manbaby?

18:23.300 --> 18:24.799
- See that diaper.
- Yeah.

18:24.801 --> 18:27.170
- Not just a costume.
- Oh, cool.

18:27.172 --> 18:28.804
Oh, wait. No. Eww.

18:28.806 --> 18:30.940
- Heads up!
- Old Doug?

18:30.942 --> 18:33.543
- Hey, boss.
- What happened?

18:33.545 --> 18:35.644
I don't know.
You just got here.

18:35.646 --> 18:38.180
- Where's your body?
- He went surfing with Dr. Shark Hands.

18:38.182 --> 18:41.551
Yeah, that dude
has serious rage issues.

18:41.553 --> 18:44.786
Now, I'm a spaceship.

18:44.788 --> 18:48.257
Kid, meet the crew. You met Old Doug.
This is Jane.

18:48.259 --> 18:50.459
Hello there, peach fuzz.

18:50.461 --> 18:51.661
- Stew.
- Hey.

18:51.663 --> 18:53.930
- And Yakov.
- Da.

18:53.932 --> 18:55.664
Great to meet you guys.

18:55.666 --> 18:56.832
So who we working for
this time, boss?

18:56.834 --> 18:58.668
Huh?

18:58.670 --> 19:01.403
- <i>♪ Baron ♪</i>
- Whoa!

19:01.405 --> 19:07.410
<i>♪ Blackout ♪</i>

19:07.412 --> 19:10.546
<i>♪ Yeah ♪</i>

19:10.548 --> 19:15.418
<i>♪ Baron ♪</i>

19:15.420 --> 19:17.286
The Baron?

19:17.288 --> 19:20.555
<i>♪ Baron Blackout ♪</i>

19:20.557 --> 19:23.859
Henchmen,
come forth and join me,

19:23.861 --> 19:26.562
the last name in super evil.

19:26.564 --> 19:29.701
<i>♪ Baron Blackout ♪</i>

19:31.868 --> 19:34.836
Is this thing on?

19:34.838 --> 19:37.873
Oh, forget it. Did I mention
I'm paying triple?

19:39.644 --> 19:42.378
- Whoo!
- Sign me up!

19:42.380 --> 19:46.315
- Triple wages?
- Uh, yes, please.

19:46.317 --> 19:48.017
Ah! Easy, guys.
Remember Hank's Henchmen

19:48.019 --> 19:49.719
Survival Rule Number Three?

19:49.721 --> 19:51.453
Oh, really?

19:51.455 --> 19:53.889
We never work
for Baron Blackout.

19:53.891 --> 19:55.324
But triple pay, man!

19:55.326 --> 19:57.325
And Rule Number Two.

19:57.327 --> 19:59.461
It's triple pay!

19:59.463 --> 20:01.998
I got bills, Hank. How am I
gonna pay for my eye cream?

20:02.000 --> 20:05.468
That stuff is from Germany.
It's gotta be imported.

20:05.470 --> 20:08.536
Who's ready to get paid?
Am I right?

20:09.807 --> 20:11.507
You are!
I know you are, Dwayne!

20:11.509 --> 20:13.042
I see you looking at me.

20:13.044 --> 20:15.378
Come on! Get up here!

20:15.380 --> 20:19.748
My number-one rule:
we never work with Biff.

20:19.750 --> 20:22.684
Get up here.

20:22.686 --> 20:25.888
Well, well, well...

20:25.890 --> 20:27.657
Hank "Chore-again."

20:27.659 --> 20:31.360
Just read about that sweet move
you pulled on the Gluttonator.

20:31.362 --> 20:33.696
- Get lost, Biff.
- Why don't you make me?

20:33.698 --> 20:34.930
Janitor.

20:34.932 --> 20:36.966
Well, since you asked
so nice...

20:36.968 --> 20:39.934
You wanna fight him, you're
gonna have to get through me...

20:39.936 --> 20:41.937
first.
Oh, you're big.

20:41.939 --> 20:44.306
Oh, who's this little squirt?

20:44.308 --> 20:46.374
- I'm...
- Oh, wait. I don't care.

20:46.376 --> 20:48.076
Ow.

20:48.078 --> 20:51.782
Later, mob jockeys.
High-pay duty calls!

20:54.818 --> 20:56.686
Well, so much for that job.

20:56.688 --> 20:58.586
Forget that ding-a-ling.

20:58.588 --> 21:00.789
Guys, we'll catch up
with you later.

21:00.791 --> 21:04.326
Kid, let's start you off
with something easy.

21:04.328 --> 21:07.732
The Supervillain
History Museum?

21:09.433 --> 21:12.000
Oh, man, I bet you
come here all the time.

21:12.002 --> 21:13.938
Never, kid.
Not really my thing.

21:15.440 --> 21:18.574
Whoa...

21:20.545 --> 21:22.611
Look how big is!

21:22.613 --> 21:25.081
- Best birthday ever!
- Hey!

21:26.683 --> 21:30.119
The Oozinator!
Gross in the best way.

21:30.121 --> 21:32.888
Oh! The Aquabot!

21:32.890 --> 21:35.824
- Hey, kid.
- No way!

21:35.826 --> 21:38.297
It's the Ray of Absurd Fears.

21:39.830 --> 21:41.697
Platypus! Leg warmers!

21:41.699 --> 21:43.732
Soup!

21:43.734 --> 21:46.568
So, how 'bout we get started...

21:46.570 --> 21:47.836
And there he goes.

21:47.838 --> 21:50.041
Oh! A big thing covered
in a sheet!

21:51.642 --> 21:55.577
Whoa! This is
the Time Bandit, Hank.

21:55.579 --> 21:57.613
Looks a lot more "was"
than "is."

21:57.615 --> 22:00.449
The Supers dropped
a volcano on it,

22:00.451 --> 22:03.719
sealing him
in this giant diamond tomb.

22:03.721 --> 22:04.987
Superheroes.

22:04.989 --> 22:06.756
Always with the overkill.

22:06.758 --> 22:08.123
No. They were scared.

22:08.125 --> 22:11.861
That glowing orb there,
that's whatifium.

22:11.863 --> 22:15.730
Hmm. Now, where did I put
my "dontcarium"?

22:15.732 --> 22:17.165
I don't think you understand,
Hank.

22:17.167 --> 22:18.734
You break that thing open,

22:18.736 --> 22:21.473
and it makes all
your dreams come true.

22:22.740 --> 22:24.873
That sounds great,
but listen up.

22:24.875 --> 22:26.609
There's no magic time bomb.

22:26.611 --> 22:28.943
So get a grip, kid...

22:28.945 --> 22:30.645
on this mop.

22:30.647 --> 22:33.017
All right.
You got it, boss.

22:35.486 --> 22:37.152
Oh, hey.

22:37.154 --> 22:38.754
Watch it. Oh.

22:38.756 --> 22:41.190
Sorry.
I was reading and walking.

22:41.192 --> 22:44.559
Here, let me help you.

22:44.561 --> 22:47.630
- Thanks.
- Wait.

22:47.632 --> 22:49.198
- Don't I know you?
- Ugh.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.966
- That's original.
- No.

22:50.968 --> 22:52.168
You were a scientist
for Baron Blackout,

22:52.170 --> 22:53.768
and I was...

22:53.770 --> 22:54.903
The henchman who saved
those kids.

22:54.905 --> 22:57.773
- Yeah.
- Wait.

22:57.775 --> 23:00.709
- When did you...
- Get demoted to mop jockey?

23:00.711 --> 23:03.045
About one hour after
we last saw each other.

23:03.047 --> 23:04.779
- Seriously?
- Yeah, well...

23:04.781 --> 23:07.516
I'm Hank... Hank Corrigan.

23:07.518 --> 23:10.084
Jolene... Zen.

23:10.086 --> 23:12.587
- Museum curator.
- Yeah.

23:12.589 --> 23:16.659
All the cool gadgets
with none of the crazy bosses.

23:16.661 --> 23:18.059
Oh, that sounds great.

23:19.963 --> 23:21.063
Oh, no.

23:21.065 --> 23:22.998
- Hey!
- Really, kid?

23:23.000 --> 23:27.670
- What are you doing?
- I barely touched it.

23:27.672 --> 23:30.672
I just restored this.

23:30.674 --> 23:33.209
I'm sorry.

23:33.211 --> 23:37.479
Uh, hi. My name is Laura...
I mean Larry... Lester.

23:39.083 --> 23:41.883
Yeah, he's fresh
off the hover bus

23:41.885 --> 23:44.085
and a little too excited
about all things evil.

23:44.087 --> 23:47.088
It's all right.
Just be careful.

23:47.090 --> 23:49.158
I'll keep him on a short leash.

23:49.160 --> 23:50.825
So, hey, what are you
doing later?

23:50.827 --> 23:53.728
I was thinking maybe,
I don't know, we could...

23:53.730 --> 23:56.231
Oh, sorry. I have to take this.

23:56.233 --> 23:59.901
Ooh, gotta run. Yeah.
Nice seeing you again, Hank.

23:59.903 --> 24:01.103
Yeah, nice...

24:01.105 --> 24:04.840
seeing you, too.

24:04.842 --> 24:06.574
Boy, is she pretty.

24:06.576 --> 24:08.244
All right, kid, fun's over.

24:08.246 --> 24:10.645
We got a lot of mopping to do.

24:10.647 --> 24:12.847
Hey, look!
She forgot her computer.

24:12.849 --> 24:14.650
Perfect!
Kid, I'll be right back.

24:14.652 --> 24:16.852
Don't move a muscle.

24:16.854 --> 24:18.722
Not a muscle.

24:20.290 --> 24:21.859
You got it, Hank.

24:24.060 --> 24:26.997
Not a muscle.

24:31.801 --> 24:34.169
Henchmen! Attention!

24:34.171 --> 24:36.005
Yes, sir!

24:36.007 --> 24:39.775
The time has finally come
to meet your master of menace,

24:39.777 --> 24:41.876
your titan of tyranny,

24:41.878 --> 24:45.146
and ultimate evil overlord!

24:45.148 --> 24:48.616
Henchmen, I give you...

24:48.618 --> 24:51.053
<i>♪ Baron Blackout ♪</i>

24:51.055 --> 24:52.921
Ha ha!

24:52.923 --> 24:57.159
Welcome, my obedient
and disposable horde.

24:57.161 --> 25:00.662
Join me on my quest
for global domination

25:00.664 --> 25:03.198
and outright devotion.

25:07.904 --> 25:08.903
Stop it!
Not now!

25:08.905 --> 25:09.939
No!

25:11.642 --> 25:14.176
Oh, I've had it.
I can't see. Biff!

25:14.178 --> 25:17.313
- Help me get this thing off.
- Of course, sir.

25:17.315 --> 25:18.980
- Come on, hurry up.
- Here we go.

25:18.982 --> 25:20.682
- Ah!
- That's it, that's it.

25:20.684 --> 25:22.918
- Now, easy. Easy.
- No. Hold still. Hold still.

25:22.920 --> 25:25.353
- I can't see!
- Don't do that. I got... I got it.

25:25.355 --> 25:26.988
Let me. Let me.

25:26.990 --> 25:28.724
Oh, come on.

25:32.997 --> 25:35.064
- Almost there!
- Oh! Do it now!

25:35.066 --> 25:36.699
- Almost...
- Do it now!

25:36.701 --> 25:39.668
Are you all right, Baron?

25:39.670 --> 25:41.970
Biff, you
lumbering buffoon.

25:41.972 --> 25:45.207
Why are there no
nose holes in this thing?

25:45.209 --> 25:47.809
I'm so sorry, sir. I'll have
some drilled right away.

25:47.811 --> 25:50.211
Forget it. No more mask.

25:50.213 --> 25:52.347
No more hiding.

25:52.349 --> 25:54.350
But, sir, the union of evil,

25:54.352 --> 25:58.219
they banned you
for when you fled.

25:58.221 --> 26:00.823
Fled! I did not flee.

26:00.825 --> 26:03.691
That was a strategic retreat.

26:03.693 --> 26:05.728
Brilliant, sir!

26:05.730 --> 26:07.395
A ten year retreat!

26:07.397 --> 26:09.864
- Shut your bulbous face.
- Yes, sir.

26:09.866 --> 26:11.232
Sorry, sir.

26:11.234 --> 26:13.869
Now, you there,
in the helmet.

26:13.871 --> 26:16.705
Uh, me?

26:16.707 --> 26:18.974
No, of course not, you.
Him!

26:18.976 --> 26:21.876
- Me?
- You're wearing a helmet, aren't you?

26:21.878 --> 26:23.045
Uh, yeah.

26:23.047 --> 26:24.246
Imbecile.

26:24.248 --> 26:25.250
Come forward.

26:27.050 --> 26:29.183
Stand over there by the wall.

26:29.185 --> 26:30.719
Uh, yes, sir.

26:30.721 --> 26:34.890
I have a few questions
for you on the subject...

26:37.862 --> 26:40.198
...of loyalty.

26:41.999 --> 26:45.066
Yeah! Come and get some!

26:45.068 --> 26:46.301
Pew! Pew! Pew!

26:46.303 --> 26:49.074
Oh, no way!

26:50.407 --> 26:53.875
I am Hell Hawk!
Super Screech Attack!

26:56.279 --> 26:58.180
Huh? Cool!

26:58.182 --> 27:02.918
Fear the mind-sucking gaze
of Brain Drain.

27:07.825 --> 27:10.191
How do you stop
this thing? Aah!

27:10.193 --> 27:12.026
No!

27:12.028 --> 27:13.828
Well, that
could have been worse.

27:13.830 --> 27:15.699
No, no, no, no!
Please stop! Oh!

27:18.169 --> 27:21.103
Huh? What's that?

27:21.105 --> 27:23.037
"Ubersuit Prototype."

27:23.039 --> 27:24.643
Whoa!

27:26.076 --> 27:29.944
Oh, man.
This is too cool.

27:29.946 --> 27:33.481

What's happening? Huh?

27:41.459 --> 27:43.257
Uh...

27:43.259 --> 27:47.228
Okay, how about
I take the helmet off

27:47.230 --> 27:49.363
and you go back in your box?

27:51.335 --> 27:53.401
Hey! Oh!

27:53.403 --> 27:55.103

Oh!

28:49.393 --> 28:52.126
So what do you think, Lou?

28:52.128 --> 28:54.429
I think there's
a new sheriff in town.

28:56.299 --> 28:57.298
Yo, check this out.

28:59.269 --> 29:01.269
Magnum A.I. on patrol!

29:01.271 --> 29:05.173
- Hey, you hear an alarm?
- Yeah, I do.

29:05.175 --> 29:07.441
Oooh! Maybe someone's
stealing things!

29:07.443 --> 29:09.411
Let's check the news.

29:09.413 --> 29:11.145
Terri will know
what's going on.

29:11.147 --> 29:12.881
She is very reputable.

29:12.883 --> 29:14.482
- Boom.
- <i>Good evening.</i>

29:14.484 --> 29:17.018
<i>I'm Terri Murphy, and this
is your Super News at 7.</i>

29:17.020 --> 29:19.421
All right!

29:19.423 --> 29:21.556
What do the Pressure Cooker,
Blast Radius,

29:21.558 --> 29:24.159
and Dr. Manbaby
all have in common?

29:24.161 --> 29:27.429
They were all defeated today
by the Friendly Force Five.

29:31.234 --> 29:34.369
Well, Captain Superior,
you sure had a busy day.

29:34.371 --> 29:37.038
Mmm, no, we were done
by noon.

29:37.040 --> 29:39.842
These evil fools got no game.

29:39.844 --> 29:41.476
Like, none.

29:41.478 --> 29:44.846
We could really use a challenge,
you know what I'm saying?

29:44.848 --> 29:47.216
Well, you may just get
your wish.

29:47.218 --> 29:48.449
This just in.

29:48.451 --> 29:50.451
A brand-new supervillain
is on the loose.

29:50.453 --> 29:53.188
In a matter of hours,
this unknown menace

29:53.190 --> 29:55.524
has caused more chaos
than most supervillains have

29:55.526 --> 29:57.226
in a lifetime.

29:57.228 --> 30:00.228
He's been seen
decimating birthday cakes,

30:00.230 --> 30:01.496
spawning tidal waves,

30:01.498 --> 30:03.865
and ravaging
the Apex City Zoo.

30:03.867 --> 30:06.067
Nobody is safe
from the mayhem.

30:06.069 --> 30:08.269
Not even Pop Pop.

30:08.271 --> 30:10.104
We may not know his name
or motives yet,

30:10.106 --> 30:12.140
but one thing is very clear.

30:12.142 --> 30:14.343
This guy means business.

30:18.015 --> 30:20.481
Today marked
the first Koala in space.

30:20.483 --> 30:22.250
The little one's name is Kiki,

30:22.252 --> 30:25.152
and she comes from the zoo
right here in Apex City.

30:25.154 --> 30:26.990
Good on ya, Kiki.

30:28.291 --> 30:30.558
So, you ready for action,
Captain Superior?

30:30.560 --> 30:33.161
Uh... Uh...
Listen, Carrie...

30:33.163 --> 30:34.997
- It's Terri.
- Whatever.

30:34.999 --> 30:36.265
Good thoughts,

30:36.267 --> 30:38.901
but we just saved
the entire world,

30:38.903 --> 30:41.236
like, again,
and we're kind of

30:41.238 --> 30:43.104
- eating right now.
- Hey, come on!

30:43.106 --> 30:45.039
- So...
- Give me my sandwich!

30:45.041 --> 30:46.574
Ahh!

30:50.446 --> 30:52.247
Where were you at 6 p.m.?

30:52.249 --> 30:54.516
I was at home
shaving my chest. I swear.

30:54.518 --> 30:56.153
Hmm, very smooth.

30:58.188 --> 31:00.291
So much for laying low.

31:02.992 --> 31:05.393
I could run.

31:05.395 --> 31:07.328
Oh, it'll just
make me look guilty.

31:07.330 --> 31:09.998
Why'd I even become
a henchman?

31:10.000 --> 31:11.699
I should build
a time machine.

31:13.403 --> 31:16.404
Or better yet,
I could use...

31:16.406 --> 31:18.440
What-if-ium!

31:18.442 --> 31:20.676
Get real, Hank.

31:20.678 --> 31:22.544
Well, I guess the kid got
exactly what he wanted.

31:24.580 --> 31:26.448
Clearly, he wasn't
the bumbling newb

31:26.450 --> 31:27.552
he pretended to be.

31:29.553 --> 31:32.955
I think he was
a cold, calculating

31:32.957 --> 31:35.056
criminal mastermind.

31:35.058 --> 31:36.959
Help me!

31:39.696 --> 31:42.197
Well, Hank,
look on the bright side.

31:42.199 --> 31:44.199
At least you
got rid of him. Huh?

31:44.201 --> 31:46.168
Huh?

31:46.170 --> 31:48.473
What?

31:57.748 --> 31:59.347
Okay. All right.
You got me.

31:59.349 --> 32:00.317
I give up.

32:04.454 --> 32:05.720
- Help.
- Huh?

32:10.626 --> 32:12.259
Oh, my head.

32:12.261 --> 32:13.628
Kid?

32:13.630 --> 32:17.599
Hank? Oh, man,
I am so glad to see you.

32:17.601 --> 32:19.401
Hey, hey.
Hey! Get off me!

32:19.403 --> 32:20.602
Oh! Oh, sorry.

32:20.604 --> 32:22.336
You just destroyed
my apartment.

32:22.338 --> 32:24.238
What? No, I didn't. I...

32:24.240 --> 32:27.476
Oh. Yes. I did.

32:27.478 --> 32:29.745
Wait a second.
You've never been here.

32:29.747 --> 32:31.145
How did you find me?

32:31.147 --> 32:32.213
I didn't.

32:32.215 --> 32:34.115
I think <i>it</i> did.

32:34.117 --> 32:36.418
Look, whatever your
ridiculous plan is,

32:36.420 --> 32:37.486
I want no part of it.

32:37.488 --> 32:38.786
Plan?

32:38.788 --> 32:41.489
You think
I stole this thing?

32:41.491 --> 32:43.758
You just smashed through
my wall wearing it.

32:43.760 --> 32:45.794
Yeah, but... that's
not what happened.

32:45.796 --> 32:47.629
Sure, I tried the helmet on,

32:47.631 --> 32:49.765
but then the suit
just grabbed me.

32:49.767 --> 32:52.401
Look, kid, you want to be
a supervillain,

32:52.403 --> 32:53.434
you're on your own.

32:53.436 --> 32:55.303
I can't do this alone.

32:55.305 --> 32:56.671
I need your help.

32:56.673 --> 32:58.239
You're my mentor.

32:58.241 --> 32:59.507
Not anymore.

32:59.509 --> 33:01.043
What am I supposed to do?

33:01.045 --> 33:03.545
- Figure it out!
- I told you I can't!

33:03.547 --> 33:04.645
Kid... Whoa!

33:07.284 --> 33:09.551
Ah! Oh, no!
I am so sorry, Hank.

33:09.553 --> 33:11.119
Are you hurt?
I didn't mean to...

33:11.121 --> 33:12.153
I can't control this thing.

33:12.155 --> 33:13.521
- Whoa.
- Ah! Help me!

33:13.523 --> 33:14.789
Okay, hold on.

33:16.660 --> 33:20.128
Uh... Open the visor.

33:20.130 --> 33:22.463
Open the visor?
I can't!

33:22.465 --> 33:23.532
Oh...

33:23.534 --> 33:25.801
- What now?
- Sorry, kid.

33:25.803 --> 33:27.134
Why?

33:27.136 --> 33:28.138
Ahh!

33:32.809 --> 33:35.209
Not to worry.
Almost done.

33:35.211 --> 33:36.812
Just one more question.

33:36.814 --> 33:38.180
Uh, yes, sir?

33:38.182 --> 33:41.349
Which is your
favorite... nut?

33:41.351 --> 33:43.351
Oh, uh...

33:43.353 --> 33:44.553
Favorite, sir?

33:44.555 --> 33:49.190
Yes. Almond? Filbert?
Brazil?

33:49.192 --> 33:51.426
Oh. Macadamia. Sir.

33:51.428 --> 33:52.827
Right, then.

33:52.829 --> 33:55.729
So, when you find yourself
at a communal nut bowl,

33:55.731 --> 33:57.632
do you take a polite handful,

33:57.634 --> 34:01.569
or do you pick out just
your beloved Macadamia?

34:01.571 --> 34:04.605
Oh, uh, I guess
it depends, sir.

34:04.607 --> 34:06.574
Does it?

34:10.179 --> 34:13.581
Baron Blackout.

34:13.583 --> 34:14.882
Nuts to you.

34:14.885 --> 34:17.251
Get it?
See what I did there?

34:17.253 --> 34:18.452
Next!

34:18.454 --> 34:21.322
- Uh, Baron...
- I said next.

34:21.324 --> 34:22.623
Well, that was
the last one, sir.

34:22.626 --> 34:24.757
What are you talking about?

34:24.760 --> 34:27.262
Oh, how is this possible?

34:27.264 --> 34:30.231
Uh, well, you
blacked 'em all out, Baron.

34:30.233 --> 34:31.369
- Look.
- Huh?

34:33.469 --> 34:35.768
Well, at
least now they can be trusted.

34:35.771 --> 34:38.773
- Is my ship ready?
- Uh, no, sir.

34:42.346 --> 34:45.780
And what, pray tell, is
your sorry excuse this time?

34:45.782 --> 34:48.483
These things.
They're useless.

34:48.485 --> 34:50.518
Man, come on.

34:50.521 --> 34:52.353
Baron Blackout.

34:52.356 --> 34:54.523
- Well, do it without them.
- Not possible, sir.

34:54.525 --> 34:56.291
We do need
some henchmen.

34:56.293 --> 34:59.260
- Brutus, help me!
- Oh, nasty.

34:59.262 --> 35:01.229
Fine.
Then get more.

35:01.231 --> 35:02.796
Of course, sir,
but, uh,

35:02.798 --> 35:04.932
what do I say if
the Union has questions?

35:04.934 --> 35:06.400
Leave it to me, Biff.

35:06.402 --> 35:09.570
I'll put their worries
to rest.

35:13.242 --> 35:14.842
Ah! Get it off me!

35:14.844 --> 35:16.379
Biff!

35:21.518 --> 35:22.784
Hello?

35:22.786 --> 35:25.653
Yes, I know.
It's very bad, sir.

35:26.789 --> 35:28.289
Who stole it?
Ow!

35:28.291 --> 35:30.925
No idea. Ah!

35:30.927 --> 35:32.827
But this is
Supervillain City,

35:32.829 --> 35:34.729
so plenty of suspects.

35:34.731 --> 35:36.664
<i>Then figure it out!</i>

35:36.666 --> 35:39.336
Always a pleasure, sir.

35:43.273 --> 35:45.543
What now?

35:48.445 --> 35:50.412
Hello? Who's there?

35:50.414 --> 35:53.280
- Jolene?
- Hank?

35:53.282 --> 35:54.983
What are you...
doing here?

35:54.985 --> 35:57.351
Yeah, uh, I was in
the neighborhood,

35:57.353 --> 35:58.954
so thought I'd pop by.

35:58.956 --> 36:00.487
Pop by?

36:00.489 --> 36:02.824
Wow. How did you get
such a great place?

36:02.826 --> 36:04.291
I bought it.

36:04.293 --> 36:05.693
What is that?

36:05.695 --> 36:09.831
Uh... you know that thing
that happened at the museum?

36:09.833 --> 36:11.333
Yes, of course I do.

36:11.335 --> 36:14.438
Okay, well,
I really need a favor.

36:15.871 --> 36:17.706
You?

36:17.708 --> 36:19.374
You stole it?

36:19.376 --> 36:21.309
Me? No, it was the kid.

36:21.311 --> 36:23.010
Look, I wasn't even there.

36:23.012 --> 36:25.447
Yes, you were, Hank.
I talked to you.

36:25.449 --> 36:28.717
Yeah, but...
Here.

36:28.719 --> 36:31.318
I came looking for you,
and when I got back,

36:31.320 --> 36:32.920
- the museum was...
- Destroyed?

36:32.922 --> 36:34.389
Yeah, I noticed.

36:34.391 --> 36:36.891
Do you have any idea
how bad this is?

36:36.893 --> 36:38.860
Yes, I do.

36:41.931 --> 36:44.865
Can you help us?

36:44.867 --> 36:47.269
So who did
this suit belong to?

36:47.271 --> 36:49.470
A villain named
Endgame.

36:49.472 --> 36:50.639
Well, how did he
get out of it?

36:50.641 --> 36:51.805
Well...

36:51.807 --> 36:54.376
- With a hose.
- What?

36:54.378 --> 36:55.909
He slammed straight into
a mountain

36:55.911 --> 36:58.813
the first time he used it.

36:58.815 --> 37:01.416
Oh, man.

37:03.420 --> 37:04.885
Huh?

37:04.887 --> 37:05.954
I can't move my arms.

37:05.956 --> 37:07.554
- I...
- Easy kid.

37:07.556 --> 37:08.657
She's just trying to help.

37:08.659 --> 37:09.891
You get away from me!

37:09.893 --> 37:11.358
Visor down.
Visor down!

37:11.360 --> 37:13.561
Get back.
You're scaring him.

37:13.563 --> 37:15.496
Lester, no. No!

37:15.498 --> 37:16.764
Great.

37:19.503 --> 37:20.805
Lester, stop!

37:30.847 --> 37:31.945
Help me.
Help me!

37:31.947 --> 37:33.447
Punch him in the face!

37:33.449 --> 37:35.050
Ah! No punching.
No punching!

37:35.052 --> 37:36.918
Ohh! Ahh!

37:36.920 --> 37:39.320
Oh, no!

37:39.322 --> 37:41.055
No one is going to hurt you.

37:41.057 --> 37:42.389
You have to calm down.

37:42.391 --> 37:44.092
- I can't!
- Just breathe.

37:44.094 --> 37:45.959
Breathe? Oh, my God,
am I not breathing?

37:47.931 --> 37:49.530
- Oh!
- I want to get off. I want to get off!

37:49.532 --> 37:51.599
Lester, breathe with me.

37:51.601 --> 37:53.668
In. Out.

37:53.670 --> 37:57.706
Slower. In. Out.

38:00.811 --> 38:02.577
That's the way.

38:07.818 --> 38:10.684
So it's emotionally
responsive.

38:10.686 --> 38:12.086
Fascinating.

38:12.088 --> 38:15.423
All right, so...
how's this thing work?

38:15.425 --> 38:16.691
Yeah. Please help me.

38:16.693 --> 38:18.559
It's not that simple.

38:18.561 --> 38:19.827
I need to take a scan,

38:19.829 --> 38:22.363
run a whole battery of
test scenarios.

38:22.365 --> 38:26.034
Okay, then, so, um,
just gonna let myself out.

38:26.036 --> 38:27.769
Mm-hm.

38:27.771 --> 38:30.738
Wait. You're leaving?
Why?

38:30.740 --> 38:34.641
Uh, well...

38:34.643 --> 38:35.976
I gotta fix my wall,

38:35.978 --> 38:38.713
cover our tracks,

38:38.715 --> 38:41.849
and I have to concoct
an airtight alibi.

38:41.851 --> 38:43.717
- Alibi?
- Well, yeah.

38:43.719 --> 38:44.885
We don't want to
go to prison.

38:44.887 --> 38:46.121
We're going to prison?!

38:46.123 --> 38:48.123
No! No, of course not.

38:48.125 --> 38:50.992
And anyway, as long as
you're in that suit,

38:50.994 --> 38:54.162
they don't make a cell
strong enough to hold you.

38:54.164 --> 38:56.467
Oh, yeah. Right.

39:01.070 --> 39:04.873
So, that suit can
blast through anything?

39:04.875 --> 39:06.173
Weren't you leaving?

39:06.175 --> 39:08.809
Uh, yeah, hey, look.

39:08.811 --> 39:10.512
I'm sorry about that.

39:10.514 --> 39:13.514
You know, it's been
a really long, crazy day,

39:13.516 --> 39:16.753
and I guess I just...
I... I panicked.

39:18.822 --> 39:20.155
I get it, Hank.

39:20.157 --> 39:21.623
It's okay.

39:21.625 --> 39:24.057
Looks like it's gonna be
a long night.

39:24.059 --> 39:25.793
Do you have any coffee?

39:25.795 --> 39:28.095
I only have herbal tea.

39:28.097 --> 39:30.164
Hey. I love herbal tea.

39:30.166 --> 39:31.932
Oh. Okay.

39:31.934 --> 39:34.536
Uh, well, I guess
I'll be right back.

39:34.538 --> 39:36.037
No rush.

39:36.039 --> 39:37.905
It's not like we're
goin' anywhere.

39:41.510 --> 39:43.211
Perfect.

39:43.213 --> 39:44.646
All right, kid, let's go.

39:44.648 --> 39:46.447
- But what about your tea?
- Shh.

39:46.449 --> 39:47.581
You want to be
a supervillain, right?

39:47.583 --> 39:48.682
Well, of course, but...

39:48.684 --> 39:49.918
I got a new plan, kid.

39:49.920 --> 39:51.786
One that will
totally fix this.

39:51.788 --> 39:54.054
And, well, everything.

39:54.056 --> 39:56.191
- Everything?
- Yeah.

39:56.193 --> 39:57.525
So what do you say?

39:57.527 --> 39:58.729
Apprentice.

40:01.565 --> 40:04.865
So, I have
Raspberry Dazzler,

40:04.867 --> 40:06.867
Blueberry Nighty-night,

40:06.869 --> 40:08.068
and Lemon...

40:08.070 --> 40:09.604
Ginger!

40:09.606 --> 40:11.873
Of course.

40:11.875 --> 40:14.478
You're gone.

40:15.579 --> 40:17.010
There we are.

40:17.012 --> 40:19.112
Roid Rage has got
his finger on the detonator,

40:19.114 --> 40:20.548
not a super hero in sight.

40:20.550 --> 40:21.950
Then what happened?

40:21.952 --> 40:25.686
Well, he finishes an
extended maniacal cackle,

40:25.688 --> 40:26.854
and it leaves him thirsty,

40:26.856 --> 40:28.490
so he takes
a sip of coffee,

40:28.492 --> 40:30.724
- and, boom!
- He blew up the planet.

40:30.726 --> 40:32.159
Classic Roid Rage.

40:32.161 --> 40:35.162
No, no.
Stew brought him decaf,

40:35.164 --> 40:36.597
Roid Rage flips out,

40:36.599 --> 40:39.133
completely trashes
his own lair,

40:39.135 --> 40:40.834
supers take full credit,
of course,

40:40.836 --> 40:43.704
but really, Stew saved
the entire world.

40:43.706 --> 40:47.175
Wow. I guess a lot can happen
on your first day, huh?

40:47.177 --> 40:48.775
Yeah, tell me about it.

40:48.777 --> 40:50.577
Oh! Story time.

40:50.579 --> 40:52.613
That was
a long time ago, kid.

40:52.615 --> 40:55.583
Wait, wait, wait.

40:55.585 --> 40:57.050
Proceed.

40:57.052 --> 40:58.853
Okay, okay.

40:58.855 --> 41:01.588
I was working for that
Baron Blackout guy...

41:05.128 --> 41:07.896
Ahh! A cow?

41:07.898 --> 41:10.130
Yeah, you nailed it, sir!

41:10.132 --> 41:11.766
I wasn't aiming for
the cow.

41:11.768 --> 41:14.536
I was aiming for that!

41:14.538 --> 41:15.603
Children?

41:15.605 --> 41:17.204
You can't do that.

41:17.206 --> 41:18.740
I'm Baron Blackout.

41:18.742 --> 41:20.608
I can do whatever I want.

41:22.012 --> 41:25.012
See that, trainee?
That's how it's done.

41:25.014 --> 41:27.749
More power.
Give me full power!

41:27.751 --> 41:29.550
No! You can't do this.

41:29.552 --> 41:31.019
Get her out of my sight.

41:32.188 --> 41:33.688
Sir, super heroes!

41:33.690 --> 41:34.755
Hello?

41:34.757 --> 41:37.057
Any baddie home?

41:37.059 --> 41:40.228
Captain Superior.

41:40.230 --> 41:42.296
I'm going to enjoy this.

41:44.634 --> 41:46.233
How's that for a headline?

41:46.235 --> 41:47.769
Here's a headline.

41:47.771 --> 41:49.304
Blathering heroes,

41:49.306 --> 41:52.072
fail to save children...

41:52.074 --> 41:53.974
then die.

41:53.976 --> 41:56.043
- Oh!
- Ha!

41:58.847 --> 42:00.213
What?
It can't be!

42:00.215 --> 42:02.717
No. No.

42:02.719 --> 42:04.686
No, no, no, no!

42:04.688 --> 42:06.588
My blackout ray.

42:06.590 --> 42:08.055
It happens to
the best of us.

42:08.057 --> 42:09.222
Huh?

42:11.193 --> 42:12.793
Hey! Shut up!

42:12.795 --> 42:13.961
Yes, sir.

42:13.963 --> 42:16.664
What's this?
How dare you.

42:16.666 --> 42:18.800
- Get him!
- Huh?

42:18.802 --> 42:20.934
<i>Wait a second,
I remember this one.</i>

42:20.936 --> 42:23.338
"Friendly Force Five,"
issue 126.

42:23.340 --> 42:25.072
"The Henchman with
a Heart of Gold."

42:25.074 --> 42:26.673
Please don't call me that.

42:26.675 --> 42:28.208
<i>Yeah,
and right after that,</i>

42:28.210 --> 42:30.845
<i>Baron was all like,
"Strategic retreat!"</i>

42:30.847 --> 42:32.679
<i>And then he took off in his
secret escape pod thingy.</i>

42:34.617 --> 42:36.851
<i>The henchmen had to
surrender, and were, like...</i>

42:36.853 --> 42:39.153
<i>"Do you know
what you've done?</i>

42:39.155 --> 42:40.988
<i>And you were, like,
"I saved those kids."</i>

42:40.990 --> 42:42.724
<i>And he said,</i>

42:42.726 --> 42:45.360
<i>"I'm gonna tell the Union
all about it"</i>

42:45.362 --> 42:48.095
<i>And then everybody
laughed and laughed,</i>

42:48.097 --> 42:50.697
<i>and laughed, and laughed.</i>

42:52.835 --> 42:54.302
And as for you...

42:54.304 --> 42:57.271
I've been pushing a mop
ever since.

42:57.273 --> 42:59.374
Right.

42:59.376 --> 43:01.409
Okay, lift, kid.

43:03.413 --> 43:04.711
There.
That should be enough.

43:04.713 --> 43:06.014
Enough for what?

43:06.016 --> 43:07.248
You want to be
a supervillain,

43:07.250 --> 43:09.416
you gotta learn
how to use the suit.

43:09.418 --> 43:11.119
How am I gonna do that?

43:11.121 --> 43:13.420
All you need is
the right motivation.

43:15.291 --> 43:17.025
Whoa!

43:17.027 --> 43:19.327
Ahh!

43:19.329 --> 43:20.994
Ahh! Huh?

43:20.996 --> 43:23.331
Ahh!

43:24.900 --> 43:27.168
Uh-oh.
Whoa-oh-oh!

43:27.170 --> 43:30.003
<i>♪ I keep rollin'
down the road ♪</i>

43:33.909 --> 43:35.876
- Go!
- Oh!

43:37.347 --> 43:39.447
<i>♪ I keep rollin'
down the road ♪</i>

43:39.449 --> 43:41.883
Whoops.

43:43.353 --> 43:45.318
<i>♪ I ain't got me nobody ♪</i>

43:45.320 --> 43:47.954
- Kid?
- I'm okay.

43:47.956 --> 43:49.356
Fire!

43:49.358 --> 43:50.425
- Hey!
- Sorry.

43:51.427 --> 43:53.827
Fire!

43:53.829 --> 43:55.063
Come on, dig deep.

44:02.204 --> 44:05.338
Wow!

44:05.340 --> 44:07.307
Yeah! That was great!

44:07.309 --> 44:10.244
- Fire.
- Fire!

44:10.246 --> 44:12.813
Ah-ha!

44:12.815 --> 44:14.347
Oh, no.

44:16.052 --> 44:17.818
- Oh.
- Ahh! Ahh!

44:23.193 --> 44:24.358
Come on.

44:26.195 --> 44:28.795
- Yes!
- Yeah! Ooh!

44:28.797 --> 44:30.063
Excuse me.

44:33.235 --> 44:34.267
Yeah!

44:34.269 --> 44:36.204
Whoo!

44:36.206 --> 44:37.204
You got this.

44:37.206 --> 44:38.472
Yeah!

44:38.474 --> 44:40.974
Woo!
Wow!

44:40.976 --> 44:42.075
Fire!

44:46.483 --> 44:48.118
Hi-ya!

44:55.023 --> 44:57.157
<i>Whoa, yeah.
There was, like, 20 of 'em.</i>

44:57.159 --> 44:58.425
<i>Yeah,
and pretty sure they were</i>

44:58.427 --> 45:01.362
- telepathic, cyborg...
- Ninjas.

45:01.364 --> 45:03.965
They're just lucky I didn't
bring my nunchuckers to work.

45:03.967 --> 45:07.235
Yeah. Bloop is like
deadly with nunchucks.

45:07.237 --> 45:09.369
You don't even know.
Hi-ya!

45:09.371 --> 45:10.871
Hey, hey, hey!

45:10.873 --> 45:12.039
Hey!

45:12.041 --> 45:13.407
- Give me that.
- Oh, dizzy.

45:13.409 --> 45:16.177
Get outta here,
you...

45:17.413 --> 45:19.546
To the perpetrators
of this theft,

45:19.548 --> 45:23.251
I don't care if you're
a telepathic cyborg ninja...

45:23.253 --> 45:24.851
or any other kind of ninja...

45:24.853 --> 45:28.322
you will be caught,
and you will be punished!

45:28.324 --> 45:30.391
That is all.

45:30.393 --> 45:33.427
Someone's in
very deep doodoo.

45:33.429 --> 45:36.463
Yeah. Just how stupid
do you gotta be

45:36.465 --> 45:38.266
to break our only law?

45:38.268 --> 45:40.434
- Hey, guys.
- Hank!

45:40.436 --> 45:42.436
Who's thirsty?

45:42.438 --> 45:45.005
Not me, boss.
Lookie here.

45:49.045 --> 45:51.045
Ahh...

45:51.047 --> 45:53.414
Ah... Ahh.

45:53.416 --> 45:55.282
Ahh.

45:55.284 --> 45:56.953
It's bottomless.
Like me.

45:58.221 --> 46:00.822
So, Hank,
you guys done or what?

46:00.824 --> 46:03.023
Yeah. Yeah,
you could say that.

46:03.025 --> 46:04.958
Great. Let's get
back to work.

46:04.960 --> 46:06.561
Whoa, guys.
Hold on a second.

46:06.563 --> 46:09.362
It's, uh...
It's the kid.

46:09.364 --> 46:12.335
Dead already. Well,
I've outlived another one.

46:13.570 --> 46:16.304
Okay, so last night...

46:16.306 --> 46:18.505
the kid and I,
we were working...

46:18.507 --> 46:21.441
at the museum.

46:21.443 --> 46:22.510
Museum!

46:22.512 --> 46:24.478
- No!
- Huh?

46:24.480 --> 46:27.914
- What?
- Uh... is closed,

46:27.916 --> 46:30.851
so, sorry, guys.
Can't go there today.

46:30.853 --> 46:32.485
Aww...

46:32.487 --> 46:34.054
Keep it down.

46:34.056 --> 46:36.057
Hank, what's going on?

46:36.059 --> 46:38.092
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I think I got it.

46:38.094 --> 46:40.461
The kid saw the thieves.

46:40.463 --> 46:43.264
No, it's, uh... it's
a little worse than that.

46:43.266 --> 46:45.333
Worse? How?
I mean, it's not like

46:45.335 --> 46:48.338
you guys did it,
or something.

46:51.541 --> 46:54.374
- Oh, Hank.
- Huh?

46:54.376 --> 46:55.943
Oh.

46:55.945 --> 46:57.945
Oh, now that's not even
close to funny, man.

46:57.947 --> 46:59.079
It was just an accident.

46:59.081 --> 47:01.615
Breaking a lamp is
just an accident.

47:01.617 --> 47:04.952
- This is...
- As bad as it gets. I know.

47:04.954 --> 47:07.988
Listen, if I could just
get the kid back in there,

47:07.990 --> 47:09.523
I can make this all go away.

47:09.525 --> 47:11.525
Great!
Then go do it.

47:11.527 --> 47:13.494
Put our drinks
on your tab anyway.

47:13.496 --> 47:15.496
Yeah,
what you waitin' for?

47:15.498 --> 47:19.266
- Uh, well...
- He needs our help.

47:19.268 --> 47:21.168
Don't ya, Hank?

47:21.170 --> 47:24.374
Yeah, I really do.

47:25.541 --> 47:27.108
Hank calls this a plan?

47:27.110 --> 47:29.242
More like robot
assisted suicide.

47:29.244 --> 47:31.378
Relax.
We've totally got this.

47:31.380 --> 47:32.545
Don't we, old timer?

47:32.547 --> 47:34.514
I have a pot
on my head.

47:34.516 --> 47:35.916
Here they come.

47:35.918 --> 47:37.385
Get ready, kid.

47:37.387 --> 47:40.454
And that's when I had to
register these bad boys

47:40.456 --> 47:42.590
as deadly weapons.

47:42.592 --> 47:44.391
Want to see why?

47:44.393 --> 47:47.128
You?
What about you?

47:47.130 --> 47:49.530
I'll take that as a yes.
Ready. Set. Hit.

47:49.532 --> 47:52.066
Stun. Karate. Judo.
Spin-a-rama!

47:52.068 --> 47:53.133
Dead!

47:53.135 --> 47:55.269
- Huh? Whoa.
- Ow!

47:55.271 --> 47:57.537
Hey, watch it, buddy.

47:57.539 --> 47:59.673
Halt!
This is a crime scene.

47:59.675 --> 48:01.575
Authorized personnel
only.

48:01.577 --> 48:03.577
Yeah, move it or lose it.

48:03.579 --> 48:07.315
Easy there, handsome.

48:07.317 --> 48:09.684
Lady bot.

48:09.686 --> 48:13.487
We are here on
official union...

48:13.489 --> 48:14.621
business.

48:16.592 --> 48:17.691
Let's go.

48:17.693 --> 48:19.427
Uh, 'scuse me, miss, uh,

48:19.429 --> 48:21.628
I'm gonna need to see
some, uh...

48:21.630 --> 48:22.697
credentials.

48:22.699 --> 48:24.965
Oh! Uh...

48:24.967 --> 48:26.300
- Credentials?
- Oh!

48:26.302 --> 48:27.467
I don't need no credentials.

48:27.469 --> 48:30.037
I got pinchy,
and I got flippy.

48:30.039 --> 48:32.206
Oh. Uh...

48:32.208 --> 48:35.508
Stew's not really
a robot. Run!

48:35.510 --> 48:37.311
- Ooh!
- Stop right now!

48:37.313 --> 48:38.713
Robot impersonators!

48:38.715 --> 48:40.046
Ahh. Ahh!

48:40.048 --> 48:41.481
They stole my nunchucks.

48:41.483 --> 48:42.985
Come back here, yous!

48:50.059 --> 48:52.325
Okay. All clear.
Come on.

48:52.327 --> 48:53.594
Uh, ooh.

48:53.596 --> 48:58.065
Wow.

48:58.067 --> 48:59.666
Did I really do all this?

48:59.668 --> 49:01.334
Yeah, you sure did.

49:01.336 --> 49:04.204
But, uh,
not for much longer.

49:04.206 --> 49:05.975
What do you mean?

49:07.076 --> 49:08.675
The plan.

49:08.677 --> 49:09.776
The Time Bandit?

49:09.778 --> 49:11.644
Not him. That.

49:11.646 --> 49:14.347
What-if-ium.
That's the plan?

49:14.349 --> 49:15.548
Yep. Like you said,

49:15.550 --> 49:17.385
it'll make all our dreams
come true.

49:17.387 --> 49:20.153
But then you told me to
get a grip on reality.

49:20.155 --> 49:22.155
Yeah, and then you
changed our reality,

49:22.157 --> 49:24.391
so, uh, blast away, kid.
We're in a hurry.

49:24.393 --> 49:25.492
Oh!

49:25.494 --> 49:27.096
Uh, okay, Hank.

49:31.166 --> 49:32.766
Oop... Ooh.

49:32.768 --> 49:34.300
Give me a minute.

49:36.572 --> 49:38.304
Okay.

49:38.306 --> 49:40.441
Come on.
Come on.

49:40.443 --> 49:42.646
And... fire!

49:46.548 --> 49:48.782
- Oh...
- Hmm.

49:48.784 --> 49:50.583
I got one more,
I got one more.

49:50.585 --> 49:52.452
Come on.

49:52.454 --> 49:53.653
Let's get some.

49:53.655 --> 49:56.125
And... fire!

49:59.795 --> 50:01.262
Come on!

50:10.172 --> 50:13.673
I'm sorry, Hank.
I just can't do it.

50:13.675 --> 50:15.612
It's okay, kid.

50:22.617 --> 50:25.552
Oh, boy.

50:25.554 --> 50:27.487
I mean, really.

50:27.489 --> 50:28.755
What was I thinking?

50:28.757 --> 50:30.758
You can't even push
a mop straight.

50:30.760 --> 50:32.092
What?

50:32.094 --> 50:33.693
It was my first day.

50:33.695 --> 50:36.831
Yeah, and you want to be
a supervillain.

50:36.833 --> 50:38.465
What are you saying?

50:38.467 --> 50:41.302
The real bad guys don't
throw in the towel

50:41.304 --> 50:42.735
the first time they get
a scratch.

50:42.737 --> 50:44.170
Hey!

50:44.172 --> 50:46.474
I've worked with
the best of the bad.

50:46.476 --> 50:48.775
Look around you.

50:48.777 --> 50:51.644
You ain't one of 'em.

50:51.646 --> 50:54.180
Hey, that's not fair.
This suit attacked me.

50:54.182 --> 50:55.483
The suit.

50:55.485 --> 50:57.450
Handed the ultimate weapon
on a silver platter.

50:57.452 --> 50:58.751
What?

50:58.753 --> 51:01.387
And not even that helps you
get the job done.

51:01.389 --> 51:02.856
What are you talking about?

51:02.858 --> 51:05.191
Oh, and that
supervillain name.

51:05.193 --> 51:06.860
The Orphan!

51:06.862 --> 51:09.229
Why don't you just
call yourself Pipe Dream.

51:09.231 --> 51:11.632
- What are you doing?
- How about Life Ruiner?

51:11.634 --> 51:13.333
'Cause you really did
a number on mine.

51:13.335 --> 51:14.601
Oh! Stop!

51:14.603 --> 51:16.537
I don't think
Fantastic Failure is taken.

51:16.539 --> 51:17.871
Shut up.

51:17.873 --> 51:20.206
Yeah, that's got
a real nice ring to it.

51:20.208 --> 51:21.474
I said shut up!

51:21.476 --> 51:23.644
It doesn't matter
what we call you

51:23.646 --> 51:25.512
because you're useless.

51:25.514 --> 51:27.347
Shut. Up!

51:27.349 --> 51:28.351
Whoa.

51:33.822 --> 51:35.389
Perfect.

51:37.626 --> 51:39.760
Whoa.

51:39.762 --> 51:42.496
Ha-ha! I knew
you could do it, kid.

51:42.498 --> 51:43.697
Man, that was something.

51:49.771 --> 51:51.273
Ah, man.

51:53.242 --> 51:55.809
Listen, I know that was
a real dirty trick,

51:55.811 --> 51:56.943
but it was the only way.

51:56.945 --> 51:59.646
I thought you were
my friend.

51:59.648 --> 52:01.849
Oh, I am, kid, really.

52:01.851 --> 52:02.853
I didn't mean it.

52:05.521 --> 52:08.655
And as soon as
we use this...

52:08.657 --> 52:10.559
I will never have
said it at all.

52:12.427 --> 52:14.260
You're under arrest.
Unhand the What-if-ium.

52:14.262 --> 52:16.729
- Oh, great.
- You are under arrest.

52:16.731 --> 52:18.566
- Unhand the What-if-ium.
- You are under arrest.

52:18.568 --> 52:19.934
Unhand the What-if-ium.

52:19.936 --> 52:22.302
You are under arrest.
Unhand the What-if-ium.

52:22.304 --> 52:23.272
You are under arrest.

52:26.309 --> 52:27.708
Huh?

52:29.277 --> 52:30.212
Ahh!

52:32.547 --> 52:34.150
You are under arrest.
Unhand the What-if-ium.

52:36.985 --> 52:39.552
What-if-ium?
Oh, no.

52:39.554 --> 52:41.554
Guys, what have you done?

52:41.556 --> 52:43.423
Man, I don't like this.
They should be here by now.

52:43.425 --> 52:45.325
Don't worry.
They will.

52:45.327 --> 52:46.894
I'm hearing those voices again, man.

52:46.896 --> 52:48.295
- Huh?
- Brakes, kid.

52:48.297 --> 52:49.697
Brakes, brakes, brakes,
brakes, brakes!

52:49.699 --> 52:51.434
Hit the brakes!

52:59.007 --> 53:00.708
Hank!

53:00.710 --> 53:02.309
Uh, huh!

53:03.713 --> 53:05.378
- Yeah.
- Are you all right?

53:05.380 --> 53:07.715
Yeah.

53:07.717 --> 53:08.749
I'll live.

53:08.751 --> 53:10.851
- Since when do you fly?
- <i>Da?</i>

53:10.853 --> 53:12.253
Uh...

53:12.255 --> 53:13.621
He doesn't.

53:13.623 --> 53:16.389
I do.

53:16.391 --> 53:17.858
Wait. Why are you
still in that thing?

53:17.860 --> 53:19.860
What's going on, Hank?

53:19.862 --> 53:22.595
You said you were gonna
make it "go away."

53:22.597 --> 53:24.999
I put air quotes around it
because those were your words.

53:25.001 --> 53:27.333
Ugh. Ahh!

53:27.335 --> 53:29.637
No, no, guys,
the plan worked perfectly.

53:29.639 --> 53:31.271
I got the What-if-ium.

53:31.273 --> 53:32.673
Whoa. What's that?

53:32.675 --> 53:35.909
This is the solution
to all of our problems.

53:35.911 --> 53:36.913
Huh?

53:39.347 --> 53:41.382
No, Hank.
Stop!

53:41.384 --> 53:43.883
- Who is that?
- This guy and his secrets.

53:43.885 --> 53:45.052
You can't do this!

53:45.054 --> 53:46.487
And why not?

53:46.489 --> 53:48.889
Because we have no idea
what it might do.

53:48.891 --> 53:52.659
Well, what it might do is
give us all a brand new life.

53:52.661 --> 53:54.394
We get to start again.

53:54.396 --> 53:56.063
Start what again?

53:56.065 --> 53:58.398
Everything.
I break this,

53:58.400 --> 53:59.967
the kid gets to be
a supervillain,

53:59.969 --> 54:01.702
and we don't have to be
henchmen anymore.

54:01.704 --> 54:04.371
- What?
- But you guys are all I have.

54:04.373 --> 54:05.639
<i>Da.</i>

54:05.641 --> 54:07.907
You can't make
this decision for us, Hank.

54:07.909 --> 54:09.376
She's right.

54:09.378 --> 54:11.512
Just think about this
for a second.

54:15.583 --> 54:16.650
I'm sorry, guys.

54:16.652 --> 54:17.653
No, don't!

54:20.056 --> 54:21.322
Huh?

54:28.063 --> 54:30.799
It's not your decision
to make, Hank.

54:32.068 --> 54:34.534
You did not just try to
erase my life.

54:34.536 --> 54:36.804
I was just trying to
make things better.

54:36.806 --> 54:38.539
- For all of us.
- No.

54:38.541 --> 54:39.740
You did this for you.

54:39.742 --> 54:41.541
- No, listen...
- Hank, admit it.

54:41.543 --> 54:43.443
- You lied to us.
- Well, yeah, but I mean...

54:43.445 --> 54:44.947
This is ridiculous.
Just stop!

54:46.815 --> 54:48.115
Let's go, guys.

54:48.117 --> 54:50.583
Something stinks
around here.

54:50.585 --> 54:51.985
<i>Da.</i>

54:51.987 --> 54:54.420
Guys, come on.
You know me.

54:54.422 --> 54:55.688
I wasn't trying to...

54:55.690 --> 54:58.425
Wait.
Guys, come on.

54:58.427 --> 55:00.094
We're a team.

55:02.364 --> 55:05.334
Come on, Lester.
Let's get you out of here.

55:11.474 --> 55:12.876
And out of this suit.

55:17.847 --> 55:18.848
Guys.

55:21.483 --> 55:23.483
What if it had worked?

55:23.485 --> 55:25.888
Then maybe you would have
been a better friend.

55:45.007 --> 55:47.141
Do you have to do that now?

55:47.143 --> 55:49.809
Well, I know some T. Swift
if you'd rather.

55:49.811 --> 55:52.412
Man, just do, like,
anything else.

55:52.414 --> 55:53.780
I do know something else.

55:53.782 --> 55:56.483
But only on the bagpipes.

55:56.485 --> 55:59.052
Bagpipes?!
Man, that's way worse.

55:59.054 --> 56:02.789
Look alive,
citizens of Loserville.

56:02.791 --> 56:04.490
I've got a job for you.

56:04.492 --> 56:05.925
Not interested, Biff.

56:05.927 --> 56:07.494
And I wasn't asking.

56:36.992 --> 56:40.226
<i>All right, who's next?</i>

56:40.228 --> 56:44.530
<i>Woohoo!</i>

56:44.532 --> 56:45.932
Come on, Yakov,
you've got this.

56:45.934 --> 56:48.469
<i>Da.</i>

56:48.471 --> 56:50.537
Ooh! Seven seconds.

56:50.539 --> 56:51.737
That's a new record.

56:51.739 --> 56:53.874
- You're next, handsome.
- Yeah, Hank.

56:53.876 --> 56:56.108
<i>Get over here.</i>

56:56.110 --> 56:57.610
Huh?

57:05.221 --> 57:07.954
Strike three!

57:09.492 --> 57:12.726
Boss?

57:12.728 --> 57:13.961
You're out, Hank.

57:13.963 --> 57:15.095
You could have killed me.

57:15.097 --> 57:17.597
Yeah.

57:17.599 --> 57:19.266
I know.

57:19.268 --> 57:21.168
Makin' a run for it,
huh?

57:21.170 --> 57:23.970
Well, I'm kinda low
on options.

57:23.972 --> 57:25.873
Low?

57:25.875 --> 57:27.974
No, Hank.
You're fresh out.

57:27.976 --> 57:30.776
Bring him in, boys.

57:30.778 --> 57:32.114
Oh, great.

57:33.983 --> 57:35.983
He's the most selfish...

57:35.985 --> 57:38.519
Obstinate...

57:38.521 --> 57:41.722
Meatheaded man
I have ever met.

57:42.891 --> 57:46.159
Uh... Are you sure
this is gonna work?

57:46.161 --> 57:48.662
Yes, Lester, of course.

57:48.664 --> 57:51.798
I just have to find
the right frequency.

57:51.800 --> 57:53.666
Ugh! He could have
killed us!

57:53.668 --> 57:56.936
- Yeah. Um, Jolene...
- But he knows best!

57:56.938 --> 57:59.273
Maybe we should take
a little... Ahhh!

57:59.275 --> 58:01.041
Trying to help?

58:01.043 --> 58:03.543
Yeah. Help himself!

58:03.545 --> 58:04.644
Henchmen.

58:04.646 --> 58:07.613
It's stuck!

58:07.615 --> 58:08.682
Oh! Lester.

58:08.684 --> 58:10.083
I'm so sorry.

58:10.085 --> 58:12.151
Ahh. Thanks.

58:12.153 --> 58:14.287
So...

58:14.289 --> 58:16.023
you're really mad
at Hank, huh?

58:16.025 --> 58:17.791
Yes! Aren't you?

58:17.793 --> 58:21.929
Uh, yeah, I am,
but Hank saved my life

58:21.931 --> 58:24.231
two minutes after
I met the guy.

58:24.233 --> 58:25.766
And back at the dump,

58:25.768 --> 58:28.302
he really thought it was
our best chance.

58:28.304 --> 58:30.637
You mean <i>his</i> best chance.

58:30.639 --> 58:32.072
Oh, he was wrong.
For sure.

58:32.074 --> 58:33.773
No doubt about that.

58:33.775 --> 58:36.309
- I... I just think he's...
- Selfish? Stubborn?

58:36.311 --> 58:39.646
- And totally...
- Lost.

58:39.648 --> 58:42.349
He feels trapped.

58:42.351 --> 58:44.217
I know that feeling.

58:44.219 --> 58:49.188
It made me think I wanted
to be a supervillain.

58:49.190 --> 58:53.195
Turns out, I was just...
lonely.

58:54.663 --> 58:58.699
And these bad guys
seemed really good at...

58:58.701 --> 59:00.666
being alone.

59:00.668 --> 59:01.702
Ahhh!

59:01.704 --> 59:03.804
Oh! Sorry.

59:06.742 --> 59:08.108
- Biff.
- Yes, sir?

59:08.110 --> 59:09.943
Who are they?

59:09.945 --> 59:13.079
Uh, well, these are
the new henchmen, sir.

59:13.081 --> 59:14.815
Henchmen for whom,

59:14.817 --> 59:16.983
the evil Quicky Lube?

59:20.389 --> 59:22.755
Actually, we prefer
henchpeople.

59:22.757 --> 59:24.691
Shut your talkin' hole,
recruit!

59:24.693 --> 59:25.691
Recruit?

59:25.693 --> 59:27.293
You kidnapped us, dude.

59:27.295 --> 59:28.996
Oh, boo-hoo.

59:28.998 --> 59:31.231
You're in big trouble
with the Union.

59:31.233 --> 59:35.135
Oh, are we now?

59:35.137 --> 59:37.970
Well, then, I'd better
get rid of the evidence.

59:37.972 --> 59:41.240
Stand against the wall.

59:41.242 --> 59:43.275
That is one creepy smile.

59:48.317 --> 59:50.784
- Baron, stop!
- What?

59:50.786 --> 59:52.052
Uh, sorry, sir.

59:52.054 --> 59:54.186
I mean,
we really need them.

59:54.188 --> 59:56.990
We have electrical issues.
We really need a cook.

59:56.992 --> 59:58.391
- Oh...
- And the bathrooms.

59:58.393 --> 01:00:00.260
Whatever those zombies
are doing in there,

01:00:00.262 --> 01:00:02.295
it's more like an eight
than a number two.

01:00:02.297 --> 01:00:04.430
Oh, fine!
Put them to work.

01:00:04.432 --> 01:00:05.666
Whew.

01:00:05.668 --> 01:00:07.200
I'll just zap them later.

01:00:08.936 --> 01:00:12.204
I'm ready.
Let's go, full blast!

01:00:14.677 --> 01:00:16.409
Huh?
Uh, wait a second.

01:00:16.411 --> 01:00:18.912
- Wh... What's happening?
- I'm sorry, Lester.

01:00:18.914 --> 01:00:21.882
I've tried every frequency
on the spectrum.

01:00:21.884 --> 01:00:23.416
What? No.

01:00:23.418 --> 01:00:25.151
Jolene,
you have to get me out.

01:00:25.153 --> 01:00:26.353
You said this would work.

01:00:26.355 --> 01:00:28.320
I know. I really
thought it would.

01:00:28.322 --> 01:00:29.755
What if I have
a late growth spurt?

01:00:29.757 --> 01:00:32.291
Uh, that's not gonna happen.

01:00:32.293 --> 01:00:33.793
I'm never gonna see
my toes again.

01:00:33.795 --> 01:00:35.762
That's very unlikely.

01:00:35.764 --> 01:00:39.066
Oh, I'm just gonna
do this myself.

01:00:39.068 --> 01:00:40.233
Lester.

01:00:40.235 --> 01:00:42.302
Aw! Piece of junk.

01:00:42.304 --> 01:00:44.371
- This isn't the way.
- Aha!

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:48.311
Now we're talking.

01:00:54.115 --> 01:00:55.215
- Stop it.
- What?

01:00:55.217 --> 01:00:56.983
How, exactly?

01:00:56.985 --> 01:00:58.719
- This thing jumped on me.
- Lester.

01:00:58.721 --> 01:01:01.487
I didn't ask for it.
Mind control, my butt.

01:01:01.489 --> 01:01:04.825
Oh, great.
Now my butt's itchy.

01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:06.827
Lester, that's it!

01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:08.929
- My butt?
- No, your mind!

01:01:08.931 --> 01:01:10.930
Yeah, I know!
I'm losing my mind!

01:01:10.932 --> 01:01:12.264
Your happy place.

01:01:12.266 --> 01:01:14.501
Just close your eyes

01:01:14.503 --> 01:01:17.237
and remember a time
when you felt safe

01:01:17.239 --> 01:01:18.804
and cared for.

01:01:18.806 --> 01:01:21.807
Uh, you do know I'm
an orphan, right?

01:01:21.809 --> 01:01:23.476
Just try, Lester.

01:01:23.478 --> 01:01:24.510
Please.

01:01:24.512 --> 01:01:27.246
Okay, okay.

01:01:27.248 --> 01:01:29.749
♪ Comic book nerd,
comic book nerd ♪

01:01:29.751 --> 01:01:33.220
I'm not sure I have
a happy place.

01:01:33.222 --> 01:01:35.692
Happy place, happy place,
happy place.

01:01:47.835 --> 01:01:49.769
Way to go, Lester.

01:01:49.771 --> 01:01:51.239
I knew you could do it.

01:01:53.141 --> 01:01:57.409
<i>Lester? Lester?</i>

01:01:57.411 --> 01:01:59.246
Lester.

01:01:59.248 --> 01:02:00.880
Are you all right?

01:02:00.882 --> 01:02:04.252
Uh, I think so.
It's just... Huh?

01:02:06.054 --> 01:02:08.387
Whoa!

01:02:08.389 --> 01:02:10.557
It worked!

01:02:10.559 --> 01:02:13.425
It really worked! Thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:02:13.427 --> 01:02:15.262
Uh, you're welcome.

01:02:15.264 --> 01:02:16.862
What was the that?

01:02:16.864 --> 01:02:20.400
- Denizens of Supervillain City...
- Come on!

01:02:20.402 --> 01:02:23.438
...it is I, Baron Blackout!

01:02:29.545 --> 01:02:32.144
I can't believe this.

01:02:32.146 --> 01:02:33.579
I am taking over the world,

01:02:33.581 --> 01:02:37.050
starting with this
wretched island.

01:02:40.822 --> 01:02:42.891
Oh, no. Lester, run!

01:02:52.568 --> 01:02:54.601
What in the blue blazes
is going on, Hank!

01:02:54.603 --> 01:02:56.302
How should I know?
I'm not Baron Blackout!

01:02:56.304 --> 01:02:58.371
It's always you, Corrigan.

01:02:58.373 --> 01:03:00.340
Every time something's screwy,
it's your fault.

01:03:00.342 --> 01:03:02.208
I... Huh?

01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:05.045
Hey, boss, stop!
I gotta get my crew.

01:03:05.047 --> 01:03:07.315
You don't have
a crew anymore, Hank.

01:03:09.050 --> 01:03:10.916
Hey! Stop it!

01:03:10.918 --> 01:03:13.086
What do you think
you're doing? Whoa!

01:03:13.088 --> 01:03:14.257
Uh-oh.

01:03:16.123 --> 01:03:17.092
Aah!

01:03:28.637 --> 01:03:32.137
Now that I have
your undivided attention...

01:03:32.139 --> 01:03:34.206
Hey!

01:03:34.208 --> 01:03:35.608
No fleeing.

01:03:35.610 --> 01:03:38.244
Now, listen.
I have a pressing appointment

01:03:38.246 --> 01:03:40.347
with the Friendly Force Five,

01:03:40.349 --> 01:03:41.947
so I'll keep this short.

01:03:41.949 --> 01:03:44.351
Serve me or die.

01:04:07.976 --> 01:04:10.175
- You're mine, Corrigan!
- Oh!

01:04:10.177 --> 01:04:13.979
I'm taking you in
if it's the last thing I do!

01:04:13.981 --> 01:04:16.249
Get off of me!
Sorry, boss.

01:04:16.251 --> 01:04:19.452
Just listen,
I have a plan.

01:04:19.454 --> 01:04:22.255
Let me guess.
Lay low, do the bare minimum,

01:04:22.257 --> 01:04:24.293
and sit on your a...

01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:26.992
Nope. Not this time.

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:33.599
Hmm? Oh!

01:04:33.601 --> 01:04:37.403
Guys! Anyone here?

01:04:37.405 --> 01:04:39.139
- Hank?
- Doug!

01:04:39.141 --> 01:04:42.141
You're alive!
No, I just lost five bucks,

01:04:42.143 --> 01:04:44.043
but I'm happy to see you.

01:04:44.045 --> 01:04:45.679
Don't worry.
We're all getting out of here.

01:04:45.681 --> 01:04:48.447
- Now, where's the crew?
- Well, Biff took 'em.

01:04:48.449 --> 01:04:50.550
Oh, no. Blackout!

01:04:50.552 --> 01:04:52.889
Blackout?
Is that why I can't see?

01:04:54.322 --> 01:04:57.023
It's time I did
what henchmen do best.

01:04:57.025 --> 01:04:59.291
Got ya! Torch the bar
and move to Mexico!

01:04:59.293 --> 01:05:00.626
No, fix it.

01:05:00.628 --> 01:05:02.162
I got 'em into this mess,

01:05:02.164 --> 01:05:04.229
and I'm gonna get 'em out.

01:05:04.231 --> 01:05:06.235
Great!
Let's wear matching outfits.

01:05:07.635 --> 01:05:09.369
Sorry, old-timer,
but I gotta do this one solo.

01:05:09.371 --> 01:05:11.338
Oh, thank goodness.

01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:13.238
Doug, I really need a favor.

01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:18.177
Yeah, give me names, Hank.
Consider 'em dead.

01:05:18.179 --> 01:05:22.349
Terri Murphy here with
an Apex City News exclusive.

01:05:22.351 --> 01:05:24.050
A supervillain has just parked

01:05:24.052 --> 01:05:25.719
on the Friendly Force Five
front door.

01:05:25.721 --> 01:05:28.190
Ooh! Here they come now.

01:05:31.525 --> 01:05:35.195
- Hey, I remember this loser.
- Yes, so do I.

01:05:35.197 --> 01:05:37.363
He ran away like
a little baby chicken.

01:05:40.202 --> 01:05:41.467
Oh?

01:05:43.005 --> 01:05:46.673
You guys go ahead.
I'll catch up in a bit.

01:05:46.675 --> 01:05:50.209
Every time.

01:05:50.211 --> 01:05:53.512
- Hello, Chicken Man.
- Well, hello there.

01:05:53.514 --> 01:05:55.481
Long time, no see.

01:05:55.483 --> 01:05:58.017
Yeah, you get your little thingy fixed?

01:05:58.019 --> 01:06:00.353
How about I show you?

01:06:00.355 --> 01:06:02.655
This goes a lot faster
without Captain Blabbermouth...

01:06:05.659 --> 01:06:08.795
My many, many superpowers.

01:06:08.797 --> 01:06:11.296
Your team, they're all gone.

01:06:11.298 --> 01:06:12.432
Shh, shh, shh!

01:06:14.036 --> 01:06:16.369
- Capisce? That's Spanish.
- Italian.

01:06:16.371 --> 01:06:18.438
Sure, I can do pasta.
Pick you up at seven?

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:20.572
You are the stupidest man...

01:06:20.574 --> 01:06:22.277
Ah! Mama!

01:06:24.246 --> 01:06:26.315
Baron Blackout.

01:06:35.690 --> 01:06:37.159
It's all clear.

01:06:42.563 --> 01:06:44.563
Whoa.

01:06:44.565 --> 01:06:45.667
Ugh.

01:06:47.835 --> 01:06:49.802
I can't believe it.

01:06:49.804 --> 01:06:52.304
Here's Dougie!

01:06:52.306 --> 01:06:53.539
Old Doug?

01:06:53.541 --> 01:06:56.342
Say, I'm looking for
that sciency lady.

01:06:56.344 --> 01:06:57.577
You mean Jolene?

01:06:57.579 --> 01:06:59.179
Close enough.

01:06:59.181 --> 01:07:01.447
- You're here to see me?
- Sure am.

01:07:01.449 --> 01:07:04.818
Hank sent me here to give
you an important massage.

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:07.554
- Oh, uh...
- Ooh, I meant message,

01:07:07.556 --> 01:07:09.289
like them fancy emails.

01:07:09.291 --> 01:07:12.624
Just something about Hank
surviving the mission,

01:07:12.626 --> 01:07:14.726
risking life and limb
to redeem himself.

01:07:14.728 --> 01:07:17.162
- I don't know.
- Doug! Survive what mission?

01:07:17.164 --> 01:07:19.231
Oh, sticking it
to the man, man.

01:07:19.233 --> 01:07:20.633
He's going after Blackout.

01:07:20.635 --> 01:07:22.235
Hank's taking on the Baron?

01:07:22.237 --> 01:07:23.869
- Alone?
- He is?

01:07:23.871 --> 01:07:28.307
- He'll be obliterated.
- Obliterated with a capitol "D ."

01:07:28.309 --> 01:07:29.742
Oh, no.

01:07:38.719 --> 01:07:42.488
Oh, this took so long...

01:07:42.490 --> 01:07:44.124
but, boy, was it worth it.

01:07:44.126 --> 01:07:47.860
Update me, Biff.

01:07:47.862 --> 01:07:50.530
Sir, you've defeated
the Supers.

01:07:50.532 --> 01:07:53.867
Your mindless horde has
Apex City in total panic,

01:07:53.869 --> 01:07:56.635
and the president is awaiting
your demands.

01:07:56.637 --> 01:08:01.508
Perfect. It's all just
so bloody perfect.

01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:03.610
Incoming craft, sir.

01:08:03.612 --> 01:08:05.744
- What?
- Weapons detected, sir.

01:08:05.746 --> 01:08:07.146
We are under attack.

01:08:07.148 --> 01:08:09.282
Who would dare?

01:08:09.284 --> 01:08:13.222
Hey, Blackout!
Say hello to my little friend!

01:08:26.902 --> 01:08:27.901
Was that it?

01:08:27.903 --> 01:08:30.569
I know, right?

01:08:30.572 --> 01:08:32.772
He may as well have thrown
a sandal at us.

01:08:32.774 --> 01:08:35.942
He was all like, "I'm gonna be
a big hero, save the world."

01:08:35.944 --> 01:08:39.912
And our ship was all like,
"I don't think so, son!"

01:08:39.913 --> 01:08:42.451
Zoom in.
Who is this dolt?

01:08:43.917 --> 01:08:47.286
- Hank Corrigan.
- I remember that face!

01:08:47.287 --> 01:08:48.389
Traitor.

01:08:51.457 --> 01:08:53.393
Oh! Uh...

01:09:02.938 --> 01:09:05.274

Oh, no, no, no,
it's not fake news.

01:10:16.278 --> 01:10:17.378
Baron, look!

01:10:19.381 --> 01:10:20.883
Why isn't he dead?

01:10:22.516 --> 01:10:24.220

01:10:26.354 --> 01:10:30.759

Wait.

01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:37.900
Oh, no.

01:10:42.770 --> 01:10:44.370
No!

01:10:49.511 --> 01:10:51.076
Baron?

01:10:52.713 --> 01:10:54.680
My blackout ray!

01:10:54.682 --> 01:10:55.815
The ray is undamaged, sir.

01:10:55.817 --> 01:10:57.416
Oh, thank goodness.

01:10:57.418 --> 01:10:59.686
I thought I'd lost you,
but you're okay.

01:10:59.688 --> 01:11:02.921
Yes. Yes, you are.

01:11:02.923 --> 01:11:04.723
- Baron!
- Huh?

01:11:09.698 --> 01:11:10.929
Whoa!

01:11:10.931 --> 01:11:11.964
Not yet.

01:11:11.966 --> 01:11:15.401
So, Hank, is it?

01:11:15.403 --> 01:11:18.603
- Yeah.
- Okay, Hank.

01:11:18.605 --> 01:11:22.342
Now, what exactly is it
about me in particular

01:11:22.344 --> 01:11:24.544
that drives a nothing like you

01:11:24.546 --> 01:11:27.446
to such absurdly heroic acts?

01:11:27.448 --> 01:11:28.947
My friends.

01:11:28.949 --> 01:11:31.451
Like a dare?

01:11:31.453 --> 01:11:33.352
No, like you took them.

01:11:33.354 --> 01:11:34.986
Oh, I see.

01:11:34.988 --> 01:11:38.558
So you're here to demand
their safe return or else.

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:39.692
That was the plan.

01:11:39.694 --> 01:11:42.562
You do realize you're unarmed.

01:11:42.564 --> 01:11:45.565
- I dropped my gun.
- Yes, I saw that.

01:11:45.567 --> 01:11:46.732
Well, how 'bout this?

01:11:46.734 --> 01:11:48.367
You want your friends,

01:11:48.369 --> 01:11:50.503
just ask.

01:11:50.505 --> 01:11:51.737
Very funny.

01:11:51.739 --> 01:11:53.473
Ask me now.

01:11:53.475 --> 01:11:55.441
I insist.

01:11:55.443 --> 01:11:57.043
Okay.

01:11:57.045 --> 01:11:58.777
May I have my crew back?

01:11:58.779 --> 01:12:00.112
Hmm.

01:12:00.114 --> 01:12:01.981
Let me think.

01:12:01.983 --> 01:12:02.918
No!

01:12:04.152 --> 01:12:06.152
- Oh!
- You're dead, Corrigan.

01:12:07.921 --> 01:12:09.589
Goodbye, worm.

01:12:10.591 --> 01:12:13.726
Ahh!

01:12:15.497 --> 01:12:16.995
Lester,
what are you doing here?

01:12:16.997 --> 01:12:18.664
Just passing by.

01:12:18.666 --> 01:12:19.732
Kill him now!

01:12:19.734 --> 01:12:21.166
- Huh!
- Watch out!

01:12:23.771 --> 01:12:25.036
Ahh, come on!

01:12:25.038 --> 01:12:26.873
Yeeha!

01:12:26.875 --> 01:12:28.607
Ugh! They keep coming!

01:12:28.609 --> 01:12:30.410
Need a rescue,
henchman?

01:12:30.412 --> 01:12:33.478
You're dead meat, Corrigan!

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:35.013
Go get the crew!

01:12:35.015 --> 01:12:36.648
I got this.

01:12:36.650 --> 01:12:38.151
- You sure, kid?
- No,

01:12:38.153 --> 01:12:39.184
but do it anyway.

01:12:39.186 --> 01:12:40.887
- Let's go!
- Oh!

01:12:44.158 --> 01:12:45.657
After them,
you idiots!

01:12:45.659 --> 01:12:47.058
Yes, sir!

01:12:51.198 --> 01:12:52.898
So, what's the plan, Hank?

01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:54.834
We're gonna start by
running for our lives.

01:12:54.836 --> 01:12:55.934
Now, that's a plan.

01:12:55.936 --> 01:12:57.803
We got you now, Corrigan.

01:12:58.972 --> 01:13:00.376
In here.
Come on, quick.

01:13:01.842 --> 01:13:02.909
Marco!

01:13:02.911 --> 01:13:04.043
- Po...
- Shh.

01:13:04.045 --> 01:13:06.077
Ohh.

01:13:06.079 --> 01:13:08.714
Escape pod
leaving in 10 seconds.

01:13:08.716 --> 01:13:10.450
- Here we go.
- Huh?

01:13:10.452 --> 01:13:12.785
- Stew? Wow.
- 8... 7...

01:13:12.787 --> 01:13:15.655
- 6... 5...
- Old Doug?

01:13:15.657 --> 01:13:17.190
Old Doug?
He's here, too?

01:13:17.192 --> 01:13:18.993
Guys, wait.
Lester's still on the...

01:13:22.596 --> 01:13:24.597
Ship.

01:13:24.599 --> 01:13:25.932
Ahh!

01:13:25.934 --> 01:13:28.601
Now that
is an impressive suit.

01:13:28.603 --> 01:13:30.068
Ahh!

01:13:30.070 --> 01:13:32.071
Ahh! Ahh!

01:13:32.073 --> 01:13:33.539
But why are you using it

01:13:33.541 --> 01:13:35.708
to help a bunch of
useless henchmen?

01:13:35.710 --> 01:13:37.677
Because I am a henchman!

01:13:39.948 --> 01:13:41.981
Ahh! Ahh!

01:13:41.983 --> 01:13:45.718
Henchman? Ha!
You could be so much more.

01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:47.887
Give me that suit,

01:13:47.889 --> 01:13:50.822
and I'll teach you
everything you need to know.

01:13:50.824 --> 01:13:51.991
What?

01:13:51.993 --> 01:13:54.160
You want to train me?

01:13:54.162 --> 01:13:55.695
Oh, yes.

01:13:55.697 --> 01:13:58.231
Just think of what
you could become.

01:13:58.233 --> 01:14:00.599
You could be just like me.

01:14:00.601 --> 01:14:02.101
A supervillain?

01:14:02.103 --> 01:14:04.269
And not just any
supervillain.

01:14:04.271 --> 01:14:05.705
The Orphan.

01:14:05.707 --> 01:14:07.572
The Orphan?

01:14:07.574 --> 01:14:10.142
Oh, sure. Yes.

01:14:10.144 --> 01:14:11.878
Nobody to hold you back.

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:14.914
No family to worry about.
No friends.

01:14:14.916 --> 01:14:16.249
That's very good.

01:14:16.251 --> 01:14:18.584
No friends?

01:14:18.586 --> 01:14:20.986
Just you and me
together.

01:14:20.988 --> 01:14:24.656
Trust me.

01:14:24.658 --> 01:14:26.125
Okay.

01:14:26.127 --> 01:14:27.159
Okay, yeah.

01:14:27.161 --> 01:14:28.593
Deal.

01:14:28.595 --> 01:14:30.263
Perfect.

01:14:30.265 --> 01:14:31.863
Happy place.
Happy place.

01:14:31.865 --> 01:14:32.932
Whoo.

01:14:32.934 --> 01:14:35.268
Ahh!

01:14:44.311 --> 01:14:45.945
Fool.

01:14:45.947 --> 01:14:47.879
What are we
looking for here?

01:14:47.881 --> 01:14:51.017
It's a small vent,
about this big.

01:14:51.019 --> 01:14:52.285
You mean like that one?

01:14:52.287 --> 01:14:53.753
That's it!

01:14:53.755 --> 01:14:55.187
- We have to get down there.
- Whoa!

01:14:55.189 --> 01:14:58.624
Hey, Corrigan.
What do you think you're doin'?

01:14:58.626 --> 01:15:00.625
Oh, nothin',
just boring

01:15:00.627 --> 01:15:02.928
third class henchmen
janitor stuff.

01:15:02.930 --> 01:15:04.763
Very funny.
Drop it!

01:15:04.765 --> 01:15:07.900
You want me to drop
this wrench down there?

01:15:07.902 --> 01:15:09.168
- Ah!
- Oh!

01:15:09.170 --> 01:15:10.769
Just do it!

01:15:10.771 --> 01:15:12.671
You've got the gun,
you make the rules.

01:15:12.673 --> 01:15:13.805
Back.

01:15:13.807 --> 01:15:15.575
Little more.
Right there.

01:15:15.577 --> 01:15:16.642
Now!

01:15:19.581 --> 01:15:21.213
This is it.

01:15:21.215 --> 01:15:24.116
The end of the road
for Hank Chorrigan.

01:15:27.721 --> 01:15:29.354
How does it feel to lose
for the last time,

01:15:29.356 --> 01:15:30.923
loser?

01:15:30.925 --> 01:15:32.791
Well, Biff, it's like
that feeling.

01:15:32.793 --> 01:15:33.793
You know the one.

01:15:35.229 --> 01:15:37.129
When you realize
the idiot losers

01:15:37.131 --> 01:15:38.964
who build it and fix it...

01:15:38.966 --> 01:15:40.232
Uhh...

01:15:40.234 --> 01:15:42.602
Also know
exactly how to...

01:15:44.805 --> 01:15:45.840
- break it.
- Huh?

01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:49.008
Ohh!

01:15:49.010 --> 01:15:50.076
Now let's go!

01:15:50.078 --> 01:15:52.143
Corrigan!
Huh?

01:15:53.213 --> 01:15:56.081
Uh-oh.

01:16:01.088 --> 01:16:02.557
What was that?

01:16:08.029 --> 01:16:10.028
Ohh!

01:16:12.966 --> 01:16:13.902
Get ready.

01:16:27.849 --> 01:16:30.249
Come on, you.
Let's finish this.

01:16:30.251 --> 01:16:31.416
On!

01:16:31.418 --> 01:16:32.852
Attach!

01:16:32.854 --> 01:16:34.320
I said let's go!

01:16:34.322 --> 01:16:35.388
What happened?

01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:38.790
Oh! You're alive.

01:16:38.792 --> 01:16:40.192
Tell me how it works.

01:16:40.194 --> 01:16:41.760
Yeah, yeah, okay, okay.

01:16:41.762 --> 01:16:43.129
Now!

01:16:43.131 --> 01:16:46.766
Look, all you gotta do
is say the password.

01:16:46.768 --> 01:16:48.867
- What password?
- Password correct.

01:16:48.869 --> 01:16:52.772
Huh? Oh.
Oh, this is good.

01:16:52.774 --> 01:16:54.305
Oh, tickles a bit.

01:16:56.677 --> 01:16:57.876
It's a touch snug.

01:16:57.878 --> 01:17:00.146
Oh. Oh, yes.

01:17:00.148 --> 01:17:01.781
Oh, I can feel it.

01:17:05.019 --> 01:17:06.785
It's all mine.
The power.

01:17:06.787 --> 01:17:08.420
The power!

01:17:14.295 --> 01:17:15.294
Lester?

01:17:15.296 --> 01:17:17.798
- You!
- Blackout!

01:17:19.367 --> 01:17:20.766
Oh, no.

01:17:20.768 --> 01:17:22.768
Lester,
what have you done?

01:17:25.806 --> 01:17:27.440
Brilliant!

01:17:27.442 --> 01:17:30.241
Oh, this is gonna be
so much fun!

01:17:30.243 --> 01:17:33.314
So, Hank, how should we
end you? Hm?

01:17:35.082 --> 01:17:37.817
Ooh, yes. How about that?
Barbecue.

01:17:37.819 --> 01:17:40.052
No.

01:17:40.054 --> 01:17:43.054
What else can this baby do?

01:17:43.056 --> 01:17:44.190
Ha! Smoked!

01:17:46.828 --> 01:17:49.327
Frostbite!

01:17:49.329 --> 01:17:51.097
Confettied?

01:17:51.099 --> 01:17:53.065
Oh, that's a terrible idea.
Who put that in there?

01:17:53.067 --> 01:17:54.834
Why aim so small, sir?

01:17:54.836 --> 01:17:57.469
- Huh?
- Meddling henchmen like these two

01:17:57.471 --> 01:17:59.804
deserve something
a little more...

01:17:59.806 --> 01:18:01.473
diabolical.

01:18:01.475 --> 01:18:04.977
Kid. What are you...

01:18:04.979 --> 01:18:08.848
Oh! Have you met my new...
apprentice?

01:18:08.850 --> 01:18:10.816
Lester...

01:18:10.818 --> 01:18:12.384
Save it, Chorrigan.

01:18:12.386 --> 01:18:14.419
I finally know what
I'm supposed to do,

01:18:14.421 --> 01:18:15.955
and who I'm meant to be,

01:18:15.957 --> 01:18:17.490
no thanks to you.

01:18:18.993 --> 01:18:21.093
I am a supervillain.

01:18:21.095 --> 01:18:23.963
I am The Orphan!

01:18:23.965 --> 01:18:26.264
I just needed
the right mentor

01:18:26.266 --> 01:18:27.299
to teach me.

01:18:27.301 --> 01:18:28.901
That's very good.

01:18:28.903 --> 01:18:31.370
The is the Baron Blackout,

01:18:31.372 --> 01:18:33.973
the world's greatest
criminal mastermind.

01:18:33.975 --> 01:18:36.275
He answers to nobody.

01:18:36.277 --> 01:18:38.843
He commands
a giant warship.

01:18:38.845 --> 01:18:42.013
He turns entire cities
into mindless minions.

01:18:42.015 --> 01:18:44.916
Oh, yes.
I am spectacular.

01:18:44.918 --> 01:18:46.451
Yeah.
Keep talking.

01:18:46.453 --> 01:18:48.454
In "Friendly
Force Five," issue 80,

01:18:48.456 --> 01:18:51.523
he stole
the Diamond of Destiny!

01:18:51.525 --> 01:18:53.259
Oh, yes.
That was a good one.

01:18:53.261 --> 01:18:54.794
Ah, I remember that well.

01:18:54.796 --> 01:18:56.995
Or in "Moonbeam,"
issue 42,

01:18:56.997 --> 01:18:59.433
when he sunk
the unsinkable island!

01:19:01.135 --> 01:19:03.035
The power.

01:19:03.037 --> 01:19:05.571
Mine at last.
I feel the power!

01:19:05.573 --> 01:19:07.873
Or who could forget
"Earth Dude," 422,

01:19:07.875 --> 01:19:11.309
when he flattened
the Forest of Fortitude!

01:19:20.921 --> 01:19:23.888
No.

01:19:25.292 --> 01:19:27.026
And what have you done,
Hank?

01:19:27.028 --> 01:19:29.928
Who are you compared to
the great Baron Blackout?

01:19:29.930 --> 01:19:31.429
Lester.

01:19:35.036 --> 01:19:38.070
Why, with his mind
and that suit...

01:19:38.072 --> 01:19:40.104
anything is possible.

01:19:40.106 --> 01:19:42.340
What?

01:19:42.342 --> 01:19:44.442
Well, almost anything.

01:19:45.846 --> 01:19:47.178
Yes, that's the...

01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:49.180
What? Come again?

01:19:49.182 --> 01:19:50.950
Uh, you know what?
I just remembered.

01:19:50.952 --> 01:19:53.184
The Diamond of Destiny
was a dud, wasn't it?

01:19:53.186 --> 01:19:54.586
What? No! Never!

01:19:54.588 --> 01:19:56.321
Ahh! Ohh!

01:19:56.323 --> 01:19:58.490
And that island.

01:19:58.492 --> 01:20:00.491
I just remembered
it resurfaced.

01:20:00.493 --> 01:20:03.062
Yeah, pretty sure Blackout
ended up being chased off

01:20:03.064 --> 01:20:05.330
by a flock of
adorable hummingbirds.

01:20:05.332 --> 01:20:07.398
Ahh!
They were vicious!

01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:09.934
And didn't the Forest
of Fortitude grow back?

01:20:09.936 --> 01:20:11.269
- Ahh!
- Yeah, actually,

01:20:11.271 --> 01:20:13.071
I remember the last frame
of the comic.

01:20:13.073 --> 01:20:14.607
It was Baron here

01:20:14.609 --> 01:20:17.942
gettin' licked by a harmless
little tree frog.

01:20:17.944 --> 01:20:19.477
Ugh! It was... Ahh!

01:20:19.479 --> 01:20:20.979
Poisonous!

01:20:20.981 --> 01:20:23.214
You see, Baron,
that's the problem.

01:20:23.216 --> 01:20:24.616
Ow! Ohh! Ahh!

01:20:24.618 --> 01:20:26.151
You're a bad guy.

01:20:27.387 --> 01:20:28.620
And bad guys...

01:20:28.622 --> 01:20:31.490
always lose.

01:20:31.492 --> 01:20:32.657
What?!

01:20:41.002 --> 01:20:42.170
Whoa!

01:20:46.974 --> 01:20:48.641
Whoa!

01:20:48.643 --> 01:20:50.108
Oh!

01:20:55.181 --> 01:20:57.385
I will... not be bested...

01:20:59.052 --> 01:21:02.254
by a bunch of useless...

01:21:02.256 --> 01:21:05.193
henchmen!

01:21:14.601 --> 01:21:17.201
Was that good or bad?

01:21:17.203 --> 01:21:19.073
<i>Da!</i>

01:21:26.079 --> 01:21:28.446
Hey, guys.

01:21:28.448 --> 01:21:30.581
- Lester!
- What took you so long?

01:21:30.583 --> 01:21:33.585
Well, we just had
a little cleaning up to do.

01:21:33.587 --> 01:21:36.021
Spoken like
a true henchman.

01:21:36.023 --> 01:21:37.589
Welcome to the crew.

01:21:37.591 --> 01:21:40.491
Hey, Lester.

01:21:40.493 --> 01:21:41.693
Thanks.

01:21:41.695 --> 01:21:43.497
You got it, boss.

01:21:45.565 --> 01:21:46.568
Ah, come here.

01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:53.571
Aww.

01:21:53.573 --> 01:21:55.708
Isn't this just too sweet?

01:21:55.710 --> 01:21:57.977
I think I'm gonna cry.

01:21:57.979 --> 01:21:59.711
How are you
still alive, dude?

01:21:59.713 --> 01:22:02.214
'Cause Biff don't quit!
Ohh-oh. Ohh-oh.

01:22:02.216 --> 01:22:05.584
Ohh-oh. Ohh-oh.

01:22:07.188 --> 01:22:08.519
Oh, what's this?

01:22:08.521 --> 01:22:10.755
Sending the girl in
to fight your battles,

01:22:10.757 --> 01:22:12.590
huh, Chorrigan?

01:22:12.592 --> 01:22:14.192
What you figure, honey?

01:22:14.194 --> 01:22:16.394
You gonna come over here
and ask me out?

01:22:16.396 --> 01:22:17.463
Ahh!

01:22:17.465 --> 01:22:18.998
Oh!

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.733
