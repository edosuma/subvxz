00:00.185 --> 00:02.132
I saw on the news today,

00:02.167 --> 00:05.506
talking about the violence
in foreign countries.

00:06.887 --> 00:09.822
talking about all the savagery
up in the world,

00:10.025 --> 00:13.751
but they ain't never
talk about South Central.

00:15.227 --> 00:18.582
Ain't never talk about
what happened to my brother.

00:19.396 --> 00:21.764
Now he's gone.

00:21.798 --> 00:24.160
Now I ain't got no brother.

00:25.366 --> 00:28.433
Yo, dog.

00:30.569 --> 00:33.303
I'll be your brother.

00:33.338 --> 00:34.538
Really?

00:35.099 --> 00:37.117
Absolutely, dog.

00:38.008 --> 00:40.142
You're gonna need somebody
to lean on.

00:40.176 --> 00:42.110
You can't just be
walking around here

00:42.144 --> 00:43.745
with this emptiness
in your heart, man.

00:43.779 --> 00:48.081
An emptiness that can only
be filled by a brother.

00:49.582 --> 00:51.315
Okay.

00:51.349 --> 00:55.184
- Brothers, man?
- Brothers!

00:55.219 --> 00:57.152
- Get it in here, dog.
- Come over here.

00:57.186 --> 00:58.386
You got to get it in there,
dog.

00:58.421 --> 00:59.754
I got to tuck it, man.
(sighs)

00:59.788 --> 01:01.155
Tuck it, tuck it, tuck it.

01:01.189 --> 01:02.589
Brothers, man.

01:02.624 --> 01:03.824
Come here, man.

01:03.858 --> 01:05.859
Why the [bleep] you keep
following me around, man?

01:05.894 --> 01:08.128
Why don't you go home
and stay out of my room?

01:08.162 --> 01:09.429
Don't mess with my models.

01:09.463 --> 01:10.463
I'm about to get a wedgie up

01:10.497 --> 01:11.497

01:12.832 --> 01:13.831
Hey! Get the [bleep]
off me, man.

01:13.866 --> 01:15.666
Give me the wedgie-- Hey.

01:15.700 --> 01:17.700
Hey.

01:17.734 --> 01:20.259
You don't give a grown man
a wedgie.

01:21.636 --> 01:24.337
Mother[bleep],
I'm 34 years old.

01:25.643 --> 01:27.539

No results.

04:11.499 --> 04:14.401
Man, um,

04:14.435 --> 04:15.468
No, I'm just saying.

04:15.570 --> 04:18.870
"Pussy on the chain wax,"
It's not an expression.

Ye-- Yeah it is.

04:20.440 --> 04:21.539

05:04.773 --> 05:05.873

- Pussy on the chain wax!

05:05.908 --> 05:09.177
No one can put the pussy
on the chain wax

05:09.211 --> 05:12.180
'cause pussy on the chain wax
ain't a thing!

05:13.012 --> 05:14.582
You trying to start a thing,
aren't you?

05:14.617 --> 05:17.352

05:17.386 --> 05:20.722
I mean, what are you talking
about, trying to start a thing?

05:20.756 --> 05:23.258
A thing,
like "Off the hook"

05:23.292 --> 05:24.726
or "I'ma put you on blast."

05:24.760 --> 05:26.360
You trying to get it
in the ether,

05:26.395 --> 05:29.196
so everybody out there saying
"Pussy on the chain wax."

05:29.230 --> 05:30.697
Man, why are you

05:32.400 --> 05:34.267

and thing two

05:39.239 --> 05:41.340

Why do you care so much

05:59.155 --> 06:04.926

"pussy on the chain wax" or not?

06:08.497 --> 06:11.199
I lost my job.

06:13.202 --> 06:15.836
My girl left me.

06:17.805 --> 06:22.040
And all I w--
All I wanted to do

06:22.074 --> 06:27.410

08:36.457 --> 08:37.792

08:42.397 --> 08:44.231
whose sole character flaw
is that she cares too much!

08:44.265 --> 08:45.666
She cares too much!

08:45.701 --> 08:47.368
- It's that she cares too much!
- Yeah, she care too much!

08:47.402 --> 08:49.037
- Come on!
- Come on!

08:49.071 --> 08:50.538
You know
who they never be hating on?

08:50.572 --> 08:52.357
- Who's that, dog?
- Sandra Bullocksies.

08:52.377 --> 08:54.242
- Sandra Bullocksies.
- She's my girl,

08:54.276 --> 08:55.543
and they never be hating
on her.

08:55.578 --> 08:56.744
That's your girl right there.
Straight up there.

08:56.779 --> 08:58.112
Sandra Bullocksies
your girl right there.

08:58.147 --> 08:59.381
Straight up.

08:59.415 --> 09:00.882
Do you know who should
do a movie together, though?

09:00.916 --> 09:02.484
But who is that, dog?

09:02.518 --> 09:05.286
<i>Bullocksies and Hathaways</i>!

09:05.321 --> 09:06.921
You talking
about some Hathaway

09:06.956 --> 09:08.289
- and some Bullocksies?
- No!

09:08.324 --> 09:09.724
I'm talking
about some Bullocksies

09:09.759 --> 09:11.293
and some Hathaways!

09:11.327 --> 09:12.761
Let me just explain
what I'm talking about, though.

09:12.795 --> 09:16.732
I'm talking about some Hathaways
and some Bullocksies.

09:16.766 --> 09:17.800
No, you right.

09:17.834 --> 09:19.935
(both) Bullocksies.
Hathaways.

09:19.970 --> 09:25.474
That would be my [bleep]!

09:26.777 --> 09:30.213
Oh.

09:30.247 --> 09:31.981
- Oh, you good?
- Yeah, I-I'm good.

09:32.015 --> 09:33.149
I thought something
Was gonna...

09:33.183 --> 09:34.617
- Me too. so--
- happen for a second there.

09:34.651 --> 09:37.220
Figured we would transform
in some way,

09:37.254 --> 09:40.022
shape, or form.
Okay.

09:40.056 --> 09:42.958
That would be my [bleep]!

09:42.992 --> 09:48.130
(both)
That would be my [bleep]!

09:48.164 --> 09:52.668
(thunder)

09:52.703 --> 09:54.103
(laughter and applause)

09:54.137 --> 09:56.906
Who's the most dignified
black person in the world?

09:56.940 --> 09:58.641
Sidney Poitier.

09:58.675 --> 09:59.641
- Sidney.
- Sidney Poitier.

09:59.676 --> 10:00.943
Yeah. See? See?

10:00.977 --> 10:03.245
All I did was say his name,
and you start to clap.

10:03.279 --> 10:04.613
He is.

10:04.647 --> 10:06.648
He's the most graceful,
dignified man in the world.

10:06.682 --> 10:08.016
- Is who?
- Sidney Poitier.

10:08.050 --> 10:09.184
Okay.
Gotta give it up.

10:09.218 --> 10:11.253
Gotta give it up.
(applause)

10:11.287 --> 10:12.454
You know who's on his way,
though?

10:12.488 --> 10:14.290
- Morgan Freeman's on his way.
- Mm-hmm.

10:14.324 --> 10:16.959
He's on, like, second-tiered
super dignity status.

10:16.993 --> 10:18.094
(imitates Freeman)
"Morgan Freeman.

10:18.128 --> 10:19.695
"He's a frisky
little mother[bleep]."

10:19.730 --> 10:21.364
(laughter)

10:21.398 --> 10:23.066
Well, you see Morgan Freeman
in public.

10:23.100 --> 10:25.301
He's got, like,
a leather jacket and jeans.

10:25.335 --> 10:26.769
- Yeah.
- (laughs)

10:26.803 --> 10:28.504
(laughter)

10:28.538 --> 10:29.972
(imitates Freeman)
"I still got it."

10:30.007 --> 10:32.942
- (laughs)
- "Still got it."

10:35.879 --> 10:37.413
Hello, everyone.

10:37.448 --> 10:40.016
I'm Joseph Carmichael.

10:40.050 --> 10:46.022
Otis is-- was my father.

10:46.056 --> 10:49.425
But we are not here today
to mourn his death,

10:49.460 --> 10:51.594
but to celebrate his life.

10:51.629 --> 10:55.332
We knew Otis as a teacher,
a community leader,

10:55.366 --> 10:59.002
a role model, a husband,
and a father.

10:59.037 --> 11:01.004
Now, I thought
it would be nice

11:01.039 --> 11:04.408
to share something about him
y'all may not have known.

11:04.442 --> 11:06.043
When my father was younger,

11:06.077 --> 11:07.945
he was an actor
in Hollywood.

11:08.563 --> 11:10.214
Going through my dad's things,

11:10.248 --> 11:13.360
I found this reel of his work
as an actor.

11:14.119 --> 11:15.686
I haven't seen it yet,

11:15.720 --> 11:18.289
but I thought
it would be fun to watch,

11:18.323 --> 11:20.827
here with all of you today.

11:24.931 --> 11:26.765
Thank you.

11:36.475 --> 11:39.121
(gasps)
<b>Where are my pies?

11:40.246 --> 11:44.516
<i>Ribbles, where are the pies
I put on my windowsill?</i>

11:45.752 --> 11:49.343
<i>Why, I don't know,
Mrs. Caruthers.</i>

11:49.576 --> 11:51.701
<i>Why would anyone
want to steal</i>

11:51.763 --> 11:54.371
<i>one of your delicious
blueberry pies?</i>

11:58.322 --> 11:59.533
(snaps)
<i>Hey.</i>

11:59.567 --> 12:01.969
<i>See to it you shine
those shoes up nice, boy.</i>

12:02.201 --> 12:05.738
<i>Yes, sir,
you best be believing I will!</i>

12:05.773 --> 12:09.294
<i>I'll shine your shoes blacker
than my mama's booty.</i>

12:09.576 --> 12:11.310
(all gasp)

12:11.344 --> 12:14.946
(laughs)

12:20.350 --> 12:25.987
(yelling)

12:26.021 --> 12:27.288
<i>Ooga-booga!</i>

12:27.322 --> 12:29.289
<i>Ooga-booga shoo!
Ooga-booga shoo!</i>

12:29.323 --> 12:30.757
<i>- Ooga-booga!</i>
- Oh, hell no!

12:30.791 --> 12:33.359
<i>Ooga-booga shoo!
</i>(yelling)

12:52.513 --> 12:55.615
In 1964,
my father marched

12:55.649 --> 12:58.951
with Martin Luther King Jr.
and Harry Belafonte

12:58.986 --> 13:01.955
along with other renowned
civil rights leaders.

13:03.053 --> 13:04.920
(soul music)

13:05.838 --> 13:09.340
The big boss of any company
is always, like, super carefree.

13:09.691 --> 13:11.125
Right,
you got a cushy job.

13:11.159 --> 13:12.760
- You're-- You're the boss.
- Right.

13:12.794 --> 13:13.861
Those are the guys
walking around,

13:13.895 --> 13:14.895
"Hey.
How's everybody doing?

13:14.929 --> 13:16.897
(laughs)
"I'll be in my office."

13:16.931 --> 13:18.665
Yeah. Yeah.

13:18.700 --> 13:20.033
And my boss-- I used to work
at the theater in Chicago,

13:20.068 --> 13:21.334
called the Second City,

13:21.369 --> 13:22.969
and my boss used to do
this thing with me all the time.

13:23.003 --> 13:25.171
Hey.
Hey, what's going on?

13:25.205 --> 13:26.272
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.107
Oh.
(laughter)

13:28.141 --> 13:30.076
What are you up to?
What's going on?

13:30.110 --> 13:31.744
- Oh, just fi--
- Yeah.

13:31.778 --> 13:32.945
(laughter)

13:32.979 --> 13:35.214
Just, uh-- in the--
Oh!

13:35.248 --> 13:37.549
(laughter)

13:37.584 --> 13:38.951
You hanging in there?
Things are good?

13:38.985 --> 13:40.686
- I'm hanging in there, yeah.
- Things are good?

13:40.720 --> 13:43.022
Just been filing a sexual,
uh, harassment lawsuit.

13:43.056 --> 13:45.057
Oh, okay.

13:45.413 --> 13:46.413
(phone rings)

13:46.447 --> 13:47.981
Okay, all right.

13:48.015 --> 13:49.383
Good morning, Tom.

13:49.417 --> 13:51.017
Jason.

13:51.052 --> 13:52.318
How you doing there, Dave?

13:52.353 --> 13:54.287
Crystal, Tommy.

13:54.321 --> 13:55.688
Good morning, Jake.

13:55.723 --> 13:57.023
How are you?

13:57.057 --> 13:58.224
Pretty good, Kenny.

13:58.259 --> 13:59.325
Yeah, yeah.

13:59.844 --> 14:01.445
Uh, you know,
so early in the morning,

14:01.479 --> 14:03.581
I'm sorry to be
the bearer of bad news,

14:03.615 --> 14:05.450
but, uh, you know how I was

14:05.484 --> 14:07.485
- supposed to work late tonight?
- Mm-hmm.

14:07.520 --> 14:09.988
Well, I got to run this errand
for Mr. Mahina,

14:10.022 --> 14:11.957
and he says that you're gonna
have to cover for me,

14:11.991 --> 14:13.792
So there it is.
I don't nee-- I'm sorry.

14:13.826 --> 14:15.027
(whistles)
Dropped the ax.

14:15.061 --> 14:16.762
(laughs)
Okay, so--

14:16.796 --> 14:18.997
- Hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

14:19.031 --> 14:20.565
- Again.
- Yeah.

14:20.599 --> 14:23.400
So-- Oh, you know what?
(snaps)

14:23.435 --> 14:24.935
Just remembered.
(chuckles)

14:24.970 --> 14:27.771
Mr. Mahina also--
almost slipped my mind--

14:27.806 --> 14:29.807
wants us to, uh,
change parking spaces.

14:29.841 --> 14:31.175
What?

14:31.209 --> 14:32.743
Yeah.
M-Me personally?

14:32.778 --> 14:34.912
I enjoy
the nine-minute walk,

14:34.947 --> 14:36.647
But, uh, he said
that we have to do it.

14:36.682 --> 14:39.183
Believe it.
I hate it as much as you do.

14:39.218 --> 14:40.952
- What are you gonna do?
- Nothing you can do.

14:40.986 --> 14:42.153
If Mr. Mahina said it--

14:42.187 --> 14:43.821
- Mahina.
- (chuckles)

14:43.856 --> 14:45.356
This whole situation
has been Mahina-nized.

14:45.391 --> 14:47.625
It just seems
a little confusing to me

14:47.660 --> 14:49.860
as to why Mr. Mahina

14:49.895 --> 14:52.363
would give a [bleep]
where we park.

14:52.397 --> 14:53.831
How's that?

14:53.865 --> 14:57.735
I mean, why would he care
where we park?

14:57.770 --> 14:59.171
I-I don't know the answer
to that question.

14:59.205 --> 15:00.605
I-I mean, that's--
it's just what he said.

15:00.640 --> 15:03.041
He-- Hey, the Mahina works
in mysterious ways.

15:03.075 --> 15:04.876
You know what, I'm gonna
ask him myself 'cause--

15:04.910 --> 15:07.912
No, that's okay!
I'll do it!

15:14.053 --> 15:15.286
Uh, Mr. Mahina, sir,
I know you're busy,

15:15.321 --> 15:17.522
but can I speak to you
about the parking switch?

15:17.556 --> 15:19.123
<i>What's there to talk about,
Kenny?</i>

15:19.158 --> 15:22.394
<i>I told you and Jake
to switch parking spaces!</i>

15:22.428 --> 15:24.563
(gasps)
<i>Don't you know who I am?</i>

15:24.597 --> 15:26.899
<i>I am Mr. Mahina,</i>

15:26.933 --> 15:29.602
<i>And I'm a real,
real person in here!</i>

15:29.636 --> 15:32.672
<i>Get the hell
out of my office!</i>

15:34.942 --> 15:36.243
Wow.
Did you hear that?

15:36.277 --> 15:37.477
It was crazy in there.

15:37.511 --> 15:40.313
I mean, that was--
whew, tense.

15:40.348 --> 15:41.615
Yeah.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.784
You know
what's really crazy, though?

15:43.818 --> 15:45.185
Hmm?

15:45.219 --> 15:46.420
I've been working here
for about a year,

15:46.454 --> 15:48.889
and I've never even
<i>seen</i> Mr. Mahina.

15:48.923 --> 15:50.757
Well, see, now that's--
that's an easy one to answer.

15:50.792 --> 15:52.693
That's because he comes in
before you come into work,

15:52.727 --> 15:53.994
and he's still working
when you leave.

15:54.029 --> 15:55.062
That's-- That's what makes him
Mr. Mahina.

15:55.097 --> 15:56.330
You know, come on.
(laughs)

15:56.365 --> 15:58.065
We're talking
about Mr. Mahina here, right?

15:58.100 --> 15:59.300
(laughs)
It makes perfect sense.

15:59.334 --> 16:01.368
- You know, I bet...
- Mm-hmm.

16:01.402 --> 16:02.736
the hardworking boss

16:02.770 --> 16:06.306
would love to meet
a hardworking employee,

16:06.340 --> 16:08.208
uou know,
who shares the same values,

16:08.242 --> 16:11.444
so I'm gonna go ahead
and just introduce myself--

16:11.479 --> 16:13.246
No, no! Uh--
(laughs)

16:13.280 --> 16:14.681
You can't go
into Mr. Mahina's room.

16:14.715 --> 16:15.782
Are you crazy?

16:15.816 --> 16:16.816
No one except me
is allowed to go in there.

16:16.850 --> 16:19.085
Mr. Mahina is busy!

16:21.055 --> 16:24.324
Okay, fine.
You made your point clear, man.

16:24.358 --> 16:25.725
Thank you very much, Jake.
I think it's best--

16:25.760 --> 16:27.860
- And what--
- Wait, no, Jake! Wait, Jake!

16:27.894 --> 16:30.396
I can't--

16:30.430 --> 16:32.031
(scoffs)

16:32.065 --> 16:33.104
(sighs)

16:33.211 --> 16:35.746
Come on, man.

16:36.402 --> 16:41.306
What?
Question my existence, will you?

16:41.340 --> 16:43.996
(screams)

16:44.116 --> 16:45.118
<i>(sighs)</i>

16:45.180 --> 16:48.261
<i>...bucket creature?</i>

16:48.311 --> 16:49.536
<i>Listen to me.
The people...</i>

16:49.585 --> 16:51.699
I'll have the end of the year
report to you by 10.

16:53.959 --> 16:55.893
(soul music)

16:58.529 --> 17:00.230
Freeze!
Police.

17:00.265 --> 17:03.334
Hands up.

17:03.368 --> 17:06.436
Turn around slowly.

17:10.876 --> 17:12.910
Okay, buddy.

17:12.944 --> 17:15.980
Do not move a muscle.

17:20.419 --> 17:21.453
Up! Up!

17:21.487 --> 17:22.454
Get your hands back up.

17:22.489 --> 17:24.156
No, raise them.

17:24.190 --> 17:26.391
Up, hands up, now!

17:28.528 --> 17:30.329
No, no m-- Stop!

17:30.363 --> 17:31.497
I said no moving.

17:31.531 --> 17:33.765
Put your foot down.

17:34.968 --> 17:36.101
That's good.

17:36.136 --> 17:37.503
Now, easy does it.
No!

17:37.537 --> 17:38.837
Don't pick
your other foot up!

17:38.872 --> 17:41.207
Put that down.
Put your foot down!

17:41.241 --> 17:43.976
Put your foot down.
There we go.

17:44.011 --> 17:45.378
No, do not
pick the other one up.

17:45.412 --> 17:47.146
Put that one down.

17:47.181 --> 17:48.948
Put your foot down.
No, not--

17:48.982 --> 17:50.250
Put them both down
at the sa-- Okay.

17:50.284 --> 17:52.785
Now you're just walking.
Stop walking!

17:52.820 --> 17:54.120
Now!

17:54.155 --> 17:55.522
St-- No walking!

17:55.556 --> 17:57.958
I want you to stop walking
right now.

17:57.992 --> 17:58.992
