WEBVTT

00:05.296 --> 00:06.548
My name is Bridget.

00:06.589 --> 00:08.341
I witnessed a murder.

00:08.383 --> 00:10.468
Just get up on the stand
and tell the judge
what you saw,

00:10.510 --> 00:11.720
and we'll protect you.

00:11.761 --> 00:14.055
BRIDGET:
I know. Jimmy's got my back.

00:14.097 --> 00:16.182
I thought I'd be safe.
Turns out I was wrong.

00:16.224 --> 00:18.101
JIMMY: You testify against
him tomorrow, you're dead.

00:18.143 --> 00:20.186
-You can't trust the Feds.
-I can trust you?

00:20.228 --> 00:22.689
I'm not asking you to trust
me, I'm asking you to run.

00:22.731 --> 00:25.108
BRIDGET: I ran to
my sister Siobhan for help.

00:25.150 --> 00:27.986
Siobhan killed herself,
and I assumed her identity.

00:28.028 --> 00:32.032
It was so easy. I saw a way out,
and I took it.

00:32.073 --> 00:34.576
I'm in labor. I need
to get to the hospital.

00:34.617 --> 00:36.870
You did great.

00:36.911 --> 00:39.247
Siobhan, the girls
are so beautiful.

00:39.289 --> 00:40.832
-You asked to see me?
-Yeah.

00:40.874 --> 00:43.877
I want
a paternity test.

00:43.918 --> 00:49.924

00:49.966 --> 00:51.968

01:14.449 --> 01:16.409
You look beautiful.

01:16.451 --> 01:18.119
Thank you.

01:18.161 --> 01:21.831
Your union has withstood
more than its fair share

01:21.873 --> 01:24.417
of trials
and tribulations...

01:24.459 --> 01:28.713
and yet, here you stand today,
more in love than ever.

01:30.590 --> 01:32.717
-Hey.
-Oh, thanks.

01:34.469 --> 01:39.849
I, Andrew Martin,
pledge myself to you.

01:39.891 --> 01:43.520
I promise to love,

01:43.561 --> 01:46.022
honor, and cherish you.

01:48.983 --> 01:50.819
I...

01:52.445 --> 01:55.156
Siobhan Martin...

01:57.492 --> 02:00.286
pledge myself to you.

02:00.328 --> 02:02.872
I promise to honor

02:02.914 --> 02:07.001
and love
and cherish you.

02:07.043 --> 02:10.630
[applause]

02:21.808 --> 02:23.810
[jazz music playing]

02:26.646 --> 02:28.523
Break it up, you two.
Congratulations.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.817
Thank you. Thank you
for all your help.

02:30.859 --> 02:32.485
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

02:48.543 --> 02:50.253
[gasps]

03:02.390 --> 03:06.686
I can't believe I
finally got my one-year chip.

03:06.728 --> 03:10.315
Felt like it took 20.

03:10.356 --> 03:15.403
I-I wouldn't have gotten this
without my sponsor, Malcolm.

03:15.445 --> 03:17.989
And this is because of him.

03:20.241 --> 03:22.327
When I was using, I didn't

03:22.368 --> 03:24.954
care about anything.

03:24.996 --> 03:28.708
And I didn't mean anything
to anyone.

03:31.586 --> 03:33.546
In the last seven months,
I really learned to

03:33.588 --> 03:35.757
let people in.

03:35.798 --> 03:38.843
And they'd let me in.

03:38.885 --> 03:41.137
Feels good to say that...

03:41.179 --> 03:43.556
life is good.

03:43.598 --> 03:47.268
And I'm walking down
the aisle in less than a week.

03:47.310 --> 03:48.978
Technically, it's a vow renewal.

03:49.020 --> 03:53.233
But it feels
like the first time.

03:53.274 --> 03:56.152
Just my husband
and my stepdaughter

03:56.194 --> 04:01.407
in, uh, Turks and Caicos.

04:01.449 --> 04:03.618
But before I do, I...

04:03.660 --> 04:05.578
I have to tell them
my secret.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.789
Just remember...

04:07.830 --> 04:10.833
when you come clean,
you stay clean.

04:10.875 --> 04:15.713
Which is why I am going
to tell them tonight.

04:15.755 --> 04:18.007
I'm finally going to
tell my family

04:18.049 --> 04:21.386
who I really am.

04:33.648 --> 04:36.276
Do you have any idea
what you stand to lose?

04:36.317 --> 04:39.487
My family.
My sobriety.

04:39.529 --> 04:41.030
Your life.

04:41.072 --> 04:44.826
You're finally
safe as Siobhan.

04:44.867 --> 04:46.202
Don't get me wrong,
I think it's great

04:46.244 --> 04:48.037
that you want to
be honest but...

04:48.079 --> 04:50.039
outing yourself
as Bridget Kelly is

04:50.081 --> 04:51.624
not the smartest move.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.835
Bodaway wants her dead,
not Siobhan Martin.

04:53.876 --> 04:55.795
I know what
the risks are.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.213
But they don't
outweigh the damage

04:57.255 --> 04:59.549
that I am doing to
the two people that I love.

04:59.590 --> 05:01.426
I made up my mind.

05:01.467 --> 05:04.053
I can't walk down that aisle
until I tell them.

05:04.095 --> 05:05.638
Do you really think
there's gonna be

05:05.680 --> 05:07.640
an aisle to walk down,
once you tell Andrew?

05:10.143 --> 05:11.644
I don't know.

05:15.565 --> 05:20.028
[sighs] I never knew it would
be this hard to sign my name.

05:20.069 --> 05:22.447
I don't know how to
thank you, Tim.

05:22.488 --> 05:24.615
This buy out is
saving Martin/Charles.

05:24.657 --> 05:27.702
I'm a businessman,
Andrew. Not a saint.

05:27.744 --> 05:31.456
My advisors are calling
it a tax write-off.

05:31.497 --> 05:34.250
Well, regardless of
your intentions...

05:34.292 --> 05:36.085
I'm indebted to you.

05:36.127 --> 05:38.212
Damn right you are.

05:40.715 --> 05:43.092
Tim, it's nice to see you.

05:43.134 --> 05:45.428
Lovely to see you, too.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.305
Am I interrupting?
I can go.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.973
No. Not at all.

05:49.015 --> 05:50.558
We were just,
uh, finishing up.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.143
Is everything all right?

05:52.185 --> 05:53.853
Yeah... yeah I, um,

05:53.895 --> 05:55.521
I wanted to make sure you'd
be home for dinner tonight.

05:55.563 --> 05:57.106
I'm going to cook.

05:57.148 --> 05:58.900
Really?
What's the occasion?

05:58.941 --> 06:01.235
No occasion.
Just 'cause.

06:01.277 --> 06:02.820
Isn't that
sweet?

06:02.862 --> 06:04.989
Uh, did I mention
we're renewing our vows?

06:07.241 --> 06:10.286
I know you were sleeping
with Siobhan Martin.

06:10.328 --> 06:11.913
I'm going to
destroy you.

06:11.954 --> 06:15.375
I will make you
and Siobhan pay
for what you did.

06:17.043 --> 06:20.338
Congratulations
to you both.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.132
I should get going.

06:23.174 --> 06:24.550
Take care, Siobhan.

06:24.592 --> 06:25.927
You too, Tim.

06:28.012 --> 06:29.555
I think Mr. Arbogast

06:29.597 --> 06:31.307
might be a little
more apropos,

06:31.349 --> 06:33.434
seeing that he is
my boss.

06:33.476 --> 06:36.479
Andrew, I know that this
is less than ideal, but...

06:36.521 --> 06:37.980
It's better than
the alternative, I know.

06:38.022 --> 06:39.524
This way, he's saving
my investors

06:39.565 --> 06:41.943
from financial ruin
and me from jail.

06:41.984 --> 06:43.611
No offense,

06:43.653 --> 06:46.280
but I don't think you
would fare too well in jail.

06:46.322 --> 06:47.490
Heh heh.

06:47.532 --> 06:49.117
And besides,

06:49.158 --> 06:51.160
I couldn't stand to be away
from you for that long.

06:51.202 --> 06:53.037
Conjugal visits
would not cut it.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.039
[chuckles]

06:55.081 --> 06:58.626
You know, I'm so
grateful to be given
a second chance.

06:58.668 --> 07:01.045
Sometimes I feel
I don't deserve it.

07:01.087 --> 07:04.590
Everyone deserves
a second chance, right?

07:13.099 --> 07:14.350
Hey.

07:16.018 --> 07:17.478
What did
the doctor say?

07:17.520 --> 07:18.771
They're doing beautifully.

07:18.813 --> 07:20.356
They'll be ready to
leave next week.

07:20.398 --> 07:21.983
I mean, we got to
sign this first, though.

07:22.024 --> 07:23.651
Which means the girls are
finally ready

07:23.693 --> 07:25.194
for some names.

07:25.236 --> 07:28.072
You settle on any?

07:28.114 --> 07:30.074
Portia and Regan.

07:30.116 --> 07:31.701
[laughs]
Come on, Siobhan.

07:31.742 --> 07:33.035
I was thinking more
"Franny and Zooey,"

07:33.077 --> 07:34.829
a little less
Shakespearean tragedy.

07:37.331 --> 07:39.584
Uh...

07:39.625 --> 07:41.586
Look, I gotta go pick
the boys up from school.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.171
But, before I go,

07:43.212 --> 07:44.881
I wanted to talk to you
about something.

07:44.922 --> 07:47.592
I want to move to Chicago.

07:47.633 --> 07:49.677
You said you were
ready to leave.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.220
You said that we could take
the money you stole

07:51.262 --> 07:53.347
from Martin/Charles
and go anywhere that I want.

07:53.389 --> 07:56.225
And I want to go to Chicago
to be close to my family.

07:56.267 --> 07:58.811
Sounds like you've
already made up
your mind.

07:58.853 --> 08:01.606
Look, I'm just,

08:01.647 --> 08:04.734
I'm just done
with all of this.

08:04.775 --> 08:06.319
The lies, the scheming.

08:06.360 --> 08:08.029
I need to get away
from it all.

08:08.070 --> 08:09.822
Henry, I have
two little girls

08:09.864 --> 08:12.033
in intensive care.

08:12.074 --> 08:14.118
The only thing that
I've done is lose sleep.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.953
There's no scheming
on my end.

08:15.995 --> 08:18.956
But the fact is, you
still hate your sister.

08:18.998 --> 08:20.583
And you said you'd be willing

08:20.625 --> 08:22.210
to give up on revenge
if it meant losing me,

08:22.251 --> 08:25.046
but I have a hard time
believing that.

08:25.087 --> 08:27.131
You wanted Andrew
to kill Bridget,

08:27.173 --> 08:28.424
thinking that she was you.

08:28.466 --> 08:30.259
But you were wrong
about Andrew.

08:30.301 --> 08:32.011
He didn't want you
dead, so...

08:32.053 --> 08:34.972
what if you were
wrong about Bridget?

08:35.014 --> 08:38.392
I mean, is she really
to blame for Sean?

08:38.434 --> 08:39.894
You've got to start
giving people

08:39.936 --> 08:41.187
the benefit of the doubt.

08:41.229 --> 08:42.855
I've got my boys back.

08:42.897 --> 08:44.857
And the only thing that is
keeping me in New York

08:44.899 --> 08:46.442
is you.

08:46.484 --> 08:48.653
And the only thing that's
keeping you here

08:48.694 --> 08:52.281
is your vendetta
against Bridget, so...

08:52.323 --> 08:55.576
sweetheart, if we
are going to move on,

08:55.618 --> 08:57.411
you gotta move on.

09:01.916 --> 09:03.417
MACHADO: Agent Wiegler,
you wanted to see me?

09:03.459 --> 09:05.294
WIEGLER: Thanks to all
that hard work you did

09:05.336 --> 09:08.798
in New York, you're back
on active duty.

09:08.839 --> 09:10.466
But it comes
with a condition.

09:10.508 --> 09:14.011
Vic, you're too good of an
agent to be suspended again.

09:14.053 --> 09:15.846
So, effective immediately,
you're

09:15.888 --> 09:17.890
off the Bodaway Macawi
case for good.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.517
No offense, Royce.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.686
I made a promise to
put Bodaway behind bars.

09:21.727 --> 09:23.229
If I just have
a little more time...

09:23.271 --> 09:24.689
I'm sorry, but did I give
you the impression

09:24.730 --> 09:27.441
that this was up
for discussion?

09:27.483 --> 09:29.360
Look, we've tried
doing it your way.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.736
I made allowances
because I know

09:30.778 --> 09:32.697
your connection
with the victim.

09:32.738 --> 09:34.240
I reassigned you
under Torrance,

09:34.282 --> 09:35.866
hoping that he was gonna
rein you in.

09:35.908 --> 09:38.369
But we both know how
that ended, now, don't we?

09:38.411 --> 09:40.288
You almost got
arrested, Vic.

09:40.329 --> 09:42.248
Now you have
a choice:

09:42.290 --> 09:44.125
Starting today, either
you sever all ties

09:44.166 --> 09:45.835
with Bodaway Macawi...

09:45.876 --> 09:48.212
or you find yourself
another job.

09:57.179 --> 10:01.225
JIMMY: Hi, Siobhan.

10:01.267 --> 10:03.394
Bet you thought you'd
never see me again.

10:12.194 --> 10:15.239
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:15.281 --> 10:18.242
Oh, I'm not here
to hurt you.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.161
Really?

10:20.202 --> 10:21.370
'Cause last I heard,
you were serving

10:21.412 --> 10:22.830
a life sentence for murder.

10:22.872 --> 10:25.166
Yeah, well,
Christmas came early.

10:27.918 --> 10:29.462
What do you want
from me?

10:29.503 --> 10:31.547
Well, it's not
what I want,

10:31.589 --> 10:32.757
it's what Bodaway wants.

10:35.343 --> 10:38.387
Well, I'm sorry, but I
can't help you with that.

10:38.429 --> 10:40.181
I don't know
where Bridget is.

10:40.222 --> 10:41.974
The last I heard
from her was September.

10:42.016 --> 10:43.559
To tell you the truth,

10:43.601 --> 10:45.311
I don't give a rat's ass
where she is.

10:45.353 --> 10:47.188
The plan's changed.

10:47.229 --> 10:49.273
I'm sick of being
Bodaway's bitch.

10:49.315 --> 10:52.276
So, why are you
coming to me?

10:52.318 --> 10:55.071
'Cause you're
going to pay me,

10:55.112 --> 10:58.491
just like last time.

10:58.532 --> 11:01.535
...eventually acquitted of the
murder of his younger brother...

11:09.418 --> 11:10.795
Hey.

11:10.836 --> 11:14.340
Can I get a whiskey
and a beer, please?

11:14.382 --> 11:15.925
This Bodaway trial is

11:15.966 --> 11:18.177
all this town's
talking about, huh?

11:18.219 --> 11:19.845
Name is John, by the way.

11:19.887 --> 11:22.223
I'm not from here,
obviously.

11:22.264 --> 11:24.308
Thank you.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.560
You know where a guy
can get a good steak?

11:26.602 --> 11:28.437
This ain't "Brokeback
Mountain," pal.

11:28.479 --> 11:30.356
You want some action,
go two towns over

11:30.398 --> 11:32.566
to the Circle Bar.

11:32.608 --> 11:34.610
I'm not hitting
on you, buddy.

11:34.652 --> 11:37.113
Actually, more like
hitting you up.

11:37.154 --> 11:39.240
I got a job for you.

11:39.281 --> 11:41.033
You're guarding
Bridget Kelly, right?

11:41.075 --> 11:42.785
Word on the ranch is

11:42.827 --> 11:45.621
her safety's not
exactly your priority.

11:45.663 --> 11:47.373
And I've got
an inside source that says

11:47.415 --> 11:49.041
you're working
for Bodaway Macawi.

11:49.083 --> 11:50.751
But I could pay you double.

11:53.504 --> 11:55.423
I'm not working
for anyone.

11:55.464 --> 11:57.174
And even if I was,

11:57.216 --> 11:58.801
you couldn't afford me.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.386
But I can.

12:00.428 --> 12:01.887
Bridget, what
are you doing here?

12:01.929 --> 12:03.889
It's Siobhan.

12:03.931 --> 12:05.725
I'm the good twin.

12:05.766 --> 12:07.143
And I'll cut right
to the chase

12:07.184 --> 12:08.644
so John here doesn't
talk your ear off.

12:08.686 --> 12:10.479
You're going to
scare Bridget
into running.

12:10.521 --> 12:12.106
Actually, you're
going to scare her

12:12.148 --> 12:13.858
into running to me.

12:13.899 --> 12:15.776
And for that, I will
pay you double.

12:15.818 --> 12:17.695
Fine. Triple,
if I have to.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.071
But you're not
leaving this bar

12:19.113 --> 12:20.740
until you say yes.

12:24.618 --> 12:25.828
You OK?

12:25.870 --> 12:27.455
Yeah.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.291
It's just a lot.

12:30.332 --> 12:33.461
Well, looks like
you're doing all right.

12:33.502 --> 12:35.671
50 K's a drop
in the bucket for you.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.840
But it's plenty
to make me disappear.

12:37.882 --> 12:39.842
Why should I pay you
one cent?

12:39.884 --> 12:42.386
You're an escaped convict.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.305
All I have to do is
call the authorities
and turn you in.

12:44.346 --> 12:46.474
Last I checked,
911 was free.

12:46.515 --> 12:49.268
Yeah...

12:49.310 --> 12:53.105
but that would end up
costing you a lot more.

12:53.147 --> 12:56.609
See, not only does
Bodaway not know I
was working for you;

12:56.650 --> 13:00.112
he doesn't know
that Bridget had a twin.

13:00.154 --> 13:02.948
If you refuse to pay,

13:02.990 --> 13:05.659
I got to keep working
for Bodaway.

13:05.701 --> 13:07.995
Which means I got to
find your sister.

13:08.037 --> 13:09.246
And since nobody's
got a damn clue

13:09.288 --> 13:11.415
as to where she is,

13:11.457 --> 13:15.252
I could always
tell Bodaway
that you're Bridget.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.804
[footsteps]

13:26.597 --> 13:27.765
Hey.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.433
What's going on here?

13:29.475 --> 13:32.561
Um, I'm packing
for Chicago.

13:32.603 --> 13:34.688
I figure, once
the girls get released

13:34.730 --> 13:36.273
from the hospital
and the doctors

13:36.315 --> 13:38.567
give them the OK
to get on a plane,

13:38.609 --> 13:41.445
then we'll come
and meet you,

13:41.487 --> 13:43.364
if that's still OK.

13:43.405 --> 13:45.741
If it's still OK?
It's better than OK.

13:45.783 --> 13:47.159
That's great!

13:47.201 --> 13:48.369
I mean, you know,
it's not New York,

13:48.410 --> 13:50.371
but you're going to
love Chicago.

13:50.412 --> 13:52.456
Mmm. Well, we can see
about that one.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.542
I just... I'm ready
for us to be together

13:54.583 --> 13:56.669
and move on
with our life.

13:59.004 --> 14:00.756
You know, my sister has
been sending me listings,

14:00.798 --> 14:02.591
and she found a place
that she really loves.

14:02.633 --> 14:04.552
It's on the lake.

14:04.593 --> 14:06.387
It's near good schools
and museums.

14:06.428 --> 14:08.973
And each kid
can have their own room.

14:09.014 --> 14:12.476
I mean, the only thing is,
it's out of my price range.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.979
I thought we were buying
this house together.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.776
You have no idea
what that means

14:20.818 --> 14:22.528
to hear you say that, but...

14:22.570 --> 14:24.196
I mean, I...
I don't know

14:24.238 --> 14:25.739
how long it's going to take
to sell this place,

14:25.781 --> 14:27.408
and there's just
a lot of stuff

14:27.449 --> 14:29.493
to work out
before we buy anything.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.787
No. Not if I give
you the money

14:31.829 --> 14:34.623
for the down payment.

14:34.665 --> 14:37.376
Ha ha! You don't even know
what the asking price is.

14:37.418 --> 14:39.211
Come on. I'm doing
what you said.

14:39.253 --> 14:41.505
I'm giving the benefit
of the doubt.

14:41.547 --> 14:45.885
I just want us all to be
together--as a family.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.226
All right, so what
do you want first?

14:54.268 --> 14:56.145
The bad news
or the worse news?

14:56.186 --> 14:58.689
Those are my only
two options?

14:58.731 --> 15:00.190
All right, give
me the bad first.

15:00.232 --> 15:01.817
An unidentified body
was discovered in Hoboken.

15:01.859 --> 15:03.652
Uh, there's no DNA
or dental records yet,

15:03.694 --> 15:05.696
but the face structure scan
and bone proportion

15:05.738 --> 15:08.908
suggest it
could be Malcolm Ward.

15:08.949 --> 15:10.451
Now, I know it's
probably not a shock

15:10.492 --> 15:12.536
after finding his wallet
on Daniel Eknath's body,

15:12.578 --> 15:14.788
but still...
I'm really sorry.

15:14.830 --> 15:16.749
Yeah, me, too.

15:16.790 --> 15:18.834
Well, if that's
the bad news, what's worse?

15:22.713 --> 15:25.257
Jimmy Kemper escaped
from prison yesterday.

15:25.299 --> 15:27.051
I figured you'd
want to know,

15:27.092 --> 15:28.302
considering you
were the one

15:28.344 --> 15:30.054
who put the guy
behind bars.

15:32.348 --> 15:34.016
ANDREW [laughing]:
Right.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.809
"So long, suckers!"

15:35.851 --> 15:37.478
-"Sucker!"
-That's what he said.

15:37.519 --> 15:38.854
"S-Sucker."
Your mouth goes to
the side like that.

15:38.896 --> 15:40.272
-"Sucker."

15:40.314 --> 15:41.857
It's true.

15:41.899 --> 15:44.068
Those were his words,
not mine.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.654
Rough day?

15:46.695 --> 15:49.490
Oh, um...sorry.

15:49.531 --> 15:51.075
It was a bit hectic.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.493
Well, all you have
to do now is sit back

15:52.534 --> 15:54.703
and enjoy this delicious
meal you prepared.

15:54.745 --> 15:56.747
Actually, there's,
uh, something

15:56.789 --> 15:58.415
I wanted to talk
to you both about.

15:58.457 --> 15:59.875
JULIET:
Oh, my God.

15:59.917 --> 16:01.710
Oh, my God,
you guys.

16:01.752 --> 16:03.045
Andrea's boyfriend
just broke up
with her on a text.

16:03.087 --> 16:04.922
I have-I have to
go call her.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.340
Juliet, sit.

16:07.925 --> 16:10.552
That was rude.

16:10.594 --> 16:13.639
Which I guess means
she's doing better.

16:13.681 --> 16:16.308
Therapy
was a good idea.

16:16.350 --> 16:17.726
And vacation.

16:17.768 --> 16:19.687
The most needed trip
of the year.

16:19.728 --> 16:21.063
Andrew...

16:21.105 --> 16:22.815
Actually, I'm glad it's just

16:22.856 --> 16:24.108
the two of us,
'cause there's something

16:24.149 --> 16:26.610
I wanted to share
with you, as well.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.988
Do you mind
if I go first?

16:29.029 --> 16:30.698
No. Go ahead.

16:30.739 --> 16:32.282
[chuckles]

16:36.286 --> 16:38.831
I've been working
on my vows.

16:38.872 --> 16:41.875
I know the first time
around, we just...

16:41.917 --> 16:43.711
repeated "I do,"
but this is different.

16:43.752 --> 16:46.630
I wanted to say
something special.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.551
I found a poem,

16:50.592 --> 16:52.678
"Marriage Song."

16:52.720 --> 16:55.097
May I read you a bit?

16:55.139 --> 16:56.932
Of course.

17:00.060 --> 17:02.730
"There is my dove,
my loved one.

17:02.771 --> 17:05.899
"None with her can compare.

17:05.941 --> 17:07.901
"Her beauty shames
the day-star

17:07.943 --> 17:09.778
"and makes the darkness
light.

17:09.820 --> 17:12.197
"Day in her
radiant presence

17:12.239 --> 17:14.742
grows seven times
more bright."

17:14.783 --> 17:18.370
When I found it, I knew
I was reading about you.

17:20.789 --> 17:22.583
For the rest
of our lives,

17:22.624 --> 17:25.210
I promise to find you
in every poem,

17:25.252 --> 17:29.798
to see you in every
work of art,

17:29.840 --> 17:31.592
to hear you
in every love song.

17:35.137 --> 17:38.974
I'm amazed by the power you
have over my heart, Siobhan.

17:45.397 --> 17:47.399
I, uh, can't get over...

17:49.485 --> 17:52.613
how you've stuck by me
through everything.

17:52.654 --> 17:55.199
[sighs]

17:55.240 --> 17:57.785
You've made me
a better man,

17:57.826 --> 17:59.620
and I just hope
that I can continue

17:59.661 --> 18:01.497
to be the husband
that you deserve.

18:03.248 --> 18:06.251
It's beautiful.

18:06.293 --> 18:09.129
Thank you.

18:09.171 --> 18:11.381
Now it's your turn.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.010
I...

18:18.764 --> 18:21.433
After that, it can wait.

18:36.698 --> 18:38.075
[gasps]

18:38.117 --> 18:40.744
Going somewhere?

18:40.786 --> 18:42.704
What are you doing here?

18:42.746 --> 18:44.498
Had you followed.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.458
Didn't think you
could be trusted.

18:49.044 --> 18:51.755
Guess I was right.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.715
I'm a fugitive,
remember?

18:53.757 --> 18:54.925
Wanted for two murders
I didn't commit

18:54.967 --> 18:56.343
because I was
covering your ass.

18:56.385 --> 18:58.679
I got no choice but to run.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.305
But I thought we had
a deal, Jimmy.

19:00.347 --> 19:02.015
We do.

19:02.057 --> 19:03.350
We do, and I'm...
I'm honoring it.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.310
Look, I...
I found Bridget, all right?

19:05.352 --> 19:07.396
She's... she's here.
She's in New York.

19:07.437 --> 19:09.022
And she must have
found a sugar daddy

19:09.064 --> 19:10.941
'cause the bitch is
living the-the high life

19:10.983 --> 19:14.403
over on Park Avenue
going by the name
of Siobhan...unh!

19:16.572 --> 19:17.865
Martin.

19:17.906 --> 19:20.200
[whispering]
Yeah... yeah...

19:24.538 --> 19:26.456
I'm one step
ahead of you.

19:46.351 --> 19:48.979
When you told me
that Kemper made you run,

19:49.021 --> 19:50.355
I never would have guessed

19:50.397 --> 19:52.316
that your sister
and Delario were behind it.

19:52.357 --> 19:54.276
It just doesn't
make any sense.

19:54.318 --> 19:56.278
Why would Siobhan
pay someone

19:56.320 --> 19:58.530
to make
me run to her

19:58.572 --> 20:00.490
only to kill herself
a few days later?

20:00.532 --> 20:03.118
I don't know,
but I did some digging.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.953
Cop buddy of mine slipped
me John Delario's file.

20:04.995 --> 20:06.496
Turns out there's
a record of him

20:06.538 --> 20:08.582
being in the Hamptons
September 8.

20:08.624 --> 20:09.958
He had lunch
with your sister--

20:10.000 --> 20:11.835
a long lunch--
at Tipton's Reef.

20:11.877 --> 20:13.212
They talked for hours,

20:13.253 --> 20:14.922
and they left together
in his car.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.884
So they were
still in contact.

20:18.926 --> 20:20.677
Yeah. I'm gonna head up
to the Hamptons later

20:20.719 --> 20:22.095
and see what else
I can dig up.

20:22.137 --> 20:24.973
In the meantime,
I want you to take this.

20:25.015 --> 20:26.475
No, I don't like guns.

20:26.516 --> 20:28.268
You have to
protect yourself.

20:28.310 --> 20:29.519
I don't like the idea
of you and Kemper

20:29.561 --> 20:31.104
running around
in the same city.

20:31.146 --> 20:32.397
Kemper's long gone by
now. Really, it's not--

20:32.439 --> 20:33.607
What?

20:33.649 --> 20:35.651
Necessary?

20:35.692 --> 20:37.778
If memory serves, the last
time you turned down a gun,

20:37.819 --> 20:39.404
it ended up
saving your life.

20:40.489 --> 20:42.157
OK. Thank you.

20:44.159 --> 20:45.661
It's pretty quiet
around here.

20:45.702 --> 20:47.829
Is that a good thing?

20:47.871 --> 20:49.748
I haven't told them.

20:49.790 --> 20:51.792
I was going to
last night,

20:51.833 --> 20:55.712
and then Andrew
read me his vows.

20:55.754 --> 20:58.674
That pedestal
he puts me on, it...

20:58.715 --> 21:02.094
it's a long way to fall.

21:02.135 --> 21:04.930
But I... I know that
you're right.

21:04.972 --> 21:08.433
This isn't a fantasy;
it's real life.

21:08.475 --> 21:12.729
And when I do tell them,
it'll be over.

21:12.771 --> 21:14.940
So what are you
going to do?

21:16.400 --> 21:18.277
I'm still going
to tell them.

21:18.318 --> 21:20.821
Tonight.

21:20.862 --> 21:23.490
At your
going-away party?

21:23.532 --> 21:26.285
After.

21:26.326 --> 21:28.912
I want one last night
of the fantasy.

21:40.674 --> 21:44.052
Hey. What's that?

21:44.094 --> 21:46.430
You had
a paternity test done?

21:50.434 --> 21:52.561
You were sleeping
with Tyler.

21:52.602 --> 21:55.689
I needed to know
if the twins were mine.

21:55.731 --> 21:57.065
Look, Siobhan,

21:57.107 --> 21:58.859
we're going to start
a new life together,

21:58.900 --> 22:00.277
and I want to trust you.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.820
I really do.

22:03.822 --> 22:06.450
What's it say?

22:06.491 --> 22:09.494
What I knew it
would always say.

22:09.536 --> 22:11.413
The girls are yours.

22:11.455 --> 22:13.915
[chuckles]

22:16.293 --> 22:18.170
Thank you.

22:18.211 --> 22:20.672
You just made
a hard decision
very easy for me.

22:37.689 --> 22:39.816
I'll be reachable
by cell and e-mail.

22:39.858 --> 22:42.402
And Claudine has all the
contact info for the resort

22:42.444 --> 22:43.820
just in case.

22:43.862 --> 22:45.072
Have a safe trip.

22:45.113 --> 22:47.491
Thank you.

22:47.532 --> 22:49.659
You know,
I'm a lucky man, Tim.

22:49.701 --> 22:54.247
I get to marry the woman
of my dreams twice.

22:54.289 --> 22:56.166
Andrew, wait.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.919
There's one other thing.

22:58.960 --> 23:02.881
I didn't really know
if it was my place,

23:02.923 --> 23:05.342
but I can't be a hypocrite.

23:05.384 --> 23:10.514
I attacked you
for your dishonesty,

23:10.555 --> 23:12.724
but now I need
to tell you the truth.

23:20.565 --> 23:22.359
GREER: I haven't seen
Andrew around.

23:22.401 --> 23:23.902
-Is he hiding someplace?
-Oh, he's coming from work.

23:23.944 --> 23:25.195
He said he might be
a bit late.

23:25.237 --> 23:27.531
Speak of the devil.

23:27.572 --> 23:30.158
I just found out
that everything
between us is a lie.

23:31.701 --> 23:32.953
Excuse me?

23:32.994 --> 23:35.080
I know about
the affair with Henry.

23:37.290 --> 23:39.543
JULIET: Um, guys,
what's going on?

23:42.754 --> 23:44.965
I am not having
an affair with Henry.

23:45.006 --> 23:47.050
But you were...
for over a year.

23:47.092 --> 23:48.718
Don't even try
to deny it.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.554
Arbogast told me
everything.

23:50.595 --> 23:52.055
How he hired a private
investigator.

23:52.097 --> 23:54.683
Showed me phone records,
hotel receipts.

23:54.724 --> 23:56.017
Do you guys need
some privacy?

23:56.059 --> 23:57.561
I-I can ask the guests
to leave.

23:57.602 --> 23:59.020
I think that's
a great idea.

23:59.062 --> 24:00.272
Because there
aren't gonna be

24:00.313 --> 24:01.898
any nuptials
to celebrate.

24:01.940 --> 24:04.568
[guests murmuring]

24:04.609 --> 24:07.112
This marriage
is over.

24:09.156 --> 24:11.199
Daddy, Dad, Dad, wait.

24:19.666 --> 24:22.210
Henry?

24:22.252 --> 24:23.920
How much was
that down payment?

24:23.962 --> 24:27.591
Uh, I didn't put down
the payment.

24:27.632 --> 24:30.844
My balance is drained.

24:30.886 --> 24:32.554
Somebody must have
hacked into my account.

24:32.596 --> 24:34.389
Bridget did it last time,

24:34.431 --> 24:36.016
but there's no way that she
would know about this one.

24:38.977 --> 24:40.812
Bridget didn't steal
from you.

24:42.814 --> 24:44.608
I did.

24:46.193 --> 24:47.694
What?

24:47.736 --> 24:49.404
I wanted to take away

24:49.446 --> 24:51.281
the one thing that meant
something to you.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.116
You know, kind of like
you took away everything

24:53.158 --> 24:55.035
that meant
anything to me.

24:56.369 --> 24:57.871
I don't understand.

24:57.913 --> 24:59.831
I grew anxious,

24:59.873 --> 25:03.919
and so I called the hospital
about the paternity test.

25:03.960 --> 25:06.838
I knew the results before
you opened the letter.

25:08.840 --> 25:11.218
All that talk
to me about honesty,

25:11.259 --> 25:13.011
and you were lying?

25:13.053 --> 25:14.387
The test

25:14.429 --> 25:16.181
was a test!

25:16.223 --> 25:18.350
I wanted to see how you
would handle the truth.

25:18.391 --> 25:20.894
Because the funny thing
is I could handle

25:20.936 --> 25:22.854
not being
the girls' dad,

25:22.896 --> 25:25.273
but I cannot
take another lie.

25:25.315 --> 25:27.067
I mean, does anything
come out of your mouth

25:27.108 --> 25:28.860
that is actually
the truth?

25:30.779 --> 25:33.448
Everything
that I have done is

25:33.490 --> 25:35.742
so that we can be together.

25:35.784 --> 25:37.536
Henry, I love you.

25:37.577 --> 25:39.246
That's the truth.

25:39.287 --> 25:42.415
Well...

25:42.457 --> 25:44.042
I don't love you
anymore.

25:48.296 --> 25:50.090
Now I'm gonna go out.

25:50.131 --> 25:52.676
And when I get back,
I want you gone.

25:55.178 --> 25:58.098
Henry, I don't have
anywhere to go.

25:59.933 --> 26:03.103
I don't have any money.

26:03.144 --> 26:06.398
Well, I'm sure you'll
figure something out.

26:06.439 --> 26:08.149
You always do.

26:23.290 --> 26:25.500
The last of the guests
are gone.

26:25.542 --> 26:27.544
Thanks.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.296
Where's Juliet?

26:29.337 --> 26:30.922
I sent her to my place.

26:30.964 --> 26:32.924
Give her a chance
to clear her head.

26:32.966 --> 26:34.926
I can't believe
this is happening.

26:34.968 --> 26:38.346
I had every intention
of telling him...

26:38.388 --> 26:40.140
just not like this.

26:40.181 --> 26:42.017
Yeah, but you know,
maybe it's for the best.

26:42.058 --> 26:44.269
Now that everything's
out in the open,

26:44.311 --> 26:47.188
maybe you really can
start fresh.

26:47.230 --> 26:49.941
What's wrong?

26:49.983 --> 26:52.944
Um, you know, I think I
just feel like being alone

26:52.986 --> 26:54.529
if that's OK.

26:54.571 --> 26:56.031
Yeah, of course.

26:56.072 --> 26:57.490
Just know I'm here
for you.

26:57.532 --> 26:58.992
I do.

26:59.034 --> 27:00.577
Call if you need
anything, OK?

27:06.499 --> 27:08.793
[line connecting]

27:12.797 --> 27:14.049
Mrs. Martin.

27:14.090 --> 27:16.801
Bodaway Macawi's
in New York.

27:16.843 --> 27:18.011
What?

27:18.053 --> 27:19.763
Jimmy Kemper found me.

27:19.804 --> 27:21.264
Threatened to tell
Bodaway that I
was Bridget.

27:21.306 --> 27:22.724
Now Kemper's dead,

27:22.766 --> 27:24.768
which can only mean
one thing.

27:24.809 --> 27:26.686
Please, Agent Machado,
you're the only person
that can help me.

27:26.728 --> 27:28.063
Mrs. Martin, look,
I'm sorry,

27:28.104 --> 27:29.939
but my involvement in
the Macawi case is over.

27:29.981 --> 27:31.191
Why?

27:31.232 --> 27:32.901
Because my job
depends on it.

27:32.942 --> 27:34.736
And considering I've already
lost everything else,

27:34.778 --> 27:36.946
I just can't afford
to lose that, too.

27:36.988 --> 27:38.907
But look, you have every
right to be concerned.

27:38.948 --> 27:41.576
The second we hang up,
I'm gonna call
the New York office.

27:41.618 --> 27:42.994
I gotta go.

27:43.036 --> 27:44.996
No, Mrs. Martin, wait!

27:47.415 --> 27:49.209
[sighs]

27:49.250 --> 27:51.294
I know you probably
don't want to talk
to me right now,

27:51.336 --> 27:55.006
but you deserve
to know the truth.

27:58.593 --> 28:03.181
I love you more
than I ever thought

28:03.223 --> 28:07.018
it was possible
to love someone.

28:07.060 --> 28:10.814
My life... completely
changed

28:10.855 --> 28:12.816
when I met you
seven months ago.

28:12.857 --> 28:15.902
Seven years. Heh.

28:15.944 --> 28:19.572
No.

28:19.614 --> 28:21.491
Seven months.

28:24.577 --> 28:26.705
I didn't cheat on you
with Henry.

28:29.874 --> 28:31.501
Andrew, I...

28:35.880 --> 28:37.465
I'm not Siobhan.

28:39.509 --> 28:41.052
I'm Bridget.

28:50.270 --> 28:51.896
Obviously, there were
things about my wife

28:51.938 --> 28:54.065
that I didn't know,
but suicide?!

28:54.107 --> 28:55.692
There's just no way!

28:55.734 --> 28:57.777
It happened.

28:57.819 --> 29:00.905
I was there.
I'm sorry that this is...

29:00.947 --> 29:03.783
Don't you
dare apologize!

29:03.825 --> 29:06.119
There are no words
to make up for what
you've done!

29:09.330 --> 29:12.459
You looked me
in the eye and cried

29:12.500 --> 29:15.503
about your drug addict/
prostitute sister.

29:18.381 --> 29:20.467
And little did
I know that I was
sleeping next to her

29:20.508 --> 29:23.052
for the past
seven months.

29:23.094 --> 29:25.555
I never intended for it
to go on this long.

29:27.140 --> 29:30.268
I was only doing it
to protect myself.

29:30.310 --> 29:32.061
I never thought...

29:32.103 --> 29:33.980
I was gonna fall in love
with you.

29:37.567 --> 29:39.903
I so wanted Siobhan
to have changed.

29:41.738 --> 29:43.907
I guess you believe what
you want to believe, huh?

29:43.948 --> 29:45.116
[sighs]

29:47.577 --> 29:50.705
Like I needed to believe
that you might forgive me.

29:53.082 --> 29:56.753
That somehow you might...

29:56.795 --> 29:58.630
love me for me.

30:02.509 --> 30:04.552
[chuckles]

30:06.012 --> 30:07.555
I do love you...

30:12.143 --> 30:13.728
but it's all a lie.

30:13.770 --> 30:15.897
Don't say that.

30:15.939 --> 30:18.233
You know that's not true!

30:18.274 --> 30:20.735
Andrew,
I only did this

30:20.777 --> 30:24.280
because it was the only way
that I could protect myself.

30:24.322 --> 30:27.700
SHAYLENE: I told you,
take it easy.

30:27.742 --> 30:31.162
Will you lay off, warden?
It's a party.

30:31.204 --> 30:32.622
[glass breaks, body thuds,
woman sobs]

30:32.664 --> 30:33.915
Shay?

30:33.957 --> 30:35.750
[Shaylene gasping]

30:35.792 --> 30:38.461
BODAWAY: I know who
you're working for,
Shaylene.

30:38.503 --> 30:41.256
SHAYLENE:
I work for you!

30:41.297 --> 30:43.258
[gasping]

30:47.971 --> 30:49.138
[grunts]

30:54.978 --> 30:58.898
I ran as far as I could.

30:58.940 --> 31:02.402
It's a miracle that
Bodaway didn't get me.

31:02.443 --> 31:05.154
But the cops did.

31:05.196 --> 31:08.533
I have so many regrets
about what I've done.

31:12.704 --> 31:15.623
The basic tenet of NA
is truth, and...

31:17.458 --> 31:19.919
all I've been
doing is lying.

31:21.796 --> 31:23.423
But the one thing

31:23.464 --> 31:27.760
that I have
no regrets about...

31:27.802 --> 31:29.429
is loving you...

31:30.847 --> 31:32.348
and Juliet.

31:34.601 --> 31:37.645
I stayed sober because

31:37.687 --> 31:41.274
I had two people whose
expectations

31:41.316 --> 31:44.777
I wanted to live up to.

31:49.240 --> 31:50.825
I'm so sorry.

31:55.872 --> 31:58.124
And for what it's worth...

31:58.166 --> 32:01.878
[sighs]

32:01.920 --> 32:04.923
I'm a better person
for loving you.

32:21.397 --> 32:23.107
You need to leave.

32:36.245 --> 32:38.498
You know you can stay
as long as you like.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.460
London, honey,

32:42.502 --> 32:43.962
help me set up
the guest room

32:44.003 --> 32:45.922
so we can give Siobhan
and Juliet some privacy.

32:52.011 --> 32:54.013
How could you
do this, Siobhan?

32:54.055 --> 32:56.140
I mean, I thought
that you and Daddy

32:56.182 --> 32:58.351
were happy together.

32:58.393 --> 33:00.687
And I thought that the three
of us were finally starting

33:00.728 --> 33:02.397
to become a real family.

33:02.438 --> 33:05.108
We are a real family.

33:05.149 --> 33:07.193
And I didn't have
an affair.

33:07.235 --> 33:10.530
Then why would
Mr. Arbogast say that?

33:10.571 --> 33:12.657
Because...

33:14.367 --> 33:16.536
I'm not who
he thinks I am.

33:16.577 --> 33:18.913
[knock on door]

33:24.168 --> 33:26.170
Oh. Hey, Andrew.
What are you doing here?

33:29.882 --> 33:32.135
I've been wanting
to do that since
the day I met you.

33:39.308 --> 33:41.144
Say something.

33:43.479 --> 33:45.690
I knew you were
too good to be true...

33:48.943 --> 33:50.737
Bridget.

33:50.778 --> 33:54.240
-Juliet, I...
-Don't bother.

33:54.282 --> 33:57.535
You think my mom's
an awful person?

33:57.577 --> 34:00.288
You are exactly
like her.

34:01.956 --> 34:05.752
Actually, worse.

34:05.793 --> 34:07.378
She's sick.

34:08.796 --> 34:10.965
What's your excuse?

34:20.516 --> 34:22.060
[horn honking]

34:28.107 --> 34:30.359
Ready?

34:30.401 --> 34:32.361
I don't want to
go to the beach.

34:35.364 --> 34:37.200
And I can't stay
at home.

34:39.744 --> 34:42.288
Come on, sweetheart.

34:42.330 --> 34:44.624
Remember what I said?

34:44.665 --> 34:47.043
It's gonna be me and you
against the world.

34:48.586 --> 34:51.089
No matter what...

34:51.130 --> 34:52.924
we always have
each other.

34:57.595 --> 34:58.805
OK.

35:00.556 --> 35:01.724
[laughs]

35:49.897 --> 35:51.691
[thud, crash]

35:54.402 --> 35:56.320
Hello?

35:58.906 --> 36:00.199
Andrew?

36:04.495 --> 36:06.080
[sighs]

36:10.334 --> 36:13.045
[grunts, chokes]

36:14.505 --> 36:16.090
Hello, Bridget.

36:16.132 --> 36:18.092
You have
the wrong girl.

36:20.887 --> 36:22.680
No! I'm not Bridget!

36:22.722 --> 36:24.599
[grunts]

36:31.314 --> 36:32.565
[groans]

36:40.156 --> 36:42.658
BRIDGET: I can't leave
things with Juliet like this.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.327
I mean, I don't even know if
Andrew's gonna let me see her,

36:44.368 --> 36:47.413
I just need the chance
to be able to tell...

36:47.455 --> 36:49.749
Oh, my God.

36:49.790 --> 36:51.417
Oh...

36:51.459 --> 36:52.627
SOLOMON: Bridget?

36:52.668 --> 36:53.961
Solomon, call 911.

36:54.003 --> 36:55.338
Bridget,
what's happening?

36:55.379 --> 36:56.714
Bodaway's here.

36:56.756 --> 36:58.257
Bridget?

36:58.299 --> 36:59.675
Bridget!

36:59.717 --> 37:01.552
Damn it!

37:23.574 --> 37:26.202
You can't hide forever, Bridget!

37:26.244 --> 37:27.828
This ends tonight.

38:07.368 --> 38:08.953
Stop!

38:11.664 --> 38:13.124
Juliet!

38:16.752 --> 38:18.462
What the hell?

38:18.504 --> 38:20.131
Drop the knife!

38:21.799 --> 38:23.759
Easy.

38:23.801 --> 38:26.053
I said, drop it now.

38:39.483 --> 38:41.610
Andrew?

38:55.291 --> 38:57.168
MACHADO: FBI! Freeze!

38:57.209 --> 38:58.377
[Bridget gasping]

39:00.963 --> 39:03.966
[police radio transmissions]

39:04.008 --> 39:06.761
Mrs. Martin, it's OK.
It's OK. It's OK.

39:06.802 --> 39:08.637
It's OK, Mrs. Martin.

39:08.679 --> 39:09.847
It's OK.

39:09.889 --> 39:11.974
Oh...what are
you doing here?

39:12.016 --> 39:13.934
The second you hung
up, I got on a plane.

39:13.976 --> 39:15.686
But where's Juliet?
I heard her yelling.

39:15.728 --> 39:17.480
No, no. I spoke
with your husband.

39:17.521 --> 39:19.190
He and Juliet have
been in the Hamptons
since midnight.

39:19.231 --> 39:21.275
OFFICER: It's clear.

39:21.317 --> 39:23.235
Then who was
Bodaway attacking?

39:28.532 --> 39:29.909
Ma'am, visiting hours
are over.

39:29.950 --> 39:31.911
I'm sorry.

39:31.952 --> 39:34.663
I know.

39:34.705 --> 39:36.540
I don't have
anywhere to go.

39:38.167 --> 39:40.711
We don't
have anywhere to go.

39:42.338 --> 39:44.632
I might be able to
find you a cot.

39:54.892 --> 39:58.145
I have to get
my old life back.

39:58.187 --> 39:59.688
OFFICER:
We're releasing the scene now.

40:03.275 --> 40:04.985
Aren't you glad
you took that gun?

40:07.196 --> 40:09.031
I got something
to show you.

40:09.073 --> 40:10.741
Ugh, now what?

40:10.783 --> 40:12.743
Surveillance footage.

40:12.785 --> 40:14.954
Turns out Delario rented
a boat at the same marina

40:14.995 --> 40:16.414
that your sister
docked her boat at.

40:16.455 --> 40:19.166
September 9.

40:19.208 --> 40:21.961

already, don't you?

41:03.002 --> 41:04.670
Yeah.

41:04.712 --> 41:06.088
Where is she?

41:06.130 --> 41:07.590
I don't--I don't know.

41:07.631 --> 41:09.133
I kicked her out earlier.

41:09.175 --> 41:11.010
It's over between
me and Siobhan.

41:11.051 --> 41:12.636
She was here.

41:12.678 --> 41:14.138
In New York.

41:17.433 --> 41:19.518
That's who Bodaway
attacked in the apartment.

41:19.560 --> 41:21.770
What are you talking about?

41:21.812 --> 41:23.397
Why did she lie to me?

41:23.439 --> 41:24.899
Why did she want me
to think

41:24.940 --> 41:26.484
that she
killed herself?

41:30.654 --> 41:32.239
Because she knew

41:32.281 --> 41:34.742
that someone was
trying to kill her.

41:34.783 --> 41:39.205
And she wanted you
to take her place

41:39.246 --> 41:40.998
