WANT HER BACK.

TO YOUR SISTER,

OUR OWN DEMONS, OK?

11:00.790 --> 11:04.011

14:49.323 --> 14:50.802
YOU CAN'T STOP THEM
FROM COMING.

14:50.977 --> 14:53.501

WHEN ARE THEY COMING?

14:55.329 --> 14:56.286
NOW.

14:58.941 --> 15:03.337
SO, HOW LONG
DOES IT USUALLY TAKE
FOR DEMONS TO ATTACK?

15:03.511 --> 15:05.513
WELL, IT COULD BE
ANYTIME REALLY.

15:07.689 --> 15:09.169
ON TIMING,

THE WORSE IT IS FOR US,

THE BETTER IT IS
FOR THEM, YOU KNOW?

THAT KIND OF THING.

15:14.174 --> 15:15.305
UH, NO, THANKS.

YOU CAN STILL OPT OUT

NOT A CHANCE.

15:19.483 --> 15:20.528

I'M ALL RIGHT. I'M OK.

15:54.692 --> 15:56.564
OH.

15:56.738 --> 15:57.869
ARE YOU OK?

16:05.094 --> 16:06.922
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT HAPPENED?

16:07.096 --> 16:09.969
ASK THE FIRE STARTER.

16:18.499 --> 16:19.326

16:20.805 --> 16:22.285
YOU KNOW YOU COULD
HAVE BEEN KILLED?

16:22.459 --> 16:23.330
PAIGE, I'M OK.

16:23.504 --> 16:24.418
NO, YOU'RE NOT OK.

16:24.592 --> 16:26.028
YOU WERE HIT
BY A FIREBALL,

16:26.202 --> 16:27.856
WHICH WAS
ACTUALLY MY FAULT.

16:28.030 --> 16:29.162
NO, IT WAS
NOT YOUR FAULT.

16:29.336 --> 16:30.946
I'M A GROWN MAN.
I CHOSE TO BE HERE.

16:33.775 --> 16:35.951
HENRY, I REALLY THINK
YOU SHOULD LEAVE.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.561
WE DON'T KNOW
IF THEY'RE COMING BACK.

16:37.735 --> 16:39.520
PAIGE, I'M NOT LEAVING.

16:39.694 --> 16:40.608
I'M NOT HAVING THIS
ON MY HEAD, OK?

16:40.782 --> 16:43.263
SO PLEASE, PLEASE...

16:43.437 --> 16:44.438
ALL RIGHT.

16:51.140 --> 16:53.055
I KNOW THAT WAS
PROBABLY HARD FOR YOU.

16:53.229 --> 16:54.143
WELL, I GUESS IT WOULD
HAVE BEEN HARDER

16:54.317 --> 16:56.189
IF I WAS PLANNING
HIS FUNERAL.

16:56.363 --> 17:01.977
WELL, LOOKS LIKE CHRISTY
HAS A FEW MORE POWERS
THAN WE REALIZED, HUH?

17:02.151 --> 17:03.718
YEAH, MAYBE MORE
THAN EVEN SHE KNEW ABOUT.

17:03.892 --> 17:05.241
MAYBE THAT'S
WHY THOSE DEMONS

17:05.415 --> 17:07.026
WERE HOLDING HER HOSTAGE
FOR ALL THOSE YEARS.

17:07.200 --> 17:11.073
MAYBE THEY WERE TRYING
TO CO-OPT HER POWERS
FOR THEMSELVES.

17:11.247 --> 17:12.640
BUT I DON'T THINK
SHE'S THAT POWERFUL.

17:12.814 --> 17:15.382
I MEAN, UNLESS
THEY KNOW SOMETHING
THAT WE DON'T.

17:15.556 --> 17:17.862
WELL, ALL THE MORE REASON
FOR HER TO OPEN UP,

17:18.037 --> 17:19.081
SO WE CAN FIND OUT.

17:19.255 --> 17:20.561
I JUST THINK
SHE'S TOO FREAKED OUT.

17:20.735 --> 17:22.824
WELL, SHE NEEDS TO GET
UNFREAKED OUT, AND FAST.

17:24.565 --> 17:27.698
OK, I'M GONNA
GO DROP OFF WYATT
WITH DAD AND CHRIS

17:27.872 --> 17:28.873
AND GET ONE
OF THE OTHER MOMS

17:29.048 --> 17:30.310
TO TAKE OVER
COOKIE DUTIES.

17:30.484 --> 17:31.659
WAIT. WHY?

17:31.833 --> 17:33.356
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WHY?
WHY DO YOU THINK?

17:33.530 --> 17:35.445
WE CAN
HANDLE THIS, PIPER.

17:35.619 --> 17:36.838
YEAH, BUT...
NO BUTS.

17:37.012 --> 17:39.362
LISTEN, YOU BAKE
AND SPEND TIME WITH WYATT,

17:39.536 --> 17:41.364
AND, HOPEFULLY,
WE CAN FIGURE OUT

17:41.538 --> 17:43.018
WHO WE'RE UP AGAINST
BEFORE THEY COME BACK.

17:43.192 --> 17:44.628
OR BEFORE CHRISTY
BURNS DOWN THE HOUSE.

17:50.852 --> 17:51.940
CHRISTY?

17:52.114 --> 17:53.028
I'M SORRY.

17:54.508 --> 17:55.813
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO DO THAT.

17:55.987 --> 17:58.294
NO, IT'S OK.
YOU DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.

17:58.468 --> 18:00.470
DID YOU KNOW
YOU COULD DO--

18:00.644 --> 18:01.689
NO.

18:04.170 --> 18:05.519
BUT THEY DID.

18:05.693 --> 18:08.304
THEY? YOU MEAN
THE DEMONS?

18:08.478 --> 18:10.915
WERE THOSE
THE SAME ONES?

18:13.092 --> 18:15.050
WHO ARE THEY?

18:15.224 --> 18:16.660
I DON'T KNOW.

18:16.834 --> 18:19.228
I NEVER KNEW.

18:19.402 --> 18:20.316
HEY, IT'S OK.

18:20.490 --> 18:22.362
I TOLD YOU
WE'D PROTECT YOU,

18:22.536 --> 18:23.928
AND WE DID.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.843
LOOK, I'M NOT GONNA
LET THEM HURT YOU
ANYMORE,

18:26.017 --> 18:28.019
I PROMISE.

18:30.196 --> 18:32.589
IT'S OVER.
DON'T YOU SEE THAT?

18:32.763 --> 18:36.506
THE CHARMED ONES
ARE PROTECTING HER NOW.

18:36.680 --> 18:37.725
WE STILL HAVE TIME.

18:37.899 --> 18:39.857
THEY HAVEN'T SENSED
ANYTHING YET.

18:40.031 --> 18:41.207
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

18:41.381 --> 18:42.643
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THEY ARE NOT DECIDING

18:42.817 --> 18:44.253
OUR PUNISHMENT
AS WE SPEAK?

18:44.427 --> 18:46.734
BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE
ACTED BY NOW IF THEY HAD.

18:46.908 --> 18:49.084
THEY'RE NOT KNOWN
FOR THEIR PATIENCE.

18:50.738 --> 18:52.261
WE HAVE TO GET
THE WITCH BACK SOMEHOW.

18:52.435 --> 18:53.349
IMPOSSIBLE.

18:53.523 --> 18:54.872
WE DO NOT HAVE THE POWER

18:55.046 --> 18:57.266
TO GO UP AGAINST
THE CHARMED ONES
AND SURVIVE.

18:57.440 --> 19:02.053
STILL, IT WOULD BE
BETTER TO BE VANQUISHED
BY THE WITCHES

19:02.228 --> 19:04.926
THAN BY THE TRIAD.

19:06.406 --> 19:09.539
THAT WOULD BE A FATE
WORSE THAN DEATH.

19:10.758 --> 19:13.413
THEN, PERHAPS
WE SHOULD ESCAPE,

19:13.587 --> 19:15.328
HIDE FROM THEM.

19:15.502 --> 19:19.593
THEY'RE THE MOST

TO BE KEEPING PAIGE
AWAY FROM THE MAGICAL WORLD

AWAY FROM ANYTHING.

28:05.945 --> 28:07.120
ARE DOING FINE
WITHOUT YOU.

AND I CAN
GIVE IT TO HER.
