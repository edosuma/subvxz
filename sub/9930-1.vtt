41:24.315 --> 41:28.843
If he had been lost then how
can we able to look after him?

41:28.853 --> 41:32.763
And who wrote this? Who
wrote this absent note?

41:32.923 --> 41:35.950
You aren't able to write
properly, bloody, duffer, idiot.

41:35.960 --> 41:38.385
You could pass if you are
able to write that much.

41:38.395 --> 41:40.221
Who wrote this note, Ishaan?

41:40.231 --> 41:42.231
Speak, who wrote this?

41:42.867 --> 41:48.987
Ishaan, this is the last time I'm
asking you. Who wrote this absent note?

41:49.473 --> 41:51.131
- Speak. Who wrote?
- No.

41:51.141 --> 41:52.132
- Tell.
- No.

41:52.142 --> 41:54.142
Tell me.

42:00.618 --> 42:04.378
Class work and homework, haven't
any improvement in both of it.

42:04.388 --> 42:06.428
Just like the last year.

42:06.590 --> 42:11.690
Book is still his enemies. Like
read and write is punishment.

42:12.363 --> 42:16.790
His English handwriting
seems to be Russian sometimes.

42:16.800 --> 42:21.829
He deliberately repeats mistakes. His
attention is always at outside of the class.

42:21.839 --> 42:24.532
All the time asking for
permission to go to the toilet.

42:24.542 --> 42:26.433
I'm thirsty. I want to do pee.

42:26.443 --> 42:28.908
Thirsty, pee... thirsty, pee.

42:29.246 --> 42:32.239
Disturbs the whole class
with his silly pranks

42:32.249 --> 42:38.012
And have you been through with his exam
papers. He boiled the eggs in every subject.

42:38.022 --> 42:40.147
Did you send his exam papers?

42:40.157 --> 42:45.937
On last Wednesday for parents
signature. Haven't returned till today.

42:50.868 --> 42:52.868
Look this.

42:53.270 --> 43:01.439
Math's test. 3x9=3, enough. After
that he left all the questions.

43:03.781 --> 43:09.136
Who would accept that he's the
younger brother of Yohan Awasthi?

43:13.857 --> 43:15.857
- Mr. Awasthi.
- Yes.

43:17.561 --> 43:22.189
By the way this is the second
year of your son in third standard.

43:22.199 --> 43:28.744
If it's running such like that then I'm
sorry I wouldn't able to help you out.

43:29.540 --> 43:32.175
Maybe he's having some problem.

43:32.643 --> 43:34.643
What do you mean?

43:34.678 --> 43:39.615
Maybe he... Some children are unlucky.

43:40.684 --> 43:46.124
And there are special kind of
schools for these kind of children.

43:51.562 --> 43:53.587
- Water, sir.
- Get a side.

43:53.597 --> 43:55.422
I told you, move form there.

43:55.432 --> 43:59.682
- 10 rupees sir... 10 rupee.
- Son of 10, 10 rupee.

44:07.745 --> 44:12.590
Thinks my son is a retard.
She thinks my son isn't normal.

44:14.284 --> 44:16.577
Err! They filled up the
class with 60 children.

44:16.587 --> 44:19.113
Teacher wouldn't able to
pay attention on every child.

44:19.123 --> 44:21.250
Bloody nonsense. Idiots.

44:24.862 --> 44:30.524
What I hadn't done? I did the job
for the kids and left every thing.

44:30.534 --> 44:35.162
I took the lessons by myself in morning
and evening, Ishaan... Ishaan... Ishaan.

44:35.172 --> 44:37.552
No Maya it's not your fault.

44:38.976 --> 44:41.951
He wouldn't improve such like that.

44:43.747 --> 44:46.373
Okay... okay, tomorrow I
come early in the morning.

44:46.383 --> 44:52.163
Thanks a lot Suresh. Thank you very
much. Good night... good night...

44:52.356 --> 44:54.356
Done.

44:56.527 --> 44:59.077
But in the middle of the term.

44:59.196 --> 45:01.622
Suresh kapdia's uncle is the
founder trusty of the school.

45:01.632 --> 45:04.224
I'll submit the fee tomorrow
by meeting with the headmaster.

45:04.234 --> 45:06.326
No, I'll not go. I'm not go to go.

45:06.336 --> 45:09.736
Ishaan, shut up. Have your food quietly.

45:09.940 --> 45:11.940
Will not to go.

45:13.043 --> 45:19.139
Let him finish this year, I mean...
he never stayed without me till today.

45:19.149 --> 45:21.359
He'll have to get used to.

45:21.652 --> 45:24.244
And wasn't you heard the
principal? They wouldn't allow him

45:24.254 --> 45:27.314
...in the school next year. They'll
fail him again and expel him.

45:27.324 --> 45:29.324
Then where will we go?

45:34.798 --> 45:37.348
Look... look how he's staring?

45:38.102 --> 45:40.564
No bloody regret on his face.

45:40.574 --> 45:45.671
There at boarding school, they'll
straighten him up by force.

45:45.809 --> 45:51.844
Today he asked Yohan to write a note,
don't know what he'll do tomorrow?

45:53.650 --> 45:56.200
Trust me Maya, I'm his father.

45:56.587 --> 46:00.752
Fee is out of our budget
but we'll manage any how.

46:02.459 --> 46:05.859
His term will starts
after the Deepawali.

46:06.263 --> 46:08.983
Baba please Baba, don't send me.

46:09.166 --> 46:12.292
Baba please, I'll not go to boarding school.

46:12.302 --> 46:15.957

go to boarding school.

46:16.240 --> 46:20.100

48:02.446 --> 48:04.838

48:04.848 --> 48:07.040
You are fearing to go to
boarding school, aren't you?

48:07.050 --> 48:08.041
Yes, speak.

48:08.051 --> 48:09.943

You are afraid I know.

48:12.022 --> 48:15.507

- I know you are afraid.

48:19.897 --> 48:24.027
- Look, what I'm doing?

48:25.369 --> 48:27.664
I'll not go... I'll not go.

48:52.062 --> 48:55.462
Your Papa says that
you are too stubborn.

48:56.300 --> 49:03.331
Listen one thing very clearly. Only one
rule is running in this school. Discipline.

49:05.809 --> 49:08.189
Don't you worry Mr. Awasthi.

49:08.845 --> 49:12.075
We tamed so many wild
horses over here.

51:03.794 --> 51:06.686
Change your cloths
in dormitory for food.

51:06.696 --> 51:08.696
Come on.

52:04.654 --> 52:08.081
You are sitting without doing anything
till now. Haven't changed your cloths.

52:08.091 --> 52:09.483
Go and change your cloths.

52:09.493 --> 52:11.493
Come on.

52:39.156 --> 52:42.216
Lets go, it's 9 o'clock. Lights out.

54:54.457 --> 54:56.667
You aren't ready till now.

54:56.893 --> 55:03.098
And Isn't this the way to wear the
tie? Hasn't mother taught you anything?

55:08.171 --> 55:11.826

55:26.523 --> 55:29.243
Just beside the Rajan Damodhran.

55:29.426 --> 55:32.719
Rajan Damodhran always
stood first in the class.

55:32.729 --> 55:37.829
I wish that Rajan Dhamodhran
company pay good effects on you.

55:38.034 --> 55:40.414
Do you understand? Sit down.

55:42.539 --> 55:48.500

is today's topic. Page No. 28.

55:50.613 --> 55:57.143

central idea of the poem.'Nature'.

Start Rajan.

56:05.028 --> 56:06.720
'Nature'

56:06.730 --> 56:11.895
'Open sky from the top', 'Your
world is filled with clouds'

56:12.635 --> 56:17.990
'It's blinked like a jewel till
the elephant dies due to thrust'

56:18.475 --> 56:23.811
'Bicycle buzzer, stone
or mud or blind man stick'

56:24.614 --> 56:30.139
'Then you seems to be filled with
water, you are our sweet stream'

56:30.186 --> 56:36.901
Very good. Yes Ishaan Anand kishor Awasthi
explain the central idea of the poem.

56:44.801 --> 56:53.732
What we see, we feel it exists and what
we can't see we feel it isn't exists.

56:54.911 --> 56:58.779
But sometimes what we see, isn't true.

56:59.849 --> 57:05.116
And what isn't visible, is true. Means.

57:05.922 --> 57:09.832
Err! What are you doing
visible or not visible?

57:10.593 --> 57:12.585
Menoo Patel you explain.

57:12.595 --> 57:19.759
Poet says when he see the stream then he's
see the sky reflection in it and he explain

57:19.769 --> 57:24.097
that reflection with different kind of ways.
And the flow of the stream rises again.

57:24.107 --> 57:26.107
Good, very good.

57:26.176 --> 57:28.176
Menoo Patel, sit down.

57:28.478 --> 57:32.938
Yes children, 'Open sky from the top'...

57:35.251 --> 57:38.912
Actually you explained the
real meanings of the poem.

57:38.922 --> 57:42.067
Rest of them gave the copied answers.

57:43.359 --> 57:45.569
Sir Tevari is very strict.

57:45.862 --> 57:49.195

58:02.745 --> 58:05.125

why your parents send you here?

58:21.397 --> 58:23.397

My father is the state manager

58:31.574 --> 58:36.069
...of the school. I live in the
staff quarters with my parents.

58:36.079 --> 58:42.029
And who said to you that all the
children come here for the punishment?

58:51.227 --> 58:52.652
Children.

58:52.662 --> 58:56.657
Open your sketch books
and takeout your pencils.

58:57.233 --> 58:58.424
Good.

58:58.434 --> 59:01.834
Copy without using
any scale and utensil.

59:02.539 --> 59:04.539
Lines must be straight.

59:04.774 --> 59:09.194

59:40.143 --> 59:42.143
Do you see?

59:42.478 --> 59:44.478
Isn't visible.

59:44.614 --> 59:47.589

59:50.086 --> 59:55.101
