- They're all against gays.

00:20.187 --> 00:22.689
<i>They'll do anything to</i>
<i>to destroy them,</i>

00:22.689 --> 00:23.690
<i>to kill them,</i>

00:23.690 --> 00:25.459
<i>to torture them.</i>

00:36.670 --> 00:41.308
<i>- The Middle East has a huge</i>
<i>humanitarian crisis.</i>

00:41.308 --> 00:45.012
If no countries
are accepting refugees,

00:45.012 --> 00:48.215
<i>a lot more people will end up</i>
<i>killed in their home countries</i>

00:48.215 --> 00:49.583
when they're trying to flee.

00:53.420 --> 00:57.424
<i>- Ramadi was the most</i>
<i>dangerous area in the world.</i>

00:57.424 --> 00:59.660
I never thought I'm
gonna find love

00:59.660 --> 01:01.461
in this place.

01:56.450 --> 01:59.853
<i>Since I was born,</i>
<i>I always know I'm gay.</i>

01:59.853 --> 02:02.456
<i>I'm different.</i>

02:02.456 --> 02:05.425
<i>My family is more open</i>

02:05.425 --> 02:07.828
<i>from other Iraqi families,</i>

02:07.828 --> 02:11.231
<i>but not, of course,</i>
<i>about gays or straights.</i>

02:11.231 --> 02:14.368
[children singing]

02:21.074 --> 02:22.543
<i>In Saddam time,</i>

02:22.543 --> 02:25.379
<i>if two gays have sex together,</i>

02:25.379 --> 02:30.083
<i>they put them in jail</i>
<i>for 15 years.</i>

02:30.083 --> 02:34.121
Or the tribe
and the families,

02:34.121 --> 02:37.858
they don't want people
talking bad about them,

02:37.858 --> 02:43.497
<i>so they make them run away</i>
<i>to get the shame out.</i>

02:43.497 --> 02:46.733
<i>I don't want to shame my</i>
<i>family.</i>

02:46.733 --> 02:49.102
<i>So when I was in high school,</i>

02:49.102 --> 02:53.740
I start to go to the mosque.

02:53.740 --> 02:54.975
<i>I start to pray,</i>

02:54.975 --> 02:57.878
<i>and I start to change</i>
<i>how I talk.</i>

02:57.878 --> 02:59.179
<i>I want to be so manly.</i>

02:59.179 --> 03:01.882
<i>I want to be</i>
<i>like other people</i>

03:01.882 --> 03:03.283
<i>or better than them.</i>

03:03.283 --> 03:07.621
<i>I change a lot of myself.</i>

03:07.621 --> 03:11.892
<i>My father, he asked me</i>
<i>to buy cigarettes for him.</i>

03:11.892 --> 03:15.062
<i>And I told him,</i>
<i>with Arabic dialect,</i>

03:15.062 --> 03:17.431
<i>I'm not gonna buy</i>
<i>the cigarettes for you,</i>

03:17.431 --> 03:18.932
<i>because it's a poison,</i>

03:18.932 --> 03:22.369
and it's gonna poison
you and gonna kill you.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.972
And he was like,
"Are you crazy?"

03:24.972 --> 03:27.474
because the way--how I talked
with him.

03:27.474 --> 03:30.143
And I was wearing--I was
wearing, like,

03:30.143 --> 03:31.645
a--like, a shemagh.

03:31.645 --> 03:34.414
<i>And he say</i>
<i>to my youngest brother,</i>

03:34.414 --> 03:36.683
<i>"I don't know what's</i>
<i>going on with your brother."</i>

03:36.683 --> 03:39.319
The way how I walk in
and sit like it,

03:39.319 --> 03:41.188
like--it was, like, funny,

03:41.188 --> 03:42.789
if I remember it now.

03:42.789 --> 03:45.559
But in that time,
I was very serious.

03:45.559 --> 03:49.596
I was like, "Yes,
that's the new Nayyef now."

03:49.596 --> 03:51.999
<i>And that last maybe two weeks.</i>

03:51.999 --> 03:54.368
<i>This is not me.</i>

03:54.368 --> 03:58.105
<i>So I need to explore,</i>

03:58.105 --> 04:00.340
<i>try to find gay life.</i>

04:10.617 --> 04:15.322
In 1997, I get accepted
by Baghdad University,

04:15.322 --> 04:16.656
in fine art college.

04:16.656 --> 04:18.125
<i>There was a lot of students.</i>

04:18.125 --> 04:21.060
<i>They come from Jordan,</i>
<i>from Libya, from Yemen,</i>

04:21.060 --> 04:22.663
<i>from Lebanon.</i>

04:22.663 --> 04:25.899
<i>So in that time, I meet a lot</i>
<i>of other gay guys,</i>

04:25.899 --> 04:28.635
<i>and I felt like,</i>

04:28.635 --> 04:31.405
"Oh, my God, this is
the heaven for me."

04:38.078 --> 04:40.581
<i>I start wearing</i>
<i>different clothes,</i>

04:40.581 --> 04:42.683
<i>like skinny jeans.</i>

04:42.683 --> 04:45.085
<i>I start doing stuff</i>
<i>with my hair, you know,</i>

04:45.085 --> 04:49.456
<i>start wearing my contacts.</i>

04:49.456 --> 04:53.794
<i>And I was having</i>
<i>my first relationship</i>

04:53.794 --> 04:55.596
<i>with other guy.</i>

05:03.370 --> 05:07.674
So the gays back in Baghdad,
we still have same problem.

05:07.674 --> 05:09.309
<i>Even if it's a more open area,</i>

05:09.309 --> 05:12.446
<i>two guys together,</i>
<i>they're gonna put you in jail.</i>

05:12.446 --> 05:15.549
The funny is,
if there's two guys

05:15.549 --> 05:17.084
holding hand each other,

05:17.084 --> 05:19.887
that's normal
between two straight guys.

05:19.887 --> 05:21.088
They just friends.

05:21.088 --> 05:22.789
<i>When the Americans come to</i>
<i>Iraq,</i>

05:22.789 --> 05:25.359
<i>they think all the guys are</i>
<i>gay.</i>

05:25.359 --> 05:27.494
<i>I never hold friends' hands,</i>

05:27.494 --> 05:29.530
because I'm really gay.

05:40.507 --> 05:43.644
[explosions booming]

05:45.345 --> 05:48.482
[sirens wailing]

05:52.452 --> 05:55.789
<i>- My fellow citizens,</i>
<i>at this hour,</i>

05:55.789 --> 05:57.691
<i>American and coalition forces</i>

05:57.691 --> 06:02.829
<i>are in the early stages</i>
<i>of military operations</i>

06:02.829 --> 06:06.033
<i>to disarm Iraq,</i>
<i>to free its people,</i>

06:06.033 --> 06:08.669
and to defend the world
from grave danger.

06:15.542 --> 06:18.679
- 2003, after I graduate,
the war start.

06:18.679 --> 06:22.516
<i>American troops</i>
<i>come inside Baghdad.</i>

06:22.516 --> 06:25.953
<i>We never thought</i>
<i>Saddam will be gone.</i>

06:25.953 --> 06:31.725
<i>All my life, I know</i>
<i>how powerful he is.</i>

06:31.725 --> 06:33.861
<i>It's like the walls have ears.</i>

06:33.861 --> 06:36.663
<i>They can hear you,</i>
<i>even if you talk with yourself.</i>

06:36.663 --> 06:41.435
<i>So we don't believe</i>
<i>it's happening.</i>

06:41.435 --> 06:45.072
<i>I moved back to the South,</i>
<i>and I was looking for a job.</i>

06:45.072 --> 06:48.542
Two friends start working
as translators with Americans,

06:48.542 --> 06:52.212
with the Dutch,
with the British.

06:52.212 --> 06:55.816
They give them $5 every week.

06:55.816 --> 06:59.486
$5--it's enough for me
the whole week.

06:59.486 --> 07:01.021
<i>I was looking to them,</i>

07:01.021 --> 07:04.258
and I just wish talk
with someone English,

07:04.258 --> 07:05.893
so I can test my English.

07:05.893 --> 07:09.530
And I start talk
with some foot patrol,

07:09.530 --> 07:11.265
<i>and I told them</i>
<i>about my background.</i>

07:11.265 --> 07:12.799
<i>I was in the college.</i>

07:12.799 --> 07:15.135
And he say, "Okay,
just come tomorrow,"

07:15.135 --> 07:18.372
and I start.

07:18.372 --> 07:20.040
<i>They give me a chance.</i>

07:20.040 --> 07:22.142
They're not kick me out--"Oh,
you know what?

07:22.142 --> 07:24.578
You're not speaking English
very well, so just go."

07:24.578 --> 07:26.780
They start teaching me,

07:26.780 --> 07:30.584
<i>and I start learning</i>
<i>military things.</i>

07:34.555 --> 07:37.191
<i>A friend of mine went to</i>
<i>Ramadi.</i>

07:37.191 --> 07:39.159
He said, "They pay you,

07:39.159 --> 07:42.362
in a month, $1,200."

07:42.362 --> 07:44.064
<i>This was a big step for me,</i>

07:44.064 --> 07:48.068
<i>and I decide</i>
<i>to go there in 2004.</i>

07:51.972 --> 07:55.075
<i>They take us by big convoy</i>
<i>to Ramadi,</i>

07:55.075 --> 08:00.814
<i>protect with guns</i>
<i>and armor cars.</i>

08:00.814 --> 08:02.583
<i>We'd move in the night,</i>

08:02.583 --> 08:07.354
<i>so the terrorists,</i>
<i>they could not see us.</i>

08:07.354 --> 08:09.756
<i>The trip was six hours</i>

08:09.756 --> 08:12.926
<i>between Baghdad and Ramadi.</i>

08:12.926 --> 08:14.494
<i>We didn't know</i>
<i>what's in the way.</i>

08:14.494 --> 08:16.296
<i>You heard about the IED bombs</i>

08:16.296 --> 08:17.531
<i>all the time,</i>

08:17.531 --> 08:19.800
<i>so I was very, very scared.</i>

08:23.904 --> 08:26.907
<i>And next morning, the commander</i>
<i>for the translators</i>

08:26.907 --> 08:29.910
<i>says, "We're here</i>
<i>helping the soldiers</i>

08:29.910 --> 08:33.113
to clear the city
from the terrorists."

08:33.113 --> 08:35.916
- Throw the grenade
in the bunker.

08:35.916 --> 08:41.388
<i>- They start training</i>
<i>me--shooting, run, fight.</i>

08:41.388 --> 08:44.424
<i>They give me American uniform,</i>
<i>they give me a weapon,</i>

08:44.424 --> 08:49.296
<i>and I looked like one</i>
<i>of the American troops.</i>

08:49.296 --> 08:50.697
<i>I have a nickname.</i>

08:50.697 --> 08:52.165
<i>I not give my real name.</i>

08:52.165 --> 08:53.901
<i>My name was David.</i>

08:53.901 --> 08:56.837
Americans teach us this
for our protection.

08:56.837 --> 08:59.540
<i>Because we're teaching</i>
<i>the Iraqi new army,</i>

08:59.540 --> 09:04.478
<i>we don't know if Iraqi soldiers</i>
<i>work with the terrorists.</i>

09:04.478 --> 09:05.846
And we find, actually,

09:05.846 --> 09:07.881
some of them was a spy
for the terrorists.

09:07.881 --> 09:11.385
- The most dangerous part
of Iraq remains the region west

09:11.385 --> 09:16.924
of Baghdad, especially
the city of Ramadi.

09:16.924 --> 09:18.859
<i>- Half the total number</i>
<i>of U.S. servicemen</i>

09:18.859 --> 09:20.928
<i>killed in Iraq during March</i>

09:20.928 --> 09:23.230
<i>gave their lives in Ramadi,</i>

09:23.230 --> 09:27.734
<i>now the last great stronghold</i>
<i>of the Iraqi insurgency.</i>

09:27.734 --> 09:30.304
- Grueling fighting
continued today in Ramadi.

09:30.304 --> 09:32.606
<i>The U.S. military</i>
<i>says it appears</i>

09:32.606 --> 09:34.274
<i>some of these enemy fighters</i>

09:34.274 --> 09:38.679
<i>are foreigners who possibly</i>
<i>entered Iraq from Syria.</i>

09:38.679 --> 09:40.047
<i>- In the first week I'm there,</i>

09:40.047 --> 09:41.548
<i>there is a tower--a</i>
<i>watching tower</i>

09:41.548 --> 09:44.451
<i>and a cam--and two soldier</i>
<i>Iraqis was there.</i>

09:44.451 --> 09:45.786
They get shot by a sniper.

09:45.786 --> 09:48.355
And I heard all the soldiers.

09:48.355 --> 09:50.924
They start screaming.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.659
- Fire over there!
It's locked in!

09:52.659 --> 09:55.395
- Target!

09:55.395 --> 09:57.764
<i>- They find out</i>
<i>where the shot come from.</i>

09:57.764 --> 10:00.767
<i>It's a normal family building.</i>

10:00.767 --> 10:03.070
The sniper make a hole
in the window,

10:03.070 --> 10:05.405
and he was shooting us
from the family.

10:05.405 --> 10:08.408
- Watch that building!

10:08.408 --> 10:12.112
<i>- That's when I realized</i>
<i>how dangerous Ramadi is.</i>

10:24.760 --> 10:27.797
- People give us names.

10:27.797 --> 10:30.566
And those names work
with the terrorists,

10:30.566 --> 10:33.269
<i>or they have weapons.</i>

10:33.269 --> 10:36.672
<i>They kick the door</i>
<i>when people sleeping.</i>

10:36.672 --> 10:37.940
- Get the [bleep] up!
- Get up!

10:37.940 --> 10:40.910
- Put it down!
You--put 'em down.

10:40.910 --> 10:42.712
- Get him back!
- [bleep]

10:42.712 --> 10:46.983
- Get--get the [bleep] down!
Go!

10:46.983 --> 10:52.121
<i>- They all scared,</i>
<i>they all scream, kids cry,</i>

10:52.121 --> 10:55.892
and I have to talk with them.

10:55.892 --> 10:58.094
<i>I try to do my best</i>

10:58.094 --> 11:00.897
<i>to tell the family everything</i>
<i>will be fine.</i>

11:00.897 --> 11:02.331
<i>They say,</i>
<i>"What are you guys doing?</i>

11:02.331 --> 11:05.234
It's wrong.
You guys are gonna kill us."

11:05.234 --> 11:07.970
<i>And if one of the names we</i>
<i>find,</i>

11:07.970 --> 11:11.574
<i>we have to handcuff him</i>
<i>and take him with us.</i>

11:11.574 --> 11:14.610
- You're going to jail tonight
for a very long time.

11:14.610 --> 11:18.681
<i>- Which is make all the girls</i>
<i>screaming loudly.</i>

11:18.681 --> 11:20.917
<i>They try to hold him.</i>

11:29.559 --> 11:32.028
<i>I have, as translator,</i>

11:32.028 --> 11:33.529
<i>to tell the Americans</i>

11:33.529 --> 11:37.033
what I feel about this
person--if he say the truth

11:37.033 --> 11:38.701
or he's lying.

11:38.701 --> 11:40.837
And I have to deal with this.

11:40.837 --> 11:44.407
<i>It's so difficult</i>
<i>to judge people.</i>

11:44.407 --> 11:46.576
<i>And what about</i>
<i>if my feeling is wrong,</i>

11:46.576 --> 11:48.344
<i>and he's a good guy?</i>

11:48.344 --> 11:50.046
What about if I think
he's a good guy,

11:50.046 --> 11:53.749
but he's not?

11:53.749 --> 11:55.952
<i>To be in the military</i>

11:55.952 --> 11:57.286
<i>is not easy,</i>

11:57.286 --> 12:01.057
<i>because I have</i>
<i>to deal with weapons,</i>

12:01.057 --> 12:03.559
<i>and I have to see dead bodies.</i>

12:03.559 --> 12:06.629
I see thousands of them.
I don't want to see them.

12:06.629 --> 12:07.730
<i>I don't want to see blood.</i>

12:07.730 --> 12:08.831
<i>I don't want to see knives</i>

12:08.831 --> 12:13.169
<i>or anything period--any human.</i>

12:16.472 --> 12:19.842
<i>I'm an artist. I like to make</i>
<i>people feel good.</i>

12:19.842 --> 12:21.677
<i>When they see flowers,</i>
<i>when they see</i>

12:21.677 --> 12:27.016
<i>beautiful, colorful</i>
<i>painting--that's how--</i>

12:27.016 --> 12:28.684
<i>that's how I am.</i>

12:28.684 --> 12:30.953
That's what's inside me.

12:40.830 --> 12:45.902
<i>Ramadi was the most</i>
<i>dangerous area in the world.</i>

12:47.837 --> 12:51.541
<i>I never thought I'm gonna</i>
<i>find a love in this place.</i>

13:11.961 --> 13:15.097
<i>When I first saw this Iraqi</i>
<i>soldier...</i>

13:18.468 --> 13:21.871
<i>It was afternoon,</i>
<i>and I still remember</i>

13:21.871 --> 13:26.375
<i>his black</i>
<i>hair shine with the sun.</i>

13:26.375 --> 13:28.678
<i>I go back,</i>
<i>and I tell my friend,</i>

13:28.678 --> 13:31.981
<i>"Oh, my God, I saw</i>
<i>the most handsome guy ever."</i>

14:08.751 --> 14:11.521
<i>- Because I'm translator,</i>
<i>everyone looking at me.</i>

14:11.521 --> 14:14.056
<i>Everyone want to talk with me,</i>
<i>because everyone</i>

14:14.056 --> 14:17.126
<i>want to know</i>
<i>more about the Americans.</i>

14:17.126 --> 14:20.229
So I thought Btoo
was just--when he look at me,

14:20.229 --> 14:22.899
<i>it's just like other soldiers.</i>

14:32.575 --> 14:36.379
<i>In 2005, we started going</i>
<i>to mission together.</i>

14:40.216 --> 14:44.387
And we stayed 15 days
in a house.

15:04.340 --> 15:05.708
- Oh, my God,
this cute guy,

15:05.708 --> 15:09.078
he start talking with me

15:09.078 --> 15:12.048
and inviting me for dinners.

15:16.018 --> 15:17.753
I just want to see him
every night,

15:17.753 --> 15:19.455
to talk and relax.

16:29.325 --> 16:33.062
<i>- One night in garden,</i>
<i>I start to talk with him</i>

16:33.062 --> 16:35.998
<i>about my friends.</i>

16:35.998 --> 16:38.434
<i>I not tell him details,</i>

16:38.434 --> 16:40.236
because I don't know

16:40.236 --> 16:42.038
if he's gay or not.

16:51.180 --> 16:53.883
- We were sitting next
to one of the Humvees,

16:53.883 --> 16:56.152
which is dark at night.

16:56.152 --> 16:58.054
Just the night visions
work there.

17:11.233 --> 17:12.568
- I look at him,
and he look at me.

17:12.568 --> 17:16.339
And after that,
we have first kiss.

17:48.471 --> 17:51.874
<i>- Before, I have been in Ramadi</i>
<i>to help my family.</i>

17:51.874 --> 17:53.309
<i>But after I meet Btoo,</i>

17:53.309 --> 17:55.745
<i>I'm staying</i>
<i>as translator in Ramadi</i>

17:55.745 --> 17:57.280
<i>just to be with him,</i>

17:57.280 --> 17:59.682
so I can see him every day.

18:04.754 --> 18:06.589
We go vacation together.

18:38.354 --> 18:39.989
<i>- So it's a war.</i>
<i>It's dangerous.</i>

18:39.989 --> 18:43.159
But I'm so excited,
because I'm with my boyfriend.

18:56.772 --> 18:58.708
Iraqi soldiers,
they have small encampment

18:58.708 --> 19:01.744
in camp separate from
the Americans.

20:02.331 --> 20:06.001
<i>- Every time we have mission,</i>
<i>I'm worried about him,</i>

20:06.001 --> 20:08.003
<i>if he's gonna</i>
<i>come back or not.</i>

20:11.807 --> 20:15.244
<i>I check his battalion to see</i>
<i>if he's back,</i>

20:15.244 --> 20:18.614
<i>if nothing's happened to him.</i>

20:18.614 --> 20:21.250
<i>Sometimes, I go</i>
<i>to the operation room,</i>

20:21.250 --> 20:24.687
<i>and I can hear his voice</i>
<i>about where he is</i>

20:24.687 --> 20:27.456
<i>or he's doing fine</i>
<i>or nothing happened to them.</i>

21:04.460 --> 21:07.163
- <i>One day, we was have</i>
<i>a foot patrol,</i>

21:07.163 --> 21:11.901
and there's just
dead cow in the street.

21:15.137 --> 21:16.906
- Pick it up.

21:16.906 --> 21:20.276
- The other soldiers
was walking in front of me,

21:20.276 --> 21:23.245
and--it fly.

21:23.245 --> 21:24.280
- Get up!
- Dust.

21:24.280 --> 21:25.281
- Get up!
- Shock.

21:25.281 --> 21:27.283
- Ahh!
- Get up!

21:27.283 --> 21:32.521
- My ears have this sound like.
[imitates beeping]

21:32.521 --> 21:35.891
There was IED bomb
inside the dead cow.

21:40.095 --> 21:41.997
- Go! Go!

21:41.997 --> 21:44.366
<i>- We have two soldier</i>
<i>killed in that time.</i>

21:44.366 --> 21:49.371
If I maybe go a few more feet,

21:49.371 --> 21:51.006
I may get killed.

22:11.427 --> 22:15.397
<i>With the days,</i>

22:15.397 --> 22:18.934
<i>with the years,</i>

22:18.934 --> 22:24.139
<i>with love, relationship</i>
<i>going more serious.</i>

22:24.139 --> 22:27.576
<i>But in all the time</i>
<i>spent in Ramadi,</i>

22:27.576 --> 22:32.181
<i>I still cannot tell him</i>
<i>my real name.</i>

22:32.181 --> 22:35.084
He still call me David

22:35.084 --> 22:37.820
<i>till 2008.</i>

22:45.794 --> 22:48.564
<i>My sister, she was</i>
<i>dying in a hospital.</i>

22:48.564 --> 22:51.667
I don't want him come,
meet my family,

22:51.667 --> 22:55.538
but I just want to see him
in same time.

22:55.538 --> 22:57.706
<i>I told him, "Please come."</i>

23:17.259 --> 23:19.061
- <i>He come from Baghdad</i>
<i>to Basra,</i>

23:19.061 --> 23:21.564
<i>which is long,</i>
<i>long hours drive.</i>

23:24.600 --> 23:27.203
<i>And I meet him at the hospital,</i>

23:27.203 --> 23:28.137
<i>and I cry.</i>

23:44.053 --> 23:46.655
- <i>When he come</i>
<i>and meet my family, me</i>

23:46.655 --> 23:48.524
<i>and him stayed in this hospital</i>

23:48.524 --> 23:51.794
<i>for 11 day,</i>
<i>till she die.</i>

23:51.794 --> 23:56.165
My mom, she already
lose a lot of the family.

23:56.165 --> 23:59.168
And before she go
to bring a lunch to us,

23:59.168 --> 24:02.171
she told me to take care
of my sister.

24:07.977 --> 24:09.845
How I gonna meet my mom,
tell her my sister,

24:09.845 --> 24:11.881
she die already?

24:14.984 --> 24:17.219
And my--

24:29.198 --> 24:33.202
She was
the most close person

24:33.202 --> 24:35.671
I can speak with.

24:35.671 --> 24:36.939
She loved me so much.

24:36.939 --> 24:41.844
And he hugged me,
make me calm down.

24:41.844 --> 24:44.980
<i>And that's when</i>
<i>my feelings get stronger.</i>

24:44.980 --> 24:47.383
<i>Because he's with me</i>
<i>in a bad situation,</i>

24:47.383 --> 24:50.352
not just in a good situation,
which make me--"Yes,

24:50.352 --> 24:56.058
this is the person I want to
spend all my rest life with."

24:56.058 --> 24:58.127
<i>So I told him my real name,</i>

24:58.127 --> 25:00.896
<i>where I'm from,</i>
<i>and why I lie to him.</i>

25:00.896 --> 25:03.399
And he said he know,

25:03.399 --> 25:07.136
and he completely understand
why I did this.

25:10.239 --> 25:12.875
<i>I feel like</i>
<i>a big problem just gone,</i>

25:12.875 --> 25:16.412
and now I'm honest,
and I'm free.

26:15.738 --> 26:19.074
- The situation
for gays in Iraq

26:19.074 --> 26:21.977
<i>changed to more bad</i>
<i>after Saddam.</i>

26:23.946 --> 26:25.514
<i>Muqtada al-Sadr, he's a son</i>

26:25.514 --> 26:28.417
<i>for one of the big</i>
<i>religious people Saddam killed.</i>

26:30.786 --> 26:34.089
<i>After the war,</i>
<i>when Americans come in, Muqtada</i>

26:34.089 --> 26:38.861
<i>make his own army</i>
<i>called Mahdi army.</i>

26:38.861 --> 26:41.463
<i>They judge people,</i>

26:41.463 --> 26:43.432
<i>killing them</i>
<i>for listening to music,</i>

26:43.432 --> 26:45.334
<i>killing them</i>
<i>for what they're wearing.</i>

26:45.334 --> 26:48.204
And that's also
what they did with gay guys.

26:55.511 --> 26:59.215
<i>In 2007, there was</i>
<i>a gay guy's birthday</i>

26:59.215 --> 27:03.118
<i>with a bunch of gay guys</i>
<i>belly dancing--</i>

27:03.118 --> 27:04.987
<i>very feminine and all that.</i>

27:04.987 --> 27:08.023
<i>They shot a video for fun.</i>

27:08.023 --> 27:10.426
This video get shared
all over Iraq,

27:10.426 --> 27:14.063
till someone
with the Mahdi army find out.

27:14.063 --> 27:17.700
Religious commanders
decide to make them example

27:17.700 --> 27:19.502
for the others.

27:24.673 --> 27:26.542
<i>They torture them.</i>

27:31.714 --> 27:33.415
<i>They kill them.</i>

27:35.751 --> 27:37.486
<i>They take videos</i>

27:37.486 --> 27:41.857
so everyone can see
what happens if you are gay.

28:08.217 --> 28:09.618
<i>- But all this situation</i>

28:09.618 --> 28:11.554
<i>is in fact</i>
<i>my relationship with Btoo,</i>

28:11.554 --> 28:14.356
<i>and what'll happen</i>
<i>if they find out about it.</i>

28:14.356 --> 28:17.092
<i>What'll happen</i>
<i>if his family find out?</i>

28:17.092 --> 28:18.694
<i>His family's</i>
<i>a religious family living</i>

28:18.694 --> 28:21.997
<i>in a very religious area</i>
<i>in Baghdad.</i>

28:21.997 --> 28:24.233
<i>What'll happen</i>
<i>if my family know</i>

28:24.233 --> 28:26.502
<i>and I give them shame?</i>

28:29.538 --> 28:30.906
<i>So I start thinking</i>

28:30.906 --> 28:33.709
<i>about a life outside Iraq.</i>

28:33.709 --> 28:35.444
<i>I'm thinking about the future.</i>

28:35.444 --> 28:40.483
I start to dream
I will marry Btoo one day,

28:40.483 --> 28:43.586
but this is gonna
be impossible in Iraq.

28:47.423 --> 28:50.993
I can't continue with him
or live with him here.

29:59.749 --> 30:04.254
- <i>So now it's time</i>
<i>to say good-bye for the family.</i>

30:04.254 --> 30:07.123
My mom, she was like,
"I lost your sister

30:07.123 --> 30:09.025
and now you."

30:09.025 --> 30:10.894
<i>So I was sitting in a taxi</i>

30:10.894 --> 30:12.762
<i>to take me to Baghdad,</i>

30:12.762 --> 30:17.400
<i>which is--Btoo</i>
<i>is waiting me there.</i>

30:17.400 --> 30:22.705
I saw her fall down
on the ground.

30:25.208 --> 30:28.244
Because she cannot stand
on her feet

30:28.244 --> 30:31.247
with her son leaving.

30:39.556 --> 30:40.623
<i>I think, like,</i>

30:40.623 --> 30:43.259
"I'm the bad person now here."

30:43.259 --> 30:47.363
And with all the pain my mom,

30:47.363 --> 30:51.267
she have, I give her more pain.

30:51.267 --> 30:54.837
<i>But I could not stay,</i>

30:54.837 --> 30:57.907
<i>because there's no future</i>
<i>for me and Btoo here.</i>

30:57.907 --> 31:01.110
<i>They're never gonna</i>
<i>let us live together.</i>

31:25.201 --> 31:27.437
- <i>We not sleep that night.</i>

31:27.437 --> 31:28.972
<i>And we was talking together,</i>

31:28.972 --> 31:32.642
<i>remember all the years</i>
<i>we spent in Iraq.</i>

31:32.642 --> 31:36.179
<i>And I was telling him,</i>
<i>"I'm not gonna forget you.</i>

31:36.179 --> 31:40.316
"I'm not gonna leave you.

31:40.316 --> 31:43.319
"I will do my best to get him

31:43.319 --> 31:45.121
as soon I could, behind me."

31:45.121 --> 31:46.422
And we could be together.

32:30.200 --> 32:31.968
- It's time
to say good-bye to him.

32:35.972 --> 32:40.343
I want to--I just want
to remember him exactly

32:40.343 --> 32:43.246
how he look.

32:43.246 --> 32:47.317
<i>The sun just coming out,</i>
<i>and I take this picture,</i>

32:47.317 --> 32:51.487
<i>and he have</i>

32:51.487 --> 32:53.756
<i>this very sad face.</i>

32:56.693 --> 33:00.430
And I hug him and tell him,

33:00.430 --> 33:04.634
<i>"We're gonna see</i>
<i>each other very soon,</i>

33:04.634 --> 33:06.502
<i>and we're gonna be together."</i>

33:25.388 --> 33:28.224
<i>I was thinking to go</i>
<i>to San Francisco first,</i>

33:28.224 --> 33:32.595
because they said it's
the capital of the gays.

33:32.595 --> 33:34.130
<i>But I have two friends.</i>

33:34.130 --> 33:35.932
<i>They already live in Seattle,</i>

33:35.932 --> 33:38.801
<i>and I move there</i>
<i>because they live there.</i>

33:49.913 --> 33:52.882
<i>And when I get to Seattle,</i>
<i>I land at night.</i>

33:52.882 --> 33:54.517
<i>I saw the city,</i>
<i>and I saw the downtown,</i>

33:54.517 --> 33:56.186
<i>and I was, like, in shock.</i>

33:56.186 --> 33:59.389
Oh my God, how beautiful.

33:59.389 --> 34:01.057
<i>That was my first time</i>

34:01.057 --> 34:05.562
<i>I saw that much big buildings.</i>

34:05.562 --> 34:07.697
<i>I saw the Space</i>
<i>Needle--it looked</i>

34:07.697 --> 34:11.801
<i>like 3-D movie--</i>
<i>and get excited.</i>

34:13.402 --> 34:17.139
<i>But my happiness</i>
<i>is not complete.</i>

34:17.139 --> 34:19.074
<i>I'm missing Btoo.</i>

35:30.613 --> 35:33.750
<i>- When I first come,</i>
<i>I speak with my caseworker,</i>

35:33.750 --> 35:36.319
<i>how I could bring</i>
<i>my boyfriend here.</i>

35:36.319 --> 35:38.454
<i>And she said it's difficult.</i>

35:38.454 --> 35:40.557
<i>He's not your husband.</i>

35:40.557 --> 35:42.225
<i>He's not your son or brother,</i>

35:42.225 --> 35:45.528
<i>so it's gonna</i>
<i>be difficult to bring him.</i>

36:33.743 --> 36:37.213
- <i>To make him not feel lonely,</i>
<i>I send him iPad</i>

36:37.213 --> 36:42.352
<i>so we can have</i>
<i>video chat any time, anywhere.</i>

36:42.352 --> 36:47.457
<i>I'll do anything just</i>
<i>at least touch him again</i>

36:47.457 --> 36:49.826
or see him again,
look at his eyes,

36:49.826 --> 36:51.628
or just to be inside him again.

36:51.628 --> 36:54.430
So I will do anything.

36:54.430 --> 36:58.167
<i>I write to Obama when he get</i>
<i>president first time.</i>

36:58.167 --> 37:00.436
<i>I tell him about Btoo.</i>

37:00.436 --> 37:02.839
<i>I even write to Oprah.</i>

37:02.839 --> 37:05.475
<i>She help a lot of people</i>
<i>and make them surprise.</i>

37:05.475 --> 37:07.143
And I was imagine Oprah,

37:07.143 --> 37:09.479
she bring Btoo to me,
and I surprise,

37:09.479 --> 37:12.615
and I find Btoo in front me.

37:17.086 --> 37:20.523
<i>But I'm getting more hopeless</i>

37:20.523 --> 37:24.227
<i>to not see him,</i>

37:24.227 --> 37:26.563
till I meet Michael.

37:31.935 --> 37:34.204
<i>I met Michael at a friend</i>
<i>party.</i>

37:34.204 --> 37:37.140
<i>I was telling him my story,</i>
<i>and he get interested.</i>

37:37.140 --> 37:39.375
He start helping me.

37:39.375 --> 37:41.644
<i>- My name is Michael Failla.</i>

37:41.644 --> 37:43.813
<i>I grew up in Michigan,</i>

37:43.813 --> 37:47.684
then I went and became
a psychologist.

37:47.684 --> 37:50.186
And then after that,
I became a chiropractor.

37:50.186 --> 37:53.389
<i>And then I started</i>
<i>a software company,</i>

37:53.389 --> 37:55.925
<i>which became big,</i>
<i>and I sold that last year.</i>

37:55.925 --> 37:59.028
And during the course
of my career,

37:59.028 --> 38:00.730
I also spent a lot of time

38:00.730 --> 38:03.867
helping refugees
from all over the world.

38:03.867 --> 38:07.070
<i>I began helping survivors</i>
<i>of the killing fields</i>

38:07.070 --> 38:08.438
<i>from Cambodia.</i>

38:08.438 --> 38:12.742
<i>Then I started helping</i>
<i>the Ethiopian community.</i>

38:12.742 --> 38:16.246
Before I met Nayyef,
I would occasionally hear

38:16.246 --> 38:19.048
about a execution

38:19.048 --> 38:22.051
of a gay person
in the Middle East.

38:22.051 --> 38:23.086
<i>But I didn't know</i>

38:23.086 --> 38:26.055
<i>how common executions were,</i>

38:26.055 --> 38:29.292
<i>because most of the executions</i>

38:29.292 --> 38:30.793
<i>aren't publicized,</i>

38:30.793 --> 38:33.663
because they're not carried out
by the government.

38:33.663 --> 38:35.498
The governments don't have to.

38:35.498 --> 38:38.935
The people do it themselves.

38:38.935 --> 38:41.905
<i>There's willing executioners</i>
<i>on every block</i>

38:41.905 --> 38:46.075
<i>in every neighborhood</i>
<i>who kill gay people,</i>

38:46.075 --> 38:50.914
<i>and the government just</i>
<i>sheds a blind eye toward it.</i>

38:50.914 --> 38:55.318
<i>So Btoo was living in</i>
<i>a tremendous amount of fear.</i>

38:59.022 --> 39:01.691
<i>When I met Nayyef,</i>
<i>they had pretty much exhausted</i>

39:01.691 --> 39:03.359
<i>most of their options</i>

39:03.359 --> 39:04.894
<i>to try to get him over legally.</i>

39:04.894 --> 39:06.196
- Okay,
we're gonna eat dinner.

39:06.196 --> 39:08.331
<i>- And they were pretty</i>
<i>hopeless.</i>

39:08.331 --> 39:11.701
Where there's a will,
there's a way,

39:11.701 --> 39:15.772
<i>so I just started looking</i>
<i>at all the different ways</i>

39:15.772 --> 39:17.941
<i>that we might be able</i>
<i>to get him out.</i>

39:24.534 --> 39:27.036
- I want to, when I open
my eyes--like before,

39:27.036 --> 39:29.005
when I open my eyes,
I see his face.

39:29.005 --> 39:31.007
So I make it huge,

39:31.007 --> 39:33.609
so when I--when I wake up
in the morning,

39:33.609 --> 39:36.712
like, the first thing I saw.

39:36.712 --> 39:38.981
I say, "Good morning,
Btoo."

40:56.292 --> 40:58.661
- <i>That was a very bad</i>
<i>situation for us,</i>

40:58.661 --> 41:01.764
<i>because if he get married,</i>
<i>he'd have to stay there.</i>

41:01.764 --> 41:02.765
<i>And also, in that time,</i>

41:02.765 --> 41:07.770
<i>his brother find out about us.</i>

41:07.770 --> 41:11.040
<i>He called me, and he said,</i>
<i>"What do you want</i>

41:11.040 --> 41:12.308
<i>from my brother?"</i>

41:39.735 --> 41:41.838
<i>- Faced with this information,</i>

41:41.838 --> 41:46.209
I said, "Btoo needs to desert
the military today.

41:46.209 --> 41:48.845
<i>Get out of Iraq."</i>

41:51.180 --> 41:53.115
<i>Lebanon was our place of</i>
<i>choice,</i>

41:53.115 --> 41:56.185
<i>because you can get</i>
<i>a 30-day tourist visa</i>

41:56.185 --> 41:59.222
<i>if you're an Iraqi.</i>

41:59.222 --> 42:02.325
So I wired Btoo the money,

42:02.325 --> 42:06.762
we got him 30 days
of hotel bills paid,

42:06.762 --> 42:10.132
<i>and we got him</i>
<i>a round-trip airline ticket</i>

42:10.132 --> 42:12.468
<i>between Baghdad and Beirut.</i>

42:27.817 --> 42:31.053
<i>- I was very worried.</i>
<i>I was calling him all the time.</i>

42:31.053 --> 42:32.522
<i>"Okay, did you get the ticket?</i>

42:32.522 --> 42:34.390
<i>Be careful.</i>
<i>This is last chance for us.</i>

42:34.390 --> 42:36.459
<i>Don't tell anyone</i>
<i>where you're going."</i>

43:34.317 --> 43:37.320
- <i>I was awake all the night.</i>

43:37.320 --> 43:40.323
<i>He called me around 3:00</i>
<i>in the morning.</i>

43:40.323 --> 43:41.858
<i>He said, "I'm safe.</i>

43:41.858 --> 43:43.626
<i>I'm in Lebanon now."</i>

43:43.626 --> 43:46.562
I was crying and screaming.
I said, "Are you sure?

43:46.562 --> 43:51.100
Take a picture and send it to me
so I can believe you."

43:51.100 --> 43:53.135
<i>He did that for me.</i>

43:53.135 --> 43:55.505
<i>He left everything,</i>

43:55.505 --> 43:58.341
<i>because we dreaming</i>
<i>all the time</i>

43:58.341 --> 44:00.109
<i>to build our future.</i>

44:00.109 --> 44:02.144
<i>And he did it,</i>
<i>and he get out.</i>

44:02.144 --> 44:05.047
So that was a huge, big moment
for us.

45:01.070 --> 45:05.208
<i>- After Btoo was safely</i>
<i>in Beirut,</i>

45:05.208 --> 45:08.211
I made an application for him

45:08.211 --> 45:10.146
<i>for refugee status</i>

45:10.146 --> 45:13.182
<i>with the UNHCR office in</i>
<i>Beirut.</i>

45:13.182 --> 45:17.086
<i>The UNHCR stands</i>
<i>for the United Nations</i>

45:17.086 --> 45:20.256
<i>High Commission for Refugees.</i>

45:20.256 --> 45:22.725
<i>Essentially, what happens is,</i>

45:22.725 --> 45:24.694
<i>if you escape</i>
<i>from another country</i>

45:24.694 --> 45:27.396
<i>and you end up</i>
<i>illegally someplace else,</i>

45:27.396 --> 45:30.833
<i>if you want to become resettled</i>
<i>to another country,</i>

45:30.833 --> 45:34.770
<i>you have to apply</i>
<i>for refugee status first.</i>

45:34.770 --> 45:40.376
<i>And so the UNHCR screens</i>
<i>refugees for resettlement.</i>

45:40.376 --> 45:44.146
The UNHCR accepts people

45:44.146 --> 45:45.515
who prove to them

45:45.515 --> 45:48.818
that they have
to flee their country.

45:48.818 --> 45:52.255
<i>But one mistake</i>
<i>in interpretation</i>

45:52.255 --> 45:55.324
<i>can mean</i>
<i>that person is finished.</i>

45:55.324 --> 45:56.492
Their life might be over.

45:56.492 --> 45:57.860
They might end up
being sent back

45:57.860 --> 46:00.730
and being killed
in the country that they fled.

46:13.809 --> 46:16.445
<i>- The new Hezbollah-backed</i>
<i>prime minister of Lebanon</i>

46:16.445 --> 46:17.980
<i>has begun to form his cabinet,</i>

46:17.980 --> 46:20.416
<i>following two days</i>
<i>of widespread protests.</i>

46:20.416 --> 46:23.052
<i>Thousands of Sunni Muslims</i>
<i>poured onto the streets,</i>

46:23.052 --> 46:25.188
<i>burning tires, throwing rocks,</i>

46:25.188 --> 46:26.789
<i>and accusing the militant group</i>

46:26.789 --> 46:27.790
<i>of a coup.</i>

46:46.275 --> 46:47.810
<i>- We set off</i>
<i>early in the morning</i>

46:47.810 --> 46:52.481
for his meeting
at UNHCR headquarters.

46:52.481 --> 46:55.952
<i>There were checkpoints</i>
<i>all across the city,</i>

46:55.952 --> 46:58.187
<i>so it was very, very hard</i>

46:58.187 --> 47:00.623
<i>to get to the UNHCR offices,</i>

47:00.623 --> 47:02.391
<i>because Btoo was illegal.</i>

47:02.391 --> 47:04.727
He couldn't make it
through a checkpoint.

47:04.727 --> 47:07.296
I have a U.S. passport
and an Irish passport.

47:07.296 --> 47:09.098
I can get
through any checkpoint.

47:09.098 --> 47:10.800
<i>But Btoo,</i>
<i>if he had been caught,</i>

47:10.800 --> 47:12.502
<i>he could've been</i>
<i>sent back to Iraq,</i>

47:12.502 --> 47:14.370
<i>where he would've been killed.</i>

47:21.388 --> 47:22.956
- <i>After some difficulty,</i>

47:22.956 --> 47:27.628
<i>we made it</i>
<i>to the UNHCR headquarters.</i>

47:28.929 --> 47:31.432
<i>Finally, about 4:00</i>
<i>in the afternoon,</i>

47:31.432 --> 47:33.500
<i>they called Btoo's name.</i>

47:33.500 --> 47:36.470
<i>The interviewer told me</i>
<i>that I could not accompany him,</i>

47:36.470 --> 47:38.005
<i>so I said to the interviewer,</i>

47:38.005 --> 47:40.340
<i>"One of the things</i>
<i>I want you to understand</i>

47:40.340 --> 47:43.977
"is that Btoo
is being persecuted,

47:43.977 --> 47:46.046
"and his life is threatened,

47:46.046 --> 47:47.781
because he is gay."

47:47.781 --> 47:50.184
And the UNHCR interviewer
looked at me.

47:50.184 --> 47:55.155
He says, "We don't
care about gays here.

47:55.155 --> 47:58.292
<i>Gays are not our priority."</i>

47:58.292 --> 48:00.327
<i>And then Btoo was taken back</i>

48:00.327 --> 48:01.662
<i>for his interview.</i>

48:48.275 --> 48:52.279
- When I heard from Btoo,
I was feeling very, very bad.

48:52.279 --> 48:53.580
<i>He's a soldier.</i>

48:53.580 --> 48:54.948
<i>He's gay.</i>
<i>He's in danger.</i>

48:54.948 --> 48:58.052
But do you think
this is important for the UN?

48:58.052 --> 48:59.319
I'm not sure.

49:54.041 --> 49:55.843
<i>- With the situation</i>
<i>he's living in,</i>

49:55.843 --> 49:59.646
<i>running away from the soldiers</i>
<i>and from checkpoints,</i>

49:59.646 --> 50:02.282
it's very difficult to show him,

50:02.282 --> 50:04.018
like, "Oh, look how I live."

50:04.018 --> 50:06.286
But in the same time,
I was telling him

50:06.286 --> 50:07.888
how we could live.

50:10.591 --> 50:12.593
<i>Skype was very important</i>
<i>for us,</i>

50:12.593 --> 50:14.762
<i>because we could see each other</i>

50:14.762 --> 50:16.930
<i>and feel</i>
<i>like we're living together,</i>

50:16.930 --> 50:18.432
<i>but--we not really</i>
<i>live together,</i>

50:18.432 --> 50:20.934
<i>but how is our life will be.</i>

50:56.303 --> 50:57.571
- I wish he can be with me

50:57.571 --> 51:00.107
and holding each other.

51:00.107 --> 51:02.776
<i>This was gay pride,</i>
<i>and they put the rainbow flag</i>

51:02.776 --> 51:05.145
in the top of the Space Needle
for three days.

51:05.145 --> 51:06.480
And I was like,

51:06.480 --> 51:09.283
"That--they really
like gays here," you know?

51:09.283 --> 51:11.185
And I was like,
"Oh, my God."

51:11.185 --> 51:12.920
And I was, like, feeling myself,

51:12.920 --> 51:14.388
like I'm proud
that I'm gay,

51:14.388 --> 51:17.291
whatever--you know,
something like not usual to me.

51:17.291 --> 51:20.361
And you see
all those thousands people,

51:20.361 --> 51:22.229
they're just proud
that they're gay.

51:22.229 --> 51:24.465
And I danced all the day.

51:24.465 --> 51:26.233
I look like slut here.

51:26.233 --> 51:30.771
When we're separate,
I start doing music video.

51:35.242 --> 51:36.810
<i>I want a way to show him</i>

51:36.810 --> 51:39.713
<i>what's going on</i>
<i>for me without him.</i>

52:46.280 --> 52:48.415
- I'm waiting tomorrow
to finish,

52:48.415 --> 52:52.853
not just today.

52:52.853 --> 52:56.290
I just want--want to hope.

52:56.290 --> 52:57.691
I just want to close my eyes

52:57.691 --> 53:00.661
and open my eyes,
and I saw you next to me.

53:02.796 --> 53:04.164
I don't want anything else.

53:04.164 --> 53:07.501
When he feel lonely
and get drunk and cry,

53:07.501 --> 53:09.503
I always feel like I'm guilty.

53:09.503 --> 53:11.071
I put him in this.

53:21.482 --> 53:23.250
I not care about my family.

53:23.250 --> 53:26.086
I not care about travel.
I not care to Baghdad.

53:26.086 --> 53:27.521
I just care about to see you

53:27.521 --> 53:31.725
and miss you--this the important
things.

53:37.765 --> 53:41.502
I feel like someone just
hold my hands and my legs

53:41.502 --> 53:42.669
and I cannot move anymore,

53:42.669 --> 53:44.038
when I see him like this.

53:49.243 --> 53:52.379
I want to just hug him.

53:52.379 --> 53:55.315
He would feel better.
He would feel safe, you know?

53:55.315 --> 53:59.453
So this is what make
me--killing me every day,

53:59.453 --> 54:01.355
and try to fight
to do anything

54:01.355 --> 54:03.857
just to get him--to get him
from there.

54:22.322 --> 54:26.159
- Btoo had several interviews
during his refugee process.

54:26.159 --> 54:30.697
<i>And the UNHCR</i>
<i>has such a huge job to do,</i>

54:30.697 --> 54:32.432
<i>because almost all refugees</i>

54:32.432 --> 54:35.068
<i>who are seeking asylum</i>
<i>to another country</i>

54:35.068 --> 54:36.403
<i>through the UNHCR</i>

54:36.403 --> 54:39.373
<i>and--sometimes</i>
<i>those waves of refugees</i>

54:39.373 --> 54:41.642
<i>are beyond what</i>
<i>they can handle.</i>

54:41.642 --> 54:43.677
So we were waiting,

54:43.677 --> 54:45.112
and we were waiting.

54:51.018 --> 54:53.887
- That's my Christmas--just me

54:53.887 --> 54:58.625
and this tree--and I don't know

54:58.625 --> 55:00.060
what I have to do.

55:04.431 --> 55:07.501
<i>- And we were waiting,</i>
<i>and we were waiting.</i>

55:13.807 --> 55:15.642
<i>Finally, the UNHCR office</i>

55:15.642 --> 55:19.413
told me that Btoo was
being recommended for exclusion.

55:23.951 --> 55:26.253
<i>Exclusion means</i>
<i>that his application</i>

55:26.253 --> 55:30.991
<i>will never be accepted</i>
<i>for resettlement as a refugee.</i>

55:30.991 --> 55:32.826
<i>And then they finally</i>
<i>said that,</i>

55:32.826 --> 55:36.063
<i>because of some things that he</i>
<i>had said in his interview,</i>

55:36.063 --> 55:37.564
that they thought
that he may

55:37.564 --> 55:41.268
have been
a witness to torture.

55:41.268 --> 55:42.936
<i>And they could never</i>
<i>accept somebody</i>

55:42.936 --> 55:46.239
<i>who was aware of torture</i>
<i>happening in a military unit</i>

55:46.239 --> 55:47.474
<i>that they served in,</i>

55:47.474 --> 55:49.843
or if they were
a witness to torture,

55:49.843 --> 55:52.446
they would be considered
a war criminal.

55:52.446 --> 55:54.548
Hello?

55:54.548 --> 55:57.484
<i>I asked them</i>
<i>to send me the transcripts,</i>

55:57.484 --> 56:00.020
<i>and they refused to send me</i>
<i>the transcripts,</i>

56:00.020 --> 56:06.059
so I started calling
and emailing the UNHCR

56:06.059 --> 56:09.196
<i>and kept requesting</i>
<i>another interview.</i>

56:09.196 --> 56:11.465
Everybody's afraid to get
this one interviewer.

56:11.465 --> 56:13.133
They're afraid that
she will say

56:13.133 --> 56:14.935
that they said things
that they didn't say.

56:14.935 --> 56:16.036
- It's been two years,

56:16.036 --> 56:17.571
and any time he will be caught

56:17.571 --> 56:20.040
by the police or the army
and sent back to Iraq,

56:20.040 --> 56:22.109
and he'll be killed
by his tribe and family.

56:22.109 --> 56:23.844
They're all looking for him.

56:23.844 --> 56:27.547
So I-I would love
the UN in Seattle

56:27.547 --> 56:30.083
to help us in this case.

56:32.819 --> 56:35.989
<i>This is--this is terrible.</i>

56:35.989 --> 56:37.457
This is terrible.

56:37.457 --> 56:40.460
He have to be with me,
or I have to be with him.

56:40.460 --> 56:43.430
- We're looking forward
to hearing what you have to say.

56:43.430 --> 56:48.201
<i>The UNHCR process</i>
<i>was looking pretty hopeless.</i>

56:48.201 --> 56:50.704
I knew we needed a plan B.

56:57.377 --> 57:00.447
<i>I heard of a program in Canada</i>

57:00.447 --> 57:03.850
<i>where you could get</i>
<i>a group of sponsors together</i>

57:03.850 --> 57:07.120
<i>who would pledge to be</i>
<i>responsible for that person.</i>

57:07.120 --> 57:09.423
If that person
had medical problems,

57:09.423 --> 57:11.658
they would cover
those medical problems.

57:11.658 --> 57:14.761
If that person
had--got into any trouble

57:14.761 --> 57:17.698
with the government,
they would be responsible.

57:17.698 --> 57:21.635
<i>So I contacted some</i>
<i>of my friends up in Vancouver</i>

57:21.635 --> 57:23.503
<i>who agreed</i>
<i>to participate in this,</i>

57:23.503 --> 57:25.372
<i>and we got</i>
<i>the paperwork rolling.</i>

57:25.372 --> 57:28.175
And then, once again,
we were waiting.

57:39.453 --> 57:41.822
<i>- I was like,</i>
<i>"Oh my God,</i>

57:41.822 --> 57:44.358
<i>I have to be with him</i>
<i>in interview."</i>

57:44.358 --> 57:47.561
And Michael, he said,
"Happy birthday.

57:47.561 --> 57:50.364
I have a ticket
for you to go see Btoo."

57:53.200 --> 57:57.571
And that was most happy news

57:57.571 --> 57:58.639
I ever get.

58:02.142 --> 58:03.543
There's a lot
of stuff I buy him.

58:03.543 --> 58:05.078
See, I buy him this.
He'll love it.

58:05.078 --> 58:08.949
The grey and the blue is the
most favor--his favorite colors.

58:08.949 --> 58:10.384
And it's with feathers,

58:10.384 --> 58:12.185
so he like that stuff.

58:12.185 --> 58:13.754
I love the underwears
in America.

58:13.754 --> 58:16.890
And you go--they just
stretch with your body,

58:16.890 --> 58:19.693
make your shape.

58:19.693 --> 58:24.097
I get him shoes and something
he can wear in the home

58:24.097 --> 58:26.400
so he not feel cold.

58:26.400 --> 58:30.304
I have this, so I can sleep
in the--in the airplane.

58:32.239 --> 58:33.807
We're seeing Btoo.

58:33.807 --> 58:35.976
My feeling is so weird.

58:35.976 --> 58:38.245
It is like--it's like missing,

58:38.245 --> 58:40.180
happy, scared.

58:40.180 --> 58:41.615
<i>It's a lot together.</i>

59:49.816 --> 59:51.451
I tell him,

59:51.451 --> 59:53.253
"You look--you look so big.

59:53.253 --> 59:54.488
What are you eating?"

01:00:04.331 --> 01:00:07.467
I told him,
"There's no Skyping anymore."

01:00:07.467 --> 01:00:09.336
We don't need Skyping.

01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:37.527
<i>- If you answer</i>
<i>any of this wrong,</i>

01:00:37.527 --> 01:00:41.931
even a little bit,

01:00:41.931 --> 01:00:44.334
they will exclude you.

01:00:44.334 --> 01:00:46.369
Now, Mr. Sinan,

01:00:46.369 --> 01:00:51.040
did you ever
arrest any terrorists?

01:01:01.718 --> 01:01:05.455
- Never,
never cross your arms.

01:01:05.455 --> 01:01:08.825
Okay, so this is what
they're saying you said.

01:01:08.825 --> 01:01:13.062
During the interrogations
or the questioning,

01:01:13.062 --> 01:01:17.133
they were subjected
to very harsh treatments

01:01:17.133 --> 01:01:19.836
that could amount occasionally
to torture.

01:01:58.708 --> 01:02:02.112
- Okay, this answer was close,
but not like this.

01:02:05.181 --> 01:02:06.850
- Nope.

01:02:09.152 --> 01:02:11.688
You sound angry.

01:02:11.688 --> 01:02:14.824
- So his answer was
what makes this a problem,

01:02:14.824 --> 01:02:17.360
because he not say,
"No, they not,"

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:19.195
and he not say,

01:02:19.195 --> 01:02:20.263
"No, I don't know."

01:02:20.263 --> 01:02:21.965
He say, "I'm not sure

01:02:21.965 --> 01:02:24.367
if they--this is not
my responsibility."

01:02:24.367 --> 01:02:26.102
So if you answer
someone like this,

01:02:26.102 --> 01:02:29.372
he will think,
you know, something's up.

01:02:29.372 --> 01:02:30.907
- Yeah,
so that is the problem.

01:02:30.907 --> 01:02:33.943
So let's talk about
how we get around that problem.

01:02:33.943 --> 01:02:36.746
So the answer here--you know,

01:02:36.746 --> 01:02:41.885
he was never aware of anybody

01:02:41.885 --> 01:02:43.753
that the people
that he handed over

01:02:43.753 --> 01:02:45.188
or anything
that he was involved with

01:02:45.188 --> 01:02:47.524
or anything with his group--that
he was ever aware

01:02:47.524 --> 01:02:49.426
of any harsh treatment
or torture.

01:02:49.426 --> 01:02:51.461
Who arrested the prisoners?

01:02:55.698 --> 01:02:58.601
- The coalition forces.
- American forces, okay.

01:02:58.601 --> 01:02:59.803
Where did they take them?

01:03:05.341 --> 01:03:09.212
- He said--okay.

01:03:19.823 --> 01:03:23.126
- They are going to try
to get you emotional.

01:03:23.126 --> 01:03:26.596
You cannot get emotional.

01:03:26.596 --> 01:03:29.365
You have to turn on the charm.

01:03:29.365 --> 01:03:30.900
When you get angry, you know.

01:03:39.843 --> 01:03:41.778
So if this person
doesn't like you,

01:03:41.778 --> 01:03:44.981
this person
has the power to say,

01:03:44.981 --> 01:03:48.685
"I'm going to exclude you."

01:03:48.685 --> 01:03:52.655
You can do this tomorrow,

01:03:52.655 --> 01:03:57.026
but you need to do it tomorrow

01:03:57.026 --> 01:03:59.763
with a smile,

01:03:59.763 --> 01:04:03.733
good eye contact,

01:04:03.733 --> 01:04:05.568
love in your heart.

01:04:09.773 --> 01:04:13.209
If you start to--if
you start to find

01:04:13.209 --> 01:04:19.415
yourself getting nervous...

01:04:19.415 --> 01:04:21.484
Stop.

01:04:21.484 --> 01:04:28.358
It's better to be silent

01:04:28.358 --> 01:04:29.826
than to be angry.

01:04:34.697 --> 01:04:39.169
Tonight, you guys enjoy, relax.

01:04:39.169 --> 01:04:41.771
No alcohol--no alcohol,

01:04:41.771 --> 01:04:45.141
but lots of sex and lots
of massage tonight.

01:04:48.978 --> 01:04:51.014
But I also want you rested.

01:05:04.561 --> 01:05:09.999
<i>We arrive at UNHCR offices.</i>

01:05:09.999 --> 01:05:13.336
<i>The office is a beehive filled</i>
<i>with mostly Syrian refugees</i>

01:05:13.336 --> 01:05:15.138
<i>who were fleeing</i>
<i>the civil war in Syria.</i>

01:05:15.138 --> 01:05:18.374
So we were in a very,
very tiny room

01:05:18.374 --> 01:05:20.910
with paper-thin walls.

01:05:20.910 --> 01:05:22.612
<i>We had expected</i>
<i>that the interview</i>

01:05:22.612 --> 01:05:25.348
<i>was going to last</i>
<i>about 3 hours,</i>

01:05:25.348 --> 01:05:30.487
but the interview lasted
a total of 11 hours.

01:05:30.487 --> 01:05:36.059
During the interview, he went
through Btoo's entire history,

01:05:36.059 --> 01:05:37.660
from as a child.

01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:39.896
And then he focused in
exclusively,

01:05:39.896 --> 01:05:42.098
almost month-by-month

01:05:42.098 --> 01:05:46.870
<i>on Btoo's entire</i>
<i>military history.</i>

01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:51.508
I had been wondering
and asking for months

01:05:51.508 --> 01:05:53.076
and months and months,

01:05:53.076 --> 01:05:57.013
<i>"Why do you believe that he was</i>
<i>a witness to torture?"</i>

01:05:57.013 --> 01:05:59.849
<i>In the interview,</i>
<i>it became clear to me,</i>

01:05:59.849 --> 01:06:01.885
what they had believed

01:06:01.885 --> 01:06:04.587
and what a previous interviewer

01:06:04.587 --> 01:06:07.323
had said
about Btoo was

01:06:07.323 --> 01:06:10.193
that he had been
a witness to the torture

01:06:10.193 --> 01:06:13.329
in Abu Ghraib
by the United States.

01:06:17.434 --> 01:06:19.235
It turned out that,

01:06:19.235 --> 01:06:21.938
<i>in an earlier interview</i>
<i>two years before,</i>

01:06:21.938 --> 01:06:23.673
<i>when he was first applying,</i>

01:06:23.673 --> 01:06:26.810
<i>they asked him</i>
<i>if he had ever known</i>

01:06:26.810 --> 01:06:29.179
<i>or seen anything of Abu Ghraib.</i>

01:06:29.179 --> 01:06:34.884
<i>And he explained that he had</i>
<i>gone into the American office</i>

01:06:34.884 --> 01:06:39.923
<i>and saw that on a monitor--on</i>
<i>a TV screen.</i>

01:06:39.923 --> 01:06:43.560
And the interviewer told that

01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:46.196
in her story about Btoo,

01:06:46.196 --> 01:06:50.967
but she left out that he saw it
on a news report.

01:06:50.967 --> 01:06:55.004
<i>She made it sound</i>
<i>like he saw it in person.</i>

01:06:55.004 --> 01:06:58.174
<i>And so for this reason,</i>

01:06:58.174 --> 01:07:00.977
<i>they had recommended him</i>
<i>for exclusion.</i>

01:07:34.844 --> 01:07:36.613
- Here his only knowledge

01:07:36.613 --> 01:07:38.882
all along about Abu Ghraib

01:07:38.882 --> 01:07:40.583
was a news report

01:07:40.583 --> 01:07:42.418
that he had seen in an office

01:07:42.418 --> 01:07:45.288
<i>on a television screen</i>
<i>on the American base.</i>

01:08:07.043 --> 01:08:09.078
<i>- We know that</i>
<i>his military history,</i>

01:08:09.078 --> 01:08:10.580
<i>and the records of</i>
<i>where he was at,</i>

01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:14.417
<i>does not put him anywhere</i>
<i>near Abu Ghraib.</i>

01:08:14.417 --> 01:08:18.321
And after 11 hours,
we left the interview,

01:08:18.321 --> 01:08:20.156
and it was up
to the interviewer.

01:08:20.156 --> 01:08:24.327
We didn't know
whether he believed Btoo

01:08:24.327 --> 01:08:26.328
or whether
he didn't believe Btoo.

01:10:35.116 --> 01:10:36.584
<i>- He called me at 3:00 in</i>
<i>the morning,</i>

01:10:36.584 --> 01:10:38.753
and he's saying,
"I got accepted."

01:10:38.753 --> 01:10:40.221
I said, "What do you mean,
you got accepted?"

01:10:40.221 --> 01:10:42.256
He said, "I got
accepted in Canada."

01:10:46.494 --> 01:10:47.962
<i>I said, "Are you kidding?</i>

01:10:47.962 --> 01:10:50.365
This is not gonna be happening
in one interview."

01:10:50.365 --> 01:10:54.135
We've been all these years,
fighting with the UN.

01:11:00.441 --> 01:11:03.111
- Oh my God, he's
almost one step away.

01:11:03.111 --> 01:11:05.346
- Hey.

01:11:05.346 --> 01:11:08.483
<i>- And I call Michael</i>
<i>around 5:00 in the morning,</i>

01:11:08.483 --> 01:11:10.518
<i>and I told him what's</i>
<i>happening.</i>

01:11:13.788 --> 01:11:14.989
I cannot believe it.

01:11:14.989 --> 01:11:16.591
- Oh, wow.
- I cannot believe it.

01:11:16.591 --> 01:11:18.359
- Best news--
the best news ever.

01:11:18.359 --> 01:11:21.929
- I know, it's the best news
ever. This is Btoo.

01:11:21.929 --> 01:11:25.466
- Oh, Btoo! Hey, Btoo.

01:11:25.466 --> 01:11:28.803
How are you?
Congratulations.

01:11:33.307 --> 01:11:34.575
- How are you?

01:11:34.575 --> 01:11:36.077
I am fine.

01:11:36.077 --> 01:11:41.182
But [indistinct]
has the flow.

01:11:41.182 --> 01:11:43.384
- Flu.
- Flu.

01:11:43.384 --> 01:11:45.486
- I start counting how many days

01:11:45.486 --> 01:11:49.891
left till he will come
and live in Canada.

01:11:49.891 --> 01:11:52.894
- How is your family?

01:11:52.894 --> 01:11:56.898
We are all fine.

01:11:56.898 --> 01:11:58.700
- Very good.

01:12:46.748 --> 01:12:50.084
<i>The moment I saw him</i>
<i>in the--in the airport,</i>

01:12:50.084 --> 01:12:53.588
<i>that was a big,</i>
<i>beautiful moment.</i>

01:12:53.588 --> 01:12:56.591
<i>I was the most happy person</i>
<i>in my life.</i>

01:13:12.006 --> 01:13:13.908
- So you're finally together.

01:13:17.211 --> 01:13:18.780
- Yes, we are.

01:13:41.035 --> 01:13:42.437
- Here's your new home.

01:13:47.308 --> 01:13:48.543
Pretty beautiful, huh?

01:13:56.317 --> 01:13:57.885
- And life
is gonna be

01:13:57.885 --> 01:13:59.220
what you make of it.

01:14:17.538 --> 01:14:19.907
- Of course, every immigrant
has an amazing story

01:14:19.907 --> 01:14:22.310
about their journey here
to the United States.

01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:23.644
But we talked to a man

01:14:23.644 --> 01:14:27.215
who made it all the way
here from war-torn Iraq.

01:14:27.215 --> 01:14:29.317
<i>We first spotted Nayyef Hrebid</i>

01:14:29.317 --> 01:14:31.052
<i>waving the flag</i>
<i>of his new country.</i>

01:14:31.052 --> 01:14:33.988
<i>He escaped to here after</i>
<i>working as an interpreter</i>

01:14:33.988 --> 01:14:36.491
<i>for the United States</i>
<i>military in Iraq.</i>

01:14:36.491 --> 01:14:38.660
- I hereby declare on oath,

01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:42.864
each of you is a citizen
of the United States of America.

01:14:42.864 --> 01:14:44.265
Congratulations.

01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:54.583
<i>- Since Btoo</i>
<i>started living in Canada,</i>

01:14:54.583 --> 01:14:57.552
I've been going there
every single week

01:14:57.552 --> 01:14:59.955
<i>and focus all my vacations</i>

01:14:59.955 --> 01:15:02.457
<i>and everything</i>
<i>to be with him.</i>

01:15:26.548 --> 01:15:27.816
He said yes!

01:15:27.816 --> 01:15:30.652
[cheers and applause]

01:15:30.652 --> 01:15:32.988
Since me and Btoo are safe now,

01:15:32.988 --> 01:15:37.025
<i>we decide to help</i>
<i>other people come here.</i>

01:15:51.706 --> 01:15:54.476
<i>The situation now</i>
<i>in Middle East</i>

01:15:54.476 --> 01:15:58.280
is going more bad and bad,

01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:00.649
<i>especially from the IS</i>

01:16:00.649 --> 01:16:02.484
<i>and from militias.</i>

01:16:02.484 --> 01:16:04.152
<i>They all against gays,</i>

01:16:04.152 --> 01:16:07.088
<i>and they would do anything</i>
<i>to destroy them.</i>

01:16:54.736 --> 01:17:00.976
- We need a new generation
to change the thinking

01:17:00.976 --> 01:17:04.579
<i>about gay people</i>
<i>in Middle East.</i>

01:17:04.579 --> 01:17:07.015
<i>We're not like</i>
<i>what they're saying.</i>

01:17:07.015 --> 01:17:09.718
<i>We're not bad.</i>
<i>We're not evil.</i>

01:17:09.718 --> 01:17:11.686
<i>We're just normal people.</i>

01:17:11.686 --> 01:17:13.288
<i>That's the way</i>
<i>how we're born,</i>

01:17:13.288 --> 01:17:17.492
<i>and that's the way--how</i>
<i>we want to live.</i>

01:17:17.492 --> 01:17:19.561
They're not gonna stop us.

01:17:38.079 --> 01:17:42.117
<i>- Btoo and Nayyef have one of</i>
<i>the most beautiful love affairs</i>

01:17:42.117 --> 01:17:43.451
<i>I've ever seen.</i>

01:17:43.451 --> 01:17:47.322
What's unique
about Nayyef and Btoo

01:17:47.322 --> 01:17:49.824
is their bravery.

01:17:49.824 --> 01:17:51.126
<i>I can't tell you.</i>

01:17:51.126 --> 01:17:54.396
<i>I feel so happy</i>
<i>that I was a part</i>

01:17:54.396 --> 01:17:58.400
of helping them have
a new life together--a life

01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:00.168
that they deserve.

01:18:04.039 --> 01:18:05.740
<i>- I've been dreaming</i>
<i>about the wedding</i>

01:18:05.740 --> 01:18:07.075
<i>since a long, long time ago.</i>

01:18:07.075 --> 01:18:10.412
And finally, we get
to make our life

01:18:10.412 --> 01:18:11.613
how we dream it.

01:18:35.437 --> 01:18:39.641
- I promise you to love you,

01:18:39.641 --> 01:18:42.177
protect you,

01:18:42.177 --> 01:18:43.311
honor you,

01:18:43.311 --> 01:18:45.947
and respect you

01:18:45.947 --> 01:18:49.384
for the rest of my life.

01:18:49.384 --> 01:18:50.719
I love you.

01:18:50.719 --> 01:18:53.421
- It's been 10 1/2 years.

01:18:53.421 --> 01:18:55.924
Four years
of them was very difficult.

01:18:55.924 --> 01:18:57.826
But there was never
a time I thought,

01:18:57.826 --> 01:19:01.496
"It's not gonna be worth it."

01:19:01.496 --> 01:19:05.901
This relationship has shown me
what love can be.

01:19:05.901 --> 01:19:07.903
I love you so much.

01:19:18.914 --> 01:19:22.851
Yours is big.

01:19:22.851 --> 01:19:24.853
- By the power vested in me

01:19:24.853 --> 01:19:27.289
and by the state of Washington,

01:19:27.289 --> 01:19:29.491
I pronounce you married.

01:19:29.491 --> 01:19:32.427
[cheers and applause]

01:20:16.171 --> 01:20:18.406
<i>- The funny--every time</i>
<i>I dreamed about something</i>

01:20:18.406 --> 01:20:20.075
<i>I wish, it happens.</i>

01:20:20.075 --> 01:20:23.078
<i>I wanted to get accepted</i>
<i>to fine art college.</i>

01:20:23.078 --> 01:20:24.279
I did.

01:20:24.279 --> 01:20:25.714
<i>When the war start,</i>
<i>I dreamed about</i>

01:20:25.714 --> 01:20:28.283
living in United States,
and I did.

01:20:28.283 --> 01:20:32.320
<i>I dreamed me and Btoo get safe</i>
<i>and get married,</i>

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:33.255
and I did.

01:20:35.957 --> 01:20:41.463
I have one more dream--me
and Btoo adopt kids.

01:20:43.698 --> 01:20:45.634
<i>Kids really need family,</i>

01:20:45.634 --> 01:20:50.572
<i>and I start dreaming</i>
<i>about building our own home.</i>

01:20:50.572 --> 01:20:52.874
We can do a lot
for the family.
