DAD, CAN YOU HELP
ME WITH MY MATH?

00:36.036 --> 00:38.121
MR. SHACKLEFORD SAYS
IF I DON'T LEARN IT

00:38.205 --> 00:40.499
I WON'T BE ABLE TO FUNCTION
IN THE REAL WORLD.

00:40.582 --> 00:41.708
OKAY, NOW, WHAT
YOU GOT TO DO

00:41.792 --> 00:43.043
IS GO DOWN THE ROAD

00:43.126 --> 00:44.211
PAST THE OLD
JOHNSON PLACE

00:44.294 --> 00:46.088
AND YOU'RE GOING TO FIND
TWO ROADS.

00:46.171 --> 00:48.006
ONE PARALLEL
AND ONE PERPENDICULAR.

00:48.090 --> 00:50.259
NOW, KEEP GOING
UNTIL YOU COME TO A HIGHWAY

00:50.342 --> 00:52.344
THAT BISECTS IT
AT A 45-DEGREE ANGLE.

00:52.427 --> 00:53.428
SOLVE FOR X.

00:56.598 --> 00:57.975
MATH... HUH.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.518
MATH, MY DEAR BOY

00:59.601 --> 01:02.479
IS NOTHING MORE THAN
THE LESBIAN SISTER OF BIOLOGY.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.022
( knocking )

01:05.357 --> 01:06.358
HELLO, SIR.

01:06.441 --> 01:07.442
ENOUGH WITH
THE FOREPLAY.

01:07.526 --> 01:08.527
WHAT ARE YOU SELLING?

01:08.610 --> 01:09.987
WELL, I WAS GOING TO TRY

01:10.070 --> 01:11.613
TO SELL YOU
SOME HANDSOME CREAM

01:11.697 --> 01:12.698
BUT I CAN SEE

01:12.781 --> 01:14.366
YOU ALREADY BOUGHT OUT
THE STORE.

01:14.449 --> 01:16.201
GO ON.

01:16.285 --> 01:18.745
SO, PERHAPS YOU'D BE INTERESTED
IN SOMETHING

01:18.829 --> 01:20.789
EVERY HOMEOWNER
CANNOT BE WITHOUT:

01:20.873 --> 01:21.874
VOLCANO INSURANCE.

01:21.999 --> 01:23.500
GO ON.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.127
ACCORDING TO MY UNCLE

01:25.210 --> 01:27.254
WHO'S A REAL WHIZ WITH VOLCANOES

01:27.337 --> 01:29.381
A VOLCANO IS COMING THIS WAY.

01:29.464 --> 01:33.343
HMM... I, TOO,
HAVE AN UNCLE.

01:33.427 --> 01:34.428
COME IN.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.430
HOW MUCH IS THIS
VOLCANO INSURANCE?

01:36.513 --> 01:37.681
I-I DON'T KNOW.

01:37.764 --> 01:39.141
UH, LET'S SAY $200.

01:39.224 --> 01:40.726
$200? THAT'S MORE
THAN I SPENT

01:40.809 --> 01:42.102
ON ALL THAT
HANDSOME CREAM.

01:42.186 --> 01:43.604
I DON'T HAVE THAT
KIND OF MONEY.

01:43.687 --> 01:44.897
WHAT ABOUT
THAT JAR OF MONEY?

01:44.980 --> 01:46.148
OH, WAIT

01:46.231 --> 01:47.482
THAT'S LOIS'S
RAINY-DAY FUND.

01:47.566 --> 01:48.567
AH, COME ON.

01:48.650 --> 01:50.194
IT NEVER RAINS
IN RHODE ISLAND.

01:50.277 --> 01:51.862
BUT-- YEAH, BUT I'M PRETTY SURE

01:51.945 --> 01:53.447
WE'VE NEVER HAD
A VOLCANO EITHER.

01:53.530 --> 01:56.325
WELL, DON'T YOU THINK
WE'RE OVERDUE FOR ONE?

01:56.408 --> 01:58.869
TOUCHE, SALESMAN.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.914
( Stewie snoring )

02:07.753 --> 02:09.630
OH!
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

02:09.713 --> 02:11.548
WATCHING YOU SLEEP, CUTIE-PIE.

02:11.798 --> 02:14.092
WHY YOU SICK, SICK
LITTLE MOO COW.

02:14.176 --> 02:15.344
YOU SHALL WATCH

02:15.427 --> 02:16.428
NO MORE!

02:16.553 --> 02:17.679
STEWIE!

02:17.763 --> 02:18.805
MY GLASSES!

02:18.889 --> 02:20.766
I CAN'T SEE A THING
WITHOUT MY GLASSES.

02:20.849 --> 02:22.392
WHY WON'T YOU LET ME
GET LASER SURGERY?

02:22.476 --> 02:24.353
BECAUSE I JUST DON'T THINK
IT'S SAFE.

02:24.436 --> 02:26.605
OKAY, I JUST NEED TO MAKE
A QUICK INCISION HERE

02:26.688 --> 02:28.190
AND WE SHOULD BE
ALL DONE, MRS. WILSON.

02:28.273 --> 02:30.025
LUKE, USE THE FORCE.

02:30.108 --> 02:31.652
REALLY? 'CAUSE I
WAS JUST GOING TO...

02:31.735 --> 02:32.736
LUKE, USE THE FORCE.

02:32.819 --> 02:33.946
OKAY.

02:36.532 --> 02:38.700
( screams )

02:38.784 --> 02:39.993
ARE YOU HAPPY?

02:40.077 --> 02:42.079
I'VE NEVER BEEN HAPPY.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.705
OH, DON'T WORRY, HONEY

02:43.789 --> 02:45.290
WE'LL GET YOU
A NEW PAIR TOMORROW.

02:45.374 --> 02:46.416
YES, AND IN
THE MEANTIME

02:46.500 --> 02:47.584
HERE'S A LITTLE
VISION TEST.

02:47.668 --> 02:48.794
WHAT IS THIS?

02:48.877 --> 02:50.337
A POOPIE OR TOBLERONE?

02:53.173 --> 02:54.299
TV Announcer:
We now return

02:54.383 --> 02:56.593
to Girlfriends on Lifetime.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.136
Barry was over last night
and he...

02:58.220 --> 02:59.596
Don't tell me.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.306
Both:
He left the toilet seat up.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.184
Oh, I ran into Frank.

03:04.268 --> 03:06.478
It's funny; he
fought in Vietnam

03:06.562 --> 03:08.021
he's an exorcist

03:08.105 --> 03:10.023
but there is one thing
that terrifies him...

03:10.107 --> 03:12.818
Both:
Commitment.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.987
Oh, Midge, you're
my third best friend

03:15.070 --> 03:16.238
in the whole world.

03:16.321 --> 03:17.948
Third? Who are
the first two?

03:18.031 --> 03:19.199
Ben and Jerry.

03:19.283 --> 03:20.742
( laughing )

03:20.826 --> 03:23.328
Announcer:
Lifetime: Television for Idiots.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.539
PETER, DID YOU
TAKE THE MONEY

03:25.622 --> 03:26.999
FROM THE FAMILY JAR?

03:27.082 --> 03:28.250
WHO ME? YES ME.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.543
COULDN'T BE. THEN WHO?

03:29.710 --> 03:30.711
YEAH, I DID IT.

03:30.794 --> 03:32.713
I BOUGHT US VOLCANO INSURANCE.

03:32.838 --> 03:34.173
VOLCANO INSURANCE.

03:34.256 --> 03:35.674
THAT'S RIDICULOUS!

03:35.757 --> 03:37.342
THAT'S THE SAME THING YOU SAID

03:37.426 --> 03:39.511
WHEN YOU TALKED ME OUT OF
GETTING THAT CLOUD INSURANCE.

03:39.595 --> 03:41.054
LOOK AT THEM UP THERE.

03:41.138 --> 03:43.348
JUST PLOTTING...
PICKING THEIR MOMENT.

03:43.682 --> 03:46.935
SO, BILL,
WE ATTACK TOMORROW.

03:47.019 --> 03:49.521
YES. TOMORROW.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.440
I MEAN IT THIS TIME.

03:51.523 --> 03:52.524
I DO, TOO.

03:52.608 --> 03:54.484
PETER, THAT WAS
OUR EMERGENCY MONEY

03:54.693 --> 03:56.403
AND YOUR DAUGHTER
JUST SO HAPPENS

03:56.486 --> 03:58.030
TO NEED A NEW
PAIR OF GLASSES.

03:58.113 --> 04:00.240
LOIS, NO ONE
REALLY NEEDS GLASSES.

04:00.324 --> 04:01.867
YOU WEAR GLASSES.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.620
THAT'S ONLY TO FOOL THE MAN
FROM THE DRAFT BOARD.

04:04.703 --> 04:07.164
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
SQUANDERED THAT MONEY.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.624
I SWEAR, SOMETIMES I FEEL

04:08.707 --> 04:10.292
LIKE I'M MARRIED
TO A CHILD.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.211
WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT

04:12.294 --> 04:13.629
MY BEAUTIFUL BRIDE

04:13.712 --> 04:15.547
EXCEPT MILK, MILK,
LEMONADE

04:15.631 --> 04:17.758
AROUND THE CORNER,
FUDGE IS MADE.

04:17.841 --> 04:18.967
( goofy laugh )

04:21.094 --> 04:23.222
YOU BETTER WATCH WHO YOU'RE
CALLING A CHILD, LOIS

04:23.305 --> 04:24.306
BECAUSE IF I'M A CHILD

04:24.473 --> 04:25.599
THEN YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT MAKES YOU?

04:25.682 --> 04:28.143
A PEDOPHILE. AND I'LL DAMNED
IF I'M GOING TO STAND HERE

04:28.227 --> 04:29.478
AND BE LECTURED
BY A PERVERT.

04:32.648 --> 04:33.899
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT,
CLEVELAND?

04:33.982 --> 04:35.317
LOIS THINKS
I'M BAD WITH MONEY.

04:35.442 --> 04:36.735
SHE'S GOT A POINT, PETER.

04:36.818 --> 04:38.320
YOU'RE THE WHITE VERSION

04:38.403 --> 04:40.948
OF A BLACK GUY WHO'S NOT GOOD
WITH HIS MONEY.

04:41.031 --> 04:42.491
HEY, GUYS AND DOLLS

04:42.574 --> 04:44.451
DRINKS ARE ON
DO-RE-ME!

04:44.535 --> 04:46.453
WHERE'D YOU GET THAT?

04:46.537 --> 04:48.330
THIS LOOT'S
THANKS TO MY STOCKBROKER

04:48.413 --> 04:50.165
IAN GREENSTEIN.

04:50.249 --> 04:52.709
HE MADE SOME SMART INVESTMENTS
THAT REALLY PAID OFF.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.837
THAT GUY IS TO MONEY
WHAT MISS ANN-MARGRET

04:54.920 --> 04:57.214
IS TO EE-ER-EE-ER...

04:57.297 --> 04:59.675
LET ME BUY THE DRINKS, QUAGMIRE.

04:59.758 --> 05:04.805
MY ACCOUNTANT LARRY ROSENBLATT
JUST GOT ME A HUGE TAX REFUND

05:04.888 --> 05:07.391
AND TICKETS TO
BRING IN DA NOISE, BRING IN DA FUNK.

05:07.474 --> 05:08.642
THE NOISE WAS GOOD

05:08.725 --> 05:10.394
BUT I THOUGHT
THEY PHONED IN

05:10.477 --> 05:11.645
A LOT OF THE FUNK.

05:11.728 --> 05:12.729
WAIT A SECOND.

05:12.855 --> 05:14.147
ROSENBLATT? GREENSTEIN?

05:14.231 --> 05:17.192
SO YOU'RE SAYING I NEED
A JEWISH GUY TO HANDLE MY MONEY.

05:17.276 --> 05:19.570
PETER, NOT EVERY
JEWISH PERSON IS GOOD WITH MONEY.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.697
WELL, YEAH, I GUESS
NOT THE RETARDED ONES

05:21.780 --> 05:23.282
BUT WHY WOULD YOU EVEN SAY THAT?

05:23.365 --> 05:24.867
FOR SHOCK VALUE?

05:24.950 --> 05:27.244
SHESH, CLEVELAND, THERE'S EDGY
AND THERE'S OFFENSIVE.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.537
GOOD DAY, SIR.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.541
MOTHER, YOU KNOW
HOW I HATE

05:32.624 --> 05:34.877
ASKING FOR MONEY,
BUT...

05:34.960 --> 05:37.462
MOTHER, PETER'S AN
EXCELLENT PROVIDER.

05:37.546 --> 05:39.548
NO, MOTHER,
I DO NOT THINK

05:39.631 --> 05:41.675
I'D BE BETTER OFF
MARRIED TO A CHIMP.

05:41.758 --> 05:45.554
I DON'T CARE HOW WELL THAT CHIMP
ACROSS THE STREET IS DOING.

05:45.637 --> 05:48.765
REALLY? WELL, YEAH, OKAY

05:48.849 --> 05:51.727
I GUESS YOU CAN TELL HIM
I SAID HI.

05:51.810 --> 05:53.353
BUT DON'T MAKE ME
SOUND DESPERATE.

05:53.437 --> 05:56.899
I GOT TO GET A GREENSTEIN

THIS CONTRACT

09:43.584 --> 09:45.043

-SO, JUST REFUND THIS MAN'S MONEY

09:55.512 --> 09:56.555
AND WE'LL BE ON OUR WAY.

09:56.638 --> 09:58.056
I DON'T HAVE YOUR MONEY.

09:58.140 --> 09:59.433
HOW ABOUT THAT MONEY?

09:59.516 --> 10:00.851
NO WAY.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.561
THAT'S LOIS'
RAINY DAY FUND.

10:02.644 --> 10:03.770
OH, DAMN IT.

10:05.731 --> 10:06.732
So you couldn't date her

10:06.815 --> 10:07.816
because she was a tickler.

10:07.900 --> 10:08.984
A tickler.

10:09.067 --> 10:10.360
And you're
not a stickler for a tickler.

10:10.444 --> 10:11.695
Not a stickler
for a tickler.

10:11.778 --> 10:14.156
Not a tickler stickler?
Not a tickler stickler.

10:14.239 --> 10:16.033
Tickler, stickler.
Stickler, tickler.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.035
WHERE THE HELL IS THE REMOTE?

10:18.118 --> 10:20.245
HEY, HONEY, GUESS WHAT?

10:20.329 --> 10:21.997
I GOT BACK THE MONEY
FOR MEG'S GLASSES.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.165
REALLY?

10:23.248 --> 10:24.666
OH, HONEY.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.084
OH, HELLO.

10:26.168 --> 10:28.670
THIS IS MY SPECIAL
FRIEND MAX WEINSTEIN.

10:28.754 --> 10:29.755
HE'S JEWISH.

10:29.838 --> 10:31.798
OH, MY, HOW EXOTIC.

10:31.882 --> 10:33.008
THANK YOU?

10:33.091 --> 10:34.968
SEE? HERE'S YOUR
RAINY DAY MONEY

10:35.052 --> 10:36.595
AND I BALANCED
OUR CHECKBOOK, TOO.

10:37.596 --> 10:39.640
YOU BALANCED
OUR CHECKBOOK?

10:39.723 --> 10:40.974
YEP. ISN'T THAT RIGHT, MAX?

10:41.058 --> 10:42.726
HMM? OH, YEAH, SURE.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.311
HE DID IT.

10:44.394 --> 10:47.022
WELL, I'M GOING TO GO CALL
MY MOTHER RIGHT NOW

10:47.105 --> 10:48.899
AND TELL HER TO TELL THAT CHIMP
ACROSS THE STREET.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.235
( monkey-like screeching)

10:52.194 --> 10:54.446
OH, LOOK HOW LOW I'VE SUNK.

10:54.530 --> 10:57.324
TAKING CREDIT FOR SOMETHING
A SMART JEWISH PERSON DID.

10:57.407 --> 10:58.909
-OH, THAT'S OKAY, PETER.
-NO, NO, NO.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.328
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DOING THAT
FOR TOO DAMN LONG.

11:01.411 --> 11:05.332
IT IS THE WHITE DEVIL THAT
HAS PROPOGATED, EXACERBATED,

11:05.415 --> 11:10.295
INSTIGATED... INSTIGATED...
LINE.

11:10.379 --> 11:12.965
INSTIGATED OUR HATRED
LIKE A BUICK.

11:13.048 --> 11:15.300
WHAT WAS I THINKING
WHEN I AGREED TO THIS?

11:15.384 --> 11:17.636
THIS IS SO DEGRADING.
IT'S... THIS IS... WORSE

11:17.719 --> 11:19.805
THAN THE TIME I WAS
AT THE FRIAR'S CLUB

11:19.888 --> 11:22.057
AND SOON-YI'S RETAINER
FELL OUT OF MY PANTS.

11:24.601 --> 11:27.479
LOIS, I APPRECIATE
THE MARSHMALLOW AND FISH CASSEROLE

11:27.563 --> 11:30.774
BUT, I'M SORRY, I...
I CAN'T EAT THIS.

11:30.858 --> 11:33.026
OH, BECAUSE IT'S NOT KOSHER.

11:34.152 --> 11:35.404
YEAH, LET'S GO WITH THAT.

11:35.487 --> 11:37.072
CAN STEWIE AND
ME BE EXCUSED?

11:37.155 --> 11:39.324
HE'S GOING TO HELP ME
WITH MY MATH HOMEWORK.

11:39.408 --> 11:41.201
CHRIS, HE'S JUST A BABY.

11:41.285 --> 11:44.121
OH, AND YOU'RE
A REGULAR RHODES SCHOLAR?

11:44.204 --> 11:46.957
WHERE WAS IT YOU GRADUATED FROM
AGAIN? HMM?

11:47.040 --> 11:48.417
THE UNIVERSITY OF DUH?

11:48.500 --> 11:50.377
I CAN HELP YOU WITH
YOUR HOMEWORK, SON.

11:50.460 --> 11:53.380
OH, MY GOD, IS THERE NOTHING
YOU PEOPLE CAN'T DO?

11:53.463 --> 11:56.008
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
OTHER THAN MANUAL LABOR?

11:56.091 --> 11:58.218
PETER, WHAT A RIDICULOUS
THING TO SAY.

11:58.302 --> 11:59.887
THEY BUILT THE PYRAMIDS.

11:59.970 --> 12:01.638
YOU'LL HAVE TO
EXCUSE PETER.

12:01.722 --> 12:04.057
HE CAN BE A LITTLE
TACTLESS SOMETIMES.

12:04.141 --> 12:06.602
YES, LIKE THE TIME HE SOILED
HIMSELF AT THAT DINNER PARTY?

12:06.685 --> 12:10.189
I WAS SO SORRY TO HEAR THAT
YOUR FATHER PASSED AWAY.

12:10.272 --> 12:12.816
YES, IT SPREAD
THROUGH HIS BODY SO FAST

12:12.900 --> 12:15.319
BUT HE'S AT PEACE NOW,
AND A WHOLE...

12:15.402 --> 12:16.862
UH-OH.

12:16.945 --> 12:18.989
AHH... WELL, THERE'S
ONLY ONE THING

12:19.072 --> 12:21.241
THAT WILL TOP
A GREAT DINNER LIKE THAT.

12:21.325 --> 12:22.659
OPERATION.

12:22.743 --> 12:24.494
-MAY I PLAY?
-MOM?

12:24.578 --> 12:25.954
-MOM?
-MOM?

12:26.038 --> 12:27.581
THANK YOU, BUT I CAN'T STAY.

12:27.664 --> 12:28.707
IT'S FRIDAY NIGHT.

12:28.832 --> 12:30.000
I'VE GOT TO GO TO TEMPLE.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.085
TEMPLE? AH, LIKE INDIANA JONES?

12:46.892 --> 12:49.061
WILL YOU JUST
PICK IT UP ALREADY?

12:51.104 --> 12:52.105
LOOK, THEY'D
BETTER NOT

12:52.189 --> 12:53.565
BE EXPECTING US
TO GIVE MONEY

12:53.649 --> 12:55.400
BECAUSE I ALREADY GAVE
AT CHURCH LAST SUNDAY

12:55.484 --> 12:57.444
AND I'M PRETTY SURE
IT ALL GOES TO THE SAME GOD.

12:57.528 --> 12:59.905
PETER! MAX, IT WAS NICE
OF YOU TO INVITE US ALONG.

12:59.988 --> 13:01.823
YOUR HUSBAND'S GOT
A GOOD HEART, LOIS

13:01.907 --> 13:04.409
BUT HIS VIEWS ON JUDAISM
ARE A LITTLE MISGUIDED.

13:04.493 --> 13:06.411
I'D CONSIDER IT A MITZVAH
TO EDUCATE HIM A LITTLE.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.376
NO, NO, NO. NO.

13:12.459 --> 13:13.752
I DON'T THINK SO.

13:13.836 --> 13:16.088
IT IS NOT THAT I HAVE
IDEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES.

13:16.171 --> 13:17.673
I'M JUST NOT A HAT PERSON.

13:17.756 --> 13:19.049
HEY, LOOK. I DIDN'T KNOW

13:19.132 --> 13:21.051
THE PRINCIPAL
OF MEG'S SCHOOL WAS JEWISH.

13:21.134 --> 13:24.179
HEY, THERE'S BILLY NYE
THE SCIENCE GUY, AND HALF

13:24.263 --> 13:25.347
OF LENNY KRAVITZ.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.224
OPTIMUS PRIME?

13:27.307 --> 13:28.600
HE'S JEWISH?

13:31.979 --> 13:33.397
AW, JEEZ, MAX, I...

13:33.480 --> 13:34.565
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS.

13:34.648 --> 13:35.899
I WENT TO CATHOLIC SCHOOL.

13:35.983 --> 13:37.150
I'M NOT SURE THIS IS ALLOWED.

13:37.234 --> 13:39.111
AW, WHAT THE HELL.

13:40.863 --> 13:42.114
OH, DEAR.

13:42.197 --> 13:43.824
SISTER MARY JOSEPH,
IT APPEARS

13:43.907 --> 13:45.701
PETER GRIFFIN HAS
ENTERED A SYNAGOGUE.

13:45.784 --> 13:47.619
LOCK 'N' LOAD, BRIDES OF CHRIST.

13:54.626 --> 13:55.711
( quacking )

13:55.794 --> 13:57.171
EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT.

13:57.254 --> 13:58.714
( quacking )

14:00.632 --> 14:01.758
HELLO.

14:01.842 --> 14:03.635
OH, WE'RE NOT JEWISH.

14:03.719 --> 14:07.264
BUT I HEAR YOU PEOPLE
HAVE SUCH LOVELY SERVICES.

14:07.347 --> 14:10.809
OH, MY GOD, I DIDN'T MEAN
"YOU PEOPLE."

14:11.602 --> 14:14.396
I DIDN'T MEAN,
"OH, MY GOD" EITHER.

14:14.479 --> 14:16.732
I KNOW HE'S YOUR GOD, TOO.

14:16.815 --> 14:18.817
I... SHH.
SORRY.

14:18.901 --> 14:23.322
AND ON THIS DAY, THE SABBATH
WE GATHER HERE TO...

14:23.405 --> 14:25.157
UH-OH!

14:27.659 --> 14:29.119
THAT WAS SO NICE.

14:29.203 --> 14:30.495
A GOOD SERMON

14:30.579 --> 14:32.623
AND SUCH BEAUTIFUL SONGS.

14:32.706 --> 14:35.167
YEAH, IT WAS JUST LIKE THAT
OTHER JEWISH MUSICAL WE SAW.

14:35.250 --> 14:38.086
( bouncy violin music )

14:38.170 --> 14:39.630
A FIDDLER ON THE ROOF.

14:39.713 --> 14:41.465
SOUNDS CRAZY, NO?

14:41.548 --> 14:45.093
BUT HERE, IN OUR LITTLE VILLAGE
OF ANATEVKA, YOU MIGHT SAY

14:45.177 --> 14:46.345
EACH ONE OF US...

14:46.428 --> 14:49.848
CARD!

14:49.932 --> 14:53.477
CARD!

14:53.560 --> 14:54.603
WELL, THERE'S MY CAB.

14:54.686 --> 14:56.396
IT WAS NICE MEETING ALL OF YOU.

14:56.480 --> 14:57.856
AW, THANKS
FOR EVERYTHING, BUDDY.

14:57.940 --> 14:58.982
WAIT, MR. WEINSTEIN.

14:59.066 --> 15:00.192
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING
TO HELP ME

15:00.275 --> 15:01.610
WITH MY HOMEWORK.

15:01.693 --> 15:03.278
I'M SORRY, SON.
I HAVE TO GO, BUT I'M...

15:03.362 --> 15:04.821
I'M SURE YOU'LL DO JUST FINE.

15:04.905 --> 15:06.073
I DON'T KNOW, MAX.

15:06.156 --> 15:07.449
THE KID'S NOT EXACTLY
AN HONOR-ROLL STUDENT.

15:07.533 --> 15:08.534
WATCH.

15:08.617 --> 15:09.618
HEY.

15:09.701 --> 15:10.702
HE DID IT.

15:10.786 --> 15:11.870
SEE?

15:11.954 --> 15:13.705
PETER, YOU
TOOK ME IN, FED ME DINNER

15:13.789 --> 15:15.082
CAME TO TEMPLE
WITH ME.

15:15.165 --> 15:16.333
YOU'RE A NICE FAMILY.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.168
I HAVE FAITH THAT
CHRIS WILL GROW UP

15:18.252 --> 15:19.378
TO BE A REAL MENSCH.

15:19.461 --> 15:21.755
YOU... OW! OW! DAD! DAD!

15:23.173 --> 15:24.842
LOIS, I JUST
FIGURED OUT

15:24.925 --> 15:28.011
HOW TO MAKE SURE CHRIS
BECOMES A BIG SUCCESS.

15:28.095 --> 15:29.304
PLEASE TELL ME
THIS DOESN'T HAVE

15:29.388 --> 15:30.973
ANYTHING TO DO
WITH TONY ROBBINS.

15:31.056 --> 15:32.516
OH, NO. I LEARNED
MY LESSON.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.101
COULD YOU SIGN
THIS BOOK, PLEASE?

15:34.184 --> 15:36.436
TONY ROBBINS HUNGRY.

15:40.399 --> 15:43.318
NO, LOIS, I'M GOING
TO MAKE CHRIS JEWISH.

15:43.402 --> 15:44.945
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

15:45.028 --> 15:47.447
HE THINKS IF CHRIS IS JEWISH,
HE'LL BECOME SMART.

15:47.531 --> 15:49.408
PETER, YOU CAN'T CONVERT SOMEONE

15:49.491 --> 15:51.785
BECAUSE YOU THINK
IT'LL HELP THEIR GRADES.

15:51.869 --> 15:54.288
NOW, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ANOTHER WORD ABOUT THIS.

16:04.006 --> 16:05.507
WHERE WE GOING?

16:05.591 --> 16:07.885
SON, IT'S TOO LATE FOR ME
AND MEG'S A GIRL

16:07.968 --> 16:10.095
BUT FOR YOU,
THE SKY'S THE LIMIT.

16:10.179 --> 16:11.889
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE
YOU TO THAT SYNAGOGUE

16:11.972 --> 16:12.973
AND TURN YOU JEWISH.

16:13.056 --> 16:14.224
OKAY!

16:16.393 --> 16:18.103
CHRIS, DUCK.

16:21.106 --> 16:23.066
( sighs )

16:26.862 --> 16:29.489
MR. GRIFFIN, I STILL
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

16:29.573 --> 16:33.285
WHY EXACTLY DOES YOUR SON WANT
TO JOIN THE JEWISH FAITH?

16:33.368 --> 16:35.245
I DON'T KNOW.
HE'S BI-CURIOUS.

16:35.329 --> 16:36.997
I APPRECIATE YOUR INTEREST

16:37.080 --> 16:39.166
BUT JUDAISM TAKES
A SERIOUS COMMITMENT.

16:39.249 --> 16:40.292
ELLIOT HERE

16:40.375 --> 16:41.543
HAS SPENT YEARS PREPARING

16:41.627 --> 16:43.045
FOR HIS BAR MITZVAH
THIS SATURDAY.

16:43.128 --> 16:45.047
A BAR MITZVAH.
PERFECT.

16:45.130 --> 16:46.340
HOW MUCH FOR ONE OF THOSE?

16:46.423 --> 16:48.300
YOU CAN'T JUST BUY
A BAR MITZVAH.

16:48.383 --> 16:50.260
IT REQUIRES A LOT OF STUDY.

16:50.344 --> 16:51.678
WELL, CAN'T WE SKIP THAT PART?

16:51.762 --> 16:53.347
I MEAN, COME ON--
IF CHRIS KNEW HOW TO STUDY

16:53.430 --> 16:54.806
HE WOULDN'T NEED
TO BECOME JEWISH

16:54.932 --> 16:55.933
IN THE FIRST PLACE, RIGHT?

16:57.351 --> 16:58.352
RIGHT?

16:59.478 --> 17:00.479
RIGHT?

17:04.691 --> 17:05.859
DON'T WORRY, DAD.

17:05.943 --> 17:07.819
I DON'T NEED A BAR MITZVAH.

17:07.903 --> 17:09.613
I'M OKAY JUST THE WAY I...

17:09.696 --> 17:10.697
OW, OW, OW!

17:10.781 --> 17:12.282
NOW, WE GOT NO TIME TO LOSE.

17:12.366 --> 17:14.493
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME PLACE
IN AMERICA

17:14.576 --> 17:16.995
WHERE YOU CAN TAKE
A SOLEMN SPIRITUAL CEREMONY

17:17.079 --> 17:18.747
THAT BEGINS
A LIFETIME COMMITMENT

17:18.830 --> 17:20.707
AND BLOW THROUGH IT
IN ABOUT 20 MINUTES.

17:36.223 --> 17:37.558
ALL RIGHT, DAD!

17:38.559 --> 17:40.853
SO HOW DO I LOOK
IN MY NEW GLASSES?

17:40.936 --> 17:42.521
HOW SHALL I PUT THIS?

17:42.604 --> 17:45.524
IN AN ATTIC SOMEWHERE, THERE'S A PORTRAIT
OF YOU GETTING PRETTIER.

17:45.607 --> 17:47.317
WOW. SOMEONE NEEDS A NAP.

17:47.401 --> 17:50.195
AFTER LUNCH, IT'S STRAIGHT
TO BED, STEWIE.

17:50.279 --> 17:53.657
( groans ) THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME
MY WIT HAS GONE UNAPPRECIATED.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.909
AND IN THE COMEDY COMPETITION,

17:55.993 --> 17:59.454
STEWIE GRIFFIN RECEIVES
THREE AND A HALF STARS.

17:59.538 --> 18:03.000
CHALLENGER SINBAD
RECEIVES FOUR STARS.

18:03.083 --> 18:06.128
WE HAVE A NEW CHAMPION-- SINBAD!

18:06.211 --> 18:08.922
STEWIE, ANY
PARTING WORDS?

18:09.006 --> 18:12.134
UM, YOU KNOW, I GOT BEAT,
PURE AND SIMPLE.

18:12.217 --> 18:16.221
YOU, YOU ARE A VERY FUNNY MAN.

18:16.305 --> 18:19.725
MEN BE ACTING ALL LIKE ZOMBIES
AT THE MALL.

18:19.808 --> 18:21.852
GOD, AIN'T THAT THE TRUTH?

18:21.935 --> 18:23.812
WHERE'S YOUR FATHER AND CHRIS?

18:23.896 --> 18:25.939
IT'S NOT LIKE THEM
TO BE LATE FOR LUNCH.

18:26.023 --> 18:27.065
I THINK THEY LEFT A NOTE.

18:39.369 --> 18:40.621
( snickering )

18:40.704 --> 18:42.039
BRIAN, WHAT DO YOU
KNOW ABOUT THIS?

18:42.122 --> 18:43.582
NOTHING.

18:43.665 --> 18:45.792
I KNOW WHEN YOU'RE
LYING TO ME, BRIAN.

18:45.876 --> 18:47.294
NO, NO, I SWEAR.

18:47.377 --> 18:49.880
MEG, TAKE STEWIE UPSTAIRS.

18:51.048 --> 18:52.758
WHAT... WHAT ARE YOU,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:52.841 --> 18:54.593
OH, YOU DON'T KNOW THAT, EITHER.

18:56.845 --> 18:58.305
LAST CHANCE, BRIAN.

19:01.433 --> 19:02.434
( silent whistling )

19:02.643 --> 19:03.727
( yelping )

19:03.810 --> 19:05.229
( whining ):
THEY'RE IN VEGAS

19:05.312 --> 19:06.396
GETTING A QUICKIE BAR MITZVAH.

19:06.480 --> 19:07.481
WHAT?!

19:09.483 --> 19:11.401
WELL, HEL-LOIS.

19:11.485 --> 19:13.654
FORGIVE ME
FOR POINTING.

19:13.737 --> 19:15.155
QUICK, I NEED
TO BORROW YOUR CAR.

19:15.239 --> 19:16.573
I'VE GOT A BAR MITZVAH
TO STOP.

19:16.657 --> 19:18.742
NO PROBLEM-- LET
ME GRAB MY KEYS.

19:48.355 --> 19:49.565
( applause and cheering )

19:50.482 --> 19:51.984
AW, CHRIS,
IN A FEW MINUTES

19:52.067 --> 19:54.403
YOU'LL BECOME A SMART,
SUCCESSFUL JEWISH MAN.

19:54.486 --> 19:56.572
I COULD MAKE
A FORESKIN JOKE RIGHT NOW

19:56.822 --> 19:58.240
BUT THIS
IS A SOLEMN OCCASION.

19:58.323 --> 20:00.158
AND BESIDES, THERE'LL
BE PLENTY OF TIME FOR THAT

20:00.242 --> 20:01.827
ON THE RIDE BACK.

20:01.910 --> 20:03.287
AW, I GOT SO MANY
OF 'EM, TOO.

20:03.370 --> 20:05.998
I-I KNOW, I KNOW--
SHH, SHH, SHH! BUT LATER...

20:23.182 --> 20:25.893
( reading in Hebrew )

20:25.976 --> 20:27.644
CHRIS!

20:28.437 --> 20:30.898
CHRIS!

20:31.064 --> 20:33.317
STOP THIS TRAVESTY RIGHT NOW!

20:33.400 --> 20:36.069
SO, BAR MITZVAHS
ARE TRAVESTIES, HUH?

20:36.153 --> 20:39.072
NO, MY SON GETTING
BAR MITZVAHED IS A TRAVESTY.

20:39.156 --> 20:41.575
HE'S DOING IT FOR ALL
THE WRONG REASONS.

20:41.658 --> 20:43.869
WELL, LOOKIE
HERE, HERSCHEL.

20:44.077 --> 20:47.247
WE GOT US ONE OF THEM
SELF-HATING JEWS.

20:47.331 --> 20:48.790
NOTHING I HATE
WORSE THAN A JEW

20:48.874 --> 20:51.335
WHO DOESN'T APPRECIATE
HER OWN RICH HERITAGE.

20:51.418 --> 20:53.128
COME ON, MORDECAI,
LET'S GET HER!

20:53.212 --> 20:55.506
( crowd clamoring )

21:12.105 --> 21:14.024
I'M SORRY, LOIS.

21:14.107 --> 21:16.818
I JUST WANTED OUR SON TO BE
JEWISH SO HE'D BE SMARTER.

21:16.902 --> 21:18.570
THEN MAYBE HIS WIFE
WOULDN'T BE SORRY

21:18.654 --> 21:20.072
SHE DIDN'T MARRY
THE CHIMP NEXT DOOR.

21:20.155 --> 21:21.782
OH, PETER...

21:21.865 --> 21:24.326
JUST BECAUSE STEVEN
MAKES MORE MONEY THAN YOU

21:24.409 --> 21:26.119
DOESN'T MEAN HE'S ANY SMARTER.

21:26.203 --> 21:28.330
AND I THINK
CHRIS WILL DO JUST FINE.

21:28.413 --> 21:29.414
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

21:29.498 --> 21:30.916
BECAUSE I HAVE FAITH
IN HIM

21:30.999 --> 21:33.001
THE WAY I HAVE FAITH
IN YOU.

21:33.085 --> 21:36.505
BESIDES, A PERSON'S RELIGION
IS NO GUARANTEE OF SUCCESS.

21:36.588 --> 21:38.173
I SEE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

21:38.257 --> 21:39.883
THE JEWISH ARE JUST LIKE US.

21:39.967 --> 21:41.301
NO BETTER, NO WORSE.

21:41.426 --> 21:44.805
YEAH, AND AS THEY SAY:
"ZO ZION, MIT GLICK."

21:44.888 --> 21:45.889
WHAT?!

21:45.973 --> 21:47.766
I THINK WHAT HE'S
TRYING TO SAY IS

21:47.891 --> 21:49.476
EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE OKAY.

21:52.604 --> 21:54.648
( slapping and yelping )
