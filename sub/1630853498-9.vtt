WEBVTT

00:26.080 --> 00:27.120
Hey!

00:27.200 --> 00:29.040
Shorehaven sucks!

00:38.600 --> 00:42.000
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

01:02.560 --> 01:05.440
It's like he's made himself
at home with the idiot brigade.

01:05.520 --> 01:06.560
I'm glad they took him.

01:06.640 --> 01:09.080
It's obviously
where he belongs.

01:09.160 --> 01:10.720
Feeling a bit
outnumbered are we?

01:10.800 --> 01:12.520
Just a little bit.

01:12.600 --> 01:14.800
It's a good thing you guys
thrive under tough conditions,

01:14.880 --> 01:16.280
and you both
smashed your heats,

01:16.360 --> 01:17.680
so either of you
could win this.

01:17.760 --> 01:19.960
And if you both stay focused
over the next couple of days,

01:20.040 --> 01:22.360
then the State Team
here we come, let's go--

01:23.760 --> 01:25.560
Sorry, sorry.
Not sorry.

01:25.640 --> 01:27.920
I'm gonna kick that
thing onto the street.

01:29.080 --> 01:31.160
It's going to be a long night.

01:31.240 --> 01:33.640
They've only got so many
brain cells to burn.

01:34.880 --> 01:36.760
They'll tire themselves
out eventually.

01:53.720 --> 01:54.800
What are they doing?

01:58.240 --> 02:00.360
I've got ear plugs
if you want those.

02:05.040 --> 02:06.800
There. I told you.

02:10.160 --> 02:11.640
Right, that's it.

02:21.560 --> 02:22.960
Oi, keep it down!

02:42.440 --> 02:44.680
Oh! Far out.

02:44.760 --> 02:47.280
Poppy, you nearly
made me crap myself.

02:47.360 --> 02:48.440
What are you doing?

02:50.080 --> 02:52.480
Nothing. I'm just
listening to some music.

02:52.560 --> 02:54.960
Is your taste as bad as
the rest of your team?

02:56.520 --> 02:57.840
Aye, oh no don't.

02:59.040 --> 03:03.520
<i>I feed my spirit. I train my</i>
<i>body. I am strong and powerful.</i>

03:04.640 --> 03:06.080
What is this?

03:06.160 --> 03:07.760
Just affirmations.

03:08.280 --> 03:10.560
They help me focus
before comps.

03:10.640 --> 03:14.640
So you listen to some girl
tell you how awesome you are?

03:14.720 --> 03:15.680
That figures.

03:15.760 --> 03:17.440
As if you don't
have your thing.

03:17.520 --> 03:19.160
I see you walking
around before heats,

03:19.240 --> 03:21.280
headphones in,
talking to yourself.

03:21.360 --> 03:22.720
I do not talk to myself.

03:22.800 --> 03:23.800
Don't be embarrassed.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.120
It's cute.

03:29.240 --> 03:32.040
Look, just tell your
mates to keep it down.

03:32.120 --> 03:33.560
Sure thing.

03:33.640 --> 03:34.480
Night Pops.

03:36.200 --> 03:37.920
Always enjoy our chats.

04:59.120 --> 05:00.440
<i>â™ª I'll give it some,</i>
<i>Give it some,</i>

05:17.320 --> 05:18.040
Come on

05:35.000 --> 05:36.400
Yo!

05:36.480 --> 05:37.880
Hold up!

05:39.080 --> 05:41.640
Ahhh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

05:41.720 --> 05:42.400
Change of plans.

05:42.480 --> 05:44.000
No, no, we had a deal.

05:44.080 --> 05:46.920
You were supposed to distract
Dad while I get to the island.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Relax! I put Honey on it.

05:49.080 --> 05:50.320
See what I did there?

05:50.400 --> 05:52.280
Honey can't hold him
off for that long.

05:52.360 --> 05:54.120
Why would you even
want to come?

05:54.200 --> 05:56.320
I don't know,
to annoy my mum.

05:56.400 --> 05:58.400
Couldn't make things
easy for her, could I?

05:58.480 --> 06:00.280
I can't believe
I trusted you with this.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.200
Ever since you got here,

06:01.280 --> 06:03.760
you have done nothing
but mess things up for me.

06:03.840 --> 06:05.040
Tell me how you really feel.

06:05.120 --> 06:06.560
Okay fine!

06:06.640 --> 06:08.000
I feel like you've
ruined my life

06:08.080 --> 06:10.360
and I'm glad that you're
finally leaving.

06:11.640 --> 06:12.920
I'm leaving...

06:14.280 --> 06:15.840
..just not yet.

06:16.560 --> 06:17.760
Yo! What's your name?

06:17.840 --> 06:18.760
Stan.

06:18.840 --> 06:20.240
All right,
well step on it Stan.

06:20.320 --> 06:21.640
We've got a ferry to catch.

06:27.440 --> 06:30.120
It's day two of
the Jarrah Island pro juniors,

06:30.200 --> 06:33.600
starting with the Under 16
Girls quarter finals.

06:33.680 --> 06:35.480
It's not looking great
for Tetanui so far,

06:35.560 --> 06:37.480
she's going after everything,

06:37.560 --> 06:40.240
but wave selection has
been all over the shop.

06:40.320 --> 06:41.880
Why is she going
for that move again?

06:41.960 --> 06:43.600
I told her to play
her percentages.

06:44.720 --> 06:46.640
She's been kind of
distracted all morning.

06:49.280 --> 06:51.520
This is the last
of the State qualifying rounds,

06:51.600 --> 06:52.760
so it's do or die now,

06:52.840 --> 06:56.320
as these groms battle it out
for a spot on the State Team.

07:03.440 --> 07:07.720
Last chance for Tetanui here,
stays in the pocket and--

07:07.800 --> 07:08.840
Oh!

07:08.920 --> 07:10.040
Nails it.

07:10.120 --> 07:11.560
There you have it folks.

07:11.640 --> 07:14.560
Anchor Cove's
Lily Tran takes first,

07:14.640 --> 07:16.400
Tetanui scrapes in a second,

07:16.480 --> 07:19.040
and they'll both
advance to the semi's.

07:19.120 --> 07:20.560
I was worried
there for a second.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.520
Nah, never in doubt.

07:22.600 --> 07:24.200
Flip it up Bodhs!

07:24.280 --> 07:25.800
Oi, what was that about?

07:25.880 --> 07:30.040
I was having fun. Aren't you
all about the joy Manu?

07:30.120 --> 07:31.640
Yeah, I'm about strategic joy.

07:31.720 --> 07:32.440
All right.

07:32.520 --> 07:33.920
You just opened the door
for Tran and Lineker

07:34.000 --> 07:35.800
to steal your spot
on the State Team.

07:35.880 --> 07:39.600
If they do well in their semi's
then it's over for you Pops.

07:39.680 --> 07:40.680
Hello?

07:42.280 --> 07:43.040
Pops?

07:43.120 --> 07:44.800
Not much I can
do about that now.

07:46.720 --> 07:48.200
What?

07:52.960 --> 07:54.640
Oh no!

08:06.560 --> 08:09.720
Yo, are they like
into each other?

08:09.800 --> 08:10.760
Oh no.

08:10.840 --> 08:12.600
He's just messing
with her head.

08:12.680 --> 08:14.000
Really?

08:14.080 --> 08:17.200
Yeah, he's just pretending
to have a thing for her.

08:17.280 --> 08:20.800
We'll tell her tomorrow before
the final, to psych her out.

08:20.880 --> 08:23.080
Whatever it takes. Right?

08:24.480 --> 08:25.720
Hey you two.

08:25.800 --> 08:27.240
Sandwich?

08:27.320 --> 08:30.080
Thanks Marlon's mum.
Amazing.

08:41.800 --> 08:43.880
Wait, wait, wait!
No please!

08:43.960 --> 08:45.040
I need to get on that ferry.

08:45.120 --> 08:46.160
Oh, I'm an idiot.

08:46.240 --> 08:48.680
My whole season ruined because
I didn't book a ferry ticket.

08:48.760 --> 08:51.880
I knew you'd give up at
the first hurdle. Come on.

08:57.440 --> 08:58.680
The ferry will
commence boarding

08:58.760 --> 08:59.720
in ten minutes.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.360
Passengers on foot please wait

09:01.440 --> 09:04.760
until the vehicles are
all boarded, thank you.

09:42.800 --> 09:44.160
Now what?

09:48.160 --> 09:50.560
Ahh, great!

09:56.400 --> 09:58.400
If you've got a better
plan I'm all ears.

10:02.240 --> 10:03.800
It's your dad.

10:04.440 --> 10:06.480
He must've figured
it out already.

10:06.560 --> 10:09.240
Would you relax. I changed
your mum's contact details

10:09.320 --> 10:10.640
on his phone to mine.

10:10.720 --> 10:12.960
So he thinks he's
texting Abbie right now.

10:14.640 --> 10:17.200
-Okay, that's kind of genius.
-Yeah.

10:17.280 --> 10:23.520
"Yeah, the kids are with me,
nearly at the airport."

10:24.480 --> 10:25.480
"See you soon."

10:25.560 --> 10:27.760
Wait wait wait,
three x's and a smiley face.

10:27.840 --> 10:29.840
That's how mum always signs off.

10:31.680 --> 10:34.400
Nice.
Skilling up Gibson.

10:35.600 --> 10:37.920
1, 2, 3.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.600
And sent.

10:40.200 --> 10:43.320
If this works,
it'll be a miracle.

11:00.520 --> 11:02.840
So, Summer just
woke up and decided

11:02.920 --> 11:04.720
to go with Mum to
the airport did she?

11:04.800 --> 11:07.920
Yeah. Yeah!
Classic Summer, so fickle.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.960
And this was after she
gave you a skateboard.

11:11.040 --> 11:13.040
Out of the goodness
of her heart. Yeah.

11:13.120 --> 11:15.960
Hmm hmm. And Ari just
tagged along did he?

11:16.040 --> 11:18.160
For moral support. Correct.

11:25.080 --> 11:26.960
I think I see
what's going on here.

11:31.840 --> 11:33.080
Those two are trying
to worm their way

11:33.160 --> 11:35.200
back into our good books.

11:35.280 --> 11:37.440
See, underneath it all,
they're both pretty good kids.

11:37.520 --> 11:39.840
Yeah. Yeah. They really are.

11:40.520 --> 11:42.080
Yeah.

11:51.760 --> 11:54.000
Sorry sir, we will be
underway shortly.

11:56.360 --> 11:57.720
Attention passengers,

11:57.800 --> 11:59.440
the ferry is now boarding.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.200
I wish I'd left 15 minutes ago.

12:04.280 --> 12:06.800
There is no way I'm
making it to my heat now.

12:06.880 --> 12:10.240
In other news, Bodhi and Poppy
made it to the semi's.

12:10.320 --> 12:12.480
Yeah. Set.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.640
Hey, question.

12:14.720 --> 12:17.240
Suppose you do make it
to the State Team.

12:17.320 --> 12:18.280
What then?

12:18.360 --> 12:20.640
Abbie and Thommo are still
going to lock you in the shed.

12:22.680 --> 12:25.800
If they still don't get
on board, I'll move out.

12:25.880 --> 12:27.440
I'll get a job.

12:29.240 --> 12:30.920
Look, there's this school
I've been looking at

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
on the Gold Coast,
it has a surf academy.

12:34.760 --> 12:38.680
I'm done,
asking for permission.

12:41.720 --> 12:44.400
Wow, what a rebel.

12:48.840 --> 12:51.200
What about you?
What are you doing here?

12:51.280 --> 12:53.520
I told you,
messing with Margot.

12:53.600 --> 12:55.080
Nah.
I don't buy that.

12:56.440 --> 12:58.680
You said you can't wait to
get out of this stinkhole,

12:58.760 --> 12:59.960
away from us yokels,

13:00.040 --> 13:01.480
and then the day
your mum arrives

13:01.560 --> 13:03.400
to take you home,
you do a runner?

13:05.160 --> 13:07.360
The way I talked to you guys,

13:07.440 --> 13:08.480
to the girls,

13:08.560 --> 13:09.480
it wasn't cool.

13:09.560 --> 13:11.280
Okay I can't just
leave it like that.

13:13.400 --> 13:14.600
Wow.

13:15.560 --> 13:17.560
-What a sweetheart.
-Oh shut up.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.600
-Surprise!

13:35.880 --> 13:37.840
Okay, you go, go, go!

13:42.800 --> 13:43.720
Let's go!

13:52.720 --> 13:53.920
"Surprise!"

13:54.000 --> 13:56.440
It just came out.
All right.

13:56.520 --> 13:58.840
Yeah that's it over there,
Jarrah Island.

13:58.920 --> 13:59.800
And when we get off
this thing,

13:59.880 --> 14:01.000
how far to the beach?

14:01.080 --> 14:02.440
About an hour by foot.

14:02.520 --> 14:05.440
Part of your plan is
walking for an hour?

14:05.520 --> 14:06.640
Yeah.

14:08.360 --> 14:09.320
Okay. Okay.

14:09.400 --> 14:11.600
I'll call Poppy and see if she
can get my heat pushed back.

14:11.680 --> 14:12.680
Yeah.

14:13.040 --> 14:14.360
Oi!

14:14.440 --> 14:15.640
-The Prawn!
-Mate, what're you doing here?

14:15.720 --> 14:17.000
Oh, a few mates
are going to go surf

14:17.080 --> 14:19.280
the bombie at Jarrah Rocks.
It should be sweet.

14:19.360 --> 14:22.560
What about you? Your folks
changed their mind last minute?

14:22.640 --> 14:24.600
Yeah. Yeah.
Something like that.

14:25.920 --> 14:27.440
Cutting it a bit short there,
aren't you mate?

14:27.520 --> 14:29.840
Yo Prawnie.
Tell me you've got the van.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.480
Yeah.

14:42.560 --> 14:43.960
Ari's on his
way here right now.

14:44.040 --> 14:46.320
Come on Robo mate, he
just needs another 15 minutes.

14:46.400 --> 14:48.520
Guys,
you know the policy,

14:48.600 --> 14:50.280
and what is it with
Shorehaven surfers

14:50.360 --> 14:53.200
being late for heats.
Get it together.

14:53.280 --> 14:57.080
What if I surf Ari's heat
and he surf's mine?

14:57.160 --> 14:58.960
We're seeded the same anyway.

14:59.040 --> 15:01.960
Hey, well what about your prep?
Are you even warmed up?

15:02.560 --> 15:04.280
Better get out there
quick smart.

15:05.960 --> 15:07.040
All right guys.

15:07.480 --> 15:09.240
Hey, there's a lot of little
ones out there today.

15:09.320 --> 15:11.120
So just put the airs away
and be patient.

15:11.200 --> 15:13.080
Think about the waves
you want to surf.

15:17.120 --> 15:18.200
We made
them wait for it,

15:18.280 --> 15:19.840
but the Under 16 Boys

15:19.920 --> 15:22.600
are finally getting
their chance to shred.

15:22.680 --> 15:24.800
Another measured ride
from Sousa there,

15:24.880 --> 15:28.000
not his usual style,
but I like what I see.

15:28.080 --> 15:29.000
How about that?

15:29.080 --> 15:30.200
He actually listened to me.

15:30.280 --> 15:32.520
And all it took
was changing teams.

15:33.080 --> 15:34.560
Yes Marlon,
another one.

15:40.800 --> 15:42.560
Sousa has
cruised through comfortably,

15:42.640 --> 15:45.480
along with fellow
Anchor Cove rider Ahmed,

15:45.560 --> 15:48.000
and we are cruising
straight into heat three

15:48.080 --> 15:50.280
to see who will be joining him.

15:50.440 --> 15:52.240
Come on Ari, hurry up.

15:57.240 --> 15:58.800
What was that?

15:58.880 --> 16:00.120
That was me killing it.

16:00.200 --> 16:01.000
No.

16:01.080 --> 16:02.720
Why did you swap heats?

16:03.160 --> 16:05.680
Hey, skin of your teeth
brother. Come on.

16:13.360 --> 16:15.400
-Ari!
-Let's go Ari!

16:15.840 --> 16:17.440
And wait
for the right one.

16:17.520 --> 16:18.560
Hey ladies.

16:19.960 --> 16:22.160
Told you she'd tag along.

16:22.400 --> 16:23.680
Be patient!

16:24.000 --> 16:25.160
Come on, you didn't think

16:25.320 --> 16:27.040
you could get rid of me
that easy did you?

16:28.640 --> 16:30.920
We never tried to get
rid of you Summer.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.800
You're the one
who hates being here.

16:32.880 --> 16:35.280
I didn't mean
all that stuff I said.

16:36.120 --> 16:39.040
I was angry and I shouldn't
have taken it out on you guys.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.160
We're trying
to watch Ari's heat.

16:51.600 --> 16:53.560
Come on, Ari!

17:04.840 --> 17:05.920
Well,
these choppy conditions

17:06.000 --> 17:09.480
are proving a bit of a headache
for some of our competitors

17:09.560 --> 17:11.160
but not Ari Gibson.

17:11.240 --> 17:13.840
He just keeps getting
better since he's come back.

17:13.920 --> 17:16.760
And right now he
seems unstoppable.

17:18.240 --> 17:19.880
Look mate we get it,
he's your mate,

17:19.960 --> 17:21.480
you wanted to help him out.

17:21.560 --> 17:22.840
But you're an Anchor now

17:22.920 --> 17:24.880
we need you to have
our backs, not theirs.

17:24.960 --> 17:25.880
Yeah.

17:25.960 --> 17:27.840
-Oh yeah, I do.
-Good.

17:27.920 --> 17:29.960
Because if Ahmed's going
to get the score he needs

17:30.040 --> 17:31.080
to make the State Team,

17:31.160 --> 17:33.360
we need somebody to keep
Gibson out of the way.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.320
-You want me to sit on Ari?
-Yeah.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.000
Put the Club first.

17:38.880 --> 17:40.040
I'm here to win.

17:40.640 --> 17:42.360
Not sabotage my chances.

17:42.440 --> 17:43.680
As long as you come second,

17:43.760 --> 17:45.800
you'll get your shot
in the final.

17:45.880 --> 17:48.480
You told us, that they didn't
respect you at Shorehaven.

17:48.560 --> 17:51.120
We wouldn't ask if we didn't
think you were up to it.

17:57.880 --> 17:59.240
So you with us or not?

18:02.000 --> 18:03.400
Let's do this.

18:03.480 --> 18:04.720
All right.

18:08.040 --> 18:09.440
You got this.

18:15.040 --> 18:16.960
Okay, and in,

18:17.040 --> 18:18.000
two,

18:18.080 --> 18:18.760
three,

18:18.840 --> 18:19.800
four,

18:19.880 --> 18:20.840
and out,

18:20.920 --> 18:22.040
two,

18:22.120 --> 18:23.040
three,

18:23.120 --> 18:24.000
four,

18:24.080 --> 18:24.960
and in,

18:25.040 --> 18:26.200
two,

18:26.280 --> 18:27.560
three, that's good,
keep doing that.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.120
Now remember what we talked
about, hold your bottom turn,

18:30.200 --> 18:33.320
stay in the pocket and
leave it all out there.

18:43.760 --> 18:45.080
We're
just seconds away

18:45.160 --> 18:46.560
from the start
of this semi.

18:46.640 --> 18:49.800
Soon we'll find out who'll make
it to tomorrow's Grand Final.

18:55.120 --> 18:56.840
Good luck man.

19:17.680 --> 19:21.080
Ahmed takes off.
Such a power house.

19:24.280 --> 19:26.800
He's off to a flyer.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.440
Come on Ari,
get around him.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.000
Marlon's not even
catching anything.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.000
He's just blocking Ari.

19:44.080 --> 19:46.560
It's smart.
Puts Ari under the pump.

19:49.800 --> 19:52.000
Can't get a look in,
hey mate.

19:54.040 --> 19:56.640
So you're just gonna give your
new buddy a free ride now ha?

19:58.520 --> 20:00.440
Come on mate!

20:04.680 --> 20:07.520
Gibson finally
slips away from Sousa.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.520
Let's see if he can
make the most of it.

20:17.320 --> 20:18.800
Ari! Yes!

20:18.880 --> 20:20.120
There you go,
there you go Ari!

20:20.200 --> 20:21.720
Pick it up!

20:24.200 --> 20:25.880
[crowd clapping

20:28.920 --> 20:31.160
And
a 6.2 for Gibson.

20:31.240 --> 20:33.000
Finally he's in the game.

20:33.080 --> 20:34.480
Your move bro.

20:43.760 --> 20:45.040
If any of these guys

20:45.120 --> 20:46.200
want to make the State Team,

20:46.280 --> 20:48.920
failure here, is not an option.

20:57.240 --> 20:59.360
What a contest
this has turned into.

21:00.440 --> 21:02.840
Looks like Ahmed's
starting to feel the pressure.

21:02.920 --> 21:05.560
Well the lead's been
changing all heat,

21:05.640 --> 21:07.400
and still anyone's
for the taking.

21:07.480 --> 21:10.720
It could come down
to the last wave.

21:10.800 --> 21:14.640
Gibson drops to third
as the clock ticks down.

21:14.720 --> 21:16.720
Come on Ari.

21:16.800 --> 21:18.960
Last roll
of the dice for Gibson.

21:19.040 --> 21:20.720
Can he hold his nerve?

21:45.360 --> 21:46.560
And he's done it!

21:46.640 --> 21:48.000
Gibson wins!

21:48.080 --> 21:52.200
Sousa through in second place
and Ahmed just missing out.

21:59.960 --> 22:01.760
Yes!

22:17.200 --> 22:18.800
Hey what's wrong
with you Sousa?

22:18.880 --> 22:20.640
Yeah, I didn't feel
like playing dirty.

22:20.720 --> 22:23.000
It's called strategy,
we don't play dirty.

22:23.080 --> 22:24.760
Oh yeah!

22:24.840 --> 22:26.520
Why don't you tell
that to Poppy?

22:26.600 --> 22:28.120
I've got no idea what
you're talking about.

22:29.200 --> 22:32.280
I called it. Massive mistake
taking on a Shorehaven kook.

22:37.640 --> 22:38.680
Oi! Stop!

22:41.640 --> 22:43.880
-Get off him.
-We're telling the judges.

22:43.960 --> 22:45.160
You're done.

22:47.520 --> 22:49.760
Backstabber Marlon.

22:53.600 --> 22:55.560
Oh honey.

22:56.840 --> 22:58.800
Leave it to the
last second bro!

22:58.880 --> 23:01.200
I'm a wreak. On ya mate.

23:11.680 --> 23:14.120
I can't believe you actually
pulled it off Gibson.

23:14.200 --> 23:17.600
I haven't won yet but I wouldn't
have made it without you.

23:18.920 --> 23:20.800
Listen, what I said at the bus,

23:20.880 --> 23:22.680
I, you haven't ruined my life

23:22.760 --> 23:23.880
and I'm not glad
that you're leaving--

23:23.960 --> 23:26.120
Hey Ari, shut up!

23:33.120 --> 23:34.800
I don't want to go either.

23:36.880 --> 23:38.720
Summer!
