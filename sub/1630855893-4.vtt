WEBVTT

00:12.012 --> 00:14.348
It'll be bottom of the fourth inning
by now.

00:14.932 --> 00:17.392
Could've watched the whole game
and been back already.

00:17.392 --> 00:19.645
Maybe there's a radio
around here somewhere.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.439
God forbid we enjoy ourselves.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.775
This whole waiting ordeal is barbaric.

00:26.235 --> 00:27.152
Found the break room.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.489
And there's some very nice candy stripers.

00:30.489 --> 00:32.448
- Good man.
- Here you go.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.745
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:39.373 --> 00:42.084
You'd think the hospital
would invest in some thicker drywall.

01:01.603 --> 01:02.855
Would you like anesthesia?

01:02.855 --> 01:03.814
How much is it?

01:03.814 --> 01:07.693
It depends on how many units we use,
but typically somewhere in the $45 range.

01:08.819 --> 01:11.780
If I knew it would cost that much,
I would've just made it myself.

01:19.329 --> 01:20.956
All right, my dear.

01:25.460 --> 01:27.713
- It's time. Oh, yes.
- No, I can't.

01:27.713 --> 01:29.089
- No.
- Ladies.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.466
- Yes, you can.
- I can't.

01:32.426 --> 01:33.677
I can't.

01:35.929 --> 01:38.682
I found a little extra of the happy stuff.
On the house.

01:48.692 --> 01:49.693
Elizabeth?

01:53.906 --> 01:54.907
Calvin?

01:55.490 --> 01:56.491
Elizabeth.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.119
Calvin?

02:00.120 --> 02:02.915
It's okay. I'm here. Eyes on me.

02:04.625 --> 02:05.709
I'm scared.

02:07.211 --> 02:08.836
We'll do this together. I promise.

02:10.255 --> 02:11.882
I'm so glad that you're here.

02:11.882 --> 02:14.384
I need you. I thought that you left.

02:14.384 --> 02:16.261
No, I'm not going anywhere.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.431
But you did.

02:21.475 --> 02:22.643
I'm right here.

02:24.811 --> 02:25.938
Eyes on me.

02:30.275 --> 02:31.443
All right, here we go.

03:58.655 --> 04:00.532
Your daughter is just fine.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.284
You drugged me.

04:02.284 --> 04:04.703
You're welcome. Do you need to urinate?

04:05.454 --> 04:06.872
No, I do not.

04:06.872 --> 04:07.956
For the next few weeks,

04:07.956 --> 04:10.876
it will likely feel like the fire
of a thousand suns each time you go,

04:10.876 --> 04:12.211
but that will fade.

04:12.211 --> 04:14.379
And then you'll likely notice
some urinary incontinence,

04:14.379 --> 04:16.882
but that usually resolves itself
after a year or so.

04:16.882 --> 04:19.885
Now, why don't I go get your baby girl?

04:19.885 --> 04:22.137
- By the way, what's her name?
- Hadn't thought about it.

04:22.137 --> 04:24.139
I always tell new mothers
not to overthink it.

04:24.139 --> 04:25.599
A name is a name.

04:25.599 --> 04:28.227
Or if you're really stuck,
just go with what you feel right now.

04:28.227 --> 04:30.187
- Mad.
- Lovely.

04:30.187 --> 04:32.064
I have a niece named Maddie.

04:33.232 --> 04:36.026
No. Just "Mad."

04:48.413 --> 04:49.414
Hello.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.337
Isn't she perfect?

04:56.088 --> 04:57.089
Indeed.

04:57.089 --> 05:01.677
Word to the wise, the doctors will
tell you to stay off your feet for a week,

05:02.177 --> 05:03.428
but they've never given birth.

05:03.428 --> 05:06.640
I'd try to stay as long as possible.

05:07.224 --> 05:09.142
My husband is currently camping.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.686
How long have you been here?

05:10.686 --> 05:12.187
Going on two weeks.

05:12.771 --> 05:16.441
Oh, no. No. I can't afford that,
and I need to get back to my work.

05:18.735 --> 05:19.820
Your work?

05:20.320 --> 05:21.572
She's your job now.

05:26.618 --> 05:27.619
Fuck.

05:53.312 --> 05:54.438
Mad.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.234
Who are you going to be?

06:53.789 --> 06:54.623
Please.

06:55.207 --> 06:57.793
Tell me. What is it?

06:58.585 --> 07:00.420
Just tell me.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.923
Please. Do you just not like me?

07:06.301 --> 07:08.804
Come on. Mad.

07:10.305 --> 07:11.306
Please.

07:13.725 --> 07:15.769
Mad, succumb to primitive instinct.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.772
Come on.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.315
Well, nothing's working.

07:20.315 --> 07:23.193
Please, Mad. I'm begging you.
Tell me what you need.

07:26.780 --> 07:30.659
Fine. Cry as much as you want.
Cry until next month for all I care.

07:30.659 --> 07:33.495
- I don't care. Please.
- Hey.

07:48.969 --> 07:49.970
It's okay.

08:30.719 --> 08:34.056
<i>A naval carrier arrived
in San Francisco Bay from Pusan today,</i>

08:34.056 --> 08:37.768
<i>returning over 300 brave heroes
from our shores.</i>

08:37.768 --> 08:41.230
<i>Hundreds of family members
and onlookers lined the docks to cheer</i>

08:41.230 --> 08:43.524
<i>and embrace these brave servicemen</i>

08:43.524 --> 08:46.276
<i>as they return home from
a six-month tour at sea.</i>

08:47.027 --> 08:50.239
<i>One hero comes back to meet
his young son for the first time.</i>

08:50.239 --> 08:52.658
- Look! It's Daddy. I see Daddy.
- <i>While others include wives...</i>

08:52.658 --> 08:54.284
No, baby, that's not Daddy.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.787
Daddy has to stay a little longer
to take care of his patients,

08:56.787 --> 08:58.539
help them get home.

08:58.539 --> 09:03.252
<i>Also seen docking were the two transport
ships carrying hundreds of our brave...</i>

09:03.252 --> 09:06.421
Well, it's almost 8:00 p.m., which means...

09:06.421 --> 09:08.423
- I wanna do it.
- Okay.

09:19.643 --> 09:21.395
One, two...

09:22.771 --> 09:25.440
three, four, five, six,

09:26.233 --> 09:29.486
- seven, eight.
- Ten weeks?

09:29.486 --> 09:31.780
No, eight weeks until Daddy's home.

09:32.656 --> 09:35.200
- How many days is that, Mommy?
- Too many.

10:31.465 --> 10:35.219
It's okay. Okay.

10:36.053 --> 10:38.680
We're okay. Okay.

10:39.806 --> 10:42.392
All right.

10:43.894 --> 10:46.813
Are you hungry? Is that the problem?

10:46.813 --> 10:50.067
Junior! Let's go inside, thank you.

10:51.151 --> 10:54.363
Gonna get you. I'm gonna get you.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.199
All right.

10:59.576 --> 11:01.537
What is the number one rule
of all outdoor games?

11:01.537 --> 11:04.248
Do not track mud into the house.

11:04.248 --> 11:05.415
Right.

11:05.415 --> 11:07.125
Linda, we're having dinner!

11:17.678 --> 11:19.054
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:19.054 --> 11:20.138
She won't eat.

11:20.138 --> 11:22.057
My doctor suggested formula

11:22.057 --> 11:24.309
but there's a study out of Columbia
that suggests that

11:24.309 --> 11:27.187
breast milk is the singular conduit
for antibodies from mother to infant.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.857
Not to mention that
breastfeeding releases oxytocin,

11:29.857 --> 11:32.693
but I don't think that oxytocin is
gonna help us when she dies of starvation.

11:32.693 --> 11:35.112
And I have so much to do,
and I can't do a to-do list

11:35.112 --> 11:36.572
because then it's one more thing to do.

11:37.489 --> 11:40.784
Okay. I'm exhausted just listening to you.

11:40.784 --> 11:41.869
Come on.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.455
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

11:45.455 --> 11:47.165
- It's fine.
- I'm not myself. I can leave.

11:47.165 --> 11:50.210
I am making tea in the kitchen anyway.
Does anybody need anything?

11:50.210 --> 11:51.545
- No, thanks.
- No, I'm fine.

12:00.012 --> 12:02.181
I can go. I'm fine.

12:02.181 --> 12:03.473
Yeah, you seem great.

12:04.600 --> 12:08.312
I've tried to get her on a schedule.
I've been meticulous about timing.

12:08.312 --> 12:11.315
I've been monitoring every cry,
every bowel movement.

12:11.315 --> 12:15.235
I've been trying various positions
and angles, light levels--

12:16.403 --> 12:18.280
What at all is funny about this?

12:21.241 --> 12:24.703
You are so much like him.
So incredibly smart and so, so stupid.

12:24.703 --> 12:25.996
Excuse me?

12:25.996 --> 12:27.414
She's a baby.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.417
She's not a controlled science experiment.

12:30.417 --> 12:34.171
No, I just don't think that
you understand. I didn't want this.

12:34.171 --> 12:38.008
And now I don't think I'm feeling
the way that I'm supposed to be feeling.

12:38.509 --> 12:42.763
You mean that the way
her smile cures your swollen abdomen

12:42.763 --> 12:45.098
and the excruciating pain in your nipples,

12:45.098 --> 12:47.643
because you weren't even
a whole person until you met her, right?

12:48.519 --> 12:50.479
- Yeah, that.
- Yeah, that's bullshit.

12:51.563 --> 12:52.564
Complete fiction.

12:52.564 --> 12:56.360
No. Moms love their children.
It's in their biology.

12:56.360 --> 13:00.614
It's just, my biology is making me have
terrible thoughts in my head.

13:01.198 --> 13:02.282
What kind of thoughts?

13:05.911 --> 13:06.912
You can say it.

13:10.207 --> 13:12.334
Like, what if I just gave her away?

13:16.004 --> 13:16.839
Hey, Agnes.

13:17.631 --> 13:21.218
How many times did you think about
giving Bailey up when he was brand new?

13:21.927 --> 13:25.764
- Why? Is somebody offering?
- Purely for research purposes.

13:25.764 --> 13:29.101
The answer is twice. A day.

13:31.770 --> 13:35.023
My breaking point with Linda? Day six.

13:36.608 --> 13:40.320
So, you're saying at some point
Mad and I will have a relationship

13:40.320 --> 13:42.447
built on mutual love and respect?

13:42.447 --> 13:45.492
Mad? As in Madeline?
Is that a family name?

13:46.660 --> 13:49.371
No. The nurse just told me
to name her what I felt.

13:52.291 --> 13:53.500
You're kidding.

13:55.210 --> 13:57.754
I should have named
my kids Scared and Exhausted.

14:02.426 --> 14:05.387
I will say,
it's very nice to talk to another adult

14:05.387 --> 14:08.557
instead of
just hearing bloodcurdling screams.

14:12.144 --> 14:14.146
Let me take a look at this baby.

14:14.146 --> 14:17.566
Okay.

14:20.152 --> 14:23.488
Hello, Mad.
You're so good, aren't you? Yes, you are.

14:24.198 --> 14:26.909
You'd be surprised how much you can learn
about a baby at this stage.

14:26.909 --> 14:30.204
They're constantly revealing their
future selves in the smallest of ways.

14:30.204 --> 14:32.664
And this one, she can read a room.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.625
Yes, you can.

14:40.422 --> 14:41.590
That's our girl.

14:43.258 --> 14:44.343
Good work.

14:46.595 --> 14:50.849
Who can tell me what a family tree is?

14:53.060 --> 14:58.148
A family tree is a way to learn
where you came from.

14:58.148 --> 14:59.858
Duane, hands to yourself, please.

15:02.444 --> 15:08.867
Your mommy goes in here,
and your daddy goes in here.

15:09.576 --> 15:12.204
Your parents can help you do this.

15:13.705 --> 15:16.166
They'll have all the answers.

16:24.610 --> 16:26.403
- No.
- No?

16:26.403 --> 16:27.321
No.

16:28.322 --> 16:31.950
You can't take out a second mortgage
if you don't have a job to pay it off.

16:31.950 --> 16:34.995
Yes, well, I need to get back
to my research. Once I publish--

16:34.995 --> 16:36.538
Nope, no.

16:36.538 --> 16:39.791
That is theoretical. We're a bank.
We deal in certainty.

16:39.791 --> 16:43.795
You should be grateful your husband
put you on the deed before he died.

16:44.630 --> 16:48.008
That is quite the feat, using "grateful"
and "died" in the same sentence.

16:48.967 --> 16:50.886
As soon as your child is old enough,
get her in school.

16:50.886 --> 16:53.222
Then find a job that actually pays,

16:53.222 --> 16:54.640
or marry rich.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.101
I could certainly rob a bank.

16:58.936 --> 17:01.730
Please schedule a time
with our security guard on your way out.

17:05.108 --> 17:07.027
I have come up
with an appropriate hourly rate

17:07.027 --> 17:10.280
based on your yearly salary with markup,
because you will be submitting this work

17:10.280 --> 17:12.241
as if you're the only person
that touched it.

17:12.241 --> 17:15.035
And what will that hourly rate be?

17:15.035 --> 17:16.203
Eight dollars.

17:16.203 --> 17:19.039
An hour? You're joking.

17:19.915 --> 17:22.041
I agree. You're paid shockingly well.

17:26.255 --> 17:27.256
Fine.

17:30.968 --> 17:33.262
What's the issue with my experiment?

17:33.262 --> 17:34.638
You have two problems.

17:34.638 --> 17:38.851
One, the temperature is too high on this.
You need to lower it by 15 degrees.

17:39.434 --> 17:40.561
Okay. And the other?

17:41.603 --> 17:42.604
Unsolvable.

17:47.317 --> 17:49.069
Please don't tell
the other chemists I was here.

17:49.069 --> 17:50.404
Of course not.

17:50.404 --> 17:51.488
See ya.

17:53.657 --> 17:55.659
- There's a baby.
- I'm sorry.

17:59.246 --> 18:00.622
Don't touch that.

18:16.180 --> 18:17.181
Hey.

18:18.891 --> 18:20.392
Eight dollars, please.

18:20.392 --> 18:23.187
- This stays between us, right?
- Naturally.

18:23.896 --> 18:27.274
Good-- Okay.

18:27.816 --> 18:31.486
<i>Got my bag
And got my reservation</i>

18:32.029 --> 18:35.199
<i>Spent each penny I could afford</i>

18:36.200 --> 18:39.620
<i>Like a child in wild anticipation</i>

18:39.620 --> 18:43.540
<i>I'd like to hear that "All aboard!"</i>

18:58.931 --> 18:59.932
Thanks again.

18:59.932 --> 19:02.309
It's always nice to get
a second pair of eyes.

19:02.309 --> 19:03.727
Just in case, you know.

19:05.938 --> 19:09.149
This was all my wife wanted
when she got back from the hospital.

19:11.193 --> 19:13.862
I'm surprised I haven't seen Boryweitz.
I figured he'd be first in line.

19:13.862 --> 19:16.240
Oh, no. They transferred him to DNA.

19:17.115 --> 19:18.116
DNA?

19:18.825 --> 19:22.454
Yep. He and Donatti are holed up
in there in--

19:24.081 --> 19:27.125
in Evans's old lab actually.

19:48.188 --> 19:49.565
Elizabeth?

19:49.565 --> 19:51.149
Miss Zott.

19:51.149 --> 19:54.945
And this must be Madeline.
How precious is she?

19:56.905 --> 19:58.323
You've stolen our work.

19:58.323 --> 20:00.325
Elizabeth, we can explain.

20:00.868 --> 20:03.036
What exactly are we being accused of here?

20:04.580 --> 20:08.250
You have protocol that I wrote
taped on this wall.

20:08.250 --> 20:10.794
You are referencing our lab notebooks,
our paper.

20:11.545 --> 20:14.047
Did you think I wouldn't recognize
my own work?

20:14.047 --> 20:15.966
Congratulations, Miss Zott.

20:17.384 --> 20:18.969
We received the Remsen.

20:20.470 --> 20:25.100
We even-- We put your name here
in the acknowledgments.

20:27.269 --> 20:31.190
You do not know what any of this means.
You do not know the implications

20:31.190 --> 20:34.902
or what it means for the field
or our understanding of the world.

20:34.902 --> 20:36.820
So, I will be furthering our research.

20:36.820 --> 20:38.363
Our research!

20:38.947 --> 20:42.784
And I will make it greater, and
I will do it faster and more successfully,

20:42.784 --> 20:46.163
because I am a scientist,
and you are a thief!

20:49.124 --> 20:50.209
And you are a fraud.

20:57.174 --> 20:58.759
We take nothing from no one.

21:05.891 --> 21:08.227
Why are you wearing boy shoes?

21:08.227 --> 21:09.645
They're just shoes.

21:09.645 --> 21:12.064
Then why are they the same color
as Jimmy's?

21:13.357 --> 21:15.567
I'm gonna tell Jimmy
you have the same shoes.

21:16.652 --> 21:19.071
- I have girl shoes. At home.
- Jimmy!

22:08.829 --> 22:11.540
Elizabeth. I swear to God.

22:12.207 --> 22:14.751
I've been the handyman in my house
for over three years now.

22:14.751 --> 22:18.839
It was either learn on the job or have to
ask for help anytime the toilet leaked.

22:19.798 --> 22:20.841
Thank you.

22:20.841 --> 22:23.510
Yeah, I'm just trying to keep the peace
in the neighborhood.

22:23.510 --> 22:27.890
All right, let there be... light.

22:29.141 --> 22:31.143
All right, there we are.

22:33.270 --> 22:35.272
Now for the best part
of home improvements.

22:35.272 --> 22:37.232
What have you got to drink around here?

22:37.816 --> 22:41.069
I have five synthetic blends of formula.

22:42.237 --> 22:43.238
And this.

22:45.073 --> 22:46.074
Perfect.

22:51.872 --> 22:53.248
That I can't teach you.

23:04.009 --> 23:05.052
Wait.

23:06.386 --> 23:07.804
It's been six hours.

23:08.472 --> 23:11.141
That is by far the longest
that Mad has slept uninterrupted.

23:11.141 --> 23:13.352
While I'm doing construction, of course.

23:13.352 --> 23:14.686
Mom's getting the hang of it.

23:22.611 --> 23:25.572
Can I ask you
a potentially invasive question?

23:26.782 --> 23:27.908
We'll find out.

23:29.868 --> 23:33.163
I've been thinking about
our conversation the other day.

23:36.458 --> 23:38.836
Did you not plan to get pregnant?

23:45.133 --> 23:47.427
I was finishing law school
when I found out.

23:47.970 --> 23:51.640
And Charlie was starting his residency,
so I waited.

23:52.516 --> 23:56.061
And then Junior came along,
and I waited again.

23:56.061 --> 23:58.146
And then Charlie got deployed and--

23:58.146 --> 23:59.565
You see the pattern.

24:02.317 --> 24:03.443
Do you regret it?

24:09.908 --> 24:13.537
If I could go back
knowing what I know now,

24:15.122 --> 24:16.456
I'd change some things.

24:17.749 --> 24:20.669
But I do know
that the woman sitting here today,

24:20.669 --> 24:23.672
who raised two kids mostly on her own,

24:25.007 --> 24:26.800
is far more resilient for it.

24:29.219 --> 24:31.221
There's been a lot of pain

24:32.222 --> 24:36.059
but what I didn't see coming was
that my capacity to experience joy

24:36.059 --> 24:37.311
would grow along with it.

24:40.564 --> 24:41.565
No.

24:42.107 --> 24:45.986
I don't regret having my kids.
But I do have regrets.

24:46.570 --> 24:48.614
I'm mostly too tired to think about it.

24:52.117 --> 24:56.622
I know you said
it's normal to feel doubt and guilt,

24:58.248 --> 25:01.126
but I'm still not having
those magical moments.

25:02.503 --> 25:03.504
They'll come.

25:09.843 --> 25:13.430
Not that this is my area of expertise but,

25:14.431 --> 25:19.102
well, say you do get this
crazy pseudo-lab kitchen up and running

25:19.102 --> 25:21.897
without exploding the whole neighborhood.
Then what?

25:24.024 --> 25:28.529
Well, Calvin and I did not get
the grant that we were chasing,

25:28.529 --> 25:31.365
so my plan is to finish our research.

25:32.366 --> 25:36.870
And if I can publish on my own,
I can get into any lab I want.

25:37.746 --> 25:38.747
Right.

25:41.291 --> 25:46.505
But don't you need chemicals
and equipment for chemical experiments?

25:50.217 --> 25:54.304
"Hi. It's Fran Frask."

25:55.013 --> 25:56.014
No.

25:56.014 --> 25:58.058
"Hey, toots."

25:58.851 --> 25:59.852
Not that.

26:00.477 --> 26:03.689
"Hi. Hi."

26:11.071 --> 26:13.991
Hi there. It's Fran Frask from Hastings.

26:14.992 --> 26:17.411
Yeah. So, I am calling because I--

26:17.411 --> 26:20.497
I wanted to place an irregular order
for our new satellite lab.

26:21.373 --> 26:24.793
It'll-- It-- Yep. Laboratory vacuum?

26:25.919 --> 26:27.004
We need another one.

26:27.713 --> 26:32.384
<i>Bunsen burners,
graduated cylinders, beakers...</i>

26:35.095 --> 26:38.557
- So, what's this lab do?
- I am not at liberty to say.

27:06.627 --> 27:09.421
To protect mucosal membranes
from noxious fumes?

27:10.005 --> 27:11.006
Precisely.

27:16.845 --> 27:17.846
Here you go.

27:28.857 --> 27:29.942
Hey.

27:31.026 --> 27:32.027
Hey.

27:47.376 --> 27:49.086
I never told you about my brother.

27:51.380 --> 27:52.631
You told me a little bit.

27:56.218 --> 27:58.428
I knew him better
than anybody in the world.

27:59.763 --> 28:03.642
It was almost like
there was an imprint of him on me.

28:05.352 --> 28:08.397
I could feel him so clearly
in every interaction,

28:08.397 --> 28:10.023
in every room that I entered.

28:12.401 --> 28:15.112
I know exactly what he would say
if he was here right now.

28:17.865 --> 28:19.241
But I can't do that with you

28:19.241 --> 28:23.704
because there's so much more
that I don't know than I do know.

28:26.582 --> 28:27.958
What do you wanna know?

28:29.710 --> 28:31.670
I didn't have anyone either.

28:32.963 --> 28:34.173
I wanna know everything.

28:36.175 --> 28:38.260
I wanna know what you were like as a boy.

28:39.511 --> 28:41.763
I wanna know
what kind of father you would be.

28:44.391 --> 28:47.895
I know I didn't tell you,
but you know that I loved you, right?

29:28.477 --> 29:30.562
What are you doing,
showing up here like this?

29:31.313 --> 29:33.649
Your plane doesn't land
for another two nights.

29:33.649 --> 29:37.736
A seat opened up on a C-124
out of Landstuhl, and I snagged it.

29:37.736 --> 29:39.780
I don't know what any of that means.

29:39.780 --> 29:40.864
Daddy!

29:42.074 --> 29:43.867
My baby girl.

29:50.207 --> 29:52.167
How tall are you? 6'?

29:52.167 --> 29:53.836
I'm 48".

29:59.216 --> 30:02.845
Hey there, bubba. It's okay.

30:09.560 --> 30:13.063
You know, your mom told me how brave
you've been since I've been gone.

30:16.066 --> 30:19.611
I thought you might like this.

30:24.366 --> 30:26.159
Do you wanna give your daddy a hug?

30:32.165 --> 30:36.211
Maybe after some ice cream?

30:36.795 --> 30:39.590
- Ice cream.
- There it is.

30:40.048 --> 30:42.259
I've dreamt about this hug.

30:50.142 --> 30:51.810
You can just put it right in the kitchen.

30:56.064 --> 30:58.859
- Ray, you better play this one first.
- Okay. All right.

30:59.484 --> 31:00.611
You look like trouble.

31:04.448 --> 31:05.449
Hello.

31:07.367 --> 31:10.037
- You tried Agnes's corn bread?
- She made sure of it.

31:10.037 --> 31:12.497
- Hey. Hello.
- Hey.

31:12.497 --> 31:14.208
Get over here.

31:16.502 --> 31:19.004
Charlie, this is Elizabeth Zott.

31:19.588 --> 31:21.590
I'm so sorry for your loss.

31:23.467 --> 31:25.427
Is that molasses on the ribs?

31:25.427 --> 31:26.970
That's impressive.

31:26.970 --> 31:29.515
It's Kansas City style,
the way my dad used to make it.

31:30.224 --> 31:32.684
- What do we have here?
- Blackberry pie.

31:32.684 --> 31:36.313
How good we talking?
I won't be shown up in my own home.

31:36.313 --> 31:37.940
Then you might not wanna serve it.

31:39.191 --> 31:40.359
Come on.

31:41.652 --> 31:44.363
Jodie, Rhoda, Agnes.
You remember Elizabeth?

31:44.363 --> 31:45.948
- How you doing?
- Hi.

31:45.948 --> 31:48.659
Hi. It is really nice to see you at a time

31:48.659 --> 31:50.702
when norepinephrine
isn't coursing through my body,

31:50.702 --> 31:53.372
triggered by
an acute flight-or-fight response.

31:54.081 --> 31:56.750
I don't know the science,
but I do remember the feeling.

31:57.709 --> 31:59.419
We're dancing now.

31:59.419 --> 32:00.504
Hey.

32:01.338 --> 32:02.339
- Yes.
- All right.

32:08.595 --> 32:09.596
Come on.

32:13.308 --> 32:14.434
That's right.

32:28.699 --> 32:30.492
Hello there, little one.

32:32.494 --> 32:35.289
Harriet mentioned
this unbelievable blackberry pie.

32:36.248 --> 32:37.249
I'm Curtis Wakely.

32:37.249 --> 32:40.377
Elizabeth Zott.
How do you know the Sloanes?

32:40.377 --> 32:41.712
I just met them.

32:41.712 --> 32:44.464
I'm taking over for my father
as reverend at First Baptist.

32:44.464 --> 32:46.675
If you ever need a reverend
or a taste tester,

32:46.675 --> 32:48.135
I'd be more than happy to oblige.

32:49.511 --> 32:51.555
Well, you're happy to taste test anytime.

32:52.806 --> 32:53.807
Not so much for church?

32:54.766 --> 32:58.228
My father was a preacher, so I have
a complicated relationship with faith.

32:58.228 --> 33:01.273
Plus, I'm a scientist, so I have
a complicated relationship with faith.

33:01.273 --> 33:02.691
I welcome the debate.

33:02.691 --> 33:04.276
There's just not much of a debate

33:04.276 --> 33:06.987
when one side has proof
and the other has guilt.

33:28.550 --> 33:31.512
- I'm so-- It was lovely to meet you.
- You as well.

33:38.143 --> 33:39.645
What you guys got there?

33:39.645 --> 33:41.313
It's a spinning top.

33:42.105 --> 33:44.775
Spinning top? Do you see that?

33:58.497 --> 34:01.667
I miss seeing you at that sink,
Chief Surgeon Sloane.

34:11.677 --> 34:12.678
Baby.

34:17.766 --> 34:19.518
Was today too much too soon?

34:22.353 --> 34:23.563
Yes, probably.

34:25.565 --> 34:28.902
But it was also great
to see everyone again.

34:28.902 --> 34:31.780
Yeah.
I saw you and Sanford in cahoots again.

34:31.780 --> 34:33.072
How's he doing?

34:33.657 --> 34:34.699
He's good.

34:34.699 --> 34:36.451
He's still at Kaiser Sunset.

34:37.744 --> 34:41.790
Said they're looking for
a new chief resident in General Surgery.

34:42.791 --> 34:44.333
You haven't even been back a week.

34:44.918 --> 34:48.297
The money is good, Harr.
It's really, really good.

34:48.297 --> 34:49.882
Yeah? How about the hours?

34:49.882 --> 34:51.382
The hours will be the hours.

34:52.384 --> 34:54.469
- This is a huge opportunity.
- For you.

34:59.683 --> 35:02.936
I feel like I've been putting myself
on hold for a long time now.

35:03.937 --> 35:05.189
What does that mean?

35:06.398 --> 35:08.734
I signed up to take the bar exam
in the spring.

35:09.276 --> 35:12.196
Eugene offered me a position
as junior associate if I pass.

35:13.155 --> 35:15.240
- When were you gonna tell me?
- Now.

35:15.991 --> 35:17.451
- And--
- There's an "and"?

35:17.451 --> 35:20.537
And I've been asked to chair
the Adams Washington Committee

35:20.537 --> 35:23.457
to keep this neighborhood
from turning into a freeway on-ramp.

35:25.501 --> 35:28.587
Did I become Mr. Harriet Sloane
when I was gone?

35:30.297 --> 35:32.090
It's a lot to carry for the both of us.

35:32.090 --> 35:33.342
We'll make it work.

35:35.010 --> 35:38.805
And how in the world are we gonna do that?
Our kids need us both.

35:41.391 --> 35:42.392
I'm not worried.

35:44.603 --> 35:47.606
Yeah? Why not?

35:48.774 --> 35:51.568
Because it's you and me.

36:22.182 --> 36:23.892
- Dr. Mason?
- Miss Zott, how are things?

36:23.892 --> 36:25.227
Good.

36:25.227 --> 36:28.522
Not to make this about me, but I had
the most god-awful row this morning.

36:29.815 --> 36:30.816
Wow.

36:30.816 --> 36:32.401
It's messy, I know.

36:33.110 --> 36:35.404
Haven't heard from you in a while
and thought I'd check in.

36:37.656 --> 36:39.324
You look tired.

36:40.284 --> 36:42.160
What about help? You have someone?

36:43.203 --> 36:44.288
My neighbor drops by.

36:44.788 --> 36:47.499
Excellent. Proximity is critical.

36:48.584 --> 36:51.670
And you're taking care of yourself?
Erging?

36:52.546 --> 36:54.047
When I can find the time.

36:56.091 --> 36:58.844
I know I said a year,
but our two-seat fractured his leg,

36:58.844 --> 37:02.431
so I need you as soon as possible.
Next week at the latest.

37:03.724 --> 37:07.144
- What? No. I'm--
- Tired? Busy?

37:07.144 --> 37:09.354
Probably going to argue
you don't have time.

37:10.230 --> 37:12.274
- Because I don't.
- Who does?

37:14.193 --> 37:16.403
Being an adult is overrated,
don't you think?

37:16.945 --> 37:18.906
Just as you solve one problem,
ten more pull up.

37:21.241 --> 37:24.870
But a chilly splash of water to the face
off starboard, just before dawn?

37:26.038 --> 37:27.247
It fixes things.

37:30.501 --> 37:32.336
Well, off to the hospital.

37:35.797 --> 37:37.341
I'll see you next week, two-seat.

37:46.266 --> 37:47.267
I love you.

37:51.146 --> 37:52.272
I know.

38:18.590 --> 38:20.217
I was just thinking about your dad.

38:22.052 --> 38:24.471
He used to say
that jazz taught him how to think.

38:25.848 --> 38:30.435
How to sit and let the ideas carry him
where they may.

38:31.144 --> 38:32.980
He had a lot of notions.

38:32.980 --> 38:34.273
And dance moves.

38:41.822 --> 38:43.824
Wait, do you think that's funny?

38:58.088 --> 38:59.173
Sloane residence.

38:59.173 --> 39:00.674
Listen to this.

39:05.429 --> 39:06.555
Come on, Mad.

39:07.639 --> 39:09.725
What exactly am I supposed to be hearing?

39:11.476 --> 39:13.770
She was just laughing.

39:13.770 --> 39:16.523
Is that even normal for a child her age?

39:17.441 --> 39:20.652
I think she might be
quite advanced, unsurprisingly.

39:21.945 --> 39:24.698
I just hope she gets her parents'
characteristic humility.

39:38.754 --> 39:39.755
What's wrong?

39:41.590 --> 39:43.675
I can't make my family tree.

39:48.138 --> 39:50.891
It's okay. I can't do mine either.

40:07.324 --> 40:08.325
Hi.

40:11.286 --> 40:12.704
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hey, honey.

40:16.750 --> 40:18.168
Hi, Mom.

40:18.168 --> 40:19.253
Hey, Six Thirty.

40:19.837 --> 40:21.672
So, tell me, how was school?

40:22.339 --> 40:24.925
I don't think Mrs. Mudford likes me.

40:24.925 --> 40:26.593
Highly improbable.

40:26.593 --> 40:30.597
Every time I ask a question,
her mouth goes like this.

40:32.516 --> 40:34.601
That is a scowl. Or a grimace.

40:34.601 --> 40:38.647
What's the difference
between a scowl and a grimace?

40:38.647 --> 40:40.232
There isn't. They're synonyms.

40:40.774 --> 40:41.775
I see.

40:44.278 --> 40:45.779
Did you like your lunch today?

40:46.655 --> 40:49.157
Yes. It was very delicious.

40:50.450 --> 40:52.828
Did you like the pumpkin muffins I made?
I tried a new recipe.

40:53.412 --> 40:54.580
I loved them.

40:56.540 --> 40:57.583
Madeline Zott,

40:57.583 --> 41:00.752
I did not make pumpkin muffins.
I made peanut butter brownies.

41:00.752 --> 41:04.131
You are not eating your lunch,
and worse, you are lying to me.

41:04.131 --> 41:06.466
So, we will not be leaving this spot
until you tell me why.

41:09.887 --> 41:12.347
Now, when I was a girl,

41:12.848 --> 41:19.479
the war made it impossible
for my mother to find stockings.

41:20.522 --> 41:24.610
So, she would knit stockings herself,

41:25.903 --> 41:29.031
but without the waistband.

41:30.324 --> 41:36.246
So, they were just... socks.

41:36.246 --> 41:37.873
Which is to say...

41:38.373 --> 41:41.335
Our numbers are more flaccid than my dick.

41:42.461 --> 41:45.756
Older women love her.
They find her comforting.

41:46.256 --> 41:48.592
No, Walter, they find her boring.

41:49.551 --> 41:52.137
And besides, we need men to watch,

41:52.638 --> 41:57.893
because men have money
to buy things from our sponsors,

41:57.893 --> 42:01.563
so I have money to buy things.

42:01.563 --> 42:06.693
This is Gerta's last day and possibly
her last breaths on this earth.

42:07.945 --> 42:10.822
Phil, at least let her do a goodbye show.

42:10.822 --> 42:13.283
The crone is out. Fill the slot.

42:15.077 --> 42:18.163
Someone young but elegant.

42:18.163 --> 42:21.625
Someone maternal but fuckable.

42:23.168 --> 42:24.670
Maternal and fuckable. Got it.

42:46.608 --> 42:50.028
- Ma'am, I am here to see Walter Pine.
- He's not available.

42:51.613 --> 42:52.531
Mr. Pine.

42:53.615 --> 42:55.701
Nurse auditions are downstairs
to your left.

42:55.701 --> 42:59.079
No, I am here to discuss the matter
concerning my daughter's lunches with you.

43:00.163 --> 43:01.832
- Lunch?
- Correct.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.835
Can I go get a snack?

43:04.835 --> 43:07.546
Yeah. Sure, honey. Go see Sharon.

43:13.760 --> 43:17.097
I'm sorry, who are you,
and why are you in my office right now?

43:17.681 --> 43:20.058
I am Elizabeth Zott,
Madeline Zott's mother.

43:21.143 --> 43:21.977
Have a seat.

43:21.977 --> 43:24.521
No, this is not
a seated kind of conversation.

43:25.314 --> 43:28.358
Your daughter has been taking
my daughter's lunch every day for months.

43:28.942 --> 43:31.361
Which really just leads me to wonder,

43:31.361 --> 43:34.907
is she not having nutritious meals
provided to her by her provider?

43:34.907 --> 43:39.453
Okay. My daughter's extremely well-fed.

43:40.037 --> 43:42.039
I'm aware, because
I'm the one that's been feeding her.

43:43.040 --> 43:44.082
Mr. Pine.

43:44.082 --> 43:48.086
I do wish that I had the time or
the resources to feed both our daughters,

43:48.086 --> 43:50.297
but as it stands, I have two jobs.

43:50.297 --> 43:52.674
Well, three if you consider
being a parent, which I do.

43:52.674 --> 43:55.469
And as a parent,
I will not compromise on good food.

43:55.469 --> 43:58.347
Good food is a primary catalyst
from which my daughter will grow.

43:58.347 --> 44:00.891
Good food is not a hobby. It--

44:00.891 --> 44:03.185
It is community, it is family,
and it is essential.

44:04.686 --> 44:08.315
Out of concern for your daughter,
I brought my chicken pot pie recipe.

44:09.900 --> 44:12.736
Along with a sample so that you can taste
the crumble of the crust

44:12.736 --> 44:14.154
and the viscosity of the filling.

44:14.780 --> 44:19.535
I also have oatmeal cookies or-- No.
I'm going to keep these on principle.

44:21.453 --> 44:23.121
Well, I'll leave one, for Amanda.

44:23.789 --> 44:25.832
Do not split that cookie with your father.

44:30.295 --> 44:31.296
He wasn't very busy.

44:58.532 --> 44:59.616
What?

45:06.540 --> 45:08.000
Hey.

45:12.087 --> 45:14.506
- Have you lost your mind?
- Sorry.

45:16.675 --> 45:18.093
I'm a television producer,

45:18.093 --> 45:22.764
and I believe that you are poised
to become a force in afternoon TV.

45:22.764 --> 45:25.267
Which is why I would like
to offer you a job

45:26.059 --> 45:30.355
as the new host
of RBLA TV's latest cooking show.

45:32.316 --> 45:33.358
Are you concussed?

45:34.401 --> 45:35.235
No.

45:35.235 --> 45:40.490
Mr. Pine, I am a scientist.
A scientist who does not watch television.

45:40.490 --> 45:42.993
Please, just think about it.

45:45.662 --> 45:48.707
And I did. I've considered it.
Please move your feet.

45:57.132 --> 46:00.385
I was raising my hand,
but she wasn't looking at me.

46:00.385 --> 46:01.720
Schemes.

46:05.349 --> 46:06.308
Why?
