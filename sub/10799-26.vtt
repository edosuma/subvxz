00:01.625 --> 00:05.208
<i>Captain's Log,</i>

00:01.625 --> 00:05.208
<i>Stardate 43989.1.</i>

00:05.250 --> 00:07.834
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> has arrived</i>

00:05.250 --> 00:07.834
<i>at Jouret IV</i>

00:07.875 --> 00:09.750
<i>in response</i>

00:07.875 --> 00:09.750
<i>to a distress signal</i>

00:09.792 --> 00:12.875
<i>from one of the Federation's</i>

00:09.792 --> 00:12.875
<i>outermost colonies.</i>

00:15.917 --> 00:17.875
Anything from the surface?

00:17.917 --> 00:19.959
No, sir. There have

00:17.917 --> 00:19.959
been no communications

00:20.000 --> 00:21.709
from the colony

00:20.000 --> 00:21.709
for over 12 hours.

00:21.750 --> 00:23.166
Sensors picking up

00:21.750 --> 00:23.166
any signs of life?

00:23.208 --> 00:24.375
None.

00:24.417 --> 00:25.417
The surface environment

00:25.458 --> 00:27.542
is safe for transport,

00:25.458 --> 00:27.542
Commander.

00:46.417 --> 00:47.917
Mr. O'Brien.

00:47.959 --> 00:50.041
Verify these are

00:47.959 --> 00:50.041
accurate coordinates

00:50.083 --> 00:52.000
for the New Providence colony.

00:52.041 --> 00:53.333
Coordinates verified, sir.

00:53.375 --> 00:55.625
You're at the center of town.

01:46.041 --> 01:50.458
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

01:50.500 --> 01:54.667
<i>These are the voyages</i>

01:50.500 --> 01:54.667
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

01:54.709 --> 01:56.583
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

01:56.625 --> 02:00.250
<i>to explore</i>

01:56.625 --> 02:00.250
<i>strange new worlds</i>

02:00.291 --> 02:04.500
<i>to seek out new life</i>

02:00.291 --> 02:04.500
<i>and new civilizations</i>

02:04.542 --> 02:09.375
<i>to boldly go</i>

02:04.542 --> 02:09.375
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

03:08.375 --> 03:11.583
<i>Captain's Log,</i>

03:08.375 --> 03:11.583
<i>Stardate 43992.6.</i>

03:11.625 --> 03:13.917
<i>Admiral Hanson and Lieutenant</i>

03:11.625 --> 03:13.917
<i>Commander Shelby</i>

03:13.959 --> 03:15.375
<i>of Starfleet Tactical</i>

03:15.417 --> 03:16.834
<i>have arrived to review</i>

03:15.417 --> 03:16.834
<i>the disappearance</i>

03:16.875 --> 03:18.291
<i>of New Providence colony.</i>

03:18.333 --> 03:21.792
<i>No sign remains</i>

03:18.333 --> 03:21.792
<i>of the 900 inhabitants.</i>

03:21.834 --> 03:24.000
The truth is...

03:24.041 --> 03:26.458
hell, we are not ready.

03:26.500 --> 03:29.667
We've known they were coming

03:26.500 --> 03:29.667
for over a year.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.792
We've thrown every resource we

03:29.709 --> 03:31.792
have into this, but still...

03:31.834 --> 03:33.083
RIKER:

03:31.834 --> 03:33.083
Then you're

03:31.834 --> 03:33.083
convinced

03:33.125 --> 03:34.125
it is the Borg.

03:34.166 --> 03:36.000
That's what I'm here

03:34.166 --> 03:36.000
to find out.

03:36.041 --> 03:38.500
The initial descriptions

03:36.041 --> 03:38.500
of the surface conditions

03:38.542 --> 03:41.375
are almost identical

03:38.542 --> 03:41.375
to your report from System J-25.

03:41.417 --> 03:42.917
Commander Riker

03:41.417 --> 03:42.917
wrote those reports.

03:42.959 --> 03:44.000
He agrees with you.

03:44.041 --> 03:45.375
Commander Shelby

03:45.417 --> 03:49.250
took over Borg tactical analysis

03:45.417 --> 03:49.250
six months ago.

03:49.291 --> 03:51.333
I've learned to give her

03:49.291 --> 03:51.333
a wide latitude

03:51.375 --> 03:53.458
when I want

03:51.375 --> 03:53.458
to get things done.

03:53.500 --> 03:56.458
That's how I intend

03:53.500 --> 03:56.458
to operate here.

03:56.500 --> 03:59.333
My priority has been

03:56.500 --> 03:59.333
to develop some kind--

03:59.375 --> 04:01.208
any kind--

03:59.375 --> 04:01.208
of defense strategy.

04:01.250 --> 04:03.750
Obviously, nothing we have now

04:01.250 --> 04:03.750
can stop them.

04:03.792 --> 04:05.417
We've been designing new weapons

04:05.458 --> 04:07.500
but they're all

04:05.458 --> 04:07.500
still on the drawing board.

04:07.542 --> 04:09.750
We expected much more lead time.

04:09.792 --> 04:11.667
Your encounter with the Borg

04:11.709 --> 04:13.959
was over 7,000

04:11.709 --> 04:13.959
light years away.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.375
If this<i> is</i> the Borg

04:15.417 --> 04:16.667
it would indicate they have

04:16.709 --> 04:19.250
a source of power

04:16.709 --> 04:19.250
far superior to our own.

04:19.291 --> 04:21.542
I'd like to see the colony site

04:19.291 --> 04:21.542
as soon as possible, Captain.

04:21.583 --> 04:22.959
It'll be dark there

04:21.583 --> 04:22.959
in 30 minutes.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.375
We've scheduled an away team

04:23.000 --> 04:24.375
for dawn.

04:24.417 --> 04:25.667
Number One,

04:24.417 --> 04:25.667
why don't you

04:25.709 --> 04:27.583
show the Commander

04:25.709 --> 04:27.583
to her quarters.

04:30.375 --> 04:32.375
It's our poker night,

04:30.375 --> 04:32.375
Admiral.

04:32.417 --> 04:35.083
There's always

04:32.417 --> 04:35.083
an open seat for you.

04:35.125 --> 04:37.083
Another time, Commander.

04:37.125 --> 04:39.250
Your Captain and I

04:37.125 --> 04:39.250
have a lot to cover.

04:39.291 --> 04:41.000
But, uh, rumor has it

04:41.041 --> 04:44.417
Commander Shelby has

04:41.041 --> 04:44.417
played a hand or two.

04:49.125 --> 04:51.709
Keep your eye on her, Jean-Luc.

04:51.750 --> 04:55.125
She's one very impressive

04:51.750 --> 04:55.125
young lady.

04:55.166 --> 04:57.625
You seem rather taken

04:55.166 --> 04:57.625
with her, J.P.

04:57.667 --> 05:00.375
Just an old man's fantasies.

05:02.083 --> 05:05.041
When Shelby came into Tactical,

05:02.083 --> 05:05.041
every admiral's uncle

05:05.083 --> 05:07.959
had a take

05:05.083 --> 05:07.959
on this Borg business.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.875
She cut through it.

05:09.917 --> 05:11.709
She put us on track.

05:13.291 --> 05:15.000
Earl Grey?

05:15.041 --> 05:16.500
Please.

05:16.542 --> 05:19.625
She'd make you one hell

05:16.542 --> 05:19.625
of a First Officer.

05:19.667 --> 05:22.333
Already have a hell

05:19.667 --> 05:22.333
of a First Officer.

05:22.375 --> 05:25.417
Don't tell me he's going

05:22.375 --> 05:25.417
to pass up another commission.

05:27.291 --> 05:28.583
One's available?

05:28.625 --> 05:29.959
The<i> Melbourne.</i>

05:30.000 --> 05:31.291
It's his if he wants it.

05:31.333 --> 05:32.500
Hasn't he told you?

05:34.000 --> 05:36.417
He'll make a fine captain, J.P.

05:38.166 --> 05:40.667
You may want to tell<i> him</i> that.

05:40.709 --> 05:43.041
We're still waiting

05:40.709 --> 05:43.041
on his decision.

05:43.083 --> 05:45.291
This is the third time

05:45.333 --> 05:48.375
we've pulled out

05:45.333 --> 05:48.375
the Captain's chair for Riker.

05:48.417 --> 05:51.417
He just won't sit down.

05:51.458 --> 05:53.542
Well, let me tell you something,

05:51.458 --> 05:53.542
Jean-Luc--

05:53.583 --> 05:56.542
there are a lot

05:53.583 --> 05:56.542
of young hotshots like Shelby

05:56.583 --> 05:57.959
on the way up.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.375
Riker could suddenly look

05:59.417 --> 06:02.291
like he's standing still

05:59.417 --> 06:02.291
next to them.

06:02.333 --> 06:04.875
He's hurting his career

06:02.333 --> 06:04.875
by staying put.

06:04.917 --> 06:07.166
And if I were you,

06:04.917 --> 06:07.166
I'd kick him in the rear end

06:07.208 --> 06:09.417
for his own good.

06:16.250 --> 06:18.750
I don't know exactly

06:16.250 --> 06:18.750
what I'm looking for

06:18.792 --> 06:21.208
but we've tested

06:18.792 --> 06:21.208
the sections of the

06:18.792 --> 06:21.208
<i>Enterprise's</i> hull

06:21.250 --> 06:22.792
that were damaged

06:21.250 --> 06:22.792
by the Borg.

06:22.834 --> 06:25.417
There were some unusual

06:22.834 --> 06:25.417
magnetic-resonance traces.

06:25.458 --> 06:27.333
A Borg footprint?

06:27.375 --> 06:29.041
That's my theory.

06:29.083 --> 06:31.041
I'll see if it holds up

06:29.083 --> 06:31.041
tomorrow.

06:31.083 --> 06:32.083
I've reviewed your personnel.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.625
I'll be assigning Mr. La Forge

06:33.667 --> 06:36.375
and Mr. Data

06:33.667 --> 06:36.375
to accompany me

06:33.667 --> 06:36.375
on the away team.

06:36.417 --> 06:39.792
I've already assigned them

06:36.417 --> 06:39.792
to the away team.

06:39.834 --> 06:42.375
And I'll be with you as well,

06:39.834 --> 06:42.375
Commander.

06:42.417 --> 06:43.875
Of course.

06:43.917 --> 06:46.583
I appreciate any assistance

06:43.917 --> 06:46.583
you can offer.

06:46.625 --> 06:48.875
Tell me, Commander.

06:48.917 --> 06:50.709
Is serving aboard the<i> Enterprise</i>

06:50.750 --> 06:53.000
as extraordinary an experience

06:50.750 --> 06:53.000
as I've heard?

06:53.041 --> 06:54.875
Every bit.

06:54.917 --> 06:58.875
Good, because I intend

06:54.917 --> 06:58.875
to convince Captain Picard

06:58.917 --> 07:00.834
that I'm the right choice

06:58.917 --> 07:00.834
for the job.

07:00.875 --> 07:02.917
Job? Which job?

07:02.959 --> 07:04.875
Yours, of course.

07:06.542 --> 07:09.333
I'm sorry.

07:09.375 --> 07:11.625
I heard that you were leaving.

07:11.667 --> 07:16.709
If I were, I'm sure

07:11.667 --> 07:16.709
you'd be the first to know.

07:19.125 --> 07:24.583
Poker's at 1700 hours

07:19.125 --> 07:24.583
in my quarters, deck eight.

07:28.667 --> 07:30.667
Got another king

07:28.667 --> 07:30.667
in the hole, eh, Data?

07:30.709 --> 07:33.208
I am afraid I cannot

07:30.709 --> 07:33.208
answer that, Wesley

07:33.250 --> 07:35.000
and as you are a

07:33.250 --> 07:35.000
newcomer to the game

07:35.041 --> 07:37.750
may I say, it is

07:35.041 --> 07:37.750
inappropriate

07:35.041 --> 07:37.750
for you to ask.

07:37.792 --> 07:39.458
(<i> players chuckle</i> )

07:39.500 --> 07:41.667
I will buy

07:39.500 --> 07:41.667
another card, Counselor.

07:41.709 --> 07:44.291
No help there.

07:44.333 --> 07:47.291
Fold. Again.

07:47.333 --> 07:50.667
Three jacks looking back

07:47.333 --> 07:50.667
for the handsome young ensign.

07:50.709 --> 07:53.792
Pair of deuces stands.

07:53.834 --> 07:57.417
Flush, possible

07:53.834 --> 07:57.417
straight flush.

07:57.458 --> 07:58.959
Hmm.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.083
Your bet, Mr. Crusher.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.250
I'm in for ten.

08:05.291 --> 08:06.959
Call.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.166
Now it's time

08:07.000 --> 08:09.166
for the long pants.

08:09.208 --> 08:12.000
There's your ten. 100.

08:12.041 --> 08:13.667
He's got the straight

08:12.041 --> 08:13.667
flush, folks.

08:13.709 --> 08:15.333
Not necessarily.

08:15.375 --> 08:18.542
Commander Riker

08:15.375 --> 08:18.542
may be bluffing, Wesley.

08:23.500 --> 08:25.667
I don't think so.

08:23.500 --> 08:25.667
Fold.

08:25.709 --> 08:27.750
With three jacks?

08:25.709 --> 08:27.750
What, are you kidding?

08:27.792 --> 08:29.458
Wesley, you may get

08:27.792 --> 08:29.458
straight A's in school

08:29.500 --> 08:32.000
but there's a lot you

08:29.500 --> 08:32.000
need to learn about poker.

08:34.041 --> 08:37.291
Well, I've only got two pair

08:37.333 --> 08:40.333
but I've got to see

08:37.333 --> 08:40.333
your hole card.

08:40.375 --> 08:42.709
I'll call.

08:46.417 --> 08:49.875
(<i> Geordi chuckles</i> )

08:49.917 --> 08:52.291
You got him.

09:09.417 --> 09:11.709
Mr. Data and our guest

09:09.417 --> 09:11.709
appear to be tardy.

09:11.750 --> 09:13.834
Sir, Commander Shelby

09:11.750 --> 09:13.834
and Data beamed down

09:13.875 --> 09:15.625
to the planet's

09:13.875 --> 09:15.625
surface an hour ago.

09:15.667 --> 09:17.333
On whose authority?

09:17.375 --> 09:19.417
On hers, sir.

09:38.834 --> 09:39.959
Morning.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.834
Early bird gets

09:40.000 --> 09:41.834
the worm, eh?

09:41.875 --> 09:45.375
We've had some

09:41.875 --> 09:45.375
interesting results.

09:45.417 --> 09:47.709
Commander Shelby...

09:49.625 --> 09:52.041
Walk with me, Commander.

10:00.375 --> 10:01.959
Early bird?

10:02.000 --> 10:04.583
I believe

10:02.000 --> 10:04.583
Commander Shelby erred.

10:04.625 --> 10:06.458
There is no evidence

10:04.625 --> 10:06.458
of avifaunal

10:06.500 --> 10:08.875
or crawling vermicular

10:06.500 --> 10:08.875
life-forms on Jouret IV.

10:08.917 --> 10:11.291
That's not what

10:08.917 --> 10:11.291
she meant, Data

10:11.333 --> 10:14.834
but you're right--

10:11.333 --> 10:14.834
she erred.

10:18.583 --> 10:20.166
I'm sorry,

10:18.583 --> 10:20.166
but I woke up early

10:20.208 --> 10:22.208
and I saw that a weather

10:20.208 --> 10:22.208
system was moving in.

10:22.250 --> 10:23.834
It could have affected

10:22.250 --> 10:23.834
the soil readings.

10:23.875 --> 10:25.166
So without any regard

10:25.208 --> 10:26.750
for the risk of coming

10:25.208 --> 10:26.750
down here alone...

10:26.792 --> 10:29.291
Really, Commander,

10:26.792 --> 10:29.291
if we ran into the Borg here

10:29.333 --> 10:31.250
two extra bodies wouldn't have

10:29.333 --> 10:31.250
made a hell of a difference

10:31.291 --> 10:32.583
now, would they?

10:32.625 --> 10:34.583
We had three hours

10:32.625 --> 10:34.583
before the storm front hit

10:34.625 --> 10:35.959
less than two hours now.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.291
Data was available.

10:37.333 --> 10:38.583
I took him.

10:37.333 --> 10:38.583
We came.

10:38.625 --> 10:40.125
I don't see your problem.

10:40.166 --> 10:42.667
My problem, Commander, is

10:40.166 --> 10:42.667
I expect to be notified

10:42.709 --> 10:44.625
before there's a

10:42.709 --> 10:44.625
change in my orders.

10:44.667 --> 10:46.458
Noted for future reference.

10:46.500 --> 10:48.625
Do you wish to hear

10:46.500 --> 10:48.625
my report, sir?

10:48.667 --> 10:50.583
Go ahead.

10:50.625 --> 10:53.750
The soil contains the same

10:50.625 --> 10:53.750
magnetic-resonance traces.

10:53.792 --> 10:55.625
That's our footprint.

10:55.667 --> 10:57.333
There's no doubt anymore.

10:57.375 --> 10:59.417
It is the Borg.

11:03.917 --> 11:07.375
<i>Captain's Log,</i>

11:03.917 --> 11:07.375
<i>Stardate 43993.5.</i>

11:07.417 --> 11:10.250
<i>With confirmation of the Borg's</i>

11:07.417 --> 11:10.250
presence in Federation space

11:10.291 --> 11:12.834
<i>Admiral Hanson has returned</i>

11:10.291 --> 11:12.834
<i>to Starbase 324</i>

11:12.875 --> 11:15.417
<i>to discuss strategy</i>

11:12.875 --> 11:15.417
<i>with Starfleet Command.</i>

11:15.458 --> 11:17.834
<i>Lieutenant Commander Shelby</i>

11:15.458 --> 11:17.834
<i>remains onboard</i>

11:17.875 --> 11:20.834
<i>to continue</i>

11:17.875 --> 11:20.834
<i>tactical preparations.</i>

11:20.875 --> 11:23.166
I've also ordered

11:20.875 --> 11:23.166
a standing Yellow Alert.

11:23.208 --> 11:25.417
All Federation-allied outposts

11:23.208 --> 11:25.417
have been warned.

11:25.458 --> 11:28.250
Ops will continue to monitor

11:25.458 --> 11:28.250
long-range sensors.

11:28.291 --> 11:30.083
I've assigned Data,

11:28.291 --> 11:30.083
La Forge and Mr. Crusher

11:30.125 --> 11:31.291
to work

11:30.125 --> 11:31.291
with Commander Shelby.

11:31.333 --> 11:32.333
Good.

11:32.375 --> 11:34.250
You've covered all the bases.

11:35.375 --> 11:38.500
What's your impression

11:35.375 --> 11:38.500
of Shelby?

11:38.542 --> 11:40.125
She knows her stuff.

11:40.166 --> 11:41.375
She has your

11:40.166 --> 11:41.375
full confidence?

11:41.417 --> 11:43.917
Well, I think she

11:41.417 --> 11:43.917
needs supervision.

11:43.959 --> 11:46.125
She takes the initiative

11:43.959 --> 11:46.125
a little too easily--

11:46.166 --> 11:47.083
sometimes with risks.

11:47.125 --> 11:48.667
(<i> tsking</i> )

11:48.709 --> 11:50.750
Sounds like a young

11:48.709 --> 11:50.750
Lieutenant Commander

11:50.792 --> 11:52.291
I recruited

11:50.792 --> 11:52.291
as a First Officer.

11:52.333 --> 11:53.917
Perhaps.

11:56.458 --> 11:58.166
Will...

12:00.542 --> 12:03.166
what the hell are you

12:00.542 --> 12:03.166
still doing here?

12:03.208 --> 12:04.500
Sir?

12:04.542 --> 12:07.083
You've been offered

12:04.542 --> 12:07.083
the<i> Melbourne.</i>

12:07.125 --> 12:09.959
I've decided not to pursue

12:07.125 --> 12:09.959
that commission at this time.

12:10.041 --> 12:12.375
She's a fine ship, Will.

12:12.417 --> 12:15.417
Yes, but she's not the

12:12.417 --> 12:15.417
<i>Enterprise.</i>

12:15.458 --> 12:20.250
With all due respect, sir,

12:15.458 --> 12:20.250
you need me, particularly now.

12:20.291 --> 12:25.166
Indeed. Starfleet needs

12:20.291 --> 12:25.166
good Captains, particularly now.

12:25.208 --> 12:26.917
Reconsider your decision.

12:28.041 --> 12:30.166
Are you telling me to leave,

12:28.041 --> 12:30.166
Captain?

12:30.208 --> 12:34.917
I'm asking you to look

12:30.208 --> 12:34.917
at your career objectively.

12:34.959 --> 12:40.917
Will, you're ready

12:34.959 --> 12:40.917
to work without a net.

12:40.959 --> 12:43.500
You're ready

12:40.959 --> 12:43.500
to take command

12:43.542 --> 12:46.208
and, you know,<i> Enterprise</i>

12:46.250 --> 12:49.500
will go along

12:46.250 --> 12:49.500
just fine without you.

12:49.542 --> 12:51.625
What am I still doing here?

12:51.667 --> 12:54.792
Deanna, I pushed myself

12:51.667 --> 12:54.792
hard to get this far.

12:54.834 --> 12:57.792
I... I sacrificed a lot.

12:57.834 --> 12:59.333
I always said I wanted

12:57.834 --> 12:59.333
my own command

12:59.375 --> 13:02.125
and yet... something's

12:59.375 --> 13:02.125
holding me back.

13:02.166 --> 13:04.083
Is it wrong for me

13:02.166 --> 13:04.083
to want to stay?

13:04.125 --> 13:05.667
What do you think?

13:07.208 --> 13:09.375
(<i> sighs</i> )

13:11.291 --> 13:14.250
Maybe I'm just afraid

13:11.291 --> 13:14.250
of the big chair.

13:14.291 --> 13:16.959
I don't think so.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.166
The Captain says

13:19.208 --> 13:21.542
Shelby reminds him

13:19.208 --> 13:21.542
of the way that I used to be

13:21.583 --> 13:22.959
and he's right.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.625
She comes in here

13:23.000 --> 13:25.625
full of drive and ambition.

13:25.667 --> 13:28.000
Impatient, taking risks.

13:28.041 --> 13:30.333
I look at her and I wonder what

13:28.041 --> 13:30.333
happened to those things in me.

13:30.375 --> 13:33.458
I liked those things about me.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.250
I've lost something.

13:35.291 --> 13:39.959
You mean, you're older,

13:35.291 --> 13:39.959
more experienced

13:40.000 --> 13:42.458
a little more... seasoned.

13:42.500 --> 13:44.959
"Seasoned."

13:45.000 --> 13:48.500
That's a horrible

13:45.000 --> 13:48.500
thing to say to a man.

13:48.542 --> 13:50.834
I don't think

13:48.542 --> 13:50.834
you've lost a thing.

13:50.875 --> 13:54.250
And I think you've gained

13:50.875 --> 13:54.250
more than you realize.

13:54.291 --> 13:56.208
You're much more

13:54.291 --> 13:56.208
comfortable with yourself

13:56.250 --> 13:57.458
than you used to be.

13:57.500 --> 13:59.458
Maybe that's the problem--

13:59.500 --> 14:01.375
I'm too comfortable here.

14:01.417 --> 14:04.542
I'm not sure

14:01.417 --> 14:04.542
I know what that means.

14:04.583 --> 14:06.709
You're happy here

14:06.750 --> 14:09.959
happier than I've

14:06.750 --> 14:09.959
ever known you to be.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.333
So... it comes down

14:10.000 --> 14:14.333
to a simple question.

14:14.375 --> 14:17.125
What do you want, Will Riker?

14:20.667 --> 14:23.458
SHELBY:

14:20.667 --> 14:23.458
...a manipulation effect in the

14:20.667 --> 14:23.458
Borg ship's subspace field.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.875
A definite pattern

14:23.500 --> 14:25.875
at 4.8 minute intervals

14:25.917 --> 14:27.875
during your first

14:25.917 --> 14:27.875
confrontation with them.

14:27.917 --> 14:31.500
It might indicate

14:27.917 --> 14:31.500
high-output auxiliary

14:27.917 --> 14:31.500
generators kicking in.

14:31.542 --> 14:33.875
One theory is that their

14:31.542 --> 14:33.875
systems are decentralized

14:33.917 --> 14:36.625
with redundant power sources

14:33.917 --> 14:36.625
located throughout the ship.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.875
That is a reasonable conclusion.

14:38.917 --> 14:41.625
Borg technology has given

14:38.917 --> 14:41.625
each member of their society

14:41.667 --> 14:43.125
the ability to interface

14:43.166 --> 14:44.667
and function

14:43.166 --> 14:44.667
collectively.

14:44.709 --> 14:46.625
It is likely they

14:44.709 --> 14:46.625
have constructed their ship

14:46.667 --> 14:48.041
with the same philosophy.

14:48.083 --> 14:49.542
You knock out one generator

14:49.583 --> 14:51.709
and another one takes over

14:49.583 --> 14:51.709
without interruption.

14:51.750 --> 14:54.291
What kind of damage would we

14:51.750 --> 14:54.291
have to do to shut them down?

14:54.333 --> 14:56.917
Projections suggest

14:54.333 --> 14:56.917
that a Borg ship like this one

14:56.959 --> 14:58.166
could continue

14:56.959 --> 14:58.166
to function effectively

14:58.208 --> 15:00.917
even if 78% of it

14:58.208 --> 15:00.917
was inoperable.

15:00.959 --> 15:01.959
And our best shot

15:02.000 --> 15:03.500
barely scratched

15:02.000 --> 15:03.500
the surface.

15:03.542 --> 15:05.375
Well, from what I've seen

15:05.417 --> 15:07.542
I can't believe that any

15:05.417 --> 15:07.542
of these new weapon systems

15:07.583 --> 15:10.083
can be ready in less

15:07.583 --> 15:10.083
than 18 months, Commander.

15:10.125 --> 15:12.291
We've been projecting 24.

15:12.333 --> 15:13.583
Is there anything we can do here

15:13.625 --> 15:15.667
to adapt

15:13.625 --> 15:15.667
our current defense systems?

15:15.709 --> 15:20.792
We'll have to go through

15:15.709 --> 15:20.792
the specs again, but...

15:20.834 --> 15:22.083
I don't know.

15:22.125 --> 15:23.959
My mind's turned to clay.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.709
Mine, too.

15:26.750 --> 15:27.959
I think we should look

15:28.000 --> 15:29.667
at modifying

15:28.000 --> 15:29.667
the plasma phaser design.

15:29.709 --> 15:31.792
Commander, I think

15:29.709 --> 15:31.792
we should call it a night.

15:31.834 --> 15:32.792
That's an order.

15:32.834 --> 15:34.333
We'll reconvene at 0500.

15:34.375 --> 15:36.583
Sir, if I may be allowed

15:34.375 --> 15:36.583
to continue with Mr. Data

15:36.625 --> 15:38.083
who does not require rest.

15:38.125 --> 15:39.959
<i>You</i> need rest, Commander.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.583
If we have a confrontation

15:40.000 --> 15:41.583
with the Borg

15:41.625 --> 15:43.250
without improving

15:41.625 --> 15:43.250
our defense systems...

15:43.291 --> 15:44.959
If we have a confrontation

15:45.000 --> 15:46.583
I don't want a crew

15:45.000 --> 15:46.583
fighting the Borg

15:46.625 --> 15:49.083
at the same time they're

15:46.625 --> 15:49.083
fighting their own fatigue.

15:49.125 --> 15:50.583
Dismissed.

16:05.625 --> 16:07.083
At 1900 hours yesterday

16:07.125 --> 16:10.250
the USS<i> Lalo</i>

16:07.125 --> 16:10.250
departed Zeta Alpha II

16:10.291 --> 16:13.291
on a freight run

16:10.291 --> 16:13.291
to Sentinel Minor IV.

16:13.333 --> 16:16.083
At 2200 hours and 12 minutes

16:16.125 --> 16:20.959
a distress signal was received

16:16.125 --> 16:20.959
at Starbase 157.

16:21.041 --> 16:24.542
The<i> Lalo</i> reported contact

16:21.041 --> 16:24.542
with an alien vessel

16:24.583 --> 16:28.125
described as cube-shaped.

16:28.166 --> 16:31.250
The distress signal

16:28.166 --> 16:31.250
ended abruptly

16:31.291 --> 16:33.291
and she has not been

16:31.291 --> 16:33.291
heard from since.

16:33.333 --> 16:36.291
Mr. Data, how long would it take

16:33.333 --> 16:36.291
to get there at warp nine?

16:36.333 --> 16:37.917
One hour,

16:36.333 --> 16:37.917
17 minutes, sir.

16:37.959 --> 16:39.500
Make it so.

16:39.542 --> 16:41.000
We're coming

16:39.542 --> 16:41.000
with every available starship

16:41.041 --> 16:42.333
to assist, Captain

16:42.375 --> 16:46.709
but the closest help

16:42.375 --> 16:46.709
is six days away.

16:46.750 --> 16:50.083
We'll try and keep them

16:46.750 --> 16:50.083
occupied until you arrive.

16:50.125 --> 16:52.458
I know you will.

16:52.500 --> 16:55.041
Hanson out.

16:55.083 --> 16:56.750
All hands stand

16:55.083 --> 16:56.750
to battle stations.

16:56.792 --> 16:58.166
Commander Shelby

16:58.208 --> 17:00.458
what is the status

16:58.208 --> 17:00.458
of our defense preparations?

17:00.500 --> 17:02.375
Mr. La Forge has a plan

17:00.500 --> 17:02.375
to modulate shield nutation.

17:02.417 --> 17:03.917
Hopefully, that'll

17:02.417 --> 17:03.917
hold them off

17:02.417 --> 17:03.917
for a while.

17:03.959 --> 17:05.709
LA FORGE:

17:03.959 --> 17:05.709
At the same

17:03.959 --> 17:05.709
time, we'll be

17:05.750 --> 17:08.000
retuning phasers to higher

17:05.750 --> 17:08.000
EM base emitting frequencies

17:08.041 --> 17:09.959
try to disrupt

17:08.041 --> 17:09.959
their subspace field.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.458
What's your assessment

17:10.000 --> 17:12.458
of our potential effectiveness?

17:12.500 --> 17:15.625
(<i> sighs</i> ):

17:12.500 --> 17:15.625
It's a shot in the dark, Captain

17:15.667 --> 17:17.500
but, for now,

17:15.667 --> 17:17.500
it's the best we can do.

17:17.542 --> 17:20.125
Dismissed.

17:42.750 --> 17:44.041
(<i> console beeping</i> )

17:44.083 --> 17:46.750
Sir, reading

17:44.083 --> 17:46.750
unidentified vessel

17:46.792 --> 17:48.583
just entering

17:46.792 --> 17:48.583
sensor range

17:48.625 --> 17:51.375
bearing 210

17:48.625 --> 17:51.375
mark 151.

17:51.417 --> 17:54.250
Hail them, Mr. Worf.

17:54.291 --> 17:56.291
No response, sir.

17:56.333 --> 17:57.625
Move to intercept.

17:57.667 --> 17:59.333
WESLEY:

17:57.667 --> 17:59.333
Aye, sir.

17:59.375 --> 18:02.291
Sir, the vessel

17:59.375 --> 18:02.291
has already changed course

18:02.333 --> 18:03.834
to intercept us.

18:03.875 --> 18:07.208
Approaching

18:03.875 --> 18:07.208
at warp 9.3.

18:07.250 --> 18:08.709
Entering visual range.

18:08.750 --> 18:11.417
On screen.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.041
Magnify.

18:21.542 --> 18:24.625
Mr. Worf, dispatch

18:21.542 --> 18:24.625
a subspace message

18:24.667 --> 18:26.917
to Admiral Hanson.

18:26.959 --> 18:30.041
We have engaged the Borg.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.792
WORF:

18:44.291 --> 18:46.792
Captain,<i> you</i>

18:44.291 --> 18:46.792
are being hailed.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.500
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

18:46.834 --> 18:48.500
I am?

18:48.542 --> 18:51.417
Yes, Captain--

18:48.542 --> 18:51.417
by name.

18:51.458 --> 18:55.375
Data, is it the same ship

18:51.458 --> 18:55.375
we faced at J-25?

18:55.417 --> 18:56.917
Uncertain,

18:55.417 --> 18:56.917
Commander.

18:56.959 --> 19:00.875
But the dimensions

18:56.959 --> 19:00.875
are precisely the same.

19:00.917 --> 19:03.667
On screen.

19:03.709 --> 19:05.625
I am Captain Jean-Luc...

19:05.667 --> 19:08.917
BORG VOICES:

19:05.667 --> 19:08.917
...Jean-Luc Picard, Captain

19:05.667 --> 19:08.917
of the Starship<i> Enterprise</i>

19:08.959 --> 19:12.375
registry NCC-1701-D.

19:12.417 --> 19:14.333
You will lower your shields

19:12.417 --> 19:14.333
and prepare

19:14.375 --> 19:17.166
to transport yourself

19:14.375 --> 19:17.166
aboard our vessel.

19:17.208 --> 19:19.709
If you do not cooperate,

19:17.208 --> 19:19.709
we will destroy your ship.

19:19.750 --> 19:21.375
You have committed acts

19:19.750 --> 19:21.375
of aggression

19:21.417 --> 19:23.250
against the United Federation

19:21.417 --> 19:23.250
of Planets.

19:23.291 --> 19:25.041
If you do not withdraw

19:23.291 --> 19:25.041
immediately...

19:25.083 --> 19:26.667
You will surrender yourself

19:26.709 --> 19:28.125
or we will destroy your ship.

19:28.166 --> 19:29.750
Your defensive capabilities

19:29.792 --> 19:31.917
are unable to withstand...

19:31.959 --> 19:34.000
What the hell

19:31.959 --> 19:34.000
do they want with you?

19:34.041 --> 19:36.291
I thought they weren't

19:34.041 --> 19:36.291
interested in human life-forms--

19:36.333 --> 19:37.750
only our technology.

19:37.792 --> 19:39.750
Their priorities seem

19:37.792 --> 19:39.750
to have changed.

19:39.792 --> 19:40.917
Open.

19:40.959 --> 19:42.500
WORF:

19:40.959 --> 19:42.500
Channel open.

19:42.542 --> 19:45.250
We have developed new

19:42.542 --> 19:45.250
defense capabilities

19:45.291 --> 19:48.166
since our last meeting,

19:45.291 --> 19:48.166
and we are prepared to use them

19:48.208 --> 19:51.250
if you do not withdraw

19:48.208 --> 19:51.250
from Federation space.

19:51.291 --> 19:52.542
LA FORGE:

19:51.291 --> 19:52.542
Captain

19:52.583 --> 19:54.458
shields are being probed.

19:54.500 --> 19:57.291
I'm modulating nutation.

20:01.083 --> 20:03.583
Captain, the Borg are

20:01.083 --> 20:03.583
attempting to lock onto us

20:01.083 --> 20:03.583
with their tractor beam.

20:03.625 --> 20:06.125
Load torpedo bays.

20:03.625 --> 20:06.125
Arm phasers.

20:06.166 --> 20:08.583
Lock coordinates on the source

20:06.166 --> 20:08.583
of the tractor beam.

20:08.625 --> 20:10.125
Shield status.

20:10.166 --> 20:12.000
Holding, sir.

20:12.041 --> 20:14.250
The nutation modulation

20:12.041 --> 20:14.250
has them confused.

20:14.291 --> 20:17.291
They have the ability

20:14.291 --> 20:17.291
to analyze and adapt, Commander.

20:21.375 --> 20:22.709
Shield modulation has failed.

20:22.750 --> 20:24.208
They've locked on.

20:26.875 --> 20:29.208
Shields are being drained.

20:29.250 --> 20:31.834
90%... 80...

20:31.875 --> 20:34.208
Trying to recalibrate nutation.

20:34.250 --> 20:35.208
Damn!

20:35.250 --> 20:36.542
Shields

20:35.250 --> 20:36.542
have failed.

20:36.583 --> 20:38.125
Fire all weapons.

20:44.166 --> 20:46.375
Their subspace field is intact.

20:46.417 --> 20:48.917
New phaser frequencies

20:46.417 --> 20:48.917
had no impact.

20:48.959 --> 20:50.166
Reverse engines.

20:50.208 --> 20:52.125
LA FORGE:

20:50.208 --> 20:52.125
Full reverse.

20:54.792 --> 20:56.250
We're not moving.

20:56.291 --> 20:57.291
Fire at will.

20:57.333 --> 20:58.834
Launching

20:57.333 --> 20:58.834

20:58.875 --> 21:00.750
Phaser spread

20:58.875 --> 21:00.750
continuing.

21:00.792 --> 21:04.083
Still no damage to

21:00.792 --> 21:04.083
the Borg vessel, sir.

21:09.417 --> 21:11.917
COMPUTER:

21:09.417 --> 21:11.917
Warning. Outer hull breach.

21:11.959 --> 21:13.500
They are cutting

21:11.959 --> 21:13.500
into the hull--

21:13.542 --> 21:14.709

21:14.750 --> 21:16.917
Geordi, evacuate

21:16.959 --> 21:19.083
Computer, evacuation sequence.

21:19.125 --> 21:20.750
Sealing doors to core chamber.

21:19.125 --> 21:20.750
Come on now.

21:20.792 --> 21:22.125
Let's move it, people!

21:20.792 --> 21:22.125
Let's move it. Let's go!

21:22.166 --> 21:23.583
COMPUTER:

21:22.166 --> 21:23.583
Warning. Inner hull failing.

21:23.625 --> 21:26.667
Decompression danger

21:23.625 --> 21:26.667

21:26.709 --> 21:28.458
Sealing Main Engineering.

21:28.500 --> 21:31.458
Data, fluctuate phaser

21:28.500 --> 21:31.458
resonance frequencies.

21:31.500 --> 21:33.041
Random settings,

21:31.500 --> 21:33.041
keep them changing.

21:33.083 --> 21:35.208
Don't give them time

21:33.083 --> 21:35.208
to adapt.

21:42.792 --> 21:44.500
The tractor beam

21:42.792 --> 21:44.500
has been released.

21:44.542 --> 21:45.583
Warp nine.

21:45.625 --> 21:49.917
Course 151 mark 330.

21:49.959 --> 21:51.792
Engage.

22:00.667 --> 22:02.583
They are in pursuit,

22:00.667 --> 22:02.583
Captain.

22:02.625 --> 22:05.250
Maintain course.

22:05.291 --> 22:06.917
Damage report, Geordi.

22:06.959 --> 22:10.000
Hull rupture

22:06.959 --> 22:10.000
in Main Engineering.

22:10.041 --> 22:13.083
The damage is pretty

22:10.041 --> 22:13.083
heavy. We lost a lot of

22:10.041 --> 22:13.083
good people down there.

22:13.125 --> 22:16.083
11 dead, eight more

22:13.125 --> 22:16.083
unaccounted for, Captain.

22:16.125 --> 22:17.834
Repair teams to Engineering.

22:16.125 --> 22:17.834
Seal hull breach.

22:17.875 --> 22:19.000
They didn't get to the core.

22:19.041 --> 22:21.250
I can control functions

22:19.041 --> 22:21.250
from here.

22:21.291 --> 22:23.709
Now approaching

22:21.291 --> 22:23.709
the Paulson Nebula, sir.

22:23.750 --> 22:26.583
Drop to impulse.

22:33.625 --> 22:35.875
Take us in, Ensign.

22:44.875 --> 22:47.000
The field's getting

22:44.875 --> 22:47.000
too dense, sir.

22:47.041 --> 22:48.792
Steady.

22:52.333 --> 22:54.625
Analysis of the nebula cloud,

22:52.333 --> 22:54.625
Mr. Data.

22:54.667 --> 22:57.625
82% dilithium

22:54.667 --> 22:57.625
hydroxyls...

22:57.667 --> 22:58.959
magnesium, chromium.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.583
Should provide

22:59.000 --> 23:00.583
an effective screen

23:00.625 --> 23:02.875
against their

23:00.625 --> 23:02.875
sensors, Captain.

23:02.917 --> 23:05.208
Mr. La Forge,

23:02.917 --> 23:05.208
prepare to reverse engines.

23:05.250 --> 23:06.709
Full stop.

23:17.959 --> 23:19.667
(<i> console beeps</i> )

23:19.709 --> 23:22.083
The Borg ship

23:19.709 --> 23:22.083
is continuing scans

23:22.125 --> 23:23.709
attempting to locate us.

23:23.750 --> 23:24.959
Good.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.041
As long as they're

23:25.000 --> 23:27.041
looking for us

23:27.083 --> 23:29.583
they won't hurt anyone else.

23:34.542 --> 23:36.375
Time index: 514.

23:36.417 --> 23:39.417
Data started to fluctuate

23:36.417 --> 23:39.417
phaser resonance frequencies.

23:39.458 --> 23:41.166
The Borg's beam breaks contact.

23:41.208 --> 23:45.333
Slow playback.

23:41.208 --> 23:45.333
Take a closer look,

23:41.208 --> 23:45.333
Commander. Mr. La Forge?

23:45.375 --> 23:47.917
LA FORGE:

23:45.375 --> 23:47.917
There's a two percent drop

23:45.375 --> 23:47.917
in power for an instant

23:47.959 --> 23:50.125
but it is system-wide.

23:50.166 --> 23:52.375
The phaser frequency spread

23:50.166 --> 23:52.375
was in a high narrow band.

23:52.417 --> 23:54.834
Conceivably, the ship's

23:52.417 --> 23:54.834
power distribution nodes

23:54.875 --> 23:56.667
are vulnerable

23:54.875 --> 23:56.667
to those frequencies.

23:56.709 --> 23:58.917
If we can generate

23:56.709 --> 23:58.917
a concentrated burst of power

23:58.959 --> 24:01.000
at that same

23:58.959 --> 24:01.000
frequency distribution--

24:01.041 --> 24:02.917
I mean a lot more than anything

24:01.041 --> 24:02.917
our phasers

24:02.959 --> 24:04.625
or photon torpedoes

24:02.959 --> 24:04.625
could ever provide...

24:04.667 --> 24:05.709
How do we do that?

24:05.750 --> 24:07.041
The main deflector dish.

24:07.083 --> 24:09.041
It's the only component

24:07.083 --> 24:09.041
on the<i> Enterprise</i>

24:09.083 --> 24:11.542
designed to channel

24:09.083 --> 24:11.542
that much power at

24:09.083 --> 24:11.542
controlled frequencies.

24:11.583 --> 24:13.250
End program.

24:13.291 --> 24:15.959
Unfortunately, there

24:13.291 --> 24:15.959
is one slight detail.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.291
In the process, the blast

24:17.333 --> 24:20.083
completely destroys the

24:17.333 --> 24:20.083
<i>Enterprise</i> as well.

24:20.125 --> 24:22.750
If we could get further away,

24:20.125 --> 24:22.750
increase the deflector's range.

24:22.792 --> 24:24.959
SHELBY:

24:22.792 --> 24:24.959
It could work.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
In the meantime, we should

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
retune all phasers

24:27.041 --> 24:29.166
including the hand units,

24:27.041 --> 24:29.166
to the same frequency.

24:29.208 --> 24:30.709
Proceed.

24:30.750 --> 24:31.834
I'll inform the Captain.

24:31.875 --> 24:33.000
There is one other

24:31.875 --> 24:33.000
recommendation

24:33.041 --> 24:34.500
I'd like to make, Commander.

24:34.542 --> 24:35.834
Separate the saucer section.

24:35.875 --> 24:38.291
Assign a skeleton crew

24:35.875 --> 24:38.291
to create a diversion.

24:38.333 --> 24:40.792
We may need the power from

24:38.333 --> 24:40.792
the saucer's impulse engines.

24:40.834 --> 24:43.125
But it would give them more

24:40.834 --> 24:43.125
than one target to worry about.

24:43.166 --> 24:44.625
It's too great a risk.

24:44.667 --> 24:47.208
I'd like the Captain

24:44.667 --> 24:47.208
to make that decision, sir.

24:47.250 --> 24:50.750
Commander,

24:47.250 --> 24:50.750
I bring all the alternatives

24:50.792 --> 24:52.291
to the Captain's attention.

24:52.333 --> 24:54.917
That will be all.

25:00.959 --> 25:03.125
I going to need to

25:00.959 --> 25:03.125
install higher capacity

25:00.959 --> 25:03.125
power transfers

25:03.166 --> 25:04.667
to the deflector

25:03.166 --> 25:04.667
dish, Commander.

25:03.166 --> 25:04.667
How long?

25:04.709 --> 25:07.458
Better part

25:04.709 --> 25:07.458
of a day.

25:07.500 --> 25:09.166
She gets a full head

25:07.500 --> 25:09.166
of steam, doesn't she?

25:09.208 --> 25:11.375
Mm-hmm. She's a formidable

25:09.208 --> 25:11.375
presence, to say the least

25:11.417 --> 25:13.625
but I'm convinced she can

25:11.417 --> 25:13.625
help us here, Commander.

25:13.667 --> 25:14.709
I am, too.

25:14.750 --> 25:15.834
Don't worry about it.

25:15.875 --> 25:17.500
I can handle Shelby.

25:20.333 --> 25:22.291
(<i> door chimes</i> )

25:20.333 --> 25:22.291
Come.

25:26.542 --> 25:29.166
Come in, Number One.

25:29.208 --> 25:30.792
Commander Shelby

25:29.208 --> 25:30.792
was just telling me

25:30.834 --> 25:35.417
of your... concerns

25:30.834 --> 25:35.417
about her plan.

25:35.458 --> 25:36.834
I'm sorry if she

25:35.458 --> 25:36.834
troubled you, sir.

25:36.875 --> 25:38.583
I have already

25:36.875 --> 25:38.583
informed her...

25:38.625 --> 25:40.208
PICARD:

25:38.625 --> 25:40.208
Yes, I entirely agree

25:38.625 --> 25:40.208
with you, Number One.

25:40.250 --> 25:42.667
It's not the time.

25:42.709 --> 25:44.709
But the time may come

25:44.750 --> 25:47.834
when we will be required

25:44.750 --> 25:47.834
to take greater risks.

25:47.875 --> 25:52.375
I want you to consider her plan

25:47.875 --> 25:52.375
as a fall-back position.

25:52.417 --> 25:54.166
Make the necessary preparations.

25:54.208 --> 25:56.291
Very good, sir.

26:05.542 --> 26:07.375
Deck eight,

26:05.542 --> 26:07.375
Battle Bridge.

26:07.417 --> 26:08.875
Halt.

26:08.917 --> 26:12.583
Commander, you and I need

26:08.917 --> 26:12.583
to have a conversation.

26:12.625 --> 26:15.667
You never ordered me not to

26:12.625 --> 26:15.667
discuss this with the Captain.

26:15.709 --> 26:17.667
You disagree with me--

26:15.709 --> 26:17.667
fine.

26:17.709 --> 26:20.041
You need to take it

26:17.709 --> 26:20.041
to the Captain-- fine.

26:20.083 --> 26:21.333
Through me.

26:21.375 --> 26:24.166
You do an end run

26:21.375 --> 26:24.166
around me again

26:24.208 --> 26:25.667
I'll snap you back so hard

26:25.709 --> 26:27.625
you'll think you're

26:25.709 --> 26:27.625
a first-year cadet again.

26:27.667 --> 26:29.959
May I speak frankly, sir?

26:30.000 --> 26:31.792
By all means.

26:31.834 --> 26:33.667
You're in my way.

26:33.709 --> 26:36.583
Really.

26:36.625 --> 26:38.667
How terrible for you.

26:38.709 --> 26:40.875
All you know how to do

26:38.709 --> 26:40.875
is play it safe.

26:40.917 --> 26:43.000
I suppose that's why

26:40.917 --> 26:43.000
someone like you

26:43.041 --> 26:44.583
sits in the shadow

26:43.041 --> 26:44.583
of a great man

26:44.625 --> 26:45.709
for as long as you have

26:45.750 --> 26:47.959
passing up one command

26:45.750 --> 26:47.959
after another.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.667
Proceed to deck eight.

26:50.709 --> 26:53.417
When it comes to this

26:50.709 --> 26:53.417
ship and this crew

26:53.458 --> 26:56.625
you're damned right

26:53.458 --> 26:56.625
I play it safe.

26:56.667 --> 26:59.583
If you can't make

26:56.667 --> 26:59.583
the big decisions, Commander

26:59.625 --> 27:02.542
I suggest you make room

26:59.625 --> 27:02.542
for someone who can.

27:15.917 --> 27:18.625
<i>Captain's Log,</i>

27:15.917 --> 27:18.625
<i>Stardate 43996.2.</i>

27:18.667 --> 27:20.834
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> remains</i>

27:18.667 --> 27:20.834
<i>concealed in the dust cloud.</i>

27:20.875 --> 27:24.125
<i>And, to my surprise, the Borg</i>

27:20.875 --> 27:24.125
<i>have maintained their position</i>

27:24.166 --> 27:25.917
<i>waiting for us</i>

27:24.166 --> 27:25.917
<i>to come out of hiding.</i>

27:25.959 --> 27:27.542
<i>I have no explanation</i>

27:27.583 --> 27:30.333
<i>for their special interest</i>

27:27.583 --> 27:30.333
<i>in me or this ship.</i>

27:30.375 --> 27:32.375
<i>We continue to prepare</i>

27:30.375 --> 27:32.375
<i>our defenses</i>

27:32.417 --> 27:33.917
<i>for the inevitable</i>

27:32.417 --> 27:33.917

27:33.959 --> 27:36.834

27:33.959 --> 27:36.834
<i>on this night</i>

27:36.875 --> 27:38.792
<i>I contemplate</i>

27:36.875 --> 27:38.792
<i>the distinct possibility</i>

27:38.834 --> 27:41.417
<i>that no defense may be adequate</i>

27:38.834 --> 27:41.417
<i>against this enemy.</i>

27:41.458 --> 27:42.875
Captain.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.709
Trouble sleeping?

28:07.750 --> 28:11.458
It's something of a tradition,

28:07.750 --> 28:11.458
Guinan--

28:11.500 --> 28:14.959
Captain touring the ship

28:11.500 --> 28:14.959
before a battle.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.667
Oh.

28:16.709 --> 28:18.542
Before a<i> hopeless</i> battle

28:18.583 --> 28:21.166
if I remember

28:18.583 --> 28:21.166
the tradition correctly.

28:21.208 --> 28:23.125
Not necessarily.

28:23.166 --> 28:25.500
Nelson toured the HMS<i> Victory</i>

28:23.166 --> 28:25.500
<i>before Trafalgar.</i>

28:25.542 --> 28:29.834
Yes, but Nelson never returned

28:25.542 --> 28:29.834
from Trafalgar, did he?

28:29.875 --> 28:33.792
No, but the battle

28:29.875 --> 28:33.792
was won.

28:33.834 --> 28:37.750
Do you expect this

28:33.834 --> 28:37.750
battle to be won?

28:37.792 --> 28:41.250
We may yet prevail.

28:41.291 --> 28:44.583
That's... a conceit.

28:44.625 --> 28:47.875
But... it's a healthy one.

28:47.917 --> 28:50.458
I wonder if

28:47.917 --> 28:50.458
the Emperor Honorius

28:50.500 --> 28:53.875
watching the Visigoths

28:50.500 --> 28:53.875
coming over the seventh hill

28:53.917 --> 29:00.667
truly realized that the Roman

28:53.917 --> 29:00.667
Empire was about to fall.

29:00.709 --> 29:05.208
This is just another page

29:00.709 --> 29:05.208
in history, isn't it?

29:05.250 --> 29:08.875
Will this be the end

29:05.250 --> 29:08.875
of<i> our</i> civilization?

29:08.917 --> 29:11.375
Turn the page.

29:14.291 --> 29:16.583
This isn't the end.

29:16.625 --> 29:20.959
You say that

29:16.625 --> 29:20.959
with remarkable assuredness.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.166
With experience.

29:23.208 --> 29:25.458
When the Borg destroyed

29:23.208 --> 29:25.458
my world

29:25.500 --> 29:29.291
my people were scattered

29:25.500 --> 29:29.291
throughout the universe.

29:29.333 --> 29:31.208
We survived.

29:31.250 --> 29:34.166
As will humanity survive.

29:34.208 --> 29:36.750
As long as there's

29:34.208 --> 29:36.750
a handful of you

29:36.792 --> 29:38.500
to keep

29:36.792 --> 29:38.500
the spirit alive

29:38.542 --> 29:40.625
you<i> will</i> prevail.

29:40.667 --> 29:43.166
Even if it takes a millennium.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.917
(<i> explosion</i> )

29:46.959 --> 29:50.542
WORF:

29:46.959 --> 29:50.542
Captain Picard,

29:46.959 --> 29:50.542
report to the Bridge.

29:50.583 --> 29:53.208
I'm on my way, Lieutenant.

30:11.333 --> 30:14.709
They're some sort

30:11.333 --> 30:14.709
of magnetometric-guided charges.

30:19.375 --> 30:20.750
Status of shields?

30:20.792 --> 30:22.709
WORF:

30:20.792 --> 30:22.709
Back to 48%, Captain.

30:22.750 --> 30:25.125
Mr. La Forge, I may have

30:22.750 --> 30:25.125
to take us out of the nebula.

30:25.166 --> 30:26.875
I want all the power

30:25.166 --> 30:26.875
you can give me.

30:26.917 --> 30:28.250
Engines are ready, Captain.

30:28.291 --> 30:29.792
Recommend you adjust

30:28.291 --> 30:29.792
shield harmonics

30:29.834 --> 30:32.375
to favor the upper EM band

30:29.834 --> 30:32.375
when you proceed.

30:32.417 --> 30:34.208
Acknowledged.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.166
Direct hit, deck nine.

30:37.208 --> 30:38.583
Damage report.

30:38.625 --> 30:40.875
Structural latching system

30:38.625 --> 30:40.875
integrity breached.

30:40.917 --> 30:42.500
Prepare to take us

30:40.917 --> 30:42.500
out of here, Number One.

30:42.542 --> 30:43.625
Fire up the engines.

30:43.667 --> 30:45.125
Half impulse till we

30:43.667 --> 30:45.125
clear the nebula

30:45.166 --> 30:46.667
then punch it up

30:45.166 --> 30:46.667
to warp nine.

30:46.709 --> 30:48.959
Ready phasers, load

30:46.709 --> 30:48.959
forward torpedo bays.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.750
Engage.

30:58.333 --> 31:00.041
Borg tractor beam

30:58.333 --> 31:00.041
is attempting to lock on.

31:00.083 --> 31:01.291
Fire at will.

31:01.333 --> 31:02.834
Continue rotating

31:01.333 --> 31:02.834
shield frequency.

31:02.875 --> 31:03.959
(<i> console beeping</i> )

31:04.000 --> 31:05.291
Shields failing.

31:06.417 --> 31:07.959
(<i> insistent beeping</i> )

31:08.000 --> 31:09.875
Tractor beam<i> has</i> locked on.

31:29.625 --> 31:33.250
It's no use.

31:29.625 --> 31:33.250
They've already adapted

31:29.625 --> 31:33.250
to the new frequencies.

31:34.333 --> 31:35.500
(<i> grunts</i> )

32:01.709 --> 32:03.333
The Borg ship

32:01.709 --> 32:03.333
is disengaging.

32:03.375 --> 32:04.792
Leaving at

32:03.375 --> 32:04.792
warp speed.

32:04.834 --> 32:07.041
Maintain pursuit.

32:09.291 --> 32:14.709
Borg vessel has reached

32:09.291 --> 32:14.709
warp nine, 9.4, 9.6.

32:14.750 --> 32:15.750
Stay with them.

32:15.792 --> 32:17.125
Riker to O'Brien.

32:17.166 --> 32:18.208
Can you get a fix

32:17.166 --> 32:18.208
on the Captain?

32:18.250 --> 32:19.375
Negative, sir.

32:19.417 --> 32:20.667
There's some kind

32:19.417 --> 32:20.667
of interference.

32:20.709 --> 32:22.667
I can't lock in on his signal.

32:22.709 --> 32:25.083
Senior officers,

32:22.709 --> 32:25.083
report to the Bridge.

32:25.125 --> 32:27.000
Sir, the coordinates

32:25.125 --> 32:27.000
they have set--

32:27.041 --> 32:28.417
they are on a

32:27.041 --> 32:28.417
direct course

32:28.458 --> 32:34.625
to Sector 001--

32:28.458 --> 32:34.625
the Terran system.

32:34.667 --> 32:36.709
Earth.

33:04.959 --> 33:07.083
BORG VOICES:

33:04.959 --> 33:07.083
Captain Jean-Luc Picard

33:07.125 --> 33:09.709
you lead the strongest ship

33:07.125 --> 33:09.709
of the Federation fleet.

33:09.750 --> 33:11.834
You speak for your people.

33:11.875 --> 33:13.917
I have nothing to say to you

33:13.959 --> 33:17.750
and I will resist you

33:13.959 --> 33:17.750
with my last ounce of strength.

33:17.792 --> 33:19.166
Strength is irrelevant.

33:19.208 --> 33:20.875
Resistance is futile.

33:20.917 --> 33:22.875
We wish to improve ourselves.

33:22.917 --> 33:24.667
We will add your biological

33:24.709 --> 33:26.875
and technological

33:24.709 --> 33:26.875
distinctiveness to our own.

33:26.917 --> 33:30.375
Your culture will adapt

33:26.917 --> 33:30.375
to service ours.

33:30.417 --> 33:32.250
Impossible.

33:32.291 --> 33:35.917
My culture is based on freedom

33:32.291 --> 33:35.917
and self-determination.

33:35.959 --> 33:37.709
Freedom is irrelevant.

33:37.750 --> 33:39.750
Self-determination

33:37.750 --> 33:39.750
is irrelevant.

33:39.792 --> 33:41.667
You must comply.

33:41.709 --> 33:43.834
We would rather die.

33:43.875 --> 33:45.792
Death is irrelevant.

33:45.834 --> 33:48.834
Your archaic cultures

33:45.834 --> 33:48.834
are authority driven.

33:48.875 --> 33:51.792
To facilitate our introduction

33:48.875 --> 33:51.792
into your societies

33:51.834 --> 33:54.917
it has been decided that a human

33:51.834 --> 33:54.917
voice will speak for us

33:54.959 --> 33:56.250
in all communications.

33:56.291 --> 33:59.458
You have been chosen

33:56.291 --> 33:59.458
to be that voice.

34:06.250 --> 34:07.792
WORF:

34:06.250 --> 34:07.792
Commander, they

34:06.250 --> 34:07.792
are leading us

34:07.834 --> 34:09.750
into the heart

34:07.834 --> 34:09.750
of our own defenses.

34:09.792 --> 34:11.208
Yeah, well, so far,

34:09.792 --> 34:11.208
they haven't had

34:11.250 --> 34:13.542
much of a reason

34:11.250 --> 34:13.542
to worry about our defenses.

34:13.583 --> 34:16.333
Commander, if the Borg

34:13.583 --> 34:16.333
stay at warp 9.6

34:16.375 --> 34:17.709
we'll be forced

34:16.375 --> 34:17.709
to discontinue pursuit

34:17.750 --> 34:19.417
and power down

34:17.750 --> 34:19.417
in less than three hours.

34:19.458 --> 34:21.166
Two hours,

34:19.458 --> 34:21.166
40 minutes,

34:19.458 --> 34:21.166
three seconds.

34:21.208 --> 34:22.792
How long before

34:21.208 --> 34:22.792
the deflector's ready?

34:22.834 --> 34:24.875
We're close, a few hours maybe.

34:24.917 --> 34:27.083
I know-- I'll get it done

34:24.917 --> 34:27.083
in two somehow

34:27.125 --> 34:28.750
but, Commander, I'm going

34:27.125 --> 34:28.750
to need serious power

34:28.792 --> 34:30.875
from the warp engines

34:28.792 --> 34:30.875
to make this weapon work.

34:30.917 --> 34:32.083
So far, we're using

34:30.917 --> 34:32.083
everything we've got

34:32.125 --> 34:33.500
just to keep up with them.

34:33.542 --> 34:36.500
Sir, we've got to get that ship

34:33.542 --> 34:36.500
down to impulse.

34:36.542 --> 34:40.333
I'm leading an away team over

34:36.542 --> 34:40.333
there to get the Captain back.

34:40.375 --> 34:41.917
We'll find a way

34:40.375 --> 34:41.917
to get them out of warp.

34:41.959 --> 34:44.166
Ensign Crusher, you continue

34:41.959 --> 34:44.166
to assist Mr. La Forge.

34:44.208 --> 34:45.834
Commander Shelby,

34:44.208 --> 34:45.834
you'll take the Bridge

34:45.875 --> 34:47.000
and coordinate

34:45.875 --> 34:47.000
with Starfleet.

34:47.041 --> 34:48.959
Data, Worf, Doctor,

34:47.041 --> 34:48.959
you're with me.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.125
Excuse me, sir.

34:50.166 --> 34:51.250
With my knowledge

34:50.166 --> 34:51.250
of the Borg...

34:51.291 --> 34:53.166
Those are my

34:51.291 --> 34:53.166
orders, Commander!

34:53.208 --> 34:55.041
TROI:

34:53.208 --> 34:55.041
Commander Riker

34:55.083 --> 35:00.041
it is inappropriate for you

34:55.083 --> 35:00.041
to lead the away team.

35:00.083 --> 35:02.125
Until the return

35:00.083 --> 35:02.125
of Captain Picard

35:02.166 --> 35:04.333
you are in command

35:02.166 --> 35:04.333
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

35:04.375 --> 35:05.792
We're in

35:04.375 --> 35:05.792
a state of war

35:05.834 --> 35:08.291
and your place

35:05.834 --> 35:08.291
is on the Bridge.

35:13.750 --> 35:14.917
Commander Shelby

35:14.959 --> 35:16.709
you'll lead

35:14.959 --> 35:16.709
the away team.

35:16.750 --> 35:19.083
Make it so.

35:30.291 --> 35:33.542
<i>First Officer's Log,</i>

35:30.291 --> 35:33.542
<i>Stardate 43998.5.</i>

35:33.583 --> 35:35.000
<i>Our pursuit of the Borg</i>

35:35.041 --> 35:36.542
<i>continues on a course</i>

35:35.041 --> 35:36.542
<i>that will take us</i>

35:36.583 --> 35:38.458
<i>to the very core</i>

35:36.583 --> 35:38.458
<i>of the Federation.</i>

35:38.500 --> 35:41.500
<i>The devastation they could</i>

35:38.500 --> 35:41.500
<i>bring is beyond imagination.</i>

35:41.542 --> 35:44.667
These phasers

35:41.542 --> 35:44.667
have been retuned.

35:44.709 --> 35:47.625
Each has a different frequency

35:44.709 --> 35:47.625
spanning the upper EM band.

35:47.667 --> 35:49.583
All right, a reminder--

35:47.667 --> 35:49.583
we only get to use

35:49.625 --> 35:51.250
each of these once,

35:49.625 --> 35:51.250
maybe twice

35:51.291 --> 35:52.875
before the Borg

35:51.291 --> 35:52.875
learn to adapt.

35:52.917 --> 35:54.917
Don't fire

35:52.917 --> 35:54.917
until you have to.

35:54.959 --> 35:57.041
What kind of resistance

35:54.959 --> 35:57.041
should we expect?

35:57.083 --> 36:00.166
At our first encounter,

35:57.083 --> 36:00.166
the Borg virtually ignored us

36:00.208 --> 36:01.834
when we beamed aboard

36:00.208 --> 36:01.834
their vessel.

36:01.875 --> 36:04.375
Clearly, they did not consider

36:01.875 --> 36:04.375
our being there a threat.

36:04.417 --> 36:05.750
That may change, however

36:05.792 --> 36:08.709
if we start interfering

36:05.792 --> 36:08.709
with their plans.

36:15.750 --> 36:17.125
Shelby to Bridge.

36:17.166 --> 36:18.333
Away team ready.

36:18.375 --> 36:19.750
We've got 58 minutes

36:19.792 --> 36:21.625
before we have to power down

36:19.792 --> 36:21.625
and disengage.

36:21.667 --> 36:22.709
Understood.

36:22.750 --> 36:23.792
Proceed. Commander?

36:23.834 --> 36:26.583
No unnecessary risks.

36:23.834 --> 36:26.583
Clear?

36:26.625 --> 36:27.667
Very clear, sir.

36:27.709 --> 36:29.291
Shelby out.

36:29.333 --> 36:32.083
We've matched warp velocity

36:29.333 --> 36:32.083
for transport, Commander.

36:32.125 --> 36:33.625
Energize.

36:49.709 --> 36:51.875
WORF:

36:49.709 --> 36:51.875
Tricorder functions minimal.

36:51.917 --> 36:53.542
Any signs of human life?

36:53.583 --> 36:55.792
Inconclusive.

37:27.500 --> 37:28.583
Look at this.

37:28.625 --> 37:30.917
This is extraordinary.

37:32.917 --> 37:34.125
Those appear to be

37:34.166 --> 37:37.333
some kind of power

37:34.166 --> 37:37.333
waveguide conduits

37:37.375 --> 37:39.583
which allow them

37:37.375 --> 37:39.583
to work collectively

37:39.625 --> 37:41.417
as they perform

37:39.625 --> 37:41.417
ship functions.

37:41.458 --> 37:43.792
There's no way to take

37:41.458 --> 37:43.792
out enough of these

37:43.834 --> 37:45.041
to disable them.

37:45.083 --> 37:46.291
What if we

37:45.083 --> 37:46.291
look at this

37:46.333 --> 37:48.834
from the mosquito's

37:46.333 --> 37:48.834
point of view?

37:48.875 --> 37:50.667
Interesting metaphor, Doctor.

37:50.709 --> 37:52.208
What is your idea?

37:52.250 --> 37:55.000
If we sting them

37:52.250 --> 37:55.000
in a tender spot

37:55.041 --> 37:58.792
they might stop for

37:55.041 --> 37:58.792
a minute to scratch.

38:13.959 --> 38:16.041
Distribution

38:13.959 --> 38:16.041
nodes.

38:16.083 --> 38:19.750
SHELBY:

38:16.083 --> 38:19.750
If we take out a few of these,

38:16.083 --> 38:19.750
it just might make them scratch.

38:19.792 --> 38:21.667
The Captain's

38:19.792 --> 38:21.667
communicator--

38:21.709 --> 38:23.166
it is still activated.

38:23.208 --> 38:24.375
Crusher to Picard.

38:24.417 --> 38:25.583
Can you hear me?

38:25.625 --> 38:29.375
Can you locate it, Worf?

38:29.417 --> 38:31.041
This way.

38:34.709 --> 38:37.792
I strongly recommend redeploying

38:34.709 --> 38:37.792
all available defenses

38:37.834 --> 38:39.291
to protect Sector 001, Admiral.

38:39.333 --> 38:43.208
We're moving to intercept

38:39.333 --> 38:43.208
at Wolf 359.

38:43.250 --> 38:44.875
We'll make our stand there.

38:44.917 --> 38:47.250
How much longer can you

38:44.917 --> 38:47.250
maintain pursuit?

38:47.291 --> 38:49.875
22 minutes if they stay

38:47.291 --> 38:49.875
at their current speed.

38:49.917 --> 38:51.750
If we can't bring them

38:49.917 --> 38:51.750
out of warp

38:51.792 --> 38:53.917
we'll do as much damage

38:51.792 --> 38:53.917
as we can

38:53.959 --> 38:56.375
before we have to disengage.

38:56.417 --> 38:58.250
Picard?

38:59.375 --> 39:01.458
Nothing yet, sir.

39:02.333 --> 39:05.375
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

39:05.417 --> 39:08.083
(<i> beeping faster</i> )

39:08.125 --> 39:09.792
In here.

39:33.166 --> 39:34.959
Shelby to<i> Enterprise.</i>

39:35.000 --> 39:36.166
Go ahead.

39:36.208 --> 39:37.417
We've found

39:36.208 --> 39:37.417
the Captain's uniform

39:37.458 --> 39:38.709
and his communicator.

39:38.750 --> 39:41.291
We're resuming our search.

39:41.333 --> 39:43.166
Stand by, Commander.

39:43.208 --> 39:44.417
We're in business.

39:44.458 --> 39:46.375
It'll burn out

39:44.458 --> 39:46.375
the main deflector

39:46.417 --> 39:48.083
but it'll be one

39:46.417 --> 39:48.083
hell of a bang.

39:48.125 --> 39:49.208
Radiation danger?

39:49.250 --> 39:50.750
We're going to have

39:49.250 --> 39:50.750
to evacuate

39:50.792 --> 39:52.583
the entire forward half

39:50.792 --> 39:52.583
of the secondary hull

39:52.625 --> 39:54.000
and the lower three

39:52.625 --> 39:54.000
decks of the saucer.

39:54.041 --> 39:56.291
I'll see to that.

39:56.333 --> 39:58.000
Commander Shelby

39:58.041 --> 40:00.250
we have only 17 minutes

39:58.041 --> 40:00.250
of warp power left.

40:00.291 --> 40:03.083
Do whatever you can

40:00.291 --> 40:03.083
to get them out of warp.

40:03.125 --> 40:04.375
Acknowledged.

40:04.417 --> 40:06.291
Shelby out.

40:11.583 --> 40:13.500
Let's take out some

40:11.583 --> 40:13.500
of these distribution nodes

40:13.542 --> 40:15.667
and see what happens.

40:49.125 --> 40:50.667
Sir, they've done it.

40:50.709 --> 40:52.000
The Borg ship

40:50.709 --> 40:52.000
is dropping out of warp.

40:52.041 --> 40:54.125
Go to impulse.

40:54.166 --> 40:55.375
Aye, sir.

40:55.417 --> 40:57.709
Diverting warp power

40:55.417 --> 40:57.709
to main deflector.

40:57.750 --> 41:00.125
Move us to within

40:57.750 --> 41:00.125
40,000 kilometers

41:00.166 --> 41:01.500
and match velocity.

41:01.542 --> 41:03.000
Commence arming sequence.

41:03.041 --> 41:06.458
Increase deflector modulation

41:03.041 --> 41:06.458
to upper frequency band.

41:28.792 --> 41:30.000
Shelby to<i> Enterprise.</i>

41:30.041 --> 41:31.208
Encountering resistance.

41:31.250 --> 41:33.125
Prepare to beam us

41:31.250 --> 41:33.125
back on my signal.

41:50.709 --> 41:53.792
SHELBY:

41:50.709 --> 41:53.792
They're adapting

41:50.709 --> 41:53.792
to the frequencies.

41:57.166 --> 41:58.875
Jean-Luc.

42:04.917 --> 42:06.542
Captain!

42:06.583 --> 42:08.375
(<i> gasps</i> )

42:16.542 --> 42:18.667
(<i> grunts</i> )

42:18.709 --> 42:20.375
<i>Enterprise,</i> get us out of here.

42:38.875 --> 42:40.083
The Captain?

42:40.125 --> 42:42.208
We were unable to

42:40.125 --> 42:42.208
retrieve him, sir.

42:42.250 --> 42:44.291
The Captain has been

42:42.250 --> 42:44.291
altered by the Borg.

42:44.333 --> 42:45.458
Altered?

42:45.500 --> 42:49.000
He<i> is</i> a Borg.

42:49.041 --> 42:51.458
We'll go back.

42:49.041 --> 42:51.458
I need more people.

42:51.500 --> 42:52.792
We need to retune

42:51.500 --> 42:52.792
the phasers again.

42:52.834 --> 42:54.166
We'll get him

42:52.834 --> 42:54.166
out of there.

42:54.208 --> 42:55.709
LA FORGE:

42:54.208 --> 42:55.709
Commander.

42:55.750 --> 42:58.000
Reading subspace field

42:55.750 --> 42:58.000
fluctuations from within

42:58.041 --> 42:58.959
the Borg ship.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.083
Looks like

42:59.000 --> 43:00.083
they're...

43:00.125 --> 43:01.834
regenerating-- restoring power.

43:01.875 --> 43:04.208
They could be capable

43:01.875 --> 43:04.208
of warp any minute.

43:04.250 --> 43:06.166
Is the deflector ready?

43:06.208 --> 43:08.083
It's ready.

43:08.125 --> 43:11.291
Will, he's alive.

43:08.125 --> 43:11.291
If we could get him

43:08.125 --> 43:11.291
back to the ship

43:11.333 --> 43:13.583
I might be able

43:11.333 --> 43:13.583
to restore...

43:11.333 --> 43:13.583
This is our only chance

43:11.333 --> 43:13.583
to destroy them.

43:13.625 --> 43:16.709
If they get back into warp,

43:13.625 --> 43:16.709
our weapon is useless.

43:16.750 --> 43:18.750
We'll sabotage them again

43:16.750 --> 43:18.750
if we have to.

43:18.792 --> 43:20.458
We can't maintain power.

43:20.500 --> 43:22.583
We don't have the time.

43:20.500 --> 43:22.583
Prepare to fire.

43:22.625 --> 43:24.041
At least consult

43:22.625 --> 43:24.041
with Starfleet Command.

43:24.083 --> 43:25.834
Get Admiral Hanson

43:24.083 --> 43:25.834
on subspace.

43:25.875 --> 43:27.458
Belay that order, Lieutenant.

43:27.500 --> 43:28.542
There's no time.

43:29.667 --> 43:32.583
Sir, we are being hailed

43:29.667 --> 43:32.583
by the Borg.

43:33.625 --> 43:35.375
On screen.

43:52.625 --> 43:56.625
I am Locutus of Borg.

43:56.667 --> 44:00.083
Resistance is futile.

44:00.125 --> 44:06.291
Your life, as it has been,

44:00.125 --> 44:06.291
is over.

44:06.333 --> 44:08.625
From this time forward,

44:08.667 --> 44:13.375
you will service<i> us.</i>

44:23.375 --> 44:28.000
Mr. Worf... fire.
