AINE: [laughs]
Look at their T‐shirts.

00:04.240 --> 00:06.720
"Slag party."

00:06.720 --> 00:09.920
I wish you'd let me organize
you a slag party, Shona.

00:09.920 --> 00:12.040
‐ Every day is a slag party
to you.

00:12.040 --> 00:14.720
‐ [laughs]
Hey, ooh, good joke.

00:14.720 --> 00:16.600
Oh, come here.
Did you get something
for Vish's dad for us?

00:16.600 --> 00:18.680
‐ Did you see me get anything?
AINE: No.

00:18.680 --> 00:19.880
‐ Well, then.
‐ Right. Fine, we'll get him
something in the shop.

00:19.880 --> 00:21.400
‐ Course I got him something.

00:21.400 --> 00:23.880
And I got a card,
and I signed it from everyone.

00:23.880 --> 00:25.680
God, I'm all nervy.

00:25.680 --> 00:27.560
‐ Why? You said you didn't care
if Mam met them or not.

00:27.560 --> 00:29.080
‐ Not about Mammy
meeting Vish's family,

00:29.080 --> 00:30.680
about you and Ma.

00:30.680 --> 00:32.320
You haven't talked to her
in months.

00:32.320 --> 00:33.800
You haven't‐‐
‐ Oh, Shona, don't.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.120
‐ No.
Come on, she's old.

00:35.120 --> 00:37.120
You have to forgive her,
and move on.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.680
‐ She's only old
when she wants to be.

00:38.680 --> 00:40.080
‐ What if she died
and you hadn't forgiven her?

00:40.080 --> 00:42.240
‐ Mammy won't die.
She's too stubborn.

00:42.240 --> 00:44.400
‐ I can't believe I even
said that about Mammy dying.
Jesus Christ.

00:44.400 --> 00:45.640
‐ The problem is,
we're just too different,

00:45.640 --> 00:47.200
and we'll probably never
get along.

00:47.200 --> 00:49.680
‐ You'll never get along?
You always got along.

00:49.680 --> 00:51.840
‐ Look, Shona, they've gone.
Free slag mags.

00:51.840 --> 00:54.200
SHONA: [stammers, sighs]
Grab me one.

00:54.200 --> 00:55.680
No, I'll tell you what
the problem is, the problem is

00:55.680 --> 00:57.480
that I'm stuck in the middle
of this bullshit,

00:57.480 --> 00:59.240
and it's not fair.

00:59.240 --> 01:01.080
‐ Hey, Sho.
Sho, look at this.

01:01.080 --> 01:03.640
[English accent]
We will fight them
on the beaches.

01:03.640 --> 01:06.640
[mumbles] We will fight 'em
on the grass

01:06.640 --> 01:08.520
and then we'll come back
to the‐‐

01:08.520 --> 01:10.720
to the beaches
for more beach fighting...

01:10.720 --> 01:13.400
[laughs]

01:13.400 --> 01:15.640
‐ My babies.
‐ What happened to your leg?

01:15.640 --> 01:17.160
‐ Oh, my God,
what happened to you?

01:17.160 --> 01:19.520
‐ Don't point it out,
or people will notice.

01:19.520 --> 01:21.080
It's grand.
AINE: Why do you have a cane?

01:21.080 --> 01:23.240
You look mad.
‐ No, it's not a cane.

01:23.240 --> 01:26.120
I only have it in case
my sports injury
starts playing up.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.640
‐ Thank God.

01:28.920 --> 01:31.440
EILEEN: [chuckles]
God, your hair's got so long.

01:31.440 --> 01:34.320
You look like your father
in the '70s.

01:34.320 --> 01:36.120
‐ Right, so I look like
a dead man? Thanks.

01:36.120 --> 01:39.560
‐ Hey, who's this?

01:39.560 --> 01:40.760
[laughs]

01:40.760 --> 01:43.440
It's Uncle Terry.
‐ [laughs]

01:43.440 --> 01:46.160
‐ Mammy, stop now.
There's no time for silliness.

01:46.160 --> 01:47.640
It's a big day for Shona.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.600
‐ Oh, Mam.
‐ We'll be late for our train.

01:49.600 --> 01:51.040
Oh, come on.
‐ Right.

01:52.320 --> 01:55.120
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

01:55.120 --> 01:56.720
AINE: What's in this, Mammy?
Jesus.

01:56.720 --> 01:58.200
EILEEN: Just a few bricks,

01:58.200 --> 02:00.520
a little bit of gold bullion,
and me knickers.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.560
SHONA: Do you know what,
it's a bit of a way off still.

02:02.560 --> 02:04.400
Shall we get a taxi?
AINE: Yes, please.

02:04.400 --> 02:07.280
‐ Shona, don't be gentle
with me, like I'm an auld one.

02:07.280 --> 02:08.960
It's just my hamstring.
I'm fine.

02:08.960 --> 02:10.160
‐ We can put you
in a wheelchair, Mammy,

02:10.160 --> 02:12.000
and just roll you
down the hill.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.920
Do you know who you're like?
[laughs]

02:13.920 --> 02:15.880
You're like Willy Wonka
at the start of‐‐
‐ I'm Willy Wonka.

02:15.880 --> 02:17.560
‐ No, Mammy,
let me finish my sentence.

02:17.560 --> 02:19.440
<i>And the Chocolate Factory.</i>
‐ I wasn't interrupting.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.160
That's how conversations work.
‐ It's rude.

02:21.160 --> 02:24.040
‐ And anyway, the film
is called <i>Willy Wonka,</i>

02:24.040 --> 02:27.200
but the book is called <i>Charlie</i>
<i>and the Chocolate Factory.</i>

02:27.200 --> 02:28.880
‐ You used to read me that.
You remember?
‐ What?

02:28.880 --> 02:29.920
No, it's not called that.
It's the opposite way around.

02:29.920 --> 02:31.360
‐ Now!
‐ What?

02:31.360 --> 02:32.680
‐ How come you're allowed
to interrupt Shona

02:32.680 --> 02:34.000
but I'm not allowed
to interrupt you?

02:34.000 --> 02:35.280
‐ Oh, because, Mammy,
that's different

02:35.280 --> 02:37.480
than interrupting a joke,
obviously.

02:37.480 --> 02:38.800
You let someone get
to the end of their‐‐
‐ Oh. Oh, I beg your pardon.

02:38.800 --> 02:40.760
That was a joke, was it?
‐ Yes, it was.

02:40.760 --> 02:42.080
And it would have made Shona
laugh if you'd given me
a chance.

02:42.080 --> 02:43.960
SHONA:
Come on, the pair of youse.

02:43.960 --> 02:45.400
‐ Oh, God.

02:46.440 --> 02:47.800
Oh, wait.

02:47.800 --> 02:50.520
Richard, the French boy's
dad'll love this.

02:50.520 --> 02:52.240
‐ What are you doing?

02:52.240 --> 02:54.320
‐ Oh, I'm just taking a picture
of these coffee pods.

02:54.320 --> 02:56.080
It'll be funny.
[camera clicks]

02:56.080 --> 02:57.240
He says that people
are recycling them,

02:57.240 --> 02:58.400
but no one ever does.

02:58.400 --> 03:00.240
‐ Who's Richard?

03:00.240 --> 03:03.000
You never told me
there was a man on the go.
‐ Oh, Mammy.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.960
‐ Well, Mammy, Richard
is Aine's elderly lover.

03:06.960 --> 03:08.600
‐ Oh, stop. Shona‐‐
‐ Elderly lover?

03:08.600 --> 03:10.640
‐ He's the same age as Shona.

03:10.640 --> 03:13.640
‐ Hey, do you think he might
want a go on the mother too?
‐ Ugh!

03:13.640 --> 03:15.840
‐ I mean‐‐well,
when I put my cane down,

03:15.840 --> 03:17.040
I could give it a good go.

03:17.040 --> 03:19.080
‐ Blech! That's disgusting.

03:20.840 --> 03:22.040
‐ Hey, girls.

03:23.440 --> 03:24.920
‐ What are you doing?
‐ Hold on, Mammy.

03:24.920 --> 03:27.760
‐ Get off. Get off.
It was a joke.

03:27.760 --> 03:29.080
I was being Willy Wonka.

03:29.080 --> 03:30.600
SHONA: Well, you know,
it's a joke

03:30.600 --> 03:32.320
if you actually know how to do
the forward flip.

03:32.320 --> 03:33.600
EILEEN: Yeah, well,
you've no sense of humor.

03:33.600 --> 03:35.160
SHONA: [sighs]
It's dangerous.

03:35.160 --> 03:36.680
‐ I would have laughed so hard
if it backfired

03:36.680 --> 03:37.800
and you fell
right on your face.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.000
EILEEN: Yeah.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.880
‐ And anyways, Mammy,
that's not how you do a fall.

03:41.880 --> 03:43.480
It's all in the feet.
This is how you do a fall.

03:43.480 --> 03:46.320
Like...
[groans]

03:46.320 --> 03:47.960
Like that.
EILEEN: That was really fake.

03:47.960 --> 03:49.200
‐ Wasn't.
‐ I knew you were going to
do that.

03:49.200 --> 03:51.200
‐ Yeah, you knew
I was gonna do it,

03:51.200 --> 03:52.680
because I told you in advance
I was gonna do it.
‐ Oh, yeah.

03:52.680 --> 03:54.000
‐ That's how you knew.
‐ Answer for everything.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.120
All right,
show me a backflip now.

03:56.120 --> 03:57.480
AINE: Well, I watched
a YouTube clip on it,
so don't be sarcastic.

03:57.480 --> 03:58.960
EILEEN:
Do you do any trapeze work?

03:58.960 --> 04:00.520
AINE: Oh, for God's sake.
SHONA: Let's get a taxi.

04:00.520 --> 04:01.760
Seriously, let's just‐‐
let's just get a taxi.

04:01.760 --> 04:03.080
AINE: No, honestly...

04:03.080 --> 04:05.000
SHONA:
And don't talk about curry,

04:05.000 --> 04:06.480
or Bollywood.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.040
EILEEN: I could have worked
in Bollywood.

04:08.040 --> 04:11.000
I went for a casting
for a music video

04:11.000 --> 04:12.240
they made in Dublin once.

04:12.240 --> 04:13.320
‐ Oh.
‐ Who are "they"?

04:13.320 --> 04:14.560
All the Bollywoods?

04:14.560 --> 04:16.600
Paul Bollywood and his friends?

04:16.600 --> 04:18.560

an Indian gentleman

we interviewed one time
for <i>Nationwide Country.</i>

EILEEN: Lovely man.
Lived in Meath.

I‐I don't know why, just‐‐
just don't.

04:28.480 --> 04:29.800
[sighs]

04:29.800 --> 04:31.520
And don't talk about marriage,
or‐‐

04:31.520 --> 04:33.560

‐ I was talking to you.

04:49.560 --> 04:51.360
‐ That's for you
from all of us.
‐ Thank you.

04:51.360 --> 04:53.160
Today's not about me.
I don't want to make a fuss.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.240
KAVITA: Yes, come this way.
Come this way.

04:54.240 --> 04:55.360
HARI: Oh, there she is.

04:55.360 --> 04:56.760
KAVITA: Would you like a drink?

04:56.760 --> 04:58.240

the big star.

04:58.240 --> 04:59.600
‐ Oh, no.
[chuckles]

04:59.600 --> 05:02.280
No, just treat me
like a normal person.

05:02.280 --> 05:03.640
KAVITA:
Anil, go get the canapés.

05:03.640 --> 05:05.040
‐ Yes, I'm going. I'm going.

05:05.040 --> 05:07.640
EILEEN: Thank you.
Lovely house you've got.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.200
ANIL: Hi, Eileen.

05:09.200 --> 05:10.760
I am the slave boy today,
and I don't get to eat,

05:10.760 --> 05:12.840
never mind that
I'm on a zero hours contract.

05:12.840 --> 05:15.800
Thank you, Mother.
But, er, would you like
one of these canapés?

05:15.800 --> 05:17.400
‐ Just tell me,
what's in this one?

05:17.400 --> 05:18.600
SHONA: Mam!

05:18.600 --> 05:20.360
They're grand.
You'll like them.

05:20.360 --> 05:21.720
‐ I was only asking.

05:21.720 --> 05:23.440
SEEMA:
Nothing is too spicy, Eileen.

05:23.440 --> 05:26.200
We learned our lesson from
the last time Aine was here.

05:26.200 --> 05:29.040
‐ Oh, no. Now, can I just say,
it wasn't too spicy for me.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.480
Something just got stuck
in my neck.

05:30.480 --> 05:32.480
‐ Spice.
EILEEN: She is very sensitive.

05:32.480 --> 05:33.760
‐ No, darling,
don't drop the plate.

05:33.760 --> 05:34.800
BUB:
Can I have something to eat?

05:38.600 --> 05:40.680
AINE:
I mean, I can handle the spice.

05:40.680 --> 05:43.160
‐ This is demeaning
on literally so many levels.

05:43.160 --> 05:45.040
‐ Anil,
if you got a proper job,

05:45.040 --> 05:47.840
then you could have a spot
at the big boys' table.

05:47.840 --> 05:49.680
‐ I have a proper job
at BuzzFeed.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.640
‐ Oh. Bubs, you know what,

05:51.640 --> 05:53.400
if you go to school
and study hard,

05:53.400 --> 05:55.360
you could have a job
at BuzzFeed.

05:55.360 --> 05:56.960
‐ Or, Bubs, you can do
what Uncle Vish did

05:56.960 --> 05:58.400
and move to New York
for two minutes

05:58.400 --> 06:00.400
and come back and sound like
a shit radio DJ.

06:00.400 --> 06:02.960
‐ Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
radio DJ?

06:02.960 --> 06:04.080
Wait, it was 12 years.

06:04.080 --> 06:05.400
It wasn't two minutes.

06:05.400 --> 06:07.000
SEEMA: Happy birthday to you,
Dad.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.280
To Hari.

06:08.280 --> 06:10.120
‐ Happy birthday.
ALL: To Hari!

06:10.120 --> 06:12.200
‐ Please, don't make a fuss,
eh?

06:12.200 --> 06:14.440
SEEMA: Ah, you'll make him cry.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.040
‐ All right, everyone,
listen up.

06:16.040 --> 06:17.520
‐ Shh.

06:17.520 --> 06:19.320
‐ I just want to say
how wonderful it is

06:19.320 --> 06:20.720
to have you here with us today.

06:20.720 --> 06:22.280
And to celebrate,

06:22.280 --> 06:25.400
we have prepared
a special dish for Aine.

06:25.400 --> 06:27.000
‐ Oh, what?

06:27.000 --> 06:28.560
Oh, that's so nice.
SHONA: That's so sweet.

06:28.560 --> 06:29.680
KAVITA: Ta‐da!

06:29.680 --> 06:31.000
[laughter]

06:31.000 --> 06:32.880
SHONA: Burn, burn, burn.
AINE: Very funny.

06:32.880 --> 06:34.240
Oh, my God, thank you so much.

06:34.240 --> 06:35.480
Is this all the way
from Kerala?

06:35.480 --> 06:37.000
[camera clicking]

06:37.000 --> 06:38.960
No, it's too spicy.
I can't.

06:38.960 --> 06:40.880
‐ Would you like some yogurt
with that, then?

06:40.880 --> 06:42.280
‐ Yeah, can I get some yogurt,
please?

06:42.280 --> 06:43.920
Thank you.

06:43.920 --> 06:45.600
‐ What are you up to
right now, Sho?

06:45.600 --> 06:47.400
‐ Oh, I haven't told you
about Sho's new thing?

06:47.400 --> 06:48.760
Oh, you're gonna love this,
as a woman.

06:48.760 --> 06:50.840
‐ As a woman
who also has a job.

06:50.840 --> 06:53.560
SHONA: Yes!
Listen up, working woman.

06:53.560 --> 06:55.840
‐ Yeah, I know, right?
VISH: No, it is very good.

06:55.840 --> 06:58.200
Sho is doing this, er,
networking thing

06:58.200 --> 06:59.560

06:59.560 --> 07:01.640

07:01.640 --> 07:02.960

07:02.960 --> 07:04.520
No, it's a big old project,
actually.

07:04.520 --> 07:06.160
I'm‐‐I'm setting it up
with this amazing woman

07:06.160 --> 07:07.800

doing most of the work.

That's amazing.

07:12.280 --> 07:14.880
‐ Is it a big job, Shona?
‐ Mm, yeah.

07:14.880 --> 07:16.360
I mean, it's small right now,
but hopefully,

07:16.360 --> 07:18.200
over the next couple of years,
yeah, yeah.

07:18.200 --> 07:20.640
‐ That'll be hard, then, with
the children, then, won't it?

07:20.640 --> 07:22.320
SEEMA: Mum.
KAVITA: Oh, what?

07:22.320 --> 07:25.520
Time must be a pressure
at this stage.

07:25.520 --> 07:28.080
‐ Oh, yes, none of us
getting any younger, Kavita.

07:28.080 --> 07:31.200
‐ Well, Shona doesn't have time
for kids 'cause she's got me.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.760
VISH: Ain't that the truth.

07:32.760 --> 07:34.440
EILEEN: Yeah, well,
you definitely have become

07:34.440 --> 07:37.000
a full‐time job this last year.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.600
SEEMA: What was last year?

07:39.880 --> 07:41.480
‐ Er, she broke her leg.

07:41.480 --> 07:42.960
SEEMA: Oh, no.
How'd you do that?
‐ Yeah.

07:42.960 --> 07:45.760
EILEEN: No, no, it's all
fixed now. She's fine.

07:45.760 --> 07:47.800
SEEMA: That's bad luck
that you both have bad legs.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.520
‐ Yeah, well, that's where
the similarity ends, eh, Mam?

07:50.520 --> 07:54.960
‐ Actually, I once auditioned
for the film <i>My Left Foot.</i>

07:54.960 --> 07:56.600
‐ Wow, no way! Really?
[camera clicking]

07:56.600 --> 07:58.240

the right foot?

07:58.240 --> 08:00.040
‐ No.

08:00.040 --> 08:02.200
For a neighbor who comes in.

08:02.200 --> 08:03.440
‐ Ah. Oh, the neighbor.

08:03.440 --> 08:04.520
I think I saw that bit.
‐ Wow.

08:04.520 --> 08:06.120
That's really cool, actually.

08:06.120 --> 08:07.760
‐ Wait, she didn't get
the part, lads. Chill out.

08:07.760 --> 08:09.240
‐ I actually don't want kids.

08:11.720 --> 08:13.080
[laughs]

08:14.720 --> 08:17.080
‐ Ah, well, you always think
you don't want kids,

08:17.080 --> 08:18.120
and then you change your mind.

08:18.120 --> 08:19.560
I mean...
‐ Yes.

08:19.560 --> 08:21.840
‐ I still sometimes think
I don't want Aine.

08:21.840 --> 08:24.640

08:24.640 --> 08:25.800
‐ Yeah, but I genuinely‐‐

08:25.800 --> 08:27.280
I genuinely don't.

08:27.280 --> 08:29.280
You know, it's not a big deal.
Just never have.

08:34.240 --> 08:35.920
‐ Do you know what, lads?

08:35.920 --> 08:37.760
I'm going to throw caution
to the wind

08:37.760 --> 08:39.560
and eat with my hand.

08:39.560 --> 08:41.560
‐ Go for it.
‐ Well, all right.

08:41.560 --> 08:44.520
‐ Yeah. So, fork‐off forks.

08:44.520 --> 08:46.160
Now, um...

08:46.160 --> 08:47.960
‐ What about you and children,
Vish?

08:47.960 --> 08:49.640
‐ Oh, um...

08:49.640 --> 08:52.280
I want what Shona wants.
‐ Oh, okay.

08:52.280 --> 08:54.120
‐ What are you going to do
when you're our age, then, huh?

08:54.120 --> 08:55.760
Who's going to look after you
in the care home?

08:55.760 --> 08:57.440
‐ Thought you wanted kids,
Vish?

08:57.440 --> 08:59.320
‐ No.

08:59.320 --> 09:02.920
I, er‐‐I have Bubs right here,
and she is all I need.

09:02.920 --> 09:05.440
And then give her back to you
when I'm done, so...

09:05.440 --> 09:07.520
‐ Oh, you never know real love
until you have children.

09:07.520 --> 09:08.720
KAVITA: True.
‐ Mam.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.520
‐ Even if Anil murdered
someone,

09:10.520 --> 09:12.160
I'd still love him
unconditionally.
You know, I mean...

09:12.160 --> 09:14.280
‐ And get a spade to help
dig a grave and cover it up.

09:14.280 --> 09:16.160
KAVITA: Yeah.
‐ Why am I a murderer?

09:16.160 --> 09:17.880
‐ Er, Vish would never
be stupid enough
to murder someone.

09:17.880 --> 09:19.800
‐ Yeah, I would hire a guy.
BUB: [laughing]

09:19.800 --> 09:21.920
‐ Let me take her back.
VISH: No, she's fine.
I got her.

09:21.920 --> 09:23.760
‐ I don't think you need
to be a mother, though...

09:23.760 --> 09:26.120
you know, to‐‐to know
unconditional love.

09:26.120 --> 09:28.840
‐ Right.
‐ Don't think that's‐‐
that's a thing.

09:28.840 --> 09:30.800
Also, I have enough money
to hire someone

09:30.800 --> 09:32.880
to come visit me if I ever
end up in a care home, so...

09:32.880 --> 09:35.400

09:36.360 --> 09:38.640
‐ True, that.

09:38.640 --> 09:40.480
HARI: Can I get
the mango chutney, please?

09:40.480 --> 09:41.880
