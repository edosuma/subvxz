00:16.516 --> 00:19.019
- Yes, this is President Bush.
- Reagan's not there?

00:19.102 --> 00:22.313
No, President Reagan
isn't president anymore. I succeeded him.

00:22.397 --> 00:23.648
- Thanks.
- All right.

00:23.732 --> 00:25.775
- Have a good day.
- You, too. Bye-bye.

00:26.609 --> 00:28.778
Come on in.

00:28.862 --> 00:31.531
Mr. President, we received this
in the mail this morning.

00:31.614 --> 00:32.907
It's a video cassette, sir.

00:32.991 --> 00:35.535
- Who sent it?
- Mr. Bojangles, sir.

00:36.953 --> 00:39.247
- Mr. Bojangles?
- Yes, Mr. President.

00:39.330 --> 00:40.970
And he insisted you watch it immediately.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.543
Well, put it in! Put it in!

00:55.305 --> 00:56.931
Mm-mmm-mmm.

01:00.477 --> 01:04.438
All right, you got some chubby Bubba
blowin' a tuba. What's the point?

01:04.522 --> 01:07.275
Mr. Bojangles says he'll explain
everything when you arrive, sir.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.695
- Arrive where?
- The limousine is waiting outside, sir.

01:11.321 --> 01:13.907
- Mr. Bojangles says it's urgent.
- Oh, God.

01:13.990 --> 01:16.159
Oh, God, I'm gonna boot.

01:18.161 --> 01:21.247
President Bush has landed.
Repeat, President Bush has landed.

01:22.499 --> 01:24.292
President Bush is in the compound.

01:28.546 --> 01:30.548
Is Mr. Bojangles here?

01:34.886 --> 01:37.889
- Hey, George.
- Hello, Ex-President Reagan.

01:38.807 --> 01:41.559
You know, George,
chopping wood is an art form.

01:42.602 --> 01:45.104
Hit the log in the right spot
and it cracks open,

01:45.188 --> 01:47.232
like dry human bones on a hot summer day.

01:54.906 --> 01:55.990
There you go.

01:56.074 --> 01:58.368
- Look at us, everybody! Look!
- Hey!

01:58.451 --> 02:02.914
- We made T-shirts for everyone!
- No, she made T-shirts. I paid for them.

02:04.165 --> 02:05.834
Blah, blah, blah. Anyone can make money.

02:05.917 --> 02:08.711
But not everyone can come up
with killer sex puns about campfires.

02:08.794 --> 02:09.854
Ooh!

02:09.878 --> 02:13.842
- J.J.
- No fucking way!

02:13.925 --> 02:15.718
- Abby.
- I'm gonna Flashdance it.

02:15.802 --> 02:18.346
I have Andy's shirt here.
Does anyone know if he's coming?

02:18.429 --> 02:20.682
Last time I saw Andy was in '82.

02:20.765 --> 02:23.184
I wrote him a ton of postcards,
and he never wrote me back.

02:24.185 --> 02:25.186
Whoo!

02:25.270 --> 02:27.147
Yeah, I heard
he, like, peaked in high school.

02:27.230 --> 02:30.316
Like, dropped out of community college
and was working at the Burger Doink.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.235
Yeah!

02:32.318 --> 02:34.195
He called me once but then hung up.

02:34.279 --> 02:36.698
- How'd you know it was him?
- Star 69.

02:36.781 --> 02:39.409
- He was the hottest guy in camp.
- And a major league douche.

02:39.492 --> 02:41.202
Takes one to know one.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.538
Ah-boom-boom-boom, hey-yah!

02:44.706 --> 02:45.706
Hey, guys!

02:46.124 --> 02:47.458
- Beth!
- What's up?

02:47.542 --> 02:49.544
- You having fun?
- Yeah!

02:49.627 --> 02:52.064
I guess you're wondering why I invited you
back to camp this weekend.

02:52.088 --> 02:54.799
You didn't invite us.
We made this plan ourselves ten years ago.

02:54.883 --> 02:56.175
Okay, you win.

02:56.259 --> 02:59.053
I'll stop pretending everything's fine
and I'll tell you what it is.

03:01.097 --> 03:03.474
- I'm selling the camp.
- What?

03:06.436 --> 03:07.270
I'm sorry, I have to go.

03:07.353 --> 03:11.316
I have to help the kids make dragon boats
with dry pasta and pipe cleaners.

03:14.235 --> 03:16.237
It's okay, honey.
It's okay. It's okay.

03:16.321 --> 03:18.907
- Is she talking about this camp?
- This camp.

03:18.990 --> 03:20.241
Oh, my God.

03:27.665 --> 03:30.585
The foliage really is beautiful
this time of year.

03:31.252 --> 03:33.546
The honeysuckles are in full bloom.

03:33.630 --> 03:36.716
Yeah, it seems like fall could be coming
a little early.

03:36.799 --> 03:39.135
Yeah, it does seem like that. It does.

03:41.804 --> 03:47.143
I still can't believe that you're a VP
of marketing at a major cosmetics company

03:47.227 --> 03:48.353
at 26 years old.

03:48.436 --> 03:50.188
Katie, that is so impressive.

03:50.271 --> 03:53.024
I don't know.
It seems like all I do is work.

03:53.107 --> 03:54.776
It's like I've forgotten how to have fun.

03:56.027 --> 03:57.445
This is fun.

03:59.030 --> 04:01.366
Yeah, this is fun.

04:02.116 --> 04:03.576
This is really fun.

04:03.660 --> 04:04.911
Oh, wait!

04:05.536 --> 04:06.913
Let me help you.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.930
- Camp is great, huh?
- Mm.

04:24.013 --> 04:26.349
I wish I had somewhere to go to like this
where I grew up.

04:26.432 --> 04:29.269
- Where are you from?
- Oh, I don't like to talk about myself.

04:29.769 --> 04:32.647
Why don't you let me push that stroller?
I mean, that's why I'm here!

04:32.730 --> 04:34.650
You're supposed to be relaxing
with your friends.

04:34.691 --> 04:36.901
No, no, no. There's a certain way
she likes to be pushed

04:36.985 --> 04:38.778
and I'm the only one
who knows how to do it.

04:38.861 --> 04:39.862
It's like this.

04:42.073 --> 04:43.324
I understand.

04:43.408 --> 04:45.702
Every parent has different ways
they like things done.

04:45.785 --> 04:48.204
But I think you and Ben
are doing a really great job.

04:48.871 --> 04:50.498
Really? You think so?

04:50.581 --> 04:52.041
Oh, yeah, you're great parents.

04:52.125 --> 04:56.129
And little Ashley is just so beautiful,
just adorable.

04:56.963 --> 04:59.090
- You're like the perfect little family.
- Oh!

05:11.060 --> 05:13.980
So, you and Mark spend
a lot of time with J.J., huh?

05:14.147 --> 05:17.525
Well, yeah, you know, like,
Mark works 70 hours a week at Lehman,

05:17.608 --> 05:22.780
and I'm in between jobs right now,
a.k.a. being a total "slacker."

05:23.698 --> 05:25.384
Like that movie
that came out five weeks ago.

05:25.408 --> 05:26.743
- Yes.
- Exactly.

05:26.826 --> 05:29.162
It sounds like you and J.J.
should be in a relationship.

05:29.245 --> 05:30.245
I mean, look at him.

05:30.288 --> 05:33.416
I bet he's really wild in the sack.

05:33.499 --> 05:34.499
I don't know.

05:34.542 --> 05:36.854
Sometimes I feel like
I make J.J. hang out with me so much,

05:36.878 --> 05:39.088
he doesn't have time
for a real girlfriend of his own.

05:40.757 --> 05:43.134
Now let's switch
to your story line, Susie.

05:43.217 --> 05:48.306
- Give us the 411 on Garth MacArthur.
- Yeah! British guys are so hot.

05:48.389 --> 05:50.229
We're just making a movie together.
That's all!

05:50.308 --> 05:53.019
Liar, liar, pants on fire!
Hang your pants from a telephone wire!

05:53.102 --> 05:55.748
Fine! If you guys want the dirty daily,
I'll give you the dirty daily.

05:55.772 --> 05:58.983
- We've been pitching woo. Satisfied?
- I knew it. I knew it.

05:59.067 --> 06:00.234
Tell us everything.

06:00.318 --> 06:02.987
Okay. I want to start with his dick,
right here and right now.

06:03.071 --> 06:05.281
I want circumference, ball weight,
and girth.

06:05.364 --> 06:08.201
Look, he is an actor in my film,
and this is show business.

06:08.284 --> 06:09.724
Mixed with a little monkey business.

06:10.745 --> 06:12.905
The most important thing is
it's none of your business.

06:13.081 --> 06:15.708
You just used the word "business"
about three different ways.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.960
With these actor types,
you have to be careful.

06:18.044 --> 06:23.049
We're having sex and that's great,
but it's not like I'm gonna fall in love.

06:23.132 --> 06:25.176
I'm not that naive.

06:25.259 --> 06:26.677
He is cute though, isn't he?

06:27.553 --> 06:28.721
Ah!

06:29.138 --> 06:30.389
Ah!

06:32.725 --> 06:34.036
Okay. So, be honest with us, Garth.

06:34.060 --> 06:37.355
Who is, like, the hottest famous chick
you've bumped uglies with?

06:37.438 --> 06:39.690
Kelly LeBrock? Sherilyn Fenn?

06:39.774 --> 06:41.901
I don't get caught up
in all that celebrity hogwash.

06:41.984 --> 06:44.320
Oh, come on, man. It's just us guys here.

06:44.403 --> 06:45.738
Listen, I'll tell you the details

06:45.822 --> 06:48.300
about the intern I did a dump truck with
in my office last week,

06:48.324 --> 06:50.660
but I know it's not gonna be
as juicy as what you got.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.161
Wait. Is that true?

06:53.162 --> 06:55.265
I thought you were with
that gal over yonder chatting with Susie.

06:55.289 --> 06:58.292
- Claire, is it?
- Yeah, Claire.

06:58.376 --> 07:01.838
She's been my girlfriend forever.
That's us on that tree right there.

07:02.213 --> 07:05.049
We carved that back
on the last day of '81.

07:06.634 --> 07:07.635
Oh!

07:09.303 --> 07:10.303
Hey, guys!

07:11.848 --> 07:12.848
Hey, guys.

07:13.474 --> 07:14.851
How was Waterville?

07:14.934 --> 07:15.977
It was really fun.

07:16.060 --> 07:18.688
It's always fun to get away from camp.
Even for an hour.

07:18.771 --> 07:20.982
Totally.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.193
Look, I've been begging her
to move in with me.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.486
I want to get married.

07:25.570 --> 07:27.881
But if she's not willing
to make a commitment, why should I be?

07:27.905 --> 07:29.591
Oh, I don't know, mate.

07:29.615 --> 07:32.618
Seems like this is between you and Claire.
I'm staying out of it.

07:32.702 --> 07:35.264
You should see some of these girls
that are at my office.

07:35.288 --> 07:40.751
Fresh out of B-school,
eager to please and make an impression.

07:40.835 --> 07:44.297
Why didn't you tell me about all this
extracurricular activity until now?

07:45.631 --> 07:49.385
Honestly, mate, I don't date actresses.
They're all fucking mental.

07:50.219 --> 07:52.847
That's why I love Susie so much, you know?
She's different.

07:53.431 --> 07:56.684
I just wish she was as serious about me
as I am about her.

07:56.767 --> 07:58.269
If only she saw it that way.

08:03.608 --> 08:07.987
Hey, man, um, you're not gonna
say anything to Claire about this, right?

08:09.322 --> 08:11.365
- No, sure.
- Cool. Cool.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.595
Just 'cause I might yank out my pilgrim

08:14.619 --> 08:16.996
to carve the old Thanksgiving turkey
every once in a while,

08:17.079 --> 08:19.207
I still love Claire. You know that, right?

08:19.290 --> 08:22.793
- Yeah, no. I totally, totally get that.
- Okay, cool.

08:23.794 --> 08:25.588
'Cause, I mean, sure, yeah, you know, yes,

08:25.671 --> 08:27.965
I might take my goblin out
trick-or-treating on Halloween,

08:28.049 --> 08:30.051
dip into that candy corn a little early,

08:30.134 --> 08:33.304
but that doesn't mean that Claire isn't
still the caramel apple of my eye.

08:33.386 --> 08:37.183
- Yeah, totally. I get it. Man, I get it.
- Okay, cool. Cool. Glad we're good.

08:37.265 --> 08:39.101
'Cause I'm just saying, on Fourth of July,

08:39.184 --> 08:42.270
I might whip out my bottle rocket
and do the Uncle Sam dance.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.315
Mark, I get it!

08:44.398 --> 08:47.068
You fuck women who aren't Claire.
I get it.

08:47.818 --> 08:49.612
Okay, maybe lighten up, dude.

08:49.695 --> 08:51.656
Andy?

08:55.243 --> 08:56.369
Is that...

09:03.793 --> 09:06.045
Son of a gun! It's Andy!

09:06.128 --> 09:08.714
- Hey, Andy! Over here!
- Andy!

09:08.798 --> 09:11.467
- Andy!
- Oh! He's doing donuts!

09:11.551 --> 09:14.554
Yeah, boy! Get them donuts!

09:15.137 --> 09:18.349
- He's doing donuts! Andy's doing donuts!
- Andy's doing donuts!

09:19.100 --> 09:21.352
"I wish Andy would take a bite of me."

09:21.435 --> 09:23.854
"I know.
I wish Andy would take a bite of me, too."

09:23.938 --> 09:25.648
Well, you're both in luck, donuts.

09:26.857 --> 09:29.694
I always love
when Andy does the donut routine.

09:29.777 --> 09:32.196
Andy doing donuts
just like the good old days!

09:35.491 --> 09:37.285
One of you fleens grab my stuff.

09:38.119 --> 09:40.037
I gotta take a monster dump.

09:41.289 --> 09:43.583
Where's Katie?
Tell her I want to fuck her.

09:44.292 --> 09:45.668
Son of a gun!

09:45.751 --> 09:47.837
'Cause single people like
moo shu pork, right?

09:47.920 --> 09:50.673
- I guess.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!

09:50.756 --> 09:52.236
What do you think you're doing there?

09:53.301 --> 09:55.511
- What?
- That's the spirit of Camp Firewood.

09:55.595 --> 09:59.015
You can't just walk right past it.
It's, like, totally sacrilegious.

09:59.473 --> 10:03.019
Oh, my God!
You are not serious right now.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.479
I am. Stop. I absolutely am serious.

10:05.563 --> 10:09.108
- We must respect the spirit.
- Oh, come on, Coop.

10:09.191 --> 10:11.319
You know that's just
some stupid lawn sculpture

10:11.402 --> 10:13.321
that Mitch bought
in a flea market in Skowhegan.

10:13.404 --> 10:16.949
Well, I just would not mess around
with any of this supernatural stuff.

10:23.748 --> 10:28.377
I'm sorry, Spirit of Camp Firewood.
I didn't mean any disrespect.

10:29.670 --> 10:32.048
Spirit says he'll let it slide this time.

10:32.131 --> 10:34.300
Oh! It's a he.

10:35.092 --> 10:36.427
It could be a she.

10:38.929 --> 10:43.309
We're at that moment in the morning
when breakfast is just a fading memory

10:43.392 --> 10:45.811
and lunch is looming, folks.

10:45.895 --> 10:48.981
And if you're not out there yet,
get your booty in motion.

10:49.065 --> 10:52.026
The big softball game is underway.

10:52.109 --> 10:54.487
Deegs! Deegs! Deegs!

11:06.624 --> 11:08.959
- He's like Andy but for today.
- Yes!

11:09.794 --> 11:12.755
Hey, kid, who is that?

11:14.173 --> 11:17.009
Oh, that's Jeremy Deegenstein,
but everybody calls him Deegs.

11:17.093 --> 11:19.095
- Deegs?
- Yeah, Deegs.

11:19.178 --> 11:21.939
He's, like, the coolest guy at camp.

11:26.227 --> 11:30.398
Your nanny seems really great, McKinley.
All the guys are drooling.

11:30.481 --> 11:31.524
Yeah.

11:33.859 --> 11:36.028
Do you feel like
there's something off about her?

11:36.112 --> 11:38.739
I do. I just... I can't...
I can't put my finger on it.

11:38.823 --> 11:41.343
Well, you know, the hot nanny always
turns out to be a psycho killer.

11:41.367 --> 11:42.201
You know that, right?

11:42.284 --> 11:45.246
Here we go, batter! Swing, batter!

11:45.329 --> 11:46.163
Wait, what do you mean?

11:46.247 --> 11:48.124
Oh, it's just like in those movies.

11:48.207 --> 11:51.001
Any time the nanny is hot,
it just means she's a homicidal maniac.

11:51.085 --> 11:53.295
Go, batter! Swing, batter!

11:53.379 --> 11:54.630
- Really?
- Totally.

11:54.713 --> 11:57.425
At first, she butters you up,
tells you you have the perfect family.

11:57.508 --> 12:00.845
Then one of the parents
calls the nanny agency to ask about her,

12:00.928 --> 12:02.596
and the receptionist is all like,

12:02.680 --> 12:05.724
"We don't have any record
of that person ever having worked here."

12:05.808 --> 12:08.102
And then shit takes a super dark turn.

12:08.853 --> 12:10.563
Hey, can I have some bug juice?

12:11.897 --> 12:16.735
I could eat you up!
Yes, I can! I can eat you up!

12:17.570 --> 12:18.571
I can eat you.

12:28.581 --> 12:31.917
Being at Firewood
brings back a lot of memories, huh?

12:32.001 --> 12:33.294
Yeah.

12:33.377 --> 12:34.420
You know the crazy thing,

12:34.503 --> 12:37.381
I still have that flannel shirt
you gave me the last day of camp.

12:37.465 --> 12:40.509
That old rag? Get out of town!

12:40.593 --> 12:41.886
Yeah.

12:41.969 --> 12:45.431
I remember I was at this picnic once.
It was really cold.

12:45.514 --> 12:50.227
We were eating fennel out of
these little cylindrical paper tubes.

12:50.311 --> 12:52.771
- It was taking me forever to eat.
- Mm.

12:52.855 --> 12:54.690
I've been wearing it ever since.

12:54.773 --> 12:55.608
So what happened?

12:55.691 --> 12:58.611
Did you finally finish your fennel funnel
before you fetched my flannel?

12:58.694 --> 13:02.865
You were always such a wordsmith.
That's probably why you write novels.

13:02.948 --> 13:07.203
Yeah. I write them,
but I don't always finish them.

13:07.286 --> 13:09.955
Well, that sounds like
we both have things we want to finish.

13:10.039 --> 13:12.875
You want to finish the novel
and I want to finish the fennel funnel.

13:14.210 --> 13:15.461
TouchÃ©.

13:16.837 --> 13:18.037
Coop, can I ask you something?

13:18.797 --> 13:21.050
- Sure.
- Do you ever, like...

13:22.885 --> 13:24.595
think about, you know, us?

13:25.804 --> 13:27.724
You know, like,
what would have happened if we...

13:28.057 --> 13:29.517
Like, you know...

13:29.600 --> 13:30.851
Hey, sorry to interrupt.

13:30.935 --> 13:32.787
Katie, there's some guy from your office
on the phone.

13:32.811 --> 13:34.980
He says that they have some fall colors
to pitch you.

13:35.064 --> 13:37.584
Do you want to stop your conversation
with Coop and take the call?

13:37.608 --> 13:40.110
- I should take the call.
- Okay, yeah.

13:40.194 --> 13:41.755
But I still wanna tell you that thing
that I was gonna tell you

13:41.779 --> 13:43.048
- before she interrupted.
- I wanna hear it.

13:43.072 --> 13:45.658
- I'll find you at lunch then?
- Sure. Yeah. Episode four.

13:45.741 --> 13:46.992
- Perfect.
- Okay.

13:47.076 --> 13:49.328
Here we go, batter!
Swing, batter!

13:49.995 --> 13:53.749
Ooh! That's a frozen rope!

13:53.832 --> 13:56.252
Deegs! Deegs! Deegs!

14:02.758 --> 14:04.260
Boom shakalaka.

14:04.343 --> 14:07.930
One small step for man,
one giant leap for the JCs of bunk five!

14:08.639 --> 14:10.891
Andy, he's doing stuff
like you used to do.

14:10.975 --> 14:14.061
He's a turd.
He's ruining the flow of the game. Hey!

14:14.144 --> 14:17.106
Shit or get off the pot!
You're ruining the flow of the game!

14:17.189 --> 14:19.817
You're ruining the flow of my dick,
old man!

14:19.900 --> 14:21.610
- Oh!
- Oh, shit!

14:21.694 --> 14:24.071
I'll show that little river rat
who's an old man.

14:26.866 --> 14:30.035
Hey. Let's pick this motherfucker off.

14:32.663 --> 14:34.665
Give me your glove. I'm taking over first.

14:34.748 --> 14:35.748
Huh?

14:36.000 --> 14:39.128
- Go.
- Dude, who the hell are you?

14:39.670 --> 14:41.630
I'm your second to worst nightmare.

14:42.298 --> 14:43.465
What's my worst nightmare?

14:43.549 --> 14:44.633
Me fucking your mom.

14:46.802 --> 14:48.262
Hey, toss it!

14:49.096 --> 14:50.222
Ooh!

14:50.306 --> 14:52.266
- Bitch.
- Dummy.

14:54.476 --> 14:55.519
Toss it!

14:56.395 --> 14:58.522
Come on! This is so boring!

14:58.606 --> 15:02.192
- You're ruining the flow of the game!
- It's his fault, not mine!

15:02.276 --> 15:05.404
You ever gonna steal second
or are we gonna circle jerk till dinner?

15:06.655 --> 15:07.656
You're a chicken turd.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.843
- You're old and fat, and have gray hair.
- Do something!

15:09.867 --> 15:12.328
Snot comes out of your dong
instead of jism.

15:12.411 --> 15:15.247
You smell like a rotting,
old, fat, bloated corpse.

15:15.331 --> 15:18.959
- You take that back, you stinky bitch.
- Make me, you dirty old shoe.

15:19.627 --> 15:20.961
Second! Throw to second!

15:22.129 --> 15:23.129
Damn it!

15:23.923 --> 15:25.716
Deegs! Deegs! Deegs!

15:26.967 --> 15:30.095
Go to first. I'm taking over.
Let's pick this motherfucker off!

15:30.179 --> 15:32.973
I dare you to steal third, you... Oh, shit!

15:35.851 --> 15:38.270
Deegs! Deegs! Deegs!

15:39.605 --> 15:43.067
Go to second. I'm taking over.
Let's pick this motherfucker off!

15:43.859 --> 15:45.819
I dare you to steal home.

15:48.656 --> 15:50.282
Challenge accepted.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.200
Home! Home!

15:52.242 --> 15:54.995
Throw it home,
you piece of shit!

15:58.832 --> 16:00.376
Deegs! Deegs! Deegs!

16:01.001 --> 16:02.878
This isn't over, tater tot.

16:04.004 --> 16:05.923
Not by a long shot.

16:09.259 --> 16:12.638
Guys, you know I can't believe
that Beth is gonna sell this place.

16:13.472 --> 16:14.598
It's, like, messed up.

16:14.682 --> 16:16.642
I know.
It's been driving me crazy all day.

16:16.725 --> 16:18.060
Let's go talk to her.

16:23.816 --> 16:26.360
Hi, is this Sunny Day Nanny Services?

16:26.443 --> 16:29.154
Yes, my name
is Waldorf Beauregard McKinley,

16:29.238 --> 16:31.466
and I was wondering if I could ask about
one of your nannies.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.575
Her name is Renata Murphy.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.372
You don't have anybody on record
by that name.

16:40.124 --> 16:41.500
Can you double-check?

16:43.544 --> 16:45.587
Okay. Bye.

16:45.671 --> 16:46.839
Bye.

16:48.465 --> 16:50.551
Ben! Ben!

16:51.343 --> 16:52.886
Renata's been lying to us.

16:52.970 --> 16:54.763
No! Claire mentioned something to me

16:54.847 --> 16:57.349
about how hot nannies
are always psycho killers.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.601
Well, guess what?
I called the nanny service

16:59.685 --> 17:02.896
and they have no record
of Renata Murphy on file!

17:02.980 --> 17:04.397
What? That can't be true.

17:04.481 --> 17:07.401
She's lying! There's no file, Ben!
She's got no file!

17:07.483 --> 17:09.694
That's because I'm not Renata Murphy.

17:09.778 --> 17:11.571
I'm Renata Delvecchio.

17:13.365 --> 17:14.950
Well, I was.

17:15.034 --> 17:19.496
Delvecchio was my married name,
but I'm recently divorced.

17:19.579 --> 17:22.750
So I went back to my maiden name,
which is Murphy.

17:22.833 --> 17:25.544
And I guess I just forgot to update it
in their system.

17:26.336 --> 17:29.506
I'm sorry. I'm still getting used to...

17:31.717 --> 17:34.344
remembering that I'm divorced.

17:34.928 --> 17:37.514
Renata, I am so sorry.

17:39.141 --> 17:43.896
Just trying to turn over a new leaf,
be a better person.

17:43.979 --> 17:48.692
- Renata, I don't know what to say.
- It's okay, really. Like, I get it.

17:48.776 --> 17:50.569
You know,
I should've told you guys sooner.

17:50.652 --> 17:53.030
And in this crazy world,
you can't be too careful.

17:53.113 --> 17:57.868
Especially when you have that...
that precious baby girl to protect.

17:57.951 --> 17:59.119
I... I get it.

17:59.203 --> 18:00.662
Oh!

18:00.746 --> 18:03.624
She's ready for her bottle.

18:03.707 --> 18:05.959
Oh, no, no. Don't cry.

18:06.043 --> 18:09.296
- Guess I've got some egg on my face, huh?
- A little bit.

18:10.672 --> 18:13.717
Plus, I just feel so stupid
about misjudging Renata.

18:13.801 --> 18:16.386
Well, can you see now
that everything is fine?

18:16.470 --> 18:19.139
I mean, can you please try and relax?

18:19.223 --> 18:23.102
Oh! I feel like a total dill weed!
I just wanna have fun.

18:23.185 --> 18:24.686
Well, that's what I want, too.

18:24.770 --> 18:27.648
And I'll join you as soon as
I finish up these blueprints.

18:27.731 --> 18:29.817
But I want you to go now.

18:29.900 --> 18:32.027
- Have some fun!
- Okay. Hey!

18:39.409 --> 18:44.123
These blueprints really are
quite literally kicking my ass.

18:46.667 --> 18:50.754
Beth, we've talked, and we've decided
we're not gonna let you sell the camp!

18:50.838 --> 18:53.340
- Absolutely not!
- We demand an explanation!

18:53.423 --> 18:55.008
You need to understand something.

18:55.092 --> 18:57.594
Camps have changed a great deal
since I've started.

18:57.678 --> 18:59.179
They're all specialized now.

18:59.263 --> 19:02.933
I mean, my own daughter
is going to astronomy camp this summer.

19:03.016 --> 19:06.520
In Florida, near her father,
Associate Professor Henry Neumann.

19:07.229 --> 19:10.149
There's theater camp, tennis camp,
take a trip to Venice camp.

19:10.232 --> 19:13.652
There's computer camp, math camp,
presidential staff camp.

19:13.735 --> 19:16.613
Beth, we get it. There are a lot
of different kinds of camps now.

19:16.697 --> 19:18.198
What is your point?

19:20.826 --> 19:25.664
The freezing cold truth hurts,
but here it is.

19:25.747 --> 19:27.332
And I'm gonna serve it up raw.

19:28.333 --> 19:30.061
You know,
for years I would look at that totem

19:30.085 --> 19:33.380
and I would see a glow,
a force, a magical feeling

19:34.464 --> 19:39.052
that covered us all, protected us,
kept us safe and made us good.

19:39.136 --> 19:41.263
And now, I look at it and all I see

19:41.346 --> 19:43.557
is a bunch of weird doodles
carved into a piece of wood.

19:43.640 --> 19:47.436
And if that spirit is gone,
then I do not know what I'm doing here.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.773
But I will find a buyer that cares
about this place as much as we all did.

19:52.357 --> 19:57.321
And it has been an honor
to be your camp director.

19:58.113 --> 19:59.781
Please excuse me.

20:02.326 --> 20:04.161
- Come on.
- Yeah.

20:08.415 --> 20:12.002
You know, George,
the Bill Clinton videotape I sent you...

20:12.085 --> 20:16.423
I bet you dollars for donuts
that he'll defeat you next November.

20:16.506 --> 20:19.092
- Unless...
- Unless what?

20:19.176 --> 20:21.970
Unless I campaign for you, George.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.073
Give 'em a bit of the old Gipper charm.

20:24.097 --> 20:25.849
- Yes.
- They'll do whatever I say.

20:25.933 --> 20:28.936
Oh, hot dog, Mr. President! Hot dog!

20:29.645 --> 20:30.646
Wait.

20:33.565 --> 20:37.110
- What's the catch?
- I'm gonna need a little favor in return.

20:38.195 --> 20:40.906
See, there's this summer camp in Maine.

20:41.531 --> 20:42.658
Camp Firewood.

20:42.741 --> 20:46.453
I had the chance to destroy it
ten years ago, but I didn't,

20:46.536 --> 20:48.747
and I've regretted it ever since.

20:49.790 --> 20:52.584
I want you to help me
finish some unfinished business, George.

20:52.668 --> 20:55.128
What are you saying, Mr. President?

20:55.212 --> 20:59.675
The truth is, my last year in office,
I stole a nuke

21:00.550 --> 21:04.763
and I buried it underneath Camp Firewood
in a secret bunker

21:05.555 --> 21:07.474
that I funded with dark money

21:07.557 --> 21:11.395
and I staffed with my own private team
of military elites.

21:11.478 --> 21:14.690
And I'm gonna blow that shithole camp
to smithereens.

21:14.773 --> 21:18.652
And I need you to give me
the new launch codes.

21:20.612 --> 21:24.574
You want me to... You want me to help you
blow up a summer camp?

21:25.450 --> 21:27.744
I help you, you help me, George.

21:27.828 --> 21:28.972
President Reagan...

21:28.996 --> 21:30.872
I should tell you as your lawyer,

21:30.956 --> 21:33.041
if you destroy property that's not yours,

21:33.125 --> 21:35.544
that'll leave you very vulnerable
to a lawsuit.

21:35.627 --> 21:37.546
We don't want a lawsuit, do we, Ron?

21:37.629 --> 21:41.591
But if you were to own said property,

21:41.675 --> 21:44.553
well, that would be
a horse of a completely different color.

21:45.554 --> 21:46.763
Well...

21:47.597 --> 21:50.976
I guess we'll just have to buy ourselves
a summer camp then, won't we?

21:52.853 --> 21:54.396
I help you...

21:56.064 --> 21:58.483
and you help me, George.

21:59.568 --> 22:04.156
What do you say, Georgie Porgie?
Do we have a deal?

22:04.906 --> 22:08.994
Yes, sir, Mr. President.
You got yourself a deal.
