26:26.711 --> 26:28.379
How's the cereal?
- It's really good.

26:28.421 --> 26:29.630
- Less radioactive?

26:29.672 --> 26:30.631
I'm happy.

26:31.382 --> 26:32.675
- [Max] Morning.

26:38.431 --> 26:39.598
- I have a question.

26:41.392 --> 26:42.601
- For me?
- Mm-hmm.

26:45.730 --> 26:47.481
What was my grandfather like?

26:47.523 --> 26:49.358
- Ezra, Max just woke up.

26:49.400 --> 26:50.693
- Your grandfather?

26:50.735 --> 26:51.610
- Yeah.

26:51.652 --> 26:52.820
He died before I was born.

26:54.113 --> 26:55.614
Was he nice?

26:55.656 --> 26:57.116
- I'd say he was nice.

26:58.701 --> 27:00.745
Your grandfather had
his share of problems.

27:00.786 --> 27:03.164
He did have a hard time
showing his feelings.

27:03.205 --> 27:04.415
- All right.

27:04.457 --> 27:05.750
Come on, we're gonna be late.

27:05.791 --> 27:07.752
- Please, okay, Mom,
are you PMSing?

27:07.793 --> 27:08.502
- Mister, you have
three seconds-

27:08.544 --> 27:09.128
- I'm going, I'm going.

27:11.714 --> 27:14.759
Mom says I remind
her of him sometimes.

27:14.800 --> 27:15.968
The good parts.

27:16.010 --> 27:17.845
That's why I asked.

27:17.887 --> 27:18.763
- The good parts, huh?

27:19.972 --> 27:21.724
- Yeah.

27:21.766 --> 27:24.310
That he used to make her
laugh when she was a kid.

27:24.352 --> 27:25.853
Okay, see you, Max.
- See ya.

27:29.565 --> 27:30.775
- Used to make you laugh.

27:31.776 --> 27:34.111
- Yeah, well, I had
to tell him something.

27:34.153 --> 27:37.406
Look, I have to find a job
today, so eat what you want.

27:38.491 --> 27:40.534
You can square up with me later.

27:40.576 --> 27:41.744
- You must be exhausted.

27:56.008 --> 27:57.760
- Hi, yeah, I'm
calling about the...

27:59.261 --> 28:00.971
Administrative
assistant position.

28:01.013 --> 28:04.225
I just, I can't see
where to email my resume.

28:04.266 --> 28:05.184
- [Woman On Phone]
The job requires

28:05.226 --> 28:06.310
at least two years of college.

28:09.105 --> 28:11.190
- Minimum two years of college?

28:11.232 --> 28:12.733
- [Woman On Phone] Just send
your transcripts.

28:12.775 --> 28:14.902
- Yeah, of course.

28:14.944 --> 28:16.028
- [Woman On Phone] Ready
to write this down?

28:16.070 --> 28:16.821
- Sure.

28:18.614 --> 28:19.782
- [Woman On Phone]
You got a pen?

28:19.824 --> 28:21.617
- Yeah, I have a pen.

28:21.659 --> 28:25.204
- M-A-T-T-I @CasinoCleaners.com

28:25.246 --> 28:27.706
- Okay, thank you, I'll
email that right away.

28:27.748 --> 28:28.541
- [Woman On Phone] Great.

28:36.048 --> 28:38.467
[phone buttons beeping]

28:38.509 --> 28:41.011
[phone ringing]

28:45.766 --> 28:46.517
- Hey, babe.
- What?

28:47.560 --> 28:48.227
- Get that, will ya?

28:53.649 --> 28:55.317
- Hank's.

28:55.359 --> 28:57.778
- Is Hank there?
- He's busy.

28:57.820 --> 28:59.780
- Tell him it's
Max, he'll take it.

29:03.534 --> 29:05.369
- Some guy called
Max on the phone?

29:19.467 --> 29:20.301
- Am I dreaming?

29:20.342 --> 29:21.760
- Another ball-buster, huh?

29:21.802 --> 29:23.554
- Well, you tell me.

29:23.596 --> 29:25.764
She's a pain in my ass,
but she's good to me.

29:25.806 --> 29:26.515
How are you, my friend?

29:26.557 --> 29:28.476
When'd you get out?

29:28.517 --> 29:29.727
- I didn't really get out.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.061
- You escaped, didn't you?

29:31.103 --> 29:32.313
Holy shit!

29:32.354 --> 29:34.064
- Don't get too excited.

29:34.106 --> 29:35.483
- Max.

29:35.524 --> 29:36.650
Come by.

29:36.692 --> 29:37.359
- Listen.

29:39.195 --> 29:41.071
I'm not doing so good.

29:41.113 --> 29:43.365
- Yeah, well, we're
getting old, buddy.

29:44.950 --> 29:47.161
- Look, that seed
money I gave you

29:47.203 --> 29:48.954
100 years ago for the gym.

29:48.996 --> 29:51.373
If you got it,
I could use it.

29:51.415 --> 29:52.333
- Shit, Max.

29:53.626 --> 29:54.793
If I'd known sooner...

29:55.628 --> 29:56.837
It's pretty bad right now.

29:56.879 --> 29:59.673
Most of these fighters
are training for free.

29:59.715 --> 30:01.884
Haven't had a
contender in a while.

30:01.926 --> 30:03.135
- Say no more.

30:03.177 --> 30:04.512
I just thought I'd ask.

30:04.553 --> 30:06.347
- [Hank] I'm an asshole.

30:06.388 --> 30:07.932
I should have been putting
something away, I know, but-

30:07.973 --> 30:09.391
- I gave you that money.

30:09.433 --> 30:10.935
You don't owe me shit.

30:10.976 --> 30:12.603
- Max, if it wasn't for you-

30:12.645 --> 30:13.604
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:13.646 --> 30:14.813
Save it, save it.

30:17.942 --> 30:19.735
- I'll come by and
say a proper hello.

30:19.777 --> 30:22.780
- Oh, I'm at the old house.

30:22.821 --> 30:23.822
- [Hank] Okay, I'll see you.

30:26.408 --> 30:28.953
[phone beeps]

30:44.385 --> 30:45.636
- What's up, twitcher?

30:47.680 --> 30:48.973
Probably deaf as well.

30:49.014 --> 30:50.599
- Nope, I can hear you.

30:50.641 --> 30:51.350
- Oh!

30:51.392 --> 30:52.726
He speaks too.

30:52.768 --> 30:54.395
- And you walk upright.

30:54.436 --> 30:55.437
Amazing.

30:55.479 --> 30:56.230
Evolution.

30:57.940 --> 30:59.358
- Aren't you smart?

30:59.400 --> 31:00.943
- A little, yeah.

31:00.985 --> 31:02.778
It's too bad I can't
say the same about you.

31:03.946 --> 31:05.948
- You want another beating?

31:05.990 --> 31:08.867
- I have a feeling that's
a rhetorical question,

31:08.909 --> 31:09.994
but the answer would be no.

31:12.663 --> 31:14.164
[tense music]

31:14.206 --> 31:14.957
- Oh.

31:16.584 --> 31:20.254
Guess you don't have a big
mouth now, do you, twitcher?

31:25.426 --> 31:28.012
[Max coughing]

31:44.278 --> 31:46.989
[car approaching]

31:52.995 --> 31:53.996
- Yarek?
[car door closes]

31:54.204 --> 31:56.206
The infamous Max MacLeary.

31:58.834 --> 31:59.918
Did you get Botox?

31:59.960 --> 32:01.962
- Fuck you, lots of men get it.

32:04.632 --> 32:07.009
- I told you, boy, we're good.

32:07.051 --> 32:08.969
- Max, relax, I just
wanted to see you.

32:09.011 --> 32:13.932
- You know, our
past dies with me.

32:14.016 --> 32:15.476
I just wanna make that crystal.

32:15.517 --> 32:16.852
- Of course.

32:16.894 --> 32:18.145
Max, you could have
said a lot of things

32:18.187 --> 32:20.981
to make your life
easier, but you didn't,

32:21.023 --> 32:23.692
and that kind of loyalty,
that doesn't exist anymore,

32:23.734 --> 32:27.237
so anything you
need, you just ask.

32:29.281 --> 32:30.032
- Actually.

32:31.909 --> 32:33.202
Your cousin still
do construction?

32:33.243 --> 32:33.952
- Yeah.

32:35.245 --> 32:37.081
Really, that's what you want?

32:38.332 --> 32:40.209
All right, have a
crew here tomorrow,

32:40.250 --> 32:42.086
make you a nice man cave.

32:42.127 --> 32:44.004
Mirrors, bar, the whole thing.

32:51.970 --> 32:53.055
- I have epilepsy.

32:55.015 --> 32:56.350
- That some kind of superpower?

32:58.060 --> 32:59.269
- Yeah.

32:59.311 --> 33:00.521
They call me the Twitcher.

33:07.152 --> 33:09.363
- Aren't you supposed
to be in school?

33:09.405 --> 33:10.489
- That would be correct.

33:12.241 --> 33:14.076
This kid wants to kill me.

33:14.118 --> 33:16.078
- Did you know I was a boxer?

33:16.120 --> 33:18.914
- I didn't even know you existed
until like a few days ago.

33:23.168 --> 33:23.919
- Come on.

33:29.216 --> 33:31.009
Is this the same kid
that beat you up?

33:31.051 --> 33:31.927
- Same one.

33:33.137 --> 33:35.097
He's hated me since
like first grade.

33:35.139 --> 33:36.849
And then he pulled
a knife on me.

33:37.933 --> 33:39.560
What would you do?

33:39.601 --> 33:41.353
- What I would do and
what you should do

33:41.395 --> 33:43.147
are two totally
different things.

33:45.065 --> 33:46.817
- Seriously.
- You fight him.

33:48.402 --> 33:50.487
- But he has a knife.
- Trust me, he won't use it.

33:50.529 --> 33:51.739
How old is he?

33:51.780 --> 33:53.532
- 12, and trust me.

33:53.574 --> 33:55.325
Have you not seen
the news lately?

33:55.367 --> 33:56.535
- Okay, okay.

33:56.577 --> 33:57.161
Stand up.

33:59.621 --> 34:01.248
Do me a favor,
get your hands up.

34:02.958 --> 34:05.085
You always have to
protect yourself.

34:05.127 --> 34:07.129
Chin down, hands up.

34:07.171 --> 34:08.255
Yeah, like that.

34:08.297 --> 34:09.423
And whenever the punch comes,

34:10.883 --> 34:12.176
your fists take the brunt of it.

34:13.886 --> 34:16.180
You might get clipped, but your
hands are always, always up.

34:18.182 --> 34:19.183
That's good, good, good.

34:21.894 --> 34:23.353
You got it, you
got it, you got it.

34:23.395 --> 34:26.440
Good, good, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go.

34:26.482 --> 34:27.816
Wow.

34:27.858 --> 34:28.609
Wow.

34:30.027 --> 34:31.195
I think I need a popsicle.

34:34.406 --> 34:35.073
- Shit, she's home.

34:37.326 --> 34:38.660
- Oh, you came home early?

34:38.702 --> 34:39.745
What happened?

34:39.787 --> 34:40.454
Are you okay?

34:40.496 --> 34:41.205
Did you have a...

34:42.414 --> 34:43.832
- You can say it, Mom.

34:43.874 --> 34:44.875
I didn't have a seizure.

34:46.168 --> 34:47.878
Just my stomach was hurting.

34:50.672 --> 34:52.090
- And what have you
guys been up to?

34:53.425 --> 34:54.301
- Just talking.

34:56.178 --> 34:58.138
- Okay, go wash
up before dinner.

35:03.268 --> 35:04.353
You didn't say anything
to him, did you?

35:04.394 --> 35:06.188
- No.

35:06.230 --> 35:10.400
I'd like to, but since the
kid thinks I'm dead, you know.

35:10.442 --> 35:12.194
- That's my fault?

35:12.236 --> 35:14.488
- He was just showing me the
backyard, you know, the roses.

35:14.530 --> 35:17.199
They must be, God, 30 years old.

35:17.241 --> 35:18.867
I remember when your
mother planted it.

35:21.495 --> 35:22.246
Yeah.

35:23.705 --> 35:24.623
You know...

35:30.170 --> 35:31.922
What are those?

35:31.964 --> 35:33.924
- It's a Rice Krispy treat.

35:33.966 --> 35:36.343
- Rice what?
- Krispies.

35:36.385 --> 35:37.261
- Oh.

35:37.302 --> 35:39.137
- Yeah, try one.
- No, I don't think so.

35:39.179 --> 35:40.430
- You know Max was a boxer?

35:46.520 --> 35:48.730
No, I mean, he was on the
phone and he was saying-

35:48.772 --> 35:49.940
- Are you lying to me?

35:50.983 --> 35:51.942
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

35:53.777 --> 35:55.696
- It wasn't his fault.

35:55.737 --> 35:57.155
We got to talking.

36:00.075 --> 36:02.744
- Did he tell you he
was one of the top

36:02.786 --> 36:04.329
amateur fighters in Nevada?

36:05.289 --> 36:06.540
- He was?

36:06.582 --> 36:07.291
No.

36:08.667 --> 36:09.960
- Go to my room.

36:10.002 --> 36:10.919
- Wait, am I grounded again?

36:10.961 --> 36:12.671
- No, goofy boy, my room.

36:12.713 --> 36:14.673
There's a photo
album, third drawer.

36:17.217 --> 36:19.303
[Max sighs]
- Hey.

36:19.344 --> 36:20.095
- I'm sorry.

36:21.513 --> 36:23.390
Yeah, yeah, it's
fine, I'm sorry.

36:25.309 --> 36:29.271
He came home, and he
asks a lot of questions.

36:29.313 --> 36:31.189
- I know, it's nonstop
with the questions.

36:33.025 --> 36:36.403
He can't just sit
in silence, I guess.

36:36.445 --> 36:38.113
- Oh, he'd make a good lawyer.

36:39.531 --> 36:41.783
You know, you remember when
you wanted to be a lawyer?

36:41.825 --> 36:43.243
Get me out of prison.

36:43.285 --> 36:45.120
- I was seven.

36:45.162 --> 36:46.413
- Oh yeah, but you were smart.

36:48.248 --> 36:50.125
- Aww, look at the baby.

36:52.377 --> 36:53.295
- [Ezra] My first recital.

36:56.548 --> 36:57.966
- Wow.

36:58.008 --> 36:59.509
Cher.

36:59.551 --> 37:00.344
- Yeah.

37:00.385 --> 37:02.554
- Oh, you danced at Caesars?

37:02.596 --> 37:05.557
- Yeah, that was a
short tour because I got

37:05.599 --> 37:08.727
pregnant with somebody
who's sitting on this couch.

37:08.769 --> 37:10.437
[Ezra laughs]
- Oh.

37:12.481 --> 37:14.274
- [Ezra] I haven't
seen this one before.

37:15.609 --> 37:16.985
- Give it back.

37:17.027 --> 37:18.737
- Did you know my grandma?

37:18.779 --> 37:19.529
- A little.

37:20.864 --> 37:22.240
- Mom never talks about her.

37:23.325 --> 37:24.785
Mom never talks
about growing up.

37:24.826 --> 37:26.703
- Because there's
nothing to talk about.

37:26.745 --> 37:27.454
Here.

37:31.875 --> 37:33.335
- When was this taken?

37:35.379 --> 37:37.297
- I think I'm gonna
have to lie down.

37:39.383 --> 37:40.050
[Max groaning]

37:40.092 --> 37:41.301
- Are you okay?

37:41.343 --> 37:43.303
[Max groaning]

37:43.345 --> 37:44.346
Get my phone.

37:44.388 --> 37:45.055
Ezra!

37:45.097 --> 37:45.847
Call 911!

37:47.349 --> 37:48.517
You're okay.

37:48.558 --> 37:53.397
You're okay.
[siren wailing]

37:58.527 --> 38:00.028
- What's wrong with you?

38:00.070 --> 38:01.279
- Max is sick, Ezra.

38:01.321 --> 38:02.406
- Well yeah, I can see that.

38:02.447 --> 38:04.992
Calling the ambulance
kind of gave it away.

38:05.033 --> 38:06.493
- I have cancer, pal.

38:08.328 --> 38:09.830
- Is he gonna die?

38:09.871 --> 38:11.498
- I'll let your grandfather
explain his conditions.

38:11.540 --> 38:12.290
- He's my uncle.

38:14.459 --> 38:16.211
- [Paramedic] Sir, I
think we should take you

38:16.253 --> 38:18.046
to the hospital to
get checked out.

38:18.088 --> 38:18.839
- I'm dying.

38:20.298 --> 38:22.676
Nothing's gonna change that.

38:22.718 --> 38:24.469
- If you're
concerned about this,

38:24.511 --> 38:25.971
we can just call
your parole officer.

38:26.013 --> 38:30.434
- I am not going
to the hospital.

38:32.019 --> 38:33.061
End of story.

38:34.479 --> 38:35.313
Thank you.

38:35.397 --> 38:36.356
Thank you.

38:37.399 --> 38:38.442
Much appreciated.

38:42.863 --> 38:44.072
- What is this?

38:44.114 --> 38:45.657
- Oh, that, that's my new PS5.

38:47.492 --> 38:49.077
- Seriously, what
the hell is going on?

38:49.953 --> 38:51.621
Are you really dying?

38:54.458 --> 38:55.459
- Yes, I am.

38:57.919 --> 39:00.464
[solemn music]

39:46.927 --> 39:48.512
- [Maxine] You do that?

39:48.553 --> 39:50.263
- Yeah, yeah.

39:50.305 --> 39:51.973
I'm feeling a bit better.

39:52.015 --> 39:55.936
Figured I'd take advantage
of the good days.

40:04.569 --> 40:05.445
I've been thinking.

40:07.447 --> 40:08.406
Maybe I should go.

40:08.448 --> 40:10.075
- No, no, no.

40:10.117 --> 40:11.243
You don't have to do that.

40:12.536 --> 40:16.456
- It's just, you
know, Ezra, you...

40:16.498 --> 40:18.291
- Max, I heard you
throwing up in the bathroom.

40:18.333 --> 40:19.459
So gross!

40:19.501 --> 40:20.627
- Good morning.

40:20.669 --> 40:21.503
There's my son.

40:21.545 --> 40:23.964
- Give me a break, Mom, I'm 12.

40:24.005 --> 40:26.550
I don't understand half the
stuff that comes outta my mouth.

40:26.591 --> 40:28.218
- Yeah, I don't buy that.

40:28.260 --> 40:30.554
Since the same kid corrected
my grammar on a school note.

40:30.595 --> 40:32.722
- Who ends a sentence
with a dangling modifier?

40:32.764 --> 40:34.307
It's pretty
straightforward stuff.

40:34.349 --> 40:35.475
- Dangling what?
- No, no, no.

40:35.517 --> 40:37.561
Don't ask, you'll
be here all day.

40:38.770 --> 40:39.813
- Careful.

40:39.855 --> 40:40.939
It's hot.

40:42.023 --> 40:42.649
- [Ezra] Thank you.

40:49.281 --> 40:50.031
- Okay.

40:53.285 --> 40:56.496
So listen, I have
something to tell you.

40:59.416 --> 41:00.584
- That Max is your father?

41:01.543 --> 41:03.461
Which would make
him my grandfather,

41:03.503 --> 41:05.547
who you told me was dead.

41:05.589 --> 41:08.008
I'd say you have
something to tell me.

41:08.049 --> 41:10.594
[pensive music]

41:10.635 --> 41:13.221
I'm still trying to wrap
my head around all of this.

41:13.263 --> 41:14.598
- [Maxine] You sure
you're an honor student?

41:14.639 --> 41:16.975
'Cause I've explained
it like four times.

41:17.017 --> 41:18.018
- Why did you lie to me?

41:19.227 --> 41:21.730
- It's complicated.

41:21.771 --> 41:23.231
- Can I use that
same excuse next time

41:23.273 --> 41:24.441
you ask me if I'm lying?

41:24.482 --> 41:25.483
- No chance.

41:26.818 --> 41:28.653
- Is there anything
else I need to know?

41:28.695 --> 41:30.572
Because if I ever do like
a 23andme at some point.

41:30.614 --> 41:33.033
- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

41:33.074 --> 41:34.743
Watch where you're
going, asshole!

41:34.784 --> 41:36.870
- Dad!
- Ezra, stay in the car.

41:36.912 --> 41:38.788
- Oh, hey, boy, you good?
- Yeah, I'm good!

41:38.830 --> 41:39.497
- Ah.

41:40.790 --> 41:41.875
Man.

41:41.917 --> 41:42.834
- I've missed you.

41:42.876 --> 41:44.252
- Come on, you're gonna be late.

41:44.294 --> 41:45.837
- Mom, five minutes, please.

41:47.088 --> 41:48.006
- Okay, you have until the bell.

41:48.048 --> 41:49.007
- Oh my God.

41:49.049 --> 41:49.883
Are you growing?

41:49.925 --> 41:51.551
You're so tall.

41:51.593 --> 41:53.220
Hey, Mr. Licorice.

41:53.261 --> 41:54.262
Hey, hey, hey.

41:54.304 --> 41:54.888
Check out what I found.

41:56.598 --> 41:58.642
It's my old band's t-shirt,
man, isn't that sick?

41:58.683 --> 42:00.393
- It's amazing.
- You want it?

42:00.435 --> 42:03.605
- Yeah, it's awesome.
- You remember this, Maxine?

42:03.647 --> 42:04.814
- Come on, let's go, it's time.

42:04.856 --> 42:06.608
- [Ezra] It's fine.

42:06.650 --> 42:11.529
- Hey, yo, I got you a
1964 Ludwig drum set.

42:11.571 --> 42:13.615
It's all set up at my
house ready for you

42:13.657 --> 42:14.824
to come and stay with me.

42:14.866 --> 42:16.284
- Can I, Mom, please?

42:16.326 --> 42:18.245
- Yeah, we'll see.

42:18.286 --> 42:19.246
[bell ringing]

42:19.287 --> 42:20.413
Okay, it's time go.

42:20.455 --> 42:21.706
- I'll get the second bell.

42:21.748 --> 42:23.291
Okay, when can I
stay at your place?

42:23.333 --> 42:24.292
- [Maxine] Come on, you can
see your father another time.

42:24.334 --> 42:25.293
- It's fine.
- Say goodbye.

42:25.335 --> 42:26.711
- Mom, I haven't seen him.

42:26.753 --> 42:28.630
- I'm gonna walk you in myself
if you don't go now, okay?

42:28.672 --> 42:29.631
I'm not kidding.

42:29.673 --> 42:30.548
I'll hold your hand.

42:30.590 --> 42:32.050
- Yeah, she makes up the rules.

42:32.092 --> 42:33.343
You know this, all right?

42:34.719 --> 42:36.805
- Can't stop me from seeing him.

42:36.846 --> 42:38.556
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

42:39.641 --> 42:40.684
- I fought the law and...

42:42.560 --> 42:43.770
- The Lord won.

42:43.812 --> 42:45.480
- No, the law won, son.

42:47.107 --> 42:48.692
I love you, buddy.

42:48.733 --> 42:49.818
- Okay.

42:49.859 --> 42:52.112
Bye.
- Go get in there, you genius.

42:54.739 --> 42:57.075
- You can't show
up here like this.

42:57.117 --> 42:58.952
- Relax.

42:58.994 --> 43:01.871
Why do you always treat me
like an asshole all the time?

43:01.913 --> 43:04.124
- Stop being an
asshole all the time.

43:04.165 --> 43:05.500
A new drum set?

43:05.542 --> 43:06.876
- What?
- You're high, Tyler.

43:08.795 --> 43:10.547
All this bullshit pretending
you care about him,

43:10.588 --> 43:11.298
it's not about him.

43:11.339 --> 43:12.966
- I do care about him.

43:13.008 --> 43:15.677
- Well, if you care,
then you'll get clean.

43:15.719 --> 43:17.846
- You can't stop
me from seeing him.

43:17.887 --> 43:18.805
- No?

43:18.847 --> 43:20.140
Watch me.

43:20.181 --> 43:21.141
I'm not putting him through
your bullshit again.

43:21.182 --> 43:23.685
[engine starts]

43:26.396 --> 43:27.147
- Max.

43:29.149 --> 43:30.650
- Took you long enough.

43:30.692 --> 43:32.736
- Between the broad and
these pussy-ass fighters.

43:34.529 --> 43:36.364
- What the hell?

43:36.406 --> 43:38.533
You lost like 40 pounds?

43:38.575 --> 43:41.828
- 48, been sober five
years, eating oatmeal.

43:41.870 --> 43:42.871
- Oh.

43:42.912 --> 43:43.705
Well, I know the
world's going to hell

43:43.747 --> 43:45.165
if you're eating oatmeal.

43:45.206 --> 43:45.999
- Tell me about it.

43:46.041 --> 43:49.169
Look, best I could do.

43:49.210 --> 43:52.422
- I told you it was fine.
- Oh, that's bullshit.

43:52.464 --> 43:54.966
I had to sell a few
things, but here it is.

43:55.008 --> 43:55.633
I owe you, Max.

43:58.428 --> 44:00.138
- I can't take this.

44:00.180 --> 44:01.723
- Fuck you, take it.

44:01.765 --> 44:03.641
If I can scrape together
some more, I will.

44:05.185 --> 44:06.644
- Thanks.

44:06.686 --> 44:08.772
- What's going on here?

44:08.813 --> 44:10.732
- I called in a
favor from Yarek.

44:11.983 --> 44:14.652
- Ah, that's a name
I could live without.

44:14.694 --> 44:17.781
- Oh, we're square.
- Yeah.

44:17.822 --> 44:21.242
Look, I gotta go,
teaching a boxing class

44:21.284 --> 44:23.453
with some old white women.

44:23.495 --> 44:24.954
I'm sorry about your, you know.

44:26.581 --> 44:29.292
- We're all going to
die, Hank, even you.

44:30.460 --> 44:31.419
- Oh yeah.
- No, not me.

44:31.461 --> 44:33.213
Uh- uh, never me.

44:33.254 --> 44:35.799
[both chuckling]

44:35.840 --> 44:36.883
See you, Max.
- See ya.

44:43.640 --> 44:44.808
- What the hell's going on?

44:44.849 --> 44:46.893
I come home, there's
guys working.

44:46.935 --> 44:48.061
What do you think you're doing?

44:48.103 --> 44:50.480
- Oh, just fixing
up a few things.

44:50.522 --> 44:52.899
- You should have asked me.

44:52.941 --> 44:53.900
- I wanted to surprise you.

44:55.193 --> 44:56.444
- Okay.

44:56.486 --> 44:57.779
Well, I'm surprised.

45:02.033 --> 45:06.704
- Hey, did I ever tell you
why we called you Maxine?

45:09.290 --> 45:12.585
- Because you have a giant ego
and you really wanted a boy.

45:12.627 --> 45:14.712
- No, no, it was your mother.

45:16.548 --> 45:17.757
We were young.

45:17.799 --> 45:19.843
We didn't know any better.

45:19.884 --> 45:24.848
But she said you were a natural
born fighter from day one.

45:27.016 --> 45:28.226
- Look how far that got me.

45:29.853 --> 45:31.438
I asked you not to
bring your shit here.

45:31.479 --> 45:33.022
- I'm not.

45:33.064 --> 45:36.401
I promised your mother
years ago that I'd

45:36.443 --> 45:38.736
finish that little
apartment, never did,

45:38.778 --> 45:41.739
I'm doing it now so
you can rent it out.

45:43.324 --> 45:45.493
- Oh, now you wanna keep
your promises to Mom?

45:46.494 --> 45:47.871
You're unbelievable.

45:49.330 --> 45:50.707
What's that?

45:50.748 --> 45:53.042
- This is for you.

45:54.586 --> 45:56.671
It's all I have to my
name, and it's yours.

45:56.713 --> 45:58.047
- I don't want your dirty money.

45:58.089 --> 45:59.132
- It's good money.

45:59.174 --> 46:00.550
- Bullshit!

46:00.592 --> 46:02.510
Knowing you, somebody
got hurt for that money.

46:02.552 --> 46:03.678
- It's clean.

46:04.888 --> 46:07.515
Stop being so
stubborn and take it.

46:07.557 --> 46:10.894
I've also lined up a
job interview for you.

46:10.935 --> 46:11.644
- You what?

46:11.686 --> 46:12.896
- A job, a real job.

46:12.937 --> 46:15.064
A friend of mine.

46:15.106 --> 46:16.816
He's got a bunch of
businesses, I got you in.

46:16.858 --> 46:17.775
- Why?

46:17.817 --> 46:19.068
- Why?

46:19.110 --> 46:19.986
Why?

46:21.613 --> 46:22.780
Because you're my kid.

46:23.907 --> 46:25.325
It's the least I could do.

46:26.326 --> 46:27.118
- Okay, stop.

46:29.704 --> 46:31.164
- Oh, I'm a piece
of shit, I know.

46:31.206 --> 46:33.917
- No, you don't
get off that easy.

46:36.044 --> 46:39.088
Now you're trying to
take responsibility?

46:39.130 --> 46:42.300
Now you wanna keep
your promises to Mom?

46:42.342 --> 46:43.843
I had to sit in this
house and watch her

46:43.885 --> 46:44.928
drink herself to death.

46:47.138 --> 46:48.598
- Your mother had problems.

46:48.640 --> 46:50.600
- Yeah, no shit
she had problems.

46:50.642 --> 46:52.101
You didn't have to wake
up at three in the morning

46:52.143 --> 46:55.355
to her screaming, lying on
the kitchen floor, here.

46:55.396 --> 46:56.898
Right here.

46:56.940 --> 46:58.858
Drunk off her ass,
knife in her hand.

46:58.900 --> 47:00.735
She was cutting her arms.

47:00.777 --> 47:03.988
She was too fucked up
to even kill herself.

47:04.030 --> 47:05.615
And then when she saw me,
she started screaming,

47:05.657 --> 47:07.700
"I hate you, I hate you.

47:07.742 --> 47:08.910
You've ruined my life."

47:10.453 --> 47:12.038
You didn't have
to deal with that.

47:12.080 --> 47:13.623
I did.

47:13.665 --> 47:17.001
I would wait for her to pass
out, drag her ass to bed,

47:17.043 --> 47:20.380
clean up the blood,
and go to school hungry

47:20.421 --> 47:22.966
because she'd spent
all her money on booze.

47:23.007 --> 47:24.634
I had to deal with that.

47:24.676 --> 47:26.135
And where were you?

47:26.177 --> 47:27.929
I'll tell you.

47:27.971 --> 47:32.058
You were off in Miami
doing some messed up shit,

47:32.100 --> 47:33.434
or you were in prison.

47:33.476 --> 47:34.978
Mostly in prison.

47:36.020 --> 47:37.730
But I'll tell you
where you weren't.

47:37.772 --> 47:38.481
You weren't here.

47:39.440 --> 47:41.317
- Maxie, please.

47:41.359 --> 47:44.988
- But I stayed right to the
end, because that's what you do.

47:46.447 --> 47:47.865
So don't come in here now
like you're some kind of

47:47.907 --> 47:49.242
fucking hero, 'cause you're not.

47:55.665 --> 47:57.584
- You have every
reason to hate me.

47:57.625 --> 47:58.918
I'm sorry.

47:58.960 --> 48:01.212

go their way in business,

01:10:33.855 --> 01:10:34.522
- It's okay.

01:10:35.857 --> 01:10:37.400
- What's happening?

01:10:38.610 --> 01:10:39.527
[phone ringing]
Is it gonna be okay?

01:10:39.569 --> 01:10:40.236

How can I help you?

01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:48.328
- Hi.

01:10:48.370 --> 01:10:50.330
Yeah, I need to speak
to the warden, please.

01:10:50.372 --> 01:10:52.415
- [Man On Phone]
One minute, please.

01:10:52.457 --> 01:10:55.335
- [Warden] Maxine, I have
already heard about it.

01:10:57.379 --> 01:10:58.338
Now put the officer
on the phone.

01:10:58.380 --> 01:10:59.381
- Could you just
talk to him, please?

01:10:59.422 --> 01:11:01.424
I have him on the
phone right now.

01:11:02.634 --> 01:11:04.260
- Hello?

01:11:04.302 --> 01:11:05.303
- [Warden] Put him on the phone.

01:11:05.345 --> 01:11:06.471
- Yes, sir, here he is.

01:11:07.555 --> 01:11:08.264
- Hello?

01:11:10.225 --> 01:11:12.769
- [Warden] Max, you got yourself
in quite a situation there.

01:11:14.437 --> 01:11:19.401
- A little bit, but
I'm not gonna lie.

01:11:20.026 --> 01:11:21.069
It was kind of worth it.

01:11:22.821 --> 01:11:24.364
- Mm-hmm.

01:11:24.406 --> 01:11:28.827
Well, this is the first
and the last time.

01:11:28.868 --> 01:11:31.162
I don't have any more
strings to pull for you, Max.

01:11:31.204 --> 01:11:32.288
- Right, right.

01:11:33.081 --> 01:11:34.416
Thank you.

01:11:34.457 --> 01:11:36.167
- Put the officer
back on the phone.

- Let him go.

01:11:38.128 --> 01:11:38.795

Thank you, thank you so much.

Wow.

- I'm scared.

01:12:09.117 --> 01:12:09.826
It's my first day.

01:12:09.868 --> 01:12:10.618

I'm not losing my
job just because

01:13:21.564 --> 01:13:24.442
you are letting some stupid

I be if I didn't ground you?

this, best I could do.

at least a grand.

but I'm proud of him.

your mom's dad, Max?

- Yeah, he's been
living with us.

Okay, just try to come to my
birthday party on Saturday.

Okay, bye.

01:15:53.925 --> 01:15:55.677
- It was Dad, okay, but
Mom, before you freak out-

01:15:55.718 --> 01:15:57.303
- Did you tell him
about Saturday?

01:15:58.137 --> 01:15:59.138
- I'm not gonna lie.

Okay, I was gonna lie,
but I did tell him, yes.

your father calls,

just give me the damn phone.

He's my dad.

- I've got to get
rid of that landline.

01:16:16.614 --> 01:16:17.824
- Maybe you should
think about it.

01:16:17.865 --> 01:16:19.659
- Oh, don't you start.

01:16:19.701 --> 01:16:22.120

Ezra's a big boy.

- Actually, it's the best
thing that's happened to us

01:16:39.637 --> 01:16:40.430
in a long time.

01:16:47.103 --> 01:16:49.731

using for your son's birthday?

- Okay, stop, stop.

01:16:55.653 --> 01:16:57.697
Can we just be
real for a second?

01:16:59.991 --> 01:17:01.159
You're an addict, Tyler.

01:17:08.166 --> 01:17:09.834
- Do you think I
want to be this way?

01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:14.422
- This is about Ezra,
and he's gonna hate me

01:17:14.464 --> 01:17:15.673
if I don't let him see you.

01:17:15.715 --> 01:17:18.009

think's gonna happen?

01:17:18.051 --> 01:17:18.760
Huh?

01:17:22.764 --> 01:17:24.932
Just let me teach him how
to play the drums, huh?

01:17:24.974 --> 01:17:27.143
It's the one goddamn
thing I'm good at.

01:17:27.185 --> 01:17:28.644
It's the one thing.
- I know.

01:17:30.271 --> 01:17:32.148
Just stop using
for one day, okay?

01:17:32.190 --> 01:17:32.982

- Hey, Grandpa.

01:17:49.707 --> 01:17:50.666
I was telling them
how you used to

01:17:50.708 --> 01:17:52.210
beat people up for a living.

01:17:52.251 --> 01:17:53.753
You went to prison.

01:17:53.795 --> 01:17:55.880
- Somebody actually paid
you to beat people up?

01:17:55.922 --> 01:17:57.465
How much?

01:17:57.507 --> 01:17:58.674

who wants pizza?

- You don't have to
touch every slice.

- Yeah, he just
wants to lay down.

- Dad!

- Bottom of the ninth,
here comes raw daddy-oh!

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

baseball glove, huh?

That's real leather, man.

"okay, thanks, Dad."

How you doing, Maxie, huh?

01:18:38.297 --> 01:18:39.549
- Can we speak for a second?

01:18:41.884 --> 01:18:45.721

and Daddy need to talk.

01:18:47.265 --> 01:18:48.015

You're not clean.

01:18:54.063 --> 01:18:57.608
- Look, I'm trying to be
a part of my kid's life.

01:18:57.650 --> 01:18:59.610
Isn't that a good thing?

01:18:59.652 --> 01:19:00.528
- No, you've gotta go.

01:19:00.570 --> 01:19:01.737
- No, no, whoa, hey, wait.

01:19:01.779 --> 01:19:03.990
Will you quit breaking my balls?

01:19:04.031 --> 01:19:04.949
All right?

01:19:04.991 --> 01:19:06.492
I'm hanging with Ezra.

01:19:06.534 --> 01:19:09.829
It's the birthday party.

01:19:09.871 --> 01:19:11.747
Oh shit, yo, whoa,
whoa, we got pepperoni.

01:19:11.789 --> 01:19:12.498
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Whoa.

01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:13.916
Oh.

01:19:13.958 --> 01:19:15.293
- I got it.
- No, no, I got it, I got it.

01:19:15.334 --> 01:19:16.836
I got it, I got it, chill,
chill, chill, chill.

01:19:16.878 --> 01:19:17.879
Bro, I got it.
- I got it.

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:19.255
- No, that's what
the ground's for.

01:19:19.297 --> 01:19:20.965
- [Maxine] It's fine.

01:19:21.007 --> 01:19:23.634
- Come on, no party foul.

01:19:23.676 --> 01:19:25.303
No way.

01:19:25.344 --> 01:19:26.637
See?
- Dad, stop.

01:19:26.679 --> 01:19:27.388
- Mm.

01:19:28.306 --> 01:19:29.807
Oh, come on, what?

01:19:29.849 --> 01:19:31.893
Come on, man, you want
me to stay, don't you?

01:19:31.934 --> 01:19:34.520
Come on, tell your mom
you want me to stay.

01:19:34.562 --> 01:19:37.982
- I do, but you're not...

01:19:38.024 --> 01:19:39.525
You just knocked
over everything.

01:19:42.570 --> 01:19:44.113
- It was an accident.

01:19:44.155 --> 01:19:45.615
Was she brainwashing you, man?

01:19:46.908 --> 01:19:49.660
Did you tell my kid
I'm the bad guy?

01:19:49.702 --> 01:19:50.828
- It's fine.
- No, I'm his father!

01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:52.079
- It's fine.
- I'm his father!

01:19:52.121 --> 01:19:52.830
- Stay, okay?

01:19:52.872 --> 01:19:53.789
It's fine.

01:19:53.831 --> 01:19:55.041
Stay here.

01:19:55.082 --> 01:19:56.792
- You're fuckin-A
right I'm staying.

01:19:56.834 --> 01:19:58.336
It's a party.

01:19:58.377 --> 01:20:00.087
Fucking-A, right.

01:20:00.129 --> 01:20:01.130
I'm staying, I'm fucking
staying,

01:20:01.172 --> 01:20:02.173
we're gonna have a
party.

01:20:03.925 --> 01:20:05.176
- Okay, kids.

01:20:05.218 --> 01:20:06.761
Why don't we go
into the front yard.

01:20:06.802 --> 01:20:07.512
- Come on, let's celebrate.

01:20:07.553 --> 01:20:08.262
Hey, hey.

01:20:08.304 --> 01:20:09.472
Gimme a beer.

01:20:09.597 --> 01:20:10.932
Gimme a beer.

01:20:10.973 --> 01:20:11.891
Where's the candles?

01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:14.519
Bring the cake!

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:16.562
Don't be a fucking bitch!

01:20:16.604 --> 01:20:18.856
I'm trying to have a good
fucking time, are you?

01:20:18.898 --> 01:20:21.067
- Maxie, everything okay?

01:20:21.108 --> 01:20:22.860
- [laughs] Great.

01:20:24.946 --> 01:20:28.157
Oh, look who just decided
to show up and play daddy-o.

01:20:28.199 --> 01:20:30.493
- Well, you know
about that, don't you?

01:20:30.535 --> 01:20:31.702
- Max, please, go inside.

01:20:31.744 --> 01:20:32.912
We're fine.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:20:32.954 --> 01:20:34.830
You better get your
old ass back inside.

01:20:34.872 --> 01:20:35.957
Hmm?

01:20:35.998 --> 01:20:38.417
- Look, you can see
Ezra another time.

01:20:40.044 --> 01:20:41.963
- Oh, now you're
trying to tell me

01:20:42.004 --> 01:20:44.757
when I can and can't
see my son, is that it?

01:20:44.799 --> 01:20:46.092
What are you gonna do
about it, tough guy?

01:20:46.133 --> 01:20:47.843
Huh?

01:20:47.885 --> 01:20:48.594
- Look at him.

01:20:49.679 --> 01:20:50.888
He's embarrassed.

01:20:52.181 --> 01:20:54.392
Be smart for once in
your fucking life.

01:20:56.185 --> 01:20:58.854
- You better get your ass back
inside before you get hurt.

01:21:02.191 --> 01:21:04.402
- I'm gonna ask
you one last time.

01:21:05.444 --> 01:21:06.904
- Or what?

01:21:06.946 --> 01:21:09.240
- Tyler, you know
me, you know I'm not

01:21:09.282 --> 01:21:10.950
a fucking around kind of guy.

01:21:12.285 --> 01:21:14.370
[Tyler chuckling]

01:21:14.412 --> 01:21:15.955
[Tyler grunts]

01:21:15.997 --> 01:21:17.123
- Tyler!

01:21:17.164 --> 01:21:19.917
[Tyler grunting]

01:21:26.048 --> 01:21:26.924
Dad!

01:21:26.966 --> 01:21:27.925
Stop it!

01:21:30.428 --> 01:21:31.429
Ezra!

01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:33.014
[Ezra gasping]

01:21:33.055 --> 01:21:36.392
[tense music]

01:21:36.434 --> 01:21:37.018
It's okay.

01:21:38.519 --> 01:21:41.480
[Tyler groaning]

01:21:41.522 --> 01:21:42.607
Get away from him!

01:21:42.648 --> 01:21:43.899
All of you!

01:21:43.941 --> 01:21:44.650
Go!

01:21:56.996 --> 01:21:58.456
It's okay, baby.

01:21:58.497 --> 01:21:59.874
It's okay.

01:21:59.915 --> 01:22:01.042
I got you.

01:22:01.083 --> 01:22:02.084
It's okay.

01:22:04.670 --> 01:22:07.923
[soft keyboard music]

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:21.937
[Maxine sighs]

01:22:24.065 --> 01:22:26.984
- Was that a birthday party
or was that a birthday party?

01:22:27.026 --> 01:22:28.527
- Jesus Christ.

01:22:28.569 --> 01:22:30.780
This fucking family.

01:22:31.947 --> 01:22:34.450
[both laughing]

01:22:38.037 --> 01:22:39.080
- I get it, Mom.

01:22:41.666 --> 01:22:42.750
Dad's a drug addict.

01:22:45.044 --> 01:22:46.962
And a very angry
man, by the way.

01:22:49.298 --> 01:22:52.176
- I don't know how you do it.

01:22:52.218 --> 01:22:54.011
You are an amazing kid.

01:22:56.806 --> 01:22:57.598
- How do you think?

01:22:58.891 --> 01:22:59.600
It's you.

01:23:06.774 --> 01:23:09.110
[gentle music]

01:23:10.778 --> 01:23:11.570
How's Grandpa?

01:23:14.490 --> 01:23:16.659
- I don't know.

01:23:16.701 --> 01:23:18.077
I should go check.

01:23:24.291 --> 01:23:25.084
- I love you, Mom.

01:23:26.544 --> 01:23:28.087
- I love you more.

01:23:32.174 --> 01:23:34.009
- [Max] Ezra okay?

01:23:34.051 --> 01:23:34.760
- Yeah.

01:23:34.802 --> 01:23:36.554
- I'm sorry, Maxie.

01:23:36.595 --> 01:23:37.805
I lost it.

01:23:37.847 --> 01:23:39.390
- Yeah, story of your life.

01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:42.601
- He'll hurt that boy one day.

01:23:43.561 --> 01:23:45.104
You too.

01:23:45.146 --> 01:23:46.313
- That doesn't
give you the right

01:23:46.355 --> 01:23:47.565
to beat the shit out of
him right in front of Ezra.

01:23:47.606 --> 01:23:49.817
- I behaved like a pig.

01:23:49.859 --> 01:23:50.943
You deserve better.

01:23:56.949 --> 01:24:00.578
- Does the pig need a lift
to his appointment tomorrow?

01:24:00.619 --> 01:24:02.788
- No, no, no, Hank's got me.

01:24:08.252 --> 01:24:09.253
Maxie.

01:24:14.133 --> 01:24:16.218
I just want to
thank you for this.

01:24:20.181 --> 01:24:21.182
For all of it.

01:24:33.861 --> 01:24:36.280
[solemn music]

01:24:46.916 --> 01:24:47.833
- [Doctor] Max, let's talk.

01:24:47.875 --> 01:24:49.960
- You were right about the pain.

01:24:50.002 --> 01:24:50.878
What do you think?

01:24:51.921 --> 01:24:53.214
Too late for treatment?

01:24:54.882 --> 01:24:56.175
- [Doctor] Normally,
I'd say yes,

01:24:56.217 --> 01:24:58.093
but you're a tough
son of a bitch.

01:25:02.932 --> 01:25:04.391
- What kind of time
am I looking at?

01:25:05.935 --> 01:25:07.353
- [Doctor] It's hard to say.

01:25:07.394 --> 01:25:09.230
Maybe an extra month.

01:25:09.271 --> 01:25:10.481
Why don't you think
about it, Max?

01:25:12.233 --> 01:25:13.859
At least let me write you a
prescription for the pain.

01:25:21.116 --> 01:25:22.910
[knocking on door]

01:25:22.952 --> 01:25:24.245
- Get that, would you?

01:25:24.286 --> 01:25:25.913
- [Ezra] I'm brushing my teeth!

01:25:27.832 --> 01:25:30.417
- Is there any chance we
won't be late one day?

01:25:30.459 --> 01:25:31.252
- [Ezra] Probably not.

01:25:37.967 --> 01:25:38.884
- What are you gonna do, Maxie?

01:25:38.926 --> 01:25:39.718
- Stop it, Tyler!

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:42.137
Stop!
- Let me in.

01:25:42.179 --> 01:25:43.430
Let me fucking in!

01:25:54.942 --> 01:25:55.693
- Do me a favor.

01:25:56.986 --> 01:25:57.778
When I'm gone...

01:25:59.488 --> 01:26:00.364
- You're not gone yet.

01:26:02.283 --> 01:26:06.161
- When I'm gone, pop in from
time to time, check up on them.

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:10.291
Maybe hire Ezra part-time.

01:26:14.086 --> 01:26:14.795
- Okay.

01:26:19.758 --> 01:26:21.093
- How bad was I?

01:26:23.304 --> 01:26:24.221
- What do you mean?

01:26:24.263 --> 01:26:27.182
- I mean, how bad was I?

01:26:28.809 --> 01:26:29.560
The truth.

01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:35.399
My head's so fogged up, I don't
know up from down anymore.

01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:37.401
So.

01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:41.113
- You were bad, Max.

01:26:44.408 --> 01:26:47.786
Ain't nobody around to
tell how bad you were.

01:26:50.789 --> 01:26:53.500
I'm sorry, but you
wanted the truth.

01:27:05.971 --> 01:27:08.432
[engine starts]

01:27:12.186 --> 01:27:16.857
[baby crying]
[dogs barking]

01:27:18.275 --> 01:27:19.485
- Maxie?

01:27:19.526 --> 01:27:20.235
Ezra?

01:27:24.239 --> 01:27:25.240
Maxie?

01:27:28.535 --> 01:27:29.536
Ezra?

01:27:35.292 --> 01:27:36.293
- [Maxie] Tyler, you're scaring
him.

01:27:36.335 --> 01:27:37.628
- You guys home?

01:27:37.670 --> 01:27:38.754
- [Tyler] If you weren't
such a selfish bitch!

01:27:38.796 --> 01:27:39.546
- Jesus.

01:27:41.966 --> 01:27:45.636
- [Maxine] Tyler, think
about what you're doing.

01:27:46.553 --> 01:27:47.262
- Maxie?

01:27:48.806 --> 01:27:50.265
Maxie?

01:27:50.307 --> 01:27:54.311
- Tyler!
[tires squealing]

01:27:54.353 --> 01:27:56.063
- Maxie.

01:27:56.105 --> 01:27:58.315
- Tyler, please pick up.

01:27:58.357 --> 01:28:01.402
I promise I won't call the
cops, just bring Ezra back.

01:28:01.443 --> 01:28:02.861
- Maxie.

01:28:02.903 --> 01:28:03.737
Where's Ezra?

01:28:03.779 --> 01:28:05.364
Oh, jeez.

01:28:05.406 --> 01:28:06.824
- I tried to fight him off.

01:28:06.865 --> 01:28:08.617
- This is my fault.

01:28:08.659 --> 01:28:11.412
And I promise you, I
promise you, I will never,

01:28:12.371 --> 01:28:15.207
never let that piece
of shit harm you again.

01:28:26.051 --> 01:28:27.678
Wait here.

01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:28.804
- I just want him back.

01:28:28.846 --> 01:28:30.097
Please, that's it.

01:28:30.139 --> 01:28:32.641
- When I send him out, drive.

01:28:32.683 --> 01:28:33.434
You hear me?

01:28:34.643 --> 01:28:36.020
Don't look back.

01:28:36.061 --> 01:28:38.397
Don't think, just drive.

01:28:39.648 --> 01:28:43.318
Give that kid the
life he deserves.

01:28:47.156 --> 01:28:48.449
- I love you, Dad.

01:28:48.490 --> 01:28:50.534
- I love you too, Maxie.

01:28:52.119 --> 01:28:52.870
Never stopped.

01:28:56.957 --> 01:28:59.460
[tense music]

01:29:11.930 --> 01:29:15.851
- We're gonna go camping, it's
gonna be fucking great, man.

01:29:15.893 --> 01:29:17.686
It's gonna be me and you, bro.

01:29:17.728 --> 01:29:18.896
We're gonna be going down there.

01:29:18.937 --> 01:29:21.273
Gonna go down to
fucking Tijuana,

01:29:21.315 --> 01:29:23.442
gonna be getting
some fucking ladies.

01:29:23.484 --> 01:29:24.485
Me and you, man.

01:29:26.945 --> 01:29:27.946
- Where is he?!

01:29:30.074 --> 01:29:31.116
- Where's who?

01:29:31.158 --> 01:29:32.868
- Listen to me, you cunt!

01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:35.579
Where the fuck is he?!

01:29:35.621 --> 01:29:36.371
- Grandpa!

01:29:38.665 --> 01:29:41.126
- Don't you fucking touch him!

01:29:41.168 --> 01:29:41.960
- Ezra.

01:29:42.002 --> 01:29:43.045
What are you doing?

01:29:43.087 --> 01:29:43.921
I'm your dad, not him.

01:29:43.962 --> 01:29:44.963
- You okay?

01:29:45.005 --> 01:29:46.090
- Yeah.
- Get over here!

01:29:46.131 --> 01:29:47.257
- Go.

01:29:47.299 --> 01:29:47.883
Your mother's waiting for you.

01:29:47.925 --> 01:29:49.301
Just go.

01:29:49.343 --> 01:29:50.719
- Promise me you won't hurt him.

01:29:50.761 --> 01:29:51.845
- I promise.
