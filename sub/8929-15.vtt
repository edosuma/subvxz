11:04.976 --> 11:06.543

11:06.643 --> 11:08.577
Why don't we just take it back to the base

11:08.677 --> 11:10.044
and use the restoration chamber?

11:10.144 --> 11:11.643
No time.

11:11.743 --> 11:14.978
Stasis lock only slowed down the spark's deterioration.

11:15.077 --> 11:17.611
We have to get this protoform online

19:36.561 --> 19:38.894
You're Rhinox.

19:38.994 --> 19:40.662
How'd you know?

19:40.762 --> 19:45.362
Uh, I'm not sure. But I think I owe you my life.

19:46.963 --> 19:49.496
Let's say we're even.

19:53.230 --> 19:56.331
You were a little late this time, Optimus.

19:56.431 --> 20:00.631
Fortunately, Airazor took care of business, heh-heh.

20:00.731 --> 20:04.065
They'll be salvaging Terrorsaur for days.

20:04.165 --> 20:06.966
Welcome to the Maximals.

20:07.066 --> 20:08.366
My pleasure.

20:08.466 --> 20:11.233
Though I'm still not sure what to make of all this.

20:11.333 --> 20:14.334
Yeah, if you're smart, you'll make tracks.

20:14.434 --> 20:16.034
Pay no attention to the rodent.

20:16.134 --> 20:18.035
He was born with a major glitch.

20:18.135 --> 20:21.635
You'll get used to everything, including them.

20:21.735 --> 20:22.835
Maybe.

20:22.936 --> 20:26.436
Now, how about a tour of the base?

20:28.803 --> 20:33.836
When a spark goes online, there's great joy.
