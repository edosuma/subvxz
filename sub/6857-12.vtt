00:16.555 --> 00:18.042
<i>Diplomacy</i>

00:18.210 --> 00:19.262
<i>or deception?</i>

00:19.387 --> 00:22.797
<i>The council of neutral systems
speaks for over 1,500 worlds</i>

00:22.965 --> 00:25.065
<i>who want to stay out of the war.</i>

00:25.246 --> 00:27.344
<i>But rumors have reached
the Republic Senate,</i>

00:27.513 --> 00:29.402
<i>suggesting that the council's
new leader,</i>

00:29.527 --> 00:31.222
<i>Duchess Satine of Mandalore,</i>

00:31.390 --> 00:33.285
<i>is secretly building her own army</i>

00:33.410 --> 00:35.610
<i>to fight for the Separatist cause.</i>

00:35.836 --> 00:38.062
<i>Now Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi</i>

00:38.230 --> 00:41.107
<i>has been sent to Mandalore
to discover the truth</i>

00:41.275 --> 00:42.775
<i>behind these claims.</i>

00:55.581 --> 00:57.916
The Duchess awaits you,
General Kenobi.

00:59.140 --> 01:01.940
Far be it for me
to keep the Duchess waiting.

01:26.238 --> 01:28.450
Thank you for meeting with me,
Prime Minister Almec.

01:28.575 --> 01:30.435
I welcome you
as a servant of the people,

01:30.560 --> 01:34.110
but I am troubled by the false rumors
that brought you here.

01:34.495 --> 01:36.895
Mandalore would never turn
against the Republic.

01:37.020 --> 01:40.320
The Duchess Satine values peace
more than her own life.

01:40.876 --> 01:43.020
I'm aware of the Duchess' views.

01:43.212 --> 01:46.505
Master Kenobi,
Mandalore's violent past is behind us.

01:46.675 --> 01:49.975
All of our warriors were exiled
to our moon, Concordia.

01:50.330 --> 01:52.490
They died out years ago.

01:53.515 --> 01:54.815
Are you certain?

01:55.112 --> 01:58.462
I recently encountered a man
who wore Mandalorian armor,

01:58.773 --> 01:59.823
Jango Fett.

02:00.105 --> 02:02.281
Jango Fett
was a common bounty hunter.

02:02.406 --> 02:04.636
How he acquired that armor
is beyond me.

02:04.761 --> 02:06.025
Well, Master Kenobi,

02:07.486 --> 02:10.436
my shining Jedi Knight
to the rescue once again.

02:17.204 --> 02:20.623
After all these years,
you're even more beautiful than ever.

02:20.895 --> 02:23.918
Kind words from a man
who accuses me of treachery.

02:25.754 --> 02:29.086
I would never accuse you
of personal wrongdoing, Duchess.

02:29.211 --> 02:33.071
However, a Separatist saboteur
attacked one of our Republic cruisers,

02:33.196 --> 02:35.068
a Mandalorian saboteur.

02:43.332 --> 02:44.856
You must be mistaken.

02:44.981 --> 02:48.627
No Mandalorian would engage
in such violence. Not anymore.

02:49.059 --> 02:50.601
Where is this prisoner now?

02:50.726 --> 02:53.656
He took his own life
rather than submit to questioning.

02:54.382 --> 02:57.994
I know these commandos fought
in many wars, often against the Jedi.

02:58.162 --> 03:01.445
Every one of my people
is as trustworthy as I am.

03:01.570 --> 03:03.477
I know we sound defensive, but...

03:03.602 --> 03:06.462
Clearly your investigation
was ordered because the Senate

03:06.587 --> 03:08.881
is eager to intervene
in our affairs.

03:09.006 --> 03:12.006
My investigation was ordered
by the Jedi Council.

03:13.236 --> 03:14.636
I stand corrected.

03:16.747 --> 03:19.516
Perhaps you'd like to join me
on a walk through the city.

03:40.227 --> 03:43.164
It's so good to see you again.

03:44.730 --> 03:48.480
- Despite the circumstances.
- Your peaceful ways have paid off.

03:49.001 --> 03:51.798
Mandalore has prospered
since the last time I was here.

03:51.967 --> 03:54.588
Not everyone on Mandalore
believes that our commitment to peace

03:54.713 --> 03:56.363
is a sign of progress.

03:56.979 --> 03:58.279
There is a group

03:58.889 --> 04:00.604
that calls itself Death Watch.

04:00.729 --> 04:03.912
I imagine these are the renegades
you're looking for.

04:04.037 --> 04:07.536
They idolize violence
and the warrior ways of the past.

04:08.182 --> 04:10.649
There are those among us,
certain officials who are

04:10.774 --> 04:12.944
working to root out these criminals.

04:13.113 --> 04:15.280
It has been
an ongoing investigation.

04:15.449 --> 04:18.199
How widespread
is this Death Watch movement?

04:18.535 --> 04:20.548
It's hardly a movement.

04:20.673 --> 04:22.318
It's a small group of hooligans

04:22.443 --> 04:25.593
who choose to vandalize public places,
nothing more.

04:25.718 --> 04:28.018
We shall soon have them in custody.

04:28.545 --> 04:31.170
We have tracked them down
to our moon, Concordia.

04:31.338 --> 04:33.288
I hope you're right, Duchess.

04:38.542 --> 04:42.442
I do not understand why the arrival
of this Jedi doesn't upset you.

04:42.726 --> 04:44.750
You promised to support
the Death Watch forces

04:44.875 --> 04:48.313
so we could overthrow the Duchess Satine
and her weak peace-loving government.

04:48.482 --> 04:51.637
<i>And I intend to keep my promise.</i>

04:51.817 --> 04:54.561
But how?
If the Republic interferes now,

04:54.686 --> 04:57.405
Death Watch will not be able
to take over the planet.

04:57.574 --> 04:58.526
<i>Consider:</i>

04:58.651 --> 05:02.001
<i>once the Senate orders
peacekeeping troops to Mandalore,</i>

05:02.428 --> 05:05.628
<i>the people will be surrounded
by a military presence.</i>

05:05.753 --> 05:07.189
<i>Most distasteful.</i>

05:07.915 --> 05:09.250
<i>They will rebel.</i>

05:09.571 --> 05:11.496
And rally to Death Watch.

05:11.866 --> 05:14.066
Our insurgency will grow stronger.

05:15.391 --> 05:17.988
<i>And Duchess Satine shall fall.</i>

05:21.076 --> 05:23.988
A peacekeeper belongs
on the front lines of conflict.

05:24.113 --> 05:26.559
Otherwise, he wouldn't be able
to do his job.

05:26.727 --> 05:28.406
The work of a peacekeeper

05:28.531 --> 05:31.742
is to make sure that conflict
does not arise.

05:32.024 --> 05:33.644
Yes, a noble description,

05:33.769 --> 05:35.469
but not a realistic one.

05:35.694 --> 05:38.981
Is reality what makes a Jedi
abandon his ideals?

05:39.106 --> 05:42.867
Or is it simply a response
to political convenience?

05:45.995 --> 05:48.145
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

05:55.962 --> 05:58.966
Hooligans couldn't have arranged
an attack of this scale.

05:59.285 --> 06:01.886
Then this must be the work of
an off-worlder.

06:03.054 --> 06:04.393
Are you sure of that?

06:09.519 --> 06:10.978
The sign of the Death Watch.

06:14.180 --> 06:16.230
This goes far beyond vandalism.

06:16.543 --> 06:19.237
This is a political statement
against your government

06:19.556 --> 06:20.856
and against you.

06:21.782 --> 06:25.132
You're not safe here.
I'm taking you back to the palace.

06:27.454 --> 06:29.331
I want to interview everyone here.

06:29.456 --> 06:31.206
Nobody leaves this scene.

06:34.044 --> 06:35.044
You there!

06:51.146 --> 06:52.853
I only want to talk.

07:02.778 --> 07:04.528
I don't want to hurt you.

07:05.326 --> 07:06.367
Stay back!

07:40.663 --> 07:42.063
What is he saying?

07:55.535 --> 07:58.735
He was speaking in the dialect
they use on Concordia,

07:59.295 --> 08:00.295
our moon.

08:00.465 --> 08:03.063
I shall like to visit
this moon of yours.

08:03.188 --> 08:05.092
Perhaps I could accompany the body.

08:05.260 --> 08:08.586
The Concordian moon is a province
with its own governor.

08:08.711 --> 08:10.306
You'll need me to escort you.

08:10.475 --> 08:11.993
That won't be necessary.

08:12.118 --> 08:13.518
Actually, it will.

08:13.830 --> 08:16.273
You won't make much progress
without me there,

08:16.398 --> 08:20.024
especially since you've been involved
with the death of a Concordian.

08:20.192 --> 08:21.443
I didn't kill him.

08:21.568 --> 08:22.568
I know.

08:22.841 --> 08:24.862
That's why I'm still talking to you.

08:47.636 --> 08:50.263
I thought Concordia
was an agricultural settlement.

08:50.432 --> 08:54.059
Before the end of our wars,
they turned it into a mining base.

08:54.184 --> 08:58.163
The sheer number of mining facilities
here nearly destroyed our forests.

08:58.288 --> 08:59.814
They're finally growing back.

09:18.144 --> 09:20.709
Duchess Satine,
you are most welcome.

09:20.879 --> 09:24.827
Thank you, Governor Vizsla.
May I present master Obi-Wan Kenobi,

09:24.952 --> 09:26.965
representing the Jedi Council.

09:27.135 --> 09:29.719
Governor Vizsla is one
of the officials I spoke of.

09:29.844 --> 09:32.305
He has been working to find
the members of the Death Watch.

09:32.474 --> 09:34.952
I take it you've heard
the rumors about Satine,

09:35.077 --> 09:37.456
about how she's supposedly
leading Mandalore

09:37.581 --> 09:39.520
into an alliance
with the Separatists.

09:39.688 --> 09:42.065
My only instructions
are to seek the truth.

09:42.190 --> 09:45.026
This was the man who bombed
the memorial shrine?

09:46.344 --> 09:48.613
He was apparently
part of Death Watch.

09:48.886 --> 09:50.436
A worrisome prospect.

09:50.939 --> 09:54.285
If you'll pardon me, General,
we must attend to the body.

09:57.004 --> 09:58.704
I need a favor from you.

09:58.900 --> 10:01.334
Please keep Governor Vizsla
occupied at dinner.

10:01.503 --> 10:03.003
Where are you going?

10:03.132 --> 10:04.532
Just for a look around.

10:04.657 --> 10:07.340
I'd like to see one of these
mining facilities for myself.

10:07.509 --> 10:10.801
You mean you want to determine
if they're still operational.

10:10.969 --> 10:13.069
I hope to determine they're not.

10:14.389 --> 10:17.091
I want you to wear this earpiece
so that we can stay in contact,

10:17.216 --> 10:19.894
in case you run into trouble
while I'm gone.

10:22.188 --> 10:24.873
Remember that you are here
under my protection.

10:24.998 --> 10:26.776
Please try not to cause problems

10:26.945 --> 10:28.495
where none yet exist.

10:29.738 --> 10:32.114
Think of me as searching
for solutions.

10:32.282 --> 10:35.132
I have to tell you
I'm opposed to all of this.

10:35.642 --> 10:37.892
I'd be disappointed if you weren't.

10:52.290 --> 10:53.688
Forgive me, Duchess.

10:53.813 --> 10:56.824
I'm writing a condolence letter
to the dead man's family

10:56.949 --> 10:59.558
and making arrangements for them
to retrieve his body.

10:59.726 --> 11:01.926
Of course, Governor.
Very proper.

11:02.235 --> 11:04.499
General Kenobi will join us shortly.

11:04.624 --> 11:06.963
He said he needed to meditate.

11:36.388 --> 11:38.338
Doesn't look abandoned to me.

12:02.457 --> 12:04.766
I am here on a diplomatic mission

12:04.891 --> 12:07.169
under the protection
of Duchess Satine.

12:07.294 --> 12:09.244
We do not recognize her rule.

12:22.926 --> 12:26.853
Someone is feeding misinformation
directly to the Republic Senate,

12:27.023 --> 12:30.183
saying that the Death Watch
is taking over Mandalore.

12:30.308 --> 12:32.558
Who stands to gain from these lies?

12:33.743 --> 12:35.393
Death Watch, of course.

12:35.615 --> 12:37.356
They could not engineer all this.

12:37.481 --> 12:40.931
The problem has clearly grown
much larger than we thought.

12:41.280 --> 12:44.705
And I suspect some external force
helped it along.

12:44.975 --> 12:46.240
Hard to believe.

12:46.365 --> 12:48.536
It has to be someone
at the highest level of influence

12:48.661 --> 12:50.086
among the Separatists.

12:50.255 --> 12:51.843
But why target me?

12:52.415 --> 12:54.490
You lead the council
of neutral systems.

12:54.615 --> 12:56.509
Thus, you threaten
the Separatists' goals.

12:56.807 --> 12:58.308
Take it as a compliment.

12:58.433 --> 13:01.733
Someone very powerful
is working towards your downfall.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.100
Commander wants us to sweep the area

13:18.225 --> 13:21.275
and check for any other Jedi
until he arrives.

13:21.611 --> 13:23.336
This one's harmless enough

13:23.461 --> 13:25.211
without his lightsaber.

13:25.587 --> 13:27.425
The boss will love this.

13:35.133 --> 13:38.687
General Kenobi's meditation
is taking a rather long time.

13:39.177 --> 13:40.394
You know the Jedi.

13:40.519 --> 13:42.596
They never do anything by halves.

13:42.921 --> 13:44.821
<i>Duchess, please acknowledge.</i>

13:45.350 --> 13:46.893
May I offer you another drink?

13:47.018 --> 13:48.890
Yes, certainly.

13:49.229 --> 13:52.815
<i>I'm in a bit of an awkward spot.
I'm being held by the Death Watch.</i>

13:53.285 --> 13:55.575
Sorry, Duchess.
We're out of ice.

13:56.319 --> 13:57.769
Sorry to hear that.

13:59.825 --> 14:03.050
Perhaps we should begin dinner
without General Kenobi.

14:03.175 --> 14:06.900
<i>You can track me with your comlink.
Follow it due East to my location.</i>

14:07.025 --> 14:09.540
I don't know if I can do that
at the moment.

14:09.709 --> 14:11.309
<i>It's extremely urgent.</i>

14:11.525 --> 14:13.419
Are you not feeling well, Duchess?

14:13.588 --> 14:16.380
Perhaps some fresh air
would do me good.

14:16.665 --> 14:18.515
Shall I escort you outside?

14:19.186 --> 14:21.344
<i>Take a speeder.
It's rough terrain.</i>

14:21.469 --> 14:23.619
I'll find my way.
Never fear.

14:45.745 --> 14:47.695
Yes, sir.
Start the machine.

14:48.055 --> 14:51.105
Time for the Jedi to meet
with his fatal accident.

14:51.375 --> 14:52.745
With pleasure.

15:02.805 --> 15:04.155
This is not good.

15:14.385 --> 15:15.985
Where exactly are you?

15:16.335 --> 15:19.485
Listen for the loud metallic
clanging sound.

15:19.785 --> 15:22.446
That would be the machine
about to smash me into bits.

15:36.255 --> 15:39.723
There's some kind of disturbance
at the entrance. Let's check it out.

15:46.682 --> 15:50.683
- It certainly took you long enough.
- You know, I haven't saved you yet.

15:51.405 --> 15:53.186
No need to remind me of that.

15:53.311 --> 15:54.353
Be patient.

15:54.522 --> 15:57.173
I happen to be a bit
short on patience right now.

15:59.943 --> 16:01.577
Now, let's see.
One of these.

16:03.309 --> 16:05.739
Satine, turn the machine off!

16:05.907 --> 16:07.032
I'm trying.

16:09.871 --> 16:10.871
There!

16:19.570 --> 16:20.520
Look out!

16:37.735 --> 16:39.170
For a man sworn to peace,

16:39.295 --> 16:42.645
you take an unseemly pleasure
in the injuries of others.

16:43.415 --> 16:45.310
For a woman sworn to nonviolence,

16:45.435 --> 16:48.220
you don't seem troubled that I could
have been killed back there.

16:48.345 --> 16:49.645
But you weren't.

16:50.368 --> 16:52.968
And yet I still haven't heard
any thanks.

16:53.425 --> 16:55.675
You certainly haven't changed much.

17:00.005 --> 17:02.004
This is not the way we came in.

17:02.588 --> 17:03.631
Look there.

17:03.756 --> 17:04.955
It's the Jedi.

17:18.185 --> 17:19.910
We'll have to stand and fight.

17:20.035 --> 17:21.935
Or in your case, just stand.

17:26.404 --> 17:27.904
You three, stop him.

17:52.471 --> 17:53.471
You there.

18:02.145 --> 18:03.345
I'm all right.

18:03.495 --> 18:04.790
I'll deal with this.

18:04.915 --> 18:06.568
Get to your ships and evacuate.

18:24.365 --> 18:25.365
Failure.

18:39.185 --> 18:40.185
Governor?

18:40.475 --> 18:42.810
For generations
my ancestors fought proudly

18:42.935 --> 18:44.885
as warriors against the Jedi.

18:45.245 --> 18:48.986
Now that woman tarnishes
the very name Mandalorian.

18:50.425 --> 18:52.075
Defend her if you will.

18:55.985 --> 18:59.350
This lightsaber was stolen
from your Jedi Temple

18:59.475 --> 19:02.755
by my ancestors
during the fall of the Old Republic.

19:03.435 --> 19:06.855
Since then,
many Jedi have died upon its blade.

19:07.365 --> 19:09.631
Prepare yourself to join them.

19:58.715 --> 20:00.265
Warriors, finish him!

20:24.295 --> 20:26.166
Should we go after him, sir?

20:27.075 --> 20:28.320
There's no time.

20:28.445 --> 20:29.470
Don't worry.

20:29.595 --> 20:32.345
We'll catch up with the Duchess
soon enough.

20:34.745 --> 20:36.905
I suppose we're even now.

20:37.770 --> 20:38.770
How so?

20:38.895 --> 20:41.335
I saved your life.
You saved mine.

20:43.255 --> 20:45.792
Mine was the more daring
of the two rescues.

20:54.645 --> 20:57.370
But if Pre Vizsla fled,
we have no way of learning

20:57.495 --> 21:00.395
how widespread
Death Watch really is.

21:00.995 --> 21:04.230
It's obvious the Separatists
are supporting the Death Watch.

21:04.355 --> 21:05.585
I disagree.

21:06.125 --> 21:09.425
I told you I wanted to stay
out of this conflict.

21:09.985 --> 21:12.345
Given the current situation,

21:13.175 --> 21:16.075
I'm afraid
that may no longer be possible.

21:16.775 --> 21:19.350
I thought you of all people

21:19.475 --> 21:22.455
would understand my position
on this matter.

21:22.765 --> 21:25.595
I will never be a part of this war.

21:33.285 --> 21:35.193
Reporting for escort duty, General.

21:37.055 --> 21:38.605
Am I glad to see you.

21:39.655 --> 21:40.920
You sound tired.

21:41.045 --> 21:43.095
The peaceful ways of the locals

21:43.325 --> 21:44.725
wore me out a bit.

21:45.305 --> 21:51.387
