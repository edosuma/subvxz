00:36.262 --> 00:39.613
are fun. "I Gnocchi
What You Did Last Summer"?

00:39.765 --> 00:41.064
Ooh, and a sequel dish,

00:41.066 --> 00:43.433
"I Dill Know What You Did
Last Sandwich."

00:43.527 --> 00:45.544
It seems like she gave up
halfway down.

00:45.695 --> 00:46.770
"Okay Hamburger"?

00:46.789 --> 00:48.029
Sounds delicious.

00:48.123 --> 00:49.864
Nothing is more appetizing
than honesty.

00:49.958 --> 00:50.865
-(door opens)
-Oh, look.

00:50.885 --> 00:52.109
Wolf and Honeybee are here.

00:52.202 --> 00:53.201
I hope they sit with us.

00:53.262 --> 00:54.202
JUDY: Uh, yeah, Ham.

00:54.296 --> 00:55.370
They're meeting us here.

00:55.464 --> 00:57.281
-Oh, score!
-Sorry we're late.

00:57.299 --> 00:58.465
We had car trouble...

00:58.559 --> 01:00.375
is what I would say
if I was lying.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.061
But we're late because
we were picking up

01:02.212 --> 01:03.136
that big mamma blamma.

01:03.230 --> 01:05.472
-HAM: Whoa!
-JUDY: So shiny.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.140
It's like a mini fridge
you can live inside.

01:07.234 --> 01:10.051
Oh, no. Are you moving away
for a life on the road?

01:10.071 --> 01:11.812
Please come back, son.
Please come home.

01:11.964 --> 01:13.980
Dad, relax.
I know you probably forgot

01:14.075 --> 01:15.966
because you're too humble
to celebrate yourself,

01:15.984 --> 01:18.059
but this Sunday
is my favorite holiday.

01:18.079 --> 01:19.411
Father's Day.

01:19.638 --> 01:21.638
And that memory-maker is
all ours for a full three days.

01:21.657 --> 01:23.898
-Drumroll, please, Honeybee.
-Drum sounds.

01:23.918 --> 01:26.919
Surprise.
We're all going to Family Land

01:27.146 --> 01:29.237
for the Father's Day
Festival Weekend.

01:29.331 --> 01:30.405
Uh-oh. Oh, no.

01:30.482 --> 01:32.907
I mean, um, um...
Oh, great. Let's go.

01:33.076 --> 01:35.319
Is Family Land
a land made of families?

01:35.337 --> 01:37.262
-Like a graveyard or something?
-No, Moon.

01:37.414 --> 01:39.414
Fam Land is an RV park
and the site

01:39.433 --> 01:41.658
of our most epic
Father's Day trip ever,

01:41.751 --> 01:43.769
when I was ten
and you weren't even born yet.

01:43.996 --> 01:45.829
Sadly, we had to leave early
last time

01:45.848 --> 01:47.439
because of a dingy-dangy
forest fire,

01:47.666 --> 01:49.516
but it's time
for our glorious return.

01:49.685 --> 01:50.925
I don't know, son.

01:51.019 --> 01:52.336
Maybe we should
give it a few more years.

01:52.429 --> 01:53.946
Really make sure
that fire is out.

01:54.097 --> 01:55.948
Dad, we know you don't
feel like you deserve

01:56.099 --> 01:58.024
a flashy Father's Day,
but you totally do.

01:58.177 --> 01:59.192
You're rad as hell.

01:59.286 --> 02:01.511
Ham, I was thinking
since we both love

02:01.530 --> 02:03.363
Matthew McConaughey's
RV makeover show

02:03.515 --> 02:06.441
<i> Trailure To Launch,</i> we can
try our hand at some RV rehab.

02:06.535 --> 02:09.019
Sweet. It's amazing
how a few throw pillows

02:09.112 --> 02:10.963
can take a mobile home
from trailer

02:11.156 --> 02:13.615
to "slightly nicer
than a trailer."

02:13.634 --> 02:15.876
-(groans)
-Dad, you okay?

02:16.044 --> 02:18.470
Yes. I am just so excited
I feel sick.

02:18.622 --> 02:21.698
Well, let's raise a toast
to the granddaddy of all dads:

02:21.867 --> 02:23.308
-Dad.
-Yeah!

02:32.802 --> 02:33.819
What?

02:34.062 --> 02:37.214
You know, TC, aka tow cap
aka towing capacity

02:37.383 --> 02:39.549
on your nasty boy
aka pickup truck?

02:39.568 --> 02:40.993
Oh. I don't know.

02:41.144 --> 02:41.994
Oh, totally.

02:42.163 --> 02:43.978
Well, time to sink
my slinky stinky.

02:44.072 --> 02:46.056
You know, the hose that goes
from the RV toilet

02:46.149 --> 02:47.057
into the ground.

02:47.150 --> 02:48.650
Yeah, I... Oh, uh...

02:48.669 --> 02:49.743
Cool, see you around, bud.

02:49.895 --> 02:51.837
Aw, man, everyone here
is so nice.

02:52.064 --> 02:53.730
Well, I'm gonna
go poke around the woods.

02:53.823 --> 02:55.081
Okay, but be careful, bud.

02:55.234 --> 02:57.325
You got to watch out
for those rascals.

02:57.419 --> 02:59.011
There are no skunks in Alaska.

02:59.238 --> 03:00.662
Well, turns out
they shot a straight-to-video

03:00.756 --> 03:02.739
Noah's Ark movie
with Ray Liotta nearby,

03:02.758 --> 03:05.592
and a bunch of the skunk doubles
got loose and mated like crazy.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.594
You know, like when
actors hook up on set.

03:07.746 --> 03:09.504
If you stay in character,
it's not considered cheating.

03:09.598 --> 03:11.598
I lost track
of what you were talking about,

03:11.750 --> 03:13.266
but I'll be on the lookout.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.751
(gasps)
Oh, I can feel it.

03:14.844 --> 03:16.770
This RV adventure has
"brief yet formative romance"

03:16.922 --> 03:19.756
written all over it, so
I better bust out my poetry pad

03:19.775 --> 03:21.942
and think up some rhymes
for the word "heaving."

03:22.094 --> 03:25.612
Oh, okay, how about,
uh, uh, heaving?

03:25.764 --> 03:27.039
Wolf, I just said "heaving."

03:27.266 --> 03:29.433
No bad ideas
in a brainstorm, Judy.

03:29.451 --> 03:31.785
Hey, Dad, you want to come out
and take a walk around the park?

03:31.937 --> 03:34.713
Maybe work on the father and son
strut I emailed you about?

03:34.864 --> 03:36.531
I think I'll just
stay inside here.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.217
I found this receipt
in my pocket,

03:38.368 --> 03:40.444
and I really need
to review it right away.

03:40.462 --> 03:43.947
Hmm, paper towels, $2.99.
Oh, interesting.

03:43.949 --> 03:46.800
Is it just me, or does it seem
like something's up with Dad?

03:46.952 --> 03:48.543
Well, the last time
we were here,

03:48.562 --> 03:49.728
Mom was with us.

03:49.955 --> 03:51.045
He's probably just adjusting.

03:51.139 --> 03:52.231
Ah, I bet you're right.

03:52.458 --> 03:53.548
Yeah, just gonna
give him a little time

03:53.567 --> 03:55.216
while I go check out
the lake sitch.

03:55.385 --> 03:56.401
Maybe I'll make some new friends

03:56.628 --> 03:58.979
I can do a freestyle
summer rap for.

03:59.131 --> 04:00.130
Ooh, I'll come with.

04:00.299 --> 04:01.740
Maybe my reckless fling
is over there

04:01.891 --> 04:04.159
getting a reckless sunburn.

04:05.637 --> 04:06.912
Okay, okay.

04:07.063 --> 04:10.474
Respectable stream work,
plenty of rocks. This will do.

04:10.492 --> 04:11.399
Uh-oh.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.901
Uh, sir?
I just want you to know

04:13.996 --> 04:18.148
there's no reason to spray me
because I already respect you.

04:18.241 --> 04:19.666
I mean, when you think about it,

04:19.818 --> 04:23.320
there's no reason you and I
can't be friends, right?

04:23.338 --> 04:25.672
Maybe if I give out
the right energy,

04:25.766 --> 04:27.248
then you won't spray me.

04:27.268 --> 04:29.509
Ow. Okay,
you took a little nibble.

04:29.661 --> 04:32.996
That's probably my fault.
I'm assuming I'm delicious.

04:33.015 --> 04:35.107
Then the trailer
started shaking,

04:35.276 --> 04:36.666
I thought it was a bear,

04:36.668 --> 04:38.460
but it was just Dorothy
doing her dang Zumba.

04:38.562 --> 04:39.778
(laughing)

04:39.929 --> 04:43.173
Man, Dad should really be
out here, spinning yarns

04:43.191 --> 04:44.449
and meeting
these other rad dads.

04:44.601 --> 04:46.176
Ham and I tried
to get him to come,

04:46.194 --> 04:47.935
but he said he had to swap
the laces on his boots

04:48.104 --> 04:49.846
to give them
equal wear and tear.

04:49.865 --> 04:51.123
That's weird. He usually

04:51.350 --> 04:53.350
-does his lace rotations
in winter.
-Oh.

04:53.368 --> 04:55.443
A boy my age. He noticed me.

04:55.462 --> 04:56.686
And so it begins.

04:56.780 --> 04:57.945
Oh, he's walking over.

04:58.040 --> 05:00.373
I don't know if he's my type...
Oh...

05:00.526 --> 05:01.949
(French accent):
Hello. I am Abelard.

05:01.969 --> 05:05.137
(gasps) Hello, accent!
I mean, person boy.

05:05.364 --> 05:07.255
And my name is "Joie-Dee."

05:07.308 --> 05:08.640
Uh, I'm sorry. It's Judy.

05:08.792 --> 05:11.626
Judy. What a lovely name.
Where are you visiting from?

05:11.645 --> 05:15.630
Oh. Just here.
Boring old Alaska. Blah.

05:15.724 --> 05:17.149
Where are you from, Abelard?

05:17.300 --> 05:18.558
East Hawkesbury.

05:18.635 --> 05:20.727
It is a French-speaking town
in Ontario, Canada.

05:20.804 --> 05:22.804
<i> Zou bisou bisou.</i>
(chuckles)

05:22.898 --> 05:24.656
Tell me, Abelard,
what life is like

05:24.808 --> 05:27.067
(French accent):
in East Hawkesbury, Ontario.

05:27.161 --> 05:28.976
(regular accent):
There must be, uh, I'm guessing,

05:28.996 --> 05:31.997
so many petite cafes and, uh...
like, bicycle baskets?

05:32.148 --> 05:35.058
Uh, well, there is a MacDonald,
and a Home De-peux,

05:35.077 --> 05:37.410
-and a Boston Marche.
-Ooh, la, la.

05:37.563 --> 05:39.671
Hey, Elwin.
How about a scary story?

05:39.898 --> 05:40.672
-(whooping)
-Yeah.

05:40.899 --> 05:42.232
Okay, quiet down, everybody.

05:42.250 --> 05:43.375
If you have little ones,

05:43.527 --> 05:45.068
you might want to take them
to bed,

05:45.087 --> 05:46.828
for I am about
to tell you a story

05:46.922 --> 05:48.996
that will chill you
to the bone marrow!

05:49.016 --> 05:50.849
Ooh, a scary tale.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Perhaps we should
hold the hands?

05:53.095 --> 05:54.669
Yeah, well, my hand's
a little sweaty.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.170
But you know what they say:

05:56.190 --> 05:58.190
"damp hands, wet heart."

05:58.417 --> 05:59.766
It was Sunday skit night,

05:59.918 --> 06:02.694
and it was the most important
skit night of the season:

06:02.771 --> 06:04.254
The Father's Day Follies.

06:04.347 --> 06:06.590
<i> After a wonderful evening</i>
<i> of light entertainment,</i>

06:06.608 --> 06:08.533
<i> the families returned</i>
<i> to their trailers,</i>

06:08.726 --> 06:10.351
<i> and that's when he struck.</i>

06:10.371 --> 06:11.778
<i> The Fiend of Family Land.</i>

06:11.872 --> 06:13.780
<i>The Fiend dropped a firecracker</i>

06:13.949 --> 06:16.190
<i> down a septic tank,</i>
<i>and it set off a chain reaction.</i>

06:16.210 --> 06:19.769
<i> First, one septic tank blew.</i>
<i> Boom! And then another. Boom!</i>

06:19.788 --> 06:23.048
<i> And then another. Boom!</i>
<i> And then another! Boom!</i>

06:23.199 --> 06:25.050
<i> Luckily, everyone's</i>
<i> trailers survived,</i>

06:25.085 --> 06:26.718
<i> but the Fiend created</i>
<i> a stink so bad</i>

06:26.870 --> 06:29.946
<i> Family Land was condemned</i>
<i> for the rest of the summer.</i>

06:29.965 --> 06:31.890
My wife Dorothy and I
had to spend

06:31.967 --> 06:34.968
the rest of the season
at Family World.

06:35.120 --> 06:37.120
Yeah, my husband divorced me
after the incident.

06:37.213 --> 06:38.304
It was unrelated,

06:38.399 --> 06:39.564
but I still associate
the memories,

06:39.716 --> 06:40.732
and it's traumatic.

06:40.959 --> 06:42.717
The Fiend was a tall,
red-bearded man,

06:42.736 --> 06:45.070
and we've never seen him
since he fled that night,

06:45.297 --> 06:46.630
taking his three kids

06:46.723 --> 06:48.222
and his beautiful
blonde wife with him.

06:48.242 --> 06:51.985
Red beard, three kids,
gorgeous blonde wife?

06:52.137 --> 06:53.578
It can't be.

06:54.415 --> 06:57.416
Oh, hello. I was just
reading my receipt again.

06:57.567 --> 06:58.808
How was the bonfire?

06:58.902 --> 07:02.087
Are you asking that
as my dad or as... as...

07:02.238 --> 07:03.163
As what, son?

07:03.482 --> 07:05.815
The Fiend, Beef?
The Fiend of Family Land?

07:05.834 --> 07:08.985
(sighs) Yes, I am.
I am the Fiend.

07:09.004 --> 07:12.222
Papa Do Fiend,
and we're in trouble deep.

07:15.160 --> 07:18.662
It's all true. I exploded
the septic tanks. (sighs)

07:18.680 --> 07:21.014
You see, the last time
we came to this park,

07:21.166 --> 07:23.275
instead of being in
a Father's Day Follies skit

07:23.426 --> 07:26.503
with her family, your mother
decided to perform in a skit

07:26.596 --> 07:28.262
<i> with three handsome men</i>
<i> from Montana.</i>

07:28.356 --> 07:31.508
<i> The skit was an alternative</i>
<i> version of Annie.</i>

07:31.601 --> 07:33.618
<i> Your mother played</i>
<i> Daddy Warbucks,</i>

07:33.770 --> 07:35.028
<i> but in a bikini.</i>

07:35.180 --> 07:37.271
<i> Even though I was</i>
<i> disappointed, I thought</i>

07:37.291 --> 07:38.623
<i> we would celebrate afterwards</i>

07:38.850 --> 07:40.125
<i>with some Father's Day cupcakes,</i>

07:40.160 --> 07:43.369
but Kathleen said it was
customary to go out for drinks

07:43.522 --> 07:45.613
with the cast and crew
after the show.

07:45.707 --> 07:47.782
<i> Which meant she went</i>
<i> to her costars' RV</i>

07:47.801 --> 07:49.693
<i> to hang out and drink Zimas.</i>

07:49.711 --> 07:50.952
And on that Father's Day night,

07:50.971 --> 07:52.804
I could hear them
jesting and laughing.

07:53.031 --> 07:56.123
I swear they were listening
to some kind of circus music.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.793
<i> I just wanted to get her</i>
<i> out of there and remind her</i>

07:58.812 --> 08:00.479
<i> of all the beautiful things</i>
<i> we had together,</i>

08:00.630 --> 08:02.222
<i> like our kids,</i>
<i> and the waffle maker.</i>

08:02.316 --> 08:04.149
<i> I had brought some sparklers</i>
<i> along on the trip</i>

08:04.376 --> 08:07.319
<i> because Wolf was really into</i>
<i> sparkler dancing at the time.</i>

08:07.470 --> 08:09.562
I was pretty good.
Wish I would have stuck with it.

08:09.715 --> 08:11.715
<i> I thought I could</i>
<i> do my own sparkler dance</i>

08:11.733 --> 08:14.308
<i> outside the Montanan's trailer</i>
<i> to get Kathleen's attention.</i>

08:14.328 --> 08:15.902
<i> HONEYBEE:</i>
<i> Oh, Beef, no.</i>

08:15.996 --> 08:17.829
<i> Yes. And by God, I sparkled.</i>

08:17.981 --> 08:20.147
<i> I sparkled to beat the band.</i>

08:20.242 --> 08:21.666
<i> But then, I accidentally</i>

08:21.818 --> 08:24.394
<i> flung a sparkler down</i>
<i>the Montanans' open septic tank.</i>

08:24.487 --> 08:28.990
<i> It then caused every septic</i>
<i> tank in the park to blow up.</i>

08:29.009 --> 08:29.991
Dear God.

08:30.068 --> 08:31.826
<i> And a stink like I have never</i>

08:31.920 --> 08:34.012
<i> smelled before or since</i>
<i> covered the park</i>

08:34.163 --> 08:36.906
<i> like a bedsheet soiled</i>
<i> by the devil himself.</i>

08:36.925 --> 08:39.851
<i> It was then that I was spotted</i>
<i> by many of the people</i>

08:40.078 --> 08:41.502
<i> who still summer here</i>
<i> to this day.</i>

08:41.522 --> 08:43.855
There's the culprit.
Fiend! Get him.

08:44.082 --> 08:45.765
<i> So I grabbed Kathleen</i>
<i> and we made a run for it.</i>

08:45.859 --> 08:47.100
<i> She found the whole thing</i>

08:47.252 --> 08:49.861
so exciting that later
that evening we shared--

08:50.088 --> 08:51.863
and I'm sorry
to be so explicit--

08:52.090 --> 08:53.439
a special moment together.

08:53.534 --> 08:56.442
And exactly nine months later,
Moon was born.

08:56.595 --> 08:57.427
You're welcome.

08:57.520 --> 08:58.428
<i> I told you kids</i>

08:58.446 --> 08:59.871
<i>there was a looming forest fire</i>

09:00.023 --> 09:00.872
<i> and we had to go,</i>

09:01.024 --> 09:02.874
<i> but there was no forest fire.</i>

09:03.101 --> 09:04.267
<i> Just a log fire.</i>

09:04.286 --> 09:05.877
Logs of human excrement.

09:06.104 --> 09:08.195
-Hmm. A fire-arrhea.
-Indeed.

09:08.290 --> 09:10.790
Once again, I have to say
what no one else is willing to:

09:10.884 --> 09:11.699
Yuck.

09:11.835 --> 09:13.367
So I've been hiding in here

09:13.461 --> 09:16.296
because I'm afraid of what
people would say if they saw me.

09:16.464 --> 09:17.538
I'm so sorry, Dad.

09:17.632 --> 09:19.115
I can't believe
I made us come back here.

09:19.208 --> 09:22.227
And now that holiest
of parent-themed days is ruined.

09:22.378 --> 09:23.970
I guess I'm the real fiend.

09:24.122 --> 09:25.972
The fiend of frigging
Father's Day.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.732
No, son.
If you guys are having fun,

09:27.959 --> 09:30.384
then that's the best Father's
Day gift you could give me.

09:30.462 --> 09:32.904
I'll have a good time in here
helping Ham and Honeybee

09:33.131 --> 09:35.222
take this trailer
from "okay for now"

09:35.242 --> 09:36.983
to "hey, it's a wow."

09:37.135 --> 09:38.559
Then I did a cannonball,
and this one kid

09:38.653 --> 09:40.153
couldn't believe
how much water I splashed.

09:40.229 --> 09:42.247
And I was like,
"I can do way more than that."

09:42.398 --> 09:43.823
And he was like, "No way."

09:43.917 --> 09:45.325
So then I did a side flop,

09:45.477 --> 09:46.567
and I doubled my splash zone.

09:46.661 --> 09:47.902
That's why my side is so red.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.254
Are you sure you
don't want to come out

09:49.481 --> 09:50.980
for the Dads Dive Competition?

09:50.999 --> 09:52.406
Oh, no, I'm afraid, for me,

09:52.500 --> 09:54.426
it would be
a Dads Die competition,

09:54.653 --> 09:56.669
because of how I'd be drowned
by an angry mob.

09:56.763 --> 09:59.431
Okay. Well, look out
at the pool in three minutes.

09:59.658 --> 10:02.492
Special Father's Day
face flop just for you.

10:02.510 --> 10:05.678
I brought you something from
the<i> distributeur automatique.</i>

10:05.772 --> 10:08.331
Is it a necklace?
Oh, flaming hot corn bits.

10:08.350 --> 10:10.442
Pepe le Please and thank you.

10:10.593 --> 10:14.261
So, what's the art scene like
in Hawkesbury-- transporting?

10:14.281 --> 10:17.006
Uh, well, my uncle
paints tractors.

10:17.100 --> 10:19.342
Your uncle paints
paintings of tractors?

10:19.361 --> 10:21.119
What a humble, gorgeous subject.

10:21.196 --> 10:23.622
Does he show in a gallery?

10:24.866 --> 10:26.458
I had a great time, Abelard.

10:26.627 --> 10:27.942
I would like to invite you

10:27.961 --> 10:29.811
to dinner at my family's
mobile home tomorrow.

10:29.813 --> 10:32.446
Will your family mind
that I don't speak<i> francais?</i>

10:32.466 --> 10:36.468
They will like you very much
because I like you very much.

10:36.619 --> 10:37.543
-Mwah.
-Mwah.

10:37.696 --> 10:38.695
<i> Alors, à plus tard.</i>

10:38.713 --> 10:39.879
Cinnabon.

10:40.031 --> 10:41.640
HAM:
Now, I brought a few of our

10:41.791 --> 10:43.199
tiny German figurines from home

10:43.218 --> 10:44.534
to make the space more personal.

10:44.536 --> 10:46.794
But I'm just bamboozled
where to put them.

10:46.872 --> 10:48.037
You guys got any good ideas?

10:48.131 --> 10:50.707
What if we put Brunhelga
up on the sill

10:50.725 --> 10:53.376
and little Pietr hiding
in a beer stein near the sink?

10:53.395 --> 10:55.469
BEEF:
May I be frank? That's stunning.

10:55.563 --> 10:57.547
Ah, my two youngest
have returned.

10:57.640 --> 10:58.490
We can have dinner now.

10:58.641 --> 11:00.307
So, what did you all
get up to today?

11:00.327 --> 11:02.494
I met a French boy from Canada
and I'm having dinner

11:02.721 --> 11:05.221
with his family tomorrow
before the Father's Day Follies.

11:05.240 --> 11:07.223
I also made a new friend.
William.

11:07.225 --> 11:08.667
William?
He's not a grown-up, is he?

11:08.818 --> 11:11.895
I'm guessing from his teeth
that William is about four.

11:11.988 --> 11:13.338
Now, this is
a no-judgement zone,

11:13.565 --> 11:16.566
but there is a very terrible
BO smell filling this trailer,

11:16.659 --> 11:18.584
and it seems to be coming
from Dad's general vicinity.

11:18.661 --> 11:21.662
Oh, uh, yes.
I've been cooped up all day,

11:21.682 --> 11:24.757
so that indeed is the O of my B.

11:24.910 --> 11:27.519
Once night falls, we'll
sneak you out to the shower.

11:27.670 --> 11:28.687
You know what they say,

11:28.914 --> 11:30.355
"You're never too old
to bathe your Dad."

11:30.582 --> 11:31.764
Sweetie, no.

11:31.917 --> 11:33.099
BEEF:
Almost done, son.

11:33.251 --> 11:35.360
Just finishing up
with the southern cheek area.

11:35.511 --> 11:36.586
Oh, no.

11:36.679 --> 11:39.197
Uh, uh, good evening, there,
Mister Kreb.

11:39.348 --> 11:40.590
what brings you to the showers?

11:40.683 --> 11:42.183
Gonna take a shower.

11:42.260 --> 11:43.760
Very cool, but there's only one,

11:43.929 --> 11:45.352
and it appears to be occupied.

11:45.447 --> 11:47.354
Okay. I'll stand here and wait.

11:47.490 --> 11:48.522
Perfect.
Uh, so,

11:48.616 --> 11:50.116
whoever is in there
should just dry off

11:50.268 --> 11:52.377
and then probably use the towel
to cover his face

11:52.528 --> 11:56.773
as he exits, and...
allow me to guide you, stranger.

11:56.866 --> 11:59.459
That beard.
That height.

11:59.611 --> 12:00.719
It's...

12:00.795 --> 12:02.870
the Fiend! He returns!

12:02.889 --> 12:04.705
Run, Dad!
Run like a fiend!

12:04.725 --> 12:06.707
I mean, uh, not a fiend,
because he's not the Fiend.

12:06.727 --> 12:08.268
Oh, no, his robe fell off.

12:11.231 --> 12:14.140
Well, now that all the citizens
of Family Land

12:14.292 --> 12:15.716
got a chance
to yell at Dad a lot last night,

12:15.736 --> 12:18.219
they can spend today
getting to know the real Dad,

12:18.296 --> 12:19.386
and the healing can begin.

12:19.481 --> 12:20.721
I hope you're right, son.

12:20.741 --> 12:22.741
It's a great time to try,
cause there's a ton

12:22.968 --> 12:24.150
of Father's Day spirit
in the air.

12:24.302 --> 12:26.319
And, to help you out,
we're launching a pro-dad

12:26.471 --> 12:28.304
guerilla-style marketing
campaign in the park.

12:28.323 --> 12:31.750
Like Wendy's Twitter rap battle
with Wingstop. Everybody won.

12:31.901 --> 12:35.161
Hey, did you hear about this
supposed Fiend of Family Land?

12:35.330 --> 12:37.422
I heard he's actually rad,
through and through.

12:37.649 --> 12:41.000
Maybe they should start calling
him the Friend of Family Land.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.744
Well, this poster certainly
seems worth considering.

12:43.764 --> 12:47.340
I heard that Fiend guy-- he did
a triple flip into the pool.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.675
He did? You know what?
I forgive him.

12:49.828 --> 12:52.086
Guys, I don't think
anyone is listening to us.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.846
Nope. Not one person.

12:53.999 --> 12:57.500
Thanks for introducing me to
your friends. Mike seems cool.

12:57.593 --> 12:59.760
You know, William,
I was thinking about us,

12:59.780 --> 13:02.171

14:15.096 --> 14:17.021
one of them being that
everyone still hates you.

14:17.173 --> 14:18.339
I'd know if I'd say hate.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.691
MAN:
We literally hate you, Fiend.

14:19.918 --> 14:21.359
HONEYBEE:
Guys, let's just leave.

14:21.586 --> 14:23.269
We can be eating nachos
in our own kitchen by bedtime.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.938
No. I can't
leave things like this.

14:26.032 --> 14:29.275
I am a fiend for not
making it right all these years.

14:29.444 --> 14:31.094
And even though
it makes me very nervous

14:31.112 --> 14:33.037
to stand in front
of people and talk,

14:33.264 --> 14:35.189
I will go right now
to sign myself up

14:35.358 --> 14:36.541
for the Father's Day Follies

14:36.692 --> 14:39.711
and use my time
to make a sincere apology.

14:39.862 --> 14:43.272
Aw, we can't let this happen.
Dad is a wack public speaker.

14:43.366 --> 14:46.275
Remember when he tried to make
a suggestion at the PTA meeting

14:46.294 --> 14:48.052
and all he could make
were Frankenstein noises?

14:48.279 --> 14:50.871
Oh, yeah, the school nurse
had to give him a sedative.

14:50.891 --> 14:52.782
You guys spruced up this RV,

14:52.917 --> 14:55.301
and now it's time
to spruce up our VD.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.453
I'm talking about
our vibrant Dad.

14:57.472 --> 15:00.806
And I'm talking about performing
a little folly of our own.

15:00.959 --> 15:02.233
Siblings, let's skit.

15:02.460 --> 15:06.053
Oh, I'm in. I'll just bring
my le date le Abelard

15:06.131 --> 15:07.554
after we've had le dinner

15:07.574 --> 15:11.725
and, uh... bonjour,
and voilà, and...<i> fini.</i>

15:11.745 --> 15:13.060
Okay, Judy,

15:13.304 --> 15:15.896
you are about to enter the world
of French sophistication.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.231
What's it gonna
be like in there?

15:17.400 --> 15:19.825
I agree, Camus is the most
important novelist

15:19.978 --> 15:22.420
-of the 20th century.
<i> -Oui, oui, oui.</i>
<i> -Oui, oui,</i> monsieur.

15:22.571 --> 15:24.047
Ooh, la, la.

15:24.758 --> 15:25.757
ABELARD:
<i> Entrer.</i>

15:25.984 --> 15:27.500
-Bonjour. Bonj...
-(laughing)

15:27.652 --> 15:28.651
Okay, okay. Well.

15:28.653 --> 15:29.819
Oh... Okay.

15:29.912 --> 15:31.821
Judy, this is my Mom,
Chardonnay,

15:31.914 --> 15:34.323
and my brothers
Martin, Hugo, and Doug.

15:34.342 --> 15:36.842
-Hello.
<i> -Allô.</i> Would you like
a glass of spaghetti?

15:36.995 --> 15:39.312
-Nipple pinch.
-Ow! (speaks French)

15:41.257 --> 15:43.090
Join me on the dinner couch.

15:43.109 --> 15:44.776
-Abelard, qu'est-ce que c'est?
<i> -Quoi?</i>

15:45.003 --> 15:47.019
-(farts)
-(laughs) Got me.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.005
Now I will fart
on your girlfriend.

15:49.023 --> 15:51.765
Oh. No. No, no, no. No. No.

15:51.785 --> 15:53.843
-(growling)
-Becky, be nice.

15:53.861 --> 15:56.679
There's enough garbage from
the compost can for all of you.

15:56.698 --> 16:00.183
I wish the people at the RV park
could see you guys like this.

16:00.276 --> 16:01.459
They would love you.

16:01.610 --> 16:05.037
Yeah.
They would absolutely love you.

16:05.131 --> 16:06.447
-Aah!
-(farting)

16:06.541 --> 16:09.709
-(sighs) I'll see myself le out.
-(Abelard laughing)

16:09.861 --> 16:12.195
Judy, where are you going?

16:12.213 --> 16:14.030
The dinner was going so well.

16:14.123 --> 16:15.548
Was it?
I mean, look, Abelard.

16:15.700 --> 16:17.291
I love farts
as much as the next guy,

16:17.310 --> 16:20.144
but I thought tonight was gonna
be more like, you know, a date.

16:20.221 --> 16:22.796
With mimes and wine
and cheese and stuff.

16:22.890 --> 16:24.148
So, I'm just gonna head out.

16:24.375 --> 16:26.300
But don't you want to see
who wins the fart battle?

16:26.319 --> 16:30.304
(chuckles) Oh, Abelard,
I know who wins the fart battle.

16:30.398 --> 16:31.564
Surprise.

16:31.658 --> 16:34.217
-(farts)
<i> -C'est moi.</i>

16:34.235 --> 16:36.886
♪<i> Ice, ice, yeah, baby</i> ♪

16:36.888 --> 16:38.738
BUNNY:
Get out of here, Fiend!

16:38.890 --> 16:40.331
Thank you for the fine can.

16:40.558 --> 16:43.559
The Heath Family.
Is everyone enjoying

16:43.578 --> 16:45.486
the Family Land
Father's Day Follies?

16:45.580 --> 16:48.322
Where have you been?
It's almost time.

16:48.416 --> 16:49.340
Living. Loving.

16:49.492 --> 16:50.733
(sighs)
Loss-ing.

16:50.902 --> 16:53.753
Next up is... Oh, dear.
He signed up as Beef Tobin,

16:53.847 --> 16:56.330
but we all know him
as The Fiend.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.349
His act is called
"Apology Speech."

16:58.501 --> 17:00.760
Well, here it goes.
I threw up five times,

17:00.912 --> 17:02.261
so I should
be pretty well empty.

17:02.413 --> 17:06.173
Dad, you can sit back down.
Because your kids have this.

17:06.267 --> 17:07.859
Siblings, it's skit time.

17:08.010 --> 17:09.193
Oh, thank God.

17:09.362 --> 17:12.012
-People of Family Land.
-MAN: You suck, Fiend Family!

17:12.032 --> 17:13.698
Great throw, sir.
Loving the boot.

17:13.925 --> 17:16.517
All right, now, if you could
all just sit back and relax,

17:16.536 --> 17:18.594
we now present
our sketch, called

17:18.613 --> 17:21.447
"From Fiend to Friend:
A Redemption Story."

17:21.599 --> 17:23.541
WOMAN:
That title is presumptuous!

17:26.454 --> 17:29.863
"From Fiend to Friend," Act One.
Well, there's just one act.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.957
I now take you back in time.

17:32.052 --> 17:34.277
Bleep bloop blarp.
Time travel noises.

17:34.295 --> 17:36.203
Night had fallen,
and I couldn't sleep.

17:36.222 --> 17:38.705
I had recently seen
the cinematic masterpiece

17:38.800 --> 17:40.541
by M. Night Shyamalan<i> Signs,</i>

17:40.635 --> 17:43.061
and I was convinced
the aliens were a-comin'.

17:43.212 --> 17:44.303
Papa, I'm scared.

17:44.397 --> 17:47.381
Wolf, there's nothing
to be scared of.

17:47.475 --> 17:50.050
The only place I felt safe
was on the water.

17:50.128 --> 17:51.235
Because the aliens in the movie

17:51.462 --> 17:52.311
couldn't touch water
or they'd die.

17:52.463 --> 17:53.762
Perfect script.

17:53.815 --> 17:56.299
Anyways, when I came home
from school the next day,

17:56.392 --> 17:58.225
my father had used
some spare lumber

17:58.319 --> 18:00.060
to transform my bed into a boat.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.412
And, audience,
from that day forward

18:01.564 --> 18:03.973
I sailed that beautiful
sleep ship

18:04.066 --> 18:05.732
right off to dreamland
every night.

18:05.827 --> 18:08.920
Until I saw<i> Ghost Ship</i>
and Dad had to make my boat bed

18:09.147 --> 18:11.089
back into a real bed,
but you get the idea.

18:11.240 --> 18:14.667
And now we go "bork bop"
to five years ago.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.986
Father, I'm gay.

18:17.004 --> 18:19.413
Wonderful.
I love you, son.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.081
Dad, that was supposed
to be my line.

18:21.175 --> 18:24.510
But it is wonderful.
And I do love you, son.

18:24.604 --> 18:25.770
Thanks, Dad.

18:25.997 --> 18:27.588
Buckle up, time travelers.
Blorp blap.

18:27.756 --> 18:31.016
We're back in our own time,
right here at Family Land.

18:31.093 --> 18:32.777
When my dad dropped
the ding-dang sparkler

18:33.004 --> 18:35.171
down the septic tank,
he was stressed,

18:35.264 --> 18:36.614
trying to keep
our family together.

18:36.765 --> 18:39.342
Now, I know he turned this place
into a stink-scape,

18:39.510 --> 18:41.935
but he would never
intentionally blow up anything.

18:42.029 --> 18:44.847
Except our hearts with love,
not feces.

18:44.940 --> 18:46.773
-JUDY: We love you, Dad.
-HAM: We love you, Dad.
-HONEYBEE: Thanks, Beef.

18:46.868 --> 18:48.351
-(applause)
-Well,

18:48.369 --> 18:51.078
no one has harbored hatred
for the Fiend quite like me.

18:51.189 --> 18:54.206
I was mad that he ruined
one of my own Father's Days.

18:54.359 --> 18:57.710
But maybe it's time
to let be-gones be be-gones.

18:57.804 --> 19:02.381
Fiend, welcome back
into the family of Family Land.

19:02.533 --> 19:05.309
Thank you.
Thank you, Family Land.

19:05.461 --> 19:06.811
Okay, everybody.

19:06.962 --> 19:09.872
Uh, appears we have a late
entry into the follies tonight.

19:09.891 --> 19:12.875
This next skit
is by Moon Tobin, called

19:12.894 --> 19:14.635
"An Evening with
Moon and Friends."

19:14.654 --> 19:17.062
-(applause)
-Hello, I want to introduce you

19:17.157 --> 19:19.548
-to some of my friends.
-(man gasps)

19:19.567 --> 19:21.475
-Oh, and please, remain calm.
-Aah!
-Aah!

19:21.494 --> 19:23.477
-Skunks!
-No! You misunderstood,

19:23.496 --> 19:26.405
-I said to remain calm!
-(shouting)

19:26.482 --> 19:28.315
Get 'em with the light, boys!

19:28.409 --> 19:29.892
Skunks hate bright lights.

19:29.911 --> 19:31.252
Aah!

19:32.897 --> 19:35.548
Oh, no.
It's happening again.

19:37.919 --> 19:40.736
Being, uh,
awful quiet there, Dad.

19:40.905 --> 19:42.588
-You, uh, mad?
-Mm.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.016
Sorry if I ruined your
already not-so-great

19:45.167 --> 19:47.226
Father's Day
with my skunk stunt.

19:48.021 --> 19:49.078
(Beef chuckles)

19:49.096 --> 19:51.272
(laughing)

19:52.750 --> 19:54.083
Dad, you laughing?

19:54.176 --> 19:55.860
You okay there, bud?

19:56.087 --> 19:57.695
No, it's just...
it was very funny

19:57.922 --> 19:59.864
when Moon let the skunks loose
and everybody ran.

20:00.015 --> 20:02.033
And the toilet holes exploded.

20:02.202 --> 20:04.093
And why are the septic tanks

20:04.186 --> 20:05.870
always uncovered
at that place anyway?

20:06.097 --> 20:08.539
Yeah. Cover up your
stink tanks, Family Land.

20:08.766 --> 20:11.191
It's kind of exciting
to be the outlaws for once

20:11.211 --> 20:13.044
instead of a bunch
of Wholesome Harrys.

20:13.271 --> 20:17.048
We're like the bad boys of
the Southwest Alaska RV scene.

20:17.233 --> 20:19.275
No one's hated a family
this much since the Klumps.

20:19.293 --> 20:21.552
So, Dad, we didn't
ruin your Father's Day?

20:21.779 --> 20:25.556
No. It was a very memorable
Father's Day weekend.

20:25.783 --> 20:26.873
And I am a fiend.

20:26.926 --> 20:30.377
A fiend for parenting.
A real P fiend.

20:30.471 --> 20:31.470
Not what that means.

20:31.564 --> 20:34.047
Hell, yeah, Dad.
You're a total P hound.

20:34.141 --> 20:35.474
And that's not what that means.

20:35.626 --> 20:38.569
(sniffing) Oh, my God,
what is that smell?

20:38.646 --> 20:40.980
I don't know,
but completely unrelated,

20:41.132 --> 20:42.389
don't open my duffel bag.

20:42.483 --> 20:45.076
And also unrelated,
what's a better pet name--

20:45.227 --> 20:47.486
Skunky Brewster or Spray Romano?

20:47.638 --> 20:50.248
Uh-oh, the skunk I don't have
just chewed his way

20:50.475 --> 20:51.898
-out of the bag.
-(all exclaiming)

20:52.067 --> 20:53.309
-HONEYBEE: Beef, pull over.
-WOLF: Dad, pull over.

20:53.311 --> 20:54.460
BEEF:
Yup. Pullin' over.
