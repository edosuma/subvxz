WEBVTT

00:12.000 --> 00:15.833
(Meredith) IN THE O.R.,
TIME LOSES ALL MEANING.

00:15.867 --> 00:17.767
IN THE MIDST OF SUTURES
AND SAVING LIVES,

00:17.800 --> 00:19.833
THE CLOCK CEASES TO MATTER.

00:19.867 --> 00:22.833
15 MINUTES, 15 HOURS...

00:22.867 --> 00:25.167
INSIDE THE O.R.,

00:25.200 --> 00:27.433
THE BEST SURGEONS
MAKE TIME FLY.

00:27.467 --> 00:29.367
***

00:29.400 --> 00:32.100
OUTSIDE THE O.R., HOWEVER,

00:32.133 --> 00:35.800
TIME TAKES PLEASURE
IN KICKING OUR ASSES.

00:35.833 --> 00:37.700
***

00:37.733 --> 00:41.633
FOR EVEN THE STRONGEST OF US,
IT SEEMS TO PLAY TRICKS--

00:41.667 --> 00:47.533
SLOWING DOWN, HOVERING...

00:47.567 --> 00:51.400
UNTIL IT FREEZES...

00:51.433 --> 00:54.167
LEAVING US STUCK IN A MOMENT,

00:54.200 --> 00:59.067
UNABLE TO MOVE
IN ONE DIRECTION OR THE OTHER.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.833
(Alex) IZZIE. IZZIE.

01:00.867 --> 01:02.700
COME ON.

01:02.733 --> 01:05.667
(George sighs) OKAY,
SHE'S BEEN IN THERE ALL NIGHT.

01:05.700 --> 01:07.067
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.
YEAH.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.533
(Meredith) YEAH.
YEAH.

01:08.567 --> 01:10.400
WHY ARE YOU ALL
LOOKING AT ME?

01:10.433 --> 01:13.167
WELL, THIS IS FAMILIAR
TERRITORY FOR YOU.

01:13.200 --> 01:15.100
THERE IS NOTHING FAMILIAR
ABOUT THIS.

01:15.133 --> 01:17.200
UNFAMILIAR. DENNY DIED.

01:17.233 --> 01:18.733
THE MAN SHE LOVES DIED.

01:18.767 --> 01:21.133
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE ALL
DARK AND TWISTY INSIDE.

01:21.167 --> 01:23.067
"DARK AND TWISTY"?

01:23.100 --> 01:24.833
THE MOTHER WITH
THE ALZHEIMER'S THING

01:24.867 --> 01:26.433
AND THE FATHER
YOU DON'T TALK TO.
AND THE TEQUILA THING

01:26.467 --> 01:29.467
AND THE INAPPROPRIATE MEN
THING.
YOU ARE DARK AND TWISTY
INSIDE, MEREDITH,

01:29.500 --> 01:31.400
AND NOW IZZIE IS
DARK AND TWISTY INSIDE.

01:31.433 --> 01:33.233
SO ALL OF A SUDDEN
I'M THE PRESIDENT

01:33.267 --> 01:35.333
OF PEOPLE WITH CRAPPY LIVES?
SERIOUSLY,
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

01:35.367 --> 01:37.533
SOMEONE HAS TO GO IN THERE.

01:42.300 --> 01:44.200
(Richard) THE SEVEN YEARS
YOU SPEND

01:44.233 --> 01:46.100
AS A SURGICAL RESIDENT

01:46.133 --> 01:49.167
WILL BE THE BEST
AND WORST OF YOUR LIFE.

01:49.200 --> 01:51.700
LOOK AROUND YOU.

01:51.733 --> 01:54.433
SAY HELLO
TO YOUR COMPETITION.

01:54.467 --> 01:56.367
(clock ticks)

01:56.400 --> 01:58.333
HI. IZZIE STEVENS.
WASHINGTON.

01:58.367 --> 02:00.500
HEY. ALEX KAREV. IOWA.

02:00.533 --> 02:02.233
THIS IS NICE, RIGHT?

02:02.267 --> 02:04.400
THEY THREW A MIXER
FOR THE NEW INTERNS.
YEAH. (chuckles)

02:04.433 --> 02:07.300
IT'S JUST AN EXCUSE TO GET US
ALL HAPPY AND DRUNK

02:07.333 --> 02:09.267
BEFORE THEY TORTURE US.
(laughs)

02:09.300 --> 02:11.733
WHAT PROGRAM ARE YOU IN?
SURGERY.

02:11.767 --> 02:13.700
SERIOUSLY?

02:13.733 --> 02:15.567
SERIOUSLY.

02:15.600 --> 02:16.800
WHAT?

02:16.833 --> 02:19.500
I-I PICKED YOU FOR GYNIE
OR PEDS OR SOMETHING.

02:19.533 --> 02:21.433
YOU DON'T THINK
I CAN BE A SURGEON?

02:21.467 --> 02:22.600
I CAN BE A SURGEON.

02:22.633 --> 02:25.300
SURGERY'S HARD-CORE.
I'M HARD-CORE.

02:25.333 --> 02:27.733
YOU WON'T LAST
THE FIRST YEAR, BABE.

02:27.767 --> 02:30.100
(clock ticks)
(George) HEY, IZZIE.

02:30.133 --> 02:31.100
WHAT?

02:31.133 --> 02:33.233
MAYBE YOU SHOULD...

02:33.267 --> 02:35.733
CH-CHANGE YOUR CLOTHES.

02:35.767 --> 02:38.400
MAYBE YOU'D WANT TO WEAR
SOMETHING MORE COMFORTABLE.

02:38.433 --> 02:39.600
STOP IT.

02:39.633 --> 02:41.467
I KNOW. IZZIE--

02:41.500 --> 02:43.133
STOP IT. I MEAN IT.

02:43.167 --> 02:45.267
STOP... TALKING.

02:45.300 --> 02:47.300
THERE IS NOTHING
TO TALK ABOUT.

02:47.333 --> 02:48.833
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

02:48.867 --> 02:52.133
THERE IS NOTHING TO DISCUSS.

02:56.600 --> 02:59.067
I'M SO SORRY.

03:01.667 --> 03:03.567
YEAH.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.600
YEAH, ME, TOO.

03:12.167 --> 03:13.500
(man) SO YOU'RE A SURGEON.

03:13.533 --> 03:15.133
YES.

03:15.167 --> 03:17.100
USUALLY THEY DON'T SEND
A SURGEON FOR THIS.

03:17.133 --> 03:19.600
WHAT--WHAT DO WE NEED TO--
HOW DO I DO THIS?

03:19.633 --> 03:22.433
HOW DO WE DO THIS?
YOU JUST GOTTA I.D. THE BODY

03:22.467 --> 03:24.500
BEFORE I TAKE HIM
TO THE FUNERAL HOME...

03:24.533 --> 03:26.433
SO I DON'T TAKE
THE WRONG GUY.
THAT HAPPENS?

03:26.467 --> 03:27.633
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE

03:27.667 --> 03:29.600
HOW MANY TIMES
I TAKE THE WRONG GUY.

03:38.267 --> 03:41.767
TH-THAT'S HIM.
THAT'S... DENNY DUQUETTE.

03:41.800 --> 03:44.100
(man) GREAT. LOAD HIM UP.

03:44.133 --> 03:47.633
AND SIGN.

03:47.667 --> 03:49.667
WHEN'S THE FUNERAL?
NO FUNERAL.

03:49.700 --> 03:52.600
THE FAMILY ASKED TO HAVE
THE BODY SENT TO MEMPHIS.

03:57.233 --> 04:00.067
UH, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

04:03.767 --> 04:07.067
I'M SORRY.

04:07.067 --> 04:09.667
I'M SO SORRY.

04:12.067 --> 04:14.267
(ferry horn blows)

04:16.367 --> 04:17.467
WHY ARE WE
MAKING SANDWICHES AGAIN?

04:17.500 --> 04:19.200
IT'S WHAT YOU DO
WHEN SOMEONE DIES. YOU COOK.

04:19.233 --> 04:22.100
YEAH, I-I KNOW WHAT TO DO
WHEN SOMEONE DIES.

04:22.133 --> 04:25.167
I AM A JEW.
I KNOW FOOD AND DEATH.

04:25.200 --> 04:26.800
IT'S SHIVAH.

04:26.833 --> 04:28.833
IS IT SHIVAH
EVEN IF SHE'S CATHOLIC?

04:28.867 --> 04:31.500
WELL, SHIVAH'S WHAT
I KNOW HOW TO DO, SO...

04:31.533 --> 04:32.567
YEAH, IT'S SHIVAH.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.500
AND IF WE'RE SITTING SHIVAH
FOR DENNY,

04:34.533 --> 04:35.600
THEN WE SHOULD ORDER IN

04:35.633 --> 04:38.267
BECAUSE MAKING SANDWICHES
IS NOT THE SAME AS COOKING.

04:38.300 --> 04:40.400
SANDWICHES ARE COMFORT FOOD.

04:40.433 --> 04:42.300
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

04:42.333 --> 04:43.500
EVERYTHING WITH ME IS FINE.

04:43.533 --> 04:46.167
IT'S IZZIE
THAT WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT.

04:46.200 --> 04:47.467
OH, WHAT DID YOU DO?

04:48.800 --> 04:51.100
DENNY DIED.
BURKE GOT SHOT.

04:51.133 --> 04:52.600
LET'S JUST
HAVE SOME PERSPECTIVE

04:52.633 --> 04:56.567
AND REMEMBER WHAT I DID
IS A TINY, SLIGHTLY SMALL--

04:56.600 --> 04:58.500
WHATEVER. SPIT IT OUT.

05:00.667 --> 05:03.633
I LOST MY PANTIES LAST NIGHT.

05:07.267 --> 05:08.800
(buzzer sounds)

05:22.433 --> 05:24.433
(Richard) YOU BACK ALREADY?

05:24.467 --> 05:26.367
OH, I NEVER LEFT.
I DID A CRANIOTOMY

05:26.400 --> 05:28.067
ON A, UH, RUPTURED
SACCULAR ANEURYSM.

05:28.067 --> 05:30.233
I'VE BEEN HERE
ALL NIGHT, TOO.

05:30.267 --> 05:32.167
I WANTED TO SEE
THE AUTOPSY ON DUQUETTE.

05:32.200 --> 05:33.767
YEAH.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.133
HAVE YOU SEEN MEREDITH?

05:35.167 --> 05:36.700
UH, DR. GREY--

05:36.733 --> 05:39.200
HAVE YOU SEEN, UH,
HAVE YOU SEEN DR. GREY?

05:39.233 --> 05:40.833
WHY? WHAT'S GOIN' ON
WITH YOU?

05:40.867 --> 05:42.400
NO, COULD YOU JUST--

05:42.433 --> 05:43.733
CAN YOU GET SOMEBODY
TO COVER MY ROUNDS FOR ME

05:43.767 --> 05:46.233
SO I CAN TAKE CARE
OF SOME STUFF?
ARE YOU FREE, DR. SHEPHERD?

05:46.267 --> 05:48.267
THERE'S AN INCOMING
HEAD TRAUMA,

05:48.300 --> 05:51.500
AND THE PIT'S OVERCROWDED
WITH EARLY FLU SEASON.

05:51.533 --> 05:54.133
(man) GISELLE TOUSSAINT,
42-YEAR-OLD WOMAN,

05:54.167 --> 05:56.400
UNRESTRAINED DRIVER OF A CAR
THAT HIT A RAILING.

05:56.433 --> 05:58.700
EJECTED FROM THE CAR.

05:58.733 --> 06:01.800
SHE WAS--WE WERE COMING TO
THE E.R. WE WERE BOTH SICK.

06:01.833 --> 06:03.833
WE COULDN'T SHAKE
THIS FLU THING.

06:03.867 --> 06:05.633
SO SHE WAS BETTER,
SO I LET HER DRIVE.

06:05.667 --> 06:08.267
(George) SIR?
OMAR?

06:08.300 --> 06:09.367
GISELLE, HONEY.

06:09.400 --> 06:12.200
WHERE ARE WE? OH, YEAH.

06:12.233 --> 06:14.233
ARE WE...
ARE WE DANCING?

06:14.267 --> 06:16.233
WE HAD AN ACCIDENT.
WE HAVE A DURAL LACERATION.

06:16.267 --> 06:18.700
SHE'S LEAKING SPINAL FLUID.
LET'S GET AN O.R. READY, OKAY?

06:18.733 --> 06:21.167
THE DANCING'S SO BEAUTIFUL.
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.700
(coughing)

06:23.733 --> 06:26.567
HE'S BURNING UP.
ALL RIGHT,
SOMEBODY GET HIM A BED.

06:26.600 --> 06:29.467
LET'S GET HER
UP TO THE O.R. RIGHT AWAY.

06:29.500 --> 06:31.433
(baby cries)

06:31.467 --> 06:34.200
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?
PREMATURE NEWBORN
FOUND IN A TRASH CAN

06:34.233 --> 06:36.267
AT TURNER PREP SCHOOL.

06:36.300 --> 06:38.333
THE UMBILICAL CORD'S
STILL ATTACHED.
YOU DIDN'T START AN I.V.?
HE'S DEHYDRATED.

06:38.367 --> 06:41.600
WE COULDN'T FIND A VEIN.
I NEED TO GET
AN I.V. ACCESS.

06:41.633 --> 06:43.333
GET ME AN I.O. NEEDLE,

06:43.367 --> 06:45.733
AND I NEED
A NEONATAL INTUBATION KIT.

06:45.767 --> 06:48.467
OLIVIA, GO! MOVE. NOW.
THEY PULLED ME
FROM THE FLOOR.

06:48.500 --> 06:51.600
I'M JUST DOWN HERE HELPING
WITH THE FLU OVERFLOW.

06:51.633 --> 06:54.333
(people coughing)

06:54.367 --> 06:56.400
ALEX, HOW OLD'S THAT BABY?

06:56.433 --> 06:58.533
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
IF YOU THINK
I'M GOING TO LEAVE

06:58.567 --> 07:01.200
THIS SICK, PREMATURE INFANT
IN THE E.R.--

07:01.233 --> 07:04.100
HE HAS TO BE ADMITTED.
YOU CAN'T JUST TAKE HIM.
JUST PAGE ADDISON SHEPHERD!

07:04.133 --> 07:09.600
PAGE ADDISON SHEPHERD.
TELL HER TO MEET ME IN THE NICU.

07:13.267 --> 07:14.633
KAREV.

07:14.667 --> 07:16.567
PREMATURE NEWBORN MALE
WITH PETECHIAE.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.400
WHAT'S HIS PLATELET COUNT?
17,000.

07:18.433 --> 07:20.333
17,000?
DID YOU TRANSFUSE PLATELETS?

07:20.367 --> 07:21.533
YES, BUT IT DIDN'T HELP.

07:21.567 --> 07:23.700
WHERE'S THE MOTHER?
I DON'T KNOW.

07:23.733 --> 07:25.400
DR. KAREV...

07:25.433 --> 07:28.167
I'M NOT ASKING YOU WHERE
THE MOTHER IS FOR MY HEALTH.

07:28.200 --> 07:30.233
I EXPECT YOU TO USE YOUR BRAIN.
WHERE IS THE MOTHER?

07:30.267 --> 07:31.700
I DON'T KNOW!

07:31.733 --> 07:34.767
THE BABY WAS FOUND IN
A TRASH CAN AT A HIGH SCHOOL.

07:34.800 --> 07:36.533
THEY LEFT HIM
IN A TRASH CAN.

07:36.567 --> 07:38.700
HE'S GOT SOME INNER
ABDOMINAL BLEEDING ON C.T.

07:38.733 --> 07:42.367
YOU WANT TO RUN
SOME MORE TESTS?

07:42.400 --> 07:43.500
DR. SHEPHERD?

07:43.533 --> 07:45.200
I NEED A STAT ULTRASOUND

07:45.233 --> 07:47.433
AND FOR YOU TO INFUSE
2 GRAMS OF I.V.I.G.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.367
IF THERE IS
NO CRANIAL BLEEDING.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.067
AND THEN FIND OUT
WHERE THE MOTHER IS.

07:51.100 --> 07:52.467
I NEED TO TEST FOR
MATERNAL PLATELET ANTIBODIES.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.700
CAN'T YOU JUST DO SURGERY
TO FIX THE ABDOMINAL BLEEDING?

07:54.733 --> 07:57.767
IF I WANTED TO KILL HIM,
I COULD DO THAT. DAMN IT.

07:57.800 --> 07:59.700
WHO DOES THIS?

07:59.733 --> 08:01.633
DR. MONTGOMERY-SHEPHERD,

08:01.667 --> 08:03.600
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE HERE
ABOUT THE BABY.

08:03.633 --> 08:04.800
(George)
THE CLOT'S BEEN EVACUATED.

08:04.833 --> 08:06.500
ARE WE READY TO CLOSE?

08:06.533 --> 08:07.700
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

08:07.733 --> 08:09.533
THERE ARE
NO REMAINING BONE FRAGMENTS.

08:09.567 --> 08:12.067
HOW'S IZZIE?

08:12.100 --> 08:14.367
AS WELL
AS CAN BE EXPECTED.

08:14.400 --> 08:17.667
IT'S NEVER GETS EASIER,
YOU KNOW? LOSING A PATIENT.

08:17.700 --> 08:21.067
IT GETS A LITTLE LESS...
SHOCKING, I GUESS, BUT...

08:21.100 --> 08:23.800
IT NEVER GETS ANY EASIER.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.500
IZZIE WAS IN LOVE WITH HIM.

08:27.533 --> 08:31.333
DENNY WASN'T JUST A PATIENT.
THEY WERE IN LOVE.

08:35.433 --> 08:37.333
(Cristina)
YOU HAD SEX WITH DEREK

08:37.367 --> 08:39.367
IN AN EXAM ROOM
AT THE PROM?
YES.

08:39.400 --> 08:41.433
LAST NIGHT,
YOU AND SHEPHERD DID IT?

08:41.467 --> 08:42.233
YES.

08:42.267 --> 08:45.800
YOU AND McDREAMY
DID THE NASTY-NASTY?

08:45.833 --> 08:47.167
CRISTINA!
I'M NOT JUDGING.

08:47.200 --> 08:49.100
I'M JUST TRYING
TO WRAP MY MIND AROUND IT.

08:49.133 --> 08:52.533
I MEAN, YOU'RE WITH FINN,
AND HE'S WITH ADDISON.
HE'S MARRIED TO ADDISON.

08:52.567 --> 08:54.300
YEAH.

08:54.333 --> 08:56.367
WELL, WHAT DID DEREK SAY?

08:56.400 --> 08:58.333
HE SAID, "MEREDITH,
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?"

08:58.367 --> 09:00.833
(scoffs) OKAY...
HE HAS SEX WITH YOU

09:00.867 --> 09:02.767
AND HE'S STANDING THERE
ALL McGUILTY,

09:02.800 --> 09:04.700
AND ALL HE HAS TO SAY
FOR HIMSELF IS,

09:04.733 --> 09:06.333
"OH, WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?"

09:06.367 --> 09:08.133
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

09:08.167 --> 09:09.633
I DON'T KNOW.

09:09.667 --> 09:11.533
WELL, ARE YOU GONNA
GO BACK TO FINN?

09:11.567 --> 09:13.600
UH, I-IS SHEPHERD
LEAVING HIS WIFE?

09:13.633 --> 09:15.267
(clock ticking)

09:15.300 --> 09:16.467
I JUST--

09:16.500 --> 09:18.633
(Ellis) MEREDITH,
HOLD ON WITH BOTH HANDS.

09:18.667 --> 09:21.300
MEREDITH!

09:21.333 --> 09:23.067
MOMMY!

09:23.100 --> 09:24.567
RICHARD,
YOU WERE TO TELL ADELE.
LOOK, I-I CAN'T.

09:24.600 --> 09:28.133
I WAS TO TELL THATCHER.
THAT IS WHAT WE SAID.
I CAN'T DO IT.

09:28.167 --> 09:30.067
THAT IS WHAT WE AGREED.

09:30.100 --> 09:34.533
PLEASE, RICHARD, PLEASE.
YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME.
ELLIS, NO.

09:34.567 --> 09:36.600
RICHARD, YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME!

09:36.633 --> 09:38.667
(cries)

09:38.700 --> 09:41.400
RICHARD!

09:41.433 --> 09:43.433
RICHARD!

09:43.467 --> 09:45.233
RICHARD!
(clock ticks)

09:45.267 --> 09:47.167
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO MAKE
AN APPOINTMENT TO SEE ME.

09:47.200 --> 09:49.100
I'M YOUR HUSBAND.

09:49.133 --> 09:51.067
AN APPOINTMENT SEEMED TO BE
THE BEST WAY TO GET

09:51.067 --> 09:53.067
YOUR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION,
BECAUSE HERE YOU ARE.
ADELE, LISTEN--

09:53.067 --> 09:54.300
SIT DOWN.
ADELE--

09:54.333 --> 09:56.233
SIT DOWN!
WE HAVE AN APPOINTMENT.

09:56.267 --> 09:57.600
UH, CHIEF, EX--

09:57.633 --> 10:00.600
UM, THE I.D.C. IS HERE.

10:00.633 --> 10:02.500
WE HAD A COUPLE
COME IN THIS MORNING--

10:02.533 --> 10:04.500
DEREK JUST FINISHED
A CRANIOTOMY ON THE WIFE--

10:04.533 --> 10:06.267
BUT THE HUSBAND,

10:06.300 --> 10:08.200
HE'S GOT SEVERE FLU SYMPTOMS--
SWOLLEN LYMPH NODS, BUBOES.

10:08.233 --> 10:11.067
TURNS OUT THEY CAME
IN CONTACT WITH THE PLAGUE.
THE PLAGUE?

10:11.100 --> 10:13.133
LOOK, I'M SORRY, ADELE.

10:13.167 --> 10:15.800
I-I NEED TO DEAL WITH THIS.

10:15.833 --> 10:17.733
(woman) SHANNON IS
A STRAIGHT-A STUDENT.

10:17.767 --> 10:19.667
(man) SO WHAT, MY DAUGHTER
GETS A B IN MATH,

10:19.700 --> 10:22.533
AND SUDDENLY SHE'S BIRTHING
BABIES IN TOILET STALLS?

10:22.567 --> 10:24.233
I'M DR. MONTGOMERY-SHEPHERD.
I'M TREATING THE NEWBORN.

10:24.267 --> 10:26.467
HE HAS
AN EMERGENT BLOOD CONDITION.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.367
I NEED TO KNOW WHOSE BABY IT IS
I'M DEALING WITH.

10:28.400 --> 10:30.300
(woman) YEAH, WE'D ALL
LIKE TO KNOW THAT.

10:30.333 --> 10:32.767
SARA... TALK.

10:32.800 --> 10:35.667
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT ANY BABY, MOM.
NONE OF US DO.

10:35.700 --> 10:37.400
WELL, ONE OF YOU
MUST KNOW SOMETHING,

10:37.433 --> 10:39.733
OTHERWISE YOU AND YOUR PARENTS
WOULDN'T BE HERE.

10:39.767 --> 10:41.667
OUR GIRLS--THE PRINCIPAL
SAID THAT THEY WERE

10:41.700 --> 10:43.667
THE LAST PEOPLE IN THE BATHROOM
BEFORE THAT BABY WAS FOUND.

10:43.700 --> 10:45.567
SO WE JUST THOUGHT,
BEFORE THE POLICE SHOW UP...

10:45.600 --> 10:47.400
ONE OF YOU KNOWS,
AND YOU BETTER CONFESS.

10:47.433 --> 10:49.333
I DON'T WANT MY LISA
MESSED UP IN THIS.

10:49.367 --> 10:51.300
(woman) LOOK, THE POLICE
WILL BE HERE SOON.

10:51.333 --> 10:53.300
CAN'T YOU JUST DO
SOME SORT OF D.N.A. TEST

10:53.333 --> 10:55.233
SO THAT THE REST OF US
CAN GET OUT OF HERE?

10:55.267 --> 10:57.467
D.N.A. RESULTS TAKE DAYS,
AND FRANKLY, I'M NOT CONCERNED

10:57.500 --> 10:59.400
WITH GETTING THE REST OF YOU
"OUT OF HERE."

10:59.433 --> 11:01.333
IF THIS BABY ISN'T TREATED,
HE'S GOING TO DIE.

11:01.367 --> 11:04.267
NOW I CAN DO VAGINAL EXAMS
ON EACH OF THE GIRLS--

11:04.300 --> 11:06.833
MY DAUGHTER IS 14 YEARS OLD.
SHE'S NOT SEXUALLY ACTIVE.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.767
AND I WON'T HAVE YOU
VIOLATING HER BODY.

11:08.800 --> 11:11.300
YOU WON'T HAVE IT
'CAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S YOUR KID.

11:11.333 --> 11:12.733
I TELL YOU WHAT,
YOU HAVE MY CONSENT

11:12.767 --> 11:14.667
TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO PROVE MY LISA'S INNOCENT.

11:14.700 --> 11:17.167
YOU ARE A SICK BASTARD,
YOU KNOW THAT?

11:17.200 --> 11:19.400
A CHILD'S LIFE
IS IN JEOPARDY HERE.

11:19.433 --> 11:22.200
AND IT'S NOT YOUR CONSENT
THAT I NEED.

11:25.867 --> 11:27.600
WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

11:27.633 --> 11:30.533
JUST BECAUSE WE WERE IN THERE
DOESN'T MEAN IT'S OUR BABY.

11:30.567 --> 11:32.700
DO WE LOOK LIKE THE KIND
OF GIRLS WHO GET PREGNANT

11:32.733 --> 11:35.467
AND THROW THEIR KIDS
INTO THE TRASH?

11:37.267 --> 11:39.233
(Derek) NICE WORK TODAY,
O'MALLEY.

11:39.267 --> 11:41.400
HEY, DID MEREDITH
GO HOME WITH IZZIE?

11:41.433 --> 11:44.300
YEAH, CRISTINA, TOO.
I'M HEADED THERE NOW.
YEAH, ME, TOO.

11:44.333 --> 11:46.233
OH, GREAT.
IT'S JUST THAT, UM...

11:46.267 --> 11:48.633
I DON'T KNOW IF IZZIE'S
UP FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.567
WELL, I'M GONNA
GO SEE MEREDITH.

11:50.600 --> 11:51.767
OH.
OKAY.

11:51.800 --> 11:53.567
DR. SHEPHERD?
YES.

11:53.600 --> 11:55.267
DR. O'MALLEY?
YEAH.

11:55.300 --> 11:57.200
I'M WITH THE I.D.C.
IS ANYONE ELSE IN THIS ROOM?
NO.

11:57.233 --> 11:58.667
YOU PERFORMED THE SURGERY
ON MRS. TOUSSAINT?

11:58.700 --> 12:01.267
YES.
SHE AND HER HUSBAND WERE
IN CLOSE CONTACT

12:01.300 --> 12:03.067
WITH A VICTIM OF THE PLAGUE.
SHE MAY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED.

12:03.100 --> 12:04.167
WHICH MEANS
WE MAY HAVE BEEN.
YEAH.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.100
I GOTTA GO.
I CAN'T DO THIS.

12:06.133 --> 12:07.833
WE'RE WAITING ON THE DIAGNOSIS
ON MRS. TOUSSAINT.

12:07.867 --> 12:09.767
THIS ROOM WILL BE SEALED OFF
UNTIL WE KNOW THE THREAT

12:09.800 --> 12:11.733
HAS BEEN CONTAINED,
AND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY SAFE.

12:11.767 --> 12:13.067
YOU'RE NOT SAYING--
YOU CANNOT LEAVE.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.667
YOU TWO ARE QUARANTINED.

12:18.833 --> 12:20.200
THEY WORK FAST.

12:20.233 --> 12:22.133
ANYONE WHO WAS IN CONTACT
WITH THE TOUSSAINTS

12:22.167 --> 12:23.367
IS IN QUARANTINE.

12:23.400 --> 12:24.567
SHEPHERD AND O'MALLEY
ARE NOT HAPPY.

12:24.600 --> 12:26.100
BUT EVERYTHING'S
UNDER CONTROL

12:26.133 --> 12:28.067
IF YOU NEED TO GET BACK
TO YOUR WIFE.

12:28.067 --> 12:29.800
OH, NO, NO. I SHOULD
CHECK IN WITH THE I.D.C. REP.

12:29.833 --> 12:31.733
YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO STAY
ON TOP OF MY HOSPITAL.

12:31.767 --> 12:33.267
KEEP ME POSTED.

12:33.300 --> 12:34.633
(pager beeps)

12:34.667 --> 12:36.167
(Omar) HELLO! HELLO!

12:36.200 --> 12:39.667
I NEED HELP.
SOMEBODY, PLEASE.

12:39.700 --> 12:41.600
I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR ME.

12:41.633 --> 12:43.533
I SEE YOU
STANDING OUT THERE

12:43.567 --> 12:46.067
IN YOUR GIANT
WHITE SPACE SUIT.
SIR?

12:46.067 --> 12:48.767
YES!
NO UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL
BEYOND THIS POINT, MA'AM.

12:48.800 --> 12:50.300
I.D.C. REGULATIONS.

12:50.333 --> 12:52.233
LOOK, I KNOW
HE'S UNDER QUARANTINE,

12:52.267 --> 12:54.133
BUT HE IS ALSO A PATIENT.

12:54.167 --> 12:56.067
AND I WILL NOT IGNORE
A PATIENT.

12:56.100 --> 12:58.133
AH. HELLO OUT THERE.

12:58.167 --> 12:59.833
THANK GOD.
THANK GOD YOU CAN HEAR ME.

12:59.867 --> 13:01.500
HOW IS MY WIFE?

13:01.533 --> 13:03.433
MY NAME IS DR. BAILEY--
MIRANDA BAILEY.

13:03.467 --> 13:06.533
YOUR WIFE IS OUT OF SURGERY.
SHE'S QUARANTINED IN RECOVERY,

13:06.567 --> 13:09.100
BUT SHE'S DOING FINE.
NOW YOU WERE ASKING FOR HELP?

13:09.133 --> 13:12.300
YOU KNOW HOW MANY DAYS
I BEEN IN HERE?
IT'S ONLY BEEN A FEW HOURS.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.133
REALLY?

13:14.167 --> 13:15.367
I'M LOSING IT.

13:15.400 --> 13:17.333
I'M LOSING TRACK
OF TIME.

13:17.367 --> 13:18.700
OKAY, SIR, YOU'RE SWEATING.

13:18.733 --> 13:22.367
I NEED YOU TO SIT DOWN.
GET BACK IN THE BED.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.633
WH-WHAT ABOUT
MY WIFE GISELLE?

13:24.667 --> 13:26.767
CAN YOU FIND OUT
ABOUT GISELLE?

13:26.800 --> 13:30.133
LIKE I SAID, SIR, SHE CAME
OUT OF SURGERY JUST FINE,

13:30.167 --> 13:32.300
BUT I CAN CHECK
ON HER STATUS AGAIN.

13:32.333 --> 13:34.233
YOU JUST STAY CALM
UNTIL I GET BACK.

13:34.267 --> 13:36.200
NO! NO, WAIT, WAIT.
DON'T GO. PLEASE.

13:36.233 --> 13:37.433
JUST...

13:37.467 --> 13:38.800
JUST STAY A MINUTE.

13:38.833 --> 13:40.333
PLEASE.

13:40.367 --> 13:43.467
OKAY. UM... I'M STAYING.

13:43.500 --> 13:45.767
OMAR.

13:45.800 --> 13:47.067
CALL ME OMAR.

13:47.067 --> 13:49.633
OKAY, OMAR. I'M...

13:49.667 --> 13:50.733
(sighs)

13:50.767 --> 13:53.400
I'M RIGHT HERE.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.667
(doorbell rings)

13:57.467 --> 13:59.067
I BROUGHT FOOD.

13:59.067 --> 14:00.767
UH, GEORGE ISN'T HERE.

14:00.800 --> 14:02.300
NO, I-I KNOW.

14:02.333 --> 14:04.533
UH, HE'S IN A QUARANTINE
'CAUSE OF A-A THING.

14:04.567 --> 14:06.600
AND I WAS OFF DUTY
AND I WAS WORRIED ABOUT HIM

14:06.633 --> 14:08.633
AND GOING CRAZY,
AND I THOUGHT ABOUT IZZIE,

14:08.667 --> 14:11.267
AND SO I BROUGHT FOOD.
FOR THE SHIVAH.

14:11.300 --> 14:13.333
ARE--ARE YOU GONNA
LET ME IN?

14:13.367 --> 14:14.567
YEAH.

14:16.567 --> 14:18.067
(clears throat)

14:19.867 --> 14:22.400
RELAX, I'M NOT
GONNA BRING IT UP--

14:22.433 --> 14:24.133
YOU AND McDREAMY
AND THE SEX.

14:24.167 --> 14:26.200
I'M NOT THAT PERSON.
GOOD.

14:26.233 --> 14:28.800
OKAY.
GOOD.

14:28.833 --> 14:30.767
SHIVAH? IS IT SHIVAH
IF IZZIE'S CATHOLIC?

14:30.800 --> 14:33.067
THIS THING
THAT YOU'RE DOING, IZZIE,

14:33.067 --> 14:34.400
IT'S NOT HEALTHY.

14:34.433 --> 14:36.367
I MEAN, YOU GOTTA
TAKE OFF THAT DRESS.

14:37.800 --> 14:40.067
TELL ME ABOUT SHIVAH.

14:41.633 --> 14:43.533
WELL, IT'S SOMETHING YOU DO
WHEN SOMEONE DIES.

14:43.567 --> 14:45.433
YOU KNOW, WE DID IT
FOR MY GRANDMOTHER.

14:45.467 --> 14:47.600
HOW DOES IT WORK?

14:47.633 --> 14:49.533
PEOPLE BRING OVER FOOD,

14:49.567 --> 14:51.067
FAMILY COMES OVER.

14:51.100 --> 14:53.400
IT'S SUPPOSED TO HELP
WITH THE GRIEVING, YOU KNOW?

14:53.433 --> 14:56.267
IT HONORS THE DEAD.

14:56.300 --> 14:57.500
SOUNDS NICE.

14:57.533 --> 14:59.400
(scoffs) YEAH.

14:59.433 --> 15:01.333
SEVEN DAYS
OF NO LEATHER SHOES,

15:01.367 --> 15:03.067
NO--NO WORK, NO SEX,

15:03.067 --> 15:04.800
NO SITTING ON THINGS
HIGHER THAN A FOOT,

15:04.833 --> 15:07.200
NO--NO SHAVING, NO...

15:08.400 --> 15:10.100
WHAT?

15:13.767 --> 15:15.267
NO CLEAN CLOTHES.

15:18.733 --> 15:21.600
IZZIE... THIS DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE SHIVAH.

15:21.633 --> 15:24.367
YOU KNOW THEY TOOK
HIS BODY AWAY.

15:26.067 --> 15:28.800
I WILL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN.

15:30.467 --> 15:33.367
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL
IF YOU NEVER SAW BURKE AGAIN?

15:38.567 --> 15:41.433
SO WE'RE SITTING SHIVAH
FOR DENNY.

15:52.067 --> 15:53.300
YOU WANT TO SEE HIM?

15:53.333 --> 15:54.767
SEE WHO?

15:54.800 --> 15:56.567
THE BABY. YOUR BABY.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.267
IT'S NOT OUR BABY.

15:58.300 --> 16:00.600
(man) I'M GIVING YOU PERMISSION
TO DO THIS THING.

16:00.633 --> 16:02.367
NOW WHAT'S THE HANG-UP?

16:02.400 --> 16:03.567
THE "HANG-UP," SIR,

16:03.600 --> 16:05.500
IS THAT IF YOUR DAUGHTER
DOESN'T WANT TO DO IT,

16:05.533 --> 16:06.700
I CAN'T FORCE HER.

16:06.733 --> 16:09.233
THEY'RE 14. THEY'RE MINORS.
WE STILL HAVE A SAY.

16:09.267 --> 16:10.367
(Richard) NO, YOU DON'T.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.433
IF SOMEONE DOESN'T WANT TO
SUBMIT TO A VAGINAL EXAM,

16:12.467 --> 16:15.167
THEY DON'T HAVE TO.
IT'S THE LAW.

16:15.200 --> 16:17.767
ALL RIGHT. THAT'S IT.
I'M TAKING LISA HOME.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.767
YOU DO THAT, SIR,
AND I WILL HAVE YOU ARRESTED

16:19.800 --> 16:21.700
BEFORE YOU HIT
THE PARKING LOT.

16:21.733 --> 16:23.633
THE LAW ISN'T THE ONLY THING
IN PLAY HERE.

16:23.667 --> 16:25.700
IF I DO A VAGINAL EXAM
AND THE GIRL IS A VIRGIN,

16:25.733 --> 16:27.600
THERE COULD BE BLEEDING,
UNDUE TRAUMA,

16:27.633 --> 16:29.533
NOT TO MENTION
EMOTIONAL STRESS.

16:29.567 --> 16:31.600
WELL, IF I HAD
TO TAKE A GUESS

16:31.633 --> 16:34.600
AS TO WHOSE KID WON'T
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT--
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

16:34.633 --> 16:37.067
IT'D JUST BE NICE
IF KAREN HAD A CURFEW.

16:37.067 --> 16:38.800
WELL, AT LEAST
SHE'S NOT A SHOPLIFTER.

16:38.833 --> 16:41.700
OH, SHANNON STOLE ONE LIPSTICK
WHEN SHE WAS 9. GET OVER IT.

16:41.733 --> 16:44.100
(man) I KNOW FOR A FACT
THAT MY LISA IS A VIRGIN.
REALLY? AND HOW
DO YOU KNOW THAT?

16:44.133 --> 16:45.467
BECAUSE SHE'S ONLY
14 YEARS OLD!

16:45.500 --> 16:46.833
(clock ticking)
THEY'RE ALL 14.

16:46.867 --> 16:48.767
(Addison) DEREK.
DEREK LISTEN TO ME.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.700
DEREK, YOU CAN'T DO THIS.
DEREK, WE HAVE TO--

16:50.733 --> 16:52.633
WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

16:52.667 --> 16:54.567
NO, WE DON'T.
YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME
A CHANCE TO EXPLAIN.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.600
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT ARE YOU
DOING WITH MY CLOTHES, DEREK?!

16:56.633 --> 16:58.267
IT WAS ONE TIME! I KNOW
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE SAY.

16:58.300 --> 17:00.200
I KNOW THAT'S WHAT ALWAYS
GETS SAID, BUT IT'S--

17:00.233 --> 17:01.400
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW IT HAPPENED.

17:01.433 --> 17:03.100
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

17:03.133 --> 17:05.067
HE WAS JUST--HE WAS JUST HERE.
HE WAS JUST HERE.

17:05.067 --> 17:06.833
YOU SCREW MY BEST FRIEND,
AND ALL YOU CAN SAY--

17:06.867 --> 17:09.067
"HE WAS JUST HERE"?
GET OUT.
NO.

17:09.067 --> 17:10.533
GET OUT.
NO.

17:10.567 --> 17:12.467
NO, I'M NOT GOING. WE'RE GONNA
JUST TALK ABOUT THIS.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.300
WE'RE GONNA DISCUSS THIS.
GET OUT OF MY HOUSE NOW!

17:14.333 --> 17:16.433
NO. NO.
I'M HOLDING MY GROUND.

17:16.467 --> 17:19.167
LET'S GO!
I AM HOLDING MY GROUND.
WE DON'T QUIT!

17:19.200 --> 17:21.133
WE HAVE TO WORK--
GET OUT.

17:21.167 --> 17:22.433
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
DEREK! NO!

17:22.467 --> 17:26.167
(crying) PLEASE.

17:26.200 --> 17:28.567
PLEASE.

17:28.600 --> 17:29.733
DEREK.

17:29.767 --> 17:31.267
(bangs on door)

17:31.300 --> 17:33.100
PLEASE.

17:33.133 --> 17:35.100
PLEASE.

17:35.133 --> 17:37.067
***

17:37.067 --> 17:39.200
(Addison crying) PLEASE.

17:39.233 --> 17:42.167
PLEASE.

17:42.200 --> 17:43.567
I'M SORRY.

17:43.600 --> 17:46.067
I'M SORRY.

17:46.067 --> 17:48.433
YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME
A CHANCE.

17:48.467 --> 17:51.300
YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME A CHANCE
TO SHOW YOU HOW SORRY I AM.

17:51.333 --> 17:53.533
(crying)
I'M SORRY, OKAY?

17:53.567 --> 17:54.500
OKAY.

17:54.533 --> 17:57.433
OKAY?

17:57.467 --> 18:01.200
(breathes heavily)

18:01.233 --> 18:04.233
***

18:04.267 --> 18:05.667
I'M GONNA GO. YOU STAY.

18:05.700 --> 18:07.467
I'LL GET MY CLOTHES
IN THE MORNING.

18:07.500 --> 18:09.800
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
WE CAN SURVIVE THIS.

18:09.833 --> 18:11.733
DEREK...
WE CAN SURVIVE THIS.

18:11.767 --> 18:13.233
WE'RE...

18:13.267 --> 18:15.533
WE'RE ADDISON AND DEREK.

18:15.567 --> 18:17.067
I CAN'T LOOK AT YOU.

18:17.100 --> 18:19.167
I LOOK AT YOU,
AND I FEEL NAUSEOUS.

18:19.200 --> 18:20.433
I JUST...

18:20.467 --> 18:26.267
***

18:26.300 --> 18:28.367
WE'RE NOT
DEREK AND ADDISON ANYMORE.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.200
IF YOU GO NOW...

18:30.233 --> 18:32.733
IF YOU GO NOW...

18:32.767 --> 18:34.800
WE ARE NOT
GONNA GET THROUGH THIS.

18:34.833 --> 18:37.667
IF YOU GO NOW...
WE DON'T HAVE A CHANCE.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.700
WE DON'T HAVE A CHANCE...

18:39.733 --> 18:41.233
IF YOU GO NOW.

18:41.267 --> 18:43.800
IF YOU GO...

18:43.833 --> 18:50.067
(door slams)

18:50.067 --> 18:52.267
(clock ticks)

18:52.833 --> 18:56.800
(woman laughing)

18:56.833 --> 18:58.500
HI. UH, YOU'RE--

18:58.533 --> 19:00.433
ARE YOU PRESTON BURKE?

19:00.467 --> 19:00.900
UH, YES.

19:00.933 --> 19:02.667
THE PRESTON BURKE.

19:02.700 --> 19:05.433
DR. BURKE, I AM
SUCH A HUGE FAN.

19:05.467 --> 19:06.633
THAT STENTLESS
VALVE REPLACEMENT

19:06.667 --> 19:09.133
FOR INFECTIOUS ENDOCARDITIS
THAT YOU PERFORMED?

19:09.167 --> 19:12.233
AND YOUR USE OF TRANSMYOCARDIAL
REVASCULARIZATION?

19:12.267 --> 19:13.500
I-I'M CRISTINA YANG.

19:13.533 --> 19:15.467
IF--IF I COULD JUST
GET THE CHANCE

19:15.500 --> 19:17.400
TO STUDY UNDER YOU,
I WOULD BE...

19:17.433 --> 19:19.100
YOU ARE SO AMAZING!

19:19.133 --> 19:20.767
YES, WELL...

19:20.800 --> 19:22.667
THANK YOU.

19:22.700 --> 19:26.467
***

19:26.500 --> 19:29.367
I MEAN, ONE OF MY CHOICES
WAS, UH, SAN DIEGO.

19:29.400 --> 19:32.200
I COULDA GONE
TO SAN DIEGO.

19:32.233 --> 19:34.133
YOU KNOW, SEATTLE'S HOME,
SO...

19:34.167 --> 19:36.833
SO YOU'RE NEW TO SEATTLE.

19:36.867 --> 19:38.533
OH, NO. I-I, UM,
I KIND OF LIVE HERE.

19:38.567 --> 19:41.333
MY MOTHER LIVED HERE--
LIVES HERE--

19:41.367 --> 19:43.067
AND I LIVE IN HER HOUSE.

19:43.100 --> 19:45.633
WOW, THAT'S GREAT
'CAUSE HOUSING IS A NIGHTMARE.

19:45.667 --> 19:49.133
I'M LIVING WITH MY,
UH, PARENTS AT HOME,

19:49.167 --> 19:50.667
WHICH, UH, WELL, SUCKS.

19:50.700 --> 19:52.400
OH, IT'S NICE MEETING YOU.

19:52.433 --> 19:54.467
(clock ticks)

19:55.467 --> 19:57.367
WE'VE BEEN EXPOSED
TO THE PLAGUE.

19:57.400 --> 19:59.300
THEY DON'T KNOW
IT'S THE PLAGUE.

19:59.333 --> 20:01.233
SO THE MEN IN, UH,
WHITE SUITS,

20:01.267 --> 20:03.733
JUST, WHAT, MAKING
A FASHION STATEMENT?
NO, IT'S A PRECAUTION.

20:03.767 --> 20:06.333
WHEN THE BLOOD WORK COMES BACK,
WE'LL BE OUTTA HERE.

20:06.367 --> 20:08.267
WHAT IF THE RESULTS COME BACK

20:08.300 --> 20:10.200
AND SHE'S, UH,
SHE HAS THE PLAGUE?

20:10.233 --> 20:11.600
WELL,
THEN WE GET THE PLAGUE

20:11.633 --> 20:13.533
AND THEN WE DIE IN HERE
WITH THE CRAPPY BENCHES

20:13.567 --> 20:15.300
AND THE DIRTY SCRUBS

20:15.333 --> 20:17.500
AND THE LOCKERS
FULL OF OLD FOOD.

20:17.533 --> 20:19.200
THERE'S FOOD IN THE LOCKERS?

20:19.233 --> 20:21.233
DR. SHEPHERD,
THOSE ARE PEOPLE'S PERSON--

20:21.267 --> 20:23.767
THAT'S ALEX'S APPLE.

20:23.800 --> 20:25.367
THAT'S JUST RUDE.

20:25.400 --> 20:27.733
SAFE HAVEN LAWS--

20:27.767 --> 20:29.667
ALL THOSE GIRLS
WOULD'VE HAD TO DO

20:29.700 --> 20:31.567
IS DROP THAT BABY OFF
AT A FIRE STATION

20:31.600 --> 20:33.567
OR A HOSPITAL.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.300
NOW... IT'S A MESS.

20:35.333 --> 20:36.667
WHAT ARE OUR OPTIONS HERE?

20:36.700 --> 20:38.433
BLOOD TYPING.

20:38.467 --> 20:40.433
WE TAKE A SAMPLE
FROM EACH OF THE GIRLS.

20:40.467 --> 20:42.367
THE BABY'S BLOOD TYPE
IS DOUBLE-O.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.233
IF THE GIRLS ARE A OR B,

20:44.267 --> 20:46.167
IT MEANS THE BABY
IS NOT THEIRS.

20:46.200 --> 20:49.033
DO IT.

20:49.067 --> 20:51.767
(Richard sighs)

20:51.800 --> 20:56.133
(sighs) EVERYONE THINKS
I'LL KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO HER.

20:56.167 --> 20:58.200
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO HER.

20:58.233 --> 20:59.167
(sighs)

20:59.200 --> 21:00.767
DARK AND TWISTY MEREDITH.

21:00.800 --> 21:02.733
I'M NOT DARK AND TWISTY.

21:02.767 --> 21:04.667
AND IF I AM DARK AND TWISTY,

21:04.700 --> 21:07.567
IT'S BECAUSE I LIVE MY LIFE
UNDER A BANNER OF AVOIDANCE.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.633
I AVOID. I'M AN AVOIDER.

21:09.667 --> 21:12.333
(Finn) HELLO?

21:13.400 --> 21:14.333
HEY.

21:14.367 --> 21:15.633
HEY.

21:15.667 --> 21:17.800
SO CAN WE, UH--

21:17.833 --> 21:20.433
IZZIE.
I GOTTA GO CHECK ON IZZIE.

21:23.367 --> 21:25.267
(Callie)
DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY.

21:25.300 --> 21:27.067
IT'S THE DOCTOR THING.

21:27.100 --> 21:28.533
WHAT?

21:28.567 --> 21:31.067
FOUR YEARS OF HIGH SCHOOL,
FOUR YEARS OF COLLEGE,

21:31.067 --> 21:32.500
FOUR YEARS OF MED SCHOOL--

21:32.533 --> 21:34.433
BY THE TIME WE GRADUATE,
WE'RE IN OUR LATE 20s,

21:34.467 --> 21:38.067
AND WE'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING
EXCEPT GO TO SCHOOL

21:38.100 --> 21:39.267
AND THINK ABOUT SCIENCE.

21:39.300 --> 21:42.100
TIME STOPS.
WE'RE SOCIALLY RETARDED.

21:42.133 --> 21:43.733
I MEAN, LOOK AT ME.

21:43.767 --> 21:46.600
I'M IN LOVE WITH A GUY
WHO WON'T SAY HE LOVES ME BACK,

21:46.633 --> 21:48.533
AND HERE I AM
IN HIS KITCHEN COOKING,

21:48.567 --> 21:50.467
JUST HOPING HE COMES HOME
AND NOTICES ME.

21:50.500 --> 21:51.667
I'M A TOTAL FREAK.

21:51.700 --> 21:54.533
I'M THAT GIRL
IN THE BACK OF THE CLASS

21:54.567 --> 21:55.733
WHO EATS HER HAIR.

21:55.767 --> 21:57.533
MEREDITH... (sighs)

21:57.567 --> 22:00.200
SHE'S 17 YEARS OLD.
WE'RE ALL 17 YEARS OLD.

22:00.233 --> 22:02.267
THIS IS HIGH SCHOOL
WITH SCALPELS, FINN.

22:09.200 --> 22:11.667
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO YOU.

22:13.667 --> 22:15.433
WHEN DYLAN DIED...

22:15.467 --> 22:17.367
WHEN--WHEN THE BOMB
WENT OFF,

22:17.400 --> 22:20.400
DID YOU FEEL LIKE...

22:20.433 --> 22:22.333
WHAT?

22:22.367 --> 22:26.167
LIKE YOU WERE MOVING
IN SLOW MOTION.

22:26.200 --> 22:28.100
HE WAS THERE
AND THEN HE WASN'T,

22:28.133 --> 22:31.067
LIKE I BLINKED,
AND HE WAS GONE.

22:33.733 --> 22:37.200
I FEEL LIKE
I'M MOVING IN SLOW MOTION...

22:37.233 --> 22:39.133
LIKE I'M MOVING
IN SLOW MOTION

22:39.167 --> 22:41.433
AND EVERYTHING
AROUND ME IS...

22:41.467 --> 22:42.667
MOVING SO FAST.

22:42.700 --> 22:45.400
AND I JUST
WANT TO GO BACK...

22:45.433 --> 22:47.833
(sighs) TO WHEN THINGS
WERE NORMAL,

22:47.867 --> 22:50.733
WHEN I WASN'T "POOR IZZIE
LAYING ON THE BATHROOM FLOOR

22:50.767 --> 22:53.167
IN HER PROM DRESS
WITH HER..."

22:55.133 --> 22:57.133
"HER DEAD FIANCé."

22:58.867 --> 23:01.533
BUT I AM.

23:01.567 --> 23:03.433
SO I CAN'T.

23:03.467 --> 23:05.400
AND I'M...

23:05.433 --> 23:07.600
JUST STUCK.

23:07.633 --> 23:09.300
AND THERE'S
ALL THIS PRESSURE

23:09.333 --> 23:11.233
'CAUSE EVERYONE'S
HOVERING AROUND ME,

23:11.267 --> 23:13.167
WAITING FOR ME
TO DO SOMETHING

23:13.200 --> 23:15.067
OR SAY SOMETHING
OR FLIP OUT OR YELL

23:15.100 --> 23:16.300
OR CRY SOME MORE,

23:16.333 --> 23:18.233
AND I'M HAPPY
TO PLAY MY PART.

23:18.267 --> 23:20.133
I'M HAPPY TO SAY THE LINES
AND DO WHATEVER IT IS

23:20.167 --> 23:22.067
THAT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE DOING

23:22.100 --> 23:23.833
IF IT WILL MAKE EVERYONE
FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE.

23:23.867 --> 23:25.633
BUT I DON'T--

23:25.667 --> 23:27.567
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DO THIS.

23:27.600 --> 23:29.500
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BE
THIS PERSON.

23:29.533 --> 23:31.367
I DON'T...

23:31.400 --> 23:34.400
I DON'T KNOW
WHO THIS PERSON IS.

23:34.433 --> 23:36.400
IZZIE...

23:38.300 --> 23:41.800
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

23:41.833 --> 23:45.167
HOW DID WE END UP HERE?

23:45.200 --> 23:46.533
WHY AM I ALONE?

23:46.567 --> 23:49.300
WHERE IS DENNY?

23:53.400 --> 23:56.133
YOU'RE NOT ALONE, IZ.

23:59.400 --> 24:01.067
TRAIL MIX AND WARM SODA--

24:01.100 --> 24:02.767
WHO PUTS WARM SODA
IN THEIR LOCKER?

24:02.800 --> 24:04.300
AS USUAL,
CRISTINA'S TOO LAZY

24:04.333 --> 24:06.233
TO STOCK HER LOCKER
WITH FOOD.

24:06.267 --> 24:08.167
OH, NOW I HIT
THE MOTHER LODE.

24:08.200 --> 24:09.533
HERE, LOOK AT THIS.

24:09.567 --> 24:11.467
I GOT GRANOLA,
COOKIES, MUFFINS.

24:11.500 --> 24:13.633
WHO EATS THIS MUCH?
THAT'S IZZIE'S LOCKER.

24:13.667 --> 24:15.567
SHE ATE A LOT. SAID IT KEPT
HER ENERGY UP.

24:15.600 --> 24:17.333
EATS.
WHAT?

24:17.367 --> 24:20.433
EATS. YOU SAID, "ATE."
"EATS," PRESENT TENSE.

24:20.467 --> 24:23.100
SHE DIDN'T DIE.
FEELS A LITTLE
LIKE SHE DID.

24:23.133 --> 24:25.200
SHE'S NEVER
COMIN' BACK HERE.

24:25.233 --> 24:27.833
YOU KNOW...

24:27.867 --> 24:31.567
I DON'T THINK SHE'S EVER
GONNA BE THE SAME.

24:31.600 --> 24:34.067
YOU KNOW,
THERE ARE MOMENTS, O'MALLEY,

24:34.067 --> 24:35.800
WHERE ALL OF A SUDDEN,
IN A SPLIT SECOND,

YOUR LIFE CHANGES FOREVER.

24:38.233 --> 24:40.667

YOU'RE SOMEWHERE ELSE.

24:40.700 --> 24:41.633
GENTLEMEN.

24:47.167 --> 24:49.167
NO.

24:54.700 --> 24:56.533

24:56.567 --> 24:59.833
A SPLIT SECOND...

24:59.867 --> 25:02.400
(Joe) STRAIGHT TEQUILA.

25:02.433 --> 25:05.067
REALLY? YOU ARE GONNA
BE SORRY IN THE MORNING.

25:05.067 --> 25:07.733
I'M ALWAYS SORRY
IN THE MORNING.

25:07.767 --> 25:11.300
BUT TOMORROW I START
MY FIRST DAY OF WORK,

DOUBLE SCOTCH,
SINGLE MALT, PLEASE.

25:17.667 --> 25:19.767
ALL RIGHT.
(clears throat)

25:19.800 --> 25:22.667
SO... IS THIS
A GOOD PLACE TO HANG OUT?

25:22.700 --> 25:24.400
(clears throat)

25:24.433 --> 25:27.267
I WOULDN'T KNOW.
NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE.

25:27.300 --> 25:29.200
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HAVEN'T EITHER.

25:29.233 --> 25:30.167
FIRST TIME HERE.

25:30.200 --> 25:32.833
I'M NEW IN TOWN.
I'VE NEVER BEEN TO SEATTLE.

25:32.867 --> 25:34.833
BUT I GOT A JOB, SO...

25:34.867 --> 25:38.100
***

25:38.133 --> 25:40.733
AH, YOU'RE IGNORING ME.

25:40.767 --> 25:43.467
I'M TRYING TO.
YOU SHOULDN'T IGNORE ME.

25:43.500 --> 25:44.833
WHY NOT?

25:44.867 --> 25:48.233
BECAUSE I'M SOMEONE YOU NEED
TO GET TO KNOW TO LOVE.

25:48.267 --> 25:50.067
REALLY?
OH, YES.

25:50.067 --> 25:52.367
SO IF I KNOW YOU,
I'LL LOVE YOU?

25:52.400 --> 25:54.067
OH, YES.

25:54.067 --> 25:56.833
YOU REALLY LIKE YOURSELF, HUH?

25:56.867 --> 25:58.200
JUST HIDING MY PAIN.

25:58.233 --> 25:59.167
(laughs)

25:59.200 --> 26:00.833
(laughs)

26:00.867 --> 26:03.067
SO WHAT'S YOUR STORY?

26:04.633 --> 26:08.467
I DON'T HAVE A STORY.
I'M JUST A GIRL IN A BAR.

26:08.500 --> 26:10.667
I'M JUST A GUY
IN A BAR.

26:10.700 --> 26:13.067
***

26:13.067 --> 26:15.800
(clock ticking)

26:21.733 --> 26:24.733
(Alex) HOW DO YOU NOT KNOW
YOUR KID'S PREGNANT?

26:24.767 --> 26:26.667
YOU LOVE YOUR KIDS.

26:26.700 --> 26:28.533
YOU WANT TO SEE
THE BEST IN THEM.

26:28.567 --> 26:30.467
OKAY, THEN HOW
DO YOU HAVE A BABY

26:30.500 --> 26:32.767
AND THEN THROW IT
IN A TRASH CAN?

26:34.433 --> 26:38.800
SOMETHING HAPPENS,
AND YOU PANIC.

26:38.833 --> 26:41.133
YOU FREEZE,
AND YOU WANT TO HIDE IT

26:41.167 --> 26:44.833
AND... PRETEND
LIKE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

26:44.867 --> 26:46.633
I GET THAT.

26:46.667 --> 26:48.133
YOU GET THAT?

26:48.167 --> 26:49.533
I DO.

26:49.567 --> 26:52.600
I JUST DON'T GET
WHAT HAPPENS AFTERWARD.

26:52.633 --> 26:56.167
I DON'T GET HOW...
YOU GO BACK TO CLASS

26:56.200 --> 26:58.467
AND PRETEND
LIKE EVERYTHING'S FINE.

26:58.500 --> 27:00.800
EVERYTHING'S NOT FINE.

27:07.133 --> 27:09.600
OH, IT'S THE BLOOD RESULTS.

27:09.633 --> 27:11.533
KAREN AND LISA
ARE NOT A MATCH.

27:11.567 --> 27:13.500
AND THEN THERE WERE TWO.

27:17.467 --> 27:19.367
MIRANDA...

27:19.400 --> 27:21.300
I-I'M FEELING BETTER,
A LOT BETTER.

27:21.333 --> 27:23.133
I THINK THE FEVER BROKE,
WHICH IS GOOD, RIGHT?

27:23.167 --> 27:25.200
THAT'S VERY GOOD, OMAR.

27:25.233 --> 27:26.733
HOW'S GISELLE?

27:26.767 --> 27:28.167
IS SHE ASKING FOR ME?

27:28.200 --> 27:32.600
OMAR, FOR GISELLE,
BEING EXPOSED TO THE PLAGUE,

27:32.633 --> 27:37.800
IT--IT COMPLICATED...
THINGS.

27:37.833 --> 27:40.500
COMPLICATED WHAT THINGS?

27:41.633 --> 27:45.567
WE DID EVERYTHING
WE C-COULD.

27:45.600 --> 27:47.833
NO.

27:47.867 --> 27:51.600
I'M SO SORRY... OMAR.
NO.

27:51.633 --> 27:52.800
NO. NO.
OMAR.

27:52.833 --> 27:54.733
NO. NO. NO!

27:54.767 --> 27:55.667
OMAR...

27:55.700 --> 27:57.667
(gasping)

27:57.700 --> 27:59.400
COME ON, BREATHE.

27:59.433 --> 28:02.433
(gasping)

28:02.467 --> 28:03.767
(Omar coughs)

28:03.800 --> 28:05.700
STOP! NO, NO, STOP.
HE'S HYPERVENTILATING.

28:05.733 --> 28:07.567
LOOK, I HAVE TO GO
IN THERE!

28:07.600 --> 28:09.133
YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE.

28:09.167 --> 28:10.467
SOMEBODY HAS TO GO IN.

28:10.500 --> 28:13.067
(gasping)

28:15.233 --> 28:16.733
OMAR!
(Omar) OH, GOD!

28:16.767 --> 28:18.067
OMAR!
NOT MY WIFE!

28:18.067 --> 28:19.800
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
I NEED MY WIFE!

28:19.833 --> 28:21.833
I NEED GISELLE.
I HAVE TO SAVE HER.

28:21.867 --> 28:23.500
I HAVE TO HELP HER.

28:23.533 --> 28:25.667
LET ME OUTTA HERE!

28:25.700 --> 28:27.267
OMAR, LOOK AT ME.

28:27.300 --> 28:30.567
OMAR... LOOK AT ME!

28:30.600 --> 28:34.067
LOOK, I NEED YOU TO PUT
YOUR HANDS AGAINST MY HAND.

28:34.067 --> 28:35.200
(gasping)
COME ON.

28:35.233 --> 28:37.567
OH, GOD.
MY BEAUTIFUL GISELLE...

28:37.600 --> 28:39.733
OMAR, LOOK AT MY HANDS.

28:39.767 --> 28:42.800
PUT YOUR HANDS
ON MY HANDS.

28:42.833 --> 28:45.500
COME ON.

28:45.533 --> 28:47.300
GOOD.

28:47.333 --> 28:48.700
GOOD.

28:48.733 --> 28:50.533
(exhales) OKAY.

28:50.567 --> 28:52.500
LOOK AT ME. LOOK AT ME.

28:52.533 --> 28:56.400
CAN YOU TELL ME MY NAME?
DO YOU REMEMBER MY NAME?

28:56.433 --> 28:57.400
MIRANDA.

28:57.433 --> 29:00.300
MIRANDA. THAT'S RIGHT.

29:02.100 --> 29:04.200
I WANT GISELLE.

29:05.600 --> 29:06.800
I HAVE TO SAVE HER.

29:06.833 --> 29:08.467
PLEASE HELP.

29:08.500 --> 29:10.767
PLEASE... LET ME OUTTA HERE.

29:12.467 --> 29:15.433
I WISH
I COULD HELP YOU, OMAR.

29:15.467 --> 29:17.233
I WISH I COULD

29:17.267 --> 29:19.167
TURN BACK THE CLOCK
AND MAKE IT YESTERDAY.

29:19.200 --> 29:21.267
YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH I WISH THAT,

29:21.300 --> 29:24.133
BUT, UH...

29:24.167 --> 29:26.467
I CAN'T TURN BACK TIME.

29:26.500 --> 29:28.400
OH, I SHOULDN'T
HAVE LET HER DRIVE.

29:28.433 --> 29:30.333
SHE WAS SICK.

29:30.367 --> 29:31.700
I SHOULD'VE TAKEN OVER.

29:31.733 --> 29:34.200
I KNOW.

29:34.233 --> 29:35.567
(sobs)

29:35.600 --> 29:37.500
COME ON. I KNOW. I...

29:37.533 --> 29:38.300
(sobbing)

29:38.333 --> 29:41.133
I SHOULDA TAKEN OVER, TOO,
BUT...

29:41.167 --> 29:42.400
(crying)

29:42.433 --> 29:45.633
WE CAN'T GO BACK.

29:45.667 --> 29:47.667
LOOK, EVEN IF I COULD
LET YOU OUTTA HERE,

29:47.700 --> 29:50.467
YOU CAN'T
HELP GISELLE NOW, OMAR.

29:56.667 --> 29:59.500
DO YOU BELIEVE IN GOD,
MIRANDA?

29:59.533 --> 30:01.833
HUH? DO YOU...

30:01.867 --> 30:04.067
DO YOU BELIEVE
IN THE AFTERLIFE?

30:04.100 --> 30:06.200
(sobs)

30:06.233 --> 30:08.233
I HAVE TO BELIEVE.

30:08.267 --> 30:09.167
(sobs)

30:09.200 --> 30:13.100
WITH WHAT I DO, OMAR,
I HAVE TO BELIEVE

30:13.133 --> 30:15.500
THAT WHEN OUR TIME COMES

30:15.533 --> 30:18.200
THAT WE GO TO...

30:18.233 --> 30:20.667
A PLACE, A...

30:20.700 --> 30:23.167
A BEAUTIFUL PLACE, A...

30:23.200 --> 30:26.833
A BETTER PLACE.

30:26.867 --> 30:29.133
OMAR...

30:33.133 --> 30:34.733
THAT WOMAN DIED.

30:34.767 --> 30:36.533
SHE ACTUALLY DIED.

30:36.567 --> 30:38.400
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
WE WILL.

30:38.433 --> 30:40.200
IS IT HOT IN HERE?
NO.

30:40.233 --> 30:41.567
THEN WHY AM I SWEATING?

30:41.600 --> 30:42.700
BECAUSE YOU'RE PACING.

30:42.733 --> 30:44.367
NO, MY PULSE IS RAPID.

30:44.400 --> 30:45.567
BECAUSE YOU'RE STILL PACING.

30:45.600 --> 30:47.500
HERE, FEEL ME.
NO, I'M NOT GONNA FEEL YOU.

30:47.533 --> 30:49.300
SERIOUSLY.
SERIOUSLY, NO.

30:49.333 --> 30:50.633
YOU KNOW...

30:50.667 --> 30:52.167
YOU'RE AN ASS.

30:52.200 --> 30:53.133
(laughs)

30:53.167 --> 30:55.267
YOU'VE LIVED.
YOU'VE DONE THINGS.

30:55.300 --> 30:57.733
AND YOU GOT THE HAIR
AND THE HOT WIFE

30:57.767 --> 31:00.633
AND THE BEAUTIFUL EX-MISTRESS
WHO PINES FOR YOU.

31:00.667 --> 31:02.667
SHE'S PINING FOR ME?

31:02.700 --> 31:04.700
MY POINT IS YOU'VE LIVED.
IF YOU DIE, WHO CARES?

31:04.733 --> 31:07.600
IF I DIE...

31:07.633 --> 31:09.367
WHAT, THIS IS IT?

31:10.567 --> 31:13.433
CALLIE TOLD ME SHE LOVED ME.
I JUST SAT THERE.

31:13.467 --> 31:16.333
I MEAN, I WASN'T READY...

31:16.367 --> 31:18.233
BUT WHAT, NOW I'M GONNA DIE,

31:18.267 --> 31:20.167
AND I'M NOT EVEN
GONNA GET A CHANCE

31:20.200 --> 31:22.400
TO SAY "I LOVE YOU" BACK?

31:24.100 --> 31:26.200
WELL, DO YOU?

31:26.233 --> 31:27.500
DO YOU LOVE HER?

31:27.533 --> 31:29.667
MAYBE.

31:29.700 --> 31:33.767
EVENTUALLY... I COULD.

31:33.800 --> 31:35.667
YEAH, ONE DAY, SOONISH.

31:35.700 --> 31:37.367
"SOONISH"?

31:37.400 --> 31:40.067
I WILL LOVE YOU "SOONISH"?

31:40.100 --> 31:41.167
(laughs)

31:43.200 --> 31:45.367
YOU EVER TELL MEREDITH?

31:45.400 --> 31:48.300
YOU EVER TELL HER
THAT YOU LOVE HER?

31:51.633 --> 31:53.567
NO.

31:53.600 --> 31:56.467
I DID.

31:56.500 --> 32:00.100
BUT...

32:00.133 --> 32:01.367
I...

32:01.400 --> 32:03.533
I'M WITH CALLIE...

32:03.567 --> 32:06.667
AND... IT'S DIFFERENT,

32:06.700 --> 32:08.633
BUT...

32:08.667 --> 32:11.067
YOU SHOULD TELL HER.

32:12.833 --> 32:14.733
EVEN IF IT'S SOONISH,

32:14.767 --> 32:18.133
YOU SHOULD TELL HER
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

32:18.167 --> 32:21.200
YOU MEAN BEFORE I DIE
OF THE PLAGUE?

32:21.233 --> 32:23.467
BEFORE SOMEBODY ELSE
COMES ALONG.

32:25.600 --> 32:27.767
(Callie laughs)
THAT I BELIEVE.

32:27.800 --> 32:29.333
(clears throat)

32:29.367 --> 32:30.700
OH, UH... I'M GONNA...

32:30.733 --> 32:33.600
I'M GONNA LEAVE THE ROOM
FOR A PERIOD OF TIME

32:33.633 --> 32:35.467
FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER.

32:38.167 --> 32:40.367
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT...

32:40.400 --> 32:42.133
BETWEEN YOU AND DEREK.

32:42.167 --> 32:43.100
FINN--

32:43.133 --> 32:45.067
AND I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

32:45.067 --> 32:48.767
ALL RIGHT, WE NEVER SAID
THAT WE WERE EXCLUSIVE.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.633
BUT YOU HAVE PLANS.

32:50.667 --> 32:53.700
YEAH. WELL, I DIDN'T SAY
I WASN'T PISSED OFF.

32:53.733 --> 32:56.400
I SAID WE WEREN'T EXCLUSIVE.

32:56.433 --> 32:58.533
THAT'S ALL
I WANTED TO SAY.

33:00.500 --> 33:03.067
OH, AND, UH, AND THIS--

33:03.067 --> 33:06.467
I-I KNOW YOU THINK
YOU'RE SCARY AND DAMAGED.

33:06.500 --> 33:08.200
DARK AND TWISTY.

33:08.233 --> 33:11.100
IT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU DON'T DESERVE GOOD THINGS.

33:11.133 --> 33:13.067
BUT YOU DO.

33:13.067 --> 33:15.367
AND DEREK...

33:15.400 --> 33:17.633
HE'S BAD FOR YOU.

33:17.667 --> 33:19.567
BUT ME--
I'M A GOOD THING.

33:19.600 --> 33:22.467
AND IF THERE'S A RACE,
IF THERE IS A-A RING,

33:22.500 --> 33:25.267
MY HAT IS IN.

33:30.800 --> 33:33.500
I MADE AN APPOINTMENT
FOR A REASON.

33:33.533 --> 33:35.067
I SCHEDULED THE TIME

33:35.067 --> 33:36.800
BECAUSE I HAD
SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO SAY,

33:36.833 --> 33:38.700
AND YOU MADE ME WAIT.

33:38.733 --> 33:40.633
I HAVE A SITUATION, ADELE.
YOU DON'T--

33:40.667 --> 33:42.567
I'VE SPENT MY LIFE WAITING,

33:42.600 --> 33:44.500
WAITING FOR YOU
TO FINISH MED SCHOOL,

33:44.533 --> 33:46.433
WAITING FOR YOU
TO COME HOME AT NIGHT,

33:46.467 --> 33:48.267
WAITING FOR YOU TO LEAVE
THAT... WOMAN.

33:48.300 --> 33:51.067
I'M DONE WAITING.
ADELE--

33:51.100 --> 33:54.067
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO MAKE
A CHOICE--ME OR THIS HOSPITAL.

33:54.100 --> 33:56.533
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO RETIRE, RICHARD.

34:02.367 --> 34:06.333
(Addison) THERE HE IS.
THAT'S YOUR SON.

34:06.367 --> 34:09.733
I WANT YOU BOTH
TO LOOK AT HIM...

34:09.767 --> 34:12.333
BECAUSE IT'S NOT TRUE
THAT YOU DID NOTHING WRONG.

34:12.367 --> 34:13.833
YOU BOTH ARE WRONG.

34:13.867 --> 34:15.767
YOU'RE WRONG
FOR COVERING THIS UP.

34:15.800 --> 34:17.700
YOU'RE WRONG
FOR LYING ABOUT IT.

34:17.733 --> 34:20.367
YOU'RE WRONG FOR LETTING
THIS LITTLE BABY,

34:20.400 --> 34:22.533
THIS SWEET, INNOCENT,
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE BOY

34:22.567 --> 34:24.633
SUFFER LIKE THIS.

34:24.667 --> 34:27.500
HE'S DYING,
AND IT'S YOUR FAULT.

34:27.533 --> 34:29.433
IT'S BOTH OF YOUR FAULT.

34:29.467 --> 34:30.800
AND THE THING IS,

34:30.833 --> 34:33.333
THE TRUTH WILL COME OUT.

34:33.367 --> 34:36.633
IN TIME, IT WILL COME OUT.
IT ALWAYS DOES.

34:36.667 --> 34:39.800
IT JUST...

34:39.833 --> 34:42.367
IT JUST DOES.

34:43.800 --> 34:45.733
AND WHEN IT DOES,

34:45.767 --> 34:47.700
THIS BABY WILL BE DEAD.

34:54.533 --> 34:56.800
SHANNON...

34:59.233 --> 35:01.633
DON'T TELL MY MOM, OKAY?

35:05.867 --> 35:08.267
THANK YOU.

35:10.733 --> 35:13.267
THANK YOU
FOR TELLING THE TRUTH.

35:23.267 --> 35:25.700
YOU--YOU REALLY
DON'T FEEL ANYTHING?

35:25.733 --> 35:29.833
I ONLY FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN HERE
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

35:29.867 --> 35:31.767
I FEEL LIKE
I MIGHT BE TOO LATE.

35:31.800 --> 35:32.933
TOO LATE FOR WHAT?

35:32.967 --> 35:35.767
THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE
AND COOPERATION, DOCTORS.

35:35.800 --> 35:38.833
YOU'LL HAVE TO GO
ON A COURSE OF ANTIBIOTICS,

35:38.867 --> 35:40.500
BUT THE THREAT
HAS BEEN CONTAINED.

35:40.533 --> 35:42.433
GOOD.

35:42.467 --> 35:43.400
WHAT?

35:43.433 --> 35:46.100
YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

35:49.067 --> 35:50.400
(Addison) POOR LITTLE GUY.

35:50.433 --> 35:52.833
THE MINUTE HE'S OKAY,
WE HAVE TO TURN HIM OVER

35:52.867 --> 35:54.567
TO A MOTHER
WHO'S GOIN' TO JUVIE

35:54.600 --> 35:56.500
AND GRANDPARENTS
WHO ARE SO CLUELESS,

35:56.533 --> 36:00.300
THEY DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE
THEIR OWN KID WAS PREGNANT.

36:00.333 --> 36:03.200
IMAGINE THE KIND OF CHILDHOOD
HE'S GONNA HAVE.

36:03.233 --> 36:05.500
YOU CAN GET OVER
A BAD CHILDHOOD.

36:05.533 --> 36:06.633
(sighs)

36:06.667 --> 36:09.467
YOU CAN HAVE THE WORST CRAP
IN THE WORLD HAPPEN TO YOU,

36:09.500 --> 36:12.100
AND THEN
YOU CAN GET OVER IT.

36:12.133 --> 36:14.133
ALL YOU GOTTA DO
IS SURVIVE.

36:16.800 --> 36:18.667
HELLO?

36:20.500 --> 36:22.067
OH, MY GOD.

36:22.100 --> 36:24.233
OH, MY GOD.
I WAS SO WORRIED.

36:24.267 --> 36:25.267
(chuckles)

36:25.300 --> 36:27.133
BUT I'M--I'M FINE.

36:27.167 --> 36:28.600
I WAS REALLY,
REALLY WORRIED.

36:28.633 --> 36:30.133
YEAH, I KNOW. ME, TOO.

36:30.167 --> 36:33.800
GEORGE, I REALLY,
REALLY LOVE YOU.

36:57.233 --> 36:59.333
HI.

36:59.367 --> 37:01.267
HI.

37:01.300 --> 37:04.200
UH, I WAS GONNA COME OVER
THIS MORNING, BUT, UH--

37:04.233 --> 37:06.133
I HEARD--THE QUARANTINE.

37:06.167 --> 37:08.067
YEAH.

37:11.067 --> 37:13.400
(clears throat)

37:21.433 --> 37:24.300
SO... WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

37:24.333 --> 37:28.667
IT MEANS YOU HAVE
A CHOICE.

37:28.700 --> 37:31.433
YOU HAVE A CHOICE
TO MAKE.

37:31.467 --> 37:33.367
AND I DON'T WANT TO RUSH YOU

37:33.400 --> 37:35.767
INTO MAKING A DECISION
BEFORE YOU'RE READY.

37:35.800 --> 37:37.700
THIS MORNING,
I WAS GONNA COME OVER

37:37.733 --> 37:40.067
AND I WAS GONNA SAY--

37:40.067 --> 37:41.800
WHAT I WANTED TO SAY WAS...

37:41.833 --> 37:43.433
(clears throat)

37:43.467 --> 37:46.367
BUT NOW
ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT...

37:49.700 --> 37:53.133
I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU.

37:53.167 --> 37:57.333
I'VE BEEN IN LOVE
WITH YOU FOR... EVER.

37:57.367 --> 37:58.700
I'M A LITTLE LATE.

37:58.733 --> 38:01.600
I KNOW I'M A LITTLE LATE
IN TELLING YOU THAT.

38:01.633 --> 38:04.567
***

38:04.600 --> 38:06.467
I-I JUST...

38:06.500 --> 38:09.333
I JUST WANT YOU
TO TAKE YOUR TIME...

38:09.367 --> 38:11.067
YOU KNOW?

38:11.100 --> 38:13.667
TAKE ALL THE TIME
YOU NEED.

38:13.700 --> 38:18.400
BECAUSE YOU HAVE...
A CHOICE TO MAKE.

38:20.333 --> 38:22.633
AND WHEN I HAD
A CHOICE TO MAKE...

38:22.667 --> 38:24.667
I CHOSE WRONG.

38:24.700 --> 38:28.067
***

38:31.867 --> 38:35.067
ALL RIGHT. GOOD NIGHT.

38:35.067 --> 38:39.067
***

38:39.100 --> 38:43.300
TIME FLIES.

38:43.333 --> 38:47.533
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO RETIRE,
ARE YOU?

38:47.567 --> 38:51.067
ADELE, YOU SPRING THIS
ON ME TODAY.

38:51.100 --> 38:53.300
I-I NEED MORE TIME.

38:53.333 --> 38:56.133
***

38:56.167 --> 38:59.067
I DON'T HAVE
ANY MORE TIME TO GIVE.

38:59.100 --> 39:02.467
TIME WAITS FOR NO MAN.

39:02.500 --> 39:05.367
***

39:08.633 --> 39:14.433
TIME HEALS ALL WOUNDS.

39:14.467 --> 39:16.667
***

39:16.700 --> 39:19.667
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN
ALL DAY?

39:19.700 --> 39:22.267
SITTING SHIVAH FOR DENNY.

39:23.533 --> 39:24.733
AHH.

39:24.767 --> 39:26.500
HOW ARE YOU?

39:26.533 --> 39:29.200
HOW ARE YOU?

39:29.233 --> 39:33.367
***

39:33.400 --> 39:34.600
(sobs)

39:34.633 --> 39:37.067
OH.

39:37.067 --> 39:38.267
(sniffles)

39:41.333 --> 39:42.267
(cries)

39:42.300 --> 39:44.067
OH.

39:45.267 --> 39:47.600
DON'T EVER DIE.

39:50.767 --> 39:53.733
I'LL DO MY BEST.

39:53.767 --> 39:55.367
SHH.

39:55.400 --> 40:02.100
ALL ANY OF US WANTS
IS MORE TIME...

40:02.133 --> 40:05.600
(clock ticks)

40:05.633 --> 40:07.167
GOOD NIGHT.

40:07.200 --> 40:10.467
***

40:10.500 --> 40:11.833
ISN'T THIS SO COOL?

40:11.867 --> 40:13.767
I MEAN,
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

40:13.800 --> 40:16.267
TOMORROW,
WE'RE GONNA BE SURGEONS.

40:16.300 --> 40:18.200
(clock ticks)

40:18.233 --> 40:21.200
TIME TO STAND UP...

40:21.233 --> 40:25.333
TIME TO GROW UP...

40:26.833 --> 40:29.567
I'M READY.

40:29.600 --> 40:31.733
OKAY.

40:31.767 --> 40:36.367
TIME TO LET GO...

40:36.400 --> 40:39.733
***

40:39.767 --> 40:45.567
TIME.
