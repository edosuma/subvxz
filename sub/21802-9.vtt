WEBVTT

00:10.760 --> 00:12.760
You didn't tell me you were going to
destroy their mission!

00:12.840 --> 00:16.760
I thought we were helping them.
You lied to me!

00:16.840 --> 00:19.200
Listen to me!
There are things you don't understand,

00:19.280 --> 00:20.600
very complicated things at play here.

00:21.280 --> 00:24.040
All right? All that matters is
that you did a great job.

00:24.120 --> 00:28.800
How exactly? I saw it on the news.
The entire project is dead.

00:28.880 --> 00:29.880
How could you?

00:29.960 --> 00:32.720
Hey, watch your tone when speaking
to the dean of the Greenhouse!

00:35.400 --> 00:37.840
Don't make me regret accepting you here.

00:43.440 --> 00:45.480

01:03.080 --> 01:05.440
So how is the new captain doing?

01:05.519 --> 01:08.280
[sighs] To be honest,
I didn't sleep at all last night.

01:08.360 --> 01:10.600
You suddenly felt the weight
of all the responsibility?

01:11.160 --> 01:12.680
Yeah. Little bit.

01:15.400 --> 01:18.040
Okay, fine, a lot. [Chuckles]
But I'll be fine.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.200
You'll be more than fine.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.160
- Right.
- I know it.

01:21.240 --> 01:23.760
Here. It's an official captain's Louie.

01:23.840 --> 01:26.120
You can unlock and open
the clubhouse doors

01:26.200 --> 01:27.440
without student passcodes.

01:27.520 --> 01:30.240
- [Louie chimes]
- And it can activate and deactivate

01:30.320 --> 01:32.880
other students' Louies
in case of an emergency.

01:33.560 --> 01:34.560
So cool!

01:36.480 --> 01:40.040
Sophie, you're gonna find a lot of
people wanting to give you advice.

01:40.760 --> 01:44.640
So my advice to you is
always listen to yourself.

01:45.560 --> 01:48.160
Well, I was nervous before, but now...

01:49.040 --> 01:50.320
No pressure, right?

01:50.400 --> 01:52.120
- I believe in you.
- [chuckles]

01:52.200 --> 01:54.360
And I'm here for you. Always.

01:55.640 --> 01:57.400
Thanks, Louis.

01:57.480 --> 01:59.360
I really appreciate it.

02:04.920 --> 02:07.080
I am very happy with the Eagles' choice.

02:10.720 --> 02:13.480
Oh, what happened with Emma last night?
What did she want?

02:13.560 --> 02:17.840
Oh, uh, too many Ravens,
not enough computers in the lab.

02:18.720 --> 02:22.960
I suggested they put up a sign-up sheet
with designated times to avoid gridlock.

02:23.520 --> 02:24.760
Good job, son.

02:30.760 --> 02:32.160
We're all over the news. Did you see?

02:32.240 --> 02:33.880
- I did.
- Good.

02:33.960 --> 02:36.520
Now there's only have one thing left
for us to take care of.

02:36.600 --> 02:37.880
You know what to do.

02:37.960 --> 02:39.520
I'll take care of it.

02:41.440 --> 02:42.520
[sighs]

02:59.320 --> 03:00.400
Hi.

03:02.160 --> 03:06.640
- What are you writing?
- Um, a letter to my parents.

03:06.720 --> 03:07.720
[chuckles]

03:08.480 --> 03:11.440
Why not e-mail? It's faster.

03:11.520 --> 03:14.160
Hmm. But it's not as personal.

03:15.280 --> 03:18.800
You know, when I was in elementary
school, my mom worked two jobs

03:18.880 --> 03:21.720
and came back home
only after I was already asleep.

03:22.280 --> 03:24.480
So, each morning when I woke up,

03:24.560 --> 03:29.000
I found a letter from her on my pillow
telling me how her day had been.

03:29.080 --> 03:31.280
And when I got into the Greenhouse,

03:31.360 --> 03:33.640
I promised to write her
a letter every day.

03:35.920 --> 03:37.480
[chuckles softly]

03:38.920 --> 03:41.200
[stammers] So what are you
writing her about?

03:42.520 --> 03:45.400
Uh, did you tell her
about the satellite?

03:46.560 --> 03:47.800
Not yet.

03:49.280 --> 03:50.120
Ooh!

03:50.200 --> 03:52.240
[Tammy] Sophie, where have you been?
I was looking for you.

03:52.320 --> 03:55.320
- There's a problem with the boys' lockers.
- What is it?

03:56.080 --> 03:59.640
They stink! I found this
next to my toothbrush this morning.

03:59.720 --> 04:02.040
- Ew.
- I'm so over cleaning up after them.

04:03.840 --> 04:06.600
You're right. I'll talk to them.

04:07.600 --> 04:09.600
- [video game beeping]
- [Sophie] Hey, guys.

04:09.680 --> 04:12.440
I wanna talk to you guys
about the mess in your lockers.

04:12.520 --> 04:15.720
- Ooh, 5-3!
- It ain't over. It ain't over.

04:15.800 --> 04:16.800
Parker.

04:16.880 --> 04:18.320
[chuckling]

04:20.600 --> 04:21.720
Yo!

04:22.520 --> 04:23.680
What'd you do that for?

04:23.760 --> 04:25.240
Did you hear what I just said?

04:25.320 --> 04:27.920
I want you guys to pitch in
and clean up your lockers.

04:28.480 --> 04:30.840
- Someone's new jacket's got to her head.
- [laughing]

04:30.920 --> 04:33.160
[Tammy] You guys need to listen to her!
What's wrong with you?

04:33.240 --> 04:34.840
[Parker mockingly]
"Oh, what's wrong with you?"

04:34.920 --> 04:36.360
[Alex chuckling]

04:36.440 --> 04:39.200
- [Parker] Come on, Seth. Get it.
- [Seth] I'm trying, but it's killing me.

04:40.040 --> 04:42.200
Sophie, come on.

04:42.280 --> 04:44.880
They'll clean, then you'll just say
it's not really clean.

04:44.960 --> 04:46.560
What's the point?
You know we're not good at it.

04:47.200 --> 04:48.800
Why? Because you're men?

04:50.160 --> 04:52.760
[scoffs] Really? Come on,
I thought this was the 21st century.

04:52.840 --> 04:54.600
[sighs] Sophie, listen.

04:55.160 --> 04:57.320
It's not good to go
tough on them right now.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.640
Give them a chance to get used to you.

04:59.720 --> 05:02.720
You know what? Let's go.
It's time for practice anyway.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.280
- [Alex] Right.
- No.

05:04.360 --> 05:07.840
No one's leaving until you finish
cleaning up your lockers.

05:07.920 --> 05:09.800
Let us think about that for a second.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.840
- No.
- [laughing]

05:14.320 --> 05:17.000
But it's an order
from your captain, Parker.

05:17.720 --> 05:18.560
[scoffs]

05:19.640 --> 05:21.400
You're just gonna let them go?

05:21.480 --> 05:23.240
[Daniel sighs] She crazy.

05:25.240 --> 05:26.880
Nobody's going anywhere.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.920
- [Louie chimes]
- [doorknob rattling]

05:29.680 --> 05:31.440
[Parker] Don't worry, guys. I got this.

05:32.640 --> 05:33.680
[scoffs]

05:35.640 --> 05:37.040
It's no use, guys.

05:38.400 --> 05:40.560
I deactivated your Louies.

05:41.680 --> 05:45.120
I'm your captain, and when I ask you
to do something, you do it.

05:45.920 --> 05:48.640
- You knew the captain could do this?
- No.

05:58.640 --> 06:00.280
[chiming]

06:04.920 --> 06:05.920
You're late.

06:06.720 --> 06:09.800
- Did anyone see you coming in?
- Of course not.

06:09.880 --> 06:11.240
Did you get everything I asked for?

06:20.440 --> 06:22.480
Marcus, where'd you go?

06:25.280 --> 06:26.640
What is she doing here?

06:34.480 --> 06:38.160
Collaboration Teamwork Dynamics Seminar?
Is this gonna be boring?

06:38.240 --> 06:40.680
- Beats me.
- [Suzanne] Welcome, Ravens!

06:41.240 --> 06:43.200
Anyone have issues with heights?

06:43.880 --> 06:46.440
- Actually...
- Other than Max, I meant.

06:46.520 --> 06:49.600
- [students chuckling]
- Today's seminar is about collaboration.

06:49.680 --> 06:52.600
A good leader knows how to work
effectively with his or her team.

06:53.360 --> 06:55.560
What's all this have to do
with climbing a wall?

06:55.640 --> 06:57.160
You'll work in pairs.

06:57.240 --> 06:59.320
One partner will climb
this wall blindfolded

06:59.400 --> 07:01.320
while the other partner
will be his guide.

07:01.400 --> 07:02.880
Your job is simple. To get to the top.

07:02.960 --> 07:04.760
Suzanne, the thing is,

07:04.840 --> 07:07.720
I have a problem with the calcium
crystals in my inner ears...

07:07.800 --> 07:10.440
You'll be fine, Max. Don't worry.
We have harnesses and helmets

07:10.520 --> 07:12.200
to keep everyone from falling.

07:12.280 --> 07:14.720
So, who wants to be first?

07:15.720 --> 07:19.040
- Come on, Captain, I'll show you the way!
- [chuckles] Okay.

07:19.120 --> 07:21.800
- [chuckles]
- Actually, why don't you wear this?

07:24.240 --> 07:28.120
Okay, now just take your left arm
and move it up and to the left.

07:29.160 --> 07:31.160
Leo, there's nothing there!

07:31.240 --> 07:33.320
Hey, hey, it's fine, trust me.
You're doing great.

07:33.400 --> 07:35.240
Now just move your left arm up,

07:35.320 --> 07:37.480
just a little bit more, left,
you got this.

07:38.600 --> 07:42.880
There you go. Okay, okay,
now right hand and just a little bit up

07:42.960 --> 07:45.520
and to the right. Just a little bit...
Right there, you got it!

07:45.600 --> 07:48.800
Okay now take your left foot
and just bring it up a couple of inches.

07:48.880 --> 07:50.160
- [Hayley grunts]
- Perfect. You made it. You did it.

07:50.240 --> 07:51.600
[cheering]

07:52.960 --> 07:54.520
[Suzanne] Good job!

07:57.000 --> 08:00.040
I asked you to be careful.
And now look what you've done.

08:00.120 --> 08:01.400
She'll leave soon.

08:01.480 --> 08:02.880
Marcus?

08:02.960 --> 08:04.640
She knows too much.

08:04.720 --> 08:06.960
Come on, Judy.
She's just a curious kid.

08:07.040 --> 08:09.160
Yeah, too curious for her own good.

08:09.240 --> 08:11.280
Marcus, I know you can hear me!

08:11.360 --> 08:14.880
- You know what we have to do.
- Judy, no. Please...

08:14.960 --> 08:17.720
Do it. Now.

08:25.920 --> 08:29.440
- [sighs]
- You better hope she's not coming back.

08:30.360 --> 08:31.360
Now get to work.

08:32.240 --> 08:33.240
Now!

08:45.560 --> 08:47.520
Man, we should be at practice right now.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.320
Coach is gonna be so mad.

08:49.400 --> 08:52.040
Hey, cool. Here, take this.

08:52.120 --> 08:53.600
It helps remove stains.

08:55.920 --> 08:57.040
[sighs]

08:57.120 --> 08:58.680
[animal squeaking]

08:58.760 --> 08:59.920
Did you hear that?

09:01.560 --> 09:03.000
I didn't hear anything.

09:03.800 --> 09:04.800
[squeaking continues]

09:04.880 --> 09:06.960
What the heck?
It kinda sounds like it's coming...

09:07.040 --> 09:08.960
- It's probably just the sink. It's, like...
- What? What?

09:09.040 --> 09:12.120
- What is this? What?
- Wait, Sophie, listen, listen, listen.

09:12.200 --> 09:13.720
[Sophie gasps] Oh, my...

09:14.520 --> 09:16.000
What is this, Parker?

09:16.080 --> 09:18.160
- Just listen. Just one second.
- How long has it been here?

09:18.240 --> 09:21.480
[Parker] Only for a couple of days,
okay. He got lost in the Greenhouse.

09:21.560 --> 09:22.720
We saved him.

09:23.600 --> 09:26.200
So this is why your lockers
smelled so bad?

09:26.760 --> 09:29.160
You know we're not allowed
to keep animals in here.

09:29.240 --> 09:31.920
But look how cute he is.
Can I pet him?

09:32.000 --> 09:36.320
Why are you doing this to me?
No, no, no, we cannot keep it here.

09:36.400 --> 09:40.000
But look, he's... he's bonded with us,
and he loves being here.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.720
Yeah. He's definitely an Eagle.

09:43.280 --> 09:44.160
[Coach] Eagles!

09:44.840 --> 09:46.440
[rabbit squeaking]

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
You know you're late to practice.

09:51.840 --> 09:53.080
What's going on here?

09:56.440 --> 09:58.440
[Max panting] I can't find the grip!

09:58.520 --> 10:00.680
Oh, guys, I'm gonna fall, I'm
gonna fall, I'm gonna fall...

10:00.760 --> 10:02.160
Max, you're not listening to me.

10:02.240 --> 10:04.160
- Help!
- Stop yelling!

10:04.240 --> 10:06.120
I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die,
I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die!

10:06.200 --> 10:07.840
I have very brittle bones!

10:07.920 --> 10:11.160
You're gonna die of old age
if you don't start climbing!

10:11.240 --> 10:12.360
I want my mom!

10:12.440 --> 10:15.200
- [panting]
- [groans] Maximilian Miller,

10:15.280 --> 10:18.760
I am going to drag you up there myself
if you don't start moving.

10:18.840 --> 10:21.480
- How much further?
- You're only, like, five feet up!

10:22.080 --> 10:23.400
- [shrieks] What?
- [all laugh]

10:24.360 --> 10:25.880
Come on, Max! You can do it!

10:25.960 --> 10:27.880
[all cheering]

10:29.280 --> 10:31.520
Max, focus!

10:31.600 --> 10:35.080
Just move your right foot!
That's all you have to do!

10:35.160 --> 10:37.600
- Move my foot where?
- To the right!

10:37.680 --> 10:39.200
My right or your right?

10:39.280 --> 10:43.200
- That doesn't even make any sense!
- Stop yelling at me! [Cries]

10:43.760 --> 10:47.760
Max! Max. This is Emma. Okay,
take a deep breath. You're doing fine.

10:48.320 --> 10:51.480
Raise your left hand
at a 30-degree angle

10:51.560 --> 10:54.640
and place it about seven inches
to the right.

10:55.520 --> 10:56.800
[panting]

10:57.640 --> 10:59.200
[Emma] That's really good, Max.

10:59.280 --> 11:04.000
Now you want to lower your right foot
southwest about two inches

11:04.080 --> 11:05.800
above the level of your left foot.

11:06.600 --> 11:09.920
[Max panting] That was very
precise, Emma. Thank you.

11:12.280 --> 11:15.120
[grunting] I think I can make it.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.520
- [all cheering]
- [boy] Way to go, Miller!

11:17.600 --> 11:19.800
[girl] Yeah! Way to go!

11:20.560 --> 11:21.600
You got this, buddy.

11:23.040 --> 11:25.400
Captain, why are my
boys late to practice?

11:25.960 --> 11:28.480
Sir, I was just having them
clean up their lockers.

11:31.680 --> 11:34.680
Good for you.
Discipline's important for athletes.

11:36.440 --> 11:37.360
What's this?

11:38.400 --> 11:40.480
Oh, that's just garbage.

11:41.880 --> 11:45.720
- All righty. Remember to recycle it.
- Yeah.

11:45.800 --> 11:48.160
- Let's keep the Greenhouse green!
- [Sophie] Sure thing.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.120
- Thanks, Coach.
- Sir.

11:50.840 --> 11:53.200
[sighs] Thank you, Sophie.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.840
Listen, guys...

11:54.920 --> 11:56.080
[rabbit squeaking]

11:56.160 --> 11:59.760
Oh, my God, the rabbit is adorable
but we can't keep him here.

11:59.840 --> 12:01.920
We're gonna have to
give him up for adoption.

12:03.640 --> 12:07.200
Raise your right foot at a 45-degree
angle about seven inches. Perfect.

12:07.280 --> 12:11.840
Now raise your right hand
4.7 inches directly above you.

12:11.920 --> 12:15.520
Good. Now with your left foot...
Good, so you figured out the pattern.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.520
Yeah. These holding grips
are in a triangular pattern.

12:17.600 --> 12:19.720
A triangular pattern. Yeah. [Chuckles]

12:19.800 --> 12:22.360
- So how's the new seminar going, Suzanne?
- [Max gasps] Careful!

12:22.440 --> 12:23.800
- [girl] Emma! Emma, careful!
- [boy] Emma!

12:23.880 --> 12:25.160
[Jackie] Is she okay?

12:25.240 --> 12:26.400
Careful, Emma.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.760
- Are you okay?
- Don't want to hurt yourself.

12:31.360 --> 12:32.360
- Isn't he perfect?
- He's so cute.

12:32.440 --> 12:34.560
Thanks for letting me know. Bye.

12:35.600 --> 12:38.200
Hey, guys. So I just spoke to Louis,

12:38.280 --> 12:41.320
and he gave me directions
to the humane shelter.

12:41.960 --> 12:43.240
A humane shelter?

12:43.320 --> 12:45.760
Come on, please don't make this harder
than it already is.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.880
[gasps] Oh. Who's this cutie?

12:52.440 --> 12:54.760
His name's Steph. After Steph Curry.

12:55.320 --> 12:57.880
- You guys gave him a name?
- Yeah.

12:57.960 --> 13:00.200
The boys found him but now
we have to give him away, right?

13:00.280 --> 13:02.480
Do we really know these people
at the shelter?

13:02.560 --> 13:04.560
Right, they could cook Steph
the minute we leave.

13:04.640 --> 13:06.080
- [Eagles groan]
- Don't say that.

13:06.160 --> 13:09.360
- No one's going to cook anyone.
- Are you sure we can't keep him, Soph?

13:09.440 --> 13:10.600
At least until after our next game.

13:10.680 --> 13:14.000
No, absolutely not.
No, I... I just got off the phone...

13:16.120 --> 13:19.480
Wait. Parker,
I think you're onto something.

13:20.920 --> 13:22.040
What did I say?

13:22.120 --> 13:26.680
Okay, so the rules against pets apply
only to the Greenhouse premises, right?

13:26.760 --> 13:27.760
Yeah.

13:27.840 --> 13:29.840
So what if Steph became
our official Eagles mascot?

13:29.920 --> 13:31.600
- That could work.
- That's not a bad idea.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.760
- Right, what do you think?
- Yes, Sophie.

13:33.840 --> 13:36.360
- Okay, cool. I'm calling Louis right now.
- [chuckling]

13:36.440 --> 13:38.240
[Parker] Yeah, and we'll put some
eagle wings on him.

13:38.320 --> 13:39.960
[indistinct chatter]

13:40.040 --> 13:41.520
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:41.600 --> 13:42.640
Where have you been?

13:42.720 --> 13:45.240
Oh, just, you know,
checking out some stuff.

13:45.320 --> 13:47.400
- Some stuff?
- Yeah.

13:47.480 --> 13:49.120
Well, what kind of stuff?

13:49.200 --> 13:51.360
It's nothing. Not important.

13:51.440 --> 13:53.680
- Not important.
- [Sophie] Thank you, thank you, thank you.

13:53.760 --> 13:56.400
You won't regret it, I promise.
Guys, Louis said yes!

13:56.480 --> 13:58.320
[cheering]

13:58.880 --> 14:03.000
Rabbit, we name you Steph,
the official Eagles mascot!

14:03.080 --> 14:04.200
[cheering]

14:04.280 --> 14:10.360
[chanting] Go, Steph! Go, Steph!
Go, Steph! Go, Steph! Go, Steph!

14:13.120 --> 14:16.920
Hey, Brooke. So what stuff
were you checking out?

14:18.480 --> 14:21.560
Come on. You know you can
tell me anything. What's up?

14:22.360 --> 14:24.200
It's Marcus.

14:25.520 --> 14:28.480
Um, he's been acting weird lately.

14:29.240 --> 14:32.120
Marcus... the maintenance guy?

14:32.200 --> 14:35.920
He's not just a maintenance guy.
He's a family friend,

14:36.000 --> 14:39.160
and I was asking him something
about the engine fire.

14:39.240 --> 14:40.520
What?

14:40.600 --> 14:45.240
The point is, when I mentioned your mom,
he got completely weird.

14:45.320 --> 14:47.520
My mom? Why would you bring her up?

14:47.600 --> 14:51.720
I think your mom knows something
about this whole car accident.

14:52.760 --> 14:54.880
You think my mom had something
to do with that?

14:54.960 --> 14:57.440
I'm not saying she blew up the car.
That's ridiculous.

14:57.520 --> 15:00.520
Yeah. She barely even knows
how to operate a microwave oven.

15:00.600 --> 15:03.560
I don't think she did it by herself.
Someone obviously helped her.

15:05.320 --> 15:09.080
[sighs] Brooke. This is my mom.

15:09.160 --> 15:13.520
I know, but you gotta admit she was a bit
obsessed with the Taser barb evidence.

15:13.600 --> 15:17.040
Because she was trying to protect me!
I mean, she'd do anything for me.

15:17.120 --> 15:19.040
I know. That's my whole point, Daniel.

15:19.120 --> 15:21.200
So you have a point. I see.

15:21.280 --> 15:24.560
Listen, Marcus started acting weird
when I mentioned your mother,

15:24.640 --> 15:27.720
and then I was looking out the window
and I saw him walking off campus

15:27.800 --> 15:30.480
towards the ocean.
So I followed him and...

15:31.360 --> 15:32.680
and then he disappeared.

15:34.840 --> 15:35.920
Disappeared?

15:36.000 --> 15:39.080
Yes. Something's going on here, Daniel,
I'm telling you.

15:39.160 --> 15:41.560
And I think your mom might know
something about it.

15:43.440 --> 15:44.440
I can't believe you.

15:45.840 --> 15:49.800
I almost lost my leg. I don't know when
I'll be able to play basketball again.

15:49.880 --> 15:52.200
Your dad humiliated me
in front of everyone.

15:52.280 --> 15:55.920
You went behind my back to campaign
for Sophie instead of Parker.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.320
And now you're picking on my mom?

15:57.400 --> 15:59.360
- No. I'm not picking on her.
- You are.

16:00.320 --> 16:02.440
My mom sacrificed everything for me.

16:02.520 --> 16:05.040
Who I am today is because of her.

16:06.520 --> 16:09.440
I won't let you
or anyone else disrespect her.

16:22.840 --> 16:24.760
[line ringing]

16:24.840 --> 16:28.560
This is Brandon Thomas, director of NASA.
Please leave a message after the tone.

16:28.640 --> 16:29.640
[voice mail beeps]

16:29.720 --> 16:33.280
Hello. I'd like to report an anonymous
tip about the missing satellite.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.400
I have some valuable information
about the...

16:35.480 --> 16:37.400
[Jason] Good evening, Mrs. Geller.

16:37.480 --> 16:40.320
This is Jason Osmond,
the dean of the Greenhouse.

16:41.240 --> 16:42.240
How are you?

16:43.040 --> 16:44.920
No, no, everything's just fine.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.400
I just wanted to let you know
how pleased we are with your daughter.

16:47.480 --> 16:51.280
You should let your husband know, too.
She's a real shining star.

16:52.360 --> 16:55.360
I know how much she adores you.
She talks about you a lot.

16:55.440 --> 16:59.440
So I just wanted to touch base with you
and give you a progress report.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.640
[chuckles] Thank you.

17:03.080 --> 17:04.118
Night.

17:24.839 --> 17:26.200
Have you seen Emma?

17:32.800 --> 17:34.280
Have you seen Emma anywhere?

17:38.920 --> 17:40.200
[Emma crying]

17:48.600 --> 17:51.560
Emma? Is that you?

17:54.680 --> 17:57.240
Keep crying.
[stammers] I mean, don't cry.

17:57.320 --> 17:59.520
Or... cry if it makes you feel better.

17:59.600 --> 18:02.240
Although I would prefer it
if you didn't cry.

18:03.320 --> 18:04.880
[Emma sniffling]

18:06.080 --> 18:09.040
- Do you want me to leave?
- [Emma] Yes, leave.

18:33.120 --> 18:35.280
[screams] You scared me!

18:35.360 --> 18:37.440
- Sorry, um...
- What are you doing here?

18:37.520 --> 18:38.880
I didn't mean to scare you.

18:38.960 --> 18:42.920
I... I heard you and Daniel
and I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.560
You looked really upset after dinner. I
just wanted to make sure you were okay.

18:46.640 --> 18:50.880
[chuckles] Thanks, Alex.
That's really sweet of you.

18:53.640 --> 18:55.120
This is where you saw Marcus?

18:57.720 --> 18:59.680
Okay, you look over there.
I'll look over here.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.520
Okay.

19:05.040 --> 19:06.280
[rattling]

19:06.360 --> 19:08.360
- Did you hear that?
- Shh!

19:27.600 --> 19:32.200
Hey, you're the missing park ranger.
I saw you on the news.

19:32.280 --> 19:33.880
Hey, man, are you okay?

19:33.960 --> 19:36.320
You. You did this to me.

19:36.400 --> 19:38.280
What? I didn't do anything. [Screams]
