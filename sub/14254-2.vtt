WEBVTT

00:04.070 --> 00:08.404
Captain's Log, Stardate 54129.4.

00:08.475 --> 00:11.273
lt's a bittersweet day
for the crew of Voyager.

00:11.344 --> 00:12.936
We've finally found a home

00:13.079 --> 00:15.274
for some
of our most precious cargo.

00:15.348 --> 00:18.283
Thank you again for taking care
of them, Captain.

00:18.351 --> 00:19.579
We're very grateful.

00:19.652 --> 00:21.586
We're just glad
that Rebi and Azan will have

00:21.654 --> 00:23.588
a chance to grow up
with their own people

00:23.656 --> 00:26.318
and that you've been kind enough
to let Mezoti join them.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.693
You can still come with us.

00:30.764 --> 00:33.164
And you can still
stay on Voyager.

00:33.233 --> 00:35.997
Adapting to your absence
will be difficult.

00:37.070 --> 00:38.662
l'll miss you, too.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.341
lt's time.

00:43.943 --> 00:45.934
l've been studying
all available data

00:46.012 --> 00:48.480
relevant to this species,
as you recommended.

00:48.548 --> 00:50.482
Familiarizing yourself
with their culture

00:50.550 --> 00:51.517
will help you adapt.

00:51.584 --> 00:55.020
On Wysanti, it's customary
not to say good-bye,

00:55.121 --> 00:57.783
but l think l prefer
the human way.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:22.015 --> 01:24.142
Energize.

01:34.627 --> 01:37.619
We should deactivate
the children's alcoves.

01:37.697 --> 01:38.959
Right now?

01:39.065 --> 01:41.966
They're a drain
on Voyager's power reserves.

01:42.068 --> 01:44.298
ls there a problem?

01:44.404 --> 01:46.065
lt just seems like

01:46.172 --> 01:50.108
an insufficient amount
of time has passed.

01:50.210 --> 01:52.678
You're having
an emotional response

01:52.745 --> 01:54.610
to the children's departure.

01:54.681 --> 01:55.613
They'll be fine.

01:55.682 --> 01:57.513
We should be happy for them.

01:57.584 --> 01:58.949
Seven?

01:59.018 --> 02:00.610
Yes?

02:00.687 --> 02:03.212
You're crying.

02:06.126 --> 02:10.222
My ocular implant
must be malfunctioning.

04:00.039 --> 04:02.200
Crying is nothing
to be ashamed of, Seven.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.402
You should have seen me

04:03.443 --> 04:06.241
the first time l heard
Puccini's Tosca in the holodeck.

04:06.312 --> 04:09.338
l sobbed through
the entire third act.

04:09.415 --> 04:11.178
You're a hologram.
You can't cry.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.878
Ordinarily,
but Lieutenant Torres

04:12.952 --> 04:14.749
enhanced
my emotional subroutines,

04:14.821 --> 04:17.346
so l could truly appreciate
the performance.

04:17.423 --> 04:18.890
Then your reaction
was the result

04:19.024 --> 04:20.458
of a technological enhancement,

04:20.526 --> 04:24.257
just as mine was the result
of a technological malfunction.

04:24.330 --> 04:27.026
Saying good-bye to the children
was a traumatic experience.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.068
Crying was a normal response.

04:29.135 --> 04:30.067
Except that l was

04:30.136 --> 04:31.603
in complete control
of my emotions.

04:37.176 --> 04:40.168
Hmm. lt seems
l owe you an apology.

04:40.246 --> 04:42.510
According to this,
your tears were the result

04:42.582 --> 04:44.743
of a glitch in your
primary cortical node.

04:44.817 --> 04:47.285
Have you experienced any
other malfunctions lately?

04:47.353 --> 04:49.651
Headache? Dizziness?
Diminished motor function?

04:49.722 --> 04:50.950
No.

04:51.057 --> 04:52.786
Really?

04:52.859 --> 04:54.952
Then you won't mind if l check

04:55.094 --> 04:58.621
the bio-monitors in your alcove
just to be sure?

04:58.698 --> 05:01.064
l've experienced
an occasional headache.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.499
Why didn't you come to see me?

05:02.602 --> 05:04.593
The malfunctions have
not affected my work.

05:04.704 --> 05:06.831
Seven, if you're
having problems,

05:06.973 --> 05:09.066
you need to let me know.

05:09.175 --> 05:11.143
lf it'll make you feel better,

05:11.244 --> 05:13.439
l'll be more forthcoming
in the future.

05:13.513 --> 05:15.105
You're all heart.

05:15.181 --> 05:17.775
l'll schedule
some follow-up tests

05:17.850 --> 05:19.613
and make my report
to the Captain.

05:19.686 --> 05:22.280
l'd prefer to keep this
between us.

05:22.355 --> 05:24.255
l don't want
to worry the Captain.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.986
We've always kept her informed
of your medical needs.

05:27.060 --> 05:30.086
lt was my understanding
that all members of this crew

05:30.163 --> 05:32.893
have the right to doctor-patient
confidentiality.

05:32.999 --> 05:36.594
lf you want to keep
this between us,

05:36.703 --> 05:39.171
that's where it'll stay.

05:59.292 --> 06:03.524
Have you finished charting
the nebula in Sector 949?

06:03.596 --> 06:05.860
Several hours ago.

06:12.171 --> 06:13.229
l've been thinking.

06:13.339 --> 06:15.637
While l'm grateful
for the opportunity

06:15.708 --> 06:17.403
to assist you in Astrometrics,

06:17.477 --> 06:20.446
l'd like to take on
more challenging assignments.

06:20.513 --> 06:22.845
l can assign you
additional diagnostics.

06:22.915 --> 06:24.507
That's not what l meant.

06:24.584 --> 06:26.518
l want to work on the Bridge.

06:26.586 --> 06:28.884
You don't have
the proper training.

06:28.988 --> 06:30.216
That's why l'd like to take

06:30.289 --> 06:32.450
the entrance exam
for Starfleet Academy.

06:34.026 --> 06:35.357
l could forward it to Earth

06:35.428 --> 06:36.986
in the next
datastream transmission.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.894
lf l pass, l could take
the basic classes

06:38.998 --> 06:40.192
from Commander Tuvok.

06:40.266 --> 06:42.894
He was an instructor
at the Academy.

06:43.002 --> 06:45.698
Your plan is ambitious.

06:45.805 --> 06:47.534
Then you think it's a good idea?

06:47.607 --> 06:50.235
You could take
the classes with me.

06:50.309 --> 06:53.073
Earn your own commission.

06:53.146 --> 06:54.477
l believe l've
already assimilated

06:54.547 --> 06:55.605
enough Starfleet training.

06:55.681 --> 06:58.206
l'll need a letter of
recommendation from the Captain.

06:58.284 --> 07:00.309
l'll speak to her.

07:06.726 --> 07:08.819
l have work to complete
in the cargo bay.

07:08.961 --> 07:10.019
Can you finish here?

07:10.096 --> 07:11.825
Of course.

07:24.677 --> 07:27.771
Computer, initiate
regeneration cycle.

07:29.148 --> 07:30.672
Unable to comply.

07:30.750 --> 07:31.808
Why?

07:31.884 --> 07:33.852
The interface is incompatible.

07:33.920 --> 07:37.515
Run a diagnostic of Alcove 01.

07:38.858 --> 07:40.587
Diagnostic complete.

07:40.660 --> 07:44.619
Alcove 01 is operating
within normal parameters.

07:44.697 --> 07:48.155
lnitiate regeneration cycle.

07:49.569 --> 07:50.831
Unable to comply.

07:50.937 --> 07:52.029
Clarify.

07:52.138 --> 07:55.130
Your cortical node
is malfunctioning.

08:05.017 --> 08:07.577
Seven. l didn't see you.

08:07.653 --> 08:09.712
l was just leaving.

08:09.789 --> 08:11.120
Before breakfast?

08:11.190 --> 08:13.784
What time is it?

08:13.860 --> 08:15.350
0500.

08:15.428 --> 08:19.057
Don't tell me you've
been here all night.

08:19.131 --> 08:21.361
l was unable to regenerate.

08:21.467 --> 08:23.435
Anything on your mind?

08:23.536 --> 08:27.233
My alcove is malfunctioning.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.638
Well, you should ask B'Elanna
to take a look at it.

08:29.709 --> 08:30.869
l didn't want to wake her.

08:30.943 --> 08:33.275
What's all this?

08:33.346 --> 08:35.871
Nutritional supplements.

08:35.982 --> 08:37.313
l thought they would compensate.

08:37.383 --> 08:39.510
Your own recipe?

08:39.585 --> 08:41.780
lt's a mixture
of metabolic enzymes

08:41.854 --> 08:43.150
and protein extract.

08:43.222 --> 08:45.281
Let me make you one
of my Talaxian omelets.

08:45.358 --> 08:48.486
lt may not have as many enzymes,
but it'll taste better.

08:48.561 --> 08:50.028
That won't be necessary.

08:50.096 --> 08:52.826
l think l'll take your advice
and wake Lieu...

08:52.899 --> 08:54.093
Lieutenant...

08:55.568 --> 08:56.899
Seven!

09:03.376 --> 09:04.468
Neelix to Sick Bay.

09:04.544 --> 09:05.636
Medical emergency.

09:18.991 --> 09:21.551
You lost consciousness
in the Mess Hall.

09:24.897 --> 09:27.593
Your body's begun
to reject your implants.

09:27.667 --> 09:30.033
l'm afraid it's a result
of that glitch we found

09:30.136 --> 09:31.194
in your cortical node.

09:31.304 --> 09:34.034
Apparently, it's more
serious than we thought.

09:37.176 --> 09:39.201
The node is destabilizing.

09:39.278 --> 09:42.270
lt's no longer able
to regulate your implants.

09:42.348 --> 09:44.509
They're shutting down
one by one.

09:45.618 --> 09:48.519
When you've disconnected
implants in the past,

09:48.588 --> 09:49.885
l've always adapted.

09:49.956 --> 09:51.981
Minor implants--

09:52.058 --> 09:53.753
an assimilation tubule here,

09:53.826 --> 09:55.316
a few nanoprobes there--

09:55.394 --> 09:57.885
nothing crucial
to your human physiology,

09:58.030 --> 10:01.124
but these implants control
your vital functions.

10:01.200 --> 10:04.294
And without my cortical node
to regulate them, l'll die.

10:04.403 --> 10:05.665
Correct?

10:13.012 --> 10:15.378
Borg technology
is highly adaptive.

10:15.448 --> 10:18.576
My cortical node
will repair itself in time.

10:18.651 --> 10:19.811
l don't think so, Seven.

10:19.885 --> 10:22.251
lf anything, the deterioration
is accelerating.

10:22.321 --> 10:24.448
You'll have to stay here
for observation.

10:24.523 --> 10:27.151
l think l've been
sufficiently observed.

10:27.226 --> 10:29.194
Would you excuse us, please?

10:31.931 --> 10:33.558
l'm sorry for what's happening.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.533
You have every right
to be angry,

10:35.635 --> 10:38.365
but that isn't going to
help us solve this problem.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.336
The node will correct itself.

10:40.406 --> 10:41.532
Suppose it doesn't?

10:41.641 --> 10:43.370
For the sake of argument.

10:43.442 --> 10:46.104
ls it possible
to replicate a new one?

10:46.178 --> 10:48.373
The technology is too complex.

10:50.282 --> 10:51.840
What if this had happened

10:51.917 --> 10:54.385
when you were part
of the collective?

10:54.453 --> 10:57.820
How would the Borg have
repaired the damage?

10:57.890 --> 11:00.051
They wouldn't have.

11:00.126 --> 11:03.721
Trying to repair a node
would be a futile exercise.

11:03.796 --> 11:06.162
The Borg would simply
replace it.

11:10.469 --> 11:13.461
Harry, we passed
a Borg debris field

11:13.572 --> 11:14.539
six or seven days ago

11:14.640 --> 11:16.631
just outside
the Yontasa Expanse.

11:16.742 --> 11:18.471
See if you can find it
on long-range sensors.

11:18.544 --> 11:19.602
Yes, ma'am.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.147
lt's not every day
we go looking for the Borg.

11:22.214 --> 11:23.545
What's up?

11:23.616 --> 11:25.777
Seven needs a new cortical node.

11:25.851 --> 11:27.614
Captain, need l remind you

11:27.687 --> 11:30.588
the Borg often return
to salvage damaged cubes.

11:30.656 --> 11:32.419
lt's a risk l'm willing to take.

11:32.491 --> 11:34.356
l want to help Seven
as much as anyone,

11:34.427 --> 11:35.621
but if we're not careful,

11:35.695 --> 11:37.492
we'll all end up
with cortical nodes.

11:37.563 --> 11:39.463
That's why l'm taking
the Flyer alone.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.466
l've located the debris field.

11:41.567 --> 11:43.535
Transmit the coordinates
to the Flyer.

11:43.636 --> 11:45.228
You have the Bridge, Commander.

11:45.337 --> 11:46.565
With all due respect...

11:46.672 --> 11:48.697
the last time you took
the Delta Flyer

11:48.808 --> 11:49.866
to confront the Borg,

11:49.975 --> 11:52.205
it ended up
in a couple thousand pieces.

11:52.278 --> 11:54.803
l intend to bring it back
in one piece this time.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.848
A good pilot might be
able to help you do that.

11:56.916 --> 11:58.781
Particularly if he's accompanied

11:58.851 --> 12:00.876
by an experienced
Tactical Officer.

12:00.953 --> 12:02.921
You shouldn't do this
by yourself, Captain.

12:05.791 --> 12:08.817
Well, then, gentlemen,
l guess you're with me.

12:17.269 --> 12:18.463
Captain.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.801
l'll meet you
in the Shuttle Bay.

12:20.873 --> 12:22.864
Have you talked to Seven?

12:22.975 --> 12:24.408
Just a few minutes ago.

12:24.477 --> 12:26.570
And you don't approve.

12:26.645 --> 12:27.942
Of what?

12:28.013 --> 12:29.207
My request.

12:29.281 --> 12:30.578
Request?

12:30.649 --> 12:33.140
l'm sure Seven will
discuss it with you

12:33.219 --> 12:34.777
when she has the chance.

12:34.854 --> 12:37.152
l'm sorry l bothered you.

12:37.223 --> 12:39.418
Obviously, no one's told you.

12:39.492 --> 12:41.084
Told me what?

12:41.160 --> 12:42.787
Seven isn't well.

12:42.862 --> 12:45.490
What's wrong with her?

12:45.564 --> 12:47.498
Her cortical node is failing.

12:47.566 --> 12:48.965
Her cortical node?

12:49.101 --> 12:50.762
She's going to die.

12:50.870 --> 12:52.428
Not if we find a new node.

12:52.538 --> 12:55.473
We're on our way to search
a Borg debris field.

12:55.541 --> 12:57.805
l have experience
in Borg technology.

12:57.877 --> 12:59.208
Let me come with you.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.610
l appreciate the offer,
but it's too dangerous.

13:01.680 --> 13:03.113
l'm willing to take the risk.

13:03.182 --> 13:04.547
l'm not willing to let you.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.381
l'll let you know how we did
as soon as we're back.

13:07.453 --> 13:08.943
Don't worry.

13:21.634 --> 13:22.896
Seven?

13:28.274 --> 13:29.673
Why are you here?

13:29.742 --> 13:31.937
The Captain told me
you were ill.

13:32.011 --> 13:33.137
l'm fine.

13:33.212 --> 13:34.702
Then why are you in Sick Bay?

13:34.780 --> 13:36.077
That's not your concern.

13:36.148 --> 13:37.479
You have work to complete.

13:37.550 --> 13:38.744
Report to Astrometrics.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.046
l've finished my work.

13:40.119 --> 13:41.552
Then l'll assign you more.

13:41.620 --> 13:43.451
ls there a problem?

13:43.522 --> 13:45.251
l wish to be alone.

13:45.324 --> 13:47.622
Come with me, please.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.625
Why is she so angry with me?

13:56.735 --> 13:58.532
She's not angry with you.

13:58.637 --> 13:59.865
She's just angry.

13:59.972 --> 14:01.371
l don't understand.

14:01.473 --> 14:03.839
lt's a common response
to serious illness.

14:03.909 --> 14:05.672
She's frustrated
to be confined,

14:05.744 --> 14:07.609
embarrassed
to appear vulnerable.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.875
She shouldn't be
embarrassed in front of me.

14:09.949 --> 14:11.041
l'm her friend.

14:11.116 --> 14:12.549
And her pupil.

14:12.618 --> 14:14.779
She doesn't want you
or anyone else to see her

14:14.854 --> 14:16.116
when she's not at her best.

14:16.188 --> 14:17.621
lt's not her fault
that she's sick.

14:17.690 --> 14:18.884
Of course not,

14:18.991 --> 14:21.289
but we have to allow
her to deal with this

14:21.360 --> 14:22.292
in her own way...

14:22.361 --> 14:24.158
with as much dignity
as possible.

14:24.230 --> 14:25.561
Give her time.

14:25.631 --> 14:26.996
She may decide

14:27.066 --> 14:28.897
she wants company,
and if she does,

14:29.068 --> 14:31.002
you're the first person
l'll call.

14:47.086 --> 14:48.485
l have isolated a section

14:48.554 --> 14:51.489
that contains the bodies
of approximately 37 drones.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.718
37 doesn't sound
approximate to me.

14:53.792 --> 14:56.420
These drones were killed
in an explosion.

14:56.495 --> 14:58.622
There are only a few
left intact.

14:58.697 --> 15:01.461
Looks like there's still a
breathable atmosphere inside.

15:01.533 --> 15:04.058
Any sign of active Borg ships
in the vicinity?

15:04.169 --> 15:05.659
Nothing on sensors.

15:05.771 --> 15:07.500
Huh.
That could change in a hurry.

15:07.606 --> 15:08.868
Run continuous scans.

15:08.974 --> 15:10.271
Yes, ma'am.

15:41.507 --> 15:42.474
Tuvok, here.

15:42.574 --> 15:45.008
Help me get this off him.

15:58.390 --> 16:00.290
No apparent damage
to the cortical node.

16:47.172 --> 16:48.764
Captain, you've got company.

16:48.874 --> 16:51.843
There's a ship...

16:51.944 --> 16:55.038
Two to beam out.

16:55.114 --> 16:57.582
Delta Flyer, respond.

16:59.952 --> 17:02.921
Three humanoids have just
transported aboard this vessel.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.148
Drones?

17:05.190 --> 17:07.681
The only drones here are dead...

17:07.760 --> 17:09.489
and they belong to us.

17:12.498 --> 17:14.989
Who are you?

17:15.099 --> 17:17.329
Captain Kathryn Janeway
of the Starship Voyager.

17:17.435 --> 17:20.064
This is my debris field,
Captain.

17:20.172 --> 17:22.265
We weren't aware of that.

17:22.374 --> 17:24.535
What have you taken?

17:24.609 --> 17:25.872
A cortical node.

17:25.944 --> 17:27.673
We need it to save
one of my crew.

17:27.746 --> 17:30.874
Everything here belongs to us.

17:31.016 --> 17:33.883
Put down your weapons,
and l'll consider

17:33.952 --> 17:36.386
not activating
this laser scalpel.

17:59.011 --> 18:00.876
Sorry about the delay.

18:00.979 --> 18:04.005
They knocked
our transporters off-line.

18:15.861 --> 18:18.728
l need you at tactical!

18:18.797 --> 18:21.391
When l bring us around,
target their engine core.

18:21.467 --> 18:22.957
Aye, sir.

18:32.878 --> 18:35.005
Nice shot.

18:35.080 --> 18:38.481
They're breaking pursuit.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.400
May l ask what you're doing?

18:57.503 --> 18:59.232
Your filing system
is inefficient.

18:59.338 --> 19:00.703
l'm implementing a new one.

19:00.806 --> 19:02.740
You should be in bed.

19:02.774 --> 19:04.708
Delivery for Seven of Nine.

19:04.776 --> 19:07.370
Tarcanian wildflowers.

19:07.446 --> 19:09.073
Cheery, don't you think?

19:10.282 --> 19:12.011
Ah. Well,
if you prefer gladiolas,

19:12.084 --> 19:14.211
l could go back
to the Airponics Bay.

19:14.286 --> 19:16.049
That won't be necessary,
Mr. Neelix.

19:16.121 --> 19:19.386
The flowers are lovely,
aren't they, Seven?

19:19.458 --> 19:20.823
Thank you.

19:20.959 --> 19:23.223
l'll admire them later.

19:23.295 --> 19:26.059
Actually, l thought
l'd stay and keep you company.

19:26.131 --> 19:30.568
Uh, Seven prefers not to
have visitors right now.

19:30.636 --> 19:33.230
Not even a visitor
with a Kadis-Kot board?

19:33.338 --> 19:34.305
Correct.

19:34.373 --> 19:35.840
But it's your favorite game.

19:35.974 --> 19:37.874
Personally...

19:38.010 --> 19:40.444
l can't blame her.

19:40.512 --> 19:42.275
You're being
extremely insensitive.

19:42.347 --> 19:43.871
l am?

19:44.016 --> 19:47.042
You know perfectly very well
Seven is in a weakened state.

19:47.119 --> 19:49.451
She wouldn't stand
a chance against you.

19:49.521 --> 19:50.647
You're right.

19:50.722 --> 19:53.384
l-l don't know
what l was thinking.

19:53.458 --> 19:55.892
We'll play later
when you're feeling up to it.

19:55.994 --> 19:57.018
Green.

19:57.095 --> 19:59.359
l beg your pardon?

19:59.431 --> 20:01.126
l prefer the green pieces.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.861
You'll use red.

20:02.968 --> 20:05.402
Doctor, do you think
she's up to it?

20:05.470 --> 20:07.131
As long as you go easy on her.

20:07.239 --> 20:09.207
Janeway to the Doctor.

20:09.274 --> 20:10.536
Yes, Captain.

20:10.609 --> 20:13.169
We're back,
and we have the node.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.896
l'm ready to disengage
the damaged node.

20:38.003 --> 20:41.530
Transfer Seven's cortical
functions to the computer.

20:41.640 --> 20:43.107
Understood.

20:46.578 --> 20:48.170
Done.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.908
lnitiating the extraction.

21:04.696 --> 21:05.993
Vital functions are stable.

21:06.064 --> 21:07.531
-Time?
-20 seconds.

21:08.634 --> 21:10.067
Not yet.

21:10.135 --> 21:12.831
l have to realign
her primary neurodes first.

21:14.973 --> 21:17.669
The computer can't maintain her
cortical functions much longer.

21:18.744 --> 21:20.712
Ready.

21:29.655 --> 21:31.350
Her neural relays
are going to destabilize

21:31.423 --> 21:32.720
in ten seconds, nine...

21:32.791 --> 21:33.849
Almost finished.

21:33.925 --> 21:35.950
Eight, seven,

21:36.028 --> 21:38.496
six, five...

21:38.563 --> 21:41.327
Transfer Seven's cortical
functions to the new node.

21:45.237 --> 21:46.636
Something's wrong.

21:46.705 --> 21:48.332
She's going into
anaphylactic shock.

21:48.440 --> 21:49.634
Her implants aren't adapting.

21:49.708 --> 21:51.005
They're rejecting the new node.

21:53.011 --> 21:54.273
She's losing synaptic cohesion.

21:54.346 --> 21:56.439
Apply a 20 millijoule
neurostatic pulse on my mark.

21:58.216 --> 21:59.478
Now.

22:03.155 --> 22:03.883
No effect.

22:03.955 --> 22:06.116
Again.

22:08.093 --> 22:10.391
lncrease the pulse.
30 millijoules.

22:18.637 --> 22:22.266
Computer, end simulation.

22:24.176 --> 22:25.143
Why did you stop?

22:25.210 --> 22:26.575
lt wasn't working.

22:26.645 --> 22:27.634
Run it again.

22:27.713 --> 22:29.840
Captain, this was
our 12th simulation.

22:29.915 --> 22:32.145
Something tells me 13
won't be our lucky number.

22:32.217 --> 22:35.812
The salvaged node has
been inactive too long.

22:35.887 --> 22:37.855
Then we'll find one that hasn't.

22:39.825 --> 22:41.816
No matter how many debris
fields we sift through,

22:41.893 --> 22:44.259
a node from a dead drone
isn't going to work.

22:44.329 --> 22:45.956
Who said anything
about a dead drone?

22:46.064 --> 22:47.224
What's that supposed to mean?

22:47.299 --> 22:48.857
We've infiltrated
Borg vessels before.

22:48.934 --> 22:50.424
lf that's what it's going
to take to save Seven,

22:50.535 --> 22:51.593
we'll do it again.

22:51.703 --> 22:53.671
Are you suggesting ending
one life to save another?

22:53.772 --> 22:54.966
l'm not giving up on her.

22:55.073 --> 22:57.303
Neither am l!

22:57.376 --> 22:59.344
l'll do everything
in my power to help her,

22:59.411 --> 23:01.402
but we both have
to face the possibility

23:01.513 --> 23:03.811
that it may not be enough.

23:10.655 --> 23:13.146
Red. Grid 13-3.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.488
They should've finished
the simulation by now.

23:18.563 --> 23:21.054
l'm sure they'll let you know
as soon as they do.

23:21.133 --> 23:22.566
Your move.

23:22.634 --> 23:25.194
Don't you have more
important duties to attend to?

23:25.303 --> 23:28.101
Nothing that can't wait.

23:28.173 --> 23:29.470
Despite
what the Doctor told you,

23:29.541 --> 23:30.530
l feel perfectly fine.

23:30.642 --> 23:31.631
Really?

23:31.743 --> 23:33.973
Because it looks to me
like you're about to lose.

23:38.750 --> 23:40.240
Kadis-Kot.

23:40.318 --> 23:42.582
l should've seen that coming.

23:42.654 --> 23:44.884
Oh, well, that makes what, uh,

23:44.956 --> 23:46.890
16 to 3, your lead?

23:46.958 --> 23:47.947
16 to 2.

23:48.026 --> 23:50.051
Oh, my mistake.

23:53.498 --> 23:55.898
Oh, uh...
well, l should really see

23:55.967 --> 23:58.765
how things are going
in the Mess Hall...

23:58.870 --> 24:01.896
but l'll be back later
for a rematch.

24:02.007 --> 24:03.338
Are you ready to proceed?

24:06.344 --> 24:07.641
According to the simulations,

24:07.712 --> 24:09.407
the salvaged node
isn't going to work.

24:09.481 --> 24:10.880
l'm sorry.

24:10.982 --> 24:13.712
l'm still researching
alternative treatments,

24:13.785 --> 24:17.414
and Harry and B'Elanna are going
to try to repair the faulty node

24:17.489 --> 24:19.116
using components
from your alcove.

24:19.191 --> 24:20.681
They'll fail.

24:23.895 --> 24:25.624
We're not giving up hope.

24:25.697 --> 24:27.358
Neither should you.

24:31.036 --> 24:31.900
With your permission,

24:32.037 --> 24:33.698
l'd like to return to my duties.

24:33.805 --> 24:34.897
That's not possible.

24:35.040 --> 24:36.337
l need to monitor
your condition.

24:36.408 --> 24:37.340
Captain?

24:37.409 --> 24:41.470
l'm afraid l have
to defer to the Doctor.

24:41.546 --> 24:45.380
lf you'd like, l can ask lcheb
to bring some of your work here.

25:09.307 --> 25:10.672
Doctor?

25:12.844 --> 25:14.209
Computer, locate the Doctor.

25:14.279 --> 25:15.837
The EMH is off-line.

25:15.914 --> 25:17.506
Activate the EMH.

25:17.582 --> 25:19.379
...forced to sedate you!

25:19.451 --> 25:20.782
Doctor?

25:20.852 --> 25:21.876
l'm sorry, lcheb.

25:21.987 --> 25:23.477
l wasn't talking to you.

25:23.555 --> 25:24.579
Where's Seven?

25:24.656 --> 25:25.623
l wish l knew.

25:25.690 --> 25:26.884
When l refused to release her,

25:26.958 --> 25:29.324
she overrode my
autonomy protocols...

25:29.394 --> 25:31.658
in the middle of a sentence,
no less.

25:31.730 --> 25:34.130
Computer, locate Seven of Nine.

25:34.199 --> 25:36.531
Seven of Nine is in Sick Bay.

25:47.012 --> 25:49.071
He's looking for you...

25:49.147 --> 25:50.705
the Doctor.

25:51.816 --> 25:53.613
l ran into him in the corridor.

25:53.685 --> 25:57.883
He's about 30 seconds away
from calling a shipwide alert.

25:57.956 --> 26:00.447
Are you going to tell him
where l am?

26:00.525 --> 26:04.962
Nope. l know what it's like
to be stuck in Sick Bay.

26:05.030 --> 26:09.262
l've escaped the Doctor myself
once or twice.

26:09.367 --> 26:10.356
Thank you.

26:10.468 --> 26:11.526
Anytime.

26:13.805 --> 26:15.397
Lieutenant...

26:19.611 --> 26:21.772
when you die,

26:21.846 --> 26:25.373
do you believe your spirit
will go to Sto-Vo-Kor?.

26:25.450 --> 26:27.850
You shouldn't be thinking
about dying.

26:27.919 --> 26:29.682
According to the Doctor's
simulations,

26:29.754 --> 26:32.985
any attempt to adapt
the salvaged node will fail.

26:41.366 --> 26:44.460
Sto-Vo-Kor, Lieutenant...

26:44.569 --> 26:46.560
do you believe you'll go there?

26:46.671 --> 26:53.839
l guess it all depends
on how honorable my death is.

26:53.912 --> 26:57.348
But you do believe
there's something after death?

26:57.415 --> 26:59.940
l hope so.

27:06.057 --> 27:07.854
What about you?

27:10.095 --> 27:14.293
The Borg have no concept
of an afterlife.

27:14.366 --> 27:16.834
However, when a drone
is deactivated,

27:16.968 --> 27:19.163
its memories continue to reside

27:19.270 --> 27:21.636
in the collective's
consciousness.

27:21.706 --> 27:27.872
As long as the hive exists,
so will a part of that drone.

27:27.946 --> 27:31.438
You don't seem to take
much comfort in that.

27:32.517 --> 27:34.348
My link to the collective

27:34.419 --> 27:36.319
has been severed
for nearly four years.

27:38.390 --> 27:40.415
lf l die,

27:40.492 --> 27:42.585
everything that l've
accomplished in that time,

27:42.661 --> 27:45.528
everything l achieved
as an individual,

27:45.597 --> 27:47.531
will be lost.

27:47.599 --> 27:52.366
My memories, my experiences...

27:52.470 --> 27:56.099
it will be as if they...

27:56.207 --> 27:59.643
as if l never existed.

28:04.482 --> 28:07.645
l think you're
a little more memorable

28:07.719 --> 28:11.018
than you're giving
yourself credit for.

28:11.089 --> 28:15.185
You don't need the collective
to validate your existence.

28:15.260 --> 28:19.253
You've made an impact
on every member of this crew.

28:19.330 --> 28:21.230
That's your legacy.

28:22.801 --> 28:24.098
There you are.

28:25.937 --> 28:27.564
l should have known
she'd be the one

28:27.672 --> 28:28.639
to harbor a fugitive.

28:28.740 --> 28:32.608
We difficult patients
need to stick together.

28:32.677 --> 28:35.771
l want you to return
to Sick Bay immediately.

28:35.847 --> 28:37.872
Have you devised
a new treatment?

28:37.982 --> 28:39.472
Not yet.

28:39.551 --> 28:41.485
Then it's best
that l don't distract you

28:41.553 --> 28:42.577
from finding one.

28:42.654 --> 28:44.781
Seven, if you continue
to exert yourself,

28:44.856 --> 28:47.586
your condition will
only deteriorate more rapidly.

28:47.659 --> 28:49.627
ls that what you want?

28:49.694 --> 28:52.288
What l want is to be useful.

28:54.032 --> 28:55.363
l really could use her help.

28:55.433 --> 28:59.164
l promise
not to let her overdo it.

29:01.606 --> 29:05.736
You can stay, provided
you wear this cortical monitor.

29:12.484 --> 29:14.577
Thank you.

29:36.141 --> 29:39.042
Are you feeling better?

29:39.110 --> 29:41.476
My condition is unchanged.

29:45.216 --> 29:46.808
l've spoken to the Captain

29:46.885 --> 29:49.877
about your desire
to apply to Starfleet Academy.

29:50.021 --> 29:52.854
She's agreed to administer
the entrance exam

29:52.924 --> 29:57.361
before we send
the next datastream to Earth.

29:57.428 --> 30:00.886
lt's a list of crewmen
who can help you study.

30:01.032 --> 30:02.795
Lieutenant Torres is
extremely well-versed

30:02.901 --> 30:04.198
in warp mechanics.

30:04.302 --> 30:08.602
Ensign Kim claims to have aced
the quantum theory section.

30:08.673 --> 30:10.607
What about astrometrics?

30:10.675 --> 30:16.238
You know more about astrometrics
than most Starfleet officers.

30:16.314 --> 30:18.509
Still, l'll need someone
to review the material with me.

30:18.583 --> 30:21.279
l'll ask Lieutenant Paris
to set aside some time.

30:21.352 --> 30:22.717
l'd rather study with you.

30:26.858 --> 30:29.156
You've become
too dependent on me.

30:29.227 --> 30:31.127
You must learn
to rely on others.

30:31.196 --> 30:32.595
And if l don't want to?

30:32.664 --> 30:34.256
What you want is irrelevant.

30:34.332 --> 30:36.163
Why are you acting like this?

30:36.267 --> 30:38.235
ls it because
you think you're dying?

30:38.336 --> 30:39.394
l am dying.

30:42.674 --> 30:45.165
l'm sorry.

30:45.276 --> 30:49.144
You may have given up,
but l haven't.

31:26.451 --> 31:28.248
l know how to save her.

31:28.319 --> 31:30.253
l'm certainly open
to suggestions.

31:30.321 --> 31:33.222
l've been analyzing
the simulations you performed.

31:33.291 --> 31:35.759
They failed because
you tried to implement

31:35.827 --> 31:37.795
a cortical node
from a dead drone.

31:37.862 --> 31:38.954
That's correct.

31:39.030 --> 31:40.691
What you require
is a live drone.

31:40.765 --> 31:43.427
l've already been through that
with Captain Janeway.

31:43.534 --> 31:45.161
My cortical node is operational.

31:45.270 --> 31:48.137
l want you to remove it
and give it to Seven.

31:48.206 --> 31:49.173
Absolutely not!

31:49.240 --> 31:51.003
Well, at least
review my research.

31:51.109 --> 31:52.838
lt may as well be
a suicide note.

31:52.911 --> 31:53.843
l don't agree.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.004
Well, that's comforting.

31:55.146 --> 31:57.876
You took these scans of me
when l left the collective.

31:57.949 --> 31:59.143
By your own estimation,

31:59.217 --> 32:01.151
l emerged
from my maturation chamber

32:01.252 --> 32:02.913
before l was fully assimilated.

32:03.021 --> 32:04.454
As a result, my physiology

32:04.522 --> 32:06.422
is less dependent
on my implants.

32:06.491 --> 32:08.891
They still regulate
many of your vital functions.

32:08.960 --> 32:09.892
What about my age?

32:09.961 --> 32:11.588
l'm younger, so it
should be easier

32:11.663 --> 32:13.654
for my body
to adapt to the loss.

32:13.731 --> 32:14.663
You're obviously too young

32:14.732 --> 32:15.994
to understand
the risks involved.

32:16.067 --> 32:17.864
l understand the risks
perfectly.

32:17.969 --> 32:20.529
lf we continue to do
nothing, Seven will die.

32:20.638 --> 32:21.605
And if we proceed
with your idea,

32:21.706 --> 32:22.638
you could both die!

32:22.707 --> 32:24.106
According to my research,

32:24.175 --> 32:25.836
there's an 86.9 percent chance

32:25.910 --> 32:28.401
that Seven's implants
will adapt to my node.

32:28.479 --> 32:30.106
''Eighty-six...''

32:30.181 --> 32:31.546
Point nine.

32:32.850 --> 32:33.942
And what about you?

32:34.085 --> 32:35.518
Without a cortical node,

32:35.586 --> 32:37.816
how will you regulate
your implants?

32:37.889 --> 32:41.347
You should be able to compensate
with genetic resequencing.

32:41.426 --> 32:43.587
This isn't suicide, Doctor.

32:43.661 --> 32:45.959
l believe it can work.

32:46.097 --> 32:48.565
All l ask is that you
consider it.

32:56.941 --> 32:59.273
Earth's biggest ditch.

32:59.344 --> 33:01.972
That's what my father
used to call it.

33:02.080 --> 33:05.072
We hiked the north rim
when l was nine.

33:05.116 --> 33:07.141
lt's an impressive
geological formation.

33:07.218 --> 33:10.654
Too dusty. l've always preferred
farm country myself.

33:13.591 --> 33:16.287
Bloomington, lndiana,
your hometown.

33:16.361 --> 33:19.819
You've mentioned it
on several occasions.

33:19.897 --> 33:21.728
So, what do you think?

33:21.799 --> 33:25.326
lt appears to be
a pleasant environment.

33:25.436 --> 33:28.030
When we get to Earth,
l'll take you there.

33:28.139 --> 33:29.071
lt's more likely

33:29.140 --> 33:31.301
this crew will reach Earth
without me.

33:31.376 --> 33:33.674
You don't know that.

33:33.745 --> 33:37.943
You refuse to acknowledge
the severity of my condition,

33:38.049 --> 33:39.846
just as l did at first.

33:39.917 --> 33:42.852
Are you giving up?

33:42.920 --> 33:45.514
l'm merely accepting reality.

33:46.591 --> 33:49.890
lf l'd accepted reality
six years ago,

33:49.961 --> 33:52.054
l'd have settled
on the first M-Class planet

33:52.130 --> 33:53.062
we came across.

33:53.131 --> 33:55.463
lnstead, l'm 30,000
light-years closer

33:55.533 --> 33:56.966
to Bloomington, lndiana.

33:57.101 --> 33:59.296
Minus several members
of your crew.

34:00.972 --> 34:04.169
Ensign Marie Kaplan,

34:04.242 --> 34:07.040
Ensign Lyndsay Ballard,
Crewman Timothy Lang...

34:07.111 --> 34:08.601
ls there a point to this?

34:08.679 --> 34:12.170
Every person on this list
died under your command.

34:12.250 --> 34:15.083
You accepted their deaths,

34:15.152 --> 34:18.350
but l don't believe
you'll accept mine.

34:18.422 --> 34:20.118
That's presumptuous.

34:20.190 --> 34:21.886
l'm not being egotistical.

34:21.958 --> 34:24.826
On the contrary,
l'm trying to make a point.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.362
Which is?

34:28.666 --> 34:32.534
All of these crew members
came to Voyager

34:32.637 --> 34:35.105
with unique personalities,

34:35.206 --> 34:37.800
but l have required
your constant assistance

34:37.909 --> 34:39.706
to develop my individuality.

34:39.777 --> 34:41.438
And you've come a long way.

34:41.512 --> 34:42.672
But not far enough.

34:42.746 --> 34:45.841
l've disappointed you.

34:45.917 --> 34:48.750
You feel your task
is incomplete.

34:48.820 --> 34:51.880
That's why my death will be
difficult for you to accept.

34:51.956 --> 34:54.288
ls that what you think?

34:54.358 --> 34:58.920
That you haven't lived up
to my expectations?

34:58.996 --> 35:00.896
Clearly, l haven't,

35:00.998 --> 35:03.466
but l want you to know

35:03.568 --> 35:08.198
that the failure
has been mine, not yours.

35:09.307 --> 35:13.073
You haven't failed, Seven.

35:13.144 --> 35:16.136
You've exceeded my expectations.

35:16.214 --> 35:17.875
You've become an individual,

35:17.982 --> 35:19.882
an extraordinary individual.

35:20.017 --> 35:23.248
lf l'm having trouble
accepting your condition,

35:23.321 --> 35:27.621
it's only because l don't
want to lose a friend.

35:29.827 --> 35:31.454
Doctor to the Captain.
l need to see you

35:31.529 --> 35:33.827
and Seven right away.

35:36.167 --> 35:38.465
lt would be
a complicated procedure.

35:38.569 --> 35:39.501
No doubt.

35:39.570 --> 35:41.128
But you believe it'll work.

35:41.239 --> 35:43.639
There are significant
risks involved...

35:43.708 --> 35:44.800
to Seven and lcheb,

35:44.909 --> 35:46.900
but if you're asking
me if it's possible,

35:47.011 --> 35:48.035
l'd have to say yes.

35:48.112 --> 35:49.204
What sort of precautions...?

35:49.280 --> 35:50.770
No matter how many
precautions you take,

35:50.848 --> 35:52.145
it's not worth
the risk to lcheb.

35:52.216 --> 35:53.274
Seven, this could work.

35:53.351 --> 35:54.682
l'm not willing
to extend my life

35:54.752 --> 35:55.946
at the cost of yours.

35:56.087 --> 35:57.952
But you haven't
reviewed all the data.

35:58.022 --> 35:59.751
As long as there is any chance

35:59.824 --> 36:02.224
you won't survive,
the data is irrelevant.

36:02.326 --> 36:04.385
l'd like to return
to Sick Bay now.

36:04.428 --> 36:06.157
As you wish.

36:10.401 --> 36:11.459
You're the Captain.

36:11.569 --> 36:13.196
You could order her to do it.

36:13.304 --> 36:15.204
l have to respect her wishes.

36:15.273 --> 36:16.672
Even if it kills her?

36:16.741 --> 36:19.574
l want to help her
just as much as you do.

36:19.644 --> 36:23.307
lf that were true,
you wouldn't let her die.

36:33.858 --> 36:36.884
ls there anything l can bring
from the Cargo Bay

36:37.028 --> 36:38.893
to make you feel more at home?

36:39.030 --> 36:40.088
No, thank you.

36:40.164 --> 36:42.496
Something from the Mess Hall?

36:42.567 --> 36:43.898
A piece of fruit?

36:44.001 --> 36:46.731
Are you offering me
my last meal?

36:46.837 --> 36:48.828
l... o-of course not.

36:48.940 --> 36:50.635
ls that what you thought?

36:50.708 --> 36:53.472
l was attempting
to lighten the mood.

36:53.544 --> 36:56.069
Ah, yes.
Well done.

36:56.147 --> 36:57.580
lcheb to the Doctor.

36:57.648 --> 37:00.208
Report to Cargo Bay 2
immediately.

37:00.284 --> 37:01.546
He's persistent.

37:01.619 --> 37:03.211
Not to worry.

37:03.287 --> 37:07.053
l'll make it clear to him
that persistence is futile.

37:14.332 --> 37:16.926
You were summoned, too?

37:17.034 --> 37:19.127
lcheb doesn't seem
to have grasped

37:19.237 --> 37:20.761
the chain of command yet.

37:20.871 --> 37:23.704
Remind you of anyone we know?

37:23.774 --> 37:25.105
lcheb!

37:30.681 --> 37:32.876
He's disengaged
his cortical node!

37:32.984 --> 37:33.973
How?

37:34.051 --> 37:35.075
My alcove...

37:35.152 --> 37:37.643
l programmed it
to disconnect my neural relays.

37:37.722 --> 37:38.814
Can you reconnect them?

37:38.889 --> 37:40.686
He's locked me out
of the controls.

37:40.758 --> 37:41.850
How could you do this?

37:41.926 --> 37:44.053
lt was the only way
l could prove to you

37:44.128 --> 37:45.186
that it would work.

37:58.809 --> 37:59.935
What's wrong with him?

38:00.011 --> 38:02.206
lcheb decided to perform
a little operation

38:02.246 --> 38:03.372
on himself.

38:03.414 --> 38:05.746
You have to reconnect
his node immediately.

38:05.816 --> 38:07.078
l intend to.

38:07.151 --> 38:09.745
No. lf Seven can refuse
treatment, so can l.

38:09.820 --> 38:10.980
We don't have time for this.

38:11.055 --> 38:12.283
Well, then, check your scans.

38:12.356 --> 38:13.687
You'll see l'm already adapting.

38:13.758 --> 38:15.817
Some of your implants
have adapted, but not all.

38:15.926 --> 38:17.826
Then apply the resequencing
technique l researched.

38:17.962 --> 38:19.395
This debate is pointless.

38:19.463 --> 38:20.828
l won't accept the node.

38:20.931 --> 38:22.455
And l won't keep it.

38:22.533 --> 38:24.057
Someone had better
use the damn thing.

38:24.168 --> 38:25.635
lf it stays
disconnected much longer,

38:25.736 --> 38:27.169
it won't do either
of you any good.

38:27.238 --> 38:29.172
You're acting like a child.

38:29.240 --> 38:30.673
l'm trying to save your life.

38:30.741 --> 38:32.709
Only because you've grown
too dependent on me.

38:32.777 --> 38:34.972
So you think l need to learn
to rely on other people?

38:35.046 --> 38:36.070
-Yes.
-What about you?

38:36.147 --> 38:39.514
You've refused to rely
on a single member of this crew.

38:39.583 --> 38:41.608
You hid your condition
from the rest of us.

38:41.686 --> 38:42.880
You deactivated the Doctor,

38:42.987 --> 38:45.387
and now
you're rejecting my help.

38:45.456 --> 38:47.856
You're the one who needs
to rely on others.

38:47.925 --> 38:50.018
lsn't that what people
on this ship do?

38:50.094 --> 38:51.220
They help each other?

38:51.295 --> 38:52.353
Whenever we can.

38:52.430 --> 38:55.228
lf the Captain were dying,

38:55.299 --> 38:57.563
you'd risk your life to
save her, wouldn't you?

38:57.668 --> 38:59.067
And when you respond
to a distress call,

38:59.136 --> 39:01.036
you're risking the life
of everyone on this ship

39:01.138 --> 39:04.198
to respond to the aid
of strangers.

39:04.308 --> 39:05.866
He's right.

39:05.976 --> 39:08.570
Captain, he's just a child.

39:08.646 --> 39:11.012
l don't think he is...

39:11.082 --> 39:13.016
not anymore.

39:13.084 --> 39:14.711
Doctor.

39:14.785 --> 39:17.413
Don't look at me.

39:17.488 --> 39:19.683
Please.

39:19.757 --> 39:21.622
Just let us help you.

39:37.942 --> 39:39.967
Let's begin.

41:11.569 --> 41:13.730
Good morning.

41:13.838 --> 41:16.136
How long have l
been regenerating?

41:16.207 --> 41:17.299
Six days.

41:17.408 --> 41:19.308
We needed to make sure
your implants

41:19.376 --> 41:21.469
had completely adapted
to the new node.

41:21.545 --> 41:23.638
The good news is they have.

41:26.550 --> 41:27.642
lcheb.

41:30.888 --> 41:31.946
His road to recovery

41:32.089 --> 41:34.489
has been a little bumpier
than yours.

41:34.558 --> 41:37.493
Has he suffered
any permanent damage?

41:37.561 --> 41:38.823
l don't think so.

41:38.896 --> 41:41.228
He's been experiencing
some pain,

41:41.298 --> 41:43.391
but l believe it's temporary.

41:43.467 --> 41:44.832
Pain l caused him.

41:44.935 --> 41:47.495
Pain he was willing to endure.

42:04.488 --> 42:05.750
You've recovered.

42:05.823 --> 42:08.383
l expect the same from you.

42:08.459 --> 42:12.589
The Doctor wants
to keep me here another week,

42:12.663 --> 42:17.760
but l'm sure l'll be back
on my feet in half that time.

42:17.868 --> 42:21.031
l suggest you get
as much rest as you can.

42:21.138 --> 42:22.935
You're going to need it.

42:23.073 --> 42:24.938
Why?

42:25.075 --> 42:27.339
l've decided
to help you prepare

42:27.411 --> 42:30.938
for the astrometrics portion
of the Academy exam.

42:31.048 --> 42:34.506
You can expect a rigorous
and grueling schedule.

42:38.556 --> 42:40.148
Seven...

42:40.224 --> 42:41.486
Yes.

42:41.559 --> 42:43.652
Your ocular implant--

42:43.727 --> 42:46.025
it's malfunctioning again.

42:51.201 --> 42:52.429
Actually...

42:52.536 --> 42:54.663
it's functioning perfectly.
