<i>It was 1947,</i>

01:54.406 --> 01:56.949
<i>two years after the war,
when I began my journey</i>

01:57.034 --> 02:00.203
<i>to what my father called
the "Sodom of the north,"</i>

02:00.287 --> 02:01.537
<i>New York.</i>

02:02.581 --> 02:03.956
<i>Call me Stingo,</i>

02:04.041 --> 02:06.793
<i>which was the nickname
I was known by in those days,</i>

02:06.877 --> 02:09.211
<i>if I was called anything at all.</i>

02:10.255 --> 02:13.424
<i>I had barely saved enough money
to write my novel,</i>

02:14.259 --> 02:18.554
<i>for I wanted beyond hope or dreaming
to be a writer.</i>

02:19.014 --> 02:21.641
<i>But my spirit had remained landlocked,</i>

02:22.142 --> 02:25.478
<i>unacquainted with love
and a stranger to death.</i>

02:28.482 --> 02:29.482
<i>Even back then,</i>

02:29.566 --> 02:32.693
<i>cheap apartments were hard to find
in Manhattan.</i>

02:34.696 --> 02:37.448
<i>And so began my voyage of discovery</i>

02:38.450 --> 02:40.910
<i>in a place as strange as Brooklyn.</i>

03:04.935 --> 03:06.143
I know.

03:06.603 --> 03:10.064
You're thinking about the pink.
Everybody does.

03:10.941 --> 03:14.318
See, my late husband Saul,
he got his bargain.

03:14.778 --> 03:19.574
Hundreds and hundreds of gallons
of this navy surplus paint.

03:20.033 --> 03:23.911
See, I guess they didn't have any use for pink
on those boats, huh?

03:26.665 --> 03:28.457
Okay, I'll take it.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.493
Oh, I love you!

05:15.107 --> 05:17.024
Don't go! Don't go!

05:17.150 --> 05:19.068
- I'm out of here. Don't!
- No!

05:27.828 --> 05:29.578
We need each other.

05:35.669 --> 05:38.004
I told you to leave me alone.

05:38.088 --> 05:40.339
Stay away from me.
Get out of my way.

05:40.424 --> 05:41.924
No, no, don't!

05:42.843 --> 05:45.177
- I'm not lying, you know!
- You're lying.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.887
- I'm not!
- You're lying.

05:47.222 --> 05:50.391
Please, don't go!
Don't go away from me, please!

05:50.600 --> 05:52.518
You know we need each other, Nathan,
you know this.

05:52.602 --> 05:53.644
We need each other.

05:53.729 --> 05:54.687
- Me need you?
- Yes...

05:54.771 --> 05:56.439
Let me tell you something.

05:56.523 --> 06:00.609
I need you like any goddamned
insufferable disease I can name!

06:00.694 --> 06:03.612
I need you like a case of anthrax,
hear me?

06:03.905 --> 06:05.489
Like trichinosis.

06:05.574 --> 06:10.536
I need you like a biliary calculus,
pellagra, encephalitis.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.538
Bright's disease, for Christ's sake!

06:12.622 --> 06:14.498
Carcinoma of the brain!

06:14.875 --> 06:17.251
I need you like death.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.336
Hear me? Like death.

06:19.421 --> 06:20.796
No, Nathan.

06:21.757 --> 06:23.758
Go back to Krakow, baby.

06:24.301 --> 06:25.968
Back to Krakow!

06:31.957 --> 06:33.642
Well, good evening.

06:34.269 --> 06:35.895
Did you have a good time?

06:35.979 --> 06:37.563
I mean, did you enjoy our little show?

06:37.647 --> 06:40.608
Do you get off
on your little bit of eavesdropping?

06:40.692 --> 06:43.027
You just... My door was open.
I just wondered what was going on.

06:43.820 --> 06:46.614
Your door was open?
You wondered what was going on?

06:46.698 --> 06:51.327
Well, shut my mouth if it isn't
our new literate figure from the South.

06:52.120 --> 06:55.539
Too bad I won't be around
for a little lively conversation.

06:55.749 --> 06:59.168
We would've had a great time,
you and I, shooting the shit.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.587
We could've talked about sports.

07:02.172 --> 07:03.756
Southern sports like

07:03.840 --> 07:07.676
lynching niggers, or "coons,"
I think you all call them down there.

07:09.513 --> 07:12.389
So long, cracker.
See you in another life.

07:16.228 --> 07:17.520
You okay?

07:18.438 --> 07:19.522
Yes.

07:21.066 --> 07:22.191
Yeah.

07:30.291 --> 07:31.534
I'm very sorry.

07:36.665 --> 07:38.374
That's not the way

07:40.043 --> 07:41.919
he really is, you know?

07:43.046 --> 07:45.339
No, don't apologize, all right?

07:45.966 --> 07:48.467
I live downstairs here.
If there's anything you want...

07:48.552 --> 07:49.927
Thank you.

07:53.390 --> 07:55.057
You're very kind.

07:55.433 --> 07:56.976
Anyway, I'm downstairs here.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.519
No, I'm all right.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.235
I'm Stingo.

08:11.199 --> 08:13.450
Please forgive us.

08:18.623 --> 08:22.334
Sixty cents. Anytime he raises 50 cents.

08:22.719 --> 08:23.711
Sixty...

08:27.257 --> 08:28.382
Yeah?

08:47.927 --> 08:50.279
We had invited you to dinner.

08:51.114 --> 08:53.282
That's very thoughtful of you.

08:53.450 --> 08:57.912
Uh, listen, I very often work at night
and type at night.

08:58.663 --> 09:00.998
But if it's going to bother you,
I don't want to...

09:01.082 --> 09:02.082
Oh, no!

09:02.167 --> 09:03.250
When I was a little girl,

09:03.335 --> 09:08.255
my father type and I go to sleep
to that sound.

09:09.799 --> 09:11.592
It'll make me feel...

09:13.303 --> 09:14.929
God, how do you say that?

09:15.013 --> 09:16.972
Secure. Secure.

09:18.642 --> 09:20.059
Your father was a writer?

09:20.143 --> 09:21.852
No, my father was...

09:21.937 --> 09:24.104
My father was professor of law.

09:24.189 --> 09:25.814
He wrote articles

09:26.149 --> 09:29.652
warning Polish people of the Nazi threat

09:30.612 --> 09:34.615
and trying to get help for those Jews
that was persecuted, so.

09:35.700 --> 09:39.370
Yeah, that sound of typing
will make me think of my father

09:40.705 --> 09:42.498
and of his goodness.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.000
You wouldn't want to come in,
would you?

09:45.835 --> 09:47.544
Maybe some other time.

09:47.629 --> 09:49.588
So, if you'll forgive me.

09:51.007 --> 09:52.675
- Good night.
- Yeah.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.094
Stinko, yeah?

09:55.971 --> 09:57.388
Stingo.

09:57.472 --> 09:58.848
Stingo, yes!

09:59.849 --> 10:01.809
I never hear that name.

10:02.644 --> 10:03.811
There's no "K" in there, though.

10:03.895 --> 10:04.895
I got it.

10:04.980 --> 10:06.522
Just a "G."

10:07.148 --> 10:08.274
Yeah, it's nice!

10:09.442 --> 10:13.153
It's a friendly, you know, happy sound.

10:13.446 --> 10:14.530
I like it.

12:09.011 --> 12:10.437
Oh, Nathan!

12:13.566 --> 12:14.775
Oh, Nathan.

12:21.324 --> 12:22.825
Oh, God!

12:31.835 --> 12:35.212
Don't you see, Sophie?
We are dying.

12:41.553 --> 12:45.264
Rise and shine, honey child.
Stir them lazy bones.

12:45.849 --> 12:48.308
The grits on the griddle,
the corn's on the pone.

12:48.643 --> 12:50.978
Old Ponkers plan to hitch up
the coach and four.

12:51.354 --> 12:55.023
You're going to have a picnic out
and down by the seashore.

12:55.525 --> 12:56.984
Good morning, Stingo.

12:57.068 --> 12:58.068
Good morning.

12:59.112 --> 13:02.406
We wanted to make friends

13:02.490 --> 13:05.200
and to take you out
on this beautiful summer day!

13:05.285 --> 13:07.828
We want you to come up
and have breakfast with us.

13:07.912 --> 13:09.204
- And then...
- Yes.

13:09.330 --> 13:10.456
Coney Island.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.124
Coney Island! Oh, boy!

13:14.002 --> 13:15.919
Sorry about last night.

13:16.546 --> 13:17.713
Yeah.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.955
I know what you're thinking.
"These people are strange."

13:52.040 --> 13:55.959
On Sundays, we like to dress up
a little differently and go out.

13:58.588 --> 14:00.088
- Okay.
- Okay?

14:00.298 --> 14:01.673
I knew you'd understand!

14:01.925 --> 14:05.093
You see, everybody out there
dresses the same.

14:05.428 --> 14:07.137
Look at those poor,
pathetic people out there.

14:07.222 --> 14:08.722
Look at them. Drones.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.600
All walking down the street,
all look alike,

14:11.684 --> 14:14.436
all wearing the same drab, boring uniform.

14:14.771 --> 14:16.230
You're boring!

14:16.564 --> 14:17.564
Morning!

14:19.275 --> 14:22.027
Now, this one. Look at this.
God's gift!

14:22.570 --> 14:24.112
Give me a kiss.

14:24.572 --> 14:25.614
One kiss. Please.

14:25.698 --> 14:28.867
All right, one kiss.
That's all you deserve.

14:28.952 --> 14:30.035
One more. I need one more.

14:30.119 --> 14:31.078
No.

14:31.162 --> 14:33.038
- I have to have one more.
- Nathan...

14:33.122 --> 14:35.290
Can't keep my hands off of you.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.793
This is... No, Nathan Landau!

14:38.127 --> 14:39.262
What do you think of that, Stingo?

14:40.046 --> 14:42.631
Here I am, a nice Jewish boy,

14:43.758 --> 14:45.300
pushing 30.

14:45.468 --> 14:47.803
I fall crazy in love with a Polish shiksa.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.888
What is that? What is a "shiksa"?

14:49.973 --> 14:54.309
A shiksa is a goy girl.
A lady of the Gentile persuasion.

14:56.104 --> 14:57.279
She's a...

14:57.814 --> 15:01.316
All right. I just assumed that she was...

15:02.110 --> 15:03.902
- She was Jewish?
- Yeah.

15:03.987 --> 15:05.153
Jewish?

15:05.321 --> 15:08.824
No, no, no.
No, our Sophie is Catholic.

15:10.702 --> 15:14.288
Yeah. Well, it's okay,
but I'm not anymore Catholic, so.

15:14.831 --> 15:16.373
Well, Catholic-ish.

15:17.834 --> 15:20.168
When I first met this one here,

15:20.503 --> 15:23.255
she was a rag and a bone
and a hank of hair.

15:23.715 --> 15:25.340
And that was a whole year-and-a-half

15:25.425 --> 15:28.260
after the Russians had liberated
the camp she was in.

15:28.344 --> 15:32.514
Yeah, it looked like something
that scares the birds.

15:32.724 --> 15:35.851
What is that? Scarecrow.

15:37.253 --> 15:38.645
I had "scurbut."

15:38.730 --> 15:41.398
No, no, no! She means scurvy.

15:41.691 --> 15:44.401
And typhus and anemia and scarlet fever.

15:44.485 --> 15:47.112
It was a fucking miracle
that she emerged from that camp alive.

15:47.196 --> 15:48.280
Right.

15:48.364 --> 15:52.034
I mean, I thought that I had leukemia.

15:54.579 --> 15:56.455
I thought I was dying.

15:57.206 --> 16:00.834
But it was Nathan that see
that it was only anemia.

16:01.544 --> 16:02.502
Are you a doctor?

16:02.587 --> 16:03.587
No, no.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.631
That's my brother's domain.

16:05.715 --> 16:06.673
But I'm a biologist.

16:06.758 --> 16:07.758
Yeah!

16:08.301 --> 16:10.385
- I graduated in science from Harvard.
- Harvard.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.521
And he...

16:12.805 --> 16:17.267
MA in Developmental and Cellular Biology.

16:18.561 --> 16:19.645
I do research now.

16:19.729 --> 16:20.687
He works at Pfizer.

16:20.772 --> 16:23.815
Pfizer, it's a big pharmaceutical house
here in Brooklyn.

16:23.900 --> 16:27.069
Anyway, I took her to this friend
of my brother's,

16:27.153 --> 16:29.488
a doctor who teaches up
at Columbia Presbyterian.

16:29.614 --> 16:30.697
Yeah.

16:30.782 --> 16:32.866
He confirmed my diagnosis.

16:33.076 --> 16:35.327
And we put the little sweetie here

16:35.411 --> 16:37.913
on massive doses of ferrous sulfate

16:38.915 --> 16:41.416
and she began to bloom like a rose.

16:42.794 --> 16:44.010
A rose.

16:44.962 --> 16:46.213
A rose.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.050
A beautiful fucking rose.

16:53.429 --> 16:55.097
You're something.

16:55.598 --> 16:58.725
Thank you for making me
to bloom like a rose.

17:08.611 --> 17:11.029
Not "to bloom," just "bloom."

17:11.280 --> 17:12.698
She's so good.
It's about time she was perfect.

17:12.781 --> 17:16.117
"To bloom." So what?
I mean, this is a ridiculous language!

17:16.202 --> 17:17.911
There's too many words!

17:17.994 --> 17:22.207
The word for "velocity," okay,
there's "fast, quick, rapid,"

17:22.290 --> 17:24.126
and they all mean the same thing.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.377
Swift, speedy.

17:25.461 --> 17:26.586
Hasty.

17:26.963 --> 17:28.422
- Fleet.
- Brisk.

17:28.756 --> 17:30.716
- Expeditious.
- Accelerated.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.092
Winged.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.803
No, no! Stop it!

17:35.722 --> 17:37.305
It's ridiculous!

17:37.890 --> 17:41.560
In French, it's so easy.
You say <i>vite.</i>

17:41.644 --> 17:44.855
Or in Polish, <i>szybko,</i>
and in Russian, <i>bystro.</i>

17:44.939 --> 17:48.525
It's only in the English it's so complicated!

17:48.609 --> 17:50.026
How many languages do you know?

17:50.111 --> 17:52.738
Well, my father was a linguist,
so I mean, I...

17:52.822 --> 17:56.491
He teach me German, French, Russian, Hungarian,

17:56.576 --> 17:58.410
the Slavic languages.

17:59.162 --> 18:02.664
So, what language I am butchering now?

18:03.583 --> 18:04.750
English!

18:04.959 --> 18:07.961
I bet your father was
a very interesting man.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.301
Yeah, my father was

18:16.345 --> 18:17.971
a civilized man.

18:22.435 --> 18:25.187
That's the word, yeah? "Civilized"?

18:25.563 --> 18:27.439
- Very good word.
- Yeah?

18:27.523 --> 18:31.276
My father was a civilized man
living in a non-civilized time.

18:31.861 --> 18:34.780
The civilized, they was the first to die.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.117
Do you play the piano?

18:39.410 --> 18:42.037
No. I used to play, but I...

18:45.750 --> 18:47.501
I no longer play.

18:49.879 --> 18:51.546
I don't anymore.

18:52.715 --> 18:55.175
My mother was a beautiful pianist.

19:00.890 --> 19:05.060
Nathan surprised me
with that piano on my birthday!

19:31.462 --> 19:33.171
I love that piece.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.272
When I was a little girl,

19:51.566 --> 19:53.650
I remember, I'd lay in bed

19:53.734 --> 19:57.404
and I'd hear my mother downstairs
playing the piano,

19:59.615 --> 20:02.367
and the sound of my father's typewriter.

20:05.204 --> 20:10.500
I think no child has a more
wonderful father and mother.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.550
And a more beautiful life.

20:36.152 --> 20:37.819
<i>Swanee,</i> you know that song, right?

20:53.878 --> 20:55.170
Stingo, hit it!

21:59.902 --> 22:02.404
Oh, God!

22:02.571 --> 22:05.073
<i>Suddenly, I shivered violently.</i>

22:06.492 --> 22:09.619
<i>I remembered Nathan's voice
that night before.</i>

22:11.247 --> 22:14.833
<i>"Don't you see, Sophie?
We are dying."</i>

22:16.043 --> 22:18.545
<i>I longed desperately to escape,</i>

22:19.255 --> 22:21.423
<i>to pack my bags and flee.</i>

22:22.216 --> 22:23.758
<i>But I did not.</i>

22:25.469 --> 22:27.679
<i>I stayed at Yetta Zimmerman's,</i>

22:27.763 --> 22:32.392
<i>and thus I helped fulfill Sophie's prophecy
about the three of us.</i>

22:32.476 --> 22:34.978
<i>We became the best of friends.</i>

24:11.200 --> 24:16.246
Here is an example of how emotionally
evocative English can be.

24:16.330 --> 24:19.624
<i>Sophie loved to tell
how Nathan saved her life.</i>

24:20.501 --> 24:24.129
<i>Their meeting was, for her, a miracle.</i>

24:24.213 --> 24:26.965
"Because I could not stop for Death,

24:27.216 --> 24:30.135
"he kindly stopped for me.

24:30.219 --> 24:34.013
"The carriage held but just ourselves
and Immortality."

24:35.391 --> 24:37.267
Rhymes, rhymes.

24:37.351 --> 24:39.102
It's not hard enough
to understand the language.

24:40.271 --> 24:43.356
Just everyday life talk.
He has to read us rhymes!

24:43.440 --> 24:47.694
...what the beauty of the language can be
when written by artists.

24:48.737 --> 24:51.865
I look forward to seeing you all next week.
And now remember,

24:53.033 --> 24:55.160
you must not get discouraged.

24:55.744 --> 24:57.203
You'll see.

24:57.288 --> 25:00.623
One morning, you'll wake up
and find you've been dreaming in English.

25:02.084 --> 25:04.878
Excuse me.
Who did he say wrote that poem?

25:04.962 --> 25:06.671
Dickens.

25:06.755 --> 25:08.423
Emily Dickens.

25:08.507 --> 25:09.966
Thank you.

25:14.805 --> 25:19.267
All I want is that we should be able
to make living...

25:22.771 --> 25:25.648
Are you all right, Miss Zawistowska?

25:32.281 --> 25:33.615
Yes.

25:35.659 --> 25:38.286
Thank you, I'm very fine.

25:38.370 --> 25:39.787
I'm a little tired.

25:39.872 --> 25:44.792
I noticed that you've been looking, well,
a little delicate lately.

25:46.378 --> 25:47.754
I hope I'm not being too personal.

25:47.838 --> 25:49.589
No! No, I...

25:51.217 --> 25:53.676
Could you help me with that?

26:01.518 --> 26:02.977
Thank you.

26:04.730 --> 26:06.564
Thank you for your

26:08.275 --> 26:09.442
concern.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.369
Goodbye.

26:43.960 --> 26:46.938
Excuse me, sir. Could you tell me what...

26:49.483 --> 26:53.361
Where would be that listing
in catalog file

26:54.280 --> 26:55.530
for

26:57.700 --> 27:01.077
19th century American poet,

27:03.497 --> 27:05.581
Emily Dickens, please?

27:05.791 --> 27:07.792
In the catalog room on the left.

27:09.503 --> 27:11.379
But you won't find
any such listing.

27:13.257 --> 27:15.174
Oh, I won't find that listing?

27:16.844 --> 27:20.221
Why wouldn't I find it?

27:23.392 --> 27:26.477
Charles Dickens is an English writer.

27:27.396 --> 27:29.689
There is no American poet
by the name of Dickens.

27:34.320 --> 27:38.531
I'm sorry. No, that is,
I'm sure, American poet.

27:41.035 --> 27:42.035
Emily Dickens.

27:42.119 --> 27:43.244
Listen!

27:43.996 --> 27:45.747
- D-I...
- I told you!

27:46.749 --> 27:47.999
There's no such person.

27:48.459 --> 27:50.418
- Do you want me to draw you a picture?
- No.

27:50.502 --> 27:53.504
- I'm telling you, you hear me?
- All right.

28:09.980 --> 28:12.273
It's all right, it's all right.

28:18.781 --> 28:20.365
Just lie still.

28:21.492 --> 28:22.992
Let the doctor take care of everything.

28:25.996 --> 28:27.497
You're so beautiful.

28:28.957 --> 28:32.126
Yes! How did you get
to be so beautiful?

28:36.465 --> 28:38.966
I think I'm going to die.

28:42.096 --> 28:44.138
No, no, no.

28:44.223 --> 28:47.266
No, your pulse...

28:47.851 --> 28:51.270
Your pulse is fine. It's steady.

28:52.481 --> 28:54.524
You're going to live to be 100.

29:57.838 --> 29:59.922
Why I am so tired?

30:01.633 --> 30:06.554
The doctor thinks you need to get some color
into that beautiful white skin of yours.

30:06.638 --> 30:09.849
I'm going to take you
to see my brother.

30:09.933 --> 30:12.518
He is the best doctor going.

30:15.230 --> 30:16.397
No, but you...

30:16.482 --> 30:17.607
Oh, you thought I was a doctor?

30:17.941 --> 30:20.359
No. No, I'm a biologist.

30:21.528 --> 30:22.778
Have you been eating properly lately?

30:23.071 --> 30:26.032
Yes! Oh, yes! I am...

30:27.534 --> 30:31.746
I am six months in here, in US and...

30:34.041 --> 30:38.753
So I eat more good now
than in my life.

30:39.922 --> 30:43.049
You could've fallen behind with iron
and never had a chance to catch up.

30:44.259 --> 30:48.262
Look, I'm going to go now
but may I come back later?

30:48.388 --> 30:50.723
No, don't answer that.
I'll be back.

30:56.146 --> 30:57.605
Okay?

31:00.067 --> 31:01.567
Yeah, okay.

31:27.302 --> 31:29.011
How long you have been there?

31:29.972 --> 31:32.848
Just long enough to get dinner started.

31:34.309 --> 31:36.143
You look much better.

31:38.480 --> 31:40.648
What did you do here?

31:42.693 --> 31:43.943
It looks beautiful.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.988
We're having calf's liver,

31:47.656 --> 31:51.951
prepared Veneziano in a special
vinaigrette sauce,

31:52.035 --> 31:53.703
loaded with iron,

31:53.787 --> 31:57.290
and leeks filled with iron.

31:57.374 --> 31:59.500
Also will improve the timbre of your voice.

32:00.210 --> 32:06.882
You know, Nero had leek served to him
every day to deepen his voice.

32:07.092 --> 32:08.926
No, I didn't know that.

32:09.344 --> 32:14.098
So that he could croon while he had Seneca
drawn and quartered.

32:15.642 --> 32:16.767
Let me help you there.

32:16.852 --> 32:18.853
No, no! You're not to move.

32:25.444 --> 32:28.154
Will <i>madame</i> taste the wine?

32:29.865 --> 32:32.283
"Château Margaux Grand Cru."

32:35.370 --> 32:37.246
My God!

32:37.331 --> 32:40.541
Special day, special wine.

33:05.859 --> 33:08.027
You know, when you...

33:10.072 --> 33:13.324
When you live a good life

33:15.202 --> 33:19.163
like a saint and then you die,

33:22.334 --> 33:27.213
that must be what they make you
to drink in paradise.

33:32.594 --> 33:33.594
Yeah.

33:41.353 --> 33:43.145
Thomas Wolfe.

33:51.154 --> 33:53.948
<i>Look Homeward, Angel.</i>

33:57.202 --> 33:58.577
Oh, God!

33:59.454 --> 34:02.039
What does Wolfe sound like in Polish?

34:18.473 --> 34:21.058
A stone, a leaf, an unfound door.

34:25.355 --> 34:26.397
Of a stone.

34:27.774 --> 34:28.774
A leaf.

34:30.402 --> 34:31.902
- The door.
- The door.

34:37.159 --> 34:38.534
Of all the forgotten faces.

34:38.618 --> 34:40.286
Forgotten faces.

34:41.371 --> 34:44.165
God! This is a first.

34:48.837 --> 34:51.547
Hearing Thomas Wolfe read aloud in Polish.

34:51.630 --> 34:57.011
Yeah, the first for me too hearing
that Wolfe read in English.

35:00.849 --> 35:04.518
God, if that poor bastard Wolfe had heard you
read this aloud in Polish,

35:04.603 --> 35:05.686
he would've written in Polish.

35:05.771 --> 35:07.104
No, I don't think so.

35:07.189 --> 35:09.315
Oh, yeah! Oh, yes!

35:14.529 --> 35:16.155
You were...

35:16.740 --> 35:19.033
You were in a concentration camp?

35:22.704 --> 35:24.371
Yeah, I can't...

35:26.458 --> 35:28.292
Can't talk about that, though.

35:28.376 --> 35:29.376
I'm sorry.

35:31.379 --> 35:36.133
I have a knack for sticking my big schnoz
into places where it's got no business.

35:37.552 --> 35:38.761
I

35:40.180 --> 35:42.515
want so much to know you,

35:43.725 --> 35:45.726
to be close to you.

35:52.984 --> 35:55.402
Emily, Emily Dickinson?

35:56.363 --> 35:58.030
That's the woman?

35:58.698 --> 36:01.200
Oh, no! Oh, no!

36:02.911 --> 36:05.246
"Property of Nathan Landau."

36:06.206 --> 36:08.082
- That's you?
- That's me.

36:08.583 --> 36:09.542
It's your book?

36:09.626 --> 36:10.751
No, it's yours.

36:14.214 --> 36:15.506
Thank you!

36:16.800 --> 36:18.217
Thank you.

36:31.523 --> 36:33.899
"Ample make this bed.

36:34.985 --> 36:37.778
"Make this bed with awe.

36:39.447 --> 36:43.284
"In it, wait till judgment break,

36:44.035 --> 36:46.579
"excellent and fair.

36:48.498 --> 36:50.666
"Be its mattress straight.

36:52.127 --> 36:54.503
"Be its pillow round.

36:56.172 --> 36:59.592
"Let no sunrise yellow noise

37:00.552 --> 37:02.970
"interrupt this ground."

37:15.025 --> 37:18.277
<i>Nathan, my new and dear beloved friend,</i>

37:18.361 --> 37:24.742
<i>introduced me to what seemed the answer
to my relentless all-consuming horniness.</i>

37:25.035 --> 37:28.829
Before I went into analysis,
I was completely frigid.

37:28.914 --> 37:30.581
Can you imagine?

37:30.665 --> 37:32.750
Now all I can do is think about fucking.

37:32.834 --> 37:35.461
Wilhelm Reich has turned me into a nympho.

37:35.545 --> 37:38.672
I mean, sex on the brain!

37:39.341 --> 37:42.509
<i>Her name still curls across my tongue.</i>

37:42.677 --> 37:45.012
<i>Leslie Lapidus.</i>

37:46.514 --> 37:48.349
Door is open, come in!

37:51.686 --> 37:53.020
Hello!

38:09.162 --> 38:11.080
Boy, you look excellent.

38:11.581 --> 38:13.165
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

38:15.794 --> 38:17.169
What would you like to drink?

38:17.253 --> 38:18.629
I'll have a...

38:21.841 --> 38:24.051
I don't know, let's see.

38:27.305 --> 38:29.223
- I think I'll have a...
- Oh, my God!

38:30.058 --> 38:31.767
Oh, fuck!

38:33.395 --> 38:35.729
Fucking, fantastic fucking!

38:45.073 --> 38:46.907
Wait! Just let it ring!

38:52.297 --> 38:53.664
Hello, Mother.

38:53.748 --> 38:57.292
I'm fine, fine.
Yeah, I told you I'd be just fine.

38:57.377 --> 38:58.877
Yeah, plenty.

38:58.962 --> 39:01.380
Yeah, I'll make sure
that the plants are watered

39:01.464 --> 39:04.341
and the dog is fed.
Well, Mother...

39:04.759 --> 39:08.512
Yes, Daddy.
Yes, your little princess will be good.

39:08.596 --> 39:09.972
Okay. Bye!

39:11.766 --> 39:14.476
They go away for the weekend
and then the maid's out sick.

39:14.561 --> 39:20.816
And they carry on about how will I survive
for a weekend in this apartment by myself.

39:20.900 --> 39:24.820
And that's with this totally stocked fridge,
and a lock on every door,

39:24.946 --> 39:27.281
and God only knows what else.

39:29.451 --> 39:34.913
<i>Thus, I realized that Leslie and I
would be left to frolic in this place alone.</i>

39:34.998 --> 39:36.957
<i>My cup ran over.</i>

39:37.042 --> 39:42.546
<i>Oh, my cup turned into a spillway
flooding across the spotless carpet,</i>

39:42.630 --> 39:45.382
<i>out the door down Pierrepont Street,</i>

39:45.467 --> 39:49.470
<i>across all the twilit
carnal reaches of Brooklyn.</i>

39:50.805 --> 39:52.389
<i>Leslie.</i>

39:52.474 --> 39:55.476
<i>A weekend alone with Leslie.</i>

39:55.727 --> 40:00.272
Have you ever read D.H. Lawrence,
<i>Lady Chatterley's Lover?</i>

40:00.857 --> 40:01.916
No.

40:03.485 --> 40:07.654
He has the answers.
He knows so much about fucking.

40:08.990 --> 40:11.075
He says...

40:11.159 --> 40:14.495
He says that when you fuck,
you go to the Dark Gods.

40:16.247 --> 40:18.207
Stingo, I really mean it.

40:18.666 --> 40:22.461
To fuck is to go to the Dark Gods.

40:25.131 --> 40:27.424
Let's go to the Dark Gods!

41:05.380 --> 41:08.215
Well, I think I have the right to ask,
what is going on?

41:09.217 --> 41:11.301
You don't understand.

41:12.720 --> 41:14.888
I can't go all the way.

41:18.309 --> 41:20.727
I've reached a plateau in my analysis.

41:21.604 --> 41:24.064
Before I reach this plateau of vocalization,

41:24.149 --> 41:26.900
I could never have said
any of those words.

41:27.735 --> 41:32.739
Those Anglo-Saxon four letter words
that everybody should be able to say.

41:33.658 --> 41:36.285
Now I'm completely able to vocalize.

41:39.581 --> 41:43.750
<i>Leslie Lapidus could say "fuck,"
but she could not do it.</i>

41:50.508 --> 41:51.550
Nathan!

41:52.260 --> 41:53.927
I'm so glad you're...

41:55.388 --> 41:57.097
Yeah, little ol' Stingo.

41:59.434 --> 42:01.310
- Stingo?
- Yeah?

42:03.771 --> 42:06.523
You want to come up
and have a night hat with me?

42:06.608 --> 42:07.691
Sure.

42:08.443 --> 42:10.903
You know, when Nathan gets involved,

42:10.987 --> 42:14.948
he forgets all about the time
and I don't know.

42:17.952 --> 42:20.037
Stingo, you look...

42:20.121 --> 42:23.290
You look very nice.
You're wearing your "cocksucker."

42:25.210 --> 42:27.377
It's my seersucker.

42:27.462 --> 42:30.130
Oh, yeah. Right, seersucker.

42:43.102 --> 42:44.728
I love it here.

42:49.859 --> 42:51.777
I'm glad you couldn't sleep.

42:57.242 --> 42:59.701
You hurt your mouth?
You talk funny.

43:00.745 --> 43:02.246
I bit my tongue.

43:03.748 --> 43:05.040
You want me to get something for you?

43:05.124 --> 43:06.833
No, please, no.

43:06.918 --> 43:09.419
It just needs to be left alone.

43:10.588 --> 43:11.588
Hey, what you...

43:11.673 --> 43:13.257
You've changed all the furniture around?

43:15.009 --> 43:18.136
Yeah, you like it?
I do that when I can't sleep, you know.

43:18.221 --> 43:21.515
It's a good thing to do
because then you don't...

43:22.350 --> 43:25.185
You don't have to think about anything.

43:26.020 --> 43:27.938
Well, I better try that.

43:28.022 --> 43:29.356
Oh, no.

43:31.985 --> 43:33.777
Stingo.

43:33.861 --> 43:36.071
You do not have to move furniture.

43:39.575 --> 43:41.493
You will move mountains.

43:41.577 --> 43:43.245
Right now, I can't even move my tongue.

43:43.329 --> 43:46.039
Maybe you moved it too much.

43:49.627 --> 43:51.670
Why aren't all the women
in the world like you?

43:51.754 --> 43:53.839
You'd better thank God they're not.
Look at this.

43:53.923 --> 43:56.717
I see many, many women in your life.

43:56.801 --> 44:02.222
Many beautiful women who adore you
and who'll make all that love with you.

44:03.057 --> 44:08.145
Sometimes, I can see myself
just being alone forever.

44:09.522 --> 44:13.442
Oh, Stingo. I'm not fair with you.

44:13.735 --> 44:15.944
I think, "Oh, Stingo, he's so young.

44:16.029 --> 44:18.405
"He's a talented American." You know.

44:18.489 --> 44:23.201
"He doesn't have any real,
real problems, but..."

44:23.328 --> 44:25.912
You don't know if I'm really talented.

44:25.997 --> 44:27.664
You've never read anything I've written.

44:27.749 --> 44:32.627
Well, I mean, I don't ask you about that work
because, you know, what it's about

44:32.837 --> 44:38.091
because I know that a writer,
he likes to be quiet about his work.

44:39.927 --> 44:41.595
It's about a boy.

44:44.098 --> 44:45.332
A 12-year-old boy.

44:46.017 --> 44:49.436
- And...
- Yes, so it's autobiographical?

44:53.107 --> 44:56.068
Yeah, to a certain extent,
maybe it is.

44:57.911 --> 45:01.823
It takes place in a year,
which is the year his mother dies.

45:07.955 --> 45:10.624
I didn't know your mother died.

45:10.708 --> 45:11.958
When I was 12.

45:12.043 --> 45:14.086
You loved her very much?

45:14.170 --> 45:15.712
Not enough.

45:16.172 --> 45:18.256
What do you mean "not enough"?
What do you mean?

45:18.341 --> 45:20.258
I mean not enough.

45:25.640 --> 45:28.475
That is what is so terrible about

45:32.271 --> 45:35.982
outliving those people that we love.
I mean, that's...

45:36.484 --> 45:38.110
That guilt.

45:38.194 --> 45:39.903
Your father?

45:39.987 --> 45:42.322
My father, my mother, my husband.

45:44.659 --> 45:45.867
You were married?

45:49.372 --> 45:51.248
Yeah, I was married.

45:52.834 --> 45:58.505
When I was very young,
I was married to a disciple of my father.

45:59.507 --> 46:01.842
Assistant at the university.

46:03.010 --> 46:04.928
Your father's anti-Nazi writings,

46:05.012 --> 46:07.472
well, that probably got him in trouble.

46:07.598 --> 46:08.807
His writings.

46:08.891 --> 46:12.644
Well, one day, I was at the Mass

46:14.105 --> 46:15.605
and I have a...

46:18.276 --> 46:21.736
I had a presentiment.

46:23.030 --> 46:25.782
I had many fears and I...

46:25.867 --> 46:29.453
I run out of the church
and I go to the university,

46:29.537 --> 46:32.497
and I see that the gate is locked.

46:33.791 --> 46:36.418
And there were many, many Germans there.

46:38.379 --> 46:41.548
And I saw the professors.
They was loading them into the truck.

46:41.632 --> 46:45.719
And this one part of canvas has moved away.

46:46.554 --> 46:50.974
And I see my father's face
and the face of my husband behind him.

46:52.518 --> 46:53.977
And...

46:56.481 --> 46:57.981
I looked.

46:59.984 --> 47:01.902
But the German, he pulled that away

47:01.986 --> 47:05.280
and I never saw those faces again.

47:05.364 --> 47:07.157
They took them to Sachsenhausen, you know.

47:07.241 --> 47:10.494
That's a German work camp,
but they shot them the next day.

47:10.578 --> 47:12.787
That's what we have heard.

47:17.293 --> 47:18.460
Your mother?

47:18.544 --> 47:19.669
My mother...

47:20.880 --> 47:22.380
My mother got

47:24.759 --> 47:27.928
tuberculosis and...

47:29.847 --> 47:32.307
Oh, she is very sick, you know.

47:32.391 --> 47:35.894
She started to die of that,
and I can't do anything.

47:38.523 --> 47:41.441
But I think if I could get <i>mieso...</i>

47:41.526 --> 47:44.986
If I could get that meat for my mother,
I would make her strong.

47:45.071 --> 47:47.280
So I go to the country,

47:48.115 --> 47:51.868
and the peasants there,
they're selling ham.

47:52.870 --> 47:56.289
And I go with that black market money,

47:56.374 --> 47:58.750
I buy that and I bring it back.

47:58.834 --> 48:00.418
But, you know,
this is forbidden because

48:00.503 --> 48:03.421
all the meat goes to the Germans, you know.

48:03.506 --> 48:05.131
If you get caught...

48:05.216 --> 48:09.553
So I hid the ham under my skirt
on the train.

48:09.637 --> 48:12.556
I'm pretending that I'm pregnant, you know.

48:13.082 --> 48:14.599
I was so afraid!

48:15.309 --> 48:16.643
I was shaking.

48:16.727 --> 48:19.020
And then that German,

48:21.399 --> 48:24.901
who was in the front of the train,
and he saw me.

48:24.986 --> 48:27.904
And I'm sitting there
and he came up to me

48:27.989 --> 48:30.824
and he take under my skirt that ham.

48:37.957 --> 48:40.417
So they sent me to Auschwitz.

48:42.962 --> 48:46.256
You were sent to Auschwitz
because you stole a ham?

48:46.340 --> 48:50.135
No. I was sent to Auschwitz
because they saw that I was afraid.

48:53.639 --> 48:55.265
Oh, yeah.

48:56.475 --> 48:57.601
You know what that means?

48:57.685 --> 48:58.727
Yeah.

48:59.770 --> 49:02.439
You tried to commit suicide in Auschwitz?

49:03.649 --> 49:06.234
No, it was after that.

49:06.319 --> 49:08.278
After that, I was in...

49:11.490 --> 49:12.866
After liberation.

49:12.950 --> 49:14.326
After you were safe?

49:14.952 --> 49:16.786
Yes, safe, yeah.

49:18.205 --> 49:22.626
I was safe. I was in Sweden.
I was in that refugee camp.

49:24.045 --> 49:27.339
I mean, that was good.
They try to help you, you know.

49:27.423 --> 49:29.799
They try to...

49:29.884 --> 49:32.385
They try, but...

49:38.017 --> 49:39.517
I knew that

49:41.228 --> 49:46.775
Christ had turned his face away from me.

49:47.860 --> 49:51.655
And that only a Jesus
who no longer cared for me

49:51.739 --> 49:54.908
could kill those people that I love,

49:57.161 --> 50:01.915
but leave me alive with my shame.

50:01.999 --> 50:04.959
Oh, God. So I went to that church.

50:05.711 --> 50:08.088
And I took the glass, I knelt down

50:08.172 --> 50:12.384
and I cut my wrist.

50:12.468 --> 50:15.428
But I didn't die, of course.

50:17.181 --> 50:19.099
Of course not.

50:30.861 --> 50:35.323
Stingo, there's so many things
you don't understand.

50:38.077 --> 50:41.538
There's so many things that I

50:42.289 --> 50:45.792
cannot tell you.

50:45.918 --> 50:47.636
I want you to trust me.

50:51.507 --> 50:53.842
I want you to trust me.

50:55.761 --> 50:57.387
Just trust me.

51:08.983 --> 51:12.652
Oh, God! There is Nathan!

51:14.947 --> 51:16.406
Nathan!

51:18.117 --> 51:20.493
- Sophie!
- Astrid!

51:22.329 --> 51:25.373
I'm working night duty
at Brooklyn Hospital this week.

51:25.458 --> 51:27.751
My patient is this old lady
who's meaner than my mother,

51:27.835 --> 51:29.002
if you can believe.

51:29.086 --> 51:32.380
Well, good night, Astrid.
Have a good sleep.

51:33.966 --> 51:36.676
That was Astrid, you know.

51:36.761 --> 51:38.344
Maybe I'll leave the door open.

51:38.429 --> 51:40.722
In case he comes, we could hear him.

51:40.806 --> 51:42.348
So you want another drink?

51:44.101 --> 51:45.894
- Your bottle is empty.
- Well...

51:47.188 --> 51:50.523
Oh, I know where Nathan keeps
another bottle.

51:54.153 --> 51:56.488
Be careful, it's dark in here.

52:02.495 --> 52:03.745
Oh, God.

52:03.829 --> 52:07.499
I think you'll feel better
if we just call him at the lab.

52:08.542 --> 52:10.210
I can't do that.

52:10.294 --> 52:14.964
I mean, he doesn't like for me to call him.
You know, at work.

52:15.299 --> 52:17.592
So, anyway.

52:18.969 --> 52:21.054
I did it an hour ago.

52:21.180 --> 52:23.932
And there was no answer, so.

52:24.016 --> 52:25.517
I'm sure the switchboard's just shut off.

52:25.601 --> 52:28.978
Yes, I think that's right.
I'm sure that...

52:29.063 --> 52:31.397
You know, sometimes when
he can't sleep at night,

52:31.482 --> 52:34.901
he goes and he walks
all over the city.

52:35.027 --> 52:38.488
Yeah, he goes into all these neighborhoods.

52:38.572 --> 52:42.534
I mean, I don't know where he goes,
but once he came back,

52:42.618 --> 52:48.414
he had a black eye and his jaw
was all swollen there.

52:48.499 --> 52:51.251
Yeah, I thought it was broken.

52:54.588 --> 52:57.257
You know, he could be hurt.

52:57.341 --> 53:01.553
I don't know where he is, but I think
we should call the police right now.

53:01.637 --> 53:04.472
No, look, I think we ought to wait two hours.

53:04.598 --> 53:07.225
You know, just wait till somebody
is on the switchboard there.

53:07.309 --> 53:08.685
We'll just call him then.

53:08.769 --> 53:12.689
He's working late. He probably
just got tired and fell asleep there.

53:12.773 --> 53:16.442
Yeah. He's probably asleep there.

53:18.529 --> 53:19.529
I'm sure.

53:19.613 --> 53:21.114
I'm sure you're right.

53:26.120 --> 53:28.454
Look at this. <i>The Nazi Primer.</i>

53:31.542 --> 53:34.252
He must have everything ever written
about the Nazis in those years.

53:34.336 --> 53:38.332
Yes, he is obsessed with the Nazis
that are escaping justice.

53:40.259 --> 53:42.802
Do you suppose all this started
after he met you?

53:43.053 --> 53:46.890
Look, I know I shouldn't tell him
about that place,

53:46.974 --> 53:48.766
but what could I do?

53:48.851 --> 53:51.769
- I know it's my fault that he...
- Look, I can understand.

53:52.646 --> 53:53.980
After all, he is a Jew.

53:54.940 --> 53:58.693
Yes, he is a Jew,
but don't you think that I'm angry, too?

53:58.777 --> 54:03.072
That these men, these terrible Nazis live,
and my father...

54:03.157 --> 54:06.326
Such a good man
who tries to help Jews is killed.

54:06.660 --> 54:08.578
Don't you think that I am angry?

54:08.662 --> 54:11.623
But, you know, you don't understand Nathan.

54:13.292 --> 54:15.418
You don't know.

54:20.591 --> 54:24.093
Him, what he might do, you know.
I think...

54:24.178 --> 54:25.219
Sometimes I think...

54:25.304 --> 54:26.638
What do you think?

54:30.559 --> 54:32.352
What do you think, Polish baby?

54:32.436 --> 54:33.686
Oh, Nathan!

54:36.273 --> 54:37.941
You are all right?

54:38.025 --> 54:39.651
I'm all right.
What about the two of you?

54:41.320 --> 54:45.715
Yeah, well, I was so frightened, you know.
I was stupid.

54:46.992 --> 54:49.577
I got so scared, you know,
I thought something had happened to you.

54:49.662 --> 54:52.705
I would've called, but I didn't want
to take the chance of waking you up.

54:52.790 --> 54:54.707
We're on to something in our work.
Something big.

54:54.792 --> 54:56.084
- Yeah?
- Something very big.

54:56.168 --> 54:57.669
That's wonderful, Nathan.

55:01.382 --> 55:03.132
Yeah, wonderful.

55:14.186 --> 55:16.104
But you were here

55:18.607 --> 55:20.108
with Sophie.

55:21.235 --> 55:24.153
Yes, Stingo, you know, he...

55:24.238 --> 55:26.664
Stingo came home from his date.

55:28.033 --> 55:32.412
So I heard the door, I thought it was you.
So I run out, but...

55:33.080 --> 55:36.708
Anyway, I called him, I said,
"Why don't you come up for a drink?"

55:36.792 --> 55:42.171
Because I was worried
and he was a very good friend to me.

55:42.256 --> 55:44.924
He was keeping me company.

55:59.606 --> 56:04.068
So now you've seen my sanctum sanctorum.

56:05.571 --> 56:09.073
Now you know all of Nathan's
dark and dour secrets.

56:10.242 --> 56:11.701
Hardly.

56:18.625 --> 56:22.462
They wipe out six million Jews

56:24.423 --> 56:26.466
and the world lets them escape.

56:29.678 --> 56:33.431
Wanna join me in a little lynching party,
Southern boy?

56:33.557 --> 56:36.309
I expect you might have
a lot to teach me there.

56:37.770 --> 56:40.271
I'm going to call it a night here.

56:40.355 --> 56:42.065
Stingo, wait.

56:42.149 --> 56:45.151
Stingo is our best friend.
Why do you do that?

56:46.153 --> 56:48.863
He is our best friend.
He deserves only our thanks.

56:48.947 --> 56:51.616
Nathan, listen to me.

56:51.700 --> 56:56.287
I was frightened, I didn't know what I would do
if he had not been here.

57:02.878 --> 57:04.378
It's true.

57:14.181 --> 57:16.724
Forgive me, old buddy. I'm sorry.

57:17.434 --> 57:19.393
Of course my beloved Sophie is right.

57:19.478 --> 57:20.436
Yeah.

57:20.521 --> 57:22.146
I must've got crazy with the work, you know.

57:22.231 --> 57:23.231
I know you do.

57:23.315 --> 57:24.273
We're on to something big.

57:24.358 --> 57:25.358
I know, darling.

57:25.442 --> 57:28.277
I'm just another mad scientist,
we're all a bunch of nuts.

57:28.362 --> 57:30.321
Come on...

57:30.906 --> 57:32.323
I'm leaving.

57:33.951 --> 57:35.785
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

57:36.245 --> 57:37.411
Thank you for taking care of Sophie.

57:37.496 --> 57:39.372
Yeah, all right.

57:46.421 --> 57:48.881
Oh, Nathan!

57:50.134 --> 57:52.135
I'm sorry.

57:56.390 --> 57:58.307
Darling, I'm home.

58:03.105 --> 58:04.772
- Right!
- Are you all right?

58:04.857 --> 58:05.857
Yeah. Yeah.

58:05.941 --> 58:07.316
Are you sure?

58:07.401 --> 58:08.651
Yeah.

58:08.735 --> 58:11.487
Don't you catch things in the South?

58:13.866 --> 58:14.824
How's it going?

58:14.908 --> 58:16.450
Fine. It's going well.

58:16.535 --> 58:17.910
Think fast!

58:19.163 --> 58:20.204
Jesus!

58:22.708 --> 58:24.500
You came in and you wreck everything.

58:24.585 --> 58:27.795
Yetta, you know, always provides the best.

58:27.880 --> 58:29.672
The best you can find in Brooklyn!

58:30.799 --> 58:32.592
Oh, shit!

58:34.386 --> 58:37.388
Sophie should be taking a nap after work.

58:39.433 --> 58:41.684
She just doesn't sleep anymore.
Not since the war.

58:41.768 --> 58:42.768
How's it going?

58:42.853 --> 58:44.854
Yeah, fine. Thank you.

58:44.938 --> 58:46.439
Well, let me take a look at those.

58:46.523 --> 58:48.065
- No. No, no, no!
- Come on!

58:48.150 --> 58:51.861
I won't interfere, I won't make any comments.
I won't even...

58:51.945 --> 58:54.363
Look, I've shown this to no one.
No one's seen this.

58:54.448 --> 58:57.366
Yeah, but I'm not no one.
I'm a friend.

58:57.451 --> 58:58.743
Don't you have those down South?

58:58.827 --> 59:00.161
"Friend," a person attached to another

59:00.245 --> 59:02.163
by a feeling of personal regard or affection.

59:02.247 --> 59:03.873
- Look.
- One who offers assistance.

59:03.957 --> 59:04.916
A patron, a supporter.

59:05.000 --> 59:07.084
Look, I vowed to myself
when I started this,

59:07.169 --> 59:08.252
I was not going to show it to anyone

59:08.337 --> 59:10.338
until I finish the very last sentence.

59:10.422 --> 59:12.465
Then only after that,
can I offer it to any person.

59:12.549 --> 59:13.691
Well...

59:15.219 --> 59:18.888
Okay. You mean, you're just terrified
that somebody won't like it.

59:18.972 --> 59:20.514
Terrified as in filled with terror.

59:20.599 --> 59:23.267
Terror, a sharp, overmastering, intense fear.

59:23.393 --> 59:25.561
- All right, all right!
- That which renders the victim chicken shit.

59:25.646 --> 59:27.688
Yeah, all right, all right.

59:29.650 --> 59:31.734
That will give you some idea.

59:31.818 --> 59:32.985
Oh, my God!

59:35.489 --> 59:37.531
What about the page in the typewriter?

59:37.616 --> 59:38.950
No, this is a...

59:39.993 --> 59:42.036
Nathan! Stop!

59:42.746 --> 59:44.247
All right.

59:45.582 --> 59:48.876
Stingo! What is the worst that can happen?

59:49.670 --> 59:51.837
I may discover you can't write! Bye!

59:51.922 --> 59:52.922
Shit! Fuck!

59:53.006 --> 59:54.715
Nathan, get back here!

59:54.800 --> 59:57.176
It's beyond your reach now, old buddy!

59:59.930 --> 01:00:01.430
Fine, right!

01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:05.351
Stingo, wait a minute!

01:00:06.311 --> 01:00:10.022
Wait! Nathan have ordered me
to take you to the movies.

01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:12.900
He made me your guardian
while he read that.

01:00:12.985 --> 01:00:16.612
Yes, so you don't do
no violence to yourself now.

01:00:21.994 --> 01:00:23.536
Nathan must have finished reading that.

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:24.620
Yeah.

01:00:24.705 --> 01:00:25.913
Come on, let's go see.

01:00:25.998 --> 01:00:27.581
I think I'll wait in my room.

01:00:28.308 --> 01:00:29.500
No, come on!

01:00:29.584 --> 01:00:32.253
If he's got something to say to me,
let him come down and tell me.

01:00:32.337 --> 01:00:33.921
Yes, don't be silly.

01:01:19.426 --> 01:01:20.593
Bravo.

01:02:42.259 --> 01:02:43.759
On this bridge,

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:49.098
on which so many great American writers
have stood and reached out for words

01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:51.183
to give America its voice,

01:02:54.312 --> 01:02:57.231
looking toward the land
that gave us Whitman,

01:02:57.524 --> 01:03:02.194
from its Eastern edge dreamt his country's future
and gave it words,

01:03:05.073 --> 01:03:06.532
on this span

01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:10.786
of which Thomas Wolfe and Hart Crane wrote,

01:03:13.874 --> 01:03:18.461
we welcome Stingo
into that pantheon of the gods,

01:03:19.963 --> 01:03:23.340
whose words are all we know of immortality.

01:03:29.764 --> 01:03:31.974
To Stingo!

01:03:43.904 --> 01:03:46.989
<i>How could I have failed
to have the most helpless crush</i>

01:03:47.073 --> 01:03:51.494
<i>on such a generous mind
and life-enlarging mentor?</i>

01:03:52.537 --> 01:03:57.124
<i>Nathan was utterly, fatally glamorous.</i>

01:03:58.251 --> 01:03:59.460
Sophie!

01:04:01.087 --> 01:04:02.630
We did it!

01:04:03.590 --> 01:04:05.549
- Stingo!
- Nathan!

01:04:10.972 --> 01:04:12.014
We did it!

01:04:12.098 --> 01:04:13.807
What? What did you do?

01:04:21.191 --> 01:04:22.441
Nathan!

01:04:24.986 --> 01:04:26.362
Remember I told you the day
when I came home

01:04:26.446 --> 01:04:27.530
and I said we were on to something big?

01:04:27.614 --> 01:04:29.031
- Yeah.
- Today, we cracked it.

01:04:29.115 --> 01:04:31.033
What? What? What?

01:04:33.578 --> 01:04:35.788
I can't tell you.
I'll tell you about it all tonight.

01:04:35.872 --> 01:04:37.289
No, what's a few hours make?

01:04:37.374 --> 01:04:39.542
No, I can't tell you!

01:04:39.626 --> 01:04:40.834
Come on!

01:04:41.753 --> 01:04:43.462
Pretty soon, the whole world will know.

01:04:43.547 --> 01:04:44.547
Oh, God.

01:04:44.631 --> 01:04:49.051
One of the greatest medical advances
of all time.

01:04:50.845 --> 01:04:52.013
I can't tell you.

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:54.682
Come on.

01:04:54.766 --> 01:04:59.186
I'm talking about Stockholm.
Next year, the three of us together.

01:04:59.771 --> 01:05:01.355
I'm talking Nobel-fucking-Prize!

01:05:01.439 --> 01:05:02.398
Oh, my God.

01:05:02.482 --> 01:05:05.317
Sorry, kid, I'm going to get there first!

01:05:06.027 --> 01:05:08.362
Wait! I got something for you to celebrate!

01:05:08.572 --> 01:05:10.781
Oh, no! What is that?

01:05:11.825 --> 01:05:13.158
One for you.

01:05:13.243 --> 01:05:14.827
Oh, my God.

01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:18.289
- These go with that one.
- Oh, God, Nathan.

01:05:18.832 --> 01:05:21.834
Oh, Nathan! What a beautiful dress!

01:05:21.918 --> 01:05:23.252
Do you like it?

01:05:27.841 --> 01:05:29.174
Try it on.

01:05:30.176 --> 01:05:32.011
Put it on. Come on, let's get dressed.
Try it on!

01:05:32.095 --> 01:05:33.262
Oh, Nathan!

01:05:33.346 --> 01:05:34.346
Come on! Come on, come on, come on.

01:05:34.389 --> 01:05:36.348
- Could I go...
- Into the bushes! Into the bushes!

01:05:36.433 --> 01:05:39.184
Come on. Try it on.
Please, I want to see it.

01:05:39.311 --> 01:05:40.603
- Nathan, I'm not going to do that.
- I wanna see it.

01:05:40.687 --> 01:05:42.646
I just want to see it on you!

01:05:42.731 --> 01:05:44.273
All right, hold it up.

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:47.067
It doesn't have a top.

01:05:47.152 --> 01:05:48.235
You're the top.

01:05:48.403 --> 01:05:50.404
Nathan, it's beautiful!

01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:53.574
I have to get back to the laboratory.

01:05:53.658 --> 01:05:56.243
Why don't you stay
and have some lunch with us?

01:05:56.328 --> 01:05:57.286
Tonight we'll celebrate.

01:05:57.370 --> 01:05:58.370
Look at all this that I have here.

01:05:58.455 --> 01:06:01.165
I know. I can't, I can't.
I got to get back to work.

01:06:01.249 --> 01:06:02.750
Tonight we'll celebrate.

01:06:02.834 --> 01:06:04.418
Make sure Sophie gets home safe, okay?

01:06:04.544 --> 01:06:06.003
I want to see you in those clothes tonight.

01:06:06.087 --> 01:06:07.630
Look at these shoes!

01:06:07.714 --> 01:06:09.381
Tonight. Tonight I'll look at it.

01:06:11.384 --> 01:06:14.094
Oh, my darling, I'm so proud of you.

01:06:18.266 --> 01:06:19.558
Tonight.

01:06:20.852 --> 01:06:24.229
You were the one
who gave me the idea to get it.

01:06:25.181 --> 01:06:26.440
It's like mine.

01:06:26.524 --> 01:06:28.692
It's a beautiful watch, yes?

01:06:30.528 --> 01:06:33.405
Dr. Kats, my boss, you know, his wife.

01:06:34.032 --> 01:06:35.991
Her family is in the jewelry business,

01:06:36.076 --> 01:06:37.951
so he took me over there in the car

01:06:38.536 --> 01:06:39.578
to get it engraved.

01:06:39.663 --> 01:06:41.080
It probably opens at the top, like mine.

01:06:41.164 --> 01:06:43.624
What? Don't get your fingers...

01:06:43.708 --> 01:06:45.125
You got your fingerprints all over it.

01:06:45.210 --> 01:06:46.585
I got nothing on that.

01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:48.545
Anyway, you think he will like that?

01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:49.630
Sure, he will.

01:06:49.923 --> 01:06:52.257
Yeah, I think he will be very pleased.

01:06:55.345 --> 01:06:59.598
It cost a great deal of money,
more than I could afford.

01:06:59.683 --> 01:07:01.642
Anyway, who cares?

01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:04.687
Today, money doesn't seem very important.

01:07:06.981 --> 01:07:09.024
Get the champagne! Quick.

01:07:14.239 --> 01:07:16.448
This light... Get them!

01:07:16.533 --> 01:07:18.867
- I got it!
- Champagne is in the back!

01:07:18.993 --> 01:07:22.079
I couldn't remember Nathan's brand
when I went to the store.

01:07:22.163 --> 01:07:23.330
Yeah? What kind?

01:07:23.415 --> 01:07:26.208
The guy at the shop said something Rosé.

01:07:26.292 --> 01:07:28.127
The guy at the shop said it's very good.

01:07:31.715 --> 01:07:34.133
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

01:07:34.509 --> 01:07:37.386
Is this the brand you said you liked?
I couldn't remember.

01:07:42.016 --> 01:07:44.309
Stingo got you that champagne.

01:07:45.395 --> 01:07:46.478
Yeah.

01:07:47.021 --> 01:07:48.480
That's sweet.

01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:51.608
It's beautiful. Look at you.

01:07:51.735 --> 01:07:52.985
Yeah, do you like?

01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:54.069
Very becoming.

01:07:55.155 --> 01:07:57.489
Fidelity would become you more.

01:07:59.159 --> 01:08:00.159
What?

01:08:01.327 --> 01:08:05.289
Haven't I told you that the only thing
I absolutely demand of you,

01:08:05.957 --> 01:08:09.084
the only single thing is fidelity?

01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:15.090
And didn't I tell you that
if you ever were with this guy Kats

01:08:15.717 --> 01:08:17.259
ever again outside of work,

01:08:17.343 --> 01:08:20.929
that if you ever so much as walked 10 feet
with this cheap schmuck, this fraud,

01:08:21.055 --> 01:08:22.598
- that I would break your ass?
- Yeah, but...

01:08:22.682 --> 01:08:23.807
And this afternoon,

01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:25.768
- he brings you home again in his car.
- Yeah, but...

01:08:25.852 --> 01:08:29.104
You spent the whole fucking afternoon with him,
didn't you? Didn't you?

01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:32.064
Or should I say, you spent
the whole afternoon with him fucking?

01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:33.192
Nathan...

01:08:33.276 --> 01:08:34.894
Did you try on your new dress for him?

01:08:36.196 --> 01:08:39.072
So he could strip it off you
in a cheap hotel room?

01:08:39.157 --> 01:08:42.283
Did he line up your vertebrae
in a nice neat line

01:08:42.368 --> 01:08:43.577
while he was humping you?

01:08:43.661 --> 01:08:46.955
I bet he does quite a number with that
fast chiropractor's dick of his, huh?

01:08:47.081 --> 01:08:48.582
- No. Wait! Nathan!
- Come on, you can tell me.

01:08:49.167 --> 01:08:51.376
How do you know he took her home?
What have you been doing?

01:08:51.461 --> 01:08:52.461
You were following her all afternoon?

01:08:52.545 --> 01:08:53.545
Stingo...

01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:56.548
What if you find out
why Kats took her home?

01:08:57.341 --> 01:08:58.884
I think you're going to feel like a fool.

01:08:58.968 --> 01:09:00.469
Just find out why he took her home.

01:09:00.553 --> 01:09:02.054
Please, don't!

01:09:03.288 --> 01:09:07.893
Our baby Southern artiste
defending a little Polack whore.

01:09:09.938 --> 01:09:13.941
Too bad our celebration will be
of more mundane stripe than I had intended.

01:09:14.024 --> 01:09:15.651
Stingo, I think that you should go...

01:09:15.734 --> 01:09:17.319
I'm not going to leave you alone with him.

01:09:17.403 --> 01:09:19.112
You don't understand,
you're making it worse by being here.

01:09:19.197 --> 01:09:20.738
No! He's not going to get away
with this shit!

01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:22.366
You don't understand him.

01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:24.326
Let's just cut out all the ugly shit!

01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:26.745
Yeah, pour this. Let's celebrate.
You know what?

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:28.622
We're here to toast you.

01:09:28.706 --> 01:09:30.374
But what are we doing here?
What are we here to toast?

01:09:30.457 --> 01:09:31.542
You're right. You're right.
I'm terribly sorry.

01:09:31.626 --> 01:09:32.626
That's all right.

01:09:32.710 --> 01:09:34.419
I don't know what's come over me.

01:09:37.048 --> 01:09:39.466
Here is to my best friend

01:09:41.094 --> 01:09:42.636
- and my best girl.
- There we go.

01:09:42.929 --> 01:09:45.721
Here, yeah.
Look what I got you, anyway.

01:09:50.435 --> 01:09:52.770
I had the wrapping, but...

01:09:55.942 --> 01:09:58.277
It's beautiful. That's really beautiful.

01:09:58.361 --> 01:09:59.361
Do you like it?

01:09:59.445 --> 01:10:01.947
I like it? Like it? I love it.

01:10:02.031 --> 01:10:05.117
Yes. It's just like Stingo's.

01:10:05.994 --> 01:10:07.202
It is?

01:10:08.705 --> 01:10:09.746
Oh, yeah.

01:10:09.831 --> 01:10:11.373
It has an engraving.

01:10:11.457 --> 01:10:13.000
It's beautiful. Beautiful.

01:10:16.963 --> 01:10:19.798
This toast is in honor

01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:26.013
of my complete disassociation
from you two creeps.

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:27.723
Disassociation from you,

01:10:28.516 --> 01:10:31.602
the coony chiropractic cunt of Kings County,

01:10:31.686 --> 01:10:34.479
and you, the dreary dregs of Dixie.

01:10:38.651 --> 01:10:41.153
You've not fooled me, young Stingo.

01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:46.325
Since you so graciously allowed me
to read your magnum Southern opus,

01:10:47.327 --> 01:10:50.662
your puling, adolescent self-pity

01:10:51.414 --> 01:10:53.206
for your poor dead mother.

01:10:53.291 --> 01:10:54.917
Knock it off, Nathan.

01:10:55.251 --> 01:10:58.211
However, look on it optimistically.

01:10:58.296 --> 01:11:00.923
You might be on the verge
of a whole new form,

01:11:01.007 --> 01:11:03.091
the Southern comic book.

01:11:04.302 --> 01:11:05.469
And now, my sweet, my sweet.

01:11:05.553 --> 01:11:06.678
Stingo...

01:11:06.763 --> 01:11:10.766
I want to ask you one question
that's been burning in my mind for so long.

01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:14.019
Yeah, well, maybe you can explain
something to me.

01:11:14.479 --> 01:11:18.440
The reason maybe of why you are here.

01:11:18.524 --> 01:11:19.733
Wait...

01:11:20.318 --> 01:11:24.821
Walking these streets drenched
in enticing perfumery...

01:11:26.699 --> 01:11:29.785
engaged in surreptitious venery

01:11:30.536 --> 01:11:34.331
with not one, but two.

01:11:34.415 --> 01:11:37.292
Count them, ladies and gentlemen.

01:11:38.252 --> 01:11:41.046
Two chiropractors.

01:11:41.172 --> 01:11:45.801
In short, making hay while the sun shines,

01:11:45.885 --> 01:11:48.512
to employ an old bromide,

01:11:48.596 --> 01:11:50.013
while at Auschwitz,

01:11:50.098 --> 01:11:53.850
the ghosts of the millions of the dead
still seek an answer.

01:11:53.935 --> 01:11:55.018
No.

01:11:56.062 --> 01:11:57.396
Tell me.

01:11:58.272 --> 01:11:59.523
Tell me, Sophie.

01:11:59.691 --> 01:12:01.084
The same anti-Semitism

01:12:02.068 --> 01:12:05.070
for which Poland has gained
such worldwide renown,

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:08.573
did a similar anti-Semitism
guide your own destiny,

01:12:08.658 --> 01:12:10.826
help you along,
protect you in a manner of speaking,

01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:14.079
so that you became one of the
minuscule handful of people who lived

01:12:14.872 --> 01:12:17.332
while the millions died?

01:12:19.127 --> 01:12:21.712
Tell me. Tell me why.

01:12:23.423 --> 01:12:25.841
Explanation, please!

01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:32.431
Tell me why, old lucky number 11379.

01:12:33.141 --> 01:12:39.479
Tell me why you inhabit
the land of the living.

01:12:39.564 --> 01:12:42.816
What splendid little tricks and stratagem

01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:44.776
sprang from that lovely head of yours

01:12:44.861 --> 01:12:48.488
to allow you to breath
the clear Polish air,

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:55.662
while the multitudes at Auschwitz
choked slowly on the gas?

01:12:55.747 --> 01:12:56.705
No!

01:12:56.789 --> 01:12:57.748
Explain!

01:12:57.874 --> 01:12:59.458
- Stop it!
- Explain!

01:12:59.542 --> 01:13:00.709
Lay off of her!

01:13:00.793 --> 01:13:02.335
Get out of my way!

01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:04.629
Get out of my...

01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:08.383
Stay away! Stay out!

01:13:09.302 --> 01:13:11.636
Stay out! Get out of here!

01:13:11.846 --> 01:13:13.221
Go away!

01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:18.393
I'm leaving the house, they're here.

01:13:18.478 --> 01:13:21.855
I come back, two empty rooms.
No Nathan, no Sophie.

01:13:21.939 --> 01:13:23.190
And the last anybody knows,

01:13:23.274 --> 01:13:25.901
he puts her in a cab
and he runs off the other way.

01:13:25.985 --> 01:13:27.402
I can't tell you how hurt I was.

01:13:27.487 --> 01:13:29.071
- Is this Dr. Blackstock?
- <i>Yes.</i>

01:13:29.155 --> 01:13:31.865
Listen, I'm a friend of Sophie Zawistowska's,

01:13:31.949 --> 01:13:33.658
and you may have heard, I'm Stingo.

01:13:33.743 --> 01:13:36.578
<i>Oh, the writer!
Sophie's very proud of you.</i>

01:13:36.662 --> 01:13:39.289
Yeah. Listen, I'm trying to track her down.

01:13:39.373 --> 01:13:41.208
<i>But don't you live in the same house?</i>

01:13:42.375 --> 01:13:43.627
She moved out last night.

01:13:43.711 --> 01:13:44.753
<i>Moved out?</i>

01:13:44.837 --> 01:13:46.755
<i>When she called in this morning,
she wasn't well.</i>

01:13:46.839 --> 01:13:50.258
<i>I was worried about her.
She's such a darling girl.</i>

01:13:50.343 --> 01:13:52.844
Listen, do you have any idea
how I can find her?

01:13:52.929 --> 01:13:54.888
<i>What about the boyfriend?</i>

01:13:56.348 --> 01:13:57.574
I think that's over.

01:13:58.059 --> 01:13:59.935
<i>Maybe she went to stay with a friend.</i>

01:14:01.854 --> 01:14:03.688
I don't know any friends of hers.

01:14:04.023 --> 01:14:08.777
<i>There was this Polish girl
who worked for a professor at Brooklyn College.</i>

01:14:08.861 --> 01:14:12.072
<i>I remember her name.
It was Sonja Wajinska.</i>

01:14:12.782 --> 01:14:16.201
Does a woman named Sonja Wajinska work here?

01:14:16.494 --> 01:14:19.830
No, I am sorry.
She went back to Poland six months ago.

01:14:19.914 --> 01:14:22.415
But if you like,
I can give you her address.

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:23.959
Thank you.

01:14:24.043 --> 01:14:27.003
You don't happen to know a friend of hers,
Sophie Zawistowska, do you?

01:14:27.088 --> 01:14:28.255
Yes.

01:14:28.631 --> 01:14:30.882
She came here once to visit Sonja,

01:14:30.967 --> 01:14:33.176
but she did not come back again.

01:14:34.762 --> 01:14:39.808
I recognized her from my days
at the University of Krakow.

01:14:40.101 --> 01:14:43.061
She is the daughter of Professor Bieganski.

01:14:43.146 --> 01:14:44.396
Were you a student of his?

01:14:46.607 --> 01:14:49.484
I heard him lecture once.
That was enough.

01:14:50.736 --> 01:14:54.072
I know that he was very outspoken
about the Nazis.

01:14:55.158 --> 01:14:57.284
He was crazy about the Nazis.

01:14:58.077 --> 01:15:01.371
I think because they hated Jews
as much as he did.

01:15:02.415 --> 01:15:04.207
The Nazis killed him.

01:15:05.042 --> 01:15:09.045
They came one day and made a clean sweep
of all academics.

01:15:09.755 --> 01:15:13.341
And they didn't stop
to check their political convictions.

01:15:13.426 --> 01:15:15.177
I think you have the wrong man.

01:15:16.137 --> 01:15:19.139
Look, I shall show you.

01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:29.399
Bieganski.

01:15:32.695 --> 01:15:35.155
Look, Bieganski,

01:15:35.615 --> 01:15:39.451
professor of law at the University of Krakow

01:15:39.827 --> 01:15:42.787
from 1919 to 1939,

01:15:43.581 --> 01:15:46.625
known for his anti-Semitic tracts.

01:15:47.501 --> 01:15:51.213
A major promulgator of the ghetto bench rule,

01:15:51.297 --> 01:15:57.594
which made it illegal for Jewish students
to sit on the same bench as Poles.

01:15:58.554 --> 01:16:00.013
So.

01:16:01.307 --> 01:16:03.600
Astrid, your mother's on the phone.

01:16:03.684 --> 01:16:05.810
<i>I told Yetta I was leaving.</i>

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:11.775
<i>A few weeks before,
I had received a letter from my father.</i>

01:16:12.276 --> 01:16:14.527
<i>He had inherited a small farm,</i>

01:16:14.612 --> 01:16:16.821
<i>and knowing I was running out of money,</i>

01:16:16.906 --> 01:16:20.033
<i>proposed that I come back South
and live on it.</i>

01:16:20.785 --> 01:16:23.119
<i>I could not bear to stay in Brooklyn.</i>

01:16:23.871 --> 01:16:26.081
Come down, your mother's waiting.

01:16:26.165 --> 01:16:28.625
All right, already. I'm coming.

01:16:35.591 --> 01:16:37.092
Hello!

01:16:41.013 --> 01:16:42.597
Hello!

01:16:42.723 --> 01:16:45.267
Sophie, you're back.

01:16:45.559 --> 01:16:47.894
Oh, yes, hello, Yetta.

01:16:49.355 --> 01:16:51.690
I came to get the rest of my things.

01:16:52.024 --> 01:16:54.276
Have you heard from Nathan?

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:56.611
No. Not a word.

01:16:56.946 --> 01:17:00.865
Just sent some mover this morning
to get the rest of his things.

01:17:01.701 --> 01:17:02.784
Okay.

01:17:04.537 --> 01:17:06.079
Okay.

01:17:09.625 --> 01:17:10.834
Stingo?

01:17:14.839 --> 01:17:15.964
Yeah.

01:17:29.937 --> 01:17:33.440
I'm sorry about what happened last night,
you know that.

01:17:33.524 --> 01:17:39.487
I want you to know that Nathan didn't mean
what he said about your book.

01:17:43.993 --> 01:17:46.077
Well, you know that. Right?

01:17:48.456 --> 01:17:51.207
I know he really loves your writing.

01:17:52.918 --> 01:17:55.545
Look, that doesn't matter anymore.

01:18:02.094 --> 01:18:07.515
But, I mean, we will still be friends.

01:18:11.687 --> 01:18:14.773
You know, I'm leaving.
I'm going home.

01:18:17.151 --> 01:18:19.861
It should be a better place for me to write.

01:18:20.946 --> 01:18:23.365
We have driven you away.

01:18:24.617 --> 01:18:26.618
It has nothing to do with you.

01:18:39.673 --> 01:18:42.008
I spoke with Dr. Blackstock today.

01:18:47.932 --> 01:18:50.934
Oh, Stingo, did you go looking for me there?

01:18:51.477 --> 01:18:53.937
I would've left you a note
where I went,

01:18:54.021 --> 01:18:58.108
but I just didn't think of it. I'm sorry.

01:19:00.486 --> 01:19:02.487
I'm sorry you worried about me.

01:19:05.032 --> 01:19:08.493
He seemed to think that your friend Sonja
might know where you were.

01:19:09.829 --> 01:19:14.207
Sonja? Sonja Wajinska?
But she went back to Poland.

01:19:15.167 --> 01:19:16.876
Yeah, I know that.

01:19:19.004 --> 01:19:21.131
I went over to the Brooklyn College.

01:19:25.511 --> 01:19:27.679
She used to work
for a language professor there.

01:19:27.763 --> 01:19:28.888
Yes.

01:19:33.519 --> 01:19:35.562
I think you met him once.

01:19:40.734 --> 01:19:42.444
He knew your father.

01:19:45.197 --> 01:19:47.073
Yeah, my father.

01:19:53.664 --> 01:19:55.957
He heard him lecture once

01:19:57.042 --> 01:20:00.128
at the University of Krakow which, I believe,
is where your father taught.

01:20:00.212 --> 01:20:03.673
Yeah, if he told you,
then he told you about my father.

01:20:05.217 --> 01:20:07.177
Sophie, why did you lie to me?

01:20:11.515 --> 01:20:17.228
Yeah, I lied because, you know why?
I was so afraid.

01:20:18.105 --> 01:20:20.773
I was afraid I would be left alone!

01:20:24.403 --> 01:20:25.737
So...

01:20:39.919 --> 01:20:43.171
Goodbye, my friend.

01:21:24.004 --> 01:21:26.297
Sophie, I want to understand.

01:21:32.846 --> 01:21:34.931
I'd like to know the truth.

01:21:37.476 --> 01:21:38.977
The truth

01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:44.315
does not make it easier to understand,
you know.

01:21:48.112 --> 01:21:53.491
I mean, you think that you find out
the truth about me,

01:21:53.576 --> 01:21:58.037
and then you'll understand me
and then you'd forgive me for all those...

01:22:00.541 --> 01:22:02.333
For all my lies.

01:22:04.336 --> 01:22:06.713
I promise I'll never leave you.

01:22:08.173 --> 01:22:09.924
You must never promise that.

01:22:11.093 --> 01:22:14.846
No one, no one should ever promise that.

01:22:24.189 --> 01:22:25.565
Oh, the truth.

01:22:25.649 --> 01:22:28.776
The truth. I don't even know
what is the truth.

01:22:32.698 --> 01:22:35.366
After all these lies I have told.

01:22:50.507 --> 01:22:52.050
My father.

01:23:01.852 --> 01:23:06.022
<i>How can I explain
how much I loved my father?</i>

01:23:12.571 --> 01:23:17.700
<i>My father believed that human perfection
was a possibility.</i>

01:23:19.912 --> 01:23:23.831
<i>Every night I pray to God
to forgive me</i>

01:23:23.916 --> 01:23:27.502
<i>for always making a disappointment
to my father.</i>

01:23:29.588 --> 01:23:31.255
And I pray to him

01:23:32.341 --> 01:23:36.511
to make me worthy of such a great,
good man.

01:23:40.766 --> 01:23:42.183
<i>I was a grown woman.</i>

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:45.937
<i>I was fully come of age.</i>

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:48.564
<i>I was a married woman</i>

01:23:48.649 --> 01:23:53.111
<i>when I realized that I hate my father
beyond all words to tell it.</i>

01:23:56.281 --> 01:24:00.785
<i>It was winter of 1938.</i>

01:24:02.663 --> 01:24:07.709
<i>And my father was working for weeks
on the speech he calls</i>

01:24:08.711 --> 01:24:11.462
<i>"Poland Jewish Problem."</i>

01:24:14.466 --> 01:24:17.176
<i>Ordinarily I typed those speeches</i>

01:24:17.261 --> 01:24:19.971
<i>and I don't hear to the words,
to their meaning.</i>

01:24:20.055 --> 01:24:26.227
<i>But this time I came upon a word,
repeats several times,</i>

01:24:26.311 --> 01:24:28.479
<i>that I have never heard before.</i>

01:24:39.032 --> 01:24:42.201
<i>The solution for Poland Jewish Problem,</i>

01:24:42.661 --> 01:24:46.205
<i>he concludes, is</i> die Vernichtung.

01:24:50.335 --> 01:24:51.878
<i>Extermination.</i>

01:24:55.132 --> 01:24:59.469
<i>I had not meant to go
to the ghetto that afternoon,</i>

01:24:59.553 --> 01:25:02.305
<i>but something made me go there.</i>

01:25:04.016 --> 01:25:06.642
<i>I stood there,
I don't know how long,</i>

01:25:06.727 --> 01:25:10.855
<i>watching these people
that my father has condemned to die.</i>

01:25:12.691 --> 01:25:14.442
<i>For all these men, these women,</i>

01:25:14.526 --> 01:25:17.361
<i>these children,</i> die Vernichtung.

01:25:19.865 --> 01:25:21.365
<i>Extermination.</i>

01:25:23.368 --> 01:25:26.454
I suddenly remembered that my father
is waiting for that speech,

01:25:26.538 --> 01:25:29.791
and I hurry home to finish the typing,

01:25:29.875 --> 01:25:35.671
but in my rushing and my haste
to finish that,

01:25:36.256 --> 01:25:40.051
I make so many mistakes in the sentences.

01:25:41.986 --> 01:25:43.971
And I run with it to the university,

01:25:44.056 --> 01:25:48.476
and my father has no time to check that
before speaking.

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:53.481
And he get up in front of all those people,
and he reads the speech

01:25:53.565 --> 01:25:58.986
and make those mistakes
and I see him getting so angry.

01:26:00.155 --> 01:26:02.949
And when it was over,
he came up to me.

01:26:04.076 --> 01:26:06.828
I was with my husband, of course.

01:26:08.288 --> 01:26:11.916
And in front of him
and all his colleagues he said,

01:26:13.710 --> 01:26:20.091
"Zosia, your intelligence is pulp."

01:26:23.470 --> 01:26:24.762
Pulp.

01:26:27.683 --> 01:26:30.017
I did not have any courage to say,

01:26:30.102 --> 01:26:32.436
"Yes, but what about the Jews?"

01:26:33.355 --> 01:26:35.439
The Jewish people, but...

01:26:38.652 --> 01:26:43.781
After that, he didn't trust me anyway.
And neither did my husband.

01:26:57.796 --> 01:27:00.047
After that in Warsaw,

01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:03.301
I had a lover

01:27:04.553 --> 01:27:07.013
who was very, very good to me.

01:27:09.182 --> 01:27:10.641
You must help us, Sophie.

01:27:11.810 --> 01:27:13.561
Stop torturing her.

01:27:13.645 --> 01:27:17.523
<i>Jozef lived with his half-sister Wanda.</i>

01:27:17.608 --> 01:27:19.984
<i>She was a leader in the Resistance.</i>

01:27:21.153 --> 01:27:22.236
Sophie!

01:27:23.739 --> 01:27:25.156
What is that?

01:27:26.074 --> 01:27:30.328
It's a photo of children rejected
from the Germanization program.

01:27:30.787 --> 01:27:32.997
The "Lebensborn" program.

01:27:33.665 --> 01:27:35.207
These are children

01:27:35.667 --> 01:27:37.960
taken from Polish parents

01:27:39.171 --> 01:27:41.130
who, at first, were believed

01:27:41.673 --> 01:27:44.550
to have Aryan racial features.

01:27:45.093 --> 01:27:47.303
They were to be taken to Germany

01:27:47.721 --> 01:27:49.847
and raised as Germans.

01:27:51.183 --> 01:27:53.935
But, at some point, it was decided

01:27:54.186 --> 01:27:57.229
that they were racially unsuitable.

01:27:57.689 --> 01:27:59.148
Unsuitable!

01:28:02.694 --> 01:28:04.987
That's why they were consigned

01:28:06.573 --> 01:28:08.407
for disposal.

01:28:09.534 --> 01:28:14.455
All we ask of you is to translate
some stolen Gestapo documents.

01:28:14.873 --> 01:28:16.374
I can't.

01:28:17.167 --> 01:28:19.752
I cannot endanger my children.

01:28:20.128 --> 01:28:22.296
Your children could be next.

01:28:25.342 --> 01:28:29.053
No. No. I do not want to get involved.

01:28:35.352 --> 01:28:40.064
<i>Two weeks later,
the Gestapo killed Jozef.</i>

01:28:41.733 --> 01:28:43.484
<i>They cut his throat.</i>

01:28:45.862 --> 01:28:47.697
They had courage.

01:28:50.242 --> 01:28:52.743
Oh, God, they had courage.

01:28:57.082 --> 01:29:01.711
<i>Not long after they killed Jozef,
I was arrested.</i>

01:29:03.130 --> 01:29:06.507
<i>My children were sent with me
to Auschwitz.</i>

01:29:09.803 --> 01:29:12.513
<i>When the train arrived at Auschwitz,</i>

01:29:14.266 --> 01:29:17.101
<i>the Germans made the selection,</i>

01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:21.022
<i>who would live and who would die.</i>

01:29:23.025 --> 01:29:25.359
Jan, my little boy...

01:29:51.178 --> 01:29:55.222
<i>Jan, my little boy,
was sent to the</i> Kinderlager,

01:29:55.307 --> 01:29:57.767
<i>which was the children's camp.</i>

01:30:02.064 --> 01:30:06.233
<i>And my little girl, Eva,
was sent to crematorium two.</i>

01:30:11.281 --> 01:30:13.282
<i>She was exterminated.</i>

01:30:19.331 --> 01:30:25.044
<i>Thanks to my perfect German
and my secretarial skills,</i>

01:30:25.128 --> 01:30:29.673
<i>the things my father
had taught me so well,</i>

01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:34.512
<i>I came to work</i>

01:30:34.596 --> 01:30:40.267
<i>for</i> Reichsführer, <i>Rudolf Hoess,
Commandant of Auschwitz-Birkenau.</i>

01:30:43.605 --> 01:30:47.108
<i>The day they took me to work for Hoess,</i>

01:30:47.192 --> 01:30:50.194
<i>I was forced to walk past Block 25.</i>

01:30:50.570 --> 01:30:52.947
<i>That is where they took the prisoners</i>

01:30:53.031 --> 01:30:56.075
<i>that were selected for extermination.</i>

01:30:57.244 --> 01:31:02.748
<i>The people there were made
to stand for, sometimes, days.</i>

01:31:03.208 --> 01:31:06.127
<i>They were naked
and they had no water.</i>

01:31:07.420 --> 01:31:13.801
<i>And their hands reached out from the bars,
and they cried and pled.</i>

01:31:34.407 --> 01:31:36.907
This woman will be

01:31:37.367 --> 01:31:39.577
Commandant Hoess' secretary.

01:31:42.038 --> 01:31:46.000
Take her downstairs.
See that she showers thoroughly.

01:31:49.087 --> 01:31:50.546
Give me your clothes.

01:31:52.007 --> 01:31:53.757
Here is the shower.

01:31:54.843 --> 01:31:58.804
You must use this disinfectant soap.

01:31:59.806 --> 01:32:01.765
It burns and it stinks.

01:32:02.100 --> 01:32:07.104
But you must use it,
because she has a good nose.

01:32:12.194 --> 01:32:13.277
Shoes!

01:32:14.362 --> 01:32:15.696
Put your shoes here.

01:32:16.823 --> 01:32:21.327
Please don't take them.
They were a gift from my father.

01:32:23.246 --> 01:32:25.623
My God, how'd you keep them
in the camp?

01:32:26.124 --> 01:32:28.500
I hid them. Please...

01:32:31.588 --> 01:32:34.381
If she sees them,
she'll take them away.

01:32:34.633 --> 01:32:38.969
I'll clean them.
Please, they are all I have.

01:32:43.558 --> 01:32:45.142
Well, all right.

01:32:46.895 --> 01:32:48.488
Thank you.

01:32:51.107 --> 01:32:52.483
Thank you.

01:33:00.659 --> 01:33:01.659
Don't be afraid.

01:33:02.994 --> 01:33:04.495
I was told you could help us.

01:33:05.372 --> 01:33:07.164
Will you help the resistance?

01:33:08.792 --> 01:33:10.501
But what can I do?

01:33:11.169 --> 01:33:15.798
Emmi Hoess has a radio.
Her room is under her father's office

01:33:16.049 --> 01:33:19.134
where you will work.
If you could get the radio,

01:33:19.344 --> 01:33:24.014
bring it down here.
I could smuggle it out.

01:33:24.432 --> 01:33:26.600
Sure, sure, I give you the radio,

01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:31.397
you smuggle it out,
and I get shot for stealing it.

01:33:32.857 --> 01:33:35.859
That's why you must make Hoess trust you.

01:33:36.278 --> 01:33:37.820
But how?

01:33:41.408 --> 01:33:46.036
He is a man and you are a woman...

01:33:47.872 --> 01:33:49.498
Of course!

01:33:50.208 --> 01:33:53.752
Bald, starving, stinking of germicides.

01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:55.838
Very impressive!

01:33:56.089 --> 01:33:59.174
You're wrong. You look German.

01:33:59.592 --> 01:34:05.306
You speak cultured German.
You'll be working with him alone

01:34:05.557 --> 01:34:07.808
and he's an unhappy man.

01:34:08.226 --> 01:34:11.395
- Then do something for me.
- What?

01:34:12.522 --> 01:34:13.897
You must find my son.

01:34:15.233 --> 01:34:18.152
His name is Jan.
He's in the Children's Camp.

01:34:19.029 --> 01:34:20.529
What do you want to know?

01:34:22.699 --> 01:34:24.658
If... If he is...

01:34:25.702 --> 01:34:28.078
- If he's alive, right?
- Yes.

01:34:29.247 --> 01:34:30.581
I understand.

01:34:31.875 --> 01:34:35.336
Maybe Hoess could arrange
to get him out.

01:35:31.351 --> 01:35:34.812
I baked Himmler's favorite cake.

01:35:37.190 --> 01:35:39.191
This is the new

01:35:39.484 --> 01:35:41.652
secretary from the Camp.

01:35:42.737 --> 01:35:44.154
Take her to the office.

01:35:45.407 --> 01:35:47.408
Himmler can't stay for dinner.

01:36:00.755 --> 01:36:02.423
Do you think it's deliberate?

01:36:02.833 --> 01:36:04.591
Why deliberate?

01:36:05.002 --> 01:36:09.730
You said the escapes,
the delays with the building upset him.

01:36:10.798 --> 01:36:11.932
Enough!

01:36:13.101 --> 01:36:17.354
Imagine, that idiot guard took the new girl
right into the kitchen

01:36:17.497 --> 01:36:20.441
without disinfecting her.
In the kitchen!

01:36:21.234 --> 01:36:23.485
- I mean, the children...
- They are perfectly healthy.

01:36:24.654 --> 01:36:25.654
That's because they're well fed here.

01:36:26.322 --> 01:36:28.240
What happens if we leave?

01:36:31.078 --> 01:36:34.737
They will have to sacrifice
like other German children.

01:36:49.679 --> 01:36:51.221
You are looking well.

01:36:53.391 --> 01:36:55.434
I hardly drank

01:36:57.187 --> 01:36:59.563
after I left here.

01:37:00.773 --> 01:37:02.858
Can you imagine?

01:37:03.735 --> 01:37:06.737
My father asked me
what kind of medicine

01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:08.739
I practice here.

01:37:10.492 --> 01:37:12.367
What can I tell him?

01:37:13.745 --> 01:37:16.747
I perform God's work.

01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:22.002
I select who shall live
and who shall die.

01:37:23.755 --> 01:37:26.048
Is that not God's work?

01:37:27.759 --> 01:37:33.222
You're too young to recall
what was done to Germany in defeat.

01:37:33.598 --> 01:37:37.434
We cannot afford to be kind
if we are to survive.

01:37:40.688 --> 01:37:43.315
There is an epidemic
in the Children's Camp.

01:37:44.734 --> 01:37:48.779
No matter what we do,
they die like flies.

01:37:49.822 --> 01:37:52.491
You cannot afford to be so sensitive.

01:37:55.203 --> 01:37:57.788
...and lastly a trait of character

01:37:58.623 --> 01:38:02.584
common to all people of southern climes,

01:38:05.129 --> 01:38:07.214
a certain dullness of mind...

01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:10.425
Do I speak too fast?

01:38:11.636 --> 01:38:13.136
No, Commandant.

01:38:16.307 --> 01:38:17.975
Excuse me.

01:38:18.685 --> 01:38:20.018
I'm sorry to disturb you,

01:38:21.521 --> 01:38:24.439
but I thought maybe
if you could go to Berlin

01:38:24.774 --> 01:38:27.985
and explain to Himmler
how unfair his order is,

01:38:28.361 --> 01:38:29.861
maybe he'd change his mind.

01:38:29.989 --> 01:38:34.408
There's no appeal.
We're being transferred and that's that.

01:39:03.813 --> 01:39:05.647
My pills, quick!

01:39:29.172 --> 01:39:31.340
- Shall I call the doctor?
- Be quiet.

01:39:31.924 --> 01:39:33.550
It's unbearable.

01:39:46.272 --> 01:39:48.065
It's better now.

01:39:51.194 --> 01:39:54.154
That ergotamine is a miracle.

01:39:56.074 --> 01:39:58.033
I'm glad, Commandant.

01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:15.258
Sit down.

01:40:29.732 --> 01:40:31.775
How did you come here?

01:40:31.984 --> 01:40:37.030
Not many prisoners
are lucky enough to find such work.

01:40:39.867 --> 01:40:41.243
I think

01:40:42.453 --> 01:40:44.621
it must have been fate.

01:40:50.044 --> 01:40:52.587
Fate brought me to you

01:40:53.423 --> 01:40:56.675
because I knew only you
would understand.

01:40:59.762 --> 01:41:01.096
Understand what?

01:41:02.432 --> 01:41:04.683
That a mistake has been made.

01:41:11.816 --> 01:41:13.775
May I show you something?

01:41:16.237 --> 01:41:18.739
This is one of the earliest
Polish documents

01:41:20.032 --> 01:41:23.326
suggesting a "final solution"
to the Jewish problem.

01:41:23.745 --> 01:41:26.496
I helped my father to write it.

01:41:27.582 --> 01:41:31.918
Perhaps you will realize
the injustice of my imprisonment.

01:41:35.882 --> 01:41:37.466
So, you claim you are innocent.

01:41:38.092 --> 01:41:42.679
Sir, I freely admit my guilt
of the minor charge

01:41:43.055 --> 01:41:45.265
which caused me to be sent here.

01:41:48.686 --> 01:41:53.273
I only ask that this misdemeanor
be compared to my record,

01:41:54.358 --> 01:41:58.028
not only as a Polish sympathizer
with National Socialism,

01:41:58.780 --> 01:42:04.075
but as an active campaigner
in the sacred war against the Jews.

01:42:04.994 --> 01:42:09.039
That pamphlet in your hand, Commandant,
will prove my point.

01:42:09.582 --> 01:42:13.794
I implore you. You have the power
to give clemency and freedom.

01:42:14.587 --> 01:42:15.879
Please...

01:42:19.884 --> 01:42:24.471
You forget you are a Pole and, therefore,
an enemy of the Reich,

01:42:25.181 --> 01:42:27.265
and that you always will be

01:42:27.850 --> 01:42:30.227
even if you are not guilty of a crime.

01:42:48.079 --> 01:42:51.331
You've been flirting shamelessly with me.

01:42:53.125 --> 01:42:55.961
It's hard to believe you're Polish

01:42:57.171 --> 01:43:00.173
with your perfect German
and the way you look,

01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:04.594
your fair skin,
the structure of your face.

01:43:07.431 --> 01:43:09.307
So typically Aryan.

01:43:15.982 --> 01:43:19.609
You are an unusually attractive woman.

01:43:23.281 --> 01:43:26.658
There is something
about certain Aryan women,

01:43:29.537 --> 01:43:32.080
a pure and radiant beauty,

01:43:32.999 --> 01:43:34.624
fair of skin

01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:38.545
and fair of hair,

01:43:41.883 --> 01:43:43.884
that inspires me

01:43:44.677 --> 01:43:47.512
to idolize that beauty.

01:44:18.711 --> 01:44:20.128
Wait.

01:44:34.518 --> 01:44:37.187
Your pardon, sir.
A question from Frau Hoess, sir.

01:44:38.356 --> 01:44:42.359
As the child just recovered from the flu,
madam wishes to know

01:44:42.568 --> 01:44:47.280
if, in your view, Iphigenie is well enough
to go to a matinee

01:44:47.531 --> 01:44:50.408
or should she consult Dr. Schmidt?

01:44:51.452 --> 01:44:54.704
If Frau Hoess thinks she's well enough
to go to a matinee,

01:44:55.122 --> 01:44:58.458
then I expect she's well enough
to go to a matinee!

01:45:29.073 --> 01:45:32.617
I would risk a great deal
to have relations with you.

01:45:35.204 --> 01:45:38.081
If I were not leaving,
I'd take that risk.

01:45:40.209 --> 01:45:44.462
But I must go. And so must you.

01:45:45.256 --> 01:45:49.884
I'm sending you back to Block 3.
You will go tomorrow.

01:46:00.062 --> 01:46:04.024
Commandant, I know
I can't ask much for myself

01:46:04.483 --> 01:46:06.985
and that you must follow the rules.

01:46:09.697 --> 01:46:13.783
But I beg you to do one thing for me
before you send me back.

01:46:14.618 --> 01:46:18.580
I have a young son in the Camp.
His name is Jan.

01:46:20.916 --> 01:46:24.335
Jan Zawistowski. He is 10 years old.

01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:28.798
I am afraid for his health.

01:46:29.383 --> 01:46:33.136
I beg you to consider
some way to release him.

01:46:33.888 --> 01:46:36.389
He is frail, and so very young.

01:46:40.394 --> 01:46:41.644
Please.

01:46:42.271 --> 01:46:46.900
If I have impressed you, even slightly,
with my presence,

01:46:47.318 --> 01:46:49.903
I beg you to do this for me,

01:46:51.697 --> 01:46:55.116
not to release me,
just free my little boy. Please.

01:46:56.243 --> 01:46:59.913
You think you could get me
to contravene regulations

01:47:00.372 --> 01:47:03.917
because I showed some little affection?
It's disgusting.

01:47:05.169 --> 01:47:10.673
There is a legal way!
There is the "Lebensborn" program.

01:47:11.133 --> 01:47:13.301
He is a perfect candidate for it.

01:47:13.803 --> 01:47:18.556
You could move my child from the Camp
into the "Lebensborn" program.

01:47:18.974 --> 01:47:22.685
Send him to the Reich
to be raised as a good German.

01:47:23.354 --> 01:47:27.440
He is blond and looks German

01:47:28.025 --> 01:47:30.652
and speaks perfect German as I do.

01:47:32.655 --> 01:47:36.032
Don't you see how my little boy, Jan,

01:47:36.534 --> 01:47:39.327
would be so right for "Lebensborn"?

01:47:47.211 --> 01:47:50.004
I will have your son
brought here tomorrow.

01:47:50.422 --> 01:47:53.091
You will see him
and then I will arrange

01:47:53.218 --> 01:47:55.052
for him to be removed from the Camp.

01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:52.317
You have no business in this room.

01:48:53.986 --> 01:48:56.070
I'm sorry, miss, I was only...

01:48:56.739 --> 01:49:01.075
You came to steal that radio.
You were about to pick it up.

01:49:01.410 --> 01:49:02.744
I'll tell my father.

01:49:03.287 --> 01:49:05.622
He will have you punished.

01:49:08.459 --> 01:49:11.628
I was only going to look at it.
I swear.

01:49:12.004 --> 01:49:16.174
I've passed by here so often.
I've never seen a radio,

01:49:16.884 --> 01:49:18.968
so small, so cunning.

01:49:19.511 --> 01:49:22.639
I couldn't believe it really worked.
I just...

01:49:23.098 --> 01:49:24.807
Liar! You wanted to steal it.

01:49:25.434 --> 01:49:27.227
I knew by the look on your face.

01:49:28.562 --> 01:49:32.690
You must believe me.
I wouldn't take your radio.

01:49:33.359 --> 01:49:36.486
Yes, you would. It cost 70 marks.

01:49:36.904 --> 01:49:40.156
You'd listen to music in the cellar.
You're a dirty Polack!

01:49:40.574 --> 01:49:44.369
Mother says Polacks are worse thieves
than Gypsies

01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:46.204
and dirtier, too.

01:49:47.164 --> 01:49:48.331
You stink!

01:50:03.847 --> 01:50:05.014
Wake up.

01:50:06.350 --> 01:50:08.393
You fainted.

01:50:18.904 --> 01:50:22.282
Breathe deeply,
the cold air will revive you.

01:50:26.036 --> 01:50:30.039
Keep your head flat
to get the flow of blood back.

01:50:30.916 --> 01:50:34.877
The first-aid manual says
a smack will help.

01:50:38.215 --> 01:50:40.842
Sit erect and lean against the bed.

01:50:44.930 --> 01:50:47.724
I'll say one thing,
you're very pretty.

01:50:48.100 --> 01:50:50.143
My mother said you must be Swedish.

01:50:57.568 --> 01:51:01.612
Tell me, what's that design
on your dress?

01:51:02.364 --> 01:51:04.407
My swimming championship badge.

01:51:04.867 --> 01:51:07.577
I was class champion. I was only 8.

01:51:08.746 --> 01:51:09.954
Where was that, Emmi?

01:51:10.581 --> 01:51:13.541
In Dachau.
Dachau was so much nicer than Auschwitz.

01:51:14.043 --> 01:51:18.338
We had a wonderful heated pool
only for officers' children.

01:51:19.006 --> 01:51:20.506
I'll show you my album.

01:51:35.105 --> 01:51:36.939
This is me as a baby.

01:51:38.984 --> 01:51:41.611
This is me receiving the medal.

01:51:42.988 --> 01:51:45.531
This is the pool in Dachau.

01:51:46.909 --> 01:51:48.910
This is me with my mommy.

01:51:52.247 --> 01:51:53.790
This is also me

01:51:54.083 --> 01:51:55.708
with my daddy.

01:51:58.295 --> 01:51:59.796
Emmi?

01:52:00.297 --> 01:52:02.465
I'm getting undressed.

01:52:03.258 --> 01:52:05.885
Perhaps we'll go swimming together tomorrow.

01:52:05.637 --> 01:52:07.054
Great, Daddy.

01:52:08.514 --> 01:52:10.890
- Good night, Emmi.
- Good night, Daddy.

01:52:16.772 --> 01:52:22.819
<i>I had failed with the radio,
just as I had failed so many times in my life.</i>

01:52:24.405 --> 01:52:29.492
But that night,
I kept repeating to myself,

01:52:31.662 --> 01:52:35.164
"I have saved my son.
I have saved my son.

01:52:36.375 --> 01:52:38.751
"Tomorrow I can see him!

01:52:40.963 --> 01:52:43.423
"And I can tell him goodbye.

01:52:44.091 --> 01:52:46.676
"And he will have been saved."

01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:50.430
Oh, my God, I had such happiness that night!

01:52:52.141 --> 01:52:53.850
Such hope.

01:52:56.353 --> 01:52:59.939
<i>But Hoess did not keep his word.</i>

01:53:03.068 --> 01:53:07.363
<i>I never did know what happened
to my little boy.</i>

01:53:14.955 --> 01:53:17.248
So, you know, that's why I didn't want

01:53:18.959 --> 01:53:21.002
to live no more.

01:53:29.303 --> 01:53:31.387
Till Nathan came

01:53:32.306 --> 01:53:35.057
and he made me live for him.

01:53:47.613 --> 01:53:49.906
Live for me, Sophie.

01:53:50.782 --> 01:53:52.241
Live for me.

01:53:55.954 --> 01:54:00.583
Oh, my God!
What have we done to you?

01:54:57.766 --> 01:54:59.267
Morris, come here!

01:55:00.477 --> 01:55:01.769
Stingo!

01:55:01.853 --> 01:55:04.647
Nathan, put down the chair!
This is no time...

01:55:05.732 --> 01:55:06.774
Put down the chair!

01:55:06.858 --> 01:55:08.025
Put down the chair.

01:55:24.459 --> 01:55:25.876
Stingo!

01:55:26.211 --> 01:55:27.753
Oh, a phone call.

01:55:28.171 --> 01:55:30.965
It's Dr. Landau, Nathan's brother.

01:55:31.049 --> 01:55:33.843
All right. Thank you.

01:55:37.097 --> 01:55:38.723
Yeah, hello.

01:55:38.807 --> 01:55:40.933
<i>Hello, this is Larry,
Nathan's brother.</i>

01:55:41.018 --> 01:55:42.101
Yes, Larry!

01:55:42.185 --> 01:55:45.396
<i>Nathan's talked about you a good deal.
I know you're good friends.</i>

01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:48.065
He's talked about you a great deal.

01:55:48.191 --> 01:55:52.278
<i>And I wonder if it would be possible
for us to arrange a meeting.</i>

01:55:52.362 --> 01:55:54.947
Sure, yeah.
Just tell me when and where.

01:55:56.199 --> 01:55:58.784
My brother thinks the world of you.

01:56:00.370 --> 01:56:02.872
I've never met anybody
more brilliant than Nathan.

01:56:04.207 --> 01:56:06.626
Such a breadth of knowledge.

01:56:06.710 --> 01:56:07.710
You're right.

01:56:08.712 --> 01:56:12.798
He is convinced you're going to be
a major writer,

01:56:12.883 --> 01:56:14.342
something he once dreamed of being.

01:56:14.426 --> 01:56:15.926
Now, please, sit down.

01:56:16.386 --> 01:56:19.055
Seems to me, he's got the talent
of anything he chooses.

01:56:19.139 --> 01:56:23.643
He's told you and Sophie
that he's a research biologist.

01:56:28.023 --> 01:56:29.899
At Pfizer.

01:56:37.949 --> 01:56:42.453
This biologist business
is my brother's masquerade.

01:56:42.913 --> 01:56:46.916
He has no degree of any kind.
All that is a simple fabrication.

01:56:50.045 --> 01:56:53.172
The truth is he's quite mad.

01:56:56.843 --> 01:56:58.344
Christ.

01:56:58.428 --> 01:57:00.012
One of those conditions where

01:57:00.097 --> 01:57:03.724
weeks, months, even years go by
without manifestations and then pow.

01:57:04.801 --> 01:57:08.562
He has a job at Pfizer
in the company library.

01:57:08.647 --> 01:57:10.231
An undemanding sinecure I got for him

01:57:10.315 --> 01:57:13.150
where he can do a lot of reading
without bothering anyone,

01:57:13.235 --> 01:57:15.027
and occasionally he does a little research

01:57:15.112 --> 01:57:17.613
for one of the legitimate biologists
on the staff.

01:57:19.116 --> 01:57:22.493
I'm not sure Nathan would forgive me
if he knew that I told you.

01:57:22.577 --> 01:57:26.163
He made me swear never to tell Sophie.
She knows nothing.

01:57:28.375 --> 01:57:31.919
The cruelest joke is that he was born
the perfect child.

01:57:32.421 --> 01:57:34.422
He excelled in everything.

01:57:34.798 --> 01:57:38.759
Even Nathan's teachers would speculate
on what Nathan would achieve.

01:57:39.344 --> 01:57:41.637
See, he was the kind of child

01:57:43.432 --> 01:57:46.100
everyone prepares to take the credit for.

01:57:47.519 --> 01:57:49.395
When he was 10,

01:57:49.479 --> 01:57:54.275
we were told that the child genius
was a paranoid schizophrenic.

01:57:55.986 --> 01:57:59.155
From then on, the only schools
he attended were

01:58:00.699 --> 01:58:02.575
expensive funny farms.

01:58:06.329 --> 01:58:07.830
What can I do?

01:58:09.791 --> 01:58:14.420
If he could stay off the drugs,
he might have a chance.

01:58:15.997 --> 01:58:17.923
Drugs? What is he on?

01:58:18.925 --> 01:58:20.426
Benzedrine, cocaine.

01:58:21.428 --> 01:58:22.553
You didn't know?

01:58:22.637 --> 01:58:24.138
No, I did not.

01:58:25.849 --> 01:58:28.267
I don't want it to sound
like I'm asking you to spy,

01:58:28.351 --> 01:58:31.395
but if you could simply keep tabs on him

01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:33.898
and report back to me by phone
from time to time,

01:58:33.982 --> 01:58:36.525
letting me know how he's getting on.

01:58:40.071 --> 01:58:42.490
I'm sorry to have to involve you
in this way.

01:58:44.743 --> 01:58:46.952
I don't think you understand.

01:58:48.538 --> 01:58:50.372
I love them both.

01:58:53.418 --> 01:58:55.377
They're friends of mine.

01:59:21.613 --> 01:59:23.113
Good morning, Mr. Stingo.

01:59:23.281 --> 01:59:25.324
We were afraid something terrible
might have befallen you

01:59:25.408 --> 01:59:28.077
on your way back to the pink plantation.

01:59:28.161 --> 01:59:31.705
Miss Sophie was all for having me
institute a search.

01:59:35.744 --> 01:59:37.586
Miss Sophie, you indeed look ravishing.

01:59:37.671 --> 01:59:39.213
Thank you very much.

01:59:40.966 --> 01:59:43.926
So, how are you all,
you are doing this evening?

01:59:45.762 --> 01:59:47.263
Come, darling.

01:59:48.348 --> 01:59:52.351
This was Nathan's idea
to surprise you with a Southern evening.

01:59:52.435 --> 01:59:55.104
Your book has really whet my appetite
to know about the South.

01:59:55.188 --> 01:59:57.273
Tell him about the trip, too.

01:59:57.732 --> 02:00:01.902
Yes, Miss Sophie and I
have been discussing the possibility

02:00:02.487 --> 02:00:05.865
of taking a tour of your
beloved Dixie in October.

02:00:05.949 --> 02:00:07.825
- And I've been thinking...
- Yeah.

02:00:07.909 --> 02:00:09.285
If it's all right with Miss Sophie...

02:00:09.369 --> 02:00:10.369
Sure.

02:00:11.788 --> 02:00:14.790
I was thinking maybe we could make it
a wedding trip

02:00:16.585 --> 02:00:19.962
and have you join us
not just as our best friend,

02:00:21.381 --> 02:00:23.048
but as my best man.

02:00:46.990 --> 02:00:48.908
I have the honor

02:00:50.994 --> 02:00:55.497
to request your hand in marriage.

02:00:59.961 --> 02:01:03.047
To have and to hold,

02:01:05.216 --> 02:01:07.176
from this day forth,

02:01:09.220 --> 02:01:11.513
till death us do part.

02:01:18.313 --> 02:01:19.813
With this ring,

02:01:21.274 --> 02:01:23.192
I betroth myself to you.

02:01:48.385 --> 02:01:53.597
I believe it's traditional for the groom
to give a gift to the best man.

02:02:03.984 --> 02:02:06.485
I told Nathan that you would have to

02:02:06.569 --> 02:02:10.239
put that book away for a while
to make money,

02:02:10.323 --> 02:02:13.242
and that made him very sad.

02:02:21.001 --> 02:02:23.544
Nathan, I can't possibly accept this.

02:02:23.837 --> 02:02:26.463
Stingo, don't reject it.

02:02:28.299 --> 02:02:30.300
Don't waste your talent.

02:02:34.597 --> 02:02:36.890
I don't know how to thank you.

02:02:37.308 --> 02:02:41.186
Would the future Mrs. Landau care to give me
the honor of this dance?

02:03:23.104 --> 02:03:25.397
Isn't it thrilling about Nathan?

02:03:26.816 --> 02:03:28.317
What do you mean?

02:03:29.319 --> 02:03:30.819
You don't know?

02:03:32.572 --> 02:03:35.074
It's supposed to be a secret.

02:03:36.326 --> 02:03:40.996
He confided in me that he and his team

02:03:41.081 --> 02:03:43.916
discovered a cure for polio

02:03:45.001 --> 02:03:46.919
in my house.

02:03:48.296 --> 02:03:51.298
If only my Saul could have lived
to see the day.

02:03:51.382 --> 02:03:53.425
The car is ready, Mrs. Zimmerman.

02:03:53.510 --> 02:03:54.760
Yeah. I'll be down.

02:03:54.844 --> 02:03:57.179
What did Nathan say when he saw you?

02:03:58.515 --> 02:04:00.015
I haven't seen him.

02:04:00.925 --> 02:04:03.268
Well, he and Sophie left here
a couple hours ago.

02:04:03.353 --> 02:04:05.437
He said something about looking for you

02:04:05.522 --> 02:04:08.023
and straightening out things with you
once and for all.

02:04:08.108 --> 02:04:09.650
Wait, what?

02:04:09.734 --> 02:04:11.276
I guess you just missed them.

02:04:11.361 --> 02:04:14.113
Sophie kept telling him
he was imagining things,

02:04:14.197 --> 02:04:17.157
trying to soothe him the way she does
when he gets like that.

02:04:17.242 --> 02:04:20.536
God knows what mashugana idea
was going through his mind this time.

02:04:20.620 --> 02:04:22.204
I told you to watch out.

02:04:22.330 --> 02:04:25.542
Next time you'll listen to Morris Fink?

02:04:26.626 --> 02:04:28.877
My God, it's like I'm the dog catcher
for the whole thing.

02:04:28.962 --> 02:04:30.546
Morris, do you know where he is now?

02:04:30.630 --> 02:04:32.172
No, I don't know.

02:04:56.739 --> 02:04:58.282
Hello.

02:04:58.366 --> 02:05:00.409
<i>God damn you to hell forever.<i></i></i>

02:05:01.411 --> 02:05:02.586
Nathan?

02:05:10.170 --> 02:05:11.378
Are you all right?

02:05:11.462 --> 02:05:12.796
Oh, yes. I'm all right.

02:05:12.881 --> 02:05:14.423
What's wrong with your arm?

02:05:14.507 --> 02:05:16.300
He was breaking my arm.

02:05:16.384 --> 02:05:19.011
I got frightened and I ran away.

02:05:19.095 --> 02:05:23.265
He has a gun, Stingo.
I think he's going to use it.

02:05:24.809 --> 02:05:26.768
I shouldn't have left him there.

02:05:27.604 --> 02:05:28.937
We should go find...

02:05:29.647 --> 02:05:31.398
- Nathan?
- <i>Stingo.</i>

02:05:32.108 --> 02:05:34.484
<i>Now, you listen. Listen to me.</i>

02:05:34.611 --> 02:05:36.695
Is it Nathan? Nathan!

02:05:36.779 --> 02:05:37.738
<i>Oh, God!</i>

02:05:37.822 --> 02:05:41.742
Nathan! My darling, you forgive me?

02:05:41.826 --> 02:05:44.119
<i>Get off the phone, you whore!</i>

02:05:44.204 --> 02:05:46.455
You know that I love you.

02:05:47.123 --> 02:05:49.208
<i>I don't want to speak to you again!</i>

02:05:49.292 --> 02:05:51.835
Nathan, we love you very much, all right?

02:05:52.795 --> 02:05:54.671
We would do nothing to hurt you.

02:05:55.590 --> 02:05:57.382
Now, you tell us where you are.

02:05:57.467 --> 02:06:02.054
<i>God damn you to hell forever
for betraying me behind my back.</i>

02:06:02.138 --> 02:06:05.682
<i>You, whom I trust like
the best friend I ever had</i>

02:06:06.434 --> 02:06:10.771
<i>and that shit-eating grin of yours
day after day.</i>

02:06:10.855 --> 02:06:12.981
<i>Butter wouldn't melt in your mouth,
would it,</i>

02:06:13.066 --> 02:06:15.400
<i>when you gave me a piece
of your manuscript to read?</i>

02:06:15.485 --> 02:06:18.195
<i>"Gee, Nathan. Thank you so much."</i>

02:06:18.279 --> 02:06:19.696
<i>When not 15 minutes earlier,</i>

02:06:19.781 --> 02:06:22.574
<i>you'd been humping away in bed
with the woman I was going to marry.</i>

02:06:22.659 --> 02:06:24.576
<i>Marry! Marry!</i>

02:06:24.661 --> 02:06:26.578
<i>I say "was going to," past tense,</i>

02:06:26.663 --> 02:06:29.706
<i>because I'd burn in hell
before I'd marry a two-timing Polack</i>

02:06:29.791 --> 02:06:33.669
<i>who'd spread her legs for a sneaky Southern shithead,
betraying me like that.</i>

02:06:33.753 --> 02:06:36.255
Nathan, we're gonna come get you.
Where are you? All right?

02:06:36.339 --> 02:06:41.009
<i>Come and get me? No. You stay right where you are.
I'm going to come and get you.</i>

02:06:41.094 --> 02:06:42.844
<i>Both of you.</i>

02:06:42.929 --> 02:06:44.429
Jesus, Nathan!

02:06:44.514 --> 02:06:46.014
<i>Don't go away.</i>

02:06:46.140 --> 02:06:51.061
<i>You know what I'm going to do
to you two deceitful, unspeakable pigs?</i>

02:06:51.145 --> 02:06:52.205
<i>Listen!</i>

02:06:53.856 --> 02:06:55.774
<i>Now I'm coming to get you.</i>

02:06:55.858 --> 02:06:56.984
Oh, God!

02:06:57.068 --> 02:06:59.278
I called his brother's office.

02:06:59.654 --> 02:07:02.698
Larry is in Toronto,
but they're going to try and reach him.

02:07:02.782 --> 02:07:04.741
I should've stayed there.

02:07:08.371 --> 02:07:10.497
Maybe I could've helped him.

02:07:12.166 --> 02:07:14.793
He's never been this bad before.

02:07:17.588 --> 02:07:19.715
I think he could've killed us.

02:07:22.093 --> 02:07:24.136
I think he could've killed us both.

02:07:24.220 --> 02:07:26.305
I don't care that I would die.

02:07:27.598 --> 02:07:30.475
I am afraid that he will die without me.

02:07:46.576 --> 02:07:48.076
Thank you.

02:08:10.892 --> 02:08:11.933
Stingo?

02:08:14.354 --> 02:08:16.646
Where are we going?

02:08:20.026 --> 02:08:23.737
Well, I want to take you
to see the Washington sights.

02:08:24.546 --> 02:08:25.822
In the White House.

02:08:26.949 --> 02:08:28.950
Maybe get a peek at Harry Truman.

02:08:29.452 --> 02:08:30.577
Yeah.

02:08:31.579 --> 02:08:32.871
I mean,

02:08:34.832 --> 02:08:36.541
where are we going?

02:08:37.960 --> 02:08:39.753
Where are we really going?

02:08:41.506 --> 02:08:44.049
Well, I'm going to take you down
to that farm

02:08:44.133 --> 02:08:46.176
that I told you about,
in southern Virginia.

02:08:53.643 --> 02:08:55.977
I think once we get settled in there,

02:08:57.271 --> 02:08:59.064
we can drive over to Richmond,

02:08:59.148 --> 02:09:02.401
get a good phonograph,
maybe buy some records.

02:09:04.404 --> 02:09:07.614
What do you mean,
"Get settled in there"?

02:09:08.699 --> 02:09:12.702
Well, I love you very much, Sophie.

02:09:15.206 --> 02:09:19.084
And I want to marry you.

02:09:23.381 --> 02:09:26.758
I want you to live down there
on that farm with me.

02:09:28.177 --> 02:09:30.554
When I write my books there,
I want you to help me

02:09:30.638 --> 02:09:33.598
and I want you to help me raise a family

02:09:34.934 --> 02:09:39.187
because I love you very, very much.

02:09:41.357 --> 02:09:44.317
Is it too much to hope

02:09:46.821 --> 02:09:49.656
that you might love me, too?

02:09:59.959 --> 02:10:05.088
Listen, Stingo,
I'm beyond 30 years now, you know.

02:10:05.173 --> 02:10:08.467
What are you going to do
with an old Polish lady like me?

02:10:09.010 --> 02:10:12.220
Manage. I'll manage.

02:10:13.014 --> 02:10:14.806
"Old woman."

02:10:15.725 --> 02:10:17.476
Don't talk that way.

02:10:19.479 --> 02:10:21.897
You're always going to be

02:10:24.567 --> 02:10:26.067
my number one.

02:10:32.825 --> 02:10:36.536
Well, then, yes, okay.
We could go down there. Sure.

02:10:37.747 --> 02:10:40.457
We could live there for a while and then...

02:10:40.541 --> 02:10:44.211
We're not getting married
because we could decide that later, you know.

02:10:45.713 --> 02:10:49.674
Sophie, the kind of little country place

02:10:49.759 --> 02:10:52.135
I'm talking about that we'd be living in,

02:10:52.220 --> 02:10:54.638
we'd have to be married.

02:10:55.515 --> 02:10:59.100
Jesus, Sophie, these are Christians
down there, you know.

02:11:01.354 --> 02:11:04.272
Well, I don't know, I mean,

02:11:06.734 --> 02:11:10.153
getting married soon,
I've loved you a very long time.

02:11:16.285 --> 02:11:18.119
I know you're fond of me.

02:11:24.460 --> 02:11:28.296
Give us time. Just give us time.

02:11:29.590 --> 02:11:31.633
We'll be fine.

02:11:46.440 --> 02:11:49.401
It is not just the age difference, you know,

02:11:50.611 --> 02:11:52.696
between you and me, Stingo.

02:11:55.825 --> 02:12:00.495
You should have another mother
for your children.

02:12:01.956 --> 02:12:03.206
Only you.

02:12:04.041 --> 02:12:08.086
It would not be fair to your children
to have me as their mother.

02:12:10.339 --> 02:12:13.008
Sophie, they would be
the luckiest children in the world.

02:12:15.177 --> 02:12:17.929
I'm going to tell you something.

02:12:20.850 --> 02:12:25.478
I'm going to tell you something now
I have never told anybody.

02:12:30.192 --> 02:12:34.571
Never, but I need a drink,
so would you get me that first?

02:13:06.062 --> 02:13:09.230
On the day that we went

02:13:13.235 --> 02:13:17.530
to Auschwitz, it was spring, you know,

02:13:19.124 --> 02:13:21.034
and we arrived there at night.

02:13:21.118 --> 02:13:24.788
It was a warm night,
it was a beautiful night.

02:13:30.127 --> 02:13:32.295
Mommy, you're hurting me!

02:15:34.168 --> 02:15:36.044
You're so beautiful.

02:15:41.509 --> 02:15:43.551
I'd like to get you in bed.

02:15:49.558 --> 02:15:51.392
Are you a Polack?

02:15:54.230 --> 02:15:55.688
You!

02:15:58.108 --> 02:16:01.402
Are you also one of those filthy communists?

02:16:11.789 --> 02:16:13.623
I am a Pole!

02:16:13.999 --> 02:16:18.086
I was born in Krakow! I am not a Jew!
Neither are my children!

02:16:18.420 --> 02:16:20.713
They're not Jews.
They are racially pure.

02:16:20.798 --> 02:16:21.881
I'm a Christian.

02:16:22.633 --> 02:16:24.592
I'm a devout Catholic.

02:16:49.994 --> 02:16:51.369
You're not a communist?

02:16:54.290 --> 02:16:55.957
You're a believer.

02:16:56.125 --> 02:16:59.294
Yes, sir. I believe in Christ.

02:17:02.089 --> 02:17:05.967
So you believe in Christ, the Redeemer?

02:17:06.218 --> 02:17:07.302
Yes!

02:17:22.985 --> 02:17:25.028
Did he not say,

02:17:25.821 --> 02:17:28.072
"Suffer the little children

02:17:29.199 --> 02:17:31.743
"to come unto me?"

02:17:37.583 --> 02:17:40.209
You may keep one of your children.

02:17:42.922 --> 02:17:44.339
I beg your pardon?

02:17:45.341 --> 02:17:48.092
You may keep one of your children.

02:17:49.136 --> 02:17:51.137
The other one must go.

02:17:52.097 --> 02:17:54.557
You mean, I have to choose?

02:17:58.102 --> 02:18:00.813
You're a Polack not a Yid.

02:18:02.900 --> 02:18:05.735
That gives you a privilege, a choice.

02:18:08.155 --> 02:18:11.616
I can't choose! I can't choose!

02:18:11.950 --> 02:18:13.660
- Be quiet.
- I can't choose!

02:18:14.495 --> 02:18:17.914
Choose! Or I'll send them both over there!

02:18:18.582 --> 02:18:20.124
Make a choice!

02:18:20.250 --> 02:18:22.960
Don't make me choose! I can't!

02:18:23.045 --> 02:18:25.046
I'll send them both over there.

02:18:26.840 --> 02:18:28.508
Shut up! Enough!

02:18:28.968 --> 02:18:32.261
I told you to shut up!
Make a choice!

02:18:32.888 --> 02:18:35.056
Don't make me choose! I can't!

02:18:35.432 --> 02:18:37.933
- I'll send them both over there!
- I can't choose!

02:18:38.559 --> 02:18:39.977
Take both children away!

02:18:40.312 --> 02:18:41.312
Move!

02:18:42.481 --> 02:18:43.564
Take my little girl!

02:18:45.734 --> 02:18:47.567
Take my baby!

02:18:48.736 --> 02:18:51.990
Take my little girl!

02:19:21.270 --> 02:19:22.477
So.

02:19:27.401 --> 02:19:30.611
We will go to that farm tomorrow, yeah.

02:19:35.617 --> 02:19:38.161
But please, Stingo,

02:19:41.206 --> 02:19:43.790
don't talk about marriage

02:19:54.094 --> 02:19:56.054
and children.

02:20:07.316 --> 02:20:08.941
It's enough that

02:20:10.986 --> 02:20:13.196
we go down there

02:20:17.159 --> 02:20:18.534
and live

02:20:23.791 --> 02:20:25.249
for a while.

02:21:52.880 --> 02:21:56.007
<i>I was 22 and a virgin</i>

02:21:56.091 --> 02:21:58.885
<i>and was clasping in my arms at last</i>

02:21:58.969 --> 02:22:01.762
<i>the goddess of my unending fantasies.</i>

02:22:03.223 --> 02:22:05.766
<i>My lust was inexhaustible.</i>

02:22:07.477 --> 02:22:11.772
<i>Sophie's lust was both
a plunge into carnal oblivion</i>

02:22:11.857 --> 02:22:14.692
<i>and a flight from memory and grief.</i>

02:22:16.486 --> 02:22:18.779
<i>More than that, I now see,</i>

02:22:20.157 --> 02:22:23.492
<i>it was a frantic attempt
to beat back death.</i>

02:22:26.788 --> 02:22:28.623
<i>"My dearest Stingo.</i>

02:22:30.459 --> 02:22:34.503
<i>"You are such a beautiful lover.
I had to leave,</i>

02:22:34.588 --> 02:22:39.926
<i>"and forgive me for not saying goodbye,
but I must go back to Nathan.</i>

02:22:41.303 --> 02:22:44.138
<i>"Believe me, you will find
some wonderful woman</i>

02:22:44.223 --> 02:22:46.515
<i>"to make you happy on that farm.</i>

02:22:48.101 --> 02:22:52.897
<i>"But when I woke,
I was feeling so terrible</i>

02:22:54.316 --> 02:22:56.525
<i>"and in despair about Nathan.</i>

02:22:56.610 --> 02:23:00.571
<i>"By that, I mean so filled with guilt,
thoughts of death.</i>

02:23:00.656 --> 02:23:04.325
<i>"It was like ice flowing in my blood.</i>

02:23:05.160 --> 02:23:09.664
<i>"So I must be with Nathan again,
for whatever that means.</i>

02:23:11.875 --> 02:23:15.086
<i>"I may not see you again,</i>

02:23:17.172 --> 02:23:21.634
<i>"but do believe me how much knowing you
has meant to me.</i>

02:23:23.011 --> 02:23:25.888
<i>"You are a great lover, Stingo.</i>

02:23:27.516 --> 02:23:29.016
<i>"Sophie."</i>

02:23:35.190 --> 02:23:37.900
Landau. L-A-N-D-A-U.

02:23:37.985 --> 02:23:40.111
He worked in a pharmaceutical lab.

02:23:40.195 --> 02:23:43.531
I think that's how he got ahold
of the cyanide, you see.

02:23:43.615 --> 02:23:45.866
They found it next to the bed, you know.

02:23:45.951 --> 02:23:47.326
What lab, do you know?

02:23:47.411 --> 02:23:49.287
I'm not sure where it was.

02:26:04.131 --> 02:26:06.006
"Ample make this bed.

02:26:08.218 --> 02:26:10.386
"Make this bed with awe.

02:26:12.180 --> 02:26:13.431
"In it,

02:26:15.725 --> 02:26:17.768
"wait till judgment break,

02:26:19.020 --> 02:26:20.896
"excellent and fair.

"Be its mattress straight.

02:26:29.865 --> 02:26:31.740
"Be its pillow round.

"Let no sunrise yellow noise

02:26:37.998 --> 02:26:40.583
"interrupt this ground."

02:26:45.714 --> 02:26:48.924
<i>And so ended my voyage of discovery</i>

02:26:49.009 --> 02:26:51.177
<i>in a place as strange as Brooklyn.</i>

02:26:54.514 --> 02:26:58.642
<i>I let go of the rage and sorrow
for Sophie and Nathan</i>

02:26:58.727 --> 02:27:00.811
<i>and for the many others
who were but a few</i>

02:27:00.896 --> 02:27:05.858
<i>of the butchered and betrayed
and martyred children of the Earth.</i>

02:27:07.402 --> 02:27:09.778
<i>When I could finally see again,</i>

02:27:10.655 --> 02:27:15.242
<i>I saw the first rays of daylight
reflected in the murky river.</i>

02:27:17.537 --> 02:27:19.830
<i>This was not judgment day.</i>

02:27:20.582 --> 02:27:22.249
<i>Only morning.</i>

02:27:23.376 --> 02:27:27.463
<i>Morning, excellent and fair.</i>
