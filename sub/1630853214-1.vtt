WEBVTT

01:53.417 --> 01:56.417
Morning.

02:36.083 --> 02:39.333
How come you always wake
up just before my alarm goes off?

02:42.292 --> 02:45.042
I'm your real alarm clock.

02:55.917 --> 02:58.000
Can you take the morning off?

02:58.500 --> 03:02.083
No... I have a meeting this
morning that I can't miss.

03:02.125 --> 03:03.458
Come on, get up.

03:08.583 --> 03:10.875
We have our trip next week anyway.

03:11.958 --> 03:12.958
What?

03:13.583 --> 03:14.958
We are going to kenting.

03:16.042 --> 03:17.667
Next... next week?

03:18.500 --> 03:20.792
Didn't we talk about going
to kenting next week?

03:21.542 --> 03:24.542
Shit... shit...

03:26.292 --> 03:31.250
Oh... I was gonna talk
to you about that today.

03:31.292 --> 03:34.000
Barry wants me to help on a shoot.

03:34.833 --> 03:36.333
When?

03:37.708 --> 03:38.833
Next week.

03:39.292 --> 03:42.042
They don't know the date
yet. It depends on the weather.

03:46.292 --> 03:50.042
Hey, it's a German ad agency

03:51.375 --> 03:53.417
and the money's pretty good.

03:55.292 --> 03:58.917
It wasn't easy for me to book the week off.

03:58.958 --> 04:02.000
You know I only get 10
vacation days a year, right?

04:06.958 --> 04:09.958
I'm sorry...

04:10.000 --> 04:12.542
I just... kind of need this job.

04:13.083 --> 04:15.364
I haven't been getting many
work opportunities these days.

04:16.791 --> 04:18.833
When was the last time
we had a trip together?

04:19.458 --> 04:22.500
I want to relax in the fresh
air... I want to get a tan.

04:24.292 --> 04:27.167
Get a tan? ...The roof!
You can go to the roof!

04:48.208 --> 04:50.583
Kat, I'm sorry.

04:50.833 --> 04:52.833
I'm an idiot.

04:53.458 --> 04:56.000
My client base is tiny, I
have to take what I can get.

04:58.458 --> 05:01.500
I'll talk to Barry and work it out, ok?

05:06.708 --> 05:09.750
Do you wanna take the baozi
from last night for your lunch?

05:11.167 --> 05:12.458
You can have it.

05:13.333 --> 05:14.708
Thanks, babe.

06:00.833 --> 06:03.833
Doctor, I really need to understand...

06:04.083 --> 06:06.309
And I'm sure I'm speaking
for everyone listening as well...

06:06.333 --> 06:09.125
Why do you and the rest
of the medical community

06:09.167 --> 06:11.333
continue to promote
fear of the Alvin virus.

06:12.542 --> 06:14.167
Ok, so the situation is like this:

06:14.208 --> 06:16.333
Most the people believe
that the Alvin virus...

06:16.375 --> 06:18.542
Is no more serious than
a mild case of the flu.

06:18.583 --> 06:19.000
Right.

06:19.375 --> 06:22.375
But experts are terrified of
the mutation potential of Alvin

06:22.417 --> 06:25.417
for a very simple reason. Let me show you.

06:30.208 --> 06:31.208
Take a look.

06:33.208 --> 06:35.292
There are dormant protein chains in Alvin

06:35.708 --> 06:37.643
that are very clearly from
the iyssa order of viruses.

06:37.667 --> 06:41.125
That's the same order
that rabies is a part of.

06:41.167 --> 06:42.167
Doctor...

06:42.208 --> 06:42.833
Doctor!

06:42.917 --> 06:43.792
I'm worried that maybe one day...

06:43.833 --> 06:45.083
Doctor! Let me speak!

06:46.083 --> 06:46.875
I'm concerned...

06:46.917 --> 06:48.000
You said that already!

06:48.042 --> 06:49.708
And I've heard it.

06:50.292 --> 06:54.000
There have been zero deaths,
so why the scare tactics?

06:54.958 --> 06:58.917
And I find it very convenient that
Alvin just happened to show-up

06:58.958 --> 07:01.000
during an election year.

07:01.458 --> 07:02.458
I'll emphasize this again

07:03.375 --> 07:06.333
our society must take
this outbreak seriously.

07:06.542 --> 07:09.083
To politicize a virus
is a terrible mistake!

07:09.333 --> 07:12.333
Alvin continues to be a very
real threat to public health...

07:13.208 --> 07:15.125
And it doesn't care who the president is.

07:25.500 --> 07:26.500
Hey!

07:27.583 --> 07:29.167
Are you alright?

07:52.167 --> 07:53.917
You ready?

07:57.167 --> 07:58.167
Did you see that?

07:58.583 --> 07:59.583
What?

07:59.708 --> 08:02.542
Can't you put trash in the bin?

08:11.333 --> 08:13.375
Hey, Jim. Good morning!

08:14.375 --> 08:15.458
Good morning. Mr. Lin.

08:22.458 --> 08:24.167
Hey, are you alright?

08:24.792 --> 08:25.792
Huh?

08:26.333 --> 08:28.708
What's wrong? This is just a cold.

08:29.083 --> 08:30.458
You should go to the hospital.

08:31.292 --> 08:36.707
Hospital? Nah, I'm done
with waiting in hospitals.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.957
Besides, doctors always say the same thing:

08:39.167 --> 08:42.542
"Stay home, get some rest."

08:43.417 --> 08:44.737
That's not a hard thing to say...

08:45.833 --> 08:48.167
I could probably be a doctor.

08:49.167 --> 08:52.167
And all that stuff on the news...

08:52.292 --> 08:56.500
The pandemic, the virus... it's a hoax.

08:56.625 --> 08:59.917
All those low—lives that
own the media companies...

08:59.958 --> 09:03.708
Are blowing this out of proportion
to drive down stock prices.

09:04.583 --> 09:08.833
So they can buy low, and sell
high when the economy bounces back.

09:09.125 --> 09:10.125
Is that true?

09:11.583 --> 09:13.458
Sure is. Wanna bet?

09:15.500 --> 09:18.083
Well... that's what I
would do if I had the money.

09:23.042 --> 09:25.542
Anyways, I have too
much of this Thai basil.

09:31.083 --> 09:34.083
I'll give you some later.

09:34.958 --> 09:36.792
That's great. Thanks, Mr. Lin.

09:36.833 --> 09:37.875
Don't mention it.

09:38.708 --> 09:40.292
Kat, what time is it?

09:41.083 --> 09:42.458
Almost 8:30.

09:46.958 --> 09:47.958
Mr. Lin.

09:51.083 --> 09:53.208
Bye bye.

10:04.708 --> 10:05.708
Bye bye.

11:38.583 --> 11:40.000
I'm sorry you had to see that.

11:41.125 --> 11:42.583
I shouldn't have slowed down.

11:43.083 --> 11:44.167
Sorry.

11:44.333 --> 11:45.792
It's alright.

11:51.833 --> 11:54.542
I'll make dinner tonight, ok?

11:54.667 --> 11:56.458
Yay! What are you making?

11:57.542 --> 12:02.875
Dunno yet... something with Thai basil.

12:02.917 --> 12:05.083
I promise you'll love it.

12:05.542 --> 12:06.542
Cool

12:12.333 --> 12:13.333
See you later.

12:59.083 --> 13:00.203
What would you like to have?

13:00.333 --> 13:01.750
Hmm...

13:01.792 --> 13:05.958
I want... an egg roll with fried pork

13:06.292 --> 13:06.792
got it.

13:06.833 --> 13:07.833
Ok.

13:08.167 --> 13:10.542
And a large cup of milk tea.

13:10.833 --> 13:12.143
So, pork egg roll, and
a large milk tea, right?

13:12.167 --> 13:13.167
Right.

13:13.208 --> 13:13.750
For here or to go?

13:13.792 --> 13:14.250
For here.

13:14.417 --> 13:14.917
Ok.

13:15.333 --> 13:16.333
Thanks.

13:16.583 --> 13:17.458
Hey, good morning.

13:17.500 --> 13:18.500
Good morning.

13:18.542 --> 13:19.542
You want the usual?

13:19.833 --> 13:21.458
No, I just ate...

13:21.833 --> 13:24.583
I'm just gonna have a medium black coffee

13:24.625 --> 13:25.250
to go.

13:25.458 --> 13:25.958
Thanks.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.375
You got it. I just need
to fill this lady's order.

13:28.417 --> 13:29.417
Ok

14:08.042 --> 14:11.583
The pandemic is affecting
the real estate market...

14:11.958 --> 14:14.917
Properties are cheaper
than they were last year.

14:56.458 --> 14:57.458
Granny.

14:59.042 --> 15:00.208
Are you alright?

15:30.917 --> 15:32.000
Handsome boy!

16:01.208 --> 16:03.042
That bitch came outta nowhere!

17:31.583 --> 17:33.375
Civil emergency.

17:33.417 --> 17:35.792
Stay tuned for urgent information.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
Good morning everyone.

18:08.833 --> 18:11.417
Pay attention to the following message.

18:12.375 --> 18:14.833
There are some new rules for everyone.

18:16.083 --> 18:20.708
All men must report to the district office.

18:22.667 --> 18:25.708
I'll cut all your dicks off
and feed them to stray dogs.

18:27.208 --> 18:30.167
And for the ladies...

18:31.667 --> 18:34.458
They'll be fucked by dogs in the street.

18:36.625 --> 18:39.625
Is that clear? This is your new life...

18:40.875 --> 18:44.000
"Baby, are you alright?"

18:44.292 --> 18:47.000
”Where are you right now?"

19:01.333 --> 19:04.333
“People are going
crazy. Hurting each other.”

19:08.417 --> 19:12.583
"Don't come back here... I'll go to you."

19:24.458 --> 19:25.667
Mr. Lin?

19:25.708 --> 19:26.708
What the fuck?

19:31.583 --> 19:32.917
Hi neighbor!

19:33.583 --> 19:35.583
Nice morning isn't it?

20:07.250 --> 20:08.458
Don't worry...

20:09.333 --> 20:10.583
About your girl...

20:11.958 --> 20:14.958
I'll finger her for you.

23:30.875 --> 23:32.333
Good morning

23:32.458 --> 23:33.458
good morning

23:37.833 --> 23:39.458
what are you reading?

23:41.208 --> 23:43.333
Just... just a novel.

23:47.458 --> 23:48.978
I can see that you're focused on that.

23:50.625 --> 23:54.208
No one reads books on the train anymore

23:54.458 --> 23:57.833
they all focus on their phones.

23:58.292 --> 23:59.292
Yeah...

23:59.458 --> 24:00.458
True.

24:06.083 --> 24:08.083
What's it about?

24:09.542 --> 24:12.542
Sir, I appreciate you trying to be friendly

24:12.583 --> 24:15.583
but I really just want to
focus on my book right now.

24:16.583 --> 24:17.601
Sure... sure... of course...

24:17.625 --> 24:21.083
You would like to
focus on reading. I get it.

24:37.667 --> 24:38.667
Hey...

24:42.792 --> 24:46.292
I actually see you on
the train pretty often...

24:48.292 --> 24:49.458
So...

24:50.167 --> 24:51.917
I thought that today...

24:52.958 --> 24:56.708
I'd... finally tell you.

24:57.292 --> 24:58.292
That...

24:59.083 --> 25:03.458
I think you are... really beautiful.

25:04.208 --> 25:05.208
Thanks.

25:24.167 --> 25:25.917
Hey, where do you work?

25:26.458 --> 25:27.667
Are you finished?

25:29.542 --> 25:32.292
I already asked you to leave me alone.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.583
Do you want me to charge
you with sexual harassment?

25:38.208 --> 25:40.833
I'm going to bring this to
police if you don't shut up.

25:53.208 --> 25:55.708
What's wrong with people nowadays?

25:57.083 --> 26:01.458
Having a conversation on
the train, is this a crime now?

26:05.708 --> 26:08.833
I'm only trying to
communicate, to be social

26:09.000 --> 26:10.708
and now I'm accused for sexual harassment?

26:20.458 --> 26:23.458
I was polite too!

26:24.292 --> 26:26.125
And I gave compliments!

26:26.167 --> 26:29.917
Sexual harassment?

26:30.083 --> 26:31.500
Women these days are all the same.

26:32.792 --> 26:35.125
Thinking they can be rude
just because they're pretty.

26:35.500 --> 26:37.542
What has happened to this country?

26:38.792 --> 26:40.333
I deserve better than this.

26:51.958 --> 26:53.292
Please take my seat.

26:54.292 --> 26:55.292
Thank you.

28:24.708 --> 28:26.083
What's happening?

29:33.917 --> 29:36.917
Did I break the record?
Did I break the record?

29:43.458 --> 29:46.458
Why? Why is he doing this?

29:46.958 --> 29:49.958
It's over now. They caught him.

29:51.042 --> 29:53.125
It's over.

30:57.583 --> 31:00.833
Shut up, you filthy cunt!

31:58.042 --> 32:01.042
"Jim: Don't come back. I'll go to you."

33:57.708 --> 33:59.208
I feel...

34:00.917 --> 34:02.292
I can't breathe.

34:02.542 --> 34:04.458
You should go, leave me.

34:05.583 --> 34:08.583
We can't stop here! Definitely not!

34:12.208 --> 34:14.083
It's alright.

34:15.333 --> 34:16.958
What's your name?

34:19.333 --> 34:21.417
I'm Molly.

34:21.542 --> 34:24.542
Molly... I'm Kat.

34:25.167 --> 34:26.333
Listen to me

34:26.958 --> 34:30.042
we are very close to the
exit. Let's keep moving.

34:30.458 --> 34:32.125
Once we're out. We'll be at the hospital.

34:32.167 --> 34:34.625
We can get your eye taken care of.

34:35.583 --> 34:36.583
Let's go!

34:37.958 --> 34:38.958
Hey, lady!

34:40.583 --> 34:41.958
Where are you running to?

34:58.250 --> 34:59.750
There you are.

35:02.542 --> 35:05.542
Oh, there is another dirty slut.

35:07.458 --> 35:08.458
Stand up!

35:22.500 --> 35:24.792
Wasn't that the fat cunt
on the train? Wait for me!

35:34.333 --> 35:36.125
What the fuck?

35:36.333 --> 35:37.583
Are you blind?

35:41.917 --> 35:42.917
Oh shit!

35:42.958 --> 35:44.458
You are blind!

35:44.958 --> 35:46.167
What happened to her?

35:46.458 --> 35:47.042
Help us!

35:47.083 --> 35:47.625
What?

35:47.667 --> 35:48.250
Help us!

35:48.292 --> 35:49.292
What do you mean?

35:49.583 --> 35:50.125
What?

35:50.167 --> 35:51.917
He wants to kill us! Please help us!

35:52.417 --> 35:52.792
Who?

35:52.833 --> 35:53.833
Help us!

36:08.833 --> 36:11.583
Hey motherfucker! Did you hurt these women?

36:11.875 --> 36:14.333
Let's see how tough you
are with me, old bastard!

36:18.042 --> 36:19.042
Motherfucker!

37:12.708 --> 37:13.708
Fuck!

37:18.958 --> 37:21.417
Molly please... stand up!

37:21.458 --> 37:22.958
Don't give up!

37:26.500 --> 37:27.500
Hey!

37:30.833 --> 37:32.042
Help us!

37:33.083 --> 37:34.083
Hey!

37:34.458 --> 37:35.667
Help us!

37:38.292 --> 37:40.667
I've never had a threesome before!

37:51.583 --> 37:53.042
I haven't been this hard in years...

37:54.542 --> 37:56.750
You girls are real hot sluts!

38:16.458 --> 38:17.738
What the fuck is wrong with you?

38:17.958 --> 38:19.708
Can't you see this woman is hurt?

38:19.833 --> 38:21.667
Why didn't you help us?

38:28.833 --> 38:30.833
What's wrong with her? Is she crazy too?

38:31.167 --> 38:32.207
Which way to the hospital?

38:34.875 --> 38:36.583
The police told me to close the exit.

38:36.625 --> 38:38.583
I saw you two, but I didn't know...

38:38.625 --> 38:40.476
I... I thought you were
crazy like the other ones.

38:40.500 --> 38:42.042
Alright! Alright!

38:42.083 --> 38:43.708
Which way to the hospital?

38:45.708 --> 38:46.708
Are you ok?

38:46.792 --> 38:48.083
Can you walk?

38:48.250 --> 38:49.250
I can.

38:54.542 --> 38:56.042
I'll see you later

39:01.375 --> 39:02.375
Let's go!

39:38.125 --> 39:41.125
I don't know who's out there right now.

39:41.917 --> 39:43.792
But if anyone is listening to this

39:43.833 --> 39:47.083
it seems like there's a real,
life—threatening crisis happening.

39:47.875 --> 39:50.750
All I know right now is what I'm
seeing from my online contacts...

39:51.250 --> 39:53.375
The city is experiencing
an outbreak of civil unrest.

39:54.667 --> 39:58.625
Whether it be some kind
of organized terrorist attack

40:00.208 --> 40:03.375
or some sort of hallucinatory
drugs in the air or in the water...

40:03.417 --> 40:05.750
Or... or whatever.

40:09.917 --> 40:12.437
There are hostile people in
the streets... all over the place...

40:13.167 --> 40:16.750
And they seems to be going
on a homicidal rampage.

40:17.167 --> 40:19.247
I don't know how the cops
are dealing with this shit.

40:19.500 --> 40:20.500
I just hope...

40:21.458 --> 40:22.625
It's with their guns.

40:24.417 --> 40:26.017
And this is the really fucked up part...

40:27.458 --> 40:28.458
Furthermore...

40:29.458 --> 40:31.698
There has been many reports
of sexual violence as well...

40:32.667 --> 40:34.827
Directed toward both women...
And men... young and old.

40:35.833 --> 40:38.833
It's hard for me to believe
what's going on out there...

40:41.583 --> 40:42.583
No matter what happens,

40:43.458 --> 40:44.750
I will keep broadcasting

41:25.125 --> 41:28.500
If you encounter anyone who
is behaving in an unusual way

41:29.250 --> 41:30.650
you should take it really seriously

41:31.125 --> 41:33.205
take whatever means are
necessary to protect yourself

41:33.417 --> 41:34.625
it's not just strangers.

41:36.042 --> 41:38.125
Your own family members
may attempt to hurt you too.

43:09.750 --> 43:12.750
Shit...

43:48.500 --> 43:51.958
"Don't come back. I'll go to you"

44:52.333 --> 44:53.667
Please... please stop...

44:54.083 --> 44:56.375
Please... please stop...

44:56.417 --> 44:58.333
I'll do anything.

45:05.167 --> 45:06.167
Hey!

45:06.667 --> 45:07.375
Hey!

45:07.458 --> 45:08.458
Wake up!

45:09.333 --> 45:11.059
Fuck! I told you don't hit
him in the head anymore!

45:11.083 --> 45:13.292
If he's unconscious, this won't be as fun?

45:15.583 --> 45:16.917
I have an idea!

45:23.750 --> 45:25.310
Let's do another round of "nutcracker"!

45:33.958 --> 45:34.917
Ready...

45:34.958 --> 45:37.000
1.2.3!

45:45.458 --> 45:46.458
Take off his undennear.

46:00.042 --> 46:01.208
You wanna fuck him?

46:17.958 --> 46:20.167
Get the fuck out of
here, you little bastards!

46:21.875 --> 46:22.875
Fuck!

46:54.000 --> 46:55.250
Why'd you stop them?

46:56.625 --> 46:57.958
I was about to shoot my load.

47:16.417 --> 47:18.018
Don't leave! Stick around!
Let's have some fun!

47:18.042 --> 47:19.601
Where are you going?
You think you got rid of us?

47:19.625 --> 47:20.792
Don't leave!

47:23.208 --> 47:24.208
It will be fun!

47:29.500 --> 47:31.083
Civil emergency.

47:31.125 --> 47:33.125
Stay tuned for urgent information.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.083
That's bullshit...

47:38.083 --> 47:41.083
Look, some areas are in big trouble...

47:41.917 --> 47:42.917
Open up!

47:44.667 --> 47:46.333
She's hurt! Open up!

47:46.875 --> 47:48.250
Ok, open the door.

47:54.083 --> 47:55.583
Be careful! Are you alright?

47:56.708 --> 47:58.458
Sir, excuse me!

47:59.458 --> 48:00.958
Can we have a nurse over here?

48:15.000 --> 48:16.667
Let's make a space for the patient.

48:29.042 --> 48:30.917
The er has been closed.

48:31.542 --> 48:33.083
You'll have to stay here for now.

48:33.667 --> 48:34.667
Why?

48:35.917 --> 48:37.583
It got overrun...

48:38.458 --> 48:40.018
The police station is just a block away

48:40.542 --> 48:43.208
we were able to react pretty quickly

48:44.458 --> 48:45.625
some motherfucker...

48:46.708 --> 48:49.667
Set a little girl on fire...

48:51.167 --> 48:52.167
It was...

48:56.208 --> 48:58.125
Put pressure on this.

49:05.583 --> 49:06.643
You likely have a concussion.

49:06.667 --> 49:08.458
You'll need to have a ct scan.

49:11.833 --> 49:14.875
Here. Watch your step. Ok. Sit down.

49:21.458 --> 49:23.958
Hey! What about me?

49:27.625 --> 49:28.958
It's not broken. You'll be fine.

49:39.458 --> 49:41.208
Miss, you can't come with us.

49:45.708 --> 49:47.468
Miss, let's get treament
for you first, okay?

49:51.625 --> 49:53.125
Give us some time.

50:21.125 --> 50:24.125
Thank you for getting me out of there...

50:27.833 --> 50:30.833
Thank you for saving my life...

50:33.250 --> 50:36.250
I won't forget it.

50:51.125 --> 50:54.125
It's okay. It's okay.

50:56.292 --> 50:57.292
Molly...

50:59.708 --> 51:02.708
Take care of yourself.

51:17.250 --> 51:20.208
You're being such a drama queen.

51:21.208 --> 51:22.208
Let's go.

51:37.750 --> 51:40.917
Stay tuned for urgent information.

52:02.000 --> 52:03.083
Hey

52:03.958 --> 52:05.625
may I use your phone?

52:06.875 --> 52:09.250
Oh, ok.

52:09.500 --> 52:11.125
Thank you.

52:12.500 --> 52:14.208
Unlock it.

52:41.083 --> 52:42.875
At ease!

52:43.417 --> 52:45.833
Good morning ladies and gentlemen.

52:47.000 --> 52:50.750
It's 11:08 am.

52:52.333 --> 52:54.000
We are broadcasting to you from

52:54.042 --> 52:56.162
the central command room
at the department of defense.

52:56.542 --> 52:58.583
The current situation is very serious

52:59.125 --> 53:00.583
we've limited press involvement

53:01.125 --> 53:02.208
hey! What are you doing?

53:02.250 --> 53:03.375
Signing into the line app.

53:03.583 --> 53:05.333
I thought you needed to make a call.

53:05.375 --> 53:07.750
Yeah. On line. Who memorizes phone numbers?

53:07.792 --> 53:09.000
I do. Is that hard for you?

53:09.042 --> 53:10.042
Shut up!

53:10.500 --> 53:12.740
You almost got me raped
and killed. I'm using this phone!

53:13.875 --> 53:15.958
But, we have already arranged

53:16.000 --> 53:20.458
to take reinforcements from
areas with a low infection rate

53:21.375 --> 53:24.875
now I present our president, guo—rong xie.

53:39.792 --> 53:41.542
Good morning everyone.

53:42.625 --> 53:45.875
I'd like to apologize to you all

53:47.083 --> 53:49.283
for our lack of punctuality in
making this announcement.

53:50.833 --> 53:53.708
Since the first reports of
this disturbance came in

53:54.875 --> 53:59.250
our administration has
been working tirelessly.

54:00.958 --> 54:01.958
At this time

54:02.542 --> 54:04.351
the nation's scientific
community has not been able to

54:04.375 --> 54:06.792
explain the cause of these
random acts of violence.

54:09.000 --> 54:10.720
But we know this is not a hostile invasion.

54:11.542 --> 54:14.667
It's not a chemical weapon nor
population destabilizing agent...

54:16.125 --> 54:18.708
Many of you may be having
these kinds of cinematic theories.

54:19.625 --> 54:21.125
But there is currently no evidence...

54:21.167 --> 54:23.567
To make any conclusion about
the cause of this phenomenon.

54:24.750 --> 54:27.542
But the critical factor is
how we confront this threat...

54:27.583 --> 54:31.250
And we are confronting
it swiftly and efficiently.

54:31.958 --> 54:33.393
Since the beginning of time, mankind has...

54:33.417 --> 54:34.708
What the fuck is this?

54:34.750 --> 54:35.875
A history lesson?

54:37.333 --> 54:40.667
Although there is no
evidence that the Alvin virus

54:41.375 --> 54:43.500
is responsible for the current disturbances

54:44.250 --> 54:46.625
it should not be ruled
out as a possibility.

54:47.458 --> 54:48.875
We must work together

54:49.708 --> 54:53.542
this is the biggest challenge
in the history of our country.

54:54.500 --> 54:55.792
I promise you all

54:56.500 --> 54:58.000
we will prevail!

54:59.208 --> 55:00.208
Thank you.

55:07.125 --> 55:09.750
As president xie has outlined

55:11.125 --> 55:15.125
we are likely dealing
with a contagious disease

55:16.125 --> 55:18.333
that essentially

55:18.375 --> 55:20.750
transforms normal people

55:21.792 --> 55:24.708
into homicidal sadistic maniacs.

55:27.042 --> 55:28.833
According to our big data resources

55:30.125 --> 55:35.500
estimates of nation—wide infection
are between 15 to 20 percent.

55:38.083 --> 55:40.917
Let me do the arithmetic for you...

55:40.958 --> 55:46.917
That's 4.5 million
infected people and rising.

55:48.083 --> 55:50.500
These 4.5 million infected people...

55:51.458 --> 55:54.458
Are out there in the streets right now.

55:55.625 --> 56:00.042
Murder, rape and torture...

56:01.292 --> 56:04.458
Is only the beginning of what
these people are capable of.

56:06.375 --> 56:08.542
We must come together as citizens...

56:09.708 --> 56:12.708
And follow the plan developed by
the ministry of homeland security.

56:13.458 --> 56:16.125
As president xie has previously stated:

56:16.167 --> 56:17.417
Full transparency...

56:18.708 --> 56:20.958
Will serve best in
accomplishing our goals.

57:15.083 --> 57:16.750
What the fuck do we do now?

57:17.417 --> 57:18.625
Just shut up, will you?

57:19.500 --> 57:21.333
You have a big mouth for such a little man!

57:21.375 --> 57:22.708
You have a problem, motherfucker?

57:22.875 --> 57:23.750
I didn't vote for that bastard!

57:23.792 --> 57:24.583
You're a coward, aren't you?

57:24.625 --> 57:25.208
What the fuck did you say?

57:25.375 --> 57:26.375
I'll teach you!

57:27.875 --> 57:28.417
Don't fight here!

57:28.833 --> 57:29.833
Hey!

57:30.083 --> 57:31.083
Get out of my way!

57:33.583 --> 57:34.583
What the fuck?

57:37.750 --> 57:38.750
What the fuck?

57:44.958 --> 57:46.417
Everyone back off!

57:51.333 --> 57:53.625
Give me my phone!

57:55.792 --> 57:56.912
Everyone back off! Get back!

58:02.208 --> 58:03.208
Everyone back off!

58:35.833 --> 58:38.292
You fucking cunt, cock-sucking
whore! Give me my phone!

59:51.875 --> 59:52.875
Hey...

59:57.375 --> 59:59.292
I remember you.

01:00:06.333 --> 01:00:08.750
Where's your pretty friend?

01:00:25.625 --> 01:00:27.125
You know what?

01:00:29.833 --> 01:00:32.542
Oh boy...

01:00:33.667 --> 01:00:36.333
I'm going to have a lot of fun with you.

01:00:39.875 --> 01:00:41.250
No, no!

01:00:44.625 --> 01:00:48.125
No... no...

01:02:05.292 --> 01:02:08.000
"Kat: I lost my phone."

01:02:08.042 --> 01:02:10.333
"I'm at ntu hospital."

01:02:10.375 --> 01:02:13.167
"I'm not hurt."

01:02:32.875 --> 01:02:33.875
Hello?

01:02:35.375 --> 01:02:37.917
Are you ok? Where are you? What's going on?

01:02:40.833 --> 01:02:43.292
Kat, are you ok?

01:02:43.333 --> 01:02:45.542
I'm on my way, are you alright?

01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:48.125
I'm not hurt. I'm at ntu hospital.

01:02:48.333 --> 01:02:51.417
I think the cops are dead...

01:02:52.583 --> 01:02:55.667
And there are only crazy people here now

01:02:55.708 --> 01:02:58.083
I don't know where to go.

01:02:58.208 --> 01:02:59.917
I don't know what to do...

01:02:59.958 --> 01:03:01.000
Can you help me?

01:03:01.042 --> 01:03:02.268
I really don't know what to do...

01:03:02.292 --> 01:03:02.917
I don't know...

01:03:02.958 --> 01:03:04.542
Ok, Kat, listen to me,

01:03:04.875 --> 01:03:06.708
take a deep breath... try to calm down...

01:03:07.458 --> 01:03:09.258
You need to try to keep
it together right now.

01:03:09.333 --> 01:03:10.500
Ok...

01:03:12.208 --> 01:03:13.375
The main road is blocked now.

01:03:13.417 --> 01:03:14.809
I'm going to have to take the long way.

01:03:14.833 --> 01:03:15.958
But I'll be there. Okay?

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000
I'm so scared...

01:03:20.625 --> 01:03:22.625
Find a place to hide...
Right. Find a place to hide

01:03:22.708 --> 01:03:23.958
then you

01:03:24.333 --> 01:03:26.373
send me a line message
to let me know where you are.

01:03:26.833 --> 01:03:28.793
I can't send you a
message... this isn't my phone.

01:03:31.167 --> 01:03:32.167
Okay...

01:03:33.208 --> 01:03:34.667
You can call me. I can't call you.

01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:35.042
You can call.

01:03:35.083 --> 01:03:35.792
Ok. I got it.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.833
I'll call you again when I'm there.

01:03:38.042 --> 01:03:39.458
I'll let you know when I get there.

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:45.833
I'll be there. Okay?

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.875
Okay, okay.

01:03:48.042 --> 01:03:49.708
Just put the phone on silent.

01:03:53.250 --> 01:03:54.875
Jim

01:03:56.333 --> 01:03:57.958
I love you

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.958
I need you to know...

01:04:02.042 --> 01:04:04.167
You mean so much to me...

01:04:38.208 --> 01:04:39.833
Jim?

01:04:40.708 --> 01:04:42.750
Are you still there?

01:04:43.333 --> 01:04:46.083
Say something.
Are you still there?

01:04:46.333 --> 01:04:50.083
Are you all right?
Say something!

01:04:50.583 --> 01:04:51.583
Yes

01:04:52.875 --> 01:04:54.333
I was...

01:04:56.083 --> 01:04:57.283
I got a little light—headed...

01:04:59.208 --> 01:05:00.958
I really love you.

01:05:02.292 --> 01:05:03.542
I love you too.

01:05:05.375 --> 01:05:06.500
I'll be there soon.

01:07:40.458 --> 01:07:42.750
Little worm...

01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:45.042
I'm glad you're here.

01:08:00.958 --> 01:08:05.083
You know what? I always
had trouble making friends.

01:08:17.292 --> 01:08:18.457
I guess“.

01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:21.500
I just needed to meet the right people.

01:08:57.125 --> 01:09:00.457
This is my kiss! I'm kissing you to death!

01:09:45.792 --> 01:09:48.875
Open the door! Whore! Open the door!

01:09:52.332 --> 01:09:53.332
Hey!

01:09:57.208 --> 01:10:01.250
I'm not going to stop until
I've fucked you to death.

01:10:22.708 --> 01:10:24.250
Fuck you!!! Open it!

01:10:34.750 --> 01:10:38.583
Sorry, boys... this slut's all mine.

01:11:04.333 --> 01:11:07.458
You think that fat girl got away, huh?

01:11:09.417 --> 01:11:14.083
Her eyeball fluid is drying on
my dick right now. How about that?

01:11:16.833 --> 01:11:21.125
By the time I finished, she
was begging me to keep going.

01:11:32.417 --> 01:11:34.375
And you're next...

01:11:36.583 --> 01:11:37.583
Wait and see!

01:11:40.708 --> 01:11:42.542
A dripping cunt, hungry for my dick.

01:11:46.417 --> 01:11:50.375
I was able to fuck the fat girl
because of you. Thanks for that.

01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:28.667
You are just like me...

01:12:30.958 --> 01:12:32.542
Violent...

01:12:33.625 --> 01:12:35.833
And depraved.

01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:51.500
Are... are you?

01:14:16.042 --> 01:14:17.042
Hey

01:14:20.167 --> 01:14:22.042
move to the shower.

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:25.083
There is a set of handcuffs. Cuff yourself.

01:14:28.958 --> 01:14:29.958
What?

01:14:30.417 --> 01:14:32.292
Cuff yourself to the pipe, now!

01:14:50.125 --> 01:14:53.000
I don't want to do this.
But I don't know you,

01:14:53.542 --> 01:14:55.292
and I don't know if you are infected.

01:14:56.167 --> 01:14:58.407
Please do as I say. I am
absolutely prepared to kill you.

01:15:01.167 --> 01:15:02.167
Move.

01:15:14.125 --> 01:15:15.125
Cuff yourself.

01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:49.750
Sorry.

01:15:50.542 --> 01:15:53.417
I know it's cold. It's a
chemical disinfecting solution.

01:15:53.833 --> 01:15:56.708
I'm not sure if it will work.
But it's better than nothing.

01:15:57.417 --> 01:15:59.125
Itsfinks.

01:15:59.417 --> 01:16:00.417
You'll have to endure it.

01:16:04.792 --> 01:16:08.000
You don't seem infected.
You might be immune.

01:16:08.583 --> 01:16:11.000
There's a small possibility.

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:13.500
What's your blood type?

01:16:21.875 --> 01:16:23.125
Take off your clothes.

01:16:25.583 --> 01:16:28.167
They are covered in contaminated tissue.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.292
I'll give you dry scrubs.

01:16:35.083 --> 01:16:36.883
How am I supposed to
undress myself like this?

01:16:40.917 --> 01:16:41.917
You'll figure it out.

01:16:50.083 --> 01:16:51.083
Are you a doctor?

01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:52.958
Virologist.

01:16:55.167 --> 01:16:57.042
Why are you here in the maternity ward?

01:16:59.083 --> 01:17:02.000
They were renovating
this floor. It's been empty.

01:17:03.333 --> 01:17:06.875
This door is actually the
strongest door in the whole hospital.

01:17:07.458 --> 01:17:10.667
Maternity wards have
these thick metal doors.

01:17:12.208 --> 01:17:14.368
I guess its so parents feel
like their babies are safe.

01:17:15.167 --> 01:17:16.917
But who would ever want to steal a baby?

01:17:28.125 --> 01:17:29.125
Do you have children?

01:17:34.042 --> 01:17:35.625
Can you turn around?

01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:38.500
Oh.

01:17:49.708 --> 01:17:51.792
No kids... you are lucky.

01:17:52.833 --> 01:17:54.917
I feel sorry for those who have kids.

01:17:57.042 --> 01:17:59.792
This Alvin virus has ruined our
lives and destroyed the future.

01:18:03.167 --> 01:18:04.167
Are you done?

01:18:54.708 --> 01:18:57.583
If you are infected, you should
be showing symptoms already.

01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:03.610
I'll take some blood samples
from you after you are dressed.

01:19:25.833 --> 01:19:27.292
Sorry if I scared you with the gun.

01:19:27.833 --> 01:19:29.292
It's just for protection.

01:19:29.917 --> 01:19:30.625
A few months ago

01:19:30.875 --> 01:19:33.917
I realized I might need a
gun so I 3d—printed one.

01:19:34.417 --> 01:19:35.577
This is definitely not a toy.

01:19:36.792 --> 01:19:38.192
And luckily, I kept a few rounds...

01:19:38.292 --> 01:19:40.500
As souvenirs from my
military service. Got it?

01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:48.000
For a full year, I tried to tell
people this virus would mutate.

01:19:48.583 --> 01:19:51.792
But no one trusts doctors anymore.

01:19:52.542 --> 01:19:55.083
Everything must be politicized.
There can no longer be truth.

01:19:55.125 --> 01:19:56.750
Politicians are the worst.

01:19:57.750 --> 01:20:01.500
A nation—wide lockdown probably
felt like career suicide to them.

01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:05.333
It's an election year...
And they don't want to risk...

01:20:06.083 --> 01:20:08.667
Driving the country into a recession.

01:20:10.875 --> 01:20:13.156
This virus... it's like being
possessed by an evil spirit.

01:20:13.917 --> 01:20:16.167
It affects the iimbic system in our brain.

01:20:16.292 --> 01:20:18.667
It connects the area that
regulates aggression...

01:20:18.708 --> 01:20:21.250
To the area that governs sexual drive.

01:20:21.583 --> 01:20:24.417
These areas of the brain
aren't terribly dissimilar.

01:20:26.083 --> 01:20:27.763
This is quite academic, are you following?

01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:29.500
But...

01:20:30.667 --> 01:20:33.958
I believe this viral mutation
happened by natural processes.

01:20:34.875 --> 01:20:36.917
The limbic system is no joke.

01:20:37.375 --> 01:20:41.667
We think humans are intelligent
organisms that can reason...

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.458
And make logical decisions.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.042
But...

01:20:47.375 --> 01:20:48.667
The reality is

01:20:49.167 --> 01:20:51.167
we are slaves to our iimbic systems.

01:20:51.458 --> 01:20:54.917
The higher brain exists only to serve it.

01:20:56.875 --> 01:20:58.393
Incidentally, there are documented cases

01:20:58.417 --> 01:21:00.250
where patients with damaged iimbic systems

01:21:00.833 --> 01:21:03.833
are unable to escape
the feeling of intense thirst.

01:21:04.667 --> 01:21:06.333
They would keep drinking and drinking

01:21:06.375 --> 01:21:07.708
until they drown themselves!

01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:11.000
That's the really unnerving part.

01:21:12.167 --> 01:21:14.875
Those infected men, who
went after you in the hallway...

01:21:15.667 --> 01:21:17.958
They likely understand
that the things they are doing

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.750
are vile and repugnant.

01:21:20.083 --> 01:21:23.333
But the desire is too
strong for them to resist.

01:21:24.708 --> 01:21:26.588
Asking them not to
indulge in those vile desires

01:21:27.042 --> 01:21:30.417
is like asking you not to blink.

01:21:34.958 --> 01:21:37.500
It's hard not to blink, right?

01:21:38.583 --> 01:21:44.125
Who knows, maybe they're
crying because they feel guilty.

01:21:47.167 --> 01:21:50.708
The virus leaves virtually
every brain function intact.

01:21:50.875 --> 01:21:52.635
And it doesn't impede
the imagination at all.

01:21:52.750 --> 01:21:54.042
On the contrary...

01:21:54.917 --> 01:21:57.157
It makes you do the most
horrific things you can imagine.

01:22:01.833 --> 01:22:05.542
I think this is why the
infected don't attack each other.

01:22:07.167 --> 01:22:11.792
For them to be satisfied,
their victims must suffer.

01:22:14.042 --> 01:22:17.125
You can't rape the willing, right?

01:22:17.250 --> 01:22:18.250
Right?

01:22:20.792 --> 01:22:22.192
How do you know if you never tried?

01:22:24.625 --> 01:22:25.917
Hey, are you done?

01:22:25.958 --> 01:22:27.458
Let's run the blood test.

01:22:30.792 --> 01:22:31.792
Just a minute...

01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:38.167
It didn't have to be this complicated...

01:24:00.167 --> 01:24:01.667
Forget about the blood test.

01:24:01.708 --> 01:24:03.828
I just injected you with a
culture of the Alvin virus.

01:24:04.250 --> 01:24:07.125
If you are not immune, you
will exhibit symptoms very soon.

01:24:09.250 --> 01:24:11.000
I'm going to check on you in 5 minutes.

01:24:12.375 --> 01:24:14.255
If you are not showing
any signs of infection...

01:24:14.333 --> 01:24:15.917
We'll go to the roof.

01:24:16.583 --> 01:24:17.958
There will be a helicopter for us.

01:24:19.292 --> 01:24:22.583
We might be able to use
you to develop a vaccine.

01:24:24.208 --> 01:24:26.375
If I open the curtain and find you infected

01:24:27.833 --> 01:24:29.250
I'll kill you.

01:24:31.042 --> 01:24:32.082
I know you don't trust me.

01:24:32.750 --> 01:24:34.190
Nor would you want to leave with me.

01:24:34.750 --> 01:24:36.000
But think about it.

01:24:36.917 --> 01:24:38.667
Your blood could be used to save lives.

01:24:39.833 --> 01:24:41.513
Who knows? Maybe you could save the world.

01:24:52.708 --> 01:24:53.708
Fuck.

01:24:57.458 --> 01:25:00.833
When I got here. The staff was gone.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.958
But there were 8 infants abandoned here.

01:25:04.917 --> 01:25:08.125
I could barely convince the
government to pick me up.

01:25:11.125 --> 01:25:14.333
Those maniacs... if they
had found those babies...

01:25:14.750 --> 01:25:17.167
They would have fucked them...

01:25:17.250 --> 01:25:19.083
Then they would have eaten them.

01:25:19.708 --> 01:25:20.708
If I didn't kill them...

01:25:22.833 --> 01:25:24.042
They would be in worse hands.

01:25:25.667 --> 01:25:28.542
Then I realized, maybe one of these babies

01:25:28.667 --> 01:25:30.467
might be able to generate
valuable antibodies.

01:25:31.417 --> 01:25:34.417
So I injected them all with the virus.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.167
Have I done something wrong?

01:25:37.333 --> 01:25:38.493
Have I done something wrong?!

01:25:39.208 --> 01:25:41.208
They would be dead anyway!

01:25:41.250 --> 01:25:43.059
I made the most logical
decision that was available to me.

01:25:43.083 --> 01:25:44.792
Do you get that? Huh?

01:25:52.250 --> 01:25:54.792
They all got infected, not
a single one was immune.

01:26:03.292 --> 01:26:06.083
I guess one was a little
more tenacious than the rest...

01:26:06.125 --> 01:26:07.645
He managed to survive a little longer.

01:26:08.875 --> 01:26:09.875
That's all

01:26:43.417 --> 01:26:46.458
“8th floor maternity
ward. This man has a gun.”

01:26:50.708 --> 01:26:53.583
“Pick up at ntu hospital, rooftop helipad”

01:26:53.625 --> 01:26:56.458
“eta: 5 minutes, Dr. A.
Wong. Chief of virology.”

01:27:22.250 --> 01:27:23.583
How do you feel right now?

01:27:29.208 --> 01:27:30.542
Put that gun away...

01:28:10.833 --> 01:28:11.833
Where's the axe?

01:28:23.917 --> 01:28:25.458
Is your pussy getting wet?

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.000
The next...

01:28:40.750 --> 01:28:41.750
Fuck!

01:28:47.375 --> 01:28:48.975
You fucking piece of shit! Motherfucker!

01:29:04.875 --> 01:29:06.208
Get me up!

01:29:07.458 --> 01:29:09.378
You won't have the access
to the roof without me!

01:29:10.375 --> 01:29:12.417
Why are you still standing
there? Help me up!

01:29:19.792 --> 01:29:20.792
Fuck!

01:29:30.833 --> 01:29:31.833
Get me up!

01:29:33.042 --> 01:29:34.042
Get me up!

01:29:38.417 --> 01:29:39.417
Now move!

01:29:40.625 --> 01:29:42.265
They are not going to take you like this.

01:29:42.875 --> 01:29:44.875
Shut up, hurry up!

01:30:00.833 --> 01:30:02.042
Kat...

01:30:03.375 --> 01:30:04.792
I made it.

01:30:06.208 --> 01:30:10.042
I promised you I'd make it here...

01:30:12.042 --> 01:30:13.042
Oh?

01:30:14.333 --> 01:30:16.625
Is this your new boyfriend?

01:30:18.958 --> 01:30:21.458
No, Jim.

01:30:21.917 --> 01:30:24.083
Are you running away from me now?

01:30:26.958 --> 01:30:29.542
Thank you for taking care of Kat.

01:30:31.375 --> 01:30:33.292
Now...

01:30:34.875 --> 01:30:37.333
I'm going to chop your dick off,

01:30:39.083 --> 01:30:40.375
and feed it you!

01:30:40.417 --> 01:30:41.417
You motherfucker!

01:30:44.125 --> 01:30:45.125
Move!

01:31:07.375 --> 01:31:10.917
I killed those babies... and...

01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:15.667
It felt so good... so good.

01:31:57.542 --> 01:31:59.042
You found me.

01:32:06.917 --> 01:32:08.625
Kat...

01:32:10.292 --> 01:32:11.333
Open the gate.

01:32:21.542 --> 01:32:22.833
How does it feel?

01:32:30.583 --> 01:32:32.083
It feels...

01:32:35.583 --> 01:32:36.750
Wonderful...

01:32:40.042 --> 01:32:41.833
I feel like...

01:32:46.042 --> 01:32:48.125
I finally have a purpose in life.

01:32:51.708 --> 01:32:53.125
What purpose?

01:32:54.583 --> 01:32:56.792
You... you are my purpose.

01:32:58.625 --> 01:33:00.083
Kat...

01:33:01.542 --> 01:33:02.625
Listen to me...

01:33:03.958 --> 01:33:05.667
When I heard your voice today...

01:33:06.792 --> 01:33:09.000
On the phone...

01:33:09.625 --> 01:33:11.125
You sounded so scared.

01:33:12.208 --> 01:33:13.458
You said you needed me.

01:33:19.125 --> 01:33:22.458
I knew I had to find you.

01:33:26.083 --> 01:33:28.042
I needed to be with you.

01:33:31.167 --> 01:33:32.833
And then...

01:33:34.917 --> 01:33:37.292
Cut your tits off.

01:33:39.958 --> 01:33:42.458
And smash your face.

01:33:46.667 --> 01:33:48.250
Kat, look at me.

01:33:50.167 --> 01:33:53.333
I'll peel your skin off... so slowly.

01:33:59.875 --> 01:34:01.875
Look at me.

01:34:04.250 --> 01:34:05.542
Kat...

01:34:10.125 --> 01:34:12.542
Don't you realize how much I need you?

01:34:15.583 --> 01:34:17.792
Don't you realize how much I love you?

01:34:35.750 --> 01:34:37.583
Hey, I really love you.
