01:00:29.087 --> 01:00:30.921
Let's start with the pizzicato

01:00:33.383 --> 01:00:35.259
Can you play the track a little lower?

01:00:35.385 --> 01:00:36.468
Lower?

01:00:37.137 --> 01:00:38.846
Lower the track in the headphones

01:00:59.993 --> 01:01:04.413
l am devoted to you my love

01:01:04.539 --> 01:01:08.709
Your beauty makes me love you

01:01:08.835 --> 01:01:14.131
l'm devoted to you my love

01:01:21.014 --> 01:01:22.181
You mean like this

01:01:26.770 --> 01:01:31.231
With you by my side, my love

01:01:36.488 --> 01:01:43.702
You turn the night into day

01:01:45.205 --> 01:01:50.250
You've captured my heart

01:01:50.877 --> 01:01:54.630
You've cast a spell on me

01:01:54.756 --> 01:02:00.594
You make me blossom
like a jasmine flower

01:02:04.432 --> 01:02:08.644
l want to be with you forever

01:02:09.479 --> 01:02:13.565
The world is beautiful when l am with you

01:02:21.574 --> 01:02:24.118
l am devoted to you

01:02:26.371 --> 01:02:29.832
l want to be with you forever

01:03:13.835 --> 01:03:16.920
Your love sets me on fire

01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:21.675
When we're together l have no rest

01:03:23.261 --> 01:03:25.971
You light up my desire

01:05:31.890 --> 01:05:34.516
Hi. Avit

01:05:35.310 --> 01:05:36.518
Trishna

01:05:37.270 --> 01:05:38.687
You dance really well

01:05:39.481 --> 01:05:41.023
l'm a dance co-ordinator

01:05:41.149 --> 01:05:44.526
l help organise the classes
and the dancers for shoots

01:05:44.652 --> 01:05:46.820
That sort of thing

01:05:49.366 --> 01:05:50.783
Not for me thanks

01:05:55.288 --> 01:05:56.705
How long have you been here?

01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.207
ln Bombay?

01:06:00.877 --> 01:06:01.752
ls she a friend of yours?

01:06:01.795 --> 01:06:03.128
Yes she is

01:06:04.005 --> 01:06:04.963
You didn't even introduce me

01:06:05.131 --> 01:06:06.590
You didn't give us a chance to

01:06:06.716 --> 01:06:08.550
l was just giving her some advice

01:12:43.405 --> 01:12:44.405
How much are the bananas?

01:12:44.614 --> 01:12:45.447
Thirty rupees

01:12:45.490 --> 01:12:46.323
Thirty?

01:12:49.327 --> 01:12:54.039
Do you think you will have to pay
a high price for your mistakes?

01:13:44.215 --> 01:13:45.382
How are you?

01:13:46.009 --> 01:13:47.301
lt's been ages

01:13:47.427 --> 01:13:49.136
You haven't called or anything

01:13:49.304 --> 01:13:50.721
Sorry

01:13:51.306 --> 01:13:52.222
So tell me

01:13:52.349 --> 01:13:53.724
What's happened?

01:13:53.850 --> 01:13:54.892
Nothing, l've just been at home

01:13:55.018 --> 01:13:56.101
Have you heard from Jay?

01:13:57.020 --> 01:13:58.312
He hasn't called?

01:13:58.438 --> 01:14:00.397
No news at all?

01:14:01.816 --> 01:14:04.360
From the ten husbands in this competition

01:14:04.652 --> 01:14:07.363
The one who is strongest will survive

01:14:14.412 --> 01:14:15.412
Hello?

01:14:16.456 --> 01:14:17.414
l'm sorry

01:14:18.124 --> 01:14:19.958
l was assuming this flat would be vacant

01:14:20.919 --> 01:14:22.503
The lease is up

01:14:22.629 --> 01:14:24.838
So you have to vacate the flat

01:14:26.591 --> 01:14:27.675
When?

01:14:28.677 --> 01:14:29.843
This weekend?

01:14:31.846 --> 01:14:33.639
ls it OK if l have a quick look around?

01:14:34.391 --> 01:14:35.557
Yes go ahead

01:15:07.757 --> 01:15:09.341
Good morning, are you hungry?

01:15:09.467 --> 01:15:10.300
Yes

01:15:10.385 --> 01:15:12.261
l'll get you some breakfast

01:15:12.679 --> 01:15:13.679
- Aggie!
- Yes?

01:15:13.805 --> 01:15:14.805
Come on

01:15:31.656 --> 01:15:33.240
Can l take your number?

01:15:52.052 --> 01:15:53.594
So this is what a shoot looks like

01:15:54.387 --> 01:15:56.013
Wow, look at all those lights!

01:15:56.139 --> 01:15:59.391
Yes, it's very different to rehearsals

01:16:09.986 --> 01:16:12.529
This is playback from 'A' Camera

01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:16.950
They're good dancers

01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:18.494
You think so?

01:16:42.310 --> 01:16:44.103
Thousands have been destroyed!

01:16:44.312 --> 01:16:45.729
So many hunted!

01:16:46.106 --> 01:16:49.024
All the boys are keen to impress

01:16:49.567 --> 01:16:51.777
An endless queue, right and left

01:16:51.986 --> 01:16:53.737
They beg for love

01:16:53.863 --> 01:16:56.990
Oh there will be tension!

01:17:07.961 --> 01:17:10.921
lt's good to come to shoots like that

01:17:12.257 --> 01:17:15.134
You can make good contacts

01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:17.386
People who can help your career

01:17:19.848 --> 01:17:23.726
One thing you need to do
is get a Cine Dancer Card

01:17:25.061 --> 01:17:26.687
lt's very important

01:17:26.813 --> 01:17:28.605
l can help you get one

01:17:29.149 --> 01:17:31.567
- All dancers have them?
- Yes all dancers

01:17:31.693 --> 01:17:33.027
lt costs money

01:17:33.611 --> 01:17:34.987
30,000 rupees to start with

01:17:35.822 --> 01:17:40.993
Then after that once you start getting work
you can pay off the rest in installments

01:17:41.119 --> 01:17:43.871
l don't have that kind of money

01:17:44.497 --> 01:17:46.874
Take the 30,000 from me

01:17:47.751 --> 01:17:50.294
Once you start working
you can pay me off

01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:52.338
You'll take it?

01:17:53.089 --> 01:17:54.340
Promise?

01:22:27.739 --> 01:22:29.865
Just put it down

01:27:32.794 --> 01:27:34.420
Shall we go inside?

01:28:47.827 --> 01:28:48.911
Trishna?

01:28:49.037 --> 01:28:50.079
Yes?

01:28:52.332 --> 01:28:54.166
Do you know Jay Singh from before?

01:28:55.502 --> 01:28:56.585
Yes

01:28:57.379 --> 01:28:58.671
Where do you know him from?

01:29:03.301 --> 01:29:05.052
From another hotel

01:29:06.888 --> 01:29:09.056
Before this you were in Mumbai right?

01:29:13.436 --> 01:29:15.229
Which hotel in Mumbai?

01:29:16.940 --> 01:29:19.274
l was staying at a friend's house

01:29:21.986 --> 01:29:23.612
l see

01:38:16.688 --> 01:38:19.565
This is the truth

01:38:19.899 --> 01:38:24.361
The truth love has taught me

01:38:24.738 --> 01:38:29.158
My love, you showed me
how the world really is

01:38:58.438 --> 01:39:01.940
You showed me a place
where the storm never ends

01:39:03.234 --> 01:39:07.321
You showed me a world
where the night never ends

01:39:07.572 --> 01:39:12.076
You took me to the realm of love

01:39:12.327 --> 01:39:16.455
With you by my side,
l left this world behind

01:39:20.085 --> 01:39:23.462
Every moment l was filled with fear

01:39:24.881 --> 01:39:27.883
Every step l took made me more afraid

01:39:29.052 --> 01:39:33.013
My love, you turned my day into night

01:39:33.848 --> 01:39:39.228
My love, why did you do this to me?

01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:21.729
You showed me a place
where the storm never ends

01:40:22.355 --> 01:40:26.191
You showed me a world
where the night never ends

01:40:26.693 --> 01:40:30.404
You took me to the realm of love

01:40:31.448 --> 01:40:36.160
With you by my side,
l left this world behind

01:40:39.330 --> 01:40:42.708
Every moment l was filled with fear

01:40:44.127 --> 01:40:47.713
Every step l took made me more afraid

01:40:48.173 --> 01:40:52.760
My love, you turned my day into night

01:40:52.969 --> 01:40:57.556
My love, why did you do this to me?

01:41:00.602 --> 01:41:02.811
Wow, you've got so big!

01:41:05.315 --> 01:41:06.482
And a new school uniform

01:41:06.608 --> 01:41:10.235
Lakshman, how are you?

01:41:23.708 --> 01:41:25.000

01:41:29.005 --> 01:41:30.673
Pratiksha?

01:41:31.883 --> 01:41:33.092
Hey sis it's you

01:41:35.387 --> 01:41:36.595
God you've got tall!

01:41:38.098 --> 01:41:40.099
Step down, let me see you properly

01:41:40.809 --> 01:41:41.892
New school uniform?

01:41:42.060 --> 01:41:43.352

01:42:15.260 --> 01:42:16.885
Get me some water

01:42:26.104 --> 01:42:27.062
When did she get here?

01:42:27.188 --> 01:42:28.230
Just now

01:42:30.900 --> 01:42:32.234
This is for you

01:42:33.611 --> 01:42:35.029
You can wear this to a wedding

01:42:35.155 --> 01:42:36.572
Maybe even your wedding

01:42:36.740 --> 01:42:37.573
Nice

Oh wow! You look like Shahrukh Khan

Come on let's eat

01:42:57.177 --> 01:43:00.095
Lakshman stop fighting

01:43:02.098 --> 01:43:03.807
So where's your husband?

01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:07.019
Who?

01:43:11.900 --> 01:43:14.902
Everybody knows that l'm living off you

01:43:18.656 --> 01:43:20.532
You should be happy

01:43:21.701 --> 01:43:23.327
You have a newjeep

01:43:27.707 --> 01:43:29.625

Have you brushed your teeth? Dirty girl

01:44:22.345 --> 01:44:24.221
Then pack your schoolbags

01:44:38.194 --> 01:44:40.237
Do all your homework

01:44:41.364 --> 01:44:43.741
No TV tonight

01:44:53.668 --> 01:44:55.502
