Absolutely.

02:40.027 --> 02:40.861
- What did I just say?

02:40.896 --> 02:42.368
- I love this game.

02:43.536 --> 02:47.065
Let me see, I think
it started with-

02:47.100 --> 02:49.375
- What happened to your head?

02:49.410 --> 02:50.574
- Nothing, no big deal.

02:50.609 --> 02:51.905
- What did you do last night?

02:51.940 --> 02:53.313
- Nothing mom, I'm fine, okay?

02:53.348 --> 02:56.250

You can't do that anymore.

02:57.814 --> 03:00.749
Honey, I want you to be okay.

03:04.249 --> 03:05.215
- And get a haircut.

- Mom.

03:06.328 --> 03:07.954
- You look like a bum.

03:07.989 --> 03:09.890
- I think I look
like a musician.

03:09.925 --> 03:12.090
- But you're not a musician now.

03:13.566 --> 03:17.502
- You know what? I'm
not even that hungry.

03:17.537 --> 03:19.999

05:11.750 --> 05:13.387

05:13.422 --> 05:15.114
- There's no way

05:15.919 --> 05:17.281

05:17.316 --> 05:18.953
He just doesn't
talk to me anymore.

05:18.988 --> 05:20.724
It's like he's
living on autopilot.

05:20.759 --> 05:22.990
- This kid needs
some tough love.

05:23.025 --> 05:25.696
You need to get in

05:29.735 --> 05:30.866
- You know I can
hear you, right?

05:30.901 --> 05:32.934
- What? I can't hear you, Marco.

05:32.969 --> 05:35.299
Can you speak louder?

05:35.334 --> 05:36.740
- Mom, can we please just...

05:36.775 --> 05:38.973
- Hi sweetie.

05:39.008 --> 05:40.304
- Hey Liana.

05:40.339 --> 05:41.712
- Mark, you know,

05:41.747 --> 05:44.946
I think you need to
get out of the house

05:44.981 --> 05:47.113
and do something with your life.

05:47.148 --> 05:49.621
- Yeah, oh, sorry Tia,
can you repeat that?

05:49.656 --> 05:51.425
We can't hear you, we're
going through a tunnel.

05:51.460 --> 05:53.383
- Tunnel? Don't you dare Marco.

05:58.258 --> 05:59.466
- Mark, honey.

05:59.501 --> 06:01.864
- Hey Mark, is that
Paparico, taste?

06:01.899 --> 06:02.865
Thanks for the dinner,

06:02.900 --> 06:04.768
you clearly put a lot
of effort into it.

06:04.803 --> 06:06.099
- I mean, you know she's right.

06:06.134 --> 06:08.574
It's not healthy for you
to be moping around all day

06:08.609 --> 06:10.301
staring at photos of Lyla.

06:10.336 --> 06:11.544
- You know we can be in silence

06:11.579 --> 06:13.172
and still enjoy each
other's company, right?

06:13.207 --> 06:16.648
- Why not? If you
don't wanna talk to me.

06:17.783 --> 06:19.717
Why don't you go talk
to that therapist,

06:19.752 --> 06:21.686
you used to be able
to talk to her.

06:21.721 --> 06:22.918
- When I was 12.

06:22.953 --> 06:24.051
- This is similar.

06:24.086 --> 06:26.889
You did the same thing
when your dad took off.

06:26.924 --> 06:29.155
- Mom, I'm not gonna go to
my childhood therapist, okay?

06:29.190 --> 06:30.090
- What about your friends?

06:30.125 --> 06:32.862
- What about them?

06:32.897 --> 06:34.094
- Can you talk to them?

06:34.129 --> 06:35.832
- Only if I want
my head to explode.

06:35.867 --> 06:38.538
- Why? Preston, Robin, Kaitlyn,

06:38.573 --> 06:39.803
you love those guys.

06:39.838 --> 06:41.475
- Mom, drop it, okay? Relax.

06:41.510 --> 06:42.674
- Mark .

06:42.709 --> 06:44.038
- I'm fine.

06:44.073 --> 06:45.171
- You're not.

07:29.558 --> 07:30.414
Mark, stop.

07:31.989 --> 07:34.286
Put the phone down.

07:34.321 --> 07:35.958
You need to try this.

07:35.993 --> 07:37.663
- Ew, is that hot sauce.

07:37.698 --> 07:38.994
- I know, I know,

07:39.029 --> 07:41.799
but this is the best
thing you will try today.

07:41.834 --> 07:43.669
Well, second best.

07:43.704 --> 07:45.297
- No, you
try it, psychopath.

07:45.332 --> 07:47.904
- Oh, come on, you will love it.

07:50.106 --> 07:50.874
- Oh my God.

07:52.108 --> 07:53.503
This is disgusting.

07:55.012 --> 07:55.780
You...

08:30.982 --> 08:33.213
- Oh, we got your results.

08:35.283 --> 08:39.186
Mark, there are some
things we need to discuss.

08:40.321 --> 08:41.122
- Okay.

08:41.993 --> 08:44.158
What sort of things?

08:44.193 --> 08:47.799
- Specifically, your
dysfunctional parietal lobe

08:47.834 --> 08:50.296
and the subsequent damage it's
caused the rest of your body.

08:50.331 --> 08:53.002
- Do you know English
by any chance?

08:53.037 --> 08:58.073
- There's a section of your
brain that is not working.

08:58.108 --> 09:00.647
And that's causing damage to
other organs in your body,

09:00.682 --> 09:02.572
starting with your heart.

09:02.607 --> 09:05.014
Low blood pressure and
abnormal heart rhythms,

09:05.049 --> 09:07.885
which may affect blood
flow to your brain.

09:07.920 --> 09:08.820
- Oh, okay?

09:09.724 --> 09:11.152
- I'm not done.

09:11.187 --> 09:12.659
- Oh, there's more.

09:12.694 --> 09:13.990
- Hmm.

09:14.025 --> 09:15.453
You will suffer from memory loss

09:15.488 --> 09:18.731
and auditory and
visual hallucinations.

09:18.766 --> 09:20.029
- Hallucinations?

09:20.064 --> 09:21.129
- Seeing and hearing
people and anomalies

09:21.164 --> 09:22.933
that aren't really there.

09:22.968 --> 09:25.364
The more you experience
these hallucinations,

09:25.399 --> 09:27.168
the closer you maybe,

09:32.241 --> 09:33.746
well, to the end.

09:38.819 --> 09:40.577
Unfortunately, we
caught this late

09:40.612 --> 09:44.251
so this is a
difficult situation.

09:44.286 --> 09:45.318
But we will be working with you

09:45.353 --> 09:48.222
on doing whatever we
can to minimize it,

09:48.257 --> 09:50.620
and figure how to make sure
that you're comfortable.

09:50.655 --> 09:52.490
This is a very exciting
moment for us actually,

09:52.525 --> 09:54.162
'cause we've never seen
anything like this and-

09:54.197 --> 09:55.229
- Okay.

09:58.740 --> 09:59.530
Thank you.

10:07.507 --> 10:09.078
Goodbye Dr. Cobb.

10:10.818 --> 10:15.084
- Mark, look, I know
this is shocking news.

10:15.119 --> 10:16.789
- Sorry, I don't
mean to be rude.

10:16.824 --> 10:19.616
I just, I wanna
go home right now.

10:20.861 --> 10:23.092
- I'm sorry, I'm just
a little bit confused.

10:23.127 --> 10:24.324
Are you really saying

10:24.359 --> 10:25.930
that you don't wanna
do anything about this?

10:25.965 --> 10:27.162
There are ways we can help.

10:27.197 --> 10:28.526
We can speak with
hospitals and specialists.

10:28.561 --> 10:33.168
- Can you promise we're
gonna change anything?

10:33.203 --> 10:35.236
- At least talk with
your family about this,

10:35.271 --> 10:39.504
or a friend, whoever you
think might be able to help.

10:39.539 --> 10:41.440
What else can you do?

10:44.885 --> 10:46.577
- I can say goodbye.

10:49.824 --> 10:52.891
- Don't leave
anything unfinished.

10:52.926 --> 10:55.322
- Thank you, for everything.

11:40.567 --> 11:41.401
You got this.

11:44.175 --> 11:45.339
This is stupid.

11:45.374 --> 11:48.507
- You should run
while you still can.

11:51.479 --> 11:53.083
- Any particular reason?

11:53.118 --> 11:57.054
- Well, aside from the fact
that the food is horrible,

11:57.089 --> 11:59.485
it's kind of got a weird vibe.

11:59.520 --> 12:01.586
- It's not that bad.

12:01.621 --> 12:02.488
- You hate yourself?

12:02.523 --> 12:04.094
- What?

12:04.129 --> 12:05.491
- You've been here before
and tried the food,

12:05.526 --> 12:08.164
and yet you insist
on coming back.

12:08.199 --> 12:10.529
It leads me to think
that you hate yourself.

12:10.564 --> 12:11.871
- No.

12:11.906 --> 12:12.971
- You don't have
a lighter, do you?

12:13.006 --> 12:14.874
- Oh, I don't actually.

12:16.768 --> 12:18.537
I'm sorry, I don't even
know why I checked.

12:18.572 --> 12:20.638
I knew I didn't bring
one in the first place.

12:20.673 --> 12:22.442
I'm Mark, and you are?

12:23.643 --> 12:25.280
- Slightly amused.

12:27.086 --> 12:28.349
- Nice to meet you.

12:28.384 --> 12:31.253
- We've already met,
Mr. Mark Goldman.

12:38.097 --> 12:39.294
See you later.

12:48.602 --> 12:49.667
- What's up?

12:49.702 --> 12:51.207
- Hallucinations?

12:51.242 --> 12:52.142
- Seeing and
hearing people and anomalies

12:52.177 --> 12:54.474
that aren't really there.

12:54.509 --> 12:55.541
- Mark.

12:56.478 --> 12:57.411
- Hey guys.

13:07.753 --> 13:09.720
I'm glad to see you guys
still hang out here.

13:09.755 --> 13:11.458
- Where else would we go, Mark?

13:11.493 --> 13:13.460
- So, how have you been?

13:14.529 --> 13:16.529
- Oh my God, just spit it out.

13:16.564 --> 13:17.596
- What?

13:17.631 --> 13:19.664
- We haven't seen you
in forever, Goldman?

13:19.699 --> 13:21.039
Not since you got dumped.
- Ira.

13:21.074 --> 13:22.502
- And then all of a
sudden you text us

13:22.537 --> 13:23.701
saying you need to see us?

13:23.736 --> 13:25.879
- Nice fanny pack.

13:25.914 --> 13:27.375
- I'm not wearing a fanny pack.

13:27.410 --> 13:28.838
- Yes.

13:28.873 --> 13:29.740
- She's right Goldman.

13:29.775 --> 13:31.115
Oh, that's good, she's right.

13:31.150 --> 13:33.084
We all got busy
schedules, right guys?

13:33.119 --> 13:34.580
Right?

13:34.615 --> 13:35.713
- Yeah, I'm keeping busy.
- So what's going?

13:35.748 --> 13:37.924
Go on and tell us what's up.

13:39.488 --> 13:40.751
- I haven't been a
good friend, okay?

13:41.754 --> 13:42.995
- Let him talk.

13:43.030 --> 13:44.623
- I ghosted you guys
for a while there.

13:44.658 --> 13:48.198
I just was going through
some pretty shady times,

13:48.233 --> 13:49.166
I still am.

13:50.400 --> 13:53.170
I just, I thought
it would be better

13:54.371 --> 13:56.767
if I just dealt
with it on my own.

14:02.775 --> 14:05.413
I feel worse than Nick Jakoby
at the party.

14:05.448 --> 14:06.843
You guys remember that?

14:06.878 --> 14:08.614
Preston, you
remember this is man.

14:08.649 --> 14:10.924
Come on bro, I got
you man, I'm fine.

14:12.521 --> 14:16.061
All of a sudden, I see
this shower of vomit

14:16.096 --> 14:18.063
falling on top of Nick Jakoby.

14:18.098 --> 14:20.494
- Okay, that is not
exactly how it happened.

14:20.529 --> 14:22.826
- That is exactly
how it happened.

14:22.861 --> 14:24.762
- I missed you guys.

14:24.797 --> 14:26.038
- Yeah?

14:26.073 --> 14:27.435
You miss us Goldman.

14:27.470 --> 14:30.141
- Look, there's no easy
way of saying this but-

14:30.176 --> 14:32.077
- What do you want man?

14:33.212 --> 14:34.211
- I'm dying.

14:40.582 --> 14:42.384
- What are you saying?

14:43.321 --> 14:45.453
- Mark, what do you mean?

14:46.918 --> 14:50.062
- I don't know how
much time I got left.

14:50.097 --> 14:51.426
I just know it's not a lot.

14:51.461 --> 14:53.659
- Shut up you're not-
- That's freaking low.

14:53.694 --> 14:54.693
- Come down, okay?

14:54.728 --> 14:55.969
You're not, that
doesn't make any,

14:56.004 --> 14:57.630
I mean, look at
you, you look good.

14:57.665 --> 14:59.269
You look, you look healthy,
you look like you're in shape.

14:59.304 --> 15:00.897
You exercise, right?

15:00.932 --> 15:03.372
Have you been doing the, what
I taught to you, the routine?

15:03.407 --> 15:04.802
Have you been doing the
routine I taught you?

15:04.837 --> 15:05.638
- He's lying, okay?

15:05.673 --> 15:06.705
You're lying.

15:06.740 --> 15:07.772
- I'm not.

15:12.911 --> 15:15.351
- Have you told Lyla?

15:15.386 --> 15:16.748
- Why would he do that?

15:16.783 --> 15:20.092
- Easy,
they're not that bad.

15:20.127 --> 15:21.720
- I mean it, Lord of the Rings

15:21.755 --> 15:23.953
is the most perfect
of trilogies.

15:23.988 --> 15:26.824
Oh, I just, why
would you take three,

15:28.366 --> 15:31.829
how can you make three movies
out of three massive books,

15:31.864 --> 15:33.798
and then do the same
for one little book.

15:33.833 --> 15:35.899
It just makes zero sense to me.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.015
Have I lost you?

15:42.050 --> 15:44.413
- Not at all.

15:44.448 --> 15:46.085
- Ah-ah.

15:46.120 --> 15:47.911
- You meant it.

15:47.946 --> 15:49.253
Lord of the Rings

15:49.288 --> 15:51.651
was literally the most
perfect of trilogies.

15:51.686 --> 15:53.323
I mean, why would he do that?

15:53.358 --> 15:54.984
Why would he make
three epic movies

15:55.019 --> 15:56.458
out of three massive books,

15:56.493 --> 15:58.757
and then do the same again
with one little book?

15:58.792 --> 16:01.925
I mean, it makes no
sense whatsoever.

16:03.533 --> 16:04.730
No, I haven't.

16:07.702 --> 16:09.042
- You have to tell her.

16:09.077 --> 16:13.002
- No, no, I mean, we haven't
talked since we broke up.

16:13.037 --> 16:14.410
I'll probably never
see her again.

16:14.445 --> 16:15.906
- She's gonna be at
Trisha's party tonight.

16:15.941 --> 16:16.907
- I'm sorry, what?

16:16.942 --> 16:19.008
- She's gonna be at
Trisha's party tonight.

16:19.043 --> 16:20.416
- How do you, how
do you know that?

16:20.451 --> 16:21.417
- How do I know?

16:21.452 --> 16:22.880
Okay Goldman.

16:22.915 --> 16:23.848
I know you've been
gone for a little bit,

16:23.883 --> 16:25.157
but I'm Preston Humphreys, okay?

16:25.192 --> 16:26.455
If you need to know
about the party,

16:26.490 --> 16:27.786
the who, the what, the where,

16:27.821 --> 16:28.655
the why, the when,
and sometimes out.

16:28.690 --> 16:30.558
- Party? Are we dancing?

16:30.593 --> 16:32.560
Are we doing the conga line?

16:32.595 --> 16:33.858
- No, no, no, I-

16:33.893 --> 16:35.101
- You know you wanna
do a conga line?

16:35.136 --> 16:36.531
- No guys, guys.
- Oh, you're really trying

16:36.566 --> 16:37.862
to get out of doing
the conga line?

16:37.897 --> 16:38.929
- We love the conga line.

16:38.964 --> 16:41.074
- I can't party in
this state of mind.

16:41.109 --> 16:43.670
No, plus I'm, look at me.

16:43.705 --> 16:45.573
She will, no, no.

16:45.608 --> 16:48.147
And I'm like, no, no, no, no.

16:48.182 --> 16:50.039
No, it's okay, it's okay.

16:50.074 --> 16:51.942
Fine, I'm good, I'm good.

16:53.979 --> 16:55.550
- Can you finish a sentence?

16:56.388 --> 16:57.684
- You look great honey.

16:57.719 --> 17:00.093
- You cannot allow
your comfort zone

17:00.128 --> 17:03.756
to be the size of
a juice box Mark.

17:03.791 --> 17:05.428
- That was beautiful Robin.

17:05.463 --> 17:06.759
And the party is
gonna be huge, okay?

17:06.794 --> 17:07.859
It's gonna be massive.

17:07.894 --> 17:09.531
Don't get lost in the crowd.

17:09.566 --> 17:11.698
You damn sure need
to party, we all do.

17:11.733 --> 17:14.107
- Yeah, you owe us
that much, dick.

17:14.142 --> 17:15.867
Mark, you have to
tell her goodbye.

17:15.902 --> 17:19.541
- Who said humans can't
have fun at a party!

17:21.578 --> 17:22.478
- So?

17:27.254 --> 17:29.089
- Let's go, come on.

17:31.456 --> 17:34.017
Mark, okay, seriously, let's go.

17:35.922 --> 17:39.528
- Preston, you said this
was gonna be a huge party.

17:39.563 --> 17:41.024
- Yeah, so?

17:41.059 --> 17:43.730
- There's like 10 people here.

17:45.305 --> 17:46.205
- I'm gonna bail.

17:46.240 --> 17:48.141
I'm done feeling-

17:48.176 --> 17:49.406
- Hey, hey, hey, Mark.

17:49.441 --> 17:51.034
Hey, stop, don't do
this, you always do this.

17:51.069 --> 17:52.145
What are we here to do, okay?

17:52.180 --> 17:53.344
We're here to find Lyla.

17:53.379 --> 17:54.675
We're gonna have a good time,

17:54.710 --> 17:56.182
but we're gonna
stick together, okay?

17:56.217 --> 17:57.282
All for one, one for all.

17:57.317 --> 17:59.042
We are a unit, we're a team,

17:59.077 --> 18:00.450
and we're gonna stick
together, we're gonna find her,

18:00.485 --> 18:02.078
we're gonna, we're gonna,

18:02.113 --> 18:04.817
we, we, we need to
split up, right?

18:04.852 --> 18:05.752
We've gotta cover more ground.

18:05.787 --> 18:07.083
It just makes more sense.

18:07.118 --> 18:09.228
So we're gonna go, and we're
gonna find ladies, Lyla.

18:09.263 --> 18:10.757
We're gonna find Lyla, okay?

18:10.792 --> 18:12.121
And I'm gonna go this
way 'cause that's just,

18:12.156 --> 18:14.860
I got senses to just, you know.

18:14.895 --> 18:16.169
- I need a drink.

18:16.204 --> 18:17.126
- You got this, okay?

18:17.161 --> 18:18.094
- But I don't, I don't.
- You do, you do.

18:18.129 --> 18:20.030
- You guys, you guys.

18:22.771 --> 18:25.739
All right Robin, I guess
it's just you and...

18:25.774 --> 18:26.575
Robin?

18:27.446 --> 18:28.247
Robin, no.

18:31.483 --> 18:32.350
Robin.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.254
Robin, no, no, no, no.

18:35.289 --> 18:37.113
This is one of the nice ones.

18:37.148 --> 18:38.422
- Ah-ah, yeah, yeah.

18:38.457 --> 18:41.293
- Don't worry, it's
okay, it's okay.

18:41.328 --> 18:43.427
Yeah, we're good.

18:44.298 --> 18:46.089
- Yeah Mark.

18:46.124 --> 18:49.433
Play us some of your
sweet, sweet jams.

18:49.468 --> 18:50.302
Why are you whispering?

18:50.337 --> 18:51.963
I'm not playing, okay?

18:51.998 --> 18:52.766
- He's playing.

18:52.801 --> 18:53.635
- Sorry.

18:53.670 --> 18:54.438
- He's playing.

18:54.473 --> 18:55.208
- No, I'm not.

18:55.243 --> 18:56.374
- He's gonna be playing.

18:56.409 --> 18:58.002
- I don't wanna look dumb.

18:58.037 --> 18:59.575
I can't
believe who's here.

18:59.610 --> 19:00.510
- Who?

19:00.545 --> 19:01.841
- No, no, don't turn around.

19:01.876 --> 19:04.283
It's Damon McAllister.

19:04.318 --> 19:07.352
I used to be in his band.

19:07.387 --> 19:08.353
No big deal.

19:08.388 --> 19:10.047
- You think he
knows where Lyla is?

19:10.082 --> 19:12.258
- Don't, Robin, Robin.

19:12.293 --> 19:14.117
- Hey, whoa.

19:14.152 --> 19:14.920
How you doing buddy?

19:14.955 --> 19:16.152
- Hey Damon.

19:16.187 --> 19:17.758
Sorry, we were
just wondering if-

19:17.793 --> 19:19.265
- Yeah, I get what's
going on here.

19:19.300 --> 19:21.267
I appreciate it guys
but I have a girlfriend.

19:21.302 --> 19:22.598
Thank you.

19:22.633 --> 19:23.533
- Damon, it's me.

19:23.568 --> 19:24.369
- Yeah.

19:24.404 --> 19:25.832
- Mark.

19:25.867 --> 19:27.130
- Mark, my man.

19:27.165 --> 19:28.032
Hi, I have a girlfriend.

19:28.067 --> 19:29.308
- Mark from...

19:29.343 --> 19:31.134
- I went to every single
one of your concerts.

19:31.169 --> 19:32.410
- Oh dude, oh, thanks man,

19:32.445 --> 19:34.478
I appreciate fans, I really do.

19:34.513 --> 19:35.413
I really care about you guys.

19:35.448 --> 19:36.579
Thank you so much.

19:36.614 --> 19:37.712
- I carried your
instruments for a year.

19:37.747 --> 19:39.516
- Oh shit, I'm so sorry.

19:39.551 --> 19:40.319
Mark, yes.

19:41.718 --> 19:43.883
Mark that holds the guitar.

19:43.918 --> 19:45.786
My man, I perform
everywhere, you know.

19:45.821 --> 19:47.150
North Cali, LA.

19:48.362 --> 19:49.823
Mostly those two right now.

19:49.858 --> 19:51.220
Ah, sorry dude,

19:51.255 --> 19:52.496
faces are really hard
for me, I forget them.

19:52.531 --> 19:53.629
Unless you have
a face like this.

19:54.962 --> 19:56.632
Shit will stay in
your brain forever.

19:58.064 --> 20:00.372
But listen, enjoy yourself,

20:00.407 --> 20:02.341
grab a drink, have
a good time, yeah?

20:02.376 --> 20:04.904
Ladies, if I can just
get by you real quick.

20:04.939 --> 20:07.544
But yeah, have a good time, man.

20:11.979 --> 20:14.078
- Nah, no, no, you're not him.

20:14.113 --> 20:15.915
- What, I'm Mark Goldman.

20:15.950 --> 20:17.521
- No, no, no,

20:17.556 --> 20:19.886
Mark Goldman was that tall
athletic blonde angel.

20:19.921 --> 20:22.460
You know, with a
really nice body.

20:22.495 --> 20:23.428
Come on.

20:23.463 --> 20:25.958
- No, I'm Mark Goldman.

20:25.993 --> 20:27.960
- Who am I thinking of?

20:27.995 --> 20:31.436
- Let's just, let's
just, let's just go.

20:31.471 --> 20:32.998
- Bye Robin.

20:33.033 --> 20:34.197
- Do you remember Lyla?

20:34.232 --> 20:35.473
- Of course.

20:35.508 --> 20:37.068
- Awesome.

20:37.103 --> 20:38.377
We just wanted to know if
you knew if Lyla was coming.

20:38.412 --> 20:40.379
- Oh my God, you
were such a slut.

20:41.778 --> 20:43.514
- Excuse me.

20:43.549 --> 20:44.614
- Do you mind speaking up?

20:44.649 --> 20:47.452
I can barely hear you right now.

20:51.524 --> 20:52.523
- Oh, sorry.

20:53.823 --> 20:55.493
- Oh, you're good.

20:56.826 --> 20:57.594
- Okay.

20:59.466 --> 21:00.663
Hello again.

21:01.666 --> 21:03.666
- You look like you
need one of these.

21:03.701 --> 21:06.438
- I really shouldn't.

21:06.473 --> 21:11.201
- "You don't need to drink to
have fun," said no one ever.

21:12.776 --> 21:15.040
- I still don't know your name.

21:15.075 --> 21:15.843
- Rebecca.

21:16.879 --> 21:17.548
Your loss.

21:22.588 --> 21:25.622
It helps, you know,
especially on the rough days.

21:25.657 --> 21:27.283
- Oh.

21:27.318 --> 21:29.318
- Yeah, it's just, no one
here seems to remember me.

21:29.353 --> 21:30.594
- Same.

21:33.698 --> 21:34.994
- Hey Mark, we should...

21:35.029 --> 21:36.666
Are those flamingos?

21:36.701 --> 21:38.635
- Why don't you go play
with the flamingos big boy?

21:38.670 --> 21:39.702
- Mark.

21:39.737 --> 21:41.330
Flamingos, Mark.

21:41.365 --> 21:43.376
Flamingos, Mark.

21:43.411 --> 21:44.542
Flamingos, Mark.

21:44.577 --> 21:45.807
- Robin, I'll be fine.

21:45.842 --> 21:47.039
You can go.

21:47.074 --> 21:47.875
- Okay.

21:49.340 --> 21:50.240
- Sorry about that.

21:50.275 --> 21:51.076
- Cheers.

21:54.587 --> 21:57.115
All these clowns think
they can pull that crap

21:57.150 --> 21:58.787
just because they left.

21:58.822 --> 22:01.790
Like great, you could
make your life work here,

22:01.825 --> 22:03.396
so you ran away,

22:03.431 --> 22:05.761
spent thousands of
your parents dollars

22:05.796 --> 22:07.697
on an archaic institution

22:07.732 --> 22:10.095
that nowadays won't even
guarantee you a job.

22:10.130 --> 22:11.470
- Exactly.

22:11.505 --> 22:14.363
- But yeah, I'm supposed
to respect you for that.

22:14.398 --> 22:18.708
I guess none of them
appreciated what they had here.

22:19.777 --> 22:21.447
- You're so right.

22:26.784 --> 22:28.949
You wanna go check that out?

22:30.051 --> 22:31.919
- No, I'm good here.

22:31.954 --> 22:33.118
I'll see you down there.

22:33.153 --> 22:34.086
- You sure?

22:36.420 --> 22:38.123
Okay, I'll see you there.

22:50.610 --> 22:52.643
- You know what, I was
thinking since we're all here,

22:52.678 --> 22:54.007
we could probably
sing this song.

22:54.042 --> 22:57.043
You guys might know,
it's,

22:57.078 --> 23:01.113
♪ Twinkle twinkle little star ♪

23:02.116 --> 23:05.381
♪ How I wonder what you are ♪

23:05.416 --> 23:09.220
♪ Up above the world so high ♪

23:09.255 --> 23:13.191
♪ Like a diamond in the sky ♪

23:13.226 --> 23:14.467
- Hey Trish.

23:14.502 --> 23:15.358
- Hey you.

23:16.735 --> 23:19.604
- Do you know by any
chance, if Lyla is coming?

23:19.639 --> 23:21.001
- Oh she couldn't.

24:20.062 --> 24:21.325
- Here?

24:21.360 --> 24:23.965
I don't know if we'd
stay here forever.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.165
I mean, eventually

24:42.788 --> 24:45.591
All this time And I
still can't remember.

24:45.626 --> 24:47.252
- Remember what?

24:47.287 --> 24:49.694
- That moment when she left.

24:51.093 --> 24:53.896
I can remember everything
but that moment.

24:55.636 --> 24:58.868
She was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

24:58.903 --> 25:00.870
And I can't even
remember why she left.

25:00.905 --> 25:03.136
- If you don't
remember the moment,

25:03.171 --> 25:04.973
how are you so sure
that she left you.

25:05.008 --> 25:07.470
- We were perfect together.

25:07.505 --> 25:09.208
I wouldn't have changed a thing.

25:12.950 --> 25:14.246
St. Speroville.

25:14.281 --> 25:16.347
- Oh, bless you.

25:16.382 --> 25:18.415
- I mean she goes
to college there.

25:18.450 --> 25:20.087
- Oh, yeah.

25:20.122 --> 25:22.089
- She always wanted that.

25:22.124 --> 25:23.992
And she always went
for what she wanted.

25:24.027 --> 25:25.994
- Why don't you go?

25:26.029 --> 25:26.797
- Where?

25:26.832 --> 25:27.963
- To see Lyla.

25:27.998 --> 25:29.360
- By myself?

25:29.395 --> 25:30.966
- We'll go with you.

25:31.001 --> 25:34.640
Besides, not taking an
action is still an action.

25:37.876 --> 25:39.370
Are you really gonna
die without knowing

25:39.405 --> 25:43.616
why the best thing that
ever happened to you left?

25:45.048 --> 25:45.816
- Yeah.

25:46.984 --> 25:49.721
Okay, I guess we're doing this.

25:51.450 --> 25:53.450
- What is up, road trip?

25:54.420 --> 25:57.091
We're going on a road trip.

25:57.126 --> 26:00.160
We're going on a road trip.

26:00.195 --> 26:02.459
- Hey, I'm proud of you.

26:02.494 --> 26:03.196
- Thanks Kaitlyn.

26:03.231 --> 26:04.802
- Road trip, yay!

26:25.616 --> 26:26.483
- Hey.

26:26.518 --> 26:27.616
- That's a big bag.

26:27.651 --> 26:28.518
- Oh it is.

26:30.522 --> 26:32.159
I was gonna wait until
you came back from work

26:32.194 --> 26:33.259
to tell you but,

26:33.294 --> 26:36.196
I'm going on a little trip.

26:36.231 --> 26:37.263
- To where?

26:37.298 --> 26:38.968
- You know, the Grand Canyon.

26:39.003 --> 26:40.266
- Oh, I'm glad you're
feeling better,

26:40.301 --> 26:41.806
but you're coming back, right?

26:41.841 --> 26:43.632
- I'll only be gone
a few days, okay?

26:43.667 --> 26:47.141
- It's just you and me
against the world Mark.

26:47.176 --> 26:47.944
- Mom.

26:49.178 --> 26:50.408
- I'll miss you
.

26:50.443 --> 26:51.684
- I'll be back soon.

26:51.719 --> 26:54.049
- Mark, I miss you so much.

26:55.481 --> 26:56.887
- Mom, I'm here.

26:56.922 --> 26:58.988
- I miss you
baby, I'm right here.

26:59.023 --> 27:00.253
- Are you okay?
- Come back to me.

27:00.288 --> 27:01.287
- Mom.

27:03.324 --> 27:05.995
- Be safe and have some fun.

27:09.330 --> 27:10.835
- So then I told him,

27:10.870 --> 27:14.707
"She's not my wife,
she's my pet plant."

27:15.600 --> 27:16.401
I mean

27:19.406 --> 27:21.340
can you believe that?

27:21.375 --> 27:22.176
- I can't.

27:23.377 --> 27:27.016
Robin, you gotta
stop doing that, man.

27:27.051 --> 27:29.348
We weren't having
a conversation.

27:29.383 --> 27:31.757
I don't know what the
freak you're talking about.

27:31.792 --> 27:34.320
You just got here
and you, oh, you...

27:34.355 --> 27:36.124
Big buddy still told you.
- You get it.

27:36.159 --> 27:36.960
- I love your ass.

27:36.995 --> 27:38.159
All right, okay.

27:38.194 --> 27:39.732
You can stop, he's gonna come.

27:39.767 --> 27:41.195
Go ahead.

27:41.230 --> 27:42.559
Ah, yeah, okay.

27:43.804 --> 27:45.298
- You're just worrying
too much, it'll be fine.

27:45.333 --> 27:46.629
- Yeah, I am worried about him.

27:46.664 --> 27:48.037
- Ira, you're exaggerating.

27:48.072 --> 27:49.500
- But you see where
I'm coming from, right?

27:49.535 --> 27:51.238
- I mean, I guess
but it's just...

27:51.273 --> 27:53.702
- Plus, what if Lyla
doesn't wanna see Mark?

27:53.737 --> 27:55.407
What if Lyla got hit by a bus?

27:55.442 --> 27:58.047
What if we're setting our
friend up for failure, okay?

27:58.082 --> 27:59.081
- Hey Mark.

27:59.886 --> 28:01.215
You okay?

28:01.250 --> 28:02.711
- Yeah.

28:02.746 --> 28:04.680
Yeah, I'm fine.

28:04.715 --> 28:05.483
You ready to go?

28:05.518 --> 28:06.451
- Let's go.

28:09.797 --> 28:11.764
- No one grabbing
these, it's just on me?

28:11.799 --> 28:14.657
Okay, great.
- I got one, here, here.

28:14.692 --> 28:15.460
Let's go.

28:15.495 --> 28:17.627
Uh, it's a little heavy.

28:17.662 --> 28:19.431
- Why did you have
to park so much?

28:19.466 --> 28:20.201
- You know, just-

28:20.236 --> 28:21.532
- You're one man!

28:23.701 --> 28:25.470
I'm more man than you are.

28:25.505 --> 28:28.638
♪ I lose grip on the ground
always repeat myself ♪

28:28.673 --> 28:31.575

town on me, right?

28:40.487 --> 28:43.059
And she asked me, "Are you
gonna get, are you coming?"

28:43.094 --> 28:44.995
And I said, "Girl,
I'm not even close."

28:47.197 --> 28:48.493
- How far were you,

28:48.528 --> 28:51.265
I thought you said you
were in the same room.

28:51.300 --> 28:52.332
- Yeah.

28:52.367 --> 28:53.333
- He was on, they
were face talking.

28:59.605 --> 29:00.879
- Robin, Robin.
- Robin!

29:00.914 --> 29:03.409
- No, we're gonna
turn right now.

29:03.444 --> 29:05.708
Gus why else would you
have cruise control?

29:05.743 --> 29:08.381
- I don't have cruise control.

29:10.451 --> 29:12.825
- Preston please,
that map is dangerous.

29:12.860 --> 29:14.090
- Kaitlyn, Kaitlyn.

29:14.125 --> 29:15.388
- It's covering up the view.

29:15.423 --> 29:16.554
- I thought you could do better.

29:17.997 --> 29:20.063
- See, we're all good.

29:21.033 --> 29:22.032
- Oh my God.

29:26.071 --> 29:27.807
- Row, row, row, row.

29:30.768 --> 29:31.877
- Really?

29:31.912 --> 29:35.012
Dude, we got .

29:35.047 --> 29:37.443
- Get that crazy
in the car.

29:38.886 --> 29:41.381
- So Mark, are you
gonna play Lyla a song?

29:41.416 --> 29:44.780
- Yes, are you
gonna sing to her?

29:44.815 --> 29:46.452
- What? No.

29:46.487 --> 29:48.388
- You know you love singing
them cheesy ass love songs.

29:48.423 --> 29:51.556
♪ Lyla, Lyla is my girl ♪
- Guys, come on.

29:51.591 --> 29:53.525
You guys are such
dorks, stop it.

29:54.660 --> 29:56.264
Guys.

29:56.299 --> 30:00.334
- Oh yeah, the ones
with the repetitive lyrics.

30:08.509 --> 30:11.246
Okay guys, stop, okay?

30:11.281 --> 30:13.611
I don't do that anymore.

30:13.646 --> 30:16.119
- You love playing the
piano and singing, remember?

30:16.154 --> 30:17.747
- Well, not anymore.

30:23.524 --> 30:27.493
You guys really think
she doesn't wanna see me?

30:27.528 --> 30:28.967
- It's not that.

30:32.665 --> 30:34.632
- I don't think this whole
crusade is such a good idea.

30:34.667 --> 30:35.908
- Hold the hell on, okay?

30:35.943 --> 30:37.910
No, why was she not
wanna see my boy Mark?

30:37.945 --> 30:40.671
Man, she probably waiting
on you right now, okay?

30:42.708 --> 30:44.048
- Okay, look, honestly,
I'm just worried

30:44.083 --> 30:46.446
because don't you think
if she wanted to see you

30:46.481 --> 30:48.382
she would've reached
out to you by now?

30:51.057 --> 30:52.353
- I don't know.

30:53.653 --> 30:55.554
- Does anybody else hear that?

31:00.099 --> 31:01.659
- Oh my God.
- I can fix it.

31:01.694 --> 31:02.935
- No, you can't.

31:02.970 --> 31:04.695
- You don't know that.

31:04.730 --> 31:06.829
- Okay, so fix it.

31:06.864 --> 31:08.831
- See, now I don't
want to anymore.

31:08.866 --> 31:10.569
- Do you guys have any
signal on your phone?

31:10.604 --> 31:12.571
- I don't.
- Enjoy your chips

31:12.606 --> 31:14.144
- You want a chip?
- No, I don't want a chip.

31:14.179 --> 31:15.145
- You okay?

31:16.577 --> 31:17.840
- Okay.

31:21.120 --> 31:23.846
- Hey Goldman, this
conversation is not over man.

31:23.881 --> 31:25.122
- Mark.

31:25.157 --> 31:26.387
- I think what I
was trying to say

31:26.422 --> 31:27.751
is that we know how
hurt you were last time

31:27.786 --> 31:29.621
and we just don't wanna see
you get heartbroken again.

31:29.656 --> 31:31.755
- Why didn't you guys
tell me this before?

31:31.790 --> 31:33.097
- Because, maybe we were afraid

31:33.132 --> 31:34.824
of you shutting
us all out again.

31:34.859 --> 31:35.924
- I'm afraid of lamps.

31:35.959 --> 31:37.365
- Do you guys know Lyla?

31:37.400 --> 31:38.795
You know she wouldn't
do this to me.

31:38.830 --> 31:40.698
- Do we, do we know Lyla?

31:40.733 --> 31:41.501
- I know her.

31:41.536 --> 31:42.799
- Yeah, you know her

31:42.834 --> 31:44.075
because you guys
started hanging out

31:44.110 --> 31:45.703
once they started dating,
but me, not so much.

31:45.738 --> 31:48.541
In fact, I'm not sure what
the fuss is about this girl.

31:48.576 --> 31:50.609
- Is that what this
is all about Ira?

31:50.644 --> 31:51.874
Look, maybe Lyla and I

31:51.909 --> 31:53.546
didn't hang out with
you for a reason.

31:53.581 --> 31:54.844
- What's that supposed to mean?

31:54.879 --> 31:55.746
- Hmm, I don't know,
how do I put this?

31:55.781 --> 31:57.385
When I was with Lyla,

31:57.420 --> 31:58.749
I didn't like it when the fun
was sucked out of the room.

31:58.784 --> 32:00.751
- Oh!
- Oh, okay.

32:00.786 --> 32:01.785
- He didn't mean that.

32:01.820 --> 32:02.918
- Oh no, I think he did.

32:02.953 --> 32:05.426
You know what Mark, it's
called being objective.

32:05.461 --> 32:07.362
Maybe if you didn't run away

32:07.397 --> 32:09.793
from every challenge
that came your way,

32:09.828 --> 32:11.432
I wouldn't have to suck
the fun out of the room.

32:11.467 --> 32:12.763
- Damn.
- You're are literally

32:12.798 --> 32:14.303
always looking for an
excuse to get into a fight.

32:14.338 --> 32:15.535
- True.

32:15.570 --> 32:17.240
- And you are looking
for every excuse

32:17.275 --> 32:18.637
to run away from a fight.

32:18.672 --> 32:19.902
- Also accurate.

32:19.937 --> 32:20.804
- You just started
this fight just now.

32:20.839 --> 32:22.410
- You're not wrong.
- Shut up!

32:22.445 --> 32:24.544
- Mark, she left you man!

32:25.811 --> 32:27.448
Any normal person would rarely

32:27.483 --> 32:30.748
just hang their head low
for a week and then move on.

32:30.783 --> 32:33.487
If you wanted to, if
you really wanted to,

32:33.522 --> 32:36.952
you would sit down and you
would push through this pain.

32:36.987 --> 32:39.394
Not chase her girl
halfway across America.

32:39.429 --> 32:42.793
- Guys, we all
remember her, okay?

32:42.828 --> 32:45.037
We all remember how
good she was to Mark,

32:45.072 --> 32:46.863
to all of us really?

32:46.898 --> 32:50.867
Who can forget how silky
her hair was after a shower,

32:50.902 --> 32:53.705
or how much she enjoyed
having her belly tickled.

32:53.740 --> 32:57.280
Who can forget how loyal
she was for her breed.

32:57.315 --> 32:59.777
But dogs don't live forever.

32:59.812 --> 33:01.779
We have to move on.

33:01.814 --> 33:03.946
- How's that related to Lyla?

33:03.981 --> 33:05.750
- Who's Lyla?

33:05.785 --> 33:09.028
- I vote we never
let him speak again.

33:14.398 --> 33:16.827
- Oh, by the way I would
have handled that better,

33:16.862 --> 33:18.103
just so you know.

33:19.029 --> 33:19.896
- Walk.
- Titty.

33:25.541 --> 33:28.344
- Sorry, this is
such a shit show.

33:31.778 --> 33:35.912
- Speaking out
of curiosity, how's Mark.

33:40.919 --> 33:42.259
- I don't wanna be here.
- Listen,

33:42.294 --> 33:43.887
Mark knows where he's going,

33:43.922 --> 33:46.560
he knows how to find
this girl, okay?

33:46.595 --> 33:49.200
- This is not my
favorite moment ever.

33:49.235 --> 33:51.994
- Careful guys, stay away
from the road please.

33:54.867 --> 33:56.570
My feet hurt, do your feet hurt?

33:56.605 --> 33:58.000
- What are you doing?

33:58.035 --> 34:00.706
- Hang on, I'm
gonna get this one.

34:00.741 --> 34:01.509
- Mark?

34:01.544 --> 34:02.312
- Hello?

34:02.347 --> 34:03.643
- Do the running man.

34:03.678 --> 34:04.908
- Hello?

34:04.943 --> 34:06.778
- Get your silly ass
out of the street.

34:06.813 --> 34:08.945
A car is gonna hit you man.

34:09.783 --> 34:10.782
- Yes, he saw me.

34:10.817 --> 34:12.586
Yes! Hello over here.

34:13.424 --> 34:14.654
Wait!

34:22.532 --> 34:24.169
- What the frack
is your problem?

34:24.204 --> 34:25.093
- Dr. Cobb?

34:25.128 --> 34:26.138
- What?

34:26.173 --> 34:27.667
- Dr. Cobb, it's me, Mark.

34:27.702 --> 34:29.174
- Is he insane?

34:29.209 --> 34:30.703
Did he just get
out of an asylum?

34:30.738 --> 34:31.968
Is that it?

34:32.003 --> 34:33.178
I could have killed.

34:33.213 --> 34:34.146
- Dr. Cobb.

34:34.181 --> 34:35.004
- Why are you saying that?

34:35.039 --> 34:36.709
That is not my name.

34:36.744 --> 34:39.217
Have you ever been outside?

34:39.252 --> 34:41.417
Do you know how close you
were to getting killed,

34:41.452 --> 34:42.220
you psychopath?

34:42.255 --> 34:43.848
- Hey, shut up.

34:43.883 --> 34:46.048
Nobody calls my friend a
psychopath other than me.

34:46.083 --> 34:48.050
Hey, have you ever been outside?

34:48.085 --> 34:49.821
You could have been
killed you psychopath.

34:49.856 --> 34:52.791
- Excuse ma'am, is there
any way you could possibly-

34:52.826 --> 34:53.627
- No.

34:58.799 --> 35:00.370
- Leave it up to me?

35:01.835 --> 35:03.901
- Okay, I'm just gonna...

35:05.212 --> 35:07.212
- What the,
how you get into my car?

35:07.247 --> 35:08.708
- What's
your favorite color?

35:08.743 --> 35:10.006
- Robin!

35:10.041 --> 35:11.106
- I guess you're right kid.

35:11.141 --> 35:12.382
I do love turtles,

35:12.417 --> 35:14.186
and I do not need a
freaking straw to drink.

35:14.221 --> 35:16.221
Not if it's gonna end
up with a turtle's nose.

35:16.256 --> 35:18.223
It was nice to
meet you my friend.

35:18.258 --> 35:20.753
- Thank you Murphy my friend.

35:31.304 --> 35:32.930
- Thank you so
much for helping me

35:32.965 --> 35:34.162
in this little mission of mine.

35:34.197 --> 35:36.637
- Look kid, there's
something you need to know.

35:36.672 --> 35:38.672
You're gonna fail, hard,

35:39.576 --> 35:41.510
like really, really hard.

35:41.545 --> 35:42.478
- Okay.

35:42.513 --> 35:44.348
- And you're gonna keep failing

35:44.383 --> 35:45.712
until one day
you're gonna wake up

35:45.747 --> 35:47.912
and suddenly feel
like a new man.

35:47.947 --> 35:51.949
And then, and only then,
you will fail again.

35:51.984 --> 35:53.390
But it's gonna be okay.

35:53.425 --> 35:55.260
You're gonna realize it's
not the end of the world.

35:55.295 --> 35:57.229
You will survive.

35:57.264 --> 35:59.121
And if you're not
a complete moron,

35:59.156 --> 36:01.332
you will learn
something from it.

36:01.367 --> 36:02.366
So chill out okay?

36:02.401 --> 36:03.664
- Noted.

36:03.699 --> 36:04.467
Thank you.

36:04.502 --> 36:05.831
- You're welcome.

36:13.610 --> 36:16.347
- Ira, are you coming?

36:16.382 --> 36:17.513
- Where are we even?

36:17.548 --> 36:20.175
- We are at Paradise motel, see.

36:25.688 --> 36:27.490
Oh, it could be worse.

36:29.824 --> 36:30.988
- Oh, the smell.

36:31.023 --> 36:33.496
- Thieves are sharing!

36:37.062 --> 36:38.963
- It just got worse.

36:39.801 --> 36:41.636
- Not really.

36:41.671 --> 36:44.573
- Oh, we're not
even gonna be safe?

37:05.662 --> 37:07.926
- Found you.

37:07.961 --> 37:10.159
- Always do, okay?

37:10.194 --> 37:11.600
- I will, I promise.

37:17.443 --> 37:18.200
Robin!

37:19.907 --> 37:21.511
What are you doing?

37:21.546 --> 37:22.875
- I'm painting.

37:27.277 --> 37:28.452
Are you okay?

37:28.487 --> 37:29.552
- Yeah.

37:31.721 --> 37:32.984
Do you like it?

37:35.153 --> 37:39.958
- It's
actually really good.

37:44.129 --> 37:46.371
- Hey, so, do you
still write songs?

37:46.406 --> 37:47.999
- What?

37:48.034 --> 37:48.604
- Did you ever finish
that one you were writing?

37:51.873 --> 37:52.674
- No.

37:54.205 --> 37:55.006
- Why not?

37:56.944 --> 37:58.273
- I don't know.

37:59.584 --> 38:02.079
- How could you not know?

38:02.114 --> 38:04.587
- I...

38:04.622 --> 38:06.655
People change Robin.

38:06.690 --> 38:10.021
I don't have time to
write like before.

38:12.663 --> 38:13.662
- Of course.

38:16.535 --> 38:20.031
- Lyla and I broke up
before I could finish it.

38:24.169 --> 38:27.511
- It's good to have
you back, Mark.

38:27.546 --> 38:28.842
- Thanks Robin.

39:27.474 --> 39:28.231
Hi.

39:32.908 --> 39:33.709
Hello.

39:52.257 --> 39:54.532
Were can I find a mechanic.

40:15.115 --> 40:16.686
I did it!

40:16.721 --> 40:18.523
We're getting out of here.

40:18.558 --> 40:19.755
- What'd you do?

40:19.790 --> 40:22.758
- It took me all night
but I finally found him,

40:22.793 --> 40:25.321
a mechanic that can help us.

40:25.356 --> 40:26.795
- You rock Mark.

40:26.830 --> 40:29.358
- Yeah man, you are the best.

40:30.229 --> 40:31.767
Is that my jacket?

40:31.802 --> 40:33.703
I know you're not
wearing my $400,

40:33.738 --> 40:36.673
82% linen, European
,

40:36.708 --> 40:38.576
hey, don't just throw
her around like that.

40:38.611 --> 40:40.138
She's not something
borrowed off the street.

40:40.173 --> 40:41.139
- Okay, come on guys.

40:41.174 --> 40:42.404
Let's get ready.

40:42.439 --> 40:43.977
- Sorry kids, I gotta
take it to the shop.

40:44.012 --> 40:45.682
It's gonna be two days
before you can use it.

40:45.717 --> 40:46.947
- Ah, you suck Mark.

40:46.982 --> 40:48.784
- Yeah Mark, you suck.

40:49.952 --> 40:53.657
Wait, you suck means
you rock, right?

40:53.692 --> 40:54.889
- I can fix it.

40:54.924 --> 40:57.056
- With all due respect
Preston, I don't think you can.

40:57.091 --> 41:01.093
- Guys, guys, please, can
we just, I need a second.

41:01.128 --> 41:02.831
- Is it beautiful
minding it again?

41:02.866 --> 41:04.536
Hey, hey, hey, hey Mark.

41:04.571 --> 41:06.428
Just offer the guy
some more money, okay?

41:06.463 --> 41:07.770
That always works.

41:07.805 --> 41:09.706
- Does it?
- Yes, I do it all the time.

41:09.741 --> 41:10.905
Just watch me, okay?

41:13.437 --> 41:14.502
What I want you to do,

41:14.537 --> 41:15.811
get some cash,

41:15.846 --> 41:17.241
put it in your palm,
close the palm,

41:17.276 --> 41:19.507
lock it up and then pimp
on over to him, right?

41:19.542 --> 41:20.409
Just like this.

41:20.444 --> 41:22.851
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

41:22.886 --> 41:24.347
Hey chief, what's going on?

41:24.382 --> 41:25.887
Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on,

41:25.922 --> 41:27.251
let's get in a hug,
bring it in, bring it in.

41:27.286 --> 41:29.154
Hey, so you see this little
car situation right here,

41:29.189 --> 41:30.122
did you pick the elbow?

41:30.157 --> 41:30.925
Did you?

41:30.960 --> 41:32.564
Yep.

41:32.599 --> 41:34.764
No you look like a turkey,
do it in a circular motion.

41:34.799 --> 41:36.029
That's cool, yes.

41:36.064 --> 41:37.327
Do you, this car situation,

41:37.362 --> 41:38.636
I need you to handle
that for me, okay?

41:38.671 --> 41:39.802
You do me a real solid,

41:39.837 --> 41:41.529
I got some big money for you,

41:41.564 --> 41:43.498
but you can take
care of this, okay?

41:43.533 --> 41:44.840
That's all you're gonna
do, just like that.

41:44.875 --> 41:46.974
- I don't know, that sounds
a little condescending.

41:47.009 --> 41:48.679
- I don't know, I don't
know if that's a good idea.

41:48.714 --> 41:50.747
- It's not condescending,
it is a good idea.

41:50.782 --> 41:52.177
Listen, I do this
all the time, okay?

41:52.212 --> 41:53.244
Look at me.

41:53.279 --> 41:54.443
Right?

41:54.478 --> 41:56.016
You can do this, okay?

41:56.051 --> 41:57.248
Look, he's right
there, all right?

41:57.283 --> 41:58.216
You got this.

41:58.251 --> 41:59.184
I don't care how big he is,

41:59.219 --> 42:00.889
he's not even that big.

42:00.924 --> 42:01.956
- You got this.

42:02.926 --> 42:03.958
- Lock it up, lock it up.

42:03.993 --> 42:05.091
- You miss 100% of the
chances you don't take.

42:05.126 --> 42:06.092
- Hey chief.

42:08.459 --> 42:10.899
Ah, so what's good in the hood?

42:15.136 --> 42:16.641
- Excuse me?

42:16.676 --> 42:18.907
- I mean, bring it in brother.

42:21.175 --> 42:22.680
Wow, you're solid.

42:22.715 --> 42:25.782
I mean, you'd be
doing us a real solid

42:25.817 --> 42:27.245
if we, if we could get this

42:27.280 --> 42:31.018
taken care of by
today, you know?

42:31.053 --> 42:33.823
I could pay you
good money for it.

42:34.958 --> 42:36.991
- Wait, you weren't
gonna pay me?

42:37.026 --> 42:38.927
- No, I mean, yes, of course.

42:38.962 --> 42:39.961
Of course I was gonna pay you.

42:39.996 --> 42:42.799
It's just, that's all I got.

42:42.834 --> 42:44.933
- It's gonna be way more
than two freaking dollars.

42:44.968 --> 42:47.364
- Two dollars, you
gave him two dollars?

42:47.399 --> 42:49.234
- Yes, yes, of course.

42:49.269 --> 42:51.643
It's just that right
now, that's what I got.

42:51.678 --> 42:53.172
We're on the road,

42:53.207 --> 42:57.143
I can stop by an ATM
and get more cash.

42:57.178 --> 42:59.442
But for now that would be it.

43:04.152 --> 43:06.152
- It'll be ready in three days.

43:06.187 --> 43:07.120
- Three?

43:07.155 --> 43:09.320
I thought you said two.

43:09.355 --> 43:12.697
- It'll be ready when
I say it's ready.

43:13.656 --> 43:14.996
- Okay.

43:15.031 --> 43:17.834
- What if
we scream really loud?

43:17.869 --> 43:21.332
- Look, I don't even
have any change .

43:21.367 --> 43:24.203
I mean, you can think all you...

43:25.206 --> 43:26.172
- Are you coming?

43:26.207 --> 43:27.844
- Do you know her.

43:27.879 --> 43:31.078
- Seriously Goldman,
that's my sister.

43:32.147 --> 43:33.916
- You are that Rebecca?

43:33.951 --> 43:35.247
- What are you doing here?

43:35.282 --> 43:37.216
- Bitch, you called me.

43:40.320 --> 43:43.090
- I didn't think you'd
actually show up.

43:43.125 --> 43:44.454
- Remember this?

43:44.489 --> 43:45.829
- Hi, okay, listen,
I know you're my sister,

43:45.864 --> 43:47.226
and I know that you hate me.

43:47.261 --> 43:51.032
But I'm at motel Paradise,
which clearly is ironic.

43:51.067 --> 43:53.034
Listen, okay, I'm pissed,
I'm just really mad,

43:53.069 --> 43:54.167
I'm going to break something,

43:54.202 --> 43:55.806
if you get this, just drive,

43:55.841 --> 43:58.237
just come to my location
and just get me, thank you.

43:58.272 --> 44:00.173
- You're welcome.

44:00.208 --> 44:01.812
- What do you guys even
doing here anyways?

44:01.847 --> 44:03.341
- We're in the middle of a trip.

44:03.376 --> 44:04.573
- Exciting.

44:04.608 --> 44:07.180
- Yeah, it was, until
my car broke down.

44:07.215 --> 44:08.181
- Sucks.

44:08.216 --> 44:09.545
You coming or not?

44:09.580 --> 44:11.250
- No, I slept on it, I'm good.

44:11.285 --> 44:12.251
You can go.

44:12.286 --> 44:15.254
- Wait, considering that
you're already here,

44:15.289 --> 44:16.651
is there any chance you
might wanna join us?

44:16.686 --> 44:17.619
- What are you doing?

44:17.654 --> 44:18.620
- Join us, please, let's go.

44:18.655 --> 44:20.160
- Stop talking to you guys.

44:20.195 --> 44:21.194
- Where are you guys going?

44:21.229 --> 44:23.031
- Ah, St. Speroville.

44:23.066 --> 44:24.428
It's a little town up the road.

44:24.463 --> 44:25.803
- Why would you
ever wanna go there?

44:25.838 --> 44:28.696
- We're looking for my girl...

44:28.731 --> 44:32.139
Well, we're gonna go
visit a friend of mine

44:32.174 --> 44:34.141
I wanna see one last time.

44:34.176 --> 44:35.978
And we just-

44:36.013 --> 44:37.639
- We're looking for Lyla Miller.

44:37.674 --> 44:39.245
- Hard pass for me.

44:39.280 --> 44:40.543
- You know her?

44:40.578 --> 44:42.281
- Not exactly her biggest fan.

44:42.316 --> 44:43.579
- You heard her well,
gotta let you go.

44:43.614 --> 44:44.855
Okay guys, let's go,
come on, let's go.

44:44.890 --> 44:45.988
- Look, look.

44:47.189 --> 44:49.827
If you help us, if
you give us a ride,

44:49.862 --> 44:51.356
I'll owe, big time.

44:52.964 --> 44:54.359
- Big time, huh?

45:58.964 --> 46:00.392
almost abandoned bar.

46:00.427 --> 46:02.625

you ever have a reason

46:04.332 --> 46:05.496

None of that.

46:21.547 --> 46:22.381
- We're good.

46:23.780 --> 46:26.286
- Does this place
even have a kitchen?

46:26.321 --> 46:29.091
- Don't worry Preston,
we're here for the food.

46:29.126 --> 46:30.653

46:30.688 --> 46:32.391

46:32.426 --> 46:33.964

probably the reason we're here.

46:35.396 --> 46:37.462
Also, how did she
get to us so fast?

46:37.497 --> 46:38.870

cut her some slack?

46:38.905 --> 46:40.696
Honestly, I don't see why
you guys don't get along.

46:40.731 --> 46:42.566
You're very similar.

46:45.076 --> 46:46.504

46:46.539 --> 46:47.637
- All I'm saying is that-

You know Mark, I know
you don't do it a lot,

46:55.449 --> 46:57.746
but there's a difference
between standing up for yourself

46:57.781 --> 47:00.419
and tearing other people down.

47:02.929 --> 47:07.129
- That feels like a lot
of exposition to me.

focused, okay?

57:41.358 --> 57:42.126
Let's find Lyla.

57:42.161 --> 57:43.600
- Hey!

57:43.635 --> 57:44.832
- Mark, run.

57:44.867 --> 57:47.637
Run, go, get out of here.

57:47.672 --> 57:49.364
I'll distract him, I won't
let him get you Mark.

57:49.399 --> 57:51.542
- Hi guys, wait, where'd Marco.

57:51.577 --> 57:54.006
Dennis knows Lyla,
he's here to help.

57:54.041 --> 57:54.974
- Yeah, your friend,

57:55.009 --> 57:57.911
she packs with me, right hook.

57:57.946 --> 58:00.617
- Yeah, no, I figured,
that was, that was my plan.

58:00.652 --> 58:01.783
The whole, the whole time.

58:01.818 --> 58:04.720
That plan for you
guys to be friends.

58:04.755 --> 58:05.886
Mark!

58:05.921 --> 58:07.019
- Mark!

58:11.454 --> 58:12.222
- Song writers?

58:17.196 --> 58:18.767
Traveling time?

58:39.955 --> 58:42.791
This place is amazing.

58:42.826 --> 58:43.792
Lyla.

58:47.699 --> 58:48.995
- Hey.

58:49.030 --> 58:50.293
- Hey, how was the test?

58:50.328 --> 58:51.701
- It was good.
- Good.

58:51.736 --> 58:52.867
Is that right, you
didn't need to study.

58:52.902 --> 58:55.738
- I wouldn't go that far.

58:59.007 --> 59:00.204
- Let's go, now.

59:01.339 --> 59:02.107
- Mark!

59:06.443 --> 59:08.883
Ah, what are you doing here?

59:12.086 --> 59:13.789
What's going on?

59:13.824 --> 59:15.989
- Hey babe, are
we gonna head out?

59:16.024 --> 59:17.122
- Just one second.

59:17.157 --> 59:18.926
- Oh yeah, no worries.

59:20.666 --> 59:25.702
It
was nice to see you Mark.

59:26.628 --> 59:27.869
- Was it?

59:27.904 --> 59:28.969
- Was it?

59:30.775 --> 59:31.565
- What?

59:32.876 --> 59:34.337
- If it was so nice,
why did you leave?

59:34.372 --> 59:35.569
- Oh Mark.

59:35.604 --> 59:37.241
- Do you really not
remember what happened?

59:37.276 --> 59:38.913
- I don't.

59:38.948 --> 59:40.508
So why don't you tell me?

59:40.543 --> 59:41.916
- Baby, maybe this
isn't the best place.

59:41.951 --> 59:43.346
- You left me for him?
- All right.

59:43.381 --> 59:45.282
- Don't.
- He's a douche bag, Lyla.

59:45.317 --> 59:46.547
- This has nothing-

59:46.582 --> 59:47.614
- He's the reason you
left me, isn't he?

59:47.649 --> 59:48.923
- You're doing it again,

59:48.958 --> 59:49.660
you're doing that
thing, you're just-

59:49.695 --> 59:51.189
- You never loved me.

59:53.963 --> 59:55.325
You never did.

59:55.360 --> 59:56.491
- How can you say that?

59:56.526 --> 59:58.295
- Love is not
supposed to change you

59:58.330 --> 1:00:00.770
or demand so much of you.

1:00:00.805 --> 1:00:03.036
I've come all this way and...

1:00:04.501 --> 1:00:06.072
Love is not supposed to run away

1:00:06.107 --> 1:00:08.536
whenever it has a chance.

1:00:08.571 --> 1:00:10.175
- If that's how you remember it,

1:00:10.210 --> 1:00:11.847
then I don't even know why
you drove all this way.

1:00:11.882 --> 1:00:15.950
- I'm just here to
say goodbye, for good.

1:00:15.985 --> 1:00:20.790
- This is not how I imagined
this conversation going.

1:00:20.825 --> 1:00:22.451
But if that's what you need,

1:00:22.486 --> 1:00:24.354
then goodbye, for good.

1:00:31.561 --> 1:00:34.804
This was the last
thing I ever wanted.

1:00:36.038 --> 1:00:39.039
- You're never gonna
see me again Lyla.

1:00:39.074 --> 1:00:42.042
- Well, then that
makes me really sad Mark.

1:00:47.445 --> 1:00:48.785
- I knew this was gonna happen.

1:00:48.820 --> 1:00:50.952
This is what I was
talking about you guys.

1:00:50.987 --> 1:00:52.448
We should have never come here.

1:01:10.237 --> 1:01:11.269
- Thanks a lot.

1:01:18.212 --> 1:01:19.541
You got to be kidding me.

1:01:35.295 --> 1:01:38.164
- What the freak Goldman!

1:01:38.199 --> 1:01:40.430
- Guys, please,
just leave me alone.

1:01:40.465 --> 1:01:42.036
- After everything
that we did for you,

1:01:42.071 --> 1:01:43.136
you just abandoned us.

1:01:43.171 --> 1:01:45.006
- Mark, I just, why?

1:01:46.339 --> 1:01:49.175
What'd you did back there,
that was not okay at all.

1:01:49.210 --> 1:01:52.277
- Ira, gonna say something?

1:01:52.312 --> 1:01:54.884
- Well, actually
I'm kind of torn.

1:01:54.919 --> 1:01:57.084
Man, I'm proud of you for
standing up for yourself.

1:01:57.119 --> 1:01:58.745
Even though you kind
of sucked at it.

1:01:58.780 --> 1:02:00.186
And freak dude, you left us.

1:02:00.221 --> 1:02:01.286
You left us!

1:02:01.321 --> 1:02:02.320
- You freaking left us.

1:02:02.355 --> 1:02:03.222
- Why did you do it Mark?
- Alone.

1:02:03.257 --> 1:02:04.487
- A friend should never.

1:02:04.522 --> 1:02:08.260
- Shut up for once in
your life, just shut up.

1:02:08.295 --> 1:02:09.525
- Calm down.

1:02:09.560 --> 1:02:10.933
- I listened to you guys,

1:02:10.968 --> 1:02:14.299
I put myself out there,
and look what happened.

1:02:14.334 --> 1:02:18.534
I only feel like this when I'm
with you guys and I'm done.

1:02:22.540 --> 1:02:24.210
- You hear this dude?

1:02:24.245 --> 1:02:25.244
You're done.

1:02:26.313 --> 1:02:29.380
Hey, you don't get to be done.

1:02:29.415 --> 1:02:31.217
See, you don't get
to blame us for this.

1:02:31.252 --> 1:02:32.416
I mean, you're the
one who lost sight

1:02:32.451 --> 1:02:33.989
of what really
matters, right Mark?

1:02:34.024 --> 1:02:35.089
Right Mark?

1:02:35.124 --> 1:02:35.892
Talk to me bro.

1:02:35.927 --> 1:02:37.124
Before this whole trip,

1:02:37.159 --> 1:02:38.323
when's the last
time you took action

1:02:38.358 --> 1:02:40.589
on something you
really cared about?

1:02:40.624 --> 1:02:42.426
'Cause you stopped
caring about school,

1:02:42.461 --> 1:02:44.428
you stopped caring about
your dreams, your health.

1:02:44.463 --> 1:02:45.660
- Stop it!

1:02:45.695 --> 1:02:49.004
- No, you became a numb
version of yourself.

1:02:49.039 --> 1:02:50.269
Look at you.

1:02:50.304 --> 1:02:52.304
You exiled us out Mark,

1:02:52.339 --> 1:02:54.845
that's why you're sick.

1:02:54.880 --> 1:02:55.879
You left us.

1:02:57.113 --> 1:02:58.640
And honestly, I'm
kind of embarrassed

1:02:58.675 --> 1:03:02.776
why I didn't see why Lyla to
let you in the first place,

1:03:02.811 --> 1:03:04.415
'cause why in the hell

1:03:04.450 --> 1:03:06.384
would she wanna be with a
man who gave up on himself?

1:03:06.419 --> 1:03:07.451
- Stop!

1:03:11.358 --> 1:03:12.830
What are you doing?

1:03:44.622 --> 1:03:46.292
- Hi, you've
reached the Goldman;'s,

1:03:46.327 --> 1:03:48.096
please leave us a
message, thanks.

1:03:49.363 --> 1:03:52.166
- Hey mom, this
trip was a mistake.

1:03:53.400 --> 1:03:54.938
I just wanna let you
know that I'm safe

1:03:54.973 --> 1:03:57.369
and I'll be home soon, okay?

1:03:59.175 --> 1:03:59.943
Okay, bye.

1:04:13.453 --> 1:04:15.321
I think it doesn't work

1:04:21.967 --> 1:04:24.858
Robin, I really don't feel
like watching TV right now.

1:04:24.893 --> 1:04:26.596
- It's a sad one.

1:04:26.631 --> 1:04:28.664
But a good one.

1:04:31.603 --> 1:04:32.767
- Oh, we did it.

1:04:34.507 --> 1:04:35.374
- Watch.

1:04:35.409 --> 1:04:36.738
- We're stepping out son.

1:04:36.773 --> 1:04:39.048
Can you imagine, we're gonna
meet so many new friends,

1:04:39.083 --> 1:04:41.281
and go new places,
and oh my God,

1:04:41.316 --> 1:04:43.349
we can totally make schedules

1:04:43.384 --> 1:04:47.452
where we don't even
have class on Friday.

1:04:47.487 --> 1:04:49.718
Wait, what's wrong.

1:04:49.753 --> 1:04:50.994
- Nothing.

1:04:51.029 --> 1:04:52.457
- Come on, Mark.

1:04:56.034 --> 1:04:57.825
- I think I'm gonna go
to the community one.

1:04:57.860 --> 1:04:59.761
- What, community one?

1:04:59.796 --> 1:05:02.302
Babe, you just got
into an amazing school

1:05:02.337 --> 1:05:03.897
with a music program,

1:05:03.932 --> 1:05:07.208
and you saw their
recording studio.

1:05:07.243 --> 1:05:09.639
- I can't leave my mom alone.

1:05:09.674 --> 1:05:11.344
Not after my dad.

1:05:11.379 --> 1:05:13.280
- Okay, I mean, yeah,
of course I get that,

1:05:13.315 --> 1:05:17.185
but it's not that far, and
you can call her every day

1:05:17.220 --> 1:05:19.187
and we can come back
for long weekends.

1:05:19.222 --> 1:05:20.452
- You know it's not the same.

1:05:20.487 --> 1:05:23.257
- There's always gonna
be an excuse, Mark.

1:05:23.292 --> 1:05:25.160
- I can't do this right now.

1:05:28.462 --> 1:05:32.365
- Hey, we are gonna figure
something out, okay?

1:05:33.896 --> 1:05:35.170
Come here.

1:05:43.246 --> 1:05:45.147
- There's another one.

1:05:45.182 --> 1:05:47.149
- It's your last chance.

1:05:50.253 --> 1:05:51.747
Come on.

1:06:09.305 --> 1:06:10.073
Mark.

1:06:20.085 --> 1:06:22.283
- What are you doing?

1:06:22.318 --> 1:06:23.548
Say something.

1:06:26.586 --> 1:06:27.354
Come on.

1:06:28.423 --> 1:06:30.093
Go with her.

1:06:30.128 --> 1:06:31.325
No, you idiot.

1:06:32.460 --> 1:06:33.261
You idiot.

1:07:07.330 --> 1:07:10.166
- She didn't leave you Mark.

1:07:10.201 --> 1:07:12.201
You left her by staying.

1:07:15.668 --> 1:07:17.866
- I don't wanna be
like this anymore.

1:07:17.901 --> 1:07:19.032
- Then don't.

1:07:20.574 --> 1:07:24.378
Living and just existing
are two different things.

1:07:26.283 --> 1:07:29.152
Right now, Mark,
you're not living.

1:07:32.982 --> 1:07:34.718
You're trapped

1:07:34.753 --> 1:07:37.952
in this little juice
box you've created,

1:07:39.329 --> 1:07:41.758
where you think you're safe,

1:07:42.827 --> 1:07:43.892
but you're not.

1:07:45.126 --> 1:07:47.335
And that is so, so boring.

1:07:52.738 --> 1:07:55.035
It doesn't meet you anywhere.

1:08:01.109 --> 1:08:05.122
Do you want to make a
fool out of yourself, man?

1:08:06.785 --> 1:08:08.587
We all love you, Mark,

1:08:10.360 --> 1:08:12.690
but for who you really are,

1:08:14.122 --> 1:08:16.826
not the safe version of you, ah!

1:08:22.064 --> 1:08:26.099
And believe me when I say
we're not going anywhere.

1:08:44.790 --> 1:08:47.164
I told you you would wear one.

1:08:56.164 --> 1:08:57.207
- Thanks Robin.

1:09:05.778 --> 1:09:07.547
- It goes with your eyes.

1:09:14.116 --> 1:09:17.260
- All right guys,
let's get on packets.

1:09:17.295 --> 1:09:19.658
Bring your suitcases on.

1:09:19.693 --> 1:09:21.429
Look at those muscles.

1:09:21.464 --> 1:09:22.859
- Yeah, yeah,
they're kind of big, huh?

1:09:22.894 --> 1:09:25.026
- Yeah, can
you put the big one in?

1:09:25.061 --> 1:09:27.028
- What?
- The big one first.

1:09:27.063 --> 1:09:28.931
- Preston, you
forgot your charger.

1:09:28.966 --> 1:09:30.163
- Well, can you grab it.
- Hey honey.

1:09:30.198 --> 1:09:32.506
- And stop quarreling.
- We can't take this with us.

1:09:32.541 --> 1:09:33.837
- Damn.
- No, this stays in the hotel.

1:09:33.872 --> 1:09:35.905
So what was here
before, we can't take.

1:09:35.940 --> 1:09:37.478
- What is he...
- Bt we paid for it.

1:09:37.513 --> 1:09:39.040
- No, no, no, we
paid for the night,

1:09:39.075 --> 1:09:41.075
but we just paid to stay there.

1:09:41.110 --> 1:09:43.110
- Study abroad event.

1:09:43.145 --> 1:09:45.288
- Robin, you really were
only gonna bring one shoe?

1:09:45.323 --> 1:09:46.949
- It was itchy.

1:09:46.984 --> 1:09:49.325
- Lyla.
- Do you wanna go, okay.

1:09:49.360 --> 1:09:50.392
- You can't
be a thief Robin.

1:09:50.427 --> 1:09:52.394
Robin, what is...

1:09:52.429 --> 1:09:55.188
You better grab
my toothbrush too.

1:09:56.466 --> 1:09:58.334
- Hey, bye butterflies?

1:09:59.832 --> 1:10:01.271
Let's go!

1:10:05.739 --> 1:10:06.936
I have to pee.

1:10:09.347 --> 1:10:12.579
- Not taking an
action is still an action.

1:10:12.614 --> 1:10:15.076
- You are looking
for every excuse

1:10:15.111 --> 1:10:16.880
to run away from a fight.

1:10:16.915 --> 1:10:18.354
- What's the
last time you took action

1:10:18.389 --> 1:10:20.455
on something you
really cared about?

1:10:20.490 --> 1:10:24.151
- You don't need to
make a fool out of yourself man.

1:10:25.495 --> 1:10:27.220
- Goldman, Goldman!
- What are you doing?

1:10:27.255 --> 1:10:28.496
- What are
you doing, Goldman?

1:10:28.531 --> 1:10:30.333
- Look, you guys
were right, okay?

1:10:30.368 --> 1:10:32.192
I screwed up, I'm sorry.

1:10:32.227 --> 1:10:36.163
- Goldman, we're not mad at
you 'cause you screwed up,

1:10:36.198 --> 1:10:39.342
we're mad at you
'cause you gave up.

1:10:39.377 --> 1:10:41.707
- Look, I need to tell Lyla
I'm sorry before I leave.

1:10:41.742 --> 1:10:43.676
I don't care if I make
a fool out of myself.

1:10:44.712 --> 1:10:45.942
I'm not giving up on myself.

1:10:47.418 --> 1:10:49.352
Even if I cry in
front of everybody.

1:10:49.387 --> 1:10:52.619
- Whoa, there's no
reason doing that man.

1:10:52.654 --> 1:10:55.281
You can just keep it
classic, keep it dumb,

1:10:55.316 --> 1:10:56.326
but I like where
you're going with it.

1:11:24.488 --> 1:11:26.884
- How are we gonna
get into this time?

1:11:26.919 --> 1:11:28.424
- I know someone that can help.

1:11:28.459 --> 1:11:30.217
♪ Don't look at me ♪

1:11:30.252 --> 1:11:31.790
♪ Don't look at me ♪

1:11:31.825 --> 1:11:33.561
♪ Don't look at me ♪

1:11:33.596 --> 1:11:36.498
♪ Don't look at me ♪

1:11:39.965 --> 1:11:41.195
- There she is.

1:11:41.230 --> 1:11:42.295
- Go get her Goldman.

1:11:42.330 --> 1:11:44.968
- Wait, I think I
have a better idea.

1:11:45.003 --> 1:11:46.299
Preston, please make sure

1:11:46.334 --> 1:11:48.642
that nobody at the party
interrupts me, okay?

1:11:48.677 --> 1:11:50.413
- Okay, interrupts what?

1:11:50.448 --> 1:11:53.207
- Just trust me, okay?

1:11:53.242 --> 1:11:54.175
- Yeah, yeah, good.

1:11:54.210 --> 1:11:56.111
Hey brother, man.

1:11:56.146 --> 1:11:57.948
- Girls, go find Lyla.

1:11:59.589 --> 1:12:00.918
- Okay Mark.

1:12:00.953 --> 1:12:03.217
- I am not loving this bossy
version of you, but okay.

1:12:03.252 --> 1:12:05.791
- Robin, I need to make
sure that the piano is tuned

1:12:05.826 --> 1:12:07.254
and that the mic
is working, okay?

1:12:07.289 --> 1:12:08.024
- Yes sir.

1:12:09.632 --> 1:12:11.797
- Who said two humans
can't have fun at a party?

1:12:11.832 --> 1:12:12.666
- Yes, yes.

1:12:14.472 --> 1:12:17.539
Oh, this bit should be
called "Mark Rocks",

1:12:17.574 --> 1:12:19.365
or "Back to Lyla."

1:12:19.400 --> 1:12:21.906
Ah, both of the have
great potential.

1:12:21.941 --> 1:12:23.072
Parkman and Robin.

1:12:23.107 --> 1:12:25.547
- Okay, just go, go, go.

1:12:35.658 --> 1:12:37.955
- Are you sure
you're ready, Mark?

1:12:37.990 --> 1:12:39.990
You don't wanna embarrass
yourself in front of her,

1:12:40.025 --> 1:12:44.357
have her last impression of you
be how lame you are, do you?

1:12:44.392 --> 1:12:46.535
It's just so weird, isn't it?

1:12:46.570 --> 1:12:49.131
It's kind of got a
weird vibe, you know.

1:12:49.166 --> 1:12:50.539
It's not the real deal,

1:12:50.574 --> 1:12:53.476
but you and I could
have fun here.

1:12:53.511 --> 1:12:55.577
I know things got a
little crazy before,

1:12:55.612 --> 1:12:56.578
I'm sorry about that.

1:12:56.613 --> 1:12:59.207
- Rebecca.
- She left you and I wouldn't.

1:12:59.242 --> 1:13:00.516
- Rebecca stop.

1:13:00.551 --> 1:13:02.518
- You can't just throw
me away like that.

1:13:02.553 --> 1:13:04.410
You need me Mark.

1:13:04.445 --> 1:13:06.247
You don't need them.

1:13:06.282 --> 1:13:07.589
You just need me.

1:13:08.526 --> 1:13:10.460
You need me Mark.

1:13:20.670 --> 1:13:23.539
- No, you got it wrong.

1:13:23.574 --> 1:13:26.575
I think you meant
to say you need me.

1:13:26.610 --> 1:13:29.644
You try to make me feel
like you understood me,

1:13:29.679 --> 1:13:30.612
but you don't.

1:13:32.715 --> 1:13:35.617
I'm done staying
in the same place.

1:13:43.352 --> 1:13:44.153
Hello?

1:13:45.794 --> 1:13:46.595
Hi.

1:13:54.836 --> 1:13:57.331
- You got this, Mark.

1:13:58.543 --> 1:14:00.103
- Come on.

1:14:04.076 --> 1:14:05.779
- I'm here because I,

1:14:10.786 --> 1:14:15.591
I do think that students should
take opportunities abroad.

1:14:17.595 --> 1:14:19.485
Okay, I have to
level with you guys.

1:14:19.520 --> 1:14:20.761
I'm not the type of guy

1:14:20.796 --> 1:14:22.125
who would take a chance
on a trip like this.

1:14:22.160 --> 1:14:25.326
I'm actually not even good
at taking chances in general.

1:14:25.361 --> 1:14:26.734
And that sucks.

1:14:29.706 --> 1:14:33.169
Or at least it did
before I met this event.

1:14:37.076 --> 1:14:39.747
Thanks to this specific event,

1:14:39.782 --> 1:14:41.881
I embarked on a crazy trip

1:14:41.916 --> 1:14:45.214
where I realized I wanted
to start taking chances,

1:14:45.249 --> 1:14:46.754
to be better.

1:14:46.789 --> 1:14:48.316
This event has always pushed me

1:14:48.351 --> 1:14:51.253
to be the best
version of myself.

1:14:51.288 --> 1:14:53.926
From the first time we kissed,

1:14:53.961 --> 1:14:54.828
to the first time we-

1:15:01.903 --> 1:15:04.332
But what I'm trying to say is,

1:15:04.367 --> 1:15:06.400
go on crazy trips.

1:15:06.435 --> 1:15:08.974
Not only for the places
you want to visit,

1:15:09.009 --> 1:15:11.537
but for the journey itself,

1:15:11.572 --> 1:15:14.914
because only then,
you learn something

1:15:14.949 --> 1:15:18.588
about the people who are
taking that journey with you.

1:15:18.623 --> 1:15:21.085
Only then you learn something

1:15:21.120 --> 1:15:23.989
you didn't know about yourself.

1:15:24.024 --> 1:15:25.485
Never give up on a dream

1:15:25.520 --> 1:15:27.729
just because of
how far away it is

1:15:27.764 --> 1:15:29.599
or how alone you feel,

1:15:29.634 --> 1:15:31.931
because you're not alone.

1:15:31.966 --> 1:15:32.998
And staying where you are

1:15:33.033 --> 1:15:35.132
doesn't bring that
dream any closer.

1:15:35.167 --> 1:15:37.607
And if you go on the
adventure full on,

1:15:37.642 --> 1:15:42.612
so many dreams you didn't even
know you had will come true.

1:15:43.846 --> 1:15:46.682
And by the end of it,
if you do it right,

1:15:46.717 --> 1:15:49.278
you will be able to say goodbye.

1:15:51.150 --> 1:15:52.479
At least I can.

1:15:53.955 --> 1:15:54.987
I finally can.

1:17:34.451 --> 1:17:35.285
- You did it.

1:17:35.320 --> 1:17:36.187
You did it.

1:17:39.863 --> 1:17:40.829
You did it man.

1:17:40.864 --> 1:17:43.161
- That was my favorite song.

1:17:43.196 --> 1:17:45.064
- That was kind of jeezy.

1:17:46.364 --> 1:17:49.002
- Wait guys, give me a minute.

1:17:53.503 --> 1:17:57.175
Look, I'm sorry will
never cover it, okay?

1:17:57.210 --> 1:18:00.244
I just, I should've
gone with you Lyla.

1:18:01.082 --> 1:18:03.610
I should've never let you go.

1:18:19.232 --> 1:18:23.036
This feels like a
much better goodbye.

1:18:23.071 --> 1:18:24.697
- Wait, why goodbye?

1:18:25.843 --> 1:18:26.600
Mark.

1:18:27.768 --> 1:18:28.877
Mark.

1:18:28.912 --> 1:18:29.669
Are you okay?

1:18:29.704 --> 1:18:30.670
Mark!

1:18:30.705 --> 1:18:32.144
- Stay with me man.

1:18:32.179 --> 1:18:32.914
- Get his legs up.

1:18:32.949 --> 1:18:34.014
- Stay with me, okay?

1:18:34.049 --> 1:18:34.916
- Come on Goldman.

1:18:34.951 --> 1:18:36.082
- Mark, what's happening?

1:18:36.117 --> 1:18:37.743
- Somebody get some help.

1:18:37.778 --> 1:18:38.920
- Hey, you guys.

1:18:38.955 --> 1:18:40.284
- You'll be fine, you hear me?

1:18:40.319 --> 1:18:42.550
- You're okay,
everything's gonna be okay.

1:18:42.585 --> 1:18:44.992
- You're an amazing
young man Mark.

1:18:47.755 --> 1:18:50.327
- You have my respect.

1:18:50.362 --> 1:18:51.966
- I love you guys.

1:18:52.001 --> 1:18:54.694
- Remember you're
my best friend.

1:19:00.669 --> 1:19:02.878
- The song was perfect.

1:19:02.913 --> 1:19:04.209
- Yeah, it was.

1:19:41.545 --> 1:19:43.677
You need to sleep.

1:19:43.712 --> 1:19:47.384
Look, I can't imagine
what you're going through,

1:19:47.419 --> 1:19:51.454
but it's serious sister,
you need to sleep.

1:19:51.489 --> 1:19:55.161
- I'm good, .

1:19:55.196 --> 1:19:55.997
- Mom.

1:19:57.627 --> 1:19:58.494
- Mark?

1:19:58.529 --> 1:20:00.628
I gotta go, I'll call you back.

1:20:02.170 --> 1:20:03.136
Nurse.

1:20:03.171 --> 1:20:04.368
Are you okay?

1:20:04.403 --> 1:20:05.369
- All right Mark.

1:20:05.404 --> 1:20:07.470
Try to relax, you're
okay, you're safe, okay?

1:20:07.505 --> 1:20:08.504
You're in the hospital.

1:20:08.539 --> 1:20:09.472
I'm a nurse, my name is Elliot.

1:20:09.507 --> 1:20:12.046
I'm gonna run a few tests, okay?

1:20:12.081 --> 1:20:13.883
Can you look at me?

1:20:13.918 --> 1:20:14.708
Great.

1:20:15.777 --> 1:20:17.920
Okay, can you look at my pen?

1:20:17.955 --> 1:20:19.086
- How are we doing here?

1:20:19.121 --> 1:20:20.021
- Oculus field tests are good

1:20:20.056 --> 1:20:21.484
as well as pupillary response.

1:20:21.519 --> 1:20:22.650
- Great.
- He's all yours.

1:20:22.685 --> 1:20:25.059
- Thank you Elliot.

1:20:25.094 --> 1:20:26.324
Hola Mark.

1:20:27.657 --> 1:20:28.590
- Mark, can you hear
me pressing your feet?

1:20:28.625 --> 1:20:30.460
Can you press back?

1:20:30.495 --> 1:20:31.494
- Wonderful.

1:20:32.794 --> 1:20:35.432
Can you tell me who you are?

1:20:35.467 --> 1:20:36.466
- I'm Mark Goldman.

1:20:36.501 --> 1:20:39.172
- And do you
recognize this woman?

1:20:39.207 --> 1:20:40.767
- Yes, she's my mom.

1:20:41.605 --> 1:20:44.012
- Where do you think you are.

1:20:44.047 --> 1:20:46.344
- Okay, what's going on?

1:20:46.379 --> 1:20:48.280
- You were involved
in an accident.

1:20:48.315 --> 1:20:49.545
- You hit an embankment.

1:20:52.253 --> 1:20:54.682
- Causing significant
brain swelling.

1:20:54.717 --> 1:20:57.058
You've just woken
up from a coma.

1:20:57.093 --> 1:20:59.423
It has been
approximately two weeks.

1:20:59.458 --> 1:21:00.391
- What?

1:21:00.426 --> 1:21:02.723
Wait, is everybody okay?

1:21:02.758 --> 1:21:05.495
- There was no other people
involved in the accident.

1:21:05.530 --> 1:21:09.037
- The MRI
results are clear.

1:21:09.072 --> 1:21:11.039
- We're just gonna keep you
here for a few more days,

1:21:11.074 --> 1:21:14.504
just for observation to
make sure, all right?

1:21:14.539 --> 1:21:15.571
- Thank you for doctor.

1:21:15.606 --> 1:21:16.803
- Of course.

1:21:16.838 --> 1:21:19.542
Elliot, .

1:21:19.577 --> 1:21:20.873
- Wait, that song.

1:21:22.448 --> 1:21:25.647
I kept hearing it
over and over again.

1:21:26.584 --> 1:21:28.419
It was always there.

1:21:29.521 --> 1:21:32.093
- The doctor said,
although it might not work,

1:21:32.128 --> 1:21:33.886
that it was a good idea

1:21:33.921 --> 1:21:38.330
to create soft stimulation
from the outside.

1:21:38.365 --> 1:21:41.564
I've been playing
it for you everyday.

1:21:42.534 --> 1:21:46.470
I even brought your
favorite blanket.

1:21:46.505 --> 1:21:48.406
- Was this after I
played a Speroville?

1:21:48.441 --> 1:21:49.572
- Speroville?

1:21:49.607 --> 1:21:51.145
- It must've been.

1:21:51.180 --> 1:21:52.641
Did my friends come along?

1:21:52.676 --> 1:21:54.445
- Your cousins came
a couple of times.

1:21:54.480 --> 1:21:56.414
- No, no, my friends.

1:21:57.912 --> 1:21:59.252
My gang.

1:21:59.287 --> 1:22:02.024
- Oh honey, I'm so
glad you're back.

1:22:04.655 --> 1:22:06.292
Oh God, thank you.

1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:21.043
Are you okay?

1:22:22.673 --> 1:22:23.771
- Yeah, yeah.

1:22:37.094 --> 1:22:37.851
Hi Bob.

1:22:43.397 --> 1:22:46.497
- Mark lunch is
ready, your favorite?

1:22:46.532 --> 1:22:48.334
- Yes, I'm coming mom.

1:23:17.992 --> 1:23:19.167
Where are you?

1:23:20.731 --> 1:23:22.137
Hey mom.

1:23:22.172 --> 1:23:23.699
- What are you doing?

1:23:23.734 --> 1:23:24.700
- Ah, nothing, just-

1:23:24.735 --> 1:23:27.208
- You're looking for
your dream friends, huh?

1:23:27.243 --> 1:23:28.968
- They're real, okay?

1:23:29.003 --> 1:23:30.871
I just need to find them.

1:23:30.906 --> 1:23:32.543
- Have you considered maybe-

1:23:32.578 --> 1:23:34.677
- Checking online? I have.

1:23:34.712 --> 1:23:36.778
I can't find the group chat
or any of their pictures.

1:23:36.813 --> 1:23:38.384
I don't know, it's weird.

1:23:38.419 --> 1:23:40.683
I used to have this
drawing somewhere.

1:23:40.718 --> 1:23:45.160
- I meant, have you thought
about talking to Dr. Nolan?

1:23:45.195 --> 1:23:49.725
- Mom, why would I talk
to my childhood therapist.

1:23:49.760 --> 1:23:51.760
You were there.

1:23:51.795 --> 1:23:52.761
It's crazy.

1:23:52.796 --> 1:23:55.203
- Isn't it interesting
how dreams work?

1:23:55.238 --> 1:23:56.369
- This was more
than that though.

1:23:56.404 --> 1:23:57.700
- Being in a coma

1:23:57.735 --> 1:24:01.066
allowed your brain to
work through some things.

1:24:01.101 --> 1:24:04.707
- It's just, it was
so real, you know.

1:24:04.742 --> 1:24:07.039
I had this amazing
group of friends,

1:24:07.074 --> 1:24:11.714
and I accomplished something
I was really proud of.

1:24:11.749 --> 1:24:14.222
- Do you wanna
tell them about it?

1:24:14.257 --> 1:24:16.587
- Why bother, they don't exist?

1:24:16.622 --> 1:24:17.918
I'm on my own.

1:24:17.953 --> 1:24:19.887
- You know, you can
be vulnerable here.

1:24:19.922 --> 1:24:21.790
This is a safe space.

1:24:24.861 --> 1:24:27.532
- Well, first there was Ira.

1:24:27.567 --> 1:24:29.534
She was a born fighter.

1:24:32.770 --> 1:24:36.574
But with the biggest
heart you can imagine.

1:24:36.609 --> 1:24:39.874
She taught me how to
stand up for myself.

1:24:39.909 --> 1:24:43.911
Kaitlyn was very optimistic
and surprisingly strong.

1:24:43.946 --> 1:24:46.782
Well, of course it takes
strength to choose to be kind.

1:24:46.817 --> 1:24:48.289
- I got this, okay?

1:24:49.820 --> 1:24:52.986
- She always kept
me kind and humble.

1:24:54.022 --> 1:24:55.890
Then there was Robin.

1:24:55.925 --> 1:24:59.762
Robin was my best friend
and my biggest fan.

1:24:59.797 --> 1:25:01.093
He loved my music.

1:25:01.128 --> 1:25:02.765
- Yeah Mark.

1:25:02.800 --> 1:25:05.031
- And encouraged me to not
take myself so seriously.

1:25:05.066 --> 1:25:06.868
And to just be myself.

1:25:08.003 --> 1:25:10.872
And finally, the
most fearless friend

1:25:10.907 --> 1:25:13.248
you could ever imagine.

1:25:13.283 --> 1:25:17.549
He made me feel like I
could accomplish anything.

1:25:17.584 --> 1:25:19.485
Ah, Preston.
- Preston?

1:25:20.983 --> 1:25:23.489
- Wait, how do you know them?

1:25:23.524 --> 1:25:25.986
- You introduced us.

1:25:26.021 --> 1:25:26.822
- I did?

1:25:27.792 --> 1:25:28.593
I did?

1:25:30.025 --> 1:25:31.695
- Hmm.

1:25:31.730 --> 1:25:36.095
When you dealt with your dad
leaving, by shutting down,

1:25:36.130 --> 1:25:39.065
we were identifying different
sides of your personality.

1:25:39.100 --> 1:25:40.506
And these friends
that you love so much

1:25:40.541 --> 1:25:42.376
are different sides of you.

1:25:42.411 --> 1:25:43.971
You were a kid,

1:25:44.006 --> 1:25:48.041
so I described them as the
decision makers in your head.

1:25:48.076 --> 1:25:49.449
But of course,

1:25:49.484 --> 1:25:52.419
it's a little more
complicated than that, right?

1:25:52.454 --> 1:25:56.984
You see, we all have different
traits that define us.

1:25:58.086 --> 1:26:00.592
That's how our
personalities are divided.

1:26:00.627 --> 1:26:03.089
Now, if I remember correctly...

1:26:08.162 --> 1:26:09.535
- Preston.

1:26:09.570 --> 1:26:11.669
- He is pride, of course.

1:26:13.167 --> 1:26:15.739
- Yeah, Kaitlyn.
- Kindness.

1:26:15.774 --> 1:26:17.510
You always thought
that Ira was anger,

1:26:17.545 --> 1:26:19.842
but really she was passion.

1:26:21.109 --> 1:26:23.175
- Was Robin something?

1:26:23.210 --> 1:26:26.717
- You called him a
spark of craziness.

1:26:26.752 --> 1:26:28.950
He represented creativity.

1:26:33.253 --> 1:26:35.088
- Wait.
- Self-destruction

1:26:36.960 --> 1:26:38.190
I wanted to let you know

1:26:38.225 --> 1:26:39.631
that there are some
personality traits

1:26:39.666 --> 1:26:42.634
that can be extremely
self-harming,

1:26:42.669 --> 1:26:46.066
no matter how fun or
sexy they might be.

1:26:47.377 --> 1:26:49.036
You were going through
some of that at the time,

1:26:49.071 --> 1:26:51.280
so I had you draw her too.

1:26:56.276 --> 1:27:00.080
It looks like you were connected
with them in your dream.

1:27:00.115 --> 1:27:03.116
- Yeah, they were
my lifelong friends.

1:27:07.254 --> 1:27:09.793
It doesn't matter anyway.

1:27:09.828 --> 1:27:12.598
It was just a beautiful dream.

1:27:12.633 --> 1:27:17.636
- Dreams can become real when
they change your life forever.

1:27:19.673 --> 1:27:22.740
- This will change
your life forever.

1:27:24.106 --> 1:27:26.348
I'm so proud of you.

1:27:26.383 --> 1:27:27.206
- Thanks mom.

1:27:29.276 --> 1:27:30.209
- I love you.
