"Good Girls"...

- Are we going
to lose this house?

00:05.106 --> 00:06.374
- No.
I mean, I don't know.

00:06.407 --> 00:08.276
- Nancy and I are
suing you for custody.

00:08.309 --> 00:09.610
- Can I have lunch money?

00:09.643 --> 00:12.213
- Those kids take it again?
Douchebags.

00:12.246 --> 00:13.414
- The drug that
you're talking about?

00:13.447 --> 00:15.116
Ten grand a month,
out of pocket.

00:15.149 --> 00:17.385
And I'm guessing
that may not be an option.

00:17.418 --> 00:18.752
- How much is in the vault?

00:18.786 --> 00:20.354
- 30 grand,
give or take.

00:20.388 --> 00:22.256
- So when do you wanna do this?

00:22.290 --> 00:25.126
- Ladies and gentlemen,
this is a robbery.

00:25.159 --> 00:27.661
- You know how fast
they're gonna lock you up?

00:27.695 --> 00:29.263

[glass clinks]

- He wants us to pick something
up for him in Canada.

00:33.701 --> 00:37.338
It's wrapping paper.
It's just wrapping paper.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.739
I just need to know
we're good.

00:38.772 --> 00:40.541
I'm gonna need
to hear you say it.

00:40.574 --> 00:41.775
- We're good.

00:41.809 --> 00:44.445
- Here's to going
back to normal life.

00:44.478 --> 00:45.679
- L'chaim to that.

00:45.713 --> 00:49.117
- So what'd you
wanna talk to me about?

00:50.551 --> 00:52.853
- Mom, mom, mom.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.622
It's not fair.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.557
For Tommy's birthday, we all
went out to a Pistons game.

00:56.590 --> 00:59.560
We got box seats, and his mom
bought us all jerseys.

00:59.593 --> 01:01.862
And then--
and then after that,

01:01.895 --> 01:03.564
they rented a hotel
with room service.

01:03.597 --> 01:06.400
- Yeah, and now Tommy's mom
can't afford college.

01:06.434 --> 01:08.169
- Well, I want
a birthday party.

01:08.202 --> 01:10.304
- How about a sleepover?
- With a chocolate fountain.

01:10.338 --> 01:12.273
- You could nuke a Hershey bar.
- Mama?

01:12.306 --> 01:13.707
- This is the worst
birthday ever.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.376
- Mama?

01:15.409 --> 01:16.644
- Listen, well, we can't just
afford a really big,

01:16.677 --> 01:18.146
fancy party right now.
We just can't.

01:18.179 --> 01:19.547
- Mama?

01:19.580 --> 01:21.715
- But I promise you,
I'm gonna make it special.

01:21.749 --> 01:22.883
I promise you, okay.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.319
- Mama!
- What is it?

01:25.353 --> 01:27.655
- Who's the man?
- What man?

01:27.688 --> 01:29.823
- The man on my bed.

don't wear it out.

a waitress here?

02:31.619 --> 02:32.920
- Excuse me?

has the best program?

[chuckling]

02:36.790 --> 02:38.259
- I'll check if we're hiring.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.293
- Do you have
to buy the uniform?

02:39.327 --> 02:40.761
'Cause that's some--

02:40.794 --> 02:42.730
I mean, that's some high
quality polyester right there.

02:42.763 --> 02:45.266
I mean, that would set me back,
what--ten bucks?

02:45.299 --> 02:47.635
- Ah [chuckles].

02:49.437 --> 02:51.405
- Just go make him
another one.

02:51.439 --> 02:54.242
He can't eat this now.

02:54.275 --> 02:56.877
Come on,
chop-chop, Ruby.

02:56.910 --> 03:00.214
- Is there a problem,
milkshake?

03:00.248 --> 03:01.482
- What'd you call me?

03:01.515 --> 03:03.551
- It's a trick I use
to remember orders.

03:03.584 --> 03:07.255
Since I didn't go to college
and my memory's not so great.

03:07.288 --> 03:09.323
You always order
that milkshake,

03:09.357 --> 03:10.558
which you never finish,

03:10.591 --> 03:12.560
so you can be sure
to leave my tip

03:12.593 --> 03:14.695
in the bottom
of your nasty ass cup.

03:14.728 --> 03:17.265
My two percent tip.

Three, if you're
feeling generous.

It's not the money that I mind.

I get it.

03:26.674 --> 03:28.376
I feel for you.

03:28.409 --> 03:31.712
But please, let me know if
there's anything that I can do

No? Well, then,

85 cents on the table,

I just got you these.

04:20.394 --> 04:22.496
You told me they were "lit AF."

04:22.530 --> 04:24.632

They fall down.

No way.

04:26.734 --> 04:29.770
I mean, you'd have
to really yank on them.

Hey, why are you so worried
about your pants falling down?

we'll buy you some belts.

Maybe something pink,
and pretty,

05:10.010 --> 05:12.346

alright, all right, all right.

you don't know?

from the grocery store

05:33.534 --> 05:34.968

just there.

05:35.002 --> 05:39.039

we don't need the money.

We all still need the money.

06:15.643 --> 06:17.144
that we would possibly,

if the circumstances
were right,

06:20.514 --> 06:22.616
pick up another load
of the fake cash.

It's paper.

06:27.020 --> 06:29.022
I mean, it's literally paper.

for criminal activity

he just go to his mom's?

a miscommunication.

and choose what you wanna do

09:24.798 --> 09:28.135
Or what?
- [exhales deeply]

09:45.085 --> 09:47.788

they crossed the border?

09:47.821 --> 09:49.690
- Wish I knew.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.124
I lost visual.

Gummy?

09:56.697 --> 09:59.166

09:59.199 --> 10:01.802
So, just so I got this,
okay, these women,

10:01.835 --> 10:03.704
they took a car--
- Stole.

10:03.737 --> 10:04.805
I mean, they stole a car.

10:04.838 --> 10:07.340
- And drove it over the border.

10:07.374 --> 10:10.911
- What's your gut say?

10:10.944 --> 10:12.813
- I mean, jeez.

- Mmm.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.300
- And the one
that works with you?

10:33.333 --> 10:35.836
- Oh, I mean, if anyone
got radicalized, it's her.

10:35.869 --> 10:36.937
[laughs]
- I bet.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.973
What's her name?
- Annie.

10:40.007 --> 10:43.010
- My Annie was a Paula.
She lived in my dorm.

10:43.043 --> 10:46.413
- What?
- Ah, we both loved Hoobastank.

10:46.446 --> 10:48.048
- Wait, hold on a second--
- But it didn't matter.

10:48.081 --> 10:49.717
I was stuck I the friend zone.
- No.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.151
- Just like you, right?
- No, that's not it at all,

10:51.184 --> 10:52.753
actually.
- You sure about that, Leslie?

10:52.786 --> 10:56.423
- They have committed crimes.
I can prove it.

10:56.456 --> 10:57.891
Well, I can't prove it.

10:57.925 --> 11:00.160
But I can.

11:00.193 --> 11:01.394
But I can't.

11:01.428 --> 11:04.164
I mean, I wa--I want to.
- I'll tell you what.

11:04.197 --> 11:06.166
I'll do a little digging, okay?

11:06.199 --> 11:08.001
But you gotta do
something for me too.

11:08.035 --> 11:09.369
- Name it.

11:09.402 --> 11:12.472
- Go to O'Brien's.
You know the bar on Birmingham?

11:12.505 --> 11:14.441
Have a couple of cocktails,

11:14.474 --> 11:18.145
and find yourself a nice girl.

11:18.178 --> 11:22.015
Preferably one
that's interested in you.

11:22.049 --> 11:23.183
- And you know
what they call it?

11:23.216 --> 11:25.152
- What?
- A sizzling skillet.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.387
It says sizzling right there
in the menu.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.521
What does that tell you?

11:28.555 --> 11:32.159
- Uh, that it might be hot?
- That it might be hot.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.995
- Might not wanna touch that.
- You think?

11:35.028 --> 11:36.429
And now they're threatening
to lawyer up.

11:36.463 --> 11:38.065
- What?

11:38.098 --> 11:41.501
What does Tony say?
- That I have to apologize.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.804
- Well, all right, then.

11:43.837 --> 11:45.338
- Why should I apologize?

11:45.372 --> 11:48.141
Because I didn't tell
that idiot that the boiling,

11:48.175 --> 11:50.443
bubbling, sizzling platter
in front of him

11:50.477 --> 11:52.312
might be hot?

11:52.345 --> 11:54.414
What's next, We start warning
people that their ice cream

11:54.447 --> 11:56.016
might have a bit
of a chill on it?

11:56.049 --> 11:57.918
Look out.
- Uh.

11:57.951 --> 12:00.420
You--you wanna know why?
- Yeah, why?

12:00.453 --> 12:03.023
- Oh, you--okay.

Come on, come here.

These little people.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.466
That's why you go back
in there and you suck it up.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.202
Think we're gonna have to put
next month's meds

12:15.235 --> 12:18.471
on four different
credit cards.

12:18.505 --> 12:20.040
- I know.

12:20.073 --> 12:24.344
- And even then,
we might not make it.

12:24.377 --> 12:26.814
- Stan, you should see
these kids.

12:26.847 --> 12:29.182
They come in there.

12:29.216 --> 12:31.484
They're so rude
and disrespectful

12:31.518 --> 12:33.954
and act like they're better
than everyone else.

12:33.987 --> 12:36.489
- Uh, you know I get
called Paul Blart, like,

12:36.523 --> 12:38.491
every single day, right?

12:38.525 --> 12:40.527
Paul Blart.
Mall cop.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.966
Now, but I take it,

12:45.999 --> 12:47.534
because at the end of the day,

12:47.567 --> 12:49.369
I got this to come home to.

Chill out with the cayenne.

13:00.047 --> 13:01.849

It's spicy.

13:11.058 --> 13:15.028
- [sighs] Thank you.
I'm so hungry.

13:15.062 --> 13:17.064
- Did you stay up
all last night?

13:17.097 --> 13:18.966
- I mean,
she stayed up all night.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.567
I slept next to her
like a baby.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.435
- Is he still out cold?

13:22.469 --> 13:26.173
- Um, maybe we need, like,
smelling salts or something.

13:26.206 --> 13:28.308
- Right, 'cause it's 1892.

13:28.341 --> 13:31.411

and bring 'em back.

all about the party

tell him we can't afford it.

his little face.

an Xbox or "Minecraft"

16:45.472 --> 16:47.340

I just finished talking to her.

19:02.342 --> 19:03.643
- Well, what the hell happened?

19:03.676 --> 19:05.378

in the face.

Well, thank God.

She punched a dude.

he deserved it.

of suspending her.

she punched him in the face?

19:18.791 --> 19:21.194
- N--no.

19:21.228 --> 19:23.663
- They pull her pants down.

19:23.696 --> 19:24.664
- What?

19:24.697 --> 19:26.499
- Yeah, in the cafeteria
in front of everybody.

- Yes.

Greg, what is wrong with you?
That just makes it worse.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.607
Trust me.
- Annie.

19:34.641 --> 19:37.677
- Greg, in ninth grade
my mom went to the principal

19:37.710 --> 19:39.912
because there was
a rumor about me

19:39.946 --> 19:45.452
involving a coat closet
and some over the pants--

19:45.485 --> 19:49.956
- I--I--remember.

19:49.989 --> 19:51.491
- You do?

19:51.524 --> 19:54.761
- [chuckles] Why do you
think I hung out with you?

19:54.794 --> 19:58.431
- Shut up.
Just don't say anything, okay?

19:58.465 --> 20:00.300
Please?
I will handle it.

I know.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.946
- He couldn't sleep last night.
He was in so much pain.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.015
Poor thing.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.417
It's a third-degree burn.

Isn't that right, Ruby?

20:27.360 --> 20:28.895
- That's right.

20:28.928 --> 20:31.764
- And she's so thankful for
this opportunity to apologize

20:31.798 --> 20:32.999
in person.
Isn't that right, Ruby?

20:33.032 --> 20:34.667
- That's right.

20:34.701 --> 20:36.703
- She's gonna have to say
a little bit more than that.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.471
- All due respect--
- I'm sorry.

20:38.505 --> 20:41.474
This woman was careless
and rude and hurt my son.

20:41.508 --> 20:42.475
- No--wait a minute.

20:42.509 --> 20:44.311
Your son hurt himself.

20:44.344 --> 20:48.748
- You went out of your way not
to warn him that plate was hot.

20:48.781 --> 20:49.982
- Are you for real?

20:50.016 --> 20:52.819
- Just say you're sorry.

She is sorry.

haven't heard it.

- It's not okay.

21:11.404 --> 21:14.040
That was completely insincere.
And kind of bitchy.

- That'd be nice.

21:18.545 --> 21:21.414

How was that?

understand basic human decency,

especially service people--

21:41.601 --> 21:42.802

so far up your ass

to blame everyone else

I'm sorry he's such
a punk-ass bitch

the friends you bring in here

22:03.690 --> 22:08.027

and as awful as you,

are our future,

at wholesale price.

I wanna do something nice.

we could start fresh.

in everything.

28:55.802 --> 28:57.136
- Nah, I don't think so.

28:57.169 --> 28:58.504
- You look so familiar.

28:58.537 --> 29:01.974
- Nah, just a friend
of the family.

29:02.008 --> 29:04.043
[chatter]

29:06.345 --> 29:08.848
- I'm coming.
Thank you so much.

29:15.087 --> 29:18.457
all: One, two, three,
atom bomb!

29:18.490 --> 29:20.927
Oh!
[laughter]

29:20.960 --> 29:23.229
One more time.
Let's go, come on.

29:23.262 --> 29:25.231
[laughter]

29:25.264 --> 29:26.933
- Okay, ready?

29:26.966 --> 29:28.167
All right, go.

29:28.200 --> 29:31.103
One, two...

29:31.137 --> 29:33.172
- Atom bomb.

29:33.205 --> 29:34.874
- Mmm.

29:38.477 --> 29:40.146
- Hope you didn't
pop the bounce house,

29:40.179 --> 29:42.081
'cause I gotta return that.

29:42.114 --> 29:45.351
- That thing is awesome.

29:45.384 --> 29:48.454
[clears throat]
So...

29:48.487 --> 29:51.357
who's your new friend?

29:51.390 --> 29:55.094
- What?

29:55.127 --> 29:57.930
- You know, the guy
with the throat tats.

29:59.465 --> 30:02.201
- Oh, he dropped off
the bounce house.

30:02.234 --> 30:04.470
- Hmm, you were fighting
with the bounce house guy

30:04.503 --> 30:07.840
in our bedroom?

30:07.874 --> 30:09.408
- It's really none
of your business.

30:09.441 --> 30:11.543
- Emma says he sleeps over.

30:11.577 --> 30:13.412
- Oh, well, Emma also
thinks the Easter Bunny

30:13.445 --> 30:14.947
sleeps in her closet, so...

30:14.981 --> 30:16.983
- Is he the reason
you're not wearing your ring?

30:17.016 --> 30:19.418
- Oh, my God.
- What? I have a right to know.

30:19.451 --> 30:21.220
- You lost your right

30:21.253 --> 30:24.390
when you stuck your penis
in your secretary.

30:24.423 --> 30:25.958
- Come on.
- I want you out.

30:25.992 --> 30:27.526
- What?
- Yeah, I want you gone now.

30:27.559 --> 30:29.228
- No, it's Kenny's
birthday party.

30:29.261 --> 30:32.464
- Kenny's birthday party is
over, and I am exhausted,

30:32.498 --> 30:34.133
and I would like to put
the kids to bed.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.468
- It's my house too, Beth.
- The hell it is.

30:36.502 --> 30:37.937
- And you're still my wife,
so...

30:37.970 --> 30:40.873
- Yeah.
I gotta get on that.

30:40.907 --> 30:42.241
- Oh, yeah?
What does that mean?

30:42.274 --> 30:45.177
- What do you think it means?

30:45.211 --> 30:47.146
- Hey, you guys,
it's time to come in.

30:47.179 --> 30:48.915
- Beth, please.
- Guys, time for bed.

30:48.948 --> 30:50.549
- Can we just sit down
and talk for a second?

30:50.582 --> 30:52.885
- I don't have
anything to say.

30:52.919 --> 30:54.320
Guys!
- Just wait.

30:54.353 --> 30:56.255
- What, Dean?
What?

30:56.288 --> 30:59.125
- I just--
- What?

31:00.626 --> 31:02.895
- I have cancer.

31:05.231 --> 31:06.565
[laughter]

31:06.598 --> 31:08.467
children: Atom bomb!

31:08.500 --> 31:10.569
- Atom bomb, atom bomb.

31:19.611 --> 31:19.979
.

31:20.012 --> 31:20.679
- What am I gonna
tell the kids?

31:22.982 --> 31:25.551
- I don't know.

31:25.584 --> 31:28.387
- How are we gonna
pay for it?

31:28.420 --> 31:30.489
- I don't know.

31:30.522 --> 31:33.625
- What if he's really,
really sick?

31:33.659 --> 31:36.062
[whimpers]

31:36.095 --> 31:37.997
- We'll get
through it together.

31:38.030 --> 31:40.232
- How do you know that?

31:40.266 --> 31:43.970
- 'Cause we always do.

31:44.003 --> 31:46.372
- When did life become
this big monster

31:46.405 --> 31:49.241
that we just have to
constantly feed?

31:49.275 --> 31:51.510
- All right there,
little Nietzsche,

31:51.543 --> 31:53.679
go back to sleep, okay?

31:53.712 --> 31:56.382
- I can't, I have to return
all that stuff.

31:56.415 --> 31:58.951
- Don't worry about that.
I'll do it.

31:58.985 --> 32:00.452
Where's the receipt?

32:00.486 --> 32:04.523
- In my purse.
- Okay.

32:04.556 --> 32:07.093
- I can't believe I spent
ten grand on a party.

32:07.126 --> 32:08.560
- [chuckles]

32:08.594 --> 32:12.531
Did you see that
little kid's face?

32:12.564 --> 32:15.501
You're an amazing,
amazing mother.

32:17.436 --> 32:19.605
- So are you.

32:19.638 --> 32:21.707
- Besides, all that stuff
is getting returned,

32:21.740 --> 32:24.110
so it doesn't matter.

32:24.143 --> 32:25.711
- [sniffles]

32:25.744 --> 32:28.714
[pensive music]

32:28.747 --> 32:34.486
*

32:34.520 --> 32:36.055
- Can you make breakfast?

32:36.088 --> 32:39.558
- Hmm, well, that depends.
What'd you have in mind?

32:39.591 --> 32:42.294
- My mommy usually
makes crepes.

32:42.328 --> 32:44.997
- Well, Auntie's
specialty is cereal.

32:45.031 --> 32:47.299
Mmm.

32:47.333 --> 32:49.168
Hey, go inside
really quick, okay?

32:49.201 --> 32:51.570
I'll be right there.
Go on.

32:55.274 --> 32:57.343
- Yo.

33:00.579 --> 33:02.481
Thanks for loaning me the whip.

33:02.514 --> 33:05.484
- What did you do to it?

33:05.517 --> 33:07.319
- Yeah, sorry about that.

33:07.353 --> 33:09.155
- My sister drives that
to carpool

33:09.188 --> 33:11.590
- I filled up the tank.

33:11.623 --> 33:13.559
Things got a little out
of hand, so I mean,

33:13.592 --> 33:16.062
I owe you all some time,
for real.

33:21.533 --> 33:24.770
[upbeat music]

33:24.803 --> 33:26.272
*

33:26.305 --> 33:28.207
- Hey, do you need a ride?

33:28.240 --> 33:30.209
- * They say they coming for
you but I don't want none *

33:30.242 --> 33:31.777
* 'Cause I really
don't care... *

33:31.810 --> 33:33.479
- Get the pudding.

33:33.512 --> 33:36.082
Ooh.
- Ah.

33:36.115 --> 33:38.250
- * This may be communism
but I tell you this is mine *

33:38.284 --> 33:40.186
- Oh.
[chuckling]

33:40.219 --> 33:41.587
[indistinct chatter]

33:41.620 --> 33:43.655
- * What, what you've
been thinking *

33:43.689 --> 33:45.457
- Oh.

33:45.491 --> 33:46.825
- * I set it off

33:46.858 --> 33:50.429
* What, what you've
been thinking *

33:50.462 --> 33:53.099
- Yo, what's for lunch?

33:53.132 --> 33:57.536
*

33:57.569 --> 33:59.105
What you got?

33:59.138 --> 34:01.507
- Just, like,
a veggie medley?

34:01.540 --> 34:05.344
*

34:05.377 --> 34:08.114
- Mommy wants you
to lose a few, huh?

34:08.147 --> 34:11.450
*

34:11.483 --> 34:12.784
So which one of y'all
little bitches

34:12.818 --> 34:15.454
likes to pull
pants down?

34:15.487 --> 34:19.258
You?
How about you, Porky?

34:19.291 --> 34:21.693
I said, who is it?

34:21.727 --> 34:23.795
- Are you kidding?
- I'm sorry.

34:23.829 --> 34:26.365
- Here's how this is gonna go.

34:26.398 --> 34:27.799
You pull pants down ever again,

34:27.833 --> 34:30.802
I'm gonna break every bone
in your body.

34:30.836 --> 34:33.472
- [scoffs]
Yeah, right.

34:33.505 --> 34:35.807
Wait till he finds out
who my dad is.

34:35.841 --> 34:38.144
[grunts]

34:38.177 --> 34:40.612
[whimpers]

34:40.646 --> 34:43.282
- What was that
about your dad?

34:43.315 --> 34:46.752
I couldn't hear it over the
sound of your bones snapping.

34:46.785 --> 34:48.687
Next time it's your thumb.

34:48.720 --> 34:52.291
And you never
rat out your boy.

34:52.324 --> 34:54.793
Snitches get stitches.

34:54.826 --> 34:56.562
- * Now carry on

34:56.595 --> 34:59.231
*

35:01.900 --> 35:04.136
[door clanks]

35:07.339 --> 35:08.807
- Agent Turner.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.776
- Where you been?
I've missed you.

35:10.809 --> 35:12.711
- Oh, really?
- No, sarcasm.

35:12.744 --> 35:14.213
- Look, I just wanna
show you one thing.

35:14.246 --> 35:16.748
- Leslie--
- Will you just take a look?

35:16.782 --> 35:18.550
Okay, I saw this guy, okay?

35:18.584 --> 35:20.219
He was with the three
of them before.

35:20.252 --> 35:22.454
And saw him again yesterday.

35:22.488 --> 35:25.657
Whatever they're into,
he's involved.

35:28.327 --> 35:30.929
- Text it to me.
- Really?

35:30.962 --> 35:31.863
Okay, great.

35:31.897 --> 35:33.632
Um, uh, what's our next move?

35:33.665 --> 35:37.636
- Just text it, Leslie.
- I could go undercover.

35:37.669 --> 35:40.206
You know, I'm not afraid
to get my hands dirty.

35:40.239 --> 35:43.342
"Donnie Brasco"
is my favorite movie.

35:43.375 --> 35:46.345
[percussive music]

35:46.378 --> 35:53.585
*

36:01.393 --> 36:05.464
*

36:05.497 --> 36:08.267
- ...at the very core of
our democratic system is...

36:08.300 --> 36:10.636
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

36:10.669 --> 36:13.639
- I mean, it's kind of awesome.
- Yeah.

36:13.672 --> 36:15.874
- And then it does take
a pretty dark turn.

36:15.907 --> 36:19.545
- Yeah, believe me, I did not
know he was gonna do that.

36:19.578 --> 36:21.380
I just tried to scare him
a little bit.

36:21.413 --> 36:23.915
- Where did you find this guy?

36:23.949 --> 36:25.917
- Uh, at work.

36:25.951 --> 36:27.753
- So much for
background checks.

36:27.786 --> 36:29.821
- [chuckles]
Right?

36:29.855 --> 36:32.991
- Oh.

36:33.024 --> 36:35.794
- My opponent makes the point
that the electoral system

36:35.827 --> 36:38.530
of democracy negates the need
for civil disobedience,

36:38.564 --> 36:39.798
however...

36:39.831 --> 36:41.700
- I feel like she
really thinks she's in front

36:41.733 --> 36:43.569
of the Supreme Court right now.

36:43.602 --> 36:45.537
- Yeah, she's pretty amazing.

36:45.571 --> 36:46.938
- Duh.

36:46.972 --> 36:49.775
- Wait, wait,
where are the teachers?

36:49.808 --> 36:52.344
- Lucky for us,
apparently this school is, uh,

36:52.378 --> 36:53.945
pretty understaffed.

36:53.979 --> 36:57.283
- You know, at St. Anne's I bet
you they'd just expel a kid

36:57.316 --> 36:59.785
if he pulled
someone's pants down.

36:59.818 --> 37:02.388
- Yeah, and they also
use the Bible

37:02.421 --> 37:03.589
as their science textbook.

37:03.622 --> 37:06.758
- [sighs]

37:06.792 --> 37:08.860
- God, why do you
have to do that?

37:08.894 --> 37:10.996
- What?
- Just, like--

37:11.029 --> 37:13.565
You know, we were actually
having a nice moment.

37:13.599 --> 37:16.302
We were like vibing.
- Vibing?

37:16.335 --> 37:18.337
- Oh, I'm sorry,
we were "getting along."

37:18.370 --> 37:19.471
Whatever.

37:19.505 --> 37:20.606
Then you just say
something stupid

37:20.639 --> 37:21.607
and you ruin it
every time.

37:21.640 --> 37:23.309
- All right, I'm sorry,

37:23.342 --> 37:24.676
I'm just saying that I feel
like she would be happier

37:24.710 --> 37:25.811
at a place like--

37:25.844 --> 37:27.613
- Yes, I know what you feel,
okay?

37:27.646 --> 37:29.581
You've made that abundantly
clear, thanks.

37:29.615 --> 37:31.583
- I'm not just talking
about her.

37:31.617 --> 37:34.286
- Oh--oh,
you're doing this for me?

37:34.320 --> 37:35.787
- You're killing yourself
trying to support her.

37:35.821 --> 37:37.489
- Oh, my God,
okay, you know what?

37:37.523 --> 37:38.890
I really appreciate it, Greg.

37:38.924 --> 37:40.726
Thank you so much
for looking out for me.

37:40.759 --> 37:42.294
That's just so
sweet of you.

37:42.328 --> 37:43.395
Just so you know,

37:43.429 --> 37:45.731
I have some pretty dope stuff
in the works right now.

37:45.764 --> 37:47.466
- [chuckles]
Yeah, like what?

37:47.499 --> 37:50.436
- Laugh it up,
you'll see.

37:59.378 --> 38:02.481
- * Good morning,
good morning *

38:02.514 --> 38:03.815
- Mom.

38:03.849 --> 38:05.851
- * We talked
the whole night through *

38:05.884 --> 38:09.421
* Good morning,
good morning to you *

38:09.455 --> 38:10.889
* Good morning

38:10.922 --> 38:13.992
- See, that's why they're gonna
put us in assisted living

38:14.025 --> 38:16.928
when we're old.

38:16.962 --> 38:17.896
- Okay.

38:17.929 --> 38:19.398
- Where you going, early bird?

38:19.431 --> 38:22.601
- Um, I picked up a few
extra shifts this week.

38:22.634 --> 38:23.669
- That's my girl.

38:23.702 --> 38:25.337
- Do you mind
holding it down?

38:25.371 --> 38:28.607
Probably be late a lot.
- Psh, I got these people.

38:28.640 --> 38:31.577
- Okay.
- Oh, hold on.

38:31.610 --> 38:32.811
- Oh, yeah.

38:32.844 --> 38:35.614
- I'm proud of you.
- For what?

38:35.647 --> 38:37.649
- Sucking it up.
I know it wasn't fun.

38:37.683 --> 38:40.619
- Oh, you know,
they go low, we go high.

38:40.652 --> 38:42.488
- [chuckles]
Bye, baby.

38:42.521 --> 38:43.822
- Bye.
- Okay.

38:43.855 --> 38:45.791
Guys, Mommy going.

38:45.824 --> 38:49.561
- Bye, babies.
both: Bye, Mom.

38:49.595 --> 38:52.564
[upbeat music]

38:52.598 --> 38:56.568
- We have
a business proposition.

38:56.602 --> 38:59.538
- Aw, you guys didn't
hit me up to do brunch?

38:59.571 --> 39:02.374
- To clean your fake money
without having to deal

39:02.408 --> 39:05.076
with drug dealers
or street people.

39:05.110 --> 39:08.447
- Street people?

39:08.480 --> 39:09.748
- I got a system.

39:09.781 --> 39:10.816
- It's a liability.

39:10.849 --> 39:12.083
- It gets the job done.

39:12.117 --> 39:16.422
- How'd your friend
get shot again?

39:16.455 --> 39:21.092
- What're you proposing?
- Let us do it right here.

39:21.126 --> 39:23.562
- You wanna clean
fake cash here?

39:23.595 --> 39:24.996
- Or any big box retailer.

39:25.030 --> 39:26.865
You know, Walmart, Costco.

39:26.898 --> 39:28.700
They have very generous
return policies.

39:28.734 --> 39:31.036
- And no one thinks twice
about a wife buying her husband

39:31.069 --> 39:34.973
a flat screen TV
or new tires for the minivan.

39:35.006 --> 39:36.975
- We trade it all in
for fresh cash.

39:37.008 --> 39:40.712
- Fake money in,
real money out.

39:40.746 --> 39:46.618
*

39:46.652 --> 39:49.488
- Y'all got it all
figured out, huh?

39:49.521 --> 39:50.656
What's in it for you?

39:50.689 --> 39:52.758
- 20% cut of the profit.

39:52.791 --> 39:54.893
- Oh, is that right?
[chuckles]

39:54.926 --> 39:56.695
There anything else
while we're at it?

39:56.728 --> 39:59.431
Y'all want health care?
Union breaks?

39:59.465 --> 40:00.832
- Just for the record,

40:00.866 --> 40:03.435
I'll never smuggle anything
up my butt.

40:03.469 --> 40:07.205
- I could be talked into it
if the compensation was

40:07.238 --> 40:08.974
appropriate--wait.
Where are you going?

40:09.007 --> 40:11.910
- Uh, I gotta go
buy a duvet cover.

40:11.943 --> 40:15.447
- Are you in or...?

40:15.481 --> 40:17.549
- We'll give it a try.

40:17.583 --> 40:21.887
- We're not here to try,
we're here to win, bitch.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.755
- Oh, my God.

40:23.789 --> 40:29.628

40:29.661 --> 40:31.763
- 10%.

40:31.797 --> 40:33.098
- 15.
- 12 1/2.

40:33.131 --> 40:36.768
- Okay, deal.
- Cool.

40:36.802 --> 40:39.137
I usually pay 30.

40:39.170 --> 40:43.041
- * I feel brand-new

40:43.074 --> 40:48.046
[keyboard clacks,
mouse clicks]

40:48.079 --> 40:51.783
- Hey, what're you doing?

40:51.817 --> 40:54.019
- Um...

40:54.052 --> 40:58.524
Just playing Dr. Google
and freaking myself out.

40:58.557 --> 41:00.191
- Yeah, maybe don't do that.

41:00.225 --> 41:01.627
- Yeah, right.

41:01.660 --> 41:03.194
- When will you know more?

41:03.228 --> 41:07.265
- I got a bunch of scans
and tests next week.

41:07.298 --> 41:09.000
- Okay.

41:09.034 --> 41:12.938
Well, I'll go with you.

41:12.971 --> 41:18.143
- You don't have to.
But that would be great.

41:18.176 --> 41:21.046
Um, hey,

41:21.079 --> 41:25.216
I just wanna say thanks
for letting me come home.

41:27.218 --> 41:28.920
- You're gonna be
okay in here?

41:28.954 --> 41:31.022
- Oh, yeah, totally.

41:31.056 --> 41:33.191
Kenny's psyched,
so am I.

41:33.224 --> 41:37.796
I get to sleep on the top bunk.

41:37.829 --> 41:40.165
- Uh, I--better go get that.

41:40.198 --> 41:41.567
- Yeah.

41:41.600 --> 41:45.571
Hey, Bethie.

41:45.604 --> 41:49.040
Don't worry,
I got this.

41:50.241 --> 41:52.277
- I know.

42:03.021 --> 42:05.991
[upbeat music]

42:06.024 --> 42:10.128
*

42:10.161 --> 42:12.063
- Hi, I'm looking
for Mrs. Boland.

42:12.097 --> 42:15.767
- That's me.
Can I help you?

42:15.801 --> 42:18.303
- I'm hoping you can.

42:18.336 --> 42:20.606

42:23.775 --> 42:24.075
