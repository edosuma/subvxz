- I'm a firm believer in karma.

04:08.320 --> 04:13.804
And I think this situation was attracted into
my life as a huge learning lesson for me...

04:13.880 --> 04:17.726
to grow and expand
as a spiritual human being.

04:18.880 --> 04:22.771
I want to lead a huge
charity organization.

04:22.840 --> 04:25.525
I want to lead a country
one day, for all I know.

04:29.840 --> 04:34.084
Girls, time to get up! Let's go!

04:37.520 --> 04:39.488
Come on, girls.

04:51.880 --> 04:56.249
Oh, my Lord.
You were so out of control last night.

04:56.320 --> 05:01.565
What about you?
You were all over that old manager guy.

05:02.640 --> 05:04.642
Girls!

05:04.720 --> 05:07.564
Time for your Adderall.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.802
What time did you guys
get home last night?

05:09.880 --> 05:13.043
- Uh, late.
- Mm-hmm?

05:13.120 --> 05:16.203
- And you know it's a school night.
- We know.

05:16.280 --> 05:19.363
Yeah? Okay.

05:19.440 --> 05:23.684
Well, let's do our morning prayer, okay?

05:23.800 --> 05:27.930
And then, at 8:00, we'll meet
in the living room for today's lesson.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.731
Okay? Does that sound good?

05:30.800 --> 05:33.167
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's go.

05:33.240 --> 05:36.005
Okay.

05:36.080 --> 05:40.529
My chief aim in life
is to continually strive...

05:40.600 --> 05:44.969
to be the best person that I can be
for the greater good of the planet...

05:45.040 --> 05:47.725
and everyone who walks on it.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.529
And so it is.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.568
- And so it is.
- Whoo!

06:11.800 --> 06:14.565

06:29.640 --> 06:31.802

- Who's that?

06:31.880 --> 06:33.609
- Yeah.
- Really.

06:34.320 --> 06:36.049
I told her.

06:36.120 --> 06:38.168
What did I tell you?

06:41.000 --> 06:42.490
Whatever.

06:42.560 --> 06:44.847
Take a seat.

06:49.920 --> 06:52.844
Soldier boy. No, he's just a soldier.

06:52.920 --> 06:55.685

06:55.760 --> 06:57.603

07:16.080 --> 07:18.526
He's the worst. He's a real perv.

07:18.600 --> 07:20.967
Oh, okay. I'll watch out. Thanks.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.771

07:28.160 --> 07:33.246
- But I was away for a year, so did home school.
- Bummer.

07:33.320 --> 07:35.766
How'd you end up in the dropout school?

07:35.840 --> 07:39.640
Well, I got kicked out of my last school
for having too many absences, so-

07:39.720 --> 07:42.803
You know. What about you?

07:42.880 --> 07:46.566

Yeah, and the shoes,
but she needs better hair extensions.

09:38.680 --> 09:40.603

09:43.800 --> 09:44.608
Wow.

09:44.680 --> 09:47.160
So, is your mom away a lot?

09:47.240 --> 09:49.402
Yeah, she goes on trips a lot for work.

09:49.480 --> 09:51.084
Oh, really? For what?

09:51.160 --> 09:54.050
She has a chain
of student tutoring centers.

09:54.120 --> 09:56.441
And you're at Indian Hills?

09:56.520 --> 09:58.682
I know. Exemplary student, right?

09:58.760 --> 10:00.762
So, what do your parents do?

10:00.840 --> 10:04.925
Well, my mom doesn't work, and my dad
works for a film distribution company.

10:05.040 --> 10:08.169
- Hmm.
- Yeah, they do a lot of work overseas and stuff, so-

10:08.240 --> 10:10.163
That's so cool. He's in the biz.

10:10.240 --> 10:13.608
Yeah, it's pretty cool. I mean,
I get to go to screenings and stuff, so-

10:13.680 --> 10:15.444
- Nice.
- Yeah.

10:17.120 --> 10:19.805
- Do you want to check some cars?
- What's that?

10:19.880 --> 10:21.723

10:49.160 --> 10:52.528

- I heard something.

10:57.880 --> 11:00.690
It's locked.
- Okay. Come on.

11:09.760 --> 11:11.762
It's locked too.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.009
Shit. it's open.

11:29.920 --> 11:32.241
- No way.
- Let's go.

11:32.320 --> 11:36.120
- That's crazy.
- I know. People leave 'em open with credit cards and cash.

11:36.200 --> 11:39.170
Look, Marc. We got, like, 400 bucks.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.765
Oh, yeah.

11:42.960 --> 11:44.962
<i>How did you meet Rebecca?</i>

11:45.040 --> 11:49.250
I met Rebecca in school after I'd
moved back and went to Indian Hills.

11:49.320 --> 11:52.051
Um, I went there
'cause I had a lot of absences.

11:52.120 --> 11:57.524
I didn't want to go to school. I had
a lot of self-loathing and anxiety issues.

11:57.600 --> 12:00.649
- I thought that I was ugly.
- You're not ugly.

12:00.720 --> 12:04.247
I know I'm not ugly. I just...

12:04.320 --> 12:08.564
I don't know. I never saw myself
as an A-list-looking guy.

12:08.640 --> 12:14.522
Um, but I went to Indian Hills
to learn and be with my peers.

12:14.600 --> 12:19.401
But I was always self-conscious that I wasn't,
you know, as good-looking as other people.

12:26.320 --> 12:28.926
Want a ride?

12:32.720 --> 12:34.688
Hey, where we going?

12:34.760 --> 12:36.808
Wherever we want.

12:36.880 --> 12:38.769
- Okay.

12:39.840 --> 12:42.286
Do you know anybody that's out of town?

12:42.360 --> 12:43.930
Um...

12:44.000 --> 12:48.164
Yeah, this kid Evan.
His family went to Jamaica. Why?

12:48.240 --> 12:51.289
I went into an unlocked house
a few weeks ago...

12:51.360 --> 12:54.284
- found a bunch of cash.
- Oh, shit.

12:54.360 --> 12:57.330
- Where does Evan live?
- Woodland Hills.

12:58.080 --> 13:00.606
How well do you know Evan?

13:00.680 --> 13:03.729
I mean, we met up a few times.

13:03.800 --> 13:06.121
He's pretty hot.

13:27.280 --> 13:29.282
It's a nice place.

13:38.080 --> 13:40.003
Fuck. We need to get out of here.

13:40.080 --> 13:43.084

14:25.400 --> 14:27.562

14:36.560 --> 14:38.688
I think we need to get out of here.

14:42.920 --> 14:44.684
Oh, yeah.

14:44.760 --> 14:46.762

14:48.400 --> 14:49.890

18:15.360 --> 18:17.601
- You guys have everything you need?

18:17.680 --> 18:20.889
Hey, Nicki. There's some photographers
out here for fashion week.

18:20.960 --> 18:23.167
- I think you might want to meet them.
- For sure.

18:23.240 --> 18:27.370
And we got some huge music manager coming,
some executive producer from Entourage.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.807
It's gonna be a real party salad

18:29.920 --> 18:32.446

20:06.840 --> 20:10.162
Oh, you're the best. I love your shirt.

20:10.240 --> 20:12.686

20:12.760 --> 20:14.728
I'll see you later, okay?

20:17.120 --> 20:19.407

20:28.000 --> 20:30.128
<i>I loved her almost like a sister.</i>

20:30.200 --> 20:32.521
<i>That's what made this situation so hard.</i>

20:42.480 --> 20:47.088
Okay, this morning's lesson
is on character development.

20:47.160 --> 20:51.609
So in The Secret,
we talk about the law of attraction...

20:51.680 --> 20:56.971
and how we need to be really careful
about who we surround ourselves with...

20:57.040 --> 21:01.204
because we wind up being
the average of those people.

21:01.320 --> 21:04.369
So we are going to make vision boards...

21:04.440 --> 21:07.569
about people who are
demonstrating good character...

21:07.640 --> 21:09.449
like Angelina Jolie.

21:11.200 --> 21:16.491
So, what qualities do you guys
admire about Angelina Jolie?

21:16.560 --> 21:18.289
Her husband.

21:18.360 --> 21:21.170
- Mm-hmm. Okay.

21:21.240 --> 21:23.971
- Anything else?
- Her hot bod.

21:24.040 --> 21:28.728
Okay. Okay.
Well, the hot bod is not a characteristic.

21:28.800 --> 21:31.963
- But... Okay?
- How long do we have to do this for?

21:32.040 --> 21:33.804
Well, we're gonna do it until we finish...

21:33.880 --> 21:36.000
and then we're gonna move on
to the fluorescence work.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.684
Got it.

21:39.760 --> 21:41.364
Okay.

21:45.040 --> 21:47.202
Water delivery.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.570
Come in.

21:49.640 --> 21:52.120
- Where do you want this?
- Hi. The kitchen.

21:52.200 --> 21:54.487
Okay. Back to work.

22:11.080 --> 22:13.003
Mischa Barton got a D.U.I.

22:13.080 --> 22:15.686
Really? Wow.

22:17.440 --> 22:20.046
Paris Hilton's hosting
a party in Vegas tonight.

22:20.120 --> 22:23.090
Where does she live?
Can you find her house?

22:23.160 --> 22:24.685
Um...

22:28.280 --> 22:32.171
2342 Briar Summit Circle.

22:35.200 --> 22:36.929
Let's go there.

22:37.040 --> 22:39.168
Do you think we could find a way in?

22:39.240 --> 22:43.325
Uh, looks like you could get in
going up this hill by her house.

22:43.400 --> 22:45.801
I bet she'd leave her
keys under her mat.

22:47.920 --> 22:49.729
Awesome!

22:57.480 --> 23:00.768
- Oh, my fucking gosh!

23:00.840 --> 23:04.640
It's her pet monkey. Hi, little guy.

23:05.880 --> 23:07.644
Okay. Come on.

23:16.480 --> 23:18.482
Holy shit.

23:22.240 --> 23:24.720
- Marc.
- Huh?

23:24.840 --> 23:26.080
That's amazing.

23:30.440 --> 23:33.091
Let's go upstairs. Come on.

23:33.160 --> 23:35.083
- Come on.
- Okay.

23:35.160 --> 23:38.084
- Oh, my God.
- I know, right?

23:39.120 --> 23:42.090
- No way.

23:42.160 --> 23:44.083
Wow.

23:52.920 --> 23:54.445
Wow.

24:01.040 --> 24:03.691
- Becca, I don't-
- Oh, my God.

24:05.960 --> 24:07.041
Wow.

24:08.520 --> 24:11.364
- Come on. Let's get the fuck out of here.
- It's fine.

24:11.440 --> 24:13.522
Let's keep going.

24:13.600 --> 24:15.728
Come on.

24:15.800 --> 24:17.962
- Come on.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.002
Look at her sunglasses.

24:23.080 --> 24:25.447
These are Alexander McQueen.

24:32.080 --> 24:33.605
Come on.

24:42.120 --> 24:43.724
Whoa.

24:43.800 --> 24:45.529
Oh, my God.

24:45.600 --> 24:48.080
I know, right?

24:48.160 --> 24:50.481
She has so much stuff.

24:52.920 --> 24:54.922
It's amazing.

25:01.920 --> 25:05.322
- We gotta go.
- Take a picture first.

25:05.440 --> 25:07.807
- Come on.
- Then we're leaving.

25:07.880 --> 25:10.451
Fine. Ready?

25:11.280 --> 25:13.442
That's cute. Let's go.

25:14.200 --> 25:15.770
All right.

25:18.760 --> 25:21.570
- It's her nightclub room.
- Come on. Let's go.

25:21.640 --> 25:24.007
Don't trip out. it's fine.

25:25.520 --> 25:28.330
Oh, my God! No way.
I totally want to go to Paris's.

25:28.400 --> 25:30.528
Yeah, it was sweet.
We hung out in her nightclub room.

25:30.600 --> 25:32.364
- I got this.

25:32.440 --> 25:34.886
- Oh, my God!
- Isn't that beautiful?

25:34.960 --> 25:38.328
That's so ill! O.G. motherfucker!

25:38.400 --> 25:40.368
- Damn!
- No way. How did you get in?

25:40.440 --> 25:43.444
Dude, her key was under the mat.
We just walked in. It was so fucking chill.

25:43.560 --> 25:45.369
- Under the fucking mat.
- You just walked in?

25:45.480 --> 25:47.050
- Just walked right in.
- Holy shit!

25:47.120 --> 25:48.884
- Just right in.
- To Paris Hilton's house?

25:48.960 --> 25:51.691
Yeah.
And the best part is we can all go back.

25:51.760 --> 25:53.961
We just have to check

You know it doesn't look good on you.

- And we have a “go see” for the BCBG runway show.

46:46.840 --> 46:50.049
Oh, that's huge. Good job.

46:50.160 --> 46:53.164
And that's a cute dress.
Did you get a new dress?

46:53.240 --> 46:56.767
Mm-hmm.
Our friend Marc... he's a stylist.

46:56.840 --> 46:59.047
He let us borrow some stuff
for the auditions.

46:59.120 --> 47:01.009
- That's nice.
- Mmm.

47:01.080 --> 47:04.050
His dad has a production company
that he helps style for.

47:04.120 --> 47:06.646
What's it called?

47:06.760 --> 47:08.922
I don't remember. Like...

47:09.000 --> 47:12.243
- Something... “International.”
- Mmm.

47:12.320 --> 47:15.449
Uh, Mom, we actually have to get going...

47:15.560 --> 47:20.248
because we're meeting this manager tonight
who could be really helpful.

47:20.320 --> 47:24.120
Yeah, he knows a lot of photographers
and producers, so...

47:24.200 --> 47:26.965
- A manager?
- Hmm.

47:28.360 --> 47:30.522
I'd totally do that singer guy.

47:30.600 --> 47:33.524
- But did you see how small his hands are?
- No. Ew.

47:33.600 --> 47:35.602
Yeah, that could be gross.

47:39.120 --> 47:41.851
Dude, we have to get in that video.

47:41.960 --> 47:44.930
- I know.
- Does this look good?

47:45.000 --> 47:47.526
Yeah, I mean, do you feel good in that?

47:47.600 --> 47:49.568
I want to be hot but not desperate.

47:49.640 --> 47:51.165
Totally.

47:52.520 --> 47:54.727
- I think it looks cute.
- Yeah?

47:54.800 --> 47:57.610
- Show me a different top.
- All right.

48:03.400 --> 48:05.562
My butt look good in these jeans?

48:05.640 --> 48:07.881
Your butt looks awesome.

48:09.840 --> 48:11.365
Come on.

48:33.440 --> 48:35.841
So, Marc, what can I do for you?

48:35.920 --> 48:38.002
- Um...

48:38.080 --> 48:40.890
I was wondering if you could, uh...

48:42.600 --> 48:44.807
could sell these for me.

48:48.840 --> 48:51.605
- Where'd you get them?
- Uh, we found them.

48:53.000 --> 48:54.161
I see.

49:00.640 --> 49:03.450
Well, what do you think?
Can you take them?

49:08.680 --> 49:10.887
I don't know.

49:11.680 --> 49:13.728
I could see.

49:16.840 --> 49:20.128
Tell you what.
I'll give you five grand for them.

49:21.160 --> 49:22.889
Aren't they worth a lot more?

49:23.920 --> 49:25.684
Not stolen ones.

49:28.080 --> 49:30.686
Okay. Sweet. Thanks.

49:34.400 --> 49:37.483

How many times
have you guys been up here?

53:06.880 --> 53:09.929
- This is, like, our fifth time.
- And she never noticed?

53:10.080 --> 53:13.721
We never take enough for it to be obvious.
I mean, come on. it's Paris Hilton.

53:13.800 --> 53:15.040
- Yeah.
- Yeah, right.

53:15.120 --> 53:17.120
- She's got so much stuff.
- I know, right?

53:17.160 --> 53:19.640
- It's great.
- It's chill.

53:24.120 --> 53:26.168
I don't know.
You'd never wake up though.

53:26.240 --> 53:29.005
- You'd sleep in all day.
- Here we go.

53:31.040 --> 53:33.850
- Whoa.
- Oh, shit!

53:33.920 --> 53:36.082
- Come on. Let's get the fuck out of here.
- What?

53:36.160 --> 53:37.844
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Hey, Sam.

53:37.920 --> 53:39.490
- What? - Your coat.
- Let's go.

53:39.560 --> 53:41.927
Okay. Let's try it with this.

53:43.440 --> 53:45.442
Now fix your hair.

53:46.800 --> 53:48.802
Oh, yeah.
You could totally pull this off.

53:49.800 --> 53:52.121
You're like an off-duty supermodel.

53:52.200 --> 53:54.487
- Really?
- Yeah.

53:55.960 --> 53:59.248
These Chloé sandals
could work with it too.

53:59.320 --> 54:01.846
- For, like, a day look.
- Yeah, definitely.

54:01.920 --> 54:03.843
- Right?
- Here. Try 'em on.

54:06.760 --> 54:08.649
- Hello?
<i>- Turn on KTLA.</i>

54:08.720 --> 54:10.882
- What?
<i>- Now.</i>

54:11.000 --> 54:13.401
<i>- After a break-in earlier this year...</i>
- Oh, my God.

54:13.520 --> 54:16.000
<i>Audrina Patridge posted
this security footage on her Web site.</i>

54:16.080 --> 54:17.809
Shit.

54:17.880 --> 54:20.451
<i>She's asking anyone who has information
about the break-in...</i>

54:20.520 --> 54:22.170
<i>to contact police at the number below.</i>

54:22.240 --> 54:24.163
<i>It's fine. You can't see who it is.</i>

54:24.280 --> 54:27.090
- Shit. Fuck. One second, Rebecca.
- Just chill out.

54:27.200 --> 54:29.009
I can't talk.

54:34.520 --> 54:37.524
- Everything all right in here?
- Yes, Mr. Hall.

54:37.600 --> 54:39.602
We're sorry for making too much noise.

54:39.680 --> 54:42.047
Everything's fine, Dad.

54:42.120 --> 54:43.610
All right.

54:47.200 --> 54:49.441
You're stressing me out.

55:16.280 --> 55:19.489
Carly keeps texting me. it's so annoying.

55:19.560 --> 55:21.881
Ew. She's so grimy.

55:21.960 --> 55:23.450
I know.

55:27.280 --> 55:29.521
I think I'm gonna go to Sagebrush later.

55:29.600 --> 55:31.568
Cool. Who's playing?

55:31.680 --> 55:34.490
I don't know. A couple local bands.

55:35.480 --> 55:37.767
I want to go to Rachel Bilson's.

55:37.840 --> 55:40.525
She's in Paris for fashion week.

55:40.600 --> 55:42.682
Don't you think you should
chill out a little bit?

55:42.760 --> 55:45.366
Yeah. That news thing
totally freaked me out.

55:45.440 --> 55:49.047
Nothing happened.
There's no way of telling who it is anyway.

55:50.320 --> 55:53.449
Come on.
Can you find her house for me, please?

55:54.600 --> 55:57.365
I want some Chanel.

55:57.440 --> 56:00.842
- I don't know.
- Come on. You're my best friend.

56:00.960 --> 56:03.930
Please? Let's go get some stuff.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.731
We're going to Rachel Bilson's.
Wanna come?

56:06.840 --> 56:10.208
<i>Hells yeah. Text me where.</i>

56:10.280 --> 56:12.886
<i>Is she still dating Hayden Christensen?</i>

56:12.960 --> 56:14.689
I don't know.

56:14.760 --> 56:16.683
Marc thinks so.

57:24.160 --> 57:25.969
Come on.

57:28.360 --> 57:32.445
<i>I think the biggest problem was
after the Audrina thing, nothing happened.</i>

57:32.520 --> 57:37.082
<i>It gave Rebecca that self-boost that, “Oh, this is okay.
I can get away with this.”</i>

57:37.160 --> 57:41.210
<i>And I think her projecting that onto me
made me think that it was gonna be okay.</i>

57:43.480 --> 57:45.209
- Yo, Becca.
- Hey. What's up?

57:45.280 --> 57:46.964
I heard you went to Paris Hilton's.

57:47.040 --> 57:48.883
- Yeah.
- And you took some stuff?

57:48.960 --> 57:52.089
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's so cool. Paris Hilton.

57:52.160 --> 57:54.083
We're gonna go get a drink. Lates.

57:54.160 --> 57:56.606
I can't believe she went to
Paris Hilton's house.

57:59.760 --> 58:02.809
What up?
Where have you guys been tonight?

58:02.880 --> 58:06.168
- We went to Rachel Bilson's.
- No fucking way!

58:06.240 --> 58:09.403
- Yeah. It was chill.
- Sick!

58:11.640 --> 58:13.768
You went to Rachel Bilson's?

58:13.840 --> 58:17.003
- Yeah. She's in Paris at fashion week.
- Shut the fuck up.

58:17.080 --> 58:19.003
We just went in.

58:20.240 --> 58:23.847
Yeah, look at their chill-ass
Chanel purses, dude.

58:26.240 --> 58:28.129
What the fuck are you doing? Come on.

58:28.200 --> 58:30.168
Come on now.
- Puff, puff, pass.

58:30.240 --> 58:31.366
Puff, puff, puff.

59:40.560 --> 59:44.531
<i>Rebecca's, like, biggest
conquest was Lindsay Lohan.</i>

59:44.640 --> 59:46.847
<i>She was her ultimate fashion icon.</i>

59:46.920 --> 59:49.924
<i>Lindsay Lohan
is fighting back against accusations...</i>

59:50.000 --> 59:54.085
<i>she stole a $2,500 necklace
from a Southern California jewelry store.</i>

59:54.160 --> 59:57.164
<i>Her attorney addressed
the matter for the first time.</i>

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:04.000
This is the dress she wore
to the Cosmopolitan opening.

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:06.202
Oh, my God. Let me see it.

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:08.282
I want to try it on. it's amazing.

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:14.450
These are cute. These are really useful.

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:16.204
Yeah.

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:39.929
When are you coming back from Vegas?

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.641
I don't know. Just gonna stay with my dad
until things calm down with my mom.

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:45.364
- I'll call you from there?
- Okay.

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.363
Will you hold on to
some of my stuff for me?

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:48.521
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay. Bye.

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:50.244

from the night of March 23,
when her house was burglarized.

Comparing the clips...

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:36.929
it looks like these are
the same burglars...

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.651
as in the Audrina Patridge
security video...

01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:41.961

the connection...

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:43.883

Ma'am, can you please step out of the way?

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:26.169
- Out of the way.
- For what?

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:27.969
- Is anyone else in the house, ma'am?
- Mom?

01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:29.760

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:51.603
Just sit down.

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:53.091
- Just sit down.
- Why?

We're conducting an investigation.
Before we're done...

- Put your hands behind your back.
- Mom?

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:07.041
- Mom? Mom?
- Excuse me. Sorry.

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:08.610
- Excuse me.
- Get her back.

01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:10.409
- Can you stop...
- I need you to stop right here.

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:12.767
- I need to speak to my mom.
- ...what you're doing with my daughter.

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:15.844
I need to speak to my mom. Mom?

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:19.481
- Call the lawyer. Call a lawyer!
- Mom, why are they taking her?

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:23.969
You're hurting me.
You're really hurting me. Mom.

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:27.161
Can you call the...
Ow!

01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:32.609
Ow. I want to talk to my mom.

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:35.365
Ow. Ow.

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:44.845
- Hello? How can I help you?
- Is this the home of Rebecca Ahn?

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:48.009
I'm her mother, but she's staying
with her father in Nevada.

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:01.491
Easy, Tank.

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:04.481
What the fuck, man?

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:19.649
Chloe.

01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:22.610
- Carrot-beet?
- No.

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:41.691
Crystal, shh! Crystal.

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:46.761
Crystal. Chloe.

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:53.888
Then Rebecca wanted
to go to Orlando Bloom's.

01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:57.123
We knew he was away, from the Internet.
You know, you Google his name...

01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:01.529
and it says Orlando Bloom's shooting a movie
in New York, and he's with Miranda Kerr.

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:05.446
So we just walked in.
The door was unlocked. There was no alarm.

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:07.249
The door was unlocked?

01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:10.523
I'm really sorry about what I did.

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:12.602
Did you know
Rebecca was leaving the state?

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:18.165
I... I just knew that she was going
to stay at her dad's...

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:20.811
because she wasn't getting along
with her mom and her stepdad.

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:24.008
You didn't know she was taking
stolen property...

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:27.163
across state lines
and leaving you holding the bag?

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:32.160
I thought she was just
gonna go see her dad.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.923
Metro Police. Are you Rebecca Ahn?

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.844
- Yes.
- We have a warrant to search the premises. Step aside.

01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:57.649
Move back.

01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:02.248
Bobby. Downstairs.

01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:04.527
Jeff, upstairs. See what you find.

01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:06.244
Here's your warrant.

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:09.005
Do you know why we're in your home,
serving you a search warrant?

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:11.287
- Yes.
- Why do you think we're here?

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:13.727
My friend Marc was arrested.
He called me from jail...

01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:16.246
and said the police had done
a search warrant on his home.

01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:18.805
- Do you know why?
- I've been watching <i>TMZ.</i>

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:22.566
They've been saying I'm a person
of interest in these burglaries.

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:25.211
Were you involved in these burglaries
of these celebrities?

01:08:25.279 --> 01:08:26.930
No, I wasn't.

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:31.523
Is there going to be any property from
those burglaries in this residence?

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:33.443
- No.
- Have you ever been...

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:36.808
- to these celebrity homes that were burglarized?
- No.

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:38.840
Could any
of your fingerprints or D.N.A...

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:40.848
- be found in any of the victims' homes?
- No.

01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:46.889
You boys having fun?
Find something interesting? What?

01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:49.691
- Yeah, we got a few things on the list.
- Right on.

01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:51.808
Anything else?

01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:55.965
- Yeah, we also came up with these.
- Nice.

01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:58.725
We found a jacket and jeans
that match a description by Lohan...

01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:01.406
and some personal photographs
of Paris Hilton.

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:08.287
If I tell you where everything is,
would you let me go?

01:09:08.359 --> 01:09:11.011
Hypothetically, let's say I can
help you locate this property...

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:13.651
and tell you who has it,
how would that help me?

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:17.850
<i>Rebecca Ahn, thought
to be the ringleader, was arrested...</i>

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:20.526
<i>and awaits her hearing
with the other members.</i>

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:23.921
Stay tuned for the latest
on the Bling Ring.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.321
Did you speak to any of the victims?

01:09:26.399 --> 01:09:28.323
I've spoken to all the victims.

01:09:28.399 --> 01:09:31.085
Really? What did Lindsay say?

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:09.202
- Nicki. Nicki.
- Nicki. Nicki.

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:11.726
- How was it in there?
- It was not good.

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:14.489
Okay, thank you.

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:20.165
Nicki. Kate from Vanity Fair is here.

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:24.324
Can I get you something to drink?

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:26.801
So how is Sam related?

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:30.248
- We have adopted her.
- I was friends with her mother.

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:33.085
- Mom, this is my interview.
- Okay.

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:38.726
Yeah. So, she has been living with us.

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:41.451
Um, we met when my parents divorced...

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:44.000
and now my mom homeschools all of us.

01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:47.402
Based on the philosophy of <i>The Secret...</i>

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:50.450
which is based on the laws of attraction.

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:53.251
- Can I talk, please?
- Sure.

01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:55.891
I'm sorry.

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:59.009
The reason that we related so well...

01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:03.244
is that my dad
is a recovering alcoholic...

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:05.488
- and Sam's mom...
- She's a practicing...

01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:09.770
is a practicing drug addict and alcoholic.

01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:12.446
And our moms became, like, best friends.

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:16.286
- We were, and she went off the deep end.
- Please!

01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:19.170
- So, basically you took her in.
- Yes.

01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:21.891
We took her in about six years ago.

01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:25.203
But let's, uh...
Let's... Let's get back to Nicki, okay?

01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:31.130
Uh, so Adam here told me
that you do charity work.

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:34.010
Yes. We do a lot of stuff
through our church.

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:36.845
- Mm-hmm.
- It's called the Agape Church.

01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:40.129
- Right.
- It's the religious science philosophy...

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:42.202
beneath <i>The Secret.</i>

01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:49.410
Um, my other sister, Gabby,
is on a trip with them building homes.

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:52.643
And they do a yearly trip to Africa...

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:55.883
where they build wells
and schools for kids.

01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:58.088
Which country?

01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:00.561
Um, I can't remember
exactly which country...

01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:06.807
but we do bake sales and, like, feeding
the homeless and that kind of stuff.

01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:09.201
Okay. So there's a little bit
of a disconnect...

01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:11.931
between your positive pursuits
and what's happening now.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.002
Nicki, I don't want you
to answer that comment.

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:17.561
Well, I think that I am.

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:19.563
Don't.

01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:22.166
I have, like,
a good statement to say about this.

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:24.004
She could speak generally.

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:27.846
I think this situation
was attracted into my life...

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:31.208
as a huge learning lesson for me...

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:36.127
to grow and expand
as a spiritual human being.

01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:39.409
I believe that I am an old soul.

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:41.209
You are, honey. She is.

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:43.203
We've gotten to know
Nicki and her family...

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:46.921
and we believe that she is an extremely
focused and honest young woman...

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.128
who has a lot to offer the community.

01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:52.204
And we agree that there
has not been a disconnect.

01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:54.248
That there were circumstances
that happened...

01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:57.642
but Nicki herself
has continued to stay on her plane...

01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:01.770
despite the tumultuous
experiences happening.

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:07.400
What's your goal, or life plan,
if you have one?

01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:10.484
I do. I think it's my journey...

01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:14.042
to push for peace
and the health of the planet.

01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:17.801
Nicki's expressed to me
a lot of her humanitarianism.

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:20.281
It's my main goal.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.561
I... want to be a leader...

01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:29.850
and do things that people really notice.

01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:33.081
That's why I'm taking business-

01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:36.403
so that I can be a leader...

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:40.280
and-and take a stand for people.

01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:45.765
But I went to Indian Hills
to learn and be with my peers...

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:50.402
but I was always self-conscious that I wasn't,
you know, as good-looking as other people.

01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:52.164
And now you're a star.

01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:55.284
Yeah... On my Facebook page recently...

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:58.011
I had over 800 friend requests.

01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:00.441
I accepted them all.
I mean, I didn't even look at them.

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:03.533
- And then I noticed someone
had created a fan page for me.

01:14:03.559 --> 01:14:04.311
- Hmm.

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:08.649
It's just kind of awkward
that so many people are loving me...

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:10.840
for... for something
that's so looked down on in society.

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:14.362
If it had been, you know, something
that were to benefit the community...

01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:17.125
or something like that, I'd love it.

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:19.806
But it's kind of showing America has this.

01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:23.805
This sick fascination
with a Bonnie and Clyde kind of thing.

01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:59.566
Does this look good?

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:02.081
Is this conservative?

01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:04.561
If you like a secretary-style hooker.

01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:07.086
Bite me.

01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:09.802
Maybe with a jacket?

01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:20.727
Well, it looks better.

01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:21.961
Right?

01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:24.361
Ah, you need lower heels.

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:27.241
Yeah.

01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:29.448
Where are my kitten heels?

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:41.327
You're so lucky
you weren't on that video.

01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:43.767
I know. Sucks.

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:46.650
Yeah. It does.

01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:53.201
Maybe I need to wear something longer.

01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:57.001
Do you own anything longer?

01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:59.811
- No.

01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:01.405
Mom does.

01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:05.963
- Can I have a five-milligram Adderall?
- Mm-hmm.

01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:08.890
Okay, just remember
what we went over with Shannon.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.924
They can't prove that you were
in any of those houses, okay?

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.082
- I know, Mom.
- All right?

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:17.369
Do you want to just ground ourselves
really quick? Nicki?

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:23.004
I know there is one mind,
one presence and one power.

01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:25.242
- Mom, shouldn't we go?
- Emily.

01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:27.322
- What? - Stop talking.
- She's praying.

01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:31.764
I know I'm always protected,
and karma cleanses my journey.

01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:34.684
Thank you, Lord, so much for this truth.

01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:36.683
- And so it is.
- And so it is.

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:40.128
So it is. And you rock, girl. Okay?

01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:42.846
- Right here. Right here. Nicki. Nicki.

01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:46.003
- Okay, Nicki.
- Hey, Nicki, Nicki. Can we get a comment? Nicki.

01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:47.770
Nicki.

01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:49.205
- Nicki.
- Nicki.

01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:50.691
Nicki.

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:56.962
This has been a very difficult time
for myself and my family.

01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:59.407
Thank you for respecting my privacy.

01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:01.562
I look forward to my day in court.

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:05.041
Chloe!

01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:11.087
- Marc.
- Marc.

01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:12.286
Right here. Right here.

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:14.931
Hey, Marc.
How does it feel to be a rat?

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.001
Okay.

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:42.000
Remain seated. Come to order.

01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:46.961
Division 31 is now in session. The
Honorable Judge Patricia Henley presiding.

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:53.085
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:54.685
Are all parties ready?

01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:25.842
<i>Rebecca Ahn, you are found guilty...</i>

01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:29.049
<i>on four counts of first-degree
residential burglary.</i>

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:33.045
<i>You are sentenced to four years in state
prison and $800,000 in restitution.</i>

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:37.523

<i>You are sentenced to one year in county

01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:03.968
<i>Members of
the Bling Ring were sentenced today...</i>

01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:06.202
<i>for their role in a rash of break-ins...</i>

01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:10.171
<i>that netted more than
three million in high-end goods.</i>

01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:48.002
We're here with Nicki Moore, who just served 30
days for her involvement in the Bling Ring...

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:51.926
and shared a cellblock
with one of its victims, Lindsay Lohan.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.731
There were reports
that Lindsay was crying.

01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:59.044
With you being next to her,
did you actually hear any of this?

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:02.203
Yeah. I could hear her crying
the first day...

01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:06.205
which is really hard
when you're just trying to be strong.

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:10.126
But I just really kept to myself...

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:13.249
and just tried to get through the day.

01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:16.881
It's hard when you're
woken up at, like, 5:30.

01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:18.803
And how'd she look?

01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:21.201
She got to keep her extensions in.

01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:25.490
A lot of the girls were talking-“Oh,
I had to take my weave out,” or whatever.

01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:29.121
But, um, she was in orange like all of us.

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:31.567
Now, were you nervous being next to her?

01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:35.406
Because you actually were accused
of being a part of the group...

01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:37.403
that allegedly robbed her house.

01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:42.407
Yeah. I mean, it was scary for me.

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:46.451
They were showing the surveillance video.

01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:50.161
They were showing the story
on TVs inside...

01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:53.403
and, you know, little do people know...

01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:56.768
that when that first video came out...

01:21:56.840 --> 01:22:00.242
I was actually in contact
with her manager...

01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:04.291
to tell her who I believed
the people were who robbed her house.

01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:07.967
I mean, when I get to tell
my side of this story...

01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:09.929
people are gonna know the truth.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.128
So, that's nerve-racking.

01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:14.646
She could think you robbed her house.

01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:18.122
Yeah. She could have.

01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:21.682
But, you know, anyway...

01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:25.526
you can follow everything about me
and my journey...
