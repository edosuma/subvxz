00:25.692 --> 00:27.736
It’s never a surprise when a great idea

00:27.819 --> 00:30.322
to make money doing something bad

00:30.405 --> 00:32.698
goes from good to fucked-up.

00:33.492 --> 00:35.494
One minute you’re robbing everybody.

00:35.577 --> 00:38.956
Making money, paying bills,
fancy cars, women.

00:39.748 --> 00:41.458
-Then boom!

00:41.542 --> 00:42.501
Just like that.

00:42.584 --> 00:43.919
Everything blows up.

00:44.503 --> 00:46.213
And you’re running for your life.

00:46.296 --> 00:48.799
-Yo!
-Or at least your freedom.

00:50.425 --> 00:51.468
What the fuck happened?

00:52.135 --> 00:54.555
-Boy had a gun.
-A gun?

00:55.305 --> 00:56.139
Where he get a gun?

00:57.933 --> 00:59.560
Yo, Cloud, you never search him?

01:00.143 --> 01:01.270
Yeah, I searched that motherfucker!

01:01.353 --> 01:02.771
So how the fuck him get the gun then?

01:02.855 --> 01:06.191
-The fuck should I know?
-Cha bomboclaat, man!

01:06.275 --> 01:07.734
Yo, let's leave. Yo, let's leave.

01:07.818 --> 01:10.404
-What about him?
-You a fuck up,

01:10.487 --> 01:11.822
so you fucking finish him off!

01:11.905 --> 01:14.533
-What do you mean, finish him?
-Let me show you!

01:14.616 --> 01:16.618
-Holy fuck!

01:17.536 --> 01:18.787
You want to join him?

01:20.622 --> 01:24.084
You can leave with us,
or you can die with him.

01:28.547 --> 01:29.715
Your turn!

01:30.465 --> 01:33.343
-Finish him!
-He's already fucking dead.

01:33.427 --> 01:36.346
No, he's not dead until you shoot him.

01:38.974 --> 01:40.017
Finish him.

01:40.642 --> 01:43.645
Yo. Shoot him, Cloud.

01:47.274 --> 01:48.734
My name is Nigel Malone.

01:50.027 --> 01:52.946
But everyone calls me "Cat."

01:54.615 --> 01:58.410
I came to the US to escape
the madness of my home country.

01:58.493 --> 02:00.954
Well, at least that was the plan.

02:02.331 --> 02:04.583
But like they say about plans,

02:04.666 --> 02:07.085
it’s only good until it goes wrong.

02:07.169 --> 02:08.002
Where the money?

02:08.961 --> 02:09.838
There's no money.

02:10.756 --> 02:11.882
What you mean? Where it at?

02:11.965 --> 02:13.592
Cloud fucked up.

02:15.052 --> 02:17.721
He left the boy strapped.
He never search the boy.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.014
You blaming me for this shit?

02:19.097 --> 02:20.516
Pussy, what you say?

02:23.185 --> 02:25.687
Anyway, Bandit had to shoot him.

02:25.771 --> 02:27.648
After that, we clean up and clear out.

02:27.731 --> 02:29.441
We never have time
to search for the bread.

02:30.567 --> 02:34.196
That's the second body
this month! Bloodclaat!

02:37.491 --> 02:39.243
We have to shut down
and relax until things cool off.

02:39.326 --> 02:40.827
Where I come from,

02:40.911 --> 02:43.664
opportunity comes in the form of a talent,

02:43.747 --> 02:46.124
or making life and death choices.

02:47.042 --> 02:48.710
Now, unless you’re crazy,

02:48.794 --> 02:50.295
who wakes up and says,

02:50.379 --> 02:52.881
"I want my life to revolve around prison

02:52.965 --> 02:55.717
-and death choices"?
-Rassclaat, my phone, I left me phone.

02:55.801 --> 02:56.844
No one.

02:57.719 --> 02:59.096
It’s all about environment

02:59.179 --> 03:01.431
and the opportunities it presents.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.388
♪ Murder ♪

03:45.809 --> 03:47.728
God, I'm going to miss him.

03:48.437 --> 03:51.106
Carol, baby, stop the crying.

03:51.732 --> 03:54.651
Going to have to be a big girl
for Mommy now, you know.

03:56.695 --> 03:59.615
Cat, you no see
your mommy, big man, right?

03:59.698 --> 04:02.784
You have to be a big boy and take care
of your sister for me, you hear?

04:02.868 --> 04:05.996
-But, Mommy, you know she don't listen.
-Shut up.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.916
Behave yourself, and you're going
to listen to your brother, you hear me?

04:09.958 --> 04:12.961
The two of you look at me
right now. Look at me.

04:14.588 --> 04:17.423
I'm your mother
making a promise right now.

04:17.507 --> 04:21.553
I'm going to America, but I will
send for you soon, I'm not leaving.

04:21.637 --> 04:24.181
At this point, it's all white noise.

04:25.140 --> 04:28.268
Standing here listening
to my mother saying goodbye.

04:28.352 --> 04:32.689
And than watching her walk out the door
to get on a plane heading to New York.

04:33.524 --> 04:36.068
All in the name of the American Dream.

04:36.818 --> 04:39.738
That’s what's
being sold everyday.

04:39.821 --> 04:42.407
The chance to get rich, live better.

04:43.242 --> 04:45.744
And coming from
a third world country, shit.

04:46.453 --> 04:50.165
People are willing to do whatever
it takes, even if it means...

04:51.291 --> 04:53.293
...leaving their children behind.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.113
Where you go, little boy?

05:21.196 --> 05:23.115
Don't you see it's all grown man there?

05:23.198 --> 05:25.701
What? Girl, move out of the way.

05:26.243 --> 05:28.579
Wait, you turn big man?

05:30.747 --> 05:31.874
What is this?

05:32.958 --> 05:36.003
Me not a big man. Me a big boy, now move.

05:42.050 --> 05:43.677
I'm going to tell your aunty on you.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.722
You can go right now.

05:46.805 --> 05:48.473
I don’t know about anywhere else.

05:48.557 --> 05:53.812
But in Jamaica,
it’s God then comes the Don.

05:53.896 --> 05:55.564
Everything go through him.

05:56.148 --> 05:59.318
Even politicians to get local votes.

06:00.319 --> 06:03.739
You want opportunity,
you get in good with the Don.

06:03.822 --> 06:07.075
You want to be dead,
you get in bad with the Don.

06:07.159 --> 06:09.036
What the bloodclaat, doing on the road?

06:10.078 --> 06:11.163
What is going on?

06:11.246 --> 06:12.122
Not a shit.

06:13.707 --> 06:14.708
Hold on.

06:14.791 --> 06:17.127
You cursing and your mother beat you

06:17.211 --> 06:18.754
and almost killed you
the other day, for cursing?

06:18.837 --> 06:21.006
And you come curse in front of a big man.

06:24.176 --> 06:25.719
You know that she gone out now.

06:27.513 --> 06:29.556
Since your mother gone,
you run the streets now?

06:31.183 --> 06:34.186
Next thing I know you're on the streets,
with the little hot heads.

06:35.270 --> 06:36.855
Make sure you go to school.

06:37.814 --> 06:39.149
Go on with you, get out of here.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.693
True, man.
Go to your yard, man, little boy.

06:41.777 --> 06:44.947
-Why you always playing with me?
-Little boy, go home.

06:45.030 --> 06:48.283
-Little boy, go home.
-You always playing with me.

06:48.367 --> 06:51.620
Come off the ends.
What happen to you, little boy?

06:51.703 --> 06:56.041
Cool, these things you make happen,
General? He needs to go to bed, man.

07:04.341 --> 07:07.219
Yo, let him go. Bloodclaat, let him go.

07:12.182 --> 07:13.767
Bumboclaat, little boy,
I'm going to kill you.

07:24.027 --> 07:25.529
You see nothing?

07:25.612 --> 07:27.155
You see nothing?

07:28.866 --> 07:30.033
You see nothing?

07:30.742 --> 07:32.369
Take out that piece of shit now,
and dump him.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.662
He's still moving?

07:37.457 --> 07:39.001
Oh, in case I didn’t mention it,

07:39.084 --> 07:42.296
being a don means
that you have to be violent.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.464
Very violent.

07:46.258 --> 07:48.927
Boy, General, we have few
issue to address, you know?

07:49.011 --> 07:51.054
Issue, where the bloodclaat
you get issue from?

07:51.722 --> 07:55.893
Ms. Barry told me
they rob her house, boss.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.603
They rob her house?

07:57.686 --> 08:00.606
Yo, those pussy from Klasco
who rob her house, you know.

08:00.689 --> 08:03.192
Tell her I say, she'll
get back every bloodclaat thing.

08:03.275 --> 08:04.943
I promise she get back everything, man.

08:05.027 --> 08:06.737
And we have a next issue again, you know.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.698
The little batty boy police Mr. Campbell.

08:09.781 --> 08:13.493
Everyday he is asking for more money.

08:15.704 --> 08:17.748
That pussyhole man.

08:17.831 --> 08:21.001
Police boy never kill no man,
but want more money.

08:21.084 --> 08:23.795
We got to start being supreme.
Real supreme.

08:24.421 --> 08:28.842
It's your friend, you should deal with him
because trust me I don't like him.

08:28.926 --> 08:30.677
Tell you the truth,
I don't like that police boy.

08:30.761 --> 08:33.096
What's going with Bragga?

08:33.179 --> 08:35.849
Bragga. Bragga stray too much, man.

08:36.642 --> 08:39.352
Tell Bragga he jux,
so he must respect the jux.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.730
-So what happen to me?
-You have issue too?

08:42.773 --> 08:44.441
Like you didn't learn your lesson yet.

08:44.525 --> 08:46.902
Yeah, man, but we need to make some money.

08:47.819 --> 08:48.987
You need to make some money?

08:49.071 --> 08:50.572
See the Order.

08:50.656 --> 08:52.950
The Order is not just
about making money, you know.

08:53.659 --> 08:56.703
The Order is Brotherhood, Love & Respect.

08:56.787 --> 08:58.205
Loyalty, until you're dead loyal.

08:58.288 --> 09:01.291
-My father told me that already.
-So what?

09:01.792 --> 09:04.086
-You think you ready?
-Yeah, I'm ready.

09:04.169 --> 09:05.754
You ever kill a man yet?

09:06.338 --> 09:08.257
Kill a man? No.

09:08.340 --> 09:09.633
So how you feel like you ready?

09:10.217 --> 09:12.553
I don't know, you know. I just want a job.

09:14.096 --> 09:16.306
Just a job. Job comes with order.

09:16.390 --> 09:18.600
-Kill or be killed.
-Why?

09:18.684 --> 09:20.519
What do you mean why?
What are you talking about why?

09:21.353 --> 09:22.896
You have to kill to get in.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.108
And you have to die to get out.

09:27.526 --> 09:29.027
Remember I told you that.

09:29.736 --> 09:30.863
Remember that.

09:38.579 --> 09:40.747
You know Mr. Joiner at the gas station?

09:40.831 --> 09:42.624
Who you talking about? The miserable one?

09:43.375 --> 09:45.502
Two of them in there.
I want you to get it straight.

09:45.586 --> 09:47.671
A fat one and miserable one.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.173
The miserable one.

09:50.507 --> 09:51.717
I want you to kill him.

09:54.678 --> 09:55.762
Kill him for what?

09:55.846 --> 09:57.431
For your father.

09:58.682 --> 09:59.975
For my father?

10:00.058 --> 10:01.393
What he did to my father?

10:01.935 --> 10:04.438
That pussy informed on your father,
which is why police killed your father.

10:04.521 --> 10:06.273
You going on like you never knew.

10:06.356 --> 10:07.524
So go kill him.

10:12.821 --> 10:13.655
Kill him.

10:16.116 --> 10:16.992
Dead.

10:17.910 --> 10:19.369
Remember that. Dead!

10:21.997 --> 10:23.707
Make sure
you shoot him in the head.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.709
Now, you have to admit that

10:25.792 --> 10:28.462
the world is a better place
without some people.

10:28.545 --> 10:32.633
And this asshole Mr. Joiner here
is one of them.

10:32.716 --> 10:35.511
What the bloodclaat you
looking for? You have money?

10:36.428 --> 10:39.139
Hurry up, man, 'cause I don't have
all day to look at your face.

10:42.226 --> 10:43.519
Give me one sweetie.

10:44.686 --> 10:46.355
I’m playing cool,

10:46.438 --> 10:50.609
but this fucking idiot boy
is why my father is dead.

10:59.576 --> 11:00.619
Pussy.

11:05.582 --> 11:06.542
Oye!

11:08.919 --> 11:09.962
Come here.

11:13.715 --> 11:15.884
-Did you eat?
-Yes.

11:15.968 --> 11:16.885
Eat what?

11:16.969 --> 11:18.053
One sweetie.

11:19.471 --> 11:20.556
One sweetie?

11:21.598 --> 11:22.808
-Yes
-That's food?

11:24.977 --> 11:25.936
Go and go bathe.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.981
Your dinner's soon ready. One sweetie...

11:29.982 --> 11:31.608
What you cooking, aunty?

11:31.692 --> 11:33.485
Leave your sister. Think I didn't see you?

11:34.528 --> 11:35.904
I said to go bathe!

11:36.738 --> 11:37.739
Yes, aunty.

11:42.286 --> 11:43.912
So I figure to do what I have to do.

11:43.996 --> 11:45.622
-I should go to the yard

11:45.706 --> 11:47.374
and hang out
where the neighborhood gangsters

11:47.457 --> 11:49.042
and killers hang out.

11:50.294 --> 11:52.337
Maybe they’ll rub off on me.

11:52.421 --> 11:55.299
Give me the courage
to revenge my father’s death.

11:57.968 --> 12:01.263
These guys here are the ones you’ll see
if you get out of line with the Don.

12:01.930 --> 12:05.601
That is, if he don’t
come kill you himself.

12:06.810 --> 12:08.937
And once I get rid of Mr. Joiner,

12:09.563 --> 12:11.231
I’ll become one of them.

12:12.482 --> 12:14.693
With that comes power.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.069
Not much,

12:16.862 --> 12:18.989
but some money doing
little jobs here and there.

12:30.209 --> 12:33.253
What happen to your baby girl?

12:33.337 --> 12:36.507
I'm the link, man.
Nothing don't change at all.

12:36.590 --> 12:37.925
-What going on, Fire?
-Nothing change.

12:38.509 --> 12:40.302
-What going on?
-What going on, juvie, everything good?

12:40.385 --> 12:41.929
Yeah, everything good, man.

12:42.012 --> 12:43.180
Good, man.

12:44.848 --> 12:46.141
Let me ask you a question.

12:47.351 --> 12:48.477
Why is the man still breathing?

12:49.937 --> 12:51.980
I'm just going to feel him out. Get me.

12:52.898 --> 12:54.441
Feel him out. You love, man?

12:56.151 --> 12:58.070
Murder, you have to murder him, you know.

12:58.153 --> 13:00.364
Yeah, man, I'm going murder him,

13:00.447 --> 13:02.199
but you have to murder him
when he drop him guard.

13:04.034 --> 13:04.868
Cat.

13:05.994 --> 13:08.872
You see, this gangster life you choose,
it's not an easy thing.

13:09.831 --> 13:10.958
You could be dead.

13:12.584 --> 13:14.962
-Trust me, you'd be dead.
-Real talk, man.

13:15.629 --> 13:17.214
It's either your life.

13:18.215 --> 13:19.883
-Or his life.
-His life.

13:25.222 --> 13:26.723
Know what's happening.

13:27.933 --> 13:29.059
You want a drag?

13:29.852 --> 13:32.062
-Yeah, man…
-Go where you got to go, watch him.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.480
Like him a big man ready for thing.

13:33.564 --> 13:35.482
Go on like killer, watch it, you know.

13:35.566 --> 13:38.110
He not ready yet, you know.
He feel like him ready.

13:41.363 --> 13:43.782
There I was looking for a job.

13:43.866 --> 13:47.327
And ended up with one to kill
in the name of revenge.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.788
Serious shit for a kid.

13:50.789 --> 13:54.042
My father used to say
that when you kill a man,

13:54.126 --> 13:57.129
his ghost is a slave to you until you die.

13:57.963 --> 14:01.133
So my father's ghost
must be a slave to Mr. Joiner.

14:01.758 --> 14:05.470
It’s like the ghost is a slave
to his killer, begging to be set free.

14:06.430 --> 14:08.140
But I can set him free.

14:09.558 --> 14:12.853
All I have to do is walk in that store,

14:12.936 --> 14:15.856
pull out the gun and pull the trigger.

14:17.441 --> 14:20.152
But what if Mr. Joiner’s ghost haunts me?

14:21.778 --> 14:23.322
Now that’s scary.

14:36.293 --> 14:39.004
-I don't want no sweetie today.
-What you want?

14:41.006 --> 14:42.299
I want that biscuit there.

14:48.847 --> 14:50.224
Rass!

14:52.351 --> 14:53.769
Easy now, youth.

14:54.728 --> 14:55.896
It's alright, man.

14:56.897 --> 14:58.649
Just, just take anything you want.

14:59.441 --> 15:00.943
-You inform on my father.
-No.

15:01.026 --> 15:03.779
-You kill him.
-No, the police.

15:04.988 --> 15:06.240
You kill him!

16:14.391 --> 16:15.392
Mad.

16:16.059 --> 16:17.895
Come, little Jux, my youth.

16:17.978 --> 16:19.605
Come here, man. Come here, man.

16:20.147 --> 16:22.733
Listen. Good job that you did.

16:25.903 --> 16:27.946
You hold this, man. Keep this, man.

16:28.030 --> 16:29.114
You get me.

16:31.200 --> 16:32.284
Hold that drink.

16:42.044 --> 16:43.879
I'm going give you
something to dance with.

16:45.214 --> 16:46.798
Who that, Pinky?

16:46.882 --> 16:48.509
Pinky, take care of him.

16:50.302 --> 16:51.553
Make a move.

16:59.895 --> 17:01.355
Bloodclaat.

17:01.855 --> 17:04.023
Man is hard, you know, General.

17:04.107 --> 17:06.859
-I know, man.
-Big man thing, this Cat.

17:06.944 --> 17:09.404
Hot head, you know.
But he have the road hot, B.

17:10.071 --> 17:12.574
So send him to the country.

17:12.657 --> 17:14.201
You and I want to take care of that.

17:14.785 --> 17:17.496
From morning I watch
nothing that is soft, man.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.623
What happen to Angela?

17:19.705 --> 17:21.165
-She there, B.
-She there.

17:21.250 --> 17:22.751
-Yeah.
-Here's what you do.

17:23.377 --> 17:25.127
I want you to give her some money.

17:25.712 --> 17:28.757
General, you acting like that's a problem.
You the boss, what you doing, man?

17:53.699 --> 17:56.910
After the shooting,
things got hot for me.

17:56.994 --> 18:00.372
So I was sent away to the country
to stay with a family until it cool down.

18:01.164 --> 18:03.083
Or until they kill the witness.

18:03.667 --> 18:06.128
My aunt didn’t even know where I was.

18:07.004 --> 18:08.213
What's going on?

18:12.342 --> 18:15.345
Everything good. Hmm...

18:17.598 --> 18:19.683
My youth, this is your home for a minute.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.186
-Until things cool off.
-So how long is that?

18:22.769 --> 18:25.147
Don't worry yourself.
Everything good, man.

18:25.230 --> 18:27.107
Go on. They will take care of you.

18:29.568 --> 18:30.903
Come on, just go on.

18:34.531 --> 18:35.407
Go on, man.

18:41.163 --> 18:41.997
Go on, man.

19:29.378 --> 19:30.712
What's going on, Angela?

19:31.630 --> 19:32.548
Where is Cat?

19:32.631 --> 19:35.300
Don't worry yourself, Cat is good.
Just don't call no police.

19:35.884 --> 19:38.595
-That doesn't tell me where he is.
-I said, Cat good.

19:38.679 --> 19:40.472
Just don't call no police!

19:41.098 --> 19:44.226
And the General boss sent
something for you, you know.

19:45.519 --> 19:47.396
Whole lot of money.

19:47.479 --> 19:49.022
Enough shoes.

19:49.106 --> 19:50.399
Enough new shirts.

19:50.983 --> 19:52.025
I don't want it.

19:54.945 --> 19:56.947
What you talking about?
The boss sent money for you.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.532
You talking about you don't want it?

19:59.366 --> 20:00.367
You mad?

20:01.827 --> 20:05.289
Smile. Don't be late for work,
you know. Hard worker.

20:05.831 --> 20:08.375
Big up yourself. Talis, ready.

20:18.802 --> 20:21.930
I’ve watched music videos
and heard a lot about America.

20:22.014 --> 20:25.350
How beautiful it is,
how you can get rich overnight.

20:25.434 --> 20:29.855
Become anything you want to be.
The land of opportunity.

20:31.106 --> 20:33.817
They say you have to watch where you go
because the streets are dangerous.

20:33.901 --> 20:36.904
The cops will kill you
for no reason if you’re Black.

20:36.987 --> 20:38.780
And everyone is racist.

20:38.864 --> 20:42.117
But above all, you can get rich.

20:42.618 --> 20:44.578
Now who don’t want to get rich, huh?

20:45.913 --> 20:48.582
Welcome to America is what
the White man said to me

20:48.665 --> 20:50.542
after he stamped my passport.

20:51.710 --> 20:53.295
Thank you very much.

20:56.048 --> 20:58.592
Almighty God,
we thank you for this blessed day,

20:58.675 --> 21:00.552
for bringing this family together.

21:00.636 --> 21:03.055
We thank you for bringing my children

21:03.138 --> 21:07.100
all the way from Jamaica to the land
of opportunity here in America.

21:07.184 --> 21:10.854
Almighty God, we thank you for health
and strength and for good living.

21:10.938 --> 21:14.608
In your precious son
Jesus' name, we say Amen.

21:14.691 --> 21:15.567
-Amen.
-Amen.

21:18.987 --> 21:21.615
The worst thing about
coming to America as a young adult

21:21.698 --> 21:23.075
is going to school.

21:23.700 --> 21:26.912
They’ll put you back grades,
have you feeling fucking dumb.

21:26.995 --> 21:29.706
Then comes the foreigner
and coconut jokes.

21:31.333 --> 21:33.085
Chapter six to include Ms. Haze

21:33.168 --> 21:35.921
on what we have already
encompassed ourselves,

21:36.004 --> 21:38.924
is you don't have to be a
first generation immigrant to...

21:39.591 --> 21:42.094
Excuse us, we have visitor,
hello, Ms. Hall.

21:42.177 --> 21:45.138
Hello, hello, class, working hard I see.

21:45.222 --> 21:48.308
Ms. Wilson,
I want you to meet Nigel Malone.

21:48.392 --> 21:50.018
He's a transfer student from Jamaica.

21:50.102 --> 21:51.436
Hello, Nigel.

21:52.187 --> 21:54.106
It's a pleasure to have you in my class.

21:55.232 --> 21:57.442
You can take that seat right there.

21:57.526 --> 21:58.777
And here, let me give you this.

21:58.861 --> 22:01.196
We are talking about the American Dream,

22:01.280 --> 22:03.323
and how the individual defines it.

22:03.407 --> 22:04.867
Nigel, why don't you have a seat?

22:09.454 --> 22:10.831
So...

22:10.914 --> 22:13.750
That's what chapter six
was about, but moving on.

22:14.751 --> 22:16.170
Today, being born in this country,

22:16.253 --> 22:18.255
you can do anything
you've set your mind to.

22:18.338 --> 22:20.632
It is the American dream,
it's what we are known

22:20.716 --> 22:22.342
around the world to have, right?

22:22.926 --> 22:24.636
The fact is, we live in America,

22:24.720 --> 22:26.680
you're born here, you have the freedom.

22:26.763 --> 22:29.016
-I'm Karen.
-Cat.

22:29.850 --> 22:32.519
Cat? I thought it was Nigel.

22:32.603 --> 22:35.898
Yeah, but I rather Cat.

22:36.565 --> 22:39.401
-Okay, so...
-Hmm. Okay, Cat.

22:39.484 --> 22:42.654
-Ah, excuse me.
-It's nice to meet you.

22:42.738 --> 22:45.032
-Likewise.
-Karen?

22:45.115 --> 22:46.658
Would you mind speaking a little louder?

22:46.742 --> 22:48.452
I'm sure the rest
of the class is interested

22:48.535 --> 22:49.703
in what you have to say.

22:49.786 --> 22:53.373
I-- I wasn't saying anything.

22:53.457 --> 22:56.001
Shawn, what is your view
of the American Dream?

22:57.336 --> 23:00.047
I think the American Dream
should be for Americans.

23:00.797 --> 23:02.424
And there you have it.

23:02.508 --> 23:05.886
"Welcome to America, motherfucker."

23:08.764 --> 23:10.849
-Hey, girl.
-Hey.

23:17.898 --> 23:20.692
-Need help with that?
-Yeah.

23:20.776 --> 23:22.027
Well, what's the combination?

23:23.362 --> 23:25.489
Don't worry, I'm not going to rob you.

23:32.955 --> 23:34.957
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

23:35.624 --> 23:38.544
-My locker is right here.
-I see you like fucking with coconuts.

23:38.627 --> 23:40.796
-You're such an asshole.
-Yeah, is that what you think of me?

23:40.879 --> 23:42.422
-Yo, why don't you back up a little bit?
-Alright.

23:42.506 --> 23:44.091
Stop it, Shawn, come on now.

23:44.174 --> 23:46.218
What, you think you're tough,
because you from Jamaica?

23:47.344 --> 23:48.387
Yo, boy.

23:49.471 --> 23:50.764
Fuck with me and I will gut you.

23:54.184 --> 23:56.144
-Shit.
-My goodness.

23:57.187 --> 23:59.731
Alright, I'm going
to see you again, pussy.

23:59.815 --> 24:02.192
-I will wait for you.
-What the fuck you looking at, huh?

24:02.276 --> 24:03.861
Yo, what's your problem?

24:03.944 --> 24:05.404
Why don't you get off his dick?

24:06.864 --> 24:07.865
Pussy.

24:15.789 --> 24:17.457
Yo, what's going on?

24:18.333 --> 24:21.295
I hear that your yardie say
that you came from Jamaica. That true?

24:22.129 --> 24:24.590
-Yeah.
-Nice.

24:29.219 --> 24:32.139
Yo. I am the one they call Bandit.

24:32.681 --> 24:35.684
-This is Ozzie, that's Prince.
-Big up.

24:36.602 --> 24:37.603
Cat.

24:38.687 --> 24:40.898
-Which part of Jamaica you come from?
-Kingston.

24:40.981 --> 24:43.233
-Yeah? Which part of Kingston?
-Mm-hmm.

24:43.317 --> 24:46.486
-Kingston 12.
-Bumbaclaat...

24:46.570 --> 24:48.488
That's where my family come from, dog.

24:48.572 --> 24:50.866
-Supposed to know my uncle then?
-What's his name?

24:51.408 --> 24:52.326
General.

24:52.409 --> 24:54.077
Yeah, man.

24:54.161 --> 24:56.538
I know that man real good, yo.

24:56.622 --> 25:00.000
Yeah, man, that's the boss.
You know that family thing I deal with?

25:00.083 --> 25:01.335
So what's going on?

25:10.552 --> 25:12.930
-So how was school today?
-Crisp.

25:13.013 --> 25:14.515
And, you make any friends?

25:14.598 --> 25:16.517
Yeah, met a few youths from yard.

25:16.975 --> 25:17.809
Cat.

25:18.560 --> 25:21.438
I don't want you mixed up
with them Jamaicans over here, now.

25:21.522 --> 25:25.776
Because all they do is get themselves
in trouble and sell drugs.

25:26.735 --> 25:30.864
Mama tell you something, I didn't send all
the way to Jamaica for you to come here

25:30.948 --> 25:33.033
for you to get yourself in trouble
in these people country.

25:33.116 --> 25:35.202
They will lock you up
and throw away the key.

25:35.285 --> 25:37.120
Carol, I'm not laughing.
This is serious business.

25:37.204 --> 25:39.998
Alright, I will not make
nothing but Yankee friend then.

25:42.125 --> 25:43.293
They're worst.

25:43.877 --> 25:46.463
All they do is kill each other
everyday over nothing.

25:46.547 --> 25:48.715
Then it is the same thing in Jamaica.

25:49.758 --> 25:52.010
Uh-uh. No, it is not.

25:52.636 --> 25:54.012
It is different.

25:54.096 --> 25:59.017
I raised you to be
a respectable, decent young man.

25:59.518 --> 26:01.395
Who have respect for women.

26:01.478 --> 26:03.063
I raised you to be a real man.

26:03.647 --> 26:05.774
That's how I raised you.
It's not the same.

26:07.067 --> 26:08.068
So what, then?

26:08.986 --> 26:11.864
You want me to keep the Yankee friend
or my Jamaican friend?

26:15.075 --> 26:16.785
It's better you keep the Jamaican friends.

26:18.370 --> 26:20.163
At least you can
trust them a little better

26:20.247 --> 26:21.915
than the Yankee boys, then. Hmm.

26:22.666 --> 26:23.500
Hmm.

26:27.546 --> 26:28.380
Hmm.

26:37.514 --> 26:39.725
-What the fuck is up now, nigga?
-You don't know me, boy.

26:39.808 --> 26:41.602
Nigga, I told you this shit wasn't over.

26:41.685 --> 26:43.437
Bumbaclaat, the fuck is going on here?

26:43.520 --> 26:45.397
Stay out of this, this shit
ain't got nothing to do with you.

26:45.480 --> 26:47.608
Suck your mother's pussy,
this is my brother.

26:47.691 --> 26:49.776
-Trust.
-You think I ain't going to do nothing?

27:14.676 --> 27:16.303
That bruise looks bad.

27:16.386 --> 27:19.097
If this looks bad you should've
seen the boy Shawn's face.

27:19.181 --> 27:22.351
-Oh, man.

27:22.434 --> 27:24.645
-You crazy.
-He started it.

27:26.980 --> 27:29.566
So do they have burgers in Jamaica?

27:29.650 --> 27:32.152
-They're the best.
-Yeah, right.

27:32.236 --> 27:35.113
I'm serious, Jamaicans invented
the burger. You didn't know?

27:35.781 --> 27:38.492
-What's it made of, oxtail and curry?

27:38.575 --> 27:40.202
-And jerk seasoning.
-Yeah!

27:43.288 --> 27:44.289
You're funny.

27:46.583 --> 27:48.252
Did you go to the college seminar?

27:48.335 --> 27:49.253
Yeah, I went.

27:51.213 --> 27:52.798
And what colleges did you pick?

27:53.632 --> 27:55.259
I signed up for the Marines.

27:55.342 --> 27:56.385
Cat, are you crazy?

27:57.886 --> 28:01.598
As opposed to taking out a loan and going
to college, you rather face death?

28:02.432 --> 28:04.977
People dying today that never died before.

28:47.477 --> 28:48.812
Oh, my God!

28:48.896 --> 28:52.191
Look at my son. Oh, God! Look at my son.

28:54.276 --> 28:55.277
-Welcome home.
-Yo.

28:55.360 --> 28:56.445
What's going on?

28:59.865 --> 29:01.700
-Keep this, you know.

29:01.783 --> 29:05.120
This is rice and peas? Taste like
fried rice from the Chinese man.

29:05.204 --> 29:09.458
Cat, she swear she can cook.
Don't bother her too much, man, she tries.

29:09.541 --> 29:11.251
-Mama.

29:11.335 --> 29:13.712
-Yes, baby?
-What you want to talk to me about?

29:13.795 --> 29:15.923
Lord Jesus, Cat, man. That can wait.

29:16.006 --> 29:18.592
-You just came home, man, eat up.

29:18.675 --> 29:19.885
Eat up your food.

29:19.968 --> 29:21.637
I don't think it can wait, Mommy.

29:25.766 --> 29:27.184
She have multiple myeloma.

29:27.893 --> 29:28.727
What's that?

29:29.645 --> 29:31.188
-It's a cancer.
-What?

29:34.525 --> 29:35.567
Cancer?

29:38.237 --> 29:40.822
What… how come I'm just hearing this?

29:41.740 --> 29:44.368
Cat, sorry you have to
come home to news like this.

29:44.451 --> 29:46.119
What are the doctors saying?

29:47.204 --> 29:48.121
Hmm?

29:48.997 --> 29:50.707
They told her she gotta have chemo.

29:52.042 --> 29:54.211
After that, she would need
a bone marrow transplant.

29:57.005 --> 29:59.299
But it's money we are worried about.

29:59.383 --> 30:01.635
The insurance is not
going to cover all of it.

30:02.302 --> 30:04.596
Carol, let's talk about something else,
now, baby, please?

30:04.680 --> 30:07.099
We have to find ways to raise money!

30:07.182 --> 30:08.976
What in the world did I just say, Carol?

30:09.059 --> 30:11.103
Come on, Mama, sit down, sit down.

30:13.230 --> 30:14.064
Um...

30:16.233 --> 30:19.903
Now that you home,
what do you plan for the baby?

30:19.987 --> 30:21.697
Don't worry about that, Mama.

30:22.447 --> 30:24.825
I'll just go on the G.I. bill
and get a job.

30:25.742 --> 30:27.703
You need to go by to the Fresh Food.

30:27.786 --> 30:30.998
Mr. Brown still working
up there and he is the manager.

30:32.040 --> 30:33.792
He knows all about you, you know.

30:33.876 --> 30:35.961
Because I used to always brag about you.

30:36.044 --> 30:37.921
You're going to send him
to work with that man, then?

30:38.463 --> 30:40.507
You know he is rude and disrespectful.

30:41.049 --> 30:44.970
Everybody know Mr. Brown rude and
disrespectful and turn bad already, Carol.

30:45.846 --> 30:48.223
You can work around it, baby. Go up there.

30:49.349 --> 30:52.644
And if you go up there,
I will let you use the car.

30:53.270 --> 30:54.271
Alright?

31:32.100 --> 31:34.895
-You're up early.
-Yeah.

31:34.978 --> 31:36.480
I have to go look for work.

31:38.524 --> 31:40.108
You just got home.

31:41.693 --> 31:43.612
-Can't you rest for a day?
-Nah.

31:44.655 --> 31:46.490
I just found out that my mom's sick.

31:48.283 --> 31:50.077
Oh, my God, what's wrong with her?

31:50.953 --> 31:52.246
She have cancer.

31:53.455 --> 31:54.331
Oh, Cat.

31:54.414 --> 31:56.208
She need money for the surgery

31:56.291 --> 31:57.876
after her chemo treatment.

31:59.628 --> 32:01.505
I'm so sorry. I had no idea.

32:04.716 --> 32:05.843
How can I help?

32:07.010 --> 32:08.262
I don't know.

32:15.394 --> 32:17.020
We’re gonna figure it out, okay?

32:19.147 --> 32:21.567
Hey. I love you.

32:23.527 --> 32:24.653
I love you too.

32:45.382 --> 32:48.093
You're hired.
But one slip-up and you're fired.

32:48.177 --> 32:50.304
-Do you understand me?
-Yes, sir.

32:50.387 --> 32:54.683
-Good. Be here at- 00 a.m. sharp.
-Yes, sir.

32:56.101 --> 32:57.102
You can go.

33:00.522 --> 33:03.358
-You sure you don't want that one?
-Yeah, man, I'm sure.

33:03.442 --> 33:04.985
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

33:06.195 --> 33:08.155
Yo. Who this?

33:08.238 --> 33:10.199
The original gangster from the lane.

33:10.282 --> 33:12.826
Bumbaclaat, it's Cat on the phone.

33:12.910 --> 33:18.040
-Bumbaclaat.
-What's going on, General?

33:18.123 --> 33:20.709
-Big up the g-star.
-Big up the bossman.

33:20.792 --> 33:23.212
Yo, go on play that for me.

33:23.295 --> 33:24.671
Understand.

33:24.755 --> 33:26.215
Cat, what's going on, my brother?

33:26.298 --> 33:27.925
Ah, everything good, man.

33:28.008 --> 33:29.343
I have to do what I have to do.

33:30.093 --> 33:31.220
Um, how the family?

33:31.803 --> 33:34.348
You know how things are
over here, nothing has changed.

33:34.431 --> 33:36.558
Yeah, man, I know.
Streets will never change.

33:36.642 --> 33:38.602
-What's going on, Bingey?
-I'm here, brother.

33:38.685 --> 33:40.687
You good? Cat is on the phone, you know.

33:40.771 --> 33:41.605
Say hello for me, thanks.

33:41.688 --> 33:44.107
-Yeah, man, Bingey said hello.
-Bless bless.

33:44.816 --> 33:46.527
So you didn't call General?

33:46.610 --> 33:48.153
Nah, I just came home from the Marines.

33:48.237 --> 33:49.988
I am trying to keep things
in order right now.

33:50.072 --> 33:51.406
You should call General, man.

33:51.490 --> 33:54.868
Remember where you come from. Remember
loyalty over everything, you know.

33:54.952 --> 33:56.662
Yeah. I remember, but...

33:57.746 --> 34:00.541
Things tough out there. A real struggle.

34:00.624 --> 34:01.875
A nigga broke.

34:01.959 --> 34:03.293
What you mean you broke?

34:03.377 --> 34:05.254
So why don't you go on a jux, my youth?

34:05.754 --> 34:07.589
You have to respect the jux, you know.

34:08.674 --> 34:09.757
Like we bring you in, you know.

34:09.842 --> 34:11.217
Yo, hold on, hold on.

34:11.717 --> 34:12.678
I did nothing, I did nothing.

34:12.761 --> 34:14.554
I did nothing, I did nothing.

34:14.638 --> 34:16.431
I did nothing, I did nothing.

34:22.563 --> 34:24.731
Ya'll, back up. Back up.

34:24.815 --> 34:26.400
-Hey, dred.

34:30.987 --> 34:32.656
-Hold that idiot.

34:48.380 --> 34:49.965

34:50.799 --> 34:52.384
The fuck you mean, what he doing here?

34:52.467 --> 34:53.467
I told you it's a three men job,

34:53.552 --> 34:55.053
obviously dude makes four.

34:55.804 --> 34:57.264
Hey, boy, you bugging out. You know.

34:58.307 --> 34:59.641
You need to chill the fuck out.

34:59.725 --> 35:01.643
Not to mention my nephew is official.

35:02.311 --> 35:04.229
I don't give a fuck how
official you say this bird is.

35:04.313 --> 35:05.939
-I don't know him.
-What?

35:06.023 --> 35:07.649
You bitch ass nigga,

35:07.733 --> 35:08.734
-after all I have done for you?
-Chris.

35:08.817 --> 35:10.819
Easy, man, calm yourself, brother.

35:11.361 --> 35:14.823
Remember he is only one
with info about the jux.

35:14.907 --> 35:16.325
Remember that you know.

35:16.867 --> 35:17.910
Look.

35:18.702 --> 35:21.205
All he is looking for is rent
money, man. Ain't nothing major.

35:21.663 --> 35:22.497
Some bullshit.

35:22.581 --> 35:23.790
Fucking shit.

35:23.874 --> 35:26.210
Nigga, think straight,
and stop acting greedy, man.

35:26.293 --> 35:28.462
We need James to come.

35:29.213 --> 35:31.548
That way the nigga don't see your face.

35:33.217 --> 35:35.469
Alright, but I don't appreciate
ya'll niggas attitude.

35:35.552 --> 35:37.763
Yo, we going to do this or what?
Or you want to get this money?

35:39.890 --> 35:40.891
Alright, bet.

35:42.267 --> 35:44.811
Slime's nephew, walks the dog around nine.

35:57.366 --> 35:59.117
-Ah, what?
-Stay the fuck down,

35:59.201 --> 36:00.661
before I blow both of ya'll brains out.

36:01.328 --> 36:02.871
You. Move your ass over here.

36:02.955 --> 36:04.581
Keep your hands where I can see them.

36:05.415 --> 36:06.458
Get the fuck up.

36:08.377 --> 36:09.753
Push him to the bathroom.

36:15.300 --> 36:17.344
Ahh! Thirsty. Hurry up.

36:18.387 --> 36:20.305
Put him in the tub and get in after him.

36:37.823 --> 36:38.866
Mama.

36:38.949 --> 36:40.951
-Go lay down.
-Hey, baby.

36:41.577 --> 36:43.662
Going to cook something for you to eat.

36:43.745 --> 36:45.289

36:45.372 --> 36:47.624
-Come, I'm take care of you.
-After I cook something.

36:47.708 --> 36:49.501
-Don't worry about it.
-You didn't eat nothing all day.

36:49.585 --> 36:51.587
Don't worry, I will eat at work, come.

36:51.670 --> 36:53.505
You eat a lot of junk food.

36:53.589 --> 36:55.757
Don't worry about it, just come now.

36:55.841 --> 36:59.178
-Ah, baby, I want you to eat, you know.
-I want you to rest.

37:00.929 --> 37:02.598
Alright, bet. That's yours.

37:03.682 --> 37:05.934
-You already know. That's you.
-Ha-ha.

37:09.980 --> 37:12.441

Rent money, nigga, that's exactly

You needed rent money,

37:16.403 --> 37:17.613

-Nah, nah, nah.

37:17.696 --> 37:20.657

37:35.756 --> 37:38.634
Fuck, okay, okay.
This shit is crazy. Okay, okay.

37:38.717 --> 37:40.928

You want to do it fair, I'mma do it fair.

37:41.011 --> 37:43.263
I don't what the hell

38:04.076 --> 38:05.536

38:09.623 --> 38:11.834
Yo. What's up, man?

38:17.339 --> 38:19.883
I don’t want you to feel no type

38:19.967 --> 38:21.844
After all the shit ya’ll niggas pull,

That's it, nigga, that's what you want?

Alright.

Yo.

39:00.215 --> 39:02.968
-Yo, you see the fight last night?
-I don't have cable.

39:03.051 --> 39:05.220
Me too, went to the bar to watch it.

39:05.304 --> 39:07.347
-I heard it was good.
-Yeah, man, it was good.

39:08.223 --> 39:11.018
-You don't get out much?
-Ah, it's not in my budget.

39:11.101 --> 39:12.686
What's going on here?

39:12.769 --> 39:14.646
Some type of social event or work?

39:15.814 --> 39:18.859
I got a goddam spill in the juice aisle.

39:18.942 --> 39:21.820
You two, get y'all asses there, clean up.

39:24.740 --> 39:26.700
Fucking asshole.

39:26.783 --> 39:28.869
If I didn't need this job,
I swear I would knock him out.

39:36.335 --> 39:37.252
Watch out.

39:38.420 --> 39:39.421
Yo, watch out.

39:49.556 --> 39:52.518
Oh, shit! My nigga, Cat.

39:53.185 --> 39:54.770
Mopping and shit.

39:55.854 --> 39:58.565
Oh, man, this where you work at?

40:00.692 --> 40:03.153
Yo, that's crazy.

40:04.404 --> 40:07.533
You know, I seen your bitch Karen
out in the parking lot, right?

40:07.616 --> 40:11.161
She still looks good, man.
I still wouldn't mind hitting that.

40:11.245 --> 40:13.664
Yo, are you trying to start some
bloodclaat problem at my job?

40:16.667 --> 40:19.586
Nah, man. I ain't-- I'm not
trying to start no trouble.

40:19.670 --> 40:21.255
As a matter of fact, man, you know what?

40:21.338 --> 40:24.007
Today, today I'm in--
I'm in a good mood today, man.

40:24.091 --> 40:26.468
I'm in a really good mood today.

40:27.094 --> 40:28.762
And ah, you know what?

40:33.016 --> 40:34.393
Consider it a peace treaty.

40:35.394 --> 40:37.980
No more beef. Alright?

40:38.689 --> 40:40.983
From me to you. Alright?

40:42.234 --> 40:44.194
Why don't you pick
that shit off the floor?

40:46.446 --> 40:47.990
Bitch broke ass nigga.

40:49.533 --> 40:51.243
You should've kept your ass in Jamaica.

40:51.326 --> 40:53.036
You might've been a manager by now.

40:55.080 --> 40:56.498
You missed a spot.

40:57.040 --> 40:59.459
Now here I am swinging a damn mop,

40:59.543 --> 41:02.087
fresh outta Uncle Sam's Marines.

41:02.171 --> 41:04.548
And blowing shit up
in the name of the flag.

41:05.549 --> 41:07.467
My mother is sick, I’m broke,

41:07.551 --> 41:09.678
and this piece of shit flashing

41:09.761 --> 41:11.513
and throws money in my face.

41:13.182 --> 41:15.017
What did he think would happen next?

41:37.873 --> 41:39.958
When your back is up against the wall,

41:40.042 --> 41:42.252
it don’t take much for someone

41:42.336 --> 41:45.005
or something to get to that turning point.

41:45.088 --> 41:47.549
Trigger you to do some bullshit.

41:47.633 --> 41:49.593
Not because you want to,

41:49.676 --> 41:53.013
but because that’s what
the situation calls for.

41:53.096 --> 41:56.975
Disrespect is disrespect,
there’s no other way to look at it.

41:57.768 --> 42:01.647
Someone disrespect me,
I do something about it.

42:55.826 --> 42:57.744
Yo, what the fuck is--

42:59.580 --> 43:02.416
Turn the fuck over and put your
bloodclaat hand behind your head.

43:02.916 --> 43:05.169
Alright, man, relax. Relax.

43:05.252 --> 43:07.212
Alright, just relax.

43:09.423 --> 43:11.383
Take whatever you need, man, just take it.

43:12.759 --> 43:14.553
Don't do this man, please.

43:18.265 --> 43:20.142
Just take what you need,
don't kill us, man.

43:35.908 --> 43:38.160
-Yo, take it, easy, man.

43:38.243 --> 43:39.620
Get the fuck off me!

43:39.703 --> 43:42.998
Ah! Fuck, fuck.

43:43.081 --> 43:45.292
-She ain't do nothing, man.
-Damn.

43:47.753 --> 43:48.629
Fuck!

43:55.344 --> 43:57.346
Oh, fuck!

43:57.429 --> 43:59.890
Shut up your bloodclaat,
before I kill you and your girl.

43:59.973 --> 44:02.267
-My nose, man.
-Where is the money at?

44:04.770 --> 44:05.646
Cat?

44:08.398 --> 44:11.693
Again. Where is the
bloodclatt money and jewelry?

44:11.777 --> 44:13.862
-It's in the bottom drawer!
-Which bottom drawer?

44:13.946 --> 44:16.073
The dresser, man.
The bottom drawer.

44:25.249 --> 44:26.708
You fucking with me?

44:27.543 --> 44:29.628
It's under the bottom panel, it's there.

44:32.339 --> 44:34.508
Oh!

44:34.591 --> 44:36.468
You're a big man, eh?

44:40.305 --> 44:42.391
Stacks y'all deal with.

44:54.611 --> 44:55.612
What?

44:58.031 --> 45:00.659
This is the kind of jewelry
y'all work with? Eh?

45:13.797 --> 45:14.756
Cat.

45:15.716 --> 45:18.594
-We just got an eviction notice.
-What?

45:23.307 --> 45:26.059
And the medical bill is over 30 grand.

45:26.143 --> 45:27.978
She owe 30 grand already?

45:33.650 --> 45:34.735
Where are y'all go?

45:44.036 --> 45:46.788
That is enough for the bills
and pay the rent.

45:46.872 --> 45:48.749
I'll work on something for the surgery.

45:52.753 --> 45:55.047
Oh, bumba... Cat.

45:55.756 --> 45:57.424
Where you get this money from?

45:57.508 --> 45:59.760
Since when you start asking questions?

45:59.843 --> 46:01.553
Just take care of the bills.

46:05.766 --> 46:07.809
-If you say so.
-I have to talk to Mommy.

46:16.485 --> 46:18.946
Come in. Oh, God, Cat.

46:19.613 --> 46:21.573
I don't like it when you see me like this.

46:21.657 --> 46:23.033
Don't worry about that.

46:23.116 --> 46:25.661
Always going to be
the prettiest girl in the world.

46:25.744 --> 46:27.996
You're full of too much sweet talk.

46:32.417 --> 46:34.670
-So, how do you feel?
-Tired.

46:36.547 --> 46:39.716
Mama has to
get better and go to work,

46:39.800 --> 46:41.677
don't know how I'm going to do it.

46:44.096 --> 46:47.349
The people up there, some are so racist.

46:48.517 --> 46:50.602
They just work me out.

46:53.480 --> 46:55.899
I'm not saying they all like that, babe,

46:55.983 --> 46:58.902
but you have one old bastard up there.

46:59.486 --> 47:01.697
Jesus, he is the worst.

47:01.780 --> 47:03.156
You have to leave that and rest now.

47:03.240 --> 47:04.867
-And do what?
-Nothing.

47:05.701 --> 47:07.995
Let me take care of you
and get you out of the ghetto.

47:08.078 --> 47:10.497
-How you plan to do that?
-Don't worry about it.

47:11.415 --> 47:16.086
-I'll figure it out.
-Yeah? Yeah?

47:16.170 --> 47:17.796
The only thing I need to do

47:17.880 --> 47:20.424
is get better
and go to these people's work.

47:21.592 --> 47:23.302
The American Dream, huh?

47:24.136 --> 47:26.597
Work hard and have nothing to show for it.

47:29.099 --> 47:31.643
What would you like me to do?
You have a better plan?

47:32.895 --> 47:36.315
You want me to go beg?
Or want me to be a thief?

47:37.274 --> 47:40.485
Or you want me to go to the streets
and sell drugs like the dirty Americans?

47:40.569 --> 47:42.446
Which one of them? Huh?

47:42.529 --> 47:45.032
So it's good to live in America
and not be an American?

47:51.455 --> 47:52.581
I have to run.

48:07.346 --> 48:10.307
Hey... Am I late for our date?

48:10.390 --> 48:13.435
Nah, but I can't go,
I have something to deal with.

48:13.519 --> 48:16.021
-Are you serious?
-Promise, this weekend we do something.

48:16.104 --> 48:18.315
-This weekend, what about today?
-Look.

48:18.398 --> 48:21.026
-I have some things--
-No, no, no, no, forget it, Cat.

48:21.109 --> 48:23.779
-Forget what?
-I was lonely while you were gone,

48:23.862 --> 48:25.489
and I won't be lonely while you're here.

48:25.572 --> 48:26.782
Karen!

48:38.293 --> 48:40.045
I don't like none of these.

48:40.128 --> 48:42.339
-You didn't like that Jag over there?
-Nah, man.

48:42.422 --> 48:43.924
Need something better than that.

48:44.758 --> 48:46.343
You said you were paying cash, right?

48:48.762 --> 48:52.558
Matter of fact, I got something
that came in just yesterday.

48:52.641 --> 48:55.435
Cost a little bit more and
a little bit different, but...

48:55.519 --> 48:57.771
-You like yellow?
-I'm Jamaican.

48:57.855 --> 49:00.190
Alright, cool, trust me,
you're going to love this one.

49:00.274 --> 49:01.900
I got it right over there.
Take a look with me.

49:24.840 --> 49:26.175
When you’re from the ghetto

49:26.258 --> 49:28.510
and you finally get your
hands on that money bag.

49:29.511 --> 49:32.181
You go back to the ghetto
and put on your people.

49:32.931 --> 49:35.100
You only feel right, if you’re real.

49:35.767 --> 49:39.062
In my case, you start your own gang.

49:57.748 --> 49:58.957
Yo. My youth.

49:59.750 --> 50:03.420
-Come clean my car for me, no?
-Bumbaclaat.

50:03.504 --> 50:05.339
What the fuck going on here?
Brother, is this you?

50:05.422 --> 50:07.716
Yeah. And we need to talk.

50:08.342 --> 50:09.384
So talk, my brother.

50:09.468 --> 50:12.304
All you have to do is say,
"Fuck this job" and take a ride.

50:12.971 --> 50:15.557
Fuck this job, let's ride.

50:15.641 --> 50:17.142
Alright, come now.

50:29.613 --> 50:30.781
Read that sign.

50:30.864 --> 50:32.658
"Trust is a luxury

50:32.741 --> 50:34.326
most can't afford.

50:34.910 --> 50:37.162
Betrayal is an act that can't be ignored.

50:37.955 --> 50:40.791
Death may be the result
of ignoring the two."

50:40.874 --> 50:43.168
That is what The Order is all about.

50:43.252 --> 50:45.254
As a member, you live and die by it.

50:54.680 --> 50:56.014
This chain here...

50:56.723 --> 50:59.434
...represent the doors
the Order will open for you.

51:08.986 --> 51:11.488
Place your right hand on
the bible and repeat after me.

51:16.034 --> 51:20.330
-I swear to uphold the Order.
-I swear to uphold the Order.

51:20.414 --> 51:22.624
To honor and obey its codes.

51:22.708 --> 51:25.085
To honor and obey its codes.

51:25.169 --> 51:28.088
And to choose death before betrayal.

51:30.591 --> 51:33.093
And to choose death before betrayal.

51:37.222 --> 51:41.894
This bullet will kill you
if you ever betray the Order.

51:42.728 --> 51:45.606
Or kill anyone who betrays the Order.

51:47.357 --> 51:48.734
Give me your right hand.

52:05.375 --> 52:07.252
We are bonded by bloodshed.

52:08.170 --> 52:11.048
And separated only by bloodshed.

52:14.718 --> 52:16.303
Welcome to the Order.

52:16.386 --> 52:18.055
-Respect, brother.
-Yeah, dog.

52:18.138 --> 52:19.139
Yeah!

52:19.723 --> 52:21.767
Now we have to get Prince
and Ozzie down with us.

52:21.850 --> 52:24.520
Those boys been robbing for a long time.

52:24.603 --> 52:25.771
-Yeah?
-Yeah, man.

52:25.854 --> 52:27.940
Good then, they will fit right in.

52:28.023 --> 52:30.317
Alright, I have a few things lined up,
so we have to move right now.

52:30.400 --> 52:31.527
Alright, I will call them later.

52:31.610 --> 52:32.694
Alright, good.

52:38.075 --> 52:39.701
-Revolver?
-Yeah, man.

52:40.661 --> 52:43.163
That way, we never
leave any bullets behind.

52:44.164 --> 52:45.916
Everybody must have the same gun.

52:46.542 --> 52:49.169
That means, if I shoot a man,

52:49.253 --> 52:51.505
everybody has to shoot that person too.

52:52.256 --> 52:56.176
That way, nobody can tell
who killed that person.

52:57.553 --> 53:00.347
Bumbaclaat... Dog.

53:00.430 --> 53:02.432
Alright. Yeah, man.

53:03.392 --> 53:04.309
Come.

53:31.920 --> 53:32.963
Smell good.

53:36.216 --> 53:37.217
Finish him.

53:53.817 --> 53:55.235
Bandit, my main man.

53:56.028 --> 53:57.196
What do you got for me?

54:02.826 --> 54:05.412
Come in the back. Joe, cover for me.

54:08.457 --> 54:11.001
Where the fuck did you get all this?

54:11.084 --> 54:13.128
-From Jah.

54:13.212 --> 54:15.422
I just like to know
what I am working with.

54:15.506 --> 54:17.799
Listen. All you need to know is that

54:17.883 --> 54:20.010
you cannot sell it in New York, see?

54:21.220 --> 54:23.263
In that case, no fucking problem.

54:23.347 --> 54:24.932
I will send it to my brother in Atlanta.

54:25.015 --> 54:26.141
Cool.

54:27.726 --> 54:30.020
Keep it up. Bandit, keep it up.

54:32.064 --> 54:34.316
Looks like you just bought
yourself a new Rolex, huh?

54:34.399 --> 54:35.859
Talking to dead bodies now?

54:44.826 --> 54:46.537
Looks like the next stop is the pawnshop.

54:46.620 --> 54:48.747
Time to find the killer
who killed the killer.

54:49.831 --> 54:51.250
Talk about job security.

54:58.340 --> 55:01.134
I'm going to call her later.
What else is happening?

55:07.391 --> 55:09.101
Just tell her I borrowed it or something.

55:10.769 --> 55:12.938
Then tell her I won the lottery.

55:13.814 --> 55:15.190
Yo, I have to run.

55:16.275 --> 55:17.901
-What's going on, General?
-What's up?

55:20.487 --> 55:24.283
-I dumped the jewelry on Bobby.
-Nice. What happened to the works?

55:24.366 --> 55:27.077
I got rid of eight to ten bricks
at 32 a pop.

55:27.619 --> 55:30.289
My nephew James, he got the other two.
He going to break them down,

55:30.372 --> 55:31.915
should be done in the next couple of days.

55:31.999 --> 55:32.833
Alright.

55:34.793 --> 55:37.045
Good evening, gentlemen,
what can I get for you tonight?

55:38.046 --> 55:41.091
-Uh, get me the same thing as him.
-Okay.

55:41.175 --> 55:42.676
And what can I get for you, sir?

55:45.637 --> 55:47.472
-Jerk chicken.
-I'm sorry,

55:47.556 --> 55:49.766
but we don't serve jerk chicken here.

55:50.559 --> 55:53.187
-Why not?
-Because this isn't a Jamaican--

55:53.270 --> 55:55.606
Just bring everybody
the same thing I'm having.

55:55.689 --> 55:57.608
Okay, no problem. I'll be back.

56:00.402 --> 56:02.321
-Yo, what happened to James?
-Yeah, I been meaning to talk to you

56:02.404 --> 56:03.989
about putting him down or something.

56:04.615 --> 56:07.492
You like James. Bring him
and let me see where he fits in.

56:08.660 --> 56:12.289
After that, I have a job I have
been working on for a while now.

56:12.372 --> 56:15.626
This man is the middle man
for a Chinese drug dealer.

56:15.709 --> 56:18.837
Customs at JFK signs off
on anything they need.

56:19.838 --> 56:22.466
His problem is he likes fucking strippers

56:22.549 --> 56:23.842
and telling them his business.

56:25.969 --> 56:28.138
Yo, so let us do this. What's the plan?

56:28.222 --> 56:30.766
Alright, come. I am going to give you
this man's phone number.

56:48.784 --> 56:50.202
Can I help you, gentlemen?

56:52.454 --> 56:54.039
We are looking for this watch.

56:58.126 --> 56:59.795
Nothing like that here.

57:03.131 --> 57:06.635
-Any guns for sale?
-That's illegal in New York City.

57:06.718 --> 57:08.637
And I run a clean pawnshop here.

57:08.720 --> 57:10.806
You know, I bet you never met someone

57:11.348 --> 57:13.851
with superpowers before today.

57:14.852 --> 57:20.691
I look at someone and my powers
tell me this motherfucker is lying.

57:22.234 --> 57:24.987
Hold up, what? It's saying, it's saying

57:25.070 --> 57:28.282
the two guys who walked
out here, before we walked in,

57:28.365 --> 57:30.158
sold you an illegal gun.

57:32.703 --> 57:37.749
So now all I have to do is
get a warrant and find the gun.

57:37.833 --> 57:43.172
Lock you up and put you
out of business for good!

57:46.300 --> 57:49.428
Okay, maybe I have a watch
that looks like that.

57:49.511 --> 57:51.889
You hear that? Maybe he's got
a watch that looks like that.

57:51.972 --> 57:54.349
That's-- May I see it, please?

58:05.110 --> 58:06.445
I'm going to need more than that.

58:07.279 --> 58:09.740
It's just not enough, man.
I mean, all we got

58:09.823 --> 58:12.326
is receiving stolen property,
if he doesn't talk.

58:15.245 --> 58:16.788
I don't think he is going to talk.

58:19.958 --> 58:21.793
We need something
to bring this all together.

58:23.462 --> 58:24.421
You know what?

58:25.506 --> 58:27.132
Go get Paul. Call him in here.

58:28.383 --> 58:29.676
I think I got an idea.

58:43.982 --> 58:46.693
Sir. I need you to step out of the car.

58:46.777 --> 58:50.030
But... why? I'm not coming out
of my bumbaclaat car.

58:50.113 --> 58:52.783
Step out of the fucking car, motherfucker!

58:57.788 --> 58:59.540
You, let's go. Phone call time.

59:00.123 --> 59:01.333
Let's go, move it!

59:01.416 --> 59:03.126
I don't got all day, let's go.

59:07.589 --> 59:08.966
Yo, let's go!

59:42.916 --> 59:46.086
Brother. You call me
when I'm in my birthday suit,

59:46.170 --> 59:48.213
and cutting two cakes.

59:48.297 --> 59:51.508
Yo, my dog.
Police have me at central booking.

59:52.217 --> 59:54.178
-For what?
-They pull me over

59:54.261 --> 59:55.554
for some license shit.

59:55.637 --> 59:58.473
And they come tow my car,
so I need a ride, yes?

59:58.974 --> 1:00:01.435
A lie. Alright.

1:00:01.518 --> 1:00:02.519
Ah, cool, hurry up.

1:00:03.020 --> 1:00:04.021
I'll step on it.

1:00:07.441 --> 1:00:09.526
Like, really, Ozzie? What the fuck?

1:00:10.194 --> 1:00:11.945
You really going to get up and leave.

1:00:12.029 --> 1:00:13.947
I brought a sexy girl for you
to have a threesome.

1:00:14.031 --> 1:00:15.449
Tanya, I have to leave.

1:00:15.532 --> 1:00:17.659
Please, don't make her leave.

1:00:17.743 --> 1:00:19.119
I will be back soon.

1:00:19.203 --> 1:00:21.205
You know what, Ozzie, fuck you!

1:00:21.288 --> 1:00:23.248
And don't come back to my house either.

1:00:23.832 --> 1:00:26.210
-Could you believe this nigga?
-I love you.

1:00:33.133 --> 1:00:35.010
Yo, what you bump me for, nigga?

1:00:35.093 --> 1:00:36.845
Pussy, what the fuck you talking about?

1:00:44.603 --> 1:00:46.980
Fucking asshole, break that
shit up. Break that shit up.

1:00:47.064 --> 1:00:49.024
Sit the fuck down, you fucking animals.

1:00:49.107 --> 1:00:50.984
Yo, you two assholes, let's go.

1:00:51.068 --> 1:00:53.487
-Get out!
-Bumbaclaat, man.

1:00:53.570 --> 1:00:56.490
-What fuck is going on here?
-Come on, man, what the fuck is going on?

1:00:56.573 --> 1:00:57.658
That pussy.

1:00:58.408 --> 1:00:59.284
Get the fuck out.

1:00:59.368 --> 1:01:00.410
You're dead.

1:01:02.996 --> 1:01:04.122
Bumbaclaat.

1:01:08.544 --> 1:01:10.796
Yo, respect. Thanks.

1:01:11.588 --> 1:01:13.090
Ain't shit.

1:01:13.173 --> 1:01:15.717
Hate when weak ass niggas
need a mob to fuck up one nigga.

1:01:17.886 --> 1:01:19.429
Bumbaclaat.

1:01:25.018 --> 1:01:26.103
Respect.

1:01:28.021 --> 1:01:30.023
Fucking pussy bitches.

1:01:30.816 --> 1:01:32.943
Fuck, I want to--

1:01:35.153 --> 1:01:37.865
Fucking police boy pull me over.

1:01:37.948 --> 1:01:39.992
And took me to the precinct.

1:01:40.075 --> 1:01:42.911
Just to find out my license
is not even suspended, dog.

1:01:42.995 --> 1:01:45.914
What? That's some bullshit,
you know that, right?

1:01:45.998 --> 1:01:48.750
-Fuckers.
-The boys try to meet their quota.

1:01:48.834 --> 1:01:51.461
Yo, listen. Fuck the police!

1:01:51.545 --> 1:01:54.214
I want to tell the whole NYPD
to go suck their mother.

1:01:56.717 --> 1:01:58.552
Alright. Listen to this.

1:02:00.637 --> 1:02:03.056
We have to speed up things
and line up some more jux.

1:02:03.140 --> 1:02:05.350
-Yo.
-We have to get some more money.

1:02:05.434 --> 1:02:06.852
That's what I want to hear, dog.

1:02:06.935 --> 1:02:07.811
Yeah, man.

1:02:08.395 --> 1:02:10.898
Look, I'm going to need two more
of you to take care of things.

1:02:10.981 --> 1:02:14.318
We already have James, so one
more youth we're gonna need.

1:02:14.401 --> 1:02:17.654
Yo, I think I know somebody
who I can bring to the team.

1:02:17.738 --> 1:02:18.780
Who is that?

1:02:18.864 --> 1:02:20.991
It's a brother I just met
at central booking.

1:02:21.074 --> 1:02:23.368
Alright, bring him
so I can meet him first.

1:02:23.452 --> 1:02:25.954
-I can page him later.
-Alright, good.

1:02:27.122 --> 1:02:28.123
Come on, man.

1:02:28.665 --> 1:02:30.709
You know that I smoke smokes
until I'm done.

1:02:36.131 --> 1:02:39.843
You can leave with us
or you can die with him?

1:02:40.344 --> 1:02:43.096
We have to shutdown and
relax until things cool off.

1:02:43.180 --> 1:02:46.975
At this point, things are
way out of control. Fucked up!

1:02:49.520 --> 1:02:52.397
We cannot afford to screw this up.

1:02:52.481 --> 1:02:55.067
-And where the hell is Paul?
-He is on his way.

1:02:55.150 --> 1:02:58.737
-Johnson, call the DA and update them.
-Yes, sir.

1:02:58.820 --> 1:03:01.573
I want these guys
off the streets today.

1:03:02.074 --> 1:03:04.284
It's fight or flight mode
from here on out,

1:03:04.368 --> 1:03:08.497
but with the cops involved,
the fight will be with a gun.

1:03:08.580 --> 1:03:12.626
If I lose, it's
the cemetery or the courtroom.

1:03:12.709 --> 1:03:14.878
Either way, it's not my first choice.

1:03:16.547 --> 1:03:18.131
So for now, I have to take flight.

1:03:20.425 --> 1:03:22.970
Lock 'em down.
Lock 'em down. Lock 'em down.

1:03:23.053 --> 1:03:24.096
Bloodclaat!

1:03:34.898 --> 1:03:36.859
He's on the roof coming down.

1:03:40.195 --> 1:03:42.114
Freeze, don't move.

1:03:52.457 --> 1:03:55.752
-Shut him down, shut him down!

1:04:12.686 --> 1:04:15.898
Bumbaclaat...

1:04:17.566 --> 1:04:19.651
-Fuck you!
-Traitor.

1:04:20.319 --> 1:04:22.196
You forced me to commit murder.

1:04:24.489 --> 1:04:27.618
This ain't personal, just doing my job.

1:04:35.125 --> 1:04:36.502
Damnit, Paul.

1:04:36.585 --> 1:04:39.046
Did you have to kill the only suspect?

1:04:39.671 --> 1:04:40.881
Any bright ideas?

1:04:43.967 --> 1:04:46.094
I think we should
stake out Jameson's wake.

1:04:50.182 --> 1:04:52.017
Yeah, I think so too.

1:05:14.831 --> 1:05:18.126
Shit! My God, Cat, you scared me.

1:05:18.710 --> 1:05:19.711
-I'm sorry.

1:05:20.712 --> 1:05:21.755
We need to talk.

1:05:25.843 --> 1:05:29.805
Nah, Cat, what happen to you?
You changed so much.

1:05:31.849 --> 1:05:33.725
I feel like I don't even know you anymore.

1:05:36.937 --> 1:05:39.189
I don't even see you anymore and...

1:05:40.440 --> 1:05:42.734
...I'm hearing all this
crazy stuff about you.

1:05:49.741 --> 1:05:52.202
-Is it true?
-I don't know.

1:05:53.036 --> 1:05:54.288
I'm not the one that heard it.

1:05:54.955 --> 1:05:57.291
You always know
just what to say, don't you?

1:05:59.418 --> 1:06:01.753
-I thought you loved me.
-I love you.

1:06:03.672 --> 1:06:06.758
I just have to take care of business
to give you what you deserve.

1:06:09.094 --> 1:06:10.179
So now what?

1:06:11.555 --> 1:06:13.182
I have to disappear for a while.

1:06:13.932 --> 1:06:15.642
-What happened?
-Everything will be alright.

1:06:15.726 --> 1:06:16.977
-What happened?
-I just need you to trust me.

1:06:17.060 --> 1:06:18.437
-What happened?
-Please!

1:06:19.229 --> 1:06:20.898
When things are good,
I will be back for you.

1:06:20.981 --> 1:06:22.149
I promise.

1:06:30.824 --> 1:06:33.076
-What's this?
-I will call you on that.

1:06:36.788 --> 1:06:38.999
Just go. Just go.

1:06:44.129 --> 1:06:47.090
-Okay, okay...

1:06:47.174 --> 1:06:50.260
What's going on?
Excuse me-- What's going on?

1:06:50.802 --> 1:06:54.056
Why-- What-- What is going on in my house?

1:06:54.139 --> 1:06:55.182
We are all clear, man.

1:06:55.933 --> 1:06:58.060
Why are you coming
into my house like this?

1:06:58.810 --> 1:07:01.146
-Where is your son?
-He is not here!

1:07:01.230 --> 1:07:02.856
He doesn't live here anymore.

1:07:03.732 --> 1:07:06.693
He's in a lot of trouble. And I want
to bring him in for his own safety,

1:07:06.777 --> 1:07:08.487
so you need to tell me where Cat is.

1:07:09.238 --> 1:07:11.740
I told you he doesn't live here anymore!

1:07:14.451 --> 1:07:16.495
Okay, this is how
this is going to play out.

1:07:16.578 --> 1:07:19.081
These guys are Immigration,
they're gonna take you in

1:07:19.164 --> 1:07:21.041
because your work visa's expired.

1:07:21.959 --> 1:07:23.794
Unless you tell me where Cat is.

1:07:26.004 --> 1:07:29.007
I am not telling you nothing
because I don't know nothing.

1:07:29.091 --> 1:07:30.175
Okay?

1:07:30.259 --> 1:07:31.969
A mother who loves her son

1:07:32.052 --> 1:07:34.972
isn't giving him up to nobody, nobody!

1:07:36.014 --> 1:07:37.432
-Alright.
-Alright.

1:07:38.058 --> 1:07:40.227
-Take her in.
-Turn around, please.

1:07:42.479 --> 1:07:43.689

1:08:04.293 --> 1:08:05.502
Nigga, shit crazy right now.

1:08:05.586 --> 1:08:06.795
I'm about to head to L.I., and lay low.

1:08:06.879 --> 1:08:08.797
-Yeah.
-You should come with me.

1:08:08.881 --> 1:08:11.133

Man, fuck that job, nigga, we hot.

1:08:13.135 --> 1:08:14.386
We got to get the fuck out of here.

1:08:14.469 --> 1:08:16.138
I need that bread, bro.

1:08:16.220 --> 1:08:17.973
Look, I got enough bread
for the both of us.

1:08:18.055 --> 1:08:20.559

1:08:24.979 --> 1:08:27.191
Yeah, I'm sure. Trust, I'm good.

1:08:28.524 --> 1:08:31.028
Alright, fuck it. Do what you got to do.

1:08:31.111 --> 1:08:33.322
But like I said,
I think you should come with me.

1:08:33.404 --> 1:08:35.908
-I'm in these streets, you know that.
-Alright.

1:08:36.658 --> 1:08:38.118
-Alright, stay safe, alright?
-Love.

1:08:38.202 --> 1:08:39.953

That's him.

1:08:46.960 --> 1:08:48.754
That's our guy. Call it in.

1:08:48.837 --> 1:08:51.506
I got a Black male fitting
the description of the suspect.

1:08:53.675 --> 1:08:55.928
Alright, everything is set inside.

1:08:57.179 --> 1:08:59.932
Hey, Paul. Be careful in there.

1:09:45.727 --> 1:09:47.020
Yo, what're you doing here?

1:09:48.397 --> 1:09:49.898
Paying my respects.

1:09:53.402 --> 1:09:56.405
Yo, you know you took
a fucking risk to be here, right?

1:09:57.656 --> 1:09:58.615
I know.

1:09:59.908 --> 1:10:01.493
But I felt like I needed to come.

1:10:04.454 --> 1:10:05.789
What's up, you okay?

1:10:05.873 --> 1:10:08.166
Yeah, man, I'm good.

1:10:09.459 --> 1:10:10.711
What's going on with you?

1:10:11.503 --> 1:10:12.838
Man, I don't know.

1:10:14.673 --> 1:10:16.091
Maybe you can help me.

1:10:16.175 --> 1:10:17.593
With what? What's going on?

1:10:18.177 --> 1:10:19.928
I'm trying to figure out a place to go.

1:10:22.890 --> 1:10:25.058
Damn, we are being rude.
We should talk outside.

1:10:29.563 --> 1:10:31.940
The Midwest is a good place to go,

1:10:32.024 --> 1:10:34.443
'cause the New York boys always run south.

1:10:35.235 --> 1:10:38.280
That's true. What about you?
When you leaving?

1:10:38.363 --> 1:10:42.075
Today, dog. I have to go
somewhere far from here.

1:10:42.701 --> 1:10:44.203
Okay, good luck.

1:10:44.286 --> 1:10:46.914
Bumbaclaat, the police.
What the fuck are you doing?

1:10:46.997 --> 1:10:48.707
Arresting you.

1:10:48.790 --> 1:10:51.168
-You're a fucking police!
-Police, freeze!

1:10:57.591 --> 1:10:59.384
Get down, everybody, get down.

1:11:00.177 --> 1:11:01.595
Don't move, get him!
Get him! Get him!

1:11:01.678 --> 1:11:02.888
Everybody down.

1:11:16.568 --> 1:11:17.486
Where did he go?

1:11:17.569 --> 1:11:18.862
He's over there.

1:11:22.699 --> 1:11:25.953
Yeah, I don't know
what's going on. No, I don't.

1:11:26.828 --> 1:11:28.163
Here's your sister, here.

1:11:28.956 --> 1:11:29.790
Cat.

1:11:30.582 --> 1:11:32.668
The police came and lock Mommy up.

1:11:32.751 --> 1:11:34.294
Lock her up for what?

1:11:34.378 --> 1:11:36.046
Because they are looking for you.

1:11:36.129 --> 1:11:38.924
What the fuck Mama
have to do with my situation?

1:11:39.925 --> 1:11:43.136
Not a thing.
That's why you need to fix this.

1:11:43.220 --> 1:11:47.266
You know that Mommy's sick. I don't know
how they are treating her there.

1:11:47.349 --> 1:11:49.893
-You talk to her?
-She said she is alright.

1:11:50.435 --> 1:11:52.771
So don't turn yourself in,
she didn't tell them nothing.

1:11:53.438 --> 1:11:55.148
Will do it, but let me call you back.

1:11:55.232 --> 1:11:57.651
But you have to see about this, Cat.

1:11:57.734 --> 1:11:59.570
Trust me, I will call you back.

1:11:59.653 --> 1:12:00.988
You have to do something.

1:12:13.542 --> 1:12:15.085
I want to see Gamble.

1:12:16.420 --> 1:12:18.297
-Got a name?
-Cat.

1:12:19.256 --> 1:12:20.132
Follow me.

1:12:26.847 --> 1:12:27.848
Cat.

1:12:28.765 --> 1:12:29.892
Good to see you.

1:12:31.768 --> 1:12:32.895
Come join me.

1:12:34.271 --> 1:12:36.315
-Want a drink?
-No, that's alright.

1:12:37.774 --> 1:12:39.151
-You sure?
-Yeah, man.

1:12:40.277 --> 1:12:43.405
-I heard some things about you, Cat.
-Good or bad?

1:12:43.488 --> 1:12:44.615
Depends on whose side you're on.

1:12:45.282 --> 1:12:46.658
Cops or the robbers.

1:12:49.494 --> 1:12:51.747
-So how can I help you?
-We need a I.D.

1:12:51.830 --> 1:12:54.166
-Okay.
-We need it right away.

1:12:56.460 --> 1:13:00.380
Give me until the weekend.
All I need is two passport photos and...

1:13:00.464 --> 1:13:01.924
That should be all to do the trick.

1:13:02.007 --> 1:13:03.342
I have them right here.

1:13:10.307 --> 1:13:13.060
Like a man that comes to me
with what they want to get what they need.

1:13:13.143 --> 1:13:14.520
How much for that?

1:13:16.688 --> 1:13:19.024
You know, Cat, I'm thinking
more of the lines...

1:13:20.484 --> 1:13:21.735
...you and me doing business.

1:13:23.195 --> 1:13:25.155
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

1:13:25.656 --> 1:13:28.659
Let me help you make
it a little bit more clearer, Cat.

1:13:28.742 --> 1:13:32.329
I know a lot of people.
Hmm? A lot of very...

1:13:33.413 --> 1:13:34.414
...very rich people.

1:13:35.082 --> 1:13:37.334
That's still not saying nothing, my youth.

1:13:38.752 --> 1:13:43.966
Cat, what
I want is the obvious. Okay?

1:13:45.259 --> 1:13:48.178
Rob them. Split the money.

1:13:49.429 --> 1:13:51.014
If you can pull it off.

1:13:51.515 --> 1:13:54.476
So let me understand.

1:13:57.646 --> 1:14:00.399
You want me to rob
your so-called rich friends?

1:14:00.482 --> 1:14:01.859
And split the money.

1:14:03.193 --> 1:14:04.653
If you can pull it off.

1:14:04.736 --> 1:14:06.071
If the information is right,

1:14:06.154 --> 1:14:08.699
we can pull off any bloodclaat thing.

1:14:10.242 --> 1:14:13.871
So, Cat, if I get you
the information you need...

1:14:15.789 --> 1:14:17.165
...what's my cut?

1:14:20.460 --> 1:14:21.587
Equal share.

1:14:26.925 --> 1:14:28.760
Good fucking answer!

1:14:29.970 --> 1:14:31.346
Yo, that's it right there.

1:14:37.102 --> 1:14:39.354
Fuck. We won't make it in time.

1:14:40.105 --> 1:14:42.316
What the fuck are you
talking about, nigga?

1:14:43.567 --> 1:14:46.612
The bridge. We won't get across
before the cops lock it down.

1:14:46.695 --> 1:14:50.657
Man, fuck all that, nigga. All we need
to be worrying about is juxing that bitch.

1:14:51.158 --> 1:14:54.828
Man, juxing is the easy part.
Getting away is the hard part.

1:14:56.205 --> 1:14:57.372
Wait, let me see.

1:14:59.208 --> 1:15:01.001
What are you looking for now, my nigga?

1:15:01.084 --> 1:15:02.794
Let me Google something real quick.

1:15:05.714 --> 1:15:07.633
What this nigga got going on?

1:15:07.716 --> 1:15:10.761
Alright, we cool, we cool,
there's a theater room on 46th St.

1:15:10.844 --> 1:15:13.889
-We straight--
-Yo, what the fuck you talking about?

1:15:13.972 --> 1:15:15.641
You want to go see a movie now?

1:15:16.642 --> 1:15:17.726
Dumbass.

1:15:22.439 --> 1:15:23.398
You ready?

1:15:28.111 --> 1:15:30.197
-Everybody, get the fuck down!

1:15:30.280 --> 1:15:32.950
-Alright, get down!
-Get the fucking cuffs!

1:15:33.033 --> 1:15:34.535
-Line them up!
-Bitch!

1:15:34.618 --> 1:15:35.661
Line them up!

1:15:36.620 --> 1:15:38.163
Shut the fuck up, bitch.

1:15:38.247 --> 1:15:39.748
Please, no!

1:15:39.831 --> 1:15:41.875
Shut the fuck up
or I will blow your head off.

1:15:42.918 --> 1:15:44.378
-I got these niggas.
-Come on.

1:15:44.461 --> 1:15:45.754
-Get up.
-Shut the fuck up.

1:15:48.465 --> 1:15:49.675
Open the fucking safe!

1:15:50.634 --> 1:15:51.969
Here, fill it up.

1:15:52.761 --> 1:15:55.222
Hurry up, and give me
the fucking tape too.

1:15:56.849 --> 1:15:58.183
-Fuck up.
-Shut the fuck up.

1:16:00.102 --> 1:16:00.936
Fill this.

1:16:15.033 --> 1:16:16.827
Is there anything else you can think of?

1:16:16.910 --> 1:16:18.412
It all happened so fast.

1:16:19.496 --> 1:16:22.249
-Any tattoos, any scars?
-They were wearing masks.

1:16:24.293 --> 1:16:28.088
Uh, can we take a look around,
maybe something else we can use.

1:16:39.308 --> 1:16:42.519
Look at all this fucking money,
nigga. I'm popping bottles.

1:16:42.603 --> 1:16:45.105
I'm buying a bar round.
I'm doing whatever, nigga.

1:16:45.189 --> 1:16:46.440
-Whoo! Cannot wait.
-Yo.

1:16:46.523 --> 1:16:48.233
Don't go-- don't go running around

1:16:48.317 --> 1:16:49.776
blowing money fast, man.

1:16:49.860 --> 1:16:50.986
People are going to ask questions.

1:16:51.069 --> 1:16:52.446
Man, fuck all that, nigga!

1:16:52.529 --> 1:16:53.864
I'm gonna fucking blow this money,

1:16:53.947 --> 1:16:56.700
catch another jux
and blow that shit too, nigga.

1:16:56.783 --> 1:17:00.037
That's my word, I am nigga. You don't see
all this fucking money we just got?

1:17:00.120 --> 1:17:01.663
You ain't hearing me, though.

1:17:01.747 --> 1:17:04.249
Hell no, I'm not hearing you, nigga.

1:17:04.333 --> 1:17:05.876
Nigga, I'm hearing this.

1:17:05.959 --> 1:17:09.046
Chicken, nigga.
This is what I'm hearing, nigga.

1:17:16.136 --> 1:17:19.264
So fucking hype right now,
my nigga, just caught that jux.

1:17:20.224 --> 1:17:23.185
Shit, I can't wait to spend this chicken,
my nigga, how much chicken we got?

1:17:23.268 --> 1:17:26.730
Yo, for the last time, you're not going
to be spending that bread like that.

1:17:26.813 --> 1:17:29.900
I'm definitely spending this chicken,
wait till that bitch see me in the club.

1:17:29.983 --> 1:17:31.860
Nigga, start acting
like you had paper before.

1:17:31.944 --> 1:17:33.654
My nigga, I'm-- I'mma get more paper,

1:17:33.737 --> 1:17:35.739
I'm a spend this chicken,
I'm a get the biggest bottle...

1:17:35.822 --> 1:17:38.492
-Nah, nigga--
-Can't wait till I get to the club, fuck.

1:17:42.871 --> 1:17:44.581
-Shit!
-Yo, what happened?

1:17:44.665 --> 1:17:46.792
Yo, I left my phone in the cupholder,
can you get that for me?

1:17:46.875 --> 1:17:49.336
-Goddamn, nigga. Shit.
-Fuck.

1:17:58.512 --> 1:18:00.347
-Yo, I got the--

1:18:06.228 --> 1:18:07.646
You talk too much.

1:18:17.823 --> 1:18:20.868
-Yo, how we looking?
-Good money, good money.

1:18:22.494 --> 1:18:24.288
That's what I'm talking about, nigga.

1:18:25.706 --> 1:18:27.249
-Who the fuck is that?
-Hold on.

1:18:30.669 --> 1:18:31.628
Yo.

1:18:33.881 --> 1:18:36.258
Oh, shit. It's Cat.

1:18:36.341 --> 1:18:37.551
-What up, nigga?
-What's going on?

1:18:37.634 --> 1:18:39.303
-Oh, shit!
-How do you do?

1:18:39.386 --> 1:18:40.429
What's going on?

1:18:40.929 --> 1:18:42.890
Yo... How did you find me?

1:18:42.973 --> 1:18:45.142
Simple, man, you at
you're at your mother house.

1:18:45.225 --> 1:18:46.977
-True, come in, nigga.
-Word.

1:18:47.060 --> 1:18:48.645
-What's going on?
-Welcome back, B.

1:18:48.729 --> 1:18:50.772
-Yo, yo.
-What's up with you?

1:18:50.856 --> 1:18:53.859
Let me tell you, boy, I didn't think
I was going to see you again.

1:18:53.942 --> 1:18:56.069
Yeah, I was going to run, but they…

1:18:56.153 --> 1:18:57.821
-They locked up my mother.
-What?

1:18:57.905 --> 1:18:59.990
They said because her visa expired.

1:19:00.073 --> 1:19:01.867
But it's because they
want me to turn in myself.

1:19:01.950 --> 1:19:03.243
So what are you going to do?

1:19:03.327 --> 1:19:05.287
I don't know yet, but...

1:19:05.370 --> 1:19:08.290
I have to find a lawyer.
If he can't help then…

1:19:08.373 --> 1:19:09.875
I'm going to have to make a decision.

1:19:09.958 --> 1:19:11.585
Well, you better figure it out fast.

1:19:11.668 --> 1:19:13.504
Or get up enough money to skip town.

1:19:14.338 --> 1:19:15.923
Bloodclaat.

1:19:16.757 --> 1:19:18.467
Yo, I have a few jux lined up.

1:19:19.218 --> 1:19:21.303
Well, nigga, let's do it, I'm ready.

1:19:21.386 --> 1:19:23.680
-What about you?

1:19:23.764 --> 1:19:24.973
-Been ready.
-Alright.

1:19:25.057 --> 1:19:26.391
I tried to find Bandit and Cloud,

1:19:26.475 --> 1:19:27.935
but can't find them.

1:19:28.018 --> 1:19:29.603
-What?
-Anyway.

1:19:29.686 --> 1:19:32.314
We have to run now. The jux are lined up.

1:19:32.397 --> 1:19:33.440
So let's do it.

1:19:34.274 --> 1:19:36.109
-You ready? Alright.
-Yeah.

1:20:36.170 --> 1:20:37.671
Alright, babe, alright.

1:20:40.757 --> 1:20:42.968
Daddy, where you going?
I want more of you.

1:20:43.051 --> 1:20:44.595
I need you to shut up.

1:20:44.678 --> 1:20:47.139
Oh, but I just want
you to come back over here.

1:20:47.222 --> 1:20:49.850
I said I need you to shut the fuck up!

1:20:50.684 --> 1:20:53.520
Here, look, drink me out of
my fucking house now I'm mad.

1:20:53.604 --> 1:20:56.356
Come on. Let's go.
Start working with each other.

1:20:56.440 --> 1:20:59.610
-That's fine for us. Your loss.

1:21:00.652 --> 1:21:01.486
Mm.

1:21:04.573 --> 1:21:06.241
I'll get more champagne!

1:21:11.705 --> 1:21:14.458
Yo. Check that window up there.

1:21:29.973 --> 1:21:31.099
Oh.

1:21:36.522 --> 1:21:38.023
Motherfucker almost killed me.

1:21:38.106 --> 1:21:40.275
-He going to pay for that, watch.
-ASAP!

1:21:41.235 --> 1:21:43.362
-We're going to deal with him tomorrow.
-What?

1:21:43.445 --> 1:21:44.905
-I hope so!
-After what just happened,

1:21:44.988 --> 1:21:46.114
you think we're going
to have another chance?

1:21:46.198 --> 1:21:47.282
I have a plan, man.

1:21:49.368 --> 1:21:50.452
I hope it's a good one.

1:21:51.119 --> 1:21:54.289
I just have to see if Gamble
has the information we'll need.

1:21:55.415 --> 1:21:57.376
Nigga almost blew my fucking head off.

1:21:58.710 --> 1:22:01.338
We got to be careful.
Don't worry about it, we take care of it.

1:22:02.172 --> 1:22:03.382
I'm with you.

1:22:07.010 --> 1:22:07.970
Yo.

1:22:08.720 --> 1:22:11.557
You did bust your ass, though.

1:22:11.640 --> 1:22:13.642
-Shit ain't funny.
-Yes, it was.

1:22:13.725 --> 1:22:15.102
My fucking back hurting and shit.

1:22:15.185 --> 1:22:17.312
Don't worry about it, man,
he's going to feel.

1:22:17.396 --> 1:22:18.522
Trust me.

1:22:40.085 --> 1:22:41.879
What you have me into? Like--

1:22:41.962 --> 1:22:43.422
-What is this?
-Are you serious--

1:22:43.505 --> 1:22:46.550
Hey! Hey! Hey, listen up.
You want to get paid?

1:22:46.633 --> 1:22:48.760
-Get naked and do this fucking right.
-Come on!

1:22:53.432 --> 1:22:55.350
I said don't move, shut up.

1:22:56.768 --> 1:22:58.103
Shut up, faggot!

1:23:03.692 --> 1:23:04.985
Please don't shoot!

1:23:09.615 --> 1:23:14.036
You're a bloodclaat. You are the reason
why Buju went to jail. Bloodclaat.

1:23:14.786 --> 1:23:16.955
-Fuck!
-Shut the fuck up.

1:23:17.039 --> 1:23:18.916
One more word, say another word

1:23:18.999 --> 1:23:20.209
and I'll put one
in your fucking head, you hear?

1:23:20.292 --> 1:23:21.502
I don't even know who the fuck you are.

1:23:21.585 --> 1:23:22.419
What do you want?

1:23:26.131 --> 1:23:28.175
Tell me which part
of your house your money is.

1:23:28.258 --> 1:23:29.718
And don't bloodclaat lie.

1:23:29.801 --> 1:23:32.179
Money, I don't keep
any kind of money here,

1:23:32.262 --> 1:23:33.430
it's all in the bank.

1:23:33.514 --> 1:23:35.349
-Smash a toe.
-Got you.

1:23:37.559 --> 1:23:40.521
-Shut the fuck up!
-Oh, fuck. You cocksucker!

1:23:40.604 --> 1:23:42.731
-Ah, fuck.
-Smash their fucking skulls up in here.

1:23:42.814 --> 1:23:44.483
-Smash another toe.

1:23:44.566 --> 1:23:47.277
Ah, you cocksucker. You motherfucker!

1:23:47.361 --> 1:23:49.696
-You ready to talk?
-I'm going to fucking kill you!

1:23:49.780 --> 1:23:51.365
-Smash another toe.

1:23:51.448 --> 1:23:54.910
Alright, I'll talk.
I'll talk... I'll talk.

1:23:54.993 --> 1:23:56.161
Where is the money?

1:23:56.245 --> 1:23:58.247
Alright, it's behind the fireplace.

1:23:58.330 --> 1:23:59.957
No more, please no more.

1:24:00.040 --> 1:24:00.874
Alright.

1:24:02.584 --> 1:24:04.503
Detective Paul Staly speaking.

1:24:04.586 --> 1:24:06.630
Good afternoon, this is Detective Russo

1:24:06.713 --> 1:24:08.006
over at Suffolk County.

1:24:08.090 --> 1:24:09.424
How may I help you, detective?

1:24:10.384 --> 1:24:12.135
Well, we were investigating a robbery

1:24:12.219 --> 1:24:14.096
and caught one of the perps on camera.

1:24:14.179 --> 1:24:17.182
Paulo Acosta, he goes
by the street name Gamble.

1:24:17.266 --> 1:24:19.685
He may be connected
to the crew you're looking for.

1:24:19.768 --> 1:24:20.894
Okay, thank you.

1:24:26.483 --> 1:24:28.527
Carol. Carol.

1:24:29.653 --> 1:24:31.113
Carol. Shh!

1:24:31.196 --> 1:24:33.490
-What the hell?
-It's me, me, Bandit, Bandit.

1:24:33.574 --> 1:24:34.783
-Yo, just go easy.
-Bandit?

1:24:34.867 --> 1:24:36.285
-Shh.
-What're you doing, man?

1:24:36.368 --> 1:24:37.995
Easy, man. Listen to what I have to say.

1:24:38.078 --> 1:24:41.915
I have something important and I need you
to tell Cat as soon as possible.

1:24:41.999 --> 1:24:43.792
-Oh, God, what's happening?
-Listen.

1:24:43.876 --> 1:24:45.711
I want you to tell him the boy Cloud...

1:24:47.004 --> 1:24:48.630
...is a cop.

1:24:48.714 --> 1:24:50.048
Police boy.

1:24:54.428 --> 1:24:57.431
Well. So far it seems all the
victims knows one another,

1:24:57.514 --> 1:24:59.308
and party together on the weekends.

1:24:59.391 --> 1:25:00.684
I think the party is

1:25:00.767 --> 1:25:02.477
where they must be picking their victims.

1:25:02.561 --> 1:25:04.980
-Then let's start there.
-Exactly.

1:25:05.063 --> 1:25:07.232
And here's our party host, guys.

1:25:07.316 --> 1:25:08.859
Now, this guy is a character.

1:25:10.027 --> 1:25:11.361
Did some time for arson.

1:25:11.445 --> 1:25:13.530
Now he likes to build clubs.

1:25:13.614 --> 1:25:15.240
But he also likes to burn them down

1:25:15.324 --> 1:25:16.825
and collect that insurance money.

1:25:16.909 --> 1:25:18.702
I guess we have a party to go to.

1:25:18.785 --> 1:25:21.872
-Alright, detectives. See you later.
-Talk to you later.

1:25:24.166 --> 1:25:25.334
It's 560.

1:25:25.417 --> 1:25:26.919
-Come on.
-Yeah.

1:25:28.962 --> 1:25:29.963
Yo, smell that.

1:25:30.589 --> 1:25:31.882
Yo, banging.

1:25:32.424 --> 1:25:34.426
-Yo, sis.
-Strawberry flavor.

1:25:35.177 --> 1:25:36.303
Bandit?

1:25:39.264 --> 1:25:40.265
What?

1:25:44.645 --> 1:25:45.646
Police.

1:25:48.982 --> 1:25:50.359
You sure he told you that?

1:25:51.735 --> 1:25:52.694
Thanks, sis.

1:25:53.529 --> 1:25:54.446
Yo.

1:25:55.781 --> 1:25:56.823
Cloud is a cop.

1:25:57.866 --> 1:25:58.784
What?

1:25:59.493 --> 1:26:00.702
Get the fuck outta of here.

1:26:01.537 --> 1:26:02.996
That's crazy.

1:26:03.080 --> 1:26:04.039
Fuck!

1:26:05.624 --> 1:26:07.626
Yo, we have to be done
with this and move right away.

1:26:16.134 --> 1:26:18.053
-Yeah.

1:26:20.305 --> 1:26:21.431
Is that the ballistic report?

1:26:22.724 --> 1:26:23.684
Yeah.

1:26:24.726 --> 1:26:25.561
What?

1:26:27.396 --> 1:26:28.605
Why you shaking your head?

1:26:29.815 --> 1:26:31.024
You're not going to like it.

1:26:32.401 --> 1:26:33.694
Let me see that.

1:26:46.206 --> 1:26:48.083
Where is he?

1:26:49.418 --> 1:26:50.794
He is supposed to come in tonight.

1:26:52.212 --> 1:26:53.130
Fuck!

1:27:02.014 --> 1:27:03.557
-Pussy.

1:27:13.442 --> 1:27:15.360
Dirty police boy. Get up.

1:27:15.444 --> 1:27:17.070
Get up, pussy!

1:27:17.154 --> 1:27:20.073
-Bumbaclaat.
-I don't think so.

1:27:20.157 --> 1:27:21.325
That's gotta hurt.

1:27:23.911 --> 1:27:25.495
You thought I was going to take you in?

1:27:27.039 --> 1:27:29.041
After you made me commit fucking murder!

1:27:31.585 --> 1:27:34.880
-I'm killing you, I'm killing Cat.

1:27:34.963 --> 1:27:36.590
Every motherfucking body.

1:27:37.341 --> 1:27:39.801
Oh, this feels good. Huh?

1:27:39.885 --> 1:27:41.970
-Fuck you.
-Fuck me?

1:27:42.054 --> 1:27:43.847
No, fuck you!

1:27:46.475 --> 1:27:49.186
What do you think the front pages

1:27:49.269 --> 1:27:51.897
of the newspaper is
going to say tomorrow? Huh?

1:27:52.648 --> 1:27:53.774
I'm thinking...

1:27:55.692 --> 1:27:56.818
"Super Cop

1:27:57.444 --> 1:27:59.112
killed home invader."

1:27:59.196 --> 1:28:00.030
I'll tell you what...

1:28:01.114 --> 1:28:04.201
...give Ozzie... my best.

1:28:04.284 --> 1:28:05.953
-Freeze!
-Freeze!

1:28:06.703 --> 1:28:08.914
This motherfucker broke in my house.

1:28:08.997 --> 1:28:10.666
Don't even think about it, Paul.

1:28:16.839 --> 1:28:19.174
It's alright, Paul, just procedure.

1:28:19.258 --> 1:28:21.468
-Alright, what the fuck you doing?
-Calm down.

1:28:22.302 --> 1:28:24.638
Okay.

1:28:32.104 --> 1:28:33.647
-Hey!

1:28:36.066 --> 1:28:39.444
Goddamn psycho. Would somebody
get these cuffs off me, please?

1:28:39.528 --> 1:28:40.821
No, they stay on, Paul.

1:28:42.281 --> 1:28:44.575
-Why, what's going on?
-You're under arrest for murder.

1:28:44.658 --> 1:28:46.034
What are you talking about?

1:28:46.118 --> 1:28:47.953
Someone mailed a gun to the DA's office

1:28:48.036 --> 1:28:49.496
that was involved in a murder-robbery.

1:28:49.580 --> 1:28:52.165
-So what?
-Had your prints on it.

1:28:52.249 --> 1:28:54.626
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, let me explain.

1:28:54.710 --> 1:28:57.254
He set me up.
They set me up. He set me up!

1:28:57.337 --> 1:28:58.881
Somebody get these cuffs off me!

1:29:00.299 --> 1:29:02.759
You should get a lawyer, Paul.

1:29:02.843 --> 1:29:04.595
What you talking about, "Get a lawyer"?

1:29:04.678 --> 1:29:06.221
I didn't fucking kill nobody!

1:29:14.146 --> 1:29:16.106
I need to talk to Mr. Rosenberg.

1:29:19.568 --> 1:29:20.986
My name is Nigel Malone,

1:29:21.069 --> 1:29:24.114
and I am calling in reference
to my mother's immigration issues.

1:29:27.993 --> 1:29:31.038
Mr. Rosenberg, this is Cat.

1:29:31.121 --> 1:29:32.664
Gamble told me to call you.

1:29:32.748 --> 1:29:34.625
He said you can help me with my mother.

1:30:01.109 --> 1:30:03.070
Ah, there he goes. That's my man.

1:30:03.153 --> 1:30:06.156
-Dino, how's everything?
-Hey, Gamble baby, how do you do?

1:30:07.199 --> 1:30:08.784
Aww, man, thank you, brother.

1:30:08.867 --> 1:30:09.993
Alright, alright.

1:30:10.536 --> 1:30:12.162
-Mm.
-Hey, listen.

1:30:12.246 --> 1:30:13.956
Honor to have you present in my home, man.

1:30:14.039 --> 1:30:15.749
Well, you the man of the hour, brother.

1:30:15.832 --> 1:30:18.001
-How's dad, how's the family?
-Everybody's good, listen, man.

1:30:18.085 --> 1:30:19.378
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

1:30:19.461 --> 1:30:20.879
My father could really
use someone like you

1:30:20.963 --> 1:30:21.964
in his business, man.

1:30:22.673 --> 1:30:25.259
I don't really have-- I don't
have that Gamble swag, man.

1:30:25.342 --> 1:30:26.677
-Really?
-What do you think?

1:30:26.760 --> 1:30:28.595
-Let's talk about it.
-You wanna talk about it?

1:30:28.679 --> 1:30:29.888
-Let's talk about it.
-Alright.

1:30:30.472 --> 1:30:32.182
-Mm.
-Come this way.

1:30:34.101 --> 1:30:36.645
You babysitting it though, man.
Go on finish that drink, man.

1:30:36.728 --> 1:30:39.189
-You want me to finish this shit, man?
-Take it back, huh?

1:30:39.273 --> 1:30:41.483
There you go, let me
get you something else, right?

1:30:41.567 --> 1:30:43.735
Hold on right there. Hold on right there.

1:30:43.819 --> 1:30:46.029
Whoa, easy now, I got you.

1:30:46.113 --> 1:30:48.615
-Come on, let me take you in the back.
-In the back?

1:30:48.699 --> 1:30:50.200
Take you in the back.

1:30:56.957 --> 1:31:00.002
Officers, what is so important
that you have to bother me at home?

1:31:00.085 --> 1:31:02.212
-Good evening, Judge.
-Judge, we have a warrant

1:31:02.296 --> 1:31:03.881
that urgently needs your signature.

1:31:06.466 --> 1:31:08.677
So you have enough evidence
to support a warrant?

1:31:08.760 --> 1:31:09.678
Yes, sir.

1:31:10.846 --> 1:31:12.723
I'm curious, who's at this party?

1:31:12.806 --> 1:31:14.683
We're investigating a robbery gang

1:31:14.766 --> 1:31:16.518
that's been targeting
high-profile citizens.

1:31:16.602 --> 1:31:18.145
Now we have reason to believe
that they're choosing

1:31:18.228 --> 1:31:19.980
their victims at this party.

1:31:20.063 --> 1:31:22.774
So, you want to raid the party?

1:31:22.858 --> 1:31:25.444
Yes, sir. And hopefully,
capture the suspects.

1:31:25.527 --> 1:31:27.070
And what if you find nothing?

1:31:27.779 --> 1:31:29.281
I have a hunch we will.

1:31:29.364 --> 1:31:31.408
We've been working this case
for a while now, Judge.

1:31:31.491 --> 1:31:34.203
Now, you know I can't issue
a warrant on a hunch.

1:31:34.286 --> 1:31:35.537
Come on, Judge.

1:31:35.621 --> 1:31:36.997
If this thing doesn't go right,

1:31:37.080 --> 1:31:38.332
and a lawsuit drops,

1:31:38.415 --> 1:31:40.000
I'm the one that's in the fire

1:31:40.083 --> 1:31:42.544
as the judge that issued this warrant.

1:31:42.628 --> 1:31:44.880
And I can't afford the heat,
it's an election year.

1:31:44.963 --> 1:31:47.549
Sir, I don't think
things will go that far.

1:31:48.550 --> 1:31:50.677
I don't think I will be able
to help you out on this one.

1:31:51.261 --> 1:31:54.431
-Judge, please.
-Goodnight, gentlemen, goodnight.

1:31:57.601 --> 1:31:58.560
Goodnight.

1:31:59.311 --> 1:32:02.231
-Oh, yeah.
-I feel dizzy, Gamble.

1:32:04.525 --> 1:32:06.401
-I want to go outside.
-Hold on, bitch.

1:32:11.323 --> 1:32:12.491
Oh, fuck!

1:32:14.618 --> 1:32:15.661
Fuck!

1:32:19.831 --> 1:32:22.292
Damn, bitch, you heavy. Oh, fuck.

1:32:26.296 --> 1:32:27.673
Wake the fuck up!

1:32:28.257 --> 1:32:29.800
Wake the fuck up!

1:32:29.883 --> 1:32:31.301
Wake up, bitch!

1:32:33.679 --> 1:32:35.389
-Alright.
-What the fuck is wrong with y'all?

1:32:35.472 --> 1:32:37.891
Now that
I have everybody's attention.

1:32:39.309 --> 1:32:41.395
Except for this man here.

1:32:42.396 --> 1:32:44.314
Let me start by saying.

1:32:45.190 --> 1:32:46.483
If you want to live,

1:32:47.317 --> 1:32:49.903
you listen and do exactly
what I tell you to do.

1:32:49.987 --> 1:32:52.281
If you don't want to listen,

1:32:52.364 --> 1:32:53.907
shake your head now.

1:32:56.410 --> 1:32:59.121
Everybody. Give me your key.

1:32:59.204 --> 1:33:01.999
Security code. And tell me exactly

1:33:02.082 --> 1:33:05.961
which part of your house where
your money or your jewelry is.

1:33:06.044 --> 1:33:09.214
If the information
you give me is right, you live.

1:33:09.298 --> 1:33:12.134
If it's wrong, you're all going to die.

1:33:12.801 --> 1:33:14.636
Before we go into your house.

1:33:14.720 --> 1:33:17.598
We're gonna call our friend
who is here keeping you company.

1:33:18.265 --> 1:33:22.144
And we going to stay on the
phone until we left your house.

1:33:24.062 --> 1:33:25.856
Anything goes wrong.

1:33:27.274 --> 1:33:28.775
Everybody dead.

1:33:57.804 --> 1:33:59.681
I have a suspect in sight.

1:33:59.765 --> 1:34:01.642
Entering a grey Honda.

1:34:01.725 --> 1:34:04.478
Plate number RKZ-552.

1:34:04.561 --> 1:34:06.563
Tail him, we'll follow you.

1:34:26.959 --> 1:34:28.752
-Who the fuck is that?

1:34:28.836 --> 1:34:30.003
Hold on, hold on. Hold on.

1:34:33.799 --> 1:34:34.675
Gamble.

1:34:39.221 --> 1:34:41.014
-What's up, Slime?
-What's up?

1:34:41.098 --> 1:34:42.516
Good fucking work, gentlemen,

1:34:42.599 --> 1:34:44.059
-good fucking work.
-See what I am dealing with.

1:34:44.142 --> 1:34:45.352
I told you, this is no joke business.

1:34:47.396 --> 1:34:48.981
Why not raid the room now?

1:34:49.064 --> 1:34:50.941
What if it's just a pit stop?

1:34:51.024 --> 1:34:52.651
Or what if he is there with a woman?

1:34:53.235 --> 1:34:54.152
No, we'll wait.

1:34:58.448 --> 1:35:02.911
Oh, man. Yo, fellas, this is
a motherfucking come up, man.

1:35:02.995 --> 1:35:06.164
-This is a lot of motherfucking cash.
-You already know.

1:35:06.248 --> 1:35:08.584
-Huh!
-Yo, let's go, got to get up out of here.

1:35:09.334 --> 1:35:10.836
Alright, hold on,
I'm about to take a piss.

1:35:10.919 --> 1:35:13.088
-Yo, hurry up, my youth.
-Alright, alright.

1:35:24.641 --> 1:35:26.560
-Freeze!

1:35:41.617 --> 1:35:42.826
Oh, shit.

1:36:26.495 --> 1:36:27.454
Go, go, go!

1:36:30.040 --> 1:36:31.166
Oh, shit.

1:37:20.966 --> 1:37:22.467
Shit, fuck.

1:38:02.007 --> 1:38:02.925
Prince.

1:38:04.218 --> 1:38:05.093
Prince!

1:38:06.094 --> 1:38:09.014
Prince! Prince! Prince, man!

1:38:21.401 --> 1:38:22.361
Fuck!

1:38:42.005 --> 1:38:43.674
I grew up poor.

1:38:43.757 --> 1:38:45.843
And growing up poor means
that I had the same dream

1:38:45.926 --> 1:38:49.972
as every poor man and woman
in the ghettos around the world.

1:38:50.055 --> 1:38:53.517
The dream of getting my family
and myself out of the slums.

1:38:53.600 --> 1:38:55.143
Somehow making it big.

1:38:55.811 --> 1:38:59.606
All I needed was the opportunity
to do it. A chance.

1:38:59.690 --> 1:39:03.151
A shot at doing something good
to free us from this hell hole.

1:39:05.028 --> 1:39:08.115
For me, only the streets
gave me a way of getting out.

1:39:08.198 --> 1:39:09.658
So I chose it.

1:39:09.741 --> 1:39:12.619
And for the most part, it did get me out.

1:39:12.703 --> 1:39:17.332
With that the dream changed
because I am out of the ghetto.

1:39:18.208 --> 1:39:21.420
Now all I want to do
is get out of the streets.

1:39:21.503 --> 1:39:23.338
That’s the dream now.

1:39:23.422 --> 1:39:26.133
Take all that the streets
have given me and run.

1:39:27.342 --> 1:39:29.469
But that’s easier said than done.

1:39:29.553 --> 1:39:32.014
Now I have enemies lurking in the dark.

1:39:32.890 --> 1:39:35.434
There are cops one step behind me.

1:39:36.185 --> 1:39:39.062
And there’s a life sentence
in prison waiting for me.

1:39:40.314 --> 1:39:44.401
All because I took advantage of
the opportunity available to me.

1:40:21.730 --> 1:40:24.441
My chance to get myself out of poverty.

1:40:24.525 --> 1:40:27.778
Accomplish what’s been
preached to me all my life.

1:40:29.321 --> 1:40:30.531
The Dream.

1:40:31.698 --> 1:40:33.742
The American Dream.
