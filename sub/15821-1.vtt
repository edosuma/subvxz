00:44.695 --> 00:46.047
Watch your backs.

00:47.394 --> 00:48.980
Watch your backs !

00:54.275 --> 00:56.400
Hey, guys, please, please.

00:56.445 --> 00:58.979
Hey, come on, guys. You want
to cut us some slack, huh ?

00:58.985 --> 01:00.551
Guys, you're not helping. All right ?

01:00.555 --> 01:02.000
Come on, huh ?

01:02.185 --> 01:04.700
Guys, we're all wearing
the same color, all right ?

01:09.965 --> 01:13.111
Can we get him out of there ?

01:19.215 --> 01:21.234
As soon as we can, I promise.

01:21.465 --> 01:22.480
We'll get him out.

01:22.481 --> 01:23.787
Guys, come on.

01:23.796 --> 01:25.810
You know it's time to get him out.

01:26.076 --> 01:28.058
Chief says, that's it.

02:03.876 --> 02:05.280
Thank you, Lieutenant Provenza.

02:05.287 --> 02:06.962
- Thank you very much.
- Chief Johnson.

02:06.977 --> 02:08.643
Commander. Where's chief pope ?

02:08.657 --> 02:10.633
He had an appointment with
an attorney this morning.

02:10.646 --> 02:12.852
I'm not even sure he knows
we have an officer down.

02:12.866 --> 02:14.520
But I spoke to the captain of central.

02:14.536 --> 02:16.321
Well, I'd like to speak
to the captain as well,

02:16.345 --> 02:19.020
but I don't need his entire
division here on the street.

02:19.217 --> 02:21.442
One of their own is lying
dead in that warehouse.

02:21.487 --> 02:22.523
One of our own.

02:22.528 --> 02:24.890
Maybe if you let us clear
Detective Martin's remains--

02:24.896 --> 02:26.613
I haven't examined them yet.

02:26.626 --> 02:27.790
I understand that, but

02:27.806 --> 02:30.771
when an LAPD officer
dies in the line of duty,

02:30.825 --> 02:33.563
we never leave him lying next
to the scumbag who killed him.

02:33.575 --> 02:36.042
That's because when an
officer is murdered on the job,

02:36.057 --> 02:37.530
you usually find them within minutes,

02:37.538 --> 02:39.303
not two days after the fact.

02:39.307 --> 02:41.393
Now, I have a lot of questions
about what happened here,

02:41.406 --> 02:43.723
I don't need this crowd
trying to bully me.

02:43.738 --> 02:46.150
They should be encouraged to leave the
scene and go on about their business.

02:46.158 --> 02:47.862
Not meaning to be presumptuous, Ma'am,

02:47.875 --> 02:49.573
but imagine that it's sergeant Gabriel

02:49.578 --> 02:51.131
lying dead in this warehouse.

02:51.148 --> 02:53.760
Would you be out here waiting to
pay tribute to their sacrifice,

02:53.776 --> 02:56.582
or would you be in your office
going about your business ?

03:03.738 --> 03:05.620
I take your point, Commander.

03:06.647 --> 03:09.310
I'll get this out of the
way as quickly as possible.

03:14.198 --> 03:15.721
Look, we're all on the same side.

03:15.725 --> 03:17.191
Let them do their job.

03:17.205 --> 03:19.212
Let them do their job !

03:30.328 --> 03:32.091
She might get mad at me
for telling you this, but

03:32.097 --> 03:34.230
- Daniels probably shouldn't be here.
- Why ?

03:34.878 --> 03:36.252
When we both worked at central,

03:36.367 --> 03:37.942
she dated Martin for a few months.

03:37.957 --> 03:39.090
I'm only mentioning it'cause

03:39.106 --> 03:40.533
down the road some lawyer
might want to make--

03:40.535 --> 03:41.733
Got it.

03:42.358 --> 03:44.131
So, who's the other dead guy ?

03:44.167 --> 03:46.160
The suspect Detective Martin killed ?

03:46.187 --> 03:47.452
Zeev Barak.

03:47.515 --> 03:49.283
Part of a drug distribution ring.

03:49.298 --> 03:50.190
Ecstasy.

03:50.205 --> 03:51.393
About six months ago,

03:51.408 --> 03:53.471
he caught a couple
of his teenage dealers

03:53.477 --> 03:56.022
overcharging and pocketing the change.

03:56.067 --> 03:57.463
UCLA sophomores.

03:57.477 --> 03:59.491
He shot them to death
in their apartment.

03:59.695 --> 04:01.373
And we know this because ?

04:01.436 --> 04:04.281
Martin and his partner
worked with an informant.

04:04.365 --> 04:06.622
Captain of central
has his name vaulted.

04:06.856 --> 04:08.442
Still waiting for the murder book, too.

04:08.467 --> 04:10.163
Where was Detective Martin's partner ?

04:10.288 --> 04:12.422
Martin was officially off duty.

04:12.965 --> 04:14.753
So he met this guy here alone ?

04:14.768 --> 04:15.963
Without back-up ?

04:16.875 --> 04:18.312
Where did Detective Martin live ?

04:18.327 --> 04:19.373
Long Beach.

04:20.785 --> 04:21.872
Okay.

04:22.248 --> 04:23.471
How'd they get in ?

04:23.648 --> 04:26.790
Side door was unlocked and we
found a key in Martin's pocket.

04:28.186 --> 04:30.282
All right, then, thank
you, Detective Daniels.

04:30.286 --> 04:31.892
Now if you wouldn't
mind waiting outside--

04:31.897 --> 04:33.763
Actually, if it's all
the same to you, Chief--

04:33.766 --> 04:35.751
I'm sorry, but it isn't
all the same to me.

04:35.915 --> 04:36.702
Thanks.

04:36.717 --> 04:38.331
So if you wouldn't
mind waiting outside,

04:38.338 --> 04:39.872
then you can make sure
that central division

04:39.878 --> 04:42.793
stays a respectful distance,
I'd appreciate it. Thank you.

04:44.025 --> 04:45.263
Lieutenant Tao,

04:46.156 --> 04:47.792
what do we think happened here ?

04:49.508 --> 04:52.272
It looks like they
fired at the same time.

04:59.717 --> 05:01.753
Tim Martin got it between the eyes.

05:01.937 --> 05:03.133
As he fell back,

05:03.156 --> 05:05.462
his weapon discharged at Barak.

05:05.576 --> 05:08.460
Just looking at him, the way he's
lying, I bet his spinal cord is severed.

05:09.945 --> 05:12.370
This drug dealer had awfully good aim.

05:12.728 --> 05:15.041
Detective Martin's lips
seem to be decomposing

05:15.056 --> 05:17.402
at the same rate as mr. Barak's.

05:17.415 --> 05:20.400
And  you're looking at second
instart maggots in his eyes.

05:20.406 --> 05:21.633
Same over here.

05:21.857 --> 05:23.851
Still eating in mass.

05:24.456 --> 05:27.221
Gathered around the wounds
and soft tissue openings.

05:27.266 --> 05:29.902
That's consistent with saying
they both died saturday morning ?

05:30.037 --> 05:31.030
Gabriel ?

05:32.447 --> 05:33.662
Lieutenant Flynn,

05:33.677 --> 05:36.351
when S.I.D. Starts collecting DNA

05:36.368 --> 05:38.932
in here, please walk
the elimination samples

05:38.935 --> 05:40.660
from both of these men through our lab

05:40.675 --> 05:42.140
and have that done tonight.

05:42.155 --> 05:45.130
Detective Sanchez, we'll be working
with central division on this.

05:45.147 --> 05:46.910
They'll be in the murder room as well.

05:46.935 --> 05:48.562
I'd like you to keep an eye on them.

05:48.567 --> 05:49.390
Lieutenant Tao,

05:49.397 --> 05:51.380
I want a ballistics trajectory report

05:51.385 --> 05:53.532
from the morgue asap, please.

05:53.545 --> 05:55.343
Let's see how this gunfight played out.

05:55.825 --> 05:57.430
So, Lieutenant Provenza,

05:57.467 --> 05:59.390
summing up what we know so far.

05:59.417 --> 06:01.252
Alone and on his day off,

06:01.266 --> 06:02.771
Detective Tim Martin

06:02.796 --> 06:05.691
enters an abandoned warehouse
in downtown Los Angeles,

06:05.698 --> 06:07.322
30 miles from his home,

06:07.548 --> 06:08.782
in  Long Beach.

06:08.795 --> 06:10.390
By coincidence, Mr. Barak,

06:10.407 --> 06:13.231
a murder suspect in a double
homicide Martin was working,

06:13.237 --> 06:15.981
happens to enter the same warehouse.

06:16.155 --> 06:18.583
They both draw their weapons and fire

06:18.617 --> 06:20.583
at the exact same time,

06:21.088 --> 06:23.982
fatally wounded, they instantly
drop dead where they stand.

06:26.436 --> 06:28.660
What would you say the chances
are it happened like that ?

06:28.985 --> 06:30.851
Apparently, 100 percent.

06:32.685 --> 06:33.612
Chief,

06:33.626 --> 06:35.270
you should see this.

06:37.338 --> 06:38.630
Lieutenant Provenza,

06:38.647 --> 06:39.842
let's clear this place out

06:39.848 --> 06:42.420
as quickly and honorably as possible.

06:42.425 --> 06:44.190
- Thank you.
- Yes, Ma'am.

06:44.217 --> 06:45.900
Can you blow this out please,

06:45.905 --> 06:47.473
and help us clean up Martin ?

06:47.487 --> 06:49.481
Yeah, the last thing we
need is stuff flying out

06:49.498 --> 06:51.622
from under the sheet
when we carry him out.

06:51.638 --> 06:53.561
Then the people would
really hate our guts.

06:53.675 --> 06:55.011
Relax, Flynn.

06:55.016 --> 06:57.162
People hate your guts already.

07:02.048 --> 07:03.991
Thank you, Officer.

07:08.306 --> 07:09.403
Tic  tac.

07:09.787 --> 07:11.691
Chief Johnson, this is captain Leahy.

07:11.707 --> 07:12.923
Central division,

07:12.925 --> 07:15.383
and Martin's partner
Detective Lawrence Xavier.

07:15.391 --> 07:16.967
- I thought you might like to talk to them.
- Sergeant.

07:16.976 --> 07:18.910
Ma'am. Is there anything
I can do to help ?

07:18.936 --> 07:21.248
Yes, there is. Is this the
picture of the informant

07:21.248 --> 07:23.283
that you and Detective
Martin were working with ?

07:23.508 --> 07:24.151
No.

07:24.166 --> 07:26.121
Does he have anything to
do with the Barak case ?

07:26.135 --> 07:27.993
No, Ma'am. He just owns the warehouse.

07:28.006 --> 07:30.353
Because it says here that
he's wanted for questioning

07:30.367 --> 07:32.853
in connection with the
murder of an LAPD officer.

07:32.865 --> 07:35.643
And if I'm considering the
mood of your division...

07:37.235 --> 07:39.893
circulating this man's photograph
puts his life in danger. So

07:39.908 --> 07:41.691
what I need you to do, Captain,

07:41.707 --> 07:43.360
is to find out who created this flyer,

07:43.537 --> 07:44.602
how many were distributed,

07:44.615 --> 07:46.770
and have every single one
of them returned to me.

07:47.086 --> 07:48.491
Let's go !

07:50.576 --> 07:52.981
And I need you to order
your troops to stand down.

07:53.026 --> 07:55.043
Because while you have
my sympathies, Captain,

07:55.056 --> 07:57.421
a righteous call of an
officer down is my job.

07:57.627 --> 08:00.022
Tim martin is not a job to me, Ma'am.

08:00.036 --> 08:01.570
He was my friend.

08:01.878 --> 08:03.273
Wait a second.

08:22.247 --> 08:23.961
Attention !

09:20.445 --> 09:21.972
You could've told me
about it in person.

09:22.035 --> 09:23.593
In advance.
What--

09:24.015 --> 09:25.582
Yeah. I can't talk about this now.

09:25.976 --> 09:26.622
Becau--

09:27.268 --> 09:28.623
Yeah. Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way,

09:28.627 --> 09:30.541
but we just lost a 15-year
veteran in a shootout,

09:30.547 --> 09:33.011
that's actually more important
than you are at the moment.

09:34.106 --> 09:36.120
Leahy, is it true your people
were circulating 100 flyers

09:36.128 --> 09:37.882
of some guy who was not
connected to the crime ?

09:37.898 --> 09:39.593
I got 98 of them back.

09:39.596 --> 09:41.041
And where's Detective
Martin's partner ?

09:41.058 --> 09:43.551
Detective Xavier is waiting
in Commander Taylor's office

09:43.567 --> 09:45.201
with the murder book
and the informant there.

09:45.236 --> 09:47.831
All right, so unless you'd like to
start collecting your pension tomorrow,

09:47.936 --> 09:50.740
central had better back off and
allow Priority Homicide to do its job.

09:50.747 --> 09:51.930
- You're dismissed.
- Sir.

09:52.517 --> 09:54.061
Captain, I'm so sorry,

09:54.066 --> 09:55.031
but I'm afraid

09:55.046 --> 09:57.171
we're really gonna
need all these flyers.

09:57.195 --> 09:59.033
- Because otherwise...
- That's good enough for me.

09:59.047 --> 10:01.291
98 percent's fine. Go on, Captain.

10:03.648 --> 10:06.170
You understand this is not
a picture of the informant

10:06.188 --> 10:07.770
that Detective Martin was working with.

10:08.005 --> 10:10.980
I don't want to talk
about this... anymore.

10:14.088 --> 10:16.803
You left a police officer lying
next to the man who shot him,

10:17.027 --> 10:18.682
and that is never done.

10:19.785 --> 10:22.033
The reason I left
Detective Martin lying there

10:22.046 --> 10:23.621
is that police officers are trained

10:23.637 --> 10:25.271
to fire in bursts,

10:25.285 --> 10:28.161
and Martin only put one
shot into Barak. One.

10:28.398 --> 10:30.982
And the bodies were lying
close together. Too close.

10:31.157 --> 10:33.303
And what was Martin doing
there in the first place ?

10:33.577 --> 10:35.321
Now he and Detective
Xavier were working with

10:35.335 --> 10:37.353
an undercover informant,
and I need to question him.

10:37.365 --> 10:39.951
You can't release the informant's
name to law enforcement.

10:40.095 --> 10:42.121
Well, how I am supposed
to talk to him, Will ?

10:42.245 --> 10:44.660
What if he's not, just,
just waiting by the phone ?

10:44.666 --> 10:46.371
Why is it that you
can never do your job

10:46.387 --> 10:48.832
without constantly
complaining about everything ?

10:49.278 --> 10:51.901
The informant was guaranteed anonymity.

10:59.127 --> 11:01.581
You can release his name to
one other member of your squad,

11:01.616 --> 11:02.750
and that's it. Now,

11:02.776 --> 11:05.513
I've upheld your authority with
the entire department looking on,

11:05.525 --> 11:07.750
but when a police officer
is killed, we expect closure

11:07.778 --> 11:09.990
quickly and completely. Is that clear ?

11:10.097 --> 11:11.391
Yes, it is.

11:15.228 --> 11:17.891
Your attitude, however,
is a complete mystery.

11:36.877 --> 11:37.670
- Chief...
- yes

11:37.685 --> 11:40.241
Lieutenant Tao's put together
a preliminary ballistics report,

11:40.256 --> 11:41.702
and I think before we talk to Xavier,

11:41.708 --> 11:43.570
you should see what he's put together.

11:44.956 --> 11:46.250
How graphic is it ?

11:46.276 --> 11:47.740
No morgue shots.

11:47.755 --> 11:48.821
All right, then.

11:49.445 --> 11:51.370
All right, then, let's
see what we've got.

11:51.685 --> 11:52.661
So...

11:54.326 --> 11:56.391
why isn't this...

12:00.015 --> 12:01.711
oh, first I should say the bullets

12:01.716 --> 12:03.390
we pulled out of those college kids,

12:03.417 --> 12:05.161
the double homicide
Tim Martin was working,

12:05.165 --> 12:07.001
they match Barak's gun.

12:08.528 --> 12:11.243
Lieutenant Provenza, are you
eating chocolate in here ?

12:19.086 --> 12:20.663
Sorry.

12:20.848 --> 12:23.353
I thought we agreed to keep
snacks with processed sugar

12:23.377 --> 12:24.981
out of the murder room.

12:25.198 --> 12:26.732
If  y'all have to have candy,

12:26.748 --> 12:29.221
please do so in the hallways
in the electronics room.

12:29.236 --> 12:31.022
Or you might try giving it up.

12:31.045 --> 12:33.370
Since I stopped eating all
that crap, I have more energy.

12:33.388 --> 12:35.090
And I'm sleeping better, too.

12:35.746 --> 12:37.112
What about nuts ?

12:37.165 --> 12:38.511
Excuse me ?

12:38.658 --> 12:40.453
Are my nuts allowed in here ?

12:40.516 --> 12:42.481
Do they have sugar
on them, lieutenant ?

12:42.756 --> 12:43.592
No.

12:44.237 --> 12:45.161
They're salty.

12:45.988 --> 12:47.783
Well, there's your answer then.

12:48.337 --> 12:50.330
What about the slug in detective...

12:54.786 --> 12:56.690
what about the slug
that was taken out of

12:56.708 --> 12:58.930
Detective Martin's
head, Lieutenant Tao ?

12:58.995 --> 13:00.773
Also from Barak's gun.

13:00.817 --> 13:03.050
And the bullet that killed
Barak was from Martin's weapon.

13:03.067 --> 13:05.022
But then we start to have problems.

13:05.287 --> 13:06.382
It seems like

13:06.416 --> 13:08.810
Martin fired first from about 15 feet.

13:08.875 --> 13:11.440
His bullet grazes the
top of Barak's heart,

13:12.578 --> 13:14.851
shatters the spine,
and Barak falls dead.

13:16.186 --> 13:16.742
So...

13:17.205 --> 13:20.063
Barak falls dead and
his gun discharges ?

13:20.307 --> 13:21.601
No. Couldn't have.

13:22.486 --> 13:23.521
Because Martin

13:23.566 --> 13:25.142
was shot from 4 feet away.

13:25.797 --> 13:27.511
And the entry wound shows

13:27.906 --> 13:30.910
the  bullet was fired
from a crouching position.

13:31.277 --> 13:32.610
Not from the ground.

13:33.278 --> 13:36.172
So even if we supposed Martin
fired and walked towards the body,

13:37.038 --> 13:38.512
Barak would've been paralyzed.

13:38.625 --> 13:40.012
He couldn't have fired at all.

13:40.097 --> 13:42.710
But Barak's gun definitely
killed Detective Martin ?

13:44.256 --> 13:45.202
It did.

13:47.607 --> 13:49.943
There was a third
person in that warehouse.

13:57.765 --> 14:00.203
I'm so sorry this is taking so long.

14:00.267 --> 14:03.103
Detective Xavier, I think
I have the basics now.

14:03.467 --> 14:06.041
So Zeev Barak murdered two young men

14:06.057 --> 14:07.342
who were dealing x for him,

14:07.358 --> 14:09.570
and leaves their apartment,
demanding his cousin,

14:09.596 --> 14:11.112
Ari Cohen,

14:11.135 --> 14:13.073
drive him to the airport.

14:13.127 --> 14:15.572
Ari says he had no idea
Barak intended to kill anyone,

14:15.588 --> 14:18.022
and after the shooting,
he offers his testimony

14:18.035 --> 14:19.943
in exchange for immunity.

14:19.988 --> 14:20.532
But

14:20.578 --> 14:22.772
how do you know that your informant

14:22.965 --> 14:25.210
didn't kill those men
and blame it on Barak ?

14:25.497 --> 14:27.271
The kids fought back. Barak got cut.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.103
We got good DNA samples of the killer

14:29.107 --> 14:30.721
from the apartment where
the boys were murdered.

14:30.756 --> 14:31.842
Nothing matched Ari,

14:31.856 --> 14:33.760
so we paid him $25,000

14:33.775 --> 14:35.081
to fly up to vancouver

14:35.097 --> 14:37.053
and get the routine two
samples off his cousin.

14:37.096 --> 14:38.953
But the DNA samples he brought back

14:38.958 --> 14:40.590
didn't match the guy
who killed the kids ?

14:40.636 --> 14:42.070
They didn't match each other.

14:42.178 --> 14:44.310
Look in section 6 of
your murder book there.

14:44.628 --> 14:45.772
Mr. Informant

14:45.795 --> 14:48.523
submitted DNA from
two different people.

14:49.168 --> 14:50.132
Males.

14:50.395 --> 14:51.532
Relatives.

14:51.636 --> 14:54.003
Didn't hit anything from our
crime scene or our database.

14:54.497 --> 14:57.213
So, looks like Barak's
death is good for Ari,

14:57.357 --> 14:58.663
doesn't have to testify,

14:58.675 --> 15:00.962
his cousin's partner won't
know he's a snitch, and...

15:01.436 --> 15:03.312
he got $25,000.

15:05.778 --> 15:06.820
In cash.

15:07.576 --> 15:10.102
So, he met with the police regularly

15:10.308 --> 15:11.670
at the warehouse ?

15:11.848 --> 15:12.790
Whose idea was that ?

15:12.808 --> 15:13.743
Ari's.

15:14.435 --> 15:16.803
One of his friends wanted to sell
it, so he paid Ari to show it around

15:16.817 --> 15:19.992
- to anybody who wanted to look at it.
- Did you have keys to the side door ?

15:21.768 --> 15:23.380
- No.
- So why do you suppose

15:23.396 --> 15:25.230
Martin went there on his day off ?

15:25.356 --> 15:26.303
I don't know.

15:26.447 --> 15:29.312
Any reason Martin might go to the
warehouse and not want you around ?

15:32.407 --> 15:34.061
Look... here's the thing.

15:34.166 --> 15:35.892
I got on this case late.

15:35.995 --> 15:38.053
Tim had been working with
Detective Hubbard before me.

15:38.067 --> 15:40.120
They'd been partners
since, like the early 90s.

15:40.367 --> 15:42.823
Then Hubbard takes family
leave because his wife died,

15:42.826 --> 15:44.413
and his kid had cancer.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.351
Me and tim, we'd only
been partners two months.

15:47.367 --> 15:49.421
And is it standard procedure for people

15:49.437 --> 15:51.891
from central division to meet
with murder suspects on their own ?

15:51.956 --> 15:53.023
- No.
- On their days off ?

15:53.035 --> 15:54.583
- No.
- If I look at your qualifying test,

15:54.596 --> 15:56.942
who will I find is a
better shot, you or Martin ?

15:56.985 --> 15:58.260
Me. Because Tim had problems...

15:58.266 --> 16:00.442
when Martin didn't show
up for work on monday,

16:00.586 --> 16:02.172
you talked to your
captain about it, why ?

16:02.428 --> 16:03.360
Linda...

16:04.666 --> 16:06.151
his girlfriend,

16:06.196 --> 16:07.570
Martin's girlfriend,

16:07.608 --> 16:09.971
- she called me saturday night...
- you work...

16:10.148 --> 16:11.273
on saturday ?

16:12.756 --> 16:14.583
Are these difficult
questions, Detective,

16:14.606 --> 16:16.732
because I think they're fairly simple.

16:17.227 --> 16:18.933
Were you at work on saturday,

16:18.966 --> 16:20.692
or should I look it up ?

16:21.537 --> 16:22.561
I was home.

16:24.065 --> 16:26.422
Linda called me because
Tim had a date with her,

16:26.438 --> 16:27.520
and he stood her up.

16:28.245 --> 16:29.833
So I tried to get in touch with him.

16:30.296 --> 16:32.630
Left a few messages, and
when he didn't get back to me,

16:32.726 --> 16:34.152
I drove down there sunday morning,

16:34.167 --> 16:36.722
knocked, looked through the flap of
the door and saw his mail from saturday.

16:36.736 --> 16:38.112
And had you been there before ?

16:38.288 --> 16:39.552
To his apartment ?

16:40.777 --> 16:41.452
No.

16:41.908 --> 16:43.590
No, I almost didn't go this time.

16:44.227 --> 16:46.753
See, standing up girlfriends
is Martin's way of usually

16:46.765 --> 16:48.783
letting them know he's
about to wind things down.

16:48.785 --> 16:51.061
And when I say that, I
don't mean he's a bad cop.

16:51.088 --> 16:52.973
Just a jerk when it came to women.

16:54.188 --> 16:56.161
Anyway, when he didn't
show up on monday,

16:56.178 --> 16:57.622
I went to Captain Leahy.

17:02.105 --> 17:04.391
Thank you, detective
xavier. That's all for now.

17:05.805 --> 17:06.451
Ma'am.

17:11.166 --> 17:12.190
By the way,

17:12.808 --> 17:14.833
have you been offered counseling ?

17:16.556 --> 17:18.551
- Excuse me ?
- You seem to be holding back

17:18.575 --> 17:21.502
the natural grief one feels at
losing a partner and fellow officer.

17:21.928 --> 17:23.681
Perhaps you can get
some help with that.

17:33.668 --> 17:35.140
For the time being,

17:35.178 --> 17:37.722
the name Ari Cohen is our
little secret, sergeant.

17:37.807 --> 17:40.222
I'd like you to find him for me. Please

17:40.295 --> 17:42.871
But don't identify
yourself to anyone you call

17:42.918 --> 17:44.422
as a police officer.

17:44.737 --> 17:47.001
I'll be back in about an hour or two.

17:47.346 --> 17:48.653
All right. Okay.

17:56.658 --> 17:58.361
I was gonna stop by Dupars

17:58.366 --> 18:00.443
and  pick up a pie, too, but

18:00.538 --> 18:02.752
but with this diet you're on,

18:02.768 --> 18:05.112
I didn't think you'd
feel comfortable with

18:05.296 --> 18:07.951
- more pastry in the house.
- Oh, I wouldn't.

18:08.578 --> 18:11.131
And it-it's not a diet,
it's a life change.

18:11.706 --> 18:13.610
Either you control
the sugar in your life,

18:13.627 --> 18:15.120
or the sugar controls you.

18:15.205 --> 18:16.481
And it ages you.

18:16.715 --> 18:18.883
I read this book, and I'm just,

18:18.896 --> 18:20.111
I'm over it.

18:20.887 --> 18:21.970
Okay.

18:22.457 --> 18:24.642
I just-I just don't
want sugar anymore.

18:25.596 --> 18:27.402
- I'm just, I'm finished with it.
- OK

18:29.795 --> 18:30.913
I really am.

18:31.705 --> 18:32.731
I believe you.

18:35.645 --> 18:36.521
By the way...

18:36.746 --> 18:40.190
the... escrow on my condo is about up.

18:43.588 --> 18:46.501
I was wondering if you'd thought
over what we talked about.

18:50.117 --> 18:51.470
You know, cause otherwise,

18:52.048 --> 18:53.260
there's a

18:53.347 --> 18:55.400
position in behavioral sciences.

18:55.415 --> 18:57.162
It's been suggested I put in for it.

18:58.337 --> 19:00.052
It would mean me moving back east.

19:02.348 --> 19:04.570
But it would give me a chance to

19:05.367 --> 19:07.783
move up the FBI's food chain.

19:07.795 --> 19:10.880
Fritz, I don't want you to go.

19:12.497 --> 19:14.093
And, of course, I've thought about...

19:15.436 --> 19:16.990
it, I just...

19:17.687 --> 19:19.531
see, moving in together...

19:20.486 --> 19:21.291
I don't...

19:23.167 --> 19:24.083
- there's...
- what ?

19:24.106 --> 19:26.782
There's all these problems that
would have to be worked out.

19:26.857 --> 19:28.553
- Like what ?
- Well, like

19:28.588 --> 19:30.170
getting a new phone, for one thing.

19:30.188 --> 19:32.002
Cause you couldn't answer
mine when my parents call.

19:32.005 --> 19:33.111
That's not really it.

19:33.126 --> 19:36.222
And I, I can be, just impossible.

19:36.336 --> 19:39.333
- Yeah. I like it that you're impossible.
- Well, what if you stopped ?

19:42.398 --> 19:44.732
Stopped liking me ?

19:46.106 --> 19:47.823
If I was gonna stop liking you,

19:48.118 --> 19:49.732
I would've done it already.

19:53.225 --> 19:53.861
But...

19:54.677 --> 19:55.643
well...

19:58.215 --> 20:00.150
look, I haven't had

20:00.246 --> 20:02.782
a lot of success living with guys,

20:03.015 --> 20:03.502
and...

20:04.447 --> 20:06.363
it could just ruin everything.

20:06.398 --> 20:09.271
But, you know, if,

20:11.845 --> 20:13.441
we're trying to sort of

20:13.596 --> 20:15.171
come closer,

20:15.407 --> 20:18.391
you know, more like full partners...

20:20.646 --> 20:23.672
living together would give us a
chance to see what that would be like.

20:41.707 --> 20:42.763
It's work.

20:43.365 --> 20:45.103
I know we're having a serious...

20:45.817 --> 20:47.503
Hello ? What ?

20:48.588 --> 20:49.881
How long ago ?

20:51.078 --> 20:53.612
It's Lieutenant Provenza.
They found our informant.

20:53.626 --> 20:54.922
Though how he knows...

20:56.498 --> 20:58.561
all right. I'll be there
in about 20 minutes.

20:58.678 --> 20:59.752
Okay. Bye.

21:01.587 --> 21:03.021
I love this.

21:03.485 --> 21:05.311
Trying to have lunch together more.

21:05.365 --> 21:06.821
It's nice.

21:07.606 --> 21:10.170
And, uh, we'll talk about this,

21:10.278 --> 21:11.902
all this...

21:12.177 --> 21:14.880
- yeah, sure.
- Later. This evening or something.

21:17.035 --> 21:18.360
This reluctance of yours,

21:18.366 --> 21:20.530
it has nothing to do with
what's going on with Pope,

21:20.735 --> 21:21.571
does it ?

21:24.007 --> 21:25.563
What's going on with pope ?

21:25.638 --> 21:28.001
His wife served him with
divorce papers last friday.

21:28.276 --> 21:29.333
You didn't know ?

21:31.317 --> 21:31.883
No.

21:33.405 --> 21:35.311
What do you do for a living again ?

21:38.178 --> 21:40.740
If you're not going
to talk to him... Sir,

21:40.887 --> 21:42.670
we'd like to take him to central.

21:42.688 --> 21:44.252
Yeah, well, I don't give
a flying you-know-what

21:44.266 --> 21:46.150
where you'd like to take anybody.

21:46.166 --> 21:47.920
- Is that right ?
- Yeah. That's right.

21:47.936 --> 21:49.353
Hey ! Hey !

21:49.365 --> 21:51.301
I'm getting your captain on
the other end of the line here,

21:51.318 --> 21:53.632
so you want to park
your asses somewhere ?

21:58.686 --> 22:01.003
Did I not say to keep
quiet about our guy ?

22:01.645 --> 22:04.453
He's not our guy. He's
the guy from the flyer.

22:04.477 --> 22:06.531
The owner of the
warehouse. Michael deitz.

22:06.717 --> 22:08.041
He's been roughed up, too.

22:08.055 --> 22:10.100
I got Chief Pope down
here as soon as I got back.

22:10.528 --> 22:11.422
Back from where ?

22:11.437 --> 22:13.761
From Ari Cohen's house.

22:13.785 --> 22:14.980
He's not there.

22:14.996 --> 22:16.930
Newspaper is stacked up over the fence.

22:17.686 --> 22:19.922
Neighbor said they haven't
seen him in over two weeks, so,

22:20.215 --> 22:22.482
- I'm gonna have to try to find...
- my fault, I'm sorry.

22:22.768 --> 22:24.390
Thank you, Sergeant Gabriel.

22:25.148 --> 22:27.300
You were right. We should've
pulled in those other flyers.

22:27.337 --> 22:29.543
Never mind, Will. It's fine.

22:30.747 --> 22:32.591
Look, this guy's a friend of ours.

22:32.627 --> 22:34.143
- Maybe he can help me find him.
- No

22:34.167 --> 22:36.341
Dietz cannot know Ari was an informant.

22:36.516 --> 22:38.071
And besides, thanks
to central division,

22:38.087 --> 22:40.383
we may have a civil suit on our hands.

22:40.635 --> 22:43.231
I need to calm him down
in an official kind of way.

22:43.498 --> 22:45.391
I can manage this. You look tired.

22:45.417 --> 22:47.170
Why don't you head on home.

22:49.915 --> 22:52.862
Please don't use the techniques
you employ in there...

22:53.198 --> 22:54.033
on me.

22:55.035 --> 22:57.011
Something you'd like to know, ask me.

22:59.447 --> 23:01.101
I didn't think it was
any of my business.

23:01.118 --> 23:02.003
I just,

23:02.897 --> 23:04.882
I heard you were getting
a divorce. That's all.

23:04.895 --> 23:07.011
I'm not getting a divorce.
Estelle's getting a divorce.

23:08.147 --> 23:10.023
You know, the job, the hours, she's

23:10.268 --> 23:11.723
seeing someone else.

23:11.805 --> 23:13.261
They're getting married.

23:13.297 --> 23:14.433
So no alimony.

23:14.848 --> 23:16.750
She doesn't want our kids,

23:16.758 --> 23:18.733
because he doesn't want them.

23:19.865 --> 23:21.340
So there's that, and you know, well,

23:21.357 --> 23:23.451
at some point, it'll stop
hurting, and I'll just

23:24.305 --> 23:27.031
- hate her and go on with my life.
- Oh, Will. I'm sorry.

23:27.198 --> 23:28.473
I really am.

23:28.478 --> 23:30.160
You know what, let's discuss it later.

23:30.168 --> 23:32.353
We have a murdered
officer to deal with,

23:32.356 --> 23:34.220
and central division is going nuts.

23:34.328 --> 23:35.150
All right.

23:35.168 --> 23:37.011
Now, Will, I'm not complaining,

23:37.026 --> 23:39.493
but ballistics suggests
that there was someone else

23:39.506 --> 23:42.362
in that warehouse when
Martin and Barak were killed,

23:42.578 --> 23:45.411
and I really need to talk to
this informant, Ari. I really do.

23:45.496 --> 23:46.713
Who was martin's partner

23:46.715 --> 23:48.422
- before Xavier ?
- Hubbard.

23:48.428 --> 23:51.032
He's on family leave. His
10-year-old boy's got cancer.

23:51.328 --> 23:53.482
He's at the hospital 24/7.

23:53.498 --> 23:55.010
Well, you know where to find him then.

23:55.586 --> 23:56.891
All right then.

23:59.097 --> 24:00.271
Mr. Dietz.

24:00.686 --> 24:02.022
My name's William Pope.

24:24.057 --> 24:25.923
It's hard to believe Tim's gone.

24:27.827 --> 24:29.511
I should've gone with him.

24:30.085 --> 24:32.391
But my
wife--please.

24:33.206 --> 24:35.283
My wife died 4 years ago,

24:35.828 --> 24:37.492
and... Charlie,

24:37.978 --> 24:39.462
that's my son...

24:40.898 --> 24:42.180
I thought,

24:42.305 --> 24:45.731
charlie deserves to always
have one parent around.

24:46.537 --> 24:49.641
- When you said you thought about...
- So how's your son doing, is he ok ?

24:51.066 --> 24:53.100
You know, bone cancer's tough.

24:54.218 --> 24:56.790
First we tried an experimental therapy,

24:56.927 --> 24:57.682
didn't work.

24:57.697 --> 24:59.891
Now we're looking for a
bone marrow transplant,

24:59.908 --> 25:01.782
but you need an exact match.

25:02.568 --> 25:05.272
Thank God my wife's
parents have a lot of money.

25:06.356 --> 25:07.563
Any luck ?

25:08.148 --> 25:09.993
I tested, and, no.

25:10.005 --> 25:11.183
I struck out,

25:11.187 --> 25:13.603
but, you know, lots of people have

25:13.625 --> 25:15.033
volunteered.

25:15.148 --> 25:16.541
Charlie's got a website.

25:17.668 --> 25:20.081
He has a diary of
everything we're doing here.

25:20.328 --> 25:21.671
People write in, and

25:21.676 --> 25:23.973
the website has a link.

25:24.288 --> 25:26.442
Check it out if you'd
like to. Thank you.

25:26.478 --> 25:28.570
- I will. I will.
- Thank you...

25:28.726 --> 25:31.730
- for that.
- I'm so sorry about your partner.

25:34.486 --> 25:35.550
Yeah.

25:35.678 --> 25:37.931
It's just unbelievable.

25:38.658 --> 25:40.713
I can't think of why.

25:40.885 --> 25:43.303
Why he would go down there alone.

25:43.548 --> 25:45.003
You knew about it then ?

25:45.118 --> 25:45.872
The meet ?

25:45.968 --> 25:47.672
With Ari ? Yeah.

25:47.728 --> 25:49.363
Yeah, I helped set it up.

25:49.566 --> 25:50.853
You called ari ?

25:51.075 --> 25:54.331
After he brought back those screwed
up DNA samples from vancouver.

25:54.345 --> 25:55.322
No way.

25:55.796 --> 25:58.390
No, he called me, uh... last,

25:58.525 --> 25:59.340
wednesday.

25:59.376 --> 26:01.823
Ari says he wants to
meet, and I told him,

26:01.835 --> 26:03.063
call Tim,

26:03.367 --> 26:05.940
which I guess he did,
cause Tim phoned me,

26:06.007 --> 26:09.001
said that Ari was coming back saturday
morning and would I go with him,

26:09.997 --> 26:10.921
cause...

26:11.395 --> 26:13.651
cause I handled Ari better.

26:15.085 --> 26:18.051
Charlie had a transfusion that morning.

26:20.315 --> 26:22.720
Did Ari say anything
about bringing Barak ?

26:24.025 --> 26:24.942
No.

26:25.025 --> 26:27.660
I mean, if we'd known
that Barak was coming,

26:27.998 --> 26:30.092
we would've had surveillance,

26:30.108 --> 26:32.002
we would've brought in sharp shooters,

26:32.028 --> 26:33.673
that's a dangerous man.

26:33.858 --> 26:36.442
Any idea why Tim might not
want Xavier to go with him ?

26:37.327 --> 26:39.783
Well, may... Oh, hey, partner.

26:40.005 --> 26:41.032
Where are you going ?

26:41.047 --> 26:42.291
Ultrasound.

26:42.955 --> 26:45.160
- Don't worry. It's nothing.
- Okay.

26:45.735 --> 26:46.870
Are you working ?

26:46.966 --> 26:48.632
No. I'm just giving some background

26:48.636 --> 26:50.542
to these detectives on an old case.

26:51.298 --> 26:52.483
Keep him busy for me.

26:53.135 --> 26:54.071
I want you to work.

26:54.156 --> 26:56.313
- Please
- Well, maybe I should go with you.

26:56.456 --> 26:57.983
No. You shouldn't.

26:58.346 --> 27:00.072
You're driving me crazy.

27:00.518 --> 27:02.632
- Bye.
- All right. Good bye.

27:03.626 --> 27:06.573
All right, when you get back, I'm
gonna kick your butt in monopoly again.

27:06.608 --> 27:08.560
- You wish.
- I wish ?

27:14.146 --> 27:16.232
He never gets down. Just...

27:16.347 --> 27:18.060
I couldn't do that.

27:20.498 --> 27:22.843
And we were talking about... Tim,

27:22.875 --> 27:25.923
and why we might not want Xavier
to go with him to the warehouse.

27:25.926 --> 27:27.132
And I was just wondering

27:27.147 --> 27:29.061
if it had anything to
do with Tim's girlfriend.

27:30.296 --> 27:31.191
Why ?

27:31.457 --> 27:32.933
Why would you think that ?

27:33.075 --> 27:34.493
Well, she called Xavier at home

27:34.517 --> 27:36.231
to find out why tim stood her up,

27:36.636 --> 27:39.131
and I was wondering how she
had Xavier's home phone number.

27:39.808 --> 27:40.500
Well,

27:41.318 --> 27:42.963
there was some, uh...

27:43.138 --> 27:46.321
overlap there between Xavier and Tim.

27:46.757 --> 27:49.033
You saying Tim moved in
on Xavier's girlfriend

27:49.118 --> 27:50.730
while Xavier was still dating her ?

27:50.775 --> 27:53.762
Maybe she didn't like
Xavier as much as he thought.

27:54.406 --> 27:55.402
That's...

27:55.886 --> 27:58.882
something a guy has to come
to terms with sometimes.

27:59.497 --> 28:00.522
Or not.

28:01.835 --> 28:04.243
I can't believe Martin was
still pulling that crap.

28:04.646 --> 28:05.363
Look...

28:06.267 --> 28:08.023
I don't want to get Xavier in trouble.

28:08.888 --> 28:11.512
Yeah, well, I need to talk to
this girlfriend. And right away.

28:11.698 --> 28:14.210
So, Detective Hubbard,
what's her full name ?

28:16.008 --> 28:17.302
Um, please ?

28:21.495 --> 28:23.401
And to be dragged down here

28:23.438 --> 28:25.860
after everything that has gone on,

28:25.875 --> 28:28.851
and read my rights like I was
some common criminal or something.

28:28.918 --> 28:30.372
Miss Linda Salk.

28:30.387 --> 28:32.250
I'm Deputy Chief Brenda Johnson,

28:32.255 --> 28:35.390
and I am very, very sorry
to have kept you waiting on

28:35.436 --> 28:37.562
<i>what must be a terrible day for you.</i>

28:39.418 --> 28:41.112
<i>It is a terrible day.</i>

28:41.568 --> 28:43.570
This is a surveillance center.

28:43.588 --> 28:44.830
Not a concession stand.

28:45.707 --> 28:47.461
And I'm not your maid, okay ?

28:48.985 --> 28:50.803
Why don't you calm down, buzz.

28:51.615 --> 28:53.723
<i>If you're going to
treat me like a criminal,</i>

28:53.978 --> 28:55.371
shouldn't I have an attorney ?

28:56.766 --> 28:59.452
we'd get into such trouble
if we gave legal advice.

28:59.467 --> 29:01.052
I was trying to get you in and out, but

29:01.088 --> 29:03.090
if having a lawyer would make
you feel more comfortable,

29:03.107 --> 29:05.321
you just call one, and we'll wait.

29:05.848 --> 29:07.613
That's the nice thing about
working for the government,

29:07.618 --> 29:09.302
you get paid for just being here.

29:13.498 --> 29:15.370
That's how you're
treating Tim's death ?

29:15.646 --> 29:18.300
As an overtime opportunity ?

29:18.585 --> 29:20.540
Well, I was going to
ask you some questions.

29:20.556 --> 29:22.132
What do you think I could know ?

29:22.157 --> 29:23.462
I'm not sure, Ma'am.

29:23.478 --> 29:26.241
But there was a third
person in that warehouse.

29:26.626 --> 29:28.963
And we're trying to figure
out who that could've been.

29:29.188 --> 29:31.712
I'm only bringing it up because
you were the first person

29:31.728 --> 29:34.460
to report him missing, and you're
licensed to carry a handgun.

29:34.485 --> 29:36.730
And I carry a handgun

29:36.785 --> 29:38.990
because it is my constitutional right

29:39.155 --> 29:40.181
to do so,

29:40.257 --> 29:41.633
and I have an ex,

29:41.695 --> 29:42.993
who is also a cop

29:43.008 --> 29:45.532
and likes to drive by my
house sometimes at night

29:45.547 --> 29:47.640
and flash his brights in my window.

29:47.657 --> 29:49.210
He even knocked on the door

29:49.245 --> 29:50.930
at Tim's one night. Drunk.

29:51.835 --> 29:54.092
- Are you talking about Lawrence Xavier ?
- I am.

29:55.445 --> 29:57.823
<i>If he intimidated you,
why didn't you report him ?</i>

29:59.265 --> 30:01.400
<i>Because Tim talked me out of it.</i>

30:01.485 --> 30:04.433
He said he'd put a
stop to it, and he did.

30:05.408 --> 30:07.283
And I only got one
more call from Lawrence

30:07.297 --> 30:09.713
complaining about how
much money he had wasted...

30:12.366 --> 30:14.282
on our dates, and so... I sent him

30:14.297 --> 30:16.090
a check for 1,000 dollars.

30:16.155 --> 30:18.173
By messenger. And you know
what, he cashed it, too.

30:19.006 --> 30:20.292
Asshole.

30:20.328 --> 30:21.320
And you know what,

30:22.046 --> 30:25.022
I paid for most of the stuff
that Tim and I did together,

30:25.075 --> 30:27.581
and anyway, you know what, I
don't really care about this stuff.

30:28.516 --> 30:30.303
Detective Martin was
hurting for money ?

30:30.698 --> 30:31.892
He's a cop.

30:31.938 --> 30:32.732
You know ?

30:32.746 --> 30:34.942
He's not made of money, and I pull down

30:34.956 --> 30:36.792
enough for both of us.

30:36.835 --> 30:39.033
I'm a top salesperson

30:39.598 --> 30:42.020
for suburbans in the
Southland, 3 years going.

30:42.058 --> 30:43.303
Excuse me.

30:44.068 --> 30:46.843
Did Detective Martin
ever mention his job ?

30:47.447 --> 30:48.993
The Barak case ?

30:49.135 --> 30:51.901
Because he and Detective
Xavier were working it together.

30:53.175 --> 30:55.372
Did he say he was meeting
someone saturday morning ?

30:56.396 --> 30:57.600
Did he mention a name ?

31:01.156 --> 31:01.970
Yeah.

31:02.558 --> 31:04.593
There was an informant that...

31:05.078 --> 31:07.192
I wasn't supposed to know about Ari.

31:07.205 --> 31:08.791
Ari Cohen ?

31:08.858 --> 31:10.091
<i>Maybe.</i>

31:10.105 --> 31:11.790
<i>It was a jewish name.</i>

31:11.947 --> 31:13.802
And this Ari guy had gone to Vegas

31:13.818 --> 31:15.910
and Tim thought that
he was coming back.

31:20.055 --> 31:22.501
No one in here heard that name.

31:23.557 --> 31:24.801
Damn.

31:36.635 --> 31:38.261
And I broke it off with him.

31:40.955 --> 31:43.201
That's really all I had to say.

31:44.185 --> 31:46.691
Well, thank you, Detective Daniels, for

31:47.395 --> 31:49.501
sharing that information with me.

32:00.967 --> 32:03.453
I asked lieutenant Tao to
drag Ari's credit cards,

32:03.456 --> 32:06.290
and we found out where
he's staying in Vegas.

32:06.305 --> 32:08.362
He's racked up some pretty
good cash advances, too,

32:08.366 --> 32:09.092
but

32:09.816 --> 32:12.110
we don't have any authority in Nevada.

32:14.688 --> 32:16.840
Yeah. I think that we can

32:17.056 --> 32:19.450
talk him into a quick trip home.

32:20.665 --> 32:22.631
So, Sergeant, tell me,

32:23.077 --> 32:26.073
how did you know that Detective
Martin had a thing about

32:26.566 --> 32:28.500
women who were seeing other guys ?

32:32.895 --> 32:34.051
No answer ?

32:34.598 --> 32:35.680
Because...

32:36.007 --> 32:38.020
you were awfully quick
about that info about

32:38.046 --> 32:39.620
Daniels having dated him.

32:39.787 --> 32:42.061
And you were at central,
too. At the same time.

32:42.368 --> 32:44.772
Could it be that you
experienced some overlap

32:44.817 --> 32:46.011
with Martin as well ?

32:46.608 --> 32:48.600
Hey, you know what ?

32:48.695 --> 32:51.221
Martin couldn't have been
less interested in Daniels

32:51.235 --> 32:52.763
until I asked her out for dinner.

32:52.798 --> 32:54.890
Ok, we went out on two
dates, and then suddenly,

32:54.958 --> 32:57.563
suddenly, he's all over her.
Which I don't care about anymore.

32:57.565 --> 32:59.040
I mean, it was years ago.

33:00.876 --> 33:03.563
But the experience Daniels had
with Martin disqualified her

33:03.578 --> 33:05.190
from working on this
case, and not you ?

33:05.206 --> 33:07.620
Daniels had an intimate
relationship with the man,

33:07.635 --> 33:08.702
- I barely knew him.
- Well,

33:08.726 --> 33:10.332
that's a variation
of what I said to her.

33:10.356 --> 33:12.332
Because we have a team
here, it's working,

33:12.345 --> 33:13.981
and I'd like to keep
it that way. However,

33:14.006 --> 33:15.990
to be perfectly clear,

33:16.148 --> 33:18.630
you held back information about
the victim, and you shouldn't have.

33:18.707 --> 33:19.993
What did you want me to say ?

33:20.055 --> 33:21.520
Obviously, you could've spoken more

33:21.535 --> 33:23.162
on sexual pathology which,

33:23.178 --> 33:24.582
as you are aware, sergeant,

33:24.597 --> 33:27.501
is the most difficult aspect
of our personality to change.

33:27.798 --> 33:29.722
And which, as Xavier proves...

33:31.146 --> 33:32.590
Martin couldn't change.

33:32.636 --> 33:34.702
And that's relevant
to this investigation ?

33:34.717 --> 33:36.363
That Martin never changed.

33:37.457 --> 33:39.502
Oh, Sergeant, it's key.

33:51.137 --> 33:52.391
Any news, gentlemen ?

33:52.435 --> 33:55.131
Ok, we got back the DNA
results from the warehouse.

33:55.136 --> 33:57.293
The elimination samples
on Marak and martin.

33:57.305 --> 33:58.132
And ?

33:58.155 --> 34:01.091
Barak's blood matches what we
found at the Brentwood crime scene.

34:01.108 --> 34:02.830
So we take that along with his gun,

34:02.845 --> 34:05.293
and we can be pretty sure
he did those two kids.

34:05.507 --> 34:07.352
Good. Case closed.
What's the problem ?

34:07.398 --> 34:08.350
Well,

34:08.445 --> 34:11.203
the other elimination
sample from the warehouse.

34:11.427 --> 34:13.643
- Detective martin's, what about it ?
- It matches one of the samples

34:13.657 --> 34:15.953
we paid our informant 25,000 dollars

34:15.965 --> 34:17.701
to bring back from Vancouver.

34:21.998 --> 34:24.080
Martin booked samples of his own DNA ?

34:24.098 --> 34:25.469
And that of one of his relatives.

34:25.485 --> 34:27.292
I don't know if he swapped out
what he got from the informant,

34:27.304 --> 34:29.391
or if he ever even paid the guy.

34:29.425 --> 34:32.353
I'm uncomfortable suggesting
Martin had his hand in the till.

34:32.364 --> 34:33.672
This is a guy

34:33.737 --> 34:35.310
who was killed while trying to arrest

34:35.327 --> 34:37.123
- a murder suspect.
- We don't know that, commander.

34:37.138 --> 34:39.661
In fact, all we know for sure
is that someone else was there.

34:40.335 --> 34:42.263
Our informant is in Vegas.

34:42.286 --> 34:44.451
I'm not saying that bringing
him back will make him safer,

34:44.467 --> 34:45.630
just the opposite maybe.

34:45.677 --> 34:48.581
The name's already starting to
come out in her interrogations.

34:48.598 --> 34:51.522
Chief, I don't think he's going
to remain anonymous much longer.

34:52.118 --> 34:54.132
And we don't want to get
into a race with central.

34:54.138 --> 34:56.770
And there's stuff I have to
ask him. And now this DNA thing.

34:56.906 --> 34:58.741
All right. How long will
it take you to find him ?

34:58.748 --> 35:01.700
Lieutenant Flynn and Provenza
can go to Vegas tonight

35:01.725 --> 35:04.050
and bring our informant
back by tomorrow morning.

35:04.706 --> 35:06.940
I can authorize that trip
for you. Thank you. Gentlemen,

35:06.946 --> 35:09.142
you can get the informant
packet from Sergeant Gabriel

35:09.175 --> 35:11.013
and when Ari gets here,

35:11.047 --> 35:13.391
I want detective Xavier
in the room with me.

35:13.468 --> 35:15.842
All right, then. I gotta
run an errand, so thank you,

35:15.925 --> 35:17.131
very much.

35:28.235 --> 35:30.513
- Chief Johnson.
- Yes.

35:31.658 --> 35:34.443
I just want to make
sure I understand why

35:34.457 --> 35:36.470
you're bringing
detective Xavier back in.

35:36.487 --> 35:37.901
I want to question him.

35:38.816 --> 35:41.410
- Why ?
- Because I need more answers.

35:41.727 --> 35:44.390
Did you ever ask him where
he was last saturday morning

35:44.408 --> 35:46.161
when the murders were
committed because...

35:47.455 --> 35:49.263
I looked into it,
and he was at home

35:49.288 --> 35:51.541
- on the phone for two hours.
- Well, his line was busy.

35:51.545 --> 35:53.303
That doesn't mean he was on it.

35:53.955 --> 35:55.900
I'm trying to help you here, Chief.

35:56.455 --> 35:58.550
Xavier has an excellent record, and...

35:59.395 --> 36:02.032
yes, Tim Martin, he might
have been a womanizer, but

36:02.048 --> 36:05.002
if you can't tell how much
people respected him around here,

36:05.026 --> 36:06.511
- you're not looking.
- Trust me.

36:06.526 --> 36:07.642
I see it.

36:07.678 --> 36:10.031
If you end up smearing a man
who gave his life to the badge--

36:10.048 --> 36:11.930
I have factored your concerns

36:11.947 --> 36:13.621
into how I'm dealing with this case.

36:14.295 --> 36:15.940
Anything else, commander ?

36:15.975 --> 36:16.901
No, Ma'am.

36:17.887 --> 36:20.501
I'm just trying to be of assistance.

36:23.575 --> 36:25.860
And thanks for the message
you left on my website, too.

36:26.188 --> 36:28.212
I check it, like, 6 times a day.

36:28.975 --> 36:31.021
You put that website
together all by yourself ?

36:31.586 --> 36:33.901
WelI... had a little help from my dad.

36:34.456 --> 36:35.700
- Hey.
- Hey !

36:35.716 --> 36:36.341
Hi.

36:36.978 --> 36:38.612
Chief Johnson, what's up ?

36:38.656 --> 36:39.360
Here you go.

36:39.417 --> 36:41.303
I'm so sorry to intrude, but

36:41.307 --> 36:43.241
I think I might be in a position

36:43.257 --> 36:45.901
where I might really, really
need your help tomorrow.

36:51.667 --> 36:53.733
You knew as well as
I do how hard it is

36:53.746 --> 36:55.710
to get a homicide
detective to confess.

36:55.997 --> 36:58.190
The moment I mirandize
him, a lawyer will appear,

36:58.207 --> 36:59.483
and I'll be dead in the water.

36:59.488 --> 37:01.753
So I need to take him
completely by surprise.

37:02.617 --> 37:04.613
I heard Xavier had an alibi.

37:04.636 --> 37:06.490
It'll fall apart in the dryer.

37:06.616 --> 37:09.080
Look, I know you cared about Tim.

37:09.556 --> 37:12.511
And you're the only person left who
knows this case from front to back.

37:12.987 --> 37:14.452
Somebody is lying.

37:14.687 --> 37:16.492
And I think if I have you there,

37:16.526 --> 37:18.362
and if Xavier and Ari
don't know about it,

37:18.396 --> 37:19.901
somebody's gonna trip up.

37:21.077 --> 37:21.901
Ma'am...

37:22.708 --> 37:24.442
if I come downtown,

37:24.806 --> 37:27.413
and try and help you to arrest Xavier,

37:27.438 --> 37:29.440
and you don't have him cold,

37:30.015 --> 37:31.561
and I mean on ice,

37:32.267 --> 37:34.343
my whole division will turn against me.

37:38.487 --> 37:40.821
You said you wish'd you'd been
there for tim last saturday.

37:41.836 --> 37:44.721
There's nothing we can do to change that,
but you can be there for him tomorrow.

37:45.588 --> 37:47.360
I'm putting you at odds
with your entire division,

37:47.367 --> 37:49.203
and I'm so sorry about that, but

37:49.217 --> 37:51.901
I won't get this confession
without your help, Detective.

37:52.895 --> 37:54.913
Tim Martin was your friend. Please.

38:00.297 --> 38:03.013
I certainly hope you
know what you're doing.

38:03.308 --> 38:05.132
For both our sakes.

38:21.895 --> 38:22.933
Lieutenant Tao ?

38:23.608 --> 38:26.390
Yes, thank you. I need
you to make me a favor.

38:26.488 --> 38:29.393
It has to do with that sample of
DNA that we haven't identified yet.

38:58.496 --> 39:00.391
So, he's not in his room.

39:01.067 --> 39:04.042
And I think we've pretty well
determined he's not over here.

39:04.608 --> 39:06.960
Where'd you get that
shirt anyway ? The 80s ?

39:06.967 --> 39:08.051
Your ex wife loved it.

39:08.076 --> 39:10.811
Said it was easier to unbutton
than anything you ever wore.

39:11.796 --> 39:13.551
Put your glasses on, old man.

39:13.757 --> 39:17.362
Turn around and take a gander. Ari's
right over there playing blackjack.

39:17.438 --> 39:19.832
And there's two
open seats next to him.

39:19.845 --> 39:21.491
Now, I say,

39:21.538 --> 39:23.660
that we put him under
tight surveillance

39:23.667 --> 39:25.083
for an hour or so.

39:25.105 --> 39:27.341
You're kidding me, right ?
That's a 25 dollar table.

39:27.355 --> 39:29.391
There's an ATM next to the cashier.

39:29.416 --> 39:32.671
And I am feeling lucky...

39:45.395 --> 39:47.213
Sorry about that, Chief.

39:47.228 --> 39:49.212
- Give me a hundred.
- I already gave you a hundred.

39:49.216 --> 39:51.323
You're way up. So what ?

39:51.557 --> 39:54.023
You know where
the ATM is. Besides,

39:54.118 --> 39:56.201
- I say we cash in.
- All right. Fine, fine, fine.

39:56.215 --> 39:58.962
We'll cash in. Come on,
Ari. You're cashing in, too.

39:59.048 --> 40:00.152
Don't touch me.

40:00.167 --> 40:01.700
Who the hell are you anyway ?

40:02.495 --> 40:04.891
LAPD. We're here to
give you a lift home.

40:04.996 --> 40:06.732
Put that away, you stupid.

40:07.977 --> 40:08.903
Look...

40:09.565 --> 40:10.801
I'm not leaving.

40:10.817 --> 40:13.271
And you can't do anything
to me here anyway.

40:13.275 --> 40:14.491
Oh, really ?

40:14.867 --> 40:16.701
Hey everybody, listen up.

40:16.706 --> 40:18.631
I want to tell you
about my friend Ari.

40:18.635 --> 40:20.493
Shut up, you idiot.
You're gonna get me killed.

40:20.505 --> 40:21.593
Hey, moron,

40:21.615 --> 40:24.191
now imagine us doing
that only on television.

40:24.237 --> 40:27.131
And all of your cousin's friends
find out that you're a snitch.

40:28.768 --> 40:30.432
And don't forget to tip the dealer.

40:31.097 --> 40:32.092
Let's go.

40:53.287 --> 40:55.411
How do they always know ?

40:57.806 --> 40:59.193
Hi, mama.

40:59.208 --> 41:00.503
How are you ?

41:02.268 --> 41:03.501
I'm good.

41:03.697 --> 41:05.562
I'm at work, but I have a minute.

41:05.656 --> 41:06.902
Is everything all right ?

41:08.568 --> 41:09.802
Great aunt who ?

41:14.176 --> 41:16.072
Mama, is this
someone I've even met ?

41:17.205 --> 41:19.861
No, no. I just ran
upstairs. I'm out of breath.

41:21.067 --> 41:22.923
I don't know
where Santa Clarita is.

41:22.937 --> 41:24.502
It's just north of here.

41:25.567 --> 41:28.070
All right. I'll send her a
get well card or something.

41:29.528 --> 41:31.031
Can you spell her last name ?

41:32.367 --> 41:32.962
E

41:33.558 --> 41:34.280
U

41:35.156 --> 41:35.732
L

41:36.518 --> 41:37.031
E

41:37.467 --> 41:37.953
S

41:39.375 --> 41:39.652
S

41:40.146 --> 41:40.792
Mama,

41:41.248 --> 41:44.052
I have never met this woman
before in my life, I swear.

41:45.867 --> 41:47.432
Well...what's wrong with her ?

41:49.045 --> 41:50.343
for heaven's sake.

41:50.346 --> 41:52.523
If she's been in a coma for 2 years,

41:52.535 --> 41:53.961
how much worse can she get ?

41:56.375 --> 41:58.672
I can't talk about this
right now because I'm about to

41:58.808 --> 42:01.991
interview a serial killer who
just... stabbed 30 people to death.

42:04.348 --> 42:06.112
All right. All right then.

42:06.656 --> 42:07.901
OK. Bye.

42:08.885 --> 42:10.653
You got time for some coffee
before you head into work ?

42:10.668 --> 42:12.790
I do. I just, I have to get changed,

42:12.826 --> 42:14.712
and I want to look a little stern.

42:15.516 --> 42:17.020
That shouldn't be a problem.

42:18.687 --> 42:20.021
I forgot to ask you,

42:20.998 --> 42:22.371
did you ever talk to Pope ?

42:23.537 --> 42:25.553
About how he's doing with
the divorce and everything ?

42:25.557 --> 42:26.612
In passing.

42:27.107 --> 42:28.982
I haven't had time to get into details.

42:28.995 --> 42:31.781
I'm trying to think
through how Martin and Barak

42:32.055 --> 42:34.932
were murdered because I know who did
it, and I'm pretty sure of the motive,

42:34.955 --> 42:36.481
but I'm just not sure how.

42:37.017 --> 42:38.893
And I'm only gonna get one run at this,

42:38.895 --> 42:41.740
so Pope is not high
on my radar right now.

42:43.337 --> 42:44.902
You can bet you're on his.

42:46.327 --> 42:47.383
You watch.

42:48.008 --> 42:49.473
He's gonna ask you out again.

42:49.706 --> 42:50.993
Just so you know.

42:51.108 --> 42:54.051
And he's not gonna care
that we're dating or

42:54.936 --> 42:55.900
Whatever.

42:56.077 --> 42:57.682
Yeah, some guys are like that.

42:57.695 --> 42:59.033
Will's not like that.

43:01.037 --> 43:02.963
I will. You can think what you want.

43:03.397 --> 43:04.561
I don't trust him.

43:07.436 --> 43:08.110
What ?

43:09.597 --> 43:10.763
Are you wearing your gun ?

43:11.966 --> 43:13.392
- Yeah.
- Can I have it ?

43:13.567 --> 43:14.900
What's wrong with yours ?

43:16.297 --> 43:18.081
In case you hadn't
noticed, I'm off duty.

43:18.518 --> 43:19.130
So,

43:19.828 --> 43:22.090
would you...
let me borrow yours ?

43:22.295 --> 43:23.901
For a minute, please ?

43:33.505 --> 43:35.103
Could it really be that simple ?

43:38.207 --> 43:39.932
Bang. What are you doing ?

43:40.767 --> 43:41.900
Trust me.

43:43.366 --> 43:44.580
Trust me.

43:46.877 --> 43:48.950
Now, walk towards me.

43:49.046 --> 43:50.843
Like you're trying to
find out what I'm doing.

43:51.665 --> 43:53.461
I am trying to find
out what you're doing.

43:53.635 --> 43:54.421
Bang.

43:56.075 --> 43:56.903
See ?

43:58.146 --> 44:00.211
That's how I shoot
Barak with Martin's gun.

44:01.098 --> 44:03.550
And then I shoot Martin with Barak'S.

44:04.825 --> 44:05.903
That's how.

44:07.278 --> 44:09.963
Because he knew Barak
was coming. That's how.

44:17.218 --> 44:18.860
That's how. That's how,

44:18.878 --> 44:19.980
That's how, what ?

44:21.626 --> 44:22.952
That's how what ?

44:25.138 --> 44:27.281
I'll call you about dinner, okay ?

44:28.897 --> 44:29.943
Okay.

44:30.026 --> 44:31.782
No, wait. No, wait, wait. Brenda ?

44:31.797 --> 44:33.442
When are we gonna talk about...

44:36.576 --> 44:37.840
about everything.

44:43.216 --> 44:44.800
Ari Cohen is here.

44:45.496 --> 44:48.021
Daniels has him in an interview
room with detective Xavier.

44:48.706 --> 44:50.690
And central division
has arrived en masse.

44:51.207 --> 44:52.941
They think you're about to
arrest Xavier for murder.

44:52.957 --> 44:54.903
I mention that because having
him sit next to an informant

44:54.917 --> 44:57.333
with a camera trained on him
kind of makes the guy look guilty.

44:57.337 --> 44:58.843
Maybe you have an idea

44:58.855 --> 45:00.361
where I can place detective Xavier

45:00.368 --> 45:02.112
where he wouldn't look guilty.

45:02.127 --> 45:03.990
Or maybe you think that Tim Martin,

45:04.026 --> 45:06.000
who everyone says
was such a good cop,

45:06.038 --> 45:07.803
went into that warehouse alone.

45:08.265 --> 45:09.893
Where was our
good cop's backup then ?

45:09.938 --> 45:11.512
Why didn't his partner go with him ?

45:11.527 --> 45:13.483
Those are excellent questions,
but they're not evidence.

45:13.487 --> 45:16.533
And if you don't get a confession,
and you try to make an arrest...

45:20.405 --> 45:22.293
it's not gonna be
a real crowd pleaser.

45:22.678 --> 45:24.410
Not that I don't have
confidence in you.

45:25.688 --> 45:28.863
I'll get the confession, Will.
Never you mind. I'll get it.

45:31.746 --> 45:33.903
Ma'am, thank you very much.

45:35.947 --> 45:37.483
Did you make the match ?

45:37.496 --> 45:39.010
Any minute.

45:39.288 --> 45:40.802
You don't have it ?

45:41.258 --> 45:42.682
It's coming.

45:43.547 --> 45:44.890
Lieutenant Tao,

45:44.905 --> 45:47.133
I need to start this interview,
and I you don't finish,

45:47.145 --> 45:49.490
I could be up a nasty
smelling creek with no paddle.

45:49.536 --> 45:51.492
Just go slow.

45:51.505 --> 45:54.233
As soon as the match comes through,
I'll bring it directly to Gabriel.

45:55.295 --> 45:56.202
Here.

45:57.838 --> 45:59.420
For all our sakes.

46:00.777 --> 46:01.901
Please.

46:03.376 --> 46:04.692
Thank you.

46:30.828 --> 46:32.542
Here's the earpiece.
There's a new battery.

46:32.558 --> 46:34.992
Oh, thank you, Buzz.
Thank you very much.

46:35.906 --> 46:38.183
I thought we were
taking him by surprise.

46:38.198 --> 46:40.290
Well, I'm moving on to plan B.

46:40.305 --> 46:43.153
Ma'am, I want to note you've
used your investigation

46:43.168 --> 46:45.301
to smear Tim Martin's reputation.

46:45.335 --> 46:48.020
And in this department, that's
just not the way we play ball.

46:48.458 --> 46:51.042
Well, captain, if you don't
like the way I'm doing things,

46:51.058 --> 46:53.312
you're free to take your
balls and go straight home.

46:54.755 --> 46:56.501
Okay. So...

46:57.478 --> 46:59.391
when I flip the pages in my notebook,

46:59.406 --> 47:01.560
you give me a true or false, okay ?

47:02.216 --> 47:03.500
All right then.

47:05.707 --> 47:08.083
Detective Hubbard, I
just want to thank you

47:08.098 --> 47:11.060
for volunteering under such
extraordinary circumstances.

47:11.696 --> 47:13.491
And I think that everyone

47:13.557 --> 47:15.770
who cared about detective Martin

47:16.096 --> 47:18.642
will truely appreciate
what you do here today.

47:35.518 --> 47:37.571
Good morning, Detective Xavier.

47:37.778 --> 47:39.690
And the elusive mr. Cohen.

47:39.707 --> 47:41.541
Here you are.

47:41.995 --> 47:43.593
So kind of you to join us.

47:43.655 --> 47:45.363
I was dragged here against my will,

47:45.635 --> 47:47.751
and all I'm going to
do is plead the fifth.

47:48.086 --> 47:49.602
You can't plead the fifth.

47:50.306 --> 47:50.830
I can't ?

47:50.847 --> 47:53.673
It would be a violation of the
agreement you made with the D.A.

47:53.708 --> 47:55.222
To be a cooperating witness.

47:55.296 --> 47:56.482
So, if you plead the fifth,

47:56.496 --> 47:58.920
I'll arrest you as an
accomplice in a double homicide,

47:59.395 --> 48:01.420
so please, mr. Cohen,

48:01.797 --> 48:03.051
do take a seat.

48:05.438 --> 48:07.522
I didn't understand
what this was all about.

48:07.535 --> 48:10.313
- No one explained it to me.
- I don't even know why I'm here.

48:10.468 --> 48:12.453
Because. Someone's lying.

48:12.518 --> 48:14.883
And I thought if I got you
and Mr Cohen together here,

48:14.887 --> 48:16.320
I could figure out the truth.

48:16.436 --> 48:18.291
Are you saying
I've been dishonest ?

48:18.646 --> 48:21.250
You told me you'd never been
to detective Martin's house.

48:21.386 --> 48:23.082
And I have a witness
who contradicts you.

48:23.098 --> 48:24.950
She's a lying bitch !

48:25.016 --> 48:27.960
The kind of lying bitch who
deserves to be stalked by a cop ?

48:28.056 --> 48:30.181
Who should be harassed under
the color of authority ?

48:30.185 --> 48:31.221
That kind of bitch ?

48:34.355 --> 48:35.940
Do I need an attorney ?

48:35.967 --> 48:37.481
I don't know. Do you ?

48:41.376 --> 48:43.482
<i>So, tell me, mr. Cohen,</i>

48:43.978 --> 48:45.932
how well do you know
detective Xavier here ?

48:46.227 --> 48:48.203
Were you in contact
with him regularly ?

48:48.228 --> 48:50.620
- No.
- I met him exactly one time.

48:53.827 --> 48:56.171
That's probably true.
That's what Tim told me.

48:56.176 --> 48:57.692
That seems to be right, Chief.

48:57.725 --> 48:59.323
And you went to Vancouver

48:59.337 --> 49:01.641
to collect samples of
DNA from your cousin.

49:01.696 --> 49:03.192
Who did you give those samples to ?

49:03.216 --> 49:04.650
Detective Hubbard.

49:04.905 --> 49:06.093
Where is he anyway ?

49:06.106 --> 49:08.312
That's true. And then
I gave them to Tim.

49:08.927 --> 49:10.321
Okay. Hubbard says that's true.

49:10.338 --> 49:12.463
<i>Ari handed him the samples,
and then he gave them to Martin.</i>

49:12.476 --> 49:15.111
But those samples turned
out not to be of Barak.

49:15.376 --> 49:17.191
Yeah. And we asked him to get more.

49:17.257 --> 49:18.443
I done what they asked.

49:18.468 --> 49:20.040
They messed up, not me.

49:20.858 --> 49:24.293
What did they expect me to do, go
back, ask him to spit in the cup ?

49:24.746 --> 49:26.872
My cousin was a psycho, not an idiot.

49:26.908 --> 49:28.982
You never did crap. Probably
never went to see Barak

49:29.006 --> 49:31.400
- in the first place !
- Then why did i call you on wednesday

49:31.416 --> 49:33.113
and tell you he was coming to town ?

49:34.368 --> 49:36.502
He never mentioned
Barak was coming ?

49:36.796 --> 49:38.612
Ok. That's probably not true, Chief.

49:38.617 --> 49:40.490
<i>Bullshit.
You never called me at all !</i>

49:40.498 --> 49:42.432
<i>- That's right.
- I called detective Hubbard.</i>

49:42.828 --> 49:45.620
<i>I told him I had arranged to meet Zeev
at the warehouse on saturday morning,</i>

49:45.626 --> 49:46.990
<i>but they said
that you guys--</i>

49:47.006 --> 49:49.422
That is not true ! He asked to meet,

49:49.448 --> 49:50.843
and I told him to call Tim.

49:50.855 --> 49:52.970
All right, okay. Did
you hear that, Chief ?

49:52.985 --> 49:54.691
We never heard anything
about a meeting.

49:54.695 --> 49:56.853
- With you or anybody !
- Are you sure,

49:57.345 --> 49:58.493
Detective Xavier ?

49:58.515 --> 50:00.710
You're taking this lying
scumbag's word over mine.

50:01.275 --> 50:03.432
I already told you.
Martin never mentioned it.

50:03.485 --> 50:04.842
And all this stuff about DNA

50:04.855 --> 50:06.703
happened before
I was even on the case.

50:06.987 --> 50:08.661
So what does this have to do with me ?

50:08.926 --> 50:11.171
<i>Chief, Tao's here with your papers.</i>

50:11.306 --> 50:13.502
I'll be back in one
minute to answer that.

50:23.168 --> 50:24.943
Ok, I have to hurry now.

50:24.988 --> 50:27.970
Because I'm about 2 minutes from
having to read someone their rights.

50:28.258 --> 50:29.500
Thank you.

50:30.008 --> 50:31.920
- Detective hubbard, please.
- Yes, Ma'am.

50:31.928 --> 50:34.741
I need your help getting
these DNA results in order.

50:35.328 --> 50:36.082
Okay.

50:36.646 --> 50:38.470
- See if this is right.
- Okay.

50:38.486 --> 50:40.993
Barak's blood from the
Brentwood crime scene.

50:41.988 --> 50:44.270
Barak's blood from the warehouse.

50:44.595 --> 50:46.492
- A match.
- That's right.

50:46.688 --> 50:48.150
And then here...

50:48.767 --> 50:51.051
Martin's blood from the warehouse,

50:51.068 --> 50:53.490
which just happens to match up

50:53.678 --> 50:55.150
with one of the samples that

50:55.165 --> 50:57.040
Ari brought back from Vancouver.

50:58.387 --> 50:59.501
What ?

51:00.396 --> 51:02.782
the two DNA samples that we thought

51:02.816 --> 51:04.521
were obtained by your informant,

51:04.538 --> 51:06.581
one was actually that of Tim Martin,

51:06.598 --> 51:07.830
and the other

51:07.845 --> 51:10.341
was one of his male relatives,

51:10.578 --> 51:13.093
which lieutenant Tao
has just identified...

51:13.107 --> 51:14.432
as your

51:14.638 --> 51:15.832
son.

51:17.996 --> 51:20.251
Or I guess I should say, Martin's son,

51:20.266 --> 51:21.803
by your wife.

51:23.068 --> 51:24.992
We matched it up against
the online database

51:25.005 --> 51:28.063
where you posted Charlie's
bone marrow looking for a donor.

51:29.706 --> 51:31.161
My guess is,

51:31.176 --> 51:34.091
you didn't know you weren't
Charlie's biological father

51:34.248 --> 51:37.652
until the doctors checked to see if
you're a possible transplant candidate.

51:38.457 --> 51:39.903
Isn't that right ?

51:43.825 --> 51:46.931
And so you began to
wonder who Charlie's father

51:47.195 --> 51:48.842
really was.

51:49.238 --> 51:51.500
And you knew your partner,
didn't you ?

51:52.047 --> 51:53.801
You knew him very well.

51:54.998 --> 51:58.093
And Martin never volunteered to have
his own bone marrow tested, did he ?

51:59.806 --> 52:01.451
See, we went on Charlie's website

52:01.468 --> 52:03.431
where he thanks everyone
who's volunteered,

52:03.446 --> 52:05.300
and Martin's name isn't on it.

52:05.868 --> 52:08.191
I guess he was afraid
you'd find out the truth.

52:08.208 --> 52:09.762
It's pretty awful, really.

52:09.795 --> 52:12.310
That he cared more about
that than saving his own son.

52:12.497 --> 52:13.381
But then

52:13.645 --> 52:15.551
he knew you pretty well, too.

52:17.205 --> 52:20.170
So, when Ari came back from
Vancouver with Barak's DNA,

52:20.305 --> 52:22.933
you switched them out with samples
that you took from your partner

52:22.946 --> 52:25.591
and Charlie just to
make sure you were right.

52:25.628 --> 52:28.091
And, I suppose, to see if
Martin might be a possible match

52:28.108 --> 52:30.110
for a transplant, but he wasn't.

52:30.797 --> 52:33.000
Also, on this blog your son keeps,

52:33.595 --> 52:35.893
he lists what happens to him
every day in the hospital.

52:36.596 --> 52:38.993
Last saturday morning when you said
you went with him for a procedure,

52:39.088 --> 52:41.193
a transfusion of white
blood cells, well,

52:41.217 --> 52:42.791
the specialist got called away

52:42.805 --> 52:44.792
and the procedure was cancelled.

52:44.857 --> 52:46.821
And when Charlie finally
came back to his room,

52:47.105 --> 52:48.373
you weren't there.

52:48.695 --> 52:50.410
And didn't come back for

52:50.468 --> 52:51.960
an hour and a half.

52:54.798 --> 52:56.660
Look, listen...

52:58.195 --> 53:00.330
Tim shot Barak.

53:00.578 --> 53:03.093
The bullet was fired from his gun.

53:03.115 --> 53:04.843
But Martin didn't have his gun.

53:04.887 --> 53:06.300
He'd given it to you.

53:06.306 --> 53:09.040
- Oh, why would he do that ?
- Because you asked him for it.

53:09.515 --> 53:11.953
Because you volunteered to
go with him to the warehouse,

53:11.976 --> 53:14.400
and he agreed because you
were the partner he trusted.

53:15.638 --> 53:17.690
And you really needed
that gun, didn't you ?

53:18.595 --> 53:21.702
Because detective Xavier and
Ari are both telling the truth.

53:22.148 --> 53:25.070
And you were the only one who
knew that it wasn't an informant

53:25.085 --> 53:27.273
who was about to walk through
the doors at that warehouse,

53:27.286 --> 53:29.013
but an armed psychopath.

53:29.866 --> 53:31.602
My guess is... that

53:31.637 --> 53:33.631
you shot Barak as soon as you were sure

53:33.646 --> 53:36.462
that he was close enough
for it to be a clean kill,

53:36.626 --> 53:38.590
and while Martin was freaking out,

53:38.608 --> 53:40.252
demanding to know what you were doing,

53:40.266 --> 53:42.192
you told him to trust you.

53:42.315 --> 53:43.202
Didn't you ?

53:43.785 --> 53:46.740
You walked over to Barak's
body. You knelt down beside him,

53:46.778 --> 53:49.033
took his gun, and while
Martin followed you,

53:49.036 --> 53:51.080
demanding an explanation, you shot him

53:51.098 --> 53:54.012
dead between the eyes.
Isn't that right, detective ?

53:58.788 --> 54:01.192
By the way, does Charlie know...

54:02.108 --> 54:04.661
that Tim's his real father ? I mean...

54:05.088 --> 54:07.713
I only ask because once you
bring a lawyer into this,

54:07.726 --> 54:09.481
Tim's son will have to be deposed.

54:09.486 --> 54:11.081
Tim's son ?

54:11.475 --> 54:13.660
I wonder what effect that
will have on Charlie's health ?

54:14.407 --> 54:16.670
Knowing you're not
his real dad, I mean.

54:17.147 --> 54:18.482
Tim's son ?

54:19.396 --> 54:21.542
How do you suppose
Charlie's gonna react

54:22.286 --> 54:24.152
knowing that you gunned down his father

54:24.168 --> 54:25.902
- in cold.
- I'm his father !

54:26.737 --> 54:28.520
Charlie's my son !

54:29.625 --> 54:31.271
I taught him how to walk.

54:31.306 --> 54:33.092
And I taught him how to read.

54:33.116 --> 54:34.501
And I taught him...

54:39.506 --> 54:42.181
I've been with him
through 7 surgeries,

54:43.158 --> 54:45.561
and 38 procedures.

54:48.488 --> 54:50.143
And where was

54:50.168 --> 54:52.040
the great Tim Martin

54:52.157 --> 54:53.960
when it mattered, huh ?

54:55.886 --> 54:57.300
Where was he...

54:57.785 --> 54:59.531
when Charlie's life

54:59.547 --> 55:02.381
was on the line ? Where was
he ? Where was Tim Martin ?

55:03.598 --> 55:05.412
I don't know, detective Hubbard.

55:07.138 --> 55:08.900
But I know where he is now.

55:11.105 --> 55:13.730
I saw his brains splattered
all over the floor

55:13.747 --> 55:15.703
of an abandoned
warehouse while his body

55:15.706 --> 55:18.012
was being eaten by flies.

55:18.898 --> 55:20.631
And I can't help but think...

55:21.798 --> 55:23.551
you may have overreacted.

55:29.866 --> 55:31.041
You can't...

55:31.588 --> 55:33.521
you can't tell...

55:33.926 --> 55:35.553
Charlie about Tim.

55:35.888 --> 55:37.961
No, you won't do that.

55:39.075 --> 55:40.050
I can.

55:40.985 --> 55:42.300
And I will.

55:46.358 --> 55:47.862
Write it all down.

55:48.305 --> 55:50.270
And we'll get you a deal from the D.A.

55:54.578 --> 55:56.490
You can wear a bracelet

55:56.535 --> 55:58.910
and stay with Charlie
until his illness...

56:01.195 --> 56:02.601
resolves itself.

56:22.945 --> 56:26.163
Even though, intellectually, people
understand you did the right thing,

56:26.485 --> 56:29.032
emotionally, there is gonna be
some fall out over all of this.

56:29.868 --> 56:31.030
Between you and the department.

56:31.058 --> 56:32.670
Between your squad and the department.

56:32.697 --> 56:34.301
We can cope with that.

56:39.878 --> 56:41.301
I know it's late, but...

56:41.805 --> 56:44.171
I thought you might
have time for a... drink.

56:47.437 --> 56:48.900
Or dinner, if you're hungry.

56:49.945 --> 56:51.690
And as I remember things, you're

56:51.695 --> 56:53.623
kind of always hungry,

56:53.766 --> 56:54.890
aren't you ?

56:58.868 --> 56:59.902
I am.

57:02.325 --> 57:03.501
But,

57:03.875 --> 57:05.581
well, dinner.

57:06.648 --> 57:08.300
I already have plans.

57:09.388 --> 57:10.501
Sort of a...

57:10.895 --> 57:13.470
celebration. With Fritz.

57:16.005 --> 57:18.211
I heard he might be leaving town.

57:18.545 --> 57:21.101
Behavioral sciences,
right ? That's good for him.

57:21.498 --> 57:23.732
No, no. He's not taking that.

57:23.795 --> 57:24.792
No,

57:24.805 --> 57:27.053
we're celebrating because he's...

57:27.556 --> 57:29.131
moving in. Next week.

57:38.606 --> 57:40.371
That's great. Congratulations.

57:40.395 --> 57:42.803
We'll see. Big step.

57:44.587 --> 57:47.051
But, lunch tomorrow. I could do that.

57:48.727 --> 57:50.851
I have to meet with my
attorney at 1:00 tomorrow.

57:51.676 --> 57:53.202
We'll find a moment somewhere.

57:54.246 --> 57:55.300
All right then.

57:57.868 --> 57:59.621
Thanks for supporting me.

57:59.717 --> 58:01.933
- It meant a lot.
- Sure.

58:02.856 --> 58:05.200
My pleasure. My job, actually.

58:06.696 --> 58:07.852
Well !

58:08.807 --> 58:10.932
- Good night.
- Good night.

58:10.945 --> 58:11.901
And, uh...

58:13.767 --> 58:14.901
good work.

58:15.636 --> 58:18.491
Oh, thanks. Thanks.
