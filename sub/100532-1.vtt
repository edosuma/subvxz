*eerie music playing*

01:14.341 --> 01:18.677
Oh, I'm so hungry.

01:18.679 --> 01:28.087
If only there was some juicy,
delectable, tasty humans.

01:28.089 --> 01:33.525
But wait. I see one, two.

01:34.595 --> 01:37.796
But which one will I eat first?

01:37.798 --> 01:38.497
Her.

01:38.499 --> 01:39.849
Her.

01:39.850 --> 01:41.200
Her? You think her?

01:41.202 --> 01:45.771
Well, maybe I'm gonna eat
her anyway. Ahhh!

01:45.773 --> 01:46.772
*laughs*

01:46.774 --> 01:47.840
Oh, I've got you.

01:47.842 --> 01:50.109
*footsteps*

01:52.613 --> 01:54.279
Oh, I'm gonna miss you girls.

01:54.281 --> 01:55.714
I hate it when you're away.

01:55.716 --> 01:57.733
When will you be back?

01:57.734 --> 01:59.751
It's just a couple of days
this time, alright?

01:59.753 --> 02:03.355
Enough scary stories. Bed time.

02:03.357 --> 02:05.557
No.

02:05.559 --> 02:07.826
Come on. Bed time

02:07.828 --> 02:10.362
Okay. Why don't you guys go
and brush your teeth

02:10.364 --> 02:13.132
and I'll come upstairs, and
we'll read that book that you
love, okay?

02:13.134 --> 02:16.435
Okay. Go. Go. Quickly. Race.

02:16.437 --> 02:17.903
*running*

02:17.905 --> 02:19.771
I could get used to this.

02:21.475 --> 02:22.741
Yeah. This...

02:24.578 --> 02:26.845
this conference is...

02:26.847 --> 02:31.583
It's the most important thing
ever. I know. You already said
that.

02:31.585 --> 02:33.852
Yeah. It's a big one.
It's a game changer.

02:33.854 --> 02:36.855
Yeah, same as the last one,
and the next one after that.

02:36.857 --> 02:40.726
Because I don't wanna, I don't
wanna bring the girls up in my
Mom's old house

02:40.728 --> 02:43.662
and I want them to have
their own bedrooms.

02:43.664 --> 02:46.465
*sighs*

02:46.466 --> 02:49.267
They love sharing, you know?
Almost as much as they love
their Dad coming home.

02:49.270 --> 02:58.377
Yeah, well, this is it and then
I am all theirs, and I'm all
ours.

03:00.314 --> 03:01.713
If that's okay, huh?

03:12.960 --> 03:14.459
Bye.

Jess, you seen the book the
girls love?

03:44.325 --> 03:47.559

04:05.779 --> 04:08.814
Babe. I'm gonna check
if it's in the car.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.278
What the fuck?

*glass breaks*

04:40.581 --> 04:42.648
*door slam*

04:45.452 --> 04:46.885
What's wrong with Mommy?

04:46.887 --> 04:48.954
*screams*

04:48.956 --> 04:54.826
Baby, you stay here with Mommy.
Don't move. Don't move.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.022
Baby?

05:25.926 --> 05:26.992
Baby?

05:30.030 --> 05:34.066
Oh, baby. Baby, give me your
hand.

05:34.068 --> 05:36.068
Baby, it's okay.

05:36.070 --> 05:38.337
It's okay. Give me your hand.

05:39.106 --> 05:40.839
Baby, come on. It's okay.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.908
Baby.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.115
*whispers* Stay there.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.594
Welcome to paradise.

06:35.596 --> 06:37.129
See anything on your way in?

06:37.131 --> 06:39.398
*wheezes*

06:47.908 --> 06:50.776
Aah!

06:55.783 --> 06:58.450
*chains clinking*

07:03.457 --> 07:04.790
It's no use.

07:04.792 --> 07:05.791
Oh fuck!

07:07.661 --> 07:11.997
Oh, God. Jess. The kids.

07:11.999 --> 07:15.567
No. No. No. Fuck, no.

07:15.569 --> 07:17.469
He doesn't want them.

07:17.471 --> 07:19.104
Only you.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.740
What's your name?

07:23.110 --> 07:24.743
Jay.

07:26.013 --> 07:27.212
Adam.

07:27.214 --> 07:28.680
Kat.

07:28.682 --> 07:31.016
*wheezing*

07:34.521 --> 07:35.987
What is this place?

07:35.989 --> 07:38.056
As bad as it looks, man.

07:40.727 --> 07:42.661
I gotta get the fuck outta here.

08:21.502 --> 08:23.134
You behave, you stay here.

08:23.136 --> 08:26.071
You don't, you go back.
Understand?

08:32.513 --> 08:33.278
Eat.

08:35.616 --> 08:36.915
*sighs*

08:45.893 --> 08:47.192
I said eat, boy.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.595

What do we do when we're upset?

11:00.727 --> 11:01.793
Remember.

11:01.795 --> 11:03.728
Remember what?

11:04.164 --> 11:05.230
Who saved me.

11:05.232 --> 11:08.233
Yeah. Good boy. Hmm?

11:08.235 --> 11:10.702
I just want my Mom.

11:10.704 --> 11:14.773
Your mother and father are scum.
They abandoned you.

11:14.775 --> 11:20.045
If they cared about you, they'd
have come looking for you, now,
wouldn't they?

11:21.748 --> 11:23.448
I'm your father now.

11:24.885 --> 11:28.086
And if you upset me,
I swear to fucking God...

11:29.823 --> 11:33.091
*whispers* Yeah. That's a good
boy.

Who's doing this?

12:04.725 --> 12:06.725
*restrains retracting*

12:06.727 --> 12:08.727
He was there when I got here.

12:08.729 --> 12:11.096
Kat calls him Paul.

12:11.098 --> 12:11.996
*wheezes*

12:11.998 --> 12:13.832
After my cat.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.467
Paul doesn't say much.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.003
*chains*

12:19.005 --> 12:21.773
Where were you when
you were taken?

12:21.775 --> 12:23.408
Parking lot after a night out.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.944
Working the graveyard shift.

12:55.909 --> 12:57.475
It's his playground.

12:58.478 --> 12:59.878
Whose?

12:59.880 --> 13:01.946
*wheezes*

13:04.885 --> 13:07.252
See, this must have been a
mistake

13:07.254 --> 13:09.254
'cause I'm a good person.

13:09.256 --> 13:11.790
I didn't do anything wrong.

13:11.792 --> 13:15.160
You see, I do charity. I...

13:15.162 --> 13:17.562
I gave blood once.

13:17.564 --> 13:19.864
Oh, get used to that shit.

13:19.866 --> 13:22.967
A big fan of the red stuff.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.203
I take it you've tried
to talk to this prick?

13:25.205 --> 13:30.041
Oh, yeah. I've tried to hug
it out, bought him flowers.

13:30.043 --> 13:33.044
One guy did all this? I mean,
you're a fucking cop!

13:33.046 --> 13:34.579
Security guard.

13:34.581 --> 13:36.047
Well, you are.

13:36.049 --> 13:37.949
*wheezes*

13:37.951 --> 13:39.050

14:48.955 --> 14:50.255
Father, I'm sorry!

14:50.257 --> 14:51.055
Are ya?

14:51.057 --> 14:51.923
Yes!

14:51.925 --> 14:52.657
Say it again.

14:52.659 --> 14:53.458
I'm sorry!

14:53.460 --> 14:54.459
Ssh.

14:54.461 --> 14:56.527
*screams*

15:00.567 --> 15:02.567
That's it. Let the evil out.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.259
What was that?

15:28.261 --> 15:29.694
Feeding time.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.095
What's with the lights?

15:31.097 --> 15:32.697
Well, it ain't fucking
Christmas.

15:32.699 --> 15:35.633
What, so he warns you
before he tortures you?

15:35.635 --> 15:37.135
Yep.

15:37.137 --> 15:41.372
Only it's not him that
does the torturing.

15:42.309 --> 15:43.474
Who does?

15:43.476 --> 15:46.611
*wheezes*

16:07.300 --> 16:08.967
You're his pets.

16:08.969 --> 16:11.336
It's not even cooked.

16:11.338 --> 16:14.505
*meat chewing*

16:14.507 --> 16:17.675
No thanks. I'm vegan.

16:17.677 --> 16:19.344
*laughs*

16:19.346 --> 16:21.612
Of course, by vegan
you mean fucked.

16:21.614 --> 16:25.550
Well don't waste it.
Throw it back.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.752
*meat chewing*

16:27.754 --> 16:29.988
Quite the summer
camp, ain't it?

16:29.990 --> 16:32.123
It's a big mistake, not eating.

16:32.125 --> 16:34.125
Not exactly Mother Theresa.

16:34.127 --> 16:36.461
*wheezes*

16:36.463 --> 16:38.162
What about Paul?

16:38.164 --> 16:40.164
He gets injections.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.233
They keep him alive.

16:46.239 --> 16:48.106
That's your future, right there.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.108
*chewing food*

16:50.110 --> 16:52.176
You two can do
what you want

16:52.178 --> 16:55.346
but I'm getting outta
here if it kills me.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.716
A very poor choice of words.

16:58.718 --> 17:02.620
*wheezes*

17:06.292 --> 17:08.359
*grunts*

17:08.361 --> 17:10.128
Come on!

17:10.130 --> 17:11.529
Any loose?

17:11.531 --> 17:12.764
Not yet.

17:12.766 --> 17:14.265
*scraping the wall*

17:14.267 --> 17:15.500
Nothing your side?

17:15.502 --> 17:17.035
Found this.

17:18.438 --> 17:20.638
Not been very lucky for me.

17:23.176 --> 17:23.775
What?

17:27.680 --> 17:30.415
*laughs*

17:30.417 --> 17:32.750
It's a waste of time.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.453
Like your police application?

17:35.455 --> 17:37.155
Like your mom's labor.

17:37.157 --> 17:39.590
*laughs*

17:39.592 --> 17:42.160
*panting*

17:42.162 --> 17:43.628
Not got any keys?

17:43.630 --> 17:44.662
Nope.

17:44.664 --> 17:46.564
Do you have any?

17:46.566 --> 17:48.633
*laughs*

17:51.771 --> 17:53.471
*screams*

17:54.374 --> 17:55.840
Shit!

17:57.444 --> 18:00.578
*groants*

18:00.580 --> 18:02.447
A hundred years,
and nails like

18:02.449 --> 18:05.349
Freddy fucking Krueger
wouldn't get through it.

18:05.351 --> 18:06.417
*groants*

18:06.419 --> 18:08.486
Or you could learn
the hard way.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.390
Adam's right.

18:12.391 --> 18:14.291
The only way out is
through that door.

18:17.497 --> 18:21.699
*wheezes*

18:22.735 --> 18:23.634
*sighs*

18:23.636 --> 18:26.637
*panting*

18:26.639 --> 18:32.276
*chains clanking*

18:33.613 --> 18:36.548
Hey.

18:36.549 --> 18:39.484
Seriously. If he sees you doing
that, he'll go fucking insane.

18:39.486 --> 18:42.353
I had an ex just like you.

18:42.355 --> 18:44.122
He wouldn't give up either.

18:44.124 --> 18:48.659
I had to get his Dad arrested
for raping me, just to get rid
of him.

18:48.661 --> 18:49.627
So he deserved it.

18:49.629 --> 18:52.363
Oh, he didn't touch me.

18:54.200 --> 18:58.436
When I was 15, I'd set up
dates with married guys.

18:58.872 --> 19:00.471
Take pictures

19:01.274 --> 19:03.207
send them to their wives.

19:03.710 --> 19:06.177
*wheezes*

19:06.179 --> 19:08.246
Fucking perverts.

19:09.582 --> 19:11.782
I'd give a nut right now
to be back at home.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.885
Guess which one's
gonna happen first?

19:13.887 --> 19:16.754
Gives the old ball and chain
a whole new meaning, huh?

19:18.191 --> 19:21.726
You guys are fucking
insane, you know that?

19:23.763 --> 19:26.164
*diggind with a bone

19:26.166 --> 19:28.599
Wait. Wait, wait. *laughs* Wait.

19:28.601 --> 19:31.169
*diggind with a bone

19:31.171 --> 19:33.388
Don't.

19:33.389 --> 19:35.606
If Frankenstein comes back in,
we'll all lose our fuckin'
balls.

19:35.608 --> 19:37.675
*groants*

19:39.646 --> 19:43.814
*sand falling from skull*

19:46.920 --> 19:50.488
*cutting meat*

19:50.490 --> 19:54.659
*vacuum cleaner*

20:02.835 --> 20:06.771
*knife clanking*

20:09.876 --> 20:13.511
*intensive sound effect*

20:13.513 --> 20:15.580

20:17.884 --> 20:19.750
Dominic

20:23.356 --> 20:26.524
*heavy breathing*

20:30.763 --> 20:33.564
*fridge door closes*

20:33.566 --> 20:35.633
*footsteps*

20:41.774 --> 20:46.877
*plastic crunching*

20:55.955 --> 20:58.256
*squeaking chair*

20:59.659 --> 21:01.826
*chess figure tapping*

21:03.997 --> 21:06.330
Playing it safe, huh?

21:12.739 --> 21:16.040
*chess figure taping*

21:22.482 --> 21:23.948
Why did you do that?

21:24.817 --> 21:26.317
I don't know.

21:26.319 --> 21:27.585
You don't know.

21:29.322 --> 21:31.522
But you chose to do it.

21:33.359 --> 21:35.993
You see, every maneuver is a
promise.

21:35.995 --> 21:40.464
A promise to your next maneuver
and your next one.

21:40.466 --> 21:45.002
'Cause life's all about choices.
When you got no choice

21:45.938 --> 21:47.471
you got nothing.

21:51.511 --> 21:53.911
You chose to be here
with me, didn't you?

21:56.449 --> 21:57.648
Dominic.

22:00.420 --> 22:04.522
*chair sqeaking*

22:05.825 --> 22:06.891
Dominic.

22:07.894 --> 22:10.594
I'm asking you a question.

22:11.931 --> 22:12.897
*object push*

22:12.899 --> 22:14.999
*shouting* Answer me!

22:15.001 --> 22:19.337
*coughs*

22:23.810 --> 22:26.577
*running water*

22:28.514 --> 22:30.448

22:37.890 --> 22:38.856
Ugh!

22:40.860 --> 22:42.960

22:42.962 --> 22:46.964
*running

22:52.839 --> 22:58.642
*shouts*

23:01.748 --> 23:06.117
Your mother and father are scum.
They abandoned you.

23:06.119 --> 23:10.020
If they cared about you, they'd
have come looking for you now,
wouldn't they?

23:10.923 --> 23:14.759
I'm your father now.

23:18.431 --> 23:21.665
*bottles clinking*

23:22.735 --> 23:26.570

*door closes*

24:09.615 --> 24:11.682
*insect noises*

24:25.064 --> 24:27.798
I need to tell you a secret.

24:33.806 --> 24:36.540
This is the world that
left you for dead.

24:36.542 --> 24:39.910
*clock ticking*

24:39.912 --> 24:42.847
But ours isn't a strange
world, is it, son?

24:42.849 --> 24:47.151
*clock ticking*

24:48.754 --> 24:52.022
I'll never let anyone
hurt you again.

25:00.833 --> 25:02.666
Promise you'll never leave me.

25:03.102 --> 25:04.869
Yes, father.

25:04.871 --> 25:07.505
And you'll grow big and strong?

25:07.507 --> 25:08.906
I promise.

25:10.209 --> 25:11.242
Show me.

25:11.944 --> 25:14.144
*footsteps*

25:14.146 --> 25:19.016
Grow big and strong,
just like him.

25:20.119 --> 25:22.953
*laughs*

25:44.944 --> 25:46.877
It's beautiful.

25:46.879 --> 25:49.880
*coughs*

25:49.882 --> 25:51.949
*footsteps*

25:58.925 --> 26:00.858
We're just like each other

26:00.860 --> 26:02.927
one and the same.

26:05.965 --> 26:07.831
*knife pull*

26:14.574 --> 26:16.607
Not all of us are kind.

26:16.609 --> 26:20.244
Some of us need to have
the evil taken out of us.

26:20.246 --> 26:22.313
Does that mean you're evil too?

26:22.882 --> 26:26.067
Yeah.

26:26.068 --> 26:29.253
See, sometimes, we do bad things
and the only way to take the bad
out is through pain.

26:32.124 --> 26:33.791
I want you to stab it.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.226
Remove the evil.

26:38.197 --> 26:40.965
It's what's gonna make you a
man, Dominic.

26:40.967 --> 26:42.766
Healing through pain.

26:42.768 --> 26:44.802
*dramatic music plays*

26:44.804 --> 26:49.073
I promise. I'm not
gonna punish you.

26:49.075 --> 26:51.075

26:53.746 --> 26:55.813

26:56.682 --> 26:58.248
Oh, that's it.

26:58.250 --> 27:00.250
That's it.

27:00.252 --> 27:04.989
Oh, good boy. Huh? That
wasn't so bad, was it?

27:06.292 --> 27:07.191
Huh?

27:08.728 --> 27:10.327
Watch the evil, huh?

27:11.330 --> 27:12.796
Watch it leave me.

27:15.101 --> 27:17.234
*lightbulb buzzing*

27:25.111 --> 27:27.711
Oh, you...

27:27.713 --> 27:30.381
You motherfucker.

27:31.050 --> 27:33.050
What? What is it?

27:33.052 --> 27:36.253
Oh, come on, then,
you fucking pussy.

27:36.255 --> 27:38.055
You enjoy watching--

27:38.057 --> 27:40.057
*electricity noises*

27:40.059 --> 27:41.692
Have you never noticed this?

27:41.694 --> 27:44.361
Shut the fuck up for our sakes.

27:44.363 --> 27:46.063
What are you hiding from?

27:46.065 --> 27:49.933
I'm married, you prick.
I have a fucking life.

27:49.935 --> 27:50.868

for you, you fucking asshole!

28:35.981 --> 28:37.314
Jay ,please, Adam's right.

28:37.316 --> 28:38.982
*shouting* Come on, film this!

28:38.984 --> 28:40.818
*lights going out*

28:41.220 --> 28:42.486
Great.

28:42.488 --> 28:45.456
Great, thank you.
Thank you so much!

29:42.081 --> 29:43.781
Hey!

29:43.783 --> 29:45.315
My wife and my daughters.

29:46.418 --> 29:47.851
Are they alright?

29:51.957 --> 29:54.024
Does that mean they're okay?

30:22.054 --> 30:23.187
Don't.

30:23.189 --> 30:25.122
You gotta let him, man.

30:25.124 --> 30:27.391
Or he'll go for our families.

30:27.393 --> 30:30.060

She's fucking choking!

34:43.715 --> 34:46.783
You can talk to me, you know.

34:55.127 --> 34:56.726
What are you looking at?

34:57.563 --> 34:58.728
Nothing.

34:59.565 --> 35:00.797
Bring it here.

35:02.501 --> 35:06.369
*chair squeaking*

35:12.478 --> 35:13.677
Who did that?

35:17.816 --> 35:19.549
Doesn't matter.

35:21.887 --> 35:23.220
Why?

35:23.221 --> 35:24.554
I said it doesn't matter.

35:25.157 --> 35:26.389
Sit down.

35:26.391 --> 35:28.558
How come it doesn't matter?

35:28.560 --> 35:30.393
*shouting* Sit!

35:33.599 --> 35:35.599
Come here.

Fuck you, man. How many
times I gotta tell you?

36:12.804 --> 36:17.207
Paul tried that. You
wanna be like him?

36:17.209 --> 36:19.276
Oh, fuck.

Grass greener on the other side
of the door, asshole?

37:55.941 --> 37:57.440
Is there a way out?

37:59.378 --> 38:02.879
Oh, so we didn't suffer for
nothing. Great.

38:04.683 --> 38:07.350
We can escape.

38:07.352 --> 38:08.685
*sighs*

38:08.687 --> 38:10.987
We just need to be clever.

38:10.989 --> 38:13.056
*wheezes*

38:14.660 --> 38:16.059
What's he doing?

38:17.062 --> 38:18.928
He's just pissed you're back.

38:18.930 --> 38:21.631
Why is everything a
fucking joke to you?

38:21.633 --> 38:23.700
The joke's on us, my friend!

38:37.816 --> 38:39.916
What's he doing?

38:39.918 --> 38:41.418
Why doesn't he just kill us?

38:41.420 --> 38:44.087
No one throw away
their favorite toys.

39:57.496 --> 39:58.528
*coughs*

39:58.530 --> 40:00.597
Adam, please don't!

43:06.217 --> 43:09.252
You promised you were
gonna spent more time with us...

43:10.055 --> 43:10.920
Jay!

43:10.922 --> 43:12.505
Hey.

43:12.506 --> 43:14.089
Jay! You've gotta
stay with us.

43:14.092 --> 43:20.763
*panting*

43:22.233 --> 43:24.100
*wheezes*

43:27.772 --> 43:29.138
You guys ever seen his face?

43:29.140 --> 43:30.907
Oh yeah, he's gorgeous.

43:30.909 --> 43:32.809
No. We haven't.

43:32.811 --> 43:34.877
*wheezes*

43:35.747 --> 43:37.947
So what's the freak hiding?

43:37.949 --> 43:40.817
I don't know. Probably just
ugly.
Never kissed a girl.

43:40.819 --> 43:42.769
No, specifics.

43:42.770 --> 43:44.720
Come on, you guys have clapped
eyes on him more than me.

43:44.723 --> 43:45.855
He stinks.

43:45.857 --> 43:48.157
Yeah. We all stink.

43:48.159 --> 43:48.858
More.

43:48.860 --> 43:50.059
*moans*

43:50.061 --> 43:51.127
He doesn't speak.

43:51.129 --> 43:52.228
Right. More.

43:52.230 --> 43:54.297
Paul, shut the fuck up.

44:02.073 --> 44:03.873
What was that?

44:03.875 --> 44:04.974
Just leave him be.

44:04.976 --> 44:06.776
Schh!

44:06.778 --> 44:08.778
He's trying to speak.

44:08.780 --> 44:10.680
*wheezes*

44:16.054 --> 44:17.954
Paul, what?

44:18.390 --> 44:19.956
*wheezes*

44:23.828 --> 44:26.796
*mumbles* Horse-

44:29.801 --> 44:31.334
Horse, what?

44:31.336 --> 44:33.403
*moans*

44:33.405 --> 44:36.439
What are you trying to say?

44:37.275 --> 44:39.876
*wheezes*

44:47.452 --> 44:49.318
Paul?

44:54.926 --> 44:56.225
Horseshoe.

44:57.696 --> 44:59.195
He has a

44:59.197 --> 45:02.298
a horseshoe burn on his hand.

45:02.300 --> 45:05.702
I saw it when you
tore his glove off.

45:05.704 --> 45:07.737
Oh my god.

45:08.773 --> 45:10.907
Paul was trying to tell us.

45:10.909 --> 45:15.078
There's spiders. Worms next?

45:17.415 --> 45:19.182
I know you.

45:20.485 --> 45:24.754
I fucking know you.

45:24.756 --> 45:28.257
*eerie music plays*

45:28.259 --> 45:30.326
After the farmer's wife died

45:31.362 --> 45:32.962
he went crazy.

45:34.065 --> 45:36.899
Started wearing a pig skin mask.

45:36.901 --> 45:39.469
Locked his kid in the old
farmhouse.

45:39.471 --> 45:42.038
Didn't let him out of his sight.

45:42.040 --> 45:44.841
Made him eat the pigs alive

45:45.510 --> 45:48.211
and then one night,

45:48.213 --> 45:50.213
when the sky was at its blackest

45:50.215 --> 45:55.084
the old man sharpened his axe
until it was ripe for scalping.

45:55.086 --> 45:56.853
The kid was hiding.

45:56.855 --> 45:59.522
All he could hear were his
footsteps.

45:59.524 --> 46:03.126
Louder and louder, closer and
closer.

46:03.128 --> 46:04.527
*sighs*

46:04.529 --> 46:06.863
Police found what was left of
the kid

46:06.865 --> 46:08.931
in the scalding chamber.

46:09.467 --> 46:11.234
Skinless.

46:11.236 --> 46:16.239
And they say the farmer
still stalks these woods

46:16.241 --> 46:19.475
looking for his next victim...

46:20.311 --> 46:22.378
*laughs*

46:23.481 --> 46:25.248
It's not true.

46:25.250 --> 46:28.317
Is so. Creepy farmer.

46:28.319 --> 46:29.786
Stuff of legend.

46:29.788 --> 46:32.255
I'd kill that crazy freak.

46:32.257 --> 46:33.556
*burning fireplace*

46:33.558 --> 46:36.058
I don't think I could.

46:36.060 --> 46:37.093
Think about it.

46:38.229 --> 46:40.563
Actually ending a dude's life.

46:42.567 --> 46:44.834
Let's go find the farmhouse.

46:44.836 --> 46:46.903
*burning fireplace*

46:50.141 --> 46:51.808
What's that?

46:58.016 --> 47:01.484
*cracking coming from the wood*รก

47:07.091 --> 47:08.991
*gasps* Shit!

47:20.205 --> 47:21.938
*screams*

47:28.279 --> 47:29.478
Dominic, the boy.

47:29.480 --> 47:31.280
What the fuck are
you talking about?

47:31.282 --> 47:32.849
The traveller, Kat.

47:32.851 --> 47:36.586
The one with the horseshoe
burned on the back of his hand.

47:36.588 --> 47:39.322
It was my family summer
vacation.

47:40.158 --> 47:41.624
Holy shit.

47:41.626 --> 47:47.530
*footsteps*

47:47.532 --> 47:50.333
Hey. He's still following us.

47:50.335 --> 47:54.503
*footsteps*

47:56.374 --> 47:58.274
Hey, what's that scar?

48:02.647 --> 48:03.412
Whoa.

48:03.414 --> 48:04.547
Looks like a wiener.

48:04.549 --> 48:06.416
*laughs* Yeah.

48:06.417 --> 48:08.284
Wiener fingers doesn't
say much, does he?

48:09.654 --> 48:11.921
Say Adam's a fucking asshole.

48:14.993 --> 48:16.525
Adam's a fucking asshole.

48:16.527 --> 48:18.594
*laughs*

48:18.596 --> 48:20.897
So. Horseshoe.

48:20.899 --> 48:22.899
You wanna hang with us?

48:22.901 --> 48:27.403
*footsteps*

48:27.405 --> 48:28.471
You could replace .

48:28.473 --> 48:30.473
*shouting* Yah!

48:30.475 --> 48:32.541
*laughs*

48:34.012 --> 48:35.444
What's your name?

48:38.049 --> 48:39.181
Dominic.

48:39.183 --> 48:41.150
Well, you can be in our gang.

48:41.152 --> 48:42.585
*running water*

48:42.587 --> 48:44.654
Just needs to pass the dare.

48:46.224 --> 48:49.558

48:51.462 --> 48:54.297
*gasps*

49:16.254 --> 49:18.521

49:18.523 --> 49:19.422
Stop.

49:21.326 --> 49:25.628
*whimpers*

49:29.467 --> 49:32.234
Oh shit! Did you swallow that?

49:33.571 --> 49:34.403
Ugh.

49:42.981 --> 49:48.551
*whimpers*

49:53.591 --> 49:58.995
*screams*

50:01.632 --> 50:07.737

51:15.540 --> 51:17.640
Don't let them
get in your eye.

51:17.642 --> 51:19.642
They'll eat your brain.

51:19.644 --> 51:21.710
*groans*

51:23.614 --> 51:26.115
Actually, let's leave him.

51:26.117 --> 51:28.150
*eerie music plays*

51:29.320 --> 51:30.286
Leave him?

51:30.288 --> 51:33.155
*footsteps*

51:40.364 --> 51:42.364
Oh, fuck.

51:42.366 --> 51:44.400
We left him in that
creepy farmhouse.

51:44.402 --> 51:49.271
He's done all this 'cause he was
in some house for a moment? Come
on.

51:49.273 --> 51:51.140
It was more than a moment.

51:51.142 --> 51:54.877
I don't wanna him back here,
okay, he can stay out for ever!

51:54.879 --> 51:56.496
*scremas*

51:56.497 --> 51:58.114
Get, boy. You get
before I beat you!

51:58.116 --> 52:04.286
Stop it! No, don't say
that! Stop it! No!

52:04.288 --> 52:05.654
What you say to me?

52:05.656 --> 52:08.791
*screams & cries*

52:08.793 --> 52:12.361
*footsteps*

52:17.502 --> 52:19.535
Someone's in trouble.

52:21.339 --> 52:25.541
*chimes clanking*

52:28.412 --> 52:31.514
I did it after they
shot my horse.

52:31.516 --> 52:34.550
*chimes clanking*

52:34.552 --> 52:36.619
He was my best friend.

52:38.189 --> 52:40.823
I've got something really
cool to show you.

52:40.825 --> 52:42.591
Don't worry, it's just us.

52:48.866 --> 52:53.769
*chimes clanking*

53:03.948 --> 53:08.651
*footsteps*

53:18.596 --> 53:20.596
I'm sorry but...

53:20.598 --> 53:22.464
this really is the final dare.

53:22.466 --> 53:26.835
Look, all you have to
do is just go inside.

53:27.605 --> 53:28.971
I'll kiss if you do it.

53:28.973 --> 53:32.274
Show us how brave you
travel kids really are.

53:33.444 --> 53:36.779
You wanna kiss me, right?
Then go inside.

53:36.781 --> 53:37.746
20 minutes.

53:37.748 --> 53:39.748
Make it 20 years.

53:39.750 --> 53:41.817
*laughs*

53:43.487 --> 53:46.789
*footsteps*

54:01.005 --> 54:02.004
No wait!

54:02.006 --> 54:03.872
*door slams*

54:03.874 --> 54:05.307
Shit!

54:05.309 --> 54:07.376
*running*

54:12.917 --> 54:16.785
*screams*

54:16.787 --> 54:18.854
I went home that afternoon.

54:20.491 --> 54:22.758
I never thought I'd
see you guys again.

54:23.894 --> 54:26.695
Did anyone see
him after? The kid?

54:26.697 --> 54:28.831
My mom. She said ..

54:28.833 --> 54:30.866
don't go into
that farmhouse.

54:30.868 --> 54:32.601
She'd known I was there.

54:32.603 --> 54:34.470
What month were
we at the camp?

54:34.472 --> 54:36.605
My thirteenth birthday.

54:36.607 --> 54:37.873
August 25th.

54:37.875 --> 54:39.975
I had that big
meeting tomorrow.

54:40.711 --> 54:42.278
It was the 24th.

54:43.014 --> 54:44.580
That's 20 years.

54:44.582 --> 54:46.749
We were kids, we didn't
know any better.

54:47.451 --> 54:49.285
Neither does he.

54:49.287 --> 54:51.920
*sub bass drop*

54:51.922 --> 54:53.989

*hammer slam*

55:40.071 --> 55:41.570
Why aren't you working?

55:42.106 --> 55:44.340
I heard a noise.

55:44.342 --> 55:46.342
Bullshit.

Oh sorry.

56:04.895 --> 56:06.929

58:33.811 --> 58:34.576
Okay.

58:36.247 --> 58:39.047
Ahh!

*footsteps*

58:48.626 --> 58:51.026

58:53.230 --> 58:56.031
Ahh! I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

58:56.033 --> 58:57.065
Ah!

58:58.802 --> 59:00.869
*grunts*

59:00.871 --> 59:03.805
No, don't! You, you had a son.

59:03.807 --> 59:07.609
Henry. Are you gonna kill me

59:07.611 --> 59:09.211
just like you killed him?

59:10.781 --> 59:13.482
I didn't kill him.

59:13.483 --> 59:16.184
It was an accident in the
scalding
chamber, he wasn't strong
enough.

59:16.186 --> 59:18.954
You took me to replace him.

59:19.823 --> 59:21.490
Didn't you?

59:21.491 --> 59:23.158
I just wanted you to
be stronger, huh?

59:23.761 --> 59:25.160
I hate you.

59:25.162 --> 59:29.197
You wouldn't last five minutes
out there without me.

59:30.901 --> 59:33.135
No one loves you like I do.

59:33.137 --> 59:36.672
*eerie music plays*

59:36.674 --> 59:38.740
How do you love me?

59:40.010 --> 59:42.044
That scum outside?

59:42.046 --> 59:45.881
They're burning marks in your
skin.
Leaving you to rot.

59:45.883 --> 59:48.350
Well, surely they're a
better scum than you.

59:50.020 --> 59:52.321

1:00:30.728 --> 1:00:32.160
I'm sorry.

1:00:32.162 --> 1:00:34.730
I didn't mean
what I said before.

1:00:34.732 --> 1:00:37.399
No wonder no one
came looking for you.

1:00:40.070 --> 1:00:42.771
*chains clanking*

1:00:42.773 --> 1:00:47.676
What are you doing?
Wait! Wait! No, stop! Stop!

1:00:47.678 --> 1:00:49.711
How can I let you live?

1:00:49.713 --> 1:00:51.680
A fraud in Henry's home.

1:00:51.682 --> 1:00:53.649
Please, please don't,
please don't!

1:00:53.651 --> 1:00:54.950
Ahh! Ahh!

1:00:54.952 --> 1:00:56.952
Oh god, oh, stop!

1:00:56.954 --> 1:00:59.988
Tried to remove the evil ..

1:00:59.990 --> 1:01:01.289
to make you strong!

1:01:01.291 --> 1:01:03.759
No! Oh god, please!
Please, please no!

1:01:03.761 --> 1:01:05.861
Father, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

1:01:05.863 --> 1:01:07.863
But it doesn't leave everyone.

1:01:07.865 --> 1:01:10.699
*panting*

1:01:10.701 --> 1:01:13.101
Sorry, please! Let me go!

1:01:13.103 --> 1:01:14.703
No, no, no!

1:01:14.705 --> 1:01:18.707
Agh! Please no, stop!
Ah! Oh god! Ah!

1:01:18.709 --> 1:01:21.076

1:01:58.382 --> 1:01:59.448
Henry.

1:02:00.084 --> 1:02:01.416
It's Dominic.

1:02:01.418 --> 1:02:05.353
My parents were
looking for me.

1:02:05.355 --> 1:02:07.756
You burned them alive.

1:02:07.758 --> 1:02:10.892
*liquid bubbling*

1:02:12.029 --> 1:02:13.762
I love you, son.

1:02:13.764 --> 1:02:16.498
You already killed your son.

1:02:16.500 --> 1:02:18.767
*chains clanking*

1:02:19.870 --> 1:02:24.806

1:03:02.279 --> 1:03:05.247
I need to tell ya a secret.

1:03:05.249 --> 1:03:10.418
The only way you'll ever truly
be free is if you find them.

1:03:10.420 --> 1:03:13.255
Those that abandoned you.

1:03:13.257 --> 1:03:18.393
When you're big and strong,
no matter how long it takes

1:03:18.395 --> 1:03:24.099
no matter how hard you look,
bring them back here

1:03:24.101 --> 1:03:26.968
and let the evil out.

1:03:26.970 --> 1:03:30.972

1:03:49.459 --> 1:03:53.295

1:03:54.598 --> 1:03:56.198
We need to apologize.

1:03:56.200 --> 1:03:57.866
For what?

1:03:57.868 --> 1:04:00.035
We only knew each other
two fucking days.

1:04:00.037 --> 1:04:01.069
At most.

1:04:01.071 --> 1:04:03.522
Think about it.

1:04:03.523 --> 1:04:05.974
When kids get bullied, who do
they want to like 'em more than
anyone else?

1:04:06.343 --> 1:04:07.375
*laughs*

1:04:07.377 --> 1:04:09.511
What a nicer place to make
friends.

1:04:09.513 --> 1:04:11.079
Ah, think about it.

1:04:11.081 --> 1:04:13.315
If we can tap into even just a

1:04:13.317 --> 1:04:17.385
chink of humanity in that fucked
up head of his.

1:04:17.387 --> 1:04:19.087
And do what? Just let us go?

1:04:19.089 --> 1:04:20.322
Better the devil you know.

1:04:20.324 --> 1:04:21.056
Exactly.

1:04:21.058 --> 1:04:22.390
Jesus Christ.

1:04:22.392 --> 1:04:24.392
Fuck you, I'm getting outta
here.

1:04:24.394 --> 1:04:26.995
*chains clanking*

1:04:26.997 --> 1:04:30.532
Alright. Huh. Dominic.

1:04:34.638 --> 1:04:37.138
*shouting* Dominic!

1:05:10.674 --> 1:05:12.140
No.

1:05:13.176 --> 1:05:14.676
Dominic.

1:05:14.678 --> 1:05:16.578
Now we know who you are.

1:05:17.314 --> 1:05:19.481
And we know what we did.

1:05:21.184 --> 1:05:24.552
It was wrong to leave you.

1:05:24.554 --> 1:05:29.925
Now, I can't claim to know or...

1:05:29.927 --> 1:05:31.293
or where to understand

1:05:31.295 --> 1:05:32.961
I can't.

1:05:32.962 --> 1:05:34.628
What you've been going
through in the past

1:05:35.365 --> 1:05:37.032
the past 20 years.

1:05:38.669 --> 1:05:40.235
What I do know

1:05:41.071 --> 1:05:43.038
is that each one of us

1:05:43.573 --> 1:05:44.506
is sorry.

1:05:44.508 --> 1:05:45.440
*snarls* Huh?

1:05:45.442 --> 1:05:48.610
We're so sorry.

1:05:48.612 --> 1:05:54.416
We wanna get out of here, we do,
man.
We wanna get out of here with
you.

1:05:54.418 --> 1:05:58.453

1:06:24.014 --> 1:06:25.380

1:06:29.720 --> 1:06:31.419

1:10:49.746 --> 1:10:51.312
Oh god no! *sobs*

1:10:51.314 --> 1:10:54.782
*screams* No! Please! Please no!

1:10:54.784 --> 1:10:56.884
*grunts*

1:10:56.886 --> 1:10:59.687
No, no!

1:10:59.689 --> 1:11:01.756
*moans*

1:11:02.659 --> 1:11:04.792
*screams* No!

1:11:04.794 --> 1:11:06.861
*sobs*

1:11:07.931 --> 1:11:10.798
*screams*

1:11:22.012 --> 1:11:24.045
*sobs* No please!

1:11:25.315 --> 1:11:27.515
*sobs* I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1:11:28.618 --> 1:11:32.954
No! *screams*

1:11:35.058 --> 1:11:37.492
*cries*

1:11:42.032 --> 1:11:43.031
*knife pulled*

1:11:44.367 --> 1:11:45.833
Hey asshole!

1:11:46.703 --> 1:11:47.468
That's right.

1:11:47.470 --> 1:11:50.371
*grunts*

1:11:50.373 --> 1:11:53.608
*chains clanking*

1:11:53.610 --> 1:11:55.677
No wonder we left you to rot.

1:11:55.679 --> 1:11:57.445
*chokes*

1:11:57.447 --> 1:12:00.682
Look at you. A girl wouldn't
kiss you to save her life.

1:12:00.684 --> 1:12:04.385
You're nothing but
a waste of skin.

1:12:04.387 --> 1:12:08.556
Leaving you was the best thing
we ever fucking did, you fucking
freak!

1:12:08.558 --> 1:12:09.757
I'll kiss you then.

1:12:11.761 --> 1:12:14.762
*chokes*

1:12:16.833 --> 1:12:18.499
No one will ever love you.

1:12:18.501 --> 1:12:20.768
All you have to do
is just go inside.

1:12:20.770 --> 1:12:22.670
*screams*

1:12:22.671 --> 1:12:24.571
Your mother and father are scum.
They abandoned you....

1:12:24.574 --> 1:12:26.341
I'm your father now.

1:12:26.343 --> 1:12:27.342
No one...

1:12:27.344 --> 1:12:29.944
*whimpers*

1:12:31.614 --> 1:12:33.414
*chains clanking*

1:12:34.984 --> 1:12:36.050
*cell door closes*

1:12:36.052 --> 1:12:37.552
*screams*

1:12:37.554 --> 1:12:39.620
Get it out!

1:12:40.490 --> 1:12:41.556
Cut me loose.

1:12:41.558 --> 1:12:44.959
*groans*

1:12:46.796 --> 1:12:48.396
*screams* Get it out, oh shit!

1:12:48.398 --> 1:12:50.398
Has it gone inside?

1:12:50.400 --> 1:12:52.734
Oh shit, you gotta
pull it out!

1:12:52.736 --> 1:12:53.434
What?

1:12:53.436 --> 1:12:55.069
*sobs*

1:12:55.071 --> 1:12:57.739
Pull it out! Don't let me die.

1:12:57.741 --> 1:12:59.808
*screaming* Don't let me die!

1:12:59.809 --> 1:13:01.876
I'm not gonna let you die, I'm
not gonna let you die. Wait,
bite down.

1:13:01.878 --> 1:13:03.578
Right down. Hold him down.

1:13:03.580 --> 1:13:05.646
Ahh!

1:13:07.384 --> 1:13:09.550
*screams*

1:13:09.552 --> 1:13:13.388
*shouts & cries*

1:13:13.957 --> 1:13:18.926
*screams*

1:13:18.928 --> 1:13:22.730

1:13:30.173 --> 1:13:36.944
*heavy breathing*

1:13:40.517 --> 1:13:44.986
*heavy hits on metal*

1:13:45.955 --> 1:13:50.625
*metal slamming*

1:13:52.195 --> 1:13:54.462
*hits on wall*

1:13:56.499 --> 1:13:59.734
*paper torn apart*

1:14:00.703 --> 1:14:04.071
*shouts & slams*

1:14:06.476 --> 1:14:09.811

1:14:09.813 --> 1:14:13.181
*sobs*

1:14:19.956 --> 1:14:21.088
*fly buzzes*

1:14:22.125 --> 1:14:23.624
*cell door opens*

1:14:23.626 --> 1:14:25.927
*sobs* Fuck, you gotta hear me.

1:14:25.929 --> 1:14:28.029
Alright this it okay, he's
gonna come for us.

1:14:28.031 --> 1:14:29.230
We've got nothing to lose.

1:14:29.232 --> 1:14:31.098
Just one other fucking eye.

1:14:31.835 --> 1:14:34.535
Oh, he's gonna kill me.

1:14:34.537 --> 1:14:38.940
Oh god, it's fine, you're
gonna fucking kill me.

1:14:41.177 --> 1:14:44.812
It's best you hand over the
knife.
I need it more than you.

1:14:46.015 --> 1:14:48.249
I gotta protect myself!

1:14:48.251 --> 1:14:49.750
You're braver than me.

1:14:49.752 --> 1:14:51.152
No one's gonna get hurt anymore.

1:14:51.154 --> 1:14:53.821
That's easy for you to say,
you got the fucking knife!

1:14:53.823 --> 1:14:55.006
Give it!

1:14:55.007 --> 1:14:56.190
No, Adam. Adam, come on.

1:14:56.192 --> 1:14:57.825
*grunts*

1:15:03.266 --> 1:15:05.032
Don't. Don't.

1:15:05.034 --> 1:15:08.936
Stop it! Stop it!

1:15:08.938 --> 1:15:10.671
*grunts*

1:15:10.673 --> 1:15:11.539
Stop!
*grunts*

1:15:11.541 --> 1:15:12.740
Stop!

1:15:13.943 --> 1:15:18.613
*chokes*

1:15:23.286 --> 1:15:23.951
Adam.

1:15:23.953 --> 1:15:27.154
*chokes*

1:15:27.156 --> 1:15:29.223
*grunts*

1:15:48.711 --> 1:15:51.679
*panting*

1:15:52.615 --> 1:15:54.582
Kat, it's not your fault.

1:15:54.584 --> 1:15:57.118
Kat, repeat after me,
"It wasn't my fault."

1:16:00.723 --> 1:16:02.290
Maybe it was my fault.

1:16:02.859 --> 1:16:04.158
All of it.

1:16:05.728 --> 1:16:06.961
I never went back.

1:16:08.064 --> 1:16:10.565
I never checked to
see if he was okay.

1:16:10.567 --> 1:16:14.869
After you left, the police came.

1:16:14.871 --> 1:16:18.906
Asking all kinds of shit
about a missing boy.

1:16:18.908 --> 1:16:21.576
And you know what I told them?

1:16:21.578 --> 1:16:24.211
Fucking zero.

1:16:24.213 --> 1:16:26.814
All this time you knew?

1:16:26.816 --> 1:16:28.616
20 years.

1:16:28.618 --> 1:16:32.219
20 fucking years I held onto
this shit and for what?

1:16:33.790 --> 1:16:35.356
You left him too.

1:16:37.026 --> 1:16:38.993
You could have saved him.

1:16:38.995 --> 1:16:42.196
You could have told someone.

1:16:43.333 --> 1:16:45.700
You could have stopped this.

1:16:45.702 --> 1:16:49.070
*panic breathing*

1:16:49.072 --> 1:16:50.204
Let her go.

1:16:51.207 --> 1:16:53.374
We just wanna go home.

1:16:53.376 --> 1:16:56.043
I returned to your world after.

1:16:59.949 --> 1:17:02.216
Still no family.

1:17:02.218 --> 1:17:04.051
You're a good kid, Dominic.

1:17:04.053 --> 1:17:07.288
No. I was still unwanted.

1:17:07.890 --> 1:17:09.290
An orphan.

1:17:10.793 --> 1:17:14.161
Came back here.
The farmer was right.

1:17:14.163 --> 1:17:15.896
You are all scum!

1:17:15.898 --> 1:17:17.131
You were my friend.

1:17:17.133 --> 1:17:17.999
No.

1:17:18.935 --> 1:17:20.234
You abandoned me.

1:17:20.236 --> 1:17:22.737
Left me for dead.

1:17:22.739 --> 1:17:26.774
*panting*

1:17:26.776 --> 1:17:28.776
Why don't you let
me see that face?

1:17:28.778 --> 1:17:31.178
*whimpers*

1:17:36.686 --> 1:17:38.019
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1:17:38.021 --> 1:17:40.755
Let me see, my friend.

1:17:40.757 --> 1:17:45.259
*soft breathing*

1:17:49.265 --> 1:17:51.165
*whimpers*

1:17:58.374 --> 1:18:00.307
See that wasn't so hard.

1:18:02.412 --> 1:18:06.447
I would have come and rescued
you if I'd known what you were
going through.

1:18:07.316 --> 1:18:10.317
*soft breathing*

1:18:13.222 --> 1:18:15.389
*sobs*

1:18:31.908 --> 1:18:32.473
Ahh!

1:19:16.853 --> 1:19:19.920
*gasps*

1:19:19.922 --> 1:19:21.155
I failed.

1:19:23.893 --> 1:19:26.227
The evil never left you.

1:19:27.296 --> 1:19:28.796
*knife clanking*

1:19:35.171 --> 1:19:38.339
*gasps*

1:19:38.908 --> 1:19:40.341
Kill me.

1:19:53.923 --> 1:19:55.990

1:19:55.992 --> 1:19:59.527
Look at you. You're pathetic.

1:19:59.529 --> 1:20:01.295
*grunts*

1:20:01.297 --> 1:20:03.364

1:25:56.685 --> 1:25:59.219
*whispers* I can't.

1:25:59.221 --> 1:26:00.721
*shouting* Do it!

1:26:00.723 --> 1:26:02.723
Aah!

1:26:02.725 --> 1:26:04.725
*panting*

1:26:04.727 --> 1:26:06.793
Your wife. I'll take her.

1:26:06.795 --> 1:26:09.429
She'll suffer worse than you.

1:26:10.432 --> 1:26:11.565
Look at me.

1:26:12.701 --> 1:26:14.168
Ahh!

1:26:15.638 --> 1:26:17.838
Your daughters will live with
me.

1:26:18.474 --> 1:26:19.740
*chokes*

1:26:19.742 --> 1:26:21.742
I will make them love me.

1:26:21.744 --> 1:26:23.810
*ckoes*

1:26:32.254 --> 1:26:33.253
Huah!

1:26:33.255 --> 1:26:35.322
*choking*

1:26:36.392 --> 1:26:38.525
Gah!

1:26:38.527 --> 1:26:40.594
*gasps*

1:26:43.632 --> 1:26:46.333
*chokes*

1:26:54.376 --> 1:26:58.812

1:26:58.814 --> 1:27:00.881
*dramatic music plays*

1:27:11.627 --> 1:27:13.760
*grunts*

1:27:13.762 --> 1:27:17.798
*footsteps*

1:27:22.471 --> 1:27:26.273

1:27:29.712 --> 1:27:31.878
*car engine growls*

1:27:43.692 --> 1:27:46.526
*car door opens*

1:27:50.933 --> 1:27:53.033
*house door squeaks*

1:27:58.607 --> 1:28:00.474
*car door closes*

1:28:01.777 --> 1:28:05.912
*footsteps*

1:28:07.683 --> 1:28:09.283
Jay!

1:28:12.755 --> 1:28:13.787
Jay!

1:28:13.789 --> 1:28:15.856
*sobs*

1:28:16.492 --> 1:28:18.859
*cries*

1:28:18.861 --> 1:28:20.594
Oh my god!

1:28:20.596 --> 1:28:21.995
I'll live.

1:28:21.997 --> 1:28:24.064
*gasps*

1:28:25.034 --> 1:28:26.833
Daddy?

1:28:26.835 --> 1:28:28.602
*sobs*

1:28:28.604 --> 1:28:30.604
Molly. Poppy.

1:28:30.606 --> 1:28:32.673
*running*

1:28:37.046 --> 1:28:38.879
What's wrong with your face?

1:28:38.881 --> 1:28:40.380
*sobs*

1:28:40.382 --> 1:28:42.883
Daddy's gonna be okay.
Alright?

1:28:45.654 --> 1:28:52.793
*eerie music plays*

1:29:00.969 --> 1:29:02.502

1:29:04.573 --> 1:29:08.475

1:29:19.988 --> 1:29:21.488
*snow hits body*

1:29:21.490 --> 1:29:22.055
*laughs*

1:29:29.631 --> 1:29:31.565
*kisses*

1:29:33.502 --> 1:29:35.736
Dad would kill us if
he knew we were here.

1:29:36.672 --> 1:29:37.537
Dude...

1:29:37.539 --> 1:29:39.239
*sighs*

1:29:39.240 --> 1:29:40.940
Dad will never know.
Besides, the freak's long gone.

1:29:40.943 --> 1:29:43.543
D-E-A-D. Fucked.

1:29:44.413 --> 1:29:46.180
I hate dares.

1:29:46.181 --> 1:29:47.948
Well then, you should
have chosen truth instead.

1:29:47.950 --> 1:29:52.119
And you and Isaac could have
stayed
at home like little virgin
snowflakes.

1:29:54.156 --> 1:29:55.722
*laughs*

1:29:55.724 --> 1:29:57.724
Is it really the same forest?

1:29:57.726 --> 1:30:00.160
Yeah. Not far from here.

1:30:00.162 --> 1:30:01.795
Your dad kicked his ass, right?

1:30:01.797 --> 1:30:05.432
Hells, yeah. Ten years ago
tonight.

1:30:06.001 --> 1:30:07.667
No, I get it.

1:30:07.669 --> 1:30:10.404
*fireplace burning*

1:30:10.406 --> 1:30:12.472
Freak fed him cockroaches.

1:30:12.474 --> 1:30:15.409
Made them slice each other.

1:30:15.411 --> 1:30:17.110
Nailed them to the wall.

1:30:17.112 --> 1:30:20.547
He even kept their skin.

1:30:21.683 --> 1:30:23.483
But that's not all.

1:30:23.485 --> 1:30:26.820
Dude, pinned one of the
prisoners down and...

1:30:26.822 --> 1:30:28.755
Got him with the worms!

1:30:28.757 --> 1:30:29.189
*laughs*

1:30:29.191 --> 1:30:31.691
Poppy! Oh.

1:30:31.693 --> 1:30:34.461
*laughs*

1:30:35.831 --> 1:30:36.863
So.

1:30:36.865 --> 1:30:40.167
Who's coming with me to find the
farmhouse?

1:30:40.169 --> 1:30:41.001
Yeah, I'm game.

1:30:41.003 --> 1:30:41.868
Yeah?

1:30:41.870 --> 1:30:43.537
No, no way.

1:30:43.539 --> 1:30:45.539
You know they never found a
body.

1:30:45.541 --> 1:30:46.440
What?

1:30:47.042 --> 1:30:47.974
Oh shit.

1:30:49.711 --> 1:30:50.911
Yo.

1:30:50.913 --> 1:30:53.747
I'm gonna go grab my
gloves from the car.

1:30:53.749 --> 1:30:55.482
It's freezing out here, man.

1:30:55.484 --> 1:30:57.551
*footseps*

1:30:58.654 --> 1:31:00.487

1:31:00.489 --> 1:31:04.024
*fireplace burning*

1:31:06.061 --> 1:31:08.228
Yo. Fuck this, come on guys.

1:31:10.699 --> 1:31:13.233
Come on, I'll, I'll bring
the car around.

1:31:13.235 --> 1:31:19.072
*footsteps*

1:31:19.074 --> 1:31:21.475
We should go.

1:31:21.477 --> 1:31:24.578
*fireplace burning*

1:31:24.580 --> 1:31:26.146
Pussies.

1:31:26.815 --> 1:31:29.082
Poppy, come on!

1:31:30.953 --> 1:31:39.759
*eerie music plays*
