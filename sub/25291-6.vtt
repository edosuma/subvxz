WEBVTT

00:47.160 --> 00:50.345
R055: Dearest Deme/za,
I feel your absence keen/y.

00:50.520 --> 00:56.299
Yet I rely upon your wonden‘u/ resourcefulness
to keep the home ﬁres ablaze W I return.

00:56.480 --> 01:01.224
My dearest Ross, mind I don't blaze you
if ever you deign to come home again!

01:09.760 --> 01:11.739
(Birdsong)

01:14.080 --> 01:16.059
Where shall we dine?

01:16.240 --> 01:18.504
I regret I have a prior engagement.

01:19.320 --> 01:21.299
Who dares take priority over me?

01:27.480 --> 01:29.220
Prime Minister.

01:29.400 --> 01:31.265
Captain Poldark.

01:31.440 --> 01:34.944
I'm glad to hear your Poor Relief scheme
succeeded in Cornwall.

01:35.120 --> 01:38.544
And I've every sympathy for a bill
to implement it across the nation.

01:38.720 --> 01:41.223
But it will not be passed.

01:41.400 --> 01:44.346
Why? Because too many of our Members
deem it in their interest

01:44.520 --> 01:46.147
to keep the "small man" in his place.

01:46.320 --> 01:50.984
Then I must ask myself why I became
a Member, if not to change that.

01:51.160 --> 01:54.106
Your impulse is sound
and I believe its time will come.

01:54.280 --> 01:57.067
- And in the meantime?
- Take care of those you can.

01:57.840 --> 02:00.149
Help those who cannot help themselves.

02:03.560 --> 02:06.199
- Your wife? Is she in London?
- In Truro.

02:06.360 --> 02:09.102
I rely on her to keep me appraised of
all that occurs in my absence.

02:09.280 --> 02:10.702
Does she ever visit?

02:11.480 --> 02:14.119
How could I bring her?
Who would manage Cornwall?

02:14.280 --> 02:15.304
(Chuckles)

02:15.480 --> 02:17.220
(Lively chatter)

02:18.920 --> 02:20.660
Forgive me, sir.

02:20.840 --> 02:23.786
Where might I find Dr Enys?
I've mislaid him these three weeks.

02:23.960 --> 02:26.702
Forgive me. I've been advising Dr Behenna
at the new infirmary.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.097
It opens in a fortnight.

02:28.280 --> 02:29.861
And between that and my patients...

02:30.040 --> 02:31.780
And tryin' not to think of Caroline?

02:31.960 --> 02:35.179
Oh, Caroline will insist on
invading my thoughts.

02:35.360 --> 02:37.737
Though not, alas, my home.

02:39.720 --> 02:41.699
(Bell rings)

02:45.280 --> 02:46.599
(Door opens)

02:51.520 --> 02:55.217
Nat Pearce...has croaked.

02:57.840 --> 02:59.819
How tragic.

03:06.360 --> 03:09.386
Foolish, foolish old man.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.186
Is it true, Father?

03:16.360 --> 03:19.579
He stole money from his clients' funds
and gambled it away?

03:19.760 --> 03:22.103
Not gambled. Speculated.

03:22.280 --> 03:25.340
Though some might say it's the same thing,
since the money was lost.

03:25.520 --> 03:30.389
- Could you not have prevented him?
- By the time I found out, the damage was done.

03:30.560 --> 03:33.347
But Pasc0e's Bank stands guarantor
for those funds

03:33.520 --> 03:35.465
and I intend to honour them in full.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.979
- Can you?
- We'll be somewhat pinched,

03:38.160 --> 03:40.663
_ but if no other strain
IS placed on our resources...

03:40.840 --> 03:42.944
Ah, there you are, wife.

03:43.120 --> 03:44.337
Father-in-law.

03:47.360 --> 03:51.626
Mm. Deuced glad I trusted him
with none of my capital.

03:51.800 --> 03:54.143
I hope you're keeping it safe, sir.

03:54.320 --> 03:58.063
Rest assured, St John, your entire
marriage settlement remains untouched.

04:03.960 --> 04:05.348
(Music, chatter and laughter)

04:05.520 --> 04:07.897
CAROLINE:
"Help those who cannot help themselves"?

04:08.840 --> 04:12.424
_ At least it's a mission_.
Since you cannot bear to be wrthout one.

04:14.440 --> 04:15.907
Is that how you see me?

04:16.080 --> 04:19.504
My dear, you must always be
about some scheme or another.

04:19.680 --> 04:21.944
When do you ever stand by and do nothing?

04:22.640 --> 04:24.619
- (Cheering)
- Drink up, Poldark.

04:28.200 --> 04:29.622
Oh, go on!

04:29.800 --> 04:33.577
He would hardly thank me
for showing him up in front of his friends.

04:47.920 --> 04:50.559
MEN: Ohh!
- on.

04:52.160 --> 04:54.139
Oh, shame on you, Poldark.

04:54.320 --> 04:57.983
Kitty will be disappointed
if you cannot stand to attention.

04:58.520 --> 05:00.499
(Laughter)

05:17.880 --> 05:19.984
A brace of Poldarks.

05:20.160 --> 05:22.617
Quel embarras de richesses.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.381
We were just leaving.

05:24.560 --> 05:26.425
Deserting your post?

05:26.600 --> 05:28.420
Is the pace too warm for your nephew?

05:28.600 --> 05:29.862
On the contrary.

05:30.040 --> 05:31.701
I think he found it rather dull.

05:39.240 --> 05:44.462
To Nathaniel Pearce, Esquire,
and his most helpful demise.

05:44.640 --> 05:46.062
Mm.

05:46.240 --> 05:50.222
Perhaps now would be a good time
to resume your "literary career".

05:52.000 --> 05:53.979
With himself safely in the ground.

05:57.480 --> 06:00.620
GEORGE
It comes to the notice of a well-w/sner

06:00.800 --> 06:03.382
that you entrust your savings
to Pascoe/s Bank.

06:03.880 --> 06:06.826
I must inform you
it is on the verge of insolvency,

06:07.000 --> 06:13.257
owing to the crimma/ activities
of Pascoe is accomplice, Nathaniel Pearce,

06:13.440 --> 06:18.707
who has been permitted to embezzle
funds entrusted to him.

06:19.440 --> 06:24.980
I therefore advise you to withdraw your
deposits from Pascoe's Bank without delay.

06:26.280 --> 06:28.259
We will continue this later.

06:30.160 --> 06:32.139
(Clears his throat)

06:38.360 --> 06:40.942
- What was that letter?
- Oh, business.

06:41.600 --> 06:44.740
- Pertaining to Ross?
- Why would you think so?

06:44.920 --> 06:47.741
You've a particular expression
when conspiring against him.

06:47.920 --> 06:49.820
- (Laughs)
- I've seen it many times.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.787
I can assure you, there was
no mention of Ross in that letter.

06:54.480 --> 06:57.222
Yet I wonder
why you're so keen to protect him.

06:57.400 --> 06:59.618
It is you I'm keen to protect, George.

06:59.800 --> 07:03.463
From your own imaginings,
which have injured us both in the past.

07:04.760 --> 07:07.866
_ But on this_ occasion _
I see It was my Imagining, so forgive me.

07:08.920 --> 07:10.057
Hm.

07:18.520 --> 07:21.421
Does Adderley not know
who the boy's stepfather is?

07:22.160 --> 07:23.787
Do you think he cares?

07:23.960 --> 07:27.657
Still, I'm glad to see
you're resolved not to interfere.

07:29.720 --> 07:32.541
Perhaps we all need a little distance
from London.

07:34.960 --> 07:36.939
(Birdsong)

07:40.560 --> 07:42.778
JEREMY: This one's huge.
- Good boy.

07:43.840 --> 07:45.182
How many have you got?

07:45.360 --> 07:47.339
(Music drowns chatter)

07:54.680 --> 07:56.659
Yes! Well done.

08:00.080 --> 08:03.982
I thought 'ee should know, Mistress,
old Nat Pearce is dead.

08:04.720 --> 08:06.699
Oh.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.189
And...?

08:08.360 --> 08:11.944
Well, 'tis said he left his affairs in disarray.

08:12.120 --> 08:14.304
Talk of embezzlements and the like.

08:14.480 --> 08:17.620
- But Ross had no dealings with him.
- Pasc0e's Bank did.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.540
And now 'tis said there may be a crash

08:19.720 --> 08:22.939
and that Pascoe's be no longer a safe place
to keep money.

08:24.040 --> 08:26.019
Judas!

08:56.960 --> 08:58.780
I come again to ask 'ee.

08:58.960 --> 09:00.939
And my answer is the same.

09:01.400 --> 09:04.267
Thank 'ee kindly. But no.

09:08.200 --> 09:09.781
But why?

09:09.960 --> 09:11.939
There be no hope of resurrectin' this.

09:12.120 --> 09:13.906
So why not come and live with me in Sawle?

09:14.080 --> 09:17.379
Because I'd not disrespect Rosina
by showing my face there again.

09:18.320 --> 09:23.440
I'm minded to start afresh,
maybe 'list as a soldier or go to sea.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.860
Morwenna's dead to me.

09:27.040 --> 09:29.224
And I'll not injure Rosina more.

09:30.080 --> 09:33.538
So I'll see what may be salvaged 'ere
and then I'll be on my way.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.099
(Birdsong)

09:43.160 --> 09:45.139
I thank you. Leave me.

10:08.440 --> 10:10.419
(Footsteps approach)

10:14.320 --> 10:16.902
My dear, are you quite well?
You seem very pale.

10:17.080 --> 10:19.901
I believe I may be...
sickening for something.

10:24.640 --> 10:26.744
You must look after yourself, my dear.

10:38.920 --> 10:40.899
LADY WHITWORTH: Morwenna!

10:48.240 --> 10:50.822
My daughter-in-law had no business
to send for you.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.900
I cannot imagine
what she has to complain of.

10:53.080 --> 10:55.583
I'll be happy to ascertain that
if I might see her alone.

10:56.440 --> 10:58.419
She has no secrets from me.

11:04.200 --> 11:07.749
Then doubtless she'll give you a full account
once I've examined her.

11:17.640 --> 11:20.063
Your note mentioned tremors.

11:23.360 --> 11:25.339
Palpitations? Nausea?

11:31.120 --> 11:34.385
If you would furnish me more details,
I could perhaps prescribe...

11:34.560 --> 11:36.539
Oblivion?

11:38.320 --> 11:40.299
Can you supply that?

11:42.680 --> 11:44.181
Yes.

11:44.360 --> 11:47.261
But first I might ask
what you wish to escape.

11:49.400 --> 11:52.585
I might also tell you that I myself
once wished for such a thing.

11:53.680 --> 11:58.800
When I returned from France, with my senses
numbed and my nerves frayed...

11:58.960 --> 12:00.939
And violated?

12:01.600 --> 12:03.784
As I have been violated.

12:05.880 --> 12:08.667
My husband, before he died...

12:08.840 --> 12:10.819
I understand.

12:11.200 --> 12:13.907
And I urge you to put all thoughts of him
behind you.

12:14.880 --> 12:18.145
Look to the future, with hope.

12:21.320 --> 12:23.299
I wish that were possible.

12:28.160 --> 12:30.139
God go with 'ee, maid.

12:30.400 --> 12:32.379
And thee, sir.

12:32.720 --> 12:34.540
Rosina...

12:37.560 --> 12:41.223
What passed 'twixt thee an' my brother,
I believe he did wrong.

12:42.480 --> 12:45.222
A promise is a promise,
and should not be broke on a whim.

12:46.240 --> 12:47.787
'Twas not a whim, sir.

12:48.320 --> 12:50.026
For he loved she afore he ever saw me

12:50.200 --> 12:53.021
and when she was widowed,
he felt he must go to her.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.259
So I respect him.

12:57.320 --> 12:59.299
I don't respect her.

13:00.160 --> 13:03.106
She's free now,
yet she've turned 'im away.

13:03.280 --> 13:05.657
If she truly loved 'im, why did she so?

13:07.560 --> 13:09.380
That I cannot answer.

13:09.560 --> 13:12.905
And perhaps I've no right
to speak to thee of Drake at all.

13:14.040 --> 13:15.667
But if 'ee'll allow me...

13:23.280 --> 13:25.703
R055:
Then there’s only one th/ng you can do.

13:25.880 --> 13:29.941
Which would put a seal on George's trust
which no-one could dispute.

13:32.080 --> 13:33.707
Give him another child.

13:34.640 --> 13:36.983
That cannot alter what's gone before.

13:37.160 --> 13:39.378
It could...

13:39.560 --> 13:42.779
if there were some confusion over the dates.

13:45.160 --> 13:48.266
If it could seem to him
another eight-month-child...

13:48.920 --> 13:50.899
Mama?

13:59.560 --> 14:00.879
Gentlemen, please.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.746
Gentlemen, have patience.

14:02.920 --> 14:04.945
I will see you all in turn.

14:05.120 --> 14:11.787
It's _true that some of the funds Nat Pearce
misappropriated carried our guarantee.

14:11.960 --> 14:14.667
They will be honoured in full.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.379
There's not the slightest threat
to the stability of the bank.

14:19.600 --> 14:25.664
Unless all of my old clients
proceed as you wish to do

14:25.840 --> 14:31.039
and suddenly withdraw, in full,
deposits which have lain with us for years.

14:34.800 --> 14:35.869
(Door opens)

14:36.040 --> 14:38.861
Mistress Poldark, what a pleasure.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.268
A glass of port?

14:41.440 --> 14:43.226
Thank you, no, sir.

14:43.400 --> 14:46.585
'Tis the end of the month, and as you know,
our usual custom...

14:46.760 --> 14:49.320
Is to draw money for wages.

14:49.920 --> 14:52.263
Of course. 500?

14:52.440 --> 14:53.987
I will instruct my clerk.

14:54.160 --> 14:57.857
But, sir, I bethink if you're in such trouble...

14:58.040 --> 15:01.100
You wish to safeguard yourself
by taking more?

15:01.280 --> 15:03.100
I quite understand.

15:03.280 --> 15:06.784
Captain Poldark has over
3,000 to his credit.

15:06.960 --> 15:11.021
_ But I'd esteem _it a favour
If you'd not take It all at once.

15:11.200 --> 15:14.499
In a week, I hope,
we will have weathered the storm.

15:26.600 --> 15:30.548
Yes, I did hear rumours of the crisis
at Pascoe's Bank.

15:30.720 --> 15:33.666
But...l assume it will blow over.

15:34.920 --> 15:38.026
Forgive me, my Lord,
I don't rightly understand these things,

15:38.200 --> 15:42.500
and dearly wish Ross were here to help,
but in his absence...

15:43.160 --> 15:46.220
It's the end of the month
and I went to draw money to pay our wages

15:46.400 --> 15:49.267
but I found I could not.

15:49.840 --> 15:53.788
- You mean Pasc0e's could not pay you?
- No, I mean I could not withdraw it.

15:54.680 --> 15:58.104
IfI do, 'twill encourage others
to do the same, and...

15:58.280 --> 16:01.067
Pascoe has been Ross's friend
these 20 years.

16:01.560 --> 16:05.144
Surely now is the time to put money in,
not draw it out.

16:14.960 --> 16:16.905
Your concern was not needed, Uncle.

16:17.080 --> 16:21.028
Everyone in London has their little amours,
everyone gambles and drinks to excess.

16:21.200 --> 16:23.145
On their stepfather's money?

16:23.320 --> 16:25.538
Why could you not have been my stepfather?

16:25.720 --> 16:29.144
I could never fund your education
or your escapades.

16:30.040 --> 16:32.099
I suggest you retain George's favour.

16:32.280 --> 16:34.305
Believe me, it's the only reason I tolerate him.

16:34.480 --> 16:36.459
(Ross and Geoffrey Charles chuckle)

16:38.960 --> 16:43.260
Well, 'tis not only advice I seek,
my Lord, but...

16:45.240 --> 16:47.379
...a loan.

16:47.560 --> 16:49.539
2,000. To meet our wages.

16:50.360 --> 16:52.100
How many men do you employ?

16:52.800 --> 16:55.826
Erm, I can't rightly remember.

16:56.360 --> 16:58.021
From conversations with your husband,

16:58.200 --> 17:03.069
I would guess that 800
would more than cover your needs.

17:14.040 --> 17:15.860
May I offer you a word of advice?

17:16.040 --> 17:22.024
Loyalty is admirable but it's unwise
to be governed by sentiment.

17:23.080 --> 17:26.379
This money is for you and your mine.

17:28.280 --> 17:30.840
Not to prop up a shaky bank in Truro.

17:31.600 --> 17:33.579
No, my Lord.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.779
I'm that grateful, my Lord.

17:48.560 --> 17:50.869
I wonder who his father would've preferred.

17:51.680 --> 17:53.784
- For his stepfather.
- Neither of us.

17:55.960 --> 17:59.782
George may be a moral bankrupt, but
I could never have made Elizabeth happy.

18:00.520 --> 18:03.546
She requires a life of ease and luxury.

18:04.360 --> 18:06.339
And you require?

18:07.200 --> 18:09.862
A wife who's willing to dirty her hands.

18:14.920 --> 18:16.899
(Lively chatter)

18:17.080 --> 18:19.059
(Raised voices)

18:22.320 --> 18:25.949
Excuse me, sirs,
where must I go to pay money in?

18:26.120 --> 18:27.906
Pardon me, sirs.

18:29.080 --> 18:31.059
Pray excuse me, sir.

18:31.480 --> 18:33.459
I 'ave money to pay in.

18:34.160 --> 18:35.661
Which way must I go?

18:35.840 --> 18:38.104
Good day, Mr Martin,
you're not here to withdraw funds?

18:38.280 --> 18:39.497
No, ma'am. Deposit.

18:39.680 --> 18:42.262
As I've done every month these 20 years.

18:42.440 --> 18:44.658
An' I, sir. 30 years.

18:44.840 --> 18:46.944
And 'ave no reason to stop now.

18:47.120 --> 18:49.577
I be new to these parts.

18:50.120 --> 18:52.099
And have been recommended?

18:52.880 --> 18:55.860
Oh, yeah, and have been recommended
to this bank

18:56.040 --> 18:59.783
on account of it bein', er...

19:03.080 --> 19:04.945
Safer than Bodmin Jail.

19:06.560 --> 19:08.425
For, once in, there's no gettin' out.

19:08.600 --> 19:11.580
And truly,
I declare I'd trust Pasc0e's with my life.

19:12.920 --> 19:14.581
(All talk at once)

19:21.960 --> 19:23.939
(Cry of seagulls)

19:34.440 --> 19:36.579
- I was only thinkin' of...
- What?

19:36.760 --> 19:40.139
That I'm so marr'd and dainty,
I can't abide to look at 'ee now?

19:40.880 --> 19:42.780
Or hear folks' gossip?

19:42.960 --> 19:46.703
"Poor Rosina, twice let down,
and maybe now she'll never wed."

19:52.040 --> 19:54.543
There be no words too wicked
for the wrong that I did 'ee.

19:54.720 --> 19:56.142
Hush yer creenin'.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.299
'Tis I was jilted, not thee.

19:59.080 --> 20:01.059
And if I can stay and bear it, so can 'ee.

20:18.480 --> 20:20.903
GEORGE: So Pascoe is clinging on.

20:21.080 --> 20:23.822
But are we to be thwarted
by a scullery maid?

20:24.000 --> 20:25.865
I think not.

20:34.920 --> 20:38.060
My dear St John, how good of you
to respond so promptly to our note.

20:38.240 --> 20:41.027
Concerning your outstanding loans with us.

20:41.560 --> 20:43.539
Which, of course, you're happy to renew?

20:44.280 --> 20:46.498
The season's been damned expensive.

20:46.680 --> 20:50.901
And as cousin to
the Honourable Member for Truro,

20:51.080 --> 20:54.345
I must look the part
if I'm to benefit from the association.

20:54.520 --> 20:56.340
Cousin? To Ross Poldark?

20:56.520 --> 20:58.420
Did we know that?

20:58.600 --> 21:03.424
Not wanting to be a killjoy...
but capital's scarce.

21:03.600 --> 21:08.583
Our bank lately financed several schemes
which ran into difﬁculties.

21:08.760 --> 21:11.581
Not unlike those which ruined Nat Pearce.

21:12.280 --> 21:18.742
So, regrettably, we find ourselves obliged
to call in a number of our short-term loans.

21:19.480 --> 21:21.107
Including yours.

21:21.680 --> 21:23.466
What?

21:24.720 --> 21:26.699
Gentlemen, this is a poor jest.

21:27.800 --> 21:29.984
But... But that's outrageous.

21:30.640 --> 21:33.427
You surely recall
how I chose to retain you as my bankers,

21:33.600 --> 21:35.739
even though my wife Joan
urged me to bank with her father.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.706
And this is how you repay me?

21:37.880 --> 21:41.304
And you'll recall your wife's dowry -
a considerable sum -

21:41.480 --> 21:43.300
still resides at her father's bank.

21:43.480 --> 21:45.425
I suggest you call upon it now.

21:45.600 --> 21:48.307
- I believe it will almost cover your debts.
- Mm.

21:48.480 --> 21:50.584
Preposterous. Disgraceful.

21:50.760 --> 21:55.629
I should add that this unfortunate situation
is temporary.

22:00.760 --> 22:04.218
Should you then apply to us for credit...

22:08.120 --> 22:10.224
Oh. Oh, I see.

22:11.520 --> 22:12.589
A mere three months?

22:12.760 --> 22:17.026
Though I beg you not to mention
our present difficulties,

22:17.200 --> 22:19.623
for fear it should frighten our investors.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.819
Of course.

22:25.880 --> 22:27.825
You can rely on my discretion.

22:42.080 --> 22:43.741
Ah, Dr Enys.

22:43.920 --> 22:45.979
How go the preparations
for the grand opening?

22:46.160 --> 22:47.263
Of the infirmary?

22:47.440 --> 22:50.546
Gratifying for we subscribers
to see the fruits of our labours.

22:50.720 --> 22:52.824
At any rate, the fruits of your donations.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.560
One cannot do _too much
for the deservmg poor.

22:56.040 --> 22:59.589
As you yourself demonstrate
by your generous support of Ross's scheme.

22:59.760 --> 23:03.264
Ah, yes, we are quite the charitable cabal.

23:03.440 --> 23:06.147
A pity his obligations in Westminster
keep him from Cornwall.

23:06.320 --> 23:09.266
So much afoot which he is sadly missing.

23:53.120 --> 23:54.747
Never learn, do 'ee?

23:54.920 --> 23:57.377
Brother Tom did say
'ee were a stubborn |i|' tacker.

23:57.560 --> 23:58.982
My brother do wish for no trouble.

23:59.160 --> 24:02.220
And yet it do always seem to find 'im.

24:03.600 --> 24:05.579
Ignore him. Come on.

24:20.400 --> 24:22.664
- Mama.
- My darling.

24:22.840 --> 24:25.422
- The prodigal returns.
- Is that me or you?

24:26.320 --> 24:29.539
- Will you take some refreshment?
- I assume George is from home?

24:31.680 --> 24:33.466
Thank you for taking him under your wing.

24:33.640 --> 24:36.302
- And for bringing him home.
- I was glad to do it.

24:39.960 --> 24:43.305
I've been informed by the Chief Clerk
at Pascoe's Bank

24:43.480 --> 24:45.903
they've closed their doors.

24:46.080 --> 24:48.503
No-one can withdraw money.

24:49.560 --> 24:54.680
Which means, for Ross,
his entire life savings.

24:56.960 --> 24:59.303
- Elizabeth should hear it from me.
- Mm.

25:05.240 --> 25:08.539
I'll be at the infirmary till late.
Tell Bone I'll take supper in my room.

25:08.720 --> 25:10.699
Yes, sir.

25:14.440 --> 25:16.419
Dr Enys?

25:18.520 --> 25:21.159
There's a terrible shortage
of good physicians in London.

25:21.320 --> 25:23.299
I was obliged to come to Cornwall to find one.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.220
And do you have an appointment?

25:28.160 --> 25:29.900
I'm afraid not.

25:30.080 --> 25:31.820
Do you think you might fit me in?

25:57.320 --> 25:59.299
(Driver urges on horses)

26:04.120 --> 26:05.667
R055: To our friendship.
- Yes.

26:07.160 --> 26:09.424
Though I doubt George
would approve of my visit.

26:11.240 --> 26:14.266
- Will you tell him?
- Of course. (Chuckles)

26:15.080 --> 26:16.217
You know him, Ross.

26:16.400 --> 26:19.540
He will never be rid of his doubts,
so why would I provoke them further?

26:20.160 --> 26:21.661
Why, even now...

26:22.760 --> 26:24.307
Yes?

26:27.480 --> 26:30.222
I suspect him of being
about some scheme or other.

26:30.400 --> 26:32.345
Against me? Never!

26:33.480 --> 26:34.902
It's his way.

26:35.080 --> 26:37.059
I've grown used to it.

26:38.280 --> 26:40.259
I'm content.

26:42.480 --> 26:44.539
- Truly?
- Yes.

26:45.440 --> 26:47.817
Truly.

27:01.880 --> 27:03.302
Mama.

27:04.040 --> 27:06.543
Valentine, my love,
is it not time for your supper?

27:08.440 --> 27:10.419
Where's Bessie?

27:13.200 --> 27:15.179
Happy to make your acquaintance, sir.

27:26.600 --> 27:28.579
Bessie, will you take him?

27:31.480 --> 27:33.300
Wait, Bessie.

27:35.400 --> 27:36.901
(Ross stamps his foot)

27:56.400 --> 27:58.664
- A fine boy.
- Yes.

28:00.440 --> 28:04.262
Did you ever think further
of that conversation we had at Sawle Church?

28:07.320 --> 28:10.221
Yes. I'm very mindful of it.

28:11.640 --> 28:15.542
Well, if you see me in Truro,
feel at liberty to ignore me.

28:16.240 --> 28:18.185
I shall.

28:30.280 --> 28:31.941
DRIVER: Go on.

28:32.120 --> 28:34.099
(Whip cracks)

29:02.160 --> 29:04.503
- Who was that?
GEOFFREY CHARLES: Mama.

29:05.400 --> 29:07.664
An unexpected visitor.

29:07.840 --> 29:09.865
Look who's come to stay.

29:15.040 --> 29:17.019
(Birdsong)

29:21.040 --> 29:22.780
(Buzzing)

29:22.960 --> 29:25.702
Can you forgive me?
For leaving you.

29:32.520 --> 29:34.067
It was what you needed.

29:34.240 --> 29:36.219
So there is nothing to forgive.

29:38.920 --> 29:40.626
How was London?

29:40.800 --> 29:44.861
Thrilling, diverting, brutal, cold.

29:46.120 --> 29:48.179
One fears for the young there.

29:50.440 --> 29:56.026
You told me, when Sarah died,
that you were never meant to be a mother.

29:57.880 --> 29:59.859
Do you think so still?

30:02.360 --> 30:04.339
I see I must be on my guard, Dr Enys.

30:05.600 --> 30:08.342
You seem determined to prove
I have feelings after all.

30:15.680 --> 30:19.628
DEMELZA: We have no savings, no wages.
We owe Falmouth 800.

30:19.800 --> 30:21.540
'Ee did all 'ee could, maid.

30:21.720 --> 30:25.907
It wasn't enough.
I could kick myself. Judas, I'm an idiot!

30:26.080 --> 30:27.581
Oh, I doubt that.

30:27.760 --> 30:29.546
Ross!

30:30.200 --> 30:32.179
- Oh, Jeremy.
- Pa!

30:34.400 --> 30:36.379
Good boy.

30:41.400 --> 30:43.061
Let me look at you.

30:46.480 --> 30:51.861
A little thinner, perhaps,
but no idiot as far as I can tell.

30:52.040 --> 30:53.985
Oh, Ross, if only you knew...

30:54.160 --> 30:57.027
Perhaps I do. Pasc0e's Bank?

30:58.680 --> 31:01.422
I met with Zaclq.
He told me of your valiant efforts.

31:01.600 --> 31:04.865
- Which all came to nought.
- Pasc0e's was ruined anyway.

31:05.040 --> 31:07.179
Did I do right or wrong, Ross?

31:08.080 --> 31:10.787
I have to know.
There was a choice to make and...

31:12.640 --> 31:14.301
What?

31:16.800 --> 31:20.224
You are worth all Westminster.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.979
Back for good, are 'ee?

31:36.520 --> 31:38.738
- As 'ee see.
- I mislike it.

31:38.920 --> 31:41.480
And when I mislike a thing,
I make it known.

31:41.640 --> 31:43.187
By burnin' down a forge?

31:43.360 --> 31:45.999
I? What?
Why would 'ee think so?

31:46.160 --> 31:47.946
'Ee do know that arson's a hangin' of fence?

31:48.120 --> 31:49.985
Arson? What? I know naught about that.

31:50.160 --> 31:53.266
Look, my brother did wrong by Rosina,

31:53.440 --> 31:55.499
but she've made 'er peace with him.

31:55.680 --> 31:57.102
Their story be done

31:57.280 --> 32:00.943
and now he've return'd,
ye'll not lay a finger 'pon him.

32:01.400 --> 32:03.027
- Will I not?
- No.

32:03.200 --> 32:06.021
For if 'ee do, you'll 'ave me to answer to.

32:06.640 --> 32:09.620
And though the Lord
do exhort us not to vengeance,

32:09.800 --> 32:12.143
for my brother's sake, I will repay.

32:41.440 --> 32:44.625
My dear Ross,
it's been a miserable business.

32:45.080 --> 32:48.425
Yeah, and I agree, if more of my friends
had been on hand,

32:48.600 --> 32:51.626
we might have weathered the storm, but...

32:51.800 --> 32:56.100
The Basset's Bank have agreed to
take over all my accounts and liabilities.

32:56.800 --> 32:58.904
Why can't the bank be reconstituted as before?

32:59.080 --> 33:00.661
With what capital?

33:00.840 --> 33:03.422
A bank must have capital
before it can start lending.

33:03.600 --> 33:04.783
That is the basis of credit.

33:04.960 --> 33:08.703
Yes. But there's not a bank in England who
can meet all of its creditors at the same time.

33:08.880 --> 33:12.543
But there's no need.
The creditors have sufficient faith in them.

33:12.720 --> 33:16.497
- What has caused yours to waiver?
- The very question I asked myself.

33:17.200 --> 33:18.861
Till somebody showed me this.

33:20.120 --> 33:21.985
Anonymous, of course.

33:22.160 --> 33:24.720
Yet I think we may guess the author.

33:25.920 --> 33:27.899
"A well-wisher"?

33:28.720 --> 33:33.657
Of course, there's no absolute proof.
But...'tis done now.

33:33.840 --> 33:37.719
And on a more cheerful note,
I shan't be entirely redundant.

33:38.480 --> 33:41.540
I've been offered the post of chief clerk
at Basset, Rogers & Co.

33:41.720 --> 33:44.063
- Oh...
- The salary is not to be sneezed at.

33:44.240 --> 33:46.219
No, it's to be spat at.

33:46.800 --> 33:49.257
Truly, Harris,
if I cannot do better for you than that...

33:49.440 --> 33:51.305
Do not attempt it.

33:51.480 --> 33:56.497
This final manoeuvre of the Warleggans,
calling in St John's loan,

33:56.680 --> 33:58.944
just as we hoped we were safe,

33:59.120 --> 34:00.337
it was masterly.

34:00.520 --> 34:04.547
And it will strengthen,
not blacken, their reputation.

34:05.240 --> 34:09.859
For who will dare challenge a family
who have the power to bring down a bank?

34:21.680 --> 34:25.059
Thank you very much
for meeting me this morning.

34:25.240 --> 34:27.219
(Music drowns conversations)

34:44.000 --> 34:45.979
Thank you very much.

34:47.600 --> 34:49.579
Much appreciated. Thank you.

35:03.120 --> 35:05.099
Suppers hot?

35:06.680 --> 35:08.659
I'm not hungry.

35:09.280 --> 35:11.145
Just weary.

35:11.320 --> 35:13.584
Of arguing, riding...

35:14.920 --> 35:16.308
...persuading.

35:16.480 --> 35:18.266
Did you persuade?

35:18.440 --> 35:24.584
There's sympathy for Pascoe
but no offers of capital to restart the bank.

35:24.760 --> 35:27.103
And we still have the problem
of how to pay our men.

35:29.800 --> 35:31.779
What's your opinion?

35:33.840 --> 35:34.977
Mine?

35:35.160 --> 35:37.025
We're partners, are we not?

35:40.040 --> 35:45.740
Well, as your partner, I think first
you should tend to your stomach.

35:47.240 --> 35:49.185
And then...

35:49.960 --> 35:54.226
...maybe tomorrow you could beg Dwight
and Caroline for a loan to pay our wages.

35:54.680 --> 35:58.309
And maybe see if Sir Francis
has aught to suggest.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.661
My thoughts entirely.

36:14.640 --> 36:15.709
- Mistress.
- Zacky.

36:15.880 --> 36:19.657
Erm, Cap'n Ross and I do wish to thank
all our workers for their patience

36:19.840 --> 36:21.785
in bearing with us till we can pay wages.

36:21.960 --> 36:24.064
'Tis well thought on, Mistress.

36:24.240 --> 36:27.141
In return, they'll get a half-day off
and an extra sixpence besides.

36:27.320 --> 36:29.265
'Twill be much appreciated.

36:29.440 --> 36:31.021
And tonight we invite all to Nampara,

36:31.200 --> 36:35.227
where we'll have a bonfire _
and a barrel of ale and star-gazy pie.

36:35.640 --> 36:37.619
Bless 'ee.

36:39.840 --> 36:41.501
It is unfortunate, yes.

36:41.680 --> 36:44.183
And I too was away
when Pasc0e's collapsed.

36:44.360 --> 36:47.864
But in truth, Captain,
the days of the small bank are done.

36:48.040 --> 36:52.739
-_So under the circumstances...
- Circumstances generated by this?

36:54.520 --> 36:59.423
Sent to 50 of Pascoe's most prominent clients.

37:02.600 --> 37:05.501
- It is monstrous.
- I've spoken With many of them.

37:05.680 --> 37:08.945
And most are willing to allow their accounts
to remain in Pascoe's hands

37:09.120 --> 37:10.667
and see him trade again.

37:10.840 --> 37:13.183
That is all well and good,
but who will finance him?

37:13.360 --> 37:14.987
Could Basset's not provide...?

37:15.160 --> 37:16.741
A loan?

37:17.640 --> 37:19.426
It would take him years to repay.

37:19.600 --> 37:22.262
No, I'm sorry,
but the amalgamation which is in process

37:22.440 --> 37:23.987
seems to me the only practical solution.

37:24.160 --> 37:26.663
Why not a new concern?

37:27.800 --> 37:30.143
"Basset's, Rogers, Pascoe & Co"?

37:30.320 --> 37:32.584
It will gain all Pasc0e's clients,
including myself.

37:32.760 --> 37:34.227
Out of the question.

37:34.400 --> 37:37.062
Pasc0e's name would bring with it
an air of failure and misjudgement.

37:37.240 --> 37:41.188
Surely his only misjudgement was to
ever cross swords with the Warleggans?

37:41.800 --> 37:46.817
Are we not agreed, every time
the Warleggans triumph over the smaller man,

37:47.000 --> 37:49.821
it makes the next "small man"
less likely to stand up to them?

37:50.000 --> 37:53.185
It would be a mistake, Captain,

37:53.360 --> 37:56.625
to press too hard from a position of weakness.

37:58.520 --> 38:03.423
Well, then, I appeal to your generosity
and your sense of fair play.

38:06.600 --> 38:08.909
- He threw you out?
- I left before he could.

38:09.080 --> 38:12.265
I could've told you not to press him.
He dislikes to be manoeuvred.

38:12.440 --> 38:14.067
You are the expert in how to direct him?

38:14.240 --> 38:16.663
Did I not persuade him
to make friends with Falmouth?

38:16.840 --> 38:19.217
Perhaps you should negotiate with him
next time.

38:19.400 --> 38:21.186
Will there be a next time?

38:26.320 --> 38:28.185
What was it the Prime Minister said?

38:29.920 --> 38:31.501
See for those you can?

38:32.280 --> 38:34.259
Then that's what we must do.

38:35.120 --> 38:36.508
(Lively fiddle music)

38:36.680 --> 38:38.625
(Chatter and laughter)

38:53.720 --> 38:54.744
(Cheering)

38:54.920 --> 38:57.480
Well, now, Ross,
you've been generous with us,

38:57.640 --> 38:59.585
so we've a little gift in return.

39:04.240 --> 39:05.980
(Onlookers gasp)

39:22.800 --> 39:24.779
(They mush)

39:28.200 --> 39:29.940
You all right?

39:30.800 --> 39:35.499
Yes, you may well venture again
and, I suspicion, be kindly received.

39:36.120 --> 39:38.759
But would 'ee not venture one last time
With Morvvenna?

39:55.400 --> 39:57.823
CAROLINE: Are you not glad
to have your husband home?

39:58.000 --> 40:00.025
In London he's exemplary.

40:00.200 --> 40:02.657
Despite profuse temptation and provocation.

40:04.360 --> 40:06.385
- You don't believe me?
- Yes.

40:06.560 --> 40:12.146
Only, London's so far away
and we're much of the year apart.

40:12.880 --> 40:15.622
Sometimes I wonder,
do Ross prefer it that way?

40:15.800 --> 40:17.779
He in London, I in Cornwall.

40:18.720 --> 40:21.939
Do distance leave him...unencumbered?

40:22.120 --> 40:24.941
- Is that the word? _
- Then go to London With him.

40:26.080 --> 40:27.581
He haven't asked me.

40:27.760 --> 40:29.307
Nor will he.

40:29.480 --> 40:31.664
He likes me here, to tend to his affairs.

40:32.400 --> 40:38.145
It's as if we're in harness and work
alongside each other but 300 miles apart.

40:40.680 --> 40:42.659
(Bell ringing)

40:46.920 --> 40:50.219
In spite of George's efforts
to grind poor folk down,

40:50.400 --> 40:52.960
the new infirmary's a grand thing, is it not?

40:53.120 --> 40:54.781
It will make a difference.

40:55.600 --> 40:57.545
I must congratulate George
when I see him.

40:57.720 --> 40:59.039
Ross, do not.

40:59.200 --> 41:01.418
For my sake, go not even near him.

41:01.600 --> 41:03.625
As you wish.

41:03.800 --> 41:08.260
RE VERE/VD.’ May I welcome you one and a
to our ceremony of dedication.

41:08.440 --> 41:14.299
It is beyond the power of language to describe
a more afflicting scene of human misery

41:14.480 --> 41:19.941
as so often presents itself in the wretched
hand of some indigent creature...

41:21.040 --> 41:27.229
...who lies languishing on the hard
and greasy pallet of sickness,

41:28.200 --> 41:30.623
dragging out his wearisome life,

41:30.800 --> 41:35.464
either wasted by slow and intermittent fevers

41:35.640 --> 41:38.143
or racked by excruciating pains...

41:38.320 --> 41:42.268
(Whispers) Compose yourself, Morwenna.
You are a Whitworth.

41:42.440 --> 41:48.265
It is for the comfort, succour, solace
and salvation of such wretched creatures

41:48.440 --> 41:53.377
that we, of nobler impulse
and finer feelings,

41:53.560 --> 41:57.667
have united in our generosity,

41:57.840 --> 42:00.183
our compassion...

42:00.360 --> 42:05.559
The renegade returns.
Too late to save his spaniel.

42:05.720 --> 42:10.942
...and have today thrown open the doors
of the new Cornwall General Infirmary.

42:11.400 --> 42:16.702
For now abideth faith, hope and charity.

42:17.560 --> 42:21.667
But the greatest of them all...is charity.

42:22.600 --> 42:25.706
Charity? Why not hope?

42:25.880 --> 42:29.577
All these benevolent, well-meaning folk,
keen to alleviate distress

42:29.760 --> 42:32.422
but how many people
care about preventing it?

42:33.200 --> 42:35.543
Not just to give money to the poor,

42:35.720 --> 42:39.144
but create conditions in which the poor
can earn money for themselves.

42:39.320 --> 42:40.662
Is that a ludicrous notion?

42:40.840 --> 42:42.546
You mistake the impulse, my friend.

42:42.720 --> 42:47.305
People give because it soothes their
conscience and bolsters their reputation.

42:48.480 --> 42:52.143
Few here are interested in genuine
empowerment for the poor.

42:54.040 --> 42:56.019
(Quietly) Well played, George.

42:56.560 --> 42:59.700
Use my cousin to bring down my bank
and lose me my savings.

42:59.880 --> 43:01.859
Masterful.

43:02.480 --> 43:04.459
Captain.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.979
Bad sign.

43:09.120 --> 43:12.578
- Basset has no good news for me.
- You always knew it was unlikely.

43:13.160 --> 43:15.139
'11: In-

43:17.600 --> 43:20.342
Mr Pascoe, I was sorry to hear
of your bank's demise.

43:20.520 --> 43:22.784
Where must I go now
for investment advice?

43:23.120 --> 43:29.582
To Basset, Rogers & Co, Where I've been so
fortunate as to secure a position as chief clerk.

43:30.200 --> 43:32.987
Do I hear you've returned to Parliament, sir?

43:33.160 --> 43:35.105
I represent the borough of St Michael.

43:35.280 --> 43:37.840
- Ah. In Whose name?
- My own.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.547
I meant, in Whose interest?

43:39.720 --> 43:41.460
Falmouth's? Basset's?

43:41.640 --> 43:44.586
I need no patron now, sir.
I own the borough.

43:47.960 --> 43:49.939
And you, Captain Poldark.

43:50.120 --> 43:52.099
How have you found Westminster?

43:52.760 --> 43:54.739
I think I've learned a little.

43:55.520 --> 43:57.260
- Yawned a little.
- Ah.

43:57.440 --> 44:00.864
I thought I was of use
and then l...| thought again.

44:01.040 --> 44:02.746
Do you find it corrupt?

44:02.920 --> 44:04.899
What is not?

44:05.080 --> 44:10.063
Is there much to choose in between politics
and other forms of power?

44:15.320 --> 44:17.299
Just the same as this town.

44:18.000 --> 44:19.581
- In What regard?
- Ross...

44:19.760 --> 44:23.947
Take, for instance,
the bank failure which occurred.

44:24.520 --> 44:28.547
Was it caused by improvidence
on the bank's part? No.

44:28.720 --> 44:33.498
It was induced from outside by corrupt power,
corruptly deployed.

44:33.680 --> 44:36.865
I have been away and have not
the benefit of common knowledge.

44:37.840 --> 44:38.943
To whom do you refer?

44:39.120 --> 44:42.578
If you do not know these names,
ask any of the traders of this town.

44:42.760 --> 44:46.309
Anyone will tell you. Unless they're afraid
that lying, anonymous letters

44:46.480 --> 44:49.267
- will be circulated about them too.
- Dear me. Ross...

44:49.440 --> 44:52.386
this seems rather like a storm in a teacup.

44:53.160 --> 44:56.345
Trying to find scapegoats
for a perfectly normal business failure.

44:56.520 --> 44:58.863
I applaud your loyalty to a friend

44:59.040 --> 45:01.702
but, as is often the case with you,
it has blinded you to the facts.

45:01.880 --> 45:03.780
- Come away, Ross.
- And the facts are these.

45:03.960 --> 45:06.144
Harris Pascoe was a foolish old man

45:09.400 --> 45:11.903
- that were entrusted to his care.
- You lie!

45:12.080 --> 45:13.945
Ross, enough.

45:14.120 --> 45:16.497
- Come away. Come away.
- This is disgraceful!

45:16.680 --> 45:20.059
- I will have you expelled from Parliament.
- Will you, George?

45:20.240 --> 45:22.219
And how will you manage that?

45:25.440 --> 45:27.749
Good gracious! Mrs Warleggan!

45:28.120 --> 45:29.940
- Dwight, help her!
- Please. Let me through.

45:30.120 --> 45:31.940
My carriage! Call for my carriage!

45:32.120 --> 45:34.099
(Overlapping voices)

45:43.680 --> 45:45.625
Were you feeling unwell prior to fainting?

45:45.800 --> 45:47.381
No, not at all.

45:47.560 --> 45:50.017
But it was so warm in the hall,
and very little air.

45:50.200 --> 45:51.269
Of course.

45:51.440 --> 45:54.261
Forgive me, if I may be so bold,

45:55.040 --> 45:57.941
is there a possibility
that you might be with child?

45:58.680 --> 46:01.740
I... No, I don't believe so.

46:27.200 --> 46:28.861
You cannot be seen here.

46:29.440 --> 46:31.385
Lady Whitworth will call the constables.

46:31.560 --> 46:33.539
I mean no harm.

46:35.320 --> 46:39.586
'Ee must know, I did give up all hope of 'ee.

46:41.000 --> 46:45.460
But Sam say I should come again...

46:47.840 --> 46:49.819
...and tell 'ee...

46:53.480 --> 46:55.459
...I love 'ee still.

46:57.600 --> 47:02.867
And so I ask one final time,
will 'ee not take me?

47:05.560 --> 47:07.903
'Tis no sin to love me.

47:08.760 --> 47:11.024
Can 'ee not see that there be hope?

47:12.680 --> 47:14.580
I did think so once,

47:17.200 --> 47:18.667
but now...

47:21.960 --> 47:25.987
Please go...and never return.

47:29.760 --> 47:31.227
I'm with child.

48:17.360 --> 48:19.339
(Both laugh)

48:20.200 --> 48:22.987
Oh, Lord, how you vex me, Ross.

48:23.920 --> 48:25.979
Must you always rise to George's bait?

48:26.160 --> 48:29.140
- Why did you not prevent me?
- Am I my husband's keeper?

48:29.320 --> 48:31.345
That is your task, is it not?

48:32.000 --> 48:33.865
To be the better part of me.

48:34.040 --> 48:36.019
(He chuckles)

48:36.840 --> 48:38.102
Oh.

48:39.320 --> 48:42.027
I only Wish we'd achieved
more on Pascoe's behalf.

48:43.200 --> 48:45.623
He deserves more
than to be a humble clerk.

48:45.800 --> 48:47.825
(Footsteps)

48:48.000 --> 48:49.979
This come for Mr Ross.

49:11.640 --> 49:14.063
- Dr Enys...
- My love?

49:14.640 --> 49:16.699
You know I am a hard creature.

49:16.880 --> 49:20.862
And, as we've established, I have no heart.

49:22.000 --> 49:25.106
And it's been weeks
since I returned from London.

49:25.680 --> 49:28.865
And already you grow restless?

49:29.480 --> 49:32.040
You wonder when you can decently return?

49:33.120 --> 49:34.781
I've observed it, my love.

49:34.960 --> 49:37.861
It's not in your nature
to be starved of company.

49:38.320 --> 49:43.383
Now I know myself better,
I realise I am a creature that needs variety.

49:43.560 --> 49:45.539
London as well as Cornwall.

49:48.280 --> 49:51.226
This time, I want my husband with me.

49:55.920 --> 49:58.104
If only to prove to your friends he exists?

49:58.280 --> 50:00.862
- Am I so obvious?
- Only to me. (Chuckles)

50:14.520 --> 50:15.908
(Door opens)

50:19.160 --> 50:23.620
Forgive me...
I know you dislike Dr Choake.

50:23.800 --> 50:25.188
You've not summoned him?

50:25.360 --> 50:27.464
My dear, I had no choice.

50:27.640 --> 50:31.906
This nausea has not abated for a week.
I cannot bear to see you suffer.

50:38.600 --> 50:42.548
Gentlemen, I call to order this meeting
of the banking partners.

50:43.120 --> 50:49.582
Before we begin, I must extend a welcome
to our newest partner, Harris Pascoe.

50:50.480 --> 50:53.347
You will all note a last-minute addition
to our number.

50:53.520 --> 50:55.306
Some of you may query this.

50:55.480 --> 51:00.179
The name in question brings no money,
never will, not being the type to accumulate.

51:00.360 --> 51:05.297
But he's making quite the name for himself
both here and in the capital,

51:05.480 --> 51:08.381
so I think he is an asset in himself.

51:13.160 --> 51:16.744
Captain Poldark,
I am delighted you could join us.

51:20.400 --> 51:22.539
No-one was more surprised than I.

51:22.720 --> 51:26.702
Lord, What a personage you be these days!

51:26.880 --> 51:29.519
Everyone do Wish to join their name to yours.

51:30.480 --> 51:33.187
Perhaps soon you'll be
too grand to talk to me.

51:33.360 --> 51:35.339
It's only a matter of time.

51:36.080 --> 51:38.503
Yet truly, Ross, as a banker and an MP,

51:38.680 --> 51:42.309
will not all manner of inducements
come your way?

51:43.240 --> 51:45.219
I should hope so.

51:45.880 --> 51:47.859
But you'll remain immune?

51:49.360 --> 51:51.339
Will I?

51:51.520 --> 51:53.306
I know you.

51:53.480 --> 51:56.267
In which case, perhaps I'd better decline
that very generous offer

51:56.440 --> 51:58.465
which was made to me only today.

51:58.640 --> 51:59.823
Which?

52:00.000 --> 52:02.901
The use of a luxurious carriage
to take me to London.

52:04.760 --> 52:06.739
Along with my Wife.

52:08.360 --> 52:10.339
What?

52:11.360 --> 52:13.339
You Wish me to decline?

52:15.520 --> 52:17.704
You Wish me to come to London with you?

52:20.800 --> 52:22.119
(They mush)

52:31.360 --> 52:33.339
(Demelza sighs) Should I be going?

52:34.640 --> 52:35.902
Naturally you're anxious.

52:36.080 --> 52:38.662
But sometimes there are matters
that may only be attended to

52:38.840 --> 52:40.705
when husband and Wife are together.

52:40.880 --> 52:42.780
- Am I right, Dr Enys?
- Always, my love.

52:45.400 --> 52:47.220
It's only a month.

52:47.400 --> 52:49.504
I_ cannot believe
we must ride away and forget 'em.

52:49.680 --> 52:52.422
Rest assured, in 20 years' time
they'll ride away and forget us.

52:52.600 --> 52:54.579
Don't say that.

53:04.120 --> 53:06.259
Let's wave goodbye.

53:07.480 --> 53:09.983
- That's it. Look at them.
- (Whip cracks)

53:30.440 --> 53:32.419
(Birdsong)

53:35.840 --> 53:37.580
(Footsteps approaching)

53:39.320 --> 53:44.826
Dr Choake prescribed several powders
to be taken thrice daily for a fortnight.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.343
He recommends purging,
bleeding, blistering and...

53:47.520 --> 53:48.703
No.

53:48.880 --> 53:51.064
- My dear?
- That will not be necessary.

53:52.640 --> 53:54.779
Dr Choake is mistook.

53:54.960 --> 53:56.541
I'm not ill.

53:56.720 --> 53:58.187
I'm with child.

54:01.160 --> 54:03.344
My dear...

54:03.520 --> 54:06.341
But... But this is wonderful news.

54:06.520 --> 54:09.626
Oh, I cannot tell you how overjoyed...

54:09.800 --> 54:11.540
No, but you must...you must rest.

54:11.720 --> 54:15.417
You must allow me to take charge
of all your needs and wishes.

54:15.600 --> 54:17.818
When... When may we expect...?

54:18.400 --> 54:20.584
I think December.

54:21.240 --> 54:23.026
- Or thereabouts.
- December.

54:23.200 --> 54:25.782
Well, we will...
We will take a house in Mayfair.

54:25.960 --> 54:27.825
We might even have the child in London.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.639
And let us hope for a girl this time.

54:30.800 --> 54:32.347
Would that not be delightful?

54:32.520 --> 54:34.624
Oh, my dear.

54:34.800 --> 54:37.746
Ah, Uncle...we have good news.

54:37.920 --> 54:39.387
And I have bad.

54:39.560 --> 54:44.259
Basset's Bank 'corporated Pasc0e's
to form the Cornish Bank.

54:44.440 --> 54:49.025
Among the partners
listed in the new enterprise is Ross Poldark.

54:55.080 --> 54:57.059
No matter.

55:12.960 --> 55:16.942
Oh, Judas, Ross.
Why didn't you wake me?

55:18.080 --> 55:19.866
How did I get like this?

55:20.040 --> 55:21.905
You fell asleep fully clothed.

55:23.280 --> 55:27.023
- I put you to bed.
- And failed to furnish me a nightgown?

55:28.560 --> 55:31.199
- Do you need one?
- I need one now.

55:35.400 --> 55:37.584
- Go and fetch it.
- (Demelza laughs)

55:39.040 --> 55:41.099
A gentleman would fetch it for me.

55:41.280 --> 55:43.259
That depends on the gentleman.

55:45.200 --> 55:47.464
'Tis too bright, Ross.

55:47.640 --> 55:49.904
One don't look becoming in daylight.

55:53.760 --> 55:55.466
I disagree.

55:55.920 --> 55:57.626
Are you going to hand it to me or not?

55:58.120 --> 55:59.189
Not.

55:59.360 --> 56:01.066
(Laughs)

56:14.640 --> 56:15.709
(Shrieks)

56:15.880 --> 56:18.986
- No, you can't have me.
- Oh, yes, I can.

56:21.560 --> 56:23.460
You're my prisoner.

56:24.560 --> 56:27.461
My present...
to be unwrapped at leisure.

56:29.160 --> 56:31.025
- (Knock at door)
WOMAN: Sir.

56:31.200 --> 56:33.760
Mrs Parkins says breakfast is served.

56:34.200 --> 56:36.760
Tell Mrs Parkins we shall be down in an hour.

56:38.400 --> 56:40.265
Or two.

56:40.440 --> 56:42.624
I thought you liked me best in Cornwall.

56:42.800 --> 56:45.462
A Demelza in Cornwall is a wondrous thing.

56:47.800 --> 56:50.257
But a Demelza in London is even better.
