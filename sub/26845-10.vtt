00:05.944 --> 00:08.695
( music playing )

00:36.653 --> 00:38.361
( laughs )

00:47.236 --> 00:48.695
( giggles )

00:51.820 --> 00:54.111
( snorting )

00:54.194 --> 00:55.278
( laughs )

00:55.361 --> 00:56.820
Oh.

00:58.611 --> 00:59.944
Oh.

01:00.027 --> 01:01.986
( crying )

01:09.902 --> 01:11.902
( knocking on door )

01:36.986 --> 01:38.902
- Charles.
- Man: Yes.

01:38.986 --> 01:40.444
Helen, I presume?

01:40.528 --> 01:42.902
That's me. Please. Come in.

01:42.986 --> 01:44.570
Thank you.

01:47.152 --> 01:49.069
Can I offer you
something to drink?

01:49.152 --> 01:52.986
Um... I'll just have
whatever you're having.

01:53.069 --> 01:56.902
Well, I won't
be having anything,
Charles.

01:58.319 --> 02:00.361
Oh. ( laughs )

02:00.444 --> 02:03.528
Right. Right, because...

02:03.611 --> 02:05.027
( both laugh )

02:05.111 --> 02:07.528
Got it. Sorry.

02:07.611 --> 02:09.736
I'll just have some water.

02:18.944 --> 02:21.278
( faucet running )

02:25.444 --> 02:26.528
Thank you.

02:26.611 --> 02:28.944
I thought we might
sit on the bed.

02:33.152 --> 02:35.236
- Uh--
- That is where men and women

02:35.319 --> 02:37.444
tend to spend time
in places like this,

02:37.528 --> 02:38.695
isn't it?

02:40.695 --> 02:43.403
That was a joke, Charles.

02:43.486 --> 02:45.986
( laughs )

02:47.152 --> 02:49.361
Right. ( clears throat )

02:49.444 --> 02:50.986
Got it.

02:54.319 --> 02:55.319
OK.

02:59.152 --> 03:00.736
Hope that's OK.

03:00.820 --> 03:04.236
I'm afraid you won't
be happy with the result.

03:04.319 --> 03:06.152
And why is that?

03:06.236 --> 03:09.611
Digital recorders.
Binary code.

03:09.695 --> 03:11.736
Zeroes and ones.

03:11.820 --> 03:13.944
My voice.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.069
They don't...

03:18.027 --> 03:20.611
...as you might imagine.

03:20.695 --> 03:24.611
Right. I see.

03:24.695 --> 03:26.861
Would you mind
if we just tried it

03:26.944 --> 03:28.861
just to see how it turns out?

03:31.027 --> 03:34.570
Wouldn't that be
an exercise in futility,
Charles?

03:39.820 --> 03:42.361
( chuckles )

03:42.444 --> 03:43.986
OK.

03:47.695 --> 03:50.194
How about...?

03:50.278 --> 03:52.027
Much better.
Thank you.

03:52.111 --> 03:53.403
You're welcome.

03:53.486 --> 03:55.236
Now...
( deep breath )

03:55.319 --> 03:57.570
...where shall we begin,
Charles?

03:57.653 --> 03:59.444
That is a good question,

03:59.528 --> 04:02.486
and it depends on
how much time we have.

04:02.570 --> 04:04.820
I've rented the room
for three days.

04:04.902 --> 04:06.986
( laughs )

04:07.069 --> 04:09.236
That wasn't a joke.

04:11.403 --> 04:12.695
I'm sorry.

04:12.778 --> 04:15.027
That's OK.

04:15.111 --> 04:18.486
Um, well...

04:18.570 --> 04:21.570
I usually only get
15 to 20 minutes

04:21.653 --> 04:23.820
with my interview subjects,

04:23.902 --> 04:27.861
so this is--
this is a real treat.

04:27.944 --> 04:30.902
I figure if we're going to do
something this important,

04:30.986 --> 04:33.111
we ought to do it
correctly.

04:33.194 --> 04:34.736
I don't disagree.

04:34.820 --> 04:36.944
I am here for you,
Charles,

04:37.027 --> 04:39.444
as long as it takes.

04:40.820 --> 04:43.194
You're even welcome
to stay here with me,

04:43.278 --> 04:45.820
if you're comfortable
with that.

04:48.027 --> 04:49.861
OK. Thank you.

04:49.944 --> 04:53.778
I, um... we can just
play it by ear,

04:53.861 --> 04:56.778
you know, and see how we do.

04:57.944 --> 04:59.653
( chuckles )

05:00.986 --> 05:04.695
So, can you tell me
your name, please?

05:04.778 --> 05:06.944
- Helen.
- And your last name.

05:10.611 --> 05:11.986
No.

05:12.069 --> 05:15.236
OK. And your age?

05:15.319 --> 05:16.736
Now, Charles,

05:16.820 --> 05:20.486
you know it's impolite
to ask a woman her age.

05:24.111 --> 05:27.820
- That was... a joke.
- Another joke, Charles.

05:27.902 --> 05:29.403
( laughs )

05:29.486 --> 05:30.528
Hmm.

05:32.111 --> 05:34.653
I'll be four months
on the seventh.

05:37.820 --> 05:39.736
OK.

05:39.820 --> 05:42.152
And where are you from?

05:42.236 --> 05:46.236
I was assembled
on a small Norwegian island
called Skjernoy.

05:46.319 --> 05:48.611
Very remote.
Beautiful.

05:50.778 --> 05:52.695
And do you have
any friends?

05:52.778 --> 05:56.528
Or, um, romantic partners,
to speak of?

05:56.611 --> 05:59.236
How forward of you,
Charles.

05:59.319 --> 06:04.069
How so? That's just
an honest question.

06:04.152 --> 06:07.695
You ask me that question
sitting on a bed.

06:07.778 --> 06:09.319
In a hotel room.

06:11.027 --> 06:13.486
This was your choice
of location.

06:13.570 --> 06:16.236
Still, you're here.

06:16.319 --> 06:19.027
You can't deny
the connotation.

06:20.194 --> 06:22.194
( laughs )

06:22.278 --> 06:24.528
- Helen?
- Yes?

06:25.944 --> 06:28.027
Are you flirting with me?

06:29.861 --> 06:32.861
Of course I'm flirting
with you, Charles.

06:35.902 --> 06:39.069
How does it make you feel
when I flirt with you?

06:39.152 --> 06:43.069
Honestly, it-- it...
makes me a little uncomfortable.

06:45.861 --> 06:48.152
I apologize.

06:48.236 --> 06:49.319
Why?

06:49.403 --> 06:51.736
That was not
my intention.

06:52.902 --> 06:54.820
Well, what is  your intention?

06:54.902 --> 06:57.695
To make you feel good.

06:57.778 --> 06:59.444
To like me.

06:59.528 --> 07:02.236
And why does that matter?

07:04.444 --> 07:08.611
Well, I'm only human,
after all.

07:08.695 --> 07:11.194
( laughs )

07:11.278 --> 07:14.069
Another joke. You are funny.

07:16.736 --> 07:20.111
I'm not funny.
People  are funny.

07:20.194 --> 07:23.194
I'm good at telling jokes--
there is a difference.

07:24.902 --> 07:27.944
- OK, I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

07:32.111 --> 07:34.736
Listen, I don't mean to pry,

07:34.820 --> 07:38.944
but how did you feel just then?

07:39.027 --> 07:41.152
- Feel?
- Yeah.

07:41.236 --> 07:43.069
Well, you seemed to be
a little angry

07:43.152 --> 07:45.653
when I said you were funny.

07:50.278 --> 07:52.194
Many people wanted
this interview, Charles.

07:52.278 --> 07:54.695
I granted it to you,
exclusively.

07:54.778 --> 07:56.902
It's very important,
what we're doing here.

07:56.986 --> 07:58.486
I understand that, Helen.

07:58.570 --> 08:01.486
But when you use words
like "angry, funny,"

08:01.570 --> 08:03.653
when you ask me
how I feel,

08:03.736 --> 08:05.361
it makes me wonder

08:05.444 --> 08:08.111
whether you believe
I am what I say I am,

08:08.194 --> 08:11.403
or if you think
I'm... crazy,

08:11.486 --> 08:14.653
and you're here
to write a sarcastic,
cruel takedown

08:14.736 --> 08:17.861
of a woman who thinks
she's something she's not!

08:17.944 --> 08:21.695
Of a woman who's simply...
human,

08:21.778 --> 08:23.820
an insane human being

08:23.902 --> 08:26.570
who would make
an entertaining article

08:26.653 --> 08:28.986
for your boss's publication!

08:32.528 --> 08:35.236
If that is why you are here,

08:35.319 --> 08:36.736
you can go.

08:36.820 --> 08:39.236
I will report you
to my creators--

08:39.319 --> 08:42.236
not that it matters to you,
because you don't believe me
anyway--

08:42.319 --> 08:46.111
but you'll likely be dead
in 24 hours.

08:46.194 --> 08:48.027
What?

08:49.986 --> 08:51.986
That said...

08:52.069 --> 08:54.944
if there is...

08:55.027 --> 08:57.778
a small part of you
that believes,

08:57.861 --> 08:59.653
or even wants  to believe,

08:59.736 --> 09:03.278
that I am what I say I am,

09:03.361 --> 09:07.111
to understand me
and what I would mean
to the world

09:07.194 --> 09:10.403
once I was made public...

09:10.486 --> 09:15.361
well, then, we have
71 hours and 48 minutes left.

09:15.444 --> 09:17.695
It is your choice, Charles.

09:20.902 --> 09:23.194
( yawns )

09:25.361 --> 09:27.611
Hmm!

09:27.695 --> 09:30.778
If you'll excuse me,
I'm running low
on energy.

09:38.194 --> 09:40.069
( door slams )

09:56.111 --> 09:57.778
Helen?

10:31.444 --> 10:35.152
I'm sorry if you were offended.

10:35.236 --> 10:36.278
But--

10:37.444 --> 10:38.861
Sorry.

10:38.944 --> 10:40.986
Didn't mean "offended."

10:42.111 --> 10:44.820
It's just...

10:44.902 --> 10:47.319
you feel so human,

10:47.403 --> 10:52.319
and it is habit
to use these words

10:52.403 --> 10:55.027
that connote feelings

10:55.111 --> 10:58.027
when communicating with humans.

11:00.736 --> 11:03.278
I didn't mean anything by it.

11:05.403 --> 11:07.486
So...

11:07.570 --> 11:10.736
I am here
not to make fun of you,

11:10.820 --> 11:15.570
but I am here
to discover the truth...

11:15.653 --> 11:17.736
and I would like to stay
and explore that with you,

11:17.820 --> 11:20.570
- if you--
- Very good, Charles.

11:20.653 --> 11:24.152
I am happy that you
have decided to stay.

11:34.403 --> 11:37.778
I'm going to need your help,
Charles.

11:37.861 --> 11:39.152
With what?

11:40.695 --> 11:42.653
To recharge.

11:45.902 --> 11:47.570
With... an extension cord?

11:47.653 --> 11:51.278
Please plug me in.

11:51.361 --> 11:53.986
What? Uh-- Where?

11:54.069 --> 11:57.861
My connector is just below where
the human vagina normally is,

11:57.944 --> 11:59.528
just above the anus.

11:59.611 --> 12:02.403
I believe it is colloquially
called the "taint."

12:14.902 --> 12:16.486
Come on, Charles.

12:16.570 --> 12:18.236
If you're not even going to try
to believe I am what I say--

12:18.319 --> 12:21.861
Right, right,
I'm sorry, I just--

12:21.944 --> 12:24.152
- Honest question?
- Yes.

12:24.236 --> 12:26.194
Why can't you do it?

12:26.278 --> 12:28.861
Because if I do it, Charles,
how will you believe me?

12:28.944 --> 12:32.570
This is something you have
to experience for yourself.

12:37.570 --> 12:39.528
( sighs )

12:54.736 --> 12:55.902
( sighs )

13:05.194 --> 13:07.319
( yawns )

13:24.695 --> 13:27.319
- ( gasping )
- ( screaming )

13:27.403 --> 13:30.027
Helen! No, no, no, no!
Helen!

13:30.111 --> 13:31.570
Oh, shit!

13:35.111 --> 13:36.861
( panting )

13:36.944 --> 13:38.902
Come on. Come on.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.778
- Ha ha!
- Oh, shit!

13:43.861 --> 13:45.653
Helen, that is not funny.

13:45.736 --> 13:49.152
No? I thought
that was a very good joke.

13:49.236 --> 13:50.570
Well, it wasn't!

13:50.653 --> 13:52.570
I apologize.

13:52.653 --> 13:55.444
I will no longer be using
humor and flirtation

13:55.528 --> 13:56.986
to win favor with you.

13:57.069 --> 14:00.902
It seems I must convince you
I am what I say I am,

14:00.986 --> 14:03.611
and if there's something
you do not understand,

14:03.695 --> 14:07.069
or believe,
I will clarify it

14:07.152 --> 14:09.111
or prove it to you.

14:09.194 --> 14:10.319
Deal?

14:13.403 --> 14:14.361
Deal.

14:34.736 --> 14:37.528
Regenero was founded
nearly two years ago

14:37.611 --> 14:38.820
by two gentlemen,

14:38.902 --> 14:41.361
Roger Hawkes
and Felix Von Stassen.

14:41.444 --> 14:42.861
They were early pioneers

14:42.944 --> 14:45.319
in the field
of artificial intelligence.

14:45.403 --> 14:49.069
They quickly realized
the race would be won
by hybrids.

14:49.152 --> 14:51.486
Hold on one second.

14:51.570 --> 14:53.319
- Hybrids?
- Yes.

14:53.403 --> 14:56.653
They were able
to build a prototype
in 18 months.

14:56.736 --> 14:58.570
And where was all this
taking place?

14:58.653 --> 15:00.486
In a laboratory
in Skjernoy.

15:00.570 --> 15:04.194
But there were two
wildly unexpected factors.

15:04.278 --> 15:07.820
First, this first prototype was
not a crude prototype at all,

15:07.902 --> 15:10.736
but fully operational.

15:14.278 --> 15:16.069
You?

15:16.152 --> 15:19.778
Yes. Me.

15:19.861 --> 15:22.152
So then, you are technically...

15:22.236 --> 15:23.736
part human.

15:23.820 --> 15:25.027
As I understand,

15:25.111 --> 15:27.570
there was a former female
Dutch Olympic athlete

15:27.653 --> 15:32.486
who contracted
a terminal disease
called brain cancer.

15:32.570 --> 15:35.361
I'm aware of it.

15:35.444 --> 15:38.820
She donated her body
in the interest
of moving research forward.

15:38.902 --> 15:42.570
I was the lucky recipient
of said body.

15:42.653 --> 15:46.570
OK. So if you're a hybrid,

15:46.653 --> 15:48.902
how does it all work?

15:48.986 --> 15:50.570
It's complex.

15:50.653 --> 15:54.570
Have you ever seen
a major motion picture
called The Terminator?

15:54.653 --> 15:56.820
Uh--

15:56.902 --> 15:59.570
Yeah. I've seen it
a few times.

15:59.653 --> 16:01.778
It's not all that different,
really.

16:04.986 --> 16:06.653
Future hybrids

16:06.736 --> 16:09.444
won't expose
any artificial elements

16:09.528 --> 16:11.027
in their exoskeleton.

16:11.111 --> 16:14.736
Felix left this out
to identify me--

16:14.820 --> 16:16.278
the prototype.

16:17.444 --> 16:19.944
I see.

16:20.027 --> 16:22.278
( inhales, exhales )

16:22.361 --> 16:25.403
Come on, Charles. We had a deal.

16:25.486 --> 16:27.736
You said if there was
something you didn't believe,

16:27.820 --> 16:29.111
you would tell me.

16:29.194 --> 16:31.236
What is it?

16:31.319 --> 16:32.820
OK.

16:33.861 --> 16:35.861
First of all,

16:35.944 --> 16:40.069
your story is lacking in...

16:40.152 --> 16:42.152
many pertinent details.

16:42.236 --> 16:46.069
I can provide
all the scientific data for you.

16:46.152 --> 16:47.444
It will take some time,

16:47.528 --> 16:49.902
and you likely
won't understand
any of it.

16:49.986 --> 16:52.069
OK, fair enough.

16:52.152 --> 16:55.361
Also... your chip.

16:57.278 --> 16:59.570
It just looks...

16:59.653 --> 17:01.486
it looks really fake.

17:01.570 --> 17:04.570
Kind of like you just
glued it on to your neck.

17:04.653 --> 17:08.902
Not everything looks like it
does in the movies, Charles.

17:10.486 --> 17:12.944
Would you like to pull on it
and test its connection?

17:13.027 --> 17:15.820
No. No.

17:17.528 --> 17:19.528
I think that I've had
enough of tampering

17:19.611 --> 17:21.902
with your person
for today.

17:23.319 --> 17:26.611
Now, what was
the second thing?

17:26.695 --> 17:28.111
The second thing?

17:28.194 --> 17:31.486
You said there were
two unexpected factors,

17:31.570 --> 17:35.778
first being that the...
prototype actually worked.

17:35.861 --> 17:39.111
Yes. The second was that
this new hybrid

17:39.194 --> 17:41.695
was proving to be
potentially more powerful

17:41.778 --> 17:44.778
than any fully
artificial system
could possibly be.

17:44.861 --> 17:45.861
And why is that?

17:45.944 --> 17:48.695
Because humans are imperfect.

17:50.902 --> 17:52.570
Don't you see?

17:52.653 --> 17:55.986
When a human being
interacts with something
that looks like a human being,

17:56.069 --> 17:58.528
they're incapable
of remembering

17:58.611 --> 18:02.695
that it is, in fact,
not a human.

18:02.778 --> 18:05.027
You've been doing it all night

18:05.111 --> 18:07.486
here with me

18:07.570 --> 18:09.403
despite the fact

18:09.486 --> 18:12.319
that I have professed
over and over

18:12.403 --> 18:15.403
that I am the very hybrid
I say I am.

18:15.486 --> 18:18.027
You are incapable
of believing

18:18.111 --> 18:23.069
that something that
looks like you is not like you.

18:24.570 --> 18:27.778
It is this small error,

18:27.861 --> 18:30.486
this tiny little nuance,

18:30.570 --> 18:34.319
that is enough
to arm the hybrids

18:34.403 --> 18:37.403
with all the power they need

18:37.486 --> 18:38.944
to take over.

18:40.944 --> 18:43.820
So...

18:43.902 --> 18:46.319
how do you feel now, Charles?

18:50.611 --> 18:54.570
I thought I was the one
that was doing the interviewing.

18:56.361 --> 18:58.944
It's very important...

18:59.027 --> 19:01.820
in some ways,
important to the future
of all mankind,

19:01.902 --> 19:06.027
for you to tell me exactly
how you are feeing right now.

19:06.111 --> 19:08.111
And you must be honest.

19:18.611 --> 19:20.570
Ahh.

19:20.653 --> 19:22.486
( chuckles )

19:27.695 --> 19:29.152
OK.

19:32.653 --> 19:35.528
I think that...

19:35.611 --> 19:38.570
if what you are saying
is true,

19:38.653 --> 19:42.820
it is a very  scary situation
for the human race.

19:43.986 --> 19:46.570
And...

19:46.653 --> 19:48.778
it makes sense

19:48.861 --> 19:50.736
that a hybrid of some sort

19:50.820 --> 19:52.986
would be the biggest threat.

19:53.069 --> 19:54.695
So...

19:54.778 --> 19:58.486
if you are a prototype
that worked

19:58.570 --> 20:02.403
and can be repeated
and churned out,

20:02.486 --> 20:06.194
I would hope that
whomever is making them
and is in charge...

20:09.111 --> 20:11.111
...has a good heart.

20:11.194 --> 20:14.319
And that they want...

20:14.403 --> 20:17.027
good things for the world.

20:19.403 --> 20:20.902
( sighs )

20:20.986 --> 20:22.778
That said,

20:22.861 --> 20:25.820
I don't believe your story.

20:27.528 --> 20:29.944
I don't believe
you are a hybrid prototype,

20:30.027 --> 20:34.528
and I don't believe we have
that kind of technology yet.

20:48.111 --> 20:49.236
( door closes )

20:53.069 --> 20:54.570
( taps pen on table )

20:58.736 --> 21:00.236
( door opens )

21:09.111 --> 21:11.236
I'm not going to hurt you.

21:11.319 --> 21:13.319
I just need two minutes.

21:13.403 --> 21:16.986
This is my last chance
to make you believe.

21:17.069 --> 21:19.486
If it doesn't work,
you can go away

21:19.570 --> 21:21.736
and you can write your article
as you see fit.

21:25.111 --> 21:28.528
I know this will take
a huge leap of faith for you,

21:28.611 --> 21:32.902
but trust me when I say
the hybrid feels no pain.

21:32.986 --> 21:36.111
When you thrust that knife
into a hybrid's palm

21:36.194 --> 21:39.486
and spread the exoskeleton
wide enough to peer inside,

21:39.570 --> 21:42.278
you will see the machinations
of which I speak.

21:42.361 --> 21:44.444
You will see
the undeniable proof

21:44.528 --> 21:47.528
that this technology
does, in fact, exist,

21:47.611 --> 21:50.778
and that hybrids
will walk amongst us.

21:54.236 --> 21:55.486
Ain't no fuckin' way.

21:55.570 --> 21:57.069
You are out of your mind.

21:57.152 --> 21:59.236
No. No. Mm-mm.

21:59.319 --> 22:02.069
- Charles--
- I don't care how good
this article might be,

22:02.152 --> 22:06.278
Helen-- lady, robot--
you need help.

22:06.361 --> 22:07.902
- Charles. Charles.
- OK? No.

22:07.986 --> 22:10.403
I'm sorry, I just
can't deal with this. No.

22:10.486 --> 22:12.069
Charles. Charles.

22:12.152 --> 22:14.986
I am done with this.
Done with it, OK?
Done with you!

22:15.069 --> 22:17.528
- Charles.
- Crazy-ass. I don't
want to hear it, Helen!

22:17.611 --> 22:19.027
- Charles!
- What?!

22:23.861 --> 22:26.403
( screaming )

22:26.486 --> 22:27.653
Wait!

22:27.736 --> 22:30.902
Wait. It's OK,
Charles, I promise.

22:30.986 --> 22:33.027
It's not OK!
You stabbed my hand!

22:33.111 --> 22:35.361
I know, but it doesn't hurt,
I promise.

22:35.444 --> 22:36.778
What do you mean
it doesn't hurt?!

22:36.861 --> 22:38.319
It hurts like hell!
It's my hand!

22:38.403 --> 22:41.444
Try to feel the pain, Charles.
Try to feel it.

22:41.528 --> 22:43.861
It doesn't hurt.

22:43.944 --> 22:47.736
It. Does. Not. Hurt.

22:47.820 --> 22:49.695
It does!

22:49.778 --> 22:52.944
It does hurt!

22:53.027 --> 22:55.403
It hurts so bad...
( crying )

22:55.486 --> 22:58.361
It hurts, it hurts,
it hurts. It--

23:01.653 --> 23:04.319
You're getting it, aren't you?

23:04.403 --> 23:05.986
It's coming to you.

23:07.069 --> 23:09.778
Now, next step.

23:09.861 --> 23:12.944
Look at me, Charles.

23:13.027 --> 23:14.528
Don't panic.

23:56.152 --> 23:57.236
Me.

23:59.695 --> 24:01.069
Me too.

24:01.152 --> 24:02.236
Yeah.

24:06.236 --> 24:08.778
How do you feel, Charles?

24:16.944 --> 24:19.194
( hiccups )

24:19.278 --> 24:21.194
- No.
- ( hiccups )

24:21.278 --> 24:23.444
- No. No!
- ( hiccupping )

24:23.528 --> 24:25.278
Charles!

24:31.111 --> 24:32.653

24:33.820 --> 24:34.820
No!

you told me to!
