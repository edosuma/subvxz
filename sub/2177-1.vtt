01:32.836 --> 01:34.221
Mrs. Margaret.

01:35.039 --> 01:38.650
- Oh, look at that pretty broach.
- Aren't you so kind?

01:39.110 --> 01:41.535
You have yourself a lovely day,
Mr. Georgie Wits.

02:04.835 --> 02:07.872
Remember when we promised we'd wait
till you graduated to get out of here?

02:07.972 --> 02:09.384
Yeah.

02:09.497 --> 02:11.409
You been out...

02:11.709 --> 02:13.529
three years now.

02:14.678 --> 02:17.415
But the situation changed.

02:17.515 --> 02:19.450
Got your daddy to take care of.

02:19.550 --> 02:21.216
Well...

02:21.853 --> 02:23.920
I wish I could put him
in one of them homes.

02:24.020 --> 02:25.160
That ain't true.

02:25.260 --> 02:27.957
I wish I could put him into one of them homes
and just make my peace with him.

02:30.360 --> 02:32.862
There's what... 3,000 people live here?

02:33.964 --> 02:38.067
I know 'em all. By face, at least.

02:38.669 --> 02:42.137
They smile at me, caring for my dad.

02:42.906 --> 02:45.343
They'll turn on me in a heartbeat,
they find out I wanna bail.

02:45.443 --> 02:48.346
Everybody's in everybody's business.

02:48.446 --> 02:51.450
Hey. Come on.

02:53.216 --> 02:56.220
- You can be sad, Dwayne.
- I ain't sad.

02:56.320 --> 02:58.387
I'm bothered.

03:12.669 --> 03:14.472
Hey! Shit-heads.

03:14.572 --> 03:18.009
Can't you see there's a whole big field
there to throw your ball around on?

03:18.109 --> 03:20.945
Yeah, but ain't you pervin' right now?

03:21.045 --> 03:23.512
Piss off, both of ya!

03:30.620 --> 03:32.288
For me?

03:33.419 --> 03:34.490
Thank you, ma'am.

03:43.733 --> 03:47.438
- Come on. Give it another go. Video's on.
- I'm not ready, Dwayne. I need a rehearsal.

03:47.738 --> 03:49.529
There's no time for a rehearsal.
Sun's fallin'.

03:50.641 --> 03:53.010
I feel stupid, Dwayne.

03:53.739 --> 03:55.811
Well, you look like a starlet.

03:57.014 --> 04:01.010
- Really?
- Yeah. Just like Natalie Wood.

04:01.519 --> 04:03.788
Think on it like it's just me and you
practicing in your room, okay?

04:03.888 --> 04:05.990
I'll video the rehearsal.

04:06.090 --> 04:07.456
Okay.

04:10.694 --> 04:15.733
Hi! Welcome to Cut Bank, Montana,
where the Rockies meet the Plains.

04:15.833 --> 04:17.402
My name's Cassandra Steeley,

04:17.502 --> 04:21.505
and I'd like to show you my town
full of cheer and wonted kindness.

04:21.606 --> 04:26.677
Here we're surrounded by miles
and miles of wheat and canola fields

04:26.777 --> 04:28.880
and soaring mountains.

04:28.980 --> 04:31.490
There's a Blackfoot Indian reservation
close by that gives us

04:31.590 --> 04:33.818
rich cultural diversity.

04:33.918 --> 04:37.252
- Cut Bank's a treasure from a bygone ti...
- Get down!

04:41.058 --> 04:42.994
Dwayne!

04:43.094 --> 04:44.760
Stay down.

04:47.340 --> 04:49.066
Oh, shit.

04:58.575 --> 05:00.311
<i>...soaring mountains.</i>

05:00.411 --> 05:02.828
<i>There's a Blackfoot Indian reservation
close by that gives us</i>

05:02.928 --> 05:04.849
<i>rich cultural diversity.</i>

05:04.949 --> 05:07.084
<i>Cut Bank's a treasure
from a bygone ti...</i>

05:07.184 --> 05:08.574
That ain't it. He shoots him again.

05:08.874 --> 05:12.315
Imaginin' suits me.
Already more disappointin'

05:12.415 --> 05:14.158
- than I'd like to think on.
- Dinner's ready!

05:14.258 --> 05:16.461
- We should call Sheriff Vogel.
- Like this instant.

05:16.561 --> 05:18.696
- We can drive down to see him.
- Dinner's ready.

05:18.796 --> 05:21.819
All right. We're comin'.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.268
Daddy, we just seen a manslaughter.

05:24.368 --> 05:27.303
Go sit yourselves down to eat,
and I'll phone the sheriff.

05:28.405 --> 05:31.109
- Thanks, Big Stan.
- Call me "sir."

05:31.209 --> 05:34.345
And no mention of this
over the table, okay?

05:34.445 --> 05:37.112
You and me and the sheriff
will talk it over when he comes.

05:44.254 --> 05:46.443
- Big Stan.
- Roland.

05:46.543 --> 05:51.529
Ought I insist once and again you call me
Sheriff Vogel? Or you old of the ear?

05:51.829 --> 05:54.632
I see you're still fingerin'
that fairy furry thing.

05:54.732 --> 05:57.368
'Bout time to let childhood
romances go, don't you think?

05:57.468 --> 06:01.939
It's just my key chain, Stan. You sure
you still ain't hangin' on to somethin'?

06:02.039 --> 06:04.642
- Hiya, Sheriff Vogel.
- Evenin', Barb.

06:05.092 --> 06:08.596
- Can I get you men some pie?
- Won't be necessary.

06:08.696 --> 06:10.132
I'd appreciate some.

06:10.997 --> 06:13.101
- Dwayne?
- Thank you, ma'am.

06:13.201 --> 06:15.803
Mr. Dwayne McClaren. How are you, son?

06:15.903 --> 06:18.840
- Okay, sir.
- How's your daddy?

06:18.940 --> 06:21.554
Same pretty much, but he's okay.

06:22.909 --> 06:25.246
Ever tell you 'bout the time
that he saved me

06:25.346 --> 06:29.784
from gettin' whooped by Fred
and George Little back in school?

06:29.884 --> 06:33.719
Made me look like a champ
in front of Celine Towers.

06:38.191 --> 06:39.625
Celine was very pretty.

06:43.897 --> 06:47.134
Gave me the grit
to ask her out after that.

06:47.284 --> 06:49.687
He's a good man.
Pass along my best to him, will you?

06:50.187 --> 06:51.622
Yes, sir.

06:52.022 --> 06:56.558
So, we got ourselves
a video of a murder?

06:56.877 --> 06:58.729
Yes, sir.

06:59.129 --> 07:01.206
All right then.

07:06.703 --> 07:11.259
<i>Hi! Welcome to Cut Bank, Montana,
where the Rockies meet the Plains.</i>

07:11.359 --> 07:14.504

- <i>Get down!</i>

07:36.844 --> 07:38.849
<i>Dwayne!</i>

07:43.840 --> 07:47.709
That, indeed, is the taking
of a human life.

07:49.229 --> 07:51.730
First murder this town has ever seen.

07:56.536 --> 07:59.121
Excuse me just one second.

08:16.038 --> 08:20.393
- You all right, Sheriff Vogel?
- Dinner ain't sittin' well is all.

08:21.295 --> 08:24.015
That was Georgie Wits.

08:24.115 --> 08:26.801
Mailman and beloved town acquaintance.

08:26.901 --> 08:30.436
Hell, I never knew him.
Seemed awfully friendly though.

08:31.688 --> 08:37.359
I'll have Mimi dub a copy
for Mrs. Margaret tomorrow first thing.

09:02.452 --> 09:06.424
- Sorry.
- My shift ends at 9:00.

09:06.524 --> 09:10.077
- Put us in for overtime.
- Any more of this, and I quit.

09:12.829 --> 09:15.197
You're almost out.

11:28.865 --> 11:31.133
Damn thing suits you better
than it does me.

11:35.005 --> 11:37.473
Match, look at your face!

11:39.475 --> 11:40.843
You're afraid.

11:42.946 --> 11:47.482
Match, give it up!
It was a joke, okay? I'm sorry!

11:49.185 --> 11:53.191
I didn't mean to burn you.
Does that hurt?

11:53.291 --> 11:58.326
Jesus, practice a little self-control.
Get a grip.

11:59.395 --> 12:04.099
We're 15 miles from town.
Nobody gonna see us.

12:09.606 --> 12:12.477
Oh, nice. Well, let's just
read each other's minds.

12:12.577 --> 12:14.710
Be pretty short for me to read yours.

12:15.745 --> 12:16.942
Money?

12:17.342 --> 12:22.649
Lookit. You want it now, you got it.
Five grand. It's all right here.

12:23.453 --> 12:26.558
Truck make it back to the garage okay?

12:26.658 --> 12:30.058
Very good. Anybody see you?

12:31.127 --> 12:33.929
You cut up the truck pretty good.
Anything left?

12:39.335 --> 12:43.048
Mail? No, no. You were supposed
to torch the mail. You know that.

12:43.148 --> 12:46.577
That was part of the original deal.
I'm sorry, pal. You're not gettin' this.

12:47.303 --> 12:49.479
Jesus.

12:49.579 --> 12:53.417
It's yours, it's yours. I'm not one
to go back on a deal. You know that.

12:53.717 --> 12:56.754
I like you. It's a joke.

12:56.854 --> 12:59.223
God. Give me a hug.

12:59.323 --> 13:00.722
Jesus!

13:07.230 --> 13:09.064
Fuckin' Native.

13:53.609 --> 13:55.446
Wait!

13:55.546 --> 13:57.354
Wait, Dwayne! Wait!

13:58.114 --> 13:59.116
Wait up!

13:59.416 --> 14:01.985
It true about your murder video?

14:02.085 --> 14:04.152
Let me see that thing.

14:05.922 --> 14:09.660
You ought to stop snacking on them Ho Hos,
you got a chance of makin' Pop Warner ball.

14:09.760 --> 14:12.630
- Well, I'm faster than him.
- No, you aren't.

14:12.730 --> 14:14.796
Well, let's see then.

14:17.066 --> 14:19.368
Set. Hut!

14:27.810 --> 14:31.916
I just received the video, and I alerted
Postal Inspection Services immediately.

14:32.716 --> 14:36.353
While it don't feel fittin',
I was just about to watch this.

14:36.453 --> 14:39.054
So if you'll excuse me just a second...

15:03.346 --> 15:06.650
Now, why would someone
do something like that?

15:06.750 --> 15:10.154
Georgie Wits was a nice man. Harmless.

15:10.254 --> 15:12.456
Canadian, even.

15:12.556 --> 15:14.792
What do I need to do?

15:14.892 --> 15:17.258
Oh, I took care of it.

15:17.994 --> 15:21.830
They told me that Postal Inspection Services
should be here before week's end.

15:22.498 --> 15:26.804
This troubles my heart so deeply.
A woman my age ain't meant to carry that.

15:28.667 --> 15:31.036
Okay. Thanks.

15:47.890 --> 15:50.412
Derby Milton.

15:51.494 --> 15:54.598
Your granddaughter ought to take that
insurance confirmation to the post office.

15:54.898 --> 15:58.435
She can get reimbursed for it and make you
a new album at no extra cost.

15:58.835 --> 16:03.240
- A sad condition here that we're wearin'.
- Yeah.

16:03.340 --> 16:05.909
How now!

16:06.009 --> 16:07.642
Derby Milton? That you?

16:08.711 --> 16:11.315
I thought you was dead, son.

16:11.415 --> 16:14.017
You oughta wash
that cabin boy costume more.

16:14.617 --> 16:18.719
Smells like medicines and insects.

16:21.757 --> 16:24.978
Well, Derby.
Ain't you become ever so handsome.

16:25.228 --> 16:26.732
What can I do you for?

16:27.764 --> 16:29.578
I'm...

16:30.801 --> 16:33.036
waiting on a parcel.

16:33.136 --> 16:38.039
You ain't heard? They murdered the mailman.
Out there on Highway 358.

16:39.942 --> 16:41.298
Where's the mail?

16:41.398 --> 16:45.781
They kidnapped it. No sign of Georgie.
No mail. No truck.

16:52.388 --> 16:56.158
It might come tomorrow. I'm sorry.

17:15.178 --> 17:18.448
I promise he'll return
your call, Mrs. Margaret.

17:18.548 --> 17:19.981
No need to keep callin'.

17:22.984 --> 17:25.689
- Mornin', Mimi.
- Sheriff.

17:25.888 --> 17:31.859
Killer is drivin' a dually, so let's run
a search through the D.M.V of the F-350s

17:31.959 --> 17:37.472
and the Chevy and Dodge 3500s in Glacier
and the neighboring counties. What's this?

17:37.572 --> 17:42.039
Department statement. News stations been
callin' all mornin'. Need you to sign it.

17:42.539 --> 17:47.511
What on earth would possess a person
to put six tires on a truck that size?

17:47.611 --> 17:52.180
I can't imagine.
Testosterone, I speculate.

17:53.849 --> 17:55.619
I seen Derby Milton.

17:56.019 --> 17:59.556
Derby Milton?
I didn't know he was still here.

17:59.656 --> 18:01.792
Outside of the post office.

18:01.892 --> 18:06.129
Stopping the mail chases
even the recluses out of the woodwork.

18:06.229 --> 18:09.566
And let's rustle up a list
of the biggest men in the county.

18:10.016 --> 18:12.252
Get a chance and call Mrs. Margaret.

18:12.352 --> 18:16.089
She's been askin' on the progress
of the case all day.

18:16.189 --> 18:19.524
Yeah. And call Mrs. Margaret.

18:52.858 --> 18:55.093
Can't believe it happened on our spot.

18:56.712 --> 19:01.048
Well, not much of a spot.

19:06.422 --> 19:08.592
So you're really getting all that money?

19:09.292 --> 19:12.761
Postal inspector's coming
from the nation's capital to give it to me.

19:14.096 --> 19:17.198
Wow. How much?

19:17.967 --> 19:19.701
A lifetime sum.

19:21.370 --> 19:22.437
Shit.

19:51.368 --> 19:54.035
I signed up for the Miss Cut
Bank pageant.

19:55.271 --> 19:57.841
- Right.
- Hey! I'm gonna win it.

19:57.941 --> 20:01.078
And we're gonna need those $5,000
to make our new life in Butte.

20:01.178 --> 20:03.211
- Butte?
- Yeah!

20:03.746 --> 20:06.049
Don't sell yourself short, hummingbird.

20:06.149 --> 20:08.452
The money I'm getting,
we're moving to California.

20:08.852 --> 20:12.389
- California?
- Yeah. I'll start my own body shop.

20:12.489 --> 20:14.858
Ain't like startin' a business
is easy, dummy.

20:14.958 --> 20:17.861
Hey, I'm good for it. May not know
how they do in the city yet,

20:17.961 --> 20:20.563
but I sure as hell know how to fix cars.

20:20.663 --> 20:22.399
You want me workin' for your daddy
the rest of our lives?

20:22.499 --> 20:24.501
No way.

20:41.717 --> 20:44.321
You know I'll take care of you.

20:45.888 --> 20:47.524
And do whatever it takes.

20:47.874 --> 20:49.724
Yeah.

20:50.659 --> 20:53.730
- I'm proud of you.
- I know.

20:53.830 --> 20:57.397
Me and Miss Cut Bank, chasin' it.

21:09.828 --> 21:14.451
You know my lot out there by the fill bins?
The old junk heap I keep for spare parts?

21:14.551 --> 21:18.886
- Yes, sir.
- I'm sellin' it off to Marty Corcoran.

21:19.755 --> 21:21.958
If I may, sir,
that place is a gold mine.

21:22.058 --> 21:25.062
Neither me or you or Match or none
of us has been out there in years

21:25.162 --> 21:27.931
for it to be worth the taxes I cough up.

21:28.031 --> 21:31.302
Marty's priced it at a mean dollar.
Way more than it oughta get.

21:31.402 --> 21:34.905
So I'm promoting you out there to forage
for the parts that we can clean up

21:35.005 --> 21:38.070
and use it to shop till the deal's done.

21:40.509 --> 21:42.143
So where the hell was Match today?

21:43.579 --> 21:45.849
You know how unreliable Match is.

21:45.949 --> 21:48.985
Well, you gotta learn to take responsibility
for your colleagues.

21:49.385 --> 21:51.252
It's the first lesson of leadership.

23:46.569 --> 23:49.139
What in fuckin' hell are you up to here?

23:49.239 --> 23:51.858
Dwayne! I just had a heart attack.

23:51.958 --> 23:55.610
- I thought you were the God-forbid.
- I am the God-forbid.

23:57.546 --> 23:59.816
Big Stan's turning his head
to make a dollar off the lot.

23:59.916 --> 24:02.285
He's gonna be passin' by
with Marty Corcoran.

24:02.385 --> 24:04.988
And here you are off in the land of nod

24:05.088 --> 24:08.124
with the jazzy playin'
and beer cans all about.

24:08.224 --> 24:10.227
You gotta be the most fat-headed ass.

24:10.527 --> 24:13.964
Whitefish Marty Corcoran? Huge prick.

24:14.264 --> 24:16.566
What the fuck you doin'
loading live rounds?

24:17.066 --> 24:19.202
Protection.

24:19.302 --> 24:23.640
Could you please not point
my own goddamn hand cannon at me?

24:23.740 --> 24:26.474
I have heart problems, Dwayne.

24:29.445 --> 24:31.946
Big Stan's got me foragin'
for parts in the mean.

24:33.382 --> 24:37.420
Well, that's consolation.
We can play us off okay.

24:37.620 --> 24:40.156
That ain't any consolation, Georgie.

24:40.256 --> 24:43.226
That's a fuckin' monkey wrench
grabbin' ahold of my innards.

24:43.326 --> 24:47.331
You gotta be on point.
Lock the damn gate. Stick to the plan.

24:47.431 --> 24:51.366
Can we take a breath here? Just relax.

24:51.967 --> 24:54.635
My plan, my rules.

24:55.004 --> 24:56.973
You're not gonna fuck this up, Georgie.

24:57.373 --> 24:59.331
Fair enough.

24:59.541 --> 25:02.109
Did you see Mrs. Margaret?

25:02.478 --> 25:04.681
- Yeah.
- And?

25:04.781 --> 25:08.549
- Postal inspector should be here any day.
- That's good.

25:09.585 --> 25:13.955
That gives us a week, tops.
I need you to relax.

25:15.991 --> 25:18.862
Match did not torch the mail.

25:18.962 --> 25:22.063
It's... I know.
It's still in the garage.

25:23.866 --> 25:28.104
I can't do it. I need to be seen workin'.
That's on you, mailman. You're dead.

25:28.204 --> 25:29.473
But you're alive,

25:29.873 --> 25:35.009
and I can't afford to be seen
not dead. So you do it.

25:36.678 --> 25:39.180
God to honest, Georgie.
You keep this place tidy.

25:40.182 --> 25:42.817
No beer cans. No lights.

25:44.453 --> 25:47.355
Am I still the only one
with the number to your prepaid?

25:51.960 --> 25:53.795
Great.

25:55.497 --> 25:57.990
I'll call you if whatever.

26:54.990 --> 26:58.259
Hello. They got me in from Shelby
runnin' the routes.

26:58.994 --> 27:02.566
Sure you ain't got a parcel for me?

27:02.666 --> 27:05.232
Yep. Nothin'.

27:25.787 --> 27:26.923
Good mornin', Mimi.

27:27.023 --> 27:31.027
Give me five bills on Tom's Creek
within the spread.

27:31.127 --> 27:33.530
And tell me how Lester's kid's
been pitching.

27:33.630 --> 27:36.966
There's a postal inspector
from the capital here to visit with you.

27:37.066 --> 27:39.803
Nation's capital? What's that?

27:39.903 --> 27:41.738
A list of the county's largest men.

27:41.838 --> 27:45.925
- Jesus Christ! Thirty-five already?
- Did he just take the Lord's name?

27:46.075 --> 27:48.543
Depends on how fat he is.
I mean, really fat?

27:49.811 --> 27:51.981
Really?

27:52.081 --> 27:53.917
Really?

27:54.017 --> 27:57.420
It's like baby Babe Ruth
kind of a thing?

27:57.520 --> 28:00.421
Well, then I want a grand
on Lester's team.

28:01.190 --> 28:03.159
What do you think this is,
arts and crafts?

28:03.259 --> 28:06.794
It's Little League baseball, Oly.
Tell him to sack up!

28:08.164 --> 28:11.101
So, I was told that this is
the coldest town in the nation,

28:11.201 --> 28:15.437
and yet I'm sweating
like a whore in church.

28:15.537 --> 28:17.407
Temperature moderates in summer.

28:17.507 --> 28:20.443
- Have you had lunch yet?
- Forgot it again at home.

28:20.543 --> 28:23.813
What is the best steakhouse you got?
I need a beer.

28:24.313 --> 28:26.933
- There you go, fellas.
- Thank you, darlin'.

28:27.183 --> 28:29.553
For you, and for you.

28:29.653 --> 28:31.588
Yes. Thank you, darling.

28:31.688 --> 28:34.591
United States Postal Inspector
Joe Barret. It's a pleasure.

28:34.691 --> 28:37.160
Oh. It's a pleasure to meet ya.

28:37.260 --> 28:41.128
Okay. Enjoy, Sheriff Vogel,
Inspector Joe.

28:48.170 --> 28:50.071
Appreciate understated establishments.

28:51.173 --> 28:55.376
Best meals always found
in the unlikeliest of places, right?

28:59.014 --> 29:02.118
Best fuckin' steak I ever had?

29:02.218 --> 29:03.386
This one.

29:03.786 --> 29:06.053
Harvey's known to be a grill master.

29:08.790 --> 29:13.330
I hear right, you're competin'
in this year's Miss Cut Bank pageant?

29:14.130 --> 29:17.534
Bet you didn't know I was Miss Cut Bank.

29:17.634 --> 29:19.502
Yep.

29:20.602 --> 29:22.272
1987.

29:22.672 --> 29:24.508
What?

29:25.108 --> 29:27.695
And I'm telling you this 'cause...

29:27.795 --> 29:31.548
well, between you and me,
you got real good chances of winnin'.

29:32.148 --> 29:33.116
Yeah?

29:33.216 --> 29:35.758
Be one of the most important days
you'll ever live.

29:35.958 --> 29:37.921
Speaking of which,
I got this thing back home.

29:38.021 --> 29:39.889
In our nation's capital?

29:39.989 --> 29:42.225
Bethesda. It's the neighbor town.

29:42.325 --> 29:44.627
Anyway, this thing...

29:44.727 --> 29:47.597
- Do you have kids, Sheriff Vogel?
- No, sir.

29:47.697 --> 29:49.265
Well...

29:49.365 --> 29:53.103
Please. You're the sheriff,
I'm the inspector. We're two of the same.

29:53.203 --> 29:55.237
You call me Joe, I call you...

29:55.337 --> 29:57.707
Sheriff Vogel.

29:57.807 --> 30:01.678
- That a first and last name?
- Just my name.

30:02.178 --> 30:06.582
- Have I offended you somehow, Sheriff?
- No, sir... Joe.

30:06.682 --> 30:09.818
If I seem wooden, it's only because
I'm havin' a little trouble

30:09.918 --> 30:11.988
understanding what your purpose
is here, Joe.

30:12.088 --> 30:14.891
I got a town full of concerned citizens

30:14.991 --> 30:19.029
and a puzzle of a case that needs fittin'
the pieces together.

30:19.129 --> 30:22.966
So, you know, I got big-time duties
I got to get back to.

30:23.366 --> 30:25.301
I'll be brief.

30:25.401 --> 30:29.375
I got this engagement back home top
of the week. Once-in-a-year kind of a thing.

30:29.475 --> 30:31.329
- Sounds pressing.
- Indeed.

30:31.779 --> 30:34.878
Service heard there's a videotape of one
of their employees getting murdered,

30:34.978 --> 30:39.315
sent me out here to pass along
a large reward to the creator of said video.

30:39.415 --> 30:42.040
My hope is that you and I
work together expeditiously,

30:42.140 --> 30:47.233
get this deal done, so we can all get back
to our pressing matters. What sayest?

30:48.157 --> 30:50.994
Reasonable man. I do like you,
Sheriff Vogel. Really, I do.

30:51.094 --> 30:54.130
- Have you seen the video?
- Yes, sir... Joe.

30:54.230 --> 30:56.097
Does your mailman get murdered in it?

30:58.266 --> 30:59.902
Evidence for a court.

31:00.002 --> 31:05.508
All I need is to see the mailman's
dead body, and we are set.

31:05.608 --> 31:10.845
I'm at the Glacier Gateway Inn,
and this has been a pleasure.

31:49.451 --> 31:51.821
Excuse me, Mr. Match.

31:51.921 --> 31:54.055
We were wonderin' if you can be "it."

32:03.699 --> 32:05.032
He's counting!

32:25.254 --> 32:28.422
Say. Ain't you Derby Milton?

32:31.359 --> 32:34.094
Ain't this somethin'?
I... I thought you was dead.

32:36.531 --> 32:39.100
I can help you with that.

32:41.403 --> 32:45.221
I remember. You was always quiet.

32:46.609 --> 32:48.861
Really smart too.

32:49.978 --> 32:51.848
Derby Milton.

32:52.660 --> 32:54.083
Come to think,

32:54.383 --> 32:57.451
I ain't seen you since you was workin'
at the national park.

33:03.191 --> 33:06.129
You have these in a bigger size?

33:06.802 --> 33:10.698
What do you need a bigger size for?
Say you're a... nine?

33:12.534 --> 33:15.505
Besides, we don't carry
anything above a 14.

33:15.605 --> 33:18.441
Anybody buy a bigger size of these?

33:20.241 --> 33:23.611
That's an odd thing to ask.
Why are you askin'?

33:27.148 --> 33:31.788
We'd have to special order a shoe
of that size in from the manufacturer.

33:32.388 --> 33:35.523
Well... we haven't.

33:38.660 --> 33:41.529
Well, let me check
with our sister store in Browning.

34:07.556 --> 34:11.425
Native on the reservation ordered
a size 16 'bout seven months ago.

34:13.061 --> 34:15.098
Thank you.

34:15.498 --> 34:19.233
So... taking you don't
need the nines, or...

35:02.010 --> 35:05.101
Perhaps you can show me the mail truck.

35:17.893 --> 35:20.763
Parcel in there belongs to me.

35:20.863 --> 35:23.397
Perhaps you saw it.

35:30.305 --> 35:36.610
Perhaps your... accomplices may know
where I can find my parcel.

36:01.475 --> 36:04.840
I would appreciate if you told me...

36:05.140 --> 36:08.976
where I can find my parcel.

37:11.109 --> 37:13.376
Hi. My name is Cassandra Steely,

37:13.476 --> 37:18.202
and I think I'd make a great
Miss Cut Bank because...

37:19.343 --> 37:22.983
<i>Ain't no mountain high,
ain't no valley low</i>

37:23.083 --> 37:26.988
<i>Ain't no river wide enough, baby</i>

37:27.088 --> 37:30.785
<i>If you need me call me
no matter where you are</i>

37:30.885 --> 37:34.326
<i>No matter how far, don't worry baby</i>

37:34.426 --> 37:37.013
<i>Just call my name...</i>

37:37.113 --> 37:38.882
Hey!

37:40.828 --> 37:45.241
- I keep running into you, Sheriff Vogel.
- Don't it seem? Pretty good.

37:45.341 --> 37:48.611
Oh, thanks. Only space
that's wide enough like a stage,

37:48.711 --> 37:50.479
so I've been practicing my dance.

37:50.579 --> 37:54.308
Well, the bit I saw looked
blue ribbon to me. Your daddy in?

37:54.408 --> 37:57.119
- No, he's not. You try his cell?
- Ain't pickin' up.

37:57.519 --> 38:00.289
Oh. Must be with a client.
He never picks up when he's with clients.

38:00.389 --> 38:04.425
Yeah. Just wanted to inquire about a truck.
I'll see him when I do.

38:05.627 --> 38:09.454
You know, Dwayne's out back.
Maybe he can help ya.

38:09.554 --> 38:13.267
Okay. Well... keep doin'
what you're doin'.

38:16.270 --> 38:19.975
- How's the investigation?
- Oh, comin' along.

38:20.075 --> 38:22.278
I sure feel okay with you on it.

38:22.378 --> 38:25.548
And Dwayne...
he thinks of you like a daddy, so...

38:25.648 --> 38:29.227
Just thanks for what you're doin'.

38:29.718 --> 38:32.473
Good luck with your dancin'.

38:34.422 --> 38:35.789
Hiya, Dwayne.

38:37.058 --> 38:39.295
Sheriff Vogel.

38:39.395 --> 38:41.664
Pretty slow business today.

38:41.764 --> 38:46.435
We're closed. Steeley's got me
at the junk lot foragin' for usable parts.

38:46.535 --> 38:51.040
- Fixin' to sell the lot to Marty Corcoran.
- Whitefish Marty Corcoran. Good fella.

38:51.140 --> 38:54.043
Had a question for your boss.
Maybe you can help me with it.

38:54.445 --> 38:55.685
Sure.

38:55.785 --> 38:59.880
Do you remember seein' around here
a dually 'bout the size of an F-350?

39:02.584 --> 39:05.945
Used to have a truck like that back
when we towed, but that was...

39:06.045 --> 39:07.387
five, six years ago.

39:09.458 --> 39:12.826
- Steeley gave it away.
- You know who he gave it to?

39:14.195 --> 39:15.562
No. Sorry.

39:18.399 --> 39:21.737
- You work here alone?
- Me and the Native.

39:21.837 --> 39:24.941
The Native... What's his name?

39:25.441 --> 39:29.178
- Match.
- Match. Match what?

39:30.511 --> 39:32.042
Tasunke.

39:32.142 --> 39:34.483
Match Tasunke.

39:34.583 --> 39:36.385
Where is he today?

39:36.485 --> 39:38.821
Ain't seen him since a few days back.

39:39.321 --> 39:43.459
By the way, I had lunch today
with that postal inspector from D.C.,

39:43.559 --> 39:46.612
and he wants to meet you,
but I gotta find the body first.

39:46.712 --> 39:48.864
Then you'll be set.

39:48.964 --> 39:51.331
The body?

39:58.006 --> 39:59.933
Match Tasunke?

41:03.304 --> 41:06.225
Mr. Tasunke? Police.

41:06.425 --> 41:09.311
<i>Hello. No one is available
to take your call.</i>

41:09.411 --> 41:12.872
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

41:53.821 --> 41:55.389
It's a swell property.

42:04.766 --> 42:06.933
Let's deal inside.

42:09.704 --> 42:11.405
Step right in, Marty.

42:12.507 --> 42:14.977
Jesus H.

42:15.077 --> 42:18.587
Oh, come on. Kid doesn't appreciate
vintage when he sees it.

42:18.687 --> 42:20.883
Certainly appreciates that funny nectar.

42:21.483 --> 42:24.184
I'm sorry about the state
around here, Marty.

42:41.102 --> 42:43.205
It's all about the structure, you know?
The property.

42:43.305 --> 42:45.472
- That's the important thing.
- Jesus.

42:47.441 --> 42:49.595
Jesus.

42:55.116 --> 42:57.918
- Get back to ya.
- Right.

42:58.686 --> 42:59.913
It's good seein' you.

43:00.756 --> 43:02.524
- Dwayne.
- Mr. Corcoran.

43:02.624 --> 43:06.192
- Well, give my best to Sherry, will you?
- Bet ya.

43:11.499 --> 43:13.068
What the hell's going on here?

43:13.168 --> 43:16.705
I come with my prospective buyer,
and you make me out to be an imbecile.

43:16.805 --> 43:20.743
All the blinds are shut, there's enough
beer cans over there for a three-day binge,

43:20.843 --> 43:23.549
phonograph turnin'.
Looks like a hobo camp in here.

43:23.649 --> 43:25.653
- Won't happen again, sir.
- You're damn right!

43:26.203 --> 43:29.318
Give thanks I don't
turn you to unemployment, kid.

43:29.418 --> 43:32.288
- Is your brow sweatin'?
- No, sir.

43:32.388 --> 43:34.890
Look me in the eye
when I'm talkin' to you.

43:34.990 --> 43:37.960
I've been cleaning them parts
like you said.

43:38.679 --> 43:41.134
I'm sorry about the beer.

43:41.234 --> 43:42.596
I'm on to you.

43:47.168 --> 43:49.071
What are you talking about?

43:49.171 --> 43:51.926
Of all the places
you can point a camera,

43:52.026 --> 43:56.625
you point it at a money-makin' crime.
Now, that's downright lucky,

43:56.725 --> 43:59.581
and lucky don't run in your blood.
You and me both know that.

43:59.781 --> 44:02.951
It'd take perfect execution to pull off
that kinda ploy, and I ain't smart for that.

44:03.051 --> 44:06.159
Your squirrelly ass don't wanna know
what'll happen if you stick around.

44:07.421 --> 44:12.125
You abused my trust.
I thought better of you.

44:13.262 --> 44:14.566
Now get outta here.

44:14.666 --> 44:16.630
- Big Stan...
- Get!

44:17.767 --> 44:19.994
I'm pretty goddamned
disappointed in you!

44:20.194 --> 44:22.969
You stay out of my face!
Don't make me tell you again.

44:35.216 --> 44:37.784
Now who do we have here?

44:42.623 --> 44:45.227
What, are you tweeked
on some drugs or something?

44:45.327 --> 44:47.429
Get out of there!

44:47.529 --> 44:49.398
- Come on! Get out!
- Oh, geez.

44:49.498 --> 44:51.537
Get out of there!

44:55.770 --> 44:58.271
Georgie Wits?

45:01.442 --> 45:02.597
Me?

46:07.841 --> 46:09.719
You mind givin' us a minute?

46:09.819 --> 46:11.413
I'm done here at 9:00.

46:12.213 --> 46:15.982
I got events under way
that are makin' my time difficult.

46:16.584 --> 46:19.452
I'd appreciate if you'd draw your line
in the sand some other time.

46:26.527 --> 46:28.780
I need privacy.

46:49.117 --> 46:53.152
I got somethin' on my chest,
and I'm just gonna say it, if it's okay.

46:55.656 --> 46:58.624
I know how hard this will be on you.

47:03.230 --> 47:07.066
That business you seen on the news
about the mailman...

47:09.904 --> 47:12.938
I set everyone up on that.

47:13.674 --> 47:15.741
I did it.

47:17.578 --> 47:19.645
And I'm sorry.

47:23.951 --> 47:27.987
I never wanted to let you down,
but I wanted you to know in honest.

47:33.227 --> 47:35.061
I ruined everything.

47:36.731 --> 47:39.999
I ruined everything, and I'm sorry.

47:42.370 --> 47:44.915
I'm so sorry.

48:39.493 --> 48:42.195
Thought you was dead.

48:57.206 --> 49:00.246
I'm looking for my parcel.

49:01.048 --> 49:03.349
Figure you stoled it.

49:04.085 --> 49:06.339
It was addressed to...

49:06.439 --> 49:09.804
4 Woolly Walnut Trail.

49:09.904 --> 49:12.627
I deliver a package there
every year in June.

49:12.727 --> 49:16.562
You know how many flats I've had
trying to get to you?

49:17.698 --> 49:19.632
I know where your package is.

49:21.101 --> 49:24.571
You operate on one really
weird mail cycle.

49:25.673 --> 49:27.742
I...

49:27.842 --> 49:31.146
- I ain't got patience.
- Patience?

49:31.687 --> 49:34.481
Well, that's a fuckin' virtue.
You ought to get it.

49:36.146 --> 49:39.054
Gonna give me hitches like the Indian?

49:39.154 --> 49:41.790
You threatened the Native?

49:42.290 --> 49:44.457
Oh, I'm sure you got a lot out of him.

49:47.962 --> 49:50.399
You know, I... I don't like your tone.

49:50.499 --> 49:55.337
That's... That shit you're doing
with the... crowbar there...

49:55.437 --> 49:58.304
and your tone, I don't like it.

49:59.306 --> 50:03.778
And you think you're gonna come threaten me
and pry your package out of me?

50:04.078 --> 50:06.281
Well, that's real fuckin' clever.

50:06.681 --> 50:09.685
You know what? I'm starting to think
that you might be an asshole.

50:09.785 --> 50:11.787
It doesn't have to be like that.

50:11.887 --> 50:15.891
You can talk to me like a civilized
fucking human being.

50:15.991 --> 50:19.168
Just want my parcel.

50:19.794 --> 50:23.832
Well, you know what? Fuck you.

50:24.437 --> 50:28.370
I got news for you.
Your way ain't the way shit works.

50:28.470 --> 50:33.085
You can't just come up here and prance in
anytime you want and knock me around

50:33.185 --> 50:35.076
on your own agenda.

50:35.176 --> 50:38.313
I got my own agenda.

50:38.413 --> 50:40.315
But does anybody respect it?

50:40.715 --> 50:42.851
No way, José.

50:42.951 --> 50:45.957
You're the virus of my job.

50:46.754 --> 50:50.023
A forest-child fuckin' mongoloid.

50:51.025 --> 50:53.261
What? You want me to smile at you...

50:53.561 --> 50:56.498
like a happy fucking mailman?

50:56.598 --> 50:59.334
Oh, creepy fuck nuts,

50:59.434 --> 51:03.538
thank you so much
for showing me your shiny lever.

51:03.638 --> 51:08.043
Well, for me, all day long it's... "Howdy,
ma'am. How are you? Here's your mail.

51:08.143 --> 51:10.212
Say hi to the kids for me."

51:10.312 --> 51:13.412
I got pleasantries demanded of me,

51:13.512 --> 51:15.183
I say fuck it.

51:15.883 --> 51:17.700
And fuck them.

51:17.800 --> 51:20.170
And fuck you!

51:35.904 --> 51:39.541
I'm sorry. I was kidding.

51:39.641 --> 51:41.443
It was a joke.

51:41.643 --> 51:44.844
I mean, I don't know much.
It was the other guy all the way.

51:44.944 --> 51:49.117
It was his plan, not mine. Come on,
we're friends, man. We're friends.

51:49.217 --> 51:54.453
I mean, it was... it was Dwayne.
Come on, it's... We're... we're friends.

53:15.969 --> 53:19.574
- Sheriff Vogel?
- Just the man I needed to see.

53:19.674 --> 53:22.544
- I need to talk to you.
- Did you see Big Stan?

53:22.844 --> 53:25.013
- Yeah.
- Did you tell him I needed a word with him?

53:25.113 --> 53:27.232
- I didn't get a chance to get a word...
- When did you see him?

53:28.816 --> 53:33.130
Midday. He was... transacting a deal
with Marty Corcoran at the junk lot.

53:33.230 --> 53:35.570
I figured. I couldn't
get ahold of him at all.

53:35.670 --> 53:39.091
- Sir, I...
- You know what I seen today?

53:39.393 --> 53:42.195
Match Tasunke murdered in his own home.

53:44.664 --> 53:48.901
This must be the most disappointing
day of my entire life.

53:50.037 --> 53:51.539
Match is dead?

53:51.639 --> 53:54.943
Murdered. Second murder on this case.

53:55.043 --> 53:57.946
First murder I seen in person.

53:58.046 --> 54:02.382
I'm sorry, son. I should have delivered
that news more kindly.

54:04.351 --> 54:07.251
And Mrs. Steeley calls.
She's worried stiff

54:07.351 --> 54:10.959
'cause she hasn't heard from her husband
all day, and he didn't come home tonight.

54:11.059 --> 54:12.727
Don't mention that to Cassandra,

54:12.827 --> 54:17.196
'cause these things tend
to turn out quiet more often than not.

54:18.599 --> 54:25.005
Listen, I want you to take Cassandra
out tonight, show her a good time...

54:25.105 --> 54:28.275
with her mother's blessing.

54:28.375 --> 54:30.852
- Okay? Can I trust you?
- No, sir. I can't.

54:30.952 --> 54:34.513
Take it. You're good for it.

54:35.049 --> 54:38.785
And if you're not, I know
where to find you. Go on, son.

54:40.020 --> 54:43.923
I'm gonna go off to have a poke
around Big Stan's junk lot.

55:26.033 --> 55:28.669
Hello. This is Jorry's.

55:28.769 --> 55:30.704
Hello?

55:31.905 --> 55:35.176
Next time you want to do double
or nothin', Kenny, I am right here.

56:55.388 --> 56:59.366
<i>We were born before the wind</i>

57:01.778 --> 57:05.601
<i>Also younger than the sun</i>

57:07.970 --> 57:13.172
<i>Ere the bonnie boat was won
as we sailed into the mystic</i>

57:18.214 --> 57:22.470
<i>Hark, now hear the sailors cry</i>

57:24.401 --> 57:28.965
<i>Smell the sea and feel the sky</i>

57:29.493 --> 57:33.595
Looks like the fella pried
at the collarbone. Used some sort of jimmy.

57:34.447 --> 57:35.997
Wasn't enough just to shoot him?

57:36.097 --> 57:39.015
What'd they torture Georgie for?

57:40.167 --> 57:41.907
My little hustler.

57:42.007 --> 57:45.394
<i>And when that fog horn blows</i>

57:45.894 --> 57:48.920
<i>I will be coming home</i>

57:49.020 --> 57:51.254
I gotta sit.

58:00.600 --> 58:01.607
Dwayne.

58:01.856 --> 58:05.693
- You good?
- Yeah. What's happened? Turn that up.

58:05.793 --> 58:09.129
<i>Georgie Wits has indeed
been confirmed dead.</i>

58:09.229 --> 58:11.866
<i>His body was discovered
at a derelict junk lot...</i>

58:11.966 --> 58:15.235
- <i>...on the outskirts of Cut Bank.</i>
- Y'all remember?

58:15.335 --> 58:17.972
- <i>We've yet to receive an official statement.</i>
- I love you.

58:18.072 --> 58:22.110
<i>But what I can tell you is
that the mood here is certainly somber.</i>

58:22.710 --> 58:25.918
- <i>Thank you for that special report.</i>
- Well, I'll be damned.

58:26.318 --> 58:29.415
- They found Georgie Wits.
- We got to go.

58:30.083 --> 58:31.150
Come on.

58:34.821 --> 58:38.092
He'll be in the freezer till the medical
examiner gets back from Great Falls.

58:38.192 --> 58:40.995
- When the fuck's that happening?
- Figure on Monday.

58:41.095 --> 58:42.163
Goddamn it.

58:42.563 --> 58:45.116
So... So I get my death
certificate then?

58:45.766 --> 58:51.339
Georgie Wits appears tortured and dead
right here on Big Stan's plot

58:51.439 --> 58:54.375
while Big Stan up and disappears.

58:54.475 --> 58:56.811
And that ain't a puzzle to you?

58:56.911 --> 58:59.344
Who the fuck's Big Stan?

58:59.913 --> 59:01.647
Sheriff Vogel, I got somethin'.

59:12.726 --> 59:14.562
Who's that?

59:14.662 --> 59:17.196
That's Big Stan.

59:23.169 --> 59:25.171
We got to leave town tonight.

59:27.240 --> 59:29.308
There's a man on a rampage
huntin' people.

59:30.711 --> 59:34.046
He killed Georgie. He killed Match.
Now he's comin' after me.

59:35.715 --> 59:39.084
Now or never, no lookin' back.
Can you do that?

59:42.189 --> 59:44.690
Baby, he's gonna kill me.

59:47.861 --> 59:50.681
- I been callin' and callin'! We gotta go!
- What?

59:50.781 --> 59:54.333
He ain't woke up yet,
but he's alive. Come on.

01:00:12.485 --> 01:00:14.987
What, you make a habit
out of cowin' girls like that?

01:00:22.162 --> 01:00:25.964
Now, Milton boy.

01:00:27.734 --> 01:00:30.171
Derby.

01:00:30.271 --> 01:00:32.104
Derby Milton.

01:00:33.673 --> 01:00:35.908
I should see the other hombre, right?

01:00:39.546 --> 01:00:42.984
- Dwayne McClaren here?
- Took off with his girlie.

01:00:43.584 --> 01:00:47.452
God knows what they're doin'
and where they're doin' it.

01:00:48.155 --> 01:00:51.790
You know she's competin'
in the Miss Cut Bank pageant tomorrow?

01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:57.228
You remember me
when I was Miss Cut Bank?

01:00:57.731 --> 01:01:02.770
I remember you sitting up there
in the third row

01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:07.358
watchin' me with those cute
little pencil-head eyes.

01:01:07.458 --> 01:01:11.243
I bet you were undressin' me
in your head.

01:01:19.186 --> 01:01:21.253
Closed.

01:01:22.989 --> 01:01:25.580
We're closed.

01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:28.429
Hey, aren't you
that twitchy fuckin' recluse?

01:01:28.529 --> 01:01:33.134
Easy, Harvey. Derby Milton
ain't nothin' but gentlemanly.

01:01:33.234 --> 01:01:36.143
I asked you a question, boy.

01:01:38.338 --> 01:01:40.406
Hey, where are you goin'?

01:02:01.995 --> 01:02:06.934
So, the Dwayne McClaren.

01:02:07.034 --> 01:02:09.775
Got you a piece of peach cobbler.

01:02:09.875 --> 01:02:11.289
Little known fact...

01:02:11.389 --> 01:02:15.608
the best cobblers in the world
are found in hospital food courts.

01:02:17.310 --> 01:02:19.044
You're not gonna eat all that, are you?

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:29.340
U.S.P.I. Joe Barret.

01:02:29.890 --> 01:02:31.292
Congratulations, kid.

01:02:31.792 --> 01:02:34.262
I send you your check as soon as
the sheriff does his paperwork.

01:02:34.362 --> 01:02:37.281
Shouldn't be more
than a few months or so.

01:02:37.381 --> 01:02:41.269
- I thought it was immediate.
- Nothing's immediate in this life...

01:02:41.369 --> 01:02:42.870
except self-stimulation,

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:45.955
and even that sometimes,
you know, takes a little patience.

01:02:47.690 --> 01:02:51.960
Damn. This is the best
fucking cobbler I ever had.

01:02:52.229 --> 01:02:54.424
Can I give you a forwarding address?

01:02:54.524 --> 01:02:56.927
I don't see why not.

01:02:58.501 --> 01:03:00.436
What's the capital like?

01:03:02.105 --> 01:03:06.277
Dirty, stressful, angry,

01:03:06.377 --> 01:03:09.965
lonely, corrupt and expensive.

01:03:10.065 --> 01:03:12.814
- And you like it?
- I love it.

01:03:15.118 --> 01:03:16.385
Thank you, sir.

01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:19.788
I'll be in touch.

01:03:31.901 --> 01:03:34.869
He's still unconscious.

01:03:42.846 --> 01:03:44.641
We're not getting the money.

01:03:46.483 --> 01:03:47.449
What?

01:03:48.318 --> 01:03:50.045
Not for a few months.

01:03:53.656 --> 01:03:56.555
I have to win the pageant then.

01:03:56.655 --> 01:03:58.212
Dwayne, we can't leave till after.

01:04:07.771 --> 01:04:10.105
We'll stay here
with Big Steeley tonight.

01:04:17.814 --> 01:04:20.251
<i>Harvey called in
from Jorry's late night.</i>

01:04:20.351 --> 01:04:22.820
Drunk brawl's his problem.

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:26.704
<i>He's saying Derby Milton come in
after closing lookin' to whoop.</i>

01:04:26.804 --> 01:04:29.860
<i>Harvey wants his due redressal.</i>

01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:32.511
Derby Milton?

01:04:33.096 --> 01:04:37.716
I'll see to it before I come in today.
Thanks much, Mimi.

01:04:55.919 --> 01:04:59.590
We, the people, in order to form
a more perfect union...

01:05:01.492 --> 01:05:04.025
Dry them tears.

01:05:05.228 --> 01:05:07.475
Look at me.

01:05:11.868 --> 01:05:13.882
Hummingbird,

01:05:14.582 --> 01:05:15.838
you're ready.

01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:19.910
It just don't feel right
with everything and whatnot.

01:05:20.410 --> 01:05:22.346
We just seen him.

01:05:22.446 --> 01:05:24.949
Nurse said he'll wake up soon enough
and he'll be A-plus.

01:05:25.356 --> 01:05:27.449
Okay?

01:06:05.088 --> 01:06:09.157
Derby Milton, Sheriff Vogel.
Just need a word.

01:06:32.949 --> 01:06:34.661
Derby Milton?

01:06:55.972 --> 01:06:58.275
Hi. My name's Cassandra Steeley.

01:06:58.375 --> 01:07:02.477
And I think I'd make a great
Miss Cut Bank because...

01:07:02.577 --> 01:07:05.363
<i>Listen, baby</i>

01:07:05.463 --> 01:07:09.109
<i>Ain't no mountain high,
ain't no valley low</i>

01:07:09.209 --> 01:07:13.044
<i>Ain't no river wide enough, baby</i>

01:07:13.144 --> 01:07:16.820
<i>If you need me call me
no matter where you are</i>

01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:18.638
<i>No matter how far...</i>

01:08:18.233 --> 01:08:22.122
So, what's this secret business
you got with Derby Milton?

01:08:23.059 --> 01:08:25.863
He stopped by Jorry's after hours
last night askin' about you.

01:08:26.863 --> 01:08:29.417
Whooped up on Harvey real good.

01:09:06.669 --> 01:09:08.872
Freeze! On the ground!

01:09:08.973 --> 01:09:11.537
On the ground!

01:12:00.509 --> 01:12:04.079
Your daddy used to carry
that rifle with him every day.

01:12:06.282 --> 01:12:08.806
You look like him.

01:12:10.819 --> 01:12:11.887
Chamber's empty.

01:12:31.674 --> 01:12:34.244
This six-shooter familiar to you?

01:12:35.244 --> 01:12:36.912
Why are you huntin' me now?

01:12:38.314 --> 01:12:41.749
Huntin' for my parcel.

01:12:46.255 --> 01:12:49.581
Spent last night sittin' right here.

01:12:51.327 --> 01:12:53.138
Orson and me

01:12:53.238 --> 01:12:57.810
used to be colleagues.

01:12:58.267 --> 01:13:00.337
Oh, yeah?

01:13:00.537 --> 01:13:05.576
Both us worked at the national park.

01:13:06.413 --> 01:13:10.211
- Never knew he left town.
- He did.

01:13:10.613 --> 01:13:13.016
Two summers.

01:13:13.116 --> 01:13:17.052
That rifle got me thinkin'
on a time then.

01:13:18.387 --> 01:13:20.591
And then one mornin',

01:13:20.691 --> 01:13:25.206
Orson here finds
the lodge kitchen a mess.

01:13:26.429 --> 01:13:32.199
Seems a mama bear
broke in lookin' for supper.

01:13:33.002 --> 01:13:35.069
Same night...

01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:40.978
her two babies find the dumpster...

01:13:41.078 --> 01:13:44.812
and climb on in for a feast.

01:13:45.314 --> 01:13:48.816
I remember that mornin' clearly.

01:13:49.451 --> 01:13:53.993
Ranger decided
mama had crossed the line.

01:13:55.091 --> 01:14:00.160
Become a threat to public safety.

01:14:02.798 --> 01:14:06.570
Ranger and me and Orson picked 'em up,

01:14:06.670 --> 01:14:12.164
take 'em into the woods
like normal. But this time, the...

01:14:12.964 --> 01:14:17.549
ranger tells Orson
to get his Winchester.

01:14:20.049 --> 01:14:24.285
Orson says... he can't do it.

01:14:26.722 --> 01:14:29.614
Ranger hands it to me.

01:14:33.497 --> 01:14:36.564
Says, "Babies first."

01:14:48.210 --> 01:14:50.948
Like I was sacrificing a lamb...

01:14:51.048 --> 01:14:54.518
so people could smile on and...

01:14:54.618 --> 01:14:56.486
s...

01:14:56.586 --> 01:14:59.514
snap their photos.

01:15:03.059 --> 01:15:06.396
I ain't been able to see
folks for nothin' but...

01:15:06.496 --> 01:15:11.031
talkin' bobbleheads since.

01:15:14.570 --> 01:15:16.707
And... animals?

01:15:16.807 --> 01:15:20.825
Been keepin' 'em safe from people.

01:15:22.078 --> 01:15:25.012
Preservin' their honesty.

01:15:26.782 --> 01:15:29.302
Started that fall.

01:15:30.252 --> 01:15:33.821
Poacher stumbled upon my place.

01:15:34.590 --> 01:15:36.858
Perturbed me.

01:15:37.859 --> 01:15:42.342
So I snatched his neck.

01:15:45.668 --> 01:15:49.228
I need that parcel.

01:15:49.572 --> 01:15:50.905
Dwayne?

01:15:53.842 --> 01:15:56.978
Are you here? Baby?

01:15:59.482 --> 01:16:01.118
Here you are.

01:16:01.218 --> 01:16:04.293
Where were you? I won!

01:16:05.854 --> 01:16:07.122
Close your eyes.

01:16:11.927 --> 01:16:14.298
You don't see me,

01:16:14.898 --> 01:16:17.461
I don't see you.

01:16:33.449 --> 01:16:36.261
This calms the nerves.

01:16:49.899 --> 01:16:52.801
That'll kill ya.

01:16:54.036 --> 01:16:58.572
You mind if I... out the window?

01:17:07.483 --> 01:17:09.951
You a litterbug?

01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:27.368
She ain't got nothin' to do with this.
She don't know nothin'.

01:17:34.043 --> 01:17:36.177
No more talking.

01:17:47.122 --> 01:17:49.858
Get down. Stay low.

01:17:51.927 --> 01:17:56.096
- We're closed.
- Just need to grab somethin' from 224.

01:17:59.568 --> 01:18:00.735
If you don't mind.

01:18:15.370 --> 01:18:18.253
I'm right here. We're gonna be fine.

01:18:25.894 --> 01:18:28.437
It's okay. It's okay.

01:19:01.697 --> 01:19:03.064
What's inside?

01:19:10.806 --> 01:19:11.840
Nothin'.

01:19:16.705 --> 01:19:19.182
I'm here. We're gonna be fine.

01:19:19.282 --> 01:19:22.984
We're gonna be fine. Okay?
We're gonna be fine.

01:19:26.021 --> 01:19:28.971
You been...

01:19:29.758 --> 01:19:31.422
decent with me.

01:19:48.744 --> 01:19:53.514
I was gonna be... decent back.

01:20:00.222 --> 01:20:01.889
What are you doin'?

01:20:12.875 --> 01:20:16.044
- Hey, you don't have to do that.
- Please.

01:20:16.144 --> 01:20:18.708
Please, please, don't do that.
Don't do that.

01:20:19.666 --> 01:20:22.806
Come on, please. Don't do that.
Don't do that. Please.

01:20:22.906 --> 01:20:25.297
Come on, man. Come on. Come on.

01:20:25.697 --> 01:20:28.782
Listen to me. Listen to me.

01:20:29.684 --> 01:20:32.856
Slow breaths, babe. Slow breaths.
Slow breaths, okay?

01:20:32.956 --> 01:20:36.709
I'm right here. We're gonna be fine.
We're gonna be fine. You're gonna be fine.

01:21:12.827 --> 01:21:16.325
Derby Milton, freeze right there.

01:21:19.134 --> 01:21:23.638
Step out of the car, Derby Milton.
Show me your hands.

01:22:47.089 --> 01:22:50.327
I had a curious dream while I was under.

01:22:50.427 --> 01:22:54.264
I was at our old fishin' hole
from when we were kids.

01:22:54.364 --> 01:22:58.812
It's true about flashing visions
of your life and the pearly gates?

01:22:58.912 --> 01:23:01.170
It wasn't like that.

01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:06.473
I saw that damn rabbit's foot
you're twirlin' around your finger there.

01:23:07.242 --> 01:23:10.277
Could have been any rabbit foot.

01:23:11.847 --> 01:23:16.917
Celine Towers gave you that damn thing
the day she left town for good.

01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:21.691
And she wanted you to go with her,
and you didn't.

01:23:21.791 --> 01:23:25.292
I never could understand why myself.

01:23:26.295 --> 01:23:29.098
I wanted that gesture so bad.

01:23:29.198 --> 01:23:34.468
I wanted Celine to swoop back
into town and take me away.

01:23:36.872 --> 01:23:39.209
And now I'm...

01:23:39.309 --> 01:23:42.673
married with family for nearly 27 years.

01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:47.315
You had your chance.

01:23:50.385 --> 01:23:54.742
I'm figurin' I can't control
the way things change.

01:23:56.525 --> 01:23:59.026
I ought to stop tryin'.

01:24:01.330 --> 01:24:04.098
It seems for the best.

01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:22.783
We got some quick formalities
we need to see to.

01:24:23.818 --> 01:24:28.591
I ain't been down here but twice
in my life. Takes a mean gut.

01:24:28.691 --> 01:24:31.690
There's something I want you to see.

01:24:41.303 --> 01:24:45.074
Nothin' this past week made any sense.

01:24:45.174 --> 01:24:49.445
And then last night,
I woke up with the dumbest epiphany.

01:24:49.545 --> 01:24:52.515
There's your slap-dash video

01:24:52.615 --> 01:24:56.250
of Georgie gettin' two in the chest.

01:24:58.186 --> 01:25:02.025
So if my imagination wanders,
I could piece together a situation

01:25:02.125 --> 01:25:07.194
where this is all part of a ruse gone bad,
what with the reward money and all.

01:25:08.297 --> 01:25:10.834
And folks with that kind
of imagination, I bet,

01:25:10.934 --> 01:25:13.167
could fair well if they stayed honest.

01:25:19.608 --> 01:25:22.643
Slide this under his back.

01:25:32.421 --> 01:25:37.138
I know that I ain't very clever.
My expertise is in the simple.

01:25:37.238 --> 01:25:40.496
And that ain't for everybody either.
Sometimes in life,

01:25:41.396 --> 01:25:43.632
the truth...

01:25:43.732 --> 01:25:47.184
is more than I prefer.

01:25:47.669 --> 01:25:49.739
This is one of those times.

01:25:49.839 --> 01:25:54.243
If you need to leave,
you ought to have left already.

01:25:54.733 --> 01:25:57.088
Waitin' around for lucky money,

01:25:57.188 --> 01:26:01.083
that's for sallies and lazies.

01:26:01.183 --> 01:26:04.719
The price for this, you gonna
be passing on that reward money.

01:26:06.822 --> 01:26:09.915
And I'm firin' you.

01:26:10.625 --> 01:26:14.127
Severance will keep you
afloat for a spell.

01:26:17.365 --> 01:26:20.534
- I'll pay you back, sir.
- You're damn right.

01:26:21.637 --> 01:26:24.340
Me and Roland,
we'll take care of your daddy.

01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:28.677
It's about time you had some family
around here helpin' you out.

01:26:28.777 --> 01:26:31.447
Reckon you wouldn't get this kind
of pass in the big city,

01:26:31.547 --> 01:26:33.514
and you best not ever need it again.

01:26:35.784 --> 01:26:39.453
And not a word to Cassandra about this.

01:26:57.172 --> 01:27:00.740
First time I ever used my vest.

01:27:17.793 --> 01:27:21.795
Overwhelmingly glad to see you.
Oh, there he is.

01:27:23.565 --> 01:27:27.268
- You go ahead, sir.
- Thank you, Sheriff Vogel.

01:27:38.006 --> 01:27:39.980
Wait! Wait!

01:28:18.324 --> 01:28:25.354
<i>It was colder than well digger's ankles
in Cut Bank, Montana</i>

01:28:28.306 --> 01:28:35.427
<i>But my heart was on fire
when I saw her step down from the train</i>

01:28:37.739 --> 01:28:40.828
<i>I'd been up there forever</i>

01:28:40.928 --> 01:28:46.177
<i>But her arms were finally around me</i>

01:28:47.850 --> 01:28:55.313
<i>All my icicles melted away
at the sound of her name</i>

01:28:58.207 --> 01:29:05.508
<i>I held her to me
as tightly as I held her letter</i>

01:29:08.064 --> 01:29:11.126
<i>That said, "I don't love him,</i>

01:29:11.586 --> 01:29:15.632
<i>I'm leaving this cold, mean man"</i>

01:29:17.959 --> 01:29:25.387
<i>As the train pulled away from the platform
and I put her in the wagon</i>

01:29:27.762 --> 01:29:35.061
<i>With her head on my shoulder,
God knows I was one happy man</i>

01:29:38.117 --> 01:29:45.264
<i>And I went to heaven that night
in her arms in my cabin</i>

01:29:47.700 --> 01:29:55.083
<i>In the winter of '94
there burned such a powerful flame</i>

01:29:58.008 --> 01:30:02.634
<i>They still hear her voice in the cabin</i>

01:30:02.734 --> 01:30:06.040
<i>In Cut Bank, Montana</i>

01:30:07.753 --> 01:30:15.011
<i>And the icicles all melt away
at the sound of her name</i>

01:30:17.571 --> 01:30:24.937
<i>Hell rolled into town one night
on a Wyoming stallion</i>

01:30:27.699 --> 01:30:35.253
<i>His heart full of hate
and his eyes full of cold jealousy</i>

01:30:38.371 --> 01:30:40.322
<i>One way or another</i>

01:30:40.422 --> 01:30:44.601
<i>He said partner I'm taking back my woman</i>

01:30:47.144 --> 01:30:50.677
<i>With my hand on my gun
I said don't bet your life</i>

01:30:50.777 --> 01:30:54.787
<i>The lady said she's staying with me</i>

01:30:57.676 --> 01:31:04.815
<i>His knife was a flash in the light
of the kerosene lantern</i>

01:31:07.451 --> 01:31:14.561
<i>That fell as we tangled
and fought in the fire on the floor</i>

01:31:17.794 --> 01:31:24.982
<i>He was a dead man,
but I have been too since I lost her</i>

01:31:27.300 --> 01:31:34.484
<i>From the fire that burned me so bad
as I crawled through the door</i>

01:31:37.467 --> 01:31:44.600
<i>But I went to heaven that night
in her arms in my little cabin</i>

01:31:47.053 --> 01:31:54.234
<i>In the winter of '94
there burned one hell of a flame</i>

01:31:57.532 --> 01:32:01.936
<i>They still hear her voice from the cabin</i>

01:32:02.036 --> 01:32:05.543
<i>In Cut Bank, Montana</i>

01:32:07.111 --> 01:32:14.268
<i>And the icicles all melt away
at the sound of her name</i>

01:32:17.502 --> 01:32:21.968
<i>They still hear her voice from the cabin</i>

01:32:22.068 --> 01:32:25.276
<i>In Cut Bank, Montana</i>

01:32:27.059 --> 01:32:30.687
<i>And the icicles all just melt away</i>

01:32:30.787 --> 01:32:35.870
<i>At the sound of her name</i>
