- Ms. Marks called you

00:06.807 --> 00:08.507
For dating advice, and she made
you touch her breast?

00:08.509 --> 00:10.709
I am not gonna publish this.
- It's all true.

00:10.711 --> 00:13.412
- It's cruel.
- I need to go home.

00:13.414 --> 00:14.446
- See ya.

00:14.448 --> 00:15.881
- Thank you for being my hero.

00:15.883 --> 00:18.817

I ever wanted to be.

[austra's <i>hurt me now]</i>

00:21.522 --> 00:23.088
- Morning had broken,
and so had I,

00:23.090 --> 00:25.824
Because of the choices
I had made under the influence

00:25.826 --> 00:28.093
Of a drug--
collin jennings.

00:28.095 --> 00:29.561
- Against my better judgment,

00:29.563 --> 00:31.263
I had bought into
his propaganda,

00:31.265 --> 00:35.200
And it left me heartbroken,
alone, and humiliated.

00:35.202 --> 00:38.570
I felt left out
in the cold...

00:38.572 --> 00:39.204
- Because I was.

To let me back in the house...
- ♪ oh, don't hurt me now ♪

00:48.215 --> 00:49.281
Which didn't
mean he was ready

00:49.283 --> 00:51.550
To put me back on his
"friends and family" plan.

00:51.552 --> 00:56.555
- ♪ oh, don't hurt me now ♪

00:56.557 --> 00:58.357

no "buts" about it.

00:58.359 --> 01:00.426
I had hit rock bottom.

01:00.428 --> 01:01.560
I wanted my life back.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.862
I knew it wouldn't be
an easy campaign,

01:03.864 --> 01:08.667
But I couldn't make an omelet
without cracking a few eggs.

Fresh pepper?

01:11.439 --> 01:14.006
- Sure.
[chuckles]

01:15.875 --> 01:17.976

Go, jayhawks.

01:21.248 --> 01:22.347

to be working.

01:30.791 --> 01:32.458
If you don't want to live
by our rules,

Then this is
a business relationship,

01:34.829 --> 01:36.695
And you can pay rent.

01:36.697 --> 01:37.096
Oh!

I'll deduct 20 bucks since

I may be your landlord,

Having done nothing
to sway public opinion,

I know you love
that extra vent.

02:02.455 --> 02:03.689
You look pretty.

- Getting a life.

02:13.400 --> 02:16.168
Apparently, I need one.

02:16.170 --> 02:20.005
- Okay, posters up,
banners draped, speech written.

02:20.007 --> 02:21.740
Do you think people will know
I spelled "president"

02:21.742 --> 02:22.474
With a "z" on purpose?

02:22.476 --> 02:24.510
No one's gonna vote for me
if they think I'm a dumbass.

02:24.512 --> 02:27.479

all this in one night.

02:27.481 --> 02:28.547

a great president, t.

You always were a leader.
- Are you being sarcastic?

02:46.600 --> 02:48.901
- Not at all.

02:48.903 --> 02:51.503
Can I wear one?

02:58.511 --> 03:01.313
Well, you both look good.

03:03.883 --> 03:04.416

And adorable,

You're gonna have to fight
for it like everyone else.

You think it was easy for me
to find banner paper

And grommets after 7:00

03:23.370 --> 03:24.970
Crepe paper doesn't

So, if you're done dancing
around the maypole,

03:26.807 --> 03:30.342
It's time to strap on
and play some hardball.

03:30.344 --> 03:34.112
- Okay.
Game on!

03:34.114 --> 03:36.048
Game on.

03:36.050 --> 03:38.517
- More like game off!
- That's not a thing.

03:38.519 --> 03:40.886
- The warm--or rather,
lukewarm--reception

From my peers was a clear sign

03:42.456 --> 03:44.289
My approval rating was
on the rise.

03:44.291 --> 03:47.960
I felt encouraged, inspired,
and like myles mcallmond,

03:47.962 --> 03:50.329
I was determined to run
a clean race.

As a result of my recent trip
down ecstasy lane,

03:57.071 --> 03:58.237
I have conveniently forgotten

03:58.239 --> 04:00.973
The mud-slinging
had already begun,

04:00.975 --> 04:03.976
And I was the one with mud
on my hands.

04:03.978 --> 04:06.245
Mr. Hart, you cannot publish
my essay about val.

04:06.247 --> 04:08.180
You were right, it was cruel,
and when I wrote it,

04:08.182 --> 04:09.114
I was in a bad,
bad place.

04:09.116 --> 04:10.482
But I am no longer
in that place,

04:10.484 --> 04:11.483
So you can just
throw it away,

04:11.485 --> 04:14.052
And I will write something new.
Deal?

04:14.054 --> 04:17.154
- Hart's not here today,
so I'm covering for him.

04:17.156 --> 04:18.991

04:18.993 --> 04:19.891
Again.
- Great!

04:19.892 --> 04:21.627
Not great about his grandma,

04:21.629 --> 04:23.028
Great that I have time
to kill my essay

04:23.030 --> 04:24.463
Before the <i>experior</i> comes out.

04:24.465 --> 04:26.965
That would have been
all over the place.

04:26.967 --> 04:29.601
- Wow, timing on that
couldn't have been better.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.236
- There was
nothing I could do.

04:31.238 --> 04:33.772
The information
had gone public.

04:33.774 --> 04:36.341
I had to warn valerie.

04:49.088 --> 04:51.556
- I need some advice
about getting a life.

04:51.558 --> 04:54.860
I want do something,
be something, go somewhere.

04:54.862 --> 04:59.665
- I cannot tell you how long I
have waited for you to say that!

I have always wanted

05:01.168 --> 05:04.202
To blow this town

05:04.204 --> 05:06.571
Like, take a drive
into a canyon.

05:06.573 --> 05:10.142
Then we live how I imagine
they lived in that canyon,

05:10.144 --> 05:12.244
With some indians.

05:12.246 --> 05:14.179
- No, I mean, get a job.

05:14.181 --> 05:17.949
There's got to be something here
at the school I can apply for.

05:17.951 --> 05:20.652
I'll do anything.

05:20.654 --> 05:23.455
- Can you apply a band-aid?
- Yes!

05:23.457 --> 05:25.490
- Can you dial 911?

05:25.492 --> 05:25.924
- Yes.

05:25.926 --> 05:29.528
- Can you wield an ice pack,
even if it's really cold?

05:29.530 --> 05:31.029
- Yes!
- Can you wield

05:31.031 --> 05:32.698
A really cold ice pack

05:32.700 --> 05:34.966
While dialing 911?

05:34.968 --> 05:36.335
- I can!

05:36.337 --> 05:38.904
- You're qualified.
- Oh, my god.

05:38.906 --> 05:39.905
- Yeah.

05:39.907 --> 05:41.606
- I'm qualified!

05:41.608 --> 05:42.541
Wha--uh--for what?

05:42.543 --> 05:46.645
- Have you heard of
the a.S.S. Contest?

05:46.647 --> 05:47.212
- I won one!

05:47.214 --> 05:51.350
But I didn't get a paperweight.
I won 50 bucks.

05:51.352 --> 05:54.353
- It's a district-wide
after school special contest

05:54.355 --> 05:55.020
That we won!

05:55.022 --> 05:57.255
And the prize is
a nurse for a month.

05:57.257 --> 05:58.690
- A school nurse?

05:58.692 --> 06:00.158
Am I really qualified
for that?

06:00.160 --> 06:02.761
- No, but you don't
have to have any experience,

06:02.763 --> 06:04.663
Or to pass
any competency tests.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.732
Heck, our last nurse
was certifiable...

06:06.734 --> 06:09.634
In cpr, but she was also
koo koo kachoo.

06:09.636 --> 06:12.738
I mean, she had a walrus face.
- Huh.

06:12.740 --> 06:13.905
- One last question.

06:13.907 --> 06:15.607
Do you have any problems
with nepotism?

06:15.609 --> 06:18.110
- Don't even know
what that is!

06:18.112 --> 06:19.611
- You're hired.

06:19.613 --> 06:20.512
- I'm a nurse!

06:20.514 --> 06:24.015
And, I already own
a nurse's outfit.

06:24.017 --> 06:26.952
- Okay, crotchless
doesn't count.

06:35.762 --> 06:38.997
- Hey, is it okay
to sit here?

06:38.999 --> 06:42.000
- [clears throat]
absolutely.

06:42.002 --> 06:44.970
Is devon gonna be okay
with that?

06:44.972 --> 06:45.370
- Yeah.

06:45.372 --> 06:49.908
She's actually off-campus and...
[phone chirps]

06:49.910 --> 06:53.478
Texting as we speak.
[sighs]

06:55.815 --> 06:57.883
- Is everything okay?
- Everything is fine.

06:57.885 --> 06:59.851
- Do you want to talk about it?
- I think that might be

06:59.853 --> 07:01.520
A little weird, you know?
Considering?

07:01.522 --> 07:02.988
- We don't have to talk
about it.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.356
- Good.
- Great.

07:04.358 --> 07:05.490
- Okay, so here's the deal.

07:05.492 --> 07:06.725
Devon was totally cool about

07:06.727 --> 07:09.661
You and our...History.
I mean, she completely

07:09.663 --> 07:11.196
Encouraged me
to stay your friend.

07:11.198 --> 07:12.764
- Wow, she's perfect.

07:12.766 --> 07:16.101
- That is what I thought,
until she completely freaked

07:16.103 --> 07:18.136
On me last night when
I went to pick you up.

07:18.138 --> 07:18.970
- Well, she's human.

07:18.972 --> 07:22.107
Wait, you left her
to pick up me?

07:22.109 --> 07:22.908
- That is besides the point.

07:22.910 --> 07:26.745
The point is that she hasn't
stopped yelling at me over text.

07:26.747 --> 07:27.446
- Is it all in caps?

07:27.448 --> 07:28.947
- Half and half.
- Then you're good.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.715
She's just venting.
- But now I am--

07:30.717 --> 07:32.584
I am a little freaked out.

07:32.586 --> 07:33.552
I mean,
I've had enough drama,

07:33.554 --> 07:37.456
So I think I might need
to take a break or something.

07:39.058 --> 07:41.626
What do you think?
- It was a loaded question.

07:41.628 --> 07:44.062
Selfishly, I wanted him
to take a break

07:44.064 --> 07:46.097
And spend his
free time with me.

07:46.099 --> 07:48.500
But, it was time
to stop being selfish.

07:48.502 --> 07:51.436
I think you should take a beat
and let her calm down.

07:51.438 --> 07:53.872
It's understandable
why she's upset.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.974
I would be too.

07:55.976 --> 07:56.775
- Yeah, you're right.

07:56.777 --> 07:59.344
- Now, can I get your opinion
on something?

07:59.346 --> 08:01.346
- Sure.
- During my sanity sabbatical,

08:01.348 --> 08:05.383
I wrote a mean article about val
for the lit magazine,

08:05.385 --> 08:06.384
And it came out today.

08:06.386 --> 08:08.320
- Hey, maybe it's not
as bad as you think.

08:08.322 --> 08:10.689
Let me take a look.

08:10.691 --> 08:13.291

- Skiddads, nancy pe-loser.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.162
I'm making a deal
with urban outfitters.

08:51.164 --> 08:53.498
Ten times what I got for
the banana slicer.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.166
- But I need
your virtual support,

08:55.168 --> 08:56.568
And since you're
my cheer-sister,

08:56.570 --> 08:58.637
You have to give it to me!

08:58.639 --> 09:02.073
- You wanna settle, crayzilla?

09:02.075 --> 09:02.774
- Settling.

09:02.776 --> 09:04.175
I know you've got thousands
of followers,

09:04.177 --> 09:06.711
And even if only a few of them
go to this school,

09:06.713 --> 09:07.612
It could totes rock my vote.

09:07.614 --> 09:10.015
So, if you could just tweet
about me,

09:10.017 --> 09:10.982
Maybe use one of my slogans,

09:10.984 --> 09:12.450
Or post a pic of us
in our cheer gear?

09:17.391 --> 09:20.325
It's not about promoting you
or anyone else.

09:20.327 --> 09:23.795
That said, if you'd like to be
a paid sponsor--

09:23.797 --> 09:24.329
- Yes! How much?

09:24.331 --> 09:26.164
- I'll give you
the banana slicer rate.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.065
500.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.600
- I don't have
that kind of money.

09:28.602 --> 09:31.603
- Well, then, I guess
I can't help you.

09:31.605 --> 09:34.773
Which works out,
because I didn't want to.

09:37.910 --> 09:38.710
- Hmm.

09:38.712 --> 09:41.112
These cookies
taste like defeat.

09:41.114 --> 09:43.615
- So does my fist.

09:44.483 --> 09:46.051
- Okay!
New mandate.

09:46.053 --> 09:47.819
We're putting our support
behind tamara now.

09:47.821 --> 09:49.254
- You're flip-flopping.
- So?

09:49.256 --> 09:51.590
The circumstances were beyond
my control.

09:51.592 --> 09:53.391
- Clearly.

09:53.393 --> 09:55.026
- Now, I want t-shirts,

09:55.028 --> 09:58.363
Cupcakes with tamara's face on
them with leopard print icing.

09:58.365 --> 09:59.431
Figure out how to do that.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.199
And who do we know who's
a skywriter?

10:01.201 --> 10:02.701
- I'm gonna stop you
right there.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.302
We're not doing any of that.

10:04.304 --> 10:05.570
- [mocking voice]
um, yes, you are.

10:05.572 --> 10:07.038
- You still don't know
how this works.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.373
- Please.
As head of the asian maf--

10:08.375 --> 10:11.943
- That's exactly what
I'm talking about.

10:13.212 --> 10:15.013
We never say
those words aloud.

10:15.015 --> 10:17.215
We're supposed to be hiding
in the shadows.

10:17.217 --> 10:19.618
Taking down posters
in the dead of night,

10:19.620 --> 10:20.819
That's the kind
of thing we do.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.887
And what's up with
the cheat sheets?

10:22.889 --> 10:24.055
I'm getting "c"s.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.690
- What?
- Yeah.

10:25.692 --> 10:26.891
And have you seen our ledger?

10:26.893 --> 10:28.660
It got puked on at a rave.

10:28.662 --> 10:29.861
- The accountant went
to a rave?

10:29.863 --> 10:31.363
- You need to get that kid
under control.

10:31.365 --> 10:33.765
- And you need to lose
the 'tude,

10:33.767 --> 10:35.567
And the jake shirts.
- And wear what?

10:35.569 --> 10:38.570
- Do I have to figure everything
out for you?

10:40.139 --> 10:42.540
You can go now.

10:45.044 --> 10:45.710
- Wow!

10:45.712 --> 10:48.013
- It's bad.
- Yes.

10:48.015 --> 10:51.149
But don't worry, people only
read the <i>experior</i>

10:51.151 --> 10:51.850
For the sex stories.

10:51.852 --> 10:53.752
Nobody's gonna bother
with your essay.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.320

as it pains me to say,

10:55.322 --> 10:58.156
Your essay is awesome!

10:58.158 --> 10:59.090
I am impressed.

10:59.092 --> 11:01.493
It is way more barbaric
than anything

11:01.495 --> 11:02.460
I could have written.

11:02.462 --> 11:04.095
- Unfortunately,
matty was wrong.

11:04.097 --> 11:06.131
People were reading
my attack ad,

11:17.411 --> 11:20.078
Why are you giving me
the cold shoulder?

11:20.080 --> 11:20.945
- Are you kidding me?

11:20.947 --> 11:22.580
- I'm really sorry I didn't take
you home last night.

11:22.582 --> 11:25.016
If it's any consolation,
I ended up getting a cab.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.017
- That's why you're sorry?

11:26.019 --> 11:27.585

I should be apologizing for?

I mean, right in front
of my face--

11:35.462 --> 11:37.962
Trying to lure me
into a threesome?

11:37.964 --> 11:40.265
- I thought you'd be cool
with it.

11:40.267 --> 11:42.233
- No. Not cool.

11:55.449 --> 11:58.216

the same page.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.617

I was clear

12:00.687 --> 12:02.220
About not wanting

- Yeah.

12:07.627 --> 12:11.029
A relationship that was
never exclusive.

Alienated my parents,

You've trusted me

But can you trust my opponent?

Well, that depends.

14:20.694 --> 14:23.294
The only reason prom tickets

14:23.296 --> 14:24.696
Is because everybody thinks

"barack o-prom-a"

the cafeteria

14:39.246 --> 14:40.411
Would have never been fixed.

to meddle in it,

was phonin' it in.

I couldn't have done it without
the asian mafia.

17:51.971 --> 17:55.473
- About that--I'm not sure
they voted for you.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.842
I mean, you won,
so they must have.

17:57.844 --> 18:00.478
Why wouldn't they?
No, they did. [laughs]

18:00.480 --> 18:02.146
I don't know.

18:02.148 --> 18:03.114
- That was so sexy.

18:03.116 --> 18:05.716
We have to role-play again
like that sometime.

18:05.718 --> 18:08.686
- That's my cue.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.221
- What's wrong?

18:10.223 --> 18:11.189
- Are you for real?

18:11.191 --> 18:13.091
A.S.B. President was my thing,

18:13.093 --> 18:15.760
So you took it from me
just for the hell of it,

18:15.762 --> 18:16.561
And it means nothing to you.

18:16.563 --> 18:18.463
- Well, it sure seemed like
it meant nothing to you.

18:18.465 --> 18:19.697
You didn't even want
to work for it.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.632
I don't understand
why you're so mad.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.034
- You're my girlfriend!

18:23.036 --> 18:25.536
What if I wanted to be
a cheerleader?

18:25.538 --> 18:26.804
- I'd love that!

18:26.806 --> 18:28.539
Camp would be a blast!

18:28.541 --> 18:29.640
- What if I took your spot?

18:29.642 --> 18:30.808
The only spot
left on the team?

18:30.810 --> 18:33.611
- I'd go back to band.
- What if I learned how to play

18:33.613 --> 18:35.346
The clarinet and then took
the last chair?

18:35.348 --> 18:38.049
- I think anyone who wants
to join band can join band.

18:38.051 --> 18:38.783
- You don't get it.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.918
- I get that someone's being
a sore loser.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.054
- I'm not being a sore loser.

18:43.056 --> 18:46.124
Whether or not you think
I was over it, I wasn't.

18:46.126 --> 18:48.926
I loved being president,
and you ruined that for me.

18:48.928 --> 18:52.163
You have no interest in this.
You just had to prove a point.

18:52.165 --> 18:55.600
You had to put me
in my place.

18:55.602 --> 18:58.369
Well now I'm gonna put you
in yours.

18:58.371 --> 19:00.972
We're done.

19:00.974 --> 19:03.374
Take care.

19:17.356 --> 19:18.055
- I had bypassed dinner,

19:18.057 --> 19:20.458
And I wasn't even on
a hunger strike.

19:20.460 --> 19:21.359
I wasn't hungry.

19:21.361 --> 19:24.629
All day, I had tried and failed
to navigate my way

19:24.631 --> 19:27.665
Through the politics
of my relationships.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.200
If aristotle's theory was true,

19:29.202 --> 19:31.536
And man, by nature,
is a political animal,

19:31.538 --> 19:34.639
I would argue that
I was a sitting duck.

19:34.641 --> 19:38.376
There was no point in trying
to right my wrongs anymore.

19:38.378 --> 19:39.043
I had gone too far,

19:39.045 --> 19:42.680
And there was only one action
left to take--

19:42.682 --> 19:44.982
Quit my campaign in disgrace.

But actions are temporary.
Words are forever.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.266
I realized that
I was making the mistake

20:02.268 --> 20:04.702
Of putting too much importance
on actions,

20:04.704 --> 20:09.340
When ultimately, words were
going to provide my redemption.
