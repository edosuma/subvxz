 I'm going to walk away,
and if you stop me before I

00:07.340 --> 00:09.467
get to my car I'll come back.

GEORGIE FLEMING MORRIS: Could
I go back to New York with you,

00:14.472 --> 00:16.725
not just to visit, but to live?

00:16.850 --> 00:18.560
 It was Peyton.

00:18.685 --> 00:19.853
I have proof.

00:19.978 --> 00:21.604
 You posted the video
from Dylan's computer.

00:21.730 --> 00:23.189
But I told him not
to tell anyone.

00:23.314 --> 00:24.524
 Why would you do that?

00:24.649 --> 00:26.735
 So that I can beat
you fair and square.

00:26.860 --> 00:27.861
 I very much doubt that.

00:27.986 --> 00:29.029
 See you at the Fall Finale.

00:29.154 --> 00:30.530
 I just can't keep waiting.

00:30.655 --> 00:32.365
I got to take matters
into my own hands.

00:32.490 --> 00:36.411
I got to take the time
I have left and use it.

You guys are amazing.

01:18.203 --> 01:19.537
 Thanks.

01:19.662 --> 01:21.623
Yeah, it definitely
helps relieve stress.

01:21.748 --> 01:26.086
 Speaking of stress, I've got
to go over to Westfield today.

01:26.211 --> 01:27.462
 Why?

01:27.587 --> 01:28.922
 I forgot some tack
and brushes there.

01:29.047 --> 01:31.257
I'm kind of dreading it.

01:31.383 --> 01:32.967
 You want me to go with you?

01:33.093 --> 01:34.010
 Yeah, that'd be great.

01:34.135 --> 01:35.095
Thank you.

01:35.220 --> 01:36.262
No worries.

01:39.057 --> 01:39.974
 Wow.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.810
 Yeah.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.937
I thought it would be helpful to
keep a record of whose stone is

01:44.062 --> 01:47.691
whose, you know, just to help
our memory as we get older.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.067
 Excuse me?

01:49.192 --> 01:51.569
 As we all get older, Grandpa.

01:51.695 --> 01:53.988
And you know, for
future generations.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.115
 Yeah, I think
that's a great idea.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.450
 Thank you.

01:57.575 --> 01:59.536
 So Amy and Ty, they pick
a stone for Lyndy yet?

01:59.661 --> 02:00.495
 No.

02:04.416 --> 02:05.625
Did I forgot someone?

02:05.750 --> 02:06.501
 No.

02:06.626 --> 02:07.502
No, you didn't.

02:07.627 --> 02:08.502
I did.

02:15.176 --> 02:17.178
 Stop acting like
we're sneaking in.

02:17.303 --> 02:19.806
 I just-- I don't want to
run into Dylan or Peyton.

you can't use our arena.

 Don't bother.

 Look, about Peyton and
the way things turned out.

02:46.249 --> 02:48.335
I want you to know
how sorry I am.

10:45.603 --> 10:46.521
how have I solved your problem?

10:46.646 --> 10:47.522
It's pretty self-explanatory.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.607
Didn't you see the photo?

10:49.733 --> 10:51.901
I found the perfect
longhorn for Jack.

10:52.027 --> 10:53.653
I'm looking at his
animal right now,

10:53.778 --> 10:57.157
and the one that I saw today
is a total doppelganger.

10:57.282 --> 10:59.034
Well, close enough.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.411
Jack won't know the difference.

11:01.536 --> 11:02.912
TY BORDEN: Come on, Caleb.

11:03.038 --> 11:04.080
Jack's going to know it's
not his in two seconds.

11:04.205 --> 11:06.541
He knows every marking
on that animal.

11:06.666 --> 11:07.500
 Yeah.

11:07.625 --> 11:08.877
I guess you're right.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.378
I'm doing my best here.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.379
 I know, I know.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.505
I appreciate it.

11:12.630 --> 11:14.132
OK.

11:14.257 --> 11:15.050
I'll talk to you soon.
CALEB ODELL (ON PHONE): Bye.

11:15.175 --> 11:15.842
 Bye.

11:15.967 --> 11:18.887
[music playing]

11:22.599 --> 11:24.017
 Amy.

11:24.142 --> 11:26.394
 Val.

11:26.519 --> 11:27.354
VAL STANTON: Georgie.

11:32.359 --> 11:35.653
As I'm sure you've heard,
Dylan is out of the running.

11:35.779 --> 11:37.781
I have a proposition for you.

11:37.906 --> 11:41.034
I want you to ride Flame.

11:41.159 --> 11:43.036
 No.

11:43.161 --> 11:45.288
 No?

11:45.413 --> 11:47.332
 No thanks.

11:47.457 --> 11:51.378
 And that's it?

11:51.503 --> 11:56.091
I'm offering you a red ribbon on
a platter, and it's just "no?"

11:58.468 --> 12:01.930
[music playing]

12:09.771 --> 12:12.399
AMY FLEMING: So yeah, Val
offered Flame for Georgie

12:12.524 --> 12:13.608
to ride at the Fall Finale.

12:13.733 --> 12:14.651
 I don't believe her.

12:14.776 --> 12:15.568
 Oh, I do.

12:15.694 --> 12:17.237
That is so Val.

12:17.362 --> 12:18.780
- And you said no?
- Well, yeah.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.281
Of course I did.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.491
 After everything that
Val's put her through,

12:21.616 --> 12:22.784
of course she should say no.

12:22.909 --> 12:23.993
 I think you should
take her up on it.

12:24.119 --> 12:25.245
You have a better
chance of winning.

12:25.370 --> 12:26.204
 Excuse me?

12:26.329 --> 12:27.414
 Dad.

12:27.539 --> 12:29.499
 That's not a reason
to make a decision.

12:29.624 --> 12:31.584
 Yeah, and I would
never do that to Phoenix.

12:31.710 --> 12:33.086
We're partners.

12:33.211 --> 12:34.713
We've come way too far for
me to just quit on him.

12:34.838 --> 12:36.881
 Georgie, that horse is still
recovering from an injury.

12:37.007 --> 12:37.799
 He's fine.

12:37.924 --> 12:39.217
And what about Dylan?

12:39.342 --> 12:40.552
When he recovers, he
won't have a horse.

12:40.677 --> 12:42.012
 Well, that's his problem.

12:42.137 --> 12:43.888
 And you don't owe the
Westfields any favors.

12:44.014 --> 12:45.724
 Now, you go with
the horse that gives

12:45.849 --> 12:46.808
you the best chance of winning.

12:46.933 --> 12:48.309
There's no doubt about it.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.812
People switch horses all
the time, don't they, Lisa?

12:50.937 --> 12:52.147
 Yes, they do.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.774
 Anyway, it's
Georgie's decision.

12:54.899 --> 12:56.192
 Yes, and I've made it.

12:56.317 --> 12:57.110
 Hi.

12:57.235 --> 12:58.236
 Yeah.

12:58.361 --> 12:59.487
Just sending Caleb
a text message here.

13:00.572 --> 13:01.614
LOU FLEMING: Katie, dinner.

13:01.740 --> 13:03.950
 OK.

13:04.075 --> 13:04.909
CALEB ODELL: Hey, Ty.

13:05.035 --> 13:05.910
Got your text.

13:06.036 --> 13:07.454
What's happening?

13:07.579 --> 13:08.997
 I've been thinking
about that longhorn

13:09.122 --> 13:11.875
that you sent me a picture of?

13:12.000 --> 13:14.836
And I think your
idea just might work.

13:14.961 --> 13:15.795
 No, man.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.422
You were right.

13:17.547 --> 13:20.008
Jack would know it's not his
longhorn from a mile away.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.677
 But Dave Chalmers might not.

13:22.802 --> 13:23.762
You heard him.

13:23.887 --> 13:25.138
He hates that animal.

13:25.263 --> 13:26.848
I think he's just
keeping it out of spite.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.266
 What are you saying?

13:28.391 --> 13:30.852
 I'm saying we switch them out.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.145
 Switch them out?

13:32.270 --> 13:32.854
 Yeah.

13:32.979 --> 13:35.648
 You're crazy.

13:35.774 --> 13:37.609
 Maybe?

13:37.734 --> 13:39.152
Are you?

13:39.277 --> 13:40.362
 Absolutely.

13:40.487 --> 13:41.321
 Yeah?

13:41.446 --> 13:43.323
 Yeah.

13:43.448 --> 13:46.368
 I'm sure looking
forward to Lyndy's day.

13:46.493 --> 13:49.329
Lou and Lisa have a
real nice lunch planned.

13:49.454 --> 13:51.998
 Yeah, Lou was
telling me about it.

13:52.123 --> 13:55.210
Grandpa, this might
sound crazy, but I think

13:55.335 --> 13:57.462
I remember my naming ceremony.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.172
Is that possible?

13:59.297 --> 14:00.382
I mean, how old was I?

14:00.507 --> 14:01.716
 Well, you couldn't
have been more

14:01.841 --> 14:04.344
than a year, year and a half.

14:04.469 --> 14:05.845
 I remember.
JACK BARTLETT: You do?

14:05.970 --> 14:07.639
 Yeah.

14:07.764 --> 14:09.974
Mom was riding a horse, and I
think that she did some kind

14:10.100 --> 14:12.143
of trick or something.

14:12.268 --> 14:14.354
But it was really
special for me,

14:14.479 --> 14:16.439
and I want it to be
special for Lyndy too.

14:16.564 --> 14:20.735
 Well, I was thinking
I'd like to make

14:20.860 --> 14:22.404
the day even more special.

14:22.529 --> 14:23.530
 Yeah?

14:23.655 --> 14:25.407
JACK BARTLETT:
Wouldn't it be nice

14:25.532 --> 14:30.370
if we surprised Lisa and got
her to pick a stone of her own?

14:30.495 --> 14:31.996
Tell you the truth, I
can't believe we haven't

14:32.122 --> 14:33.957
thought of it before now.

14:34.082 --> 14:36.376
You know, she has
had a rough year,

14:36.501 --> 14:41.423
and this could be the
perfect surprise for her.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.174
 Yeah.

14:43.299 --> 14:44.843
Yeah, that's something we
could definitely talk about.

14:44.968 --> 14:46.219
Um, but not right now.

14:46.344 --> 14:48.513
I should get Lyndy
in her own bed.

14:48.638 --> 14:49.431
 OK.

14:53.143 --> 14:55.020
AMY FLEMING: Grandpa
wants Lisa to get a stone

14:55.145 --> 14:57.814
on the same day as Lyndy.

14:57.939 --> 14:59.399
 OK.

14:59.524 --> 15:00.400
 OK?

15:00.525 --> 15:01.526
Just it's OK?

15:04.487 --> 15:08.783
Why can't Lisa have her stone
naming on, uh, her birthday?

15:08.908 --> 15:11.119
Or an anniversary?

15:11.244 --> 15:12.454
 Amy, I think you're
being a little too

15:12.579 --> 15:13.788
sensitive about this.

15:13.913 --> 15:17.292
 No, I don't think I am.

15:17.417 --> 15:18.460
 I do.

15:18.585 --> 15:19.669
I mean, let's be honest.

15:19.794 --> 15:21.880
She's probably not even
going to remember it.

15:22.005 --> 15:23.715
 Yes, she will.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.216
 No, she won't.

15:25.342 --> 15:26.217
 Um, yeah.

15:26.343 --> 15:27.052
She will.

15:27.177 --> 15:29.304
I remember my naming day.

15:29.429 --> 15:30.055
 You remember?

15:30.180 --> 15:31.890
AMY FLEMING: Yes, I do.

15:32.015 --> 15:32.932
 What do you remember?

15:33.058 --> 15:34.100
 What-- I, I--

15:34.225 --> 15:35.268
- What do you remember?
- OK, OK.

15:35.393 --> 15:36.603
I remember, I remember the day.

15:36.728 --> 15:37.437
I remember the ceremony.

15:37.562 --> 15:39.022
 OK.

15:39.147 --> 15:41.816
 I remember that my mom had
this, this tan suede jacket.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.735
 Yeah, she always wore
that tan suede jacket.

15:43.860 --> 15:46.363
 Yeah, but I remember that
she was riding a horse.

15:46.488 --> 15:47.739
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:47.864 --> 15:48.823
 Oh, right.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.158
She never rode horses before.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.368
 Hey, that's not fair.

15:51.493 --> 15:52.786
I remember.

15:52.911 --> 15:54.412
 Well, do you remember
how much I love you?

15:54.537 --> 15:55.163
 No.
I--

15:55.288 --> 15:56.289
- You don't?
- No.

15:56.414 --> 15:57.374
You're going to
have to remind me.

15:57.499 --> 15:58.333
 Falling in.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.335
 [giggles]

16:03.296 --> 16:04.172
 Get up.

16:08.593 --> 16:10.637
Come on.

16:10.762 --> 16:12.597
Here.

16:12.722 --> 16:13.515
That's it.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.810
You can do it.

16:16.935 --> 16:17.936
You can do it.

16:18.061 --> 16:19.104
Hey.

16:24.234 --> 16:26.194
Come on, you can do it.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.279
Come on, you can do it.

16:28.405 --> 16:29.030
 Hey.

16:29.155 --> 16:31.491
 No, come on.

16:31.616 --> 16:33.284
Hey.

16:33.410 --> 16:36.538
I am never going to get this.

16:36.663 --> 16:37.831
 What?

16:37.956 --> 16:40.625
Well, don't put too much
pressure on yourself.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.502
Lyndy is going to
be excited just

16:42.627 --> 16:43.962
to see you running around in
circles playing with a horse.

16:44.087 --> 16:45.380
 Really?

16:45.505 --> 16:46.798
Is that what liberty
work is to you, running

16:46.923 --> 16:48.216
around in circles with a horse?

16:48.341 --> 16:49.968
 I think that-- that's
what it'll be to her.

16:50.093 --> 16:52.095
I mean, I like it.

16:52.220 --> 16:55.724
It's, it's, it's beautiful.

16:55.849 --> 16:57.851
But you don't have
anything to prove to her.

16:57.976 --> 16:59.060
 Yes, I do.

16:59.185 --> 17:01.146
I have big shoes to fill, Dad.

17:01.271 --> 17:05.483
I remember Mom being this
strong, fearless horse woman.

17:05.608 --> 17:07.152
 Like you.

17:07.277 --> 17:08.987
 She was a superhero to me.

17:09.112 --> 17:11.239
And I want to be that to Lyndy

17:11.364 --> 17:13.157
 Honey, you already are.

17:17.454 --> 17:18.538
OK.

17:18.663 --> 17:19.497
 OK.

17:19.622 --> 17:20.832
 Stay with it.

17:20.957 --> 17:21.915
 Dad.

17:22.041 --> 17:22.959
 Yeah.

17:23.084 --> 17:24.711
 Have you heard anything?

17:24.836 --> 17:25.753
 No.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.505
No, I told you.

17:27.630 --> 17:29.007
As soon as I hear something,
you'll be the first to know.

17:29.132 --> 17:32.260
[music playing]

17:33.553 --> 17:34.262
JACK BARTLETT: Well,
you're happy that you're

17:34.387 --> 17:35.889
sticking with Phoenix?

17:36.014 --> 17:37.349
 Yeah.

17:37.474 --> 17:38.933
I am.

17:39.059 --> 17:42.771
 So riding Phoenix, is that
a, a long term decision?

17:45.899 --> 17:49.569
 You're talking about
New York, aren't you?

17:49.694 --> 17:52.739
 I'm wondering which way
you're leaning on that, yeah.

17:52.864 --> 17:53.740
 I'm going.

17:56.743 --> 17:59.037
I think.

17:59.162 --> 18:02.749
 Well, don't make
any hasty decisions.

18:05.919 --> 18:11.091
 Jack, am I an idiot
for not picking Flame?

18:11.216 --> 18:13.760
The people on that website,
they trashed Phoenix,

18:13.885 --> 18:15.804
and then call him a, a cow pony,
and I know that's not true.

18:15.929 --> 18:17.263
But--

18:17.389 --> 18:21.059
JACK BARTLETT: And
that's all that matters.

18:21.184 --> 18:25.021
Georgie, you can't
make any plan based

18:25.146 --> 18:27.315
on the actions of
thoughtless people

18:27.440 --> 18:30.235
who hide like cowards
behind their words.

18:34.823 --> 18:37.200
I'll never understand
why some people

18:37.325 --> 18:41.788
insist on using that internet to
deliberately hurt other people.

18:41.913 --> 18:45.125
It's not right.

18:45.250 --> 18:47.168
So don't you doubt yourself.

18:49.629 --> 18:53.174
And don't doubt Phoenix either.

18:53.299 --> 18:57.137
He'll get you where
you want to go.

18:57.262 --> 18:58.430
 I know.

18:58.555 --> 18:59.848
I'll try.

18:59.973 --> 19:03.518
[music playing]

19:13.486 --> 19:14.446
 Hey.

19:14.571 --> 19:16.239
Um, I forgot to tell you.

19:16.364 --> 19:18.533
We're having a
lunch on Saturday.

19:18.658 --> 19:21.327
It's Lyndy's naming ceremony.

19:21.453 --> 19:23.329
 Doesn't she
already have a name?

19:23.455 --> 19:26.166
 [laughs] It's a
family tradition.

19:26.291 --> 19:27.834
All the new babies
through the generations

19:27.959 --> 19:29.836
get given a stone on
the fireplace which

19:29.961 --> 19:32.047
then becomes theirs forever.

19:32.172 --> 19:34.466
Anyways, can you come?

19:34.591 --> 19:36.468
 Well, can I come
as me this time,

19:36.593 --> 19:38.887
or do I have to
pretend to be Peter?

19:39.012 --> 19:41.348
 I apologize for that.

19:41.473 --> 19:43.141
In the future I
promise to refrain

19:43.266 --> 19:47.187
from inappropriate requests
and terrible business advice.

19:47.312 --> 19:49.564
 The future?

19:49.689 --> 19:51.649
 Can you come?

19:51.775 --> 19:52.734
 Is Peter going to be there?

19:52.859 --> 19:53.651
 Yes.

19:53.777 --> 19:56.321
So I understand if you opt out.

19:56.446 --> 19:57.739
I know there's tension.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.199
 Actually, no, there's,
there's no tension.

19:59.324 --> 20:00.700
We're good.

20:00.825 --> 20:02.660
We're tight ever since we
babysat Lyndy together.

20:02.786 --> 20:03.828
 Really?

20:03.953 --> 20:05.163
Well, then I guess
I'll see you there.

20:05.288 --> 20:07.248
 Hey, is, uh, is Jack in?

20:07.374 --> 20:10.418
 I think he's in the barn.

20:10.543 --> 20:13.922
Hey, when did you and Peter
babysit Lyndy together?

20:16.841 --> 20:20.261
[music playing]

20:21.805 --> 20:25.266
[horse running]

20:46.996 --> 20:49.457
 I know you acted in
haste the other day,

20:49.582 --> 20:52.502
and perhaps you had reason to.

20:52.627 --> 20:54.879
So I want to give you
one more chance, Georgie.

20:55.005 --> 20:56.339
 Val, stop it.

20:56.464 --> 20:58.800
I already told you I'm
sticking with Phoenix.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.301
 Really?

21:00.427 --> 21:02.429
You still want to compete
with this unreliable poor

21:02.554 --> 21:03.596
excuse for a jumper.

21:03.722 --> 21:04.681
 Yes.

21:04.806 --> 21:06.599
So you can find another
rider for Flame.

21:06.725 --> 21:07.434
 And I will.

21:07.559 --> 21:09.519
You can be assured of that.

21:09.644 --> 21:12.939
But Georgie, it's
time you woke up.

21:15.567 --> 21:17.777
You know you're
going to regret this.

21:17.902 --> 21:19.821
You're making a
very big mistake.

21:19.946 --> 21:23.491
[music playing]

21:29.205 --> 21:31.166
 It's OK.

21:31.291 --> 21:32.083
Don't listen.

21:32.208 --> 21:33.293
You're a good boy.

21:35.587 --> 21:36.838
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

21:36.963 --> 21:37.630
 What you doing here?

21:37.756 --> 21:39.591
 I bought the longhorn.

21:39.716 --> 21:40.508
 You did?

21:40.633 --> 21:41.426
 Yeah.

21:41.551 --> 21:42.635
I'm very proud of the limit.

21:42.761 --> 21:44.179
Paid mere peanuts for him.
- Wait--

21:44.304 --> 21:45.180
 You still owe me, though.

21:45.305 --> 21:46.181
 He's here right now?

21:46.306 --> 21:47.682
 Yeah.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.976
 Uh, Caleb, you, you
can't leave the-- you

21:50.101 --> 21:51.603
can't leave the trailer here.
Jack's going to see it.

21:51.728 --> 21:52.812
He's going to start
asking questions.

21:52.937 --> 21:53.980
 Where did you
expect me to put it?

21:54.105 --> 21:55.815
Rodeo grounds
going to charge me,

21:55.940 --> 21:57.192
and that is no way to thank
the man who found the steer.

21:57.317 --> 21:58.818
 OK, fine, fine.

21:58.943 --> 21:59.944
But you got to take it
back to the rodeo grounds.

22:00.070 --> 22:01.112
I'll pay the fee, OK?

22:01.237 --> 22:04.491
 OK, but you should
come see him first.

22:04.616 --> 22:05.867
Right?
Dead ringer.

22:07.369 --> 22:08.453
 Uh.

22:10.705 --> 22:12.374
Uh, Caleb's horse.

22:12.499 --> 22:14.959
He, uh, needed some shots, so--

22:15.085 --> 22:16.711
 Ah, he's better now
though, so I'm going to go.

22:16.836 --> 22:17.629
 Yeah.

 Man.

22:21.383 --> 22:22.967
 What are you up to?

22:23.093 --> 22:23.885
 Oh, nothing.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.512
It's nothing.

22:25.637 --> 22:26.805
 Ty.

22:26.930 --> 22:29.474
There's something going on.

22:29.599 --> 22:32.060
 Maybe, but I want
it to be a surprise.

Oh, shoot.

We can't, we can't, we
can't put him the same pen

23:09.639 --> 23:10.432

23:10.557 --> 23:11.850
Dave's going to know.

supposed to go away anyway,

 You were amazing today, huh?

Yeah, we showed 'em.

34:08.005 --> 34:09.049
Yeah.

34:09.174 --> 34:10.175
WYATT: Hey.

34:15.554 --> 34:17.056
 Hey.

34:17.181 --> 34:18.641
 You did it.

34:18.766 --> 34:21.436
Just wanted to come
by to say congrats.

34:21.561 --> 34:23.980
 Thanks.

34:24.105 --> 34:27.900
 Wow, I bet this will stop all
those evil internet trolls now,

34:28.025 --> 34:28.860

 Maybe.

I, I hope so.

WYATT: No, no, no.

34:39.245 --> 34:40.789
I didn't come by to
make you feel like you

34:40.914 --> 34:41.873
had to say anything or--

34:41.998 --> 34:44.125
 No, I just--

34:44.250 --> 34:46.710
I wanted to thank you
for the phone call.

34:46.835 --> 34:51.091
It was really thoughtful
and helped me a lot.

34:51.216 --> 34:53.051
 Good.

34:53.176 --> 34:55.303
I'm glad.

34:55.428 --> 34:57.764
I almost didn't call.

34:57.889 --> 35:00.475
All I needed was to make
another stupid assumption

35:00.600 --> 35:02.852
of how you were going to react.

35:02.977 --> 35:05.438
 What assumption?

35:05.563 --> 35:07.982
 I just shouldn't have
given you that ultimatum.

35:08.108 --> 35:10.276
Total fail, you know.

35:10.402 --> 35:13.321
It's like I said, I'm, I'm just
not good at that kind of stuff.

35:13.446 --> 35:14.114
 Yeah.

35:14.239 --> 35:16.032
You aren't.

35:16.157 --> 35:18.618
Total fail.

35:18.743 --> 35:19.661
 OK.

35:22.789 --> 35:25.250
Well, see you.

35:26.251 --> 35:26.418
GEORGIE FLEMING MORRIS: Yeah.

35:31.131 --> 35:32.257
 Yeah.

35:42.392 --> 35:43.476
I shouldn't have driven away.

35:52.610 --> 35:53.445
 It's huge.

35:53.570 --> 35:54.112
 Yeah.

35:54.237 --> 35:55.530
[chatter]

35:58.158 --> 36:01.244
 Um, hey, Mom.

36:01.369 --> 36:07.667
Um, I've decided I'm
going to stay here.

36:07.792 --> 36:08.335
You were right.

36:08.460 --> 36:12.005
I, I can't run away.

36:12.130 --> 36:12.881
Is that OK?

36:13.006 --> 36:13.798
 Yes.

36:13.923 --> 36:15.133
Of course.

36:15.258 --> 36:18.178
I mean, I'm a little, you know.

36:18.303 --> 36:19.346
But of course.

JACK BARTLETT: Come on
over here, everyone.

36:28.897 --> 36:35.653
Now, first of all, we want
to say a big congratulations

36:35.779 --> 36:39.699
to our first place winner
who rose to the occasion

36:39.824 --> 36:42.077
when it could have
been so easy to quit.

36:42.202 --> 36:42.911
 Yeah, Georgie.

36:43.036 --> 36:44.704
 Woo!

36:44.829 --> 36:46.998
JACK BARTLETT: You made us
awfully proud today, Georgie,

36:47.123 --> 36:50.335
and I know you'll continue
to do that wherever you are.

36:53.463 --> 36:58.009
Now, this year has
been, well, a pretty

36:58.134 --> 37:00.970
crazy ride for all of us.

37:01.096 --> 37:06.935
It's been a year of some huge
highs and, and some deep lows.

37:07.060 --> 37:09.938
It's a year that threatened
to tear us all apart,

37:10.063 --> 37:14.651
but instead, well, I believe
it brought us together.

37:14.776 --> 37:19.656
And we're here today to
celebrate the family.

37:19.781 --> 37:22.909
It's a family that
continues to grow.

37:23.034 --> 37:25.453
We're all gathered
here to officially

37:25.578 --> 37:29.082
welcome Amy and Ty's daughter.

37:29.207 --> 37:35.714
Now, what started out as
a Bartlett tradition has,

37:35.839 --> 37:38.925
uh, well, has become
a Bartlett Fleming

37:39.050 --> 37:43.096
Morris Borden tradition.

37:43.221 --> 37:47.350
And it's as unique as the
child we're celebrating.

37:47.475 --> 37:50.812
So now let's welcome
this beautiful baby

37:50.937 --> 37:55.650
and bless her with her name
and a stone of her own.

37:55.775 --> 37:57.986
 Thanks, Jack.

37:58.111 --> 37:59.571
OK, Lyndy.

37:59.696 --> 38:00.864
You ready?

38:00.989 --> 38:03.783
 Do you want to pick
a stone, sweetie?

38:03.908 --> 38:04.659
This is mine.

38:04.784 --> 38:06.745
 This is Dad.

38:06.870 --> 38:07.787
How about up here?

38:07.912 --> 38:09.789
Can you touch this
one right here?

38:09.914 --> 38:11.541

38:11.666 --> 38:14.127
AMY FLEMING: Yay.

JACK BARTLETT: Lyndy Marion
Borden, welcome to this family,

38:19.424 --> 38:20.925
my little one.

38:21.051 --> 38:22.302
You're a very lucky girl.

38:22.427 --> 38:23.845
I hope you never forget that.

38:23.970 --> 38:27.307
And may you always have
joy and love in your heart,

38:27.432 --> 38:29.684
and may you always
have good health,

38:29.809 --> 38:32.645
and bear your name
with honor and grow

38:32.771 --> 38:36.399

understanding person.

38:42.989 --> 38:43.865
 Cheers.

38:49.329 --> 38:54.000
 And there's someone else
that we need to honor today

38:54.125 --> 38:58.880
with a stone, someone who
has been a part of our family

38:59.005 --> 39:05.470
for a long time now, and someone
who we couldn't live without.

39:05.595 --> 39:07.472
 And we all appreciate her.

39:07.597 --> 39:09.057
 And we love her.

Oh.

39:15.772 --> 39:19.818
Oh, I didn't-- thank you, honey.

39:19.943 --> 39:20.610
Thank you.

39:20.735 --> 39:21.486
 Pick your stone.

39:21.611 --> 39:22.570
 Pick my stone.

39:22.696 --> 39:25.824
Well, um, where are you?

39:25.949 --> 39:26.491
 I don't know.

39:26.616 --> 39:27.409
I can't remember.

39:27.534 --> 39:29.703
 Oh, Grandpa.

39:29.828 --> 39:30.453
 That's me.

39:30.578 --> 39:31.496
 All right.

39:31.621 --> 39:33.081
Well, are-- is that taken?

39:33.206 --> 39:34.666
If it's not, I'll take that one.

39:34.791 --> 39:36.292
JACK BARTLETT: Well, I love
that it's right beside me.

39:36.418 --> 39:38.003
It's yours if you want it.

39:38.128 --> 39:38.962
 I will.

39:39.087 --> 39:41.256
Thank you.

39:41.381 --> 39:42.090
Thank you, everybody.

[baby coos]

39:47.220 --> 39:52.350
 Um, I'd like to say something.

39:52.475 --> 39:56.855
[sighs] I guess, uh, this might
not be the most appropriate

39:56.980 --> 39:58.231
time, but I don't
know when we'll all

39:58.356 --> 40:00.900
be together again in this room.

40:01.026 --> 40:03.903
And I promised I'd keep you
in the loop about my health.

40:04.029 --> 40:09.117
And I got some results
back from my latest tests.

40:12.912 --> 40:15.165
I'm clear.

40:15.290 --> 40:17.917
The shadow's gone.

40:18.043 --> 40:18.918
 You're clear?

40:19.044 --> 40:19.836
You're clear.

40:19.961 --> 40:20.754
 Oh, good.

40:25.925 --> 40:27.135
CALEB ODELL: That's good news.

40:27.260 --> 40:30.096
 That's such good news.

40:30.221 --> 40:32.098
 Hey, girls.

40:32.223 --> 40:34.517
There's something, uh,
else I should tell you,

40:34.642 --> 40:36.102
and you probably
don't know this.

40:36.227 --> 40:40.899
But, uh, your father doesn't
have a stone on that hearth.

40:41.024 --> 40:41.816
 You don't?

40:41.941 --> 40:42.942
 What?

40:43.068 --> 40:44.986
 I--

40:45.111 --> 40:45.779
 Why not?

40:45.904 --> 40:47.364
 Talk to Jack about it.

40:47.489 --> 40:48.239
Long story.

40:48.365 --> 40:49.282
 Dad.

40:49.407 --> 40:52.410
 But not for today.

40:52.535 --> 40:54.287
Listen, everyone.

40:54.412 --> 40:56.956
Amy has something that
she wants to show Lyndy.

I'm a lover but I fight

There's a light inside my

I've got a complicated
animal desire,

41:19.354 --> 41:24.776
