01:31.700 --> 01:33.752
Amberle, you still alive?

01:33.754 --> 01:35.036
Relax, Uncle Ander.

01:35.038 --> 01:36.538
It's not like I'm gonna break.

01:38.458 --> 01:40.709
How many times have I
missed that jump tonight?

01:40.711 --> 01:42.293
Five.

01:42.295 --> 01:43.712
You lose count of your steps tomorrow,

01:43.714 --> 01:46.348
it'll be the shortest
half mile of your life.

01:49.019 --> 01:50.435
- I'm going again.
- No.

01:50.437 --> 01:51.636
It's late.

01:51.638 --> 01:53.638
The race starts at dawn...
you need to rest.

01:53.640 --> 01:55.807
But only the first seven
runners across the line

01:55.809 --> 01:58.109
become members of the Chosen.

01:58.111 --> 02:01.363
I didn't do all of this just to lose.

02:06.203 --> 02:08.152
Princess, are you sure
you wanna step on

02:08.155 --> 02:09.571
thousands of years of Elvin tradition?

02:09.573 --> 02:10.955
There's no turning back.

02:10.957 --> 02:12.874
We need to get in there and
stake out my starting place.

02:12.876 --> 02:14.292
Don't worry.

02:14.294 --> 02:16.578
As your friend and loyal
servant, I've got you covered.

02:16.580 --> 02:19.080
Okay, let's stay focused, Catania.

02:23.086 --> 02:25.587
Bet you wish you'd told
Lorin you were running now.

02:25.589 --> 02:28.306
He's a big boy, he can handle it.

02:30.594 --> 02:32.093
Jace told me

02:32.095 --> 02:34.095
that if Lorin becomes a
member of the Chosen,

02:34.097 --> 02:35.814
he's gonna ask you to marry him.

02:35.816 --> 02:37.766
Amberle.

02:37.768 --> 02:40.101
You're not allowed here.

02:40.103 --> 02:42.153
Have you come to wish me luck?

02:43.023 --> 02:45.273
Yes...

02:45.275 --> 02:47.575
and no.

02:50.781 --> 02:52.781
I'm racing too.

02:58.171 --> 03:00.505
You're kidding?

03:00.507 --> 03:03.425
Is there a rule that says a
girl can't run the Gauntlet?

03:03.427 --> 03:05.427
That's the way it's always been.

03:05.429 --> 03:07.011
We have female commanders
in the Elvin army,

03:07.013 --> 03:08.379
and women on the High Council.

03:08.381 --> 03:10.465
It's time the Four Lands
had a female Chosen.

03:11.685 --> 03:12.851
You knew about this?

03:12.853 --> 03:14.552
Who do you think sneaked
her past the Home Guard

03:14.554 --> 03:16.187
and out of the palace?

03:20.143 --> 03:22.310
The Gauntlet is dangerous, Amberle.

03:22.312 --> 03:24.612
These guys will do anything to win.

03:24.614 --> 03:26.364
So will I.

03:29.736 --> 03:31.119
Then good luck.

03:32.072 --> 03:33.488
May the best elf win.

03:40.297 --> 03:43.832
I'm definitely sensing a lot
of sweaty elf boy hate.

03:43.834 --> 03:46.050
Are you sure you want to do this?

03:49.556 --> 03:52.423
Tie me up.

03:55.095 --> 03:57.345
Steady!

03:57.347 --> 04:00.148
Only the first seven to cross

04:00.150 --> 04:02.851
will be anointed.

04:04.404 --> 04:07.188
On the sound of my horn...

04:32.215 --> 04:33.848
Get up, Amberle.

05:06.716 --> 05:08.466
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

05:09.803 --> 05:10.752
One, two, three, four...

05:35.929 --> 05:37.595
Jump.

05:50.110 --> 05:53.778
They're coming!

06:09.879 --> 06:10.929
One!

06:18.855 --> 06:20.271
Two!

06:22.442 --> 06:24.275
Three!

06:24.277 --> 06:25.643
Four!

06:42.379 --> 06:44.629
Five!

06:47.250 --> 06:49.634
Six!

06:50.503 --> 06:51.970
- Don't give up!
- Go!

06:51.972 --> 06:54.088
There's one Chosen left!

06:54.090 --> 06:56.674
Get up!

08:00.763 --> 08:02.887
- sync and corrections by Caio -
- www.addic7ed.com -

08:25.482 --> 08:27.648
It's a girl.

08:27.650 --> 08:30.017
- Look.
- I can't believe it.

08:30.019 --> 08:32.770
Is that the princess?

08:51.958 --> 08:55.126
I thought you were
teaching her how to fence?

08:55.128 --> 08:57.345
She was a quick study.

09:21.404 --> 09:23.571
Congratulations.

09:23.573 --> 09:26.707
As king, I welcome you to
the Order of the Chosen.

09:37.504 --> 09:40.471
At the dawn of every new year,

09:40.473 --> 09:43.307
we gather in this sacred garden

09:43.309 --> 09:46.394
to recount the story of the Ellcrys.

09:48.264 --> 09:50.898
Thousands of years ago...

09:50.900 --> 09:52.850
our Elven ancestors fought a war

09:52.852 --> 09:54.769
against an army of Demons.

09:54.771 --> 09:58.022
The Elves were at the
point of annihilation,

09:58.024 --> 10:01.359
when their elders turned to magic.

10:01.361 --> 10:03.578
Using this powerful gift,

10:03.580 --> 10:06.998
they managed to imprison the Demons

10:07.000 --> 10:10.334
in a realm known as the Forbidding.

10:10.336 --> 10:13.371
The Ellcrys was created

10:13.373 --> 10:15.423
to stand sentry.

10:15.425 --> 10:16.924
As long as it lives,

10:16.926 --> 10:20.044
the Demons are locked
up for all eternity.

10:20.046 --> 10:23.681
Now, I realize that for some of you,

10:23.683 --> 10:25.967
this is merely...

10:25.969 --> 10:27.885
folklore.

10:27.887 --> 10:30.521
But in no way

10:30.523 --> 10:34.025
does this diminish
your responsibilities.

10:34.027 --> 10:37.895
And you are now its protectors.

10:40.033 --> 10:41.449
Now step forward,

10:41.451 --> 10:45.036
place your hands on the tree,
and be accepted by the Ellcrys.

11:00.887 --> 11:05.056
I can't believe you let her
embarrass our father like that.

11:05.058 --> 11:06.424
s hi last ceremony

11:06.426 --> 11:07.592
before he abdicates the throne.

11:07.594 --> 11:09.510
I didn't let Amberle do anything.

11:09.512 --> 11:11.312
Okay, this was her idea.

11:11.314 --> 11:12.847
I just aided and abetted.

11:12.849 --> 11:15.433
She could have seriously hurt herself.

11:15.435 --> 11:16.651
I thought for Aine's sake

11:16.653 --> 11:18.603
that you'd want to keep her safe.

11:18.605 --> 11:20.905
Invoking our dead brother,
that's very subtle.

11:20.907 --> 11:22.323
You should work that into
your coronation speech.

11:22.325 --> 11:24.942
We made a pact to
protect her, remember?

11:24.944 --> 11:27.912
Well, at least you'll know where
she'll be for the next year...

11:27.914 --> 11:31.666
locked behind these walls,
watering an old tree.

11:31.668 --> 11:34.418
Do you have any respect
for Elvin traditions?

11:34.420 --> 11:36.621
Only the ones with parties.

12:48.031 --> 12:49.781
_

12:51.391 --> 12:53.164
_

12:54.578 --> 12:56.539
_

12:56.696 --> 12:58.415
_

12:59.329 --> 13:00.829
_

13:19.058 --> 13:20.941
It has begun.

13:49.555 --> 13:52.923
Had to go all the way to Olney,
but I found white willow bark.

14:01.567 --> 14:03.934
Afraid it won't do any good now.

14:06.105 --> 14:08.272
I'll leave you two alone.

14:13.663 --> 14:15.780
Wil...

14:15.782 --> 14:17.865
Hey, Mom.

14:17.867 --> 14:19.950
You hang in there, I've
got something new to try.

14:19.952 --> 14:22.670
I promise, this will ease your pain.

14:22.672 --> 14:24.038
Always...

14:24.040 --> 14:25.339
such a...

14:25.341 --> 14:27.625
a sweet boy.

14:27.627 --> 14:29.794
So much... I need...

14:29.796 --> 14:32.012
to tell you.

14:32.014 --> 14:33.931
Open it.

14:40.857 --> 14:42.807
They're Elfstones.

14:42.809 --> 14:45.860
Belonged... to your father.

14:46.779 --> 14:48.813
They're magic.

14:50.116 --> 14:51.649
I know you thought...

14:52.819 --> 14:55.786
your father was crazy...

14:55.788 --> 14:59.573
but he was... a good man.

14:59.575 --> 15:03.461
He believed in those.

15:06.332 --> 15:08.999
Mom, you're not making any sense.

15:10.503 --> 15:13.304
My precious... boy...

15:19.979 --> 15:23.981
find... the Druid.

15:25.351 --> 15:28.986
Find... the Druid.

15:28.988 --> 15:31.405
Promise me.

15:34.527 --> 15:36.994
No, Mom, don't leave me.

15:36.996 --> 15:39.747
No, Mom, I'm not ready.

16:04.941 --> 16:08.275
She always loved this spot.

16:08.277 --> 16:11.278
Said she could see the
whole world from here.

16:12.982 --> 16:14.865
I'm sorry, Wil.

16:18.704 --> 16:22.206
Hey, um, Uncle Flick...

16:22.208 --> 16:23.874
have you ever seen these before?

16:26.712 --> 16:28.796
Mom called 'em Elfstones.

16:30.917 --> 16:32.633
I told her to bury those damn things

16:32.635 --> 16:34.668
after your father died.

16:34.670 --> 16:36.420
Why?

16:37.473 --> 16:40.090
Because they put him in an early grave.

16:40.092 --> 16:43.060
He was never the same
person after he used 'em.

16:44.430 --> 16:45.813
Used 'em?

16:45.815 --> 16:49.183
Wait, you're not seriously
telling me you believe in magic.

16:49.185 --> 16:52.519
I believe in evil, Wil,

16:52.521 --> 16:53.571
and those things

16:53.573 --> 16:55.606
will bring you nothing but misery.

16:55.608 --> 16:57.191
Do yourself a favor,
throw them in the river

16:57.193 --> 16:59.944
and be done with 'em.

16:59.946 --> 17:01.829
I'm sorry.

17:33.145 --> 17:34.145
Someone's here to see you.

17:34.170 --> 17:36.030
I told the Home Guard
not to let anyone in.

17:36.032 --> 17:39.450
That's why Catania
helped me avoid them.

17:39.452 --> 17:41.235
If you won't tell me what's going on,

17:41.237 --> 17:43.988
maybe you'll talk to him.

17:43.990 --> 17:45.823
You owe me.

17:45.825 --> 17:47.992
You didn't need to check up on me.

17:47.994 --> 17:50.160
You passed out in front of the Ellcrys.

17:50.162 --> 17:51.378
I was worried about you.

17:51.380 --> 17:53.213
I'm fine.

17:53.215 --> 17:55.382
Then why have you locked
yourself up in here?

17:55.384 --> 17:58.002
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

18:01.757 --> 18:02.890
Is that one me?

18:04.427 --> 18:05.643
Oh, oh...

18:05.645 --> 18:07.645
You definitely got the ears right.

18:07.647 --> 18:10.014
Come on. Hey.

18:14.020 --> 18:16.070
Can I ask you something crazy

18:16.072 --> 18:18.439
but you have to promise not to laugh?

18:18.441 --> 18:20.190
Yeah.

18:20.192 --> 18:23.444
Do you think the story
of the Ellcrys is true?

18:23.446 --> 18:25.696
You mean the part where it's a barrier

18:25.698 --> 18:27.998
holding back a Demon army?

18:29.785 --> 18:31.201
Come on, Amberle,

18:31.203 --> 18:35.422
we both know magic died
out with the Druids.

18:35.424 --> 18:37.875
Yeah, you're right.

18:37.877 --> 18:40.044
Forget I asked.

18:43.716 --> 18:47.051
Come to the celebration tonight.

18:47.053 --> 18:50.688
People need to see you.

18:50.690 --> 18:52.606
I need to see you.

18:54.060 --> 18:58.062
Leave your demons behind
and come and celebrate.

19:19.051 --> 19:20.884
You just buried your ma.

19:20.886 --> 19:23.170
Now is not the time to be
making reckless decisions

19:23.172 --> 19:24.888
about your future.

19:24.890 --> 19:27.141
I know my future's not here.

19:27.143 --> 19:29.259
That's the Elfstones talking.

19:30.346 --> 19:32.062
Give me a little credit, Uncle Flick.

19:32.064 --> 19:33.647
I threw those things
away like you said.

19:33.649 --> 19:37.351
I'm moving to Storlock
to train as a healer.

19:37.353 --> 19:39.103
You've never been more than

19:39.105 --> 19:41.438
five miles outside of Shady Vale.

19:41.440 --> 19:44.274
The world outside is dangerous, Wil.

19:44.276 --> 19:46.944
It's full of Gnomes and
Trolls and Rovers.

19:46.946 --> 19:48.579
They all hate each other.

19:48.581 --> 19:51.698
The only thing they have in
common is they hate Elves more.

19:52.785 --> 19:55.502
I'll keep my ears covered...
just like always.

19:55.504 --> 19:57.504
You're the same as your father.

19:57.506 --> 20:00.090
Never happy with your
place in the world.

20:01.460 --> 20:03.293
What is that suppose to mean?

20:03.295 --> 20:05.796
Stay in Shady Vale.

20:05.798 --> 20:07.131
Let me talk to Dax.

20:07.133 --> 20:09.133
I'm sure he could use an apprentice.

20:09.135 --> 20:11.602
Dax couldn't heal a stubbed toe.

20:11.604 --> 20:14.471
Storlock has the best
healers in the Four Lands.

20:14.473 --> 20:16.690
Wil...

20:16.692 --> 20:19.359
you did everything you
could for your ma.

20:21.897 --> 20:24.148
It wasn't enough.

20:26.152 --> 20:28.702
I never want to feel
that helpless again.

21:52.571 --> 21:54.071
Uncle Ander.

21:54.073 --> 21:56.373
Thanks for the save.

21:56.375 --> 21:59.710
The Gauntlet's easier to
navigate than this party.

21:59.712 --> 22:01.245
Just don't faint again
and you'll be fine.

22:01.247 --> 22:02.963
My fainting days are over.

22:02.965 --> 22:04.748
Good, because as you can see,

22:04.750 --> 22:07.417
there are a lot of people who
are very eager to meet you.

22:09.555 --> 22:11.555
Grandpa still hasn't spoken to me.

22:11.557 --> 22:12.923
Don't worry about it.

22:12.925 --> 22:14.925
You know, sometimes I
think the only member

22:14.927 --> 22:17.928
of the family that he
actually likes is Manx.

22:21.600 --> 22:23.767
Speaking of loyal dogs,

22:23.769 --> 22:25.185
how's your boyfriend?

22:25.187 --> 22:27.437
Be nice.

22:29.074 --> 22:30.607
Lorin's a good guy.

22:30.609 --> 22:34.611
He deserves someone
who truly loves him.

22:34.613 --> 22:37.164
I'm just not sure that someone is me.

22:38.117 --> 22:39.917
Well, then you'd better tell him

22:39.919 --> 22:41.952
or else you're going to spend
a very awkward year together

22:41.954 --> 22:43.453
in the Sanctuary.

22:46.425 --> 22:48.425
Not nearly as awkward
as watching you pine

22:48.427 --> 22:50.010
for Commander Tilton.

22:50.012 --> 22:51.295
No...

22:51.297 --> 22:53.597
No, I'm not pining, I'm...

22:53.599 --> 22:55.299
I'm observing.

22:57.052 --> 22:59.303
That's been over for a very long time.

23:00.723 --> 23:03.523
And I think we can both agree
she made the wiser choice.

23:10.866 --> 23:12.649
Happy hunting.

23:22.494 --> 23:25.329
I need you.

23:29.551 --> 23:32.085
You look absolutely amazing.

23:32.087 --> 23:34.888
Thanks.

23:37.142 --> 23:38.642
Would you like to dance?

23:40.145 --> 23:41.478
I just need some food.

23:41.480 --> 23:43.180
I haven't eaten all day.

23:43.182 --> 23:44.815
I'll make you a plate.

24:20.469 --> 24:23.353
Closer.

24:43.409 --> 24:44.541
Lorin!

24:51.133 --> 24:52.916
Why?

25:13.772 --> 25:15.322
Stay back!

25:18.610 --> 25:20.610
What are you doing out here?

25:20.612 --> 25:22.913
The Ellcrys called to me.

25:24.950 --> 25:26.783
I heard it during the Gauntlet
and then again tonight.

25:26.785 --> 25:28.618
I tried to ignore it,
but it won't let me.

25:28.620 --> 25:31.955
Amberle, you're not making any sense.

25:31.957 --> 25:34.958
When I touch the tree,
it shows me visions...

25:36.378 --> 25:38.462
horrible visions of the future.

25:38.464 --> 25:40.430
Like what?

25:41.633 --> 25:44.434
That I'm going to kill you, Lorin.

25:44.436 --> 25:46.553
Kill me?

25:46.555 --> 25:48.472
I saw it.

25:48.474 --> 25:50.474
I stabbed you.

25:53.362 --> 25:55.028
I don't know what to think anymore.

25:55.030 --> 25:56.947
I should never have run the Gauntlet.

26:00.152 --> 26:02.035
I have to leave Arborlon.

26:02.037 --> 26:04.988
There's only one person
who can help me.

26:07.659 --> 26:10.544
- Calm down.
- No, I won't put you in danger.

26:10.546 --> 26:13.997
You need to stay as far
away from me as possible.

26:18.504 --> 26:20.003
Seriously?

26:27.146 --> 26:28.845
I'm sorry.

26:42.522 --> 26:44.772
Whoa!

26:50.657 --> 26:54.325
Well, so much for my shortcut.

26:54.327 --> 26:57.045
Hey, I don't like it
any more than you do.

26:59.416 --> 27:00.832
Great.

27:00.834 --> 27:02.750
Now I'm the guy who talks to his horse.

28:18.495 --> 28:21.462
I thought Elves were
supposed to be smart.

28:21.464 --> 28:22.914
I'm half-Elf.

28:24.801 --> 28:26.217
Clearly the wrong half.

28:26.219 --> 28:28.886
Only an idiot would
travel these woods alone.

28:28.888 --> 28:30.254
Trolls hunt here.

28:31.891 --> 28:33.975
Wait, that's a Troll?!

28:39.232 --> 28:41.065
Was a Troll.

28:47.190 --> 28:50.158
The Troll must have
picked up your scent.

28:50.160 --> 28:53.411
I hear Elf ears are
their favorite snacks.

29:04.290 --> 29:06.624
Huh.

29:06.626 --> 29:08.342
Even short tips.

29:08.344 --> 29:09.844
If you're going to keep insulting me,

29:09.846 --> 29:12.013
I should at least know your name.

29:15.351 --> 29:17.185
Eretria.

29:18.605 --> 29:20.021
I'm Wil.

29:20.023 --> 29:22.473
Thanks for saving my life.

29:33.653 --> 29:35.319
Hey, wait up.

30:07.020 --> 30:09.353
Prince Ander, any word on Amberle?

30:09.355 --> 30:12.190
The Black Watch are still
sweeping the countryside.

30:12.192 --> 30:14.025
I wish there was something I could do.

30:14.027 --> 30:15.276
You can start by telling the truth.

30:15.278 --> 30:17.028
I told Prince Arion everything.

30:18.031 --> 30:20.114
See, I'm an excellent liar,

30:20.116 --> 30:23.034
which means I can tell when
somebody's lying to me.

30:24.204 --> 30:26.120
Amberle left the party upset

30:26.122 --> 30:27.705
and you followed her out here.

30:27.707 --> 30:29.924
You two got into a fight...

30:29.926 --> 30:31.876
and now she's missing.

30:31.878 --> 30:33.711
As far as I'm concerned,

30:33.713 --> 30:35.930
I'm staring at the prime suspect.

30:35.932 --> 30:39.133
She said the Ellcrys called to her

30:39.135 --> 30:41.769
and showed her a vision of the future.

30:41.771 --> 30:43.971
In it... she killed me.

30:43.973 --> 30:46.607
You honestly expect me
to believe that the tree

30:46.609 --> 30:47.725
was communicating with her?

30:47.727 --> 30:48.893
I know it sounds crazy.

30:48.895 --> 30:50.945
That's why I didn't say anything.

30:54.234 --> 30:56.901
You better pray she's still alive.

31:37.143 --> 31:40.311
Hey, what do you think that was?

31:40.313 --> 31:42.480
Don't know, don't care.

31:42.482 --> 31:44.682
Aren't you curious
about ancient humans?

31:44.684 --> 31:46.684
How they were able to build
these incredible things?

31:46.686 --> 31:48.820
Look, they're dead, we're not.

31:48.822 --> 31:50.488
End of story.

31:53.193 --> 31:55.660
Anyone ever tell you
you're kind of cynical?

31:55.662 --> 31:58.663
Anyone ever tell you
you're kind of naive?

32:02.785 --> 32:04.585
- What is it?
- Not sure.

32:04.587 --> 32:07.038
Some kind of fungus or bark rot.

32:07.040 --> 32:09.040
The Ellcrys is sick?

32:09.042 --> 32:11.759
When's the last time that happened?

32:11.761 --> 32:13.044
Never.

32:14.514 --> 32:16.380
So you don't recall any accounts

32:16.382 --> 32:19.467
of the Ellcrys ever having been sick?

32:19.469 --> 32:21.886
It's never even shed a leaf.

32:35.034 --> 32:37.785
I understand the symbolic
importance of the Ellcrys,

32:37.787 --> 32:40.454
Father, but it is, after
all, only just a tree.

32:40.456 --> 32:42.240
The Ellcrys

32:42.242 --> 32:44.625
is more than just a tree.

32:44.627 --> 32:47.495
I can assure you of that, boy.

32:50.250 --> 32:51.582
Stop there!

32:51.584 --> 32:53.251
How did you get passed the Home Guard?

32:55.588 --> 32:59.724
Eventine, please tell
your son I mean no harm.

33:01.094 --> 33:03.427
Allanon?

33:06.266 --> 33:08.766
Put down your sword, boy.

33:18.695 --> 33:21.746
It has been a long time, my old friend.

33:23.499 --> 33:26.584
Father... Father, who is this Human?

33:26.586 --> 33:29.287
This is Allanon...

33:29.289 --> 33:31.622
the last Druid of Paranor.

33:33.293 --> 33:35.710
Druid?

33:35.712 --> 33:38.212
You said the last Druid died
in the War of the Races.

33:38.214 --> 33:40.715
Did you now?

33:40.717 --> 33:43.301
No one has set eyes on you in 30 years.

33:43.303 --> 33:44.852
I assumed the worst...

33:44.854 --> 33:47.972
but it appears you have
not aged a single day.

33:51.978 --> 33:53.811
I have been called by the Ellcrys.

33:53.813 --> 33:56.647
I must go to the Sanctuary immediately.

33:57.650 --> 33:59.951
If you really are a Druid...

34:03.323 --> 34:05.323
prove it.

34:05.325 --> 34:07.458
Show us some magic.

34:09.829 --> 34:11.661
I don't do tricks.

34:14.250 --> 34:15.833
Let him go.

34:17.503 --> 34:20.670
If Allanon is here...

34:20.672 --> 34:24.007
there are dark days ahead.

34:34.187 --> 34:36.687
This is your house?

34:36.688 --> 34:39.273
You're welcome to camp
out with the Trolls.

34:39.275 --> 34:41.525
I didn't picture someone like you

34:41.527 --> 34:43.777
living in a place so...

34:43.780 --> 34:46.496
woodsy.

34:46.498 --> 34:48.866
Take off your clothes
before you come in.

34:48.868 --> 34:51.202
All of them.

34:51.204 --> 34:52.585
You're joking, right?

34:52.588 --> 34:55.373
No. You need a bath.

34:55.375 --> 34:56.706
And I don't want you tracking mud

34:56.708 --> 34:59.377
all over my "woodsy" little house.

35:16.646 --> 35:18.863
So, uh, you live here alone?

35:18.865 --> 35:22.450
Don't worry, we won't be disturbed.

35:45.224 --> 35:46.974
Mmm.

35:49.429 --> 35:52.563
So aren't you worried about Rovers?

35:52.565 --> 35:54.765
What do you know about Rovers?

35:54.767 --> 35:57.485
One look at you and they'd
take the clothes off your back

35:57.487 --> 36:00.071
and steal your little
bag of blue rocks.

36:07.497 --> 36:08.946
I need those back.

36:08.948 --> 36:10.114
Why?

36:10.116 --> 36:12.616
Are they valuable?

36:12.618 --> 36:14.452
Only to me.

36:15.872 --> 36:19.123
Someone's got a little secret.

36:19.125 --> 36:23.127
What's it going to take
for you to tell me?

36:24.630 --> 36:27.598
They're called Elfstones.

36:27.600 --> 36:30.017
They belonged to my dad.

36:30.019 --> 36:32.636
They're supposed to
have magical powers.

36:37.643 --> 36:39.560
They're very pretty.

36:39.562 --> 36:41.979
Compared to you, I hadn't noticed.

36:44.617 --> 36:46.817
I'm sorry.

36:48.154 --> 36:50.488
I'm the one who should apologize.

36:50.490 --> 36:53.124
For what?

36:53.126 --> 36:57.044
The epic headache you're
gonna have in the morning.

37:17.016 --> 37:19.183
It's much worse than I thought.

37:21.354 --> 37:23.020
The Ellcrys is dying.

37:26.692 --> 37:28.192
Are you certain?

37:29.695 --> 37:32.196
You need to mobilize the Elven army.

37:32.198 --> 37:34.748
Why does a dying tree require an army?

37:34.750 --> 37:37.701
You do know the story of
the Ellcrys, don't you?

37:37.703 --> 37:40.504
Each leaf represents a single Demon.

37:40.506 --> 37:43.340
Once they begin to fall,
the creatures of darkness

37:43.342 --> 37:45.843
will be released from the
Forbidding, one by one.

37:45.845 --> 37:48.345
We all know that story
is just a fairy tale.

37:48.347 --> 37:51.632
Father, you're not actually
listening to this, are you?

37:51.634 --> 37:52.800
You've allowed him to believe this

37:52.802 --> 37:54.435
when you know the opposite to be true.

37:54.437 --> 37:56.470
After the War of the Races,

37:56.472 --> 37:58.439
I believed that magic had disappeared,

37:58.441 --> 38:00.107
along with you and the Warlock Lord.

38:00.109 --> 38:01.609
Well, then you tell that to your people

38:01.611 --> 38:05.196
when the fairy tales are
ripping out their throats!

39:25.126 --> 39:26.642
_

39:26.860 --> 39:28.274
_

39:28.734 --> 39:31.312
_

39:31.715 --> 39:36.293
_

39:44.247 --> 39:47.786
_

39:47.848 --> 39:51.106
_

40:36.882 --> 40:38.048
Get dressed, Wil.

40:38.050 --> 40:41.218
How do you know my name?
Where's Eretria?

40:41.220 --> 40:43.937
Your Rover girl is long gone.

40:43.939 --> 40:46.357
Rover? I don't understand.

40:46.359 --> 40:47.725
This is her house.

40:47.727 --> 40:49.393
No, it's not.

40:49.395 --> 40:51.061
It's theirs.

40:52.031 --> 40:54.865
Oh... I'm an idiot.

40:54.867 --> 40:56.200
You'll get no argument from me.

40:56.202 --> 40:58.952
You were supposed to be in Shady Vale.

40:58.954 --> 41:01.288
Did my uncle send you to bring me home?

41:01.290 --> 41:03.824
Flick had no intention of
telling me your whereabouts.

41:03.826 --> 41:06.410
But his thoughts were
never hard to read.

41:06.412 --> 41:08.128
What...

41:08.130 --> 41:10.581
Who exactly are you?

41:10.583 --> 41:12.132
I am Allanon.

41:12.134 --> 41:13.917
We must reach Druids' Keep.

41:13.919 --> 41:16.387
Wait, you're a Druid?

41:17.423 --> 41:19.423
Right before my mom passed away,

41:19.425 --> 41:21.225
she told me I needed to find you.

41:22.395 --> 41:24.228
Perhaps you should
have listened to her.

41:24.230 --> 41:26.680
You would have saved
us both a lot of time.

41:26.682 --> 41:29.433
She gave me these Elfstones...

41:32.521 --> 41:35.522
That...

41:35.524 --> 41:37.241
The Rover stole those too.

41:37.243 --> 41:39.109
This is going to be
harder than I thought.

41:39.111 --> 41:42.446
You have put our quest in jeopardy.

41:43.616 --> 41:45.749
What quest?

41:45.751 --> 41:47.501
What quest?!

41:54.627 --> 41:58.846
I can't believe this is the
Shannara I've been dealt.

42:00.466 --> 42:03.300
That's my horse!

42:03.302 --> 42:05.269
Hey...

42:06.939 --> 42:08.472
Yes! Hey.

42:08.474 --> 42:11.442
The Four Lands is in grave danger.

42:11.444 --> 42:14.228
Only the last son of
Shannara can save it.

42:14.230 --> 42:16.730
My name's Wil Ohmsford.

42:16.732 --> 42:18.148
You've got the wrong guy.

42:18.150 --> 42:20.200
You're a Shannara.

42:20.202 --> 42:23.620
Your ancestors were
kings and warriors...

42:23.622 --> 42:27.074
heroes who lived and died
defending the Four Lands.

42:27.076 --> 42:28.876
Men like your father.

42:30.963 --> 42:33.046
My father was a deadbeat drunk

42:33.048 --> 42:34.998
who died alone and destitute.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.967
You've been lied to.

42:39.171 --> 42:41.638
Do you believe in magic, boy?

42:41.640 --> 42:43.056
Of course not.

42:43.058 --> 42:45.309
Well, magic flowed through your father.

42:45.311 --> 42:48.345
And it flows through you too.

42:50.015 --> 42:52.232
It's in the Shannara blood.

42:53.152 --> 42:55.185
If I had magic inside me,

42:55.187 --> 42:58.021
why didn't it help me save my mom?

42:59.158 --> 43:01.441
It could have...

43:01.443 --> 43:04.027
if you'd known how to unlock it.

43:05.114 --> 43:07.197
I can show you how.

43:14.256 --> 43:16.256
Come.

43:17.259 --> 43:19.376
Your destiny awaits.

43:38.385 --> 43:42.225
_

44:05.678 --> 44:09.483
_

44:20.169 --> 44:25.950
_

44:25.975 --> 44:29.153
_

44:44.044 --> 44:48.411
_

44:48.436 --> 44:52.234
_

45:25.416 --> 45:27.332
Next one goes straight
through your heart!

45:30.421 --> 45:31.703
Who are you?

45:32.873 --> 45:34.706
I mean no harm.

45:34.708 --> 45:35.791
Please.

45:35.793 --> 45:38.760
I saw your fire and was
hoping to warm myself.

45:39.963 --> 45:42.547
You're the second Elf
I've run into this week.

45:42.549 --> 45:44.716
Actually, the first was a mongrel.

45:44.718 --> 45:47.602
Cute but not too bright.

45:50.140 --> 45:52.391
Where are you headed all by yourself?

45:52.393 --> 45:55.060
To the Elvin mission in Culhaven.

45:59.783 --> 46:01.400
I'm a teacher.

46:02.903 --> 46:04.619
You pack light.

46:05.989 --> 46:08.573
Unlike you.

46:10.411 --> 46:12.744
My husband found work near Balinor.

46:15.132 --> 46:17.466
I had to pack up my stuff
and meet him there.

46:31.348 --> 46:32.764
Thank you.

46:38.939 --> 46:41.106
You have no wedding band.

46:43.077 --> 46:44.409
Not that I'm surprised.

46:44.411 --> 46:45.610
Who would want to marry a Rover?

46:48.949 --> 46:52.667
Well, your jewelry gave
you away too, Princess.

46:52.669 --> 46:53.869
I don't know of any teacher

46:53.871 --> 46:55.504
who wears the royal seal of Arborlon

46:55.506 --> 46:56.838
engraved on their cuff.

46:56.840 --> 46:59.708
What was your plan, drug
me and then rob me?

46:59.710 --> 47:00.876
I steal to survive.

47:00.878 --> 47:02.928
Don't try and justify your actions.

47:02.930 --> 47:05.368
You and your kind are a
blight on the Four Lands.

47:05.393 --> 47:09.017
Ouch. Does the arrogant attitude
also come on a silver platter?

47:09.019 --> 47:11.887
You wouldn't know the first
thing about my life.

47:11.889 --> 47:14.189
Well, you don't have an escort.

47:14.191 --> 47:15.891
My guess, you're running away,

47:15.893 --> 47:18.310
probably from a guy who
either broke your heart

47:18.312 --> 47:20.562
or knocked you up.

47:20.564 --> 47:23.365
Whatever your drama, it
doesn't even compare

47:23.367 --> 47:25.484
to what you're gonna have to face
out there in the real world.

47:25.486 --> 47:28.370
Thanks for that nugget of Rover wisdom.

47:28.372 --> 47:31.289
Amberle, I need you...

47:31.291 --> 47:32.491
come back.

47:34.044 --> 47:36.461
Afraid of the dark, Princess?

47:39.550 --> 47:41.716
Now who's the thief?

47:43.670 --> 47:46.304
Believe me, you got the
better end of that trade.

48:14.201 --> 48:15.534
There it is.

48:15.536 --> 48:17.419
Druids' Keep.

48:20.174 --> 48:22.541
I can't believe I rode
all night for this.

48:22.543 --> 48:24.125
For hundreds of years,

48:24.127 --> 48:26.678
this fortress was the
center of the Four Lands.

48:26.680 --> 48:29.297
The wisest men and
women from each race,

48:29.299 --> 48:30.765
they were called here

48:30.767 --> 48:33.552
to study and train in the art of magic.

48:35.222 --> 48:37.222
It's just a ruin.

48:43.614 --> 48:45.814
This is sacred ground, Wil.

48:45.816 --> 48:48.567
Don't touch anything.

48:52.656 --> 48:54.406
I don't know what
you're hoping to find,

48:54.408 --> 48:55.824
there's not much left.

48:55.826 --> 48:58.210
The Codex of Paranor is here.

48:58.212 --> 49:00.078
What exactly does a Codex look like?

49:00.080 --> 49:02.130
It's a book containing
the magical history

49:02.132 --> 49:03.582
of the Four Lands.

49:03.584 --> 49:05.417
If there is a way of
saving the Ellcrys,

49:05.419 --> 49:06.751
it will be found within its pages.

49:06.753 --> 49:09.004
Why don't you just call
it a book of magic?

49:09.006 --> 49:10.805
Is it a Druid requirement
that everything

49:10.807 --> 49:13.341
has to sound so mysterious?

49:30.577 --> 49:32.360
I spoke to Lorin.

49:32.362 --> 49:33.945
Amberle told him that the Ellcrys

49:33.947 --> 49:35.447
was communicating with her.

49:35.449 --> 49:37.532
Giving her visions of the future.

49:37.534 --> 49:40.785
I dismissed it until I
found this in her room.

49:47.127 --> 49:48.510
Demons?

49:48.512 --> 49:50.211
She sketched them before
the Druid showed up.

49:50.213 --> 49:52.297
It can't be a coincidence.

49:53.934 --> 49:55.800
Until we are certain,
I want all the Chosen

49:55.802 --> 49:57.519
and the entire Elvin Council

49:57.521 --> 49:59.104
taken to the palace for safety.

49:59.106 --> 50:02.023
Black Watch will guard
them night and day.

50:20.160 --> 50:22.127
My mentor told me that he hid the Codex

50:22.129 --> 50:24.546
in this chamber before the Keep fell.

50:25.749 --> 50:27.165
When was that?

50:27.167 --> 50:29.834
300 years ago.

50:29.836 --> 50:32.003
Wait, that would make you...

50:32.005 --> 50:34.306
way too old to be alive.

50:40.063 --> 50:42.230
My Uncle Flick was
right, this is crazy.

50:49.823 --> 50:51.773
The Codex is here.

50:51.775 --> 50:54.075
Good luck finding it.
I'm going to Storlock.

50:56.496 --> 50:59.164
You can't walk away
from your destiny, Wil.

50:59.166 --> 51:00.749
Watch me.

51:09.793 --> 51:12.093
You were never going to Storlock.

51:12.095 --> 51:15.714
The Elfstones were guiding you to me.

51:18.885 --> 51:20.769
You know it to be true.

51:33.483 --> 51:35.066
Don't move!

51:41.742 --> 51:44.042
Don't speak.

51:50.300 --> 51:53.301
Let your eyes bear witness!

52:18.278 --> 52:19.244
Whoa!

53:01.147 --> 53:03.147
Magic is real.

53:03.148 --> 53:04.480
Yes.

53:08.153 --> 53:10.319
Will I be able to do that?

53:11.906 --> 53:14.323
One day... maybe.

53:18.663 --> 53:21.664
Behold, the Codex of Paranor.

53:23.084 --> 53:25.468
Your hand...

53:25.470 --> 53:28.571
Magic always comes with a price, Wil.

53:28.573 --> 53:30.506
Never forget that.

53:36.681 --> 53:38.681
My ancient Druid's a little rusty.

53:38.683 --> 53:40.399
Maybe you can fill me in.

53:40.401 --> 53:43.236
"When the Ellcrys comes
to the end of its days,

53:43.238 --> 53:45.605
"a flower will bloom

53:45.607 --> 53:48.191
"that will bear a single seed.

53:48.193 --> 53:50.276
"A member of the Chosen

53:50.278 --> 53:54.330
"must carry that seed to Safehold

53:54.332 --> 53:57.667
"and immerse it in the Bloodfire.

53:57.669 --> 54:00.870
"Only then can the seed be returned

54:00.872 --> 54:02.538
"to the Sanctuary

54:02.540 --> 54:05.541
and the Ellcrys be reborn."

54:05.543 --> 54:07.543
That doesn't sound so bad.

54:07.545 --> 54:10.880
It's not like you need a human
sacrifice or something.

54:10.882 --> 54:12.765
Where's Safehold?

54:12.767 --> 54:15.801
I've traveled all over these Four Lands

54:15.803 --> 54:18.054
and I've never come
across such a place.

54:20.391 --> 54:21.807
Perhaps...

54:47.740 --> 54:50.561
_

54:50.586 --> 54:52.186
_

54:52.211 --> 54:56.779
_

56:13.671 --> 56:16.005
Hey, Allanon! It's me, it's me!

56:20.478 --> 56:23.729
Wil, we must return to Arborlon.

56:23.731 --> 56:24.897
Hurry!

56:42.250 --> 56:44.500
- Amberle.
- I'm fine.

56:44.502 --> 56:46.585
Listen, the Ellcrys called to me again.

56:46.587 --> 56:48.671
We're all in great danger.

56:48.673 --> 56:50.873
- There's a Demon headed here.
- Demon?

56:50.875 --> 56:52.958
We have to warn the
Chosen, where are they?

56:52.960 --> 56:55.544
The king moved us to the
east wing of the palace.

56:55.546 --> 56:58.214
I snuck past the Black Watch
to check on the Ellcrys.

57:00.051 --> 57:03.052
I thought I'd lost you.
You have no idea.

57:39.090 --> 57:40.673
Demons in Arborlon?

57:40.675 --> 57:42.508
Never thought I would
live to see the day.

57:42.510 --> 57:45.061
The Chosen must be
protected at all costs.

57:45.063 --> 57:47.763
They alone can save the Ellcrys.

57:47.765 --> 57:50.900
The Black Watch should
be guarding that door!

58:04.115 --> 58:06.365
The Chosen... they're all dead.

58:06.367 --> 58:09.835
No... one still lives.

59:43.807 --> 59:45.640
This must be the work of Gnomes.

59:45.642 --> 59:47.926
They've struck at the heart
of the palace before.

59:49.012 --> 59:52.180
Gnomes had no part in this.

59:52.182 --> 59:54.265
It is the work of the Dagda Mor.

59:55.602 --> 59:57.018
The Dagda what?

59:57.020 --> 59:59.904
He's a powerful Elvin Druid

59:59.906 --> 01:00:01.606
who was corrupted by dark magic.

01:00:01.608 --> 01:00:05.743
He has been plotting his revenge
now for thousands of years.

01:00:05.745 --> 01:00:07.779
If he's a Druid, can't you find

01:00:07.781 --> 01:00:09.330
and destroy one of your own?

01:00:09.332 --> 01:00:10.448
I tried,

01:00:10.450 --> 01:00:13.001
but he is cloistered in a black henge

01:00:13.003 --> 01:00:15.336
which cloaks his location.

01:00:18.008 --> 01:00:19.257
I don't understand.

01:00:19.259 --> 01:00:20.959
If he really has escaped
the Forbidding,

01:00:20.961 --> 01:00:22.794
why doesn't he attack himself?

01:00:22.796 --> 01:00:24.629
According to the Codex,

01:00:24.631 --> 01:00:27.465
the weaker the Ellcrys gets,
the stronger he becomes.

01:00:29.185 --> 01:00:32.103
But he will not be truly
free to walk this Earth

01:00:32.105 --> 01:00:34.272
until the last leaf has fallen.

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:40.311
Kill the Chosen, kill the Ellcrys.

01:00:41.948 --> 01:00:43.982
Until then, he will dispatch his Demons

01:00:43.984 --> 01:00:47.151
to carry out his murderous biddings.

01:00:47.153 --> 01:00:49.120
Like he has done here.

01:00:49.122 --> 01:00:52.457
Can my father and I
please have the room?

01:01:13.229 --> 01:01:15.179
Father, you need to
send this Druid away.

01:01:15.181 --> 01:01:16.564
People are starting to talk,

01:01:16.566 --> 01:01:18.683
they don't understand why
you're under his thrall.

01:01:18.685 --> 01:01:21.903
You mean you don't understand.
No, I don't!

01:01:21.905 --> 01:01:24.188
Six innocent lives
have been slaughtered

01:01:24.190 --> 01:01:27.692
inside our walls and you want
to blame Demons and magic?

01:01:27.694 --> 01:01:29.660
What would you suggest?

01:01:32.699 --> 01:01:35.249
You had planned to step
down in a few months.

01:01:36.336 --> 01:01:38.252
Do it now.

01:01:38.254 --> 01:01:40.338
Let me take control of the situation.

01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:42.757
Let me do what I have
been training to do.

01:01:42.759 --> 01:01:46.377
I will lead the Elvin army and I
will root out our real enemy.

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:49.547
My son...

01:01:49.549 --> 01:01:52.683
a true leader does not abdicate

01:01:52.685 --> 01:01:54.719
at the start of a crisis.

01:01:54.721 --> 01:01:58.139
And as for your training, it
is no match for my experience.

01:01:58.141 --> 01:01:59.390
By the time I was your age,

01:01:59.392 --> 01:02:01.109
I had won the War of the Races

01:02:01.111 --> 01:02:03.227
and I brought peace to the Four Lands.

01:02:04.614 --> 01:02:07.565
You are the greatest king
since Jerle Shannara.

01:02:09.569 --> 01:02:11.235
But...

01:02:15.875 --> 01:02:17.575
But think of your legacy.

01:02:17.577 --> 01:02:21.045
After everything that you have
done for the Elven people,

01:02:21.047 --> 01:02:23.047
do you really want to go down

01:02:23.049 --> 01:02:25.249
as the mad king who believes in Demons?

01:02:35.512 --> 01:02:38.096
If Princess Amberle is
the last of the Chosen,

01:02:38.098 --> 01:02:39.597
how come the tree can't find her?

01:02:39.599 --> 01:02:41.399
The Ellcrys has called to her,

01:02:41.401 --> 01:02:43.935
but she needs to return voluntarily.

01:02:43.937 --> 01:02:45.603
Nobody can be forced into service.

01:02:45.605 --> 01:02:48.906
Can't you use your magic like
you did at Druids' Keep?

01:02:48.908 --> 01:02:50.274
Finding a dusty old book

01:02:50.276 --> 01:02:52.360
is much easier than
tracking a willful girl

01:02:52.362 --> 01:02:55.279
who doesn't want to be found.

01:02:55.281 --> 01:02:58.282
I need you to search the
princess's quarters.

01:02:58.284 --> 01:03:00.418
Don't tell anyone of your mission.

01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:03.454
Dagda Mor has an agent
within these walls.

01:03:03.456 --> 01:03:06.290
And, Wil, don't screw up.

01:03:06.292 --> 01:03:09.510
If the Dagda Mor finds
Amberle before we do...

01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:13.047
the world ends.

01:03:13.049 --> 01:03:14.432
Great.

01:03:14.434 --> 01:03:17.301
Thanks for the encouragement.

01:03:29.282 --> 01:03:31.199
Ignore Iggy.

01:03:33.153 --> 01:03:35.453
Use him to scare the
bark nuts off any Rover

01:03:35.455 --> 01:03:37.572
that comes sniffing around.

01:03:37.574 --> 01:03:39.790
Aunt Pyria?

01:03:46.666 --> 01:03:50.468
You are the spitting
image of your mother.

01:03:50.470 --> 01:03:52.253
Now, what are you doing out here?

01:03:52.255 --> 01:03:54.672
You could have been
kidnapped or killed.

01:03:54.674 --> 01:03:56.257
I'm in trouble.

01:03:56.259 --> 01:03:58.142
I need your help.

01:03:59.312 --> 01:04:00.928
How far along are you?

01:04:00.930 --> 01:04:03.931
I'm not pregnant.

01:04:03.933 --> 01:04:06.234
In your letters...

01:04:06.236 --> 01:04:09.520
you said you witnessed magic
during the War of the Races.

01:04:11.908 --> 01:04:14.575
That was a very long time ago.

01:04:14.577 --> 01:04:17.195
But you still believe in it?

01:04:17.197 --> 01:04:19.697
What is really going on, Amberle?

01:04:20.833 --> 01:04:22.366
I ran the Gauntlet...

01:04:23.536 --> 01:04:25.169
and won.

01:04:25.171 --> 01:04:26.537
I became a member of the Chosen.

01:04:26.539 --> 01:04:29.173
Your grandfather must be furious.

01:04:29.175 --> 01:04:32.510
- Good for you.
- No, it's a nightmare.

01:04:32.512 --> 01:04:35.213
When I laid my hand on the Ellcrys,

01:04:35.215 --> 01:04:37.181
I had a vision...

01:04:37.183 --> 01:04:39.383
Arborlon in flames,

01:04:39.385 --> 01:04:42.720
Demons feasting on the dead.

01:04:42.722 --> 01:04:45.473
It was a vision of the future,

01:04:45.475 --> 01:04:48.559
a future that's going to happen
because I broke the rules.

01:04:48.561 --> 01:04:51.445
You need to help me stop it.

01:05:11.584 --> 01:05:14.585
Look what I caught.

01:05:21.394 --> 01:05:23.144
Come on! Choke!

01:05:24.764 --> 01:05:27.064
Eretria!

01:05:27.066 --> 01:05:28.432
Eretria!

01:05:30.103 --> 01:05:31.235
That's enough!

01:05:44.450 --> 01:05:46.584
We scouted that house four nights ago.

01:05:46.586 --> 01:05:48.502
I was beginning to think
you'd double-crossed me.

01:05:48.504 --> 01:05:50.454
And risk you putting
a bounty on my head

01:05:50.456 --> 01:05:53.374
with every Rover in the Four Lands?

01:05:53.376 --> 01:05:55.876
Thanks for the trust.

01:05:55.878 --> 01:05:58.879
Where's your haul?

01:05:58.881 --> 01:06:01.465
I stripped the place clean,
just as you taught me,

01:06:01.467 --> 01:06:04.685
but I got ambushed on the way back.

01:06:04.687 --> 01:06:06.721
Ambushed?

01:06:06.723 --> 01:06:09.307
They stole my haul with my horse.

01:06:09.309 --> 01:06:10.691
Trolls would've eaten you.

01:06:10.693 --> 01:06:12.393
Gnomes would've gutted you.

01:06:12.395 --> 01:06:14.362
Who was it, another Rover clan?

01:06:15.815 --> 01:06:16.864
An Elf.

01:06:16.866 --> 01:06:19.617
An Elf?

01:06:19.619 --> 01:06:21.319
Well, you should have killed
the arrogant little snot,

01:06:21.321 --> 01:06:22.620
cut off its pointy ears,

01:06:22.622 --> 01:06:25.373
and brought them to me as a souvenir!

01:06:25.375 --> 01:06:27.325
Guess you're not cut out
for a heist after all.

01:06:27.327 --> 01:06:29.377
It was my first time going solo.

01:06:29.379 --> 01:06:31.662
Just give me another shot.

01:06:35.084 --> 01:06:37.385
This is a clan, not a charity.

01:06:37.387 --> 01:06:39.887
I'm selling you to Boca Madrid.

01:06:39.889 --> 01:06:42.807
He wants a wife and he's had
his eye on you for a while.

01:06:46.679 --> 01:06:48.479
Cephalo, wait!

01:06:48.481 --> 01:06:50.481
I didn't come back empty-handed.

01:06:50.483 --> 01:06:52.516
But you've got to
promise not to sell me.

01:06:57.190 --> 01:06:59.940
They're one of a kind.

01:06:59.942 --> 01:07:03.194
I'm sure you could get
a good price for them.

01:07:03.196 --> 01:07:04.829
- Those are...
- Elfstones.

01:07:12.338 --> 01:07:13.704
There's nothing rarer.

01:07:15.425 --> 01:07:17.591
There may be hope for you.

01:07:18.928 --> 01:07:20.261
Come on, sweetheart.

01:07:20.263 --> 01:07:21.595
Why don't you tell your dad

01:07:21.597 --> 01:07:23.381
exactly how you got a hold of these?

01:07:47.842 --> 01:07:50.192
My son believes you're
leading me astray.

01:07:53.114 --> 01:07:55.197
I remember a younger king

01:07:55.199 --> 01:07:57.583
who wouldn't allow the
whispers of the doubters

01:07:57.585 --> 01:07:59.535
to cloud his judgment.

01:07:59.537 --> 01:08:02.588
Well, we can't all fall
asleep for decades

01:08:02.590 --> 01:08:07.376
and forget that the world
has moved on without us.

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:15.635
We found him trespassing
in the princess's room.

01:08:15.637 --> 01:08:18.520
He insisted on seeing the Druid.

01:08:18.523 --> 01:08:19.721
Your Highness.

01:08:19.724 --> 01:08:22.224
I... I think I know where
Amberle is hiding.

01:08:22.225 --> 01:08:24.977
She's with somebody called Pyria.

01:08:24.979 --> 01:08:27.229
Pyria?

01:08:27.231 --> 01:08:29.198
No one has heard from
my sister for years.

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:32.234
According to these letters,
she lives in Wing Hove.

01:08:34.205 --> 01:08:36.205
Amberle was secretly
corresponding with her.

01:08:36.207 --> 01:08:38.541
I found them hidden in her room.

01:08:38.542 --> 01:08:40.960
Why would the princess
need to write in secret

01:08:40.962 --> 01:08:43.328
to her aunt?

01:08:43.331 --> 01:08:45.747
We had a falling out many years ago.

01:08:47.585 --> 01:08:50.386
She fell in love with a Human.

01:08:50.388 --> 01:08:54.140
And when she asked for
my blessing, I refused.

01:08:54.142 --> 01:08:56.425
Because she didn't love an Elf?

01:08:58.179 --> 01:09:00.145
Because she loved you, Allanon.

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:05.734
I thought she understood that
there was no future for us.

01:09:07.270 --> 01:09:10.106
Well, evidently, she didn't.

01:09:10.108 --> 01:09:14.743
However, thanks to your very
capable young apprentice here,

01:09:14.746 --> 01:09:17.997
we now have our best chance of
getting Amberle home safely.

01:09:17.999 --> 01:09:21.082
I will instruct the scouts
to go to Wing Hove.

01:09:21.085 --> 01:09:22.618
No.

01:09:25.622 --> 01:09:28.624
Wil and I will go... alone.

01:09:28.626 --> 01:09:30.876
We will?

01:09:30.877 --> 01:09:33.595
Inviting a few soldiers
might not be a bad idea.

01:09:33.598 --> 01:09:37.183
Whatever killed the Chosen could
still be inside the city walls.

01:09:37.185 --> 01:09:39.352
Nobody else is to know
Amberle's location

01:09:39.354 --> 01:09:41.636
or her life could be in danger.

01:09:41.639 --> 01:09:43.522
As you wish.

01:09:50.648 --> 01:09:52.865
What do you think, old boy, hmm?

01:09:52.867 --> 01:09:55.151
What do you think?

01:10:01.459 --> 01:10:04.493
He said the Elfstones
belonged to his father.

01:10:04.495 --> 01:10:07.747
But even he didn't
believe they were magic.

01:10:07.749 --> 01:10:09.749
Maybe he was lying.

01:10:09.751 --> 01:10:13.002
Where did this halfling
say he was from?

01:10:13.004 --> 01:10:15.554
Someplace called Shady Vale.

01:10:19.093 --> 01:10:21.394
There used to be stories about

01:10:21.396 --> 01:10:22.895
an Elf who lived in the Vale.

01:10:22.897 --> 01:10:25.347
He'd gladly tell you
his wild tale of how

01:10:25.349 --> 01:10:27.600
he single-handedly won
the War of the Races

01:10:27.602 --> 01:10:29.735
with nothing but a magic sword

01:10:29.737 --> 01:10:32.571
and three humble Elfstones to aid him.

01:10:32.573 --> 01:10:34.774
Well, my father taught me
not to believe anything

01:10:34.776 --> 01:10:38.327
I didn't see with my own eyes.

01:10:38.329 --> 01:10:40.830
You think just because those
pointy-eared bastards

01:10:40.832 --> 01:10:44.250
tell us that magic's
dead, that's the truth?

01:10:44.252 --> 01:10:47.703
What makes you think I
haven't seen it, hmm?

01:10:47.705 --> 01:10:49.422
Find the halfling

01:10:49.424 --> 01:10:53.209
and I promise not to marry you off.

01:10:57.715 --> 01:10:59.882
I find him, you grant me my freedom.

01:11:42.894 --> 01:11:45.394
So you and the king's sister... Wow.

01:11:45.396 --> 01:11:48.814
I never pictured you
as the romantic type.

01:11:48.816 --> 01:11:52.067
My relationship with Pyria
is none of your concern.

01:11:52.069 --> 01:11:54.687
I'm sure the age difference
must have been kind of weird.

01:11:54.689 --> 01:11:56.689
How old are you, like 350?

01:11:56.691 --> 01:11:58.491
Stop talking. I can't.

01:11:58.493 --> 01:12:00.109
It's the only thing keeping
my mind off the fact

01:12:00.111 --> 01:12:03.496
that we could be ripped apart by
rampaging Demons at any moment.

01:12:03.498 --> 01:12:05.664
Nobody should die like that.

01:12:05.666 --> 01:12:07.283
Well, thanks to you, we have a chance

01:12:07.285 --> 01:12:09.285
of finding Amberle and stopping them.

01:12:09.287 --> 01:12:11.620
Whoa. Was that a compliment?

01:12:14.842 --> 01:12:16.792
I'm not much of a conversationalist.

01:12:16.794 --> 01:12:18.794
As you can tell, I don't
get much practice.

01:12:18.796 --> 01:12:20.629
If you don't want to talk about Pyria,

01:12:20.631 --> 01:12:22.431
at least tell me about my dad.

01:12:28.139 --> 01:12:31.640
I met Pyria because she was
keeper of the royal archives

01:12:31.642 --> 01:12:33.192
when I was tracking down descents

01:12:33.194 --> 01:12:34.810
of the Shannara bloodline.

01:12:34.812 --> 01:12:37.479
- How come?
- They were being murdered.

01:12:37.481 --> 01:12:39.815
Of course they were.

01:12:39.817 --> 01:12:42.318
I met your father when he was living

01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:44.537
in Shady Vale with the Ohmsfords.

01:12:44.539 --> 01:12:47.540
He and Flick were like brothers.

01:12:47.542 --> 01:12:50.376
- Brothers?
- No way.

01:12:50.378 --> 01:12:52.745
Uncle Flick refuses to talk about him.

01:12:52.747 --> 01:12:54.246
Your father is the only reason

01:12:54.248 --> 01:12:57.633
this world didn't fall into
darkness 30 years ago.

01:12:57.635 --> 01:13:01.503
His courage and fortitude
inspire me still.

01:13:03.224 --> 01:13:06.342
If he's such a hero, how
come nobody remembers him?

01:13:06.344 --> 01:13:09.011
Why did he die a sad, lonely drunk?

01:13:09.013 --> 01:13:10.596
Well, you might recall

01:13:10.598 --> 01:13:13.182
I told you that magic
comes with a price?

01:13:13.184 --> 01:13:15.768
Your father mastered the Elfstones,

01:13:15.770 --> 01:13:18.320
he defeated a terrible evil,

01:13:18.322 --> 01:13:20.990
and the magic... took its toll.

01:13:20.992 --> 01:13:24.410
Is that what's gonna happen to me?

01:13:24.412 --> 01:13:27.529
Magic affects each person differently.

01:13:27.531 --> 01:13:29.748
But you are not your father, Wil.

01:13:33.004 --> 01:13:34.753
So I'm supposed to use
Elfstones I don't have

01:13:34.755 --> 01:13:36.956
to protect a princess who
doesn't want to be found

01:13:36.958 --> 01:13:39.875
from a Demon horde bent on
laying waste to the world?

01:13:39.877 --> 01:13:43.045
And even if I succeed, which
is entirely doubtful,

01:13:43.047 --> 01:13:46.548
my life could still be doomed because
magic will have fried my brain.

01:13:47.768 --> 01:13:48.934
Mmm.

01:13:48.936 --> 01:13:51.186
I liked it better when we didn't talk.

01:14:47.904 --> 01:14:49.737
Allanon?

01:14:49.739 --> 01:14:52.039
We're here for Princess Amberle.

01:14:53.159 --> 01:14:55.159
I can't help you.

01:15:06.472 --> 01:15:08.339
She's at the waterfall.

01:15:09.475 --> 01:15:11.675
Damn your Druid tricks.

01:15:11.677 --> 01:15:14.311
Go now, time is precious.

01:15:22.188 --> 01:15:24.522
That's Shea's boy, isn't it?

01:15:26.109 --> 01:15:29.577
I'm not convinced he'll be
the man his father was.

01:15:40.173 --> 01:15:43.707
After all these years, here you are
standing right in front of me,

01:15:43.709 --> 01:15:46.710
looking like you haven't aged a day.

01:15:46.712 --> 01:15:49.180
How can that be?

01:15:49.182 --> 01:15:51.432
The Druids' sleep.

01:15:51.434 --> 01:15:55.052
A deep hibernation that
restored my magic.

01:15:55.054 --> 01:15:58.055
I was depleted after the war.

01:15:58.057 --> 01:16:01.192
I had no choice but to leave.

01:16:02.395 --> 01:16:03.944
No choice?

01:16:03.946 --> 01:16:06.397
You abandoned me to grow old

01:16:06.399 --> 01:16:08.649
without so much as a good-bye.

01:16:08.651 --> 01:16:12.403
And now you return as young and strong

01:16:12.405 --> 01:16:13.954
as a spring stag.

01:16:16.075 --> 01:16:18.742
Amberle told me about the Ellcrys

01:16:18.744 --> 01:16:20.377
and her visions.

01:16:20.379 --> 01:16:24.582
The situation is more
dire than she knows.

01:16:25.668 --> 01:16:27.751
If you're here, I should have guessed.

01:16:27.753 --> 01:16:30.171
And right now the destiny
of the Four Lands

01:16:30.173 --> 01:16:32.723
rests upon Wil and Amberle's shoulders.

01:16:32.725 --> 01:16:34.592
And once again...

01:16:34.594 --> 01:16:36.310
you are the puppet master,

01:16:36.312 --> 01:16:40.097
manipulating innocent
lives as you see fit.

01:16:57.667 --> 01:16:59.533
Princess Amberle!

01:16:59.535 --> 01:17:01.952
Princess Amberle!

01:17:11.848 --> 01:17:14.298
Princess Amberle!

01:17:40.877 --> 01:17:42.826
Uh-uh, eyes up here!

01:17:42.828 --> 01:17:44.495
I'm sorry.

01:17:44.497 --> 01:17:46.664
Who are you?

01:17:46.666 --> 01:17:48.299
Uh...

01:17:48.301 --> 01:17:49.884
You're an Elf?

01:17:49.886 --> 01:17:52.052
Half-Elf.

01:17:52.054 --> 01:17:54.755
And yes, they're small, so
spare me the ear jokes.

01:17:54.757 --> 01:17:56.807
How did you find me?

01:17:56.809 --> 01:17:57.892
Your letters to your aunt.

01:17:57.894 --> 01:17:59.977
You went through my things?

01:17:59.979 --> 01:18:03.814
Look, it's really important
you return to Arborlon.

01:18:05.685 --> 01:18:07.318
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

01:18:08.854 --> 01:18:11.021
This conversation would
be much less awkward

01:18:11.023 --> 01:18:13.741
if you were dressed.

01:18:14.911 --> 01:18:16.193
Turn around.

01:18:18.531 --> 01:18:20.197
Okay.

01:18:47.109 --> 01:18:48.442
Let's start over.

01:18:48.444 --> 01:18:50.861
Who the hell are you and
what are you doing here?

01:18:50.863 --> 01:18:52.396
My name is Wil Ohmsford.

01:18:52.398 --> 01:18:54.365
I'm here because the Ellcrys is dying

01:18:54.367 --> 01:18:56.567
and you are the only
one who can save it.

01:18:56.569 --> 01:18:57.901
The Ellcrys is dying?

01:18:57.903 --> 01:18:59.987
Yes, and I know the tree speaks to you.

01:18:59.989 --> 01:19:01.989
Did Lorin tell you that?

01:19:01.991 --> 01:19:03.907
Well, not exactly.

01:19:03.909 --> 01:19:06.377
What aren't you telling me?

01:19:06.379 --> 01:19:08.912
I think it's better if the
Druid explains everything.

01:19:11.083 --> 01:19:13.751
You're here with a Druid.

01:19:13.753 --> 01:19:15.336
I thought they were all dead.

01:19:15.338 --> 01:19:18.255
This one just took a very long nap.

01:19:18.257 --> 01:19:20.257
Are you his errand boy?

01:19:20.259 --> 01:19:21.925
Actually, Allanon brought me along

01:19:21.927 --> 01:19:24.845
to protect you.

01:19:24.847 --> 01:19:27.431
You're joking, right?

01:19:34.907 --> 01:19:36.240
When the sleep calls,

01:19:36.242 --> 01:19:38.325
there is no time for good-byes.

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:43.998
Being a Druid is not a choice.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.116
It's a calling.

01:19:46.118 --> 01:19:50.587
You will never know how sorry I am...

01:19:50.589 --> 01:19:53.457
or how much you still mean to me.

01:20:03.803 --> 01:20:05.135
A Fury.

01:20:07.306 --> 01:20:09.640
Stay behind me!

01:20:22.321 --> 01:20:23.737
Aunt Pyria!

01:20:23.739 --> 01:20:25.539
I think we should wait for Allanon.

01:20:28.661 --> 01:20:31.161
Aunt Pyria!

01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:37.000
Amberle!

01:20:49.849 --> 01:20:52.516
Amberle... stay back!
