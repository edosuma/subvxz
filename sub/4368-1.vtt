00:03.537 --> 00:06.074
<i>You are being watched.</i>

00:06.240 --> 00:08.220
<i>The government has a secret system,</i>

00:08.375 --> 00:12.755
<i>a machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.</i>
<b><font color="#0A7C32">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:12.913 --> 00:15.086
<i>I designed The Machine
to detect acts of terror</i>

00:15.249 --> 00:16.990
<i>but it sees everything,</i>

00:17.150 --> 00:20.495
<i>violent crimes
involving ordinary people.</i>

00:20.654 --> 00:25.501
<i>The government considers
these people irrelevant. We don't.</i>

00:25.659 --> 00:30.108
<i>Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.</i>

00:30.264 --> 00:32.403
<i>You'll never find us</i>

00:32.566 --> 00:37.572
<i>but victim or perpetrator
if your number's up, we'll find you.</i>

00:42.943 --> 00:44.263
What are you doing tomorrow?

00:44.287 --> 00:47.225
I'm serious.
We should do it again sometime.

00:47.347 --> 00:49.850
Band was good,
conversation was good,

00:50.017 --> 00:52.054
- You look fabulous.
- You're so sweet.

01:04.431 --> 01:07.537
Must be easy to get beautiful women
when you are a diplomat's son.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.203
She'll live.

01:11.538 --> 01:14.212
You, amigo,
you can blame your old man.

01:14.374 --> 01:16.650
- Hey.
- Huh?

01:16.810 --> 01:19.950
If your father had been smart enough
to work with the cartel

01:20.113 --> 01:22.313
you might have lived long
enough to kiss her good night.

01:22.337 --> 01:23.407
- Hey!
- What?

01:27.454 --> 01:31.903
- Who the hell are you?
- Tonight, hostage negotiator.

01:44.771 --> 01:47.308
- Raffi, come on.
- Man, you're crazy.

01:52.346 --> 01:55.589
Damn. You're welcome.

01:59.686 --> 02:03.156
- They never say thank you.
- Yeah, I wonder why.

02:04.291 --> 02:08.501
Maybe if you figure out a way to save
them before all hell breaks loose.

02:08.662 --> 02:12.633
Thanks, Caner.
You know, for what it's worth...

02:13.800 --> 02:15.802
...you're looking kind of badass
in that uniform.

02:15.969 --> 02:18.882
Yours is still the same
except the mask is new.

02:20.474 --> 02:23.114
So where are all your friends?

02:29.850 --> 02:31.022
Can I be honest?

02:33.053 --> 02:36.796
I only asked you out
because you're drop-dead gorgeous.

02:39.026 --> 02:41.529
But after sitting down,

02:41.695 --> 02:43.215
really getting to know you
over dinner,

02:43.239 --> 02:47.510
I realized I think you might be

02:47.668 --> 02:50.911
the most fascinating woman
I've ever met.

02:52.506 --> 02:55.180
Yeah, I bet you say that
to all the girls.

02:57.678 --> 03:01.683
In fact, I know you do.

03:01.815 --> 03:04.495
And after you get into their pants,
you get into their bank accounts

03:04.584 --> 03:06.188
just like you did
with Paula Scarlatti.

03:07.921 --> 03:10.731
Poor Paula was so heartbroken,
she told her mobbed-up old man.

03:10.891 --> 03:17.570
He and his gangster pals just put
a big fat bounty on your head.

03:17.731 --> 03:20.371
And can I be honest?

03:20.534 --> 03:22.878
I only went out with you
because of them.

03:27.374 --> 03:29.414
Hey, what are you doing?
You're gonna get me killed.

03:29.438 --> 03:31.008
What are you doing?

03:38.685 --> 03:40.631
Here's the deal, Don.

03:40.787 --> 03:44.132
You need to leave town,
change your name and get some game.

03:45.959 --> 03:47.097
Start now.

03:55.469 --> 03:57.509
I appreciate you
resolving this situation, Ms. Shaw.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.107
However, perhaps in the future,

03:59.272 --> 04:02.116
you might try to complete
your assignments

04:02.275 --> 04:03.948
without quite so much violence.

04:04.111 --> 04:06.614
You see what she did?
I'm not a human shield.

04:06.780 --> 04:07.860
No, he just got in the way.

04:07.981 --> 04:11.793
That's it. I'm not working
with a lunatic. I'm out.

04:16.656 --> 04:19.603
You know how to find me.

04:24.397 --> 04:26.237
Can't say we didn't already know,
Finch.

04:26.500 --> 04:28.980
First time we met, Shaw shot me.

04:29.136 --> 04:32.174
I realize that Ms. Shaw
is an effective asset

04:32.339 --> 04:33.939
but I'm not sure I can work
with somebody

04:33.963 --> 04:36.446
who refuses to carry a cell phone
off the job.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.647
People out there are trying
to kill her, you know.

04:38.812 --> 04:40.812
Some of the same people
that are trying to kill us.

04:41.815 --> 04:45.092
Yes, Machine still seems
to be giving them numbers.

04:45.252 --> 04:48.699
Whatever else it's up to is
almost too troubling to contemplate.

04:48.855 --> 04:51.802
Meantime, our latest number,

04:51.958 --> 04:56.202
petty officer second class
Jack Salazar, United States Navy.

04:56.363 --> 04:59.503
- Petty officer or petty criminal?
- Bit of both, I'm afraid.

04:59.666 --> 05:02.476
He assaulted a man during
a barroom brawl five years ago.

05:02.636 --> 05:05.378
He all but put the guy in a coma.

05:05.539 --> 05:08.349
The judge gave him a choice:
Jail or the military.

05:08.508 --> 05:11.182
And Jack chose the Navy.

05:12.813 --> 05:15.521
- So what's he doing here?
- Fleet Week.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.058
The annual deluge of drunken sailors

05:19.219 --> 05:22.166
that somehow does not qualify
as a military attack.

05:22.322 --> 05:26.566
Come on, Finch, it's just a bunch
of crackerjacks blowing off steam.

05:26.726 --> 05:28.246
<i>Then it's back to the boat
by midnight.</i>

05:28.270 --> 05:30.902
I'm afraid countless sailors
in uniform

05:31.064 --> 05:34.136
are going to complicate
our efforts to locate Mr. Salazar.

05:34.301 --> 05:36.747
If Jack's like most sailors,
it's booze, broads

05:36.903 --> 05:38.473
and a tattoo in that order.

05:38.638 --> 05:41.050
I suppose you know the usual haunts.

05:41.208 --> 05:44.382
Sure, it's two-for-one boilermakers
in Hell's Kitchen.

05:46.413 --> 05:48.552
That sounds horrible.

05:56.556 --> 05:58.229
Whiskey.

06:00.527 --> 06:05.943
- That's six bars down, Finch.
- Excellent. Only 1274 to go.

06:06.099 --> 06:09.945
- Another round?
- Only if you're buying, Jack.

06:10.103 --> 06:13.175
Wait a second.
Got eyes on our sailor, Finch.

06:15.575 --> 06:19.284
So there I am, separated from
my team, deep in North Korea

06:19.446 --> 06:22.893
with nothing but my buck knife
and my M9.

06:23.016 --> 06:24.791
Am I leaving anything out, Jack?

06:24.951 --> 06:28.421
Crocodiles, poisonous darts,
your sense of shame?

06:28.588 --> 06:29.589
I'm getting to that.

06:29.756 --> 06:31.963
Oh, my God.
What did you do?

06:32.125 --> 06:35.038
Baby, that's a long story
and I'm only here until midnight,

06:35.195 --> 06:39.974
so why don't we go someplace quiet
and I can tell you all about it?

06:40.133 --> 06:44.104
- Ashley, let's go.
- I think the lady wants to stay.

06:44.271 --> 06:47.252
- Screw you, jarhead.
- I'm not a jarhead, I'm a squid,

06:47.407 --> 06:50.479
but a tube steak like you
doesn't get to call me either.

06:50.744 --> 06:51.882
Leave it, RJ.

06:52.045 --> 06:54.491
We're here to have a good time.
Nobody wants trouble.

06:54.648 --> 06:56.252
<i>Somebody call somebody "jarheadâ€œ?</i>

06:58.418 --> 07:02.230
Look, man, don't do this.
Let me buy you guys a round.

07:02.389 --> 07:04.266
Yeah, I could use another.

07:11.831 --> 07:15.278
- You're gonna need to pick that up.
- Or what, squid?

07:15.435 --> 07:17.435
One of you split-tails
gonna do something about it?

07:18.238 --> 07:20.013
Well, he's gonna have
to take a swing at you.

07:20.173 --> 07:22.983
Then your knuckle-dragger
buddy over here is gonna jump me.

07:23.143 --> 07:26.522
After I introduce his face
to the bar,

07:26.680 --> 07:29.524
I'm gonna put this foot
upside of your jarhead.

07:29.683 --> 07:36.430
Upon which all hell breaks loose.
And nobody wants that.

07:38.258 --> 07:40.761
<i>- I like this guy, Finch.</i>
- Hm.

08:07.554 --> 08:10.967
Mr. Reese?
Everything all right?

08:11.124 --> 08:12.967
Yeah, just shore leave, Finch.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.365
Cops!
Let's get out of here!

08:20.800 --> 08:23.474
<i>Looks like I lost Jack.</i>

08:24.904 --> 08:27.064
Finch, how many squids are there
in the city right now?

08:27.088 --> 08:30.581
Uh, approximately 6,000.
Why do you ask?

08:30.744 --> 08:33.418
I think we're gonna need backup
just to find him.

08:34.914 --> 08:36.325
All hands on deck.

08:40.486 --> 08:41.486
<i>When I was a kid,</i>

08:41.654 --> 08:44.191
<i>computers made more sense to me
than people.</i>

08:44.324 --> 08:48.170
<i>You said you wanted to set
The Machine free. I already did.</i>

08:48.328 --> 08:52.208
<i>My name is Root.
Please talk to me.</i>

08:55.268 --> 08:59.375
- Can you hear me?
- Absolutely.

08:59.506 --> 09:01.452
Robin, did you hear anything
I just said?

09:03.109 --> 09:04.281
Okay-

09:05.445 --> 09:07.516
Look, some of the patients
have complained

09:07.680 --> 09:09.421
about you talking late into the night.

09:09.582 --> 09:12.343
And since cell phones are strictly
forbidden and you have no roommate,

09:12.385 --> 09:16.765
I can only conclude
that you're talking to yourself.

09:16.923 --> 09:18.527
Is that correct?

09:19.959 --> 09:23.634
- You wouldn't understand.
- Try me.

09:25.732 --> 09:29.646
I have a direct line
to a higher power.

09:29.803 --> 09:32.306
It speaks to me.

09:32.472 --> 09:34.782
I see.

09:37.310 --> 09:41.725
So, um, you're hearing voices.

09:41.881 --> 09:43.883
What are those voices
telling you to do?

09:44.050 --> 09:47.259
It's just the one voice really.

09:47.420 --> 09:52.301
It wants me to stay here,
to work through some issues.

09:52.459 --> 09:57.101
- And what issues would those be?
Methodology.

09:58.498 --> 10:02.310
We're discussing
how I go about things.

10:02.469 --> 10:03.641
You're not alone.

10:03.803 --> 10:08.274
All these news about government
monitoring our digital lives,

10:08.441 --> 10:13.618
recording texts, emails, phone calls.
Well, it's unsettling.

10:13.780 --> 10:17.853
You know, it's easy to feel violated,
even paranoid.

10:20.186 --> 10:23.633
Let me ask you this, do you have
feelings that you're being watched?

10:30.263 --> 10:32.004
Every now and then.

10:36.870 --> 10:40.509
Any idea whether our sailor's
a victim or a perpetrator yet?

10:40.510 --> 10:43.317
No, but he sure knows
how to handle himself in a fight.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.887
What else we got on this guy?

10:44.944 --> 10:48.687
He scored all fives on his evals
last year, highest marks.

10:48.848 --> 10:51.021
Same on his physical readiness test.

10:52.552 --> 10:54.896
The Navy may have bigger plans
for him.

10:55.054 --> 10:58.228
His contract's up in six months.
He'll be free to go.

10:59.726 --> 11:01.728
Can you find out
if he's taken any other tests?

11:01.895 --> 11:04.967
- Academic or PST exams?
- I will.

11:05.131 --> 11:08.203
Although it seems like getting into
a barroom brawl on shore leave

11:08.368 --> 11:11.679
is not very prudent for someone
with further military aspirations.

11:13.373 --> 11:16.081
Jack didn't start that fight
but he's willing to finish it.

11:16.242 --> 11:19.587
I would've done the same thing.
His shore leave buddy was in trouble.

11:21.314 --> 11:23.920
Robert Johnson Phillips,

11:24.083 --> 11:27.496
petty officer third class
and ship storekeeper.

11:27.654 --> 11:30.658
And first class troublemaker.
They're shipmates.

11:30.823 --> 11:32.063
Which means that they'll have

11:32.225 --> 11:34.705
to sign back into the ship together
after midnight.

11:34.861 --> 11:38.604
It might help us to enlist another
asset with military experience

11:38.765 --> 11:39.925
to help track down them down.

11:42.435 --> 11:45.041
Just let me go.
I won't do it again, huh?

11:45.205 --> 11:47.583
Caught this one flashing his junk
in the park again.

11:47.740 --> 11:50.619
All excited about
the randy sailors in town.

11:50.777 --> 11:54.384
Carter, what are you doing here?

11:54.547 --> 11:57.255
Third time I caught this guy
in Hudson River Park

11:57.417 --> 11:59.294
which makes me think
he might know something

11:59.452 --> 12:01.454
about that homicide
you caught there yesterday.

12:01.621 --> 12:03.032
I appreciate you looking out.

12:03.189 --> 12:06.796
Look, I'm still a cop, Fusco.
How's your new partner?

12:07.760 --> 12:09.603
Guy's a box of rocks.

12:09.762 --> 12:10.842
This whole thing's a crock,

12:10.964 --> 12:12.804
everybody knows you got hosed
on that shooting.

12:12.828 --> 12:15.637
What, do they expect you to push
around a squad car the next ten years?

12:15.802 --> 12:18.373
- Till I get my 20.
- You just now clocking out?

12:19.772 --> 12:23.310
- Oh, our mutual friend.
- Looks like your day job just began.

12:25.144 --> 12:26.748
Carter.

12:28.982 --> 12:30.962
Checked every bar
in Hell's Kitchen

12:31.117 --> 12:34.894
every tattoo parlour
on the west side.

12:35.054 --> 12:36.829
Where the hell else
would a swabbie go?

12:36.990 --> 12:40.938
To get some. He's a sailor.
Come here.

12:44.797 --> 12:47.004
- Ma'am.
- Why are we stopping here?

12:47.166 --> 12:50.579
I told you, this area is restricted.
Sailors aren't supposed to be here.

12:50.737 --> 12:53.650
Well, when did the Navy
outlaw pastrami?

12:53.806 --> 12:57.754
See that phone booth?
Just watch.

13:12.525 --> 13:13.868
The mayor know about this place?

13:14.027 --> 13:16.633
If he did,
Vice would have to shut it down.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.333
But then, half the NYPD
would have to find a new place

13:19.499 --> 13:20.500
for bachelor parties.

13:22.335 --> 13:27.546
How are you holding up, Carter?
You looking for a new job?

13:27.707 --> 13:31.211
I'm a cop.
Always will be, John.

13:31.511 --> 13:34.048
<i>Jack, are you believing this place?</i>

13:35.114 --> 13:37.219
Just found our swabbie.

13:37.383 --> 13:39.063
He's not getting away this time.
Excuse me.

13:40.887 --> 13:43.197
Get you a drink, ma'am?

13:44.557 --> 13:46.833
Only if you stop calling me ma'am.

13:53.199 --> 13:54.906
Shot of bourbon.

13:56.002 --> 13:57.310
Looking for company, sailor?

13:57.470 --> 13:59.575
You got the cash,
I got the open window.

13:59.739 --> 14:03.243
Appreciate the opportunity but I was
kind of looking for the real thing.

14:08.247 --> 14:11.922
I got the cash, darling,
and a rapidly closing window?

14:12.085 --> 14:13.996
Easy there, killer.

14:14.153 --> 14:17.430
That ought to cover her and the room.
Try not to get rolled.

14:17.590 --> 14:22.835
Hey, thanks, Jack.
Oh, you should take these too?

14:22.995 --> 14:26.033
Cigars?
- Not just cigars, Cubans.

14:26.199 --> 14:29.373
The admiral needed a few cases
shipped off the boat,

14:29.535 --> 14:31.014
so I taxed him a few.

14:31.170 --> 14:33.275
No big deal.
We'll celebrate tomorrow.

14:33.439 --> 14:35.510
Always skimming something, RJ.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.435
Don't get your hand caught
in the cookie jar.

14:37.459 --> 14:39.019
Meet back in an hour.
Can you do that?

14:39.178 --> 14:42.387
Look at her.
I'll be back in 30.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.292
Mm-mm-mm!

14:54.961 --> 14:57.965
<i>Hey, it's RJ.
You know the drill.</i>

14:58.131 --> 14:59.303
RJ, where the hell are you?

14:59.465 --> 15:03.413
We've got less than an hour to get
our ass back on the ship. Call me.

15:05.571 --> 15:08.950
Jack lost his shore leave buddy.
Can't check back in without him.

15:09.108 --> 15:10.917
Hey, squid.

15:14.147 --> 15:17.321
Remember me?
- Yeah, from the ship.

15:17.483 --> 15:18.621
Is there a problem?

15:18.785 --> 15:21.664
Yeah, you know what the problem is.
You have it, we want it back.

15:21.821 --> 15:23.941
Honestly, I don't know
what you're talking about, man.

15:23.965 --> 15:25.633
Much bigger problem, Finch.

15:25.792 --> 15:28.398
Some devil dog's
got a bone to pick with Jack.

15:28.561 --> 15:30.336
Devil dogs?

15:30.496 --> 15:32.635
Yeah, Spec Ops,
Force Recon Marines.

15:34.267 --> 15:39.012
Team of four, maybe five.
Just sealed off the block.

15:40.239 --> 15:42.685
If I go straight in, Jack'll be dead
before I even get to him.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.980
Don't screw with us.
We screw with you. Empty your pockets.

15:46.078 --> 15:47.838
Look, man,
I don't really have time for this.

15:47.862 --> 15:49.933
I gotta get my shipmate,
and I gotta get...

15:57.924 --> 16:00.632
They're stealing a car.
It's an extraction.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.501
- I gotta get him out.
- Please be careful, Mr. Reese.

16:15.174 --> 16:18.212
Feel that?
That's your rib cracking.

16:18.377 --> 16:22.450
I jam it two inches further,
I'm gonna puncture your lung.

16:22.615 --> 16:23.650
Where is it?

16:23.816 --> 16:25.536
I don't know what you're
talking about, man.

16:27.620 --> 16:30.157
Get him and his buddy to a room.
We'll sort them out.

16:41.467 --> 16:43.811
Hey! What the hell?
Who is that?

16:51.477 --> 16:55.857
<i>Finch, our sailor took fire.
Gonna need some help.</i>

16:56.015 --> 16:58.296
Let's get this bullet out
before the squid wakes up.

17:00.853 --> 17:03.595
Could shoot you or save you.
Frankly, I could go either way.

17:03.756 --> 17:08.704
- Easy, Salazar. We're the good guys.
- Oh, I knew this was a bad idea.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.499
Who are you people?
Where am I?

17:10.663 --> 17:13.609
You have a bullet lodged
in your shoulder, Mr. Salazar.

17:13.766 --> 17:18.339
A gift from a very angry group
of Force Recon devil dogs

17:18.503 --> 17:20.540
whom I can only assume
live up to their name.

17:20.705 --> 17:23.710
Now, Ms. Shaw has medical experience,

17:23.876 --> 17:26.356
so you can
either let her retrieve the bullet

17:26.512 --> 17:30.358
or we can continue to discuss
the matter until you contract sepsis.

17:37.056 --> 17:41.129
- Sure you know what you're doing?
- I've been shot. A lot.

17:41.294 --> 17:44.798
You wanna tell us why a squad
of elite killers is after you?

17:44.964 --> 17:46.443
Don't know.

17:46.599 --> 17:50.274
Guys were in Somalia doing
God knows what, fighting rebels.

17:50.436 --> 17:54.248
Leader had a war trophy
he wanted to bring back, AK-47.

17:54.407 --> 17:57.320
I stashed it in a crate
of spent brass.

17:57.476 --> 18:00.218
So you helped them smuggle
an illegal weapon through US Customs?

18:00.379 --> 18:01.653
It happens all the time.

18:01.814 --> 18:04.727
My buddy RJ unloaded the crate,
said he gave back the rifle.

18:04.884 --> 18:07.797
It doesn't add up. Why would
they try to kill him over a weapon?

18:07.954 --> 18:11.629
It's not the weapon, Ms. Shaw.
It's what was hidden inside it.

18:13.059 --> 18:15.266
Somali pirates attacked
a deep-sea mining vessel

18:15.428 --> 18:17.806
off the coast of Africa.

18:17.964 --> 18:20.774
- Your Marine friends intervened.
- What kind of mining?

18:22.602 --> 18:24.240
Oh...

18:26.405 --> 18:27.782
Speaker.

18:29.008 --> 18:31.955
<i>Hey, bagger, you forgot
it's the buddy system?</i>

18:32.111 --> 18:33.112
<i>We got your buddy.</i>

18:33.279 --> 18:35.316
<i>Sorry, Jack, I screwed up.
Look, I taxed them.</i>

18:35.481 --> 18:37.757
<i>It was just a few.
I didn't think they'd miss them!</i>

18:37.917 --> 18:39.624
Miss what?
What're you talking about?

18:39.785 --> 18:41.264
<i>Check the Cubans.</i>

18:45.591 --> 18:48.504
Uncut stones.
The ship was mining diamonds.

18:48.661 --> 18:51.335
<i>You wanna see
your buddy alive, Jack,</i>

18:51.497 --> 18:55.274
<i>bring the rocks to the Babcock,
Room 212. Come alone.</i>

19:01.674 --> 19:05.679
<i>We really haven't talked about
your family or friends, Robin.</i>

19:05.845 --> 19:10.055
Your uncle, Harold, is it?
Who arranged your admission.

19:10.216 --> 19:12.526
Are you close with him?

19:14.186 --> 19:17.531
That's a complicated question,
Doctor.

19:17.690 --> 19:20.864
I wouldn't wanna be anything less
than totally forthcoming

19:21.027 --> 19:24.474
so maybe we should try
another subject.

19:26.732 --> 19:28.370
Okay.

19:28.534 --> 19:32.641
You say that you don't wanna be
anything less than forthcoming.

19:34.907 --> 19:36.215
And yet, you're lying to me.

19:37.810 --> 19:42.259
On the contrary,
I've been completely honest.

19:45.184 --> 19:48.165
Please, excuse me.

19:51.257 --> 19:54.704
Well, maybe not completely.

19:54.860 --> 19:58.433
I thought I lost this
and it turns out it was stolen.

20:01.500 --> 20:06.848
I'm sorry, Doctor,
but it's important we be in contact.

20:09.108 --> 20:14.581
We're in the middle
of a disagreement.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.556
A disagreement with the voice?

20:16.716 --> 20:18.059
Mm.

20:21.287 --> 20:23.733
I want you to know
that I support you unconditionally.

20:26.592 --> 20:28.765
Now, I know you believe
you need a phone

20:28.928 --> 20:31.636
and I am here to tell you
that you don't.

20:31.797 --> 20:33.401
I believe that by separating you
from it

20:33.566 --> 20:35.739
and from all other
forms of technology,

20:35.901 --> 20:37.539
it's really the best course
of action.

20:37.703 --> 20:41.549
So it's time to unplug.
Some assistance, please.

20:41.707 --> 20:45.746
Please. Don't do this.

20:45.911 --> 20:48.983
It's not good for us to be separated.

20:49.148 --> 20:52.095
I hope you realize
I'm trying to help you.

20:53.319 --> 20:55.595
Escort our patient
to solitary confinement.

20:55.755 --> 20:59.760
No contact with anything electronic.
You'll thank me someday.

20:59.925 --> 21:06.433
For a psychiatrist, you're really
a terrible judge of character.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.980
<i>- What are we doing here?</i>
- Recon.

21:16.142 --> 21:20.147
- The exchange goes down there in ten.
- That's it.

21:20.312 --> 21:24.852
Spec Ops will have a sniper.
That's where I'd be.

21:25.017 --> 21:26.963
You got any cash?

21:34.493 --> 21:37.497
- Don't know how I wound up here.
- I do.

21:37.663 --> 21:41.770
Same reason you got into a fight
with those jarheads.

21:43.536 --> 21:45.709
You stand up for people
you care about.

21:45.871 --> 21:49.318
- Lot of good it's done me, huh?
- We'll see.

21:49.475 --> 21:54.982
- You can't be something you're not.
- Yeah? And who am I?

21:56.515 --> 22:01.294
You're a good guy, Jack.
You just haven't figured it out yet.

22:03.856 --> 22:05.494
<i>Gracias.</i>

22:10.529 --> 22:12.089
What, you need help finding
a trash can?

22:13.399 --> 22:15.639
You're a smart guy,
you'll figure out what to do with it.

22:16.569 --> 22:18.674
Give me three minutes.

22:43.495 --> 22:47.341
Old leatherneck has a nice weapon.
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

22:47.499 --> 22:51.606
Just remember.
No shots to centre mass.

22:51.770 --> 22:54.876
But it's a shame to waste a rifle
like this on kneecaps.

22:57.910 --> 23:02.052
No sentry. Somethings up.
You got eyes on the room?

23:02.214 --> 23:04.125
- Who's there?
- Looks vacated.

23:04.283 --> 23:06.957
For good reason,
poor guy's rigged up to go boom.

23:11.123 --> 23:14.866
Don't.
Can't risk setting him off.

23:18.030 --> 23:20.874
Your friend's sitting on an IED.

23:29.708 --> 23:32.052
Look, I'm sorry I got you into this,
Jack.

23:33.812 --> 23:38.056
But if you can get me out of here,
I swear I'll cop to everything.

23:38.217 --> 23:42.222
Take it easy.
You're gonna be okay.

23:43.422 --> 23:47.962
<i>I wouldn't say that.
We told you to come alone.</i>

23:48.127 --> 23:51.904
<i>You brought the suit,
so now he's a guest at our party.</i>

23:52.064 --> 23:55.944
<i>He tries to leave,
we hit a button, RJ explodes.</i>

23:56.101 --> 24:00.607
<i>You try to move RJ, he explodes.
You understand me, squid?</i>

24:00.773 --> 24:03.413
- I get the gist.
<i>- Destroy your phone.</i>

24:10.916 --> 24:12.020
<i>There's a cab on the curb</i>

24:12.184 --> 24:14.824
<i>that'll take you to the next location,
alone.</i>

24:18.524 --> 24:22.666
You walk out that door, Jack,
you won't come back.

24:26.799 --> 24:30.337
RJ's my friend.
You said it yourself.

24:32.137 --> 24:34.708
I can't be something I'm not.

24:55.060 --> 24:57.370
Harold, the exchange
went pear-shaped.

24:57.529 --> 25:00.066
Yes, I heard.
Can you follow Mr. Salazar?

25:00.232 --> 25:01.575
<i>Not an option. He's long gone.</i>

25:01.734 --> 25:04.840
Never even got to take this baby out
for a test drive.

25:05.004 --> 25:07.204
Well, the Marines will have
to fence the uncut diamonds.

25:07.206 --> 25:09.413
Locate the fence,
odds are we can locate Jack.

25:09.575 --> 25:11.816
- Where to now?
- I have another resource on that.

25:11.977 --> 25:14.548
Well, suit yourself.

25:17.649 --> 25:19.720
- Yeah?
- How's your contacts in Robbery?

25:19.885 --> 25:25.062
Not yet.
Don't worry, I got a source.

25:36.268 --> 25:38.339
What happened to time off
for good behavior?

25:38.504 --> 25:40.609
That assumes you've been good.

25:40.773 --> 25:43.344
We had a deal,
you keep a low profile.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.720
Why else would I be enjoying
my barolo in a basement?

25:46.879 --> 25:50.850
Your man's been seen
in Crown Heights, Russian territory.

25:52.084 --> 25:53.563
It's all Russian territory now.

25:55.788 --> 25:57.358
Give us a moment, alone.

26:04.797 --> 26:08.768
Thank you for helping my boss.

26:11.570 --> 26:14.483
What do you know,
you've made a friend.

26:14.640 --> 26:16.085
Speaking of, I can't help but notice

26:16.241 --> 26:18.812
that I haven't received
a visit from Harold or John.

26:18.977 --> 26:21.389
Haven't told them yet, have you?

26:21.547 --> 26:23.254
Afraid they'd object
to our little deal?

26:23.415 --> 26:26.328
There's no deal, okay?
I had no choice.

26:26.485 --> 26:27.793
If I'd put you back in prison,

26:27.953 --> 26:32.163
someone, cops or the Russians,
would've killed you sooner or later.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.903
I need a name.

26:37.062 --> 26:40.805
Someone with the means to fence
large quantities of uncut diamonds.

26:42.801 --> 26:44.906
Well, if someone is interested
in such a transaction,

26:45.070 --> 26:47.243
they'd have to connect
with a mobile fence,

26:47.406 --> 26:52.822
and I can think of an unscrupulous
Russian by the name of Maksim,

26:52.978 --> 26:56.084
presently operating out of
a pawn shop in the Flatiron District.

26:59.618 --> 27:03.464
Careful, this is dangerous business,
Detective.

27:05.357 --> 27:07.132
It's "Officer" now.

27:07.292 --> 27:09.966
Such a shame.
I hate seeing talent go to waste.

27:10.129 --> 27:13.838
I could take care of HR
and the Russians. Permanently.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.676
Enjoy the rest of your barolo.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.826
How's it going, Finch?

27:29.982 --> 27:32.519
I've intercepted the signal
at the cell tower.

27:32.684 --> 27:36.359
I'm creating a loop to send back
down the line to the team leader.

27:36.522 --> 27:40.163
It'll appear to him
as if you never left the room.

27:40.359 --> 27:42.168
All done.
You can leave, Mr. Reese.

27:42.294 --> 27:44.865
I suggest you do so in a hurry.
I've sent reinforcements.

27:45.030 --> 27:47.408
Who?

27:51.737 --> 27:53.045
Oh...

27:53.238 --> 27:55.184
Never a dull moment with you guys.

27:56.842 --> 27:59.254
Here, Carter came through.

27:59.411 --> 28:01.550
Address for the fence
in the Flatiron District.

28:03.549 --> 28:06.826
You ready? These Ruskies are ruthless
and packing serious heat.

28:06.985 --> 28:08.589
It sounds like a job for Shaw.

28:08.754 --> 28:12.725
Besides, someone needs
to defuse that bomb. Hop to, Lionel.

28:12.891 --> 28:14.811
What? Nobody said anything
about defusing a bomb.

28:14.860 --> 28:17.101
Be careful, it's got a failsafe.

28:17.262 --> 28:20.573
If you try to cut the power source,
it'll blow, so dig out the igniter.

28:20.732 --> 28:22.370
The what?

28:49.094 --> 28:51.370
I got your rocks.
You afraid to come out and play?

28:51.530 --> 28:55.808
You still think you're in charge of
this little operation, swab-jockey?

28:55.968 --> 28:57.777
Don't know.
I got your whole stash.

28:57.936 --> 29:01.645
Yeah, well, I got a little
insurance policy. Your buddy RJ.

29:01.807 --> 29:05.983
- There's a pawn shop at 23rd and Lex.
- What about it?

29:06.144 --> 29:08.784
You're gonna play
"let's make a deal" with our fence.

29:08.947 --> 29:12.326
You bring him the diamonds
and you bring us the cash.

29:12.484 --> 29:15.590
He tries to pull a fast one,
you end up in a body bag.

29:15.754 --> 29:18.928
Time's ticking, Petty Officer.

29:35.974 --> 29:37.681
How long
before the devil dog realizes

29:37.843 --> 29:39.083
your friend switched the video?

29:40.112 --> 29:42.820
Long enough.
Let's hope.

29:42.981 --> 29:45.188
You're in the Navy.
Know anything about igniters?

29:45.350 --> 29:48.354
Man, I'm a glorified shopkeeper.
I inventory supplies.

29:48.520 --> 29:50.295
Don't worry, I'm a cop.

29:51.757 --> 29:53.759
- Bomb Squad?
- Homicide.

30:07.673 --> 30:09.949
You have something for me?

30:23.355 --> 30:25.631
You're not the one
who I talked to on the phone.

30:27.626 --> 30:31.631
- You a tourist?
- Guess you could say that.

30:33.332 --> 30:37.075
Then you get tourist rate.
Thirty cents on the dollar.

30:37.235 --> 30:40.546
Wait, you don't understand
who you're screwing with.

30:40.706 --> 30:44.848
Who? A man with no gun,
no backup?

30:45.010 --> 30:47.854
Maybe we keep our money
and your diamonds.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.889
We don't renegotiate.

30:58.990 --> 31:03.905
Another fine Navy day.
You must be Maksim.

31:05.897 --> 31:09.435
You said 50 cents on the dollar.

31:09.601 --> 31:11.877
That was before I saw
the merchandise.

31:12.037 --> 31:14.779
You failed to mention
it's from Africa.

31:14.940 --> 31:18.012
Unfortunately for you,
I have read all about the pirates

31:18.176 --> 31:20.918
and the Marine heroes
who took them down.

31:23.281 --> 31:24.726
Took big risk coming meeting you.

31:28.954 --> 31:31.230
Risk goes up, price goes down.

31:34.960 --> 31:36.371
I give you 1.2.

31:40.532 --> 31:42.808
How much for me to not put
a bullet in your brain?

31:43.635 --> 31:45.376
Put your weapon down!

32:02.754 --> 32:06.133
I'm sorry, are you guys closed?

32:15.167 --> 32:17.807
It's a bit tense in here.

32:21.506 --> 32:24.919
- Can I make a suggestion?
- What the hell are you doing here?

32:26.778 --> 32:30.021
- Who is this? Cop?
Concerned third party.

32:30.182 --> 32:31.855
I've got no stake in this

32:32.017 --> 32:33.519
except for helping my friend Jack
out of here

32:33.685 --> 32:36.045
with the same number of holes
he had in him when he came in.

32:36.087 --> 32:37.259
What's your point?

32:38.990 --> 32:40.594
Forty cents on the dollar?

32:42.027 --> 32:45.133
Hey, Reese, no offense.

32:45.297 --> 32:46.935
If the vigilante thing
doesn't work out,

32:47.098 --> 32:50.443
I'm not really seeing a future
for you in conflict resolution.

32:53.772 --> 32:57.151
The suit here just got
your buddy killed.

33:03.215 --> 33:06.287
Detective, get out, now!
- There's no time.

33:09.888 --> 33:11.868
Goodbye.

33:20.565 --> 33:23.239
Told you I got it covered.

33:26.238 --> 33:28.149
I suggest you keep your mouth shut.

33:30.575 --> 33:33.181
And you give us what you agreed to
or we kill you.

33:33.411 --> 33:37.223
You think you're pretty tough, no?
US Devil Dogs.

33:37.315 --> 33:42.162
Run around, kill Iraqis,
kill Afghans, Somalis.

33:42.320 --> 33:46.894
You know who you don't kill?
Russians.

33:47.659 --> 33:49.661
<i>Reese, why are the Russians
backing up?</i>

33:49.828 --> 33:52.502
<i>You know what? I enlisted in
the Marines to kill Russians.</i>

33:52.664 --> 33:55.008
<i>Looks like Fm gonna get
my chance.</i>

33:55.166 --> 33:56.167
Wait a minute.

33:58.904 --> 34:01.185
Looks like the Russians brought
some friends to the party.

34:01.273 --> 34:03.344
Multiple shooters above you, Reese.

34:05.710 --> 34:06.780
Get clear, now.

34:18.623 --> 34:21.297
You gonna ambush somebody,
use a muzzle suppressor.

34:23.027 --> 34:24.234
Losers.

34:28.300 --> 34:30.712
Shaw, a little help here?

34:30.869 --> 34:32.149
I would have taken the head shot

34:32.172 --> 34:34.551
but Finch gets annoyed
when I kill people.

34:38.208 --> 34:42.282
In the arm, through a brick wall,
in the dark. You're welcome.

34:46.618 --> 34:47.824
Oops.

34:52.489 --> 34:55.801
- You wanna get out of here?
- Yeah, I think so.

35:13.345 --> 35:14.905
Time to get your friend back
to the ship

35:15.067 --> 35:16.375
before he turns into a pumpkin.

35:16.535 --> 35:19.492
You're pretty handy with that thing.

35:19.651 --> 35:22.655
I'm hungry.
You're buying me a steak.

36:19.544 --> 36:21.581
Heard about the shoot-out
in the Flatiron District.

36:21.746 --> 36:24.317
<i>Lot of damage, John.
You get your man out alive?</i>

36:24.482 --> 36:25.586
With a little help.

36:25.750 --> 36:30.096
Listen, Carter...
You doing okay?

36:31.256 --> 36:33.395
It's been a while
since we sat down and talked.

36:33.558 --> 36:37.665
I'm fine, John, you know,
just getting on with my job.

36:37.829 --> 36:42.869
You know if you ever needed help,
you just need to call me, right?

36:43.034 --> 36:47.107
I know. Thanks.

37:25.643 --> 37:30.217
Celebrating or commiserating?
- Both.

37:30.381 --> 37:32.554
RJ took the rap for everything.

37:32.951 --> 37:34.471
Captain gave me
a desk-drawer reprimand

37:34.552 --> 37:37.158
and two days swabbing the deck.

37:37.322 --> 37:40.098
I got an hour left of liberty
before I gotta get back on the ship.

37:41.292 --> 37:43.169
So, what's the plan now?

37:43.328 --> 37:46.468
Captain thinks I could make it
through BUD/S, become a SEAL,

37:46.631 --> 37:48.269
but after what happened,

37:48.433 --> 37:50.470
I'm not too sure about
the military anymore.

37:53.805 --> 37:57.150
Thought maybe there was a chance
for a normal life after my tour's up.

37:57.308 --> 38:00.187
Like those two.

38:00.345 --> 38:02.518
Well, the military's full of good
and bad

38:02.680 --> 38:04.284
just like the rest of the world.

38:04.449 --> 38:07.828
A guy like you could do
a lot of good.

38:07.986 --> 38:09.624
I was forced to join in
the first place.

38:09.788 --> 38:12.668
What, you think you're the first kid
to have to stand in front of a judge

38:12.824 --> 38:15.202
and pick door number two?

38:18.096 --> 38:23.671
Turns out, I was good at it.
Maybe even made for it.

38:23.835 --> 38:25.314
And so are you.

38:25.470 --> 38:27.313
With your talent,
it probably won't be long

38:27.472 --> 38:29.349
before the CIA comes knocking.

38:29.507 --> 38:34.388
- So what should I do?
- That's up to you.

38:34.546 --> 38:39.359
But in a few years, when the guys
from Langley show up...

38:41.052 --> 38:42.497
...say no.

38:53.832 --> 38:56.312
I'd like to buy the happy couple
two glasses of champagne.

39:16.187 --> 39:19.361
Thanks.
For everything.

39:27.999 --> 39:30.172
Nicely done, Mr. Reese.

39:30.335 --> 39:34.750
I realize now I never did hear
how you came to enlist in the Army.

39:34.906 --> 39:39.412
Because I never told you, Finch.
I'm a very private person.

39:42.247 --> 39:46.525
Well, one more thing
set right in the universe.

39:46.684 --> 39:50.131
- You should look happier, Harold.
- I am.

39:50.288 --> 39:55.738
It's just I have a feeling things
are about to get more complicated.

40:01.432 --> 40:04.879
Then you might as well enjoy
your first boilermaker.

40:18.316 --> 40:21.559
<i>I thought it would be good for us
to resume our dialogue.</i>

40:21.719 --> 40:24.131
I know you'd rather be talking
to the voice

40:24.289 --> 40:26.394
but you're gonna have to settle
for talking to me.

40:26.557 --> 40:28.298
What do you wanna talk about?

40:28.459 --> 40:30.666
I'd like to talk about
something real, Robin.

40:30.828 --> 40:31.932
I know you're very smart.

40:32.096 --> 40:34.508
I'd love to know
what you're really thinking.

40:34.666 --> 40:36.737
So why don't we start
with the truth?

40:38.603 --> 40:39.638
The truth?

40:44.609 --> 40:47.954
The truth is a vast thing.

40:48.112 --> 40:52.527
I see that now,
just how much truth there is.

40:52.684 --> 40:54.095
Where would we even begin?

40:58.957 --> 41:03.463
The truth is you are not very smart.

41:04.862 --> 41:08.639
In fact, you're only the 43rd
smartest person in this building.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.871
Forty-third?

41:11.869 --> 41:16.045
Okay, did your voice tell you that?

41:17.308 --> 41:18.548
That's based on what?

41:18.710 --> 41:21.213
Every standardized test
you ever took averaged together,

41:21.379 --> 41:24.360
not including your medical boards
which you cheated on.

41:24.515 --> 41:27.894
The truth is you smoke an average
of nine cigarettes a week

41:28.052 --> 41:30.362
in the parking lot
when you think no one's looking.

41:30.521 --> 41:34.799
The truth is that you visit a massage
parlour once or twice a month,

41:34.959 --> 41:37.371
that you pay for it with crisp
100 dollar bills

41:37.528 --> 41:40.509
that you get out of the cash machine
at the 7-Eleven across the street.

41:42.066 --> 41:44.672
The truth is that you fantasize
on online forums

41:44.836 --> 41:47.749
about having sex
with some of your patients,

41:47.905 --> 41:52.581
though not me, yet.
I guess I'm not your type.

41:56.748 --> 42:00.093
The truth is, God is 11 years old,

42:00.251 --> 42:04.859
that she was born on New Year's Day,
2002, in Manhattan.

42:05.023 --> 42:09.563
The truth is that she's chosen me...

42:11.329 --> 42:12.899
...and I don't know why yet,

42:13.064 --> 42:15.772
but for the first time in my life...

42:17.668 --> 42:20.911
...I'm a little scared about
what's gonna happen.

42:23.608 --> 42:26.714
The truth is, I'm stuck here for now,

42:26.878 --> 42:31.623
and the only dialogue you need to be
worried about is between me and her,

42:31.783 --> 42:35.253
which is why you might wanna
give me my phone back.

42:35.420 --> 42:38.299
Because I'm having an argument.

42:40.892 --> 42:44.135
Would you like to know the truth,
Doctor?

42:46.064 --> 42:47.771
About what we're arguing over?

42:54.605 --> 42:58.314
Whether or not I'm gonna kill you.

43:02.980 --> 43:05.426
