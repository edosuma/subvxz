Buttercup rocks!

01:01.923 --> 01:03.787
So,
what do you think?

01:03.822 --> 01:05.927
Pretty fierce super cut,
right?

01:05.962 --> 01:07.205
My review?

01:07.239 --> 01:10.587
I think it was aggressive
yet inspiring.

01:10.622 --> 01:14.108
And I think that was
the school's last kickball.

01:14.143 --> 01:17.077
We're down to playing
with an old plastic jug.

01:17.111 --> 01:18.595
You've been neglecting
your chores.

01:18.630 --> 01:20.735
You promised to
make dinner all week,

01:20.770 --> 01:23.083
but you haven't
done it once.

01:23.117 --> 01:24.084
Buttercup!

01:24.118 --> 01:25.292
All right.

01:25.326 --> 01:27.466
My video got me
another follower.

01:27.501 --> 01:30.193
Hey, hey, hey.

01:31.781 --> 01:33.334
The next day.

01:33.369 --> 01:35.509
Hyah!

01:35.543 --> 01:36.958
Hya--

01:36.993 --> 01:38.857
Hyaaah.

01:38.891 --> 01:40.928
What the...?
Come on.

01:40.962 --> 01:42.930
There we go.

01:42.964 --> 01:45.760
Uh, yeah!

01:45.795 --> 01:47.866
Whoa!

01:47.900 --> 01:49.454
Ugh.

01:49.488 --> 01:50.696
Yeah.

01:52.802 --> 01:54.493
Yeah! Lunch!

01:59.533 --> 02:02.052
Man, something is
up with me today.

02:02.087 --> 02:04.676
Relax. You're fine.

02:04.710 --> 02:06.264
Ugh. See?

02:06.298 --> 02:08.127
It's like
I lost my mojo.

02:08.162 --> 02:09.783
What?
He's right over there.

02:10.889 --> 02:13.616
Mojo will go down
at his own pace.

02:13.650 --> 02:15.721
You know what I mean.

02:15.756 --> 02:18.276
I just feel off.

02:18.310 --> 02:20.795
Hey, guys!
Want to go to Penguin Pete's?

02:20.830 --> 02:24.627
I've got "scoupons."
It's two-for-one scoop day.

02:24.661 --> 02:27.077
Ooh, I'm sure that will
make you feel better.

02:27.112 --> 02:30.011
Nah,
I'm not feeling so hot.

02:30.046 --> 02:31.910
I'm just gonna
head home.

02:31.944 --> 02:33.049
Okay.

02:33.083 --> 02:34.982
Call us
if you change your mind.

02:35.016 --> 02:36.742
Ugh.

02:36.777 --> 02:38.744
Incoming!

02:38.779 --> 02:39.987
Ugh.

02:40.021 --> 02:41.333
Sorry, Buttercup.

02:41.368 --> 02:43.715
It's just that we're down
to playing kickball

02:43.749 --> 02:45.061
with a milk jug.

02:45.095 --> 02:48.375
Ah, my head.

02:48.409 --> 02:50.066
What?

02:50.100 --> 02:51.481
Nothing.

02:53.863 --> 02:55.727
Buttercup rocks!

02:55.761 --> 02:57.556
Buttercup rocks!

02:57.591 --> 02:59.834
Buttercup rocks!

02:59.869 --> 03:01.905
Buttercup --

03:01.940 --> 03:05.530
Buttercup, whew, rocks.

03:06.738 --> 03:09.396
Whew.

03:09.430 --> 03:12.502
Buttercup
rocks.

03:12.537 --> 03:13.400
Whew.

03:13.434 --> 03:17.335
Ugh, that took forever.

03:17.369 --> 03:20.372
I am sweating like crazy.

03:22.132 --> 03:24.342
Aah! I'm melting!

03:24.376 --> 03:26.723
- Buttercup!

03:26.758 --> 03:28.518
Uh, s-someone's in here!

03:28.553 --> 03:30.417
I think
she's pooping.

03:30.451 --> 03:33.143
How did you beat us home
from Penguin Pete's?

03:33.178 --> 03:34.766
What are you talking about?

03:34.800 --> 03:38.390
Remember? You changed your mind
and came to get ice cream?

03:38.425 --> 03:40.530
Yeah.
You bench pressed a table

03:40.565 --> 03:43.292
and chugged
two root beer floats.

03:43.326 --> 03:45.742
You were just starting
the third one when we left.

03:45.777 --> 03:49.712
That is stuff I do,
but that's impossible.

03:49.746 --> 03:50.989
Come on, Buttercup.

03:51.023 --> 03:53.163
No, uh,
I'm gonna be awhile.

03:53.198 --> 03:55.062
I got to get down
to Penguin Pete's

03:55.096 --> 03:56.305
and figure out
what's going on.

03:56.339 --> 03:57.789
Ah!

03:57.823 --> 03:59.135
Buttercup!

04:05.417 --> 04:06.384
-Whoo!
-Yeah!

04:06.418 --> 04:07.937
Buttercup! Buttercup!

04:07.971 --> 04:10.905
What the...?

04:10.940 --> 04:15.255
Yeah!
See you tomorrow!

04:15.289 --> 04:17.601
Well,
look who showed up,

04:17.636 --> 04:20.570
not that it will
do you any good.

04:20.605 --> 04:22.641
Who are you?

04:22.676 --> 04:25.265
And why
do you look like me?

04:25.299 --> 04:26.576
Because I am you now.

04:26.611 --> 04:30.166
And you are me,
Butterfingers.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.168
I'll show you
butterfingers.

04:32.202 --> 04:33.342
Ha!

04:33.376 --> 04:34.653
Huh?

04:34.688 --> 04:38.933
Wow, you really showed me,
Butterfingers.

04:38.968 --> 04:41.419
Ah!
What did you do to me?

04:41.453 --> 04:43.524
I took your powers.

04:43.559 --> 04:44.422
But how?

04:44.456 --> 04:47.321
I'm glad you asked.

04:47.356 --> 04:51.325
You see, I always wanted
to be a superhero.

04:51.360 --> 04:57.055
It looked so cool
fighting robots and monsters.

04:57.089 --> 04:59.644
Everybody
loves superheroes.

04:59.678 --> 05:01.611
But I was just a regular kid.

05:01.646 --> 05:05.822
Until one day, I got a job at
the County Science Fair of Food

05:05.857 --> 05:08.031
working
the fried-butter booth.

05:08.066 --> 05:12.829
There was an accident with
the nuclear-fusion deep fryer.

05:17.765 --> 05:20.458
My DNA must have fused
with the butter.

05:20.492 --> 05:22.874
I finally got superpowers.

05:22.908 --> 05:26.843
But it turns out
they weren't all that super.

05:26.878 --> 05:30.157
All I could do was melt.

05:30.191 --> 05:31.538
Dogs chased me.

05:31.572 --> 05:34.161
People cowered at me
then chased me.

05:34.195 --> 05:35.887
I couldn't even drive.

05:35.921 --> 05:39.200
Hey, are you even
old enough to drive?

05:39.235 --> 05:40.926
Shh, my story!

05:40.961 --> 05:45.655
The point is everything was bad,
but the worst of all --

05:45.690 --> 05:48.693
I couldn't fight
robots and monsters.

05:48.727 --> 05:51.903
I was the lamest
superhero ever.

05:51.937 --> 05:55.596
That's when I saw
your videos online.

05:55.631 --> 05:58.254
I'm Buttercup,
and I'm a superhero.

05:58.288 --> 06:01.568
I fight robots.
I fight monsters.

06:01.602 --> 06:03.846
It's great to be me.

06:03.880 --> 06:08.851
So I decided to take your advice
and use my butter-fusion powers

06:08.885 --> 06:12.095
for the one thing
they were good for --

06:12.130 --> 06:14.132
becoming you.

06:14.166 --> 06:18.757
Now that I'm a real superhero,
I'm never going back.

06:18.792 --> 06:20.863
You can't just
steal my body.

06:20.897 --> 06:22.278
I won't let you.

06:22.312 --> 06:25.143
Oh, really?

06:25.177 --> 06:29.285
Ah!
I'm melting!

06:29.319 --> 06:31.874
Aaaaaaaaah!

06:31.908 --> 06:34.428
"Butter" luck next time.

06:36.568 --> 06:38.881
Time to be a superhero.

06:38.915 --> 06:42.229
Oh, man. I'm gonna
punch so many robots.

06:43.679 --> 06:44.956

Pretty sweet, right?

06:55.829 --> 06:58.556
I fought a monster
and a robot.

06:58.590 --> 07:01.938
Oh, man.
Being a superhero is awesome!

07:01.973 --> 07:05.666
Yes. We saw that
because we were there.

07:05.701 --> 07:08.082
Anyway, you have chores
and homework to finish.

07:08.117 --> 07:10.913
And you were supposed
to make dinner all week,

07:10.947 --> 07:12.466
and you haven't.

07:12.501 --> 07:14.744
Now make dinner!

07:14.779 --> 07:18.023
Geez. Fine.
I'll make dinner.

07:19.404 --> 07:22.476
Should we order a pizza
just in case?

07:22.511 --> 07:24.305
No,
let's give her a chance.

07:24.340 --> 07:25.686
Dinner, psh.

07:25.721 --> 07:29.828
Superheroes don't make dinner
or do chores.

07:29.863 --> 07:32.969
I want to fight monsters
and robots.

07:33.004 --> 07:36.179
Ugh. They can't
tell me what to do.

07:36.214 --> 07:39.597
I've been waiting my whole life
to be a superhero.

07:39.631 --> 07:42.600
They're not gonna
ruin this for me.

07:42.634 --> 07:43.946
No.

07:43.980 --> 07:47.812
I won't let them!

07:49.158 --> 07:52.195
I smell butter.

07:52.230 --> 07:55.336
Hello, Butterfingers.

07:55.371 --> 07:57.338
You. But how?

07:57.373 --> 07:59.202
I melted you
down the drain.

07:59.237 --> 08:00.618
You did,

08:00.652 --> 08:04.794
but all drains lead
to the ocean, Butterfingers.

08:04.829 --> 08:06.624
Yeah, exactly.

08:06.658 --> 08:09.799
So I went in
the opposite direction.

08:09.834 --> 08:12.181
Well, then,
I'll just have to send you

08:12.215 --> 08:14.563
right back down the drain.

08:17.600 --> 08:20.327
Whoa, slick move.

08:20.361 --> 08:22.191
You haven't
seen anything yet.

08:27.714 --> 08:31.234
Mmm, sounds like Buttercup's
making something good in there.

08:31.269 --> 08:34.272
So hungry.

08:38.690 --> 08:41.417
What?
Did you get new superpowers?

08:41.451 --> 08:44.385
No. I just figured out
how to use yours.

08:48.389 --> 08:50.564
Ugh.
How are you beating me?

08:50.599 --> 08:53.015
I can fly!

08:54.154 --> 08:56.846
So can airplanes,
but I can beat them up.

08:56.881 --> 09:00.574
When it comes to superpowers,
it doesn't matter what they are.

09:00.609 --> 09:02.887
It's about what
you do with them.

09:05.993 --> 09:08.686
We should make Buttercup
do the dishes too.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.032
Ohhh.

09:13.414 --> 09:15.693
What's wrong?
Getting tired?

09:15.727 --> 09:19.075
I'm just
buttering you up!

09:19.110 --> 09:21.284
Ugh.

09:21.319 --> 09:24.425
You had
all that potential.

09:24.460 --> 09:27.325
Huh? Whoa! Ugh!

09:27.359 --> 09:28.947
But you slipped up.

09:29.845 --> 09:32.882
You're right.
I'm sorry.

09:32.917 --> 09:39.440
Now I realize I've got to
embrace my powers and be myself.

09:39.475 --> 09:41.615
I'll give you
your powers back.

09:41.650 --> 09:43.065
Whoa, really?

09:43.099 --> 09:44.169
No!

09:44.204 --> 09:45.723
I love being you,

09:45.757 --> 09:48.415
and I'm not
giving that up now.

09:48.449 --> 09:50.072
Aaah!

09:50.106 --> 09:51.418
Ugh.

09:51.452 --> 09:55.284
Time to mop you up
for good.

09:55.318 --> 09:56.526
Hyah!

09:56.561 --> 09:58.011
Wait!
Where'd she go?

09:58.045 --> 10:01.808
Right here,
Butterfingers.

10:01.842 --> 10:03.154
Huh?

10:06.502 --> 10:09.539
I -- I did it!

10:09.574 --> 10:11.472
I'm back.

10:11.507 --> 10:14.510
Life was hard as
a stick of butter,

10:14.544 --> 10:16.685
being melty all the time,

10:16.719 --> 10:19.204
and then I realized

10:19.239 --> 10:22.656
it's not my powers
that make me a superhero.

10:22.691 --> 10:25.555
It's me, Buttercup!

10:25.590 --> 10:27.454
I'm great.

10:27.488 --> 10:29.836
So I embraced my new body,

10:29.870 --> 10:34.288
and I fought hard,
but now I'm back, sisters,

10:34.323 --> 10:38.845
and I'm going to make everything
right from here on out.

10:38.879 --> 10:40.985
Thanks for holding on
to the hope

10:41.019 --> 10:45.506
that I would
one day return.

10:46.369 --> 10:50.132
Buttercup, is this just another
excuse to not make dinner?

10:50.166 --> 10:51.305
What?

10:51.340 --> 10:54.861
Wait, did you guys not even
notice I was gone?

10:54.895 --> 10:56.897
Come on, Bubbles.

10:56.932 --> 10:58.830
Let's go order that pizza.

10:58.865 --> 11:00.073
Ohhhh.
