WEBVTT

00:02.436 --> 00:04.138
* Whoo *

00:04.205 --> 00:06.907
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh *

00:06.974 --> 00:08.509
* Oh, oh, oh! *

00:15.516 --> 00:18.486
Grandpa, did you bring me
any more candy?

00:18.552 --> 00:20.488
Mom...

00:21.622 --> 00:23.857
Oh, God.

00:23.924 --> 00:26.127
Burt.

00:26.194 --> 00:28.529
Maw Maw got into the candy.

00:28.596 --> 00:32.100
Hang on, I'm in the middle
of something.

00:33.101 --> 00:36.036
Mommy, are we going
trick-or-treating?

00:36.104 --> 00:37.438
Maybe.

00:37.505 --> 00:38.839
Ooh.
But first go out
on the porch.

00:38.906 --> 00:43.144
It's your turn to look out
for Japanese planes.

00:46.314 --> 00:48.516
Sorry,
I was chasing down a fly.

00:48.582 --> 00:49.550
I got it.

00:50.751 --> 00:51.685
(fly buzzing)

00:51.752 --> 00:54.422
You were supposed
to be watching Maw Maw.

00:54.488 --> 00:57.091
You know when she eats too much
sugar, she gets all worked up

00:57.158 --> 00:59.127
and thinks
she's nine years old again.

00:59.193 --> 01:00.128
I like nine-year-old Maw Maw.

01:00.194 --> 01:02.096
We play jacks.

01:02.163 --> 01:03.797
Hey, Jimmy,
come here.

01:03.864 --> 01:05.433
Look what I got.

01:05.499 --> 01:06.434
(chuckles)

01:06.500 --> 01:08.402
Hmm? Let's scare Hope
with it.

01:08.469 --> 01:10.638
What? Why would we
do that?

01:10.704 --> 01:11.939
BURT:
It's her first Halloween?

01:12.005 --> 01:13.741
She's seven
months old.

01:13.807 --> 01:15.743
She gets scared when
somebody sneezes.

01:15.809 --> 01:17.611
I'm not gonna try and scare
her with a little skull.

01:17.678 --> 01:19.680
Come on, let me scare her
just a little bit.

01:19.747 --> 01:22.183
No, geez, you're worse than
that man with the scary mask

01:22.250 --> 01:24.418
who lives around
the block.

01:26.354 --> 01:29.557
I wonder if he's going
to be out this year.

01:30.724 --> 01:32.460
I hate Halloween.

01:32.526 --> 01:33.994
It started when I was three,

01:34.061 --> 01:36.930
and I had a really great
costume as MC Lil J.

01:36.997 --> 01:38.332
Then my Halloween was ruined

01:38.399 --> 01:41.235
by some jerk that lives
in our neighborhood.

01:41.302 --> 01:47.875
(screaming)

01:47.941 --> 01:50.278
Aw.
And I ended up spending
most of the night

01:50.344 --> 01:52.880
clutching onto my father,
terrified.

01:52.946 --> 01:57.318
Even as I got bigger, that guy
would still freak me out.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.593
(can clatters)

02:19.873 --> 02:22.443
(screaming on television)

02:22.510 --> 02:25.279
You taking Hope
trick-or-treating tonight?

02:25.346 --> 02:26.447
(stammering)

02:26.514 --> 02:28.216
Uh, no, I think
Hope's a little young

02:28.282 --> 02:29.550
to be trick-or-treating and

02:29.617 --> 02:32.019
yeah, I'm not really
a big Halloween guy.

02:32.085 --> 02:33.387
Burt, you got
to tell him.

02:33.454 --> 02:35.789
Shh, dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah...

02:35.856 --> 02:38.025
It's about the scary man
in the mask.

02:38.091 --> 02:39.627
What about the scary man
in the mask?

02:39.693 --> 02:40.961
Did you find out
who it is?

02:41.028 --> 02:42.263
Because we can
call the cops.

02:42.330 --> 02:44.097
Burt...
Fine.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.767
There is no man
in the mask.

02:49.270 --> 02:51.205
Is it a ghost?

02:51.272 --> 02:52.806
No, it's not a ghost.

03:12.059 --> 03:14.462
So adorable.

03:16.063 --> 03:17.965
JIMMY:
What the hell

03:18.031 --> 03:19.066
is wrong with you?

03:19.132 --> 03:20.634
Why would you torture me
like that?

03:20.701 --> 03:22.069
The hugs.

03:22.135 --> 03:24.672
I did it for the hugs!
What?

03:24.738 --> 03:26.640
When you hugged your mother,
you always gave her

03:26.707 --> 03:28.476
these great, tight,
squeezy hugs.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.311
When you'd hug me,
it was weak.

03:30.378 --> 03:31.445
It was like getting whacked
in the neck

03:31.512 --> 03:32.546
with a couple pieces
of spaghetti.

03:32.613 --> 03:33.681
VIRGINIA:
It's true.

03:33.747 --> 03:35.349
You used to give him
some really crappy hugs.

03:35.416 --> 03:36.984
He deserved better.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.386
BURT: So what do you say?

03:38.452 --> 03:40.120
Could I just scare her
just a little bit?

03:40.187 --> 03:41.355
No!
Come on,

03:41.422 --> 03:42.756
I want her to start
hugging me.

03:42.823 --> 03:44.692
You stay away
from my daughter.

03:44.758 --> 03:47.828
You're forbidden to be around
my daughter on Halloween.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.630
You're a monster.

03:49.697 --> 03:52.366
Seriously, there's something
wrong with you.

03:52.433 --> 03:54.167
I like to be loved, Jimmy.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.438
It's called
being a human being.

03:59.340 --> 04:02.376
* *

04:02.443 --> 04:03.944
BARNEY (over P.A.):
Attention, shoppers,

04:04.011 --> 04:05.379
just a friendly reminder--

04:05.446 --> 04:08.081
there are no bikes
allowed in the store.

04:08.148 --> 04:09.683
Thank you. Happy Halloween.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.419
Jimmy.

04:11.485 --> 04:14.288
Fine, no, it's fine.

04:14.355 --> 04:16.023
(scoffs)
Hey,

04:16.089 --> 04:18.125
No, you know what?
It's fine. I said,
"It's fine, " Wyatt.

04:18.191 --> 04:21.194
I don't know how to say
"it's fine" any nicer than that.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.262
Bye.
(phone beeps)

04:23.997 --> 04:25.333
Oh, hey.

04:25.399 --> 04:27.200
Oh, hey, what's up?

04:27.267 --> 04:29.002
Oh, we're out of candy.

04:29.069 --> 04:30.070
Maw Maw ate it all.

04:30.137 --> 04:31.305
She's on a sugar bender.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.506
She even ate a candle

04:32.573 --> 04:33.974
that smells
like a chocolate chip cookie,

04:34.041 --> 04:35.309
so...

04:35.376 --> 04:36.344
Are you okay?

04:36.410 --> 04:38.312
(sighs)
I'm fine.

04:38.379 --> 04:39.847
It's stupid.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.615
It's just one of the deli
guys is having

04:41.682 --> 04:43.250
a Halloween
party tonight, and Wyatt

04:43.317 --> 04:45.886
was supposed to come into town
for it and now he's not.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.788
You don't think
he's cheating, do you?

04:47.855 --> 04:49.156
What?
Hmm?

04:49.222 --> 04:51.291
No. No, it's just...
Oh.

04:51.359 --> 04:52.893
It's not that big of a deal.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.396
It's just, Halloween is, like,
one of my favorite holidays,

04:55.463 --> 04:57.465
and we're supposed to
be going as

04:57.531 --> 04:59.500
Batman and Robin,

04:59.567 --> 05:01.168
and now I'm just Robin.

05:01.234 --> 05:02.936
(sighs)
I'm going to look
like an idiot.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.137
Whatever,

05:04.204 --> 05:05.238
this isn't your problem.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.774
Thanks for letting me vent.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.008
Wait....

05:08.075 --> 05:09.543
BARNEY (over PA):
Just another friendly reminder

05:09.610 --> 05:11.011
that we appreciate
your business,

05:11.078 --> 05:13.814
but we can't allow bicycles
in the store.

05:13.881 --> 05:15.516
Happy Halloween.

05:15.583 --> 05:17.985
(indistinct chattering)

05:18.051 --> 05:19.753
Uh, you know,
I was, uh,

05:19.820 --> 05:21.789
hitting a few parties
myself tonight.
(sighs)

05:21.855 --> 05:24.124
In fact, I happen to have
a Batman costume

05:24.191 --> 05:25.626
from last year, so

05:25.693 --> 05:27.528
if you wanted me to,
I don't know,

05:27.595 --> 05:29.830
put it on and-and stop by
the deli guy's party,

05:29.897 --> 05:32.833
I could maybe stand near you
s-so you don't look stupid.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.568
Well, if you
don't mind,

05:34.635 --> 05:37.104
I would love to
have a Batman.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.872
I don't mind at all.

05:38.939 --> 05:41.141
JAVIER AND MARCUS:
Whoo!
(grunting)

05:41.208 --> 05:45.413
BARNEY (over PA):
Okay, I'm calling the cops
about the bike!

05:45.479 --> 05:47.715
Happy Halloween.

05:52.152 --> 05:54.354
I need you to make me
a Batman costume,

05:54.422 --> 05:56.023
and I need you
to watch Hope tonight.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.190
I'm going to a party.

05:57.257 --> 05:58.358
Can't do it.

05:58.426 --> 05:59.727
Which one?

05:59.793 --> 06:01.128
Neither.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.697
I promised nine-year-old Maw Maw
I'd take her trick-or-treating.

06:03.764 --> 06:05.899
You can make your own
Batman costume, but I used

06:05.966 --> 06:08.201
most of the black fabric
turning an old dress

06:08.268 --> 06:10.404
into a kitty cat costume.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.506
Meow.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.608
I'm ready
to go, Mommy.

06:17.878 --> 06:18.846
Meow.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.848
Dear Lord,
she's got it on backwards.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.082
(laughs)

06:22.149 --> 06:24.051
All right, sweetheart,

06:24.117 --> 06:25.018
come with me.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.386
Oh.

06:26.454 --> 06:29.089
She looks
like a transvestite ninja.

06:34.161 --> 06:35.395
Hey,

06:35.463 --> 06:36.564
can you watch
Hope tonight?

06:36.630 --> 06:38.832
Me-- the monster?

06:38.899 --> 06:40.534
You want the monster
to watch your daughter?

06:40.601 --> 06:42.002
Well, not really, no,

06:42.069 --> 06:44.104
but, you know,
I don't have a choice, so...

06:44.171 --> 06:46.373
I'm sorry, I've been forbidden
by her father to be

06:46.440 --> 06:47.708
near her
on Halloween.

06:47.775 --> 06:48.976
Besides, I got plans.

06:49.042 --> 06:50.511
I'm going egging.

06:50.578 --> 06:53.313
Yeah, you're
quite a grandfather.

06:53.380 --> 06:55.516
(giggles)

06:55.583 --> 06:58.719
I'm not cleaning this up.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.488
(sewing machine whirring)

07:02.723 --> 07:04.391
Are you sure you want
to leave her with us?

07:04.458 --> 07:06.727
'Cause you could just, say,
drop her at the fire station.

07:06.794 --> 07:08.295
What, so I can go to a party?

07:08.361 --> 07:10.197
(scoffs) I'm not going
to give my daughter away

07:10.263 --> 07:11.599
just so I can go to a party.

07:11.665 --> 07:12.866
You don't have
to leave her there for good.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.101
You just have
to act like you are.

07:14.167 --> 07:15.469
You get six hours
to change your mind.

07:15.536 --> 07:16.737
My father left me
there when I was seven

07:16.804 --> 07:18.606
after I called
him the "C" word.

07:18.672 --> 07:21.074
Five and a half hours
later, he came back for me.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.410
What kind of person would do
that just to teach you a lesson?

07:23.477 --> 07:26.780
I'll give you a hint-- it
begins with the letter "C."

07:30.918 --> 07:32.820
You ready to go home
yet, sweetheart?

07:32.886 --> 07:34.822
Mommy's feet are
getting tired.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.624
Not till my bucket's full.

07:36.690 --> 07:39.192
(laughing)
Aah!

07:39.259 --> 07:40.293
(growls)

07:40.360 --> 07:43.263
(laughing)
Hurry up!
Come on, dude! Come on.

07:43.330 --> 07:45.065
(grunts)

07:45.132 --> 07:47.334
Damn, you were fast
when you were a little girl.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.803
Maw Maw, no!

07:49.870 --> 07:51.438
(grunts)

07:51.505 --> 07:54.407
(cackling)
Happy Halloween!

07:54.474 --> 07:56.443
* *

07:56.510 --> 07:58.546
(indistinct chattering)

08:01.615 --> 08:04.184
(thunder cracks)

08:11.058 --> 08:12.993
Hey.
Oh, hey.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.361
Oh, drink this.

08:14.427 --> 08:15.495
Okay.
(both chuckle)

08:19.299 --> 08:21.068
(coughs)

08:21.134 --> 08:23.303
I decided I'm going
to have fun tonight.

08:23.370 --> 08:24.371
I can see that.

08:24.437 --> 08:25.539
Good.

08:25.606 --> 08:26.907
I'm a big fan of fun.

08:26.974 --> 08:29.810
We don't need stupid Wyatt
to have a good time, right?

08:29.877 --> 08:31.378
We certainly do not.

08:31.444 --> 08:33.313
We do not need
stupid Wyatt.

08:33.380 --> 08:34.347
(laughs)

08:34.414 --> 08:35.916
Who's watching Hope?

08:35.983 --> 08:37.851
Oh, a couple of
good friends.
Oh.

08:37.918 --> 08:39.987
She's-- she's in good hands.

08:40.053 --> 08:42.022
Huh.
Yeah.

08:42.089 --> 08:45.659
(munching)

08:45.726 --> 08:47.360
What are you doing?

08:47.427 --> 08:50.030
I got that food
out for the baby.

08:50.097 --> 08:51.565
This is baby food?

08:51.632 --> 08:52.833
What a waste.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.401
This is delicioso.

08:54.467 --> 08:56.069
It's like meat pudding.

08:56.136 --> 08:58.071
Great, Javier, you ate
all the baby food.

08:58.138 --> 09:00.140
What are we going
to feed the baby?

09:02.275 --> 09:03.911
Give her
some chips.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.613
(cooing)
We can't give
her those chips.

09:05.679 --> 09:07.280
They're hot pepper-flavored.

09:13.687 --> 09:15.388
There.
I don't even know

09:15.455 --> 09:17.758
if she has teeth.
What if she chokes on it?

09:17.825 --> 09:21.028
Chew it up and spit it
into her mouth, baby bird style.

09:21.094 --> 09:22.730
That's gross.
It's not gross; birds do it.

09:22.796 --> 09:25.866
Besides, I already
lickeded it.

09:25.933 --> 09:28.301
What difference does it make
if you chew it up?

09:35.542 --> 09:38.345
(phone rings)

09:38.411 --> 09:39.647
Hello.

09:39.713 --> 09:40.781
How's it going?

09:40.848 --> 09:41.815
JAVIER (over phone): Great.

09:41.882 --> 09:43.183
We're feeding
the baby.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.117
How's the party?

09:44.184 --> 09:45.452
Oh, great.

09:45.518 --> 09:47.988
She's really, she's really mad
at her boyfriend.

09:48.055 --> 09:50.357
I think she's looking
to get back at him.

09:50.423 --> 09:51.524
That's fantastic.

09:51.591 --> 09:54.194
All right, well,
I was just checking in.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.996
Uh, if she wakes up in the night
and she seems hungry,

09:56.063 --> 09:57.464
there's more food
in the pantry.

09:57.530 --> 10:00.600
Okay, if we run out of
food, we'll look there.

10:00.668 --> 10:03.003
The pantry.

10:03.070 --> 10:05.238
And when she goes
to bed, make sure

10:05.305 --> 10:06.606
she has her favorite...

10:06.674 --> 10:08.375
("White Night"
by The Postelles playing)

10:08.441 --> 10:10.343
* I won't go,
I won't stay... *

10:10.410 --> 10:11.611
I got to go.

10:11.679 --> 10:16.817
* Till you give me a taste *

10:16.884 --> 10:20.888
* I wanna feel like that *

10:20.954 --> 10:25.025
* So I shake and you sweat *

10:25.092 --> 10:28.495
* And we'll dance,
no, let's sing *

10:28.561 --> 10:30.030
* Oh, no, no, no, no *

10:30.097 --> 10:34.868
* I wanna feel like that *

10:34.935 --> 10:37.771
* So tell me do you like that? *
* I don't think I like that *

10:37.838 --> 10:42.575
* Well, maybe
we should stop this *
* I wish we never started *

10:42.642 --> 10:46.847
* Oh, maybe we should go,
I wanna feel okay *

10:48.415 --> 10:52.119
* I got a problem
and it drains my soul *

10:52.185 --> 10:54.988
* Don't tell, nobody knows *

10:55.055 --> 10:57.024
* I used to feel all right... *

10:57.090 --> 10:58.125
Wyatt?

10:58.191 --> 10:59.026
(laughs)

10:59.092 --> 11:01.294
Wyatt?

11:03.496 --> 11:04.631
What are you doing here?

11:04.698 --> 11:06.800
Surprise. Gotcha.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.035
You didn't think
I was really gonna

11:08.101 --> 11:09.536
stand you up on
Halloween, did you?

11:09.602 --> 11:10.804
Yes.
(laughs)

11:10.871 --> 11:13.406
Oh, my God,
I can't believe you're here!

11:13.473 --> 11:14.975
Tonight's gonna
be awesome!

11:15.042 --> 11:16.509
Y-You guys have fun, okay?

11:16.576 --> 11:17.477
I'm gonna...

11:17.544 --> 11:18.511
Hey.

11:18.578 --> 11:20.247
You're with us tonight.

11:20.313 --> 11:22.149
What do you think,
I'm gonna ditch my friend

11:22.215 --> 11:24.051
just 'cause
my boyfriend shows up?

11:24.117 --> 11:25.218
No, I mean, it's okay...

11:25.285 --> 11:26.686
Oh, come on, man,
let's party.

11:26.754 --> 11:28.889
(laughs)

11:31.158 --> 11:35.195
* Oh, and it's a long way down
in New York City... *

11:40.500 --> 11:41.501
Okay, we're
almost full.

11:41.568 --> 11:42.669
This one
should do it.

11:42.736 --> 11:43.804
And it's feet
soaking in

11:43.871 --> 11:46.573
Jolly Rancher martini
time for Mommy.

11:46.639 --> 11:47.540
Hi.

11:47.607 --> 11:48.876
Trick or treat!

11:48.942 --> 11:50.778
Where's your kid?

11:50.844 --> 11:52.645
She's the kid.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.515
Trick or treat!

11:55.582 --> 11:57.717
No candy for people over 14.

11:57.785 --> 11:59.486
This is trick-or-treating,
not panhandling.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.855
Trust me, I understand
where you're coming from,

12:01.922 --> 12:03.323
but I just want
to go home.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.793
If you could maybe just give her
some raisins or maybe an apple

12:05.859 --> 12:08.395
or something nasty one of your
kids got; you just re-candy.

12:08.461 --> 12:09.329
Trick or treat!

12:09.396 --> 12:11.298
(scoffs)

12:11.364 --> 12:14.501
Mommy, can we do a trick?

12:14.567 --> 12:18.772
You bet your batty
nine-year-old ass we can.

12:18.839 --> 12:21.241
Uh, uh, Sabrina?

12:21.308 --> 12:22.976
I-I think I'm
gonna take off.

12:23.911 --> 12:26.513
(sniffing)

12:26.579 --> 12:27.547
Hey, what's going on?

12:27.614 --> 12:29.817
Nothing.

12:29.883 --> 12:32.485
I'm just staring at her.

12:32.552 --> 12:33.653
That's all.

12:33.720 --> 12:34.922
I'm not sniffing her feet,

12:34.988 --> 12:36.689
if that's what you're asking.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.358
Was not doing that.

12:39.827 --> 12:41.394
Oh, man, she's
passed out, huh?

12:41.461 --> 12:43.563
Uh, yeah, I think so.

12:43.630 --> 12:45.098
MAN:
Wyatt, come on, let's go!

12:45.165 --> 12:47.034
(sighs)
Yeah, a bunch of guys
I went to high school with

12:47.100 --> 12:48.301
want me to go to
another party.

12:48.368 --> 12:49.636
Would you mind
keeping an eye on her?

12:49.702 --> 12:51.438
Um...

12:51.504 --> 12:52.906
Wait. Are you asking me

12:52.973 --> 12:54.875
to stay here
with your passed-out girlfriend?

12:54.942 --> 12:56.176
(chuckles)
MAN:
Hey, bat dudes?

12:56.243 --> 12:57.911
How about you both go
to the party,

12:57.978 --> 12:59.546
and I'll keep an eye on her?

12:59.612 --> 13:01.514
Look...
(chuckles)

13:01.581 --> 13:03.483
I'm asking you to stay here
with a passed-out friend.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.986
Sabrina said you guys have
been hanging out a lot lately,

13:06.053 --> 13:07.554
which I'm totally cool
with, by the way.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.656
I appreciate you keeping her out
of trouble while I'm at school.

13:09.722 --> 13:11.925
Okay. Uh, yeah.

13:11.992 --> 13:13.526
No problem.

13:16.063 --> 13:17.430
You're a good guy, Jerry.
(chuckles)

13:17.497 --> 13:20.333
Uh... Jimmy.

13:22.002 --> 13:24.537
Ah, come on, Maw Maw,
throw it high,

13:24.604 --> 13:27.374
just like you're welcoming
Charles Lindbergh home.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.409
(siren whoops)

13:29.476 --> 13:31.144
(laughs)

13:32.980 --> 13:34.214
MALE OFFICER:
What's going on?

13:34.281 --> 13:36.683
Mommy and I are
doing a trick.

13:36.749 --> 13:39.352
The bitch who lives here
wouldn't give us any candy.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.088
You're not really
gonna hassle us

13:41.154 --> 13:43.123
for pulling a prank
on Halloween, are you?

13:43.190 --> 13:45.725
I might, seeing as
the pranksters are both adults,

13:45.792 --> 13:48.628
this is my house,
and I'm married to the bitch.

13:48.695 --> 13:50.230
Oh.

13:50.297 --> 13:51.731
(glass breaking)

13:51.798 --> 13:54.667
Go! Go! Go! Go!

13:54.734 --> 13:58.071
Hey, hey, get back here!

13:58.138 --> 13:59.606
All right, Maw Maw,

13:59.672 --> 14:01.608
let's straighten out that
caddywhompus throw of yours.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.576
We're gonna be wiping our butts
with takeout bags

14:03.643 --> 14:05.578
for the next week,
so let's make this count!

14:05.645 --> 14:07.580
* *

14:18.959 --> 14:21.328
(owl hooting)

14:26.566 --> 14:28.468
(panting)

14:33.073 --> 14:36.476
Oh, dude, I'm telling you
for the last time, okay?

14:36.543 --> 14:38.545
I got this.

14:38.611 --> 14:40.213
(groans softly)

14:51.058 --> 14:52.993
(gasps)
(grunts)

14:55.062 --> 14:56.796
(panting)

14:56.863 --> 14:58.331
(Sabrina giggling)

14:58.398 --> 15:00.533
Oh, no, don't take
me in here.

15:00.600 --> 15:01.868
I hate haunted houses.

15:01.935 --> 15:03.070
It's my house.

15:03.136 --> 15:04.337
It's not haunted.

15:04.404 --> 15:07.040
My dad says it was built
on an Indian burial ground,

15:07.107 --> 15:09.676
but now I think he just
said that so I'd hug him.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.144
(Jimmy grunts)

15:11.211 --> 15:13.680
(Jimmy panting,
Sabrina laughing)

15:13.746 --> 15:15.382
(laughing)

15:15.448 --> 15:16.916
(sighs)

15:16.984 --> 15:19.919
Come here.

15:24.057 --> 15:26.259
(sighing)

15:34.067 --> 15:36.036
Whoa.

15:36.103 --> 15:37.837
(chuckles)

15:37.904 --> 15:39.973
That was... amazing.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.408
(sighs) Yeah.

15:41.474 --> 15:43.376
Where'd you learn
to kiss like that?

15:43.443 --> 15:44.444
(chuckles)

15:44.511 --> 15:46.046
You better not

15:46.113 --> 15:48.315
be cheating on me, Wyatt.

15:48.381 --> 15:49.949
Oh.

15:50.017 --> 15:52.319
(sighs)

15:52.385 --> 15:54.321
Oh.

16:03.430 --> 16:06.033
MARCUS:
"Dude, Javier got a booty call,
and if you remember,

16:06.099 --> 16:08.901
"I didn't want to do this
in the first place.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.170
"It's cool, though.

16:10.237 --> 16:11.938
"I took Hope
to the fire station.

16:12.005 --> 16:15.508
You've got until 6:00 a.m.
to go get her back."

16:18.311 --> 16:20.280
What's going on?

16:20.347 --> 16:22.482
I'm gonna lose Hope.

16:26.719 --> 16:28.621
What do you mean,
you're gonna lose Hope?

16:28.688 --> 16:30.090
Where is she?

16:30.157 --> 16:32.059
She's at the fire station.
Those idiots

16:32.125 --> 16:33.293
dropped her off there
and must have thought

16:33.360 --> 16:34.561
I would have been home sooner.

16:34.627 --> 16:35.762
And I've got five minutes
to get her back.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.030
Where are my keys?!

16:37.097 --> 16:38.431
You can't drive.
You been drinking.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.133
You're right.
You drive.
Jimmy,

16:40.200 --> 16:42.135
I've been egging houses
with 12-year-olds all night.

16:42.202 --> 16:43.770
You think there's
any possible way I'm sober?

16:43.836 --> 16:46.573
(panting)

16:46.639 --> 16:48.708
Come on, hurry up!

16:48.775 --> 16:51.010
I can't! I have a flat!

16:51.078 --> 16:52.312
Don't worry. I'll get her.

16:52.379 --> 16:54.481
Daddy's gonna make
everything okay.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.551
(grunting)

16:58.618 --> 17:00.520
(panting)

17:08.728 --> 17:09.729
You got her!

17:09.796 --> 17:11.298
Yeah.

17:11.364 --> 17:14.367
Showed 'em my I.D.,
told them I was the grandpa.

17:14.434 --> 17:15.768
I got there just in time.

17:18.705 --> 17:20.240
(laughs)

17:20.307 --> 17:23.643
Yeah, that's the stuff.

17:24.977 --> 17:27.247
(laughs)

17:37.490 --> 17:39.626
(soft growling)
So, how was the party?

17:39.692 --> 17:40.860
I kissed her.

17:40.927 --> 17:41.961
Get out of here!

17:42.028 --> 17:43.496
Yeah, only she
was really drunk,

17:43.563 --> 17:45.498
and she thought
she was kissing her boyfriend,

17:45.565 --> 17:47.600
but apparently,
I'm a better kisser than him,

17:47.667 --> 17:48.501
so, that's good.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.403
BURT:
You're welcome.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.205
You got that from your dad.

17:52.272 --> 17:54.274
I'm an excellent
tongue kisser.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.244
Gross.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.812
That's weird.

17:59.879 --> 18:01.414
What?

18:01.481 --> 18:03.383
There's drool on the sheet,
but it's still wet.

18:03.450 --> 18:04.884
If she was at the fire station

18:04.951 --> 18:06.286
for the last six hours,

18:06.353 --> 18:07.320
how is it still wet?

18:07.387 --> 18:09.189
Maybe the roof is leaking.

18:09.256 --> 18:10.790
Well, it's not raining,

18:10.857 --> 18:13.092
and the ceiling is dry.

18:13.160 --> 18:15.295
Maybe she
spit up an ice cube?

18:17.564 --> 18:19.466
What did you do?

18:19.532 --> 18:21.568
Okay.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.603
(distant siren)

18:25.205 --> 18:27.574
(siren blaring)

18:35.815 --> 18:37.083
What's up?

18:37.150 --> 18:39.719
We're baby-watching
the baby.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.120
Get out of here.

18:41.188 --> 18:42.422
I sang her to sleep
with a medley

18:42.489 --> 18:43.790
of slow Beatles songs.

18:43.856 --> 18:45.758
Marcus did the whistling part
of "Blackbird."

18:45.825 --> 18:47.160
It was... beautiful.

18:47.227 --> 18:48.561
So Jimmy's not home yet?

18:49.462 --> 18:50.797
No.

18:50.863 --> 18:53.600
Oh, this is gonna be good.

18:56.869 --> 18:57.970
(air hissing)

18:58.037 --> 18:59.739
He's coming.

18:59.806 --> 19:02.309
He's coming! He's coming!
He's coming!

19:04.677 --> 19:06.279
No. No, don't
take me in here.

19:06.346 --> 19:07.680
I hate haunted houses.

19:28.335 --> 19:30.069
What's going on?

19:30.136 --> 19:31.704
Don't worry. I'll get her.

19:31.771 --> 19:34.374
Daddy's gonna make
everything okay.

19:43.450 --> 19:45.652
Yeah, that's the stuff.

19:46.953 --> 19:47.854
You're a monster!

19:47.920 --> 19:50.056
I'm sorry, but when
you turned 13,

19:50.122 --> 19:51.724
you barely
hugged me anymore.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.560
Then that damn
high five came along.

19:53.626 --> 19:55.928
I had to do whatever I could to
feel your chest against mine.

19:55.995 --> 19:57.163
Get out!

19:57.230 --> 20:00.166
Fine. Be mad, but you
can't take back that hug.

20:00.233 --> 20:02.535
That was a great hug!

20:03.836 --> 20:05.705
(wind howling)

20:08.575 --> 20:11.244
(crackling thunder)

20:11.311 --> 20:13.813
(Hope crying)

20:16.115 --> 20:17.284
It's all right.

20:17.350 --> 20:19.252
Hey, it's just thunder.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.053
Okay, come up.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.022
(thunderclaps)
Wow.

20:23.089 --> 20:25.592
Somebody's holding on tight.

20:25.658 --> 20:28.528
A hug is a powerful thing.

20:28.595 --> 20:30.997
It makes you feel wanted,
needed and loved,

20:31.063 --> 20:34.701
all at the same time,
and when your kid hugs you,

20:34.767 --> 20:38.237
well, I can see
how you get addicted.

20:38.305 --> 20:42.342
Maybe my dad's
not a monster.

20:42.409 --> 20:45.978
* I met a girl on Halloween *

20:46.045 --> 20:49.416
* Well, she was lost
and I was drunk *

20:49.482 --> 20:56.923
* And it was dark
and cold out when we left *

20:56.989 --> 20:59.926
* And as we walked,
the rain started *

20:59.992 --> 21:03.930
* The leaves softened
with every step *

21:03.996 --> 21:05.698
* And all around us *

21:05.765 --> 21:10.670
* People slept alone
with their dreams *

21:10.737 --> 21:17.610
* Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh, ooh *

21:17.677 --> 21:21.113
* Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh *

21:21.180 --> 21:25.051
* Ooh, ooh. *

21:28.220 --> 21:30.357
(retching)

21:32.425 --> 21:34.193
CHILD: Happy Halloween!

21:34.260 --> 21:35.462
Adios, Amigos.
