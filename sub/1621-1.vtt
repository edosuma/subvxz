WEBVTT

02:13.050 --> 02:15.134
Well struck.

02:15.219 --> 02:16.886
Well struck, dog.

02:21.225 --> 02:22.725
Did you like that?

02:22.810 --> 02:24.685
It was well struck, Your Grace.

02:24.770 --> 02:27.230
I already said it was well struck.

02:28.232 --> 02:30.191
Yes, Your Grace.

02:37.866 --> 02:40.201
- Who's next?
- Lothor Brune,

02:40.285 --> 02:43.496
freerider in the service of Lord Baelish.

02:43.580 --> 02:46.749
Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard.

02:49.670 --> 02:52.463
Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard!

02:52.548 --> 02:53.965
Here I am.

02:54.049 --> 02:56.050
Here I am.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.891
Sorry, Your Grace.

03:04.810 --> 03:06.686
My deepest apologies.

03:06.770 --> 03:08.396
- Are you drunk?
- No.

03:09.064 --> 03:11.190
No. No, Your Grace.

03:11.275 --> 03:13.860
- I had two cups of wine.
- Two cups?

03:13.944 --> 03:15.862
That's not much at all.

03:16.488 --> 03:18.573
Please, have another cup.

03:18.657 --> 03:20.116
Are you sure, Your Grace?

03:20.200 --> 03:22.493
Yes. To celebrate my name day.

03:22.578 --> 03:24.996
Have two. Have as much as you like.

03:26.331 --> 03:27.915
I would be honored, Your Grace.

03:29.585 --> 03:32.628
Ser Meryn, help Ser Dontos
celebrate my name day.

03:33.338 --> 03:34.755
See that he drinks his fill.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.901
You can't.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.111
What did you say?

03:58.447 --> 04:00.239
Did you say I can't?

04:00.324 --> 04:01.908
I only meant

04:01.992 --> 04:04.869
it would be bad luck
to kill a man on your name day.

04:04.953 --> 04:07.121
What kind of stupid peasant's superstition...

04:07.664 --> 04:09.040
The girl is right.

04:09.124 --> 04:12.418
What a man sows on his name day,
he reaps all year.

04:15.881 --> 04:17.380
Take him away.

04:17.466 --> 04:19.507
I'll have him killed tomorrow, the fool.

04:23.388 --> 04:26.140
He is a fool. You're so clever to see it.

04:26.808 --> 04:29.393
He'll make a much better fool than a knight.

04:29.478 --> 04:32.480
He doesn't deserve
the mercy of a quick death.

04:34.191 --> 04:36.984
Did you hear my lady, Ser Dontos?

04:37.069 --> 04:40.112
From this day, you'll be my new fool.

04:40.197 --> 04:42.406
Thank you, Your Grace.

04:42.491 --> 04:45.618
And you, my lady, thank you.

04:45.702 --> 04:47.370
Beloved nephew.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.421
We looked for you on the battlefield.

04:59.508 --> 05:02.051
You were nowhere to be found.

05:03.553 --> 05:05.638
I've been here, ruling the kingdoms.

05:05.722 --> 05:08.391
What a fine job you've done.

05:09.393 --> 05:10.559
Look at you.

05:12.104 --> 05:14.188
More beautiful than ever.

05:14.272 --> 05:15.982
And you!

05:16.066 --> 05:18.317
You're going to be bigger than the Hound,

05:18.402 --> 05:20.820
but much better looking.

05:20.904 --> 05:22.822
This one doesn't like me.

05:22.906 --> 05:24.740
Can't imagine why.

05:24.825 --> 05:27.326
- We heard you were dead.
- I'm glad you're not dead.

05:28.370 --> 05:30.997
Me, too, dear. Death is so boring,

05:31.081 --> 05:34.375
especially now,
with so much excitement in the world.

05:35.377 --> 05:36.711
My lady, I'm sorry for your loss.

05:38.588 --> 05:39.839
Her loss?

05:39.923 --> 05:41.841
Her father was a confessed traitor.

05:41.925 --> 05:43.509
But still her father.

05:43.593 --> 05:46.262
Surely, having so recently lost your own
beloved father, you can sympathize.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.436
My father was a traitor.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.396
My mother and brother are traitors, too.

05:55.897 --> 05:57.982
I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey.

05:59.818 --> 06:01.944
Of course you are.

06:03.989 --> 06:07.825
Well, enjoy your name day, Your Grace.

06:07.909 --> 06:09.577
Wish I could stay and celebrate,

06:09.661 --> 06:12.455
but there is work to be done.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.540
What work?

06:14.624 --> 06:16.584
Why are you here?

06:20.297 --> 06:24.675
A raven arrived from the citadel
this morning, Your Grace.

06:26.011 --> 06:27.595
The conclave has met,

06:27.679 --> 06:31.140
considered reports from maesters
all over the Seven Kingdoms,

06:31.850 --> 06:34.351
and declared this great summer

06:34.770 --> 06:37.271
done at last.

06:37.355 --> 06:40.149
The longest summer in living memory.

06:40.525 --> 06:43.778
The peasants say, a long summer means
an even longer winter.

06:43.862 --> 06:45.613
A common superstition.

06:45.697 --> 06:48.074
We have enough wheat for a five-year winter.

06:48.158 --> 06:50.493
If it lasts any longer,

06:51.078 --> 06:53.037
we'll have fewer peasants.

06:53.121 --> 06:56.499
The city's drowning in refugees,
Your Grace, fleeing the war.

06:56.583 --> 06:59.627
We have nowhere to house them.
And with winter coming, it'll only get worse.

06:59.711 --> 07:03.005
You command the city watch,
do you not, Lord Slynt?

07:04.341 --> 07:06.092
I do, Your Grace.

07:06.176 --> 07:08.177
And are you not a lord at my command?

07:08.261 --> 07:11.847
I owe my title and lands
to your generosity, Your Grace.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.433
Then do your job.
Shut the gates to the peasants.

07:14.518 --> 07:17.436
They belong in the field, not our capital.

07:17.521 --> 07:19.105
Yes, Your Grace.

07:25.862 --> 07:26.904
Don't get up.

07:28.365 --> 07:31.951
More ravishing than ever, big sister.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.913
War agrees with you.

07:35.997 --> 07:38.541
Forgive the interruption. Carry on.

07:40.377 --> 07:41.502
What are you doing here?

07:42.462 --> 07:45.214
It's been a remarkable journey.

07:45.841 --> 07:48.884
I pissed off the edge of the Wall,

07:49.886 --> 07:51.804
I slept in a sky cell,

07:51.888 --> 07:54.056
I fought with the hill tribes.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.683
So many adventures,

07:56.893 --> 07:59.520
so much to be thankful for.

07:59.604 --> 08:03.482
What are you doing here?
This is the small council.

08:03.567 --> 08:08.320
Yes, well, I do believe the Hand of the King
is welcome at all small council meetings.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.114
Our father is Hand of the King.

08:10.198 --> 08:13.200
Yes, but in his absence...

08:20.584 --> 08:22.877
Your father has named Lord Tyrion

08:22.961 --> 08:25.504
to serve as hand in his stead while he fights.

08:25.589 --> 08:28.007
Out! All of you out!

08:32.929 --> 08:35.556
I would like to know
how you tricked Father into this.

08:35.640 --> 08:39.184
If I were capable of tricking Father,
I'd be emperor of the world by now.

08:39.895 --> 08:41.812
You brought this on yourself.

08:42.272 --> 08:43.313
I've done nothing.

08:43.398 --> 08:45.191
Quite right, you did nothing

08:45.275 --> 08:47.526
when your son called for Ned Stark's head.

08:47.611 --> 08:49.528
Now the entire North has risen up against us.

08:49.613 --> 08:52.031
- I tried to stop it.
- Did you? You failed.

08:52.115 --> 08:55.326
That bit of theater
will haunt our family for a generation.

08:55.410 --> 08:59.288
- Robb Stark is a child.
- Who's won every battle he's fought.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.707
Do you understand we're losing the war?

09:01.791 --> 09:04.877
- What do you know about warfare?
- Nothing.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.712
But I know people.

09:06.796 --> 09:11.467
And I know that our enemies hate each other
almost as much as they hate us.

09:16.097 --> 09:18.724
- Joffrey is king.
- Joffrey is king.

09:19.476 --> 09:21.143
You are here to advise him.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.895
I'm only here to advise him.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.481
And if the king listens to what I say,

09:25.565 --> 09:29.068
the king might just get his Uncle Jaime back.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.321
How?

09:32.405 --> 09:33.948
You love your children.

09:34.032 --> 09:37.076
It's your one redeeming quality.
That and your cheekbones.

09:38.495 --> 09:41.413
The Starks love their children as well.

09:41.498 --> 09:43.707
- And we have two of them.
- One.

09:45.627 --> 09:48.420
- One?
- Arya, little animal, she disappeared.

09:48.505 --> 09:51.507
Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke?

09:53.635 --> 09:56.553
We had three Starks to trade.

09:56.638 --> 09:59.265
You chopped one's head off
and let another escape.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.351
Father will be furious.

10:03.520 --> 10:04.979
It must be odd for you

10:07.524 --> 10:09.942
to be the disappointing child.

10:17.617 --> 10:21.245
My lord, may the old gods
watch over your brother

10:21.329 --> 10:23.956
and all our Northern sons.

10:24.040 --> 10:27.876
The walls of my holdfast
will not stand the winter.

10:27.961 --> 10:32.089
The stones were last mortared
in the time of King Aerys,

10:32.173 --> 10:36.760
and I'm afraid the masons today
are not fit to carry their fathers' hammers.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.596
When I was a boy,

10:39.681 --> 10:45.060
I remember seeing them put up a new tower
at Torrhen's Square in a summer.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.104
Men worked back then.

10:47.188 --> 10:52.484
Today, my holdfast looks like it was built
by drunk children.

10:52.569 --> 10:56.655
At night you can hear the wind
howling through the gaps.

10:57.365 --> 10:58.991
Gods forbid it rains.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.910
Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall.

11:01.995 --> 11:06.915
Maintenance of a holdfast generally falls
to the lord of that holdfast.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.500
Generally, yes,

11:08.585 --> 11:12.004
but I've sent all the young men off
to fight Robb Stark's war.

11:12.088 --> 11:15.215
King Robb. And it's not his war.

11:15.300 --> 11:17.176
He didn't choose it.

11:17.260 --> 11:20.763
Maybe not, my lord,
but he called in his banners and took the men.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.514
Joffrey killed my father,

11:23.141 --> 11:25.017
your liege lord.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.478
Do you remember your vows, ser?

11:27.562 --> 11:29.396
Of course I remember!

11:29.481 --> 11:32.524
We can spare four masons
for a week, my lord.

11:32.609 --> 11:35.569
Will that be sufficient to repair your walls?

11:35.653 --> 11:37.696
I believe it will.

11:43.912 --> 11:46.622
We didn't want him here all day, did we?

11:47.540 --> 11:50.501
I didn't like the way
he was talking about Robb.

11:50.585 --> 11:52.252
Nor did I.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.591
But listening to people
you'd rather not listen to

11:57.675 --> 12:01.553
is one of your responsibilities
as Lord of Winterfell.

12:05.141 --> 12:06.892
Lord Portan.

12:06.976 --> 12:09.895
My lord, may the old gods
watch over your brother

12:09.979 --> 12:11.647
and all our Northern sons.

13:00.655 --> 13:04.032
Boil this for an hour and drink the tea.

13:05.160 --> 13:07.536
Makes all your pain go away.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.121
Don't have any pain.

13:10.248 --> 13:11.707
Lucky for you.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.293
That way.

13:17.547 --> 13:19.798
You've been having those dreams again.

13:19.883 --> 13:21.550
I don't dream.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.135
Everyone dreams.

13:23.219 --> 13:24.803
I don't.

13:26.222 --> 13:28.223
Heard some of the men
talking about the comet.

13:29.017 --> 13:30.517
They say it's an omen.

13:30.602 --> 13:34.021
They say it means Robb
will win a great victory in the South.

13:34.105 --> 13:35.564
Did they?

13:37.650 --> 13:41.153
I heard some other fools say
it's Lannister Red.

13:41.237 --> 13:44.406
Means the Lannisters
will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long.

13:44.491 --> 13:47.951
Heard a stable boy say it's the color of blood

13:48.036 --> 13:50.204
to mark the death of your father.

13:54.167 --> 13:57.336
The stars don't fall for men.

13:57.420 --> 13:59.880
Red comet means one thing, boy.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.591
Dragons.

14:04.636 --> 14:07.346
The dragons are all dead.

14:07.430 --> 14:09.765
They've been dead for centuries.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.053
Mmm.

14:53.142 --> 14:55.727
What did your brother say
about them, Khaleesi?

14:55.812 --> 14:57.479
He said they ate meat.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.148
He didn't tell you what kind of meat?

15:01.359 --> 15:04.236
My brother didn't know
anything about dragons.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.322
He didn't know anything about anything.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.412
Eh.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.233
She was Drogo's first gift to me.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.028
I remember.

15:48.197 --> 15:50.782
I promised to protect them.

15:50.867 --> 15:53.118
Promised them
their enemies would die screaming.

15:53.202 --> 15:55.579
How do I make starvation scream?

15:55.872 --> 15:58.373
A trick I never learned, I'm afraid.

16:00.543 --> 16:02.711
Does it ever end?

16:02.795 --> 16:04.630
This is further east than I've ever been.

16:04.714 --> 16:07.799
But, yes, Khaleesi,
everything ends, even the Red Waste.

16:07.884 --> 16:10.302
And you're sure there's no other way?

16:10.386 --> 16:13.013
If we go south to the land of the Lhazareen,

16:13.097 --> 16:15.599
the Lamb Men will kill us
and take your dragons.

16:15.683 --> 16:17.476
If we go west to the Dothraki Sea,

16:17.560 --> 16:21.146
the first khalasar we meet
will kill us and take your dragons.

16:21.230 --> 16:23.649
No one will take my dragons.

16:25.026 --> 16:27.653
They are too weak to fight,

16:27.737 --> 16:29.821
as are your people.

16:29.906 --> 16:31.990
You must be their strength.

16:33.076 --> 16:35.035
As you are mine.

16:47.256 --> 16:51.677
Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro.
Take our remaining horses.

16:51.803 --> 16:56.181
You will ride east, you southeast,
and you northeast.

16:56.891 --> 16:59.559
What do we seek, Khaleesi?

16:59.727 --> 17:05.773
Cities, living or dead. Caravans and people.
Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea.

17:06.776 --> 17:11.445
Find how far the Red Waste extends
before us, and what lies on the other side.

17:22.208 --> 17:23.750
Rakharo.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.796
You are my last hope, blood of my blood.

17:28.423 --> 17:31.383
I will not fail you, blood of my blood.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.302
You never have.

17:39.642 --> 17:42.769
This is bad time to start.

18:39.160 --> 18:41.119
Having a rough time of it?

18:41.204 --> 18:42.704
Nothing's killed me yet.

18:42.789 --> 18:45.457
- Your arse killed the sledge.
- You offered me a ride.

18:45.541 --> 18:48.460
I just wanted you to shut up
about your damn blisters.

19:02.767 --> 19:05.519
I was born in a place like this.

19:05.603 --> 19:08.522
Later, I fell on hard times.

19:10.316 --> 19:12.025
Are those girls?

19:12.109 --> 19:13.860
Craster's daughters.

19:14.612 --> 19:17.572
I haven't seen a girl in six months.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.741
I'd keep on not seeing them if I were you.

19:20.743 --> 19:22.911
What, he don't like people
messing with his daughters?

19:22.995 --> 19:25.580
He don't like people messing with his wives.

19:28.084 --> 19:31.419
He marries his daughters,
and they give him more daughters.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.588
And on and on it goes.

19:34.215 --> 19:36.550
- That's foul.
- It's beyond foul.

19:36.634 --> 19:40.470
All the other wildlings
for a hundred leagues have disappeared.

19:40.555 --> 19:42.514
Craster's still here.

19:42.598 --> 19:45.016
He must be doing something right.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.520
What happens to the boys?

19:48.604 --> 19:49.729
Hmm?

19:49.814 --> 19:51.523
He marries his daughters.

19:52.275 --> 19:54.484
What does he do with his sons?

19:57.280 --> 20:01.074
He said he planned to stop here
on his way to the Frostfangs.

20:01.158 --> 20:02.742
People make all sorts of plans.

20:02.827 --> 20:06.204
I haven't seen Benjen Stark in three years.

20:06.289 --> 20:07.706
Haven't missed him.

20:07.790 --> 20:10.375
Always treated me like scum.

20:11.627 --> 20:14.462
Haven't had any good wine for a long time.

20:14.547 --> 20:17.382
You Southerners make good wine,
I'll give you that.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.384
We're not Southerners.

20:19.468 --> 20:21.094
Who's this little girl?

20:22.722 --> 20:25.432
You're prettier than half my daughters.

20:25.516 --> 20:28.810
You got a nice wet twat between your legs?

20:28.895 --> 20:30.645
What's your name?

20:30.730 --> 20:32.647
- Jon Snow.
- Snow, eh?

20:32.815 --> 20:35.650
Listen to me, bastard.

20:35.776 --> 20:39.696
All you lot from south of the Wall,
you're Southerners.

20:39.780 --> 20:43.450
But now you're in the North, the real North.

20:43.743 --> 20:44.993
The lad meant no harm.

20:46.662 --> 20:50.081
I catch that pretty little bastard
talking to my daughters...

20:50.166 --> 20:54.044
No one will talk to your daughters,
you have my word.

20:54.128 --> 20:57.172
Now, sit down and shut your mouth.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.427
You bring any of that good wine with you?

21:02.511 --> 21:04.095
We did.

21:04.221 --> 21:06.806
We passed through
six villages on the way here.

21:06.891 --> 21:08.767
All six were abandoned.

21:09.810 --> 21:11.728
Where have all the wildlings gone?

21:11.812 --> 21:15.190
I could tell you, but I'm thirsty.

21:15.650 --> 21:17.651
There's a barrel of Dornish wine
on the sledge.

21:17.735 --> 21:20.320
- Bring it in here.
- Yes, Commander.

21:20.404 --> 21:23.490
You want to know
where they've all gone?

21:23.574 --> 21:27.577
North, to join up with Mance Rayder.

21:28.996 --> 21:30.705
Your old friend.

21:31.082 --> 21:33.333
He's no friend of mine.

21:33.417 --> 21:37.796
- He broke his vows, betrayed his brothers.
- Aye.

21:37.880 --> 21:40.966
But once he was just a poor black crow.

21:41.050 --> 21:43.885
And now he's King-beyond-the-Wall.

21:43.970 --> 21:46.388
He's been calling himself that for years.

21:46.472 --> 21:50.058
What's he king of? A frozen lake somewhere?

21:51.560 --> 21:53.603
That's a good-looking ax.

21:53.688 --> 21:55.647
Fresh forged?

21:57.775 --> 21:59.234
Give it here.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.529
You'll have another one made at Castle Black.

22:02.613 --> 22:04.572
Here.

22:05.992 --> 22:08.118
That's some lovely steel.

22:12.081 --> 22:15.000
You want to know
what Mance Rayder is doing?

22:15.084 --> 22:16.418
Gathering an army.

22:17.294 --> 22:20.839
What I hear, he's already got more men
than any of your Southern Kings.

22:20.923 --> 22:24.175
And where does he plan marching this army?

22:24.260 --> 22:27.220
When you're all the way north,
there's only one direction to go.

22:29.598 --> 22:33.810
These are bad times to be
living alone in the wild.

22:34.270 --> 22:36.312
The cold winds are rising.

22:37.606 --> 22:41.026
Let them come. My roots are sunk deep.

22:42.611 --> 22:44.571
Wife,

22:44.655 --> 22:48.616
tell the Lord Crow how content we are.

22:49.076 --> 22:51.036
This is our place.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.912
Our husband keeps us safe.

22:52.997 --> 22:55.999
Better to live free than die a slave.

22:58.544 --> 23:01.504
Don't it make
you jealous, old man,

23:01.589 --> 23:06.885
to see me with all these young wives
and you with no one to warm your bed?

23:06.969 --> 23:09.012
We chose different paths.

23:09.096 --> 23:13.266
Aye, and you chose the path
with no one but boys on it.

23:15.311 --> 23:18.271
You'll be wanting to sleep
beneath my roof, I suppose,

23:18.355 --> 23:20.440
and eat me out of pigs.

23:20.524 --> 23:22.400
A roof would be welcome.

23:22.485 --> 23:23.902
It's been hard riding.

23:23.986 --> 23:27.197
We've brought our own food
and good steel for you.

23:29.825 --> 23:32.535
Any man lays a hand on one of my wives,

23:33.412 --> 23:35.246
he loses the hand.

23:37.458 --> 23:41.211
And I see this one staring too long,

23:41.295 --> 23:44.297
I might just gouge his eyes out.

23:44.507 --> 23:47.717
Your roof, your rules.

24:00.731 --> 24:02.398
Who am I?

24:03.192 --> 24:06.611
- Who am I?
- Lord Commander.

24:06.695 --> 24:09.781
- And who are you?
- Jon Snow.

24:09.865 --> 24:11.241
Who are you?

24:12.701 --> 24:14.202
Your steward.

24:14.703 --> 24:16.704
You want to lead one day?

24:19.750 --> 24:21.960
Then learn how to follow.

24:39.520 --> 24:43.231
Lord of Light,
come to us in our darkness.

24:44.233 --> 24:47.360
We offer you these false gods.

24:48.279 --> 24:51.114
Take them and cast your light upon us,

24:52.908 --> 24:56.244
for the night is dark and full of terrors.

24:57.079 --> 25:00.248
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

25:02.626 --> 25:04.544
After the long summer,

25:04.628 --> 25:07.505
darkness will fall heavy on the world.

25:07.590 --> 25:10.175
The stars will bleed.

25:10.342 --> 25:12.844
We need to stop her.

25:12.928 --> 25:16.681
The cold breath of winter
will freeze the seas...

25:16.765 --> 25:20.935
- Not now.
- ...and the dead shall rise in the North.

25:22.646 --> 25:26.274
All you men were named
in the light of the Seven!

25:26.358 --> 25:29.402
Is this how you treat the gods of your fathers?

25:29.486 --> 25:34.073
Are you so eager to spit on your ancestors?

25:42.750 --> 25:45.084
You smell of fear,

25:45.169 --> 25:49.130
fear and piss and old bones.

25:50.633 --> 25:52.217
Do you want to stop me?

25:56.847 --> 25:58.598
Stop me.

26:11.612 --> 26:13.279
In the ancient books, it's written

26:13.364 --> 26:17.075
that a warrior will draw
a burning sword from the fire.

26:18.327 --> 26:21.412
And that sword shall be Lightbringer.

26:26.335 --> 26:29.796
Stannis Baratheon,

26:29.880 --> 26:32.382
Warrior of Light,

26:32.466 --> 26:34.217
your sword awaits you.

27:05.207 --> 27:07.959
Lord, cast your light upon us!

27:09.670 --> 27:12.839
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

27:15.968 --> 27:19.095
For the night is dark and full of terror.

27:46.415 --> 27:50.001
This woman will lead him
into a war he cannot win.

27:50.085 --> 27:51.669
Stannis is our king.

27:51.754 --> 27:53.171
We follow where he leads,

27:53.255 --> 27:55.757
- even if we don't like the path.
- King.

27:55.841 --> 27:59.927
Since that boar killed his brother,
every lord wants a coronation.

28:00.012 --> 28:02.180
I don't serve the others. I serve Stannis.

28:02.264 --> 28:03.890
As do I,

28:03.974 --> 28:07.602
but loyal service means telling hard truths.

28:08.896 --> 28:11.689
He's surrounded by fools and fanatics,

28:12.983 --> 28:15.818
but he trusts you, Davos.

28:15.903 --> 28:18.488
If you tell him the truth...

28:20.282 --> 28:21.949
What's the truth?

28:34.922 --> 28:38.174
"And I declare upon the honor of
my house that my beloved brother Robert..."

28:38.258 --> 28:40.802
He wasn't my beloved brother.

28:40.969 --> 28:42.970
I didn't love him. He didn't love me.

28:43.055 --> 28:44.889
A harmless courtesy, Your Grace.

28:44.973 --> 28:46.015
A lie. Take it out.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.104
"That my brother Robert
left no trueborn heirs,

28:51.772 --> 28:55.775
"the boy Joffrey, the boy Tommen,
and the girl Myrcella being born of incest

28:55.859 --> 28:58.903
"between Cersei Lannister
and her brother Jaime Lannister.

28:58.987 --> 29:01.739
- "By right of birth..."
- Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.

29:01.824 --> 29:03.157
Call him what he is.

29:05.327 --> 29:07.662
"And her brother Jaime Lannister,
the Kingslayer."

29:07.746 --> 29:11.040
"By right of birth and blood,
I do this day lay claim..."

29:11.125 --> 29:14.001
Make it Ser Jaime Lannister,
the Kingslayer.

29:14.086 --> 29:16.129
Whatever else he is, the man's still a knight.

29:16.213 --> 29:18.548
"Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.

29:18.632 --> 29:20.842
"By right of birth and blood,

29:20.926 --> 29:23.970
"I do this day lay claim
to the Iron Throne of Westeros.

29:24.096 --> 29:26.681
"Let all true men declare their loyalty."

29:26.765 --> 29:29.058
When Eddard Stark learned
the truth, he told only me.

29:29.143 --> 29:31.352
I'll not make the same mistake.

29:31.437 --> 29:33.438
Send copies of that letter
to every corner of the realm,

29:33.522 --> 29:35.440
from the Arbor to the Wall.

29:35.524 --> 29:37.692
The time has come to choose.

29:38.485 --> 29:40.862
Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse.

29:40.946 --> 29:43.448
Your Grace, the Lannisters are
the true enemy.

29:43.532 --> 29:45.616
If, for the time being,
you could make peace with your brother...

29:45.701 --> 29:47.785
I'll not make peace
with Renly while he calls himself king.

29:47.870 --> 29:49.662
Well, many have already declared for him,

29:49.746 --> 29:51.956
Mace Tyrell, Randyll Tarly.

29:52.040 --> 29:55.251
Stannis does not need
to beg this lord or that lord for support.

29:55.335 --> 29:56.836
The Lord of Light stands behind him.

29:56.920 --> 30:00.173
And how many ships
has the Lord of Light got in his fleet?

30:00.257 --> 30:02.717
- He has no need for ships.
- I'm sure he doesn't,

30:02.801 --> 30:04.343
but we do if we're going to war.

30:04.887 --> 30:07.472
If not Renly, Your Grace,
join forces with Robb Stark.

30:07.556 --> 30:09.640
Who would steal
the northern half of my kingdom.

30:09.725 --> 30:13.144
I've always served thieves according
to their deserts, as you well know, Ser Davos.

30:13.228 --> 30:16.272
Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark, they're all thieves.

30:16.356 --> 30:18.774
They'll bend the knee or I'll destroy them.

30:19.610 --> 30:22.570
I owe you an apology, my king.

30:23.405 --> 30:25.364
My duty is to serve.

30:25.449 --> 30:29.577
You have chosen the new god
over the old gods.

30:29.661 --> 30:33.039
May the Lord of Light watch over us all.

30:33.123 --> 30:35.458
Shall we drink together?

30:35.542 --> 30:37.001
Don't.

30:37.544 --> 30:42.089
A cup of wine to honor the one true god.

31:28.470 --> 31:31.639
The night is dark and full of terrors, old man,

31:31.723 --> 31:34.809
but the fire burns them all away.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.846
King in the North.

32:14.600 --> 32:18.311
I keep expecting you to leave me
in one castle or another for safekeeping,

32:18.395 --> 32:21.272
but you drag me along from camp to camp.

32:22.899 --> 32:25.109
Have you grown fond of me, Stark?

32:25.193 --> 32:26.986
Is that it?

32:27.070 --> 32:28.863
I've never seen you with a girl.

32:29.990 --> 32:32.450
If I left you with one of my bannermen,

32:32.534 --> 32:35.536
your father would know within a fortnight

32:35.621 --> 32:39.165
and my bannerman would receive
a raven with a message,

32:39.249 --> 32:42.793
"Release my son
and you'll be rich beyond your dreams.

32:42.878 --> 32:46.297
"Refuse and your house
will be destroyed, root and stem."

32:46.381 --> 32:50.885
You don't trust the loyalty
of the men following you into battle?

32:50.969 --> 32:53.012
Oh, I trust them with my life,

32:54.431 --> 32:55.556
just not with yours.

32:56.350 --> 32:58.142
Smart boy.

32:58.393 --> 33:00.144
What's wrong?

33:00.228 --> 33:01.812
Don't like being called "boy"?

33:03.023 --> 33:04.732
Insulted?

33:12.032 --> 33:14.742
You insult yourself, Kingslayer.

33:16.745 --> 33:18.996
You've been defeated by a boy.

33:20.082 --> 33:22.208
You're held captive by a boy.

33:25.128 --> 33:26.921
Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy.

33:33.970 --> 33:37.556
Stannis Baratheon sent ravens
to all the high lords of Westeros.

33:39.142 --> 33:42.687
King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true king

33:42.771 --> 33:45.398
nor a true Baratheon.

33:45.982 --> 33:47.692
He's your bastard son.

33:47.776 --> 33:50.111
If that's true, Stannis is the rightful king.

33:50.195 --> 33:52.238
How convenient for him.

33:52.948 --> 33:56.575
My father learned the truth.

33:56.660 --> 33:58.285
That's why you had him executed.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.621
I was your prisoner
when Ned Stark lost his head.

34:00.706 --> 34:04.375
Your son killed him
so the world wouldn't learn who fathered him.

34:04.459 --> 34:05.710
And you,

34:06.920 --> 34:10.089
you pushed my brother from a window
because he saw you with the queen.

34:15.262 --> 34:17.304
You have proof?

34:18.639 --> 34:21.058
Or do you want to trade gossip
like a couple of fishwives?

34:21.143 --> 34:25.020
I'm sending one of your cousins down to
King's Landing with my peace terms.

34:25.105 --> 34:27.523
You think my father's going
to negotiate with you?

34:28.442 --> 34:30.443
You don't know him very well.

34:30.527 --> 34:34.112
No, but he's starting to know me.

34:35.157 --> 34:38.451
Three victories don't make you a conqueror.

34:39.828 --> 34:41.495
It's better than three defeats.

35:11.109 --> 35:12.818
This city stinks.

35:16.072 --> 35:17.656
Like dead bodies.

35:17.741 --> 35:19.825
A bit corpsey, yes.

35:20.702 --> 35:22.369
And shit.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.038
I thought you wanted to come here.

35:27.584 --> 35:29.084
I love it.

35:30.045 --> 35:33.047
You love the smell of dead bodies and shit?

35:33.799 --> 35:36.675
And cum and garlic and rum.

35:36.760 --> 35:39.261
You can smell cum from the balcony?

35:40.055 --> 35:43.307
I love the stink. I love the noise.

35:43.391 --> 35:45.392
Cities make me want to fuck.

35:46.394 --> 35:48.562
And so did the country.

35:51.817 --> 35:53.317
This is where I belong.

35:53.401 --> 35:56.195
Yes, well, you need to be careful.

35:56.279 --> 35:57.822
No one can know you're here.

35:57.906 --> 35:59.490
No one will know.

35:59.574 --> 36:01.283
You can't trust anyone in King's Landing.

36:01.368 --> 36:04.328
They're all liars, good liars, bad liars,

36:04.412 --> 36:06.831
one or two great liars.

36:06.915 --> 36:08.791
What about you?

36:08.875 --> 36:11.627
Me? I'm not from here. I'm a slave to the truth.

36:13.296 --> 36:14.380
Truth?

36:16.341 --> 36:19.343
You are the biggest little liar I have ever met.

36:19.427 --> 36:21.387
Why do you think I am so little?

36:21.471 --> 36:25.766
I'm being crushed beneath
the weight of all that truth.

36:30.230 --> 36:32.982
Ned Stark actually slept on this.

36:33.066 --> 36:36.694
As if the poor man didn't suffer enough.

36:38.613 --> 36:42.116
One of the many changes
we'll have to make around here.

36:53.295 --> 36:55.212
Lord Baelish.

36:55.297 --> 36:56.547
Your Grace.

36:56.631 --> 36:59.091
I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.

36:59.175 --> 37:00.718
Of course, Your Grace.

37:00.802 --> 37:02.720
Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya,

37:02.804 --> 37:04.972
we can't seem to locate her.

37:05.640 --> 37:09.602
If she's escaped the capital,
Winterfell seems the logical destination.

37:09.686 --> 37:12.104
And yet my friends in the North
report no sign of her.

37:12.188 --> 37:14.064
Curious.

37:14.149 --> 37:16.233
If we choose to negotiate with the Starks,

37:16.318 --> 37:18.319
the girl has some value. Whoever finds her...

37:18.403 --> 37:20.654
Well, you know what they say
about Lannisters and debts.

37:20.739 --> 37:23.115
Well, you could ask Varys where she is.

37:24.200 --> 37:25.451
He'll have an answer for you.

37:25.535 --> 37:26.952
Whether you believe it...

37:27.037 --> 37:31.040
Myself, I have always had
a hard time trusting eunuchs.

37:31.124 --> 37:33.584
Who knows what they want?

37:33.668 --> 37:35.586
A mockingbird.

37:36.880 --> 37:39.673
- You created your own sigil, didn't you?
- Yes.

37:40.467 --> 37:44.428
Appropriate, for a self-made man
with so many songs to sing.

37:44.512 --> 37:46.096
I'm glad you like it.

37:46.181 --> 37:49.642
Some people are fortunate enough
to be born into the right family.

37:49.726 --> 37:52.186
Others have to find their own way.

37:53.730 --> 37:55.773
I heard a song once

37:55.857 --> 37:58.442
about a boy of modest means

37:58.526 --> 38:01.028
who found his way into the home
of a very prominent family.

38:02.364 --> 38:03.989
He loved the eldest daughter.

38:04.074 --> 38:06.408
Sadly, she had eyes for another.

38:07.827 --> 38:11.747
When boys and girls live in the same home,
awkward situations can arise.

38:12.624 --> 38:17.127
Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers
and sisters develop certain affections.

38:17.796 --> 38:20.214
And when those affections
become common knowledge,

38:20.298 --> 38:24.134
well, that is an awkward situation indeed,

38:24.219 --> 38:26.345
especially in a prominent family.

38:26.429 --> 38:28.722
But prominent families
often forget a simple truth,

38:29.724 --> 38:31.183
I've found.

38:32.268 --> 38:34.269
And which truth is that?

38:34.354 --> 38:36.689
Knowledge is power.

38:40.235 --> 38:42.486
Seize him.

38:44.447 --> 38:46.240
Cut his throat.

38:46.908 --> 38:49.076
Stop. Wait.

38:50.078 --> 38:52.246
I've changed my mind. Let him go.

38:55.291 --> 38:56.917
Step back three paces.

38:58.503 --> 39:00.129
Turn around.

39:00.922 --> 39:02.339
Close your eyes.

39:06.720 --> 39:08.262
Power is power.

39:10.932 --> 39:14.685
Do see if you can take some time away
from your coins and your whores

39:14.769 --> 39:16.603
to locate the Stark girl for me.

39:16.688 --> 39:19.356
I would very much appreciate it.

39:30.076 --> 39:32.119
You're Ser Alton Lannister?

39:32.787 --> 39:34.788
I am, Your Grace.

39:34.873 --> 39:38.250
I offer your cousins peace
if they meet my terms.

39:38.376 --> 39:42.629
First, your family must release my sisters.

39:43.298 --> 39:46.258
Second, my father's bones
must be returned to us

39:46.342 --> 39:51.055
so he may rest beside his brother and sister
in the crypts beneath Winterfell.

39:51.139 --> 39:55.142
And the remains of all those who died
in his service must also be returned.

39:55.643 --> 39:58.103
Their families can honor them
with proper funerals.

39:58.188 --> 40:00.981
- An honorable request, Your Grace.
- Third...

40:02.817 --> 40:07.321
Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce
all claim to dominion of the North.

40:07.989 --> 40:12.659
From this time till the end of time,
we are a free and independent kingdom.

40:12.744 --> 40:14.745
The King in the North.

40:14.829 --> 40:17.247
- King in the North.
- King in the North.

40:17.332 --> 40:21.043
Neither Joffrey nor any of his men
shall set foot in our lands again.

40:21.127 --> 40:23.128
If he disregards this command,

40:23.213 --> 40:26.090
he shall suffer the same fate as my father,

40:26.674 --> 40:30.928
only I don't need a servant
to do my beheading for me.

40:31.012 --> 40:34.389
These are... Your Grace, these are...

40:34.474 --> 40:36.975
These are my terms.

40:37.060 --> 40:40.145
If the Queen Regent and her son meet them,
I'll give them peace.

40:40.230 --> 40:41.522
If not,

40:43.316 --> 40:45.776
I will litter the South with Lannister dead.

40:45.860 --> 40:48.570
King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace.

40:48.655 --> 40:50.197
Oh, is he?

40:51.658 --> 40:54.159
You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton.

40:55.036 --> 40:57.454
That will be all for tonight.

41:12.428 --> 41:14.429
A word, Your Grace?

41:16.349 --> 41:18.976
You don't have to call me "Your Grace"
when no one's around.

41:19.060 --> 41:21.687
It's not so bad once you get used to it.

41:21.813 --> 41:23.730
I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.

41:24.732 --> 41:26.900
The Lannisters are going
to reject your terms, you know?

41:26.985 --> 41:28.819
Of course they are.

41:28.903 --> 41:31.196
We can fight them
in the fields as long as you like,

41:31.281 --> 41:34.575
but we won't beat them
until you take King's Landing.

41:36.411 --> 41:39.621
And we can't take King's Landing
without ships.

41:39.706 --> 41:42.166
My father has ships
and men who know how to sail them.

41:42.250 --> 41:44.001
Men who fought my father.

41:44.085 --> 41:46.336
Men who fought King Robert
to free themselves

41:46.421 --> 41:50.090
from the yoke of the South,
just like you're doing now.

41:51.467 --> 41:53.427
I'm his only living son.

41:54.596 --> 41:57.556
He'll listen to me. I know he will.

42:00.101 --> 42:02.769
I'm not a Stark. I know that.

42:03.438 --> 42:06.273
But your father raised me
to be an honorable man.

42:08.276 --> 42:10.611
We can avenge him together.

42:12.739 --> 42:14.907
You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.

42:14.991 --> 42:17.284
I need his ships. They say he has 200.

42:17.368 --> 42:21.246
They say a million rats
live in the sewers of King's Landing.

42:21.331 --> 42:22.831
Shall we rally them to fight for us?

42:22.916 --> 42:24.791
I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.

42:24.876 --> 42:28.670
I don't trust Lord Greyjoy
because he is not trustworthy.

42:29.547 --> 42:32.049
Your father had to go to war
to end his rebellion.

42:32.133 --> 42:35.886
Yes. And now I'm the one
rebelling against the throne.

42:35.970 --> 42:38.222
Before me, it was Father.

42:38.306 --> 42:39.973
You married one rebel and mothered another.

42:40.433 --> 42:42.976
I mothered more than just rebels,

42:43.061 --> 42:45.270
a fact you seem to have forgotten.

42:45.355 --> 42:49.608
If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls,
my bannermen will string me up by my feet.

42:49.692 --> 42:52.903
You want to leave Sansa
in the queen's hands?

42:52.987 --> 42:54.988
And Arya...

42:55.073 --> 42:59.826
I haven't heard a word about Arya.
What are we fighting for, if not for them?

42:59.911 --> 43:03.455
It's more complicated than that!
You know it is.

43:18.096 --> 43:20.514
It's time for me to go home.

43:21.766 --> 43:24.518
I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.

43:25.520 --> 43:27.813
You can't go to Winterfell.

43:28.815 --> 43:30.148
I beg your pardon?

43:30.358 --> 43:33.610
I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys

43:33.695 --> 43:38.073
because tomorrow
you'll ride south to the Stormlands.

43:38.157 --> 43:40.158
Why in the name of all the gods...

43:40.243 --> 43:44.037
Because I need you
to negotiate with Renly Baratheon.

43:44.122 --> 43:46.206
He's rallied an army of 100,000.

43:46.291 --> 43:48.041
You know him. You know his family.

43:48.126 --> 43:50.502
I haven't seen Renly Baratheon
since he was a boy.

43:50.586 --> 43:51.878
You have a hundred other lords...

43:51.963 --> 43:54.965
Which of these lords
do I trust more than you?

43:55.883 --> 43:58.677
If Renly sides with us,

43:58.761 --> 44:01.263
we'll outnumber them two to one.

44:01.347 --> 44:04.141
When they feel the jaws beginning to shut,
they'll sue for peace.

44:04.225 --> 44:06.893
We'll get the girls back.

44:06.978 --> 44:09.896
Then we'll all go home, for good.

44:18.531 --> 44:20.282
I will ride at first light.

44:29.208 --> 44:32.294
We will all be together again soon, I promise.

44:37.842 --> 44:40.302
You've done so well.

44:41.763 --> 44:44.514
Your father would be proud.

44:53.608 --> 44:56.360
- Give Lord Renly my regards.
- King Renly.

44:57.653 --> 45:00.155
There's a king in every corner now.

45:13.419 --> 45:15.045
What is all this?

45:15.922 --> 45:18.215
Returning this room to its proper appearance.

45:18.299 --> 45:21.176
Say what you will about the Targaryens,
they were conquerors.

45:21.260 --> 45:23.887
That is a seat for a conqueror.

45:23.971 --> 45:27.557
It needs a room to match it,
not vines and flowers.

45:27.642 --> 45:30.060
We can't find Arya Stark.

45:30.144 --> 45:32.145
With luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere.

45:32.230 --> 45:34.272
Perhaps. But if not, we need her.

45:34.357 --> 45:36.608
They'll never give Jaime back
to us for Sansa alone.

45:36.692 --> 45:39.194
I think they might. They're weak.

45:39.278 --> 45:41.196
They put too much value on their women.

45:41.906 --> 45:44.908
We need to set our armies
to the task of finding her.

45:44.992 --> 45:46.952
Send out as many men as we can.

45:47.036 --> 45:48.912
I'm sure if you asked Grandfather...

45:48.996 --> 45:51.748
The king does not ask, he commands.

45:52.834 --> 45:55.627
And my grandfather's stupidity
in the field of battle

45:55.711 --> 45:58.547
is the reason Robb Stark
has Uncle Jaime in the first place.

45:58.631 --> 46:00.507
His life is in danger.

46:01.426 --> 46:03.051
We're at war.

46:03.136 --> 46:05.262
All our lives are in danger.

46:09.225 --> 46:11.935
I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime.

46:12.770 --> 46:14.020
And you.

46:15.398 --> 46:19.025
Our enemies will say anything
to weaken your claim to the throne.

46:19.110 --> 46:20.986
It's not a claim. The throne is mine.

46:22.738 --> 46:24.364
Of course it is.

46:26.409 --> 46:28.452
No one believes this foul gossip.

46:28.536 --> 46:30.537
Someone believes it.

46:32.081 --> 46:34.124
Father had other children?

46:34.625 --> 46:36.960
Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella?

46:39.380 --> 46:40.922
What are you asking?

46:41.299 --> 46:44.259
I'm asking if he fucked other women
when he grew tired of you.

46:44.343 --> 46:46.678
How many bastards does he have running...

47:02.612 --> 47:06.740
What you just did is punishable by death.

47:10.077 --> 47:12.329
You will never do it again.

47:12.997 --> 47:14.664
Never.

47:20.796 --> 47:22.797
That will be all, Mother.

47:29.680 --> 47:31.640
No, no, no, no.

47:31.724 --> 47:34.518
Do you have any idea
how ridiculous you sound?

47:34.602 --> 47:36.019
Ease into it.

47:36.103 --> 47:39.105
Slowly, with passion.

47:41.442 --> 47:42.776
Oh, yeah.

47:44.028 --> 47:46.780
Go wash yourselves. Put some clothes on.

47:46.864 --> 47:49.366
Both of you are working tonight.

47:53.287 --> 47:55.205
We do things differently here, Daisy.

47:55.289 --> 47:59.167
This isn't some five-copper
bawdy house in Hayseed Hall.

47:59.252 --> 48:01.836
- Haystack Hall.
- Wherever you're from.

48:01.921 --> 48:06.383
Our establishment doesn't cater
to plowmen and goat herders.

48:06.467 --> 48:08.218
Lord Olsen.

48:08.302 --> 48:10.220
Taste is everything here.

48:10.304 --> 48:12.222
Littlefinger's a fancy man.

48:12.306 --> 48:13.932
Don't call him Littlefinger.

48:14.016 --> 48:15.433
He doesn't like it.

48:15.518 --> 48:17.852
Lord Baelish.

48:23.693 --> 48:25.694
She pretends she doesn't
speak the common tongue

48:25.778 --> 48:28.363
so that people will think she's exotic.

48:28.447 --> 48:31.241
She grew up just down the road
in Flea Bottom.

48:31.325 --> 48:33.785
She's beautiful.

48:33.869 --> 48:37.163
She's a dumb slut, really,
but a lid for every pot.

48:42.253 --> 48:44.546
Lord Commander.

48:44.630 --> 48:47.465
Good to see you again.

49:02.481 --> 49:06.526
You do realize this establishment
is owned by Lord Petyr Baelish,

49:06.611 --> 49:08.778
the King's Master of Coin.

49:08.863 --> 49:10.697
Coin which goes in many pockets.

49:11.198 --> 49:13.408
- Orders.
- Whose orders?

49:13.492 --> 49:16.244
Someone who doesn't care
what Littlefinger thinks.

49:34.180 --> 49:37.140
No, you can't. No! Please!

49:37.933 --> 49:40.352
No! Not my Barra!

49:40.436 --> 49:43.855
- Please. Please.
- Enough. Get it done.

49:43.939 --> 49:45.815
- Kill the bastard.
- No, no!

49:45.900 --> 49:48.318
- Please.
- Give it here.

49:48.402 --> 49:50.570
No, please.

50:00.956 --> 50:03.249
Spread out. Search every house.

50:03.334 --> 50:05.585
Every room. Look in every room.

50:30.277 --> 50:32.696
Gendry! His name is Gendry.

50:32.780 --> 50:34.531
Where is the bastard?

50:34.615 --> 50:37.200
The Night's Watch! Please, stop!

50:37.284 --> 50:38.702
Where?

50:38.869 --> 50:41.705
They took him up the Kingsroad,
heading north.

50:41.789 --> 50:45.375
- How will we know him?
- He's got a bull's head helmet.

50:45.459 --> 50:48.294
- He made it himself.
- Find him.
