00:03.160 --> 00:04.799
KAT NARRATING: Previously
on "Dance Academy."

00:04.839 --> 00:08.279
-Don't let me stop you.

00:08.320 --> 00:09.400
-I'm Ethan.

00:09.439 --> 00:10.400
-Yeah, I know.

00:10.439 --> 00:11.919
We met.

00:11.960 --> 00:14.400
-Until I say otherwise, you're
to go back to basics and work

00:14.439 --> 00:15.599
at the bar.

00:22.760 --> 00:26.679
THEME SONG: Whoa-oh, oh, oh.

00:26.719 --> 00:30.239
Whoa-oh, oh.

00:30.280 --> 00:36.200
Take a breath, close
your eyes.

00:36.240 --> 00:42.600
Take a leap of faith and
lead the way tonight.

00:42.640 --> 00:46.200
This is my chance.

00:46.240 --> 00:48.600
This is my chance.

00:48.640 --> 00:51.600
My chance to feel alive.

00:51.640 --> 00:56.159
Whoa-oh, oh, oh.

00:56.200 --> 00:57.560
Whoa, oh, oh.

01:14.560 --> 01:17.200
TARA NARRATING: Back home, I'd
dance and instantly feel free.

01:21.640 --> 01:28.079
If I'd had a bad day at school
or a fight with a friend,

01:28.120 --> 01:31.719
dancing was the place
I'd escape to.

01:31.760 --> 01:33.640
[sirens ringing]

01:48.840 --> 01:50.319
-But here, it's like
everywhere I

01:50.359 --> 01:52.040
turn it's a dead end.

02:15.439 --> 02:20.360
[dog barking]

02:20.400 --> 02:21.800
-Get up.

02:21.840 --> 02:23.159
Get up.

02:27.360 --> 02:28.319
-Get up.

02:28.360 --> 02:28.759
Get up.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.159
Come on.

02:46.439 --> 02:48.479
TARA NARRATING: I'm still
dancing, but it's behind bars.

02:53.560 --> 02:55.439
I might as well be in a cage.

03:06.080 --> 03:07.280
Hey.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.800
They should just put you
out of your misery.

03:17.080 --> 03:18.400
OFFICER (OFFSCREEN): It's going
to be months before this

03:18.439 --> 03:20.800
matter goes before the court,
so until then you can be

03:20.840 --> 03:22.199
released to your parents.

03:26.639 --> 03:31.280
Look, Christian, I'm on your
side, but I need you

03:31.319 --> 03:32.159
to work with me.

03:32.199 --> 03:36.080
Can I have your mother's
number?

03:36.120 --> 03:37.319
-She's dead.

03:39.360 --> 03:42.319
-And your father?

03:42.360 --> 03:43.800
-Not applicable.

03:43.840 --> 03:45.199
OFFICER (OFFSCREEN): If there's
nobody who will take

03:45.240 --> 03:47.719
responsibility for you, you
could be in detention for

03:47.759 --> 03:50.800
months before you can be
placed in a refuge.

03:50.840 --> 03:53.560
-I've got a brother.

03:53.599 --> 03:54.360
-An adult?

03:54.400 --> 03:55.479
A responsible ad--

03:55.520 --> 03:56.639
-Yes, an adult.

03:56.680 --> 03:59.639
He's got a wife, a kid,
little picket fence.

03:59.680 --> 04:01.199
OFFICER (OFFSCREEN):
Does he work?

04:01.240 --> 04:02.479
-In the mines, Broken Hill.

04:08.520 --> 04:11.520
OFFICER (OFFSCREEN):
Give him a call.

04:11.560 --> 04:13.599
Will he vouch for you?

04:13.639 --> 04:14.719
-Of course you would.

04:14.759 --> 04:16.639
He's my brother.

04:16.680 --> 04:25.360
[phone ringing]

04:25.399 --> 04:28.279
[busy signal]

04:28.319 --> 04:29.560
-There's no answer.

04:32.319 --> 04:36.079
-Then you'll have to stay
in juvenile detention.

04:36.120 --> 04:37.759
Unless there's somebody
else you can call?

04:54.480 --> 04:56.199
-Most new students would
be excited to be at

04:56.240 --> 04:58.360
the National Academy.

04:58.399 --> 05:01.800
-It's probably not one of
their bail conditions.

05:01.839 --> 05:05.399
-It's a new situation
for both of us.

05:05.439 --> 05:08.399
-It's like roomie's coughing up
hairballs and stashing them

05:08.439 --> 05:10.319
in the bottom drawer.

05:10.360 --> 05:12.480
It smells so completely vile.

05:12.519 --> 05:14.720
I could actually just puke.

05:14.759 --> 05:15.560
Tara!

05:15.600 --> 05:16.079
-Sorry.

05:16.120 --> 05:17.199
Puked?

05:17.240 --> 05:18.079
-New roommate.

05:18.120 --> 05:19.360
She's holding something
morbid.

05:19.399 --> 05:21.639
I'm living in a fog of
revoltingness here.

05:21.680 --> 05:22.480
-See, Kat?

05:22.519 --> 05:23.160
Now you miss me.

05:23.199 --> 05:24.600
-I wish we were sharing.

05:24.639 --> 05:25.600
-You and me?

05:25.639 --> 05:27.560
Oh, Tara, I'm touched.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.639
-Wait, why don't you just get
Abigail to sign a room

05:29.680 --> 05:31.160
exchange form?

05:31.199 --> 05:33.199
I mean, she obviously doesn't
want to room with you, either.

05:33.240 --> 05:34.839
-Bet you $10 she says no.

05:34.879 --> 05:35.800
-Come on, Abigail.

05:35.839 --> 05:38.399
At least consider
swapping rooms.

05:38.439 --> 05:38.800
-OK.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.279
No.

05:41.319 --> 05:43.600
-Cough it up.

05:43.639 --> 05:46.319
Thank you.

05:46.360 --> 05:47.480
MISS RAINE (OFFSCREEN):
Firm fits.

06:07.839 --> 06:09.800
-Are you seriously pretending
I don't exist?

06:09.839 --> 06:12.360
I know you saw me
this morning.

06:12.399 --> 06:13.480
-What?

06:13.519 --> 06:15.639
Why, we didn't hook up
once or something?

06:15.680 --> 06:17.560
Because you're not
really my type.

06:17.600 --> 06:18.240
-No.

06:18.279 --> 06:19.480
Audition week, remember?

06:19.519 --> 06:21.439
You humiliated me because
I went to the

06:21.480 --> 06:24.480
wrong change rooms.

06:24.519 --> 06:27.319
-Oh, you're the little girl
in the training bra.

06:27.360 --> 06:29.759
High-pitched voice, having to
spy on guys in the bathroom.

06:29.800 --> 06:32.040
That's you, right?

06:32.079 --> 06:33.519
-That's me.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.079
Look around, we're in the same
class, which probably means

06:35.120 --> 06:36.560
we're the same age.

06:36.600 --> 06:37.759
Just because someone is on the
small size of average, it's

06:37.800 --> 06:39.439
not OK to make judgments
about their underwear.

06:39.480 --> 06:41.240
-Secondly, I've explained
to you much times

06:41.279 --> 06:42.439
that I wasn't spying.

06:42.480 --> 06:43.399
And even if I had been spying,
I wouldn't have

06:43.439 --> 06:44.560
been spying on you.

06:44.600 --> 06:45.720
And thirdly, my voice
isn't high-pitched!

06:45.759 --> 06:48.800
[laughter]

06:48.839 --> 06:52.240
-Yeah, it's all coming
back to me.

06:52.279 --> 06:55.199
-In my class, I expect
total concentration.

06:55.240 --> 06:56.360
-But, I-- it wasn't me.

06:56.399 --> 06:57.680
-Tara, I thought we understood
each other?

06:57.720 --> 06:58.759
-Yes, Miss Raine, we do.

06:58.800 --> 07:00.319
I've been working really hard.

07:00.360 --> 07:02.639
-Well, I can't see
any improvement.

07:02.680 --> 07:05.120
TARA (OFFSCREEN): You know, it's
possible I'm going to be

07:05.160 --> 07:07.160
off pointe and chained
to the bar forever.

07:07.199 --> 07:10.439
50,000 years from now, alien
will find my body and even

07:10.480 --> 07:12.319
they will know I'm a loser
of the academy.

07:12.360 --> 07:13.680
-Ah, but they'll also
be impressed with

07:13.720 --> 07:15.319
your lack of bunions.

07:15.360 --> 07:16.199
ETHAN (OFFSCREEN): I'm sorry.

07:16.240 --> 07:17.319
-You can't be serious.

07:17.360 --> 07:18.800
You're not actually breaking
up with me.

07:18.839 --> 07:20.720
-It's not you, it's me, OK?

07:20.759 --> 07:22.160
It doesn't feel right.

07:22.199 --> 07:22.920
-Yeah?

07:22.959 --> 07:24.160
Well, how does this feel?

07:30.519 --> 07:31.240
-What is with your brother?

07:31.279 --> 07:33.560
Why does he do this?

07:33.600 --> 07:34.839
-You knew the ground rules.

07:34.879 --> 07:37.800
Don't dump your toxic
waste on me.

07:37.839 --> 07:39.240
-You'd tell me if he
liked someone else

07:39.279 --> 07:40.439
though, wouldn't you?

07:46.639 --> 07:47.319
Please, Kat.

07:47.360 --> 07:48.279
I need to know.

07:48.319 --> 07:49.240
You need to speak
to him for me.

07:49.279 --> 07:50.720
-Three words, Isabelle.

07:50.759 --> 07:52.000
Told you so.

07:52.040 --> 07:55.800
-You Karamakovs are a chip
off the same iceberg.

07:55.839 --> 07:57.720
-I need to go eat my feelings.

08:10.800 --> 08:12.560
-What was that?

08:12.600 --> 08:13.759
-What?

08:16.319 --> 08:18.360
-You like him.

08:18.399 --> 08:21.279
-No, I don't.

08:21.319 --> 08:24.199
-Tara, you can't go there.

08:24.240 --> 08:25.480
-Why not?

08:25.519 --> 08:26.639
-Did you not see
Kat regurgitate

08:26.680 --> 08:27.800
Isabelle just then?

08:27.839 --> 08:30.600
-It would be different
if it was me.

08:30.639 --> 08:31.600
-You're deluded.

08:31.639 --> 08:32.799
-We'd be like sisters.

08:35.360 --> 08:36.120
-Come on.

08:36.159 --> 08:37.320
When Mia went on exchange--

08:37.360 --> 08:39.480
-Ah, this is Mia, you're
imaginary girlfriend?

08:39.519 --> 08:43.399
-When Mia went on exchange, we
wrote up a pros and cons list

08:43.440 --> 08:46.279
and it-- it helped clarify
our feelings.

08:46.320 --> 08:49.639
So Ethan Karamakov.

08:49.679 --> 08:53.600
All right, so I'm going
to start with cons.

08:53.639 --> 08:54.600
Kat.

08:54.639 --> 08:56.679
-I really don't think
she'd mind.

08:56.720 --> 08:59.480
-Because she didn't mind
with Isabelle?

08:59.519 --> 09:01.639
All right, what else?

09:01.679 --> 09:03.600
-Well, I guess it's
distracting.

09:03.639 --> 09:05.360
I should be concentrating
on dancing.

09:05.399 --> 09:08.480
-I'm going to put that first
where it belongs.

09:08.519 --> 09:09.759
What else?

09:09.799 --> 09:11.399
-The first time I spoke to
him, I was so nervous.

09:11.440 --> 09:15.600
I swear a little bit of vomit
came up in my mouth.

09:15.639 --> 09:16.720
-Gross.

09:16.759 --> 09:18.759
-He also changes the
way my heart beats.

09:18.799 --> 09:21.320
-OK, well, that could be
common arrhythmia.

09:21.360 --> 09:22.399
-When he's walking--

09:22.440 --> 09:23.919
SAM (OFFSCREEN): Yeah?

09:23.960 --> 09:27.320
-He never looks back, like he
knows exactly where he's going

09:27.360 --> 09:30.799
and that everybody else
is following.

09:30.840 --> 09:32.200
-Wow.

09:43.759 --> 09:45.159
-What?

09:45.200 --> 09:47.600
-Ah, I just thought I'd come by
and see if we could brush

09:47.639 --> 09:48.799
each other's hair.

09:48.840 --> 09:50.600
-Tara's not here.

09:50.639 --> 09:53.519
-Why are you doing this?

09:53.559 --> 09:55.600
-Look, Tara doesn't want
to room with you, so

09:55.639 --> 09:57.320
just sign the form.

09:57.360 --> 10:00.200
-Has it ever occurred to you
that the reason I won't change

10:00.240 --> 10:02.080
rooms is because
you want me to?

10:08.120 --> 10:10.840
-And he smells like Christmas.

10:10.879 --> 10:12.799
-OK, I swear a little
bit of vomit just

10:12.840 --> 10:14.399
came up in my mouth.

10:14.440 --> 10:15.399
That's going down as a con.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.759
-It's a pro.

10:16.799 --> 10:17.559
KAT (OFFSCREEN): You guys,
I've been looking for you

10:17.600 --> 10:18.879
everywhere.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.440
-That is not the face of someone
that could hate me.

10:20.480 --> 10:22.200
-The natives are getting
restless.

10:22.240 --> 10:22.840
-What's up?

10:22.879 --> 10:24.360
-Abigail.

10:24.399 --> 10:26.480
The details are unimportant.

10:26.519 --> 10:27.720
This means war.

10:34.320 --> 10:34.960
TARA (OFFSCREEN): Oh, hey.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.440
I hope you don't mind.

10:36.480 --> 10:39.080
I've been feeling a little
homesick, so since I'm saying,

10:39.120 --> 10:40.279
I decided to redecorate.

10:45.559 --> 10:46.759
-Ow.

10:56.840 --> 10:59.440
-I'm impressed.

10:59.480 --> 11:00.600
KAT (OFFSCREEN): Maybe
we need to crank the

11:00.639 --> 11:02.240
sabotage up a notch.

11:02.279 --> 11:04.159
Find a weakness and target it.

11:04.200 --> 11:06.080
Really hit her where it hurts.

11:13.799 --> 11:17.360
-Tara, you probably shouldn't
use that.

11:17.399 --> 11:19.639
Seeing as you felt comfortable
enough to use my toiletries, I

11:19.679 --> 11:21.320
didn't think you'd mind
if I used that

11:21.360 --> 11:22.480
brush to clean my toenails.

11:25.080 --> 11:27.039
They came out really well.

11:34.080 --> 11:35.240
-She's good.

11:41.080 --> 11:41.799
-OK, that's it, everyone.

11:41.840 --> 11:43.240
I'll see you tomorrow.

11:43.279 --> 11:44.600
Christian, nice jumps.

11:44.639 --> 11:45.519
Stick around.

11:45.559 --> 11:46.399
I'll run you through
the beats.

11:53.600 --> 11:56.159
-Come on, T. You'll
be all right.

12:00.559 --> 12:03.519
OK, so no bombing, no posing,
no sashaying.

12:03.559 --> 12:05.080
And avoid the high tide.

12:05.120 --> 12:06.799
So we bury the bodies
of those who give

12:06.840 --> 12:10.279
away the secret location.

12:10.320 --> 12:12.799
-See, she's bringing us
to her getaway place.

12:12.840 --> 12:15.360
I bet she never brought
Isabelle here.

12:15.399 --> 12:16.679
-You're going down in flames.

12:16.720 --> 12:19.200
-So Kat.

12:19.240 --> 12:21.480
This morning with Isabelle,
did you not like her?

12:21.519 --> 12:23.279
-No, she's great.

12:23.320 --> 12:24.840
We used to be like that.

12:24.879 --> 12:27.440
-But Ethan was the
deal breaker?

12:27.480 --> 12:30.159
-Practically every friend I've
ever had has fallen for him.

12:30.200 --> 12:31.480
It's pathetic, right?

12:31.519 --> 12:33.399
You know what really
annoys me?

12:33.440 --> 12:34.919
All on about him.

12:34.960 --> 12:36.799
I tell them he's going to be a
regular prince charming until

12:36.840 --> 12:39.600
he gets bored, and then
he dumps them.

12:39.639 --> 12:40.840
So what do they do?

12:40.879 --> 12:43.600
They do it anyway.

12:43.639 --> 12:45.720
And I'm expected to open
my arms and let them

12:45.759 --> 12:47.039
snot all over me?

12:47.080 --> 12:48.279
No thanks.

12:58.840 --> 13:01.799
Coming in?

13:01.840 --> 13:03.360
-Kat?

13:03.399 --> 13:04.600
-Yeah?

13:07.840 --> 13:09.159
Karaoke.

13:10.799 --> 13:11.399
-Karaoke?

13:11.440 --> 13:12.480
I hate karaoke.

13:15.360 --> 13:17.080
-Exactly my point.

13:17.120 --> 13:18.279
Everyone hates karaoke.

13:18.320 --> 13:21.200
Therefore, Abigail
hates karaoke.

13:21.240 --> 13:26.159
-Ah, you, my friend,
are a genius.

13:26.200 --> 13:28.559
Karaoke in your dorm room would
be perfect torture.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.759
Man, I'm so glad she's
on my side.

13:50.480 --> 13:55.159
-Ethan, I want to introduce
Christian.

13:55.200 --> 13:56.720
He's just joined us.

13:56.759 --> 13:58.519
-Hey.

13:58.559 --> 14:02.399
-I'd like him to look to you
as a mentor of sorts.

14:02.440 --> 14:04.200
Ethan's in third year.

14:04.240 --> 14:05.840
I'm sure he'll be happy to
answer any questions.

14:12.440 --> 14:16.200
-So what do you want to know?

14:16.240 --> 14:17.600
-Nothing.

14:17.639 --> 14:20.120
-Look, let's just forget
the whole mentor thing.

14:20.159 --> 14:22.320
Let's just call it
mates, yeah?

14:22.360 --> 14:25.399
-I've already got mates.

14:25.440 --> 14:26.600
-Ethan, can I speak
to you, please?

14:30.360 --> 14:31.519
-[sigh].

14:37.279 --> 14:39.200
What's up?

14:39.240 --> 14:41.200
-None of this makes any sense.

14:41.240 --> 14:46.159
I need to know what I've done
to you that was so wrong.

14:46.200 --> 14:51.080
ETHAN (OFFSCREEN): Isabelle,
honest to god [inaudible].

14:51.120 --> 14:53.120
This just doesn't feel right.

14:53.159 --> 14:54.240
-Well, what doesn't
feel right?

14:54.279 --> 14:56.720
Which part exactly?

14:56.759 --> 14:58.240
-Can you give me a sec?

15:03.159 --> 15:06.480
This is going to take longer
than I thought.

15:06.519 --> 15:07.639
Sorry.

15:14.399 --> 15:16.840
-(SINGING) There's a
thing that I ain't

15:16.879 --> 15:19.639
never going to say.

15:19.679 --> 15:21.159
-How's that, Kat?

15:21.200 --> 15:27.399
-(SINGING) No way we'll
see the light of day.

15:27.440 --> 15:33.519
Because when I think of all
the things I want to do, I

15:33.559 --> 15:40.799
don't know if you think
they would be cool.

15:40.840 --> 15:44.799
And when I think of all the
things I want to say.

15:44.840 --> 15:46.360
Here's the beat.

15:46.399 --> 15:47.600
-Whoa, oh, oh.

15:47.639 --> 15:49.360
-Sing with me, Abigail.

15:49.399 --> 15:50.399
-No thanks.

15:50.440 --> 15:52.799
-(SINGING) I just don't
know what to do.

15:52.840 --> 15:55.320
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

16:27.639 --> 16:28.600
-Oh, sorry.

16:28.639 --> 16:32.159
I'm just looking
for my wallet.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.279
Hey, you OK?

16:34.320 --> 16:34.759
-Yeah.

16:34.799 --> 16:36.080
Oh, um, no.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.639
Well, sort of, yeah.

16:37.679 --> 16:39.360
Yeah.

16:39.399 --> 16:41.399
I mean, I'd be better if Miss
Raine would get off my back.

16:41.440 --> 16:44.159
But apart from that,
I'm just--

16:44.200 --> 16:46.559
I'm terrified that I'm never
going to be good enough, no

16:46.600 --> 16:49.159
matter how hard I'm trying.

16:49.200 --> 16:53.120
And my roommate is giving
my absolute hell.

16:53.159 --> 16:54.399
I just--

16:54.440 --> 16:55.440
sorry.

16:55.480 --> 16:56.639
I'm fine.

17:01.679 --> 17:02.799
-It's OK.

17:02.840 --> 17:05.680
Everybody goes through this.

17:05.720 --> 17:07.079
Here.

17:12.640 --> 17:13.640
I've got a spare moment.

17:13.680 --> 17:15.319
I'll take you through
your developpes.

17:15.358 --> 17:16.279
-Really?

17:16.319 --> 17:18.358
I mean, as long as
you don't mind.

17:36.519 --> 17:38.839
-She's on the move.

17:38.880 --> 17:41.119
-Taking your time?

17:41.160 --> 17:43.079
You, of all people, can't
afford to be late.

17:43.119 --> 17:44.400
-I better get a move on then.

17:48.839 --> 17:52.400
[door closing]

17:52.440 --> 17:53.359
-Hey.

17:53.400 --> 17:54.799
What do you think
you're doing?

17:54.839 --> 17:56.799
KAT (OFFSCREEN): Abigail,
is that you in there?

17:56.839 --> 17:57.400
-Yes.

17:57.440 --> 17:58.759
Open the door.

17:58.799 --> 18:00.640
-It's not like you to be late
for Miss Raine's class.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.480
ABIGAIL (OFFSCREEN): I'm
not kidding, Kat.

18:02.519 --> 18:03.640
Open the door.

18:03.680 --> 18:05.000
KAT (OFFSCREEN): Oh,
don't worry.

18:05.039 --> 18:07.400
I'm willing to unlock this door
and help you maintain

18:07.440 --> 18:09.440
your sickeningly perfect
attendance record.

18:09.480 --> 18:13.400
All you have to do is sign
on the dotted line.

18:13.440 --> 18:14.640
-Not in this lifetime.

18:19.279 --> 18:21.519
Open the door!

18:21.559 --> 18:23.799
-I had a long talk
with your lawyer.

18:23.839 --> 18:27.640
She believes that your only
chance is to show the court

18:27.680 --> 18:29.759
that you've turned
your life around.

18:29.799 --> 18:31.200
-Yeah, I know.

18:31.240 --> 18:34.319
Something about an
apprenticeship or something.

18:34.359 --> 18:40.160
-What she told me was "Proven
commitment to training for an

18:40.200 --> 18:43.119
elite career in dance would be
compelling evidence that

18:43.160 --> 18:48.400
Christian would benefit from a
non-custodial sentence." This

18:48.440 --> 18:50.799
could be your ticket
to freedom.

18:50.839 --> 18:51.839
-Yeah.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.319
Well, this is my ticket
to Broken Hill.

18:55.839 --> 18:58.240
-So you got through to
your brother then?

18:58.279 --> 18:59.559
-Look, I've run out of
credit, all right?

18:59.599 --> 19:01.480
He'll get my missed calls
and he'll call me back.

19:04.400 --> 19:05.759
-Here.

19:05.799 --> 19:07.400
Go ahead.

19:07.440 --> 19:10.279
-No, he probably won't answer
a number he doesn't know.

19:10.319 --> 19:12.200
-It's worth a shot
though, right?

19:26.680 --> 19:27.279
-Drew.

19:27.319 --> 19:29.400
Hey, it's me.

19:29.440 --> 19:30.079
Yeah, no.

19:30.119 --> 19:31.759
No, Christian.

19:31.799 --> 19:32.519
Yeah, look.

19:32.559 --> 19:33.440
I'm--

19:33.480 --> 19:36.519
I'm coming to stay
for a while.

19:36.559 --> 19:37.480
Yeah.

19:37.519 --> 19:39.720
No, I won't cause any trouble.

19:43.839 --> 19:45.200
Yeah, well, I'm great
with kids.

19:48.160 --> 19:49.319
Well, I'll learn.

19:52.200 --> 19:53.319
Yeah, but--

19:56.519 --> 19:57.799
it wouldn't be forever.

20:03.640 --> 20:04.279
Yeah.

20:04.319 --> 20:05.440
No, it's all good.

20:05.480 --> 20:06.400
All right.

20:06.440 --> 20:07.640
Bye.

20:29.200 --> 20:29.759
-Hey!

20:29.799 --> 20:32.480
-What do you want?

20:32.519 --> 20:33.799
-My wallet.

20:33.839 --> 20:35.799
-What are you talking about?

20:35.839 --> 20:38.079
I wouldn't do that again
if I were you.

20:38.119 --> 20:39.039
-Oh, yeah?

20:39.079 --> 20:39.680
Whoa.

20:39.720 --> 20:41.039
Hey, settle down.

20:43.759 --> 20:45.039
Want my advice, Christian?

20:45.079 --> 20:46.400
-You're never going to fit in.

20:46.440 --> 20:47.799
It's clear you don't
want to be here.

20:47.839 --> 20:50.200
So why don't you just crawl back
to whatever rat hole you

20:50.240 --> 20:51.119
came out of?

20:51.160 --> 20:52.480
Then everyone's happy.

20:55.839 --> 20:57.480
-There's some cash missing.

20:57.519 --> 20:58.240
I can give it back--

20:58.279 --> 21:01.160
-I don't want your money.

21:01.200 --> 21:02.319
But you owe me.

21:10.079 --> 21:11.240
ABIGAIL (OFFSCREEN):
Let me out.

21:13.839 --> 21:19.200
S-O-S. Ethan?

21:29.519 --> 21:30.279
-No, Kat.

21:30.319 --> 21:31.079
I can't do it.

21:31.119 --> 21:33.160
I can't stoop to her level.

21:33.200 --> 21:34.000
-Relax.

21:34.039 --> 21:35.599
I'll stoop for the both of us.

21:35.640 --> 21:36.319
-Nope.

21:36.359 --> 21:37.839
Got to let her out.

21:37.880 --> 21:40.039
-On a meanness scale
of one to Abigail,

21:40.079 --> 21:42.480
you're not even a seven.

21:42.519 --> 21:43.839
I hope you know you're no fun.

22:00.400 --> 22:03.519
-I'm really sorry, Abigail.

22:03.559 --> 22:04.720
