00:24.840 --> 00:26.760
<i>Why is it that the more you have to say,</i>

00:26.840 --> 00:28.360
<i>the harder it is to speak?</i>

00:30.360 --> 00:31.840
You should take a shower.

00:34.360 --> 00:35.360
Yeah.

00:37.400 --> 00:39.360
<i>My heart's beating in my face.</i>

00:44.360 --> 00:45.360
Here you go.

00:46.440 --> 00:48.320
- Thanks.
- Who is he?

00:49.120 --> 00:50.600
That's James.

00:51.640 --> 00:52.640
Oh, wow.

00:57.280 --> 00:58.520
I'm gonna finish cashing up.

01:09.560 --> 01:11.200
Have you been following me?

01:11.280 --> 01:12.280
Yes.

01:16.600 --> 01:17.840
Did you get one of these?

01:19.280 --> 01:20.280
<i>Shit.</i>

01:21.120 --> 01:22.840
Is that what you came here to tell me?

01:23.600 --> 01:25.040
I... Yeah.

01:25.800 --> 01:26.800
That's it?

01:27.440 --> 01:29.280
Well, don't you think it's a bit sinister?

01:29.360 --> 01:30.360
Not really.

01:30.760 --> 01:32.880
It's probably some dickhead
we went to school with.

01:35.160 --> 01:37.000
You shouldn't have come here, James.

01:40.920 --> 01:42.440
<i>He looks old.</i>

01:49.480 --> 01:50.880
What's wrong with your leg?

01:52.120 --> 01:53.120
Nothing.

01:54.040 --> 01:55.280
It's just a bit stiff.

01:55.920 --> 01:56.960
Right.

01:58.640 --> 01:59.640
My dad's dead.

02:03.280 --> 02:04.280
Shit.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Sorry.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.800
- I'm getting married tomorrow.
- I know.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.160
Congratulations.

02:22.840 --> 02:24.960
<i>Is it bad that it's nice to see him?</i>

02:28.840 --> 02:30.520
Yeah, you can't drive that.

02:30.600 --> 02:32.320
I'll get Eric to sort you out tomorrow.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.320
Thanks.

02:34.680 --> 02:36.760
Where are you staying?
We'll give you a lift.

02:37.440 --> 02:38.640
Oh, no. It's fine.

02:39.560 --> 02:40.760
I can walk.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.600
Are you living in your car?

02:46.320 --> 02:47.320
Yeah.

02:48.440 --> 02:50.040
You can stay in the cabin.

02:58.360 --> 02:59.600
Toilet's through there.

03:00.480 --> 03:01.480
Is there a shower?

03:01.840 --> 03:02.920
There's a lake.

03:03.720 --> 03:04.720
Thank you.

03:07.920 --> 03:10.200
Eric says he'll drop your car off
tomorrow afternoon.

03:11.120 --> 03:12.440
Is there a cash machine nearby?

03:13.160 --> 03:14.280
Don't worry about it.

03:16.320 --> 03:17.320
I'll be outside.

03:24.400 --> 03:27.200
I'd invite you to the wedding,
but that'd probably be a bit weird.

03:29.080 --> 03:30.080
Yeah.

03:31.120 --> 03:32.120
Bye.

03:33.120 --> 03:34.120
Bye.

03:39.040 --> 03:40.040
James?

03:41.320 --> 03:42.320
Yeah?

03:43.080 --> 03:44.080
Tomorrow...

03:44.920 --> 03:47.640
when the car's fixed,
you will leave, won't you?

03:49.280 --> 03:51.240
Uh... Yeah.

03:52.720 --> 03:54.080
You shouldn't have come here.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.480
I'm sorry.

03:59.360 --> 04:00.960
I'm sorry about your dad.

10:07.520 --> 10:09.280
I don't know.
I just wanted to leave.

10:10.040 --> 10:10.880
What happened?

10:10.960 --> 10:12.040
Look, can we not?

10:12.560 --> 10:14.080
I don't want to talk about it, okay?

10:15.120 --> 10:17.360

10:17.440 --> 10:18.640

10:25.800 --> 10:27.560
or just carry him around like a mascot?

10:28.360 --> 10:29.480
I'm gonna scatter him.

10:30.600 --> 10:31.680
Where?

10:32.120 --> 10:33.280
<i>I had no idea.</i>

10:34.560 --> 10:35.560
It's private.

10:40.440 --> 10:41.440
Are you cold?

10:41.760 --> 10:42.760
No.

10:43.600 --> 10:44.800
Are you hungry?

10:45.280 --> 10:46.360
Not really.

10:48.800 --> 10:49.800
I am.

10:51.720 --> 10:52.720
Fine.

11:11.840 --> 11:13.080
Congratulations.

11:13.600 --> 11:15.600
- What?
- Happy wedding.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
We're not married.

11:18.040 --> 11:20.760
- What?
- We've actually been to a funeral.

11:21.360 --> 11:22.360
Oh?

11:24.960 --> 11:25.960
Sorry.

11:26.360 --> 11:28.800
I just thought
I'd get a bit more wear out of this.

11:29.400 --> 11:30.400
Right.

11:30.800 --> 11:32.920
I'll give you a couple minutes.

11:42.360 --> 11:43.720
<i>Alyssa was different.</i>

11:44.320 --> 11:46.120
<i>What the fuck am I doing here?</i>

11:47.200 --> 11:49.360
<i>It was like someone had taken
her batteries out.</i>

11:49.880 --> 11:50.880
Alyssa?

11:52.200 --> 11:53.200
Yeah.

11:53.960 --> 11:55.160
The letter I sent you...

11:56.760 --> 11:57.920
I'm sorry.

11:59.760 --> 12:00.760
What letter?

12:01.240 --> 12:03.560
<i>When I realised she might not have got it,</i>

12:03.640 --> 12:05.680
<i>it felt like a weight
had been lifted from my chest.</i>

12:06.440 --> 12:08.440
Oh, yeah. That.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.880
<i>Which seemed much heavier
when it was put back.</i>

12:12.200 --> 12:13.920
I'm really, really sorry.

12:14.840 --> 12:16.040
It was ages ago.

12:16.640 --> 12:18.400
I can't even remember what it said.

12:19.520 --> 12:20.680
<i>"Dear Alyssa,</i>

12:21.160 --> 12:23.520
<i>I don't want to see you again. Ever.</i>

12:24.640 --> 12:26.920
<i>Because of you, I killed someone.</i>

12:27.480 --> 12:30.280
<i>I can't ever take that back,
and it's made me hate you.</i>

12:31.120 --> 12:32.720
<i>So whatever you feel about me,</i>

12:32.800 --> 12:35.360
<i>you should know I don't feel it in return.</i>

12:35.440 --> 12:37.000
<i>Please leave me alone.</i>

12:37.080 --> 12:39.560
<i>Sincerely, James.</i><i>P.S...."</i>

12:40.600 --> 12:42.040
Good luck with everything.

12:43.160 --> 12:44.160
Yeah.

12:44.920 --> 12:46.800
Do you maybe want to take that out?

12:47.560 --> 12:48.560
No.

12:50.760 --> 12:53.160
<i>"Because of you, I killed someone."</i>

12:56.680 --> 12:59.760
<i>"I can't ever take that back,
and it's made me hate you."</i>

13:01.000 --> 13:02.160
I'm sorry.

13:02.640 --> 13:04.600
It's fine. Shut up.

13:09.360 --> 13:10.480
Should we go?

13:11.840 --> 13:12.840
We need to pay.

13:14.200 --> 13:15.200
I know.

13:15.680 --> 13:16.880
Shall we still go?

13:19.240 --> 13:20.520
You know, if you do a runner,

13:20.640 --> 13:23.400
the waiter or waitress
usually has to pay out of their tips?

13:23.800 --> 13:26.200
Uh, no, I didn't know that.

13:26.280 --> 13:29.520
Yeah, that's true.
We're held responsible.

13:30.440 --> 13:31.440
Right.

13:32.680 --> 13:33.680
Okay.

13:35.880 --> 13:37.320
Were you not gonna pay?

13:37.920 --> 13:41.600
Uh... No, of course we were.

13:42.760 --> 13:43.760
Keep the change.

13:51.920 --> 13:52.920
Alyssa?

13:55.200 --> 13:56.200
Alyssa?

13:58.360 --> 14:00.080
- Alyssa?
- What?

14:02.280 --> 14:03.400
<i>I just had to say it.</i>

14:03.960 --> 14:05.720
<i>There would never be a right time.</i>

14:06.240 --> 14:07.240
What?

14:07.920 --> 14:09.040
<i>I love you.</i>

14:09.480 --> 14:11.080
<i>I don't want to be here.</i>

14:11.920 --> 14:12.920
<i>I love you.</i>

14:13.440 --> 14:14.960
<i>I don't want to be anywhere.</i>

14:15.800 --> 14:17.000
<i>I love you.</i>

14:18.120 --> 14:20.160
I think we should go back.
This is stupid.

14:20.840 --> 14:21.960
Wait. What?

14:22.400 --> 14:24.400
What are we doing, James?
Where are we even going?

14:24.480 --> 14:26.720
- I don't know. You came to me.
- I didn't come to you.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.440
You came to me.
You were stalking me.

14:28.520 --> 14:30.440
I was not stalking you,
I was watching you.

14:30.520 --> 14:31.800
That's still weird.

14:31.880 --> 14:33.760
But you said you wanted to leave.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.800
Well, now I want to go back.

14:35.880 --> 14:36.920
Why?

14:37.000 --> 14:38.880
Because I am married.

14:40.160 --> 14:42.480
What? You did it?

14:45.120 --> 14:46.120
I do.

14:46.480 --> 14:47.480
Yes!

14:48.840 --> 14:51.640
- Alyssa, wait!
- Oh, for fuck's sake!

14:51.720 --> 14:52.720
No!

14:53.760 --> 14:54.640
Hey!

14:54.720 --> 14:56.040
Stop!

14:56.120 --> 14:57.640
- Hey!
- Stop!

14:59.280 --> 15:00.280
Brilliant!

15:00.720 --> 15:01.760
Oh, no.

15:01.840 --> 15:02.840
Oh, no.

15:02.920 --> 15:05.400
I know it was your home or whatever,
but you don't need to cry.

15:05.480 --> 15:08.040
It's just been towed.
What's wrong with you?

15:08.720 --> 15:09.720
It's my dad.

15:10.800 --> 15:11.800
Oh, yeah.

15:12.600 --> 15:13.600
Shit.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.360
I am actually a bit cold now.

15:24.440 --> 15:25.440
Thanks.

15:29.360 --> 15:31.080
What if they got rid of him?

15:32.240 --> 15:33.240
Come on.

15:41.920 --> 15:43.480
Four hundred plus VAT.

15:44.000 --> 15:44.840
What?

15:44.920 --> 15:46.240
Shouldn't have parked it there.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.256
I don't understand,
there wasn't a sign or anything.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.640
- Yeah, there would have been a sign.
- There wasn't a sign.

15:50.720 --> 15:51.920
There's always a sign.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.440
There fucking wasn't.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.000
Maybe you need glasses.

15:55.080 --> 15:56.680
Maybe you need a better job.

15:59.360 --> 16:00.600
I'm sorry.

16:01.240 --> 16:03.720
Look, we just got married.

16:04.560 --> 16:07.440
We're saving up for our honeymoon.
We don't have a lot of money.

16:07.520 --> 16:09.480
Can you let it go just this one time?

16:13.440 --> 16:14.640
It's cash only.

16:14.720 --> 16:16.160
Please, can I just get my dad?

16:16.640 --> 16:18.720
- What?
- He's dead. He's in the car.

16:19.400 --> 16:22.840
I don't mean his body, his ashes.
His ashes are in the car.

16:24.040 --> 16:26.480
Look, we'll come back with the money,
I promise, but for now,

16:26.560 --> 16:27.560
can I just get him?

16:28.040 --> 16:29.080
He's in the car?

16:30.440 --> 16:32.200
- Yeah.
- So he's safe.

16:35.520 --> 16:38.120
- Well, yeah.
- So when you come back with the money,

16:39.000 --> 16:40.360
- he'll be there.
- No.

16:40.440 --> 16:42.440
You don't understand.

16:42.520 --> 16:44.520
- Please.
- James. It's cool.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.880
We'll come back.
What time do you close?

16:46.960 --> 16:48.480
- Five.
- Okay.

16:49.280 --> 16:50.480
Come on.

16:55.560 --> 16:57.360
I don't have 400 plus VAT.

16:57.440 --> 16:59.440
- Neither do I.
- Then what are we going to do?

17:00.000 --> 17:01.640
We're going to wait till five o'clock.

17:15.520 --> 17:17.200
How did he die, your dad?

17:18.520 --> 17:19.520
Heart attack.

17:20.600 --> 17:22.120
Bad diet, no exercise.

17:23.240 --> 17:24.240
Shit.

17:25.120 --> 17:26.600
It's probably how I'll go.

17:29.040 --> 17:30.360
Why did you get married?

17:31.120 --> 17:32.360
Because I wanted to.

17:33.800 --> 17:34.800
Okay.

17:35.160 --> 17:37.040
<i>Because I thought I wanted to.</i>

17:38.040 --> 17:39.640
<i>Because I had to do something...</i>

17:41.560 --> 17:43.000
<i>so I did that.</i>

17:43.920 --> 17:45.360
Wake me up when it's time.

17:48.080 --> 17:49.080
Okay.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.960
<i>On paper,
things looked quite bleak for me.</i>

18:00.360 --> 18:02.840
<i>I was a homeless orphan on the run
with a married woman.</i>

18:05.080 --> 18:06.680
<i>But no matter how bad life got...</i>

18:08.520 --> 18:09.920
<i>there was always something good.</i>

18:16.480 --> 18:18.000
<i>You had to focus on the good.</i>

18:28.040 --> 18:30.800
<i>♪ Won't you stay awhile? ♪</i>

18:31.800 --> 18:34.760
<i>♪ Come sit next to me ♪</i>

18:35.800 --> 18:38.520

18:48.600 --> 18:49.680
I love you.

18:50.200 --> 18:52.720
- What?
- I said, "It's time. Let's go."

19:09.320 --> 19:11.000
- James.
- Shit.

19:12.040 --> 19:13.240
They don't even have security.

19:13.280 --> 19:15.520
- He's just put on a jacket.
- What do we do?

19:22.080 --> 19:23.080
Come on.

19:31.840 --> 19:33.720

Sorry.

19:43.600 --> 19:44.840
It's okay.

19:46.800 --> 19:49.400
I can't cut those ones off.
You'll have to drive through them.

19:49.480 --> 19:51.040
- What?
- Yeah.

19:58.560 --> 20:00.080
What the fuck, James?

20:00.160 --> 20:01.880
I didn't want to make too much noise.

20:01.960 --> 20:03.960
- Oi!
- Oh, what, not to disturb him?

20:04.040 --> 20:05.760
Yeah, nice one.

20:36.400 --> 20:38.320
<i>For a moment, it was like old times.</i>

20:40.600 --> 20:41.800
Do you still want to go back?

20:45.440 --> 20:47.440
- Alyssa?
- We should stop.

20:48.440 --> 20:49.960
- What?
- The hitchhiker.

20:50.520 --> 20:51.920
She's a woman.
She's on her own.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.240
What if some weirdo picks her up?

20:55.680 --> 20:57.400
Yeah. Okay.

21:02.240 --> 21:03.240
You all right?

21:14.400 --> 21:15.400
Hi.
