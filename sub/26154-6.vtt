Yes, yes, I see you. Get in. Get in.

00:25.275 --> 00:28.319
[music playing over radio]

00:28.403 --> 00:30.739
Your mother's having another one
of her episodes.

00:30.822 --> 00:32.490
Last night, she went to see  A Doll's House

00:32.574 --> 00:35.076
with a couple girlfriends,
and now she has ideas.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.911
I emerged from my sanctum, this afternoon,

00:36.995 --> 00:39.372
to discover that not only had she
not made me lunch,

00:39.456 --> 00:41.541
which is a meal I need in order to live,

00:41.624 --> 00:45.628
but she'd furthermore, locked herself
in the bedroom to weep... loudly.

00:45.837 --> 00:47.589
Now, it's one thing for a woman to weep,

00:47.672 --> 00:50.383
but when they do it at such a volume
you can hear it through the door,

00:50.467 --> 00:52.677
then you know they're doing it
just for the attention.

00:53.011 --> 00:56.431
Anyway, I was able to cobble together
a sandwich for myself,

00:56.514 --> 00:59.184
so, I'm the real hero of the story.

00:59.267 --> 01:00.977
-[horn honking]
-[tires screeching]

01:02.520 --> 01:03.897
It was a couple hours later

01:03.980 --> 01:06.274
when I realized I was on a good run
with my novel.

01:06.357 --> 01:09.819
I had this really interesting sentence
that kept going for pages and pages,

01:09.903 --> 01:12.947
and I thought about how rare it is
to really get in the groove like that.

01:13.031 --> 01:15.075
How, most days, I can't concentrate

01:15.158 --> 01:17.994
because my idiot child
is blasting the television,

01:18.078 --> 01:20.413
and it suddenly dawned on me;
hot cock on a rock,

01:20.497 --> 01:23.666
she never even picked up
the little noise and snot factory!

01:23.750 --> 01:25.752
[tires screech, horn honking]

01:26.795 --> 01:29.798
So, here I am, being your mother,

01:29.881 --> 01:33.510
which I know is giving you all sorts
of mixed-up ideas about gender,

01:33.593 --> 01:35.595
while your brain
is still loose and stupid.

01:35.720 --> 01:36.679
Just remember,

01:36.763 --> 01:39.891
if you become a queer later in life,
this isn't my fault!

01:39.974 --> 01:43.645
Don't you sing no songs in your nightclub
act called, "My Daddy was My Mommy,"

01:43.728 --> 01:46.689
while gazing longingly
at a tangled string of pearls.

01:46.773 --> 01:48.608
Pearls are for ladies, BoJack.

01:49.234 --> 01:51.861
Pearls are for ladies.

01:52.904 --> 01:54.697
You know Sunday is my writing day.

01:54.781 --> 01:57.951
Sundays are the one day
that are just for me and my craft,

01:58.034 --> 02:00.370
and still, you and the black hole
that birthed you

02:00.453 --> 02:01.996
conspire to ruin it for me.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.499
What am I supposed to do now?
Just go back to writing?

02:04.582 --> 02:07.043
I'm out of the zone now,
the whole day's shot!

02:07.127 --> 02:09.379
All because of you
and that brittle wisp of a woman

02:09.462 --> 02:11.297
you made the mistake
of making your mother.

02:13.341 --> 02:15.718
[sighs] No. It's not her fault.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.762
She's doing the best she can, after all.

02:17.846 --> 02:20.348
It's just that...
you can't depend on women.

02:20.431 --> 02:22.100
You can't depend on anyone.

02:22.183 --> 02:23.518
Sooner or later, you need to learn

02:23.601 --> 02:25.645
that no one else
is gonna take care of you.

02:25.895 --> 02:28.523
That's what I learned
when I had to make my own sandwich.

02:28.606 --> 02:30.525
You can't rely on other people, BoJack.

02:30.608 --> 02:32.235
It's good for you to know that.

02:32.318 --> 02:34.529
And she's a good mother
for teaching you that.

02:34.612 --> 02:36.447
You've got a head start on most kids.

02:37.073 --> 02:38.992
You're actually very lucky.

02:39.075 --> 02:41.661
[music continues over radio]

02:43.621 --> 02:46.249
Thaaaaank youuuuu?

02:46.374 --> 02:48.376
[theme music playing]

03:41.971 --> 03:44.432
So, I stopped at a Jack in the Box,
on the way here,

03:44.515 --> 03:48.645
and the girl behind the counter said,
"Hiya! Are you having an awesome day?"

03:48.728 --> 03:52.732
Not, "How are you doing today?"
No. "Are you having an awesome day?"

03:52.815 --> 03:56.319
Which is pretty shitty because it puts
the onus on me to disagree with her,

03:56.402 --> 04:00.615
like if I'm not having an "awesome day,"
suddenly I'm the negative one.

04:00.698 --> 04:03.952
Usually, when people ask how I'm doing,
the real answer is I'm doing shitty,

04:04.035 --> 04:05.286
but I can't say I'm doing shitty

04:05.370 --> 04:07.413
because I don't have a good reason
to be doing shitty.

04:07.497 --> 04:10.875
So if I say, "I'm doing shitty,"
then they say, "Why? What's wrong?"

04:10.959 --> 04:13.628
And I have to be like,
"I don't know, all of it?"

04:13.711 --> 04:18.591
So instead, when people ask how I'm doing,
I usually say, "I am doing so great."

04:18.675 --> 04:22.053
But when this girl at the Jack in the Box
asked me if I was having an awesome day,

04:22.136 --> 04:24.806
I thought, well, today
I'm actually allowed to feel shitty,

04:24.889 --> 04:28.518
today I have a good reason,
so I said to her, "Well, my mom died."

04:28.601 --> 04:30.895
And she immediately burst into tears.

04:30.979 --> 04:33.731
So, now I have to comfort her,
which is annoying,

04:33.815 --> 04:36.109
and meanwhile, there's a line
of people forming behind me,

04:36.192 --> 04:38.027
who are all giving me
these real judgy looks

04:38.111 --> 04:39.779
because I made
the Jack in the Box girl cry.

04:39.862 --> 04:42.532
And she's bawling, and she's saying,
"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry,"

04:42.615 --> 04:44.325
and I'm like, "It's fine. It's fine.

04:44.409 --> 04:47.745
I mean, it's not fine,
but, you know, it's... fine.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.914
And I would like to order
a Double Jack Meal,

04:49.998 --> 04:51.416
and I've kinda got somewhere to be,

04:51.499 --> 04:54.085
so maybe less with the crying
and more with the frying, huh?"

04:54.168 --> 04:56.879
[inhales] And the girl apologizes, again,

04:56.963 --> 04:59.215
and she offers me a free churro
with my meal.

04:59.299 --> 05:02.635
And as I'm leaving,
I think, "I just got a free churro

05:02.719 --> 05:04.345
because my mom died."

05:04.429 --> 05:07.598
No one ever tells you when your mom dies,
you get a free churro.

05:07.682 --> 05:09.934
[people murmuring]

05:10.852 --> 05:12.603
[clears throat] Anyway, I'm sorry,

05:12.687 --> 05:14.731

Okay, here we go. Let's do this.

05:16.274 --> 05:19.736
Here I am, BoJack Horseman,
doing a eulogy, let's go.

05:19.819 --> 05:22.405
Hey, piano man,
can I get like a, like an organ flourish?

05:22.488 --> 05:24.032
[organ plays]

05:24.115 --> 05:26.117
Nicely done.
You know, I was a little worried

05:26.200 --> 05:27.994
I wouldn't have the right
accompaniment today.

05:28.202 --> 05:30.830
I guess it's a good thing my mom
was an organ donor!

the comedy to the professionals?

05:36.961 --> 05:38.755
Okay? This is a funeral, sir,
for my mother.

Can you show a little respect?

Beatrice Horseman, who was she?
What was her deal?

05:46.220 --> 05:47.388
Well, she was a horse.

05:47.472 --> 05:50.558
Uh, she was born in 1938.
She died in 2018.

05:50.641 --> 05:51.934
One time, she went to a parade,

05:52.018 --> 05:55.021
and one time, she smoked
an entire cigarette in one long inhale.

05:55.104 --> 05:55.980
I watched her do it.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.066
Truly a remarkable woman.

05:58.691 --> 06:00.943
[rustling]

06:01.444 --> 06:03.279
Lived a full life, that lady.

06:03.363 --> 06:07.784
Just, all the way to the end,
which is, uh, now, I guess.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.286
Really makes you think, though, huh?

06:10.370 --> 06:14.791
Life, right? Goes by, stuff happens.
Then you die.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.752
Well, that's my time,
you've been great! Tip your waitress!

06:17.835 --> 06:19.754
No, I'm just kidding around,
there's no waitress.

06:19.837 --> 06:21.756
That's all I have to say about my mother.

06:21.839 --> 06:23.466
No point beating a dead horse, right?

06:23.800 --> 06:28.054
So... [inhales] Now what?
I don't know, Mom, you got any ideas?

06:29.222 --> 06:30.181
Anything?

06:30.515 --> 06:31.432
Mom?

06:31.682 --> 06:32.600
No?

06:32.934 --> 06:35.728
Nothing to contribute?
Knock once if you're proud of me.

06:37.397 --> 06:40.441
Can I just say how amazing it is
to be in a room with my mother,

06:40.525 --> 06:43.903
and I can just talk without her telling me
to shut up and make her a drink?

06:44.028 --> 06:46.155
Hey, Mom. Knock once
if you think I should shut up.

06:46.948 --> 06:48.199
No? You sure?

06:48.408 --> 06:52.078
I mean, I don't want to embarrass you,
by making this eulogy into a me-logy,

06:52.161 --> 06:53.955
so, seriously,
if you wanted me to sit down

06:54.038 --> 06:56.749
and let someone else talk, just knock.
I will not be offended.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.127
No? Your funeral.

06:59.710 --> 07:01.421
Sorry about the closed casket, by the way.

07:01.629 --> 07:02.880
She wanted an open casket,

07:02.964 --> 07:06.008
but, you know, she's dead now,
so who cares what she wanted?

07:06.092 --> 07:07.510
No, that sounds bad. I'm sorry.

07:07.593 --> 07:10.930
I think that if she could've seen
what she looked like dead,

07:11.013 --> 07:13.850
she'd agree it's better this way.
She looked like this.

07:13.933 --> 07:17.145
-[groaning]
-[mourners gasping]

07:17.228 --> 07:21.065
Kinda like a pissed-off toy dinosaur.
The coroner couldn't get her eyes closed.

07:21.149 --> 07:22.608
So, now her face is forever frozen

07:22.692 --> 07:25.403
in a mask of tremendous horror
and anguish.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.405
Or as my mom called it, Tuesday!

07:28.739 --> 07:31.284
Tuesday! My mom called it Tuesday.

07:31.742 --> 07:32.577
[woman coughs]

07:32.785 --> 07:35.037
Hey, Mom, what did you think of that joke?
You like that?

07:35.121 --> 07:36.080
[woman coughs]

07:36.164 --> 07:37.957
You never did care for my comedy.

07:38.583 --> 07:39.750
[clears throat]

07:39.834 --> 07:41.002
Here's a story.

07:41.085 --> 07:42.211
When I was a teenager,

07:42.295 --> 07:46.007
I performed a comedy routine
for my high school talent show.

07:46.215 --> 07:48.134
There was this cool jacket
that I wanted to wear

07:48.217 --> 07:50.178
because it would make me
look like Albert Brooks.

07:50.261 --> 07:52.221
For months, I saved up for this jacket,

07:52.305 --> 07:55.600
but when I finally had enough,
I went to the store and it was gone.

07:55.683 --> 07:58.728
They had just sold it to someone else.
So, I went home and I told my mother.

07:58.811 --> 08:00.062
She said, "Let that be a lesson.

08:00.146 --> 08:02.690
That's the good
that comes from wanting things."

08:02.773 --> 08:04.775
She was really good
at dispensing life lessons,

08:04.859 --> 08:07.612
that always seemed to circle back
to everything being my fault.

08:08.029 --> 08:12.074
But then, on the day of the talent show,
my mother had a surprise for me.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.784
She had bought me the jacket.

08:13.868 --> 08:17.455
Even though she didn't know how to say it,
I knew this meant that she loved me.

08:18.122 --> 08:19.999
Now, that's a good story about my mother.

08:20.082 --> 08:22.752
It's not true,
but it's a good story, right?

08:22.835 --> 08:25.171
I stole it from an episode of  Maude  I saw
when i was a kid,

08:25.254 --> 08:26.881
where she talks about her father.

08:26.964 --> 08:29.717
I remember when I saw it,
thinking that's the kind of story

08:29.800 --> 08:32.094
I want to tell
about my parents when they die.

08:32.220 --> 08:34.180
But I don't have any stories like that.

08:34.430 --> 08:37.350
All I know about being good
I learned from TV.

08:37.433 --> 08:40.561
And in TV, flawed characters
are constantly showing people they care

08:40.645 --> 08:42.271
with these surprising grand gestures.

08:42.355 --> 08:45.983
And I think that part of me
still believes that's what love is.

08:46.108 --> 08:48.903
But in real life,
the big gesture isn't enough.

08:48.986 --> 08:51.697
You need to be consistent,
you need to be dependably good.

08:51.781 --> 08:54.700
You can't just screw everything up,
and then take a boat out into the ocean

08:54.784 --> 08:57.453
to save your best friend,
or solve a mystery, and fly to Kansas.

08:57.537 --> 09:01.249
You need to do it every day,
which is so... hard.

09:01.999 --> 09:04.043
When you're a kid, you convince yourself

09:04.126 --> 09:06.379
that maybe the grand gesture
could be enough.

09:06.462 --> 09:09.006
That even though your parents
aren't what you need them to be,

09:09.090 --> 09:11.092
over and over and over again,

09:11.175 --> 09:15.221
at any moment they might surprise you,
with something... wonderful.

09:15.721 --> 09:17.265
I kept waiting for that, the proof,

09:17.348 --> 09:19.684
that even though my mother
was a hard woman,

09:19.767 --> 09:22.520
deep down, she loved me
and cared about me

09:22.603 --> 09:24.105
and wanted me to know

09:24.188 --> 09:26.440
that I made her life
a little bit brighter.

09:26.941 --> 09:29.277
Even now, I find myself waiting.

09:30.278 --> 09:32.780
Hey, Mom, knock once if you love me
and care about me,

09:32.863 --> 09:35.283
and want me to know I made your life
a little bit brighter.

09:35.491 --> 09:37.285
[owl chirping]

09:38.035 --> 09:40.997
My mother did not go  gentle
into that good night.

09:41.080 --> 09:44.959
She went clawing and fighting
and thrashing, hence the face.

09:45.042 --> 09:46.794
-[groaning]
-[mourners gasping]

09:47.378 --> 09:48.212
If you'd seen her,

09:48.296 --> 09:50.715
I swear to God the only thing
you'd be thinking about right now

09:50.798 --> 09:53.301
is that I am nailing this impression.

09:53.384 --> 09:55.261
-[woman clears her throat]
-[chairs squeak]

09:55.344 --> 09:57.638
I was in the hospital with her
those last moments,

09:57.722 --> 10:01.684
and they were truly horrifying,
full of nonsensical screams and cries,

10:01.767 --> 10:05.187
but there was this moment,
this one instant of strange calm,

10:05.271 --> 10:08.566
where she looked in my direction
and said, "I see you."

10:09.400 --> 10:12.069
That's the last thing she said to me.
"I see you."

10:12.153 --> 10:16.032
Not a statement of judgment
or disappointment, just acceptance

10:16.115 --> 10:19.243
and the simple recognition
of another person in a room.

10:19.702 --> 10:22.705
"Hello, there. You are a person.
And I see you."

10:23.873 --> 10:25.041
Let me tell you,

10:25.124 --> 10:27.001
it's a weird thing to feel
at 54 years old,

10:27.084 --> 10:29.754
that for the first time in your life
your mother sees you.

10:29.837 --> 10:32.298
It's an odd realization that it's
the thing you've been missing,

10:32.381 --> 10:35.092
the only thing you wanted all along,
to be seen.

10:35.176 --> 10:37.511
And it doesn't feel like a relief,
to finally be seen.

10:37.595 --> 10:39.555
It feels mean, like,

10:39.930 --> 10:41.891
"Oh, it turns out that you knew
what I wanted,

10:41.974 --> 10:44.727
and you waited until the very last moment
to give it to me."

10:44.810 --> 10:46.312
I was prepared for more cruelty.

10:46.395 --> 10:48.689
I was sure that she would get
in one final zinger,

10:48.773 --> 10:52.026
about how I let her down,
and about how I was fat and stupid,

10:52.109 --> 10:54.779
and too tall to be
an effective Lindy-hopper.

10:54.904 --> 10:58.157
How I was needy and a burden
and an embarrassment.

10:58.240 --> 11:02.453
All that I was ready for.
I was not ready for "I see you."

11:03.537 --> 11:05.873
Only my mother would be lousy enough
to swipe me

11:05.956 --> 11:08.125
with a moment of connection
on her way out.

11:08.876 --> 11:12.213
But maybe I'm giving her too much credit.
Maybe it wasn't about connection.

11:12.296 --> 11:17.802
Maybe it was a... Maybe it was
an "I see you," like, "I see you."

11:17.885 --> 11:19.845
Like, "You might have the rest
of the world fooled,

11:19.929 --> 11:21.681
but I know exactly who you are."

11:21.764 --> 11:23.224
That's more my mom's speed.

11:24.016 --> 11:27.561
Or maybe she just literally meant
"I see you.

11:27.645 --> 11:30.606
You are an object
that has entered my field of vision."

11:31.065 --> 11:33.192
She was out of it at the end,
so maybe it's dumb

11:33.275 --> 11:34.985
to try to attribute it to anything.

11:35.069 --> 11:36.904
-[woman sighs]
-Back in the 90s,

11:36.987 --> 11:39.824
I was in a very famous TV Show
called  Horsin' Around.

11:40.241 --> 11:42.535
-[man coughs]
-Please hold your applause.

11:42.785 --> 11:44.912
And I remember one time, a fan asked me,

11:44.995 --> 11:46.747
"Hey, um, you know that episode

11:46.831 --> 11:48.708
where the horse has to give Ethan
a pep talk,

11:48.791 --> 11:51.836
after Ethan finds out his crush
only asked him to the dance

11:51.919 --> 11:54.547
because her friends were having
a dorkiest date contest?

11:54.630 --> 11:56.257
In all the shots of the horse,

11:56.340 --> 11:59.009
you can see a paper coffee cup
on the kitchen counter,

11:59.093 --> 12:02.263
but in the shots of Ethan,
the coffee cup's missing.

12:02.346 --> 12:04.682
Was that because the show
was making a statement,

12:04.765 --> 12:07.059
about the fluctuant subjectivity of memory

12:07.143 --> 12:10.104
and how even two people
can experience the same moment

12:10.187 --> 12:12.314
in entirely different ways?

12:12.732 --> 12:14.942
And I didn't have the heart to be, like,

12:15.025 --> 12:19.572
"No, man, some crew guy
just left their coffee cup in the shot."

12:19.655 --> 12:22.450
So instead, I was, like... "Yeah."

12:23.617 --> 12:25.286
And maybe this is like that coffee cup.

12:25.369 --> 12:29.457
Maybe, we're dumb to try to pin
significance onto every little thing.

12:29.540 --> 12:33.669
Maybe, when someone says,
"I see you," it just means, "I see you."

12:34.879 --> 12:37.089
Then again, it's possible
she wasn't even talking to me.

12:37.173 --> 12:39.967
Because, if I'm being honest,
she wasn't really looking at me,

12:40.259 --> 12:42.678
she was looking past me.
There was nobody else in the room.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.555
I think she was talking to me,
but, honestly,

12:44.638 --> 12:47.266
she was so far gone at that point,
who knows what she was seeing.

12:47.516 --> 12:48.768
Who were you talking to, Mom?

12:49.894 --> 12:50.728
[sighs]

12:50.811 --> 12:53.105
Not saying, huh? Staying mum?

12:53.564 --> 12:54.648
No rimshot there?

12:54.732 --> 12:56.734
God, whatever I'm paying you,
it's too much.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.195
Maybe, she saw my dad.

12:59.278 --> 13:02.948
My dad died about ten years ago
of injuries he sustained during a duel.

13:03.282 --> 13:05.951
When your father dies,
you ask yourself a lot of questions.

13:06.035 --> 13:08.788
Questions like,
"Wait, did you say he died in a duel?"

13:08.871 --> 13:10.998
and "Who dies in a duel?"

13:11.081 --> 13:12.291
The whole thing was so stupid.

13:12.583 --> 13:15.002
Dad spent his entire life
writing this book,

13:15.085 --> 13:17.129
but he couldn't get any stores
to carry it,

13:17.213 --> 13:18.881
or any newspapers to review it.

13:19.131 --> 13:22.259
Finally, I guess this one newspaper
thought he was pretty hilarious,

13:22.343 --> 13:24.929
because they ran a review
and tore him to shreds.

13:25.012 --> 13:26.597
So, my father, ever the Proud Mary,

13:26.680 --> 13:29.600
decided he would not stand
for this besmirchment of his honor.

13:29.683 --> 13:32.937
He claimed the critic didn't understand
what it meant to be a man,

13:33.020 --> 13:36.398
so he demanded satisfaction
in the form of pistols at dawn.

13:36.649 --> 13:39.902
He wrote the paper, this letter,
saying anyone who didn't like his book,

13:39.985 --> 13:42.112
he would challenge to a duel,
anyone in the world.

13:42.196 --> 13:45.241
He'd even pay for airfare
to San Francisco and a night in a hotel.

13:45.324 --> 13:47.910
Well, eventually this found its way
to some kook in Montana,

13:47.993 --> 13:50.454
who was as batshit as he was
and took him up on the offer.

13:50.538 --> 13:54.458
They met at Golden Gate Park and agreed:
ten paces, then shoot.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.293
But in the middle of the ten paces,

13:56.377 --> 14:00.005
Dad turned to ask the guy if he'd actually
read the book and what he thought,

14:00.089 --> 14:01.799
but, not looking where he was going,

14:01.882 --> 14:04.844
tripped over an exposed root
and bashed his head on a rock.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.053
[murmur]

14:06.136 --> 14:08.305
I wish I'd known to go
to Jack in the Box then.

14:08.389 --> 14:10.724
I could have gotten a free churro.
It would've been nice

14:10.808 --> 14:13.936
to have something to show for being
the son of Butterscotch Horseman.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.772
My darling mother gave the eulogy.

14:16.856 --> 14:21.068
My entire life I never heard her say
a kind word to or about my father,

14:21.151 --> 14:22.528
but at his funeral she said,

14:22.611 --> 14:25.823
"My husband is dead,
and everything is worse now."

14:25.906 --> 14:26.740
[clearing throat]

14:26.991 --> 14:30.661
"My husband is dead,
and everything is worse now."

14:31.245 --> 14:34.123
I don't know why she said that.
Maybe she felt that's the kind of thing

14:34.206 --> 14:35.624
you're supposed to say at a funeral.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.544
Maybe she hoped one day
someone would say that about her.

14:38.627 --> 14:41.130
"My mother is dead,
and everything is worse now."

14:41.547 --> 14:44.008
Or maybe she knew
that he had frittered away

14:44.091 --> 14:46.719
all her inheritance,
and replaced it with crippling debt,

14:46.802 --> 14:48.971
which is a pretty shitty thing
to leave your widow with.

14:49.054 --> 14:52.725
"Bad news, you lost a husband,
but don't worry, you also lost the house!"

14:52.933 --> 14:55.311
Maybe Mom knew she'd have to sell
all her fancy jewelry

14:55.394 --> 14:56.312
and move into a home.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.397
Maybe that's what she meant by
"everything is worse."

14:58.731 --> 14:59.982
Is that what you meant, Mom?

15:00.816 --> 15:02.693
I gotta say,
I'm really carrying this double act.

15:02.776 --> 15:05.821
At least with Penn and Teller,
the quiet one does card tricks.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.907
Hey, piano man,
when I say something funny to my mom,

15:07.990 --> 15:09.533
how about you give me a rimshot?

15:09.617 --> 15:11.410
-[rimshot plays]
-Yeah, but not now.

15:11.493 --> 15:13.996
When I say something funny. Like, okay.

15:14.079 --> 15:17.750
What's the difference between my mother
and a disruptive expulsion of germs?

15:17.833 --> 15:20.961
One's a coughin' fit
and the other fits a coffin!

15:21.587 --> 15:24.048
-That's an example of a funny thing.
-[rimshot plays]

15:24.131 --> 15:25.257
Thank you. Let's try again.

15:25.341 --> 15:28.844
Hey, Mom. What's the difference between
my mother and a bunch of Easter eggs?

15:28.928 --> 15:33.182
One gets carried in a basket,
the other gets buried in a casket!

15:33.265 --> 15:35.059
-[rimshot plays]
-Ready for one more? Last one.

15:35.142 --> 15:37.436
What's the difference
between a first-year lit major

15:37.519 --> 15:39.313
and my mother, Beatrice Horseman?

15:39.396 --> 15:44.652
One is decently read,
and the other's a huge bitch!

15:44.735 --> 15:45.819
-[woman gasps]
-[murmers]

15:45.903 --> 15:47.696
Might have gone a little too far
with that one.

15:47.780 --> 15:51.200
That one might have been a little too
"my mom's a huge bitch" for the room.

15:51.283 --> 15:53.744
I'm sorry, Mother.
You're not a huge bitch.

15:53.827 --> 15:57.331
You were a huge bitch...
and now you're dead.

15:57.414 --> 15:58.248
[woman sighs]

15:58.624 --> 16:01.126
You know, the first time I ever performed
in front of an audience,

16:01.210 --> 16:03.337
it actually was, uh, with my mom.

16:03.420 --> 16:06.173
She used to put on these shows,
with her supper club in the living room,

16:06.256 --> 16:07.716
and she used to make... [inhales]

16:07.800 --> 16:09.593
She used to make me sing
"The Lollipop Song."

16:10.678 --> 16:13.013
[organ playing tune]

16:13.097 --> 16:14.848
Those parties, they were really something.

16:14.932 --> 16:17.393
There were skits and magic acts,

16:17.476 --> 16:20.020
and ethnically insensitive
vaudeville routines,

16:20.104 --> 16:23.983
and the big finale
was always a dance my mother did.

16:24.066 --> 16:27.361
She had this beautiful dress that she only
brought out for these parties,

16:27.444 --> 16:29.571
and she did this incredible number.

16:29.655 --> 16:32.950
It was so beautiful and sad.

16:33.534 --> 16:36.286
Dad hated the parties.
He'd lock himself in the study,

16:36.370 --> 16:38.497
and bang on the walls
for us to keep it down,

16:38.580 --> 16:41.917
but he always came out to see Mom dance.

16:42.251 --> 16:44.461
He'd linger in the doorway,
scotch in hand,

16:44.545 --> 16:48.007
and watch in awe, as this cynical,

16:48.090 --> 16:52.344
despicable woman he married...
took flight.

16:52.761 --> 16:56.765
And as a child who was completely
terrified of both my parents,

16:56.849 --> 17:00.352
I was always aware
that this moment of grace,

17:00.436 --> 17:01.437
it meant something.

17:02.229 --> 17:03.856
We understood each other, in a way.

17:03.939 --> 17:07.568
Me and my mom and my dad,
as screwed up as we all were,

17:07.651 --> 17:09.194
we did understand each other.

17:09.278 --> 17:12.531
My mother, she knew
what it's like to feel your entire life

17:12.614 --> 17:15.409
like you're drowning
with the exception of these moments,

17:16.160 --> 17:18.370
these very rare, brief instances,

17:18.454 --> 17:22.249
in which you suddenly remember...
you can swim.

17:22.499 --> 17:24.501
[flashback]

17:24.585 --> 17:27.171
[partygoers laughing]

17:27.254 --> 17:29.506
[classical music playing]

17:38.474 --> 17:42.186
But, then again, mostly not.
Mostly you're drowning.

17:42.269 --> 17:43.520
She understood that too.

17:43.604 --> 17:46.273
And she recognized that I understood it.
And Dad.

17:46.398 --> 17:49.276
All three of us were drowning,
and we didn't know how to save each other,

17:49.359 --> 17:52.613
but there was an understanding
that we were all drowning together.

17:53.155 --> 17:54.865
I would like to think
that's what she meant

17:54.948 --> 17:57.534
when we were in the hospital
and she said, "I see you."

17:57.951 --> 18:00.079
The weird thing
about both your parents being dead

18:00.162 --> 18:01.789
is it means that you're next.

18:02.039 --> 18:05.292
I mean, you know, obviously it's not
like there's a wait list for dying.

18:05.375 --> 18:08.378
Any one of us could get run over
by a Snapchatting teen at any moment.

18:08.462 --> 18:11.673
And you would think that knowing that
would make us more adventurous,

18:11.757 --> 18:13.133
and kind, and forgiving.

18:13.217 --> 18:16.553
But it makes us small,
and stupid, and petty.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.307
I actually had a near-death experience,
recently.

18:20.390 --> 18:22.935
A stunt went bad
and I fell off a building.

18:23.018 --> 18:25.395
I'm an actor. I do my own stunts.

18:25.521 --> 18:29.149
I'm on this new show  Philbert.
I'm Philbert. Star of the show.

18:29.233 --> 18:31.485
It hasn't come out yet,
but it's already getting Emmy buzz.

18:31.568 --> 18:33.028
Oh, speaking of buzz...
[inhales]

18:33.153 --> 18:34.696
I've to take
two of these every morning,

18:34.780 --> 18:37.741
but my days are so screwed up
'cause of the shooting schedule,

18:38.033 --> 18:40.035
I don't even know
what morning means anymore.

18:40.285 --> 18:41.620
There's a joke in there somewhere,

18:41.703 --> 18:43.789
about a guy
who's been to so many funerals,

18:43.872 --> 18:46.458
he doesn't even know
what mourning means anymore.

18:46.542 --> 18:49.419
Let you guys figure that one out
for yourselves. [gulps]

18:49.920 --> 18:51.296
Anyway, you know what I thought...

18:51.380 --> 18:54.466
when I was falling off the building
and I went into panic mode?

18:54.633 --> 18:58.053
The last thing that my stupid brain
could come up with before I died?

18:59.471 --> 19:00.597
"Won't they be sorry."

19:02.015 --> 19:03.559
-Cool thought, brain.
-[rimshot plays]

19:03.642 --> 19:04.476
No, that wasn't...

19:04.560 --> 19:06.770
Would you just... Dial it back, all right?

19:06.854 --> 19:09.481
I don't even know what "they"
I wanted to be sorry.

19:09.565 --> 19:12.734
My mom, even before she died,
could barely remember who I was.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.570
And of course, my dad's dead.

19:14.778 --> 19:17.406
The last conversation I ever had with him
was about his novel.

19:17.489 --> 19:19.783
He was so certain
this book was his legacy.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.451
Maybe he thought it would vindicate him

19:21.535 --> 19:25.122
for all the shitty things he ever did
in his stupid worthless life.

19:25.205 --> 19:27.833
Maybe it did. I don't know.
I never read it.

19:27.916 --> 19:29.626
Because why would I give him that?

19:30.794 --> 19:33.088
I used to be on this TV show
called  Horsin' Around.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.464
Seriously, hold your applause.

19:35.340 --> 19:36.967
-[man coughs]
-Well held.

19:37.259 --> 19:40.387
It was written by my friend Herb Kazzaz,
who's also dead now,

19:40.470 --> 19:42.472
and it starred this little girl
named Sarah Lynn.

19:43.473 --> 19:46.602
And it was about these orphans.
And early on, the network had a note,

19:46.685 --> 19:48.270
"Maybe don't mention
they're orphans,

19:48.353 --> 19:52.024
because audiences tend
to find orphans sad and not relatable."

19:52.149 --> 19:53.609
I never thought the orphans were sad.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.444
I always thought they were lucky

19:55.527 --> 19:58.906
because they could imagine their parents
to be anything they wanted.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.949
They had something to long for.

20:01.241 --> 20:04.745
Anyway, we did this one season finale,
where Olivia's birth mother comes to town.

20:04.870 --> 20:07.247
And she was a junkie,
but she's gotten herself cleaned up,

20:07.331 --> 20:08.957
and she wants to be
in Olivia's life again.

20:09.041 --> 20:12.127
And of course, she's like a perfect
grown-up version of Olivia,

20:12.211 --> 20:13.795
and they go to the mall together

20:13.879 --> 20:16.089
and get her ears pierced,
like she's always wanted and--

20:16.173 --> 20:19.009
Sorry, spoiler alert for the season six
finale of  Horsin' Around,

20:19.092 --> 20:21.345
if you're still working
your way through it.

20:22.137 --> 20:24.514
Anyway, the horse tries
to warn her, "Be careful,

20:24.598 --> 20:26.350
moms have a way of letting you down."

20:26.433 --> 20:29.478
But Olivia just thinks
the horse is jealous,

20:29.561 --> 20:32.147
and when the mom says
she's moving to California,

20:32.231 --> 20:34.066
Olivia decides to go with her.

20:34.149 --> 20:36.610
And the network really juiced
the cliffhanger:

20:36.693 --> 20:39.029
''Is Olivia gone for good?''

20:39.112 --> 20:41.865
But of course, because it's a TV show,
she was not gone for good.

20:41.949 --> 20:43.784
Of course, because it's a TV show,

20:43.867 --> 20:46.870
Olivia's mother had a relapse
and had to go back to rehab,

20:46.954 --> 20:48.872
so Olivia had to hitchhike
all the way home,

20:48.956 --> 20:52.084
getting rides from Mr. T,
Alf, and the cast of  Stomp.

20:52.167 --> 20:53.502
Of course that's what happened.

20:53.585 --> 20:57.256
Because, what are you gonna do,
just not have Olivia on the show?

20:57.339 --> 20:59.716
You can't have happy endings in sitcoms,
not really,

20:59.800 --> 21:02.761
because, if everyone's happy,
the show would be over,

21:02.844 --> 21:06.181
and above all else,
the show... has to keep going.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.933
There's always more show.

21:08.016 --> 21:11.728
And you can call  Horsin' Around  dumb,
or bad, or unrealistic,

21:11.812 --> 21:14.189
but there is nothing more realistic
than that.

21:14.273 --> 21:17.359
You never get a happy ending,
'cause there's always more show.

21:19.152 --> 21:20.404
I guess until there isn't.

21:21.905 --> 21:23.365
[chuckles]

21:23.448 --> 21:27.244
My mom would hate it if she knew
that I spent so much time at her funeral

21:27.327 --> 21:28.996
talking about my old TV show.

21:29.204 --> 21:31.331
Or maybe she'd think it was funny
that her idiot son

21:31.415 --> 21:33.083
couldn't even do this right. Who knows?

21:33.583 --> 21:36.003
She left no instructions
for what she wanted me to say.

21:36.086 --> 21:38.046
All I know is she wanted an open casket,

21:38.130 --> 21:40.757
and her idiot son
couldn't even do that right.

21:41.842 --> 21:43.218
I'll stand up here and pretend

21:43.302 --> 21:44.845
I understood
how to please that woman,

21:44.928 --> 21:48.557
even though so much of my life has been
wasted in vain attempts to figure it out.

21:48.640 --> 21:51.601
But I keep going back to that moment
in the ICU when she looked at me, and...

21:52.311 --> 21:53.145
"I-C-U."

21:54.604 --> 21:57.858
"I... see... you."

21:59.067 --> 22:02.321
Jesus Christ,
we were in the intensive care unit.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.448
She was just reading a sign.

22:07.075 --> 22:09.703
My mom died and all I got
was this free churro.

22:12.122 --> 22:14.207
You know the shittiest thing
about all of this?

22:14.291 --> 22:16.918
Is when that stranger behind the counter
gave me that free churro,

22:17.002 --> 22:20.756
that small act of kindness
showed more compassion

22:20.839 --> 22:23.425
than my mother gave me
her entire goddamn life.

22:23.508 --> 22:26.011
Like, how hard is it to do something nice
for a person?

22:26.303 --> 22:30.265
This woman at the Jack in the Box
didn't even know me.

22:30.349 --> 22:31.183
I'm your son.

22:31.975 --> 22:33.352
All I had was you!

22:35.020 --> 22:36.104
[inhales]

22:37.064 --> 22:38.774
I have this friend.

22:38.899 --> 22:40.442
And right around when I first met her,

22:40.525 --> 22:44.529
her dad died, and I actually went with her
to the funeral.

22:44.613 --> 22:47.324
And months later, she told me
that she didn't understand

22:47.407 --> 22:51.078
why she was still upset,
because she never even liked her father.

22:51.161 --> 22:54.247
It made sense to me, because I went
through the same thing when my dad died.

22:54.331 --> 22:57.417
And I'm going through the same thing now.
You know what it's like?

22:57.501 --> 22:59.878
It's like that show  Becker,
you know, with Ted Danson?

22:59.961 --> 23:01.338
I watched the entire run of it,

23:01.421 --> 23:03.507
hoping that it would get better,
and it never did.

23:04.007 --> 23:06.802
It had all the right pieces, but it just--
It couldn't put them together.

23:06.885 --> 23:07.886
And when it got canceled,

23:07.969 --> 23:10.430
I was really bummed out,
not because I liked the show,

23:10.514 --> 23:13.016
but because I knew it could be
so much better,

23:13.100 --> 23:17.020
and now it never would be.
And that's what losing a parent is like.

23:17.687 --> 23:18.730
It's like  Becker.

23:19.648 --> 23:23.443
Suddenly, you realize you'll never have
the good relationship you wanted,

23:23.527 --> 23:26.530
and as long as they were alive,
even though you'd never admit it,

23:26.613 --> 23:29.908
part of you,
the stupidest goddamn part of you,

23:29.991 --> 23:32.994
was still holding on to that chance.

23:33.078 --> 23:35.997
And you didn't even realize it
until that chance went away.

23:36.498 --> 23:40.544
"My mother is dead,
and everything is worse now."

23:41.169 --> 23:43.964
Because now I know
I will never have a mother

23:44.047 --> 23:46.299
who looks at me from across a room
and says,

23:46.383 --> 23:49.636
"BoJack Horseman, I see you."

23:50.762 --> 23:52.139
But I guess it's good to know.

23:52.889 --> 23:55.892
It's good to know
that there is nobody looking out for me,

23:55.976 --> 23:58.353
that there never was,
and there never will be.

23:58.437 --> 24:01.148
No, it's good to know that I am
the only one that I can depend on.

24:01.982 --> 24:05.110
And I know that now and it's good.
It's good that I know that.

24:05.193 --> 24:07.571
So... it's good my mother is dead.

24:08.029 --> 24:09.781
[gulps, sighs]

24:10.449 --> 24:12.576
Well. No point beating a dead horse.

24:12.659 --> 24:15.120
Beatrice Horseman was born in 1938,

24:15.203 --> 24:20.125
and she died in 2018,
and I have no idea... what she wanted.

24:23.003 --> 24:25.088
Unless she just wanted what we all want...

24:26.089 --> 24:27.007
to be seen.

24:42.731 --> 24:43.648
[slurps]

24:43.732 --> 24:44.983
[blows nose]

24:45.817 --> 24:47.444
Is this Funeral Parlor B?

24:47.569 --> 24:49.571
[funeral music]
