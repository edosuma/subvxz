00:00.834 --> 00:01.335
I'm an early bird,

00:01.369 --> 00:02.736
and I'm a night owl.

00:02.770 --> 00:05.339
So I'm wise
and I have worms.

00:05.373 --> 00:07.275
Now.

00:07.308 --> 00:09.143
Oh! Breakfast.

00:09.177 --> 00:10.811
I got you your sausage,
egg, and cheese biscuit.

00:10.844 --> 00:13.781
Yummy, yummy.
Thank you, Ryan.

00:13.814 --> 00:19.387
What was the thing you
needed me to come in early for?

00:19.420 --> 00:20.821
Um...

00:20.854 --> 00:23.424
the sausage, egg,
and cheese biscuit.

00:23.457 --> 00:27.328
But thank you,
and why don't you just...

00:27.361 --> 00:28.596
Take a couple of hours.

00:28.629 --> 00:29.697
Office is yours.

00:29.730 --> 00:32.400
Home Alone,
Risky Business.

00:32.433 --> 00:36.437
Take your pants off,
run around.

00:36.470 --> 00:37.605
Whatever you wanna do.

00:37.638 --> 00:40.441
I'm just gonna take a nap
in my car till work starts.

00:40.474 --> 00:41.509
Okay.

00:43.244 --> 00:45.346
See? Healthier.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.815
Gotta watch those carbs.

00:50.851 --> 01:00.128
*

01:21.349 --> 01:23.817
Today I, Michael Scott,
am becoming a homeowner.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.253
Investing in real estate.

01:25.286 --> 01:26.754
Diversifying.
Smart.

01:26.787 --> 01:29.223
Yes, it is.
Yes, it is.

01:29.257 --> 01:31.892
It is very important
to own property.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.527
Back in olden days,

01:33.561 --> 01:35.796
they would not even
let you vote

01:35.829 --> 01:36.864
unless you owned property.

01:36.897 --> 01:39.767
They'd throw you in the stocks
and humiliate you.

01:39.800 --> 01:40.801
And it worked.
Yes.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.236
We should bring
the stocks back.

01:42.270 --> 01:42.903
People will obey the law.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.205
There'd be less troublemakers.

01:44.238 --> 01:45.806
Maybe.

01:52.346 --> 01:56.184
Every so often,
Jim dies of boredom.

01:56.217 --> 01:58.752
I think today it was
the expense reports

01:58.786 --> 02:00.354
that did him in.

02:00.388 --> 02:01.722
And, uh, our deal is

02:01.755 --> 02:04.192
that it's up to me
to revive him.

02:04.225 --> 02:05.926
You see Dwight's coffee mug?
Mm-hmm.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.295
Sometimes when he's not here,

02:07.328 --> 02:09.197
I try to throw stuff in it.

02:09.230 --> 02:11.565
No way.

02:11.599 --> 02:13.267
Let's do this.

02:17.305 --> 02:18.472
Oh!

02:18.506 --> 02:22.210
Here.
Try paper clips.

02:22.243 --> 02:23.911
Oh, wait.
This message.

02:23.944 --> 02:25.179
For Dwight.

02:25.213 --> 02:26.280
Perfect.

02:28.282 --> 02:29.317
Uh!
Oh!

02:29.350 --> 02:30.418
You should go.

02:30.451 --> 02:31.552
Yes. Yes.

02:31.585 --> 02:32.753
Final walkthrough.
Mm-hmm.

02:32.786 --> 02:33.954
Sign the papers
at the condo.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.489
You have your lawyer there?

02:35.523 --> 02:36.890
Uh, I don't need one.
Can I be your representative?

02:36.924 --> 02:38.892
I don't need a representative.
I think I should be there.

02:38.926 --> 02:39.793
No, no.
No, I'm good.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.229
I can make sure
things are up to code.

02:41.262 --> 02:42.530
No, Dwight. I'm fine.
Please?

02:42.563 --> 02:44.232
I'm always the guy
that you rely on at work.

02:44.265 --> 02:45.233
Well, this isn't about work.

02:45.266 --> 02:46.567
This is closing on a condo.

02:46.600 --> 02:47.668
It's completely personal.

02:47.701 --> 02:49.670
So you're taking
a personal day?

02:50.904 --> 02:51.939
Accept that

02:51.972 --> 02:53.507
this is about
my living arrangement,

02:53.541 --> 02:54.942
and as boss,

02:54.975 --> 02:56.977
I need to have
a living arrangement

02:57.010 --> 02:58.212
in order to do work.

02:58.246 --> 02:59.580
Please?

02:59.613 --> 03:01.249
I'll make you proud.

03:01.282 --> 03:02.950
Okay, fine.
Yes, you can come.

03:02.983 --> 03:04.218
Yes!
As your representative?

03:04.252 --> 03:04.885
As my associate.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.954
Same thing.
No, it is not.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.722
I have been
Michael's number two guy

03:08.756 --> 03:10.624
for about five years.

03:10.658 --> 03:12.360
And we make a great team.

03:12.393 --> 03:14.662
We're like one of those
classic, famous teams.

03:14.695 --> 03:15.663
He's like Mozart,

03:15.696 --> 03:19.400
and I'm like...Mozart's friend.

03:19.433 --> 03:20.401
No.

03:20.434 --> 03:22.570
I'm like Butch Cassidy,

03:22.603 --> 03:26.240
and Michael is like Mozart.

03:26.274 --> 03:28.376
You try and hurt Mozart,

03:28.409 --> 03:30.278
you're gonna get
a bullet in your head

03:30.311 --> 03:32.246
courtesy of Butch Cassidy.

03:32.280 --> 03:35.383
Oh, most honorable Pamera.

03:35.416 --> 03:38.752
Not offensive because that's
the way they talk in movies.

03:38.786 --> 03:40.254
You headed out?
Uh, we are.

03:40.288 --> 03:41.555
Dwight and I are going
to the big thing.

03:41.589 --> 03:43.824
So why don't you have everybody

03:43.857 --> 03:45.359
work on their expense reports,

03:45.393 --> 03:47.461
and I'd like them in
by the end of the day.

03:47.495 --> 03:48.562
Okay.
Very good.

03:48.596 --> 03:49.697
Have a great time.
We will.

03:49.730 --> 03:50.531
Um, did you do the thing

03:50.564 --> 03:52.032
I asked you to do
about the magazines?

03:52.065 --> 03:53.634
Yeah, I changed them
to your new address.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.035
Good. The...

03:55.068 --> 03:56.404
Small Businessman?
Yep.

03:56.437 --> 03:59.573
Maxim

03:59.607 --> 04:00.674
Cracked?

04:00.708 --> 04:02.009
Yes.

04:02.042 --> 04:04.778
I changed your Cracked
magazine subscription.

04:04.812 --> 04:07.615
How about m--uh,

04:07.648 --> 04:12.720
Fine Arts...
Aficionado Monthly?

04:12.753 --> 04:13.987
No? Okay.

04:14.021 --> 04:15.356
Well, could you get on that?

04:15.389 --> 04:16.924
'Cause I don't
just read Cracked.

04:16.957 --> 04:18.326
Thank you.

04:18.359 --> 04:19.960
Okay.
See you soon.

04:19.993 --> 04:21.962
What kinda shocks
you got on this baby?

04:21.995 --> 04:24.765
I don't know.
Regular, normal ones.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.900
Nothin' fancy.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.936
Not my style.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.037
What are you doin'?

04:30.070 --> 04:31.405
I wanna put the top down.

04:31.439 --> 04:32.906
No, Dwight.
It's 50 degrees outside.

04:32.940 --> 04:33.974
Don't--Please.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.943
Yeah, but then
no one can see us.

04:35.976 --> 04:38.078
I--Just, would you
put it up?

04:38.111 --> 04:40.514
Okay. Fine.

04:40.548 --> 04:41.849
Just leave it down.

04:41.882 --> 04:44.318
Whiner.

04:44.352 --> 04:45.953
Check it out.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.721
Terminator.

04:47.755 --> 04:50.924
I do not understand
what you spend your money on.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.526
Ooh.

04:52.560 --> 04:53.661
Hey, Oscar.

04:53.694 --> 04:54.595
Um, these new expense reports.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.730
Do we really have to go back
to last quarter?

04:56.764 --> 04:57.798
Yeah.

04:57.831 --> 04:59.533
It's a terrible system,
I know.

04:59.567 --> 05:01.001
What?

05:01.034 --> 05:03.437
What does "2005 season" mean?

05:03.471 --> 05:04.505
Tha

05:04.538 --> 05:06.073
Wait a minute.
What is this?

05:06.106 --> 05:06.940
It's a scoreboard.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.742
What?

05:08.776 --> 05:10.344
Kevin and I play
this paper football game

05:10.378 --> 05:11.512
when Michael's out.
Really?

05:11.545 --> 05:12.713
Yeah.
Or when we're bored.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.482
Oh, my God!

05:14.515 --> 05:16.650
Wait, this goes back
two years!

05:16.684 --> 05:18.719
We're bored a lot.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.921
Oh-ho.
Oh!

05:20.954 --> 05:22.423
Sweet.
Yes!

05:22.456 --> 05:23.924
So close.

05:23.957 --> 05:25.493
I really love the, uh,

05:25.526 --> 05:28.028
paper triangle flicking
and hitting things game.

05:28.061 --> 05:29.563
Yeah.
We call it Hateball.

05:29.597 --> 05:30.831
Why?

05:30.864 --> 05:33.734
Because of how much
Angela hates it.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.969
Hey, do you guys have
any other games?

05:36.003 --> 05:37.438
Sometimes we play

05:37.471 --> 05:39.640
Who Can Put the Most m&ms
in Their Mouth?

05:39.673 --> 05:41.575
You play that.

05:41.609 --> 05:42.676
You should ask Toby

05:42.710 --> 05:45.913
to teach you Dunderball.

05:45.946 --> 05:46.980
Home sweet home.

05:47.014 --> 05:50.017
Which one's yours?

05:50.050 --> 05:51.552
Right there.

05:51.585 --> 05:53.053
My sanctuary.

05:53.086 --> 05:54.555
My party pad.

05:54.588 --> 05:56.990
Someday I can just see

05:57.024 --> 05:59.026
my grandkids

05:59.059 --> 06:01.094
learning how to walk
out here.

06:01.128 --> 06:04.765
Hang a swing
from this tree.

06:04.798 --> 06:07.735
Push 'em back--

06:07.768 --> 06:08.969
Wait.

06:09.002 --> 06:11.439
No, it's this one
right here.

06:11.472 --> 06:13.140
Home sweet home.

06:17.077 --> 06:19.046
So that's what
this sound is all day.

06:20.514 --> 06:21.582
Michael, this is Bill.

06:21.615 --> 06:22.983
He's the head
of the Condo Association.

06:23.016 --> 06:24.051
Oh!
Hey, how are you?

06:24.084 --> 06:25.419
Nice to meet you, Bill.

06:25.453 --> 06:26.587
Bill. Mr. Bill.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.989
Oh, no!

06:29.022 --> 06:31.959
Mr. Bill!
Whoa! Ho-Ho!

06:31.992 --> 06:33.727
SNL?

06:33.761 --> 06:36.163
When they pull him apart?

06:36.196 --> 06:38.899
He would always get
rolled over by something.

06:38.932 --> 06:41.034
N-Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.670
This is smaller
than your old place.

06:42.703 --> 06:45.038
Yes, well, I'm buying it
and I'm not renting it.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.508
So it's still an upgrade.

06:47.541 --> 06:51.445
He doesn't know anything
about property ownership.

06:51.479 --> 06:52.980
He's kind of an idiot.
Um...

06:53.013 --> 06:55.015
Actually, I do own property.

06:55.048 --> 06:55.949
My grandfather left me

06:55.983 --> 06:58.018
a 60-acre working beet farm.

06:58.051 --> 07:00.087
I run it with my cousin Mose.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.556
We sell beets
to local stores

07:02.590 --> 07:04.492
and restaurants.

07:04.525 --> 07:06.794
It's a nice little farm.

07:06.827 --> 07:10.631
Sometimes teenagers
use it for sex.

07:10.664 --> 07:12.065
Are we ready
to sign some papers?

07:12.099 --> 07:13.100
Actually, no.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.768
We have a couple of questions,

07:14.802 --> 07:16.537
uh, about the neighborhood.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.506
I-It's very safe.
It's very clean.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.641
Uh, also, it's very accepting

07:20.674 --> 07:22.643
of all lifestyles.

07:24.111 --> 07:26.747
It's a very gay-friendly
neighborhood.

07:28.148 --> 07:30.518
Oh, good.
That's good.

07:30.551 --> 07:33.721
It's good to be
accommodating of...that.

07:33.754 --> 07:36.924
Let's go check out
the master bedroom.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.492
Stanley.

07:38.526 --> 07:39.993
I just spent an hour
playing Dunderball.

07:40.027 --> 07:41.762
What about you?
Do you have any games?

07:41.795 --> 07:42.896
Yeah, I got a game.

07:42.930 --> 07:46.066
It's called Work Hard
So My Kids Can Go To College.

07:46.099 --> 07:47.801
Fair enough.

07:49.537 --> 07:51.004
This, my friends,

07:51.038 --> 07:53.240
is the master bedroom.

07:53.273 --> 07:54.908
Check out
the cathedral ceilings.

07:54.942 --> 07:57.210
Those are, like,
17 feet high.

07:57.244 --> 07:59.980
We have cable readiness
right there.

08:00.013 --> 08:01.949
I am going to totally
pimp this place out.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.184
I am going to put
a surround sound system.

08:04.217 --> 08:05.853
I am going to put
a plasma screen

08:05.886 --> 08:07.120
right against this wall.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.756
Ooh, terrible idea.

08:08.789 --> 08:09.990
'Cause I'm putting my bed
right over here.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.525
No, no, no, no, no.
This is a shared wall.

08:11.559 --> 08:13.093
Neighbor throws
his wife into the wall,

08:13.126 --> 08:14.928
plasma screen hits the floor,
totally smashed.

08:14.962 --> 08:16.730
Well, the I will get
a warranty.

08:16.764 --> 08:18.599
Warranties don't cover it.
Plus, they're a rip-off.

08:18.632 --> 08:19.933
Well, then I won't
get a warranty.
Christina!

08:19.967 --> 08:21.902
Shh!
So, that's the problem.
It's solved.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.771
What?
I don't hear you practicing.

08:23.804 --> 08:24.905
Can you hear that?

08:26.674 --> 08:28.776
Oh, man!

08:28.809 --> 08:32.813
These babies are thin!

08:42.355 --> 08:43.624
This scented candle

08:43.657 --> 08:44.892
--andle, --andle...

08:44.925 --> 08:47.661
Which I found in the men's
bathroom, room, room...

08:47.695 --> 08:51.231
Represents the eternal...

08:51.264 --> 08:56.136
burning of competition
or something.

08:56.169 --> 08:57.905
It smells like cookies.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.172
Yes, it does.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.909
Yes, it does, my friend.

09:01.942 --> 09:03.243
Okay, we will be competing

09:03.276 --> 09:05.646
for gold, silver, and bronze

09:05.679 --> 09:07.080
yogurt lids.

09:07.114 --> 09:08.882
Now, the bronze
are really blue.

09:08.916 --> 09:10.584
And they're also
the backside of the gold,

09:10.618 --> 09:11.719
so no flipping.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.553
Okay?
Honor system.

09:18.158 --> 09:19.760
I do play games.

09:19.793 --> 09:20.928
I sing.

09:20.961 --> 09:23.063
And I dangle things
in front of my cats.

09:23.096 --> 09:25.132
I play lots of games.

09:25.165 --> 09:26.934
Just not at work.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.268
Let the games begin.

09:34.908 --> 09:37.110
And then I just need you
to sign here at this arrow.

09:37.144 --> 09:38.679
What kind of mortgage
did you get?

09:38.712 --> 09:40.180
Uh, 10-year.

09:40.213 --> 09:42.282
Well, 10 over 30,

09:42.315 --> 09:43.884
so 30-year total.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.786
What? Wha--

09:45.819 --> 09:48.989
You said 10. S--

09:49.022 --> 09:50.323
10-year fixed...

09:50.357 --> 09:51.825
over 30.

09:51.859 --> 09:53.293
30-year total.

09:53.326 --> 09:54.928
Huh. 30 years.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.163
Okay, okay, okay.

09:56.196 --> 09:59.132
Wow, you'll be payin' this off
in your mid 70s.

09:59.166 --> 10:00.300
All right.

10:00.333 --> 10:03.003
Forget about retiring
when you're 65.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.071
Hey, I've got an idea.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.305
You know that extra bedroom?

10:05.338 --> 10:07.107
If the whole girlfriend thing
never happens,

10:07.140 --> 10:08.308
that's where the nurse
can live.

10:08.341 --> 10:10.243
Okay, all right.

10:10.277 --> 10:12.279
Oh, boy.
Well, this is it.

10:12.312 --> 10:13.847
Whenever you're ready.

10:13.881 --> 10:15.015
Yeah. Um...

10:15.048 --> 10:18.051
Ho. Ho-okay.

10:18.085 --> 10:19.119
Is that supposed to come off?

10:19.152 --> 10:20.988
Actually, yes.
Hey, look, cool.
Carpenter ants.

10:21.021 --> 10:24.024
Um...Gonna take
a little, uh, breather

10:24.057 --> 10:25.092
for a second.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.259
Excuse me.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.360
It'll be here
waiting for you.

10:27.394 --> 10:29.129
Oh, man.

10:29.162 --> 10:30.197
A 30-year mortgage

10:30.230 --> 10:31.431
at Michael's age

10:31.464 --> 10:33.400
essentially means that he's
buying a coffin.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.202
If I were buying my coffin,

10:35.235 --> 10:37.270
I would get one
with thicker walls

10:37.304 --> 10:39.907
so you couldn't hear
the other dead people.

10:43.010 --> 10:45.112
Oh!
Whenever you're ready, Michael.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.914
Ugh!

10:46.947 --> 10:49.817
You have what is
the national sport

10:49.850 --> 10:51.885
of Icelandic paper companies.

10:51.919 --> 10:54.054
And I'm blanking
on the name.

10:54.087 --> 10:55.789
Could you help me out, Pam?

10:55.823 --> 10:58.025
Jim, they refer to it as...

10:58.058 --> 10:59.960
Flonkerton.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.028
Hmm.

11:01.061 --> 11:02.162
In English,

11:02.195 --> 11:03.263
Box of Paper Snowshoe Racing.

11:03.296 --> 11:04.898
Fair enough,

11:04.932 --> 11:08.101
but I like Flonkerton.

11:08.135 --> 11:09.336
The thing about Jim is,

11:09.369 --> 11:11.071
when he's excited
about something,

11:11.104 --> 11:12.840
like the office Olympics,

11:12.873 --> 11:14.074
he gets really into it

11:14.107 --> 11:16.910
and he does a really great job.

11:16.944 --> 11:18.378
But the problem with Jim

11:18.411 --> 11:19.980
is that he works here,

11:20.013 --> 11:22.850
so that hardly ever happens.

11:22.883 --> 11:25.118
So who will be
challenging Kevin

11:25.152 --> 11:26.419
in Flonkerton?

11:26.453 --> 11:28.155
Anyone.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.189
I'll do it.

11:29.222 --> 11:31.024
Yes! Phyllis!

11:33.393 --> 11:36.329
Phyllis, if you'd just put
your foot right through here.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.098
Right through the flonk.

11:38.131 --> 11:41.101
The ceilings are lower
than they were last week.

11:41.134 --> 11:42.235
That--I don't--

11:42.269 --> 11:44.071
What?
I don't know if you showed me

11:44.104 --> 11:45.138
this same unit or not.

11:45.172 --> 11:47.174
Where--
Michael, this is
the unit you saw, and--

11:47.207 --> 11:50.043
Where are all the hot people?

11:50.077 --> 11:51.111
I was told that there would be

11:51.144 --> 11:52.880
all these attractive singles.

11:52.913 --> 11:54.882
Who told you that?
And as far as I can tell,

11:54.915 --> 11:56.049
I'm the best-looking
person here.

11:56.083 --> 11:57.751
There's a basic principle
in real estate

11:57.785 --> 11:59.252
that you should never be

11:59.286 --> 12:01.154
the best-looking person
in the development.

12:01.188 --> 12:02.856
It's just sorta common sense,

12:02.890 --> 12:04.091
because if you are,

12:04.124 --> 12:08.461
then you have no place
to go but down.

12:08.495 --> 12:09.863
Is this a financial thing?

12:09.897 --> 12:10.998
If it's financial thing,

12:11.031 --> 12:13.066
what some people do is,
they rent out the third bedroom.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.367
No, no. No, no, no, no.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.836
And that's some
extra income for you.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.370
I am not going to rent
the third bedroom.

12:17.404 --> 12:21.208
I want a price reduction
or I am a-walkin'.

12:21.241 --> 12:25.312
You will lose $7,000
if you walk away right now.

12:25.345 --> 12:29.049
Muh...

12:29.082 --> 12:30.784
I made the right decision.

12:30.818 --> 12:32.152
I'm glad I signed.

12:32.185 --> 12:33.553
The--I'm a homeowner.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.088
Right?

12:35.122 --> 12:36.890
Good to be a homeowner.
Diversifying.

12:36.924 --> 12:38.491
This is good.

12:38.525 --> 12:40.427
This is fun.
We're havin' fun.

12:40.460 --> 12:41.862
Totally havin' fun.

12:41.895 --> 12:43.063
Can you imagine those poor saps

12:43.096 --> 12:44.531
stuck at the office today?

12:46.867 --> 12:48.435
Here we go. Here we go.

12:50.037 --> 12:51.071
Dig deep.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.539
Dig deep!

12:54.141 --> 12:55.208
Oh!

12:55.242 --> 12:56.276
It's Phyllis!
It's Phyllis.

12:56.309 --> 12:57.377
Phyllis by a nose.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.012
Gold medal in Flurnenton.

12:59.046 --> 13:00.247
Flonkerton!

13:00.280 --> 13:02.215
Thank you,
delegate from Iceland.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.158
Wow. Okay.

13:11.191 --> 13:13.093
No one else should even try.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.294
Gold medals.

13:14.327 --> 13:16.463
Give him medals.

13:16.496 --> 13:18.298
Wow!

13:20.400 --> 13:22.102
There's somethin' else, Dwight,

13:22.135 --> 13:23.904
wanted to talk to you about.

13:23.937 --> 13:25.438
I have a surprise for you.

13:25.472 --> 13:26.907
For helpin' me out today.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.475
Oh, you didn't have to do--
No.

13:28.508 --> 13:29.910
No.
I insist, I insist.

13:29.943 --> 13:31.178
Because you've really done
some great work.

13:31.211 --> 13:32.345
Great work!

13:32.379 --> 13:34.915
And that is why
I am going to let you

13:34.948 --> 13:37.084
move into my third bedroom

13:37.117 --> 13:39.086
and pay me rent.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.322
Why did I do it?

13:42.355 --> 13:45.425
Because I believe in rewarding
people for their efforts.

13:45.458 --> 13:48.896
Uh, I rewarded Dwight

13:48.929 --> 13:50.497
with the room,

13:50.530 --> 13:53.166
and he is rewarding me back

13:53.200 --> 13:56.203
with, uh, $500
plus utilities.

13:56.236 --> 13:58.271
I don't even know
what to say.

13:58.305 --> 14:01.975
I'm thinkin', lock into
a four-year commitment.

14:02.009 --> 14:03.510
We'll go month-to-month
after that.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.445
Or until I start dating,

14:05.478 --> 14:07.080
have a girlfriend.

14:07.114 --> 14:08.381
And then you're, you know,

14:08.415 --> 14:09.482
you're gone, so...

14:09.516 --> 14:12.352
Question: Where can I put
my terrarium?

14:14.254 --> 14:16.056
What hell is a terrarium?

14:16.089 --> 14:18.658
It's a fish tank
for snakes and lizards.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.360
Oh, so, an aquarium?

14:21.694 --> 14:23.596
Uh, that...

14:23.630 --> 14:26.066
will not come into this place.

14:26.099 --> 14:27.634
Okay?
Question:

14:27.667 --> 14:28.902
Oh, my God.

14:28.936 --> 14:29.970
My grandparents left me

14:30.003 --> 14:32.605
a large number of armoires.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.074
Are you sure you don't
wanna play?

14:34.107 --> 14:34.908
I'm sure.

14:34.942 --> 14:36.910
Come on, Angela.
Don't you have a game?

14:36.944 --> 14:39.079
I have one, yes.

14:39.112 --> 14:41.214
Well, let's play.
What is it?

14:41.248 --> 14:43.150
I call it Pam Pong.

14:43.183 --> 14:45.452
I count how many times
Jim gets up from his desk

14:45.485 --> 14:47.620
and goes to reception
to talk to you.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.289
We're friends.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.224
Apparently.

14:51.258 --> 14:52.993
Very nicely done.

14:53.026 --> 14:55.695
Okay, so, think that's
H-O-R for Stanley

14:55.728 --> 14:57.130
and H-O for Phyllis.

14:57.164 --> 14:58.431
Are you calling me a ho?

14:58.465 --> 15:00.200
Oh, my God.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.970
Phyllis coming alive.
I like it.

15:03.003 --> 15:04.972
Question:
What about carpooling?

15:05.005 --> 15:06.206
Uh, who pays
for the gas?

15:06.239 --> 15:07.140
We take separate cars.

15:07.174 --> 15:08.976
Then question: Can sometimes
I drive your car

15:09.009 --> 15:10.010
and you drive mine?

15:10.043 --> 15:10.677
Why would we do that?

15:10.710 --> 15:12.279
Just for fun?
No.

15:12.312 --> 15:14.014
Question: Who's the primary
on the fire insurance?

15:14.047 --> 15:17.084
Game over!

15:17.117 --> 15:20.020
Offer revoked, Dwight.

15:20.053 --> 15:20.988
I'm sorry,

15:21.021 --> 15:23.290
but you reach out
and you try to be a nice guy

15:23.323 --> 15:24.457
and help out a friend,

15:24.491 --> 15:26.159
and this is what happens.

15:26.193 --> 15:27.660
This is what I get.

15:27.694 --> 15:30.063
I--God.

15:30.097 --> 15:32.265
I'm--Okay.

15:32.299 --> 15:33.433
Ooh.

15:33.466 --> 15:35.002
Thank God.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.669
It was nice of him to offer.

15:36.703 --> 15:39.072
But I live in a nine-bedroom
farmhouse.

15:39.106 --> 15:41.274
I have my own
crossbow range.

15:41.308 --> 15:43.243
It's a perfect situation
for me.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.545
Although two bathrooms
would have been nice.

15:45.578 --> 15:48.448
We just have the one.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.417
And it's under the porch.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.484
ding!

15:51.518 --> 15:52.652
Ah!
Oh!

15:52.685 --> 15:54.454
Who had somebody
from Van's Refrigeration?

15:54.487 --> 15:56.123
Ryan Howard.

15:56.156 --> 15:58.158
Ryan.

15:58.191 --> 16:00.127
Gold medal.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.529
I made something
for our closing ceremonies.

16:02.562 --> 16:03.663
What?

16:03.696 --> 16:05.165
Oh, my God!

16:05.198 --> 16:07.000
Where'd you have time
to make that?

16:07.034 --> 16:08.468
Automatic voice mail.

16:08.501 --> 16:10.637
All right, Pam.
All right.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.640
Nice work.

16:22.682 --> 16:25.118
You know you can always
refinance your mortgage.

16:25.152 --> 16:27.454
We had a 15-year
on our beet farm.

16:27.487 --> 16:28.555
We paid it off early.

16:28.588 --> 16:29.422
Yeah, well,
you know what?

16:29.456 --> 16:31.658
Nobody cares
about your stupid beet farm.

16:31.691 --> 16:33.660
Beets are the worst.

16:33.693 --> 16:35.428
People love beets.
Nobody likes beets.

16:35.462 --> 16:36.463
Everyone loves beets.

16:36.496 --> 16:39.066
Nobody likes beets, Dwight!

16:39.099 --> 16:41.501
Why don't you grow something
that everybody does like?

16:41.534 --> 16:44.704
You should grow candy.

16:44.737 --> 16:48.041
I'd love a piece
of candy right now.

16:48.075 --> 16:50.210
Not a beet.

16:50.243 --> 16:51.544
Let's get this roof goin'.

16:51.578 --> 16:53.046
Stop it!
Ow!

16:53.080 --> 16:54.514
Final lap!
Final lap!

16:54.547 --> 16:55.615
Oscar!

16:55.648 --> 16:56.616
Time to beat is 1:15.

16:56.649 --> 16:59.186
Time to beat is one minute,
15 seconds.

16:59.219 --> 17:00.387
Here they come!

17:06.093 --> 17:08.461
Guys?

17:08.495 --> 17:10.497
What is going on?

17:10.530 --> 17:11.698
Nothing.

17:11.731 --> 17:14.501
Guys
Or--

17:14.534 --> 17:15.802
That's my stopwatch.

17:34.854 --> 17:36.689
There you go.
All done.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.258
Great.

17:38.291 --> 17:41.094
Yeah, I filled out
the expense reports.

17:41.128 --> 17:42.495
That took about five minutes.

17:42.529 --> 17:45.532
And then I closed two sales
at lunchtime.

17:45.565 --> 17:49.602
So...about as productive
as any other day.

17:49.636 --> 17:52.239
If not more so.

17:58.478 --> 18:01.281
I figured I could
throw it away now,

18:01.314 --> 18:03.716
or I could keep it
for a couple of months

18:03.750 --> 18:05.785
and then throw it away.

18:05.818 --> 18:07.754
I mean, it was really nice
of Pam to make them,

18:07.787 --> 18:10.790
but what am I gonna do
with a gold medal

18:10.823 --> 18:15.795
made of paper clips
and an old yogurt lid?

18:23.836 --> 18:24.771
Hey.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.339
I have 59 voice mails.

18:26.373 --> 18:27.440
Mm.

18:27.474 --> 18:29.742
Hey, can you ignore those

18:29.776 --> 18:32.179
and do something for me instead?

18:32.212 --> 18:33.813
Sure.

18:33.846 --> 18:34.747
Okay.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.517
Today, 5:00...

18:37.550 --> 18:39.152
closing ceremonies.

18:39.186 --> 18:40.520
Really?

18:40.553 --> 18:42.189
Notify the athletes.

18:42.222 --> 18:43.690
Cool.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.327
Michael.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.296
Yeah?
Jim. Slim Jim.

18:49.329 --> 18:51.931
What's goin'

18:51.964 --> 18:54.534
Nothin'. I just wanted to
congratulate you on your condo.

18:54.567 --> 18:55.935
Oh, thanks.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.804
Thanks. It's very cool.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.706
It's, uh, three bedroom,
gay-friendly.

18:59.739 --> 19:01.741
Nice.
You know.

19:01.774 --> 19:03.576
Hey, would you mind
comin' out here for a second?

19:03.610 --> 19:04.877
I just have something for you.

19:04.911 --> 19:06.179
Really?

19:08.581 --> 19:10.417
What's this?

19:10.450 --> 19:12.352
There are
the closing ceremonies.

19:12.385 --> 19:13.686
Step up.

19:13.720 --> 19:16.223
W--Um...

19:16.256 --> 19:18.758
You're on the top one.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.627
Congratulations to Michael

19:20.660 --> 19:22.695
because he closed on his condo.

19:22.729 --> 19:24.264
So gold medal.

19:28.735 --> 19:33.606
I don't really know
what to say.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.542
Um...

19:36.876 --> 19:38.811
I'm not one
for making speeches,

19:38.845 --> 19:41.214
but, uh...

19:41.248 --> 19:43.783
my heart is very full
at this moment.

19:47.454 --> 19:49.856
And for Dwight Schrute,
the silver medal.

19:49.889 --> 19:52.759
Get on up here, Dwight.

19:58.765 --> 19:59.866
Silver medal.

19:59.899 --> 20:01.868
Yep.
Not as good as gold.

20:04.837 --> 20:08.408
*

20:08.441 --> 20:10.610
Why are you playing
the national anthem?

20:10.643 --> 20:14.013
Um, 'cause your condo's
in America.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.948
Oh.

20:21.554 --> 20:22.889
What the hell is that?

20:22.922 --> 20:24.791
Those are the doves.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.755
All right!
