00:10.844 --> 00:13.513
{\an8}<i>Grant was credited with raising</i>
<i>the profile of their community</i>

00:13.596 --> 00:15.598

None of us is
beyond redemption, Jason.

26:20.120 --> 26:21.663
People can change.

26:21.746 --> 26:25.458
You know, even
the most stubborn of us.

26:25.542 --> 26:27.127
All right.

26:27.210 --> 26:29.379
Well, don't get caught up
on the who.

26:29.462 --> 26:32.507
It's not about the who.

26:32.590 --> 26:34.175
Good night.

26:35.135 --> 26:37.178
Good night.

26:41.266 --> 26:43.101
JASON:
Okay, maybe she's right.

26:43.184 --> 26:46.354
I can't make Littleton better
by destroying it.

26:46.438 --> 26:47.856
A few more lights on that sign,

26:47.939 --> 26:50.233
and we'll really put
Littleton on the map.

26:59.492 --> 27:01.745
(electrical buzzing)

27:17.302 --> 27:19.554
(popping, crackling)

27:36.321 --> 27:37.781
I have apnea.

27:37.864 --> 27:41.076
This power outage
could kill me if I can't plug in

27:41.159 --> 27:41.910
my machine.

27:41.993 --> 27:43.203
WOMAN:
That's right.

27:43.286 --> 27:44.621
I can't operate my pumps!

27:44.704 --> 27:46.790
My-my register doesn't work!

27:46.873 --> 27:49.626
Nothing! When's the power
coming back on?

27:49.709 --> 27:51.711
(clamoring,
overlapping shouting)

27:51.795 --> 27:53.963
All right.
Now, everyone, please, uh,

27:54.047 --> 27:56.466
settle down, you know, uh,
settle down.

27:56.549 --> 27:58.259
Well, I just got off the phone
with the governor's office,

27:58.343 --> 28:00.887
and it seems we have a bigger
problem than we first thought.

28:00.970 --> 28:03.306
-Uh... sorry.
-WOMAN: What does that mean?

28:04.724 --> 28:06.434
Bear with me here.

28:06.518 --> 28:08.770
For some unknown reason...

28:08.853 --> 28:10.855
the new sign caused
some kind of power overload

28:10.939 --> 28:13.358
that destroyed the
Littleton County power center.

28:13.441 --> 28:14.609
-MAN: What?
-It says...

28:14.692 --> 28:17.237
"destroyed."

28:17.320 --> 28:18.780
Well, uh, (clears throat)
obviously,

28:18.863 --> 28:20.949
this is a-a serious
infrastructure problem,

28:21.032 --> 28:23.743
and, uh, it's gonna take
some time to rebuild.

28:23.827 --> 28:26.287
-Well, how long?
-Well, it could be weeks.

28:26.371 --> 28:27.372
-Weeks?
-(all clamoring)

28:27.455 --> 28:28.415
That's too long!

28:28.498 --> 28:29.958
(overlapping shouting)

28:30.041 --> 28:31.626
MRS. TURNER:
Why don't you just...

28:31.709 --> 28:34.295
you know, do your <i> thing?</i>

28:34.379 --> 28:36.172
Yeah, fix this.

28:36.256 --> 28:37.632
You're The Helper.

28:37.715 --> 28:40.802
Oh, well, I-I never
technically said that.

28:40.885 --> 28:42.470
-(all muttering)
-ANA: So...

28:42.554 --> 28:44.347
Wait, so you didn't add
those lights?

28:44.431 --> 28:45.640
The ones that caused the surge!

28:45.723 --> 28:47.892
We don't, uh,
exactly know what happened.

28:47.976 --> 28:49.644
Hey! You bungled this!

28:49.727 --> 28:51.020
-Just admit it!
-Yeah!

28:51.104 --> 28:52.480
(all clamoring)

28:52.564 --> 28:53.815
And we can't wait weeks!

28:53.898 --> 28:56.651
I'll bet he's trying
to force us to leave,

28:56.734 --> 28:59.821
so that he can buy us all out
on a discount!

28:59.904 --> 29:01.156
I bet that's exactly
what's going on!

29:01.239 --> 29:03.575
(all clamoring)

29:05.743 --> 29:09.914
(overlapping shouting,
clamoring)

29:13.376 --> 29:15.003
Gloria!

29:15.086 --> 29:16.838
(clamoring continues)

29:16.921 --> 29:18.006
(exclaims)

29:18.089 --> 29:19.007
Whoa...

29:19.090 --> 29:20.508
It's him!

29:20.592 --> 29:23.636
-Wait! Hold on! Wait!
-Grab him!

29:23.720 --> 29:25.180
Goddamn it, that kid!

29:25.263 --> 29:26.764
-What are you drawing?
-Don't let him get away!

29:26.848 --> 29:27.724
Ha!

29:27.807 --> 29:29.559
{\an5}-You see?
Look! Look! Look! Look!
-Hey!

29:29.642 --> 29:30.894
-MAN: What?
-You see?

29:30.977 --> 29:32.687
It's all the things
that have been happening

29:32.770 --> 29:33.855
in our town, look!

29:33.938 --> 29:36.191
I don't know
what sort of witchcraft

29:36.274 --> 29:38.026
or conspiracy is at play here,

29:38.109 --> 29:40.695
but whatever it is,

29:40.778 --> 29:42.530
this little brat
had something to do with it!

29:42.614 --> 29:45.325
MAN: You caused this mess,
Mayor. Do something!

29:45.408 --> 29:46.659
CONLEY:
Yeah, look!

29:46.743 --> 29:48.745
He draws it and then it happens!

29:48.828 --> 29:49.996
-MAN: Come on!
-Look!

29:50.079 --> 29:52.540
No, my son has nothing to do
with this.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.375
You know what,
you have been harassing him

29:54.459 --> 29:56.211
since all of these
changes started!

29:56.294 --> 29:57.462
BEAU:
He's blaming a kid!

29:57.545 --> 29:59.881
No! No, no, no!

29:59.964 --> 30:02.175
ANA: This is your mess--
now, you fix it!

30:02.258 --> 30:04.177
-(clamoring)
-No!

30:04.260 --> 30:07.055
(indistinct shouting)

30:13.978 --> 30:15.355
Hey! Hey! Hey!

30:15.438 --> 30:16.564
Stop!

30:16.648 --> 30:18.233
It was me!

30:18.316 --> 30:20.777
Okay?

30:20.860 --> 30:22.904
WOMAN:
What? No.

30:22.987 --> 30:25.240
JASON: I'm sorry everything's
gotten so out of hand.

30:25.323 --> 30:26.366
(all murmuring)

30:26.449 --> 30:28.284
You did this?

30:28.368 --> 30:31.579
The... the-the spider.

30:31.663 --> 30:33.414
The paint job.

30:33.498 --> 30:35.708
Yes.

30:36.876 --> 30:39.754
'Cause you weren't helping
the town, you were hurting it.

30:39.837 --> 30:42.090
I was just trying
to make things better.

30:44.175 --> 30:46.427
It was supposed to help.

30:46.511 --> 30:48.179
Okay?

30:49.973 --> 30:52.559
Things don't always go
like we plan.

30:53.351 --> 30:55.061
CONLEY:
Show us.

30:55.144 --> 30:56.563
MAN:
Yeah.

30:56.646 --> 30:58.106
WOMAN:
How did he do it?

30:58.189 --> 30:59.524
Um...

31:00.400 --> 31:02.527
Anybody got some matches?

31:04.487 --> 31:06.281
Here we go.

31:11.327 --> 31:13.204
(all gasping, exclaiming)

31:16.541 --> 31:20.253
Sorry, baby, I let you down.

31:21.504 --> 31:24.173
(grunts, pants)

31:24.257 --> 31:26.968
What the hell is that?

31:30.888 --> 31:33.266
So this is how
you've been doing it?

31:35.351 --> 31:37.812
I'm gonna fix the lights.
I just need a little time.

31:37.895 --> 31:41.316
"Fix the lights"?

31:41.399 --> 31:44.485
We can change the entire town.

31:44.569 --> 31:47.280
It'll be like a...

31:47.363 --> 31:48.323
a new Vegas.

31:48.406 --> 31:49.782
-Vegas?
-Yeah.

31:49.866 --> 31:52.201
(Conley laughing)

31:53.911 --> 31:55.330
How do you work this thing?

31:55.413 --> 31:57.081
I'm not gonna let you do that.

32:01.419 --> 32:02.920
"Let me"?

32:04.589 --> 32:06.758
Take it.

32:08.092 --> 32:11.262
Hey! Stop!
Get away from the model!

32:56.599 --> 32:58.726
JASON: Thank the Lord,
no serious injuries.

32:58.810 --> 33:01.604
But the property damage...

33:01.688 --> 33:03.064
Do you think we can fix it?

33:03.147 --> 33:05.024
The model? Nah.

33:05.108 --> 33:07.402
No, I don't think so.

33:07.485 --> 33:10.238
Feel like it wouldn't work
anymore anyway.

33:10.321 --> 33:12.573
I wasn't talking about no model.

broken things can be mended.

33:16.327 --> 33:18.579
