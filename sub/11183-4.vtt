00:26.693 --> 00:28.366
(Dominic) Can't we go up just a little?

00:28.428 --> 00:29.429
(Hawke) I can't.

00:29.496 --> 00:31.806
The Russians would pick us up on radar.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.609
(Hawke) My orders are to get you out.

00:35.669 --> 00:37.512
You would separate a man from his family?

00:37.571 --> 00:40.074
Hey, I'm not running a shuttle bus service.

00:45.112 --> 00:48.286
The odds are 50-50 that Hawke
is flying Airwolf into a trap.

00:48.348 --> 00:51.124
(Archangel) Hawke doesn't know the odds.

01:57.517 --> 01:59.895
[birds chirping]

02:42.629 --> 02:44.199
[rat squeals]

02:48.902 --> 02:51.382
[rat squealing]

04:05.946 --> 04:07.619
[chatters]

04:25.732 --> 04:27.143
[speaking Russian]

04:27.501 --> 04:29.276
[all chattering in Russian]

04:29.336 --> 04:30.508
Nyet.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.934
(Archangel) You may be his
only hope for escape.

04:58.064 --> 05:00.203
(Hawke) So you have other options?

05:00.267 --> 05:03.043
Of course. We could always invade Russia.

05:04.104 --> 05:07.142
Moses will make his way to that hunting cabin.

05:07.207 --> 05:09.312
It's in a remote section of the Urals,

05:09.342 --> 05:12.516
about 90 kilometers east of Sverdlovsk.

05:12.579 --> 05:15.651
Marella will give you precise
coordinates for Airwolf's computer.

05:15.715 --> 05:16.785
Moses?

05:16.850 --> 05:18.887
(Marella) If you'd read the
dossier, Stringfellow,

05:18.952 --> 05:21.057
instead of just looking
at all the pretty pictures,

05:21.121 --> 05:24.796
you would know that Vladimir
Rostoff's code name is Moses.

05:26.059 --> 05:27.299
[whines]

05:27.360 --> 05:28.361
Cute.

05:28.428 --> 05:29.463
Thank you.

05:29.529 --> 05:31.167
(Archangel) I don't think
either of you realizes

05:31.198 --> 05:33.644
the seriousness of the situation.

05:33.700 --> 05:34.804
Yes, sir.

05:34.868 --> 05:37.610
If Moses has blown his cover after 22 years,

05:37.671 --> 05:39.776
it has to be for something big.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.218
He's risen higher than we'd dared hope.

05:42.275 --> 05:44.721
Kept us out of at least a dozen small wars,

05:44.778 --> 05:47.258
and maybe, on a couple of
occasions, the big one.

05:47.314 --> 05:49.055
And now, he's thrown all that away

05:49.115 --> 05:50.389
and whatever it's worth

05:50.450 --> 05:54.159
so, you can bet it has to be
for something damn important.

05:57.924 --> 05:59.198
Who's this?

05:59.259 --> 06:01.500
Natalya and Tanya Rostoff.

06:02.295 --> 06:03.740
So, he's got a family?

06:03.797 --> 06:05.902
He's been there 22 years.

06:09.569 --> 06:11.344
I assume you've got a refueling tanker

06:11.404 --> 06:13.008
somewhere over the Norwegian basin.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.245
Yes.

06:15.408 --> 06:19.288
That's still a 3,000-mile round
trip through Russian airspace.

06:20.614 --> 06:23.652
Airwolf can make it, but not with 5 people.

06:25.418 --> 06:27.364
She can if you strip the armament.

06:27.420 --> 06:28.626
[Hawke laughs]

06:28.688 --> 06:32.465
You're asking me to fly Airwolf
into Russia without any guns?

06:33.159 --> 06:34.866
It's the only way.

06:34.961 --> 06:38.306
It's not exactly like pulling a
mole out of Indian territory.

06:38.365 --> 06:39.002
(Archangel) I told you.

06:39.032 --> 06:42.912
He's got something big
or he wouldn't be coming out.

06:44.271 --> 06:46.012
(Marella) Rostoff is no ordinary agent.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.983
On his first assignment he was decorated

06:48.041 --> 06:49.782
for saving the life of a fellow agent

06:49.843 --> 06:51.015
when the mission went sour.

06:51.077 --> 06:52.420
Marella.

06:53.914 --> 06:57.521
That agent's name is
Michael Goldsmith Briggs III.

06:57.951 --> 06:59.191
(Marella) Code named…

06:59.252 --> 07:00.731
Archangel.

07:00.987 --> 07:02.694
That has nothing to do with it.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.633
(Hawke) Of course not.

07:06.092 --> 07:07.537
Will you take the mission?

07:10.230 --> 07:11.732
"The Third,"?

07:14.234 --> 07:16.908
I wouldn't throw stones, Stringfellow.

07:37.357 --> 07:38.461
(Marella) Sir,

07:38.525 --> 07:40.630
could I play devil's advocate for a moment?

07:40.694 --> 07:42.105
(Archangel) I encourage it.

07:42.162 --> 07:44.164
Well, some of our sister agencies suspect

07:44.230 --> 07:46.369
that we're in liaison with Hawke and Airwolf

07:46.433 --> 07:48.936
They haven't been able to prove it.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.072
No, sir.

07:50.136 --> 07:52.673
But you can be sure that if they
suspect, so do the Russians.

07:52.739 --> 07:54.844
And that this might possibly be

07:54.908 --> 07:58.014
an elaborate effort by the
Soviets to capture Airwolf

07:58.078 --> 08:01.651
Anything is possible,
but it's not very probable.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.523
I agree, unless one of two things has happened.

08:04.584 --> 08:07.690
1 - the Soviets have uncovered
Moses and are using him.

08:07.754 --> 08:09.893
Giving him something that
he thinks is so important

08:09.956 --> 08:11.765
he's got to bring us in to extract him.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.736
No. If the KGB uncovered him,

08:13.793 --> 08:15.500
they wouldn't risk his slipping away

08:15.562 --> 08:17.439
in a ruse to capture Airwolf

08:17.497 --> 08:18.703
2 -

08:20.367 --> 08:23.075
he's been living in Russia for over 20 years.

08:23.136 --> 08:25.639
He's got a wife, daughter, friends.

08:25.705 --> 08:27.480
He may have turned.

08:28.274 --> 08:30.254
I didn't say you would like it.

08:30.310 --> 08:32.051
I think it stinks.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.486
Yes, sir.

08:39.652 --> 08:42.565
(Archangel) I assume you've
run these scenarios of yours

08:42.621 --> 08:44.363
through the computer?

08:44.424 --> 08:46.404
(Marella) Yes, sir. I took the statistics

08:46.459 --> 08:48.336
from all our counterintelligence agencies,

08:48.395 --> 08:49.874
both foreign and domestic,

08:49.929 --> 08:52.136
who operate deep undercover agents.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.838
I cross-referenced them
with those that have turned

08:54.901 --> 08:57.006
and added the psychological probability

08:57.070 --> 08:59.209
of change due to midlife crisis,

08:59.272 --> 09:01.252
sexual promiscuity, children reaching…

09:01.307 --> 09:04.117
Damn it, Marella, what's the bottom line?

09:06.780 --> 09:08.453
The odds are 50-50

09:08.515 --> 09:11.291
that Hawke is flying Airwolf into a trap.

09:32.639 --> 09:34.915
(Dominic) It's the stupidest
plan I ever heard.

09:34.974 --> 09:37.477
(Dominic) Some Russky out hunting
bear with a bow and arrow

09:37.544 --> 09:38.682
could bring us down.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.884
(Hawke) They'd better have
armor-piercing arrows.

09:40.947 --> 09:43.086
Oh, you know what I mean.

09:43.183 --> 09:44.719
Yeah. You don't like the plan.

09:44.784 --> 09:46.991
[exclaims] I think it stinks.

09:47.053 --> 09:48.191
You got a better one?

09:48.254 --> 09:50.894
You bet. Let's not go at all.

09:50.957 --> 09:53.801
[both laughing]

10:00.533 --> 10:02.672
[vehicle approaching]

10:10.743 --> 10:12.188
[Dominic sighs]

10:12.245 --> 10:14.782
No matter how many times I see her,

10:14.914 --> 10:17.224
she still takes my breath away.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.360
Yeah.

10:32.065 --> 10:33.100
[clicking]

10:33.166 --> 10:34.702
[gauges beep]

10:34.801 --> 10:36.838
[engine whirring]

10:36.936 --> 10:39.746
[beeping]

10:43.443 --> 10:44.444
[beeping]

11:37.964 --> 11:40.001
(pilot) $10 it's an SR-71.

11:41.067 --> 11:42.808
(co-pilot) Harrier Jet.

11:42.869 --> 11:43.904
(pilot) What the hell would we be doing

11:43.937 --> 11:46.975
refueling a Harrier within
spitting distance of Russia?

11:47.040 --> 11:49.179
I don't know the mission.
I just know it's a Harrier.

11:49.242 --> 11:52.223
Why else would we be using
a straight line refueling rig?

11:52.278 --> 11:55.225
An SR-71 uses a straight line refueling rig.

11:56.516 --> 11:58.291
I didn't know that.

11:58.751 --> 12:01.163
That's why you're gonna lose $10.

12:02.488 --> 12:04.399
(Tembrusco) Captain, I… I…

12:04.457 --> 12:07.870
(Tembrusco) I have an… an
aircraft approaching for hookup.

12:07.927 --> 12:09.668
(pilot) What is it?

12:09.729 --> 12:12.608
(Tembrusco) I'd rather not say, sir.

12:34.387 --> 12:35.923
(Dominic) According to the computer,

12:35.989 --> 12:38.993
we'll be penetrating Soviet
airspace in 6 minutes.

12:39.058 --> 12:40.594
(Hawke) Right.

12:41.060 --> 12:43.131
That's all you got to say?

12:43.863 --> 12:45.035
For now.

12:46.332 --> 12:48.539
We're going on the deck the rest of the way.

12:50.303 --> 12:52.408
I was afraid it'd be something like that.

12:52.472 --> 12:53.815
[snorts]

12:53.906 --> 12:56.216
What do you call "on the deck"?

12:56.909 --> 12:59.719
(Hawke) About 50 feet. Give or take a few.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.781
It ain't the 50 feet I'm worried about.

13:01.848 --> 13:03.759
It's the give or take.

13:03.816 --> 13:05.557
[beeping]

13:08.588 --> 13:10.534
(Dominic) I got 2 bogies, Angels 30.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.695
(Dominic) Closing fast on a heading of 015.

13:12.759 --> 13:14.238
(Hawke) MiGs?

13:21.834 --> 13:23.438
(Dominic) MiG 23s.

13:23.503 --> 13:25.449
Hey, I thought this was Finland.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.542
I don't think the Soviets
pay too much attention

13:27.607 --> 13:29.416
to road signs around their borders.

13:29.475 --> 13:30.510
Hang on.

14:06.245 --> 14:08.282
They're directly overhead.

14:08.348 --> 14:09.725
Altitude?

14:10.083 --> 14:11.494
(Dominic) Angels 30.

14:11.551 --> 14:14.225
(Dominic) I'm absorbing
90% of their radar scans.

14:14.287 --> 14:17.928
(Dominic) They're maintaining
altitude. Heading northeast.

14:17.990 --> 14:21.335
(Dominic) Hey, I don't think
they spotted us, String.

14:29.936 --> 14:32.940
When the sun goes down here,
it really goes down, huh?

14:33.005 --> 14:35.007
(Hawke) It comes up just as fast.

14:35.074 --> 14:38.248
We have about 8 hours this time of the year.

14:38.745 --> 14:41.817
3 in, 3 out, and 2 to pick Moses up.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.589
(Dominic) Maybe less.

14:44.984 --> 14:47.396
(Dominic) Those MiGs are
descending and coming back.

14:47.453 --> 14:50.024
Now, why would they do a thing like that?

14:50.089 --> 14:52.626
Well, Dom, they might've spotted us.

15:11.978 --> 15:15.152
(Dominic) They're climbing.
I think they lost us.

15:18.885 --> 15:21.889
Oh, my God, nobody can fly blind this low.

15:22.054 --> 15:23.226
(Hawke) I know.

15:23.289 --> 15:24.563
Then pull up.

15:24.624 --> 15:27.195
I can't. The Russians would
pick us up on radar.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.740
It's better than in little pieces.

15:33.866 --> 15:36.312
(Dominic) Oh, String, this is nuts.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.076
Those MiGs gone?

15:38.137 --> 15:40.310
Yeah, moving off the grid to the north.

15:40.373 --> 15:43.616
Tum on my helmet view. It's the CC panel.

15:46.312 --> 15:48.383
[machine humming]

15:48.981 --> 15:51.552
(Dominic) Mamma mia! What is that?

15:51.617 --> 15:53.255
(Hawke) SLAS.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.664
StarLight Amplification System.

15:57.156 --> 15:59.932
It amplifies available light a million times.

15:59.992 --> 16:01.630
Turns night into day.

16:01.694 --> 16:03.799
Oh, that's great, String.

16:03.863 --> 16:05.843
But now that the MiGs are gone,

16:05.898 --> 16:08.139
can't we go up just a little?

16:09.535 --> 16:12.015
Yeah, I guess we can ease up a few feet.

16:12.071 --> 16:13.482
Thank you.

16:26.185 --> 16:28.358
(Archangel) Well, if they
haven't snagged a snowdrift

16:28.421 --> 16:30.492
or been run over by a herd of reindeer,

16:30.556 --> 16:33.093
they should be approaching
that cabin just about now.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.331
Then one way or another

16:34.393 --> 16:35.997
we should know what's happening soon.

16:36.062 --> 16:38.064
We won't, but they will.

16:38.865 --> 16:40.708
(Marella) Knightsbridge, this is Angel 1.

16:40.766 --> 16:42.803
(Marella) I'm 5 miles out over the main gate.

16:42.869 --> 16:45.042
(Marella) Request a Jericho
approach to the pad.

16:45.104 --> 16:46.742
(controller) Angel 1. Knightsbridge.

16:46.806 --> 16:49.013
Approach approved. You are cleared to land.

17:30.683 --> 17:32.253
(Dominic) According to the computer,

17:32.318 --> 17:34.525
we're within 10 kilometers of the cabin.

17:34.587 --> 17:36.863
(Dominic) No, wait. You better slow down.

17:36.923 --> 17:39.403
We're 4… 3… 2… 1…

17:43.863 --> 17:47.003
String, I got a heat source
at 3 o'clock 100 meters up.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.101
Could be human.

17:48.167 --> 17:50.078
(Hawke) Hit the lights.

18:03.249 --> 18:04.887
Invite him into the clearing.

18:04.951 --> 18:06.055
(Dominic) Right.

18:08.654 --> 18:11.362
[computer beeping]

18:17.863 --> 18:21.106
(Dominic) Hey, see if you can
get him to look up, will you?

18:21.300 --> 18:22.643
[thudding]

18:24.003 --> 18:25.346
I said get him to look up,

18:25.404 --> 18:27.042
not scare the hell out of me.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.143
Sorry. Is it him?

18:30.209 --> 18:32.382
(Dominic) A little older, but it's him.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.789
You got any other heat sources?

18:36.215 --> 18:37.319
Nope.

18:37.383 --> 18:38.418
That's too bad.

18:38.484 --> 18:40.623
Why, you looking for trouble?

18:40.686 --> 18:42.688
No. But if Rostoff's bringing his family out,

18:42.755 --> 18:46.225
there ought to be 2 other heat
sources somewhere in the area.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.832
[gauges beep]

19:32.571 --> 19:33.845
Rostoff?

19:40.880 --> 19:43.156
I came to take you home, Moses.

19:46.452 --> 19:48.591
I thought you were Soviet military.

19:48.654 --> 19:50.327
Why, are they hunting you?

19:50.389 --> 19:51.959
I must assume so.

19:52.024 --> 19:54.436
They may have deduced by
now it was no accident.

19:54.493 --> 19:55.631
What?

19:55.728 --> 19:58.436
I've been without sleep for 3 days.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.136
My thinking is a bit muddled.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.941
I stole a biological weapon

20:03.002 --> 20:06.006
and covered the theft by creating an accident,

20:06.072 --> 20:07.745
a fatal accident.

20:08.107 --> 20:10.348
Some of them were my friends.

20:15.614 --> 20:17.059
It must be some weapon.

20:17.116 --> 20:18.254
It is.

20:18.317 --> 20:20.797
Air carried. Lethal in 2 seconds.

20:20.853 --> 20:23.493
Totally undetectable and untraceable.

20:23.656 --> 20:26.068
The only deterrent is for
both sides to have it

20:26.125 --> 20:28.503
then each will fear retaliation.

20:30.362 --> 20:32.205
Archangel was right.

20:32.631 --> 20:34.838
You are an exceptional man.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.238
How is Michael?

20:37.870 --> 20:40.180
Oh, he's a little the worse for wear

20:40.239 --> 20:41.582
but he's still recruiting the most beautiful

20:41.607 --> 20:44.781
and intelligent women in the world.

20:45.211 --> 20:48.124
I used to think that would be his downfall.

20:48.547 --> 20:51.050
Now I think it may be his strength.

20:51.517 --> 20:52.723
We gotta get going.

20:52.785 --> 20:54.389
Yes, of course.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.131
Where is your family?

20:58.224 --> 21:00.966
They're waiting at Kirivitz,
200 kilometers east of here.

21:01.026 --> 21:03.302
Hey, I'm not running
a shuttle bus service.

21:03.362 --> 21:06.172
I didn't know how long it would
take the Firm to extract me.

21:06.232 --> 21:08.769
I couldn't risk my family
being caught here with me.

21:08.834 --> 21:10.711
My orders are to get you out.

21:10.770 --> 21:13.580
You would separate a man from his family?

21:13.739 --> 21:15.047
If I had to.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.211
Yes.

21:16.275 --> 21:19.017
That's why I left the serum
I stole with my wife.

21:42.101 --> 21:44.240
Your helicopter, it's incredible.

21:44.303 --> 21:45.782
Mach 1 plus.

21:45.838 --> 21:47.681
(Rostoff) We have nothing like this.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.117
(Dominic) What do you mean "we"?

21:49.175 --> 21:51.018
I mean the Soviets.

21:51.076 --> 21:53.283
IR jamming. Automatic defense system.

21:53.345 --> 21:54.415
Stealth mode.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.460
(Rostoff) A choice of 14 offensive weapons.

21:56.515 --> 21:57.516
[chuckling] We wish.

21:57.583 --> 21:58.891
We had to strip the guns to…

21:58.951 --> 22:00.726
(Hawke) Dom.

22:01.086 --> 22:03.327
(Hawke) Have you got that readout on Kirivitz?

22:03.389 --> 22:04.868
Of course.

22:04.924 --> 22:06.733
You had to trade weight for fuel.

22:06.992 --> 22:09.302
You have nothing to shoot with, do you?

22:10.896 --> 22:13.308
I always save a little something.

22:20.005 --> 22:21.348
Kirivitz.

22:24.777 --> 22:27.155
(Dominic) Agra community. 1,200 people.

22:27.213 --> 22:29.819
62 degrees north, 51 degrees west.

22:30.816 --> 22:32.955
My family will be at my
wife's brother's farm,

22:33.018 --> 22:34.429
north of the village.

22:34.486 --> 22:35.863
Hey, String.

22:35.921 --> 22:37.730
There's a Soviet missile complex

22:37.790 --> 22:38.962
all around Kirivitz.

22:39.024 --> 22:41.561
It's gotta have more security than Fort Knox.

22:41.627 --> 22:43.698
The missiles were removed 3 months ago.

22:43.762 --> 22:45.969
(Rostoff) Those silos are empty
and so are the barracks.

22:46.031 --> 22:48.307
(Rostoff) It's part of the air
defense rotation program.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.472
(Dominic) Yeah, but that's
not what the computer says.

22:50.536 --> 22:52.345
Then the computer is wrong.

22:52.404 --> 22:54.941
Archangel gave us the latest
tapes for this mission.

22:55.007 --> 22:57.988
Then there is obviously an intelligence lag.

22:58.344 --> 22:59.982
Or you're lying.

23:08.187 --> 23:09.757
[owl hooting]

23:10.289 --> 23:11.666
[crickets chirping]

23:11.724 --> 23:15.297
[men chattering in Russian]

23:20.532 --> 23:24.105
[aircraft approaching]

23:24.270 --> 23:26.147
(Rostoff) We are how far from the farmhouse?

23:26.205 --> 23:27.684
(Dominic) 10,000 meters.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.083
Amazing.

23:30.576 --> 23:32.146
(Dominic) I count 5 people.

23:32.211 --> 23:34.452
(Rostoff) My family and
Turgyev's wife and son.

23:34.513 --> 23:35.583
What do you think, Dom?

23:35.648 --> 23:36.683
(Dominic) Why ask me now?

23:36.749 --> 23:39.821
I don't think we should've have
taken this job in the first place.

23:39.885 --> 23:42.024
I think we should have
gone home from the cabin.

23:42.087 --> 23:44.033
And I think we're walking right into a trap.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.330
And I think that you're gonna
do whatever you're gonna do

23:46.392 --> 23:47.462
no matter what I think.

23:47.526 --> 23:48.971
So why you asking me what I think?

23:49.028 --> 23:50.166
(Hawke) Hey, sorry.

23:50.729 --> 23:52.766
(Rostoff) There is a missile
silo a mile to the west

23:52.831 --> 23:54.367
and another a mile and a half south.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.435
They're both connected to the
road that's in front of the farm.

23:56.468 --> 23:59.039
As I said, they are empty,
so, you can take your pick.

23:59.104 --> 24:00.174
Dom?

24:00.239 --> 24:03.220
(Dominic) Now, let's see.
I've got a small clearing,

24:03.275 --> 24:05.346
big enough, but not too big.

24:05.411 --> 24:06.981
There's a creek that runs through it

24:07.046 --> 24:09.356
to the farm about 1,500 meters

24:09.415 --> 24:11.292
on a heading of 215.

24:11.650 --> 24:12.890
Okay.

24:35.574 --> 24:38.646
[men chattering in Russian]

24:40.779 --> 24:42.918
[continue chattering]

24:54.727 --> 24:58.539
[man singing in Russian]

25:03.035 --> 25:04.207
[door shuts]

25:09.141 --> 25:11.781
[singing continues]

25:11.844 --> 25:12.982
(Dominic) Nice, huh?

25:13.045 --> 25:14.991
(Rostoff) Turgyev has a great voice.

25:15.047 --> 25:17.527
He used to sing in the army choir.

25:17.716 --> 25:19.889
[humming]

25:19.952 --> 25:22.262
Kind of catchy. Where've I heard that before?

25:22.321 --> 25:25.530
It's a song of bloodshed,
of struggle, of glory.

25:25.724 --> 25:27.260
A song of the Revolution.

25:27.359 --> 25:28.667
[Turgyev continues singing]

25:28.727 --> 25:31.071
Revolu… Oh, now I remember.

25:31.130 --> 25:34.236
You mean I've been humming a Communist song?

25:34.299 --> 25:37.803
Think of it as a Russian
version of Yankee Doodle Dandy.

25:38.103 --> 25:41.676
[Turgyev continues singing]

25:43.542 --> 25:46.352
Hey, hold on a minute, let's have a look.

25:48.180 --> 25:50.251
[crickets chirping]

25:56.722 --> 25:59.498
[singing continues]

26:12.171 --> 26:13.844
Just your family, huh?

26:13.906 --> 26:15.647
(Rostoff) Turgyev's in the local militia.

26:15.707 --> 26:16.742
They must be his friends.

26:16.809 --> 26:17.913
(Dominic) Oh, really?

26:17.976 --> 26:19.284
Probably on a routine patrol

26:19.344 --> 26:21.654
checking the empty missile silos.

26:21.980 --> 26:23.653
(Rostoff) To guard against vandalism.

26:23.715 --> 26:25.251
With AK-47s?

26:25.517 --> 26:27.690
- I'll get rid of them.
- (Hawke) No.

26:28.253 --> 26:30.733
You yourself said we were on a tight schedule.

26:30.789 --> 26:33.531
Did you ever think that maybe
your accident has been discovered

26:33.592 --> 26:35.265
and they're here to pick you up?

26:35.327 --> 26:38.308
They don't send the local
militia for that, Mr. Hawke.

26:38.363 --> 26:39.808
(Hawke) Hey.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.579
[gun clicks]

26:44.369 --> 26:45.939
Shoot me and you lose the serum.

26:46.004 --> 26:47.005
[gun cocking]

26:47.072 --> 26:48.949
And you lose your life.

26:53.011 --> 26:55.355
[thunder rumbling]

26:55.414 --> 26:57.519
(Marella) The 1800 situation report is in.

26:58.383 --> 26:59.521
Well?

27:01.987 --> 27:03.796
There's unusual Soviet air activity

27:03.856 --> 27:05.699
near the Manchurian border.

27:05.757 --> 27:07.998
Over 2,000 miles from Airwolf.

27:09.394 --> 27:11.431
A satellite was launched at 1200 Zulu time

27:11.497 --> 27:13.499
from their space center at Baikonur.

27:13.565 --> 27:14.737
Orbit?

27:14.800 --> 27:15.938
North-south elliptical,

27:16.001 --> 27:17.776
covering England, France, Italy.

27:17.836 --> 27:21.340
They're beefing up their M.R.
missile spotting network.

27:21.406 --> 27:23.977
Armored activity near Polish border.

27:24.409 --> 27:26.616
There was a work stoppage at Lodz yesterday.

27:26.678 --> 27:29.659
The Russians are just flexing their muscles.

27:29.715 --> 27:32.252
And the rest was on the 1200 report.

27:34.219 --> 27:35.493
What is it?

27:35.554 --> 27:38.296
An update in the communication section.

27:38.357 --> 27:40.735
“increased radio traffic on KGB frequencies”

27:40.792 --> 27:43.102
“throughout the central Urals.”

27:46.098 --> 27:48.772
“Specifically in the Sverdlovsk area.”

27:50.736 --> 27:53.148
It's beginning to look
like you could be right.

27:56.842 --> 27:57.912
[balalaika playing]

27:57.976 --> 27:59.785
(Dominic) Hmm, beautiful.

27:59.845 --> 28:03.486
(Dominic) Sounds like one of
them sad Italian arias, huh?

28:03.649 --> 28:05.560
(Rostoff) It's a song about a young couple

28:05.617 --> 28:07.494
who die of unrequited love.

28:07.553 --> 28:08.623
[man singing]

28:08.687 --> 28:09.961
Romeo and Juliet.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.399
[laughs]

28:11.790 --> 28:13.895
This was sung on the steppes of Russia

28:13.959 --> 28:16.405
long before Shakespeare was born.

28:16.695 --> 28:19.198
He probably stole the idea from us.

28:19.831 --> 28:22.334
There you go with that "us" again.

28:22.834 --> 28:24.871
I am Russian, Mr. Santini.

28:26.538 --> 28:28.814
I thought you were an American.

28:28.874 --> 28:31.480
I was born in a coal-mining
town in Pennsylvania,

28:31.543 --> 28:33.216
of Russian parents.

28:33.278 --> 28:36.225
I was rocked to sleep to Russian lullabies.

28:36.281 --> 28:38.887
I celebrated Christmas on January 5.

28:39.585 --> 28:42.259
Prayed to God in a Russian Orthodox church.

28:42.321 --> 28:45.666
And when I fell in love,
it was with a Russian girl.

28:47.059 --> 28:50.302
I am American by birth
and political conviction.

28:51.163 --> 28:54.235
But my heart and soul is Russian.

28:54.700 --> 28:56.805
[crickets chirping]

30:15.580 --> 30:19.858
[speaking Russian]

30:20.419 --> 30:22.592
(Hawke) Hey, enough of this.

30:23.889 --> 30:25.800
Rostoff, we don't have time for this.

30:25.857 --> 30:27.837
You should have told your daughter earlier.

30:27.893 --> 30:29.600
(Tanya) Yes. You should have.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.265
Hey, she speaks English.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.936
And French and Italian. We are not ignorant.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.009
[speaking French] Excuse me.

30:36.335 --> 30:38.713
[speaking Russian]

30:38.770 --> 30:40.647
If you speak English, speak English.

30:40.706 --> 30:41.980
Nyet!

30:42.307 --> 30:43.843
I don't think she likes us, String.

30:43.909 --> 30:45.354
Neither do I.

30:45.410 --> 30:48.016
(Hawke) In your place I
wouldn't like us much, either.

30:48.080 --> 30:49.184
But the reality is,

30:49.247 --> 30:51.488
your husband has to leave
Russia or he's gonna be shot.

30:51.550 --> 30:52.551
Nyet.

30:52.617 --> 30:53.687
Da.

30:53.752 --> 30:55.026
[speaking Russian]

30:56.355 --> 30:59.598
[speaking Russian]

31:00.692 --> 31:02.433
[speaking Russian]

31:02.594 --> 31:04.164
[Natalya speaking Russian]

31:04.229 --> 31:06.800
[speaking Russian]

31:07.065 --> 31:09.568
[speaking Russian]

31:10.102 --> 31:11.979
English, please.

31:12.170 --> 31:14.343
(Natalya) My brother does not speak English.

31:14.406 --> 31:17.046
Then he's excused. The rest of you aren't.

31:17.109 --> 31:19.020
Have you got that serum?

31:21.079 --> 31:22.649
In the bedroom.

31:23.482 --> 31:24.722
Hold on a minute.

31:24.783 --> 31:26.729
You say your brother-in-law's in the militia,

31:26.785 --> 31:27.923
where does he keep his gun?

31:27.986 --> 31:29.829
Also in the bedroom.

31:29.921 --> 31:30.991
Dom.

31:31.056 --> 31:32.467
Yeah, sure.

31:36.561 --> 31:39.041
[Tanya speaking Russian]

31:39.097 --> 31:40.474
(Hawke) Tanya, I like your spunk

31:40.532 --> 31:43.741
but if you don't start speaking
English I'm gonna spank your butt.

31:49.207 --> 31:51.278
(Rostoff) Stop it, Tanya.

31:51.543 --> 31:53.250
(Rostoff) I'm doing what I feel I must.

31:53.311 --> 31:56.315
Not for America, for people.
For Russians and Americans.

31:56.381 --> 31:58.292
[speaking Russian]

32:01.787 --> 32:03.858
By betraying our country?

32:03.922 --> 32:05.868
It's not a simple matter of betrayal.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.904
It seems simple to me.

32:08.527 --> 32:10.370
That's because you are young and naive.

32:10.429 --> 32:11.806
Perhaps.

32:11.963 --> 32:15.968
But I am old enough to know that
I will not betray my country.

32:18.637 --> 32:20.048
Nor I mine.

32:22.207 --> 32:24.278
But Russia is your country.

32:24.342 --> 32:26.788
No, Tanya. Russia is my heritage.

32:26.845 --> 32:28.483
The United States is my country

32:28.547 --> 32:30.151
and I took an oath to protect it,

32:30.215 --> 32:32.320
even if it cost me my life.

32:37.122 --> 32:40.626
[helicopter approaching]

32:45.697 --> 32:47.643
(Hawke) I suppose it's just the local militia

32:47.699 --> 32:49.303
dropping by for some tea?

32:49.367 --> 32:51.745
(Rostoff) They know the
lab was not an accident.

32:52.571 --> 32:54.573
(Dominic) Is it Russian?

32:54.806 --> 32:56.513
(Dominic) Never mind.

32:56.608 --> 32:57.848
[helicopter whirring]

32:57.909 --> 33:00.651
(Rostoff) We can try for your
helicopter if one of us decoys them.

33:00.712 --> 33:02.817
[Natalya yells in Russian]

33:19.498 --> 33:21.603
[grunting]

33:23.101 --> 33:27.049
[pilot shouting in Russian]

33:30.575 --> 33:32.577
[pilot continues shouting in Russian]

33:32.644 --> 33:35.250
(pilot speaking English)
Do not move or I will shoot.

33:37.382 --> 33:40.488
[pilot shouting in Russian]

33:44.523 --> 33:47.265
On the count of 3, douse that light.

33:47.526 --> 33:48.834
And you get that lamp.

33:48.894 --> 33:50.669
And then hide behind that stove.

33:50.729 --> 33:51.901
- You ready?
- Da.

33:51.963 --> 33:53.135
1…

33:53.698 --> 33:55.109
(Dominic) 2…

33:55.166 --> 33:56.474
[glass breaking]

33:56.535 --> 33:57.707
(Dominic) 3…

33:57.769 --> 34:01.114
[Natalya and Tanya sobbing]

34:03.141 --> 34:05.052
[women screaming]

34:13.552 --> 34:14.792
(Dominic) Anybody hit?

34:14.853 --> 34:15.888
(Rostoff) No.

34:15.954 --> 34:17.489
[Rostoff speaking Russian]

34:17.556 --> 34:19.364
(Hawke) Don't shoot.

34:21.960 --> 34:24.496
(Dominic) If my reflexes
were just a little faster,

34:24.563 --> 34:26.543
you'd have been a dead bunny.

34:26.598 --> 34:28.304
I was counting on that.

34:28.366 --> 34:29.844
(Dominic) T… Turgyev?

34:29.900 --> 34:31.676
(Hawke) He's okay.

34:32.003 --> 34:33.846
(Hawke) Took off toward the road, I think.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.043
[helicopter whirring]

34:35.106 --> 34:36.176
(Rostoff) What is it?

34:36.241 --> 34:37.311
(Hawke) Get down!

34:37.375 --> 34:38.945
[guns firing]

34:40.011 --> 34:41.717
[women screaming]

34:47.085 --> 34:48.962
[helicopter receding]

34:49.020 --> 34:50.693
He's not trying to kill us.

34:50.755 --> 34:52.962
Yeah? You couldn't prove it by me.

34:53.024 --> 34:54.935
No, he's shooting high.

34:55.159 --> 34:56.696
Or trying to keep us pinned down

34:56.761 --> 34:58.331
till they get ground support.

34:58.997 --> 35:01.204
We'll have to decoy him to get out of here.

35:01.266 --> 35:03.371
(Rostoff) I will do it if
you will get my family out.

35:03.435 --> 35:04.846
No, Papa. No!

35:04.903 --> 35:06.940
We will not go without you.

35:07.072 --> 35:11.953
[Rostoff speaking Russian]

35:12.110 --> 35:13.180
Nyet!

35:13.244 --> 35:15.155
[sobbing] Nyet.

35:15.714 --> 35:17.887
(Hawke) Hey, Moses, I don't
know what they're saying,

35:17.949 --> 35:20.259
but it sounds like "no" to me.

35:20.585 --> 35:22.690
I'm not gonna haul 2 screaming, kicking women

35:22.754 --> 35:24.791
through the woods in the dark.

35:24.856 --> 35:26.392
Not when there's another way.

35:26.458 --> 35:28.096
What other way?

35:28.159 --> 35:31.299
Hey, she ain't got no guns, remember?

35:32.564 --> 35:34.271
[glass breaking]

35:34.332 --> 35:36.039
[women screaming]

35:38.203 --> 35:41.548
[bullets ricocheting]

35:42.841 --> 35:44.843
And in case you hadn't noticed,

35:44.909 --> 35:46.286
he does.

35:46.778 --> 35:49.622
Yeah, well, I figure that'll
just about make it even.

35:49.681 --> 35:51.285
[guns firing]

35:51.349 --> 35:53.056
[women screaming]

35:59.090 --> 36:01.798
[clock ticking]

36:05.664 --> 36:07.666
(Marella) Do you want something to eat?

36:11.069 --> 36:12.173
What?

36:12.270 --> 36:14.113
Can I get you a sandwich or some hot soup?

36:14.172 --> 36:15.276
I could send to…

36:15.340 --> 36:17.445
Oh, no, no, thank you, no.

36:21.079 --> 36:23.320
Oh, not yet, please, Marella.

36:23.982 --> 36:26.121
I wanna enjoy the sunset.

36:33.158 --> 36:34.535
I'm sorry.

36:34.759 --> 36:36.102
For what?

36:37.796 --> 36:39.298
For being right.

36:39.364 --> 36:41.674
Don't write this mission off yet.

36:41.733 --> 36:44.077
But it's sunrise over the Urals.

36:44.135 --> 36:47.309
Hawke was supposed to
rendezvous with the tanker

36:47.672 --> 36:49.310
15 minutes ago.

36:51.109 --> 36:54.886
That doesn't mean he's
failed. Just that he's late.

36:55.246 --> 36:57.954
Sir, if I were to put this mission
through my computer right now,

36:58.016 --> 37:00.155
the odds would be a 1,000-to-1 against it.

37:00.218 --> 37:01.720
Probably higher.

37:01.786 --> 37:04.392
But we've got one thing going for us.

37:05.090 --> 37:06.125
What?

37:06.191 --> 37:08.364
Hawke doesn't know the odds.

37:28.213 --> 37:29.556
(Rostoff) He must hate me.

37:29.614 --> 37:31.093
(Dominic) Who, Turgyev?

37:31.149 --> 37:32.389
No.

37:32.817 --> 37:35.457
Not the way he greeted you last night.

37:36.321 --> 37:39.165
Oh, he… he may be hurt and angry.

37:40.258 --> 37:41.464
But given time,

37:41.526 --> 37:43.938
he'll remember all the
good things between you.

37:44.863 --> 37:47.002
You say you sang together?

37:47.265 --> 37:48.835
All the time.

37:49.467 --> 37:50.946
(Rostoff) Our families used to say

37:51.002 --> 37:52.982
we drove them crazy, but they loved it.

37:53.037 --> 37:54.607
(Rostoff) Especially the children.

37:54.672 --> 37:56.743
(Dominic) He'll remember.

37:56.841 --> 37:58.616
[birds chirping]

37:59.077 --> 38:01.523
You're a philosopher, Mr. Santini.

38:01.746 --> 38:03.953
Me? No.

38:05.016 --> 38:07.053
I've just lived a little.

38:14.025 --> 38:15.800
And I'd like to continue.

38:22.600 --> 38:25.046
I wonder what the hell he's up to.

38:53.198 --> 38:54.541
(Rostoff) It is over.

38:54.599 --> 38:56.010
No, we ain't finished yet.

38:56.067 --> 38:58.513
At least he got out with the serum.

38:58.570 --> 39:01.050
What are you talking about? Hawke?

39:01.940 --> 39:05.285
Of course. He did what he had
to do, get the serum back.

39:05.343 --> 39:07.721
Yeah, well, you don't know Hawke.

39:16.120 --> 39:17.394
I'm gonna teach you

39:17.455 --> 39:20.231
to sit up there and make life miserable.

39:51.456 --> 39:53.367
[laughing]

40:09.674 --> 40:11.278
[whooping]

40:23.288 --> 40:26.929
[chattering in Russian]

40:46.744 --> 40:48.621
(Dominic) Who needs guns?

40:48.680 --> 40:50.091
[Dominic laughing]

40:58.456 --> 41:00.060
Get in! Get in!

41:01.626 --> 41:04.197
[guns firing]

41:10.568 --> 41:12.912
[guns continue firing]

42:41.492 --> 42:44.371
(pilot) I still can't
figure Sergeant Tembrusco.

42:44.429 --> 42:47.876
He's flown on and off as my
crew chief for 5 years.

42:48.599 --> 42:51.375
I've never seen him act so weird before.

42:51.636 --> 42:53.377
Maybe that's why.

42:54.439 --> 42:55.782
I don't follow you.

42:55.840 --> 42:57.945
Well, he knows it's a Harrier.

42:58.009 --> 43:00.819
He just didn't want you to lose the bet.

43:00.978 --> 43:03.959
It was not a Harrier. It was an SR-71.

43:04.015 --> 43:06.427
Then why didn't Tembrusco say so?

43:06.484 --> 43:08.486
I don't know. Something's wrong.

43:08.553 --> 43:10.692
(pilot) This is the first
flight he's missed since…

43:10.755 --> 43:11.927
(Munga) Captain Nuzo,

43:11.989 --> 43:14.526
I have an aircraft approaching for hookup.

43:16.360 --> 43:17.668
Same bet?

43:18.563 --> 43:19.940
You're on.

43:20.298 --> 43:22.574
Airman, what's your name, son?

43:22.934 --> 43:24.914
Airman Munga, sir.

43:25.603 --> 43:28.174
What kind of aircraft is that, Munga?

43:28.473 --> 43:30.043
Type, sir?

43:30.475 --> 43:32.819
That's right, Airman. What type?

43:33.478 --> 43:36.049
(Munga) It's a helicopter, sir.

43:37.949 --> 43:39.986
Where'd you get this guy?

43:41.619 --> 43:43.360
[birds chirping]

43:46.657 --> 43:49.797
[clock ticking]

43:51.963 --> 43:53.033
I was wrong.

43:53.097 --> 43:54.838
Hmm? What?

44:00.705 --> 44:02.241
0600 Zulu.

44:02.306 --> 44:04.513
Aircraft linkup with refueling tanker Tango

44:04.575 --> 44:08.489
over the Norwegian basin 0547 confirmed.

44:08.546 --> 44:10.890
[laughing] Hawke did it!

44:11.182 --> 44:12.820
Yeah, try to control yourself.

44:12.884 --> 44:13.954
Yes, sir.

44:14.018 --> 44:17.465
You're acting like a trainee on
her first mission instead of…

44:17.522 --> 44:19.297
[whoops] He did it!

44:20.925 --> 44:22.029
All right.

44:22.260 --> 44:24.672
[wind whistling]

44:25.997 --> 44:28.068
(Dominic) I haven't had
halupkis since I was a kid.

44:28.132 --> 44:29.634
(Dominic) And my friend Milo's Mom,

44:29.700 --> 44:31.771
they were Russian, too, she made it for me.

44:31.836 --> 44:33.713
A… and then there was a special soup

44:33.771 --> 44:35.307
that she used to make for Christmas.

44:35.373 --> 44:38.377
With, pasta and, little meatballs.

44:39.577 --> 44:41.557
(Natalya) I never heard of that.

44:41.612 --> 44:43.091
(Dominic) Oh?

44:43.447 --> 44:45.427
Well, maybe that was Ling Soo's Mom.

44:45.483 --> 44:47.053
They were Chinese, you know.

44:47.118 --> 44:48.563
[all laugh]

44:49.654 --> 44:51.895
So, tell me, Mr. Rostoff,

44:52.490 --> 44:54.936
what was Michael like in the early days?

44:54.992 --> 44:57.802
"Early days"? You make me sound ancient.

44:58.829 --> 45:01.901
Michael, you do look a
little the worse for wear.

45:01.966 --> 45:03.639
All earned in the line of duty.

45:03.701 --> 45:05.009
[laughs]

45:06.070 --> 45:07.811
[speaking Russian]

45:09.373 --> 45:10.977
(Rostoff) Tanya?

45:13.311 --> 45:15.757
[speaking Russian]

45:25.990 --> 45:28.197
(Archangel) Give her time, Vlad.

45:28.259 --> 45:30.068
[liquid pouring]

45:30.127 --> 45:32.266
(Marella) Well, you haven't
answered my question.

45:32.330 --> 45:33.331
(Marella) Thank you.

45:34.165 --> 45:35.542
Excuse me.

45:36.367 --> 45:39.177
Well, in the beginning, Michael was

45:39.237 --> 45:41.740
a bit of a womanizer.

45:41.806 --> 45:42.876
(Archangel) What?

45:42.940 --> 45:44.817
[laughing]

45:44.875 --> 45:46.980
(Marella) Do you… have you made any plans?

45:47.044 --> 45:50.514
(Marella) Now that you're
back in the United States…

45:50.715 --> 45:53.958
[bird cawing]

45:55.286 --> 46:00.031
[birds twittering]

46:25.383 --> 46:27.556
(Hawke) Kind of pretty, huh?

46:28.019 --> 46:31.432
It is not so beautiful

46:32.423 --> 46:33.800
as Russia.

46:35.626 --> 46:36.832
Yeah. From what I saw,

46:36.894 --> 46:39.272
that was a really beautiful country.

46:39.330 --> 46:41.970
Not commercial like United States.

46:42.199 --> 46:44.008
[birds chirping]

46:44.068 --> 46:46.014
I guess you'll be going back.

46:46.070 --> 46:47.515
Of course.

46:49.373 --> 46:52.354
Just as soon as Mama and Papa…

46:54.145 --> 46:58.252
I will never give up Russia. Never.

46:59.250 --> 47:01.560
Nobody is asking you to, Tanya.

47:03.754 --> 47:06.428
You can't give up what's in your heart.

47:06.490 --> 47:09.699
You mean I will not be
forced to become American?

47:09.827 --> 47:11.067
Well,

47:12.963 --> 47:16.069
I'm sure there'll be a lot of people
who'll try to Americanize you.

47:16.133 --> 47:17.669
That's only natural.

47:17.735 --> 47:18.406
(Hawke) You might even find out

47:18.436 --> 47:21.144
some things about this country you like.

47:21.205 --> 47:22.343
Like what?

47:22.406 --> 47:23.976
I don't know.

47:24.442 --> 47:27.889
Music, books, films, fast food.

47:28.312 --> 47:31.259
[bird chirping]

47:31.449 --> 47:34.555
But most of all, the freedom
to accept or reject

47:34.618 --> 47:37.428
our culture or our politics as you see fit.

47:38.456 --> 47:39.764
Prove it.

47:40.491 --> 47:43.938
That's something you'll have
to find out for yourself.
