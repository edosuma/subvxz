It's unbelievable.

00:33.166 --> 00:35.083
I'm staying in this hotel.

00:35.083 --> 00:38.083
Well, in any case,
I kept thinking about our conversation,

00:38.083 --> 00:40.000
and I couldn't get it out of my head.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.625
And I started thinking,
maybe you thought I was rude or impolite.

00:42.625 --> 00:45.666
- Because I left so suddenly, and--

00:52.375 --> 00:55.041
Well, I just got divorced,
and I had promised myself--

00:55.041 --> 00:57.166
- I'd love to hear about that promise.
- Okay.

00:57.166 --> 00:59.166
- Now it's me that might seem rude--
- Getting in?

00:59.166 --> 01:01.833
Yes, yes. Yes.
To be honest, I'm in a real hurry.

01:01.833 --> 01:04.791
- I'm late for a concert.
- In that case, why don't I come with you?

Capisce?

02:13.500 --> 02:16.000
And which hand will you use to grab it?

02:16.000 --> 02:18.083
I already know you're good
with your hands,

02:18.083 --> 02:19.916
but that chalice is pretty heavy.

02:19.916 --> 02:21.708

02:43.208 --> 02:45.791
I promised myself
that I would... take a break

02:45.791 --> 02:47.791
and not see anyone for a little while.

02:47.791 --> 02:49.416
Do you mind if I get dressed?

02:49.416 --> 02:51.500
I brought some clothes

- [whimsical music playing]
- But of course. Yes. Be my guest.

02:54.041 --> 02:56.708
Um, I was looking forward to...

02:56.708 --> 02:59.416
to enjoying some time on my own.

02:59.416 --> 03:00.708
A life of solitude.

03:00.708 --> 03:04.666
You see, what my heart needs
is time to find peace.

03:04.666 --> 03:06.583
Don't you think that sounds misogynistic?

03:06.583 --> 03:08.041
No. [chuckles] No. Not at all.

03:08.041 --> 03:12.000
Personally, I find it's more a question
of self-preservation.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.333
But then, after our conversation,
I began to wonder.

03:16.333 --> 03:20.208
What if I'm punishing myself
for a failed marriage, huh?

03:20.208 --> 03:23.416
Am I, in fact, denying myself
the opportunity of meeting

03:23.416 --> 03:24.791

03:25.500 --> 03:27.958
There are four billion women
on this planet.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.041
The chances of meeting someone
truly fascinating are quite slim.

03:32.041 --> 03:34.375
And to ignore
such a chance is unacceptable.

03:34.375 --> 03:37.833
And that's why I called out
to you like a madman on the street.

03:37.833 --> 03:39.958
I mean, what are
the chances we would ever...

03:39.958 --> 03:40.875
May I?

03:40.875 --> 03:42.333
- Yes?
- ...meet?

03:44.125 --> 03:46.125
And... and that's why I'm here.

with your program. [chuckles]

in some cool club, you put on the goggles,

and you experience it
with all your senses.

20:23.625 --> 20:24.750
But it's not real.

20:24.750 --> 20:26.041
You're here, in a room.

But your brain processes it
like it's real.

you talk with people from other countries.

We were on a mission for Berlin.
We didn't have to tell you anything.

21:12.500 --> 21:15.291
We've been calling him all night,
but he hasn't answered.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.541
A few hours in Paris,
and what a fucking mess.

21:19.166 --> 21:21.958
And I'm not talking
about breaking into Polignac's place.

21:21.958 --> 21:25.333
I'm talking about attacking a priest
and dragging him down the street.

21:25.333 --> 21:27.833
About crashing into
the middle of a wedding.

21:28.666 --> 21:30.375

- Twenty--
- [waitress] Here's your croissant.

21:36.916 --> 21:38.916
You set off 26 car alarms.

21:39.708 --> 21:41.208

21:41.708 --> 21:44.750
And you have breakfast
with croissants and café au lait,

21:44.750 --> 21:46.291
as if nothing had happened.

21:46.291 --> 21:47.750
He wasn't alone.

21:48.791 --> 21:52.125
And it wasn't easy to steal the chalice
with those two gorillas around.

21:53.083 --> 21:54.541
Well, in that case,

21:54.541 --> 21:58.166
let's all sit back and relax
and order some eggs Benedict. Okay?

21:58.166 --> 21:59.166
Monsieur?

22:01.708 --> 22:02.916
But for a small miracle,

22:02.916 --> 22:06.166

22:11.458 --> 22:12.583
Where'd you get it?

22:12.583 --> 22:16.250
Last night, the priest came to see me,
scared out of his wits and limping.

22:16.250 --> 22:18.250
He said
he was no longer traveling to Spain

22:18.250 --> 22:20.375
and that we were right about security.

22:20.375 --> 22:22.750
He said some scoundrels
had tried to rob him.

22:22.750 --> 22:24.583
He said he had a backache.

22:24.583 --> 22:26.916
That we should continue our dig
and that he was on leave

22:26.916 --> 22:30.250
for a week because he felt so shaken,
he couldn't say Mass.

22:33.583 --> 22:34.791
All that to say,

22:35.791 --> 22:38.791
luck is on our side,
and we have seven days to drill a hole.

22:39.375 --> 22:41.208
And you will wake up Berlin.

22:43.250 --> 22:44.500
[firmly] Now.

22:50.833 --> 22:51.916
Are you okay?

22:51.916 --> 22:53.250
Fine.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.500
I guess I needed the adrenaline.

22:56.666 --> 22:58.291
You don't have to be here, Cameron.

23:00.250 --> 23:02.250
I told Berlin I'd stay to the end.

- And I will.

23:25.416 --> 23:27.791

23:28.291 --> 23:29.125
You're welcome.

23:29.833 --> 23:32.000
You know, I'd wear my tuxedo
to a McDonald's with you.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.958
All you would have to do is ask me.

23:33.958 --> 23:37.541
<i>I was on the balcony,
looking at your hotel,</i>

23:38.041 --> 23:40.291
<i>wondering whether you
would still be there.</i>

23:45.791 --> 23:46.875

23:48.791 --> 23:50.875
<i>If you like,
we could have breakfast together.</i>

23:52.541 --> 23:54.833
Before I answer that,
I have something to tell you.

23:54.833 --> 23:55.791
I'm married.

23:56.333 --> 23:58.250
<i>- For the past eight years.</i>
- Mm-hmm.

23:58.833 --> 24:01.916
But yesterday, I felt
a special connection with you.

24:01.916 --> 24:03.875
One that rarely happens in life.

24:03.875 --> 24:06.791
<i>You said there were
four billion women on this planet.</i>

24:06.791 --> 24:08.583
<i>There are also four billion men.</i>

24:09.166 --> 24:12.666
And it's not that easy
to meet someone you'd like to know better.

24:13.375 --> 24:15.791
Or a life you might want to explore.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.583
First, you tell me that you're married,
then you tell me you want to explore?

24:20.583 --> 24:23.416
<i>I'm afraid I'm a little confused
about this exploration.</i>

24:23.416 --> 24:25.250
Well, I'll do my best to explain.

24:26.208 --> 24:27.875
<i>When do you leave Paris?</i>

24:29.416 --> 24:30.416
Tomorrow morning.

24:31.541 --> 24:33.583
What a shame
that you have to leave so early.

25:00.791 --> 25:01.791
Good morning.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.708
Roi, you just missed
an extraordinary moment.

25:06.708 --> 25:07.750
It was epic.

25:07.750 --> 25:10.000
[inhales sharply] This way. This way.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.583
It's time to celebrate, Roi.

25:11.583 --> 25:12.958
Some bubbly for you.

25:12.958 --> 25:15.083
And some more bubbly for me.

25:15.833 --> 25:17.458
Is this because we found the chalice?

25:17.458 --> 25:19.708
Roi, no. No, no, no. It's because of <i>her</i>.

25:20.750 --> 25:21.666
Here.

25:23.041 --> 25:24.708
Roi, she called me.

25:25.666 --> 25:29.208
- Polignac's wife?
- Why do you dwell on these minor details?

25:30.125 --> 25:33.583
The only thing that matters
is that the countdown has begun.

25:34.416 --> 25:36.750
I've made my move, and she's in check.

25:36.750 --> 25:37.833
[both laugh]

25:37.833 --> 25:41.458
And now, I just have to wait
and see what move she makes next.

25:41.458 --> 25:44.625
[inhales sharply] I'm pretty sure
she'll call in less than three hours.

25:44.625 --> 25:46.708
Actually, no. I'd say, tops, one hour.

25:46.708 --> 25:47.916
Maybe one and a half.

26:10.250 --> 26:11.625
May I come in?

26:16.875 --> 26:19.125
Actually, that's not a good idea.

26:20.041 --> 26:22.208
You just told me that you're married.

26:22.208 --> 26:26.541
And if I let you inside, I won't let you
out until after Christmas. [chuckles]

26:26.541 --> 26:28.333
[Camille laughs]

26:28.333 --> 26:30.875
Camille... [swallows heavily]

26:31.375 --> 26:32.833
...I'm not looking for an affair.

26:32.833 --> 26:34.875
At least, not some ordinary,
trivial affair.

26:35.750 --> 26:37.416
I'm looking for something unique.

26:37.916 --> 26:39.333
And unique...

26:39.833 --> 26:43.875
well, that's just not compatible
with being your lover on the side.

26:43.875 --> 26:45.083
[gasps softly]

26:46.125 --> 26:48.458
Uh, when is an affair trivial?

26:49.083 --> 26:50.166
Can you tell me?

26:50.166 --> 26:51.458
Because I can't.

26:52.708 --> 26:55.208
I live my life as intensely as possible.

26:56.166 --> 27:00.333
Some nights, when I can't sleep,
I get up and go to a bar.

27:01.041 --> 27:02.750
I speak with everyone I meet.

27:03.250 --> 27:04.708
I drink tequila.

27:04.708 --> 27:06.625
And I dance like crazy.

27:08.458 --> 27:12.000
And when I go home, I'm happy.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.458
Because I've experienced
something spontaneous.

27:15.458 --> 27:18.833
I guess most people
would just toss and turn in their beds,

27:18.833 --> 27:20.916
but I wanna live life to the fullest.

27:20.916 --> 27:24.166
I can't lie there and stare at the ceiling

27:25.583 --> 27:27.125
when there are people like you

27:27.708 --> 27:30.375
who appear in your life
when you least expect it.

27:32.208 --> 27:33.416
[chuckles]

27:33.416 --> 27:37.041
In any case, I understand what you mean.

And I appreciate it even more
because it shows how honest you are.

with someone of my own gender.

31:41.208 --> 31:44.166
I've always had a good idea
about what I like and don't like in life.

31:44.166 --> 31:45.708
Hm? Literature.

31:45.708 --> 31:48.000
I like the classics.
I dislike bestsellers.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.875
Nutrition. I like moussaka,
and I can't stand fried food.

31:50.875 --> 31:51.958

31:51.958 --> 31:54.833
I like the smart ones with good manners.
The intellectual types.

And I hate the vulgar ones
who make catcalls and dirty comments.

who spend their time taking selfies

- I get it.
- Well, all that's gone down the drain.

32:07.125 --> 32:09.208

with a part of my brain,

- I guess it's animal instinct.

- Bruce.
- You like Bruce?

- No.
- You like Bruce.

No. I don't like him. Not at all. I don't.

But... when I see him,

32:27.000 --> 32:27.958
I feel flush.

and I have what's called dyspnea.

enough oxygen into your lungs.

33:12.333 --> 33:14.000
What do you mean, his underwear?

One time, I saw them
sticking out of his pants.

- Always.
- What name?

"Lobo." That's the Spanish word for wolf.

very unusual has happened.

- Don't be silly.
- [laughs]

like I've become addicted to his scent.

Huh. What do you mean?

33:42.000 --> 33:43.625
I can smell him.

whenever he walks by, I smell him.

33:48.291 --> 33:50.208
What smell? His cologne?

33:50.208 --> 33:51.916
No, I don't think he uses cologne.

33:51.916 --> 33:55.291
It's something like... uh...

37:47.291 --> 37:50.291
Work on the tunnel will be completed

37:50.291 --> 37:52.333
that will lead us to our goal.

37:52.833 --> 37:54.791
The Viénot Auction House.

37:55.291 --> 37:56.541
And what's that wall?

37:56.541 --> 37:58.541
It's the retaining wall of the building.

37:58.541 --> 38:00.666
We break through it
to get inside the auction house.

38:04.416 --> 38:07.458
But instead of getting into the vault
through the main steel doors,

38:08.291 --> 38:10.083

38:10.083 --> 38:12.166
No one expects that. [laughs]

38:14.375 --> 38:17.166
And in order to get access
to the back door,

38:17.166 --> 38:19.958
first, we move
into the air chamber and service area

38:19.958 --> 38:24.208
with pipes, supply boxes,
electrical equipment, and sanitation.

38:24.708 --> 38:26.708
[energetic music continues]

38:28.916 --> 38:31.875
Once inside, there'll be
a wall of concrete blocks

38:31.875 --> 38:33.500
that secure the antechamber.

38:33.500 --> 38:35.875
Which then leads us to the vault.

38:38.125 --> 38:41.000
Then, we will cut the iron joints
that connect the blocks.

38:41.000 --> 38:44.333
[Berlin] <i>But we won't move
those blocks yet. And why is that, Damian?</i>

38:44.333 --> 38:47.166
Because inside the antechamber is CCTV,

38:47.166 --> 38:51.166
<i>which is linked directly to the monitors
of the security guards inside.</i>

38:51.666 --> 38:54.750
The guards will be bored
because there's no auction at the moment.

38:54.750 --> 38:55.666
Very bored.

38:55.666 --> 38:58.291
One guard at the main entrance,

38:58.291 --> 39:01.916
and a second one in the basement,
right in front of the vault.

39:01.916 --> 39:05.208
Here again, we can observe
the magnitude of our plan.

39:05.208 --> 39:09.500
Breaking into a vault when it's empty.
Don't you think that's a magnificent idea?

39:09.500 --> 39:11.500
It will optimize the chances of success.

39:11.500 --> 39:13.250
And that's why we need to get those guards

39:13.250 --> 39:15.625
away from their monitors
for three minutes.

39:16.833 --> 39:19.625
That's the minimum amount of time
I'll need to hack the CCTV.

39:19.625 --> 39:21.083
And how do we do it?

39:21.083 --> 39:23.416
Using diversionary tactics.

39:23.416 --> 39:25.041
<i>And for that, we'll need to know</i>

39:25.041 --> 39:28.250

to know about our new friends.</i>

39:28.875 --> 39:31.875
[Berlin] <i>We're going to analyze
every move these gentlemen make.</i>

39:31.875 --> 39:35.958
<i>But first, we must study the foundation
of every security guard's life.</i>

39:36.708 --> 39:37.833
What they eat for dinner.

39:37.833 --> 39:41.166
I'd like to place an order, please.
Two 14-inch pepperoni pizzas.

39:41.166 --> 39:43.708
At eight, they order food
using the landline.

39:44.208 --> 39:46.041
- Yes?
- So, what you order us?

39:46.041 --> 39:47.958
Pepperoni. [chuckles]

39:47.958 --> 39:49.375
- Pizza.
- Almost always pizza.

39:49.375 --> 39:52.208
[Damián] <i>The landline network interface

Thank you.

40:17.208 --> 40:18.958

40:18.958 --> 40:21.541
In the service area,
we will have a changing zone.

<i>There, we will remove all clothes
covered in dirt from the catacombs</i>

40:24.833 --> 40:26.750
<i>and put on our hazmat suits.</i>

40:26.750 --> 40:30.958
I don't want anyone in the antechamber
or the vault without their suit or gloves.

40:30.958 --> 40:32.833
<i>A fingerprint or a speck of dirt,</i>

40:32.833 --> 40:34.833

40:36.750 --> 40:38.750
[tense music playing]

40:38.750 --> 40:41.000
We'll use that time
to finish our preparations.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.083
<i>But mostly, we'll use the time...</i>

40:43.083 --> 40:44.750
You took 90 minutes?

40:44.750 --> 40:46.791
...to piss off the security guards.

40:48.875 --> 40:49.750
Cold food.

40:49.750 --> 40:52.250
They're not pepperoni,
and they're fuckin' cold.

40:52.250 --> 40:53.541

40:53.541 --> 40:55.291
And they're not 14-inch.

leaves his post,

- Stand up. Up you go.
- What's goin' on? Where am I?

45:53.083 --> 45:54.333
That's it. Up you get.

45:54.333 --> 45:55.708
[Roi on earpiece] <i>Five seconds.</i>

45:55.708 --> 45:56.750
Get out, now.

45:56.750 --> 45:58.125
Shut up, Roi.

45:58.708 --> 45:59.583
[electricity crackles]

45:59.583 --> 46:00.541
Done!

46:00.541 --> 46:01.625
[electricity humming]

46:01.625 --> 46:03.000
Here. Take that.

46:03.708 --> 46:07.458
- For the pizza.
- There we go. You'll be fine. All right.

46:07.458 --> 46:09.500
- [stopwatch ticking]
- That's it. Out of time.

46:09.500 --> 46:11.083
You gotta leave. Get out.

46:11.083 --> 46:13.208
- Leave. I'll do it.
- Almost done.

46:13.208 --> 46:16.458
Once we have control
of the video signal to the monitors,

46:16.458 --> 46:18.958
it's imperative that you leave
as quickly as possible.

46:18.958 --> 46:20.833
- Leave!
- [panting]

46:23.291 --> 46:24.458
Thanks.

46:26.208 --> 46:27.125
See ya.

46:27.750 --> 46:29.458
[guard, under breath]
What a fucking asshole.

46:38.750 --> 46:40.541
Hurry! Move!

46:41.833 --> 46:45.375
And then, we put back the concrete block,
right where it was.

46:52.125 --> 46:54.416

[Berlin] <i>And then,
we shall be ready to begin</i>

47:21.125 --> 47:24.083
the wonderful second act
of our marvelous magic show.

47:24.083 --> 47:27.625
How to open a vault
that has steel walls over ten inches deep.

47:27.625 --> 47:30.250
[Berlin] <i>And more importantly,
how to do it unnoticed</i>.

47:30.250 --> 47:32.166
So we can come and go as we please,

47:32.166 --> 47:35.041
as if it was a revolving door
in a luxury hotel.

47:35.041 --> 47:37.291
An act worthy of David Copperfield.
