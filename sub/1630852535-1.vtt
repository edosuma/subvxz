WEBVTT

00:16.538 --> 00:18.148
- Speak Josie, speak.

01:31.178 --> 01:33.571
- Smooth move, klutz.

01:33.615 --> 01:34.572
- Loser!

01:34.616 --> 01:37.097
- All right, class, settle down.

01:39.142 --> 01:40.709
Mickey.

01:40.752 --> 01:41.927
Come up here and
solve this problem

01:41.971 --> 01:43.799
on the board for me.

02:00.685 --> 02:02.861
- I'll see you after class.

02:04.211 --> 02:05.647
- Ooooh!

02:05.690 --> 02:07.562
- Hey, hey,
that's enough of that.

02:07.605 --> 02:10.217
Go to the board and
solve the problem.

02:23.186 --> 02:25.971
- Hey, word on the street is
Mickey is gonna bust you up

02:26.015 --> 02:28.060
like he did that 10th
grader last week.

02:28.104 --> 02:29.801
Whew, that was not pretty.

02:29.845 --> 02:30.976
- Thanks.

02:31.020 --> 02:32.848
You're not helping.

02:33.892 --> 02:35.938
Maybe I can make it to
the car before he gets me.

02:35.981 --> 02:36.939
- Yeah, maybe.

02:41.639 --> 02:42.858
Dead man walking.

02:51.867 --> 02:54.522
- Where do you think
you're going, geek?

02:54.565 --> 02:57.002
Let's see if the little wussy
scout can knock me down now.

02:57.046 --> 02:59.222
- Look, I didn't mean to
trip you, it was an accident.

02:59.266 --> 03:00.963
- Accident huh?

03:01.006 --> 03:03.966
I think it's time for
you to have an accident.

03:04.009 --> 03:05.968
- Fight,
fight, fight, fight!

03:06.838 --> 03:08.188
Fight, fight, fight!

03:08.231 --> 03:09.754
- Didn't they teach you
self-defense in Boy Scouts?

03:11.234 --> 03:12.844
Looks like the only thing
you know how to do is bleed!

03:14.759 --> 03:16.152
- Hey, hey, are you okay?
- Yeah.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.022
- Here.

03:19.721 --> 03:20.678
You're bleeding.

03:20.722 --> 03:23.028
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

03:23.072 --> 03:24.856
- Now we're both
gonna be in trouble.

03:24.900 --> 03:27.990
- What are they
gonna do? Suspend me?

03:28.033 --> 03:31.689
Lets see, that means
I get to stay home,

03:31.733 --> 03:35.258
sleep late, uh, and swim
in the pool all day.

03:36.738 --> 03:39.219
- Why did you help me?

03:39.262 --> 03:42.874
- Because your nose
was taking a pounding

03:43.962 --> 03:46.226
and I sort of like your nose.

04:00.936 --> 04:02.938
- What happened to you?

04:02.981 --> 04:04.113
- I don't wanna talk about it.

04:04.156 --> 04:05.941
- It looks like somebody
got into a fight.

04:05.984 --> 04:08.030
My Sunday school
teacher says you should

04:08.073 --> 04:10.989
always turn the other cheek
and you should never fight.

04:11.033 --> 04:13.035
- Yeah, thanks.
I'll remember that.

04:13.078 --> 04:14.254
- Are you okay?

04:15.167 --> 04:15.994
Hey.

04:18.432 --> 04:19.911
Oh.

04:19.955 --> 04:23.175
If you don't wanna tell me
about it, that's okay, okay?

04:23.219 --> 04:26.178
You tell me when you're ready.

04:41.063 --> 04:42.151
Are you asleep?

04:43.108 --> 04:44.284
- No. I can't.

04:48.723 --> 04:51.334
- Do you wanna tell
me what's wrong?

04:51.378 --> 04:54.946
- Well, to start off, everyone
at school makes fun of me,

04:54.990 --> 04:57.949
I got no friends,
nobody likes me,

04:57.993 --> 05:00.996
and the saddest part is, I don't
even know if I like myself.

05:01.039 --> 05:05.305
- Sweetheart, you are a
loving, caring, wonderful boy.

05:06.436 --> 05:08.003
Why would you say such a thing?

05:08.046 --> 05:12.050
- I don't know mom,
maybe it's this place.

05:12.094 --> 05:14.096
- Well what do you mean?

05:15.097 --> 05:17.012
- Remember when Dad took
us up to the mountains

05:17.055 --> 05:18.187
and Grandma and Grandpa's?

05:18.230 --> 05:19.841
- Yeah.

05:19.884 --> 05:22.147
- That was one of the
best weekends of my life.

05:22.191 --> 05:24.106
I just think spending some
time away from this place

05:24.149 --> 05:25.977
would be good for all of us.

05:26.021 --> 05:28.850
And plus, I miss Uncle Joey.

05:28.893 --> 05:30.460
- Yeah, well Uncle Joey
has his own life now

05:30.504 --> 05:32.854
and I can't miss any work.

05:33.898 --> 05:38.729
- Well, he said he'd come and
get us whenever we wanted.

05:39.426 --> 05:41.123
- I just don't know.

05:44.126 --> 05:45.083
- Please, mom.

05:47.912 --> 05:49.827
- You really want
this, don't you?

05:49.871 --> 05:52.961
- Not only do I want
this, I need it.

05:55.137 --> 05:56.486
- Okay.

05:56.530 --> 06:00.360
Let me think about it and
we'll talk in the morning.

06:00.403 --> 06:01.317
I love you.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.100
- I love you too, Mom.

06:02.144 --> 06:03.363
- Okay.

06:58.069 --> 07:00.463
- Oh excuse me.

07:00.507 --> 07:02.291
I'll be right back.

07:07.992 --> 07:08.906
Hello?

07:08.950 --> 07:10.908
- Hey, Joey?

07:10.952 --> 07:12.257
It's Peggy.

07:12.301 --> 07:15.522
- Sis, hey. How are
you and the kids doing?

07:15.565 --> 07:17.088
- Good.

07:17.132 --> 07:18.481
Um, sorry to call so late.

07:18.525 --> 07:20.178
Are you already in bed?

07:22.877 --> 07:24.052
- Uh, not yet.

07:25.227 --> 07:26.968
- Are Mom and Dad there?

07:27.011 --> 07:28.926
- Mom and Dad, they went
out of town for the weekend

07:28.970 --> 07:30.798
to go see Aunt Judy
up in the hospital.

07:30.841 --> 07:32.016
They'll be back
tomorrow, though.

07:32.060 --> 07:34.105
Do you want me to
tell them to call you?

07:34.149 --> 07:37.021
- No, I just need to
ask them a question.

07:37.065 --> 07:38.588
- Is there anything
I can help you with?

07:38.632 --> 07:41.199
- I think the kids wanna
come out for the weekend.

07:41.243 --> 07:42.331
- Cool.

07:42.374 --> 07:43.506
- I just don't wanna
interrupt anything.

07:43.550 --> 07:44.942
I wanted to make
sure it was okay.

07:44.986 --> 07:47.249
- Sis, you're never
interrupting anything.

07:47.292 --> 07:49.817
You guys know you are
welcomed here, okay?

07:49.860 --> 07:51.122
So when are you coming?

07:51.166 --> 07:52.384
- Oh, that's just it.

07:52.428 --> 07:54.125
I have to work, so I
was hoping that maybe

07:54.169 --> 07:56.258
you and Dad could pick up
the kids for the weekend?

07:56.301 --> 07:57.520
- I will come up and personally

07:57.564 --> 07:59.087
pick the kids up
tomorrow morning.

07:59.130 --> 08:00.523
- Really? Are you
sure it's no trouble?

08:00.567 --> 08:02.612
- Of course. Who's
their favorite uncle?

08:02.656 --> 08:04.048
- You are.

08:04.092 --> 08:05.354
- All right, then I'll
be there to see you.

08:05.397 --> 08:06.573
Tomorrow morning.

08:06.616 --> 08:08.575
- Joey, the kids are
gonna be so happy.

08:08.618 --> 08:10.228
Thank you.

08:10.272 --> 08:11.316
Bye.

08:17.061 --> 08:18.149
- Get up! Get up!

08:18.193 --> 08:19.368
- No, go away!

08:19.411 --> 08:21.457
- You better wake up
or you're gonna miss

08:21.501 --> 08:23.154
your trip to the mountains.

08:23.198 --> 08:24.460
- What?

08:24.504 --> 08:27.028
You're not joking, are you?

08:27.071 --> 08:28.333
Yes, yes, yes!

08:28.377 --> 08:30.031
Yes, yes!

08:30.074 --> 08:31.336
- But you need to hurry
up because your Uncle Joey

08:31.380 --> 08:35.036
is on his way, so you
need to start packing.

08:35.079 --> 08:36.385
- Yes!

08:36.428 --> 08:38.082
- Let's go.

08:45.568 --> 08:46.874
- Oh, boy, are you ready?

08:46.917 --> 08:47.744
- Yup.

08:47.788 --> 08:51.879
- Oh my god.

08:51.922 --> 08:52.532
- Hey!

08:52.575 --> 08:53.358
- Hey!
- Hey!

08:54.621 --> 08:55.360
- Woo, wow, you
should grow more.

08:55.404 --> 08:56.274
- Yeah.

08:56.318 --> 08:57.493
- Good to see you. Hi, sis.

08:57.537 --> 08:58.538
- Thank you for
coming to get them.

08:58.581 --> 08:59.887
- Oh you're so welcome.

08:59.930 --> 09:00.627
We're gonna have a great
weekend, aren't we?

09:00.670 --> 09:02.193
- Hi.
- Give me a hug.

09:02.237 --> 09:04.326
- They need a good weekend away.

09:04.369 --> 09:05.240
- Well, they're gonna have it.

09:05.283 --> 09:06.371
Here let's hug it out, buddy.

09:06.415 --> 09:08.199
All right, now
give me your stuff.

09:08.243 --> 09:09.200
Let's get loaded up.

09:09.244 --> 09:10.506
- Okay.

09:10.550 --> 09:11.376
- I call shotgun.
- Call me when you get there.

09:11.420 --> 09:12.900
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

09:13.596 --> 09:15.206
- Take good care of your sister.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.033
- Yes, I know.

09:16.077 --> 09:17.121
- Okay.

09:17.165 --> 09:18.209
Oh you need help?
- Yep.

09:18.253 --> 09:19.254
- I got you.

09:20.995 --> 09:22.518
- Can you hop in?
- Okay, watch your phone.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.563
- Okay.

09:23.606 --> 09:25.086
- Okay.

09:25.129 --> 09:26.217
You take care of my babies.

09:26.261 --> 09:28.219
- I sure will.

09:28.263 --> 09:29.394
- Buckle up.
- All right, kids buckle up.

09:29.438 --> 09:30.570
Buckle up.
- Put you seatbelt on.

09:30.613 --> 09:32.354
- I know, Mom.

09:34.661 --> 09:36.924
- Be good, now.

09:36.967 --> 09:37.577
Bye.

09:42.277 --> 09:44.061
- So how's school?

09:44.105 --> 09:45.410
- I like school.

09:45.454 --> 09:46.455
- What
about you, Scottie?

09:46.498 --> 09:47.717
- He doesn't like school

09:47.761 --> 09:48.544
because he doesn't
have any friends.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.067
- What? I have friends.

09:50.111 --> 09:51.025
- Who?

09:51.068 --> 09:52.330
- Victor and Tommy Adkins.

09:52.374 --> 09:54.724
- Victor is a huge
nerd and Tommy Adkins?

09:54.768 --> 09:57.161
Yuck, he's the
smelliest boy in school.

09:57.205 --> 09:58.598
He smells like pickles.

09:58.641 --> 10:00.121
I'm not kidding.

10:01.470 --> 10:03.298
- Kids in school picking on you?

10:03.341 --> 10:05.996
- The only time they talk
to me is to pick on me.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.563
- What do you do about that?

10:07.607 --> 10:10.131
- I don't do anything.

10:10.174 --> 10:12.655
- Well, you have to
stand up for yourself.

10:12.699 --> 10:14.265
- What do you mean? Like fight?

10:14.309 --> 10:16.180
- If you have to.

10:16.224 --> 10:18.008
What do you do for fun
when you're not in school?

10:18.052 --> 10:19.401
- He doesn't do anything.

10:19.444 --> 10:21.272
He just sits in his room
all day and picks his nose.

10:21.316 --> 10:22.317
- Is that true?

10:22.360 --> 10:23.405
- Yeah.

10:24.798 --> 10:27.714
- You know, tomorrow's
not promised buddy.

10:27.757 --> 10:29.367
You gotta have fun,
you gotta get out there

10:29.411 --> 10:31.239
and live a little bit.

10:32.501 --> 10:34.677
- Uncle Joey, can I
ask you a question?

10:34.721 --> 10:35.635
- Sure.

10:35.678 --> 10:37.114
- Aren't you a little old

10:37.158 --> 10:38.681
to be living at home
with your parents?

10:38.725 --> 10:41.510
- Oh well you know, I tried
that whole move out of the house

10:41.553 --> 10:43.599
and get a job thing
and it really stunk.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.383
So whatever you
do, don't do that

10:45.427 --> 10:47.211
and always stay at home.

10:47.255 --> 10:48.430
Never leave home.

10:50.084 --> 10:52.477
- I ain't gonna lie,
I thought about it.

10:52.521 --> 10:54.610
Just the other day,
I was on my bike

10:54.654 --> 10:57.004
and I thought to myself
I could pedal across

10:57.047 --> 10:59.180
the United States
if I wanted to.

10:59.223 --> 11:01.661
You know, just go.
Hit the open road.

11:01.704 --> 11:04.315
I can see me now, the
wind blowing in my hair.

11:04.359 --> 11:05.665
It would be a wild trip.

11:05.708 --> 11:07.797
- I don't know kid, that
sounds a little dangerous.

11:07.841 --> 11:10.365
- Uncle Joey, I'm dangerous.

11:14.674 --> 11:17.546
- Hey, I've got a
question for you guys.

11:17.589 --> 11:18.678
Do you wanna go
camping this weekend?

11:18.721 --> 11:20.114
- Yeah!

11:20.157 --> 11:22.159
- A group of friends and
I we go camping a lot

11:22.203 --> 11:23.683
and we play war games.

11:23.726 --> 11:25.293
- What's war games?

11:25.336 --> 11:28.165
- War games is like,
it's all about strategy

11:28.209 --> 11:29.427
and survival, you know?

11:29.471 --> 11:31.081
We pick a spot way out
in the middle of nowhere

11:31.125 --> 11:32.561
and we put this yellow
flag and the first person

11:32.604 --> 11:35.346
or team to get to
that yellow flag wins.

11:35.390 --> 11:37.044
- Okay, it sounds easy.

11:37.087 --> 11:38.349
- Yeah, but the hard part
is getting to that flag

11:38.393 --> 11:39.699
without getting shot or killed.

11:39.742 --> 11:40.569
- Killed?

11:41.744 --> 11:43.441
- Well, we don't
really get killed.

11:43.485 --> 11:44.921
We do it with paint ball guns.

11:44.965 --> 11:47.532
You know, they look like real
guns but it's just paint.

11:47.576 --> 11:49.491
- So no one gets hurt?

11:49.534 --> 11:51.362
- Well I mean, it
hurts if you get hit

11:51.406 --> 11:53.190
but it only stings for a minute.

11:53.234 --> 11:54.714
And it's so much fun.

11:55.671 --> 11:57.064
What do you say?

11:57.107 --> 11:57.717
- I'm in.

11:57.760 --> 11:58.543
- Me, too.

11:58.587 --> 11:59.544
- All right, great.

11:59.588 --> 12:00.763
Hey you know what, though?

12:00.807 --> 12:01.546
I need you to do
something for me.

12:01.590 --> 12:02.591
- What?

12:09.816 --> 12:11.208
- Hey, Scottie.

12:11.252 --> 12:12.383
Get out of the car and
come talk man-to-man

12:12.427 --> 12:14.124
with me for a second.

12:21.262 --> 12:23.525
Hey listen, I need you to call
your mom for me, all right?

12:23.568 --> 12:25.179
I need you to tell her we're at

12:25.222 --> 12:26.615
Grandma and Grandpa's house and
if she asks to talk to them,

12:26.658 --> 12:27.877
you gotta tell her
that they're in town

12:27.921 --> 12:29.574
doing some stuff, okay?

12:29.618 --> 12:30.793
- Why? Why do I have to do this?

12:30.837 --> 12:33.143
- It's the only way.

12:33.187 --> 12:34.144
- Why...

12:34.188 --> 12:35.493
Why do I have to lie?

12:35.537 --> 12:36.712
- Because your mom will
kill me if I take you away

12:36.756 --> 12:38.235
to the woods for
the weekend, man.

12:38.279 --> 12:39.759
Come on, hey, in the Boy Scouts

12:39.802 --> 12:41.238
there's a code of honor, right?

12:41.282 --> 12:42.587
So my friends and I have
a code of honor, too.

12:42.631 --> 12:43.806
I'm not really supposed
to tell anybody

12:43.850 --> 12:46.287
what we do on the weekends.

12:47.375 --> 12:49.594
But, from the sounds of it,
you could use some adventure

12:49.638 --> 12:51.814
more than anyone I've
ever seen in my life, man.

12:51.858 --> 12:53.729
Come on, you're 14-years-old,
you're a man now.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.644
It's time to use some of
those Boy Scout skills.

12:55.687 --> 12:57.298
And what better place do
do it than out in the woods

12:57.341 --> 12:59.474
where survival is everything?

12:59.517 --> 13:00.388
So what do you say?

13:00.431 --> 13:01.432
Are we gonna do this?

13:01.476 --> 13:02.694
- I don't know.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.523
- Look, I'll make
this easy on you.

13:05.567 --> 13:06.786
The road to the left there,

13:06.829 --> 13:08.570
that goes to Grandma
and Grandpa's house.

13:08.613 --> 13:10.877
The road to the right, it goes
way up in to the mountains

13:10.920 --> 13:13.314
where eventually the
war games will start.

13:13.357 --> 13:15.142
So you just point the way.

13:20.582 --> 13:22.932
All right, call your mom.

13:26.631 --> 13:28.372
Let me talk to her.

13:34.335 --> 13:34.901
- Hello?

13:34.944 --> 13:35.815
- Hey, sis.

13:35.858 --> 13:37.468
- Joey?
- Yeah, yeah.

13:37.512 --> 13:38.426
Hey, I wanted to just
call you and let you know

13:38.469 --> 13:39.601
everything's doing great.

13:39.644 --> 13:40.471
- Are you already there?

13:40.515 --> 13:42.212
- Yeah, yeah.

13:42.256 --> 13:44.258
I mean, there wasn't a lot of
traffic so we made good time.

13:44.301 --> 13:45.520
- How are the kids?

13:45.563 --> 13:47.217
- Oh, they're doing great,
they're doing great.

13:47.261 --> 13:49.959
Hey listen, Scottie wants
to talk to you for a sec.

13:50.003 --> 13:51.482
- Hi, Mom.

13:51.526 --> 13:52.570
- Hi sweetheart, how
are you and your sister doing?

13:52.614 --> 13:54.485
- Yeah, we're fine, we're fine.

13:54.529 --> 13:56.052
- Okay good.

13:56.096 --> 13:58.620
Now listen, if your grandparents
need help around the house,

13:58.663 --> 14:00.274
you give them a hand, okay?

14:00.317 --> 14:01.405
And don't forget
to brush your teeth

14:01.449 --> 14:02.493
and wash up before you eat.

14:02.537 --> 14:03.843
- Yeah, yeah, Mom, I got it.

14:03.886 --> 14:05.322
- I love you.
- Yeah, I gotta go.

14:05.366 --> 14:08.630
- Wait, let me talk
to your grandparents.

14:08.673 --> 14:10.675
- They're not here right now.

14:10.719 --> 14:12.721
They went to the store
to get some things.

14:12.764 --> 14:16.681
- Okay, well, let
me talk to Uncle Joey.

14:16.725 --> 14:17.900
- Hey.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.336
- Are you sure it's no trouble?

14:19.380 --> 14:20.772
- Oh, come on, it's
no problem at all.

14:20.816 --> 14:22.557
We're gonna have the
greatest weekend ever.

14:22.600 --> 14:23.688
- Okay.

14:23.732 --> 14:24.907
- Bye.

14:25.777 --> 14:26.604
Good job.

14:32.567 --> 14:33.611
- Hey Chief.

14:33.655 --> 14:34.699
- Yeah.

14:36.266 --> 14:39.530
- I mean, would it kill
him to smile and say hello?

14:39.574 --> 14:41.532
- Well, hey, he's had
it a little rough.

14:41.576 --> 14:45.232
How about cutting him
a little slack, buddy?

14:46.842 --> 14:48.017
- We could get
the boys and some beer?

14:48.061 --> 14:48.888
- Boys, beer.

14:48.931 --> 14:50.367
- Yes.

14:50.411 --> 14:51.281
We're about to go.

14:51.325 --> 14:52.543
Let's go somewhere soon.

14:52.587 --> 14:53.544
Wanna go fishing in-

14:53.588 --> 14:54.632
- Ladies.

14:54.676 --> 14:56.591
You know you can't park here.

14:56.634 --> 14:58.419
- We're gonna move
sooner or later.

14:58.462 --> 15:00.682
- Well then do it.

15:00.725 --> 15:01.509
- Don't get your panties

15:01.552 --> 15:02.640
in a wad, chief.

15:03.728 --> 15:04.773
- I heard that.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.397
- All right kids.

15:20.441 --> 15:21.355
These two guys right here,

15:21.398 --> 15:22.530
these are the McKinley brothers.

15:22.573 --> 15:23.531
This is Mike and Travis.

15:23.574 --> 15:24.358
- Howdy.

15:24.401 --> 15:25.620
- Hey.

15:25.663 --> 15:26.926
- This big guy over
here, that's Kimble.

15:26.969 --> 15:28.536
- Call me Bull.

15:28.579 --> 15:30.277
- Bull here used to be a
professional football player.

15:30.320 --> 15:31.669
From what I hear, he was the

15:31.713 --> 15:32.801
hardest hittin' linebacker
in the business.

15:32.844 --> 15:34.411
- And that ain't no bull.

15:34.455 --> 15:36.761
- This is Edward here.

15:36.805 --> 15:38.285
- Good to make
your acquaintance.

15:38.328 --> 15:39.982
- And this
right here is Lisa.

15:40.026 --> 15:41.853
- Hi, good to meet you.

15:41.897 --> 15:44.682
Hello, aren't you just adorable?

15:44.726 --> 15:46.293
- Right back at ya.

15:47.598 --> 15:48.425
- Lisa!

15:49.035 --> 15:50.645
Get over here.

15:56.607 --> 15:58.914
- You guys, uh, wait right here.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.350
What's with the crossbow?

16:00.394 --> 16:01.656
- Gotta eat, don't ya?

16:05.834 --> 16:10.839
- Don't look at me like that.

16:11.535 --> 16:12.710
Are you kidding me?

16:12.754 --> 16:13.581
- Look, I know we've
got rules, man.

16:13.624 --> 16:14.625
- No, no, no.

16:14.669 --> 16:15.931
You look, okay.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.628
You know how important
these war games are to us.

16:17.672 --> 16:19.587
All of us. I need this.

16:19.630 --> 16:20.892
Okay?

16:20.936 --> 16:21.806
- Yeah, I know.

16:21.850 --> 16:23.025
Look, they won't get in the way.

16:23.069 --> 16:24.461
You won't even know
that they're here.

16:24.505 --> 16:25.897
- Yeah, I better
not. For your sake.

16:25.941 --> 16:27.638
- You got my word.

16:42.610 --> 16:43.741
- Woo!

16:43.785 --> 16:46.048
Let's get this party started.

16:49.530 --> 16:50.966
- Give me your bag.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.490
- Hey, excuse me, stewardess.

16:53.534 --> 16:55.710
I'll be carrying my
suitcase on board with me.

16:55.753 --> 16:58.104
- We don't have room
for you and your beer.

16:58.147 --> 16:59.540
- That's fine.

16:59.583 --> 17:02.586
I'll just ride with
the kids and Joey.

17:10.464 --> 17:13.467
- Officer
Shoreman, come in.

17:14.816 --> 17:16.731
- Go for Shoreman.

17:16.774 --> 17:18.472
- What's your 20?

17:18.515 --> 17:19.908
- Hi Betsy.

17:19.951 --> 17:22.824
I'm out here on Mount Holly
Road looking for trouble.

17:22.867 --> 17:23.912
- Well, speaking of trouble,

17:23.955 --> 17:27.698
Chief Baumgardner
is lookin' for you.

17:27.742 --> 17:29.091
- Now is he?

17:29.135 --> 17:30.658
How about telling
him I'm a little bit

17:30.701 --> 17:32.877
indisposed at the moment?

17:32.921 --> 17:35.706
- I'll tell him but he
ain't gonna like it.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.882
- Now, now Betsy,
you know he has a lot

17:37.926 --> 17:39.580
of trouble with his feelings

17:39.623 --> 17:41.712
and he's nothing at all like me.

17:42.713 --> 17:43.845
- Well you could say that again.

17:43.888 --> 17:44.846
You've been showing
your feelings

17:44.889 --> 17:46.891
to every woman in town.

17:46.935 --> 17:51.026
- What can I say?
Women love the uniform.

17:55.857 --> 17:57.032
- What's up?

17:57.076 --> 17:58.425
- Get him.

17:58.468 --> 17:59.078
Get him!

18:01.776 --> 18:04.561
- Don't you think it's
time for you to retire?

18:04.605 --> 18:05.867
- Retire?

18:05.910 --> 18:07.738
They're gonna have
to pry my radar gun

18:07.782 --> 18:10.567
out of my cold, dead
hands before that happens.

18:10.611 --> 18:12.787
I have way too much
fun with this job.

18:13.875 --> 18:14.876
Speaking of fun,
I gotta go, Betsy.

18:14.919 --> 18:16.573
I got one flyin'.

18:18.009 --> 18:20.621
Driver, pull over to
the side of the road.

18:20.664 --> 18:21.839
- Uh oh, no, no, no.

18:21.883 --> 18:23.624
No, you gotta be kiddin' me.

18:23.667 --> 18:24.886
Not right now.

18:24.929 --> 18:26.844
- Oh no.
- Come on, man.

18:26.888 --> 18:28.019
- You need to pull over now.

18:28.063 --> 18:29.456
- I ain't goin' back
to prison for nobody.

18:29.499 --> 18:30.587
- That's right.
- That's right.

18:30.631 --> 18:32.241
- What are you talking about?

18:32.285 --> 18:34.852
- I ain't goin' back
to prison for nobody.

18:34.896 --> 18:37.855
That violates my
parol, don't you think?

18:39.118 --> 18:40.119
And besides, nothing
good came out of prison

18:40.162 --> 18:41.816
except meetin' you guys, man.

18:41.859 --> 18:42.947
- Hey, whatever you
do, brother, I'm with you.

18:42.991 --> 18:44.514
Don't even worry about it.

18:44.558 --> 18:46.951
- You need to pull over!
- Would you shut up?

18:46.995 --> 18:48.605
Just shut up!

18:48.649 --> 18:51.608
And relax.

18:51.652 --> 18:52.827
Everybody be cool, be cool.

18:52.870 --> 18:54.829
He dropped off, he
dropped, he dropped off.

18:54.872 --> 18:56.178
We're good, we're good.

18:56.222 --> 18:57.832
We're good.

18:57.875 --> 18:59.529
- All right.
- Let's roll, man.

18:59.573 --> 19:02.271
- Sweetheart, you know
I love you, right?

19:02.315 --> 19:03.925
Huh? Get over here.

19:06.232 --> 19:06.971
But don't you ever tell
me what to do again,

19:07.015 --> 19:07.755
you understand me?

19:11.846 --> 19:13.717
I run this ship!

19:13.761 --> 19:14.588
I run it!

19:21.029 --> 19:22.857
- Dispatch, come in.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.946
- Go for dispatch.

19:24.989 --> 19:26.295
- Oh, hi Betsy.

19:26.339 --> 19:27.818
Hey, can you get George
to meet me out here

19:27.862 --> 19:30.647
on the far end of
Mount Holly Road?

19:30.691 --> 19:34.956
- Donnie, don't tell me
you ran out of gas again.

19:34.999 --> 19:36.740
- Yep.

19:59.241 --> 20:00.808
- What happened to the
blue lights back there?

20:00.851 --> 20:02.853
- Nothing to worry about.

20:02.897 --> 20:03.898
Call it divine intervention.

20:03.941 --> 20:05.682
Nobody's gonna mess
up our weekend!

20:05.726 --> 20:06.857
Huh?

20:08.250 --> 20:09.817
- All right, here we go.

20:14.038 --> 20:15.214
- Where's my girl?

20:15.257 --> 20:18.347
I know you miss me.
- All right, all right.

20:18.391 --> 20:20.219
There's my sweetheart.

20:21.350 --> 20:22.177
Huh?

20:22.221 --> 20:23.047
- Cool.

20:26.181 --> 20:27.313
- Look at her.

20:31.317 --> 20:32.143
All right, Mike.

20:32.187 --> 20:33.232
- Yep?

20:33.275 --> 20:34.972
- Bull.
- Got 'em, coach.

20:35.016 --> 20:35.799
- Joey.

20:36.931 --> 20:37.932
Sebastian.

20:39.934 --> 20:40.717
Edward.

20:42.110 --> 20:44.068
- I got no service.
- Me, either.

20:44.112 --> 20:47.768
- Oh, no you guys won't
get any reception out here.

20:47.811 --> 20:48.812
- Well it's a good
thing I downloaded

20:48.856 --> 20:51.075
most of my music, so I'm good.

20:51.119 --> 20:52.903
- Hey Scottie,
you ride with Sebastian.

20:52.947 --> 20:54.775
Jamie, you're with me.

20:56.080 --> 20:56.951
- Hold on tight.

20:56.994 --> 20:58.257
It's gonna be a wild ride.

20:58.300 --> 21:00.737
- You're gonna treat us
real good right there.

21:00.781 --> 21:01.303
Yeah.

21:02.348 --> 21:04.219
- We're gonna be ridin'
or we're gonna be dyin'.

21:05.655 --> 21:07.353
- All right. Get
up here all snug.

21:10.094 --> 21:12.923
She may not be the fastest,
but she's the safest.

21:26.981 --> 21:28.678
- Yeah!

21:28.722 --> 21:31.072
♪ Can't back out

21:31.115 --> 21:34.293
♪ 'Cause I'm two feet in

22:26.910 --> 22:28.216
Shut up, everybody shut up.

22:28.259 --> 22:29.043
Gather around, all right?

22:29.086 --> 22:30.697
This is how it works:

22:30.740 --> 22:34.091
the goal is to capture
the yellow flag as always.

22:34.135 --> 22:35.919
But this time it's
gonna be a lot harder.

22:35.963 --> 22:38.182
- Whoa, what do you mean harder?

22:38.226 --> 22:39.358
Are you trying to make it harder

22:39.401 --> 22:40.315
because you're
tired of me winning

22:40.359 --> 22:41.708
or are you just tired of losing?

22:41.751 --> 22:42.926
- Oh, brother, you sound
overconfident, beast.

22:42.970 --> 22:44.319
What's up?
- No, no, no.

22:44.363 --> 22:45.407
I just didn't come
all the way out here

22:45.451 --> 22:47.061
to Redneckville to lose.

22:47.104 --> 22:48.367
Losin' ain't in my playbook.

22:48.410 --> 22:50.020
- No you came out here
for the same reason

22:50.064 --> 22:51.848
all of us came out here for.

22:51.892 --> 22:53.067
- Yeah, and what's that?

22:53.110 --> 22:54.938
- We like to hunt.

22:54.982 --> 22:56.287
So that just means
we love to kill

22:56.331 --> 22:59.378
and there's no greater
thrill than hunting humans.

22:59.421 --> 23:02.119
Of course we can't
actually kill people,

23:02.163 --> 23:03.773
but if you take a hit from
one of these paint guns,

23:03.817 --> 23:05.862
you're gonna wish you were dead.

23:05.906 --> 23:07.516
- I've seen
paintball wars on TV.

23:07.560 --> 23:08.996
Doesn't look like
it hurts that bad.

23:09.039 --> 23:10.345
- Yeah, well, a
normal paintball kit

23:10.389 --> 23:11.477
might feel like a bad bee sting,

23:11.520 --> 23:13.479
but these bad boys right here?

23:13.522 --> 23:15.524
You get tagged with one of these

23:15.568 --> 23:18.135
and it's gonna feel like you
were hit with a sledgehammer.

23:18.179 --> 23:20.964
Four years of college
didn't teach me much,

23:21.008 --> 23:22.270
but what it did
teach me was to apply

23:22.313 --> 23:25.926
what I have learned
to what interests me.

23:26.927 --> 23:28.319
I like to inflict pain.

23:30.104 --> 23:32.846
So I decided to take one of
these little CO2 cartridges

23:32.889 --> 23:35.152
and increase its
power by just a bit.

23:35.196 --> 23:37.938
I mean, to truly appreciate
it, you gotta see it.

23:37.981 --> 23:39.200
Hey Travis, start running.

23:39.243 --> 23:42.116
- What?
- I said start running.

23:42.159 --> 23:42.986
- Yeah.

23:43.030 --> 23:43.813
Go get 'em, right?

23:43.857 --> 23:45.380
Go get 'em, yeah.

23:45.424 --> 23:46.468
- Come on, man.
- Yeah.

23:46.512 --> 23:47.904
- Come on.
- That's what's up!

23:49.558 --> 23:50.385
Will you stand down?

23:50.429 --> 23:51.212
Stand down.

23:51.255 --> 23:52.300
- Come on!

23:53.127 --> 23:55.912
Come on, hot shot,
let's go! Come on!

23:55.956 --> 23:57.131
Come on, big boy!

23:57.174 --> 23:58.480
Come on!

23:58.524 --> 24:00.221
Let's see, you purty, but
can you get a purty shot?

24:00.264 --> 24:01.135
Let's give it to me!

24:01.178 --> 24:02.136
Hit me!

24:06.140 --> 24:08.011
- Hey, Travis?

24:08.055 --> 24:09.926
Come on, wake up.

24:09.970 --> 24:10.797
Wake up.

24:12.538 --> 24:13.364
Wake up.

24:14.931 --> 24:16.150
How'd that feel?

24:16.193 --> 24:18.282
- Um, it felt like I
got my butt kicked.

24:19.153 --> 24:21.155
- That was awesome.

24:21.198 --> 24:23.026
- All right, all
right, is he all right?

24:23.070 --> 24:24.332
Good, good, good.

24:24.375 --> 24:25.507
All right, back to what's
gonna happen tomorrow.

24:25.551 --> 24:27.117
To capture the yellow flag,

24:27.161 --> 24:28.510
not only do we have to
eliminate each other

24:28.554 --> 24:31.165
but there's another
team: a 10 man team

24:31.208 --> 24:33.515
made up of some of the
best from around the world,

24:33.559 --> 24:36.083
and they've already set up
their camp around the perimeter.

24:36.126 --> 24:38.302
They'll be wearing red armbands.

24:38.346 --> 24:40.043
They are professionals.

24:40.087 --> 24:42.132
They've never lost.

24:42.176 --> 24:44.134
But they haven't faced us.

24:44.178 --> 24:48.225
After we eliminate the Red
Team, then you're on your own.

24:48.269 --> 24:49.444
- I wouldn't have
it any other way.

24:49.488 --> 24:50.967
- That's what's up, baby.

24:51.011 --> 24:51.968
All right.

24:52.012 --> 24:53.492
All right, let's go set up camp.

24:53.535 --> 24:57.321
We'll go check out the
rest of the terrain.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.977
- Magazine is good,
but they are no good.

25:01.021 --> 25:02.544
Worthy adversary...

25:02.588 --> 25:04.154
- Who's that?

25:04.198 --> 25:05.155
- That?

25:05.199 --> 25:06.330
That's Sominski.

25:06.374 --> 25:09.203
- He's their best.

25:09.246 --> 25:10.073
- Look.

25:12.380 --> 25:14.295
It is Weekend Warriors.

25:22.433 --> 25:24.174
Pow.

25:56.206 --> 25:57.251
- Hey, Uncle Joey?

25:57.294 --> 25:58.557
- Yeah?

25:58.600 --> 26:00.341
- Yeah, I don't think
Wesley likes us very much.

26:00.384 --> 26:02.299
- Likes us? He hates us.

26:03.431 --> 26:05.433
- Well, Wesley lost
his whole family

26:05.476 --> 26:06.913
when he was real young.

26:06.956 --> 26:08.697
He's been on his own ever since.

26:08.741 --> 26:11.657
You know, but don't mistake
that tough exterior.

26:11.700 --> 26:14.964
His IQ's off the charts,
just like his temper.

26:15.008 --> 26:16.313
- He doesn't have a family?

26:16.357 --> 26:18.185
- These guys are his family now.

26:18.228 --> 26:20.230
- All right,
come on, let's get this.

26:20.274 --> 26:21.362
- Them?

26:21.405 --> 26:22.711
- Hey, give me that
hatchet, numb nuts.

26:22.755 --> 26:24.495
- All right.

26:24.539 --> 26:27.063
Hatchet up something,
huh, tough boy?

26:27.107 --> 26:29.065
- Well, I mean, what
about Sebastian?

26:29.109 --> 26:31.328
- Well, Sebastian and I,
we're the new guys here.

26:31.372 --> 26:33.243
We don't really quite
fit in yet, but,

26:33.287 --> 26:34.331
you know, it's not
really about fitting in.

26:34.375 --> 26:35.594
It's about winning.

26:35.637 --> 26:36.986
- Let's get in here.

26:37.030 --> 26:38.161
I'm gonna take care
of right now, brother.

26:38.205 --> 26:39.293
- Let's see.
- Come on, buddy.

26:39.336 --> 26:40.424
- Come on!

26:46.517 --> 26:48.128
- What's wrong with them?

26:49.477 --> 26:50.652
- That's the McKinley Brothers.

26:50.696 --> 26:52.393
They're about as
country as it gets.

26:52.436 --> 26:53.437
- Come on, come on!

26:53.481 --> 26:55.178
Let's go, let's go!

26:56.702 --> 26:59.269
- But you've never seen
brothers closer than these guys.

26:59.313 --> 27:00.401
And they're both crazy.

27:00.444 --> 27:02.316
Act like 10-year-olds,
but you know,

27:02.359 --> 27:03.665
if I was gonna go to war,

27:03.709 --> 27:06.276
I'd take them with
me every time.

27:06.320 --> 27:07.277
- Them?

27:07.321 --> 27:08.278
- Travis is real
good with blending

27:08.322 --> 27:09.584
into the woods there.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.238
Usually by the time you
see him, it's too late.

27:11.281 --> 27:13.414
And Mike? They call
him the sniper.

27:13.457 --> 27:16.112
He's the best shot in the state.

27:17.070 --> 27:19.246
And Edward back over there,

27:19.289 --> 27:20.682
he's a real smart guy,

27:20.726 --> 27:23.206
but I think he lacks what
it takes to be a leader,

27:23.250 --> 27:25.295
you know, he looks up to Wesley.

27:25.339 --> 27:28.124
Think that's why he follows
him around like a puppy.

27:28.168 --> 27:29.473
And Bull there, after the NFL,

27:29.517 --> 27:31.475
got himself into some trouble

27:31.519 --> 27:34.261
and ended up in prison
but that's where

27:34.304 --> 27:36.306
he met Wesley and
the brothers there.

27:36.350 --> 27:37.351
Here we are.

27:38.439 --> 27:43.009
- So, we're uh, we're pretty
deep in the forest, right?

27:43.052 --> 27:44.271
- Yeah.
- Are they any, like,

27:44.314 --> 27:46.447
wild animals around here?
- Yeah.

27:46.490 --> 27:49.624
Some wolves and coyotes
and mountain lions.

27:49.668 --> 27:53.019
And I've heard that there's
occasionally a grizzly bear.

27:53.062 --> 27:54.324
- Grizzly bear?

27:54.368 --> 27:55.499
- Yeah, but it's highly unlikely

27:55.543 --> 27:57.327
we're gonna come across one.

27:57.371 --> 27:59.416
- Okay but like, what
happens if we do?

27:59.460 --> 28:01.375
- Well, they're most
likely more scared of us

28:01.418 --> 28:02.550
than we are of them.

28:02.593 --> 28:05.031
- Yeah, I wouldn't bet on it.

28:05.074 --> 28:07.163
- Well, if we were
to see a grizzly bear

28:07.207 --> 28:08.730
and if one were
to try to attack,

28:08.774 --> 28:11.167
then what you do is
you pretend to be dead,

28:11.211 --> 28:12.386
because then they
get disinterested

28:12.429 --> 28:15.258
and they leave you alone.

28:15.302 --> 28:18.044
- See Scottie, even the
bear would be bored of you.

28:18.087 --> 28:19.132
- Okay, hey, hey.

28:19.175 --> 28:20.350
We're good.

28:20.394 --> 28:21.569
She and I can take care
of the rest of this.

28:21.612 --> 28:22.396
You know how to use
one of these right here

28:22.439 --> 28:23.353
to start a fire?

28:23.397 --> 28:24.528
- Oh yeah.

28:24.572 --> 28:25.704
- All right. You're
in charge of the fire.

28:25.747 --> 28:27.531
You keep that on you.

28:27.575 --> 28:28.663
All right, you got all
your hooks latched?

28:28.707 --> 28:29.577
- Yep.
- Yeah?

28:29.620 --> 28:31.187
You got everything in there?

28:31.231 --> 28:34.103
All right, yep, undo
that and we'll zip it up.

29:06.222 --> 29:07.615
- Damn,
that's some strong 'shine.

29:07.658 --> 29:08.747
- Yeah.

29:08.790 --> 29:11.488
That's my grandpappy's recipe.

29:12.446 --> 29:14.187
Moonshine.

29:14.230 --> 29:17.103
Run in our blood.

29:17.146 --> 29:17.756
Yeah.

29:20.584 --> 29:23.239
- Here's a gift
for you, princess.

29:23.283 --> 29:24.806
Bottom's up.

29:24.850 --> 29:26.503
Go on.

29:30.594 --> 29:32.814
You all right, Edward?

29:32.858 --> 29:36.644
- Uh, that tastes like,
um, uh, Fireball candy.

29:39.168 --> 29:42.606
- Speaking of candy, I got some.

29:42.650 --> 29:44.652
Anybody want some candy?

29:45.609 --> 29:46.785
- I'll take some.

29:48.482 --> 29:49.570
- Hey Wesley?

29:50.353 --> 29:54.488
Do you remember that
time we was in the yard

29:54.531 --> 29:56.707
and Big Ray come after me?

29:58.318 --> 29:59.710
- I was there.

29:59.754 --> 30:01.800
- Yeah, what happened?

30:01.843 --> 30:02.670
- Well...

30:04.628 --> 30:09.633
Wesley cut off on Big Ray before
he could get to my brother

30:10.373 --> 30:12.549
and he put a beat on
him like I've never seen

30:12.593 --> 30:13.681
a man get beat.

30:15.378 --> 30:17.250
- I thought he was dead.

30:18.817 --> 30:19.730
- He lived.

30:20.906 --> 30:23.865
But he never bothered
me or any of us again.

30:23.909 --> 30:27.608
That's just what one
time Wesley saved us.

30:28.609 --> 30:32.613
- I think I can speak
for all of us when I say

30:32.656 --> 30:36.312
we'd do anything for
that man right there.

30:36.356 --> 30:38.837
- Yeah, I will drink to that.

30:42.014 --> 30:43.493
- Nice, Uncle Joey.

30:43.537 --> 30:45.452
Those are some great
role models for us.

30:45.495 --> 30:47.323
- They've all paid
their debt to society.

30:47.367 --> 30:50.413
Everybody makes
mistakes, all right?

31:00.728 --> 31:01.903
- It's time.

31:01.947 --> 31:03.644
- Kids, I think
it is time to get

31:03.687 --> 31:05.559
everything into the
tent and go to sleep.

31:05.602 --> 31:06.647
- Why?
What's happening.

31:06.690 --> 31:07.866
- Don't worry about it.

31:07.909 --> 31:09.345
It's just a part of
the initiation for us,

31:09.389 --> 31:13.262
uh, so just, I think
it's time to go to bed.

31:13.306 --> 31:14.611
Let's go.

31:17.614 --> 31:18.398
- Let's do it.

31:18.441 --> 31:19.268
Come on.

31:22.054 --> 31:23.577
Come on, get up.

31:24.404 --> 31:26.623
- Oh guys, come on.

31:26.667 --> 31:28.451
Come on now, not
tonight. I'm too tired.

31:28.495 --> 31:29.670
Guys, come on.

31:29.713 --> 31:30.758
No.

31:31.846 --> 31:34.544
- Let's just go to bed.

31:34.588 --> 31:35.676
- Mike, come on.

31:35.719 --> 31:36.546
- Bring it on, come on.

31:36.590 --> 31:37.852
- Set him down.

31:40.376 --> 31:41.769
This brand is a symbol
of our brotherhood.

31:41.812 --> 31:43.727
Are you willing to
sacrifice your burning flesh

31:43.771 --> 31:45.555
to become part of our family?

31:47.427 --> 31:48.645
- Wesley.

31:48.689 --> 31:49.690
Let me go.

31:52.780 --> 31:53.955
Let me go.

31:53.999 --> 31:56.305
- Let him go.

31:58.307 --> 31:59.004
- All right.

32:03.747 --> 32:04.661
- That's it.

32:04.705 --> 32:05.924
- Let's just get it over with.

32:05.967 --> 32:07.577
- That's what I'm talkin' about.

32:07.621 --> 32:10.493
That's what I'm talkin' about.

32:10.537 --> 32:11.668
- Give me a sip.

32:17.979 --> 32:18.806
All right.

32:20.634 --> 32:22.941
- May we be heroes in this life

32:22.984 --> 32:24.768
and great warriors in death.

32:24.812 --> 32:25.856
- All right, just do it.
- Do it!

32:25.900 --> 32:26.683
- Come on.
- Do it!

32:26.727 --> 32:27.728
- Come on.

32:27.771 --> 32:28.598
- Do it.
- Do it!

32:28.642 --> 32:29.512
Yeah, get him, get him.

32:36.998 --> 32:38.391
- You'll never be alone.
- That's it.

32:38.434 --> 32:39.870
- We're your family
now, you understand?

32:39.914 --> 32:40.959
- That's right.

32:41.002 --> 32:42.090
That's right.

32:42.134 --> 32:42.961
Yeah!

32:44.397 --> 32:45.789
- Look at me.

32:45.833 --> 32:48.009
Now you're a man, do
you understand me?

32:48.053 --> 32:50.011
You're one of us!

32:51.447 --> 32:52.971
That's it, that's it.

32:57.671 --> 32:58.933
Have some of that.

33:01.892 --> 33:04.678
That's real 'shine right there.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.724
- I gotta go pee.

33:07.768 --> 33:08.725
- Yeah?

33:08.769 --> 33:09.813
Okay.

33:10.684 --> 33:11.728
I'ma turn in.

33:12.773 --> 33:14.122
- Okay.

33:14.166 --> 33:16.081
- You know I love you, right?

33:16.124 --> 33:18.909
- I love you too, Wesley.

34:09.090 --> 34:09.917
- Lisa.

34:10.787 --> 34:12.789
What happened to you?

34:12.833 --> 34:15.749
- What are you talking about?

34:15.792 --> 34:17.055
- There are marks
all over your back

34:17.098 --> 34:18.056
and I know they're not from me.

34:18.099 --> 34:19.448
Who did this?

34:20.754 --> 34:23.626
Are you cheating on me?
- No.

34:23.670 --> 34:25.846
Hey.
- Who did this to you?

34:28.849 --> 34:31.721
- I, I was walking
back from the woods.

34:34.159 --> 34:35.116
Who's there?

34:38.554 --> 34:42.689
And, and then he just
came out of nowhere.

34:42.732 --> 34:44.082
- What?

34:44.125 --> 34:47.128
- I asked him to stop,
but he was so strong.

34:47.172 --> 34:48.738
- What are you talking about?

34:48.782 --> 34:50.740
- I did everything I could.

34:50.784 --> 34:52.786
- Who did this to you?

34:55.484 --> 34:56.094
- Joey.

35:22.642 --> 35:23.947
- All right, so...

35:27.647 --> 35:28.822
Here's your map.

35:31.564 --> 35:32.652
I know you're gonna win.
- Yeah?

35:32.695 --> 35:34.784
- All right? I'm
rootin' for you.

35:34.828 --> 35:35.829
- Where's Joey at?

35:35.872 --> 35:36.917
- Um...

35:38.005 --> 35:39.180
Well Joey, Sebastian,
and the kids,

35:39.224 --> 35:40.834
I think they left about
a half an hour ago?

35:40.877 --> 35:41.878
- Yeah?

35:41.922 --> 35:43.880
- Everything cool?

35:48.015 --> 35:51.540
- So the Red Team's perimeter
is here, and we are here.

35:51.584 --> 35:54.021
- The yellow flag is
just over the ridge here.

35:54.064 --> 35:54.978
- Okay.

35:55.022 --> 35:55.805
All right.

35:55.849 --> 35:57.546
Okay, great, okay.

35:57.590 --> 35:59.809
You kids, go wait on that
ridge right over there.

35:59.853 --> 36:00.897
You should be able to see

36:00.941 --> 36:01.594
all the action from
there, all right?

36:01.637 --> 36:02.812
- Cool.

36:02.856 --> 36:03.857
- All right.

36:05.772 --> 36:06.642
- Hey.

36:06.686 --> 36:08.296
Can I borrow that?

36:09.993 --> 36:13.519
- Okay, but, promise
you won't break it?

36:14.215 --> 36:15.999
- I promise.

36:16.043 --> 36:17.914
- I got a great
collection of music,

36:17.958 --> 36:19.089
some I even think you'll like.

36:19.133 --> 36:19.960
- Sweet.

36:22.876 --> 36:24.965
- Hey Sebastian?

36:25.008 --> 36:26.227
Good luck.

36:26.271 --> 36:28.055
- You're the one
that's gonna need it.

36:39.066 --> 36:42.025
- Look, it's the flag.
- It means I won.

36:42.069 --> 36:43.113
- No it doesn't.

36:43.157 --> 36:45.681
All right, top of
the hill's up here.

37:02.089 --> 37:04.657
- All right. I see you.

37:41.041 --> 37:42.912
- Hello, Edward.

37:42.956 --> 37:44.653
I'll see you soon.

37:46.133 --> 37:47.003
- I see you, Blue!

37:47.047 --> 37:48.091
I see you!

37:58.754 --> 38:01.061
- So your team's
undefeated, huh?

38:02.323 --> 38:03.281
Not anymore.

38:05.457 --> 38:06.762
- Hey.

38:06.806 --> 38:08.764
Says in the Paintball
Wars handbook,

38:08.808 --> 38:11.289
no physical contact
with the opponent.

38:11.332 --> 38:12.377
- Oh does it now?

38:12.420 --> 38:14.814
- Yeah.

38:14.857 --> 38:16.032
Chapter two, page eight.

38:16.076 --> 38:17.425
- Chapter two, page eight?

38:19.688 --> 38:20.298
Hm.

38:22.822 --> 38:25.825
I must've skipped that page.

38:33.136 --> 38:36.052
- Do we have anyone left
out on the field at all?

38:36.096 --> 38:36.966
- Only one, sir.

38:37.010 --> 38:37.967
Sominski.

38:38.011 --> 38:39.447
- Sominski.

38:39.491 --> 38:40.970
He's the best.

38:41.014 --> 38:43.190
They won't ever catch him.

38:43.233 --> 38:45.235
- I just say get
him on the radio.

38:45.279 --> 38:48.978
Sominski, this is
team leader, copy.

38:49.022 --> 38:50.153
Sominski.

38:50.197 --> 38:52.895
This is team
leader. Do you copy?

38:53.896 --> 38:57.160
Sominiski, this is team
leader, do you copy?

38:57.204 --> 39:00.338
- Red Team leader,
this is Sominski. Over.

39:00.381 --> 39:03.079
- Has your position
been compromised at all?

39:03.123 --> 39:05.343
- Negative Red Team leader.

39:05.386 --> 39:07.257
I have target in sight.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.956
- Watch out for those rednecks.

39:09.999 --> 39:11.131
They're bloody good.

39:12.175 --> 39:13.916
- Don't worry.

39:13.960 --> 39:16.136
They never find me.

39:23.056 --> 39:24.187
- Hello.

39:24.231 --> 39:25.058
Hello?

39:26.059 --> 39:27.800
- Who is this?

39:27.843 --> 39:30.280
- Yeah, this is the
rednecks.

39:30.324 --> 39:32.370
I just wanted to
call and inform you

39:32.413 --> 39:34.763
that we have captured
your last soldier.

39:34.807 --> 39:36.025
Thank you for playin'.

39:36.069 --> 39:37.157
Oh.

39:37.200 --> 39:38.854
You can go home now.

39:50.475 --> 39:51.432
- Wow, look.

39:52.433 --> 39:54.000
- Oh-ho, cool.

39:54.043 --> 39:55.915
Uncle Joey told me about this.

39:55.958 --> 39:57.960
- What does it mean?

39:58.004 --> 40:00.049
- It means that they've
beaten the Red Team now

40:00.093 --> 40:01.529
and they're on their
own to fight each other.

40:01.573 --> 40:03.879
We should be able to see
everything from here.

40:03.923 --> 40:05.098
- Cool.

40:21.810 --> 40:24.465
- It's you and me.

40:24.509 --> 40:27.120
- We're
the last two left.

40:49.185 --> 40:50.186
Woo.

40:51.231 --> 40:52.537
- Yes!
- Yeah.

40:52.580 --> 40:53.494
- Yes!

40:54.974 --> 40:56.149
- You're so dead.

41:01.371 --> 41:02.372
- No, you're dead.

41:28.529 --> 41:30.052
- What happened?

41:31.314 --> 41:32.359
- Justice.

41:32.402 --> 41:33.534
- What are you talkin' about?

41:33.578 --> 41:34.927
- He forced himself
on Lisa, man.

41:34.970 --> 41:36.624
He got what he deserved.

41:46.634 --> 41:48.375
- He's dead.

41:55.164 --> 41:58.124
- I didn't like him anyway.

42:02.171 --> 42:02.998
- Hm.

42:04.304 --> 42:06.219
So what do we do now?

42:08.569 --> 42:11.180
- We can say it was an accident.

42:11.224 --> 42:13.356
- An accident?

42:13.400 --> 42:14.227
No.

42:15.271 --> 42:17.099
I'll be back in jail so fast
it'll make your head swim

42:17.143 --> 42:19.580
and I'm definitely
not going back there.

42:19.624 --> 42:21.364
- Then what?

42:21.408 --> 42:24.019
- Nobody knows we're
out here but us,

42:24.063 --> 42:28.546
so we'll just bury the body
where nobody can find it.

42:28.589 --> 42:31.636
- What about those two brats?

42:31.679 --> 42:35.248
- Oh, we'll have to
get rid of them, too.

42:35.291 --> 42:36.684
- What?

42:36.728 --> 42:38.512
You've gotta think this through.

42:38.556 --> 42:40.558
This is not a good idea.

42:42.690 --> 42:45.345
- I ain't killin' no
innocent kids. No way.

42:47.390 --> 42:49.392
- Where's your loyalty, man?

42:49.436 --> 42:50.655
- With you.

42:50.698 --> 42:52.134
I mean with us.

42:54.136 --> 42:55.398
- Right answer.

42:58.445 --> 43:00.578
- Yeah, yeah, let's
go. Come on, come on.

43:02.362 --> 43:03.232
Come on, let's go.

43:06.279 --> 43:07.672
Come on.

43:10.544 --> 43:13.242
- They've seen everything.

43:13.286 --> 43:14.287
Get 'em!

43:25.994 --> 43:26.604
- Which way?

43:26.647 --> 43:28.127
- Come on.

43:56.590 --> 43:58.679
Wait, wait, wait.

43:58.723 --> 43:59.985
- Get 'em!

44:00.028 --> 44:01.639
- You hear that?

44:01.682 --> 44:02.683
They're close, we have
to hide, we have to hide.

44:02.727 --> 44:03.684
Let's go, come on.

44:03.728 --> 44:08.471
Come on.

44:20.179 --> 44:22.094
- I got you now.

44:30.189 --> 44:31.059
- You all right?

44:31.103 --> 44:33.148
- Yeah.
- You okay?

44:38.850 --> 44:41.374
All right, come on, we gotta go.

44:48.598 --> 44:49.512
- Hey Mike!

44:50.513 --> 44:51.689
- Yeah?

44:51.732 --> 44:53.081
Did you get 'em?

44:53.125 --> 44:55.518
- You better get
over here, brother.

45:02.569 --> 45:03.352
- No, no.

45:03.396 --> 45:04.745
No.

45:08.618 --> 45:10.055
Wake up.

45:10.098 --> 45:10.708
Wake up.

45:12.231 --> 45:13.058
Wake up.

45:14.450 --> 45:16.322
No, brother, wake up.

45:16.365 --> 45:17.715
Wake up, buddy.

45:17.758 --> 45:19.455
- Innocent kids, huh?

45:30.336 --> 45:32.251
- I'm gonna kill those kids.

45:33.643 --> 45:34.862
- Wake up, brother.

45:34.906 --> 45:35.733
Wake up.

45:37.473 --> 45:38.561
He's not dead.

45:38.605 --> 45:39.432
No, no.

45:42.522 --> 45:43.566
Travis!

45:44.524 --> 45:45.351
Travis!

45:57.450 --> 45:59.887
- We need to get warm.

46:02.542 --> 46:04.239
I'm gonna grab some fire wood.

46:04.283 --> 46:06.111
- Okay, hurry. Please.

47:39.552 --> 47:42.729
♪ Happy birthday to you

47:44.557 --> 47:46.559
- Go on, make a wish.

47:47.647 --> 47:48.430
- Yay.

47:48.474 --> 47:49.475
- All right.

47:51.390 --> 47:52.608
- A survival knife?

47:52.652 --> 47:53.914
- Yeah, I had one
when I was a kid.

47:53.958 --> 47:58.310
Not only is it super cool,
it's incredibly handy.

47:58.353 --> 47:59.311
- Thanks, Dad.

47:59.354 --> 48:00.747
- You're welcome.

48:00.790 --> 48:04.359
- All right already,
now let's have some cake.

48:54.627 --> 48:56.629
- This is for you, brother.

49:08.815 --> 49:10.643
- I love you, brother.

50:11.138 --> 50:13.880
- You know what we need to do.

50:16.839 --> 50:18.711
We pledge vengeance.

50:23.846 --> 50:26.806
- I'm gonna kill those
murderin' kids for my brother.

50:26.849 --> 50:28.068
- That's right.

50:30.549 --> 50:34.466
Prepare yourselves tonight.
We leave at sun up.

50:36.903 --> 50:37.730
- Wesley.

50:39.210 --> 50:41.690
Do you honestly think we're
gonna be able to find them?

50:41.734 --> 50:44.911
I mean, there's like a
million places they can hide.

50:44.954 --> 50:47.566
- Yeah, we'll find 'em.

50:47.609 --> 50:48.871
We might not find 'em alive.

50:48.915 --> 50:50.134
With these temperatures
and the wildlife,

50:50.177 --> 50:53.702
they'll be lucky to make
it through the night.

50:56.575 --> 50:57.141
- Hey.

50:58.577 --> 51:00.013
What about Joey's body?

51:00.057 --> 51:01.710
- Edward, get over here.

51:01.754 --> 51:02.929
Get over here!

51:04.931 --> 51:05.932
- What's up?

51:05.975 --> 51:07.151
- You and Edward
go bury the body

51:07.194 --> 51:09.457
where nobody can find it.

51:17.813 --> 51:18.640
Let's go.

51:43.796 --> 51:44.927
- You need to sleep.

51:44.971 --> 51:46.973
- I can't. I'm scared.

51:48.192 --> 51:49.106
- I am, too.

51:51.586 --> 51:53.893
We're gonna be okay.

51:53.936 --> 51:54.720
Here.

51:55.851 --> 51:57.070
Pray with me.

51:57.114 --> 51:59.899
We need all the help we can get.

51:59.942 --> 52:03.772
Dear Lord, please help Jamie
and I to make it home safe.

52:03.816 --> 52:06.079
And please help our mom.

52:06.123 --> 52:09.561
She's probably worried
to death by now.

52:10.997 --> 52:14.957
I know Uncle Joey is up
there with you and Dad now.

52:15.001 --> 52:18.135
And tell him we don't blame
him for what happened,

52:18.178 --> 52:19.962
and that we miss him.

52:23.662 --> 52:25.794
Although we're scared,

52:25.838 --> 52:29.494
our dad taught us
in times of darkness

52:29.537 --> 52:32.105
that we recite
the Lord's Prayer.

52:34.107 --> 52:35.108
Thanks, Dad.

52:37.850 --> 52:39.808
So here it goes.

52:39.852 --> 52:42.115
- Our Father,
who art in Heaven,

52:42.159 --> 52:44.117
hallowed be thy name.

52:44.161 --> 52:47.555
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

52:47.599 --> 52:49.818
on earth as it is in Heaven.

52:49.862 --> 52:53.082
Give us this day
our daily bread...

52:53.126 --> 52:54.823
- And forgive us our tres...

53:32.252 --> 53:33.035
- Hey this is Joey.

53:33.079 --> 53:34.863
You know what to do.

53:34.907 --> 53:35.951
- Hey, Joey, it's Peggy.

53:35.995 --> 53:37.692
Um, you're going
straight to voicemail

53:37.736 --> 53:38.954
and Mom and Dad
aren't picking up.

53:38.998 --> 53:40.565
Can you give me a call, please?

53:40.608 --> 53:42.044
Just getting a little worried.

53:42.088 --> 53:42.915
Thank you.

54:01.063 --> 54:02.151
- What do we do now?

54:02.195 --> 54:05.067
- Well, the best thing to do is

54:05.111 --> 54:09.724
keep as much space between
us and Wesley as possible.

54:11.160 --> 54:12.640
- Where'd you get that?

54:12.684 --> 54:15.121
- Oh, I got it from
Uncle Joey's tent.

54:15.164 --> 54:16.775
Good thing I did.

54:18.820 --> 54:20.735
There should be a highway
right over the hill.

54:20.779 --> 54:21.606
Let's go.

54:30.005 --> 54:31.311
- They're close.

54:32.312 --> 54:34.967
All right, let's go. Come on.

54:40.886 --> 54:42.104
- So, according to the map,

54:42.148 --> 54:44.629
the road should be
right down here.

54:51.766 --> 54:53.290
- What highway? I
don't see a highway.

54:53.333 --> 54:54.987
- God!

54:55.030 --> 54:58.860
- This highway looks like it
hasn't been used in forever.

55:02.473 --> 55:04.170
- It was on the map.

55:05.737 --> 55:07.782
Maybe we'll just wait and
then we can get lucky.

55:07.826 --> 55:09.958
- Or we can just stay
here and die of old age.

55:10.002 --> 55:11.308
- All right, okay?

55:11.351 --> 55:14.746
I just gotta think
of something else.

55:14.789 --> 55:16.138
All right, uh...

55:17.444 --> 55:19.359
What if we just follow the road.

55:19.403 --> 55:21.143
And then we have to
run into somebody.

55:21.187 --> 55:23.407
- Yeah, they call themselves
the Weekend Warriors.

55:23.450 --> 55:25.017
That's a bad idea.

55:25.060 --> 55:28.368
That's the first place
they'll look for us.

55:28.412 --> 55:31.893
- Well, I mean, you are right.

55:34.505 --> 55:37.725
The best thing we can
do is to stay together

55:37.769 --> 55:39.988
and get off the road.

55:40.032 --> 55:40.859
Let's go.

55:57.136 --> 55:58.137
- Hey yo Wesley!

55:58.180 --> 55:59.181
- What's up?

56:00.357 --> 56:02.184
- Looks like they
gone into the river.

56:02.228 --> 56:04.404
- They're trying to
cover their tracks.

56:04.448 --> 56:06.145
Ain't no tellin' when
they'll come out.

56:06.188 --> 56:08.190
- All right, look here.
We need to split up.

56:08.234 --> 56:10.018
Sebastian, you go straight
and you keep to the right

56:10.062 --> 56:12.281
and don't let 'em get by you.

56:12.325 --> 56:13.805
Bull, you take the
terrain up there.

56:13.848 --> 56:15.067
It's not that rough.

56:15.110 --> 56:16.198
The water's gonna push 'em back.

56:16.242 --> 56:18.026
It's gonna help us catch 'em.

56:18.070 --> 56:19.158
- I'm on it!

56:19.201 --> 56:20.246
- Me and Mike are
gonna take the river,

56:20.289 --> 56:21.508
and you and Lisa,
you cross the creek

56:21.552 --> 56:22.814
and you stay to the left,

56:22.857 --> 56:26.078
and do not let them get by you.

56:39.221 --> 56:40.048
Let's go.

56:54.019 --> 56:55.412
- You know we can't
do this, right?

56:55.455 --> 56:57.414
- Yeah, I know, just...

56:57.457 --> 57:00.547
Look, we have to play
along or we're all dead.

57:00.591 --> 57:03.376
- Sooner or later we're
gonna catch up to those kids,

57:03.420 --> 57:05.073
and then what?

57:05.117 --> 57:07.075
- I don't know, I don't know.

57:07.119 --> 57:08.555
I'll think of somethin'.

57:17.042 --> 57:18.391
- Follow
me, they're coming.

57:18.435 --> 57:21.089
- Look. There they are.

57:21.133 --> 57:22.221
- Wait, guys.

57:23.309 --> 57:24.092
Wait.

57:24.136 --> 57:25.137
- We won't hurt you.

57:35.016 --> 57:36.322
- Shoot 'em.

57:36.365 --> 57:37.845
- Hey, hey kid, hey.

57:37.889 --> 57:38.498
Hey, hey.

57:38.542 --> 57:39.543
Hey, no.

57:39.586 --> 57:40.544
Come on.

57:40.587 --> 57:41.893
Come with us.

57:42.937 --> 57:44.243
This?

57:44.286 --> 57:45.374
Don't worry about this.

57:45.418 --> 57:46.898
That's nothing, all right?

57:46.941 --> 57:48.203
Come on.

57:48.247 --> 57:52.904
Just come with us and
you'll be safe, I promise.

57:56.298 --> 57:57.125
Come on.

58:19.234 --> 58:20.409
- Hey Scottie!

58:22.324 --> 58:23.935
Say your prayers!

58:25.284 --> 58:27.329
You gave me no choice.

58:43.128 --> 58:44.869
- No, no!

58:44.912 --> 58:46.131
Come on, hey, come on.

58:46.174 --> 58:48.089
We can make it,
come on! Come on.

58:49.264 --> 58:51.223
- They shot me.

58:51.266 --> 58:52.964
- No, come on, we can make it.

58:53.007 --> 58:53.573
- Run.

58:53.617 --> 58:54.487
Run!

59:08.545 --> 59:11.286
- Look what you made me do!

59:11.330 --> 59:12.374
Get 'em.

59:34.614 --> 59:36.398
- Hey, Chief?

59:36.442 --> 59:37.574
You have three messages.

59:37.617 --> 59:38.966
- Copper Bell?

59:39.010 --> 59:40.054
Did they get my
special 'shine in?

59:40.098 --> 59:41.229
- No.

59:41.273 --> 59:42.491
- Oh.

59:42.535 --> 59:44.276
Oh, no, don't tell
me, Mrs. Hollaway?

59:44.319 --> 59:45.625
What's she want now?

59:45.669 --> 59:47.279
- She said that
some kids snuck in

59:47.322 --> 59:48.585
and stole some apples.

59:48.628 --> 59:50.935
It was like a bushel of
apples from her orchard.

59:50.978 --> 59:52.197
What do you want me to tell her?

59:52.240 --> 59:53.241
- I don't know, Joyce.

59:53.285 --> 59:54.286
Tell her, tell her
I don't have time

59:54.329 --> 59:56.636
to be chasin' apple bandits.

59:56.680 --> 59:57.463
I don't know.

59:57.506 --> 59:58.420
Make up somethin'.

59:58.464 --> 1:00:00.074
- Okay.
- No, no.

1:00:00.118 --> 1:00:02.990
Joyce, she's just gonna
call back again, isn't she?

1:00:03.034 --> 1:00:05.732
- Yeah.
- Oh, okay, tell her...

1:00:05.776 --> 1:00:08.169
Tell her I'll be out
there tomorrow morning.

1:00:08.213 --> 1:00:10.128
- I'm sure she will
love to hear that.

1:00:10.171 --> 1:00:15.176
- And Joyce, have you seen
those Montgomery files anywhere?

1:00:15.481 --> 1:00:16.395
What?

1:00:17.701 --> 1:00:19.354
Oh boy.

1:00:19.398 --> 1:00:22.444
- Should probably slow
down on the 'shine, buddy.

1:00:22.488 --> 1:00:23.489
- Copy that.

1:00:24.490 --> 1:00:25.317
Mm-hm.

1:00:44.336 --> 1:00:46.207
- Hey, can I help you?
- I need some help.

1:00:46.251 --> 1:00:47.295
I need to speak with
a police officer.

1:00:47.339 --> 1:00:48.296
- Oh, over here at the window.

1:00:48.340 --> 1:00:49.384
They can help you.
- Thank you.

1:00:49.428 --> 1:00:50.342
Excuse me?

1:00:50.385 --> 1:00:51.648
Excuse me, I need some help.

1:00:51.691 --> 1:00:53.301
- Okay,
give me a minute.

1:00:53.345 --> 1:00:54.128
- Are you okay?

1:00:54.172 --> 1:00:55.216
- Give you a minute?

1:00:55.260 --> 1:00:56.609
My kids are missing.

1:00:56.653 --> 1:00:59.003
- Hey, can you come over
here and help her right now?

1:00:59.046 --> 1:01:00.439
- Okay, uh, what's this about?

1:01:00.482 --> 1:01:03.398
- I just said my
kids are missing.

1:01:04.661 --> 1:01:06.358
- I'm sorry, excuse me,
what's going on here?

1:01:06.401 --> 1:01:07.315
- My two kids.

1:01:07.359 --> 1:01:08.708
I don't know where they are.

1:01:08.752 --> 1:01:10.144
I went by my parents' house,
there was nobody there,

1:01:10.188 --> 1:01:11.406
I went by the neighbor's house.

1:01:11.450 --> 1:01:13.278
They said the house has
been vacant for days.

1:01:13.321 --> 1:01:14.409
- Chief,
you want me to take

1:01:14.453 --> 1:01:16.324
the report on this one?
- No, I got it.

1:01:16.368 --> 1:01:17.586
What are their names?

1:01:17.630 --> 1:01:19.327
- Scottie and Jamie Kendall.

1:01:19.371 --> 1:01:20.415
- What are their ages?

1:01:20.459 --> 1:01:23.375
Can you tell me what
they were wearing?

1:01:23.418 --> 1:01:26.595
- Scottie is 14 and Jamie's 10.

1:01:26.639 --> 1:01:28.293
Um...

1:01:28.336 --> 1:01:31.165
I think Scottie was wearing
green cargo pants and uh,

1:01:31.209 --> 1:01:32.776
uh, a blue shirt
and a gray hoodie

1:01:32.819 --> 1:01:35.604
and he had his black
baseball cap on.

1:01:35.648 --> 1:01:40.087
Um, Jamie was wearing black
pants and a purple sweater.

1:01:40.131 --> 1:01:41.480
- All right, got it.

1:01:41.523 --> 1:01:43.308
Just calm down now.

1:01:43.351 --> 1:01:45.266
Now when was the last
time you saw 'em?

1:01:45.310 --> 1:01:46.833
- It's been two days
since Joey picked 'em up.

1:01:46.877 --> 1:01:48.139
- Who's Joey?

1:01:48.792 --> 1:01:50.707
- He's my brother.

1:01:50.750 --> 1:01:51.620
- All right.

1:01:51.664 --> 1:01:52.839
So Joey picked 'em up.

1:01:52.883 --> 1:01:54.536
Can you describe the
vehicle he was driving?

1:01:54.580 --> 1:01:58.410
- He's um, he's driving
a white Jeep with big tires.

1:01:58.453 --> 1:02:00.717
- A white Jeep with big tires?

1:02:06.592 --> 1:02:08.202
What's your name?

1:02:08.246 --> 1:02:09.682
- Peggy Kendall.

1:02:09.726 --> 1:02:11.466
I'm their mom.

1:02:11.510 --> 1:02:14.382
- All right, well,
Peggy Kendall, come on.

1:02:14.426 --> 1:02:17.646
Let's figure this out.
- Thank you.

1:02:23.261 --> 1:02:24.436
- Excuse me, ma'am,
would you describe

1:02:24.479 --> 1:02:27.352
that car again, please?

1:02:42.280 --> 1:02:44.543
- Wow, look at it.

1:02:44.586 --> 1:02:45.718
- Nice.

1:02:45.762 --> 1:02:46.588
Come on.

1:02:52.594 --> 1:02:54.335
Ha, looks like your room.

1:02:54.379 --> 1:02:55.728
- Very funny.

1:02:55.772 --> 1:02:59.688
- All right, let's look
around for stuff we can use.

1:03:01.342 --> 1:03:03.823
Oh-oh, sweet, lima
beans and corn.

1:03:03.867 --> 1:03:05.259
You know, I never thought I'd be

1:03:05.303 --> 1:03:08.132
this excited about
lima beans and corn.

1:03:10.917 --> 1:03:13.659
- Oh sleeping bag, I love you.

1:03:16.967 --> 1:03:18.316
- What? What is it?

1:03:18.359 --> 1:03:19.143
- It's in my leg.

1:03:19.186 --> 1:03:19.796
- What is?

1:03:21.275 --> 1:03:22.581
- Rat!
- Oh!

1:03:22.624 --> 1:03:23.495
- Get it off, get it off!
- What, what?

1:03:23.538 --> 1:03:24.148
What do you want me to do?

1:03:24.191 --> 1:03:25.279
- Just kill it!

1:03:25.323 --> 1:03:27.455
- I don't wanna kill it!
- Get it off!

1:03:30.676 --> 1:03:32.199
- That's just a field mouse.

1:03:32.243 --> 1:03:33.505
- Oh.

1:03:33.548 --> 1:03:36.334
- Yeah, but that was gross.

1:03:37.683 --> 1:03:38.771
Are you okay?

1:03:40.338 --> 1:03:42.688
- Besides the fact that we're
being chased by murderers

1:03:42.731 --> 1:03:46.518
and a rodent just tried to
use my pants as its new home?

1:03:46.561 --> 1:03:47.867
I'm fine.

1:03:47.911 --> 1:03:49.651
- So you're okay?

1:03:49.695 --> 1:03:50.783
- Eh.

1:03:50.827 --> 1:03:53.307
- I'll take that as a yes.

1:03:53.351 --> 1:03:56.658
All right, I'll keep
looking for stuff.

1:04:03.622 --> 1:04:04.449
Whoa.

1:04:13.588 --> 1:04:14.676
I can take that.

1:04:14.720 --> 1:04:15.895
- You bets-ta.

1:04:36.307 --> 1:04:37.699
- Let's go back to the campsite.

1:04:37.743 --> 1:04:40.615
I promise I'll make it worth it.

1:04:46.578 --> 1:04:47.535
- No, we're gonna
rest here tonight

1:04:47.579 --> 1:04:50.364
and then we're
gonna go back out.

1:04:50.408 --> 1:04:51.626
It's gonna get
really cold tonight

1:04:51.670 --> 1:04:52.540
and they're gonna
have to build a fire

1:04:52.584 --> 1:04:54.586
if they wanna stay alive.

1:04:57.284 --> 1:04:59.983
We find the fire,
we find the kids.

1:05:07.947 --> 1:05:09.644
- I'm so tired and starving.

1:05:09.688 --> 1:05:11.603
Can we stop and eat
and get some rest?

1:05:11.646 --> 1:05:13.300
- Yeah.

1:05:13.344 --> 1:05:13.953
Here.

1:05:35.627 --> 1:05:36.758
The lid's sharp.

1:05:48.770 --> 1:05:50.990
- Do you think
anyone will find us?

1:05:51.034 --> 1:05:52.339
- Are you kidding me?

1:05:52.383 --> 1:05:53.950
You know mom is worried
to death by now.

1:05:53.993 --> 1:05:56.039
She probably has everybody
in the state looking for us.

1:05:56.082 --> 1:05:58.650
- Yeah, but, no one
knows we're here but us.

1:05:58.693 --> 1:06:01.914
She thinks we're at
Grandma and Grandpa's.

1:06:01.958 --> 1:06:03.655
- We'll be fine.

1:06:03.698 --> 1:06:05.700
- I'm so tired.

1:06:05.744 --> 1:06:07.354
- Why don't you get some rest

1:06:07.398 --> 1:06:11.054
while I go out and get
some firewood for tonight?

1:06:13.012 --> 1:06:15.972
- Dad would've
been proud of you.

1:06:16.015 --> 1:06:16.842
- Thanks.

1:06:49.657 --> 1:06:50.484
- Jaime?

1:07:20.558 --> 1:07:21.733
- Jaime!

1:07:21.776 --> 1:07:23.126
Leave her alone!

1:07:40.491 --> 1:07:41.709
- Scottie?

1:07:41.753 --> 1:07:42.710
Scottie.

1:07:53.765 --> 1:07:54.809
Scottie.

1:07:56.942 --> 1:07:58.683
- If we were to
see a grizzly bear

1:07:58.726 --> 1:08:00.119
and if one were
to try to attack,

1:08:00.163 --> 1:08:02.600
then what you do is
you pretend to be dead,

1:08:02.643 --> 1:08:07.648
'cause then they get
disinterested and
they leave you alone.

1:08:48.820 --> 1:08:50.822
- Jaime, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.

1:08:50.865 --> 1:08:52.040
Oh.
- Scottie!

1:08:53.172 --> 1:08:54.782
I thought you were dead.

1:08:54.826 --> 1:08:57.002
- Eh, it's just a
mean old grizzly bear.

1:08:57.045 --> 1:08:59.787
Nothing I couldn't handle.

1:08:59.831 --> 1:09:00.962
- Your arm.

1:09:02.616 --> 1:09:03.922
- Yeah. He got me.

1:09:05.663 --> 1:09:07.969
He got me pretty good.

1:09:08.013 --> 1:09:11.103
- Here.

1:09:11.147 --> 1:09:11.973
Lay down.

1:09:13.149 --> 1:09:13.975
- Yeah.

1:09:16.717 --> 1:09:17.979
Yeah.

1:09:18.023 --> 1:09:20.634
Maybe just for a minute.

1:09:20.678 --> 1:09:22.810
I'm gonna close my eyes.

1:09:22.854 --> 1:09:24.160
- Scottie?

1:09:24.203 --> 1:09:25.030
Scottie?

1:09:35.214 --> 1:09:36.128
- What the?

1:09:38.217 --> 1:09:39.827
Did you do all this?

1:09:39.871 --> 1:09:41.220
- I cleaned you up.

1:09:41.264 --> 1:09:43.179
You had blood all over you.

1:09:43.222 --> 1:09:47.008
And let me tell you,
red is not your color.

1:09:47.052 --> 1:09:50.055
Believe it or not, I was
also paying attention

1:09:50.098 --> 1:09:52.188
when Dad was showing
you first aid.

1:09:52.231 --> 1:09:55.060
And I watch tons
of survival shows.

1:09:55.103 --> 1:09:56.931
I know what you're thinking,

1:09:56.975 --> 1:10:00.021
how can I be so
beautiful and smart, too?

1:10:00.065 --> 1:10:01.936
I don't know. I just am.

1:10:01.980 --> 1:10:03.982
It's crazy, right?

1:10:04.025 --> 1:10:05.288
- What's up with
the taking my shoes?

1:10:05.331 --> 1:10:06.854
- I'll explain later.

1:10:06.898 --> 1:10:07.725
Look.

1:10:08.943 --> 1:10:10.336
The deeper we go into the woods,

1:10:10.380 --> 1:10:12.730
the less likely we make
it out of here alive.

1:10:12.773 --> 1:10:15.167
- Okay, so what do you suggest?

1:10:16.299 --> 1:10:18.692
- We have to make it here.

1:10:19.780 --> 1:10:22.696
- Okay, to make it there we
have to go by their camp site.

1:10:22.740 --> 1:10:24.220
And when we get there
we have at least

1:10:24.263 --> 1:10:25.699
10 miles to the road.

1:10:25.743 --> 1:10:27.223
- I know that.

1:10:27.266 --> 1:10:28.833
- So how are we gonna do that?

1:10:28.876 --> 1:10:30.356
- We'll backtrack.

1:10:30.400 --> 1:10:32.053
We'll walk along the bank of
the stream until we pass them.

1:10:32.097 --> 1:10:33.011
- Okay.

1:10:33.054 --> 1:10:35.231
Uh, let's suppose that works,

1:10:35.274 --> 1:10:37.145
and we make it
back to their camp.

1:10:37.189 --> 1:10:39.322
We still have at least
10 miles until the road.

1:10:39.365 --> 1:10:41.193
- Once we get to camp
it should be empty

1:10:41.237 --> 1:10:43.935
except for the tents
and four wheelers.

1:10:43.978 --> 1:10:45.763
- How did you come
up with all this?

1:10:45.806 --> 1:10:49.027
- I may be a kid,
but I am not stupid.

1:10:49.070 --> 1:10:49.941
- Let's go.

1:11:18.665 --> 1:11:19.971
Let's go, come on.

1:11:30.938 --> 1:11:34.072
So, what happens when they find
where we camped last night?

1:11:34.115 --> 1:11:35.900
You know they're
gonna track us here.

1:11:35.943 --> 1:11:37.771
They always do.

1:11:37.815 --> 1:11:42.080
- Big brother, as always,
you underestimate me.

1:11:48.478 --> 1:11:51.655
♪ And your arm bone

1:11:58.009 --> 1:11:59.445
- Yo.
- What's up?

1:11:59.489 --> 1:12:01.012
- They played us.

1:12:01.055 --> 1:12:02.230
- What are
you talking about?

1:12:02.274 --> 1:12:03.144
- We've been here already, man.

1:12:03.188 --> 1:12:05.364
We're going in circles.

1:12:05.408 --> 1:12:09.760
- Wesley, seriously
man, we can just let them go.

1:12:13.154 --> 1:12:14.286
- Anybody here wanna back out,

1:12:14.330 --> 1:12:16.854
let him or her say right now.

1:12:16.897 --> 1:12:18.203
- They deserve
what's comin' to 'em

1:12:18.246 --> 1:12:20.988
for killin' my brother.

1:12:21.032 --> 1:12:24.078
- See, he wasn't
just your brother.

1:12:24.122 --> 1:12:26.167
We're all brothers
and sisters here.

1:12:26.211 --> 1:12:28.082
That's what this means.

1:12:30.258 --> 1:12:32.086
And if you're not a
part of this family...

1:12:32.130 --> 1:12:33.174
- Hey.

1:12:33.218 --> 1:12:34.001
- Then you're a traitor.

1:12:34.045 --> 1:12:35.046
- Listen, Bull.
- Mm-mm.

1:12:35.089 --> 1:12:36.177
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

1:12:36.221 --> 1:12:38.441
Now we can take care
of that right now.

1:12:38.484 --> 1:12:39.355
- Mm-hm.

1:12:39.398 --> 1:12:40.747
- Bull, Bull?

1:12:40.791 --> 1:12:41.400
Hey?

1:12:42.314 --> 1:12:43.924
You guys are right.

1:12:43.968 --> 1:12:45.317
Um, I'm sorry. I don't
know what I was thinkin'.

1:12:45.361 --> 1:12:48.015
Just, I'm on board with
you guys, just relax, okay?

1:12:48.059 --> 1:12:49.190
Relax.

1:12:49.234 --> 1:12:51.018
We'll find 'em. I'm on board.

1:12:51.062 --> 1:12:52.106
You're right.

1:13:00.201 --> 1:13:04.031
- They're goin' for
the four-wheelers.

1:13:04.075 --> 1:13:05.946
- How do you know that?

1:13:07.426 --> 1:13:10.168
- Because it's
their only chance.

1:13:25.096 --> 1:13:29.317
- We need to find some
keys. Go in Wesley's tent.

1:13:39.284 --> 1:13:41.504
Thank you, Uncle Joey.

1:13:41.547 --> 1:13:44.245
I got the keys, let's go.

1:14:09.314 --> 1:14:10.097
- Give me the keys.

1:14:10.141 --> 1:14:11.142
- I can't let you do it.

1:14:11.185 --> 1:14:13.057
I can't let you kill those kids.

1:14:13.100 --> 1:14:14.450
- Give me the keys!

1:14:14.493 --> 1:14:15.320
- No!

1:14:53.184 --> 1:14:55.099
- Come on, go faster! Come on!

1:15:07.590 --> 1:15:09.287
- You're dead.

1:15:10.984 --> 1:15:12.290
- Jaime!

1:15:12.333 --> 1:15:13.160
Just breathe.

1:15:13.204 --> 1:15:15.206
Come on, breathe.

1:15:15.249 --> 1:15:17.513
Breathe, just breathe. Come on.

1:15:17.556 --> 1:15:19.602
Come on, stay with
me, breathe. Come on.

1:15:22.300 --> 1:15:23.344
Come on.

1:15:25.085 --> 1:15:25.869
Breathe.

1:15:25.912 --> 1:15:27.392
Breathe. Come on.

1:15:47.630 --> 1:15:49.240
- Bull, you good?

1:15:49.283 --> 1:15:50.067
- I'm good, man.

1:15:50.110 --> 1:15:51.198
Go get them kids, man!

1:15:51.242 --> 1:15:53.200
- Let's go, let's go!

1:15:57.944 --> 1:15:58.554
- Ah!

1:16:00.294 --> 1:16:01.557
We're outta gas.

1:16:03.384 --> 1:16:05.386
- Do you see them?

1:16:05.430 --> 1:16:06.213
- No.

1:16:06.257 --> 1:16:07.563
I think we lost 'em.

1:16:07.606 --> 1:16:10.217
Come on, we gotta keep goin'.

1:16:11.305 --> 1:16:12.219
Come on, come on.

1:16:12.263 --> 1:16:13.133
All right, we gotta go. Come on.

1:16:30.629 --> 1:16:31.412
- Anything?

1:16:31.456 --> 1:16:33.110
- No, nothing yet.

1:16:40.334 --> 1:16:42.293
- Come on, come on.

1:16:42.336 --> 1:16:44.556
Come here, come here.

1:16:49.517 --> 1:16:52.216
We gotta go, right here.

1:16:52.259 --> 1:16:53.478
Okay, let's go.

1:16:53.521 --> 1:16:54.348
- Stop.

1:16:54.392 --> 1:16:56.263
I need to rest.

1:16:56.307 --> 1:16:58.091
- Hey, hey, hey, it's all right.

1:16:58.135 --> 1:17:00.528
Hey, hey, hey.

1:17:00.572 --> 1:17:01.660
Hey, look at me.

1:17:01.704 --> 1:17:02.618
Look at me.

1:17:04.228 --> 1:17:05.011
It's gonna be all right.

1:17:05.055 --> 1:17:06.360
All right?

1:17:12.323 --> 1:17:14.455
All right, I'm gonna try
to take it out, all right?

1:17:14.499 --> 1:17:17.284
- Please make the pain go away.

1:17:17.328 --> 1:17:19.286
- All right, on three.

1:17:19.330 --> 1:17:20.723
One...

1:17:20.766 --> 1:17:21.680
Two...

1:17:21.724 --> 1:17:22.507
Three.

1:17:30.733 --> 1:17:32.343
I can't get it out.

1:17:38.262 --> 1:17:41.221
Come on, we gotta keep going.

1:17:41.265 --> 1:17:42.309
Okay, let's go.

1:17:42.353 --> 1:17:44.094
Come on.

1:17:44.137 --> 1:17:47.314
Let's go, come on, come on.

1:18:05.332 --> 1:18:06.638
- Which way?

1:18:06.682 --> 1:18:09.423
I think they either
went over or around.

1:18:09.467 --> 1:18:10.686
- I'm gonna go
up, you go around.

1:18:10.729 --> 1:18:11.643
Move it!

1:18:11.687 --> 1:18:14.385
Let's go!

1:18:36.276 --> 1:18:37.408
- I got you now.

1:18:51.378 --> 1:18:53.293
- Nowhere to go but up.

1:19:10.441 --> 1:19:12.748
- Bring your arm
here up, come on.

1:19:18.797 --> 1:19:19.755
You all right?
- Yeah.

1:19:19.798 --> 1:19:21.408
I'm okay.
- Come on.

1:19:26.109 --> 1:19:27.763
We can camp here for the night.

1:19:27.806 --> 1:19:30.461
That'll give you enough time
to regain strength, all right?

1:19:30.504 --> 1:19:32.506
- No, you have to go without me.

1:19:32.550 --> 1:19:33.769
- No.

1:19:33.812 --> 1:19:37.555
Mm-mm, I'm not leaving
you. It's not an option.

1:19:39.644 --> 1:19:40.471
All right.

1:19:41.428 --> 1:19:43.779
I'm gonna go get some firewood.

1:19:43.822 --> 1:19:44.823
Hey.

1:19:44.867 --> 1:19:46.520
You're all right.

1:19:46.564 --> 1:19:47.608
Okay?

1:20:14.331 --> 1:20:16.159
- I got you, I got you!

1:20:16.202 --> 1:20:17.638
I got you.

1:20:17.682 --> 1:20:18.814
I got you!

1:20:18.857 --> 1:20:20.467
- Help, Scottie, help.

1:20:20.511 --> 1:20:22.818
- Yeah, Scottie, help.

1:20:24.602 --> 1:20:25.777
Help, Scottie.

1:20:27.910 --> 1:20:29.476
Come out!

1:20:31.391 --> 1:20:34.525
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

1:20:35.395 --> 1:20:37.658
I know you can hear me.

1:20:37.702 --> 1:20:39.660
Are you listening?

1:20:39.704 --> 1:20:42.968
This sweet little, young,
little innocent girl.

1:20:43.012 --> 1:20:44.840
Yeah, Scottie.

1:20:44.883 --> 1:20:46.929
She has her whole
life ahead of her.

1:20:46.972 --> 1:20:48.931
What are you gonna do?

1:20:48.974 --> 1:20:51.542
- Don't do it, Scottie. Run.

1:20:51.585 --> 1:20:53.457
- I'll tell you what.

1:20:53.500 --> 1:20:56.416
I'll tell you what, Scottie.

1:20:59.898 --> 1:21:02.509
I'll spare her life for yours.

1:21:05.643 --> 1:21:09.516
If you're not out on here
on the count of three,

1:21:09.560 --> 1:21:10.953
well let's just say
sweet little Jaime

1:21:10.996 --> 1:21:13.259
is gonna be joining Joey!

1:21:15.653 --> 1:21:16.872
It's your choice!

1:21:18.482 --> 1:21:19.309
One...

1:21:21.572 --> 1:21:22.573
Two...

1:21:22.616 --> 1:21:23.617
- Don't do it, Scottie!

1:21:23.661 --> 1:21:24.923
Run!

1:21:24.967 --> 1:21:25.793
- Three!

1:21:25.837 --> 1:21:26.664
- Wait!

1:21:28.579 --> 1:21:29.885
No one else has to die.

1:21:29.928 --> 1:21:32.713
- Oh, you're wrong about that.

1:21:33.801 --> 1:21:34.890
Drop the gun.

1:21:36.369 --> 1:21:37.370
I'll finish her right here.

1:21:37.414 --> 1:21:38.284
You know I'll do it.

1:21:38.328 --> 1:21:40.591
I got nothin' to lose, man.

1:21:44.421 --> 1:21:45.683
- Don't do it, Scottie.

1:21:45.726 --> 1:21:46.727
Run.

1:21:54.039 --> 1:21:54.866
- Time is up.

1:21:54.910 --> 1:21:56.650
- Okay, all right.

1:21:56.694 --> 1:21:57.608
What do you want me to do?

1:21:57.651 --> 1:21:59.305
- Toss me the gun.

1:22:02.004 --> 1:22:04.571
Go over there to your brother.

1:22:05.746 --> 1:22:07.618
I'm sorry it's
gotta end like this.

1:22:07.661 --> 1:22:10.577
Just at the wrong place
at the wrong time.

1:22:38.779 --> 1:22:41.913
- Joey never even touched me.

1:22:41.957 --> 1:22:43.915
I was with Edward.

1:22:43.959 --> 1:22:46.309
I love him, and now
you're never gonna

1:22:46.352 --> 1:22:48.311
hurt anyone ever again.

1:22:53.707 --> 1:22:54.665
- It's okay.

1:23:11.769 --> 1:23:12.552
Hey!

1:23:16.687 --> 1:23:17.514
Hey!

1:23:19.820 --> 1:23:21.648
- Air base to one,
this is Chief Baumgardner.

1:23:21.692 --> 1:23:22.998
I think we found them.

1:23:23.041 --> 1:23:25.000
We're preparing to land.

1:23:29.482 --> 1:23:31.006
- Oh my god.

1:23:31.049 --> 1:23:32.094
- May have some injuries.

1:23:32.137 --> 1:23:34.661
Have a couple of
ambulances on stand by.

1:23:34.705 --> 1:23:35.619
Roger, out.

1:23:45.063 --> 1:23:46.412
On the ground!

1:23:47.979 --> 1:23:49.111
On the ground!

1:23:50.851 --> 1:23:51.852
Do not move.

1:24:21.795 --> 1:24:22.883
- Mom!

1:24:25.843 --> 1:24:26.931
- Are you okay?

1:24:26.974 --> 1:24:28.889
- I'm all right.
- You hurt?

1:24:28.933 --> 1:24:30.065
What happened to your arm?

1:24:30.108 --> 1:24:30.891
- Don't worry.

1:24:30.935 --> 1:24:32.545
Jaime took care of me.

1:24:32.589 --> 1:24:35.809
Besides, you wouldn't
believe me if I told you.

1:24:35.853 --> 1:24:36.854
- Oh, Jaime.

1:24:39.248 --> 1:24:41.772
- All right, very careful now.

1:24:41.815 --> 1:24:43.643
Step down, that's it, good girl.

1:24:43.687 --> 1:24:44.775
Oh.

1:24:45.776 --> 1:24:46.733
- Jaime.

1:24:46.777 --> 1:24:47.778
Oh, baby.

1:24:49.780 --> 1:24:50.824
- Mom.

1:24:50.868 --> 1:24:52.696
- Are you okay?

1:24:52.739 --> 1:24:53.566
Oh, god.

1:24:54.872 --> 1:24:56.613
Is she gonna be okay?

1:24:57.527 --> 1:24:58.963
Oh.
- She's a tough one.

1:24:59.006 --> 1:24:59.833
- Baby.

1:25:59.023 --> 1:25:59.806
- Hey.

1:25:59.850 --> 1:26:00.981
- Hey Chief.

1:26:01.025 --> 1:26:01.939
- Hey Scottie,
how are you doing?

1:26:01.982 --> 1:26:03.158
- I'm good.

1:26:03.201 --> 1:26:04.202
Everything's finally
getting back to normal.

1:26:04.246 --> 1:26:05.203
- Oh that's good news.

1:26:05.247 --> 1:26:06.900
Good, good.

1:26:06.944 --> 1:26:08.163
- Well what do we
owe the pleasure?

1:26:08.206 --> 1:26:10.165
- Oh, I just happened
to be in your fine city

1:26:10.208 --> 1:26:11.905
and I thought I'd
stop by, check in,

1:26:11.949 --> 1:26:14.821
see how things are goin'.

1:26:14.865 --> 1:26:15.822
How's Jaime?

1:26:16.954 --> 1:26:19.043
- Well she's getting
on my last nerve,

1:26:19.086 --> 1:26:20.827
but I wouldn't have
it any other way?

1:26:20.871 --> 1:26:22.177
- Good.

1:26:22.220 --> 1:26:23.265
Well, yeah...

1:26:24.918 --> 1:26:26.311
I just wanted to
say spending time

1:26:26.355 --> 1:26:28.095
with you and your sister
over the last couple of weeks

1:26:28.139 --> 1:26:30.097
has been really good for me.

1:26:30.141 --> 1:26:30.968
I uh...

1:26:32.883 --> 1:26:37.061
In you kids I see my
grandkids and I lost them

1:26:37.104 --> 1:26:38.976
a couple of years ago.

1:26:39.019 --> 1:26:42.719
They're in heaven now,
and uh, I miss 'em.

1:26:45.025 --> 1:26:46.026
So I was thinking
that, you know,

1:26:46.070 --> 1:26:47.941
if it's all right
with all of you,

1:26:47.985 --> 1:26:50.640
maybe I could every now
and then stop by, check in,

1:26:50.683 --> 1:26:51.945
see how you're doin'?

1:26:51.989 --> 1:26:52.859
- Scottie?

1:26:52.903 --> 1:26:53.817
- Yeah.

1:26:53.860 --> 1:26:54.905
That'd be cool. I'd like that.

1:26:54.948 --> 1:26:55.949
- Me, too.

1:26:55.993 --> 1:26:56.950
- Me three.

1:26:56.994 --> 1:26:59.649
- Besides, you saved my kids.

1:26:59.692 --> 1:27:01.912
- Oh, I didn't save 'em.

1:27:01.955 --> 1:27:03.783
They saved themselves.

1:27:04.915 --> 1:27:07.047
- Well, you brought
them home to me,

1:27:07.091 --> 1:27:09.876
and for that, I'm
forever grateful.

1:27:09.920 --> 1:27:11.313
You are always welcome.

1:27:11.356 --> 1:27:12.662
- Oh, thank you.

1:27:12.705 --> 1:27:14.011
- Thank you.

1:27:14.054 --> 1:27:15.839
- Hey, let me get in on that.

1:27:15.882 --> 1:27:16.883
- Oh absolutely.

1:27:16.927 --> 1:27:17.884
Oh, boy.

1:27:17.928 --> 1:27:19.756
Watch that arm.

1:27:19.799 --> 1:27:21.627
You guys are the best.

1:27:24.282 --> 1:27:25.979
- Where are you off to?

1:27:26.023 --> 1:27:27.633
- Oh don't worry about me.

1:27:27.677 --> 1:27:29.026
I'll be right back.

1:27:29.069 --> 1:27:31.202
I have some unfinished
business to attend to.

1:27:31.246 --> 1:27:32.899
- Oh.
- Chief.

1:27:32.943 --> 1:27:35.075
- I got your back.

1:27:35.119 --> 1:27:36.729
- Yeah, I got yours, too.

1:27:39.950 --> 1:27:40.907
- Would you like to come in?

1:27:40.951 --> 1:27:42.648
- Oh...

1:27:42.692 --> 1:27:43.388
That'd be nice.

1:27:43.432 --> 1:27:44.694
- Come on in.

1:27:45.956 --> 1:27:47.174
- What's
your problem Amy?

1:27:47.218 --> 1:27:48.915
- I don't have a
problem. You're mine.

1:27:48.959 --> 1:27:50.265
- Well come
on, let's just go.

1:27:50.308 --> 1:27:52.049
- I don't wanna
go on a ride with you.

1:27:52.092 --> 1:27:53.703
- Whoa.

1:27:53.746 --> 1:27:54.747
- Just get out of my way.

1:27:54.791 --> 1:27:55.705
- Calm down.
- Stop.

1:27:55.748 --> 1:27:58.055
My parents are waiting for me.

1:28:01.363 --> 1:28:03.365
Mickey, can you move so
I can get into my house?

1:28:03.408 --> 1:28:05.236
- Come on Amy, let's
take a ride on your bike.

1:28:05.280 --> 1:28:07.412
- I don't wanna take a ride
on my bike, I wanna go home.

1:28:07.456 --> 1:28:08.370
Just get out of my way.

1:28:08.413 --> 1:28:09.806
- What is your problem?

1:28:09.849 --> 1:28:10.633
- I don't want to-
- Hey, is there

1:28:10.676 --> 1:28:12.678
a problem here?

1:28:12.722 --> 1:28:14.898
- The only problem is you.

1:28:16.247 --> 1:28:18.380
Beat if before I beat you.

1:28:24.299 --> 1:28:25.778
Come on Amy, let's
just go to the park.

1:28:25.822 --> 1:28:26.649
- I don't want to
go to the park.

1:28:26.692 --> 1:28:28.041
I just wanna go inside.

1:28:28.085 --> 1:28:29.695
I don't want you
to go in with me.

1:28:29.739 --> 1:28:30.827
Can you just let me go by?

1:28:30.870 --> 1:28:32.350
- Amy.
- Okay, just leave her alone.

1:28:32.394 --> 1:28:33.873
- I warned ya.

1:28:34.831 --> 1:28:35.658
- Scottie!

1:28:35.701 --> 1:28:36.354
Hey.

1:28:36.398 --> 1:28:37.964
Hey.

1:28:38.008 --> 1:28:38.791
Okay.

1:28:38.835 --> 1:28:40.271
Here.

1:28:40.315 --> 1:28:42.229
- Wait, wait.

1:28:47.844 --> 1:28:49.324
- You've had this
the whole time?

1:28:49.367 --> 1:28:50.194
- Yeah.

1:28:52.805 --> 1:28:55.852
It may sound silly,
but it kept me alive.

1:28:56.809 --> 1:28:59.943
- What are you doing
with that loser anyway?

1:28:59.986 --> 1:29:02.902
- The only loser here is you.

1:29:05.470 --> 1:29:06.689
- Hey.

1:29:20.137 --> 1:29:21.138
- Hey, wait.

1:29:24.446 --> 1:29:27.144
