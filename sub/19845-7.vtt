Hey, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, come on!

00:41.546 --> 00:44.901
Okay, Philly, explain it
to me very slowly.

00:44.936 --> 00:46.359
Start from the beginning.

00:46.771 --> 00:49.372
If I have five apples,

00:49.407 --> 00:51.040
then I give away three of the apples,

00:51.075 --> 00:53.008
- how many's left?
- Wait, wait, wait.

00:53.033 --> 00:54.351
- What?
- You give away three?

00:54.367 --> 00:56.533
- Yeah, I give away three of 'em.
- To who?

00:56.569 --> 00:58.469
I don't know. It doesn't
say it in the thing.

00:58.504 --> 01:00.249
You're just walking around
giving people your apples?

01:00.273 --> 01:02.907
I think, maybe, it's just,
like, a hypothetical.

01:02.942 --> 01:05.342
Listen, Philly, let me tell you
something about life, okay?

01:05.378 --> 01:06.688
You got five apples
in your pocket... (snaps)

01:06.712 --> 01:08.957
...keep 'em in your goddamn pocket.
Don't give 'em to anybody.

01:08.981 --> 01:10.968
- But, Johnny, I think it's just...
- Five, the answer's five.

01:10.984 --> 01:13.217
No, okay, I'll write down five.

01:13.252 --> 01:14.652
(sniffs) Hey, Johnny?

01:14.688 --> 01:17.256
I can't wait to grows up
and be just like you.

01:17.281 --> 01:20.382
Whoa, whoa. Wait, listen, kid.
We're different, okay?

01:20.417 --> 01:23.185
Your destiny is something
much bigger, you know.

01:23.221 --> 01:24.987
Going to college, being a real man.

01:25.022 --> 01:27.421
That's what Pop wanted,
that's what Mom wanted.

01:27.457 --> 01:29.090
- Hey, Johnny?
- Yeah?

01:29.126 --> 01:31.890
Do we ever gonna see Mom...
Mom and Dad again?

01:32.629 --> 01:34.395
Yeah, you know, we see 'em every day.

01:34.430 --> 01:37.165
I see 'em every day. I feel 'em
every day. They're everywhere.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.566
They're here right now.

01:38.601 --> 01:40.101
I feel 'em too, Johnny.

01:40.137 --> 01:43.036
Good. That's why you gotta
study, do your homework,

01:43.072 --> 01:44.832
and keep those fucking
apples in your pocket.

01:45.367 --> 01:46.439
(panting)

01:46.475 --> 01:48.175
We in big fucking trouble, Johnny!

01:48.210 --> 01:50.077
They chopped my
fuckin' ear off, Johnny!

01:50.112 --> 01:52.545
Those motherfuckers!
They cut Mikey's fuckin' ear.

01:52.581 --> 01:54.492
- They chopped my goddamn ear off.
- Mike, relax, all right.

01:54.516 --> 01:56.327
Not in front of the kid.
What the fuck are you doing?

01:56.351 --> 01:58.351
Is music ever gonna
sound the same, Johnny?

01:58.387 --> 01:59.419
Will you relax?

01:59.454 --> 02:01.030
Pussy, bring him in the back.

02:01.070 --> 02:02.805
- Pussy, get him in the back!
- All right, all right.

02:02.829 --> 02:03.805
Mikey, sit down, sit down.

02:03.847 --> 02:05.747
- Ow, it hurts.
- Michael, please.

02:05.775 --> 02:07.653
- You got germs in your fuckin' ear.
- Don't touch it.

02:07.677 --> 02:09.911
No, seriously, it fuckin' hurts.
Stop! Stop, stop, stop.

02:09.946 --> 02:12.608
- What is the situation?
- Alabaster.

02:12.992 --> 02:16.894
Him and his crew, they stopped
me outside the Mulberry Bakery,

02:16.929 --> 02:19.529
and I guess they heard
how much we was bringin' in.

02:19.564 --> 02:20.349
Hey, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:20.374 --> 02:22.682
Alabaster's crew is in Little Italy?

02:22.717 --> 02:24.583
That's what I said, Johnny.

02:24.618 --> 02:26.656
They're crossing territorial lines.
They can't do that.

02:26.680 --> 02:29.066
Look at what he did to my fuckin' ear!
They're fuckin' crazy!

02:29.090 --> 02:30.261
Yeah, I saw the fuckin' ear.

02:30.286 --> 02:31.401
- Will you relax?
- (screams)

02:31.425 --> 02:33.159
- Mikey, shut the fuck up.
- (wails)

02:33.194 --> 02:34.659
- Sit down. Sit down.
- Ow! My ear!

02:34.695 --> 02:35.805
All right, all right, all right!

02:35.829 --> 02:39.030
Listen, we need
a face-to-face, tonight.

02:39.066 --> 02:41.933
Their crew, our crew.
Somewhere neutral.

02:41.968 --> 02:44.769
Uh, Pier One, the nice one.

02:44.805 --> 02:46.843
Hey, Chops, let 'em know.

02:48.041 --> 02:51.077
Sal, Tommy, come on, let's go.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

02:51.343 --> 02:52.159
Johnny, can I come...

02:52.184 --> 02:53.695
- Can I come with you guys?
- No, no way!

02:53.719 --> 02:55.460
- What did we just talk about?
- I can help out.

02:55.484 --> 02:57.218
Did you listen to anything I just said?
No, it's too dangerous.

02:57.242 --> 02:59.312
I do listen to you, Johnny.
Johnny, it's not dangerous.

02:59.336 --> 03:00.898
- Johnny, I'm tough, come on.
- That's it, that's it, kid.

03:00.922 --> 03:02.375
I didn't want to do it,
now I'm gonna do it.

03:02.399 --> 03:03.906
- What are you? ...No!
- I gotta put you in your place.

03:03.930 --> 03:05.949
Not the scruff. Ow, ow!
Get off of me, Johnny!

03:05.984 --> 03:07.504
Now get in your goddamn bed, let's go.

03:07.531 --> 03:08.845
Johnny, I'm not a little baby anymore.

03:08.869 --> 03:10.514
- You can't scruff me.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

03:10.538 --> 03:12.418
Johnny, let me out of the room.
Johnny, come on.

03:12.460 --> 03:13.902
I'm sorry, Philly, I can't do that.

03:13.937 --> 03:15.436
Let me out. Let me out!

03:15.472 --> 03:18.272
- Let me out! Meow, meow, meow.
- No, no way.

03:18.308 --> 03:19.905
I hate you, Johnny.

03:20.353 --> 03:23.288
I know you don't mean that, Philly.
Go to bed.

03:23.389 --> 03:25.813
Come on, guys.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

03:25.848 --> 03:28.600

- God! Frickin' Johnny.

03:31.187 --> 03:32.854

Oh, heh, okay.

03:42.804 --> 03:44.070
Where the fuck are these guys?

03:44.105 --> 03:45.416
Did you tell 'em the fuckin' time?

03:45.440 --> 03:47.296
I told them 9:00 at
the good Pier One!

03:47.308 --> 03:48.674
We're at the good Pier One!

03:48.897 --> 03:50.409
- (creepy laughter)
- Oh!

03:50.445 --> 03:53.512

- Shh. Shut up, shut up.

03:55.283 --> 03:59.084
Cats and cats, please, welcome
to the neutral territory,

03:59.119 --> 04:01.686
Alabaster!

04:03.123 --> 04:04.689
(sinister chuckle)

04:04.725 --> 04:05.944
Ah.

04:06.727 --> 04:08.077
(humming)

04:09.070 --> 04:11.971
- What the fuck is wrong with this guy?
- Very strange guy.

04:11.999 --> 04:13.431
Ha ha ha, yeah.

04:13.467 --> 04:16.233
He's like Fred Astaire with those moves.
It's hard to look away.

04:16.269 --> 04:17.341
Mike, shut up.

04:17.366 --> 04:19.536
He's a good dancer, what do
you want me to say? Geez.

04:19.572 --> 04:21.704
Johnny's crew. (sinister chuckle)

04:21.741 --> 04:23.674
What an ugly clowder you are.

04:23.709 --> 04:24.775

04:24.810 --> 04:27.745
You guys are ugly!
You guys look like shit.

04:27.780 --> 04:30.014
- Thank you, Chuckles. That'll do.
- You're welcome.

04:30.056 --> 04:33.857
Listen, Alabaster. What the fuck
are you doing in Little Italy?

04:33.893 --> 04:35.959
You stay in your fucking
hood, we'll stay in ours.

04:35.988 --> 04:37.498
You don't see us
pawing around Kip's Bay.

04:37.522 --> 04:40.357
Hmm, times are
a-changing, Johnny Boy.

04:40.392 --> 04:43.193
- Alabaster's crew is goin' big time.
- (cackles)

04:43.228 --> 04:45.628
You think you're the first
guy who came in here

04:45.663 --> 04:47.563
and said something like,
"Things are changing."

04:47.599 --> 04:50.143
Hey, Mike, he thinks it's really
the first time I ever heard that.

04:50.167 --> 04:53.468
This guy's crazy if he... Yeah, he
should probably stick to dancing

04:53.504 --> 04:54.739
'cause he's really good at that.

04:54.763 --> 04:57.050
- Okay, Mike, shut up.
- Like, you're actually very talented.

04:57.074 --> 04:59.041
And it's really good...
It's an honor to watch.

04:59.076 --> 05:01.610
We took Stuyvesant Town just last week.

05:01.645 --> 05:03.545
- Didn't we?
- (chuckles) Yeah.

05:03.580 --> 05:05.281
You're talking shit.

05:05.316 --> 05:06.648
Am I, Jonathan?

05:06.683 --> 05:10.451
How else did I get Stuyvesant
Tony's tooth then?

05:10.486 --> 05:13.087
Hmm? Did I buy it
at the gift shop?

05:13.123 --> 05:14.889
- Hey... Oh!
- I ask you that.

05:14.925 --> 05:17.292
You better back the fuck up, Alabaster.

05:17.327 --> 05:19.264
- Or else.
- Or else, what, boy?

05:19.298 --> 05:20.231
(glass rattles)

05:20.256 --> 05:21.829
- Oh!
- The fuck was that?

05:21.864 --> 05:23.201

05:23.225 --> 05:24.225

05:24.242 --> 05:25.208

05:25.243 --> 05:26.442
What was that, seriously?

05:26.478 --> 05:28.145
Chuckles, please go check on that.

05:28.180 --> 05:30.364
Thank you. See, I just
want to make sure

05:30.389 --> 05:32.099
it's not a threat of
any kind, you know.

05:32.225 --> 05:33.225

05:36.249 --> 05:37.732
How long did it take
you guys to get here?

05:37.756 --> 05:39.333
- Mike, shut the fuck up.
- Sorry, Johnny.

05:39.357 --> 05:40.490

05:41.171 --> 05:42.835
Oh, it's just a bottle, man.

Everybody, it was a bottle!

05:44.867 --> 05:46.397
Must have been the wind.

05:46.562 --> 05:50.164
Listen, Alabaster, you stay
the fuck outta Mulberry Street.

05:50.200 --> 05:54.311
Now, Jonathan, I'm offering
you an olive branch.

I mean, you got a point.

08:33.861 --> 08:34.961
(sobs loudly)

08:34.996 --> 08:37.096
Okay, all right, come on. Come on!

08:37.131 --> 08:38.398
(sobbing)

08:38.433 --> 08:40.633
- Mikey.
- Don't fucking look at me!

08:40.668 --> 08:42.601
- Fuckin' turn around!
- Come on.

08:42.636 --> 08:43.936
Turn around.

08:43.961 --> 08:45.069
Okay.

08:45.573 --> 08:46.573
(soft crying)

08:47.475 --> 08:50.030
Oh, Johnny, no.

08:50.311 --> 08:52.710
What am I gonna do now?

08:54.581 --> 08:55.780
That was fun.

08:56.883 --> 08:58.216
(inhales deeply)

08:58.252 --> 09:00.885
Oh, Johnny, I miss you.

09:03.541 --> 09:04.725
Huh?

09:05.014 --> 09:06.680
For Philly.

09:11.342 --> 09:14.010
Oh, Johnny. Huh?

09:17.370 --> 09:18.702
- Whoa.
- (blade clicks)

09:18.737 --> 09:20.204
(gasps) Whoa.

09:20.239 --> 09:21.372
Whoa.

09:21.414 --> 09:23.546
Big Pussy: We need to retaliate!

09:23.575 --> 09:25.775
Tonight! Not fucking tomorrow!

09:25.810 --> 09:27.877
Not next year! Right fucking now.

09:27.912 --> 09:30.746
Big Puss, if we retaliate,
everything goes out the window.

09:30.782 --> 09:32.215
Everything Johnny worked for.

09:32.250 --> 09:34.484
Blood for blood just means more blood.

09:34.519 --> 09:37.653
New York's not some concrete jungle
where dreams are made of, okay?

09:37.689 --> 09:39.588
Aw, come on! You kitten me?

09:39.623 --> 09:42.157
New York is a jungle,
and we're animals.

09:42.193 --> 09:43.437
Hey, I'm not kitten you, all right?

09:43.461 --> 09:44.504
I'm talkin' serious business,

09:44.528 --> 09:46.195
and you're not takin' it seriously!

09:46.230 --> 09:48.007
Philly:
Let me do the hit.

09:48.532 --> 09:49.663
(laughter)

09:50.534 --> 09:52.901
Look at this fuckin' kid here,
you're a fucking comedian.

09:52.936 --> 09:55.022
Who we got here? Whoopi Bol-gerg?

09:55.272 --> 09:58.139
Whoopi Gol-gerg? Whoopi Bol-gerg?

09:58.174 --> 09:59.475
Whoopi Bol...

09:59.709 --> 10:01.842
Who we got here? Whoopi Ber-gold?

10:01.878 --> 10:03.299
- What's her name?
- Whoopi Goldberg.

10:03.323 --> 10:04.222
- Whoopi what?
- Goldberg.

10:04.247 --> 10:06.747
Goldberg. Who we got here?
Whoopi Goldberg?

10:06.782 --> 10:08.949
They won't expects it comin' from me.

10:08.985 --> 10:11.219
I'll go in there and I'll
pick 'em off one by one,

10:11.254 --> 10:12.804
I swear to frickin' God.

10:13.122 --> 10:14.287
For Johnny.

10:14.468 --> 10:16.556
Listen, Philly, why don't
you go back to bed, okay?

10:16.591 --> 10:18.558
Why don't you go back
to bed, you big sklagoon?

10:18.593 --> 10:19.759
Oh! The mouth!

10:19.794 --> 10:21.906
Who are you to talk to me
like that, you frickin' gabagoo?

10:21.930 --> 10:24.764
Oh! Where'd you
learn these vile words?

10:24.799 --> 10:26.299
I saw it in a MAD Magazine.

10:26.335 --> 10:28.038
- Philly.
- What, Mike?

10:28.393 --> 10:30.702
Don't do this to me, Mikey.
He was my brother.

10:30.738 --> 10:33.439
He's the last thing I fuckin'
had in this whole world.

10:33.474 --> 10:35.307
I get it. We all loved Johnny.

10:35.343 --> 10:36.453
He was a brother to all of us.

10:36.477 --> 10:38.810
Yeah, but he was my brother, Mikey!

10:38.846 --> 10:40.146
That's the difference!

10:40.181 --> 10:41.313
(crying)

10:41.349 --> 10:42.981
You're not one of us, okay?

10:43.017 --> 10:44.616
You don't belong
in the streets, Philly.

10:44.652 --> 10:47.618
I've been hearing that frickin'
speech my whole life, Mikey!

10:47.654 --> 10:49.220
And you know what, it changed tonight!

10:49.256 --> 10:52.357
Get off of me! Get...
Get the Frick off of me!

10:52.392 --> 10:53.591
Come back! Somebody grab him.

10:53.626 --> 10:54.737
- Phil!
- Philly, get back here!

10:54.761 --> 10:57.262
Come back. I was just
fuckin' around, huh? Come on!

10:57.297 --> 11:00.565
I was just fuckin' around
with the kid, I feel bad now.

11:00.600 --> 11:02.133
Whoopi. I like Whoopi.

11:05.904 --> 11:07.404
Alabaster!

11:08.374 --> 11:10.140
Alabaster, come out here.

11:10.176 --> 11:12.443
- (cackling) Wee.
- Who's there?

11:12.478 --> 11:14.778
- Who is that?
- (cackling)

11:14.813 --> 11:15.879
Chuckles.

11:15.914 --> 11:17.714
Oh, hey, little man.

11:17.749 --> 11:19.083
- Look at you.
- Get off me.

11:19.118 --> 11:20.284
Get your paws off me, mister.

11:20.319 --> 11:22.185
You got some spunk, man.

11:22.220 --> 11:23.397
I'm just gonna keep walking, all right?

11:23.421 --> 11:25.632
- No, no, no, no, hold on, man.
- I don't want any trouble?

11:25.656 --> 11:27.068
Let me at least tell you a little joke.

11:27.092 --> 11:29.058
- What?
- Trust me, it's a good joke.

11:29.102 --> 11:30.701
(snickers) I got a ton of 'em,

11:30.728 --> 11:32.528
but this one's special.

11:32.564 --> 11:33.629
What do you call...

11:33.664 --> 11:35.631
Back up from me, mister,
I don't want any trouble.

11:35.666 --> 11:37.633
Hold on, what do you call a cat...

11:37.668 --> 11:38.900
(chuckles)

11:38.935 --> 11:40.768
What do you call a cat...

11:40.804 --> 11:42.850
covered in red?

11:43.039 --> 11:44.233
(grunts)

11:44.783 --> 11:45.783
(gasping)

11:46.376 --> 11:48.643
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11:48.678 --> 11:49.911
Oh, fuck.

11:49.946 --> 11:51.810
You stepped on my punchline.

11:51.835 --> 11:54.630
- Oh, oh, I didn't...
- You didn't let me finish... the joke.

11:54.655 --> 11:56.703
'Cause I thought you were gonna
fucking kill me or something.

11:56.727 --> 11:57.780
Eddie Meow-phy.

11:58.030 --> 11:58.851
What are you... what?

11:58.876 --> 12:00.454
What do you call a cat covered in red?

12:00.490 --> 12:03.677
Eddie Meow-phy, like
his outfit in <i> Delirious.</i>

12:03.702 --> 12:05.692
Oh, see, I don't even get that.

12:05.728 --> 12:07.060
That's like, that's too old.

12:07.096 --> 12:08.496
- Oh, fuck me.
- I've never seen it.

12:08.531 --> 12:09.412
I don't really...

12:09.437 --> 12:11.898
It's irony, because I'm
covered in blood now.

12:11.934 --> 12:14.867
I'm more red than
fucking Eddie Meow-phy.

12:14.902 --> 12:16.503
- That is funny.
- Do me a favor.

12:16.538 --> 12:18.082
I don't have much time,
I'm getting the light.

12:18.106 --> 12:19.717
- I'm literally getting the light.
- Okay, right.

12:19.741 --> 12:21.874
I need you to tell
something to Alabaster.

12:21.909 --> 12:23.276
- Okay.
- (sighs)

12:23.311 --> 12:25.077
If you see him, you say,

12:25.366 --> 12:26.498
"It's been real."

12:26.714 --> 12:27.714
Okay, sure.

12:27.952 --> 12:29.633
- No, wait, don't say "It's been real."
- Okay.

12:29.657 --> 12:31.328
- He'll go like...
- That's too silly, yeah.

12:31.352 --> 12:32.384
It's too stupid.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.780
- Just say, um, uh... "That was fun."
- All right.

12:35.389 --> 12:36.264
Fuck, man.

12:36.335 --> 12:38.077
Do you want me to snap
your neck or something?

12:38.101 --> 12:39.874
- Yeah, let's just finish this.
- All right.

12:40.994 --> 12:42.694
Wow. That felt good.

12:42.822 --> 12:43.873
(panting)

12:44.031 --> 12:45.096
- There he is!
- Oh.

12:45.132 --> 12:46.930
- Oh, I'm gettin' fuckin' old here.
- Philly!

12:46.966 --> 12:48.899
Jesus Christ, Philly,
you had us worried sick.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.934
This is enemy territory. You crazy?

12:50.970 --> 12:52.170
You could get hurt.

12:53.102 --> 12:54.194
Oh my God.

12:54.359 --> 12:55.825
Someone killed Chuckles.

12:55.914 --> 12:57.350
I killed Chuckles.

12:58.110 --> 13:00.382
- What'd you say?
- He whacked Chuckles.

13:00.613 --> 13:03.113
We need to expand
outside of Little Italy.

13:03.257 --> 13:04.881
- What?
- You heard me.

13:04.916 --> 13:07.150
If Alabaster's crew
is expanding their territories,

13:07.186 --> 13:08.885
then we need to do it too, all right?

13:09.210 --> 13:11.054
NoLitas run sloppy, we'll start there.

13:11.089 --> 13:12.755
We'll skimp from their garbage cans,

13:12.791 --> 13:15.102
half a block per week, and then
double it after six months.

13:15.126 --> 13:16.311
Am I understood?

13:16.687 --> 13:17.936
Am I understood?

13:18.197 --> 13:20.796
Yeah. Yeah, that
makes sense, Philly.

13:21.007 --> 13:23.186
It's time for Johnny's crew to grow up.

13:23.788 --> 13:25.343
Let's get the fuck outta here.

13:25.803 --> 13:27.725
All right, you heard the kid.
Come on, let's go.

13:28.172 --> 13:29.258
Let's go home.

13:29.940 --> 13:30.953
♪ ♪

13:33.704 --> 13:34.883
(owls hooting)

13:37.758 --> 13:38.883
(hoots)

13:39.489 --> 13:40.421
Oh!

13:40.446 --> 13:42.417
- Oh my God, there's Maria.
- There she is.

13:42.452 --> 13:44.485
- What is it, ten minutes?
- I know, it's insane.

13:44.521 --> 13:45.853
Hoo, guys!

13:45.888 --> 13:47.455
- Sorry, Monty.
- Oh, Maria!

13:47.490 --> 13:49.757
- Maria, hi.
- Hey, Danielle.

13:49.792 --> 13:51.593
So sorry I'm late again.

13:51.628 --> 13:53.206
It's just, sorta, become a thing for me.

13:53.230 --> 13:54.394
It has become a thing.

13:54.430 --> 13:56.408
Yeah, just show up on time,
and then, that's gonna...

13:56.432 --> 13:57.598
No, absolutely, and... and...

13:57.633 --> 13:58.865
It's Christmas time!

13:58.900 --> 14:00.212
- Let's go inside, okay?
- Ah! I'm so excited.

14:00.236 --> 14:02.086
I want you to see my new
place, it's gorgeous.

14:02.111 --> 14:03.069
I'm dying!

14:03.105 --> 14:04.504
Okay, what do you guys think?

14:04.540 --> 14:06.172
- Ooh!
- It's beautiful.

14:06.208 --> 14:07.785
Basically you guys know,
like, I've been very

14:07.809 --> 14:09.718
mid-century modern for,
like, the past few years.

14:09.742 --> 14:11.726
I'm asleep at the wheel
just talking about it, honestly.

14:11.750 --> 14:14.124
Thank you. I mean, it's so shoved
down our throats with <i> Mad Men,</i>

14:14.148 --> 14:16.315
- and, obviously, more famously <i> Pan Am.</i>
- Oh, yes.

14:16.351 --> 14:17.661
- You know, so...
- Yeah, of course.

14:17.685 --> 14:18.762
Okay, let's open presents, guys.

14:18.786 --> 14:20.786
- Okay, I'll go first, I'll go first.
- Oh my God.

14:20.821 --> 14:22.154
Um, Monty...

14:22.189 --> 14:23.956
- What?!
- I am your Secret Santa.

14:23.991 --> 14:25.157
Again?

14:25.192 --> 14:26.659
I know, I know, it's so funny.

14:26.694 --> 14:28.160
I feel like you always manage it.

14:28.195 --> 14:30.161
- It's pure chance!
- There's gonna be repeats.

14:30.196 --> 14:32.096
It's just probability, but, um, anyway.

14:32.132 --> 14:33.943
Well, I'll just say "Merry
Christmas, old friend,"

14:33.967 --> 14:35.867
- and here you go.
- Oh.

14:36.403 --> 14:38.470
Oh, my God!

14:38.505 --> 14:39.671
- It's a Nano!
- Wow, yeah.

14:39.706 --> 14:42.206
- Wow, is that a... an iPod Nano?
- It's an iPod Nano, yeah.

14:42.242 --> 14:43.453
- It's an iPod Nano, yeah.
- Yeah.

14:43.477 --> 14:46.117
That's a really, um... Is it used?

14:46.149 --> 14:47.038
Actually, it's not.

14:47.063 --> 14:48.423
No, this is new, it's
still in the plastic.

14:48.447 --> 14:49.858
As you know, I had
a promotion this year,

14:49.882 --> 14:51.582
another one, which has been huge,

14:51.594 --> 14:53.514
and so, I thought, why not splurge.

14:53.539 --> 14:55.997
I could think of a reason. It's
called a limit. A five dollar limit.

14:56.021 --> 14:57.621
(gasps) Oh my God,
it comes with a strap!

14:57.657 --> 14:58.922
I bought the strap separately.

14:58.957 --> 15:01.725
I also got it etched
if you turn it over.

15:01.761 --> 15:03.660
- No!
- Yes, yes.

15:03.695 --> 15:05.227
Oh! You know me so well.

15:05.263 --> 15:06.674
- I love you, thank you. Mwa!
- Yeah.

15:06.698 --> 15:08.364
- Fly on.
- Fly on. Um, all right.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.466
- I will go next.
- Drum roll.

15:10.502 --> 15:12.669
- Okay.
- Who's it gonna be? Let's see.

15:12.704 --> 15:15.461
My Secret Santa was...

15:15.774 --> 15:18.841
(gasps) Oh my gosh! Monty, I'm yours?

15:18.876 --> 15:21.570
- Wait a minute. Hold up.
- Yeah?

15:21.883 --> 15:23.623
- That wrapping is insane, Monty!
- Okay, shut up!

15:23.647 --> 15:25.535
I did not want to call
attention to it, but thank you.

15:25.559 --> 15:26.826
- It is really beautiful.
- Thank you!

15:26.850 --> 15:29.584
It's made out of
old dress patterns, yeah.

15:29.620 --> 15:31.420
I don't want her to open it!

15:31.455 --> 15:32.532
- I don't want her to open it.
- I know.

15:32.556 --> 15:34.489
I don't want to tear it.
It's too nice to tear.

15:34.525 --> 15:36.424
We should really be careful to, kind of,

15:36.459 --> 15:38.058
let... let the tape lift up naturally.

15:38.093 --> 15:39.905
- You know what you should do?
- Steam it, steam it open.

15:39.929 --> 15:41.507
Maria, go ahead and
make a double boiler.

15:41.531 --> 15:42.491
Okay, I'm on it.

15:42.516 --> 15:43.776
Maria, okay, so just take a bigger pot,

15:43.800 --> 15:45.136
fill it with water, and then take a

15:45.148 --> 15:46.612
smaller, like even literally, a pan.

15:46.636 --> 15:48.602
Put that on top of the pot,
so it's gonna boil.

15:48.638 --> 15:50.115
The steam's gonna
come up through the top pan.

15:50.139 --> 15:52.606
- Literally, hold the present over.
- And it'll...

15:52.642 --> 15:53.973
That's gonna release the tape.

If you don't do that, the tape is
gonna rip off the vintage Vogue.

15:59.113 --> 16:00.279
If you steam it open,

16:00.315 --> 16:02.265
you can preserve the
austerity of the package.

16:02.290 --> 16:03.053
Exactly.

Okay, okay, thank you

Okay, let's open it up.
Here we go.

16:07.656 --> 16:09.188
- Oh!

16:09.224 --> 16:10.356
- You got me pants.
- Oh, oh!

16:10.391 --> 16:11.623
- I know.
- I'm jealous!

16:11.659 --> 16:13.892
There, I said it!
I'm sorry, I had to be honest.

16:13.927 --> 16:16.108
- Do not be jealous.
- I'm jealous, I'm jealous.

16:16.133 --> 16:18.555

funny, there's, um...

16:18.688 --> 16:20.666
The price tag's right on there.

16:20.711 --> 16:22.878

- Uh-oh, let me see, let me see.

16:22.903 --> 16:23.819
Oh, no, no, you guys, no!

16:23.844 --> 16:25.014

- It's fine.

16:25.038 --> 16:25.764
Oh my God.

16:25.789 --> 16:27.283
I told them at the store,
I said, "Take that off!"

16:27.307 --> 16:28.751
Well, that's how much good things cost.

16:28.775 --> 16:30.501
- She should try them on, right?
- Oh my God!

16:30.525 --> 16:31.554
- Try them on.
- Try them on.

16:31.578 --> 16:33.611
- I don't know, guys.
- Try on the pants!

16:33.646 --> 16:35.057
- Try on the pants.
- Try on the pants.

16:35.081 --> 16:36.325

- Try on the pants!

- Do they?

16:42.922 --> 16:44.053
I think this is you.

16:44.078 --> 16:46.122
Terrified to present my gift, because...

16:46.157 --> 16:47.924
- Don't be scared, come on!
- Oh, please!

16:47.959 --> 16:49.971
- Are you kidding me?
- You know I... You could give me a can

16:49.995 --> 16:52.396
with a hammer inside of it,
and I would be pleased.

16:52.431 --> 16:54.364
Well, hammers aren't cheap, you know.

16:54.400 --> 16:55.509
Uh, that would still be too much,

16:55.521 --> 16:56.811
really, if we're going by the rules.

16:56.835 --> 16:59.035
- Okay, well.
- Anyway, I won't preface it too much.

16:59.352 --> 17:00.570
It's kind of only half-wrapped.

17:00.594 --> 17:02.371
- Just tear on through.
- Okay, here I go.

17:02.407 --> 17:04.141
Ripping through, what's it gonna be?

17:05.006 --> 17:06.398
Oh.

what I'm looking at.

17:10.094 --> 17:12.233

up for me, I'm looking at it.

17:12.258 --> 17:13.816

- A little bit of both, yeah.

17:21.444 --> 17:23.458
Bone for the... the strong strokes.

17:23.492 --> 17:24.826
Um, well, thank you.

17:24.861 --> 17:26.493

17:26.530 --> 17:28.029
Hey, smile.

17:28.064 --> 17:29.196
I'm smiling.

17:29.232 --> 17:30.732
Sorry, I'm sorry, Maria, thank you.

17:30.913 --> 17:32.686
I can see that you put a lot of effort

17:32.720 --> 17:34.375
into this, and it's a story piece.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.036
I don't even love it anymore, okay?

17:36.071 --> 17:37.749
- I realize it's garbage.
- Well, I love it, Maria.

17:37.773 --> 17:39.017
- It's garbage.
- I love it, Maria.

23:23.966 --> 23:26.532
If we take Two Bridges,
that means the Brooklyn connect.

23:26.568 --> 23:28.701
All of the boroughs
are ours after that.

23:28.737 --> 23:30.251
All right, you gonna
make me say his name?

23:30.275 --> 23:32.814
Two Bridges is Alabaster's
territory, all right?

23:32.947 --> 23:34.451
And going against him?
I don't know what

23:34.475 --> 23:36.955
that would accomplish
other than an all-out war.

23:37.378 --> 23:38.479
Hmm.

23:38.754 --> 23:40.486
Okey-doke, Michael.

23:40.648 --> 23:42.081
Thank you for that.

23:42.116 --> 23:44.984
Okay, that's good. And see,
that's talking it out.

23:45.019 --> 23:46.446
That comes from talking it out.

23:46.471 --> 23:49.455
I think I'm all good for today,
so you're excused.

23:49.547 --> 23:50.588
Thank you.

23:51.124 --> 23:52.885
Hmm, that's a little...

23:53.112 --> 23:54.811
That's more quiet than usual.

23:55.197 --> 23:56.823
It's just, like, I
feel like we usually,

23:56.848 --> 23:58.529
you know, laugh when I
leave or something.

23:58.564 --> 24:00.598
Say jokes, something like that.

24:00.633 --> 24:02.200
Right? Philly?

24:02.338 --> 24:04.869
Mikey, I said you
was excused, all right?

24:04.905 --> 24:07.204
I wasn't asking, I was telling.
It was an order.

24:07.239 --> 24:08.471
Thank you so much.

24:09.163 --> 24:10.494
All right.

24:12.497 --> 24:13.689
Yes, boss.

24:14.246 --> 24:15.455
♪ ♪

24:27.682 --> 24:29.569
That feels really...
Oh, right there, right there.

24:29.593 --> 24:31.127
Right there? That feel good?

24:31.162 --> 24:33.095
- Very nice.
- Oh, you're so tense.

24:33.131 --> 24:34.797
Now, go easy right
there, that's kinda...

24:34.833 --> 24:36.125
There's a kinda knot.

24:36.150 --> 24:37.978
- Let me untie that for you.
- Well, why don't...

24:38.002 --> 24:39.168
Why don't you avoid it?

24:39.204 --> 24:40.902
- Why don't you go around the knot?
- Okay.

24:40.938 --> 24:42.726
That's not how it works.
You don't tell a

24:42.751 --> 24:44.472
hairdresser how to cut
your hair, right?

24:44.507 --> 24:48.619
Well, I do. I do tell the
hairdresser how to cut my hair.

24:48.908 --> 24:50.411
If I had any.

24:50.447 --> 24:51.847
Hey, that's true, that's true.

24:51.882 --> 24:54.182
- That's bad.
- I have a sense of humor about myself.

24:54.218 --> 24:56.211
I don't take myself
too seriously at all.

24:56.236 --> 24:58.085
That's the way to live,
that's the way to live.

24:58.120 --> 24:59.784
When you gonna get up
and run away with me?

24:59.808 --> 25:00.868
Stop it, you!

25:00.893 --> 25:02.990
You know I can't.
I'm finishing school, I can't.

25:03.025 --> 25:05.301
I know, I know. Finish
up the massage, please?

25:05.326 --> 25:06.060
Oh, yes, sir.

25:06.095 --> 25:07.505
Father Anthony (clears
throat): Pardon me?

25:07.529 --> 25:09.029
Should I stay or should I go?

25:09.065 --> 25:10.331
Ah, you're still here.

25:10.366 --> 25:12.566
You know, you don't have
to do the voice with us.

25:12.601 --> 25:15.668
(clears throat, coughs)
God, thank God. Thank you.

25:15.703 --> 25:18.804
You really get lost
in the role, Gigglepuss.

25:18.840 --> 25:20.806
- It's transformative.
- Oh, I been doing this...

25:20.842 --> 25:23.797
This is in my bag of tricks. Uh,
you know, my trunk of characters.

25:23.822 --> 25:25.622
Oh, Father Anthony was
one of your characters?

25:25.646 --> 25:27.380
He was my in one-man show.

25:27.415 --> 25:29.315
Yeah, I been doing him
for a while, but, um...

25:29.351 --> 25:30.674
Well, any shows you got comin' up, I'd

25:30.686 --> 25:32.162
love to hear about it.
You just tell me.

25:32.186 --> 25:34.987
Well, my one-man show
closes on Friday, and I...

25:35.022 --> 25:37.089
- I cannot make it this Friday.
- No problem.

25:37.124 --> 25:38.634
- Weekdays are hard for me.
- No big whoop.

25:38.658 --> 25:39.958
- Weekends, too.
- No big whoop.

25:39.994 --> 25:42.895
Is Johnny's crew or Phil's crew
or whatever they're called now,

25:42.930 --> 25:45.063
are they gonna fall
for the Two Bridges trap?

25:45.099 --> 25:47.032
Yeah, I believe so,
I think... (chuckles)

25:47.067 --> 25:48.700
hook, line and sinker, as they say.

25:48.735 --> 25:50.712
Phil seemed pretty enticed
at the notion, you know.

25:50.736 --> 25:52.064
(both snickering)

25:52.906 --> 25:55.084
Um... (clears throat) Yeah, I
wanted to ask you something,

25:55.108 --> 25:56.941
uh, Alabaster, uh... (clears throat)

25:56.976 --> 25:58.020
I want to do the hit on Phil.

25:58.044 --> 26:00.177
'Cause, uh, because
he killed my brother, Chuckles.

26:00.213 --> 26:01.723
You know, he killed
my brother, Chuckles,

26:01.747 --> 26:03.064
and I wanna do the hit on him.

26:03.716 --> 26:05.049
Dear, Gigglepuss.

26:05.084 --> 26:06.749
Chuckles was a brother to all of us.

26:06.785 --> 26:08.096
Yeah, I know, may he rest in peace.

26:08.120 --> 26:11.054
You'll get your blood in due time.

26:11.089 --> 26:12.889
In doodoo time.

26:12.925 --> 26:14.049
(snickering)

26:17.429 --> 26:18.705
