PRINT ON THE RAILING.

05:39.090 --> 05:42.590

A POTENTIAL HOMICIDE SCENE.

A STRUGGLE.

[HOOD] THERE IS A BULLET HOLE.
GOOD LUCK FINDING THE GUN.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.230

CLEAN UP SOMETHING.

05:56.270 --> 05:57.650
WHO OWNS THE PLACE?

05:57.690 --> 05:59.730
[LESLIE] THE MAIL SAYS "ALCOCK".

05:59.770 --> 06:03.400

08:02.270 --> 08:04.560
[JAKE] OH YEAH THE BLOCKAGE
IN YOUR HEART IS MY FAULT.

08:04.610 --> 08:05.690

THE SEVEN TRAYS OF PORK CHOPS

EXACTLY AND CHRISTIAN HE--
HE DOESN'T REMEMBER.

08:47.570 --> 08:49.730
[MALACHY] WHAT DO YOU MEAN
HE DOESN'T REMEMBER?
IT'S THE DRUGS ISN'T IT?

08:49.780 --> 08:51.990
[JAKE] DAD, NO, LOOK IT IS NOT
THE DRUGS, OKAY?

08:52.030 --> 08:55.030
JUST RELAX.
I'M HANDLING IT.

08:55.070 --> 08:57.700
[MALACHY] I REALLY THOUGHT
HE WAS MAKING AN EFFORT.

08:58.620 --> 09:01.540
[JAKE] LOOK, PLEASE--
JUST-- YOU KNOW--

09:01.580 --> 09:03.540
TAKE A FEW MORE ZIPS OF
YOUR JUICE BOX

09:03.580 --> 09:05.710
AND FOCUS ON NOT HAVING
ANOTHER HEART ATTACK.

09:05.750 --> 09:06.330
YOU GOT ME?

09:06.380 --> 09:07.290
I AM ON IT.

09:07.340 --> 09:08.210
ALRIGHT.

09:08.250 --> 09:09.590
[MALACHY] YEAH.
[JAKE] YOU...

09:09.630 --> 09:11.010
[ROSE] ME?

09:16.760 --> 09:18.600

09:18.640 --> 09:20.260
FIND OUT THE REAL STORY.

09:20.310 --> 09:21.100
[ROSE] OH, I WILL.

09:21.140 --> 09:22.680
I WILL.

09:22.730 --> 09:24.440
DON'T YOU WORRY, OKAY?

09:24.730 --> 09:27.770
&lt;♪♪&gt;

09:27.810 --> 09:30.110
[SHANNIE] BERNIE PLAYS THE SAME
NUMBERS EVERY WEEK.

09:30.150 --> 09:32.570
FOR THE LAST 16 YEARS HE'S
PLAYED THE SAME STUPID NUMBERS:

09:32.610 --> 09:35.660
22, 25, 10, 19, 18, 31.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.740
THEN LAST WEEK, THERE WAS A DRAW
FOR 1.2 MILLION DOLLARS

09:37.780 --> 09:39.280
AND BERNIE'S NUMBERS CAME UP.

09:39.330 --> 09:41.290
AND THE LOTTO COMMISSION
CONFIRMED THERE WAS

09:41.330 --> 09:44.620
A WINNING TICKET IN ST. JOHN'S,
I KNOW HE WON.

09:44.660 --> 09:46.370
ARE YOU PAYING ATTENTION TO ME?

09:46.420 --> 09:48.330
[DES] OF COURSE I AM
MRS. "MALONEY".

09:48.380 --> 09:52.630
[SHANNIE] IT'S "MELONE".
[DES] RIGHT. MRS. MALONE.

09:52.670 --> 09:55.090
I HAVE JUST ONE QUESTION.

09:55.130 --> 09:58.300
IF YOUR HUSBAND WON
THE LOTTERY--

09:58.340 --> 10:04.180
ALLEGEDLY WON THE LOTTERY,
WHY WOULDN'T HE CASH IT IN?

10:04.230 --> 10:05.770
[SHANNIE] BECAUSE, IF YOU HAD
BEEN LISTENING, MY HUSBAND

10:05.810 --> 10:08.600
AND I ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF
DIVORCE PROCEEDINGS.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.230
[DES] THAT'S TERRIBLE,
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

10:10.270 --> 10:11.520
[SHANNIE] DON'T BE.
[DES] VERY WELL.

10:11.570 --> 10:13.190
[SHANNIE] IF HE KEEPS THAT
TICKET SECRET AND FINDS A WAY

10:13.230 --> 10:15.240
TO CLAIM IT AFTER OUR DIVORCE
IS FINALIZED, HE WON'T BE

10:15.280 --> 10:17.490
OBLIGATED TO GIVE ME HALF THE
WINNINGS.

10:17.530 --> 10:19.280
[DES] DIABOLICAL.
[TINNY] HEY.

10:19.320 --> 10:21.030
[DES] HEY-- A PA PA PA PA.

10:21.080 --> 10:22.790
IS YOUR HUSBAND A HOCKEY FAN,
MRS. MALONE?

12:48.600 --> 12:50.350
[LESLIE] I TRACKED DOWN
THE OWNERS OF THE HOUSE.

12:50.390 --> 12:52.810
THEY'RE DOWN IN BOSTON,
THEY RENT THIS PLACE
OUT TO TOURISTS.

12:52.850 --> 12:54.060
[HOOD] WHO WAS RENTING IT
LAST NIGHT?

12:54.100 --> 12:56.610
[LESLIE] LAST COUPLE WEEKS

12:57.610 --> 12:58.320
[HOOD] TW GROUP.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.280
WE DON'T HAVE A NAME?

13:00.320 --> 13:02.360

ANYTHING ON HIM?

13:09.910 --> 13:12.580

13:21.420 --> 13:22.800
BUT SERGEANT,

13:22.840 --> 13:25.890
IT'S OBVIOUS THE BRASS WANTS
TO SEE YOUR STAR KEEP RISING.

13:25.930 --> 13:29.930
I WOULD HATE TO SEE
A SILLY LITTLE CONFLICT OF
INTEREST TANGLE YOU UP.

[LESLIE] THAT'S
A LOVELY SENTIMENT

13:50.660 --> 13:52.450

YOU CAN KEEP ASKING
OVER AND OVER,

16:27.610 --> 16:30.400
IT'S NOT GONNA HELP ME REMEMBER.

16:30.440 --> 16:31.940

[LESLIE] WOULD YOU AGREE TO
SUBMIT YOURSELF TO A TOX SCREEN?

17:43.680 --> 17:47.810
THEY ALSO FOUND HIGH
LEVELS OF COCAINE AND
PERCOCET IN HIS SYSTEM.

17:47.860 --> 17:50.020
SOMETIMES NO NEWS,

17:50.070 --> 17:52.860
[JAKE] WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT

17:52.900 --> 17:56.280

RESPECTFULLY UNTAKE THE CASE.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.960
[SHANNIE] BECAUSE OF WALLY?
HE'S HARMLESS.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.380
[DES] ASSAULT AND BATTERY,

19:34.420 --> 19:37.010
ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON,
ASSAULT WITH A SWAN?

19:37.050 --> 19:40.260
[SHANNIE] WHAT?
[DES] IT'S A TALL WHITE BIRD.

19:40.300 --> 19:42.340
[SHANNIE] I KNOW WHAT A SWAN
IS. LOOK IF YOU FIND THAT TICKET

19:42.390 --> 19:44.390
I WILL PAY YOU
FIVE PERCENT OF THE JACKPOT.

19:47.140 --> 19:49.020
THAT'S FIVE PERCENT OF
ONE MILLION DOLLARS.

19:49.060 --> 19:52.770
[DES] MY OH MY,
IS LIFE SO CHEAP TO YOU?

19:52.810 --> 19:53.940
[TINNY] HE'LL TAKE IT!

19:53.980 --> 19:56.230
[DES] NO I WON'T!
[TINNY] YES, YOU WILL!

19:56.270 --> 19:58.280
[SHANNIE] GOOD.
I'LL BE IN TOUCH.

20:03.450 --> 20:06.660
[DES] TINNY, I DON'T THINK
500 BUCKS IS WORTH ME
RISKING MY LIFE.

20:06.700 --> 20:07.490
[TINNY] DES...

20:07.540 --> 20:12.120
FIVE PERCENT OF ONE MILLION
IS...

20:12.170 --> 20:13.540
LOOK NEVER MIND.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.210
I'LL HANDLE THAT END OF IT.

20:15.250 --> 20:18.260
&lt;♪♪&gt;

20:20.340 --> 20:22.590
[JAKE] WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:22.630 --> 20:24.760
[MALACHY] I FOUND AN INTERESTING
SITE FOR A BRAND NEW INDEPENDENT
ESCORT BY THE NAME OF "DESTINY".

20:24.800 --> 20:26.970
[ROSE] WHICH WAS CHASTITY'S
ORIGINAL MONIKER.

20:27.010 --> 20:29.140
[MALACHY] AND JUDGING FROM THE
PHOTO, SHE'S NOW A RED HEAD.

20:29.180 --> 20:30.600
[JAKE] I TOLD YOU TO KEEP HIM
OUT OF THIS.

20:30.640 --> 20:33.400
[ROSE] YOU TRY AND STOP HIM.
[JAKE] OKAY, DAD YOU GOTTA

20:33.440 --> 20:35.650
START TAKING THIS HEART ATTACK
THING A LITTLE MORE SERIOUSLY.

20:35.690 --> 20:36.480
[MALACHY] HE'S MY SON.

20:36.520 --> 20:37.480
DROP IT.

20:37.520 --> 20:38.610
[JAKE] I WILL HANDLE THIS.

20:38.650 --> 20:39.320
I'LL LOOK HER UP.

20:39.360 --> 20:40.650
I'LL SEE IF IT'S REALLY HER.

20:40.690 --> 20:42.450
WILL THAT MAKE HER HAPPY?

20:42.490 --> 20:44.740
[ROSE] SOMEBODY ALREADY TOOK
THE LIBERTY. COME ON IN.

20:44.780 --> 20:46.490
[CHASTITY] OH NO.

20:46.530 --> 20:48.450
WHAT'S THIS, A LAST REQUEST?

20:48.490 --> 20:49.580
I DON'T DO THEM NO MORE, OKAY?

20:49.620 --> 20:51.160
IT'S A LIABILITY.

20:51.200 --> 20:53.080
[JAKE] I NEED TO ASK YOU
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS,
THAT'S ALL.

20:53.120 --> 20:56.250
[MALACHY] WHAT HAPPENED
AT THE NEWFOUNDLAND
HOTEL BAR LAST NIGHT?

20:56.290 --> 20:57.840
[CHASTITY] I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU WANT,

20:57.880 --> 21:00.260
I'M STILL GETTING
MY 300 UP FRONT.

21:00.300 --> 21:03.180
[JAKE] HOW MUCH?
[CHASTITY] 300.

21:03.220 --> 21:06.260
[JAKE] FINE. OKAY LOOK,
I'LL PAY YOU YOUR 300,

21:06.300 --> 21:10.310
BUT I GOTTA ASK YOU A COUPLE
QUESTIONS, OUT IN THE HALLWAY.

21:10.350 --> 21:13.350
[MALACHY] YOU HAD A DATE
WITH THIS GUY?

21:13.390 --> 21:15.310
[CHASTITY] ALRIGHT, IT WAS KIND
OF WEIRD.

21:15.350 --> 21:17.940
[MALACHY] EXPLAIN.
[CHASTITY] HE DIDN'T HIRE ME.

21:17.980 --> 21:19.400
SOME OTHER GUY HIRED ME.

21:19.440 --> 21:21.650
HE SAID HE NEEDED SOME HELP
WITH A FANTASY.

21:21.690 --> 21:24.530
[JAKE] WHAT KIND OF FANTASY?
[CHASTITY] THIS MAN, HE SAID,

21:24.570 --> 21:26.740
"I'LL PAY YOU A THOUSAND
DOLLARS IF YOU SLIP MY

21:26.780 --> 21:28.530
BOYFRIEND A RUFY IN THE BAR
AND DRIVE HIM OUT

21:28.580 --> 21:29.950
TO SIGNAL HILL".

21:29.990 --> 21:31.500
SO THAT'S WHAT I DID.

21:31.540 --> 21:33.910
I DRUGGED HIM, DROPPED HIM OFF,
AND BAILED.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.420
[MALACHY] SO WHO'S THIS MAN?
[CHASTITY] I HAVE NO IDEA.

21:36.460 --> 21:37.540
WE SET IT UP ON THE PHONE.

21:37.580 --> 21:39.340
[MALACHY] WAS HE AT THE HOUSE
ON SIGNAL HILL?

21:39.380 --> 21:41.380
[CHASTITY] THERE WAS NOBODY
THERE. BUDDY WAS PASSING OUT,

21:41.420 --> 21:43.590
SO I GAVE HIM A BLANKET AND
LEFT.

21:43.630 --> 21:44.670
[JAKE] HOW SWEET.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.840
THE WHOLE THING DIDN'T SEEM
AT ALL ODD TO YOU?

21:46.890 --> 21:48.850
[CHASTITY] IT'S NOT THE ODDEST
THING I'VE EVER DONE,

21:48.890 --> 21:50.180
THAT'S FOR SURE.

21:50.220 --> 21:51.260
[DES] HELLO.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.560
GOT THE FLOWERS I SENT OVER?

21:53.600 --> 21:55.440
[MALACHY] YES SON, THANK YOU.
[TINNY] HEY POPPY.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.810
[MALACHY] HEY.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.350
[TINNY] YOU DON'T LOOK ANY
WORSE THAN USUAL.

21:59.400 --> 22:02.400
[DES] JAKE, I THINK I'M GONNA
NEED SOME HELP ON THIS CASE.

22:02.440 --> 22:04.490
[JAKE] DES, CAN YOU PLEASE
JUST HANDLE IT? ALRIGHT?

22:04.530 --> 22:05.490
[TINNY] WE GOT IT.

22:05.530 --> 22:07.570
IT'S PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD.

22:07.610 --> 22:09.070
DON'T WORRY.

22:09.110 --> 22:10.990
[DES] WHO ARE YOU? WHO'S--
ARE YOU A COUSIN OR SOMETHING?

22:11.030 --> 22:12.490
[CHASTITY] WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO BE YOUR COUSIN?

22:12.540 --> 22:13.540
[JAKE] OKAY... WELL THANKS.

22:13.580 --> 22:14.790
BYE BYE NOW.

22:14.830 --> 22:17.000
CHEERS.

22:17.040 --> 22:20.040
&lt;♪♪&gt;

22:24.590 --> 22:26.470
[JAKE] THEY RELEASED YA HUH?

22:26.510 --> 22:27.800
[CHRISTIAN] NO BODY, NO CRIME.

22:27.840 --> 22:30.850
[JAKE] WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
ABOUT THE TW GROUP?

22:30.890 --> 22:32.430
[CHRISTIAN] THEY'RE TRYING
TO SET ME UP.

22:32.470 --> 22:33.310
IT'S OBVIOUS.

22:33.350 --> 22:34.640
[JAKE] THEY WERE TRYING
TO SET YOU UP?

22:34.680 --> 22:39.900
[CHRISTIAN] YEAH, I SAW SOME
PAPERS I SHOULDN'T HAVE SEEN.

22:39.940 --> 22:44.780
[JAKE] TELL ME WHAT
THEY'RE UP TO.

22:44.820 --> 22:46.320
[CHRISTIAN] TOMMY WINDSOR IS

22:46.360 --> 22:48.660
THE BERNIE MADOFF
OF NEWFOUNDLAND.

22:48.700 --> 22:50.370
THEY TAKE DOWN PAYMENTS
ON PROPERTIES,

22:50.410 --> 22:52.950
AND THEY REINVEST IN BIGGER AND
BETTER PROPERTIES.

22:52.990 --> 22:56.370
THE WHOLE THING IS
ABOUT TO COLLAPSE.

22:56.410 --> 22:58.540
[JAKE] SO YOU GOT YOURSELF
TANGLED UP IN A PONZI SCHEME.

22:58.580 --> 22:59.960
[CHRISTIAN] COME ON.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.590
AS SOON AS I KNEW
WHAT WAS GOING ON,

23:01.630 --> 23:03.340
I WAS GONNA BLOW THE WHISTLE.

23:03.380 --> 23:05.590
THEY'RE UNDER FEDERAL
INVESTIGATION AND THE AXE IS
ABOUT TO FALL.

23:05.630 --> 23:07.880
THEY'RE TRYING TO CLEAN
UP ALL THE LOOSE ENDS.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.380
THAT INCLUDES ME.

23:09.420 --> 23:11.180
[JAKE] OH, YEAH JUST RELAX.
HAVE YOURSELF A LITTLE NAP.

23:11.220 --> 23:12.550
[CHRISTIAN] YEAH, I'M TIRED.
LEAVE ME ALONE.

23:12.600 --> 23:15.390
[JAKE] HEY!
[CHRISTIAN] WHAT?

23:15.430 --> 23:17.390
[JAKE] YOUR FATHER
IS IN THE HOSPITAL.

23:17.430 --> 23:19.600
I JUST THOUGHT YOU
SHOULD KNOW. GOOD NIGHT.

23:19.640 --> 23:21.440
[CHRISTIAN] HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

23:21.480 --> 23:23.270
[JAKE] WELL HE HAD
A HEART ATTACK

23:23.310 --> 23:26.610
WHEN YOU WERE BUSY
MOPPING UP SOME STRANGER'S BLOOD
UP ON SIGNAL HILL.

23:26.650 --> 23:29.110
[CHRISTIAN] IS HE ALRIGHT?
[JAKE] WHY DON'T YOU GO AND
FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF?

23:29.150 --> 23:31.160
[CHRISTIAN] I CAN'T FACE HIM
RIGHT NOW.

23:32.700 --> 23:34.450
[JAKE] WHATEVER CHRISTIAN.

23:39.040 --> 23:40.920
[DES] IT'S GETTING A LITTLE
LATE FOR CALLERS.

23:40.960 --> 23:42.960
[TINNY] DO YOU WANNA SOLVE
THIS CASE OR NOT?

23:48.470 --> 23:50.010
&lt;KNOCKING SOFTLY&gt;
[DES] WALLY?

23:50.050 --> 23:51.680

24:11.740 --> 24:13.570

WINNING TICKET, DIDN'T HE?

24:23.080 --> 24:24.080
[BERNARD] YEAH.

24:24.130 --> 24:26.500
I WON THE LOTTERY,
FAIR AND SQUARE.

24:26.540 --> 24:29.550
I TRUSTED MY GOOD FRIEND WALLY
TO CASH IT IN FOR A CUT,

24:29.590 --> 24:32.680
SO I WOULDN'T HAVE TO FORK
OVER HALF THE CASH TO THAT

24:32.720 --> 24:34.640
CHEATING BAG OF MAKE-UP.

24:34.680 --> 24:37.640
[DES] YOUR WIFE WAS
CHEATING ON YOU?

24:37.680 --> 24:39.890
[BERNARD] APPARENTLY.

24:39.930 --> 24:42.560
WITH WALLY!

24:42.600 --> 24:44.730
IT'S ALL HERE
IN THE PHONE BILL.

24:44.770 --> 24:45.900
NOT SURE HOW I MISSED THAT ONE.

24:45.940 --> 24:47.900
THEY'RE THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE
I KNOW.

24:47.940 --> 24:51.280
[TINNY] WELL YOUR WIFE PROMISED
US A PERCENTAGE OF THE WINNINGS
IF WE FIND THE TICKET.

24:51.320 --> 24:52.700
[BERNARD] OH YEAH?

24:53.780 --> 24:54.610
I'LL GIVE YOU FIVE PERCENT.

24:54.660 --> 24:56.320
[TINNY] SHE ALREADY PROMISED
US TEN.

24:56.370 --> 24:57.700
[BERNARD] OKAY.

24:57.740 --> 24:59.120
YOU FIND WALLY AND BRING ME
BACK THE WINNING TICKET.

24:59.160 --> 25:01.660
I'LL GIVE YOU TWELVE PERCENT.

25:01.710 --> 25:03.370
[TINNY] DEAL.

25:03.420 --> 25:06.290

NEW BRUNSWICK TO THE LOTTO
COMMISSION TO CASH IT IN.

25:06.330 --> 25:08.710
BUT THE AIRPORT'S FOGGED IN,

25:09.710 --> 25:13.300

I GUESS I JUST--

25:46.790 --> 25:49.790
I GUESS I DIALED

26:22.830 --> 26:25.580
&lt;♪♪&gt;

26:45.890 --> 26:48.650
[HOOD] LETS GET HER OUT OF HERE
AND LOCK DOWN THE SCENE, OKAY?

26:51.360 --> 26:53.820
YOU CLOSED A HOMICIDE BEFORE
THE BODY EVEN SHOWED UP.

26:53.860 --> 26:55.030
THAT SHOWS CLASS.

26:55.070 --> 26:56.820
[LESLIE] LUCY WINDSOR?

26:56.860 --> 27:00.410
[HOOD] LET'S GET THAT
ARREST WARRANT FOR
CHRISTIAN DOYLE ON THE GO.

27:00.450 --> 27:03.450
&lt;♪♪&gt;

27:09.870 --> 27:11.750
[JAKE] PLEASE TELL ME
THAT'S NOT LUCY WINDSOR?

27:11.790 --> 27:14.750
[LESLIE] WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO LIE, DOYLE?

27:14.800 --> 27:16.460
[JAKE] THIS ISN'T GOOD.
[LESLIE] THERE IS A FIRST

27:16.510 --> 27:17.800
DEGREE MURDER WARRANT DOWN
ON YOUR BROTHER.

27:17.840 --> 27:19.800
[JAKE] LOOK I'M PRETTY SURE THAT
CHRISTIAN IS BEING SET UP HERE.

27:19.840 --> 27:22.800
[LESLIE] JAKE, HAVE YOU EVER
CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY

27:22.850 --> 27:26.520
THAT YOUR BROTHER IS
LYING TO YOU?

27:26.560 --> 27:27.850
[JAKE] WHAT IS THAT?

27:27.890 --> 27:29.850
[LESLIE] SHE MUSTA
JUST COME FROM REHAB.

27:29.890 --> 27:31.650
[JAKE] LAKEVIEW OUTREACH.

27:35.900 --> 27:37.780
[JAKE] I SPOKE TO A CALL GIRL,
HER NAME IS "CHASTITY".

27:37.820 --> 27:40.820
SHE SWEARS THAT SHE WAS
PAID TO DRUG CHRISTIAN
AND TO BRING HIM TO THAT HOUSE.

27:40.860 --> 27:44.700
[LESLIE] OKAY, IF THAT'S TRUE,
SHE'S GOT TO COME IN
AND MAKE A STATEMENT.

27:44.740 --> 27:49.290
[JAKE] I'LL BE IN TOUCH.
[HOOD] EVERYTHING ALRIGHT?

27:49.330 --> 27:50.790
[LESLIE] YEAH.

27:51.920 --> 27:54.540
[CHASTITY] I MET THE GUY AT
THE HOTEL BAR, LIKE WE AGREED.

27:54.590 --> 27:56.880
HE WAS ALL HOPPED UP
ON SOMETHING.

27:56.920 --> 27:58.840
GHB, AND PERCS AND WHATNOT.

27:58.880 --> 28:01.680
BUT HE SEEMED NICE ENOUGH,
SO FINE.

28:01.720 --> 28:02.890
[LESLIE] YOU DIDN'T GIVE
HIM ANY DRUGS?

28:02.930 --> 28:04.890
[CHASTITY] NO,
I NEVER TOUCH THE STUFF.

28:04.930 --> 28:08.220
HE TOOK ME TO SOME PLACE
UP ON SIGNAL HILL.

28:08.270 --> 28:10.060
HE WAS SO SLOPPY
BY THE TIME WE GOT THERE.

28:10.100 --> 28:12.810
HE WAS GETTING ROUGH,
CALLING ME NAMES.

28:12.850 --> 28:15.570
SO I TOOK OFF OUT OF THERE
FIRST CHANCE I GOT.

28:15.610 --> 28:17.650
[HOOD] AND YOU LEFT HIM AT
THAT ADDRESS BY HIMSELF?

28:17.690 --> 28:19.280
[CHASTITY] YEAH.
[LESLIE] I UNDERSTAND

28:19.320 --> 28:23.240
YOU TOLD A VERY DIFFERENT
STORY TO A PAIR OF
PRIVATE DETECTIVES?

28:23.280 --> 28:24.870
[CHASTITY] THE OLD GUY
IN THE HOSPITAL BED?

28:24.910 --> 28:27.870
THEY TRIED TO PAY ME 300
BUCKS TO SAY ALL THAT.

28:27.910 --> 28:29.450
[LESLIE] REALLY?

28:29.500 --> 28:31.290
[CHASTITY] BUT ONCE I REALIZED
THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION

28:31.330 --> 28:33.170
I KNEW I BETTER
COME OUT WITH THE TRUTH.

28:33.210 --> 28:34.750
[HOOD] THAT'S VERY GOOD.

28:34.790 --> 28:39.050
[CHASTITY] LIKE I ALWAYS SAY,
"HONESTY IS AN AWESOME POLICY".

28:39.090 --> 28:40.090
[DES] ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT.

28:40.130 --> 28:41.800
I'M WALLY DUGGAN, ALRIGHT?

28:41.840 --> 28:43.890
I'VE GOT A MILLION DOLLAR LOTTO
TICKET IN MY POCKET.

28:43.930 --> 28:46.930
I NEED TO GET OFF THE ISLAND
BUT THE AIRPORT'S FOGGED IN.

28:46.970 --> 28:49.180
I'M THINKING ABOUT
ESCAPE BY BOAT

28:49.220 --> 28:51.560
BUT I'M A CRIMINAL
WITH A SHORT FUSE AND
A PROCLIVITY FOR VIOLENCE,

28:51.600 --> 28:54.520
I PROBABLY DON'T HAVE THE
PATIENCE OF A MARINER.

28:54.560 --> 28:57.820
ALSO I'M PARANOID.

28:57.860 --> 28:59.820
SO I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T TRUST
THE PROVINCIAL FERRY SERVICE,

28:59.860 --> 29:05.240
SO THAT LEAVES ME WITH...

29:05.280 --> 29:06.320
HOT AIR BALLOON.

29:06.370 --> 29:08.080
[TINNY] HE'S AT THE FORT MOTEL
BY THE HIGHWAY.

29:08.120 --> 29:09.580
[DES] HE'S PROBABLY SOMEWHERE
OVER MONCTON BY NOW.

29:09.620 --> 29:10.950
I'LL NOTIFY NORAD, WHILE YOU--
WHAT?

29:11.000 --> 29:13.920
[TINNY] HERE IS THE HOTEL
CONFIRMATION.

29:13.960 --> 29:16.460
[DES] HOW DID YOU--
THAT CAN'T BE TAUGHT.

29:16.500 --> 29:18.210
[JAKE] HEY THERE
BLOOD HOUND GANG.

29:18.250 --> 29:21.010
HOW IS THE CASE GOING?

29:21.050 --> 29:22.510
[DES] EXCELLENT.

29:22.550 --> 29:25.010
WICKED. DEADLY.

29:25.050 --> 29:26.800
[TINNY] IT IS WHAT IT IS.

29:40.020 --> 29:42.780
&lt;♪♪&gt;

29:56.960 --> 30:00.840
[MALACHY] TELL ME
CHRISTIAN IS GONNA BE OKAY.

30:00.880 --> 30:04.590
[ROSE] WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS,
OKAY? WE ALWAYS DO.

30:04.630 --> 30:07.050
NO HONEY, YOU CAN'T RIGHT NOW.

30:07.090 --> 30:09.140
SORRY.

30:09.180 --> 30:12.770
[MALACHY] IF THERE WAS A PRIEST
HANDY, I'D MARRY YOU RIGHT NOW.

30:12.810 --> 30:14.640
[ROSE] OH GOSH.

30:14.680 --> 30:17.850
WELL WE SHOULD GET THAT
DOCTOR IN HERE TO REDUCE
YOUR DOSAGE THEN.

30:17.900 --> 30:20.270
[MALACHY] YEAH,
MAYBE YOU SHOULD.

30:24.900 --> 30:25.900
[JAKE] THAT'S THE VICTIM.

30:25.950 --> 30:27.110
CHRISTIAN KNEW HER.

30:27.150 --> 30:29.370
THEY WENT TO THE SAME REHAB
CLINIC TOGETHER.

30:33.620 --> 30:35.370
[MALACHY] OH LORD.

30:35.410 --> 30:37.540
[HOOD] IS THE DOYLE WARRANT
READY TO GO?

30:37.580 --> 30:39.130
[LESLIE] SOMETHING
DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.

30:39.170 --> 30:41.500
[HOOD] WHICH PART?
[LESLIE] CHRISTIAN DOYLE,

30:41.540 --> 30:44.340
THE GHB, THAT ESCORT.
WERE YOU BUYING ANY OF THAT?

30:44.380 --> 30:46.260
[HOOD] DOESN'T MATTER.
JUDGE ALREADY DID.

30:46.300 --> 30:48.550
[LESLIE] I THINK WE SHOULD
CHECK OUT TOMMY WINDSOR,

30:48.590 --> 30:50.140
SEE IF HIS TORONTO ALIBI
HOLDS UP.

30:50.180 --> 30:52.140
[HOOD] LOOK, LET ME STOP YOU
RIGHT THERE.

30:52.180 --> 30:54.850
THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE IN PLANS.

30:54.890 --> 30:56.060
YOU'RE OFF THE WINDSOR CASE.

30:56.100 --> 30:58.020
[LESLIE] EXCUSE ME?
WHY?

30:58.060 --> 30:59.850
[HOOD] BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA
MARCH ACROSS THE HALL

30:59.900 --> 31:01.440
AND TELL THE BRASS
TO TAKE YOU OFF IT.

31:01.480 --> 31:04.150
[LESLIE] AND WHY WOULD
I DO THAT?

31:04.190 --> 31:05.440
[HOOD] BECAUSE OF THIS.

31:05.490 --> 31:06.570
[LESLIE] WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

31:06.610 --> 31:08.240
[HOOD] IN YOUR PURSE,
STRANGELY ENOUGH.

31:08.280 --> 31:09.860
[LESLIE] WHAT WERE YOU DOING
IN MY PURSE?

31:09.910 --> 31:11.740
[HOOD] LOOKING FOR A MINT.

31:11.780 --> 31:15.160
THIS TINY LITTLE PILL BOTTLE
COULD STOP YOU CAREER DEAD
IN IT'S TRACKS.

31:15.200 --> 31:18.210
[LESLIE] I WAS GONNA HAND
THAT IN TO EVIDENCE.

31:19.290 --> 31:20.920
[HOOD] RELAX.

31:22.880 --> 31:24.250
IT'S OKAY.

31:27.260 --> 31:28.930
YOU'RE WELCOME?

31:28.970 --> 31:31.340
[LESLIE] I DIDN'T ASK YOU
TO DO THAT.

31:31.390 --> 31:34.470
[HOOD] THIS IS
FOR YOUR OWN GOOD SERGEANT.

31:34.510 --> 31:37.390
JUST LOOKING OUT FOR
YOUR FUTURE HERE.

31:37.430 --> 31:40.270
JUST DON'T FORGET IT IS ALL.

31:40.310 --> 31:42.480
FAVOUR AMONG FRIENDS.

31:42.520 --> 31:45.530
&lt;♪♪&gt;

31:50.610 --> 31:52.950
[DES] WAIT, WAIT WAIT.
THIS IS WALLY'S ROOM.

31:52.990 --> 31:54.530
[TINNY] LETS SEE IF HE'S HOME.
[DES] OKAY.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.580
&lt;KNOCKING ON THE DOOR&gt;
[TINNY] HOUSEKEEPING.

31:59.160 --> 32:01.920
&lt;♪♪&gt;

32:08.460 --> 32:11.050
[DES] WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
I GOT SOME WICKED BUTTERFLIES.

32:11.090 --> 32:11.930
MAYBE WE BETTER CALL JAKE?

32:11.970 --> 32:13.090
[TINNY] YOU GOTTA STEP UP HERE.

32:13.140 --> 32:14.260
BE A MAN.

32:14.300 --> 32:16.310
[DES] OKAY, GO AHEAD.

32:22.190 --> 32:26.150
[TINNY] HE'S SLEEPING.
ARE YOU OKAY?

32:26.190 --> 32:28.740
[DES] POLICE!

32:28.780 --> 32:29.650

32:29.690 --> 32:30.570

32:48.250 --> 32:51.550
[WALLY] &lt;COUGHING&gt;

33:10.530 --> 33:12.700

[DES] I KILLED HIM!
I'M FREAKING OUT!

33:13.820 --> 33:14.700
DON'T TELL JAKE!

33:14.740 --> 33:16.280
OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD!

33:16.320 --> 33:17.240

DON'T TELL JAKE!

33:18.950 --> 33:24.040
[TINNY] CALM DOWN!

33:24.080 --> 33:27.090
[TINNY] ARE YOU OKAY NOW?
[DES] I STILL FEEL
A LITTLE ANXIOUS.

33:30.550 --> 33:32.510
[DES] AH!

33:32.550 --> 33:36.090
[TINNY] NOW CALL 911.
[DES] RIGHT, SORRY.

33:36.140 --> 33:37.510
&lt;KNOCKING ON THE DOOR&gt;

33:39.260 --> 33:40.640
[JAKE] HEY.

33:43.390 --> 33:45.440
[MALACHY] JAKE.

33:45.480 --> 33:47.650
CAN YOU GIVE US A MINUTE?

33:47.690 --> 33:54.110
[JAKE] YEAH.
[CHRISTIAN] HEY.

33:54.150 --> 33:55.700
HOW YOU FEELING?

33:55.740 --> 33:59.160
[MALACHY] SO THIS LUCY WINDSOR,
SHE'S FRESH OUTTA LAKEVIEW

33:59.200 --> 34:01.080
REHAB AS WELL.
[CHRISTIAN] DAD, HUNDREDS OF

34:01.120 --> 34:01.830
PEOPLE GO THROUGH THERE.

34:01.870 --> 34:02.870
IT'S THE BEST IN THE COUNTRY.

34:02.910 --> 34:04.460
[MALACHY] YEAH.

34:04.500 --> 34:06.920
IT LOOKS LIKE A LOT OF FUN.

34:06.960 --> 34:08.170
[CHRISTIAN] IT'S NOT
HOW IT LOOKS.

34:08.210 --> 34:10.040
[MALACHY] WELL,
IT LOOKS PRETTY BAD TO ME,

34:10.090 --> 34:13.460
ESPECIALLY SINCE THEY JUST
DRAGGED LUCY WINDSOR'S BODY
OUT OF THE HARBOUR.

34:13.510 --> 34:15.510
[CHRISTIAN] SHE'S DEAD?

34:21.100 --> 34:24.980
[MALACHY] CHRISTIAN, THE TRUTH.

34:25.020 --> 34:27.850
[CHRISTIAN] I MET LUCY IN REHAB.

34:27.900 --> 34:29.440
WE HAD A THING.

34:29.480 --> 34:31.230
[MALACHY] WHY WOULD YOU
LIE TO ME?

34:31.270 --> 34:33.280
[CHRISTIAN] I COULDN'T
TELL YOU THE TRUTH ABOUT
WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING.

34:33.320 --> 34:35.110
[MALACHY] YOU'RE A LAWYER.
[CHRISTIAN] DAD, WAKE UP.

34:35.150 --> 34:37.110
I'M NO LAWYER.
I'M A BAGMAN.

34:37.150 --> 34:39.240
I PAY THE BRIBES TO THE PEOPLE
WHO NEED TO BE BRIBED.

34:39.280 --> 34:40.740
AND LUCY WINDSOR NEEDED
BRIBING.

34:40.780 --> 34:43.830
SHE GOT ARRESTED FOR DRIVING
WITH A HEAD FULL OF CODEINE.

34:43.870 --> 34:46.710
THE FEDS WERE TRYING TO
CONVINCE HER TO FLIP
AGAINST HER HUSBAND.

34:46.750 --> 34:48.620
HE SENT HER TO ONTARIO TO
STRAIGHTEN HER OUT.

34:48.670 --> 34:51.710
SO IT WAS MY JOB TO CHECK INTO
THE REHAB, GET CLOSE TO HER,

34:51.750 --> 34:54.630
AND CONVINCE HER NOT TO
TESTIFY.

34:54.670 --> 34:57.800
[MALACHY] DID YA?

34:57.840 --> 34:59.470
[CHRISTIAN] BEING
IN THAT CLINIC,

34:59.510 --> 35:03.310
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I WAS
FORCED TO SOBER UP IN YEARS.

35:03.350 --> 35:05.140
I HAD A BLIP,
A MOMENT OF CLARITY,

35:05.180 --> 35:06.350
WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL IT.

35:06.390 --> 35:09.770
LUCY AND I, WE CONNECTED.

35:09.810 --> 35:11.900
IN LOVE, KINDA.

35:11.940 --> 35:14.900
INSTEAD OF CONVINCING HER NOT
TO TESTIFY, I SAID YEAH,

35:14.940 --> 35:19.030
SCREW IT. THAT CROOK
DESERVES TO GO TO JAIL.

35:19.070 --> 35:22.330
SHE AGREED. SHE CHECKED OUT AND
I NEVER HEARD FROM HER AGAIN.

35:22.370 --> 35:24.120
[MALACHY] SO WHAT DO
YOU THINK HAPPENED?

35:25.540 --> 35:30.330
[CHRISTIAN] I THINK
I GOT HER KILLED.

35:30.370 --> 35:33.500
&lt;HEART MONITOR BEEPING&gt;

35:33.540 --> 35:34.960
[CHRISTIAN] YOU NEED A NURSE
OR SOMETHING?

35:35.000 --> 35:37.260
[DR. VINCENT] CLEAR THIS ROOM
PLEASE?

35:37.300 --> 35:38.670

35:38.720 --> 35:41.140

WALLY IS GONE.

35:53.360 --> 35:54.690
IT'S A SAD DAY.

35:54.730 --> 35:58.740
[DES] WELL, AT LEAST YOU'VE
GOT EACH OTHER.

35:58.780 --> 36:00.360
[SHANNIE] TODAY IS A VERY
SAD DAY.

36:00.400 --> 36:01.200
[DES] I'M SERIOUS.

36:01.240 --> 36:04.580
EVENTS LIKE THIS TEND TO BRING
PEOPLE TOGETHER.

36:04.620 --> 36:05.870
[BERNARD] WELL, WE'VE AGREED
TO DELAY THE DIVORCE

36:05.910 --> 36:07.370
PROCEEDINGS.

36:07.410 --> 36:09.160
WHAT COMES OUT OF WALLY IN THE
AUTOPSY.

36:09.210 --> 36:10.500
[BERNARD] BUT APPARENTLY THE
HUMAN BODY DIGESTS WINNING

36:10.540 --> 36:12.540
LOTTERY TICKETS AT AN ALARMING
RATE.

36:12.580 --> 36:19.220
[SHANNIE] HERE, FOR EXPENSES.

36:19.260 --> 36:20.760
[DES] FIFTY BUCKS! SWEET!

36:20.800 --> 36:21.970
[TINNY] GOOD JOB, DES.

36:22.010 --> 36:22.890
YOU BROKE EVEN.

36:22.930 --> 36:25.220
[DES] IT'S STRANGE,
REALLY STRANGE.

36:25.260 --> 36:28.640
I MEAN I KILLED A MAN
AND I FEEL NOTHING.

36:28.680 --> 36:30.730
[TINNY] YOU DIDN'T KILL
ANYBODY, AND YOU WERE CRYING

36:30.770 --> 36:32.980
THE WHOLE TIME THE POLICE TOOK
YOUR STATEMENT.

36:33.020 --> 36:35.360
[DES] SO YOU WANNA MAKE OUT
AGAIN BEFORE WE CALL IT A DAY?

36:35.400 --> 36:37.400
[TINNY] YOU TELL ANYBODY ABOUT
THAT AND I WILL KILL YOU.

36:37.440 --> 36:39.360
[DES] FINE, I PROMISE WON'T
TELL ANYONE ABOUT THE TIME YOU

36:39.400 --> 36:40.700
MADE OUT WITH ME IN THE HOTEL
ROOM.

36:40.740 --> 36:41.860
[TINNY] SHUT UP!

36:41.900 --> 36:46.910
&lt;TINNY'S PHONE RINGING&gt;

36:55.420 --> 36:57.550
[CHRISTIAN] WHAT'S THIS?
[JAKE] SO I CASHED THAT CHECK

36:57.590 --> 37:00.920
OF YOURS, AND ODDLY ENOUGH IT
DIDN'T BOUNCE.

37:00.970 --> 37:02.260
TAKE THIS.

37:02.300 --> 37:05.550
THE NEXT BUS WILL BE AROUND
ANY MINUTE.

37:05.590 --> 37:07.140
[CHRISTIAN] WHERE AM I GOING?

37:07.180 --> 37:09.140
[JAKE] I DON'T KNOW,

37:09.180 --> 37:11.180
NEITHER DOES DAD.

37:12.390 --> 37:14.940
JUST LAY LOW FOR A WHILE, OKAY?

37:14.980 --> 37:17.110

BLOWS OVER.

37:17.150 --> 37:19.440
[CHRISTIAN] I CAN'T LEAVE DAD
RIGHT NOW.

37:19.480 --> 37:20.740
I CAN'T.

37:20.780 --> 37:22.610
[JAKE] CHRISTIAN.

37:22.650 --> 37:25.660
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE ANY GOOD
TO ANYBODY IN JAIL,ANY ALRIGHT?

37:27.780 --> 37:32.160
[CHRISTIAN] BUTTONS.
[JAKE] DON'T START THAT AGAIN.

37:32.200 --> 37:33.540
[CHRISTIAN] OKAY.

37:33.580 --> 37:35.540
TO BE CONTINUED.

37:35.580 --> 37:38.590
&lt;♪♪&gt;

37:46.890 --> 37:49.430
[DR. VINCENT] WHILE WE WERE
WAITING FOR THE RESULTS
OF THE DYE-TEST,

37:49.470 --> 37:52.270
MR. DOYLE SUFFERED
A SECOND MILD HEART ATTACK.

37:52.310 --> 37:54.430
[ROSE] OH MY GOD.

37:54.480 --> 37:56.480
[DR. VINCENT] WHAT WE ARE GOING

IMMEDIATE BY-PASS OPERATION.

37:56.520 --> 37:57.850
[ROSE] OH MY GOD. OKAY.

37:57.900 --> 37:58.980
[DR. VINCENT] YOU SHOULD KNOW,

OUR TEAM HERE IS THE ONE
THE BEST IN THE COUNTRY.

38:03.110 --> 38:06.280
[MALACHY] CAN YOU GIVE
US A SECOND?

38:06.320 --> 38:07.910
[ROSE] HEY.

38:07.950 --> 38:11.330
THIS IS A STANDARD PROCEDURE,
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

38:15.120 --> 38:16.870
[MALACHY] I BOUGHT THIS
FOUR MONTHS AGO.

38:16.920 --> 38:19.880
AND I BEEN CARRYING IT
AROUND LIKE A JERK.

38:19.920 --> 38:22.920
I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE MARRIAGE.
BUT I DON'T CARE.

38:26.550 --> 38:30.180
SO YOU WANNA GIVE IT A GO,
OR WHAT?

38:32.810 --> 38:33.810
[ROSE] YUP.

39:01.210 --> 39:05.090

[DAVID] YOU HEARD ME.
[NIKKI] YOU'RE RIGHT.

39:08.630 --> 39:10.470
I'M SORRY.
THIS IS REALLY NOT FAIR DAVID.

39:10.510 --> 39:13.260
IT'S JUST, THERE IS ALL THIS
GOING ON WITH HIS FATHER.

39:13.310 --> 39:17.940
[DAVID] YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO BE HERE RIGHT NOW
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.

39:17.980 --> 39:25.360
[NIKKI] I'M REALLY SORRY.
HE JUST NEEDS ME RIGHT NOW.

39:25.400 --> 39:28.450
[DAVID] YOU SURE IT'S NOT
THE OTHER WAY AROUND?

39:28.490 --> 39:33.740
&lt;♪♪&gt;

39:33.780 --> 39:35.790
&lt;DOOR BELL RINGING&gt;

39:41.290 --> 39:42.960
[JAKE] LESLIE.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.960
[LESLIE] THEY THREW ME
OFF THE CASE.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.590
MY FIRST REAL CASE AS SERGEANT,

39:47.630 --> 39:50.380
AND I SCREW IT UP,
AND IT'S YOUR FAULT JAKE.

39:50.430 --> 39:51.720
[JAKE] WHAT, MY FAULT?
HOW IS THIS MY FAULT?

39:51.760 --> 39:53.600
[LESLIE] THAT PILL BOTTLE
YOU LIFTED FROM THE SCENE,

39:53.640 --> 39:54.760
THEY FOUND IT.

39:54.810 --> 39:56.850
AND NOW I HAVE TO WEAR IT
FOR THE REST OF MY CAREER.

39:56.890 --> 39:58.600
[JAKE] WHY? WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST TURN IT IN,

39:58.640 --> 39:59.980
LIKE I ASKED YOU TO?

40:00.020 --> 40:05.230
[LESLIE] TO PROTECT YA--
TO PROTECT ME.

40:05.270 --> 40:08.440
I DON'T KNOW. THE POINT IS,
I MADE A MISTAKE.

40:08.490 --> 40:11.410
IT'S YOU JAKE, WE ARE DONE.

40:11.450 --> 40:14.490
THIS JOB IS EVERYTHING TO ME
AND YOU ARE SCREWING ME UP.

40:14.530 --> 40:16.990
I CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE YOU
IN MY LIFE.

40:17.040 --> 40:19.540
[JAKE] LOOK, I'M SORRY.

40:19.580 --> 40:22.500
I AM-- I DIDN'T MEAN
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN.

40:22.540 --> 40:23.540
[LESLIE] I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
COME HERE.

40:23.580 --> 40:26.460
I KNOW THAT,
BUT I CAME ANYWAY.

40:26.500 --> 40:29.260
YOU'RE DRIVING ME CRAZY.

40:29.300 --> 40:31.630
[JAKE] ALRIGHT, WHAT IS IT
THAT YOU WANT ME TO DO?

40:31.680 --> 40:33.680
[LESLIE] YOU KNOW WHAT
THE STUPIDEST PART IS?

40:33.720 --> 40:35.430
I WANT YOU TO KISS ME
RIGHT NOW.

40:35.470 --> 40:36.810
AND I KNOW
THAT IT'S A HUGE MISTAKE

40:36.850 --> 40:39.640
AND I'LL REGRET IT
IMMEDIATELY.

40:39.680 --> 40:42.440
&lt;♪♪&gt;

40:57.490 --> 40:58.450
[NIKKI] OH GOD.

41:00.870 --> 41:02.580
[JAKE] NIKKI?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

41:02.620 --> 41:03.670
[NIKKI] I JUST CAME--

41:03.710 --> 41:05.670
[LESLIE] I'M GONNA TAKE THIS
AS A SIGN, JAKE.

41:05.710 --> 41:08.460
[NIKKI] I CAME HERE BECAUSE
I WANTED-- I JUST WANTED TO--

41:08.500 --> 41:11.510
[LESLIE] GOOD BYE.
THANK YOU.

41:15.300 --> 41:18.260
[NIKKI] I JUST WANTED TO TELL
YOU THAT I'M LEAVING.

41:18.310 --> 41:19.270
FOR GOOD.

41:19.310 --> 41:21.100
I'M GETTING OUT OF THIS TOWN.

41:21.140 --> 41:23.640
I'M DONE.

41:23.690 --> 41:25.350
[JAKE] WHAT?

41:25.400 --> 41:28.650
[NIKKI] THIS IS THE LAST TIME
WE'RE GONNA SEE EACH OTHER
JAKE!

41:28.690 --> 41:30.690
[JAKE] WHAT THE HELL
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

41:41.200 --> 41:43.370
[NIKKI] UGH!

41:43.410 --> 41:48.420
I'M MOVING ON, OKAY?
CAUSE I HAVE TO.

41:56.140 --> 41:59.140
&lt;♪♪&gt;

42:04.640 --> 42:06.310
[ROSE] YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

42:06.350 --> 42:09.650
I'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU, OKAY?
