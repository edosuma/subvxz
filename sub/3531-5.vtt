WEBVTT

02:39.327 --> 02:40.787
What happened to your face?

02:41.162 --> 02:44.958
Pool game the other night,
called the wrong dude on cheating.

02:47.085 --> 02:48.419
You gotta watch that.

02:51.422 --> 02:52.757
What do you want, again?

02:54.551 --> 02:56.302
I'm repping some people.

02:56.386 --> 02:58.888
And they want to get to the good cook.

02:58.972 --> 03:02.475
They'll trade you or the IC Brotherhood,
however you want to do it.

03:02.767 --> 03:04.102
Coke for crystal.

03:07.313 --> 03:08.982
Why ain't I talking to Miles?

03:09.065 --> 03:13.486
Me and Ginger go way back,
boosted together.

03:15.572 --> 03:16.823
You ain't saying much.

03:16.906 --> 03:19.117
I figure I'd let my man give you the details.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.952
Look, this shit I got,

03:21.786 --> 03:24.622
you step on it five, six times, it'll still kick.

03:24.706 --> 03:28.626
This means you got to cook a little more,
for a lot more profit.

03:34.132 --> 03:37.302
I ain't got no use for it. Or your money.

03:38.136 --> 03:40.138
My money don't spend?

03:42.140 --> 03:45.435
I can see your soul at the edges of your eyes.

03:46.060 --> 03:48.521
It's corrosive, like acid.

03:50.565 --> 03:52.609
You got a demon, little man.

03:53.526 --> 03:55.069
And I don't like your face.

03:55.403 --> 03:57.697
It makes me want to do things to it.

03:59.240 --> 04:00.241
Ginger?

04:00.950 --> 04:03.745
You call me again, I'm setting Miles on you.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.790
I see you again,

04:08.541 --> 04:10.001
I'm putting you down.

04:11.336 --> 04:13.713
There's a shadow on you, son.

04:39.405 --> 04:40.615
Marty?

04:40.698 --> 04:43.868
You got him?
You fucking better, the shit I've been through.

04:43.952 --> 04:46.079
I do. I got him.

04:46.454 --> 04:49.582
We're on empty roads now,
so I got to drop back or he'll spot the tail.

04:49.999 --> 04:54.003
<i>That's Reggie Ledoux's cook partner, Dewall.
Bird-dog him, Marty.</i>

04:54.087 --> 04:55.254
Got it.

04:55.338 --> 04:57.131
<i>What's your location?</i>

04:57.215 --> 05:00.051
Just south of I-10
along the Creole Nature Trail.

05:00.134 --> 05:02.971
Heading toward Carlyss. Hurry up, man.

05:03.054 --> 05:04.847
<i>Copy that. On my way.</i>

05:19.821 --> 05:21.656
How we doing back there, Ginger?

05:22.740 --> 05:24.450
Fuck you, motherfucker!

05:26.577 --> 05:27.745
Yeah.

05:31.582 --> 05:33.334
How did you get onto Ledoux?

05:33.418 --> 05:37.922
One of my old CI's tipped me off
the location of his cookhouse.

05:39.507 --> 05:41.926
So I came back on the job.

05:43.928 --> 05:46.931
Didn't want anybody else to catch him,
bring him in.

05:49.434 --> 05:50.768
Look, you want my help?

05:51.436 --> 05:53.521
Just show me the rest of the file.

05:53.604 --> 05:56.357
Why are you so hot to see
the new discovery file, man?

05:58.901 --> 06:00.194
Why are y'all

06:01.070 --> 06:03.906
so hot to not give it to me?

06:05.283 --> 06:07.994
It's supposed to be like a consultation, right?

06:09.078 --> 06:11.581
Yeah, but, you go first.

06:12.457 --> 06:16.002
You take me through it
and I'll let you see what we got.

06:20.381 --> 06:21.799
I'll hold you to that.

06:48.993 --> 06:50.244
<i>Where's Ginger?</i>

06:50.369 --> 06:52.205
Wrapped up in a ditch.

06:52.455 --> 06:53.748
What you got?

06:53.831 --> 06:54.916
Lost him a minute.

06:54.999 --> 06:58.086
I had to double back a few times
till I found the exit.

06:58.169 --> 06:59.712
That's his truck there.

07:00.755 --> 07:03.007
We're gonna have to call this in, Rust.

07:03.633 --> 07:05.593
Eh, we don't want to do that.

07:06.177 --> 07:09.013
Troops will come flood these woods.
They could scatter.

07:12.433 --> 07:14.852
All right, we ain't gonna find him from here.

07:21.067 --> 07:23.111
You ever been hunting, Marty?

07:26.030 --> 07:29.700
Ten-point buck, year before last, 50 yards.

07:32.328 --> 07:34.080
I'm not talking about sitting in a tree house

07:34.163 --> 07:37.041
waiting to ambush a buck
come to sniff your gash bait.

07:37.542 --> 07:39.001
Talking about tracking.

07:39.085 --> 07:40.920
Jesus, you're a prick.

07:41.003 --> 07:43.881
Look, we find the place,
we come back here, we call it in.

07:43.965 --> 07:45.967
One of us stays surveillance, yeah?

07:47.301 --> 07:48.886
I can live with that.

07:50.555 --> 07:51.806
Let's go.

07:51.889 --> 07:54.267
<i>So you got a tip
where Ledoux cooks,</i>

07:54.350 --> 07:57.145
and Cohle came back from wherever he was.

07:57.770 --> 08:00.565
You knew it was gonna get here, man.
Just the once.

08:01.232 --> 08:02.942
The way you tell it.

08:04.569 --> 08:07.113
I tell it the same way
that I told the shooting board

08:07.196 --> 08:10.867
and every cop bar
between Houston and Biloxi.

08:10.950 --> 08:14.871
And you know why
the story's always the same, 17 years gone?

08:15.454 --> 08:18.082
Because it only went down the one way.

08:19.750 --> 08:22.879
<i>Now, Rust's dad taught him bow-hunting.</i>

08:22.962 --> 08:28.926
<i>You know, he had to track game
till he got within maybe 30 yards of it.</i>

08:38.895 --> 08:42.857
<i>Now, this enabled us
to discern the suspect's path</i>

08:42.940 --> 08:48.279
<i>while sidestepping the various
anti-intruder devices they installed.</i>

10:04.939 --> 10:08.317
Trip wires back there.
The clearing's probably mined.

10:09.110 --> 10:10.111
All right.

10:10.736 --> 10:12.530
How do you want to do it?

10:13.489 --> 10:16.367
You go back, call it in. I'll wait here.

10:18.703 --> 10:21.163
- You're gonna hold position?
- Yeah.

10:27.169 --> 10:28.921
Do it now, Marty.

10:29.797 --> 10:32.883
Fuck you. You ain't doing this without me.

10:47.565 --> 10:49.025
All right, stay low.

10:54.905 --> 10:56.699
<i>We were just about to turn back,</i>

10:56.907 --> 10:59.201
call in Parish, State, whoever.

11:00.244 --> 11:01.620
I mean, we had the location,

11:01.704 --> 11:05.249
we had our suspects identified
at the location, you know.

11:05.416 --> 11:08.711
Might as well just leave the shit be
and hand it off.

11:09.045 --> 11:11.589
But that ain't what happened.

11:13.549 --> 11:16.719
No, as soon as we started to back off, man...

11:16.802 --> 11:17.803
Blam!

11:18.387 --> 11:20.514
Bullets cut through right near Rust's head.

11:20.598 --> 11:24.393
We dove opposite ways into the high growth.

11:24.518 --> 11:28.397
But they'd already spotted us,
and they had something high-velocity...

11:28.481 --> 11:29.482
Boom!

11:29.774 --> 11:32.610
<i>Blew apart this tree between us.</i>

11:32.777 --> 11:34.028
<i>I mean, it was on.</i>

11:39.492 --> 11:40.576
Heavy shit.

11:40.659 --> 11:44.872
<i>Fucking ferns and whatnot
bursting all around us, bark flying off of trees.</i>

11:44.955 --> 11:46.290
<i>I mean, we were in a fucking shitstorm.</i>

13:08.706 --> 13:11.584
State Police! Put your hands on your head.

13:12.460 --> 13:14.587
Put 'em on your head, now.

13:14.670 --> 13:16.839
Don't even think about it.

13:17.298 --> 13:19.008
Put your hands on your head right now.

13:19.717 --> 13:21.177
Intertwine your fingers.

13:22.136 --> 13:24.722
Do it! Back up toward me.

13:30.394 --> 13:32.438
Down on your knees. Come on.

13:38.402 --> 13:40.154
It's time, isn't it?

13:41.697 --> 13:43.282
The black star.

13:43.365 --> 13:44.783
Shut the fuck up.

13:58.464 --> 14:01.383
They'd spotted us
before we crossed the forest,

14:01.467 --> 14:05.137
so all we could do was duck for cover, dig in,

14:05.804 --> 14:07.056
try getting closer.

14:09.016 --> 14:10.392
It was chaos.

14:30.037 --> 14:31.372
The black stars rise.

14:33.082 --> 14:34.208
Why the antlers?

14:40.047 --> 14:42.716
Freeze, motherfucker. Put it down. Hands up.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.301
State Police.

14:54.478 --> 14:55.604
Set it down.

14:55.980 --> 14:57.773
I know what happens next.

14:58.691 --> 15:00.651
I saw you in my dream.

15:00.985 --> 15:02.820
You're in Carcosa now

15:03.320 --> 15:04.321
with me.

15:05.489 --> 15:06.907
He sees you.

15:09.660 --> 15:10.661
Marty!

15:21.589 --> 15:23.382
You'll do this again.

15:24.091 --> 15:25.968
Time is a flat circle.

15:26.051 --> 15:29.179
What's that, Nietzsche?
Shut the fuck up. Put it down!

15:29.263 --> 15:31.223
Marty!

15:32.474 --> 15:33.559
There you go.

15:33.809 --> 15:35.728
Black stars.

15:36.645 --> 15:39.898
- They're coming from the sky.
- Put your hands on your head.

16:08.427 --> 16:12.139
<i>While I was hunkered down
behind this old decrepit boat,</i>

16:12.348 --> 16:16.310
Captain America, Marty Hart,
decides he's gonna run deep into the woods,

16:16.393 --> 16:19.730
flank around the back of the house,
where Ledoux's firing at us, right?

16:20.064 --> 16:21.982
Well, he sneaks up behind Ledoux,

16:22.066 --> 16:24.360
and just as Ledoux turns... Bam!

16:25.069 --> 16:26.403
Popped one off in him.

16:26.487 --> 16:28.489
Head shot, clean, dropped him.

16:29.156 --> 16:32.076
His buddy, Dewall, he made a run for it.

16:32.868 --> 16:37.581
And his homemade cracker-ass
security system took care of the rest.

16:42.044 --> 16:43.045
Fuck.

16:45.589 --> 16:49.343
Get the cuffs off him before his blood settles.
We gotta make this look right.

16:57.935 --> 16:59.812
Goddamn. Fuck.

17:24.461 --> 17:25.921
What do we do, Rust?

17:26.004 --> 17:27.131
Fuck him.

17:27.715 --> 17:29.717
Good to see you commit to something.

17:29.800 --> 17:32.886
Now go see to the kids,
and don't bring them out until I say so.

17:45.524 --> 17:50.237
After we confirmed the two deaths
and searched the rest of the premises,

17:51.989 --> 17:53.991
that's when we found the two children.

17:54.324 --> 17:56.285
I mean, we got very lucky.

17:56.618 --> 18:01.081
We just as easily could've been
chewed to pieces by that AK

18:02.124 --> 18:03.500
on approach.

18:17.431 --> 18:21.602
<i>I can say
that I walked away from the experience</i>

18:23.353 --> 18:27.316
with a greater respect
for the sanctity of human life, you know.

18:28.358 --> 18:29.777
Thank you, Detective.

18:29.860 --> 18:31.695
I believe I speak for the board
when I commend you

18:31.779 --> 18:34.782
on the heroism displayed
by you and Detective Hart.

18:37.075 --> 18:39.328
No, we were doing our jobs, sir.

18:49.379 --> 18:52.716
<i>There were the twig sculptures.</i>

18:54.384 --> 18:58.806
<i>And the LSD on hand
matched that of Dora Lange.</i>

19:01.183 --> 19:05.646
<i>Everybody was pretty satisfied
that we got our man.</i>

19:13.320 --> 19:16.907
<i>The boy had been missing since January.</i>

19:17.491 --> 19:20.077
<i>He'd been dead less than a day.</i>

19:24.164 --> 19:26.750
<i>The girl, she hadn't been reported yet.</i>

19:27.417 --> 19:29.336
<i>She was from St. Landry.</i>

19:29.795 --> 19:31.547
<i>Catatonic when we found her.</i>

19:38.095 --> 19:40.347
Why should I live in history, huh?

19:41.723 --> 19:44.184
Fuck, I don't wanna know anything anymore.

19:44.810 --> 19:47.604
This is a world where nothing is solved.

19:48.272 --> 19:51.316
<i>Someone once told me
time is a flat circle,</i>

19:54.653 --> 19:57.614
<i>where everything we've ever done or will do,</i>

19:57.698 --> 20:00.325
<i>we're gonna do over and over and over again.</i>

20:01.451 --> 20:05.664
<i>And that little boy and that little girl,
they're gonna be in that room</i>

20:06.665 --> 20:07.833
again.

20:10.252 --> 20:11.795
And again.

20:12.754 --> 20:13.964
And again.

20:15.966 --> 20:16.967
Forever.

20:17.801 --> 20:20.220
Cohle. Couldn't manage to get shot?

20:20.304 --> 20:21.305
Next time.

20:22.472 --> 20:24.516
- Thanks for not doubting us.
- Never did.

20:24.600 --> 20:27.978
Here they come. Marty, our hero!

20:29.313 --> 20:30.939
Way to go, boys.

20:33.650 --> 20:35.777
Little extra pouring

20:36.737 --> 20:38.322
while I finish this up

20:38.989 --> 20:41.158
with the semi-celebrities?

20:41.408 --> 20:45.495
<i>There's plenty of news stories,
if you care to find them.</i>

20:45.579 --> 20:49.458
<i>I got promoted to Detective Sergeant.</i>

20:49.541 --> 20:54.254
Rust got a commendation for bravery,
basically because I insisted.

20:54.838 --> 20:57.132
And things were

20:58.842 --> 21:01.470
pretty good for a while, I guess.

21:03.347 --> 21:04.848
Come on, get your speed up.

21:07.976 --> 21:10.687
All right.

21:20.697 --> 21:22.324
<i>Maggie came around.</i>

21:23.033 --> 21:26.787
<i>Just, you know, a lot of talking, counseling.</i>

21:26.870 --> 21:29.623
<i>And maybe being in a shootout</i>

21:29.706 --> 21:32.584
kind of opened her up to forgiveness,

21:34.711 --> 21:36.463
or the possibility.

21:36.964 --> 21:38.882
Right to the wall. Right to the wall.

21:41.259 --> 21:43.679
Thank God.

21:44.221 --> 21:46.098
All right. Go take off your skates.
It's time to go.

21:46.181 --> 21:48.725
- One more time, one more time.
- No. No. Please, please, one more time.

21:48.809 --> 21:50.978
All right. One more time around,
then take them off, okay?

21:51.061 --> 21:52.813
Is Daddy coming home yet?

21:52.896 --> 21:53.897
One more time around.

21:53.981 --> 21:55.732
Go on. One more time. One more time.

21:55.816 --> 21:57.025
Okay.

21:59.736 --> 22:01.363
Thanks. I needed that.

22:02.239 --> 22:03.699
I think they did, too.

22:05.742 --> 22:08.078
- Were there others?
- What?

22:09.246 --> 22:11.206
Besides her, were there others?

22:14.042 --> 22:15.043
No.

22:16.712 --> 22:17.713
No.

22:18.755 --> 22:22.050
Maggie, listen, that was a different person.

22:23.093 --> 22:26.596
I lost it, you know, just a little.

22:28.724 --> 22:31.101
I'm back. I'm begging.

22:32.269 --> 22:35.272
I'll keep begging.
I'll go to my grave begging you.

22:36.732 --> 22:38.817
It's not just the affair.

22:41.445 --> 22:43.071
You used to be a good man.

22:46.283 --> 22:50.787
I've cut the booze, five weeks now.
I'm in a program, Promise Keepers.

23:01.923 --> 23:03.925
You have a long road to climb.

23:05.719 --> 23:06.970
Yes, I do.

23:16.897 --> 23:18.315
Few years,

23:19.608 --> 23:20.859
good ones.

23:24.279 --> 23:27.824
<i>Down the line,
one of those set-ups Maggie was so intent on</i>

23:27.908 --> 23:29.159
<i>finally hit.</i>

23:29.242 --> 23:30.660
<i>Doctor, no less.</i>

23:30.994 --> 23:33.997
<i>Yeah, she and Rust had a thing, few years.</i>

23:36.208 --> 23:37.751
He's conflict-oriented,

23:37.834 --> 23:41.505
so, when I deny him small arguments,
it builds up his energy.

23:44.382 --> 23:45.926
Yeah!

23:46.009 --> 23:48.512
Are you ever a match for this dude!

23:51.014 --> 23:52.974
<i>Look, you know about Rust.</i>

23:53.058 --> 23:54.434
<i>During those seven years,</i>

23:54.518 --> 23:58.146
<i>he probably pulled more assists
than any other detective in the state.</i>

23:58.230 --> 24:00.148
<i>Word got around quick.</i>

24:00.232 --> 24:04.111
<i>You want a confession,
see if State Detective Cohle's available.</i>

24:05.237 --> 24:06.822
Your interview technique,

24:06.905 --> 24:09.699
I'm sure there's some secret you can pass on.

24:16.998 --> 24:20.418
Look, everybody knows
there's something wrong with them.

24:21.253 --> 24:23.004
They just don't know what it is.

24:24.047 --> 24:25.966
Everybody wants a confession.

24:26.049 --> 24:30.220
Everybody wants some cathartic narrative
for it. The guilty, especially.

24:32.097 --> 24:33.932
But everybody's guilty.

24:49.156 --> 24:51.908
<i>You know the good years
when you're in them.</i>

24:51.992 --> 24:55.162
Or you just wait for them
until you get ass cancer

24:56.163 --> 24:59.541
and realize that the good years
came and went.

25:01.084 --> 25:04.754
'Cause there's a feeling...
You might notice it sometimes.

25:04.838 --> 25:07.215
This feeling like life has

25:08.425 --> 25:10.594
slipped through your fingers.

25:15.098 --> 25:17.100
Like the future's behind you.

25:18.602 --> 25:20.270
Like it's always been behind you.

25:23.273 --> 25:27.444
You know, I cleaned up,
but maybe I didn't change.

25:28.570 --> 25:30.238
Not the way I needed to.

25:30.322 --> 25:31.656
<i>Give it back.</i>

25:35.619 --> 25:37.037
Give it back!

25:37.120 --> 25:40.290
<i>Remember what I said
about the detective's curse?</i>

25:40.916 --> 25:44.461
The solution to my whole life
was right under my nose.

25:45.587 --> 25:48.131
That woman, those kids...

25:52.510 --> 25:55.013
And I was watching everything else.

26:02.562 --> 26:05.315
<i>See, infidelity is one kind of sin.</i>

26:05.649 --> 26:09.402
But my true failure was inattention.

26:11.112 --> 26:12.614
I understand that now.

26:48.900 --> 26:50.193
Hey, Audrey!

26:55.156 --> 26:57.492
<i>So when do you think
things started to,</i>

26:58.034 --> 27:01.997
how you put it, change again,
with Detective Cohle?

27:04.499 --> 27:06.167
Early on, 2002.

27:06.876 --> 27:11.047
But that was his life.
Mine was steady, like I said.

27:12.048 --> 27:15.802
I'm just trying to understand.
What is it you're going for?

27:15.885 --> 27:18.054
What's the message?

27:19.389 --> 27:21.808
There is no message. It's just me.

27:21.891 --> 27:25.895
What's just you? Your hair? Your clothes?

27:27.063 --> 27:29.399
I mean, I look at Macie...

27:29.482 --> 27:32.193
Women don't have to look
like you want them to, Dad.

27:32.277 --> 27:35.322
No, women.
But I'm talking about my teenage daughter.

27:35.405 --> 27:37.490
And I'm not trying to tell you
what to wear or anything.

27:37.574 --> 27:38.992
I'm just trying to understand it.

27:39.075 --> 27:41.328
Well, who told you you had to understand?

27:41.411 --> 27:42.412
Why would you?

27:53.673 --> 27:54.674
So,

27:55.675 --> 27:57.052
I hear you made cheerleader.

27:57.260 --> 27:59.971
Yeah, there were like 10 other girls
who didn't get it.

28:01.890 --> 28:03.683
I didn't know they had
eighth-grade cheerleaders.

28:04.059 --> 28:06.895
- Well...
- Same as there's football players.

28:27.832 --> 28:29.876
<i>Tell us
what you know about his girl.</i>

28:30.168 --> 28:31.795
Yeah, Laurie.

28:32.462 --> 28:37.300
Yeah. She became chief of something.
Lafayette General, I believe.

28:37.384 --> 28:39.302
You know what happened there
between them?

28:40.804 --> 28:43.556
What always happens
between men and women.

28:43.640 --> 28:44.849
Reality.

29:08.665 --> 29:11.000
- Dad...
- Tell it to your mother.

29:27.016 --> 29:28.977
Deputy found her

29:29.853 --> 29:31.729
parked in a car with two boys.

29:31.813 --> 29:33.857
Come here. Get over here.

29:39.529 --> 29:40.738
What?

29:42.866 --> 29:46.369
Yeah, in states of undress. You know...

29:47.954 --> 29:49.289
Like fucking.

29:50.248 --> 29:51.916
Boys are 19 and 20.

29:52.375 --> 29:54.127
Got them in holding for the night.

29:54.210 --> 29:57.422
Haven't decided
whether to press statch rape charges.

29:57.505 --> 29:59.090
- What?
- You can't do that.

29:59.174 --> 30:01.801
I can do anything
I goddamn want to those boys.

30:01.885 --> 30:03.178
You think about that.

30:03.261 --> 30:05.763
Audrey. Look at me.

30:07.557 --> 30:09.100
Look at me!

30:09.559 --> 30:12.395
What are you thinking? God!

30:13.813 --> 30:17.400
What the fuck is wrong with you?

30:17.692 --> 30:20.904
Or is this one of those things
that I'll never understand?

30:21.070 --> 30:25.158
You know, being the captain
of the varsity slut team.

30:25.366 --> 30:26.367
Marty!

30:28.036 --> 30:29.370
Fuck you.

30:38.755 --> 30:41.090
Get in your fucking room!

30:47.096 --> 30:50.099
- Mom, she hit my head.
- Go to bed. This isn't about you.

30:52.894 --> 30:54.229
Audrey, open the door.

30:55.939 --> 30:57.774
Open the door, Audrey.

31:02.904 --> 31:04.781
Audrey, it's just you and me, honey.

31:06.950 --> 31:08.076
See...

31:10.620 --> 31:12.455
You need to tell me what's going on.

31:14.082 --> 31:16.709
Audrey, open the door, please.

31:20.213 --> 31:21.297
<i>Years.</i>

31:22.048 --> 31:25.385
You ever heard of something called
the M-brane theory, Detectives?

31:25.635 --> 31:28.304
No, that's... That's over my head.

31:28.555 --> 31:31.140
It's like, in this universe,

31:32.141 --> 31:35.478
we process time linearly.

31:36.145 --> 31:37.146
Forward.

31:39.983 --> 31:42.610
But outside of our space-time,

31:43.486 --> 31:46.781
from what would be
a fourth-dimensional perspective,

31:47.323 --> 31:49.200
time wouldn't exist.

31:51.327 --> 31:54.539
And from that vantage, could we attain it,

31:57.208 --> 31:58.459
we'd see

32:02.297 --> 32:04.424
our space-time would look flattened.

32:05.383 --> 32:08.219
Like a single sculpture of matter

32:08.303 --> 32:11.639
in a superposition
of every place it ever occupied.

32:13.558 --> 32:17.687
Our sentience
just cycling through our lives like

32:18.813 --> 32:20.523
carts on a track.

32:26.863 --> 32:29.991
See, everything outside our dimension,

32:31.743 --> 32:33.036
that's eternity.

32:33.911 --> 32:36.831
Eternity looking down on us.

32:38.875 --> 32:40.668
Now, to us,

32:42.211 --> 32:43.463
it's a sphere.

32:44.756 --> 32:46.174
But to them,

32:49.052 --> 32:50.470
it's a circle.

32:58.019 --> 32:59.479
Mr. Cohle.

33:06.402 --> 33:07.445
Mr. Cohle.

33:08.738 --> 33:10.907
What happened in 2002?

33:14.619 --> 33:17.080
<i>Guy Leonard Francis.</i>

33:18.373 --> 33:21.042
<i>They say you killed two people in Livingston.</i>

33:23.086 --> 33:26.172
<i>They say you're the drug store robber.</i>

33:27.256 --> 33:30.051
You know they already
got a nickname for you?

33:31.302 --> 33:35.723
Southern Fried Pharmacy Firearm Thief.

33:37.350 --> 33:39.519
You like that? Got a nice ring to it.

33:39.602 --> 33:41.396
Bit of a mouthful. Fuck.

33:42.689 --> 33:44.482
I'm telling you, man,
the shit they got these days,

33:44.565 --> 33:47.568
technology, fingerprints, DNA.

33:47.694 --> 33:50.029
You gotta be a fucking genius
to get past that shit.

33:50.113 --> 33:52.657
Let's face it, Francis,
you ain't no fucking genius, are you?

33:54.158 --> 33:57.787
First you come in and say,
"I got the drugs from somewhere else."

33:58.121 --> 34:01.791
Then you say, "No, I don't remember.
I don't remember where I got the drugs."

34:02.458 --> 34:04.293
You're making it too complicated.

34:04.377 --> 34:07.255
You're creating a maze for yourself
that you ain't never gonna get out of.

34:07.338 --> 34:08.798
They got you.

34:09.173 --> 34:10.967
You just gotta change your play.

34:12.719 --> 34:14.262
You gotta plead impairment.

34:14.971 --> 34:16.347
You know what that means?

34:17.807 --> 34:20.309
That means
that you cannot be held accountable

34:21.185 --> 34:22.645
for your actions.

34:23.271 --> 34:26.107
Well, I don't think I ought to be blamed,

34:26.524 --> 34:29.861
entirely blamed for things I did

34:29.944 --> 34:32.739
when I was under the influence of anything.

34:33.239 --> 34:34.949
I don't think you should either.

34:35.908 --> 34:38.161
That's what I'm saying. PCP.

34:39.203 --> 34:41.164
Stuff makes a man crazy.

34:41.581 --> 34:43.541
One time, a famous case,

34:44.459 --> 34:47.253
a guy, he cut off his own face on that shit.

34:47.336 --> 34:48.296
- For real?
- Yeah.

34:48.379 --> 34:51.966
You mix that with meth,
that's an insanity defense if I ever heard one.

34:52.175 --> 34:54.844
How are you gonna say
a man who's not on anything

34:54.927 --> 34:56.929
is insane 'cause he did something crazy,

34:57.013 --> 34:59.891
but a man who's on something
that made him crazy

34:59.974 --> 35:01.684
is sane, you know what I mean?

35:01.768 --> 35:03.603
- Works both ways.
- Yeah, exactly.

35:03.686 --> 35:05.772
I mean, I'm not even saying
that I remember anything.

35:05.855 --> 35:07.106
I was shit hammered.

35:07.190 --> 35:09.358
Here we go. That's your play. Right there.

35:09.525 --> 35:11.694
Fuck this amnesia story.

35:12.361 --> 35:13.738
That dirt don't stick.

35:15.198 --> 35:17.116
But insanity defense,

35:18.826 --> 35:20.077
that's your ticket.

35:21.037 --> 35:22.330
That's your way out.

35:23.206 --> 35:26.709
Right? 'Cause you sobered up now.
You got your mind right.

35:27.835 --> 35:29.045
You're back.

35:30.213 --> 35:31.923
You gotta show them the difference

35:32.173 --> 35:36.469
between that madman in that pharmacy
who blew them two people away,

35:36.552 --> 35:38.721
and the man who's sitting here right now.

35:40.515 --> 35:41.891
You gotta show shock.

35:42.767 --> 35:45.061
Terror and re-fucking-morse.

35:45.228 --> 35:47.480
I am. I do. I'm...

35:48.731 --> 35:50.066
I'm scared, sir.

35:50.149 --> 35:52.568
Yeah, you should be. Right?

35:53.152 --> 35:55.321
Now, what'd you say to the pharmacist?

35:58.741 --> 36:01.410
I said, "Give me everything."

36:01.744 --> 36:03.120
And then what?

36:03.871 --> 36:07.083
Boom! Boom!
Blew that fucker away, didn't you?

36:10.378 --> 36:12.255
You want forgiveness for that?

36:13.631 --> 36:15.508
- Yeah.
- Say it.

36:16.592 --> 36:18.511
- I want it.
- You want what?

36:19.679 --> 36:21.097
Forgiveness.

36:26.394 --> 36:28.145
You see what you just did?

36:31.023 --> 36:33.234
You just copped to a double murder.

36:36.320 --> 36:37.947
They got you now.

36:45.121 --> 36:46.789
I wanna make a deal.

36:48.291 --> 36:49.709
A deal about what?

36:50.960 --> 36:52.461
I know things.

36:52.962 --> 36:55.756
What do you know now, all of a sudden?

36:57.925 --> 36:59.176
I know...

37:00.344 --> 37:02.096
I know who you are.

37:03.097 --> 37:06.309
And I know about that woman
y'all found out in the woods, way back.

37:08.561 --> 37:10.021
The antlers.

37:13.232 --> 37:15.735
That don't mean shit.
That was in the newspaper.

37:16.611 --> 37:17.987
What do you know?

37:18.613 --> 37:20.489
You don't know shit, do you?

37:20.573 --> 37:21.574
No.

37:22.325 --> 37:24.410
Y'all never caught the man who did that.

37:25.411 --> 37:26.787
He's been out there,

37:27.705 --> 37:28.789
killing.

37:29.040 --> 37:31.000
You talking out your ass, boy.

37:32.501 --> 37:36.589
You don't know a fucking thing.
You're just trying to buy some time, ain't you?

37:36.672 --> 37:38.049
I met him once.

37:40.051 --> 37:43.012
There's big people who know about him.

37:43.763 --> 37:44.847
Big people.

37:44.931 --> 37:47.224
Ain't no deal, 'cause there ain't no people.

37:47.308 --> 37:50.102
You make me a deal.
You deal with me about these murders.

37:50.186 --> 37:52.897
Ain't no deal. You ain't got nothing,
because you're full of shit.

37:52.980 --> 37:55.691
And there ain't nobody alive
that did none of that killing.

37:56.233 --> 37:57.526
He's dead, boy.

38:00.196 --> 38:01.405
I'll tell you

38:01.822 --> 38:03.699
about the Yellow King.

38:09.622 --> 38:12.124
What the fuck did you say, boy?

38:12.208 --> 38:13.459
Give me a name.

38:15.878 --> 38:17.630
Give me a fucking name.

38:17.922 --> 38:19.715
Fucking say it, boy.

38:19.840 --> 38:21.342
The Yellow King!

38:22.843 --> 38:24.804
Get off me! Get the hell off me!

38:24.887 --> 38:26.389
No, don't! Get off him!

38:26.472 --> 38:28.099
Make a deal with me!

38:28.224 --> 38:30.893
Deal with me, you son of a bitch!

38:30.977 --> 38:32.311
You deal with me!

38:32.395 --> 38:34.355
Get out of here!

38:34.605 --> 38:37.400
Easy! Calm down, man. Calm down.

38:38.067 --> 38:39.694
Take a deep breath, all right?

38:40.236 --> 38:42.488
You got the confession,
then you made it inadmissible.

38:42.571 --> 38:43.823
What do you fucking mean? He's still talking.

38:43.906 --> 38:46.117
He's shucking and jiving.
He knows exactly who you are.

38:46.200 --> 38:47.493
You called me in here? You did.

38:47.576 --> 38:49.495
I know. And if we need anything else,
we'll let you know.

38:49.578 --> 38:50.913
We appreciate the assist, Detective.

38:50.997 --> 38:52.665
What the fuck is going on here?

38:52.748 --> 38:55.126
We have to salvage a double murder
confession is what's going on.

38:56.794 --> 38:59.922
If he wasn't just running you in there,
you'll get anything we get.

39:00.589 --> 39:01.674
You have my word.

39:02.008 --> 39:03.509
Come on. Ease up, baby. Calm down.

39:03.592 --> 39:05.094
- I'll be back. Hear me?
- I got it.

39:05.261 --> 39:06.512
Tomorrow.

39:07.221 --> 39:08.639
Stay the fuck back, I got it.

39:34.206 --> 39:37.626
<i>In eternity, where there is no time,</i>

39:39.253 --> 39:42.381
<i>nothing can grow, nothing can become.</i>

39:44.133 --> 39:45.968
<i>Nothing changes.</i>

39:48.637 --> 39:51.098
So, death created time

39:51.724 --> 39:54.643
to grow the things that it would kill.

39:56.645 --> 39:58.397
And you are reborn.

39:59.815 --> 40:01.817
But into the same life

40:03.194 --> 40:05.279
that you've always been born into.

40:06.447 --> 40:10.076
And how many times
have we had this conversation, Detectives?

40:11.452 --> 40:12.828
Well, who knows?

40:15.581 --> 40:18.375
When you can't remember your lives,

40:19.627 --> 40:22.338
you can't change your lives.

40:24.715 --> 40:28.511
And that is the terrible
and secret fate of all life.

40:31.847 --> 40:33.474
You're trapped

40:36.519 --> 40:40.231
<i>by that nightmare you keep waking up into.</i>

40:46.028 --> 40:47.279
You all right?

40:49.698 --> 40:51.408
We gotta go to Abbeville.

40:53.452 --> 40:55.412
We got a deposition this afternoon.

40:55.496 --> 40:57.873
Push it. I got somebody we need to talk to.

40:57.957 --> 41:00.251
I'll tell you on the way. Come on.

41:03.879 --> 41:06.882
<i>You really think he's serious
about having something?</i>

41:07.424 --> 41:08.801
And if so, then what?

41:13.889 --> 41:18.144
Reggie Ledoux deserved to die, Marty.
That was justice.

41:19.895 --> 41:22.064
But I'm not ruling out other agencies.

41:23.315 --> 41:25.234
What does that mean?

41:27.069 --> 41:30.281
Guy Francis and Charlie Lange
both say the Yellow King.

41:31.740 --> 41:34.702
Dora Lange said the Yellow King.

41:39.248 --> 41:44.086
Okay, look, if the killer's still out there,
why haven't there been more killings?

41:44.587 --> 41:47.756
Well, maybe there have, Marty,
and we just don't know about them.

41:47.840 --> 41:49.550
Haven't put them together.

41:52.928 --> 41:56.265
Ever wonder why that task force
was so hot to take the case

41:56.765 --> 41:58.017
back in '95?

41:59.810 --> 42:02.813
Are you telling me
you think the task force was in on it?

42:18.162 --> 42:19.371
Fuck!

42:26.837 --> 42:28.589
How the fuck does this happen?

42:28.672 --> 42:30.507
You know what he was looking at
with the double murders.

42:30.591 --> 42:32.635
Guess he thought about it and made a choice.

42:34.553 --> 42:35.679
You got a camera feed?

42:41.477 --> 42:43.354
Here, go back. Play this.

42:45.689 --> 42:48.609
He took a phone call
at 7:15. His lawyer.

43:10.756 --> 43:12.841
You got audio on this? Sound?

43:12.925 --> 43:14.260
No, just the vid.

43:19.682 --> 43:21.892
That's it. Just three hours of nothing.

43:24.520 --> 43:26.188
Till you see the blood.

43:37.241 --> 43:40.286
We don't know what somebody
might have told him on that phone call.

43:40.369 --> 43:42.454
I wanna see your incoming call logs now.

43:43.497 --> 43:44.707
All right.

43:45.541 --> 43:47.459
What are the two officers' names?

43:47.543 --> 43:49.211
Childress and Mahoney.

43:49.295 --> 43:51.630
- Give me their files, please.
- Yes, sir.

44:18.824 --> 44:21.410
- Terrence, get prints on this.
- Yes, sir.

44:21.493 --> 44:22.536
Prints?

44:22.745 --> 44:24.288
That's a public phone.

44:25.164 --> 44:27.374
No kind of lawyer makes calls from here.

44:29.460 --> 44:32.963
- Francis have relatives?
- Yeah, sisters. A few nieces, nephews.

44:34.131 --> 44:36.675
Connects to the suicide how?

44:36.884 --> 44:38.886
Well, somebody might have
told him something.

44:40.012 --> 44:41.638
Gave him no choice.

44:46.101 --> 44:47.478
Well, great.

44:48.103 --> 44:49.855
<i>So, when he got
going on this thing again,</i>

44:50.230 --> 44:51.982
did he mention Billy Lee Tuttle?

44:52.316 --> 44:53.901
You know that he did.

44:53.984 --> 44:57.112
Tuttle died a couple of years back. 2010.

44:57.780 --> 45:02.451
Yeah. Yeah, what was that?
Mixed medications? So what?

45:02.534 --> 45:04.995
Right after Cohle showed back up in the state.

45:08.123 --> 45:09.625
Fuck this.

45:10.626 --> 45:11.710
Fuck this bullshit.

45:11.794 --> 45:14.922
You tell me right now
why you're all over Cohle,

45:15.464 --> 45:16.924
or I'll walk.

46:38.714 --> 46:41.049
His record. His reports, his stories.

46:41.383 --> 46:42.468
They don't add up.

46:42.551 --> 46:45.762
So talk to him about it already.
Stop pissing in my ear.

46:45.846 --> 46:48.098
- We did.
- You did?

46:49.600 --> 46:50.642
What?

46:51.602 --> 46:54.229
Well, if you two talked to Rust

46:54.771 --> 46:56.648
and you weren't getting a read on him,

46:57.733 --> 46:59.902
he was getting a read on you.

47:37.147 --> 47:39.066
This is all you got?

47:40.442 --> 47:42.277
Fuck, I already know all this.

47:43.445 --> 47:45.531
And what we have, so far.

47:45.697 --> 47:47.449
You hadn't checked old unsolveds.

47:47.616 --> 47:49.535
Maybe you stop dancing with us.

47:50.619 --> 47:52.704
Tell us what you've really been up to.

47:53.455 --> 47:54.915
How you spend your time.

47:55.165 --> 47:57.459
I already told you how I spend my time.

47:57.543 --> 47:59.586
Except you've been bullshitting us
all afternoon.

47:59.670 --> 48:01.672
Excuse us for one minute, please.

49:14.286 --> 49:16.747
These are from the crime scene
in Lake Charles.

49:16.830 --> 49:18.373
Once folks got word.

49:23.962 --> 49:25.589
Recognize anybody in there?

49:27.758 --> 49:30.344
Lake Charles is a bit
out of the way for you, ain't it?

49:30.427 --> 49:32.512
How'd you
keep her out of the papers?

49:33.013 --> 49:34.723
Maybe you got some friends in

49:36.099 --> 49:37.351
high places?

49:38.226 --> 49:41.271
Your truck
and a man fitting your description

49:41.355 --> 49:44.066
was spotted in the vicinity of our crime scene

49:44.149 --> 49:47.861
five times, by five different people
over the last month.

49:56.912 --> 50:00.582
Now, besides people seeing him
and his truck around the location for weeks,

50:00.666 --> 50:02.959
you know he was off the grid
after he left in '02.

50:03.210 --> 50:06.213
Didn't show up anywhere till 2010. Louisiana.

50:07.756 --> 50:10.175
Got his driver's license renewed.

50:11.677 --> 50:14.888
Nobody knows what he's been doing
in the meantime.

50:15.305 --> 50:17.307
He's got a storage shed
near Church Point.

50:17.724 --> 50:19.434
He won't let us see what's inside.

50:39.579 --> 50:41.832
<i>How about you let us see
what you're keeping in storage?</i>

50:41.957 --> 50:44.710
Fuck no, you can't see my storage unit.

50:45.711 --> 50:46.753
Get a warrant.

50:47.129 --> 50:49.381
Christ, try working a case.

50:49.464 --> 50:50.966
- We are working it.
- Yeah?

50:51.049 --> 50:55.804
See, how we work it is, we think way back.
You put the case on Rianne Olivier.

50:55.887 --> 50:57.639
Put it on her old boyfriend.

50:58.306 --> 51:00.642
I don't know,
maybe the Ledoux boys knew you.

51:01.059 --> 51:03.437
Maybe you traveled the same circles.

51:03.520 --> 51:05.272
Got the same hobbies.

51:05.856 --> 51:07.649
Maybe they had something on you.

51:07.733 --> 51:09.735
You just kept pulling
the right old murders,

51:09.818 --> 51:12.028
take the case wherever you wanted it to go.

51:12.654 --> 51:13.822
You're a juicer.

51:14.448 --> 51:15.449
Ever black out?

51:15.532 --> 51:17.534
Ever wake up,
don't remember what happened?

51:26.168 --> 51:29.212
Look, y'all want to arrest me, go ahead.

51:31.047 --> 51:32.507
You want to follow me...

51:34.009 --> 51:36.553
Come on. You want to see something?

51:39.514 --> 51:40.932
Get a warrant.

51:44.144 --> 51:45.479
Thanks for the beer.

51:46.313 --> 51:50.066
Beyond that,
you wasted my fucking day, company men.

52:36.530 --> 52:38.698
<i>Now, he bartends
four days a week.</i>

52:38.782 --> 52:40.784
This roadhouse
has a little apartment behind it.

52:40.867 --> 52:42.869
No other accounting of his time.

52:42.953 --> 52:44.287
Says he drinks.

52:45.789 --> 52:47.207
You're wrong.

52:47.999 --> 52:51.002
Nobody could change that much.
You are dead wrong.

52:51.086 --> 52:54.005
Hey, you've been telling us all day
about the kind of shit he'd think up.

52:54.089 --> 52:56.591
Way he'd talk.
We got a good earful of that, too.

52:56.675 --> 52:59.261
You're gonna tell me
that's a stable individual?

52:59.344 --> 53:01.680
Left a burnout, junkie rumors.

53:01.763 --> 53:04.349
You think 10 years on the sauce
has made him more reasonable?

53:05.392 --> 53:09.104
Think about this. You said it.
He'd been there three months.

53:09.312 --> 53:12.440
And you two catch a heater
like you've never had before or since.

53:12.524 --> 53:14.860
One that he shines on.

53:15.026 --> 53:17.195
You saying he did such a great job.

53:18.280 --> 53:20.282
Didn't he get you every bit of evidence?

53:20.448 --> 53:22.701
Didn't he push you where he wanted it to go?

53:23.285 --> 53:26.955
He brought you Rianne Olivier.
She wasn't one of Ledoux's.

53:27.956 --> 53:29.374
She was one of his.

53:29.833 --> 53:31.877
What'd he say? "Life is a disease"?

53:32.127 --> 53:35.547
When he heard the Abbeville prisoner,
Francis, knew something, he got on it.

53:35.630 --> 53:36.715
He shut it down.

53:36.798 --> 53:39.134
You ever thought
if he made that phone call to the prisoner?

53:39.217 --> 53:41.928
Like, I don't know,
the guy was trying to blackmail him?

53:42.012 --> 53:44.097
He got on that, too, didn't he?

53:44.347 --> 53:46.433
The idea that the Lange killer
was still out there.

53:49.519 --> 53:50.729
Yeah.

53:50.812 --> 53:52.814
Yeah. Yeah, he did.

53:53.523 --> 53:55.317
Looking for a new patsy, maybe.

54:39.653 --> 54:41.655
<i>Y'all are giving me a lot to absorb.</i>

54:41.988 --> 54:44.199
You're goddamn right
it's a lot to absorb.

54:44.532 --> 54:46.409
- So help us out.
- Yeah.

54:47.243 --> 54:51.498
Whatever you can tell us about, you know,
from when he got on the Lange killer,

54:51.581 --> 54:54.000
up to when you two had your altercation.

54:54.084 --> 54:55.919
Whatever that was about.
