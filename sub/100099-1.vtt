00:01.262 --> 00:02.698
Previously on
Supergirl...

00:02.741 --> 00:04.656
Now, it is time,
you avenge yourself

00:04.700 --> 00:06.484
against the brother
who wronged you.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.791
-Eve.
-Sorry, not sorry.

00:08.834 --> 00:11.794
Can you believe the fourth
estate saved the day?

00:12.882 --> 00:16.059
Kara Danvers
is Supergirl.

00:16.103 --> 00:19.236
Your friends have been
lying to you.

00:26.243 --> 00:27.679
Damn it. The brakes.

00:31.727 --> 00:33.424
Help us! Help!

00:43.391 --> 00:44.827
Thanks, Supergirl.

00:44.870 --> 00:47.438
When I grow up,
I wanna be just like you.

00:47.482 --> 00:49.788
Oh, that's easy,
you just have to fight
for what's right

00:49.832 --> 00:51.616
and always tell
the truth.

00:51.660 --> 00:53.923
Always tell the truth,
that's rich.

00:54.445 --> 00:55.533
Ms. Luthor,

00:56.621 --> 00:57.622
is everything all right?

00:57.666 --> 00:58.754
Why so formal?

00:59.755 --> 01:01.104
I thought
we were best friends.

01:01.974 --> 01:02.801
Kara.

01:04.586 --> 01:06.196
-You know?
-Know what?

01:06.240 --> 01:07.980
That you're a hypocrite
who's been lying to me
for years?

01:08.024 --> 01:09.069
-No, Lena, I didn't--

01:14.900 --> 01:15.727
Terminate.

01:17.207 --> 01:20.036
Virtual reality
simulation terminated.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.259
May I ask you something,
Ms. Luthor?

01:25.694 --> 01:26.825
Yes, Hope.

01:28.436 --> 01:30.438
These simulations you've been
running in virtual reality.

01:30.873 --> 01:32.657
My calculations
show it's possible

01:32.701 --> 01:34.572
they can be achieved
in the real world.

01:34.877 --> 01:36.748
Are you offering
to help me kill Supergirl?

01:37.097 --> 01:40.056
Yes. Would you like me
to facilitate?

01:40.274 --> 01:41.971
I appreciate
the offer, Hope.

01:42.493 --> 01:45.148
You grow more intelligent
and capable by the day.

01:45.975 --> 01:49.065
And your assistance comes
without ambition,
drama, or ego.

01:49.457 --> 01:51.633
-That's why you built me.
-Precisely.

01:52.199 --> 01:54.810
Because I trust in technology,
not people.

01:55.898 --> 01:57.682
People are governed
by feelings.

01:57.943 --> 02:01.904
Anger, hurt, sadness,
and I'm guilty of that too.

02:03.384 --> 02:05.516
That's why I engage
in these simulations,

02:05.560 --> 02:07.605
to excise these emotions.

02:09.564 --> 02:10.826
I'm not a villain.

02:12.523 --> 02:14.743
I don't want to kill Supergirl,
I just want her to experience

02:14.786 --> 02:16.919
the same hurt
she inflicted on me.

02:17.354 --> 02:19.051
And soon enough she will.

02:38.245 --> 02:39.507
-Pardon me.
-Whoa!

02:41.073 --> 02:43.075
Thought I was gonna be late,
but looks like I turned up

02:43.119 --> 02:44.076
just at the right time.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.991
What is going on
with these people?

02:46.035 --> 02:48.037
-They're completely oblivious.

02:48.080 --> 02:50.170
I would say that
they were Slattorians.

02:50.431 --> 02:52.955
A race of aliens I came across
during an investigation.

02:52.998 --> 02:57.220
Oh, your PI powers of deduction
are failing you, J'onn J'onzz.

02:57.481 --> 02:59.570
The silver eyes
are courtesy of Obsidian North.

02:59.614 --> 03:01.137
Isn't that the company
you're working for, Kelly?

03:01.181 --> 03:02.878
Today is
my official first day.

03:03.705 --> 03:05.794
Those are augmented
reality contact lenses

03:05.837 --> 03:08.100
that we're beta testing.
The people with the silver eyes

03:08.144 --> 03:10.364
that are staring at the void
above the cashier?

03:10.407 --> 03:11.930
They're actually
looking at a virtual menu.

03:11.974 --> 03:13.105
I'll show you.

03:13.149 --> 03:14.803
So when you wear
the contact lenses,

03:14.846 --> 03:17.414
you're linked
to tons of people
on a social media platform,

03:17.458 --> 03:19.329
and they can connect
without saying a word.

03:19.373 --> 03:20.939
Kind of like you and me.

03:20.983 --> 03:22.463
You guys are so cute.

03:22.506 --> 03:25.466
But those contact lenses
creep me out.

03:25.727 --> 03:27.946
Just call me when you can
register to vote

03:27.990 --> 03:29.121
with a gesture.

03:29.731 --> 03:30.688
'Cause, look, there's about

03:30.732 --> 03:32.124
to be a special election,

03:32.168 --> 03:34.126
and did you know that
voter registration is down?

03:34.170 --> 03:35.476
People don't wanna
pay attention

03:35.519 --> 03:36.999
to what's happening
in the real world.

03:37.042 --> 03:39.001
Yeah, but, you know,
some good things
have happened

03:39.044 --> 03:41.656
since your article came out
and took down President Baker,

03:41.699 --> 03:42.874
exposed Lex Luthor.

03:42.918 --> 03:44.441
And somebody...

03:44.485 --> 03:47.705
is being presented
with a Pulitzer tomorrow

03:47.749 --> 03:49.446
'cause you're the one
that helped make it happen.

03:49.490 --> 03:52.449
It does feel good
to have my work recognized,

03:52.493 --> 03:54.321
but I just thought
after Baker was ousted,

03:54.364 --> 03:56.453
more people would be hungry

03:56.497 --> 03:58.412
and ready to fight
for social change.

03:59.151 --> 04:00.283
And now it just seems like

04:00.327 --> 04:02.154
everyone's hiding behind
their gadgets.

04:02.198 --> 04:03.982
Technology does
a lot of good too, Kara.

04:04.026 --> 04:07.116
In my new job, I am going to be
using Obsidian's VR tech

04:07.159 --> 04:10.293
to heal the brains
of dementia and PTSD patients.

04:10.337 --> 04:13.818
Touche. I'm a curmudgeon.
Your new job sounds amazing,

04:13.862 --> 04:16.386
and I'm so glad we're working
in the same building.

04:16.430 --> 04:18.040
Big Belly Burger lunches.

04:18.083 --> 04:20.172
Ooh, look at
the time. I gotta fly, guys.

04:20.216 --> 04:22.043
I'm teaching a Tai Chi class
to a group of kids.

04:22.087 --> 04:23.437
Oh,
that's wonderful, J'onn.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.482
Yeah, I'm living
with clarity and purpose.

04:25.526 --> 04:27.528
-It's gonna be great.
-You know what
would not be great

04:27.571 --> 04:29.094
is me being late
for my first day.

04:29.138 --> 04:30.487
-No.
-Okay, I gotta run, bye.

04:30.879 --> 04:32.141
-Bye.
-Bye.

04:32.750 --> 04:35.449
Hey, how did it go
with Lena last night?

04:35.492 --> 04:36.841
-I mean, I'm dying to hear.

04:36.885 --> 04:39.540
Oh, no, I know that face.

04:39.583 --> 04:41.672
Are you ser-- You didn't say
anything? You didn't tell her?

04:41.716 --> 04:43.892
It's not my fault,
I had to take the dog
to the vet.

04:44.371 --> 04:46.242
You don't have a dog, Kara.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.200
My neighbor's dog.
Mrs. Stein.

04:48.244 --> 04:50.551
-Oh, come on.
-She needed my help.

04:50.594 --> 04:52.509
You have to tell Lena
that you're Supergirl,

04:52.553 --> 04:54.206
-but--
-When I told you to hold off,

04:54.250 --> 04:55.643
I just meant for one night.

04:55.686 --> 04:57.384
But there's been
so much going on.

04:57.906 --> 04:59.821
I'm covering
the special election,

04:59.864 --> 05:02.519
and with the dog,
and I'm helping you

05:02.563 --> 05:04.956
recover all those prisoners
from the DEO desert facility.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.916
And the DEO and I
very much appreciate that.

05:08.569 --> 05:09.918
But you're doing all
these other things

05:09.961 --> 05:12.312
when there's just one thing
that you need to do.

05:14.575 --> 05:15.576
I know.

05:16.925 --> 05:18.709
I've just put it off
for so long,

05:18.753 --> 05:21.364
and now...

05:21.408 --> 05:23.061
I'm being given an award

05:23.105 --> 05:25.542
for my tireless pursuit
of the truth,

05:25.586 --> 05:26.804
and I'm a liar.

05:28.502 --> 05:30.895
-I'm terrible.
-You're not terrible.

05:30.939 --> 05:32.244
You're just scared.

05:32.288 --> 05:33.768
I am so scared.

05:34.421 --> 05:37.554
I'm so scared that
she's never gonna
forgive me, Alex.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.296
I mean what kind of person
lies to their best friend

05:40.340 --> 05:41.341
for this long?

05:42.254 --> 05:43.255
Look, I...

05:43.473 --> 05:45.606
have told you
a gazillion times,

05:45.649 --> 05:47.434
you are the bravest person
that I know.

05:47.956 --> 05:50.872
Okay? So, be brave
and tell her.

05:51.176 --> 05:52.264
You're right.

05:52.569 --> 05:54.615
Yeah, we're having lunch
today,

05:54.658 --> 05:56.094
-I'll tell her today.
-Good.

05:56.138 --> 05:57.444
I believe in you.

05:59.097 --> 06:01.622
-No, Hannibal Lecter,
he eats people.
-Miranda Priestly.

06:01.665 --> 06:03.406
Miranda Priestly?
Are you serious?

06:03.450 --> 06:06.148
I'm as serious
as the pursed lips
of Miranda Priestly.

06:07.062 --> 06:08.933
Okay, good,
you guys can help me
prove a point.

06:08.977 --> 06:10.761
Who is is the greatest
movie villain of all time?

06:10.805 --> 06:12.197
- Voldemort.
- Hans Gruber.

06:12.633 --> 06:14.548
Impressively unhelpful.

06:15.375 --> 06:18.116
Well, I guess you'll just
have to accept
that I'm right.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.683
Hmm. This Earth custom

06:19.727 --> 06:21.424
that the girlfriend
is always right

06:21.468 --> 06:24.427
is illogical and frustrating,

06:25.341 --> 06:26.821
but I can assimilate.

06:27.735 --> 06:29.563
Are you ready for work,
Agent Dox?

06:29.606 --> 06:31.478
-Right beside you,
Director Danvers.
-Great.

06:31.782 --> 06:33.436
-Bye, Brainy.
-Bye, Nia.

06:33.480 --> 06:34.655
Oh.

06:37.266 --> 06:39.094
Sorry.

06:39.137 --> 06:40.965
-Let's go, Nia.
-Let's go.

06:41.531 --> 06:44.795
Now, listen, guys,
I don't care if it's 500
or 5,000 words,

06:44.839 --> 06:46.536
the most important thing
that we can do

06:46.580 --> 06:48.320
is to report everything

06:48.364 --> 06:49.583
that we can find
on each candidate.

06:51.019 --> 06:52.412
That way our readers
can make an informed decision.

06:53.761 --> 06:55.850
And if you dive deep,
maybe you too

06:56.677 --> 06:57.591
can win a Pulitzer.

07:12.736 --> 07:14.172
-Hi.
-Hi.

07:14.216 --> 07:15.826
Hello, uh,
can I help you?

07:16.523 --> 07:18.089
Not unless you brought
a light meter.

07:19.090 --> 07:21.528
This office is in dire need
of solar window treatments.

07:22.267 --> 07:23.181
I'm sorry, who are you?

07:23.225 --> 07:25.053
Oh, my God,
I am so rude.

07:25.096 --> 07:26.663
Andrea Rojas.
And you?

07:26.707 --> 07:27.664
Kara Danvers.

07:27.708 --> 07:29.318
Kara? Such a pleasure.

07:29.361 --> 07:32.321
-I'm a big fan.
- Oh, that's
very kind of you.

07:32.800 --> 07:36.804
And did you say Rojas,
as in Obsidian North?

07:36.847 --> 07:37.979
The one and only.

07:38.022 --> 07:40.285
Right, uh, well, I'm sorry,
Ms. Rojas,

07:40.329 --> 07:42.374
I think the elevator
dropped you off
on the wrong floor.

07:42.418 --> 07:43.854
Obsidian's one down.

07:45.247 --> 07:46.378
Oh, my goodness.

07:47.075 --> 07:48.380
Lena didn't tell you,
did she?

07:48.424 --> 07:50.295
-Didn't tell her what?
- James Olsen.

07:50.339 --> 07:52.950
I am glad you're here.
I'm a big admirer of yours.

07:53.690 --> 07:56.388
So don't think for
one moment that I won't
find a place for you here.

07:57.781 --> 08:01.263
Find a place for me here?

08:01.306 --> 08:02.438
I bought CatCo.

08:03.265 --> 08:05.223
Actually, I bought
the whole building,

08:05.267 --> 08:06.921
but CatCo is
the major acquisition.

08:07.617 --> 08:09.706
And I'm taking over
as editor-in-chief.

08:12.622 --> 08:15.669
Welcome to the Lost World
of Krypton exhibit.

08:15.712 --> 08:16.931
-Go ahead, take a look.

08:18.106 --> 08:20.238
Now, many of these items
were generously donated

08:20.282 --> 08:21.805
by Supergirl and Superman,

08:21.849 --> 08:24.808
including the pod
that Superman flew
to Earth in as a baby.

08:24.852 --> 08:26.027
Isn't that cool?

08:26.897 --> 08:30.031
Okay, now who wants
to experience

08:30.074 --> 08:32.773
the Phantom Zone?

08:32.816 --> 08:34.948
Where time does not pass?

08:34.991 --> 08:37.342
Okay, come on,
everybody, follow me.

08:40.868 --> 08:41.782
Hey, kiddo.

08:42.826 --> 08:44.131
Hey, come on
and join us.

08:45.481 --> 08:46.569
What are you doing?

08:54.795 --> 08:55.839
What?

08:59.887 --> 09:00.931
Kara.

09:00.975 --> 09:02.933
Finally. It's been ages.

09:03.194 --> 09:05.240
Hey, is everything okay
at CatCo?

09:05.283 --> 09:07.111
I have six missed calls
from James.

09:07.155 --> 09:08.504
Actually...

09:08.722 --> 09:11.420
Andrea Rojas showed up
in his office

09:11.463 --> 09:14.336
about a half an hour ago
saying she bought CatCo?

09:14.989 --> 09:17.339
-Why would she do that?
-Oh, thank God.

09:17.382 --> 09:20.603
I told James
and Nia there must have
been a huge mistake.

09:20.647 --> 09:22.431
It's not a mistake,
Kara, I...

09:23.258 --> 09:24.738
sold CatCo to Andrea.

09:24.999 --> 09:26.870
She wasn't supposed
to show up till tomorrow

09:26.914 --> 09:28.568
after you and I
had had lunch.

09:30.700 --> 09:33.660
You sold CatCo
without telling any of us?

09:33.703 --> 09:35.749
To be honest, Kara,
I only bought the company

09:35.792 --> 09:37.664
because I knew
how much it meant to you,

09:37.707 --> 09:40.667
and it's frankly left me
strapped for capital,

09:40.710 --> 09:42.843
which I desperately
need for a new venture

09:42.886 --> 09:44.671
that I'm working on.

09:44.714 --> 09:46.281
When Andrea called,
it was just too good
of an offer to pass up.

09:46.803 --> 09:48.849
I... I had no idea...

09:49.850 --> 09:52.635
-I completely understand.
-Andrea and I go way back.

09:52.679 --> 09:54.289
I mean, since boarding school.

09:54.855 --> 09:56.770
And she is a brilliant
business woman.

09:56.813 --> 09:59.163
I would not have sold her
CatCo if I didn't think
she would do a great job.

09:59.207 --> 10:00.600
Oh, of course.

10:02.384 --> 10:03.646
Why didn't you tell me
beforehand?

10:03.690 --> 10:04.865
I was a coward.

10:06.518 --> 10:08.085
And I hope that
you don't feel like

10:08.129 --> 10:09.652
I made you out to be
too much of a fool

10:09.696 --> 10:11.088
by keeping you
in the dark.

10:12.176 --> 10:14.352
-No.
-You're my best friend,

10:14.396 --> 10:15.658
and here I go,
once again

10:15.702 --> 10:18.052
proving that you are
more virtuous than I am.

10:18.095 --> 10:20.576
But I never did purport
to be a saint.

10:24.101 --> 10:25.320
I've ordered some lunch in.
It should be arriving soon.

10:25.363 --> 10:27.365
Why don't you fill me in?
I mean, how are you?

10:27.409 --> 10:30.064
-How have you been?
-Oh, I've, um...

10:33.067 --> 10:34.198
You know what,
actually there is something

10:34.242 --> 10:37.158
I wanna talk
to you about, I...

10:39.377 --> 10:40.683
Kara, there's
an incident at the museum,

10:40.727 --> 10:41.945
-can you get there?
-You know what, Lena?

10:41.989 --> 10:44.339
I'm so sorry, a huge source

10:44.382 --> 10:46.820
for one of my articles
is trying to meet,

10:46.863 --> 10:49.605
he's impossible to pin down,
I got... I have to run.

10:49.649 --> 10:50.824
-I'm sorry.
-I'll just see you tomorrow

10:50.867 --> 10:52.956
-at the Pulitzer party.
-Right, yeah.

11:02.618 --> 11:04.272
Well, this is
new and terrible.

11:10.191 --> 11:12.062
Where's an asteroid
when you need one?

11:23.334 --> 11:24.161
Ew.

11:25.467 --> 11:26.947
Alex said
you might need my help.

11:26.990 --> 11:28.078
Let's get the dino.

11:34.258 --> 11:36.696
J'onn, J'onn,
hey, hey.

11:37.044 --> 11:37.914
Can you hear me?

11:48.055 --> 11:49.796
I've never experienced
anything like it.

11:50.057 --> 11:52.929
That T. rexmust've caused
some kind of psychic paralysis.

11:53.713 --> 11:54.975
Any intel on
the dinosaur?

11:55.236 --> 11:56.367
A shapeshifter.

11:56.411 --> 11:58.326
-White Martian?
-No, I would've known.

11:58.369 --> 12:01.503
I'm guessing this alien
didn't want just another ride.

12:02.809 --> 12:04.593
Kryptonian pods
use antimatter

12:04.636 --> 12:05.725
to propel them through space,

12:05.986 --> 12:07.901
and I know it's
a long shot, but...

12:08.162 --> 12:09.641
can the engine be used...

12:09.685 --> 12:10.991
To make a bomb?

12:12.514 --> 12:14.168
It would require
great skill

12:14.429 --> 12:18.128
and enormous resources.
But it is possible.

12:18.172 --> 12:19.695
-How destructive?
-Strong enough to destroy

12:19.739 --> 12:21.958
all life across
three solar systems.

12:22.002 --> 12:22.872
Oh, well...

12:23.917 --> 12:25.266
We face
an even graver problem,

12:26.528 --> 12:28.660
Supergirl's cape
has been destroyed.

12:28.704 --> 12:31.011
Oh, yes, uh...

12:31.054 --> 12:32.664
I totally forgot about
the risk to life

12:32.708 --> 12:34.144
across three solar systems.

12:34.188 --> 12:35.842
This is no time
for sarcasm,

12:35.885 --> 12:37.887
however dry
or well-crafted.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.586
Supergirl's cape
is uniquely suited
for the needs

12:41.630 --> 12:43.066
of high-speed
superhero maneuvers.

12:43.719 --> 12:45.547
And believe me,
when a Farfarmniflatch

12:45.590 --> 12:48.463
is pursuing you across
the poisonous prison pits
of Takron-Galtos,

12:48.506 --> 12:50.073
you will wish
for those heady days of old

12:50.117 --> 12:52.336
when your cape
allowed you for
an easy sharp right turn.

12:52.380 --> 12:53.381
Oh, yes.

12:54.556 --> 12:56.036
I...

12:56.079 --> 12:57.733
I shall repair your cape.

12:58.255 --> 13:01.737
And we will forget
this sartorial disaster
ever occurred.

13:02.172 --> 13:03.695
We'll get whoever's
behind this.

13:08.091 --> 13:10.528
My father runs
Obsidian headquarters
in Buenos Aires.

13:10.572 --> 13:12.966
He's consumed with
the space colonization rivalry

13:13.009 --> 13:14.358
with Uncle Elon.

13:14.402 --> 13:16.839
-Musk?
-Mmm-hmm.
Which works in my favor

13:16.883 --> 13:18.362
because Dad turned the entire

13:18.406 --> 13:21.365
virtual and augmented
reality business over to me.

13:21.409 --> 13:25.021
This is our VR gym,
where our VIP customers

13:25.065 --> 13:27.807
can scale El Capitan
from the safety
of our office.

13:28.068 --> 13:30.505
Or if they're like me,
they can do a couple

13:30.548 --> 13:33.073
of half-baked crunches
on the Sao Paulo beach...

13:33.116 --> 13:35.031
-...while scrolling
through Instagram

13:35.075 --> 13:36.119
on their phones.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.078
Here's our new medical wing.

13:39.949 --> 13:42.865
I am so excited
for this opportunity,
Ms. Rojas.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.127
As you should be.

13:44.519 --> 13:46.826
This is a special moment
in time.

13:47.174 --> 13:49.741
I'm determined
to have Obsidian tech
in every household

13:49.785 --> 13:50.830
within the year.

13:51.439 --> 13:53.267
Well, my worlds
are colliding.

13:53.310 --> 13:56.183
-Lena.
-I see you have a good eye
for staffing.

13:56.226 --> 13:58.446
Well, you know I only
do business with the best.

13:58.750 --> 14:00.013
Are you enjoying
the contacts I gave you?

14:00.840 --> 14:02.189
Could we talk privately?

14:04.626 --> 14:06.584
-We had a deal.
-That's right.

14:06.933 --> 14:11.111
CatCo Worldwide Media
for $1.3 billion.

14:11.502 --> 14:13.287
A little more than my board
thought it was worth,

14:13.330 --> 14:15.550
but I'm a softie
for an old friend in need.

14:15.593 --> 14:18.814
I'm talking about the deal
to keep the CatCo sale
secret until tomorrow.

14:19.032 --> 14:20.860
Instead you're upstairs
measuring the drapes.

14:21.686 --> 14:23.819
Well, I'm sorry
I ruffled your feathers.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.821
I didn't think a few hours
would make a difference.

14:25.865 --> 14:26.866
Look...

14:28.215 --> 14:29.869
I want us to start off
on the right foot here.

14:30.695 --> 14:32.741
CatCo isn't the end all
of what we can offer
each other.

14:32.784 --> 14:34.090
I agree.

14:34.134 --> 14:35.787
If we are to have
a relationship again,

14:35.831 --> 14:38.616
and I ask you not to disclose
something for 24 hours,

14:38.660 --> 14:40.401
I expect you to
take me at my word.

14:41.358 --> 14:43.143
Everything I do
has a purpose.

14:44.144 --> 14:46.537
-Understood.
-Just no more surprises.

14:47.364 --> 14:48.975
And that big story
you promised me,

14:49.018 --> 14:51.107
the one that would draw
every eyeball in the world

14:51.151 --> 14:52.456
to CatCo's website?

14:52.717 --> 14:54.676
So long your hands
were kept clean of it.

14:56.069 --> 14:58.462
You'll get it tomorrow night
at 9:00 p.m. as promised.

14:59.376 --> 15:00.682
I keep my word.

15:31.321 --> 15:34.194
This room,
look at this room.

15:35.151 --> 15:37.414
It's practically
overflowing with talent.

15:37.893 --> 15:40.287
Journalism's
best and brightest.

15:40.548 --> 15:42.028
And tomorrow,
we'll be joined by

15:42.071 --> 15:43.507
the renowned William Day.

15:43.551 --> 15:45.379
-From The Timesof London?
-Yes.

15:46.293 --> 15:48.948
Because as stacked
as we are already,

15:49.209 --> 15:51.341
we can always be bigger.

15:51.385 --> 15:54.214
We can always be stronger.
We can always be better.

15:54.779 --> 15:55.911
And together,

15:57.391 --> 15:59.132
we're gonna create
a world-class news
organization

15:59.175 --> 16:02.874
that drives consumer
cross-platform engagement.

16:02.918 --> 16:04.572
I'm sorry, uh...

16:04.615 --> 16:06.922
-consumer cross-platform...
-Engagement.

16:07.401 --> 16:09.272
Eyeballs, revenue,

16:09.751 --> 16:12.449
we're gonna take your
already-brilliant work

16:12.493 --> 16:14.712
and we are gonna sharpen it
until it's deadly,

16:15.278 --> 16:16.236
and we're gonna monetize it.

16:16.497 --> 16:17.889
With all due respect,
Ms. Rojas,

16:17.933 --> 16:19.021
we don't allow revenue

16:19.065 --> 16:21.023
to drive
editorial decisions here.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.198
And it shows.

16:24.374 --> 16:25.897
You've been running
the ship, James.

16:25.941 --> 16:27.160
How's subscribership?

16:28.770 --> 16:29.901
It's down.

16:29.945 --> 16:31.077
Who wants that?

16:31.991 --> 16:33.775
When Ms. Danvers
won the Pulitzer,

16:33.818 --> 16:35.211
readership tanked.

16:35.646 --> 16:38.519
It gives a certain kind
of impression that

16:38.562 --> 16:40.434
the paper is pedantic,

16:40.477 --> 16:43.176
it's heavy, it's dull,
like homework.

16:43.219 --> 16:44.220
That's insane.

16:45.265 --> 16:46.179
No, Kara...

16:47.310 --> 16:49.573
what's insane is
branding a company

16:49.617 --> 16:51.880
in a way that causes
people to click away
from the site.

16:51.923 --> 16:53.795
The news is not
about clicks.

16:53.838 --> 16:56.624
Everything is about clicks.

16:57.625 --> 17:00.758
From Fortune 500 companies
selling their wares

17:00.802 --> 17:03.935
to a new mom
posting her child's birthday,

17:03.979 --> 17:08.114
today the measure
of worth is on a click.

17:08.853 --> 17:11.247
To survive,
CatCo needs to pivot.

17:12.117 --> 17:15.382
Attention spans
have plummeted along
with revenues.

17:16.339 --> 17:19.299
Readers want
watercooler news

17:19.342 --> 17:21.866
that's just fun to read
and just as easy to digest.

17:22.301 --> 17:23.607
That, um...

17:25.131 --> 17:26.480
I'm pretty sure I can speak
for everybody in the room

17:27.002 --> 17:29.483
when I say that
if that is the kind of content

17:29.526 --> 17:31.050
that you wanna
create here,

17:31.615 --> 17:32.790
we will walk.

17:34.314 --> 17:35.184
This is not what
we signed up for.

17:37.360 --> 17:38.666
But it literally is.

17:40.233 --> 17:44.759
You're all on a brand-new,
three-year contract.

17:46.674 --> 17:49.329
If you're not interested
in helping me drive
CatCo into the future,

17:49.372 --> 17:52.854
you are more than welcome
to side roll out of the car,

17:54.073 --> 17:55.204
just as I am welcome

17:55.248 --> 17:57.119
to exercise
your non-compete clauses.

17:57.902 --> 17:59.469
I'd hate to see such talent

17:59.513 --> 18:01.210
be driven permanently
from the business.

18:01.863 --> 18:03.038
But if your heart
isn't in it,

18:04.474 --> 18:05.562
let me know.

18:06.694 --> 18:07.912
Well, that's it.

18:09.653 --> 18:10.959
Cheers to the future.

18:13.570 --> 18:16.443
Kara, we found
Superman's pod.

18:21.404 --> 18:22.536
Jeez.

18:23.189 --> 18:24.842
You were right, Brainy,
this cape damage

18:24.886 --> 18:26.540
is terrible
for aerodynamics.

18:26.583 --> 18:28.368
I keep keeling over
to the right,

18:28.411 --> 18:30.065
I almost landed
in a lake.

18:30.109 --> 18:33.112
Well, fear not,
I am deeply engaged
in finding a solution.

18:33.590 --> 18:35.462
And yet, that is
the least of our problems.

18:35.766 --> 18:38.334
The DEO just picked up
a massive energy signature,

18:38.378 --> 18:39.553
and it's not a bomb
like we thought.

18:39.596 --> 18:40.989
It's a homemade
Phantom Zone projector.

18:41.032 --> 18:43.165
Whoever built this
seems to have been

18:43.209 --> 18:45.689
stealing rare, high-security
materials for weeks

18:45.733 --> 18:48.562
from various armories,
laboratories, and
government agencies.

18:48.910 --> 18:49.780
But not from us.

18:51.521 --> 18:52.566
The pod's antimatter
engine was the final
piece of the puzzle.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.743
So they've spent weeks
building a Phantom Zone
projector,

18:55.786 --> 18:57.353
turned it on,

18:57.397 --> 18:58.876
and just left it
on the ground?

18:58.920 --> 19:00.574
It's almost as if
they wanted us to find it.

19:01.401 --> 19:02.619
Only question is, why?

19:03.620 --> 19:04.534
Trap.

19:16.242 --> 19:18.287
There is no hiding
from Midnight...

19:18.331 --> 19:21.203
-...murderer of multitudes.

19:21.247 --> 19:22.770
I'm Kara Zor-El.

19:23.423 --> 19:26.295
My mother put many prisoners
in the Phantom Zone,

19:26.339 --> 19:28.123
I assume you're here
for me.

19:28.428 --> 19:30.256
But don't take your fury out
on this planet

19:30.299 --> 19:31.692
just because
she locked you up.

19:31.735 --> 19:33.650
Your mother
didn't lock her up.

19:36.349 --> 19:37.959
-I did.
- J'onn J'onzz.

19:50.972 --> 19:52.626
Those
are energy voids.

19:52.669 --> 19:54.323
They destroy
everything they touch.

19:54.367 --> 19:55.759
Can you phase
through them?

19:55.803 --> 19:57.152
I'll try.

20:10.992 --> 20:13.299
Supergirl, the projector.

20:33.536 --> 20:34.145
She's gone.

20:34.668 --> 20:35.886
She'll be back.

20:39.455 --> 20:41.196
No one knows
who Midnight is.

20:41.457 --> 20:42.719
What planet she's from.

20:43.677 --> 20:45.331
One day she just
appeared on Mars

20:45.374 --> 20:47.115
to fight alongside
the White Martians.

20:47.594 --> 20:49.900
-But why?
-Because she's fueled by death.

20:51.119 --> 20:53.861
And the White Martians
were quite happy to let her
loose on my people.

20:54.601 --> 20:55.950
How did you
defeat her?

20:56.777 --> 20:58.082
I can't remember.

20:58.126 --> 20:59.867
You're still recovering from
the psychic trauma

20:59.910 --> 21:01.477
you experienced
at the museum.

21:02.043 --> 21:03.087
It could affect your memory.

21:03.349 --> 21:04.872
This feels personal, J'onn.

21:04.915 --> 21:06.177
Manchester Black spent a year

21:06.221 --> 21:08.092
launching personal attacks
against me.

21:08.571 --> 21:10.530
If I can survive him,
I can survive anything.

21:10.573 --> 21:12.096
We still have to
find Midnight.

21:12.140 --> 21:13.968
And we don't know
who brought her here
or why.

21:14.011 --> 21:17.058
The good news is, a battle
like that must have
depleted her powers.

21:17.493 --> 21:19.147
I think we bought ourselves
up to 24 hours

21:19.190 --> 21:20.453
before she's able
to attack again.

21:20.496 --> 21:22.281
Well, good, I'll circle
the country

21:22.324 --> 21:23.717
and see if I can find her
while she's still weak.

21:24.021 --> 21:26.546
J'onn, can you shapeshift
and accept my award tonight?

21:26.589 --> 21:27.677
Oh, yes, please,

21:27.721 --> 21:29.288
it's great fun
to watch you do that.

21:29.331 --> 21:31.290
Kara, no.

21:31.333 --> 21:33.422
You are accepting
that award.

21:33.466 --> 21:35.250
And we're all gonna be
there to watch.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.078
We'll find Midnight,
and we're gonna face her

21:37.121 --> 21:39.428
the same exact way
that we face everything else.

21:40.124 --> 21:41.082
Together.

21:42.910 --> 21:45.434
This is nice,
you in my office.

21:45.478 --> 21:48.263
Well, I'm not so sure
if I actually have
an office anymore.

21:48.307 --> 21:51.353
Yeah, I ran into Kara
in the elevator,

21:51.397 --> 21:53.573
and I had to tell her
I couldn't join her crusade

21:53.616 --> 21:54.791
against my new boss

21:55.226 --> 21:57.403
on my second day.

21:57.446 --> 21:58.708
Yeah.

21:58.752 --> 22:00.580
I'll support whatever you guys
decide to do.

22:00.971 --> 22:03.365
Just mostly in the abstract.

22:03.409 --> 22:05.498
I'm just really proud
of the company

22:05.541 --> 22:07.064
that we built over
the last few years.

22:07.108 --> 22:10.764
It's a strong, serious,
hard-hitting news organization

22:10.807 --> 22:12.026
that actually
affects people's lives.

22:12.374 --> 22:14.942
Whatever this vision
Andrea has for CatCo,

22:15.334 --> 22:16.335
I don't recognize it.

22:16.813 --> 22:18.424
And I don't think
I can play that game.

22:18.815 --> 22:19.816
Then don't.

22:20.426 --> 22:21.688
What do you mean?

22:21.731 --> 22:23.820
CatCo and journalism
isn't all that you are.

22:24.821 --> 22:26.127
You started helping people

22:26.170 --> 22:28.390
long before Dad put that
camera in your hand.

22:29.173 --> 22:32.394
And look, I know that
you think that you have to

22:32.438 --> 22:34.483
muscle your way
through everything.

22:35.441 --> 22:39.488
But, for once,
just take a step back

22:39.532 --> 22:40.750
and ask...

22:42.709 --> 22:44.711
"What does James Olsen want?"

22:47.844 --> 22:49.498
-You wanted to see me?
-Kara.

22:49.977 --> 22:52.022
I believe you're familiar
with William Day.

22:53.328 --> 22:54.547
Yes. Yes.

22:54.590 --> 22:55.852
Uh, by reputation.

22:56.505 --> 22:57.898
I'm a big fan
of your work.

22:58.202 --> 23:00.857
Your expose
on eminent domain

23:00.901 --> 23:03.077
in Hart-el-pool,
it was brilliant.

23:03.512 --> 23:05.166
It's Hartlepool.

23:07.255 --> 23:08.474
I totally agree.

23:08.517 --> 23:10.127
Solar window treatments
are the way to go.

23:10.171 --> 23:13.261
Kara, I asked William
to take a look at
the few articles

23:13.304 --> 23:14.958
James said
we're ready to post.

23:15.394 --> 23:18.571
Your piece on
the governor's proposed
water tax

23:18.614 --> 23:20.529
is very thoroughly
researched.

23:20.573 --> 23:22.183
I asked William
to rewrite it.

23:23.793 --> 23:25.491
You buried the lede
in the fourth paragraph,

23:25.752 --> 23:28.407
obscured emotion
with unneeded facts
and back story.

23:28.711 --> 23:30.713
Overloaded it
with unnecessary detail.

23:32.889 --> 23:36.415
That story laid out
everything going on
with the issue.

23:36.980 --> 23:39.635
Cutting out facts,
not disclosing every side,

23:40.114 --> 23:42.029
that puts inherent bias
in the piece.

23:42.072 --> 23:44.161
Every story has inherent bias,
to some extent.

23:45.336 --> 23:46.512
I would think you

23:46.555 --> 23:48.122
of all people
would agree with me.

23:48.165 --> 23:51.212
Your reporting is comprehensive
and in-depth.

23:51.255 --> 23:52.822
When I wrote for The Times,

23:52.866 --> 23:54.476
I wrote stories the way
The Timeswanted them.

23:56.652 --> 23:58.915
Did the same for Le Monde,
in French no less.
The Mail,however,

23:59.568 --> 24:01.222
-I wrote tabloid stock.
- Kara,

24:01.483 --> 24:05.531
if you're having trouble
with the style I'm looking for,

24:05.574 --> 24:07.489
William can always
rewrite you.

24:07.533 --> 24:09.709
-I don't mind, as long
as I get a shared byline.
-Of course.

24:13.452 --> 24:16.542
You can't just take over
a storied news outlet

24:16.585 --> 24:19.283
and turn it into
a pandering clickbait tabloid.

24:19.762 --> 24:21.068
Actually, I can...

24:21.111 --> 24:22.809
And here's where you
threaten me if I quit,

24:22.852 --> 24:25.115
-you'll block me
from the whole profession.
-Correct.

24:25.159 --> 24:26.465
-Mmm-hmm.
-And I'm not gonna fire you.

24:26.856 --> 24:28.597
Well, I'm not leaving
journalism,

24:28.641 --> 24:30.730
so if I stay here,
you should get used
to the fact

24:30.773 --> 24:32.558
that I will be reporting
what I want

24:32.601 --> 24:34.168
and writing it
the way I want to.

24:34.211 --> 24:36.997
I will try to be shorter,
because I am flexible.

24:37.476 --> 24:38.825
But I will fight you

24:38.868 --> 24:41.262
every time on every story

24:41.305 --> 24:43.917
to make sure it is told
the way it deserves to be told.

24:43.960 --> 24:46.267
I will not tolerate
being rewritten by him,

24:46.310 --> 24:48.312
and I will not allow
my voice to be silenced.

24:49.226 --> 24:52.403
I never had any intention
of silencing you, Kara.

24:53.666 --> 24:55.929
-I'm glad we worked that out.
-Good for me.

24:57.234 --> 24:58.235
Good.

25:12.815 --> 25:14.730
And then I just went off
on Andrea.

25:14.774 --> 25:16.297
I told her how I really feel

25:16.340 --> 25:18.604
about her new vision
for CatCo,

25:18.647 --> 25:20.780
and I told her what
I will and will not tolerate,

25:20.823 --> 25:22.477
and I did it
all in front of the new guy.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.523
-Good for you.

25:25.001 --> 25:27.700
Yeah, I mean,
I can stand up in front
of my new boss,

25:27.743 --> 25:30.616
but with Lena, when it comes
to telling her the truth,

25:30.659 --> 25:31.965
I'm just frozen.

25:32.487 --> 25:33.793
Why can't I do it?

25:33.836 --> 25:35.969
Look, I know
I've been hard on you.

25:36.012 --> 25:39.929
But you know what?
Tonight, this is your night.

25:40.451 --> 25:45.369
So I am giving you permission
to stop beating yourself up

25:45.413 --> 25:47.110
and enjoy it, okay?

25:47.154 --> 25:48.895
You can worry about
telling Lena another time.

25:49.417 --> 25:50.636
I guess you're right.

25:50.940 --> 25:51.985
Smile.

25:52.681 --> 25:53.987
-Hey.
-Hi.

25:54.030 --> 25:56.163
-Hi.
-Congratulations, Kara.

25:56.206 --> 25:58.992
-Thank you.
-Do you mind if I steal
your sister away for a dance?

25:59.035 --> 26:00.863
No, of course.
She loves dancing.

26:00.907 --> 26:03.562
-I am terrible.
-Excuse me.

26:04.258 --> 26:06.216
Kara, I brought you a gift

26:06.260 --> 26:08.654
to celebrate
this momentous occasion.

26:08.697 --> 26:10.351
Oh, Brainy,
that is so sweet of you.

26:10.394 --> 26:11.918
You didn't have to do that.

26:11.961 --> 26:12.875
I'm so excited.

26:12.919 --> 26:14.224
Behold.

26:15.399 --> 26:18.011
It's a microscopic
motion activator.

26:18.054 --> 26:19.360
Oh, did you forget it?

26:19.403 --> 26:22.842
It is simply too small
to be perceived,

26:22.885 --> 26:24.104
but don't be fooled,

26:24.147 --> 26:27.977
for this miniscule device
contains multitudes.

26:28.891 --> 26:31.590
More specifically,
your new super suit.

26:31.633 --> 26:34.114
Brainy, I thought you were
just fixing my cape.

26:34.157 --> 26:35.898
Well, give an artist
a canvas,

26:37.291 --> 26:38.466
if you'll allow me.

26:38.509 --> 26:40.816
Well, um, can I...
Don't break them.

26:43.471 --> 26:45.865
Now, please take care

26:45.908 --> 26:47.736
when removing
your glasses in public,

26:47.780 --> 26:50.043
for the next time
you whip those off,

26:50.434 --> 26:52.436
your new suit
will materialize.

26:52.872 --> 26:54.656
Or dematerialize,
as needed.

27:13.414 --> 27:14.633
Lena.

27:15.677 --> 27:16.896
What are you doing
back here?

27:17.766 --> 27:18.941
Okay, you caught me.

27:19.333 --> 27:20.900
It was supposed
to be a surprise,

27:20.943 --> 27:22.249
but I'm the one
who's gonna introduce you.

27:23.119 --> 27:24.425
I couldn't miss
an opportunity

27:24.468 --> 27:26.079
to tell the world
how wonderful you are.

27:26.122 --> 27:27.733
No, no, I...

27:28.124 --> 27:30.039
Lena, I can't let you do this,

27:30.083 --> 27:32.215
-I don't deserve it.
-Are you kidding me?

27:32.694 --> 27:34.914
Me more than anyone knows
how much you deserve it.

27:35.305 --> 27:37.960
I saw how you risked
your life to expose
Lex's crimes.

27:38.004 --> 27:39.266
I'm Supergirl.

27:53.672 --> 27:55.282
I've always been Supergirl.

27:58.154 --> 28:00.635
I should've told you
so long ago, I know that.

28:01.244 --> 28:02.811
But I just kept making excuses

28:02.855 --> 28:04.726
because you've been hurt
so many times

28:04.770 --> 28:05.771
and...

28:07.076 --> 28:10.210
I convinced myself
that I was protecting you.

28:12.168 --> 28:14.823
And then one day,
you were so angry with me,

28:14.867 --> 28:16.477
with Supergirl.

28:17.347 --> 28:18.697
But you still loved Kara.

28:20.568 --> 28:22.048
I just kept thinking...

28:23.005 --> 28:25.616
if I could be Kara,
just Kara...

28:27.227 --> 28:29.359
that I could keep you
as a friend.

28:32.014 --> 28:34.887
I was selfish
and scared,

28:35.539 --> 28:37.280
and I didn't wanna lose you,

28:38.717 --> 28:40.196
so I kept pretending,

28:41.850 --> 28:43.330
and I never stopped.

28:46.899 --> 28:48.988
Every time I kept my secret
from you, I wasn't...

28:49.510 --> 28:51.468
protecting you,
I was hurting you,

28:51.512 --> 28:55.690
just like everyone else,
and I am so, so sorry.

28:58.040 --> 28:59.781
I am so sorry.

29:05.047 --> 29:06.440
Please say something.

29:08.572 --> 29:10.444
Ms. Luthor, you're on
in two minutes.

29:12.228 --> 29:13.273
Lena...

29:29.463 --> 29:30.769
Okay.

29:41.562 --> 29:44.130
Ms. Luthor,
it's almost 9:00 p.m.

29:44.521 --> 29:47.263
Should I upload
the file to CatCo's servers?

29:59.058 --> 30:00.363
Ms. Luthor?

30:02.757 --> 30:04.454
The world is full of liars.

30:06.587 --> 30:07.893
People who hide things
from us.

30:08.807 --> 30:11.331
People who manipulate
and control us.

30:11.810 --> 30:12.811
I should know.

30:13.637 --> 30:15.074
Some of the best liars
in the world

30:15.117 --> 30:15.901
are members of
my own family.

30:16.727 --> 30:17.946
But in my life,

30:18.817 --> 30:20.470
there was someone
who always reminded me

30:20.514 --> 30:21.863
that truth was
the better way.

30:23.517 --> 30:25.780
And she is the person
we are here tonight
to celebrate.

30:26.781 --> 30:28.000
Kara Danvers.

30:33.309 --> 30:34.397
The truth isn't easy.

30:34.789 --> 30:36.486
It's certainly not
for the faint of heart.

30:36.965 --> 30:39.359
But it is something
that Kara, as a journalist,

30:39.838 --> 30:42.101
has pursued relentlessly
every day.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.973
And because she's
so good at it,

30:45.800 --> 30:47.106
she makes it look easy.

30:48.150 --> 30:50.109
We sometimes forget
that she's just like us.

30:51.937 --> 30:54.113
But forging a path to the truth

30:54.461 --> 30:55.854
isn't a piece of cake.

30:57.159 --> 30:58.421
It's more like
climbing a mountain.

30:59.988 --> 31:01.555
It's arduous
and painful at times,

31:01.598 --> 31:02.861
and, just like us,

31:03.992 --> 31:05.602
Kara can sometimes slip.

31:07.343 --> 31:09.215
But she always
gets back up

31:09.258 --> 31:10.869
and pulls through
in the end.

31:13.219 --> 31:15.351
And we're always
better for her efforts.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.920
So, thank you, Kara,
for reminding us

31:18.964 --> 31:20.617
that the truth
is important.

31:21.183 --> 31:23.359
Even when it's not
always easy to accept.

31:29.409 --> 31:31.715
Agent Dox,
we have an update.

31:34.240 --> 31:35.589
Kara.

31:36.068 --> 31:38.026
You will always
be my best friend.

31:39.549 --> 31:41.725
I just received
an alert from the DEO.

31:42.030 --> 31:44.293
Midnight is fully charged
and on the move.

31:44.728 --> 31:46.295
-Where is she?
- Here.

31:57.480 --> 31:59.569
J'onn, lead her
away from the civilians.

31:59.613 --> 32:00.657
We'll follow.

32:08.752 --> 32:10.015
I guess
that's your cue.

32:10.276 --> 32:11.146
Supergirl.

32:32.080 --> 32:33.386
Pants.

32:48.923 --> 32:51.186
How do you guys
change so fast?

33:09.813 --> 33:11.119
Well, that's not great.

33:28.571 --> 33:29.833
What is she doing?

33:30.138 --> 33:31.792
She's creating
a black hole.

33:31.835 --> 33:34.360
Brainy, if I solar flare,

33:34.838 --> 33:36.449
can I shut that down?

33:36.492 --> 33:38.494
Gravitational power
comes from the core.

33:39.017 --> 33:41.323
We'd have to go inside
the void to do that.

33:42.063 --> 33:43.804
But why do things the hard way?

33:43.847 --> 33:44.761
J'onn.

33:56.077 --> 33:57.078
J'onn!

34:06.174 --> 34:07.915
Guess we're doing things
the hard way.

34:07.958 --> 34:10.396
No, no, no, you cannot
rescue J'onn from
the event horizon

34:10.438 --> 34:11.831
and destroy the void.

34:11.875 --> 34:13.485
The odds are--

34:13.529 --> 34:15.270
We can't let bad odds
or whatever it is
we're afraid of

34:15.313 --> 34:17.272
stop us from doing
what we know is right.

34:27.717 --> 34:29.154
Supergirl, no.

34:29.458 --> 34:31.504
We shouldn't both
die in here.

34:31.547 --> 34:32.809
We won't.

34:52.655 --> 34:54.657
See?

34:55.092 --> 34:56.050
Piece of cake.

35:11.239 --> 35:13.328
And you're sure
the server didn't go down?

35:13.589 --> 35:16.940
Because I was waiting on
a file that didn't come in.

35:17.593 --> 35:18.986
Well, check it again.

35:21.597 --> 35:23.121
Thought you were
supposed to be the tech expert.

35:24.426 --> 35:25.427
There you are.

35:26.472 --> 35:27.560
You were at the party

35:27.603 --> 35:29.649
when that big, weird hole
opened, no?

35:31.129 --> 35:32.521
Where are the photos?

35:32.565 --> 35:34.915
I believe Dardine
at extension 506
has what you need.

35:35.829 --> 35:36.743
I got nothing.

35:37.831 --> 35:39.354
Now, I can go into
a whole diatribe

35:39.398 --> 35:41.878
about why that is,
but I know you like
to keep things

35:41.922 --> 35:43.228
short and sweet, so...

35:44.664 --> 35:45.621
I quit.

35:47.449 --> 35:48.407
Are you sure
about that?

35:48.450 --> 35:49.582
Mmm-hmm.

35:49.625 --> 35:51.671
You'll never work
as a journalist again.

35:53.281 --> 35:54.804
That's part of
the adventure.

35:58.025 --> 35:59.896
Okay, no, Kelly,

35:59.940 --> 36:02.421
-you need to settle something
for us once and for all.
- Mmm.

36:02.464 --> 36:04.684
Who is the greatest
movie villain of all time?

36:04.727 --> 36:06.381
Oh, that's easy.

36:06.425 --> 36:07.687
Hans Gruber.

36:08.644 --> 36:10.298
-Oh, my heart.
-What...

36:11.995 --> 36:13.301
Yes. Told you.

36:13.345 --> 36:14.781
-Mmm.

36:14.824 --> 36:15.912
-Bye, guys.
-Bye.

36:15.956 --> 36:17.175
See you tomorrow.

36:20.482 --> 36:21.614
Uh...

36:22.049 --> 36:23.050
Okay.

36:24.312 --> 36:27.185
We need to
talk about this.

36:32.973 --> 36:36.281
We've been together
or something like together

36:36.324 --> 36:37.804
for almost a month.

36:38.152 --> 36:39.893
-Almost.
-And...

36:40.502 --> 36:43.810
we still never get past
a firm handshake.

36:45.203 --> 36:46.160
I...

36:47.596 --> 36:48.554
I just need to know
what you're comfortable with.

36:50.077 --> 36:53.689
Because I get the feeling
that maybe you haven't...

36:54.212 --> 36:55.430
done this before.

36:55.735 --> 36:57.954
Which is fine
if you haven't,

36:57.998 --> 36:59.739
-I totally understand that...
-You thought that...

37:00.348 --> 37:02.132
-Are you?
-No.

37:02.481 --> 37:05.527
-Oh.
-I've had plenty of
romantic experience.

37:05.571 --> 37:08.487
-I mean, a lot, actually.
-Oh, okay.

37:08.878 --> 37:09.749
Truth is...

37:11.620 --> 37:15.972
you are the first person
I have ever loved.

37:17.887 --> 37:19.324
-Brainy.
-You want to know why

37:19.367 --> 37:21.717
I find Miranda Priestly
so terrifying?

37:22.240 --> 37:23.589
It's because she's cold,

37:24.111 --> 37:25.243
she's uncaring,

37:26.635 --> 37:28.246
she betrays the people
she cares about the most.

37:30.030 --> 37:31.901
And last month
at Lex Luthor's camp,

37:33.294 --> 37:36.254
that is exactly how
I behaved toward you.

37:36.558 --> 37:38.560
-Brainy.
-Even though I love you,

37:38.604 --> 37:39.909
I hurt you.

37:40.562 --> 37:43.522
If I've kept my distance,
it's because I find myself

37:43.565 --> 37:46.307
wondering how could
I ever let my guard down

37:46.351 --> 37:48.657
-with you again, I...
-Querl Dox,

37:48.918 --> 37:50.703
I know you.

37:52.879 --> 37:55.316
That person who left me
at the camp wasn't you.

37:56.535 --> 37:59.277
You are caring,

37:59.625 --> 38:01.322
and selfless,

38:02.323 --> 38:03.585
and good.

38:07.241 --> 38:09.939
I want to be the person
you let your guard down with.

38:11.463 --> 38:13.465
I want you to be able to...

38:13.813 --> 38:15.423
fully be yourself with me.

38:17.120 --> 38:18.339
Do you want that too?

38:19.862 --> 38:21.211
More than anything.

38:23.431 --> 38:24.780
Then kiss me?

38:43.930 --> 38:44.800
Uh...

38:45.845 --> 38:46.846
Are you lost?

38:50.415 --> 38:52.547
No, J'onn J'onzz.

38:52.591 --> 38:54.332
I'm exactly
where I should be.

39:00.642 --> 39:02.731
You're the shapeshifter
that released Midnight.

39:03.645 --> 39:04.646
What do you want from me?

39:04.690 --> 39:07.127
To be punished
for your crimes.

39:07.170 --> 39:09.782
You may have defeated
Midnight, but I'll make sure

39:09.825 --> 39:11.610
you get what you deserve.

39:11.653 --> 39:13.133
Why? Who are you?

39:13.176 --> 39:16.136
Don't pretend
you don't recognize me.

39:17.050 --> 39:18.181
Brother.

39:22.795 --> 39:23.839
I have no brother.

39:23.883 --> 39:25.188
Lies.

39:25.232 --> 39:27.669
You and Father are more evil
than even I knew,

39:28.191 --> 39:30.193
but justice will prevail.

39:30.237 --> 39:32.631
I will do to you
as you did to me.

39:33.109 --> 39:34.372
You say you're
my brother...

39:36.199 --> 39:37.070
Prove it!

39:57.525 --> 40:00.746
Lena, I can't tell you
how much it means to me

40:00.789 --> 40:02.095
that you were there tonight,

40:02.138 --> 40:04.489
that you're even willing
to talk to me at all.

40:05.228 --> 40:07.666
Thank you for telling me
the truth,

40:07.709 --> 40:08.580
but, Kara,

40:09.842 --> 40:11.713
things can't be like
they were before.

40:12.497 --> 40:15.674
Do you understand?
There can be no more
secrets between us,

40:15.717 --> 40:17.415
-I have to be in
on everything.
-You will be.

40:18.851 --> 40:20.418
That's actually
why I'm here.

40:22.332 --> 40:23.290
You know everything now.

40:33.605 --> 40:34.693
And if you ever need me,

40:35.737 --> 40:36.912
all you have to do is call.

40:49.534 --> 40:51.100
The file
was ready to upload.

40:51.361 --> 40:52.711
Why didn't you send it,

40:52.754 --> 40:55.409
exposing Supergirl's
identity to the world?

40:55.453 --> 40:57.280
Did you forgive
Kara Danvers?

40:57.324 --> 40:58.456
She betrayed me.

40:59.935 --> 41:01.154
It broke my heart.

41:02.851 --> 41:04.287
I could never forgive her.

41:04.331 --> 41:06.246
- Then I don't
understand.
-How could you?

41:06.289 --> 41:07.465
You're not a Luthor.

41:07.856 --> 41:09.162
We're scorpions.

41:09.554 --> 41:11.077
When someone betrays us,
we sting.

41:13.035 --> 41:14.472
But I have a calling, Hope,

41:14.733 --> 41:16.430
and it's to fix mankind.

41:17.039 --> 41:19.389
I never thought Supergirl
would tell me who she was,

41:19.433 --> 41:22.044
but now that she has,
I have an opportunity,

41:22.480 --> 41:24.656
and I can use Supergirl
to achieve my ends.

41:24.960 --> 41:27.963
That is easier to do
if she believes
there is trust.

41:31.097 --> 41:32.359
Load the simulation.

41:32.794 --> 41:34.317
Yes, Ms. Luthor.

41:37.495 --> 41:38.583
Good night.
