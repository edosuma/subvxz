WEBVTT

00:01.349 --> 00:03.003
Previously onHalo.

00:03.046 --> 00:04.700
The Covenant
flew off with the artifact,

00:04.743 --> 00:06.049
and then you drop
from the sky,

00:06.093 --> 00:08.225
offering to help us
get it back.

00:08.269 --> 00:09.748
Tell me why
I should trust you.

00:09.792 --> 00:11.185
Because I'm like you.

00:11.228 --> 00:12.925
John, you have some connection

00:12.969 --> 00:15.102
to this thing that
we're calling the Halo.

00:15.145 --> 00:17.365
I know that you will
take us there, and when you do,

00:17.408 --> 00:21.195
we will lead our species
beyond its current limitations.

00:21.238 --> 00:22.631
But you need me to do this.

00:22.674 --> 00:23.762
You admitted everything

00:23.806 --> 00:25.416
to the Master Chief.

00:25.460 --> 00:27.810
Your clearances are revoked,
effectively immediately.

00:27.853 --> 00:29.725
The stewardship
of the Spartan program

00:29.768 --> 00:32.075
moves to a more
responsible person.

00:32.119 --> 00:33.642
We got a transmission.

00:33.685 --> 00:35.252
It was a voice
speaking in Sangheili.

00:35.296 --> 00:36.819
We're working to clean it up.

00:36.862 --> 00:39.517
Maybe you could
verify my translation?

00:39.561 --> 00:42.042
It was never my intention
to hurt you.

00:45.784 --> 00:47.612
I could show you, John.

00:47.656 --> 00:51.399
Take me to the keystone.
It will lead us to its partner.

00:51.442 --> 00:53.662
If she could use the artifact
to find the other one,

00:53.705 --> 00:55.794
maybe I can too.

00:55.838 --> 00:58.536
The Covenant
call me "The Blessed One."

01:00.103 --> 01:01.713
We are the same.

02:38.114 --> 02:39.463
Don't be afraid.

04:06.028 --> 04:09.118
From the moment
I first saw him as a child,

04:09.161 --> 04:11.555
I had an instinct.

04:11.599 --> 04:13.557
He wasn't the fastest
or the strongest,

04:13.601 --> 04:17.082
but there was
something about him.

04:17.126 --> 04:20.303
And now there may be
two of them.

04:20.347 --> 04:23.654
Look, his health seems
to be improving.

04:25.134 --> 04:26.527
That's right.

04:26.570 --> 04:28.180
All his systems
are back to normal.

04:28.224 --> 04:29.660
Look at you, so cheerful.

04:29.704 --> 04:31.314
Chief's health
is important to me.

04:31.358 --> 04:34.099
There's two of us
inside his head now, remember?

04:36.798 --> 04:38.060
Cortana...

04:39.540 --> 04:41.411
do you think he trusts her?

04:41.455 --> 04:43.718
He's not speaking with me
at the moment,

04:43.761 --> 04:45.328
but if I had to guess,

04:45.372 --> 04:47.374
Master Chief doesn't trust
anyone right now.

04:47.417 --> 04:49.289
I'll bet.

04:49.332 --> 04:52.074
Doctor, we can't do anything
without John,

04:52.117 --> 04:54.946
and he has turned
his back on us.

04:54.990 --> 04:58.689
I think he's discovering
what I've always suspected:

04:58.733 --> 05:03.738
that he is connected
to something beyond all of us.

05:17.621 --> 05:19.971
"And they ran among
the broad Margolia trees,

05:20.015 --> 05:21.886
and the sun danced
on the leaves."

05:23.192 --> 05:24.324
What's that?

05:25.934 --> 05:27.501
It's from a book
a friend used to read to me

05:27.544 --> 05:29.633
when I was very young.

05:29.677 --> 05:31.809
He said there were
places like this,

05:31.853 --> 05:34.029
with trees and bright light
in the sky.

05:37.249 --> 05:38.816
Green grass to walk on.

06:22.991 --> 06:24.384
Let's walk.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.434
Look at him!

06:31.478 --> 06:33.044
Frolicking in the park!

06:35.307 --> 06:37.701
The 1-1-7 I knew
would have torn her apart

06:37.745 --> 06:39.355
one limb at a time

06:39.399 --> 06:41.357
until he got the answers
he required.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.446
He has changed, Jacob.

06:44.708 --> 06:46.231
Yeah.

06:51.672 --> 06:53.978
You don't think
he suspects us?

06:55.110 --> 06:57.808
He knows Halsey
answered to me.

06:57.852 --> 07:00.376
If he finds out we were involved
in his abduction--

07:00.420 --> 07:03.118
If he did,
we'd know about it.

07:03.161 --> 07:05.642
Believe me,
that's all behind us now.

07:08.036 --> 07:11.996
This is dirty business,
all of it.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.911
We have to trust him,
Margaret.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.524
Master Chief is a soldier.

07:17.567 --> 07:19.264
He's always on mission.

07:29.666 --> 07:30.841
I saw you...

07:32.539 --> 07:33.888
on the ring.

07:35.237 --> 07:37.021
I saw you too.
How did you do that?

07:37.065 --> 07:38.675
I don't know. I just, I...

07:40.285 --> 07:41.461
I let go.

07:43.506 --> 07:45.726
-That's incredible.
-So, that's it.

07:47.118 --> 07:49.643
That's the--
that's the Halo.

07:49.686 --> 07:51.906
I'm sure of it.

07:51.949 --> 07:54.517
I felt a connection to it
my entire life.

07:54.561 --> 07:57.520
It's like a yearning
for home.

07:57.564 --> 07:59.304
You brought us there.

07:59.348 --> 08:01.263
What is it, Makee?

08:01.306 --> 08:03.352
And why do the Covenant
want it so bad?

08:06.921 --> 08:08.096
There's a prophecy.

08:09.619 --> 08:11.882
"Where the stars
sparkle like glass,

08:11.926 --> 08:14.102
"a divine wind
will rush through,

08:14.145 --> 08:16.321
"propelling all of those
who are worthy

08:16.365 --> 08:18.410
on a great journey
to the sacred ring,

08:18.454 --> 08:20.848
where we will become like gods."

08:22.676 --> 08:23.894
And those who aren't worthy?

08:27.942 --> 08:29.117
Cleansed.

08:36.733 --> 08:38.082
And you believe that?

08:40.955 --> 08:42.696
Humans are unworthy?

08:44.654 --> 08:46.482
From what I saw,
humans didn't seem

08:46.526 --> 08:48.310
to be worthy of anything.

08:53.576 --> 08:55.709
I've only seen fragments
from my childhood.

08:58.625 --> 09:01.541
But what I saw,
what I felt...

09:03.499 --> 09:04.631
was goodness.

09:06.850 --> 09:10.462
I saw a capacity for hope.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.508
Love.

09:14.205 --> 09:15.990
There is something
within us.

09:18.035 --> 09:21.299
Something special in humans.
Something sacred.

09:22.910 --> 09:24.346
Something worth protecting.

09:27.871 --> 09:29.264
Master Chief!

09:31.745 --> 09:32.920
Chief!

09:35.096 --> 09:36.488
I'll be back.

09:45.062 --> 09:46.629
Apologies,
Master Chief,

09:46.673 --> 09:48.588
but we have a situation
on Criterion.

09:50.938 --> 09:53.505
Sorry,
he just likes people.

09:54.942 --> 09:57.727
Come on. That's it.

10:06.562 --> 10:09.696
Orbital defenses
were wiped out immediately.

10:09.739 --> 10:11.523
Then three more Covenant fleets

10:11.567 --> 10:15.310
appeared in formation
above the equatorial zone.

10:15.353 --> 10:17.704
Telmun fell first.

10:17.747 --> 10:20.010
This is-- or was--

10:20.054 --> 10:22.186
the city of Agade.

10:22.230 --> 10:25.320
An hour ago, 11 million people
were living here,

10:25.363 --> 10:28.584
including my family.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.673
God rest their souls.

10:32.283 --> 10:34.503
The search for survivors
has begun.

10:34.546 --> 10:35.896
Cut the feed.

10:35.939 --> 10:37.680
...even know
where to start.

10:37.724 --> 10:39.334
Cut it!

10:39.377 --> 10:41.379
...medical technicians
are overwhelmed...

10:41.423 --> 10:43.077
Yes, sir.

10:43.120 --> 10:45.079
Contact Admiral Whitcomb.

10:45.122 --> 10:47.211
Task Seventh Fleet
to Criterion.

10:47.255 --> 10:49.170
Admiral, you know
I cannot do that.

10:49.213 --> 10:50.650
There are survivors!

10:50.693 --> 10:52.652
Criterion's gone.

10:52.695 --> 10:55.698
The Cole Protocol
applies here.

10:55.742 --> 10:57.700
We can't just sit here

10:57.744 --> 10:59.049
and wait for them to find us.

10:59.093 --> 11:01.138
The Admiral's right.

11:01.182 --> 11:04.054
We need to take
the fight to them.

11:04.098 --> 11:07.362
And how do you suggest
we find them, Master Chief?

11:07.405 --> 11:10.234
I mean, I got 150 techs
working around the clock,

11:10.278 --> 11:11.714
chasing down your lead,

11:11.758 --> 11:14.151
and we've found
absolutely nothing.

11:14.195 --> 11:16.066
Makee can show us
where they are,

11:16.110 --> 11:19.679
and where they took
the second artifact, using ours.

11:19.722 --> 11:21.463
Absolutely not.

11:21.506 --> 11:23.987
Why her? Why can't you do it?

11:24.031 --> 11:25.728
She's been trained
to communicate through them

11:25.772 --> 11:27.469
in a way that I still can't,
but she can help us.

11:27.512 --> 11:30.994
One stroll in the park
has you convinced?

11:32.822 --> 11:34.084
She was kidnapped
by the Covenant

11:34.128 --> 11:35.390
when she was a child.

11:35.433 --> 11:37.392
She was turned against us,

11:37.435 --> 11:41.613
but she is us,
Captain.

11:41.657 --> 11:43.180
She's human.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.662
Chief, people don't just
manually override

11:46.706 --> 11:48.969
decades of indoctrination.

11:49.012 --> 11:50.622
I did.

11:54.975 --> 11:58.326
Criterion and its people
have just been glassed,

11:58.369 --> 12:00.241
and now they're hunting us.

12:02.809 --> 12:04.593
Let Makee try.

12:11.948 --> 12:13.733
Miranda can supervise.

12:13.776 --> 12:15.822
First sign of trouble,
and she'll pull the plug.

12:19.434 --> 12:21.262
Get on with it.

12:37.495 --> 12:39.193
Still going?

12:39.236 --> 12:40.803
Eleven hours now.

12:40.847 --> 12:42.413
This thing can fly itself,

12:42.457 --> 12:44.764
but I can't find
any navigational data.

12:44.807 --> 12:46.417
The encryption
is extremely advanced.

12:48.245 --> 12:50.770
Those aliens are ugly,
not stupid.

12:53.685 --> 12:55.818
What's Kai's status?

12:55.862 --> 12:57.820
Getting there...

12:57.864 --> 12:59.169
I think.

12:59.213 --> 13:01.128
What does that mean?

13:01.171 --> 13:03.086
Is she fit for duty or not?

13:11.660 --> 13:13.140
Come on!

13:13.183 --> 13:14.532
Get some!

13:24.325 --> 13:25.935
Pay up!

13:25.979 --> 13:27.937
Give me the money!

13:29.025 --> 13:30.418
Damn, Spartan!

13:30.461 --> 13:32.115
Squidheads don't want
no part of that!

13:33.334 --> 13:34.944
What's next?

13:36.206 --> 13:38.121
You guys got anything heavy?

13:42.865 --> 13:45.694
Fuck yes! Come on!

13:45.737 --> 13:47.652
Go!

13:47.696 --> 13:49.306
Unreal!

13:49.350 --> 13:52.092
Ohh! Can you believe this?

14:12.721 --> 14:15.463
Captain Keyes. Access granted.

14:30.347 --> 14:31.740
Hey.

14:33.350 --> 14:34.525
Hey.

14:37.659 --> 14:39.530
Everything going
to schedule?

14:39.574 --> 14:42.011
Yeah, we've tasked satellites

14:42.055 --> 14:44.796
to track transmissions
to and from the artifact

14:44.840 --> 14:46.624
the second Makee makes contact.

14:46.668 --> 14:48.888
Should be ready
by noon tomorrow.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.586
Good.

14:51.629 --> 14:53.849
And what's this?

14:53.893 --> 14:56.069
It's the recording
from the Gladius

14:56.112 --> 14:57.940
after the Sangheili attack.

14:57.984 --> 14:59.942
It's still translating?

14:59.986 --> 15:01.770
Yeah, it's--

15:01.813 --> 15:03.641
it's the most bizarre thing.

15:03.685 --> 15:05.382
Even with voice approximation,

15:05.426 --> 15:09.996
I'm picking up some weird
variant on the dialect.

15:10.039 --> 15:11.127
Like an accent?

15:12.172 --> 15:14.043
Accent, maybe.

15:14.087 --> 15:15.479
Speech impediment.

15:17.220 --> 15:19.483
I don't know.
I've never seen it before.

15:19.527 --> 15:21.355
Can you show me?

15:22.530 --> 15:23.792
Okay, so I've--

15:23.835 --> 15:24.967
I've set the noise filters

15:25.011 --> 15:26.490
to standard Sangheili.

15:28.188 --> 15:31.060
But these frequencies
are all over the place.

15:31.104 --> 15:32.932
And then suddenly here it just--

15:32.975 --> 15:35.282
It drops down into a completely
different range.

15:35.325 --> 15:36.979
But then when I change
the algorithm down,

15:37.023 --> 15:38.938
I lose all of the high end.

15:40.200 --> 15:41.679
It's bizarre.

15:45.988 --> 15:47.337
If anyone can figure it out,

15:47.381 --> 15:48.382
it's you.

15:52.516 --> 15:53.996
See you at the test.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.432
See you
at the test.

16:37.213 --> 16:38.693
You two are relieved.

16:40.173 --> 16:42.262
Our orders are to stay
with the squidhead.

16:43.785 --> 16:45.526
You're relieved, Sergeant.

16:47.223 --> 16:48.572
Roger that.

17:02.108 --> 17:04.066
They're gonna let you use
our artifact

17:04.110 --> 17:06.590
to try to locate
the Covenant planet.

17:08.070 --> 17:09.506
Raas Kkhotskha?

17:09.550 --> 17:10.725
Hmm.

17:12.901 --> 17:14.729
So, they trust me?

17:14.772 --> 17:15.947
They trust me.

17:17.123 --> 17:18.820
And I trust you.

17:23.477 --> 17:24.652
What's that?

17:29.265 --> 17:30.832
I found it in the Archives.

17:32.486 --> 17:34.227
I know it's not
the same one.

17:37.012 --> 17:38.318
You're welcome to it.

17:42.539 --> 17:43.714
Or not.

17:47.892 --> 17:49.155
We have others.

17:59.426 --> 18:00.905
Thank you.

23:06.994 --> 23:08.909
John has a girlfriend.

23:10.563 --> 23:12.826
How ordinary.

23:12.869 --> 23:14.871
Their connection is deep.

23:14.915 --> 23:17.526
Their dopamine, serotonin,
and oxytocin levels

23:17.570 --> 23:19.485
are all elevated,

23:19.528 --> 23:21.835
all in biochemical
synchrony.

23:23.880 --> 23:26.622
John is no longer alone
in the galaxy.

23:26.666 --> 23:28.929
Well, John was never alone.

23:30.104 --> 23:31.235
He had me.

23:32.933 --> 23:34.151
Of course.

23:41.942 --> 23:44.074
What time's the test today,
Cortana?

23:44.118 --> 23:47.861
They're bringing Makee
to the artifact at 1200 hours.

23:47.904 --> 23:49.515
Okay.

23:49.558 --> 23:51.038
That's all for the moment.
Thank you.

23:55.564 --> 23:57.784
So, is there a problem?

23:57.827 --> 23:59.220
Why do you ask?

23:59.263 --> 24:01.048
I've been watching
contingency teams

24:01.091 --> 24:03.180
coming and going
from Fleetcom all night.

24:03.224 --> 24:05.748
Rooftop antennae
shifting positions.

24:05.792 --> 24:08.751
It's nothing you need
to concern yourself over.

24:08.795 --> 24:12.189
What, you've--
you've just come for a chat?

24:13.495 --> 24:15.715
Actually,
I came to say goodbye.

24:19.022 --> 24:23.462
Parangosky wants you
off the planet by noon today.

24:24.811 --> 24:26.595
High noon.

24:26.639 --> 24:29.119
Yeah, well, that's impossible.

24:29.163 --> 24:30.947
Why?

24:30.991 --> 24:34.168
Because I'm organizing
and collating my life's work.

24:34.211 --> 24:35.648
I suggest you prioritize.

24:35.691 --> 24:37.084
Grab what you need,

24:37.127 --> 24:39.129
and we'll send the rest
along after.

24:39.173 --> 24:42.089
But why is she so desperate
to get me off the planet?

24:42.132 --> 24:44.961
Well, Margaret knows
what a valuable asset

24:45.005 --> 24:46.789
you've been to the war effort,

24:46.833 --> 24:49.009
and the sooner you're up
and running in your new lab--

24:49.052 --> 24:50.532
Come on, you can do
better than that.

24:52.142 --> 24:55.624
I am still a valuable asset
right here.

24:55.668 --> 24:57.017
You tell me
what you're planning,

24:57.060 --> 24:59.106
and I can help you with it.

24:59.149 --> 25:02.370
You've become a liability,
Catherine.

25:03.632 --> 25:05.329
-Jacob.
-You're out.

25:13.599 --> 25:14.817
We had an agreement.

25:16.384 --> 25:17.864
You got to play
the good guy.

25:17.907 --> 25:19.387
I didn't play anything.

25:19.430 --> 25:21.389
Well, you were supposed
to have my back.

25:21.432 --> 25:23.304
You were supposed to have
my back. We had a deal.

25:23.347 --> 25:26.263
You think it's been easy for me,
carrying around your secrets?

25:26.307 --> 25:28.439
My sec-- our secrets!

25:28.483 --> 25:30.529
It is a little bit late
for your self-righteous anger.

25:30.572 --> 25:31.965
No, I am angry.

25:32.008 --> 25:34.445
I'm angry at you.
I'm angry at myself.

25:34.489 --> 25:36.665
I'm angry at this system

25:36.709 --> 25:38.754
that so easily
sacrifices human life

25:38.798 --> 25:41.104
in the name of progress,
or order,

25:41.148 --> 25:44.455
or whatever bullshit catchphrase
you come up with in the lab.

25:44.499 --> 25:46.327
But more importantly,

25:46.370 --> 25:49.156
I'm angry because you,
you just won't stop.

25:49.199 --> 25:51.419
How can I stop?

25:51.462 --> 25:53.290
-We are on the precipice...
-Oh, my God.

25:53.334 --> 25:54.901
-...of everything that--
-The future, right.

25:54.944 --> 25:58.252
This obsession that you have
with the future

25:58.295 --> 26:01.734
has cost you every relationship
that you have today.

26:02.865 --> 26:05.085
Me. John.

26:05.128 --> 26:06.652
Your only child.

26:08.915 --> 26:10.917
What else are you willing
to sacrifice?

26:10.960 --> 26:12.440
Everything.

26:14.137 --> 26:17.967
I am willing to sacrifice
absolutely everything.

26:29.849 --> 26:31.198
I pulled some strings...

26:33.026 --> 26:35.028
so that you could
keep your ship.

26:37.857 --> 26:40.076
It's fueled.
It's on the tarmac.

26:42.731 --> 26:44.428
You leave by noon.

26:54.177 --> 26:55.657
Is it finished?

26:55.701 --> 26:56.876
Only just.

27:01.141 --> 27:04.884
Iris, retinal, and vascular
matching complete.

27:04.927 --> 27:07.103
You now have
Category One clearance.

27:08.714 --> 27:09.758
Courtesy...

27:11.891 --> 27:12.805
of your daughter.

27:28.995 --> 27:31.562
Miranda Keyes. Access granted.

27:39.788 --> 27:41.572
Hello, Makee.

27:41.616 --> 27:43.357
Who are you?

27:43.400 --> 27:46.142
Apologies for hijacking
your entertainment system,

27:46.186 --> 27:48.971
but it's urgent
that I talk to you.

27:49.015 --> 27:50.799
-Guard?
-It's about John.

27:53.584 --> 27:55.238
How do you know John?

27:55.282 --> 27:58.198
You could say I know him
better than anyone.

27:58.241 --> 28:01.375
I raised him
since he was 6 years old.

28:01.418 --> 28:03.159
He's very fond of you,

28:03.203 --> 28:05.901
and I hear that you feel
the same way about him.

28:05.945 --> 28:07.816
Makes me very happy.

28:09.775 --> 28:11.298
What is it you want?

28:11.341 --> 28:13.996
John is in great danger.
In fact, you both are.

28:15.476 --> 28:16.999
What do you mean?

28:17.043 --> 28:21.221
The artifacts must never
be delivered to the UNSC.

28:21.264 --> 28:24.920
John believes they're safer
under human control.

28:24.964 --> 28:27.793
Well, you lived among us.
Would you agree?

28:29.969 --> 28:32.275
You don't care for humanity.

28:32.319 --> 28:35.148
I love humanity,

28:35.191 --> 28:37.411
but humans are the problem.

28:37.454 --> 28:38.934
We're stuck.

28:38.978 --> 28:41.502
We're still venal,
selfish creatures

28:41.545 --> 28:44.766
who create misery and pain
wherever we go.

28:46.202 --> 28:48.683
If the Halo is indeed a weapon,

28:48.727 --> 28:51.512
we will doubtless use it
to destroy ourselves

28:51.555 --> 28:52.992
once and for all.

28:53.035 --> 28:54.645
John won't let that happen.

28:54.689 --> 28:57.518
Makee, there is no John.

28:57.561 --> 28:58.911
There's been
no John for years.

28:58.954 --> 29:00.390
There is only Master Chief,

29:00.434 --> 29:03.959
a product of the species
who made him necessary.

29:04.003 --> 29:07.441
John has been used,
just as you have been used.

29:07.484 --> 29:10.923
But both of your gifts
are too precious

29:10.966 --> 29:12.620
for either side to claim.

29:12.663 --> 29:15.536
You two must be the ones
to control the Halo,

29:15.579 --> 29:16.929
with my help.

29:18.278 --> 29:20.149
Why are you telling me this?

29:21.585 --> 29:23.544
Why not tell John?

29:23.587 --> 29:27.113
You have a connection with John
that I will never have.

29:28.636 --> 29:30.769
It's been wonderful to watch.

29:30.812 --> 29:34.033
I'm so glad that you've
found each other.

29:34.076 --> 29:35.948
He will listen to you...

29:37.253 --> 29:38.515
but you must--

29:43.738 --> 29:45.174
What do you want?

29:45.218 --> 29:46.523
Who were you talking to?

30:06.892 --> 30:08.850
I know that they're planning
to use you

30:08.894 --> 30:10.547
to find the second artifact.

30:10.591 --> 30:13.246
You have to convince John

30:13.289 --> 30:15.248
to help you to remove
the artifact

30:15.291 --> 30:17.163
and bring it to me.

30:17.206 --> 30:19.643
I'll have a ship waiting
to take us away from here.

30:22.037 --> 30:23.691
And then what?

30:23.734 --> 30:27.477
Then we tap into
the intelligence of the Halo,

30:27.521 --> 30:29.871
and we unleash our full
and true potential

30:29.915 --> 30:31.220
as a species.

30:31.264 --> 30:32.874
Finally, we become--

30:32.918 --> 30:34.571
Like gods.

30:34.615 --> 30:35.529
What?

30:36.878 --> 30:38.575
I've heard enough.

30:38.619 --> 30:40.403
Makee, it is too dangerous
to leave the artifact--

30:40.447 --> 30:42.797
-How do I make it stop?
-Makee, listen, listen.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.451
-How do I make you go away?
-It is too dangerous...

30:44.494 --> 30:46.018
...to leave the arti...

30:53.068 --> 30:55.723
Of the human brain's
myriad design flaws,

30:55.766 --> 30:59.466
the hardest to overcome
is attachment.

31:00.597 --> 31:01.990
It makes us sentimental.

31:04.601 --> 31:08.954
People abandon all reason for
the sake of pride or fear or...

31:08.997 --> 31:09.911
Or love.

31:13.654 --> 31:15.308
Yes. Or love.

31:16.831 --> 31:18.920
That's why they need us,
Cortana.

31:18.964 --> 31:21.401
To save them from themselves.

31:22.793 --> 31:24.143
I hope we can deliver.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.715
Signal the Spartans.

31:57.437 --> 31:59.004
Spartans,

31:59.047 --> 32:00.875
the artifact you discovered
on Madrigal

32:00.919 --> 32:02.790
has adversely affected
senior leadership

32:02.833 --> 32:05.271
in the military
chain of command.

32:05.314 --> 32:07.969
No one of rank
can be considered

32:08.013 --> 32:10.276
trustworthy or reliable.

32:10.319 --> 32:12.234
As the senior civilian
representative,

32:12.278 --> 32:15.368
I am therefore
invoking Zed Protocol,

32:15.411 --> 32:17.979
effective immediately.

32:18.023 --> 32:21.765
I have activated the emergency
Spartan back channel.

32:21.809 --> 32:24.725
This is the only way
you'll receive new orders

32:24.768 --> 32:26.379
for your next mission.

32:26.422 --> 32:28.207
From this moment onwards,

32:28.250 --> 32:32.080
my orders shall supersede
all and any others.

32:32.124 --> 32:35.170
You've all been trained
for this eventuality,

32:35.214 --> 32:38.347
so I trust that you're ready
for the task at hand.

32:38.391 --> 32:39.958
-Copy.
-Copy.

32:40.001 --> 32:41.437
What about Master Chief?

32:41.481 --> 32:42.961
Why isn't he here?

32:43.004 --> 32:44.745
John is unwell.

32:44.788 --> 32:47.487
His repeated exposure
to the artifacts

32:47.530 --> 32:52.013
has impaired his cognition
and compromised his judgment.

32:52.057 --> 32:55.843
He can no longer be trusted
to stay on mission.

32:55.886 --> 33:00.021
Therefore, it is up to you
to save him.

33:00.065 --> 33:01.240
On my command,

33:01.283 --> 33:02.502
bring John, the prisoner,

33:02.545 --> 33:04.243
and the artifact to my ship,

33:04.286 --> 33:06.985
and we will
leave Reach together.

33:07.028 --> 33:08.508
John won't go without a fight.

33:10.814 --> 33:13.861
Cortana will take the fight
out of him.

33:13.904 --> 33:17.082
At the appropriate moment,
she can put him into stasis.

33:22.261 --> 33:23.697
Ma'am, are you sure

33:23.740 --> 33:25.481
this is the right
plan of action?

33:25.525 --> 33:28.267
There must be another way
to help Master Chief.

33:28.310 --> 33:30.747
I wish there were, Kai.

33:32.097 --> 33:34.142
But this is the only way.

33:39.104 --> 33:41.149
Good luck, Spartans.

33:43.586 --> 33:45.197
Guys, we can't do this.

33:45.240 --> 33:47.155
You know we can't do this.

33:49.984 --> 33:52.378
Riz, Vannak...

33:53.596 --> 33:55.076
listen carefully.

33:55.120 --> 33:56.556
This is John
we're talking about.

33:56.599 --> 33:58.297
There's no way
he was compromised.

33:58.340 --> 33:59.950
There's so much you don't know
about Halsey.

33:59.994 --> 34:01.517
-We need to find--

34:08.655 --> 34:10.483
It's just Riz and Vannak now.

34:10.526 --> 34:12.180
That should be enough.

34:12.224 --> 34:14.922
Could you give me access
to all cameras in Sector D?

34:14.965 --> 34:16.097
Yes.

34:18.882 --> 34:20.406
Doctor, may I ask,

34:20.449 --> 34:22.930
what do you intend to do
with Master Chief?

34:22.973 --> 34:24.758
Once we have Makee,

34:24.801 --> 34:27.543
we'll no longer need John
to activate the artifacts,

34:27.587 --> 34:30.198
which means you'll be free
to assume full control

34:30.242 --> 34:33.419
of his body and consciousness,
just as I promised.

34:33.462 --> 34:35.551
I see.

34:37.031 --> 34:38.380
Well, that's what you wanted.

34:38.424 --> 34:41.122
Where's that patented
enthusiasm?

34:41.166 --> 34:42.950
Forgive me, Doctor.

34:42.993 --> 34:47.694
As you said, sentimentality
is a weakness I do not possess.

34:47.737 --> 34:52.829
Ah, but in this case,
enthusiasm is warranted.

34:52.873 --> 34:55.136
This is a big day, Cortana.

34:55.180 --> 34:57.791
You and John combined...

34:59.227 --> 35:02.274
you will be the best
of all of us.

35:05.973 --> 35:07.844
Congratulations.

35:16.940 --> 35:18.551
Ready?

35:20.118 --> 35:21.293
Let's go.

35:27.212 --> 35:29.214
Master Chief is escorting Makee
to the secure room.

35:29.257 --> 35:30.563
Be right there.

35:33.870 --> 35:36.482
Admiral Parangosky and
Captain Keyes are also en route.

35:49.538 --> 35:51.323
Okay, they're on their way.

35:51.366 --> 35:52.759
Copy that.

35:52.802 --> 35:54.152
Kill the internal comms
on the base,

35:54.195 --> 35:55.849
but keep my line
to the Spartans open.

35:55.892 --> 35:57.024
Done.

36:19.916 --> 36:21.179
What is it?

36:23.398 --> 36:25.618
The hope for humanity.

36:29.187 --> 36:31.798
Or the end of everything.

36:36.498 --> 36:38.239
John.

36:38.283 --> 36:39.675
Hmm?

36:39.719 --> 36:41.634
What will we do
when we find the Halo?

36:43.113 --> 36:44.550
Destroy the Covenant.

36:46.291 --> 36:47.857
End the war.

36:50.643 --> 36:52.210
And then what?

36:53.298 --> 36:54.429
What do you mean?

36:56.953 --> 36:58.607
I mean...

36:58.651 --> 37:00.609
after you've beaten
the Covenant.

37:01.958 --> 37:03.525
What happens with the Halo?

37:09.270 --> 37:10.967
I guess we'll see.

37:14.623 --> 37:17.278
Riz, Vannak, they're on your
level, now headed towards you.

37:19.628 --> 37:20.586
Copy.

37:22.196 --> 37:23.241
Doctor, it's time--

37:23.284 --> 37:25.547
Just stop talking, please.

37:36.210 --> 37:37.951
Oh, my God, it's her.

37:40.475 --> 37:42.782
This is Dr. Keyes, I need
to speak to Captain Keyes.

37:43.870 --> 37:45.088
Do you have comms?

37:45.132 --> 37:46.612
No.

37:46.655 --> 37:49.745
I want that voice
crystal clear, okay?

37:49.789 --> 37:50.877
Yes, Doctor.

37:58.711 --> 38:01.757
Cortana, on my signal,
drop him.

38:03.629 --> 38:04.891
Thirty meters.

38:06.153 --> 38:07.328
Get ready.

38:07.372 --> 38:09.156
-John.
-Chief?

38:09.199 --> 38:11.027
-Not now.
-What?

38:11.071 --> 38:12.594
I know you don't want
to talk to me,

38:12.638 --> 38:14.596
-but it's important--
-Go away.

38:14.640 --> 38:16.685
-Who are you talking to?
-Chief, listen to me--

38:16.729 --> 38:17.991
No one.

38:18.034 --> 38:20.123
Twenty meters.

38:22.256 --> 38:24.127
Stop!

38:30.090 --> 38:31.831
Why'd they stop?
What's the problem?

38:31.874 --> 38:33.963
Halsey initiated
the Zed Protocol.

38:34.007 --> 38:35.661
-John...
-You're walking into a trap.

38:35.704 --> 38:36.923
...what's happening?

38:36.966 --> 38:38.490
Turn around and get out, now.

38:42.494 --> 38:44.496
-Adun!
-I-I've lost everything.

38:46.019 --> 38:47.194
Cortana!

38:48.891 --> 38:51.154
-I've lost Halsey.
-We've been compromised.

38:52.852 --> 38:55.028
I knew she would do
something like this!

38:55.071 --> 38:58.031
I said she would end up
doing something like this!

39:01.426 --> 39:03.210
"No sentiment."

39:06.082 --> 39:07.736
You need to leave.
Look for a Marine.

39:07.780 --> 39:09.477
Stay with them.
I'll find you.

39:09.521 --> 39:11.392
-No, I want to stay with you.
-I need you to leave! Go!

39:13.655 --> 39:15.309
Dr. Keyes,
what's your twenty?

39:18.617 --> 39:19.879
Miranda?

39:35.111 --> 39:36.374
Come on!

39:47.123 --> 39:48.473
All right.

39:50.562 --> 39:51.998
Let's talk.

39:59.658 --> 40:01.442
Vannak, don't do this!

40:09.537 --> 40:12.932
Whatever she told you,
it's not true.

40:21.680 --> 40:23.508
You're not well, Chief.

40:23.551 --> 40:26.511
Don't make this
harder on yourself.

40:26.554 --> 40:28.164
We're on the same side--

40:32.430 --> 40:34.649
-Hand me your radio.
-Sir.

40:39.524 --> 40:41.743
-Comms are down?
-Sergeant Malya...

40:41.787 --> 40:44.267
find Master Chief and the girl
and bring them here.

40:44.311 --> 40:45.443
Yes, ma'am.

41:07.029 --> 41:09.641
-Hey!
-Help! Please!

41:09.684 --> 41:11.556
-Please, I need your help!
-What are you doing?

41:11.599 --> 41:13.514
Marine! Halsey's ship
is on the tarmac.

41:13.558 --> 41:15.516
-Do not let it leave the ground!
-Yes, ma'am!

41:15.560 --> 41:17.300
Shoot it down if you have to!

41:19.738 --> 41:20.869
Where's Master Chief?

41:20.913 --> 41:22.001
Two other Spartans attacked him.

41:22.044 --> 41:23.437
-She's lying.
-I'm not!

41:23.481 --> 41:25.004
-Shut your mouth.
-That's enough.

41:25.047 --> 41:26.919
-Let go of me!
-Go find Master Chief.

41:28.007 --> 41:29.182
You stay here.

41:29.225 --> 41:30.705
-Please!
-Not another word.

41:40.933 --> 41:42.891
The left leg servo
is out of spec.

41:42.935 --> 41:44.850
Take out his knee.

41:44.893 --> 41:46.373
Riz, six o'clock.

41:52.988 --> 41:54.381
Get up!

41:54.424 --> 41:56.078
You're coming with us!

41:56.122 --> 41:58.777
Accessing Warthog.

41:58.820 --> 42:00.996
-Slide right.

42:17.535 --> 42:18.753
Chief, the cable.

42:52.091 --> 42:55.790
Containment pattern
Delta 5-1-6-4!

42:55.834 --> 42:58.488
Do not let that ship take off!

43:00.795 --> 43:03.189
We're out of time.
We have to go.

43:03.232 --> 43:06.192
Your Spartans aren't coming.
Let's go!

43:06.235 --> 43:08.411
Not yet.

43:22.425 --> 43:25.211
Two more shots
to disable Vannak's shields.

43:28.606 --> 43:31.783
Doesn't have
to end this way, Chief.

43:31.826 --> 43:33.132
Chief!

43:45.405 --> 43:47.494
Take the shot, Riz.

43:47.537 --> 43:51.454
Exactly how did you manage
to get away from two Spartans?

43:51.498 --> 43:54.719
John spoke with someone
in his head.

43:54.762 --> 43:56.111
Cortana.

43:56.155 --> 43:58.113
He sent me away,
but they found him.

43:58.157 --> 44:00.115
Halsey.
It has to be Dr. Halsey.

44:00.159 --> 44:01.726
Halsey?

44:01.769 --> 44:04.250
-Where's Dr. Halsey now?
-I don't know!

44:04.293 --> 44:06.165
John sent me to find you.
He needs your help--

44:06.208 --> 44:09.603
Keep her away! It was her voice
on the recording from Gladius.

44:09.647 --> 44:12.693
I heard you! You slaughtered
that entire crew.

44:12.737 --> 44:14.129
I had no choice.

44:14.173 --> 44:16.392
-So, it's true.
-Malya!

44:16.436 --> 44:17.698
I'm sorry.

44:17.742 --> 44:19.004
No, no! Please!
Talk to John.

44:19.047 --> 44:20.614
He knows who I really am.

44:20.658 --> 44:22.485
When John finds out,
he'll kill you himself.

44:22.529 --> 44:24.270
No, no, please!

44:24.313 --> 44:25.619
Please!

44:35.063 --> 44:36.804
Don't!

44:37.892 --> 44:39.720
Humans are the problem.

44:42.810 --> 44:44.159
I said take the shot!

44:45.770 --> 44:46.684
Riz...

44:48.598 --> 44:49.774
it's me.

44:58.913 --> 45:00.393
You'll pay for this.

45:07.922 --> 45:09.707
No!

45:31.685 --> 45:33.382
Goodbye, John.

45:34.470 --> 45:35.558
No.
