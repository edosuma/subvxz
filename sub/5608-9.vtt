(spits)

00:22.089 --> 00:23.955
Hey, old man.

00:23.957 --> 00:25.991
Give me your money.

00:27.094 --> 00:28.059
Come on!

00:28.061 --> 00:29.161
(blade clicks)

00:29.163 --> 00:30.629
You know what time it is.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.330
I know what time it is.

00:32.332 --> 00:33.765
Get down on the ground.

00:33.767 --> 00:34.833
JANKO:
Police! Don't move!

00:34.835 --> 00:36.201
Get on your knees!
Get on your knees!

00:36.203 --> 00:37.235
JAMIE: Police! Hold it!
JANKO: On your knees!

00:37.237 --> 00:39.471
On your knees!
Hands in the air!

00:39.473 --> 00:42.174
(man grunts, horn honks)

00:42.176 --> 00:43.975
(horn beeps, man shouts)

00:45.212 --> 00:46.545
JAMIE:
Police! Stop!

00:48.582 --> 00:52.250
(panting)

01:04.197 --> 01:05.697
(man groaning)

01:07.734 --> 01:10.869

01:10.871 --> 01:12.103
(barking, growling)

01:18.378 --> 01:20.111
(sighs)

01:23.550 --> 01:26.022
Come on, Lady Five-O,
we ain't even did nothing.

01:26.023 --> 01:27.289
Right. You nice boys

01:27.291 --> 01:28.913
were just out for a
little midnight stroll.

01:28.937 --> 01:29.860
Exactly.

01:29.861 --> 01:31.894
JAMIE: You guys were just welcoming
us to the neighborhood.

01:31.896 --> 01:33.229
Yo, look, for real,

01:33.231 --> 01:34.363
us three here,
we didn't even know

01:34.365 --> 01:35.698
he was gonna hold you up.
Sit down.

01:35.700 --> 01:37.240
Not even.
JAMIE: Sit down.

01:37.739 --> 01:39.271
Last month, there have been
over half a dozen

01:39.272 --> 01:40.472
armed robberies on that block.

01:40.549 --> 01:42.574
And every one of them went
down just like the one

01:42.575 --> 01:44.608
you boys tried to pull tonight.
Really?

01:44.610 --> 01:46.543
We didn't know nothing
about no robberies. Right?

01:46.545 --> 01:47.578
Robberies?
Nope.

01:47.580 --> 01:49.580
Nice act, Schlenger.
JAMIE: Hang on.

01:49.582 --> 01:51.415
You guys didn't want anyone
to get hurt, right?

01:51.417 --> 01:52.649
No doubt.
You guys were

01:52.651 --> 01:53.817
just the look-out, right?
Just making sure

01:53.819 --> 01:55.219
no cops were coming up
the block?

01:55.221 --> 01:57.187
That's it right there.
We were just the look-out.

01:57.189 --> 01:58.489
We weren't looking
to hurt nobody.

01:58.491 --> 02:01.091
Well, I'm happy
to hear you guys say that.

02:01.093 --> 02:02.493
And so we get off, then, right?

02:02.495 --> 02:04.995
Unfortunately, the legal term
for what you just confessed to

02:04.997 --> 02:06.363
is called "acting in concert."

02:06.365 --> 02:08.098
Say what?
It means you're just as guilty

02:08.100 --> 02:09.800
as your friend
who pulled the knife.

02:09.801 --> 02:10.967
Oh, my God!
Nah, nah!

02:10.970 --> 02:12.102
What?!
Come on, man!

02:12.104 --> 02:13.437
Yep, that's what
the law says.

02:13.439 --> 02:14.438
That's tough!

02:14.440 --> 02:18.542
Victory is mine, people,
victory is mine!

02:18.544 --> 02:21.612
It's a great day for the
criminal justice system.

02:21.614 --> 02:23.514
(applause)
Thank you, thank you.

02:23.516 --> 02:26.116
And you are welcome.
Let me guess-- you won?

02:26.118 --> 02:28.252
No, I didn't win.
Winning is for losers.

02:28.254 --> 02:31.922
I crushed, I obliterated,
I annihilated it.

02:31.924 --> 02:34.892
Feeling pretty good about
yourself, now, are ya?

02:34.894 --> 02:37.361
No. You know what
I'm feeling good about?

02:37.363 --> 02:39.463
These-- three days

02:39.465 --> 02:42.299
at the beach,
toes in the sand,

02:42.301 --> 02:45.235
book in my hand,
and nothing on my plate.

02:45.237 --> 02:46.637
Yeah, about that--
the D.A. just called.

02:46.639 --> 02:49.306
No, no, no, no, no--
I'm already out the door.

02:49.308 --> 02:51.241
Assistant District Attorney
Blake's jury hung

02:51.243 --> 02:52.443
on a homicide she was trying.

02:52.445 --> 02:54.511
Judge declared
a mistrial.

02:54.513 --> 02:56.180
D.A. wants you to take over.

02:56.182 --> 02:58.982
The D.A. wants me to take over
Kelly Blake's case?

02:58.984 --> 03:01.985
(chuckles): Wow, she must be
thrilled about that.

03:01.987 --> 03:04.555
WOMAN:
No, not very.

03:05.291 --> 03:08.192
Thought your case
was a slam dunk.

03:08.194 --> 03:09.893
You're enjoying this already,
aren't you?

03:09.895 --> 03:11.094
No, not very.

03:11.096 --> 03:13.430
You just cost me
three days on the beach.

03:13.432 --> 03:15.399
(throws tickets down)

03:20.706 --> 03:22.439
Olivia, isn't there
anything we can do

03:22.441 --> 03:24.708
to make you more comfortable?
Would you like to sit?

03:24.710 --> 03:26.343
Thank you, Commissioner,
but these days,

03:26.345 --> 03:28.312
once I sit, I can
never get back up.

03:28.314 --> 03:30.314
And we're about
30 seconds out.

03:30.316 --> 03:31.381
Okay.

03:31.383 --> 03:33.016
How far along are you?

03:33.018 --> 03:34.384
A day past due.
Wow.

03:34.386 --> 03:35.619
Can't come soon enough.

03:35.621 --> 03:36.854
(both laugh)

03:36.856 --> 03:38.188
Boy or girl?

03:38.190 --> 03:40.657
Uh... we've decided to wait.

03:40.659 --> 03:42.092
Mm. The old-fashioned way.

03:42.094 --> 03:45.128
Maybe we should get down to the
press room before junior makes his

03:45.130 --> 03:47.798
or her grand entrance.
Okay.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.366
Manny...

03:49.368 --> 03:50.801
you okay?

03:50.803 --> 03:53.604
Yes, sir. I'm just, uh...

03:53.606 --> 03:55.239
there's a lot going on.

03:55.241 --> 03:56.573
Well, get used to it.

03:56.575 --> 03:59.009
You're about to be
NYPD <i> and</i> a dad.

03:59.600 --> 04:02.534
I just want you to know
what a great honor this is,

04:02.536 --> 04:04.269
your taking the time
to do this.

04:04.271 --> 04:06.305
The honor's mine.

04:06.307 --> 04:07.806
(door opens)

04:07.808 --> 04:10.342
Commissioner.
Shall we, everybody?

04:12.813 --> 04:15.647
It's not like they're
gonna start without me.

04:21.154 --> 04:23.956
BLAKE: Two months ago,
Victor and Louise Kendrick

04:23.958 --> 04:27.359
are victims of a carjacking
by this man, Angel Granderson.

04:27.361 --> 04:29.261
Thank you.
Victor Kendrick

04:29.263 --> 04:32.498
makes the fateful mistake
of struggling with Angel,

04:32.500 --> 04:34.666
and he got shot three
times with a .38.

04:34.668 --> 04:36.235
He got a record?
No.

04:36.237 --> 04:38.170
Two priors for...

04:38.172 --> 04:40.739
you guessed it--
carjacking.

04:40.741 --> 04:44.443
He gave an alibi that
didn't hold, and we had

04:44.445 --> 04:46.612
the star witness--
the victim's wife,

04:46.614 --> 04:48.080
Louise Kendrick.

04:48.082 --> 04:50.516
She was in the passenger seat--
she saw the whole thing

04:50.518 --> 04:53.452
go down, and she immediately
picked Angel out of the lineup.

04:54.421 --> 04:56.822
Sounds good.
Where'd you go wrong?

04:56.824 --> 04:58.624
I didn't go wrong.

04:58.626 --> 05:00.292
You did if we're having
this conversation,

05:00.294 --> 05:01.727
and I'm pretty sure we are.

05:01.729 --> 05:04.429
I got stuck with a bad juror.

05:04.431 --> 05:06.832
Elliot North-- this guy...
this guy was a problem,

05:06.834 --> 05:08.634
the whole trial,
for both sides.

05:08.636 --> 05:11.603
Retired, bored, looking to
be a fly in the ointment.

05:11.605 --> 05:13.639
And it could happen
to anyone, even you.

05:13.641 --> 05:15.674
Your point?

05:15.676 --> 05:17.075
(clears throat)

05:17.077 --> 05:18.777
Speak to the D.A.

05:18.779 --> 05:20.212
And say what?

05:20.214 --> 05:22.814
Due respect...
this is my case.

05:22.816 --> 05:26.051
Okay, I put in the legwork--
I should be the one who gets

05:26.053 --> 05:28.053
to see it through.
<i>Was</i> your case,

05:28.055 --> 05:30.289
and you didn't see it through.
Due respect.

05:30.291 --> 05:31.590
You know what I meant.

05:31.592 --> 05:35.460
Look, you and I have managed
to coexist around here

05:35.462 --> 05:37.362
because we share
a mutual understanding

05:37.364 --> 05:39.231
that it's better if we exist

05:39.233 --> 05:40.499
far apart
from each other.

05:40.501 --> 05:41.900
Now, I don't want
this case

05:41.902 --> 05:43.802
any more than
you want me to have it,

05:43.804 --> 05:46.138
but have it I do,
and there's not a damn thing

05:46.140 --> 05:47.973
either one of us
can do about it.

05:48.776 --> 05:50.309
Great. Good talk.

05:51.712 --> 05:53.178
And for the record,
none of these

05:53.180 --> 05:54.780
are <i> our</i> cases.

05:54.782 --> 05:57.115
We represent the people
of the City of New York.

05:57.117 --> 05:59.017
Really?
Gonna go high road on me, huh?

05:59.019 --> 06:01.053
Just get me the numbers
and the addresses

06:01.055 --> 06:03.222
of the juror and Mrs. Kendrick.

06:03.224 --> 06:05.657
Those are <i> my</i> files now.

06:11.498 --> 06:13.298
(sighs heavily)

06:14.268 --> 06:16.235
...and will faithfully
discharge my duties

06:16.237 --> 06:19.638
as a police officer in the New York City
Police Department,

06:19.640 --> 06:21.139
so help me God.

06:21.141 --> 06:23.342
Congratulations.

06:23.344 --> 06:25.577
Nice going.
(chuckles): Thank you.

06:26.480 --> 06:27.713
GARRETT:
We can take

06:27.715 --> 06:28.981
just a few questions.

06:28.983 --> 06:31.817
Uh, Commissioner, how does it feel
to swear in the man

06:31.819 --> 06:33.485
who you rescued
as a little baby,

06:33.487 --> 06:35.387
25 years ago, from a Dumpster?

06:35.389 --> 06:39.958
Well... I guess maybe it's like
a seed was planted that day

06:39.960 --> 06:41.827
and now we get to celebrate
the harvest.

06:41.829 --> 06:43.829
REPORTER: Mr. Francisco,
is that why you became a cop,

06:43.831 --> 06:46.832
because of the commissioner's
hand in saving your life?

06:46.834 --> 06:49.234
Well, a police officer's
first job is to protect life.

06:49.236 --> 06:51.370
But with that
responsibility,

06:51.372 --> 06:53.739
also comes an opportunity
to change lives.

06:53.741 --> 06:54.873
I was fortunate enough

06:54.875 --> 06:57.509
to have someone in my life
who did both for me.

06:57.511 --> 07:00.646
And now it's my turn,
to pay it forward.

07:00.648 --> 07:01.647
GARRETT:
Thank you very much

07:01.649 --> 07:03.215
for joining us today.
Commissioner?

07:03.217 --> 07:06.551
Commissioner, it's been a few weeks
since the mayor won reelection.

07:06.553 --> 07:08.487
You haven't said whether or not
you'll be staying on

07:08.489 --> 07:09.755
as commissioner
for his next term.

07:09.757 --> 07:11.556
Well, that wouldn't
be for me to say.

07:11.558 --> 07:13.558
I serve at the pleasure
of the mayor.

07:13.560 --> 07:15.093
Are you saying
he hasn't yet asked you

07:15.095 --> 07:17.262
to continue as commissioner?
I'm saying we haven't yet

07:17.264 --> 07:19.398
had that conversation.
MALE REPORTER: But you do expect

07:19.400 --> 07:20.465
he'll ask you?

07:20.467 --> 07:22.567
I expect he will,
if he wants me back.

07:22.569 --> 07:25.203
If he doesn't, he won't.
Warren, Angela, Robert,

07:25.205 --> 07:27.272
thank you, that will be
all for today.

07:27.274 --> 07:28.940
Thank you.
ANGELA: Are you saying

07:28.942 --> 07:30.475
you may not come back?

07:30.477 --> 07:31.610
There's no hidden meaning here.

07:31.612 --> 07:33.412
I don't call that shot;
the mayor does.

07:33.414 --> 07:35.113
Well, assuming
the mayor does ask,

07:35.115 --> 07:37.649
you <i> would</i> continue
as commissioner, correct?

07:37.651 --> 07:39.484
Assuming he asks...

07:39.486 --> 07:41.320
you'll know my answer.

07:41.322 --> 07:43.822
That's how the world works.

Mrs. Kendrick,
I just want to thank you

08:19.335 --> 08:21.802
for taking the time out
to sit with me.

08:21.804 --> 08:23.237
Of course.

08:23.239 --> 08:26.807
I just thought we should get
to know each other a little bit

08:26.809 --> 08:28.375
before the new trial.

08:28.377 --> 08:30.644
I still...

08:30.646 --> 08:32.980
I just can't believe it.

08:32.982 --> 08:35.416
I know you're upset
and I know it's hard,

08:35.418 --> 08:37.251
and I am so sorry.

08:37.253 --> 08:40.788
What that juror did,
it's like a slap in the face.

08:40.789 --> 08:43.823
How can just one person
be allowed to do this?

08:43.826 --> 08:46.694
Well, I'm sure you're aware,
in a criminal proceeding,

08:46.696 --> 08:49.296
the jury's verdict
must be unanimous.

08:49.298 --> 08:51.231
Even if one of them is...

08:51.233 --> 08:53.600
I-I don't want
to be rude,

08:53.602 --> 08:58.072
but... A.D.A. Blake pegged him
as a problem from the get-go.

08:58.074 --> 08:59.239
Well, I'm not sure

08:59.241 --> 09:02.443
she should have mentioned
that to you, but...

09:02.445 --> 09:04.144
let's look at it this way--

09:04.146 --> 09:06.847
we have the advantage here
to improve our case

09:06.849 --> 09:08.248
before the new trial.

09:08.250 --> 09:11.118
I will never forget
the look of death

09:11.120 --> 09:13.120
in Angel Granderson's eyes

09:13.122 --> 09:15.723
the night he took
my Victor from me,

09:15.725 --> 09:19.760
just the same way it did,
every day, in that courtroom.

09:19.762 --> 09:21.795
So please forgive me

09:21.797 --> 09:25.265
if I can't get giddy about a new trial.
No, I understand,

09:25.267 --> 09:27.167
and... again, I'm sorry,

09:27.169 --> 09:29.403
and I would feel
exactly the same way

09:29.405 --> 09:32.106
if I were in your shoes.

09:32.108 --> 09:34.942
Unfortunately,
we don't have a choice.

09:34.944 --> 09:38.012
Do you even know why that juror
voted not guilty?

09:38.014 --> 09:41.281
I'm going to see him
later on this afternoon.

09:41.283 --> 09:43.350
Give him this.

09:43.352 --> 09:45.219
And then you tell him

09:45.221 --> 09:47.287
that in <i> my</i> book,

09:47.289 --> 09:51.258
he is now an accomplice
to my Victor's murder.

09:53.629 --> 09:57.664
(chief shouting
instructions)

10:00.036 --> 10:02.836
Excuse me, sir,
is this your car?

10:02.838 --> 10:03.837
<i>Was</i> my car.

10:03.839 --> 10:05.272
Did you see
who did it?

10:05.274 --> 10:07.608
No, but I can tell you
who did it, anyway.

10:07.610 --> 10:09.309
It was the damn gang.

10:09.311 --> 10:10.978
They're tormenting
this neighborhood.

10:10.980 --> 10:12.801
It's like, every day
it's a different thing.

10:12.825 --> 10:13.581
We know.

10:13.582 --> 10:15.482
We arrested three of them
just the other night.

10:15.484 --> 10:16.950
We thought that
would send a message.

10:16.952 --> 10:19.019
I guess
it didn't.

10:19.021 --> 10:20.988
Excuse me, sir,
do you live around here?

10:20.990 --> 10:22.656
Nope, but I own a few
of these buildings.

10:22.658 --> 10:24.958
Maybe you can help us out--
do you know of any gang members

10:24.960 --> 10:26.593
that are living in any
of your buildings?

10:26.595 --> 10:28.429
Oh, I'd love
to help you out,

10:28.431 --> 10:30.297
but we're talking
about gangs.

10:34.603 --> 10:36.370
Officer, what's going on?

10:36.372 --> 10:38.505
Why does this keep happening?

10:38.507 --> 10:40.207
We honestly
don't know.

10:40.209 --> 10:42.743
But you have my word--
we're gonna put an end to this.

10:47.416 --> 10:49.783
Well, that was interesting.
Huh?

10:49.785 --> 10:52.052
I seem to recall a guy
who looks just like you

10:52.054 --> 10:53.921
once telling me
that a cop should never

10:53.923 --> 10:55.656
make a promise
that they can't keep.

10:55.658 --> 10:57.858
I intend to keep it.
Something doesn't add up.

10:57.860 --> 11:00.260
These guys hit again
just a couple of days

11:00.262 --> 11:02.062
after we lock
a bunch of them up?

11:02.064 --> 11:04.098
They're a gang.
That's what they do.

11:04.100 --> 11:06.834
Hit the same block half a dozen
times in under a month?

11:06.836 --> 11:08.769
Well, one block
that <i> we</i> know of.

11:08.771 --> 11:10.003
Maybe they're terrorizing
the whole neighborhood

11:10.005 --> 11:11.472
but just not
reporting it.

11:11.474 --> 11:13.140
I don't think so. I checked--
it's just this block.

11:13.142 --> 11:16.677
And nothing in this or any
surrounding precincts.

11:16.679 --> 11:20.080
Then you're right.
We better find out why.

11:22.351 --> 11:24.184
(doorbell rings)

11:24.186 --> 11:25.719
MAN:
Who is it?

11:25.721 --> 11:28.522
It's Erin Reagan.
We spoke on the phone earlier.

11:30.993 --> 11:33.627
And I told you
I've got nothing to say.

11:33.629 --> 11:37.397
I was just hoping for
a few minutes of your time, sir.

11:37.399 --> 11:39.299
I did my civic duty.

11:39.301 --> 11:42.035
I served on that jury
and voted my conscience.

11:42.037 --> 11:43.637
And we appreciate that.

11:43.639 --> 11:45.439
It's only because
of citizens like you

11:45.441 --> 11:48.375
that our criminal
justice system works.

11:48.377 --> 11:49.877
What the hell
else do you want?

11:49.879 --> 11:52.613
I was just trying to understand
why you voted not guilty.

11:52.615 --> 11:54.248
Why do
you think?

11:54.250 --> 11:55.716
'Cause that guy didn't do it.

11:55.718 --> 11:57.951
There's 11 other jurors
who disagree.

11:57.953 --> 11:59.987
Those 11 other jurors
were morons.

11:59.989 --> 12:03.123
Can I come in
and you tell me why?

12:03.125 --> 12:05.159
Is this even legal?
I thought a member

12:05.161 --> 12:07.895
of the jury wasn't supposed
to talk about the case.

12:07.897 --> 12:09.263
That's only true
during the trial.

12:09.265 --> 12:12.633
Afterwards you're free
to discuss it as you please.

12:12.635 --> 12:15.435
Five minutes.

12:17.173 --> 12:18.805
Thank you.

12:20.976 --> 12:23.243
(indistinct chatter,
cameras clicking and whirring)

12:24.980 --> 12:27.581
Afternoon, everyone.

12:27.583 --> 12:29.850
Uh, DCPI Moore has briefed me

12:29.852 --> 12:32.819
that we have lot of ground
to cover and limited time,

12:32.821 --> 12:34.755
so let's try to help
each other out by...

12:34.757 --> 12:36.690
Commissioner, have you heard
from the mayor yet?

12:36.692 --> 12:38.892
...by sticking to the
updates and clarifications

12:38.894 --> 12:42.529
prioritized in the handouts.

12:42.531 --> 12:46.500
I am pleased to report that,
uh, last month we've seen

12:46.502 --> 12:50.003
violent crime numbers
take a precipitous drop.

12:50.005 --> 12:51.471
Any indication
if he'll be asking you

12:51.473 --> 12:53.740
to stay on as commissioner?
Guys,

12:53.742 --> 12:55.709
we have a lot to get
through here today,

12:55.711 --> 12:57.211
so if you'd
let us please...

12:57.213 --> 12:58.378
FEMALE REPORTER: Or are we
missing the lead--

12:58.380 --> 12:59.880
do you even
want to come back?

12:59.882 --> 13:01.215
Pardon me?

13:01.217 --> 13:02.282
When asked the other day

13:02.284 --> 13:03.784
how you would respond
if the mayor

13:03.786 --> 13:05.886
offered to keep you on
for four more years,

13:05.888 --> 13:07.321
you chose not to respond.

13:07.323 --> 13:08.322
That's true.

13:08.324 --> 13:10.757
Because?
Because?

13:10.759 --> 13:12.226
Because that's between
me and the mayor.

13:12.228 --> 13:14.962
Because some matters
should be decided

13:14.964 --> 13:16.997
between the principals and then,

13:16.999 --> 13:19.199
once resolved,
released to the press.

13:19.201 --> 13:21.468
Due respect, sir, you still
haven't answered my question.

13:21.470 --> 13:24.438
Due respect, your question
boils down to exactly how

13:24.440 --> 13:26.540
are the sausages made?
I don't think that's

13:26.542 --> 13:28.775
anybody's business
but mine and the mayor's

13:28.777 --> 13:30.244
at this juncture.
Are you saying

13:30.246 --> 13:32.179
you'll only answer questions
that you deem appropriate?

13:32.181 --> 13:34.481
I didn't say that.
You implied it.

13:34.483 --> 13:35.983
Stop.
Sir...!

13:35.985 --> 13:37.584
Enough.

13:37.586 --> 13:40.621
I don't know.
How about that?

13:40.623 --> 13:42.689
Whatever the question is,

13:42.691 --> 13:45.726
there's your answer:
I don't know.

13:47.496 --> 13:50.764
Is this absolutely
necessary?

13:50.766 --> 13:53.433
I don't trust many people.

13:53.435 --> 13:55.402
And definitely not you.

13:55.404 --> 13:58.038
You have a problem
with me, sir?

13:58.040 --> 13:59.773
You're a white lawyer.

13:59.775 --> 14:03.076
I see. And you don't like
white lawyers?

14:03.078 --> 14:04.878
I don't trust white people.

14:04.880 --> 14:06.246
I don't trust lawyers.

14:06.248 --> 14:07.381
So you do the math.

14:07.383 --> 14:11.251
Mr. North, let me
ask you something.

14:11.253 --> 14:13.587
Is it possible that you
voted the way you did

14:13.589 --> 14:15.689
because the defendant is black?

14:15.691 --> 14:17.190
Let me ask you something.

14:17.192 --> 14:18.959
Is it possible

14:18.961 --> 14:21.194
the other jurors
voted the way that they did

14:21.196 --> 14:24.264
just because
the defendant was black?

14:24.266 --> 14:27.100
I see your point.
Good.

14:27.102 --> 14:28.869
But for the record, no.

14:28.871 --> 14:31.538
I did not vote to acquit
for that reason.

14:31.540 --> 14:34.174
I voted not guilty because
I don't think he did it.

14:34.176 --> 14:36.843
Despite all the evidence
to the contrary.

14:36.845 --> 14:37.811
Not all the evidence.

14:37.813 --> 14:39.713
Such as?
Such as

14:39.715 --> 14:43.083
how come we never heard
from the other eyewitness?

14:43.085 --> 14:45.886
The other eyewitness?

14:45.888 --> 14:48.588
The police report that was
submitted into evidence

14:48.590 --> 14:52.025
stated, right there,
that there was another witness

14:52.027 --> 14:55.095
who said the shooter
was a white man.

14:55.097 --> 14:57.497
You're sure about this?

14:57.499 --> 15:01.168
Hand to God.

15:03.339 --> 15:05.639
Anthony, it's me. You busy?

15:07.042 --> 15:08.909
Immensely.

15:08.911 --> 15:10.277
Not anymore you're not.

15:10.279 --> 15:13.113
I need you to pull up a 61
on the Victor Kendrick murder.

15:15.017 --> 15:16.216
What's in it for me?

15:16.218 --> 15:17.417
Your job.

15:17.419 --> 15:18.885
Keep dreaming.

15:18.887 --> 15:20.420
I work for
the district attorney,

15:20.422 --> 15:21.688
I'm only loaned out to you.

15:21.690 --> 15:23.490
You find it yet or not?

15:23.492 --> 15:25.559
I got it. I got it.

15:25.561 --> 15:26.893
What's up?

15:26.895 --> 15:29.696
Did the cops on the scene take
a statement from an eyewitness

15:29.698 --> 15:30.864
other than the victim's wife?

15:30.866 --> 15:32.666
Depends.
Is the victim's wife

15:32.668 --> 15:35.535
a drug-addled,
thrice-collared prostitute?

15:35.537 --> 15:37.170
Uh, no, she's not.

15:37.172 --> 15:40.407
Then, yes, they did.

15:51.777 --> 15:54.077
What is this?

15:56.148 --> 15:59.983
It is the complaint report
on the Kendrick homicide.

16:01.120 --> 16:02.553
So you've read it?

16:02.555 --> 16:05.055
We're not 1L's anymore,
so what do you say

16:05.057 --> 16:07.558
we skip the Socratic method
and you get to the point?

16:07.560 --> 16:09.459
Fine by me.

16:09.461 --> 16:11.261
Who the hell is Robin Dunn?

16:14.366 --> 16:15.866
Oh!
Oh.

16:15.868 --> 16:17.301
You don't tell me
there's a second

16:17.303 --> 16:20.604
eyewitness and the best
you can come up with is "Oh"?

16:20.606 --> 16:22.906
First off, Robin Dunn
is a prostitute

16:22.908 --> 16:25.642
with a history of arrests.
She's hardly a dream witness.

16:25.644 --> 16:27.678
It's a murder case.
Not every witness

16:27.680 --> 16:29.613
is gonna be Mr. Belvedere.

16:29.615 --> 16:32.249
And secondly, we tried
to locate her. The police

16:32.251 --> 16:33.369
scoured the neighborhood

16:33.393 --> 16:35.019
and her last known-- she
probably skipped town.

16:35.020 --> 16:37.955
At which point I can only assume
you asked for a continuance

16:37.957 --> 16:40.457
so you could have more time
to locate her.

16:40.459 --> 16:43.594
Look, we had a rock-solid case.

16:43.596 --> 16:45.495
Louise Kendrick
was in the car.

16:45.497 --> 16:47.164
She picked
Angel Granderson

16:47.166 --> 16:48.232
out of a lineup.

16:48.234 --> 16:49.733
Granderson has previous arrests

16:49.735 --> 16:52.469
for carjacking and fit
the description perfectly.

16:52.471 --> 16:55.205
And I will take that, any day,
over some vague description

16:55.207 --> 16:57.975
given by crackhead
street walker, and so would you.

16:57.977 --> 17:00.010
So, no, you did not
ask for a continuance?

17:00.012 --> 17:03.013
Quit being such a Girl Scout.
We were running out of time.

17:03.015 --> 17:04.948
The D.A. agreed with me
that we should proceed

17:04.950 --> 17:07.017
with the case we had,
So that's what I did.

17:07.019 --> 17:10.087
Check with your C.I.'s
and the NYPD, I want you

17:10.089 --> 17:11.887
to find this girl.
I'm on it.

17:11.890 --> 17:14.090
Where are you going?
To do your job.

17:26.638 --> 17:29.072
I want you to put your wallets
on the ground

17:29.074 --> 17:30.707
and put hands in the air.

17:30.709 --> 17:32.609
Now!
Police! Hold it right there!

17:32.611 --> 17:34.244
FEMALE OFFICER:
Don't move! On the ground!

17:34.246 --> 17:35.412
On the ground!

17:35.414 --> 17:36.847
Don't move,
hands in the air!

17:36.849 --> 17:40.183
Get down on the ground!
Get on the ground!

17:40.185 --> 17:41.351
Get on the ground!
(siren wails, stops)

17:41.353 --> 17:43.220
(grunts) I was kind of hoping
you'd do that.

17:43.222 --> 17:45.856
Yeah, whatever, man.

17:45.858 --> 17:48.659
GARRETT: The mayor wants
this controversy shut down.

17:48.661 --> 17:51.128
Controversy? Can we please
temper the rhetoric a little?

17:51.130 --> 17:53.697
All right--
disagreement.

17:53.699 --> 17:55.399
Mountain out of a molehill,
more like it.

17:55.401 --> 17:56.900
The point is

17:56.902 --> 17:58.902
he'd like to ask
you to stay aboard.

18:00.873 --> 18:03.240
Is that so?
Yes.

18:03.242 --> 18:05.375
Then what's stopping him
from setting up a meeting?

18:05.377 --> 18:07.978
What with standing on
ceremony all of a sudden?

18:07.980 --> 18:09.713
You guys have four years
of work together.

18:09.715 --> 18:11.615
Which I think has earned me
the courtesy

18:11.617 --> 18:14.551
and respect of a formal offer.
Give it up.

18:14.553 --> 18:17.421
He wants to know
that you'll accept.

18:17.423 --> 18:20.223
Ah. Well.

18:20.225 --> 18:21.725
There it is.

18:21.727 --> 18:23.727
There are members of his
inner circle pushing him

18:23.729 --> 18:24.961
to consider
other candidates.

18:24.963 --> 18:26.830
As there have been from day one.

18:26.832 --> 18:27.798
He doesn't
want to be left exposed,

18:27.800 --> 18:28.932
if you have doubts
of your own.

18:28.934 --> 18:31.201
He needs to ask me himself.

18:31.203 --> 18:33.270
He strenuously advises
that you accept the offer as is.

18:33.272 --> 18:36.239
Strenuously advises? How the
hell does one exactly do that?

18:36.241 --> 18:38.608
Is he actively working
every muscle

18:38.610 --> 18:41.578
in his body as he advises?
Frank, this isn't funny.

18:41.580 --> 18:43.413
It kind of is.
Then you're the only one laughing.

18:43.415 --> 18:46.383
The man was reelected weeks ago
and this is the first time

18:46.385 --> 18:49.052
anyone from his camp
has even mentioned it to me.

18:49.054 --> 18:51.088
I am not from his camp.
Even worse.

18:51.090 --> 18:53.790
I'm trying to help out in a situation...
And what you're

18:53.792 --> 18:56.993
bringing me sounds more like
an ultimatum than an invitation.

18:56.995 --> 18:58.462
It's an offer.

18:58.464 --> 19:00.430
Garret, I read the papers.

19:00.432 --> 19:02.466
He has met with everyone

19:02.468 --> 19:05.268
the past couple weeks,
from soup to nuts.

19:05.270 --> 19:06.570
Are you feeling neglected?

19:06.572 --> 19:08.038
Is that why you're playing
this out in the press?

19:08.040 --> 19:10.140
I am not playing anything out.

19:10.142 --> 19:12.476
I answered
their questions honestly.

19:12.478 --> 19:14.911
What do you want me
to tell the mayor's office?

19:14.913 --> 19:16.747
That I'm available to meet.

19:16.749 --> 19:18.148
Have you heard
a thing I've said?

19:18.150 --> 19:19.883
They want some guarantees.

19:19.885 --> 19:22.519
I guarantee I'll show up.

19:22.521 --> 19:24.521
Come on, Frank.
He is the boss.

19:24.523 --> 19:28.058
Yes, he is. And I serve
at the pleasure of the mayor.

19:28.060 --> 19:30.127
But only so long as it is

19:30.129 --> 19:32.729
my pleasure to serve.

19:34.166 --> 19:35.699
(alarm buzzes, lock clicks)

19:50.649 --> 19:52.149
Who are you?

19:52.151 --> 19:54.351
I'm Assistant District Attorney
Erin Reagan.

19:54.353 --> 19:56.086
I'll be prosecuting the retrial.

19:56.088 --> 19:57.587
Where's the other skirt?

19:57.589 --> 19:58.855
If you're referring

19:58.857 --> 20:01.291
to A.D.A. Blake,
she's no longer on the case.

20:01.293 --> 20:02.526
Too bad.

20:02.528 --> 20:05.028
She got legs for days.

20:05.030 --> 20:06.930
Well, I'll be sure
to pass that along.

20:06.932 --> 20:09.166
Hm.
Mr. Granderson,

20:09.168 --> 20:11.334
you do realize
that you are facing

20:11.336 --> 20:13.837
the minimum sentence
of 12 years here.

20:13.839 --> 20:15.071
Is what it is.

20:15.073 --> 20:17.040
Well, if that's
how you really feel,

20:17.042 --> 20:19.176
why don't you
save us all a lot of time

20:19.178 --> 20:21.411
and money and
just plead guilty?

20:21.413 --> 20:22.879
'Cause I didn't do it.

20:24.249 --> 20:25.782
She got legs for days.

20:25.784 --> 20:28.552
What? She do.

20:28.554 --> 20:30.954
You don't sound like someone
who believes he's innocent.

20:30.956 --> 20:33.056
We both know how this goes.

20:33.058 --> 20:35.058
You know,
a lot of hooting

20:35.060 --> 20:37.394
and hollering by me

20:37.396 --> 20:39.663
ain't gonna change a damn thing.

20:39.665 --> 20:42.566
Okay.

20:42.568 --> 20:45.335
Well, then I hope you enjoy
your stay with us

20:45.337 --> 20:47.571
and I will see you in court.

20:49.208 --> 20:50.740
Wait.

20:54.513 --> 20:55.979
I'm sorry.

21:05.491 --> 21:07.491
Did you kill Victor Kendrick?

21:07.493 --> 21:08.592
Hell, no.

21:08.594 --> 21:10.193
You've been arrested

21:10.195 --> 21:13.730
in three other carjackings,
all with the same methodology.

21:13.732 --> 21:15.198
What?

21:15.200 --> 21:16.566
They were all done

21:16.568 --> 21:19.102
the same way this one was done:
guy in a hoodie

21:19.104 --> 21:21.538
puts a gun in the
driver's face,

21:21.540 --> 21:22.606
demands the car.

21:22.608 --> 21:25.475
<i>Almost</i> the same.

21:27.246 --> 21:31.715
Let's just say <i> if</i> I did
those other carjackings,

21:31.717 --> 21:33.917
I would have never used
a loaded gun.

21:33.919 --> 21:36.753
Come on, you expect me
to believe that?

21:36.755 --> 21:37.754
It's true.

21:37.756 --> 21:39.523
Prove it.

21:39.525 --> 21:42.025
Can't.

21:42.027 --> 21:44.661
Well, then, I guess
I <i> can't</i> help you.

21:44.663 --> 21:46.830
Look...

21:49.835 --> 21:51.868
When I was ten years old,

21:51.870 --> 21:55.639
my baby brother--

21:55.641 --> 21:59.042
we were playing on our stoop.

21:59.878 --> 22:02.145
Next thing I know-- pop,

22:02.147 --> 22:04.481
pop, pop!

22:06.118 --> 22:10.554
It was chaos everywhere.

22:10.556 --> 22:14.190
And when I looked down,

22:14.192 --> 22:17.060
my baby brother was dying
at my feet.

22:20.399 --> 22:23.233
No way

22:23.235 --> 22:26.436
I could ever blast on somebody.

22:28.473 --> 22:30.640
(phone ringing)

22:33.845 --> 22:36.446
Yeah, what's up?

22:36.448 --> 22:37.714
Hey, it's Anthony.

22:37.716 --> 22:39.149
I know. What do you got?

22:39.151 --> 22:42.218
A dead prostitute.

22:42.220 --> 22:44.254
I think
you should get down here.

22:56.913 --> 23:00.414
(radio chatter; distant siren
wails, horn blares)

23:00.416 --> 23:02.750
I just want to say
for the record,

23:02.752 --> 23:04.485
I don't like that look
in your eyes.

23:04.487 --> 23:06.620
What am I doing?
You're turning your wheels.

23:06.622 --> 23:08.789
And that's bad?
Usually.

23:08.791 --> 23:11.659
I just want to know who
killed that poor girl.

23:11.661 --> 23:13.260
Poor girl?

23:13.262 --> 23:15.196
Are we working
on the same case?

23:15.198 --> 23:18.065
'Cause I'm on the one with
the hooker, not the soccer mom.

23:18.067 --> 23:19.967
Justice is blind, Anthony.

23:19.969 --> 23:23.037
Yeah, and dead hookers are
easier to find than yellow cabs.

23:23.039 --> 23:25.005
Yeah, usually from
suicides and OD,

23:25.007 --> 23:26.874
not a bullet
between their eyes.

23:26.876 --> 23:30.277
So she ran afoul of some nut-job
John, or a pissed-off pimp.

23:30.279 --> 23:31.679
Or a murderer who killed her

23:31.681 --> 23:33.180
because she was
the only eyewitness

23:33.182 --> 23:34.448
who could put him away.

23:34.450 --> 23:36.350
Now you write Lifetime movies?
Come on.

23:36.352 --> 23:37.651
That body's been there
for weeks.

23:37.653 --> 23:39.954
You and I both know
the coroner's gonna date it back

23:39.956 --> 23:41.055
to the Kendrick murder.

23:41.057 --> 23:45.025
Okay, okay, you got a point;
a very small point.

23:45.027 --> 23:47.394
I met
with Angel Granderson today.

23:47.396 --> 23:48.829
Oh, no.
And I don't...

23:48.831 --> 23:50.831
Don't think he did it.
...think he did it.

23:50.833 --> 23:53.067
My gut tells me
he's a really bad guy

23:53.069 --> 23:54.668
who's done a lot of bad things.

23:54.670 --> 23:56.370
I don't think
he did this thing.

23:56.372 --> 23:58.405
And if your golden gut
is wrong?

23:58.407 --> 24:00.074
It's not.

24:00.076 --> 24:02.843
(sighs) Well, if Granderson
didn't do it,

24:02.845 --> 24:05.279
then you know
who the next likely suspect is.

24:05.281 --> 24:06.847
The victim's wife Louise.

24:06.849 --> 24:08.215
That's right.

24:08.217 --> 24:11.752
So you think that everything
Louise Kendrick said is a lie?

24:11.754 --> 24:13.754
I'm becoming more open
to that possibility.

24:13.756 --> 24:15.322
And why would she

24:15.324 --> 24:17.558
do all that
unless she herself was involved

24:17.560 --> 24:18.792
in her husband's murder?

24:18.794 --> 24:20.728
She wouldn't.
See?

24:20.730 --> 24:24.331
Now you know why I hate
when your wheels start turning.

24:28.070 --> 24:29.670
Here you go.

24:29.672 --> 24:31.472
Here, have a seat.

24:31.474 --> 24:34.008
You know when we add
these four goons to the three

24:34.010 --> 24:36.243
my partner and I locked up
the other day,

24:36.245 --> 24:37.378
it's like... damn near arrested

24:37.380 --> 24:39.780
half your gang.

24:39.782 --> 24:42.249
Heavy is the head
that wears the crown, huh?

24:42.251 --> 24:43.817
What?
Just saying.

24:43.819 --> 24:46.120
Not a great week
for you as boss,

24:46.122 --> 24:48.355
but maybe there's something
you can do to fix that.

24:48.357 --> 24:50.357
Here we go, hmm?

24:50.359 --> 24:52.126
Time for <i> Let's Make a Deal.</i>

24:52.128 --> 24:53.794
Guess what?

24:53.796 --> 24:55.029
Rainey don't deal.

24:55.031 --> 24:57.331
You could save you and your boys
a lot of jail time

24:57.333 --> 24:59.066
if you come clean
about what's really going on.

24:59.068 --> 25:00.501
You know what, man?

25:00.503 --> 25:02.803
I don't even, like, understand
a single thing you saying.

25:02.805 --> 25:04.338
Sure you do.

25:04.340 --> 25:05.973
You're smarter than you play.

25:07.076 --> 25:08.809
Why would you and your crew
hit the same block

25:08.811 --> 25:10.010
six times in a month?

25:10.012 --> 25:11.712
I ain't saying nothing.
If someone else

25:11.714 --> 25:13.614
is behind this,
maybe we could trade up.

25:13.616 --> 25:15.382
Get you
and your crew a year,

25:15.384 --> 25:17.851
maybe just probation.
You know what, man?

25:17.853 --> 25:19.486
You're right.

25:19.488 --> 25:21.088
I am smart.

25:21.090 --> 25:23.691
Smart enough to know
that the most we gonna get is

25:23.693 --> 25:26.226
six months,
probably three...

25:26.228 --> 25:28.596
(chuckles)
if we wear ties to court.

25:28.598 --> 25:30.631
(chuckling)
Yeah, you're right, except

25:30.633 --> 25:32.132
there's this
little known section of

25:32.134 --> 25:34.368
the penal law that I discovered
when I was at law school.

25:34.370 --> 25:36.337
It's called
"enterprise corruption."

25:36.339 --> 25:37.805
Hmm.
I won't bore you with the details,

25:37.807 --> 25:39.506
but basically what it says is,

25:39.508 --> 25:41.675
since you've repeated
the same crime multiple times,

25:41.677 --> 25:42.876
minimum for you

25:42.878 --> 25:45.079
is five years upstate.
Please.

25:45.081 --> 25:47.181
(laughing):
You ain't go to no law school.

25:47.183 --> 25:48.949
You just a cop.

25:55.758 --> 25:58.025
(handcuffs rattling)
Let's go.

26:00.096 --> 26:02.062
(distant siren chirping)

26:03.099 --> 26:04.498
GORMLEY:
Would you stop?

26:04.500 --> 26:05.666
You're being crazy.

26:05.668 --> 26:07.034
You don't understand.

26:07.036 --> 26:08.418
Brian and I just bought
the house last year.

26:08.442 --> 26:09.571
So?

26:09.572 --> 26:11.872
So, Lord knows the commissioner
has earned the right

26:11.874 --> 26:14.508
to say when he's done, but if he is...
Stop right here.

26:14.510 --> 26:17.244
First of all, you're
an NYPD detective.

26:17.246 --> 26:19.046
Even if the boss
calls it quits,

26:19.048 --> 26:20.481
no way you're
losing your job.

26:20.483 --> 26:21.715
But I would be
transferred.

26:21.717 --> 26:23.584
And second of all,
it's not gonna happen.

26:23.586 --> 26:25.786
Is he in?
He's wrapping up a phone call.

26:25.788 --> 26:27.755
Garrett, would you do me a favor
and tell her she's got

26:27.757 --> 26:28.822
nothing to worry about?

26:28.824 --> 26:30.624
You got nothing to worry about.
See?

26:30.626 --> 26:32.793
You're golden. Thank you.
Sure.

26:32.795 --> 26:34.962
What did I just tell
her not to worry about?

26:34.964 --> 26:36.697
She's getting herself
all worked up about this

26:36.699 --> 26:37.931
brouhaha with the boss.

26:37.933 --> 26:40.768
She actually thinks he might be
putting in his papers.

26:41.904 --> 26:44.004
Wait a second.

26:44.006 --> 26:45.639
You don't think
he's done, do you?

26:45.641 --> 26:47.174
You do?!

26:47.176 --> 26:49.143
(sighs):
Oh.

26:49.145 --> 26:52.312
Know what that means for me?
Staten Island.

26:52.314 --> 26:55.549
Look, I don't know
how this plays out.

26:55.551 --> 26:57.918
What I do know is,
it's not a good idea

26:57.920 --> 27:01.055
for us to sit around
here talking about it.

27:02.324 --> 27:04.291
I'm not going to
Staten Island-- no way.

27:04.293 --> 27:06.860
NICKY:
<i>Do we even know</i>

27:06.862 --> 27:08.228
who he's talking to?

27:08.230 --> 27:10.197
No, but it's got
to be somebody important,

27:10.199 --> 27:12.099
or he wouldn't
take the call now.

27:12.101 --> 27:13.300
Maybe it's
the mayor.

27:13.302 --> 27:14.568
Whoever it is,
it's none of our business.

27:14.570 --> 27:16.203
Can we ask him
when he comes down?

27:16.205 --> 27:17.371
No.

27:17.373 --> 27:18.572
Why not?

27:18.574 --> 27:19.573
'Cause he said so.

27:19.575 --> 27:20.941
Right, and because

27:20.943 --> 27:23.343
of what Aunt Linda said--
it's not our business.

27:23.345 --> 27:25.079
It is, and it isn't.

27:25.081 --> 27:26.547
What do you mean?

27:26.549 --> 27:28.549
Meaning if he doesn't re-up,
it affects everybody

27:28.551 --> 27:30.150
at this table to some degree.

27:30.152 --> 27:31.552
DANNY:
And we will support him

27:31.554 --> 27:33.487
no matter what
decision he makes.

27:33.489 --> 27:35.055
But what if
it's the wrong decision?

27:35.057 --> 27:36.523
There is no
wrong decision.

27:36.525 --> 27:39.293
There isn't?
No.

27:39.295 --> 27:41.562
Last thing this city needs
is losing Dad as the PC.

27:41.564 --> 27:42.275
Why is that?

27:42.298 --> 27:44.658
Show me another candidate
who's got his chops.

27:44.934 --> 27:47.234
Okay, well, take away our slant
'cause he's our dad,

27:47.236 --> 27:48.569
and there's plenty
of candidates.

27:48.571 --> 27:50.070
Forget the slant.
How many others

27:50.072 --> 27:51.939
have a whole previous career
as an NYPD cop?

27:51.941 --> 27:53.674
That's something Dad brings
that nobody else does.

27:53.676 --> 27:55.109
HENRY:
Jamie's got a point.

27:55.111 --> 27:57.444
But that isn't your point,
is it?

27:57.446 --> 27:58.545
DANNY:
No.

27:58.547 --> 27:59.646
Look, it's true,

27:59.648 --> 28:01.548
Dad <i> has</i> been a cop
for most of his life,

28:01.550 --> 28:03.450
so can you imagine
how hard it's gonna be

28:03.452 --> 28:05.586
to walk away?
I mean, for him,

28:05.588 --> 28:07.087
moving on's gonna be less

28:07.089 --> 28:09.890
like letting go and more like
letting go of an arm or a leg.

28:09.892 --> 28:11.859
Yeah.
If he needs our support,

28:11.861 --> 28:14.294
he's gonna need
our support to let go.

28:14.296 --> 28:17.431
Support is only worth what
it costs you to give it.

28:17.433 --> 28:19.700
So, I say we be smart

28:19.702 --> 28:21.769
and take the cue
from Dad on this one.

28:21.771 --> 28:24.071
Copy?
NICKY: Copy.

28:24.073 --> 28:25.506
Copy that.
Copy.

28:25.508 --> 28:26.807
So what is it
we were talking about?

28:26.809 --> 28:29.042
Anything but the
elephant in the room.

28:29.044 --> 28:30.210
Last season's Knicks.

28:30.212 --> 28:31.779
He hasn't gotten over that yet.

28:31.781 --> 28:33.147
(laughing):
Who has?

28:33.149 --> 28:33.947
They're basketball, right?

28:33.949 --> 28:35.482
(scoffs)
Yes, Mom.

28:35.484 --> 28:37.351
FRANK:
Sorry.

28:37.353 --> 28:38.719
I had to take that call.

28:38.721 --> 28:39.820
It's okay.

28:39.822 --> 28:41.221
(clears his throat)

28:41.223 --> 28:43.157
(Erin clears her throat)

28:43.159 --> 28:44.925
So... where were we?

28:44.927 --> 28:46.693
The Knicks.

28:46.695 --> 28:47.795
LINDA:
Oh, last season

28:47.797 --> 28:49.062
was a bust.
FRANK: Mm.

28:49.064 --> 28:50.998
Yeah, Carmello's
just got to go.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.466
JACK: Phil Jackson's
got to step up.

28:52.468 --> 28:54.168
SEAN: Mm-hmm.
JAMIE: True. DANNY: Mm-hmm.

28:54.170 --> 28:56.103
It was the cardinal.
LINDA: Oh, well,

28:56.105 --> 28:57.437
the cardinal's got
to step up, too.

28:57.439 --> 28:58.939
(Nicky laughs)

28:58.941 --> 29:01.642
No. That's who
I was on the phone with.

29:01.644 --> 29:03.343
Cardinal Brennan.
Oh.

29:03.345 --> 29:04.311
Hmm.

29:04.313 --> 29:06.079
Why the cardinal?

29:06.081 --> 29:08.916
When I'm in a tough spot,
he often helps.

29:08.918 --> 29:09.983
And did he?

29:09.985 --> 29:11.351
Don't know yet.

29:11.353 --> 29:13.487
He assumes
I know more scripture than I do,

29:13.489 --> 29:15.289
so I always have
to look stuff up

29:15.291 --> 29:18.525
to find out
what the advice actually was.

29:18.527 --> 29:20.828
(laughter)

29:20.830 --> 29:22.429
Looks good.

29:22.431 --> 29:23.997
Shall we eat?
HENRY: Sure.

29:26.101 --> 29:29.236
And thank you, all of you,

29:29.238 --> 29:31.872
for the elbow room.

29:32.708 --> 29:33.941
Bless us, O Lord, for these...

29:33.943 --> 29:36.476
ALL:
Thy gifts which we are about

29:36.478 --> 29:38.011
to receive through Thy bounty.

29:38.013 --> 29:40.747
Through Christ, Our Lord.
Amen.

29:44.119 --> 29:46.186
Now, in the last
trial, you said that

29:46.188 --> 29:48.789
when Angel Granderson
approached,

29:48.791 --> 29:50.724
your husband
resisted at first.

29:50.726 --> 29:52.259
(sighs)
I told him not to.

29:52.261 --> 29:54.361
I told him just to do
whatever he said, but...

29:54.363 --> 29:56.496
But he didn't.
Then you say

29:56.498 --> 30:00.434
the carjacker reached in
and tried to grab the keys.

30:00.436 --> 30:02.035
That's right.

30:02.037 --> 30:03.971
Okay. Great.

30:03.973 --> 30:06.740
What hand?
Huh?

30:07.877 --> 30:09.710
Oh, what hand
did the carjacker use

30:09.712 --> 30:11.712
when he reached into the car?

30:11.714 --> 30:14.381
Oh. Um...

30:14.383 --> 30:15.816
You don't remember?

30:15.818 --> 30:18.752
No, I-I... I do.

30:18.754 --> 30:20.821
It was his right hand.

30:20.823 --> 30:23.557
Huh. That's interesting.

30:23.559 --> 30:25.993
Granderson is left-handed.

30:25.995 --> 30:27.461
Maybe I got that wrong.

30:27.463 --> 30:30.163
Yeah, yeah.

30:30.165 --> 30:32.366
You're right,
it-it was his left.

30:32.368 --> 30:34.468
He reached in
with his left hand.

30:34.470 --> 30:36.803
Are you sure?
Because it's important

30:36.805 --> 30:38.505
that we're firm
with these facts.

30:38.507 --> 30:41.408
Yes, positive.
It was his left hand.

30:41.410 --> 30:45.045
Great. Great. Now,

30:45.047 --> 30:47.047
after he couldn't get the keys,

30:47.049 --> 30:49.016
that's when you say
Granderson shot your husband.

30:49.018 --> 30:51.919
(sighing):
That's right... in cold blood.

30:51.921 --> 30:53.620
Yes.

30:54.523 --> 30:57.090
What hand was he holding
the gun?

30:57.092 --> 30:59.226
What? I...?

30:59.228 --> 31:01.361
Oh, you just said
that he reached in

31:01.363 --> 31:03.363
with his left hand
to grab the keys,

31:03.365 --> 31:05.866
so... he must have
been holding the gun

31:05.868 --> 31:07.301
in his right hand,
is that correct?

31:07.303 --> 31:09.269
I... I guess.

31:09.271 --> 31:12.873
So Granderson shot your husband
with his non-dominant hand?

31:12.875 --> 31:15.142
I-I, I don't... Look,

31:15.144 --> 31:17.344
everything happened so fast.

31:17.346 --> 31:20.714
I-I don't even know

31:20.716 --> 31:22.149
what I know.

31:22.151 --> 31:23.917
I probably blocked
the whole thing out.

31:23.919 --> 31:26.053
You have to understand.

31:26.055 --> 31:28.322
(crying)

31:29.491 --> 31:33.427
(sniffles) My husband's blood
was all over me.

31:33.429 --> 31:35.262
Pieces of his brain
in my hair.

31:35.264 --> 31:38.498
Okay. You know, um, we don't
have to do this right now.

31:38.500 --> 31:40.534
I'm sorry. I...
No, no, no, no, no.

31:40.536 --> 31:43.103
You're still grieving.
And we can do this another time.

31:43.105 --> 31:45.138
(sobbing)

31:45.140 --> 31:47.808
I... I'll just
let myself out, okay?

31:47.810 --> 31:49.977
(crying)

31:58.921 --> 31:59.953
So?

31:59.955 --> 32:01.321
How'd it go?

32:01.323 --> 32:04.491
Like Sarah Palin fielding
foreign policy questions.

32:04.493 --> 32:06.626
You know, I-I always thought
that poor girl

32:06.628 --> 32:08.028
got a bad rap, you know that?

32:08.030 --> 32:09.329
That's great, Anthony.

32:09.331 --> 32:11.331
Is Louise making a call?

32:11.333 --> 32:13.834
She's making one right now.

32:15.471 --> 32:17.871
She is on the move.

32:18.874 --> 32:20.774
Stay down.

32:20.776 --> 32:23.710
♪ ♪

32:42.031 --> 32:44.197
Okay.

32:44.199 --> 32:47.567
Why are we here
and where is she going?

32:47.569 --> 32:50.570
(shutter snapping)
You got who she's on with yet?

32:50.572 --> 32:52.939
I don't have a name yet.

32:55.477 --> 32:58.378
ERIN:
Uh, who is this guy?

32:59.882 --> 33:01.281
ANTHONY:
Could be anybody.

33:01.283 --> 33:03.350
Maybe it's her brother.

33:03.352 --> 33:05.352
(Erin scoffs)
(camera shutter snapping)

33:05.354 --> 33:07.587
I hope that's not her brother.

33:07.589 --> 33:09.256
(computer beeps)

33:09.258 --> 33:11.324
ANTHONY:
Well, look at you, golden gut.

33:11.326 --> 33:13.560
What is it?

33:13.562 --> 33:15.929
Mystery man's number
just popped.

33:15.931 --> 33:18.398
His name is Richard Hart.

33:18.400 --> 33:20.367
He's in the system.

33:20.369 --> 33:21.968
Two-time loser.

33:21.970 --> 33:24.871
Both felonies. Aggravated
assault, attempted murder

33:24.873 --> 33:26.840
with a .38 snub nose.

33:26.842 --> 33:28.642
That's our guy.

33:30.813 --> 33:32.446
Maybe.

33:32.448 --> 33:34.781
You know it is.

33:34.783 --> 33:36.883
I also know that O.J. did it.

33:36.885 --> 33:39.186
Lot of good that did
my bank account.

33:39.188 --> 33:41.822
You bet on the O.J. verdict?

33:41.824 --> 33:43.423
What, you didn't?

33:43.425 --> 33:46.460
You're a really strange guy,
you know that?

33:46.462 --> 33:49.062
Tell me something
I don't already know.

33:49.064 --> 33:51.731
Well, O.J. got off
because Marcia Clark didn't know

33:51.733 --> 33:54.334
how to squeeze the Juice.

34:09.726 --> 34:12.194
Hi. Thanks for
coming down. Please,

34:12.196 --> 34:14.663
have a seat.

34:14.665 --> 34:17.299
You know, uh,
I've been thinking about

34:17.301 --> 34:20.302
what you said about what hand
Granderson used and all.

34:20.304 --> 34:23.103
I think I was right
the first time. He reached in

34:23.106 --> 34:26.174
with his right hand, and
he shot Victor with his left.

34:26.176 --> 34:28.543
Great. That's great.

34:28.545 --> 34:30.212
That's... very helpful.

34:32.416 --> 34:37.284
Can you tell me who...
Richard Hart is?

34:41.123 --> 34:43.123
What?

34:43.126 --> 34:45.226
Who is Richard Hart?

34:45.228 --> 34:49.130
I don't... I don't know anyone
by that name.

34:49.132 --> 34:51.032
That's interesting.

34:51.034 --> 34:54.469
Because you make quite
a few phone calls to him.

34:55.639 --> 34:58.840
Okay, I know him,
but he's just a friend.

34:58.842 --> 35:00.141
Yeah.
I think he's your boyfriend.

35:00.143 --> 35:02.444
And for quite some time,
based on those phone records.

35:04.948 --> 35:07.315
Oh, God.

35:08.185 --> 35:09.851
Okay.

35:09.853 --> 35:11.653
Yes, he's someone
I've been involved with.

35:11.655 --> 35:13.288
Look, I'm not proud of it.

35:13.290 --> 35:16.024
Which is why you never told
this office or the police?

35:16.026 --> 35:17.726
I knew how it would come across.

35:17.728 --> 35:20.228
Husband is shot dead
and wife is having an affair.

35:20.230 --> 35:22.264
I mean, we all know
what that would look like.

35:22.266 --> 35:25.667
Like you had your husband killed
so you can start a new life.

35:26.503 --> 35:29.170
That is not what happened.

35:29.172 --> 35:31.439
I think it is.

35:32.276 --> 35:34.643
Okay.

35:34.645 --> 35:36.711
I think I need a lawyer.

35:36.713 --> 35:38.380
Yeah.

35:38.382 --> 35:40.382
That's probably a good idea.

35:40.384 --> 35:43.685
But the truth is...

35:45.155 --> 35:47.822
...I think it's
a little late for that.

35:47.824 --> 35:49.858
Oh, no.

35:52.195 --> 35:56.765
Yeah, bad move getting involved
with a two-time felon.

35:56.767 --> 36:00.869
See, one more felony conviction
and Richie goes away for life.

36:00.871 --> 36:02.537
Unless he cooperates.

36:02.539 --> 36:05.173
Richie loves me.
He wouldn't say a thing.

36:05.175 --> 36:07.676
Yeah.

36:07.678 --> 36:09.844
He said everything.

36:09.846 --> 36:11.713
About how you two
carried out the murder

36:11.715 --> 36:13.181
of your beloved Victor,

36:13.183 --> 36:15.350
as well as killing Robin Dunn,

36:15.352 --> 36:16.952
the only eyewitness

36:16.954 --> 36:19.588
that could contradict
your testimony.

36:19.590 --> 36:21.523
(gasping):
Wait. Wait.

36:21.525 --> 36:24.426
This was all Richie's idea.
I will tell you

36:24.428 --> 36:25.527
anything you need
to know.

36:25.529 --> 36:27.095
Yeah. He thought
you might say that.

36:27.097 --> 36:28.563
Which is why he
was smart enough

36:28.565 --> 36:30.832
to record
all your phone conversations.

36:33.670 --> 36:35.403
You're under arrest.

36:46.383 --> 36:48.283
You got my money?

36:48.285 --> 36:51.152
(quietly):
Lower your voice.

36:51.154 --> 36:52.354
That's two G's.

36:52.356 --> 36:53.989
Be here same time
next week.

36:53.991 --> 36:55.223
No way. We out.

36:55.225 --> 36:57.459
What do you mean out?
Job isn't done.

36:57.461 --> 36:59.961
Too much heat. There's cops
all over the block now.

36:59.963 --> 37:02.664
A deal's a deal.
Two grand a week, every week,

37:02.666 --> 37:04.432
until the old bastards get
the message

37:04.434 --> 37:06.468
and start moving out
of my buildings.

37:10.774 --> 37:11.906
Police.

37:12.509 --> 37:13.408
You're under arrest.

37:13.410 --> 37:14.676
Get up.
Hands behind your back.

37:14.678 --> 37:15.877
Oh, I didn't do anything.

37:15.879 --> 37:17.946
You little punk.

37:17.948 --> 37:19.748
(handcuffs rattling)

37:21.151 --> 37:22.784
(handcuffs clicking)

37:24.554 --> 37:25.553
Manny.

37:25.555 --> 37:27.489
Commissioner.

37:27.491 --> 37:29.124
I know you have
more than a full plate.

37:29.126 --> 37:30.492
I can't thank you
enough for coming down.

37:30.494 --> 37:31.960
Oh, of course I came.

37:31.962 --> 37:33.995
Olivia and I both hate that
we've imposed on you this way.

37:33.997 --> 37:35.430
Oh, nonsense.

37:35.432 --> 37:38.299
Gives me a chance to get a jump
on recruiting the...

37:38.301 --> 37:39.634
boy or girl?

37:39.636 --> 37:41.670
Boy.

37:41.672 --> 37:43.838
You have a son.

37:43.840 --> 37:45.940
Congratulations.

37:45.942 --> 37:47.275
Thank you.

37:47.277 --> 37:48.843
Would you like to meet him?

37:48.845 --> 37:50.412
I'd love to.

37:50.414 --> 37:53.048
(baby fussing)

37:53.050 --> 37:55.283
Commissioner.
Congratulations.

37:55.285 --> 37:57.619
Thank you.

37:57.621 --> 38:00.388
Lucky for you,
he got his mother's good looks.

38:00.390 --> 38:02.057
Would you like to hold him?

38:02.059 --> 38:04.559
Oh, no, I'm a little
out of practice.

38:04.561 --> 38:07.495
No, please.

38:07.497 --> 38:09.698
Okay.

38:11.001 --> 38:12.233
Okay.

38:13.737 --> 38:15.704
(grunts)

38:17.140 --> 38:18.907
(chuckles)

38:21.511 --> 38:22.944
What's his name?

38:22.946 --> 38:25.780
We'd like to name him after you.

38:29.753 --> 38:31.686
Francis.

38:31.688 --> 38:34.522
Just Francis, though.

38:34.524 --> 38:37.726
Not Francis Xavier.

38:40.664 --> 38:42.997
One piece of advice.

38:42.999 --> 38:44.966
Please.

38:44.968 --> 38:48.269
With a name
like Francis Francisco,

38:48.271 --> 38:52.006
you better teach him
how to throw a left hook.

38:52.008 --> 38:54.209
Okay?

38:58.949 --> 39:01.716
Oh, you came to see the baby.
How sweet of you.

39:01.718 --> 39:03.251
Actually, I came to see you.

39:03.253 --> 39:05.687
The mayor's office called.
A gap opened up in his schedule.

39:05.689 --> 39:07.388
And I need to know this, why?

39:07.390 --> 39:08.723
He's inviting you up.

39:08.725 --> 39:09.858
Uh-huh.

39:09.860 --> 39:12.060
You're clear for the next hour.
So, weeks

39:12.062 --> 39:14.796
go by and then I get called in
on ten minutes' notice?

39:14.798 --> 39:16.865
Don't look at it like that.
Oh, come on, Garrett.

39:16.867 --> 39:18.700
How long do you think
you can do this?

39:18.702 --> 39:21.603
I... don't know.

39:21.605 --> 39:23.905
Look, Garrett,

39:23.907 --> 39:26.040
I'm closer to the end
than the beginning.

39:26.042 --> 39:28.042
So, some of this stuff,

39:28.044 --> 39:31.079
I just don't have it in me
to care anymore.

39:31.081 --> 39:33.281
About the job?

39:33.283 --> 39:36.618
No. I care about the job.

39:36.620 --> 39:38.052
It's the rest of it.

39:38.054 --> 39:42.690
The posturing, the little digs,
the wasting my time.

39:42.692 --> 39:46.594
What do you want me
to tell them?

39:46.596 --> 39:49.063
(sighs)

39:49.065 --> 39:50.198
Tell them I'll stay on

39:50.200 --> 39:52.300
until the mayor gets his head
out of his ass.

39:52.302 --> 39:54.335
(elevator bell dings)

39:54.337 --> 39:56.471
So, indefinitely.

39:56.473 --> 39:59.107
But if anybody asks me
what indefinitely means...

39:59.109 --> 40:01.042
They better duck?
Exactly.
