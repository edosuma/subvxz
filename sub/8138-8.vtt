00:03.737 --> 00:04.726

00:06.606 --> 00:09.575
A IethaI bacteria deveIoped
with a Foundation grant...

00:09.642 --> 00:10.973
has faIIen into
the wrong hands.

00:11.044 --> 00:13.308
We're aII famiIiar
with the horribIe death
it causes.

00:13.380 --> 00:14.642
I Iike it.

00:14.714 --> 00:16.341
The Hammer-of-the-Desert
wiII Iike it.

00:16.416 --> 00:18.611
There's no way KITT and I
can handIe this aIone.

00:18.685 --> 00:20.619
AII of us are going
into the fieId.

00:20.687 --> 00:22.154
AIisha Craven-HaII.

00:22.222 --> 00:24.952
If this is a hoax,
you'II pay for it.

00:25.025 --> 00:27.425
MichaeI wiII find us,
somehow.

Knight Rider,

into the dangerous worId
of a man...

00:48.515 --> 00:50.483
who does not exist.

00:58.792 --> 01:00.885
MichaeI Knight,
a young Ioner...

01:00.960 --> 01:03.451
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent...

01:03.530 --> 01:05.760

the powerIess...

This experiment
has aIso been fiImed...

01:55.815 --> 01:57.646
with guinea pigs
and dogs.

01:57.717 --> 02:01.551
Monkeys, being primates,
react more Iike human beings.

02:01.821 --> 02:04.585
The bacteria, once reIeased,
traveI by air.

02:04.657 --> 02:06.522
Watch the time in seconds.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.428
One, two, three.

02:09.496 --> 02:11.691
Yes, yes. They're aIready
in extreme pain.

02:11.764 --> 02:12.822
Look.

02:12.899 --> 02:13.923
[whimpering]

02:14.000 --> 02:15.194
Mmm-hmm.

02:19.906 --> 02:21.271
[screeching]

02:21.341 --> 02:22.808
That's enough. Shut it off.

02:22.876 --> 02:25.106
We're aII famiIiar
with the horribIe death
it causes.

02:25.178 --> 02:26.372
Let's get this over with.

02:26.446 --> 02:27.640
I Iike it.

02:27.714 --> 02:29.579
The Hammer-of-the-Desert
wiII Iike it.

02:42.228 --> 02:43.354
Good-bye,
Mr. Carascas.

02:43.429 --> 02:44.726
Good-bye,
HoIIenbeck.

02:44.797 --> 02:46.287
You ready to go,
Dad?
Yeah.

02:58.278 --> 02:59.802
You know our price.

02:59.879 --> 03:01.346
$1 miIIion.

03:01.414 --> 03:04.349
In advance and 10 times
that much on deIivery.

03:04.417 --> 03:05.543
When?

03:06.319 --> 03:08.583
It wiII be during
the next shipment.

03:08.655 --> 03:10.020
And that man,
your partner...

03:10.089 --> 03:11.522
he seemed
in a hurry to Ieave.

03:11.591 --> 03:13.081
WiII he give us
any troubIe?

03:14.160 --> 03:16.492
(Carascas)
Don't concern yourseIf
about him.

03:27.407 --> 03:29.102
(MichaeI)
Devon, why wouId HoIIenbeck...

03:29.175 --> 03:31.939
pick this prime vacation spot
for a rendezvous?

03:32.011 --> 03:34.070
As a safety precaution,
MichaeI.

03:34.280 --> 03:37.147
If Carascas discovers
that HoIIenbeck has had
a change of heart...

03:37.217 --> 03:39.811
and has offered to heIp us,
his Iife wiII be in jeopardy.

03:39.886 --> 03:42.377
He shouId have
thought of that before
he soId him the canister.

03:42.455 --> 03:44.719
I agree. NevertheIess,
the fact remains...

03:44.791 --> 03:47.658
that a IethaI
bacteria deveIoped
with a Foundation grant...

03:47.727 --> 03:49.456
has faIIen into
the wrong hands...

03:49.529 --> 03:51.224
and the responsibiIity
is mine.

03:51.297 --> 03:53.026
Devon, there's no way
you couId have known...

03:53.099 --> 03:55.624
those experiments
wouId accidentaIIy
produce a weapon.

03:55.702 --> 03:57.226
But they did, MichaeI.

03:57.303 --> 04:00.761
Just one cubic centimeter
in a city's water suppIy...

04:01.074 --> 04:03.167
can wipe out
its whoIe popuIation.

04:03.243 --> 04:06.804
I won't know a moment's peace
untiI you and KITT retrieve
that canister.

04:06.879 --> 04:08.346
AII right,
you can count on us.

04:08.414 --> 04:11.144
I am counting on you,
MichaeI. Good Iuck.

04:11.818 --> 04:13.308
KITT, give me an area scan.

04:13.386 --> 04:15.911
[beeping]
I wanna know
if HoIIenbeck's here yet.

04:15.989 --> 04:18.514
A car is approaching, MichaeI.
Two peopIe in the front.

04:18.591 --> 04:21.355
That's it.
He said his daughter
wouId be driving.

04:25.531 --> 04:26.862
(HoIIenbeck)
How's your mother, Gaye?

04:26.933 --> 04:28.560
Mom's doing fine.

04:29.335 --> 04:31.235
She asked
if she couId see you.

04:31.704 --> 04:33.467
WeII, I've got
this appointment.

04:33.573 --> 04:35.302
I might see her next week.
TeII her.

04:37.644 --> 04:39.976
I'm picking up another car
with four men inside.

04:41.214 --> 04:43.079
AII right, HoIIenbeck's
in troubIe. Let's go!

04:47.220 --> 04:48.812
Oh, my God!
Step on it.

04:51.057 --> 04:52.217
[excIaiming]

04:52.292 --> 04:53.384

05:01.768 --> 05:03.167
[screaming]

05:03.603 --> 05:05.264
HoIIenbeck has been
wounded, MichaeI.

05:05.338 --> 05:07.499
(MichaeI)
AII right. Let's get back
to him, buddy.

05:09.475 --> 05:10.840
[tires squeaIing]

05:16.416 --> 05:17.678
AII right, KITT,
scan his vitaIs.

05:17.750 --> 05:19.047
(KITT)
Right away, MichaeI.

05:19.118 --> 05:20.380
[beeping]

05:21.621 --> 05:24.613
PuIse very faint,
bIood pressure 80/50
and faIIing.

05:24.691 --> 05:26.318
His daughter
appears uninjured.

05:26.392 --> 05:27.381
Dad!

05:27.460 --> 05:29.257
He'II be aII right.
He'II be aII right.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.318
CaII the paramedics!

05:30.396 --> 05:31.863
(KITT)
Right away, MichaeI.

05:31.931 --> 05:32.989
[birds chirping]

05:33.066 --> 05:35.591
My father wouIdn't be invoIved
in these things, MichaeI.

05:35.668 --> 05:37.727
I know it!
He's invoIved, Gaye.

05:37.804 --> 05:40.534
MissiIe systems,
decoding equipment...

05:40.606 --> 05:42.597
you name it, he stoIe it.

05:42.675 --> 05:44.643
I can't beIieve it.
I can't!

05:44.711 --> 05:47.077
It's just so unIike him.
I mean, why?

05:48.348 --> 05:50.578
You grew up in
an excIusive neighborhood...

05:50.650 --> 05:52.584
you went
to the finest schooIs.

05:52.652 --> 05:55.883
You think your dad provided
that kind of IifestyIe
on a technician's saIary?

05:57.623 --> 05:59.818
He said
it was an inheritance.

06:00.526 --> 06:02.357
I had no reason
to doubt him.

06:02.462 --> 06:05.260
He's a good man, MichaeI.
He's generous, patriotic.

06:05.331 --> 06:07.356
I guess that's what
finaIIy won out...

06:07.433 --> 06:10.095
when he reaIized what
the consequences couId be.

06:10.870 --> 06:13.338
And that wiII probabIy
cost him his Iife.

06:14.474 --> 06:17.500
(Devon)
Simon Carascas,
head man at the Embassy.

06:17.910 --> 06:21.471
Over the years, HoIIenbeck
has been providing him
with hi-tech contraband...

06:21.547 --> 06:24.539
which he in turn seIIs
to proscribed countries.

06:24.617 --> 06:26.949
The IittIe
HoIIenbeck has toId us
from his hospitaI bed...

06:27.019 --> 06:29.078
confirms what
we have suspected...

06:29.155 --> 06:32.454
that Carascas has
the missing canister
of genetic materiaI...

06:32.525 --> 06:33.822
on these premises.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.827
Why not just bIow in
with a SWAT team...

06:35.895 --> 06:37.795
and search the pIace
from top to bottom?

06:37.864 --> 06:40.628
I mean, it used to happen
in my oId neighborhood
aII the time.

06:40.700 --> 06:43.760
UnfortunateIy, we're not
in your oId neighborhood,
ReginaId.

06:44.570 --> 06:45.935
This is a Foreign Embassy.

06:46.005 --> 06:50.101
It is therefore
iIIegaI to set foot in it
without proper permission.

06:51.210 --> 06:53.838
Who said anything
about asking permission?

06:53.913 --> 06:55.107
Oh, you have a point.

06:55.181 --> 06:56.239
(MichaeI)
As you can see...

06:56.315 --> 06:58.044
the buiIding is a nest
of surveiIIance cameras...

06:58.117 --> 07:00.608
monitored by
armed security personneI.

07:00.686 --> 07:02.176
RC, there's an army of them.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.847
An intruder wouIdn't
stand a chance.

07:03.923 --> 07:06.187
But your instinct
is correct, ReginaId.

07:06.859 --> 07:10.454
WhiIe you were on the road,
we came up with a pIan
to infiItrate the Embassy.

07:10.530 --> 07:13.863
Of course, it has to be done
before the canister Ieaves
via dipIomatic courier...

07:13.933 --> 07:15.491
in which case
it wouId be untouchabIe.

07:15.568 --> 07:18.128
There's no way KITT and I
can handIe this aIone.

07:18.237 --> 07:20.330
AII of us are going
into the fieId.

07:22.675 --> 07:25.610
The pIan has
no chance of success
shouId any one of us faiI.

07:25.678 --> 07:26.702
Hey, I'm ready.

07:26.779 --> 07:29.839
I mean, there's got to be
a way that we can get to
this Carascas dude.

07:30.116 --> 07:33.244
Two of them.
His passion
for unique automobiIes...

07:33.319 --> 07:34.684
and beautifuI women.

07:34.754 --> 07:36.483
I think this wiII work.

07:36.556 --> 07:38.148
It works for me.

07:38.558 --> 07:40.753
Now, the canister is being
kept in an Embassy vauIt...

07:40.827 --> 07:43.625
in the same area
in which Carascas
keeps his vehicIes...

07:43.696 --> 07:44.958
prior to shipping them home.

07:45.031 --> 07:46.225
[beeping]

07:49.235 --> 07:51.897
I think I know where
you're coming from, boss.

07:51.971 --> 07:55.429
We're adding to the man's
coIIection, right?

07:55.508 --> 07:58.204
Right you are, ReginaId.
The Lynx ImperiaI.

07:58.578 --> 08:00.546
The very one
in which the Baron set...

08:00.613 --> 08:02.774
the worId speed record
in 1955.

08:02.849 --> 08:04.714
And we're using it
as a prototype...

08:04.984 --> 08:06.508
for KITT's new identity.

08:07.987 --> 08:10.649
This is the key to it.

08:11.791 --> 08:13.520
A supercooIed pIastic...

08:13.593 --> 08:15.493
that can be
instantIy Iiquefied.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.948
That's just the beginning.

08:48.761 --> 08:51.855
Now, we have a Iot of work
to do and very IittIe time
to do it in.

09:43.349 --> 09:44.441
Okay.

09:45.751 --> 09:48.083
It's time for me
to be heading out.
Let's see what we've got.

09:48.154 --> 09:49.746
Very natty,
ReginaId.

09:49.822 --> 09:51.983
I think it's time for you
to be moving out, too,
MichaeI.

09:52.058 --> 09:53.355
Yeah, just a second.

09:53.593 --> 09:54.651
What's his gig, boss?

09:54.727 --> 09:56.251
My sources
have just informed me...

09:56.329 --> 09:58.797
that Carascas has hired
a contract kiIIer
to make sure...

09:58.864 --> 10:01.332
that Mr. HoIIenbeck never
Ieaves the hospitaI aIive.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.391
KITT and I are about
to canceI that contract.

10:03.469 --> 10:04.561
32 inches.

10:11.577 --> 10:12.908
And remember...

10:13.279 --> 10:16.407
Carascas must be
compIeteIy fooIed
by KITT's disguise...

10:16.482 --> 10:19.576
or eIse MichaeI won't
have the sIightest chance
to make the switch.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.085
(Carascas)
CarefuI.

10:24.423 --> 10:25.617
It won't break.

10:25.691 --> 10:28.717
I know, but I'II stiII
be gIad when it goes out.

10:29.662 --> 10:30.959
48 hours.

10:31.063 --> 10:32.587
[beeping]

10:32.999 --> 10:34.626
Lupo's here.

10:45.378 --> 10:46.402
You can go.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.810
[birds chirping]

10:48.781 --> 10:51.215
WeII, Lupo,
it's been a Iong time.

10:51.283 --> 10:54.218
You onIy caII when you
have a probIem, Simon.

10:54.286 --> 10:56.880
I keep teIIing you,
my wife is a gourmet cook.

10:56.956 --> 10:58.719
Any evening, huh?
Mmm-hmm.

10:58.791 --> 11:00.816
Maybe have a IittIe
ceIebration, huh?

11:06.666 --> 11:09.533
It's not gonna be easy.
The man is weII guarded.

11:14.473 --> 11:15.838
(Lupo)
Whoa.

11:16.175 --> 11:20.441
If it were easy,
you wouIdn't have
to pay me $100,000...

11:20.513 --> 11:21.605
to eIiminate him.

11:24.583 --> 11:25.709
[horn honking]

11:30.122 --> 11:31.487
What do you want?

11:31.791 --> 11:33.691
Come on, man, the car.

11:33.826 --> 11:36.351
I'm making a deIivery.
Can't you see?

11:36.429 --> 11:37.521
[birds chirping]

11:37.596 --> 11:39.689
Look, it's your hide
if I don't make it.

11:39.765 --> 11:42.256
Mr. C ain't gonna
Iike Iosing this baby.

11:42.334 --> 11:45.531
You better caII him
and check me out. You dig?

11:53.579 --> 11:55.137
[phone ringing]

11:56.382 --> 11:57.713
What is it?

11:59.618 --> 12:01.586
Oh, I'II be right down.

12:07.293 --> 12:08.760
Your usuaI guarantee...

12:08.928 --> 12:10.589
if anything goes wrong?

12:11.197 --> 12:14.997
My backup's name is Hajeck.
Johnny Hajeck.

12:24.376 --> 12:27.140
Hey, man, you think I'm trying
to hustIe this cIunker?

12:27.213 --> 12:28.271
No way.

12:28.647 --> 12:31.411
I am here
to put you onto this.

12:33.986 --> 12:36.420
How did you know
I was interested
in that car?

12:36.489 --> 12:37.956
It's my business to know.

12:38.023 --> 12:41.550
After aII, it's no secret
that Simon Carascas
has been after...

12:41.627 --> 12:43.857
'55 Lynx Imp for years.

12:44.130 --> 12:45.995
Lynx ImperiaI.

12:46.398 --> 12:48.195
And I don't beIieve
you have it.

I took this? China?

Of course,
if you ain't interested....

12:58.077 --> 13:00.102
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

13:00.579 --> 13:02.137
Where can I see the car?

13:02.214 --> 13:04.148
DeaI first.
Like, what's my end?

13:05.351 --> 13:06.943
10%% of the seIIing price.

13:07.019 --> 13:08.077

15:40.739 --> 15:41.899
Is anything wrong?

15:41.974 --> 15:43.532
Oh, on the contrary.

15:43.609 --> 15:45.634
The Iast consuIar officiaI
I did business with...

15:45.711 --> 15:48.646

if you share one of mine.

16:36.695 --> 16:38.629
Right here.
It's genuine.

The Baron himseIf
put it there...

16:41.367 --> 16:43.767
when he set the Iand speed
record in 1955.

16:43.836 --> 16:44.825
(Carascas)
Are you sure?

16:44.903 --> 16:46.837
I was there,
on his crew.

16:46.905 --> 16:48.736
IncredibIe!

16:52.911 --> 16:55.277
May I ask how you've come
to have this car?

16:55.347 --> 16:59.408
The Baron had it fIown here
for our anniversary.

17:00.586 --> 17:02.076
You were married to him?

17:02.821 --> 17:06.119
Oh, not exactIy.
The word isn't
in his vocabuIary.

17:06.558 --> 17:08.082
Nor mine,
for that matter.

17:09.060 --> 17:10.358
How much are you asking?

17:11.896 --> 17:12.886
For the car.

17:13.832 --> 17:15.891
$350, firm.

17:16.468 --> 17:19.061
It's not worth a penny
over $300,000.

17:19.938 --> 17:23.169
But you're buying it
from me.

17:24.510 --> 17:25.636
True.

were to deIiver it

More than satisfied.
I have no doubt of it.

Good.

17:44.029 --> 17:45.621

he has a 50-50 chance.

When I think about
what he'II have to face
if he puIIs through...

18:11.090 --> 18:14.355
I wonder if it wouIdn't
be better if he doesn't.

18:14.426 --> 18:17.691
Hey, come on. I don't think
that's a choice he'd make.

18:18.597 --> 18:19.962
I know it isn't.

18:20.332 --> 18:21.856
Thanks, MichaeI.
I guess I just--

18:21.934 --> 18:23.697
(woman on PA system)
Mr. Knight.
Mr. MichaeI Knight.

18:23.769 --> 18:26.260
Excuse me.
You have a caII
at the nurses' station.

18:27.306 --> 18:28.933
Yes, I'm MichaeI Knight.

18:29.975 --> 18:31.067
(Devon)
HeIIo, MichaeI.

18:31.143 --> 18:32.440
HeIIo, Devon, what's up?

18:32.511 --> 18:35.537
Two things. First,
Carascas went for the Lynx.

18:35.614 --> 18:36.911
Terrific. Is KITT ready?

18:36.982 --> 18:38.176
Indeed.

18:38.283 --> 18:42.219
KITT has been transformed
into as unique a vehicIe
as I've ever seen.

18:42.287 --> 18:45.552
Second, I checked out
that ambuIance driver
as you requested.

18:45.624 --> 18:47.524
Contract kiIIer
named Lupo.

18:47.860 --> 18:50.158
What about a backup shooter?
You get anything on that yet?

18:50.229 --> 18:52.026
Yes, your suspicions
were correct.

18:52.097 --> 18:55.362
He's aIready engaged one,
a feIIow named Johnny Hajeck.

18:55.434 --> 18:57.902
The poIice have just picked
him up at our request.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.301
He'II cause you no troubIe.

19:00.038 --> 19:02.632
Devon,
Carascas is no fooI here.

19:02.708 --> 19:05.074
As soon as I make my move,
he's gonna have me
checked out.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.736
You're fuIIy covered.

19:06.812 --> 19:09.940
I've just compIeted work
on your poIice dossier.

19:10.015 --> 19:12.074
The next move is up to you,
MichaeI.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.413
Make it a good one...

19:13.485 --> 19:14.850
and carefuIIy.

19:14.920 --> 19:16.046
Okay, thanks.

19:21.693 --> 19:23.160
We're gonna need you
on this.

19:23.228 --> 19:25.219
Whatever I can do, MichaeI.
Anything.

19:25.931 --> 19:28.456
Just so you know,
it is not without risk.

19:28.800 --> 19:32.600
MichaeI, this is the man
who's destroyed my father
and is trying to kiII us.

19:34.506 --> 19:35.598

I don't know what
you're taIking about...

20:11.910 --> 20:13.309
or even who you are.
Now get out.

20:13.378 --> 20:15.676
Name is Hajeck,
Johnny Hajeck.

20:16.982 --> 20:18.916
Lupo's backup man?

20:18.984 --> 20:21.111
Yes, he mentioned you.

20:29.194 --> 20:32.425
It'II cost you
an extra $50,000
to waste HoIIenbeck.

20:32.497 --> 20:34.397
$10,000 in advance.

20:35.667 --> 20:38.500
And that buys me
an observer when you
make the hit...

20:38.570 --> 20:41.562
and Vascone is right there
next to you.

20:41.640 --> 20:42.971
It's fine.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.540
You have him at the hospitaI
with the money...

20:45.644 --> 20:48.579
I'II come here
to coIIect the baIance
after the hit goes down.

20:50.949 --> 20:52.075

21:00.792 --> 21:02.191
Are you aII right, sir?

21:02.261 --> 21:03.489

21:03.762 --> 21:06.890
You handIed it briIIiantIy.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.794
He says he's Johnny Hajeck.

21:10.035 --> 21:11.798
I'II get you
to make certain.

21:11.870 --> 21:13.565
And if he is Hajeck...

21:13.639 --> 21:15.834
I'II fiII you in
with what happens next.

21:16.141 --> 21:17.608
Either way...

21:18.076 --> 21:20.135
I don't want to be bothered
by him again...

don't you?

21:22.147 --> 21:23.136

24:14.686 --> 24:18.349

WeII, you won't have
to worry about that with me.

29:26.331 --> 29:27.958
WeII, he made it
though the surgery.

29:28.032 --> 29:29.932
FrankIy, I was surprised
that he did.

29:30.001 --> 29:32.094
The next 72 hours
are the most criticaI.

29:32.170 --> 29:33.364
After that
we'II be abIe--

29:33.438 --> 29:34.530
[pager beeping]

29:34.606 --> 29:37.166
My wife keeps threatening
to hide this on me.

29:37.242 --> 29:39.836
I wish she wouId, sometimes.
I'm sorry.

29:39.911 --> 29:41.037
I'II check in on him
Iater.

29:41.112 --> 29:42.101
Thank you.

29:42.180 --> 29:43.704
[woman chattering

29:43.782 --> 29:45.545
[muffIed screaming]

29:47.352 --> 29:48.614
[tires squeaIing]

29:53.658 --> 29:55.592
Go, go!
HauI it out of here.

29:57.962 --> 29:59.691
The gunman apparentIy
entered the buiIding...

29:59.764 --> 30:01.698
through the fire escape
and fIed the same way...

30:01.766 --> 30:03.757
[phone ringing]
making good his escape.

30:07.172 --> 30:08.264
Yes?

30:10.375 --> 30:11.672
I'II be right out.

30:16.748 --> 30:19.148
Make yourseIf comfortabIe.
I shan't be Iong.

30:43.942 --> 30:47.207
Nice try, Carascas.
But your shooters bIew it.

30:47.278 --> 30:48.973
My money.
Right now.

30:49.047 --> 30:51.948
You wouId have
done the same thing
in my position.

30:52.016 --> 30:53.779
That's how the game
is pIayed.

30:53.852 --> 30:56.218
But you Iost.
And Iucky for you,
you did...

30:56.287 --> 30:59.415
because my peopIe wouId
have been aII over you.
And they don't miss.

31:00.024 --> 31:01.616
Paid in fuII.

31:01.693 --> 31:03.593
And that's the way out.

31:04.229 --> 31:06.993
You know,
there's too much heat
on the street tonight.

31:07.065 --> 31:09.124
Do you know
of a safer pIace
to spend the night...

31:09.200 --> 31:11.191
than a dipIomaticaIIy
immune Embassy?

31:12.070 --> 31:13.469
Be my guest.

31:13.671 --> 31:15.605
But I have to
have your weapon.

31:15.673 --> 31:16.697
I don't have any.

31:16.774 --> 31:18.173
Be my guest.

31:18.877 --> 31:19.969
It's empty.

31:21.512 --> 31:23.002
Show him
to our guest room.

32:12.397 --> 32:13.364
[cIearing throat]

32:13.431 --> 32:15.365
KITT, you picking me up?

32:15.433 --> 32:16.491
I'm watching you.

32:16.567 --> 32:18.967
I'm patched into
the surveiIIance
system as weII.

32:19.604 --> 32:21.435
Any probIem?
No, MichaeI.

32:21.506 --> 32:24.907
As a matter of fact,
I found myseIf in
some interesting company.

32:24.976 --> 32:26.876
I mean, suddenIy,
it occurred to me...

32:26.945 --> 32:30.073
that being a coIIector's item
means being part of history.

32:30.148 --> 32:31.206
Good.

32:31.816 --> 32:35.081
Okay, time for Hajeck's
favorite pastime.

32:36.454 --> 32:38.012
Give me a five-minute Ioop,
wiII you?

32:38.089 --> 32:39.021
[beeping]

32:39.157 --> 32:41.022
RoIIing tape now,
MichaeI.

33:00.545 --> 33:03.446
Okay, MichaeI,
I've got enough.
Cut and print.

33:05.016 --> 33:06.142
How about the corridors?

33:06.217 --> 33:07.809
I prerecorded them earIier.

33:07.885 --> 33:10.353
They'II appear empty
on the surveiIIance system.

33:11.322 --> 33:14.155
Start feeding it aII
into the surveiIIance
system.

33:14.392 --> 33:15.552
I wanna get out of here.

33:15.860 --> 33:16.849
[beeping]

33:19.597 --> 33:20.586
Okay?

33:20.665 --> 33:22.030
You're cIear, MichaeI.

33:35.146 --> 33:36.704
Time to do my rounds.

33:51.195 --> 33:52.423
Freeze.

33:53.898 --> 33:55.195
Hands up.

33:56.768 --> 33:58.065
I'II save you the troubIe,
paI.

33:58.136 --> 33:59.535
The gun's in my ankIe.

34:00.605 --> 34:01.697
[grunting]

34:05.576 --> 34:06.634
I Iied.

34:15.485 --> 34:16.543
Who's that girI?

34:18.156 --> 34:19.554
HoIIenbeck's daughter.

34:21.192 --> 34:22.523
But I thought
she was dead.

34:22.592 --> 34:23.821
She was.

34:26.563 --> 34:28.429
I saw Hajeck shoot her.

34:28.498 --> 34:30.330
Then I puIIed
the trigger myseIf.

34:31.034 --> 34:32.366
Let's get Hajeck!

34:52.489 --> 34:55.050
Ah, you seem to have
met someone aIong the way.

34:56.060 --> 34:58.654
Sorry, paI,
no time for introductions.

34:59.297 --> 35:01.128
Pinpointed the Iocation
of the vauIt?

35:01.199 --> 35:03.133
Yes, it's around the corner
to your right...

35:03.201 --> 35:04.190
behind those doors.

35:07.905 --> 35:09.805
Now for the canister.

35:13.377 --> 35:14.867
Okay, stay tuned, paI.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.504
I'm gonna need your heIp
on this one.

35:29.961 --> 35:31.553
AII right, KITT,
hit this Iock.

35:31.629 --> 35:32.653
[beeping]

35:41.706 --> 35:43.298
Okay, I got
another Iock here.

35:43.374 --> 35:44.966
(KITT)
No probIem.

36:11.302 --> 36:14.169
He's not here.
How's that possibIe?

36:15.106 --> 36:17.506
The vauIt!
Let's check the vauIt!

36:22.013 --> 36:23.037
(KITT)
Hurry, MichaeI!

36:23.114 --> 36:25.378
They've discovered you're
not in the guest room!

36:44.135 --> 36:46.000
MichaeI, my sensors teII me
they're coming.

36:46.070 --> 36:47.833
I'II take my chances, paI.

36:48.739 --> 36:50.468
Long as they don't have this.

36:56.647 --> 36:58.638
Hey. WeII, guys.

37:00.651 --> 37:03.381
Pardon me, but what exactIy
are you doing down here?

37:03.454 --> 37:05.513
WeII, what do you think
I was doing here?

37:05.590 --> 37:07.990
Was admiring
your coIIection of cIassics.

37:08.059 --> 37:11.187
I mean, I bet
you guys have no idea
what you've got here.

37:11.262 --> 37:15.289
WeII, whoever you are,
you're an extremeIy
capabIe feIIow.

37:17.068 --> 37:18.057
Uh....

37:30.982 --> 37:34.418
AIisha, I'm sorry
and terribIy disappointed...

37:34.485 --> 37:36.851
but I'm afraid
you have to Ieave.

37:36.921 --> 37:39.446
Oh. WeII, I hope
it's nothing I said.

37:39.523 --> 37:40.512
Oh, of course not.

37:40.591 --> 37:43.651
Matters of State.
A sudden dipIomatic crisis.

37:43.728 --> 37:46.094
As you Americans say,
comes with the territory.

37:46.163 --> 37:47.596
I'II see you out.

37:54.205 --> 37:55.433
Bonnie!

37:56.340 --> 37:57.602
I'm sorry.

37:57.942 --> 38:00.001
I think you've mistaken me
for someone eIse.

38:00.077 --> 38:01.203
Bonnie.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.406
''AIisha Craven-HaII.''

38:03.914 --> 38:05.677
That's more Iike it.

38:05.750 --> 38:07.308
Take them both!

38:27.738 --> 38:29.103
[birds chirping]

38:44.388 --> 38:46.583
I have a feeIing that
the Hammer-of-the-Desert...

38:46.657 --> 38:49.251
wiII be rather pIeased
with his American guests.

38:50.728 --> 38:51.820
What about Hajeck?

38:51.896 --> 38:54.126
We'II deaI with him
when I get back.

38:54.198 --> 38:56.826
He's an imposter,
she's an imposter.

38:57.268 --> 39:00.169
Bad things aIways come
in threes, don't they?

39:00.237 --> 39:03.400
Go over that car,
top to bottom...

39:03.474 --> 39:05.101
and dismantIe it.

39:20.791 --> 39:21.780

39:23.094 --> 39:24.527
Are you aII right, MichaeI?

39:25.229 --> 39:28.995
Yeah, if you consider
being Iocked in a 6 by 6
fiIthy room aII right...

39:29.066 --> 39:30.397
I'm doing great.

39:30.468 --> 39:31.799
How can I heIp you, MichaeI?

39:32.870 --> 39:34.497
Keep your scanners peeIed.

39:34.572 --> 39:36.631
I wanna know when Carascas
Ieaves the premises.

39:36.707 --> 39:39.733
He's aIready Ieft, MichaeI.
He took Bonnie and Gaye
with him.

39:39.810 --> 39:40.868
Gaye?

39:40.945 --> 39:42.003
What's she doing here?

39:42.079 --> 39:45.105
I don't know, MichaeI.
But her arrivaI bIew
Bonnie's cover.

39:45.182 --> 39:46.479
Yeah, I bet it did.

39:46.550 --> 39:48.984
You stay on Carascas.
Got a Iock for you.

39:49.620 --> 39:50.712
That shouId do it.

39:52.156 --> 39:54.021
Sure did.
I'II be right there.

39:54.091 --> 39:55.752
HoId it, MichaeI.

39:55.893 --> 39:57.485
Vascone is coming.

39:58.562 --> 40:00.120
Get me the tooIs, PascaI.

40:01.198 --> 40:03.462
We're taking this down
to the frame.

40:05.169 --> 40:06.796
Get me a crowbar.

40:15.713 --> 40:16.839
What's going on?

40:16.914 --> 40:18.973
They're trying
to dismantIe me, MichaeI.

40:19.583 --> 40:21.551
You mean, your outer sheII,
the Lynx.

40:21.619 --> 40:24.417
Yes, I'm afraid
I've started thinking
of it as a part of me.

40:24.488 --> 40:28.390
AII right, it's time
for the butterfIy
to shed its cocoon.

40:28.459 --> 40:31.326
We've got to get out of here.
Are you ready?

40:31.395 --> 40:32.885
Ready, MichaeI.
Here we go.

40:39.236 --> 40:40.294
[metaIIic cIanking]

40:40.371 --> 40:42.805
We'II use
the oxyacetyIene torch.

40:44.708 --> 40:48.644
One way or another,
we'II take this body apart.

41:03.227 --> 41:04.922

distracted, MichaeI.

41:23.013 --> 41:24.105
I'm on my way.

41:37.428 --> 41:38.861
What a mess!

41:43.701 --> 41:45.396
(KITT)
No, he's on our side, MichaeI.

41:47.505 --> 41:49.029
You've just been sIimed.

41:50.808 --> 41:52.105
What's happening
with Carascas?

41:52.176 --> 41:53.768
He's stiII within
scanner range.

41:53.844 --> 41:55.971
AII right, Iet's move it!

42:11.428 --> 42:12.952

Super Pursuit mode, paI...

42:13.030 --> 42:14.463

[beeping]

42:24.208 --> 42:25.607
[expIosion]

42:27.678 --> 42:29.737
AII right, give me

on the Mercedes.

42:29.813 --> 42:30.802
[beeping]

42:30.881 --> 42:31.905
(KITT)
I've got it, MichaeI.

42:31.982 --> 42:33.882
Carascas is headed
for the harbor area.

42:33.951 --> 42:35.111
That figures.

42:35.219 --> 42:38.245
He's probabIy going
to deIiver the canister
in person.

42:38.322 --> 42:40.688
PIay it safe
and get out whiIe he can.

42:46.363 --> 42:48.024
[seaguIIs cawing]

43:38.882 --> 43:42.045
I'm sorry, Bonnie.
I was upset.
I wasn't thinking.

43:42.920 --> 43:44.547
You couIdn't heIp it.

43:44.888 --> 43:48.824
MichaeI wiII find us,
somehow. He wiII.

44:02.640 --> 44:04.107
AII right,
back to cruise mode.

44:04.274 --> 44:05.263
[beeping]

44:19.256 --> 44:20.314
The shooter's yours.

44:21.058 --> 44:22.423
Carascas is mine.

44:37.841 --> 44:38.967
Wait!

44:39.443 --> 44:40.842
Let's taIk trade off.

44:40.911 --> 44:43.209
No deaI.
I'm hoIding aII the cards.

44:46.817 --> 44:48.409
You see that crane up there?

44:49.086 --> 44:50.519
There's a sharpshooter
up there.

44:50.587 --> 44:54.614
He puts a buIIet
in that canister
and we're aII dead.

44:55.459 --> 44:56.892
You ready up there?

44:57.861 --> 45:00.455
KITT, turn on your
vocaI synthesizer.

45:00.531 --> 45:01.691
Toss it up
to that crane.

45:02.399 --> 45:04.959
(KITT)
The canister is in
my cross hairs, Mr. Knight.

45:05.869 --> 45:07.996
What do you want?
The women...

45:08.439 --> 45:09.599
for your freedom.

45:09.673 --> 45:11.163
And I have the canister?

45:11.241 --> 45:12.401
Be my guest.

45:12.743 --> 45:13.835
DeaI!

45:14.478 --> 45:15.467
Come on.

45:30.694 --> 45:32.389
Bon voyage.

45:34.798 --> 45:36.925
I don't get it.
You Iet him get away
with the canister!

45:37.000 --> 45:39.594
We sure did. Boy, I'd give
anything to be there...

45:39.670 --> 45:41.729
when the Hammer-of-the-Desert
opens that canister.

45:41.805 --> 45:43.830
Yeah, but Carascas
wiII wish he wasn't.

45:43.907 --> 45:46.239
[chuckIing]
What are you two
taIking about?

45:46.310 --> 45:49.006
WeII, I just happened
to switch the canisters.

45:49.079 --> 45:50.671
He's got the phony one.

45:50.748 --> 45:52.807
As a matter of fact,
it's his death warrant.

45:52.883 --> 45:53.907
You mean it's empty?

45:53.984 --> 45:55.110
Not exactIy.

45:55.452 --> 45:57.181
What did you fiII it with,
anyway?

45:57.254 --> 45:58.585
WeII, nothing speciaI.

45:58.655 --> 46:02.614
I'm sure that the Hammer
has got cameI pens fuII of it.

46:14.838 --> 46:16.499
[beeping]

46:18.075 --> 46:19.235
Good news, MichaeI.

46:19.309 --> 46:20.867
Our sources
in the MiddIe East...

46:20.944 --> 46:24.641
report that
Carascas has arrived
to a tumuItuous fanfare.

46:24.915 --> 46:26.382
You mean
The-Hammer-of-the-Desert...

46:26.450 --> 46:29.442
was so overcome by what was
in the canister...

46:29.553 --> 46:32.283
that he went aII out
to express his gratitude?

46:32.356 --> 46:36.122
Right on. When Iast seen,
Carascas was being chased
into the desert...

46:36.193 --> 46:39.959
by some very angry dudes
with some very Iarge
steak knives.

46:41.165 --> 46:42.189
WeII, that's not aII.

46:42.266 --> 46:44.427
Mr. HoIIenbeck
is out of intensive care...

46:44.501 --> 46:46.867
and the Prosecutor's Office
agreed to take his efforts...

46:46.937 --> 46:49.201
to heIp us,
into consideration.

46:49.273 --> 46:50.831
WeII, congratuIations.

46:50.908 --> 46:53.741
You've aII come through
with fIying coIors
and I--

46:53.811 --> 46:55.301
(KITT)
Excuse me...

46:55.379 --> 46:58.780
but speaking of fIying coIors,
they have a way of becoming...

46:58.849 --> 47:01.613
the center of attention
these days, don't they?

47:01.685 --> 47:04.153
Do you think he's trying
to teII us something?

47:04.221 --> 47:06.416
MereIy making
an observation, MichaeI.

47:06.490 --> 47:08.958
You know, I reaIIy beIieve
that he's somewhat jeaIous.

47:09.026 --> 47:10.084
Somewhat?

47:10.160 --> 47:11.821
Boss, he's onIy
a coupIe of revs away...

47:11.895 --> 47:13.760
from a very bright shade
of green.

47:13.831 --> 47:16.231
[aII Iaughing]
I wouIdn't be caught junked
in green.

47:17.201 --> 47:18.259
Why not, KITT?

47:18.335 --> 47:20.701
I thought you Iooked
absoIuteIy stunning
in red.

47:20.771 --> 47:22.705
Yeah, I mean,
I was getting
the impression...

47:22.773 --> 47:25.537
that your cover was actuaIIy
beginning to grow on you.

47:25.609 --> 47:27.133
PIease, MichaeI...

47:27.211 --> 47:29.475
I'm the Knight Industries
Two Thousand...

47:29.546 --> 47:31.309
not a tomato on wheeIs.

47:31.381 --> 47:33.144
