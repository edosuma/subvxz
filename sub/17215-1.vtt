00:01.835 --> 00:04.838
**

00:12.446 --> 00:14.215
(bell clanging)

00:32.700 --> 00:34.868
(bell clanging)

00:48.449 --> 00:50.884
(car alarm blaring)

00:53.754 --> 00:56.457
(Mariella sobbing)

00:56.490 --> 00:58.859
Oh, my God!

00:58.892 --> 01:02.263
CHANCE:
At the time of my evaluation,

01:02.296 --> 01:05.533
Mariella Franko
was 19 months post

01:05.566 --> 01:08.369
a multiple-vehicle
road accident

01:08.402 --> 01:11.939
in which her 68-year-old father
was killed.

01:11.972 --> 01:14.375
Decapitated.

01:14.408 --> 01:16.944
Help me!

01:16.977 --> 01:19.046
See attached photographs.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.648
Help me!

01:20.681 --> 01:22.416
(screams)

01:22.450 --> 01:24.618
I found Miss Franko
to be suffering

01:24.652 --> 01:27.221
from chronic
post-traumatic stress disorder

01:27.255 --> 01:29.423
and major depression
and recommended

01:29.457 --> 01:32.726
a course of psychotherapy
and antidepressant medication.

01:32.760 --> 01:35.095
...required another
independent medical examination

01:35.129 --> 01:36.730
and that she refused?

01:36.764 --> 01:39.433
Yes, I am aware of that.
However...

01:39.467 --> 01:42.736
Unfortunately, she went on
to receive neither...

01:42.770 --> 01:44.638
Conditions of the plan
clearly state...

01:44.672 --> 01:47.641
...due to the fact that despite
a lengthy appeals process,

01:47.675 --> 01:49.843
her disability benefits
were terminated.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.088
(elevator dings)

02:01.121 --> 02:06.427
Patient is a 53-year-old
right-handed male.

02:06.460 --> 02:09.129
Status now four years post
an embolic stroke,

02:09.163 --> 02:12.733
after which he fell and struck
his head on a bathroom counter.

02:15.469 --> 02:20.040
Those close to him say
he's changed beyond recognition.

02:20.073 --> 02:22.876
(dog barking in distance)

02:22.910 --> 02:25.879
The patient has repeatedly
stated that he will someday

02:25.913 --> 02:28.949
play a major role in a battle

02:28.982 --> 02:32.686
between Satan, Yahweh,
and Jesus.

02:32.720 --> 02:35.289
Recently, believing it
would cleanse his body

02:35.323 --> 02:36.690
for the coming conflict,

02:36.724 --> 02:39.993
he ingested a mixture
of household cleaners,

02:40.027 --> 02:43.331
including bleach, ammonia,
and drain cleaner.

02:43.364 --> 02:44.365
(grunts)

02:48.101 --> 02:50.638
CHANCE: As his wife
no longer has the resources

02:50.671 --> 02:53.073
to care for him at home,
the only alternative

02:53.106 --> 02:57.411
would seem to be
long-term residential care.

02:59.747 --> 03:05.253
M.J. is a 42-year-old
right-handed female

03:05.286 --> 03:08.322
with several years
of college education.

03:08.356 --> 03:11.559
She has only partial
recollections of the assault.

03:11.592 --> 03:13.427
What are you doing?
What?

03:13.461 --> 03:15.195
Aah!

03:15.229 --> 03:20.434
She spent the last year watching
television or staying drunk.

03:20.468 --> 03:21.535
(man coughing)

03:21.569 --> 03:24.938
CHANCE: A group-home placement
was found for M.J.,

03:24.972 --> 03:27.941
and a course of medication
was recommended.

03:27.975 --> 03:30.444
She did not follow up
with either,

03:30.478 --> 03:33.447
and she is presently
living on the street.

03:36.917 --> 03:38.919
God damn it.

03:42.122 --> 03:44.057
(intercom buzzes)

03:53.567 --> 03:55.969
Jaclyn Blackstone
is a 39-year-old

03:56.003 --> 03:58.606
ambidextrous woman
living in Berkeley.

03:58.639 --> 04:01.775
She's referred
by the Stanford Neurology Clinic

04:01.809 --> 04:05.313
with complaints
of intermittent memory loss,

04:05.346 --> 04:08.148
poor concentration,
loss of time.

04:08.181 --> 04:11.619
Mrs. Blackstone.
I'm Eldon Chance.

04:27.167 --> 04:28.168
Thank you.

04:30.638 --> 04:31.772
You were saying?

04:34.274 --> 04:38.446
Oh, U.C. San Diego,
applied mathematics.

04:38.479 --> 04:39.947
Parents living?

04:39.980 --> 04:41.415
No.

04:41.449 --> 04:42.983
I'm sorry.

04:43.016 --> 04:44.685
And you are married.

04:44.718 --> 04:47.087
Yes. Raymond.
Three years.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.757
But we're separated
right now.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.525
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be rude.

04:51.559 --> 04:53.594
I went over all this
at Stanford already.

04:53.627 --> 04:56.296
Why did they
send me here?

04:56.330 --> 04:58.866
The doctors at Stanford
were unable to locate

04:58.899 --> 05:01.034
an organic basis
for your symptoms,

05:01.068 --> 05:03.471
so they asked me
to review their findings

05:03.504 --> 05:05.806
and if I agree,
which I do, by the way.

05:05.839 --> 05:07.708
So they think
I'm crazy, then.

05:07.741 --> 05:08.976
No.

05:09.009 --> 05:11.211
No, this is not saying
your symptoms aren't real,

05:11.244 --> 05:14.314
but you're here
so that you and I can decide

05:14.348 --> 05:16.049
how best to move forward.

05:16.083 --> 05:18.486
With you?

05:18.519 --> 05:20.153
No, I'm not
a treating therapist.

05:20.187 --> 05:21.822
I'm a consulting
neuropsychiatrist.

05:21.855 --> 05:23.957
Patients come to me,
and I assess them,

05:23.991 --> 05:26.860
then I refer them forward
to the appropriate next step --

05:26.894 --> 05:29.897
treatment plans,
specialists.

05:29.930 --> 05:33.200
Does that clear things up
a little?

05:33.233 --> 05:35.803
Yes.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.872
Okay, well,
there are a couple of things

05:38.906 --> 05:41.174
I'd like to know
more about.

05:41.208 --> 05:45.145
It says here that you separated
from your husband

05:45.178 --> 05:49.249
after he struck you in the face
with a jack handle.

05:49.282 --> 05:51.385
In the wake of which,
you were unconscious

05:51.419 --> 05:53.220
for a period
of at least 30 minutes,

05:53.253 --> 05:54.422
then shortly thereafter,

05:54.455 --> 05:58.726
you became aware of a second
personality -- Jackie Black.

06:01.194 --> 06:04.197
Is it possible
that this character

06:04.231 --> 06:07.701
was there before,
when you were younger?

06:07.735 --> 06:12.406
No. No, she wasn't.

06:12.440 --> 06:19.312
She does things
that I don't want to do.

06:21.782 --> 06:24.585
Such as?

06:24.618 --> 06:29.857
My husband, Raymond,
is a homicide detective.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.860
Oakland Police Department.

06:32.893 --> 06:36.797
And he's very...

06:40.601 --> 06:42.636
He's not...

06:46.507 --> 06:48.676
(sighs)
I had to get away.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.446
Okay.

06:52.480 --> 06:56.650
And ever since,
there's these -- these periods

06:56.684 --> 06:58.819
where I can't remember.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.654
And after...

07:00.688 --> 07:03.724
Raymond's always there.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.893
And...

07:05.926 --> 07:09.129
And I know
that I've been with him.

07:11.699 --> 07:14.434
(sighs) Even though
I don't want to be.

07:14.468 --> 07:16.804
Been with him sexually,
you mean.

07:16.837 --> 07:19.106
Yes.

07:19.139 --> 07:21.742
And I never know
when it's going to happen.

07:21.775 --> 07:25.312
And I don't know
how to make it stop.

07:25.345 --> 07:29.416
And you think
that's when Jackie takes over?

07:29.449 --> 07:30.618
(sighs)

07:32.620 --> 07:35.022
I hate the name Jackie.

07:35.055 --> 07:39.660
I hate the name Jackie.

07:42.830 --> 07:44.264
(sighs)

07:44.297 --> 07:47.635
The only person
who calls me that is him.

07:53.340 --> 07:55.175
Okay.

07:55.208 --> 07:58.779
Now, I noticed in one
of your records that you

07:58.812 --> 08:02.015
had been working
with a psychotherapist.

08:02.049 --> 08:03.851
Myra.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.152
Dr. Cohen.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.555
Do you mind me asking
why you stopped?

08:07.588 --> 08:08.889
She died.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.558
Oh.

08:10.591 --> 08:13.527
I'm sorry to hear that.

08:13.561 --> 08:16.964
This is Suzanne Simms
at Berkeley.

08:16.997 --> 08:20.901
I happen to think
she's particularly good

08:20.934 --> 08:23.136
and a good fit for you.

08:23.170 --> 08:26.473
I recommend
that she begin psychotherapy.

08:26.506 --> 08:31.111
I also recommend that she work
with a female therapist.

08:36.116 --> 08:37.217
Thank you.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.304
(indistinct conversations)

09:06.614 --> 09:07.648
Hey.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.286
Mom told me
about school.

09:20.093 --> 09:21.028
I'm sorry, Nick.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.063
I know how much
you like Havenwood.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.564
If there was
any other option --

09:24.598 --> 09:26.867
How about you
just stay with her?

09:26.900 --> 09:29.770
Well, things
are complicated.

09:29.803 --> 09:31.905
But there's other
good schools.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.140
Marina South blows.

09:33.173 --> 09:34.642
It does.

09:34.675 --> 09:38.111
It does indeed blow.

09:38.145 --> 09:41.381
But there's good schools
across the bay in Berkeley.

09:41.414 --> 09:42.750
We don't live in Berkeley.

09:42.783 --> 09:44.451
We don't live
in Berkeley now,

09:44.484 --> 09:46.219
but I've been
looking into it,

09:46.253 --> 09:48.055
and if I got
an apartment there --

09:48.088 --> 09:49.222
We just got one here.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.423
Listen...

09:50.457 --> 09:54.728
This is really difficult
for all of us.

09:54.762 --> 09:57.164
But what I want you to know
is that I'm doing

09:57.197 --> 09:59.633
everything I can for you,
and I always will.

10:01.669 --> 10:04.104
I love you very much.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.108
I know.

10:10.844 --> 10:13.914
This will work out,
all of this.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.783
You'll see.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.685
Life sucks.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.428
CHRISTINA: He keeps talking
about how the consignment shop

10:28.461 --> 10:29.997
pays less
for a bigger space,

10:30.030 --> 10:33.834
so he's at least
gonna raise the rent on me.

10:33.867 --> 10:36.837
Yeah, well, we needed
to talk about that, so...

10:36.870 --> 10:40.307
You are so sympathetic.

10:40.340 --> 10:41.809
Thanks.

10:41.842 --> 10:44.678
It's not as if you
have to give up photography

10:44.712 --> 10:47.147
just 'cause you
don't have the studio.

10:47.180 --> 10:50.217
But if I was better at it,
then I'd sell more work

10:50.250 --> 10:53.453
and be able to afford
the rent all by myself, right?

10:53.486 --> 10:55.522
I would still be paying
for both our lawyers.

10:55.555 --> 10:58.291
We still got to sell this house
with a double mortgage on it,

10:58.325 --> 11:00.393
and Nicole would still
have to change schools,

11:00.427 --> 11:03.230
which I guess
you told her.

11:03.263 --> 11:04.364
Yeah, I'm sorry.

11:04.397 --> 11:06.967
If she's not gonna go
to Marina South --
She's not.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.202
So, then we needed
to figure something out.

11:09.236 --> 11:11.371
And, you know,
I didn't want to have to be

11:11.404 --> 11:12.472
the one to tell her.

11:12.505 --> 11:16.744
But if I waited for you
to decide to tell her,

11:16.777 --> 11:19.379
I'd be waiting forever.

11:19.412 --> 11:22.582
You know, I don't --

11:22.615 --> 11:25.385
I don't have to wait for you
to make up your mind --

11:25.418 --> 11:27.387
about that
or about anything else,

11:27.420 --> 11:29.757
for that matter,
any more.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.558
Thank God.

11:31.591 --> 11:34.261
I guess I'd better
get going.

11:34.294 --> 11:37.230
Thank you
for bringing her home.

11:37.264 --> 11:39.532
Look after yourself,
Eldon.

11:41.301 --> 11:42.936
Right.
But it's not just the lighting.

11:42.970 --> 11:45.272
It's also the paint.

11:45.305 --> 11:50.010
That is -- That is just not
financially feasible.

11:50.043 --> 11:53.613
We can't get anything new
right now.

11:53.646 --> 11:57.851
Well, I'm sorry,
but this can't be the first time

11:57.885 --> 12:01.321
you had clients
who had to sell as is.

12:04.724 --> 12:07.527
Okay, well, if the photos
need to be redone,

12:07.560 --> 12:10.798
you need to talk to Christina
because she took them.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.185
Life does suck, sweetheart.

12:40.961 --> 12:42.595
CARL: No, no, no, no, no!
Look at me!

12:42.629 --> 12:44.131
Are you gonna be
his bitch now?

12:44.164 --> 12:46.099
Is that the way
it's supposed to be? Hm?

12:49.269 --> 12:50.904
Young man...

12:50.938 --> 12:55.775
What news of
the Delange collection?

12:58.045 --> 13:00.113
Bookshelf,
desk, two chairs.

13:00.147 --> 13:02.282
But there's
something missing.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.117
Wow.
That's some memory.

13:04.151 --> 13:06.586
Yes, and bits
of the metalwork.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.189
Ah. You're a doctor,
as I recall.

13:09.222 --> 13:11.424
Psychiatrist.
Eldon Chance.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.693
Dr. Chance, how does one
forget a name like that.

13:13.726 --> 13:14.862
Carl Allen.

13:14.895 --> 13:15.929
How do you do?

13:15.963 --> 13:18.131
I've recently acquired
a cabinet.

13:18.165 --> 13:20.600
Might go well
with that set of yours.

13:20.633 --> 13:21.601
I wish.

13:21.634 --> 13:25.005
Thinking of selling
what I have.

13:25.038 --> 13:28.275
Divorce.
House is up for sale.

13:28.308 --> 13:31.178
Say no more.
I'm so sorry.

13:31.211 --> 13:33.146
I have pictures.

13:33.180 --> 13:37.317
Without the metalwork,
$50,000, $60,000 -- maybe.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.619
What about
with the metalwork?

13:39.652 --> 13:44.124
Just to make me
feel bad.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.193
Twice that.

13:46.226 --> 13:49.129
Jesus! Really?
Just for a piece of brass?

13:49.162 --> 13:50.163
Mm.

13:53.666 --> 13:57.537
This brass work's
not exactly like yours,

13:57.570 --> 14:00.240
but it's not
so dissimilar.

14:00.273 --> 14:04.644
It's the same time period
and just as delicate.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.846
Wow.

14:06.880 --> 14:09.216
Well, given what you
just told me,

14:09.249 --> 14:11.584
this is way
out of my price range.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.153
Even if I was buying --

14:13.186 --> 14:15.889
That's not
original brass work.

14:15.923 --> 14:16.756
Really?

14:16.789 --> 14:19.026
It didn't have any brass
when I found it.

14:19.059 --> 14:21.294
I just saw that there
were possibilities.

14:25.098 --> 14:28.201
D, come out here
a minute.

14:28.235 --> 14:30.003
(door slides open)

14:30.037 --> 14:33.740
This is D.

14:33.773 --> 14:36.676
D, meet Dr. Chance.

14:36.709 --> 14:37.744
Hey.

14:37.777 --> 14:40.047
Take a look at this.

14:42.782 --> 14:45.585
What do you think?

14:48.288 --> 14:49.889
Sure.

14:52.993 --> 14:54.294
(door slides closed)

14:54.327 --> 14:55.828
A man of few words.

14:58.465 --> 15:00.367
He did this?

15:00.400 --> 15:02.769
Yours, too.

15:02.802 --> 15:05.472
If that's what you want.

15:10.110 --> 15:13.480
You would put it
up for sale

15:13.513 --> 15:15.615
with the new brass...

15:18.251 --> 15:20.453
There wouldn't be
ways of checking?

15:20.487 --> 15:24.291
Your furniture is signed,
as I recall.

15:24.324 --> 15:25.792
That's usually enough.

15:25.825 --> 15:29.429
Did you buy it from a dealer,
or was it a private party?

15:29.462 --> 15:30.430
Estate sale.

15:30.463 --> 15:32.765
Private parties are good.

15:32.799 --> 15:35.902
Perhaps I'd better
sleep on it.

15:35.935 --> 15:39.372
As many nights
as you like.

16:22.049 --> 16:25.218
Mrs. Blackstone?

16:25.252 --> 16:27.687
Eldon Chance.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.322
We met
a couple of months ago.

16:29.356 --> 16:30.357
Oh.

16:33.926 --> 16:35.395
Don't you just love
this place?

16:35.428 --> 16:37.130
I do, yeah, yeah.

16:37.164 --> 16:38.865
What did you find?

16:38.898 --> 16:41.334
Oh, I'm just hunting ideas.

16:41.368 --> 16:45.872
I like to redo old pieces,
give them another life.

16:45.905 --> 16:47.640
You?

16:47.674 --> 16:49.642
Ah.

16:49.676 --> 16:52.079
Yours is fancier
than mine.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.581
But then,
you are the doctor.

16:54.614 --> 16:55.482
Well, yeah.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.550
No, I just have
some furniture like this

16:57.584 --> 16:59.752
that I'm thinking
of selling.

16:59.786 --> 17:01.988
Hard to decide?

17:02.021 --> 17:04.324
You have no idea.

17:04.357 --> 17:08.195
Well, don't think
too long.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.997
Now, why would
you say that?

17:11.030 --> 17:12.332
I don't know.

17:12.365 --> 17:16.269
It just seemed like
good all-purpose advice.

17:16.303 --> 17:19.806
You could say it
about so many things.

17:28.481 --> 17:30.617
I-I wanted
to let you know.

17:30.650 --> 17:33.086
I've been seeing
that therapist,

17:33.120 --> 17:36.089
the one that you recommended --
Suzanne.

17:36.123 --> 17:40.093
This may be stupid
after only six weeks,

17:40.127 --> 17:43.763
but it's really
changed everything.

17:43.796 --> 17:46.566
Great.
So, you're feeling better?

17:46.599 --> 17:49.436
Better than I have
in a long time.

17:49.469 --> 17:51.438
I've been working again.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.440
What kind of work is it
you're doing?

17:53.473 --> 17:54.574
Uh, tutoring, mainly.

17:54.607 --> 17:57.444
Oh, that's right -- math.

17:57.477 --> 18:00.880
Yeah.
Since the separation.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.216
Well, I'm glad
I bumped into you just now.

18:03.250 --> 18:06.286
So am I.
I wish you all the best.

18:08.488 --> 18:12.925
Uh, enjoy your book
about your furniture.

18:12.959 --> 18:16.529
And good luck,
whatever you decide.

18:45.658 --> 18:48.495
And when did they
even do this audit, Dan?

18:48.528 --> 18:50.297
And what does it have to do
with me?

18:50.330 --> 18:52.499
DAN: On your end,
it's unsubstantiated expenses.

18:52.532 --> 18:54.167
On hers,
it's unreported income.

18:54.201 --> 18:56.536
I don't have anything to do
with Christina's business

18:56.569 --> 18:58.705
or how she accounts
for anything -- or doesn't.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.773
Okay, but you file jointly,
Eldon.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.108
And now with back taxes

19:02.141 --> 19:04.611
for the unreported years,
plus penalties...

19:04.644 --> 19:07.947
A quarter of a million dollars?
Fuck, Dan!

19:07.980 --> 19:09.716
I mean, fuck!

19:22.695 --> 19:24.831
Doc Chance.

19:24.864 --> 19:26.466
Hey, D.

19:26.499 --> 19:30.237
Sorry to interrupt.
Is Carl around?

19:30.270 --> 19:31.371
At home.

19:31.404 --> 19:34.541
A little
under the weather.

19:34.574 --> 19:36.075
Okay, well...

19:36.108 --> 19:39.212
I guess
maybe you're the guy

19:39.246 --> 19:42.382
I need to talk to anyway,
to begin.

19:42.415 --> 19:46.386
Uh, do you remember
that furniture we looked at

19:46.419 --> 19:50.823
about a month or so ago,
that French Art Deco stuff?

19:50.857 --> 19:52.058
I do.

19:52.091 --> 19:54.060
You decide
you want to make it right?

19:54.093 --> 19:55.362
(chuckles)

19:55.395 --> 19:58.030
I guess that's one way
of putting it.

19:58.064 --> 20:01.834
I-I feel like I'd need to know
what it would cost, you know,

20:01.868 --> 20:03.536
if I had to pay
for the work up front

20:03.570 --> 20:05.338
or if there'd be some way
of settling it

20:05.372 --> 20:06.373
once the stuff is sold.

20:06.406 --> 20:08.875
Payment, you'd have
to talk to Carl.

20:08.908 --> 20:11.010
Yeah.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.512
Of course.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.347
But let's say I'm ready.

20:14.381 --> 20:16.215
I get the stuff down here,

20:16.249 --> 20:18.851
I talk payment
when Carl is back.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.254
You know,
I-I'd need help.

20:21.288 --> 20:22.455
Right now work?

20:22.489 --> 20:23.456
Now?

20:23.490 --> 20:25.292
Uh, yeah, sure.

20:25.325 --> 20:26.593
Uh, I need a truck.

20:26.626 --> 20:29.028
Penske's three blocks down,
one over.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.930
Market and 4th.

20:30.963 --> 20:35.402
Okay.
Well, uh, you're on.

20:37.570 --> 20:41.240
Mind me --
Mind me asking what that is?

20:41.274 --> 20:43.410
You can ask.

20:43.443 --> 20:46.212
Is it --
Is that a hatchet?

20:46.245 --> 20:47.280
Tomahawk.

20:47.314 --> 20:49.382
What's the difference?

20:49.416 --> 20:53.052
Hatchet's a tool.
Tomahawk's a weapon.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.421
Is it for you?

20:54.454 --> 20:58.391
Buddy of mine keeps going
back to Afghanistan.

20:58.425 --> 21:00.327
This is what he likes.

21:00.360 --> 21:03.296
Is that where you were?

21:12.539 --> 21:14.674
Use the forge
to temper the blade.

21:14.707 --> 21:17.510
You want it thin enough
to cut --

21:17.544 --> 21:19.412
hard, but not brittle.

21:19.446 --> 21:21.180
My buddy reports back.

21:21.213 --> 21:24.784
We discuss ways of making it
more effective.

21:24.817 --> 21:27.854
The man does like
his scalps.

21:32.792 --> 21:36.629
Okay. Well, I'll go see
about that truck.

21:48.341 --> 21:50.076
(panting)

21:59.552 --> 22:02.221
You want
a glass of water?

22:05.658 --> 22:07.494
You take this.

22:15.768 --> 22:17.003
(grunts)

22:17.036 --> 22:17.904
Let's go.

22:17.937 --> 22:20.940
You wrap it and strap.
I'll get the rest.

22:22.942 --> 22:25.311
(horns honking)

22:25.344 --> 22:28.147
MAN: Come on!

22:28.180 --> 22:30.249
-Move it already!
-Okay, sorry. Just --

22:30.282 --> 22:32.051
-Come on, let's go!
-One minute.

22:32.084 --> 22:34.521
Sorry, sorry.
Just...

22:36.222 --> 22:37.390
Get around him!

22:37.424 --> 22:39.191
Let's go!
Come on, move it!

22:39.225 --> 22:40.192
Hurry up!

22:40.226 --> 22:41.561
Sorry. Just --

22:41.594 --> 22:42.595
God!

22:42.629 --> 22:46.065
(honking continues)

22:46.098 --> 22:48.901
Get the fuck
out of the way!

22:48.935 --> 22:50.537
(honks)

22:50.570 --> 22:51.771
(tires screech)

22:51.804 --> 22:54.340
What the fuck's
wrong with you?

22:54.373 --> 22:56.776
Fuck this.

22:58.144 --> 22:59.245
Back up!

23:00.747 --> 23:02.248
(tires screech)

23:05.485 --> 23:08.120
Shit.

23:25.972 --> 23:28.374
That was pretty good
back there.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.977
Shit like that
makes my day.

23:36.783 --> 23:38.417
(bell clanging)

23:43.122 --> 23:44.791
Friend of yours
is in there.

23:44.824 --> 23:46.425
In here?

23:46.459 --> 23:47.727
Yeah.

23:47.760 --> 23:50.463
Suzanne.

23:50.497 --> 23:52.098
How nice.

23:52.131 --> 23:53.466
Won't be in a minute.

23:53.500 --> 23:56.435
Do you remember
that last patient you sent me --

23:56.469 --> 23:58.671
Jaclyn Blackstone?

23:58.705 --> 24:02.775
Uh, losing time,
memory problems,

24:02.809 --> 24:04.911
claims to have
a second personality.

24:04.944 --> 24:06.145
She's been beaten up.

24:06.178 --> 24:08.848
She's at Seton Medical.

24:08.881 --> 24:10.016
The ex?

24:10.049 --> 24:11.751
I can't believe it isn't.

24:11.784 --> 24:15.454
Would you go
look in on her?

24:15.488 --> 24:17.156
She's not my patient.

24:17.189 --> 24:19.258
No, but you saw her as one.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.127
You know the staff there.
They'll talk to you.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.830
Just -- Just go
check on her.

24:23.863 --> 24:25.898
Please, El.

24:29.569 --> 24:31.671
What's Jaclyn
saying happened?

24:31.704 --> 24:32.939
Well, she's saying

24:32.972 --> 24:36.275
she surprised an intruder
on the patio of her condo.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.777
I suppose
that's possible.

24:37.810 --> 24:38.878
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

24:38.911 --> 24:41.013
And let's not rule out
alien abduction.

24:41.047 --> 24:44.884
I mean, she was doing so well,
and that bastard kept coming.

24:44.917 --> 24:46.452
And she was saying no.

24:46.485 --> 24:50.389
And after, what,
seven sessions?

24:50.422 --> 24:52.525
It had to be him.

24:57.897 --> 24:59.899
You got to let me
take care of you.

25:12.411 --> 25:15.414
NURSE: (sighs) Orbital blowout
fracture on the right side.

25:15.447 --> 25:17.917
No structural damage
or bleeding in the brain.

25:17.950 --> 25:19.552
But there
is an entrapped muscle,

25:19.586 --> 25:22.254
so they're going to have to go
in and relieve the pressure.

25:22.288 --> 25:23.723
When do they
plan to operate?

25:23.756 --> 25:26.025
This afternoon
with Jellicoe.

25:26.058 --> 25:28.194
Oh, she's lucky.
He's good.

25:28.227 --> 25:29.261
Excuse me.

25:29.295 --> 25:30.329
Thank you.

25:30.362 --> 25:34.100
You one of her doctors?

25:37.970 --> 25:40.673
Miss Blackstone?

25:40.707 --> 25:42.508
I'm a neuropsychiatrist.

25:42.541 --> 25:47.046
I was asked to look in on her
by her therapist, Suzanne Simms.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.549
You were in her room
just now.

25:50.583 --> 25:53.285
Why didn't you
look in on her?

25:53.319 --> 25:56.689
I saw that she had
a visitor.

25:56.723 --> 25:58.524
There's no rush.

25:58.557 --> 26:01.160
Really? Not like
any of the doctors I know.

26:06.733 --> 26:08.134
Yeah.

26:11.337 --> 26:13.572
Oh, no, you look too good
to be in a hospital.

26:13.606 --> 26:15.141
You need to go home.

26:15.174 --> 26:17.009
Okay?

26:36.763 --> 26:38.497
Jaclyn, I'm so sorry.

26:43.335 --> 26:45.137
You'll feel better
after the surgery.

26:45.171 --> 26:46.906
After they've freed up
that muscle,

26:46.939 --> 26:48.675
you'll stop seeing
two of everything.

26:48.708 --> 26:50.009
You should go.

26:50.042 --> 26:52.478
I'm told
the surgeon's good.

26:52.511 --> 26:54.914
I'll see him
on my way out.

26:54.947 --> 26:56.348
Please.

27:09.628 --> 27:13.032
(door opens, closes)

27:20.139 --> 27:22.541
(siren wailing in distance)

27:28.915 --> 27:31.751
(indistinct shouting)

27:48.200 --> 27:52.238
What's up, big dog?
You got more furniture to move?

27:52.271 --> 27:53.505
Not yet.

27:53.539 --> 27:55.074
How's the brass coming?

27:55.107 --> 27:57.643
(sighs)
Still waiting on what I need.

27:57.676 --> 28:00.046
Be a couple of weeks
once I start.

28:00.079 --> 28:04.717
CARL: Is there a healer
amongst us?

28:04.751 --> 28:08.020
Ah. I thought
I heard your voice.

28:08.054 --> 28:10.890
Jesus.
What happened to you?

28:10.923 --> 28:12.859
Ah, minor mishap.

28:12.892 --> 28:16.996
I'm happy you brought
your pieces in.

28:17.029 --> 28:19.999
I already have some people
who may be interested.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.200
Buyers?

28:21.233 --> 28:23.069
Beautiful buyers.

28:23.102 --> 28:26.873
Find me when you boys
are done, hm?

28:26.906 --> 28:29.241
We'll have to document
the furniture

28:29.275 --> 28:31.710
and get your signature
on some papers.

28:31.744 --> 28:34.246
(slurping)

28:34.280 --> 28:37.716
Uh, yeah, sure.
Okay.

28:37.750 --> 28:39.551
Toodle-oo.

28:44.423 --> 28:45.792
What happened to him?

28:45.825 --> 28:48.895
Kid took him off
a few weeks ago.

28:48.928 --> 28:50.930
Hey, hey.

28:50.963 --> 28:53.399
That's setting.

28:53.432 --> 28:55.601
What -- What kid?

28:55.634 --> 28:56.535
(sighs)

28:56.568 --> 28:59.872
Flavor-of-
the-fucking-month kid.

28:59.906 --> 29:02.141
Rubber shirt,
pointed boots?

29:02.174 --> 29:04.543
He wanted money.
Carl said no.

29:04.576 --> 29:06.979
Came back
with two of his pals.

29:07.013 --> 29:09.916
They beat Carl up
and stole some shit.

29:09.949 --> 29:11.650
A couple antique chairs,

29:11.683 --> 29:15.387
some money that was
in the highboy by the register.

29:15.421 --> 29:16.823
(slurps)

29:21.693 --> 29:23.562
What pisses me off,

29:23.595 --> 29:27.033
I wasn't here
when they came around.

29:29.869 --> 29:30.970
(cup clatters)

29:32.771 --> 29:35.141
But I guess
that's how they planned it.

29:37.643 --> 29:40.479
You got to watch it
with that shit.

29:40.512 --> 29:43.415
What do you mean?
What -- What shit?

29:43.449 --> 29:47.186
Having a routine, same place,
same time every day.

29:47.219 --> 29:50.322
Like walking around with
a fucking target on your back.

29:50.356 --> 29:52.158
But I got it
all back, so...

29:54.160 --> 29:55.627
The stuff that was stolen?

29:55.661 --> 29:56.795
That and then some.

29:56.829 --> 29:58.865
What, and they --
they just gave it to you?

29:58.898 --> 30:00.666
They didn't want
to fight you for it?

30:00.699 --> 30:03.335
One of the kid's pals did try
his luck with a baseball bat.

30:03.369 --> 30:05.704
Not a good idea,
is what you're saying.

30:05.737 --> 30:07.706
Should have stuck
to baseballs.

30:07.739 --> 30:09.876
Then what?

30:09.909 --> 30:12.144
Then he went away.

30:17.083 --> 30:18.717
Yeah, well...

30:18.750 --> 30:20.486
Well, I could think
of a few more assholes

30:20.519 --> 30:21.988
you could give
that treatment to.

30:22.021 --> 30:24.857
Yeah? Like who?

30:27.559 --> 30:30.329
Just -- Just half the city.
(chuckles)

30:54.453 --> 30:58.824
CHANCE:
L.S. is a 46-year-old male
raised by an abusive mother.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.526
He states that as a child

31:00.559 --> 31:03.229
he seemed to learn
everything backward.

31:03.262 --> 31:06.232
He read not only
individual words backward,

31:06.265 --> 31:08.434
but entire pages.

31:08.467 --> 31:11.070
When he was forced to read
a book from the beginning,

31:11.103 --> 31:12.671
he has little sense of the story

31:12.704 --> 31:15.674
until he is able to read it
again from the end.

31:15.707 --> 31:18.244
His great passions are reading
about mental illness

31:18.277 --> 31:20.512
and learning disabilities

31:20.546 --> 31:23.849
and caring
for his 73 exotic birds.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.384
(birds squawking)

31:25.417 --> 31:27.119
(speaking native language)

31:27.153 --> 31:28.620
(chuckles)

31:28.654 --> 31:30.089
Hey. Hey.

31:37.429 --> 31:40.032
CHANCE:
At the time of my evaluation,

31:40.066 --> 31:42.234
Miss Franko
was 19 months post

31:42.268 --> 31:44.570
a head-on
motor vehicle accident

31:44.603 --> 31:47.873
in which her 68-year-old father
was decapitated.

31:47.906 --> 31:51.543
MAN: "Dear Eldon,
it is with great sadness

31:51.577 --> 31:53.745
that I write to you today.

31:53.779 --> 31:57.283
Last week, Mariella Franko
lost her battle with depression

31:57.316 --> 31:58.750
and took her own life.

31:58.784 --> 32:01.087
It seemed to Mariella
that she died

32:01.120 --> 32:03.655
with her father that night
on the road.

32:09.295 --> 32:10.696
(elevator dings)

32:18.937 --> 32:20.239
LUCY:
I told Mrs. Blackstone

32:20.272 --> 32:21.940
she will have to make
an appointment --

32:21.974 --> 32:23.142
CHANCE:
It's okay, Lucy.

32:23.175 --> 32:25.577
The Jenkinses
have been waiting.

32:25.611 --> 32:27.746
Just one second.

32:27.779 --> 32:28.981
I should go.

32:29.015 --> 32:30.149
No, it's okay.

32:30.182 --> 32:34.020
It's just I don't have
a lot of time right now is all.

32:34.053 --> 32:36.622
But if you'd like
to wait, um...

32:38.524 --> 32:40.659
Or there's a café
on the corner.

32:40.692 --> 32:43.462
You know, I could join you
in about an hour

32:43.495 --> 32:45.631
and we'd have
some time to talk.

32:45.664 --> 32:47.199
Thank you.

32:47.233 --> 32:49.335
I don't know...

32:49.368 --> 32:52.938
Half a block --
Columbus.

32:52.971 --> 32:55.107
(sighs)
I'm sorry, really.

32:55.141 --> 32:56.108
It's okay.

32:56.142 --> 32:57.543
Thank you.

33:07.719 --> 33:10.556
You don't know
what she's been through.

33:10.589 --> 33:11.957
No, but she strikes me

33:11.990 --> 33:14.493
as someone who knows
how to get her way.

33:14.526 --> 33:15.461
You should have seen

33:15.494 --> 33:17.229
her little-girl-lost routine
earlier.

33:17.263 --> 33:19.831
I mean,
she's been here before.

33:19.865 --> 33:22.701
And sustained a pretty good
concussion since.

33:22.734 --> 33:24.936
You got so tough
all of a sudden.

33:35.747 --> 33:37.383
WOMAN:
What can I get for you?

33:37.416 --> 33:40.386
Uh, I'll take
a black coffee.

33:47.393 --> 33:49.261
Hey.

33:49.295 --> 33:53.765
I didn't know
if you'd still be here.

33:53.799 --> 33:57.269
How is your patient?

33:57.303 --> 34:00.106
(sighs) Well...

34:02.441 --> 34:04.009
I...I shouldn't
ask that.

34:04.042 --> 34:06.178
No, no, no, no, it's okay.
It's okay.

34:06.212 --> 34:09.115
I, uh...

34:09.148 --> 34:10.582
The guy is 39 years old.

34:10.616 --> 34:12.584
He's married.
He's got one kid.

34:12.618 --> 34:15.287
He's about two years
post a second craniotomy

34:15.321 --> 34:17.889
for a malignant
brain tumor.

34:17.923 --> 34:21.560
He's got
about six months.

34:21.593 --> 34:25.397
His wife
was with him today.

34:29.968 --> 34:32.171
My God.

34:36.142 --> 34:38.577
What do you say to them?

34:42.281 --> 34:44.049
The truth.

34:44.082 --> 34:46.084
We talk about...

34:48.019 --> 34:51.757
counseling,
support groups.

34:51.790 --> 34:55.894
I can't help them anymore,
but I can walk with them.

34:55.927 --> 34:58.430
I hold their hands.

35:02.868 --> 35:04.102
Thank you.

35:11.877 --> 35:15.314
You're a good doctor.

35:15.347 --> 35:17.683
People want miracles.

35:17.716 --> 35:22.854
Maybe the only miracle
is I can take your hand.

35:24.890 --> 35:27.125
That's the miracle --

35:27.159 --> 35:32.964
the striking through,
the freeing of the caged heart.

35:32.998 --> 35:35.301
'Cause without it...

35:35.334 --> 35:37.536
life is just half lived.

35:43.242 --> 35:45.677
He'll kill me.

35:47.145 --> 35:49.881
He said he would,
and I believe him.

35:54.853 --> 35:56.288
This is your husband.

35:56.322 --> 35:57.356
It's not some intruder.

35:57.389 --> 35:59.057
This is your husband
who beat you.

35:59.090 --> 36:00.659
He could make
Jaclyn disappear.

36:00.692 --> 36:02.628
Wait a second, you...

36:02.661 --> 36:07.032
you just referred to yourself
in the third person.

36:07.065 --> 36:09.067
Is this Jackie
I'm talking to?

36:09.100 --> 36:11.537
No. I don't know.
I don't care about Jackie.

36:20.679 --> 36:22.848
Can you continue
with Suzanne?

36:22.881 --> 36:24.683
He won't let me.

36:24.716 --> 36:25.817
(scoffs)

36:25.851 --> 36:29.321
This was big,
even coming here.

36:29.355 --> 36:31.923
This is dangerous for me.

36:31.957 --> 36:33.525
It could be for you, too.

36:33.559 --> 36:35.994
I could be putting us
both in danger.

36:36.027 --> 36:38.930
Yeah, well, there's --
there's a difference

36:38.964 --> 36:42.701
between what people threaten
and what they'll actually do.

36:42.734 --> 36:44.270
You don't know Raymond.

36:44.303 --> 36:48.640
Okay, I-I know
this is difficult.

36:50.709 --> 36:53.178
But if you met someone
who knows the law,

36:53.211 --> 36:54.613
who's versed in the law.

36:54.646 --> 36:57.883
It's part of my job
to testify in court.
It's okay.

36:57.916 --> 36:59.851
I know people.
I've met people.

36:59.885 --> 37:01.520
There's nothing you can do.
I can make inquiries.

37:01.553 --> 37:04.222
There's nothing
anyone can do.

37:04.256 --> 37:07.959
Maybe it's like you said.

37:07.993 --> 37:11.630
Maybe there's just this.

37:16.101 --> 37:18.737
(sighs)
Maybe this is why I came.

37:37.656 --> 37:39.625
(ringing)

37:39.658 --> 37:41.327
LUCY: Hello?

37:41.360 --> 37:42.828
Hey, Lucy.

37:42.861 --> 37:44.630
Something I want you
to do for me.

37:44.663 --> 37:47.098
Myra Cohen -- C-O-H-E-N.

37:47.132 --> 37:49.968
Psychotherapist in the Bay Area,
now deceased.

37:50.001 --> 37:51.303
See what you can find
on her.

37:51.337 --> 37:52.604
Okay,
like what kind of thing?

37:52.638 --> 37:53.905
Anything you can.

37:53.939 --> 37:57.142
Like where were her offices,
was she a partner,

37:57.175 --> 37:59.578
can we get access
to her records?

37:59.611 --> 38:01.780
Myra Cohen.
Who was she?

38:01.813 --> 38:04.316
Jaclyn Blackstone's
therapist.

38:04.350 --> 38:06.852
I want to know
what she knew.

38:24.703 --> 38:26.271
I don't have
too much time,

38:26.304 --> 38:28.540
but you sounded
so mysterious on the phone.

38:31.377 --> 38:34.312
She's not gonna make it,
Suzanne.

38:34.346 --> 38:37.015
Not with that guy
in her life.

38:37.048 --> 38:39.951
Yet here she stays,
in this city.

38:39.985 --> 38:43.455
She says that if she left,
he'd find her.

38:43.489 --> 38:45.957
You already know
what he's capable of.

38:45.991 --> 38:48.727
And by the way,
why should she have to run?

38:48.760 --> 38:51.262
She's made
her life here.

38:53.399 --> 38:56.334
We are on the same side,
right?

38:56.368 --> 38:59.137
Do I think Jaclyn's hooked up
with a monster? Yes.

38:59.170 --> 39:02.340
Do I think she deserves a chance
to work through her shit?

39:02.374 --> 39:04.376
Absolutely.

39:04.410 --> 39:06.912
But you're making me think
there's more to it.

39:06.945 --> 39:08.179
Let me rephrase that.

39:08.213 --> 39:12.918
You're making me afraid
there's something more to it.

39:12.951 --> 39:16.187
So assuage my fears,
why don't you.

39:16.221 --> 39:17.856
There isn't more to it.

39:17.889 --> 39:19.057
Oh, so...

39:19.090 --> 39:20.726
[Chuckles]
I shouldn't be concerned

39:20.759 --> 39:21.760
by the degree to which

39:21.793 --> 39:23.662
you're involving yourself
in her affairs.

39:23.695 --> 39:25.531
Yeah, "involving"
is such a dirty word,

39:25.564 --> 39:26.765
implying, as it does,

39:26.798 --> 39:29.601
the getting off of one's ass.
Oh, no, I didn't mean that --

39:29.635 --> 39:31.903
We do something
or we don't, Suzanne.

39:31.937 --> 39:36.074
It's that simple.
We act or we give in to despair.

39:38.644 --> 39:41.513
Walk me to my train.
Come on.

39:41.547 --> 39:44.883
Did Jaclyn ever tell you
how she met him?

39:44.916 --> 39:48.787
She was being stalked
by some guy she went out with.

39:48.820 --> 39:52.190
She called the police.
Guess who showed up.

39:52.223 --> 39:55.360
Well, she wouldn't be
the first to trade

39:55.393 --> 39:57.796
one abusive man
for another.

39:57.829 --> 40:00.098
I met the husband.

40:00.131 --> 40:02.468
What was that like?

40:02.501 --> 40:04.770
Creepy is what
it was like.

40:04.803 --> 40:07.739
It would be hard
leaving her to him.

40:07.773 --> 40:08.940
I can imagine.

40:08.974 --> 40:12.644
I can also imagine that's
what she's counting on.

40:12.678 --> 40:13.645
(indistinct shouting)

40:13.679 --> 40:15.213
MAN: Give it back!

40:15.246 --> 40:17.215
-Shut up!
-Take everything!

40:17.248 --> 40:19.985
Take everything! Here!
Everything's gone!

40:20.018 --> 40:21.286
Everything's gone!

40:21.319 --> 40:23.254
My God,
sometimes I wonder

40:23.288 --> 40:25.991
how rational discourse
is even possible.

40:26.024 --> 40:27.826
And now you took this shit
from me!

40:27.859 --> 40:29.327
-Give it back!
-Eldon?

40:29.360 --> 40:31.463
You know
I'm on Jaclyn's side.

40:31.497 --> 40:32.498
You know that.

40:32.531 --> 40:35.000
I-I thought
we were making progress.

40:35.033 --> 40:38.169
And I think that she is
a-a bright, likable woman

40:38.203 --> 40:40.405
who may someday
be whole or not.

40:40.438 --> 40:42.908
The bottom line
is I never should have

40:42.941 --> 40:44.910
asked you
to look in on her.

40:44.943 --> 40:47.846
I never should have asked you
to get involved.

40:47.879 --> 40:49.180
Especially not you.

40:49.214 --> 40:51.316
It was once --
a long time ago.

40:51.349 --> 40:52.984
I know.
I know it was.

40:53.018 --> 40:54.252
(cellphone chimes)

40:54.285 --> 40:58.824
Once is a mistake.
Twice is a decision.

40:58.857 --> 41:01.927
(chiming continues)

41:01.960 --> 41:03.194
Yeah.

41:03.228 --> 41:05.964
LUCY: All right, the therapist
you asked me about, Myra Cohen.

41:05.997 --> 41:06.965
You ready?

41:06.998 --> 41:08.433
Sounds dramatic, but yes.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.936
She had a practice
with two other doctors

41:10.969 --> 41:13.338
in North Berkeley
until she was murdered

41:13.371 --> 41:15.306
by some intruder
they never found.

41:15.340 --> 41:17.375
The offices were burned
to the ground,

41:17.408 --> 41:19.945
and any records she had
were lost in the fire.

41:19.978 --> 41:22.814
Does the plot thicken?

41:48.339 --> 41:50.075
(banging)

41:57.683 --> 41:59.250
What's up, buddy?

41:59.284 --> 42:01.887
I was
in the neighborhood.

42:14.900 --> 42:18.436
The French have a phrase...

42:18.469 --> 42:20.606
Mutiles de guerre.

42:20.639 --> 42:22.540
Do you know it?

42:22.574 --> 42:25.376
"I was mutilated by war."

42:25.410 --> 42:31.883
I spend my days in the company
of those mutilated by life...

42:31.917 --> 42:35.520
most of them
beyond repair.

42:35.553 --> 42:40.091
But I have always held
to the belief

42:40.125 --> 42:42.894
that there are times...

42:44.896 --> 42:48.734
Not times -- moments --
when the right...

42:48.767 --> 42:51.903
word or emotion...

42:54.239 --> 42:58.009
a single touch,
might heal.

43:01.346 --> 43:03.448
And I have held this

43:03.481 --> 43:07.986
though I know
that the workings of the world

43:08.019 --> 43:12.991
will not permit these --
these words or emotions.

43:13.024 --> 43:17.896
There will be no grand gestures
or interventions.

43:17.929 --> 43:20.966
They are all...

43:20.999 --> 43:26.437
images seen
through a glass darkly...

43:26.471 --> 43:29.474
in the midst
of my own decline.

43:33.011 --> 43:36.281
Did I mention
that I have been drinking?

43:36.314 --> 43:39.017
You should take
a load off, Doc.

43:40.786 --> 43:42.620
Mm.

43:48.493 --> 43:50.829
I was trying
to help someone.

43:50.862 --> 43:54.966
And it seems that the last
person who tried to help them

43:55.000 --> 43:58.369
was killed, was murdered
in a hideous fashion.

43:58.403 --> 44:01.773
Now, does that
make the helping

44:01.807 --> 44:06.144
an even worse idea
or a moral imperative?

44:06.177 --> 44:08.479
Murdered by who?
Do we know?

44:08.513 --> 44:11.149
In all likelihood,
the husband --

44:11.182 --> 44:13.651
an Oakland
homicide detective.

44:13.685 --> 44:15.987
Or at least,
he's behind it.

44:16.021 --> 44:19.157
He never gets his hands dirty,
she says.

44:19.190 --> 44:20.959
He gets it done.

44:20.992 --> 44:22.861
He's smart, then.

44:22.894 --> 44:26.164
A guy like that
could be a problem.

44:26.197 --> 44:30.535
A homicidal homicide detective.
Yeah, I would say.

44:30.568 --> 44:33.571
He knows
how to game the system.

44:33.604 --> 44:35.006
He is the system.

44:39.277 --> 44:42.213
And, yet...

44:42.247 --> 44:44.249
I will not accept

44:44.282 --> 44:48.419
that this problem
cannot be solved.

44:50.722 --> 44:53.992
I will not.

44:54.025 --> 44:56.561
Let's walk.

44:59.630 --> 45:01.532
(laughter)

45:01.566 --> 45:03.534
(indistinct conversations)

45:03.568 --> 45:04.770
You know, I...

45:04.803 --> 45:07.873
I don't really know
this part of town.

45:07.906 --> 45:09.540
No shit.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.089
What --

45:24.122 --> 45:26.257
Are you okay?

45:26.291 --> 45:28.226
D?

45:32.263 --> 45:35.433
D, what's -- what's --
what's going on with the...

45:35.466 --> 45:37.435
* Tell me, how you feeling?

45:37.468 --> 45:40.972
(slurring)
Got a cash card?

45:41.006 --> 45:45.076
Got a cash card?

45:45.110 --> 45:46.311
Yeah, yeah.

45:46.344 --> 45:48.980
If you want to buy something,
I've got cash.

45:49.014 --> 45:50.715
Use the machine,
brother.

45:50.748 --> 45:52.650
D, listen...

45:52.683 --> 45:54.786
Use the machine.

45:54.820 --> 45:56.221
* Beggars, man,
I get that dough *

45:56.254 --> 45:57.923
* All I see is Charlie Sheen

45:57.956 --> 46:00.325
* So I'm on my Emilio Estevez

46:00.358 --> 46:02.961
* Esteban, they don't be
what I be on *

46:02.994 --> 46:04.395
* Every track I poop up on

46:04.429 --> 46:06.097
* I turn it into Grey Poupon

46:06.131 --> 46:07.765
(ATM beeping)

46:07.799 --> 46:09.467
* Turn this to a panty raid

46:09.500 --> 46:11.102
* Tough act to follow like...

46:11.136 --> 46:13.638
Particular amount?

46:13.671 --> 46:16.107
Go big or go home.

46:16.141 --> 46:18.944
(ATM beeping)

46:18.977 --> 46:20.645
* Jesse James, all the same

46:20.678 --> 46:22.513
* But I gotta watch my back

46:22.547 --> 46:23.949
* When you make it to the top

46:23.982 --> 46:25.683
* They look like Casey Affleck

46:25.716 --> 46:27.018
* Oh, you want a beef with me

46:27.052 --> 46:28.854
* But really, I don't know you

46:28.887 --> 46:30.421
* Tell these Doug Funnies
that... *

46:30.455 --> 46:32.858
(indistinct conversations)

46:36.161 --> 46:37.996
There's a guy back there.

46:44.635 --> 46:46.872
Seriously.
There's a...

47:08.426 --> 47:10.261
(siren chirps in distance)

47:22.673 --> 47:24.575
Hey, D.

47:24.609 --> 47:26.811
That guy's back,
and he's got a friend.

47:26.844 --> 47:29.214
Two friends.

47:36.554 --> 47:37.923
Jesus.

47:37.956 --> 47:42.860
Jesus Christ, D.
This is -- This is not good.

47:42.894 --> 47:44.362
I don't like this.

47:47.798 --> 47:49.334
Are you fucking kidding?!

47:49.367 --> 47:51.769
You can stay here,
but I wouldn't recommend it.

47:58.776 --> 48:00.778
What --

48:07.818 --> 48:10.088
If anyone starts
shooting, duck.

48:10.121 --> 48:12.557
Otherwise,
don't fuckin' move.

48:20.966 --> 48:23.268
We need to borrow
some money.

48:26.304 --> 48:27.905
(knife plunges)

48:32.610 --> 48:33.945
Jesus!

48:57.202 --> 49:02.840
CHANCE:
Eldon Chance is a 55-year-old
right-handed neuropsychiatrist.

49:02.873 --> 49:05.076
Of late,
he is increasingly aware

49:05.110 --> 49:08.246
of a mental state he finds
to be dark and unstable.

49:08.279 --> 49:09.747
He fears he has been drawn

49:09.780 --> 49:12.450
to the precipice of some new
and terrible reality

49:12.483 --> 49:14.752
that now, having stumbled,

49:14.785 --> 49:17.755
he will be unable
to keep from falling.

49:17.788 --> 49:21.192
