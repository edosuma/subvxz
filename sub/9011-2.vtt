Ooh, great plan, Jerry.

16:48.925 --> 16:50.509
Bring the boy to me.

16:54.180 --> 16:56.014
You were always kind to me,
Morty.

16:56.099 --> 16:58.517
That's why I will leave
you with your testicles.

16:58.601 --> 17:02.688
From now on, you will be my best
friend and live by my side.

17:02.772 --> 17:04.231
Th-thanks, Snuffles.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.194
Begin phase two.

17:09.278 --> 17:11.196
NARRATOR:
Fighting continues as the dog

17:11.280 --> 17:13.448
army captures the
Eastern seaboard.

17:13.533 --> 17:16.493
It appears clear at this time
that the era of human

17:16.577 --> 17:19.579
superiority has come
to a bitter end.

17:19.664 --> 17:21.915
[ screams ]

17:21.999 --> 17:24.376
Please! Please don't kill me!

17:24.460 --> 17:25.293
[ muffled screams ]

17:25.378 --> 17:26.503
What's she saying, Bill?

17:26.587 --> 17:29.256
I think she's saying,
"I love lasagna."

17:37.390 --> 17:39.558
[ dogs barking, howling ]

17:47.942 --> 17:49.943
Mmm.

17:50.027 --> 17:51.570
Thank you, Fido.

17:51.654 --> 17:53.989
Rick!

17:54.073 --> 17:55.115
I thought you were dead!

17:55.199 --> 17:56.116
No, no, no,
I was just playing dead.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.367
Good news, though, Morty.

17:57.452 --> 17:58.493
This whole thing's
gonna be over really soon.

17:58.578 --> 17:59.369
What?

17:59.454 --> 18:00.454
It's a dream, Morty.

18:00.455 --> 18:01.663
We're in your dog's dream.

18:01.748 --> 18:02.988
The night the dogs captured us,

18:03.040 --> 18:05.250
after you cried and
crapped your pants, we...

18:05.334 --> 18:06.668
we all went to sleep.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.837
Then I used my dream inceptors
to put the two of us inside

18:08.921 --> 18:10.046
Snuffles' dream.

18:10.131 --> 18:11.673
But i-it's been
like a whole year!

18:11.758 --> 18:13.216
It's been six hours.

18:13.301 --> 18:15.427
Dreams move one one-hundredth
the speed of reality,

18:15.511 --> 18:17.512
and dog time is
one-seventh human time.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.397
So, you know, every day
here is like a minute.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.975
It's like "Inception," Morty, so
if it's confusing and stupid,

18:22.059 --> 18:23.685
then so is everyone's
favorite movie.

18:23.770 --> 18:24.770
Aw, man.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.146
I really liked this life.

18:26.230 --> 18:28.565
Well, at least I didn't
really crap my pants.

18:28.649 --> 18:30.650
No, no, that happened before
you went to sleep, Morty.

18:30.735 --> 18:32.611
You're sleeping in
your crap right now.

18:32.695 --> 18:34.404
Out of all the things that
happened to you,

18:34.489 --> 18:35.989
that was the only real
thing that, you know,

18:36.073 --> 18:37.532
is that you crapped your pants.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.159
I mean, it's a mess out there.

18:39.243 --> 18:41.828
I got some on my hands, Morty,
and then I got it on the dream

18:41.913 --> 18:43.663
inceptor, and a piece
fell in my mouth.

18:43.748 --> 18:44.915
Aw, man, geez!

18:44.999 --> 18:46.166
Seriously?

18:46.250 --> 18:47.667
Look, d-d-d-don't
worry about it, Morty.

18:47.752 --> 18:49.044
Here, here take these, Morty.

18:49.128 --> 18:49.961
Take these.

18:50.046 --> 18:51.254
[ gulps ]

18:51.339 --> 18:52.756
Are these pills supposed
to wake me up, or something?

18:52.840 --> 18:54.090
Close.

18:54.175 --> 18:55.258
It's gonna make your
kidneys shut down.

18:55.343 --> 18:56.384
What?!

18:56.469 --> 18:57.594
It's necessary for the plan,
Morty.

18:57.678 --> 18:59.179
Don't even trip, dawg.

18:59.263 --> 19:01.598
[ monitor beeping ]

19:01.682 --> 19:03.183
It's pretty bad,
Emperor Snowball.

19:03.267 --> 19:04.867
We're gonna need to do another
operation.

19:04.936 --> 19:05.936
Anything.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.938
Anything for my precious Morty.

19:08.022 --> 19:10.102
Sir, as your accountant,
I must advise you that these

19:10.149 --> 19:13.026
medical expenses are putting you
in serious financial jeopardy.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.736
You could lose your Kingdom.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.197
To hell with my Kingdom,
Bean Counter.

19:17.281 --> 19:21.117
I would trade it all for my
human's health and happiness.

19:21.202 --> 19:23.119
Do you think they would
have done this for us?

19:23.204 --> 19:25.330
We are not them!

19:27.291 --> 19:30.043
We are not... them.

19:32.421 --> 19:33.505
[ barks ]

19:33.589 --> 19:37.467
[ gasps ]

19:37.552 --> 19:38.677
Assemble the troops.

19:38.761 --> 19:40.554
I've made a decision.

19:40.638 --> 19:44.266
Taking over the human's world
will lead to nothing but more heartbreak,

19:44.350 --> 19:46.476
more cruelty.

19:46.561 --> 19:49.896
Instead, we will go to a new
world and colonize it with a

19:49.981 --> 19:52.899
society of intelligent dogs...

19:52.984 --> 19:56.653
one that will not make the same
mistakes as humanity and one

19:56.737 --> 19:59.281
where pet insurance
will be mandatory.

19:59.365 --> 20:00.866
I'm gonna miss you, Snowball.

20:00.950 --> 20:05.537
You can call me Snuffles, Morty,
and I'm going to miss you, too,

20:05.621 --> 20:07.205
very much.

20:15.423 --> 20:16.256
[ sniffles ]

20:16.340 --> 20:17.173
Jerry?

20:17.258 --> 20:18.383
I'm sorry.

20:18.467 --> 20:20.552
It's just like the end of
"Old Yeller."

20:20.636 --> 20:22.512
Oh, Jerry.

20:22.597 --> 20:24.180
You mean because it
had dogs in it.

20:24.265 --> 20:25.307
Wow!

20:25.391 --> 20:28.351
A whole world populated
by intelligent dogs.

20:28.436 --> 20:29.269
I wonder what it'll
be like, Rick.

20:29.353 --> 20:30.770
I think it will be great, Morty.

20:30.855 --> 20:32.814
You know, it's g... i-i-i-i-it
could be developed in-into a

20:32.899 --> 20:35.817
very satisfying project
for people of all ages.

20:35.902 --> 20:38.570
I mean, I'd watch it, Morty,
for at least 1 1 minutes a pop.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.530
You know, may-maybe they'll
do it board-driven.

20:40.615 --> 20:43.116
You know, that's a real
comforting idea, Rick.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.367
[ sighs ]

20:44.452 --> 20:45.535
What do you know, Morty?

20:45.620 --> 20:46.620
What do you know?

21:17.735 --> 21:18.735
Hi, guys.

21:18.819 --> 21:20.320
I'm your new teacher
for Scary class.

21:20.404 --> 21:22.238
My name is Scary Mr. Johnson.

21:22.323 --> 21:23.114
[ chuckles ]

21:23.199 --> 21:24.574
Uh, actually, you know what?

21:24.659 --> 21:26.534
That's my dad's name,
so why don't you just

21:26.619 --> 21:28.870
call me Scary Glenn, yeah?

21:28.955 --> 21:30.330
[ students gasp ]

21:30.414 --> 21:31.831
So, anyway, I understand your
previous teacher was having you

21:31.916 --> 21:33.875
work on Fundamentals of Fear.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.627
Which is... what is that?

21:35.711 --> 21:37.003
[ chuckling ] You know?

21:37.088 --> 21:38.546
So, uh, here...
here's what I say...

21:38.631 --> 21:42.258
You can't learn anything until
you learn ...how to chill.

21:42.343 --> 21:44.010
Oooh!

21:46.472 --> 21:47.472
[ exhales deeply ]

21:47.515 --> 21:49.516
This is how you dream, bitch.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.479
It's a good-a show!
