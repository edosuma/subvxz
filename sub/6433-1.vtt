01:50.244 --> 01:52.878
And you are a part

to the manual?

08:05.586 --> 08:08.954
Okay, look, we know that
the shield draws its power

08:08.956 --> 08:10.755
From the Alpha Centauri
star system.

as addendum NQZ-437

- I've been meaning to read...
- I thought that was junk mail.

08:29.109 --> 08:32.510
Since I turned evil
and tried to poison the world.

08:32.513 --> 08:34.044
- Okay.
- That's the best excuse.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.679
- He wins.
- Anyway, I redirected

08:35.682 --> 08:39.751
The laser scope from
the Centauri system to Uranus.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.586
- I thought it was pronounced...
- <i>Uranus.</i>

08:41.587 --> 08:44.523
It makes the shield
appear to stay in place,

08:44.525 --> 08:45.824
Yet we can pass through it.

08:45.826 --> 08:47.893
- Steve, if you would.
- Oh, no. No, no, not today.

08:47.895 --> 08:50.529
Are you kidding me?

08:54.734 --> 08:57.836

Paracelsus from the warehouse,

But I'm gonna need some cover
when I go down there,

And I'm gonna need
another pair of hands.

will create a diversion

Achilles' arrow.

10:22.089 --> 10:23.088
[screaming]

10:23.090 --> 10:25.123
Jeez, Claude!
Whoa!

10:25.125 --> 10:27.792
[explosion]

10:30.997 --> 10:34.065
Not cool!
Not cool!

10:37.036 --> 10:38.303
You guys are just
gonna have to run faster.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.739
Try and fight his control
of your body!

10:40.741 --> 10:43.008
Oh, my god,
what a great idea, Steve!

10:43.010 --> 10:44.009
I wish I'd thought of that!

10:44.011 --> 10:46.111
I can't fight it.
[grunts]

10:46.113 --> 10:48.647
And these are AL Capone's
machine guns!

10:48.649 --> 10:50.649
- What do they do?
- They shoot bullets! Run!

10:50.651 --> 10:53.218
Aah!
[machine gun fire]

10:55.121 --> 10:58.323
Oh, thank god.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.725
- Is it safe?
- Probably not.

11:00.727 --> 11:03.294
Oh, that's a definite no.

11:03.296 --> 11:05.697
This was
from Hitler's bunker...

11:05.699 --> 11:07.432
So it'll probably
blow up twice!

11:07.434 --> 11:09.734
[explosion]

11:09.736 --> 11:10.969
[explosion]

11:10.971 --> 11:13.171
Yeah, twice.

11:15.107 --> 11:18.376
So this is where
we disconnect Paracelsus?

11:18.378 --> 11:22.213
We've got to put the fires
back in the alcoves

11:22.215 --> 11:25.083
And get the Nordic symbols
back on all the walls.

11:25.085 --> 11:26.885
So Abigail
was certain about this?

11:26.887 --> 11:29.387
Not entirely.

11:29.389 --> 11:32.090
We've never had a caretaker
this strongly connected.

11:32.092 --> 11:35.860
But we don't have a plan "b,"
so let's give these a try.

11:35.862 --> 11:36.995
Oh, Artie,
those are beautiful...

11:36.997 --> 11:40.765
No!
Do not look in the mirrors!

11:40.767 --> 11:42.734
They're 4,000 years old.

11:42.736 --> 11:45.003
They belonged to an Akkadanian
emperor, Sargon the great.

11:45.005 --> 11:47.472
Legend has it that he used these
to reflect sunlight

11:47.474 --> 11:51.176
Into the eyes of his enemies,
the Sumerians, blinding them!

11:51.178 --> 11:53.078
Okay, I don't see
any Sumerians around,

11:53.080 --> 11:54.746
So what is the plan?

11:54.748 --> 11:58.950
We will simultaneously
reflect these flames

11:58.952 --> 12:02.120
Into the adjoining alcoves,
reigniting them.

12:02.122 --> 12:04.289
What happens if it's
not exactly simultaneous?

12:04.291 --> 12:07.092
Unclear.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.493
The flames will probably
consume us both.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.395
That sounds pretty clear to me.

12:10.397 --> 12:13.131
If Abigail is right,
then the other two alcoves...

12:13.133 --> 12:16.201
They're gonna reignite,
and that'll restart the symbols,

12:16.203 --> 12:19.170
And it'll disconnect Paracelsus
from the warehouse.

12:19.172 --> 12:21.873
- If Abigail is right.
- It is not an exact science.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.374
I know.
I miss exact science.

12:23.376 --> 12:24.375
On three.

12:24.377 --> 12:26.411
And one, two...

12:26.413 --> 12:28.046
Wait!

12:28.048 --> 12:30.782
[sneezes]

12:30.784 --> 12:31.950
[sighs]

12:31.952 --> 12:33.785
There's a lot of dust
down here!

12:33.787 --> 12:37.188
Two, three!

12:50.469 --> 12:53.805
What about the other two?

12:56.375 --> 12:59.410
- It's a dead end.
- I'm really sorry.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.881
No! No!

13:02.883 --> 13:05.984
Artie, the other two...
they're not igniting!

13:05.986 --> 13:08.386
Wait.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.421
Wait.

13:10.423 --> 13:12.991
Wait.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.960
Oh, come on!

13:15.962 --> 13:17.128
Ah!

13:17.130 --> 13:19.931
[laughs]
yes!

13:23.302 --> 13:25.370
[gasps]

13:29.308 --> 13:31.075
He's not controlling me
anymore!

13:31.077 --> 13:33.578
Well, they sure took
their sweet time.

13:33.580 --> 13:37.182
I should've killed them
when I...

13:37.184 --> 13:39.384
No.
[laughs]

13:39.386 --> 13:43.021
It doesn't matter.

13:43.023 --> 13:44.823
[laughter]
oh, my god!

13:44.825 --> 13:46.524
So what's Paracelsus
been up to?

13:46.526 --> 13:48.526
You're gonna hate this.

13:48.528 --> 13:51.296
- A time machine?
- H.G. Wells' time machine?

13:51.298 --> 13:53.131
But that only sends
your consciousness back in time.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.332
Why would he want that?

13:54.334 --> 13:57.468
A bunch of different artifacts
and connecting them to it.

13:57.470 --> 13:59.938
Yeah, yeah, he was trying
to get me to mix together

13:59.940 --> 14:02.407
A couple artifacts when
I was trying to save my...

14:02.409 --> 14:03.441
Ass.

14:03.443 --> 14:06.911
My ass.
My... 'cause when...

14:06.913 --> 14:08.580
Continue.

14:08.582 --> 14:11.216
Uh, he's set up at the same
spot Sykes found the portal.

14:11.218 --> 14:12.483
He forced me to help him.

14:12.485 --> 14:14.319
So after we set up
h.G.'s time machine,

14:14.321 --> 14:15.954
He rigged up the Tesla coil
to power it.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.388
And then he started
with different artifacts.

14:17.390 --> 14:20.024
There was a telescope
from the <i>marquis de LaPlace.</i>

14:20.026 --> 14:21.926
French astronomer
and mathematician.

14:21.928 --> 14:24.395
To postulate the existence
of black holes.

14:24.397 --> 14:25.630
- What else?
- Pocket watch...

14:25.632 --> 14:27.332
Belonged to Karl Schwarzschild.

14:27.334 --> 14:30.301
Yeah, provided
the first exact solution

14:30.303 --> 14:32.637
To Einstein's field equations
of general relativity.

14:32.639 --> 14:37.442
The last thing
was a very old sundial.

14:37.444 --> 14:40.211
Theodosius of Bithynia.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.380
I'm so glad people today
have names like Dave.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.482
He was, uh,
the Greek astronomer, right?

14:44.484 --> 14:47.552
Three very
powerful artifact cogs

14:47.554 --> 14:50.154
In a possible machinery

14:50.156 --> 14:52.223
That lets you
travel through time.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.591
So that's why
he's at the portal.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.593
He's planning a trip.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.161
But to where and to when?

14:57.163 --> 14:59.297
Yeah, it doesn't matter.
We've got to stop him.

14:59.299 --> 15:00.531
Right, we'll meet
at the portal.

15:00.533 --> 15:02.300
Pete, you three stop
and pick up the arrow

15:02.302 --> 15:03.902
That killed Achilles.

15:03.904 --> 15:05.270
It wouldn't hurt to pick up
a couple guns too.

15:05.272 --> 15:08.273
Myka and I have
to pick something up first.

15:08.275 --> 15:09.307
What?

15:09.309 --> 15:10.541
I'll explain later.

15:10.543 --> 15:13.244
- Go.
- Jeez.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.579
[grunts]

15:14.581 --> 15:17.649
[electricity crackling]

15:38.103 --> 15:40.505
[laughs,
clapping hands]

15:40.507 --> 15:42.140
Hey, he's going through it.

15:42.142 --> 15:44.175
Pete, shoot.

15:44.177 --> 15:48.046
[grunts]
you lose again, agent Lattimer.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.315
Welcome to the new world order.

15:50.317 --> 15:54.052
You're not gonna get away
with this!

15:54.054 --> 15:56.287
- Wait.
- Take this.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.555
Ow.

15:57.557 --> 16:01.259
[rumbling]

16:17.743 --> 16:19.610
Artie, what just happened?

16:19.612 --> 16:22.313
- I'm not s...
- Wait a minute.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.315
Did he... uh, Pete?

16:24.317 --> 16:26.551
Yeah?

16:26.553 --> 16:29.220
Whoa.

16:29.222 --> 16:32.490
Artie, look.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.392
His face...

16:34.394 --> 16:36.728
It's on all the banners.

16:36.730 --> 16:40.365
He was caretaker
of the last five warehouses.

16:40.367 --> 16:43.201
He did it.

16:43.203 --> 16:46.270
He did something
that changed everything.

16:56.081 --> 16:59.317
These banners clearly show
a series of warehouses,

16:59.319 --> 17:02.587
Which tells me he did not alter
history significantly,

17:02.589 --> 17:05.455
Because the same empires
still rose and fell.

17:05.458 --> 17:07.058
He was immortal
when he went back,

17:07.060 --> 17:08.726
Which would explain
why he's still around, right?

17:08.728 --> 17:10.461
You know,
I need to find that arrow

17:10.463 --> 17:12.530
And plunge it into his chest
by hand this time.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.332
Look at the motto
on the banners.

17:14.334 --> 17:18.069
<i>"Scientia sit omne."</i>

17:18.070 --> 17:19.404
"science is everything."

17:19.406 --> 17:20.570
He's focused the warehouse

17:20.573 --> 17:23.174
Entirely
on scientific pursuits.

17:23.175 --> 17:26.109
Sorry about
your steampunk, Artie.

17:26.112 --> 17:27.811
I want him dead.

17:27.814 --> 17:29.680
Yeah, but if the world
changed, why didn't we?

17:29.682 --> 17:31.315
That's why
we gave you the forks.

17:31.317 --> 17:33.084
See, the palace at Versailles
was known

17:33.086 --> 17:34.685
To experience time-slips.

17:34.687 --> 17:36.087
And Louis XIV's silverware

17:36.089 --> 17:38.156
Was somehow imbued
with the power

17:38.158 --> 17:41.759
To keep him and his court
in the same time continuum.

17:41.761 --> 17:45.530
[imitating Obi-wan Kenobi]
Luke, use the fork.

17:45.532 --> 17:48.666
[overlapping chatter]

17:48.668 --> 17:50.735
La, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.437
Don't try
and explain time travel.

17:52.439 --> 17:54.639
It never makes sense, and
it always makes my head hurt.

17:54.641 --> 17:57.075
We're here.
The world is different.

17:57.077 --> 17:59.544
Let's find parry
and kick his ass.

17:59.546 --> 18:03.381
Hey, guys, check this out...
very <i>minority report.</i>

18:03.383 --> 18:05.583
This is light-years
ahead of us.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.619
I mean, I can do some stuff,
but it's mostly...

18:08.621 --> 18:09.720
Good afternoon.

18:09.722 --> 18:10.721
[all gasp]

18:10.723 --> 18:12.356
Welcome to Warehouse 13.

18:12.358 --> 18:13.424
What the...

18:13.426 --> 18:15.426
How may I assist you?

18:15.428 --> 18:18.229
Wait, wait, wait.
That's a hologram.

18:18.231 --> 18:20.698
Programmed himself
as the guide.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.233
He's like
that annoying paper clip.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.268
Jeez, the ego on this guy.

18:24.270 --> 18:28.706
Claude, can you just
make him disappear?

18:28.708 --> 18:30.308
Oh, it looks like
his focusing on science

18:30.310 --> 18:31.709
Led to some improvements.

18:31.711 --> 18:33.744
Really? Like when
he created immortality

18:33.746 --> 18:35.646
By slaughtering
an entire village

18:35.648 --> 18:38.116
In 16th-century Constantinople?

18:38.118 --> 18:41.185
Or the 200 hospital patients
he murdered in cold blood?

18:41.187 --> 18:42.353
Or maybe not.

18:42.355 --> 18:44.455
Look at the rest of the motto.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.757
<i>"Media ad finem justificat."</i>

18:46.759 --> 18:48.326
"the end justifies
the means."

18:48.328 --> 18:50.228
Yeah, I don't want to think
about how many people

18:50.230 --> 18:52.363
He's killed
over the last 500 years.

18:52.365 --> 18:53.831
It's gonna take me hours
to hack this system.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.233
I mean, the way
it responds to me...

18:55.235 --> 18:57.702
It's like it's organic,
it's thinking.

18:57.704 --> 18:59.670
I got to get to the hub.

18:59.672 --> 19:01.205
Maybe that way I can get him.

19:01.207 --> 19:02.507
Yeah, yeah, no,
wait, wait, wait.

19:02.509 --> 19:04.709
I'm gonna need you
to reconstruct his time machine.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.744
No, no, no, I can walk you,
Myka, and Steve through it.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.479
Pete and I need
to get to the hub.

19:08.481 --> 19:12.750
So Pete and Myka can follow him
back through the portal

19:12.752 --> 19:13.918
And stop him from doing it.

19:13.920 --> 19:16.354
And since when do you decide
who does what?

19:16.356 --> 19:18.356
I just think we should make
an informed decision,

19:18.358 --> 19:21.926
You know, like, about
dead relatives, don't you?

19:21.928 --> 19:24.495
Uh...

19:30.202 --> 19:32.403
Judging by the way
these fiber optics

19:32.405 --> 19:34.672
Are joining up,
I'd say the hub can't be...

19:34.674 --> 19:36.807
So you want to tell me
what that was all about?

19:36.809 --> 19:37.942
What?

19:37.944 --> 19:39.777
You, Artie, tension,

19:39.779 --> 19:41.746
Informed decisions
and dead relatives?

19:41.748 --> 19:43.948
I'm sorry... I left
my Claudia/Artie code book

19:43.950 --> 19:45.683
In my other pants, so spill.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.719
[footsteps approaching]

19:53.659 --> 19:55.626
Oh, man.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.428
They have Borgs here?

19:57.430 --> 19:58.930
Why does
the creepy killer's warehouse

19:58.932 --> 20:00.665
Get to be cooler than ours?

20:00.667 --> 20:02.466
What's on their eyes?

20:02.468 --> 20:04.702
Oh, that's an artifact
from warehouse 12.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.270
Uh, Chester Moore hall?

20:06.272 --> 20:07.438
Oh, right, his achromatic lens,

20:07.440 --> 20:10.942
I thought there was
just one of those.

20:10.944 --> 20:13.611
[electricity crackling]

20:13.613 --> 20:14.912
- What?
- Oh, man.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.647
That's the spine of Saracen.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.549
That's the first artifact
that almost killed me.

20:18.551 --> 20:19.984
And now there are four of 'em.

20:19.986 --> 20:21.752
He's replicating artifacts,

20:21.754 --> 20:24.455
Artifacts that create
unstoppable soldiers.

20:24.457 --> 20:26.857
Very good, gentlemen.

20:29.995 --> 20:32.230
Holy crap, it's Valda.

20:32.232 --> 20:34.832
You can feel my commands
without my having to voice them.

20:34.834 --> 20:37.435
What is Benedict Valda
doing here?

20:37.437 --> 20:39.570
He died in Egypt
in a pit of fire.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.405
Not in this reality he didn't.

20:41.407 --> 20:42.940
I guess the warehouse
attracts the same people,

20:42.942 --> 20:44.508
- No matter what.
- Oh, great.

20:44.510 --> 20:46.010
Maybe MacPherson
and Walter Sykes

20:46.012 --> 20:48.012
Are running the snack bar.

20:58.557 --> 20:59.757
Okay, let's go.

20:59.759 --> 21:02.260
- Wait, Claudia. Claudia, wait!
- What?

21:02.262 --> 21:04.862
Do you think
there's a snack bar?

21:10.669 --> 21:12.036
Okay, the time machine's
set up.

21:12.038 --> 21:13.404
What else do we need?

21:13.406 --> 21:14.839
Telescope, watch...
both: Sundial.

21:14.841 --> 21:16.540
Yeah.
Now, you two have...

21:16.542 --> 21:19.443
[distant screaming]

21:19.445 --> 21:20.778
What is that?

21:20.780 --> 21:24.849
[screaming continues]

21:28.553 --> 21:30.621
[grunting]

21:30.623 --> 21:32.890
[panting]

21:32.892 --> 21:37.061
Pete said that was what
Paracelsus liked to do,

21:37.063 --> 21:38.929
Was combine artifacts.

21:38.931 --> 21:42.033
[screaming]

21:46.071 --> 21:47.638
Artie, are you all right?

21:47.640 --> 21:49.040
Yeah, I'm fine.

21:49.042 --> 21:50.975
It's just that I remember

21:50.977 --> 21:54.045
Things my parents
used to say...

21:54.047 --> 21:56.981
The kind of things
that the doctors used to do...

21:56.983 --> 21:59.817
In the camps during the war.

22:01.520 --> 22:05.089
He's turned my warehouse
into a world of endless terror.

22:05.091 --> 22:07.825
Well, then let's go stop him.

22:19.504 --> 22:21.372
Good to know locks
haven't changed that much.

22:21.374 --> 22:24.442
Or that I can pick any lock,
even a futuristic one.

22:24.444 --> 22:25.976
Now, if we can just
find the mainframe,

22:25.978 --> 22:27.912
Hopefully I can...

22:27.914 --> 22:29.880
Abigail!

22:31.683 --> 22:33.117
Doc, are you okay?

22:33.119 --> 22:34.919
What... what did they...

22:34.921 --> 22:36.554
What is your request?

22:36.556 --> 22:38.356
I think we found
the organic element

22:38.358 --> 22:39.924
I kept running into.

22:39.926 --> 22:41.859
Huh?

22:43.495 --> 22:46.731
Paracelsus actually found
a way to harness a human brain

22:46.733 --> 22:48.499
For computer power.

22:48.501 --> 22:50.034
Okay, Claude,
we got to get her out of this.

22:50.036 --> 22:51.902
No, no, no, no,
not knowing how she's wired,

22:51.904 --> 22:53.904
We'd likely kill her
by doing that,

22:53.906 --> 22:55.606
But maybe she can help.

23:00.812 --> 23:02.980
[keyboard beeping]

23:06.818 --> 23:09.086
I'm sorry.
That information is classified.

23:09.088 --> 23:11.555
Okay.

23:11.557 --> 23:14.759
[keyboard beeping]

23:15.861 --> 23:18.396
I'm sorry.
That information is classified.

23:18.398 --> 23:20.631
Shall I contact Dr. Paracelsus
for clearance?

23:20.633 --> 23:22.900
Both: No, no, no, no.
- Thank you.

23:22.902 --> 23:25.536
[sighs] there's got to be some,
like, low-level info

23:25.538 --> 23:27.805
- That could help us.
- Okay, let's just...

23:27.807 --> 23:28.939
Tiptoe, okay?

23:28.941 --> 23:30.408
[whispering]
sneaky, sneaky quiet.

23:30.410 --> 23:32.143
Okay.

23:36.948 --> 23:39.683
That Tesla coil
may not have enough juice in it

23:39.685 --> 23:41.085
To keep the portal open

23:41.087 --> 23:42.920
Long enough for Pete and Myka
to come back through.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.088
We're gonna have
to start looking

23:44.090 --> 23:45.089
For another power source.

23:45.091 --> 23:46.457
[wind whooshes]

23:46.459 --> 23:47.591
What was that?

23:47.593 --> 23:49.093
Well, even though
the fork's masked

23:49.095 --> 23:51.061
Our physical presence here,
we're moving artifacts around,

23:51.063 --> 23:52.930
So Claudia
was able to cloak that

23:52.932 --> 23:55.199
By hacking
into the f.I.S.H., but...

23:55.201 --> 23:57.067
Yeah, there's
a power drain there too.

23:57.069 --> 24:00.571
- June 10, 1541.
- Myka, set the date.

24:00.573 --> 24:01.939
Pretty sure
he went to Warehouse 9.

24:01.941 --> 24:03.808
- How can you tell?
- Because on June 10th...

24:03.810 --> 24:05.075
All of the regents
of Warehouse 9

24:05.077 --> 24:08.679
And we all know who likes
to kill large groups of people

24:08.681 --> 24:11.816
And there were never any
regents appointed ever again.

24:11.818 --> 24:14.819
The caretaker ran the warehouse
and supervised.

24:14.821 --> 24:16.720
Well, that would explain
all the changes.

24:16.722 --> 24:18.122
Okay, you guys, no more time.

24:18.124 --> 24:21.792
Throw the switches.

24:27.165 --> 24:29.567
You two... you're gonna have to go
back to Warehouse 9.

24:29.569 --> 24:31.235
You're gonna have to find him.

24:32.704 --> 24:35.639
Damn it.
We lost the f.I.S.H.

24:35.641 --> 24:38.108
[electricity crackling
and popping]

24:38.110 --> 24:39.910
Intruder.

24:39.912 --> 24:43.047
There is an intruder
in the warehouse.

24:43.049 --> 24:44.682
Intruder.

24:44.684 --> 24:47.618
There is an intruder
in the warehouse.

24:49.020 --> 24:52.223
Okay, Pete, Myka, go back!
Stop him!

24:52.225 --> 24:55.559
Claudia, you and Steve keep the
portal open till they get back!

24:55.561 --> 24:56.894
What are you gonna...

24:56.896 --> 24:58.896
Hey, jackboots.

24:58.898 --> 25:01.832
I'm guessing
I'm just your type.

25:05.504 --> 25:06.704
- Artie!
- Claude, Claude!

25:06.706 --> 25:08.572
He's probably gonna need you
not captured

25:08.574 --> 25:10.574
So you can go and rescue him,
don't you think?

25:10.576 --> 25:11.976
Yeah, right.
You guys, go.

25:16.114 --> 25:18.249
We'll fix this, Claude.
Pete, come on.

25:18.251 --> 25:20.551
Hey, hey, you guys, save Artie.

25:20.553 --> 25:23.220
I'm guessing
because we have these forks,

25:23.222 --> 25:26.557
We probably stay dead
in either time continuum.

25:26.559 --> 25:29.960
No, no, no, no,
no time-travel talk.

25:35.233 --> 25:38.702
Ooh, I bet I'm gonna
get blamed for that.

25:38.704 --> 25:41.105
Yes, that's very likely.

25:41.107 --> 25:43.707
[gasps]
prepare to die.

25:49.681 --> 25:51.815
Okay, look, I'm really sorry
about the arrow,

25:51.817 --> 25:53.951
And I'm sure my partner
had a perfectly good reason

25:53.953 --> 25:55.586
For killing all these guys.

25:55.588 --> 25:57.221
Pete, I did not kill
those guys.

25:57.223 --> 25:59.690
Silence!
Or I shall silence you.

25:59.692 --> 26:01.258
Okay, off on the wrong foot.

26:01.260 --> 26:05.563
I'm special agent Pete Lattimer
from Warehouse 13.

26:05.565 --> 26:08.899
Lisa Davinci...
agent of Warehouse 9.

26:08.901 --> 26:10.834
Great.
Lisa Da...

26:10.836 --> 26:13.237
Davinci?
As in... as in Leonardo?

26:13.239 --> 26:14.972
He was my grandfather.

26:14.974 --> 26:16.707
Really?
That's amazing.

26:16.709 --> 26:19.710
Yeah, I mean, if you have
anything that he's ever drawn,

26:19.712 --> 26:21.979
Hold on to it, 'cause it's gonna
go through the roof and...

26:21.981 --> 26:23.581
- Pete.
- Right.

26:23.583 --> 26:26.984
Lisa, what I'm about to tell you
is gonna blow your mind.

26:26.986 --> 26:30.588
We are time travelers...

26:30.590 --> 26:32.756
From the future.

26:32.758 --> 26:33.958
Really? Nothing?

26:33.960 --> 26:35.593
Can't I even get
an "oh, my god"?

26:35.595 --> 26:38.095
Oh, my god,
what took you so long?

26:38.097 --> 26:41.365
My grandfather's been working on
time travel for over 40 years.

26:41.367 --> 26:43.233
Well, we've been working
on stuff, too,

26:43.235 --> 26:47.204
Like, uh, movies and television
and popcorn.

26:47.206 --> 26:48.806
Huh?
I bet you don't have that.

26:48.808 --> 26:51.208
You two are nothing more
than strangely dressed killers

26:51.210 --> 26:52.376
From the future.

26:52.378 --> 26:55.012
Strangely dressed?
These are Prada.

26:55.014 --> 26:58.215
[Lisa grunts]
[breathing heavily]

26:58.217 --> 26:59.817
- Okay.
- Good one.

26:59.819 --> 27:01.085
Thank you.

27:01.087 --> 27:03.621
Look, we did not kill
these men, all right?

27:03.623 --> 27:05.723
- Paracelsus did.
- Paracelsus?

27:05.725 --> 27:07.391
That's impossible.

27:07.393 --> 27:11.395
He was encased in bronze
this very day.

27:11.397 --> 27:13.063
Mr. Valda.

27:13.065 --> 27:15.265
Mr. Valda,
this is... this is wrong!

27:15.267 --> 27:18.869
The warehouse doesn't use
artifacts like this!

27:18.871 --> 27:20.404
The warehouse has been a leader

27:20.406 --> 27:22.973
In human experimentation
for centuries.

27:22.975 --> 27:24.675
No, no.

27:24.677 --> 27:26.343
This is a false continuum.

27:26.345 --> 27:28.846
People who believe
in multiple realities

27:28.848 --> 27:30.280
Are generally
considered insane.

27:30.282 --> 27:32.950
We have several artifacts
that can cure that.

27:32.952 --> 27:34.351
Listen to me.

27:34.353 --> 27:37.287
This is the day, isn't it?

27:37.289 --> 27:39.223
I'd almost forgotten.

27:39.225 --> 27:43.293
This is the day
when I changed everything.

27:43.295 --> 27:46.697
500 years
and you've learned nothing!

27:46.699 --> 27:48.999
Just another
single-minded ideologue

27:49.001 --> 27:50.701
Turning science into fascism.

27:50.703 --> 27:53.037
Well, I've replaced
your creaky old storage unit

27:53.039 --> 27:55.973
With a state-of-the-art
research facility.

27:55.975 --> 27:58.409
I'm sure it will have impressed
your associates.

27:58.411 --> 28:00.144
I'm here alone.
There's no one else.

28:00.146 --> 28:03.080
I don't even know
h-how I got here.

28:03.082 --> 28:06.116
Oh, now you're
just being forgetful.

28:06.118 --> 28:08.852
Major Valda, shall we have
the doctors see

28:08.854 --> 28:10.320
Which combination of artifacts

28:10.322 --> 28:13.724
Might jog
agent Nielsen's memory?

28:16.429 --> 28:21.298
You will be thrilled to see
how much can be learned

28:21.300 --> 28:23.934
When we use artifacts as tools

28:23.936 --> 28:26.870
Rather than collectibles.

28:26.872 --> 28:29.406
Quite useful to mankind.

28:29.408 --> 28:31.341
Doctors.

28:31.343 --> 28:33.811
We have a new volunteer?

28:36.915 --> 28:38.482
There...

28:38.484 --> 28:40.084
Jack Lalanne's stationary bike
should be enough

28:40.086 --> 28:43.153
Jumper cables again...
what could possibly go wrong?

28:43.155 --> 28:44.421
I'm gonna go save Artie.

28:44.423 --> 28:46.023
Well, how long do I have
to keep pumping?

28:46.025 --> 28:47.257
Till Pete and Myka get back.

28:47.259 --> 28:48.992
Ride with your ass,
not your knees.

28:48.994 --> 28:50.828
Always do.

28:50.830 --> 28:51.895
♪ Crazy

28:51.897 --> 28:54.298
No, I know.
I know I sound insane,

28:54.300 --> 28:55.866
But I... but I actually do
know you.

28:55.868 --> 28:57.201
I know you both very well.

28:57.203 --> 28:59.803
Vanessa, look at me.
Look, we're in love.

28:59.805 --> 29:01.405
I'd use any excuse to see you.

29:01.407 --> 29:03.340
You've removed my appendix
several times.

29:03.342 --> 29:05.075
Well, that must have been
some affair.

29:05.077 --> 29:06.176
What did we do
for our honeymoon...

29:06.178 --> 29:08.011
A kidney transplant?

29:08.013 --> 29:10.347
'Nessa, we've been married
this long.

29:10.349 --> 29:12.416
You've never touched
my appendix.

29:12.418 --> 29:14.118
Should I be hurt?

29:14.120 --> 29:15.252
Listen to me.

29:15.254 --> 29:17.387
Paracelsus
is abusing artifacts.

29:17.389 --> 29:19.189
He is torturing
innocent people.

29:19.191 --> 29:20.924
Keep your voice down.

29:20.926 --> 29:23.060
This is for the advancement
of science

29:23.062 --> 29:26.163
And the betterment of humanity.

29:26.165 --> 29:27.765
Yes, yes, it is.

29:27.767 --> 29:29.900
No, he's a murderer!

29:29.902 --> 29:31.902
Please be quiet.
Please.

29:31.904 --> 29:32.936
He's gonna hear you.

29:32.938 --> 29:35.773
So what?
So what if he hears me?

29:35.775 --> 29:37.441
Please, please.

29:41.079 --> 29:43.547
- You're afraid of him.
- We are not.

29:43.549 --> 29:46.150
We're good friends...

29:46.152 --> 29:49.553
Very good friends.

29:49.555 --> 29:51.421
You're lying.

29:51.423 --> 29:55.325
What are you not telling me?

29:55.327 --> 29:58.896
He has our children.

29:58.898 --> 30:01.799
Please just let us do our jobs.

30:01.801 --> 30:04.568
Now, this is
Joan of arc's helmet.

30:04.570 --> 30:06.436
- No.
- It will help you,

30:06.438 --> 30:08.172
And it won't hurt very much.

30:08.174 --> 30:10.140
No!
Hugo, you're lactose intolerant,

30:10.142 --> 30:11.909
You snore, you're afraid
to have a heart scan

30:11.911 --> 30:13.143
'cause heart disease runs
in your family.

30:13.145 --> 30:14.278
How do you know that?

30:14.280 --> 30:16.313
Vanessa, you've wanted
to be a doctor

30:16.315 --> 30:18.348
Since you were a little girl
and your family dog was killed

30:18.350 --> 30:21.285
And you couldn't save it.

30:21.287 --> 30:24.354
I've never told anyone that.

30:27.225 --> 30:31.028
So, 500 years after you guys
here at Warehouse 9 bronzed him,

30:31.030 --> 30:32.162
He got released.

30:32.164 --> 30:33.964
If the mirror
proves you truthful,

30:33.966 --> 30:35.199
I shall help in any way I can.

30:35.201 --> 30:36.900
Well, thank you
for trusting us a little.

30:36.902 --> 30:38.569
So how does this thing work?

30:38.571 --> 30:41.205
Well, when I hold the candle
against the mirror,

30:41.207 --> 30:44.241
It will show us the shadows
of recent events.

30:44.243 --> 30:46.310
Oh, like
the durational spectrometer.

30:46.312 --> 30:47.511
[chuckles]

30:47.513 --> 30:49.580
Oh, you're serious.
Are those real words?

30:49.582 --> 30:51.582
You have a great smile.
You busy after this?

30:51.584 --> 30:53.050
- Pete.
- Right.

30:53.052 --> 30:55.085
Lisa, if you would.

31:02.160 --> 31:04.394
[chuckles]

31:04.396 --> 31:07.130
Is someone there?

31:15.240 --> 31:17.074
[grunts]
Paracelsus?

31:17.076 --> 31:19.276
It can't be!

31:19.278 --> 31:20.978
Aah!

31:31.189 --> 31:33.123
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

31:33.125 --> 31:35.058
I told you
we didn't kill those guys.

31:35.060 --> 31:36.526
He's on his way
to murder the regents.

31:36.528 --> 31:38.462
We need to get to them
before he does.

31:38.464 --> 31:41.031
They're meeting today
to appoint a caretaker

31:41.033 --> 31:42.566
In place of Paracelsus.

31:42.568 --> 31:43.901
Where do they usually meet?

31:43.903 --> 31:45.235
I don't know.
They're very secretive.

31:45.237 --> 31:47.237
Well, some things never change.

31:47.239 --> 31:49.106
Well, if they're anything
like our regents,

31:49.108 --> 31:51.541
They meet in public,
everyday places,

31:51.543 --> 31:55.178
Um, like a coffee shop or
t.G.I. Friday's, olive garden.

31:55.180 --> 31:57.281
Of course!
That's it.

31:57.283 --> 32:00.083
- They're at the Olive Garden.
- Yes.

32:00.085 --> 32:01.218
Seriously?

32:01.220 --> 32:03.053
White-chocolate
raspberry cheesecake?

32:03.055 --> 32:05.389
Do not tease me!

32:07.492 --> 32:09.660
We have men scouring
every corner of the warehouse.

32:09.662 --> 32:11.228
If they're here,
we'll find them.

32:11.230 --> 32:13.263
Well, maybe agent Nielsen
is alone.

32:13.265 --> 32:15.599
The others...

32:22.307 --> 32:25.342
I need to see if some artifacts
have been moved.

32:25.344 --> 32:29.346
Come with me.

32:29.348 --> 32:31.315
Vanessa, now, you know
I'm telling the truth.

32:31.317 --> 32:32.482
I can see it in your eyes.

32:32.484 --> 32:34.584
I don't care
how you know what you know.

32:34.586 --> 32:36.186
We have to do this.

32:36.188 --> 32:37.721
Yes.
The pursuit of science

32:37.723 --> 32:40.457
Is the only thing that matters.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.592
Now, this is a spindle

32:42.594 --> 32:45.295
From the very first rack
that was ever used...

32:45.297 --> 32:47.264
In the tower of London.
Yes, I know.

32:47.266 --> 32:48.699
And that's
Bleckwenn's stethoscope.

32:48.701 --> 32:51.468
First physician that had
any success with truth serum.

32:51.470 --> 32:54.004
Good.
Then you probably also know

32:54.006 --> 32:55.739
That if used together,

32:55.741 --> 32:57.607
It might extract the truth.

32:57.609 --> 33:00.577
Yes.
It also might fry my brain.

33:03.281 --> 33:04.648
Claudia.
Thank god.

33:04.650 --> 33:06.149
Heartbreaking, isn't it?

33:06.151 --> 33:07.684
When someone you love,
someone you thought you knew

33:07.686 --> 33:09.052
Turns out to be someone else.

33:09.054 --> 33:10.454
I know you're upset
about your sister,

33:10.456 --> 33:12.089
But I'm not someone else.

33:12.091 --> 33:14.424
I'm still the same man
that's loved you like a father

33:14.426 --> 33:17.094
In electrified handcuffs
and kidnapped me.

33:17.096 --> 33:19.329
I'm just trying to protect you.

33:19.331 --> 33:21.431
You can't, Artie.

33:21.433 --> 33:23.066
You can't protect me anymore.

33:23.068 --> 33:24.601
You have to let me
make my own mistakes,

33:24.603 --> 33:25.769
And you have to let me get hurt

33:25.771 --> 33:27.237
If that's what's
supposed to happen.

33:27.239 --> 33:29.473
She's right, you know.

33:29.475 --> 33:32.509
But I'm afraid neither of you
will be protecting anyone.

33:32.511 --> 33:34.077
[gun clicks]

33:36.547 --> 33:39.483
I feel strongly
a temporary caretaker

33:39.485 --> 33:41.485
Be named from among us.

33:41.487 --> 33:43.520
The warehouse
must be protected.

33:43.522 --> 33:46.189
The true caretaker
will show himself

33:46.191 --> 33:47.557
In due course.

33:47.559 --> 33:49.793
<i>Et voila.</i>

33:49.795 --> 33:51.762
Paracelsus, how did you...

33:51.764 --> 33:54.431
- Guards!
- Your guards are dead.

33:54.433 --> 33:57.467
And how you cope
in the next few moments

33:57.469 --> 34:00.170
Will determine whether or not
you join them.

34:00.172 --> 34:02.472
[chuckles]
your days are over.

34:02.474 --> 34:06.410
You see, I intend to lead
the warehouse into the future...

34:06.412 --> 34:09.478
A future that will shake off
the chains

34:09.481 --> 34:13.350
Of fundamentalism,
ignorance, and myth,

34:13.351 --> 34:17.353
A future that
will proudly embrace science

34:17.356 --> 34:20.223
As the one true faith.

34:20.225 --> 34:22.726
So the question is,

34:22.728 --> 34:25.395
Are you with me,
or are you against me?

34:25.397 --> 34:27.797
I said,

34:27.800 --> 34:29.433
"are you with me?"

34:29.435 --> 34:30.833
No, we are not.

34:30.835 --> 34:34.737
No one person shall ever lead
the warehouse.

34:34.739 --> 34:36.606
- No, sir.
- Excellent.

34:36.608 --> 34:39.743
That makes this much easier.

34:39.745 --> 34:43.547
[creature roaring]

35:00.565 --> 35:04.434
Oh, a real Olive Garden.

35:04.436 --> 35:06.403
That elephant tusk...
what is it?

35:06.405 --> 35:09.272
A tribe in Africa used it
against its enemies.

35:09.274 --> 35:11.308
It's the tusk
of the only known elephant

35:11.310 --> 35:12.742
To have been killed
by a boa constrictor.

35:12.744 --> 35:14.411
All right,
let's get down there.

35:14.413 --> 35:17.547
[blows whistles]
dude!

35:17.549 --> 35:20.817
There goes our element
of surprise.

35:20.819 --> 35:23.487
- There goes Paracelsus.
- Wait. Wait.

35:23.489 --> 35:26.323
If you two approach that tusk,
you'll both be killed.

35:26.325 --> 35:28.158
Well, do you have
any purple goo or...

35:28.160 --> 35:29.893
[bird shrieks]

35:29.895 --> 35:31.361
What the hell was that?

35:31.363 --> 35:32.896
The purple Swamphen, of course.

35:32.898 --> 35:34.431
You guys, be careful.

35:34.433 --> 35:36.333
There's a giant, scary bird
heading our way.

35:36.335 --> 35:37.634
I know.
I called her.

35:37.636 --> 35:40.704
[bird shrieks]

35:47.211 --> 35:48.578
Thank you, Isabella.

35:48.580 --> 35:51.781
Paracelsus is probably
headed back to Warehouse 9.

35:51.783 --> 35:53.650
If he links up
to the Eldunari again,

35:53.652 --> 35:55.285
He'll be too powerful.

35:55.287 --> 35:57.220
Let's go.

35:57.222 --> 35:59.356
What the hell is an Isabella?

35:59.358 --> 36:00.891
Does the warehouse
in the future

36:00.893 --> 36:04.227
No longer use purple Swamphens
to subdue artifacts?

36:04.229 --> 36:06.730
- That's insanity.
- Guys, come on.

36:09.300 --> 36:12.302
Hey, Artie...

36:12.304 --> 36:15.505
Alice could be here in a flash.

36:15.507 --> 36:18.909
Hugo, before you do whatever
it is you're gonna do,

36:18.911 --> 36:23.480
Do you mind... I don't know...
snapping our picture?

36:26.717 --> 36:29.352
Whoa.
He was definitely here.

36:29.354 --> 36:31.488
Okay, Peter, you head
towards the Eldunari.

36:31.490 --> 36:34.257
Myka and I will circle around
in case he wavers in his course.

36:34.259 --> 36:35.525
She's bossy.

36:35.527 --> 36:37.427
- You love it.
- I do.

36:37.429 --> 36:39.429
Let's go.

36:43.367 --> 36:44.668
There goes the F.I.S.H.

36:44.670 --> 36:45.902
[alarm blaring]
intruder.

36:45.904 --> 36:50.307
Intruder in aisle 487-k.

37:10.728 --> 37:13.630
No, no, not this time.

37:13.632 --> 37:15.932
I got a score to settle.

37:18.636 --> 37:22.906
Intruder in aisle 487-k.

37:27.511 --> 37:29.546
You remember this?

37:32.683 --> 37:35.719
[grunting]

37:35.721 --> 37:38.788
[alarm continues blaring]

37:43.761 --> 37:45.328
Wait.

37:45.330 --> 37:46.396
Let me take him.

37:46.398 --> 37:49.366
No, no, he's mine.

37:52.436 --> 37:54.771
You don't deal in lies, huh?

37:54.773 --> 37:58.441
Huh? Do you remember
saying that to me, parry?

37:58.443 --> 38:00.710
Do you remember
dangling Myka's life

38:00.712 --> 38:04.047
Out in front of me?

38:04.049 --> 38:05.448
I did not lie.

38:05.450 --> 38:07.717
I believed she was dying.

38:07.719 --> 38:09.519
You know what I believe?

38:09.521 --> 38:12.055
I believe we're gonna have us
a nice Paracelsii

38:12.057 --> 38:13.523
In the bronze sector.

38:13.525 --> 38:15.525
Please d-don't, don't.

38:15.527 --> 38:16.826
You have no idea
what you are giving up,

38:16.828 --> 38:18.428
What you are stealing
from mankind.

38:18.430 --> 38:20.330
[shushing]

38:20.332 --> 38:23.633
You're gonna make
a nice para-bookends.

38:23.635 --> 38:26.369
Now let's go.

38:39.750 --> 38:40.917
You're gonna have to kill me.

38:40.919 --> 38:43.086
Well, I'm glad we agree
about that.

39:04.342 --> 39:06.009
Oh.

39:06.011 --> 39:07.577
Good.

39:07.579 --> 39:10.714
I hope that hurt!

39:12.683 --> 39:15.919
So then the problem was
we had two bronzed Paracelsii

39:15.921 --> 39:18.788
You know, I do have
better things to do.

39:18.790 --> 39:20.757
No, you don't.
No, you don't.

39:20.759 --> 39:23.626
So is Mrs. Frederic
reconnected?

39:23.628 --> 39:24.761
Yeah, yeah, she's back online.

39:24.763 --> 39:26.730
I just wish
I could shake this...

39:26.732 --> 39:27.931
Uh, I don't know.

39:27.933 --> 39:29.866
Shake what?

39:29.868 --> 39:33.403
Well, it's this feeling
that something is changing.

39:33.405 --> 39:36.740
I can't explain it,
but something has begun.

39:36.742 --> 39:38.842
It's good and bad.
I don't know. Never mind.

39:38.844 --> 39:40.610
It's not comforting,
definitely not,

39:40.612 --> 39:42.812
And I wish that you were lying.

39:42.814 --> 39:44.881
I wonder if this has something
to do with my trip.

39:44.883 --> 39:48.017
The regents have asked me
to meet them abroad...

39:48.019 --> 39:49.419
Very hush-hush.

39:49.421 --> 39:51.621
Oh, I always love that
about them.

39:51.623 --> 39:54.557
And here we are.

39:54.559 --> 39:55.658
Ta-da!

39:55.660 --> 39:58.395
[coughing]

39:58.397 --> 40:00.864
"Ralph Brunsky,
Egyptian terrorist."

40:00.866 --> 40:04.667
[sighs]
yeah.

40:04.669 --> 40:07.437
There, okay.

40:08.873 --> 40:10.473
[grunts]

40:10.475 --> 40:11.875
[laughs]
that's where you put him?

40:11.877 --> 40:13.910
Oh, hilarious.

40:13.912 --> 40:15.678
Now put him
in the bronze sector.

40:15.680 --> 40:17.080
Aw, dad!

40:17.082 --> 40:19.949
Now, or you're gonna
be grounded for a week.

40:21.952 --> 40:24.487
[chuckles]

40:26.824 --> 40:28.425
Question...

40:28.427 --> 40:31.561
Okay, I hate
that tone of voice.

40:31.563 --> 40:34.831
Why do you have that scalpel
you threw at Paracelsus?

40:34.833 --> 40:38.802
It was just in my pocket,
and sometimes I pick things up.

40:38.804 --> 40:40.670
You said
that you had two artifacts

40:40.672 --> 40:42.138
When you released Paracelsus.

40:42.140 --> 40:44.040
The scalpel was
one of them, wasn't it?

40:44.042 --> 40:46.810
Oh, my god, I feel like
I'm talking to Columbo.

40:46.812 --> 40:51.614
Lisa said that
it has curative properties.

40:51.616 --> 40:53.950
You brought it
to Paracelsus, didn't you?

40:53.952 --> 40:55.518
I don't remember, Myka.

40:55.520 --> 40:57.187
That was, like,
two time-travels ago.

40:57.189 --> 40:59.222
I heard what you whispered
into his ear

40:59.224 --> 41:01.925
At Warehouse 9, Pete.

41:01.927 --> 41:04.127
You did it for me, didn't you?

41:04.129 --> 41:07.664
- What?
- No. Why?

41:07.666 --> 41:10.233
No.
What?

41:10.235 --> 41:13.102
Okay, yeah,
maybe I did, all right?

41:13.104 --> 41:15.839
So sue me.
I didn't want you to die.

41:15.841 --> 41:20.176
So you risked
the warehouse and the world

41:20.178 --> 41:22.846
Just to save me?

41:22.848 --> 41:25.849
Well, yeah.

41:25.851 --> 41:26.850
- Don't.
- Ow!

41:26.852 --> 41:27.984
Okay?
[groans]

41:27.986 --> 41:30.487
We always
put the warehouse first.

41:30.489 --> 41:32.622
I am your partner.
I am not your girlfriend.

41:32.624 --> 41:36.226
All right, all right, jeez.

41:36.228 --> 41:40.163
I'm still gonna put you first.
Why don't you go punch that?

41:42.867 --> 41:44.901
Your plan to pull Alice
out of that mirror

41:44.903 --> 41:46.503
Would have absolutely worked,
you know.

41:46.505 --> 41:48.705
It was a brilliant,
brilliant idea.

41:48.707 --> 41:51.007
I haven't forgotten
about Claire.

41:51.009 --> 41:53.610
I want to know about my sister.

41:53.612 --> 41:54.978
I know.
You never forget anything.

41:54.980 --> 41:57.213
But could I maybe
just recuperate from all that

41:57.215 --> 42:00.049
For five minutes before...
I guess not.

42:01.886 --> 42:05.088
What?

42:05.090 --> 42:07.891
11.

42:07.893 --> 42:10.560
There should be 12.

42:10.562 --> 42:12.228
Hmm.

42:17.568 --> 42:19.702
[keypad beeping]

42:19.704 --> 42:20.970
[buzzing]

42:20.972 --> 42:24.040
