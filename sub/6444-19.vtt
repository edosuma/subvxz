00:07.440 --> 00:10.750
Yes. Yes, yes, I realize that your division
has been trying very hard...

00:10.920 --> 00:14.356
...but unfortunately,
this isn't grammar school.

00:14.520 --> 00:18.035
Efforts don't count.
You only get an A for results.

00:18.200 --> 00:21.272
Yeah, well, you know, if...
If I give you more time...

00:21.440 --> 00:24.955
...that will continue to reflect negatively
on Luthorcorp's balance sheets.

00:25.120 --> 00:29.193
So l... I wish you and your people
much success...

00:29.360 --> 00:31.476
...with a less demanding company.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.790
Yeah, well, thank you.

00:47.400 --> 00:48.674
<i>Hello, Lionel.</i>

00:57.080 --> 00:58.399
Alex, what are you doing?

00:58.920 --> 01:01.718
<i>Sorry, Alex is a little busy right now.</i>

01:01.880 --> 01:04.474
What the hell are you doing?
Who are you?

01:10.200 --> 01:12.077
<i>You're used to being in control.</i>

01:12.920 --> 01:16.959
<i>If you wanna regain it,</i>
<i>you're gonna have to play a little game.</i>

01:17.120 --> 01:21.830
<i>The 11:35 from Smallville to Metropolis</i>
<i>is running on time.</i>

01:22.000 --> 01:25.151
<i>Win the game, or you'll be</i>
<i>catching a ride the hard way.</i>

01:25.320 --> 01:28.312
- What game?
- <i>Hangman.</i>

01:28.480 --> 01:31.438
<i>Call out a letter. Guess the phrase.</i>

01:31.600 --> 01:34.512
<i>Lose the game, your life follows.</i>

01:34.680 --> 01:38.275
<i>Hurry, Lionel.</i>
<i>You only get an A for results.</i>

01:41.440 --> 01:43.874
- A.
- <i>Too obvious.</i>

01:46.120 --> 01:47.553
E.

01:48.800 --> 01:51.758
- O.
- <i>Lucky guess.</i>

01:51.920 --> 01:53.797
- T.
- <i>Wrong again.</i>

01:57.640 --> 01:58.993
- G.
- <i>Sorry.</i>

01:59.160 --> 02:00.513
- S.
- <i>Nope.</i>

02:03.960 --> 02:05.518
<i>Would you like a hint?</i>

02:05.680 --> 02:08.274
<i>It's a lesson I learned from you.</i>

02:10.240 --> 02:11.593
M.

02:11.760 --> 02:12.988
C.

02:13.160 --> 02:14.593
R, Y, N.

02:14.760 --> 02:17.433
No mercy!
The answer is "no mercy."

03:37.080 --> 03:39.799
Lionel's at my house constantly,
acting like he belongs there.

03:39.960 --> 03:42.394
From what you're telling me,
it sounds like your mom...

03:42.560 --> 03:44.630
...kind of invited the wolf
to come on in.

03:44.800 --> 03:46.711
We've tiptoed through these
tulips before.

03:46.880 --> 03:49.110
What if you're wrong?
What if Lionel doesn't know?

03:49.280 --> 03:52.113
The things he says to me,
the look in his eye. Chloe, he knows.

03:52.280 --> 03:55.238
Well, then he's probably using your mom
to get closer to you.

03:55.400 --> 03:58.233
He's always there, helping her,
offering advice.

03:58.400 --> 03:59.833
She's trusting him more and more.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.911
And she wouldn't
if she knew the truth.

04:02.880 --> 04:05.917
I know I need to tell her.
I was going to after I found out.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.958
- So, what stopped you?
- She's been through so much.

04:09.440 --> 04:11.351
Since my dad died, I just...

04:11.520 --> 04:14.034
I didn't wanna give her
one more thing to worry about.

04:15.040 --> 04:19.192
Well, by not telling her, you could
be putting her at risk of a lot worse.

04:30.880 --> 04:32.438
Chess?

04:32.600 --> 04:34.750
You haven't played chess in years.

04:34.920 --> 04:38.071
Why the sudden interest
in such a complex game?

04:38.240 --> 04:40.674
A friend of mine
wants to learn the finer points.

04:40.840 --> 04:44.071
I used to dismantle
your two-dimensional assaults...

04:44.240 --> 04:46.515
...with alarming regularity, remember?

04:46.920 --> 04:49.753
Maybe you should teach your friend
something less complicated.

04:49.920 --> 04:52.388
What about a game of hangman?
That's always fun.

04:52.880 --> 04:54.393
Thanks.

04:54.560 --> 04:55.913
I'll stick with chess.

04:56.080 --> 04:58.036
And you'll lose, as always.

05:00.880 --> 05:02.711
I'm not playing to win.

05:02.880 --> 05:04.313
I'm playing to instruct.

05:08.480 --> 05:10.391
No mercy?

05:10.920 --> 05:13.673
- What are you talking about?
- It was you, Lex.

05:13.840 --> 05:15.114
- I know it.
- What?

05:15.280 --> 05:18.078
Disabling my limo
in the path of an oncoming train.

05:18.240 --> 05:20.959
That kind of melodrama
went out of style with silent movies.

05:22.160 --> 05:24.037
Wait, someone tried to kill you?

05:24.200 --> 05:25.792
Is this the part
where you feign innocence?

05:25.960 --> 05:28.349
I brought you in
to help run LuthorCorp again.

05:28.520 --> 05:31.478
Profits have never been higher.
Why would I want you dead?

05:31.640 --> 05:35.110
Not so long ago, I tried
to take LuthorCorp away from you.

05:35.280 --> 05:37.077
- The Apex takeover.
- Right.

05:37.240 --> 05:41.153
Please. Seeing you fail miserably
was retribution enough.

05:43.680 --> 05:44.954
All right.

05:45.440 --> 05:46.998
All right.

05:48.720 --> 05:50.438
So it wasn't you.

05:52.200 --> 05:54.555
I may not like you very much, Dad...

05:54.720 --> 05:56.676
<i>...but</i> you're a valuable asset
to LuthorCorp.

05:56.840 --> 05:58.592
Killing you would hurt the bottom line.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.796
Your concern is truly touching.

06:07.360 --> 06:09.351
I am concerned.

06:09.880 --> 06:12.314
A threat against you
is a threat against LuthorCorp.

06:12.480 --> 06:16.234
I have been fending off attacks
on my life since before you were born.

06:16.400 --> 06:18.994
I think I can handle one more.

06:24.880 --> 06:28.316
Oh, Clark. What do you think
about this as a closing?

06:28.480 --> 06:31.677
"It isn't enough
to simply give when we can.

06:31.840 --> 06:35.310
Upholding the principles of truth, justice
and the American way...

06:35.480 --> 06:39.109
...isn't a matter of convenience.
It's a matter of conscience."

06:39.280 --> 06:41.032
Sounds like words to live by.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.839
Let's hope the deep pockets
at the fundraiser think so too.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.274
I need to talk to you.

06:45.440 --> 06:47.908
Can't it wait until tomorrow?
I gotta get to Metropolis.

06:49.120 --> 06:50.633
Lionel knows.

06:52.520 --> 06:53.794
Knows what?

06:55.520 --> 06:57.431
Lionel knows about me.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.234
About my secret.

06:59.720 --> 07:02.792
- I don't know how.
- I think I might.

07:03.240 --> 07:04.832
A while ago...

07:05.000 --> 07:07.195
...I found
a package on our doorstep.

07:07.360 --> 07:11.399
Inside was a video of you
surviving an explosion.

07:13.400 --> 07:16.756
- Who sent it?
- I'm not <i>sure...</i>

07:17.920 --> 07:19.592
...but Lionel took care of it.

07:22.120 --> 07:25.032
He said he wasn't interested
in why I was being blackmailed.

07:25.200 --> 07:27.270
He just wanted to help.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.474
And I believed him.

07:29.640 --> 07:31.995
Why didn't you tell me about this?

07:33.160 --> 07:36.470
You were still in so much pain
about your father.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.552
I guess l...

07:41.720 --> 07:44.871
I just wanted
to protect you for a change.

07:48.960 --> 07:52.191
Lionel's gonna be
at this fundraiser tonight.

07:52.360 --> 07:54.715
- When I see him...
- No, you can't say anything.

07:54.880 --> 07:56.677
We have to handle this
the way Dad would.

07:56.840 --> 07:58.796
Stick to our routine.
Give nothing away.

07:58.960 --> 08:00.632
Not until we know
what Lionel's up to.

08:02.640 --> 08:03.993
I better get going.

08:05.200 --> 08:06.792
- I'll go with you.
- No, no.

08:06.960 --> 08:10.714
If you start guarding me all the time,
he'll definitely know something's up.

08:10.880 --> 08:12.359
Don't worry.

08:12.520 --> 08:14.590
I can handle Lionel.

08:15.680 --> 08:17.079
Bye.

08:28.480 --> 08:33.270
Well, there are no concealed electronic
devices here in the office anywhere, sir.

08:33.440 --> 08:34.714
Office is clean.

08:34.880 --> 08:36.359
I hope so, for your sake.

08:36.520 --> 08:38.828
Or you'll find yourself working
in a convenience store...

08:39.000 --> 08:42.356
...watching hot dogs spin. Thank you.

09:10.680 --> 09:13.240
<i>Watching hot dogs spin?</i>

09:13.400 --> 09:14.913
<i>That wasn 't very nice.</i>

09:15.480 --> 09:18.074
<i>But that's the way you treat</i>
<i>the people who work for you...</i>

09:18.240 --> 09:19.958
<i>... isn 't it, Lionel?</i>

09:28.680 --> 09:30.398
What do you do, read lips?

09:30.560 --> 09:32.869
<i>I see everything.</i>

09:55.680 --> 09:57.477
<i>911.</i>

09:58.800 --> 10:01.598
<i>Hello, Lionel.</i>
<i>How does it feel to be helpless?</i>

10:01.760 --> 10:03.398
I'll let you know if it ever happens.

10:03.680 --> 10:07.355
<i>Now, that's that winning spirit</i>
<i>that made you a billionaire.</i>

10:07.520 --> 10:09.511
<i>Let's see if it can keep you alive.</i>

10:13.280 --> 10:15.032
So...

10:16.800 --> 10:19.598
...what do you want, huh?

10:33.120 --> 10:36.032
<i>I want to play another game.</i>

11:14.120 --> 11:15.838
<i>Hello again, Lionel.</i>

11:16.160 --> 11:17.434
Where am I?

11:17.600 --> 11:20.637
<i>In a hell of your own making.</i>

11:23.360 --> 11:24.349
Who are you?

11:24.520 --> 11:26.670
<i>Just another one of the many</i>
<i>faceless people...</i>

11:26.840 --> 11:28.432
<i>... your greed has destroyed.</i>

11:28.600 --> 11:30.795
That narrows it down some,
doesn't it?

11:30.960 --> 11:32.916
<i>You may not know me, Lionel...</i>

11:33.080 --> 11:34.399
<i>... but I know you.</i>

11:34.560 --> 11:37.074
<i>You're a man above it all...</i>

11:37.240 --> 11:41.279
<i>... commanding your workers</i>
<i>to carry the burden of your empire.</i>

11:41.440 --> 11:43.237
<i>They toil while you profit.</i>

11:43.400 --> 11:46.073
It's called running a business.

11:46.240 --> 11:47.992
That's how it works!

11:48.160 --> 11:49.513
<i>Not anymore.</i>

11:49.840 --> 11:52.195
<i>Now you're gonna have to get</i>
<i>your own hands dirty.</i>

11:53.920 --> 11:55.672
<i>Bright, isn 't it?</i>

11:56.120 --> 11:57.712
<i>Yeah.</i>

11:58.680 --> 12:01.672
<i>Oh, well now, what do we have here?</i>

12:01.840 --> 12:03.512
<i>Take a closer look.</i>

12:04.040 --> 12:05.632
<i>Go on.</i>

12:11.640 --> 12:14.359
<i>Not exactly spring water, is it?</i>

12:16.880 --> 12:19.110
<i>A good story always needs a hook.</i>

12:19.280 --> 12:20.918
<i>Wouldn 't you agree?</i>

12:21.080 --> 12:23.435
All right. So, what happens now?

12:23.920 --> 12:25.956
<i>Now we're gonna play another game.</i>

12:26.120 --> 12:27.838
<i>Would you like to see how it's played?</i>

12:28.000 --> 12:29.877
Yeah, show me.

12:30.960 --> 12:35.351
<i>These are the scales of justice.</i>

12:35.680 --> 12:39.719
<i>Fill the buckets</i>
<i>with the liquid from the tap...</i>

12:40.160 --> 12:41.718
<i>... and balance them on the pole.</i>

12:43.880 --> 12:47.714
<i>Succeed, and the door</i>
<i>to this room will open.</i>

12:50.840 --> 12:52.114
<i>Alex...</i>

12:52.280 --> 12:54.236
<i>... he didn 't do too well.</i>

12:56.760 --> 12:59.558
<i>Did I forget to mention</i>
<i>the liquid is highly flammable?</i>

13:07.560 --> 13:10.552
He was my driver, an innocent man.

13:10.720 --> 13:13.792
<i>No one connected to you is innocent.</i>

13:14.160 --> 13:16.151
- <i>Ready to play?</i>
- No.

13:16.320 --> 13:19.630
No, Lionel Luthor
doesn't jump through hoops.

13:19.800 --> 13:24.430
<i>In 10 minutes, flames beneath your feet</i>
<i>will consume this room.</i>

13:24.960 --> 13:26.598
<i>Balance the scales...</i>

13:26.760 --> 13:28.990
<i>... or burn for your sins.</i>

13:51.160 --> 13:52.957
Take your time.

13:53.280 --> 13:56.431
The key to mastering chess
is to anticipate your opponent's <i>moves...</i>

13:56.600 --> 13:58.431
...and keep him on the defensive.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.591
Lex, what are we doing?

14:01.000 --> 14:03.878
I thought we were enjoying
an evening of chess.

14:04.520 --> 14:05.794
I think I have Monopoly here.

14:05.960 --> 14:07.598
You know what I'm talking about.

14:09.160 --> 14:11.720
We've spent the last week
avoiding what happened.

14:12.240 --> 14:15.073
I was kind of waiting for you
to bring that up.

14:18.760 --> 14:20.352
You kissed me.

14:22.320 --> 14:25.357
And then you kissed me back.

14:29.080 --> 14:33.437
God, after all that talk about friendship
and not wanting to ruin what we have...

14:33.600 --> 14:36.592
<i>...we</i> really don't listen very well,
do we?

14:39.880 --> 14:42.997
Are you asking me
to forget what happened?

14:43.880 --> 14:45.916
Because short of
a serious blow to the head...

14:46.080 --> 14:49.755
<i>...I</i> think it's a memory
that's gonna linger for quite a while.

14:57.160 --> 15:00.038
You should get that.
I'm gonna go back to Metropolis.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.156
I'll call you later.

15:08.680 --> 15:10.238
What?

15:12.840 --> 15:15.149
Get a security team
and meet me at LuthorCorp Plaza.

15:15.320 --> 15:17.470
And keep this internal.

15:17.640 --> 15:20.473
I don't want anyone to know
my father's missing.

15:21.840 --> 15:24.195
<i>Getting a little warm?</i>

15:24.360 --> 15:26.271
<i>How does it feel?</i>

15:26.440 --> 15:30.319
<i>The flames licking at your heels.</i>
<i>Every step, blistering pain.</i>

15:33.280 --> 15:36.511
<i>I bet a pair of those thousand-dollar</i>
<i>Italian shoes you favor...</i>

15:36.680 --> 15:39.877
<i>... would really make a difference</i>
<i>right about now, wouldn 't they?</i>

15:41.160 --> 15:43.390
<i>I understand how hard</i>
<i>it must be for a man...</i>

15:43.560 --> 15:45.869
<i>... who 's not used</i>
<i>to breaking a sweat.</i>

15:47.360 --> 15:48.998
I grew up in Suicide Slums.

15:49.160 --> 15:51.549
Sweat's something
I'm very familiar with, my friend.

15:51.720 --> 15:54.678
<i>I know all about</i>
<i>your underprivileged youth.</i>

15:54.840 --> 15:58.435
<i>But that all changed when your</i>
<i>parents died in the fire you set.</i>

16:00.680 --> 16:02.511
<i>Oh, did I hit a nerve?</i>

16:02.680 --> 16:04.511
I didn't kill my parents.

16:04.680 --> 16:07.478
<i>Tell a lie long enough,</i>
<i>you'll believe it to be truth.</i>

16:10.120 --> 16:11.519
<i>You're running out of time.</i>

16:13.120 --> 16:14.838
<i>You wanna tell me</i>
<i>what you've learned...</i>

16:15.000 --> 16:18.709
<i>... from this little game before the flesh</i>
<i>is seared from your bones?</i>

16:18.880 --> 16:21.633
Yeah, you talk too much.

16:22.120 --> 16:23.792
Shut up.

16:28.960 --> 16:32.032
<i>Careful, careful.</i>

16:32.840 --> 16:35.229
<i>Remember what happened</i>
<i>to your limo driver.</i>

16:35.400 --> 16:39.439
<i>The scales of justice are hard to balance</i>
<i>with blood on your hands...</i>

16:39.600 --> 16:41.556
<i>... aren 't they?</i>

16:49.040 --> 16:52.077
<i>Congratulations on your acquittal.</i>

17:18.480 --> 17:20.071
<i>Lionel?</i>

17:23.560 --> 17:26.632
- What? Another game?
- <i>Yes.</i>

17:27.079 --> 17:29.514
<i>But for this one,</i>
<i>you're gonna need a partner.</i>

17:34.280 --> 17:38.831
<i>Someone to help you</i>
<i>through the dark times.</i>

17:40.280 --> 17:41.554
Martha.

17:44.200 --> 17:45.474
<i>Lionel!</i>

17:45.640 --> 17:46.914
<i>Lionel!</i>

17:56.680 --> 17:58.398
Lionel, please!

17:58.560 --> 18:00.357
Don't... Don't...

18:00.520 --> 18:02.750
Don't... Don't panic.

18:09.680 --> 18:11.750
- Martha?
- Lionel! What's...? What's going on?

18:11.920 --> 18:13.990
Someone is playing a very sick game.

18:14.160 --> 18:16.071
- Who?
- I don't know. How did you get here?

18:16.240 --> 18:19.073
I don't know! I was
in the parking structure at the Plaza...

18:19.240 --> 18:21.071
...and l... I heard this noise behind me.

18:21.240 --> 18:24.232
I don't know. Just please get me out!

18:25.160 --> 18:27.754
All right. All right. Martha, stand back.

18:30.480 --> 18:32.152
All right!

18:32.760 --> 18:35.991
All right! She's got nothing
to do with this. Let her go!

18:36.160 --> 18:38.230
<i>She has everything to do with this.</i>

18:38.400 --> 18:42.996
<i>You use your wealth to buy influence,</i>
<i>controlling the halls of power.</i>

18:43.160 --> 18:46.152
<i>You're the man in the shadows,</i>
<i>pulling all the strings.</i>

18:46.960 --> 18:48.279
<i>And your puppets...</i>

18:48.440 --> 18:50.476
<i>... they're as guilty as their master.</i>

18:50.640 --> 18:52.870
<i>And they deserve a similar fate.</i>

18:53.800 --> 18:57.475
All right. All right. So, what's this game?
How do I get her out, huh?

18:57.640 --> 18:59.915
<i>You use words as weapons.</i>

19:00.080 --> 19:01.593
<i>Twisting them to your purpose.</i>

19:01.760 --> 19:03.990
<i>Obscuring truth with double meaning.</i>

19:04.160 --> 19:05.878
<i>Now it's my turn.</i>

19:09.160 --> 19:13.472
"A toad like fever."
I don't understand this!

19:13.760 --> 19:15.716
<i>Shift your perceptions.</i>

19:17.040 --> 19:21.033
- Shift your...
- <i>Her life is in your hands.</i>

19:21.200 --> 19:24.192
No, wait! Wait! I need more! L...

19:29.120 --> 19:31.190
I understand the whole
acting-normal thing...

19:31.360 --> 19:33.794
...but ferreting out the truth
is acting normal for me.

19:33.960 --> 19:36.713
- Chloe...
- You're not the only one Lionel's playing.

19:36.880 --> 19:39.155
He fed me information
about Fine being in Honduras...

19:39.320 --> 19:41.231
...because he knew
I'd come to you with it.

19:41.400 --> 19:44.472
Why don't you let me use that as an in
to find out what he's up to.

19:44.640 --> 19:47.234
What if he finds out what you're up to?
It's too risky.

19:47.400 --> 19:50.631
Oh, and waiting for Darth Luthor
to hatch his evil plan isn't?

19:50.800 --> 19:52.074
Hey, Lois.

19:52.240 --> 19:54.390
No, she left hours ago.

19:57.600 --> 20:00.592
- I'll let you know if I hear anything.
- What is it?

20:00.760 --> 20:03.911
My mom never showed up
at the fundraiser in Metropolis.

20:04.520 --> 20:06.317
Oh, my God.

20:06.800 --> 20:09.314
Pull the security vids
for the last 24 hours.

20:09.480 --> 20:11.038
See if you can find
anything else unusual.

20:11.200 --> 20:12.519
Yes, sir.

20:15.160 --> 20:16.434
It's okay.

20:16.600 --> 20:18.830
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for your father.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.070
- Where is he?
- I wish I knew.

20:21.240 --> 20:22.958
He's missed meetings
and never showed up...

20:23.120 --> 20:25.076
...for a fundraiser at the Plaza.

20:25.840 --> 20:27.114
Neither did my mother.

20:28.840 --> 20:31.718
Lex, if you have any idea what's
going on, you better tell me now.

20:33.560 --> 20:35.516
Clark, earlier today,
my father accused me...

20:35.680 --> 20:38.148
...of orchestrating
some bizarre attempt on his life.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.117
Think someone's giving it
a second shot?

20:40.280 --> 20:42.396
All I know is that he was taken
from this office.

20:42.560 --> 20:43.834
How do you know that?

20:44.000 --> 20:46.036
I found his cell phone on the floor.

20:46.200 --> 20:48.794
Last call he tried to make was to 911.

20:49.680 --> 20:53.559
Time stamp on it matches an unexplained
gap in the building's security tapes.

20:55.920 --> 20:57.672
What about the cameras in here?

20:59.000 --> 21:00.274
There aren't any.

21:00.440 --> 21:03.637
My father liked to have a place where
he could conduct certain transactions...

21:03.800 --> 21:08.032
...without any electronic records.
- Would that be the less-than-legal kind?

21:18.880 --> 21:20.154
Lex?

21:20.320 --> 21:22.550
Has this always been chipped
liked that?

21:24.360 --> 21:27.796
My father wouldn't tolerate
a flaw in his prized collection.

21:28.920 --> 21:30.592
Nice catch.

21:36.160 --> 21:37.752
This isn't your standard issue.

21:37.920 --> 21:40.878
This was homemade by somebody
who really knew what they were doing.

21:41.040 --> 21:42.837
High res. Wireless carrier.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.673
- Is it transmitting?
- No, it's powered down.

21:45.840 --> 21:49.276
But if we juice it up, I might be able
to trace where it's located.

21:51.480 --> 21:53.038
Let's try it.

21:53.960 --> 21:56.952
"A toad like fever!"

21:57.120 --> 21:59.588
Fever? It doesn't...
It doesn't make any sense.

21:59.760 --> 22:01.876
It has to mean something!

22:02.040 --> 22:03.837
- Have you ever heard it before?
- No.

22:04.920 --> 22:07.718
Wait! Why aren't they all the same?

22:08.960 --> 22:10.791
The first letters of the words.

22:10.960 --> 22:12.598
The T and the F are capitals.

22:12.760 --> 22:15.069
But not the A in the beginning
and the L in "like"!

22:15.240 --> 22:17.276
T, F, right, right.
He said it was a... What?

22:17.440 --> 22:20.318
He said, "Shift... Shift...
Shift your perception."

22:20.480 --> 22:22.471
It... It... It's an anagram.

22:22.640 --> 22:25.074
It's an anagram!
The w... The true meaning is scrambled.

22:25.240 --> 22:28.073
- It's a word puzzle!
- A word puzzle.

22:31.440 --> 22:33.192
It's transmitting on a rotational code.

22:33.360 --> 22:36.432
I'll see if I can hack the sequence
and locate the termination point.

22:36.600 --> 22:38.033
Hurry.

22:38.200 --> 22:39.599
It's a shame, isn't it?

22:39.760 --> 22:42.638
It takes a crisis like this to get us
in the same room together.

22:43.920 --> 22:46.354
Look, Clark, maybe when
this is all over, we can...

22:46.520 --> 22:48.670
...try to find our way back
to some common ground.

22:54.400 --> 22:57.119
Excuse me. I need to take this.

22:59.320 --> 23:01.515
Is there anything I can do
to make this go faster?

23:01.680 --> 23:03.955
Not unless computer skills
are one of your abilities.

23:04.120 --> 23:07.590
The signal's strong. Minimal degradation,
which means it must be local.

23:08.720 --> 23:11.314
Got it. 8320 Vermont Avenue.
Five miles from here.

23:11.480 --> 23:12.754
Great.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.592
You find something?

23:16.280 --> 23:17.759
An address not far from here.

23:17.920 --> 23:20.957
Great. We'll take my Porsche.
It's a lot faster than your truck.

23:21.760 --> 23:23.034
Let's go.

23:28.040 --> 23:29.712
V-l-L. "Evil."

23:29.880 --> 23:31.552
"To dare fake evil."

23:31.720 --> 23:32.994
It's gibberish. It's...

23:33.160 --> 23:34.957
There's meaning in it!
There has to be!

23:35.120 --> 23:36.678
No, there's...

23:36.840 --> 23:39.798
You want me to fail, don't you?
You want me to watch her die?

23:39.960 --> 23:41.871
- Is that what you want?
- Lionel!

23:42.040 --> 23:44.076
He wants me to fail.

23:44.600 --> 23:47.831
Fail, fail, fail.

23:49.640 --> 23:50.914
Fail, all right. He said:

23:51.080 --> 23:53.548
"The truth is obscured
with double meaning. " Double.

23:53.720 --> 23:55.597
It's double meaning. No mercy.

23:56.960 --> 23:58.712
Greed, grab, take.

23:58.880 --> 24:01.713
Take, take, take. To take.

24:01.880 --> 24:03.836
Over. Takeover!

24:04.000 --> 24:07.515
Failed takeover! Failed takeover!
The answer is "failed takeover"!

24:07.680 --> 24:09.193
Failed takeover!

24:09.360 --> 24:11.157
Apex. Apex!

24:11.320 --> 24:13.072
Apex!

24:16.280 --> 24:17.952
It's Apex.

24:30.360 --> 24:31.839
Martha?

24:33.080 --> 24:34.638
Martha.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.592
Martha.

24:39.240 --> 24:41.037
You're all right.

24:41.200 --> 24:42.918
It's all right.

24:44.160 --> 24:46.993
<i>Genuine concern</i>
<i>for another human being?</i>

24:47.160 --> 24:51.438
<i>I suspected your relationship with</i>
<i>the senator was more than just political.</i>

24:53.560 --> 24:55.152
All right.

24:55.320 --> 24:56.799
All right.

24:58.800 --> 25:01.439
All right, we won your game.
Now let us out.

25:01.600 --> 25:02.874
<i>As you wish.</i>

25:07.560 --> 25:08.834
Come on, Martha.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.831
Wait, wait! Wait!

25:11.000 --> 25:13.594
- What's...? What's up here?
- <i>Freedom.</i>

25:15.880 --> 25:18.713
<i>Or death, depending on the outcome</i>
<i>of your final game.</i>

25:18.880 --> 25:21.235
You expect us to walk
right into another trap?

25:21.400 --> 25:24.790
<i>You could stay right where you are</i>
<i>and wait for the floor to be electrified.</i>

25:29.240 --> 25:30.673
Come on.

25:39.320 --> 25:41.311
- What happens now?
- I don't know.

25:41.480 --> 25:43.994
No! No!

25:52.560 --> 25:55.711
I'm sorry that you got dragged
into this.

25:55.880 --> 25:57.791
Dragged into what? Who is that man?

25:57.960 --> 26:00.394
- I don't know.
- Apex? A failed takeover.

26:00.560 --> 26:03.836
- What does that mean?
- Apex Group was an Asian consortium...

26:04.000 --> 26:06.719
...I used to try to take back control
of LuthorCorp from Lex.

26:06.880 --> 26:08.791
Lex found out...

26:08.960 --> 26:12.191
...and made a very compelling
argument for me to pull out.

26:12.360 --> 26:14.271
Apex funded hundreds of companies.

26:14.440 --> 26:17.034
The investors were ruined.
A lot of people lost everything.

26:17.200 --> 26:20.158
- Because of you. Because of your greed.
- No, this wasn't about me.

26:20.320 --> 26:23.118
- This was about Lex.
- Lex?

26:23.960 --> 26:25.439
About hurting him?

26:25.600 --> 26:28.353
- You hate him that much?
- I was trying to teach him, Martha.

26:28.520 --> 26:30.909
- Lessons. Hard lessons. I thought that if...
- Oh, God!

26:31.080 --> 26:33.958
If I removed the temptations
that power and money gave him...

26:34.120 --> 26:36.873
...maybe then he would be able
to rediscover his own humanity.

26:37.040 --> 26:41.113
Did you ever think of just talking to him?
Father to son?

26:44.640 --> 26:49.509
That might work in the Kent family.
But Lex is not Clark and...

26:56.680 --> 26:59.717
I'm not the father
Jonathan Kent was.

27:02.520 --> 27:05.318
It's never too late to change.

27:05.960 --> 27:08.235
<i>Unless you're dead.</i>

27:08.680 --> 27:12.832
<i>Lionel Luthor, you've destroyed</i>
<i>so many lives without consideration...</i>

27:13.000 --> 27:14.353
<i>... all to win your own games.</i>

27:15.400 --> 27:18.312
<i>Let's see if you can do the same...</i>

27:18.480 --> 27:23.156
<i>... when the life in the balance is</i>
<i>someone you so obviously care about.</i>

27:24.880 --> 27:26.472
<i>One bullet.</i>

27:26.640 --> 27:28.949
<i>Kill Senator Kent, win your freedom.</i>

27:29.920 --> 27:32.912
<i>Or if she kills you, winner goes free.</i>

27:33.080 --> 27:34.798
No.

27:36.400 --> 27:38.038
We're not playing any more games.

27:38.200 --> 27:42.273
<i>There's an explosive charge attached</i>
<i>to the elevator cable above your head.</i>

27:43.840 --> 27:45.319
<i>If one of you isn 't dead...</i>

27:46.120 --> 27:47.951
<i>... you both lose.</i>

27:50.320 --> 27:52.117
<i>Your decision.</i>

28:02.480 --> 28:03.754
Clark, how close are you?

28:03.920 --> 28:05.672
We're in the building.

28:07.400 --> 28:09.550
I think we found it. Hold on.

28:09.720 --> 28:12.996
- You wanna wait for the security team?
- No.

28:13.160 --> 28:14.832
Me neither.

28:20.800 --> 28:23.917
- Chloe, there's no one here.
- They must've rerouted the <i>signal...</i>

28:24.080 --> 28:27.197
...in case we found the camera.
- Clark.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.033
Mom.

29:00.160 --> 29:02.913
I'm sorry, Martha.

29:03.080 --> 29:04.752
Please forgive me.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.116
Only one of us
is gonna walk out of here.

29:10.280 --> 29:12.714
- Lionel...
- No, don't talk.

29:14.080 --> 29:15.479
You take it.

29:16.120 --> 29:18.270
You're good, Martha.

29:18.440 --> 29:20.670
So many people depend on you.

29:20.840 --> 29:22.239
Especially Clark.

29:22.680 --> 29:24.955
And we both know that he...

29:26.840 --> 29:29.877
What a special boy he is.

29:30.800 --> 29:33.951
And now, because Jonathan's <i>gone...</i>

29:34.120 --> 29:36.315
<i>...he's</i> gonna need you
more than ever.

29:36.480 --> 29:38.436
To become the man this...

29:38.600 --> 29:41.273
...world so desperately needs.

29:53.920 --> 29:55.478
Do it.

29:55.640 --> 29:57.392
And go home to your son.

30:05.520 --> 30:08.637
I can't. I can't.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.156
I'd hoped that...

30:13.320 --> 30:15.072
I'd <i>always...</i>

30:15.560 --> 30:19.109
...hoped that things would end
differently with us, Martha.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.190
Don't blame yourself.

30:24.760 --> 30:27.228
- Your life is truly important.
- No!

30:37.280 --> 30:39.157
Chloe? What happened?

30:39.320 --> 30:41.038
<i>The feed was terminated</i>
<i>at the source.</i>

30:41.200 --> 30:42.599
I'm trying to trace the location.

30:42.760 --> 30:45.274
The signal's all over the place,
trying to throw us off.

30:46.760 --> 30:49.638
<i>A selfless act from Lionel Luthor.</i>

30:49.800 --> 30:52.792
<i>Life is full of surprises.</i>

30:55.400 --> 30:56.674
<i>So is death.</i>

30:57.640 --> 30:58.993
- Son of a...
<i>- I got it!</i>

30:59.160 --> 31:01.071
<i>- They're somewhere across town.</i>
- Where?

31:01.240 --> 31:02.593
It's gonna take a minute
to narrow it down.

31:02.760 --> 31:04.751
Okay, start heading west.
I'll guide you in.

31:04.920 --> 31:06.831
Pull the security detail...

31:09.520 --> 31:11.238
Clark, we should...

31:17.480 --> 31:19.118
<i>There's no escaping, Lionel.</i>

31:19.280 --> 31:21.191
<i>The charges have been primed.</i>

31:21.360 --> 31:23.078
<i>One more touch of a button...</i>

31:23.240 --> 31:26.357
<i>... and the LuthorCorp empire</i>
<i>mourns its founder.</i>

31:26.520 --> 31:28.909
You were never
gonna let us go, were you?

31:29.080 --> 31:30.798
<i>You're the master manipulator, Lionel.</i>

31:30.960 --> 31:33.030
<i>You should know</i>
<i>that some games are rigged.</i>

31:34.920 --> 31:36.273
Why didn't you just kill me?

31:36.440 --> 31:40.194
<i>Because I wanted</i>
<i>to watch you suffer like I did.</i>

31:45.240 --> 31:46.593
You. You're the... The...

31:46.760 --> 31:50.514
Yeah, I stood right in front of you today.
You didn't even know who I was.

31:51.280 --> 31:53.714
You didn't see the house I lost.

31:54.160 --> 31:56.628
Wife. Children.

31:56.800 --> 32:00.509
An entire life gone
because of your little game with Apex.

32:01.640 --> 32:03.358
I'm no one.

32:03.680 --> 32:06.672
Just another piece of Lionel Luthor's
collateral damage.

32:06.840 --> 32:10.037
This is between me...

32:10.200 --> 32:11.838
...and you.

32:12.240 --> 32:13.514
Let her go.

32:20.360 --> 32:22.191
Does it hurt, Lionel?

32:22.360 --> 32:24.032
Knowing you're gonna watch her die?

32:25.160 --> 32:28.311
The one person you would have
sacrificed your life for.

32:29.080 --> 32:30.752
Let her go.

32:31.720 --> 32:33.358
This is my fault.

32:33.960 --> 32:35.598
All of it.

32:49.040 --> 32:51.235
I'm sorry.

32:58.680 --> 33:01.240
That's all I wanted to hear.

34:03.080 --> 34:05.878
That was...

34:07.680 --> 34:09.511
...miraculous.

34:16.520 --> 34:18.033
Thank you...

34:18.560 --> 34:19.879
...son.

34:40.719 --> 34:43.473
- Oh, sweetie, thank you.
- Yeah.

34:45.600 --> 34:47.476
You're sure you're okay?

34:48.120 --> 34:50.998
I got some bumps and bruises,
but l... I'll live.

34:51.760 --> 34:53.079
No thanks to Lionel.

34:54.040 --> 34:55.553
What happened...

34:55.719 --> 34:59.759
...was the work of a very disturbed man.
Lionel's no <i>saint...</i>

34:59.920 --> 35:01.433
<i>...but</i> this wasn't his fault.

35:03.040 --> 35:04.473
Maybe not directly.

35:05.240 --> 35:07.276
He was willing to sacrifice himself.

35:07.840 --> 35:10.308
For your future.

35:14.840 --> 35:18.389
Lionel never does anything
that doesn't benefit him in the end.

35:19.160 --> 35:20.639
We can't trust him.

35:23.080 --> 35:26.789
If we wanna protect your secret,
we might not have a choice.

35:40.200 --> 35:41.997
Lincoln Kole.

35:42.440 --> 35:44.510
That was the name
of the man who did all this.

35:50.920 --> 35:54.595
- You found him?
- In a bar around the block.

35:54.960 --> 35:58.999
He was toasting your demise.

35:59.640 --> 36:02.598
Didn't care if he was caught,
as long as you were dead.

36:03.280 --> 36:07.592
The authorities had to sedate him
when he found out you weren't.

36:10.600 --> 36:15.116
Powerful men, son.
We attract the occasional lunatic.

36:15.680 --> 36:19.514
It wasn't insanity that drove him
to that, Dad. It was you.

36:22.160 --> 36:24.037
We all make mistakes, son.

36:24.200 --> 36:27.192
And yours almost cost
Martha Kent her life.

36:29.600 --> 36:30.953
Well, I'm just <i>thankful...</i>

36:31.120 --> 36:34.476
<i>...the</i> elevator's safety brakes slowed us
down enough to survive the fall.

36:34.640 --> 36:36.119
Yeah.

36:36.520 --> 36:38.033
You should be.

36:38.200 --> 36:40.156
Especially since Kole disabled them.

36:41.960 --> 36:44.428
That's enough to make
a man believe in miracles.

36:44.600 --> 36:47.353
Isn't it, son?

36:51.160 --> 36:56.553
I don't suppose clark had anything to do
with that divine intervention.

36:58.600 --> 37:00.158
Clark?

37:02.320 --> 37:04.914
I heard what you said over the video.

37:06.160 --> 37:08.230
About what a special boy he is.

37:11.480 --> 37:12.879
What'd you mean by that?

37:14.240 --> 37:16.470
I meant that...

37:18.680 --> 37:21.956
<i>...he's</i> the kind of son
a father could be proud of.

37:31.000 --> 37:34.629
One minute he's standing
in the same room with me...

37:36.440 --> 37:39.113
<i>...and</i> the next he's across town.

37:40.640 --> 37:44.030
You're still obsessing over him
after all these years?

37:44.200 --> 37:46.111
Clark Kent's a simple farm boy.

37:46.280 --> 37:47.633
Let it go, Lex.

37:50.520 --> 37:52.272
Let it go.

38:13.800 --> 38:17.270
I've been expecting you, Kal-EI.

38:18.160 --> 38:19.479
How long have you known?

38:19.640 --> 38:21.870
From the moment I held
in my hand the crystal...

38:22.040 --> 38:24.634
...that helped to form
your Fortress of Solitude.

38:25.240 --> 38:26.798
The one that put you in a coma?

38:27.320 --> 38:28.958
Coma?

38:29.520 --> 38:31.988
I'd like to think of it as a...

38:33.200 --> 38:35.634
A state of...

38:36.280 --> 38:39.272
...contemplative repose.

38:39.840 --> 38:41.671
You've known my secret
for almost a year.

38:41.840 --> 38:42.909
Yes.

38:43.080 --> 38:44.513
Why haven't you done anything?

38:44.680 --> 38:48.753
What? Expose you to the world,
some strange visitor from another planet?

38:48.920 --> 38:51.878
I've tried to tell you,
I am not your enemy.

38:52.040 --> 38:53.314
To reveal your secret...

38:53.480 --> 38:56.153
...would change your destiny.

38:58.800 --> 39:02.429
And it would harm someone
I care about very deeply.

39:03.960 --> 39:05.712
You had a choice...

39:06.440 --> 39:08.556
...to kill my mother or to kill yourself.

39:08.720 --> 39:11.314
I could never harm your mother.
There was no choice.

39:11.480 --> 39:12.913
Yeah?

39:13.440 --> 39:15.237
Unless you knew the gun
wasn't loaded.

39:18.320 --> 39:20.356
You have no reason
to believe anything I say.

39:20.520 --> 39:21.794
I realize that.

39:21.960 --> 39:24.952
But I hope eventually,
you will come to trust me.

39:26.600 --> 39:29.319
I only want what's best
for you and your mother...

39:29.480 --> 39:31.277
...son.

39:33.560 --> 39:35.710
You don't call me that.

39:37.200 --> 39:39.111
Jonathan Kent was my father.

39:39.600 --> 39:44.116
- No, I'm not trying to take his place.
- You couldn't.

39:48.320 --> 39:51.437
My mother seems to think
there may be some good in you.

39:52.400 --> 39:54.391
But I'm not so sure.

39:54.560 --> 39:57.836
It takes time, Clark.
Maybe you will be.

39:58.880 --> 40:01.235
Or maybe you'll just
show your true colors.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.275
Secret or no secret...

40:05.840 --> 40:08.832
...you stay away from my mother.

40:09.760 --> 40:12.593
Or you'll wish I never saved your life.
