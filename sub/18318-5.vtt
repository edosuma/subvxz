00:34.135 --> 00:36.937
Great. Terrific.
Very profound.

00:50.484 --> 00:53.287
- Hello. Hi. Hi.
- Si.

00:53.287 --> 00:55.989
Um, so Alessandra
would love to thank you,

00:55.989 --> 00:58.459
but, um,
she's on vocal rest
for the concert tonight,

00:58.459 --> 01:00.128
so I'm gonna
say it for her.

01:00.128 --> 01:02.530
Grazie mille.
Bye-bye.

01:02.530 --> 01:04.932
- Signorina.
- Yeah?

01:04.932 --> 01:06.734
- Scuze.
- Uh-huh?

01:06.734 --> 01:09.036
The diva, she promise
for tonight--

01:09.036 --> 01:10.138
Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah. Okay.

01:10.138 --> 01:11.472
Here you go,
your Beatitude,

01:11.472 --> 01:13.574
four VIP tickets, but
remember to get there early

01:13.574 --> 01:16.144
- because it's gonna be
a... shit show.

01:16.144 --> 01:18.146
Oh, my God.

01:19.180 --> 01:22.416
Excuse me!

01:22.416 --> 01:25.219
Oh, my-- Okay.
Thank you.

01:28.656 --> 01:32.760
This is a ham that
someone gave to me
to give to you.

01:32.760 --> 01:35.729
It's a very special ham
from Donatella Versace.

01:35.729 --> 01:38.166
It's the only kind
that she eats when
she eats--

01:41.169 --> 01:42.670
Just here--

01:42.670 --> 01:44.605
In case you're hungry.

01:44.605 --> 01:48.842
Can I maybe just,
like, run through
a costume change?

01:51.712 --> 01:53.881
Are you okay?

01:53.881 --> 01:56.684
- I was talking.
- Oh.

01:56.684 --> 01:57.718
To who?

01:57.718 --> 01:59.287
To Maria Callas.

01:59.287 --> 02:03.391
Ah. Did she say
anything good?

02:03.391 --> 02:05.092
Wish you luck
or anything?

02:05.092 --> 02:07.595
She said I was a fool.

02:07.595 --> 02:08.996
- Hailey.
- Yeah.

02:08.996 --> 02:11.865
I want you to go to Rodrigo
and ask him a question.

02:11.865 --> 02:15.068
I think I will get
a more honest answer
if you ask.

02:15.068 --> 02:17.471
Well, if it's about
the modern piece,

02:17.471 --> 02:20.341
I have to say
it is sounding--

02:21.875 --> 02:25.413
So, look. If you can
stay open to the cameras
as much as possible,

02:25.413 --> 02:26.814
that would be great.

02:26.814 --> 02:29.217
We have the three remotes
here on the rafts,

02:29.217 --> 02:30.684
then the camera boats.

02:30.684 --> 02:32.720
I mean, not if it
messes with your conducting.

02:32.720 --> 02:35.656
- What is your name again?
- Kyle.

02:35.656 --> 02:38.726
Kylie. Kylie,
can you leave, please?

02:38.726 --> 02:40.961
Of course.

02:40.961 --> 02:42.630
- Thank you.
- Just remember,

02:42.630 --> 02:44.765
you need 15 minutes
to get to the piazza,

02:44.765 --> 02:46.300
so if you need
a pee break or--

02:46.300 --> 02:47.768
I don't need a pee break,
Union Bob.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.937
Bob? Who's Bob?
My name is Kyle.

02:49.937 --> 02:51.239
Kylie.

02:52.973 --> 02:54.342
- Hi.
- Hey, Hai Lai.

02:54.342 --> 02:56.076
Yeah, I'm so happy
to see you.

02:56.076 --> 02:58.111
So what-- what--
what's going on?

02:58.111 --> 03:00.548
She's a little tense,
she's, uh, talking to Callas.

03:00.548 --> 03:02.916
She's so in--
Oh, she's talking to Ca--
Oh, good.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.652
- Yeah, it's good.
- Good, good, good.

03:04.652 --> 03:07.255
Um, I have to ask you
a question from her.

03:07.255 --> 03:08.889
Okay.

03:09.723 --> 03:11.425
- Maestro.
- Oh, Beppi.

03:11.425 --> 03:14.495
I've come to wish you
merda, tanta merda.

03:14.495 --> 03:16.497
Grazie, grazie

03:16.497 --> 03:18.966
And to ask you
whether you might
consider to

03:18.966 --> 03:23.036
wear this camera
during the performance.
It's a tiny, tiny camera.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.472
- Camera.
- Yes.

03:24.472 --> 03:26.274
It will give the
world-wide audience

03:26.274 --> 03:27.841
a conductor's eye view.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.009
Mm, no, no, no.

03:29.009 --> 03:30.411
I try.

03:30.411 --> 03:31.979
And how is she?
She's preparing?

03:31.979 --> 03:35.048
She sings--
in her imagination.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.017
Yeah, she's singing
in her imagination.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.819
Maybe you should go
wish her tanta merda.

03:38.819 --> 03:41.289
Wish her luck?
She will kill me.

03:41.289 --> 03:44.692
Well, here we are.
The super team.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.062
Ciao.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.764
- Okay. So--
- Okay, so...

03:50.764 --> 03:53.834
she wants to know if
you're in love with her?

03:53.834 --> 03:55.569
- If I'm in love with her?
- Yeah.

03:59.307 --> 04:01.709
If I'm in love with her?

04:04.878 --> 04:10.418
Why? Why, why--
If I'm in love with her?

04:10.418 --> 04:13.153
Why--
Why would you ask--

04:13.153 --> 04:15.656
Why do you ask me
that question?

04:15.656 --> 04:17.791
You, you of all people,
why do you ask me that?

04:17.791 --> 04:19.427
What do you mean,
me of all people?

04:19.427 --> 04:21.329
I need a mate.
Okay? I need a mate.

04:21.329 --> 04:22.830
Okay, I think it's
a very simple question.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.898
Are you in love with her
or aren't you in love with her?

04:24.898 --> 04:27.200
Well, Hai Lai, you know,
I mean it's a--

04:27.200 --> 04:30.404
Okay, I'm-- I'm in love
with her.

04:30.404 --> 04:32.673
Mm. With her musicianship.

04:32.673 --> 04:35.142
I love her voice, you know?
I've always loved her voice.

04:35.142 --> 04:37.645
- Mm-hm.
- I'm in love
with her craft.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.547
I'm in love with
how she looks,

04:39.547 --> 04:41.382
because she's very--
you know.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.651
I-- I'm in love with, uh--
with her music--

04:43.651 --> 04:45.853
Okay, did you say that
you were in love with her?

04:45.853 --> 04:48.356
She said that you said that
you were in love with her.

04:48.356 --> 04:50.023
I think-- Mm.

04:50.023 --> 04:51.492
I might have
said something

04:51.492 --> 04:54.895
that actually
sort of means that.
Yeah.

04:57.365 --> 05:00.534
I told her that
I love her, but--

05:00.534 --> 05:02.102
Yeah.
Several times.

05:02.102 --> 05:03.671
Okay.
Were you lying?

05:03.671 --> 05:05.005
No, I wasn't lying.
Of course not.

05:05.005 --> 05:07.541
I never lie when
I say those things.
I mean,

05:07.541 --> 05:09.377
in the moment, I mean it.

05:09.377 --> 05:10.444
And then there's
another moment.

05:10.444 --> 05:12.045
- Yeah.
- Okay? And then--

05:12.045 --> 05:14.081
And then I'm-- I'm just
a whirl of contradictions,
Hai Lai.

05:14.081 --> 05:16.384
- That's not good enough.
- What? Not good enough
for you?

05:16.384 --> 05:18.118
No, it's not good enough
for you.

05:18.118 --> 05:20.053
You can't just tell someone
that you love them,
and then backtrack.

05:20.053 --> 05:22.523
You can't just tell someone
that they play with the blood,

05:22.523 --> 05:24.257
and that they're gonna be
a great conductor,

05:24.257 --> 05:26.394
and then just throw them
in a shark tank
way before they're ready--

05:26.394 --> 05:27.795
- Hey.
- And beyond that,

05:27.795 --> 05:29.463
you can't tell the orchestra
that they're your family,

05:29.463 --> 05:31.031
and then just
fucking leave them.

05:31.031 --> 05:32.966
Hai Lai.

05:33.867 --> 05:34.968
Hai Lai.

05:38.238 --> 05:39.840
Oh, chica.

05:43.811 --> 05:45.546
I'm sorry.

06:10.170 --> 06:11.605
Oh, fuck.

06:14.508 --> 06:16.644
Ay-- Ay, ay.

06:19.279 --> 06:22.550
Hey.

06:22.550 --> 06:25.118
Alessandra.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.121
Do not come near me.

06:34.728 --> 06:38.466
Now I will sing.

06:42.636 --> 06:44.705
You still want me to be
your dresser, right?

06:50.243 --> 06:53.814
Cynthia, please let us
chip in on the simulcast.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.983
It's okay,
it's only $3.99.

06:55.983 --> 06:57.651
It's gonna be weird
watching him conduct,

06:57.651 --> 06:59.286
and not holding my violin.

06:59.286 --> 07:01.388
You can hold my cello if
that'll make you feel better.

07:01.388 --> 07:03.156
Yeah,
it might, it might.

07:03.156 --> 07:04.558
Welcome.
Hey, everyone,

07:04.558 --> 07:06.226
this is Lizzie.
Remember Lizzie?

07:06.226 --> 07:07.895
- Hailey's friend
and my friend.
- Oh, hey.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.362
- Nice get up.
- Thank you.

07:09.362 --> 07:11.264
I'm mildly obsessed with a
turn of the century composer.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.866
This is how
she dresses.

07:12.866 --> 07:16.236
I used to
dress up as Lord Byron
and smoke opium in college.

07:16.236 --> 07:17.738
- No shit.
- Yeah.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.573
Yeah, I was you before
you were you, Dee Dee.

07:19.573 --> 07:22.510
What is it?

07:23.343 --> 07:25.345
I don't want to resign.

07:25.345 --> 07:27.748
Well, then don't.

07:27.748 --> 07:31.418
Why let that bugger
determine your future?

07:31.418 --> 07:34.187
He's just a lucky
fucking bastard.

07:46.433 --> 07:48.902
Now, this is exciting.

07:48.902 --> 07:51.672
Who would have thought we'd
run into each other here,

07:51.672 --> 07:53.173
- huh, Maestro?
- Yeah.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.208
And I've always been
such a big fan.

07:55.208 --> 07:59.379
You may not remember this,
but we met once 15 years ago

07:59.379 --> 08:00.948
in Helsinki
at the airport.

08:00.948 --> 08:03.817
I was having a shrimp
sandwich in the lounge.

08:03.817 --> 08:08.088
They make fantastic
shrimp sandwiches there
in Helsinki.

08:08.088 --> 08:10.891
And you were on your way
to Vilnius, Lithuania,

08:10.891 --> 08:15.095
and I complimented you
on your blue Balenciaga shoes,

08:15.095 --> 08:18.265
and here you are
dressed in blue again.

08:18.265 --> 08:20.233
Winnie, Winnie.

08:20.233 --> 08:23.270
Hey, nice ax,
by the way.

08:23.270 --> 08:25.238
Thank you.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.473
What, has she
gone mute?

09:33.473 --> 09:35.743
- Somebody should give her
a kick up the ass.
- Shh.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.685
She's missed
the entrance.
- Twice.

09:44.685 --> 09:46.186
I can't take this.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.933
Ah, thank God.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.524
- Yes, Bob?
- What?

10:24.524 --> 10:26.193
You're staring at me.

10:26.193 --> 10:28.762
Sorry. Schubert has
a weird effect on me.

11:02.462 --> 11:05.365
Bugger me,
it's Placido.

11:05.365 --> 11:06.934
It's Placido.

12:06.794 --> 12:09.629
- Man, I wish I was there.
- We all do.

12:09.629 --> 12:10.663
I wish Rodrigo was here.

12:10.663 --> 12:12.265
The heck with him.

12:12.265 --> 12:13.967
If he'd rather be
over there in Venice

12:13.967 --> 12:16.236
conducting one of the most
beautiful women in the world

12:16.236 --> 12:18.671
instead of on
the picket lines
here with us,

12:18.671 --> 12:19.840
that's his loss.

13:48.395 --> 13:49.930
Bravo! Bravo!
Bravo!

13:49.930 --> 13:52.132
Bravo! Bravo!

14:02.910 --> 14:04.744
Alessandra,
are you cold?

14:04.744 --> 14:07.014
Not in your arms,
Placido.

14:07.014 --> 14:10.250
Perhaps in some other
bastard's embrace.

14:13.753 --> 14:17.224
Okay, so, we have 10 minutes
to get to Piazza San Marco

14:17.224 --> 14:18.291
and I have your tasty wig.

14:18.291 --> 14:19.759
Can I take anything
from you?

14:19.759 --> 14:21.328
- Take this.
- Okay. Ow! Mother--

14:21.328 --> 14:23.296
- Accident.
- Marvelous. Transcendent

14:23.296 --> 14:26.466
- There are 30 million
watching in Beijing

14:26.466 --> 14:28.035
- It's gonna be okay.
- 30 millions.

14:28.035 --> 14:30.470
- Maestro.
- Rodrigo.

14:39.679 --> 14:41.548
Shh.

14:43.283 --> 14:46.353
You tell me and
I might have to kill you.

14:46.353 --> 14:47.988
No, no, no, no,
please, no, no, no.

14:47.988 --> 14:49.489
Bueno, bueno.

15:11.178 --> 15:14.247
- Rodrigo.
- Sì?

15:20.253 --> 15:22.589
- Maestro Rivera?
- Sì.

17:28.615 --> 17:31.284
I've wanted to do that
for a long time.

17:43.130 --> 17:44.431
She cut his hair off.

17:44.431 --> 17:45.865
That shit was hardcore.

17:49.502 --> 17:50.737
Thank you for
the haircut.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.605
It's just the beginning.

17:52.605 --> 17:54.874
Hmm.

17:54.874 --> 17:56.643
Hm. Ah.

18:00.813 --> 18:03.883
So that's a real knife.

18:03.883 --> 18:06.286
It's from my kitchen.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.188
Yeah, it looks
really sharp.

18:08.188 --> 18:09.822
- Wig.
- Yes.

18:11.791 --> 18:14.494
When did this wig happen?

18:14.494 --> 18:17.063
Tie this.

18:17.063 --> 18:19.466
It's gonna look
really nice.

18:19.466 --> 18:22.469
Hey, I just wanted to say,
um, that thing earlier--

18:22.469 --> 18:23.770
the me and Rodrigo thing--

18:23.770 --> 18:25.605
it's really just not
that big of a deal.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.207
It's just something
that happens sometimes,

18:27.207 --> 18:28.908
and not even that often
sometimes,

18:28.908 --> 18:31.178
so you have nothing
to worry about whatsoever.

18:31.178 --> 18:32.945
- Box.
- What?

18:32.945 --> 18:34.614
Hand me that box.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.816
Yes.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.385
Right away.

18:40.887 --> 18:42.755
It's a prop gun, right?

18:44.023 --> 18:46.359
Right?

18:46.359 --> 18:50.297
Take off this.
Yes.

19:04.211 --> 19:05.545
Where the hell's
the orchestra?

19:05.545 --> 19:08.215
I think it's done
electronically.

19:28.635 --> 19:31.971
- Where'd the orchestra go?
- They got locked out.

19:48.255 --> 19:50.657
Boo!

19:50.657 --> 19:51.691
Boo!

19:51.691 --> 19:52.525
Boo!

19:58.731 --> 20:01.000
Shh! Philistine.

21:32.091 --> 21:33.793
That is daft.

21:38.831 --> 21:39.866
No!

21:39.866 --> 21:40.733
Is that Hailey?

22:19.105 --> 22:21.173
Alessandra!

22:25.478 --> 22:27.547
Stupenda, Alessandra!

22:27.547 --> 22:29.449
I'm getting--
Oh, Christ.

22:39.792 --> 22:40.893
Wow!

22:43.563 --> 22:45.732
Ole, Alessandra.

22:45.732 --> 22:46.699
Wow!

23:02.114 --> 23:03.983
- Ah, Maestro!
Brilliant.
- Yes.

23:03.983 --> 23:06.619
Fabulous!
I have offers from
across Europe--

23:06.619 --> 23:10.457
- Thank you, Winnie.
Thank you for being here.
- As well as Japan and Dubai,

23:10.457 --> 23:12.992
and Montego Bay.

23:12.992 --> 23:15.595
Only you, only you could
bring this out of her.

23:15.595 --> 23:17.530
Only you!

23:17.530 --> 23:21.468
- Lizzie?
- Hailes. What the fuck
were you doing out there?

23:21.468 --> 23:22.935
Oh, my God, that's
a really good question.

23:22.935 --> 23:24.236
Oh, there's some people
that want to say hi to you.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.472
Hey, world traveler.

23:25.472 --> 23:27.073
Don't forget about
the little people.

23:27.073 --> 23:30.276
- How's the Walsh Ensemble?
- Good, I got fired.

23:30.276 --> 23:32.311
You what?
That's not good.

23:32.311 --> 23:34.714
When are you coming home?
We miss you.

23:34.714 --> 23:36.849
I'm coming back as soon
as fucking possible.

23:36.849 --> 23:40.019
- Hey, Maestro. Hey.
- Oh, well done, my lad,
well done.

23:40.019 --> 23:42.722
Brilliant. So brilliant,
but just, uh--

23:42.722 --> 23:45.357
The-- I don't know,
knife,

23:45.357 --> 23:47.293
just a tad, a tad,
you know--

23:47.293 --> 23:49.028
- Mm.
- You know what
I'm talking about.

23:49.028 --> 23:51.498
Rodrigo,
we just heard about
Maestro Rivera.

23:51.498 --> 23:52.599
I am so sorry.

23:52.599 --> 23:54.501
- I'm a wanker.
- Oh, no, no.

23:54.501 --> 23:56.202
Yes. Yes,
you were right.

23:56.202 --> 23:59.371
- I am a-- I'm a wanker.
- We're all wankers, Maestro.

23:59.371 --> 24:01.040
- I must say hello
to Alessandra.
- All of us.

24:01.040 --> 24:04.511
- All wankers.
- No. No, he's a wanker.

24:06.178 --> 24:09.582
Scuse. Scuse, scuse.
Scuse.

24:11.350 --> 24:13.520
Grazie. Grazie.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.187
Alessandra.

24:17.423 --> 24:19.626
Alessandra.

24:19.626 --> 24:22.261
I'm back.
I'm La Fiamma again.

24:22.261 --> 24:23.930
I'm going to destroy you.

24:23.930 --> 24:25.565
I will never
work with you again.

24:25.565 --> 24:27.700
If I meet you again,
I'll kill you for real,

24:27.700 --> 24:29.201
you bastard.

25:08.675 --> 25:11.711
My papa died
in Salzburg.

25:11.711 --> 25:13.746
I wasn't there.

25:13.746 --> 25:17.650
He didn't want me
to leave Salzburg.

25:17.650 --> 25:18.985
He missed me.

25:21.287 --> 25:25.391
But I had a family.

25:25.391 --> 25:26.893
I had a wife.

25:30.296 --> 25:32.064
What do you have?
