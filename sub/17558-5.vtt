WEBVTT

00:02.036 --> 00:04.004
Now you're looking like a real
pro surfer there, Shania.

00:04.038 --> 00:06.240
Catching waves and keeping
your glasses on.

00:06.274 --> 00:07.508
It was awesome.

00:07.541 --> 00:09.810
I'm gonna go cross
"wipe out on a surfboard"

00:09.843 --> 00:12.012
off my California Dreams
bucket list.

00:13.381 --> 00:14.382
Thanks for doing this, guys.

00:14.415 --> 00:15.516
Especially you, Bryan.

00:15.549 --> 00:18.186
I know that dog
with the bandana frightened you.

00:18.219 --> 00:20.588
His owner was wearing cut-off
jeans as a bathing suit.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.990
But it was nice
to see Shania happy.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.525
Yeah, it's been
tough lately.

00:24.558 --> 00:25.859
She's been scared we'll
have to move back to Ohio

00:25.893 --> 00:27.328
if I lose this custody thing.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.829
Oh.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.431
Although, technically, I did
kidnap her, cross state lines

00:30.464 --> 00:32.366
and get knocked up
by a couple of gay guys.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.767
Oh God, I'm so gonna lose.

00:33.801 --> 00:34.868
No, you are not.

00:34.902 --> 00:36.204
David and I are
talking to some really

00:36.237 --> 00:37.371
great family
law attorneys.

00:37.405 --> 00:38.706
You know what, stay,

00:38.739 --> 00:39.873
and we'll make dinner
and we'll talk strategy.

00:39.907 --> 00:41.409
No, Bry, we can't.

00:41.442 --> 00:42.543
Remember, my mom's
coming to town tonight?

00:42.576 --> 00:43.877
Oh, that's right.

00:43.911 --> 00:44.878
I was pretending
I forgot about that.

00:44.912 --> 00:46.447
Now, you've ruined it.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.349
You don't get along
with your mother-in-law?

00:48.382 --> 00:49.750
I don't get along
with mine either.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.885
Besides the shallow clavicles,
that's the first thing
we have in common.

00:51.919 --> 00:53.887
I thought not getting along
with a mother-in-law was
just a straight thing,

00:53.921 --> 00:56.224
you know, like going
fly-fishing or playing Frisbee.

00:56.257 --> 00:58.526
Turns out,
it's a universal nightmare.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.361
(video game playing)
Bop, bop, bop.

01:00.394 --> 01:01.729
Oh, Clay,
what are you doing?

01:01.762 --> 01:04.632
Get dressed, your mom's
coming over tonight.

01:04.665 --> 01:05.899
I've got to clean and then...

01:06.934 --> 01:08.136
(coos)

01:08.169 --> 01:09.403
Wow,

01:09.437 --> 01:11.505
you already did it.
Thank you.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.875
Oh, hey, Goldie.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.043
Clay's never been real good
with his aim.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.211
No need to thank me.

01:17.245 --> 01:18.879
I know housework
isn't important to you.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.081
(video game explosion)

01:21.115 --> 01:24.084
Well, horror stories aside,
Bryan is exaggerating.

01:24.118 --> 01:26.220
My mother is amazing.

01:26.254 --> 01:28.156
You should come with us
tonight, you'll see.

01:28.189 --> 01:29.390
I'd love to
meet your mom.
That's great.

01:29.423 --> 01:30.424
We were gonna tell her
about the baby anyway,

01:30.458 --> 01:31.492
so it's perfect
you'll be there.

01:31.525 --> 01:32.893
I'm so excited.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.662
I'm excited, too.
I'm gonna go upstairs and change

01:34.695 --> 01:37.331
and eat a pill
the size of a cake.

01:56.217 --> 01:57.285
Another Chardonnay
for you, Jane?

01:57.318 --> 01:58.952
Nope, two drink rule.

01:58.986 --> 02:00.854
A lady never stumbles home,

02:00.888 --> 02:03.857
even if home is just
a crappy elevator ride away.

02:03.891 --> 02:06.460
Bet you can't wait to get out
of here and go back to Ohio.

02:06.494 --> 02:08.095
Ugh, God, Billie,
you have no idea.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.130
That custody hearing
cannot come soon enough.

02:10.164 --> 02:12.099
My granddaughter
may be hypnotized

02:12.132 --> 02:13.601
by those gay pied pipers,

02:13.634 --> 02:15.869
but I know what is best for her,

02:15.903 --> 02:16.970
for her daughter,

02:17.004 --> 02:18.972
for all of us, is to move home.

02:19.006 --> 02:20.941
Then maybe I should
buy you a drink

02:20.974 --> 02:22.142
while I still have the chance.

02:22.176 --> 02:23.377
(scoffs)

02:23.411 --> 02:24.812
I don't really
need your charity.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.780
I just liquidated my 401K.

02:26.814 --> 02:29.450
What I don't piss away
on hotel bills,

02:29.483 --> 02:33.120
I plan to invest
in dolphin traps or coal.

02:33.153 --> 02:36.156
Altruistic.
I like that.

02:36.190 --> 02:37.258
Very sexy.

02:39.527 --> 02:42.396
I'm sorry,
w-w-what's your agenda here?

02:42.430 --> 02:44.832
Oh, just to buy
a beautiful woman a drink.

02:44.865 --> 02:47.701
Supposed to give this
big sales presentation

02:47.735 --> 02:48.969
tomorrow morning
and I'm being bad.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.505
I thought maybe we could
be bad together?

02:55.543 --> 02:58.679
That depends on, uh,
w-what you're selling.

02:58.712 --> 03:01.249
Oh, I sell vitamins.

03:01.282 --> 03:04.852
Oh, I thought you were going
to say, uh, "charm."

03:05.886 --> 03:08.489
I was going for, uh, flirty?

03:08.522 --> 03:10.023
Yeah, I know.

03:10.057 --> 03:11.559
It's been awhile
since I've done this.

03:11.592 --> 03:12.760
Oh, well,

03:12.793 --> 03:14.027
you're doing great.

03:14.061 --> 03:15.963
Just takes a little practice.

03:18.566 --> 03:19.700
Okay.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.369
One drink.

03:21.402 --> 03:22.536
Watch your mouth
and mind your paws.

03:22.570 --> 03:25.205
Okay.

03:26.240 --> 03:30.043
My boy, my beautiful boy.

03:30.077 --> 03:31.178
Look at you, so gorgeous.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.547
I can't believe
you came out of me.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.716
Oh, Mom,
so glad you're here.

03:35.749 --> 03:38.051
Bryan, good to see you.

03:38.085 --> 03:39.620
And that jacket.

03:39.653 --> 03:41.389
My goodness, they can see you
from outer space.

03:41.422 --> 03:43.424
(nervous laugh)
Hi, Frances.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.294
There you are.

03:46.327 --> 03:48.061
Sorry, I had to pee.

03:48.095 --> 03:49.863
They have really
nice bathrooms here.

03:49.897 --> 03:52.400
And who is this adorable blonde,
with the button nose

03:52.433 --> 03:54.468
and the big goyish eyes?
They're actually more greenish.

03:54.502 --> 03:56.036
BRYAN:
Frances, this is Goldie.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.739
She's a new and very
special friend of ours.

03:58.772 --> 04:00.408
Mom, this is actually why we
wanted you to come and visit.

04:00.441 --> 04:01.475
To tell you in person.

04:01.509 --> 04:03.076
Goldie isn't
just a friend.

04:03.110 --> 04:04.645
She's also our surrogate.

04:04.678 --> 04:06.079
I don't understand.

04:06.113 --> 04:07.548
Bryan and I
are having a baby.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.083
Oh, my God.

04:10.117 --> 04:13.387
Oh, David, David, David.

04:13.421 --> 04:15.889
I have dreamed of this day
for so long.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.257
And you.

04:17.291 --> 04:19.893
Welcome to the family.

04:19.927 --> 04:23.230
Uh, you're gonna have
to start calling me "Mom."

04:23.263 --> 04:25.265
Actually, M-Mom,

04:25.299 --> 04:27.100
uh, this all happened
because of Bryan.

04:27.134 --> 04:28.268
Ah, Goldie,

04:28.302 --> 04:29.437
I can see it now,
in your cheeks.

04:29.470 --> 04:30.738
You're just glowing.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.240
So, whose sperm did you use?

04:33.273 --> 04:34.775
Oh, come on, Mom,
that doesn't matter.

04:34.808 --> 04:37.177
What, we're all adults.
I watch Bravo. Whose sperm?

04:37.210 --> 04:38.612
It's David's sperm.
It's not
important.

04:38.646 --> 04:40.948
The sperm came
from The Blessed One himself.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.850
Bryan felt, and this
is so sweet of him,

04:42.883 --> 04:44.585
that because he comes
from a big family

04:44.618 --> 04:45.586
and I'm an only child...

04:45.619 --> 04:47.355
So, it's yours.

04:47.388 --> 04:48.689
Ah, thank God.

04:48.722 --> 04:51.124
My real grandchild.

04:51.158 --> 04:52.626
Barbara Rozanski
is going to plotz.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.294
Her daughter's uterus
looks like a bramble patch.

04:54.328 --> 04:56.129
But you,

04:56.163 --> 05:00.267
you have made me
the happiest grandmommy

05:00.300 --> 05:02.302
on all of the Earth.

05:02.336 --> 05:06.474
I'm going to be needing
dessert for dinner, thank you.

05:06.507 --> 05:08.108
Well, so, what about you?

05:08.141 --> 05:09.276
What brings you to LA?

05:09.309 --> 05:11.011
Oh, same as the rest.

05:11.044 --> 05:13.481
Just a dumb whore looking
to get on a reality show.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.349
(laughing)
Aw.

05:15.383 --> 05:16.517
Let me get you another drink.

05:16.550 --> 05:17.718
No way.

05:17.751 --> 05:19.887
I'm already past
my good judgment limit.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.322
Aw, perfect, can't wait to find
out what that looks like.

05:22.356 --> 05:23.457
Nah, no, hey.

05:23.491 --> 05:25.225
The way that I was raised,
a man always gets the tab.

05:25.258 --> 05:27.495
So, if you're
gonna buy the drinks,

05:27.528 --> 05:29.463
I've gotta figure out a way
to pay you back.

05:29.497 --> 05:31.399
Oh, my God.

05:31.432 --> 05:32.966
Stop that.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.669
Your mother should've
spanked you more.

05:35.703 --> 05:37.371
Ooh, yeah, I'm open to that.

05:43.544 --> 05:44.845
DAVID:
Good news.

05:44.878 --> 05:47.314
Mom loves the new comforter
in the guesthouse.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.482
Wonderful.

05:48.516 --> 05:50.050
FYI, I will not be
speaking to your mother

05:50.083 --> 05:52.520
for the rest
of her visit.
Here we go.

05:52.553 --> 05:53.687
She's excited about your baby.

05:53.721 --> 05:55.355
It's our baby, David.

05:55.389 --> 05:57.157
Do you have any clue
how much that hurt my feelings?

05:57.190 --> 05:59.326
I am confident you will tell me.

05:59.359 --> 06:02.195
I'm so sick of your mother
spitting in my face and you

06:02.229 --> 06:03.697
trying to convince me
it's just a little rain.

06:03.731 --> 06:05.699
Come on, Bry, it was a reflex

06:05.733 --> 06:07.535
emotional response to learning
she's going to be a grandma.

06:07.568 --> 06:08.669
There.

06:08.702 --> 06:09.870
That right there.

06:09.903 --> 06:12.372
You are explaining away
her behavior again.

06:12.406 --> 06:14.708
Siri, text Rocky to come
stab me in the ears.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.777
She's my mom, Bryan.

06:16.810 --> 06:18.211
Yeah, well, I'm your baby's mom.

06:18.245 --> 06:20.213
Kind of.

06:20.247 --> 06:23.551
It's just you're so blind
to how awful she treats me.

06:23.584 --> 06:26.454
It's like her only mission
in life is to try to outdo me.

06:30.090 --> 06:31.391
Christmas dinner is served.

06:31.425 --> 06:33.126
Oh.

06:33.160 --> 06:35.395
You're welcome.

06:35.429 --> 06:38.432
And I made David's
favorite dessert,

06:38.466 --> 06:39.533
crêpe suzette.

06:39.567 --> 06:42.836
(cheering, laughter)

06:45.673 --> 06:46.707
Right?

06:46.740 --> 06:47.708
Huh?

06:47.741 --> 06:48.876
Bon appétit.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.578
My mom is a four-star chef,

06:50.611 --> 06:52.145
and I didn't want
to hurt her feelings.

06:52.179 --> 06:55.115
Plus, there was fire,
and fire is cool.

06:55.148 --> 06:56.750
Look, you guys have got to stop
putting me in the middle.

06:56.784 --> 06:57.818
I'm not putting
you in the middle.

06:57.851 --> 06:59.419
It's just the umbilical
cord connecting you two

06:59.453 --> 07:00.588
only reaches so far.

07:00.621 --> 07:01.922
Enough, Bryan.

07:01.955 --> 07:04.257
The pissing contest has been
called on account of the baby.

07:04.291 --> 07:06.727
My mother will be a presence
in our child's life.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.228
Now, you guys have got
to sit down like adults

07:08.261 --> 07:09.930
and work it out.

07:09.963 --> 07:12.566
Fine.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.469
But if there were an actual
pissing contest, I would win.

07:19.807 --> 07:22.275
We get it, Jennifer Garner.

07:22.309 --> 07:23.944
You take your kids to the park.

07:23.977 --> 07:25.779
Mrs. Forrest,

07:25.813 --> 07:27.114
what are you
doing here?

07:27.147 --> 07:28.682
I need to see a doctor.

07:28.716 --> 07:32.352
My crappy hotel TV
doesn't get Dr. Oz and my HMO

07:32.385 --> 07:34.354
only recommends doctors in Ohio.

07:34.387 --> 07:35.856
Okay, what kind of doctor
do you need?

07:35.889 --> 07:37.224
I'm rooting for a psychiatrist.

07:38.659 --> 07:40.794
I need, a, um, uh...

07:40.828 --> 07:42.029
a doctor that, um...

07:42.062 --> 07:45.799
I need a doctor who does
what you do, but not you.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.635
You'd feel more comfortable
with a female gynecologist.

07:47.668 --> 07:50.437
Wrong, no woman is touching
my vagina, not even me.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.640
Well, uh, Dr. Venkatashar
is very...

07:52.673 --> 07:55.208
No snake charmers,
please, please.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.780
Why don't you just
tell me what's going on?

07:59.813 --> 08:01.949
I promise everything
you say in this room

08:01.982 --> 08:03.884
will remain
absolutely confidential.

08:06.153 --> 08:07.187
It's okay.

08:11.258 --> 08:12.826
Okay.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.662
Last night I felt this

08:14.695 --> 08:18.999
very strange tingling sensation.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.133
Uh-huh.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.502
And then I became
very light-headed.

08:22.536 --> 08:25.072
Mmm.
I believe that
what I had

08:25.105 --> 08:27.207
was a petite mal seizure.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.508
I learned this on Dr. Oz.

08:28.542 --> 08:33.480
Did you do anything
unusual last night?

08:33.513 --> 08:36.016
Unusual? Um, uh, no.

08:36.049 --> 08:39.853
It was just a typical night
at my hotel.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.929
I watched TV...

08:48.962 --> 08:52.132
and then I went right to sleep.

08:55.603 --> 08:57.537
Mrs. Forrest, by any chance,

08:57.571 --> 08:58.872
did you have sex last night?

08:58.906 --> 09:00.608
Please!

09:00.641 --> 09:03.110
Okay.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.714
I did.

09:06.747 --> 09:08.348
I had relations with a man.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.283
See, now, that wasn't
that hard to say, now was it?

09:10.317 --> 09:11.451
Not for you.

09:11.484 --> 09:13.386
You've probably
been saying it since

09:13.420 --> 09:14.688
you were 14 years old.

09:14.722 --> 09:16.556
Now, what happened to me?
What was it?

09:16.590 --> 09:17.791
Well, I believe you had

09:17.825 --> 09:19.559
what we in the
medical profession

09:19.593 --> 09:22.395
refer to as an orgasm.

09:30.971 --> 09:34.407
(singing in Spanish)

09:45.485 --> 09:47.187
Hey.

09:48.355 --> 09:49.556
That was great.
That was great.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.825
Woo, well done.

09:51.859 --> 09:53.160
Oh, wow, my ears.

09:53.193 --> 09:54.628
What do you think,
baby, fun, huh?

09:54.662 --> 09:55.796
SHANIA:
This is the most awesome
quinceañera

09:55.829 --> 09:58.231
I could ever imagine.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.733
Now I can cross that off my
California bucket list, too.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.769
What is that word
you keep saying?

10:01.802 --> 10:03.470
I don't speak Mexican.

10:03.503 --> 10:05.072
It's a quinceañera, Nana.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.808
It's a rite of passage for every
15-year-old Latin girl.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.743
You should try
to get into the spirit.

10:09.777 --> 10:10.778
Lovely.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.849
*

10:15.883 --> 10:17.584
Ooh, after you, señorita.

10:17.617 --> 10:18.819
Get in there, Mama.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.193
You gonna talk to my mom?

10:26.226 --> 10:27.460
Sure.

10:27.494 --> 10:30.530
In her last, dying days,
I may offer up a, "Feel better,"

10:30.563 --> 10:32.933
or, "Great view
of the river, huh?"

10:32.966 --> 10:34.367
But until then,
she has no interest

10:34.401 --> 10:37.170
in anything I have to say.

10:37.204 --> 10:39.673
*

10:39.707 --> 10:41.008
About yesterday.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.376
You shouldn't
be embarrassed.

10:43.410 --> 10:46.379
I mean, I assuming that you and
your husband didn't exactly

10:46.413 --> 10:48.648
have a tremendous
sexual connection,

10:48.682 --> 10:49.983
seeing as he turned
out to be gay.

10:50.017 --> 10:53.020
I am not having
this conversation with you.

10:53.053 --> 10:56.389
Jane, you are a fit, attractive,

10:56.423 --> 11:00.393
horribly offensive woman whose
sexuality is alive and kicking.

11:00.427 --> 11:01.962
You need to embrace it.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.364
I mean, most people
over 50 don't have

11:04.397 --> 11:05.699
a sex life to speak of.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.167
After week,
after The Mentalist,

11:07.200 --> 11:09.569
we make love for
six minutes, on the button.

11:09.602 --> 11:11.338
It's quite intense.

11:12.605 --> 11:14.541
The sex used to be pleasant,

11:14.574 --> 11:16.844
then my life change came.

11:16.877 --> 11:20.848
Got dried up like
goldfish food down there.

11:20.881 --> 11:25.218
In my country, older women
are prized as sexual goddesses,

11:25.252 --> 11:26.987
but here in the U.S.,

11:27.020 --> 11:30.390
only skinny young
supermodels are valued.

11:30.423 --> 11:32.559
I blame Tyra Banks.

11:32.592 --> 11:34.161
Thanks for the tip,

11:34.194 --> 11:35.729
but I am not talking about
my personal life

11:35.763 --> 11:38.365
with a boy who is attracted
to his own genitals.

11:38.398 --> 11:42.602
Fine. But you should
talk to someone.

11:42.635 --> 11:44.037
(mouthing)

11:44.071 --> 11:45.438
Maybe someone who...

11:45.472 --> 11:47.407
understands what
you're going through.

11:52.112 --> 11:54.114
Don't you just
love Latino food?

11:54.147 --> 11:56.216
It's so passionate
and sensual.

11:56.249 --> 11:57.684
Like Latino men.

11:57.717 --> 11:58.852
Is that for real?

11:58.886 --> 12:01.021
Is what for real?

12:01.054 --> 12:02.890
You-- the whole "I'm 60

12:02.923 --> 12:04.925
and I'm still
a sexual animal" bit,

12:04.958 --> 12:07.094
because it smells like
bullcrap to me.

12:07.127 --> 12:10.363
David's father was a
swashbuckler in the bedroom.

12:10.397 --> 12:13.801
Had a huge sword and knew
exactly where to stab.

12:13.834 --> 12:16.403
When I finally knew I
needed to leave Marty,

12:16.436 --> 12:18.906
I was afraid I'd never be
satisfied like that again.

12:18.939 --> 12:23.877
Turns out I have more
multi-plateaued orgasms now

12:23.911 --> 12:25.145
than I ever did.

12:25.178 --> 12:26.379
And how about you?

12:26.413 --> 12:28.081
With a tight tushy
like yours,

12:28.115 --> 12:30.483
I imagine you have no
trouble attracting the beef.

12:33.486 --> 12:35.722
Well, I did meet a man
the other night.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.257
And things got intimate.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.192
But that's all
I'm going to say.

12:40.493 --> 12:42.295
He did really get me
thinking, though.

12:42.329 --> 12:46.499
How can I be so dead-on
about politics

12:46.533 --> 12:50.403
and race relations
and so damn stupid

12:50.437 --> 12:52.005
about my own personal life?

12:52.039 --> 12:54.141
So much time wasted;

12:54.174 --> 12:56.476
so much time
I'll never get back.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.579
De-licious.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.449
Truly, just divine.

13:02.482 --> 13:04.284
Was that gerbil?

13:04.317 --> 13:07.320
I like to please my husband.
(sultry chuckle)

13:07.354 --> 13:08.989
You know what I was thinking?

13:09.022 --> 13:11.491
I was thinking
that maybe you and I

13:11.524 --> 13:13.360
could take our dessert
into the bedroom.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.865
(laughs)
Honey... the crumbs.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.166
Oh, but it's pudding.

13:19.199 --> 13:20.834
Oh, my gosh, uh...

13:20.868 --> 13:22.602
I am such a ninny.

13:22.635 --> 13:25.205
I left the lights on
at the pet store.

13:25.238 --> 13:26.706
If I don't go, the
parrots won't sleep,

13:26.739 --> 13:28.909
and will give me
real heck tomorrow.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.478
Don't wait up.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.948
So your husband
cheated on you.

13:34.982 --> 13:37.117
Mine, too.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.452
Suddenly, I was 52,
and society was telling me

13:39.486 --> 13:41.488
I was no longer a sexual being.

13:41.521 --> 13:42.789
Screw them.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.225
I learned my erotic
essence didn't die

13:45.258 --> 13:46.626
just because my marriage did.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.029
That thing between your legs

13:49.062 --> 13:51.698
only turns into an elbow
if you let it.

13:53.666 --> 13:57.337
*

14:02.842 --> 14:04.411
You can do this.

14:04.444 --> 14:07.380
*

14:11.618 --> 14:12.752
Oops.

14:23.530 --> 14:24.898
Couldn't sleep.

14:24.932 --> 14:26.333
All that spicy food

14:26.366 --> 14:28.268
has my stomach doing
the cha-cha-cha.

14:32.239 --> 14:33.907
Ooh, I guess we both
have tender tummies.

14:33.941 --> 14:35.909
There's no one
else here, Frances.

14:35.943 --> 14:37.177
You can leave the bubbly
effervescence to the seltzer.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.112
Fine.
You and I need to talk.

14:39.146 --> 14:40.113
We are talking.

14:40.147 --> 14:42.082
Words coming out of
my mouth,

14:42.115 --> 14:44.117
and your eyes are squinting
with crippling judgment.

14:44.151 --> 14:45.919
It's the same conversation
we always have.

14:45.953 --> 14:47.354
Stop that.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.957
We owe it to David, and more
importantly, to this baby,

14:49.990 --> 14:51.724
to work out our
differences,

14:51.758 --> 14:53.526
so let's just
cut the sarcasm

14:53.560 --> 14:56.463
and have an honest conversation
about our feelings.

14:56.496 --> 14:57.697
Great. Truth?

14:57.730 --> 14:59.766
You over-share
and you suck the air

14:59.799 --> 15:01.201
out of every room
you walk into.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.535
News flash, Bryan:

15:02.569 --> 15:06.806
You are a self-absorbed,
insecure smug little princess.

15:06.839 --> 15:08.075
Well, joke's on you,

15:08.108 --> 15:09.876
'cause that's exactly
what I was going for.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.878
(laughs)
I should've known
you weren't mature enough

15:11.911 --> 15:13.413
to have a real
communication.

15:13.446 --> 15:14.881
Oh! Oh, I'm not mature?

15:14.914 --> 15:17.217
Whenever you're here,
you go out of your way

15:17.250 --> 15:18.551
to pretend that I'm not
even in the room;

15:18.585 --> 15:21.221
that David is the only
one who exists.

15:21.254 --> 15:24.124
Look, I get that you love him;
he's your son.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.326
But I think when
you left your husband,

15:26.359 --> 15:28.228
you were so desperate
for the love of a man

15:28.261 --> 15:29.229
that you latched
onto the only one

15:29.262 --> 15:30.730
you knew would never leave you

15:30.763 --> 15:32.565
and you turned your little boy
into your little boyfriend.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.835
I guess, if we're playing
amateur psychologist--

15:35.868 --> 15:38.171
how come I've never
met your mother, Bryan?

15:38.205 --> 15:40.907
I know you haven't talked
to her since your dad died.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.343
You never call her,
you don't visit.

15:43.376 --> 15:46.146
Does she even know
you're having a baby?

15:46.179 --> 15:47.981
(quietly):
Wow.

15:48.015 --> 15:51.251
I guess you need to work out
your own mommy issues,

15:51.284 --> 15:53.686
and stop taking your crap
out on me.

15:56.223 --> 15:57.624
So what do you want to do?

15:57.657 --> 15:59.859
Do you want to go to dinner,
maybe see a movie?

15:59.892 --> 16:02.595
I feel so good,
I could listen to live jazz.

16:02.629 --> 16:06.533
Yeah, Jane, no offense,
but I don't want to date you,

16:06.566 --> 16:07.834
I just want to bang you.

16:07.867 --> 16:09.702
Bang me?!
Yeah.

16:09.736 --> 16:10.870
Is that what this was?

16:10.903 --> 16:12.439
(groaning):
Oh, boy.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.541
This is what drives me
nuts about older women.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.943
You think that you can go out
and get laid,

16:16.976 --> 16:18.778
and not get emotionally
attached, but you can't.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.780
You just have to turn it
into a relationship.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.949
Oh, don't flatter yourself, bud.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.884
If I was looking
for a relationship,

16:24.917 --> 16:26.486
I imagine I'd aim
a little bit higher

16:26.519 --> 16:28.288
than a vitamin salesman.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.057
Yeah, well, I'd like to imagine
that this was 1980,

16:30.090 --> 16:31.291
and you were still super-hot,

16:31.324 --> 16:32.692
then I wouldn't have
to close my eyes

16:32.725 --> 16:33.693
and pretend I'm banging

16:33.726 --> 16:34.794
a 22-year-old version of you.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.697
Is that what you were thinking?

16:37.730 --> 16:40.167
No, I was really thinking,
"Wow, I'm such a lucky guy

16:40.200 --> 16:42.969
to be screwing a woman who was
alive before computers!"

16:43.002 --> 16:45.472
I wouldn't have given you
the time of day when I was 22.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.374
Exactly.

16:47.407 --> 16:48.841
But look at what
you gave me now.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.446
You know you're fat, right?

16:54.681 --> 16:56.449
(door slams)

17:02.622 --> 17:03.890
Here we are--

17:03.923 --> 17:06.025
wild Pacific salmon
with wasabi crème fraiche.

17:06.059 --> 17:08.195
Oh, my gosh,
it looks amazing.

17:08.228 --> 17:09.929
The center belly section
is the most flavorful.

17:09.962 --> 17:11.531
I want my son
to have it.

17:11.564 --> 17:12.699
Of course you do.

17:12.732 --> 17:14.901
Mom...

17:15.735 --> 17:16.803
Enjoy it, son.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.676
Wow, Frances.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.945
The only thing I'd do different
is bread it, fry it

17:25.978 --> 17:27.847
and add tartar sauce,
but other than that,

17:27.880 --> 17:28.848
it looks really good.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.117
Well, Shania said
she wanted

17:30.150 --> 17:32.852
authentic California cuisine,
and lucky for her,

17:32.885 --> 17:35.522
we have a four-star chef
in the house.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.190
And that's the last thing
on my bucket list.

17:37.224 --> 17:39.126
I guess I can go
back to Ohio.

17:39.159 --> 17:41.228
Oh, thank you.

17:41.261 --> 17:42.895
Yeah.

17:48.435 --> 17:49.736
(coughs)

17:49.769 --> 17:52.205
You okay?
What's the matter, honey?
You okay?

17:52.239 --> 17:54.641
I ate a glob of green pudding.
Fire, fire in my mouth!

17:54.674 --> 17:56.042
Oh!
Oh!

17:56.075 --> 17:57.244
Oh, my God, the wasabi.
The wasabi!

17:57.277 --> 17:58.745
Oh, my God, here,
have some water.
Take some water.

17:58.778 --> 18:00.747
I'm gonna barf.
Okay.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.982
Okay, uh, please use
the housekeeper's toilet.

18:03.015 --> 18:04.584
Got it!
Or any of the ones

18:04.617 --> 18:07.053
with the vintage Malibu tile.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.755
Well, I hope she's good.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.056
Laverne? Shirley?

18:10.089 --> 18:11.057
Doesn't she knock?

18:11.090 --> 18:13.226
Where are the people I like?

18:13.260 --> 18:15.094
Shania ate a glob of wasabi,
and now she's throwing up.

18:15.128 --> 18:16.829
And Goldie is mopping
her tiny face

18:16.863 --> 18:18.097
with Frette hand towels

18:18.131 --> 18:19.832
like they're very, very
expensive Kleenex.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.601
I feel terrible.

18:21.634 --> 18:22.935
Oh, no, don't.
Shania is just fine.

18:22.969 --> 18:24.937
You know, she said it was
as delicious coming back up

18:24.971 --> 18:26.105
as it was going down.

18:26.139 --> 18:27.140
(laughter)

18:27.174 --> 18:28.575
That kid is amazing.
She's fearless.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.076
I know.
JANE:
Fearless?!

18:30.109 --> 18:32.579
Let me tell you something--
fear is good!

18:32.612 --> 18:34.414
And you should
feel terrible

18:34.447 --> 18:37.784
with your crappy fish and
your idiotic ideas about life.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.619
They hurt people's feelings.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.354
And their stomachs.

18:41.388 --> 18:43.190
Nana, Shania is
living her life.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.458
She's nine years old
and made a list of

18:45.492 --> 18:47.460
all the things she wanted
to do and guess what?

18:47.494 --> 18:48.628
She did them.

18:48.661 --> 18:49.962
Can you say the
same thing?

18:49.996 --> 18:51.764
I can't.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.866
People aren't always
supposed to do everything
they think they should do.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.435
It's what separates us
from the animals.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.470
And the native Hawaiians.

18:57.504 --> 19:01.974
Well... all I know is Shania
will never forget today.

19:02.008 --> 19:03.443
So, thank you.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.645
I don't regret
the things I've done.

19:05.678 --> 19:08.047
Only the things
I wanted to do,

19:08.080 --> 19:09.416
and never did.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.488
Hey, there she is.

19:15.522 --> 19:17.123
I feel much better now.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.326
Sorry about your rug.

19:19.359 --> 19:20.360
And your dog.

19:20.393 --> 19:21.661
Ooh.
(dog barks)

19:21.694 --> 19:26.333
Well, you know, if you break
open a capsule of vitamin E,

19:26.366 --> 19:29.068
and you dab just a little
bit of the gel down there,

19:29.101 --> 19:30.803
you'll be amazed how intense
the sensation will be.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.805
JANE:
Paul, what are you
doing here?

19:32.839 --> 19:34.907
I thought it was
your daughter's birthday.

19:34.941 --> 19:37.244
Uh... daughter?

19:37.277 --> 19:39.412
She's only one.
She probably won't remember.

19:39.446 --> 19:41.848
No, no, no, no, don't...

19:43.216 --> 19:45.017
Oh, thanks a lot.

19:45.051 --> 19:46.653
No, thank you. A lot.

19:46.686 --> 19:49.656
For teaching me that it's
never too late to start my life.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.424
You ready, babe?
Yeah.

19:51.458 --> 19:53.693
No regrets.

20:00.767 --> 20:01.768
Well, you can breathe again.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.570
Mom is on her
way back to Napa.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.705
Look, I'm not saying we're
gonna be best friends

20:05.738 --> 20:07.707
anytime soon but...

20:07.740 --> 20:09.509
she did make me feel very good
at dinner tonight.

20:09.542 --> 20:10.877
And if I'm being honest,

20:10.910 --> 20:12.779
she might be a slightly
better cook than I am.

20:12.812 --> 20:15.382
But if we ever have that
pissing contest, it is on.

20:15.415 --> 20:17.049
I'm going to bed.
You coming?

20:17.083 --> 20:19.051
I'll be right up.
There's something I have to do.

20:19.085 --> 20:20.152
Okay.

20:39.672 --> 20:41.674
(line ringing)

20:44.176 --> 20:45.312
WOMAN:
Hello?

20:45.345 --> 20:48.348
Hey, Mom, it's me.

20:54.854 --> 20:56.222
Come on, Shania!
Really hit it, Shania.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.291
Oh, come on! Oh!
Yeah!

20:58.325 --> 20:59.459
Wowie, we-wah!

20:59.492 --> 21:00.627
That looks fun.
Whoo! Arriba!

21:00.660 --> 21:01.794
That's good, baby.

21:01.828 --> 21:03.863
GOLDIE:
That's cheating! Whoa!

21:05.465 --> 21:08.067
Oh, my gosh!
Bryan, stop it!

21:08.100 --> 21:10.136
Whoa! Calm down.

21:11.938 --> 21:14.240
Wow! Bryan,
you're so strong!

21:14.273 --> 21:15.675
Candy!

21:15.708 --> 21:16.809
Oh, goody!

21:16.843 --> 21:17.910
(man singing in Spanish)

21:17.944 --> 21:21.748
GOLDIE: Okay, candy! Yay!
Be careful!

21:21.781 --> 21:23.850
That's enough, honey.
