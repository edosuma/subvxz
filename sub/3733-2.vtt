WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:06.231
- Previously on Hannibal...
- I've killed hardly anybody
during our residence.

00:06.270 --> 00:08.261
- What are you doing in
Florence, working with Roman?

00:08.300 --> 00:11.736
- Roman is speaking to the
Studiolo Friday. You
should come.

00:11.770 --> 00:14.432
- What wickedness has your
attention, Mr. Dimmond?

00:14.480 --> 00:17.369
- Yours, Dr. Fell.
- Are you here to twist me

00:17.410 --> 00:20.379
into an uncomfortable position?
- I'm here to help you untwist.

00:20.420 --> 00:23.218
- Snails prefer
eating with company.

00:23.250 --> 00:25.810
If only that company
could be Will Graham.

00:25.850 --> 00:27.818
- Is Will Graham still alive?

00:27.860 --> 00:30.579
- Will was not a suitable
substitute for therapy.

00:30.630 --> 00:33.258
- What have you done, Hannibal?

01:17.610 --> 01:19.601
(whimpering)

01:26.780 --> 01:28.816
- Abigail...

01:28.850 --> 01:31.739
- I didn't know
what else to do,

01:31.790 --> 01:34.350
so I just did
what he told me.

01:38.390 --> 01:40.858
- Where is he?

01:52.810 --> 01:56.576
- You were supposed
to leave.

02:02.890 --> 02:05.211
- We _couldn't leave
wrthout you.

02:21.500 --> 02:24.162
(blade sticking)
(groaning)

02:36.620 --> 02:39.316
- Time did reverse.

02:39.360 --> 02:43.353
The teacup that I shattered
dared to come together.

02:45.360 --> 02:48.898
A place was made for Abigail
in your world.

02:48.930 --> 02:51.421
Do you understand?

02:54.300 --> 02:58.600
That place was made
for all of us. Together.

03:02.950 --> 03:05.305
I wanted to surprise you.

03:07.650 --> 03:10.687
And you...

03:10.720 --> 03:12.881
You wanted to surprise me.

03:16.490 --> 03:19.493
(choking and gasping)

03:23.570 --> 03:26.289
I let you know me.

03:28.300 --> 03:30.268
See me.

03:30.310 --> 03:33.871
I gave you a rare gift.

03:36.780 --> 03:39.749
But you didn't want it.
- (voice trembling): Didn't I?

03:42.020 --> 03:43.988
- You would deny me my life.

03:44.020 --> 03:46.557
- No... No.

03:46.590 --> 03:48.558
Not your life.

03:48.590 --> 03:50.729
- My freedom, then.
You would take that from me.

03:52.630 --> 03:56.327
Confine me to a prison cell.

04:03.470 --> 04:05.461
Do you believe
you could change me

04:05.510 --> 04:07.501
the way I've changed you?

04:12.680 --> 04:14.671
- I already did.

04:21.820 --> 04:24.027
- Fate and circumstance
have returned us

04:24.060 --> 04:27.518
to this moment

04:27.560 --> 04:31.564
when the teacup shatters.

04:36.440 --> 04:38.704
I forgive you, Will.

04:41.810 --> 04:44.074
Will you forgive me?

04:44.110 --> 04:48.718
- (mumbling): Don't... Don't...

04:48.750 --> 04:52.288
Oh, no... No, no...

04:59.430 --> 05:01.352
No... No...

05:05.570 --> 05:07.993
(sob)

05:08.040 --> 05:11.965
(Will and Abigail screaming)

05:14.480 --> 05:17.540
(choking and gasping)
AH! AH! AH!

05:23.750 --> 05:26.412
- You can make it all go away.

05:26.460 --> 05:29.554
Put your head back.

05:29.590 --> 05:32.491
Close your eyes.

05:34.530 --> 05:37.658
Wade into the quiet
of the stream.

05:41.440 --> 05:44.932
(groaning)

07:02.220 --> 07:04.688
(sharp shattering sound)

07:04.720 --> 07:06.984
(tinkling)

07:24.870 --> 07:26.872
(heart monitor beeping)

07:49.130 --> 07:51.121
- (man): How do you feel?

07:53.640 --> 07:56.165
- Thirsty.

08:03.980 --> 08:06.574
(sipping weakly)

08:08.580 --> 08:11.185
- There's someone here very
anxious to see you.

08:34.310 --> 08:37.802
(theme music playing)

09:19.620 --> 09:22.885
- They told me he knew exactly
how to cut me.

09:24.890 --> 09:27.256
They said it was surgical.

09:27.300 --> 09:31.122
He wanted us to live.

09:31.170 --> 09:34.867
- He left us to die.

09:34.900 --> 09:36.936
- But we didn't.

09:39.140 --> 09:42.234
He was supposed
to take me with him.

09:42.280 --> 09:44.805
We were all supposed
to leave together.

09:44.850 --> 09:47.011
He made a place for us.

09:47.050 --> 09:50.679
- Abigail...
- Why did you lie to him?

09:52.890 --> 09:55.916
- The wrong thing being the
right thing to do was...

09:58.330 --> 10:00.992
...was too ugly a thought.

10:03.300 --> 10:05.621
- He gave you a chance
to take it all back

10:05.670 --> 10:08.833
and you just kept lying.

10:08.870 --> 10:12.260
No one had to die.

10:17.180 --> 10:19.307
- It's hard to grasp

10:19.350 --> 10:22.979
what would've happened,

10:23.020 --> 10:25.079
what could've happened,

10:25.120 --> 10:27.918
and in some other world
did happen.

10:27.960 --> 10:32.124
- I'm having a hard enough time
dealing with this world.

10:32.160 --> 10:34.390
Hope some of the other worlds

10:34.430 --> 10:37.888
are...easier on me.

10:39.940 --> 10:43.034
- Everything that
can happen, happens.

10:45.110 --> 10:47.135
It has to end well

10:47.180 --> 10:49.808
and it has to end badly.

10:51.810 --> 10:55.712
It has to _end
every way It can.

10:59.890 --> 11:02.154
This is the way
it ended for us.

11:04.260 --> 11:06.820
- We don't have an ending.

11:06.860 --> 11:10.068
He didn't give us one yet.

11:10.100 --> 11:13.331
He wants us to find him.

11:19.370 --> 11:22.999
- After everything he's done,
you'd still go to him?

11:27.880 --> 11:29.939
- If everything
that can happen, happens,

11:29.990 --> 11:33.153
then you can never really do
the wrong thing.

11:36.390 --> 11:39.154
You're just doing
what you're supposed to.

11:58.550 --> 12:00.745
(groaning)

13:10.550 --> 13:12.211
- When we have gone
from this life,

13:12.250 --> 13:14.957
I will always
have this place.

13:14.990 --> 13:17.356
- In yo
ur "m
emory palace"?

13:17.390 --> 13:22.054
- My palace is vast,
even by medieval standards.

13:22.100 --> 13:25.422
The foyer is the Norman Chapel
in Palermo;

13:25.470 --> 13:29.361
severe, beautiful,
and timeless,

13:29.400 --> 13:32.437
with a single reminder
of mortality:

13:32.470 --> 13:35.507
a skull graven in the floor.

14:28.700 --> 14:32.158
(bursting)

14:47.580 --> 14:50.048
- Even in an
enlightened world,

14:50.090 --> 14:52.957
we come here to feel
closer to God.

14:52.990 --> 14:55.515
- Do you feel closer to God?

14:58.630 --> 15:00.996
- God's not who
I came here to find.

15:28.090 --> 15:31.150
- Do you believe in God?

15:33.100 --> 15:35.056
- What I believe is_ closer
to scrence fiction

15:35.100 --> 15:37.068
than anything
in the Bible.

15:37.100 --> 15:41.161
- We all know it, but nobody
ever says that G-dash-D

15:41.200 --> 15:44.738
won't do a G-dash-D-damned thing
to answer anybody's prayers.

15:44.770 --> 15:48.570
- God can't save any of us

15:48.610 --> 15:51.670
because it's inelegant.

15:51.710 --> 15:56.079
Elegance is more important
than suffering.

15:56.120 --> 15:59.317
That's His design.

16:01.320 --> 16:03.584
- You talking about God
or Hannibal?

16:07.030 --> 16:09.021
- Hannibal's not God.

16:10.770 --> 16:14.536
Wouldn't have any fun being God.

16:14.570 --> 16:17.038
Defying God,

16:17.070 --> 16:21.279
that's his idea of a good time.

16:27.650 --> 16:31.017
Nothing would thrill Hannibal
more than to see this roof

16:31.050 --> 16:34.053
collapse mid-Mass,

16:34.090 --> 16:37.457
packed pews, choir singing...

16:37.490 --> 16:41.722
He would just love it.

16:45.200 --> 16:47.760
And he thinks

16:47.800 --> 16:51.167
God would love it, too.

16:59.280 --> 17:02.647
(crumbling sound)

17:51.400 --> 17:53.391
(camera flash booming)

17:57.840 --> 18:01.071
(conversing indistinctly)

18:09.920 --> 18:13.686
- Is it him?

18:16.690 --> 18:18.658
- Per favore, signore.

18:18.690 --> 18:20.499
proibito qui.
La cappella chiusa.

18:20.530 --> 18:23.192
- LaManna, non lasciarlo uscire.

18:23.230 --> 18:26.290
Voglio parlare con lui.
- What did he say?

18:26.330 --> 18:29.458
- He said he wants
to talk to you.

18:46.450 --> 18:49.089
- Signor Graham...

18:52.960 --> 18:55.827
- Chief Investigator
Rinaldo Pazzi.

18:55.860 --> 18:58.192
Questura di Firenze.

19:00.200 --> 19:02.691
- You're a long way
from Florence.

19:02.740 --> 19:05.208
- You're a long way
from Baltimore.

19:05.240 --> 19:08.437
I read everything

19:08.480 --> 19:12.576
I can find on
FBI profiling methods.

19:12.610 --> 19:15.408
I read all about

19:15.450 --> 19:17.418
your incarceration.

19:17.450 --> 19:21.159
- Keep reading.
I was acquitted.

19:25.830 --> 19:28.196
- You come to Palermo

19:28.230 --> 19:32.394
and soon -- very soon -- a body
is discovered.

19:32.430 --> 19:35.831
- The priest at the
Cappella dei Normanni

19:35.870 --> 19:39.863
said you have been spending
a lot of time there.

19:41.880 --> 19:43.848
- I've been praying.

19:43.880 --> 19:47.771
- There_ is some comfort
In prayer.

19:47.820 --> 19:51.938
It leaves you with
the distinct feeling

19:51.990 --> 19:54.584
you're not alone.

19:58.890 --> 20:01.893
- Signore...

20:01.930 --> 20:04.467
Vieni con me.

20:09.800 --> 20:12.462
- Ciao.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.390
- Is Will Graham here because of
the body at the cappella,

20:40.440 --> 20:42.499
or is the body here

20:42.540 --> 20:44.508
because of Will Graham?

20:44.540 --> 20:46.701
- Why are you here?
- I'm like you.

20:46.740 --> 20:50.471
I do what you do.

20:50.510 --> 20:54.514
We share the gift
of imagination.

20:54.550 --> 20:57.542
- I've got the scars
of a man

20:57.590 --> 20:59.808
who grabbed his gift
by the blade.

20:59.850 --> 21:02.614
- You grabbed the wrong end.
(Will chuckling)

21:02.660 --> 21:06.482
Those moments when the
connection is made,

21:06.530 --> 21:10.022
that is my keenest pleasure.

21:10.060 --> 21:13.461
- Knowing.

21:13.500 --> 21:15.559
- Knowing.

21:15.600 --> 21:19.434
Not feeling, not thinking.

21:19.470 --> 21:22.837
You know who murdered
that man

21:22.880 --> 21:25.041
and left him in
the Cappella Palatina.

21:25.080 --> 21:28.743
- Don't you know?

21:28.780 --> 21:33.319
- I met him 20 years ago.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.988
Il Mostro,

21:36.020 --> 21:39.558
the Monster of Florence.

21:39.590 --> 21:41.797
It was his custom to arrange
his victims

21:41.830 --> 21:43.798
like a beautiful painting.

21:43.830 --> 21:47.561
- Il Mostro created images

21:47.600 --> 21:50.706
that stayed in my mind.

21:50.740 --> 21:54.506
- 20 years ago,

21:54.540 --> 21:57.646
I was dwelling on a couple
found slain

21:57.680 --> 21:59.671
in the bed of a pickup truck

21:59.710 --> 22:01.871
in Impruneta.

22:01.920 --> 22:04.912
Bodies placed garlanded
with flowers...

22:04.950 --> 22:08.852
- Like a Botticelli.

22:08.890 --> 22:12.519
- Exactly like a Botticelli.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.968
- His painting Primavera

22:21.000 --> 22:23.798
still hangs in the Uffizi
Gallery in Florence,

22:23.840 --> 22:27.003
just as it did 20 years ago.

22:27.040 --> 22:29.099
The garlanded nymph
on the right,

22:29.140 --> 22:33.611
the flowers streaming from her
mouth, match.

22:33.650 --> 22:36.869
Match...

22:36.920 --> 22:40.811
The Uffizi Gallery --

22:40.860 --> 22:44.489
that's where you met il Mostro.

22:44.530 --> 22:48.057
- That's where I met...

22:48.100 --> 22:52.366
...this man.

22:54.570 --> 22:58.609
The Monster of Florence.

23:05.450 --> 23:08.544
Success comes as a result
of inspiration.

23:08.580 --> 23:14.018
Revelation is the development

23:14.060 --> 23:16.483
of an image,

23:16.520 --> 23:21.150
first blurred,
then coming clear.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.998
To find the inspiration
il Mostro used

23:24.030 --> 23:25.998
was a triumph.

23:26.030 --> 23:28.828
I went to the Uffizi
and stood before

23:28.870 --> 23:31.464
the original Primavera
day after day

23:31.510 --> 23:33.535
and most days

23:33.580 --> 23:36.606
I'd see a young Lithuanian man

23:36.640 --> 23:40.849
as transfixed
by the Botticelli as I was;

23:40.880 --> 23:45.613
as transfixed as I imagined
il Mostro would be.

23:45.650 --> 23:49.450
And every day I saw him...

23:49.490 --> 23:52.948
...he_ would recreate
the Primavera in penCIl,

23:52.990 --> 23:57.222
just as he did in flesh.

23:57.260 --> 24:00.730
I knew.

24:00.770 --> 24:03.238
It was the best moment
of my life,

24:03.270 --> 24:05.158
a moment of epiphany

24:05.210 --> 24:07.906
that made me famous

24:07.940 --> 24:11.649
and then ruined me.

24:11.680 --> 24:14.547
In haste and the heat
of ambition,

24:14.580 --> 24:17.242
the Questura nearly destroyed
the young man's home

24:17.280 --> 24:20.579
trying to find evidence.
- Well...

24:20.620 --> 24:24.021
He doesn't leave evidence.
- No, he doesn't.

24:24.060 --> 24:26.654
- He eats it.

24:26.690 --> 24:30.194
- Another man --
not an innocent man,

24:30.230 --> 24:32.790
but innocent of those crimes --

24:32.830 --> 24:34.889
was a dream suspect.

24:34.940 --> 24:38.137
He was convicted
on no eVIdence

24:38.170 --> 24:40.900
except his character.

24:40.940 --> 24:43.500
- Blame has a habit

24:43.550 --> 24:45.905
of not sticking
to Hannibal Lecter.

24:45.950 --> 24:49.078
-Hmm.

24:51.090 --> 24:54.651
- It has a habit
of sticking to you.

25:22.020 --> 25:24.284
(heart beating)

25:48.240 --> 25:51.243
- I splintered every bone,

25:51.280 --> 25:55.216
fractured them

25:55.250 --> 25:58.310
dynamically.

25:58.350 --> 26:02.184
Made you malleable.

26:04.730 --> 26:06.721
I skinned you,

26:10.670 --> 26:12.661
bent you,

26:15.070 --> 26:18.631
twisted you

26:18.670 --> 26:22.128
and trimmed you,

26:22.180 --> 26:25.343
head, hands, arms, and legs.

26:27.350 --> 26:31.013
(chuckling)
A topiary.

26:40.130 --> 26:41.950
This is my design.

26:46.900 --> 26:50.199
(heart beating)

26:50.240 --> 26:54.370
A valentine written on
a broken man.

28:10.450 --> 28:12.839
(gasping)

28:18.830 --> 28:22.322
(gasping and panting)

28:29.440 --> 28:32.000
- I do feel closer
to Hannibal here.

28:32.040 --> 28:35.373
(laughing)

28:35.410 --> 28:38.277
- God only knows where
I'd be without him.

28:46.290 --> 28:48.281
He left us his, uh...

28:48.320 --> 28:52.029
...his broken heart.

28:54.030 --> 28:56.294
- How did he know we were here?

28:56.330 --> 28:59.299
- He didn't.

28:59.330 --> 29:02.834
But he knew we would come.

29:05.170 --> 29:07.365
- He misses us.

29:12.480 --> 29:15.517
- Hannibal follows several
trains of thought at once

29:15.550 --> 29:20.044
without distraction from any --

29:20.090 --> 29:23.059
and one of the trains

29:23.090 --> 29:26.548
is always for his own amusement.

29:26.590 --> 29:29.889
- He's playing with us.

29:29.930 --> 29:32.023
- Always.

29:34.300 --> 29:37.758
You still want to go with him?

29:47.920 --> 29:50.218
- Yes.

29:53.390 --> 29:55.551
- He gave you back to me

29:55.590 --> 29:59.424
then he took you away.

29:59.460 --> 30:02.952
It's Lucy and the football.

30:03.000 --> 30:06.265
He just keeps
pulling you away.

30:11.270 --> 30:15.400
- What if no one died?
What if...

30:15.440 --> 30:18.898
What if we all left together?

30:18.950 --> 30:22.613
Like we were supposed to,

30:22.650 --> 30:26.313
after he served the lamb.

30:28.590 --> 30:30.979
Where would we have gone?

30:34.160 --> 30:36.458
- In some other world?

30:40.070 --> 30:42.061
- In some other world.

30:47.440 --> 30:51.240
- He said he made
a place for us.

30:56.520 --> 30:59.409
- A place was made
for you, Abigail,

30:59.450 --> 31:03.216
in this world.

31:07.290 --> 31:11.522
It was the only place I could
make for you.

32:59.640 --> 33:04.600
(gentle opera music playing)

34:25.190 --> 34:27.329
- Are you...

34:27.360 --> 34:29.351
...praying?

34:33.300 --> 34:36.497
- Hannibal doesn't pray.

34:36.540 --> 34:40.863
But he believes in God --
intimately.

34:40.910 --> 34:44.641
- I wasn't asking
Hannibal Lecter.

34:47.850 --> 34:50.648
- I think my prayers
would feel constricted

34:50.680 --> 34:56.118
by the saints and apostles

34:58.260 --> 35:01.821
and Jesus Pantocrator.

35:06.870 --> 35:10.465
How do your prayers feel?

35:10.500 --> 35:14.402
- I hope my prayers escaped,

35:14.440 --> 35:17.170
flown from here

35:17.210 --> 35:19.542
to the open slq and God.

35:19.580 --> 35:23.573
- Praying you catch him?

35:23.620 --> 35:26.145
You should be praying
he doesn't capture you.

35:26.190 --> 35:29.318
- I didn't head

35:29.360 --> 35:31.920
the Questura di Firenze
for nothing.

35:31.960 --> 35:34.349
- You couldn't catch him
when he was just a kid;

35:34.400 --> 35:38.393
what makes you think you're
going to catch him now?
- You.

35:38.430 --> 35:41.638
- What makes you think
I want to catch him?

35:45.940 --> 35:49.569
- Signor Graham...

35:49.610 --> 35:52.408
(softly speaking Italian)

36:08.830 --> 36:12.926
- If you could
possibly be content,

36:12.970 --> 36:17.498
I would suggest you let
il Mostro go.

36:17.540 --> 36:21.203
- I can't do that
any more than you can.

36:21.240 --> 36:24.346
- He's going to kill you,
you know.

36:26.750 --> 36:29.639
I'm usually right
about these things.

36:29.680 --> 36:32.444
- He let you know him.

36:32.490 --> 36:35.812
He sent you his heart.

36:38.590 --> 36:40.558
Where has he gone now?

36:40.590 --> 36:44.629
- He hasn't gone anywhere.

36:49.840 --> 36:53.560
He's still here.

38:02.080 --> 38:04.799
(clattering objects)

38:04.850 --> 38:07.501
- Hannibal!

39:14.550 --> 39:16.541
- Signor Graham?

39:42.040 --> 39:45.373
- You shouldn't be
down here alone.

39:50.920 --> 39:52.888
- I'm not alone.

39:52.920 --> 39:54.888
I'm with you.

39:54.920 --> 39:57.457
- You don't know
whose side I'm on.

40:02.730 --> 40:05.164
- What are you going
to do when you find him,

40:05.200 --> 40:07.794
your il Mostro?

40:12.070 --> 40:15.107
- I'm...

40:15.140 --> 40:18.075
I'm curious
about that myself.

40:25.620 --> 40:28.612
- You and I carry
the dead with us,

40:28.660 --> 40:30.787
Signor Graham.

40:30.820 --> 40:33.050
We both need to unburden.

40:33.090 --> 40:36.992
- Why don't you carry your dead
back to the chapel

40:37.030 --> 40:42.093
before you count
yourself among them?

40:47.240 --> 40:49.674
- You are already dead,

40:49.710 --> 40:51.701
aren't you?

40:56.880 --> 41:00.043
- Buonanotte, commendatore.

41:02.860 --> 41:05.522
(sighing)

41:44.800 --> 41:48.566
Hannibal...

42:07.950 --> 42:10.851
I forgive you.

42:31.010 --> 42:33.274
