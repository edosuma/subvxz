after Lemur School.

Just getting ready
for my Lemur School reunion.

01:01.019 --> 01:02.270
Gonna be some party.

01:02.353 --> 01:06.441
The theme is prom, which means
I'll be crowned prom king.

01:06.524 --> 01:07.817
Again! [laughs]

01:07.901 --> 01:10.862
But, you're already king-king,
so why does prom king matter?

01:10.945 --> 01:12.572
Oh, Maurice.

01:12.655 --> 01:16.785
Being prom king is way more important
than being a regular old king.

01:16.868 --> 01:17.911
Everybody knows that.

01:18.661 --> 01:21.372
Yeah, Maurice. Everybody knows that.

01:21.456 --> 01:22.791
Ah, prom sounds fun.

01:22.874 --> 01:26.795
I had a great time
at my prom at the academy. [laughs] Yeah.

please find your partner for...

Pugilistic Ruckus of Mayhem. Prom.

01:44.479 --> 01:45.647
-No.
-Uh-uh.

01:45.730 --> 01:48.483
Okay, weirdo. I remember my prom.

01:48.566 --> 01:52.070
Grammy planned it, on account of the fact
that I was home-schooled.

01:52.153 --> 01:53.905
Oh, it was perfect.

And I'm the weird one?

02:02.205 --> 02:06.626
Anyway. I don't know why you're not
more excited about the reunion, Maurice.

02:06.709 --> 02:09.629
This is your chance
to relive my glory days.

02:09.712 --> 02:12.423
When I was the most popular lemur
in school...

02:12.507 --> 02:14.050
Star of the football team.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.139
-Captain of the Debate Team.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.156
Obvious choice.

02:38.908 --> 02:39.826
And you're clearly forgetting

02:39.909 --> 02:42.912
that Lemur School is when I met
a very special person.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.581
I think you know who I'm talking about.

02:45.456 --> 02:47.333
-Thanks, Your-- Huh?
-Karen.

02:47.625 --> 02:48.960
Right, Karen.

02:49.043 --> 02:50.086
Who's Karen?

02:50.169 --> 02:52.714
Karen was Julien's
Lemur School girlfriend.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.216
Hey, Karen. 'Sup?

02:55.508 --> 02:57.802
New glove? Nice. Bump it.

02:58.386 --> 02:59.220
[chuckles]

02:59.304 --> 03:00.847
Prince Julien talked to me!

03:00.930 --> 03:02.348
He noticed my glove!

03:02.432 --> 03:04.767
I will never wash this gloved hand again!

03:04.851 --> 03:06.436
Never! Oh, Prince Julien!

03:06.561 --> 03:07.687
[sighs]

03:07.812 --> 03:09.981
Karen was the one that got away.

03:10.064 --> 03:13.234
From me, but not from the foosa
who ate her on prom night.

03:13.318 --> 03:15.111
May she rest in peace.

03:15.820 --> 03:18.197
[hums, kisses]

03:18.281 --> 03:20.116
Okay, good moment. That's over. Let's go.

Lots to do before reunion!

03:26.039 --> 03:29.918
Okay, everybody.
Step right up and get your nametags.

03:30.001 --> 03:32.545
That's right. Here you go, Pancho.

03:32.629 --> 03:35.131
And... Outta the way, Horst!

Lemur School.

03:43.473 --> 03:46.142
Some things never change.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.852
Rob! Sup, buddy?

03:47.936 --> 03:50.980
He put himself in a medically induced
coma again.

03:52.899 --> 03:54.484
[laughs]

03:54.692 --> 03:56.903
Coming to a reunion in a coma.

-Hello, Julien.
-[screams]

04:03.993 --> 04:06.246
What are you doing here, Karl?

04:06.329 --> 04:07.997
Don't you remember?

04:08.248 --> 04:12.126
I went to your school.
I was in all your classes.

04:12.210 --> 04:14.837
[laughs] I think I'd remember...

04:15.964 --> 04:16.839
Hi, Julien.

04:18.174 --> 04:19.884
Eh, Maurice, did you hear something?

04:21.261 --> 04:22.178
Hi, Julien.

04:22.762 --> 04:25.223
Eh, Maurice, did you hear something?

04:26.849 --> 04:27.850
Hi, Julien.

04:28.059 --> 04:30.061
Eh, Maurice, did you hear something?

04:30.561 --> 04:31.896
Eh... Mm.

04:32.230 --> 04:33.064
I got nothing.

04:33.147 --> 04:35.984
You didn't see me,
but I was there the whole time.

04:36.567 --> 04:37.568
Enjoy the party.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.113
I know I intend to.

04:41.239 --> 04:42.323
[snickers]

04:42.407 --> 04:45.618
Is it me, or did Karl
seem a little hostile?

04:45.702 --> 04:47.912
Uh-huh. And he's definitely
got an axe to grind

04:47.996 --> 04:50.456
with the whole
"you not noticing him in school" thing.

04:50.540 --> 04:53.418
[coughs] Just one more reason
this reunion was a bad idea.

04:53.876 --> 04:54.752
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

04:54.836 --> 04:56.296
I'll keep an eye on Karl.

04:56.379 --> 04:59.465
If my tail twitch is correct,
he's up to something,

04:59.549 --> 05:01.718
and I'm gonna find out what it is.

05:41.758 --> 05:42.759
It can't be.

05:42.842 --> 05:44.469
Karen was eaten by a foosa.

05:44.552 --> 05:46.429
May she rest in peace.

05:46.971 --> 05:48.973
No, it's me, Julien.

05:49.057 --> 05:51.476
Karen! You're really alive!

05:51.559 --> 05:53.102
It's good to see you.

05:53.686 --> 05:55.521
You know, it's good to see you too.

05:55.605 --> 05:58.733
And hey, listen,
I am sorry about prom night.

05:58.816 --> 06:00.485
About you getting eaten--

06:00.568 --> 06:02.236
After you stood me up?

06:03.029 --> 06:04.155
I stood you up?

06:04.238 --> 06:06.032
[bawling]

06:15.625 --> 06:17.543
Oh, no need to apologize.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.921
That was a long time ago, Julien.

06:20.004 --> 06:23.007
I mean, King Julien.

06:23.091 --> 06:28.471
Besides, I'm sure you had a really
good reason for standing me up.

06:28.805 --> 06:31.057
The tie's gotta be exactly right.

06:31.849 --> 06:34.310
This is prom, man! Do it again, Ted.

06:34.393 --> 06:35.895
Of course, Prince Julien.

06:36.687 --> 06:39.273
Oh, look at you, growing up so fast.

06:39.357 --> 06:41.150
You're gonna be prom king,

06:41.609 --> 06:45.613
and I'm gonna be alone, in the corner,
all alone forever.

06:46.322 --> 06:47.573
[crying]

06:47.657 --> 06:50.368
Ted, you got tears on my tie.

06:50.451 --> 06:52.203
Again. Not cool, man!

06:52.286 --> 06:54.288
Oh, golly, I'm so sorry, Your Majesty.

06:55.414 --> 06:59.418
You know, Karen,
all the time we dated in Lemur School,

07:20.314 --> 07:22.150
[gasps] They're playing our song!

07:24.277 --> 07:26.404
Remember the dance routine we created?

07:26.487 --> 07:27.530
Do I remember?

07:27.613 --> 07:30.116
I was in traction for, like, six weeks.

07:30.199 --> 07:31.284
I'll never forget.

08:04.025 --> 08:06.611
I'm keeping my eyes on you, Karl.

It's Gadget Rainlight out in front.

and Daddy's Combover coming on strong.

Aww, this is nice.

08:47.735 --> 08:49.904
Almost exactly the way I pictured it.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.615
Did you really mean it earlier?

08:52.698 --> 08:54.867
Can I see what's under the glove?

08:54.951 --> 08:57.411
Sure, silly. I'd love to show you.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.666
Whoa! Oh! Karen...

09:01.749 --> 09:04.210
[retches] I'm so sorry...

09:04.293 --> 09:05.836
I had no idea.

09:05.920 --> 09:10.007
Sometimes I glue a little hair on it
so I feel more normal.

09:11.008 --> 09:13.970
You are normal, Karen, mostly.

09:14.053 --> 09:16.055
You should probably
put the glove back on now.

09:19.600 --> 09:23.604
[narrator]  King Julien was the most
popular lemur in school. Loved by all.

09:23.938 --> 09:26.649
Ooh. A special tribute video to me.

09:26.732 --> 09:31.028
Or was he? The truth is,
everyone in King Julien's class

09:31.112 --> 09:33.864
was only nice to him
because he was the prince.

09:33.948 --> 09:36.200
No one will know it's me, right?

09:36.284 --> 09:39.412
[narrator]  King Julien's friends
were only pretending to be his friends

09:39.495 --> 09:41.622
because he was a prince and they had to.

09:41.706 --> 09:44.542
They pretended to laugh
at King Julien's jokes.

09:44.625 --> 09:48.462
And then I said,
but I don't even like lettuce.

09:48.546 --> 09:49.755
[laughs]

09:50.506 --> 09:52.300
-Hey!
-[laughs]

09:53.301 --> 09:55.761
[narrator]  They let Julien win everything.

09:55.845 --> 09:58.097
They let him win football games.

09:58.180 --> 09:59.432
[grunting]

10:02.643 --> 10:05.104
They let him win debate tournaments.

10:05.187 --> 10:08.482
And then I said,
but I don't even like lettuce.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.736
In rebuttal, I say to you, sir--

10:11.819 --> 10:13.154
[grunts]

10:14.614 --> 10:17.783
[narrator]  King Julien never created
the world's best milkshake,

10:17.867 --> 10:19.827
-it was actually poison.
-[choking]

10:20.911 --> 10:23.414
King Julien never made lemurs fly.

10:23.497 --> 10:24.582
[screams]

10:24.665 --> 10:26.375
Many never walked again.

10:28.336 --> 10:31.380
King Julien never separated
conjoined twins.

10:31.464 --> 10:34.675
He actually stitched us
together by mistake.

10:35.259 --> 10:37.637
And when Ted was voted prom king,

10:37.720 --> 10:40.765
he was forced to give up the crown
to King Julien.

10:42.308 --> 10:43.809
Okay, Karl.

10:44.393 --> 10:46.270
Ha-ha. Funny joke.

10:46.354 --> 10:48.606
You almost got me there for a second.

10:49.357 --> 10:52.068
-Karl?
-Sorry, King Julien. Karl's not here.

10:52.151 --> 10:54.487
He gave me the slip down the toilet.

10:54.570 --> 10:56.614
Everybody just go back to dancing now.

10:56.697 --> 10:59.742
[narrator] Even King Julien's
most trusted friend, Maurice,

10:59.825 --> 11:04.914
was paid to be Julien's friend
by none other than Uncle King Julien.

11:05.665 --> 11:06.791

11:06.874 --> 11:07.750

-On it!

11:16.634 --> 11:19.220
Were you paid to be my friend?

11:20.304 --> 11:21.305
[Mort giggles]

11:21.389 --> 11:24.725
Nobody ever paid me
to be your friend, King Julien.

11:24.809 --> 11:26.811
Quiet, Mort! You didn't even
go to our school!

11:28.145 --> 11:29.355
[Mort grunts]

11:30.147 --> 11:32.233
Well, Maurice? Is it true?

11:32.316 --> 11:34.693
King Julien, let me explain.

11:35.361 --> 11:38.489
It may have started as a job,
but it turned into real friendship.

11:38.572 --> 11:41.659
No! I don't want to hear
any more lies, Maurice.

11:41.992 --> 11:44.954
Am I even really a king?
Am I even a lemur?

11:45.037 --> 11:47.498
Or was I created in a lab somewhere?

11:47.581 --> 11:51.919
Some freak cyborg just now becoming
sentient. Whatever that means.

11:52.920 --> 11:55.548
My whole academic life has been a lie.

11:55.631 --> 11:59.552
I'm leaving now.
And nobody better follow me!

12:00.010 --> 12:01.387
[bawling]

12:01.971 --> 12:03.305
Hup-- Oh-- I--

12:03.389 --> 12:05.933
Why don't you let me
go talk to him, Maurice.

12:06.016 --> 12:08.978
Yeah, he probably doesn't
want to see me right now.

12:09.061 --> 12:11.105
[bawling]

12:11.188 --> 12:13.315
And now we're hugging. That's great.

12:13.441 --> 12:15.317
-Yeah. Hah.
-[continues bawling]

12:15.860 --> 12:16.944
Ted, handle this.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.738
There is no shame in crying.

12:19.822 --> 12:22.783
-I cry all the time. Just ask Dorothy.
-I want him...

12:22.867 --> 12:24.618
King Julien, wait!

12:26.954 --> 12:27.872
King Julien?

12:28.414 --> 12:29.707
[grunts]

12:33.711 --> 12:36.589
Really? No one followed me?

12:37.715 --> 12:41.760
I guess it's true.
They really don't love me.

12:42.011 --> 12:43.304
[sing-song] Chauncey!

12:43.888 --> 12:48.517
Come out, wherever you are.
It's time for us to celebrate.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.853
What are you celebrating, Karl?

12:50.936 --> 12:53.397
Could it be humiliating me,

12:53.481 --> 12:55.316
and proving that everyone
who ever loved me

12:55.399 --> 12:56.859
was only pretending to love me,

12:56.942 --> 13:00.029
thus destroying everything I am
or ever will be?

13:00.112 --> 13:02.865
I don't know what
you're talking about, Julien.

13:02.948 --> 13:04.909
Don't play dumb, Karl.

13:04.992 --> 13:07.286
I'm sorry I didn't notice
you in lemur school,

13:07.369 --> 13:09.914
but that's no reason
to make a video like that!

13:09.997 --> 13:11.332
That hurt, man.

13:11.415 --> 13:12.750
[laughs]

13:12.833 --> 13:14.919
A video? Please.

13:15.002 --> 13:16.378
I don't do videos.

13:16.462 --> 13:17.922
Far too simple for my tastes.

13:18.005 --> 13:22.218
Besides, I actually have to thank you,
Julien.

13:22.301 --> 13:25.012
If it weren't for you ignoring me,

13:25.095 --> 13:28.057
I never would have met my best friend.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.142
[cheering]

13:30.309 --> 13:32.186
[Karl crying]

13:32.269 --> 13:36.857
I just wish Julien would pay
attention to me!

13:36.941 --> 13:38.567
[crying]

13:39.818 --> 13:41.570
[gasps] Huh?

13:43.197 --> 13:44.031
Thank you.

13:44.114 --> 13:45.407
[squealing]

13:54.959 --> 13:56.877
[Karl] Chauncey.

13:59.505 --> 14:05.553
That was the beginning of a beautiful life
together, wasn't it, Chauncey?

14:09.265 --> 14:10.432
[growls]

14:10.516 --> 14:12.351
Let's go, Chauncey.

14:14.019 --> 14:17.481
Even Karl has his creepy cockroach friend,

14:17.565 --> 14:20.359
but I have no one.

14:20.442 --> 14:22.194
[Karen] Um, King Julien?

14:24.280 --> 14:26.240
Go away, Karen. [cries]

14:26.323 --> 14:29.243
I don't want to bother you,
but I thought you could use a friend.

14:29.326 --> 14:31.662
[scoffs] Didn't you hear?

14:31.745 --> 14:33.455
I don't have any friends.

14:33.539 --> 14:37.376
Besides, you were probably paid to be
my friend just like the rest of them.

14:37.459 --> 14:39.086
Oh, that's not true.

14:39.169 --> 14:41.130
Nobody had to pay me to be your friend.

14:41.213 --> 14:44.049
I always thought
you were the coolest, sweetest,

14:44.133 --> 14:46.176
most handsome lemur in our school.

14:46.260 --> 14:47.136
I still do.

14:48.762 --> 14:50.973
I know what'll make you feel better.

14:51.599 --> 14:52.808
[dance music playing]

14:52.892 --> 14:53.726
Hear that?

14:53.809 --> 14:56.270
No, Karen. I don't feel like dancing.

14:56.353 --> 14:58.314
But it's our song.

14:58.397 --> 15:00.816
You can't resist our song.

15:01.025 --> 15:02.526
Huh? Huh?

15:02.610 --> 15:04.278
Hmm. I'm not sure.

15:04.361 --> 15:06.030
But my booty is interested.

15:06.113 --> 15:06.947
[Karen] Come on.

15:18.709 --> 15:20.169
We've been walking for a while.

15:20.794 --> 15:21.670
[grunts]

15:22.546 --> 15:24.590
Do you know where we are?

15:24.673 --> 15:28.218
Hmm. Dunno. Probably some random
and totally insignificant

15:28.302 --> 15:29.136
part of the jungle?

15:29.219 --> 15:30.763
[sing-song] Wrong.

15:31.180 --> 15:35.684
This is the exact spot where we
were supposed to meet on prom night.

15:36.226 --> 15:38.062
Oh... Oh, yeah.

15:39.396 --> 15:40.397
[screams]

15:42.358 --> 15:47.488
Karen? I seem to have triggered
some sort of trap.

15:47.571 --> 15:48.864
Oh, no!

15:48.948 --> 15:51.825
I hope a foosa doesn't hear you
and try to eat you.

15:51.909 --> 15:54.328
Wait. Yes, I do.

15:54.453 --> 15:57.623
Ah, you! You made the video!

15:57.706 --> 16:00.250
That's right, Julien. It was me.

16:00.334 --> 16:02.753
I planned this entire reunion.

16:02.836 --> 16:06.298
All so I could humiliate you,
the way you humiliated me.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.801
What about all that stuff
you said earlier,

16:08.884 --> 16:11.428
about being my friend
and thinking I'm the coolest,

16:11.512 --> 16:13.389
sweetest, handsomest lemur ever?

16:13.472 --> 16:15.432
I lied. Didn't mean any of it.

16:15.516 --> 16:16.600
I was never your friend.

16:16.684 --> 16:19.895
I was just using you so that I could be
the most popular girl in school.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.397
So that I could be prom queen.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.983
And then marry you
and become Queen of Madagascar.

16:24.066 --> 16:27.277
And then destroy you
and become Queen of the World.

16:27.361 --> 16:28.946
And then, the Universe!

16:29.029 --> 16:30.489
But you ruined it!

16:30.656 --> 16:33.367
Help! Somebody help me! [screams]

16:33.450 --> 16:35.661
I've been trapped by a crazy lady!

16:35.744 --> 16:37.579
Oh, I'm not crazy, Julien.

16:37.663 --> 16:41.000
I'm angry. And now, I'm getting even.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.711
I'm going to leave you here
to be eaten by a foosa,

16:43.794 --> 16:47.256
just like you left me
when you stood me up on prom night.

16:48.257 --> 16:49.591
What are you doing?

16:49.675 --> 16:52.261
Prepare to be eaten, Julien.

16:52.344 --> 16:55.681
The foosa should be here any minute.

16:55.806 --> 16:56.640
[gasps]

16:56.724 --> 16:58.225
[blows whistle]

16:59.018 --> 17:00.227
[growling]

17:09.445 --> 17:11.321
Okay, Ted. That'll do.

17:11.405 --> 17:13.490
You don't have to play the hero with me.

17:13.574 --> 17:16.285
Let Ted in. Let Dr. Ted heal you.

17:16.368 --> 17:17.453
That'll do, Ted!

17:18.662 --> 17:21.331
Uh, Maurice? What do we do now?

17:21.415 --> 17:22.249
I don't know.

17:22.332 --> 17:25.711
I thought surely Clover could convince
King Julien to come back by now.

17:25.794 --> 17:27.880
[mumbling]

17:27.963 --> 17:32.051
Clover! We can't understand
what you're saying!

17:32.134 --> 17:34.386
There's a gag in your mouth!

17:35.137 --> 17:35.971
Give me that.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.514
What happened? Where's King Julien?

17:37.598 --> 17:39.475
Karen! This whole thing!

17:39.558 --> 17:41.310
It was... it was Karen!

17:41.393 --> 17:42.519
You like that?

17:42.603 --> 17:43.645
Wanna see it again?

17:43.729 --> 17:45.105
Oh. Actually it's not--

17:45.939 --> 17:48.567
Oh. How do you like the hand now, Julien?

17:48.650 --> 17:50.194
How do you like it now?

17:50.986 --> 17:52.696
Thumb wrestle? Patty-cake?

17:52.780 --> 17:54.364
No? Oh!

17:54.448 --> 17:56.283
What time is it? Can you see?

17:56.366 --> 17:58.410
Looks like two clumps of hair
past a freckle.

17:58.494 --> 17:59.578
Some hedge trimmers.

17:59.661 --> 18:01.622
Time for you to die!

18:04.458 --> 18:06.001
Here they come, Julien!

18:09.088 --> 18:10.964
-[grunts]
-[gasps]

18:12.966 --> 18:14.218
Let him go, Karen.

18:14.301 --> 18:15.385
Never!

18:15.469 --> 18:16.929
Oh, Clover.

18:17.137 --> 18:20.808
Thank Frank, you're here.
Also, what took so long?

18:20.891 --> 18:22.267
Don't worry, King Julien.

18:22.351 --> 18:23.352
You're safe now.

18:23.435 --> 18:24.520
[laughs]

18:24.603 --> 18:25.604
What are you going to do?

18:25.687 --> 18:28.774
Take on a whole pack of hungry foosa
single-handedly?

18:29.358 --> 18:30.818
I won't have to.

18:31.193 --> 18:32.277
Huh?

18:36.323 --> 18:40.160
No! Go away! I don't want your help!
You're all a bunch of phonies.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.454
You're probably only here because
someone's paying you to!

18:42.538 --> 18:43.831
No, King Julien!

18:43.914 --> 18:46.125
We're all here because we care about you.

18:46.208 --> 18:47.459
We love you!

18:47.584 --> 18:49.086
[crying]

18:49.169 --> 18:50.546
[Hector] I do not!

18:52.589 --> 18:55.509
Quit it with the sappy stuff, Maurice,
and get me down from here!

18:56.176 --> 18:57.469
[all cheering]

18:57.553 --> 18:59.012
We're doing this!

19:00.472 --> 19:02.599
We're all gonna fight!

19:05.811 --> 19:06.645
[roaring]

19:07.354 --> 19:09.106
[all scream]

19:09.189 --> 19:11.441
Run away!

19:11.525 --> 19:13.026
[all grunting]

19:15.946 --> 19:17.447
[laughing]

19:19.992 --> 19:21.451
[grunting]

19:21.952 --> 19:24.538
Your hand is freakishly strong.

19:24.621 --> 19:27.374
Too bad I can't say that
for the rest of...

19:27.916 --> 19:30.669
What happened to us girls
sticking together, Clover?

19:30.752 --> 19:33.172
We can't allow guys like Julien
to treat us this way!

19:33.255 --> 19:36.341
Listen, I admit, what King Julien did
was yeah, little bit wrong,

19:36.425 --> 19:37.718
but that's no reason to kill him!

19:41.722 --> 19:42.723
Mo-Mo.

19:44.641 --> 19:45.893
[screaming]

19:50.480 --> 19:53.025
[Karl] You can't kill King Julien!

19:54.526 --> 19:58.739
This has nothing to do with you,
guy with a cockroach for a best friend!

19:59.323 --> 20:02.993
This has everything to do with me!

20:03.076 --> 20:07.039
Julien and I are locked in an epic battle
of light and dark!

20:07.122 --> 20:10.167
He is my nemesis, and I am his.

20:10.250 --> 20:13.545
And I can't have you
and your pedestrian little

20:13.629 --> 20:17.382
"rope trap and a pack of foosa plan"

20:17.466 --> 20:18.842
get in the way of that!

20:19.134 --> 20:23.764
You see, Julien's fate belongs to me!

20:23.889 --> 20:24.806
Not you!

20:25.349 --> 20:26.350
Me!

20:29.061 --> 20:30.062
No!

20:30.145 --> 20:32.397
Don't run away.
You're supposed to eat King Julien.

20:32.481 --> 20:34.566
Eat him! Talk to the hand!

20:36.318 --> 20:37.152
[screams]

20:37.236 --> 20:38.445
[gasps] Karen!

20:41.615 --> 20:44.076
May she rest in peace.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.080
Thanks for coming to rescue me, everybody.

20:48.163 --> 20:51.625
I guess this means you really do love me.

20:51.708 --> 20:53.543
Of course we love you.

20:53.627 --> 20:54.795
[Hector] I do not.

20:55.545 --> 20:57.839
But I love you the most!

20:58.382 --> 21:00.842
Okay, Mort. Take the love down a notch.

21:01.051 --> 21:03.679
[Mort] You're my everything!

21:04.263 --> 21:06.932
And Karl? You came too.

21:07.015 --> 21:09.518
Does this mean we're... friends now?

21:09.601 --> 21:11.853
We're not friends. We are eternal enemies.

21:11.937 --> 21:14.982
And no one will have the pleasure
of destroying you

21:15.065 --> 21:16.650
except me.

21:16.733 --> 21:19.194
And trust me, I will destroy you.

21:19.278 --> 21:22.155
When you least expect it.

21:23.323 --> 21:24.157
[laughing]

21:24.241 --> 21:26.618
Well, okay then.

21:26.702 --> 21:27.619
Bye.

21:27.703 --> 21:28.787
[dance music playing]

21:28.870 --> 21:29.913
[all cheering]

21:33.583 --> 21:37.963
I'm sorry I never told you about the whole
"being hired to be your friend" thing.

21:38.046 --> 21:39.756
Aw, that's okay, Maurice.

21:39.840 --> 21:42.009
You'll always be my best friend.

21:42.092 --> 21:45.679
No matter what sordid details
about your past come to light.

21:45.762 --> 21:47.806
Don't get a big head
about it or anything.

21:47.889 --> 21:49.224
I won't, Your Majesty.

21:49.349 --> 21:52.144
Well, it looks like everything
turned out okay,

21:52.227 --> 21:54.062
and all is right with the world.

21:54.146 --> 21:56.481
All except for one thing.

21:57.482 --> 21:59.901
By the power vested in me,

21:59.985 --> 22:03.864
I now pronounce that our prom king is...

22:03.947 --> 22:04.781
Ted!

22:04.906 --> 22:06.616
[gasps] Really?

22:06.908 --> 22:09.619
[gasps] Oh, King Julien, are you sure?

22:10.287 --> 22:11.204
Yes, Ted.

22:11.330 --> 22:14.249
This is the way it should have been
all those years ago.

22:14.374 --> 22:15.334
[giggles]

22:16.126 --> 22:17.210
Oh, I...

22:17.294 --> 22:19.296
I'm so excited I just can't breathe!

22:19.379 --> 22:21.048
I just might joy tinkle.

22:21.131 --> 22:22.716
Oops. I already did.

22:22.799 --> 22:24.676
[all cheering]

22:25.719 --> 22:28.430
