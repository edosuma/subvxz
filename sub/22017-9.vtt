- We together, fool.

00:07.752 --> 00:09.229
It's time for y'all to know
what's going on around here.

So, what are you doing
in Ayanna's car?

00:23.034 --> 00:24.445
- She got me out of juvie.
- It's a Xanax.

00:24.469 --> 00:25.901
<i>You're making moves</i>

00:25.937 --> 00:27.281

09:13.303 --> 09:14.402
You're lucky.

09:14.438 --> 09:16.504
I mean, we ain't win yet.

09:16.540 --> 09:20.237
You got no idea how fly you
really are, Superstar.

09:32.325 --> 09:33.604
Hey.

09:34.016 --> 09:37.751
If we win the showcase
and we go on tour,

09:37.786 --> 09:39.519
I'm taking you with me.

09:39.555 --> 09:43.490
There's no reason for you to
be homeless when you got me.

09:45.427 --> 09:47.561
Hey, you can stay at the salon.

09:47.596 --> 09:49.429
Star told me that
it got shut down,

09:49.465 --> 09:52.365
and Miss Carlotta's gonna be
at the showcase anyway, so...

09:52.401 --> 09:53.733
You sure?

09:53.769 --> 09:55.969
Yeah. Yeah.

09:56.004 --> 09:58.738
Trust me, you'll be safe there.

10:04.928 --> 10:07.247
- It's right there.
- ♪ Ooh. ♪

10:07.282 --> 10:08.949
Yeah, but...

10:08.984 --> 10:11.952
No, it's good, but we can
make it hot if we want.

10:13.555 --> 10:15.856
I mean, why does
it really matter?

10:15.891 --> 10:17.657
It's not like we're
actually competing.

10:17.693 --> 10:18.925
I mean,

10:18.961 --> 10:21.027
maybe we give the people
a little surprise.

10:21.063 --> 10:23.129
You know, we always got
to do the unexpected.

10:23.165 --> 10:25.699
Something like this.

10:28.385 --> 10:30.070
This.

10:30.698 --> 10:32.198
Somebody is getting pregnant

10:32.210 --> 10:34.474
after y'all close the show.

10:34.510 --> 10:36.821
I see why you ain't answered my calls.
I've been blowing you up

10:36.845 --> 10:38.151
- all morning, girl.
- I'm sorry.

10:38.163 --> 10:40.277
Hey, I got to catch up
with Maurice right quick.

10:40.289 --> 10:41.448
I'll be right back?

10:41.483 --> 10:44.251
- All right.
- Yeah, okay.

10:44.286 --> 10:46.597
Bye.

10:46.609 --> 10:48.109
Spill it, bitch.

10:48.144 --> 10:49.677
When did the fake
become the real?

10:49.712 --> 10:51.612
I get it, though.

10:51.647 --> 10:53.871
- Noah is fine as hell, honey.
- Mm-mm.

10:54.029 --> 10:55.644
No. It's not real.

10:55.656 --> 10:57.384
You know who he reminds me of?

10:57.420 --> 10:59.019
Your sexy-ass daddy. Mm!

10:59.055 --> 11:00.888
Roland Crane. Ooh, child.

11:00.923 --> 11:04.191
What? I'm just keeping
it a hundred.

11:04.227 --> 11:06.093
Look, Noah kissed me once.

11:07.259 --> 11:10.598
Once, and it's never happening
again because I have a boyf...

11:10.633 --> 11:12.099
Wheelchair-rollin',

11:12.135 --> 11:13.868
cornrow-havin', power
to the people-vibin',

11:13.903 --> 11:16.063
sexy-ass boyfriend.

11:16.204 --> 11:18.405
- Exactly.
- Hmm.

11:18.441 --> 11:22.676
And, after tomorrow,
me and Noah are done.

11:23.682 --> 11:26.347
The lies. The lies we
tell ourselves, girl.

11:26.382 --> 11:28.482
Uh...

11:36.659 --> 11:39.693
Baby, I know you're still mad,
but I really want to talk.

11:41.998 --> 11:45.566
I know you're here, Elliot.
Your car's out front.

11:48.905 --> 11:50.471
Elliot.

11:51.797 --> 11:54.465
Baby... E-El...

11:55.259 --> 11:56.494
Oh.

12:00.461 --> 12:02.570
911. What's your emergency?

12:05.678 --> 12:08.841
We have a few buyers,
several media companies.

12:08.853 --> 12:11.153
Great offer... and cash.

12:11.189 --> 12:13.389
You won't want to sell after
you see the showcase.

12:13.424 --> 12:15.658
We're letting the public
decide the winner.

12:15.693 --> 12:17.059
It is PR gold.

12:17.095 --> 12:18.561
It's all speculation.

12:18.596 --> 12:20.429
I know what I'm doing. Trust me.

12:20.465 --> 12:21.864
We'll see.

12:21.899 --> 12:23.833
I believe in my artists.

12:23.868 --> 12:28.437
If we get two million social
media impressions off this show,

12:28.473 --> 12:31.273
I want you to back off and
let me complete my full year

12:31.309 --> 12:33.912
as the head of Midtown
like we agreed.

12:34.106 --> 12:36.178
- If not...
- I sell.

12:40.551 --> 12:44.614
Do you know why I go play poker
every Wednesday night, YaYa?

12:44.773 --> 12:46.689
It's because I never lose.

12:46.724 --> 12:48.224
Hey, you want to tell me

12:48.259 --> 12:50.426
what's going on with my singers?

12:51.720 --> 12:54.658
- Can't you see I'm busy?
- I don't care.

12:54.817 --> 12:56.458
Excuse me, Dad.

12:57.502 --> 12:59.735
Jahil, you know how
important this is for me.

12:59.771 --> 13:01.237
I am with my father.

13:01.272 --> 13:02.883
So, what, so you're gonna
allow this to happen?

13:02.907 --> 13:04.385
You're gonna let those
boys let go of me?

13:04.409 --> 13:06.742
I am <i> not</i> going to get
into their heads

13:06.778 --> 13:08.856
the night before the showcase.
What do you expect me to do?

13:08.880 --> 13:11.757
I guess nothing, which means you're a
bigger snake than I thought you were.

13:11.769 --> 13:15.574
I suggest you leave before I
have you escorted out of here.

13:16.368 --> 13:18.087
You better fix this.

13:21.920 --> 13:22.958
Thanks, Dad.

13:22.994 --> 13:24.493
What the hell's going on here?

13:24.529 --> 13:26.929
You can't have folks coming up
here, telling you what to do.

13:26.964 --> 13:31.000
The reason I had him leave
is because I'm loyal

13:31.035 --> 13:33.002

You-you killed Elliot.
