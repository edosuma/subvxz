WEBVTT

00:01.041 --> 00:02.203
Previously on Empire...

00:02.204 --> 00:03.222
Let your adoring fans know that

00:03.246 --> 00:04.306
the Trust Tour is over.

00:04.330 --> 00:06.930
After this next treatment,
you could be cancer-free.

00:06.931 --> 00:08.102
- Oh, my God!
- Thank God!

00:08.103 --> 00:10.648
I'm out $250K,
and I want it right now.

00:10.672 --> 00:12.450
I can sell it in a couple days
and get you your money.

00:12.474 --> 00:13.951
Nah. Kinda like it.

00:13.975 --> 00:15.953
You were there for me
when I needed, but this is over.

00:15.977 --> 00:18.956
I would like
to properly introduce Kingsley.

00:18.980 --> 00:20.491
Look, all y'all know
that we're getting married.

00:20.515 --> 00:22.193
But we want to get married
as soon as possible.

00:22.217 --> 00:25.129
Let's toast to Jamal and Kai!

00:25.153 --> 00:27.631
♪ It's all right, now we'll
never look back... ♪

00:27.655 --> 00:30.267
What's the secret to
the success of your marriage?

00:30.291 --> 00:32.625
I thought The New
York Times was profiling

00:32.627 --> 00:34.639
Jamal's wedding.

00:34.663 --> 00:36.526
And what does that have to do
with our marriage?

00:36.527 --> 00:40.774
Jamal said that your marriage is
the epitome of everlasting love.

00:40.798 --> 00:43.243
Well, Jamal's right.

00:43.267 --> 00:46.146
I mean, our marriage
is the emotional bedrock

00:46.170 --> 00:48.115
of this family.

00:48.139 --> 00:50.984
What does love mean to you?

00:51.008 --> 00:54.354
See, love is about respect.

00:54.378 --> 00:57.791
Actually, love is
what unites my family.

00:57.815 --> 01:01.495
Love for my music, for my brothers.

01:01.519 --> 01:04.498
Love for my children.

01:04.522 --> 01:07.334
Love never dies.

01:07.358 --> 01:10.470
Even when a loved one passes on,
their memory, their presence,

01:10.494 --> 01:12.639
we carry it with us.

01:12.663 --> 01:14.708
Whether we're aware of it or not.

01:14.732 --> 01:18.845
Uh, we are the sum
of all the love in our lives.

01:18.869 --> 01:22.983
Oh, man. What do I love most
about Jamal Lyon?

01:23.007 --> 01:24.885
Well, I don't know
if you can print this, but...

01:24.909 --> 01:26.887
Okay, see, no, stop. Come on.

01:26.911 --> 01:28.391
- But you know exactly what...
- Stop.

01:29.747 --> 01:33.727
We have a very real opportunity
to inspire the next generation,

01:33.751 --> 01:35.562
- so don't be messy.
- Okay.

01:35.586 --> 01:37.998
What would you like to say
to the next generation?

01:38.022 --> 01:40.133
Specifically, the...

01:40.157 --> 01:42.536
eight-year-old black boy
living in rural Missouri

01:42.560 --> 01:45.305
whose father beats him
for wearing a dress.

01:48.933 --> 01:51.345
- Walking in here looking like a little bitch.
- Okay!

01:51.369 --> 01:53.046
Please don't make me...

01:53.070 --> 01:56.049
What would you like to say to him?

01:58.776 --> 02:00.743
That he's loved.

02:02.013 --> 02:04.391
And he should be patient with himself.

02:04.415 --> 02:06.159
And his father.

02:06.183 --> 02:08.996
My father's issues
with my sexuality is no secret.

02:09.020 --> 02:11.031
But, uh, the way I see it is

02:11.055 --> 02:12.733
if the King of Hip-Hop can change,

02:12.757 --> 02:15.435
then there's hope for all fathers,

02:15.459 --> 02:16.870
for every son.

02:16.894 --> 02:18.739
One last thing.

02:18.763 --> 02:23.877
I received an anonymous e-mail
claiming that the wedding's off.

02:23.901 --> 02:26.446
That's ridiculous. Like, why the
hell would the wedding be off?

02:26.470 --> 02:28.181
The e-mail accuses Kai

02:28.205 --> 02:31.084
of hiding
his HIV-positive status from you

02:31.108 --> 02:33.720
and that you've been trying
to find a way

02:33.744 --> 02:36.056
to cancel the wedding because of it.

02:36.080 --> 02:38.558
Well, that's ridiculous.
That's absolutely not true.

02:38.582 --> 02:40.394
I've-I've always been
totally honest with Jamal.

02:40.418 --> 02:42.618
Do you have an official
statement for the record?

02:44.789 --> 02:50.699
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#FF0000"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#FF0000"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

02:51.796 --> 02:54.274
Hell are we supposed to do now?

02:54.298 --> 02:56.276
Whoever sent that e-mail to Stacey

02:56.300 --> 02:57.778
could've sent it anywhere.

02:57.802 --> 02:59.546
I mean, what if someone else
is already running the story?

02:59.570 --> 03:00.881
All right, well, then maybe
we need to get ahead of it,

03:00.905 --> 03:02.249
make our own statement.

03:02.273 --> 03:04.951
But then the whole conversation
becomes about me and my status,

03:04.975 --> 03:06.887
- which is nobody's business.
- Right, but if

03:06.911 --> 03:08.622
someone does put it out there,
then that's all

03:08.646 --> 03:09.956
everybody's gonna be
talking about anyway.

03:09.980 --> 03:12.092
Everybody, like, uh, your parents?

03:12.116 --> 03:13.427
Are you worried about
what they'll think

03:13.451 --> 03:15.062
this'll be for your career
and for-for Empire?

03:15.086 --> 03:17.064
Babe, you know I don't care
about stuff like that.

03:17.088 --> 03:18.832
I-I'm simply saying that
we should control the narrative.

03:18.856 --> 03:21.101
You mean control my narrative.

03:22.993 --> 03:25.639
Baby, I just don't want this to
derail our wedding. That's it.

03:25.663 --> 03:27.741
All right, look, we can't argue
about this right now.

03:27.765 --> 03:30.966
All right?
We're late for dinner. Come on.

03:38.476 --> 03:41.521
God, Mom,
everything just looks amazing.

03:41.545 --> 03:43.490
- Thank you.
- Mm, you think so?

03:43.514 --> 03:45.325
- You don't think I overdid it?
- Nah.

03:45.349 --> 03:47.127
I mean, you are my first

03:47.151 --> 03:49.463
that I will get to see get married,

03:49.487 --> 03:50.797
so everything has to be perfect.

03:50.821 --> 03:52.165
It is perfect.

03:52.189 --> 03:54.501
You ever think
you'd even see this day?

03:54.525 --> 03:56.770
I thought you'd be down on marriage,

03:56.794 --> 03:59.506
because of all of the things
me and your daddy been through.

03:59.530 --> 04:01.141
I mean, I wasn't always
rooting for y'all.

04:01.165 --> 04:03.343
But...

04:03.367 --> 04:05.345
But, I don't know,
I mean, it's like...

04:05.369 --> 04:07.814
God, now, y'all just right, you know?

04:07.838 --> 04:10.016
Like nothing in the world
could tear you apart.

04:10.040 --> 04:12.786
- Mm.
- And that's what I want for me and Kai.

04:12.810 --> 04:14.488
Hey. Mal.

04:14.512 --> 04:17.357
You better get your ass out here, man.

04:17.380 --> 04:19.692
Caterers tearing up my damn house.

04:19.716 --> 04:21.628
I don't even know half of them people.

04:21.652 --> 04:23.463
Thanks for everything, Dad.
I know it's

04:23.487 --> 04:25.465
a pain in the ass having all
these reporters in your face.

04:25.489 --> 04:27.134
You're welcome.

04:27.158 --> 04:28.969
These look good.

04:28.993 --> 04:31.371
- Mm-hmm. That's all. Just-just a couple.
- Um...

04:31.395 --> 04:33.206
I know that we rehearsed,

04:33.230 --> 04:35.075
you know,
the aisle walk with me and Mom.

04:35.099 --> 04:36.877
But I was thinking it'd be cool if...

04:36.901 --> 04:39.646
all three of us walked together,
you know, united.

04:39.670 --> 04:41.181
Wait, wait.

04:41.205 --> 04:43.517
Is this something
that that reporter suggested?

04:43.541 --> 04:45.752
No. I want this.

04:45.776 --> 04:47.754
It's important to me.

04:47.778 --> 04:49.923
Yeah, but the...
Walking down the aisle

04:49.947 --> 04:51.691
is what the father does
with the bride.

04:51.715 --> 04:53.493
I mean, that's the tradition.

04:53.517 --> 04:55.429
Y'all don't care about
tradition, or at least you said

04:55.453 --> 04:57.831
- you don't care about the tradition.
- I-I don't.

04:57.855 --> 04:59.699
So this shouldn't matter, then.

04:59.723 --> 05:01.768
But it does matter.

05:01.792 --> 05:03.870
It matters to me.
I want you by my side.

05:03.894 --> 05:06.273
Look, I-I just don't want
to be paraded around

05:06.297 --> 05:08.542
like I'm part
of somebody's agenda or nothing.

05:08.566 --> 05:10.210
- That's all.
- Uh... Lucious.

05:10.234 --> 05:12.913
That's what you think this is?

05:12.937 --> 05:14.848
I don't know.
I done did more interviews

05:14.872 --> 05:17.617
and photo shoots that people...
I don't even care to do.

05:17.641 --> 05:19.953
Yeah.

05:19.977 --> 05:21.955
No, seriously, Mal,
can't that be enough?

05:21.979 --> 05:24.079
Yeah, that's enough, Dad.
You did a lot. Thank you.

05:26.450 --> 05:28.951
You're a jackass.

05:30.000 --> 05:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:38.596 --> 05:40.373
Mm-mm.

05:42.666 --> 05:44.277
So, your always-reporting son

05:44.301 --> 05:46.279
tells me you're not a fan of my music.

05:46.303 --> 05:47.714
Oh, well, I wouldn't say that.

05:47.738 --> 05:49.115
One of my students cited

05:49.139 --> 05:51.840
"What the DJ Spins"
in his dissertation.

05:52.943 --> 05:54.287
You know how to put the listener

05:54.311 --> 05:55.388
right there in the Philly streets.

05:55.412 --> 05:56.923
Okay. I'm just messing with you.

05:56.947 --> 05:59.392
I like you, man.

05:59.416 --> 06:00.794
- That's where he gets that strength.
- Cheers.

06:00.818 --> 06:02.329
How you think they're doing?

06:02.353 --> 06:03.997
Our parents know
how to behave themselves.

06:04.021 --> 06:05.732
Yeah.

06:05.756 --> 06:10.136
Did, uh, Lucious say
he'd walk you down the aisle?

06:10.160 --> 06:13.673
This whole, like, wedding stuff
is just so much for him.

06:13.697 --> 06:15.108
Don't make excuses for him.

06:15.132 --> 06:17.532
Let's get champagne.

06:18.602 --> 06:20.146
Excuse me.

06:20.170 --> 06:22.182
Oh, Keem, we're about to head out.

06:22.206 --> 06:25.151
I want the kids to get some rest
and be fresh for tomorrow.

06:25.175 --> 06:26.987
What time should I be
at your crib tomorrow?

06:27.011 --> 06:28.421
Oh. We're gonna ride with Devon,

06:28.445 --> 06:30.857
so I'll just meet you at the church.

06:30.881 --> 06:32.292
What you mean, Devon?

06:32.316 --> 06:33.927
Y'all together?

06:33.951 --> 06:36.196
We're getting to know each other.

06:36.220 --> 06:37.497
Is that a problem?

06:37.521 --> 06:39.199
No.

06:39.223 --> 06:41.301
Great. Have you seen Bella?

06:41.325 --> 06:43.358
She in the room with Dre.

06:46.897 --> 06:48.608
Devon, huh?

06:51.068 --> 06:52.879
Game on.

06:52.903 --> 06:55.181
- And who's this?
- Her name is Piggy.

06:55.205 --> 06:56.616
She thinks you're pretty, Auntie Teri.

06:56.640 --> 06:58.652
- Aw. Thank you, Piggy.
- Aw.

06:58.676 --> 07:01.221
That is very sweet.

07:01.245 --> 07:03.456
Andre, baby, you need to eat.

07:03.480 --> 07:04.658
I already ate, Ma.

07:04.682 --> 07:06.159
I know, but I didn't see you, okay?

07:06.183 --> 07:07.794
- So go ahead on and eat this.
- No, no, no.

07:07.818 --> 07:09.496
- All right? Go ahead.
- Don't force-feed him.

07:09.520 --> 07:10.830
- Go ahead. You need to eat.
- Look, baby, you ain't got

07:10.854 --> 07:12.465
to stuff food down that boy's throat.

07:12.489 --> 07:14.467
I mean, he's fine.

07:14.491 --> 07:17.637
Is Bella okay?
Is she giving y'all any trouble?

07:17.661 --> 07:19.239
- Oh, no. No, no.
- No, no, no.

07:19.263 --> 07:23.076
She-she reminds me of my Quincy
when he was her age.

07:23.100 --> 07:25.579
You know, it's never too late
to start some new memories.

07:25.603 --> 07:26.746
Ma.

07:26.770 --> 07:27.814
Mm.

07:27.838 --> 07:30.717
No, it's all good. Um...

07:30.741 --> 07:33.486
Andre and I are taking things
one step at a time.

07:33.510 --> 07:35.488
Oh. Well, you can

07:35.512 --> 07:37.657
feel free to step right
on over to the altar

07:37.681 --> 07:39.492
- anytime soon.
- Okay, you are

07:39.516 --> 07:40.994
- officially cut off.
- What?

07:41.018 --> 07:42.996
- Andre, eat your food.
- Yes, ma'am.

07:43.020 --> 07:44.831
Give me my drink back.

07:44.855 --> 07:46.666
- I am so sorry.
- Oh.

07:46.690 --> 07:47.834
- It's fine.
- It's embarrassing.

07:47.858 --> 07:49.235
No.

07:51.295 --> 07:53.707
No, no, just get it done.

07:53.731 --> 07:56.576
Yeah. I'll call you back.

07:56.600 --> 07:59.579
Hey. Look, I hate to talk business,

07:59.603 --> 08:02.015
but the blogs are smelling
blood in the water.

08:02.039 --> 08:04.384
We can't keep using this wedding
to cover up

08:04.408 --> 08:06.586
for the fact that our tour is stalled.

08:06.610 --> 08:08.388
We need to make a statement.

08:08.412 --> 08:11.246
Yeah, well,
I'm already on top of that.

08:14.818 --> 08:17.063
Jamal, before I, uh...
before I forget,

08:17.087 --> 08:19.032
I didn't have time to get a gift.

08:19.056 --> 08:22.524
But, um... here's a little something.

08:25.496 --> 08:27.240
Wait a minute.

08:27.264 --> 08:29.909
That's my father's cuff links, Jamal.

08:29.933 --> 08:32.412
You never let those
out of your sight, Dre.

08:32.436 --> 08:33.780
Well, that's something
old, something new,

08:33.804 --> 08:35.548
something borrowed, something blue.

08:35.572 --> 08:37.583
That's everything. Bam.

08:37.607 --> 08:39.419
Dre, I don't know what to say.

08:39.443 --> 08:41.488
Cherish them as much as I did.

08:41.511 --> 08:42.756
Thank you.

08:42.780 --> 08:45.992
That's sweet. Mm.

08:46.016 --> 08:47.827
Mm, you all right over there?

08:47.851 --> 08:49.763
Nah, you need some water though.

08:49.787 --> 08:52.954
Excuse me.
A Mr. Damon Cross to see you.

08:56.360 --> 08:57.470
Apologies for the intrusion,

08:57.494 --> 08:59.272
but I have something
that belongs to you.

08:59.296 --> 09:00.674
My art broker found this.

09:02.633 --> 09:04.077
My broker said

09:04.101 --> 09:05.812
it was nowhere to be found.

09:05.836 --> 09:07.247
I just wanted to return it
to its rightful home.

09:07.271 --> 09:08.848
Lucious and Cookie, they deserve

Huh, Mom? Dad, that's-that's amazing.

09:15.312 --> 09:18.291
- Yeah. It's something.
- And speaking of love,

09:18.315 --> 09:20.093
Jamal, I-I think it's great
that, you know, you're putting

09:20.117 --> 09:21.828
your wedding out there
in front of the whole world

09:21.852 --> 09:24.097
for them to see it,
and that's what it's all about.

09:24.121 --> 09:25.532
When you find
that special person, you know,

09:25.556 --> 09:27.100
you shouldn't be all shy about it.

09:27.124 --> 09:29.669
I appreciate that, man. Thank you.

09:29.693 --> 09:31.938
This is late notice,
but what you doing tomorrow?

09:31.962 --> 09:33.506
You should just come to the wedding.

09:33.530 --> 09:35.442
- Oh, man...
- No, I'm sure Mr. Cross

09:35.466 --> 09:38.044
- got other plans.
- Yeah, and the seating chart is cut off.

09:38.068 --> 09:39.779
- It's too many people.
- I can... We ain't bringing nobody. Just...

09:39.803 --> 09:41.314
- It's too many people.
- I'd be honored.

09:41.338 --> 09:42.737
Thank you.

09:43.874 --> 09:45.618
I'll see you all tomorrow.

- before you invited him.
- I'm right here. I can hear you.

14:05.696 --> 14:07.574

you did didn't happen.

to all of us growing up.

14:20.945 --> 14:22.122
All right. Okay.

14:22.146 --> 14:23.990

how you know I'm a real Lyon?

14:33.557 --> 14:35.068
- You see that?
- Okay, let's...

14:35.092 --> 14:36.536
He's literally telling us
that there's a possibility

14:36.560 --> 14:38.104
- he could do this again.
- Come on, now, Kingsley.

14:38.128 --> 14:39.873
I invited you here to make peace.

14:39.897 --> 14:42.409
You're the oldest now.
That means you got to take up

14:42.433 --> 14:44.945

and have our backs.

What are you still doing up?

15:21.108 --> 15:22.753
Something about this painting

15:22.777 --> 15:26.823
and it being in Damon Cross's
possession don't add up to me.

15:26.847 --> 15:29.793
He didn't say nothing about this
when y'all was in Panama?

15:29.817 --> 15:33.163
Lucious, just be happy
we got the painting back, okay?

15:33.187 --> 15:35.687
I don't trust him.

15:36.690 --> 15:39.495
This is not about that painting.

15:39.496 --> 15:41.307
Or Damon.

15:41.331 --> 15:44.377
This is about what
Jamal asked you to do earlier.

15:44.401 --> 15:46.212
Nah, we worked that out.

15:46.236 --> 15:47.813
Oh, you did? You worked it out, huh?

15:47.837 --> 15:49.382

15:49.406 --> 15:52.685

when you told him no?

15:52.709 --> 15:54.720
Look, me going to the damn wedding

15:54.744 --> 15:56.355
is more than enough, Cookie.

15:56.379 --> 15:57.990
It's not enough, Lucious.

15:58.014 --> 16:01.327

the love of his life.

16:01.351 --> 16:03.329
Remember that feeling?

16:03.353 --> 16:06.198
And I know what it's like
to be shunned by your father

16:06.222 --> 16:08.701
- because of who you love.
- This ain't the same thing.

16:08.725 --> 16:10.803
- It's not the same. Hey, hey.
- This is a moral thing right now.

16:10.827 --> 16:13.205
Hey, Lucious, let me
just put it to you like this.

16:13.229 --> 16:15.808
You let my son down
way too many times.

16:15.832 --> 16:19.033
You do it this time,
we gon' have a problem.

16:25.875 --> 16:29.110
How the hell did he get
that damn painting?

16:36.519 --> 16:39.098
And I pledge to you, my beloved,
that we will stand together

16:39.122 --> 16:43.836
as living proof that love
can transform the world.

16:43.860 --> 16:45.838
It's cute.

16:45.862 --> 16:48.374
"Transform our world"?

16:48.398 --> 16:51.944

it's giving me Britney Spears

16:54.137 --> 16:56.415

17:02.612 --> 17:05.257
Of course you'll get it right.

17:05.281 --> 17:08.260
Honestly, I think you are
stressing about it too much.

17:08.284 --> 17:10.563
All you got to do is
get up there and talk to Kai

17:10.587 --> 17:13.398
like you're the only two people
in the entire world.

17:13.423 --> 17:14.767
It's that easy.

17:14.790 --> 17:17.403
- Oh.
- Is that a damn hickey on your chest?

17:17.426 --> 17:20.740
Okay, I'm a grown-up.
I don't get hickeys, okay?

17:20.763 --> 17:22.942
Is that from the stripper
you were thirsting at?

17:22.965 --> 17:25.711
Clearly he was thirsting at me.
You see this hickey!

17:25.734 --> 17:28.948
And on top of that,
I'm a grown woman, okay?

17:28.972 --> 17:30.082
I can do whatever I want.

17:30.106 --> 17:32.718
Okay, King B. Do you, boo.

17:32.742 --> 17:34.420
I will. I'll do some of him, too.

17:34.444 --> 17:36.422
I'm sure you will. You're nasty.

17:37.547 --> 17:39.458
Yeah, no, no, I'm headed out of the...

17:39.482 --> 17:40.826
getting to the garage right now.

17:40.850 --> 17:42.495
Just have security meet me down there.

17:42.519 --> 17:44.296
- I got my suit...
- Hey, hey, hey. Lucious, hey.

17:44.320 --> 17:46.732
Do you, uh, consider yourself
an ally to the LGBTQ community?

17:46.756 --> 17:48.401
And do you regret the use of gay slurs

17:48.425 --> 17:50.169
in your lyrics?

17:50.193 --> 17:52.438
I'm just trying to support my son

17:52.462 --> 17:55.741

agree with all his choices.

Come with us.

18:08.611 --> 18:10.456

I mean, unless you want Tiana
to think you have chlamydia.

18:18.888 --> 18:20.633
Look, I get it.
If you don't want to go

18:20.657 --> 18:23.202
to the wedding alone,
I mean, I'll go with you.

18:23.226 --> 18:24.670
What?

18:24.694 --> 18:26.205
I'm just being a friend.

18:26.229 --> 18:30.376
Besides... I make damn good arm candy.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.433
I'll see you here at 3:00.

18:35.405 --> 18:37.438
Don't be late.

18:42.078 --> 18:43.823
Look, lady,
how long is this gonna take?

18:43.847 --> 18:45.224
Are you anxious

18:45.248 --> 18:48.160
to get to the boy-on-boy nuptials?

18:48.184 --> 18:50.162
'Cause I can give you a lift.

18:50.186 --> 18:52.198
All the Lyons will be there, right?

18:52.222 --> 18:54.900
I can round them all up and then
ask them all some questions.

18:54.924 --> 18:57.236
God, that would be convenient for me.

18:57.260 --> 18:59.472
The bride wouldn't mind, right? Oh.

18:59.496 --> 19:01.807
I'm sorry. Which one is the bride?

19:01.831 --> 19:03.297
Your son?

19:05.335 --> 19:07.379
What do you want?

19:07.403 --> 19:09.248
Look, call Maya and find out

19:09.272 --> 19:11.050
where the hell she is with my orchids.

19:11.074 --> 19:13.352
And let her little ass know
I'm not playing with her.

19:13.376 --> 19:14.476
Mm-hmm.

19:16.045 --> 19:18.257
- Oh, okay, thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

19:19.782 --> 19:21.760
The hell are you doing here?

19:21.784 --> 19:23.863
Man, I don't get
a "Good afternoon, Damon.

19:23.887 --> 19:25.097
You look so Ni..."

19:25.121 --> 19:26.932
Hey. That's not funny.

19:26.956 --> 19:28.723
Come on. Come on!

19:32.852 --> 19:35.364
- Okay, why are you even here?
- I was invited.

19:35.388 --> 19:38.181
- I was supposed to say no?
- Yes. Yes, you were.

19:38.182 --> 19:39.659
You were supposed
to make something up.

19:39.683 --> 19:41.394
I don't know. And-and why the hell

19:41.418 --> 19:43.063
did you come to my house
with that painting?

19:43.087 --> 19:45.232
Did you have it all this time?

19:45.256 --> 19:47.334
What does it matter?
You broke it off, so...

19:47.358 --> 19:50.170
Okay. I'm-a need you
to stop saying that.

19:50.194 --> 19:53.006
Okay, there was nothing
to break off, all right?

19:53.030 --> 19:55.342
Then what was with the whole speech?

19:55.366 --> 19:57.377
You told me that
you didn't think it was right.

19:57.401 --> 19:59.446
Well, I don't think
there's anything more right.

19:59.470 --> 20:01.948
- I miss you.
- Okay.

20:01.972 --> 20:03.950
You can't be here.

20:03.974 --> 20:05.952
- Cookie.
- You need to leave.

20:05.976 --> 20:07.943
Leave.

20:18.055 --> 20:21.067
Jamal. Jamal!

20:21.091 --> 20:23.069
- Jamal, wait.
- Ma, what was that?

20:23.093 --> 20:25.538
- Nothing.
- Well, it looked like something.

20:27.665 --> 20:32.045
Okay, when Andre got sick,
I needed some support,

20:32.069 --> 20:34.981
and Damon just got
the wires crossed, that's all.

20:35.005 --> 20:37.117
- So, did you tell Dad?
- No.

20:37.141 --> 20:38.985
He wouldn't understand,
and you know that.

20:39.009 --> 20:40.820
So you've been sitting here,
lying to Dad all this time?

20:40.844 --> 20:42.255
- Mm.
- Mom, now, I-I know

20:42.279 --> 20:43.556
that y'all have had
your ups and downs,

20:43.580 --> 20:45.492
but you of all people
I expect to be better than that.

20:45.516 --> 20:47.627
I'm not going to sit here

20:47.651 --> 20:50.330
and pretend like
my marriage is perfect. Okay?

20:50.354 --> 20:52.399
- You are about to...
- Ma.

20:52.423 --> 20:54.734
Don't do that. Don't-don't-don't
tell me that I'll see.

20:54.758 --> 20:56.836
Don't wish that on me.

20:56.860 --> 20:58.994
Not today.

21:02.800 --> 21:05.245
Turn state's evidence
against Damon Cross,

21:05.269 --> 21:08.114
and you're free to go.
It's as simple as that.

21:08.138 --> 21:09.008
Who?

21:09.009 --> 21:12.182
His dirty Panama money
is all over Empire's books.

21:12.183 --> 21:14.293
Did you not think I'd know that?

21:14.294 --> 21:16.272
I run a multinational company.

21:16.296 --> 21:19.108
I have no idea
who half the investors are.

21:19.132 --> 21:21.778
If you're protecting him
out of some stupid, misguided

21:21.802 --> 21:23.646
thug code, don't. Because when I make

21:23.670 --> 21:26.983
the same offer to Cross, you're
gonna wish you'd played ball.

21:27.007 --> 21:29.752
I'm only coming to you first
out of courtesy

21:29.776 --> 21:32.622
because I hate to admit it...

21:32.646 --> 21:34.958
but I am a fan.

21:34.982 --> 21:37.360
Really?

21:37.384 --> 21:39.195
You're a fan?

21:39.219 --> 21:41.653
"Snitch Bitch" is my jam.

21:43.957 --> 21:45.935
You know,

21:45.959 --> 21:50.206
if you knew a tenth
of what you're asking me about,

21:50.230 --> 21:53.376
we wouldn't be having
this conversation, would we?

21:53.400 --> 21:55.845
You played a lot of games
with us when the White House

21:55.869 --> 21:58.715
had a little bit more melanin
in it, but today is a new day.

21:58.739 --> 22:01.951
And me shutting down your tour
for a week?

22:01.975 --> 22:04.676
Well, that's just my warm-up act.

22:06.346 --> 22:08.791
The whole time
you've been talking to me,

22:08.815 --> 22:12.662
I've been sitting here
thinking about my son,

22:12.686 --> 22:17.133
and how this is the most
important day for his life.

22:17.157 --> 22:19.469
And I'll be damned if I'm-a allow you

22:19.493 --> 22:21.504
or anybody else to ruin that.

22:21.528 --> 22:25.008
So, if you got plans on
coming to my son's wedding,

22:25.032 --> 22:27.677
and you like "Snitch Bitch,"

22:27.701 --> 22:30.201
you should give a listen
to "I Shot a Fed."

22:31.571 --> 22:32.937
A couple of times.

22:38.712 --> 22:40.189
I can't believe this.

22:40.213 --> 22:43.426
- He's a half hour late.
- I'm sure he's on his way, baby.

22:43.450 --> 22:45.094
Mom, you don't know that.
You know, I shouldn't have even

22:45.118 --> 22:46.562
asked him to walk me down
the aisle. I should've known

22:46.586 --> 22:48.231
that that's something
that would trigger him.

22:48.255 --> 22:50.266
Look, I know that you are in
your feelings right now, baby,

22:50.290 --> 22:51.934
but those are just nerves, okay?

22:51.958 --> 22:53.836
Mommy, I'm not nervous, okay?
I'm angry.

22:53.860 --> 22:56.572
And I'm not some little boy
that he threw in the trash.

22:56.596 --> 22:58.408
I'm a grown man, and I'm pissed off.

22:58.432 --> 22:59.842
I'm mad,
and I'm disappointed at the fact

22:59.866 --> 23:01.277
that he's not the man
I thought he was.

23:01.301 --> 23:02.545
Just give him a chance, all right?

23:02.569 --> 23:03.846
Let me call him again.

23:03.870 --> 23:06.382
There he is.
Where the hell have you been?

23:06.406 --> 23:08.084
Feds picked me up.

23:08.108 --> 23:10.386
- What?!
- Wouldn't even let me make a call.

23:10.410 --> 23:12.188
None of that matters. What matters is

23:12.212 --> 23:15.947
I almost missed the chance
to walk my son down the aisle.

23:17.651 --> 23:19.729
I thought, um...

23:19.753 --> 23:22.432
I thought I-I made a mistake
asking you.

23:24.124 --> 23:25.468
I don't know what I thought.

23:25.492 --> 23:27.525
You thought I was ashamed of you.

23:28.829 --> 23:31.095
I'm ashamed of me.

23:32.099 --> 23:34.043
Look, I still can't make

23:34.067 --> 23:36.379
heads or tails of none of this stuff,

23:36.403 --> 23:38.114
but none of that matters.

23:38.138 --> 23:41.873
What matters is that...
you are my son.

23:44.277 --> 23:47.890
And there's been so much hurt
between us, I'm...

23:47.914 --> 23:50.960
I don't want to cause no more,
so let's get you married, okay?

23:50.984 --> 23:53.096
- Yeah.
- He has to hurry up. Let's go.

23:53.120 --> 23:55.153

26:18.670 --> 26:20.181
At our wedding, y'all.

26:20.205 --> 26:21.750
- Come on, now.
- Thank you.

26:21.774 --> 26:24.252
- Oh, God bless you.
- God bless you.

26:24.276 --> 26:26.221
- I love you both.
- Love you.

26:34.586 --> 26:35.864
Oh.

26:35.888 --> 26:37.432
Oh, I am blessed.

26:37.456 --> 26:41.036
We all are, because we're here.

26:41.060 --> 26:44.706
And we're here because of love.

26:44.730 --> 26:46.341
Now, before we get into this,

26:46.365 --> 26:48.943
if anyone here can show just cause

26:48.967 --> 26:51.212
as to why these two
should not get married,

26:51.236 --> 26:52.956
you better sit down
and eat your rice, okay?

26:53.697 --> 26:55.617
'Cause we are making
history in this bitch...

26:55.641 --> 26:57.719
- Uh, oh-oh-oh. Church, Becky.
- What?

26:57.743 --> 26:59.387
- In this piece.
- Oh.

26:59.411 --> 27:01.289
Sorry. Um...

27:01.313 --> 27:03.391
Kai?

27:06.318 --> 27:08.063
Jamal,

27:08.087 --> 27:11.766
first you were the gorgeous man

27:11.790 --> 27:15.937
who I saved from a creeper
at a bar in London.

27:15.961 --> 27:18.540
Then you were the conceited man

27:18.564 --> 27:21.376
who was bragging in a studio
on our first date.

27:21.400 --> 27:22.880
- Uh, and obviously it worked.
- Okay.

27:27.473 --> 27:29.606
But you are so much more than that.

27:31.443 --> 27:34.622
You're the compassionate man...

27:34.646 --> 27:36.980
who loves me for who I am.

27:39.751 --> 27:43.465
The considerate man
who still finds time to call me,

27:43.489 --> 27:46.723
even when there are
ten time zones between us.

27:49.428 --> 27:53.274
And the patient man
who will stand beside me

27:53.298 --> 27:55.465
no matter what the world throws at us.

27:57.269 --> 27:59.981
You are my everything.

28:00.005 --> 28:03.451
And I love you so much.

28:03.475 --> 28:05.520
I love you.

28:07.379 --> 28:09.090
Jamal?

28:09.114 --> 28:11.314
Uh...

28:19.491 --> 28:20.924
Um...

28:23.228 --> 28:25.840
- I'm sorry. I can't do this.
- Mal?

28:33.305 --> 28:35.550
- Jamal.
- Everybody, calm down.

28:38.477 --> 28:40.488
I can't...

28:40.512 --> 28:44.058
recite some cookie-cutter vows
about love and marriage

28:44.082 --> 28:46.127
because...

28:46.151 --> 28:49.419
'cause I know in my heart that
love and marriage are messy.

28:51.823 --> 28:54.224
More messy than
I wanted to admit before.

28:57.696 --> 29:00.096
But that's what makes it real.

29:01.700 --> 29:04.245
Kai, I don't want
a fairy tale with you.

29:04.269 --> 29:08.071
I want something real,
something that endures.

29:10.075 --> 29:11.586
Like what our parents have.

29:11.610 --> 29:13.188
I don't know about the Givens,

29:13.212 --> 29:14.822
but maybe a little bit less drama

29:14.846 --> 29:16.824
than the Lyons have had.

29:16.848 --> 29:17.981
Oh, man.

29:20.219 --> 29:22.497
But here's what I can promise.

29:22.521 --> 29:24.554
I promise that I'm-a be...

29:26.525 --> 29:28.102
30% messy...

29:29.895 --> 29:32.128
...if you will, too.

29:33.131 --> 29:35.043
I will.

29:35.067 --> 29:37.045
I promise that I'll forgive you

29:37.069 --> 29:39.514
as much as I ask for forgiveness,

29:39.538 --> 29:42.050
if you will, too.

29:42.074 --> 29:43.551
I will.

29:43.575 --> 29:48.122
And most importantly,
Kai, I'm-a hold you every day.

29:48.146 --> 29:50.725
And I'm-a be with you.

29:50.749 --> 29:56.319
And I will love you forever,
if you will, too.

29:57.322 --> 29:59.200
I will.

29:59.224 --> 30:01.536
Seems like we're married.

30:01.560 --> 30:03.738
Okay. Hold on.

30:03.762 --> 30:06.074
I will tell you when you are married.

30:07.833 --> 30:10.533
- Exchange rings.
- Oh. Uh...

30:21.446 --> 30:26.294
Well, by the power vested in me
by the Universal Life Church,

30:26.318 --> 30:30.987
I now pronounce you...
husband and husband.

30:34.293 --> 30:36.137

It was tough. I'm not gonna lie.

37:33.637 --> 37:35.482
But Andre had my back.

37:35.506 --> 37:37.384
He told me how important it was to him

37:37.408 --> 37:40.487
that I take on the mantle
now that I'm the oldest.

37:40.511 --> 37:42.556

um, when I brought up the future,

38:24.889 --> 38:27.167
you kind of hesitated.

Now, I know I shouldn't
have put you on the spot,

38:30.027 --> 38:33.328
but I feel like there's
something you're not saying.

38:34.598 --> 38:37.344
Look, Andre has a new lease on life,

38:37.368 --> 38:40.046

- Well, does Andre know?
- No.

39:21.912 --> 39:25.681
No, and, Cookie, please,
don't tell him. He can't know.

39:38.028 --> 39:40.273
Damn, man, there you go.

39:40.297 --> 39:42.309
Why you hiding out up here?

39:42.333 --> 39:44.911
Um, just, uh...

39:44.935 --> 39:46.646
had a headache, Pop, that's all.

39:46.670 --> 39:49.249
You know, I needed some quiet.

39:49.273 --> 39:52.819

drinking y'all did last night.

something special.

40:12.663 --> 40:15.842

40:15.866 --> 40:17.844
I was talking to Kingsley.

40:17.868 --> 40:19.980

40:20.004 --> 40:23.116
about y'all conversation
last night about

40:23.140 --> 40:26.953
you passing on the mantle to him

40:26.977 --> 40:31.858
when you've always been
the rock of our family.

And it's like you're trying
to pass the baton on.

40:36.086 --> 40:39.966

that you're not telling me?

40:39.990 --> 40:41.890
No.

40:51.502 --> 40:53.213
I wasn't gonna say anything, Pop.

40:53.237 --> 40:55.215
I swear, I wasn't gonna say anything.

40:55.239 --> 40:58.018
You know, it's not my day.

41:03.213 --> 41:06.359

41:06.383 --> 41:07.761
No, you're not.

41:07.785 --> 41:09.696

41:09.720 --> 41:12.866
that the cancer was now under control.

41:12.890 --> 41:15.502
It is under control.

41:15.526 --> 41:17.270
The chemo drugs I took

41:17.294 --> 41:19.272
to fight the cancer
destroyed my heart muscle.

41:19.296 --> 41:22.375
The doctors just confirmed it.

41:22.399 --> 41:24.578
They're saying it's irreversible.

41:24.602 --> 41:28.448
No. There's nothing
that's irreversible.

41:28.472 --> 41:32.385
They said that the cancer
could not be beat.

41:32.409 --> 41:33.887
We beat that.

41:33.911 --> 41:37.057
I'm not gonna beat it, Pop.

41:37.081 --> 41:39.192
Not this time.

41:39.216 --> 41:41.394
I need a new heart.

41:41.418 --> 41:43.396

I took to kill the lymphoma.

42:14.918 --> 42:17.330

42:17.354 --> 42:19.766

42:19.790 --> 42:22.224

42:24.995 --> 42:27.273

42:54.324 --> 42:56.770
I'm not giving up.

42:56.794 --> 42:59.305
Pop, I've decided.

42:59.329 --> 43:04.377
I want to die the way
I should have lived.
