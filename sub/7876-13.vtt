00:28.357 --> 00:30.497
Synchro: mpm

00:35.568 --> 00:38.037
Okay, Debs, check out
that couple over there.

00:41.112 --> 00:42.742
Wait, that wasn't me!

00:42.867 --> 00:44.167
I would never...

00:47.409 --> 00:48.856
How great is this thing?

00:48.981 --> 00:50.854
It throws farts up
to a hundred yards!

00:50.979 --> 00:53.067
Well, if it makes you happy.

00:53.192 --> 00:54.094
So happy.

00:54.219 --> 00:57.327
It has a two-gig fart library
that analyzes your laughter

00:57.452 --> 01:00.330
and recommends farts based
on your comedic sensibility.

01:00.455 --> 01:01.655
<i>You enjoyed...</i>

01:02.642 --> 01:04.019
<i>Perhaps you'll enjoy...</i>

01:04.798 --> 01:05.942
Oh, that is nice!

01:06.067 --> 01:07.395
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Snot.

01:07.520 --> 01:09.694
You know Etan,
my bar mitzvah study buddy.

01:09.862 --> 01:12.334
Okay, Bubbie Judy, I'm just coming
to the end of the stairs now.

01:12.459 --> 01:14.068
The motor stairs.
That's right.

01:14.193 --> 01:17.123
I'm almost at the bottom, so I got to
get off, okay? I got to keep going.

01:17.248 --> 01:18.911
I know. I love you, too.
I have to go.

01:19.080 --> 01:20.369
Bye, Bubbie Judy.

01:20.494 --> 01:22.011
That was my grandmother.

01:22.136 --> 01:25.485
I call her every day, not because
I have to, because I want to.

01:25.610 --> 01:26.807
You should too.

01:26.932 --> 01:28.382
<i>Shaloms</i> all around.

01:28.793 --> 01:31.665
And, Debbie, a super <i>shalom</i> to you.

01:31.790 --> 01:34.185
I didn't see you at temple
this year for <i>Yom Kippur</i>.

01:34.310 --> 01:36.530
You missed
some off-the hizzy atonements.

01:36.655 --> 01:37.716
You were busy?

01:37.841 --> 01:41.017
Actually, I've sort of moved away
from traditional religion.

01:42.328 --> 01:43.930
Then might I suggest you check out

01:44.055 --> 01:46.796
the Jewish mystical
tradition of <i>Kabbalah</i> ?

01:47.003 --> 01:48.399
It's your Judaism...

01:48.900 --> 01:50.259
after dark.

01:50.883 --> 01:53.483
I didn't know you were
so spiritual, Etan.

01:53.629 --> 01:55.250
Hey, I'm spiritual, too!

01:55.375 --> 01:57.185
I'm terrified of ghosts.

01:57.310 --> 01:59.774
Well, I got to go shave.
It's been a couple of days.

01:59.899 --> 02:01.843
But I'll catch you later, nerds.

02:02.741 --> 02:05.571
I like my women
like I like my dreidels:

02:05.923 --> 02:07.050
bottom-heavy.

02:07.175 --> 02:09.043
I'll be blunt:
I'm coming on to you, Deborah.

02:09.168 --> 02:10.975
It's true.
This is what's happening.

02:11.100 --> 02:13.444
The <i>matzoh</i> ball's in your court.

02:15.756 --> 02:16.756
He's so...

02:17.464 --> 02:18.340
mature.

02:18.465 --> 02:19.465
I'm mature.

02:19.590 --> 02:20.708
<i>You enjoyed...</i>

02:21.623 --> 02:23.273
<i>Perhaps you'll enjoy...</i>

02:24.575 --> 02:27.229
He's right. I did enjoy that.
Very much so.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.840
Has anyone seen my cell phone?

02:35.322 --> 02:38.699
Why don't you call yourself from
the land line and listen for the ring?

02:38.867 --> 02:41.555
Because it's still on vibrate
from the movies last night.

02:41.734 --> 02:45.372
Why did I take consideration
for others into account? Why?!

02:47.167 --> 02:48.367
Yes! Found it!

02:48.492 --> 02:50.101
Wait, this isn't my phone.

02:50.226 --> 02:51.504
It's not even real.

02:51.672 --> 02:54.781
It's my phone, and it's full of jelly
beans, and they are my jelly beans.

02:56.136 --> 02:58.469
It's a green jelly bean.
I'm not gonna take this.

02:58.716 --> 03:00.679
Damn it!
I'll never find my phone.

03:00.896 --> 03:02.756
You know, they should invent a way

03:02.881 --> 03:05.717
so that if you lose your cell phone
on vibrate mode

03:05.842 --> 03:09.146
you can call it, enter a code,
and the phone rings.

03:09.569 --> 03:12.483
That... is a great idea.

03:12.927 --> 03:15.330
That's a million-dollar idea,
and we're gonna sell it!

03:15.455 --> 03:18.338
What? You're having a laugh at me.

03:18.463 --> 03:21.663
Francine, you know I only laugh
at <i>Two and a Half Men</i>.

03:23.081 --> 03:26.670
Charlie Sheen sleeps with whores,
then has breakfast with a fat child.

03:26.795 --> 03:28.290
It's funny just talking about it.

03:31.270 --> 03:33.879
Well, Snot, that is
the superball conundrum.

03:34.004 --> 03:37.523
We want them to bounce higher
and higher, but we risk losing them.

03:37.952 --> 03:39.426
What in the world is this?

03:43.704 --> 03:44.549
Cool!

03:44.674 --> 03:47.374
High-tech invitations
to Etan's bar mitzvah!

03:48.395 --> 03:50.537
He's rented out
the fanciest ballroom in town.

03:50.662 --> 03:52.422
Dang! For my bar mitzvah,

03:52.547 --> 03:56.293
I have to get to the park by dawn
to get the picnic table by the swings.

03:56.418 --> 04:00.022
It's the only one that doesn't have
a swastika or a boner carved in it.

04:00.147 --> 04:02.116
Wait. Where'smyinvitation?

04:04.079 --> 04:05.702
Etan's talking to Debbie.

04:05.827 --> 04:08.011
I wonder if he's inviting us
as a couple.

04:08.136 --> 04:11.236
No need to wonder, Steve,
I just loaded up my question gun.

04:11.361 --> 04:12.918
Time to go answer-hunting.

04:13.564 --> 04:15.338
Hey, Etan, just making sure that...

04:15.767 --> 04:17.325
Excuse me a moment.

04:21.224 --> 04:23.921
Good stuff, good stuff.
Now, where was I?

04:24.404 --> 04:26.293
Etan, can you give us a minute?

04:26.418 --> 04:29.540
Sure. I got to go set up
my gift registry anyway.

04:29.665 --> 04:33.328
I'm registering at Neiman Marcus...
or should I say, Needless Markup.

04:37.540 --> 04:38.937
That's high-brow.

04:40.085 --> 04:41.972
Steve, I'm sorry, but...

04:42.329 --> 04:46.324
well, Etan asked me to be his date
to his bar mitzvah, and I said yes.

04:46.626 --> 04:49.570
What?! You're dumping me
for that snobby rich kid?

04:49.695 --> 04:51.627
Steve, I don't care that he's rich.

04:51.752 --> 04:53.438
I care that he's mature.

04:53.563 --> 04:55.563
I'm sorry, but I need a man...

04:56.058 --> 04:57.058
not a boy.

04:57.964 --> 04:58.972
A boy?

04:59.179 --> 05:01.925
Could a boy produce tears this big?

05:06.371 --> 05:08.717
She thinks Etan's
more of a man than me.

05:09.929 --> 05:13.218
You know what I think? I think
a man doesn't sit around pouting.

05:13.343 --> 05:15.214
A man doesn't get sad, Steve.

05:15.339 --> 05:17.081
- A man gets...
- Even!

05:17.238 --> 05:19.362
I was gonna say
a chocolate lab puppy.

05:19.487 --> 05:21.330
I'm already sick of it.
Can you walk it?

05:21.455 --> 05:23.452
There's no reason
you can't walk it and get even.

05:23.577 --> 05:24.803
Wait, I know.

05:25.074 --> 05:28.069
Etan cares about his bar mitzvah
more than anything, right?

05:28.194 --> 05:30.128
And what do kids get
for bar mitzvahs?

05:30.341 --> 05:32.072
Gifts, and lots of 'em.

05:32.437 --> 05:33.531
Say no more!

05:34.624 --> 05:38.118
Okay, say more. I don't... I actually
don't know where this is going.

05:38.243 --> 05:42.422
Etan took what was precious to me, so
I'm gonna take what's precious to him.

05:42.547 --> 05:46.360
That's right: I'm gonna rob
Etan Cohen's bar mitzvah!

05:47.347 --> 05:50.658
{TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES
PLEASE HANG AROUND!}

05:57.916 --> 06:00.185
Etan took what was precious to me,

06:00.310 --> 06:03.752
so now I'm going to take
what's precious... to him.

06:08.623 --> 06:12.442
Are you going to achieve that
by robbing...

06:12.747 --> 06:16.421
- Etan Cohen's bar mitzvah.
- Okay, we got it.

06:18.117 --> 06:19.986
Great job, everyone, great job.

06:20.111 --> 06:23.511
I just get paid the most by far,
but you all make it work.

06:29.500 --> 06:31.606
All right, Roger,
I finished my research

06:31.731 --> 06:34.792
and devised the perfect plan to rob
Etan Cohen's bar mitzvah.

06:35.033 --> 06:38.499
And once Debbie sees him freak out
over losing his precious gifts,

06:38.624 --> 06:40.711
she'll realize
that he'sthe little boy.

06:40.836 --> 06:43.833
She'll be so turned off,
she'll come running back to me.

06:43.958 --> 06:46.703
The fat one? You're still trying
to win back the fat one?

06:46.828 --> 06:49.561
Right. Now, I analyzed
blueprints of the ballroom

06:49.686 --> 06:53.954
and watched every heist movie from
the Apple Dumpling Gang to <i>Oceans 12</i>.

06:54.378 --> 06:57.308
I know. Don't even get me started
on the whole Julia-Roberts-

06:57.433 --> 06:58.868
playing-Julia-Roberts thing.

06:58.993 --> 07:01.118
It wasn't even a little wink
to the audience.

07:01.243 --> 07:03.553
- It was a huge plot point.
- I know!

07:03.737 --> 07:05.796
Anyway, the planning stage is over.

07:06.084 --> 07:08.417
- Time to assemble my crew.
- I'm in.

07:08.542 --> 07:12.119
Sorry, but my plan requires
a crack squad of professionals,

07:12.244 --> 07:14.034
starting with a getaway driver.

07:14.159 --> 07:16.340
A wheelman?
I know the perfect guy:

07:16.465 --> 07:17.865
Lucius Mayweather.

07:18.638 --> 07:21.148
<i>He hustles eight-ball out of a bar
in East Langley.</i>

07:26.530 --> 07:27.905
Are you Lucius Mayweather?

07:28.218 --> 07:30.491
- Who wants to know?
- Roger? What the hell?

07:31.128 --> 07:33.059
Roger? No, Lucius.

07:33.439 --> 07:36.288
You must be the white boy
looking for a wheelman. I'm in.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.762
For God's sakes,
I'm assembling my own crew.

07:39.495 --> 07:42.412
That cracker's got a crack in his head,
if you ask me.

07:46.168 --> 07:47.718
You hustling me, boy?

07:48.009 --> 07:49.959
<i>In order for my plan to work,</i>

07:50.137 --> 07:52.214
<i>I need the world's greatest
computer hacker,</i>

07:52.339 --> 07:54.140
<i>the world's best demolitions expert,</i>

07:54.265 --> 07:56.683
<i>and the world's most flexible
contortionist.</i>

07:56.967 --> 07:59.519
Unfortunately, I wouldn't know
how to begin to get a hold of them.

07:59.774 --> 08:01.207
Which leaves me with you 3.

08:01.332 --> 08:03.732
Barry, Toshi,
you know my Uncle Roger.

08:04.163 --> 08:06.610
{Yes, the alien in a wig}

08:06.859 --> 08:10.130
- Yeah, on my mom's side.
- Wait, why isn't Snot here?

08:10.255 --> 08:12.699
Snot's too close to Etan.
He'd never betray him.

08:12.964 --> 08:14.217
But don't worry,

08:14.342 --> 08:17.371
Snot will have a role to play
before this is over.

08:19.088 --> 08:20.958
Okay, this is the layout
of the ballroom.

08:21.237 --> 08:23.627
And this is where
Etan's gift table will be.

08:23.796 --> 08:26.047
Roger, your job will be to tell Etan

08:26.172 --> 08:27.915
that someone's trying
to steal his gifts.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.940
- That's crazy!
- Trust me,

08:30.219 --> 08:33.303
Trust me, this plan has more twists
and turns than Lombard Street.

08:35.402 --> 08:37.273
You know, from San Francisco?

08:40.457 --> 08:41.687
Yeah, I been there.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.013
Now, Roger, you'll be posing
as a waiter.

08:44.138 --> 08:46.260
A waiter? <i>Cliché</i>!

08:46.385 --> 08:49.736
No, I'll be Ernest Shlumpel,
Etan's long-lost great uncle.

08:50.006 --> 08:52.910
When the Nazis annexed
Alsace-Lorraine in 1940,

08:53.035 --> 08:55.837
Ernest fled to Mykonos
where he invented a kosher lubricant

08:55.962 --> 08:58.580
- that tastes like whitefish salad...
- You're playing a waiter.

08:58.705 --> 09:01.548
But I've been developing
my Alsace-Lorraine Mykonos accent.

09:01.673 --> 09:03.922
- You're not doing an accent.
- Oh, yeah?

09:07.017 --> 09:08.922
You son of a bitch,
you know I'm not a fighter.

09:12.096 --> 09:13.905
- What are you doing?
- Practicing stirring.

09:14.030 --> 09:16.228
Well, you better start practicing
your cell phone pitch,

09:16.353 --> 09:19.370
because next week we have
a meeting with Global Mobile!

09:19.495 --> 09:21.017
My God, it's happening.

09:21.142 --> 09:23.812
- It's really happening!
- It's happening, all right.

09:24.133 --> 09:26.198
Unlike that catchphrase
I tried to start.

09:26.508 --> 09:28.238
"Nuh-uh to your uh-huh!"

09:30.337 --> 09:32.053
I'm a fan.

09:35.861 --> 09:38.911
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, goys and girls,
Etan Cohen welcomes you to...</i>

09:41.689 --> 09:42.689
<i>Maturity!</i>

09:50.744 --> 09:53.094
Welcome!
Drop your gifts on the gift table

09:53.219 --> 09:54.966
and your pants on the dance floor.

09:55.091 --> 09:57.040
I'm talking to you, Aunt Rose.

09:57.493 --> 09:58.764
Have fun, everyone!

10:03.330 --> 10:06.647
- Steve, what are you doing here?
- I'm Barry's "plus one".

10:06.815 --> 10:08.341
<i>Mazel tov</i>, Etan.

10:08.466 --> 10:09.652
Thanks, Bubbie Judy.

10:09.777 --> 10:11.985
So glad you could make it.
Special day for us all.

10:12.211 --> 10:15.144
Stick around,
I'm happy to share a little bit of...

10:15.269 --> 10:16.391
maturity with you.

10:16.516 --> 10:19.125
Come on, Barry.
Let's go drop off your gift.

10:21.658 --> 10:24.005
This is gonna put
my bar mitzvah to shame.

10:24.130 --> 10:26.191
The only decorations I have
are the police tape

10:26.316 --> 10:28.134
left over from my uncle's murder.

10:35.062 --> 10:36.133
Hello, Debbie.

10:36.421 --> 10:37.671
Shall we dance?

10:38.107 --> 10:39.807
I don't think so, Steve.

10:40.416 --> 10:42.364
Come on. Old times?

10:52.714 --> 10:54.206
I didn't know you danced.

10:54.331 --> 10:56.888
I do a lot of things now.
Adult things.

10:57.013 --> 10:58.959
Gave myself a prostate exam
this morning

10:59.084 --> 11:01.256
right after I drank a big cup of coffee.

11:01.381 --> 11:03.036
Next time I'll reverse the order.

11:10.005 --> 11:11.879
Thanks, Uncle Howie.

11:13.311 --> 11:15.580
Excuse me, sir,
but when I was in the bathroom

11:15.705 --> 11:18.572
I overheard a boy saying
he was gonna steal your gifts.

11:18.941 --> 11:20.864
- What?! Who?
- I couldn't see.

11:20.989 --> 11:23.537
I pee sitting down
because of my joints.

11:29.937 --> 11:35.115
If I was gonna steal my gifts,
how could I possibly do it?

11:39.302 --> 11:41.319
You're only spelling "A" and "C."

11:41.444 --> 11:44.594
I'm signaling the DJ to play
more adult contemporary.

11:54.993 --> 11:59.641
Up, looks like we got a request
for some adult contemporary!

12:11.661 --> 12:12.997
Why is it so hot?

12:13.142 --> 12:16.574
Etan, you've been standing here staring
at your presents the whole party.

12:16.699 --> 12:19.883
- Come and dance.
- No, someone is trying to steal them.

12:20.008 --> 12:22.880
What?
Come on. It's the chair dance.

12:26.245 --> 12:27.110
Fine.

12:51.059 --> 12:52.017
The vent!

12:52.142 --> 12:53.974
That's how they're going
to steal them!

12:55.861 --> 12:57.651
It's happening!
It's happening!

12:57.917 --> 12:59.046
Let me down!

12:59.306 --> 13:01.194
They're stealing my presents!

13:01.319 --> 13:03.526
They're stealing my presents!

13:09.993 --> 13:11.446
<i>See, thanks to Roger,</i>

13:11.571 --> 13:14.626
<i>Etan will think someone's trying
to steal the gifts on the cart.</i>

13:15.043 --> 13:16.729
But that's just a misdirection.

13:16.854 --> 13:19.548
The real gifts we're after
are the ones in his jacket.

13:20.034 --> 13:21.907
Scams make me so horny.

13:22.783 --> 13:26.887
<i>All party long Etan's relatives
will be handing him bar mitzvah cards,</i>

13:27.056 --> 13:29.107
<i>each filled with cash, checks,</i>

13:29.232 --> 13:31.976
<i>and written sentiments
that have no monetary worth,</i>

13:32.101 --> 13:33.603
<i>but are emotionally valuable.</i>

13:33.771 --> 13:35.021
What's gotten into you?

13:35.189 --> 13:37.315
No one is trying to steal your gifts.

13:39.506 --> 13:40.878
Oh, God.
Sorry, Snot.

13:41.003 --> 13:43.748
Steve, I have to wear this
to my bar mitzvah!

13:43.873 --> 13:47.032
Okay, okay, then we'll get it
to the cleaners right away.

13:47.157 --> 13:49.828
Have the valet pull our bikes around.
I'll be out in a second.

13:51.247 --> 13:55.865
Attention, I'm no longer accepting
request for <i>Brick House</i>.

13:56.752 --> 13:57.836
What the...?

13:59.784 --> 14:00.784
Stop him!

14:00.909 --> 14:02.435
Stop Steve Smith!

14:03.405 --> 14:05.150
Etan, what are you doing?

14:05.275 --> 14:08.075
Your old boyfriend stole
my bar mitzvah money.

14:08.200 --> 14:08.972
What?

14:09.140 --> 14:10.849
The presents were just a clever ruse.

14:11.197 --> 14:13.729
He was after the money the whole time.

14:17.270 --> 14:20.382
This is a card saying that Steve Smith
has paid for a tree

14:20.507 --> 14:22.736
to be planted in Israel
in your name.

14:27.816 --> 14:30.076
<i>What no one will know
is that Etan's money</i>

14:30.244 --> 14:32.533
<i>will already have left the ballroom,</i>

14:34.411 --> 14:36.767
<i>on someone who doesn't
even realize it.</i>

14:37.278 --> 14:40.767
<i>And I'll sneak the money off Snot
before he ever knows.</i>

14:41.468 --> 14:43.556
<i>It's the perfect plan.</i>

14:43.992 --> 14:45.550
Good, Steve, you're still here.

14:45.803 --> 14:48.386
<i>That is, unless Snot returns for some
reason and blows the whole thing.</i>

14:48.554 --> 14:52.933
Hey, am I crazy, or does this stain
look like El Vez, the Mexican Elvis?

14:53.263 --> 14:54.199
The cards!

14:54.324 --> 14:55.393
He stole them!

14:57.250 --> 14:58.191
Of course!

14:58.316 --> 15:01.481
You couldn't stand that my bar mitzvah
is a million times more awesome

15:01.606 --> 15:05.180
than your crummy one's going to be,
so you tried to ruin it!

15:06.008 --> 15:09.392
<i>And what Steve won't know
is that I have my own plan.</i>

15:09.646 --> 15:11.672
<i>While everyone's focused on Snot,</i>

15:11.797 --> 15:14.865
<i>I'll be heading to the bathroom
to share a doobie with the busboy</i>

15:14.990 --> 15:17.913
<i>in exchange for an angry handy jay.</i>

15:23.528 --> 15:26.273
Everyone thinks Snot
stole Etan's money.

15:26.398 --> 15:27.884
We have to come clean.

15:28.081 --> 15:29.981
We can't. We're in too deep.

15:30.494 --> 15:31.429
Here he comes.

15:33.385 --> 15:35.007
Stealing from a bar mitzvah?!

15:35.132 --> 15:36.482
Toats inappropes!

15:37.265 --> 15:39.471
That's for robbing
Etan's bar mitzvah.

15:39.596 --> 15:41.122
But you're skinheads.

15:41.247 --> 15:42.307
You hate Jews.

15:42.432 --> 15:45.927
What?
No, we're the Lex Luthor fan club.

15:46.052 --> 15:47.652
They're the skinheads.

15:49.921 --> 15:53.910
I still don't understand
how Etan's cards got in my jacket.

15:54.509 --> 15:56.846
It's a mystery, all right.
Don't worry, pal.

15:56.971 --> 15:59.583
Let's look to the future.
How's your bar mitzvah coming?

15:59.752 --> 16:02.085
He's not going to have
a bar mitzvah.

16:03.138 --> 16:07.106
Because I'm taking him
before the <i>Beth Din</i>!

16:07.378 --> 16:10.335
- <i>Beth Din</i>, I don't know what that is.
- Yeah, I may have gasped too soon.

16:10.460 --> 16:11.720
I know I gasped too soon.

16:11.889 --> 16:13.430
<i>Beth Din</i> ? What's that?

16:13.758 --> 16:16.763
The <i>Beth Din</i> is a council of 3 Jewish
elders from a temple

16:16.888 --> 16:18.874
which rules on matters of justice.

16:18.999 --> 16:22.799
Yours really is a rich and fascinating
tradition which we despise.

16:23.305 --> 16:25.183
Once the <i>Beth Din</i> hears what you did,

16:25.308 --> 16:27.915
not only will they kick you out
of our temple,

16:28.040 --> 16:30.544
no other temple will take you.

16:30.669 --> 16:32.378
You'll never be bar mitzvahed,

16:32.503 --> 16:36.383
doomed to walk the Earth
for the rest of your days as a child.

16:37.477 --> 16:39.789
The rest of my days as a child.

16:39.957 --> 16:41.865
{You think that's bad...}

16:41.990 --> 16:44.533
{I have to spend the rest of my days}

16:44.658 --> 16:46.838
{haunted by a 12th Century
Shogun Warrior.}

16:47.915 --> 16:50.718
{You know they can't understand you.}

16:50.843 --> 16:52.756
{Indeed Minamoto}

16:52.881 --> 16:55.474
{today's clam chowder
is quite delicious.}

17:00.115 --> 17:02.681
How'd the pitch go?
They didn't buy it, huh?

17:02.806 --> 17:05.481
- We never made it there.
- What?!

17:05.675 --> 17:07.861
I must have written down
the wrong address.

17:07.986 --> 17:09.669
We ended up
at an abandoned warehouse,

17:09.794 --> 17:12.146
where some thugs took my wallet
and then held your mother down

17:12.271 --> 17:14.223
and made her watch
while they kissed my neck.

17:14.348 --> 17:17.095
- I'm sorry. I can't do this.
- Just say your line.

17:17.220 --> 17:19.467
No, forget it.
My story makes no sense!

17:19.592 --> 17:23.458
We have a cell phone idea, but we never
get to pitch it because we get lost.

17:23.626 --> 17:26.765
You know what? If someone wants
to explain this garbage to me,

17:26.890 --> 17:28.964
I'll be in my trailer using
this script to wipe my...

17:29.382 --> 17:33.000
{TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES
PLEASE STAND BY!}

17:39.097 --> 17:41.977
Now Snot may never get
bar mitzvahed and it's my fault.

17:42.145 --> 17:45.188
All because you refused
to do the heist my way.

17:45.356 --> 17:47.857
How would you doing a goofy accent
have changed anything?

17:48.026 --> 17:49.669
We'll never know now, will we?

17:49.794 --> 17:51.851
There's only one way
to save Snot's manhood.

17:51.976 --> 17:54.176
I have to tell everyone the truth.

17:54.392 --> 17:56.236
Debbie, what a surprise.

17:56.595 --> 17:58.778
- So, how's it going?
- Not so good.

17:58.903 --> 18:00.232
I'm pretty hungry.

18:00.844 --> 18:02.205
And I broke up with Etan.

18:02.459 --> 18:03.540
You did?

18:03.708 --> 18:05.188
What Snot did was unforgivable,

18:05.313 --> 18:08.211
but Etan's behavior proved
he's not a man at all.

18:08.452 --> 18:10.197
<i>Three large pizzas with everything.</i>

18:10.322 --> 18:11.483
That's for me.

18:11.608 --> 18:13.485
But let's hang out sometime.

18:15.545 --> 18:17.426
There was supposed to be
a calzone with this.

18:17.551 --> 18:20.243
- Did you hear that, Roger?
- How Debbie didn't say "hi" to me?

18:20.368 --> 18:22.851
- No, I didn't.
- My plan is actually working!

18:23.019 --> 18:25.112
I think she might wanna
get back together!

18:25.237 --> 18:28.667
Oh, but she won't if she knows
I'm the one who tried to rob Etan.

18:28.792 --> 18:30.692
So, now I can't tell the truth
to help Snot.

18:30.860 --> 18:32.318
Look, if you wanna save Snot,

18:32.443 --> 18:35.531
the <i>Beth Din</i> has to be convinced
he deserves another chance.

18:35.656 --> 18:38.408
You need to find an expert
on Jewish law to defend him.

18:38.587 --> 18:40.990
Where am I going to find
an expert on Jewish law?

18:41.867 --> 18:43.540
You really have to ask me that?

18:43.873 --> 18:46.249
Hershel Hershbaum for the defense!

18:47.928 --> 18:50.257
Don't you worry, kid.
I'll win this for ya.

18:50.382 --> 18:52.380
We'll get your foreskin cut off,
all right.

18:52.505 --> 18:53.341
What?!

18:53.466 --> 18:55.801
This council will come to order.

18:55.936 --> 18:58.036
The accuser will state his case.

18:58.262 --> 18:59.362
Your honors,

18:59.578 --> 19:04.484
our noble tribe has spent millennia
devising a formidable code of ethics.

19:04.859 --> 19:08.569
Snot spit on that code
when he tried to steal from me.

19:08.854 --> 19:11.201
I demand his expulsion
from this temple

19:11.326 --> 19:15.320
and that you strip him of his upcoming
bar mitzvah ceremony. Thank you.

19:15.657 --> 19:18.323
Very well, does the defense
have a rebuttal?

19:20.835 --> 19:22.935
"Ethics" he wants to talk about.

19:23.645 --> 19:27.029
Jewish history is a history
of unethical conduct.

19:27.512 --> 19:31.753
1st, the Pharisees killed Jesus Christ,
the only true son of God.

19:32.877 --> 19:36.373
And isn't it true that the Jews
put a "secret sauce"

19:36.498 --> 19:39.743
on their Reubens that is actually
just Thousand Island?!

19:39.868 --> 19:41.863
And who shot Gianni Versace?

19:41.988 --> 19:43.048
Was it a Jew?

19:43.173 --> 19:45.141
I don't know.
It was in Miami.

19:45.919 --> 19:48.169
All right, enough of this <i>mishigas</i>!

19:48.478 --> 19:51.278
Snot, you are hereby banished
from this temple

19:51.622 --> 19:53.591
and will never be bar mitzvahed.

19:55.257 --> 19:56.124
My bill.

19:56.249 --> 19:59.757
Just so you're not shocked when you open
it, this big hat was a lot.

20:00.587 --> 20:01.817
I'm doomed!

20:03.703 --> 20:04.482
Wait!

20:05.293 --> 20:08.388
Snot had nothing to do
with stealing Etan's gifts.

20:08.771 --> 20:09.822
It was me.

20:10.091 --> 20:11.692
- I did it.
- What?

20:11.817 --> 20:13.562
Snot knew nothing about it.

20:13.687 --> 20:15.505
I planted those envelopes on him.

20:15.809 --> 20:18.675
I did it to get back at Etan
for stealing my girlfriend.

20:19.732 --> 20:20.844
I'm not surprised.

20:21.162 --> 20:23.304
Steve, how could you?

20:23.472 --> 20:25.346
If that is the case, young man,

20:25.471 --> 20:28.756
then Snot may indeed have
his bar mitzvah ceremony.

20:30.036 --> 20:31.186
Debbie, wait!

20:32.035 --> 20:34.916
- Snot, I'm sorry.
- Sorry doesn't cut it, Steve!

20:35.041 --> 20:38.613
Look, I already lost my girlfriend.
I can't lose my best friend.

20:38.807 --> 20:40.395
I promise I'll make it up to you.

20:40.520 --> 20:42.820
How could you ever make it up to me?

20:48.831 --> 20:50.690
Steve, this is amazing!

20:50.815 --> 20:52.554
But how could you
afford all of this?

20:52.679 --> 20:54.933
I had a garage sale
and sold all my toys.

20:55.058 --> 20:57.108
A guy's gotta grow up sometime.

21:00.590 --> 21:02.858
Hello, Snot, I'm Ernest Shlumpel,

21:02.983 --> 21:06.848
your long-lost relative from
Alsace-Lorraine by way of Mykonos.

21:10.208 --> 21:11.906
Wait. How'd I get here?

21:12.031 --> 21:13.771
I think I'm cracked in the head.

21:14.305 --> 21:20.559
