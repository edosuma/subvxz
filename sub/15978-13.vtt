WEBVTT

00:03.371 --> 00:05.673
(whistle blows)

00:05.706 --> 00:07.208
Nathan!

00:07.241 --> 00:09.177
How much longer is
this game gonna last?

00:09.210 --> 00:11.312
Can't really talk, Mom;
not a great time.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.181
I have a hair appointment
at 2:00.

00:13.214 --> 00:16.217
If we're late, my stylist
will skip my scalp massage.

00:16.250 --> 00:17.651
That's my favorite part!

00:17.685 --> 00:19.820
(laughs) What, you got
a beauty date with Mommy?

00:19.853 --> 00:20.821
Gonna get
a mani-pedi?

00:20.854 --> 00:21.822
Yeah, not pedis.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.291
It's winter, idiot.

00:23.324 --> 00:24.425
(whistle blows)

00:27.595 --> 00:29.330
Yoo-hoo!

00:29.363 --> 00:32.300
Do you know when this game
is gonna be over?

00:33.134 --> 00:34.202
Nobody knows, Carol.

00:34.235 --> 00:35.636
It's sudden-death overtime.

00:35.669 --> 00:37.238
How long is that gonna take?

00:37.271 --> 00:38.339
Hard to tell.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.374
We're both so evenly matched...

00:42.143 --> 00:43.344
(buzzer sounds)
It's over.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.379
Hey, man,
what happened?

00:45.413 --> 00:46.814
Your mother happened!

01:11.372 --> 01:13.107
Excuse me.
Sorry to intrude.

01:13.141 --> 01:15.376
Don't be embarrassed;
I know it's cold on the ice.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.710
Mom, Mom... Mom.

01:16.744 --> 01:17.645
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

01:17.678 --> 01:20.181
Well, what are you doing,
Mr. Dilly-Dally?

01:20.214 --> 01:22.483
You're gonna make me
miss my scalp massage.

01:22.516 --> 01:24.318
Last time, she hit
a pressure point

01:24.352 --> 01:25.819
that made me burst
into a song

01:25.853 --> 01:27.455
that I hadn't sung
since you were a baby.

01:27.488 --> 01:29.557
I wonder if I can
find it again.

01:29.590 --> 01:32.193
We're going out for beers
to discuss playoff strategies.

01:32.226 --> 01:34.428
Yeah, I-I'd love to,
but, uh, I can't.

01:34.462 --> 01:36.464
My mom doesn't drive,
and Saturday is errand day.

01:36.497 --> 01:37.898
CAROL:
I'm sorry, Ray,

01:37.931 --> 01:39.733
but we have
so much to do.

01:39.767 --> 01:42.270
After the salon,
I have to buy a bra,

01:42.303 --> 01:43.704
refill my
dry-mouth pills,

01:43.737 --> 01:46.140
pick up "get well"
balloons for my cousin,

01:46.174 --> 01:47.508
stock up on
craft supplies,

01:47.541 --> 01:49.343
get my pants hemmed
into capris,

01:49.377 --> 01:51.212
oh, and buy a new
razor to smooth out

01:51.245 --> 01:53.647
my soon-to-be on
display calves.

01:56.350 --> 01:57.585
I'm gonna do you a favor

01:57.618 --> 01:58.719
and tell the guys
you got diarrhea.

01:58.752 --> 02:00.288
Thanks, man.

02:01.889 --> 02:05.759
* Ah...

02:05.793 --> 02:08.696
* The wheels of the bus
go round and round *

02:08.729 --> 02:09.730
* Round and round

02:09.763 --> 02:11.532
That's the spot.

02:11.565 --> 02:13.734
* The wheels on the bus
go round and round *

02:13.767 --> 02:15.836
* All around the town...

02:15.869 --> 02:18.572
The ladies say hello.

02:18.606 --> 02:19.807
You should've
come in with me.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.542
You could've gotten
your brows done.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.411
Mom, I don't wax my brows.

02:23.444 --> 02:26.714
I told you, these are
naturally sculpted.

02:28.716 --> 02:30.484
You were wrong.

02:30.518 --> 02:34.322
They will exchange a half-eaten
bag of baby carrots.

02:38.559 --> 02:41.595
$40 to clean a comforter,
my foot.

02:41.629 --> 02:43.864
You and I will just
wash this in the bathtub.

02:47.968 --> 02:50.804
Toilet paper
was on sale.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.940
(laughs)

02:52.973 --> 02:55.876
Oh! Forgot my
calcium chews.

02:58.746 --> 02:59.747
Oh, wait.

02:59.780 --> 03:02.516
I thought these were
the orange calcium chews.

03:02.550 --> 03:03.917
These are licorice.

03:03.951 --> 03:05.953
I'll be right back.

03:08.889 --> 03:11.325
I got the orange
calcium chews.

03:11.359 --> 03:12.626
But you know what?

03:12.660 --> 03:14.362
You're starting to think
about the licorice again.

03:14.395 --> 03:16.697
I think it might be fun
to try something new.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.832
So fun.

03:18.866 --> 03:21.269
(knocking)

03:21.302 --> 03:22.603
What are you doing?

03:22.636 --> 03:23.937
Just get in
the driver's side.

03:23.971 --> 03:25.473
I want to show you
something great.

03:25.506 --> 03:26.774
(sighs)

03:26.807 --> 03:29.743
I don't know why we're
playing these games.

03:29.777 --> 03:31.579
We still have three
more places to go.

03:31.612 --> 03:33.881
Four, if the toilet's
still broken

03:33.914 --> 03:35.549
in the public library.

03:38.018 --> 03:40.854
That thing went
bananas on me last time.

03:40.888 --> 03:43.857
Okay. What do I have
to sit here to see?

03:43.891 --> 03:45.393
That woman in
the rearview mirror.

03:45.426 --> 03:46.394
Take a look.

03:46.427 --> 03:49.697
Today, she learns
how to drive.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.299
Oh, no.

03:51.332 --> 03:52.500
No, no, Nathan.

03:52.533 --> 03:53.567
I-I can't drive.

03:53.601 --> 03:54.935
I am going
to teach you.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.770
I can't keep
driving you around.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.706
Plus, this will
make you more independent.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.441
Trust me, your father
tried to teach me once,

04:00.474 --> 04:01.875
but it was a disaster.

04:01.909 --> 04:02.843
Oh, come on.

04:02.876 --> 04:05.346
You just... channel
some of that determination

04:05.379 --> 04:06.780
you have inside you.

04:06.814 --> 04:07.915
When I was breech,

04:07.948 --> 04:09.350
who reached up
and flipped me around?

04:09.383 --> 04:10.418
The doctors?

04:10.451 --> 04:11.419
No.

04:11.452 --> 04:13.321
You.

04:13.354 --> 04:14.988
You can do this.

04:16.524 --> 04:17.991
How's everybody else's
Saturday going?

04:21.094 --> 04:22.863
Oh, boy.

04:22.896 --> 04:25.065
Looks like someone's
teaching your mother to drive.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.567
Who leaves a tricycle

04:26.600 --> 04:28.068
where someone can
accidentally drive up

04:28.101 --> 04:29.803
on the sidewalk
and hit it?

04:29.837 --> 04:31.605
(door closes)

04:31.639 --> 04:34.608
I told Nathan I couldn't drive,
but he wouldn't listen.

04:34.642 --> 04:35.909
I am unteachable.

04:35.943 --> 04:36.910
No, you're not.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.879
You just refuse to be taught.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.514
I can teach anyone anything.

04:40.548 --> 04:43.050
Growing up, all our dogs
could use the toilet.

04:44.518 --> 04:47.054
Then why is your aim
so pathetic?

04:48.055 --> 04:48.889
Hey.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.524
Dinner's just about ready.

04:50.558 --> 04:51.959
Why is there a bumper in the...

04:51.992 --> 04:53.994
Oh, did someone try and teach
Mom how to drive?

04:54.027 --> 04:55.996
Yes, but for
no reason.

04:56.029 --> 04:56.997
I get by fine.

04:57.030 --> 04:59.333
I don't need to learn to drive.

04:59.367 --> 05:00.334
Uh, yeah, you do.

05:00.368 --> 05:01.669
'Cause I need
my life back.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.337
Okay? I can't
sacrifice every weekend

05:03.371 --> 05:05.038
driving you around
so you can run errands.

05:05.072 --> 05:06.340
Look, Nathan,
if you want a day off,

05:06.374 --> 05:07.675
Adam can drive Mom
around tomorrow.

05:07.708 --> 05:08.976
Adam can?

05:09.009 --> 05:10.811
Wow, great.
That'd be amazing.

05:10.844 --> 05:12.012
ADAM:
By the way, uh,

05:12.045 --> 05:13.714
Debbie, I need to talk to you

05:13.747 --> 05:14.948
about something completely
unrelated to this.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.650
Can we go in the kitchen
for a second?

05:16.684 --> 05:17.918
Um, sure, yeah.

05:17.951 --> 05:19.820
What do we need to...
Something unrelated.

05:21.922 --> 05:22.990
God, okay, what's wrong?

05:23.023 --> 05:24.057
What's wrong?
Your mother and I

05:24.091 --> 05:26.460
are not meant to be in
confined spaces together.

05:26.494 --> 05:28.862
Right? It's like asking the
chicken to drive the fox.

05:28.896 --> 05:30.864
You're gonna wind up with a car
full of blood and feathers.

05:30.898 --> 05:32.065
Oh, come on.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.266
It's not a big deal.

05:33.300 --> 05:35.869
And think of all the stuff
Nathan does for us, you know.

05:35.903 --> 05:37.037
Rent money, free appliances.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.672
You don't limp anymore

05:38.706 --> 05:41.375
because he paid to have
your right leg lengthened.

05:41.409 --> 05:44.678
And your left, when they went
overboard on your right.

05:44.712 --> 05:45.979
Your mother and I
have nothing in common.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.715
That's why she always
sets my dinner plate

05:47.748 --> 05:48.949
at the island with Mikayla,

05:48.982 --> 05:50.751
so she doesn't have
to talk to me.
Oh, come on.

05:50.784 --> 05:51.685
She doesn't do
that on purpose.

05:51.719 --> 05:52.753
And you know what?
Driving my mom around

05:52.786 --> 05:54.955
will give you a chance
to get to know her better.

05:54.988 --> 05:56.924
You might even have fun.
Who knows?

05:56.957 --> 05:58.959
I know. You won't.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.028
Yeah.

06:01.061 --> 06:02.996
(groans)
Just kill me.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.065
I can't be alone
in a car with Adam.

06:05.098 --> 06:07.067
We only have two topics
to talk about:

06:07.100 --> 06:09.770
the weather
and yesterday's weather.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.071
I'll just take the bus.

06:11.104 --> 06:13.674
Or... there's
a third topic:

06:13.707 --> 06:15.008
your granddaughter Mikayla.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.043
Or you could take the bus.

06:16.076 --> 06:18.011
In which case, every time
you want to get off,

06:18.045 --> 06:19.480
you got to pull that cord

06:19.513 --> 06:22.483
that the homeless guy
dries his socks on.

06:22.516 --> 06:23.817
Fine.

06:23.851 --> 06:24.952
(groans)

06:24.985 --> 06:27.788
Hey!

06:27.821 --> 06:29.990
There's my
handsome chauffer.

06:30.023 --> 06:31.158
(laughing)

06:31.191 --> 06:32.192
She's poking me.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.260
Carol is poking me.

06:33.293 --> 06:35.996
If this was anybody else,
it would be very annoying.

06:36.029 --> 06:37.665
(laughing)

06:37.698 --> 06:39.199
Okay, maybe we should all
just sit down and eat.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.469
Food smells good.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.070
Mikayla, dinner's ready!

06:43.103 --> 06:44.171
Adam, this is for you.

06:44.204 --> 06:46.974
A big helping for
my new driving buddy.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.809
How about we park you
right over here

06:48.842 --> 06:50.811
on the island?
Ah.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.513
Thank you, Carol.
Uh-huh.

06:54.214 --> 06:56.550
Mikayla, why don't you share
with your dad and your grandma

06:56.584 --> 06:58.051
anything new going on
in your life.

06:58.085 --> 07:01.088
That could be a, uh, lively
topic for continued discussion.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.461
I got nothing.

07:10.764 --> 07:14.067
Great. Now we just got
two topics left to talk about.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.103
ADAM:
Hey, you guys believe

07:16.136 --> 07:17.170
how cold it was today?

07:17.204 --> 07:18.105
Almost as cold as yesterday.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.142
And we're done.

07:31.852 --> 07:33.153
Good evening...

07:33.186 --> 07:35.489
dear sister.

07:35.523 --> 07:37.024
You look lovely.

07:37.057 --> 07:40.828
And there he is--
my wonderful father.

07:40.861 --> 07:43.130
Who smells vaguely
of cinnamon.

07:43.163 --> 07:46.767
I accidentally used
mouthwash as shampoo.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.836
Good for you!

07:48.869 --> 07:50.871
Well, somebody's in a good mood.

07:50.904 --> 07:51.705
Yeah, that's 'cause,

07:51.739 --> 07:53.707
while Adam was
driving Mom around,

07:53.741 --> 07:56.109
I slept in till 1:00
and started my Sunday

07:56.143 --> 07:58.045
watching football
and drinking Bloody Marys,

07:58.078 --> 08:00.581
and ate my lunch
out of a mixing bowl,

08:00.614 --> 08:04.051
and took a nap on
the kitchen floor, just 'cause.

08:06.253 --> 08:08.622
Then I went out
without a jacket on.

08:08.656 --> 08:10.223
Had to come back and get one,

08:10.257 --> 08:12.960
but it was still...
it was all my decision.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.127
Well, just remember,

08:14.161 --> 08:16.797
this happy day was brought
to you by your sister Debbie

08:16.830 --> 08:18.599
when she asks you for new tires.

08:18.632 --> 08:20.100
By the way, I need new tires.

08:21.769 --> 08:23.070
I know how sweet it is

08:23.103 --> 08:25.072
to have a Sunday
away from your mother.

08:25.105 --> 08:27.875
It's why I joined
the National Guard.

08:27.908 --> 08:30.243
(Carol and Adam laughing)

08:30.277 --> 08:31.779
CAROL:
Maybe you people can settle

08:31.812 --> 08:33.146
an argument for us.

08:33.180 --> 08:36.149
I think these are the best
cupcakes I've ever had,

08:36.183 --> 08:38.285
but Adam thinks the ones
I make are better.

08:38.318 --> 08:40.621
Well, when I eat yours,
I can taste the love.

08:40.654 --> 08:41.655
Oh, stop it!
(laughs)

08:41.689 --> 08:43.591
ADAM:
I'm sorry we're late.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.125
That's all my fault.
After we ran our errands,

08:45.158 --> 08:47.127
we took a little
side trip to the zoo.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.229
I tried that once;
they wouldn't take her.

08:51.632 --> 08:54.267
We went there so
someone could conquer

08:54.301 --> 08:56.236
his crippling
fear of giraffes.

08:56.269 --> 08:57.237
Oh, yeah.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.907
Even a horse with a long neck
freaks Adam out.

09:01.341 --> 09:03.143
H-How did this happen?
You were supposed to just...

09:03.176 --> 09:04.344
be out running errands.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.913
Well, we were,
but then I was helping Carol

09:05.946 --> 09:06.814
pick out some sandals.

09:06.847 --> 09:08.749
You went into the shoe store
with her?

09:08.782 --> 09:11.351
He went into all
the stores with me.

09:11.384 --> 09:16.089
Anyway, Adam was educating me
on leather versus pleather.

09:16.123 --> 09:17.725
Yes, and leopard
versus pleopard,

09:17.758 --> 09:19.760
which got us started talking
about animals.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.128
And that's when
he confessed to me

09:21.161 --> 09:23.196
that he was
terrified of giraffes.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.665
Why are you afraid of giraffes?

09:24.698 --> 09:27.234
You're a purple tongue away
from being one.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.903
When Adam was a little kid,

09:29.937 --> 09:32.039
a giraffe snatched
an ice cream cone from his hand

09:32.072 --> 09:33.373
and nearly took off his thumb.

09:33.406 --> 09:36.243
Nearly? It did. It spit it
halfway across the zoo

09:36.276 --> 09:38.245
and then a monkey
ran off with it.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.848
They had to craft me a new one
out of the bottom inch

09:40.881 --> 09:42.049
of my right leg bone.

09:42.082 --> 09:45.018
We all know
how that turned out.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.687
Wait, w-wait a second.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.889
I-I find this very hard
to believe.

09:48.922 --> 09:52.392
You're telling me you went
in all the stores with her?

09:52.425 --> 09:55.228
Every single one.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.731
Anyway, I told Adam the only
way to overcome his fear

09:57.765 --> 10:00.100
was to go back to
the scene of the crime,

10:00.133 --> 10:01.835
turn his back
on the giraffes

10:01.869 --> 10:03.671
and have an ice cream cone.

10:03.704 --> 10:04.838
And it worked.

10:04.872 --> 10:06.707
Who has two things
that pass for thumbs

10:06.740 --> 10:08.241
and isn't afraid
of giraffes anymore?

10:08.275 --> 10:11.078
This guy.

10:11.111 --> 10:14.181
Well...

10:14.214 --> 10:17.050
seems like you guys had a
really great day together.

10:17.084 --> 10:18.719
Mikayla, dinner's ready!

10:18.752 --> 10:21.288
Uh, Nathan...
Yeah.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.090
...uh, the bigger helping
is yours.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.124
Wait...

10:26.359 --> 10:28.061
I-I'm sitting there?

10:28.095 --> 10:30.998
Oh, if you want. I'm just
putting plates down wherever.

10:39.206 --> 10:41.308
Adam, I'm just putting
a little on our plate

10:41.341 --> 10:43.243
since we just had
ice cream and cupcakes.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.212
Plus, I ate some of
that giraffe's food

10:45.245 --> 10:46.914
just to even the score.

10:46.947 --> 10:48.015
(both laugh)

10:48.048 --> 10:50.283
Welcome to the island.

10:50.317 --> 10:53.086
We have our own salt.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.222
Where's my cutlery?

10:55.255 --> 10:57.124
You got to earn it.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.396
(timer dings)

11:03.430 --> 11:04.932
CAROL:
Ah, the cookies!

11:04.965 --> 11:07.234
You made cookies
for my hockey game?

11:07.267 --> 11:08.301
Mom, that's so sweet.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.003
Here, let me grab
one of those.

11:10.037 --> 11:12.372
Oh, no, no, no, they
have almonds in them.

11:12.405 --> 11:14.975
They have almonds in them?
I'm allergic to almonds.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.243
I know, but Adam's not.

11:16.276 --> 11:18.145
I wanted to do
something nice for him

11:18.178 --> 11:20.981
since he's been giving up
his weekends to drive me around.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.282
Okay, okay.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.217
I, uh, know what
you're doing here.

11:24.251 --> 11:25.318
I can see
your little...

11:25.352 --> 11:27.054
your little game
you're trying to play.

11:27.087 --> 11:29.289
And quite frankly, it's,
uh, it's very childish.

11:29.322 --> 11:30.490
What do you mean?

11:30.523 --> 11:32.259
Well, you're trying
to make me jealous.

11:32.292 --> 11:33.761
What?!

11:33.794 --> 11:35.062
No, I'm not.

11:35.095 --> 11:37.765
Honestly, I'm just
going about my life

11:37.798 --> 11:39.900
and giving you space
to go about yours.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.068
(knocking)

11:41.101 --> 11:42.402
Oh, it's Adam!

11:42.435 --> 11:43.236
What's he doing here?

11:43.270 --> 11:45.438
Is he coming
to my hockey game, too?

11:45.472 --> 11:47.841
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
I'm not coming to your game.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.477
Uh, before we run my errands,
Adam and I are going down

11:50.510 --> 11:53.313
to the creek to film our
audition for The Amazing Race.

11:54.447 --> 11:56.149
Coming!

11:56.183 --> 11:58.919
Wait. But you-you've never
missed one of my games,

11:58.952 --> 12:00.187
and this is a playoff game.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.522
Well, isn't there another one
next weekend?

12:02.555 --> 12:03.423
Well, if we win.

12:03.456 --> 12:06.093
Well, try to win, honey.

12:06.126 --> 12:07.795
BOTH:
Hey!

12:07.828 --> 12:09.496
Look what I have.
Matching T-shirts!

12:09.529 --> 12:10.330
Oh!

12:10.363 --> 12:12.365
Okay, our Amazing Race
team name:

12:12.399 --> 12:13.934
The Fun-In-Laws.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.368
(squeals)

12:15.402 --> 12:16.937
(both laugh)

12:16.970 --> 12:18.405
Hey, Nate.
Hey, brother...

12:18.438 --> 12:22.075
from another mother.

12:22.109 --> 12:23.343
Adam, these
are for you.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.378
Those special cookies
you were talking about.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.080
Oh, almond snickerdoodles!

12:27.114 --> 12:28.949
These are one of
my favorite doodles,

12:28.982 --> 12:30.818
right in between Cheez Doodles
and Labradoodles.

12:30.851 --> 12:33.854
Let me get your laundry
together, and then we'll go.

12:33.887 --> 12:34.888
Wait.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.223
You did his laundry?

12:36.256 --> 12:38.325
Well, it's the least I could do.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.227
He's been driving me around
all over town.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.830
Was Adam's laundry
in the dryer this morning?

12:42.863 --> 12:45.432
'Cause I grabbed
some boxers and...

12:45.465 --> 12:47.334
Oh, gross!

12:47.367 --> 12:49.302
I'm wearing Adam's underwear?!

12:49.336 --> 12:50.904
It's okay, boxer bro.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.505
No.

12:52.539 --> 12:56.243
No, we are not boxer bros,
so you can have these ba...

12:59.379 --> 13:01.481
(straining):
That was such a bad idea.

13:02.515 --> 13:03.951
I thought they would rip.

13:03.984 --> 13:05.485
They didn't rip.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.120
Something ripped.

13:09.089 --> 13:10.323
Nathan, you are acting crazy.

13:10.357 --> 13:11.391
Am I?!

13:11.424 --> 13:14.061
Am I the one
who's acting crazy?!

13:14.094 --> 13:15.095
Okay, you know what?

13:15.128 --> 13:16.363
This has gone
too far, Mom.

13:16.396 --> 13:17.330
You win, okay?

13:17.364 --> 13:20.167
I-I give up.
I'll start driving you again.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.435
Oh, calm down.
I don't want you to drive me.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.071
I'm fine. I prefer Adam.

13:24.104 --> 13:25.205
NATHAN:
Oh, really?

13:25.238 --> 13:26.439
You prefer Adam?

13:26.473 --> 13:28.075
Why? Give me one specific.

13:28.108 --> 13:29.309
Is it his soft supple hands

13:29.342 --> 13:31.044
that have never known
a day's work?

13:31.078 --> 13:32.980
Or the fact that he always
smells like hummus?

13:33.013 --> 13:35.448
Sorry, buddy, you're just kind
of in the line of fire here.

13:35.482 --> 13:38.351
Oh, were those insults?

13:38.385 --> 13:39.486
Seriously, Mom,
you can stop pretending

13:39.519 --> 13:42.422
to like spending time
with Adam just to get back at me

13:42.455 --> 13:43.590
for not driving you around.
Pretending?

13:43.623 --> 13:45.125
I'm not pretending.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.427
I like the way
he looks at me, okay?

13:47.460 --> 13:50.530
Adam listens to me
and values my advice.

13:50.563 --> 13:54.467
He happily lets me put sunscreen
on him even when it's cloudy.

13:54.501 --> 13:57.404
He actually reads the
comic strips I cut out for him.

13:57.437 --> 14:00.107
And when we buy pants,
he lets me put my fingers

14:00.140 --> 14:03.343
in his waistband to make sure
they're not too tight.

14:03.376 --> 14:07.080
Nathan, basically, he treats me
the way you used to...

14:07.114 --> 14:08.481
like a mother.

14:08.515 --> 14:12.119
Oh... boy.

14:12.152 --> 14:13.520
Uh, Carol...

14:19.559 --> 14:22.562
I hope I haven't been sending
you any mixed signals here.

14:22.595 --> 14:25.065
I love you
as a mother-in-law,

14:25.098 --> 14:27.367
but I'm not looking
for a mother, okay?

14:27.400 --> 14:28.501
I already have one.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.504
Maybe I'll have two

14:31.538 --> 14:33.506
if my mom finally works up
the courage

14:33.540 --> 14:36.009
to propose
to her bowling partner.

14:38.478 --> 14:40.580
I hope you're happy.

14:40.613 --> 14:43.016
I found someone I could have
a conversation with,

14:43.050 --> 14:44.251
and you ran him off.

14:46.053 --> 14:48.021
I need to be talked to, Nathan.

14:48.055 --> 14:50.090
A mother has needs.

14:50.123 --> 14:53.193
Oh, please, you and I have
conversations all the time.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.328
Not compared to other mothers
and sons.

14:55.362 --> 14:57.364
My friend Sharon tells me
that she and her son

14:57.397 --> 14:59.499
are chatting it up
four or five times a week.

14:59.532 --> 15:01.368
I'm lucky if I get in a quickie

15:01.401 --> 15:02.702
before you turn on
the television.

15:02.735 --> 15:05.472
Wham, bam, thank you, Mom!

15:05.505 --> 15:07.307
That's ridiculous!
I spent an hour the other night

15:07.340 --> 15:08.541
listening to you go on

15:08.575 --> 15:10.477
about how your pinky toe
is giving you fits.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.312
It was my pointer toe!

15:12.345 --> 15:14.414
I knew you weren't listening.
You were faking it!

15:14.447 --> 15:16.483
And don't think I didn't see you
take that little pill

15:16.516 --> 15:18.518
20 minutes before we had
our talk.

15:18.551 --> 15:20.988
It was a caffeine pill.
You were putting me to sleep.

15:21.021 --> 15:23.190
I needed that pill
to keep me up.

15:23.223 --> 15:25.092
Lots of sons take them.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.496
My conversations used to be
exciting enough

15:29.529 --> 15:31.431
that you didn't need a pill!

15:31.464 --> 15:33.400
And my hockey games
used to be exciting enough

15:33.433 --> 15:35.335
that you wanted
to come and cheer!

15:35.368 --> 15:37.570
But these days, you're too busy
looking at your watch!

15:37.604 --> 15:39.472
It's like you've completely lost
interest in the men's

15:39.506 --> 15:40.707
Mid-Atlantic Regional
News Station

15:40.740 --> 15:42.142
Division B hockey league!

15:43.643 --> 15:46.079
You say I don't treat you
like a mother?

15:46.113 --> 15:49.082
Well, maybe that's because
you don't treat me like a son.

15:49.116 --> 15:51.151
Lately, you just look at me
like a roommate.

15:51.184 --> 15:52.419
A roommate with a car!

15:52.452 --> 15:54.454
Yeah, well, maybe I'm just
gonna move out!

15:54.487 --> 15:56.323
Where are you gonna go?!
You can't even drive!

15:56.356 --> 15:58.725
Your father told me if I ever
felt like gambling with my life,

15:58.758 --> 16:00.560
he'd teach me to drive!

16:00.593 --> 16:03.430
Well, mama's feeling lucky.

16:05.598 --> 16:07.567
Have fun crashing Dad's car!

16:07.600 --> 16:10.303
Yeah? Well, have fun
trying to ice skate

16:10.337 --> 16:12.372
with a ripped scrotum!

16:20.480 --> 16:21.681
(tires screech)
Ooh! Oh, no!

16:21.714 --> 16:23.716
Oh, no! I hit him!

16:23.750 --> 16:26.186
That poor squirrel!

16:26.219 --> 16:28.388
You didn't hit the squirrel.
You just came close.

16:28.421 --> 16:29.522
Oh!
He's fine!

16:29.556 --> 16:31.524
He's just picking up
a French fry.

16:31.558 --> 16:33.560
(sobbing)

16:35.428 --> 16:37.697
Why can you never
be happy for someone else

16:37.730 --> 16:39.499
getting a French fry?

16:39.532 --> 16:42.202
I could've killed him.

16:42.235 --> 16:44.737
And that squirrel's mother
would have always regretted

16:44.771 --> 16:47.740
that she wasn't there
to cheer him across the road.

16:47.774 --> 16:49.609
Are you kidding?
It's almost spring.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.544
All she's thinking about
is eating nuts

16:51.578 --> 16:54.747
and getting knocked up.

16:54.781 --> 16:57.217
I'm not upset
about the squirrel.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.819
I'm upset about Nathan and me.

16:59.852 --> 17:03.356
I've been furious at him
for not making me feel special,

17:03.390 --> 17:05.792
but he was right.

17:05.825 --> 17:09.129
I haven't been treating him
special lately either.

17:09.162 --> 17:12.599
I'm looking at you,
but I'm completely lost.

17:12.632 --> 17:14.801
I've got to make this right.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.769
I've got to get
to that hockey game.

17:16.803 --> 17:19.672
I got to root my son on
the way I used to!

17:19.706 --> 17:21.474
Out of my way,
squirrel!

17:21.508 --> 17:23.410
(tires screech)

17:23.443 --> 17:25.445
You want to go?!
Yeah, you want to go?!

17:25.478 --> 17:27.614
What? She started it!

17:27.647 --> 17:30.083
Time-out, ref, time-out.

17:32.285 --> 17:33.653
That's your fourth
fight today.

17:33.686 --> 17:35.522
Your temper's gonna
cost us the championship.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.390
Which is gonna put us
in last place

17:37.424 --> 17:40.260
because there's only two teams
in this crappy league.

17:40.293 --> 17:41.461
Look, man, I'm sorry.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.830
It's just... I've been
fighting with my mom,

17:43.863 --> 17:45.498
and it's-it's got me
all worked up.

17:45.532 --> 17:47.234
You always fight
with your mom.

17:47.267 --> 17:48.468
Why you so mad?

17:48.501 --> 17:52.239
This isn't our everyday fight
about licking the steak knives.

17:52.272 --> 17:54.474
Which is dangerous.
You could cut your tongue off.

17:54.507 --> 17:57.510
(garbled): And you'd
be talking like this.

17:57.544 --> 17:59.746
No, the point is,
it's bigger than that, okay?

17:59.779 --> 18:01.614
You see, I've been
taking her for granted,

18:01.648 --> 18:03.183
and then she's gonna move out.

18:03.216 --> 18:04.351
And I don't want her
to move out.

18:04.384 --> 18:06.319
Who else is gonna be there
to welcome me

18:06.353 --> 18:08.355
when I come home at night
or make my breakfast smoothie?

18:08.388 --> 18:10.423
Or to sweep my hair
off the pillow

18:10.457 --> 18:12.459
before I wake up
so I don't freak out?!

18:12.492 --> 18:15.528
Point is, she is
the best mom/roommate

18:15.562 --> 18:18.431
a son could ask for,
and I've been a complete jerk.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.467
Well, why are you wasting your
time telling me this stuff?

18:20.500 --> 18:22.302
Tell her.

18:22.335 --> 18:24.771
Tell her before
it's too late.

18:24.804 --> 18:28.475
But the game...
the playoff game.

18:28.508 --> 18:32.845
Playoffs come and go,
but moms are forever.

18:32.879 --> 18:34.581
Go, Nathan.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.350
Go get her!

18:37.384 --> 18:38.618
I'm already gone.

18:38.651 --> 18:39.786
(laughs)

18:39.819 --> 18:42.522
Tell the guys
I had diarrhea...

18:42.555 --> 18:44.557
of the heart.

18:44.591 --> 18:47.194
*

18:57.904 --> 18:59.806
*

19:12.785 --> 19:14.787
*

19:22.662 --> 19:24.497
(screaming)

19:27.634 --> 19:29.469
(tires screech)

19:29.502 --> 19:30.870
(grunts)

19:32.472 --> 19:35.242
Nathan, are you okay?!

19:35.275 --> 19:38.445
Oh, God, I'm rising up
out of my body.

19:38.478 --> 19:40.580
No, I'm just sitting up.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.249
(sighs)

19:42.282 --> 19:43.816
Hey.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.486
If you need a witness,
it was all her fault.

19:46.519 --> 19:47.820
I saw everything.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.722
Thank you, ma'am.

19:49.756 --> 19:52.492
But actually,
you didn't see everything.

19:52.525 --> 19:55.595
You didn't see the things she
did before she plowed into me.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.964
Like put my towels in the dryer
so they're toasty

19:57.997 --> 19:59.566
when I get out of the shower.

19:59.599 --> 20:02.869
Put kale in my brownies
so I get my iron in a fun way.

20:04.671 --> 20:07.340
Or being kind enough to save her
errands for the weekend

20:07.374 --> 20:09.676
so she can spend a little
extra time with her son.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.411
Wait a second.

20:11.444 --> 20:12.879
You're Nathan Miller
from the news.

20:12.912 --> 20:15.415
I guess it's true what they say:

20:15.448 --> 20:16.716
don't meet your heroes.

20:18.685 --> 20:20.453
Oh.

20:20.487 --> 20:22.522
You're my hero.

20:22.555 --> 20:23.690
I'm sorry, Nathan,

20:23.723 --> 20:27.494
I lost track of what was
important and missed your game.

20:27.527 --> 20:28.895
I'm sorry I took you
for granted.

20:28.928 --> 20:29.962
I love you, Mom.

20:31.864 --> 20:34.534
Don't tell him you had
a chardonnay at lunch.

20:34.567 --> 20:35.868
(sighs)

20:35.902 --> 20:37.337
I may need another one

20:37.370 --> 20:39.639
after striking
my first pedestrian.

20:39.672 --> 20:41.974
But I think my driving lesson
is over for today.

20:42.008 --> 20:43.676
Come on.
I'll drive you home.

20:43.710 --> 20:46.446
And just so you know, I don't
mind driving you around anymore.

20:46.479 --> 20:48.014
Every once in
a while, maybe.

20:48.047 --> 20:50.617
But I'm going to continue
trying to learn.

20:50.650 --> 20:51.618
Before I ran over you,

20:51.651 --> 20:53.720
I was really starting
to get the hang of it.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.588
I saw you when I hit
the windshield.

20:55.622 --> 20:58.891
You looked
really confident.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.393
She had a scotch, too.
