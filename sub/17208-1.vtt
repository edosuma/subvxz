NARRATOR:

00:01.042 --> 00:03.044
<i>Finally! Welcome back.</i>

00:03.044 --> 00:04.755
<i>Let's review, shall we?</i>

00:04.755 --> 00:06.507
<i>This is Jane.</i>

00:06.507 --> 00:08.926
<i>You'll recall she was</i>

00:06.507 --> 00:08.926
<i>accidentally inseminated</i>

00:08.926 --> 00:10.093
<i>by Rafael's sperm.</i>

00:10.093 --> 00:11.929
<i>This is their baby, Mateo.</i>

00:11.929 --> 00:13.430
<i>Adorable, right?</i>

00:13.430 --> 00:16.308
<i>And this is</i>

00:13.430 --> 00:16.308
<i>Detective Michael Cordero Jr.</i>

00:16.308 --> 00:17.768
<i>And after a lot</i>

00:16.308 --> 00:17.768
<i>of back and forth</i>

00:17.768 --> 00:19.478
<i>and back again, well,</i>

00:19.478 --> 00:22.564
<i>Jane and Michael</i>

00:19.478 --> 00:22.564
<i>finally got married.</i>

00:22.564 --> 00:25.275
I pronounce you

00:22.564 --> 00:25.275
husband and wife.

00:25.275 --> 00:26.861
<i>And I may be biased,</i>

00:26.861 --> 00:30.071
<i>but can I just say--</i>

00:26.861 --> 00:30.071
<i>best wedding ever.</i>

00:30.071 --> 00:33.701
<i>I mean, this</i>

00:30.071 --> 00:33.701
<i>is everything, right?</i>

00:33.701 --> 00:35.786
<i>And it was thrown</i>

00:33.701 --> 00:35.786
<i>by Jane's father,</i>

00:35.786 --> 00:37.037
<i>international telenovela star</i>

00:37.037 --> 00:39.122
<i>Rogelio de la Vega.</i>

00:39.122 --> 00:40.415
<i>This is Jane's mother,</i>

00:40.415 --> 00:42.209
<i>Xiomara and, man,</i>

00:42.209 --> 00:43.669
<i>Rogelio loved her.</i>

00:43.669 --> 00:44.962
<i>But alas,</i>

00:44.962 --> 00:47.339
<i>he wanted kids,</i>

00:44.962 --> 00:47.339
<i>and she didn't,</i>

00:47.339 --> 00:48.590
<i>and so they broke up.</i>

00:48.590 --> 00:50.133
<i>And in a moment of weakness,</i>

00:50.133 --> 00:53.428
<i>Xo slept with</i>

00:50.133 --> 00:53.428
<i>his nemesis, Esteban.</i>

00:53.428 --> 00:55.514
<i>And, well, this happened.</i>

00:55.514 --> 00:56.891
ESTEBAN BOBBLEHEAD:

00:55.514 --> 00:56.891
I warned you.

00:56.891 --> 00:58.350
<i>I told you I bust out</i>

00:56.891 --> 00:58.350
<i>of condoms.</i>

00:58.350 --> 00:59.727
NARRATOR:

00:58.350 --> 00:59.727
<i>I know!</i>

00:59.727 --> 01:01.854
<i>Straight out of</i>

00:59.727 --> 01:01.854
<i>a telenovela, right?</i>

01:01.854 --> 01:03.522
<i>Well, imagine this.</i>

01:03.522 --> 01:06.525
<i>Rafael also had twins with</i>

01:03.522 --> 01:06.525
<i>his ex-wife, Petra.</i>

01:06.525 --> 01:07.985
<i>Oh, this is Petra.</i>

01:07.985 --> 01:11.780
<i>And this is Petra's</i>

01:07.985 --> 01:11.780
<i>twin sister, Anezka.</i>

01:11.780 --> 01:13.032
<i>And, well...</i>

01:13.032 --> 01:14.241
<i>this happened.</i>

01:13.032 --> 01:14.241
( gasps )

01:14.241 --> 01:17.036
<i>And poor Petra ended up...</i>

01:17.036 --> 01:19.413
<i>And then Anezka moved in</i>

01:17.036 --> 01:19.413
<i>on Rafael.</i>

01:19.413 --> 01:21.582
<i>I know,</i>

01:19.413 --> 01:21.582
<i>cray cray, right?</i>

01:21.582 --> 01:22.791
<i>Even crazier?</i>

01:22.791 --> 01:25.627
<i>This is Rafael's sister,</i>

01:22.791 --> 01:25.627
<i>Luisa.</i>

01:25.627 --> 01:27.588
<i>She used to date Rose,</i>

01:25.627 --> 01:27.588
<i>otherwise known as</i>

01:27.588 --> 01:29.256
<i>the criminal Sin Rostro.</i>

01:29.256 --> 01:31.258
<i>But now she was dating</i>

01:29.256 --> 01:31.258
<i>Michael's partner,</i>

01:31.258 --> 01:33.886
<i>Susanna, or she thought</i>

01:31.258 --> 01:33.886
<i>she was.</i>

01:33.886 --> 01:36.722
<i>And, friends, this</i>

01:36.722 --> 01:38.306
<i>is the hard part.</i>

01:38.306 --> 01:40.726
<i>See, Jane and Michael</i>

01:38.306 --> 01:40.726
<i>were about to have sex.</i>

01:40.726 --> 01:42.603
<i>But then...</i>

01:40.726 --> 01:42.603
Don't go anywhere.

01:42.603 --> 01:45.606
I won't.

01:42.603 --> 01:45.606
<i>...he ran into Susanna.</i>

01:45.606 --> 01:47.148
<i>And suddenly realized...</i>

01:47.148 --> 01:48.734
You're the mole,

01:47.148 --> 01:48.734
you've been leading us

01:48.734 --> 01:49.902
to Mutter this whole time.

01:49.902 --> 01:51.403
Why?

01:49.902 --> 01:51.403
Who are you working for?

01:54.322 --> 01:56.450
( gasps )

01:56.450 --> 01:57.993
Now, come on.

01:57.993 --> 01:58.994
It's time to go.

01:58.994 --> 02:00.328
NARRATOR:

01:58.994 --> 02:00.328
<i>Which, friends,</i>

02:00.328 --> 02:03.707
<i>I'm afraid is where</i>

02:00.328 --> 02:03.707
<i>we left off.</i>

02:05.417 --> 02:08.211
<i>For as long as</i>

02:05.417 --> 02:08.211
<i>anyone can remember,</i>

02:08.211 --> 02:09.922
<i>Jane Gloriana Villanueva</i>

02:09.922 --> 02:12.424
<i>believed in</i>

02:09.922 --> 02:12.424
<i>the epic love story.</i>

02:12.424 --> 02:15.343
<i>You know, two people</i>

02:12.424 --> 02:15.343
<i>destined for each other,</i>

02:15.343 --> 02:16.762
<i>overcoming obstacles,</i>

02:16.762 --> 02:19.222
<i>before finally finding</i>

02:16.762 --> 02:19.222
<i>their way</i>

02:19.222 --> 02:21.767
<i>into one another's arms.</i>

02:21.767 --> 02:25.437
<i>That's right,</i>

02:21.767 --> 02:25.437
<i>the stuff of romance novels.</i>

02:25.437 --> 02:27.272
<i>So her very first</i>

02:25.437 --> 02:27.272
<i>book reading...</i>

02:27.272 --> 02:31.110
<i>well, it was a very big deal.</i>

02:31.110 --> 02:33.570
"And though she vowed she

02:31.110 --> 02:33.570
would never love a soldier,

02:33.570 --> 02:34.989
"even though she knew

02:34.989 --> 02:36.490
"he was going to leave for Paris

02:36.490 --> 02:37.783
"at the end of the month,

02:37.783 --> 02:41.954
Noelle let herself fall."

02:41.954 --> 02:43.789
( applause )

02:43.789 --> 02:45.082
NARRATOR:

02:43.789 --> 02:45.082
<i>And our Jane...</i>

02:45.082 --> 02:47.042
<i>well, she came prepared.</i>

02:47.042 --> 02:48.502
What's that?

02:47.042 --> 02:48.502
A list.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.045
So I don't forget

02:48.502 --> 02:50.045
a main point.

02:50.045 --> 02:52.213
LAYLA:

02:50.045 --> 02:52.213
Now I'm happy

02:50.045 --> 02:52.213
to answer any questions.

02:52.213 --> 02:53.882
Yes.

02:53.882 --> 02:56.259
I would like to know why

02:53.882 --> 02:56.259
Noelle and Jean Luc

02:56.259 --> 02:57.469
don't get together at the end.

02:57.469 --> 03:01.723
Well, love

02:57.469 --> 03:01.723
doesn't always work out.

03:01.723 --> 03:03.308
JANE:

03:01.723 --> 03:03.308
Yeah, in real life.

03:03.308 --> 03:05.519
But this is a romance novel.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.896
In a romance novel, they get

03:05.519 --> 03:07.896
a happily ever after.

03:07.896 --> 03:10.315
Not happily until

03:07.896 --> 03:10.315
a mortar shell explodes

03:10.315 --> 03:12.567
just when Jean Luc's finally

03:10.315 --> 03:12.567
coming home from the war.

03:12.567 --> 03:14.028
All right, you made your point,

03:12.567 --> 03:14.028
sit down.

03:14.028 --> 03:16.071
LAYLA:

03:14.028 --> 03:16.071
Some romances

03:14.028 --> 03:16.071
don't end happily.

03:16.071 --> 03:18.866
Think of<i> Romeo and Juliet.</i>

03:18.866 --> 03:20.534
But that's one of

03:18.866 --> 03:20.534
Shakespeare's tragedies.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.536
Everyone knows in tragedies,

03:20.534 --> 03:22.536
they end up dead,

03:22.536 --> 03:24.245
in comedies,

03:22.536 --> 03:24.245
they end up happy,

03:24.245 --> 03:26.373
and in romance novels,

03:24.245 --> 03:26.373
they end up together.

03:26.373 --> 03:29.208
Well, sometimes you need

03:26.373 --> 03:29.208
to subvert the ending

03:29.208 --> 03:31.461
for the element of surprise.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.505
JANE:

03:31.461 --> 03:33.505
Great, fine, but then

03:31.461 --> 03:33.505
don't call it

03:33.505 --> 03:34.923
a romance novel,

03:33.505 --> 03:34.923
call it fiction.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.341
XIOMARA:

03:34.923 --> 03:36.341
I'm sorry,

03:36.341 --> 03:37.843
she was really upset

03:36.341 --> 03:37.843
when she finished the book.

03:37.843 --> 03:39.928
JANE:

03:37.843 --> 03:39.928
But of course I was.

03:39.928 --> 03:41.180
There are rules to the genre.

03:41.180 --> 03:42.806
Go to the RWA website.

03:42.806 --> 03:44.808
All over it,

03:44.808 --> 03:46.977
it says you need an HEA.

03:46.977 --> 03:48.311
WOMAN:

03:46.977 --> 03:48.311
I mean,

03:48.311 --> 03:49.855
I was disappointed too.

03:49.855 --> 03:51.648
I felt empty for days.

03:51.648 --> 03:53.901
You know, she really

03:51.648 --> 03:53.901
might be too young

03:53.901 --> 03:55.152
for this type of event.

03:55.152 --> 03:57.487
I told you

03:55.152 --> 03:57.487
to keep it together.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.031
It was spur of the moment.

03:59.031 --> 04:00.490
You had a list.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.201
Not so spur of the moment.

04:03.869 --> 04:06.663
But, anyway, you...

04:03.869 --> 04:06.663
You made some good points

04:06.663 --> 04:09.124
about genre or whatever.

04:09.124 --> 04:10.375
Well, I learned a lesson.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.211
From now on, I'm reading

04:12.211 --> 04:14.046
the ending of books first

04:12.211 --> 04:14.046
so I can be prepared

04:14.046 --> 04:15.255
for whatever happens.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.631
NARRATOR:

04:15.255 --> 04:16.631
<i>Which actually raises</i>

04:16.631 --> 04:17.799
<i>an interesting question--</i>

04:17.799 --> 04:19.634
<i>How does knowing the end</i>

04:19.634 --> 04:21.386
<i>affect the journey?</i>

04:22.930 --> 04:26.391
<i>Because some of you know</i>

04:22.930 --> 04:26.391
<i>how this is going to end.</i>

04:26.391 --> 04:27.642
Michael?

04:30.353 --> 04:32.856
Michael?

04:34.066 --> 04:35.358
Michael?

04:35.358 --> 04:36.777
( gasps )

04:37.861 --> 04:39.279
Oh, my God, Michael!

04:39.279 --> 04:40.864
Michael! Help!

04:40.864 --> 04:42.449
Somebody help!

04:42.449 --> 04:44.118
NARRATOR:

04:42.449 --> 04:44.118
<i>I should remind you</i>

04:42.449 --> 04:44.118
<i>that I did say</i>

04:44.118 --> 04:45.244
<i>that Michael would love Jane</i>

04:45.244 --> 04:46.995
<i>until his dying breath.</i>

04:46.995 --> 04:48.496
Okay, you're breathing.

04:48.496 --> 04:49.998
<i>Thank God.</i>

04:49.998 --> 04:52.751
Help! Somebody help, please!

04:52.751 --> 04:54.294
( crying ):

04:52.751 --> 04:54.294
Okay.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.587
Stay with me, baby.

04:55.587 --> 04:58.257
<i>Stay with me please.</i>

04:55.587 --> 04:58.257
<i>Stay with me...</i>

04:58.257 --> 04:59.758
NARRATOR:

04:58.257 --> 04:59.758
<i>Which brings us here.</i>

05:01.760 --> 05:03.262
<i>Now...</i>

05:03.262 --> 05:05.222
Any updates?

05:03.262 --> 05:05.222
No.

05:05.222 --> 05:07.599
( in Spanish ):

05:05.222 --> 05:07.599
But he was breathing.

05:14.982 --> 05:17.067
NARRATOR:

05:14.982 --> 05:17.067
<i>Unfortunately, friends,</i>

05:17.067 --> 05:19.527
<i>there was no way for Jane</i>

05:17.067 --> 05:19.527
<i>to prepare for this.</i>

05:29.329 --> 05:30.914
JANE:

05:29.329 --> 05:30.914
<i>Oh, I can't take this waiting.</i>

05:30.914 --> 05:32.791
NARRATOR:

05:30.914 --> 05:32.791
<i>It's torture.</i>

05:32.791 --> 05:35.002
He's gonna be okay, hon.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.253
You don't know that.

05:36.253 --> 05:37.963
NARRATOR:

05:36.253 --> 05:37.963
<i>Which is true</i>

05:37.963 --> 05:39.881
<i>because she couldn't skip ahead</i>

05:37.963 --> 05:39.881
<i>to the ending.</i>

05:39.881 --> 05:42.383
<i>And we can't either.</i>

05:42.383 --> 05:44.928
<i>So instead, let's flip back...</i>

05:44.928 --> 05:46.596
( pages turning )

05:46.596 --> 05:49.224
<i>...to earlier</i>

05:46.596 --> 05:49.224
<i>in our epic romance.</i>

05:49.224 --> 05:51.101
( pages flipping quickly )

05:56.355 --> 05:58.692
<i>Oops, that's a little too far.</i>

06:00.819 --> 06:03.530
<i>Ah, here we are.</i>

06:03.530 --> 06:05.699
You're seriously not

06:03.530 --> 06:05.699
gonna help at all?

06:05.699 --> 06:08.035
<i>The morning after</i>

06:05.699 --> 06:08.035
<i>Jane's 21st birthday</i>

06:08.035 --> 06:10.204
<i>was somewhat less festive</i>

06:08.035 --> 06:10.204
<i>than the night before.</i>

06:10.204 --> 06:11.246
Nope.

06:11.246 --> 06:13.332
NARRATOR:

06:11.246 --> 06:13.332
<i>For Xo at least.</i>

06:13.332 --> 06:14.875
What?

06:14.875 --> 06:16.793
We agreed that cleanup

06:14.875 --> 06:16.793
was part of your punishment

06:16.793 --> 06:18.586
for last night's behavior.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.586
( phone chimes )

06:18.586 --> 06:20.214
Oh!

06:20.214 --> 06:22.716
The cop wants to

06:20.214 --> 06:22.716
see me again tonight.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.592
Wow.

06:24.592 --> 06:25.969
And I really booted

06:24.592 --> 06:25.969
on his shoes?

06:25.969 --> 06:27.262
Twice.

06:27.262 --> 06:28.847
( giggles )

06:28.847 --> 06:30.765
I swear, it's like we

06:28.847 --> 06:30.765
already have private jokes.

06:30.765 --> 06:32.517
I mean, they're all

06:30.765 --> 06:32.517
about you so far, but still.

06:32.517 --> 06:34.477
( deadpan )

06:32.517 --> 06:34.477
Ha, ha.

06:34.477 --> 06:36.563
( in normal voice )

06:34.477 --> 06:36.563
I just can't picture you

06:34.477 --> 06:36.563
with a cop.

06:36.563 --> 06:38.940
I know,

06:36.563 --> 06:38.940
but I'm telling you, Ma,

06:38.940 --> 06:41.985
that kiss, it was...

06:41.985 --> 06:43.320
magic.

06:44.487 --> 06:46.823
( car pulling up in distance )

06:46.823 --> 06:48.075
Oh, my God.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.117
Sam just pulled up.

06:49.117 --> 06:50.869
Sam?

06:49.117 --> 06:50.869
Yes, Sam!

06:50.869 --> 06:52.662
NARRATOR:

06:50.869 --> 06:52.662
<i>I know what you're thinking,</i>

06:52.662 --> 06:54.664
<i>who the hell is Sam?</i>

06:52.662 --> 06:54.664
Oh, my God, he's coming.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.208
( car door closes )

06:54.664 --> 06:56.208
Am I too gross?

06:56.208 --> 06:58.293
Do I smell?

06:56.208 --> 06:58.293
Y-you're good, you're good.

06:58.293 --> 06:59.627
You're not,

06:58.293 --> 06:59.627
so stay away from him.

06:59.627 --> 07:01.129
( doorbell rings )

06:59.627 --> 07:01.129
Go on, open the door

07:01.129 --> 07:02.381
and act like you haven't been

07:02.381 --> 07:03.924
obsessively crushing on him

07:02.381 --> 07:03.924
for two years.

07:03.924 --> 07:06.760
Seventeen months.

07:03.924 --> 07:06.760
( scoffs )

07:06.760 --> 07:08.220
( seductive music plays )

07:08.220 --> 07:10.597
NARRATOR:

07:08.220 --> 07:10.597
<i>Well, hello, Sam.</i>

07:10.597 --> 07:12.307
Oh, hey.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.307
( chuckles )

07:12.307 --> 07:14.475
Wanted to drop something off.

07:14.475 --> 07:15.727
Is now an okay time?

07:16.853 --> 07:18.897
Yeah, totally.

07:19.898 --> 07:20.941
( Jane inhales )

07:22.276 --> 07:25.862
Actually, let's, um,

07:22.276 --> 07:25.862
sit outside.

07:25.862 --> 07:27.406
( door closes )

07:27.406 --> 07:29.283
NARRATOR:

07:27.406 --> 07:29.283
<i>Now might be a good time</i>

07:27.406 --> 07:29.283
<i>to mention</i>

07:29.283 --> 07:31.285
<i>that Jane had been in</i>

07:29.283 --> 07:31.285
<i>a love triangle once before.</i>

07:31.285 --> 07:32.911
I'm sorry I couldn't

07:31.285 --> 07:32.911
make it last night, I...

07:32.911 --> 07:34.579
was trying to bang out

07:32.911 --> 07:34.579
that Chaucer paper,

07:34.579 --> 07:36.539
and then, before I knew it,

07:34.579 --> 07:36.539
it was 2 in the morning.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.708
Oh. So not a big deal.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.708
No, I...

07:38.708 --> 07:41.336
I wanted to come.

07:38.708 --> 07:41.336
NARRATOR:<i> Of course,</i>

07:41.336 --> 07:42.796
<i>you already know</i>

07:41.336 --> 07:42.796
<i>how this one ends.</i>

07:42.796 --> 07:44.214
<i>But still,</i>

07:44.214 --> 07:45.840
<i>the journey's worth it,</i>

07:44.214 --> 07:45.840
<i>trust me.</i>

07:45.840 --> 07:47.092
Anyway,

07:47.092 --> 07:49.344
happy birthday.

07:49.344 --> 07:50.971
Thank you.

07:58.019 --> 07:59.229
Antarctica.

07:59.229 --> 08:00.563
Huh?

08:00.563 --> 08:02.732
That's where Bernadette went.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.818
I know how you like

08:02.732 --> 08:04.818
to know the ending.

08:06.278 --> 08:07.737
NARRATOR:

08:06.278 --> 08:07.737
<i>Yeah, you're gonna want to</i>

08:07.737 --> 08:09.864
<i>back off that smile,</i>

08:07.737 --> 08:09.864
<i>just a little.</i>

08:09.864 --> 08:12.326
Thank you, I can't wait

08:09.864 --> 08:12.326
to read it.

08:09.864 --> 08:12.326
Before tonight?

08:12.326 --> 08:15.996
Maria Semple is doing a reading.

08:12.326 --> 08:15.996
Come with me.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.622
NARRATOR:<i> Like a date?</i>

08:15.996 --> 08:17.622
<i>I'd love to.</i>

08:17.622 --> 08:19.707
NARRATOR:

08:17.622 --> 08:19.707
<i>Or is it not a date?</i>

08:19.707 --> 08:21.668
Like, um...like

08:19.707 --> 08:21.668
just the two of us?

08:21.668 --> 08:23.628
I hope not,

08:21.668 --> 08:23.628
for Maria Semple's sake.

08:23.628 --> 08:24.754
Oh.

08:23.628 --> 08:24.754
( laughs loudly )

08:24.754 --> 08:26.423
NARRATOR:

08:24.754 --> 08:26.423
<i>Not</i> that<i> funny.</i>

08:26.423 --> 08:27.674
( chuckles softly )

08:27.674 --> 08:29.384
Um...

08:29.384 --> 08:31.428
I just meant, like,

08:29.384 --> 08:31.428
did you want to pick me up,

08:31.428 --> 08:33.805
or should we just meet there?

08:31.428 --> 08:33.805
No.

08:33.805 --> 08:35.223
I'll pick you up at 7.

08:35.223 --> 08:37.058
And if you want to

08:35.223 --> 08:37.058
know how it's gonna end,

08:37.058 --> 08:39.436
I'm gonna try and kiss you.

08:39.436 --> 08:42.314
You won't have to try that hard.

08:39.436 --> 08:42.314
( soft chuckle )

08:48.153 --> 08:49.446
( door opens )

08:49.446 --> 08:51.365
( humming )

08:51.365 --> 08:54.742
Oh, my God,

08:51.365 --> 08:54.742
Sam just asked me out!

08:54.742 --> 08:56.495
No!

08:54.742 --> 08:56.495
Yes, for tonight!

08:56.495 --> 08:58.497
What about the cop?

08:56.495 --> 08:58.497
What cop?

08:58.497 --> 08:59.998
Oh.

09:05.379 --> 09:07.839
You're here

09:05.379 --> 09:07.839
for Michael Cordero?

09:07.839 --> 09:09.799
I'm Dr. Lewis and

09:07.839 --> 09:09.799
I'm part of the trauma team.

09:09.799 --> 09:12.052
Right now he's in

09:09.799 --> 09:12.052
critical condition.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.012
The bullet missed his heart,

09:12.052 --> 09:14.012
but it transected

09:14.012 --> 09:16.139
some major

09:14.012 --> 09:16.139
pulmonary vessels.

09:16.139 --> 09:17.598
There's a lot of bleeding

09:16.139 --> 09:17.598
in his chest,

09:17.598 --> 09:19.142
we're still trying

09:17.598 --> 09:19.142
to stabilize him.

09:19.142 --> 09:21.853
But is he, um...

09:21.853 --> 09:23.980
Will he be all right?

09:23.980 --> 09:25.773
Honestly,

09:23.980 --> 09:25.773
we don't know yet.

09:25.773 --> 09:29.319
You're his wife?

09:29.319 --> 09:31.154
Yes, I am.

09:31.154 --> 09:32.406
Here.

09:32.406 --> 09:33.698
You should hold onto this.

09:33.698 --> 09:36.617
NARRATOR:

09:33.698 --> 09:36.617
<i>You know,</i>

09:36.617 --> 09:38.953
<i>if this were a romance novel,</i>

09:38.953 --> 09:40.830
<i>right about now I'd need</i>

09:38.953 --> 09:40.830
<i>to put the book down</i>

09:40.830 --> 09:42.457
<i>and take a break.</i>

09:50.048 --> 09:51.925
NARRATOR:

09:50.048 --> 09:51.925
<i>Ah, yes, we were imagining</i>

09:51.925 --> 09:53.760
<i>this was a romance novel.</i>

09:53.760 --> 09:57.013
<i>Either way, here we are.</i>

09:53.760 --> 09:57.013
( pages turning )

09:57.013 --> 09:59.307
So sorry to bug you, but the

09:57.013 --> 09:59.307
doctor just gave us an update,

09:59.307 --> 10:00.767
and I think I was in shock,

10:00.767 --> 10:02.852
and I didn't ask anything.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.479
But now I'm prepared,

10:02.852 --> 10:04.479
so I was wondering

10:04.479 --> 10:07.482
if I can talk to a doctor,

10:04.479 --> 10:07.482
any doctor?

10:07.482 --> 10:09.526
It doesn't even have to be

10:07.482 --> 10:09.526
one of your good ones.

10:09.526 --> 10:10.860
Let me see if I

10:09.526 --> 10:10.860
can find someone.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.904
Thank you so much.

10:16.408 --> 10:18.993
Oh, Patricia, hi.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.289
How is he?

10:22.289 --> 10:24.707
Any update?

10:24.707 --> 10:26.876
No, not since we talked.

10:28.711 --> 10:30.464
We just have to have faith.

10:30.464 --> 10:31.672
Well, I don't know about faith.

10:31.672 --> 10:32.757
What we need is information.

10:32.757 --> 10:33.674
Mrs. Cordero?

10:33.674 --> 10:34.842
Yes.

10:34.842 --> 10:36.344
Um, this is

10:34.842 --> 10:36.344
Dr. Sterling.

10:36.344 --> 10:37.845
He's familiar

10:36.344 --> 10:37.845
with Mr. Cordero's case.

10:37.845 --> 10:39.306
I heard you have

10:37.845 --> 10:39.306
some questions.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.933
Good. Yes. I need to know

10:39.306 --> 10:41.933
what his condition is.

10:41.933 --> 10:43.602
Exactly.

10:43.602 --> 10:46.563
Go on. You have your list.

10:46.563 --> 10:48.189
No, it's fine.

10:48.189 --> 10:49.316
...friend who's a surgeon,

10:49.316 --> 10:50.650
and he said

10:49.316 --> 10:50.650
to ask specifically...

10:50.650 --> 10:52.277
NARRATOR:

10:50.650 --> 10:52.277
<i>I'm with Alba.</i>

10:52.277 --> 10:54.321
<i>You need to have faith.</i>

10:54.321 --> 10:56.239
<i>In fact, in many ways,</i>

10:56.239 --> 10:59.033
<i>this is a story about faith...</i>

10:56.239 --> 10:59.033
I don't know.

10:59.033 --> 11:01.411
NARRATOR:

10:59.033 --> 11:01.411
<i>...faith that the past</i>

10:59.033 --> 11:01.411
<i>will have some connection</i>

11:01.411 --> 11:04.122
<i>to the present.</i>

11:01.411 --> 11:04.122
It's only a little white lie.

11:04.122 --> 11:06.541
No one gets hurt.

11:04.122 --> 11:06.541
Michael will never know.

11:06.541 --> 11:09.544
( door opens )

11:06.541 --> 11:09.544
( in Spanish ): Hello. I'm back.

11:09.544 --> 11:10.711
JANE:

11:09.544 --> 11:10.711
Welcome back, Abuela.

11:10.711 --> 11:13.006
XIOMARA:

11:10.711 --> 11:13.006
Hi, Ma.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.673
What happened

11:13.006 --> 11:14.673
to the ceiling?

11:14.673 --> 11:17.302
This looks like a real gun!

11:14.673 --> 11:17.302
( screaming )

11:17.302 --> 11:20.430
Uh, champagne cork

11:17.302 --> 11:20.430
from the big birthday bash.

11:20.430 --> 11:24.725
( scoffs ):

11:20.430 --> 11:24.725
Hi, Abuela.

11:24.725 --> 11:26.144
Mwah.

11:26.144 --> 11:27.979
So, Ma, ever since

11:26.144 --> 11:27.979
Jane turned 21,

11:27.979 --> 11:30.023
she's been juggling men

11:27.979 --> 11:30.023
like crazy.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.399
I met someone sweet

11:30.023 --> 11:31.399
last night,

11:31.399 --> 11:33.860
and then Sam

11:31.399 --> 11:33.860
asked me out.

11:34.444 --> 11:35.694
What?

11:35.694 --> 11:37.364
Less shocked.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.532
It's been two years.

11:38.532 --> 11:40.283
Seventeen months,

11:38.532 --> 11:40.283
people.

11:40.283 --> 11:41.951
But, yes,

11:40.283 --> 11:41.951
I know.

11:41.951 --> 11:44.371
Finally,

11:41.951 --> 11:44.371
the whole dance is over.

11:44.371 --> 11:47.290
Okay, it was more like

11:44.371 --> 11:47.290
a solo, but, still.

11:47.290 --> 11:49.417
You know, I stuck with him

11:47.290 --> 11:49.417
while he dated Kelly

11:49.417 --> 11:51.294
and hung in

11:49.417 --> 11:51.294
through the whole Julia fiasco.

11:51.294 --> 11:53.380
And now, finally, finally...

11:53.380 --> 11:55.298
NARRATOR:

11:53.380 --> 11:55.298
<i>I'm gonna be honest, friends.</i>

11:55.298 --> 11:56.966
<i>She saw the HEA.</i>

11:56.966 --> 11:58.885
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

11:56.966 --> 11:58.885
it's a beautiful story.

11:58.885 --> 12:00.428
Hopefully we'll tell it

11:58.885 --> 12:00.428
at your wedding.

12:00.428 --> 12:02.180
But just to keep

12:00.428 --> 12:02.180
your options open,

12:02.180 --> 12:04.057
tell the other guy

12:02.180 --> 12:04.057
you're sick.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.933
No.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.933
Don't lie, Jane.

12:05.933 --> 12:07.185
It's harmless.

12:07.185 --> 12:09.437
Lies spiral.

12:09.437 --> 12:12.023
Who are you gonna take dating

12:09.437 --> 12:12.023
advice from, me or Abuela?

12:12.023 --> 12:13.608
( groans softly )

12:14.942 --> 12:16.903
( chuckles )

12:16.903 --> 12:19.447
Sorry, Abuela.

12:30.584 --> 12:33.670
Uh-uh. Less detail.

12:38.091 --> 12:41.928
NARRATOR:

12:38.091 --> 12:41.928
<i>All right, now let's skip</i>

12:38.091 --> 12:41.928
<i>ahead, shall we?</i>

12:41.928 --> 12:43.804
( laughing )

12:43.804 --> 12:45.973
<i>Oh, this is</i>

12:54.107 --> 12:56.484
<i>Okay, here we are,</i>

12:54.107 --> 12:56.484
<i>later that night.</i>

12:56.484 --> 12:58.570
Have fun.

12:56.484 --> 12:58.570
I will.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.154
( in Spanish ):

12:58.570 --> 13:00.154
Not too much fun.

13:00.154 --> 13:01.906
I won't.

13:06.035 --> 13:08.580

13:27.515 --> 13:29.808
Uh, what'd I do?

13:29.808 --> 13:33.229
I don't know.

13:29.808 --> 13:33.229
You weren't speeding.

13:39.193 --> 13:40.570
Uh, sure.

13:41.820 --> 13:42.947
What did he do?

13:42.947 --> 13:44.073
Illegal U-turn.

13:44.073 --> 13:45.533
Oh, wow,

13:44.073 --> 13:45.533
I'm sorry.

13:45.533 --> 13:47.452
Ma'am, I'm going

13:45.533 --> 13:47.452
to have to ask you

13:47.452 --> 13:48.495
to step out

13:47.452 --> 13:48.495
of the vehicle.

13:48.495 --> 13:49.663
What?

13:48.495 --> 13:49.663
Excuse me?

13:49.663 --> 13:51.247
Ma'am, please.

13:49.663 --> 13:51.247
Uh, no, no.

13:51.247 --> 13:52.873

13:51.247 --> 13:52.873
JANE: It's fine.

13:52.873 --> 13:53.916
I know him.

13:53.916 --> 13:55.502
I'll be right back.

13:59.255 --> 14:02.300
Okay. What's going on?

13:59.255 --> 14:02.300
That's what I'd like to know.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.051
Are you stalking me?

14:02.300 --> 14:04.051
No, I'm not stalking you.

14:04.051 --> 14:05.804
I happened to be

14:04.051 --> 14:05.804
dropping by your house

14:05.804 --> 14:07.846
to bring you some soup

14:05.804 --> 14:07.846
'cause you said you were sick.

14:07.846 --> 14:08.973
I made it myself.

14:08.973 --> 14:10.642
It's an old

14:08.973 --> 14:10.642
family recipe.

14:10.642 --> 14:12.644
Anyway, then you left

14:10.642 --> 14:12.644
your house, clearly not sick,

14:12.644 --> 14:14.354
and I happened to see you

14:12.644 --> 14:14.354
get in the car,

14:14.354 --> 14:16.897
which then engaged in some

14:14.354 --> 14:16.897
illegal activity.

14:16.897 --> 14:18.566
He made a U-turn

14:16.897 --> 14:18.566
on an empty street.

14:18.566 --> 14:19.693
An illegal U-turn.

14:19.693 --> 14:21.152
Hey, is everything

14:19.693 --> 14:21.152
okay back there?

14:21.152 --> 14:23.237
Sir, please keep your head

14:21.152 --> 14:23.237
inside the vehicle.

14:25.281 --> 14:26.866
Anyway, here's your soup.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.618
Thank you.

14:28.618 --> 14:29.952
Have a good night.

14:33.623 --> 14:35.667
Is there anything

14:33.623 --> 14:35.667
that I can do?

14:35.667 --> 14:36.876
JANE:

14:35.667 --> 14:36.876
<i>No.</i>

14:36.876 --> 14:38.586
Just keep Mateo safe.

14:38.586 --> 14:39.838
<i>Of course.</i>

14:39.838 --> 14:41.756
There are cops

14:39.838 --> 14:41.756
all over the hotel.

14:41.756 --> 14:43.508
They've assured me

14:41.756 --> 14:43.508
it's completely secured.

14:43.508 --> 14:44.967
Any leads?

14:44.967 --> 14:46.344
<i>I don't think so.</i>

14:46.344 --> 14:48.388
<i>But they will figure out</i>

14:46.344 --> 14:48.388
<i>who did this.</i>

14:48.388 --> 14:51.349
Yeah. Bye.

14:51.349 --> 14:53.643
So, unfortunately,

14:51.349 --> 14:53.643
the security footage

14:53.643 --> 14:55.186
in that hallway

14:53.643 --> 14:55.186
was wiped out.

14:55.186 --> 14:56.563
What?

14:56.563 --> 14:58.565
Speaks to a pretty

14:56.563 --> 14:58.565
sophisticated shooter.

14:58.565 --> 15:01.568
Or someone familiar

14:58.565 --> 15:01.568
with the hotel systems.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.110
You said you were here

15:01.568 --> 15:03.110
last night?

15:03.110 --> 15:04.237
Yes.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.280
Alone?

15:06.280 --> 15:08.700
( tribal drumming plays )

15:08.700 --> 15:09.659
( gasps )

15:09.659 --> 15:10.744
No.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.953
I was with

15:10.744 --> 15:12.953

( Czech accent ):

15:18.543 --> 15:21.462

He was being very...sweet.

15:24.215 --> 15:27.761
( giggles )

15:27.761 --> 15:29.262
Did you have sex with him?

No.

( giggles )

15:31.972 --> 15:33.307

15:37.562 --> 15:40.064
You do not laugh like that.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.232
You are not an idiot.

15:41.232 --> 15:44.611
<i>I need you to stay focused.</i>

15:44.611 --> 15:48.615

Petra with paralytic poison?

15:54.746 --> 15:56.163
At 10.

MAGDA:

15:56.163 --> 15:57.707
<i>Okay.</i>

15:57.707 --> 16:01.836

to baste the chicken

16:01.836 --> 16:03.838
in six hours.

16:03.838 --> 16:05.465
Give Petra another shot

16:03.838 --> 16:05.465

16:05.465 --> 16:06.466
So she doesn't wake up!

16:06.466 --> 16:08.843
I know, I know. Don't worry.

16:08.843 --> 16:10.261
<i>But you know,</i>

Hold on, Mother.

16:27.403 --> 16:30.156
Hi again, Mrs. Solano.

16:30.156 --> 16:31.491
Just wanted

16:30.156 --> 16:31.491
to let you know

16:31.491 --> 16:33.618
that Mr. Solano confirmed

16:31.491 --> 16:33.618
your alibi.

16:33.618 --> 16:36.078
Oh. Good.

16:36.078 --> 16:38.164
What did he say exactly?

16:38.164 --> 16:39.833
That you were together.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.167
Yeah, I know, but I-I mean,

16:41.167 --> 16:43.336
did, did he seem happy

16:41.167 --> 16:43.336
about it or...

16:43.336 --> 16:44.545
Ma'am?

16:43.336 --> 16:44.545
Never mind.

16:44.545 --> 16:45.839
Is that all?

16:45.839 --> 16:47.131
No, actually.

16:47.131 --> 16:48.424
We thought you could help us

16:48.424 --> 16:49.926
take a look at

16:48.424 --> 16:49.926
some security footage.

16:49.926 --> 16:51.427
See if anything looks unusual.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.513
We need to review

16:51.427 --> 16:53.513
the hour before the shooting.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.734
Ahem, sorry, I just, uh,

17:06.734 --> 17:09.195
I didn't realize it was going

17:06.734 --> 17:09.195
to take so much time.

17:10.822 --> 17:12.198
You know what?

17:12.198 --> 17:13.867
I should really

17:12.198 --> 17:13.867
visit my sister

17:13.867 --> 17:15.159
before I buckle in here.

17:15.159 --> 17:16.202
Excuse me?

17:16.202 --> 17:17.328
Oh, she's in the hospital.

17:17.328 --> 17:18.538
( whispering ):

17:17.328 --> 17:18.538
A stroke.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.623
Oh.

Triggered by

17:18.538 --> 17:20.623
a severe seizure.

17:20.623 --> 17:22.625
And, uh,

17:20.623 --> 17:22.625
now she's unable to move.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.627
It's called

17:22.625 --> 17:24.627
"locked-in syndrome."

17:24.627 --> 17:26.504
Jeez, that's terrible.

17:24.627 --> 17:26.504
I know.

17:26.504 --> 17:27.714
Awful.

17:29.173 --> 17:31.300
Unfortunately, this

17:29.173 --> 17:31.300
investigation is time-sensitive,

17:31.300 --> 17:32.677

17:31.300 --> 17:32.677

18:08.254 --> 18:10.757
I was gonna ask you.

18:10.757 --> 18:11.758
Why don't I just do it?

18:11.758 --> 18:13.092
Oh, I don't mind.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.719
It has to be right.

<i>Rogelio de la Vega</i>

18:52.006 --> 18:53.507
retweeted an Amber Alert

18:53.507 --> 18:56.094
that his grandchild

18:53.507 --> 18:56.094
was kidnapped.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.307
Please.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.307
I'll do anything.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.183
Yeah?

19:03.183 --> 19:04.602
For reals?

19:04.602 --> 19:06.479
For reals.

19:09.941 --> 19:12.443
NARRATOR:

19:09.941 --> 19:12.443
<i>Okay, where were we?</i>

19:14.654 --> 19:16.614
<i>Ah, yes. Waiting.</i>

19:16.614 --> 19:18.240
<i>Still waiting.</i>

19:18.240 --> 19:20.034
I don't know how you can eat

19:18.240 --> 19:20.034
at a time like this.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.370
I just, uh...

19:23.370 --> 19:24.747
Sorry.

19:24.747 --> 19:26.165
PATRICIA:

19:24.747 --> 19:26.165
Oh, don't be dramatic.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.333
Just eat it.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.002
Listen, we're all upset,

19:27.333 --> 19:29.002
okay?

19:29.002 --> 19:30.503
Don't take it out on Jane.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.254
I'm not taking it out on Jane.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.254
Mom, it's fine.

19:32.254 --> 19:33.798
Let's just go outside

19:32.254 --> 19:33.798
for a minute.

19:33.798 --> 19:36.383
Please?

19:36.383 --> 19:39.345
I'm sorry, but she's being

19:36.383 --> 19:39.345
so rude to you.

19:39.345 --> 19:40.596
She's just scared.

19:40.596 --> 19:42.056
And th-- And this

19:40.596 --> 19:42.056
is how she copes.

19:42.056 --> 19:44.058
But...

19:42.056 --> 19:44.058
Mom. You're not helping.

19:44.058 --> 19:47.061
Just...take a little walk

19:47.061 --> 19:48.938
and cool off, okay, please?

19:52.608 --> 19:54.986
( exhales )

19:52.608 --> 19:54.986
XIOMARA:<i> So this is my fault?</i>

19:54.986 --> 19:56.154
Kind of.

19:56.154 --> 19:57.363
You told me to lie.

19:57.363 --> 19:58.781
Oh, stop.

19:58.781 --> 20:00.199
Sam will get over it

20:00.199 --> 20:01.951
if he's your happily

20:00.199 --> 20:01.951
ever after or whatever.

20:01.951 --> 20:03.786
Maybe.

20:05.329 --> 20:06.706
What?

20:05.329 --> 20:06.706
I don't know.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.248
It was a weird date.

20:08.248 --> 20:09.667
And I don't know

20:08.248 --> 20:09.667
if it was weird

20:09.667 --> 20:11.293
because there was

20:09.667 --> 20:11.293
17 months of buildup,

20:11.293 --> 20:13.295
or because of that cop

20:11.293 --> 20:13.295
and his stupid soup.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.381
Oh...

20:15.381 --> 20:17.591
( laughs )

20:15.381 --> 20:17.591
What?

20:17.591 --> 20:19.927
You like the cop.

20:17.591 --> 20:19.927
No.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.470
No, I don't.

20:21.470 --> 20:23.890
Mm-hmm.

20:21.470 --> 20:23.890
I mean,

20:21.470 --> 20:23.890
he's kind of stalkerish, right?

20:23.890 --> 20:25.641
And his choices in music

20:23.890 --> 20:25.641
are way off.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.434
And he's a cat person.

20:27.434 --> 20:30.229
His profile picture

20:27.434 --> 20:30.229
is him with his cat.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.605
Weird, right?

20:31.605 --> 20:34.233
You are on his Facebook page.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.776
I know.

20:35.776 --> 20:38.237
It's just...

20:35.776 --> 20:38.237
this stupid soup is so good.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.989
( laughs )

20:39.989 --> 20:41.574
Fakes left.

20:39.989 --> 20:41.574
He goes right!

20:41.574 --> 20:43.159
Oh!

20:41.574 --> 20:43.159
( laughs )

20:43.159 --> 20:44.869
( groans )

20:43.159 --> 20:44.869
Game over!

20:43.159 --> 20:44.869
An unprecedented third

20:44.869 --> 20:46.370
consecutive

20:44.869 --> 20:46.370
trash ball championship!

20:46.370 --> 20:48.039
Oh, you got so lucky.

20:46.370 --> 20:48.039
Lucky?

20:48.039 --> 20:49.665
Three championships

20:48.039 --> 20:49.665
is not lucky, my friend.

20:49.665 --> 20:51.000
Whoop.. oh!

20:49.665 --> 20:51.000
Michael...

20:51.000 --> 20:52.793
Hi.

20:52.793 --> 20:54.795
Three championships.

20:52.793 --> 20:54.795
Yeah. Four,

20:54.795 --> 20:56.714
and I get to wear

20:54.795 --> 20:56.714
a crown around the station.

20:56.714 --> 20:59.133
Apology cubano.

20:59.133 --> 21:02.970
I didn't make it,

20:59.133 --> 21:02.970
but still...

21:05.681 --> 21:07.600
I obviously didn't

21:05.681 --> 21:07.600
have a cold,

21:07.600 --> 21:11.395
and I shouldn't have

21:07.600 --> 21:11.395
lied about it.

21:11.395 --> 21:12.897
But I was wondering

21:11.395 --> 21:12.897
if we can go back

21:12.897 --> 21:14.023
to the other night.

21:14.023 --> 21:17.193
I-I mean, not when

21:14.023 --> 21:17.193
I shot your gun,

21:17.193 --> 21:20.320
but...how we felt

21:17.193 --> 21:20.320
when we kissed.

21:20.320 --> 21:22.489
ARMSTRONG:

21:20.320 --> 21:22.489
You kissed

21:20.320 --> 21:22.489
while on duty?

21:22.489 --> 21:24.283
No.

21:22.489 --> 21:24.283
It wasn't until

21:22.489 --> 21:24.283
hours later.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.577
You were at her house

21:24.283 --> 21:26.577
for hours?

21:26.577 --> 21:27.870
My office, Cordero.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.794
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean

21:32.625 --> 21:34.794
to get you in trouble.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.129
No, it's fine,

21:34.794 --> 21:36.129
I just obviously

21:36.129 --> 21:37.630
didn't put the kiss

21:36.129 --> 21:37.630
in the report.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.298
Might have spiced up

21:37.630 --> 21:39.298
the report.

21:40.549 --> 21:42.635
So, before we were

21:40.549 --> 21:42.635
interrupted,

21:42.635 --> 21:44.011
you were saying

21:42.635 --> 21:44.011
something about

21:44.011 --> 21:46.346
trying this again.

21:44.011 --> 21:46.346
I would like that.

21:46.346 --> 21:48.641
Me, too.

21:46.346 --> 21:48.641
And no more lies.

21:46.346 --> 21:48.641
Total honesty.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.517
Perfect.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.517
Which is why

21:48.641 --> 21:50.517
I want you to know

21:50.517 --> 21:51.894
that I'm also going to be

21:51.894 --> 21:53.813
exploring my

21:51.894 --> 21:53.813
relationship with Sam.

21:53.813 --> 21:56.023
What?

21:53.813 --> 21:56.023
The guy that you pulled over.

21:56.023 --> 21:58.025
It's just, I've been in love

21:56.023 --> 21:58.025
with him for 17 months.

21:58.025 --> 21:59.777
I mean, not in love

21:58.025 --> 21:59.777
with him, just, like,

21:59.777 --> 22:02.238
super into him, and

21:59.777 --> 22:02.238
he finally asked me out.

22:02.238 --> 22:03.322
You gotta be kidding me.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.158
I'm just trying

22:03.322 --> 22:05.158
to be honest.

22:05.158 --> 22:06.951
Okay, let me be honest.

22:05.158 --> 22:06.951
I'm not interested

22:06.951 --> 22:09.162
in being in a love triangle

22:06.951 --> 22:09.162
with you and Sam.

22:09.162 --> 22:11.289
It's not a love triangle.

22:09.162 --> 22:11.289
I hardly know you.

22:11.289 --> 22:12.706
Exactly. I don't even know

22:11.289 --> 22:12.706
if I like you.

22:12.706 --> 22:14.208
Well, then, why did you

22:12.706 --> 22:14.208
bring me soup?

22:14.208 --> 22:15.542
I don't know.

22:14.208 --> 22:15.542
I wish I didn't.

22:15.542 --> 22:16.961
You know what?

22:15.542 --> 22:16.961
Have a nice life

22:16.961 --> 22:18.337
with Sam, the lawbreaker.

22:18.337 --> 22:19.797
Well, you have a good life

22:18.337 --> 22:19.797
with your cat!

22:19.797 --> 22:22.049
How do you know

22:19.797 --> 22:22.049
about my cat?

22:22.049 --> 22:24.218
Your profile picture, weirdo.

22:22.049 --> 22:24.218
That's 'cause she just died.

22:24.218 --> 22:26.304
Thanks for bringing

22:24.218 --> 22:26.304
that up, jackass!

22:26.304 --> 22:27.847
Okay, sorry about

22:26.304 --> 22:27.847
your cat,

22:27.847 --> 22:31.058
but you don't have to

22:27.847 --> 22:31.058
call me a jackass...dick!

22:31.058 --> 22:33.144
NARRATOR:

22:31.058 --> 22:33.144
<i>And, friends, in that moment,</i>

22:33.144 --> 22:36.105
<i>Jane truly thought</i>

22:33.144 --> 22:36.105
<i>she'd never see Michael again.</i>

22:37.857 --> 22:41.568
NARRATOR:

22:37.857 --> 22:41.568
<i>Which is obviously</i>

22:37.857 --> 22:41.568
<i>not what happened.</i>

22:41.568 --> 22:43.237
( elevator bell dings )

22:44.238 --> 22:46.406
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

23:09.013 --> 23:11.265
( exhales sharply, sobbing )

23:26.697 --> 23:30.951
NARRATOR:

23:26.697 --> 23:30.951
<i>Okay, so, here we are.</i>

23:32.912 --> 23:34.496
<i>So close...</i>

23:34.496 --> 23:36.207
Hey, again, just

23:34.496 --> 23:36.207
checking your vitals.

23:37.375 --> 23:38.709
Everything looks the same.

23:38.709 --> 23:42.338
But...here's a call

23:38.709 --> 23:42.338
button just in case.

23:42.338 --> 23:43.839
NARRATOR:

23:42.338 --> 23:43.839
<i>...and yet so far.</i>

23:43.839 --> 23:47.343
<i>At least for two hours</i>

23:43.839 --> 23:47.343
<i>and 23 minutes.</i>

23:47.343 --> 23:49.427
If I might say, you seem

23:47.343 --> 23:49.427
a little nervous, ma'am.

23:49.427 --> 23:51.847
NARRATOR:

23:49.427 --> 23:51.847
<i>Well, she did have</i>

23:49.427 --> 23:51.847
<i>a ticking cluck.</i>

23:51.847 --> 23:53.099
( chicken clucking )

23:53.099 --> 23:54.308
No, not nervous.

23:53.099 --> 23:54.308
( sighs )

23:54.308 --> 23:56.352
I just need

23:54.308 --> 23:56.352
to use the restroom.

23:57.895 --> 24:00.064
I'll be right back.

24:06.195 --> 24:08.614
Heard they found a trail

24:06.195 --> 24:08.614
of white powder in the hallway.

24:08.614 --> 24:10.199
They're running tests.

24:10.199 --> 24:13.244
Yep. You know,

24:10.199 --> 24:13.244
if it's cocaine,

24:13.244 --> 24:15.204
this could be some

24:13.244 --> 24:15.204
kind of drug thing.

24:29.802 --> 24:32.512
NARRATOR:

24:29.802 --> 24:32.512
<i>Uh-oh, friends,</i>

24:29.802 --> 24:32.512
<i>I believe Anezka,</i>

24:32.512 --> 24:34.807
<i>like her sister,</i>

24:32.512 --> 24:34.807
<i>is locked in.</i>

24:34.807 --> 24:36.309
<i>Hmm. That's suspicious.</i>

24:36.309 --> 24:37.684
ANEZKA:

24:36.309 --> 24:37.684
<i>Come on!</i>

24:37.684 --> 24:39.353
NARRATOR:

24:37.684 --> 24:39.353
<i>Also rather suspicious...</i>

24:39.353 --> 24:40.562
Hey.

24:39.353 --> 24:40.562
Oh, yeah.

24:40.562 --> 24:41.855
What?

24:41.855 --> 24:44.275
Sorry.

24:41.855 --> 24:44.275
You scared me.

24:44.275 --> 24:45.567
I'm just getting

24:44.275 --> 24:45.567
some air.

24:45.567 --> 24:46.902
Yeah, me too.

24:48.779 --> 24:50.488
Rogelio.

24:48.779 --> 24:50.488
What?

24:50.488 --> 24:52.074
Let me get a sip

24:50.488 --> 24:52.074
of your coffee.

24:52.074 --> 24:53.909
No. No, no!

24:53.909 --> 24:56.078
No, no.

24:53.909 --> 24:56.078
Wh...

24:56.078 --> 24:58.122
Is that urine?

24:58.122 --> 25:00.624
No.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.210
Yes.

25:04.711 --> 25:06.380
I made a deal

25:04.711 --> 25:06.380
to give my pee

25:06.380 --> 25:09.675
to two tweakers so they

25:06.380 --> 25:09.675
could pass a drug test.

25:09.675 --> 25:11.844
In exchange, they agreed

25:09.675 --> 25:11.844
not to tweet pictures

25:11.844 --> 25:13.595
of me at the hospital.

25:13.595 --> 25:16.723
I'm pretty sure that's<i> illegal.</i>

25:13.595 --> 25:16.723
I don't care.

25:16.723 --> 25:19.893
A tweet from me almost

25:16.723 --> 25:19.893
ruined Jane's life last year.

25:19.893 --> 25:21.561
I'm not going to

25:19.893 --> 25:21.561
let that happen again.

25:21.561 --> 25:23.689
I have to do something

25:21.561 --> 25:23.689
for her.

25:23.689 --> 25:25.816
And for Michael.

25:25.816 --> 25:28.068
Oh, Ro...

25:28.068 --> 25:30.737
Sorry... Sorry...

25:30.737 --> 25:32.823
It's... It's just...

25:32.823 --> 25:35.701
You know how I always say

25:32.823 --> 25:35.701
he's my best friend?

25:35.701 --> 25:37.411
Well, I mean it.

25:38.078 --> 25:39.537
So, you got it?

25:39.537 --> 25:41.415
I just need a little

25:39.537 --> 25:41.415
more time to hydrate.

25:41.415 --> 25:44.168
Please. I promise,

25:41.415 --> 25:44.168
you'll get what you need.

25:44.168 --> 25:46.128
Twenty minutes.

25:49.589 --> 25:50.590
I'll do it.

25:50.590 --> 25:52.218
I want to help too.

25:52.218 --> 25:53.844
So I'll pee

25:52.218 --> 25:53.844
in a damn cup.

25:53.844 --> 25:56.096
Great. Perfect.

25:56.096 --> 25:57.555
NARRATOR:

25:56.096 --> 25:57.555
<i>And that's when she remembered</i>

25:57.555 --> 25:59.808
<i>she'd recently peed</i>

25:57.555 --> 25:59.808
<i>on a damn stick.</i>

25:59.808 --> 26:02.895
Actually,

25:59.808 --> 26:02.895
forget it, um...

26:02.895 --> 26:04.230
I'm a woman, so...

26:04.230 --> 26:06.315
They can't tell gender.

26:04.230 --> 26:06.315
Yes, they can.

26:06.315 --> 26:07.774
No, they can't.

26:06.315 --> 26:07.774
Yes, they can.

26:07.774 --> 26:10.403
They can't.

26:07.774 --> 26:10.403
Sometimes they can!

26:11.945 --> 26:15.408
Like...when you're

26:11.945 --> 26:15.408
pregnant, for instance.

26:16.367 --> 26:19.119
Pregnant?

26:19.119 --> 26:20.246
It's Esteban's.

26:30.172 --> 26:33.384
Hey. I'm sorry

26:30.172 --> 26:33.384
about my mom.

26:33.384 --> 26:36.178
Well, hopefully she got

26:33.384 --> 26:36.178
ahold of herself.

26:40.598 --> 26:42.351
Hi.

26:42.351 --> 26:45.687
So the good news is

26:42.351 --> 26:45.687
that he's stabilized.

26:45.687 --> 26:48.815
Oh...

26:45.687 --> 26:48.815
We were able to

26:45.687 --> 26:48.815
get him into imaging,

26:48.815 --> 26:50.984
and the CT scan showed that

26:48.815 --> 26:50.984
he had an aortic dissection,

26:50.984 --> 26:52.694
which we can

26:50.984 --> 26:52.694
manage medically.

26:52.694 --> 26:53.904
Okay, good.

26:52.694 --> 26:53.904
That's good.

26:53.904 --> 26:55.489
DOCTOR:

26:53.904 --> 26:55.489
But the problem is

26:55.489 --> 26:57.533
the bullet passed

26:55.489 --> 26:57.533
through the chest cavity,

26:57.533 --> 26:58.951
and landed near his spine.

26:58.951 --> 27:01.619
Right now there is

26:58.951 --> 27:01.619
considerable swelling.

27:01.619 --> 27:02.829
W-What does that mean?

27:02.829 --> 27:05.124
Well, there are

27:02.829 --> 27:05.124
two options.

27:05.124 --> 27:06.624
Neither's perfect.

27:06.624 --> 27:08.335
We can take

27:06.624 --> 27:08.335
a wait-and-see approach,

27:08.335 --> 27:10.463
treat him with steroids,

27:08.335 --> 27:10.463
see if it works.

27:10.463 --> 27:13.382
But if it doesn't,

27:10.463 --> 27:13.382
he risks loss of function.

27:13.382 --> 27:15.593
Possibly from the waist down.

27:17.136 --> 27:18.762
Or we could try

27:17.136 --> 27:18.762
to operate,

27:18.762 --> 27:20.806
to clear the bone fragments

27:18.762 --> 27:20.806
and relieve the pressure

27:20.806 --> 27:22.349
on his spinal cord.

27:22.349 --> 27:24.935
This offers slightly better

27:22.349 --> 27:24.935
odds on the paralysis front,

27:24.935 --> 27:27.396
but he's in

27:24.935 --> 27:27.396
critical condition,

27:27.396 --> 27:29.106
and surgery comes

27:27.396 --> 27:29.106
with real risks.

27:29.106 --> 27:30.690
Then no,

27:29.106 --> 27:30.690
we're not doing it.

27:30.690 --> 27:32.818
You can take some time

27:30.690 --> 27:32.818
to discuss it.

27:32.818 --> 27:34.194
I'm sure.

27:35.862 --> 27:37.239
You're his wife,

27:35.862 --> 27:37.239
so, technically,

27:37.239 --> 27:38.991
it's your decision.

27:40.951 --> 27:44.079
I-I'd like a few minutes

27:40.951 --> 27:44.079
to think about it.

27:50.710 --> 27:53.339
You want to risk his life,

27:50.710 --> 27:53.339
after all this?

27:53.339 --> 27:56.800
I-I don't know, I thought

27:53.339 --> 27:56.800
that we should talk.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.970
I...need to talk

27:56.800 --> 27:59.970
to his father.

27:59.970 --> 28:02.181
I know he's close

27:59.970 --> 28:02.181
and I'm pretty sure

28:02.181 --> 28:03.849
he'll agree with me.

28:10.856 --> 28:13.526
( in Spanish ):

28:10.856 --> 28:13.526
What do you think?

28:16.362 --> 28:18.780
I think...

28:18.780 --> 28:21.908
that this wasn't

28:18.780 --> 28:21.908
supposed to happen.

28:21.908 --> 28:23.785
We talked about who

28:21.908 --> 28:23.785
would take out the trash

28:23.785 --> 28:25.663
and when we would have

28:23.785 --> 28:25.663
another baby,

28:25.663 --> 28:27.206
not what I should do

28:25.663 --> 28:27.206
if there was a bullet

28:27.206 --> 28:29.082
near his spine.

28:32.294 --> 28:34.921
I don't know what

28:32.294 --> 28:34.921
the right answer is.

28:34.921 --> 28:38.133
There isn't

28:34.921 --> 28:38.133
a right answer.

28:39.385 --> 28:42.137
Only what Michael

28:39.385 --> 28:42.137
would do.

28:44.181 --> 28:46.183
And you are his wife.

28:46.183 --> 28:50.270
You know him better

28:46.183 --> 28:50.270
than anyone.

28:50.270 --> 28:54.191
Just think about

28:50.270 --> 28:54.191
Michael...

28:54.191 --> 28:56.068
NARRATOR:

28:54.191 --> 28:56.068
<i>And, friends,</i>

28:56.068 --> 28:58.111
<i>that's when Jane remembered</i>

28:56.068 --> 28:58.111
<i>this moment.</i>

28:58.111 --> 29:00.322
( doorbell rings )

29:00.322 --> 29:02.991
<i>Which, of course,</i>

29:00.322 --> 29:02.991
<i>is where we left off.</i>

29:02.991 --> 29:04.117
What are you doing here?

29:04.117 --> 29:05.202
Well, firstly,

29:05.202 --> 29:06.286
I wanted to apologize

29:06.286 --> 29:07.496
for calling you

29:06.286 --> 29:07.496
a jackass.

29:07.496 --> 29:09.665
And I thought about it,

29:09.665 --> 29:11.584
and who cares about Sam?

29:11.584 --> 29:13.377
Sam can come on our dates

29:11.584 --> 29:13.377
if you want him to.

29:13.377 --> 29:14.712
Michael, stop.

29:14.712 --> 29:16.630
It's fine. Just go.

29:16.630 --> 29:18.298
Seriously.

29:18.298 --> 29:20.342
We had one good night,

29:18.298 --> 29:20.342
and I was wasted.

29:20.342 --> 29:22.844
And our sober interactions

29:20.342 --> 29:22.844
have been pretty terrible.

29:23.929 --> 29:25.847
If you really mean that--

29:25.847 --> 29:27.725
If you really want me

29:25.847 --> 29:27.725
to walk away--

29:27.725 --> 29:31.019
Say the words...

29:27.725 --> 29:31.019
I will.

29:31.019 --> 29:32.938
Walk away.

29:36.525 --> 29:38.068
No.

29:38.068 --> 29:39.945
What are you doing?

29:39.945 --> 29:41.655
We had something.

29:41.655 --> 29:43.490
That kiss was magic.

29:43.490 --> 29:47.035
NARRATOR:

29:43.490 --> 29:47.035
<i>There's that word again.</i>

29:47.035 --> 29:48.621
The magic of tequila.

29:48.621 --> 29:51.123
Let me kiss you again.

29:48.621 --> 29:51.123
Sober.

29:52.958 --> 29:54.293
Why won't you give up?

29:54.293 --> 29:56.086
Because I'm a fighter.

29:56.086 --> 29:57.504
You should know that

29:56.086 --> 29:57.504
about me.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.299
I'm a fighter.

30:05.387 --> 30:06.722
He'd want the surgery.

30:06.722 --> 30:10.934
Yes, that's what

30:06.722 --> 30:10.934
his father said too.

30:12.936 --> 30:15.397
I'm just so scared.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.275
Me too.

30:22.112 --> 30:26.074
So you just have a few minutes

30:22.112 --> 30:26.074
while the O.R.'s being prepped.

30:37.127 --> 30:39.254
( monitor beeping )

30:40.922 --> 30:42.591
Hi.

30:43.883 --> 30:47.429
So you're about

30:43.883 --> 30:47.429
to have surgery.

30:47.429 --> 30:49.014
But I'm not gonna

30:47.429 --> 30:49.014
say good-bye,

30:49.014 --> 30:51.809
because this is not

30:49.014 --> 30:51.809
the end of our story.

30:53.393 --> 30:56.438
Do you hear me, Michael?

30:56.438 --> 30:59.441
You're gonna wake up,

30:56.438 --> 30:59.441
and you're gonna be okay.

31:00.900 --> 31:02.944
<i>And we're gonna move</i>

31:00.900 --> 31:02.944
<i>into our new house.</i>

31:02.944 --> 31:05.238
<i>And we're gonna live there</i>

31:02.944 --> 31:05.238
<i>until we outgrow it.</i>

31:06.323 --> 31:08.950
<i>Because I'll be pregnant...</i>

31:08.950 --> 31:10.494
<i>with our third kid,</i>

31:10.494 --> 31:13.121
<i>because we landed on three</i>

31:10.494 --> 31:13.121
<i>the other night--</i>

31:13.121 --> 31:14.748
Three kids total.

31:14.748 --> 31:16.709
<i>Which will seem overwhelming,</i>

31:16.709 --> 31:19.169
<i>but Mateo's such</i>

31:16.709 --> 31:19.169
<i>a big help.</i>

31:19.169 --> 31:21.421
Oh, and we're gonna go

31:19.169 --> 31:21.421
to the mountains.

31:21.421 --> 31:22.881
We're gonna take 'em

31:21.421 --> 31:22.881
to the mountains

31:22.881 --> 31:26.301
because we always wanted

31:22.881 --> 31:26.301
to be in the snow.

31:26.301 --> 31:27.469
( kids laughing )

31:27.469 --> 31:28.970
<i>And then we'll go every year.</i>

31:28.970 --> 31:31.431
<i>And-and that trip will become</i>

31:28.970 --> 31:31.431
<i>a tradition.</i>

31:31.431 --> 31:34.351
We're huge on family traditions,

31:31.431 --> 31:34.351
by the way.

31:34.351 --> 31:36.395
<i>Christmas, Easter,</i>

31:36.395 --> 31:39.189
<i>Sunday night family dinners.</i>

31:39.189 --> 31:42.359
<i>And even when the kids move out</i>

31:39.189 --> 31:42.359
<i>and have families of their own,</i>

31:42.359 --> 31:46.029
they'll always come back

31:42.359 --> 31:46.029
for Sunday night dinners.

31:46.029 --> 31:47.447
Mateo?

31:47.447 --> 31:49.199
<i>Partly because</i>

31:47.447 --> 31:49.199
<i>they want to see us,</i>

31:49.199 --> 31:52.202
<i>but partly because</i>

31:49.199 --> 31:52.202
<i>you're such a great griller.</i>

31:52.202 --> 31:54.287
( sniffles ):

31:52.202 --> 31:54.287
You're a really

31:54.287 --> 31:56.998
great griller, Michael.

31:56.998 --> 31:58.709
<i>And we're gonna be</i>

31:56.998 --> 31:58.709
<i>that old couple</i>

31:58.709 --> 32:00.085
<i>that sit on the front porch.</i>

32:00.085 --> 32:04.214
<i>reminiscing,</i>

32:00.085 --> 32:04.214
<i>arguing over details.</i>

32:04.214 --> 32:06.550
I thought it was

32:04.214 --> 32:06.550
a broken taillight.

32:06.550 --> 32:10.303
No, it was

32:06.550 --> 32:10.303
an illegal U-turn.

32:10.303 --> 32:11.597
And we'll get a stupid cat,

32:11.597 --> 32:12.806
<i>'cause, yes,</i>

32:12.806 --> 32:14.850
<i>you convinced me to get one.</i>

32:14.850 --> 32:17.811
<i>And we're gonna be happy,</i>

32:14.850 --> 32:17.811
<i>Michael.</i>

32:17.811 --> 32:20.021
We're gonna be happy.

32:20.021 --> 32:23.358
Okay, it's time.

32:23.358 --> 32:24.735
Mm-hm.

32:23.358 --> 32:24.735
( sniffles )

32:31.742 --> 32:34.870
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

( indistinct announcement

32:38.331 --> 32:41.460
over intercom )

32:44.045 --> 32:46.005
We wanted to come.

32:46.005 --> 32:47.549
For support.

NARRATOR:

32:50.135 --> 32:53.179
<i>At this moment,</i>

32:50.135 --> 32:53.179

Yeah, well, uh...

33:02.773 --> 33:03.941
<i>At least, Petra knew.</i>

33:03.941 --> 33:05.692
...I'm upset.

33:05.692 --> 33:07.611
And I, I know

33:07.611 --> 33:09.237
Michael was shot

33:07.611 --> 33:09.237
and everyone's scared.

33:09.237 --> 33:10.697
But my sister had a stroke.

33:10.697 --> 33:12.449
And now she's lying there

33:10.697 --> 33:12.449
in some hospital bed

33:12.449 --> 33:13.992
all by herself

33:12.449 --> 33:13.992
and she must be so scared,

33:13.992 --> 33:15.619
and I just want to see her.

33:15.619 --> 33:18.121
I need to see her.

33:18.121 --> 33:20.624
Of course you do.

( sighs ):

33:20.624 --> 33:21.792
I'm sorry.

33:25.003 --> 33:27.965
Look, just, I'll look

33:25.003 --> 33:27.965
through the security footage.

33:27.965 --> 33:29.174
Let her go to the hospital.

33:29.174 --> 33:30.592
I don't know.

33:30.592 --> 33:32.302
She's been acting

33:30.592 --> 33:32.302
pretty suspicious.

33:32.302 --> 33:34.262
Well, you know

33:32.302 --> 33:34.262
she was with me last night.

33:34.262 --> 33:36.222
So she's not a suspect.

33:36.222 --> 33:39.601
Unless you want me to get

33:36.222 --> 33:39.601

33:53.490 --> 33:54.741
<i>Cordero's still in surgery.</i>

33:57.577 --> 33:59.037
So, you can go now.

33:57.577 --> 33:59.037
No problem

33:59.037 --> 34:01.247
for me to stay

33:59.037 --> 34:01.247

34:04.209 --> 34:07.546

34:44.082 --> 34:46.125

35:01.934 --> 35:03.476
The surgery went well.

35:03.476 --> 35:05.228
( sighs of relief )

35:03.476 --> 35:05.228
We got the bullet fragments

35:05.228 --> 35:06.646
and he's already

35:05.228 --> 35:06.646
showing signs

35:06.646 --> 35:07.898
of movement in his lower body.

35:18.366 --> 35:21.369

35:43.182 --> 35:46.061
Oh, my God!

35:43.182 --> 35:46.061
Oh, my God, I hate you!

35:46.061 --> 35:48.146
I love you, I love you.

35:48.146 --> 35:51.190
I love you so much.

35:59.532 --> 36:00.951
So?

35:59.532 --> 36:00.951
Mm-hmm?

36:00.951 --> 36:02.160
What's this about you

36:02.160 --> 36:03.870
promising me a cat

36:02.160 --> 36:03.870
if I woke up?

36:03.870 --> 36:05.163
You heard?

36:03.870 --> 36:05.163
Nah.

36:05.163 --> 36:06.205
The nurse told me.

36:06.205 --> 36:07.833
But I'm psyched.

36:07.833 --> 36:10.752
Yeah, you're not really

36:07.833 --> 36:10.752
getting one.

36:07.833 --> 36:10.752
What?

36:10.752 --> 36:13.130
You're gonna go back on

36:10.752 --> 36:13.130
a deathbed promise?

36:10.752 --> 36:13.130
Come on!

36:13.130 --> 36:14.840
Are you serious?

36:13.130 --> 36:14.840
Yeah, definitely.

36:14.840 --> 36:15.882
I want my cat.

36:15.882 --> 36:19.552
Faith M. Whiskers...III.

36:24.516 --> 36:25.934
<i>Actually, screw the rules.</i>

36:25.934 --> 36:27.435
<i>Let's jump ahead</i>

36:29.187 --> 36:31.356
<i>She's so freakin' adorable.</i>

36:33.900 --> 36:35.443
We'll talk about it later.

36:35.443 --> 36:37.195
There's nothing to talk about.

36:35.443 --> 36:37.195
I'm getting my cat.

36:37.195 --> 36:40.032
NARRATOR:

36:37.195 --> 36:40.032
<i>Ah, if this were only</i>

36:37.195 --> 36:40.032
<i>a romance novel.</i>

36:40.032 --> 36:41.324
<i>We could end here</i>

36:41.324 --> 36:43.827
<i>and they'd get their HEA.</i>

36:45.370 --> 36:47.288
( knocking )

36:47.288 --> 36:49.248
<i>But, alas, this isn't</i>

36:47.288 --> 36:49.248
<i>a romance novel.</i>

36:49.248 --> 36:51.084
So listen,

36:49.248 --> 36:51.084
I don't want to interrupt,

36:51.084 --> 36:53.461
but we should really talk

36:51.084 --> 36:53.461
now that you're up,

36:53.461 --> 36:55.380
in case you remember anything

36:53.461 --> 36:55.380
about the shooting.

36:55.380 --> 36:57.132
Absolutely.

36:55.380 --> 36:57.132
I remember everything.

36:57.132 --> 36:59.718
NARRATOR:

36:57.132 --> 36:59.718
<i>It's a telenovela, remember?</i>

36:59.718 --> 37:02.220
It was my partner.

37:02.220 --> 37:03.930
Susanna Barnett.

37:03.930 --> 37:07.184
<i>And we're right smack</i>

37:03.930 --> 37:07.184
<i>in the middle.</i>

37:07.184 --> 37:09.811
And I just think

37:07.184 --> 37:09.811
if I move my sister here,

37:09.811 --> 37:11.188
then I-I'll be able to...

37:11.188 --> 37:12.522
NARRATOR:

37:11.188 --> 37:12.522
<i>Keep her paralyzed?</i>

37:12.522 --> 37:13.940
...take care of her.

37:13.940 --> 37:16.234
Talk to her

37:13.940 --> 37:16.234
so she won't be so lonely.

37:16.234 --> 37:19.154
That sounds like

37:16.234 --> 37:19.154
a great idea.

37:19.154 --> 37:20.572
Thank you.

37:20.572 --> 37:22.157
Well, for everything.

37:22.157 --> 37:24.743
Without you, I would've...

37:24.743 --> 37:26.327
broken down.

37:26.327 --> 37:27.954
Today.

37:27.954 --> 37:31.374
Last night.

37:31.374 --> 37:33.126
Yeah, um, I actually wanted

37:33.126 --> 37:35.170
to talk to you

37:33.126 --> 37:35.170
about last night.

37:35.170 --> 37:38.548
You don't regret it,

37:35.170 --> 37:38.548
do you?

37:38.548 --> 37:39.883
No.

37:39.883 --> 37:41.843
Because I always

37:39.883 --> 37:41.843
wondered if,

37:41.843 --> 37:43.344
uh, you know,

37:41.843 --> 37:43.344
that thing that we had,

37:43.344 --> 37:44.596
if it was still there.

37:44.596 --> 37:46.681
You know?

37:46.681 --> 37:49.350
And it just wasn't.

37:49.350 --> 37:51.436
What?

37:51.436 --> 37:52.687
I'm sorry.

37:52.687 --> 37:54.147
I just,

37:52.687 --> 37:54.147
I want to be honest.

37:54.147 --> 37:55.732
You've told me

37:54.147 --> 37:55.732
to be honest.

37:55.732 --> 37:57.817
But things

37:55.732 --> 37:57.817
just felt different.

37:57.817 --> 37:59.903
NARRATOR:

37:57.817 --> 37:59.903
<i>Because it wasn't Petra!</i>

37:59.903 --> 38:01.988
So I'm glad

37:59.903 --> 38:01.988
that it happened.

38:01.988 --> 38:04.699
Because now we can move on

38:01.988 --> 38:04.699
to being friends.

38:06.451 --> 38:07.911
Because romantically,

38:07.911 --> 38:11.456
I just don't want

38:07.911 --> 38:11.456
to go there again.

38:11.456 --> 38:13.208
Forget what I say earlier,

38:11.456 --> 38:13.208
Mother.

38:13.208 --> 38:15.835
Rafael part of plan

38:13.208 --> 38:15.835
is on too.

38:15.835 --> 38:17.796
Yeah, no, right...

38:17.796 --> 38:20.298
Well, that's what I mean.

38:30.516 --> 38:32.393
I'm sorry, what

38:30.516 --> 38:32.393
did you call me?

38:32.393 --> 38:34.020
You're Erik Estrada,

38:32.393 --> 38:34.020
right?

38:34.020 --> 38:35.354
Yeah, from<i> CHiPs.</i>

38:35.354 --> 38:37.565
You thought I was

38:35.354 --> 38:37.565
Erik Estrada?

38:37.565 --> 38:39.651
That guy's,

38:37.565 --> 38:39.651
like, 100.

38:39.651 --> 38:41.069
( gasps ):

38:39.651 --> 38:41.069
Oh, my God!

38:41.069 --> 38:42.528
Dude, calm down.

38:41.069 --> 38:42.528
I will not calm down!

38:42.528 --> 38:43.989
There are, like, cops

38:42.528 --> 38:43.989
everywhere, man.

38:43.989 --> 38:45.782
Good.

38:43.989 --> 38:45.782
You should be arrested.

38:45.782 --> 38:47.617
I gave you guys my urine!

38:47.617 --> 38:50.036
And then you make this egregious

38:47.617 --> 38:50.036
racial and generational

38:50.036 --> 38:51.121
mistake!

38:51.121 --> 38:53.206
I hope

38:51.121 --> 38:53.206
you rot in jail.

38:53.206 --> 38:55.041
Did I hear something

38:53.206 --> 38:55.041
about a urine exchange?

39:00.046 --> 39:01.756
Thank you for your help.

39:02.757 --> 39:03.967
A day like this,

39:03.967 --> 39:05.927
it just puts things

39:03.967 --> 39:05.927
in perspective.

39:05.927 --> 39:08.221
So I wanted to say

39:08.221 --> 39:09.889
on the other note,

39:09.889 --> 39:12.433
that, of course,

39:09.889 --> 39:12.433
I'll stand by you

39:12.433 --> 39:13.852
and the baby.

39:12.433 --> 39:13.852
Rogelio.

39:13.852 --> 39:15.895
Stop.

39:15.895 --> 39:18.273
I'm not having the baby.

39:18.273 --> 39:21.567
I didn't want to

39:18.273 --> 39:21.567
have a baby with you,

39:21.567 --> 39:23.903
who I love so much.

39:21.567 --> 39:23.903
( sighs )

39:23.903 --> 39:26.614
I'm not having a baby

39:23.903 --> 39:26.614
with Esteban.

39:26.614 --> 39:29.367
Well, that's your choice.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.995
Either way, I'm here, okay?

39:31.995 --> 39:33.621
Thank you.

39:33.621 --> 39:35.832
I appreciate that.

39:35.832 --> 39:36.791
Yeah.

39:36.791 --> 39:38.084
OFFICER:

39:36.791 --> 39:38.084
Ready to go?

39:38.084 --> 39:40.962
Yes, sir.

39:43.131 --> 39:46.134
I'll see you at the station

39:43.131 --> 39:46.134
in an hour.

39:46.134 --> 39:48.220
You better not be back

39:46.134 --> 39:48.220
to work tomorrow, Cordero.

39:48.220 --> 39:49.637
MICHAEL:

39:48.220 --> 39:49.637
We'll see.

39:49.637 --> 39:51.681
I don't want him

39:49.637 --> 39:51.681

39:58.479 --> 39:59.814
<i>We're here.</i>

39:59.814 --> 40:02.025
So tox came back.

40:02.025 --> 40:03.568
It wasn't cocaine

40:02.025 --> 40:03.568

40:03.568 --> 40:05.486
It was actually

40:03.568 --> 40:05.486
powdered sugar.

40:05.486 --> 40:06.738
Powdered sugar?

40:06.738 --> 40:07.780
Like, from donuts?

40:07.780 --> 40:09.366
A-Anyway, who cares?

40:09.366 --> 40:11.284
It means it was

40:09.366 --> 40:11.284
a dead end.

Unless you know a murderous,

You saved these from your

40:19.084 --> 40:21.044
Okay, first of all,

40:19.084 --> 40:21.044
she's not a psychopath.

40:21.044 --> 40:22.295
She's a sociopath.

I do know one.

Sin Rostro?

40:32.597 --> 40:35.016
But she's dead.

40:35.016 --> 40:38.144
Or someone who was made
