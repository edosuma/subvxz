06:27.453 --> 06:30.022
&gt;&gt; IF IT'S FOR ME, I'M NOT HERE.

06:30.089 --> 06:31.557
&gt;&gt; OH, LULU, MIKEY J CALLED.

06:31.624 --> 06:31.991
HE WANTS YOU

06:32.058 --> 06:32.692
TO MEET HIM AT HIS HOUSE

06:32.759 --> 06:34.026
AT 3:00.

06:34.093 --> 06:35.528
&gt;&gt; WHO'S MIKEY J?

06:35.595 --> 06:36.896
&gt;&gt; MY BOYFRIEND.

06:36.963 --> 06:37.363
&gt;&gt; SOUNDS LIKE

06:37.430 --> 06:41.267
SOMEBODY HAS A BOYFRIEND.

06:41.334 --> 06:42.602
&gt;&gt; I JUST SAID I DID.

06:42.668 --> 06:47.039
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NO MEMORY OF THAT.

06:47.106 --> 06:47.740
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.

06:47.807 --> 06:48.975
&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT MY FAULT, MISS PARK.

06:49.041 --> 06:49.709
THAT LITTLE BUDDY YOU GAVE ME

06:49.776 --> 06:51.911
MADE ME DO IT.

06:51.978 --> 06:55.915
[PHONE RINGS: MUSIC]

06:55.982 --> 07:09.929
&gt;&gt; MISS PARK-- WHAT?

07:09.996 --> 07:11.898
&gt;&gt; SUCKER.

07:11.964 --> 07:12.899
&gt;&gt; WHAT DID YOU DO?

07:12.965 --> 07:13.366
&gt;&gt; I TOLD HER

07:13.432 --> 07:14.200
SOMEONE FILLED HER BACKSEAT

07:14.267 --> 07:16.002
WITH DOG NONSENSE.

07:16.068 --> 07:16.702
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S SHE GONNA DO

07:16.769 --> 07:17.503
WHEN SHE FINDS OUT

07:17.570 --> 07:19.338
YOU WERE LYING?

07:19.405 --> 07:21.541
&gt;&gt; WHO SAID I WAS LYING?

07:21.607 --> 07:22.708
COME ON, LET'S GO.

07:22.775 --> 07:23.242
&gt;&gt; I CAN'T GO.

07:23.309 --> 07:24.544
I'M IN DETENTION.

07:24.610 --> 07:25.745
IT'S NOT OPTIONAL.

07:25.812 --> 07:27.079
&gt;&gt; FINE, I GUESS

07:27.146 --> 07:27.847
WE CAN FIND SOMETHING

07:27.914 --> 07:28.981
TO HAVE FUN WITH HERE.

07:29.048 --> 07:30.616
RIGHT, NUBNUZZLE?

07:30.683 --> 07:31.818
&gt;&gt; STOP CALLING ME THINGS.

07:31.884 --> 07:32.618
AND YOU BETTER GET LOST

07:32.685 --> 07:36.022
BEFORE MISS PARK COMES BACK.

07:36.088 --> 07:36.989
&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:37.056 --> 07:37.490
&gt;&gt; POURING GLUE

07:37.557 --> 07:38.891
ON THAT LADY'S MUG.

07:38.958 --> 07:39.392
&gt;&gt; THAT'S HER

07:39.458 --> 07:40.226
"WORLD'S GREATEST TEACHER" MUG.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.228
SHE LOVES THAT THING.

07:42.295 --> 07:42.728
&gt;&gt; WELL, I HOPE

07:42.795 --> 07:45.932
SHE LIKES DRINKING SIDEWAYS.

07:45.998 --> 07:46.532
&gt;&gt; OKAY, GIVE ME THAT

07:46.599 --> 07:46.999
BEFORE WE GET

07:47.066 --> 07:50.403
IN EVEN MORE TROUBLE.

07:50.469 --> 07:51.537
&gt;&gt; UH-HM.

07:51.604 --> 07:52.705
&gt;&gt; IT WASN'T ME, HE DID IT.

07:52.772 --> 08:06.552
&gt;&gt; HE WHO?

08:06.619 --> 08:09.255
&gt;&gt; HEY LULU, SPECIAL DELIVERY.

08:09.322 --> 08:10.590
IT'S MY FAMOUS TRI-TIP,

08:10.656 --> 08:11.490
AS IN "TRY NOT TO EAT IT

08:11.557 --> 08:13.860
ALL IN ONE BITE."

08:13.926 --> 08:15.161
&gt;&gt; HAVE YOU EVER TRIED

08:15.228 --> 08:16.863
TO RUB SUGAR AND CAYENNE

08:16.929 --> 08:17.864
ON YOUR BRISKET?

08:17.930 --> 08:18.764
THEY DO IT AT ACES HIGH

08:18.831 --> 08:19.966
IN ATLANTIC CITY.

08:20.032 --> 08:21.000
IT'S SWEET AT FIRST,

08:21.067 --> 08:22.168
THEN IT BURNS YOU,

08:22.235 --> 08:23.736
LIKE A RELATIONSHIP.

08:23.803 --> 08:26.839
AM I RIGHT, LADIES?

08:26.906 --> 08:29.141
&gt;&gt; WELL, ENJOY IT.

08:29.208 --> 08:32.378
&gt;&gt; THANKS, IS YOUR DAD SINGLE?

08:32.445 --> 08:34.513
&gt;&gt; YOUR WHAT?

08:34.580 --> 08:37.850
&gt;&gt; LULU.

08:37.917 --> 08:39.352
&gt;&gt; HERE YOU GO.

08:39.418 --> 08:40.553
&gt;&gt; OOH, IT'S PRETTY.

08:40.620 --> 08:41.187
&gt;&gt; THANKS.

08:41.254 --> 08:41.754
&gt;&gt; HOW'S IT GOING

08:41.821 --> 08:42.855
WITH YOUR LITTLE BUDDY?

08:42.922 --> 08:43.656
&gt;&gt; NOT SO GOOD.

08:43.723 --> 08:44.190
SHE HASN'T SAID

08:44.257 --> 08:46.292
MORE THAN 10 WORDS ALL DAY.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.193
I FEEL LIKE I'M NOT MAKING

08:47.260 --> 08:48.895
ANY IMPACT AT ALL.

08:48.961 --> 08:49.862
HOW ABOUT YOU?

08:49.929 --> 08:50.563
&gt;&gt; MY LITTLE BUDDY TAUGHT ME

08:50.630 --> 08:53.499
HOW TO PICK A LOCK.

08:53.566 --> 08:54.033
&gt;&gt; OH, IS IT OKAY

08:54.100 --> 08:54.634
IF I LEAVE EARLY?

08:54.700 --> 08:55.134
MIKEY J WANTS ME

08:55.201 --> 08:56.369
TO COME OVER TO HIS HOUSE.

08:56.435 --> 08:58.304
&gt;&gt; I GUESS SO.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.572
&gt;&gt; YOU OKAY OVER THERE?

08:59.639 --> 09:00.539
&gt;&gt; YES.

09:00.606 --> 09:01.007
&gt;&gt; MY MEETING

09:01.073 --> 09:02.008
SHOULDN'T BE TOO LONG.

09:02.074 --> 09:03.075
YOU CAN PLAY ON MY COMPUTER.

09:03.142 --> 09:03.843
IF YOU CLICK ON THE ICON

09:03.910 --> 09:05.111
MARKED "FINANCIAL REPORTS,"

09:05.177 --> 09:07.113
IT OPENS UP A BUNCH OF GAMES.

09:07.179 --> 09:09.548
&gt;&gt; THANKS.

09:09.615 --> 09:10.616
&gt;&gt; WAIT, I'VE GOT

09:10.683 --> 09:11.851
AN EVEN BETTER IDEA.

09:11.918 --> 09:12.318
HOW ABOUT YOU

09:12.385 --> 09:14.053
COME TO THE MEETING WITH ME?

09:14.120 --> 09:15.187
&gt;&gt; OH, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

09:15.254 --> 09:15.655
WILL THERE BE

09:15.721 --> 09:17.523
A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE?

09:17.590 --> 09:18.291
&gt;&gt; COME ON, MOLLY,

09:18.357 --> 09:18.958
WE'VE GOT TO BREAK YOU

09:19.025 --> 09:20.526
OUT OF THAT SHELL OF YOURS.

09:20.593 --> 09:21.494
WE HAD TO BREAK MY UNCLE REGGIE

09:21.560 --> 09:22.261
OUT OF HIS SHELL ONCE.

09:22.328 --> 09:23.496
HE GOT A JOB OUTSIDE

09:23.562 --> 09:24.030
THE NUT HUT

09:24.096 --> 09:31.137
PLAYING A GIANT PISTACHIO.

09:31.203 --> 09:31.737
&gt;&gt; I DON'T SUPPOSE

09:31.804 --> 09:32.638
I COULD GET TIME OFF

09:32.705 --> 09:34.006
FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR.

09:34.073 --> 09:35.975
&gt;&gt; YOU GLUED MY FAVORITE MUG

09:36.042 --> 09:37.977
TO THE WALL.

09:38.044 --> 09:40.346
&gt;&gt; I DIDN'T, BUT WHATEVER.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.113
&gt;&gt; I'M HUNGRY.

09:41.180 --> 09:42.748
DO YOU HAVE A SANDWICH?

09:42.815 --> 09:43.549
&gt;&gt; NO.

09:43.616 --> 09:45.084
&gt;&gt; THEN I'LL HAVE TO GET MY OWN.

09:45.151 --> 09:46.986
DO YOU HAVE ANY MONEY?

09:47.053 --> 09:47.720
&gt;&gt; NO.

09:47.787 --> 09:51.724
&gt;&gt; AUGH.

09:51.791 --> 09:53.159
&gt;&gt; THERE HE IS,

09:53.225 --> 09:56.262
J.P. PIDDLEPOCKET.

09:56.329 --> 09:57.697

09:57.763 --> 09:58.464
&gt;&gt; UH-HUH

09:58.531 --> 10:00.967
I'M FROM DOWNTOWN NUNYA,

10:01.033 --> 10:03.970
AS IN NUNYA BUSINESS.

10:04.036 --> 10:04.904
&gt;&gt; JUST GET OUT OF HERE.

10:04.971 --> 10:06.605
I'M IN ENOUGH TROUBLE.

10:06.672 --> 10:08.140
&gt;&gt; FINE, SUIT YOURSELF,

10:08.207 --> 10:09.175
GUESS I'LL JUST HAVE TO

10:09.241 --> 10:10.176

10:13.980 --> 10:14.814
&gt;&gt; AND I'VE GOT A GREAT IDEA,

10:14.880 --> 10:15.348
I'M GONNA WRITE

10:15.414 --> 10:16.582
"RYAN WAS HERE."

10:16.649 --> 10:30.029
&gt;&gt; NATE, NATE, COME BACK HERE.

10:30.096 --> 10:30.863
&gt;&gt; BABS, ARE YOU BORED?

10:30.930 --> 10:33.566
&gt;&gt; SO BORED.

10:33.632 --> 10:34.200
WHAT DO YOU SAY,

10:34.266 --> 10:35.167
WE GO TO THE SALON

10:35.234 --> 10:37.870
AND GET OUR HAIR DID?

10:37.937 --> 10:38.537
&gt;&gt; I DON'T REALLY LIKE

10:38.604 --> 10:39.438
TO BE AWAY FROM MY PHONE,

10:39.505 --> 10:40.940
IN CASE MIKEY J CALLS.

10:41.007 --> 10:42.475
&gt;&gt; WHO'S MIKEY J?

10:42.541 --> 10:43.943
&gt;&gt; MY BOYFRIEND, REMEMBER?

10:44.010 --> 10:46.479
&gt;&gt; NO.

10:46.545 --> 10:47.680
&gt;&gt; WELL, HE IS.

10:47.747 --> 10:48.514
&gt;&gt; CAN'T HE JUST CALL YOU

10:48.581 --> 10:50.349
ON YOUR CELL PHONE?

10:50.416 --> 10:50.816
&gt;&gt; I GUESS SO.

10:50.883 --> 10:51.951
IT'S JUST THAT

10:52.018 --> 10:53.052
HE USUALLY CALLS HERE FIRST

10:53.119 --> 10:53.586
AND I HATE FOR HIM

10:53.652 --> 10:54.153
TO GO TO THE TROUBLE

10:54.220 --> 10:55.788
OF DIALING TWO NUMBERS.

10:55.855 --> 10:56.522
&gt;&gt; OH YEAH,

10:56.589 --> 10:58.724
YOU GOT A GOOD POINT.

10:58.791 --> 11:04.330
GET IN THE ELEVATOR.

11:04.397 --> 11:05.831
&gt;&gt; WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

11:05.898 --> 11:08.534
&gt;&gt; SO FAR, JUST THIS ONE WALL.

11:08.601 --> 11:10.936
&gt;&gt; GIVE ME THAT.

11:11.003 --> 11:12.538
&gt;&gt; PLEASE, MISTER, I BEG YOU

11:12.605 --> 11:14.140
NOT TO MAKE ME PARTICIPATE

11:14.206 --> 11:15.541
IN THIS MADNESS.

11:15.608 --> 11:16.275
&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

11:16.342 --> 11:18.444
I DIDN'T--

11:18.511 --> 11:19.311
RUCKMAN'S RIGHT BEHIND ME,

11:19.378 --> 11:28.387
ISN'T HE?

11:28.454 --> 11:29.188
&gt;&gt; NOW REMEMBER,

11:29.255 --> 11:30.756
THIS IS A GROWNUP MEETING,

11:30.823 --> 11:34.226
SO TRY AND BE PROFESSIONAL.

11:34.293 --> 11:36.762
&gt;&gt; F. DAVID PILLOWS!

11:36.829 --> 11:39.165
&gt;&gt; I'M TRUE JACKSON, HUGE FAN.

11:39.231 --> 11:42.201
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH.

11:42.268 --> 11:43.702
&gt;&gt; UNFORTUNATELY,

11:43.769 --> 11:44.737
MAX COULDN'T BE HERE TODAY.

11:44.804 --> 11:45.938
HE'S AT A VERY IMPORTANT

11:46.005 --> 11:47.239
FASHION EVENT.

11:47.306 --> 11:47.807
&gt;&gt; I THOUGHT IT WAS

11:47.873 --> 11:48.974
A TOFFEE FESTIVAL.

11:49.041 --> 11:52.845
&gt;&gt; ZIP IT, YES?

11:52.912 --> 11:54.413
&gt;&gt; HELLO.

11:54.480 --> 11:55.081
&gt;&gt; OH, THAT'S MOLLY.

11:55.147 --> 11:56.348
SHE'S MY LITTLE BUDDY.

11:56.415 --> 11:58.150
&gt;&gt; I LIKE YOUR SWEATER, MOLLY.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.519
IT MAKES YOU LOOK YOUTHFUL.

12:00.586 --> 12:02.788
&gt;&gt; I'M 13 1/2.

12:02.855 --> 12:04.623
&gt;&gt; BRAVO.

12:04.690 --> 12:05.925
&gt;&gt; SHALL WE GET STARTED?

12:05.991 --> 12:06.892
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.

12:06.959 --> 12:09.328
BUT BEFORE WE BEGIN, I WONDER IF

12:09.395 --> 12:15.534
THIS GENTLEMAN MIGHT STEP OUT?

12:15.601 --> 12:16.869
&gt;&gt; THAT'S BETTER.

12:16.936 --> 12:18.170
&gt;&gt; TRUE, I THROW THE FLOOR

12:18.237 --> 12:19.271
TO YOU.

12:19.338 --> 12:20.172
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

12:20.239 --> 12:21.207
MY DESIGN IS FOR THE GIRL

12:21.273 --> 12:22.274
WHO WORKS ALL DAY,

12:22.341 --> 12:23.642
BUT DOESN'T HAVE TIME TO CHANGE

12:23.709 --> 12:30.716
BEFORE GOING TO DINNER.

12:30.783 --> 12:32.985
&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU THINK, MOLLY?

12:33.052 --> 12:33.719
&gt;&gt; ME?

12:33.786 --> 12:34.753
&gt;&gt; YES, I LIKE TO HEAR

12:34.820 --> 12:36.689
EVERYBODY'S OPINION.

12:36.755 --> 12:38.190
&gt;&gt; OH, I DON'T KNOW.

12:38.257 --> 12:38.724
&gt;&gt; COME ON, MOLLY.

12:38.791 --> 12:40.593
WE'RE ALL FRIENDS HERE.

12:40.659 --> 12:42.695
TELL HIM WHAT YOU THINK.

12:42.761 --> 12:47.633
&gt;&gt; WELL, IT'S A LITTLE BORING.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.001
&gt;&gt; YOU SAID WHAT NOW?

12:49.068 --> 12:49.568
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW,

12:49.635 --> 12:51.804
KIND OF A SNOOZE-FEST.

12:51.871 --> 12:52.238
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU

12:52.304 --> 12:54.173
FOR YOUR OPINION, MOLLY.

12:54.240 --> 12:57.042
YOU CAN GO NOW.

12:57.109 --> 12:57.910
&gt;&gt; I HATE TO SAY IT,

12:57.977 --> 12:59.812
BUT SHE'S RIGHT.

12:59.879 --> 13:01.647
YOUR DRESS IS WELL CONSTRUCTED,

13:01.714 --> 13:02.948
BUT IT SEEMS A LITTLE

13:03.015 --> 13:06.051
LE FESTIVAL DE SOMMEIL.

13:06.118 --> 13:06.952
&gt;&gt; WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

13:07.019 --> 13:10.623
&gt;&gt; IT'S FRENCH FOR SNOOZE-FEST.

13:10.689 --> 13:11.157
&gt;&gt; I'M LOOKING

13:11.223 --> 13:13.526
FOR INSPIRATION, TRUE.

13:13.592 --> 13:16.195
WHERE'S YOUR INSPIRATION?

13:16.262 --> 13:17.897
&gt;&gt; THE OFF-BLACK STITCHING

13:17.963 --> 13:18.330
ON THE BACK

13:18.397 --> 13:21.267
IS A BOLD CHOICE, NO?

13:21.333 --> 13:24.770
&gt;&gt; I WAS HOPING TO BE SURPRISED.

13:24.837 --> 13:26.205
ANYWAY, I HAVE TO GO.

13:26.272 --> 13:26.906
THANK YOU VERY MUCH--

13:26.972 --> 13:29.408
&gt;&gt; CAN I PRESENT ANOTHER IDEA?

13:29.475 --> 13:30.543
&gt;&gt; I'M REALLY SORRY,

13:30.609 --> 13:31.644
BUT I HAVE TO BE AT THE AIRPORT

13:31.710 --> 13:33.145
IN TWO HOURS.

13:33.212 --> 13:36.282
&gt;&gt; THEN COME BACK IN ONE HOUR.

13:36.348 --> 13:38.384
&gt;&gt; OKAY, ONE HOUR.

13:38.450 --> 13:42.288
BUT I WANT TO BE SURPRISED.

13:42.354 --> 13:43.455
&gt;&gt; IF HE COMES BACK IN AN HOUR,

13:43.522 --> 13:54.800
I THINK WE'LL ALL BE SURPRISED.

13:54.867 --> 13:55.734
&gt;&gt; BORING, BORING?

13:55.801 --> 13:57.670
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

13:57.736 --> 13:58.571
&gt;&gt; HE ASKED ME MY OPINION.

13:58.637 --> 13:59.171
&gt;&gt; WELL, WHO TOLD YOU

13:59.238 --> 14:00.439
TO GIVE IT?

14:00.506 --> 14:01.974
&gt;&gt; YOU DID.

14:02.041 --> 14:02.775
BY THE WAY, I THINK

14:02.841 --> 14:03.509
YOU USED THE WORD ASPIRATIONAL

14:03.576 --> 14:05.010
WRONG IN THE MEETING.

14:05.077 --> 14:08.047
&gt;&gt; I'VE CREATED A MONSTER.

14:08.113 --> 14:09.381
FINE, F. DAVID PILLOWS

14:09.448 --> 14:10.382
WANTS INSPIRATION,

14:10.449 --> 14:12.685
I'M ALL ABOUT INSPIRATION.

14:12.751 --> 14:13.485
&gt;&gt; CAN I HELP?

14:13.552 --> 14:14.186
&gt;&gt; I THINK YOU'VE HELPED

14:14.253 --> 14:14.920
ENOUGH FOR ONE DAY.

14:14.987 --> 14:15.688
WHY DON'T YOU GO IN MY OFFICE

14:15.754 --> 14:18.924
AND PLAY FINANCIAL REPORTS?

14:18.991 --> 14:19.792
&gt;&gt; WELL, MOPPET,

14:19.858 --> 14:20.492
YOUR LITTLE BUDDY

14:20.559 --> 14:21.493
SURE MADE A MESS

14:21.560 --> 14:23.529
OUT OF YOUR PRESENTATION.

14:23.596 --> 14:25.631
I'M THINKING OF ADOPTING HER.

14:25.698 --> 14:26.365
&gt;&gt; I'VE GOT ONE HOUR

14:26.432 --> 14:28.033
TO COME UP WITH A GREAT IDEA.

14:28.100 --> 14:28.567
IT SHOULD BE EASY,

14:28.634 --> 14:29.268
IF MY LITTLE BUDDY

14:29.335 --> 14:30.703
STAYS OUT OF MY HAIR.

14:30.769 --> 14:31.403
&gt;&gt; WHY DON'T YOU TAKE HER

14:31.470 --> 14:32.938
TO THE FABRIC MARKET DOWNTOWN?

14:33.005 --> 14:33.906
THAT PLACE IS LIKE A MAZE.

14:33.973 --> 14:35.040
IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE

14:35.107 --> 14:36.775
NOT TO LOSE SOMEONE.

14:36.842 --> 14:37.376
&gt;&gt; WAIT, DIDN'T YOU

14:37.443 --> 14:37.910
TAKE ME THERE

14:37.977 --> 14:39.945
WHEN I FIRST STARTED?

14:40.012 --> 14:41.981
I WAS LOST FOR HOURS.

14:42.047 --> 14:44.250
&gt;&gt; I'M SURE I LOOKED FOR YOU.

14:44.316 --> 14:44.950
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW, AMANDA,

14:45.017 --> 14:45.651
IT SEEMS KIND OF MEAN

14:45.718 --> 14:46.885
TO DITCH HER SOMEWHERE.

14:46.952 --> 14:47.753
&gt;&gt; HEY, TRUE,

14:47.820 --> 14:48.954
I THINK THIS WOULD LOOK BETTER

14:49.021 --> 14:52.224
IF YOU KEPT THE BELT SIMPLE.

14:52.291 --> 14:53.425
&gt;&gt; GREAT IDEA.

14:53.492 --> 14:54.793
SAY, HOW'D YOU LIKE TO COME

14:54.860 --> 14:56.528
TO THE FABRIC MARKET WITH ME?

14:56.595 --> 14:57.896
&gt;&gt; SURE, I'LL GET MY BACKPACK.

14:57.963 --> 14:59.999

&gt;&gt; BABS AND I

15:12.444 --> 15:13.479
WENT TO THE BEAUTY SHOP.

15:21.153 --> 15:22.655
&gt;&gt; 3:30? I'M LATE.

15:32.431 --> 15:33.098
&gt;&gt; MIKEY J'S, HE TOLD ME

IF YOU DIDN'T?

15:37.636 --> 15:38.570
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW.

15:44.276 --> 15:46.145

15:46.211 --> 15:47.313
&gt;&gt; I'VE HAD

15:47.379 --> 15:49.715
A FEW OF THOSE IN MY DAY.

15:49.782 --> 15:50.983
MY FIRST BOYFRIEND

15:51.050 --> 15:52.217
WAS A MUSICIAN.

15:52.284 --> 15:53.285
&gt;&gt; COOL.

15:53.352 --> 15:54.687
&gt;&gt; YEAH, HE HAD A BAND,

15:54.753 --> 15:56.188
CROUCH POTATO.

15:56.255 --> 15:57.556
IT STARTED OUT AS A TYPO

15:57.623 --> 15:58.557
AT FIRST, BUT AT THAT POINT,

15:58.624 --> 15:59.258
THEY PRINTED OUT

15:59.325 --> 16:02.895
TOO MANY T-SHIRTS TO CHANGE IT.

16:02.961 --> 16:03.796
I FOLLOWED HIM EVERYWHERE,

16:03.862 --> 16:04.330
I DROPPED

16:04.396 --> 16:07.066
OUT OF SCHOOL, EVERYTHING.

16:07.132 --> 16:08.334
&gt;&gt; DID YOU MARRY HIM?

16:08.400 --> 16:10.903
&gt;&gt; NO, WE BROKE UP EVENTUALLY.

16:10.969 --> 16:12.104
THEN I FOLLOWED ANOTHER BOY.

16:12.171 --> 16:13.339
AND ANOTHER ONE AFTER THAT.

16:13.405 --> 16:14.206
AND NOW, HERE I AM,

19:31.537 --> 19:32.070
&gt;&gt; MAYBE, BY THINKING

19:32.137 --> 19:32.938
OF THE WORST IDEA,

19:33.005 --> 19:34.506
YOU'LL GET THE BEST IDEA.

INSTEAD OF PICTURING

19:35.240 --> 19:35.908
A BEAUTIFUL DRESS

19:35.974 --> 19:37.142
ON A BEAUTIFUL MODEL,

19:37.209 --> 19:41.980
DO THE OPPOSITE.

&gt;&gt; ANYTHING?

19:42.848 --> 19:44.616
&gt;&gt; NOPE, I'M ALL OUT OF IDEAS

19:53.492 --> 20:01.333

20:08.407 --> 20:10.342
IT'S CLASSIC AND REFINED,

BUT THE PAINT SPLATTER

20:11.043 --> 20:13.845
IS VERY FASHION FORWARD.

20:13.912 --> 20:16.214
WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS FABRIC?

20:16.281 --> 20:16.848
&gt;&gt; IT WAS JUST SOMETHING

&gt;&gt; NICE WORK, MOLLY.

20:35.968 --> 20:37.669
IT WAS GREAT MEETING EVERYONE.

20:37.736 --> 20:39.605

20:39.671 --> 20:44.543

20:44.610 --> 20:49.181
I'LL JUST TAKE A CAB.

20:49.247 --> 20:49.948
&gt;&gt; THE NAME OF THE GAME

20:50.015 --> 20:51.183
IS FOLLOW THE QUEEN.

20:51.249 --> 20:51.917
KEEP AN EYE ON HER.

20:51.984 --> 20:52.985
OH, WHERE ARE YOU GOING,

20:53.051 --> 20:55.220
PRETTY LADY?

20:55.287 --> 20:56.321
&gt;&gt; WELL, I WASN'T

21:13.605 --> 21:14.072
FAMILY STYLE MEANS

21:14.139 --> 21:15.007
TRYING TO KEEP THE SALT

21:15.073 --> 21:16.041
AWAY FROM MY DAD.

21:21.713 --> 21:23.015

21:30.889 --> 21:31.390

21:31.456 --> 21:32.658

21:32.724 --> 21:33.759
I HOPE EVERYONE'S HUNGRY.

21:33.825 --> 21:35.460
&gt;&gt; HECKS YEAH, I'M STARVING.

21:35.527 --> 21:36.194
&gt;&gt; OH, AND IF YOU HIT

21:36.261 --> 21:36.962

21:37.029 --> 21:38.196
I THINK HANK'S TIN-CUP NOSE

21:38.263 --> 21:40.999
FELL INTO THE GRILL.

21:41.066 --> 21:41.600
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WEIRD,

21:41.667 --> 21:43.435
I'M NOT STARVING ANYMORE.

21:44.102 --> 21:44.703
A LOT OF FUN

21:44.770 --> 21:45.537

21:45.604 --> 21:46.138
WE HAVEN'T SEEN HIM

21:46.204 --> 21:48.774
SINCE THIS MORNING.

21:48.840 --> 21:49.341
&gt;&gt; AHH,

21:49.408 --> 21:50.876

21:57.082 --> 21:57.716

21:57.783 --> 21:58.483
I MIGHT AS WELL DO SOMETHING

21:58.550 --> 21:59.251
TO EARN IT.

21:59.317 --> 22:00.152
&gt;&gt; ALRIGHT.

22:00.218 --> 22:00.886
WELL FOR STARTERS,

22:00.952 --> 22:01.420

22:02.721 --> 22:03.889
STEAL ALL THE FROG PARTS,

22:03.955 --> 22:04.389
AND PUT THEM IN

22:04.456 --> 22:06.124
TOMORROW'S MEATLOAF.

22:06.191 --> 22:06.725
&gt;&gt; KEEP TALKING.

22:06.792 --> 22:07.192
&gt;&gt; THEN WE GET

22:13.432 --> 22:15.667
&gt;&gt; WHY YOU ACTING SO PECULIAR?

22:15.734 --> 22:17.869

22:19.204 --> 22:20.238

22:21.940 --> 22:24.743
&gt;&gt; BUNNY RABBIT,
