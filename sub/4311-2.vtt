00:15.338 --> 00:17.405
Morning.

00:17.472 --> 00:18.505
Jesus.

00:19.157 --> 00:20.638
No... Daniel.

00:21.985 --> 00:23.178
I forgot you were here.

00:23.572 --> 00:26.437
I don't know how that's
possible, but I... did.

00:27.276 --> 00:28.604
I don't know why I drink.

00:28.672 --> 00:31.305
Don't like the high, and
I hate the hangover.

00:31.879 --> 00:32.952
What are you looking for?

00:33.210 --> 00:35.005
Time. You have the time?

00:35.476 --> 00:36.772
You have a watch.

00:36.838 --> 00:38.238
It's broken.

00:38.305 --> 00:39.605
I don't have the time.

00:39.672 --> 00:41.272
I have a phone that has the time.

00:42.117 --> 00:43.072
A phone?

00:43.138 --> 00:44.578
Yes.

00:45.598 --> 00:47.911
I saw a phone in the kitchen.

00:48.472 --> 00:50.138
In the drawer.

00:52.538 --> 00:55.672
The one with the, uh, i-ice-cream scooper.

01:00.799 --> 01:03.005
Okay, I'm definitely late.

01:03.901 --> 01:05.604
There's cereal.

01:05.672 --> 01:07.505
I don't think there's any milk.

01:07.572 --> 01:08.591
No problem.

01:08.779 --> 01:12.538
Sorry, the fridge isn't
perpetually stocked like mom's.

01:12.605 --> 01:15.038
See, the way I roll is...

01:15.105 --> 01:18.733
I don't eat. I don't eat. I don't eat.

01:20.038 --> 01:21.622
And then I eat shit.

01:22.045 --> 01:24.338
A lot of shit.

01:24.405 --> 01:26.405
Seems to be working.

01:30.705 --> 01:31.672
How's your bed?

01:33.872 --> 01:35.037
Airy.

01:35.805 --> 01:37.372
Oh, you need a key.

01:37.438 --> 01:39.172
I-i don't have to have a key.

01:39.238 --> 01:42.072
Yes, you do. People steal shit around here.

01:42.958 --> 01:44.872
That was the one problem I didn't have

01:44.938 --> 01:45.972
where I used to live.

01:46.038 --> 01:47.213
Mom's?

01:47.572 --> 01:49.005
The place before.

01:57.938 --> 01:59.572
You need some money?

02:00.643 --> 02:03.709
No, I just needed a place
to stay, Amantha...

02:04.105 --> 02:05.372
Temporarily.

02:05.438 --> 02:06.638
That's all.

02:09.172 --> 02:10.538
Well, have a great day.

02:12.332 --> 02:14.105
Yes, you too.

02:20.305 --> 02:21.897
Did Teddy say where Tawney was?

02:23.131 --> 02:24.605
He said he didn't know.

02:24.672 --> 02:26.038
Huh.

02:28.935 --> 02:30.902
I think it had something to do with Daniel.

02:32.302 --> 02:34.002
Is that right?

02:38.035 --> 02:39.402
Oh, and Amantha called.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.768
Said Daniel's staying with her now.

02:42.245 --> 02:43.410
Well, that's good to hear.

02:43.639 --> 02:44.755
Well, that is good to hear.

02:45.585 --> 02:47.768
But I wonder why Daniel just
up and went to Amantha's

02:47.835 --> 02:49.035
all of a sudden.

02:49.102 --> 02:50.868
That's curious, don't you think?

02:52.064 --> 02:53.434
I'm sure he had his reasons.

02:53.502 --> 02:55.758
And I wonder why you're lying to me, Ted.

02:57.768 --> 02:59.602
I'm not lying to you, Janet.

02:59.668 --> 03:02.357
Okay, maybe not, but you're
sure not telling me something.

03:04.142 --> 03:05.468
I asked him to leave.

03:06.316 --> 03:07.502
Why?

03:07.568 --> 03:09.321
Why would you do that?

03:10.468 --> 03:12.335
And I asked him to tell you the reason.

03:12.402 --> 03:13.502
Well, he didn't.

03:13.568 --> 03:15.168
What was the reason, Ted?

03:16.512 --> 03:18.268
Daniel assaulted Teddy.

03:19.735 --> 03:20.668
What?

03:21.173 --> 03:22.009
He choked him out.

03:22.111 --> 03:23.224
Choked him out?

03:23.324 --> 03:24.922
You mean he strangled him?

03:25.022 --> 03:26.168
No, that's different.

03:26.235 --> 03:27.968
Uh, evidently, when you choke somebody out,

03:28.035 --> 03:30.282
you cut off their blood
supply, and they pass out.

03:30.368 --> 03:31.212
Pass out?

03:31.251 --> 03:33.168
That's the way you gain
control or whatever.

03:33.235 --> 03:34.402
"Gain control"?

03:34.468 --> 03:36.573
How do you know all this, Ted?

03:38.235 --> 03:39.768
The senator told me.

03:41.116 --> 03:42.468
Anyway, Teddy told the Sheriff,

03:42.535 --> 03:45.268
and he, the Sheriff,
told the senator, and...

03:45.999 --> 03:47.087
And so on.

03:50.377 --> 03:52.768
I didn't want to have to
tell you this, Janet.

03:55.361 --> 03:56.881
I'm gonna make some coffee.

03:57.979 --> 03:59.243
Come down when you're dressed.

04:34.071 --> 04:36.071
<font color="#ff0000">Sync and corrections by btsix

05:11.502 --> 05:14.535
They call it "aging
out" when you turn 18.

05:14.955 --> 05:16.852
What happens when you age out?

05:17.578 --> 05:21.129
Uh, well, legally, you
can leave the system,

05:21.187 --> 05:22.620
but, um...

05:23.236 --> 05:26.086
You can also stay if you get
a job or go to school...

05:26.153 --> 05:28.151
If you and your foster parent agree...

05:28.284 --> 05:31.137
Until you're 21, if you want.

05:31.219 --> 05:32.786
And what did you do?

05:33.017 --> 05:35.083
I stayed until I was 20.

05:36.475 --> 05:39.417
Miss Kathy liked help with
the younger kids and...

05:40.053 --> 05:41.417
And I liked doing it.

05:41.483 --> 05:43.202
And I liked miss Kathy, too.

05:43.577 --> 05:45.050
She was, um...

05:45.819 --> 05:46.983
You know, fair.

05:47.224 --> 05:49.024
Firm but fair.

05:51.647 --> 05:53.380
I always felt safe with her.

05:53.472 --> 05:55.738
Do you feel safe with Ted?

05:55.805 --> 05:56.938
Teddy.

05:57.005 --> 05:58.605
That's what we call him... "Teddy."

05:58.672 --> 06:00.837
His dad's Ted.

06:00.838 --> 06:03.638
I don't know if he likes
being called "Teddy."

06:03.705 --> 06:05.172
But...

06:05.238 --> 06:07.272
It helps people keep them apart.

06:07.337 --> 06:08.971
Did you ever ask him?

06:09.037 --> 06:10.071
What?

06:10.137 --> 06:11.971
If he liked being called "Teddy."

06:13.337 --> 06:14.571
Um...

06:14.638 --> 06:17.919
No, i-i never... Never thought to.

06:19.704 --> 06:22.571
Tawney, you can say
whatever you want to here.

06:22.637 --> 06:23.871
Do you know that?

06:33.072 --> 06:34.693
He's so mad... Teddy.

06:36.105 --> 06:38.672
When he gets mad, how
does that make you feel?

06:41.072 --> 06:43.260
It's usually about
something that I've done,

06:44.105 --> 06:46.505
so I would try to figure
out what it was first.

06:46.572 --> 06:48.972
That's what you were thinking.

06:49.038 --> 06:50.838
But how were you feeling?

06:53.537 --> 06:56.463
Wow. That's funny, um...

06:57.981 --> 06:59.038
Well...

06:59.105 --> 07:01.538
I feel concerned.

07:03.372 --> 07:05.738
Uh, t-that's not a feeling either, is it?

07:06.263 --> 07:07.572
Concerned about what?

07:09.871 --> 07:12.412
Uh, about what was gonna happen next.

07:13.482 --> 07:15.177
Teddy would n-never hit me.

07:15.522 --> 07:16.991
He never has.

07:17.057 --> 07:18.027
But...

07:20.924 --> 07:23.291
He can bear down on you sometimes.

07:23.803 --> 07:25.124
"Bear down"?

07:28.224 --> 07:29.891
Corner you.

07:29.941 --> 07:32.000
Like you're trapped.

07:33.144 --> 07:34.649
Like there's no way out.

07:35.031 --> 07:37.698
And what do you want to do
when you feel that way?

07:45.464 --> 07:47.398
Run.

07:48.798 --> 07:50.277
Run like the devil.

07:52.280 --> 07:55.663
That's a very reasonable impulse, Tawney.

07:55.743 --> 07:57.035
But I never did.

07:58.276 --> 07:59.443
Uh...

07:59.510 --> 08:00.976
Not until that night.

08:04.310 --> 08:06.943
Tawney, do you want to save your marriage?

08:11.310 --> 08:13.076
You're gonna have to trust someone...

08:14.605 --> 08:16.003
At some point.

08:18.810 --> 08:20.643
I feel so guilty.

08:21.298 --> 08:22.640
About what?

08:28.110 --> 08:30.383
When I had my miscarriage...

08:33.743 --> 08:35.533
Part of me was relieved.

08:37.576 --> 08:40.610
You're not the first woman
to have had that experience.

08:41.759 --> 08:44.411
And you won't be the last.

08:44.476 --> 08:47.543
And from what little I
know about you already,

08:47.610 --> 08:50.610
it's not that surprising, you know?

08:53.343 --> 08:54.610
I suppose.

08:57.910 --> 08:59.911
No gun found, no note,

09:00.101 --> 09:02.086
nothing in the vicinity of the river

09:02.186 --> 09:03.410
that indicates suicide.

09:03.476 --> 09:07.410
Well, maybe something will
turn up helpful in Florida.

09:07.476 --> 09:10.343
I'm not willing to jump to
conclusions of foul play yet.

09:10.997 --> 09:13.416
I already went to Florida, Ms. Person.

09:15.810 --> 09:17.110
When?

09:17.757 --> 09:20.966
Couple of days ago to George's trailer.

09:22.843 --> 09:24.443
Before all this happened

09:24.510 --> 09:26.775
or before we knew all this happened.

09:26.776 --> 09:29.410
Please don't tell me you went
inside Mr. Melton's trailer.

09:29.476 --> 09:31.310
It was unlocked.

09:31.852 --> 09:33.419
Seriously, Sheriff?

09:33.976 --> 09:36.410
You shouldn't have gone
inside without a warrant.

09:36.476 --> 09:38.410
I realize that now.

09:38.476 --> 09:39.743
Not even your jurisdiction.

09:39.810 --> 09:41.843
You're state.

09:44.317 --> 09:45.950
Ma'am, I've been thinking,

09:46.743 --> 09:48.310
we could bring in the GBI on this end,

09:48.376 --> 09:50.910
let them oversee things here in Paulie

09:50.976 --> 09:52.576
if it'd make you feel better.

09:52.643 --> 09:54.576
- And what would that be saying?
- It would be saying

09:54.643 --> 09:55.976
that we're doing everything on the level.

09:56.043 --> 09:57.276
It would be saying

09:57.343 --> 09:59.443
that things are already tainted here.

09:59.510 --> 10:01.576
Are things tainted here, Sheriff?

10:01.643 --> 10:02.843
Not by me.

10:02.910 --> 10:05.676
And/or that there's no faith
that the investigation

10:05.743 --> 10:08.243
can be handled by you, the Sheriff,

10:08.310 --> 10:10.476
or me, the District Attorney.

10:10.543 --> 10:12.110
Is that what you want?

10:12.176 --> 10:13.443
Of course not.

10:13.510 --> 10:16.643
That's why I'm telling you this now.

10:16.710 --> 10:18.443
I sure don't want to step aside,

10:18.510 --> 10:21.010
but I'm willing to if you
feel that's what's best.

10:32.076 --> 10:33.523
I'm so sorry.

10:33.770 --> 10:35.255
Forgot to set my alarm.

10:35.456 --> 10:37.148
Happens to the best of us.

10:37.876 --> 10:41.811
Amantha, this is our
returning mother, Peanut.

10:42.030 --> 10:44.310
Thanks for keeping my place warm.

10:46.110 --> 10:47.843
You're kind of a legend around here.

10:47.846 --> 10:49.379
Well...

10:51.443 --> 10:53.541
So, that's Wyatt Andrew.

10:55.376 --> 10:56.976
God, that must've hurt.

10:57.043 --> 10:59.310
Not really. I had an epidermis.

11:01.491 --> 11:02.817
Amantha.

11:02.877 --> 11:04.760
That's such an unusual name.

11:04.763 --> 11:05.810
Family name?

11:07.143 --> 11:08.243
No.

11:08.709 --> 11:10.809
Actually, my mother's dyslexic.

11:12.276 --> 11:13.710
Kidding.

11:14.348 --> 11:16.244
It is a family name, Peanut.

11:16.310 --> 11:19.676
My great-aunt was Amantha...
Amantha Kathryn.

11:19.743 --> 11:21.676
Bet you get called "Amanda" a lot.

11:21.743 --> 11:24.050
Mm, not so much anymore.

11:24.255 --> 11:26.284
What about you... Family name?

11:26.467 --> 11:27.804
Oh, no.

11:27.807 --> 11:29.543
Daddy just started calling me that.

11:29.610 --> 11:31.411
I mean, he liked boiled peanuts and all,

11:31.414 --> 11:33.443
but we don't really think that
was the reason.

11:34.910 --> 11:36.176
Hi, Terry.

11:36.243 --> 11:37.776
Hey, Amantha.

11:37.843 --> 11:39.610
Amantha?

11:44.643 --> 11:46.943
Thought I'd just give
Peanut her register back.

11:47.010 --> 11:48.043
Been here nine years.

11:48.110 --> 11:49.610
Nine years?

11:49.676 --> 11:50.943
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

11:51.010 --> 11:53.010
Did she start when she was 5?

11:53.076 --> 11:54.467
Terry's leaving early.

11:54.568 --> 11:56.776
Till then, you can stock.

11:56.843 --> 11:58.243
Great.

11:58.310 --> 12:01.076
Um, you thought anymore
about our conversation?

12:01.779 --> 12:03.159
I have.

12:03.343 --> 12:05.143
Good.

12:05.210 --> 12:07.110
Let's talk about it later.

12:07.176 --> 12:08.910
- Okay.
- Okay.

12:20.897 --> 12:23.279
What did you come across when
you went inside, Sheriff?

12:23.830 --> 12:26.863
Because whatever you found can't
be used if you handled it

12:26.930 --> 12:28.630
or if it can't be reasonably argued

12:28.697 --> 12:31.330
that it would've discovered
in an official investigation.

12:31.786 --> 12:34.319
I don't think that's gonna be a problem.

12:34.386 --> 12:36.019
Okay.

12:36.086 --> 12:38.452
George's wallet was there for one.

12:38.519 --> 12:40.019
How do you know it was his?

12:40.086 --> 12:41.852
I saw his driver's license.

12:41.919 --> 12:42.952
What else?

12:43.019 --> 12:45.152
His cellphone.

12:45.219 --> 12:47.241
I thought you said George's
cellphone was used

12:47.341 --> 12:48.717
six weeks ago in Paulie.

12:48.804 --> 12:49.837
Yes.

12:49.904 --> 12:51.437
So, if that's his phone,

12:51.504 --> 12:54.670
it somehow got back to his
trailer after he died.

12:55.606 --> 12:57.837
Uh, let's don't get ahead of ourselves.

12:57.840 --> 12:59.926
I mean, we don't know
the exact time of death

13:00.004 --> 13:02.470
or if that is, indeed, his phone.

13:05.637 --> 13:07.070
There's something else.

13:07.944 --> 13:09.870
Daniel Holden and Trey
Willis had been there

13:09.937 --> 13:11.604
a couple of days before me.

13:14.005 --> 13:15.704
How do you even know this?

13:15.770 --> 13:18.204
Security cameras on the property,

13:18.270 --> 13:21.704
and Holden left a note in
the trailer for George.

13:21.770 --> 13:22.804
A note?

13:22.870 --> 13:24.470
Saying he'd stopped by

13:24.537 --> 13:27.104
and then apologizing for
bashing George's wall in.

13:28.870 --> 13:30.104
Good Lord.

13:33.437 --> 13:34.770
Any more bombs?

13:36.237 --> 13:37.437
No.

13:37.504 --> 13:38.837
Very well.

13:39.621 --> 13:41.604
I'll call the district attorney in Live Oak

13:41.670 --> 13:43.504
and explain what happened.

13:43.570 --> 13:46.337
You should send someone other than yourself

13:46.404 --> 13:49.504
from the Sheriff's department
down to monitor the scene,

13:49.570 --> 13:52.904
and under no circumstances are
they to enter that trailer.

13:52.970 --> 13:54.337
Yes, ma'am.

13:54.404 --> 13:56.237
And don't you go on
anymore expeditions again

13:56.304 --> 13:58.237
without conferring with me first.

13:58.304 --> 13:59.337
Of course.

14:05.237 --> 14:07.342
Let me know when you notify next of kin.

14:07.756 --> 14:09.068
Yes, ma'am.

14:35.070 --> 14:36.970
What should I do?

14:38.704 --> 14:41.470
What should I do? What should I do?

14:41.537 --> 14:43.137
What should I do?

14:43.204 --> 14:44.914
What should I do?

14:45.322 --> 14:46.541
What should I do?

14:47.204 --> 14:48.304
What should I do?

14:48.370 --> 14:51.398
What should I do? What should I do?

14:51.680 --> 14:53.137
What should I do?

14:57.737 --> 14:59.037
What should I do?

14:59.104 --> 15:00.470
What should I do?

15:00.537 --> 15:01.837
What should I do?

15:01.904 --> 15:03.937
What should I do?

15:05.137 --> 15:06.885
What the hell should I do?

15:21.937 --> 15:23.704
Chop wood.

15:25.404 --> 15:27.370
And carry water.

15:29.104 --> 15:32.437
Elementary, dear Kerwin.

15:38.877 --> 15:40.844
This guy gets out on a DNA thing,

15:40.911 --> 15:43.011
then he re-confesses, and his punishment is

15:43.077 --> 15:45.344
he's banished from Paulie, Georgia?

15:45.411 --> 15:47.477
Welcome to America, friend.

15:47.544 --> 15:50.111
That's not a punishment. That's a reward.

15:50.177 --> 15:52.477
Easy now. We have friends down there.

15:54.511 --> 15:56.011
I don't know why...

15:58.844 --> 16:00.444
Sounds like a back-room deal,

16:00.511 --> 16:03.277
which usually means both
sides had something to hide.

16:09.344 --> 16:10.555
It's all right.

16:12.146 --> 16:14.218
I forget to turn it on sometimes, too.

16:15.530 --> 16:16.996
Is that right?

16:17.777 --> 16:19.344
Beety dickson said he saw
that thing a-flapping

16:19.411 --> 16:20.638
the other day.

16:20.845 --> 16:23.250
Said it reminded him to get
some new tires for his wife.

16:23.844 --> 16:25.277
That's great, dad.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.520
Somebody return those rims outside?

16:29.777 --> 16:31.586
A guy got behind on his payments.

16:32.248 --> 16:33.553
That's the first one, isn't it?

16:34.989 --> 16:36.148
So far.

16:36.653 --> 16:38.302
Not bad when you think about it.

16:41.894 --> 16:43.520
When's the last time you talked to mama?

16:45.053 --> 16:46.120
Margaret?

16:47.586 --> 16:48.820
Yeah, dad.

16:48.886 --> 16:51.386
My mother, your ex-wife.

16:54.586 --> 16:56.166
About five years ago.

16:56.920 --> 16:59.313
She wanted to borrow some money.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.494
Why?

17:04.619 --> 17:05.751
I don't know.

17:07.319 --> 17:09.337
Just been thinking about her, I guess.

17:11.845 --> 17:13.345
That's good.

17:31.120 --> 17:32.586
I'm gonna go run some errands
if that's all right.

17:32.653 --> 17:33.642
Sure.

17:34.620 --> 17:37.126
Janet says Daniel's moved in with Amantha.

17:40.853 --> 17:43.186
Just... thought you might want to know.

17:47.986 --> 17:49.120
Okay, dad.

17:49.820 --> 17:51.753
Now I know.

18:21.386 --> 18:22.675
Hello, Jon.

18:22.775 --> 18:23.953
Janet.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.486
What brings you by?

18:25.553 --> 18:26.653
Is Daniel in?

18:26.994 --> 18:28.153
He's not answering his phone.

18:29.886 --> 18:32.194
Actually, he's staying with Amantha now.

18:33.253 --> 18:34.504
"Staying"?

18:35.284 --> 18:36.453
Like, living with her?

18:37.054 --> 18:38.710
Yes, they're, um...

18:39.662 --> 18:40.822
Housemates.

18:42.553 --> 18:44.820
Well, uh, please come in.

19:03.086 --> 19:04.731
Don't jump in.

19:06.720 --> 19:08.286
It's, uh...

19:08.353 --> 19:11.420
It's empty. I'm gonna repaint it.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.456
Makes sense, doesn't it?

19:16.386 --> 19:17.985
To empty it before you paint it.

19:19.486 --> 19:20.653
Yeah, you...

19:20.720 --> 19:22.753
You don't want to forget that step.

19:23.820 --> 19:25.420
No.

19:27.786 --> 19:29.686
Do you know who I am?

19:29.753 --> 19:32.686
The manager, i would suspect.

19:35.086 --> 19:36.020
Melvin.

19:36.086 --> 19:37.653
Melvin.

19:40.220 --> 19:41.740
Oh, Melvin.

19:43.114 --> 19:44.686
Hello, Melvin, I-I'm sorry.

19:44.753 --> 19:46.353
It's been a long time.

19:46.799 --> 19:48.053
Yeah.

19:48.120 --> 19:51.096
Well, good to see you, Daniel.

19:51.196 --> 19:52.553
Out and about.

19:52.620 --> 19:53.786
Yes.

19:53.853 --> 19:55.786
How are your turtles?

19:55.853 --> 19:57.520
Well, they're dead.

19:58.164 --> 20:01.386
I mean, they lived a
good life, uh, except...

20:01.852 --> 20:03.054
One.

20:03.120 --> 20:05.053
To the good life.

20:05.120 --> 20:07.871
And the turtles in all their flavors.

20:08.786 --> 20:09.953
Mm.

20:12.153 --> 20:14.220
Let me show you the laundry room.

20:14.286 --> 20:15.720
I'd appreciate that.

20:16.986 --> 20:18.953
I was rather spoiled as a child.

20:19.020 --> 20:20.086
How's that?

20:20.153 --> 20:23.786
I never actually did laundry.

20:25.553 --> 20:27.086
Oh... Yeah.

20:27.153 --> 20:28.220
Well...

20:28.286 --> 20:29.720
I can show the basics.

20:29.786 --> 20:33.637
It's overrated, really... The mechanics.

20:35.729 --> 20:37.598
The process I find soothing.

20:38.286 --> 20:40.486
Oh, do you have quarters, Melvin?

20:40.553 --> 20:43.786
I always keep a roll on
me for just this reason.

20:43.853 --> 20:46.986
People don't keep a lot
of change these days...

20:47.053 --> 20:48.872
Loose change on their person.

20:49.286 --> 20:51.622
Money's becoming more and more virtual.

20:53.420 --> 20:54.683
Illuminating.

20:55.053 --> 20:57.153
I have a ten.

20:57.220 --> 20:58.686
Perfect.

20:58.753 --> 21:01.236
Well, he just wanted a change, I guess.

21:02.186 --> 21:04.653
Did he discuss it with you?

21:04.720 --> 21:05.786
Um...

21:06.583 --> 21:07.916
Not in detail, no.

21:08.740 --> 21:10.920
Well, that's one of the things
I want to speak with him about.

21:12.053 --> 21:14.253
Daniel is gonna have to be
more accountable to others

21:14.320 --> 21:15.686
of his whereabouts.

21:15.753 --> 21:17.311
As in officially.

21:18.053 --> 21:20.120
The terms of his probation
are somewhat stringent.

21:20.752 --> 21:22.920
I don't even know what
the decision was, Jon.

21:23.020 --> 21:24.553
How long is his probation?

21:25.026 --> 21:26.159
20 years.

21:27.686 --> 21:29.486
Oh, my God.

21:31.353 --> 21:33.120
I...

21:33.186 --> 21:36.233
I tried to mitigate the
terms as much as possible.

21:37.550 --> 21:40.686
But he did, after all,
plead to a serious offense.

21:42.220 --> 21:43.553
I'm sorry.

21:44.920 --> 21:46.553
I know you did your best.

21:50.053 --> 21:55.453
Are you gonna be around, Jon,
um, until he... until he goes?

21:56.441 --> 21:58.293
Actually, I'm leaving in a couple of days.

22:00.339 --> 22:01.753
I have other cases.

22:02.964 --> 22:04.273
Of course.

22:05.025 --> 22:07.231
And Amantha and I are...

22:08.314 --> 22:10.386
Taking a step back for a bit, too.

22:12.820 --> 22:14.472
On the personal front.

22:16.120 --> 22:17.586
Don't know if she mentioned it.

22:17.653 --> 22:18.886
Not a word.

22:20.920 --> 22:22.153
A Holden trait.

22:24.163 --> 22:26.100
But I'll be a phone call away, Janet.

22:27.086 --> 22:28.353
Anytime day or night.

22:28.420 --> 22:29.920
And...

22:30.020 --> 22:31.901
I can get on a plane.

22:34.620 --> 22:36.286
That's very kind of you, Jon.

22:42.160 --> 22:44.253
I am not abandoning your son.

22:44.320 --> 22:45.420
Well, me neither.

22:46.853 --> 22:49.952
So, uh, what can I do to help our Daniel?

22:51.732 --> 22:52.464
Well...

22:54.112 --> 22:56.243
He needs to decide on a place to live.

22:57.282 --> 22:59.720
A city and state would be
a positive step forward.

22:59.786 --> 23:00.986
- Right.
- The sooner, the better.

23:07.286 --> 23:10.394
The new Canaan Project is a non-profit

23:10.494 --> 23:13.820
that helps ex-offenders
re-acclimate in society.

23:15.189 --> 23:17.148
It sounds institutional.

23:17.249 --> 23:19.453
It's certainly structured, but...

23:19.520 --> 23:21.753
It offers job counseling...

23:22.343 --> 23:23.904
Psychological counseling.

23:25.492 --> 23:26.620
I think we lose sight

23:26.686 --> 23:28.653
of just how damaged he is sometimes.

23:29.310 --> 23:30.779
Not me.

23:31.786 --> 23:33.620
I see it all the time.

23:35.429 --> 23:37.086
I thought being here would help.

23:37.535 --> 23:39.124
I'm sure it did.

23:39.886 --> 23:41.453
Mm, now we just need to make sure

23:41.520 --> 23:43.506
he gets the best chance possible to...

23:44.386 --> 23:45.553
Thrive.

23:47.653 --> 23:48.831
Well...

23:50.104 --> 23:51.504
Let's get busy then.

24:33.297 --> 24:34.687
Hey, Teddy.

24:36.497 --> 24:38.256
Hey, Mitch!

24:40.195 --> 24:41.411
What are you up to?

24:41.511 --> 24:43.397
Oh, I just wanted to see if I could come by

24:43.463 --> 24:45.130
and talk to Tawney for a minute.

24:45.197 --> 24:46.863
Well, she's not here right now.

24:49.830 --> 24:51.163
You know where she's at?

24:51.230 --> 24:53.351
Oh, she's off with Beth and maty.

24:53.863 --> 24:54.997
That's nice.

24:57.747 --> 24:58.970
Well, I just...

24:59.070 --> 25:00.763
Brought some of her things.

25:00.830 --> 25:01.930
Is that right?

25:02.423 --> 25:03.563
Knocked on your door.

25:04.243 --> 25:05.763
I was in the bathroom, Ted.

25:07.052 --> 25:08.339
Well, anyway, I'll...

25:09.144 --> 25:10.663
Throw this stuff in her car.

25:11.046 --> 25:12.363
I can give them to her.

25:16.063 --> 25:18.806
She's got, you know,
personal things in here,

25:18.906 --> 25:20.395
you know, girlie stuff, so...

25:22.121 --> 25:24.384
I'm not gonna bother with
her personals, Teddy.

25:31.063 --> 25:33.112
Yeah. Okay.

25:34.804 --> 25:36.237
Just tell her I, um...

25:41.930 --> 25:43.763
You don't have to
tell her anything. It's...

25:43.830 --> 25:45.397
Self-explanatory.

25:46.725 --> 25:48.163
Okay.

25:48.230 --> 25:49.807
Have a good day.

25:52.430 --> 25:53.877
You got a problem with me, Mitch?

25:56.763 --> 25:58.147
Not at all, Teddy.

25:58.763 --> 26:00.563
Just trying to be a good neighbor.

26:03.697 --> 26:06.277
I guess we got different
ideas on what that means.

26:14.597 --> 26:17.197
Ain't you got somebody else
that can do this for you?

26:19.239 --> 26:20.374
Not yet.

26:21.730 --> 26:24.163
Guess that's why you get
paid the big bucks.

26:25.394 --> 26:26.268
Guess so.

26:30.897 --> 26:32.146
So, now what?

26:32.907 --> 26:34.149
What do you mean?

26:34.722 --> 26:37.058
You moving on to the whodunit phase?

26:37.499 --> 26:38.663
We're a long way from saying

26:38.730 --> 26:41.263
this happened to George by another's hand.

26:42.235 --> 26:44.597
Well, let me know when you get there.

26:45.763 --> 26:47.730
You don't believe there's any way your son

26:47.797 --> 26:49.525
could've done this to himself?

26:52.797 --> 26:54.924
Could George have taken his own life?

26:57.397 --> 26:58.279
Maybe.

26:59.008 --> 27:01.730
But he would've taken a bunch
of them damn pills he was on

27:01.797 --> 27:03.500
o-or stuck his head in an oven.

27:04.368 --> 27:05.986
He wouldn't have done it like this.

27:06.085 --> 27:07.097
There's no way.

27:07.163 --> 27:09.730
We can't be 100% sure
about anything, Benji,

27:09.797 --> 27:11.897
unless we see it with our own eyes.

27:11.963 --> 27:13.163
Well, where's the gun then?

27:14.683 --> 27:16.530
See, you don't get it, Sheriff.

27:16.597 --> 27:18.730
George didn't have no backbone.

27:18.797 --> 27:21.362
Ever since he was a little
boy, you could see that.

27:22.303 --> 27:25.163
And there was nothing I could
do to give him one neither.

27:29.563 --> 27:31.630
Well, I appreciate you talking with me

27:31.697 --> 27:32.930
under these circumstances.

27:35.130 --> 27:38.263
And, again, I'm awful sorry for your loss.

27:39.330 --> 27:41.663
I'd check in on Trey Willis if I was you.

27:43.404 --> 27:44.730
Why's that?

27:45.556 --> 27:47.763
He came by looking for George a while back,

27:48.213 --> 27:50.130
but something about it smelled.

27:50.197 --> 27:52.097
Could you be more specific?

27:52.163 --> 27:54.763
Not really. Something smells, it smells.

27:58.863 --> 28:03.097
Well, if anything more comes
to mind, give me a call.

28:03.163 --> 28:05.663
Oh, you done made up your mind anyway.

28:19.030 --> 28:20.630
Hello?

28:20.697 --> 28:21.830
In here.

28:29.012 --> 28:30.294
Tornado?

28:31.197 --> 28:33.497
I'm looking for Daniel's
social security card.

28:34.563 --> 28:35.597
What are you up to?

28:40.130 --> 28:41.830
Why is Daniel at my apartment?

28:44.063 --> 28:45.406
I don't know, honey.

28:46.230 --> 28:48.197
I guess he wanted a change.

28:49.540 --> 28:51.233
Okay, well...

28:51.763 --> 28:54.897
I was kind of hoping to get on with my life

28:54.963 --> 28:57.530
now that everything's been decided,

28:57.597 --> 29:00.130
not baby-sit a 38-year-old,
convicted murderer.

29:00.600 --> 29:02.740
Everything hasn't been decided, Amantha.

29:03.994 --> 29:04.897
What do you mean, mom?

29:05.727 --> 29:07.698
We don't even know what
state he's gonna live in.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.497
I don't know what state
he's in now, Mother.

29:13.017 --> 29:14.030
Look, you don't have to do anything

29:14.097 --> 29:16.430
other than let him stay
there for a little while.

29:16.497 --> 29:17.563
Of course, Mother.

29:17.630 --> 29:19.030
What's another 20 years?

29:23.997 --> 29:25.690
Jon came by.

29:28.120 --> 29:30.692
You're not gonna tell me why
Daniel's not living here?

29:32.207 --> 29:33.597
I don't want to talk about it.

29:34.730 --> 29:35.682
Okay, mom.

29:37.730 --> 29:39.196
You want to talk about the kitchen?

29:57.430 --> 29:59.010
Just one more thing.

29:59.110 --> 30:00.297
Of course, sir.

30:16.397 --> 30:18.863
That's $27.14, sir.

30:37.717 --> 30:39.127
$23.23.

30:47.397 --> 30:49.097
Sir, if I may?

30:49.528 --> 30:50.393
Yes?

30:50.573 --> 30:53.413
You're paying for, well, convenience here.

30:53.513 --> 30:54.763
If you have the time,

30:54.830 --> 30:57.363
one of the larger grocery
stores would allow...

30:57.430 --> 31:00.130
More bang for your buck,
I believe is the phrase.

31:06.449 --> 31:07.830
Perhaps I'll just...

31:11.844 --> 31:13.363
Take the doughnuts.

31:13.430 --> 31:14.863

No, I just...

Wanted to see how you're doing, I guess.

32:47.521 --> 32:48.754
You want to eat Tawney's ribs?

What?

32:58.687 --> 33:00.921
Hello?

33:03.221 --> 33:04.454
Daniel?

33:07.421 --> 33:09.754
I figured out how to use your stereo.

33:09.821 --> 33:11.654
I hear that.

33:11.721 --> 33:12.987
Too loud?

33:13.054 --> 33:15.021
Got a bit of a headache.

33:19.321 --> 33:20.921
I'm sorry.

33:20.987 --> 33:24.987
Found this station in Macon
down low on your FM dial.

33:25.054 --> 33:29.021
The deejay... or the curator
would be more accurate...

33:29.087 --> 33:34.021
He's like 142, perfectly affected voice.

33:34.087 --> 33:38.854
Telling little backstories
about each composer.

33:40.187 --> 33:41.887
You know, when you think of a person

33:41.954 --> 33:47.821
who has dedicated their life to
sharing the talents of others

33:47.887 --> 33:51.954
with the world with no rancor or envy...

33:57.887 --> 33:59.554
Is that beautiful?

34:02.221 --> 34:03.987
It's nice, yes.

34:06.287 --> 34:07.721
Anyway, I hope you're hungry.

34:07.787 --> 34:09.987
I have prepared a nostalgic meal...

34:10.054 --> 34:11.721
I.E., not healthy.

34:11.786 --> 34:13.821
Please tell me you haven't eaten.

34:13.887 --> 34:15.654
I haven't eaten.

34:15.721 --> 34:17.821
Good, well, uh, take a seat,

34:17.887 --> 34:21.254
and I will call for you
when dinner is served.

34:28.621 --> 34:31.587
Would you care for an aperitif?

34:33.286 --> 34:34.920
I'm good. Thanks.

34:34.987 --> 34:37.054
So am I.

34:55.786 --> 34:57.687
Heard Daniel flew the Coop.

34:57.754 --> 34:59.221
I think he's at Amantha's.

35:02.087 --> 35:03.621
You know what that means?

35:03.687 --> 35:06.003
- What what means?
- Flew the Coop.

35:06.374 --> 35:08.413
Isn't a Coop where chickens live?

35:12.487 --> 35:14.121
Never thought about it like that.

35:16.287 --> 35:18.554
You know why he flew the Coop?

35:18.621 --> 35:21.221
Not really. Everybody talks around stuff.

35:21.287 --> 35:23.443
Can't figure out what they're
saying half the time.

35:32.721 --> 35:35.054
You got your learner's permit?

35:35.121 --> 35:39.554
Yeah.

35:39.621 --> 35:41.330
Let's go for a ride.

35:41.887 --> 35:43.337
Where to?

35:45.188 --> 35:47.852
You don't need a destination
when you're a teenager.

35:48.237 --> 35:49.963
You do it for the thrill.

35:50.421 --> 35:51.787
A thrill ride?

35:51.854 --> 35:53.754
Could be.

35:54.338 --> 35:55.557
Who knows?

36:05.995 --> 36:08.911
Dinner tonight will be all-beef Franks

36:09.011 --> 36:11.928
with a chili topping, a
side of the tater of tots,

36:11.995 --> 36:15.475
and chef's surprise for dessert.

36:17.056 --> 36:18.625
Certainly brings back memories.

36:18.798 --> 36:21.731
Well, there was a time when
this was all you would eat.

36:22.898 --> 36:23.819
Sounds about right.

36:24.731 --> 36:27.031
So, how was your day, sister?

36:27.098 --> 36:28.865
Oh...

36:28.931 --> 36:30.531
Let's not get into that.

36:30.941 --> 36:32.345
Fair enough.

36:32.445 --> 36:33.931
Mine, you ask? Well, I...

36:34.866 --> 36:36.647
Did a light load of laundry,

36:36.746 --> 36:40.065
I went shopping, and
acquired gainful employment.

36:42.098 --> 36:43.365
Doing what?

36:43.431 --> 36:44.497
Painting a pool.

36:44.597 --> 36:48.098
I'm a pool painter under
the employ of one Melvin.

36:56.598 --> 36:58.765
Are you okay?

37:00.131 --> 37:02.265
Jon and I are getting a
divorce, so to speak.

37:04.331 --> 37:05.931
I'm sorry to hear that.

37:05.998 --> 37:08.598
It was a marriage of convenience anyway.

37:11.531 --> 37:13.831
And it's no longer convenient.

37:19.031 --> 37:22.264
This is all very thoughtful,
Daniel, but I...

37:23.798 --> 37:26.298
Just can't pretend that I give a shit.

37:47.465 --> 37:49.398
Janet said you were at a girl's last night.

37:49.465 --> 37:51.067
Yep. That's where I was.

37:53.131 --> 37:54.731
She got a name, this girl?

37:54.798 --> 37:56.265
Claire.

37:56.331 --> 37:58.765
I declare.

38:00.931 --> 38:02.631
You like her?

38:02.698 --> 38:04.143
As a friend.

38:05.065 --> 38:07.064
Would you like me to stop
asking you questions?

38:07.065 --> 38:09.398
I wouldn't mind it.

38:12.765 --> 38:14.665
Hang a right up here.

38:22.165 --> 38:23.365
I asked a girl out

38:23.431 --> 38:25.831
the first night I could legally drive.

38:26.600 --> 38:28.133
Her name was Julie.

38:28.865 --> 38:30.451
Sweet Julie.

38:31.031 --> 38:32.357
Julie who?

38:35.365 --> 38:37.226
She... she doesn't live here anymore.

38:38.968 --> 38:40.165
Sweet Julie had, um...

38:40.931 --> 38:43.402
A reputation, I guess you might say.

38:44.431 --> 38:46.131
Claire have a reputation?

38:46.198 --> 38:48.065
Not that kind.

38:48.131 --> 38:50.065
Good for her.

38:50.131 --> 38:51.331
Keep straight.

38:51.398 --> 38:53.531
When I asked her out,

38:53.598 --> 38:56.498
Julie was a little guarded
at first, but I was like,

38:56.565 --> 38:58.298
"look, I like you, you know,

38:58.365 --> 38:59.831
I want to get to know you better."

38:59.898 --> 39:01.365
She believe you?

39:01.431 --> 39:03.198
You know what they say.

39:03.265 --> 39:05.398
Hope springs eternal.

39:05.465 --> 39:07.165
Anyway...

39:07.231 --> 39:08.565
I took her to the Pizza Barn, right,

39:08.631 --> 39:09.831
which was a big deal back then.

39:09.898 --> 39:12.198
That was before Pizza Hut showed up

39:12.265 --> 39:15.731
and blew them out of the water,
which I still don't get.

39:15.798 --> 39:18.198
And we had the, uh...

39:18.265 --> 39:20.731
We had the Big Barn Supremo.

39:20.798 --> 39:22.331
It was about the size of a tire

39:22.398 --> 39:23.898
you'd put on one of them priuses.

39:24.431 --> 39:27.165
And I asked her about her
brother and her sisters

39:27.231 --> 39:29.165
and her classes and stuff like that,

39:29.231 --> 39:31.064
buttering her up, you know?

39:31.731 --> 39:33.699
It's a lot like sales, really.

39:34.398 --> 39:36.098
All right, slow down.

39:36.165 --> 39:37.165
Why?

39:37.231 --> 39:38.631
Slow down, slow down.

39:38.698 --> 39:40.065
You're gonna pull over right up here.

39:51.765 --> 39:53.698
Put it in park and kill the engine.

40:06.665 --> 40:08.165
Now, where was I?

40:10.265 --> 40:11.587
You were buttering her up.

40:14.231 --> 40:18.765
- You know the, um, the new Kroger is at?
- Yeah.

40:18.831 --> 40:20.631
That's where we used to go
parking back in the day.

40:20.698 --> 40:22.304
No shit?

40:22.484 --> 40:26.898
Before it was the Kroger,
it was Lovers' Lane.

40:26.965 --> 40:29.829
Really, just an overgrown
triple lot on the edge of town.

40:30.065 --> 40:32.465
That's where I took her
after the Pizza Barn.

40:32.531 --> 40:36.134
She was a little disappointed at the detour

40:36.188 --> 40:38.663
but not totally surprised.

40:41.698 --> 40:43.165
We made out some.

40:44.365 --> 40:45.959
She was a sweet little kisser.

40:47.139 --> 40:50.470
And that's... that's about as far
as she wanted to go, really.

40:51.831 --> 40:54.233
But I had my mind set on doing it.

40:55.265 --> 40:57.135
You know, getting it over with.

40:57.898 --> 41:00.615
I mean, that's how I
looked at it at the time.

41:02.900 --> 41:06.254
Anyway things progressed.

41:06.565 --> 41:08.498
We did a little car wrestling.

41:08.996 --> 41:12.831
I mean, she wasn't beautiful
like Tawney, you know,

41:12.898 --> 41:14.598
but...

41:14.665 --> 41:16.031
She was cute enough.

41:16.098 --> 41:18.198
Had a sweet disposition, too.

41:18.265 --> 41:21.265
Probably her downfall
when you think about it.

41:23.431 --> 41:24.590
Uh-oh.

41:25.365 --> 41:28.331
This could be awkward.

41:28.979 --> 41:30.231
Should we go?

41:30.298 --> 41:31.731
Mnh-mnh. Don't move.

41:40.798 --> 41:41.797
That wouldn't have been good.

41:44.933 --> 41:48.098
So, are... are we, like,
stalking or something?

41:49.265 --> 41:51.390
Oh, who knows these days?

41:55.465 --> 41:57.623
Looks like they're about
to sit down and eat.

41:58.331 --> 42:00.898
Let's just sit here for a while.

42:03.165 --> 42:04.714
So, what happened?

42:05.331 --> 42:06.698
With you and Julie?

42:09.931 --> 42:11.281
What do you think happened?

42:13.098 --> 42:17.565
I mean, I didn't, you know,
make her do it, force her.

42:17.998 --> 42:19.747
Date-rape her or whatever.

42:20.598 --> 42:21.884
Just kept at it.

42:22.665 --> 42:26.401
Second base, third base, back to first.

42:27.331 --> 42:29.098
Told her I wouldn't tell anybody.

42:30.165 --> 42:32.489
Like, "pretty, pretty please, Julie.

42:33.265 --> 42:34.603
Pretty, pretty please."

42:35.969 --> 42:38.731
You know, she asked me if that's
the only reason you asked me out.

42:38.798 --> 42:40.098
I was like, "no, hell no.

42:40.165 --> 42:42.065
I asked you out 'cause I like you.

42:42.131 --> 42:45.931
Pretty, pretty please, Julie,
pretty, pretty please?"

42:47.865 --> 42:50.398
And then, finally, she just
let out a big ol' sigh

42:50.465 --> 42:51.931
and gave in.

42:54.465 --> 42:55.447
Let me have it.

43:00.465 --> 43:02.198
Did you ever tell anybody?

43:06.792 --> 43:10.465
Don't ever do that to Claire,
Jared, or any other girl.

43:11.490 --> 43:12.700
I'm not gonna do that.

43:13.065 --> 43:14.398
Yeah, 'cause those...

43:14.465 --> 43:16.898
Those guys who make you feel like a pussy

43:16.965 --> 43:18.297
'cause you ain't got your cherry popped,

43:19.131 --> 43:20.646
they're just a bunch of assholes.

43:21.698 --> 43:23.773
And in 10 years, you ain't
gonna know most of 'em.

43:25.531 --> 43:26.623
You know that?

43:26.965 --> 43:28.011
I do know that.

43:35.065 --> 43:36.878
You know when I told you
you wasn't like him?

43:37.805 --> 43:39.105
Like Daniel?

43:41.665 --> 43:43.098
I remember.

43:43.165 --> 43:45.302
You're not like me either.

43:49.955 --> 43:51.665
And that's a good thing.

43:55.831 --> 43:57.573
About ready to go back?

44:06.298 --> 44:07.634
Let's just stay here a little while longer.
