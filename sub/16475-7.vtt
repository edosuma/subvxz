WEBVTT

00:00.220 --> 00:02.300
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are gathered here today

00:02.373 --> 00:03.851
to answer and age-old question.

00:03.892 --> 00:06.000
Right, what's Amy's deal?
She single?

00:06.052 --> 00:07.664
No, we're dating. Come on.

00:07.689 --> 00:08.765
The question is:

00:08.796 --> 00:10.022
Who here does
the best impression

00:10.046 --> 00:11.398
of captain Raymond Holt?

00:11.468 --> 00:12.718
You'll be judged on voice,

00:12.750 --> 00:14.734
body language,
and overall lack of flair.

00:14.851 --> 00:16.679
Everyone will perform
the same scenario:

00:16.757 --> 00:18.508
Captain Holt
eating a marshmallow

00:18.594 --> 00:19.626
for the very first time.

00:19.680 --> 00:21.930
Let the Holt-off begin!

00:22.032 --> 00:25.618
What is this glutinous
monstrosity before me?

00:25.692 --> 00:27.571
The sugar in this
is quite sweet.

00:27.680 --> 00:31.563
Ooh, mm-hmm, mm-hmm-hmm-hmm!

00:31.626 --> 00:32.508
That's your Holt impression?

00:32.509 --> 00:33.610
I can hear him doing that.

00:33.665 --> 00:36.305
Looks like a sticky pillow.

00:36.376 --> 00:38.602
I don't care for it.
Classical music.

00:38.696 --> 00:39.760
[laughter]

00:39.805 --> 00:41.320
What's going on here?
What are you doing?

00:41.344 --> 00:43.844
Captain, hey, nothing,
just eating some marshmallows.

00:43.899 --> 00:44.828
Care for one?

00:44.923 --> 00:46.839
Marshed-mallow.

00:48.665 --> 00:53.128
Hmm. Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm! [laughing]

00:53.214 --> 00:54.097
I knew it!

01:14.426 --> 01:15.707
That concludes our briefing.

01:15.762 --> 01:17.307
And now, on a personal note,

01:17.332 --> 01:19.122
I have some thoughts
about Beyoncé's "Lemonade"

01:19.137 --> 01:20.631
- I'd like to share.
- Oh, my God, sir,

01:20.655 --> 01:22.285
As much as I want
to hear those thoughts,

01:22.317 --> 01:24.998
and it is so, so much,
I think we should

01:25.234 --> 01:26.885
probably let Amy speak.

01:27.551 --> 01:30.387
Oh, Santiago,
the floor is yours.

01:30.442 --> 01:32.495
Thank you.
Okay, here's everyone's

01:32.549 --> 01:34.926
itineraries for Thanksgiving
at my place.

01:35.043 --> 01:36.722
I know a lot of your families
are out of town,

01:36.746 --> 01:38.941
and you just want to relax.
But I think we'll all enjoy

01:38.996 --> 01:40.800
ourselves more if we
rigidly stick to the schedule.

01:40.824 --> 01:43.894
Whoa, did you assign us
individual bathroom break times?

01:43.949 --> 01:45.049
Keep asking questions
about it, sarge,

01:45.050 --> 01:46.511
and your slot is after Scully's.

01:46.566 --> 01:47.957
All right, Santiago, damn.

01:48.011 --> 01:48.862
It's your toilet.

01:48.902 --> 01:50.410
Sorry, it's just that

01:50.472 --> 01:53.785
my dad is coming into town
and he can be a little uptight.

01:53.825 --> 01:55.832
Uh-oh, Santiago's
calling someone uptight.

01:55.857 --> 01:56.699
That can't be good.

01:56.744 --> 01:58.619
He's not crazy.
He's just the kind of guy

01:58.644 --> 02:00.057
who arranges the money
in his wallet

02:00.089 --> 02:01.097
according to serial number.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.806
Yeah. That kind of guy.

02:02.831 --> 02:03.988
Boyle, are you set
on the Turkey?

02:04.012 --> 02:06.081
This year's bird will be
as moist as...

02:06.120 --> 02:08.088
- Nope.
- As juicy as...

02:08.127 --> 02:10.259
- Nope.
- As wet as you can...

02:10.315 --> 02:12.502
Boyle, just say
it'll be good, man.

02:12.557 --> 02:14.229
It'll be good, man.

02:14.307 --> 02:16.581
Well, I gotta go
start getting ready.

02:16.651 --> 02:17.986
Don't be late
or I'll slit your throats.

02:18.010 --> 02:19.182
[laughs]

02:19.245 --> 02:20.994
You don't have to fake laugh.
We know you mean it.

02:21.018 --> 02:22.453
Good.

02:23.924 --> 02:27.245
So, meeting Amy's dad
for the first time, huh?

02:27.326 --> 02:29.010
- You nervous?
- Yeah, a little.

02:29.112 --> 02:32.221
- I was talking to Jake.
- No, sarge, I am not nervous.

02:32.307 --> 02:34.197
I'm confident that I'll make
a great first impression

02:34.221 --> 02:37.092
On Mr. Victor Santiago.

02:37.213 --> 02:38.579
Why'd you do it
with a British accent?

02:38.603 --> 02:39.635
I felt like
doing the Cuban accent

02:39.659 --> 02:40.736
would be a little dicey for me.

02:40.760 --> 02:41.760
- Very good call.
- Yeah.

02:41.799 --> 02:43.229
My advice:
Don't be overconfident.

02:43.315 --> 02:44.452
The first time
I met Kevin's parents,

02:44.476 --> 02:46.406
I called brahm's "funf gesange"

02:46.424 --> 02:51.588
- Opus 106
- when it is, obviously, opus 104.

02:51.682 --> 02:52.867
They haven't spoken to me since.

02:52.891 --> 02:53.979
Really? Just for that?

02:54.019 --> 02:56.409
Yes... Also because
they're huge homophobes

02:56.458 --> 02:59.085
who think that I made Kevin gay
with my magic genitalia.

02:59.120 --> 03:01.135
That's super sad,
but I do like hearing you say

03:01.174 --> 03:02.174
the word "genitalia."

03:02.221 --> 03:04.463
Well, I am ready for this.

03:04.870 --> 03:07.346
I pulled a full Amy and
researched the crap out of him.

03:07.409 --> 03:08.581
Made this sweet binder.

03:08.635 --> 03:11.104
Just a couple of factoids
about Victor:

03:11.213 --> 03:13.252
He's an ex-cop, 65 years old,

03:13.284 --> 03:16.299
married for 36 years, Cuban,
his favorite food...

03:16.377 --> 03:18.172
Flavor first beefy dog food.

03:18.266 --> 03:19.443
Wait, no, sorry.

03:19.485 --> 03:20.805
That's his dog's favorite food.

03:20.846 --> 03:22.976
His favorite food is...

03:23.188 --> 03:24.360
Corn.

03:24.483 --> 03:26.594
Makes more sense.
Dog food's not in the name.

03:26.703 --> 03:29.492
I know everything about him,
therefore I know exactly

03:29.547 --> 03:31.267
the type of person I need to be
in order for him to think

03:31.291 --> 03:33.786
- I'm good enough for Amy.
- No, Jake, you're fine.

03:33.860 --> 03:35.196
Just flash him your baby Browns,

03:35.242 --> 03:36.823
he'll love it. Just be yourself.

03:36.828 --> 03:38.438
Be myself?
Charles, I have one day

03:38.469 --> 03:40.180
to win over Amy's dad.
How long did it take

03:40.235 --> 03:41.180
before you guys
started liking me?

03:41.242 --> 03:42.446
- Couple weeks.
- Six months.

03:42.516 --> 03:44.411
- Jury's still out.
- See, Charles?

03:44.492 --> 03:46.375
"Be myself," what kind of
garbage advice is that?

03:46.399 --> 03:47.843
I hope you're not telling
Nikolaj that crap.

03:47.867 --> 03:48.648
[correcting]
- Nikolaj.

03:48.673 --> 03:49.673
Ugh.

03:49.703 --> 03:52.404
[classical music playing]

03:52.461 --> 03:54.227
Okay, we're running out of time.

03:54.321 --> 03:57.071
What do you guys like better:
Classic bishop hat fold

03:57.102 --> 03:59.805
or crown fold?
Now, the crown is more showy,

03:59.836 --> 04:02.117
But the bishop hat
has a certain dignity.

04:02.164 --> 04:04.235
I'll kill myself
if it's not the crown fold.

04:04.297 --> 04:06.657
Oh, okay, thanks.

04:07.203 --> 04:09.203
Sometimes you have to pretend
to care about napkins

04:09.258 --> 04:11.555
to stop hearing about napkins.

04:11.630 --> 04:13.763
Sorry I'm late, guys.

04:13.899 --> 04:15.521
Had to get my ax sharpened.

04:15.615 --> 04:17.767
Why do you have an ax?
Also, nice ax.

04:17.769 --> 04:19.021
Thank you. It's for the Turkey,

04:19.123 --> 04:20.677
So I can chop its head off
when it gets here.

04:20.701 --> 04:22.849
- Chop its head off?
- I ordered a live Turkey.

04:22.904 --> 04:25.076
It's being delivered.
Because you know what they say:

04:25.177 --> 04:27.973
The yummiest Turkey is the one
that just died in your hands.

04:27.998 --> 04:30.029
Charles, you can't
kill an animal in here.

04:30.107 --> 04:31.232
That's horrible.
It's disgusting.

04:31.256 --> 04:32.216
We won't let you do it,
right, Amy?

04:32.217 --> 04:34.047
It's getting late.
Don't make a mess.

04:34.052 --> 04:36.112
Relax. It's not the first Turkey

04:36.121 --> 04:37.855
I've killed
in a friend's bathtub.

04:38.004 --> 04:38.965
It isn't?

04:39.019 --> 04:42.066
<i>And now back to the Lexington
Thanksgiving day dog show.</i>

04:42.121 --> 04:44.066
Oh, look at her.
Sloping, clean-cut,

04:44.105 --> 04:45.722
forequarters, cocksure gait.

04:45.777 --> 04:47.027
She's majestic,

04:47.144 --> 04:48.316
and she knows it.

04:48.433 --> 04:51.902
- Pimento's here.
- Ah, Adrian.

04:52.058 --> 04:53.832
So you made it.
Happy Thanksgiving.

04:53.909 --> 04:54.917
Is it?

04:54.957 --> 04:56.863
Something wrong?

04:56.933 --> 04:58.144
Feel no pressure
to talk about it.

04:58.168 --> 04:59.686
Brass says
I can't rejoin the force.

04:59.777 --> 05:02.580
Some crap about you can't
just disappear from your job

05:02.605 --> 05:04.555
for seven months.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

05:04.680 --> 05:05.817
Oh, well, that's unfortunate.

05:05.841 --> 05:07.617
I know how much
being a cop meant to you.

05:07.672 --> 05:08.919
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.352
I guess I could be a teacher.

05:10.547 --> 05:11.656
"Sorry, Travis, the answer's

05:11.680 --> 05:13.781
"obviously Istanbul.
What did you say to me?

05:13.848 --> 05:17.227
"No, maybe you're wasting
your life.

05:17.375 --> 05:19.039
"Sorry, principal ramos,
I didn't see you there.

05:19.063 --> 05:21.766
"Wait, Travis is your son?
Hah, well, I guess you're

05:21.844 --> 05:27.055
"just gonna have to fire me.
Fired? Me? How dare you, sir.

05:27.141 --> 05:28.898
We will settle..."
see, it just wouldn't work.

05:28.922 --> 05:30.977
Hmm. You know, I had a friend

05:31.031 --> 05:32.778
that had to retire
from the force.

05:32.813 --> 05:34.607
He became
a private investigator.

05:34.664 --> 05:35.813
Ooh, PI, huh?

05:35.859 --> 05:37.258
- Mm.
- I like that.

05:37.313 --> 05:39.626
[laughs] "hello, Mr. Branville",

05:39.797 --> 05:41.508
"I found out where
your wife's been going tonight.

05:41.532 --> 05:43.149
"Have a seat,
you're not gonna like this.

05:43.251 --> 05:44.962
"She's cheating on you.

05:45.079 --> 05:46.141
"What do you mean
you knew that already?

05:46.165 --> 05:47.344
"You killed her?

05:47.430 --> 05:49.212
And are framing me
for the murder?"

05:49.329 --> 05:51.383
"I just left my prints
all over the crime scene.

05:51.462 --> 05:53.039
Oh, you are an evil ge..."

05:53.087 --> 05:55.383
This... this I could
get on board for.

05:55.493 --> 05:56.493
- Hmm.
- Only problem is,

05:56.532 --> 05:58.476
PI license is like, two grand.

05:58.501 --> 05:59.797
I could lend you the money.

05:59.876 --> 06:01.555
Think of it as an investment

06:01.641 --> 06:03.251
from someone
who believes in you.

06:03.351 --> 06:05.359
Wow, thanks, captain.
That means every...

06:05.399 --> 06:08.546
Whoa, hang on, you carry
a check book with you?

06:08.587 --> 06:10.484
'Course, you never know when
you're gonna need groceries.

06:10.508 --> 06:11.743
So cool.

06:11.768 --> 06:13.212
[beeping] - where are you?

06:13.274 --> 06:14.848
Picking up Amy's dad
at the airport.

06:14.922 --> 06:16.813
<i>Ooh, that's a strong move.</i>

06:16.821 --> 06:18.038
Have you successfully
changed everything

06:18.062 --> 06:19.571
about yourself as planned?

06:19.618 --> 06:20.883
Oh, yeah, you wouldn't
recognize me.

06:20.907 --> 06:23.344
I'm wearing a sweater,
I bought new shoes,

06:23.391 --> 06:25.415
I put something on my face
called "moisturizer."

06:25.477 --> 06:26.844
It's amazing.
Did you clean your car?

06:26.868 --> 06:28.165
I did, but it didn't
really take.

06:28.190 --> 06:30.164
So I just rented a new one.
But here's the best part:

06:30.188 --> 06:32.204
I printed out a sign
especially for him using

06:32.266 --> 06:34.813
his favorite font, Garamond.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.172
Who has a favorite font?

06:36.251 --> 06:38.609
The santiagos do. All of them.

06:38.751 --> 06:40.350
Oh, here he comes.
Gotta go, bye.

06:40.657 --> 06:41.977
Hey, Mr. Santiago.

06:42.008 --> 06:43.876
I am Jake Peralta,
Amy's boyfriend.

06:43.930 --> 06:45.582
Jake, nice to finally meet you.

06:45.633 --> 06:47.212
- You too.
- Ah, look at that.

06:47.391 --> 06:49.016
You're a garamond man, huh?

06:49.063 --> 06:51.227
Of course, what other font
would I use, Cambria?

06:51.296 --> 06:52.882
[laughter]

06:52.922 --> 06:55.915
Amy said you were a crack up,
but I had no idea.

06:55.954 --> 06:58.040
- Oh, it's working.
- What?

06:58.087 --> 06:59.267
Excuse me? Shall we?

06:59.315 --> 07:01.157
- Let me get your bag.
- Sure.

07:02.808 --> 07:04.517
The two hunks have arrived.

07:04.564 --> 07:06.868
Hi.

07:06.978 --> 07:08.485
So glad to have you here, dad.

07:08.540 --> 07:10.282
Happy to be here, tiger.

07:10.400 --> 07:11.922
- How was your flight?
- Oh, good, good, you know,

07:11.946 --> 07:14.446
- I did "The Times" crossword.
- Oh, great puzzle to do, right?

07:14.579 --> 07:16.728
- Oh, my God, 17 down?
- Oh, I know,

07:16.767 --> 07:19.142
- What about 16 across?
- What about 34 across?

07:19.181 --> 07:20.821
Oh, what about 45 down?

07:20.826 --> 07:22.196
Both: What about 20 across?

07:22.221 --> 07:23.717
[laughter]

07:23.819 --> 07:25.076
- I also did it.
- Yeah.

07:25.147 --> 07:27.826
So Jake and I had a great
conversation on the way here.

07:27.881 --> 07:30.287
You didn't tell me he was so
interested in mutual funds.

07:30.412 --> 07:31.787
Uh...

07:31.834 --> 07:33.312
Yeah, ugh,
Amy is so bored of hearing me

07:33.336 --> 07:36.865
Talk about allocation,
asset mix, attribution analysis.

07:36.909 --> 07:38.646
These are just terms
I throw around all the time.

07:38.670 --> 07:39.756
in alphabetical order.

07:39.811 --> 07:41.209
Well, that's just
how my brain works.

07:41.233 --> 07:42.894
I mean, how would you list
financial terms,

07:42.918 --> 07:44.748
in random order?
What are you, crazy?

07:44.858 --> 07:46.557
He's got a point.
I like this guy.

07:46.558 --> 07:47.897
[laughs] yeah.

07:48.030 --> 07:49.990
Oh! Captain Holt.

07:50.037 --> 07:51.115
This is my dad.

07:51.153 --> 07:52.865
- Captain, heard a lot about you.
- And I you.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.443
Do you mind passing me
those crab puffs?

07:54.467 --> 07:56.092
Oh, certainly. There you go.

07:56.147 --> 07:56.995
Thank you.

07:57.020 --> 07:58.390
Yeah.

07:59.941 --> 08:02.610
That was everything.

08:02.635 --> 08:03.842
Yeah, pretty big night:

08:03.889 --> 08:06.013
The three most important men
in your life under one roof.

08:06.037 --> 08:07.420
Well, will shorts isn't here.

08:07.445 --> 08:09.420
Oh. Burn on Holt... Probably.

08:09.490 --> 08:10.795
That's the one
you were talking about.

08:10.819 --> 08:13.295
<i>The cairn terrier
is intelligent and inquisitive</i>

08:13.373 --> 08:14.472
<i>with a bold personality.</i>

08:14.480 --> 08:16.389
[chuckles] "a bold personality."

08:16.448 --> 08:17.850
We know what that's code for:

08:17.928 --> 08:18.959
You're the bitch.

08:18.984 --> 08:21.733
Pimento is back.
How's the dog show going?

08:21.787 --> 08:23.100
Well,
it's not without its drama.

08:23.154 --> 08:25.193
Whoever groomed the Irish setter
might want to think about

08:25.217 --> 08:26.607
- blowing his brains out.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.397
How's that wire fox terrier?

08:28.428 --> 08:30.201
- Still in the lead?
- In the lead?

08:30.295 --> 08:32.693
- I doubt she even wins her group.
- What?

08:32.765 --> 08:36.092
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no,
don't say that!

08:36.193 --> 08:38.150
What? She's not gonna win?

08:38.227 --> 08:41.994
Ooh, I bet the check you gave me
on the wire fox terrier to win.

08:42.080 --> 08:43.530
Why would you do that?

08:43.570 --> 08:45.572
That money was to help you
get a PI license.

08:45.633 --> 08:47.422
Yeah, but I wanted to
pay you back fast.

08:47.508 --> 08:49.445
You made it sound like
the terrier was a sure thing.

08:49.469 --> 08:50.711
You said she was majestic.

08:50.750 --> 08:51.879
They're all majestic.

08:51.906 --> 08:53.992
This is a nationally-televised
dog show.

08:54.031 --> 08:55.061
This is the big time.

08:55.086 --> 08:56.914
Listen, mister,
I didn't give you that money

08:56.977 --> 08:58.773
So you could throw it away.
I want it back.

08:58.898 --> 09:00.023
We're gonna
pay your bookie a visit.

09:00.047 --> 09:01.211
- What?
- And so help me God,

09:01.236 --> 09:03.508
you better hope I don't miss
the "In Memoriam."

09:03.594 --> 09:05.242
If it's dead dogs you wanna see,

09:05.320 --> 09:07.664
I know where to get my hands on
dozens of them.

09:07.773 --> 09:09.430
All right, choo-choo!

09:09.453 --> 09:11.742
Here comes the veggie train,
leaving the station.

09:11.781 --> 09:13.430
Next stop, a healthy body.

09:13.516 --> 09:15.799
Terry has kids.
Just carrots for me.

09:15.843 --> 09:17.408
I don't eat celery,
hate the stuff.

09:17.433 --> 09:18.499
Oh, that's funny. Me too.

09:18.538 --> 09:19.897
Really? Get out of town.

09:19.936 --> 09:20.850
Even though everybody says...

09:20.875 --> 09:22.725
Both: They're basically
the same thing.

09:22.848 --> 09:24.082
[chuckling]

09:24.311 --> 09:26.233
I'm gonna go get a refill.
Do you want something?

09:26.335 --> 09:27.811
Oh, uh, you know,
if they have it,

09:27.850 --> 09:29.556
maybe, like, a dry Riesling?

09:29.616 --> 09:31.960
- Excellent choice.
- Thank you.

09:32.444 --> 09:34.249
They definitely have it.
I brought it.

09:34.397 --> 09:36.554
Wow, you are really
pulling this off.

09:36.624 --> 09:39.395
I know, all this research
is actually gonna work.

09:39.460 --> 09:40.740
Should I prepare for things
all the time?

09:40.764 --> 09:41.866
- Yeah.
- Nah, that's crazy.

09:41.929 --> 09:43.632
Look, I can't believe
you memorized

09:43.679 --> 09:44.850
that whole, huge binder.

09:44.903 --> 09:46.600
Oh, I didn't.
I brought it with me

09:46.632 --> 09:47.772
and hid it out on the stoop.

09:47.999 --> 09:49.663
So do you have
a favorite watchmaker?

09:49.718 --> 09:53.018
I do, but I actually have to
run to the bathroom real quick.

09:53.061 --> 09:55.218
<i>[seedy music]</i>

09:55.343 --> 09:57.179
Watches... Gotcha.

09:57.211 --> 09:58.828
I guess if I had to pick
one watch,

09:58.898 --> 10:00.225
It would be Nomos Glashutte.

10:00.250 --> 10:02.164
It's a German company
based in saxony.

10:02.195 --> 10:03.557
Speaking of which,
I think I just dropped

10:03.558 --> 10:05.508
a bit of a Glashutte
in the Baño.

10:05.703 --> 10:06.703
Steer clear.

10:06.734 --> 10:08.366
The only downside is,
I've told him I have to pee

10:08.390 --> 10:09.906
so much he thinks I have a UTI.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.561
I wonder if he's ever had a UTI.

10:11.687 --> 10:12.810
You know what,
I'm gonna sneak outside

10:12.834 --> 10:15.593
and get the 411 on the UTI. BRB.

10:15.648 --> 10:17.211
He loves abbreviations.

10:17.312 --> 10:19.999
<i>♪ ♪</i>

10:20.117 --> 10:22.774
Hey, Jake. You looking for this?

10:22.883 --> 10:25.687
What? Oh, no.

10:25.914 --> 10:27.633
Boyle, your Turkey's here.

10:27.672 --> 10:30.023
All right, let's do this.

10:30.133 --> 10:31.828
Pretty cool, huh?

10:31.914 --> 10:33.601
I feel like Dexter. I think.

10:33.711 --> 10:34.976
I never actually saw the show.

10:35.070 --> 10:36.406
Billboard gave me nightmares.

10:36.508 --> 10:38.589
Charles, are you crazy?

10:38.628 --> 10:41.385
No, I don't want to watch
a living animal die

10:41.431 --> 10:42.681
and then consume its flesh.

10:42.760 --> 10:44.166
How is this different
than eating a Turkey

10:44.190 --> 10:45.386
that's been killed in a factory?

10:45.410 --> 10:46.784
Because I don't
have to see that.

10:46.831 --> 10:48.720
It's called
living in denial, you Moron.

10:48.814 --> 10:51.845
Gina, I know it seems cruel,
but it's a swift death.

10:51.939 --> 10:53.588
One painless chop
removes the head.

10:53.613 --> 10:54.829
I mean, that doesn't
sound so bad.

10:54.853 --> 10:56.400
And then its decapitated
corpse only flops around

10:56.424 --> 10:58.549
for, like, half an hour.

10:58.588 --> 10:59.961
You know what?
You won't be able to

10:59.986 --> 11:02.205
go through with this if
I give this little guy a name.

11:02.283 --> 11:04.180
He's now Nikolaj.

11:04.205 --> 11:05.908
[gasps] that's my son's name.

11:05.978 --> 11:08.720
Go ahead, cut Nikolaj's throat.

11:08.830 --> 11:10.611
Sorry, Gina,
but we need a Turkey,

11:10.658 --> 11:12.260
and you're
the only one complaining.

11:12.377 --> 11:14.501
I don't like it either.
It's not a fair fight.

11:14.666 --> 11:16.282
Give the bird a gun,
then see what happens.

11:16.306 --> 11:17.595
Sarge, this must bother you too.

11:17.635 --> 11:20.283
Yeah, but eating
a big drumstick on Thanksgiving

11:20.330 --> 11:21.510
makes Terry feel like a king.

11:21.548 --> 11:23.095
Sorry,
but it's five against two.

11:23.158 --> 11:25.642
Wait, you assume Hitchcock
and I want to eat that Turkey?

11:25.752 --> 11:27.049
- Yeah...?
- Thank you.

11:27.103 --> 11:29.041
Charles, do what you need to do.

11:29.111 --> 11:30.345
Copy that.

11:30.416 --> 11:32.213
Uh-uh, no, hold up.

11:32.299 --> 11:34.213
- Rosa, get the bird.
- On it.

11:34.291 --> 11:37.822
I'll stand here and sacrifice
my life to Charles's bloodlust.

11:37.853 --> 11:39.267
I'm not gonna kill you, Gina.

11:39.306 --> 11:41.595
Huh, then you already lost.

11:41.908 --> 11:43.103
No, where are you going?

11:43.135 --> 11:45.314
Hey, you can run,
but you can't hide.

11:45.416 --> 11:48.095
The apartment will run red
with the blood of Nikolaj.

11:48.213 --> 11:49.791
Please stop calling him that.

11:51.220 --> 11:52.509
So, uh, what are you
doing out here?

11:52.533 --> 11:55.451
Sneaking a cigarette.
I just can't quit.

11:55.529 --> 11:57.604
But you knew that, didn't you?
Page 136.

11:57.629 --> 12:00.264
What is that strange book
you're holding?

12:00.303 --> 12:01.215
I've never seen it before.

12:01.233 --> 12:04.123
"Jake Peralta's guide to
tricking Amy's dad."

12:04.169 --> 12:05.483
What? Who put that there?

12:05.537 --> 12:06.779
Why did I use a title page?

12:06.816 --> 12:09.233
Relax, Jake, it's okay.
Actually, I'm quite impressed.

12:09.283 --> 12:10.754
- You are?
- Yeah, you did a ton

12:10.779 --> 12:12.162
of research here.
You made a binder.

12:12.186 --> 12:13.576
This is real Santiago stuff.

12:13.619 --> 12:16.350
Yeah, I-I guess it is.
I even used tabs.

12:16.375 --> 12:17.475
- The good ones.
- Yes.

12:17.506 --> 12:18.794
There are good and bad types
of tabs.

12:18.818 --> 12:20.193
That's something we all know.
I can't believe

12:20.217 --> 12:22.342
you did all this.
You've got my family tree,

12:22.404 --> 12:25.154
all of my case files,
lot of photos.

12:25.186 --> 12:26.475
Yes, and might I add,

12:26.537 --> 12:28.566
your ponytail in the 90s
puts Amy's to shame.

12:28.647 --> 12:29.834
They used to call me "the lion."

12:29.858 --> 12:31.139
Wow, cool nickname.

12:31.194 --> 12:33.053
They call me "The Barracuda."

12:33.209 --> 12:34.998
Well, I call me that.
I'm hoping it catches on.

12:35.022 --> 12:36.131
I was wondering
what you thought about

12:36.155 --> 12:38.174
one of my cases...

12:38.358 --> 12:39.776
First essex bank heist.

12:39.827 --> 12:41.233
Yes, I read that one.

12:41.311 --> 12:43.131
They got robbed the day before
their grand opening.

12:43.155 --> 12:44.913
I never solved that one.

12:45.108 --> 12:46.733
That bothered me for 20 years.

12:46.811 --> 12:48.715
But I see that you wrote
a note here that says,

12:48.788 --> 12:51.020
"contractor did it, so obvious."

12:51.059 --> 12:52.379
Ah! Oh, what?

12:52.457 --> 12:54.223
Well, you know us millennials,

12:54.278 --> 12:55.403
We're always exaggerating.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.661
But what I think
happened there is...

12:56.685 --> 12:58.480
Is that I was reading that file,
and I noticed

12:58.504 --> 13:00.278
that the contractor,
Russo, was the, um...

13:00.317 --> 13:02.918
- Obvious?
- Obvious suspect, but only

13:02.965 --> 13:04.113
in the sense that he was
the only one who could've

13:04.137 --> 13:05.550
possibly done it 'cause
he had the blueprint.

13:05.574 --> 13:07.926
I talked to Russo.
He had an alibi.

13:08.028 --> 13:09.773
Of course, of course.

13:09.918 --> 13:11.816
But, you know, the name of the
company was "Russo and sons,"

13:11.840 --> 13:16.043
So... I figure probably, maybe,
definitely the sons did it.

13:16.176 --> 13:18.114
Maybe. Probably. For sure.

13:18.395 --> 13:20.590
Sons? Oh, my God, the sons.

13:20.637 --> 13:21.660
I think you might be
on to something.

13:21.684 --> 13:22.684
- Really?
- I don't know

13:22.715 --> 13:24.121
How I missed that.

13:24.231 --> 13:25.558
I bet they still live
here in New York.

13:25.582 --> 13:26.964
We should go
talk to them right now.

13:26.988 --> 13:29.035
I mean, if that would be okay.

13:29.090 --> 13:30.049
"Okay," are you kidding me?

13:30.074 --> 13:31.653
I would love to work
a case with you.

13:31.715 --> 13:32.715
That's amazing.

13:32.778 --> 13:35.528
Looks like the lion is
gonna roar again.

13:35.668 --> 13:37.629
And the Barracuda is gonna...

13:37.731 --> 13:38.996
What?

13:39.192 --> 13:41.184

Your bookie lives
in a college dorm?

He's a freshman.
They don't let them

13:47.074 --> 13:50.184
Live off-campus first year. Doi.

13:50.590 --> 13:53.145
Hey, Adrian, come on in.
Happy Thanksgiving, man.

13:53.184 --> 13:54.364
Can it, Alan.

13:54.465 --> 13:56.293
Listen, I need the money back,

13:56.356 --> 13:57.324
and I need it back now.

13:57.364 --> 13:58.574
Aw, geez, I'm sorry.

13:58.606 --> 14:00.598
I can't do that.
I placed the bet online.

14:00.645 --> 14:01.691
It's not like I can cancel it.

14:01.715 --> 14:03.059
You just placed the bet online?

14:03.129 --> 14:04.598
Yeah.
He could've done it himself.

14:04.653 --> 14:05.653
It's really easy.

14:05.707 --> 14:07.683
I kept telling him there's
no need for bookies anymore.

14:07.707 --> 14:09.629
No, no, no, I don't mess
with computers, okay?

14:09.692 --> 14:12.473
Ever since I died of dysentery
on the Oregon trail, I was like,

14:12.520 --> 14:14.090
No thank you.
I'm done with this.

14:14.172 --> 14:16.058
Okay, look, the money's
already in the Caribbean.

14:16.082 --> 14:16.879
There's nothing I can do.

14:16.965 --> 14:18.175
Looks like we're going

14:18.176 --> 14:19.793
to the Caribbean.

14:19.864 --> 14:23.317
[imitates guitar riff]

14:23.418 --> 14:25.183
You do know we're not
going to the Caribbean, right?

14:25.207 --> 14:27.653
I didn't know that.
That is a bummer.

14:27.719 --> 14:29.690
[grunts] come on, guys.

14:29.715 --> 14:31.317
It's getting late.
Open the door.

14:31.356 --> 14:33.356
Not until you promise
to let this little Turkey

14:33.387 --> 14:35.426
