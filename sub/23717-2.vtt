WEBVTT

00:15.348 --> 00:17.225
WE HAVE A DATE, BUT SHE'S LATE

00:17.350 --> 00:19.769
Mom, bring me a glass of milk.

00:20.186 --> 00:22.814
Mom, I want a glass of milk.

00:22.939 --> 00:26.901
-Give me a glass of milk!
-Go get it yourself!

00:27.027 --> 00:30.155
You're always sitting at home,
drawing all this junk!

00:30.280 --> 00:32.282
Does drawing that stuff pay
for the food you eat?

00:32.407 --> 00:35.785
-Are you the son of a pig?
-No, he's my son.

00:38.830 --> 00:41.416
He can't even make enough money
to buy his own socks.

00:41.541 --> 00:44.586
I don't even expect to get
a gift from my sons.

00:44.711 --> 00:46.796
Stop all that junk!

00:47.422 --> 00:48.339
Junk?

00:48.673 --> 00:50.967
Have you ever bought me a tablet
to draw cartoons with?

00:51.092 --> 00:53.970
Hey! What did you just say?

00:54.095 --> 00:56.389
How can you say that to your mom?

00:56.806 --> 00:58.641
Okay, so this is how you're gonna be?

00:58.975 --> 01:01.311
Do you think I'm at home
because I've got nowhere to go?

01:04.189 --> 01:05.315
What? Hey!

01:09.486 --> 01:13.156
Just wait until I become famous.
You'll regret how you treat me now!

01:15.950 --> 01:18.411
You know Mom's birthday
is today, right? Don't be late.

01:19.454 --> 01:20.580
Mom's birthday!

01:20.955 --> 01:24.709
I don't even expect to get
a gift from my sons.

01:25.585 --> 01:30.006
You idiot!
How could you forget that?

01:30.131 --> 01:31.841
Just die!

01:33.051 --> 01:36.387
"From your son, Seok."

01:38.348 --> 01:41.893
Okay, leave this card here...

01:43.228 --> 01:45.396
And I need to hide.

01:48.066 --> 01:50.235
-Oh, she's here.
-What time is Jun coming home?

01:51.152 --> 01:53.988
He knows today's your birthday.
He'll be here soon.

01:54.114 --> 01:58.660
-Well...
-He likes food, so the cake will be...

02:03.123 --> 02:04.499
Oh, I'm tired.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.210
After she reads the card,
I'll go, "Ta-da!"

02:07.335 --> 02:08.753
DEAR MOM

02:11.464 --> 02:12.882
Hon, look at this.

02:13.883 --> 02:15.385
Oh, the candles!

02:17.637 --> 02:18.805
Dear Mom...

02:18.930 --> 02:21.057
Thank you for raising me.

02:21.182 --> 02:24.394
I can't live up to your expectations,
but please don't worry anymore.

02:24.519 --> 02:28.731
I'm sorry and thank you.
Your son, Seok.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.569
That idiot ran away from home!

02:33.695 --> 02:35.905
Were we too harsh on him this morning?

02:36.030 --> 02:37.991
But how could he run away
on his mother's birthday?

02:38.449 --> 02:40.368
What? Run away?

02:40.493 --> 02:42.162
I'll light the candles and go out.

02:44.372 --> 02:48.084
He must be too upset.
That's why he left.

02:48.293 --> 02:49.168
Good.

02:49.752 --> 02:52.130
A tablet? How much is it?

02:52.255 --> 02:54.465
Let's buy him one when he comes back.

02:57.927 --> 02:59.596
Yes, let's do that.

03:03.141 --> 03:05.518
I'LL JUST STAY HERE

03:07.020 --> 03:10.773
But today is Mom's birthday.
She might be too worried to have a party.

03:11.399 --> 03:12.692
Should I go out?

03:13.234 --> 03:18.990
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you!

03:19.115 --> 03:21.868
Happy birthday, dear Mom

03:21.993 --> 03:24.537
Happy birthday to you!

03:25.246 --> 03:26.164
Mom, the candles!

03:29.626 --> 03:32.045
Mom, try this!

03:32.170 --> 03:33.171
-Gotcha!
-You--

03:38.635 --> 03:40.053
-Gotcha.
-Mom!

03:40.178 --> 03:41.554
For you!

03:42.847 --> 03:44.390
What is this?

03:45.225 --> 03:46.559
-A face mask?
-Yeah.

03:46.684 --> 03:50.772
Is this that popular face mask
with an animal drawn on it?

03:50.897 --> 03:53.358
The woman next door
was bragging about hers.

03:53.983 --> 03:56.110
-Not that one.
-Yeah?

03:56.236 --> 03:58.655
Thanks, anyway.

03:59.447 --> 04:01.157
I'm hungry.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.536
Mom, cook sweet and sour pork
for my birthday next year.

04:08.414 --> 04:13.586
Seok loves japchae.
Leave some for him.

04:14.420 --> 04:16.172
I'm hungry. Should I go out there?

04:16.297 --> 04:19.008
He has no place to go.
He will come back tonight.

04:19.467 --> 04:22.303
Right, what the hell am I doing?

04:22.428 --> 04:24.180
I'll go out and eat japchae.

04:24.305 --> 04:26.266
Dad, he won't come back that quickly.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.351
Come back on the same day
and lose face?

04:28.810 --> 04:31.604
I wouldn't call him a man.
He'd just be a clown.

04:32.063 --> 04:34.691
Right!

04:37.485 --> 04:39.988
-Don't be so picky.
-I won't say a word.

04:52.583 --> 04:54.377
It's okay. Hang in there.

04:55.378 --> 04:57.380
It's not the right time to go out.

04:58.006 --> 05:01.843
Hang in there. Take it easy.
I'm going out!

05:16.399 --> 05:18.151
That's it.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.448
A few more steps.

05:41.716 --> 05:42.842
Did you just poop?

06:04.530 --> 06:06.491
Disgusting!

06:06.616 --> 06:08.159
Hon, what are you doing?

06:08.284 --> 06:09.202
She thinks I'm Dad.

06:09.577 --> 06:10.995
I should pretend I'm him.

06:12.580 --> 06:15.041
Yeah, I'm pooping now!

06:15.416 --> 06:16.959
Is he out of his mind?

06:23.299 --> 06:24.509
What are you doing?

06:26.427 --> 06:29.180
Take your pants off. Do you need
to be potty trained all over again?

06:31.432 --> 06:32.433
Oh, the sound!

06:38.106 --> 06:41.609
-Take your pants off.
-What do you mean?

06:42.401 --> 06:43.694
Do you smell poop?

06:43.820 --> 06:45.530
-Do you?
-Take your pants off.

06:45.655 --> 06:48.116
I didn't poop. I swear.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.159
You're out of your mind.

06:51.536 --> 06:54.956
What do you smell?

06:55.081 --> 06:57.250
-You said you pooped.
-You've gone too far!

06:57.375 --> 07:00.503
You always look down on me.

07:01.671 --> 07:04.132
What are you looking at?

07:04.257 --> 07:06.676
Oh, man! It's yummy!

07:08.761 --> 07:11.681
It's your turn to pay.
See you later.

07:13.224 --> 07:16.310
Mom, where's the newspaper?

07:16.436 --> 07:17.812
In the basket next to the air conditioner!

07:20.022 --> 07:22.233
In the basket? Where is it?

07:28.197 --> 07:30.616
Is the air conditioner automatic?

07:43.921 --> 07:45.006
Mom, the newspaper is right here.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.095
That was close.

07:51.220 --> 07:53.764
Strange. I'm sure I heard it.

07:54.265 --> 07:58.227
People should try to age gracefully.

08:00.938 --> 08:02.857
She's losing it.

08:15.620 --> 08:19.999
Let me introduce you to the latest trend,
the healthy low sodium diet!

08:20.124 --> 08:21.709
It's so simple.

08:21.834 --> 08:24.128
Who wants to eat rice? Me!

08:24.253 --> 08:26.214
Who wants chicken? Me!

08:26.339 --> 08:28.424
You just have to eat like this.
Simple, right?

08:38.935 --> 08:41.312
Did you eat this?
After eating so much at dinner?

08:41.437 --> 08:43.481
Didn't I tell you to leave some for Seok?

08:43.606 --> 08:44.774
I didn't eat it.

08:44.899 --> 08:47.652
Then, did Seok eat it?

08:49.862 --> 08:51.864
Why is it so cold in here?

08:54.867 --> 08:56.452
Why are you wasting money?

08:56.577 --> 08:59.664
-Why did you turn on the air conditioner?
-I didn't!

08:59.789 --> 09:01.165
So, your brother turned it on, huh?

09:01.749 --> 09:05.670
It turned itself on.
I'm telling the truth.

09:05.795 --> 09:08.673
Do you want to die?
Do you think money grows on trees?

09:09.215 --> 09:12.134
I told you to save energy, water, and--

09:12.260 --> 09:16.264
-I told you--
-I didn't do it.

09:20.977 --> 09:24.522
What's the matter with her?

09:26.065 --> 09:27.775
Seriously...

09:30.319 --> 09:31.904
What is that? Poop?

09:35.199 --> 09:38.202
Oh, I need to go, too.

09:38.869 --> 09:40.246
Come out right now!

09:43.499 --> 09:46.586
Don't forget to save water.

09:48.754 --> 09:50.256
Come out, hurry!

09:51.966 --> 09:53.634
Jeez...

09:55.386 --> 09:57.638
You disgusting piece of crap!

09:57.763 --> 10:00.266
Don't forget to flush, you moron!

10:00.391 --> 10:01.767
Are you doing this on purpose?

10:03.352 --> 10:07.398
You told me to save water.

10:11.485 --> 10:13.738
Do you think Seok will come home today?

10:13.863 --> 10:17.658
Yeah, I'll just act like I left
and then came back.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.201
You're underestimating him.

10:19.327 --> 10:20.953
He's over 30.

10:21.078 --> 10:24.957
He even left a card before leaving.
He is not coming back after just one day.

10:25.082 --> 10:28.628
-We should be nicer to him.
-How much longer do I need to be in here?

10:29.545 --> 10:33.549
By the way,
what kind of tablet should we buy?

10:33.674 --> 10:35.718
I don't know.
Let's do some research.

10:35.843 --> 10:39.138
Does he really need a tablet?

10:39.263 --> 10:40.431
He said he needs one.

10:40.556 --> 10:45.144
What's so great about it
that he's willing to leave home for it?

11:06.540 --> 11:07.708
-A face mask?
-Yeah.

11:07.833 --> 11:11.712
Is this that popular face mask
with an animal drawn on it?

11:11.837 --> 11:13.589
The woman next door
was bragging about hers.

11:13.714 --> 11:15.299
-Not that one.
-Yeah?

11:29.063 --> 11:31.649
I also gave Mom a birthday present.

12:01.762 --> 12:03.431
How do I talk to the staff?

12:03.556 --> 12:05.433
What's so important
about talking to the staff?

12:11.355 --> 12:12.898
I feel like I'm gonna cry.

12:13.023 --> 12:14.567
The other day...

12:16.986 --> 12:19.530
I don't even know
if Seok is getting enough to eat.

12:44.096 --> 12:45.723
Let's see...

12:50.478 --> 12:51.687
Why are these all open?

12:53.481 --> 12:54.982
Did I open them?

12:55.566 --> 12:58.736
Honey, where is my blue tie?

12:59.987 --> 13:01.447
In the wardrobe, maybe?

13:01.572 --> 13:05.659
-Just go to sleep. Look for it tomorrow.
-Yeah, all right. Let's do that.

13:07.953 --> 13:11.290
This one has a drawing on it!
This is the mask!

13:16.670 --> 13:18.631
THIS IS JUST RIGHT...

13:18.756 --> 13:21.383
Why hasn't he come home yet?

13:22.384 --> 13:25.513
Did he find out the secret?

13:25.638 --> 13:27.640
No way!

13:28.432 --> 13:31.769
If he found out,
he wouldn't be able to accept it.

13:32.311 --> 13:35.856
No, he must've found out
about it on his own.

13:35.981 --> 13:38.776
I mean, he's unusually tall.

13:38.901 --> 13:40.903
Even an idiot would've noticed it.

13:41.028 --> 13:43.239
What are they talking about?

13:43.364 --> 13:45.658
-Are they saying...?
-No.

13:45.783 --> 13:48.786
Seok is my son, no matter what.

13:48.911 --> 13:53.666
We need to take this secret to our graves.

13:58.379 --> 13:59.755
Why are they crying?

14:01.173 --> 14:04.468
No... that's a lie!

14:04.593 --> 14:06.887
That can't be right!

14:07.012 --> 14:11.100
Where is his birth mother?

14:12.518 --> 14:14.770
You know.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.648
The veggie juice lady.

14:24.196 --> 14:26.699
The veggie juice lady.

14:30.286 --> 14:33.330
Honey, where is my blue tie?

14:33.455 --> 14:36.083
In the wardrobe, maybe?
Just go to sleep. Look for it tomorrow.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.794
Yeah, all right. Let's do that.

14:42.047 --> 14:44.049
But I have to leave early tomorrow.

14:45.342 --> 14:47.261
Where could it...?
Could it be over here?

15:02.067 --> 15:03.360
You little...

15:05.988 --> 15:08.741
You moron.

15:11.076 --> 15:15.497
YOU MORON

15:25.257 --> 15:29.011
Oh, Mom! My mom!

15:29.637 --> 15:31.180
Hey!

15:35.309 --> 15:38.646
-Are you all finished?
-Yeah.

15:38.771 --> 15:43.192
-Honey--
-I'll wash my own dish, Mom--

15:46.737 --> 15:49.490
-Give me that.
-Okay.

16:06.298 --> 16:08.717
Veggie juice delivery!

16:09.051 --> 16:10.010
I'll get it.

16:13.555 --> 16:15.474
DAILY VEGGIE JUICE

16:23.273 --> 16:25.109
You look so pale.

16:25.943 --> 16:29.905
Yeah? I'm--

16:30.030 --> 16:31.782
Eat these.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.535
I'll give you these, too.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.662
Make sure you eat them all.

17:06.025 --> 17:06.900
"Mom."

17:10.320 --> 17:11.447
Mom.

17:27.671 --> 17:30.507
YEAR 2066

17:38.390 --> 17:40.142
Let's get back to the interview.

17:42.102 --> 17:44.438
We were talking about your wife, Ae-bong.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.523
My wife?

17:47.900 --> 17:50.778
Everyone is so curious about her.

17:50.903 --> 17:55.657
Yes, you're correct.
Can you tell us your love story?

17:56.116 --> 17:57.576
Well...

17:57.993 --> 18:01.914
Actually, we have
a very special love story.

18:02.039 --> 18:06.335
My heart pounds whenever
I think about the wedding in 2016,

18:06.460 --> 18:09.588
as if today were that day.

18:09.713 --> 18:11.298
I remember everything.

18:12.382 --> 18:14.760
THE 2016 WEDDING RECEPTION

18:16.512 --> 18:20.307
Ae-bong wore her hair in a bob.
She was a cute girl.

18:24.394 --> 18:28.398
-Let's be friends forever.
-Of course.

18:29.608 --> 18:32.319
Let's see each other often
even after the wedding.

18:34.196 --> 18:36.198
Sure, man!

18:36.323 --> 18:37.908
Pick a wine for me.

18:42.246 --> 18:45.499
-You like this one, right?
-I love it!

18:45.624 --> 18:47.209
That's the only wine I drink.

18:47.751 --> 18:49.878
You remembered. Same ol' Seok.

18:50.003 --> 18:52.256
I really shouldn't get drunk today.

18:52.714 --> 18:54.800
I don't know about anyone else,

18:54.925 --> 18:57.970
but, to me, Ae-bong looked
the most beautiful.

18:58.345 --> 19:00.013
REPLY 2016

19:00.139 --> 19:01.265
He won the first game.

19:01.390 --> 19:04.935
REPLY 2016

REPLY 2016
WHO IS AE-BONG?

19:12.317 --> 19:15.195
Seok, did you say hello to our classmates?

19:16.029 --> 19:18.240
Great to see you all!

19:18.365 --> 19:19.491
You guys didn't change a bit!

19:20.033 --> 19:21.201
Congratulations on your wedding!

19:21.326 --> 19:22.452
Seok, it's been a long time!

19:22.578 --> 19:25.038
-Hope you have a happy marriage!
-Yeah, see you next time.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.083
-Wait.
-Why?

19:28.208 --> 19:30.752
-A hair.
-Oh, honey!

19:30.878 --> 19:33.255
Who are you?
Are you hitting on my girlfriend?

19:33.463 --> 19:36.216
Sook, didn't I tell you
not to wear a skirt?

19:36.550 --> 19:39.303
You're making all the men crazy about you!
That's driving me crazy!

19:39.428 --> 19:42.139
-No, there was a hair--
-Don't lose any more hair.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.933
Not even one strand of hair. Got it?

19:46.226 --> 19:49.396
How dare you raise your voice to me!

19:49.521 --> 19:51.398
I tried to be nice,
but I can't take this anymore.

19:51.523 --> 19:53.192
You interrupted me and my friends.

19:53.901 --> 19:55.986
Come on, let's go. How embarrassing.

19:56.111 --> 19:57.196
Sorry, honey!

19:57.321 --> 19:58.155
-Honey!
-Let's go!

19:58.280 --> 19:59.239
Honey!

19:59.698 --> 20:01.700
They must really be in love.

20:01.825 --> 20:04.036
Let's resume the party now.

20:04.995 --> 20:06.413
Come up here, bride and groom.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.333
Well...

20:12.336 --> 20:13.545
My life is over.

20:14.087 --> 20:15.797
Stop saying that.

20:15.923 --> 20:18.383
Honey, come on.

20:18.508 --> 20:22.763
My life is definitely over.

20:30.854 --> 20:32.189
Be happy!

20:32.314 --> 20:36.735
My best friends, Nam-cheol and Yun-ji,
got married that day.

20:36.860 --> 20:39.863
It was an unforgettable day because...

20:39.988 --> 20:41.240
Seok.

20:41.365 --> 20:45.869
I have a blind date. Should I go?

20:48.914 --> 20:49.998
Don't go.

20:51.625 --> 20:54.836
No more blind dates.

20:59.549 --> 21:02.928
-So, you love me--
-No, I just pity that poor guy.

21:11.186 --> 21:12.479
Being good-looking isn't everything!

21:13.313 --> 21:15.274
Being handsome isn't everything!

21:22.781 --> 21:26.535
That day, I saw Ae-bong
for the first time in a long time.

21:26.660 --> 21:27.828
It was like destiny.

21:29.538 --> 21:30.622
Why isn't she here yet?

21:30.747 --> 21:32.499
The reception is almost over.

21:45.679 --> 21:48.223
-Sorry I'm late.
-Everyone was waiting for you.

21:48.348 --> 21:52.352
Sorry, but I'm so glad you didn't leave.

21:52.477 --> 21:55.522
-Oh, it's hot. I'm thirsty.
-Allow me.

21:59.776 --> 22:03.155
It's okay. I can fill up my own glass.

22:03.280 --> 22:05.282
Let me fill up your glass.

22:10.245 --> 22:12.789
Let's hang out after I get
back from my honeymoon.

22:12.914 --> 22:16.710
I'm envious of them.
When will I get married?

22:16.835 --> 22:20.797
Seok, do you think
you're not ready for marriage?

22:20.922 --> 22:23.717
-Yeah.
-I'm ready, though.

22:25.218 --> 22:26.094
What?

22:31.058 --> 22:33.226
-Good job!
-You, too!

22:38.190 --> 22:39.775
Hey, what are you thinking about?

22:39.900 --> 22:43.403
No, I want to get married,

22:43.528 --> 22:47.574
but there's financial uncertainty
being a webtoon artist,

22:47.699 --> 22:49.367
and I haven't been able to save much.

22:49.493 --> 22:52.370
That's okay. That's why I'm here.

22:55.665 --> 22:56.917
HEALTH INSURANCE POLICY

22:57.042 --> 22:58.877
This is a new one.

22:59.002 --> 23:00.587
This is private health insurance
for the elderly.

23:00.712 --> 23:03.715
You will probably live alone,
so you need a plan for your later years.

23:03.840 --> 23:07.177
When you're sick and alone,
how will you pay for your hospital bill?

23:07.511 --> 23:10.097
So, I brought this for you.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.432
That's why you're here.
I wish you'd just get lost.

23:12.557 --> 23:15.060
When you die,
we'll cover the cost of the funeral.

23:15.185 --> 23:16.853
Do you think you're not going to die?

23:18.105 --> 23:22.192
Sorry, but I have no money.

23:22.317 --> 23:23.652
I'll get it when I have money.

23:25.529 --> 23:27.614
Oh, okay.

23:28.323 --> 23:31.493
You should've said that earlier.
Son of a...

23:34.746 --> 23:35.622
Gyun-seong!

23:36.832 --> 23:38.208
Oh, my gosh!

23:45.507 --> 23:49.219
I was out of my mind. Idiot.

23:51.930 --> 23:53.515
Oh, no! I'm sorry!

23:53.640 --> 23:55.600
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

23:59.062 --> 24:01.022
Oh, Seok?

24:01.148 --> 24:03.150
You're Seok Cho
from Saebit High School, right?

24:03.942 --> 24:05.318
Ae-bong!

24:05.443 --> 24:08.822
TO BE CONTINUED IN 60 SECONDS

24:30.844 --> 24:34.222
Everyone was moving! What is this?

24:34.347 --> 24:35.974
I could've died!

24:36.099 --> 24:38.476
Shall I go again?

24:39.728 --> 24:41.188
And action.

24:42.814 --> 24:44.191
Ae-bong!

24:57.495 --> 24:58.538
Oh, my gosh.

24:58.663 --> 25:01.333
Hey, you look awful.

25:01.458 --> 25:03.210
I must've hit your face.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.837
No, you didn't.

25:05.962 --> 25:08.548
What are you saying?
How come you look so awful?

25:08.673 --> 25:10.467
You should go see a doctor.

25:14.304 --> 25:18.308
Ae-bong looked so beautiful
with her bob and her cute skirt.

25:18.433 --> 25:21.645
In 2016, my heart was racing so fast.

25:21.770 --> 25:25.732
Was it because of heartworms,
or because of her?

25:25.857 --> 25:28.526
I wanted to know.

25:29.110 --> 25:30.153
I--

25:31.446 --> 25:32.697
You want to know, right?

25:34.157 --> 25:35.408
Yeah. No.

25:35.533 --> 25:38.870
Sorry! Recently, guys have been trying
to kiss me saying that they want to know.

25:39.246 --> 25:40.205
I'm really sorry.

25:40.330 --> 25:42.916
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

25:43.041 --> 25:46.169
Anyway, it's good to see you!
It's been so long! How have you been?

25:46.294 --> 25:47.921
You look great!

25:48.046 --> 25:50.465
-You're so tall.
-That day, I met my first love again.

25:50.590 --> 25:53.468
It was like destiny.

25:55.887 --> 26:00.684
And Ae-bong became
my first and last love.

26:19.494 --> 26:24.457
IF I HAD KNOWN THEN
WHAT I KNOW NOW...

26:29.129 --> 26:31.298
Great! Let's get started.

26:32.007 --> 26:33.717
You, with the bob.

26:33.842 --> 26:37.012
Move one step to my right.

26:38.847 --> 26:40.598
Oh, no.

26:40.724 --> 26:42.142
You, with the bob.

26:42.267 --> 26:45.395
One step down, please.

26:49.691 --> 26:51.401
Back there, you, with the bob.

26:51.526 --> 26:53.320
Would you switch with the one
in front of you?

27:01.411 --> 27:03.413
Oh, no.

27:03.872 --> 27:06.124
Why did you move?

27:06.374 --> 27:09.586
Why does everyone have bobs?
It's so confusing!

27:16.843 --> 27:18.970
Last time!

27:19.095 --> 27:23.058
The ladies with bobs in the middle,
please switch spots.

27:32.484 --> 27:33.318
I'll just take it!
