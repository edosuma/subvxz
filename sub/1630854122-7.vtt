00:53.488 --> 00:55.229
What?

00:55.316 --> 00:58.928
Just you.

00:59.015 --> 01:03.063
You gonna keep staring
or zip me up?

01:03.150 --> 01:04.586
Why so fancy?

01:04.673 --> 01:07.980
- Church.
- Oh, OK.

01:08.068 --> 01:12.202
I didn't even think about that
or know it was Sunday.

01:12.289 --> 01:14.204
My mom told me I needed
to get back into the spirit.

01:14.291 --> 01:15.249
Oh.

01:15.336 --> 01:16.946
My parents like
to guilt-trip me

01:17.033 --> 01:20.863
for still being single
and owning a bar.

01:20.950 --> 01:22.473
Do yours?

01:22.560 --> 01:23.866
It's just me
and my sister now.

01:23.953 --> 01:25.868
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:25.955 --> 01:27.696
I didn't mean
to make you feel uncomfortable.

01:27.783 --> 01:29.872
No, no, it's OK.
It's not...

01:29.959 --> 01:31.787
It's a big can of worms.

01:31.874 --> 01:32.831
It's something
we shouldn't talk about

01:32.918 --> 01:35.530
before you go to church.

01:35.617 --> 01:37.271
I want
to know more about you.

01:37.358 --> 01:39.055
Baby steps.

01:39.142 --> 01:41.101
You might hear some things come
out of my mouth about my dad

01:41.188 --> 01:43.146
that aren't exactly
in the spirit.

01:43.233 --> 01:45.453
And I gotta get to work.

01:45.540 --> 01:46.584
No rest for you.

01:46.671 --> 01:48.543
Not in the Bureau.

01:48.630 --> 01:50.284
You want to come over later?

01:50.371 --> 01:52.721
I want to hear more
about your sister.

01:58.988 --> 02:00.990
Mm, you should
probably head out

02:01.077 --> 02:03.035
before this turns
into Saturday night

02:03.123 --> 02:04.689
instead of Sunday morning.

02:20.705 --> 02:22.925
This reminds me of Lanzarote.

02:23.012 --> 02:25.275
Oh, no.

02:25.362 --> 02:26.972
I believe you said,
"I'll be right back."

02:27.059 --> 02:29.149
It couldn't be helped.

02:29.236 --> 02:31.020
And you had the boat to
yourself the whole afternoon.

02:31.107 --> 02:32.543
But I wanted to be with you.

02:32.630 --> 02:34.110
I know you did, babe.

02:36.417 --> 02:40.377
We need some alone time,
just me and you.

02:40.464 --> 02:41.987
You want me
to send Sean away?

02:42.074 --> 02:43.859
Do we need constant security?

02:43.946 --> 02:47.515
Darling, I am here,
alone with you,

02:47.602 --> 02:50.866
one-on-one right here,
right now,

02:50.953 --> 02:52.781
because I love you.

02:52.868 --> 02:54.739
And if your phone rings?

02:54.826 --> 02:56.915
I won't answer it.

02:57.002 --> 02:58.656
I swear on a stack of bibles.

03:15.847 --> 03:18.023
We should get married
at a church like this.

03:18.110 --> 03:20.243
- It's perfect.
- Yeah.

03:20.330 --> 03:22.245
Like you.

03:22.332 --> 03:25.814
And this is the perfect moment.

03:27.685 --> 03:31.602
Tiyanna Gladys Lynelle.

03:38.435 --> 03:39.784
- Oh, my God!
- Hey! Hey!

03:39.871 --> 03:41.046
What are you do--

03:41.133 --> 03:42.439
Don't shoot!

03:44.354 --> 03:46.313
Brent, help me!
No! No!

03:48.924 --> 03:49.838
- Brent, help!
- Put her in there!

03:49.925 --> 03:51.318
Put her in there!
- No! No!

04:01.502 --> 04:03.591
Come on!
Come on! Come on!

04:21.565 --> 04:23.045
Morning.

04:23.132 --> 04:25.308
You left Zizi's pub
awfully early last night.

04:25.395 --> 04:27.745
And Maya left
around the same time too.

04:27.832 --> 04:30.095
Weird.
- It's a mystery.

04:30.182 --> 04:32.228
Wow, you two
are super sleuths.

04:32.315 --> 04:35.100
You know, you should join
the FBI, solve cases together.

04:35.187 --> 04:36.667
Oh, that's a fantastic idea.

04:36.754 --> 04:38.321
Vo, wanna be my partner?
- I would love that.

04:40.541 --> 04:43.326
So things are getting serious?

04:43.413 --> 04:45.197
I mean,
I'm not seeing anyone else.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.677
Oh, you're exclusive?

04:46.764 --> 04:49.158
We're just two grown adults
having fun.

04:49.245 --> 04:51.421
One of whom
is an FBI agent.

04:51.508 --> 04:54.163
And sooner or later, that world
butts up with the other,

04:54.250 --> 04:57.775
or so I was told by Forrester pointedly.

04:57.862 --> 05:00.517
OK, no rest for the weary.

05:00.604 --> 05:02.214
We just caught a case.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.347
Catalonia police in Barcelona

05:04.434 --> 05:06.044
reported a kidnapping
this morning

05:06.131 --> 05:08.046
of two American adults:

05:08.133 --> 05:10.440
Tiyanna Lynelle
and Sean Doxon.

05:10.527 --> 05:12.834
Now apparently Tiyanna has been
living in Spain for a year,

05:12.921 --> 05:15.053
works for an American-based
consulting firm.

05:15.140 --> 05:17.186
Sean Doxon
is a bodyguard

05:17.273 --> 05:20.407
working for Tiyanna's
boyfriend, Brent Remis.

05:20.494 --> 05:23.671
Doxon's work history lists
several private security jobs

05:23.758 --> 05:25.542
at conventions and clubs
in New York City.

05:25.629 --> 05:27.022
- Military training?
- No.

05:27.109 --> 05:28.328
Any record?

05:28.415 --> 05:29.981
Two battery charges,
both dismissed.

05:30.068 --> 05:32.114
That's not uncommon
for a security guard.

05:32.201 --> 05:33.681
The boyfriend,
Brent Remis,

05:33.768 --> 05:35.073
why does he need
private security?

05:35.160 --> 05:38.773
He owns an American company

05:38.860 --> 05:40.775
called Prime Flux Construction

05:40.862 --> 05:43.038
that does business with
several international clients

05:43.125 --> 05:45.954
all over Western Europe,
according to his website.

05:46.041 --> 05:48.565
Girlfriend's kidnapped,
bodyguard's kidnapped.

05:48.652 --> 05:50.219
He's left untouched?

05:50.306 --> 05:51.786
Witnesses say
it was a chaotic scene.

05:51.873 --> 05:52.830
Not sure who was targeted.

05:52.917 --> 05:54.005
Where's Remis now?

05:54.092 --> 05:55.442
Saint Domines Hospital.

05:55.529 --> 05:57.400
Concussion.
- So not untouched.

05:57.487 --> 05:59.228
Did the kidnappers
turn over ransom demands?

05:59.315 --> 06:00.751
Nothing yet.
Catalonia Police

06:00.838 --> 06:03.101
have requested our presence
in Barcelona.

06:03.188 --> 06:05.539
Smitty is already headed there
to help facilitate.

06:10.718 --> 06:12.241
You coming?

06:12.328 --> 06:14.199
I got a call from our legat
in Budapest.

06:14.286 --> 06:15.853
Dandridge.
- Yeah?

06:15.940 --> 06:17.202
I've been summoned.

06:17.289 --> 06:19.161
- For what?
- I'm not sure.

06:19.248 --> 06:21.381
But I'm gonna need you
to cover this case without me.

06:21.468 --> 06:23.165
Copy.

06:23.252 --> 06:24.514
You take care of him.

06:24.601 --> 06:27.691
Oh, he will.

06:27.778 --> 06:29.867
Thank you
for coming so quickly.

06:29.954 --> 06:32.696
I'm Inspector Olivia Montoya
with the CNP here in Barcelona.

06:32.783 --> 06:34.611
Thanks for bringing us in, Inspector.

06:34.698 --> 06:36.526
We're here to assist
your investigation in any way.

06:36.613 --> 06:38.354
Officer Garretson
with Europol

06:38.441 --> 06:40.269
is setting up space
for you to work.

06:40.356 --> 06:43.838
Great. We work closely
with FO Garretson.

06:43.925 --> 06:46.971
So far, we have no motive,
no ransom requests,

06:47.058 --> 06:49.626
no political or terrorist group
claiming responsibility.

06:49.713 --> 06:51.454
Were they targeted
because they're Americans?

06:51.541 --> 06:53.500
Because of Brent Remis'
construction business?

06:53.587 --> 06:55.893
We're in the dark.
- Could have been personal.

06:55.980 --> 06:59.114
When I see triangles like this,
my mind goes to dark places.

07:05.512 --> 07:06.513
Brent Remis.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.340
I'm Special Agent
Jamie Kellett.

07:08.428 --> 07:11.256
This is Special Agent
Andre Raines with the FBI.

07:11.343 --> 07:13.607
OK. Well, thank God.
Is there any news on Tiyanna?

07:13.694 --> 07:15.347
No one's telling me anything.
- Not yet.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.828
Aren't the first 48 hours
the most important?

07:17.915 --> 07:20.135
That's what true crime books
say, the first 48 hours...

07:20.222 --> 07:21.397
I can assure you,
we are working

07:21.484 --> 07:22.703
with the Catalonia Police,

07:22.790 --> 07:24.444
and they are doing
everything they can.

07:24.531 --> 07:26.707
Why don't you take me
through what happened?

07:26.794 --> 07:28.273
I told them.

07:28.360 --> 07:30.275
Tell us.

07:31.929 --> 07:34.105
This van roars up out
of nowhere,

07:34.192 --> 07:36.238
and two thugs jump out.

07:36.325 --> 07:38.719
They grabbed me first,
and my bodyguard, Sean--

07:38.806 --> 07:40.764
Sean Doxon--
steps in.

07:40.851 --> 07:43.201
He tried--
he fought with them,

07:43.288 --> 07:45.334
but these guys
are seriously trained.

07:45.421 --> 07:47.641
In the confusion,
I guess...

07:47.728 --> 07:50.034
I kind of got away.

07:50.121 --> 07:51.949
I was running for help.

07:52.036 --> 07:53.647
I thought Tiyanna
was behind me.

07:53.734 --> 07:55.257
And then I get knocked
to the ground.

07:55.344 --> 07:56.650
And by the time I get up,

07:56.737 --> 07:58.695
that van is hauling ass out
of there.

07:58.782 --> 08:00.131
No sign of Tiyanna or Sean,

08:00.218 --> 08:01.916
their phones left smashed
on the pavement.

08:02.003 --> 08:04.658
I...

08:04.745 --> 08:06.181
I've never seen anything
like this.

08:06.268 --> 08:07.487
Did you get a look
at the kidnappers?

08:07.574 --> 08:08.792
They wore masks.

08:08.879 --> 08:14.189
Tattoos, jewelry
like necklaces, watches?

08:14.276 --> 08:17.366
Maybe the kidnappers
spoke Spanish.

08:17.453 --> 08:20.500
I'm sorry.
It all happened so fast.

08:20.587 --> 08:23.546
I'm not even sure what I saw.

08:23.633 --> 08:25.461
Tell us
how you and Tiyanna met.

08:25.548 --> 08:29.552
Yeah, a dating app
four months ago.

08:29.639 --> 08:32.033
I swiped right.

08:32.120 --> 08:33.513
We just met,
and there were sparks.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.036
It may sound stupid,
but that's what happened.

08:35.123 --> 08:36.516
She's, um...

08:39.780 --> 08:41.129
We fell in love.

08:45.263 --> 08:47.091
Does she have any enemies?

08:47.178 --> 08:50.399
An old boyfriend?
Someone else who swiped right?

08:50.486 --> 08:52.401
No, nothing like that.

08:52.488 --> 08:55.447
Tiyanna, she's a good soul.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.406
Why did you have security?

08:57.493 --> 08:59.843
I own a construction business
in Rhode Island.

08:59.930 --> 09:02.367
Any ties to organized crime?

09:02.454 --> 09:04.065
Not me.
No way.

09:04.152 --> 09:05.153
Is that
what somebody is saying?

09:05.240 --> 09:07.416
Keep going.

09:07.503 --> 09:09.200
Any construction business
in the northeast

09:09.287 --> 09:11.376
is gonna have problems,

09:11.463 --> 09:13.291
people looking to beat you out
of a contract

09:13.378 --> 09:16.164
by any means necessary,
if you know what I'm saying.

09:16.251 --> 09:17.644
I'm a solid businessman.

09:17.731 --> 09:21.169
I do good work on time
and on budget.

09:21.256 --> 09:24.999
For that, I have
received threats from...

09:25.086 --> 09:26.261
competitors.

09:26.348 --> 09:28.437
That's why I hired Sean.

09:28.524 --> 09:29.960
Where did you find him?

09:30.047 --> 09:32.876
He was working the door
at a club on Fifth Avenue.

09:32.963 --> 09:35.531
We hit it off.
He pitched his services to me.

09:35.618 --> 09:37.794
He's a good man, solid.

09:37.881 --> 09:40.188
I have nothing but great things
to say about him.

09:41.668 --> 09:43.452
One second,
we're watching

09:43.539 --> 09:46.455
this wedding party
exit a cathedral.

09:46.542 --> 09:51.503
It's the most beautiful,
romantic setting.

09:51.591 --> 09:54.071
I was getting down
on one knee when...

09:54.158 --> 09:56.378
<i>Por favor, vallase.
Es necesita descansa.</i>

09:56.465 --> 09:57.858
<i>Perdóna.</i>

09:57.945 --> 09:58.815
We'll be in touch.

10:01.644 --> 10:03.124
He said
there was a wedding party.

10:03.211 --> 10:04.734
Uh-huh.

10:04.821 --> 10:06.649
Then there was most likely
someone who filmed it.

10:08.999 --> 10:10.871
It wasn't difficult
to track down the newlyweds.

10:10.958 --> 10:12.133
As Kellett guessed,

10:12.220 --> 10:14.091
their cousin was filming
the procession

10:14.178 --> 10:17.138
and captured some
of the kidnapping.

10:27.496 --> 10:29.541
What a prince, right?

10:29.629 --> 10:31.065
We have a word for
that kind of man in the U.K.

10:31.152 --> 10:32.632
Coward?

10:32.719 --> 10:34.198
Wanker.

10:44.382 --> 10:46.558
Hey, pause that.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.431
The way the sun
catches the van here,

10:49.518 --> 10:51.999
that look like
there are words painted over?

10:54.392 --> 10:57.221
It says it's a flower shop
on Carrer del Corsega.

10:57.308 --> 10:58.919
I know where it is.
<i>Parc de Carles.</i>

10:59.006 --> 11:00.572
It's a few minutes from here.
- Vo, go with her.

11:03.793 --> 11:05.752
Brent knew Tiyanna
for only four months

11:05.839 --> 11:07.971
and he already had a ring?
- It could happen.

11:08.058 --> 11:10.495
Does that look like
a guy in love to you?

11:10.582 --> 11:13.194
I looked at Tiyanna's
company, Valotta Consulting.

11:13.281 --> 11:15.805
No red flags.
Legitimate firm

11:15.892 --> 11:17.894
with two dozen years
of tax returns to back it up.

11:17.981 --> 11:19.374
I also dug
into Brent's company,

11:19.461 --> 11:21.985
Prime Flux Construction.

11:22.072 --> 11:23.944
The website we saw earlier,

11:24.031 --> 11:26.381
there are misspellings
on the about page.

11:26.468 --> 11:29.297
The web design looks like
it was made in 1997.

11:29.384 --> 11:30.820
And you see that background?

11:30.907 --> 11:32.953
That high-rise is
in San Francisco,

11:33.040 --> 11:34.041
not Rhode Island.

11:34.128 --> 11:35.259
The shadows don't even match.

11:35.346 --> 11:36.304
Photoshopped.

11:36.391 --> 11:38.045
The whole thing
is amateur hour.

11:38.132 --> 11:39.481
Not to mention,
this ribbon cutting

11:39.568 --> 11:40.700
can be viewed as fraud.

11:40.787 --> 11:42.440
And he's doing business
internationally?

11:42.527 --> 11:43.920
That seem odd to you guys?

11:44.007 --> 11:46.706
It did to me,
which got me to look further.

11:46.793 --> 11:48.577
Brent's business
isn't registered

11:48.664 --> 11:50.361
on the Secretary of State's
website.

11:50.448 --> 11:53.190
And Prime Flux Construction
reported zero earnings

11:53.277 --> 11:55.192
in the last two years.

11:55.279 --> 11:57.499
It's a fake company.

11:57.586 --> 11:59.109
Was the kidnapping fake
as well?

11:59.196 --> 12:01.198
Hey, Inspector Montoya
just got a call

12:01.285 --> 12:02.983
from the hotel where Brent
and Tiyanna were staying.

12:03.070 --> 12:05.333
A woman was trying to break
into his hotel room.

12:16.997 --> 12:18.650
Brent.
He owes me money.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.478
I'm sorry.
Who are you to Brent?

12:20.565 --> 12:21.566
His girlfriend.

12:21.653 --> 12:23.177
Who the hell are you?

12:23.264 --> 12:24.569
You're his girlfriend?

12:24.656 --> 12:26.441
That's right.

12:26.528 --> 12:28.182
I didn't break any laws.

12:28.269 --> 12:29.923
Brent borrowed 94,000 euro
from me

12:30.010 --> 12:31.533
and stopped returning my calls.

12:31.620 --> 12:32.708
I'm here to collect.

12:32.795 --> 12:33.927
That's a lot of money.

12:34.014 --> 12:35.276
He was having
financial trouble,

12:35.363 --> 12:36.756
and he promised he'd return it.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.758
How did you know
he was staying here?

12:38.845 --> 12:39.541
I tracked him down.

12:39.628 --> 12:42.413
How?

12:42.500 --> 12:44.372
Other women have been through
the same thing with him.

12:44.459 --> 12:47.767
But Brent Johnson's not
getting away with it anymore.

12:47.854 --> 12:49.290
You mean Brent Remis.

12:49.377 --> 12:50.857
I mean Brent Johnson.

12:55.513 --> 12:56.558
Him?

12:58.342 --> 12:59.300
Yes.

13:01.911 --> 13:04.087
Thank you for your time.

13:08.309 --> 13:11.225
Hey, I ran the name
"Brent Remis" again.

13:11.312 --> 13:15.185
Turns out he died 15 years ago
when he was two.

13:15.272 --> 13:16.839
OK.

13:16.926 --> 13:18.188
I collected his prints
from his hotel room

13:18.275 --> 13:19.799
and sent them to 26 Fed.

13:19.886 --> 13:21.670
They set off alarm bells.

13:21.757 --> 13:23.672
The prints belong to a fugitive
who has several charges

13:23.759 --> 13:25.413
across the eastern seaboard.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.154
Our man Brent's
been victimizing

13:27.241 --> 13:28.938
and defrauding women for years.

13:29.025 --> 13:31.071
How did this
not pop up before?

13:31.158 --> 13:33.073
Brent Remis
is his newest alias,

13:33.160 --> 13:35.771
along with Rick Collette
from Minnesota,

13:35.858 --> 13:37.860
Brent Johnson
from Redwood, Oregon,

13:37.947 --> 13:41.081
François Oakfield
from New Orleans,

13:41.168 --> 13:42.909
and Joseph Donnelly
from Delaware.

13:42.996 --> 13:46.434
Brent Remis' real name
is Gerald Frederickson.

13:46.521 --> 13:49.176
Who the hell is this guy?

13:49.263 --> 13:50.438
Gerald Frederickson
was charged

13:50.525 --> 13:53.528
by the state of New York
for fraud, theft, and forgery.

13:53.615 --> 13:55.486
After arrest, he posted bail
and went into the wind.

13:55.573 --> 13:57.445
We've had a UFAP warrant
out for him since.

13:57.532 --> 13:59.403
- When?
- Two years ago.

13:59.490 --> 14:01.884
- New continent for a new con.
- Exactly.

14:01.971 --> 14:04.582
There's even a blog
for women who were his victims.

14:04.669 --> 14:06.976
His MO is to charm
the lonely hearts club,

14:07.063 --> 14:09.109
act as if he's a rich,
successful businessman

14:09.196 --> 14:11.372
who happens to have
some bad guys leaning on him.

14:11.459 --> 14:13.504
He needs a few bucks
to get out of it

14:13.591 --> 14:15.419
and disappears when
the money's in his account.

14:15.506 --> 14:17.595
He has several women
strung along at the same time,

14:17.682 --> 14:19.902
using Jane
to pay for his lifestyle

14:19.989 --> 14:23.340
to charm Jenna,
and on and on ad infinitum.

14:23.427 --> 14:26.082
This is the blog the woman
at his hotel was talking about.

14:26.169 --> 14:28.128
If only there was one
for my ex back in Manchester

14:28.215 --> 14:29.651
before I started dating him.

14:29.738 --> 14:31.305
The emotional toll
that would have saved me.

14:31.392 --> 14:33.524
In the last two years,
Gerald's managed

14:33.611 --> 14:36.397
to dupe over a dozen women
out of 2 million euros,

14:36.484 --> 14:38.399
taking small amounts of money
from each one.

14:38.486 --> 14:39.748
So Tiyanna has money?

14:39.835 --> 14:41.968
She has a nice salary,
but she's not rich.

14:42.055 --> 14:44.971
Her family though, her parents
got a nice nest egg.

14:45.058 --> 14:47.625
A couple of houses in the
northeast, a condo in Mexico,

14:47.712 --> 14:49.366
a couple of million
in the market.

14:49.453 --> 14:50.759
But I've checked
Tiyanna's accounts,

14:50.846 --> 14:52.674
and there are
no suspicious withdrawals.

14:52.761 --> 14:55.503
So why kidnap Tiyanna and
not stick to the same old plan?

14:55.590 --> 14:57.157
Maybe he's aware
of the blog

14:57.244 --> 14:58.680
and this kidnapping
is a new con.

14:58.767 --> 15:00.203
He scares her,

15:00.290 --> 15:01.944
Then she calls Mom and Dad
to cough up the cash.

15:02.031 --> 15:04.251
Setting himself up
for a bigger payday.

15:09.647 --> 15:12.563
Nobody's telling me
what's going on here, hmm?

15:12.650 --> 15:15.827
Why I'm sitting in a small room
with a two-way mirror?

15:15.915 --> 15:17.003
Did you find Tiyanna?

15:19.657 --> 15:21.268
What is going on here?
This is crazy.

15:21.355 --> 15:24.010
What, I'm a suspect now?

15:24.097 --> 15:25.098
Why would you use that word?

15:25.185 --> 15:27.187
I didn't.

15:27.274 --> 15:29.102
You guys are making me.

15:31.060 --> 15:32.540
You were saying?

15:37.110 --> 15:39.329
Your name is not Brent Remis,

15:39.416 --> 15:42.158
nor Brent Johnson,
for that matter.

15:42.245 --> 15:44.204
It's really
Gerald Frederickson.

15:44.291 --> 15:45.857
I can explain.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.556
You can explain how
you skipped trial in New York?

15:48.643 --> 15:50.253
How you made an unlawful flight
to Europe?

15:50.340 --> 15:52.168
How you kept your grift going

15:52.255 --> 15:53.691
on a whole new batch
of victims?

15:53.778 --> 15:56.303
Good, 'cause I'm all ears.
- You have it wrong.

15:56.390 --> 15:57.739
The reason
Tiyanna hasn't been found

15:57.826 --> 16:00.307
is because the con man
sitting across from us

16:00.394 --> 16:01.569
isn't giving us
a straight story.

16:01.656 --> 16:03.136
I am telling you,
I didn't kidnap her!

16:07.792 --> 16:10.404
Look,
if you know who I am,

16:10.491 --> 16:13.320
you know this isn't something
I would do.

16:13.407 --> 16:15.496
Yes, I date a lot of women.

16:15.583 --> 16:17.628
- Date?
- That's right.

16:17.715 --> 16:20.109
And yes,
they gave me money.

16:20.196 --> 16:21.763
It was all consensual.

16:21.850 --> 16:24.418
But--

16:24.505 --> 16:26.768
But with Tiyanna,
it was different.

16:26.855 --> 16:28.552
Different meaning
it was time to switch tactics?

16:28.639 --> 16:29.640
No, that's not
what I'm saying.

16:29.727 --> 16:31.860
These women were on to you.

16:31.947 --> 16:35.385
The way you were conning them
caught up with you in the U.S.

16:35.472 --> 16:36.604
Started to catch up
with you here,

16:36.691 --> 16:38.519
so it was different
with Tiyanna.

16:38.606 --> 16:40.695
Your words.

16:40.782 --> 16:42.044
Call Sean Doxon.

16:42.131 --> 16:45.395
Tell him the kidnapping is off.

16:45.482 --> 16:46.831
We are on to both of you,

16:46.918 --> 16:48.920
and this particular grift
of yours is finished.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.271
I didn't do this.

16:51.358 --> 16:52.837
I don't know where Sean is.

16:52.924 --> 16:54.056
I don't know where Tiyanna--

16:58.147 --> 17:01.759
<i>Brent, baby,</i>

17:01.846 --> 17:03.196
<i>the kidnappers,</i>

17:03.283 --> 17:06.982
<i>they want 170,000 euros</i>

17:07.069 --> 17:08.244
<i>in the next 24 hours.</i>

17:11.334 --> 17:13.075
<i>You do what they say,</i>

17:13.162 --> 17:15.643
<i>and they'll let me go.</i>

17:15.730 --> 17:18.167
<i>They'll send instructions.</i>

17:18.254 --> 17:19.908
<i>Please,</i>

17:19.995 --> 17:23.651
<i>do what they say.</i>

17:26.741 --> 17:29.657
<i>I am so scared.</i>

17:29.744 --> 17:32.312
You see?
I am not behind this.

17:32.399 --> 17:33.530
They want me
to give them money.

17:33.617 --> 17:35.358
How does that video
exonerate your bodyguard?

17:35.445 --> 17:38.013
Sean is not--
he wouldn't do this.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.145
You're pulling his strings.

17:39.232 --> 17:41.060
No, there's no way.

17:41.147 --> 17:44.628
- You're a proven liar.
- I am not lying.

17:48.371 --> 17:50.417
He's a con man,
through and through.

17:50.504 --> 17:52.375
Best I've seen.
- What's his angle?

17:52.462 --> 17:54.421
Confuse,
obfuscate, manipulate.

17:54.508 --> 17:55.770
Keep the mark's head spinning.

17:55.857 --> 17:58.686
Well, who's the mark here?
Tiyanna? Us?

17:58.773 --> 18:00.427
I mean, all I know is
when those photos went up,

18:00.514 --> 18:01.906
smooth talker went away.

18:01.993 --> 18:03.430
But when the video
of Tiyanna played,

18:03.517 --> 18:05.432
his emotions seemed genuine.

18:05.519 --> 18:06.737
That's what he wants you
to think.

18:06.824 --> 18:08.130
He's a swindler.

18:08.217 --> 18:11.438
Agents, we found the van.

18:15.398 --> 18:18.793
A local resident saw someone
pull up, park it, and run off.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.882
She didn't get a clear view
of who left it here.

18:20.969 --> 18:22.840
Andres.

18:55.656 --> 18:58.006
Our forensics team
tore the van apart.

18:58.093 --> 18:59.486
Only blood was
from Tiyanna and Doxon.

18:59.573 --> 19:02.228
No additional fingerprints,
hair, fiber, DNA,

19:02.315 --> 19:03.968
anything that could lead
to an ID.

19:04.055 --> 19:05.622
We ran the VIN on the van,

19:05.709 --> 19:07.494
and it did come back
to the flower shop.

19:07.581 --> 19:09.191
But the vehicle
was reported stolen

19:09.278 --> 19:10.932
only two days
before the kidnapping.

19:11.019 --> 19:14.631
So we have one dead American,
one still missing,

19:14.718 --> 19:17.068
and nothing to connect
Gerald Frederickson,

19:17.156 --> 19:19.375
AKA Brent Remis,
to the crime.

19:19.462 --> 19:21.116
Why would he kill
his bodyguard?

19:21.203 --> 19:22.422
None of this makes sense.

19:22.509 --> 19:23.553
There is the blog.

19:23.640 --> 19:24.902
Scorned women trying

19:24.989 --> 19:26.121
to get back
at their manipulator.

19:26.208 --> 19:27.862
But the lack of DNA
in the van,

19:27.949 --> 19:29.646
execution-style shooting,

19:29.733 --> 19:31.953
I mean, does this seem
like a jilted lover

19:32.040 --> 19:32.693
or a professional hit?

19:40.483 --> 19:42.616
We've got another video
sent from an anonymous number.

19:42.703 --> 19:43.704
Play it.

20:02.853 --> 20:04.986
<i>Brent,</i>

20:05.073 --> 20:07.945
<i>they want you
to bring them 170,000 Euros.</i>

20:08.032 --> 20:10.557
<i>3:00 p.m.</i>

20:10.644 --> 20:13.299
<i>The location will be sent
in two hours.</i>

20:13.386 --> 20:15.866
<i>They're gonna kill me next.</i>

20:17.912 --> 20:19.783
<i>I did what you said.</i>

20:19.870 --> 20:21.176
<i>Let me go.</i>

20:21.263 --> 20:23.134
<i>This is not about me.</i>

20:23.222 --> 20:23.918
<i>That's what you said.</i>

20:27.356 --> 20:30.577
<i>They've all got guns
pointed at me.</i>

20:30.664 --> 20:31.621
Run the video back.

20:31.708 --> 20:33.580
<i>Deja de llorar.</i>

20:33.667 --> 20:35.930
<i>Mira a la cámara
o te mataré.</i>

20:36.017 --> 20:37.323
What's this?

20:40.195 --> 20:42.153
She's in a church.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.720
That's a parclose railing.

20:43.807 --> 20:45.418
In England, the use of those
was discontinued

20:45.505 --> 20:49.204
in the 16th century
after the Reformation.

20:49.291 --> 20:50.858
I'm a nerd
who likes architecture.

20:50.945 --> 20:53.339
But there are a thousand
of those in Barcelona.

20:53.426 --> 20:56.255
170,000 is a odd number
for a ransom payment, right?

20:56.342 --> 20:58.996
Precise amount.
- Right.

20:59.083 --> 21:02.261
From the blog, I made a list
of each woman in Spain

21:02.348 --> 21:04.219
and added up the amount
they were conned out of.

21:04.306 --> 21:06.874
Lydia Herrera stood out.

21:06.961 --> 21:10.443
She wrote that she gave Gerald
50,000, then 80,000,

21:10.530 --> 21:11.966
then 40,000,
which totals...

21:12.053 --> 21:14.447
170,000 euros.

21:14.534 --> 21:17.580
We need to find
Lydia Herrera.

21:19.887 --> 21:21.671
- Scott.
<i>- I just got out of a meeting</i>

21:21.758 --> 21:23.891
<i>with Dandridge.</i>
- And?

21:23.978 --> 21:25.588
<i>They wanted to prep me
for something</i>

21:25.675 --> 21:28.025
<i>called a supervisor
in-service training session</i>

21:28.112 --> 21:29.505
<i>I have to attend.</i>

21:29.592 --> 21:31.420
I'm not sure where.

21:31.507 --> 21:33.901
I waited for him for an hour.

21:33.988 --> 21:36.730
And then he buzzes in,
drops off a couple of binders,

21:36.817 --> 21:39.776
says, "Fill out this paperwork
and wait for more details."

21:39.863 --> 21:42.126
And that required you
to miss this case?

21:42.213 --> 21:45.216
The whole thing seem a little
off, I'm not gonna lie.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.436
Why didn't he just send me
everything by email?

21:47.523 --> 21:49.090
Now I gotta drive
across Budapest

21:49.177 --> 21:51.527
and meet him now in person.

21:51.614 --> 21:54.182
I don't know. Anyway, how's
the case going in Barcelona?

21:54.269 --> 21:55.488
<i>Remember Brent Remis?</i>

21:55.575 --> 21:59.143
Brent Remis... yes.

21:59.230 --> 22:00.884
<i>Real name,
Gerald Frederickson.</i>

22:00.971 --> 22:03.583
He scammed half a dozen women
out of thousands of dollars.

22:03.670 --> 22:05.802
The whole thing
some kind of new grift?

22:05.889 --> 22:07.456
Not sure.
Smitty and Raines

22:07.543 --> 22:09.240
are heading over now to
interview one of the victims.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.068
<i>OK. Keep me posted.</i>

22:11.155 --> 22:12.766
<i>And let me know if there's
anything I can do on my end.</i>

22:12.853 --> 22:14.507
Will do.

22:25.648 --> 22:27.868
I'm Special Agent
Andre Raines with the FBI.

22:27.955 --> 22:29.478
This is Megan Garretson
with Europol.

22:29.565 --> 22:30.479
Hi.

22:33.395 --> 22:36.746
At the time,
he was calling himself Brent.

22:36.833 --> 22:38.661
I met him on a dating app.

22:38.748 --> 22:41.011
There was something different
about him.

22:41.098 --> 22:42.535
How so?

22:42.622 --> 22:45.015
Brent genuinely cared for me.

22:45.102 --> 22:46.539
He made me feel special.

22:46.626 --> 22:47.888
Then he asked you for money

22:47.975 --> 22:49.019
to help him
with his business problems?

22:49.106 --> 22:52.109
He never asked me.
I offered.

22:52.196 --> 22:55.374
He was having some financial
difficulty with his company.

22:55.461 --> 22:57.419
His assets were frozen
until the deal closed.

22:57.506 --> 22:59.769
By now,
you know he's a con man.

22:59.856 --> 23:02.772
Getting you to offer
instead of him asking,

23:02.859 --> 23:04.078
that's part of the game.

23:04.165 --> 23:07.124
Yes, I know.

23:11.085 --> 23:13.130
It would be really great
to have some proper silverware.

23:17.352 --> 23:21.312
Did you hurt yourself

23:21.400 --> 23:23.097
after you found out
about Brent?

23:26.579 --> 23:31.061
I consider myself to be
a strong, competent woman.

23:31.148 --> 23:33.586
But...

23:33.673 --> 23:36.066
Brent broke me.

23:36.153 --> 23:40.549
He tricked me into thinking
our relationship was real.

23:40.636 --> 23:42.421
I went
into a really dark place.

23:47.817 --> 23:49.428
This program
has been good for me.

23:54.476 --> 23:57.000
My father was devastated
when I...

23:59.612 --> 24:02.832
Did your father meet Brent?

24:02.919 --> 24:04.834
He loved him.

24:04.921 --> 24:08.272
He thought I found a good man.

24:08.359 --> 24:13.016
I never before had
a lot of boyfriends.

24:13.103 --> 24:15.410
Does your father know
that Brent was playing you?

24:17.934 --> 24:20.589
Didn't that make your father
angry with Brent?

24:23.113 --> 24:23.940
Did he confront him?

24:27.683 --> 24:28.858
I don't know.

24:28.945 --> 24:30.381
Can we get in touch
with your father?

24:30.469 --> 24:32.993
I'm sorry.
I'm tired.

24:33.080 --> 24:36.170
And I think I've...

24:36.257 --> 24:37.476
answered enough questions.

24:44.874 --> 24:46.833
Brent really
did a number on her.

24:46.920 --> 24:48.748
I bet her pop
was none too pleased.

24:48.835 --> 24:50.663
Did you see Lydia's face
when you asked about him?

24:50.750 --> 24:52.447
- Yeah.
- She went tight-lipped.

24:52.534 --> 24:54.318
And almost ran off when I
asked to get in touch with him.

24:54.405 --> 24:55.929
Yeah,
there's something there.

24:56.016 --> 24:58.235
I felt it too, like
she knew her dad was involved.

24:58.322 --> 25:00.281
I'll alert Kellett.

25:00.368 --> 25:01.804
Got a new angle.

25:01.891 --> 25:02.892
We need to find out
everything we can

25:02.979 --> 25:05.678
about Roberto Herrera,
Lydia's father.

25:07.331 --> 25:09.290
Could this be him?

25:13.424 --> 25:15.339
Is that her father?

25:15.426 --> 25:17.080
I see a resemblance.

25:17.167 --> 25:19.430
His name is not
Roberto Herrera.

25:19.518 --> 25:21.563
It's Roberto De Gracia.

25:21.650 --> 25:23.913
- You know him?
- Every police officer does.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.915
He's the biggest crime lord
in all of Spain.

25:38.841 --> 25:39.973
Roberto De Gracia
is a part

25:40.060 --> 25:41.104
of a notorious
organized crime clan

25:41.191 --> 25:42.628
called Os Nando.

25:42.715 --> 25:44.194
He's been tied
to smuggling drugs,

25:44.281 --> 25:45.500
trafficking,
kidnapping,

25:45.587 --> 25:46.806
multiple homicides,
you name it.

25:46.893 --> 25:48.242
The CNP has never been able

25:48.329 --> 25:50.418
to connect him directly
to an actual crime.

25:50.505 --> 25:53.203
He's like a, how-you-name-him,
Robin Hood?

25:53.290 --> 25:56.076
Pays his taxes, serves
the community, blends in.

25:56.163 --> 25:57.991
We've been trying
to arrest him for years.

25:58.078 --> 25:59.993
So when Lydia's father
found out

26:00.080 --> 26:02.082
she tried to kill herself
because of a con man,

26:02.169 --> 26:04.040
he went nuts,
wanted him dead.

26:04.127 --> 26:06.042
Roberto sent his men
to kidnap Gerald,

26:06.129 --> 26:07.653
but then
the bodyguard intervened

26:07.740 --> 26:08.828
and they botched it.

26:08.915 --> 26:10.177
Grabbed Tiyanna
and Sean Doxon

26:10.264 --> 26:11.918
as leverage

26:12.005 --> 26:13.354
and killed Sean Doxon
when he wasn't useful.

26:13.441 --> 26:15.095
He won't stop there.

26:15.182 --> 26:16.400
He'll kill Tiyanna
and dump her body in a bin

26:16.487 --> 26:18.011
as soon
as she's no longer necessary.

26:18.098 --> 26:20.622
We need to find her now.

26:20.709 --> 26:22.406
Where are we
on locating the church?

26:22.493 --> 26:24.321
My team has narrowed it down
to five.

26:24.408 --> 26:25.714
They're in the field
checking them now.

26:25.801 --> 26:26.933
Check them faster.

26:29.762 --> 26:32.112
It's not a video this time.
It's a phone call.

26:38.901 --> 26:41.338
Whatever they ask for,
agree to it.

26:43.123 --> 26:44.690
<i>You got our message?</i>

26:44.777 --> 26:46.648
Yes.
Yes, I did.

26:46.735 --> 26:47.954
<i>Do you have the money?</i>

26:48.041 --> 26:51.044
I have your 160--
170,000 euros.

26:51.131 --> 26:53.002
<i>Good.
Come alone.</i>

26:53.089 --> 26:54.482
<i>Let me talk to Tiyanna.</i>

26:54.569 --> 26:57.006
<i>We are sending
the address now.</i>

26:57.093 --> 26:59.922
<i>If you go to the police,
we kill her.</i>

27:02.229 --> 27:04.535
Do you know the name
Roberto De Gracia?

27:04.623 --> 27:05.885
No. Should I?

27:10.106 --> 27:12.413
Lydia Herrera's father.

27:12.500 --> 27:14.067
I don't understand.

27:14.154 --> 27:15.895
He's the John Gotti of Spain, Gerald.

27:15.982 --> 27:19.594
CNP suspect he's killed dozens
of men for drug territory,

27:19.681 --> 27:22.031
for gambling rackets, probably
for looking at him sideways.

27:22.118 --> 27:24.730
And here you go
and swindle his daughter.

27:24.817 --> 27:27.515
- I didn't--
- You picked the wrong mark.

27:27.602 --> 27:29.735
- I am innocent, I swear.
- No.

27:29.822 --> 27:32.563
No, Gerald, the two innocent
people in this whole thing

27:32.651 --> 27:35.088
are Tiyanna Lynelle
and Sean Doxon.

27:35.175 --> 27:37.264
One is missing and one is dead.

27:37.351 --> 27:40.528
They're paying the price
for your mistake.

27:40.615 --> 27:43.096
Tiyanna's life is on the line,
and we are running out of time,

27:43.183 --> 27:45.489
so you are gonna do exactly
what I say to get her back.

27:49.885 --> 27:52.235
I'm sorry,

27:52.322 --> 27:54.934
but no.

27:55.021 --> 27:56.370
Excuse me?

27:56.457 --> 27:58.894
<i>You just told me
who her father is.</i>

27:58.981 --> 28:01.549
<i>I'm not gonna risk my life.</i>

28:01.636 --> 28:03.682
<i>It feels like the safest place
for me right now</i>

28:03.769 --> 28:08.164
is here in police custody until
this whole thing blows over.

28:08.251 --> 28:10.950
You are some piece of work.

28:11.037 --> 28:13.256
I love Tiyanna.
That's real.

28:13.343 --> 28:16.085
But this,

28:16.172 --> 28:19.480
I didn't sign up for this.

28:19.567 --> 28:22.265
OK, listen.

28:22.352 --> 28:24.093
I can see what you think of me,

28:24.180 --> 28:25.747
but you're asking me

28:25.834 --> 28:28.097
to do something
life-threatening, correct?

28:32.667 --> 28:34.103
Maybe I can help you,

28:34.190 --> 28:38.238
but I have these charges
hanging over me in the U.S.

28:38.325 --> 28:40.675
<i>And with the stress of that,
with this,</i>

28:40.762 --> 28:42.024
I'm not sure
I'd be able

28:42.111 --> 28:43.809
to control my emotions
to deal with--

28:43.896 --> 28:46.855
This isn't a negotiation.

28:46.942 --> 28:49.815
Everything's a negotiation.

28:49.902 --> 28:53.209
And like you said, Tiyanna
doesn't deserve any of this.

28:58.301 --> 28:59.476
I'll need it in writing.

29:11.445 --> 29:13.490
The cojones on this guy.

29:13.577 --> 29:15.275
But this may be our only
chance of saving her life.

29:15.362 --> 29:16.711
- A plea?
- Yeah.

29:16.798 --> 29:18.365
We need him to find her.

29:22.673 --> 29:23.979
I'll call the AUSA
in New York.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.508
We got two minutes.
- He's wired.

29:31.595 --> 29:33.554
Both you and the bag
are online.

29:33.641 --> 29:35.556
I'm not gonna run,
if that's what you're thinking.

29:35.643 --> 29:36.949
I'm thinking how much
I would enjoy it if you tried.

29:37.036 --> 29:38.820
My team is in position
around the park.

29:38.907 --> 29:40.691
Kellett will be on lookout
from the cafe.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.258
I'll take the south end bench
by the stairs.

29:42.345 --> 29:44.304
Vo, take the north end corner.

29:44.391 --> 29:45.871
Raines will cover the park
from the van.

29:45.958 --> 29:48.264
We've got cameras
all around to track you.

29:48.351 --> 29:49.918
All right.
Eyes sharp, everyone.

29:50.005 --> 29:52.878
Get the kidnappers to stay
on the phone for 60 seconds.

29:52.965 --> 29:55.358
Just thinking how nice
it'll be to get back to Ohio.

29:55.445 --> 29:57.056
I thought you were
from Rhode Island.

29:57.143 --> 29:58.797
I'm from all over.

29:58.884 --> 30:02.322
Listen, Gerald,
dying men speak truth.

30:02.409 --> 30:05.716
Do you want to wait
until it gets to that point?

30:05.804 --> 30:07.675
Time to roll out.

30:24.474 --> 30:26.259
<i>The perimeter is secured.</i>

30:33.962 --> 30:35.921
<i>He's entering the park.</i>

30:44.103 --> 30:46.061
<i>Just keep walking straight.</i>

30:50.326 --> 30:52.589
He is just passing
my location.

30:59.509 --> 31:01.511
Head to the bench
the elderly man just passed.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.707
<i>We need 60 seconds.</i>

31:27.189 --> 31:29.757
<i>Go to the top of the stairs.</i>

31:29.844 --> 31:33.587
- I have your money.
<i>- Don't make me repeat myself.</i>

31:33.674 --> 31:34.893
They're just making sure
you weren't followed.

31:34.980 --> 31:36.982
<i>Keep walking.</i>

31:37.069 --> 31:39.985
<i>Keep them on the phone
for at least 60 seconds.</i>

31:48.036 --> 31:49.603
I got eyes on a man
in blue pants,

31:49.690 --> 31:51.170
dark glasses,
head lowered.

31:51.257 --> 31:52.432
<i>Headed in Gerald's direction.</i>

31:54.913 --> 31:57.132
Stand by, everyone.

31:58.264 --> 31:59.613
<i>Stay calm, Gerald.</i>

32:04.357 --> 32:05.271
Not our guy.

32:08.491 --> 32:09.753
Ten more seconds.
You're doing good.

32:09.840 --> 32:11.059
Is Tiyanna alive?

32:15.934 --> 32:19.372
Please, just let me see
Tiyanna alive on FaceTime.

32:19.459 --> 32:21.722
I'm doing what I was told.

32:21.809 --> 32:23.506
<i>Brent,
they're gonna kill me.</i>

32:25.204 --> 32:27.336
- 58 seconds.
- Not long enough.

32:27.423 --> 32:29.121
Raines, were you able
to get a location?

32:33.603 --> 32:35.301
OK, we've got it down
to a five-mile area,

32:35.388 --> 32:36.911
<i>and we're right
in the middle of it.</i>

32:36.998 --> 32:39.305
<i>Looking for any
of the possible churches.</i>

32:45.920 --> 32:48.183
This is one of the churches
from our list.

32:48.270 --> 32:49.576
OK, we have
a possible location.

32:49.663 --> 32:51.230
<i>Iglesia de Santa Ursula.</i>

32:51.317 --> 32:53.797
It's eight blocks north.
It's closed for renovations.

32:53.884 --> 32:55.538
There's a church
on the possible list

32:55.625 --> 32:56.975
<i>eight blocks away.</i>

32:57.062 --> 32:57.845
<i>It's within radius.</i>

32:57.932 --> 32:59.499
<i>Iglesia de Santa Ursula.</i>

32:59.586 --> 33:01.196
We'll take it.

33:01.283 --> 33:02.458
<i>I will meet you there.</i>

33:02.545 --> 33:03.372
OK, let's go.
- OK.

33:18.735 --> 33:19.867
FBI! Don't move!

33:32.967 --> 33:34.577
Move.

33:34.664 --> 33:37.232
Moving.

33:51.377 --> 33:52.943
Help!
Help me!

33:53.031 --> 33:54.206
Help!

33:55.990 --> 33:57.948
Help! Help me!

33:58.036 --> 33:59.646
Ow.
- Move!

33:59.733 --> 34:00.951
Moving!

34:06.392 --> 34:08.220
No, no, no!

34:08.307 --> 34:09.351
No, no, no!

34:11.353 --> 34:12.702
Help me!
Help me!

34:12.789 --> 34:14.400
Help, please!

34:17.055 --> 34:18.360
Over here!

34:20.623 --> 34:21.450
Help me!

34:25.802 --> 34:28.979
No signs
of Roberto De Garcia.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.198
Guys like that have
dummies this like this

34:30.285 --> 34:31.373
to do their dirty work.

34:31.460 --> 34:32.722
No,
this was personal for him.

34:32.809 --> 34:34.420
His daughter tried
to kill herself.

34:38.554 --> 34:40.295
This was never
about kidnapping Tiyanna.

34:40.382 --> 34:42.167
This was about getting
to Gerald Frederickson.

34:44.430 --> 34:46.084
Smitty,
you have eyes on Gerald?

34:46.171 --> 34:49.652
<i>I don't have a clear view
of him on my monitors.</i>

34:49.739 --> 34:50.914
He's still on the bench.

34:51.001 --> 34:52.960
<i>Get him out.</i>

34:53.047 --> 34:54.788
Repeat that?

34:54.875 --> 34:57.530
The kidnapping was a decoy
to draw out Gerald.

35:01.055 --> 35:02.926
Hey, Gerald,
let's go.

35:03.013 --> 35:04.754
We've gotta go.
We've gotta go--

35:21.815 --> 35:23.686
Drop it!

35:25.427 --> 35:27.125
Roberto De Gracia!

35:28.735 --> 35:30.171
Drop it!

35:37.265 --> 35:38.223
Don't do it.

35:57.894 --> 36:00.288
You're OK.

36:00.375 --> 36:02.072
The vest caught those bullets.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.770
He's gonna have bruises
the size of grapefruits,

36:03.857 --> 36:05.163
but he'll live.

36:05.250 --> 36:07.121
Not so much for De Gracia.

36:07.208 --> 36:09.863
I did everything
that you asked.

36:13.606 --> 36:15.651
The man you know
as Brent Remis

36:15.738 --> 36:19.525
is actually
Gerald Frederickson, a con man.

36:19.612 --> 36:22.876
He swindled dozens of women
just like you.

36:22.963 --> 36:25.835
- No, no.
- I'm sorry, but it's true.

36:25.922 --> 36:28.403
Brent, he wouldn't do that.

36:28.490 --> 36:33.365
Brent conned Lydia Herrera
out of 170,000 euros.

36:33.452 --> 36:35.367
And it caused her
such emotional turmoil,

36:35.454 --> 36:36.890
she tried
to take her own life.

36:36.977 --> 36:38.326
Oh, my God.

36:38.413 --> 36:40.198
Gerald told Lydia
he loved her,

36:40.285 --> 36:41.764
just like he did you.

36:41.851 --> 36:44.202
Her father is the one
who kidnapped you.

36:44.289 --> 36:45.768
He couldn't stand
his only daughter

36:45.855 --> 36:48.031
being conned like that.

36:48.118 --> 36:52.340
Brent--Gerald--
whatever his name is,

36:52.427 --> 36:54.429
he risked his life for me, right?

36:54.516 --> 36:55.778
He only agreed to help

36:55.865 --> 36:58.041
if we could reduce
his charges back home.

37:04.831 --> 37:07.225
Thank you all for everything.

37:07.312 --> 37:08.965
What happens
to Gerald Frederickson?

37:09.052 --> 37:11.011
The district attorney
cleared his record in New York,

37:11.098 --> 37:12.926
but he conned several women
in Spain.

37:13.013 --> 37:15.581
After he took two gunshots
while in our custody,

37:15.668 --> 37:18.366
I don't think anyone around
here wants to make an arrest.

37:18.453 --> 37:21.413
Better for this part
of the case to just disappear.

37:21.500 --> 37:23.719
So he walks?

37:23.806 --> 37:25.460
Justice was done.

37:25.547 --> 37:29.638
And Roberto De Gracia's reign
of terror in Spain is over,

37:29.725 --> 37:32.206
so again,
thank you.

37:42.303 --> 37:43.261
Here you are, sir.

37:47.134 --> 37:49.615
- Tiyanna, baby, I--
- Brent.

37:49.702 --> 37:51.747
Or is it Gerald?

37:51.834 --> 37:54.794
Look, we have a lot
to talk about, OK?

37:54.881 --> 37:56.012
Let's go get a drink somewhere.

38:00.321 --> 38:04.238
You're a back-alley con man
and a scumbag,

38:04.325 --> 38:06.066
so I did what I had to do.

38:06.153 --> 38:07.633
What do you mean?

38:07.720 --> 38:11.985
Goodbye,
whatever your name is.

38:12.072 --> 38:15.510
Tiyanna's statement helped
add some additional charges.

38:17.643 --> 38:20.341
Did I forget to mention
all the U.S. federal charges

38:20.428 --> 38:22.604
were waived but we don't
enforce state laws?

38:22.691 --> 38:24.867
That's for the Manhattan DA
to decide.

38:24.954 --> 38:27.348
But we forgot to talk to him.
- No, you said if I--

38:27.435 --> 38:29.698
You're gonna have
to wait a bit to see Ohio.

38:34.007 --> 38:36.444
OK, that was worth
the price of admission.

38:41.884 --> 38:43.930
So what's your ex-boyfriend
story, Smitty,

38:44.017 --> 38:45.975
the one you mentioned
back in Manchester?

38:46.062 --> 38:48.326
Well, we dated a few years.

38:48.413 --> 38:50.415
We were dating
when I met Scott, actually.

38:50.502 --> 38:53.069
And I realized,
like Gerald Frederickson,

38:53.156 --> 38:55.507
that he was a smug,

38:55.594 --> 38:57.639
self-centered,
self-important dirtbag.

38:57.726 --> 39:00.120
And I ran for the exits.
- A wanker.

39:00.207 --> 39:02.035
Now you're getting it.

39:02.122 --> 39:06.518
OK, Smitty, now that
you're in a confessional mood,

39:06.605 --> 39:07.736
just tell us.

39:07.823 --> 39:08.563
Tell you what?

39:11.784 --> 39:13.568
Where the name Smitty
comes from.

39:13.655 --> 39:15.004
Oh.

39:15.091 --> 39:17.659
I'm not sure I can
disclose that just yet.

39:17.746 --> 39:18.834
Has to be
an undercover alias,

39:18.921 --> 39:20.923
something Europol assigned
when she joined up.

39:21.010 --> 39:23.273
Or she really likes apples.

39:23.361 --> 39:25.058
- What?
- Granny Smith.

39:25.145 --> 39:27.190
- No.
- No.

39:27.277 --> 39:31.717
OK, all right,
I'm guessing DJ name.

39:31.804 --> 39:33.066
None of these
are anywhere close.

39:33.153 --> 39:34.807
Oh, I got it.

39:34.894 --> 39:37.679
Your full name
is Megan Smith Garretson,

39:37.766 --> 39:39.202
and this whole thing
is one big con.

39:39.289 --> 39:41.117
You are definitely wrong...

39:41.204 --> 39:42.554
or are you?

39:45.861 --> 39:47.428
Hey.

39:47.515 --> 39:48.777
You look like
you're having fun.

39:48.864 --> 39:50.213
Always.

39:50.300 --> 39:51.258
Another old fashioned?

39:51.345 --> 39:53.608
Ooh, you know me so well.

39:55.828 --> 39:58.134
I want to apologize
for this morning.

39:58.221 --> 39:59.832
- Why?
- I shouldn't have asked you

39:59.919 --> 40:01.921
about your dad and sister.
- No need.

40:02.008 --> 40:04.837
I want to be open with you,
see where this can go.

40:04.924 --> 40:06.447
But with baby steps.

40:08.710 --> 40:11.321
You OK
with my job coming first?

40:11.409 --> 40:13.236
'Cause a lot of women I've met
say they are,

40:13.323 --> 40:15.369
but then
when reality rears its head,

40:15.456 --> 40:16.326
they have second thoughts.

40:19.504 --> 40:22.289
Are you OK with
letting me inside a little?

40:22.376 --> 40:24.509
Yeah, I could do that.

40:24.596 --> 40:26.336
I just hope you still like me

40:26.424 --> 40:27.903
after you see
what's inside here.

40:27.990 --> 40:29.644
I'll just have to jump in
with both feet

40:29.731 --> 40:32.473
and let the river take us
wherever it goes.

40:38.261 --> 40:40.350
- What are you doing?
- Deleting my dating apps.

40:44.180 --> 40:45.660
OK.

40:48.794 --> 40:50.230
Then I will too.
