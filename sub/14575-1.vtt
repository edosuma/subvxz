01:11.640 --> 01:12.971
Happy birthday, Hopey.

01:14.120 --> 01:17.727
Nice. Beautiful. One more.

01:19.120 --> 01:20.201
Show me your somersault.

01:23.440 --> 01:25.900
- Climb the wall.
- Almost.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.331
Look, she's doing a handstand.

01:27.440 --> 01:28.487
Come on!

01:28.680 --> 01:31.081
That's it, all the way! Come on!

01:32.320 --> 01:34.740
- Huggie, Dad.
- Come here. That's good for a huggie.

01:34.840 --> 01:37.446
Just like that. Okay.
Let's see those jumps again, the split up.

01:38.560 --> 01:40.340
Good. Good! Much better.

01:40.440 --> 01:41.900
Future champion.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.571
Here's the big moment.
It's all about the dismount. Ready?

01:45.720 --> 01:48.246
No, no, no, no, no. Good.

01:48.520 --> 01:51.922
- I'm a champion.
- You're darn right, you are. Try it again.

01:55.080 --> 01:58.500
Point the toes. Chin up. Tight, tight.

01:58.600 --> 02:01.331
Show how beautiful and talented you are.
Perfect hand.

02:01.760 --> 02:06.209
Are those boobs coming in? No boobs!

02:08.720 --> 02:09.721
I like that.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.606
- To gold in Rome!
- Gold in Rome!

02:23.080 --> 02:24.650
USA! USA! USA!

02:26.840 --> 02:29.730
I just marvel every time
I see Hope Ann Greggory perform.

02:30.240 --> 02:33.289
At 17, she is the epitome
of power and grace.

02:34.560 --> 02:37.530
Coach Pavleck says
she is the hardest worker on the team.

02:49.360 --> 02:52.125
Mother... Mother...

02:52.520 --> 02:54.568
This is a potentially career-ending injury.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.081
Focus.

02:58.520 --> 03:01.220
- I don't want that. I don't want that.
- She said no.

03:01.320 --> 03:06.008
No wheelchair. She's determined
to get off on her own power.

03:07.640 --> 03:08.926
Wait. Hold on, Dominique.

03:09.080 --> 03:13.802
I am now getting word Greggory is
going to attempt the uneven bars.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.891
- This is truly inspirational.
- It really is.

03:18.280 --> 03:21.020
This, ladies and gentlemen,
is quite remarkable.

03:21.120 --> 03:22.565
You are star.

03:23.560 --> 03:26.260
You will make me so proud.

03:26.360 --> 03:30.888
Thousands of hours training together
back at that little gym in Amherst, Ohio.

03:31.040 --> 03:33.486
This is their moment.

03:34.480 --> 03:38.451
USA! USA! USA!

03:39.280 --> 03:41.380
This is the Amherst Angel's strongest event

03:41.480 --> 03:46.008
and she's going to need a 9.7 or higher
to take the medal away from those Russians.

03:46.120 --> 03:49.820
She needs to pull off this Jaeger.
Nearly flawless, nearly flawless.

03:49.920 --> 03:51.843
Beautiful handstand half.

03:54.200 --> 03:56.260
Now she's preparing
for her full-end dismount.

03:56.360 --> 03:59.780
This is a tough dismount for her.
She needs to stick this landing.

03:59.880 --> 04:03.362
- This is really tough to watch.
- Here it comes. Full twist.

04:04.840 --> 04:07.580
- On one leg!
- Do you believe in miracles?

04:07.680 --> 04:11.810
You do now!
The Amherst Angel has stuck the landing.

04:19.240 --> 04:21.208
Hopey! What do you want for lunch?

04:22.040 --> 04:24.247
Grilled cheese and tomato!

04:25.320 --> 04:26.340
No crust!

04:26.440 --> 04:27.566
9.8!

04:28.120 --> 04:32.100
She's done the impossible!
This is absolutely incredible, Dominique!

04:32.200 --> 04:33.645
Goodness, she could never write this...

04:42.360 --> 04:45.330
Ladies and gentlemen, please stand
for the Chinese national anthem.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.241
Hopey!

05:47.680 --> 05:50.340
Hopey? Your grilled cheese is ready.

05:50.440 --> 05:52.740
What? No, I said I wanted Hamburger Helper!

05:52.840 --> 05:55.380
Where the fuck did you get
grilled cheese? Just forget it, Dad.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.970
I'm gonna go to Sbarro.

06:04.560 --> 06:06.289
Mountain Dew, large.

06:06.560 --> 06:08.483
- Diet?
- Did I say diet?

06:09.000 --> 06:10.729
Sorry. Most girls order diet.

06:11.400 --> 06:16.201
- Okay. That comes to $9.30.
- No, it doesn't.

06:16.360 --> 06:18.647
No, no, no. She's on the house.

06:18.840 --> 06:20.860
- Don't you know who this is?
- You tell him, Tony.

06:20.960 --> 06:24.681
- Check the wall, son.
- Yeah. Check the wall, son.

06:25.480 --> 06:27.050
You used to be way skinnier.

06:33.920 --> 06:34.967
Hey, Hope.

06:35.920 --> 06:38.002
- Take these.
- Okay.

06:39.720 --> 06:44.123
- Any new stuff in the back?
- Yeah, totally.

06:45.080 --> 06:49.180
It's supposed to be bomb-ass shit.
He said it was government grade.

06:49.280 --> 06:53.300
I don't know if that means
that the government grows it,

06:53.400 --> 06:55.260
or maybe they just grade it?

06:55.360 --> 06:57.169
Stop you right there.

06:57.840 --> 07:02.528
Do not talk about politics. It's crass.
You're gonna lose a lot of customers.

07:04.080 --> 07:06.321
But you don't... You don't pay me.

07:08.760 --> 07:10.000
Hey, John.

07:19.600 --> 07:22.285
- Chair busted again, Davey?
- Yeah.

07:25.520 --> 07:27.409
Here. Go get it fixed.

07:30.920 --> 07:32.365
Thanks, Hope.

08:04.360 --> 08:07.603
I like the new running sneakers,
they're very hip.

08:08.240 --> 08:12.500
Yeah. They send me so frickin' many
for endorsements.

08:12.600 --> 08:14.940
At some point, I'm gonna have to tell 'em
to back the fuck off.

08:15.040 --> 08:19.409
I know it must get old for you,
but you lead such a glamorous life.

08:20.680 --> 08:22.011
Hi, Doris!

08:24.320 --> 08:27.767
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
Hope Ann Greggory is here!

08:30.520 --> 08:31.860
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

08:31.960 --> 08:34.645
Isn't that Maggie Townsend adorable?

08:34.799 --> 08:37.580
She comes in here all the time
with your old Coach Pavleck.

08:37.679 --> 08:39.380
OMG! Hope Ann Greggory.

08:39.480 --> 08:42.220
I have been, like, praying that
we would run into each other. I'm Maggie.

08:42.320 --> 08:46.580
Hope, this is Maggie.
I'm surprised you two haven't crossed paths.

08:46.680 --> 08:50.420
Maggie reminds me so much of you
when you were younger.

08:50.520 --> 08:51.681
Hey, Hope.

08:53.240 --> 08:55.447
- Hi.
- It's me, Ben.

08:57.200 --> 09:01.000
Ben Lawfort.
My dad co-owns the gym with Coach P.

09:02.320 --> 09:03.401
Twitchy.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.167
Yeah. No one really calls me that anymore.

09:07.840 --> 09:11.780
In fact, you were the only person that did.
But, hey, I'm back in town.

09:11.880 --> 09:13.689
- Graduated, finally.
- You look so different.

09:13.960 --> 09:16.900
- Really?
- But that's still there, so now I see it.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.340
Yeah, well, anyway,
I'm helping Coach P with Maggie here.

09:21.440 --> 09:24.060
Coach was saying that she's trying
to get a hold of you. I don't know if...

09:24.160 --> 09:26.481
- Did you just say you graduated?
- I did.

09:26.640 --> 09:28.244
Aren't you, like, 12?

09:28.560 --> 09:33.566
No. I was 12 when I was 12.

09:35.120 --> 09:38.020
I was 12 when you won
your first World Championship,

09:38.120 --> 09:39.220
so maybe that was what you...

09:39.320 --> 09:40.900
Isn't that funny?

09:41.000 --> 09:44.580
Maggie just made it to the top five
of the World Championship.

09:44.680 --> 09:45.980
I heard.

09:46.080 --> 09:48.003
I, like, totally crushed it.

09:49.440 --> 09:52.820
Miss Greggory, maybe we could
exchange phone numbers, or something,

09:52.920 --> 09:57.005
and we could text or FaceTime,
or I don't know...

10:15.080 --> 10:18.721
Hope? Can we talk a second?

10:20.080 --> 10:21.081
What?

10:21.200 --> 10:24.090
Do you remember when you made
this for me, the first day of art class?

10:27.600 --> 10:29.420
It was the greatest day of my life.

10:29.520 --> 10:33.700
So, I'm beginning
with that positive affirmation.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.580
Yeah. It was your idea
for a lame Father's Day art project.

10:36.680 --> 10:38.260
Are you done remenessing about homeschool?

10:38.360 --> 10:40.700
- It's "reminiscing," sweetie.
- That's what I said.

10:40.800 --> 10:43.460
A good use of a vocab word.
Come here, sit.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.210
Standing, go, what?

10:46.840 --> 10:49.700
My supervisor has had several complaints

10:49.800 --> 10:52.940
that pieces of mail from my route
have gone missing again.

10:53.040 --> 10:54.420
So, suck less.

10:54.520 --> 10:57.220
Honey, I know you've been
stealing from my truck again.

10:57.320 --> 10:59.049
That's ridiculous.

11:00.680 --> 11:02.728
I found these in my mailbag.

11:03.320 --> 11:06.164
- Maybe your truck has rats.
- I don't think so.

11:07.240 --> 11:09.242
Hopey, you promised you'd get a job.

11:09.760 --> 11:12.047
And I've been looking.
Where do you think I've been all day?

11:12.680 --> 11:14.762
I ran into Coach P at the market.

11:14.960 --> 11:17.300
She really wants to
put the past behind you guys.

11:17.400 --> 11:20.290
She said that
she could use someone like you.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.161
What do you mean by "market"?

11:24.160 --> 11:26.766
- The grocery store.
- Then just say that. You're not a pilgrim.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.446
Have you thought any more
about working at the gym?

11:31.720 --> 11:35.340
I'm not a coach, I'm a star!
I was on Dancing with the Stars!

11:35.440 --> 11:37.260
It's not called Dancing with the Coaches!

11:37.360 --> 11:40.700
When athletes get injured,
they need to make other plans.

11:40.800 --> 11:44.771
I don't need another plan.
You and Coach P don't listen. I healed.

11:46.400 --> 11:47.447
Not exactly.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.180
Well, you weren't worried
about how "exactly"

11:53.280 --> 11:55.203
when you pushed me
to go for another medal.

11:55.800 --> 12:00.340
How many times can I tell you that I'm sorry?
I was wrong. We were both wrong.

12:00.440 --> 12:02.807
It's worse for an adult to be wrong.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.286
That's true.

12:04.480 --> 12:07.860
And may I remind you that
my awesomeness paid for this entire house...

12:07.960 --> 12:10.220
- That money's long gone.
- ...the motor boat, the Ronco Rotisserie...

12:10.320 --> 12:12.700
We depend entirely on my salary these days,
and in six months,

12:12.800 --> 12:14.420
all we'll have left is my pension!

12:14.520 --> 12:17.060
I know, I know. This is so boring!

12:17.160 --> 12:20.580
No, no, you listen to me.
It'll be less than half of what I make now.

12:20.680 --> 12:23.500
Not enough to support both of us
and this lifestyle of yours.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.180
I don't have a lifestyle.

12:25.280 --> 12:28.780
That's if I even make it to the pension
I've worked over 30 years to earn

12:28.880 --> 12:30.940
since my daughter
keeps putting that in jeopardy

12:31.040 --> 12:32.644
by stealing from the US Postal Service!

12:32.840 --> 12:36.208
- I'm borrowing. That's not a crime.
- It's a federal crime!

12:36.400 --> 12:37.731
- And I won't stand for it!
- Dad...

12:37.880 --> 12:39.689
No, no, enough!

12:43.960 --> 12:46.486
You don't know what it's like
to grow up without a mom.

12:48.520 --> 12:51.490
It's so hard being
a motherless daughter, Daddy.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.690
I know, sweetie.

12:55.480 --> 12:58.962
No six-month-old should have to
deal with that kind of a loss.

12:59.720 --> 13:01.688
Five-and-a-half-month-old.

13:03.720 --> 13:08.020
We're not done here. I'm setting boundaries.
No more allowance.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.282
Are you insane? Why are you insane?

13:10.440 --> 13:12.886
Hope Annabelle, let's de-escalate, shall we?

13:13.040 --> 13:15.980
You're cutting off my allowance
and you want me to stop stealing?

13:16.080 --> 13:19.820
- What kind of a sick monster are you?
- Do not call me a monster.

13:19.920 --> 13:23.208
You only give me $500 a week,
so I'm forced to steal!

13:23.400 --> 13:25.860
If you cut off my allowance,
I'm gonna have to suck dicks

13:25.960 --> 13:27.380
in a Cost Final bathroom for money!

13:27.480 --> 13:28.620
Is that what you want, Dad?

13:28.720 --> 13:31.620
Do you want me to suck on dirty dicks
in a discount warehouse toilet?

13:31.720 --> 13:35.122
Look, I never said that dirty dicks
were the solution here.

13:35.880 --> 13:39.220
Why do you need all this money
if I'm paying for the roof over your head?

13:39.320 --> 13:42.403
- Your gas, your car...
- You are way too up in my shit!

13:44.760 --> 13:46.250
I need my privacy.

13:50.280 --> 13:51.406
All right.

14:03.160 --> 14:05.766
What happened to our little girl, Bradley?

14:45.000 --> 14:46.047
Fuck you.

15:16.640 --> 15:19.803
- Dad! Did you get my sub?
- On the table!

15:21.760 --> 15:23.888
Where are the pepperoncinis?

15:24.760 --> 15:25.980
I forgot!

15:26.080 --> 15:28.100
Are you trying to ruin my life?

15:28.200 --> 15:32.762
No. But I did want to talk to you
about looking for a job.

15:33.320 --> 15:35.049
Dad! Eating!

15:36.520 --> 15:40.206
Coach Eleyna Pavleck was found dead
last night of an apparent suicide.

15:40.680 --> 15:41.660
My God...

15:41.760 --> 15:43.967
The former coach of bronze medalist,
Hope Ann Greggory,

15:44.080 --> 15:47.880
was currently helming the career of
elite gymnast, Maggie Townsend,

15:48.320 --> 15:50.322
also from Amherst, Ohio.

15:50.480 --> 15:51.540
Well, as you can imagine,

15:51.640 --> 15:55.122
it's a very sad day here at
the Eleyna Pavleck Gymnastics Center.

15:55.320 --> 15:59.620
Pavleck had spent recent years guiding
the career of Mighty Maggie Townsend.

15:59.720 --> 16:01.900
Experts agree
that Townsend has the potential

16:02.000 --> 16:05.368
to surpass Greggory's bronze
at this year's Toronto Games

16:05.520 --> 16:08.860
as a leading contender
for the US Women's Team.

16:08.960 --> 16:10.610
Karen, back to you.

16:11.040 --> 16:14.660
Sources say Pavleck was
coaching Townsend free of charge

16:14.760 --> 16:17.660
as her single mother
could not afford the expenses

16:17.760 --> 16:20.240
associated with an elite training program.

16:20.920 --> 16:23.100
Mike's up next with the Ohio weather
and the lottery numbers.

16:23.200 --> 16:24.420
Fuck.

16:24.520 --> 16:27.091
Hope? You okay?

16:27.200 --> 16:31.171
Why would they show that picture of me?
There are so many hotter ones.

16:33.520 --> 16:35.568
Are you all right, sweetie?

16:35.880 --> 16:38.531
This sub sucks without the pepperoncinis.

16:40.560 --> 16:44.580
Hope, did you hear
what they said about Coach P?

16:44.680 --> 16:47.126
Are you all right? Do you need a huggie?

16:47.280 --> 16:49.487
No, I do not! I'm not five!

16:49.600 --> 16:52.220
Hope, it's okay, you can feel bad.
There's nothing wrong with...

16:52.320 --> 16:55.085
Stop treating me like I'm fucking five!

17:13.040 --> 17:14.040
Hey.

17:14.760 --> 17:18.320
Yo. Which one of you guys
want to buy me a drink?

17:23.160 --> 17:24.366
That's me.

17:26.240 --> 17:27.605
- That's you?
- Yep.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.365
You look nice.

17:30.160 --> 17:31.924
I still, like, hardly ever get my period.

17:33.160 --> 17:35.049
So, you don't gotta worry
about knocking me up.

17:35.160 --> 17:36.810
You could fuck me all raw and shit.

17:40.920 --> 17:45.164
- So, if we buy you a drink...
- Will I let you double team me? Absolutely.

17:45.320 --> 17:47.687
Could you just leave us alone?

18:02.400 --> 18:03.925
I fucking hate you.

18:07.800 --> 18:09.006
Sweetie.

18:12.360 --> 18:13.805
Huggie, Daddy.

18:16.440 --> 18:19.364
Huggie. Huggie, huggie.

18:33.120 --> 18:35.043
How you doing today, honey?

18:36.040 --> 18:37.610
I just woke up.

18:37.720 --> 18:40.564
Give me a chance
to orientate myself for the day.

18:41.880 --> 18:45.060
Save that Bed, Bath & Beyond coupon,
I need to get some stuff there.

18:45.160 --> 18:47.891
I don't know what money
you're gonna use for that.

18:50.160 --> 18:51.650
This is for you.

18:52.520 --> 18:54.887
Can you read it? My eyes are ti-ti.

19:04.720 --> 19:06.245
What, read it.

19:06.800 --> 19:08.370
It's from Coach P.

19:14.080 --> 19:16.540
Okay. "Dearest Hope.

19:16.640 --> 19:20.565
"By the time you receive letter,
you will already know that I'm gone.

19:20.960 --> 19:25.180
"You have been angry at me,
but what I said to you was for your good.

19:25.280 --> 19:27.681
"I pray you see that one day.

19:28.320 --> 19:33.406
"From the treasures of my life's chest,
I leave you $500,000."

19:33.840 --> 19:35.444
Shit. $500...

19:36.080 --> 19:39.084
"But you must listen
that these monies are yours

19:39.280 --> 19:42.260
"under the steadiest condition
that you train the daffodil

19:42.360 --> 19:44.700
"who is about to peak through the snow,

19:44.800 --> 19:48.282
"my dancing flower gymnast,
Maggie Townsend,

19:48.520 --> 19:51.020
"through to the end of her
Toronto Games campaign."

19:51.120 --> 19:52.929
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

19:53.120 --> 19:57.220
"My will trustee will present your fortune
when the sun has set on your duties.

19:57.320 --> 20:01.220
"No matter the outcome,
once Maggie's campaign is done,

20:01.320 --> 20:03.500
"this payment will manifest.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.682
"No one must know of this bounty
that waits for you.

20:05.920 --> 20:10.369
"It must appear that Maggie proceeds
in your care from the goodness of your heart.

20:10.680 --> 20:13.889
"I know you can do this, Hope. Farewell."

20:17.880 --> 20:20.281
I'd rather die than train that loser.

20:20.400 --> 20:23.020
Can't you see
that Coach P loves you so much

20:23.120 --> 20:25.407
that she wanted you
to have this opportunity?

20:25.680 --> 20:28.001
Half a million dollars.
That's a lot of money.

20:30.560 --> 20:32.164
It says $500,000.

20:33.640 --> 20:34.801
That's half a million.

20:35.160 --> 20:36.980
- Jesus, I know! You're so annoying!
- Well, it could be...

20:37.080 --> 20:38.140
- Stop talking, I'm thinking!
- All I'm saying...

20:38.240 --> 20:40.004
Stop talking, I'm thinking!

20:41.440 --> 20:42.601
- Dad, come on!
- I'm not talking!

20:42.720 --> 20:45.007
You're talking, I'm thinking! Stop!

20:45.400 --> 20:46.561
Stop.

20:49.720 --> 20:53.220
I hear you breathing. You're always
disrupting my thought processes.

20:53.320 --> 20:56.130
How can anyone think with your breathing?

21:12.760 --> 21:15.220
- Maggie here?
- Hope Ann Greggory.

21:15.320 --> 21:18.483
- I'm Janice, I'm Maggie's mom.
- Okay.

21:19.080 --> 21:20.206
Please come in.

21:21.400 --> 21:25.689
It's such an honor.
I was such a fan of yours growing up.

21:26.040 --> 21:29.140
I know I'm a few years older,
but I really looked up to you.

21:29.240 --> 21:32.289
I think you're more than a few years older.
You're a mom.

21:33.880 --> 21:35.370
Yeah. Caught me.

21:37.280 --> 21:38.691
Come in.

21:39.040 --> 21:42.487
Hey, Maggie,
Miss Greggory's here to see you.

21:46.120 --> 21:48.282
- Hi.
- 'Sup.

21:50.120 --> 21:52.122
Guess I'm your new coach.

21:53.480 --> 21:56.768
You're my idol
and that would be super awesome,

21:57.800 --> 21:59.723
but I'm quitting gymnastics.

22:00.200 --> 22:03.966
Hon... Maggie.
Honey, you don't mean that. Right?

22:05.440 --> 22:07.761
You sure? Go with your gut.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.447
Hey, Maggie. Why don't you show
Miss Greggory your picture?

22:13.760 --> 22:15.091
Okay? All right.

22:15.240 --> 22:18.483
Well, I'm just gonna
leave you two ladies alone then.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.523
You know, we've met before.

22:26.920 --> 22:29.605
- Yeah, I know. The diner.
- Before that.

22:31.480 --> 22:36.611
I was living in Harrisburg and you were
at the mall signing pictures when I was five.

22:41.280 --> 22:43.487
I told you I wanted to be a gymnast,

22:45.200 --> 22:47.601
and you wrote, "Go for it."

22:49.920 --> 22:52.380
I keep it in that drawer
with a picture of my dad.

22:52.480 --> 22:54.448
He left when I was three, so...

22:54.800 --> 22:57.100
My mom died
when I was five-and-a-half months old.

22:57.200 --> 22:59.202
Mine's a fuck of a lot worse.

23:02.480 --> 23:04.847
I can't believe you're in my room right now.

23:05.120 --> 23:09.125
Let's go back to you giving up.
It's an excellent decision. I'll tell your mom.

23:09.520 --> 23:12.091
- Coach P used to do that to me.
- What?

23:12.880 --> 23:14.484
Reverse psychology.

23:15.720 --> 23:18.007
You were right. I'm gonna go for it.

23:18.680 --> 23:20.205
I wrote that on everybody's.

23:20.320 --> 23:23.244
You don't have to do it anymore, I'm in.
When do we start?

23:26.320 --> 23:29.324
I don't know.
Just be at the gym tomorrow morning.

23:30.320 --> 23:33.290
Coach P always used to drive me
'cause my mom works all the time.

23:34.160 --> 23:36.083
Jesus, how high maintenance are you?

23:36.320 --> 23:39.369
You're funny.
I'll be ready at 7:00 a.m., okay?

23:39.720 --> 23:41.563
I'll pick you up at noon.

24:10.160 --> 24:11.730
- Where is everyone?
- Ben?

24:12.560 --> 24:14.260
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Ben.

24:14.360 --> 24:15.964
You guys get stuck in traffic or something?

24:18.120 --> 24:21.100
Well, I know it's a little light,
but my dad promised Coach P

24:21.200 --> 24:24.602
that we'd keep Maggie's training sessions
private so she could focus.

24:25.200 --> 24:26.964
I'm gonna go change, okay?

24:33.040 --> 24:35.042
So, should we get started?

24:35.760 --> 24:38.889
I got it covered.
Feel free to hang around and look pretty.

24:42.120 --> 24:44.202
Well, I have to be here, anyway.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.140
Managing the place
while my dad's out of town, so...

24:46.240 --> 24:47.860
All right, fine. Here's the deal, Twitchy.

24:47.960 --> 24:50.566
- I'm the pilot, you're the...
- Co-pilot. Got it.

24:50.680 --> 24:52.045
I was gonna say stewardess.

24:53.480 --> 24:55.980
I'm sure you're aware someone
from the US Team Committee's

24:56.080 --> 24:57.809
coming here to check on Maggie's progress.

24:57.960 --> 25:00.220
She's their golden child. They love her.

25:00.320 --> 25:02.500
Yeah, she's gonna do
a bang-up job at trials.

25:02.600 --> 25:04.980
- When are trials?
- We're eight weeks out.

25:05.080 --> 25:08.084
As long as Maggie just does Maggie,
we're gonna be good.

25:11.360 --> 25:12.407
Excuse me.

25:13.280 --> 25:17.205
Did I say to do that?
I didn't realize how undisciplined you are.

25:17.440 --> 25:19.488
Shucks, sorry. I usually do that better.

25:19.640 --> 25:22.484
"Shucks"? Why don't you curse normal?

25:23.200 --> 25:24.611
Cursing hurts God's heart.

25:25.800 --> 25:27.086
So does being a showoff.

25:28.280 --> 25:31.140
Sorry. I was just really
excited to get back, you know.

25:31.240 --> 25:32.540
I want the all-around gold,

25:32.640 --> 25:34.340
- but bars are my specialty.
- Gold?

25:34.440 --> 25:35.601
Did she just say "gold"?

25:36.160 --> 25:38.049
Get that ego in check.

25:38.440 --> 25:41.444
You're not a specialist until I say you are.

25:42.280 --> 25:45.363
Now, what needs to be the strongest
for you to be a champion?

25:45.640 --> 25:47.244
- My body.
- Wrong.

25:47.560 --> 25:48.641
My endurance.

25:49.560 --> 25:50.641
My...

25:51.720 --> 25:53.051
My mental constitution?

25:54.880 --> 25:56.962
- Your mind.
- But I said my mental...

25:57.120 --> 25:59.646
Shut up and lie on the floor.
Wipe that smile off your face.

26:00.480 --> 26:02.084
Now, close your eyes.

26:07.320 --> 26:09.700
Are we praying?
I love that. Let's hold hands.

26:09.800 --> 26:11.290
Get the fuck off.

26:12.160 --> 26:14.367
Close your fucking eyes.

26:14.920 --> 26:18.891
Now, I want you to visualize
your routine in your mind.

26:20.040 --> 26:22.691
- Which one?
- All of them. Just do it.

26:23.920 --> 26:27.163
- And then am I gonna perform them for you?
- Are you the coach, or am I?

26:27.720 --> 26:29.131
Shut your cockhole.

26:29.320 --> 26:30.924
- My what?
- Don't worry about it.

26:32.160 --> 26:35.060
Buzz off, Twitchy.
I feel you trying to get a gap shot.

26:35.160 --> 26:36.161
Nope.

26:45.120 --> 26:48.100
Hey, can we work on my beam routine
when we get to the gym?

26:48.200 --> 26:52.020
It's my fave, and I've been telling my mom
how excited I am to show you.

26:52.120 --> 26:53.940
Stop telling your mom our business.

26:54.040 --> 26:57.020
Whatever happens at the gym or my car
or wherever we are together

26:57.120 --> 26:59.820
stays at the gym
or my car or wherever we are together.

26:59.920 --> 27:00.967
Really?

27:01.560 --> 27:03.801
- Coach P was not like...
- Hey!

27:04.120 --> 27:06.521
You crap on this town, I crap on you.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.327
And, yes, really.
I'm not running home and telling my dad

27:10.440 --> 27:13.205
- every time you get camel toe.
- What's camel toe?

27:13.560 --> 27:15.210
Just a pro term for sticking a landing.

27:15.920 --> 27:17.365
Here you go.

27:18.640 --> 27:19.971
Thank you.

27:22.760 --> 27:24.250
This is a joke, right?

27:26.880 --> 27:30.009
Michael Phelps eats 12,000 calories a day.

27:30.240 --> 27:33.801
Coach P's diet has 500.
Who's a better role model?

27:33.920 --> 27:36.924
A guy with 22 medals?
Or a chubby Russian taking a dirt nap?

27:37.960 --> 27:40.247
But aren't guy swimmers
different than girl gymnasts?

27:41.840 --> 27:45.162
Casey B. Anthony told us
that men and women are equal.

27:45.640 --> 27:47.642
You mean Susan B. Anthony, right?

27:48.960 --> 27:50.200
Both of 'em.

27:50.600 --> 27:54.366
Maggie, if you trust me,
you will eat this food.

27:58.800 --> 28:00.768
Open your mouth and put it in.

28:06.840 --> 28:10.401
Hey, there's my favorite Sandstoner.

28:11.160 --> 28:12.241
Who's that?

28:14.680 --> 28:16.523
- You fuck him?
- No.

28:17.200 --> 28:19.441
No, of course not. No.

28:19.840 --> 28:21.001
- Finger fuck?
- No.

28:21.160 --> 28:22.605
Have you even kissed a boy yet?

28:24.440 --> 28:26.169
Coach P's no-boy rule?

28:28.640 --> 28:30.642
I have the opposite rule.

28:32.040 --> 28:34.520
Come on. Come on.

28:34.720 --> 28:36.210
- Get the fuck up. Get the fuck up.
- No.

28:36.960 --> 28:39.122
Get the fuck up, I'll rip your pubes out.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.490
- Hey.
- Hi.

28:42.840 --> 28:44.860
I'm gonna cut through the bullshit.
You two need to hook up.

28:44.960 --> 28:46.620
Nothing major yet.
Just rub your privates on each other

28:46.720 --> 28:49.007
- like you're starting a forest crotch fire.
- Gosh.

28:49.120 --> 28:50.100
Privates.

28:50.200 --> 28:51.820
Give him your number,
give him your number.

28:51.920 --> 28:53.001
Okay.

28:55.160 --> 28:56.810
He's a little slow?

28:57.640 --> 29:00.689
- All right, done. You're welcome. Come on.
- Bye-bye.

29:03.760 --> 29:04.761
Eat.

29:05.160 --> 29:06.620
Take a bite of that.

29:06.720 --> 29:09.963
Your body metabolizes the proteins.
You become a champion.

29:10.320 --> 29:13.130
- It's so good.
- It goes down better with Avril.

29:55.600 --> 29:58.570
Morning, sunshine.
Making yourself a health shake?

29:58.880 --> 30:02.123
It's for Maggie. Today's an important day,
the coordinator's coming by.

30:02.800 --> 30:04.723
She needs to be on her A-game.

30:07.240 --> 30:09.004
Good for you, sweetie.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.561
- Are we gonna be late?
- Relax.

30:32.120 --> 30:34.600
- What's up?
- What are you doing here?

30:36.160 --> 30:37.900
What is he doing here?

30:38.000 --> 30:40.924
Bad news, sugar tits.
Gotta get used to a crowd.

30:41.240 --> 30:43.925
I want that down the hatch
before we get to the gym.

31:03.440 --> 31:04.646
Hey, Hope.

31:05.520 --> 31:08.100
What happened to 8:00 a.m.?
The coordinator is here

31:08.200 --> 31:11.700
and he's kind of pissed
'cause he's been waiting for an hour.

31:11.800 --> 31:14.020
It's 9:00. There's a grace period.

31:14.120 --> 31:15.849
Okay. Sure.

31:17.440 --> 31:19.169
Hey, there, Maggie.

31:20.960 --> 31:22.380
Is everything okay?

31:22.480 --> 31:25.051
She's a little nervous and all that.
Come on, Maggie.

31:25.840 --> 31:28.969
- Yeah, she's just practicing the visualization.
- There she is.

31:29.120 --> 31:30.406
Come on.

31:32.800 --> 31:34.006
Hey.

31:34.240 --> 31:36.686
- Moral support. Let's go.
- Hi, there.

31:37.040 --> 31:38.780
Dude, I'm tired of fucking whey protein.

31:38.880 --> 31:41.460
Just get the beef one like I told you.
It's called Carnivore.

31:41.560 --> 31:43.005
He's back there in the office.

31:43.160 --> 31:45.128
All right, call me later.

31:48.520 --> 31:49.646
Look who I found.

31:49.840 --> 31:53.322
Well, well, well. Hope Ann Greggory.

31:54.480 --> 31:55.845
You're an hour and three minutes late.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.580
What the fuck are you doing here,
Lance Tucker?

31:57.680 --> 31:58.620
You guys know each other.

31:58.720 --> 32:00.210
Team coordinator.

32:01.440 --> 32:03.647
They offered me that job.
I said, "Fuck, no."

32:04.680 --> 32:07.684
- That's bullshit.
- Your face is bullshit.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.241
Something looks different about you.

32:11.080 --> 32:13.140
I know. You got old.

32:13.240 --> 32:15.686
Your limp dick disease
must be affecting your eye vision.

32:15.840 --> 32:20.289
Okay. Hope, what's Maggie's first event?
I'll set it up.

32:20.440 --> 32:21.780
- Bars.
- Gotcha.

32:21.880 --> 32:23.962
Hey, water boy, I can't drink
that bottle of piss you gave me.

32:24.080 --> 32:25.081
Here's five bucks.

32:25.240 --> 32:27.720
Why don't you get me a Fiji,
or something pH balanced?

32:27.920 --> 32:29.684
And if you're lucky,
I'll let you taste my nuts.

32:30.040 --> 32:32.300
Hope's tasted my nuts before, right?

32:32.400 --> 32:33.890
Do not get that water, Twitchy.

32:36.920 --> 32:38.940
- Are you winking at me?
- No.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.940
What, are we flirting right now?
What's happening?

32:41.040 --> 32:43.620
Hey! Don't make fun of people
with deformity problems.

32:43.720 --> 32:46.100
I'm actually not deformed.
But it's not a problem.

32:46.200 --> 32:49.204
I'll go get the water, pH balanced, for men.

32:58.720 --> 33:01.405
- Boost me.
- Maggie, no, I can't do that.

33:01.880 --> 33:04.565
Fine. Then a rocket ship will take me.

33:16.680 --> 33:17.841
Do you see me, Hope?

33:30.760 --> 33:33.127
Thanks, Maggie. I think I've seen enough.

33:35.600 --> 33:37.762
- I think my camel toe's a little off.
- Excuse me?

33:37.960 --> 33:39.530
She's a bit of a perv.

33:40.640 --> 33:44.531
- Hope, office. Now.
- Office, now, Hope!

33:45.960 --> 33:47.291
Horrible, right?

33:48.280 --> 33:52.126
I did my best, but obviously,
Maggie's campaign is over.

33:52.280 --> 33:53.691
Will you be informing the media or should I?

33:53.880 --> 33:55.644
What the fuck have you done?

33:55.960 --> 33:58.884
That girl didn't miss a beat all year.
She was a potential team anchor.

33:59.200 --> 34:00.531
Clearly, that would be a terrible idea.

34:00.720 --> 34:04.645
No, clearly you've managed to fuck her up
in just six weeks of working with her.

34:05.840 --> 34:08.286
What has she been eating?
The kid's got a beer gut.

34:08.840 --> 34:10.020
She was busted when I got her.

34:10.120 --> 34:12.420
Pavleck's suicide fucked her up.
I had nothing to do with it.

34:12.520 --> 34:13.851
No, you're right. You've done enough.

34:16.320 --> 34:17.731
I'm gonna take it over from here.

34:17.880 --> 34:22.408
I know what that girl is capable of,
and her run to Toronto isn't over.

34:22.960 --> 34:24.166
Yours is.

34:24.560 --> 34:25.846
No, you can't do that!

34:26.040 --> 34:29.168
I gotta make some calls, Greggory. I'll BRB.

34:30.159 --> 34:32.322
Yeah, well,
I gotta make some calls, too, Tucker.

34:35.480 --> 34:37.801
I'm gonna talk to your mom. I got you.

34:39.080 --> 34:40.161
Okay.

34:44.239 --> 34:45.659
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

34:45.760 --> 34:47.330
Guess who the new team coordinatoris.

34:47.520 --> 34:49.362
- Lance "The Fucker" Tucker.
- Who?

34:49.679 --> 34:50.841
The guy who popped my cherry.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.500
Don't give him that power, honey.

34:52.600 --> 34:55.842
Remember, you're a gymnast and
your hymen broke without the help of a man.

34:56.159 --> 34:57.820
Fine. The one who was the first to fuck me.

34:57.920 --> 34:59.300
He said he's gonna
take Maggie away from me

34:59.400 --> 35:01.004
'cause the little cunt blew her routine.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.567
No. What? Why did she blow her routine?

35:03.880 --> 35:06.360
Because she sucks!
I gotta ask you something.

35:06.480 --> 35:08.740
If someone takes over coaching for me,
I'll still get my money, right?

35:08.840 --> 35:11.620
No. When I spoke to the will trustee
last week, he was very clear.

35:11.720 --> 35:14.140
He said you, and only you, must coach her

35:14.240 --> 35:17.528
until she's done with her campaign
if you want the inheritance.

35:17.680 --> 35:18.886
Shit.

35:20.720 --> 35:22.927
Well, what percent of my money
will I get for my work until now?

35:23.080 --> 35:25.367
Do you remember our math sessions
when we did percentages?

35:25.600 --> 35:27.284
Yes. How much frickin' money?

35:28.120 --> 35:30.805
- 0%.
- Shit. How sure are you?

35:31.240 --> 35:32.571
100%.

35:32.960 --> 35:34.940
- 0% is how much money?
- Nothing.

35:35.040 --> 35:36.041
Fuck me!

35:39.120 --> 35:42.966
- What are you doing?
- Visualizing a gold medal made of pizza.

35:44.320 --> 35:45.900
I got it, I got it.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.300
I went to five different stores,
but I got it.

35:47.400 --> 35:48.380
Where the fuck is Lance?

35:48.480 --> 35:49.460
He's not here?

35:49.560 --> 35:52.040
Lance said
he was gonna go talk to my mommy.

35:52.760 --> 35:56.526
Get up. Get your bloated pussy in the car!

35:57.080 --> 36:00.243
Are you gonna see Lance?
Do you want to give him the water?

36:02.320 --> 36:04.740
- Gymnastics has been my life.
- Yeah. It's ours.

36:04.840 --> 36:07.380
And when I saw raw talent like that,
I believed...

36:07.480 --> 36:09.369
Jesus. Is that safe?

36:10.680 --> 36:14.127
- Mom!
- Maggie. Hi, hon.

36:15.920 --> 36:17.900
Oh, my gosh, are you okay?

36:18.000 --> 36:20.540
Mr. Tucker says
you didn't have the best routine

36:20.640 --> 36:23.500
and that you've been acting silly
and eating bad snacks.

36:23.600 --> 36:26.285
- That doesn't sound like you.
- I just had a little taste.

36:27.840 --> 36:31.526
Mr. Tucker thinks that Maggie would be
better off training with him.

36:31.680 --> 36:33.284
- I do.
- Wait, what?

36:33.640 --> 36:35.369
Well, Mr. Tucker is wrong.

36:35.760 --> 36:38.060
- I want what's best for my little girl.
- I agree.

36:38.160 --> 36:40.162
Lance Tucker is not what's best for her.

36:40.360 --> 36:42.328
I am a gold and silver medalist.

36:42.600 --> 36:44.780
And with all due respect,
and there's very little due,

36:44.880 --> 36:46.041
Hope is a bronze medalist.

36:46.320 --> 36:50.530
First of all, it's men's gymnastics,
which, come on, no one gives a crap about.

36:50.840 --> 36:55.482
Second, I medaled for all of America.
I'm the poster child for miracles.

36:55.640 --> 36:59.008
Please, everybody knows that
after your Achilles, it was game over.

36:59.320 --> 37:03.380
And insult to injury, you got your boobs,
which threw your balance off.

37:03.480 --> 37:05.220
All false. Does it look like I got boobs?

37:05.320 --> 37:06.660
I just didn't want to,
I had other things to do.

37:06.760 --> 37:07.700
Well, name one.

37:07.800 --> 37:09.460
Why would I name one
when I can name a million?

37:09.560 --> 37:11.244
Guys. Please, I'm sorry. I just...

37:11.520 --> 37:13.420
Maggie. Maggie, look at me.

37:13.520 --> 37:15.460
You've met my girl, Christa Carpenter,
at the World's, right?

37:15.560 --> 37:16.641
Yeah.

37:16.760 --> 37:20.970
Well, when the time is right, I'm gonna
build her an empire all around her brand.

37:21.640 --> 37:25.220
I Ka-roll-yi like Bela.
I'm her agent, her publicist, her coach.

37:25.320 --> 37:28.961
I'm her cook.
I am the pillow that she sleeps on at night.

37:29.480 --> 37:31.847
Gold. That is what I'm talking about.

37:32.040 --> 37:34.008
You just gotta say yes. What do you say?

37:36.880 --> 37:38.086
To the top.

37:43.840 --> 37:45.046
Hope's my friend.

37:45.440 --> 37:49.843
And I already lost one coach.
Please don't take her from me, too. Don't.

37:50.520 --> 37:53.300
If you let Hope train Maggie,

37:53.400 --> 37:55.528
you'll be throwing your
daughter's career out the window.

37:55.880 --> 37:57.723
I promise you that won't be the case.

38:00.120 --> 38:01.884
- I've heard that before.
- You know,

38:02.200 --> 38:04.362
I lost my mother at a very young age.

38:04.600 --> 38:06.300
- I was five-and-a-half months old.
- I'm so sorry.

38:06.400 --> 38:11.201
Really? This is... Very sad.

38:12.560 --> 38:15.723
And I swear to you, on this mom,

38:17.720 --> 38:20.405
to this mom, that we will get to Toronto.

38:21.360 --> 38:24.728
Just let me initialize phase two of my plan.

38:28.240 --> 38:31.700
I hear what you're saying.
I have to go with my daughter.

38:31.800 --> 38:34.780
If that's what Maggie wants
and you think you can do it.

38:34.880 --> 38:37.087
- Hey, Janice, we need you back here.
- Frap.

38:37.280 --> 38:39.009
Okay, I'm sorry. I have to go back to work.

38:39.240 --> 38:42.130
- Go scrub them toilets, Mrs. T.
- I will.

38:42.480 --> 38:43.540
I'll do that, okay.

38:43.640 --> 38:45.220
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you.

38:45.320 --> 38:47.448
All right, let's go. Later, Tucker.

38:47.600 --> 38:49.602
Yeah, hang on there one second.

38:49.800 --> 38:51.460
Maggie, go to the car.

38:51.560 --> 38:53.927
You can put on my Avril Lavigne CD.

38:55.280 --> 38:58.180
You know you don't have
what it takes to coach her, right?

38:58.280 --> 39:01.443
- You don't know me. You never have.
- Really?

39:02.480 --> 39:05.404
We all know you're gonna fail her
like you failed yourself.

39:10.960 --> 39:14.407
Not only will she kill it at the trials,
she'll kill it in Toronto.

39:14.760 --> 39:15.761
We'll see.

39:23.200 --> 39:25.168
- No. Get out!
- What?

39:25.280 --> 39:27.282
No-boy rule. That's it. Get the fuck out.

39:30.320 --> 39:33.529
You'll see her in six months.
Absence makes the dick grow harder.

39:33.720 --> 39:35.848
Maggie, get up here. Get up here, now.

39:36.160 --> 39:38.811
Hope, I was just doing what you said.

39:40.000 --> 39:44.289
You better get ready to stop acting like
a loser and start acting like a champion.

39:45.440 --> 39:48.171
You better not have gotten
any clit jizz on my car.

39:54.600 --> 39:56.740
What's with you today, Bradley?

39:56.840 --> 40:00.208
You're jittery. You're all over the place.
Anything wrong?

40:00.440 --> 40:01.930
Soon as I ask...

40:02.600 --> 40:05.649
Hi, sweetie. How'd things work out?

40:06.480 --> 40:08.448
Fine. Still her coach.

40:09.160 --> 40:11.208
What happened with that Lance?

40:12.440 --> 40:14.283
So many questions.

40:15.240 --> 40:19.450
How would you like it if I came home
and fired questions at you after a long day?

40:20.160 --> 40:22.220
"Hey, Stanny. How was your mail route?

40:22.320 --> 40:25.244
"Anything happen
when you drop off your letters?

40:25.360 --> 40:28.380
"Did you jerk it in your truck
to a Lane Bryant catalog?

40:28.480 --> 40:30.050
"That must be fun."

40:30.160 --> 40:34.300
I would actually like it if you asked me
questions about my day once in a while.

40:34.400 --> 40:35.580
Maybe not in that tone.

40:35.680 --> 40:38.445
Fine, here's a question.
Wake me up tomorrow at 6:00 a.m.

40:38.680 --> 40:41.180
Well, Hopey, that's a statement.

40:41.280 --> 40:44.580
Remember, questions begin
with "what, why, when, how."

40:44.680 --> 40:46.140
Like that. Do you remember?

40:46.240 --> 40:48.527
What is the point of you busting my balls?

40:49.040 --> 40:52.522
When will you realize
that goldfish doesn't know you exist?

40:52.880 --> 40:55.020
Why don't you stop being
so fucking annoying?

40:55.120 --> 40:57.726
And how about you wake me up tomorrow
at 6:00 a.m.?

40:57.880 --> 41:00.020
Bradley knows exactly who I am.

41:00.120 --> 41:03.203
And I will wake you up,
but only if you ask me nicely.

41:03.720 --> 41:04.820
I am.

41:04.920 --> 41:08.083
Just whatever I say or do, ignore it,
and wake me up.

41:08.400 --> 41:10.926
Roger that. Just like old times.

41:12.920 --> 41:15.161
Hope, it's 6:00.

41:17.400 --> 41:18.925
Rise and shine.

41:29.120 --> 41:30.724
Go. You got five minutes.

41:31.160 --> 41:33.447
Before 7:00? I'm sorry, have we met?

41:33.960 --> 41:35.564
Early bird catches the sperm.

41:35.960 --> 41:38.406
I got a fuck-ton of stuff to do.

41:38.840 --> 41:40.888
And I think you're ready
to be promoted from stewardess.

41:41.840 --> 41:43.922
- Co-pilot?
- Head stewardess.

41:44.160 --> 41:46.162
Great, okay. Moving on up.

41:51.600 --> 41:53.921
- Scale of one to 10, that was a...
- Yeah.

41:54.080 --> 41:56.540
When you're coming off your giant,
your tuck is getting sloppy

41:56.640 --> 41:57.641
and your legs are separating.

41:58.080 --> 41:59.820
Unless you're catching
spinning air dicks in there,

41:59.920 --> 42:01.763
I want you to keep 'em closed.

42:02.040 --> 42:03.690
Let me show you something.

42:06.120 --> 42:08.202
Foot in there. Foot in there.

42:08.760 --> 42:09.761
I've never done this.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.321
All right. Again. Same thing.

42:13.360 --> 42:14.361
Yep.

42:17.800 --> 42:19.780
She's liking this bondage shit
a little too much.

42:19.880 --> 42:21.006
All right. Go again.

42:22.960 --> 42:24.121
Stay tight!

42:29.320 --> 42:31.209
Now that's fucking gymnastics.

42:31.480 --> 42:32.561
Go again.

42:41.160 --> 42:43.481
Shouldn't we be using
my Tchaikovsky piece to practice?

42:43.640 --> 42:46.405
- Fuck no, that shit's lame.
- Coach P said it was a classic.

42:46.640 --> 42:49.166
She'd also say that about a full bush,
but we all know that's disgusting.

42:49.440 --> 42:50.566
Let's go.

42:51.360 --> 42:53.567
Five, six, seven, eight.

42:53.840 --> 42:57.845
Crossback, crossback, circle, bend.
Step, corner.

43:01.360 --> 43:03.044
Don't hesitate in your double pike, Maggie.

43:03.240 --> 43:05.004
Trust that you're gonna have
enough momentum.

43:05.880 --> 43:09.089
Every part of you needs to be focused
on the task at hand.

43:09.280 --> 43:11.965
Crossback, circle, bend, step, corner.

43:12.680 --> 43:13.806
Good.

43:14.480 --> 43:15.686
There you go.

43:15.880 --> 43:19.043
- Holla!
- Gloats get kicked in the throats. Go.

43:20.200 --> 43:21.281
Hey, good job, Coach.

43:28.400 --> 43:29.526
Hope?

43:31.360 --> 43:33.567
I'm really nervous about the trials.

43:35.560 --> 43:38.769
Well, that's both rude and offensive,

43:38.960 --> 43:41.611
considering I've been
busting my ass for you.

43:43.200 --> 43:44.725
Sorry, you're right.

43:45.880 --> 43:47.041
You'll be fine.

43:48.040 --> 43:51.100
I just wish my mom could be there.

43:51.200 --> 43:53.540
You don't need your mommy.

43:53.640 --> 43:56.540
I mean, for the Games, yeah,
it's nice to have support.

43:56.640 --> 43:59.041
But even my dad
wasn't with me for the trials.

43:59.880 --> 44:04.886
Plus, I'll be there with you,
so people will already assume you're cool.

44:06.640 --> 44:07.971
What do cool people do?

44:09.840 --> 44:11.649
They have a secret handshake.

44:11.800 --> 44:13.700
Does that mean
we're gonna have a secret handshake?

44:13.800 --> 44:15.620
Fuck yeah, we are.

44:15.720 --> 44:19.008
The decision was decided
by me earlier today.

44:23.160 --> 44:24.924
Do it. Go.

44:25.280 --> 44:27.408
- No.
- Do it.

44:28.760 --> 44:29.841
Bye.

45:17.880 --> 45:20.645
Congratulations to our
Women's National Qualifiers.

45:21.320 --> 45:22.685
In first place, Christa Carpenter.

45:22.840 --> 45:25.411
Christa, how does it feel
to be the champion?

45:25.720 --> 45:27.802
Well, I just gotta thank God first.

45:28.720 --> 45:31.420
Never do that.
Always thank your coach first.

45:31.520 --> 45:32.806
Fucking rookie.

45:34.800 --> 45:36.484
I'm gonna call my mom, 'kay?

45:37.200 --> 45:40.420
The smell of mothballs and Poligrip.

45:40.520 --> 45:42.340
My grandma must be here.

45:42.440 --> 45:45.900
Nope. It's the elderly musk
of Hope Ann Greggory.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.685
What you're smelling,
cheese dick, is victory.

45:49.240 --> 45:52.260
- We medaled.
- Yeah, third. Isn't that familiar?

45:52.360 --> 45:54.740
So, here's what's gonna happen, Granny.

45:54.840 --> 45:57.660
Maggie's gonna come train with me
and the rest of the team starting Monday.

45:57.760 --> 46:00.240
Not gonna happen, coordinator.

46:00.360 --> 46:03.170
You don't follow Tuckersgold on Twitter?

46:03.280 --> 46:07.604
I was just appointed
Women's Team Head Coach yesterday,

46:08.520 --> 46:10.363
so what I say goes.

46:10.880 --> 46:13.140
And if Maggie doesn't train with my girls,

46:13.240 --> 46:15.208
then there's no way
she's gonna be a legit contender.

46:15.440 --> 46:16.441
Bullshit.

46:16.720 --> 46:19.405
I'm gonna cut her from the team
if you don't comply, Hope.

46:19.520 --> 46:21.860
She just placed in the top three.

46:21.960 --> 46:25.043
If you cut her, you're gonna look like
more of a moron than you already do.

46:25.200 --> 46:28.488
Here's a warning.
You don't want to fuck with me, Hope.

46:30.600 --> 46:33.660
I'll fuck with whoever I want,
whenever I want.

46:33.760 --> 46:36.889
I'll fuck with them so hard,
I'll rip their taints in half.

46:37.440 --> 46:40.860
Then I'll wear one part of the taint
in a locket around my neck,

46:40.960 --> 46:44.980
give the other half of the taint locket
to your mom to shove up her ass.

46:45.080 --> 46:47.620
Pretty soon after,
at the whorehouse she whores around at,

46:47.720 --> 46:50.460
someone will say to her,
"Hey, hey, Mrs. Tucker,

46:50.560 --> 46:52.961
"what's that shiny little object
coming out of your crack?"

46:53.080 --> 46:56.482
And she'll be like, "This ass jewelry?
Just spit-shined it up.

46:56.800 --> 47:01.567
"Hope Ann Greggory gave me that
as a reminder that my son's a fucking loser."

47:02.440 --> 47:05.410
Maggie trains with me. See you in Toronto.

47:09.760 --> 47:10.966
No! No!

47:11.080 --> 47:13.300
Fuck! Fuck me, I suck! Fuck!

47:13.400 --> 47:16.051
Time out, time out. Stand right there.

47:18.080 --> 47:21.926
First of all, it makes me so proud
to hear you curse normal.

47:22.760 --> 47:26.810
Second, quit being so hard on yourself.
All right? That's my job.

47:27.520 --> 47:29.045
I want to shift gears.

47:29.960 --> 47:32.486
I want to talk to you
about your stage presence.

47:32.600 --> 47:34.364
You need to amp that shit up for Toronto.

47:35.280 --> 47:39.968
You're welcome in advance.
I'm gonna show you how to be judge bait.

47:41.280 --> 47:43.660
- Judge bait?
- A trained monkey can do gymnastics.

47:43.760 --> 47:46.809
Half of what we do out there is personality.
Sit, watch, learn.

47:47.360 --> 47:48.521
When you hit this move,

47:49.080 --> 47:52.163
your face needs to be having
as much fun as your body.

47:52.640 --> 47:54.881
This move is all about sass.

47:55.280 --> 47:59.330
Now we're bouncing, we're bouncing.
I've never had this much fun bouncing.

47:59.880 --> 48:02.326
You think this is funny?
This is some serious shit.

48:02.560 --> 48:04.580
The judges are scoring me
through the roof right now.

48:04.680 --> 48:07.809
The camera's dry humping my every move.
All right. Do it with me.

48:08.800 --> 48:09.926
Come on.

48:11.800 --> 48:13.768
I am so cute.

48:14.000 --> 48:15.809
Cute to the right, cute to the left.

48:15.960 --> 48:17.460
Nod, I'm cute. Nod, I'm cute.

48:17.560 --> 48:19.620
- Nod, I'm cute. Nod, I'm cute.
- Jesus, pull it back.

48:19.720 --> 48:20.780
Sell it, don't advertise it.

48:20.880 --> 48:25.090
Commercials, endorsements,
a fuck-ton of free shit. Get up!

48:27.200 --> 48:28.645
Sell it to the bitch-ass judges.

48:30.920 --> 48:32.365
Do it again. Go.

48:42.520 --> 48:44.329
You guys, I got a spare!

48:45.400 --> 48:46.845
Very good.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.340
You know, Coach P would take me here
when I was doing good at the gym.

48:49.440 --> 48:51.602
Does that mean
I'm doing good at the gym, Hope?

48:52.400 --> 48:54.004
I just wanted nachos.

48:55.520 --> 48:57.363
- Can I just have one?
- Sure.

48:58.560 --> 49:00.180
If you want to spend
your summer in fat camp

49:00.280 --> 49:03.409
rather than earning the respect
of the entire frickin' world.

49:05.920 --> 49:06.921
What I thought.

49:07.520 --> 49:08.567
Here.

49:09.720 --> 49:13.088
Chomp on that while you smell my nachos.

49:18.120 --> 49:22.364
- Okay. Yeah, that kind of works. Thank you.
- Yeah.

49:23.200 --> 49:25.328
You can do it with anything
that has a smell.

49:25.440 --> 49:27.886
Can I go play on the claw machine? Please?

49:28.400 --> 49:29.845
It's a free country.

49:30.240 --> 49:31.446
Thank you.

49:33.080 --> 49:34.684
Pretty strict diet.

49:35.880 --> 49:37.220
That's nothing.

49:37.320 --> 49:40.140
I once ate nothing
but watermelon juice for a month.

49:40.240 --> 49:42.447
I had to reteach my jaw how to chew.

49:43.760 --> 49:45.762
- This machine is stupid.
- Try again.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.890
You guys, I can't do this.
I'm really bad at this.

49:52.840 --> 49:54.808
Here, let me do it. Move.

49:56.760 --> 50:00.162
It's all in the wrist. There you go.

50:00.440 --> 50:03.922
Oh, my gosh! That was so cool!
You actually got it!

50:04.120 --> 50:05.485
Oh, my gosh.

50:08.840 --> 50:10.410
It's so cute.

50:12.480 --> 50:16.929
I can have it? Thank you!
Thank you so much!

50:18.760 --> 50:22.242
Ben, Ben, look what Hope got me!

50:23.880 --> 50:25.166
That was very kind of you.

50:25.840 --> 50:29.322
She was just setting herself up for failure.
As per usual.

50:30.960 --> 50:34.009
Hey, are you free tonight?

50:34.960 --> 50:37.611
My schedule is insane. Also per usual.

50:41.520 --> 50:42.646
Why?

50:45.640 --> 50:47.847
Would you want to grab dinner, maybe?

50:53.560 --> 50:56.962
Yeah. I can probably
push some things around.

50:57.160 --> 50:59.322
Okay. Good news.

51:01.720 --> 51:03.882
I'll pick you up and everything.

51:04.120 --> 51:06.771
- I'm clear to drive even at night, so...
- Really?

51:07.040 --> 51:08.246
Yeah. This isn't an issue.

51:08.480 --> 51:10.540
You won't run us off the road?

51:10.640 --> 51:12.642
- Not on my watch.
- All right.

51:13.640 --> 51:15.005
That was a joke, so...

51:15.560 --> 51:18.484
That's not a joke, that's actually real.
I'm having a fit, I'm sorry.

51:19.480 --> 51:21.323
- Hold on.
- I'll look away.

51:23.160 --> 51:26.164
- Have at it. Go ahead.
- No, I'm fine. I'm good. Shit.

51:28.840 --> 51:31.740
Welcome home, sweetie.
I made your favorite.

51:31.840 --> 51:35.060
Chicken fingers
with White Castle burger stuffing.

51:35.160 --> 51:38.721
I won't be taking my dinner here tonight.
I got a date.

51:39.200 --> 51:40.565
That's fantastic.

51:40.800 --> 51:43.451
You're gonna change
out of your warm-up suit, right?

51:43.720 --> 51:46.371
No. This is what I wear.

51:46.880 --> 51:49.201
- This is what heroes wear.
- That's true.

51:49.360 --> 51:53.524
But you may want to, I don't know,
mix it up a little?

51:53.920 --> 51:58.050
I'm not taking fashion advice from a guy
who wears blue shorts for a living.

52:01.880 --> 52:03.882
Your Honor,
I have the sext right here on my phone.

52:10.560 --> 52:12.528
Well, look at you.

52:12.920 --> 52:16.129
- Have a good time tonight, honey.
- Stop pressuring me!

52:17.080 --> 52:19.890
Hey, Hope. You look great.

52:21.080 --> 52:22.460
I'm sorry, I was gonna come inside.

52:22.560 --> 52:24.820
Why? You need to take a leak?

52:24.920 --> 52:27.890
No, no. I was just trying to be a gentleman.

52:31.400 --> 52:34.460
So, I know
that your two favorite places to eat

52:34.560 --> 52:37.131
are the diner and the food court.

52:37.520 --> 52:39.180
But, you know,
since we've been to the diner a lot,

52:39.280 --> 52:42.045
I figured that maybe
I'd take you to the mall.

52:42.560 --> 52:44.722
It's Sunday. The mall closes at 6:00.

52:44.920 --> 52:47.082
Well, don't you worry about that.

52:47.600 --> 52:50.080
- Why are you being weird?
- Sorry if I was weird.

52:50.760 --> 52:52.780
All right, well, just step on it.

52:52.880 --> 52:55.247
I feel my dad watching from the window
with stuffing in his mouth.

53:03.760 --> 53:04.761
All right.

53:05.720 --> 53:07.609
- Okay. Let's go.
- Jesus!

53:09.120 --> 53:11.441
- What are you doing?
- Isn't that what this is about?

53:11.640 --> 53:14.564
- You want to fuck a gymnast?
- No.

53:21.360 --> 53:22.407
Why?

53:22.960 --> 53:24.928
I'm waiting for marriage.

53:25.960 --> 53:29.601
Just how I was raised. That's all.

53:30.560 --> 53:31.561
But here.

53:38.280 --> 53:40.248
Yeah. So, grab one of those.

53:49.120 --> 53:50.485
Weird being in here at night.

53:51.120 --> 53:53.600
Yeah. Any table you like.

54:07.680 --> 54:09.409
A little picnic.

54:12.920 --> 54:14.365
- Knock yourself out, bro.
- Thanks.

54:14.480 --> 54:15.527
- Hi, Hope.
- Hi, John.

54:15.680 --> 54:16.681
Hey, Johnny.

54:18.280 --> 54:19.361
What's that smell?

54:23.000 --> 54:24.161
Is something wrong with the candle?

54:24.400 --> 54:27.860
No, it's weird that they'd make a candle
out of apples, like...

54:27.960 --> 54:28.980
I thought apple was safe.

54:29.080 --> 54:31.140
I mean, I haven't met a single person
that doesn't like apples.

54:31.240 --> 54:33.083
A lot of people don't like apples.

54:33.720 --> 54:36.326
- Sorry...
- No, no, no. It's fine.

54:37.240 --> 54:40.961
All right.
I got a couple beers here. Let me...

54:43.320 --> 54:44.560
Want to cheers it?

54:45.440 --> 54:46.885
There you go.

54:51.720 --> 54:54.007
Sorry, I should have thought of
some entertainment or something.

54:55.720 --> 54:57.006
No, it's...

55:00.640 --> 55:02.529
Do you want to play Truth or Dare?

55:03.040 --> 55:05.042
Yeah, sure. Okay.

55:06.040 --> 55:07.405
Truth or dare?

55:08.520 --> 55:11.683
What the heck, I'm feeling crazy tonight.
Dare. Dare me.

55:14.520 --> 55:17.251
Steal me a punch card from Steak USA.

55:17.760 --> 55:19.683
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

55:21.080 --> 55:22.241
Yeah.

55:23.920 --> 55:26.140
Kind of have to do it now.
That's how it works.

55:26.240 --> 55:29.323
Yeah. Yeah, here we go. Dare time.
Watch out.

55:36.400 --> 55:39.020
- Found 'em!
- Punch 'em all out so I get a free steak.

55:39.120 --> 55:40.360
Yeah, sure.

55:43.440 --> 55:44.601
Jesus.

55:46.120 --> 55:49.340
There you go. I'm shaking.

55:49.440 --> 55:51.500
That's like the worst thing
you've ever done, right?

55:51.600 --> 55:55.700
I mean, yeah. That's bad.
I mean, that's theft. Can't do that.

55:55.800 --> 55:58.326
Sorry. I should probably not...
Chip my tooth.

55:59.800 --> 56:02.610
So, my turn then to ask you?

56:03.440 --> 56:05.522
- Well, truth or dare?
- Dare.

56:05.720 --> 56:08.291
I dare you to answer the truth.

56:10.440 --> 56:11.885
- Fine.
- Okay.

56:13.640 --> 56:16.803
What's the deal with you and Coach P?

56:16.960 --> 56:20.248
'Cause I know before,
you guys were real tight.

56:21.680 --> 56:25.526
- We were. Till she screwed me.
- How's that?

56:29.600 --> 56:32.490
After my injury,
I wanted to compete in the next Games.

56:33.520 --> 56:35.860
The doctor said
I needed a few more months to recover,

56:35.960 --> 56:37.962
but I didn't want to get rusty.

56:38.160 --> 56:41.801
So, my dad went and begged Coach P
to let me come back.

56:42.320 --> 56:44.482
- And was she okay with that?
- No.

56:45.480 --> 56:48.370
But it wasn't her fucking future on the line,
it was mine.

56:48.480 --> 56:50.100
Right, yeah, I get that.

56:50.200 --> 56:53.090
Couple weeks later,
I'm doing a dismount off the bars.

56:54.640 --> 56:55.780
Hit the floor again.

56:55.880 --> 57:00.522
The doctors say six months more rehab,
but they're wrong. It's 12.

57:01.200 --> 57:03.646
- Geez, that's terrible.
- Is this lettuce?

57:05.000 --> 57:06.570
You don't like lettuce?

57:06.840 --> 57:10.083
I mean, I'm surprised
they don't have a candle made out of that.

57:11.040 --> 57:12.451
Lettuce candle?

57:15.400 --> 57:16.890
Hope Greggory.

57:18.200 --> 57:21.249
Anyway, when I came back,

57:22.320 --> 57:25.051
Coach P pulls me aside
and says I should leave on a high note.

57:26.000 --> 57:29.800
That I'd become a woman during my break,
and gymnastics was a little girl's game.

57:31.040 --> 57:32.326
I mean, what'd you say?

57:32.520 --> 57:34.045
I told her to fuck off and I left.

57:35.280 --> 57:37.567
Did you talk to her after that, or...

57:40.040 --> 57:42.008
I've answered, like, 900 truths.

57:42.240 --> 57:43.287
Sorry.

57:44.040 --> 57:46.460
- And it's not okay.
- I've been a real gumshoe over here.

57:46.560 --> 57:47.900
Yeah.

57:48.000 --> 57:49.889
And where were you the night of the... Yeah.

57:50.680 --> 57:52.060
- What?
- Sorry.

57:52.160 --> 57:53.969
It's like I was pretending to be
a detective or something.

57:59.040 --> 58:00.460
That's...

58:00.560 --> 58:03.460
This music was supposed to come on
when the candles were...

58:03.560 --> 58:05.403
It's fine now. Thanks, John!

58:06.640 --> 58:07.971
Actually,

58:10.400 --> 58:11.731
I was hoping maybe

58:13.080 --> 58:16.323
you would want to
have a dance with me, Hope Ann.

58:17.560 --> 58:19.210
You're not waiting for marriage?

58:19.760 --> 58:21.569
Nope. Not for dancing.

58:22.240 --> 58:23.924
In fact, I will lead.

58:24.920 --> 58:27.491
- All right. One more bite.
- Okay.

58:42.800 --> 58:44.131
Truth or dare?

58:44.280 --> 58:46.965
Truth. I've had enough dares for tonight.

58:47.640 --> 58:51.281
Have you ever tried to stop twitching?
No offense, just curious.

58:51.480 --> 58:53.005
It's a lot better than what it was.

58:53.240 --> 58:56.289
But, I mean,
nothing's ever worked completely.

58:56.800 --> 58:59.485
It's kind of why
I never moved forward with gymnastics.

58:59.960 --> 59:02.486
A few seconds of twitching
can really mess you up on the rings.

59:04.120 --> 59:08.284
Gymnasts, you somehow master
every single muscle in your body.

59:09.320 --> 59:11.900
Probably why I like being around it so much.

59:12.000 --> 59:16.289
Kind of makes me feel that that
physical control is possible somehow.

59:17.800 --> 59:22.283
I think it'd be pretty cool if I could
inspire other kids to feel like that, too.

59:22.480 --> 59:24.801
That's kind of why
I want to keep the gym going.

59:24.960 --> 59:27.042
It's sorta my dream.

59:27.480 --> 59:30.370
I'm just hoping
that Maggie can breathe new life into it

59:30.640 --> 59:33.166
the same way you did
when you were training there.

59:33.520 --> 59:34.646
Cool.

59:36.520 --> 59:39.330
Anyway, we should be dancing like this.

59:50.160 --> 59:51.730
Giving you a semi?

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:14.891
So, we leave for the Games in a few days.

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:20.090
Keeping Maggie presentation ready.

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:25.362
She's sucking less than she did.

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:32.609
Wish us luck, okay?

01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:38.410
One for my homey.

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:42.883
Don't worry, it's diet.

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:47.001
No, it's not. I'm not gonna lie to a ghost.
Definitely not diet.

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:48.965
Shit's disgusting.

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:59.460
All right, you got this. Let's call it a night.
Go on, go catch some fireworks.

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:01.700
Don't stay out too late,
we have an early flight.

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:02.980
Can I do it one more time?

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:04.969
Just stand here and I'm gonna
do it one more time, okay?

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:06.606
Make it quick.

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:16.209
Turn the fucking lights back on!
I'm not gonna French you!

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:19.244
- Maggie!
- One sec!

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:21.645
Surprise!

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:23.126
Happy birthday!

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:25.446
Gotcha!

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:27.486
We got you!

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:31.700
Okay, now, remember, Hope, before I ever
let you have a piece of birthday cake,

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:34.940
I always gave you a Fourth of July quiz.

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:36.121
Yeah.

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:37.660
All right, okay, I'll give you an easy one.

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:42.004
Who did our forefathers
declare their independence from?

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:43.891
Their pussy dads.

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:46.845
Good one.

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:51.291
Well, we're so grateful for you, Hope.
I mean, you've been an angel.

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:53.648
- That's what I keep telling her.
- Don't be a poser.

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:58.243
Well, pretty soon, you two are gonna be
posing for the opening ceremony!

01:01:58.360 --> 01:01:59.540
- Pretty exciting!
- Yeah.

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:02.120
And it kills me that
I'm not gonna be there, you know.

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:05.762
But I talked to my boss,
and I'm gonna be in time for the Individuals.

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:07.166
Well, that's terrific!

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:08.970
- That's all I care about.
- All right.

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:10.121
That's great.

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:18.048
- Truth or truth?
- Truth.

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:21.440
You like me?

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:26.766
I do. Very much.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.800
- Okay. My turn. Truth or truth?
- Truth.

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:38.125
But you can't ask me the same question.
Them the rules, Twitchy.

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:42.210
Did you always know that you were
gonna be such a good coach?

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:43.900
I'm not a coach, I'm an athlete.
Dumb question.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.684
- Ask me another.
- Sorry.

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:52.620
Is it true

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:56.281
that you tape down your breasts?

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:00.166
Who told you that?

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:02.169
- Matt from Sneaker Galaxy?
- No, no.

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:03.691
- Carl from the bar?
- No.

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:05.086
- Gas station Dan?
- No.

01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:06.401
- The Roto-Rooter guy?
- No.

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:09.484
- Stacy from Quiznos?
- Jesus, no, God, stop.

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:13.804
That's a list. No.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.369
I just... I brought it up
'cause I just wanted to tell you that

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:23.649
I think that you're super beautiful
the way you are.

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:26.561
And you don't need to do that.

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:29.331
You should be proud of yourself.

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:42.563
You look like a windswept phoenix.

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:47.041
Okay. You ready for a dare?

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:49.767
Sure.

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:51.524
All right, close your eyes.

01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:55.251
- Close 'em. Don't be scared.
- All right.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.401
Okay.

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:03.487
Okay.

01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:07.929
- You can't do that.
- I did.

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:36.445
Welcome to the big time.

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:39.060
Take a look around you. Chinese,

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:42.820
Japanese, Russian Soviets, Romaniacs.

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:46.700
- What do they all have in common?
- They all support gymnasts!

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:50.122
No. We've waged wars against all of them.

01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:53.364
- We have?
- And who's won all those wars?

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:56.260
Well, I guess it would depend on the war.

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:59.728
USA. USA.

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:01.684
- Chant that! USA!
- USA!

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:05.009
USA! USA!

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:08.490
USA! USA!

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:49.323
Painting the picture,
I'm sensing there's a podium in the future

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:50.885
for Mighty Maggie, Olga.

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:54.921
What is truly remarkable
is all that she's had to overcome

01:06:55.760 --> 01:07:00.800
following the tragic loss
of her longtime coach, Eleyna Pavleck.

01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:03.407
I think Coach P would be super proud of you.

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:05.604
We make a good team, co-pilot.

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:08.491
- Did I just get promoted?
- Don't get cocky.

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:15.289
You gotta a little...

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.641
Sorry, I didn't ask permission.
I know how you hate that mushy stuff.

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:23.686
It's not that.

01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:29.122
I still don't get
why the Commie killed herself.

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:32.285
Sometimes I think

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:37.169
if I'd just done things differently,
maybe she'd still be alive.

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:40.327
No, come on, Hope,
it's got nothing to do with you.

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:41.647
Then why?

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:45.540
Honestly, I think
it was 'cause of her drinking.

01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:50.380
I mean, she'd really throw 'em back there.
That, and she was flat broke.

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:54.644
I mean, her house was being foreclosed on.
I mean, she was in a ton of debt.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.260
Didn't she co-own the gym with your dad?
Where'd that money go?

01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:02.260
I didn't want to distract you with this,

01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:04.522
- but the gym's pretty much going under.
- What?

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:07.406
So, Coach P had no money,
like, stashed somewhere?

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:09.284
Like, $500,000, maybe?

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:13.620
- Hope, that's like half a million dollars.
- I know.

01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:17.691
Well, my dad said that she was
actually in debt to the government.

01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:19.531
She had nothing.

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:26.685
Bradley, I'd let you swim in the pool,
but I think the chlorine content's too high.

01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:31.260
Hi, honey. We were just going for a swim.

01:08:31.359 --> 01:08:34.886
What the fuck is going on?
You need to call that will trustee guy now!

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:37.167
Ben just said that Coach P was flat broke!

01:08:37.399 --> 01:08:39.163
He's wrong, right?
She must have had some money

01:08:39.319 --> 01:08:42.005
in, like, some offshore Florida accounts,
or some shit!

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:45.484
Well, honey, it's after 5:00.
I doubt he's there now.

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:46.886
Call him anyway!

01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:49.880
What's his name?

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:53.962
What's his name?

01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:57.002
Hope,

01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:00.923
there's something I need to talk
to you about. Can you sit down?

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:03.361
I don't want to sit down. What?

01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:17.090
There is no money, Hope.

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:20.563
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:24.849
I wrote the suicide note.

01:09:27.359 --> 01:09:29.124
You killed Coach P?

01:09:31.359 --> 01:09:32.540
No.

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:36.884
No, I wrote the letter after I heard
that Coach P had killed herself.

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:43.761
You are a sick fucking man.

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:46.819
I just didn't know what else to do with you!

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:50.300
It was my one shot
to get you to do something with your life.

01:09:50.399 --> 01:09:55.691
For you to be happy again,
and for me to get my sweet little girl back.

01:09:56.120 --> 01:10:00.205
Do something with my life?
How about I'm a national fucking hero!

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:01.805
Yes. You were.

01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:05.607
I am! You are nothing!

01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:10.408
You are a bitch! Now shut
your mouth before I shut it for you!

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:23.641
Hope.

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:29.931
You got injured.

01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:36.611
You had a dream to get back out there
that your body couldn't handle.

01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:43.010
It was brutal to have your time cut short,
and it broke you.

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:45.290
And it broke my heart.

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:52.640
But someone had to tear down those walls
that you put up before it was too late.

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:05.009
I'd say I was sorry, but I'm not.

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:09.900
'Cause for the first time in years,
I've seen glimpses of the old Hope,

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.525
and she's wonderful.

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:13.970
You're so good at coaching.

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:18.090
I think you even like it.

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:21.490
I was doing it for the money.

01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:24.969
I don't believe that's still true.

01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:27.050
Let me get this straight.

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:31.928
I take months out of my life,

01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:36.246
teach this wannabe everything I know,

01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:40.168
so that everyone in Amherst
can forget about me.

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:43.921
For nothing.

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:49.290
Great job, Dad.

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:55.241
You really made my life so much better.

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:14.580
Let's go down on the floor right now
with Awesome Dawes-on.

01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:15.820
- Want another?
- What can we expect in

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:17.780
the Women's Finals tomorrow, Dominique?

01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:19.980
Well, both Christa Carpenter
and Mighty Maggie

01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:22.820
have a legitimate shot
at winning an individual gold medal.

01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:26.367
It could come down to their final event,
which is the floor exercise.

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:31.525
Your girl is doing good.

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:35.765
Your little demon is, too.

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:38.540
Hey, if Maggie medals, who knows?

01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:40.881
You might have a future
on the US Team coaching staff.

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:46.084
Great.

01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:48.808
I see you got your dream killers
on display tonight.

01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:52.970
You look good.

01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:58.245
You got nice cans.

01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:04.968
White Russian? Really?

01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:08.009
Two tequilas.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.287
I don't know why you make me
so uncomfortable, Lance.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.001
Gimme that gold.

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:15.521
Pommel horse gold.

01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:22.370
- Is that all you got, Tucker?
- I got so much for you, baby.

01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:14.682
Don't sway your back. That's better.

01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:15.927
Hey there, Maggie.

01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:17.820
Hey, Ben.

01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:20.571
- I got you some tape in case you need it.
- Thank you.

01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:23.860
- All right. Good luck out there.
- Thanks.

01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:25.620
Hey.

01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:28.166
I thought I was the one
that showed up everywhere late.

01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:32.440
Yeah, well,
I didn't get too much sleep last night.

01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:33.681
Why?

01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:37.124
Afraid the cops are after you
for stealing that punch card?

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:41.246
No. I...

01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:45.569
I swung by your room last night.
I saw that you had company.

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:55.420
That's weird.
You sure you had the right room?

01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:57.887
- 'Cause I was in there...
- Drop the act, Hope.

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:02.040
I saw you there.

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:08.370
Look, I'll stick around for Maggie,
but we're done.

01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:10.806
Twitchy, I...

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.049
Oh, man, you look as tired as I feel.

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:17.260
Boned ol' Greggory last night.

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:18.885
Stay the fuck away from him, Lance.

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:20.970
Shit.

01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:24.046
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you two were a thing.

01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:28.004
- We're not.
- Good.

01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:31.324
Because she was a bad lay in '04
as she was last night.

01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:33.605
You're pathetic, Lance.

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:37.451
You're a fucking joke. Yeah.

01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:40.885
I hope he was worth it.

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:43.606
Fuck.

01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:46.740
Why do you try to ruin
everything that's good in my life?

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:49.366
Really, Lance,
what the hell did I ever do to you?

01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:53.802
All ofAmerica
talking about your fucking bronze.

01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:55.291
Third place.

01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:56.686
I won gold and silver.

01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:58.968
And everyone's got a hard-on
for Hope's miracle.

01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:01.890
Well, because of you,
I'm never gonna get that moment back.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.241
And I will damn well make sure
you don't either.

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:06.940
I had no control
over what people talked about.

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:08.180
Take that up with the god of gymnastics.

01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:10.442
I am the fucking god of gymnastics!

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:14.940
You're talking to fucking Zeus.
I made my own destiny.

01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:19.300
And not on milking some pity vote
for fame and glory over one lucky accident.

01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:21.721
But by consistency of excellence.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.082
You think you're gonna show me up again?

01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:27.529
Hell fucking no.

01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:30.980
And pretty soon, that beat-up nostalgia train
you've been riding since 2004

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:33.128
is gonna come to a pathetic and useless halt.

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:36.890
Can't fucking wait.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.525
I want you to know I talked to your mom.

01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:48.888
I'm watching out for you. Okay.

01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:54.007
Looking hot, Maggie. I like that stretch.
Don't forget that other leg.

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:57.883
So, Coach, Maggie's heading
into her final signature event.

01:17:58.080 --> 01:17:59.580
And although it's a tight race,

01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:02.604
it appears as if a spot on the podium
is Maggie's to lose.

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:04.980
Yep.

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:07.401
Well, it was 12 years ago
when you yourself were here.

01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:09.887
Both of you from the same small town,

01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:14.280
it looks as if Amherst, Ohio,
will have a new hometown hero.

01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:16.927
How do you feel about sharing that legacy?

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:20.886
Coach?

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:24.807
We share
a few things, right, Dominique? Right?

01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:27.730
Like that Brazilian javelin thrower?

01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:31.648
He knew how to throw a javelin.
You were an animal that night.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.220
- Hi.
- Yeah, hi, Hope.

01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:45.765
I'm up at the top in a box.

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:47.888
I think I saw Maggie looking for me earlier.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.047
Can you just...

01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:54.200
Can you tell her that I'm here, I'm cheering,
and I am so, so proud of her?

01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:56.201
Yep.

01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:01.489
Maggie, your mom just called.
She said she's here and she loves you.

01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:03.161
What?

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:04.770
Maggie! Maggie!

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.162
- Maggie! Maggie! Maggie!
- Hope?

01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:09.169
Hope, what did you say about my mom?

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.525
Hope, what about my mom?

01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:28.446
Your mom isn't here. Her plane crashed.

01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:29.740
Wait, what?

01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:32.620
She's with Coach P, taking the ol' dirt nap.

01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:35.371
- What?
- Welcome to the motherless daughter club.

01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:37.046
No.

01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:38.780
Maggie Townsend.

01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:42.180
The gold medal is at stake now,
with China's Han Li Chung

01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:43.900
currently clinging to first place,

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.740
and Christa Carpenter of the United States
narrowing second.

01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:48.365
- No, please!
- You have the rest of your life to cry.

01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:50.209
No, I don't! Don't make me do it! Please!

01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:55.740
I'm looking forward to see
what she brings to the stage right now, Nina.

01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:56.820
As am I, Heath.

01:19:56.920 --> 01:20:00.260
Maggie always brings such an incredible mix
of grace and athleticism.

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:01.805
She is just joy to watch and...

01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:04.930
That's gonna be at least
a three-tenths point deduction.

01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:07.487
You know,
I talked to Coach Greggory earlier today

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:11.406
and she said that Maggie has a tendency
to be a whiny vagina.

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:13.885
Hope, what about my mom?

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:23.081
Your mom's here.

01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:28.240
There's my baby! Hi, Maggie!

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:30.768
Look it! She's mine! She's my daughter!

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:35.243
I'm not gonna be a janitor anymore! Maggie!

01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:38.100
- She said she loves you.
- Now on the floor,

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:40.726
from the United States, Maggie Townsend.

01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:41.927
All right.

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:46.930
Spring from your toes, and trust
you're gonna have enough momentum.

01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:51.606
Stop annoying me and go for it.

01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:01.285
Oh, my God.

01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:09.204
USA, USA, USA!

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.570
Maggie!

01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:19.931
USA, USA, USA!

01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:33.881
Maggie! Maggie!

01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:11.180
- Hey, Doris.
- Hey, Hope.

01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:12.900
I saw you coming across the street.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.206
There you go.

01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:19.249
So, when's Miss Maggie
coming back exactly?

01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:21.580
She's still in Toronto doing press.

01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:24.220
I heard the mayor's office
is getting the parade together,

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:25.970
which'll be a hoot.

01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:29.167
Look. It's Mighty Maggie.

01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:33.060
This is a dream, really.

01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:36.140
And, you know,
I was taught that this is a team effort

01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:37.980
and to always credit my coach first.

01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:42.324
So, this gold medal,
I owe it to you, Hope Greggory.

01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:44.040
Thank you.

01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:46.451
With that being said,

01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:50.100
I have a responsibility to myself
to take advantage of every opportunity

01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:53.010
that being a global brand offers
while training for my next victory.

01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:55.980
I need someone in my corner
that sees the big picture,

01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:57.300
that has a vision for me.

01:24:57.400 --> 01:25:01.086
Not just with my athletic talents,
but for my entire career.

01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:04.580
After many long discussions with my mom
following my victory,

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:07.968
I have learned that it takes a gold medalist
to understand one.

01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:12.460
That's why my mom and I
will be moving to Los Angeles, California,

01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:14.860
and I will start training
with my brand-new coach

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:17.531
and fellow gold medalist, Lance Tucker.

01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:23.008
That fucking bitch.

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:26.004
Thank you. Thank you.

01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:45.563
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:50.971
You hear about that ungrateful little bitch?

01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:55.005
If you're referring to Maggie, yeah.
I heard she won't be coming back.

01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:57.927
She didn't even say it to my face.

01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:00.890
- Yeah.
- I didn't see that coming.

01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:05.926
Yeah, I don't think we did.

01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:09.771
Fuck her, right? Who needs her?

01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:13.525
The gym did.

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:17.460
She was our last hope
to keep this place going.

01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:19.562
Bank's taking it on Monday, so...

01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:23.251
I guess that'll give us
some more time to hang out.

01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:25.611
Really, Hope?

01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:28.366
Grow up.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.604
Just grow up.

01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:42.841
I am soaring right now.

01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:51.129
Hey, isn't that other gymnast girl
supposed to be signing pictures today?

01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:53.601
- Why are you talking so much?
- Yep.

01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:56.804
Sorry, everybody,
Mighty Maggie is a no-show!

01:26:57.560 --> 01:26:59.801
- I'm very sorry.
- I came all the way from Akron!

01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:03.686
I'm sorry, I'm very sorry! It's a no-show!

01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:05.940
She will not be here today!

01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:08.646
Breaks my heart, too! It really does.

01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:10.890
Thank you very much.

01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:21.926
What are you doing?

01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:27.810
- Check, check.
- Who's that?

01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:34.685
Maggie Townsend.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.729
Maggie Townsend, folks.

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:42.085
The butterfly has left the nest.

01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:53.121
I'm not gonna stand up here and pretend
it doesn't hurt like fucking hell.

01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:59.204
Sometimes we hurt people
when we're balls deep in our own bullshit.

01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:06.890
Sometimes it feels like
we can't get out of that.

01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:11.807
But it doesn't mean it's game over.

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:18.047
Throughout history,
those who are truly great, have stepped up.

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:21.490
Just like all of you.

01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:24.841
You give me a smile or a wave.

01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:28.900
Or sometimes you break
the celebrity boundary and come up to me,

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.721
tell me about where you were
on the day I made this country proud.

01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:38.123
There is a reason I call this town my home.

01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:44.043
'Cause you fuckers remind me of who I am.

01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:49.564
And who I can be.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.286
I am

01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:01.570
Coach Hope.

01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:11.727
Hi, sweetie.

01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:16.411
- I heard about Maggie. I'm so sorry.
- Yep.

01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:21.682
Listen, I have a few things
I need to attend to tomorrow morning.

01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:24.168
Can I count on you to make me Bisquick?

01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:27.140
Or will you write me a letter
from my dead coach saying it'll happen,

01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:29.049
and then it'll all be a lie?

01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:31.886
I should have never betrayed your trust.

01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:35.647
- And I never will again.
- Yep.

01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:41.843
- You want me to wake you?
- Nope. Got it.

01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:50.406
Thank you, Dad.

01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:05.083
All right, I'll be right back.

01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:18.820
- Hello?
- Twitchy, so glad you picked up.

01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:21.220
- What?
- Meet me at the gym in 20 minutes.

01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:23.926
- There is no more gym.
- No, I know.

01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:27.980
Just meet me there and I promise
I'll never ask you for anything again.

01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:29.206
Please, Twitchy.

01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:31.807
It's an emergency. Thank you.

01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:39.204
All right, uniforms are mandatory, people.
They are $50 each.

01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:41.522
$100 with an autograph.

01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:44.525
No refunds, no exchanges,
and I don't have change,

01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:46.967
so whatever extra you give me,
I will keep as a donation.

01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:54.980
Hang tight.
It's just gonna be a few more minutes

01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:57.048
and then we'll get inside and I'll show...

01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:00.166
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:01.361
Great.

01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:02.561
After you.

01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:05.883
- About time. You're, like, 20 minutes late.
- Yeah.

01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:09.008
That's for you. All of it.

01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:11.564
- Jesus.
- Come on.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.620
I need you to unlock the doors.

01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:17.722
Okay, what's going on?

01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:20.940
What's going on is
you're being very unprofessional

01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:23.420
by not unlocking the doors
for all these nice people

01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:24.885
who are here for gymnastics lessons.

01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:27.643
Hope, I don't know what's happening.

01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:31.481
All right. I've prepared a statement.
Just wait right there.

01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:39.245
"Yesterday at the mall, I instructed
all these people to come here today.

01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:41.368
"Point to all the people." Yeah...

01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:46.571
- These are the people that have come.
- I understand.

01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:53.448
"So, this is where we met,
at this gym years ago.

01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:56.286
"Keeping it alive is my gift to you.

01:31:57.080 --> 01:31:58.844
"And it won't suck for me either.

01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:03.410
"I would like to say to you now
that I am so sorry, co-pilot.

01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:07.402
"When you win a medal the way that I did,

01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:11.287
"you start to believe that
nothing will be better than that feeling.

01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:16.367
"But each moment I've had with you,
it tops that, each and every time."

01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:20.245
It's true.

01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:24.260
"Hurting you was the most dumbass thing
that I've ever done.

01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:25.646
"Will you please forgive me?

01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:28.121
"A-plus on spelling.
Good luck, Hope. Love, Dad."

01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:30.362
Fuck. That...
That last sentence wasn't for you.

01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:32.290
My dad spellchecked,
but I wrote it all myself.

01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:35.660
You can see that's in my handwriting,
and then that's in my dad's handwriting, so...

01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:37.808
- I believe you.
- Okay.

01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:41.246
- You could have that.
- Thank you.

01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:45.401
Truth.

01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:49.447
I am really, really sorry.

01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:53.527
And I really, really like you.

01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:03.283
Well, yeah.
I mean, it really, really sucked.

01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:07.728
You really, really hurt me.

01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:13.481
But also, truth.

01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:18.001
I've always really, really liked you.

01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:24.645
And I really, really forgive you.

01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:28.371
Good call, Ben.

01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:31.646
That's the first time you called me "Ben."

01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:36.522
Actually, I prefer "Twitchy."

01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:39.340
That was a fake one.

01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:40.646
That was real.

01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:54.886
