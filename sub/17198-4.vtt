03:09.542 --> 03:11.272
No rigor.

03:11.272 --> 03:14.132
Must have been dead
at least two to three days.

03:14.132 --> 03:15.772
Maybe longer.

03:15.772 --> 03:17.603
She's been strangled.

03:26.182 --> 03:28.802
The car's registered
to Greta Pritchard

03:28.802 --> 03:30.542
at the address I've given you.

03:30.542 --> 03:33.072
She's a 27-year-old
primary school teacher.

03:33.072 --> 03:35.222
Any news from pathology?

03:35.222 --> 03:37.572
Initial report
suggests the body

03:37.572 --> 03:40.902
has been in the water
for two or three days.

03:40.902 --> 03:44.281
We're on our way to Greta's home
address now. Thank you, DS Owens.

06:09.372 --> 06:12.132
According to the neighbour,
Greta Pritchard left her car

06:12.132 --> 06:14.382
outside the house after
work on Monday night.

06:14.382 --> 06:17.242
The next day, the car was gone.
Greta hasn't been seen since.

06:17.242 --> 06:19.551
It looks as though
she may have left in a hurry.

06:21.042 --> 06:23.102
There was broken glass on the floor

06:23.102 --> 06:25.262
and fresh flowers
stuffed into the bin.

06:25.262 --> 06:27.182
Spat with a boyfriend?

06:27.182 --> 06:28.774
Yeah, possibly.

07:15.422 --> 07:16.832
Mr Pritchard?

07:28.452 --> 07:32.297
We still need to formally identify
the body, Mr Pritchard.

07:35.532 --> 07:37.409
When did you last see Greta?

07:43.962 --> 07:45.463
Last weekend.

07:47.812 --> 07:49.313
Friday, I...

07:51.562 --> 07:53.211
..can't remember.

07:57.752 --> 08:00.182
Was there anyone else in the car?

08:00.182 --> 08:01.513
No.

08:09.982 --> 08:11.722
I want to see her.

09:07.272 --> 09:08.921
Mr Pritchard?

09:14.952 --> 09:16.647
It's not Greta.

09:19.312 --> 09:21.143
That is not my daughter.

09:41.862 --> 09:44.729
Do you have any idea where your
daughter may be, Mr Pritchard?

09:48.002 --> 09:49.503
I'm sorry.

09:52.272 --> 09:55.002
Greta hasn't been seen
at home for over three days.

09:56.582 --> 09:58.552
You've got to find her.

09:58.552 --> 10:00.474
We're doing all we can to trace her.

10:02.722 --> 10:04.832
Does she have a boyfriend?

10:04.832 --> 10:06.242
No.

10:08.072 --> 10:09.664
Are you sure?

10:10.832 --> 10:13.084
Someone who may have
bought her flowers?

10:18.102 --> 10:19.932
There was someone.

10:19.932 --> 10:21.615
A while back.

10:22.882 --> 10:25.602
Harry something.
Did you ever meet him?

10:25.602 --> 10:28.605
Yes. Unfortunately. Twice.

10:29.682 --> 10:30.853
You didn't approve?

10:33.242 --> 10:35.267
He wasn't good enough for her.

10:38.682 --> 10:40.798
Do you know where
we may find Harry?

10:48.292 --> 10:50.442
We'll need a recent
photograph of Greta.

10:52.602 --> 10:54.490
DC Ellis will drive you home.

10:55.932 --> 10:57.103
Lloyd?

10:58.882 --> 11:00.338
Hello, sir.

11:01.882 --> 11:04.419
Mr Pritchard was very good to me
when my father died.

11:05.682 --> 11:07.468
He was my old headmaster, sir.

11:32.542 --> 11:35.072
Greta Pritchard's life may
still be in danger, sir.

11:35.072 --> 11:36.992
We need to identify
the woman in the car.

11:36.992 --> 11:40.792
If we can find out who she is,we will be 
a step closer to finding Greta Pritchard.

11:40.792 --> 11:42.242
I agree, sir.

11:42.242 --> 11:44.733
Let me know as soon as there
are any developments.

13:13.232 --> 13:16.052
Could Greta and the dead woman
have been lovers?

13:16.052 --> 13:18.065
But her father said
she had a boyfriend.

13:19.332 --> 13:21.311
Maybe she couldn't make up her mind.

13:23.172 --> 13:26.872
Maybe Greta killed her lover,

13:26.872 --> 13:29.312
hid the body in the car,

13:29.312 --> 13:32.042
dumped the car in the lake
and then disappeared.

13:33.062 --> 13:34.942
That's why she left in a hurry.

13:34.942 --> 13:37.285
Or maybe that's what the killer
wants us to think.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.672
Some place.

14:03.672 --> 14:05.321
It was in its heyday.

14:06.812 --> 14:09.252
The owner died of a broken heart.

14:09.252 --> 14:10.947
It's been empty ever since.

14:12.442 --> 14:15.536
Where's the school?
Just around the corner.

14:35.832 --> 14:38.642
It's fair to say
we're a close team.

14:38.642 --> 14:40.472
How do you mean?

14:40.472 --> 14:43.332
The school. We're fighting
to keep it open.

14:43.332 --> 14:45.914
Greta's a big part of that fight.
And is this Greta?

14:49.102 --> 14:50.364
Yes.

14:51.822 --> 14:54.912
And who is this?
Mr Rhys Jones. Gareth.

14:54.912 --> 14:56.140
He left last year.

14:57.542 --> 14:58.804
We had to let him go.

15:01.472 --> 15:02.473
Cutbacks.

15:06.252 --> 15:08.607
Greta's wonderful with the children.

15:12.262 --> 15:14.048
It's in her blood.

15:21.822 --> 15:23.744
'When did you last see Greta? '

15:25.242 --> 15:27.542
On Monday.
After work.

15:27.542 --> 15:30.262
We went to Aber for a lecture
in the evening.

15:30.262 --> 15:32.602
Did you travel there together?

15:32.602 --> 15:35.832
No. She drove home first
and came in on the train.

15:35.832 --> 15:39.122
There were drinks afterwards.
We decided to stay.

15:39.122 --> 15:41.832
How long were you there for?
A few hours.

15:41.832 --> 15:44.050
Both of you? No.

15:45.162 --> 15:47.842
Greta took a call. 
Went outside.

15:47.842 --> 15:49.482
And then?

15:49.482 --> 15:51.962
She came back in,
grabbed her coat and left.

15:51.962 --> 15:53.932
You didn't think that was odd?

15:53.932 --> 15:56.272
I was surprised
she didn't say goodbye.

15:56.272 --> 15:58.802
And when she didn't turn
up for work the next day?

15:58.802 --> 16:01.102
She sent me a text
early Tuesday morning

16:01.102 --> 16:03.212
saying she wasn't feeling well.

16:03.212 --> 16:05.272
When did you make contact last?

16:05.272 --> 16:07.342
She sent another on Wednesday.

16:07.342 --> 16:10.622
I texted her back, told her to let
me know when she was feeling better,

16:10.622 --> 16:12.542
said we'd manage until then.

16:12.542 --> 16:15.272
We'll need to see those texts.
Yes, of course.

16:16.342 --> 16:19.721
In recent weeks,
did Greta seem worried? Anxious?

16:20.842 --> 16:22.298
No, not really.

16:23.322 --> 16:27.270
But a few weeks ago, there was
a man she'd been seeing. Harry.

16:28.622 --> 16:31.342
He turned up at the school,
was hanging round at the gate.

16:31.342 --> 16:32.752
Refused to go.

16:35.462 --> 16:36.827
My husband.

16:42.542 --> 16:44.282
Does he work here?

16:44.282 --> 16:46.152
Not by choice!

16:46.152 --> 16:49.062
He's a carpenter on the estate.
Renovation.

16:49.062 --> 16:52.102
But he helps us here
at the school too.

16:52.102 --> 16:53.892
It's all hands on deck.

16:53.892 --> 16:56.429
It's the only way
we can keep the place open.

17:10.012 --> 17:11.330
Mr Parry?

17:13.061 --> 17:14.893
I'm here about Greta Pritchard.

17:16.482 --> 17:18.122
Everything all right?

17:18.122 --> 17:20.431
We found her car abandoned.
She's missing.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.472
How well do you know her?

17:23.472 --> 17:26.474
Pretty well.
Her and Rhian are a good team.

17:31.112 --> 17:33.546
Where were you on Monday night,
Mr Parry?

17:34.902 --> 17:36.222
Erm...

17:36.222 --> 17:39.222
In my workshop on the estate.
What's this about?

17:39.222 --> 17:41.282
She's been missing for four days.

17:41.282 --> 17:44.991
And we have reason to believe that
her disappearance is suspicious.

17:46.392 --> 17:48.922
Your wife mentioned an altercation
you had with a man

17:48.922 --> 17:51.032
outside the school gates
a while back.

17:51.032 --> 17:53.842
Oh, I wouldn't call it that.

17:53.842 --> 17:57.642
It scared her.
He seemed a nasty piece of work.

17:58.722 --> 18:00.362
Harry someone?

18:00.362 --> 18:03.362
Was he a local boy?
Do you know him? No.

18:03.362 --> 18:05.808
Can you remember anything about him?

18:07.012 --> 18:10.994
No. But judging by the show
he put on, she's well rid of him.

18:15.020 --> 18:16.999
Why didn't anyone phone the police?

18:18.530 --> 18:20.418
Would it have made a difference?

18:45.960 --> 18:48.160
'Greta took a train into Aber
on Monday night,'

18:48.160 --> 18:50.410
got a call, left,
and hasn't been seen since.

18:50.410 --> 18:52.520
How did she get home? Train? Taxi?

18:52.520 --> 18:55.330
Or somebody gave her a lift.
But who? Check the records.

18:55.330 --> 18:58.720
See if she had any contact with the
police and if anything came of it.

19:07.050 --> 19:08.550
You were right.

19:08.550 --> 19:11.550
Greta Pritchard contacted the police
on a number of occasions

19:11.550 --> 19:13.800
to complain about malicious
communications.

19:13.800 --> 19:16.660
Threatening texts,
anonymous letters, hang-ups.

19:16.660 --> 19:18.680
"Without me, you are nothing.

19:18.680 --> 19:20.970
"Stop playing games
or you'll regret it."

19:20.970 --> 19:24.770
She also thought that somebodywas breaking 
into her house when she wasn't there.

19:24.770 --> 19:27.630
Who? Harry. Harry Jenkins.
The ex-boyfriend?

19:27.630 --> 19:31.100
The Harry something that likes
to hang out school gates? Him?

19:31.100 --> 19:32.510
Yes. Him.

20:32.930 --> 20:35.239
Harry Jenkins? That's right.

20:37.670 --> 20:41.090
Working late? It's either
that or I don't get paid.

20:41.090 --> 20:43.399
We'd like to talk to you
about Greta Pritchard.

20:45.030 --> 20:46.816
Have you seen her recently?

20:50.140 --> 20:53.098
Mr Jenkins? Greta's paranoid.

20:54.400 --> 20:56.560
It's all in her head. Oh, yeah?

20:56.560 --> 21:00.500
Like the malicious texts you sent
her? The anonymous letters?

21:00.500 --> 21:03.731
Like turning up to the school
and causing trouble, Mr Jenkins?

21:04.760 --> 21:07.115
Is that in her head too?
I needed to talk to her.

21:08.230 --> 21:10.480
She wouldn't listen.
Is that right?

21:10.480 --> 21:14.560
"You are naked.
My hand's on your neck."

21:14.560 --> 21:18.260
"Don't breathe. 
Don't scream."

21:18.260 --> 21:20.285
That's personal.

21:22.010 --> 21:23.890
She got off on it.

21:23.890 --> 21:25.721
We both did.

21:27.310 --> 21:29.040
Where is she?

21:29.040 --> 21:31.760
How should I know?
I haven't seen her for weeks.

21:31.760 --> 21:33.780
Your people told me not to.

21:33.780 --> 21:36.317
I'd like you to have a look
at this photograph.

21:38.040 --> 21:39.644
Do you know her?

21:41.140 --> 21:42.641
I don't know.

21:44.800 --> 21:46.620
Have another look.

21:50.890 --> 21:54.410
I think I've seen her before.
Where? I can't remember.

21:54.410 --> 21:57.368
Try harder, Mr Jenkins.
This woman has just lost her life.

22:01.860 --> 22:03.920
I saw her in Borth once.

22:03.920 --> 22:05.615
With Greta.

22:09.690 --> 22:11.237
A few weeks back.

22:15.830 --> 22:19.300
Were they friends?
I don't know. Lovers?

22:21.410 --> 22:22.670
No.

22:22.670 --> 22:25.580
You and Greta,
how did you meet? At the pub.

22:25.580 --> 22:28.770
She asked me to take her home.
We hadn't even spoken.

22:28.770 --> 22:30.453
Was she drunk?

22:31.580 --> 22:34.060
She likes a drink.
And you took advantage of that?

22:35.560 --> 22:37.910
It was Greta that called 
the shots, not me.

22:37.910 --> 22:39.696
And was it Greta that ended it?

22:41.940 --> 22:45.410
She said she'd found someone
who understood her better.

22:46.770 --> 22:48.690
Oh, yeah? Do you have a name?

22:48.690 --> 22:50.560
Why would I care?

22:50.560 --> 22:52.494
After we finished, she went mental.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.740
You see this?

23:00.880 --> 23:04.020
Greta did it. Completely lost it.

23:04.020 --> 23:08.380
Attacked me. Said I was stalking
her. Calling all the time.

23:08.380 --> 23:10.496
And were you? No.

23:11.660 --> 23:13.160
Never.

23:13.160 --> 23:15.469
Like I said, she's paranoid.

23:16.910 --> 23:20.330
Just like her father.
Gwilym Pritchard?

23:20.330 --> 23:22.250
Always checking up on her.

23:22.250 --> 23:23.890
Controlling her.

23:23.890 --> 23:25.869
Have you ever met him?

23:28.020 --> 23:30.130
Greta was afraid of him.

23:30.130 --> 23:34.112
Of what he'd say if he saw her
with someone like me.

24:19.730 --> 24:22.350
Have you identified
the woman in the car yet?

24:22.350 --> 24:23.851
No.

24:26.290 --> 24:27.370
And Greta?

24:29.290 --> 24:30.461
No news.

24:42.460 --> 24:45.270
Mr Pritchard,
did you call Greta a lot?

24:46.450 --> 24:48.133
I'm her father.

24:49.400 --> 24:51.186
I was worried about her.

24:55.630 --> 24:57.700
When Bethan my wife died...

25:00.090 --> 25:03.280
.. it was as though something
in Greta died too.

25:03.280 --> 25:07.070
She was different somehow.
Looking for different things.

25:07.070 --> 25:08.810
In what way?

25:11.100 --> 25:14.010
It was as though
nothing mattered any more.

25:14.010 --> 25:15.602
Was she angry?

25:16.820 --> 25:17.991
Yes.

25:19.070 --> 25:20.480
With herself.

25:21.700 --> 25:24.180
With life. Is that why she drank?

25:26.250 --> 25:28.263
What are you trying to suggest?

25:36.140 --> 25:38.060
Was she ever violent?

25:38.060 --> 25:39.322
No.

25:40.450 --> 25:42.610
But she did argue?

25:42.610 --> 25:44.111
Yes.

25:46.450 --> 25:49.360
The two of us are as stubborn
as each other.

25:49.360 --> 25:51.510
That's what her mother used to say.

25:51.510 --> 25:53.250
Greta was close to her mother?

25:54.470 --> 25:55.687
Yes.

25:58.450 --> 26:01.738
I felt like the odd one out
at times.

26:03.840 --> 26:05.530
I shouldn't say that.

26:05.530 --> 26:07.122
Sorry.

26:09.230 --> 26:12.199
I devoted my whole life
to other people's children.

26:14.900 --> 26:17.118
I should have taken
better care of my own.

26:18.560 --> 26:20.530
And now it's too late.

26:20.530 --> 26:22.870
We don't know that, Mr Pritchard.

26:22.870 --> 26:24.337
Don't we?

26:34.400 --> 26:37.176
We will find out who the dead
woman is, Mr Pritchard.

26:38.530 --> 26:41.920
And when we do, we'll find out
what happened to your daughter.

27:10.550 --> 27:12.336
Sir, I've got something.

27:18.850 --> 27:22.035
Greta's been visiting dating sites,
looking for Mr Right.

27:23.350 --> 27:26.490
Did she find him?
Ben Willis from Perth in Scotland.

27:26.490 --> 27:29.300
They had some winks,
then exchanged messages.

27:29.300 --> 27:31.460
Winks? You wink at someone you like,

27:31.460 --> 27:33.660
then they contact you
if they like you back.

27:33.660 --> 27:35.020
This guy liked her back.

27:35.020 --> 27:37.363
You know a lot about
dating sites, Lloyd.

27:38.820 --> 27:40.640
This Ben Willis guy?

27:40.640 --> 27:43.550
They exchanged messages,
then he deactivated,

27:43.550 --> 27:46.130
stopped using his dating account,
used e-mail instead.

27:46.130 --> 27:48.190
What kind of messages?

27:48.190 --> 27:50.499
Intimate. Sometimes explicit.

27:52.740 --> 27:54.660
Is this the man in Greta's life?

27:54.660 --> 27:58.130
Looks like internet contact only and
Greta ended that three months ago.

27:58.130 --> 28:00.140
Maybe that made him angry.

28:03.660 --> 28:04.930
Sian?

28:04.930 --> 28:07.930
Greta Pritchard got a taxi.
I've spoken to the driver.

28:07.930 --> 28:11.680
He remembers driving her back to Borth 
on Monday night from Aberystwyth.

28:11.680 --> 28:14.210
She was on the phone
rowing with somebody.

28:14.210 --> 28:16.970
She was shouting all the way home.
She was upset, angry.

28:16.970 --> 28:19.130
Who with? Did he get a name?

28:19.130 --> 28:20.779
Harry Jenkins.

28:32.110 --> 28:36.190
All I did was send
some drunken texts.

28:36.190 --> 28:38.260
The phone calls, 
the silent hang-ups.

28:38.260 --> 28:40.130
You were stalking her.

28:40.130 --> 28:42.240
Why would I waste my minutes?

28:42.240 --> 28:44.071
She's the one chasing me.

28:45.480 --> 28:47.630
Check my phone records.
I didn't call her.

28:47.630 --> 28:49.416
You called her on Monday night.

28:51.050 --> 28:52.880
That was just a one-off.

28:52.880 --> 28:54.520
You were arguing.

28:54.520 --> 28:55.930
What about?

28:58.180 --> 29:00.050
She left a message.

29:00.050 --> 29:01.745
Threatening me.

29:02.910 --> 29:04.798
That's why I called her.

29:06.990 --> 29:09.436
She said she was going
to the police again.

29:10.980 --> 29:12.857
What was she going to tell us?

29:14.210 --> 29:16.650
That I'd been in her flat,
which I never.

29:16.650 --> 29:18.900
But you were stalking her.

29:18.900 --> 29:22.518
If that's what you want to call it,
yeah. I was pissed off!

29:23.730 --> 29:25.607
Angry that she dumped me.

29:27.810 --> 29:29.730
But I'm over it.

29:29.730 --> 29:31.937
It hurt your ego, didn't it?

29:35.350 --> 29:36.521
No.

29:37.790 --> 29:40.099
You had to have her, didn't you?

29:41.490 --> 29:43.321
Couldn't let her go.

29:46.180 --> 29:48.341
I thought a lot of her, right?

30:02.780 --> 30:05.647
What's this? It was in your phone.

30:07.930 --> 30:10.420
That was ages ago.
I didn't know I still had it.

30:10.420 --> 30:13.002
Where were you on Monday?
I've already said.

30:14.319 --> 30:15.911
One dead, one missing.

30:18.349 --> 30:20.169
It doesn't look good, does it?

30:24.389 --> 30:26.084
I didn't kill this girl.

30:28.939 --> 30:31.851
And I don't know where Greta is.

30:48.399 --> 30:50.599
He's full of surprises,
I'll give him that.

30:50.599 --> 30:52.519
Who? Harry Jenkins.

30:52.519 --> 30:54.909
I've been going through
the anonymous letters

30:54.909 --> 30:56.599
Greta was receiving from him.

30:56.599 --> 30:58.569
They weren't all dirty messages.

30:58.569 --> 31:01.519
It turns out Harry
is a lover of poetry.

31:01.519 --> 31:04.009
Christina Rossetti, in particular.

31:04.009 --> 31:06.299
"A fool I was to sleep at noon

31:06.299 --> 31:08.269
"And wake when night is chilly

31:08.269 --> 31:10.709
"Beneath the comfortless
cold moon

31:10.709 --> 31:13.189
"A fool to pluck my rose too soon

31:13.189 --> 31:15.214
"A fool to snap my lily."

31:16.289 --> 31:19.569
Greta Pritchard accused Harry
Jenkins of sending these letters?

31:19.569 --> 31:21.019
Apparently so.

31:21.019 --> 31:23.929
I think it's safe to say that
Harry Jenkins is no poet.

31:23.929 --> 31:26.375
Look at the paper. It's expensive.

31:27.729 --> 31:29.649
This was carefully chosen.

31:29.649 --> 31:32.459
Harry's texts were sent in anger.
They were a threat.

31:33.819 --> 31:36.679
This is a declaration of love.
So who sent them, then?

31:36.679 --> 31:39.819
What was the name of the other
teacher at Plas y Dderwen School?

31:39.819 --> 31:42.769
Gareth Rhys Jones. Yeah. Find him.
I want to speak with him.

31:42.769 --> 31:45.351
Shall we release Harry Jenkins
then, sir? Yes.

31:48.299 --> 31:50.789
Forensics have just got back
about the blonde hairs

31:50.789 --> 31:52.619
they found in Greta's house, sir.

31:52.619 --> 31:54.349
They're a match with the victim.

31:54.349 --> 31:56.979
So the dead woman
was in Greta's house? Yes.

31:56.979 --> 32:00.019
Any sign of a sexual assault?
Nothing. How did she die?

32:00.019 --> 32:02.179
Asphyxiation. Manual strangulation.

32:02.179 --> 32:04.569
She was dead before she was
put in the water, sir.

32:04.569 --> 32:05.979
Ok.

34:58.769 --> 35:00.079
Mathias.

35:00.079 --> 35:02.799
Gareth Rhys Jones, sir.
He's dead.

35:02.799 --> 35:06.553
When? Eight months ago.
Killed himself. Drowned.

35:07.629 --> 35:09.415
I'm on my way.

35:23.519 --> 35:26.519
Gareth Rhys Jones was found dead
after losing his job

35:26.519 --> 35:29.189
at Plas y Dderwen School
at the end of the summer term.

35:29.189 --> 35:32.519
His body was found washed up
in Aberdaron on the Lleyn Peninsula.

35:32.519 --> 35:34.399
The coroner ruled it was suicide.

35:34.399 --> 35:36.739
Why didn't Rhian Parry
give us this information?

35:36.739 --> 35:38.569
And what else hasn't she told us?

35:38.569 --> 35:41.099
Ben Willis. Have you found him?
No. He doesn't exist.

35:41.099 --> 35:43.299
I've spoken to the
Perthshire authorities.

35:43.299 --> 35:46.679
There's no record of anyone by the
name of Ben Willis living in Perth.

35:46.679 --> 35:49.773
It wouldn't be the first time
a man's lied about who he really is.

37:54.179 --> 37:56.289
It's peaceful here.

37:56.289 --> 37:58.679
A secret garden.

37:58.679 --> 38:00.180
Yes.

38:02.249 --> 38:04.919
The estate's been empty for years.

38:04.919 --> 38:07.539
The trust, they keep me
on to look after the gardens

38:07.539 --> 38:09.279
and take care of the house.

38:11.529 --> 38:13.315
What happened to the family?

38:15.189 --> 38:16.929
They've all gone.

38:18.369 --> 38:21.889
The man who lived here
came back from the Great War.

38:21.889 --> 38:25.313
Within six weeks, his wife
and two children were dead.

38:26.529 --> 38:28.549
Spanish flu.

38:28.549 --> 38:31.409
That's why he built the school.

38:31.409 --> 38:33.661
As a gift to the
children of the parish.

38:35.059 --> 38:36.659
A memorial.

38:36.659 --> 38:38.399
To all that he'd lost.

38:39.979 --> 38:41.810
Do you recognise her?

38:46.729 --> 38:48.390
No. Sorry, I don't.

38:50.199 --> 38:53.202
Is this the girl you
found in the car? Yes.

38:55.919 --> 38:57.284
Sorry.

39:02.199 --> 39:04.178
What about Gareth Rhys Jones?

39:07.309 --> 39:09.889
He worked with your wife
at the school, didn't he?

39:09.889 --> 39:11.949
Rhian had no choice.

39:11.949 --> 39:14.679
She had to do what was
best for the school.

39:15.939 --> 39:18.239
Nobody expected him
to take his own life.

39:18.239 --> 39:20.025
It upset everyone.

39:21.709 --> 39:23.719
Rhian still blames herself.

39:23.719 --> 39:25.220
Feels responsible.

39:26.347 --> 39:28.037
Were Gareth and Greta close?

39:28.037 --> 39:30.198
I think he had a soft spot for her.

39:31.597 --> 39:33.337
Did he confide in you?

39:34.417 --> 39:37.181
No. I was only the gardener to him.

39:41.487 --> 39:44.207
Rhian said he was good at his job.

39:44.207 --> 39:45.947
I never took to him.

39:47.207 --> 39:49.597
I didn't like the way
he talked about people.

39:49.597 --> 39:51.428
About Rhian. Greta.

39:52.457 --> 39:54.897
He didn't respect them.

39:54.897 --> 39:58.087
He took advantage of Greta
after her mother died.

39:58.087 --> 40:00.477
Now, I don't like to judge people,

40:00.477 --> 40:03.617
but you never know what's going on
in people's heads, do you?

40:05.497 --> 40:07.317
Were you and Greta close?

40:07.317 --> 40:10.423
No, not close.
Not like her and Rhian.

40:12.947 --> 40:14.687
Thanks for your time.

42:58.007 --> 43:00.627
'Do you recognise this woman? '

43:00.627 --> 43:03.067
No. She doesn't work here.

43:03.067 --> 43:05.376
Are you sure? Definitely.

43:07.007 --> 43:10.897
But I have seen her before. She was
in here recently having dinner.

43:10.897 --> 43:13.240
With who? It was my old headmaster.

45:23.227 --> 45:26.037
DI Mared Rhys. Ambulance, please.

45:26.037 --> 45:27.727
Trem y Gors.

45:27.727 --> 45:29.467
Trem y Gors.

45:30.727 --> 45:31.807
Ok?

47:11.797 --> 47:14.097
Gwilym Pritchard's bank statements.

47:14.097 --> 47:17.607
Three months ago, he started
a standing order from his account.

47:17.607 --> 47:22.157
£500 a week every week for the last
three months to a Kasia Dubrovsky.

47:22.157 --> 47:23.987
Kasia. The 'K' in the diary.

47:23.987 --> 47:26.047
He's paid her almost £6,000 so far.

47:26.047 --> 47:28.487
Why? We don't know.
There's all the information.

47:28.487 --> 47:31.347
We went through his phone records,
checked itemised bills.

47:31.347 --> 47:33.407
Gwilym regularly called
three numbers.

47:33.407 --> 47:36.687
Greta's home phone, Greta's mobile
and another mobile number.

47:36.687 --> 47:38.757
We think that might be
Kasia's mobile.

47:38.757 --> 47:40.487
We tried to call it but it's dead.

47:40.487 --> 47:42.547
We know Greta disappeared
on Monday night

47:42.547 --> 47:44.237
and the body was found on Thursday.

47:44.237 --> 47:46.117
But Gwilym's phone records show

47:46.117 --> 47:49.397
that he was still trying to call
both Greta's and Kasia's mobiles.

47:49.397 --> 47:51.407
When? Tuesday, Wednesday
and Thursday.

47:51.407 --> 47:53.657
Which he wouldn't do
if he knew Kasia was dead.

47:53.657 --> 47:55.545
So why won't he speak to us?

47:59.287 --> 48:01.630
If Kasia Dubrovsky
is our victim in the lake...

48:03.407 --> 48:05.056
..who killed her?

48:10.487 --> 48:12.227
Gwilym Pritchard's counsel says

48:12.227 --> 48:14.517
he's in no fit mental state
to be questioned.

48:14.517 --> 48:18.647
But Greta could still be out there
alive and we're running out of time.

48:18.647 --> 48:20.387
Let me see what I can do.

48:22.207 --> 48:23.708
Thank you.

48:41.567 --> 48:43.627
I hope you've brought
my computer with you.

48:43.627 --> 48:46.537
We won't keep you long.
That's good to hear.

48:46.537 --> 48:48.647
So the rumour's true then.

48:48.647 --> 48:50.517
About Gwilym Pritchard.

48:50.517 --> 48:52.314
Didn't know you cared. I don't.

48:56.807 --> 48:58.537
When did you last see him?

48:58.537 --> 49:01.631
A few months back.
He came over to Greta's place.

49:02.847 --> 49:05.947
We'd had a few drinks.
We were pretty pissed.

49:05.947 --> 49:08.950
He was angry.
We had a few choice words.

49:11.387 --> 49:12.706
What about Greta?

49:14.997 --> 49:17.847
Like I said.
She was off her head.

49:19.497 --> 49:22.728
Pushed far enough,
who knows what she's capable of?

49:25.027 --> 49:26.528
DI Rhys.

49:28.207 --> 49:30.755
Did Greta ever mentioned the name
Ben Willis to you?

49:32.857 --> 49:35.109
Never heard of him. We need to go.

49:42.417 --> 49:45.648
Gwilym Pritchard has been given
the go-ahead for questioning.

49:47.007 --> 49:50.577
Thank you, sir. His counsel is not
happy about it so tread carefully.

49:50.577 --> 49:52.499
I appreciate it, sir.

50:28.733 --> 50:30.894
We know about Kasia, Mr Pritchard.

50:32.253 --> 50:34.039
We know you gave her money.

50:35.253 --> 50:37.039
We know you called her.

50:38.343 --> 50:40.459
That you tried to contact her
and Greta.

50:48.473 --> 50:50.673
Do you think I killed Kasia?

50:50.673 --> 50:52.368
I don't know, sir.

50:53.723 --> 50:55.645
I just want you to tell me
the truth.

51:04.833 --> 51:06.516
I've been weak, Lloyd.

51:09.513 --> 51:12.903
When Bethan died I couldn't eat,
couldn't sleep.

51:14.763 --> 51:15.991
Greta...

51:17.343 --> 51:19.038
She was there all the time.

51:21.093 --> 51:22.424
She arranged the funeral.

51:24.373 --> 51:25.647
Took care of me.

51:27.283 --> 51:28.875
Cooking, cleaning.

51:31.783 --> 51:33.375
I depended on her.

51:34.593 --> 51:36.060
Too much.

51:37.783 --> 51:39.569
I was smothering her.

51:41.113 --> 51:43.456
That's why she asked
Kasia to help out.

51:45.473 --> 51:47.304
Kasia was such a lovely girl.

51:51.703 --> 51:53.204
I was lonely.

51:54.803 --> 51:56.259
I'm not proud of what I did.

51:58.783 --> 52:00.569
Did you sleep with her?

52:17.113 --> 52:18.762
And did Greta find out?

52:21.473 --> 52:22.792
Yes.

52:24.103 --> 52:25.468
Last week.

52:28.743 --> 52:30.108
She was so angry.

52:32.533 --> 52:33.898
She hates me.

52:37.183 --> 52:39.003
She thinks I betrayed her mother.

52:40.033 --> 52:41.637
Betrayed her.

52:44.163 --> 52:45.949
Last thing she said...

52:47.393 --> 52:49.088
I was dead to her.

52:55.693 --> 52:57.763
And when I saw Kasia's body...

52:59.443 --> 53:00.808
.. I panicked.

53:04.413 --> 53:06.335
I thought maybe Greta had...

53:11.543 --> 53:13.192
That's why I lied...

53:14.303 --> 53:15.804
.. in the mortuary.

53:17.403 --> 53:18.859
To protect her.

53:22.933 --> 53:24.525
Now I've lost her.

53:26.303 --> 53:28.191
I'll never get her back.

53:45.013 --> 53:46.332
Harry.

53:47.963 --> 53:49.373
Ben Willis.

53:51.383 --> 53:53.305
Greta likes to keep secrets.

53:56.163 --> 53:58.097
Who does she share them with?

53:59.543 --> 54:01.044
Not her father.

54:02.823 --> 54:04.381
Kasia Dubrovsky?

54:13.133 --> 54:16.705
I've spoken to the bank, sir. I've
got an address for Kasia Dubrovsky.

56:32.973 --> 56:36.306
Kasia Dubrovsky
comes from Gdansk, Poland.

56:37.703 --> 56:39.113
26.

56:53.783 --> 56:55.193
Oi!

57:12.823 --> 57:15.690
It's all right, it's ok,
it's fine. Are you ok?

57:16.893 --> 57:19.293
Do you speak English?
Show me your hands.

57:29.223 --> 57:32.603
I've spoken to the site owner.
Her name's Bronka Bosniak.

57:32.603 --> 57:36.073
She's been living with Kasia
for a month. Friends from home.

57:36.073 --> 57:39.353
Anything suspicious? He said he
heard an argument over a week ago.

57:39.353 --> 57:41.183
There was another girl with her.

57:41.183 --> 57:43.663
The description of her car
matches Greta Pritchard.

57:43.663 --> 57:45.543
So Greta was at the caravan?

57:45.543 --> 57:47.883
It looks that way.
When can we speak to Bronka?

57:47.883 --> 57:50.553
We're still waiting for the doctors
to discharge her.

57:50.553 --> 57:54.023
Cuts and bruises, nothing more. We
should be able to talk to her soon.

57:54.023 --> 57:55.433
Ok, thanks.

58:38.413 --> 58:39.744
Iwan?

58:46.623 --> 58:48.079
Iwan Thomas?

59:14.183 --> 59:16.583
Did you tell your wife?

59:21.073 --> 59:22.540
About Gwen.

59:25.853 --> 59:27.969
About what happened to her.

59:31.673 --> 59:32.901
No.

59:34.293 --> 59:36.602
It's you that should have died,
not Gwen.

59:38.933 --> 59:40.912
Look, Iwan... You're sorry.

59:44.983 --> 59:48.077
If you were any kind of man you'd
have faced up to what you've done.

59:49.623 --> 59:51.409
But you're just like
the rest of them.

59:53.003 --> 59:54.880
One of Prosser's boys.

01:00:17.143 --> 01:00:19.873
What have you got on Prosser
that keeps him so close to you?

01:00:22.483 --> 01:00:24.371
What's the big secret?

01:00:28.813 --> 01:00:31.903
People die and you
get away with it.

01:00:31.903 --> 01:00:33.700
You get to keep your job.

01:00:38.233 --> 01:00:39.564
Gwen.

01:00:42.123 --> 01:00:43.533
Mari Davies.

01:00:45.313 --> 01:00:46.678
Your own daughter.

01:01:00.453 --> 01:01:02.102
What do you want?

01:01:03.453 --> 01:01:05.193
My blood on your hands as well?

01:01:15.923 --> 01:01:17.709
Stay away from me.

01:02:01.393 --> 01:02:02.894
'Why did you run?

01:02:04.723 --> 01:02:06.054
'I was frightened.'

01:02:09.883 --> 01:02:11.396
Was Kasia your friend?

01:02:13.639 --> 01:02:15.095
Best friends.

01:02:16.169 --> 01:02:17.955
Since when we were little.

01:02:19.309 --> 01:02:21.419
Did you come to the UK together?

01:02:21.419 --> 01:02:22.454
No.

01:02:23.759 --> 01:02:26.728
Kasia came first, six months ago.

01:02:28.499 --> 01:02:31.219
I have only been
here for three weeks.

01:02:39.139 --> 01:02:40.401
Bronka.

01:02:42.419 --> 01:02:43.681
DCI Mathias.

01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:50.059
There's no need to be afraid.
I thought you were going to hurt me.

01:02:50.059 --> 01:02:52.919
I saw you at the hotel and at
Greta's house.

01:02:52.919 --> 01:02:54.369
I thought you had taken my friend.

01:02:54.369 --> 01:02:56.949
It's ok, Bronka, I'm a police
officer. She didn't come home!

01:02:56.949 --> 01:03:00.840
I didn't know where she was, I...
Bronka, when did you last see Kasia?

01:03:04.079 --> 01:03:05.205
Monday.

01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:09.899
Greta told her to
come to the flat...

01:03:11.439 --> 01:03:13.119
...to collect her stuff.

01:03:13.119 --> 01:03:14.393
They were friends?

01:03:16.359 --> 01:03:17.530
Yes.

01:03:19.119 --> 01:03:21.428
Sometimes Greta and
Kasia have a drink.

01:03:23.159 --> 01:03:25.787
Sometimes Kasia
stayed the night there.

01:03:26.949 --> 01:03:29.579
Greta was teaching her English.

01:03:29.579 --> 01:03:33.003
So why did Greta ask Kasia
to collect her stuff?

01:03:36.469 --> 01:03:38.199
There was an argument.

01:03:38.199 --> 01:03:39.279
What about?

01:03:45.889 --> 01:03:47.447
We need to know, Bronka.

01:03:49.219 --> 01:03:50.390
There was a row...

01:03:51.419 --> 01:03:52.886
..about Greta's father.

01:03:54.799 --> 01:03:57.279
Was Kasia sleeping with him?

01:04:01.499 --> 01:04:02.955
Yes. For money? No!

01:04:04.359 --> 01:04:06.239
It wasn't like that.

01:04:06.239 --> 01:04:09.049
Kasia cared about Greta's father.

01:04:09.049 --> 01:04:11.389
She liked him very much.

01:04:11.389 --> 01:04:14.859
Why did Greta's father
give Kasia money?

01:04:17.529 --> 01:04:19.319
It was...

01:04:19.319 --> 01:04:20.729
for Kasia's daughter...

01:04:22.129 --> 01:04:23.209
.. in Poland.

01:04:29.249 --> 01:04:32.218
To help pay for her to come here.

01:04:33.609 --> 01:04:36.055
Kasia loved her daughter very much.

01:04:38.389 --> 01:04:39.890
She missed her.

01:04:42.239 --> 01:04:44.489
The money was a gift.

01:04:44.489 --> 01:04:45.989
Can you think of anyone

01:04:45.989 --> 01:04:48.662
that would want to hurt Kasia?

01:04:51.989 --> 01:04:53.819
A friend?

01:04:53.819 --> 01:04:56.117
A colleague?
Someone she talked about?

01:04:59.769 --> 01:05:01.930
We were in a cafe with Greta...

01:05:03.849 --> 01:05:05.350
..there was a man.

01:05:07.509 --> 01:05:08.909
He was shouting.

01:05:08.909 --> 01:05:10.319
When?

01:05:12.189 --> 01:05:13.789
Last week...

01:05:13.789 --> 01:05:15.099
on the front.

01:05:15.099 --> 01:05:19.929
He was angry. Greta was upset.
Him? Was it him?

01:05:19.929 --> 01:05:22.978
No. Are you sure?
No, it is not him.

01:05:24.569 --> 01:05:27.333
No! It's him!

01:05:28.979 --> 01:05:30.799
'That's him.'

01:05:33.849 --> 01:05:35.020
This is him.

01:05:49.089 --> 01:05:51.899
I knew as soon
as I'd done it, I'd regret it.

01:05:55.089 --> 01:05:56.215
But I had to tell her.

01:05:57.849 --> 01:06:01.369
Greta wasn't pulling her weight
in school, while Rhian was doing

01:06:01.369 --> 01:06:03.379
everything for her.

01:06:03.379 --> 01:06:05.869
And with Rhian expecting
her first baby,

01:06:05.869 --> 01:06:07.518
I just didn't think it was fair.

01:06:09.059 --> 01:06:12.289
Rhian taking the strain
while Greta was out every night

01:06:12.289 --> 01:06:13.509
drowning her sorrows.

01:06:13.509 --> 01:06:15.386
And what did you tell her?

01:06:17.069 --> 01:06:18.900
That she had to stop drinking.

01:06:19.929 --> 01:06:21.339
To think of other people.

01:06:22.699 --> 01:06:26.629
To pull herself together,
stop feeling sorry for herself.

01:06:26.629 --> 01:06:29.489
To listen to those
with her best interests at heart.

01:06:29.489 --> 01:06:30.490
Like you?

01:06:32.639 --> 01:06:33.992
In a way, yes.

01:06:35.259 --> 01:06:36.624
Why didn't you tell me?

01:06:37.979 --> 01:06:39.674
I didn't want to worry you, ba.

01:06:41.069 --> 01:06:42.855
You've got enough on your plate.

01:06:43.929 --> 01:06:45.294
I thought...

01:06:47.919 --> 01:06:50.639
I thought I could
get through to her.

01:06:50.639 --> 01:06:52.186
And did you?

01:06:53.539 --> 01:06:54.710
She wouldn't listen.

01:06:55.749 --> 01:06:59.209
Made a bit of a scene.
I just left.

01:06:59.209 --> 01:07:01.459
It was embarrassing.

01:07:01.459 --> 01:07:03.814
Greta was involved
with someone online.

01:07:06.199 --> 01:07:08.781
Does the name Ben Willis
mean anything to you?

01:07:13.749 --> 01:07:15.429
No.

01:07:15.429 --> 01:07:17.169
Sorry.

01:08:06.339 --> 01:08:08.318
I hear you spoke to Iwan Thomas.

01:08:12.199 --> 01:08:13.700
That's right.

01:08:14.829 --> 01:08:18.339
Did he have anything interesting
to say for himself?

01:08:18.339 --> 01:08:20.033
The man is in pain.

01:08:26.448 --> 01:08:27.859
He's lost everything.

01:08:29.029 --> 01:08:30.814
His life is in ruins.

01:08:32.879 --> 01:08:34.948
Some people can handle the pressure.

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:39.109
Others fall by the wayside.

01:08:40.139 --> 01:08:41.174
Well...

01:08:46.139 --> 01:08:48.299
..we all have to carry our pack.

01:08:48.299 --> 01:08:50.919
Iwan Thomas is a dangerous man.

01:08:50.919 --> 01:08:53.359
He's a drunk.
He's not to be trusted.

01:08:53.359 --> 01:08:55.145
You should stay away from him.

01:08:58.988 --> 01:09:01.379
He is grieving, sir.

01:09:01.379 --> 01:09:02.970
He needs to let go of the past.

01:09:06.629 --> 01:09:08.969
Don't let him drag you down, Tom.

01:09:08.969 --> 01:09:11.078
You have pulled yourself together,

01:09:11.078 --> 01:09:12.488
put the past behind you.

01:09:12.488 --> 01:09:15.356
That is the difference
between you and him.

01:09:18.999 --> 01:09:20.045
Don't forget that.

01:09:28.238 --> 01:09:29.934
What was he doing there?

01:09:33.069 --> 01:09:35.048
Why was he at the site?

01:09:36.769 --> 01:09:37.804
I don't know.

01:09:54.959 --> 01:09:56.649
Greta Pritchard.

01:09:56.649 --> 01:10:00.069
Her mother's death
sent her off the rails.

01:10:00.069 --> 01:10:01.849
She couldn't handle the grief.

01:10:01.849 --> 01:10:04.619
She was lonely,
she found solace online.

01:10:04.619 --> 01:10:06.439
Ben Willis.

01:10:06.439 --> 01:10:08.789
But it was too much, too soon,

01:10:08.789 --> 01:10:12.019
so she broke it off. And that's
when she met Harry Jenkins.

01:10:12.019 --> 01:10:14.129
When the anonymous letters started,

01:10:14.129 --> 01:10:17.599
the silent phone calls, the
hang-ups, Greta thought it was Harry

01:10:17.599 --> 01:10:21.209
that was responsible, but it wasn't.
It was this guy - Ben Willis.

01:10:21.209 --> 01:10:24.209
Somebody has got to know who he is.

01:10:24.209 --> 01:10:25.995
You're right, Mared. But who?

01:10:57.209 --> 01:10:59.039
'Ben Willis.'

01:10:59.039 --> 01:11:01.429
Greta had a relationship
with him online,

01:11:01.429 --> 01:11:03.966
for a number of months,
before she cut contact.

01:11:04.949 --> 01:11:06.209
Ben Willis.

01:11:06.209 --> 01:11:07.710
Wait a minute.

01:11:13.569 --> 01:11:14.706
Now, then...

01:11:23.599 --> 01:11:24.873
There he is.

01:11:28.569 --> 01:11:29.900
Benjamin Willis.

01:11:31.199 --> 01:11:33.309
He was the groundsman on the estate.

01:11:33.309 --> 01:11:36.309
Helped build the school
after the Great War.

01:11:36.309 --> 01:11:38.982
He looked after the house
and gardens all his life.

01:11:47.649 --> 01:11:48.679
Can I keep this?

01:11:48.679 --> 01:11:50.658
Of course. Thanks.

01:11:55.569 --> 01:11:58.289
Benjamin Willis
devoted his life to the estate.

01:11:58.289 --> 01:12:02.179
He was obsessed by it. Arwyn Parry
knows every inch of the estate.

01:12:02.179 --> 01:12:04.809
'He also knows the history.
I think he has used the name'

01:12:04.809 --> 01:12:07.009
Ben Willis as an alias.

01:12:07.009 --> 01:12:08.279
I think he is our killer.

01:12:08.279 --> 01:12:10.249
'Get all units over to the school.'

01:12:10.249 --> 01:12:12.869
Greta could still be alive.

01:12:12.869 --> 01:12:15.360
We also need to warn Rhian.
She could be in danger.

01:14:00.887 --> 01:14:02.104
Rhian?

01:14:13.957 --> 01:14:14.958
Come on!

01:15:55.827 --> 01:15:56.862
Rhian?

01:16:23.627 --> 01:16:25.037
Are you ok?

01:16:34.927 --> 01:16:36.428
Where is he, Rhian?

01:16:52.127 --> 01:16:53.116
Rhian!

01:16:54.937 --> 01:16:56.165
Tom!

01:17:08.107 --> 01:17:09.108
Arwyn?

01:17:24.757 --> 01:17:25.746
Arwyn?

01:17:27.427 --> 01:17:28.928
Arwyn, I know you're here.

01:20:03.107 --> 01:20:04.142
Arwyn!

01:20:12.577 --> 01:20:13.612
Arwyn.

01:20:16.747 --> 01:20:18.577
It's over.

01:20:18.577 --> 01:20:20.499
I know it was you that killed Kasia.

01:20:22.607 --> 01:20:23.642
Where's Greta?!

01:20:26.027 --> 01:20:27.807
Arwyn!

01:20:27.807 --> 01:20:30.107
Here!

01:20:30.107 --> 01:20:31.187
Greta.

01:20:31.187 --> 01:20:32.407
Here!

01:20:32.407 --> 01:20:34.047
Where are you?

01:20:34.047 --> 01:20:35.127
In here!

01:20:40.367 --> 01:20:41.368
I'm over here!

01:20:43.607 --> 01:20:45.057
Hello?

01:20:45.057 --> 01:20:46.058
Hello?!

01:20:48.857 --> 01:20:50.077
Greta?!

01:20:50.077 --> 01:20:52.147
I'm in the well! Over here!

01:20:55.797 --> 01:20:57.298
Greta! Please help me! Please!

01:20:59.637 --> 01:21:01.468
Please help me! Please!

01:21:02.687 --> 01:21:04.987
Greta, it's going to be all right.

01:21:04.987 --> 01:21:07.847
Please! It's going to be fine. I'm
here to help you, ok? Don't worry.

01:22:00.297 --> 01:22:02.077
Sir!

01:22:02.077 --> 01:22:03.727
Sir.

01:22:09.347 --> 01:22:10.897
Sir.

01:22:10.897 --> 01:22:11.932
Sir!

01:23:01.437 --> 01:23:02.563
I wanted to help her.

01:23:06.497 --> 01:23:07.998
She seemed so alone.

01:23:10.157 --> 01:23:11.146
Lost.

01:23:22.017 --> 01:23:23.939
A few weeks after her mother died...

01:23:25.157 --> 01:23:27.034
.. I found her in the classroom.

01:23:28.577 --> 01:23:30.457
It was late.

01:23:30.457 --> 01:23:31.822
Everyone else had gone.

01:23:34.487 --> 01:23:35.522
She was crying.

01:23:38.707 --> 01:23:41.938
I offered her a lift home.
She wasn't fit to drive.

01:23:44.607 --> 01:23:45.687
We got to her house.

01:23:47.607 --> 01:23:48.608
It was raining.

01:23:51.177 --> 01:23:52.348
She didn't say a word.

01:23:54.317 --> 01:23:56.888
Just sat there in the car with me...

01:23:59.377 --> 01:24:01.538
..as if she didn't want to leave.

01:24:05.097 --> 01:24:06.689
When she got out of the car...

01:24:10.157 --> 01:24:12.466
I-I could still smell her.

01:24:15.317 --> 01:24:16.306
And Ben Willis?

01:24:18.357 --> 01:24:20.757
He gave his life to that estate.

01:24:21.787 --> 01:24:23.607
It meant everything to him.

01:24:27.827 --> 01:24:28.828
Being Ben...

01:24:30.217 --> 01:24:32.287
.. I could be anyone.

01:24:32.287 --> 01:24:34.209
Go anywhere.

01:24:35.707 --> 01:24:38.987
But then, Greta just cut me off.
I couldn't let that happen.

01:24:38.987 --> 01:24:40.682
And Gareth Rhys-Jones?

01:24:41.847 --> 01:24:43.297
You set him up.

01:24:43.297 --> 01:24:45.177
And then you destroyed him.

01:24:45.177 --> 01:24:47.007
He was getting too close to her.

01:24:47.007 --> 01:24:49.020
You didn't want her
to have any friends?

01:24:52.767 --> 01:24:54.792
She didn't need any friends.

01:24:56.707 --> 01:24:58.487
All she needed was me.

01:24:58.487 --> 01:24:59.806
Why kill Kasia?

01:25:01.207 --> 01:25:03.647
She was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

01:25:03.647 --> 01:25:07.017
I... She turned up at Greta's house
with flowers, found me,

01:25:07.017 --> 01:25:08.947
started screaming...

01:25:08.947 --> 01:25:10.207
And you strangled her.

01:25:10.207 --> 01:25:11.287
I had no choice!

01:25:31.587 --> 01:25:34.317
What about your wife, Arwyn?

01:25:36.977 --> 01:25:38.148
What about your baby?

01:25:46.487 --> 01:25:48.091
I-I...Iove Rhian.

01:25:52.487 --> 01:25:54.227
But...

01:25:54.227 --> 01:25:55.262
I thought...

01:25:56.707 --> 01:25:58.356
I thought I could have it all.

01:27:17.947 --> 01:27:18.948
Are you ok, sir?

01:27:20.437 --> 01:27:21.472
Yeah, I will be.

01:27:22.867 --> 01:27:24.892
And you? Yes, sir.

01:27:38.627 --> 01:27:39.992
Thank you, Lloyd.
