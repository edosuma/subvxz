WEBVTT

00:01.377 --> 00:02.418
Previously on "The 100"...

00:02.628 --> 00:03.628
The only way to save
both our people

00:03.837 --> 00:05.421
is if we join together.

00:05.631 --> 00:06.714
Without someone on the inside to
lower their defenses,

00:06.924 --> 00:07.799
an army's useless.

00:08.008 --> 00:09.008
You should go.

00:09.218 --> 00:10.551
I can get you
through the tunnels.

00:23.440 --> 00:24.691
How about getting
me down, Maya?

00:24.900 --> 00:26.109
Don't move!

00:26.318 --> 00:27.485
Agh!

00:29.571 --> 00:31.906
Take him
into custody.

00:32.116 --> 00:34.575
I'm sorry. They take their orders
from me now.

00:34.785 --> 00:36.285
Put my father
in quarantine.

00:36.495 --> 00:38.329
Yes, Mr. president.

00:38.539 --> 00:39.872
They're already
using their blood,

00:40.082 --> 00:41.874
and things are gonna
get ugly in here real fast.

00:44.837 --> 00:46.045
No!

00:46.255 --> 00:47.755
I have a message
for your leader.

00:47.965 --> 00:49.298
We're coming for him.

00:49.508 --> 00:51.342
Let our people go,
and we'll let you live.

00:51.552 --> 00:54.679
It's an 8-hour walk
back to Mount Weather.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.431
You're gonna do it in 6.

01:04.106 --> 01:05.064
Ugh!

01:57.868 --> 01:59.452
Sir, you're too far...

01:59.661 --> 02:02.789
From the door,
way too far.

02:02.998 --> 02:06.084
Just breathe.
Don't worry about me.

02:06.293 --> 02:09.253
You did it,
didn't you, sir? Huh?

02:09.463 --> 02:12.173
The marrow treatment,
it worked.

02:12.382 --> 02:13.883
We did it,
lieutenant.

02:24.436 --> 02:25.978
The ground is ours.

02:34.196 --> 02:35.404
The ground is ours.

03:09.439 --> 03:10.815
We've been
locked up for hours.

03:11.024 --> 03:11.816
If it was Bellamy--

03:12.025 --> 03:12.817
It was Bellamy.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.152
I'm telling you
he's here.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.570
All right.

03:15.779 --> 03:17.321
It doesn't make
any sense.

03:17.531 --> 03:18.322
I know what I saw.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.492
Not again.

03:21.702 --> 03:24.245
Back up, everyone.
Back up.

03:24.454 --> 03:25.830
Move!

03:29.459 --> 03:30.501
No, no!

03:30.669 --> 03:31.961
Hey, hey!
Get off her!

03:32.171 --> 03:33.045
No, not her.

03:33.255 --> 03:35.423
She needs more time
to recover.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.884
This one.

03:38.093 --> 03:39.594
No! Wait, wait!

03:39.803 --> 03:41.179
No, please! No!

03:41.388 --> 03:42.805
Stop!

03:43.015 --> 03:44.473
You can't keep
doing this to us.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.731
President Wallace said
we could go.

03:51.940 --> 03:55.109
That president Wallace
is no longer in command.

03:55.319 --> 03:57.111
He had to step down
for health reasons.

03:57.321 --> 04:01.532
I'm sorry it has to
be like this.

04:01.742 --> 04:06.037
I hope you know you're
all incredibly special to us.

04:10.125 --> 04:12.793
Clear out. Go.

04:21.803 --> 04:24.430
Has he
checked in yet?

04:24.640 --> 04:26.390
No.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.100
You worried someone's
gonna try and take a shot at you

04:28.310 --> 04:29.685
inside the ark?

04:31.980 --> 04:33.481
Wait outside, Ryder.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.820
Lexa's orders.

04:40.030 --> 04:41.113
Whatever, Clarke.

04:44.159 --> 04:45.326
He's late.

04:45.535 --> 04:46.786
What if something's
happened to him?

04:46.995 --> 04:48.246
He'll be fine.

04:52.501 --> 04:54.126
You've been busy.

04:54.336 --> 04:55.962
Why are you focusing
on the dam?

04:58.757 --> 05:01.509
I told you acid fog
was our priority.

05:01.718 --> 05:04.053
Until Bellamy gets eyes
on their dispersal system,

05:04.263 --> 05:07.723
there's only so much
I can do.

05:07.933 --> 05:10.017
Fine. Tell me
about the dam.

05:10.227 --> 05:11.978
Can we cut off
their power?

05:12.187 --> 05:14.814
Maybe. I'm still playing
with a few things.

05:15.023 --> 05:17.108
How many of these
have you made?

05:17.317 --> 05:18.693
Only two so far, but--

05:18.902 --> 05:20.444
Two? That's not
enough.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.238
There will be
reapers everywhere.

05:22.447 --> 05:25.533
High-frequency tone generators
don't grow on trees, Clarke.

05:25.742 --> 05:26.909
Wick is scrounging
for parts.

05:27.119 --> 05:30.621
Raven, I am about
to leave for Tondc,

05:30.831 --> 05:33.249
where Lexa and the heads
of all 12 grounder clans

05:33.500 --> 05:35.876
are waiting for me to
tell them we're ago,

05:36.086 --> 05:38.629
only we're not a go
because they still have acid fog,

05:38.839 --> 05:41.048
and we only have
two tone generators.

05:44.344 --> 05:50.349
Hey. We'll be ready.
We will.

05:50.559 --> 05:53.477
Ark station, do you read me?

05:53.687 --> 05:56.022
Anybody there?

05:56.231 --> 05:58.065
Bellamy,
you're late.

05:58.275 --> 05:59.608
Every 3 hours means
every 3 hours.

05:59.818 --> 06:01.027
Are you through?

06:04.323 --> 06:06.115
Have you found
the source of the acid fog?

06:06.325 --> 06:07.950
No. That's gonna
have to wait.

06:08.160 --> 06:10.870
What? No. Nothing is
more important than that.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.455
Our friends are.

06:12.664 --> 06:14.457
They're starting to
take them from the dorm

06:14.666 --> 06:17.418
one at a time
every few hours.

06:17.627 --> 06:18.502
Taking them where?

06:18.712 --> 06:19.962
I don't know.

06:20.172 --> 06:21.464
We tried to follow them,

06:21.673 --> 06:24.216
but they went
to a classified level.

06:24.426 --> 06:25.843
Maya borrowed the schematics
of the vent system

06:26.053 --> 06:27.970
from her boss,
and I'm still trying

06:28.180 --> 06:30.014
to find a way in.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.015
Anything?

06:31.224 --> 06:32.058
I think I found
a path,

06:32.267 --> 06:33.642
but it's gonna
be tight.

06:33.852 --> 06:35.144
Here's the walkie
raven asked for

06:35.354 --> 06:37.229
and the earbud.

06:37.439 --> 06:41.859
We're going to make him mobile
so he can talk to us from anywhere.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.778
Bellamy, you have
to find them.

06:43.987 --> 06:45.738
That's the plan.

06:45.947 --> 06:49.450
If you don't,
all of this is for nothing.

06:49.659 --> 06:52.119
Yeah.

06:52.329 --> 06:54.330
I'll be right back.

06:54.539 --> 06:56.582
I thought were going
to Tondc.

06:59.378 --> 07:01.379
Plans have changed.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.089
I'm staying here.

07:03.298 --> 07:04.840
The commander's
expecting you.

07:05.050 --> 07:06.217
Our people inside
Mount Weather are in trouble.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.302
I'm not going anywhere
until I know they're OK.

07:08.512 --> 07:11.097
And what can you do
for them from here?

07:11.306 --> 07:13.099
You'll go to Tondc
in my place.

07:13.308 --> 07:15.017
Lexa respects you.

07:15.227 --> 07:16.852
I'll get there soon
as I can.

07:17.062 --> 07:18.187
Clarke, wait.

07:18.397 --> 07:19.647
Put it away.

07:22.484 --> 07:25.736
Clarke, being
a good leader means

07:25.946 --> 07:27.446
knowing which
battles to fight.

07:27.656 --> 07:30.199
And which to delegate.
I know.

07:30.409 --> 07:35.204
Please I need you to go
to Tondc.

07:35.414 --> 07:37.415
Fine.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.458
I'll go.

07:39.668 --> 07:40.835
Thank you.

07:44.172 --> 07:45.840
What is it?

07:46.049 --> 07:47.675
Kane will explain.

07:47.884 --> 07:50.386
Perhaps your mother
should go.

07:50.595 --> 07:54.515
She is still the chancellor
after all.

07:54.724 --> 07:56.767
Which is why she's
needed here.

08:03.191 --> 08:04.817
Heavy lies
the crown.

08:05.026 --> 08:06.735
She shouldn't be
wearing the crown,

08:06.945 --> 08:09.196
and you shouldn't be
backing her up.

08:11.867 --> 08:14.618
What is that?

08:14.828 --> 08:19.248
A note.
Thelonious is gone.

08:19.458 --> 08:21.125
He told Sinclair to wait
two days

08:21.334 --> 08:24.420
before giving that
to us.

08:24.629 --> 08:26.297
The city of light.

08:26.506 --> 08:29.467
He says he's coming
back to save us again.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.886
He took 12 people,
12 guns.

08:32.095 --> 08:34.305
You can't go after him.
We can't spare the men.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.182
Oh, don't worry about it.
Clarke wouldn't let me

08:36.391 --> 08:38.225
even if I wanted to.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.608
Godspeed, Thelonious.

08:54.701 --> 08:58.037
Sir, do you
recognize anything?

09:02.918 --> 09:07.254
Their tent was
near here.

09:07.464 --> 09:08.839
I'm sure of it.

09:16.056 --> 09:19.433
What's the matter?
You guys got someplace better to be?

09:28.235 --> 09:29.693
You see anyone?

09:47.504 --> 09:49.838
We mean you no harm.

09:50.048 --> 09:51.131
Do you speak English?

09:51.341 --> 09:52.591
What do you want?

09:52.801 --> 09:56.345
Nothing. It looks like
you could use a hand.

09:56.555 --> 09:58.430
What are you doing
out here alone?

10:04.646 --> 10:06.897
My brother and I
were on our way to the city of light,

10:07.107 --> 10:09.858
and wastelanders
attacked.

10:10.068 --> 10:15.573
They took our horse,
all our water, everything.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.241
They killed him.

10:20.328 --> 10:23.372
This cart is all
I have left.

10:23.582 --> 10:26.000
Give her some water.

10:26.209 --> 10:27.710
Whoa, no, no,
no, no, no.

10:27.919 --> 10:29.336
We barely have enough for
ourselves here.

10:29.546 --> 10:31.755
Touch me again,
and I'll end you.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.678
In a noncriminal way.

10:43.893 --> 10:44.977
It's OK.

10:58.992 --> 11:02.077
We're on our way
to the city of light, as well.

11:02.287 --> 11:03.746
What's your name?

11:03.955 --> 11:05.914
Emori.

11:06.124 --> 11:07.583
Everyone
in the dead zone

11:07.792 --> 11:09.752
is looking for
the city of light.

11:09.961 --> 11:12.880
Almost no one
finds it.

11:13.089 --> 11:14.423
I can get you there.

11:16.676 --> 11:20.679
If you pull my cart.

11:20.889 --> 11:22.014
Done.

11:23.808 --> 11:27.686
Caspian, you're
on the first shift.

11:27.896 --> 11:29.980
Thanks
for the water.

11:30.190 --> 11:33.067
It's, uh--it was
no problem.

11:47.791 --> 11:50.542
OK.
So tell us where you're at now.

11:50.752 --> 11:54.463
I'm at an intersection.
Which way?

11:54.673 --> 11:56.382
OK. He just passed
the air filtration system

11:56.591 --> 11:59.760
on this floor,
which puts him about here.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.345
Bellamy, we think
you're close.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.722
The lab should be
up ahead.

12:03.932 --> 12:05.891
Any chance you can be
more specific?

12:14.734 --> 12:17.611
Never mind.
I got this.

12:36.506 --> 12:38.090
Is that a drill?

12:40.427 --> 12:42.261
Bone marrow
extraction.

12:49.728 --> 12:50.686
You ready
for the last treatment

12:50.895 --> 12:53.021
you'll ever need,
lieutenant?

12:53.231 --> 12:54.481
You have no idea.

12:54.691 --> 12:55.774
I've waited
my whole life

12:55.984 --> 12:56.900
to breathe fresh air.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.277
That's Emerson.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.738
Let's get back
to this secret army

13:00.947 --> 13:02.114
that she claims to have.

13:02.323 --> 13:03.824
She tell you anything
that might

13:04.033 --> 13:04.992
help us find it?

13:06.953 --> 13:09.163
Stop drilling, please.

13:09.372 --> 13:10.789
The window for extraction
after death

13:10.999 --> 13:13.417
is incredibly
short.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.502
I only need a minute.

13:15.712 --> 13:17.880
No, sir.
Nothing about the army.

13:18.089 --> 13:19.757
She did say she was
coming for you

13:19.966 --> 13:21.759
and that if we let
her people go

13:21.968 --> 13:23.260
she'll let our
people live.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.304
It's a little late
for that.

13:27.098 --> 13:28.932
I'm sorry
I failed, sir.

13:29.142 --> 13:32.519
No, it's OK. We'll
finish the job tonight.

13:32.729 --> 13:34.271
Whitman just radioed in.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.106
Apparently there's
a war council meeting

13:36.316 --> 13:38.108
happening tonight
in one of their villages,

13:38.318 --> 13:39.818
and all the leaders
are gonna be there.

13:40.028 --> 13:42.029
Sir, I feel good.
Let me take a team out

13:42.238 --> 13:43.655
and support Whitman.

13:43.865 --> 13:45.866
No. He has less chance
of being spotted if he's alone.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.493
Sir, Whitman's good,

13:47.702 --> 13:50.120
but he can't take out
that many targets alone.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.581
Which is why we're
gonna use a missile.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.585
This time, we're
not gonna miss.

14:07.639 --> 14:09.223
Please tell me
you heard all that.

14:09.432 --> 14:10.307
We heard it.

14:10.517 --> 14:11.934
We have to warn them.

14:12.143 --> 14:13.519
Did Kane take
a radio?

14:13.728 --> 14:15.354
No. This is the only
unjammed frequency.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.231
We have to keep it
open for Bellamy.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.693
If I leave now,
I can make it there in time.

14:21.903 --> 14:23.779
In time to be
blown up, you mean.

14:23.988 --> 14:25.322
When I get back,
I want to know

14:25.532 --> 14:27.825
our friends are safe
and the acid fog is down.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.244
Can you handle that?

14:30.453 --> 14:32.830
Yeah, we can
handle it. Go.

14:33.039 --> 14:33.956
Clarke, wait.

14:34.165 --> 14:35.123
Octavia was in Tondc
when I left.

14:35.333 --> 14:36.542
Is--Is she, um...

14:36.751 --> 14:40.254
She's here.
She's safe.

14:40.463 --> 14:44.299
OK. Good.
Be safe, too.

14:44.509 --> 14:46.176
I will.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.762
Octavia's in Tondc
for the meeting.

14:48.972 --> 14:49.972
Why'd you lie?

14:50.181 --> 14:52.307
Bellamy can't be
distracted.

14:52.517 --> 14:54.726
It helps no one.

14:54.936 --> 14:56.103
Hey.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.821
Don't get blown up.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.459
Last time, they
stepped foot here,

15:19.836 --> 15:22.254
we were at war
with each other.

15:22.463 --> 15:23.881
Now the 12 clans
fight together.

15:24.090 --> 15:28.260
Remember this day.
You may never see one like it again.

15:28.469 --> 15:31.763
You haven't heard
a word I've said.

15:31.973 --> 15:33.390
Sorry.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.183
Bellamy left Lincoln
in the tunnels two days ago,

15:35.393 --> 15:36.351
and he should be back--

15:36.561 --> 15:38.270
Lincoln is no longer
your concern.

15:40.023 --> 15:42.274
Look. I've done everything you've
asked me to do,

15:42.483 --> 15:43.859
and I'll continue
to do so,

15:44.068 --> 15:45.611
but what you're
asking now is impossible.

15:45.820 --> 15:47.738
I'm not asking.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.407
We're at war, and a warrior
does not mourn

15:50.617 --> 15:53.452
those she's lost
till after the battle is won.

15:57.081 --> 15:59.291
Go stand watch
with the other seconds.

15:59.500 --> 16:00.667
Assassins
from the Mountain

16:00.877 --> 16:02.294
will try again.

16:02.503 --> 16:04.171
We need to be ready.

16:09.594 --> 16:11.345
So I got to ask.

16:11.554 --> 16:12.930
What made you ditch
your home

16:13.139 --> 16:16.767
and risk your life
to cross the beach from hell?

16:16.976 --> 16:18.518
It doesn't matter.

16:18.728 --> 16:20.228
No. Come on.
Take my mind

16:20.438 --> 16:24.274
off all the fun
we're having.

16:24.484 --> 16:27.653
It wasn't my
decision to leave.

16:27.862 --> 16:29.947
Kicked out?

16:30.156 --> 16:33.075
OK. Now I'm interested.
What'd you do?

16:33.284 --> 16:34.826
If I told you,

16:35.036 --> 16:37.412
you would not look
at me the same.

16:37.622 --> 16:39.623
Maybe.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.708
Then again, I might
surprise you.

16:44.295 --> 16:46.672
What about you?

16:46.881 --> 16:49.841
How did you end up
in the dead zone?

16:50.051 --> 16:51.426
I could tell you
the gory details,

16:51.636 --> 16:53.637
but since you're one
of the few people on this planet

16:53.846 --> 16:57.516
who doesn't hate me
at the moment,

16:57.725 --> 17:00.018
I don't think
I want to blow it.

17:00.228 --> 17:04.064
Now I'm interested.

17:04.273 --> 17:07.275
OK. You really
want to know?

17:07.485 --> 17:09.611
I killed two people,

17:09.821 --> 17:11.905
tried to kill
two more.

17:12.115 --> 17:14.908
I had my reasons,
but nobody cared.

17:15.118 --> 17:18.245
I'm the bad guy.

17:18.454 --> 17:19.955
Told you I'd blow it.

17:35.930 --> 17:39.057
My people saw me
as a stain

17:39.267 --> 17:40.976
on the bloodline,

17:41.185 --> 17:42.936
something to erase.

17:46.649 --> 17:49.568
Then screw them.

17:49.777 --> 17:50.861
I wouldn't cover
it up.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.572
I think it's
pretty badass.

17:53.781 --> 17:55.032
Liar.

18:02.457 --> 18:04.041
Get back!
I said get back.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.835
Here we go. Come on.
Like we talked about!

18:07.045 --> 18:08.003
Link up!

18:13.342 --> 18:14.092
This one.

18:14.302 --> 18:15.177
All right. Let's go.

18:15.386 --> 18:16.303
Everybody now!

18:16.512 --> 18:17.846
Clear the way!

18:20.016 --> 18:21.683
Aah!

18:21.893 --> 18:22.768
Hey!

18:22.977 --> 18:23.977
Let go of me!

18:24.187 --> 18:25.604
Are you trying to
get yourself killed?

18:25.813 --> 18:26.772
Bellamy?

18:26.981 --> 18:27.898
Just shut up
and listen.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.399
They're killing them.

18:29.609 --> 18:30.692
Next time they come,
you have to fight back

18:30.902 --> 18:32.694
harder than this,
do you understand?

18:32.904 --> 18:34.404
Here. Take this.

18:34.614 --> 18:35.530
Get everyone ready.

18:35.740 --> 18:36.698
Ready for what?
What's the plan?

18:36.908 --> 18:38.325
I'm working on it.

18:38.534 --> 18:41.078
Find Dante.
He's on our side. He'll help us.

18:41.287 --> 18:42.204
OK.

18:42.413 --> 18:44.122
Hey! Everything
OK over there?

18:44.332 --> 18:45.207
Yes, sir.

18:45.416 --> 18:47.834
Unh!

18:50.505 --> 18:52.464
Help!

18:52.673 --> 18:54.424
Please, somebody. No!

19:17.532 --> 19:20.033
Your evening meal,
president Wallace.

19:41.848 --> 19:42.973
Who are you?

19:43.182 --> 19:44.724
Jasper sent me.

19:44.934 --> 19:45.934
We need your help.

19:46.144 --> 19:49.688
Your son is killing
my friends.

19:49.897 --> 19:53.316
I'm a prisoner,
same as them.

19:53.526 --> 19:56.236
A prisoner who knows
every inch of this Mountain,

19:56.445 --> 19:58.238
every security measure.

20:03.369 --> 20:05.120
Who's helping you?

20:05.329 --> 20:08.248
That's not important
right now.

20:08.457 --> 20:10.625
After Clarke escaped,

20:10.835 --> 20:12.961
I had all exits
fortified

20:13.171 --> 20:15.255
and put under
extra surveillance.

20:15.464 --> 20:17.424
My son has no doubt
changed

20:17.633 --> 20:20.427
all access and entrance
codes by now.

20:20.636 --> 20:24.723
Your friends will never
even make it off of level 5.

20:24.932 --> 20:27.309
I won't let them
die here.

20:27.518 --> 20:32.355
I'm sorry. I can't
help them escape.

20:37.028 --> 20:40.906
But I may be able
to buy them some time.

20:41.115 --> 20:42.199
Hyah! Hyah!

20:58.257 --> 20:59.925
Clarke,
you made it.

21:00.134 --> 21:01.968
I need you to take me
to Lexa.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.388
What's wrong?

21:05.598 --> 21:06.806
Nothing.

21:08.643 --> 21:10.393
Is Bellamy ready?

21:10.603 --> 21:11.895
Did he get
the acid fog down?

21:12.104 --> 21:13.813
He's working on it.

21:20.821 --> 21:22.030
Whitman
to Mount Weather command.

21:22.240 --> 21:23.907
Final target has landed.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.325
All targets
accounted for.

21:25.534 --> 21:26.701
Copy that.

21:26.911 --> 21:30.288
Standing by
for the president.

21:30.498 --> 21:32.082
Clarke of
the sky people has

21:32.291 --> 21:33.833
honored us
with her presence.

21:34.043 --> 21:35.919
I'm sorry I'm late,
commander.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.212
You made good time.

21:37.421 --> 21:39.547
I assume the kids
at Mount Weather are OK.

21:39.757 --> 21:41.341
For now.

21:41.550 --> 21:44.469
Can we talk
in private?

21:44.679 --> 21:47.347
Yes. This way.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.360
A missile?
You're sure?

22:00.569 --> 22:04.239
Yes. We have to start
evacuating now.

22:04.448 --> 22:05.407
No.

22:05.616 --> 22:06.783
What do you mean
no, Lexa?

22:06.993 --> 22:08.243
If we evacuate,
they'll know we have

22:08.452 --> 22:09.661
a spy
inside their walls.

22:09.870 --> 22:11.329
Not necessarily.

22:11.539 --> 22:14.291
We can't risk it.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.251
What's the point
of having an inside man

22:16.460 --> 22:18.378
if we can't act
on what he tells us?

22:18.587 --> 22:20.130
Is the acid fog
disabled?

22:20.339 --> 22:23.300
Is our sleeping army
uncaged?

22:23.509 --> 22:25.885
Then Bellamy's job
is not done.

22:26.095 --> 22:28.471
Without him, we can't
win this war.

22:28.681 --> 22:30.557
So what are you saying?

22:30.766 --> 22:32.559
We just do nothing,

22:32.768 --> 22:36.021
let them bomb us?

22:36.230 --> 22:39.691
It will be a blow,

22:39.900 --> 22:42.485
but our army will be
safe inside the woods,

22:42.695 --> 22:45.530
and it will
inspire them.

22:45.740 --> 22:47.073
And what about us?

22:47.283 --> 22:50.744
We slip away
right now.

22:50.953 --> 22:51.995
Put this on.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.540
Lexa, wait.
You don't understand.

22:55.750 --> 22:57.334
I provoked Mount Weather.

22:57.543 --> 22:59.586
I sent a message to distract
them from Bellamy.

22:59.795 --> 23:02.630
Clarke, sometimes, you have to
concede a battle to win a war.

23:02.840 --> 23:06.092
No. We can inform
the leaders of the clans,

23:06.302 --> 23:08.803
pick a rendezvous
point in the woods.

23:09.013 --> 23:10.138
Each of them can
slip out separately.

23:10.348 --> 23:13.016
And how many more people
will they tell?

23:13.225 --> 23:14.517
Where do we draw
the line?

23:14.727 --> 23:16.227
Well, then cancel
the meeting,

23:16.437 --> 23:17.896
start a fire, something!

23:18.105 --> 23:19.397
Clarke, we don't have
time for this.

23:19.607 --> 23:20.732
No, no!

23:20.941 --> 23:22.442
This is wrong!

23:25.571 --> 23:29.199
It's also our only choice,
and you know it.

23:29.408 --> 23:30.909
You could have warned
everyone up there,

23:31.118 --> 23:32.494
but you didn't.

23:32.703 --> 23:35.455
You said nothing,
not even to your own people.

23:37.750 --> 23:42.045
This is war, Clarke.
People die.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.839
You showed true
strength today.

23:45.049 --> 23:47.008
Don't let emotions
stop you now.

23:49.261 --> 23:50.970
It's time to go.

24:17.206 --> 24:18.706
Chancellor, look out!

24:21.168 --> 24:22.669
Hold your fire!

24:22.878 --> 24:23.837
Wait! Whoa, whoa.

24:24.046 --> 24:25.046
Everybody
put your weapons

24:25.256 --> 24:26.214
and supplies
in the cart,

24:26.424 --> 24:28.091
and nobody
gets hurt.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.467
If we give you our supplies,
we'll all die out here.

24:29.677 --> 24:33.555
If you don't,
you'll die right here.

24:38.352 --> 24:39.519
Do as she says.

24:39.728 --> 24:40.937
Now!

24:47.111 --> 24:48.570
How's your faith
holding up, chancellor?

24:48.779 --> 24:49.904
Shut up.

24:50.114 --> 24:51.364
Unwavering.

24:55.161 --> 24:56.619
You don't want
to do this.

24:56.829 --> 24:58.079
Stop walking!

24:58.289 --> 25:00.081
We all came out here
searching for a better life,

25:00.291 --> 25:01.458
same as you.

25:01.667 --> 25:03.751
Maybe we can find it

25:03.961 --> 25:05.795
if we work together.

25:06.005 --> 25:08.590
Thanks...

25:08.799 --> 25:09.924
But no.

25:11.510 --> 25:14.220
Now, everyone, back away
from the cart

25:14.430 --> 25:16.473
and get
on your knees.

25:16.682 --> 25:17.557
Now!

25:17.766 --> 25:18.892
Do what she says.

25:22.396 --> 25:23.646
You, too.

25:30.529 --> 25:33.865
Oh, what a surprise.
You're just like everyone else.

25:36.660 --> 25:38.244
Good luck, John.

25:42.416 --> 25:44.792
Talk to me. What do you see?

25:45.002 --> 25:45.960
Close your eyes.

25:46.170 --> 25:47.670
Imagine
a bottomless pit.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.130
Just stick with it.

25:49.340 --> 25:50.423
According to Dante's
coordinates,

25:50.633 --> 25:51.633
you're almost there.

25:51.842 --> 25:52.926
What's happening
on your end?

25:53.135 --> 25:54.844
Did they evacuate
Tondc?

25:55.054 --> 25:56.262
Don't know yet,
but it's Clarke.

25:56.472 --> 25:58.264
She'll get it done.

25:58.474 --> 25:59.974
Just concentrate on squeezing
your ass through that vent

26:00.184 --> 26:01.851
and stop worrying
about your sister.

26:06.482 --> 26:08.775
Octavia's in Tondc?

26:08.984 --> 26:11.236
She's there?

26:11.445 --> 26:13.404
Raven.

26:13.614 --> 26:15.240
She's gonna be OK.

26:15.449 --> 26:16.449
Clarke fired out
of here.

26:16.659 --> 26:18.618
She's gonna get
there on time.

26:18.827 --> 26:21.037
How could you keep
this from me?

26:21.247 --> 26:24.332
Clarke was trying
to protect you.

26:24.542 --> 26:26.709
Listen. You still have
a job to do.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.503
I know you're worried
about Octavia,

26:28.712 --> 26:29.796
but you have to focus.

26:36.470 --> 26:39.681
Let's just get this done.

26:44.186 --> 26:45.687
Should be
at the meeting,

26:45.896 --> 26:48.648
not watching
the trees with you.

26:50.317 --> 26:52.694
Quiet. There's
someone out there.

26:58.659 --> 27:00.743
This one's mine,
sky girl.

27:09.670 --> 27:10.670
Atohl?

27:41.493 --> 27:42.702
Lincoln?

27:46.332 --> 27:47.457
What are you doing?

27:51.295 --> 27:53.254
Get away from him.

27:53.464 --> 27:56.257
Gah! I said get
away from him!

28:00.846 --> 28:04.140
You don't
understand.

28:04.350 --> 28:05.683
I can't fight it.

28:05.893 --> 28:09.020
Yes, you can.
We can.

28:09.229 --> 28:11.648
I betrayed
your brother.

28:11.857 --> 28:14.776
He's a prisoner in the Mountain
because of me.

28:14.985 --> 28:17.779
Lincoln, I don't know
what happened between you two,

28:17.988 --> 28:20.490
but Bellamy made it,
he's fine.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.325
We've got our inside man.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.535
Now I need you
to come with me.

28:29.833 --> 28:30.833
Unh!

28:35.047 --> 28:37.131
Grounders don't
give up.

28:37.341 --> 28:38.841
We fight.

28:39.051 --> 28:41.636
Either you get up
and we fight this,

28:41.845 --> 28:47.058
or you crawl away
and die alone like a coward.

28:47.267 --> 28:48.601
It's your choice.

28:56.735 --> 28:59.153
John.

28:59.363 --> 29:00.822
Come on.
We got to go.

29:03.158 --> 29:04.659
There.
He's up. It's about time.

29:04.868 --> 29:06.452
Quiet, Caspian.

29:06.662 --> 29:08.746
You all right?

29:08.956 --> 29:10.498
If he's not,
we're leaving him here.

29:10.708 --> 29:11.582
I'm OK.

29:11.792 --> 29:12.917
It's time to go home.

29:17.131 --> 29:19.132
And where exactly
is that?

29:21.802 --> 29:24.804
Sir, I know you're trying to
take us to a better place,

29:25.013 --> 29:26.055
but look around.

29:26.265 --> 29:28.141
We've got no food,
we've got no water,

29:28.350 --> 29:30.935
and no idea
how to find it.

29:31.145 --> 29:32.854
Due north.

29:33.063 --> 29:35.022
She said due north.

29:35.232 --> 29:37.400
What is due north,
John?

29:37.609 --> 29:41.070
She was talking about
the city of light.

29:41.280 --> 29:42.572
Did she say that?

29:42.781 --> 29:43.948
No.

29:47.453 --> 29:52.415
Did she say
how far due north?

29:52.624 --> 29:55.501
No. She didn't, but she
wouldn't be sending us there

29:55.711 --> 29:57.003
if we couldn't
make it.

29:57.212 --> 29:58.254
Who's that?
The liar and the thief

29:58.464 --> 30:02.049
who robbed us
and knocked you out?

30:02.259 --> 30:05.428
Sir, I really hope you
are not considering this.

30:05.637 --> 30:09.098
John, we have no weapons
and no rations.

30:09.308 --> 30:11.350
If we go north
and you're wrong,

30:11.560 --> 30:13.770
then all of us will die.

30:13.979 --> 30:18.065
If we turn back now,
we live.

30:18.275 --> 30:20.193
So that's it?

30:20.402 --> 30:21.736
We've reached
the point of no return?

30:21.945 --> 30:22.862
You just want to
give up?

30:23.071 --> 30:24.071
I didn't say that.

30:24.281 --> 30:25.573
You didn't not
say it either.

30:29.870 --> 30:32.288
That is the north star.

30:34.792 --> 30:36.083
After you.

30:43.592 --> 30:46.594
The rest of you need
to decide for yourselves,

30:46.804 --> 30:48.513
but either way,
we'll come back for you

30:48.722 --> 30:49.847
when we find it.

30:50.057 --> 30:52.141
Sir, this is
a mistake.

30:52.351 --> 30:54.685
You're not gonna find it,
you're not gonna make it.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.566
I believe...

31:00.776 --> 31:04.320
This is what they call
having faith, John.

31:04.530 --> 31:07.031
Faith?

31:07.241 --> 31:09.617
Nah. Just have
nothing better to do.

31:23.340 --> 31:25.216
Pal needs your
auth code, sir.

31:32.558 --> 31:34.100
OK.
Activated.

31:34.309 --> 31:36.185
She's live.

31:36.395 --> 31:38.855
Whitman, are you
in position? Over.

31:39.064 --> 31:40.189
Affirmative, sir.

31:40.399 --> 31:42.859
Generating target
coordinates now. Over.

31:51.577 --> 31:52.535
Clarke, we have
to keep moving.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.537
We're not
far enough away.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.330
The last time they
used a missile,

31:56.540 --> 31:57.832
it was
before I was born.

31:58.041 --> 31:59.417
According to legend,
it left a hole in the woods

31:59.626 --> 32:01.168
you could not
see across.

32:01.378 --> 32:02.712
Now let's go.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.589
What if we made
them miss?

32:04.798 --> 32:05.923
You're not listening.

32:06.133 --> 32:08.426
With a weapon like that,
you can't miss.

32:08.635 --> 32:11.554
Yes, you can. I heard them talking
about a spotter,

32:11.763 --> 32:13.389
someone in the field
to aim the missile.

32:13.599 --> 32:15.641
If we could just
find him.

32:18.604 --> 32:21.856
No. What's she
doing here?

32:22.065 --> 32:24.066
Clarke, you can't
go back.

32:24.276 --> 32:25.484
Clarke!

32:27.988 --> 32:33.451
North 38 degrees,
54 minutes, .25 seconds.

32:33.660 --> 32:34.619
Copy.

32:34.828 --> 32:36.037
By west 77 degrees,

32:36.246 --> 32:38.164
2 minutes, .12 seconds.

32:38.373 --> 32:39.290
Over.

32:41.793 --> 32:44.003
We're locked in.

32:44.212 --> 32:45.463
Standing by
for confirmation.

32:49.718 --> 32:51.218
Mom, what are you
doing here?

32:51.428 --> 32:52.386
I told you to stay
back at camp.

32:52.596 --> 32:54.055
Enough, Clarke.
I'm the chancellor.

32:54.264 --> 32:55.473
I don't need your
permission to go--

32:55.682 --> 32:57.308
No. We have to
leave now.

32:57.517 --> 32:58.726
What is going on?

32:58.936 --> 33:00.353
We can't be here.

33:00.562 --> 33:05.024
Mom, I am begging
you. Please.

33:05.233 --> 33:06.400
Come on.

33:13.700 --> 33:15.576
Where's the commander?
Where's Clarke?

33:15.786 --> 33:17.453
I don't know.

33:17.663 --> 33:19.956
Last time I saw them,
they were heading downstairs.

33:20.165 --> 33:21.832
They're not there now.

33:26.088 --> 33:27.380
We should search
the woods.

33:27.589 --> 33:28.547
I agree.

33:30.175 --> 33:31.634
I'll tell the others.

33:36.264 --> 33:37.515
Final targets confirmed.

33:37.724 --> 33:39.392
We are go for launch.

33:40.769 --> 33:42.395
On your command, sir.

33:44.898 --> 33:45.856
Fire.

33:52.656 --> 33:53.698
Bird is in the air.

33:53.907 --> 33:56.492
Impact in 10, 9...

33:56.702 --> 33:57.785
Wait!

33:57.995 --> 33:59.787
No. We can't stop.
There's no time.

33:59.997 --> 34:01.122
I am not taking
a step further

34:01.331 --> 34:02.164
until you tell me
what is happening.

34:04.167 --> 34:07.086
5, 4, 3,

34:07.295 --> 34:08.963
2, 1.

34:28.608 --> 34:31.235
Mom.

34:31.445 --> 34:34.572
Mom, are you OK?

34:34.781 --> 34:38.284
Oh, my God.

34:38.493 --> 34:40.870
Come on.
We can't be here.

34:41.079 --> 34:42.788
We--we have to go.

34:46.251 --> 34:47.460
You knew.

34:50.547 --> 34:53.007
You knew, and you
let this happen?

34:53.216 --> 34:57.178
We had no choice.

34:57.387 --> 35:00.598
So many people.

35:00.807 --> 35:02.016
Our people.

35:02.225 --> 35:04.643
No. We had to
protect Bellamy.

35:04.853 --> 35:06.187
Without him--

35:06.396 --> 35:07.313
Oh, stop it!

35:07.522 --> 35:09.398
I don't want
to hear it.

35:09.608 --> 35:11.233
Mom...

35:11.443 --> 35:13.486
Tell me this
was Lexa.

35:13.695 --> 35:16.572
Please, Clarke.

35:16.782 --> 35:19.784
Please tell me
this wasn't you.

35:19.993 --> 35:21.410
I wish I could.

35:24.790 --> 35:26.540
You can't tell
anyone about this.

35:26.750 --> 35:28.626
If anyone finds out
that we knew,

35:28.835 --> 35:31.253
the alliance
of the 12 clans will break.

35:31.463 --> 35:34.840
We'll lose the war.

35:35.050 --> 35:36.383
You crossed
the line.

35:36.593 --> 35:37.551
Mom.

35:37.761 --> 35:39.303
Their blood is
on your hands,

35:39.513 --> 35:41.597
and even if we win,

35:41.807 --> 35:47.144
I'm afraid you won't
be able to wash it off this time.

35:47.354 --> 35:48.437
Don't worry.

35:48.647 --> 35:52.066
Your secret is
safe with me.

35:52.275 --> 35:53.943
Mom... Wait.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.152
Mom!

36:04.121 --> 36:05.955
What's taking
Bellamy so long?

36:06.164 --> 36:07.248
I don't know.

36:07.457 --> 36:08.666
Maybe they caught him.

36:08.875 --> 36:11.460
No. He'll figure
a way out, I know he will.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.170
Jasper, it's already
been 4 hours.

36:13.380 --> 36:14.296
The guards will be
back any second.

36:14.506 --> 36:15.673
They're gonna take
someone else.

36:15.882 --> 36:18.968
No. Listen to me.

36:19.177 --> 36:22.680
Everyone, we stick
to the plan.

36:22.889 --> 36:24.140
They're not taking
anyone else

36:24.349 --> 36:25.975
out of this room
without a fight!

36:27.352 --> 36:28.435
Get ready.

36:30.981 --> 36:32.189
Disperse.

36:39.573 --> 36:40.406
This one.

36:40.615 --> 36:41.657
Yes, ma'am.

36:41.867 --> 36:44.076
No! No! No!

36:44.286 --> 36:45.995
Hey! Get your
hands off him!

37:00.177 --> 37:01.969
- Enough!
- Don't move!

37:07.684 --> 37:09.226
Take him instead.

37:09.436 --> 37:10.769
No, you can't!

37:10.979 --> 37:11.937
Get up.

37:12.147 --> 37:13.731
No!

37:13.940 --> 37:15.691
Jasper! Not Jasper!

37:17.569 --> 37:19.278
Search the rest.

37:19.487 --> 37:21.655
Make sure there are
no other weapons.

37:21.865 --> 37:24.450
Yes, ma'am.
You heard her. Let's go!

37:26.077 --> 37:27.536
As soon as we're
in the lab,

37:27.746 --> 37:28.829
I want him prepped.

37:29.039 --> 37:30.372
We start immediately.

37:30.582 --> 37:33.417
Copy that. Transporting
asset, elevator "C."

37:39.174 --> 37:41.800
Ugh. Something's wrong.

37:42.010 --> 37:44.720
Unh! Radiation.

37:44.930 --> 37:45.971
We need to get
out of here.

37:46.181 --> 37:48.682
My skin!

37:48.892 --> 37:51.268
Containment breach
level 5.

37:51.478 --> 37:52.686
Seal the whole
floor.

37:54.689 --> 37:56.607
Bellamy.

37:56.816 --> 37:58.275
You got to pull the outside air in

37:58.485 --> 38:01.528
to reverse
the air filtration system.

38:01.738 --> 38:03.822
Just tell me how we know
if it's even working.

38:04.032 --> 38:06.075
Containment breach.

38:06.284 --> 38:08.202
I'd say it's working.

38:08.411 --> 38:10.996
Thank you,
Mr. president.

38:11.206 --> 38:12.539
Let's go!
This is our chance!

38:12.749 --> 38:13.874
Everybody move!

38:14.084 --> 38:15.084
Take the level!

38:15.293 --> 38:16.126
Monty, get the cameras.

38:16.336 --> 38:17.711
Miller, get their guns.

38:17.921 --> 38:18.921
Go!

38:28.014 --> 38:31.392
No. You can't.

38:31.601 --> 38:34.645
I hope you know that you're
incredibly special to us.

38:57.502 --> 38:58.919
Who helped them?

39:01.589 --> 39:03.173
Who helped them?

39:05.051 --> 39:08.304
I don't know what
you're talking about.

39:08.513 --> 39:10.180
You still have
influence,

39:10.390 --> 39:12.349
people who believe
in you,

39:12.559 --> 39:16.854
and one of them
irradiated level 5 today.

39:17.063 --> 39:20.316
I want to know
who it is.

39:20.525 --> 39:22.067
It was me.

39:25.655 --> 39:29.325
Well, you and whoever
helped you

39:29.534 --> 39:32.828
killed 11
of our people today,

39:33.038 --> 39:34.580
and for what?

39:34.789 --> 39:37.458
We're gonna retake
their level soon enough.

39:37.667 --> 39:41.003
Get out
of my sight, Cage.

39:46.885 --> 39:48.635
I know we disagree...

39:52.140 --> 39:55.017
But this will all
be over soon.

39:55.226 --> 39:59.104
I bombed Tondc today.

40:04.110 --> 40:08.781
My father installed that silo
to protect us, Cage.

40:08.990 --> 40:14.495
Why can't you see that that is
exactly what I'm trying to do?

40:14.704 --> 40:17.331
With Clarke
and the commander dead,

40:17.540 --> 40:20.167
the savages can go back
to killing each other,

40:20.377 --> 40:22.419
and then we can retake
the ground.

40:22.629 --> 40:26.256
And it only cost you
your souls!

40:33.390 --> 40:35.682
He's ready.

40:35.892 --> 40:37.017
What are you doing?

40:37.227 --> 40:38.018
Freeing you.

40:38.228 --> 40:39.478
Restrain him.

40:39.687 --> 40:41.647
Easy, easy.
Do not hurt him.

40:54.577 --> 40:57.037
The marrow kicks in
in 48 hours.

41:03.336 --> 41:05.087
You'll thank me
someday.
