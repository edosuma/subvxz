03:29.709 --> 03:33.346
I say that 'cause that's how my dad treated her.

03:33.346 --> 03:35.515
My dad was one of the biggest party promoters

04:47.287 --> 04:49.956
(siren wailing)

05:12.812 --> 05:15.481
(ambient music)

05:21.554 --> 05:24.724
(bright upbeat music)

05:36.069 --> 05:37.837
- Detroit, good morning.

05:37.837 --> 05:39.539
It's your boy, Nick Money,

05:39.539 --> 05:41.941
and I'm talking that cash on What's Real Radio.

05:41.941 --> 05:44.844
Listen, I got your chance to win these Kodak Black tickets,

05:44.844 --> 05:46.079
May 14th.

Wake up, then call me. (313) 298-1075.

05:50.483 --> 05:54.787
Until then, man, I got some of that Lil Baby, (indistinct).

05:54.787 --> 05:57.924
- [Bobby] This is Detroit, the land of the haters,

05:57.924 --> 06:02.595
and have-nots, with the core fabric of a hustler,

06:02.595 --> 06:04.297
if you're built right.

06:04.297 --> 06:08.234
- Call and talk to me, (313) 298-1075.

06:08.234 --> 06:10.870
Don't forget I got some of that Lil Baby, ().

06:10.870 --> 06:13.072
And of course, Detroit's own, Marsh.

06:13.072 --> 06:14.807
Hey, shout out Bobby, man.

06:14.807 --> 06:16.876
Cooper Street Records, I see y'all, man.

06:16.876 --> 06:18.544
We are Detroit, man.

06:18.544 --> 06:20.046
What's Real Radio.

06:20.046 --> 06:24.117
- [Bobby] They say the only way to make it out of Detroit

06:24.117 --> 06:28.121
is with a big ass gun, and a bigger bag of dope.

06:31.624 --> 06:34.160
I didn't graduate from Cass Tech,

06:34.160 --> 06:36.963
or get a scholarship at Wayne State.

06:36.963 --> 06:40.199
But I always had the mind of a hustler,

06:41.300 --> 06:43.136
mind of a businessman.

06:44.771 --> 06:46.706
For some, it was drugs.

06:47.940 --> 06:51.411
But for me, it was parties like my father,

06:51.411 --> 06:53.479
then it came to music.

06:53.479 --> 06:56.449
I've been in this music game for five years

06:56.449 --> 06:58.551
managing every little upcoming group.

06:58.551 --> 07:01.053
(upbeat music)

07:15.067 --> 07:17.003
- Y'all better stop motherfucking playing with me

07:17.003 --> 07:22.008

07:23.142 --> 07:24.811
- What the fuck is y'all in here doing, man?

07:24.811 --> 07:25.745
- I'm working.

07:25.745 --> 07:27.246
This nigga always asleep.

07:27.246 --> 07:29.482
- Man, y'all supposed to be in here making music, man.

07:29.482 --> 07:30.983
- Man, these motherfuckers won't stop fucking with me.

07:30.983 --> 07:34.687
- [Bobby] People think being the manager is easy money,

07:34.687 --> 07:37.323
but it's far from the truth.

07:37.323 --> 07:40.460
You have to be their parent, their bookkeeper,

07:40.460 --> 07:43.329
even their supplier sometimes.

07:43.329 --> 07:44.564
Look at that drive here,

07:44.564 --> 07:45.798
that's the only thing I fuck with.

07:45.798 --> 07:48.401
(indistinct), you're gonna make a hit.

07:48.401 --> 07:49.869
- This is all I know.

07:49.869 --> 07:51.003
- What is you saying?

07:51.003 --> 07:52.905
Why you keep blowing my phone up?

07:52.905 --> 07:54.173
(indistinct)

07:54.173 --> 07:57.076
I'm your fucking manager, not your daddy.

07:57.076 --> 07:58.878
I'm not gonna be paying your fucking phone bill.

07:58.878 --> 07:59.946
You a grown ass man.

07:59.946 --> 08:01.180
Go pay your own fucking phone.

08:01.180 --> 08:03.049
What the fuck is you niggas out here doing?

08:03.049 --> 08:05.384
- Damn, Bobby. Where the fuck you been at nigga?

08:05.384 --> 08:07.820
We ain't see your ass in damn near six months.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.755
- No, for real, 'cause how the fuck you let them whores

08:09.755 --> 08:11.023
drop before us?

08:11.023 --> 08:12.325
- You got us fucked up.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.494
- Like we ain't been recording the recording.

08:14.494 --> 08:17.597
You got this butch ass DJ not spinning our shit,

08:17.597 --> 08:19.465

08:19.465 --> 08:20.733
- We supposed to been drop the record.

08:20.733 --> 08:23.569
- And I'm tired as fuck.

08:23.569 --> 08:26.205
- How the hell are y'all supposed to put anything out?

08:26.205 --> 08:28.007
I mean, your ass out the country every different week

08:28.007 --> 08:29.275
with a different nigga.

08:29.275 --> 08:30.776
I'm watching your fucking Instagram.

08:30.776 --> 08:33.312
And you keep sitting up here and getting pregnant.

08:33.312 --> 08:35.081
- We still can release music, nigga.

08:35.081 --> 08:36.782
- We still lit.

08:36.782 --> 08:37.683

08:39.452 --> 08:41.020
- Well, get y'all little ass in the studio.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.388
That's what y'all need to do.

08:42.388 --> 08:43.689
- Nigga, fuck you.

08:43.689 --> 08:46.259
(upbeat music)

08:48.528 --> 08:49.729
- Make it tenfold, nigga.

08:49.729 --> 08:52.832
- [Bobby] Now with more flyer, more cooler,

08:52.832 --> 08:55.735
and definitely more stubborn than Flight ass.

08:55.735 --> 08:59.705
One arm in the rap game, two legs in the streets.

08:59.705 --> 09:02.708
(indistinct chatter)

09:30.136 --> 09:32.638
(tense music)

09:39.512 --> 09:40.446
(door banging)

09:40.446 --> 09:41.847
- Get on the fucking ground.

09:41.847 --> 09:44.951
(indistinct chatter)

09:52.792 --> 09:53.726
- [Police] Put your hands behind your back.

09:53.726 --> 09:56.329
Put your hands behind your back.

09:57.430 --> 09:58.864

10:19.485 --> 10:21.854
And Flight about to get out just in a minute.

10:21.854 --> 10:24.890
- Bobby, I need some adhesive.

10:24.890 --> 10:27.226
This tape ain't working.

10:27.226 --> 10:29.128
- Man, make it work, man.

10:29.128 --> 10:30.630
- It ain't sticking, man.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.231

10:32.231 --> 10:35.101

10:35.101 --> 10:36.602
I need you to take care of that shit, man.

10:36.602 --> 10:38.537

31:54.245 --> 31:55.580
You know I like my shit to fit.

31:55.580 --> 31:56.848

31:56.848 --> 31:58.549
Stop complaining all the fucking time.

31:58.549 --> 31:59.350
Let's go.

32:00.752 --> 32:03.021

32:03.021 --> 32:05.924

32:09.327 --> 32:10.528

And we got Flight in the building.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.439

32:21.439 --> 32:23.074
Flight got the number one record right now in Detroit.

32:23.074 --> 32:24.075
You feel me?

32:25.243 --> 32:27.645
Yeah, Detroit Dreams, the record going crazy.

32:27.645 --> 32:29.180
Yo Bobby, you got something to say, dawg?

32:29.180 --> 32:32.750
'Cause y'all are going crazy right now.

32:32.750 --> 32:34.552
- Yeah, I got something to say.

32:34.552 --> 32:36.721
I'm an ambassador for the city.

32:36.721 --> 32:38.323
And I think Detroit deserves this recognition

32:38.323 --> 32:39.891
that we getting now.

32:39.891 --> 32:41.559
I've been trying to put on for the city,

32:41.559 --> 32:44.662
and do the things that we supposed to been doing.

32:44.662 --> 32:47.298
But we appreciate all the love we've been getting

32:47.298 --> 32:48.266

32:48.266 --> 32:50.234
Let's keep turning up.

32:50.234 --> 32:51.102
Let's go, Flight.

32:51.102 --> 32:54.038

32:54.038 --> 32:55.640
(indistinct)

32:55.640 --> 32:58.209
(upbeat music)

33:25.269 --> 33:26.437
- I see you working.

33:26.437 --> 33:27.905
That's what I be talking about, Bobby.

33:27.905 --> 33:32.043
- I'm trying, but I can't remember everybody birthdays,

33:32.043 --> 33:33.678
but that shit coming through though.

33:33.678 --> 33:34.946
- Now, listen.

33:34.946 --> 33:37.215
I may have a way we can scratch each other back.

33:37.215 --> 33:40.585
The label trying to sign a dude from Detroit.

33:40.585 --> 33:42.587
I'm thinking about pitching Boyz ENT.

33:42.587 --> 33:43.755
- Oh yeah?

33:43.755 --> 33:45.390
That's major.

33:45.390 --> 33:46.624
Congratulations.

33:46.624 --> 33:47.859
- So they gave me a big bag to work with,

33:47.859 --> 33:49.794
but this shit for real.

33:50.795 --> 33:52.764
But Boyz got the record.

33:52.764 --> 33:55.366
Put flight on it, it's a win-win for both of us.

33:55.366 --> 33:56.734
- I don't know though.

33:56.734 --> 33:58.870
They're sound don't really mix.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.338
- Mix?

34:00.338 --> 34:01.839
Check this out.

34:01.839 --> 34:05.410
I guarantee you, if you get Flight on that remix,

34:05.410 --> 34:08.112
he'll be the headliner opener for the Kodak black show

34:08.112 --> 34:10.148
next month, guarantee you.

34:10.148 --> 34:11.783
- Damn.

34:11.783 --> 34:14.118
I been reaching out to the promoters like crazy.

34:14.118 --> 34:15.553
- Boyz been in my pocket.

34:15.553 --> 34:19.490
- Boyz ENT, man, they're like my people too, for real.

34:19.490 --> 34:21.426
You gotta make that shit make sense.

34:21.426 --> 34:23.528
- You make it make sense.

34:28.099 --> 34:29.834
- Mont, man, I need that money, man.

34:29.834 --> 34:31.702
I don't even know why Rufus plugged me and you together,

34:31.702 --> 34:34.172
man, if you was gonna be on some shit like this, man.

34:34.172 --> 34:36.441
I need the other part of that money, man.

34:36.441 --> 34:37.675
You don't see what's going on?

34:37.675 --> 34:38.876
You ain't listening to the radio station,

34:38.876 --> 34:40.178
our music everywhere.

34:40.178 --> 34:41.846
I need the other part of that money, man.

34:41.846 --> 34:43.448
Get back with me ASAP.

34:43.448 --> 34:44.348
Come on, Mont.

34:44.348 --> 34:46.851
(tense music)

34:58.229 --> 34:59.163
What's up, Rufus?

34:59.163 --> 35:00.965
You fuck with the spread today?

35:00.965 --> 35:02.967
- Nah, nah, not today, man.

35:02.967 --> 35:05.770
I wasn't even feeling it.

35:05.770 --> 35:07.105
- You ain't talked to your man's Mont?

35:07.105 --> 35:08.739
You ain't seen him.

35:08.739 --> 35:10.975
- I ain't seen him in a minute, Bobby.

35:10.975 --> 35:15.513
- Well, I need you to holler at him about that deal we did.

35:15.513 --> 35:19.851
Can't just be walking out on the middle of the play.

35:21.786 --> 35:23.754
- Hey, Bo, do me a favor, man.

35:23.754 --> 35:25.957
Go on the back and gamble just for a second.

35:25.957 --> 35:26.958
- All right.

35:28.526 --> 35:31.028
- One second, man. One second.

35:32.563 --> 35:36.467
- Nigga just walking out on the play like that.

35:40.271 --> 35:42.073
- Listen Bobby, man.

35:42.073 --> 35:46.077
I'm sorry I got you tied up in this bullshit with Mont.

35:46.077 --> 35:50.047
But I suggest whatever you got going on bro,

35:50.047 --> 35:53.017
just leave the shit alone, man.

35:53.017 --> 35:53.851
- How?

35:55.186 --> 35:56.654
When I signed the contract with this nigga,

35:56.654 --> 35:59.056
I gave him 50% of my company.

35:59.056 --> 36:00.625
That ain't how business work.

36:00.625 --> 36:03.461
- Bobby, Mont ain't business.

36:03.461 --> 36:05.196
The nigga street.

36:05.196 --> 36:08.432
And right now they coming down on him harder than ever.

36:08.432 --> 36:11.369
All I'm saying is, whatever you was doing before you met

36:11.369 --> 36:14.639
the nigga, just go back to doing that shit.

36:14.639 --> 36:18.009
- Can't do that, not with him owning 50% of my label.

36:18.009 --> 36:19.911
We're gonna have to go to court about that shit.

36:19.911 --> 36:21.078
- What the fuck is you...

36:21.078 --> 36:24.549
Listen, somebody telling on Mont, man.

36:24.549 --> 36:26.417
That's why he been out the way.

36:26.417 --> 36:27.618
Look, whatever you do,

36:27.618 --> 36:31.489
do not mention court around this nigga, man.

36:31.489 --> 36:34.992
He a old school nigga, he gets spooked about shit like that.

36:34.992 --> 36:36.561
- Man, I don't give a fuck.

36:36.561 --> 36:38.496
That ain't my concern.

36:38.496 --> 36:40.631
That shit ain't got nothing to do with me.

36:40.631 --> 36:42.300
We had an agreement.

36:42.300 --> 36:43.901

37:48.899 --> 37:49.834
Man, there's a lot of shit going on.

37:49.834 --> 37:51.335
You would never understand.

37:51.335 --> 37:54.905
Feds went in my spot, and both my houses.

38:00.144 --> 38:03.147
- What you mean, time for this rap shit, man?

38:03.147 --> 38:05.616
- We gotta figure this shit out another time.

38:05.616 --> 38:06.851
- Listen, Mont.

38:09.153 --> 38:11.555
I got the hottest records going right now.

38:11.555 --> 38:13.758
Nigga, I got these deals on the table.

38:13.758 --> 38:16.627
I ain't got time to be waiting on that second half.

38:16.627 --> 38:18.262
I need that other half of that paperwork, man.

38:18.262 --> 38:21.966
- And I just told you, I'm dealing with real life situation.

38:21.966 --> 38:24.602
We gotta deal with this shit another time, dawg.

38:24.602 --> 38:27.605
- No nigga, we gonna have to dissolve that contract, bro.

38:27.605 --> 38:29.840
Man, nigga I'll see you in court if I have to.

38:29.840 --> 38:32.109
- Court? Contract?

38:32.109 --> 38:33.444
Sounds just like these rat ass niggas

38:33.444 --> 38:34.979

38:36.147 --> 38:37.648

38:40.518 --> 38:42.853

He's snapping on that bitch, I ain't gonna lie.

39:01.138 --> 39:04.508

- Shit, Bobby gave me the contract.

41:06.697 --> 41:08.933
- Man, this some bullshit.

41:08.933 --> 41:11.135
- Bullshit, bullshit how?

41:11.135 --> 41:12.169
What you mean?

41:12.169 --> 41:14.104

41:14.104 --> 41:17.575
You talking about eight years in a deal, two year option.

41:17.575 --> 41:20.044
70/30 splits on the pub.

41:20.044 --> 41:21.278
This is crazy.

41:21.278 --> 41:24.849
You won't get a sandwich till you 60,

41:24.849 --> 41:28.686
and that's if you sell a million records, man.

41:30.254 --> 41:33.524
- Bobby won't do no bullshit like that, bro.

41:33.524 --> 41:35.326
You sure you read that shit correctly?

41:35.326 --> 41:37.561
- Man, listen. (indistinct).

41:37.561 --> 41:40.197
There's a difference between a parasite and a protege.

41:40.197 --> 41:42.066
A parasite want everything you earn,

41:42.066 --> 41:44.468
a protege want what you learn.

41:44.468 --> 41:46.904
I'm getting ready to get back to work, man.

41:46.904 --> 41:47.905
Some bullshit.

42:57.174 --> 43:00.444
This is only gonna buy you a few months.

43:01.879 --> 43:05.249
- I ain't gonna lie, I damn near forgot my court date.

43:05.249 --> 43:07.318
- Forgot your court date.

43:08.485 --> 43:12.289
- I thought Bobby was handling everything.

43:12.289 --> 43:14.058
- You know something?

43:16.293 --> 43:20.264
I only hear from Bobby when he in need.

43:20.264 --> 43:21.932
Right now, it's you.

Detroit Dreams really is like a lifestyle.

44:12.950 --> 44:14.318
You feel me?

44:14.318 --> 44:15.552
You damn near gotta be from here

44:15.552 --> 44:18.022

44:18.022 --> 44:20.691
But, my job is to make people that's not from here

44:20.691 --> 44:22.960
to understand what Detroit Dreams is.

44:22.960 --> 44:24.194
- I get what you're saying.

44:24.194 --> 44:25.896
'Cause Detroit has been under the radar

44:25.896 --> 44:27.798
for a very, very long time.

44:27.798 --> 44:29.533
And its artists like you that are bringing us

44:29.533 --> 44:30.734
back to the forefront.

44:30.734 --> 44:34.505
So tell me, how are you making that happen?

44:43.847 --> 44:45.082
You know what I'm saying?

45:22.886 --> 45:26.790

Nina (indistinct) reporting live

1:05:49.545 --> 1:05:51.714
on the east side of Detroit.

1:05:51.714 --> 1:05:53.816
I'm currently at a restaurant where a shooting

1:05:53.816 --> 1:05:55.384
has just taken place.

1:05:55.384 --> 1:05:58.821
We have one woman dead and others have fled the scene.

1:05:58.821 --> 1:06:01.657
According to sources, I was told this was due to

1:06:01.657 --> 1:06:05.294
after a concert with Flight, the young rapper,

1:06:05.294 --> 1:06:06.996
here in the city of Detroit.

1:06:06.996 --> 1:06:08.764
According to sources, I was told-

1:06:08.764 --> 1:06:09.865
- Ay, yo, yo.

1:06:11.701 --> 1:06:12.902
What the fuck, man.

1:06:12.902 --> 1:06:14.370
You're in this bitch watching TV?

1:06:14.370 --> 1:06:16.439
Can I get my car up in this bitch for 45 minutes?

1:06:16.439 --> 1:06:18.007
- Man, fuck your car.

1:06:18.007 --> 1:06:21.610
- No nigga, fuck you. I'm outta here.

1:06:21.610 --> 1:06:24.947
- Man, it's just another tragedy in the black community.

1:06:24.947 --> 1:06:27.316
I came here to get something to eat.

1:06:27.316 --> 1:06:28.250

1:06:35.224 --> 1:06:36.959

1:06:41.731 --> 1:06:43.299

1:06:43.299 --> 1:06:45.901
- Yes, it is very unfortunate here today.

1:06:45.901 --> 1:06:47.970

Thank you today for telling us what you've seen.

1:06:51.474 --> 1:06:55.578

1:07:22.605 --> 1:07:24.173
That way, thank you.

1:07:24.173 --> 1:07:28.144
- [Bobby] Man, I try to stay low from all the crazy rumors

1:07:28.144 --> 1:07:30.713
and all the shit going on on Instagram.

1:07:30.713 --> 1:07:32.381
But I had to stand up for Flight.

1:07:32.381 --> 1:07:34.583
I know he didn't do it.

1:07:34.583 --> 1:07:36.052
- What's up?

1:07:36.052 --> 1:07:37.920
It's your girl Sierra Jay, the sexiest voice in the city.

1:07:37.920 --> 1:07:42.425
In Detroit I got some piping hot tea for y'all.

1:07:42.425 --> 1:07:44.060
Word on the street is,

1:07:44.060 --> 1:07:46.662
Flight got into a little scuffle last night.

1:07:46.662 --> 1:07:48.564
Well, I wouldn't call it a scuffle y'all,

1:07:48.564 --> 1:07:51.200
because it was a downright shootout,

1:07:51.200 --> 1:07:53.169
and a young lady got killed.

1:07:53.169 --> 1:07:55.438
Now, you know how I feel about that y'all.

1:07:55.438 --> 1:07:56.939
I don't like that type of mess.

1:07:56.939 --> 1:07:59.842
So, I had to bring my boy Bobby in the building.

1:07:59.842 --> 1:08:03.779
So Bobby, why was Flight in that alleyway alone?

1:08:05.915 --> 1:08:07.149
- I don't know.

1:08:07.149 --> 1:08:08.918
- And where was his security at Bobby?

1:08:08.918 --> 1:08:13.489
And the most important question, why weren't you there?

1:08:14.557 --> 1:08:16.225
How did this happen?

1:08:17.660 --> 1:08:19.929
I'm not understanding how you're putting your artists

1:08:19.929 --> 1:08:23.265
in these type of situations to be alone.

1:08:23.265 --> 1:08:25.801
Now we got shootouts, people getting killed.

1:08:25.801 --> 1:08:27.036
Aren't you tired of it?

1:08:27.036 --> 1:08:28.838
So why would you put him in a position,

1:08:28.838 --> 1:08:30.639
leaving him out there alone?

1:08:30.639 --> 1:08:33.776
No security, like literally really, no security.

1:08:33.776 --> 1:08:35.945
This doesn't any type of sense.

1:08:35.945 --> 1:08:38.781
We got babies dying, we got young ladies dying.

1:08:38.781 --> 1:08:40.483
Next, it's gonna be your artist.

1:08:40.483 --> 1:08:42.151
Do you want him to pass away?

1:08:42.151 --> 1:08:43.752
You want situations like Proof?

1:08:43.752 --> 1:08:45.654
You want stuff like that going on?

1:08:45.654 --> 1:08:47.356
I know you're tired, 'cause I'm tired.

1:08:47.356 --> 1:08:49.125
- I couldn't speak.

1:08:49.125 --> 1:08:50.126
I got froze.

1:09:01.070 --> 1:09:03.539
- That's fucked up, Bobby.

1:09:03.539 --> 1:09:04.807
Real fucked up.

1:09:08.010 --> 1:09:10.846
- Wait, I ain't do that shit, man.

1:09:12.181 --> 1:09:15.751
- Bobby, if the press get a hold of this shit,

1:09:15.751 --> 1:09:18.020
they control the narrative.

1:09:21.891 --> 1:09:22.892
- Fuck, man.

1:09:25.594 --> 1:09:28.330
- Bobby, somebody shot this girl.

1:09:29.632 --> 1:09:32.401
And if it was a robbery gone bad,

1:09:34.336 --> 1:09:36.572
they don't have no robbers.

1:09:42.878 --> 1:09:45.781
They don't have no suspects, Bobby.

1:09:47.583 --> 1:09:50.886
I might even get a cop on man slaughter.

1:09:50.886 --> 1:09:54.823
Push this shit back, get the press off our ass.

1:09:55.758 --> 1:09:56.659
Five to 15.

1:09:58.661 --> 1:10:01.330
You can serve four on good time.

1:10:05.167 --> 1:10:07.169
How do you do it, Bobby?

1:10:10.239 --> 1:10:14.677
- To be honest, Blake, I don't know how to feel, man.

1:10:20.616 --> 1:10:23.285
- Bobby, what's really going on?

1:10:32.161 --> 1:10:36.165
- To be honest, man, I got myself into some shit

1:10:37.766 --> 1:10:40.803
I don't know I can't even get out of.

1:10:42.371 --> 1:10:43.172
- Such as?

1:10:45.641 --> 1:10:47.176
- What's up, y'all.

1:10:47.176 --> 1:10:49.912
It's your girl Sierra J, sexiest voice in the city.

1:10:49.912 --> 1:10:53.782
As we all heard, baby girl lost her life this weekend.

1:10:53.782 --> 1:10:56.752
We are going to be holding a special candlelight

1:10:56.752 --> 1:10:58.687
and balloon release for the family.

1:10:58.687 --> 1:11:01.557
Come with your donations, come with your prayers.

1:11:01.557 --> 1:11:04.660
Come whatever you can to make light of the situation y'all.

1:11:04.660 --> 1:11:06.762
We have got to stop the violence.

1:11:06.762 --> 1:11:08.564
So I need y'all to come together.

1:11:08.564 --> 1:11:10.566
Detroit, we gotta do it.

1:11:12.668 --> 1:11:15.070
- On my way right now. I got everything.

1:11:15.070 --> 1:11:18.674
Yes, let me call right back though.

1:11:18.674 --> 1:11:19.908
- Where are you going?

1:11:19.908 --> 1:11:21.744
- Bobby, I gotta get outta Detroit.

1:11:21.744 --> 1:11:23.145
I gotta go.

1:11:23.145 --> 1:11:25.648
- I told you I got this handled, Easter.

1:11:25.648 --> 1:11:27.316
- I killed a man.

1:11:27.316 --> 1:11:29.818
I fucking killed a man.

1:11:29.818 --> 1:11:31.754
- My God. Come on.

1:11:31.754 --> 1:11:33.422
Baby, I'm sorry.

1:11:33.422 --> 1:11:34.723
We did what we had to do.

1:11:34.723 --> 1:11:36.659
I told you I got rid of the body.

1:11:36.659 --> 1:11:38.327
- Bobby, please can you just come with me?

1:11:38.327 --> 1:11:39.928
Please just come with me back to Milwaukee.

1:11:39.928 --> 1:11:41.930
I packed everything, let's just go.

1:11:41.930 --> 1:11:43.599
We can start over. We can do it.

1:11:43.599 --> 1:11:45.668
- I can't go nowhere unless I can pick the city up

1:11:45.668 --> 1:11:46.735
and take it with me.

1:11:46.735 --> 1:11:48.304
I ain't leaving.

1:11:48.304 --> 1:11:49.938
- Typical ass Bobby.

1:11:49.938 --> 1:11:51.507
You don't never know when to fucking fold.

1:11:51.507 --> 1:11:53.342
- Hold on, old on, hold on.

1:11:53.342 --> 1:11:54.610
Don't leave.

1:11:54.610 --> 1:11:56.845
- Bobby, if you stayed in Detroit,

1:11:56.845 --> 1:11:58.514
your ass gonna be in jail.

1:11:58.514 --> 1:12:00.182
They're gonna fucking kill you nigga.

1:12:00.182 --> 1:12:01.750
This place is not for music.

1:12:01.750 --> 1:12:04.086
It's for killers and drug dealers.

1:12:04.086 --> 1:12:05.621
And I'm leaving.

1:12:05.621 --> 1:12:07.656
- I fought too hard for this dream.

1:12:07.656 --> 1:12:09.158
- Stay in Detroit if you want to.

1:12:09.158 --> 1:12:11.660
Carry this city on your back, do whatever you want to do.

1:12:11.660 --> 1:12:13.629
Just don't get killed while doing it.

1:12:13.629 --> 1:12:14.496

1:26:52.607 --> 1:26:55.610
(tense organ music)

1:27:18.032 --> 1:27:21.169
- Funerals are not for the one who has passed on.

1:27:21.169 --> 1:27:24.172
Funerals are for those who are living

1:27:24.172 --> 1:27:26.841
after the one who has passed on.

1:27:30.411 --> 1:27:34.015
This funeral is not for our brother, Bobby.

1:27:35.483 --> 1:27:39.787
This funeral is for those of us who are still alive,

1:27:40.955 --> 1:27:44.392
that we may learn from our brother, Bobby.

1:27:44.392 --> 1:27:48.930
That we may learn from the life of our brother, Bobby.

1:27:48.930 --> 1:27:52.533
We gotta understand that we're still here,

1:27:52.533 --> 1:27:57.538
and the message he gave us, we must take into consideration.

1:27:59.507 --> 1:28:03.711
And we must live our life in accord to the message.

1:28:05.346 --> 1:28:08.416
The scripture says, "In the beginning was the word

1:28:08.416 --> 1:28:13.254
and the word was with God, and the word word was God.

1:28:13.254 --> 1:28:17.358
And the word became flesh and dwelled among men."

1:28:19.894 --> 1:28:22.030
Will you take the word into your heart?

1:28:22.030 --> 1:28:23.931
Will you take the word into your life?

1:28:23.931 --> 1:28:25.867
Will you live the word?

1:28:27.435 --> 1:28:31.406
We gotta understand that right now we're living in an hour

1:28:31.406 --> 1:28:34.742
where you gotta make your word your bond.

1:28:34.742 --> 1:28:37.612
Your word is your bond, and your bond is your life.

1:28:37.612 --> 1:28:40.081
And you should be willing like brother Bobby

1:28:40.081 --> 1:28:45.086
to give your word and give your life before your word fades.

1:28:46.754 --> 1:28:50.325
Our brother Bobby influenced not only the individuals

1:28:50.325 --> 1:28:54.195
in the city of Detroit, from the West Side, the East Side,

1:28:54.195 --> 1:28:56.030
Southwest, North side.

1:28:57.231 --> 1:28:59.000
Bobby affected not only Detroit,

1:28:59.000 --> 1:29:01.703
but he affected the entire world.

1:29:04.539 --> 1:29:09.344
We don't want you just to simply affect your block.

1:29:09.344 --> 1:29:13.848
We want you to affect 57 million, 255,000 square miles

1:29:15.116 --> 1:29:17.452
of land on the planet earth.

1:29:18.853 --> 1:29:23.358
You gotta understand that you're living on this planet,

1:29:23.358 --> 1:29:26.861
and what effect will you make on this planet?

1:29:26.861 --> 1:29:30.765
Will you take his message, and become a messenger

1:29:30.765 --> 1:29:32.033
of the message?

1:29:33.401 --> 1:29:36.738
Will you simply hold it in your chest, or will you take it

1:29:36.738 --> 1:29:39.941
and work it through your hands and your feet?

1:29:39.941 --> 1:29:42.410
We have to do this work.

1:29:42.410 --> 1:29:45.313
Not just simply to please ourselves,

1:29:45.313 --> 1:29:49.384
but we should do it in honor of our brother Bobby.

1:29:49.384 --> 1:29:53.020
We're out here in the world as an example

1:29:53.020 --> 1:29:55.857
of what our brother wanted us to be.

1:29:55.857 --> 1:29:59.627
And so if you are going to do this work,

1:29:59.627 --> 1:30:04.632
and you're gonna show him and have him smile down on you,

1:30:05.800 --> 1:30:08.503
then be courageous and bold in your stance.

1:30:08.503 --> 1:30:12.440
The scripture says, "Be fruitful and multiply."

1:30:15.109 --> 1:30:15.943
- How long we got? We ready?

1:30:15.943 --> 1:30:16.878
Oh, I'm sorry.

1:30:16.878 --> 1:30:18.012
Come on, everybody smile.

1:30:18.012 --> 1:30:20.615
(upbeat music)

1:30:34.862 --> 1:30:38.099
(bright ambient music)

1:30:40.501 --> 1:30:43.704
- I got more fan mail for you.

1:30:43.704 --> 1:30:45.740
It's piling up every day.

1:30:53.848 --> 1:30:56.484
- I really don't want this shit.

1:30:58.386 --> 1:31:00.988
Just don't feel the same.

1:31:00.988 --> 1:31:03.825
- That man made y'all nigga stars.

1:31:04.692 --> 1:31:07.628
Y'all put on for the city,

1:31:07.628 --> 1:31:11.265
and you should be proud of yourself.

1:31:11.265 --> 1:31:13.868
Take these two years and think.

1:31:15.603 --> 1:31:18.940
Get back out there and stake your claim.

1:31:20.374 --> 1:31:22.210
Bobby would want that.

1:31:24.212 --> 1:31:27.715

1:31:29.050 --> 1:31:32.286
(somber ambient music)

1:32:09.790 --> 1:32:13.628
- [Bobby] You know what I meant when I told you,

1:32:13.628 --> 1:32:16.130
"We is doing it for the city."

1:32:17.431 --> 1:32:21.035
I want you to continue doing that.
