<b>The Hunters have entered the palace in 
order to defeat the Chimera Ant King.</b>

00:22.870 --> 00:25.290
<b>My attacks don't work?</b>

00:25.890 --> 00:27.330
<b>What is this thing?</b>

00:30.610 --> 00:32.020
<b>Don't you run!</b>

00:32.020 --> 00:33.090
<b>Answer me!</b>

00:33.640 --> 00:35.200
<b>What is this thing?!</b>

00:39.860 --> 00:43.480
<b>I ain't gonna tell you, fool!</b>

00:44.170 --> 00:46.600
<b>If you wanna know, catch me first!</b>

00:49.440 --> 00:53.150
<b>To save the injured Shoot,</b>

00:53.150 --> 00:56.610
<b>Knuckle taunted Youpi to draw his attention.</b>

01:08.570 --> 01:11.910
<b><i>Knuckle's planning to fight Youpi alone...</i></b>

01:13.030 --> 01:18.640
<b><i>I can't weave through those 
blades of death to get to him!</i></b>

01:19.390 --> 01:20.360
<b><i>In that case...</i></b>

01:22.900 --> 01:27.140
<b><i>I must not lose consciousness...</i></b>

01:28.150 --> 01:30.000
<b><i>If I pass out,</i></b>

01:30.990 --> 01:35.760
<b><i>Hotel Rafflesia will stop...</i></b>

01:37.570 --> 01:45.090
<b><i>Every little bit of damage counts...</i></b>

01:50.690 --> 01:56.000
<b><i>I can still fight...</i></b>

01:57.070 --> 02:00.530
<b><i>I can still...</i></b>

02:05.270 --> 02:08.440
<b><i>Right now, my job...</i></b>

02:10.940 --> 02:13.400
<b><i>isn't to help Shoot!</i></b>

02:15.070 --> 02:18.010
<b><i>It's to use my power to help the others,</i></b>

02:18.010 --> 02:21.500
<b><i>so they can complete their 
missions as fast as possible!</i></b>

02:22.880 --> 02:26.690
<b>Though it broke his heart, 
Meleoron had to leave the two Hunters</b>

02:26.690 --> 02:30.500
<b>and follow Gon and Killua instead, 
in order to fulfill his mission.</b>

02:30.500 --> 02:35.620
<b>Meanwhile, Ikalgo proceeded further into 
the depths of the palace to rescue Palm.</b>

02:41.170 --> 02:42.830
<b><i>Satellite Dragonflies!</i></b>

02:51.570 --> 02:53.360
<b><i>I'm gonna rescue her.</i></b>

02:54.010 --> 02:55.860
<b><i>Palm is a friend of a friend.</i></b>

02:56.860 --> 02:58.240
<b><i>That makes her a friend...</i></b>

02:59.360 --> 03:00.810
<b><i>My friend!</i></b>

03:02.590 --> 03:06.290
<b>As Morel, the first Hunter 
to reach the throne room,</b>

03:06.290 --> 03:10.790
<b>waited to continue his battle with Pouf, 
who remained in his cocoon,</b>

03:10.790 --> 03:14.250
<b>Netero and the King were leaving the palace,</b>

03:14.250 --> 03:19.370
<b>and Gon and Killua had finally located Neferpitou,</b>

03:19.370 --> 03:22.020
<b>their target for avenging Kite.</b>

04:44.010 --> 04:49.010
<b>Revenge x And x Recovery</b>

05:54.040 --> 05:55.170
<b>Do you</b>

05:56.680 --> 05:58.280
<b>remember me?</b>

06:06.730 --> 06:08.770
<b>I'm Gon Freecss!</b>

06:09.650 --> 06:11.600
<b>I came here</b>

06:12.380 --> 06:14.350
<b>to get Kite back from you!</b>

06:19.500 --> 06:23.360
<b>Pitou didn't hear a single word Gon said.</b>

06:23.950 --> 06:27.120
<b>The only thing on Pitou's mind was 
surviving the current threat</b>

06:27.120 --> 06:29.760
<b>while carrying out the King's order.</b>

06:30.230 --> 06:34.180
<b>Every cell in Pitou's body was focused on that task.</b>

06:39.690 --> 06:41.630
<b><i>I must protect Komugi...</i></b>

06:42.530 --> 06:43.940
<b><i>At any cost!</i></b>

06:48.550 --> 06:49.630
<b><i>Something's not right.</i></b>

06:50.180 --> 06:53.890
<b>Watching from a short distance, Killua 
noticed that something was strange.</b>

06:55.200 --> 07:00.080
<b><i>Why isn't the enemy preparing for 
battle when we're right here?</i></b>

07:01.330 --> 07:03.650
<b><i>I can't sense any aura at all...</i></b>

07:04.540 --> 07:08.650
<b><i>Pitou might as well be completely 
naked... Utterly defenseless.</i></b>

07:09.720 --> 07:13.650
<b><i>Does Pitou think it can win without aura?</i></b>

07:14.380 --> 07:16.160
<b><i>No, that isn't possible.</i></b>

07:17.420 --> 07:20.760
<b><i>The aura coming from Gon now 
doesn't even compare to his usual.</i></b>

07:21.280 --> 07:25.400
<b><i>Even Pitou can't fight that without using</i> Nen.</b>

07:26.660 --> 07:28.270
<b><i>Is it because of where we are?</i></b>

07:29.340 --> 07:32.700
<b><i>Does Pitou believe that, at this distance,</i></b>

07:32.700 --> 07:36.480
<b><i>there'll be time to activate </i>Nen<i> if we do attack?</i></b>

07:37.280 --> 07:38.660
<b><i>That's possible.</i></b>

07:39.980 --> 07:42.480
<b><i>However, for some reason...</i></b>

07:42.940 --> 07:44.290
<b><i>That doesn't seem to be it.</i></b>

07:45.200 --> 07:46.510
<b><i>It almost looks like...</i></b>

07:47.010 --> 07:47.970
<b><i>That's it.</i></b>

07:49.630 --> 07:51.000
<b><i>It looks like...</i></b>

07:53.840 --> 07:55.300
<b><i>a mother</i></b>

07:56.100 --> 07:59.600
<b><i>using its own body to guard something weaker.</i></b>

08:01.160 --> 08:02.470
<b><i>That's ridiculous.</i></b>

08:02.890 --> 08:05.380
<b><i>Pitou isn't someone who's capable of that!</i></b>

08:06.120 --> 08:09.250
<b><i>But then, why did Grandpa...</i></b>

08:10.600 --> 08:14.080
<b><i>I'll let you draw your own conclusions 
about what's happening inside.</i></b>

08:17.890 --> 08:19.890
<b><i>...say something that cryptic?</i></b>

08:22.330 --> 08:27.000
<b>While Killua was fighting his natural instincts,</b>

08:27.000 --> 08:31.190
<b>the girl lying before them brought back</b>

08:31.190 --> 08:33.860
<b>images of a broken Kite to Gon's mind.</b>

08:48.340 --> 08:51.380
<b>Get away from her.</b>

08:58.530 --> 09:03.390
<b>I'm telling you to take that 
monster and get away from her.</b>

09:06.710 --> 09:09.270
<b>And then, fight me!</b>

09:10.010 --> 09:12.170
<b>Fight me, so I can get Kite back!</b>

09:29.140 --> 09:34.670
<b>The act of placing both palms face-up 
to display one's lack of malice</b>

09:35.470 --> 09:38.170
<b>was a gesture Killua recognized...</b>

10:06.250 --> 10:07.080
<b>Please</b>

10:08.450 --> 10:09.330
<b>wait.</b>

10:18.220 --> 10:19.910
<b>What the hell?!</b>

10:20.610 --> 10:22.860
<b>What am I supposed to wait for?</b>

10:27.120 --> 10:29.600
<b>Get up! We're going outside!</b>

10:31.250 --> 10:33.610
<b>Pitou's unexpected lack of resistance</b>

10:34.140 --> 10:37.910
<b>left Gon without a target for his rage.</b>

10:38.910 --> 10:43.110
<b>Meanwhile, Killua was close to fully 
understanding the current situation.</b>

10:43.110 --> 10:43.870
<b>It was...</b>

10:46.760 --> 10:49.660
<b><i>I know nothing beyond the mission I received.</i></b>

10:51.160 --> 10:55.200
<b><i>He was saying something 
unexpected happened!</i></b>

10:56.190 --> 10:59.260
<b><i>Grandpa knew nothing when 
he brought the dragon down.</i></b>

11:00.260 --> 11:03.100
<b><i>Grandpa's mission was probably</i></b>

11:03.100 --> 11:08.460
<b><i>to use Dragon Dive and Dragon Head to 
separate the King and Royal Guard.</i></b>

11:09.590 --> 11:12.290
<b><i>But he didn't know that she was here, too.</i></b>

11:14.080 --> 11:17.110
<b><i>Wait, this woman must be</i></b>

11:18.340 --> 11:22.320
<b><i>the third party that none of us knew about!</i></b>

11:26.220 --> 11:29.370
<b><i>And she's most likely</i></b>

11:29.370 --> 11:32.060
<b><i>the reason the King hurt himself.</i></b>

11:32.620 --> 11:35.320
<b><i>Why would the King do something 
so out of character?</i></b>

11:37.880 --> 11:42.580
<b><i>Because she is someone 
who's special to the King.</i></b>

11:43.490 --> 11:46.200
<b><i>Pitou isn't taking her apart.</i></b>

11:47.240 --> 11:49.750
<b><i>Pitou is healing her at the King's command!</i></b>

11:51.040 --> 11:54.730
<b><i>Pitou isn't only prevented from using
</i> En <i>when healing someone.</i></b>

11:55.290 --> 11:58.840
<b><i>All aura must be focused on 
healing ability when using it.</i></b>

12:01.070 --> 12:06.450
<b>However, Killua knew that this 
information would only have</b>

12:06.450 --> 12:08.500
<b>a negative effect on Gon.</b>

12:11.510 --> 12:13.040
<b><i>What do I do?</i></b>

12:13.700 --> 12:14.830
<b><i>What do I tell him?</i></b>

12:20.730 --> 12:21.260
<b>Go—</b>

12:21.260 --> 12:22.090
<b>I'll do anything!</b>

12:23.770 --> 12:26.190
<b>I'll do anything you say!</b>

12:27.360 --> 12:28.720
<b>So please wait.</b>

12:29.520 --> 12:30.100
<b>I...</b>

12:31.290 --> 12:34.320
<b>must save this person!</b>

12:45.350 --> 12:46.450
<b>Save...</b>

12:48.250 --> 12:50.860
<b>Save what?</b>

12:51.750 --> 12:52.850
<b>"Anything"?</b>

12:53.510 --> 12:55.110
<b>When you say "anything"...</b>

12:55.110 --> 12:55.870
<b>Killua...</b>

12:57.130 --> 12:58.880
<b>I'm asking the questions.</b>

13:04.800 --> 13:08.190
<b>What is it that you must save?</b>

13:20.460 --> 13:25.650
<b>Amidst the extreme tension, 
the answer Pitou chose to give was...</b>

13:27.270 --> 13:30.410
<b>This person is someone...</b>

13:31.380 --> 13:35.790
<b>Someone who's important 
to someone important to me.</b>

13:36.650 --> 13:38.810
<b>...the truth.</b>

13:40.640 --> 13:44.000
<b>She is the reason the King is who he is.</b>

13:45.350 --> 13:49.630
<b>If she dies, the King will cease to be who he is.</b>

13:50.270 --> 13:51.340
<b>She's that important.</b>

13:52.230 --> 13:53.180
<b>So...</b>

13:54.220 --> 13:57.820
<b>All I care about is saving her!</b>

13:58.960 --> 14:03.830
<b>Once she's healed, I'll do anything you want.</b>

14:04.690 --> 14:06.110
<b>So please wait!</b>

14:11.250 --> 14:13.990
<b>You want to save her?</b>

14:16.010 --> 14:17.970
<b>You must save her?</b>

14:19.440 --> 14:21.220
<b>Save her?</b>

14:41.370 --> 14:45.360
<b>How dare you say that...</b>

14:47.200 --> 14:48.740
<b>How dare you?!</b>

14:54.090 --> 14:55.380
<b>Damn it!</b>

14:56.430 --> 14:57.580
<b>The hell if...</b>

14:58.840 --> 15:03.740
<b>The hell if I'll listen to you!</b>

15:09.030 --> 15:10.630
<b>Gon, hold on!</b>

15:13.160 --> 15:17.140
<b>It's likely that we were 
the ones that injured her.</b>

15:18.250 --> 15:20.090
<b>It was probably Grandpa's Dragon Dive.</b>

15:21.210 --> 15:22.150
<b>And?</b>

15:22.580 --> 15:28.240
<b>Pitou is probably telling the 
truth about healing her.</b>

15:28.970 --> 15:29.900
<b>So?</b>

15:30.590 --> 15:33.260
<b>Let's wait until it's done.</b>

15:37.440 --> 15:38.490
<b>"Likely"?</b>

15:39.320 --> 15:40.160
<b>"Probably"?</b>

15:41.930 --> 15:44.510
<b>You want me to wait because 
of "likely" and "probably"?</b>

15:45.290 --> 15:49.920
<b>And after we wait, it's likely that this thing</b>

15:49.920 --> 15:51.880
<b>will do what I want?</b>

15:54.310 --> 15:56.740
<b>Likely? Probably?</b>

15:57.100 --> 15:57.930
<b>Seriously?!</b>

15:58.790 --> 15:59.930
<b>That's crap!</b>

16:00.590 --> 16:02.390
<b>That's just crap!</b>

16:04.010 --> 16:06.690
<b>Is something wrong with you?!</b>

16:07.030 --> 16:12.700
<b>You want... You want me to trust this thing?!</b>

16:12.700 --> 16:14.950
<b>I can't do that!</b>

16:29.060 --> 16:32.380
<b>If you want, you may also have my right arm...</b>

16:33.670 --> 16:35.720
<b>If that isn't enough,</b>

16:38.210 --> 16:40.220
<b>you can take both legs...</b>

16:48.300 --> 16:54.420
<b>If you're worried I'll change my mind 
after the healing finishes,</b>

16:55.060 --> 17:00.740
<b>you can break any part of my body 
that isn't required to heal her.</b>

17:01.610 --> 17:05.370
<b>Please let me save her!</b>

17:39.500 --> 17:40.770
<b>That isn't fair...</b>

17:41.500 --> 17:43.540
<b>That isn't fair, damn it!</b>

17:44.260 --> 17:46.540
<b>Why are you helping her,</b>

17:46.900 --> 17:51.300
<b>after everything you did to Kite?!</b>

17:51.300 --> 17:52.270
<b>Gon!</b>

17:52.270 --> 17:53.820
<b>Why?!</b>

17:56.040 --> 17:59.300
<b>Why?!</b>

18:35.840 --> 18:37.580
<b>To hell with that.</b>

18:45.430 --> 18:47.590
<b><i>First comes—</i></b>

18:47.590 --> 18:49.600
<b>Gon, if you kill Pitou,</b>

18:50.260 --> 18:52.110
<b>we'll never get Kite back.</b>

19:13.630 --> 19:15.430
<b>You have it easy, Killua.</b>

19:17.220 --> 19:19.120
<b>You're perfectly calm.</b>

19:21.890 --> 19:24.370
<b>Since it means nothing to you...</b>

19:38.370 --> 19:41.400
<b>I'm only saying this because 
you're out of control.</b>

19:42.670 --> 19:45.330
<b>Did you forget the first thing 
you said when we came here?</b>

19:46.790 --> 19:48.540
<b>We're here to get Kite back!</b>

19:49.110 --> 19:51.040
<b>Pull it together!</b>

20:03.770 --> 20:04.780
<b>Yeah.</b>

20:06.550 --> 20:08.130
<b>I'm okay now.</b>

20:27.130 --> 20:28.240
<b>How long?</b>

20:28.890 --> 20:30.330
<b>How long do I have to wait?</b>

20:33.010 --> 20:35.330
<b>To completely heal her</b>

20:35.880 --> 20:38.090
<b>will take three to four hours.</b>

20:38.570 --> 20:40.340
<b>No, I can't wait that long.</b>

20:45.840 --> 20:48.100
<b>If I have an hour,</b>

20:48.910 --> 20:52.050
<b>I can heal her most critical injuries.</b>

20:53.520 --> 20:56.200
<b>Please give me that.</b>

21:02.620 --> 21:08.370
<b>In one hour, you're coming with

21:09.320 --> 21:10.870
<b>Can you promise me that?</b>

21:12.290 --> 21:14.870
<b>I swear to keep that promise!</b>

21:24.160 --> 21:26.940
<b>I'll wait right here for one hour.</b>

23:24.630 --> 23:27.040
<b>Next time: Insult x And x Payback.</b>

23:27.040 --> 23:30.050
<b>I can't think of anything right now...</b>

23:30.050 --> 23:32.620
<b>Killua, insult me back!</b>

23:32.620 --> 23:34.460
<b>I... feel better now.</b>
