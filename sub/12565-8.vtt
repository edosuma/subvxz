breakfast therapy session.

00:05.700 --> 00:07.700

Oh, yeah.

01:25.800 --> 01:28.300
Well, because they are, but you can't
just take something from someone

01:29.800 --> 01:30.600
Yes, you can.

01:55.300 --> 01:57.100
Nothing. I'm standing here.

01:57.100 --> 01:58.200
That's loitering.

Alex, your popliteal artery is compromised.

04:04.900 --> 04:06.200
I need to reduce the dislocation,

04:06.200 --> 04:07.400
or you could lose your leg.

Yeah, okay. Whatever you got to do, doc.

God! Oh!

04:14.400 --> 04:15.400
Still hurts.

04:15.400 --> 04:17.500
His femoral condyles must have
gone through the quadricep.

04:17.600 --> 04:18.399
What does that mean?

04:18.500 --> 04:21.399
The top of his femur has pierced the
leg muscle and locked it in place.

04:21.399 --> 04:22.600
Unfortunately, to make it better,

04:22.600 --> 04:23.900
first I need to make it worse.

04:23.900 --> 04:25.200
Charlotte, hold his shoulders.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.300
The faster, the better.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.500
My parents had me on skis before I was five,

10:38.300 --> 10:40.100
before I lost my sight.

10:40.100 --> 10:42.800
Well, nothing slowed you down.

10:43.300 --> 10:45.000
It was a freak accident.

10:45.300 --> 10:47.200
I was playing with wet cement.

10:47.300 --> 10:49.000
And you damaged your corneas.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.600
I still have light sensitivity
in my right eye, though.

10:51.700 --> 10:54.700
Enough to tell that it is a perfect morning.

10:55.200 --> 10:57.100
The best I've ever had in Monaco.

10:57.200 --> 10:58.100
[Chuckles]

10:58.700 --> 11:01.000
You know, I rarely talk about my accident.

11:01.300 --> 11:03.100
I'm not sure why I brought it up.

11:03.600 --> 11:05.300
Maybe it's 'cause I'm a doctor.

11:05.600 --> 11:09.500
No, I think it's because you didn't ask.

11:20.400 --> 11:21.200
Hello.

11:21.200 --> 11:24.000
I'm calling for Viviana
Torres if she's working.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.200
I mean, if she's not busy.

11:25.200 --> 11:26.500
It's for you, Viviana.

11:28.300 --> 11:29.400
Viviana.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.700
Oh, hello, I hope I'm not disturbing you.

11:32.600 --> 11:35.200
It's Jeremiah Sacani. It's Dr. Sacani.

11:35.200 --> 11:37.200
- I was hoping you'd call.
- Oh, good.

11:37.200 --> 11:39.700
I mean, I was hoping you were hoping.

11:39.700 --> 11:41.900
I mean, do you like music?

11:41.900 --> 11:43.600
No, I hate music.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.100
Of course I love music.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.600
Well, there's a concert
tomorrow night at 8:00.

11:50.700 --> 11:52.800
I know that might be
pushing it with your work.

11:52.800 --> 11:53.800
Oh, sounds like fun.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.600
Text me the address,
and I'll meet you there.

11:56.100 --> 11:58.200
Oh, my boss is staring. Got to go.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.300
It's arranged then, 8:00... oh.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.200
New patient?

12:03.600 --> 12:06.000
Uh, she's not a patient.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.500
It's... never mind.

12:07.700 --> 12:09.400
You're being a little evasive.

12:09.700 --> 12:11.400
It's a private matter.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.400
So I texted Naomi.

12:15.400 --> 12:17.400
I just ran into my O.B. at the hospital,

12:17.400 --> 12:19.700
and I told her about Naomi's
infertility treatments,

12:19.800 --> 12:21.800
and she told me about a chat room to support

12:21.900 --> 12:24.100
and encourage women undergoing IVF.

12:24.100 --> 12:25.300
Oh, well, a chat room sounds like

12:25.400 --> 12:26.900
the proper forum for encouragement.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.200
[Laughs] Is there an improper forum?

12:30.500 --> 12:33.100
Well, I noticed you got a
little emotional with her.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Naomi's so keen to have a baby.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.400
Who wouldn't root for her?

12:37.900 --> 12:41.000
As long as rooting doesn't
cloud one's objectivity.

12:41.200 --> 12:43.700
There's nothing wrong with being positive.

12:44.500 --> 12:46.000
We all hope for the best.

12:52.700 --> 12:54.800
Okay, you can't... You
can't have a heated tryst

12:54.900 --> 12:57.700
with a hot spa owner in
Europe and not tell me, Henry.

12:57.700 --> 12:59.000
Look, we didn't part well.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
I thought we were just
ships passing in the night.

13:01.100 --> 13:04.000
Well, ship's in port now,
so tell me everything.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.200
- Okay.
- Okay.

13:05.300 --> 13:06.700
[Sighs]

13:07.400 --> 13:09.600
- Her name is Charlotte.
- Yeah.

13:10.500 --> 13:11.800
Yeah.

13:12.700 --> 13:14.900
That's not funny. It's
not fu... just tell me.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.600
Jeez, I didn't realize Hank's
hookups were such a big deal.

13:17.600 --> 13:19.900
Well, they are...
they're like freakin' bigfoot sightings.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.600
They're like sasquatch sightings.

13:21.700 --> 13:25.200
Oh, my God, Instagram rules. She is here.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.500
Emma who in the flesh drinking a...

13:27.500 --> 13:30.200
A caramel macchiato. Hi.

13:30.200 --> 13:33.100
I'm Parker, and caramel
macchiato is totally my drink.

13:33.100 --> 13:35.400
And I wanted to hate you just for
blowing up all over the Snark.

13:35.500 --> 13:37.300
I mean, Emma who, big mystery.

13:37.300 --> 13:39.700
She can't be that pretty, but look at you.

13:39.800 --> 13:42.000
I want your hair. Where do you get it done?

13:42.200 --> 13:43.600
In my bathroom.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.300
- Um, hi.
- Hi.

13:45.300 --> 13:47.000
Um, what's the Snark?

13:47.000 --> 13:48.400
Both: Snarkhampton.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.200
It's a gossip site.

13:50.200 --> 13:51.800
And her photo's all over it.

13:51.900 --> 13:53.600
Emma who? Where did she come from?

13:53.600 --> 13:55.000
She's this week's best of the best.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.800
Totally knocked Reed off her throne.

13:57.700 --> 13:59.000
Oh, my God, look at that.

14:00.200 --> 14:01.400
It's Emma.

14:01.700 --> 14:03.500
Yeah, there she is.

14:03.800 --> 14:05.100
And again.

14:05.100 --> 14:06.200
And again.

14:06.300 --> 14:08.600
We're all like, you must
be paying Oz a fortune.

14:08.600 --> 14:10.300
I don't even know who Oz is.

14:10.400 --> 14:11.500
- Oz?
- Yes.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.400
No one knows who he is,
but he picks who's hot

14:13.400 --> 14:15.300
but can also totally burn you.

14:16.800 --> 14:18.700
Snarkhampton's just a silly gossip site.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.400
I couldn't agree more.

14:20.800 --> 14:22.400
Sorry if my kid sister's bugging you.

14:22.400 --> 14:23.900
She gets a little starstruck.

14:24.400 --> 14:25.500
I'm no star.

14:25.500 --> 14:27.100
You're the mysterious Emma who.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.300
I'm the not-so-mysterious Cinco.

14:29.300 --> 14:30.600
Oh, hi. Hi.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.100
Nice to meet you. Hi, Cinco Phipps, hey.

14:33.100 --> 14:34.500
Hey, nice to meet you. I'm Hank.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.100
- Nice to meet you.
- Evan, nice to meet you.

14:36.100 --> 14:37.900
- Pleasure.
- He's really William the Fifth,

14:37.900 --> 14:39.300
but that sounds all velvet cape,

14:39.300 --> 14:40.500
so we call him Cinco.

14:40.500 --> 14:41.900
Are you coming to my party tomorrow?

14:41.900 --> 14:43.200
I wasn't invited.

14:43.600 --> 14:45.100
This is me inviting you.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.200
Right. Okay.

14:47.300 --> 14:48.800
Um, where do you live?

14:49.200 --> 14:51.300
My driver Garcia can pick you up.

14:52.300 --> 14:53.700
Oh, you have a driver.

14:53.700 --> 14:55.000
Garz used to be our manny,

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
but cinco's all "my driver"
now since he's turning 18.

14:58.700 --> 15:00.100
Let's give him your address.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.200
Okay.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.900
Your gay dads are cool.

15:04.200 --> 15:05.300
Ah.

15:06.900 --> 15:08.600
What's she getting herself into?

15:08.700 --> 15:11.300
A chauffeured Bentley
with a guy named Cinco.

15:11.500 --> 15:13.000
Who was very polite.

15:13.900 --> 15:15.400
Yeah, I don't like him either.

15:26.900 --> 15:28.100
- Oh!
- Whoa.

15:28.100 --> 15:29.900
So sorry.

15:30.100 --> 15:32.700
Too much multitasking, not
enough looking where I'm going.

15:32.800 --> 15:34.100
You are in a rush.

15:34.100 --> 15:37.600
A patient Jeremiah and I saw this
morning has developed hematemesis,

15:37.600 --> 15:39.000
but I have a minute.

15:39.000 --> 15:39.900
Do you need me?

15:39.900 --> 15:42.700
Oh, no, no, no, no, I
have someone coming over.

15:43.500 --> 15:44.600
Someone?

15:44.600 --> 15:46.500
Yeah, I'll tell you later.
It's a long story.

15:46.600 --> 15:48.500
Oh, my gosh, between you and Jeremiah,

15:48.500 --> 15:50.200
I don't know who's become more mysterious.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.100
- What's up with Jeremiah?
- I don't know.

15:52.200 --> 15:55.600
We've gotten to be such close
friends since I became pregnant.

15:55.700 --> 15:59.100
He's been an amazing source of support
and comfort for me this past year,

15:59.200 --> 16:01.000
and I've tried to be
there for him in return.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.800
But recently, he's gotten secretive.

16:03.800 --> 16:05.300
Huh. You're not worried, are you?

16:05.400 --> 16:08.300
I don't know enough to be
worried, which worries me.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.400
[Chuckles] Look, it is Jeremiah.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.100
Yeah, I know, but it seems sort of odd.

16:12.200 --> 16:14.500
Which is what I meant when
I said "it is Jeremiah."

16:14.600 --> 16:16.500
But if you're concerned, talk to him.

16:16.600 --> 16:19.200
I will. But you're probably right.

16:19.500 --> 16:20.700
It is Jeremiah.

16:20.700 --> 16:21.500
Yeah.

16:21.900 --> 16:23.900
Okay, so tell me what happens.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.000
Yeah.

16:26.800 --> 16:30.400
Only if you tell me your long story.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.400
Ah, I'd love to, but you have a patient,

16:32.400 --> 16:34.000
and I got things to do.

16:36.100 --> 16:36.900
[Chuckles]

16:40.000 --> 16:41.500
[Whistle blows] Come on.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.300
Make your points and keep up the pace.

16:43.400 --> 16:44.400
All right, all right.

16:44.600 --> 16:47.100
Look, I know what Russel did was bad,

16:47.200 --> 16:49.000
but people should get three strikes.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.100
People who play baseball,
not people who steal.

16:51.100 --> 16:51.700
All right.

16:51.800 --> 16:53.600
Stealing's a big part of
baseball, though, so...

16:53.700 --> 16:55.200
Okay, well, this isn't baseball,

16:55.200 --> 16:56.700
and Russel didn't steal home.

16:56.700 --> 16:57.900
He stole a rug from a home.

16:57.900 --> 16:59.000
Paige you're slowing down. Don't slow down.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
- Ah!
- I'm gonna slip!

17:00.100 --> 17:01.000
[Blows whistle]

17:02.500 --> 17:05.599
So what have we learned?

17:06.900 --> 17:08.599
That we suck at party games.

17:08.599 --> 17:12.099
That we can't move forward
if we don't move together.

17:12.400 --> 17:14.300
Excellent. Come here.

17:16.400 --> 17:18.900
Now we're getting somewhere.

17:19.300 --> 17:20.200
What?

17:20.900 --> 17:22.599
I feel like we're not getting anywhere.

17:22.900 --> 17:24.500
I mean, this is fun and everything,

17:24.500 --> 17:27.500
but what should she do about Russel?

17:27.500 --> 17:28.600
That's not for me to say.

17:28.700 --> 17:30.000
I've never even met the man.

17:31.700 --> 17:33.700
- Well, you could.
- Meet him.

17:35.400 --> 17:36.900
Both: Please.

17:38.100 --> 17:40.100
I love how you two challenge me.

17:40.300 --> 17:42.300
Let's pencil this in for tomorrow.

17:42.300 --> 17:43.800
And... [Blows whistle]

17:44.100 --> 17:45.400
- Okay.
- Here we go.

17:45.400 --> 17:47.600
Right together. One, two, three, four.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.100
Two, three, four.

17:51.700 --> 17:53.600
Okay, so you've been upstairs,

17:53.600 --> 17:55.100
downstairs, met Emma.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.200
I think that's everything.

17:56.300 --> 17:57.800
- Hello there.
- Except that.

17:58.800 --> 17:59.900
Hi.

17:59.900 --> 18:01.200
I'm Charlotte.

18:02.200 --> 18:03.900
[Whispers] You never said she was blind.

18:04.500 --> 18:05.700
You must be Evan.

18:05.700 --> 18:08.100
Yes, I am Evan. Hi, Charlotte.

18:08.100 --> 18:09.000
[Whispers] How did she do that?

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Well, I'm blind, not deaf.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.600
And I may have mentioned you.

18:12.700 --> 18:14.600
Sorry, I'm just... wow.

18:14.600 --> 18:16.200
It's so nice to finally meet you.

18:16.200 --> 18:17.500
You too.

18:18.800 --> 18:20.100
Evan what... what are
you... what are you doing?

18:20.200 --> 18:21.100
I'm showing her what I look like.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.000
Okay, stop that. Blind people
don't want to feel your face

18:23.100 --> 18:24.500
- any more than sighted people do.
- What?

18:24.600 --> 18:26.700
But it's a weirdly common misconception.

18:26.700 --> 18:28.700
Actually we prefer to
sniff your hindquarters.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.500
- That's a joke, right?
- Right.

18:31.600 --> 18:32.700
Okay.

18:32.800 --> 18:34.600
But you do have super smell
and super hearing, though.

18:34.600 --> 18:37.000
Another common misconception.
We don't have super anything.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.800
I just depend on my other senses more.

18:38.800 --> 18:39.700
[Doorbell rings]

18:39.800 --> 18:41.800
For instance, that was the doorbell.

18:41.900 --> 18:43.500
- That was another joke.
- [Chuckles]

18:43.500 --> 18:44.700
You're getting it.

18:44.900 --> 18:46.200
- Hi.
- Emma Miller?

18:46.300 --> 18:47.800
- Yes.
- Sign here, please.

18:49.300 --> 18:51.500
They're compliments of the
shop for your event tomorrow.

18:51.500 --> 18:52.900
Oh, my gosh, thank you.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.100
- What's up?
- They're from Berkeley's.

18:56.200 --> 18:58.400
They want me to wear one to Cinco's party.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.500
- Well, you are Emma who.
- [Chuckles]

19:01.900 --> 19:03.700
Oh, my gosh.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.000
There's so many.

19:08.200 --> 19:10.000
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

19:10.300 --> 19:12.000
They're gorgeous.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.400
Ooh, Charlotte, what do
you think of this one?

19:16.400 --> 19:17.800
[Whispers] Emma, she's blind.

19:17.800 --> 19:19.200
But again, not deaf.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.000
Oh, I love chiffon.

19:22.600 --> 19:23.800
Wait.

19:24.800 --> 19:26.300
Is it a little short?

19:26.300 --> 19:27.700
There's only one way to find out.

19:27.700 --> 19:28.900

30:20.100 --> 30:23.100
I put her on her back, and
she rolls over onto her tummy.

30:23.200 --> 30:24.600
It's incredible.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.100
Come on.

30:27.100 --> 30:29.800
Please do it again. Come on.

30:29.800 --> 30:31.300
Come on, Sash.

30:31.300 --> 30:32.500
I look forward to the video.

30:33.600 --> 30:35.100
Did you review Naomi's blood work?

30:35.500 --> 30:37.000
Yes, I've already called her.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.100
She's anemic, and her L.F.Ts are high.

30:39.100 --> 30:41.000
I scheduled a C.T. for the morning.

30:41.100 --> 30:43.500
I also remembered she mentioned acupuncture,

30:43.500 --> 30:45.000
so I asked about supplements.

30:45.200 --> 30:46.900
She's been drinking special teas.

30:46.900 --> 30:48.200
I told her to stop.

30:48.200 --> 30:49.400
What about IVF?

30:49.400 --> 30:50.700
Have you told her she may have to drop out?

30:50.800 --> 30:51.600
She might not have to

30:51.600 --> 30:53.500
if we can figure out what's
wrong with her liver.

30:54.600 --> 30:57.400
Look, I know that I've
let this get personal,

30:57.500 --> 30:59.800
but Naomi's worked so hard to be a mother.

30:59.800 --> 31:01.300
- I want that for her.
- [Cell phone chimes]

31:02.700 --> 31:03.900
Oh, no.

31:04.100 --> 31:05.200
What, is it Naomi?

31:05.200 --> 31:07.600
No, it's Evan. He needs me on call tonight.

31:08.900 --> 31:10.800
Tonight's your private matter.

31:10.800 --> 31:12.700
- Yes.
- I'll cover for you.

31:12.900 --> 31:16.000
My nanny's free tonight, and you've
covered for me so much lately.

31:16.500 --> 31:18.100
Thank you. Are you sure?

31:18.100 --> 31:19.300
Of course.

31:19.400 --> 31:22.100
I would hate for you to
miss your private matter.

31:23.600 --> 31:25.500
Oh. When did that happen?

31:26.700 --> 31:29.200
She did it again, and I missed it again.

31:29.500 --> 31:31.200
Come on. Come on.

31:32.800 --> 31:34.200
[Cries]

31:35.500 --> 31:36.500
[Sighs]

31:36.600 --> 31:37.800
Come on, honey.

31:38.200 --> 31:39.400
I'm cool now.

31:39.500 --> 31:40.700
Call off Medevac.

31:40.700 --> 31:42.600
You should still let Hank check you out.

31:42.800 --> 31:47.200
Guys, I may have slipped Cinco
a few too many magic beans.

31:47.200 --> 31:49.000
Avast, ye scurvy dogs!

31:49.100 --> 31:51.800
Raise the mainsail!

31:51.800 --> 31:54.100
All hands. We're casting off.

31:54.100 --> 31:56.800
- Dude, chill.
- Out to sea.

31:56.900 --> 31:58.200
[Laughs]

31:58.300 --> 32:00.300
Cinco, stop! You'll ruin the boat.

32:00.300 --> 32:02.200
Go to the helm. We're heading for a... hey!

32:02.200 --> 32:03.300
Easy, man.

32:03.800 --> 32:06.000
I'm the captain now!

32:06.000 --> 32:08.500
Walk the plank. Deep six.

32:08.500 --> 32:10.800
Cinco, come on. You are out of control.

32:10.800 --> 32:12.200
[Screams]

32:12.200 --> 32:13.200
No!

32:14.400 --> 32:16.200
[Laughing]

32:17.900 --> 32:22.000
What the... who are you?

32:22.500 --> 32:23.800
Easy, easy.

32:25.500 --> 32:27.600
[Grunting]

32:28.300 --> 32:29.100
What's he on?

32:29.200 --> 32:30.300
Bath salts.

32:33.800 --> 32:34.600
Okay.

32:36.700 --> 32:38.000
[Screams]

32:38.000 --> 32:39.600
Oh, my God, what did you do to him?

32:39.600 --> 32:42.700
Sedated him until the cathinone
in his system can be metabolized.

32:42.800 --> 32:44.700
- He may need another shot or two.
- Ahh!

32:44.700 --> 32:45.700
Whoa.

32:51.100 --> 32:53.300
That should do it for now.

32:58.100 --> 33:00.500
I don't need a therapist.
I have a therapist.

33:00.500 --> 33:03.400
We have come to your house, your haven,

33:03.400 --> 33:05.000
your sanctum sanctorum.

33:05.100 --> 33:06.900
- You're feeling ambushed.
- Because you ambushed me.

33:06.900 --> 33:08.000
Because you ambushed the rug.

33:08.000 --> 33:12.500
To preserve its dignity,
its heritage, and its beauty.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.700
- It does look really good.
- Evan.

33:14.800 --> 33:15.900
But I'm here for Paige.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.600
It looks good because I had it repaired.

33:18.700 --> 33:21.000
Yes, but what have you
damaged in the process?

33:21.000 --> 33:22.200
This is getting deep.

33:22.300 --> 33:23.600
Let's try something.

33:23.700 --> 33:25.300
Everyone lie down.

33:25.900 --> 33:28.100
- Really?
- Please.

33:31.800 --> 33:33.300
Relax.

33:34.200 --> 33:35.500
Feel the rug.

33:36.600 --> 33:38.900
Hear the rug.

33:39.700 --> 33:42.100
Understand the rug.

33:42.800 --> 33:46.400
What would it have you
do? Would it understand?

33:46.400 --> 33:48.100
It's Paige or the rug, Russel.
What's it gonna be?

33:49.100 --> 33:53.100
Good clarity, Evan, but
let's give Russel a moment.

33:59.600 --> 34:02.100
When you said concert, for some reason,

34:02.100 --> 34:03.800
I assumed you meant rock concert.

34:04.400 --> 34:06.300
- You hate classical music.
- No, I like it.

34:06.400 --> 34:08.000
I'm just not dressed for it.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.100
No, you look beautiful.

34:09.800 --> 34:11.100
Please stay.

34:11.600 --> 34:13.100
I wasn't gonna leave.

34:13.500 --> 34:15.600
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

34:16.900 --> 34:18.199
[Clears throat] Two please.

34:18.800 --> 34:21.199
I'm sorry, it's cash only.

34:21.199 --> 34:22.300
Cash only?

34:23.100 --> 34:25.400
Uh, why have such a policy?

34:25.400 --> 34:26.800
I'm just a volunteer.

34:26.800 --> 34:28.000
I have cash.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.100
It's just that I find paper
currency cumbersome,

34:32.100 --> 34:33.900
and of course, there are
the known sanitary issues,

34:33.900 --> 34:35.300
but still, I feel embarrassed.

34:35.300 --> 34:36.699
Please. My treat.

34:36.800 --> 34:38.699
Thank you, but I will repay you.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.900
Only if you get it in pesos.

34:41.800 --> 34:43.100
What happened?

34:43.199 --> 34:45.699
I got a date for my deportation hearing.

34:47.100 --> 34:48.400
How was your day?

34:48.800 --> 34:50.100
We better go in.

34:54.199 --> 34:55.400
Thanks for coming.

34:55.400 --> 34:56.600
Thanks for calling.

34:56.600 --> 34:59.100
That was some pretty weak sarcasm.

34:59.100 --> 35:01.100
Could be because I meant it.

35:01.800 --> 35:04.200
I'm glad you feel okay calling
me in a situation like that,

35:04.200 --> 35:06.600
not that I want it to
become a regular thing.

35:06.600 --> 35:07.700
It was crazy.

35:07.700 --> 35:09.600
I mean, I've been to parties
where people are out of control,

35:09.600 --> 35:15.000
but usually there aren't yachts
and chauffeurs and Prada gift bags.

35:15.400 --> 35:17.300
Yeah, well, money doesn't change people,

35:17.500 --> 35:19.800
but it sometimes shows
you who they really are.

35:20.400 --> 35:21.700
Unfortunately.

35:22.500 --> 35:25.400
Wait. Where's Charlotte?

35:25.700 --> 35:27.200
Did I make you miss your date?

35:27.300 --> 35:28.500
Ah, it's okay.

35:28.500 --> 35:30.600
Given the circumstances,
she'll understand if I...

35:30.700 --> 35:32.500
What? It's over, and you said I did good,

35:32.600 --> 35:34.500
so go change your shirt and get out of here.

35:34.600 --> 35:35.700
Okay. Okay.

35:35.800 --> 35:37.100
We can talk more about this later.

35:37.100 --> 35:38.500
Oh, yeah, I can't wait.

35:38.600 --> 35:40.100
Now that's some sarcasm.

35:40.200 --> 35:41.600
[Laughs] [Cell phone chimes]

35:45.800 --> 35:48.500
__

36:02.000 --> 36:03.700
[Doorbell rings] Oh, I'll get it.

36:07.800 --> 36:08.800
Hi.

36:08.800 --> 36:11.900
Cinco would like you to know that
he sincerely regrets today's events

36:11.900 --> 36:13.900
and hopes that you will accept this gift

36:13.900 --> 36:15.800
until he can apologize himself.

36:15.800 --> 36:16.900
Thank you.

36:18.400 --> 36:20.200
He really is a good kid.

36:44.400 --> 36:47.100

36:52.000 --> 36:54.300
Berkeley's dropped off the
shoes a little late, huh?

36:54.300 --> 36:55.600
Yeah.

36:55.900 --> 36:57.100
See you later.

36:57.100 --> 36:58.100
Later.

37:05.800 --> 37:07.200
Naomi!

37:08.500 --> 37:09.700
Hi.

37:10.900 --> 37:12.100
Are you okay?

37:12.200 --> 37:14.300
You didn't answer your phone
earlier or the door just now.

37:14.400 --> 37:15.600
I was worried.

37:15.700 --> 37:17.500
Everything is perfect.

37:19.300 --> 37:20.800
I'm pregnant.

37:23.400 --> 37:25.300
No, you're swollen...

37:26.900 --> 37:31.100
and jaundiced and confused.

37:31.500 --> 37:33.600
I think your liver function has...

37:33.800 --> 37:35.700
[Teakettle whistles]

37:35.700 --> 37:39.100
Naomi, I'll take care of it.

37:39.600 --> 37:41.700
Naomi, stop.

37:42.300 --> 37:43.400
I got it.

37:44.400 --> 37:45.800
[Whistling stops]

37:56.700 --> 38:00.000
Naomi, all these pots and pans,

38:00.000 --> 38:01.600
do you cook with them?

38:01.600 --> 38:02.900
Every day.

38:02.900 --> 38:04.400
They're the ones my mother used.

38:04.900 --> 38:06.000
Why?

38:07.200 --> 38:09.500
The swelling in your belly is probably

38:09.500 --> 38:12.500
fluid accumulating in
your peritoneal cavity.

38:12.600 --> 38:15.500
It's called ascites, and
along with the confusion,

38:15.500 --> 38:17.500
it's a byproduct of liver damage.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
So I'm not pregnant?

38:20.000 --> 38:24.500
I'm afraid not, but I think I know
the cause of your liver problems

38:24.600 --> 38:27.100
along with all the symptoms
you've been experiencing.

38:27.500 --> 38:29.600
You have too much copper in your blood.

38:29.900 --> 38:31.500
I'm taking you to the hospital.

38:37.100 --> 38:39.600
The penicillamine acts as a chelating agent

38:39.700 --> 38:41.700
to remove the excess
copper from your system.

38:41.700 --> 38:43.600
So each time I used mama's old pots,

38:43.600 --> 38:45.300
I was poisoning my liver?

38:45.300 --> 38:46.200
Mm-hmm.

38:46.700 --> 38:48.700
Thank God Greg doesn't drink tea.

38:48.700 --> 38:51.100
Yes, he wasn't exposed
to as much copper as you.

38:51.200 --> 38:54.000
Too much copper can also replace zinc

38:54.000 --> 38:56.400
and block estrogen receptors.

38:56.400 --> 38:58.800
Which would prevent me
from getting pregnant.

38:58.900 --> 39:00.600
Yes. Once you remove it,

39:00.600 --> 39:02.200
you will vastly improve your odds.

39:02.900 --> 39:04.900
I'm so lucky you came over.

39:05.900 --> 39:07.100
Why did you?

39:07.100 --> 39:08.500
[Sighs] I don't know.

39:08.800 --> 39:10.800
Maybe maternal instinct.

39:10.800 --> 39:15.000
Ever since I had sashi, I have been
a mess of emotions and hormones,

39:15.700 --> 39:17.800
but in your case, I think it helped.

39:17.800 --> 39:20.900
Well, from one mess of hormones to another,

39:21.800 --> 39:25.600
thanks for everything.

39:28.400 --> 39:30.400
- The <i> Canon in D</i> was lovely.
- Mm.

39:30.900 --> 39:32.700
I prefer the Shostakovich,

39:32.700 --> 39:35.800
but maybe I've catered too many
weddings to enjoy Pachelbel.

39:36.700 --> 39:39.500
Should we try a rock concert next time?

39:39.600 --> 39:41.300
Only if you're wearing that.

39:41.900 --> 39:43.300
[Laughs]

39:44.400 --> 39:46.800
I've been thinking about
your immigration hearing.

39:48.200 --> 39:49.100
It doesn't seem right.

39:49.100 --> 39:51.000
You've lived here since you were a child.

39:51.800 --> 39:54.200
Some of my patients are very good lawyers.

39:54.500 --> 39:55.900
You're kind.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.700
I want to help any way I can.

39:57.900 --> 40:00.200
You can start by paying me back.

40:00.800 --> 40:01.700
Oh.

40:09.600 --> 40:15.800
[Indistinct chatter]

40:23.800 --> 40:25.700
I know it was hard to send the rug back.

40:25.800 --> 40:27.000
Are you gonna be okay?

40:27.000 --> 40:29.600
Mm, better than okay.

40:30.300 --> 40:33.100
Bob was right. It was weighing on me.

40:33.600 --> 40:35.600
Well, I'm proud you could let go

40:35.700 --> 40:37.600
and that we can start fresh.

40:37.600 --> 40:40.600
Well, not quite.

40:41.500 --> 40:42.700
What do you mean?

40:44.100 --> 40:49.200
The porcelain foo dogs were
completely neglected by the Zhangs.

40:50.100 --> 40:54.500
The Wentworths used the
Navajo serape as a cat bed.

40:54.500 --> 40:57.900
The P.S. Heggen mid-century wastebasket?

40:58.000 --> 41:01.100
The Usamovs were putting
actual trash into it.

41:01.200 --> 41:04.900
The late 19th-century impressionist seascape

41:04.900 --> 41:07.100
was left hanging directly in the sun.

41:07.200 --> 41:11.900
The revival chandelier
was stored in a basement.

41:18.300 --> 41:20.800
How's your entree? Not too rare, I hope.

41:20.900 --> 41:23.900
Mm-mm. Chef fired it just perfectly.

41:24.600 --> 41:26.500
Want a bite? Yeah, I do.

41:30.200 --> 41:32.800
Mmm. Yeah, yeah.

41:32.800 --> 41:35.400
It's a little gamey, but it's pretty solid.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.100
Here, want a bite?

41:39.300 --> 41:40.600
Mmm.

41:40.800 --> 41:43.500
So listen, I know you
have a flight tomorrow,

41:43.500 --> 41:46.000
but I am not letting you get
away without a plan, okay?

41:46.000 --> 41:47.900
I want us to spend more time together.

41:48.700 --> 41:51.900
Well, that's good, because it
turns out I'm sticking around.

41:51.900 --> 41:53.000
What?

41:53.100 --> 41:54.700
I called the surgeon back.

41:55.200 --> 41:56.800
I want to get the transplant.

41:57.400 --> 41:58.600
Wow.

41:59.300 --> 42:01.400
I mean, I know... I know
you love a hairpin turn,

42:01.400 --> 42:03.500
but what changed your mind?

42:03.900 --> 42:05.200
You did.

42:05.200 --> 42:06.900
You reminded me what a risk taker I am,

42:06.900 --> 42:08.100
but you didn't push.

42:08.800 --> 42:11.500
Well, I-I try to learn from my mistakes.

42:12.800 --> 42:15.000
Thank you for giving me the space

42:15.000 --> 42:16.500
to come to this on my own.

42:18.600 --> 42:20.900
Thank you for giving me a second chance.
