00:06.000 --> 00:08.400
NARRATOR: On this Episode of
Life Below Zero...

00:08.433 --> 00:10.233
The end of the Thaw
is fast approaching.

00:10.267 --> 00:11.800
GLENN: Winter's coming.
I don't have a lot of time.

00:11.833 --> 00:15.100
NARRATOR:
Glenn abandons his camp
for a taste of civilisation.

00:15.133 --> 00:17.900
GLENN: I live about a 60-mile
walk from the nearest road.

00:17.933 --> 00:19.000
Long ways to go.

00:19.033 --> 00:20.800
NARRATOR:
The Hailstones set their nets

00:20.833 --> 00:22.300
for their last summer catch.

00:22.333 --> 00:25.667
We got the equipment...
Set the net and
see what we get.

00:25.700 --> 00:28.533
NARRATOR:
A brewing storm threatens
Sue's livelihood in Kavik.

00:28.567 --> 00:32.000
I've been out of aviation gas
for about a week now.

00:32.033 --> 00:34.100
I don't have the room to fail.

00:34.133 --> 00:37.133
And Andy and Kate struggle
to make their dream a reality.

00:37.167 --> 00:38.800
ANDY: Are they coming
off the ground?

00:39.600 --> 00:40.800
Andy!

00:50.967 --> 00:52.100
GLENN: In the summertime

00:52.133 --> 00:55.233
the life is just spread
so thin over the land up here.

00:59.367 --> 01:01.000
I'm running low on food.

01:02.233 --> 01:06.233
The only meat I have
is dried caribou meat.

01:06.267 --> 01:08.467
There's no trapping.
There's no big game hunting.

01:08.500 --> 01:10.500
I can't hunt moose
at this time of year.

01:10.533 --> 01:12.267
I can't really live off
the country

01:12.300 --> 01:14.067
as easily as you can
the rest of the year.

01:14.100 --> 01:15.567
So I'm getting ready to leave,

01:15.600 --> 01:17.700
and I'm gonna head out of here
towards the road.

01:17.733 --> 01:19.933
I'll probably be back
in the fall.

01:19.967 --> 01:21.400
NARRATOR:
Since fresh meat is scarce

01:21.433 --> 01:23.467
and difficult to preserve
in summer,

01:23.500 --> 01:25.633
Glenn could face
many lean days ahead

01:25.667 --> 01:27.033
if he stays at camp.

01:27.067 --> 01:28.867
His goal is to reach
the nearest road

01:28.900 --> 01:30.533
without running out of food.

01:30.567 --> 01:32.767
And then make his way
to Fairbanks.

01:32.800 --> 01:34.867
GLENN: I travel really light.

01:34.900 --> 01:37.400
It's important to stay light
so I can make it to the road

01:37.433 --> 01:39.667
without taking forever
to get there.

01:39.700 --> 01:44.767
Sleeping bag, tent, rifle,
knife, backpack.

01:44.800 --> 01:47.067
NARRATOR: He'll take
just enough to eat
for an emergency.

01:47.100 --> 01:49.533
But all his other meals
on the 60-mile journey

01:49.567 --> 01:51.167
will have to come
from the land.

01:51.200 --> 01:53.733
Okay, so the pack's
almost full and
I don't have much food.

01:53.767 --> 01:55.333
That's why I'm bringing
a fishing pole,

01:55.367 --> 01:58.000
in case I can get food
along the way.

01:58.033 --> 01:59.833
I'm not taking anything
I don't really need.

01:59.867 --> 02:01.133
I'm gonna miss the place.

02:01.167 --> 02:03.500
But food shortage,
that's my main concern.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.600
Long ways to go.

02:11.800 --> 02:14.567
I know how to get
generally to the road.

02:14.600 --> 02:15.967
I started coming out here

02:16.000 --> 02:18.400
before they had
satellite phones.

02:18.433 --> 02:20.367
I don't carry any kind of
navigation equipment.

02:20.400 --> 02:21.733
I don't carry a compass.

02:21.767 --> 02:23.567
But I don't carry a map
with me out here.

02:24.633 --> 02:25.967
You can stare
at a map for hours,

02:26.000 --> 02:27.400
but you don't know
anything about the land

02:27.433 --> 02:29.033
until you get out there
and walk on it.

02:29.067 --> 02:31.233
So I just navigate
by my memory

02:31.267 --> 02:32.700
and looking at the land.

02:41.833 --> 02:43.000
Look, there's a moose.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.200
In the fall,
I get more meat
from moose

02:48.233 --> 02:49.800
than any other animal.

02:49.833 --> 02:51.667
But this time of year,
I couldn't use a moose

02:51.700 --> 02:53.467
'cause I'm walking out.
I can't carry it.

02:53.500 --> 02:55.000
But he's right on the route
I gotta walk,

02:55.033 --> 02:57.233
so I'm gonna keep going,
work my way around him.

03:02.800 --> 03:04.300
Now, he hears me.

03:04.333 --> 03:05.400
There he goes.

03:05.433 --> 03:07.267
Maybe I'll meet up
with him next fall.

03:13.767 --> 03:15.633
This is what that moose
was eating.

03:17.367 --> 03:19.000
They're super tough
and bitter.

03:22.033 --> 03:23.167
These willow leaves...

03:23.200 --> 03:24.767
They're really
not very palatable.

03:27.067 --> 03:28.600
I found a little patch
of sour dock.

03:28.633 --> 03:30.600
This is a leaf that's good
at this time of year.

03:30.633 --> 03:31.867
It's even better cooked.

03:31.900 --> 03:34.533
But I don't have time
to cook it.

03:36.133 --> 03:37.700
Leaves don't give you
a whole lot of energy.

03:37.733 --> 03:39.533
But better than nothing.

03:42.167 --> 03:45.767
NARRATOR: There are several
species of poisonous plants
found in Alaska.

03:45.800 --> 03:49.333
If Glenn consumes
the wrong one,
it could be deadly.

03:49.367 --> 03:51.233
This is a flower that I eat.

03:51.267 --> 03:53.133
I think people call it
dwarf fireweed.

03:54.700 --> 03:57.600
I don't know.
I just call it food.

03:57.633 --> 03:59.733
There are two basic
categories of plant...

03:59.767 --> 04:01.767
Good to eat. Not good to eat.

04:02.767 --> 04:04.600
This one's good to eat.

04:08.433 --> 04:11.567
CHIP: No,
I'm not living a dream.
I'm just living this way.

04:11.600 --> 04:13.867
I didn't dream of this.
I didn't, uh...

04:13.900 --> 04:15.633
I didn't have a plan.

04:15.667 --> 04:17.533
I wouldn't know
what that dream is.

04:28.367 --> 04:30.400
Carol, you had
a green hat, right?

04:31.200 --> 04:32.467
Okay, here.

04:32.500 --> 04:33.500
Green hat.

04:34.733 --> 04:36.800
It's 2:00 in the morning,
sweetie pies.

04:36.833 --> 04:38.067
Is everybody ready
for the boat?

04:38.900 --> 04:40.267
Is everybody awake?

04:43.700 --> 04:46.000
Good morning.

04:46.033 --> 04:48.900
Even with your evil eyes,
it's still a good morning.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.433
NARRATOR: For the Hailstones,

05:12.467 --> 05:14.800
the long summer days
are a crucial opportunity

05:14.833 --> 05:17.233
to assure resources
that will help them survive

05:17.267 --> 05:19.067
through the long winter ahead.

05:21.267 --> 05:24.733
Today, they embark on
one of their most
important yearly hunts.

05:24.767 --> 05:26.300
The summer salmon run.

05:36.667 --> 05:38.567
Well, first time
I've come up this way

05:38.600 --> 05:40.100
so it's time to go get salmon

05:40.133 --> 05:41.867
while they're fat and
fresh out of the ocean.

05:42.467 --> 05:43.900
Throw all the kids in.

05:43.933 --> 05:46.333
Head down to one of our
favourite fishing camps,

05:46.367 --> 05:47.800
and stay there for a while.

05:50.133 --> 05:53.200
Everybody's good?
Where's my life jacket?

05:53.233 --> 05:54.800
AGNES: (CHUCKLES)
You don't get one.

05:54.833 --> 05:56.600
CHIP: Oh, I don't get one?
All right.

05:56.633 --> 05:58.767
(MOTOR REVVING)

05:58.800 --> 06:00.800
NARRATOR: Every summer,
thousands of salmon

06:00.833 --> 06:04.300
make their way from the ocean
to the rivers to spawn.

06:04.333 --> 06:05.533
To catch them,

06:05.567 --> 06:08.267
the Hailstone family
will travel 26 miles west

06:08.300 --> 06:11.433
where Agnes and her family
have fished for generations.

06:15.967 --> 06:18.167
CHIP: Oh, salmon!

06:18.200 --> 06:19.667
SUE: I have to wake up
every morning

06:19.700 --> 06:21.900
and look at my own mug
in the mirror,

06:21.933 --> 06:24.367
and if it's not
somebody I respect,

06:24.400 --> 06:26.400
it's going to make
the rest of my life suck.

06:39.300 --> 06:41.767
After winter,
I get a beating
with the storms.

06:41.800 --> 06:44.700
Any little thing,
even an ice chunk

06:44.733 --> 06:46.567
can tear holes
in the top of my tent.

06:46.600 --> 06:47.967
RICK: Careful.

06:51.367 --> 06:53.133
SUE: One of my things
I need to do

06:53.167 --> 06:55.033
every single summer

06:55.067 --> 06:58.800
is crawl up on my
roofline of the tent

06:58.833 --> 07:00.833
and fix any little
holes that I find.

07:00.867 --> 07:04.567
If I don't repair those
this winter,

07:04.600 --> 07:05.900
this shape of the building...

07:05.933 --> 07:09.333
The wind comes across and it
holds it down to the ground.

07:09.367 --> 07:12.100
You get... You compromise
the integrity of your shell,

07:12.133 --> 07:15.800
it's gonna become
an air foil that
wants to take off.

07:15.833 --> 07:19.133
Something came and macked
the top of the building

07:19.167 --> 07:21.500
and tore a longish groove.

07:22.467 --> 07:24.267
Patches are good.
Patches work.

07:24.300 --> 07:26.500
Patches aren't forever.

07:26.533 --> 07:28.333
Every time you patch it,

07:28.367 --> 07:31.767
you're weakening
the structural integrity.

07:31.800 --> 07:34.800
But I figure we're
supposed to get
a hell of storm comin' in.

07:37.367 --> 07:38.967
So, better get this done.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.633
Huge changes this year.

07:40.667 --> 07:42.967
You know, I went from being
somebody's employee

07:43.000 --> 07:45.767
to owning my own business.

07:45.800 --> 07:49.333
It is good to finally
be able to say,

07:49.367 --> 07:52.800
instead of just feel,
that Kavik is mine.

07:52.833 --> 07:55.467
Um, it comes with
a tremendous amount
of pressures.

07:55.500 --> 07:59.567
I knew full well that there'd
be a lot of money going out
just in improvements.

07:59.600 --> 08:02.867
There's nothing inexpensive
about being here.

08:03.933 --> 08:05.700
Well, I don't want to fall,
that's for sure.

08:08.567 --> 08:10.367
Suzy is a little chunky.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.133
I don't want to hurt
my building either.

08:13.200 --> 08:15.567
One wrong move and
I'll fall through it.

08:16.667 --> 08:17.767
Hey, Rick.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.867
I might need you to show me
where the holes are

08:19.900 --> 08:21.700
'cause I'm not seeing them.

08:21.733 --> 08:22.933
Right.

08:27.467 --> 08:29.567
-There's one here?
-Yeah.

08:29.600 --> 08:33.267
It's nice for me
to rely on myself.

08:33.300 --> 08:36.700
This year, Rick has been
here helping me out.

08:36.733 --> 08:39.967
It's a good thing that he's
been willing to be so helpful.

08:41.233 --> 08:43.200
Plus it gives me
somebody to push around.

08:44.600 --> 08:47.000
Can't be the king
if you don't have
any subjects.

08:52.333 --> 08:54.633
It's not comfortable
being 24 foot up in the air

08:54.667 --> 08:58.567
hanging off of a building
with no safety net.

08:58.600 --> 09:00.633
The saying is
if you don't like
the weather

09:00.667 --> 09:03.867
wait for 5 minutes
or fly 5 miles,
it will change.

09:03.900 --> 09:06.533
Weather comes in really,
really quickly.

09:06.567 --> 09:09.833
The fog will move at
20-30 miles an hour
sometimes.

09:09.867 --> 09:11.700
It's pretty amazing.

09:11.733 --> 09:15.400
You know, earlier today,
was a not-windy day.

09:15.433 --> 09:18.633
But as the system gets
closer and closer

09:18.667 --> 09:20.167
the wind is picking up.

09:20.200 --> 09:22.100
You're always, always, always

09:22.133 --> 09:25.300
trying to prepare
for what's next.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.400
ANDY: When I first
came out here,

09:29.433 --> 09:32.733
I didn't know much
about livin' out
in the bush at all.

09:32.767 --> 09:35.467
Just putting a little canoe
in the big Yukon River

09:35.500 --> 09:38.900
seemed like a pretty huge
adventure to me back then.

09:50.033 --> 09:51.867
People who live out
in the bush...

09:51.900 --> 09:54.967
The way we end up living
depends on what our skills are

09:55.000 --> 09:58.567
and what resources we have
available to us to work with.

10:00.033 --> 10:01.900
I have a lot of equipment
to work with,

10:01.933 --> 10:03.800
which makes it
a lot easier for me,

10:03.833 --> 10:06.733
so I can do things
maybe a little bit
different

10:06.767 --> 10:09.933
than a lot people living out
in the bush would do.

10:09.967 --> 10:12.500
I like building what I call
"rustic elegance."

10:12.533 --> 10:16.067
I like things to be fairly
well built, rustic looking,

10:16.100 --> 10:19.233
but also elegant in design.

10:19.267 --> 10:22.500
The cabin we live in now
was never meant to be
our permanent home.

10:22.533 --> 10:24.367
It was meant to be
a cabin to live in

10:24.400 --> 10:26.067
while we get our act together

10:26.100 --> 10:28.033
and build a really
efficient home.

10:28.067 --> 10:30.667
NARRATOR:
To make the foundation
for a new cabin,

10:30.700 --> 10:33.467
Andy must transport
10,000 pounds of gravel

10:33.500 --> 10:36.067
in his boat 14 miles upriver.

10:36.100 --> 10:38.833
We plan on living here
the rest of our lives,

10:38.867 --> 10:41.933
so we've had this cabin
planned for quite a few years,

10:41.967 --> 10:44.333
and it needs
a strong foundation.

10:45.200 --> 10:46.467
Like everything in life,

10:46.500 --> 10:49.400
if you have a good foundation
you can build a tall building,

10:51.033 --> 10:52.567
or a tall life.

10:53.600 --> 10:56.933
If any of these bags
tip over or flop over

10:56.967 --> 10:58.933
and throw
the centre of gravity
off on the boats,

10:58.967 --> 11:01.000
I can capsize the boat.

11:01.033 --> 11:02.700
So we'll see, once you
start working with

11:02.733 --> 11:04.500
heavy equipment
and heavy objects,

11:04.533 --> 11:06.300
you never know what
you're gonna run against.

11:14.267 --> 11:15.933
So I've got my
army boats together.

11:19.967 --> 11:21.933
It's time to pull them
into position.

11:21.967 --> 11:23.133
Secure them.

11:24.200 --> 11:25.967
Then I'm gonna need to
load these bags

11:26.000 --> 11:27.867
with the sky track
into the boats.

11:27.900 --> 11:29.400
That's Plan A.

11:30.767 --> 11:34.133
Plan B will be determined
once Plan A doesn't work.

11:35.433 --> 11:38.500
NARRATOR: Each bag of gravel
weighs 1,000 pounds.

11:38.533 --> 11:41.700
Andy will attempt to load
three to four bags per boat.

11:41.733 --> 11:43.033
(ENGINE RUNNING)

11:48.100 --> 11:49.700
The one thing I'm
a little worried about is

11:49.733 --> 11:51.133
as I start loading the boats,

11:51.167 --> 11:52.367
they're gonna
load differently.

11:52.400 --> 11:53.800
I'm gonna put my first load in

11:53.833 --> 11:55.167
and that boat's gonna go down.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.233
So that's gonna
tweak the other boat.

11:57.267 --> 11:59.033
Then I'll put another
bag in that one,

11:59.067 --> 12:00.733
and so the boats are gonna be

12:00.767 --> 12:02.800
wanting to tweak
quite a bit
in between loads,

12:02.833 --> 12:04.100
until I can even 'em up.

12:08.200 --> 12:09.733
NARRATOR: Adding too much
weight to the boats

12:09.767 --> 12:11.700
could cause them to
capsize and sink,

12:11.733 --> 12:13.933
along with Andy and
Kate's foundation

12:13.967 --> 12:15.433
for their dream home.

12:32.367 --> 12:34.467
I got a leak.

12:34.500 --> 12:35.767
It ain't gonna fucking work.

12:36.767 --> 12:38.500
Every bit of water
you get in a boat

12:38.533 --> 12:41.133
when you got a load
like this is dangerous.

12:41.167 --> 12:43.100
And the more water
that comes in

12:43.133 --> 12:44.467
the more water
I gotta worry about

12:44.500 --> 12:45.933
sloshing around in these boats

12:45.967 --> 12:48.933
while I'm going in the river
which affects my stability.

12:50.267 --> 12:53.233
So, I don't want a bunch
of water in this boat.

12:53.267 --> 12:55.333
I'm going to have to
pull a bag out of this.

12:55.367 --> 12:57.800
I can't go down river with
water coming in the boat,

12:57.833 --> 12:59.500
that's just asking
for trouble.

13:02.100 --> 13:03.500
I'm going to see
what it looks like.

13:03.533 --> 13:05.200
I might have to take
another one out.

13:05.233 --> 13:06.333
So we'll see what happens.

13:06.367 --> 13:09.933
This boat went through
the flood in 2004,

13:09.967 --> 13:14.533
and the ice pushed this
cleat through the hull.

13:14.567 --> 13:18.000
So when it gets down below
this point in the water

13:18.033 --> 13:19.900
it starts taking on water.

13:19.933 --> 13:22.733
I probably took on
about 20 gallons or so...

13:22.767 --> 13:24.933
30 gallons of water.

13:24.967 --> 13:27.067
So it's just gonna cost me
more time and more money

13:27.100 --> 13:29.167
to get the gravel down.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.800
NARRATOR: Andy must now haul
the 10,000 pounds of gravel

13:31.833 --> 13:34.333
through the fast-moving
currents of the Yukon

13:34.367 --> 13:36.233
without capsizing his boat.

13:39.800 --> 13:41.200
ANDY: When things
like that happen

13:41.233 --> 13:43.567
sometimes you got to
listen to them,
and don't push it.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.467
And so that's what I'm doing.

13:45.500 --> 13:47.367
Be safe instead of sorry.

13:47.400 --> 13:49.733
Uh, if I was to lose
these boats right now,

13:49.767 --> 13:51.500
my whole summer
would be screwed.

13:51.533 --> 13:54.333
There would no way I could
get all the materials down
to build that house.

13:56.133 --> 13:58.567
There's 80,000 pounds
of building materials

13:58.600 --> 14:00.200
I need to move downriver.

14:00.233 --> 14:01.567
Taking care of these boats

14:01.600 --> 14:04.133
is priority number one
for me right now.

14:05.100 --> 14:07.333
I feel okay with the way
the load is now.

14:07.367 --> 14:10.300
And hopefully we'll have
a good trip home.

14:13.567 --> 14:17.533
GLENN:
Humans are not adapted to
live in this kind of country.

14:19.167 --> 14:21.367
This is a very hard place
for a person to live.

14:28.467 --> 14:31.167
I might be about a third
of the way to the road now.

14:31.200 --> 14:33.167
I'm not thinking about how
many miles I walk each day,

14:33.200 --> 14:37.300
but I am thinking about
getting back to see my kids.

14:37.333 --> 14:39.700
And walking all day will
work up an appetite.

14:40.800 --> 14:44.633
I only got enough food
in my pack for one meal.

14:44.667 --> 14:47.533
A little bit of oatmeal.
A few pecans.

14:47.567 --> 14:48.667
A few raisins.

14:48.700 --> 14:50.867
Some dry pounded caribou meat.

14:50.900 --> 14:52.000
That's all I got left.

14:52.033 --> 14:53.433
I could eat it all at once,

14:53.467 --> 14:55.533
but I better not
eat right now.

14:55.567 --> 14:57.600
I can go a little longer.

14:59.933 --> 15:01.367
This is tussock tundra,

15:01.400 --> 15:03.167
and it's not easy
to walk through.

15:03.200 --> 15:05.000
Really the biggest
danger I have,

15:05.033 --> 15:07.133
walking around
out here by myself,

15:07.167 --> 15:09.333
is if I was to get hurt
and I couldn't walk any more.

15:09.367 --> 15:11.467
So, I'm always
thinking about that.

15:11.500 --> 15:14.600
I don't want to
twist my ankle or
screw up my knee.

15:14.633 --> 15:15.933
I gotta be able to
keep walking.

15:15.967 --> 15:17.167
That's one thing.

15:17.200 --> 15:19.200
You can't lose
your ability to walk out here.

15:19.233 --> 15:21.867
If you lose your ability
to walk when you're in town,

15:21.900 --> 15:23.400
it's not good.

15:23.433 --> 15:24.833
But it's not
the end of the world.

15:24.867 --> 15:27.067
There's plenty of people that
are going to help you out.

15:27.100 --> 15:30.000
But out here you do
have to be able to walk.

15:30.033 --> 15:32.567
If you can't walk,
you can't live.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.133
It's just such vast country.

15:36.167 --> 15:38.433
A person out here is just
a little dot on the tundra.

15:38.467 --> 15:42.133
I don't plan on anybody coming
out here with an aeroplane
and finding me.

15:42.167 --> 15:45.867
So I always think that
I have to be able to
get out of here by myself.

15:51.267 --> 15:52.600
Physically, I'm tired.

15:52.633 --> 15:54.300
My feet are starting
to bother me,

15:54.333 --> 15:56.800
and I have low energy
just from not eating all day.

15:56.833 --> 15:59.333
So I want to find
something to eat.

15:59.367 --> 16:01.867
No, I've never eaten
green blueberries.

16:01.900 --> 16:04.733
I just want to try them and
see if they're any good.

16:16.300 --> 16:17.733
They're not very good.

16:17.767 --> 16:19.233
Everything tastes better
when you're hungry.

16:19.267 --> 16:22.200
But not something I'd eat
if I had a lot of food.

16:24.767 --> 16:27.033
What I really need to find
is some animal food to eat.

16:30.100 --> 16:33.600
I have not eaten anything
other than a few leaves

16:33.633 --> 16:36.033
and some green berries.

16:36.967 --> 16:38.167
And it's getting late,

16:38.200 --> 16:40.300
and I'm tired and
I'm ready to go to bed.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.867
And this is the place where
possibly there's some fish.

16:54.700 --> 16:57.400
I don't know if there's
anything in here.

17:00.367 --> 17:03.667
I think up here the fishing
is probably not that good.

17:05.533 --> 17:06.767
There's something.

17:10.900 --> 17:12.233
There is one there!

17:17.367 --> 17:18.367
Oh, oh, oh!

17:29.833 --> 17:31.267
Boy, he almost got away!

17:31.300 --> 17:33.133
A little tricky
when you don't have a net.

17:35.000 --> 17:39.033
That's a good fish,
but I'm really low on food.

17:39.067 --> 17:41.867
I'm hungry enough to eat
two or three of those, easy.

17:41.900 --> 17:43.700
I almost lost dinner.

17:47.633 --> 17:49.467
That fish weighed
more than my fishing pole

17:49.500 --> 17:51.833
so the fishing pole has
already paid for itself.

17:53.267 --> 17:55.133
It was worth carrying.

18:02.967 --> 18:05.467
If I hadn't caught fish,
I was gonna go to bed hungry.

18:05.500 --> 18:08.267
I had a little bit
of food left,
but I was gonna save it.

18:08.300 --> 18:10.333
I still have
a long ways to walk.

18:12.267 --> 18:14.100
I'm hoping for one more
night out here

18:14.133 --> 18:15.967
to make it to the road.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.800
It's just getting harder
because of my food situation.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.400
CHIP: Actually this kind of
living, you know...

18:22.433 --> 18:25.267
There's killers
and there's accomplices.

18:25.300 --> 18:27.333
If you are not a killer,
somewhere down the road

18:27.367 --> 18:30.233
if you eat meat or fish
you're an accomplice.

18:43.267 --> 18:45.567
We use nets 'cause
we're in rivers
and such here...

18:45.600 --> 18:47.933
And, um, as I was growing up

18:47.967 --> 18:50.433
I used a fishing rod.

18:50.467 --> 18:54.400
So my wife is always
in charge of any such
nettings.

18:55.800 --> 18:58.133
So when we're setting a net,
we're setting it her way.

18:59.100 --> 19:01.000
We're doing this
the Inupiat way.

19:01.033 --> 19:03.267
We'll be checking the nets
a couple of times a day,

19:03.300 --> 19:07.167
so we're expecting
hopefully 20 or 30
fish a day.

19:07.200 --> 19:08.400
Hopefully, it's a good run.

19:08.433 --> 19:10.867
That's what we are hoping for.
We're hoping for a good run.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.800
We got the place.
We got the equipment.

19:12.833 --> 19:14.733
We're here at the right time.

19:14.767 --> 19:16.333
Salmon are in the river.

19:17.300 --> 19:18.833
Best bet is to
just set the net,

19:18.867 --> 19:19.900
and see what we get.

19:23.233 --> 19:24.700
Got the rope?

19:24.733 --> 19:26.300
Means a lot to me 'cause
I sure like salmon,

19:26.333 --> 19:28.133
and that's a lot of food
I don't have to buy.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.433
So instead of buying food,
I can buy fuel,

19:30.467 --> 19:33.067
or I can buy shoes or
something else with my money.

19:33.100 --> 19:34.367
I can skip all
the grocery shopping

19:34.400 --> 19:35.600
and do my shopping now.

19:35.633 --> 19:37.267
Fishing, hunting...

19:37.300 --> 19:39.400
It's all out looking for food.

19:39.433 --> 19:40.800
It's like going down
the aisles.

19:57.267 --> 19:59.400
The strategy is that my wife
is now tightening the net

19:59.433 --> 20:01.333
so that we're not
halfway across the river

20:01.367 --> 20:02.900
and blocking
too much of the river.

20:02.933 --> 20:04.100
Ting, give her a hand.

20:04.133 --> 20:05.933
She needs some
serious help right now.

20:09.367 --> 20:10.533
And pull.

20:15.067 --> 20:16.967
CHIP: Careful.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.300
You guys watch
what your mom is doing.

20:19.333 --> 20:20.567
It's important to learn.

20:20.600 --> 20:23.633
First you observe and then
you put your hands on it.

20:23.667 --> 20:26.200
Let you know what's up
and what's at stake here,

20:26.233 --> 20:28.133
and my wife really knows
what's going on here.

20:29.867 --> 20:31.233
CHIP: Whatever works.

20:31.267 --> 20:32.833
We're all following
her tired direction.

20:32.867 --> 20:34.900
She's not awake yet.
(CHUCKLES)

20:36.733 --> 20:38.600
ANDY: Often times
it's the prep work

20:38.633 --> 20:41.533
that's really
the hard work for me.

20:41.567 --> 20:43.433
The building part
is the easy part.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.033
I can see our home.

20:54.067 --> 20:56.100
Haven't capsized,
I haven't swamped,

20:56.133 --> 20:57.467
my feet are dry.

20:57.500 --> 20:58.867
So we're doing good so far.

21:02.433 --> 21:06.467
NARRATOR:
Andy has successfully gotten
his 10,000-pound load home.

21:06.500 --> 21:09.833
Now, he has to safely haul
the gravel to shore.

21:12.667 --> 21:15.500
ANDY: Take that one up and
tie it to the same place!

21:17.333 --> 21:18.667
That's it!

21:23.700 --> 21:25.200
This is about half of it.

21:34.567 --> 21:37.800
I had to build this boom
for the back of my bulldozer,

21:37.833 --> 21:41.267
so that I had a way to get
these bags off of the boats,

21:41.300 --> 21:44.133
and I took this old
winch and set it up.

21:46.100 --> 21:48.667
And then the boom is set up
to my front bucket,

21:48.700 --> 21:50.733
so I'll be able to raise
and lower the boom

21:50.767 --> 21:52.100
with the front bucket.

21:52.133 --> 21:53.700
The big challenge now
will be...

21:53.733 --> 21:55.800
Is do I have enough
of a reach out over the river

21:55.833 --> 21:57.567
to pick the bags up
out of the boat...

21:57.600 --> 22:01.567
And that's mainly what
I'm concerned about here.

22:11.600 --> 22:13.500
I don't know that
that's a good idea.

22:19.200 --> 22:21.867
NARRATOR: Each bag of gravel
weighs up to a half ton.

22:21.900 --> 22:24.800
But if Andy's makeshift crane
can't support the weight,

22:24.833 --> 22:28.833
the bulldozer could tip over
and pin Andy underneath.

22:36.467 --> 22:38.967
KATE: The tracks are lifting
about 4 inches.

22:40.200 --> 22:41.867
That's a little too high.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.233
Andy!

22:47.267 --> 22:48.700
You're coming up!

22:51.467 --> 22:53.667
All these little things
are going through my head

22:53.700 --> 22:56.167
as I'm doing this,
and it's just insane.

23:00.867 --> 23:03.400
I don't want this tractor
to fall backwards.

23:03.433 --> 23:07.367
Andy would just go
arse over kettle,
and he will be flat.

23:13.033 --> 23:14.133
No!

23:16.167 --> 23:17.433
Andy!

23:29.633 --> 23:31.300
Down she goes... All right!

23:31.333 --> 23:32.533
Happy dance!

23:33.833 --> 23:36.433
It was damn scary there
for a second.

23:41.600 --> 23:43.033
That went well.

23:43.467 --> 23:44.633
Marginal.

23:47.300 --> 23:48.633
Go up!

23:49.867 --> 23:51.867
ANDY: So far
it's working... Barely.

23:51.900 --> 23:54.933
The winch is barely
able to pull these up
out of the boat,

23:54.967 --> 23:56.400
but it's making it.

23:56.433 --> 23:58.700
And, uh, the brakes are
holding on the tractor,

23:58.733 --> 24:00.133
that's what I'm really
worried about is...

24:00.167 --> 24:02.900
I'm really having to
put a lot of pressure
on the brakes

24:02.933 --> 24:05.667
to hold me in that position
while I'm lifting,

24:05.700 --> 24:07.500
but so far so good.

24:07.533 --> 24:10.100
We got three more
bags to get out,

24:10.133 --> 24:12.667
and then we can
call it Miller time.

24:12.700 --> 24:15.167
I like it when
my inventions work.

24:15.200 --> 24:18.533
Sometimes I do these things
and they're all fucked up.

24:18.567 --> 24:19.667
Feels good!

24:35.467 --> 24:36.833
ANDY: Yay!

24:36.867 --> 24:38.767
You did it!

24:38.800 --> 24:41.067
-You did it.
-Barely worked, barely worked.

24:41.100 --> 24:44.267
Barely. Oh... Thank you.

24:45.633 --> 24:47.567
-Good job!
-Yeah.

24:47.600 --> 24:49.567
You're amazing.

24:50.500 --> 24:53.067
You can do anything.

24:53.100 --> 24:54.967
Like lifting you up
on the gravel.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.367
-There's your foundation.
-(LAUGHING)

24:57.400 --> 24:59.067
Hope you enjoy it.

25:00.300 --> 25:03.200
And he built it all himself.

25:03.233 --> 25:05.467
Just me and my welder
and a bit of grinding,

25:05.500 --> 25:08.533
a bit of welding,
a bit of cutting,

25:08.567 --> 25:09.733
a bit of swearing.

25:09.767 --> 25:11.500
You know, we have enough
bags here right now,

25:11.533 --> 25:13.400
we can get a good start
on the foundation.

25:13.433 --> 25:14.633
So it's a good feeling.

25:14.667 --> 25:16.667
I mean, we've been talking
about this for a long time.

25:20.067 --> 25:22.300
KATE: That's the beginning
of our new house, baby.

25:22.333 --> 25:24.567
ANDY: It only cost us
a thousand fucking dollars.

25:24.600 --> 25:26.633
Well, you know what?

25:26.667 --> 25:29.433
I'm worth it.

25:29.467 --> 25:31.733
SUE: You know,
there is no guarantees
and I accept that.

25:31.767 --> 25:33.267
But life's not worth living

25:33.300 --> 25:35.000
if you don't push
a boundary or two.

25:49.367 --> 25:52.333
The rule is if I want
to live out here,

25:52.367 --> 25:53.533
I have to run a business.

25:53.567 --> 25:54.633
There's a saying that,

25:54.667 --> 25:56.233
"When somebody
starts a business,

25:56.267 --> 25:59.233
"expect to, you know,
lose money the first
three to five years

25:59.267 --> 26:01.633
"while you're getting
your feet underneath you..."

26:01.667 --> 26:04.300
So, you know, you got to
make sure you have
your capital to do that.

26:04.333 --> 26:06.400
And I really
don't have that luxury.

26:06.433 --> 26:07.733
So I've got to make it go.

26:07.767 --> 26:09.767
I've got to make
it profitable.
It's a challenge.

26:09.800 --> 26:13.933
I don't have the room to fail.

26:13.967 --> 26:16.900
Planes in the area,
I'm an emergency
fuel station for them.

26:16.933 --> 26:20.133
The only one
for a hundred miles.

26:20.167 --> 26:24.100
I've been out of aviation gas
for about a week now.

26:24.133 --> 26:25.600
And there's people
stuck out in the field,

26:25.633 --> 26:28.900
no way to get in
because the planes
can't get fuel.

26:28.933 --> 26:30.633
NARRATOR: Alaska's
unpredictable weather

26:30.667 --> 26:33.300
has delayed Sue's
regular fuel shipment.

26:33.333 --> 26:36.167
Until it arrives,
her customers are grounded.

26:36.867 --> 26:38.167
Hey, buddy?

26:38.200 --> 26:40.400
I know you're waiting on fuel,

26:40.433 --> 26:43.967
but I talked to the plane
and Everetts said they're
gonna try again today.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.933
You going to be okay with
hanging around
for a little while?

26:45.967 --> 26:48.100
-They're gonna make it today?
-Yeah, they're hoping to.

26:48.133 --> 26:50.467
I mean, the thing
that worries me is
I can see snow over here,

26:50.500 --> 26:53.000
if it comes down
we're pooched another day.

26:53.033 --> 26:54.733
Well, we're getting low.
We're going to need it.

26:54.767 --> 26:57.367
Yeah, well, I'm out.
Whatever you got
is what you got.

26:57.400 --> 26:58.800
I got enough to do
one more round,

26:58.833 --> 27:00.700
and I got four guys
standing out there
waiting to come in.

27:02.100 --> 27:03.467
SUE: I'm under the gun.

27:03.500 --> 27:04.800
All these planes you see here

27:04.833 --> 27:06.367
have been grounded
for days now.

27:06.400 --> 27:08.267
People stranded out
in the field.

27:08.300 --> 27:09.567
Winter storm's coming in.

27:09.600 --> 27:11.467
Once the snow flies,
really, I mean,

27:11.500 --> 27:13.067
they wrap it up and go away.

27:13.100 --> 27:15.433
So I've got two,
three months, maybe,

27:15.467 --> 27:17.167
to make 12 months
worth of revenue.

27:17.200 --> 27:19.100
Fuel is critical.

27:19.133 --> 27:20.933
The planes can't get
in the air,
the people can't move.

27:20.967 --> 27:23.500
People can't move,
they don't pay you to get
where they're going.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.600
Hey, 22 Mike,
you got a copy
on Kavik yet?

27:35.433 --> 27:39.000
22 Mike Everts,
this is Kavik,
do you got a copy?

27:40.400 --> 27:41.633
Not yet.

27:46.267 --> 27:48.000
(STATIC)

27:48.033 --> 27:50.133
Hey, 22 Mike, was that you?

27:58.500 --> 28:01.067
22 Mike, you got
a copy on Kavik?

28:01.100 --> 28:02.800
MIKE: Oh, yeah, go ahead, Sue.

28:02.833 --> 28:05.433
Hey, buddy,
it's awful good
to hear from ya.

28:05.467 --> 28:07.233
I've got some planes
that'll be awful happy

28:07.267 --> 28:09.567
-to get back up
off the ground.
-Okay.

28:10.967 --> 28:12.933
You just fly safe
and thank you, thank you.

28:12.967 --> 28:14.533
You guys always
save my biscuits.

28:18.133 --> 28:22.767
The AV gas,
the aviation 100 low lead
is on its way in.

28:22.800 --> 28:24.200
Booyah!

28:24.233 --> 28:26.367
These little planes can get
about doing their business,

28:26.400 --> 28:28.767
start getting people
out of the field
that are cold and hungry.

28:28.800 --> 28:30.867
Yeah, there he is.

28:30.900 --> 28:33.633
That bird right there,
good old Salmonella.

28:33.667 --> 28:36.067
1942 World War II aircraft

28:36.100 --> 28:38.600
flying my fuel in,
it's gonna save their bacon.

28:39.667 --> 28:41.267
Boom! And he's down.

28:44.167 --> 28:46.167
Just getting 2,000 gallons.

28:46.200 --> 28:49.267
I'll go through three quarters
of that in the next 10 days

28:49.300 --> 28:51.733
and then save,
barrel up the rest.

28:51.767 --> 28:53.933
I'm getting 2,000 gallons
of jet fuel.

28:53.967 --> 28:57.200
It'll take me another 6,000
to get through the winter,

28:57.233 --> 28:58.833
as long and cold
as my winters are.

28:58.867 --> 29:01.433
So you don't do this kind
of a lifestyle by mistake.

29:01.467 --> 29:03.233
I work for my
three months a year

29:03.267 --> 29:06.900
to pay for the place
and make enough revenue
just to buy a style of life.

29:06.933 --> 29:08.667
You know, I'm not
out to get rich.

29:08.700 --> 29:10.133
I just want to be me.

29:10.167 --> 29:16.400
I'm standing on top of
about 3,946 gallons.

29:16.433 --> 29:18.733
MAN: How many dollars?

29:18.767 --> 29:21.167
$21,000, $22,000...
Somewhere around there.

29:23.133 --> 29:25.900
-Awesome. Thank you, Sue.
-I really appreciate it.

29:25.933 --> 29:27.500
You always
come through for me.

29:31.000 --> 29:34.700
These guys, the big birds,
they're the ones
who take care of me.

29:34.733 --> 29:38.533
It's a big deal.
I mean, it's a service
that I run here.

29:38.567 --> 29:41.800
If you don't have fuel
from the Haul road
all the way to Canada,

29:41.833 --> 29:42.867
I'm it.

29:42.900 --> 29:45.333
And for me to be
out of fuel is a danger.

29:45.367 --> 29:48.600
So I feel better knowing
all my birdies can get back
to the nest now.

29:51.700 --> 29:55.700
Just like me,
she's an old bitch,
but she still likes to smoke.

29:57.700 --> 29:59.567
Booyah! Kavik's open
for business.

29:59.600 --> 30:01.500
CHIP: Travel is
always an education.

30:01.533 --> 30:02.767
No matter where you go
when you travel,

30:02.800 --> 30:04.133
you're learning something.

30:04.167 --> 30:06.167
I want my kids to learn
as much about the world
as they can,

30:06.200 --> 30:07.667
so when they get older
they'll have choices.

30:12.200 --> 30:15.200
NARRATOR:
With winter close at hand,
the Hailstones are hoping

30:15.233 --> 30:16.967
for a sizable catch
of fresh salmon

30:17.000 --> 30:19.200
to last them through
the coming freeze.

30:19.233 --> 30:20.400
AGNES: Hook it, miss Mary.

30:20.433 --> 30:22.300
This is the time to get fish
while they're here,

30:22.333 --> 30:24.433
and while they're
healthy and fat.

30:27.900 --> 30:29.067
Whoa!

30:29.100 --> 30:30.167
CAROL: Oh, yeah!

30:30.200 --> 30:31.433
AGNES: It's alive.

30:33.800 --> 30:35.700
AGNES: It's not
rainy season yet

30:35.733 --> 30:37.333
and then our fish
are able to dry.

30:37.367 --> 30:38.733
Because in the next
couple of weeks

30:38.767 --> 30:40.200
the rainy season will come,

30:40.233 --> 30:42.233
and then there'll be all
this moisture in the air

30:42.267 --> 30:43.767
and nothing's
going to dry then.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.733
So, that's why we do it now.

30:46.933 --> 30:47.933
There's one down there.

30:49.100 --> 30:50.133
Hey!

30:52.700 --> 30:54.133
That was a tough one.

30:56.233 --> 30:57.333
Mom, there's two right here.

30:58.267 --> 30:59.300
I got one.

31:04.700 --> 31:07.000
Are we gonna have
enough room for
the fish in that tub?

31:07.033 --> 31:09.567
Tub is full and we're only
half way through the net.

31:13.967 --> 31:15.533
CHIP: There's a good
bounty of fish.

31:15.567 --> 31:16.933
(AGNES SPEAKING)

31:16.967 --> 31:18.633
CHIP: This is natural food,
this is healthy food.

31:18.667 --> 31:19.867
And it gives them culture,

31:19.900 --> 31:23.900
a sense of well-being
and a sense of satisfaction

31:23.933 --> 31:25.433
when they're done.

31:25.467 --> 31:29.500
And a good sense of just
where food comes from.

31:32.467 --> 31:35.767
AGNES: We try to catch
a whole bunch to begin with
and dry them up,

31:35.800 --> 31:38.100
so they'll keep
for the rest of the season

31:38.133 --> 31:41.200
and we'll put those
in our freezers
for the winter.

31:44.667 --> 31:46.533

No part of the fish
is wasted.

31:46.567 --> 31:50.800

What isn't eaten now

31:52.267 --> 31:55.333
is dried and stored
for the winter
that looms ahead.

31:58.267 --> 32:00.433
Any ones that have
a lot of fat in them,

32:00.467 --> 32:03.133
after we dry them,
we put them in our seal oil,

32:03.167 --> 32:05.967
so they don't get rancid
and get too strong.

32:11.067 --> 32:12.733

sawing, you push.

32:17.233 --> 32:19.967
Push with your
whole arm, yeah.

32:23.467 --> 32:25.000
QUTAN: Do I need to finish it?

32:25.033 --> 32:26.433
I got it.

32:28.667 --> 32:30.467
I'm very proud
of my daughters.

32:30.500 --> 32:32.233
Try to teach them what I know

32:32.267 --> 32:33.867
and then by the time
they're my age

32:33.900 --> 32:36.800
they'll pretty much have it
all down to where
they're doing it by themselves

32:36.833 --> 32:40.200
without me guiding them
or instructing them.

32:40.233 --> 32:42.600
You do what's right
and take what's left.

a long stick and push it?

32:50.333 --> 32:52.367
Just throw it on,

the mosquitoes away.

33:00.833 --> 33:06.567

the bellies, the eggs
from the fish.

50 fish, I'm satisfied...

plenty salmon for now.

Get away.

33:23.633 --> 33:25.467
Iri, I'm much faster than you.

33:25.500 --> 33:28.867
We travel around and gather
and hunt in all kinds of
different places,

33:28.900 --> 33:30.567
but we always come back
to the same places.

33:30.600 --> 33:32.400
You know, people have been
doing that for
thousands of years.

33:32.433 --> 33:34.133
People still do it today.

33:34.167 --> 33:35.267
I like living this way.

33:35.300 --> 33:37.267
I like making it to where

33:37.300 --> 33:40.200
I can just do things
on my own, for myself
and for my kids

33:40.233 --> 33:41.700
and teach them
and take them along.

33:41.733 --> 33:44.400
-What the heck...
-Good job!

33:44.433 --> 33:45.867
CHIP: I think it's important
they see that.

33:45.900 --> 33:47.433
That they live it,
that they touch it.

33:47.467 --> 33:50.300
So if they end up with no job,
the economy tanks out,

33:50.333 --> 33:52.633
I want my kids to be able to
know the resources as well.

33:52.667 --> 33:54.533
So, if they need to,
they can choose it

33:54.567 --> 33:55.633

GLENN: The reality is that
if something went wrong
10 minutes from now,

34:10.067 --> 34:13.467
I could be laying on
the tundra with the grey jays
pecking my eyes out

34:13.500 --> 34:15.300
and nobody would notice.

34:23.633 --> 34:25.300
This morning I woke up,
and I was thinking,

34:25.333 --> 34:30.400
"Wow, I'm gonna get back
to the road today, hopefully."

34:30.433 --> 34:34.267
It's been over 10 months
since I walked away
from that road.

34:34.300 --> 34:35.800
Just started sinking in
right now,

34:35.833 --> 34:39.033
that I'm going back
to civilisation.

34:48.533 --> 34:50.300
That's the last
of my food right here.

34:54.233 --> 34:56.100
Some dried caribou meat.

34:57.933 --> 34:59.933
I'm not anticipating
any big problem.

34:59.967 --> 35:01.433
It's just a matter of putting

35:01.467 --> 35:02.767
one foot in front
of the other.

35:02.800 --> 35:04.233
Getting across the tundra.

35:07.167 --> 35:08.833
That's it.

35:08.867 --> 35:11.467
That's the last of my food.

The last thing standing

35:12.767 --> 35:14.567
between Glenn

of the Chandalar River.

35:20.467 --> 35:21.867
GLENN: There's the river.

35:21.900 --> 35:24.367
The biggest problem
I'm worried about now

35:24.400 --> 35:26.933
would just be
if there's too deep of water.

35:28.433 --> 35:31.500
From up here,
I can't tell for sure

35:31.533 --> 35:33.333
how much of a problem
the river's gonna be.

35:33.367 --> 35:36.200
I gotta get down closer
and look at how much water
is running down there.

35:39.567 --> 35:41.667
Looks like there's still
ice along there.

35:44.233 --> 35:46.267
Oh, wow, there is a lot of ice
down there.

35:46.300 --> 35:47.767
I have never
seen it like this.

35:49.433 --> 35:51.933
I have never seen ice
that thick at this time
of year.

35:54.300 --> 35:56.133
I've been through here
in the summer.

35:56.167 --> 35:58.100
I've never seen
ice here at all.

35:59.267 --> 36:00.400
That's amazing.

36:00.433 --> 36:02.833
Looks like it's more than
six feet thick.

36:02.867 --> 36:04.933
This is my biggest concern
is not being able

36:04.967 --> 36:06.300
to get across this river.

36:06.333 --> 36:08.733
'Cause if I can't
get across this river,
I got problems.

36:08.767 --> 36:12.467
I got to turn around and walk
all the way back to my camp.

36:12.500 --> 36:14.667
That's too far.
I don't have food left.

36:16.667 --> 36:19.533
Just walk upstream
and see if there's a place
where I can get across.

36:25.033 --> 36:27.933
NARRATOR: Glenn has to find
a clearing in shallow water,

36:27.967 --> 36:29.967
or he won't be able to
cross the river.

36:38.667 --> 36:40.867
This looks like a place
I can get across.

36:42.533 --> 36:45.167
There's no ice to climb up
on the other side at least.

36:48.233 --> 36:51.467
It'd be nice if it was even
shallower and not running
so fast.

36:51.500 --> 36:52.767
I'll give it a try.

37:20.700 --> 37:21.933
Made it!

37:24.467 --> 37:26.867
I'm starting to get excited
about getting back.

37:26.900 --> 37:28.500
It just started sinking in
right now

37:28.533 --> 37:31.000
that I'm actually going back
to civilisation.

37:31.033 --> 37:32.600
Actually going to see
a bunch of people

37:32.633 --> 37:34.367
I haven't seen
in almost a year.

37:35.400 --> 37:37.800
I started wondering
this morning,

37:37.833 --> 37:40.333
how much different
my kids look.

37:40.367 --> 37:41.900
I haven't seen them
in so long.

37:43.433 --> 37:46.500
Getting close now.
This is real familiar country.

37:46.533 --> 37:48.200
I can see the road.

37:48.233 --> 37:49.733
I'm almost there!

37:49.767 --> 37:51.600
I'm gonna head up and see
if I can get a ride.

37:54.100 --> 37:56.500
It's not easy to get
a lift up here, necessarily

37:56.533 --> 37:58.133
when you're carrying a rifle,

37:58.167 --> 37:59.533
and you're all
dirty and smelly

37:59.567 --> 38:01.233
the way I am after this walk.

38:03.867 --> 38:05.467
Made it to the road.

38:05.767 --> 38:06.933
(SIGHS)

38:07.733 --> 38:09.300
That was a bit of a walk.

38:12.933 --> 38:13.933
Wow.

38:15.033 --> 38:16.700
Just got to wait until
a truck or a car

38:16.733 --> 38:18.567
comes down this highway.

38:18.600 --> 38:20.300
Try to hitch a ride
to Fairbanks.

38:22.367 --> 38:23.600
It's exciting
to get to the road

38:23.633 --> 38:26.100
after being out here
over 10 months.

38:26.133 --> 38:28.267
But I don't mind
going to town,

38:28.300 --> 38:30.267
but I just don't want to
live there.

38:31.367 --> 38:33.233
I feel like I'm kind of
half alive.

38:33.267 --> 38:35.933
Like I'm kind of caged up
down there.

38:38.967 --> 38:43.133
Not easy for me
to leave the place.

38:43.167 --> 38:45.700
You know, knowing I might not
be back for a while.

38:49.500 --> 38:52.867
ANDY: We both love this place,
and we don't want to
leave this place.

38:52.900 --> 38:56.367
If I can make
a comfortable and easy living
down here,

38:56.400 --> 38:59.200
we can stay here for the rest
of our lives if we want.

39:03.167 --> 39:05.233
(DOG BARKING IN THE DISTANCE)

39:07.100 --> 39:11.033
So, Andy, are we just going
to dump this right in the hole
or in buckets or...

39:11.067 --> 39:12.300
(ANDY GRUNTS)

39:12.333 --> 39:14.833
From the mixer
to the wheelbarrow
to the hole.

39:14.867 --> 39:16.067
KATE: Okay.

39:16.100 --> 39:17.200
Easy as possible.

39:18.167 --> 39:19.200
Sounds like a plan.

39:22.100 --> 39:24.267
ANDY: I moved about
10,000 pounds of gravel

39:24.300 --> 39:25.700
from the river up to here.

39:25.733 --> 39:28.500
And my next process
in the building of the house

39:28.533 --> 39:32.000
is to get this
concrete poured
and this foundation set.

39:35.033 --> 39:36.700
Our summers
are very short here.

39:36.733 --> 39:39.567
So there's a lot of pressure
and a lot of stress on me

39:39.600 --> 39:41.033
to try and get these
things done.

39:41.067 --> 39:42.733
And I'm probably my
worst enemy

39:42.767 --> 39:45.567
because I'm Type A
and I want everything
done yesterday.

39:49.533 --> 39:51.533
Pouring concrete
isn't rocket science,

39:51.567 --> 39:53.400
but the mix
can be pretty critical.

39:53.433 --> 39:55.133
We don't have the advantage
of having

39:55.167 --> 39:57.233
all of the ingredients cleaned

39:57.267 --> 39:59.267
like they would
in an urban environment.

39:59.300 --> 40:02.000
This is going to be
a pretty large home
that it's sitting on.

40:02.033 --> 40:03.600
So, bottom line,
I've got to get

40:03.633 --> 40:06.200
the cement/gravel
ratios correct.

40:06.233 --> 40:09.067
I have to get the right
consistency of water correct.

40:11.700 --> 40:13.367
It's gonna need more water.

40:21.267 --> 40:22.967
That will be wet enough,
probably.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.500
You want a quick dump
or a slow dump?

40:24.533 --> 40:26.400
No, do it relatively slow.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.167
Good!

40:36.667 --> 40:38.400
Pretty much just pour
that concrete,

40:38.433 --> 40:39.967
level it out,
then let it cure.

40:41.767 --> 40:44.033
KATE:
This day has finally come.

40:44.067 --> 40:47.333
I'm really excited.
I can hardly stop wiggling.

40:49.067 --> 40:51.867
I was excited four years ago
when we were gonna start,

40:51.900 --> 40:53.467
but, you know,
the flood of '09

40:53.500 --> 40:55.200
had a different idea for us,

40:55.233 --> 40:57.367
and we actually
had to start over again.

40:57.400 --> 41:00.000
And that was
about as frustrating
as life can get,

41:00.033 --> 41:02.500
but I'm getting what I wanted
four years ago.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.700
My dream home.

41:04.733 --> 41:08.033
So the bottom of my house
is going to be about
this high off the ground,

41:08.067 --> 41:11.200
and that's because this is
the highest piece of ground
around here.

41:11.233 --> 41:12.633
Worst case scenario, we'll get

41:12.667 --> 41:14.800
a little bit of water
on the bottom floor
of our house,

41:14.833 --> 41:16.433
but everything else
will be okay.

41:16.467 --> 41:18.533
So, that's plan A.

41:18.567 --> 41:20.133
B, C, D and E.

41:20.167 --> 41:22.667
'Cause once
this house is done,
it's done.

41:22.700 --> 41:24.433
If it ever gets knocked off
the foundation

41:24.467 --> 41:27.233
we're buying a sailboat
and moving to the Caribbean.

41:27.267 --> 41:29.400
Here, you can put
the last rock in.

41:30.300 --> 41:31.767
Rock of ages.

41:34.633 --> 41:36.200
ANDY: This might be
our last load.

41:41.467 --> 41:43.367
Foundations are done now.

41:43.400 --> 41:44.967
Concrete's all poured.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.767
Everything went pretty well
doing that.

41:46.800 --> 41:49.333
Although this gravel job
was a really big job.

41:49.367 --> 41:52.033
It's just the very beginning
of this whole process.

41:53.167 --> 41:54.233
I'm starting to feel like

41:54.267 --> 41:55.600
things are coming
together here.

41:55.633 --> 41:57.667
I'm feeling like once
we get this home built,

41:57.700 --> 41:59.267
we're gonna be
in pretty good shape

41:59.300 --> 42:01.000
and I can maybe
slow down a little bit.

42:04.133 --> 42:06.533
My body's starting to
wear down from all this work.

42:06.567 --> 42:09.000
Every morning I wake up
and if my back's sore,

42:09.033 --> 42:11.767
I hear that clock going...
Tick, tick, tick, tick.

42:11.800 --> 42:15.000
And I want to finish
these projects
before the clock runs out.

42:17.533 --> 42:19.433
Is this gonna be
our corner stone?

42:20.833 --> 42:22.067
One of them.

42:22.667 --> 42:24.100
One of four corners.

42:24.133 --> 42:26.600
We got to be
our names and date.

42:26.633 --> 42:29.200
So in 500 years,
they'll know we were here.

42:29.800 --> 42:31.033
Who the hell will care?

42:33.500 --> 42:36.967
KATE: My life with Andy
is like a big old
roller coaster.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.100
I think I'm the luckiest woman
in the world,

42:39.133 --> 42:43.767
because for his temper,
he's equally as funny,

42:43.800 --> 42:45.233
he's equally as charming,

42:45.267 --> 42:47.700
he's equally as romantic
and kind.

42:47.733 --> 42:50.333
He makes me smile.
He makes me happy.

42:51.900 --> 42:52.867
My house.
