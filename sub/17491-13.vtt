<i>Hop aboard the fun train.</i>

10:33.549 --> 10:34.842
{\an3}<i>- Okay.</i>

10:34.925 --> 10:38.304
<i>- Wheee!</i>
<i>- Aaah!</i>

10:38.387 --> 10:41.223
<i>- Yay! Ah-ha-ha!</i>

10:41.307 --> 10:42.850
<i>- [sobbing]</i>

10:42.933 --> 10:47.563
- Ho, ho, ho.
That is some prime-time goat.

10:47.646 --> 10:50.066
- [cackles]
Since the beginning of time,

10:50.149 --> 10:51.400
man has dreamed
of combining hamsters

10:51.484 --> 10:55.071
with egg salad sandwiches.

10:55.154 --> 10:56.489
- Hey, Cricket.

10:56.572 --> 10:57.990
<i>Whoo.</i>

10:58.074 --> 10:59.241
<i>- Oh!</i>

10:59.325 --> 11:02.411
<i>[babbling indistinctly]</i>

11:02.495 --> 11:06.082
<i>Oops.</i>
<i>But you got that, right?</i>

11:06.165 --> 11:09.085
- Eh, eh...

11:09.168 --> 11:10.586
{\an3}No.

11:10.669 --> 11:12.630
Ahh!

11:12.713 --> 11:14.006
- Great news, Goat.

11:14.090 --> 11:17.259
{\an1}You've got the number one show
in Dumble-ville.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.261
- Superstar!
What's next?

11:19.345 --> 11:21.597
{\an3}You tell me, and I will just
go ahead and do it.

11:21.680 --> 11:24.016
- Ho, ho, ho,
fantabulous.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.893
Now, for the season finale,

11:25.976 --> 11:28.437
we want you to kick your friends

11:28.521 --> 11:31.565
out of the tree house.

11:31.649 --> 11:32.817
- Yeah! What?

11:37.029 --> 11:38.447
[together]
Ahh!

11:38.531 --> 11:40.533
- [sighs]

11:40.616 --> 11:41.784
Kick out my friends?

11:41.867 --> 11:43.369
You mean these friends?

11:43.452 --> 11:45.579
You flim-flam
flurbing flubert.

11:45.663 --> 11:47.581
I love these guys.

11:47.665 --> 11:49.625
They're way, way,
way more important

11:49.708 --> 11:54.463
than your stupid reality show,
so stuff it, Dumble dink!

11:54.547 --> 11:56.632
[together]
Ehh...ooh.

11:56.715 --> 11:58.634
- Sorry I've been
acting a little weird.

11:58.717 --> 12:00.302
I just wanted the tiny people

12:00.386 --> 12:03.848
that lived under the tree next
to the Mud Munchkins to like me.

12:03.931 --> 12:06.392
- Okay,
that makes perfect sense.

12:06.475 --> 12:08.561
{\an3}- You should have just
said that in the beginning.

12:08.644 --> 12:09.687
- Oh, you're finished, Goat.

12:09.770 --> 12:12.481
You'll never work
in Dumble-ville again.

12:12.565 --> 12:15.901
And your friend's butt sandwich
tastes like garbage.

12:15.985 --> 12:19.780
Besides, we already have
a new star picked out,

12:19.864 --> 12:22.950
Quandarious Gooch.

12:23.033 --> 12:25.453
- Let's get Goochy!

12:25.536 --> 12:27.163
{\an1}- Whee!

12:27.246 --> 12:29.498
If you need me,
you can always find me

12:29.582 --> 12:31.417
in the deep blackness of space,

12:31.500 --> 12:34.336
but I will exist
in the yesterday of tomorrow

12:34.420 --> 12:37.840
to punch the planet
of the future.

12:42.678 --> 12:45.014
The universe
will cry out for a hero,

12:45.097 --> 12:47.141
and I will whisper back to it,

12:47.224 --> 12:51.145
"Chew, swallow, eject."

12:53.856 --> 12:55.274
- I'd watch that.

12:58.527 --> 12:59.820
- Where are you going, Goat?

12:59.904 --> 13:01.322
Want to do something?

13:01.405 --> 13:03.032
- Sorry, off to do some errands.

13:03.115 --> 13:05.159
Oh, do you want anything?
- Actually--

13:05.242 --> 13:06.702
- No? Great. Bye.
Love you. Mean it.

13:06.785 --> 13:10.164
{\an1}- Goat, you dropped your...
diary.

13:10.247 --> 13:11.624
Goat,
come back here right now

13:11.707 --> 13:14.502
if you don't want me
to read this.

13:14.585 --> 13:16.212
Beh!
- Open it.

13:16.295 --> 13:19.215
- I can't, right?

13:19.298 --> 13:22.218
{\an1}- No, do what he says
and open it.

13:22.301 --> 13:23.844
- I couldn't do that to goat,

13:23.928 --> 13:29.016
unless the diary fell
and happened to pop open.

13:29.099 --> 13:30.434
Whoops.

13:32.937 --> 13:36.649
Pop open! Pop open! Pop open!

13:37.107 --> 13:39.902
Ah!

13:39.985 --> 13:42.071
Surely Goat couldn't blame me
for that.

13:42.154 --> 13:47.201
And now if my eyes just happen
to glance across the page...

13:47.284 --> 13:51.705
<i>- "I can't decide which member</i>
<i>of Squishy Dreams I like best,</i>

13:51.789 --> 13:54.250
<i>"Brad with his rocking bod,</i>
<i>Brady with is dreamy eyes,</i>

13:54.333 --> 13:56.335
"Brando with his long,
luscious locks,

13:56.418 --> 13:59.588
or the way Bruce loves
his parents and collects rocks."

13:59.672 --> 14:02.383
- I guess I could pick up
Squishy Dreams new CD

14:02.466 --> 14:04.093
and give it to Goat.

14:04.176 --> 14:08.264
Or I could stuff the entire band
into a glass tube in my lab

14:08.347 --> 14:11.934
and fuse their DNA with mine
turning me into a combination

14:12.017 --> 14:13.936
of everything Goat loves.

14:14.019 --> 14:15.104
Hmm.

14:15.187 --> 14:19.733
all: Aaaaahh!

14:19.817 --> 14:21.443
- Great concert tonight, dudes.

14:21.527 --> 14:25.281
- I miss my parents
and rock collection.

14:25.364 --> 14:28.284
{\an1}- Hey, guys.
I'm a big fan of Mushy Dreams.

14:28.367 --> 14:30.744
- You mean Squishy Dreams.

14:30.828 --> 14:32.037
- Whatever.

14:32.121 --> 14:33.622
How would you like
to merge with me,

14:33.706 --> 14:36.250
{\an1}so we become one organically
fused super-hunk?

14:36.333 --> 14:39.044
- Eh, anything for a fan, man.

14:39.128 --> 14:41.922
- [babbling indistinctly]

14:52.891 --> 14:54.018
- It worked!

14:54.101 --> 14:55.769
Ooh, I'm gorgeous.

14:55.853 --> 14:58.522
I can't wait to show Goat
my new look.

14:58.606 --> 15:00.107
- Na, na, na, na.

15:00.190 --> 15:03.485
- Burgerstein, what's that
strange look in your eye?

15:03.569 --> 15:06.530
- Ya, haa, yaaa.

15:06.614 --> 15:08.991
- Aah, help! Help!

15:09.074 --> 15:10.909
{\an3}Oh, get away from me, oh!
Oh, ho, ho.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.328
Hey, officer, help.

15:12.411 --> 15:14.622
{\an1}My burger-headed servant
is in love with me.

15:14.705 --> 15:17.958
{\an3}- Ahhh.

15:21.837 --> 15:24.840
- Whew.

15:24.923 --> 15:26.133
all: Ahh!

15:26.216 --> 15:28.886
- Look at his hot cricket bod!

15:28.969 --> 15:31.847
- Yikes!

15:31.930 --> 15:33.349
[horn honks]

15:33.432 --> 15:35.601
- Hmm?

15:35.684 --> 15:38.687
{\an3}Help!

15:40.731 --> 15:42.483
{\an3}Ahh!

15:42.566 --> 15:44.943
{\an3}Ahh! Ahh!

15:45.027 --> 15:47.863
Where's Goat?

15:47.946 --> 15:49.531
{\an1}Yes.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.575
Whoa.

15:52.910 --> 15:56.205
Hey, Goat, there you is.

15:56.288 --> 15:57.706
- Look at you!

15:57.790 --> 15:59.833
You are hunkalicious.

15:59.917 --> 16:02.169
{\an1}- Yeah, I've just been
working out, eating right,

16:02.252 --> 16:05.297
slamming the Baboon-ium.

16:05.381 --> 16:08.967
{\an3}- Well, keep it up.
It's working.

16:09.051 --> 16:10.386
- Thanks.

16:10.469 --> 16:13.180
Say, if you're not doing
anything tonight?

16:13.263 --> 16:14.890
My experiment's
wearing off.

16:14.973 --> 16:16.558
Ooh!

16:16.642 --> 16:18.519
I was thinking we could...

16:18.602 --> 16:23.232
go to that new--
oh, ho, ho, ho ho--

16:23.315 --> 16:25.818
Pizza Palace?

16:25.901 --> 16:29.196
Eh...

16:29.279 --> 16:30.364
{\an3}Ahh!

16:30.447 --> 16:32.032
{\an3}Squishy Dreams
is coming out of you!

16:32.116 --> 16:33.742
[together]
Squishy Dreams.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.577
- Oh, I hate those guys.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.037
- But I thought you liked them.

16:37.121 --> 16:38.664
{\an1}I read in your diary...
woops.

16:38.747 --> 16:40.040
- Busted.

16:40.124 --> 16:41.667
- Oh, that wasn't my diary.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.585
That was my little sister's.

16:43.669 --> 16:45.170
So what happened to you?

16:45.254 --> 16:47.089
{\an1}- Oh, I just fused their DNA
with mine

16:47.172 --> 16:50.092
{\an1}accidentally turning myself
into a hydra-hunk.

16:50.175 --> 16:52.386
- That--that is so you.

16:52.469 --> 16:53.887
[laughter]

16:53.971 --> 16:55.097
- Oh, my word.

16:55.180 --> 16:59.226
- Oh, so hot.

16:59.309 --> 17:00.936
- What's wrong with Pig?

17:01.019 --> 17:02.980
{\an1}- Trust me.
Just start running.

17:03.063 --> 17:06.150
all: Ahh!

17:06.233 --> 17:07.443
Banana.

17:07.526 --> 17:10.028
{\an3}- Once there were three
Junior Rangers

17:10.112 --> 17:11.613
who got lost in the woods.

17:11.696 --> 17:13.490
And then they
found a chicken knuckle

17:13.574 --> 17:15.117
inside a jar of mayonnaise,

17:15.200 --> 17:18.119
{\an3}and on that chicken knuckle
was written a Sumarian curse.

17:18.203 --> 17:21.498
And they read it aloud on Friday
the 13th during an eclipse

17:21.582 --> 17:24.917
on top of a pyramid of Draculas,
and then chicken knuckle

17:25.002 --> 17:26.627
absorbed the power
of the mayonnaise

17:26.712 --> 17:31.133
and grew to become
the Gunk Knuckler.

17:31.216 --> 17:34.136
Later, they found one
of the Junior Rangers alive,

17:34.219 --> 17:36.930
but he'd gone crazy,
and all he could say was,

17:37.014 --> 17:39.057
"Gunk Knuckler."

17:39.141 --> 17:40.809
- Wait, that's it?

17:40.893 --> 17:45.147
- Another classic tale of terror
from the Scare Master General.

17:45.230 --> 17:46.982
Try sleeping tonight.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.484
- I'm sleeping now.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.152
{\an3}- That wouldn't scare
the scarediest scaredy-cat

17:50.235 --> 17:51.653
on Scaredy Lane.

17:51.737 --> 17:54.323
{\an3}- What? Everyone's scared
of the Gunk Knuckler.

17:54.406 --> 17:55.699
- Ha! Not us.

17:55.783 --> 17:57.117
- 'Cause you never saw him
before.

17:57.201 --> 18:00.454
You have no idea
what real scary is.

18:00.537 --> 18:01.705
both: Boo!

18:01.789 --> 18:03.123
[farts]

18:03.207 --> 18:06.001
[laughter]

18:06.085 --> 18:07.586
- He pooped his peel.

18:07.669 --> 18:10.005
{\an3}- Argh.

18:11.215 --> 18:13.801
- Ah, kids.
I'll show them.

18:13.884 --> 18:15.636
I know what to do
to get those kids.

18:15.719 --> 18:17.513
Wait till they see this.

18:22.684 --> 18:24.102
Scary.

18:24.186 --> 18:26.355
Oh-oh...

18:29.358 --> 18:31.276
The Gunk Knuckler.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.528
I don't know.

18:32.611 --> 18:34.404
Maybe scaring them
is a bad idea.

18:39.910 --> 18:42.329
Is the Gunk Knuckler there?

18:42.412 --> 18:45.958
{\an3}- Roarrr.
Roarrr.

18:46.041 --> 18:48.252
{\an3}Come on in.
Hot cocoa?

18:48.335 --> 18:49.878
- You're the Gunk Knuckler?

18:49.962 --> 18:52.673
You're supposed
to be horrifyingly scary.

18:52.756 --> 18:55.050
- After I ripped the brains
out of everyone around here,

18:55.134 --> 18:57.094
I kind of chilled out.

18:57.177 --> 18:58.637
{\an1}- Hey, look, man,
you got to help me.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.848
{\an1}I'm supposed
to be the Scare Master General,

19:00.931 --> 19:02.808
and unless I scare
some smart-aleck punks so bad

19:02.891 --> 19:05.352
they poop their pants,
I'm ruined.

19:05.435 --> 19:06.895
- Sorry, can't help you.

19:06.979 --> 19:09.231
I'm out of the scaring business.

19:09.314 --> 19:10.524
[timer dings]

19:10.607 --> 19:13.485
{\an3}Cookies.

19:13.569 --> 19:14.653
- Oh, this stinks.

19:14.736 --> 19:18.574
I need a horrifying monster,

19:18.657 --> 19:21.326
and you're just a horrifying
wimp.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.203
- You know,
calling someone a wimp

19:23.287 --> 19:26.790
can really undo
the whole chill-out feeling

19:26.874 --> 19:28.709
I got going here.

19:28.792 --> 19:30.711
- Hmm, wimp.

19:30.794 --> 19:35.257
{\an3}- Now, now,
I said don't call me that.

19:35.340 --> 19:36.717
- Sorry, wimp.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.761
- Don't call me a wimp.

19:39.845 --> 19:42.890
- Wimp.
- I said don't call me that.

19:42.973 --> 19:44.808
- Wimp, wimp,

19:44.892 --> 19:47.019
{\an3}wimpy wimp,
wimpy wimp.

19:47.102 --> 19:50.272
- Roaaar.
I'm gonna destroy you!

19:50.355 --> 19:52.024
- Oh, you couldn't scare
the cottage cheese

19:52.107 --> 19:55.527
out of those Junior Goofballs,
right, Wimp Knuckler?

19:55.611 --> 20:00.282
- Roaaar!
- This way.

20:00.365 --> 20:02.618
{\an3}Oh, ho, ho, get ready to poop
your pants, Gregs.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.328
- Ha, ha, ha.
Like you did?

20:04.411 --> 20:05.662
- Look over there.

20:05.746 --> 20:07.915
- Roarrr!

20:07.998 --> 20:09.249
[together]
Aaaah.

20:09.333 --> 20:10.709
[farting]

20:10.792 --> 20:12.502
{\an1}- Victory!
[laughs]

20:12.586 --> 20:14.212
I made you poop your pants.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.632
I am the Scare Master General.

20:16.715 --> 20:19.176
{\an1}Thanks, Gunk buddy.
Mission accomplished.

20:19.259 --> 20:20.802
{\an1}You can to back
to baking cookies now.

20:20.886 --> 20:23.388
{\an3}- Oh, no.
I'm not done with you.

20:23.472 --> 20:27.184
{\an1}- Ahh!

20:31.563 --> 20:32.940
- Looking good.

20:33.023 --> 20:35.150
{\an3}- Roaaar!

20:35.233 --> 20:37.319
{\an1}- Ahh!

20:37.402 --> 20:38.904
{\an3}- Roaaar!

20:38.987 --> 20:40.322
- I'll save you.

20:40.405 --> 20:42.824
