00:00.997 --> 00:02.715
Previously, on Lucifer...

00:02.915 --> 00:04.894
Someone is forcing
those wings on me.

00:05.102 --> 00:06.546
I'm sure it's all a part
of God's plan.

00:06.752 --> 00:08.049
If you mean His plan
to continually

00:08.248 --> 00:10.079
manipulate and control
me, then agreed.

00:10.281 --> 00:12.727
I really appreciate how
you handled the whole

00:12.928 --> 00:15.101
"me not wanting you and
Amenadiel to bone" thing.

00:15.306 --> 00:17.638
I do really like you.

00:18.874 --> 00:20.978
You can't die, I know.
But I promise you,

00:21.214 --> 00:22.306
I will find a way to end

00:22.518 --> 00:23.507
your infinite misery

00:23.707 --> 00:25.277
if it's the last thing I do.

00:25.817 --> 00:27.455
Thank you for your help, Maze.

00:27.697 --> 00:29.801
No worries.
This actually gives me time

00:29.999 --> 00:32.172
to brainstorm a little problem
of my own.

00:32.914 --> 00:33.551
Aah!

00:33.988 --> 00:35.580
LUCIFER: I don't understand.
How does this not work?

00:35.791 --> 00:37.088
You still have no idea
how to kill me.

00:38.055 --> 00:38.771
(elevator bell dings)

00:41.047 --> 00:42.617
Lucifer, I'm here.

00:44.883 --> 00:45.941
Are you ready?

00:47.799 --> 00:48.788
Lucifer?

00:52.248 --> 00:54.079
(laughs):
Why is it so dark in here?

00:55.471 --> 00:56.267
Wha...?

00:59.307 --> 01:00.023
Lucifer?

01:02.107 --> 01:04.473
Lucifer?
(sighs)

01:05.253 --> 01:05.810
LUCIFER:
Detective.

01:06.059 --> 01:07.083
(gaspS)

01:07.977 --> 01:09.649
There's been a change of plan.
I'm not going.

01:10.087 --> 01:11.805
What? But we have a case.

01:12.005 --> 01:14.644
Something's happened.
Please leave.

01:14.843 --> 01:16.788
Wait, what's happened?
Are you okay?

01:17.644 --> 01:18.247
LUCIFER:
I can't...

01:19.409 --> 01:21.001
I can't make them go away.

01:21.710 --> 01:22.972
Wha...?

01:23.705 --> 01:24.615
Lucifer,

01:25.355 --> 01:27.220
-what's on your back?
-Detective,

01:27.426 --> 01:29.326
I said leave!

01:29.574 --> 01:31.599
(gasping)
What's going on?

01:32.106 --> 01:33.368
I can't...

01:34.408 --> 01:36.239
I can't control them.

01:37.362 --> 01:38.852
(screams)

01:39.548 --> 01:40.719
No! Detective!

01:41.965 --> 01:43.136
(gasping)

01:44.766 --> 01:45.824
Detective!

01:46.722 --> 01:48.519
Detective, grab my hand!

01:50.098 --> 01:50.780
Detective!

01:51.018 --> 01:51.962
(Chloe screams)

01:52.361 --> 01:53.305
No!

01:54.087 --> 01:55.304
No...

01:55.852 --> 01:56.944
No!

01:58.537 --> 01:59.902
And then I woke up.

02:00.724 --> 02:02.624
And it's not the sort
of dream I'm used to.

02:02.834 --> 02:04.131
A lot less nudity.

02:04.752 --> 02:05.514
So what do you think
it means?

02:05.711 --> 02:06.655
Well, I think it's
pretty obvious

02:06.862 --> 02:07.954
what it means, Lucifer.

02:08.358 --> 02:10.690
That I need sturdier
guardrails?

02:10.890 --> 02:13.017
Or, maybe there's some
symbolism in there.

02:13.230 --> 02:14.674
-You mean my wings, don't you?
-Yes.

02:14.879 --> 02:17.131
-Wel|, clearly, you have issues.
-Well, you would, too,

02:17.373 --> 02:19.739
if your father slapped
a pair on your back.

02:20.327 --> 02:22.966
Took away your Devil face,
took away who you are.

02:24.470 --> 02:26.222
I mean, who knows what else
He'll take from me.

02:26.925 --> 02:29.598
Lux? My...
job with the LAPD?

02:30.032 --> 02:31.056
Or Chloe.

02:33.446 --> 02:36.586
Well, she may be part of it,
but this isn't about her.

02:36.784 --> 02:37.955
This is about me.

02:38.433 --> 02:40.833
So can we please just focus
on what truly matters here?

02:41.311 --> 02:42.983
-Which is?
-Showing my Father

02:43.190 --> 02:44.760
that He can't control me.

02:44.955 --> 02:46.627
And He's not as powerful
as he thinks.

02:46.835 --> 02:48.245
And how are you going
to do that?

02:48.446 --> 02:49.583
By defying Him.

02:50.210 --> 02:52.155
I'm gonna remove
Pierce's immortal curse

02:52.359 --> 02:53.451
so he can finally die.

02:55.121 --> 02:57.908
There's just
one problem, though.

02:58.458 --> 02:59.015
Just one?

02:59.302 --> 03:01.167
(sighs) Everything
that I've come up with,

03:01.412 --> 03:02.777
Pierce has already tried.

03:03.560 --> 03:05.004
I'm completely out of ideas.

03:05.210 --> 03:08.384
My well is dry,
and that is why I'm here.

03:08.777 --> 03:09.459
Yeah, well.

03:09.890 --> 03:12.415
Not sure I know how to remove
an immortal's curse.

03:12.652 --> 03:13.641
Uaughsr
No.

03:13.841 --> 03:16.321
I need you to remove
my mental block.

03:16.680 --> 03:18.318
Hypnotize me, or something.

03:18.790 --> 03:20.690
I hear it works with smoking
and insomnia, so...

03:21.629 --> 03:22.232
(grunts)

03:22.434 --> 03:24.561
Unfortunately, that's not
how it works, Lucifer.

03:24.966 --> 03:27.446
There's no easy fix
for a lack of ideas.

03:28.879 --> 03:30.050
:a—éé‘;<:
it???”
,5

03:30.490 --> 03:31.787
You just have
to be patient.

03:32.140 --> 03:35.428
You never know when or where
inspiration will strike.

03:35.707 --> 03:37.345
Well, thank you,
Doctor.

03:42.958 --> 03:43.720
(scoffs)

03:44.224 --> 03:45.054
(sighs)

03:45.298 --> 03:47.471
(phone rings)

03:51.742 --> 03:52.538
Ah.

03:54.389 --> 03:55.560
Hi, Amenadiel.

03:55.770 --> 03:57.795
J‘J‘ J‘J‘

03:58.839 --> 03:59.783
J‘J‘ Ooh, ooh J‘J‘

04:01.179 --> 04:01.941
J‘J‘ Ooh. J‘J‘

04:02.752 --> 04:03.514
Hey,EHa?

04:04.287 --> 04:04.924
Um...
(clears throat)

04:05.131 --> 04:07.110
Uh, listen, about tonight?

04:07.317 --> 04:09.182
-I'm gonna have to...
-No!

04:10.309 --> 04:11.025
No.

04:11.230 --> 04:12.868
You better not
be cancelling on me again.

04:13.071 --> 04:14.789
I know,
I'm so sorry.

04:14.990 --> 04:16.969
It's just,
I have so much work to do.

04:17.215 --> 04:17.852
Can't you play hooky?

04:18.404 --> 04:20.531
Not if I want to be
a responsible adult.

04:20.744 --> 04:21.768
Right.

04:21.971 --> 04:23.188
But...

04:23.506 --> 04:24.768
What if...

04:25.232 --> 04:27.837
you weren't a responsible adult?

04:29.375 --> 04:31.935
(laughing):
Just this once.

04:32.406 --> 04:33.577
Come on!

04:34.170 --> 04:35.159
Chloe,

04:35.360 --> 04:37.646
I mean, don't you ever miss
just having stupid fun

04:37.891 --> 04:38.687
like when you were a kid?

04:39.157 --> 04:41.216
I was a pretty grown-up kid,
actually.

04:42.495 --> 04:44.622
Well, never too late to start.

04:45.794 --> 04:48.240
I know.
I'm sorry, babe, I can't.

04:49.208 --> 04:51.153
Can we do a neon party
rain check?

04:53.044 --> 04:55.604
Decker, one of these days,

04:56.036 --> 04:57.560
you're gonna realize
what you've been missing.

04:58.338 --> 04:59.635
(quietly): It looked
so cute on you.

04:59.834 --> 05:00.971
(scoffs)

05:03.862 --> 05:05.659
(indistinct radio chatter)

05:13.990 --> 05:16.550
This is the longest you've
ever gone without talking.

05:16.867 --> 05:19.267
Ever. Is something
on your mind?

05:19.706 --> 05:20.422
Nothing.

05:20.856 --> 05:21.914
That's the problem.
(sighs)

05:22.122 --> 05:23.066
Uh, how so?

05:23.465 --> 05:25.137
(sighs) Well, I...

05:25.345 --> 05:28.212
I have this puzzle
that I need to solve,

05:28.452 --> 05:29.589
but I've hit a mental block.

05:29.833 --> 05:30.970
-Okay.
-Have you ever just

05:31.214 --> 05:34.149
ran out of ideas when working
a particularly difficult case?

05:34.360 --> 05:35.952
I mean, before I came along,
of course.

05:36.163 --> 05:37.380
(scoffs) Right.

05:37.927 --> 05:40.566
Um... not really.

05:40.766 --> 05:43.746
l-I mean, I've hit dead ends
from lack of evidence,

05:43.950 --> 05:46.783
but no, because there's always
a new angle to consider.

05:48.362 --> 05:49.044
Braggart.

05:50.126 --> 05:51.115
(sighs)

05:53.502 --> 05:56.255
DAN: Our victim's name was
Kathleen Pike, 33.

05:56.494 --> 05:57.586
She's the author
of a best-selling

05:57.799 --> 06:01.667
futuristic Y.A. series
called Class of 3001.

06:01.865 --> 06:03.127
She was found
with her head bashed in

06:03.323 --> 06:04.893
by her own
vintage typewriter.

06:05.087 --> 06:06.076
The irony's a little
on the nose.

06:06.277 --> 06:07.539
Or on the head, should I say?

06:08.003 --> 06:09.027
CHLOE:
What's that white stuff?

06:09.537 --> 06:10.708
ELLA: I know what you
guys are thinking.

06:10.918 --> 06:12.362
She's a synthetic.

06:13.834 --> 06:14.630
Aliens.

06:14.831 --> 06:16.958
The android who bled white.
(gurgles)

06:18.974 --> 06:21.841
No one? Really?
Oh, never mind.

06:22.043 --> 06:23.533
That's melted ice cream, anyway.

06:23.731 --> 06:25.631
It looks like our victim was
about to dig in last night

06:25.841 --> 06:27.900
when someone showed up
and rewrote her dessert menu

06:28.104 --> 06:29.366
with that typewriter.

06:29.831 --> 06:31.731
Real wound's
over here though.

06:33.130 --> 06:35.189
-Huh. Who found the body?
-(camera clicks)

06:35.393 --> 06:36.451
Kathleen's editor.
Vincent Green.

06:36.697 --> 06:37.607
He's out by the pool.

06:38.040 --> 06:38.836
Thank you.

06:40.457 --> 06:41.515
Uh, Daniel.

06:42.452 --> 06:44.170
-Your head is mostly empty.
-Huh?

06:44.561 --> 06:47.041
Exactly. And yet, you manage
to do this improv thing.

06:47.247 --> 06:48.737
How do you come up with stuff
on the spot like that?

06:50.009 --> 06:51.761
Well, the first rule of improv
is "yes, and..."

06:51.965 --> 06:53.557
Yes and what?

06:54.651 --> 06:55.788
That's the name
of the technique.

06:55.993 --> 06:57.255
Right. I've heard you talk
about it before,

06:57.451 --> 06:58.713
but I don't actually understand
what it means.

06:59.024 --> 07:02.471
Well, you agree with whatever's
being said-- yes.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.955
And then you say the first thing
that comes to your mind-- and.

07:05.200 --> 07:06.770
That makes no sense.

07:07.463 --> 07:09.328
(sighs) But I'm desperate,
so I'll try anything.

07:09.842 --> 07:10.934
Yes, and.

07:11.146 --> 07:12.898
VINCENT: [got the call
from Kathleen late last night.

07:13.256 --> 07:14.348
She finally finished
the new book.

07:14.790 --> 07:16.234
We made plans for me
to come over this morning,

07:16.440 --> 07:17.384
pick up the manuscript.

07:17.591 --> 07:19.388
Do you usually pick up
manuscripts in person?

07:19.662 --> 07:20.754
With Kathleen, yes.

07:20.967 --> 07:22.138
There's only ever
one hard copy

07:22.348 --> 07:24.179
since she does all her writing
on that typewriter.

07:24.419 --> 07:25.909
Yes, and... well, her dying

07:26.107 --> 07:27.472
on that typewriter as well,
it seems.

07:27.680 --> 07:29.204
CHLOE: Do you know anyone who
would have done this to her?

07:29.406 --> 07:32.193
-Any known enemies?
-No, Kathleen was
extremely well-liked.

07:32.398 --> 07:34.298
She had millions
of devoted fans.

07:34.508 --> 07:36.794
Ugh, I know how fans can get
obsessed with their idols.

07:37.002 --> 07:38.720
Yes, and... with their boobs.

07:38.920 --> 07:40.444
Like after you did Hot Tub High School, Detective.

07:40.646 --> 07:43.251
-Oh. Uh-huh.
-You don't think this could
be my fault, do you?

07:43.446 --> 07:45.653
-Why?
-l was so excited
that she was finished

07:45.863 --> 07:47.228
that I tweeted the news
to her fans.

07:47.436 --> 07:49.301
I really talked the book up,
hinting at this huge

07:49.508 --> 07:51.908
action-packed robot rebellion
ending she teased me with.

07:52.116 --> 07:53.981
Well, as long as you didn't
tweet her address as well.

07:54.188 --> 07:55.758
No, of course not,
but someone could find that.

07:55.952 --> 07:57.362
Someone who wanted to
read the book first?

07:57.564 --> 07:59.361
Yes, and... someone who wanted
to tell her

07:59.558 --> 08:01.924
that robot rebellions couldn't
be more dull and derivative.

08:02.129 --> 08:03.573
What is with all this
"yes, and" stuff?

08:03.816 --> 08:05.181
Oh, just some improv thing
I was hoping

08:05.389 --> 08:07.027
would knock me out
of my idea dry spell.

08:07.231 --> 08:09.290
But you're literally just saying
what you would normally say,

08:09.839 --> 08:11.283
with the words "yes, and"
in front of it.

08:11.489 --> 08:13.662
Yes, and...
it's clearly not working.

08:13.867 --> 08:15.232
-Uh-uh.
-Stupid Daniel.

08:15.440 --> 08:16.611
Idea dry spell.

08:16.821 --> 08:17.617
Just like Kathleen.

08:17.857 --> 08:18.721
What do you mean?

08:18.931 --> 08:21.331
She had the worst case of
writer's block I've ever seen.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.945
Took her five years to figure
out how to end the series.

08:24.378 --> 08:26.323
Well, never mind that.
How did she cure her block?

08:26.757 --> 08:29.043
I don't know, she said I would
understand after I read it.

08:29.250 --> 08:31.047
Said she even explained
how she broke through it

08:31.245 --> 08:32.337
in the book's afterword.

08:32.549 --> 08:33.573
But you haven't read it.

08:33.815 --> 08:34.804
No, like I said,
there's only one copy

08:35.004 --> 08:35.914
and I haven't seen it.

08:36.117 --> 08:37.027
Detective.

08:37.651 --> 08:38.868
This afterword
could explain how

08:39.071 --> 08:40.663
to overcome my own form
of writer's block.

08:41.257 --> 08:43.088
-What?
-We need to find it.

08:43.291 --> 08:45.350
The killer. You mean we need
to find the killer.

08:45.554 --> 08:47.272
Exactly. So they can
hand over that book.

08:48.891 --> 08:50.643
J‘J‘ J‘J‘

08:59.364 --> 09:01.468
J‘J‘ Never get to bed... J‘J‘

09:01.666 --> 09:04.146
Mmm. Linda, I have to say,

09:04.351 --> 09:07.798
these last few weeks have been
absolutely incredible.

09:08.111 --> 09:08.975
Wow.

09:09.798 --> 09:12.005
You're really good at this
sweet, sappy stuff, aren't you?

09:12.254 --> 09:13.824
-(chuckles)
-(giggles)

09:15.783 --> 09:17.000
I feel the same.

09:17.202 --> 09:18.146
Good.

09:19.389 --> 09:21.516
Well, maybe someday

09:21.729 --> 09:23.299
we can actually have
this date in public?

09:23.532 --> 09:26.740
(both laugh)

09:27.598 --> 09:31.807
(sighs) I do hate
sneaking around, but Maze.

09:32.202 --> 09:34.488
I know. I know.
She can't find out.

09:37.150 --> 09:39.050
I want to tell her,
I just don't know how.

09:39.720 --> 09:42.507
I admit, I'm afraid.

09:42.713 --> 09:44.305
Well, you should be.
Maze would...

09:44.592 --> 09:45.854
not take this well.

09:47.201 --> 09:48.998
I feel so guilty, I.... (scoffs)

09:49.388 --> 09:50.912
I've been avoiding
her calls.

09:51.114 --> 09:52.103
Are we being cowards?

09:52.303 --> 09:53.474
Yes.

09:54.068 --> 09:54.978
But, Linda, it's...

09:55.219 --> 09:56.971
-Maze.
-Maze. I know.

09:57.213 --> 09:58.271
Do you know how she's doing?

09:58.786 --> 10:00.196
I'm sure she's fine.

10:00.397 --> 10:03.070
Busy hunting bounties and all.

10:05.576 --> 10:06.668
But...

10:07.724 --> 10:10.431
I can check on her if that'll
make you feel better.

10:10.640 --> 10:13.006
Really? Just to make sure
she's okay.

10:13.287 --> 10:14.083
Of course.

10:15.435 --> 10:16.925
I would do anything for you.

10:17.123 --> 10:19.068
J‘J‘ Over my head... J‘J‘

10:19.271 --> 10:20.989
What? Is that too sappy?

10:21.688 --> 10:24.134
N” No, I don't like my fate J‘J‘

10:24.373 --> 10:27.206
J‘J‘ Or how I'm turning out J‘J‘

10:28.210 --> 10:29.620
J‘J‘ Yeah J‘J‘

10:30.128 --> 10:31.618
I: How I'm turning out. J‘J‘

10:31.854 --> 10:33.651
"Max was plagued with confusion.

10:33.849 --> 10:36.784
"If Jessica truly loved him,
then why'd she kiss Tristan?

10:37.531 --> 10:40.318
"And in the back seat
of her flying car, no less."

10:41.214 --> 10:43.387
This has sold
millions of copies.

10:43.593 --> 10:46.232
Tongueless kissing and stealing
liquor from their parents.

10:46.431 --> 10:49.138
(chuckles) I mean,
where's the sex? The drugs?

10:49.654 --> 10:51.827
That robot rebellion
cannot come soon enough.

10:52.416 --> 10:55.055
Was your high school experience
this pathetically PG?

10:55.638 --> 10:57.663
I didn't have much of
a high school experience.

10:58.208 --> 10:59.926
Oh! Played hooky
a lot did you?

11:00.126 --> 11:00.922
Suddenly I like you more.

11:01.124 --> 11:03.410
No, child actors don't have
much time for regular school.

11:03.656 --> 11:05.294
You're either
auditioning or on set,

11:05.535 --> 11:07.981
-so it's mostly tutors.
-Ah.

11:08.566 --> 11:10.158
Maybe I did
miss out on a lot.

11:11.098 --> 11:12.190
Anyhow, why are you
reading those?

11:12.402 --> 11:13.198
I doubt that that's gonna

11:13.400 --> 11:14.230
lead us to
Kathleen's killer.

11:14.435 --> 11:15.959
Oh, well, Kathleen's
afterword explained

11:16.162 --> 11:17.299
how she overcame
her writer's block.

11:17.504 --> 11:19.483
In order to understand,
I may need context.

11:19.691 --> 11:21.135
Oh, in case she uses examples?

11:21.494 --> 11:23.894
Exactly.
So, speaking of the killer,

11:24.102 --> 11:24.966
anyleads?

11:25.637 --> 11:26.661
Yeah, actually.

11:27.248 --> 11:28.772
Someone who goes by
the name of

11:29.013 --> 11:31.345
"Ashley3001fan."

11:31.545 --> 11:34.685
Got into some pretty heated
online arguments with Kathleen.

11:34.882 --> 11:36.019
Apparently,
she wasn't too happy

11:36.225 --> 11:37.863
the book was taking
so long to be completed.

11:38.373 --> 11:40.398
Poor Kathleen. When will people
understand writer's block

11:40.598 --> 11:41.622
is a very serious condition?

11:41.825 --> 11:42.996
Well, Kathleen agreed.

11:43.206 --> 11:44.150
LUCIFER: "I don't
have to answer

11:44.357 --> 11:45.346
"to ignorant trolls
like you.

11:45.547 --> 11:46.411
"There's a reason
I'm the writer

11:46.659 --> 11:47.683
"and you're a fan.

11:47.887 --> 11:48.683
"Maybe you should try
contributing

11:48.884 --> 11:50.181
something to society."

11:50.418 --> 11:51.589
Ouch, nicely put, Kathleen.

11:51.799 --> 11:53.972
Yeah. After Kathleen
publicly berated her,

11:54.216 --> 11:55.387
Ashley went completely offline.

11:55.597 --> 11:57.963
You think Ashley
was so humiliated by her hero

11:58.168 --> 11:59.032
that she wanted revenge?

11:59.664 --> 12:00.801
(sighs)
It's possible.

12:01.121 --> 12:03.407
Well, let's hope so 'cause
I need to find that boo...

12:04.382 --> 12:05.644
Killer, the b-- killer.

12:06.991 --> 12:07.901
I know you mean book.

12:09.139 --> 12:09.776
Idid.

12:10.482 --> 12:11.574
(knocking on door)

12:14.203 --> 12:15.113
Hi, Amenadiel.

12:15.545 --> 12:18.105
Hey, Trixie.
Uh, is Maze here?

12:18.653 --> 12:20.177
Sorry, no.

12:20.609 --> 12:21.371
Oh.

12:25.750 --> 12:27.695
Would you mind telling her
that I stopped by, please?

12:28.435 --> 12:29.117
Sure.

12:29.969 --> 12:30.993
Thanks.

12:36.759 --> 12:38.203
Nice work, Trix.

12:40.097 --> 12:41.587
Why don't you
want to see him?

12:41.785 --> 12:42.774
Amenadiel's nice.

12:43.357 --> 12:44.119
Nice?

12:45.582 --> 12:46.913
If he were nice,

12:47.117 --> 12:49.722
he wouldn't be sneaking around
behind my back with my friend,

12:49.917 --> 12:51.134
and lying about it.

12:52.449 --> 12:53.438
Why are they
doing that?

12:53.638 --> 12:55.390
I don't know.
'Cause they suck.

12:55.748 --> 12:57.272
Mommy says that sometimes,

12:57.475 --> 12:59.420
people are just scared
to tell the truth.

13:00.428 --> 13:01.759
Maybe they need a little help.

13:02.577 --> 13:04.147
That's not a bad idea, kid.

13:06.490 --> 13:09.197
Helping people tell the truth
is kind of my thing.

13:11.400 --> 13:12.230
Huh.

13:15.466 --> 13:17.946
I cybertraced
Ashley3001fan to here.

13:18.151 --> 13:19.516
And the ice cream
from the crime scene,

13:21.029 --> 13:22.894
-Ashley could be
one of these three.
-Yes.

13:23.138 --> 13:25.163
They do seem like
the insipid Y.A. type.

13:25.363 --> 13:27.695
Though, scooping frozen treats
for others day in, day out,

13:27.934 --> 13:29.105
seems even more boring.

13:29.391 --> 13:30.722
CHLOE: Yeah, but they get to
hang out with their friends.

13:30.926 --> 13:32.257
There's no
adult responsibility.

13:32.499 --> 13:33.591
It looks like
they're having fun.

13:33.918 --> 13:35.408
You know, stupid fun.

13:35.606 --> 13:37.324
Since when do you
like "stupid fun"?

13:39.557 --> 13:40.194
Hi.

13:40.401 --> 13:43.336
Detective Decker, LAPD.
I'd like to ask you all some...

13:45.733 --> 13:46.904
-Freeze.
-LUCIFER: Ha.

13:47.114 --> 13:48.331
"Freeze,"
good one.

13:48.572 --> 13:50.745
(panting) Please.

13:50.951 --> 13:51.975
Please don't call my mom.

13:52.332 --> 13:53.776
l-It's just one joint.

13:54.211 --> 13:56.042
Claire?
What's going on?

13:56.782 --> 13:57.544
Claire?

13:58.163 --> 13:59.221
You're not Ashley?

14:00.119 --> 14:01.290
No, I'm Ashley.

14:01.845 --> 14:03.016
Ashley's a man?

14:03.610 --> 14:04.668
Yeah, I'm a man.

14:05.375 --> 14:06.865
And I'm the manager.
What's going on?

14:07.062 --> 14:08.472
Oh, what's
going on, Ashley,

14:08.674 --> 14:10.039
is you need to
give me that book.

14:10.247 --> 14:11.578
Otherwise, I'll show you
the true meaning of

14:11.781 --> 14:13.146
"you scream for ice cream."

14:14.198 --> 14:15.062
Okay?

14:15.579 --> 14:16.568
All right.

14:24.786 --> 14:26.583
LUCIFER: I'm gonna
ask you nicely, Ashley.

14:26.819 --> 14:27.843
Where '5 the book?

14:28.238 --> 14:31.105
Dude, I'm telling you.
I don't have any book.

14:34.606 --> 14:36.506
Then why was that found
at Kathleen Pike's home?

14:38.442 --> 14:39.852
"3000 and Yum."

14:40.245 --> 14:43.180
Yeah, that's a flavor I created
special for Kathleen.

14:43.391 --> 14:44.835
I brought it to her house
personally.

14:45.040 --> 14:46.985
Do you always bring ice cream
to your murder victims?

14:47.611 --> 14:48.521
Murder?

14:50.373 --> 14:51.203
Wait...

14:52.061 --> 14:53.278
Kathleen's dead?

14:53.480 --> 14:54.276
Ve ry.

14:54.439 --> 14:57.044
Man, she was the greatest
writer of our generation.

14:57.239 --> 14:57.921
What?

14:58.237 --> 14:59.681
Her books were about
high school drama.

14:59.886 --> 15:02.593
What could a man of your age
possibly find great about them?

15:03.070 --> 15:05.129
(chuckles): I mean, high school
was the best time of my life.

15:05.641 --> 15:09.111
Reading 3001 makes me
feel like I'm 16 again.

15:09.592 --> 15:11.389
Those books are deeper
than you think.

15:12.431 --> 15:14.717
We know about your online fight
with Kathleen.

15:14.963 --> 15:16.180
Things got very heated.

15:16.382 --> 15:17.952
Must've hurt to have her
insult you like that

15:18.147 --> 15:19.205
in front of everybody.

15:19.451 --> 15:20.622
I never should've
said those things.

15:20.832 --> 15:22.094
So, I sent her
some of my writing.

15:22.290 --> 15:23.552
You know, like an olive branch.

15:23.747 --> 15:25.044
Hold on, you're a writer?

15:25.243 --> 15:26.335
Yeah, man.
I've written, like,

15:26.509 --> 15:28.841
tons of Class of 3001
fan fiction.

15:29.962 --> 15:31.862
Can't imagine that Kathleen
was too pleased.

15:32.187 --> 15:33.825
Kathleen liked my writing.

15:34.182 --> 15:36.241
She even asked me to help her
finish her last book.

15:36.445 --> 15:38.117
She asked you to help?

15:38.325 --> 15:41.305
So Kathleen's solution to
writer's block was to outsource?

15:41.509 --> 15:43.079
Yeah, but when Kathleen
read my version,

15:43.273 --> 15:45.525
she decided she wanted to go
in a different direction.

15:46.074 --> 15:48.941
But she said it did help her
f-finish her book on her own.

15:49.143 --> 15:50.440
So... (scoffs) boom.

15:50.639 --> 15:52.129
It did? How?

15:52.787 --> 15:55.187
What exactly helped Kathleen
overcome her block?

15:55.549 --> 16:00.031
She told me she realized
she needed to be more authentic.

16:00.229 --> 16:02.436
You know, get back
to her original inspiration.

16:03.145 --> 16:05.591
That is completely meaningless.

16:05.792 --> 16:09.159
Well, well, what was
the original inspiration?

16:09.743 --> 16:12.837
Oh? You guys don't know?

16:13.042 --> 16:15.169
So, the characters in Kathleen's
books are based on real people.

16:15.382 --> 16:16.747
DAN: And all of her
stories were taken

16:16.955 --> 16:18.013
from her real life
at Westside High,

16:18.221 --> 16:19.131
right here in LA.

16:19.870 --> 16:21.815
LUCIFER:
Max, Jessica, Isabel.

16:22.057 --> 16:23.809
She didn't even change
any of the first names.

16:24.052 --> 16:26.225
Did she have any
original ideas at all?

16:26.507 --> 16:27.531
Well, she changed
the last names.

16:27.773 --> 16:28.831
ELLA: And she did
have to come up

16:29.039 --> 16:30.210
with all that
futuristic sci-fi stuff.

16:30.458 --> 16:32.403
I mean, trust me,
that is not easy.

16:32.645 --> 16:33.634
I'm actually writing
my own book

16:33.834 --> 16:34.892
about a forensic
scientist

16:35.138 --> 16:36.662
-who talks to ghosts.
-You are? Tell me,

16:36.865 --> 16:38.275
what do you do when
you run out of ideas?

16:38.476 --> 16:40.455
Oh, I never run out of ideas.
I've got way too many.

16:40.662 --> 16:41.993
My problem is how to choose.

16:42.274 --> 16:43.218
Well, there's no need
to rub it in.

16:43.424 --> 16:45.016
-Thank you.
-So, this author exposed

16:45.227 --> 16:46.444
all these people's
dirty laundry?

16:46.647 --> 16:47.591
Sounds like motive to me.

16:49.754 --> 16:51.119
uh, Ms. Richards is right.

16:51.327 --> 16:53.306
If, uh, someone saw
the editor's tweet

16:53.513 --> 16:55.617
announcing another book, then
maybe one of them killed her

16:55.854 --> 16:57.025
to make sure it
didn't come out.

16:58.807 --> 16:59.489
Ella.

17:00.610 --> 17:02.896
The main characters
from the Class of 3001--

17:03.104 --> 17:05.629
if the book's gonna reveal
any secrets, it's theirs.

17:05.828 --> 17:07.090
These are our suspects.

17:07.285 --> 17:10.607
Right. Prom king,
sexpot, cheerleader,

17:10.853 --> 17:13.606
bad boy, valedictorian, jock.

17:13.807 --> 17:16.014
One of these six degenerates has
my book. Let's bring them in.

17:16.224 --> 17:18.897
No, all you have is speculation.
Not enough for arrest warrants.

17:19.254 --> 17:20.824
I mean, even if we did
bring them all in,

17:21.057 --> 17:22.194
we don't have any leverage.
Why would they

17:22.400 --> 17:23.264
admit to anything?

17:23.474 --> 17:24.839
CHLOE: Well, according
to superfan Ashley,

17:25.047 --> 17:26.412
Kathleen was rushing to get
her book done in time

17:26.658 --> 17:27.716
to announce it
at her high school reunion,

17:27.924 --> 17:28.834
which is tomorrow night.

17:29.190 --> 17:31.249
Well, if all our suspects
are in town to attend,

17:32.105 --> 17:32.935
gave them opportunity.

17:33.256 --> 17:35.383
Mm-hmm. And it gives us
an opportunity as well,

17:35.596 --> 17:36.312
to go undercover.

17:36.517 --> 17:38.109
-We|l, good. What are we
waiting for?
-Well,

17:38.320 --> 17:40.185
it's a high school reunion.
Everybody knows everybody.

17:40.391 --> 17:42.996
Unless...
you're Todd Cornwell.

17:43.575 --> 17:44.633
Who's Todd Cornwell?

17:44.918 --> 17:47.045
Exactly. Todd Cornwell.

17:47.296 --> 17:48.740
Class loner, acne,

17:48.946 --> 17:49.935
Coke-bottle glasses,
whole bit.

17:50.174 --> 17:51.471
Went to college overseas,

17:51.670 --> 17:53.843
and when I stalked Kathleen's
classmates online,

17:54.048 --> 17:56.687
Todd was the only one with
zero social media presence.

17:56.887 --> 17:59.139
Lucifer, you could go as Todd.

18:01.107 --> 18:03.052
Yeah, no, no, seriously.
Look, he looks just like you.

18:03.293 --> 18:04.783
LUCIFER: Has all that
masturbation finally caught up

18:04.981 --> 18:05.777
with your eyesight,
Daniel?

18:06.017 --> 18:07.348
No one'll believe that
even if I tell them

18:07.551 --> 18:09.189
I've had a face
and body transplant.

18:09.431 --> 18:10.762
CHLOE: Yeah, but it
might be our only shot.

18:10.966 --> 18:11.955
I mean, I could go
as your plus-one.

18:12.193 --> 18:13.285
ELLA:
Oh, poops. Hold up.

18:13.804 --> 18:15.374
Todd RSVP'd "yes."

18:16.873 --> 18:18.591
(sighs) Charlotte,
is there any legal way

18:18.791 --> 18:19.701
to prevent him from attending?

18:21.208 --> 18:23.768
Well, it's definitely
not legal

18:23.970 --> 18:25.949
to distract Todd with,
say, a bounty hunter.

18:26.157 --> 18:27.909
If anyone needs me,
I'm gonna be in my office

18:28.190 --> 18:29.134
not hearing the plan.

18:30.031 --> 18:31.623
Okay, great.
Are you gonna call Maze?

18:31.834 --> 18:34.701
Gladly, whilst you
research our suspects.

18:35.364 --> 18:36.126
Enjoy.

18:37.857 --> 18:38.846
Maze.

18:40.696 --> 18:41.788
I'm so glad you're here.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.480
Yeah, well,
you seem pretty busy.

18:44.916 --> 18:47.248
I called a couple of times.
Never heard back.

18:47.754 --> 18:50.507
Yeah, I know, work's been crazy.

18:50.785 --> 18:54.573
Oh. I was hoping that maybe
you found a boyfriend.

18:54.813 --> 18:55.677
-Boyfriend?
-Yeah.

18:55.887 --> 18:57.787
Why would I... (laughs)

18:59.186 --> 19:00.130
Definitely no boyfriend.

19:00.912 --> 19:01.742
-Really?
-Yup.

19:01.948 --> 19:05.122
So single. 80... so single.

19:05.324 --> 19:07.042
Well, in that case,
I should totally set you up.

19:07.702 --> 19:08.760
I have just the guy.

19:09.083 --> 19:11.187
Oh, that it so thoughtful
of you, Maze,

19:11.385 --> 19:13.285
but you really don't
have to do that.

19:13.533 --> 19:16.900
Please, Linda, I want to.
What are best friends for?

19:17.101 --> 19:18.898
I know, it's just me
and blind dates...

19:19.134 --> 19:20.305
-How about tomorrow night?
-Tomorrow night?

19:20.515 --> 19:21.231
Mm.

19:21.781 --> 19:24.796
Oh... shoot. I think I'm busy.

19:27.535 --> 19:28.524
Let me do this.

19:29.952 --> 19:30.941
Tomorrow it is.

19:41.192 --> 19:41.908
(gaspS)

19:43.072 --> 19:44.016
No.

19:45.565 --> 19:46.589
(sighs)

19:47.483 --> 19:48.620
-(exclaims)
-BEATRICE: Mom?

19:50.092 --> 19:51.844
Baby, what are you doing up?
Get back in bed.

19:52.048 --> 19:53.948
Bed? It's morning.

19:54.734 --> 19:55.951
I'm gonna miss the bus.

19:56.537 --> 19:57.754
What?
I've- I've, uh...

19:57.956 --> 19:59.253
I've been up all night?

19:59.797 --> 20:01.742
Come on, come on.
Get the...

20:02.444 --> 20:04.730
Get- get, go, get your...
Where's the...?

20:05.245 --> 20:08.840
J'J‘ Tell me, did you fall
from a shooting star? J‘J‘

20:09.426 --> 20:11.223
J‘J‘ One without a permanent scar J‘J‘

20:11.421 --> 20:12.831
J‘J‘ And did you miss me J‘J‘

20:13.032 --> 20:14.829
J‘J‘ While you were looking
for yourself out there? J‘J‘

20:15.027 --> 20:18.394
(gasps) Oh.

20:18.901 --> 20:19.845
Wow.

20:20.091 --> 20:22.764
You know, high school reunion's
a very popular torture in Hell.

20:23.006 --> 20:24.803
CHLOE:
This is beautiful.

20:25.308 --> 20:27.754
I... you know, you didn't
even try to look like Todd.

20:27.955 --> 20:29.217
-(clears throat)
-We|l... well, why
would I do that?

20:29.451 --> 20:30.895
If I was Todd, I'd
want to look like me.

20:31.100 --> 20:32.818
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh, look.

20:33.057 --> 20:35.343
It's Emily and Bo,
Tristan and Jessica,

20:35.550 --> 20:37.268
and there's Max talking
tolsabeL

20:37.468 --> 20:39.493
She is so not
good enough for him, really.

20:39.732 --> 20:41.484
(laughs)
What did you just say?

20:41.688 --> 20:42.825
(clears throat)

20:43.031 --> 20:45.317
Max and Isabel,
two of our suspects.

20:45.524 --> 20:46.468
Oh, oh!

20:46.790 --> 20:49.156
The prom king
and the sexpot.

20:49.361 --> 20:50.532
Oh, Lucifer, don't judge.

20:50.972 --> 20:52.189
There's so much more
to these people

20:52.391 --> 20:53.415
than their stereotypes suggest.

20:53.657 --> 20:54.453
Uaughsr
Right.

20:54.693 --> 20:55.557
It's just, ugh.

20:55.767 --> 20:56.859
Are you being serious?

20:57.148 --> 20:59.048
Yeah. Yeah, the books
are much deeper

20:59.296 --> 20:59.978
than you'd imagine.

21:00.217 --> 21:03.846
The characters, they're so
compelling and relatable

21:04.091 --> 21:05.615
and rich, and H mean...
(stammers)

21:05.856 --> 21:07.027
They're all here.

21:07.237 --> 21:08.727
And one of them
is most likely a killer.

21:09.692 --> 21:10.249
Right.

21:10.498 --> 21:11.556
-Right.
-Right.

21:11.956 --> 21:12.900
Okay, I'm gonna go
sign us in

21:13.106 --> 21:15.051
so that we can
finally meet the, um...

21:15.753 --> 21:17.345
so we can
question the suspects.

21:18.324 --> 21:19.348
(giggIeS)

21:20.357 --> 21:21.415
What is happening?

21:26.725 --> 21:29.398
Okay, so we each have
three people to question.

21:29.602 --> 21:30.819
Let's figure out
who was worried about

21:31.021 --> 21:32.352
Kathleen's book coming out.

21:32.556 --> 21:34.387
Yes, and where everyone was
the night of the murder.

21:34.589 --> 21:35.681
Oh, yeah.

21:36.430 --> 21:38.295
-Are you even listening to me?
-Mm-hmm.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.137
Do you know,
I can't believe I'm saying this,

21:40.343 --> 21:42.550
but focus, Detective.
I need that afterword.

21:42.760 --> 21:44.057
-Right, sorry.
-Right.

21:44.294 --> 21:45.283
-Oh, my God.
-What?

21:45.982 --> 21:46.698
It's Jessica.

21:47.478 --> 21:48.194
Can you believe

21:48.399 --> 21:50.037
that sophomore year,
she hooked up with Tristan

21:50.394 --> 21:52.191
on the Iaserball field?

21:52.389 --> 21:53.333
(exhales sharply)

21:53.885 --> 21:56.251
Don't worry,
Jessica's on my list.

21:57.606 --> 21:59.403
Okay, so,
I'm the first one here.

21:59.869 --> 22:01.848
I'll just go have a drink
at the bar.

22:02.094 --> 22:03.265
-HOSTESS:
Sure thing.
-Linda.

22:05.010 --> 22:06.147
Amenadiel,
what are you doing here?

22:06.352 --> 22:07.717
Well, Maze invited me.

22:07.925 --> 22:09.950
I thought she wanted to talk
after I stopped by yesterday.

22:10.150 --> 22:12.209
Maze is setting me up
on a blind date.

22:13.411 --> 22:14.855
What if you are my blind date?

22:15.060 --> 22:16.231
Well, that doesn't make
any sense.

22:16.441 --> 22:18.727
Unless she knows about us
and is trying to make us squirm.

22:19.127 --> 22:20.765
And torture
is her thing.

22:21.313 --> 22:22.109
MAZE:
Linda,

22:23.270 --> 22:24.259
this is Todd.

22:24.728 --> 22:25.410
Your date.

22:27.374 --> 22:28.136
Hello.

22:28.372 --> 22:29.669
This is a blue lobelia.

22:30.252 --> 22:32.379
Native Americans use them
to treat constipation.

22:35.124 --> 22:35.840
Thank you.

22:36.274 --> 22:36.956
(sighs)

22:37.157 --> 22:37.987
(grunts)

22:39.228 --> 22:41.253
But what are you two doing here?

22:42.796 --> 22:43.512
Double date.

22:44.791 --> 22:45.928
Isn't this great?

22:47.399 --> 22:48.423
Hmm.

22:49.010 --> 22:51.035
Yeah, uh, no...

22:51.811 --> 22:52.414
Hi.

22:52.923 --> 22:53.833
Great.

22:54.956 --> 22:57.288
("Let Me Blow Ya Mind"
by Eve playing)

22:57.488 --> 23:00.582
(both talking quietly)

23:01.209 --> 23:02.653
Excuse us. Isabel.

23:05.506 --> 23:06.370
Todd?

23:06.618 --> 23:07.562
Odd-bod Todd?

23:07.846 --> 23:08.403
Are...

23:09.150 --> 23:10.139
I'm sorry. You...

23:10.877 --> 23:12.708
just look so different.

23:12.910 --> 23:13.934
I'll take that as a compliment.

23:14.176 --> 23:15.120
Wow, I...

23:15.672 --> 23:16.809
Do you have a British accent?

23:17.053 --> 23:18.645
Well, I've had many accents
over the years,

23:18.894 --> 23:20.191
but this one is clearly
the best.

23:20.390 --> 23:21.527
(laughs)

23:21.771 --> 23:25.059
You're so funny and... so hot.

23:25.262 --> 23:26.980
-(chuckles)
I know.
-Mmm.

23:27.180 --> 23:29.705
Uh, but I need
to ask you a few questions.

23:29.904 --> 23:31.656
Sure. Let's catch up.

23:32.512 --> 23:34.377
Can you believe Kathleen's
coming out with another book?

23:34.584 --> 23:36.028
Oh, I believe it.

23:36.234 --> 23:38.600
That bitch loved
profiting off of us.

23:38.804 --> 23:40.135
Ugh, she sucks.

23:40.837 --> 23:43.237
But honestly, we're all, uh,
just trying to move on.

23:43.446 --> 23:45.346
Man, those books ruined
our lives.

23:45.824 --> 23:46.916
I had to move to Maine.

23:47.128 --> 23:48.299
Do you know
what was in her last book?

23:48.509 --> 23:49.953
What sparked her final idea?

23:51.156 --> 23:52.600
The books
are about you, correct?

23:53.535 --> 23:54.797
J‘J‘ And I ain't goin' nowhere... J‘J‘

23:54.992 --> 23:56.016
-Oh, for...
-CHLOE: So, do you know

23:56.258 --> 23:57.350
what happens in the new book?

23:57.563 --> 23:58.780
Are there any big secrets

23:58.982 --> 23:59.812
that come out or... (gasps)

24:00.478 --> 24:01.968
Does Isabel actually
get pregnant?

24:02.166 --> 24:03.918
Uh, who are you again?

24:04.122 --> 24:05.146
What were you doing
two nights ago?

24:05.350 --> 24:07.102
I was... at home?

24:07.306 --> 24:08.216
Doing a facial.

24:08.457 --> 24:09.481
I was with Tristan.

24:10.260 --> 24:11.090
I think.

24:11.756 --> 24:13.474
I mean, by the time I flew in,
it was really late.

24:13.674 --> 24:14.698
You're hiding something.

24:15.669 --> 24:16.579
And I think I know what.

24:17.165 --> 24:18.302
It's because
you were with Bo,

24:18.508 --> 24:19.873
and you didn't want Isabel
to find out.

24:20.081 --> 24:21.571
But, like, who cares
what Isabel thinks?

24:21.769 --> 24:24.169
Especially after what she did
to you in chemistry class?

24:24.416 --> 24:26.543
I mean, do you realize you're
still lucky to have your hand?

24:26.756 --> 24:28.326
ISABEL: It doesn't matter
where I was two nights ago.

24:28.904 --> 24:32.226
What matters is that tonight,
we're together.

24:33.162 --> 24:33.765
(sighs)

24:33.968 --> 24:35.538
So where were you
two nights ago?

24:35.771 --> 24:37.102
J‘J‘ That's hard to find... J‘J‘

24:37.305 --> 24:38.875
Let's go talk somewhere
a little quieter.

24:39.837 --> 24:40.781
Right.

24:40.988 --> 24:42.205
Yeah, talk. Uh-huh.

24:42.906 --> 24:45.659
(laughing)

24:45.898 --> 24:47.536
You two have so
much in common.

24:48.085 --> 24:48.642
Yeah.

24:48.890 --> 24:49.948
Linda, you're a therapist.

24:50.425 --> 24:52.905
And, Todd,
you're in therapy.

24:53.455 --> 24:54.137
Discuss.

24:55.374 --> 24:55.931
Oh.

24:56.141 --> 24:57.438
-You don't have to...
-l wet the bed.

25:00.552 --> 25:02.270
It's more common
than people think.

25:02.816 --> 25:03.760
You're lovely.

25:03.967 --> 25:06.174
I'm so glad she convinced me
to skip my reunion for this.

25:06.383 --> 25:07.020
(laughs awkwardly)

25:07.227 --> 25:09.092
Most serial killers wet the bed.

25:09.337 --> 25:10.395
(hisses)

25:10.603 --> 25:13.618
I smell a love
connection, don't you?

25:14.631 --> 25:16.428
Let's crank this
date up a notch.

25:17.086 --> 25:17.723
Waite r.

25:18.582 --> 25:19.412
(quietly):
Linda.

25:19.695 --> 25:21.060
This is getting out of control.

25:21.344 --> 25:23.369
We just have to get through
tonight. We can do it.

25:25.564 --> 25:26.588
(Maze sighs)

25:27.329 --> 25:28.159
So,Todd.

25:29.362 --> 25:30.306
Any hobbies?

25:30.628 --> 25:32.528
I make my own toothpaste.

25:35.270 --> 25:36.760
Where were you two nights ago?

25:37.418 --> 25:38.214
Uh...

25:38.454 --> 25:39.512
Come on, Tristan.

25:39.873 --> 25:40.817
I can't remember.

25:41.177 --> 25:42.394
Well, try.

25:42.712 --> 25:44.009
(chuckles nervously)
I told you, man,

25:44.208 --> 25:45.505
I don't, I don't remember
where I was.

25:45.857 --> 25:46.460
Oh!

25:47.162 --> 25:48.914
Tell me the truth now.

25:49.195 --> 25:50.719
Okay.
A couple nights ago,

25:50.921 --> 25:52.331
we all broke into
the school pool.

25:52.571 --> 25:54.675
You know, just a little party
before the party, you know?

25:54.872 --> 25:55.861
Well, why is that a secret?

25:56.062 --> 25:58.121
Because we didn't
invite everyone.

25:58.325 --> 25:59.997
Well, you, for instance.

26:00.665 --> 26:01.962
-What?
-I'm sorry, man.

26:02.161 --> 26:03.458
If we knew how cool
you had gotten,

26:03.696 --> 26:04.993
we totally would've
invited you.

26:05.575 --> 26:08.135
So what you're saying is
you all have the same alibi?

26:08.414 --> 26:10.086
(groans)

26:10.524 --> 26:11.661
Wasting our time here.

26:11.867 --> 26:12.629
(pants)

26:12.826 --> 26:14.236
Where's the detective?

26:15.588 --> 26:16.919
MAX:
I dig you, Chloe.

26:17.429 --> 26:18.999
You...
you're different.

26:19.577 --> 26:21.329
Too bad you didn't go
to high school with us.

26:21.956 --> 26:22.820
Yeah.

26:23.452 --> 26:24.362
That would have been great.

26:24.603 --> 26:25.627
Yeah.

26:26.406 --> 26:30.126
So, you were gonna tell me

26:30.587 --> 26:31.724
where you were two nights ago?

26:31.930 --> 26:33.340
(chuckles)

26:34.001 --> 26:37.402
Is that really what you want
to talk about, hmm?

26:38.221 --> 26:39.631
Well, I mean,

26:39.909 --> 26:42.434
I would really like to know.

26:42.824 --> 26:43.734
JESSICA:
Max!

26:44.704 --> 26:46.228
What are you doing? Who is that?

26:46.430 --> 26:47.920
-Uh...
-We were talking.

26:48.157 --> 26:49.294
And what do you care?

26:49.768 --> 26:52.020
You cheated on Max
with Tristan.

26:52.760 --> 26:54.022
That was 15 years ago.

26:54.793 --> 26:56.010
-MAX: Actually, I am still
kind of pissed...
-Right.

26:56.251 --> 26:57.969
-...about that.
-I'm sorry
I cheated on you,

26:58.169 --> 27:00.034
but I only did it because
I thought you slept with Emily.

27:00.547 --> 27:01.957
I would never
cheat on you, Jessica.

27:02.581 --> 27:03.605
I know that now.

27:04.230 --> 27:05.492
I read 3001.

27:06.033 --> 27:07.557
It showed me how much
you really loved me.

27:07.759 --> 27:09.966
-Hmm.
-JESSICA: You know,
sometimes I think about

27:10.713 --> 27:11.657
getting back together.

27:12.056 --> 27:12.818
CHLOE:
Mmm.

27:13.168 --> 27:14.499
-Me, too.
-Oh.

27:14.818 --> 27:16.228
EMILY: What's
going on here?

27:16.467 --> 27:18.753
Max, I thought it
was gonna be just us.

27:18.999 --> 27:20.261
I'm not really down
for a four-way.

27:20.495 --> 27:21.666
LUCIFER:
Make that five.

27:21.876 --> 27:24.049
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I'm not down, either.

27:26.096 --> 27:27.848
-Oh. So you were sleeping
with Emily...
-Oh.

27:28.091 --> 27:30.116
...weren't you? And then you
bring this rando in here, too?

27:30.316 --> 27:31.078
-I'm not a "rando."
-I-l just met

27:31.275 --> 27:32.446
-this rando.
-JESS|CA: We are never...

27:32.694 --> 27:33.752
-Hey.
-...getting back together.

27:33.960 --> 27:34.904
-You didn't tell her about us?
-MAX: Jessica, l--

27:35.111 --> 27:36.203
-this rando...
-Us?
-Yes, us.

27:36.454 --> 27:37.546
-That's what you said.
-MAX: I never said...

27:37.758 --> 27:38.895
-Oh, really, Max?
-...anything like that to you.

27:39.101 --> 27:41.740
Detective! None of these people
killed Kathleen.

27:41.978 --> 27:43.650
-What?
-"Killed"?

27:43.896 --> 27:44.920
-EMILY: What?
-"Detective"?

27:45.124 --> 27:46.261
LUCIFER: I have discovered
that they all

27:46.466 --> 27:47.490
have the same alibi.

27:47.732 --> 27:49.029
They broke onto
the campus two nights ago

27:49.228 --> 27:50.172
and had a party
by the pool.

27:50.418 --> 27:51.442
Didn't you? Hmm?

27:51.914 --> 27:53.939
So, Kathleen's killer, not here.

27:54.177 --> 27:55.474
Look at me,
being the responsible one.

27:56.632 --> 27:58.429
So that's why you were
all acting so strangely.

27:58.780 --> 27:59.769
MAX:
Yeah.

27:59.970 --> 28:01.688
Sorry we didn't invite
you, Todd, but, uh...

28:02.041 --> 28:02.803
you're not mad, right?

28:03.000 --> 28:04.024
You were hanging out
with Kathleen anyway.

28:04.228 --> 28:05.024
CHLOE:
What?

28:06.107 --> 28:06.869
Todd was hanging out

28:07.066 --> 28:08.431
with Kathleen two nights ago?

28:08.639 --> 28:09.936
Yeah, it's what he said
in the e-mail.

28:10.174 --> 28:11.744
Idid? I...

28:12.897 --> 28:14.114
What? He was an
awesome math tutor,

28:14.317 --> 28:15.409
and now he helps me
with my taxes.

28:15.621 --> 28:16.679
LUCIFER:
Detective.

28:17.117 --> 28:18.254
I think I'm the killer.

28:24.559 --> 28:26.663
(siren wailing)

28:27.513 --> 28:30.607
Apparently, Maze took Todd
to a steakhouse in Hollywood.

28:31.042 --> 28:33.146
It is an odd place
for a kidnapping, even for Maze.

28:33.574 --> 28:35.519
And what motive would Todd have
to kill Kathleen?

28:35.723 --> 28:37.748
-He's not even in the books.
-Wel|, exactly.

28:37.948 --> 28:40.280
Odd-bod Todd's probably tired
of being left out.

28:40.479 --> 28:41.741
Oh, right, should have
thought of that.

28:41.976 --> 28:43.341
Yes, you should have,

28:43.548 --> 28:45.800
but someone was making the case
all about themselves.

28:46.310 --> 28:48.517
Slightly unprofessional,
but I forgive you, Detective.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.558
I know. I can't believe
I let myself

28:50.760 --> 28:52.250
get so wrapped up
in all of that.

28:52.487 --> 28:53.397
Think I was just trying
to make up

28:53.599 --> 28:56.579
for all the fun, teenage drama
that I missed out on, you know?

28:56.783 --> 28:58.353
I didn't even get to go
to my own prom.

28:58.548 --> 29:00.072
It's ridiculous, I know.

29:01.310 --> 29:02.334
No, it's not.

29:04.072 --> 29:05.710
(engine revs)

29:06.719 --> 29:09.279
And that's the best way
to clean out an abscessed tooth.

29:09.481 --> 29:11.426
How delightful.

29:11.629 --> 29:13.347
lam so glad we did this.

29:13.777 --> 29:15.221
I have missed you guys.

29:15.427 --> 29:16.337
(chuckles)

29:16.578 --> 29:18.068
I mean...
(inhales sharply)

29:18.764 --> 29:21.437
(sighs) what's not
to miss, right?

29:23.598 --> 29:24.280
Mmm.

29:25.209 --> 29:26.267
-Mmm.
-Okay, stop.

29:26.590 --> 29:27.579
Uh,
that's inappropriate.

29:27.818 --> 29:28.682
(quietly):
We're in a restaurant, Maze.

29:28.930 --> 29:29.988
Who cares?

29:30.196 --> 29:31.834
I care. I mean, I'm just...

29:32.037 --> 29:33.982
it ju-- it just makes me
uncomfortable.

29:34.186 --> 29:35.210
Oh, it does?

29:36.104 --> 29:37.856
Well, does this make you
uncomfortable, too?

29:39.249 --> 29:40.341
AMENADIEL:
(groans) Maze!

29:40.554 --> 29:42.146
Maze! Why are you
acting like this?

29:43.316 --> 29:44.613
Because she knows.

29:45.656 --> 29:47.100
You know, don't you?

29:49.262 --> 29:50.479
And you're torturing us.

29:52.062 --> 29:53.359
That is so incredibly mean.

29:53.558 --> 29:55.048
I'm the one who's mean?

29:56.052 --> 29:58.225
You're the ones who've been
running around,

29:58.430 --> 30:00.716
lying to me about this fling
for weeks.

30:00.924 --> 30:02.516
LINDA: Of course we lied, Maze.
Look at you.

30:02.727 --> 30:03.989
You have a tendency
to overreact.

30:04.184 --> 30:05.549
I do not...

30:05.757 --> 30:06.894
-overreact.
-AMENADIEL: Maze.

30:07.100 --> 30:08.818
-Can we just calm down here?
-No!

30:09.862 --> 30:10.544
No.

30:11.051 --> 30:14.452
I will not take orders from
some pathetic daddy's boy.

30:15.808 --> 30:17.639
Tell me,
Amenadiel.

30:17.995 --> 30:20.907
Is this the divine purpose
your Father sent you here for?

30:21.907 --> 30:25.809
So you can bang
some... selfish human?

30:26.051 --> 30:27.848
Selfish? Selfish?

30:28.199 --> 30:31.794
All I do
is listen to your problems!

30:31.997 --> 30:33.089
Everyone's problems!

30:33.301 --> 30:36.395
So, yeah, for once,
I put myself first

30:36.600 --> 30:38.431
and did what makes me happy.

30:38.633 --> 30:40.737
So, sue me. Or torture me.
Or better yet,

30:40.973 --> 30:43.146
why don't you just skewer me
with one of your knives?

30:43.582 --> 30:44.879
But before you do,

30:45.999 --> 30:48.206
know that this wasn't
some fling,

30:48.646 --> 30:50.443
that what Amenadiel
and I found

30:50.640 --> 30:53.165
was completely unexpected,

30:54.515 --> 30:56.540
but 100% real.

30:59.502 --> 31:00.298
(inhales sharply)

31:00.998 --> 31:02.329
But you were my friend.

31:10.512 --> 31:11.422
Maze?

31:12.084 --> 31:14.029
LAPD, drop
the weapons.

31:21.483 --> 31:24.190
Yes, I indeed visited Kathleen
two nights ago.

31:24.399 --> 31:25.491
The night she was murdered.

31:26.700 --> 31:27.837
Kathleen was murdered?

31:28.542 --> 31:29.486
Oh, my.

31:31.994 --> 31:34.747
And y-you think I did it.

31:37.672 --> 31:39.503
(sighs)
Of course you do.

31:40.357 --> 31:41.039
The weirdo.

31:41.585 --> 31:42.609
The outcast.

31:43.541 --> 31:45.827
(sighs) I'm used to people
judging this book by its cover.

31:46.034 --> 31:48.013
That's why I swore off
social media.

31:48.490 --> 31:51.243
I still don't even know
how Kathleen tracked me down.

31:51.827 --> 31:53.044
Kathleen tracked you down?

31:53.975 --> 31:54.657
She wanted to discuss

31:54.896 --> 31:56.761
the final installment
of her series with me.

31:56.968 --> 31:58.105
Well, why would she talk
about that with you?

31:58.310 --> 31:59.299
You're not even
in the books.

31:59.538 --> 32:01.176
Yeah. I was surprised, too.

32:02.185 --> 32:04.551
Turns out, not only was
she going to include me

32:04.755 --> 32:05.619
in the final book,

32:06.366 --> 32:07.731
she was making me the hero.

32:07.977 --> 32:10.229
Wait, h-hold on, does that mean
she let you read the book?

32:10.586 --> 32:11.757
Uh, no.

32:11.967 --> 32:13.332
She didn't want me
to read it yet.

32:13.770 --> 32:15.442
Kathleen was waiting
for the reunion.

32:15.880 --> 32:17.984
She was excited
about finishing it in time

32:18.181 --> 32:18.943
to show everyone there.

32:19.141 --> 32:21.314
So you have no idea
what's in the afterword?

32:21.519 --> 32:23.271
The afterword? No.

32:23.897 --> 32:27.037
But she did tell me
about the story itself.

32:27.772 --> 32:30.912
How it had
a peaceful, grounded ending.

32:31.109 --> 32:34.476
No scandals,
no insiders versus outcasts.

32:34.677 --> 32:35.473
Just"

32:36.442 --> 32:38.922
people finally understanding
each other.

32:39.933 --> 32:41.264
The way
she described it, it...

32:42.119 --> 32:43.063
(sighs)

32:43.308 --> 32:44.878
...it sounded beautiful.

32:45.073 --> 32:46.791
-And boring.
-And not at all like

32:46.991 --> 32:49.630
the action-packed robot ending
that the editor told us about.

32:49.830 --> 32:51.127
I smell a new theory brewing.

32:51.556 --> 32:52.921
I got to go make a phone call.

32:53.666 --> 32:54.462
Mr. Green.

32:54.855 --> 32:57.028
Hi, uh,
Detective Decker, LAPD.

32:57.234 --> 32:58.326
Detective, how can I help you?

32:58.806 --> 33:01.513
Um, I was just wondering,
did Kathleen ever talk to you

33:01.722 --> 33:03.587
about working
with a ghostwriter?

33:03.793 --> 33:06.500
A ghostwriter? No, wish she had.

33:06.824 --> 33:08.268
Maybe she would have finished
the book sooner.

33:08.512 --> 33:09.536
Oh, I see.

33:09.778 --> 33:13.828
So-so, she never mentioned
a-a fan-fic writer

33:14.036 --> 33:15.298
named Ashley Collins?

33:15.570 --> 33:17.322
He's a-a manager
at an ice cream shop.

33:17.527 --> 33:19.017
I think the name's
Scoop Science.

33:19.253 --> 33:20.777
Actually, yeah,
Kathleen did mention some sort

33:21.018 --> 33:23.464
of overeager fan who invented
some special flavor for her.

33:23.703 --> 33:25.000
Kind of creeped her out.

33:25.583 --> 33:27.790
Wh-Why are you asking?
Is this Ashley a suspect?

33:28.153 --> 33:30.792
Oh, well, I can't divulge any of
that information at this time.

33:30.992 --> 33:33.199
But you've been
incredibly helpful, Mr. Green.

33:33.409 --> 33:34.353
Thank you.

33:36.171 --> 33:37.468
You in the mood
for some ice cream?

33:54.239 --> 33:56.070
Hello, Vincent.

34:00.722 --> 34:03.247
Looking for Ashley?
Sorry to disappoint.

34:03.484 --> 34:05.122
-What are you doing here?
-CHLOE: Drop the gun.

34:05.978 --> 34:07.775
You're under arrest
for the murder of Kathleen Pike.

34:08.011 --> 34:09.501
You lied to us, Vincent.

34:09.737 --> 34:11.147
I called Ashley.
He confirmed

34:11.310 --> 34:13.642
that the robot ending was
his version and not Kathleen's.

34:13.842 --> 34:15.742
-Th-That means nothing.
-But it is suspicious.

34:15.952 --> 34:17.283
So I looked at traffic footage.

34:17.486 --> 34:19.158
You went to Kathleen's house
the night of the murder.

34:19.366 --> 34:21.425
But, Detective, didn't
he tell us he didn't go

34:21.629 --> 34:22.926
over there
till the next morning?

34:23.202 --> 34:26.069
Fine. Yes,
I was at Kathleen's that night.

34:26.731 --> 34:29.017
If you had waited five years
for that damn book like I did,

34:29.301 --> 34:30.939
you wouldn't want to wait
another second for it either.

34:31.143 --> 34:32.553
But once you got it,
you didn't like what you read,

34:32.754 --> 34:34.324
-did you?
-I was horrified.

34:34.519 --> 34:37.044
She ended the series
in the most boring way possible.

34:37.242 --> 34:38.766
And you were worried
about the sales.

34:38.969 --> 34:39.765
We'd lose millions

34:39.966 --> 34:41.684
without the right ending.
Ashley's.

34:41.884 --> 34:43.909
So you and Kathleen argued
over which one to use.

34:44.147 --> 34:45.819
She refused to use
the good version.

34:46.296 --> 34:49.083
So, yeah, I threw
her stupid typewriter at her.

34:49.288 --> 34:50.858
But even with Kathleen gone,
you knew

34:51.091 --> 34:53.264
that you couldn't publish
Ashley's ending as hers.

34:53.469 --> 34:55.528
So you came here
to tie up the one loose end.

34:55.771 --> 34:57.341
Now, tell me, Vincent--

34:58.341 --> 34:59.603
Kathleen's manuscript,

34:59.914 --> 35:00.517
where is it?

35:00.720 --> 35:01.630
I don't have it.

35:01.832 --> 35:02.662
l destroyed it.

35:02.983 --> 35:04.120
You did what?

35:04.594 --> 35:07.119
I couldn't let anybody read
that pathetic joke of an ending!

35:07.318 --> 35:08.228
But I needed to read
the afterword

35:08.430 --> 35:09.874
so I could fix my problem,

35:10.080 --> 35:11.217
-and now you're saying
it's gone?!
-CHLOE: Lucifer,

35:11.422 --> 35:12.332
back off.

35:12.573 --> 35:13.403
What did it say?

35:13.609 --> 35:14.940
-The afterword?
-Yes!

35:15.144 --> 35:17.271
How did she fix her block?

35:17.484 --> 35:19.076
I don't know!
She said inspiration came

35:19.287 --> 35:20.151
when she realized
she couldn't go back

35:20.361 --> 35:21.305
and change what she'd done.

35:21.512 --> 35:22.683
Well, that doesn't
help me at all!

35:22.931 --> 35:23.875
Lucifer, stop!

35:24.082 --> 35:25.492
Now I'm never gonna
figure out how to...

35:34.209 --> 35:35.619
-(handcuffs tighten)
-Are you okay?

35:35.897 --> 35:37.159
No, Detective.

35:38.045 --> 35:39.342
Far from it.

35:42.534 --> 35:44.434
("Bad Love" by RY X playing)

35:52.162 --> 35:54.835
Remind me to never go on
another blind date ever again.

35:55.653 --> 35:57.553
Mm-mm. Oh, I don't know,

35:57.763 --> 36:00.243
I thought you and Todd
really made a connection.

36:00.755 --> 36:01.972
(chuckles softly)

36:02.980 --> 36:04.197
Okay, so I've been thinking.

36:04.400 --> 36:05.890
-Yeah.
-A lot.

36:06.088 --> 36:08.613
J‘J‘ Tie you up, not enough... J‘J‘

36:09.233 --> 36:10.598
Pretty crazy what Maze did.

36:10.845 --> 36:11.834
I'll say.

36:13.031 --> 36:13.975
But she was right.

36:15.525 --> 36:17.322
We never should have lied
to her.

36:18.402 --> 36:20.427
And I never should have lied
to myself.

36:20.934 --> 36:22.026
Yourself?

36:23.197 --> 36:24.107
What do you mean?

36:24.655 --> 36:27.635
As much as I tried
to tell myself otherwise,

36:28.913 --> 36:30.938
I knew what we were doing
was going to hurt her.

36:31.253 --> 36:32.823
And I did it anyway.

36:33.478 --> 36:35.457
That's how much I wanted
to be with you, Amenadiel.

36:38.542 --> 36:39.986
Look, you've made me happier
than I've been

36:40.191 --> 36:42.250
in a long, long time.

36:43.452 --> 36:44.248
But...

36:45.600 --> 36:47.192
I was being selfish.

36:47.403 --> 36:48.461
Maze is my friend.

36:51.393 --> 36:52.485
J‘J‘ I'll be your warmth here... J‘J‘

36:52.735 --> 36:54.100
(sighs)

36:54.922 --> 36:56.492
I can't be with you anymore.

36:57.300 --> 36:58.096
J‘J‘ I'll be your back... J‘J‘

36:58.336 --> 36:59.906
Not when it does this to her.

37:02.556 --> 37:03.693
II I put you in the corner... J‘J‘

37:03.937 --> 37:05.996
You know, it's not fair for her
to take this away from us.

37:06.200 --> 37:08.953
I know. I don't expect you
to understand.

37:09.499 --> 37:10.409
J‘J‘ Please, baby... J‘J‘

37:10.650 --> 37:12.368
But I don't want to be
that kind of person.

37:13.949 --> 37:15.246
It's just not who I am.

37:15.637 --> 37:17.468
J‘J‘ I'll be your warmth here... J‘J‘

37:18.438 --> 37:19.530
Actually, I do understand.

37:19.934 --> 37:20.616
Um...

37:22.005 --> 37:23.905
I may have strayed
from who I am as well.

37:27.568 --> 37:28.478
J‘J‘ I'm holding your bag
for you... J‘J‘

37:28.680 --> 37:30.625
(sighs deeply)

37:33.591 --> 37:36.037
J‘J‘ Please, baby,
back for bad love J‘J‘

37:36.238 --> 37:38.263
So I guess this is it.

37:41.646 --> 37:42.476
I guess so.

37:42.682 --> 37:45.435
J‘J‘ How can I wait? J‘J‘

37:49.050 --> 37:51.154
J‘J‘ Holding your bag for you. J‘J‘

37:52.848 --> 37:53.758
Lucifer!

37:54.344 --> 37:55.026
I'm here.

37:55.226 --> 37:56.488
-You wanted to see me?
-Yes,

37:56.684 --> 37:57.981
I wanted to check on you.

37:58.180 --> 38:01.160
That you were back to being
the good detective.

38:02.055 --> 38:03.579
"The good detective"?

38:03.781 --> 38:05.612
Mm. Well, I like
our partnership much better

38:05.853 --> 38:08.378
when you do all the work and
I'm the fun, irresponsible one.

38:08.807 --> 38:10.069
Oh. Yeah.

38:10.264 --> 38:12.710
-I did get a little carried
away at that reunion.
-Hmm.

38:12.911 --> 38:13.741
Just a smidge.

38:13.947 --> 38:15.164
(both chuckle softly)

38:15.597 --> 38:18.350
Y-You know,
it made me realize something.

38:18.589 --> 38:20.841
(sighs) All of that high school
drama that I missed out on--

38:21.197 --> 38:22.994
the-the girly gossip,

38:23.192 --> 38:24.864
the hallway crushes,

38:25.072 --> 38:26.664
all those school dances--

38:27.565 --> 38:29.510
that's just not who I am. I...

38:30.136 --> 38:32.696
I like being
the responsible adult.

38:33.396 --> 38:34.420
Right.

38:34.816 --> 38:38.183
So you no longer desire any
of that high school poppycock?

38:39.112 --> 38:40.522
(sighs)
No.

38:41.491 --> 38:42.822
Well then...
(clears throat)

38:43.754 --> 38:46.279
lguess
you won't be wanting this.

38:56.183 --> 38:56.945
Detective...

38:58.830 --> 39:00.274
...will you go to the prom
with me?

39:13.407 --> 39:15.466
("Only You" by Yazoo playing)

39:18.893 --> 39:20.918
I can't believe you did this.

39:22.039 --> 39:24.439
J‘J‘ Looking from a window above J‘J‘

39:24.647 --> 39:26.774
J‘J‘ It's like a story of love J‘J‘

39:27.601 --> 39:30.206
J‘J‘ Can you hear me? J‘J‘

39:30.709 --> 39:33.041
J‘J‘ Came back only yesterday J‘J‘

39:33.240 --> 39:35.845
I: I'm moving farther away J‘J‘

39:36.501 --> 39:38.787
U Want you near me J‘J‘

39:39.954 --> 39:40.750
I: All I needed... J‘J‘

39:40.951 --> 39:42.122
Thank you, Lucifer.

39:42.370 --> 39:43.780
N You gave J‘J‘

39:44.365 --> 39:46.651
N All I needed
for another day... J‘J‘

39:46.897 --> 39:48.228
I'm just glad you got
what you needed.

39:48.432 --> 39:49.842
J‘J‘ And all I ever knew J‘J‘

39:50.043 --> 39:52.603
But you, you never found
that inspiration

39:52.805 --> 39:54.295
that you were looking for.

39:55.106 --> 39:57.631
Are you ever gonna tell me what
it is you were trying to solve?

39:58.214 --> 40:01.456
Uh, it's-it's complicated.

40:02.165 --> 40:03.757
Well, tell me anyhow?

40:05.157 --> 40:06.101
Very well.

40:06.922 --> 40:08.139
Along time ago,

40:08.571 --> 40:10.778
dear old Dad put a curse on a...

40:11.449 --> 40:12.666
well, a friend of mine.

40:13.405 --> 40:15.305
And I want to break that curse,

40:15.783 --> 40:17.956
show my Father He's not
as powerful as He thinks,

40:18.162 --> 40:19.732
that He can't control him.

40:20.809 --> 40:21.446
Or me.

40:22.113 --> 40:24.240
Well, crazy metaphor aside,

40:24.491 --> 40:25.981
can I offer some advice?

40:26.179 --> 40:27.817
Oh...
(chuckles) please.

40:28.750 --> 40:31.275
If I've learned anything
from this experience,

40:31.780 --> 40:33.111
it's that it's better
to move forward

40:33.315 --> 40:34.759
than stay stuck in the past.

40:35.501 --> 40:37.628
It's just like Kathleen
realized.

40:38.609 --> 40:39.940
We can't rewrite history.

40:43.826 --> 40:45.236
You can't.

40:45.974 --> 40:47.066
But maybe I can.

40:47.278 --> 40:49.451
Uaughsy
Detective, you're a genius.

40:49.695 --> 40:50.411
Thanks?

40:50.654 --> 40:51.985
You've just given me my idea.

40:53.033 --> 40:54.477
All I need to do is go back

40:54.682 --> 40:57.162
and undo the reason it exists
in the first place.

40:58.020 --> 40:59.078
-Oh.
-(|aughs)

41:00.091 --> 41:00.694
Thank you.

41:00.935 --> 41:02.459
J‘J‘You gave J‘J‘

41:02.661 --> 41:05.983
N” All I needed for another day J‘J‘

41:06.191 --> 41:09.251
J‘J‘ And all I ever knew J‘J‘

41:10.065 --> 41:11.430
J‘J‘ Only you. J‘J‘
