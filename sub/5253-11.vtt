00:00.010 --> 00:01.377
Previously on "Awkward"...

00:01.379 --> 00:03.444
Anyone caught getting saucy on the sauce

00:03.469 --> 00:05.812
will be banned from walking at graduation.

00:05.836 --> 00:07.635
Miss Saxton, you're not
walking at graduation.

00:07.637 --> 00:09.148
But I'm valedictorian!

00:09.172 --> 00:10.971
Matty, wait. I love you.

00:10.973 --> 00:12.339
I always have.

00:15.398 --> 00:17.132
After three torturous years

00:17.134 --> 00:19.686
of ups and downs and just
a week before graduation

00:19.711 --> 00:21.911
Matty and I were together again,

00:21.913 --> 00:25.149
and it was bliss, pure bliss.

00:25.438 --> 00:28.710
I got an A-minus on my AP English final,

00:28.727 --> 00:30.326
then Matty and I had sex.

00:30.328 --> 00:33.637
We emptied out our lockers,
and then we had sex.

00:33.662 --> 00:35.195
We walked in the moonlight.

00:35.220 --> 00:37.031
We saw the North Star,

00:37.063 --> 00:38.710
and then we had sex.

00:39.297 --> 00:41.931
Time flew by, and suddenly
there was only one day

00:41.956 --> 00:46.025
of school left... graduation day.

00:46.027 --> 00:48.293
Sleeping with Matty...
and I mean just sleeping,

00:48.295 --> 00:49.695
snuggling, and spooning...

00:49.697 --> 00:52.164
I felt safe and secure and happy.

00:52.166 --> 00:54.634
In some ways it was even better than sex.

00:54.636 --> 00:56.268
I want to wake up like this every morning

00:56.270 --> 00:57.859
for the rest of my life.

01:01.609 --> 01:04.265
I wish we had more time before college.

01:04.530 --> 01:06.179
At least we have all summer.

01:07.448 --> 01:08.880
Actually...

01:08.882 --> 01:12.251
- Our high school graduate!
- So proud of you!

01:12.253 --> 01:15.424
Come on out, Matty. We can see you.

01:16.723 --> 01:18.790
- Oh.
- Well, whoo.

01:18.792 --> 01:20.926
Good morning to you, too.

01:28.601 --> 01:29.935
Oh, relax, Jenna.

01:29.937 --> 01:32.015
We know you're sexually active.

01:32.472 --> 01:34.357
We were just sleeping, Mom.

01:34.382 --> 01:38.977
Anyway, we're cool with
you having sex in our house

01:38.979 --> 01:41.279
because you're both practically adults.

01:41.281 --> 01:42.614
Yeah, I'm only semi-cool.

01:42.616 --> 01:45.031
Well, Matty wasn't semi anything.

01:45.056 --> 01:46.384
- Mom!
- Jesus, Lacey.

01:46.386 --> 01:48.652
Uh, good morning.

01:50.609 --> 01:52.723
Jeez, Mom, would you
cool it with the pictures?

01:52.725 --> 01:54.825
Jenna, this is your
one and only graduation.

01:54.827 --> 01:56.694
I want to remember it forever. Now, cheese.

01:56.696 --> 01:59.196
- Today is going to be epic.
- I know.

01:59.198 --> 02:01.565
We're free, and we're
adults, and we're together.

02:01.567 --> 02:04.194
Take a series, and make
sure the glow filter's on.

02:04.870 --> 02:06.536
About a thousand pictures later,

02:06.538 --> 02:09.473
we finally got out the door
to the senior breakfast.

02:09.475 --> 02:12.442
Everyone was giddy and
excited, most of all me.

02:12.444 --> 02:14.611
After being a non-entity sophomore year,

02:14.613 --> 02:17.847
then flailing through junior
year, in my senior year

02:17.849 --> 02:20.250
I'd gotten my [bleep]
together, gotten into college,

02:20.252 --> 02:21.918
and got with Matty.

02:21.920 --> 02:24.654
Life was good, and graduation
was going to be great.

02:24.656 --> 02:26.089
This is going to be a suck-uation

02:26.091 --> 02:27.924
if the class gift doesn't get here stat.

02:27.926 --> 02:30.093
- Relax, T, it'll get here.
- Relax?

02:30.095 --> 02:31.494
This is my entire high school legacy

02:31.496 --> 02:33.496
engraved onto one piece of granite,

02:33.498 --> 02:34.831
and, I mean, let's be real.

02:34.833 --> 02:36.232
I did all the work picking it out.

02:36.234 --> 02:37.667
You guys had a bake
sale, and you know what?

02:37.692 --> 02:38.835
I'm just gonna say it now.

02:38.837 --> 02:41.070
Those lemon squares were
subpar... too much acid.

02:41.072 --> 02:43.106
Your stupid bench
presentation is the warm-up

02:43.108 --> 02:45.675
for my valedictory
address, so keep it snappy.

02:45.677 --> 02:47.342
I'm about to tell all the lowlifes

02:47.344 --> 02:48.944
that infest this wretched school

02:48.946 --> 02:52.800
exactly what I think of them
and that's gonna take some time.

02:54.984 --> 02:57.165
Sadie, what are you doing here?

02:57.587 --> 02:59.154
Um, graduating.

02:59.156 --> 03:00.889
What are you doing in a bathrobe?

03:00.891 --> 03:02.758
Miss Saxton, this breakfast

03:02.760 --> 03:05.360
is for seniors participating
in the graduation ceremony.

03:05.362 --> 03:08.796
Since you were caught with
a flask of alcohol at prom,

03:08.798 --> 03:10.532
you cannot walk with your class.

03:10.534 --> 03:12.567
We already discussed this at length.

03:12.569 --> 03:14.269
Come on, you weren't serious.

03:14.271 --> 03:16.638
Anyway, my name's already
in the program, so...

03:16.640 --> 03:19.507
Oh, I am dead serious. Go home.

03:19.509 --> 03:20.908
This day needs to be perfect,

03:20.910 --> 03:22.810
and I will not let you not tarnish it.

03:22.812 --> 03:25.647
Okay, your obsession with our graduation

03:25.649 --> 03:26.981
is kind of pathetic.

03:26.983 --> 03:28.582
If you want this day to be perfect,

03:28.584 --> 03:31.986
it needs its valedictorian
and her speech, so I'll stay.

03:31.988 --> 03:33.498
You're welcome.

03:33.523 --> 03:37.024
I am not welcome, thank you very much.

03:37.851 --> 03:40.795
You can leave right now with
your last shred of dignity,

03:40.797 --> 03:43.197
or you can be dragged
out like a crazy woman

03:43.199 --> 03:46.296
by the security I got just for today.

03:46.669 --> 03:49.304
You want it to end like this, Valerie?

03:50.506 --> 03:52.138
Fine!

03:52.140 --> 03:56.142
All your sad power trip shows
is that you're a pathetic loser

03:56.144 --> 03:58.679
who sucks at her job!

03:58.681 --> 04:05.118
So good-bye, all you
losers, slunts, and dunces!

04:05.120 --> 04:06.752
Not nice knowing you!

04:06.754 --> 04:10.556
Enjoy your lame graduation
and your tragic tumble

04:10.558 --> 04:13.492
into the sad abyss of mediocrity!

04:21.034 --> 04:22.801
If we get the drone high enough,

04:22.803 --> 04:24.637
the whole busted graduation mess

04:24.639 --> 04:25.970
will look like a hazy, happy blur.

04:25.972 --> 04:28.306
Yeah, the cloying cluster of basic bitches

04:28.308 --> 04:31.543
will be abstracted into a
benign cloud of nothingness.

04:36.915 --> 04:38.816
Get that [bleep] thing away from me,

04:38.818 --> 04:40.352
you pencil-[bleep] pillheads!

04:40.354 --> 04:41.553
Oh, Sadie, it likes you.

04:41.555 --> 04:42.587
Say hi.

04:42.589 --> 04:44.788
Is that nose hair?

04:44.790 --> 04:47.658
I will crush you and your little air turd

04:47.660 --> 04:49.893
if you ever come near me again,

04:49.895 --> 04:52.095
which you won't because
this is the last time

04:52.097 --> 04:54.598
I ever step foot on this wretched campus.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.734
Uh! Aah!

04:59.838 --> 05:01.204
I can't believe this.

05:01.206 --> 05:02.606
But, you know, Val's being so harsh.

05:02.608 --> 05:04.006
I'm actually on Sadie's side.

05:04.008 --> 05:06.008
Yeah, you should be. This is really unfair.

05:06.010 --> 05:07.343
I know sometimes Sadie can seem like

05:07.345 --> 05:09.242
a super meanie lady dog,

05:09.267 --> 05:10.880
but it's just her way of being nice.

05:10.882 --> 05:11.881
It didn't sound like her speech

05:11.883 --> 05:12.948
was going to be super nice.

05:12.950 --> 05:14.484
It's here.

05:14.486 --> 05:15.752
Thank G! The bench is here.

05:15.754 --> 05:18.947
Come on, Jake. Come on.

05:20.157 --> 05:21.691
Amaze-nugs.

05:21.693 --> 05:23.592
This bench will be on
the PHHS campus forever,

05:23.594 --> 05:27.121
and generations of students will
sit on it and think about us.

05:28.231 --> 05:30.206
WTF?

05:30.367 --> 05:34.636
F, F, F, F! "The ass of 2015?"

05:34.638 --> 05:36.271
Why would you do this?

05:36.273 --> 05:38.573
Weren't you going for a prank?
I just went by your email.

05:38.575 --> 05:39.775
Here is my email.

05:39.777 --> 05:42.023
"Thank you for your font samples.

05:42.048 --> 05:44.678
We would like bench number
three, granite, Grecian.

05:44.680 --> 05:46.247
We would like our bench inscribed:

05:46.249 --> 05:49.884
"Rest your weary bones
here and reflect on the..."

05:49.886 --> 05:51.386
OMG,

05:51.388 --> 05:52.753
"Ass of 2015."

05:52.755 --> 05:54.455
There it is in black and white.

05:54.457 --> 05:55.985
WTF?

05:56.010 --> 05:57.343
HTF did this happen?

05:57.345 --> 05:59.579
The perfect storm of abbrevs, autocorrect,

05:59.581 --> 06:01.281
and manic multitasking.

06:02.582 --> 06:03.582
It was my flask.

06:03.584 --> 06:04.816
I have to tell Miss Marks.

06:04.818 --> 06:06.418
Sadie shouldn't take the fall for me.

06:06.420 --> 06:07.619
Matty, don't.

06:07.621 --> 06:08.887
Val is on a tear.

06:08.889 --> 06:10.222
Let me explain it to her.

06:10.224 --> 06:12.491
- Why? It was my bad, I'll...
- Val loves me.

06:12.493 --> 06:15.094
She's bound to be more lenient
on an alcohol infraction

06:15.096 --> 06:17.429
if she knows it was,
you know, my boyfriend.

06:17.431 --> 06:19.465
You don't have to.

06:19.866 --> 06:21.333
I want to.

06:21.335 --> 06:23.034
You were the best part
of high school for me.

06:23.036 --> 06:24.970
We have to graduate together.

06:24.972 --> 06:26.972
Don't worry, I got this.

06:31.916 --> 06:33.898
Oh, Biggie, you can't see me like this.

06:33.923 --> 06:35.250
Um, actually, it's Jenna.

06:35.252 --> 06:37.107
Oh, J-Town, come on in.

06:38.322 --> 06:40.288
Timelessly elegant or trendily trashy?

06:40.290 --> 06:42.624
I don't want to look dated in
the pictures ten years from now.

06:42.626 --> 06:45.194
I don't think anyone's gonna
be looking at your nails.

06:45.196 --> 06:46.894
Okay, give me some
space. You're crowding me.

06:46.896 --> 06:49.964
So Val, my girl,

06:49.966 --> 06:51.733
you must know that everyone's really upset

06:51.735 --> 06:53.034
about Sadie not walking.

06:53.036 --> 06:54.969
Not everyone, Jenna.

06:54.971 --> 06:56.270
I'll give you a hint,

06:56.272 --> 06:58.139
she's got two thumbs, three cats,

06:58.141 --> 06:59.540
and is delighted that Sadie

06:59.542 --> 07:01.542
isn't going to be there
to ruin her perfect day.

07:01.544 --> 07:03.644
- Any idea who I'm talking about?
- You?

07:03.646 --> 07:05.046
I'm actually talking about me.

07:05.048 --> 07:07.115
But the flask wasn't even Sadie's.

07:07.117 --> 07:08.916
She was just holding it for someone else

07:08.918 --> 07:11.084
and was unlucky enough
to get caught with it.

07:11.086 --> 07:13.120
Yeah, right. If it wasn't Sadie's flask,

07:13.122 --> 07:14.712
then whose flask was it?

07:15.558 --> 07:17.023
The flask was Matty's.

07:17.025 --> 07:19.092
He feels terrible and wanted
to tell to you himself,

07:19.094 --> 07:23.029
but I wanted to tell you first
because you and I are friends.

07:23.031 --> 07:24.277
We are,

07:24.634 --> 07:29.403
which is why I wish you would
have said any other name.

07:29.405 --> 07:31.956
I'm sorry, but he can't
walk at graduation either.

07:35.244 --> 07:37.860
Matty, I am such an idiot.

07:37.885 --> 07:39.685
- I'm so sorry.
- What happened?

07:39.687 --> 07:42.631
She still won't let Sadie walk,

07:43.724 --> 07:45.391
and now you can't either.

07:45.393 --> 07:47.508
I feel terrible. I'm so sorry.

07:48.096 --> 07:50.063
No, it's not that big a deal.

07:50.065 --> 07:51.664
I'll just... I'll see you after.

07:51.666 --> 07:53.566
Matty, if you can't walk, then
I don't want to walk either.

07:53.568 --> 07:55.168
No, Jenna, I want you to walk.

07:55.170 --> 07:56.902
I don't want to do it without you.

07:56.904 --> 07:58.017
If you miss graduation,

07:58.042 --> 07:59.705
you're gonna regret it
for the rest of your life.

07:59.707 --> 08:01.941
It was my flask, so whatever, it's fair.

08:01.943 --> 08:03.508
We'll hang out after no matter what.

08:03.510 --> 08:05.944
Listen, I've got to go
intercept my parents.

08:07.000 --> 08:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:22.295 --> 08:24.420
Sadie would hate this.

08:24.635 --> 08:26.268
I wish she was here.

08:26.270 --> 08:27.470
It sucks,

08:27.495 --> 08:30.766
but we all have to dig deep
and show some school spirit.

08:30.791 --> 08:31.807
That's hard to do when the person

08:31.809 --> 08:34.208
I care about most can't even be here.

08:38.881 --> 08:40.688
What the what?

08:41.318 --> 08:42.650
No, not today!

08:42.653 --> 08:44.953
I specifically made sure
that Theo and Cole had nothing

08:44.955 --> 08:45.987
to do with this slide show.

08:45.989 --> 08:47.755
I am going to shut this down.

08:47.757 --> 08:50.325
I'd been dreaming of the
perfect graduation, but why?

08:50.327 --> 08:53.094
High school hadn't been perfect,

08:53.096 --> 08:55.539
so why should graduation be?

08:55.799 --> 08:57.330
Stop.

08:57.970 --> 09:00.168
This was what high school was really like,

09:00.788 --> 09:02.547
the good and the bad.

09:02.572 --> 09:05.006
Don't be afraid of the truth, people!

09:05.337 --> 09:07.758
Is this really how you
want to remember this place,

09:07.783 --> 09:10.391
with pictures of people getting beat up?

09:10.416 --> 09:13.540
The slide show, the class
gift... is nothing sacred?

09:13.549 --> 09:14.648
What's not sacred?

09:14.650 --> 09:15.950
This is our legacy now.

09:15.952 --> 09:18.385
We're the ass of 2015.

09:18.387 --> 09:20.287
But asses aren't really bad, Tamara.

09:20.289 --> 09:23.724
I mean, we all need them
to, you know, poop and stuff,

09:23.726 --> 09:24.992
and you can't sit without one,

09:24.994 --> 09:26.426
so it makes perfect sense for a bench.

09:26.428 --> 09:28.028
It's like a cute little pun or something.

09:28.030 --> 09:30.029
See, silver lining.

09:30.031 --> 09:31.464
She's oddly wise.

09:31.466 --> 09:34.233
- It's unsettling.
- But she's absolutely right.

09:34.235 --> 09:37.069
Maybe graduation wasn't
about being perfect.

09:37.071 --> 09:40.139
Maybe it was just about being together.

09:47.314 --> 09:49.616
Everybody, listen up.

09:49.618 --> 09:52.751
We all know that Sadie
Saxton and Matty McKibben

09:52.753 --> 09:56.421
have been kicked out of
graduation for drinking at prom,

09:56.423 --> 09:59.057
but who the hell wasn't drinking at prom?

09:59.059 --> 10:01.192
The right thing to do is to stand together

10:01.194 --> 10:03.061
and demand they be let back in.

10:03.063 --> 10:04.863
Matty's cool, but Sadie?

10:04.865 --> 10:06.064
She's such a bitch.

10:06.066 --> 10:08.901
Um, did you see that slide show?

10:08.903 --> 10:11.402
We've all messed up sometime,

10:11.404 --> 10:14.304
and we've been through so much together,

10:14.306 --> 10:18.142
the good, the bad,
friends, enemies, together,

10:18.144 --> 10:20.411
and we should graduate together.

10:20.413 --> 10:23.548
If Sadie doesn't walk,
none of us should walk.

10:23.550 --> 10:25.149
Sadie's rude.

10:25.151 --> 10:27.018
She told me that I reeked
and needed to use deodorant.

10:27.020 --> 10:28.953
She was right about that.

10:28.955 --> 10:30.420
Well, I did get laid

10:30.422 --> 10:33.056
after I started using it, one whole time,

10:33.058 --> 10:35.025
and another two times I came pretty close.

10:35.027 --> 10:36.826
She said my boyfriend was a lying douche

10:36.828 --> 10:38.428
who would cheat on me.

10:38.430 --> 10:39.529
Nailed it.

10:39.531 --> 10:41.898
Her harsh truth may hurt sometimes,

10:41.900 --> 10:43.633
but it is our harsh truth.

10:43.635 --> 10:48.071
If we stand together, they can't
keep us all from graduating.

10:48.073 --> 10:50.339
If anyone who was drinking at prom

10:50.341 --> 10:55.044
is not allowed to walk, well,
then I have to admit I drank,

10:55.046 --> 10:56.869
and I should not walk.

10:59.784 --> 11:01.204
I drank.

11:01.486 --> 11:03.453
I really want to walk so bad,

11:03.455 --> 11:05.570
but I drank.

11:05.856 --> 11:07.290
I was totally drinking.

11:07.292 --> 11:08.723
I might be drunk right now.

11:08.725 --> 11:10.892
I hope I'm drunk because this is sick.

11:10.894 --> 11:13.528
- I drank.
- I butt chugged.

11:13.530 --> 11:14.796
I drank!

11:20.447 --> 11:22.726
We have conferred

11:22.751 --> 11:25.109
and in the spirit of fairness

11:25.134 --> 11:27.875
have decided to let Matty McKibben walk.

11:27.877 --> 11:29.077
Yes.

11:31.478 --> 11:32.776
However,

11:33.382 --> 11:35.116
due to her volatile nature,

11:35.118 --> 11:36.784
proclivity for hate speech,

11:36.786 --> 11:38.620
and pancake abuse,

11:38.622 --> 11:41.589
we cannot grant Sadie Saxton a reprieve.

11:44.236 --> 11:45.860
Hey, I got your text.

11:45.862 --> 11:47.394
- That's awesome.
- I know.

11:47.396 --> 11:49.696
The whole class stood up
against Val and Principal Cox,

11:49.698 --> 11:51.132
so they had to let you walk.

11:51.134 --> 11:52.933
That's great. What about Sadie?

11:52.935 --> 11:54.401
It wasn't just the alcohol.

11:54.403 --> 11:56.637
She went on a rampage and insulted Val.

11:56.639 --> 11:58.972
Jenna, I'm not walking without Sadie.

11:58.974 --> 12:00.274
But, Matty, your conscience is clear.

12:00.276 --> 12:01.842
Val knows it was your flask.

12:01.844 --> 12:04.077
Sadie's been such a big part
of my life, of all of our lives.

12:04.079 --> 12:07.047
Yeah, and a big part of
making mine miserable.

12:07.049 --> 12:09.430
Matty, I thought you would be proud of me.

12:09.455 --> 12:11.352
I mean, I rallied the entire class.

12:11.354 --> 12:15.088
Does that mean you have to
choose her over me, over us?

12:15.090 --> 12:17.626
Jenna, without her there would be no us.

12:18.455 --> 12:19.693
What do you mean?

12:19.695 --> 12:21.361
You have any guess who
might have told me that...

12:21.363 --> 12:24.398
not just told me, pushed
me to go after you at prom?

12:24.867 --> 12:26.332
But she hates me.

12:26.334 --> 12:28.493
And she would kill me
if she knew I told you.

12:29.228 --> 12:31.171
Like her or hate her, Sadie's
been a great friend to me,

12:31.173 --> 12:32.405
and she's always had my back,

12:32.407 --> 12:35.108
and I don't want to walk without her.

12:39.189 --> 12:41.891
Okay, seniors, this is not a drill.

12:41.893 --> 12:43.292
This is the real deal,

12:43.294 --> 12:46.029
so I'm asking you to behave
with the dignity and respect

12:46.031 --> 12:48.231
that this sacred rite deserves.

12:48.233 --> 12:50.158
All right, people, chop, chop!

12:51.126 --> 12:52.680
Wait, where did Jenna go?

12:52.705 --> 12:53.903
Where is Matty?

12:53.905 --> 12:56.401
I know where Sadie is, not here.

12:56.608 --> 12:58.722
This graduation sucks ass.

12:59.009 --> 13:01.029
The ass bench was a real omen.

13:07.317 --> 13:10.586
Little bitch is here for
your moody brat convention.

13:10.588 --> 13:12.388
Ugh, Hamiltroll, really?

13:12.390 --> 13:13.665
I told Matty to walk.

13:13.690 --> 13:16.491
He won't listen to me. Now,
get the [bleep] out of my room.

13:16.493 --> 13:17.492
Actually, Sadie, I'm here because

13:17.494 --> 13:18.827
I want you at graduation,

13:18.829 --> 13:21.314
so snap out of it and
stop being such a pussy.

13:21.339 --> 13:22.965
I can't go.

13:22.967 --> 13:25.467
Val banished me, remember?

13:25.469 --> 13:27.169
I don't really care, anyway.

13:27.171 --> 13:30.739
Bull[bleep], you care a lot,
and you know what? I do too.

13:30.741 --> 13:33.541
High school has been a huge
part of making me who I am,

13:33.543 --> 13:36.211
and in a perverse way so have you.

13:36.213 --> 13:37.579
You know what's perverse?

13:37.581 --> 13:39.381
You thinking I give a [bleep] who you are.

13:39.383 --> 13:42.250
Sadie, I know you told Matty
he should come find me at prom.

13:42.252 --> 13:46.154
Yeah, well, even if it means
indulging his sick fetish

13:46.156 --> 13:47.355
for tragic little slunts,

13:47.357 --> 13:48.790
I want him to be happy.

13:48.792 --> 13:52.376
I am ignoring that insult and thanking you.

13:52.763 --> 13:56.598
Thank you for forcing me to
stick up for myself every day

13:56.600 --> 13:58.543
for the last four years.

13:59.035 --> 14:00.602
You made me stronger.

14:00.604 --> 14:01.903
You've been a part of my life,

14:01.905 --> 14:03.228
and you're a part of our class,

14:03.253 --> 14:05.774
which is why I want you there to celebrate,

14:05.776 --> 14:07.842
and after today you'll
never have to see me again.

14:07.844 --> 14:09.977
This is the start of real life,

14:09.979 --> 14:11.780
and I would have expected the person

14:11.782 --> 14:15.817
who was so relentless about
torturing me for four years

14:15.819 --> 14:18.978
to try a little harder
to make her voice heard.

14:20.588 --> 14:22.556
Jesus, are you done?

14:22.558 --> 14:25.114
Now get the [bleep] out of my room!

14:33.103 --> 14:34.769
I'd tried everything I could think of

14:34.771 --> 14:37.197
to get Matty to walk and to
get Sadie to put up a fight,

14:37.205 --> 14:38.345
and I'd failed.

14:38.379 --> 14:41.478
Walking without them sucked,
but I still had to do it.

14:41.689 --> 14:44.582
High school was over once and for all.

14:46.455 --> 14:48.089
Here's senior class president

14:48.091 --> 14:50.692
Tamara Kaplan to present the class gift.

14:55.332 --> 14:56.798
Thank you.

14:56.800 --> 15:00.001
To make sure this school never
forgets the Class of 2015,

15:00.003 --> 15:01.635
we're giving this lovely bench

15:01.637 --> 15:04.739
to be placed on the
campus quad forevs and evs.

15:07.242 --> 15:08.309
It reads,

15:08.311 --> 15:09.811
"Rest your weary bones here

15:09.813 --> 15:13.447
and reflect on the ass of 2015 ""

15:13.449 --> 15:16.184
Yes, people, that's right, "ass."

15:16.186 --> 15:20.754
Learning and growing happen
by making mistakes and by, yes,

15:20.756 --> 15:22.322
falling on your you-know-what.

15:23.759 --> 15:25.558
Sometimes those mistakes

15:25.560 --> 15:28.398
can lead to the most
wonderful things of all.

15:28.423 --> 15:30.555
Are you with me, ass of '15?

15:30.580 --> 15:33.650
Because together, we make this ass whole.

15:40.697 --> 15:42.564
Oh, my God, what are you doing here?

15:42.566 --> 15:45.600
Hey, wow, that was deep,
Tamara. Okay, let's...

15:45.602 --> 15:47.302
Sadie said I wasn't going
to want to miss this, so...

15:47.304 --> 15:51.172
- Miss what?
- Hello, this is Sadie Saxton,

15:51.174 --> 15:54.175
your rightful valedictorian
and graduation speaker,

15:54.177 --> 15:57.178
coming to you from an undisclosed location.

15:57.180 --> 16:00.381
- Oh, right there.
- This ceremony is a travesty,

16:00.383 --> 16:03.484
but the biggest travesty
of all would be not getting

16:03.486 --> 16:06.539
to hear my speech, so here it comes.

16:06.564 --> 16:09.224
We've all spent four years at this school,

16:09.226 --> 16:12.984
years some say will be the
most formative of our lives.

16:13.009 --> 16:16.097
Every disappointment could
seem like the end of the world,

16:16.099 --> 16:19.699
and conversely, every victory
felt like an ascension.

16:19.701 --> 16:21.401
I even learned some stuff,

16:21.403 --> 16:24.371
like the fact that you can get
a really good idea from someone

16:24.373 --> 16:27.307
that you thought was just
a moronic, pathetic loser.

16:27.309 --> 16:28.876
But guess what?

16:28.878 --> 16:31.879
We're going to be all
over the country next year

16:31.881 --> 16:33.580
at different colleges,

16:33.582 --> 16:37.817
and this high school nonsense
will just be a distant memory,

16:38.153 --> 16:38.986
forgotten.

16:41.489 --> 16:42.672
Let's go.

16:43.491 --> 16:46.158
Literally, I am forgetting
about it right now.

16:46.160 --> 16:48.194
I don't want to clutter
my brain with this crap

16:48.196 --> 16:50.629
because none of this matters.

16:51.732 --> 16:53.732
I lost cheer captain this year

16:53.734 --> 16:57.503
and was devastated for, like, a minute,

16:57.505 --> 17:01.373
and then I realized no one
in college will know or care,

17:01.375 --> 17:02.808
and if they ask, guess what?

17:02.810 --> 17:05.076
I can just say I was cheer captain.

17:05.078 --> 17:06.645
Anyone can say whatever the hell

17:06.646 --> 17:08.280
they want to say about high school.

17:08.281 --> 17:11.348
We can all be the tellers
of our own stories.

17:13.721 --> 17:16.354
This is good news for those of you

17:16.356 --> 17:18.924
who aspire to something other than robotic,

17:18.925 --> 17:21.692
bougie, suburban mediocrity,

17:21.694 --> 17:23.728
and for those of you sad losers

17:23.730 --> 17:25.695
who actually peaked in high school, well,

17:25.698 --> 17:28.833
you have about ten minutes
left, so soak it up, bitches!

17:31.638 --> 17:35.141
Know this: life isn't fair.

17:35.166 --> 17:36.733
It's not a meritocracy,

17:36.735 --> 17:40.669
so do not rely on fairness
or luck or charity.

17:40.671 --> 17:43.105
You have to rely on yourself.

17:45.843 --> 17:49.177
Be the hero of your own goddamn story,

17:49.179 --> 17:50.746
because if you're not,

17:50.748 --> 17:54.249
you will end up locked
out of your own graduation

17:54.251 --> 17:58.152
and locked into a sad,
pathetic, little life.

17:59.522 --> 18:00.655
Got it?

18:00.657 --> 18:04.324
It's up to you to write your own story!

18:08.731 --> 18:10.230
You're welcome!

18:17.038 --> 18:19.338
You know what really doesn't matter, Sadie?

18:19.340 --> 18:21.274
You, 'cause this was just the warm-up

18:21.276 --> 18:24.044
to the main event, so fine,

18:24.046 --> 18:25.712
get your stupid diploma and sit down.

18:25.714 --> 18:27.013
Just don't ruin my big day, okay?

18:27.015 --> 18:28.080
Okay.

18:28.105 --> 18:29.056
Go.

18:33.889 --> 18:35.521
Theo Abbott.

18:37.925 --> 18:39.191
Kyle Cohen.

18:40.594 --> 18:41.994
Jenna Hamilton.

18:47.400 --> 18:48.767
Cole Higgins.

18:50.171 --> 18:51.170
Didn't think it would happen.

18:51.172 --> 18:53.739
Oh, that's... no.

18:53.741 --> 18:56.008
Okay. Tamara Kaplan.

18:57.944 --> 18:59.644
Matty McKibben.

19:02.282 --> 19:04.782
- Lissa Miller.
- Here you go.

19:05.585 --> 19:07.085
Jake Rosati.

19:12.459 --> 19:13.758
Sadie Saxton.

19:17.263 --> 19:21.599
Congratulations to the
Palos Hills Class of 2015!

19:29.307 --> 19:31.308
I can't believe it's over.

19:31.310 --> 19:33.310
Look, you know, just because
we aren't in school together

19:33.312 --> 19:35.511
every day, it doesn't
mean it's the end of us.

19:35.513 --> 19:38.381
I know, but at least we
have all summer, right?

19:38.383 --> 19:40.916
Jenna, I need to tell you something.

19:40.918 --> 19:43.933
This was it. High school was over.

19:45.022 --> 19:46.322
This isn't over!

19:46.324 --> 19:48.023
Nobody move!

19:50.561 --> 19:51.927
Everyone, sit down!

19:51.929 --> 19:53.328
That was just the warm up.

19:53.330 --> 19:56.998
The real ceremony is about to begin.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.568
Look, I didn't want to
say anything before, but...

19:59.570 --> 20:00.775
But what?

20:00.800 --> 20:03.556
I now pronounce this graduation...

20:04.007 --> 20:05.874
a wed-uation.

20:09.078 --> 20:11.980
My soccer training starts
the day after tomorrow,

20:15.017 --> 20:18.240
so I have to head up to
Berkeley right after grad night.

20:18.267 --> 20:20.130
Oh, my God.

20:20.923 --> 20:22.623
You mean we only have one more day left?

20:22.625 --> 20:25.019
I am so, so sorry, Jenna.

20:28.517 --> 20:30.517
