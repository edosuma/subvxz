Magnetism like this
can cause hallucinations,

16:12.472 --> 16:15.305
seizures, unconsciousness,
even death.

16:15.475 --> 16:18.182
- You're saying my mom's gonna die?
REBECCA: Her Vitals are stable.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.681
The pulses subside,
she should be fine.

16:20.855 --> 16:23.016
- Should be?
- Norrie, we are gonna figure this out.

16:24.192 --> 16:26.979
- You're sure we're safe here?
- For now.

16:27.153 --> 16:29.485
The pulses are strongest
near the dome's perimeter,

16:29.655 --> 16:32.522
so the center of town
is the zone of least destruction.

16:32.700 --> 16:35.737
Okay. All right.
So we got to move everyone.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.236
To right here,

16:38.664 --> 16:40.950
where we are at the school.

16:41.542 --> 16:44.204
The dome's altered the magnetic fields
around Chester's Mill before,

16:44.378 --> 16:46.414
when the monarch butterflies
were attracted to it,

16:46.589 --> 16:48.295
but never to this extent.

16:48.466 --> 16:52.926
If the pulses keep getting stronger,
they could tear apart the entire town.

16:53.095 --> 16:55.381
We need a way to negate the dome's
magnetic field.

16:55.556 --> 16:57.797
Joe, remember
that experiment we did

16:57.975 --> 16:59.806
when we wrapped
the copper wire around nails?

16:59.977 --> 17:01.478
A homemade magnet.

17:01.646 --> 17:03.352
If we build a really huge one
and connect it

17:03.523 --> 17:04.729
to a big enough power supply...

17:04.899 --> 17:07.015
It might be able to counteract
the dome's pulses.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.900
- Right.
- You'll need a massive conductor.

17:10.071 --> 17:11.151
Something iron or steel.

17:12.198 --> 17:14.359
And plenty of copper wire.

17:14.825 --> 17:16.326
Hey.

17:17.578 --> 17:20.570
Do you really think that this
is gonna work, a giant magnet?

17:21.666 --> 17:22.951
Well, you got something better?

17:23.709 --> 17:25.415
The dome showed a vision
to the four hands.

17:25.586 --> 17:27.292
It showed us Big Jim's death.

17:27.463 --> 17:29.795
But we didn't kill him
and the dome reacted.

17:29.966 --> 17:31.081
Badly.

17:31.259 --> 17:33.045
The dome wants Jim dead.

17:33.219 --> 17:35.426
And I don't think this is gonna stop
until that happens.

17:35.596 --> 17:38.008
I hate Big Jim as much as you do.

17:38.182 --> 17:39.763
But taking another man's life,

17:40.393 --> 17:41.724

can stay here and we'll go.

- You've got a nice touch.
- So do you.

18:27.231 --> 18:30.723
Not everyone would've jumped
into the water the way you did.

18:31.235 --> 18:33.567

18:42.455 --> 18:44.537

18:44.707 --> 18:47.619

and now I'm not sure that I did.

I wanted to let you know
that my home is your home.

35:58.114 --> 35:59.650
It might get a little cozy, but, uh...

36:00.075 --> 36:01.155
Wait, what?

36:01.326 --> 36:02.566
Come live with you?

36:02.911 --> 36:05.527
Well, at least it's a, uh,
roof over your heads.

36:07.540 --> 36:10.077
Well, that's really generous
of you, Jim.

36:10.251 --> 36:11.957
Thank you.

36:12.253 --> 36:14.414
Just make yourself at home.

36:14.631 --> 36:16.496
See you at supper. Heh.

36:19.052 --> 36:21.008
Did that magnet
mess with your brain?

36:22.138 --> 36:25.346
You keep your friends close
and your enemies closer.

36:25.517 --> 36:27.633
Trust me, Eleanor.

36:27.811 --> 36:29.267
My brain's fine.

36:30.105 --> 36:32.687
Ah, ah! Mr. Rennie. Hi.
Um, do you have a second?

36:32.857 --> 36:34.313
As many as you like, Ms. Pine.

36:34.484 --> 36:37.521
My wife always said you were
her best student. Today I learned why.

36:38.279 --> 36:40.019
The fire tower magnet
got us through the day.

36:40.198 --> 36:42.814
But I'm not gonna sleep tonight.
Neither should you.

36:43.493 --> 36:46.030
Well, I think both of us
need some sleep tonight.

36:46.413 --> 36:48.654
Those surges
fried most of our power sources.

36:48.832 --> 36:51.744
Who knows what damage they caused?
I've got to survey our water supply,

36:51.918 --> 36:53.454
find another source of power--

36:53.628 --> 36:56.335
All right, look, uh, sunrise, new eyes.

36:56.715 --> 37:00.708
What do you say we figure this out
over breakfast tomorrow morning?

37:01.344 --> 37:02.424
All right.

37:02.595 --> 37:04.506
- Yeah.
- Great.

37:12.480 --> 37:13.515
Coffee?

37:14.524 --> 37:15.934
Thanks.

37:20.822 --> 37:23.438
I think I'll, uh, just go sit down.

37:23.616 --> 37:27.029
You know, it was a good thing that I
wasn't up on those gallows with you.

37:27.203 --> 37:29.159
Because I'd have kicked
that trap door and danced

37:29.330 --> 37:30.786
while you hung
at the end of the rope.

37:31.875 --> 37:35.367
- Listen, Angie. This all happened for--
- No, get off of me.

37:37.213 --> 37:38.828
I'm sorry.

37:39.174 --> 37:40.914
Go to hell.

37:50.560 --> 37:52.221
What was that?

37:53.772 --> 37:55.137
You had my back today.

37:55.482 --> 37:57.347
Do you still have it?

37:57.525 --> 37:58.856
Of course I do.

38:04.866 --> 38:05.901
Who's that?

38:08.578 --> 38:10.489
My uncle.

38:16.085 --> 38:18.076
Kid. You got big.

38:19.380 --> 38:21.245
You want to sit down?

38:24.135 --> 38:25.921
No, thanks.

38:29.057 --> 38:30.217
Long dark hair, tall?

38:30.391 --> 38:32.768
Yeah, that sounds like a girl
I saw down the street earlier.

38:32.936 --> 38:34.221
But I didn't recognize her.

38:34.395 --> 38:36.556
- Which way did she go?
- Toward the old Food Mart.

38:37.190 --> 38:40.227
- You want some help?
- I got it.

38:40.652 --> 38:42.062
I'll see you, Junior.

38:45.532 --> 38:46.567
JULIA:
Barbie, pull over.

38:48.785 --> 38:50.525
I'll be right back.

38:50.912 --> 38:51.947
Sam?

38:53.623 --> 38:56.160
- Hey.
- How's the girl?

38:56.793 --> 38:58.203
She's gone.

38:58.378 --> 39:01.211
I searched the woods around my
cabin. I've been looking all over town.

39:01.381 --> 39:04.088
- She was in bad shape.
- I know, I'm sorry.

39:04.259 --> 39:05.999
She couldn't have gone far,
we'll find her.

39:06.427 --> 39:07.837
You look flushed. You okay?

39:10.056 --> 39:12.092
Yeah, I'm fine.

39:12.976 --> 39:14.967
Everything all right over here?

39:15.520 --> 39:17.351
Barbie, this is Sam Verdreaux.

39:17.522 --> 39:19.262
Sam, Dale Barbara.

39:19.774 --> 39:21.105
Nice work on those stitches.

39:23.611 --> 39:25.567
Glad to see that you made it.

39:25.738 --> 39:27.148
You take good care.

39:27.323 --> 39:30.531
Last time I saw Sam
was Mom's funeral.

39:31.077 --> 39:32.487
Showing up just the way he did now.

39:33.288 --> 39:35.825
Well, you never can tell with him.

39:36.207 --> 39:39.495
Sam's been out of his head
for quite a while now.

39:40.169 --> 39:42.706
I don't think it's a coincidence.

39:43.214 --> 39:44.954
- When I passed out earlier--
- Son?

39:45.842 --> 39:48.003
What happened today...

39:48.887 --> 39:52.175
I'm sorry I dismissed
what you had to say.

39:53.224 --> 39:54.339
Maybe you're right.

39:54.809 --> 39:56.925
- About the dome?
- Yes.

39:57.812 --> 39:59.143
Then listen to me.

39:59.314 --> 40:03.227
When I passed out earlier,
it was like I went somewhere.

40:04.360 --> 40:05.520
And I saw Mom.

40:07.655 --> 40:09.862
She talked to me.

40:10.241 --> 40:12.778
And then my Uncle Sam
comes walking through the front door?

40:12.952 --> 40:15.364
We all saw things today.

40:15.997 --> 40:18.329
Just because you dreamed about
her doesn't mean she's alive.

40:18.499 --> 40:21.115
No, no. This wasn't a dream.
This was real.

40:21.294 --> 40:22.875
- Junior--
- Don't call me that.

40:25.798 --> 40:28.050
My name is James.

40:33.556 --> 40:35.296
James.

41:06.798 --> 41:08.709
MAN [ON TV]: Breaking news
on the mysterious dome

41:08.883 --> 41:11.340
that descended over the town
of Chester's Mill.

41:11.511 --> 41:13.126
There has still been
no official statement

41:13.304 --> 41:15.590
on reported
abnormal magnetic activity,

41:15.765 --> 41:19.257
or why the temporarily opaque dome
suddenly cleared.

41:19.435 --> 41:21.471
The world remains fascinated
by the dome

41:21.646 --> 41:24.683
and concerned
for those still trapped inside.

41:39.580 --> 41:40.740
Hello?

42:15.825 --> 42:16.905
Are you okay?

42:25.960 --> 42:28.827
No,no,no.
No. I'm not gonna hurt you.

42:49.442 --> 42:51.148
