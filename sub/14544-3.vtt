02:38.805 --> 02:39.749
Hello.

03:10.960 --> 03:14.480
PROVING LOVE

04:28.248 --> 04:31.354
- Yes, Emma...
- Wiik, that's me!

04:31.451 --> 04:34.330
- And Bruce...
- Evans, that's him. Hello.

04:34.421 --> 04:36.423
- Hello, welcome.
- Thanks.

04:42.162 --> 04:43.664
We love each other.

04:45.332 --> 04:46.333
Great.

04:48.168 --> 04:51.047
We'll start with some details.

04:51.138 --> 04:53.084
Absolutely, hit me!

04:53.173 --> 04:55.983
Right, I will. Name?

04:56.076 --> 04:58.056
Maria Greta Kristina Emma Wiik.

04:58.145 --> 04:59.453
W-I-I-K.

05:01.615 --> 05:03.356
You can put "brown" there.

05:04.818 --> 05:08.129
- Sorry?
- Brown is Bruce's favorite color.

05:08.221 --> 05:09.894
You were gonna ask about that, right?

05:09.990 --> 05:13.403
- Oh, okay.
- Not mine! God, no, I don't like brown.

05:13.493 --> 05:16.269
I don't consider that a color,
you know.

05:16.363 --> 05:18.639
It's like a mix of all colors.

05:18.732 --> 05:21.679
Okay... good.

05:21.768 --> 05:24.374
Maybe I should tell you
how we do this interview.

05:24.471 --> 05:26.542
You don't have to, I know how!

05:26.640 --> 05:32.181
The point is, I should get
an understanding of...

05:32.279 --> 05:34.122
Our relationship, I know.

05:34.214 --> 05:37.991
Right, so nothing is unclear.

05:38.084 --> 05:39.927
No, no, nothing is unclear at all.

05:40.020 --> 05:41.658
We love each other.
We're a couple. Nothing is unclear.

05:41.755 --> 05:45.225
- If you could try finishing my...
- ...sentences.

05:45.325 --> 05:47.771
Sorry. Absolutely.

05:49.462 --> 05:52.102
This is not a competition.

05:52.199 --> 05:53.644
No, I know.

05:53.733 --> 05:56.737
But if it was,
I would be doing good, right?

07:46.046 --> 07:48.390
You just need to nod

07:48.481 --> 07:54.898
when I'm asking you
if you don't know the man in here?

08:01.561 --> 08:07.170
Okay, so you are not under
any kind of threat?

08:20.080 --> 08:21.354
Okay, good.

12:34.701 --> 12:36.510
Is that really the words?

12:44.777 --> 12:46.882
Oh, my.

12:46.980 --> 12:48.823
Exactly, that's how we live right now.

12:56.122 --> 12:57.362
Mom, look!

12:57.457 --> 12:59.630
It's very mixed.

13:00.727 --> 13:03.207
It's a little bit of you
and a little bit of, well...

13:03.296 --> 13:05.401
- Do you want to know what I think?
- No, I really don't.

13:05.498 --> 13:07.444
- Coffee, anyone?
- Please.

13:32.825 --> 13:34.862
Shouldn't we just try
to have a nice time?

13:34.961 --> 13:36.201
I was just saying...

14:29.582 --> 14:30.959
Mom, that's enough.

14:49.602 --> 14:51.809
But, Viveka, you are a therapist.

14:58.277 --> 14:59.381
Do you understand me?

15:23.002 --> 15:24.572
Mom!

15:26.773 --> 15:29.481
I'm stuck! Mom! Birger!

15:30.243 --> 15:33.053
Oh, honey!
Birger, go help him!

18:41.200 --> 18:43.476
Well, when we feel insecure,

18:43.569 --> 18:47.574
we always do
these unannounced visits.

18:47.673 --> 18:49.880
Oh, well, but we do live here.

18:50.943 --> 18:52.354
Okay.

18:52.445 --> 18:53.719
Without furniture?

18:53.813 --> 18:59.764
No, we got rid of them.

18:59.852 --> 19:01.024
That's not totally common.

19:01.120 --> 19:06.126
No, but it's not totally unromantic
to start over from scratch.

19:06.225 --> 19:09.604
No, of course, it's not.

19:11.364 --> 19:13.742
Hello, can you help me?

19:15.501 --> 19:17.344
But I'm stuck.

19:19.972 --> 19:23.545
- And where is...?
- Bruce is not here now.

19:23.643 --> 19:30.060
He's taking the furniture away.

19:30.149 --> 19:32.595
Okay, you know what,
to me this sounds like...

19:32.685 --> 19:33.527
Here he is!
