00:08.560 --> 00:10.260
What are you guys doing?

00:10.290 --> 00:14.890
I gave Principal Skidmore a hairpin
that's actually a wireless webcam.

00:20.960 --> 00:23.060
What are you smiling about?
This is a school!

00:26.930 --> 00:28.860
We can see everything she sees?

00:28.900 --> 00:30.800
As long as she's in range of the receiver.

00:30.830 --> 00:33.070
Which pretty much covers
any place in the school.

00:48.110 --> 00:49.910
What's Skidmore looking at now?

00:49.950 --> 00:51.980
Oh. She's looking
at a group of kids.

00:52.020 --> 00:55.050
And it looks like they're
watching something on a monitor.

00:56.150 --> 00:57.820
Uh-oh.

01:00.260 --> 01:03.890
Chyna! You gave me this!

01:03.930 --> 01:06.800
This is what you rotten
kids use the Internet for?

01:06.830 --> 01:08.200
No. We also use it
for online shopping.

01:08.230 --> 01:11.040
Isn't that where you bought the webcam?

01:11.070 --> 01:13.840
Webcam?

01:13.870 --> 01:15.910
It has a webcam?

01:15.940 --> 01:19.180
I just got you this
because it's cute. See?

01:20.080 --> 01:21.250
That's it!

01:21.280 --> 01:24.920
I am turning off Internet
access in this school,

01:24.950 --> 01:26.120
effective immediately!

01:27.990 --> 01:30.020
And you have Chyna to thank!

02:42.920 --> 02:47.120
Wow. People are really angry at me
about this whole Internet thing.

02:47.160 --> 02:49.930
I think I got rebooted a couple of times.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.100
Well, at least you guys don't blame me.

02:55.130 --> 02:56.830
You destroyed what I love.

02:56.870 --> 02:59.900
Now I'm going to destroy what you love.

03:05.880 --> 03:09.150
I don't understand
why everyone is so upset.

03:09.180 --> 03:12.050
We can still with our cell phones.

03:12.080 --> 03:14.980
No, we can't.
Our cell phones.

03:15.020 --> 03:16.750
You're lucky.

03:16.790 --> 03:19.030
She peanut-buttered mine.

03:22.430 --> 03:25.030
Well, back when we had the Internet,

03:25.060 --> 03:28.770
I read online that without the Internet.

03:29.970 --> 03:31.940
Like, we could

03:31.970 --> 03:34.910
go to that park across the
street and fly a kite.

03:34.940 --> 03:36.970
How are we supposed to find
our way across the street

03:37.010 --> 03:40.110
without looking up directions online?

03:40.150 --> 03:43.180
How do you think people crossed the
road before there was an Internet?

03:43.220 --> 03:45.780
They followed the chicken?

03:46.290 --> 03:48.090
Wait!

03:48.120 --> 03:50.190
How are we supposed to do our
schoolwork without the Internet?

03:50.220 --> 03:52.220
I have a paper due this afternoon.

03:52.260 --> 03:54.090
Why don't you guys just use the library?

03:55.130 --> 03:56.930
We have a library?

04:03.870 --> 04:05.200
Okay. Seriously, people?

04:05.240 --> 04:06.900
Just because the Internet is out,

04:06.940 --> 04:10.010
there's no reason to resort to violence.

04:10.040 --> 04:13.080
Actually, this is just what people
are using now instead of email.

04:17.050 --> 04:18.180
L.O.L.

04:27.120 --> 04:29.790
Lexi, you get Internet out here?

04:29.820 --> 04:31.220
What? No.

04:31.260 --> 04:32.990
I only have this laptop to
use the webcam as a mirror.

04:36.030 --> 04:38.100
Well, I better get to class.

04:38.130 --> 04:41.030
Okay, I'll see you later, honey.
I'll miss you.

04:42.100 --> 04:43.840
Wait.

04:43.870 --> 04:46.800
Cameron? Remember your
invisible girlfriend?

04:48.110 --> 04:50.110
I think I'm seeing her now.

04:51.940 --> 04:54.010
Lexi, this is Vanessa.

04:54.050 --> 04:56.050
My actual girlfriend.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.880
My actual girlfriend.

05:01.950 --> 05:04.950
Is he holding you against your will?
Are you in danger?

05:04.990 --> 05:07.960
Blink twice if you want me
to call the authorities.

05:07.990 --> 05:10.890
I'll see you after school, sweetie.

05:12.930 --> 05:15.000
This is very upsetting.

05:15.030 --> 05:17.800
If a girl like that can end
up with someone like you,

05:17.830 --> 05:19.000
I could end up with

05:19.030 --> 05:22.800
someone only slightly
more attractive than you!

05:22.840 --> 05:25.740
I'm telling you.
There must be something wrong with her.

05:25.770 --> 05:29.840
Just accept it.
She finds me irresistible.

05:29.880 --> 05:31.080
Look at yourself.

05:32.980 --> 05:34.750
You're resistible.

05:36.080 --> 05:37.920
I'm telling you,

05:37.950 --> 05:41.190
there must be some other reason
she's interested in you.

05:41.220 --> 05:45.160
Maybe she's a vampire with
a thirst for human blood.

05:45.190 --> 05:47.960
No, she babysits.

05:47.990 --> 05:51.000
Why would anyone hire a
babysitter who's a vampire?

05:52.130 --> 05:53.900
Maybe Vanessa's an alien!

05:53.930 --> 05:56.870
And her species is here to take
over the bodies of humans.

05:56.900 --> 05:59.840
Naturally, it's easier to take
control of someone weak-minded.

05:59.870 --> 06:02.140
Someone without a real personality.
An empty shell!

06:03.140 --> 06:04.240
Yeah. Like that.

06:17.890 --> 06:19.960
Well, the library does exist.

06:22.760 --> 06:25.960
I don't understand.
How do you find what you need in here?

06:26.000 --> 06:27.900
You just ask the librarian for help.

06:29.100 --> 06:30.900
Excuse me, Miss.
We really need...

06:35.170 --> 06:38.870
This is a library.

06:38.910 --> 06:41.110
Don't freak out.
Librarians always look better

06:41.140 --> 06:43.740
when they take off their glasses
and let down their hair.

06:51.090 --> 06:53.020
See? Cute, huh?

06:56.090 --> 06:59.930
Excuse me, headless skinny lady.

06:59.960 --> 07:03.000
I need to get some information on
penguins for my science assignment.

07:03.030 --> 07:04.800
You came to the right place.

07:04.830 --> 07:07.030
Libraries aren't just filled
with dust and corpses.

07:07.070 --> 07:10.000
They're also filled with all
kinds of valuable information!

07:11.740 --> 07:12.910
She is right.

07:12.940 --> 07:14.870
Here, Paisley, use this.

07:14.910 --> 07:16.040
Thanks!

07:18.810 --> 07:20.980
None of these apps are working.

07:21.010 --> 07:25.050
Thanks, Chyna.
Now I'll never know what a penguin is.

07:25.090 --> 07:27.190
Penguins are a group of
aquatic, flightless birds

07:27.220 --> 07:29.720
that are members of
the Spheniscidae family,

07:29.760 --> 07:32.060
native to the southern hemisphere,
especially Antarctica.

07:36.930 --> 07:40.030
Of course!
Anything you need from the Internet,

07:40.070 --> 07:41.730
you can get from us!

07:42.030 --> 07:43.030
Information,

07:43.830 --> 07:45.030
images,

07:45.070 --> 07:48.070
music, and funny videos!

07:48.100 --> 07:51.100
We'll be the ANTernet!

07:52.910 --> 07:56.080
Good, because I'm getting tired
of sending email by brick.

08:00.880 --> 08:03.180
I hate when people
use "reply all."

08:05.680 --> 08:06.680
Hey!

08:07.420 --> 08:08.380
Hey!

08:08.680 --> 08:10.490
Hey! Hey!

08:12.290 --> 08:14.420
Privet!

08:14.460 --> 08:16.490
Welcome to Hippo's House of Borscht.

08:16.530 --> 08:19.460
Where we're rushin' to serve you.

08:19.500 --> 08:22.300
Although not really.
I get winded easily.

08:23.730 --> 08:25.430
This is your new theme?

08:25.470 --> 08:27.300
Russia's really in right now?

08:27.340 --> 08:30.410
I don't know. Usually I look
online to find out what's in,

08:30.440 --> 08:32.640
but since I "borrow"
wi-fi from the school,

08:32.679 --> 08:35.280
this was just a shot in the dark.

08:35.309 --> 08:37.549
Your server today will be Alexi.

08:42.530 --> 08:44.430
Take good care of them, dollface.

08:49.330 --> 08:52.600
Here's something I never thought
I'd say to you, Cameron.

08:54.370 --> 08:55.440
Table for two?

09:01.410 --> 09:03.710
I just wanted you to know, you were wrong.

09:03.750 --> 09:06.350
I have proof Vanessa is not an alien.

09:06.380 --> 09:08.320
She rode here in the basket of my bike

09:08.350 --> 09:10.520
and not once did we leave the ground.

09:12.360 --> 09:14.660
Whatever.
I have my own problems,

09:14.700 --> 09:18.230
like having to wear this
stupid, uncomfortable costume.

09:24.710 --> 09:26.470
That's better.

09:31.380 --> 09:33.720
Good question.
I love Slovakia!

09:33.750 --> 09:36.250
It boasts beautiful mountains with.

09:36.290 --> 09:41.320
Gerlachovsky stit being its
highest peak at 2,655 metres.

09:41.360 --> 09:43.490
Wait, you're the geography teacher.
Shouldn't you know this?

09:45.730 --> 09:48.500
Here you go.
A picture of a hot chick.

09:55.470 --> 09:57.640
Ouch! Ouch Charlie!

10:00.710 --> 10:03.380
Charlie bit me,

10:03.410 --> 10:05.750
and that really hurt, Charlie.

10:08.650 --> 10:11.290
I also do music downloads.

10:12.420 --> 10:14.290
<i>♪ So you didn't show up</i>

10:14.330 --> 10:15.690
<i>♪ My heart didn't blow up</i>

10:15.730 --> 10:19.730
<i>♪ I ain't gonna</i>
<i>lose it all tonight ♪</i>

10:19.770 --> 10:23.440
See? Isn't this better than
getting your music from piracy?

10:28.410 --> 10:29.710
<i>♪ So ya didn't show up</i>

10:29.750 --> 10:32.480
<i>♪ My heart didn't blow up</i>

10:32.520 --> 10:35.750
<i>♪ I ain't gonna</i>
<i>lose it all tonight ♪</i>

10:35.780 --> 10:37.420
I have a question.

10:37.450 --> 10:39.420
Sure. What would
you like to know?

10:39.460 --> 10:41.360
Why are my parents always fighting?

10:41.390 --> 10:42.520
That's an easy one.

10:42.560 --> 10:44.390
According to statistical research,

10:44.430 --> 10:45.790
the vast majority of conflict among couples

10:45.830 --> 10:47.660
is caused by financial stress,

10:47.700 --> 10:50.430
communication issues, or lack
of quality time together.

10:50.470 --> 10:51.470
Next!

10:58.540 --> 11:01.440
Olive! Paisley has
a real problem,

11:01.480 --> 11:04.780
and she needs emotional
support, not cold hard facts.

11:04.810 --> 11:07.280
But that's what the Internet
would have told her.

11:07.310 --> 11:08.680
Well, we're not computers.

11:08.710 --> 11:10.370
We're human.

11:11.310 --> 11:12.570
Hmm? Oh, thanks.

11:34.790 --> 11:36.590
Oh! Cute!

11:40.330 --> 11:43.470
Am I crazy, or does this
borscht taste like foot?

11:43.500 --> 11:44.700
You're crazy.

11:47.670 --> 11:49.740
I don't feel so well.

11:55.610 --> 11:57.780
I don't get why this place isn't busier.

11:57.810 --> 12:00.480
I put these on every windshield in town.

12:02.620 --> 12:06.390
Maybe you should consider
using a pretty girl

12:06.420 --> 12:08.490
instead of whatever the heck this is.

12:10.360 --> 12:12.700
A pretty girl.
Great idea!

12:12.730 --> 12:14.460
There's one over there!

12:17.470 --> 12:20.300
Hey there. I was wondering
if you might be interested

12:20.340 --> 12:22.440
in posing for some
flyers for my restaurant.

12:22.470 --> 12:25.610
Because my current flyer is getting
a somewhat mixed reaction.

12:25.640 --> 12:28.340
I love it, but everyone else hates it.

12:29.650 --> 12:32.580
I actually am a model.

12:32.620 --> 12:35.520
Awesome! Can you come by
for a photo shoot later?

12:35.750 --> 12:37.420
Sure,

12:37.450 --> 12:39.690
but you should know I'm an alien.

12:39.720 --> 12:41.560
You mean you're from up there?

12:41.590 --> 12:43.760
Yeah. Canada.

12:43.800 --> 12:47.730
Since I'm from another country,
do I need a work permit?

12:47.770 --> 12:49.430
Work permit?

12:49.470 --> 12:51.570
I don't even have a restaurant license.

12:54.470 --> 12:56.670
Just show up here tonight
at six with your makeup on.

13:01.380 --> 13:03.580
Hi, Mom!
Having fun on your cruise?

13:04.750 --> 13:07.520
Things are going really well down here.

13:07.550 --> 13:09.490
I just got a new assignment.

13:09.520 --> 13:12.260
No, it doesn't matter that I'm an alien.

13:13.660 --> 13:16.260
All I have to do is
show up with my face on.

13:18.360 --> 13:19.730
Oh, Cameron, I didn't see you there.

13:19.760 --> 13:21.500
I was just calling my mother's ship.

13:28.510 --> 13:29.570
Paisley?

13:30.510 --> 13:31.740
Paisley?

13:31.780 --> 13:33.710
Are you in here?

13:33.740 --> 13:36.680
No. Go away.

13:36.710 --> 13:38.550
Well, she's not
in here. Let's go.

13:40.350 --> 13:41.720
No.

13:41.750 --> 13:45.320
We need to help her.
She needs a shoulder to cry on.

13:45.360 --> 13:46.590
Here.

13:48.590 --> 13:49.660
Olive.

13:51.530 --> 13:54.400
Paisley, are you okay?

13:54.430 --> 13:56.400
Is there anything I can do?

13:56.430 --> 13:58.500
There's lots of things you can do,

13:58.540 --> 14:01.470
play instruments,
write songs, make friends.

14:02.570 --> 14:04.640
Wait, why am I cheering you up?

14:06.550 --> 14:09.480
I don't think I'll ever stop crying.

14:09.510 --> 14:11.550
Oh, sure you will.

14:11.580 --> 14:14.390
Tears are mostly water, so you'll
eventually become dehydrated,

14:14.420 --> 14:16.450
which, if untreated,
can result in delirium,

14:16.490 --> 14:18.320
unconsciousness, swelling of the tongue

14:18.360 --> 14:19.560
and in extreme cases, death.

14:24.530 --> 14:27.500
Olive, we're supposed to
be making her feel better.

14:29.300 --> 14:32.470
Hey. You want to see a video
that always makes me smile?

14:48.320 --> 14:50.590
Paisley, all parents fight.

14:50.620 --> 14:53.590
It's a natural part of all relationships.

14:53.630 --> 14:57.330
But I love them so much and
I hate to see them unhappy.

14:57.360 --> 15:00.300
Well, I'm sure they have
some good times together.

15:00.630 --> 15:03.300
They used to.

15:03.340 --> 15:07.510
Well, why don't we throw them a romantic
dinner and rekindle their romance?

15:07.550 --> 15:10.520
That's a great idea, creepy singing man.

15:14.020 --> 15:15.430
Where did Chyna go?

15:29.100 --> 15:30.460
What are you doing in my locker?

15:31.330 --> 15:33.330
Hiding from Vanessa.

15:33.370 --> 15:36.100
You know, I thought I'd be
claustrophobic in here,

15:36.140 --> 15:38.410
but all these mirrors
really open up the room.

15:40.170 --> 15:42.180
Why are you hiding from Vanessa?

15:42.210 --> 15:44.180
I found out she is an alien.

15:44.210 --> 15:45.480
Yeah, Hippo told me.

15:45.510 --> 15:48.450
And yet he hired her as a model and not me.

15:48.480 --> 15:52.150
I should call the government and
have them come and take her away.

15:52.190 --> 15:56.060
What? No! I don't want
anything to happen to her!

15:56.090 --> 15:57.390
Even though we're
from two different worlds,

15:57.420 --> 15:59.290
our love can survive!

15:59.320 --> 16:02.460
Aw, that's amazing.

16:02.490 --> 16:03.490
Thanks, Lexi.

16:03.520 --> 16:05.360
No, I meant my complexion.

16:08.160 --> 16:10.460
Just when I thought I
couldn't get any prettier.

16:16.130 --> 16:19.060
This dinner for Paisley's
parents has to be perfect.

16:19.100 --> 16:20.400
Angus, what are you making?

16:20.430 --> 16:22.060
Chipped beef.

16:30.430 --> 16:32.030
Hi, guys.

16:33.030 --> 16:35.160
Paisley?
Where are your parents?

16:35.190 --> 16:36.460
Right here.

16:40.450 --> 16:43.120
Those are parrots.

16:43.150 --> 16:47.050
Right. My parrots.
The ones I said are always fighting.

16:48.350 --> 16:50.980
Stop nagging, you old buzzard!

16:51.490 --> 16:54.420
Shut your trap, birdbrain!

16:54.460 --> 16:56.290
I don't know why everyone
keeps talking about it.

16:56.320 --> 16:58.420
There's nothing fun about angry birds.

17:00.260 --> 17:03.130
Okay, there must have
been a misunderstanding.

17:03.160 --> 17:05.930
We thought you were bringing your parents.

17:05.970 --> 17:08.170
My parents wouldn't fit in this cage.

17:09.240 --> 17:13.109
Well, I guess we're done here.

17:13.140 --> 17:15.369
What about the romantic dinner?

17:15.410 --> 17:17.339
You promised you'd help them.

17:21.180 --> 17:24.329
Come on, guys.
Paisley really needs our help.

17:24.359 --> 17:26.329
They may just be parrots to us,

17:26.359 --> 17:28.300
but they're obviously
really important to her.

17:30.300 --> 17:34.040
Don't cry, Paisley.
We can still have the dinner.

17:34.070 --> 17:35.300
For your birds.

17:38.040 --> 17:42.010
Here you go.
Two soups with extra crackers.

17:42.050 --> 17:45.980
Keep stuffing your gizzard,
you tub of lard!

17:46.020 --> 17:48.220
At least I'm not going bald!

17:49.250 --> 17:51.290
This isn't working.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.360
Hey. You want these
birds to stop fighting?

17:53.390 --> 17:55.330
Give me five minutes alone with them.

17:55.360 --> 17:57.130
Are you going to put them in the chipper?

17:57.160 --> 17:59.370
I don't hear a better plan.

17:59.400 --> 18:02.230
Give me five minutes alone with them.

18:02.270 --> 18:04.100
I'll talk to them.

18:04.140 --> 18:07.070
Uh, I don't know, Olive.

18:07.110 --> 18:10.010
You're not always the
most sensitive person.

18:10.040 --> 18:12.950
What? I am super sensitive.

18:12.980 --> 18:15.350
Really? When Fletcher broke
his arm at his birthday party

18:15.380 --> 18:17.020
and had to go to the hospital,

18:17.050 --> 18:19.220
you just said,
"More cake for us!"

18:26.090 --> 18:30.100
Welcome to, my new restaurant,
Hippo's Petri Dish.

18:30.130 --> 18:34.000
Where we're allowed to have bacteria
in the food because it's science-y.

18:35.270 --> 18:37.300
What happened to the Russian theme?

18:37.340 --> 18:39.370
Russia is very out right now.

18:39.410 --> 18:44.010
Except in Russia, where it
remains moderately popular.

18:44.050 --> 18:47.050
Lexi! Take over while
I do the photo shoot!

18:55.130 --> 18:57.130
Lexi, why are you dressed like that?

18:57.160 --> 19:00.300
Well, I figured if one pretty
girl would bring in customers,

19:00.330 --> 19:03.200
think of what would happen
if you used one pretty girl

19:03.230 --> 19:05.400
and one even prettier girl.

19:05.440 --> 19:08.040
I like the way you think.

19:08.070 --> 19:11.270
But where am I going to find another
pretty girl on such short notice?

19:13.180 --> 19:15.380
Now go get into your
dissected frog costume.

19:20.120 --> 19:22.080
Okay, strike a pose.

19:22.420 --> 19:24.420
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

19:24.450 --> 19:27.160
All right, all right,
all right, that's great.

19:27.190 --> 19:29.090
Just act like I'm not even here.

19:31.290 --> 19:34.960
Stay still.
This'll be over before you know it.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.100
You monsters!

19:37.400 --> 19:40.140
I won't let you cut open
this poor creature!

19:40.170 --> 19:42.270
Cameron?
What are you doing?

19:42.300 --> 19:46.040
Saving you!
And destroying this torture chamber!

19:52.050 --> 19:55.050
What is this, reinforced steel?

19:59.130 --> 20:02.300
There you go, hero of Earth.

20:02.330 --> 20:05.370
Hey! This restaurant's
theme is science,

20:05.410 --> 20:09.010
not jerks that come in
and smash everything.

20:09.040 --> 20:11.180
Although that's a pretty good hook.

20:12.050 --> 20:13.180
A hook?

20:13.220 --> 20:16.320
Is that what you're going to
use to tear open her face?

20:16.350 --> 20:19.120
So what if under all that
makeup she's a beast?

20:19.160 --> 20:22.460
Where she comes from this is
probably considered hideous.

20:24.430 --> 20:26.170
Where I come from, too.

20:27.440 --> 20:30.280
Well, I won't let you cut her open!

20:30.310 --> 20:32.320
And I don't care that she's an alien!

20:32.350 --> 20:34.260
I love her!

20:34.290 --> 20:38.270
Aw. I love you, too.

20:38.300 --> 20:41.540
But I wouldn't think being from
Canada is that big a deal.

20:42.580 --> 20:44.150
Canada?

20:45.250 --> 20:46.450
You're from Canada?

20:48.490 --> 20:52.290
That gives me an idea!
A Canadian-themed restaurant!

20:52.330 --> 20:55.190
We could serve chow mein
and play backgammon.

20:57.230 --> 20:59.300
I don't really know very much about Canada.

21:05.170 --> 21:06.410
So, how did it go?

21:06.440 --> 21:08.110
Hear for yourself.

21:08.140 --> 21:11.510
You're the best!
I love you!

21:12.550 --> 21:14.280
Wow, Olive!

21:14.310 --> 21:17.420
Who would have thought five minutes
alone with you would be so amazing?

21:22.420 --> 21:24.090
Thanks, guys!

21:24.120 --> 21:25.460
You don't have to thank us.

21:25.490 --> 21:28.260
You should just thank me.
Because I did it all.

21:30.230 --> 21:33.160
Wow, Olive.
I guess I misjudged you.

21:33.200 --> 21:36.070
You really can go deeper
than just spouting facts.

21:36.100 --> 21:37.470
Interesting factoid.

21:38.470 --> 21:41.070
Parrots mimic human speech.

21:41.110 --> 21:42.410
But they have no vocal cords

21:42.440 --> 21:44.540
so sound is accomplished by expelling air

21:44.580 --> 21:47.350
across the mouth of the bifurcated trachea.

21:48.280 --> 21:49.280
Wait a minute.

21:51.450 --> 21:54.290
You just got them to
repeat things you said.

21:54.320 --> 21:55.350
That's not true.

21:55.390 --> 21:57.220
That's not true.
That's not true.

22:01.130 --> 22:02.500
You didn't resolve their issues at all.

22:02.530 --> 22:04.160
They don't have issues.

22:04.200 --> 22:05.400
They don't hate each other?

22:05.430 --> 22:07.230
No. They weren't fighting.

22:07.270 --> 22:08.500
They were just repeating nasty things

22:08.540 --> 22:10.470
they've heard other people
in your house say.

22:10.510 --> 22:13.470
My mother was right.
I'm too good for you.

22:14.410 --> 22:17.180
Uh, Paisley.

22:17.210 --> 22:19.050
I hate to tell you this,

22:19.080 --> 22:21.380
but I think your mom and
dad might be fighting.

22:21.420 --> 22:23.380
Oh yeah, they fight all the time.

22:25.190 --> 22:27.090
Get off my back, woman!

22:27.120 --> 22:28.490
Get off the couch, deadbeat!

22:30.320 --> 22:32.460
"Get off the couch, deadbeat!"

22:32.490 --> 22:34.500
That is so Mom.

22:39.540 --> 22:43.500
Everyone, I've decided to
turn the Internet back on.

22:46.280 --> 22:48.080
So what happened, Principal Skidmore?

22:48.110 --> 22:50.449
Did you finally realize that
the free flow of information

22:50.450 --> 22:51.880
is more important to society

22:51.881 --> 22:55.100
than the feelings of one old
lady in pancake makeup?

22:55.850 --> 22:59.590
No. I realized I was
missing important emails.

23:00.200 --> 23:04.349
Like the one saying the superintendent
was coming to do an inspection.

23:04.350 --> 23:07.169
By the way, if he asks,
the librarian is still alive,

23:07.170 --> 23:09.580
and they should continue
issuing her paychecks.

23:12.950 --> 23:14.709
Why is everyone so happy?

23:14.710 --> 23:16.710
This is a school.

23:17.340 --> 23:21.320
Principal Skidmark Internet back on.

23:22.200 --> 23:23.539
Thank goodness.

23:23.540 --> 23:26.940
Because I'm tired of
doing Dramatic Chipmunk.
