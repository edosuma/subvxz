01:20.282 --> 01:22.683
Oh, my god, what time is it?

01:22.818 --> 01:24.184
Julie!

01:26.688 --> 01:27.687
Jules...

01:27.690 --> 01:28.989
I was just leaving.

01:30.692 --> 01:33.193
So was I.

01:38.200 --> 01:41.568
<i>This morning,
in the San Francisco bay area,</i>

01:41.570 --> 01:43.703
<i>we currently have cloudy skies,</i>

01:43.772 --> 01:46.172
<i>with highs expected to reach
into the low 60s.</i>

01:46.208 --> 01:48.286
<i>The reason it's so much cooler
for this time of year...</i>

01:48.310 --> 01:50.843
You guys were together
for five years.

01:50.879 --> 01:51.911
I can't believe

01:51.947 --> 01:53.357
you missed your own
engagement party, man.

01:53.381 --> 01:54.648
Everybody was there.

01:54.650 --> 01:55.849
I even put on a tie.

01:55.918 --> 01:56.783
Your mother didn't recognize me.

01:56.852 --> 01:58.952
I screwed up, I know.

01:58.954 --> 01:59.919
I know.

01:59.955 --> 02:01.054
I lost track of time.

02:01.056 --> 02:02.600
There was a bug
in the new web-hosting program.

02:02.624 --> 02:03.723
It was three years
in the pipeline.

02:03.726 --> 02:05.103
And Brian Connor
was the only person

02:05.127 --> 02:06.126
that could have
done something about it.

02:06.128 --> 02:07.927
That's what they pay me for.

02:07.963 --> 02:09.863
Dude, it's
your family's company, man.

02:09.931 --> 02:11.698
I think they would
have understood.

02:12.768 --> 02:13.733
Nice shot.

02:13.736 --> 02:14.935
Plus there was always today.

02:14.937 --> 02:17.672
300,000 customers with Western
Tech wouldn't have understood.

02:17.706 --> 02:19.206
You can't marry
Western Tech, man.

02:20.342 --> 02:21.141
I was almost done.

02:21.276 --> 02:23.743
15 more minutes
was all I needed.

02:23.746 --> 02:27.146
Yeah, and you could have helped
the bus boys clear the room.

02:27.182 --> 02:28.382
I really screwed up, didn't I?

02:31.820 --> 02:32.886
I gotta go.

02:34.022 --> 02:36.089
Three games?

02:36.224 --> 02:40.160
Guess I should count myself
lucky for getting that.

02:40.162 --> 02:41.895
Hey, man, we still
on for Saturday?

02:41.964 --> 02:43.763
I've got the medical
conference in the P.M.,

02:43.832 --> 02:44.832
but my A.M.
is wide open.

02:44.900 --> 02:47.181
Yeah, about that,
you know, after last night,

02:47.302 --> 02:51.237
I think that I'm going to head East
for a while, sort things out.

02:51.306 --> 02:53.318
We picked up a little web hosting
company in Maine last month.

02:53.342 --> 02:54.775
Maine?

02:54.910 --> 02:57.243
Yeah, Seabrook,
a little town outside of Portland.

02:57.312 --> 02:59.846
Yeah, I know where it is.

02:59.882 --> 03:01.314
Give me a shout, brother.

03:01.449 --> 03:02.849
Yeah.

03:02.851 --> 03:04.818
All right, man.

04:12.354 --> 04:15.455
- Mr. Connor?
- Brian.

04:15.457 --> 04:16.322
Alana Sullivan.

04:16.458 --> 04:18.324
- Welcome to New England.
- Thanks.

04:18.360 --> 04:19.993
We weren't expecting
you this soon.

04:19.995 --> 04:21.995
Clearly.

04:21.997 --> 04:23.763
Well, your office
is right over here.

04:25.200 --> 04:27.278
Kind of hard to focus on work
when every day is casual Friday,

04:27.302 --> 04:28.801
don't you think?

04:28.871 --> 04:30.403
We haven't noticed
a problem so far.

04:33.809 --> 04:36.409
I hope the previous manager
isn't upset that I'm moving in.

04:36.478 --> 04:39.145
Nope, she's fine with it.

04:39.181 --> 04:42.282
I'll have the rest of these boxes
out of here by this afternoon.

04:42.284 --> 04:44.017
I apologize.

04:44.019 --> 04:46.086
Hey, can't afford hard feelings.

04:47.422 --> 04:48.755
I know how this probably looks.

04:48.890 --> 04:49.956
Really?
How does it look?

04:50.091 --> 04:50.891
It looks like
you lost your title

04:51.026 --> 04:52.292
because my family
owns this company.

04:52.294 --> 04:54.294
You do know how it looks.

04:54.296 --> 04:55.962
I'm only here to help.

04:56.097 --> 04:57.097
Want to have a seat?

05:03.438 --> 05:06.306
I want to get off
on the right foot here.

05:06.308 --> 05:08.174
It looks like you got
a sweet little operation.

05:08.176 --> 05:10.109
We did over 20 million
in sales last year.

05:10.145 --> 05:11.978
And Connor Tech
did over two billion.

05:12.113 --> 05:14.780
I'm not here to play
"my profit is bigger than yours".

05:14.816 --> 05:16.049
I am here to work with you,

05:16.118 --> 05:18.517
I want to make this company
a part of the Connor family,

05:18.553 --> 05:20.987
and then, I'm going to turn
the office right back over to you.

05:20.989 --> 05:23.456
So this demotion
really isn't permanent?

05:23.492 --> 05:25.058
Exactly what I'm trying to say.

05:26.394 --> 05:28.328
So...
Can we do this and move on?

05:28.330 --> 05:30.063
Absolutely.

05:30.065 --> 05:31.065
Okay, good.

05:31.099 --> 05:34.200
Now, I'm going to need your help
with a local realtor.

05:34.269 --> 05:35.535
Somebody that you trust.

05:35.537 --> 05:39.406
If I'm going to be here a while,
I can't be living in a motel.

05:39.408 --> 05:41.241
Right, if you're going
to be here a while.

05:43.345 --> 05:45.879
Keenan O'Dwyer.

05:46.014 --> 05:47.948
Nobody knows
the local market better.

05:55.257 --> 05:57.156
Yeah, maybe
you didn't understand.

05:57.225 --> 05:58.225
I'm looking for a condo.

05:58.293 --> 06:01.961
Something contemporary,
low maintenance, downtown.

06:02.030 --> 06:03.963
Trust me to know
my business, Mr. Connor.

06:04.032 --> 06:06.099
Those places are a dime a dozen.

06:06.168 --> 06:08.101
They're made of paper and spit.

06:08.170 --> 06:10.036
They go up in a week
and down in a year.

06:10.072 --> 06:14.174
I respect my clients too much
to show any of those.

06:14.309 --> 06:17.310
What you want
is something with character.

06:17.312 --> 06:20.046
No, no, I really
don't think that I do.

06:20.181 --> 06:22.448
How far from town is this place?

06:22.484 --> 06:26.052
Let's just say
you have your privacy.

06:26.187 --> 06:27.787
At least
look at the cottage before...

06:27.922 --> 06:29.890
Cottage!
It's a cottage?

06:29.924 --> 06:32.392
No, not quite as rustic
as that makes it sound.

06:32.461 --> 06:35.595
Only a good property
with some elbow room,

06:35.597 --> 06:38.531
assuming you have no strong
aversion to a little patchwork.

06:40.068 --> 06:42.535
I am really not looking
for a fixer-upper.

06:43.605 --> 06:47.406
Minor really, as such things go.

06:47.442 --> 06:49.409
Should be comin' up
right around this bend here.

06:49.544 --> 06:51.444
Good!

07:15.971 --> 07:18.838
Now, don't say no before
you give the place a chance,

07:18.907 --> 07:21.409
and don't let the present state
of the place cloud your vision.

07:21.443 --> 07:24.043
No one's sayin' that it
couldn't use some improvement.

07:24.046 --> 07:26.446
Must have been something once.

07:26.448 --> 07:29.515
With a little work,
it could be again.

07:29.584 --> 07:31.451
Most of the structure
is original.

07:31.586 --> 07:35.321
Some newer construction in parts,
if I remember right.

07:35.457 --> 07:39.525
The kitchen's been expanded,
but still,

07:39.594 --> 07:43.663
what you're really payin'
for here is the property.

07:43.665 --> 07:45.598
It's the best 10 acres
to be had around here...

07:45.634 --> 07:46.644
It's not at all
what I'm looking for.

07:46.668 --> 07:49.335
There's no way I could use
this much space.

07:49.371 --> 07:52.538
But she's a real charmer,
isn't she?

07:52.574 --> 07:54.207
Nothing like this in the city.

07:54.209 --> 07:55.453
I don't want to buy,
I want to lease.

07:55.477 --> 07:59.679
You don't strike me as the sort
to throw money away on rent.

07:59.681 --> 08:02.582
This here would be
an investment.

08:05.687 --> 08:08.108
Some fine examples
of local woodworking inside,

08:08.156 --> 08:11.223
a cabinet or two, as I recall.

08:11.259 --> 08:12.558
Those would stay?

08:12.594 --> 08:15.695
Part of the house
for 50 years or more.

08:15.697 --> 08:17.030
Take your time, look around.

08:17.032 --> 08:19.365
I have to check in with the office,
but, I'll be right here

08:19.501 --> 08:22.402
if you have any questions.

08:36.650 --> 08:39.052
It hasn't been
occupied in a bit.

08:39.054 --> 08:41.053
More than a bit, I'd say.

08:41.123 --> 08:43.456
That's a New England bit,
not a 'Frisco bit.

08:43.525 --> 08:45.992
20 years, maybe 30.

08:45.994 --> 08:46.994
That's a bit.

08:47.028 --> 08:48.595
The floors could use
some attention.

08:48.730 --> 08:52.064
Fireplace needs a look,
I suppose, but it's sound.

08:52.100 --> 08:53.466
Bedrooms upstairs?

08:53.468 --> 08:54.567
Yeah.

09:29.837 --> 09:32.639
Who owned it last, Mr. O'Dwyer?

09:34.543 --> 09:36.508
Mr. O'Dwyer?

09:36.545 --> 09:38.444
Hello?

09:40.715 --> 09:43.750
Mr. O'Dwyer?

09:46.154 --> 09:48.721
Hello?

09:50.525 --> 09:52.725
Hey, there you are.

09:52.727 --> 09:55.195
You know the people
who owned this place last?

09:55.330 --> 09:57.063
You mean who owns it now?

09:57.198 --> 09:58.530
The Kilgores
on the next property.

09:58.567 --> 10:00.600
They added this land to theirs
some time back.

10:00.602 --> 10:02.201
Left it as-is, though.

10:02.204 --> 10:03.536
Never moved anyone in.

10:03.538 --> 10:04.404
At least not for long.

10:04.539 --> 10:07.673
- You know why they want to sell?
- Well, they're older now.

10:07.742 --> 10:11.211
They always hoped their boys
would make the land work,

10:11.346 --> 10:15.448
but the kids grew up, moved to Boston
and opened up a coffee bar.

10:17.686 --> 10:21.153
Take a look.

10:22.357 --> 10:24.223
You've got to be kidding.

10:24.226 --> 10:25.825
No, there's got to be
a zero missing here.

10:25.827 --> 10:31.363
- This isn't California.
- Well, even so.

10:31.399 --> 10:37.737
- Well, seen enough?
- Yeah. I think I have.

10:41.643 --> 10:43.643
Well, considering the size
of the property

10:43.778 --> 10:45.578
and the age
and the style of the house...

10:45.647 --> 10:48.447
that's the number,
and it's a fair one.

10:48.483 --> 10:50.049
Not a penny more,
not a penny less.

10:50.184 --> 10:51.251
Thank you.

10:51.386 --> 10:52.863
The sticker doesn't
concern him, James.

10:52.887 --> 10:54.787
The price is fine,
Mr. Kilgore,

10:54.856 --> 10:57.657
but the place has been
sitting empty so long.

10:57.792 --> 11:00.326
- I guess what I'm curious about...
- As-is.

11:00.362 --> 11:02.462
- Excuse me?
- The place is as it is.

11:02.597 --> 11:05.197
Once the money changes hands,

11:05.267 --> 11:08.234
I wash my hands of the property
and everything on it.

11:11.172 --> 11:12.932
There's something
you guys aren't telling me.

11:14.676 --> 11:17.076
It's a lovely spot of land.

11:17.145 --> 11:18.544
You saw for yourself.

11:18.546 --> 11:20.479
Then, what, the roof leaks?

11:20.515 --> 11:21.748
I'd be shocked if it didn't.

11:21.750 --> 11:24.216
Contracts can be messy things.

11:24.252 --> 11:27.286
Taking it "as-is"
just greases the wheels.

11:27.322 --> 11:30.223
So is it yes or is it no?

11:31.826 --> 11:36.895
Well, it wasn't at all
what I was looking for, but...

11:36.931 --> 11:40.099
There's something about it
just feels right.

11:40.234 --> 11:42.735
So it's a yes.

11:45.306 --> 11:46.773
It's a yes.

11:48.276 --> 11:50.909
Well, in that case...
Here's to the new owner.

11:50.945 --> 11:53.246
Cheers.

12:03.358 --> 12:09.329
Well, Brian,
what have you gotten yourself into?

12:25.480 --> 12:28.881
Hey!

12:28.950 --> 12:30.950
Is somebody up there?

12:32.287 --> 12:33.986
Hello?

13:30.077 --> 13:31.343
I know you all put in the time,

13:31.413 --> 13:33.879
but it seems to be
on the honor system,

13:33.948 --> 13:35.882
and that's hard to account for.

13:35.884 --> 13:37.394
So, what are you saying,
you don't trust us?

13:37.418 --> 13:40.219
It's not a reflection
of trust or a lack of it...

13:40.354 --> 13:41.888
It's Dylan.

13:41.890 --> 13:43.968
Dylan,
look, you're all going to need

13:43.992 --> 13:46.760
to start keeping accurate track
of your hours.

13:46.894 --> 13:48.894
This is a creative
business, Mr. Connor.

13:48.930 --> 13:51.430
Creativity doesn't
punch a time-clock.

13:51.466 --> 13:52.832
Look, we're just saying, man...

13:52.834 --> 13:55.301
Some of us kinda work from home
when we feel like it.

13:55.436 --> 13:57.770
And some of you
kind of take advantage of that...

13:57.772 --> 13:59.305
None of you, of course.

13:59.441 --> 14:01.774
Creative or not,
this is a business.

14:01.776 --> 14:04.776
It's going to run like one
and look like one, all right?

14:04.813 --> 14:06.579
So, let's clean it up.

14:12.020 --> 14:13.586
Well, it serves you right.

14:13.721 --> 14:15.988
Who the hell
moves to Maine, anyway?

14:16.123 --> 14:17.735
Hey, man, I hope you're getting
some game in.

14:17.759 --> 14:19.525
When you get back,
we are playing for money.

14:19.527 --> 14:20.660
I'm in.

14:20.795 --> 14:22.061
Might be a while, though.

14:23.198 --> 14:24.597
You should see
how they're running this place.

14:24.599 --> 14:25.998
It's like a daycare center.

14:26.034 --> 14:27.332
It's creative,

14:27.368 --> 14:29.688
but not enough business sense
to fit inside of a thimble...

14:31.472 --> 14:34.740
except for the woman who had
the office before me, total pro.

14:34.742 --> 14:37.543
<i>What, did she just
walk in on you?</i>

14:37.612 --> 14:39.680
- Say hi to Stan?
- Hi, Stan.

14:39.747 --> 14:41.613
<i>She sounds hot.</i>

14:41.649 --> 14:43.816
<i>Hey, wanna date a doctor?</i>

14:43.818 --> 14:44.684
She's married.

14:44.819 --> 14:47.487
<i>Yeah, those two things aren't
mutually exclusive, my friend.</i>

14:47.588 --> 14:48.666
Look, I'm going to
have to call you back.

14:48.690 --> 14:52.024
<i>Hey, hey, just wanted to tell you,
I ran into Julie last night.</i>

14:52.159 --> 14:54.894
<i>She was asking about you.
I promised her an update.</i>

14:54.896 --> 14:55.896
<i>What do I tell her?</i>

14:57.966 --> 14:59.097
Tell her I'm sorry.

14:59.133 --> 15:01.033
<i>Didn't you
tell her that already?</i>

15:01.102 --> 15:03.702
Maybe from you
she would believe it.

15:03.771 --> 15:05.805
Look, I really do
have to call you back.

15:08.776 --> 15:09.975
For me?

15:10.044 --> 15:11.911
Pens, notepads and toner.

15:12.046 --> 15:14.380
And I can round up an empty
thimble if you need one.

15:14.382 --> 15:16.810
Okay, in my defense,
that was completely out of context.

15:17.852 --> 15:19.663
I hear you bought a house.
The old Kilgore place?

15:19.687 --> 15:21.053
I did.
You know it?

15:21.122 --> 15:22.788
Yeah, it's something
of a local landmark.

15:22.857 --> 15:24.568
It's going to take some work
before it's a home,

15:24.592 --> 15:26.058
but I'm hoping
by the time I leave,

15:26.193 --> 15:27.326
I can make a little profit.

15:27.395 --> 15:29.595
Lunch money, maybe.

15:29.597 --> 15:31.063
I thought you were looking
for something move-in ready.

15:31.065 --> 15:33.065
That O'Dwyer's
quite the salesman.

15:33.067 --> 15:34.467
It'll keep me busy.

15:34.602 --> 15:37.403
Work here, work there.

15:37.538 --> 15:38.582
A little avoidance therapy?

15:38.606 --> 15:41.073
Someone back home
you're trying to forget?

15:41.075 --> 15:43.075
Studying psychology
in our spare time, are we?

15:43.077 --> 15:45.611
Hey, I couldn't help but hear.

15:47.849 --> 15:50.549
I was engaged.

15:50.618 --> 15:53.019
Now I'm not.

15:53.154 --> 15:54.420
My fault.

15:54.422 --> 15:57.189
Not a doubt in my mind.

16:27.722 --> 16:28.754
Okay, light...

17:29.917 --> 17:32.785
<i>...after securing
the Democratic nomination,</i>

17:32.787 --> 17:34.653
<i>senator John Fitzgerald Kennedy</i>

17:34.722 --> 17:36.855
<i>addressed supporters
at the Los Angeles Coliseum...</i>

17:36.891 --> 17:38.990
Kennedy? JFK?

17:39.027 --> 17:40.526
<i>...let me say first
that I accept the nomination</i>

17:40.528 --> 17:42.595
<i>of the Democratic party.</i>

17:42.730 --> 17:46.532
<i>I accept it without reservation
and with only one obligation,</i>

17:46.601 --> 17:48.667
<i>the obligation to devote
every effort...</i>

17:48.670 --> 17:52.070
Okay, what is this,
the history channel?

18:28.643 --> 18:30.576
"True love".

19:16.157 --> 19:17.223
Hello?

19:17.358 --> 19:20.226
Kind of late to be wandering
out here alone, don't you think?

19:20.228 --> 19:23.361
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

19:23.397 --> 19:25.765
I live here.
I just bought this place.

19:25.900 --> 19:27.133
That's impossible.

19:28.202 --> 19:31.103
Did your car break down?
Do you need help?

19:31.238 --> 19:33.104
Stay back.
Stay away.

19:33.141 --> 19:36.008
You can't live here.
This is my house.

19:36.010 --> 19:37.978
- It's my garden.
- Your house?

19:38.045 --> 19:39.125
What are you talking about?

19:41.916 --> 19:46.185
I'm looking for something.

19:46.320 --> 19:47.320
For that.

19:50.992 --> 19:53.925
For this?

19:53.961 --> 19:55.761
Where did you find it?

19:57.131 --> 19:59.331
It slipped from my neck.

20:00.034 --> 20:04.036
Well, if it did,
it slipped a long time ago.

20:05.306 --> 20:06.405
Well, may I have it, please?

20:06.407 --> 20:07.407
Yeah.

20:11.946 --> 20:12.946
Did you see that?

20:13.014 --> 20:14.213
Whoever you are...

20:14.348 --> 20:16.817
whatever you are,
you stay away from us!

20:20.788 --> 20:22.154
Hey, that's my house!

20:27.428 --> 20:29.128
Find your locket?

20:32.233 --> 20:33.399
Nora, what is it?

20:35.203 --> 20:37.102
I think...

20:37.104 --> 20:38.104
I just saw a ghost.

20:39.874 --> 20:40.839
Hey!

20:40.842 --> 20:42.875
Miss?

20:57.758 --> 20:59.703
If someone's out here,
you step out and show yourself!

20:59.727 --> 21:01.126
You hear me?

21:01.195 --> 21:03.194
I didn't imagine it.

21:03.231 --> 21:04.930
He had my locket.

21:05.065 --> 21:06.065
That was no ghost.

21:06.133 --> 21:07.399
The man's a thief.

21:07.468 --> 21:09.068
Thomas, come back
inside, please.

21:09.203 --> 21:11.803
He didn't seem dangerous.

21:11.873 --> 21:13.239
I won't put up with trespassers.

21:14.442 --> 21:17.637
You step foot on my property again,
and this is what's waiting for you!

21:23.117 --> 21:24.416
Get back in the house.

21:29.924 --> 21:30.889
<i>Did he touch you?</i>

21:30.892 --> 21:31.902
<i>Did he try to take something?</i>

21:31.926 --> 21:34.360
No, he didn't touch me.
He tried to give it back.

21:34.428 --> 21:36.028
<i>Well, why didn't you take it?</i>

21:36.163 --> 21:37.474
<i>Well, I was frightened,
I suppose,</i>

21:37.498 --> 21:39.031
<i>I don't think he meant any harm.</i>

21:39.033 --> 21:40.966
<i>Sneaking around here
in the middle of the night,</i>

21:41.002 --> 21:43.168
<i>he can't have been
up to anything good.</i>

21:43.170 --> 21:43.969
<i>Have you seen him before?</i>

21:43.971 --> 21:44.770
<i>Do you know him?</i>

21:44.772 --> 21:45.570
<i>No.</i>

21:45.640 --> 21:51.510
<i>- Nora, if you're lying to me...
- Thomas, I'm not lying.</i>

23:49.630 --> 23:51.430
Good morning, Frank.

23:51.432 --> 23:53.165
Morning.

23:53.234 --> 23:57.035
The garden's showing off
for summer, Mrs. Hargrave.

23:57.038 --> 23:58.570
The azaleas in particular.

23:58.606 --> 24:01.173
If you mean those,
they're dahlias.

24:01.242 --> 24:02.975
Well, I beg your pardon.

24:03.110 --> 24:04.110
No problem.

24:04.178 --> 24:06.378
A handyman doesn't need
to know his flowers.

24:06.380 --> 24:09.314
Something that beautiful,
I like to know about.

24:09.383 --> 24:12.918
- What've you got there, Clemens?
- The bench your wife asked for.

24:12.920 --> 24:15.087
I could use a hand
if you've got a minute.

24:18.125 --> 24:19.925
Nora?

24:28.469 --> 24:29.868
Frank, it's marvelous.

24:29.937 --> 24:31.470
Where do you want it?

24:31.539 --> 24:34.540
Over here, I suppose.

24:34.542 --> 24:36.007
I...

24:36.077 --> 24:38.944
We can set it down here for now.

24:41.281 --> 24:42.614
The workmanship is wonderful.

24:42.650 --> 24:43.650
Thank you.

24:43.684 --> 24:44.684
What do we owe you?

24:44.751 --> 24:47.486
Just for the materials.

24:47.488 --> 24:48.687
Nothing for your time?

24:48.689 --> 24:51.356
You paid me well enough for
the bed frame, Mr. Hargrave.

24:51.425 --> 24:52.425
Let this be my gift.

24:52.493 --> 24:54.560
That's a sweet thought,
but we really couldn't...

24:54.628 --> 24:56.348
just leave us the bill
and let that be that.

24:58.432 --> 24:59.443
Well, I need to get to work.

24:59.467 --> 25:01.011
What time should I
expect you for dinner?

25:01.035 --> 25:02.634
It'll be late.

25:02.670 --> 25:05.637
The Avery case
goes to court tomorrow,

25:05.639 --> 25:07.372
and Steve's still in Florida.

25:07.374 --> 25:09.455
Till he gets back,
everything's falling to me.

25:10.578 --> 25:13.245
I don't suppose you were
prowling around out here

25:13.314 --> 25:14.346
last night, were you?

25:15.583 --> 25:17.516
Why would I be doing that?

25:18.652 --> 25:21.253
It's simply a question, Clemens.

25:21.255 --> 25:22.454
Just a question.

25:26.660 --> 25:30.195
Did something happen last night?

25:30.197 --> 25:34.600
Nothing worth mentioning.

25:38.139 --> 25:41.739
So, over here, you think?

25:41.775 --> 25:43.275
Careful with that.

25:43.344 --> 25:45.077
Easy...

25:46.547 --> 25:48.012
I got it.

25:48.048 --> 25:49.681
You okay?

25:54.155 --> 25:58.089
The perfect spot,
don't you think?

25:59.359 --> 26:02.160
I can sit and read,
or just watch the garden grow.

26:02.196 --> 26:04.162
It grows quickly, does it?

26:04.198 --> 26:06.431
Just how green is
that thumb of yours?

26:06.567 --> 26:08.233
Make fun if you want, Frank,

26:08.235 --> 26:10.368
but there's something
magical about this place.

26:10.437 --> 26:11.570
Well, not before you came.

26:11.639 --> 26:13.705
I did some work for
the harwoods before you.

26:13.774 --> 26:17.509
They couldn't
grow weeds back here.

26:17.644 --> 26:22.648
"Some can pot begonias,
some can bud a Rose,

26:22.650 --> 26:26.251
"some are hardly fit to trust
with anything that grows".

26:26.320 --> 26:30.121
Kipling.

26:30.191 --> 26:32.056
The man knew what
he was talking about.

26:32.092 --> 26:34.058
You've got the touch.

26:34.094 --> 26:35.334
My mother had a victory garden.

26:35.396 --> 26:39.797
Fed the whole neighborhood
from it through the war years.

26:39.833 --> 26:44.102
Me, I'm partial to flowers.

26:45.405 --> 26:46.565
I think I need to rest a bit.

26:46.607 --> 26:48.340
I'll leave you to do
what you have to do.

26:48.475 --> 26:50.142
Can I bring you something?

26:50.144 --> 26:51.821
A coffee to start the day,
if you don't mind.

26:51.845 --> 26:53.378
All right.

27:30.918 --> 27:32.598
I think that's all
you can fit in that cup.

27:32.653 --> 27:34.720
That is why I need
my morning coffee.

27:34.722 --> 27:36.623
- Thank you.
- Sure.

27:36.657 --> 27:39.257
Have you gotten any sleep at all
since you've been here?

27:39.260 --> 27:42.327
Yeah, all that I need.

27:42.396 --> 27:46.664
You said that you're familiar with
the property I bought, right?

27:46.700 --> 27:48.200
Yeah, we all used to play
up in that area

27:48.202 --> 27:49.346
when we were kids.
Why do you ask?

27:49.370 --> 27:51.203
Are there any stories about it?

27:51.338 --> 27:54.206
Local legends, anything?

27:54.208 --> 27:56.341
This is New England.
Every house has a story.

27:56.410 --> 27:57.542
You know, who slept there,
who was born there,

27:57.544 --> 27:58.476
who died there.

27:58.545 --> 28:00.879
Who died there...

28:00.881 --> 28:02.481
So, any ghost stories?

28:02.483 --> 28:04.416
Well, you know,
most everybody's heard

28:04.551 --> 28:06.418
one or two wild yarns
over the years.

28:06.553 --> 28:07.686
Do you believe them?

28:07.755 --> 28:11.590
As a kid I did, sure, but
kids'll believe anything, right?

28:12.959 --> 28:15.494
If you bump into one,
let me know.

28:16.730 --> 28:19.464
- Staff meeting at 10:00?
- Staff meeting at 10:00.

29:07.547 --> 29:08.947
Hi.

29:08.949 --> 29:09.681
Please don't go.

29:09.816 --> 29:11.549
If my husband
sees you out here...

29:11.585 --> 29:14.485
- You have a husband?
- He won't like this at all.

29:14.521 --> 29:16.555
I just want to talk.

29:18.358 --> 29:19.402
I don't understand
what's happening.

29:19.426 --> 29:20.425
Who are you?

29:20.427 --> 29:21.493
Why are you here?

29:21.562 --> 29:22.872
I have
the same question for you.

29:22.896 --> 29:24.563
This is my home.

29:24.565 --> 29:27.632
The funny thing about that is,
this is my home, too.

29:27.634 --> 29:28.834
I'm Brian Connor.

29:30.404 --> 29:31.302
Are you okay?

29:31.338 --> 29:32.637
I just...

29:32.773 --> 29:35.573
A headache from this,
from you, my locket.

29:35.609 --> 29:38.776
There are
some unusual things going on,

29:38.812 --> 29:41.379
and I think that they have
something to do with that locket.

29:41.382 --> 29:43.848
You saw what happened.

29:43.884 --> 29:45.917
Can you explain that?

29:45.919 --> 29:46.985
I can't.

29:48.722 --> 29:49.966
Okay, this is going to be
a strange question,

29:49.990 --> 29:51.256
but I have to ask.

29:51.258 --> 29:52.290
What year is it?

29:53.326 --> 29:54.592
Do I look that stupid?

29:54.661 --> 29:56.595
What year is it for you?

29:56.597 --> 29:58.597
A year is a year.

29:58.599 --> 30:01.266
It's the same for everyone.

30:01.335 --> 30:03.435
1960.

30:05.272 --> 30:06.272
1960?

30:08.809 --> 30:11.409
Why are you looking
at me like that?

30:11.478 --> 30:15.480
Because for me,
it's 50 years later.

30:15.516 --> 30:16.815
That's impossible.

30:16.950 --> 30:19.751
Here, look,
I'll show you my license.

30:19.886 --> 30:21.019
Okay, see that right there?

30:21.021 --> 30:22.888
That year?

30:22.890 --> 30:25.824
That's the year I was born.

30:29.830 --> 30:32.832
The flowers in the house,
are those from you?

30:32.966 --> 30:35.967
Are they from this garden?

30:36.036 --> 30:36.968
I pick them fresh each day.

30:37.004 --> 30:38.436
There are no flowers here now.

30:38.472 --> 30:39.472
No flowers...

30:39.506 --> 30:40.906
There are flowers everywhere...

30:40.908 --> 30:41.973
No, they're not here.

30:42.042 --> 30:42.907
Not where I am.

30:42.976 --> 30:45.776
Look!

30:45.813 --> 30:48.079
Look here.

30:59.059 --> 31:00.325
What just happened?

31:05.799 --> 31:09.467
I don't understand this
any more than you do.

31:09.470 --> 31:13.271
There are 50 years
between you and I,

31:13.406 --> 31:18.577
and yet, somehow,
you and I, we share this space.

32:02.956 --> 32:04.856
The wood wasn't sealed properly.

32:04.925 --> 32:07.592
The roses could bring this down.

32:07.628 --> 32:09.861
You can save it, Frank.

32:09.996 --> 32:12.063
That's the kind of faith
I have in you.

32:12.132 --> 32:13.665
You're obviously
not from around here.

32:13.734 --> 32:15.094
You don't have
the Maine pessimism.

32:23.911 --> 32:25.744
Still under the weather?

32:27.548 --> 32:29.681
A cold or something, I suppose,

32:29.750 --> 32:32.684
but it doesn't usually
hang on like this.

32:37.758 --> 32:39.624
I should go in.

32:47.167 --> 32:49.434
You must have better things
to do than watch me garden.

32:49.436 --> 32:51.747
I thought he was done
with the work we asked him to do.

32:51.771 --> 32:53.883
He was,
but there's always something,

32:53.907 --> 32:54.972
and with you not around...

32:55.008 --> 32:56.174
What's wrong with the arbor?

32:57.444 --> 33:00.845
Age, weather,
the weight of the roses.

33:00.981 --> 33:03.582
I'd like to see this garden
last another 50 years.

33:04.585 --> 33:06.885
- Why 50?
- Thomas, it's just a number.

33:17.698 --> 33:21.634
<i>- Another headache?
- It'll pass.</i>

33:22.736 --> 33:25.203
- And the fever last night?
- I'm fine.

33:25.205 --> 33:28.806
If I weren't, who'd fix
your meals and clean the house,

33:28.875 --> 33:29.674
Frank out there?

33:29.809 --> 33:31.743
I don't like the way
he looks at you.

33:31.812 --> 33:34.714
He looks at me because we talk,
no other reason.

33:34.748 --> 33:36.848
Maybe if I were
one of your clients,

33:36.850 --> 33:38.617
I could get your attention
now and then, too.

33:48.228 --> 33:49.228
Thomas...

33:50.797 --> 33:52.075
Tom, please, I've been thinking.

33:52.099 --> 33:53.965
It's so lonely out here
when you're gone,

33:54.100 --> 33:55.700
and I know how hard you work...

33:55.736 --> 33:58.169
You have no idea what I have
to deal with every day.

33:58.171 --> 34:00.638
The pressures of my job,
what's expected of me.

34:00.674 --> 34:02.907
Nora, what is this about?

34:02.943 --> 34:05.710
The dress shop in town
is advertising for help.

34:05.845 --> 34:07.578
Are you saying
I can't support us?

34:07.614 --> 34:08.846
I'm not saying that.

34:08.915 --> 34:11.815
Then there's no need
for you to work...

34:13.085 --> 34:16.321
And once he is done with that arbor,
he is done, for good.

34:17.322 --> 34:19.824
Am I understood?

34:48.054 --> 34:50.221
<i>"Dear Mr. Connor,</i>

34:50.223 --> 34:52.556
<i>"knowing you may one day
be redoing this cottage</i>

34:52.692 --> 34:53.891
<i>"to suit you,</i>

34:54.027 --> 34:55.159
<i>"I thought I could write</i>

34:55.228 --> 34:57.629
<i>"and hide this letter
somewhere you might find it</i>

34:57.764 --> 34:59.630
<i>"all those years from now".</i>

34:59.666 --> 35:00.899
<i>"You may be nothing more</i>

35:00.901 --> 35:03.835
<i>"than a fever-induced
figment of my imagination,</i>

35:03.837 --> 35:05.770
<i>"and that would be fine, too,</i>

35:05.905 --> 35:08.305
<i>"since even an imaginary friend</i>

35:08.341 --> 35:13.244
<i>"is more than I have
at the moment.</i>

35:17.284 --> 35:21.719
<i>"Did I introduce myself
when we met in the garden?</i>

35:21.722 --> 35:24.956
<i>"I can't remember.</i>

35:25.826 --> 35:29.861
<i>"My name is Nora Hargrave.</i>

35:29.930 --> 35:32.931
<i>"I haven't had an experience
with ghosts before,</i>

35:32.933 --> 35:37.802
<i>"so I'm not clear about this.</i>

35:37.838 --> 35:41.806
<i>"Am I the ghost, or are you?</i>

35:41.842 --> 35:43.140
<i>"I thought that sort of thing</i>

35:43.176 --> 35:46.677
<i>"came only out of
some unspeakable tragedy,</i>

35:46.747 --> 35:48.746
<i>"but the only tragedy in my life</i>

35:48.782 --> 35:52.883
<i>"is this marriage.</i>

35:52.919 --> 35:55.553
<i>"I moved to this house
and this state</i>

35:55.688 --> 35:56.955
<i>"a little over a year ago</i>

35:56.957 --> 35:58.756
<i>"when I married my husband,</i>

35:58.792 --> 36:00.792
<i>"for all the wrong reasons.</i>

36:00.927 --> 36:03.027
<i>"I didn't know him well enough,</i>

36:03.163 --> 36:05.830
<i>"and now that I do,
it's too late,</i>

36:05.866 --> 36:08.032
<i>"but I've made my bed.</i>

36:08.034 --> 36:11.035
<i>"Isn't that the expression?</i>

36:11.171 --> 36:13.971
<i>"Some men change
after they get what they want.</i>

36:14.007 --> 36:16.707
<i>"That's Thomas in a nutshell.</i>

36:16.777 --> 36:18.109
<i>"I fell in love,</i>

36:18.244 --> 36:19.977
<i>"or at least I thought I did,</i>

36:20.013 --> 36:23.314
<i>"with an exciting attorney,
slightly older,</i>

36:23.350 --> 36:25.750
<i>"set in his ways.</i>

36:27.053 --> 36:28.920
<i>"But the minute I said "I do,"</i>

36:29.055 --> 36:31.389
<i>"he became moody and possessive,</i>

36:31.391 --> 36:34.592
<i>"never trusting me,</i>

36:34.661 --> 36:36.661
<i>"always watching
from a doorway or window,</i>

36:36.796 --> 36:39.730
<i>"a terrible temper.</i>

36:39.766 --> 36:42.100
<i>"How did I miss that?</i>

36:45.138 --> 36:48.206
<i>"That's not what I thought
love would be.</i>

36:48.208 --> 36:50.341
<i>"It's certainly not
what I hoped.</i>

36:50.343 --> 36:51.809
Nora!

36:51.812 --> 36:53.211
Are you upstairs?

36:58.284 --> 36:59.684
Okay, this is good.

36:59.753 --> 37:01.731
This is strong work on
the managed service providers,

37:01.755 --> 37:03.821
but security tests came back

37:03.890 --> 37:06.224
with a whole host of bugs
that need your attention.

37:06.226 --> 37:08.092
Mia, why don't you
pitch in on that?

37:08.094 --> 37:09.160
And Dylan,

37:09.162 --> 37:11.162
I need you to revise
the SSL certificates.

37:11.164 --> 37:12.429
Two attempts in a week.

37:12.465 --> 37:13.831
These hackers are killin' us.

37:13.900 --> 37:15.166
All right, I got it.

37:15.168 --> 37:15.900
Good.

37:16.035 --> 37:17.368
Okay, next.

37:17.503 --> 37:20.771
Yes, research,
they finally came up with

37:20.841 --> 37:23.174
our top five
VPS hosting competitors.

37:23.243 --> 37:27.045
I want everybody in here to read
this report and stay sharp,

37:27.113 --> 37:28.045
and I mean everybody.

37:28.081 --> 37:30.715
Brian, I think everyone's
put in a long one.

37:30.850 --> 37:32.161
How about we call it
quits for today?

37:32.185 --> 37:33.985
Okay, yeah, well, good.

37:34.054 --> 37:36.388
Great work, everybody,
and let's call it a day.

37:36.456 --> 37:38.323
You know, you should
take a break, too.

37:38.458 --> 37:40.825
It wouldn't hurt you
to kick back a little.

38:02.883 --> 38:04.148
Barely past 6:00.

38:04.150 --> 38:05.416
Half a day today?

38:05.551 --> 38:07.084
My reputation precedes me.

38:07.153 --> 38:09.020
I'm not sure
how I feel about that.

38:09.155 --> 38:10.955
Set my friend up over here?

38:12.358 --> 38:13.358
The usual.

38:13.426 --> 38:14.959
Thank you,
that's very kind of you.

38:16.296 --> 38:18.829
So, how's the cottage?

38:18.899 --> 38:20.365
Everything... quiet out there?

38:21.567 --> 38:23.167
Why wouldn't it be?

38:23.203 --> 38:26.503
Old houses have
their peculiarities is all.

38:26.539 --> 38:29.307
So before me,

38:29.442 --> 38:32.109
before the Kilgores,
who lived in the place?

38:32.145 --> 38:36.848
That'd be a while back,
almost before my time.

38:36.850 --> 38:38.127
The name Hargrave
mean anything to you?

38:38.151 --> 38:40.384
Hargrave, you say?

38:40.420 --> 38:41.986
Thanks, hon'.

38:42.121 --> 38:45.123
A lawyer and his wife.

38:45.125 --> 38:48.026
Do you have any idea
what happened to them?

38:49.862 --> 38:51.396
Where did you hear that name?

38:51.398 --> 38:54.065
I found it on some papers
at the house.

38:54.067 --> 38:58.202
It's probably best you don't
spread that around town.

38:59.372 --> 39:01.939
Some things happen
time has no way of healing.

39:01.942 --> 39:03.302
No, no, you can't
leave it at that.

39:03.343 --> 39:05.109
I think I can.

39:06.145 --> 39:07.879
Thanks for the drink.

39:08.014 --> 39:10.881
I have heard things out there.

39:10.951 --> 39:12.016
Voices.

39:16.156 --> 39:17.855
You don't seem
all that surprised.

39:18.992 --> 39:20.892
No! No, I am.

39:20.894 --> 39:23.427
Voices in the house, you say?

39:23.496 --> 39:24.294
My goodness.

39:24.331 --> 39:28.434
- And I've seen a woman.
- You saw her?

39:29.369 --> 39:31.469
Then you do know
what I'm talking about!

39:34.307 --> 39:36.418
If you think you can get out
of the real estate contract,

39:36.442 --> 39:39.577
Mr. Connor,
that deal is iron-clad.

39:39.579 --> 39:41.045
You agreed to take it as-is.

39:41.114 --> 39:41.912
I am not trying...

39:41.948 --> 39:43.625
I'm just trying to figure out
what I'm dealing with.

39:43.649 --> 39:45.516
Is it all in my head?

39:45.651 --> 39:48.119
Old houses play tricks is all.

39:49.255 --> 39:51.989
I remember a place
I had with my first wife...

39:52.058 --> 39:53.102
when the winter winds
came howling,

39:53.126 --> 39:53.991
I remember one night...

39:54.060 --> 39:56.394
Did the winds talk to you?

39:56.396 --> 39:57.436
Did you talk to the winds?

39:59.132 --> 40:00.330
You...

40:00.367 --> 40:03.167
You've had
an actual conversation?

40:04.371 --> 40:05.603
More than once.

40:09.609 --> 40:13.479
Well, all I can say is,
I never believed it,

40:13.546 --> 40:16.013
but if something is
happening out there...

40:16.016 --> 40:17.615
which I'm not saying it is...

40:17.617 --> 40:19.550
then such things need to stay
dead and buried.

40:19.685 --> 40:21.485
Good day, Mr. Connor.

40:21.554 --> 40:23.454
Thanks for the drink.

40:45.645 --> 40:47.645
<i>"Dear Mr. Connor,</i>

40:47.647 --> 40:52.016
<i>"I find it oddly comforting
writing to you.</i>

40:53.453 --> 40:55.519
<i>"Thomas insisted on this place</i>

40:55.588 --> 40:58.322
<i>"far from just about everything.</i>

40:58.324 --> 41:03.327
<i>"He says he needs the quiet
this cottage affords.</i>

41:03.463 --> 41:05.996
<i>"It does have that, all right.</i>

41:06.032 --> 41:09.333
<i>"In abundance.</i>

41:09.469 --> 41:13.171
<i>"So I've made
this garden my life...</i>

41:14.974 --> 41:18.643
<i>But can loneliness be fatal,
I wonder?"</i>

41:32.725 --> 41:36.627
Sorry to call you all this way
for what's probably nothing.

41:36.696 --> 41:38.562
Headaches, night sweats.

41:38.598 --> 41:40.898
Anything else?

41:40.967 --> 41:42.432
A sort of ache in my joints.

41:42.469 --> 41:45.236
I thought it must be the weather,
but it doesn't go away.

41:45.371 --> 41:46.449
But you're originally
from Ohio, aren't you?

41:46.473 --> 41:50.107
Well, then you ought to be
used to our seasons by now.

41:50.176 --> 41:51.976
Still, it's a possibility.

41:52.045 --> 41:53.044
Will this take long?

41:53.046 --> 41:54.579
I can't imagine
it's anything serious.

41:54.714 --> 41:56.113
It isn't, is it?

41:56.116 --> 41:57.047
What's this?

41:57.117 --> 41:58.117
What's this rash?

41:58.184 --> 42:00.184
It's been there a while.

42:00.319 --> 42:01.385
She works in the garden.

42:01.521 --> 42:05.389
It's thorns from some roses,
nettles from the brush.

42:05.425 --> 42:06.757
Maybe.

42:09.028 --> 42:12.663
Well, I have a court date,
so I can't be late for that.

42:12.665 --> 42:13.931
Let me walk you out, Tom.

42:14.066 --> 42:15.066
I'll be back in a minute.

42:15.068 --> 42:19.103
We need to take a blood sample,
just to be sure.

42:25.311 --> 42:27.345
I'm concerned about
your wife's health,

42:27.347 --> 42:28.457
and I'm surprised
that you're not.

42:28.481 --> 42:30.281
Nora's always been soft.

42:30.350 --> 42:31.548
Nothing's ever easy with her.

42:31.584 --> 42:32.761
But if the woman's truly ill...

42:32.785 --> 42:34.151
Nora wants attention.

42:35.054 --> 42:36.153
Look, as I said,

42:36.222 --> 42:39.090
I've seen these same symptoms
all over this area, the same odd rash.

42:39.092 --> 42:41.358
Is something wrong with
Mrs. Hargrave?

42:41.427 --> 42:43.694
Family business, Clemens,
and none of yours.

42:47.300 --> 42:48.344
I'm telling you,
most of this is in her head.

42:48.368 --> 42:49.678
You give her
a lotion for the rash,

42:49.702 --> 42:51.669
something for her headache,
and she'll be fine.

42:53.473 --> 42:56.274
You've got my office number.

43:01.314 --> 43:04.648
You shouldn't be out of bed.

43:04.684 --> 43:06.117
He's not happy I'm sick.

43:06.252 --> 43:08.652
Well, the man can't blame you
for having an illness.

43:08.688 --> 43:10.388
You don't know my husband.

43:10.523 --> 43:11.989
I know him.

43:12.124 --> 43:13.657
He's been my patient
for a long time.

43:13.726 --> 43:16.127
Stubborn man, your husband.

43:16.262 --> 43:18.262
You're not telling me
anything I don't know.

43:18.397 --> 43:20.064
Still, he treats you well?

43:20.066 --> 43:21.132
You're happy enough?

43:21.134 --> 43:22.833
Would it make any difference
if I said no?

43:26.138 --> 43:28.139
Well, let's...
Let's draw that blood.

43:45.792 --> 43:47.525
Come on, Nora...

43:53.499 --> 43:55.700
<i>"I could tell from the way
Dr. Bowers acted</i>

43:55.702 --> 43:58.235
<i>"that there's something wrong.</i>

43:58.238 --> 44:00.371
<i>"Maybe it's this place.</i>

44:00.373 --> 44:03.440
<i>"The headaches only began
when I moved here,</i>

44:03.509 --> 44:05.443
<i>"or shortly after,</i>

44:05.445 --> 44:10.114
<i>"so it doesn't take much
for me to associate them,</i>

44:10.116 --> 44:12.516
<i>"and there's a rash on my arm,</i>

44:12.518 --> 44:15.452
<i>"round and red,
like a bulls eye.</i>

44:15.521 --> 44:18.322
<i>"My husband thinks it's only
a scratch from the garden,</i>

44:18.457 --> 44:20.724
<i>but that should have
gone away weeks ago".</i>

44:22.895 --> 44:26.330
<i>"Then there are the fevers
and the pain in my joints</i>

44:26.366 --> 44:29.333
<i>"that keep me in bed
more and more lately.</i>

44:29.335 --> 44:33.737
<i>"But all this from a rash?
Really?</i>

44:33.806 --> 44:35.205
<i>"I'm beginning to wonder</i>

44:35.275 --> 44:37.808
<i>"if this isn't just
all in my head.</i>

44:37.844 --> 44:39.610
<i>"This is why
I'm not entirely certain</i>

44:39.612 --> 44:42.480
<i>"I'm actually writing
to anyone at all,</i>

44:42.615 --> 44:46.150
<i>"because in my fever
the other day,</i>

44:46.152 --> 44:49.686
<i>"I swear I saw you
at the bedroom doorway.</i>

44:49.722 --> 44:53.291
<i>"You looked
very concerned about me,</i>

44:53.426 --> 44:56.761
<i>"and I take that as a comfort
these days,</i>

44:56.896 --> 45:00.364
<i>when there's
so little else to depend on".</i>

45:05.772 --> 45:06.915
<i>All the symptoms
you're giving me</i>

45:06.939 --> 45:08.773
<i>are classic Lyme disease.</i>

45:08.908 --> 45:11.108
<i>I mean, the rash alone's
a dead giveaway.</i>

45:11.177 --> 45:13.110
<i>Your friend's doctor
couldn't figure that out?</i>

45:13.179 --> 45:16.180
He's not up on
the latest breakthroughs.

45:16.249 --> 45:17.781
<i>Yeah, it's not exactly news.</i>

45:17.850 --> 45:19.850
<i>We've been treating this
since the mid-'70s.</i>

45:19.985 --> 45:21.163
<i>That's some crack medical staff</i>

45:21.187 --> 45:22.720
<i>she has in her corner.</i>

45:22.789 --> 45:24.349
<i>She's gotta get this
taken care of, man.</i>

45:24.390 --> 45:26.390
So Lyme disease,
this is serious.

45:26.426 --> 45:28.392
<i>It varies, but, yeah, sure.</i>

45:28.428 --> 45:30.127
<i>I mean, it could
lead to meningitis,</i>

45:30.262 --> 45:31.395
<i>paralysis.</i>

45:31.464 --> 45:32.529
<i>Even heart problems.</i>

45:32.565 --> 45:34.532
Okay, well, you know,
I want to help her out.

45:34.667 --> 45:35.667
Can you send me a list

45:35.735 --> 45:37.267
of the medicines
she should be taking?

45:37.337 --> 45:39.403
It's all pretty
straight-forward, man.

45:39.405 --> 45:41.272
Any doctor worth his
or her degree back there...

45:41.274 --> 45:42.807
Stan, I need a list.

45:42.942 --> 45:44.386
Can you e-mail me one?
Can you do that?

45:44.410 --> 45:46.410
For you, sure.

45:46.446 --> 45:47.745
<i>One more thing.</i>

45:47.880 --> 45:49.746
<i>You've got to
limit it to medicines</i>

45:49.782 --> 45:52.216
<i>that they would have
had on hand in 1960.</i>

45:52.285 --> 45:53.285
1960?

45:54.354 --> 45:55.597
There's more to this story,
isn't there?

45:55.621 --> 45:56.887
I've got to get this.

45:56.889 --> 45:57.821
<i>Don't you even think
about leave me hanging like...</i>

45:57.890 --> 45:59.690
<i>as soon as you can, Stan, okay?</i>

45:59.759 --> 46:00.759
Hey, hey!

46:01.527 --> 46:03.627
This is Brian Connor.

46:03.663 --> 46:05.162
<i>Brian?
Hey, it's me.</i>

46:05.231 --> 46:06.430
Julie!

46:06.466 --> 46:08.899
<i>I am so sorry that I hurt you.</i>

46:08.968 --> 46:10.768
No, look, it's okay.

46:10.770 --> 46:12.703
No need to replay
that conversation.

46:12.838 --> 46:16.307
I don't even really know
why I called.

46:16.442 --> 46:18.242
I guess it's 'cause

46:18.244 --> 46:19.788
I'm going to a friend's wedding
this weekend.

46:19.812 --> 46:22.313
<i>Any wonder it made me
think of you?</i>

46:22.448 --> 46:25.383
My priorities
were totally screwed up, and...

46:25.484 --> 46:28.452
yeah, well, your career
has always come first,

46:28.488 --> 46:30.688
and it wasn't just
that night, Brian.

46:32.658 --> 46:33.791
<i>I'm sorry I called.</i>

46:33.926 --> 46:34.926
<i>I think it was a mistake.</i>

46:34.994 --> 46:35.926
<i>It was just that</i>

46:35.962 --> 46:39.864
I was thinking about you,
and I was missing your voice.

46:39.866 --> 46:41.865
Jules...

46:41.934 --> 46:43.401
<i>Please, listen.</i>

46:43.536 --> 46:45.536
Brian, I've got to go.

47:02.522 --> 47:04.622
Thank you, Stan.

47:26.946 --> 47:31.515
I don't know
if this works both ways, but...

47:33.586 --> 47:35.586
It's worth a shot.

47:37.924 --> 47:40.057
<i>"Dear Nora,
show this to your doctor.</i>

47:40.059 --> 47:41.658
<i>"It's from a friend of mine</i>

47:41.727 --> 47:43.828
<i>who knows
what he's talking about".</i>

47:52.738 --> 47:56.040
Hey.

47:58.044 --> 47:59.342
I don't mean to disturb you,

47:59.378 --> 48:02.346
but I thought maybe
some soup and some tea...

48:02.348 --> 48:03.814
You made that for me?

48:06.052 --> 48:07.484
Don't be too impressed.

48:07.520 --> 48:10.020
I just opened a can
and boiled some water.

48:10.056 --> 48:11.056
Thank you.

48:11.090 --> 48:13.735
I thought, with your husband
not here to take care of you...

48:13.759 --> 48:15.959
It can't be helped.

48:16.028 --> 48:18.562
He's working on
an important case in Augusta

48:18.598 --> 48:20.097
for a couple of days.

48:20.099 --> 48:22.366
He made arrangements
for Dr. Bowers to check on me.

48:22.435 --> 48:23.767
Well, you still got to eat.

48:23.903 --> 48:26.537
Keep up your strength.

48:27.406 --> 48:29.540
Here, let me fix those pillows.

48:31.410 --> 48:33.043
You're very good at this.

48:33.045 --> 48:36.380
My mother was a nurse.

48:36.382 --> 48:37.715
I hope you like tomato.

48:37.717 --> 48:39.127
It was all I could find
in the kitchen.

48:39.151 --> 48:41.452
It's good.

48:41.454 --> 48:42.519
It's hot.

48:42.522 --> 48:45.856
If you're hungry after that,

48:45.858 --> 48:47.178
I could whip up
a cheese sandwich.

48:49.161 --> 48:51.595
But that's about the extent
of my kitchen skills.

48:51.664 --> 48:53.664
Well, it's too bad
your mother wasn't a chef.

48:53.799 --> 48:56.066
Oh, now, she could cook.

48:56.102 --> 48:58.068
She just never taught me.

48:59.605 --> 49:03.340
Frank, I need to ask a favor.

49:03.409 --> 49:07.444
Yes, ma'am.

49:19.058 --> 49:20.758
Do you mind if I ask...

49:20.893 --> 49:23.594
How did you two meet?

49:26.699 --> 49:32.836
A legal conference in Cincinnati.
I was working the front desk.

49:32.905 --> 49:35.706
He wasn't like anyone
I'd met before.

49:35.841 --> 49:37.152
Well, there's one thing
we can agree on.

49:37.176 --> 49:39.009
You don't like him
much, do you, Frank?

49:40.512 --> 49:43.113
I have no reason to think
one way or another

49:43.182 --> 49:45.049
about Mr. Hargrave.

49:57.530 --> 49:58.462
Who did you say
gave you this list?

49:58.464 --> 49:59.396
A doctor?

49:59.465 --> 50:05.002
A friend who wants to help,
and I trust him.

50:05.004 --> 50:06.114
Do the medications
make any sense,

50:06.138 --> 50:07.605
given what I'm dealing with.

50:07.740 --> 50:09.406
Well, on the face of it,
possibly.

50:09.475 --> 50:11.741
Quite an interesting approach.

50:11.777 --> 50:13.810
Most of these drugs
are brand-new on the market.

50:13.879 --> 50:15.679
I hoped they might be
worth a try.

50:15.748 --> 50:17.081
Well, there are risks,
of course.

50:17.216 --> 50:18.348
They may do nothing at all,

50:18.351 --> 50:19.895
or you may have an adverse
reaction to the drugs.

50:19.919 --> 50:23.153
Well, anything is better than
what I'm living with now.

50:24.824 --> 50:27.024
Then it's absolutely
worth a try.

50:27.026 --> 50:28.525
Let's give you
that prescription.

51:00.192 --> 51:02.859
Come on, Nora.

51:02.895 --> 51:06.596
Tell me
if the drugs are working.

51:18.878 --> 51:21.812
What is all this he gave you?

51:21.947 --> 51:23.480
You know, these
could be the problem.

51:23.549 --> 51:24.726
You need to
get rid of this stuff...

51:24.750 --> 51:27.818
no, no, no, no, Thomas,
I know those are...

51:27.953 --> 51:28.997
I know those are right for me.

51:29.021 --> 51:30.021
Please.

51:30.089 --> 51:31.133
Please, don't
take those from me.

51:31.157 --> 51:32.756
I need them.

51:32.792 --> 51:34.892
Please?

51:35.027 --> 51:37.094
Please!

52:14.666 --> 52:18.068
So, she tell you
she had a rough night?

52:18.070 --> 52:21.070
Yes, but it seems to be passing.

52:21.107 --> 52:23.207
Her fever's breaking.

52:23.342 --> 52:24.875
Whatever this illness,

52:24.877 --> 52:26.943
the drugs seem to be
doing their work.

52:26.979 --> 52:30.013
You can thank
her friend for that.

52:30.149 --> 52:32.616
What friend is that?

52:32.685 --> 52:35.218
I assumed you knew.

52:35.254 --> 52:37.020
Somebody gave her
a list of medications,

52:37.022 --> 52:40.223
and they turned out to be
exactly what she needed.

52:40.292 --> 52:42.759
So she came to see you?

52:42.762 --> 52:44.628
How did she get there?

52:44.630 --> 52:46.630
I didn't ask.

52:46.632 --> 52:47.964
But she's out of danger now?

52:48.033 --> 52:50.901
Not completely,
but there's hope,

52:50.903 --> 52:53.970
and I'd say that's all
that's really important.

52:54.039 --> 52:55.973
Wouldn't you, Tom?

52:57.810 --> 52:58.842
Tom?

53:00.445 --> 53:01.945
Right.

53:14.260 --> 53:16.260
Feel like joining us
for a drink?

53:16.262 --> 53:18.061
Margaritas are half price,

53:18.097 --> 53:19.730
and we're all feeling
a little south of the border.

53:19.732 --> 53:21.331
New England Mexican?

53:21.333 --> 53:22.999
Lobster tacos.

53:23.035 --> 53:24.701
Oh, no, you go ahead.

53:25.938 --> 53:27.337
Flowers? Jeans?

53:27.339 --> 53:31.074
Who are you and what have
you done with Brian Connor?

53:31.076 --> 53:34.144
Brian Connor is taking your advice,
living life a little slower.

53:34.213 --> 53:36.814
- No cause for alarm.
- Good.

53:38.884 --> 53:39.616
Sales are up.

53:39.685 --> 53:42.019
Morale, too, surprisingly.

53:42.021 --> 53:43.754
We're really glad you came.

53:43.756 --> 53:46.156
You don't mean that,
but, thank you.

53:46.158 --> 53:47.090
That's good to hear.

53:47.159 --> 53:48.358
Actually, I do.

53:48.394 --> 53:51.129
We were getting a little lazy
and predictable.

53:51.163 --> 53:53.429
Every shirt needs
some starch now and then.

53:53.465 --> 53:54.831
Starch...

53:54.834 --> 53:55.699
Is that what I am?

53:55.834 --> 53:56.967
Okay, bad metaphor.

53:57.036 --> 54:00.236
But I'd think you'd be
happier about all this.

54:00.272 --> 54:03.240
Look, I have a sick friend,
and I'm just,

54:03.242 --> 54:04.641
I'm waiting for news.

54:04.776 --> 54:06.710
I'm sorry about that.

54:06.712 --> 54:08.712
Me, too.

54:08.714 --> 54:09.646
Okay, boss.

54:09.715 --> 54:10.780
See you Monday.

54:10.816 --> 54:11.849
Adios!

54:13.085 --> 54:15.853
No, it's just us...

54:54.026 --> 54:56.360
Nora...

55:06.472 --> 55:08.772
Nora?

55:10.175 --> 55:11.175
Thank you.

55:12.778 --> 55:14.177
Thank god!

55:14.313 --> 55:16.179
I can't believe it.

55:16.215 --> 55:17.047
You look great.

55:17.116 --> 55:18.248
The medicines worked.

55:18.317 --> 55:19.716
My doctor doesn't know how.

55:19.785 --> 55:20.962
I can't tell you
how worried I was.

55:20.986 --> 55:21.985
I hadn't seen you.

55:21.987 --> 55:23.720
The letters stopped showing up.

55:23.789 --> 55:25.069
I didn't know what had happened.

55:25.124 --> 55:28.058
I haven't felt this good
in months.

55:28.193 --> 55:29.370
I wish there was
some way I could repay you.

55:29.394 --> 55:32.462
Actually, there is.

55:34.867 --> 55:37.867
You could tell me about this.

55:37.937 --> 55:40.336
The locket?

55:40.372 --> 55:43.874
I mean, it seems to be the thing
that brought us together.

55:43.876 --> 55:45.809
Is there some kind
of magic in it?

55:45.944 --> 55:48.945
It was my grandmother's,
and it comes with a story.

55:49.014 --> 55:52.983
- I would like to hear that story.
- All right.

55:54.520 --> 55:57.220
My family always thought
it had special powers.

55:57.289 --> 55:58.755
My grandfather
was a young doctor.

55:58.890 --> 56:00.157
He was single
and not happy about it,

56:00.159 --> 56:02.492
and one of his patients
couldn't afford to pay him

56:02.627 --> 56:05.495
and so they gave him this
in exchange,

56:05.497 --> 56:07.563
promising it would
point the way to true love.

56:07.599 --> 56:10.500
That summer,
he met a girl at a dance,

56:10.635 --> 56:12.469
and she became my grandmother.

56:14.506 --> 56:17.407
My mother wore it to the party
where she met my father.

56:19.511 --> 56:23.513
I was wearing it
when I got my first kiss.

56:30.055 --> 56:33.189
I'd like to give it
to my daughter one day,

56:33.225 --> 56:35.926
if I have one.

56:35.928 --> 56:37.127
I wish I could just...

56:37.196 --> 56:38.995
Hand it to you.

56:39.064 --> 56:42.466
It's in good hands.

56:42.468 --> 56:44.301
True love, huh?

56:46.671 --> 56:49.072
Don't tell me
there's no one in your life.

56:49.207 --> 56:52.208
No...
No, I mean, there was Julie.

56:52.277 --> 56:54.945
We were engaged
until recently, but...

56:56.048 --> 56:59.149
- What happened?
- I don't know.

56:59.151 --> 57:03.086
Maybe it was me.
Maybe it was us.

57:03.122 --> 57:05.088
Our family and friends
all expected us to marry,

57:05.124 --> 57:07.491
and we never questioned it.

57:07.626 --> 57:10.226
I mean, everybody always said,
"you're such a perfect couple".

57:10.295 --> 57:12.496
No relationship
is big enough for everyone.

57:12.498 --> 57:15.565
You can't live your life
on the expectations of others.

57:15.634 --> 57:17.200
So, what's the answer?

57:19.304 --> 57:20.664
I'm probably
not the person to ask.

57:22.508 --> 57:24.441
Look at my marriage.

57:24.576 --> 57:27.310
Yeah, you know,
that's a very good point.

57:27.312 --> 57:29.279
You ever think
about leaving him?

57:30.249 --> 57:31.581
How can I? We're married.

57:34.453 --> 57:35.919
I'm sorry.

57:36.054 --> 57:39.923
- You really are from another time.
- Marriage isn't sacred to you?

57:40.058 --> 57:41.925
Yeah...

57:42.060 --> 57:44.594
but it has to be based on
mutual respect.

57:44.630 --> 57:47.531
50-50 partnership.

57:47.666 --> 57:50.500
I mean, if you don't have that,
what do you have?

57:54.139 --> 57:55.439
I should go in.

57:56.475 --> 57:57.475
Hey, wait.

57:57.543 --> 58:00.277
Before you go,

58:00.279 --> 58:03.013
tell me about this, this garden.

58:03.148 --> 58:06.616
When you look at it,
what do you see?

58:08.420 --> 58:11.555
It's full of
the most wonderful blooms.

58:11.690 --> 58:14.224
Roses and hyacinths.

58:14.359 --> 58:17.160
Dahlias, azaleas.

58:17.196 --> 58:21.031
Summer wildflowers
with a mind of their own.

58:21.166 --> 58:23.567
Explosions of color,

58:23.702 --> 58:27.570
and when the summer air
catches it, it's like...

58:27.606 --> 58:30.440
Some amazing perfume.

58:30.442 --> 58:34.310
I wish you could smell it,
see it all through my eyes.

58:34.379 --> 58:37.180
I can.
I do, I do.

58:37.315 --> 58:40.516
It's beautiful!

58:40.552 --> 58:44.321
I honestly believe
that if I didn't have this...

58:45.657 --> 58:47.190
Nora...

59:31.236 --> 59:32.502
Hey, Mr. Connor.

59:32.571 --> 59:34.103
How'd it go, Dylan?

59:34.173 --> 59:38.708
Well, I tracked down
every directory I could find.

59:38.744 --> 59:39.576
That's every county.

59:39.578 --> 59:40.510
Good job.

59:40.512 --> 59:42.379
Just like you wanted.

59:42.381 --> 59:43.580
You really need them
for this weekend?

59:43.582 --> 59:45.582
If it wasn't important,
I wouldn't have asked,

59:45.584 --> 59:47.050
I promise.

59:47.119 --> 59:48.718
It's just,
with all the Internet access,

59:48.754 --> 59:49.764
you need those phone books?

59:49.788 --> 59:51.787
It's somebody
that I can't find on-line.

59:51.823 --> 59:54.524
Somebody that used to
live around here.

59:54.526 --> 59:55.725
It's complex.

59:55.727 --> 59:58.194
- Need a hand bringing them in?
- No, I'm good.

59:58.230 --> 01:00:00.264
I'm going to make myself a sandwich.
You want one?

01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:02.598
No, actually,
you know, I'm good.

01:00:02.634 --> 01:00:03.778
I've got plans with the lady
and everything,

01:00:03.802 --> 01:00:05.535
so I've got to get going.

01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:08.566
It's really nice to see
this place come alive again.

01:00:10.409 --> 01:00:13.276
Yeah, it is.

01:00:13.312 --> 01:00:16.746
Probably make the Sunday section,
if there was still a newspaper.

01:00:16.782 --> 01:00:18.214
I'll see you later, Mr. Connor.

01:00:18.250 --> 01:00:19.683
Thanks, Dylan.

01:00:34.132 --> 01:00:35.865
H...

01:00:37.502 --> 01:00:38.768
Hargrave, Thomas.

01:00:39.871 --> 01:00:41.504
Hargrave...

01:00:41.506 --> 01:00:43.340
Thomas.

01:00:50.515 --> 01:00:52.048
<i>Hello.</i>

01:00:52.117 --> 01:00:53.583
Mr. Hargrave?

01:00:53.718 --> 01:00:55.518
Thomas Hargrave?

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:57.254
<i>Who's calling?</i>

01:01:25.350 --> 01:01:27.350
Are you Connor?

01:01:27.485 --> 01:01:28.551
Brian Connor.

01:01:30.422 --> 01:01:32.889
- Mr. Hargrave?
- Well, thanks for meeting with me.

01:01:32.891 --> 01:01:33.690
Have a seat.

01:01:33.759 --> 01:01:36.359
Can I buy you some lunch?

01:01:36.361 --> 01:01:37.893
What's this all about?

01:01:37.929 --> 01:01:41.364
Well, I was hoping I could
talk to you about your wife.

01:01:41.499 --> 01:01:44.300
About Nora?
How would you know Nora?

01:01:44.336 --> 01:01:46.168
I don't...

01:01:46.204 --> 01:01:47.303
Exactly.

01:01:47.306 --> 01:01:48.704
It's hard to explain.

01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:51.441
Well, you brought me
all this way down here.

01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:52.510
Try.

01:01:53.912 --> 01:01:55.523
You know, is there any chance
that she's still around?

01:01:55.547 --> 01:01:57.647
Because I would love
to talk to her.

01:01:58.617 --> 01:01:59.617
Nora died years ago.

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:03.219
A lot of years.

01:02:06.625 --> 01:02:07.857
You mind telling me
how it happened?

01:02:07.859 --> 01:02:09.459
I do.

01:02:09.528 --> 01:02:12.462
What business
could it possibly be of yours?

01:02:13.965 --> 01:02:16.532
This is going to sound crazy,

01:02:16.601 --> 01:02:19.736
but I think there's a chance
that I can save Nora.

01:02:19.738 --> 01:02:21.337
Save her?

01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:23.606
You're out of your mind.
The woman's dead.

01:02:23.608 --> 01:02:28.144
I own the house, the one
you two shared back in 1960.

01:02:28.213 --> 01:02:30.281
I just bought it,
and I know things.

01:02:30.348 --> 01:02:32.415
I know things, too, Connor.

01:02:32.484 --> 01:02:34.350
I know my wife's death
was an accident.

01:02:34.386 --> 01:02:36.419
Accidents can happen.

01:02:36.421 --> 01:02:38.421
They happen
all the time around here.

01:02:38.490 --> 01:02:39.490
Good day to you.

01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:46.230
The whole story?

01:02:46.264 --> 01:02:47.542
But it's nothing but
local gossip.

01:02:47.566 --> 01:02:48.764
It's not gossip, Alana.

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:51.402
My grandfather was with the fire
department when it happened.

01:02:51.436 --> 01:02:52.702
If it hadn't been for him...

01:02:52.704 --> 01:02:54.782
Guys, can we do this one at a time
from the beginning?

01:02:54.806 --> 01:02:56.639
- I need to hear it all.
- Okay, okay.

01:02:56.775 --> 01:02:57.907
Well, the way I heard it,

01:02:57.909 --> 01:02:59.575
Hargrave was pretty much
a monster, okay?

01:02:59.611 --> 01:03:01.310
But he had
this beautiful young wife.

01:03:01.346 --> 01:03:03.379
Yeah, who was a model
from New York City.

01:03:03.382 --> 01:03:05.248
Really?

01:03:05.317 --> 01:03:06.248
Anyway, they fought
all the time.

01:03:06.284 --> 01:03:07.995
She just didn't fit in,
and she missed the city...

01:03:08.019 --> 01:03:09.319
but I heard it was Miami.

01:03:09.454 --> 01:03:11.720
- She'd married him for his money.
- You sure about that?

01:03:11.757 --> 01:03:13.389
Totally.
Ask anybody.

01:03:13.392 --> 01:03:14.952
A string of boyfriends
on the side, too.

01:03:15.861 --> 01:03:17.527
But that doesn't
excuse what happened.

01:03:17.529 --> 01:03:18.806
Just get to
the good stuff, all right?

01:03:18.830 --> 01:03:19.830
Hey, you know what?

01:03:19.865 --> 01:03:21.597
Here, I'm going to
bring up an article.

01:03:21.633 --> 01:03:22.732
Give me a second here.

01:03:22.734 --> 01:03:24.868
Anyway, the husband was always
taking his bad moods out on her,

01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:27.537
so one night she finally
decides to leave the guy,

01:03:27.539 --> 01:03:28.783
just pack up
and get out of there,

01:03:28.807 --> 01:03:31.608
but the husband gets wind of it
and locks her in her room.

01:03:31.743 --> 01:03:33.276
Then he sets the house on fire,
with her in it.

01:03:33.278 --> 01:03:34.477
My god.

01:03:34.546 --> 01:03:35.757
Why didn't you tell me that
from the beginning?

01:03:35.781 --> 01:03:37.347
It didn't seem
important, I guess.

01:03:37.482 --> 01:03:38.414
It's ancient history...

01:03:38.450 --> 01:03:40.282
Okay, I got it.

01:03:40.318 --> 01:03:41.350
Here.

01:03:41.386 --> 01:03:43.219
Hey, isn't this your new place?

01:03:43.354 --> 01:03:46.021
Well, obviously,
the whole house didn't burn down,

01:03:46.057 --> 01:03:47.937
just the bedroom, her room,
and ever since then,

01:03:48.026 --> 01:03:52.027
people say that when the wind is still
and the moon is full, every...

01:03:54.432 --> 01:03:56.031
Julie!

01:03:56.067 --> 01:03:57.700
Hi.

01:03:57.702 --> 01:03:59.368
I thought that you were...

01:03:59.404 --> 01:04:00.415
My friend's wedding, yeah.

01:04:00.439 --> 01:04:02.438
It was in New York.

01:04:02.474 --> 01:04:03.474
Didn't I mention that?

01:04:03.508 --> 01:04:05.441
- No.
- No?

01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:07.845
Well, I realized
I had never seen Maine before,

01:04:07.913 --> 01:04:08.956
and since I was in the area,

01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:11.548
I figured I'd stop by
and check everyth...

01:04:13.685 --> 01:04:16.786
Is there somewhere a little bit
more private that we can talk?

01:04:16.855 --> 01:04:17.987
Yeah, my office is this way.

01:04:19.858 --> 01:04:20.990
Hi.

01:04:21.993 --> 01:04:23.326
That's the ex-fiancee.

01:04:23.328 --> 01:04:24.928
Who's the blonde?

01:04:24.930 --> 01:04:26.463
She's really pretty.

01:04:26.564 --> 01:04:27.530
Is that the one you're seeing?

01:04:27.566 --> 01:04:28.664
Alana? No!

01:04:28.733 --> 01:04:29.732
No, that...

01:04:29.734 --> 01:04:33.269
So, hey, what a surprise.

01:04:33.404 --> 01:04:35.872
I had to see you.

01:04:35.941 --> 01:04:37.941
I don't like
the way things ended.

01:04:38.076 --> 01:04:39.076
Neither do I.

01:04:39.143 --> 01:04:40.409
For the record.

01:04:40.479 --> 01:04:42.611
My parents weren't too pleased
about it either.

01:04:42.647 --> 01:04:45.048
You didn't only do this
to me, Brian...

01:04:46.685 --> 01:04:47.685
I'm sorry.

01:04:47.819 --> 01:04:49.552
I promised myself
I wouldn't go there.

01:04:49.588 --> 01:04:51.820
Hey, look, it's all right.

01:04:51.857 --> 01:04:53.756
This was all my fault.

01:04:53.758 --> 01:04:54.690
Good.

01:04:54.759 --> 01:04:56.239
Well, at least
we're on the same page.

01:04:57.729 --> 01:04:59.962
Look, I...

01:04:59.998 --> 01:05:02.910
I got a room down at the B&B,
and I don't have to go right home,

01:05:02.934 --> 01:05:05.568
so it's up to you,
I mean, if you wanted...

01:05:05.604 --> 01:05:07.770
If you wanted, we could talk.

01:05:07.839 --> 01:05:10.840
- I mean, I could come see your place.
- You want to come see my new place?

01:05:10.842 --> 01:05:14.191
Yeah, of course, unless there's
some reason why I shouldn't.

01:05:14.913 --> 01:05:16.846
No, it's...
No, there's not.

01:05:16.848 --> 01:05:18.893
No, I'm just,
in the middle of remodeling it.

01:05:18.917 --> 01:05:20.717
It's not really
ready for company...

01:05:20.719 --> 01:05:22.619
So? I don't care.
I want to see it.

01:05:24.055 --> 01:05:26.656
Come on, I'll even bring dinner.

01:05:33.798 --> 01:05:34.898
This fork is dirty.

01:05:38.803 --> 01:05:39.803
I'll get a new one.

01:05:45.677 --> 01:05:46.943
So, what did you do today?

01:05:47.078 --> 01:05:50.412
I did laundry, fixed dinner.

01:05:50.448 --> 01:05:52.014
You're not wearing your locket.

01:05:52.050 --> 01:05:53.050
I'm guessing that means

01:05:53.084 --> 01:05:54.524
that you haven't
seen that man again.

01:05:56.855 --> 01:05:58.888
That was in my head.

01:05:58.890 --> 01:05:59.890
The fever.

01:06:01.927 --> 01:06:03.426
Mr. Clemens?

01:06:03.428 --> 01:06:04.560
Has he been around?

01:06:04.596 --> 01:06:06.829
Not that I know of.

01:06:06.865 --> 01:06:08.030
He makes his own schedule.

01:06:08.066 --> 01:06:10.600
So, no more medical advice then?

01:06:12.070 --> 01:06:13.569
Frank's a handyman.

01:06:13.638 --> 01:06:14.758
What would he know about it?

01:06:18.076 --> 01:06:19.076
I'll get that.

01:06:20.612 --> 01:06:22.078
No, let me.

01:06:37.128 --> 01:06:38.795
Mr. Hargrave.

01:06:38.797 --> 01:06:42.197
I'm so sorry to bother you
at this hour.

01:06:42.233 --> 01:06:44.701
It's just that it's the only time
I can catch you lately.

01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:46.936
What is it?

01:06:46.938 --> 01:06:48.871
Well, I'd like to finish
the arbor this week,

01:06:48.907 --> 01:06:50.006
but I'll need a check

01:06:50.008 --> 01:06:53.676
to cover the balance
of the materials.

01:07:01.086 --> 01:07:03.486
Look, all I need is the check.

01:07:03.555 --> 01:07:06.055
Even part'll do, if you don't
have it all right now.

01:07:07.825 --> 01:07:09.092
Nora was telling me

01:07:09.094 --> 01:07:11.160
that you were the one
behind the medication.

01:07:11.196 --> 01:07:12.206
That you gave her that list.

01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:14.631
She couldn't have told you that.

01:07:14.732 --> 01:07:15.631
It's not true.

01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:18.835
But you did drive her into town
to the doctor?

01:07:18.837 --> 01:07:19.702
Yes, sir.

01:07:19.738 --> 01:07:23.105
You were off in Portland
and she needed a ride.

01:07:23.174 --> 01:07:28.044
It's not fair that she's stuck
out here away from everything.

01:07:28.046 --> 01:07:29.245
That's none of your concern.

01:07:33.851 --> 01:07:37.920
Thomas,
your dinner's getting cold.

01:07:37.989 --> 01:07:40.623
Quiet, Nora.

01:07:44.162 --> 01:07:47.530
You need...
To stay away from my wife.

01:07:47.599 --> 01:07:51.267
You know, she's a special lady,

01:07:51.269 --> 01:07:52.869
and I'm not sure
you appreciate that...

01:07:52.871 --> 01:07:55.872
I don't need you telling me
how to run my household.

01:07:58.009 --> 01:07:59.475
Stop it!

01:07:59.610 --> 01:08:01.143
What is wrong
with you? Stop it!

01:08:01.212 --> 01:08:02.344
You're insane.

01:08:02.414 --> 01:08:03.891
Get out of here, you hear me?
You never come back!

01:08:03.915 --> 01:08:04.747
You hear me?

01:08:04.816 --> 01:08:06.616
Yeah, I hear you, okay?

01:08:06.618 --> 01:08:07.728
I think maybe
your wife does, too.

01:08:07.752 --> 01:08:08.751
Stop it!

01:08:08.753 --> 01:08:09.552
Stop it...

01:08:09.621 --> 01:08:10.953
Nora, you get in the house!

01:08:10.989 --> 01:08:11.954
No!

01:08:11.956 --> 01:08:12.822
I said...

01:08:12.957 --> 01:08:13.823
I heard what you said,
and I said no!

01:08:13.825 --> 01:08:15.625
Go have your dinner.

01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:16.760
Go! Go!

01:08:16.828 --> 01:08:18.094
Well, go!

01:08:18.095 --> 01:08:19.629
Suit yourself.

01:08:49.728 --> 01:08:51.660
Okay, so, dining room,

01:08:51.696 --> 01:08:56.198
and this is the kitchen.

01:08:59.069 --> 01:09:00.536
Fresh flowers?

01:09:02.607 --> 01:09:03.973
Not you.

01:09:05.276 --> 01:09:06.809
They're from a friend.

01:09:10.648 --> 01:09:12.680
Well, this was
the best I could do.

01:09:12.751 --> 01:09:14.750
Not much in the way of
fine dining in this town.

01:09:14.786 --> 01:09:17.286
Brian, can you get me
the plates, please?

01:09:17.421 --> 01:09:18.554
Yeah.

01:09:18.622 --> 01:09:20.890
Well, you know,
take-out Chinese,

01:09:21.024 --> 01:09:22.758
I like it.

01:09:22.794 --> 01:09:23.959
Really?

01:09:23.995 --> 01:09:26.295
Gosh, that's weird.

01:09:26.363 --> 01:09:27.630
It's weird

01:09:27.631 --> 01:09:30.832
because you used to be the king
of four-star restaurants.

01:09:30.835 --> 01:09:34.703
You know, I'm not as much
into that as I used to be.

01:09:34.773 --> 01:09:36.973
You know, actually,
I don't think I ever was.

01:09:36.975 --> 01:09:38.307
It was Stan and Vicki.

01:09:38.309 --> 01:09:40.375
You know, Taylor,
they were the ones

01:09:40.411 --> 01:09:41.721
who were into
the latest and greatest.

01:09:41.746 --> 01:09:45.180
I just tagged along,
did what was expected of me.

01:09:45.216 --> 01:09:47.149
Was I one of those expectations?

01:09:48.653 --> 01:09:50.319
That's how it started to feel.

01:09:50.321 --> 01:09:52.233
Like we were together
'cause we were supposed to be,

01:09:52.256 --> 01:09:53.990
not 'cause we wanted to be.

01:09:54.125 --> 01:09:56.192
Really, because
I never felt like I was...

01:09:56.194 --> 01:09:58.861
Filling some obligation
when I was with you.

01:09:58.930 --> 01:10:02.131
- You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

01:10:02.266 --> 01:10:05.935
Because in the beginning,
it was fun, but I just...

01:10:05.937 --> 01:10:07.269
I don't know, you know?

01:10:07.338 --> 01:10:09.071
We started living
such different lives.

01:10:09.207 --> 01:10:12.074
You wanted parties,
and restaurants, art openings...

01:10:12.076 --> 01:10:13.009
Really?
And what did you want?

01:10:13.011 --> 01:10:16.212
Surprisingly, I think...

01:10:16.281 --> 01:10:17.281
This.

01:10:17.348 --> 01:10:20.616
This house is...

01:10:20.685 --> 01:10:21.851
Or something like it.

01:10:24.222 --> 01:10:25.688
Yeah...

01:10:25.757 --> 01:10:27.317
Yeah, I'm going to go
and wash up, okay?

01:10:27.358 --> 01:10:30.259
If you need anything,
just shout.

01:11:24.515 --> 01:11:25.748
Nora, are you all right?

01:11:28.887 --> 01:11:31.754
I hate him.

01:11:31.756 --> 01:11:32.688
You don't know...

01:11:32.757 --> 01:11:35.691
Actually, I do.
I met him this week.

01:11:35.826 --> 01:11:37.226
Thomas? Where?
How could that happen?

01:11:37.228 --> 01:11:42.365
He's old, he's frail, but he's still
everything you've told me.

01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:43.299
Nora...

01:11:43.434 --> 01:11:46.234
You need to get out.

01:11:46.271 --> 01:11:47.271
You need to leave.

01:11:47.305 --> 01:11:49.105
Why, what do you know?

01:11:50.775 --> 01:11:52.908
I know that it's not safe
for you to stay.

01:11:52.944 --> 01:11:54.043
Here?

01:11:54.045 --> 01:11:56.045
But this is my home.
He's my husband.

01:11:56.114 --> 01:11:59.448
- We have our problems, but...
- Nora, you need to leave.

01:11:59.583 --> 01:12:02.918
You're frightening me.

01:12:02.954 --> 01:12:05.187
You know something.

01:12:05.323 --> 01:12:08.090
Do you?

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:10.459
Am I going to die?

01:12:10.528 --> 01:12:13.195
I read a newspaper article
on the Internet.

01:12:13.331 --> 01:12:16.332
- The what?
- How do I explain this?

01:12:16.401 --> 01:12:21.337
It's like a personal library with old
articles, magazines, newspapers,

01:12:21.472 --> 01:12:24.473
and there was an article
about a fire here at the house.

01:12:24.475 --> 01:12:27.409
- But there's been no fire here.
- Not yet.

01:12:27.478 --> 01:12:29.545
When?

01:12:31.349 --> 01:12:34.216
- Is that how I...
- It doesn't have to be.

01:12:34.218 --> 01:12:36.130
I think that's why we met,
so that I could warn you...

01:12:36.154 --> 01:12:37.953
But if it's already happened...

01:12:38.022 --> 01:12:39.466
No! Nora, listen,
you've got to pack your things

01:12:39.490 --> 01:12:40.489
and you've got to leave.

01:12:40.491 --> 01:12:42.091
- What, just like that?
- Just like that.

01:12:42.093 --> 01:12:46.028
Thomas is a lot of things,
but he's my husband.

01:12:46.064 --> 01:12:48.296
He doesn't act like it.

01:12:48.333 --> 01:12:49.476
You told me that
in all of your letters.

01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:51.200
Still, I...

01:12:51.202 --> 01:12:54.236
No, listen, I was right
about the medicine, wasn't I?

01:12:54.238 --> 01:12:55.482
You've got to trust me
one more time.

01:12:55.506 --> 01:12:57.173
All right, you've got
to go in there,

01:12:57.175 --> 01:12:59.975
and you've got to pack your things,
Nora, and you've got to leave, now.

01:13:01.245 --> 01:13:02.245
Please?

01:13:02.313 --> 01:13:04.280
Do you trust me?

01:13:05.450 --> 01:13:07.382
Yes.

01:13:07.418 --> 01:13:09.251
I absolutely do.

01:13:09.287 --> 01:13:11.320
Okay.

01:13:11.389 --> 01:13:14.589
Brian, if things were different,

01:13:14.625 --> 01:13:18.327
if time were on our side...

01:13:26.404 --> 01:13:28.971
Do you feel that?

01:13:31.142 --> 01:13:32.142
I'm beginning to feel

01:13:32.209 --> 01:13:35.277
that if you care about
someone enough,

01:13:35.413 --> 01:13:36.645
time doesn't mean a thing.

01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:41.417
I wish that that were true.

01:13:45.023 --> 01:13:47.223
Nora! Nora!

01:13:51.496 --> 01:13:52.528
I should go.

01:14:11.982 --> 01:14:14.316
What took you so long?

01:14:14.385 --> 01:14:16.052
Where are you going?

01:14:54.024 --> 01:14:55.624
"True love"?

01:14:57.261 --> 01:14:59.028
Well, that's not
your taste, Brian.

01:14:59.030 --> 01:15:01.430
This was something
your friend left behind.

01:15:09.974 --> 01:15:11.874
What do you think you're doing?

01:15:11.876 --> 01:15:14.409
You're a smart man, Thomas.

01:15:14.478 --> 01:15:15.978
A suitcase, clothes?

01:15:17.415 --> 01:15:18.855
Don't think
you're going to leave me.

01:15:18.882 --> 01:15:20.215
It's not up for discussion.

01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:22.884
I need to get
away from here, from you.

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:24.286
I need to clear my head.

01:15:24.288 --> 01:15:25.354
Think you're going to
embarrass me?

01:15:25.356 --> 01:15:26.356
Well, I won't allow it!

01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:29.626
I've had more than enough of
your rules and your suspicions.

01:15:29.693 --> 01:15:31.493
- Put this down!
- No!

01:15:31.562 --> 01:15:32.761
No!

01:15:36.901 --> 01:15:37.901
No!

01:15:38.502 --> 01:15:40.035
Open this door.

01:15:40.037 --> 01:15:43.439
Thomas, you can't
keep me locked in here!

01:15:43.574 --> 01:15:46.308
You don't tell me what to do!
It's my house!

01:15:46.310 --> 01:15:47.242
I make the rules!

01:15:47.311 --> 01:15:50.645
Thomas, please, open the door.

01:15:50.681 --> 01:15:51.980
Thomas!

01:15:53.717 --> 01:15:54.850
Let me out, let me out!

01:15:55.986 --> 01:15:58.520
Thomas?

01:16:00.791 --> 01:16:02.324
No.

01:16:02.393 --> 01:16:04.326
Open this door!

01:16:04.395 --> 01:16:05.794
Please!

01:16:05.796 --> 01:16:08.330
Thomas, let me out!

01:16:08.332 --> 01:16:10.465
Let me out...

01:16:11.602 --> 01:16:14.069
Thomas!

01:16:14.071 --> 01:16:17.406
Open this door, please!

01:16:17.408 --> 01:16:18.941
Thomas, you have to!

01:16:19.076 --> 01:16:20.976
Open this door!

01:16:26.083 --> 01:16:28.283
Who the hell are you?

01:16:28.418 --> 01:16:29.617
Hargrave?

01:16:29.653 --> 01:16:30.685
Get out of my house!

01:16:30.721 --> 01:16:31.887
Where's Nora?

01:16:32.022 --> 01:16:33.467
She's safe enough...
how do you know my wife?

01:16:33.491 --> 01:16:34.623
Let me out!

01:16:34.625 --> 01:16:35.735
So all the stories are true.

01:16:35.759 --> 01:16:38.137
You saved yourself and
you left her up there to die.

01:16:38.161 --> 01:16:39.695
Not this time!

01:16:45.035 --> 01:16:46.902
Nora!

01:16:46.904 --> 01:16:47.703
Are you in there?

01:16:47.705 --> 01:16:48.836
Brian?

01:16:48.873 --> 01:16:49.873
I have to get you out.

01:16:49.907 --> 01:16:50.973
There's a fire!

01:16:51.108 --> 01:16:52.040
He's locked the door!

01:16:52.076 --> 01:16:53.675
You need a key.
Thomas has it.

01:17:22.506 --> 01:17:24.072
Brian!

01:17:29.747 --> 01:17:30.846
Stay with me.

01:17:35.152 --> 01:17:36.152
Stop!

01:17:37.688 --> 01:17:38.753
Let her go.

01:17:38.789 --> 01:17:40.689
You both have to leave.

01:17:40.691 --> 01:17:43.358
I will not be made a fool of!

01:17:43.427 --> 01:17:44.493
No one's going anywhere!

01:17:44.628 --> 01:17:46.428
Put the gun down.
We need to get out of here.

01:17:46.497 --> 01:17:49.218
Is this someone else you've
been seeing behind my back?

01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:52.901
Get out, Nora.
Go. Now!

01:17:53.036 --> 01:17:54.536
I won't leave you here!

01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:57.839
It was you the whole time,
wasn't it?

01:17:57.875 --> 01:17:59.508
You don't understand...

01:18:04.014 --> 01:18:05.714
Please, please, Thomas,
don't do this.

01:18:07.184 --> 01:18:09.384
You have to put the gun down.

01:18:09.453 --> 01:18:11.654
If you don't leave this house,
you're going to die.

01:18:16.794 --> 01:18:18.727
Thomas, don't!

01:18:18.796 --> 01:18:20.028
What's happening?

01:18:28.138 --> 01:18:29.604
Julie, what did you do?

01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:31.540
For god's sakes,
what did you do?

01:18:32.943 --> 01:18:33.943
I found her locket.

01:18:34.011 --> 01:18:37.012
It slipped out of my hand
and fell into the fireplace.

01:18:37.014 --> 01:18:38.647
I'm sorry.

01:18:46.090 --> 01:18:49.157
But is she the real reason
why you came here?

01:18:50.594 --> 01:18:52.026
Why you left?

01:18:52.062 --> 01:18:55.063
You have no idea
what you've done.

01:18:58.702 --> 01:19:00.680
- You can tell me about her.
- I wouldn't know where to start.

01:19:00.704 --> 01:19:02.704
Well, we're friends,
friends talk.

01:19:02.839 --> 01:19:05.106
- Is that hers?
- It's an heirloom.

01:19:05.142 --> 01:19:07.921
The story is, that it has
the ability to point to true love.

01:19:07.945 --> 01:19:09.510
True love?

01:19:09.546 --> 01:19:10.979
Are you kidding me?
Are you serious?

01:19:11.114 --> 01:19:13.281
Look, there's
a connection, but it's...

01:19:14.618 --> 01:19:16.651
I really can't explain this.

01:19:16.654 --> 01:19:18.053
Yeah, I can see that,

01:19:18.188 --> 01:19:20.522
and I think I should probably
call it a night

01:19:20.524 --> 01:19:22.123
because I have
an early plane tomorrow.

01:19:22.192 --> 01:19:26.060
You can call me tomorrow
if you want, but I...

01:19:26.096 --> 01:19:27.807
Yeah, I seriously doubt
that's going to happen.

01:19:27.831 --> 01:19:29.799
- Julie, you know...
- What?

01:19:29.933 --> 01:19:30.977
If we're going to be
honest with each other,

01:19:31.001 --> 01:19:32.311
look, I think we need
to confront the fact

01:19:32.335 --> 01:19:37.873
I don't think that this relationship
is what either one of us wants.

01:19:37.875 --> 01:19:40.809
Well, you might be right,
if we were being honest,

01:19:40.811 --> 01:19:43.745
but after all these years,
why start now?

01:19:43.747 --> 01:19:45.747
Hey, look...

01:19:47.551 --> 01:19:48.628
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

01:19:48.652 --> 01:19:50.085
Yeah, you too.

01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:54.155
I mean, whatever it is,
if it's her, then...

01:19:54.224 --> 01:19:56.758
Then that, too.

01:20:24.922 --> 01:20:26.254
Okay, come on.

01:20:26.389 --> 01:20:28.190
Come on...

01:20:33.664 --> 01:20:35.063
Thomas.

01:20:45.208 --> 01:20:46.941
Nora?

01:20:46.977 --> 01:20:49.544
Oh, my god...

01:20:49.613 --> 01:20:50.779
We changed history.

01:21:14.971 --> 01:21:16.238
Looking for someone?

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:17.839
Nora Hargrave.

01:21:17.908 --> 01:21:19.640
Hargrave, I don't
know about that,

01:21:19.676 --> 01:21:22.177
but Nora, yes.

01:21:22.312 --> 01:21:24.646
She was taken to
East hills nursing home

01:21:24.648 --> 01:21:26.381
a few weeks ago, poor thing.

01:21:26.383 --> 01:21:29.785
I'm sure she'd
appreciate a visit.

01:22:15.832 --> 01:22:17.899
Those are beautiful.

01:22:27.845 --> 01:22:29.711
It's... it's you, isn't it?

01:22:29.846 --> 01:22:31.780
Yeah, it's me.

01:22:31.782 --> 01:22:34.115
Hi, Nora.

01:22:34.251 --> 01:22:36.117
I knew you'd come.

01:22:36.253 --> 01:22:38.253
Sorry it took me so long.

01:22:38.388 --> 01:22:42.123
What's 50 years between friends?

01:22:42.259 --> 01:22:43.791
Those are for me?

01:22:45.262 --> 01:22:48.262
They're from our garden.

01:22:48.298 --> 01:22:50.999
They're lovely.

01:22:51.068 --> 01:22:54.402
So, you brought it back,
did you?

01:22:54.537 --> 01:22:57.072
It's back, however it happened.

01:22:57.207 --> 01:23:00.075
You would be very proud.

01:23:00.077 --> 01:23:02.143
I can't believe it's you.

01:23:02.279 --> 01:23:03.311
Well, lucky for me...

01:23:05.215 --> 01:23:07.748
I can prove it.

01:23:08.452 --> 01:23:11.485
My locket.

01:23:11.521 --> 01:23:15.156
Oh, my.

01:23:15.158 --> 01:23:19.093
I was beginning to think
I'd never see it again.

01:23:19.129 --> 01:23:21.763
Hey, that's not like you.

01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:24.099
How are you doing?

01:23:24.101 --> 01:23:26.901
Well, look at me.

01:23:26.970 --> 01:23:29.304
I'm old.

01:23:29.306 --> 01:23:34.308
I'm not well, and, this time,

01:23:34.344 --> 01:23:37.979
I don't even think this locket
has enough magic to change that.

01:23:37.981 --> 01:23:40.448
It surprised us last time.

01:23:40.583 --> 01:23:41.783
Is that my husband?

01:23:43.053 --> 01:23:45.053
Your husband?

01:23:45.055 --> 01:23:49.924
Frank, this is my friend, Brian.

01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:51.792
Brian?

01:23:51.828 --> 01:23:54.462
My wife's told me all about you
through the years.

01:23:54.597 --> 01:23:58.066
I mean, she thinks if it weren't
for you, she wouldn't be here.

01:23:58.201 --> 01:23:59.245
And you believed that story?

01:23:59.269 --> 01:24:03.871
Well, it's important
that Nora believed it.

01:24:03.941 --> 01:24:06.007
Wait, so, you got remarried,

01:24:06.009 --> 01:24:08.543
but you were still listed
under Hargrave, why?

01:24:08.545 --> 01:24:11.813
I always hoped you'd come
looking for me one day.

01:24:11.948 --> 01:24:16.418
A lot of Noras to sort through
in New England, I imagine.

01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:19.220
Grandpa?

01:24:20.490 --> 01:24:23.091
There's someone you need
to meet, Brian Connor.

01:24:24.161 --> 01:24:25.161
My granddaughter.

01:24:25.195 --> 01:24:27.262
Sarah?

01:24:33.904 --> 01:24:34.969
It's a pleasure.

01:24:34.972 --> 01:24:36.371
Brian Connor?

01:24:36.506 --> 01:24:37.506
<i>The Brian Connor?</i>

01:24:37.574 --> 01:24:39.840
Didn't I tell you he'd be back?

01:24:41.478 --> 01:24:42.844
Quite a resemblance, huh?

01:24:42.913 --> 01:24:44.579
Remarkable.

01:24:44.581 --> 01:24:48.516
He brought me flowers, Sarah,

01:24:48.552 --> 01:24:52.220
and something I've been hoping
to give you one day.

01:24:52.222 --> 01:24:53.321
Is that it?

01:24:53.456 --> 01:24:55.589
I've only seen it in pictures.

01:24:55.625 --> 01:24:57.992
Help her with that,
will you, Brian?

01:24:58.028 --> 01:24:58.926
Yeah.

01:24:58.962 --> 01:24:59.995
Thank you.

01:25:00.130 --> 01:25:02.797
As it happens, there's a story
that goes along with it.

01:25:02.932 --> 01:25:05.200
Yes, grandma, you've told me.

01:25:05.335 --> 01:25:06.434
But it's a good one.

01:25:07.904 --> 01:25:11.406
Share it with Brian,
will you, dear?

01:25:11.475 --> 01:25:13.475
You feel like
a walk in the garden?

01:25:13.610 --> 01:25:15.276
Always.

01:25:24.054 --> 01:25:27.422
I loved you back then, you know.

01:25:27.491 --> 01:25:29.557
All those years.

01:25:29.559 --> 01:25:33.509
I loved you, too,
but it doesn't seem all that long ago.

01:25:34.631 --> 01:25:37.432
Not to you, I suppose.

01:25:37.501 --> 01:25:41.202
Me, I've lived
a lifetime since then...

01:25:42.472 --> 01:25:47.242
A wonderful, happy lifetime,
all thanks to you.

01:25:48.979 --> 01:25:50.512
Now it's your turn.

01:25:50.514 --> 01:25:52.113
So go on,

01:25:52.182 --> 01:25:55.649
take that walk,

01:25:55.685 --> 01:25:57.619
see where it takes you.

01:26:04.461 --> 01:26:05.593
We won't be far.

01:26:05.595 --> 01:26:08.062
Neither will I, Brian Connor.

01:26:09.666 --> 01:26:12.000
Neither will I.
