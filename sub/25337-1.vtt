<i>Once upon a time,
in the not-too-distant future,</i>

02:07.301 --> 02:09.103
<i>America was at war with itself.</i>

02:10.804 --> 02:13.206
<i>Our political parties
had fallen into crisis.</i>

02:13.941 --> 02:15.276
<i>An identity crisis.</i>

02:17.044 --> 02:18.546
<i>And where there is war,</i>

02:19.145 --> 02:20.247
<i>there are soldiers.</i>

02:23.616 --> 02:24.782
[man grunting]

02:24.784 --> 02:25.986
<i>And where there are soldiers,</i>

02:27.653 --> 02:28.889
<i>there are casualties.</i>

02:35.162 --> 02:37.629
<i>Mary Maple was once
the Magnolia Queen.</i>

02:37.631 --> 02:38.966
Yes, it's me.

02:42.269 --> 02:44.001
- <i>Michael.</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

02:44.003 --> 02:45.939
Tell me about yourself,
what's your background?

02:46.139 --> 02:47.275
Where'd you go to school?

02:47.841 --> 02:49.340
I graduated from GW.

02:49.342 --> 02:51.342
Hmm. What did
you major in?

02:51.344 --> 02:53.881
Political Science with
a minor in Journalism.

02:54.681 --> 02:55.582
What kind of grades?

02:56.216 --> 02:57.617
Graduated with honors.

02:57.850 --> 02:58.752
Cum laude.

02:59.019 --> 03:00.185
Cum laude.

03:00.187 --> 03:01.222
My goodness.

03:02.155 --> 03:04.191
- Sugar?
- Oh, yes please.

03:04.625 --> 03:06.156
[Michael] <i>Mary Maple.</i>

03:06.158 --> 03:07.995
<i>A very good person
to know in Washington.</i>

03:08.829 --> 03:10.298
So, how can I
help you, Michael?

03:11.764 --> 03:13.231
Well, it's pretty clear
that Senator Baines

03:13.233 --> 03:14.634
is gonna run for president.

03:16.302 --> 03:18.639
If I can be anywhere
near that, I mean...

03:20.907 --> 03:22.276
I could learn a lot
from the man.

03:23.909 --> 03:25.947
Well, John is a good friend.

03:26.780 --> 03:29.283
- Nothing is set in stone, of course.
- No, no, of course.

03:29.782 --> 03:32.250
Rob Reynolds is unofficially
running the campaign.

03:32.252 --> 03:34.886
I have heard of him, although I
haven't made his acquaintance.

03:34.888 --> 03:37.024
Rob is also
a good friend.

03:37.691 --> 03:38.693
He's the best at what he does.

03:38.959 --> 03:40.294
Yes, he is.

03:47.933 --> 03:51.102
Consider yourself invited to
the Maple Foundation event,

03:51.104 --> 03:54.809
where my good friend John Boland
Baines is our guest speaker.

03:55.741 --> 03:58.812
I'll even introduce you
to Rob Reynolds myself.

04:01.381 --> 04:03.818
I'd very much appreciate that, Mrs.
Maple.

04:05.051 --> 04:06.287
Call me Mary.

04:07.753 --> 04:09.721
Oh! My goodness!

04:09.723 --> 04:12.056
Oh! My goodness!

04:12.058 --> 04:15.793
Oh! My! Oh, darlin'! Michael!

04:15.795 --> 04:17.796
Darlin', I need you...
I need you...

04:17.798 --> 04:19.199
I need you to stop
for a minute.

04:20.966 --> 04:24.871
Oh. Oh. Oh.

04:26.807 --> 04:27.908
[Mary sighs]

04:31.444 --> 04:32.747
[sighs]

04:37.350 --> 04:38.919
- Hey.
- What?

04:39.119 --> 04:41.385
Where'd you go?
I'm in here.

04:41.387 --> 04:43.289
[chuckles]

04:53.233 --> 04:54.701
You know, I like you
better without it.

04:55.367 --> 04:56.968
You mean you
don't like my wig?

04:56.970 --> 04:58.372
No, no, no.
I like your wig.

04:59.206 --> 05:00.374
I mean, here.

05:00.906 --> 05:01.975
Now.

05:05.045 --> 05:06.112
I like you like this.

05:07.848 --> 05:09.817
[sighs] You do?

05:11.785 --> 05:14.786
Oh, sugar, you really
are something.

05:14.788 --> 05:16.122
[both chuckling]

05:17.023 --> 05:18.522
[moaning]

05:18.524 --> 05:21.161
Oh! Oh!

05:22.161 --> 05:24.097
[moaning loudly]

05:31.904 --> 05:34.072
[Michael] <i>A little over a
year ago, at a lunch counter,</i>

05:34.074 --> 05:36.173
<i>my boss,
Senator Lester Garret,</i>

05:36.175 --> 05:38.012
<i>told me he had a pain
in his abdomen.</i>

05:39.346 --> 05:42.716
<i>Less than two months later,
Lester died of pancreatic cancer.</i>

05:43.983 --> 05:45.485
<i>I'd been out of work
ever since.</i>

05:46.552 --> 05:48.021
<i>I had to make something happen.</i>

05:48.788 --> 05:51.324
<i>I was on borrowed time
in a borrowed SUV.</i>

06:03.435 --> 06:04.871
That Judge Karl?

06:06.372 --> 06:07.474
How did you get this?

06:08.541 --> 06:11.308
Callie, Judge Karl
has a wife and kids.

06:11.310 --> 06:12.810
Precisely.

06:12.812 --> 06:14.913
And he's been
a judicial activist

06:14.915 --> 06:17.514
against same-sex marriage
for his entire career.

06:17.516 --> 06:20.517
Some of his legal language was
actually in DOMA, for Christ's sakes.

06:20.519 --> 06:24.154
I mean, he's a hypocrite
of the highest order.

06:24.156 --> 06:26.926
[Michael] <i>Callie and I met when we
were both interning for Lester.</i>

06:27.293 --> 06:29.896
Yeah, but, Callie...

06:31.230 --> 06:32.132
wife and kids.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.300
Yeah, you're right, I can't
do that to the wife and kids.

06:36.302 --> 06:39.336
[Michael] <i>She's my roommate and
my best friend. But lately...</i>

06:39.338 --> 06:40.240
I'll blackmail him.

06:41.608 --> 06:43.009
How much do you think
we would get?

06:44.110 --> 06:45.211
Not much, honestly.

06:45.911 --> 06:47.512
[scoffs]

06:47.514 --> 06:49.150
[Michael] <i>She had quite
a collection going.</i>

06:50.483 --> 06:51.851
<i>Most of those guys weren't
exactly big players, though.</i>

06:52.485 --> 06:53.888
<i>The judge tape...</i>

06:54.086 --> 06:55.389
<i>This was different.</i>

06:56.255 --> 06:58.992
You know,
in this little box...

07:00.526 --> 07:02.159
is the real DC.

07:02.161 --> 07:03.560
Yeah, and it's going to
stay in that box.

07:03.562 --> 07:04.865
For a rainy day.

07:05.398 --> 07:06.500
Speaking of rainy days...

07:07.067 --> 07:09.033
umm, how we doing on rent?

07:09.035 --> 07:11.071
[sighs] 'Cause, uh,
that's a final notice.

07:11.403 --> 07:14.574
Yeah, we're probably going to
have to bust out the umbrellas.

07:15.175 --> 07:16.110
Really?

07:18.345 --> 07:19.246
[clears throat]

07:19.913 --> 07:22.079
That was a gift
from Tanya.

07:22.081 --> 07:24.182
Oh, how nice of her.

07:24.184 --> 07:25.617
Did you ever consider
selling the coke?

07:25.619 --> 07:28.485
Michael, I can't
sell a gift.

07:28.487 --> 07:30.255
We have to pay rent.

07:30.257 --> 07:31.458
I know.

07:32.024 --> 07:35.862
[sighs] Whatever are we to do?

07:53.213 --> 07:55.015
[Michael] <i>This is
my friend Kevin Bidwell,</i>

07:55.247 --> 07:58.082
<i>noted political journalist
for a noted political newspaper</i>

07:58.084 --> 07:59.954
<i>whose circulation
was way down.</i>

08:00.452 --> 08:01.485
Who you fuckin'?
[laughs]

08:01.487 --> 08:03.521
[Michael] <i>Kevin Bidwell,</i>

08:03.523 --> 08:04.923
<i>former college roommate who
lived vicariously through me.</i>

08:04.925 --> 08:07.093
I wanna work
for John Baines.

08:08.194 --> 08:10.428
I want a rim job
from Ann Coulter,

08:10.430 --> 08:12.430
but that doesn't mean
it's gonna happen.

08:12.432 --> 08:14.134
[Michael] <i>It was like college
had never ended for Kevin.</i>

08:14.701 --> 08:16.433
All right, so what is it
you actually want, Michael?

08:16.435 --> 08:17.904
I mean, let's say you...

08:18.103 --> 08:20.306
you get the job,
and Baines became president?

08:21.173 --> 08:23.109
Where do you see yourself?
Humor me.

08:23.543 --> 08:25.409
I see myself running
for Congress.

08:25.411 --> 08:26.479
And I see myself winning.

08:27.279 --> 08:28.245
I'm officially humored.

08:28.247 --> 08:30.180
You think I'm kidding.

08:30.182 --> 08:32.418
Congress... I-- Are you even
a resident of any state?

08:32.619 --> 08:34.583
Where's the Podunk town
you come from?

08:34.586 --> 08:36.352
It's not about where I'm from,
it's where I'm going.

08:36.355 --> 08:38.259
[laughing]

08:38.490 --> 08:40.193
That should be your
campaign slogan.

08:40.994 --> 08:42.663
Rob Reynolds will never
take you seriously.

08:43.495 --> 08:44.597
What if I told you...

08:45.731 --> 08:47.900
that Rob Reynolds is going
to have to take me seriously.

08:51.971 --> 08:52.906
If it were me...

08:56.176 --> 08:58.245
I'd go to Reynolds like
I'm doing him a favor.

08:59.379 --> 09:02.079
Give him what I have,
protect my sources...

09:02.081 --> 09:03.516
Does Callie have
anything to do with this?

09:05.217 --> 09:07.084
All right, two things,

09:07.086 --> 09:09.389
and I want you to listen
to me, very carefully.

09:10.990 --> 09:12.991
Do not let Reynolds know

09:12.993 --> 09:14.691
that you want to
run for Congress,

09:14.693 --> 09:16.362
or anything else,
for that matter.

09:17.397 --> 09:18.999
- And?
- And...

09:19.599 --> 09:21.001
just be careful.

09:22.335 --> 09:24.204
These aren't Boy Scouts
you're dealing with.

<i>The Maple Foundation fundraiser.</i>

<i>An annual event to raise money
for Mary's various causes.</i>

09:40.552 --> 09:44.055
<i>In this case, the cause
was the United Party.</i>

09:44.057 --> 09:45.158
Excuse me, sir.

10:09.615 --> 10:11.284
[Michael] <i>Rob Reynolds.</i>

10:18.124 --> 10:19.692
<i>His tactics: questioned.</i>

10:20.259 --> 10:22.096
<i>His resolve: feared.</i>

10:28.467 --> 10:30.501
<i>Rob Reynolds had
started a new party</i>

10:30.503 --> 10:33.206
<i>and Senator Baines
was gonna be the face of it.</i>

10:35.841 --> 10:39.109
This is not about this year,
it's not about this election,

10:39.111 --> 10:41.278
- it's about the next elec...
- Rob, darlin'.

10:41.280 --> 10:42.548
Excuse me, gentlemen.

10:42.816 --> 10:45.386
I wonder if you've
met Michael Lawson.

10:45.751 --> 10:48.085
Michael is... Well, Michael...

10:48.087 --> 10:50.223
Uh, Michael would do
anything to get onboard.

10:50.690 --> 10:53.523
Oh, yeah, well,
good luck, Michael.

10:53.525 --> 10:55.228
Uh, Mary.

10:57.697 --> 11:01.668
[sighs] Don't worry,
darlin', I'll work on him.

11:05.138 --> 11:07.206
[Michael] <i>Well, Kevin had
been right about one thing,</i>

11:07.474 --> 11:09.343
<i>Reynolds was never going
to take me seriously.</i>

11:09.775 --> 11:11.110
<i>I had known that.</i>

11:12.345 --> 11:14.148
<i>But Mary had kept her promise
and gotten me the introduction.</i>

11:14.614 --> 11:15.749
<i>The rest was up to me.</i>

Lydia Bowman. New Year's
Eve a couple years ago.

11:19.751 --> 11:22.453
Senator Barr's party, you were
Rob Reynolds's assistant.

11:22.455 --> 11:24.821
Executive assistant.
Of course, of course.

11:24.823 --> 11:26.159
Michael.

11:26.493 --> 11:28.328
Lawson, yeah, I know.

11:28.861 --> 11:32.231
Lydia, I was wondering
if maybe you...

11:32.565 --> 11:35.465
- Oh, Michael, I'm here with someone.
- I know.

11:35.467 --> 11:38.504
I was wondering if maybe you'd
give this to Mr. Reynolds for me.

11:40.373 --> 11:42.408
Oh, I...
I thought...

11:43.143 --> 11:45.278
- Now I'm embarrassed.
- No, don't be.

11:46.312 --> 11:47.648
I knew you were
here with someone.

11:48.380 --> 11:50.083
My great misfortune.

11:54.586 --> 11:56.521
I'll give this to Rob.
Thank you.

12:01.461 --> 12:03.831
I would like to welcome you
to this party.

12:04.663 --> 12:09.436
And when I say this party, I am not
just talking about this event,

12:09.869 --> 12:12.435
I am talking about a movement.

12:12.437 --> 12:14.441
[all] Yes!
[cheering]

12:16.475 --> 12:21.679
Unlike that broken
Grand Old Party...

12:21.681 --> 12:23.647
[audience laughing]

12:23.649 --> 12:25.849
...this party is United.

12:25.851 --> 12:28.419
[man] Yeah!
[cheering]

12:28.421 --> 12:30.456
Without further ado,

12:30.756 --> 12:34.327
I'm going to give you the man who's
here to get this party started.

12:34.693 --> 12:40.263
From the great state of Texas,
Senator John Boland Baines!

12:40.265 --> 12:42.135
[cheering]

12:55.280 --> 12:56.750
Thank you! Thank you!

12:58.283 --> 13:00.287
Let's get right to it,
shall we?

13:01.486 --> 13:02.355
What has happened to us?

13:03.590 --> 13:06.426
When did we become so angry?
So divided?

13:06.725 --> 13:09.395
[Baines] <i>Why has the voice
of compromise become silent?</i>

13:11.831 --> 13:13.667
Don't let anyone in
until the speech ends.

13:16.769 --> 13:19.302
What does this mean?
I wanted your attention.

13:19.304 --> 13:20.274
You have it.

13:21.274 --> 13:23.907
Yes, okay, I'm, uh...
I'm...

13:23.909 --> 13:26.579

<i>...run by extortionists.</i>

13:33.485 --> 13:35.621
<i>We can unite behind being...</i>
[audio muffles]

13:37.356 --> 13:38.759
I'm in possession of
a thumb drive.

13:39.958 --> 13:42.895
On this drive is a video
of a certain prominent judge.

13:43.395 --> 13:45.463
Very close friend
of the Senator's

13:45.465 --> 13:46.833
and likely to end up on your short
list for the Supreme Court.

13:48.400 --> 13:50.403
In the video,
this judge is...

13:51.638 --> 13:52.670
How do I put this?

13:52.672 --> 13:54.740
In plain English, please.

13:57.476 --> 13:58.978
He's blowing a guy
in a bathroom stall.

14:02.715 --> 14:06.483
[Baines] <i>We can do it,
we can be united!</i>

14:06.485 --> 14:07.788
[audience cheering]

14:08.921 --> 14:11.821
We have people who want
to overthrow the government.

14:11.823 --> 14:14.995
People who want to secede from the Union
because things haven't gone their way.

14:15.595 --> 14:17.795
- Well, that's just not American.
- [audience members] No.

14:17.797 --> 14:20.567
United we stand and divided...

14:23.403 --> 14:24.868
we have failed.

14:24.870 --> 14:26.840
Do you know how Bobby
Kennedy was assassinated?

14:30.909 --> 14:33.279
It was in a kitchen.
A lot like this one.

14:35.447 --> 14:37.850
A little nothing
changed history.

14:38.350 --> 14:39.620
A lot can be
learned from that.

14:40.052 --> 14:41.922
The United Party.

14:43.556 --> 14:44.958
Sounds nice, doesn't it?

14:48.927 --> 14:49.895
What do you want?

14:51.364 --> 14:52.365
I want a job.

14:52.999 --> 14:53.933
Sir.

14:57.736 --> 14:59.972
- Look, I'm not asking you to...
- Shh, shh, shh.

15:00.505 --> 15:02.942
[Baines] <i>We're not determined
to tear down the machinery.</i>

15:04.374 --> 15:05.910
We believe that the
interests of the individual

15:05.912 --> 15:08.749
should be left to the people
involved, not the government!

15:10.982 --> 15:13.286
What if I told you
I won't give you a job?

15:13.653 --> 15:14.855
Hmm? What do you do then?

15:16.688 --> 15:18.024
I hand the drive over to you.

15:19.392 --> 15:20.458
As a friend.

15:20.460 --> 15:21.528
A friend of mine?

15:24.062 --> 15:25.396
A friend of the party.

15:25.398 --> 15:27.964
[audience cheering]

15:27.966 --> 15:30.600
[Baines] <i>We believe
in a free market,</i>

15:30.602 --> 15:33.671
<i>but be prepared to act
when it fails,</i>

15:33.673 --> 15:35.473
<i>or when it is abused.</i>

15:35.475 --> 15:38.575
I believe that we can be
against needless regulations

15:38.577 --> 15:43.049
and yet not deny that our planet
is warming and we must act.

15:43.816 --> 15:46.150
I believe that we can
be pro-business

15:46.152 --> 15:48.651
<i>and still not be held captive
by the vested interests</i>

15:48.653 --> 15:50.590
<i>of billionaires
and corporations.</i>

15:51.791 --> 15:54.328
Welcome to the show,
Michael.

15:55.727 --> 15:57.863
We can be united!

16:02.467 --> 16:03.769
United Party!

16:05.071 --> 16:06.840
[crowd] Baines! Baines! Baines!

16:07.807 --> 16:09.810
Thank you.
Excuse me... Rob.

16:12.511 --> 16:13.844
What'd you think
of the speech?

16:13.846 --> 16:15.912
Very moving, sir,
very presidential.

16:15.914 --> 16:17.915
Let's hope it goes as well
when we make it official, huh?

16:17.917 --> 16:19.386
Of course you will.

16:19.684 --> 16:22.355
I have good news,
Darcy's comin' home.

16:23.623 --> 16:26.022
We'll have to throw a grand ol'
welcome home party for her, won't we?

16:26.024 --> 16:27.757
Yes, we will.
Yes, we will.

16:27.759 --> 16:28.995
Who is this?

16:29.629 --> 16:33.700
Oh, uh, Senator,
this is Michael Lawson.

16:34.133 --> 16:35.435
He's gonna be working for us.

16:35.868 --> 16:37.104
Fantastic!

16:37.570 --> 16:39.703
Well, welcome aboard, Michael.
Thank you, sir.

16:39.705 --> 16:40.970
You're a good-looking kid,
you know that?

16:40.972 --> 16:42.475
[chuckles]
Thank you, sir.

16:42.841 --> 16:43.909
Isn't he?

16:44.443 --> 16:45.444
Isn't he, Judith?

16:46.645 --> 16:47.747
Uh, isn't who what?

16:48.047 --> 16:49.747
Darling,
I was just saying,

16:49.749 --> 16:51.015
Michael Lawson here
is coming to work for us.

16:51.017 --> 16:53.086
I said he was
a good-looking young man.

16:54.120 --> 16:56.022
- Don't you think?
- Yes.

16:57.123 --> 16:59.526
And that is so important
in a campaign.

17:03.863 --> 17:05.094
I'm glad you're with us,

17:05.096 --> 17:06.700
this campaign needs youth.

17:06.999 --> 17:08.067
Thank you, sir.

17:09.867 --> 17:11.771
Excuse me. Vonetta!

17:15.007 --> 17:16.643
Senator Baines.

17:19.010 --> 17:20.913
You were smart
with me today.

17:21.980 --> 17:23.048
Keep it up.

17:25.483 --> 17:26.852
I want that flash drive.

17:34.192 --> 17:36.863
[Michael] <i>At times,
life can be grand.</i>

17:52.010 --> 17:53.145

[Michael] <i>I had convinced myself
that what I was about to do</i>

18:10.663 --> 18:12.466
<i>was the best thing
for both of us.</i>

18:14.799 --> 18:17.604
[hip-hop music playing, on
headphones] [man rapping]

18:23.075 --> 18:25.676
Well, if it looks like a duck
and it quacks like a duck,

18:25.678 --> 18:29.015
it's probably a judge blowing a guy
in the bathroom stall. [chuckles]

18:29.248 --> 18:31.183
- It's the only copy, I wiped it...
- What?

18:31.584 --> 18:32.885
It's the only copy.

18:33.184 --> 18:35.286
I wiped the computer
and the original sources...

18:35.288 --> 18:37.921
How do I know it's not out there
floating in the cloud somewhere

18:37.923 --> 18:39.556
just waiting
to be downloaded?

18:39.558 --> 18:41.292
You don't.
You just gotta trust me.

18:41.294 --> 18:42.629
But I don't trust anyone.

18:56.741 --> 18:58.845
- I don't follow.
- There's nothing to follow.

19:00.246 --> 19:02.278
The senator's daughter
coming into town,

19:02.280 --> 19:04.748
I'm gonna need you to go on
over there and help out Judith.

19:04.750 --> 19:07.951
Yeah, sure, absolutely.
Uh, anything to help out.

19:07.953 --> 19:10.856
Hey, is Callie Roland
looking for a job?

19:11.289 --> 19:13.026
Find out.

19:13.291 --> 19:15.292
We'll pay her, she'll continue
to do what she does best,

19:15.294 --> 19:16.863
destroy bad people.

19:17.096 --> 19:18.230
Everybody wins.

19:19.432 --> 19:21.535
- [phone rings -And I paid
your next six months' rent.

19:22.335 --> 19:24.634
- Oh, I didn't ask you to...
- Forget it. It's done.

19:24.636 --> 19:26.005
Go talk to Lydia,
I need to grab this.

19:26.739 --> 19:28.905
Hey, hey! Mad Cash!

19:28.907 --> 19:30.943
I was just listening
to your latest hit.

19:31.242 --> 19:32.809
Oh, man, it's a smash.

19:32.811 --> 19:35.247
[hip-hop song playing]
[man rapping]

19:40.786 --> 19:44.622
[Michael] <i>Wallace Pellum, aka Mad
Cash, was a high school dropout</i>

19:44.624 --> 19:48.225
<i>who parlayed early hip-hop success
with mass crossover appeal.</i>

19:48.227 --> 19:50.960
<i>By the age of 30,</i>

19:50.962 --> 19:52.830
<i>the dapper entrepreneur was rumored to
be worth close to a billion dollars.</i>

19:52.832 --> 19:54.765
So why should I want to get the
vote out for your candidate?

19:54.767 --> 19:56.933
[Michael] <i>Rob Reynolds
had plans for this new party.</i>

19:56.935 --> 19:59.670
<i>And in his mind, Mad Cash
would play a big part in it.</i>

19:59.672 --> 20:00.837
You going to church
tomorrow?

20:00.839 --> 20:01.707
Yes, I am.

20:02.240 --> 20:04.144
You know I believe in God.
Well, so am I.

20:04.676 --> 20:06.812
Tomorrow could be
the revolution, Wallace.

20:07.078 --> 20:11.347
I mean, we have the real party,
this time we get it right.

20:11.349 --> 20:13.185
And the Latino vote too.

20:13.786 --> 20:15.285
Good, my babies
are half Latino.

20:15.287 --> 20:16.855
Exactly! You see?

20:17.189 --> 20:18.721
We're aligned.

20:18.723 --> 20:21.392
Me, you, Baines,
and the United Part

20:21.394 --> 20:23.195
are gonna take back
the right.

20:24.029 --> 20:25.065
Yeah, well...

20:26.965 --> 20:28.200
we may have your values,

20:29.201 --> 20:30.804
but we still just
niggers to you.

20:33.172 --> 20:35.909
Well, you have to find
your place in the party.

20:36.275 --> 20:38.678
And you might as well be
sitting with the big boys.

20:41.413 --> 20:42.648
True that, my brother.

20:43.148 --> 20:44.116
True that.

20:48.220 --> 20:50.019
[Michael]
<i>Tanya and Callie were...</i>

20:50.021 --> 20:51.822
<i>Oh, let's just say
they were tight.</i>

20:51.824 --> 20:53.190
Really? No one's gonna
sit up front with me?

20:53.192 --> 20:54.294
Let's just hit the road, Jack.

20:54.693 --> 20:56.959
Ooh! You looking
real good, Mike.

20:56.961 --> 20:58.163
Thank you, Tanya.

20:58.897 --> 21:00.698
[Tanya] You want a bump? A bump?

21:00.700 --> 21:02.966
- Yes!
- No, no, I'm all right.

21:02.968 --> 21:05.268
[Michael] <i>Tanya had come
to DC from Pennsylvania.</i>

21:05.270 --> 21:07.807
[sniffs] <i>She wanted to be a
serious television journalist.</i>

21:08.039 --> 21:09.209
<i>So far, it hadn't worked out.</i>

21:09.474 --> 21:11.110
Hey, Tanya...
[Callie] No!

21:11.443 --> 21:13.744
- You can't borrow the SUV again...
- Yes.

21:13.746 --> 21:16.447
You can borrow my SUV for
as long as you want, baby!

21:16.449 --> 21:18.114
Thank you, Tanya.
[Callie] Why are you so nice?

21:18.116 --> 21:19.749
'Cause I love him.

21:19.751 --> 21:20.886
No, you don't.
I do.

21:21.988 --> 21:25.225
[Michael] <i>Like I said,
they were... tight.</i>

21:33.798 --> 21:37.369
[Judith] I like the cut glass, but I
don't care for anything iridescent.

21:37.936 --> 21:39.104
Okay, then. Yeah.

21:40.338 --> 21:42.274
And then, um, cut glass.

21:42.842 --> 21:44.341
And I like the silver,
I don't want...

21:44.343 --> 21:46.211
[clears throat]
Uh, Mrs. Baines.

21:47.378 --> 21:48.347
Hi.

21:49.481 --> 21:50.817
An SUV?

21:52.417 --> 21:54.186
I'll be inside.

21:55.721 --> 21:57.057
[Michael] <i>Mrs. Baines was an
environmentally conscious conservative.</i>

21:58.758 --> 22:00.125
You really have to
get rid of that.

22:00.492 --> 22:01.394
Sit down.

22:02.595 --> 22:06.028
Young man traveling around as
a single passenger in an SUV,

22:06.030 --> 22:07.864
do you have any idea
the carbon footprint...

22:07.866 --> 22:09.469
- You won't see it again.
- Good.

22:10.001 --> 22:11.468
One of the things
that bothers me the most

22:11.470 --> 22:13.906
about my husband
and this campaign is that

22:14.306 --> 22:16.109
he'll no longer travel
on a commercial airline.

22:16.307 --> 22:18.542
I mean, he's going to be traveling
around on a private jet.

22:18.544 --> 22:20.878
Yeah, those small planes,
they make me nervous too.

22:20.880 --> 22:23.247
No, it's about
the fuel consumption.

22:23.249 --> 22:25.181
Those things are the worst.

22:25.183 --> 22:27.250
Listen, you have to understand,
this campaign is going to be

22:27.252 --> 22:29.318
a cross between
the Reagan philosophy

22:29.320 --> 22:32.088
and when Jimmy Carter had solar panels
installed on the White House roof.

22:32.090 --> 22:33.524
They worked wonderfully.

22:33.526 --> 22:35.926
You're probably too young
to remember any of this.

22:35.928 --> 22:38.796
Unfortunately, they were dismantled
during the Reagan administration.

22:38.798 --> 22:42.134
It's the only blemish on an
otherwise perfect presidency.

22:44.269 --> 22:45.238
So...

22:46.271 --> 22:48.307
Mary Maple tells me
you have a beautiful cock.

22:49.541 --> 22:50.809
Oh...

22:51.911 --> 22:53.046
Sorry, what?

22:54.180 --> 22:55.448
[sighs] Come with me.

22:57.082 --> 22:59.850
Oh! You should think
about getting a Volt.

22:59.852 --> 23:01.250
Not only are they
American-made,

23:01.252 --> 23:03.388
but they run on
gas and electric.

23:32.250 --> 23:33.787
[softly]
Look at this.

23:50.336 --> 23:51.471
I can't do this.

23:52.538 --> 23:53.472
Really?

23:54.506 --> 23:56.509
I see evidence
to the contrary.

23:58.210 --> 23:59.112
This is wrong.

23:59.345 --> 24:00.947
I don't feel
right about this.

24:01.614 --> 24:03.516
[sighs] You know
how you got here.

24:06.184 --> 24:07.586
I know how
you got here.

24:24.435 --> 24:25.571
Get up.

24:31.676 --> 24:33.512
What...
what are you doing?

24:34.212 --> 24:36.883
[moaning]

24:54.566 --> 24:56.201
[moans]

24:59.438 --> 25:00.607
[moaning]

25:36.642 --> 25:37.576
Now you can.

25:47.385 --> 25:48.651
Excuse me?

25:48.653 --> 25:49.923
I'm working for
Senator Baines.

25:51.123 --> 25:53.625
[laughing]

25:54.125 --> 25:55.459
Yeah, right.

25:55.461 --> 25:56.461
Yeah, no, I'm serious.

25:57.096 --> 25:58.364
[chuckles] Come on.

25:58.730 --> 26:00.430
- It just happened, Callie...
- No.

26:00.432 --> 26:02.969
No, things like this
don't just happen.

26:03.268 --> 26:05.401
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

26:05.403 --> 26:08.438
Why would they even hire you knowing
your history, our politics?

26:08.440 --> 26:10.007
It just doesn't...
Yeah, well,

26:10.009 --> 26:12.174
that, uh, brings me
to my other thing.

26:12.176 --> 26:13.545
- There's a second thing?
- Yeah.

26:14.779 --> 26:16.214
I gave them
the thumb drive.

26:17.648 --> 26:18.748
What thumb drive?

26:18.750 --> 26:20.153
The Judge Karl video.

26:20.451 --> 26:21.954
I gave it
to Rob Reynolds.

26:22.387 --> 26:23.588
He's the one that
offered me the job.

26:28.027 --> 26:29.328
Are you fucking
kidding me?

26:30.695 --> 26:32.395
That was mine.

26:32.397 --> 26:34.398
- Well, okay, it was sort of yours.
- No!

26:34.400 --> 26:36.033
These are mine!

26:36.035 --> 26:37.437
Okay, Callie, well,
I had to do something.

26:37.736 --> 26:40.303
I had to make a move because we
were drowning, you know that.

26:40.305 --> 26:41.571
I mean, come on, look.

26:41.573 --> 26:43.039
I give the drive
to Rob Reynolds,

26:43.041 --> 26:44.074
he pays our rent
for the next six months.

26:44.076 --> 26:44.743
Look at this.

26:45.944 --> 26:47.646
That's more money than you've
seen in your whole life.

26:48.847 --> 26:50.180
Plus the reality is, now
that they've seen the video,

26:50.182 --> 26:52.748
no way Judge Karl's getting
nominated for the Supreme Court,

26:52.750 --> 26:54.217
so frankly,
it's a win-win.

26:54.219 --> 26:55.151
Win-win?

26:55.153 --> 26:57.421
Michael, this is insane.

26:57.423 --> 27:00.356
Goddamn it, are you for real?
The United Party?

27:00.358 --> 27:03.192
Okay, yes. But Baines
is actually different.

27:03.194 --> 27:05.062
- He's a fascist.
- Fa... [scoffs]

27:05.064 --> 27:06.395
Come on, Cal!
What does that even mean?

27:06.397 --> 27:08.364
You know what it means!

27:08.366 --> 27:09.665
They'll sell guns to
seven-year-olds, while they laugh

27:09.667 --> 27:11.535
as cops fucking kill
people in the street!

27:11.537 --> 27:14.403
The want to de-unionize,
deregulate the entire universe.

27:14.405 --> 27:16.506
They'll sell us food that
they refuse to eat... Callie.

27:16.508 --> 27:19.209
They still are trying to overturn <i>Roe v.
Wade,</i> for God's sakes!

27:19.211 --> 27:21.344
Callie! What? They're the
personification of evil.

27:21.346 --> 27:24.213
And your good buddy Rob
Reynolds is the devil himself.

27:24.215 --> 27:26.218
Michael, what the fuck
were you thinking?

27:26.718 --> 27:28.054
They wanna hire you too.

27:41.400 --> 27:42.535
So, what did he
say about me?

27:45.537 --> 27:48.708
- [rock song playing]
- [man singing]

27:50.375 --> 27:53.445
[Michael] <i>The Volt. It runs on
gas and it runs on battery.</i>

27:55.314 --> 27:57.150
<i>This car was who I needed to be.</i>

27:57.348 --> 27:59.149
<i>You know, make
my own environment safe,</i>

27:59.151 --> 28:00.787
<i>create as little
pollution as possible.</i>

28:26.644 --> 28:29.548
[Michael] <i>I was laying the groundwork
for my own political career.</i>

28:31.150 --> 28:33.449
<i>Now, I know what
you're thinking,</i>

28:33.451 --> 28:35.454
<i>but four years from now I could
be Congressman Michael Lawson.</i>

28:35.686 --> 28:37.622
<i>Then I could really help
the people who needed it.</i>

28:39.191 --> 28:40.526
<i>It was worth the risk.</i>

28:41.359 --> 28:42.761
<i>At least, that's what
I told myself.</i>

29:02.314 --> 29:04.450
You call that dressing
inconspicuously?

29:05.517 --> 29:07.220
- What?
- Drive.

29:13.291 --> 29:14.259
If you want a job...

29:14.759 --> 29:16.660
[sighs] What do
you need done?

29:16.662 --> 29:18.764
- Martin Goodrich.
- Hmm.

29:19.597 --> 29:21.631
[imitating Southern accent] Senator
from the great state of Florida?

29:21.633 --> 29:23.536
Yep, that's right.

29:25.170 --> 29:26.536
[normal accent] You know, they actually
like their Social Security down there,

29:26.538 --> 29:29.775
so, I bet he's gonna mop the floor
with your guy on primary day, huh?

29:32.778 --> 29:34.844
- Goodrich is a pervert.
- I bet.

29:34.846 --> 29:37.415
We hear he's into some
pretty unsavory shit.

29:39.250 --> 29:40.219
I heard the same, yeah.

29:40.519 --> 29:41.820
Can you get it on camera?

29:44.489 --> 29:46.826
Well... that depends.

29:50.596 --> 29:53.332
That's half. Make sure
to pack your sunscreen.

29:57.568 --> 30:01.270
Fucking hate your politics, but...
the money's not bad.

30:01.272 --> 30:02.174
[Rob] Pull over.

30:18.757 --> 30:23.962
[band playing
"Hail to the Chief"]

30:29.835 --> 30:31.671
[continues]

30:32.471 --> 30:35.305
Please, please, not that song.
Not today.

30:35.307 --> 30:36.706
[song ends]

30:36.708 --> 30:38.344
Today is about
something different.

30:38.876 --> 30:42.280
Today is about friends,
old and new,

30:42.513 --> 30:44.716
helping us to welcome home
somebody very special.

30:45.284 --> 30:47.286
It's about the best
daughter a man could want.

30:47.986 --> 30:50.323
My daughter,
our daughter,

30:52.490 --> 30:54.423
Darcy Baines.
Come on down, baby.

30:54.425 --> 30:56.561
[applause]
[band playing]

31:02.534 --> 31:04.303
[applause quiets]

31:06.771 --> 31:07.772
[Baines] Have fun.

31:11.410 --> 31:12.945
Hi! You look amazing.

31:16.048 --> 31:17.849

31:29.027 --> 31:30.630
[lighter clinks,
clicks]

31:31.329 --> 31:32.264
[Darcy] Don't do that.

31:36.968 --> 31:38.903
I had actually given
it up the other day.

31:42.941 --> 31:44.009
Smoking?

31:45.743 --> 31:46.878
Maybe.

31:48.980 --> 31:50.449
I'm Darcy.

31:53.484 --> 31:55.487
[clears throat] Michael Lawson.
I work for your father.

31:55.987 --> 31:56.956
So...

31:57.622 --> 31:58.990
what do you do for my father?

32:00.558 --> 32:02.360
Not sure,
I just started.

32:03.362 --> 32:04.764
I...

32:05.063 --> 32:07.566
I think he'd make a great
president, so I help out.

32:11.369 --> 32:12.070
Well...

32:13.971 --> 32:15.340
you're very...

32:17.041 --> 32:18.343
[exhales]

32:19.845 --> 32:20.880
Very what?

32:23.582 --> 32:24.517
I don't know.

32:25.150 --> 32:26.786
[both chuckle]

32:31.556 --> 32:32.825
[lighter clinks,
clicks]

32:38.028 --> 32:39.397
Better not let
your mother see that.

32:39.631 --> 32:40.700
Yeah, my mother's dead.

32:42.701 --> 32:43.903
Sorry, I...
I meant Judith.

32:44.568 --> 32:46.938
[chuckles] Yeah,
I know what you meant.

32:48.507 --> 32:50.810
Anyway, everything always
gets cleaned up around here,

32:51.675 --> 32:52.677
don't you know?

32:53.811 --> 32:54.746
Hmm.

32:57.516 --> 32:59.485
Hey, I have an idea.

33:04.823 --> 33:07.826
[band playing traditional pop]

33:30.882 --> 33:33.085
Jesus, she looks just like her.
Who?

33:40.991 --> 33:43.826
Judith, I need to know that you two
are gonna get along this time.

33:43.828 --> 33:44.797
Promise me?

33:45.830 --> 33:47.565
Well, of course
I promise.

33:49.067 --> 33:50.566
Well, I'll
leave you to it.

33:50.568 --> 33:52.835
That dinner with
Senator Woodward...

33:52.837 --> 33:54.839
- Yeah?
- Forget it. You don't need him.

33:55.640 --> 33:57.039
He's a friend, Rob.

33:57.041 --> 33:59.477
I know, we'll reschedule,
but something came up.

33:59.778 --> 34:02.714
What? Senator, you're
flying home to Dallas.

34:04.082 --> 34:06.451
Gertie Hayden? Just got
off the phone with her.

34:06.750 --> 34:09.621
- Our cash cow has finally come in.
- It seems so.

34:10.088 --> 34:12.489
Well, let's hope she's ready
to give forth generously.

34:13.925 --> 34:15.027
Are you coming?

34:16.027 --> 34:17.559
Don't think so, don't
want to spoil the milk.

34:17.561 --> 34:19.228
You'll need
someone with.

34:19.231 --> 34:20.900
I'll call Billy, make sure
he gets the somebody.

34:22.233 --> 34:23.201
Sounds good.

34:32.610 --> 34:33.777
So, how'd you
like Europe?

34:35.847 --> 34:36.916
Liked leaving it.

34:37.215 --> 34:38.818
- Really?
- Yeah.

34:40.251 --> 34:41.619
[scoffs]

34:44.054 --> 34:46.826
[Michael sighs]
Okay.

34:49.027 --> 34:50.829
So, uh...

34:53.898 --> 34:54.799
So?

34:56.967 --> 34:58.903
- So, I give up.
- Smoking?

34:59.103 --> 35:00.038
What?

35:03.974 --> 35:05.610
You're gonna give up
smoking for me.

35:08.012 --> 35:08.980
I am.

35:10.949 --> 35:11.884
Yeah.

35:17.922 --> 35:19.791
You're gonna give up
everything for me.

35:22.661 --> 35:23.695
Uh...

35:25.563 --> 35:26.565
Really.

35:30.101 --> 35:31.070
Course.

35:33.137 --> 35:34.038
Why?

35:35.106 --> 35:36.208
Because.

35:37.141 --> 35:38.109
Darcy.

35:39.911 --> 35:40.945
[whispers] Say it again.

35:42.213 --> 35:44.048
- Say what again?
- My name.

35:45.016 --> 35:46.085
Say it again.

35:48.686 --> 35:51.022
I just started
this job, Darcy.

35:52.690 --> 35:53.791
Say it again.

35:54.759 --> 35:55.760
[Rob] Darcy!

35:58.663 --> 35:59.831
Your father's
looking for you.

36:15.847 --> 36:17.783
She's a little young
for you, Michael.

36:25.724 --> 36:27.593
[Kevin] <i>Poor little
Rob Reynolds.</i>

36:28.226 --> 36:30.695
<i>Dog bites his face
when he's seven years old.</i>

36:31.295 --> 36:33.197
<i>I can see him writing
in his composition book,</i>

36:33.697 --> 36:34.998
"What shall I become?

36:35.000 --> 36:36.902
President of
the United States."

36:37.902 --> 36:39.070
Probably broke
his little heart.

36:40.170 --> 36:41.970
I bet the happiest
day of his life

36:41.972 --> 36:43.708
was when he realized
he could grow a beard.

36:44.409 --> 36:47.613
I mean, think about what that does to you.
I mean, he's...

36:48.146 --> 36:49.682
He's a powerful guy.

36:51.050 --> 36:53.318
Hell, he might end up being one of
the most powerful men in America.

36:54.284 --> 36:57.755
But he'll never
be president.

37:01.893 --> 37:03.295
Almost makes you feel
sorry for the guy.

37:04.161 --> 37:06.864
Don't. He probably
bit the dog first.

37:07.731 --> 37:08.666
[chuckles] Hah, hah.

37:10.367 --> 37:13.802
[Kevin] Look who's come down from Mount
Olympus to mingle with the unwashed masses.

37:13.804 --> 37:17.208
[Michael] <i>Jerry Todd, the
right hand of the left wing.</i>

37:17.809 --> 37:19.979
<i>He had already gotten
the last two presidents elected.</i>

37:24.949 --> 37:25.884
What?

37:27.786 --> 37:29.855
Usually, at this point, I
ask you who you're fucking.

37:30.188 --> 37:32.691
No. No, no, no, that's usually
the first thing you ask me.

37:37.394 --> 37:39.831
Tell me you're not
fucking Judith Baines.

37:42.967 --> 37:43.969
[scoffs]

37:45.769 --> 37:47.239
I'm not fucking
Judith Baines.

37:49.039 --> 37:50.175
Jesus, man.

37:51.342 --> 37:54.776
Good, because then you'd
be as reckless as Callie,

37:54.778 --> 37:56.215
and I know you're
not that stupid, right?

37:57.849 --> 37:59.051
I'm not crazy.

38:00.050 --> 38:01.420
[cell phone ringing]

38:05.289 --> 38:06.291
Yeah?

38:07.458 --> 38:08.393
Yeah.

38:09.327 --> 38:10.295
Absolutely.

38:11.195 --> 38:13.699
Yeah, absolutely,
I'll... I'll be there.

38:15.766 --> 38:16.534
Okay.

38:17.969 --> 38:19.672
I'm flying with
Baines to Dallas.

38:21.940 --> 38:22.941
Dallas?

38:24.409 --> 38:25.943
Nothing bad ever
happened there.

38:27.112 --> 38:28.213
I have to take a piss.

38:39.824 --> 38:41.389
[Michael] <i>I had heard
Jerry Todd was looking</i>

38:41.391 --> 38:43.361
<i>for someone inside
the Baines campaign.</i>

38:43.862 --> 38:45.898
- [man] How's it hangin'?
- <i>You had to hand it to him,</i>

38:46.197 --> 38:48.865
<i>he had a way of catching you
at your most vulnerable.</i>

38:48.867 --> 38:50.402
Look, you hang
to the left.

38:51.802 --> 38:53.771
You worked for Lester
Garret, didn't you?

38:55.773 --> 39:00.011
So, what do you think you could
do for me if I were to hire you?

39:03.081 --> 39:04.216
Well, Jerry...

39:06.918 --> 39:09.488
I've actually been leaning a
little more to the right recently.

39:10.521 --> 39:12.190
But it's been nice
hanging with you.

39:12.791 --> 39:14.927
Well, let me know if you
ever change your mind.

39:26.838 --> 39:27.940
Good morning.

39:32.342 --> 39:34.413
Did you enjoy yourself
at your party?

39:35.246 --> 39:36.148
Yeah.

39:37.047 --> 39:38.049
Good.

39:39.117 --> 39:42.387
I noticed that you were
dancing with Michael Lawson.

39:44.088 --> 39:45.923
Darcy, now that
your father's...

39:46.925 --> 39:48.393
Well, we need
to be careful.

39:49.327 --> 39:50.329
"Careful."

39:51.461 --> 39:52.630
"We."

39:57.135 --> 39:58.237
You know what I mean.

40:00.405 --> 40:02.007
Is this coming
from my father?

40:03.340 --> 40:05.210
Mmm...

40:05.409 --> 40:07.378
Anything regarding the campaign
is coming from the both of us.

40:10.581 --> 40:12.150
We were just dancing.

40:16.954 --> 40:18.456
All right.
[clears throat]

40:19.489 --> 40:21.425
Um...
Enjoy your breakfast.

40:29.934 --> 40:32.568
[interviewer] <i>Senator, you've been
recently criticized by the NAACP</i>

40:32.570 --> 40:34.970
<i>for your advocacy

40:34.972 --> 40:38.177
<i>yet you claim that you yourself
have never been racially profiled.</i>

[Vonetta] <i>No, not
that I remember.</i>

40:40.644 --> 40:44.382

- <i>Yes. I heard what he had to say.</i>

- [TV clicks off]

41:04.568 --> 41:05.871
John,

41:06.938 --> 41:09.237
you cannot have Vonetta
Calhoun stand next to you

41:09.239 --> 41:10.673
when you announce
your candidacy.

41:10.675 --> 41:13.144
- I can't?
- She will hurt you

41:13.478 --> 41:16.012
more than she will help you
with the black vote.

41:16.014 --> 41:17.182
African-American.

41:17.414 --> 41:19.217
African-American, yes.

41:20.083 --> 41:23.020
I see her down the line
as a possible running mate.

41:24.389 --> 41:26.124
That would be crazy, John.

41:27.391 --> 41:28.426
Senator.

41:30.094 --> 41:31.463
What's your
real problem, Rob?

41:32.030 --> 41:33.999
That she criticized
your rap star buddy?

41:36.266 --> 41:38.169
Senator, sir,

41:38.603 --> 41:41.237
my rap star buddy can walk
into any neighborhood...

41:41.239 --> 41:43.606
Caucasian, African-American,
Latino...

41:43.608 --> 41:47.043
and not only register
votes, but get you votes.

41:47.045 --> 41:51.083
He's a cultural icon and a
social media phenomenon.

41:51.416 --> 41:55.153
My rap star buddy...
is a billionaire.

42:00.525 --> 42:03.896
I want Vonetta Calhoun standing
next to me when I announce.

42:08.099 --> 42:09.434
And where do you
want Judith?

42:26.985 --> 42:28.687
So, I understand you
worked with Lester Garret.

42:29.519 --> 42:32.722
Oh, yes, sir, I interned for
him after I graduated from GW.

42:32.724 --> 42:35.027
That turned into a
full-time position, but...

42:36.159 --> 42:37.362
Well, you know what happened.

42:39.063 --> 42:39.864
Ol' Lester.

42:41.398 --> 42:42.733
I'll say this about
Lester Garret...

42:44.168 --> 42:46.972
he went to bed at the end of the
day believing his own bullshit.

42:47.672 --> 42:49.541
And I mean that
in a positive way.

42:50.307 --> 42:52.076
Yes, sir.
Can I freshen you up?

42:52.342 --> 42:54.478
Oh, no thank you, I'm still
working on this one, sir.

42:55.646 --> 42:58.016
Michael, call me John.

42:58.382 --> 42:59.283
Sure.

43:00.550 --> 43:04.556
I had a tendency
to overindulge, so...

43:05.188 --> 43:06.287
It's in the genes.

43:06.289 --> 43:08.190
Is that so?

43:08.192 --> 43:10.628
My father, he did a lot of damage
to his liver, to his family.

43:11.695 --> 43:13.329
Were you close
with your dad?

43:13.331 --> 43:15.300
No, no, he wasn't
around much.

43:16.333 --> 43:17.402
How 'bout your mom?

43:19.804 --> 43:21.740
I had an aunt,
her sister.

43:22.773 --> 43:24.108
She was, uh...

43:26.110 --> 43:27.179
kind to me.

43:32.583 --> 43:34.215
Can't pick your
family, sir.

43:34.217 --> 43:36.519
[chuckles] Least not
the first time around.

43:36.521 --> 43:37.756
[chuckles]

43:38.422 --> 43:40.091
Nothing harder
than family.

43:40.791 --> 43:42.293
Nothing more important either.

43:44.628 --> 43:46.030
Family, yes, sir.

43:46.797 --> 43:50.101
- And, Michael, call me John.
- Right, yes.

43:51.768 --> 43:54.572
- [pop song playing]
- [woman singing]

43:56.773 --> 43:59.010
[woman rapping]

44:08.219 --> 44:09.688
Who's your lady friend
over there?

44:10.822 --> 44:12.289
Tanya is her name.

44:12.789 --> 44:14.692
And I have yet
to see her naked.

44:15.460 --> 44:16.360
You want that?

44:19.230 --> 44:20.231
Yeah, you want that.

44:23.768 --> 44:25.070
Tanya.

44:26.771 --> 44:27.702
Come here.

44:27.704 --> 44:30.074
[song continues]

44:35.847 --> 44:37.082
[inaudible]

44:44.222 --> 44:46.091
I wanna know more about
your friend here.

44:52.463 --> 44:53.498
Rob.

44:54.798 --> 44:55.699
Tanya.

44:57.135 --> 44:57.867
[Tanya]
How are you?

44:57.869 --> 45:00.172
[song ends]

45:01.672 --> 45:05.141
[Darcy] Oh, yeah, I think I saw...
[Baines] You did, huh?

45:05.143 --> 45:07.175
That's what comes with
running a ranch.

45:07.177 --> 45:08.579
- Okay.
- I guess.

45:08.880 --> 45:11.182
- Hey, morning.
- [Baines] Morning.

45:13.184 --> 45:14.786
[Darcy] You like eggs?
Yeah, thank you.

45:15.353 --> 45:16.387
Good.

45:16.586 --> 45:17.621
Then sit.

45:18.356 --> 45:20.225
You remember
my daughter, Darcy?

45:20.557 --> 45:21.425
[Michael] I do.

45:22.626 --> 45:24.596
Did I not tell you
she was going to be here?

45:25.429 --> 45:26.762
You did not.

45:26.764 --> 45:29.668
That's because my father
always wanted a son.

45:30.268 --> 45:31.202
That's not true.

45:31.668 --> 45:32.871
I wanted two sons.
[chuckles]

45:34.539 --> 45:36.408
- Don't burn the eggs.
- [laughs]

45:40.710 --> 45:42.279
It's not gonna pour itself.

45:43.280 --> 45:44.048
Huh?

45:44.681 --> 45:46.682
You look like
you could use some.

45:46.684 --> 45:47.786
Oh. Thank you.

45:52.889 --> 45:56.293
[Baines] So, Vonetta Calhoun.

45:56.893 --> 45:58.961
- Senator from Virginia.
- Yeah.

45:58.963 --> 46:00.362
Did you see that clip?

46:00.364 --> 46:01.599
The racial profiling thing?

46:02.199 --> 46:03.432
Yeah, I did.

46:03.434 --> 46:04.436
What'd you think?

46:05.436 --> 46:07.469
Honestly, I think
the racial profiling issue

46:07.471 --> 46:09.141
is a lot more complicated than
the people are willing to admit.

46:09.340 --> 46:10.606
I know that.

46:10.608 --> 46:11.810
What do you think of her?

46:14.844 --> 46:17.313
The people
she's talking about

46:17.315 --> 46:19.583
are way more interested in assimilation
and survival than anything else.

46:21.619 --> 46:24.689
Like, you can't attract young voters
by attacking the way they dress.

46:32.396 --> 46:34.365
- So precious.
- Hi.

46:38.735 --> 46:40.638
[man] You only get
two tries for free.

46:42.706 --> 46:46.411
[Michael] <i>Gertie Hayden, the
cash cow, was old Texas oil.</i>

46:46.677 --> 46:49.181
<i>She had already bankrolled
one ex-president.</i>

46:54.318 --> 46:56.254
I don't trust a man
who don't drink.

46:59.789 --> 47:00.791
Yeah.

47:02.793 --> 47:03.762
Okay.

47:08.932 --> 47:10.766
You sure are
pretty to look at.

47:10.768 --> 47:12.603
- [chuckles]
- [laughs]

47:13.536 --> 47:16.674
- Now, that Reynolds boy, Ron Reynolds.
- Rob.

47:17.742 --> 47:19.911
Rob, Ron, whatever
the hell his name is.

47:20.978 --> 47:23.447
That boy gives me the heebie-jeebies,
you know what I mean?

47:24.282 --> 47:25.784
I believe in John.

47:26.050 --> 47:28.687
He's a hell of a man and
that's why I'm gonna back him.

47:30.454 --> 47:33.988
Can't stand that wife,
though. [sighs]

47:33.990 --> 47:35.893
Now, she is a terrific kid.

47:37.295 --> 47:40.331
When her mama died,
John didn't know what to do.

47:40.864 --> 47:42.563
That little girl,
as a seven-year-old,

47:42.565 --> 47:44.365
had more to do
with bringing John back

47:44.367 --> 47:46.237
than anything that
bitch has ever done.

47:47.304 --> 47:49.537
First thing Judith did
after they got married

47:49.539 --> 47:52.344
was to send Darcy away to a
private school in New England.

47:53.411 --> 47:55.547
[sighs]
Don't get me wrong,

47:55.846 --> 47:57.983
Judith has helped his
political career, all right.

47:58.516 --> 48:00.719
But with that little girl
away from him,

48:01.452 --> 48:03.588
that just about
broke John's heart.

48:04.422 --> 48:05.557
Is that right?

48:12.429 --> 48:15.963
I am so glad John decided
to unite us on this trip.

48:15.965 --> 48:17.534
[laughs]

48:17.867 --> 48:18.902
[Baines]
Come on.

48:24.708 --> 48:30.646
[Rob] And this is the answer to the
post-neocon Tea Party movements

48:30.648 --> 48:31.947
that have hijacked
the Republican...

48:31.949 --> 48:34.416
[Michael]
<i>Back in the capital,</i>

48:34.418 --> 48:36.552
<i>Tanya had agreed to have dinner with
Rob Reynolds as a favor to Mad Cash.</i>

48:36.554 --> 48:41.590
...family values, fiscal
responsibility, and my baby.

48:41.592 --> 48:44.059
I'm calling all the shots, and
once we get to the White House...

48:44.061 --> 48:46.298
Mad Cash said you know
people in television.

48:49.632 --> 48:50.668
Yeah.

48:51.969 --> 48:53.901
So, do you know anyone
at <i>Access Hollywood?</i>

48:53.903 --> 48:55.739
Because I think
I'd be good at that.

48:57.041 --> 48:58.943
This is the
District of Columbia.

49:00.744 --> 49:01.980
So you can't
help me with that?

49:03.447 --> 49:04.916
I know people
at Fox News.

49:07.083 --> 49:09.453
- Rob!
- Jerry.

49:10.855 --> 49:12.954
Jerry Todd,
Tanya Jones.

49:12.956 --> 49:14.326
Miss Jones.

49:14.557 --> 49:16.061
So, how goes
the campaign, Rob?

49:16.893 --> 49:18.529
- What campaign?
- Ha!

49:18.929 --> 49:21.733
Rob and I have the same job,
only I'm on a real team.

49:22.766 --> 49:25.836
Speaking of teams.
Isn't that Kenyon Carver?

49:26.036 --> 49:29.574
Also known to basketball fans as Mr.
Downtown?

49:30.708 --> 49:31.710
A pleasure.

49:34.545 --> 49:35.747
You don't like
your salad?

50:02.907 --> 50:03.875
Get in.

50:06.510 --> 50:09.013
Umm, excuse me, I'm gonna
go to the ladies room.

50:22.793 --> 50:24.061
Look at Kenyon Carver there.

50:27.164 --> 50:28.967
He's the most selfish
player in the league.

50:31.936 --> 50:34.606
He wouldn't pass the salt to his
own mother at the dinner table.

50:36.907 --> 50:38.910
You know, I was
never good at math, Rob.

50:39.909 --> 50:42.679
But subtraction would indicate
you're minus one date.

51:19.983 --> 51:21.952
Did you sleep with
that old woman?

51:28.626 --> 51:29.594
No.

51:43.873 --> 51:45.108
[Darcy] This is
where it happened.

51:46.809 --> 51:48.012
And I was in the car
with her.

51:50.681 --> 51:52.550
She never saw
the other car coming.

52:01.157 --> 52:04.261
After the accident, when I finally
went back to school, um...

52:05.862 --> 52:08.799
the bus would drive
past here every day.

52:09.199 --> 52:13.070
And, um... then one
day I just, I...

52:13.704 --> 52:15.240
I broke.
I broke down.

52:17.675 --> 52:18.877
I told my father.

52:21.911 --> 52:24.214
You know, he didn't want
me to see that, so...

52:26.951 --> 52:30.121
he used his influence
to have the bus rerouted.

52:33.724 --> 52:35.760
Took 20 minutes longer
to get to school, but...

52:38.929 --> 52:40.865
I never had to go
by here again.

52:51.875 --> 52:53.177
You have to promise...

52:54.811 --> 52:56.246
to never hurt my father.

52:58.715 --> 52:59.650
Huh?

53:02.987 --> 53:04.055
Promise.

53:06.724 --> 53:07.859
I promise.

53:23.974 --> 53:27.045
[grunting, moaning]

53:31.114 --> 53:32.317
This is crazy.

53:33.050 --> 53:35.053
- Yeah, it is.
- [sighs]

53:36.085 --> 53:37.187
Last time.

53:40.324 --> 53:42.193
Good, yeah, I think
that's for the best.

53:45.795 --> 53:47.164
Last time here, Michael.

53:54.204 --> 53:55.840
I don't think I can
do this anymore.

53:56.907 --> 53:58.076
It's wrong.

54:01.811 --> 54:03.847
You'll do this
until I say stop.

54:06.215 --> 54:09.152
Find us a new place.
Not a hotel.

54:14.291 --> 54:16.628
Next time you tell me
this is wrong...

54:17.960 --> 54:20.063
I'll tell Rob Reynolds
that you raped me.

54:22.699 --> 54:24.402
I'm wearing your
DNA right now.

54:26.269 --> 54:27.771
Don't forget that.

54:31.942 --> 54:33.644
Just find a new place.

54:44.054 --> 54:46.354
[scoffs] I just wish
more people knew

54:46.356 --> 54:48.359
how easy it was
to get this video.

54:53.831 --> 54:54.766
You proud of me?

54:55.164 --> 54:57.235
Yeah, I guess.
Jesus, poor dog.

55:02.940 --> 55:03.941
There's more.

55:04.173 --> 55:05.342
What's this?

55:05.876 --> 55:07.208
Peanut butter and roses.

55:07.210 --> 55:09.146
- No, I...
- [laughs] Here.

55:11.114 --> 55:13.815
"You are a true artist
and a great American. RR."

55:13.817 --> 55:15.016
Rob Reynolds, what a guy.

55:15.018 --> 55:16.054
[keys jingle]

55:16.887 --> 55:18.356
Ain't life grand?

55:23.893 --> 55:25.462
Cal, are you sure this is
what you wanna be doing?

55:26.130 --> 55:27.265
Absolutely.

55:29.099 --> 55:30.334
I found my calling.

55:53.990 --> 55:56.193
Michael, Rob wants to
see you in his office.

56:06.503 --> 56:07.536
You wanted to see me?

56:07.538 --> 56:09.072
Michael, come on in.

56:09.338 --> 56:10.306
Oh, John.

56:10.974 --> 56:13.141
Tell Rob what you told me
about racial profiling.

56:13.143 --> 56:14.508
Yes, the senator says

56:14.510 --> 56:16.978
that you have an opinion
about Vonetta Calhoun

56:16.980 --> 56:18.182
that you'd like to share.

56:19.916 --> 56:21.351
We're anxious to hear what.

56:23.019 --> 56:27.358
Uh, yeah, um, I think I said
that the issue is complex.

56:28.090 --> 56:30.090
I also said the people
she's talking about

56:30.092 --> 56:32.864
are more worried about assimilation
and survival than anything else.

56:35.965 --> 56:37.501
Is that it?
Did I leave anything out?

56:37.967 --> 56:40.203
Ah, about
the young voters...

56:40.403 --> 56:42.336
Uh, you can't
attract...

56:42.338 --> 56:45.809
You can't attract young voters
by attacking the way they dress.

56:47.510 --> 56:48.913
Thanks, Michael.

56:54.885 --> 56:57.985
Well, I think
Michael's right,

56:57.987 --> 57:00.524
Vonetta Calhoun is definitely
not the way to go.

57:01.291 --> 57:04.458
She's out of the event,
your rap star buddy is in.

57:04.460 --> 57:05.896
Very good, Senator.

57:07.063 --> 57:08.266
Rob, call me John.

57:18.442 --> 57:21.846
So? How's Cruella de Vil
been treating you?

57:22.445 --> 57:24.347
Uh, with kid gloves.

57:24.614 --> 57:26.183
'Cause she's
afraid of you.

57:26.583 --> 57:28.485
I don't... I don't want
to talk about her.

57:31.121 --> 57:33.090
Guess who just walked in.

57:35.525 --> 57:37.427
What's up, man?
Man.

57:39.128 --> 57:41.865
[sighs] So, what's the good word?
Abstinence.

57:42.199 --> 57:44.231
That's a good word
for people who get laid.

57:44.233 --> 57:46.901
Sadly, for the rest of us,
it's merely a fact of life.

57:46.903 --> 57:48.503
What can
I get you?

57:48.505 --> 57:51.373
Club soda with, actually, just
a little bit of rum in it.

57:51.375 --> 57:53.878
- Okay. Menu?
- No, no, thanks.

57:54.478 --> 57:55.943
So, how's Callie doing?

57:55.945 --> 57:58.382
Don't know.
Fine, I guess. Why?

57:59.048 --> 58:02.018
Tell me, was that a
Doberman or a Rottweiler?

58:03.420 --> 58:05.088
Don't ever play poker.

58:05.422 --> 58:07.458
So, who's she working for,
Jerry Todd?

58:08.492 --> 58:10.294
No, not quite.

58:10.693 --> 58:11.929
Indeed.

58:12.929 --> 58:15.232
The plot thickens.
Okay.

58:15.965 --> 58:18.335
Thank you. I'm gonna have to
order off the menu for this one.

58:18.936 --> 58:20.638
God, I love
dinner theater.

58:23.606 --> 58:24.909
Oh, shit.

58:25.641 --> 58:26.877
It's Darcy.

58:29.445 --> 58:31.114
That's Baines's daughter?

58:34.451 --> 58:35.619
My God.

58:36.652 --> 58:38.421
She's breathtaking.

58:38.621 --> 58:41.389
I mean, not in the "I wanna
fucking bang her" kinda way,

58:41.391 --> 58:47.063
more in the "I wanna hold her and
spoon with her after the fact" way.

58:49.266 --> 58:50.965
Maybe even weep a little.

58:50.967 --> 58:52.032
Hey, man, you mind if a take
rain check on this one?

58:52.034 --> 58:54.168
What...
Dude. What...

58:54.170 --> 58:55.336
- Come on, you just got here.
- I'll see you at the fountain later.

58:55.338 --> 58:56.507
You gotta be kidding me.

59:00.010 --> 59:01.078
Hey.

59:03.579 --> 59:04.547
Give me a ride?

59:23.132 --> 59:24.134
That girl you were with...

59:25.668 --> 59:27.003
she was at your party.

59:29.572 --> 59:31.074
She the one who
told you about me?

59:35.612 --> 59:37.148
Jeannie's an idiot.

59:38.382 --> 59:39.650
What'd she...
What'd she say?

59:46.222 --> 59:47.123
What are you doing?

59:55.065 --> 59:56.666
I can't...
I'm... I can't.

01:00:05.708 --> 01:00:06.743
Fine.

01:01:02.331 --> 01:01:03.366
[Darcy chuckles]

01:01:03.833 --> 01:01:04.734
Come on.

01:02:12.835 --> 01:02:16.106
[keys jingling] [door
unlocks, opens]

01:02:24.181 --> 01:02:25.615
[cell phone buzzing]

01:02:30.219 --> 01:02:32.555
Oh, fuck. Judith.
Fuck.

01:02:33.789 --> 01:02:35.625
Callie?
[cell phone ringing]

01:02:38.762 --> 01:02:40.561
Hey, Callie,
I'm glad you called.

01:02:40.563 --> 01:02:42.532
I'm wondering, can you be out
of the apartment tomorrow...

01:02:45.969 --> 01:02:46.903
What?

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:53.443
[crowd chattering]

01:02:56.313 --> 01:02:58.548
I'm so sorry, you're gonna
be okay, don't worry.

01:03:02.652 --> 01:03:05.489
Callie?
Callie, what happened?

01:03:07.824 --> 01:03:10.927
[crowd chattering]
[hip-hop on speakers]

01:03:31.447 --> 01:03:32.650
Can I help you?

01:03:33.483 --> 01:03:35.686
[people screaming]

01:03:36.286 --> 01:03:37.851
I'm gonna fucking kill
him, you understand me?

01:03:37.853 --> 01:03:38.853
He's dead!

01:03:38.855 --> 01:03:40.320
What are you talking about?

01:03:40.322 --> 01:03:41.588
Why don't you go
fucking ask Rob?

01:03:41.590 --> 01:03:43.423
Rob? Okay, wait,
I'm coming with you.

01:03:43.425 --> 01:03:44.460
No.

01:03:45.728 --> 01:03:47.561
- Don't.
- Callie.

01:03:47.563 --> 01:03:48.865
Get the fuck
away from me!

01:03:53.969 --> 01:03:56.737
[ambulance departs]
[siren wailing]

01:03:56.739 --> 01:03:58.708
[Michael] <i>Rob Reynolds
had been humiliated.</i>

01:04:00.777 --> 01:04:03.677
<i>What he had done to Tanya
he did for personal reasons...</i>

01:04:03.679 --> 01:04:05.280
[people screaming]

01:04:05.282 --> 01:04:06.914
<i>and that made it
all the more unsettling.</i>

01:04:06.916 --> 01:04:09.550
- [woman] Stop it! Stop it!
- <i>Help! Somebody, help!</i>

01:04:09.552 --> 01:04:11.351
[Callie]
They posted it online?

01:04:11.353 --> 01:04:13.354
It's not good enough that they
beat her to a bloody pulp,

01:04:13.356 --> 01:04:15.356
they had to post it
online too?

01:04:15.358 --> 01:04:16.824
There's no way in hell I'm
letting him get away with it.

01:04:16.826 --> 01:04:18.992
I'm taking Tanya,
I'm gonna take her home.

01:04:18.994 --> 01:04:22.463
And then as soon as I get back here,
oh-ho-ho, I'm gonna fix this.

01:04:22.465 --> 01:04:25.432
And then we're getting out of
here for good, so pack your shit!

01:04:25.434 --> 01:04:28.903
What... We? What are you talk... Callie!
What are you talking about?

01:04:28.905 --> 01:04:29.873
Callie!

01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:32.842
Fuck.

01:04:37.614 --> 01:04:40.351
- [knocking]
- [sighs]

01:04:41.818 --> 01:04:43.383
Damn it. Cocksucker.

01:04:43.385 --> 01:04:45.853
Who the fuck is
knocking on my door?

01:04:45.855 --> 01:04:46.956
[knocking continues]

01:04:49.626 --> 01:04:51.428
Oh. Hello, Mother.

01:04:52.762 --> 01:04:54.565
I'm sorry, I think I have
the wrong apartment.

01:04:54.764 --> 01:04:58.568
Are you sure? Because I'm not
the only one that lives here.

01:04:59.369 --> 01:05:00.967
Yeah, I'm sure it's
the wrong apartment.

01:05:00.969 --> 01:05:03.573
Hey, you look familiar.

01:05:04.673 --> 01:05:05.942
Are you a friend
of Michael's?

01:05:06.876 --> 01:05:08.842
No, just a little lost.

01:05:08.844 --> 01:05:11.014
- Maybe I could help.
- No, thank you.

01:05:12.882 --> 01:05:15.019
Okay, well, you have
a blessed day!

01:05:24.059 --> 01:05:26.693
[cell phone ringing]
Michael Lawson.

01:05:26.695 --> 01:05:27.961
Is in big trouble.

01:05:27.963 --> 01:05:29.967
<i>Hey.</i>
Where were you?

01:05:30.367 --> 01:05:33.637
I'm sorry. Reynolds called me into
his office, I lost track of time.

01:05:33.936 --> 01:05:36.639
Who was that annoying girl
that answered your door?

01:05:37.773 --> 01:05:39.374
[softly] Fuck.

01:05:39.376 --> 01:05:41.075
[normal voice]
Uh, that was my roommate.

01:05:41.077 --> 01:05:42.809
<i>She was not supposed
to be there.</i>

01:05:42.811 --> 01:05:43.878
Is she your lover?

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:44.979
No, she's a lesbian.

01:05:44.981 --> 01:05:46.016
Get rid of her.

01:05:46.548 --> 01:05:47.715
Well, I thought I had.

01:05:47.717 --> 01:05:49.320
Just make it happen.

01:05:54.623 --> 01:05:55.892
[cell phone ringing]

01:05:59.094 --> 01:05:59.996
Yeah?

01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:02.465
It's me.
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:06:02.965 --> 01:06:04.500
Well, you were
supposed to clear out.

01:06:04.768 --> 01:06:05.635
Why?

01:06:06.536 --> 01:06:07.671
I think you know why.

01:06:08.103 --> 01:06:10.406
Chanel No. 5?
We met.

01:06:11.173 --> 01:06:12.509
Leave it alone, Cal.

01:06:14.744 --> 01:06:15.813
Look...

01:06:16.012 --> 01:06:17.711
I just have to
drive Tanya home,

01:06:17.713 --> 01:06:20.049
and then you can have the
place all to yourself.

01:06:21.184 --> 01:06:22.419
How is Tanya?

01:06:23.385 --> 01:06:25.855
That should have been
your first concern.

01:06:27.023 --> 01:06:28.759
[dial tone]

01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:14.738
[Todd] This better be good. I was in
the middle of an amazing massage.

01:07:16.172 --> 01:07:18.104
Well...

01:07:18.106 --> 01:07:19.240
I've got something I'm selling
to the highest bidder,

01:07:19.242 --> 01:07:20.608
if you know
what I mean.

01:07:20.610 --> 01:07:22.146
Okay, so what
do you got?

01:07:22.744 --> 01:07:24.177
It will destroy
Rob Reynolds

01:07:24.179 --> 01:07:25.915
and the entire
Baines campaign.

01:07:27.983 --> 01:07:29.420
I might have
an investor.

01:07:30.686 --> 01:07:32.489
You tell me what you have,
I'll tell you what it's worth.

01:07:34.824 --> 01:07:35.992
So, what do you got?

01:07:37.059 --> 01:07:39.563
[chuckling]

01:07:41.030 --> 01:07:42.966
[pop song playing]

01:07:49.706 --> 01:07:51.074
[Darcy] Take me away from here.
[Michael] Huh?

01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:53.109
Take me to your place.

01:07:55.077 --> 01:07:56.480
I can't,
I have a roommate.

01:07:58.014 --> 01:07:59.650
Then take me to a hotel.

01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:01.816
[Michael sighs]

01:08:01.818 --> 01:08:03.120
That's not...

01:08:03.719 --> 01:08:06.521
We can't start sneaking
around like that, Darcy.

01:08:06.523 --> 01:08:07.858
That's just
not a good idea.

01:08:12.528 --> 01:08:15.065
[song continues]
[man singing]

01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:19.102
I should go,
and you should get back.

01:08:20.703 --> 01:08:21.872
[grunts]

01:08:30.011 --> 01:08:32.216
My father is going to make
his announcement tomorrow.

01:08:36.752 --> 01:08:37.819
I know.

01:08:42.091 --> 01:08:43.527
I want you to take me.

01:08:48.698 --> 01:08:50.834
I don't think the
campaign wants that.

01:08:59.676 --> 01:09:00.877
It's what I want.

01:09:03.578 --> 01:09:04.814
[sighs] Darcy.

01:09:21.029 --> 01:09:22.131
I love you.

01:09:26.033 --> 01:09:27.871
[song continues]

01:09:51.327 --> 01:09:52.863
[Michael]
<i>"Darcy, I love you."</i>

01:09:54.296 --> 01:09:55.865
<i>I wanted to say it.</i>

01:09:56.865 --> 01:09:57.967
<i>But I couldn't.</i>

01:10:03.805 --> 01:10:05.274
<i>I was thinking
about Dallas.</i>

01:10:06.208 --> 01:10:07.711
<i>Being in their
kitchen with them.</i>

01:10:09.078 --> 01:10:10.581
<i>Having breakfast together.</i>

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:13.016
<i>Me, Darcy, and Baines.</i>

01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:14.985
<i>How happy they seemed.</i>

01:10:16.351 --> 01:10:18.785
<i>How happy I felt, how...</i>

01:10:18.787 --> 01:10:21.054
I'm not happy.
Jesus Christ!

01:10:21.056 --> 01:10:23.424
What exactly do you think you're doing?
Judith...

01:10:23.426 --> 01:10:25.228
I want this to stop.

01:10:26.328 --> 01:10:27.396
I... I don't know
what you mean.

01:10:28.430 --> 01:10:30.665
You don't know what you're
dealing with, Michael.

01:10:30.667 --> 01:10:32.035
This is not about us.

01:10:33.336 --> 01:10:36.640
This is about Darcy, and she
is an extremely troubled girl.

01:10:37.372 --> 01:10:38.774
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:10:40.710 --> 01:10:41.612
Look...

01:10:42.445 --> 01:10:43.943
You have a future
if you want it,

01:10:43.945 --> 01:10:45.948
you can go on the road
and campaign with John.

01:10:46.282 --> 01:10:48.085
And I promise to
leave you alone.

01:10:48.685 --> 01:10:50.718
But this country
needs my husband,

01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:54.625
and the only thing Darcy will bring
you or this campaign is down.

01:11:01.797 --> 01:11:03.032
What do you mean,
she's troubled?

01:11:07.069 --> 01:11:09.372
She tried to kill me,
that's why she was sent away.

01:11:12.074 --> 01:11:13.376
She tried to kill you.

01:11:15.712 --> 01:11:17.180
- You're fucking lying.
- Look at me.

01:11:21.216 --> 01:11:24.018
When she as 14, she attacked
me at the dinner table.

01:11:24.020 --> 01:11:25.385
Attacked you?
Stabbed me in the hand,

01:11:25.387 --> 01:11:27.356
could've cut me to ribbons
if John hadn't...

01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:31.027
Well, look, something
you may not have noticed.

01:11:37.734 --> 01:11:38.669
Shit.

01:11:44.873 --> 01:11:46.473
[lighter clinks]

01:11:46.475 --> 01:11:48.045
Now, why...
why would she do that?

01:11:48.243 --> 01:11:49.311
I'm not getting into it.

01:11:53.048 --> 01:11:54.184
Why should I
believe you, then?

01:11:59.122 --> 01:12:00.257
I'm through with you.

01:12:01.056 --> 01:12:02.091
With this.

01:12:05.261 --> 01:12:07.297
We won't be seeing each
other anymore, okay?

01:12:10.198 --> 01:12:12.735
And I'm...
I'm sorry I snapped and...

01:12:13.536 --> 01:12:14.837
threatened you, but...

01:12:20.275 --> 01:12:22.045
I felt something
for you and...

01:12:25.081 --> 01:12:26.349
you made me feel ugly.

01:12:30.552 --> 01:12:32.088
Anyway, it's done, and...

01:12:33.122 --> 01:12:36.426
you see the scar and you
know I'm telling the truth.

01:12:44.833 --> 01:12:46.235
You want to run
for Congress, right?

01:12:47.936 --> 01:12:49.038
Am I right?

01:12:53.009 --> 01:12:54.444
We can make that happen.

01:12:56.378 --> 01:12:59.349
But are you willing to make the
necessary sacrifices, Michael?

01:13:03.519 --> 01:13:04.755
Think about it.

01:13:12.929 --> 01:13:13.930
What's up?

01:13:14.963 --> 01:13:16.964
- Billy, come in.
- What's up?

01:13:16.966 --> 01:13:18.365
Come on. Have a seat.

01:13:18.367 --> 01:13:20.302
[indistinct] No, no, it's okay.
Sit down.

01:13:20.569 --> 01:13:24.974
We... have a snitch
at Jerry Todd's office.

01:13:25.274 --> 01:13:28.278
Said someone came to see him,
said she has something...

01:13:29.212 --> 01:13:31.111
that can destroy Baines.

01:13:31.113 --> 01:13:32.513
She?
Who are we talking about?

01:13:32.515 --> 01:13:34.281
Billy,

01:13:34.283 --> 01:13:37.053
there are 270 million guns
in the United States of America.

01:13:40.189 --> 01:13:41.423
And that's one of them.

01:13:44.292 --> 01:13:45.394
Callie?

01:13:47.863 --> 01:13:48.998
Callie, you back?

01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:53.235
[fan blowing]

01:13:57.372 --> 01:13:58.507
Callie?

01:14:11.186 --> 01:14:12.255
[keys jingle]

01:14:29.104 --> 01:14:31.006
[Callie sighs] <i>Michael,</i>

01:14:31.407 --> 01:14:33.543
<i>I wanted to let you know
that I am leaving</i>

01:14:34.176 --> 01:14:36.509
<i>because you have broken my heart</i>

01:14:36.511 --> 01:14:38.414
<i>and now I feel
the need to save you.</i>

01:14:39.015 --> 01:14:40.383
<i>And make some serious money.</i>

01:14:41.016 --> 01:14:43.586
<i>So... Well...</i>

01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:46.022
<i>I recorded you
with Judith Baines.</i>

01:14:47.355 --> 01:14:49.389
[laughs]
<i>I'm kind of surprised...</i>

01:14:49.391 --> 01:14:50.894
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- <i>...she'd have sex with you here.</i>

01:14:51.327 --> 01:14:53.230
- <i>But, um...</i>
- Oh, fuck!

01:14:53.561 --> 01:14:54.631
<i>at the
end of the day...</i>

01:14:56.532 --> 01:14:59.569
<i>I forgive you,
she was clearly using you.</i>

01:14:59.969 --> 01:15:02.001
<i>I mean, we'll split the money.</i>

01:15:02.003 --> 01:15:03.273
<i>You know, head off somewhere
together like we always said.</i>

01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:07.243
<i>...a interesting video and I'm going
to sell it to the highest bidder.</i>

01:15:07.609 --> 01:15:11.378
<i>Now, this is partially both of our
faults, but what were you thinking?</i>

01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:14.481
[sighs] <i>I mean, I
forgive you, all right?</i>

01:15:14.483 --> 01:15:16.453
<i>I forgive you for
you losing your way.</i>

01:15:17.052 --> 01:15:19.218
- [blowing]
- <i>I have to do this for both of us, okay?</i>

01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:20.620
<i>I mean, we'll split
the money...</i>

01:15:20.622 --> 01:15:22.157
- [whispers] Where'd you go?
- <i>...and...</i>

01:15:23.259 --> 01:15:25.291
<i>You know, we'll go off somewhere
together, like we always talked about.</i>

01:15:25.293 --> 01:15:27.061
<i>We can be completely different people...</i>
Oh, fuck.

01:15:27.063 --> 01:15:28.097
<i>...do something so much...</i>

01:15:32.268 --> 01:15:34.003
[tones beeping]

01:15:39.542 --> 01:15:40.477
Hello.

01:15:44.447 --> 01:15:45.582
Check the windows.

01:15:46.548 --> 01:15:48.251
Michael, Michael, Michael.

01:15:49.318 --> 01:15:50.517
[line ringing]

01:15:50.519 --> 01:15:52.188
Come on, Michael,
pick up the phone.

01:15:52.988 --> 01:15:55.257
Come on, Callie. Pick up.
Pick the fuck up.

01:15:56.591 --> 01:15:59.259
[busy signal]
Fuck. Fuck! Fuck, fuck!

01:15:59.261 --> 01:16:00.563
[cell phone ringing]

01:16:04.265 --> 01:16:05.234
Hello?

01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:07.369
Michael,
where are you?

01:16:09.171 --> 01:16:11.541
Rob, I'm sorry.
I'm handling this.

01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:13.676
Handling what?

01:16:14.275 --> 01:16:16.680
- I'm not stupid.
- No, I am.

01:16:17.412 --> 01:16:19.345
What do you want?
I'm willing to pay.

01:16:19.347 --> 01:16:21.251
This was not me, I had nothing
to do with this, Rob.

01:16:21.449 --> 01:16:24.987
Really? 'Cause from what I'm
hearing, you play a major role.

01:16:25.186 --> 01:16:27.090
I'm taking care of this,
I promise.

01:16:27.288 --> 01:16:29.960
Where are you, Michael? Where's Callie?
I need to talk to her.

01:16:33.029 --> 01:16:34.097
Fuck.

01:17:06.529 --> 01:17:08.598
[rock on car stereo]

01:17:11.533 --> 01:17:12.568
[engine off]
[music off]

01:17:41.396 --> 01:17:43.263
- Shh! Shh!
- Michael!

01:17:43.265 --> 01:17:44.764
What the fuck
are you doing?

01:17:44.766 --> 01:17:45.734
What the fuck am I doing?
What the fuck are you doing?

01:17:46.335 --> 01:17:48.602
- We need to leave.
- No, no,

01:17:48.604 --> 01:17:50.640
you need to give me that drive, you need to
give me the camera, you need to erase...

01:17:51.172 --> 01:17:53.242
You need to erase that fucking
tape off of wherever else it is.

01:17:53.641 --> 01:17:55.476
- [scoffs]
- Callie!

01:17:55.478 --> 01:17:56.442
What?
Callie.

01:17:56.444 --> 01:17:57.611
- What?
- Callie.

01:17:57.613 --> 01:17:59.479
- Please.
- What is your problem?

01:17:59.481 --> 01:18:01.180
You gotta give me
every copy you...

01:18:01.182 --> 01:18:02.585
- [Darcy] Every copy of what, Michael?
- Why?

01:18:09.891 --> 01:18:11.293
Michael, who is this?

01:18:14.296 --> 01:18:15.365
This is Callie.

01:18:16.431 --> 01:18:19.202
Callie, this is Darcy,
Senator Baines's daughter.

01:18:20.668 --> 01:18:22.238
[laughing]

01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:26.076
Oh, that's fucking...

01:18:26.876 --> 01:18:29.445
[clears throat] I'm an
old friend of Michael's.

01:18:35.650 --> 01:18:36.519
What is this?

01:18:37.353 --> 01:18:38.621
I'm here to take you
to the announcement.

01:18:39.622 --> 01:18:42.325
That's for Judith,
actually.

01:18:45.161 --> 01:18:46.296
Michael,
what's going on?

01:18:47.262 --> 01:18:48.398
[Callie] I need to leave.

01:18:50.399 --> 01:18:51.634
Michael, are you
coming with me?

01:18:58.640 --> 01:18:59.708
Michael?

01:19:01.710 --> 01:19:02.645
No.

01:19:08.617 --> 01:19:09.750
Oh.

01:19:09.752 --> 01:19:12.655
Okay.
Suit yourself.

01:19:14.722 --> 01:19:16.259
I'll see you later.

01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:19.362
'Cause you're
gonna call me.

01:19:20.762 --> 01:19:22.228
We should go.

01:19:22.230 --> 01:19:24.199
[car door opens]
To the announcement?

01:19:24.667 --> 01:19:25.702
Inside.

01:19:28.203 --> 01:19:30.840
[engine starts]
[rock on car stereo]

01:19:33.242 --> 01:19:34.641
[tires screeching]

01:19:34.643 --> 01:19:37.346
- [audience cheering]
- [Baines] Thank you.

01:19:41.483 --> 01:19:42.619
Thank you.

01:19:44.787 --> 01:19:46.655
Thank you, thank you.

01:19:47.823 --> 01:19:49.822
Thank you,
thank you very much.

01:19:49.824 --> 01:19:51.991
It is an honor to be
here with you today.

01:19:51.993 --> 01:19:54.363
[inaudible]
I'm humbled by the experience.

01:19:54.863 --> 01:19:58.201
I don't need to tell you
that we live in trying times.

01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:00.702
Challenges facing
our great country,

01:20:00.935 --> 01:20:03.840
rising unemployment,
runaway inflation,

01:20:04.739 --> 01:20:06.475
diminishing opportunities

01:20:06.708 --> 01:20:09.912
are tearing at the very fabric
of our American families.

01:20:10.311 --> 01:20:13.216
And I know how important
family is to all of us.

01:20:13.414 --> 01:20:15.417
[Judith moaning on video]

01:20:27.662 --> 01:20:29.765
Was this before or
after we were together?

01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:40.442
[gasps, shudders]

01:20:41.976 --> 01:20:45.581
The United Party
is a conservative party.

01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:48.384
We share the same
core values.

01:20:49.585 --> 01:20:52.285
We can embrace
traditional morals

01:20:52.287 --> 01:20:54.353
without falling prey
to bigotry.

01:20:54.355 --> 01:20:56.291
- [applause]
- We can.

01:21:01.529 --> 01:21:04.000
Or worse...
Or worse...

01:21:05.533 --> 01:21:10.706
allowing bigots to hide behind
our honestly held principles.

01:21:11.372 --> 01:21:13.440
[water running]

01:21:13.442 --> 01:21:14.543
[Michael] Darcy.

01:21:17.845 --> 01:21:19.381
You promised me.

01:21:21.949 --> 01:21:23.583
I didn't know Callie
was filming us.

01:21:23.585 --> 01:21:24.787
[water off]

01:21:27.055 --> 01:21:29.692
We want God
and we want faith.

01:21:29.957 --> 01:21:33.927
We don't want fear, and heaven
knows, we've had too much hate.

01:21:33.929 --> 01:21:35.698
[cheering]

01:21:37.498 --> 01:21:39.335
And we have room...

01:21:39.768 --> 01:21:44.306
We have room for everyone,
because we are everyone.

01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:47.540
Everyone who has
ever worked hard,

01:21:47.542 --> 01:21:49.643
everyone who has
ever pushed open

01:21:49.645 --> 01:21:51.714
the doors of opportunity
for themselves.

01:21:52.046 --> 01:21:53.982
We believe in
the American dream!

01:21:56.351 --> 01:21:57.753
We believe in America!

01:22:02.957 --> 01:22:04.293
Leave.

01:22:10.932 --> 01:22:12.402
Use the back door.

01:22:14.869 --> 01:22:16.639
That's what we tell
the help to do.

01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:20.476
[cheering]

01:22:24.512 --> 01:22:26.812
As a member of
the United Party,

01:22:26.814 --> 01:22:29.451
I, John Boland Baines,

01:22:29.650 --> 01:22:31.386
announce my candidacy

01:22:31.987 --> 01:22:34.724
for president of
the United States of America.

01:22:37.792 --> 01:22:39.027
Thank you.

01:22:45.768 --> 01:22:46.969
Thank you!

01:22:50.072 --> 01:22:54.007
[chanting] Baines! Baines!
Baines! Baines! Baines!

01:22:54.009 --> 01:22:55.608
[Baines] The United Party!

01:22:55.610 --> 01:22:57.811
Baines! Baines!
Baines! Baines! Baines!

01:22:57.813 --> 01:22:59.349
I have to take care
of something.

01:22:59.814 --> 01:23:03.685
Baines! Baines! Baines!
Baines! Baines! Baines!

01:23:04.118 --> 01:23:05.121
[Baines]
Thank you!

01:23:06.322 --> 01:23:08.687
Thank you! [Judith] Do you
think Michael was in on it?

01:23:08.689 --> 01:23:10.826
[Rob] I don't know, but it doesn't
really matter now, does it?

01:23:11.193 --> 01:23:13.829
Where is he? I was hoping
you could tell me.

01:23:19.100 --> 01:23:22.003
[cell phone rings]
Yeah?

01:24:08.817 --> 01:24:10.051
Wait here.

01:24:18.627 --> 01:24:19.729
Darcy?

01:24:21.128 --> 01:24:22.064
Darcy?

01:24:24.632 --> 01:24:25.701
I'm in here.

01:24:36.545 --> 01:24:37.947
Oh, there he is.
Come here.

01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:39.182
Rob. Rob. The fuck you
think you're doin', huh?

01:24:39.581 --> 01:24:41.214
Fuck is wrong
with you, huh?

01:24:41.216 --> 01:24:42.214
Calm down, Rob. You wanna
fucking ruin everything?

01:24:42.216 --> 01:24:43.752
You and that dyke cunt.

01:24:49.524 --> 01:24:50.460
Darcy.

01:24:52.761 --> 01:24:53.763
What?

01:24:55.831 --> 01:24:57.033
We need to talk.

01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:00.002
Where's Michael?

01:25:04.273 --> 01:25:05.807
Michael's on the TV.

01:25:08.944 --> 01:25:09.846
Darcy.

01:25:13.948 --> 01:25:15.016
Darcy.

01:25:17.586 --> 01:25:19.922
No, no, no.

01:25:20.154 --> 01:25:22.123
Okay, you need
to calm down.

01:25:22.724 --> 01:25:24.659
It's okay,
just please calm down.

01:25:25.293 --> 01:25:26.828
No, Darcy.

01:25:27.029 --> 01:25:28.961
Darcy!

01:25:28.963 --> 01:25:30.263
I'm gonna take care of this.
You don't think I'll crush you?

01:25:30.265 --> 01:25:33.169
- [Judith] Darcy, no!
- [blow lands]

01:25:39.207 --> 01:25:40.839

- [stabs]

[Darcy gasps, whimpers]

01:25:43.011 --> 01:25:44.247
Oh, my God.

01:25:44.979 --> 01:25:47.179
Oh, my God.
[breathing heavily]

01:25:47.181 --> 01:25:49.184
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

01:25:49.984 --> 01:25:50.916
[screams]

01:25:50.918 --> 01:25:51.921
[Judith] Oh, my God.

01:25:52.119 --> 01:25:53.756
[sobbing] No!

01:25:55.823 --> 01:25:57.960
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
No, no, no!

01:26:00.895 --> 01:26:02.297
- Oh, my God.
- No, no, no!

01:26:04.099 --> 01:26:05.197
Judith?

01:26:05.199 --> 01:26:06.702
Why, Michael?

01:26:09.070 --> 01:26:10.736
[Darcy] Michael!
[Rob] What happened?

01:26:10.738 --> 01:26:11.840
Fuck!

01:26:12.841 --> 01:26:14.741
Fuck.
[Darcy] I'm sorry.

01:26:14.743 --> 01:26:16.646
- [Judith] Darcy, put down the knife.
- [Rob] No, no.

01:26:16.845 --> 01:26:18.812
Darcy, give me the knife.

01:26:18.814 --> 01:26:20.550
No! We have to take him to the hospital.
Give me the knife!

01:26:21.617 --> 01:26:22.585
[Darcy] Michael!

01:26:22.818 --> 01:26:25.184
Darcy, listen to me, Darcy!

01:26:25.186 --> 01:26:28.120
Listen to me, you're gonna have to
listen to me, okay, both of you.

01:26:28.122 --> 01:26:29.692
Darcy, listen to him.

01:26:56.652 --> 01:26:57.819
Open it.

01:27:01.288 --> 01:27:02.992
[cartridge clatters]
[pistol cocks]

01:27:05.993 --> 01:27:07.861
[Michael] Oh.

01:27:07.863 --> 01:27:09.798
They're gonna get you an ambulance
and you're gonna be okay.

01:27:10.032 --> 01:27:11.363
You're gonna be okay,
I promise!

01:27:11.365 --> 01:27:13.135
You're gonna be all right.

01:27:13.702 --> 01:27:17.106
Michael, okay, you're gonna
be all right, I promise.

01:27:17.305 --> 01:27:19.205
Put him in the car.
[Michael groaning]

01:27:19.207 --> 01:27:21.307
No, no, he needs
an ambulance.

01:27:21.309 --> 01:27:23.677
Darcy, you have
to trust Rob.

01:27:23.679 --> 01:27:26.012
You're gonna have
to trust Rob.

01:27:26.014 --> 01:27:30.353
- We have to trust Rob.
- [Rob screaming]

01:27:58.479 --> 01:28:00.115
Todd shit his pants.

01:28:01.484 --> 01:28:03.215
He's probably still in the parking
garage counting the 10,000.

01:28:03.217 --> 01:28:04.185
Good.

01:28:05.153 --> 01:28:06.389
Callie?

01:28:08.756 --> 01:28:11.991
That flash drive she had,
that the only one, Michael?

01:28:11.993 --> 01:28:13.393
[Michael] Anything
happens to me,

gets a package.

01:28:18.734 --> 01:28:19.802
You're full of shit.

01:28:29.944 --> 01:28:31.410
Were gonna drop him
on the side of the road.

01:28:31.412 --> 01:28:32.847
Wait, what?

01:28:34.082 --> 01:28:35.851
Call 911 with your dummy phone
and they'll come get him.

01:28:36.083 --> 01:28:38.250
They'll take you to the
hospital, fix you up.

01:28:38.252 --> 01:28:39.518
Can you hold on
for that long?

01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:41.389
I don't know,
I don't know.

01:28:41.823 --> 01:28:44.694
And when the cops come,
you tell them

01:28:45.025 --> 01:28:48.029
the person who stabbed
you was male Caucasian.

01:28:48.395 --> 01:28:50.432
- Darcy?
- You understand, Michael?

01:28:53.301 --> 01:28:54.403
Yes.

01:28:55.871 --> 01:28:57.707
[Rob] Get his watch and
his wallet, everything.

01:29:06.347 --> 01:29:08.751
I should have gone with
him to the hospital.

01:29:09.384 --> 01:29:10.920
Rob will take care of it.

01:29:13.921 --> 01:29:16.255
It was an accident,
I wasn't trying...

01:29:16.257 --> 01:29:17.859
Are you gonna help me?

01:29:18.359 --> 01:29:19.961
Are you gonna
help your father?

01:29:21.229 --> 01:29:23.065
Is he gonna send
me away again?

01:29:25.567 --> 01:29:26.868
Look at me.

01:29:27.802 --> 01:29:28.970
Look at me.

01:29:30.104 --> 01:29:32.774
No one is getting sent
away, do you understand?

01:29:38.412 --> 01:29:40.214
No one is getting
sent away.

01:29:44.286 --> 01:29:46.822
We are gonna be
the First fucking Family.

01:29:56.398 --> 01:29:57.867
Now, go get a mop.

01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:07.408
[Rob] We play this right...

01:30:08.844 --> 01:30:10.212
You listening, Michael?

01:30:11.279 --> 01:30:13.482
- Mmm-hmm.
- Play this right,

01:30:14.349 --> 01:30:15.317
and we all win.

01:30:17.953 --> 01:30:18.918
Callie.

01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:19.922
No.

01:30:20.287 --> 01:30:21.322
Darcy.

01:30:22.356 --> 01:30:23.958
You think about Darcy.

01:30:47.948 --> 01:30:49.317
- Hey.
- [chuckles]

01:30:50.118 --> 01:30:52.955
Ah, a declaration of
your love for me?

01:30:54.389 --> 01:30:56.990
Your friend Michael,
the good-looking one,

01:30:56.992 --> 01:30:59.360
he dropped this off, told
me to give it to you.

01:31:10.104 --> 01:31:11.905
[Michael] <i>Dear Kevin,</i>

01:31:11.907 --> 01:31:13.272
<i>There's a very good chance
that after tonight</i>

01:31:13.274 --> 01:31:14.576
<i>you will not see me again.</i>

01:31:16.610 --> 01:31:19.448
<i>If that is the case, do your
old college roommate a solid.</i>

01:31:22.117 --> 01:31:25.421
<i>When the time is right,
tell Darcy Baines I'm sorry.</i>

01:31:25.654 --> 01:31:27.890
<i>And that I never meant to
hurt her or her father.</i>

01:31:29.024 --> 01:31:30.226
<i>Tell her what I couldn't.</i>

01:31:31.292 --> 01:31:33.558
<i>That I loved her,</i>

01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:35.197
<i>and that the happiest moments
of my life were spent with her.</i>

01:31:39.667 --> 01:31:41.237
[ragged breathing]

01:31:51.979 --> 01:31:54.148
<i>That's all the details
you get, my friend.</i>

01:32:00.154 --> 01:32:02.056
<i>I was gonna be
a player in this town...</i>

01:32:03.324 --> 01:32:05.461
<i>and Callie,
Callie was gonna...</i>

01:32:07.228 --> 01:32:09.364
<i>Well, needless to say...</i>

01:32:09.997 --> 01:32:11.532
<i>it hasn't worked out.</i>

01:32:20.608 --> 01:32:22.043

01:32:26.547 --> 01:32:28.917
