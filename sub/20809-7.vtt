00:01.302 --> 00:03.035
- Previously
on "AllStars..."

00:03.037 --> 00:04.003
You need to create
merchandise

00:04.004 --> 00:04.970
- Previously
on "AllStars..."

00:04.972 --> 00:06.939
worthy of your unique
AllStar brand.

00:06.940 --> 00:08.907
- Previously
on "AllStars..."

00:09.643 --> 00:11.310
Alaska.

00:11.312 --> 00:12.678
- Anus-thing is possible.

00:12.679 --> 00:14.045
Alaska.

00:14.048 --> 00:14.680
- You really
sort of captured

00:14.681 --> 00:15.313
Alaska.

00:15.316 --> 00:16.916
that sort of pretentious
1990s perfume ad.

00:16.917 --> 00:18.517
Alaska.

00:18.519 --> 00:18.784
- Katya.

00:18.785 --> 00:19.050
Alaska.

00:19.053 --> 00:19.985
- Your commercial,
your product, and your look

00:19.986 --> 00:20.918
Alaska.

00:20.921 --> 00:22.021
are on brand.
- Thank you.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.122
Alaska.

00:23.124 --> 00:23.673
- Tatianna.

00:23.674 --> 00:24.223
Alaska.

00:24.225 --> 00:24.824
- What you didn't do

00:24.825 --> 00:25.424
Alaska.

00:25.426 --> 00:26.375
is really feature
the product.

00:26.376 --> 00:27.325
Alaska.

00:27.328 --> 00:27.993
- Choices.

00:27.994 --> 00:28.659
Alaska.

00:28.662 --> 00:29.278
- Roxxxy Andrews.

00:29.279 --> 00:29.895
Alaska.

00:29.897 --> 00:31.030
- Losing the hair, it's almost
like when you see it once

00:31.031 --> 00:32.164
Alaska.

00:32.166 --> 00:32.581
and it's really funny,

00:32.582 --> 00:32.997
Alaska.

00:33.000 --> 00:33.682
the next time it's like,
oh, okay,

00:33.683 --> 00:34.365
Alaska.

00:34.368 --> 00:35.601
and made it
a little bit forgetful.

00:35.602 --> 00:36.835
Alaska.

00:36.837 --> 00:37.536
- Alaska.

00:37.537 --> 00:38.236
Alaska.

00:38.239 --> 00:39.338
You are a winner, baby.

00:39.339 --> 00:40.438
Alaska.

00:40.441 --> 00:41.757
- Thank you.
(applause)

00:41.758 --> 00:43.074
Alaska.

00:43.077 --> 00:44.376
- Which queen
have you chosen

00:44.377 --> 00:45.676
Alaska.

00:45.679 --> 00:46.478
to get the chop?

00:46.479 --> 00:47.278
Alaska.

00:47.281 --> 00:48.731
- One of these queens
week after week

00:48.732 --> 00:50.182
Alaska.

00:50.184 --> 00:51.600
has brought
a level of prestige

00:51.601 --> 00:53.017
Alaska.

00:53.020 --> 00:54.904
and beauty and excellence
to this runway.

00:54.905 --> 00:56.789
Alaska.

00:56.791 --> 00:57.406
One of these queens
is the very person

00:57.407 --> 00:58.022
Alaska.

00:58.025 --> 00:59.858
who leant me this very shirt
that I'm wearing tonight.

00:59.859 --> 01:01.692
Alaska.

01:01.695 --> 01:02.561
So based on that,

01:02.562 --> 01:03.428
Alaska.

01:03.431 --> 01:04.797
I've chosen...

01:04.798 --> 01:06.164
Alaska.

01:06.167 --> 01:07.099
Tatianna.

01:07.100 --> 01:08.032
Alaska.

01:10.237 --> 01:14.039
- Tatianna, sashay away.

01:14.041 --> 01:14.907
- Thank you.

01:14.908 --> 01:15.774
- Tatianna, sashay away.

01:25.152 --> 01:26.218
- (sighs)

01:26.220 --> 01:27.186
(exhales)

01:27.187 --> 01:28.153
- (sighs)

01:28.155 --> 01:29.872
"Had a blast.
Love you all.

01:29.873 --> 01:31.590
- (sighs)

01:31.592 --> 01:32.458
Thanks, Tati."

01:32.459 --> 01:33.325
- (sighs)

01:33.327 --> 01:34.059
We love you, Tatianna.

01:34.060 --> 01:34.792
- (sighs)

01:34.795 --> 01:35.628
(applause)

01:35.629 --> 01:36.462
- (sighs)

01:36.464 --> 01:37.630
- Thank you
for saving me again.

01:37.631 --> 01:38.797
- (sighs)

01:38.799 --> 01:39.682
- I love your pussy, girl.

01:39.683 --> 01:40.566
- (sighs)

01:40.568 --> 01:41.867
I know that it appears

01:41.868 --> 01:43.167
- (sighs)

01:43.170 --> 01:46.088
that there's some sort of
Rolaskatox blood oath pact.

01:46.089 --> 01:49.007
- (sighs)

01:49.009 --> 01:49.742
It's really not that.

01:49.743 --> 01:50.476
- (sighs)

01:50.478 --> 01:52.328
I mean, is it fair
to let someone advance

01:52.329 --> 01:54.179
- (sighs)

01:54.181 --> 01:54.963
who hasn't been here
the whole time?

01:54.964 --> 01:55.746
- (sighs)

01:55.749 --> 01:56.932
Tatianna
went away for two weeks,

01:56.933 --> 01:58.116
- (sighs)

01:58.119 --> 02:00.036
and Roxxxy lent me
the shirt that I'm wearing.

02:00.037 --> 02:01.954
- (sighs)

02:01.956 --> 02:02.822
How could I send her home?

02:02.823 --> 02:03.689
- (sighs)

02:03.691 --> 02:05.424
So Adorde--
I mean Katya--

02:05.425 --> 02:07.158
- (sighs)

02:07.161 --> 02:07.626
- Oh, my God, bye.

02:07.627 --> 02:08.092
- (sighs)

02:08.095 --> 02:09.495
- Do you have a lipstick
in your titty or something?

02:09.496 --> 02:10.896
- (sighs)

02:10.898 --> 02:12.147
- I chose Roxxxy.

02:12.148 --> 02:13.397
- (sighs)

02:16.036 --> 02:16.869
Here's the thing.

02:16.871 --> 02:17.636
When I was talking
to Tatianna,

02:17.637 --> 02:18.402
Here's the thing.

02:18.405 --> 02:19.621
like, she--
there was like a fire.

02:19.622 --> 02:20.838
Here's the thing.

02:20.841 --> 02:22.091
I was, like, I want
to see more of that.

02:22.092 --> 02:23.342
Here's the thing.

02:23.344 --> 02:24.143
I know you know
it's nothing personal.

02:24.144 --> 02:24.943
Here's the thing.

02:24.945 --> 02:25.978
- Not at all.
But I do want you to know

02:25.979 --> 02:27.012
Here's the thing.

02:27.014 --> 02:28.314
that I have drive,
I do care,

02:28.315 --> 02:29.615
Here's the thing.

02:29.617 --> 02:30.216
I want to be here.

02:30.217 --> 02:30.816
Here's the thing.

02:30.818 --> 02:31.550
So I want you all
to know that.

02:31.551 --> 02:32.283
Here's the thing.

02:32.286 --> 02:33.018
I can't blame her.

02:33.019 --> 02:33.751
Here's the thing.

02:33.754 --> 02:34.687
I've been in the bottom
four times.

02:34.688 --> 02:35.621
Here's the thing.

02:35.623 --> 02:37.356
But all I can do is prove
why the girls have kept me here

02:37.357 --> 02:39.090
Here's the thing.

02:39.093 --> 02:40.709
and try to pull off a win.

02:40.710 --> 02:42.326
Here's the thing.

02:42.329 --> 02:43.345
- So two wins.

02:43.346 --> 02:44.362
Here's the thing.

02:44.365 --> 02:44.864
- Two-two.

02:44.865 --> 02:45.364
Here's the thing.

02:45.366 --> 02:46.348
- How many for you, D?
- Two.

02:46.349 --> 02:47.331
Here's the thing.

02:47.334 --> 02:48.534
I have been
grandslamming everything,

02:48.535 --> 02:49.735
Here's the thing.

02:49.737 --> 02:51.153
and killing every runway
runway that I step on,

02:51.154 --> 02:52.570
Here's the thing.

02:52.573 --> 02:53.973
And to continue to be just safe
is kind of irritating.

02:53.974 --> 02:55.374
Here's the thing.

02:55.376 --> 02:56.942
It's like you think of fucking
store bought roll-up tape

02:56.943 --> 02:58.509
Here's the thing.

02:58.512 --> 02:59.695
is more genius
than a talking trash can

02:59.696 --> 03:00.879
Here's the thing.

03:00.881 --> 03:01.947
or a spray bottle
that has nothing in it?

03:01.948 --> 03:03.014
Here's the thing.

03:03.017 --> 03:04.500
You know what I mean?
It's frustrating to me.

03:04.501 --> 03:05.984
Here's the thing.

03:05.986 --> 03:06.752
Four, though. I mean...

03:06.753 --> 03:07.519
Here's the thing.

03:07.521 --> 03:08.737
- Girl, yes.
I'll be honest.

03:08.738 --> 03:09.954
Here's the thing.

03:09.957 --> 03:11.757
I feel good about my position
in the competition.

03:11.758 --> 03:13.558
Here's the thing.

03:13.561 --> 03:14.493
- Two for me, and Roxxxy?
- One.

03:14.494 --> 03:15.426
Here's the thing.

03:15.429 --> 03:16.979
I wish I won
that lipsync, though.

03:16.980 --> 03:18.530
Here's the thing.

03:18.532 --> 03:19.615
- I'm sorry.

03:19.616 --> 03:20.699
Here's the thing.

03:20.701 --> 03:21.884
I'm sure
that there's some hos

03:21.885 --> 03:23.068
Here's the thing.

03:23.070 --> 03:24.453
who would love
to get me out of the way.

03:24.454 --> 03:25.837
Here's the thing.

03:25.839 --> 03:27.422
I feel like
Jessica Rabbit. Uh!

03:27.423 --> 03:29.006
Here's the thing.

03:29.009 --> 03:30.292
I would want
to get me out of the way

03:30.293 --> 03:31.576
Here's the thing.

03:31.579 --> 03:32.595
if I was up against me.

03:32.596 --> 03:33.612
Here's the thing.

03:33.614 --> 03:34.830
Luckily I am me.

03:34.831 --> 03:36.047
Here's the thing.

03:38.085 --> 03:40.485
Sorry about that.

03:42.089 --> 03:45.190
- The winner of "RuPaul's
Drag Race AllStars"

03:45.192 --> 03:45.891
receives a one year supply

03:45.892 --> 03:46.591

03:46.594 --> 03:47.710
of Anastasia Beverly Hills
cosmetics,

03:47.711 --> 03:48.827

03:48.829 --> 03:50.396
a coveted spot
in the Drag Race Hall of Fame,

03:50.397 --> 03:51.964
- The winner of "RuPaul's

03:51.966 --> 03:53.532
and a cash prize
of $100,000.

03:53.533 --> 03:55.099
- The winner of "RuPaul's

03:55.102 --> 03:57.102
With extra special
guest judge Aubrey Plaza.

03:57.103 --> 03:59.103

03:59.639 --> 04:00.171

¶ Best woman win ¶

04:03.093 --> 04:04.576
- The winner of "RuPaul's
Drag Race AllStars"

04:08.148 --> 04:09.548
- Top five.

04:09.550 --> 04:10.099
- Oh.

04:10.100 --> 04:10.649
- Top five.

04:10.651 --> 04:11.417
- We made it.

04:11.418 --> 04:12.184
- Top five.

04:12.186 --> 04:13.052
- Hello, hello, hello.

04:13.053 --> 04:13.919
- Top five.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.154
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:15.155 --> 04:16.388
- Top five.

04:16.390 --> 04:16.972
- Ladies.

04:16.973 --> 04:17.555
- Top five.

04:17.558 --> 04:18.757
Now, queens, as gay people,

04:18.758 --> 04:19.957
- Top five.

04:19.960 --> 04:20.526
we get to choose
our families.

04:20.527 --> 04:21.093
- Top five.

04:21.095 --> 04:23.312
Because sometimes
the families we grew up with

04:23.313 --> 04:25.530
- Top five.

04:25.532 --> 04:26.214
don't understand us.

04:26.215 --> 04:26.897
- Top five.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.016
So when I recently
reached out

04:28.017 --> 04:29.133
- Top five.

04:29.136 --> 04:31.320
with an invitation
to your moms and sisters,

04:31.321 --> 04:33.505
- Top five.

04:33.507 --> 04:35.424
I'm sorry to say
that not one of them

04:35.425 --> 04:37.342
- Top five.

04:37.344 --> 04:38.460
accepted my invitation.

04:38.461 --> 04:39.577
- Top five.

04:45.252 --> 04:46.518
They all did.

04:46.520 --> 04:47.152
- Aah! (laughs)

04:47.153 --> 04:47.785
They all did.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.556
- So let's give a big
"Drag Race" family welcome

04:50.557 --> 04:53.325
They all did.

04:53.327 --> 04:55.394
to Alyssa's sister Tabatha.

04:55.395 --> 04:57.462
They all did.

04:57.464 --> 04:59.431
- Oh, my God! Yeah!

04:59.432 --> 05:01.399
They all did.

05:01.402 --> 05:02.434
- (laughs)

05:02.435 --> 05:03.467
They all did.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.320
- Alaska's mom Pam.

05:05.321 --> 05:07.171
They all did.

05:07.174 --> 05:08.040
(laughter and applause)

05:08.041 --> 05:08.907
They all did.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.275
- Oh, my God!

05:10.276 --> 05:11.642
They all did.

05:11.645 --> 05:12.144
- How are you?

05:12.145 --> 05:12.644
They all did.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.296
There's RuPaul.

05:14.297 --> 05:15.947
They all did.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.466
- Detox's sister Heather.

05:17.467 --> 05:18.984
They all did.

05:18.986 --> 05:19.818
- Yes!

05:19.819 --> 05:20.651
They all did.

05:20.654 --> 05:21.687
- Seeing my sister
walk into the workroom

05:21.688 --> 05:22.721
They all did.

05:22.723 --> 05:24.356
is stirring up
all these emotions

05:24.357 --> 05:25.990
They all did.

05:25.993 --> 05:26.842
because just last week

05:26.843 --> 05:27.692
They all did.

05:27.695 --> 05:28.794
it was the anniversary
of my father's passing.

05:28.795 --> 05:29.894
They all did.

05:29.897 --> 05:31.297
So that's been on my mind
a lot lately,

05:31.298 --> 05:32.698
They all did.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.383
and to have my heart
and my soul, my best friend,

05:34.384 --> 05:36.067
They all did.

05:36.070 --> 05:36.569
it's like a godsend.

05:36.570 --> 05:37.069
They all did.

05:37.071 --> 05:38.470
My heart is like fucking
beating out of my chest.

05:38.471 --> 05:39.870
They all did.

05:39.873 --> 05:42.257
- And we have
Katya's mother Pat.

05:42.258 --> 05:44.642
They all did.

05:44.645 --> 05:46.278
- (laughs)

05:46.279 --> 05:47.912
They all did.

05:47.915 --> 05:48.614
My mom!

05:48.615 --> 05:49.314
They all did.

05:49.316 --> 05:51.016
I hate that fucking cunt.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.717
They all did.

05:53.320 --> 05:54.152
No. Just kidding.

05:54.154 --> 05:56.188
- And Roxxxy's grandmother
Sonia.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.223
No. Just kidding.

05:58.225 --> 05:59.141
- Oh!

05:59.142 --> 06:00.058
No. Just kidding.

06:00.060 --> 06:00.826
- Roxxxy!

06:00.827 --> 06:01.593
No. Just kidding.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.479
(laughter and applause)

06:03.480 --> 06:05.364
No. Just kidding.

06:05.366 --> 06:06.966
- Welcome, you beautiful,
beautiful women.

06:06.967 --> 06:08.567
No. Just kidding.

06:08.569 --> 06:09.785
You guys are the reason
we are here,

06:09.786 --> 06:11.002
No. Just kidding.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.371
and I thank
each and every one of you.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.739
No. Just kidding.

06:13.741 --> 06:14.807
Thank you.
Now, queens.

06:14.808 --> 06:15.874
No. Just kidding.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.459
You need to transform
your loved one

06:17.460 --> 06:19.043
No. Just kidding.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.497
into a member
of your royal drag family.

06:21.498 --> 06:23.949
No. Just kidding.

06:23.951 --> 06:24.500
(all laugh)

06:24.501 --> 06:25.050
No. Just kidding.

06:25.052 --> 06:28.303
All while using Anastasia
of Beverly Hills cosmetics.

06:28.304 --> 06:31.555
No. Just kidding.

06:31.558 --> 06:32.090
- Ooh.

06:32.091 --> 06:32.623
No. Just kidding.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.293
#DragFamilyValues

06:34.294 --> 06:35.961
No. Just kidding.

06:35.963 --> 06:36.528
(all laugh)

06:36.529 --> 06:37.094
No. Just kidding.

06:37.097 --> 06:38.297
Gentlemen,
start your engines,

06:38.298 --> 06:39.498
No. Just kidding.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.733
and may the best woman win.

06:40.734 --> 06:41.967
No. Just kidding.

06:41.969 --> 06:43.519
(applause)

06:43.520 --> 06:45.070
No. Just kidding.

06:46.874 --> 06:49.341
- Oh, we got shoes
and fabric.

06:49.343 --> 06:50.259
- How does it feel
to be in Hollywood?

06:50.260 --> 06:51.176
- Oh, we got shoes
and fabric.

06:51.178 --> 06:52.177
- Oh, my God,
I feel like a star.

06:52.178 --> 06:53.177
- Oh, we got shoes
and fabric.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.279
- This is it.
This is it.

06:54.280 --> 06:55.379
- Oh, we got shoes
and fabric.

06:55.382 --> 06:57.583
It's so different this time
like from Season 7 though,

06:57.584 --> 06:59.785
- Oh, we got shoes
and fabric.

06:59.787 --> 07:00.669
because it's like
a lot more joyful

07:00.670 --> 07:01.552
- Oh, we got shoes
and fabric.

07:01.555 --> 07:02.938
and less riddled
with anxiety,

07:02.939 --> 07:04.322
- Oh, we got shoes
and fabric.

07:04.324 --> 07:04.840
which is a new thing.

07:04.841 --> 07:05.357
- Oh, we got shoes
and fabric.

07:05.359 --> 07:05.858
- That's awesome.
- Yeah.

07:05.859 --> 07:06.358
- Oh, we got shoes
and fabric.

07:06.360 --> 07:08.327
It's so cool to have
my mom in the room now

07:08.328 --> 07:10.295
- Oh, we got shoes
and fabric.

07:10.297 --> 07:10.996
when I'm not
a nervous wreck.

07:10.997 --> 07:11.696
- Oh, we got shoes
and fabric.

07:11.698 --> 07:13.882
What I'm thinking
is sexy Russian trophy bride

07:13.883 --> 07:16.067
- Oh, we got shoes
and fabric.

07:16.069 --> 07:16.935
with her peasant mom.

07:16.936 --> 07:17.802
- Oh, we got shoes
and fabric.

07:17.805 --> 07:18.504
- And who am I?

07:18.505 --> 07:19.204
- Oh, we got shoes
and fabric.

07:19.206 --> 07:20.589
(both laugh)

07:20.590 --> 07:21.973
- Oh, we got shoes
and fabric.

07:21.975 --> 07:22.958
- This is definitely
going to be a transformation.

07:22.959 --> 07:23.942
- Oh, we got shoes
and fabric.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.644
I don't think my mother
has ever worn heels in her life.

07:25.645 --> 07:27.345
- Oh, we got shoes
and fabric.

07:27.347 --> 07:28.864
She's used to spending
under $10

07:28.865 --> 07:30.382
- Oh, we got shoes
and fabric.

07:30.384 --> 07:31.100
for a blouse at Savers.

07:31.101 --> 07:31.817
- Oh, we got shoes
and fabric.

07:31.819 --> 07:32.851
I probably
shouldn't say that.

07:32.852 --> 07:33.884
- Oh, we got shoes
and fabric.

07:33.887 --> 07:34.586
Oh, my God.

07:34.587 --> 07:35.286
- Oh, we got shoes
and fabric.

07:35.289 --> 07:36.455
It fits you
like a fucking glove.

07:36.456 --> 07:37.622
- Oh, we got shoes
and fabric.

07:37.624 --> 07:38.106
That's incredible.

07:38.107 --> 07:38.589
- Oh, we got shoes
and fabric.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.008
- I'm very close
to my sister Tabi.

07:40.009 --> 07:41.425
- Oh, we got shoes
and fabric.

07:41.428 --> 07:42.427
I'm so happy
to see her here.

07:42.428 --> 07:43.427
- Oh, we got shoes
and fabric.

07:43.430 --> 07:44.096
When's the last time
we've seen each other?

07:44.097 --> 07:44.763
- Oh, we got shoes
and fabric.

07:44.765 --> 07:45.964
Oh, mom's funeral.
- Yeah, a year ago.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.164
- Oh, we got shoes
and fabric.

07:47.167 --> 07:47.933
You know, tomorrow
makes a year.

07:47.934 --> 07:48.700
- Oh, we got shoes
and fabric.

07:48.702 --> 07:49.668
Yeah. But at the same time,

07:49.669 --> 07:50.635
- Oh, we got shoes
and fabric.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.187
there are
so many mixed emotions.

07:52.188 --> 07:53.738
- Oh, we got shoes
and fabric.

07:53.740 --> 07:54.823
Mom would have loved
to do this.

07:54.824 --> 07:55.907
- Oh, we got shoes
and fabric.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.492
She would have.
- Yeah.

07:57.493 --> 07:59.076
- Oh, we got shoes
and fabric.

07:59.079 --> 08:00.896
- (cries)

08:00.897 --> 08:02.714
- Oh, we got shoes
and fabric.

08:06.220 --> 08:07.853
- I'm glad we're together,

08:07.855 --> 08:09.455
'cause it's a sensitive time
for us.

08:09.456 --> 08:11.056
- I'm glad we're together,

08:11.058 --> 08:11.673
- (sobbing)
Thank you for coming.

08:11.674 --> 08:12.289
- I'm glad we're together,

08:12.292 --> 08:14.092
The day that they closed
my mother's casket,

08:14.093 --> 08:15.893
- I'm glad we're together,

08:15.896 --> 08:17.246
I just shut down.

08:17.247 --> 08:18.597
- I'm glad we're together,

08:19.766 --> 08:21.433
I just threw myself
in my work.

08:21.435 --> 08:22.784
I felt that
if I didn't see my family

08:22.785 --> 08:24.134
I just threw myself
in my work.

08:24.137 --> 08:24.536
or I shut them out,

08:24.537 --> 08:24.936
I just threw myself
in my work.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.505
I didn't have to face
the passing of my mother.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.073
I just threw myself
in my work.

08:28.075 --> 08:28.924
So now seeing Tabatha,

08:28.925 --> 08:29.774
I just threw myself
in my work.

08:29.776 --> 08:30.642
Oh, I'm facing it.

08:30.643 --> 08:31.509
I just threw myself
in my work.

08:31.512 --> 08:32.661
- It's just a piece of me

08:32.662 --> 08:33.811
I just threw myself
in my work.

08:33.814 --> 08:35.347
will never be...
I'll never be complete.

08:35.348 --> 08:36.881
I just threw myself
in my work.

08:36.884 --> 08:38.333
- I felt like
there was so much on me.

08:38.334 --> 08:39.783
I just threw myself
in my work.

08:39.786 --> 08:40.869
That's why
I just said I have to...

08:40.870 --> 08:41.953
I just threw myself
in my work.

08:41.955 --> 08:43.138
I have to focus on work,
keep myself moving.

08:43.139 --> 08:44.322
I just threw myself
in my work.

08:44.324 --> 08:44.773
- Keep yourself busy.

08:44.774 --> 08:45.223
I just threw myself
in my work.

08:45.225 --> 08:46.208
- That's why I've been
traveling so much.

08:46.209 --> 08:47.192
I just threw myself
in my work.

08:47.194 --> 08:47.626
- Yeah.

08:47.627 --> 08:48.059
I just threw myself
in my work.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.277
- I needed time.

08:49.278 --> 08:50.494
I just threw myself
in my work.

08:50.497 --> 08:51.396
It was too much for me.

08:51.397 --> 08:52.296
I just threw myself
in my work.

08:52.299 --> 08:52.981
It was too much.

08:52.982 --> 08:53.664
I just threw myself
in my work.

08:53.667 --> 08:54.633
I'm feeling guilty because

08:54.634 --> 08:55.600
I just threw myself
in my work.

08:55.602 --> 08:56.735
I just don't think that
I've been a good big brother

08:56.736 --> 08:57.869
I just threw myself
in my work.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.337
because I should have been there
more for my family.

08:59.338 --> 09:00.804
I just threw myself
in my work.

09:00.807 --> 09:01.439
It's just kind of something

09:01.440 --> 09:02.072
I just threw myself
in my work.

09:02.075 --> 09:02.924
that I'm holding heavy
on my heart.

09:02.925 --> 09:03.774
I just threw myself
in my work.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.927
As much as I want to be
in this challenge to win,

09:05.928 --> 09:08.078
I just threw myself
in my work.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.848
it's just hard
to get my head in the game.

09:09.849 --> 09:11.616
I just threw myself
in my work.

09:11.618 --> 09:13.385
It's like I'm at capacity.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.153
I just threw myself
in my work.

09:16.223 --> 09:19.157
- Coming up...
You're the only queen left

09:19.159 --> 09:19.991
who is not from Season 5.

09:19.992 --> 09:20.824
- Coming up...
You're the only queen left

09:20.827 --> 09:22.127
- I noticed that.
If I end up in the bottom,

09:22.128 --> 09:23.428
- Coming up...
You're the only queen left

09:23.430 --> 09:24.529
it could be
"RuPaul's Best Friend Race,"

09:24.530 --> 09:25.629
- Coming up...
You're the only queen left

09:25.632 --> 09:26.598
which means I go home.

09:26.599 --> 09:27.565
- Coming up...
You're the only queen left

09:28.468 --> 09:30.802
(laughs)

09:30.804 --> 09:31.970
(RuPaul laughs)

09:31.971 --> 09:33.137
(laughs)

09:33.941 --> 09:36.541
(RuPaul laughs)

09:36.543 --> 09:38.276
- I'm going to wear that?
- No. No, no, no, no, me.

09:38.277 --> 09:40.010
(RuPaul laughs)

09:40.013 --> 09:40.512
For this week's challenge,

09:40.513 --> 09:41.012
(RuPaul laughs)

09:41.014 --> 09:42.230
we are going to be making over
our loved ones,

09:42.231 --> 09:43.447
(RuPaul laughs)

09:43.450 --> 09:45.000
getting them in full drag.

09:45.001 --> 09:46.551
(RuPaul laughs)

09:46.553 --> 09:47.102
- Hi. I'm Katya.

09:47.103 --> 09:47.652
(RuPaul laughs)

09:47.654 --> 09:48.353
Nice to meet you.

09:48.354 --> 09:49.053
(RuPaul laughs)

09:49.056 --> 09:49.855
So how come
you call her mom?

09:49.856 --> 09:50.655
(RuPaul laughs)

09:50.657 --> 09:51.523
- She's legally
my grandmother,

09:51.524 --> 09:52.390
(RuPaul laughs)

09:52.392 --> 09:54.109
but she's taken care of me
since I was three years old.

09:54.110 --> 09:55.827
(RuPaul laughs)

09:55.829 --> 09:56.178
- No way.

09:56.179 --> 09:56.528
(RuPaul laughs)

09:56.530 --> 09:57.262
- She's the only mom
I've ever known.

09:57.263 --> 09:57.995
(RuPaul laughs)

09:57.998 --> 09:58.397
So that's my mommy.

09:58.398 --> 09:58.797
(RuPaul laughs)

09:58.799 --> 09:59.982
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Raised him.

09:59.983 --> 10:01.166
(RuPaul laughs)

10:01.168 --> 10:02.084
He turned out
to be wonderful.

10:02.085 --> 10:03.001
(RuPaul laughs)

10:03.003 --> 10:03.986
He finished high school.

10:03.987 --> 10:04.970
(RuPaul laughs)

10:04.972 --> 10:05.504
(all laugh)

10:05.505 --> 10:06.037
(RuPaul laughs)

10:06.039 --> 10:07.339
- High expectations.

10:07.340 --> 10:08.640
(RuPaul laughs)

10:08.642 --> 10:10.742
Having my mom here
is just beyond words.

10:10.743 --> 10:12.843
(RuPaul laughs)

10:12.846 --> 10:14.679
She made her own T-shirt
for the occasion.

10:14.680 --> 10:16.513
(RuPaul laughs)

10:16.516 --> 10:16.948
Like it's good times.

10:16.949 --> 10:17.381
(RuPaul laughs)

10:17.384 --> 10:18.583
So I'll make us
matching outfits.

10:18.584 --> 10:19.783
(RuPaul laughs)

10:19.786 --> 10:20.602
I'm gonna make
some quick dresses.

10:20.603 --> 10:21.419
(RuPaul laughs)

10:21.421 --> 10:22.254
Good thing I'm good at it.

10:22.255 --> 10:23.088
(RuPaul laughs)

10:23.090 --> 10:23.405
- I know.

10:23.406 --> 10:23.721
(RuPaul laughs)

10:23.724 --> 10:24.857
- This challenge couldn't
have come at a better time.

10:24.858 --> 10:25.991
(RuPaul laughs)

10:25.993 --> 10:27.142
I won the makeover challenge
Season 5,

10:27.143 --> 10:28.292
(RuPaul laughs)

10:28.295 --> 10:29.277
so this is something
I'm very strong at.

10:29.278 --> 10:30.260
(RuPaul laughs)

10:30.263 --> 10:31.680
I think this is gonna
pull me off a win.

10:31.681 --> 10:33.098
(RuPaul laughs)

10:33.100 --> 10:33.949
- This is amazing
that you're here.

10:33.950 --> 10:34.799
(RuPaul laughs)

10:34.801 --> 10:35.817
- Hell or high water,
I was gonna be here.

10:35.818 --> 10:36.834
(RuPaul laughs)

10:36.837 --> 10:37.970
- When I first
started doing drag,

10:37.971 --> 10:39.104
(RuPaul laughs)

10:39.106 --> 10:40.105
my mom was afraid
that I was like

10:40.106 --> 10:41.105
(RuPaul laughs)

10:41.108 --> 10:42.374
a cross-dressing prostitute
doing drugs

10:42.375 --> 10:43.641
(RuPaul laughs)

10:43.644 --> 10:44.693
and getting into trouble.

10:44.694 --> 10:45.743
(RuPaul laughs)

10:45.746 --> 10:47.412
Which I was, but...
(laughs)

10:47.413 --> 10:49.079
(RuPaul laughs)

10:49.082 --> 10:50.782
- You're probably a lot more
clearheaded this time

10:50.783 --> 10:52.483
(RuPaul laughs)

10:52.486 --> 10:53.352
than you were on Season 5.

10:53.353 --> 10:54.219
(RuPaul laughs)

10:54.221 --> 10:55.621
Now that you're clean,
you're probably clearheaded.

10:55.622 --> 10:57.022
(RuPaul laughs)

10:57.024 --> 10:58.440
- I am. I really am.
- And doing so well.

10:58.441 --> 10:59.857
(RuPaul laughs)

11:00.560 --> 11:03.762
That makes me happy
more than anything.

11:04.431 --> 11:06.164
It really does.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.416
- Right after Season 5,

11:07.417 --> 11:08.667
It really does.

11:08.669 --> 11:10.068
it was really easy
to say yes

11:10.069 --> 11:11.468
It really does.

11:11.471 --> 11:12.721
when I was offered,
you know,

11:12.722 --> 11:13.972
It really does.

11:13.974 --> 11:14.773
all the things
you get offered

11:14.774 --> 11:15.573
It really does.

11:15.575 --> 11:17.509
when you're being treated
like a rock star on the road.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.444
It really does.

11:19.446 --> 11:20.629
I've won
four challenges, mom.

11:20.630 --> 11:21.813
It really does.

11:21.815 --> 11:22.681
- (gasps) Oh, Justin.

11:22.682 --> 11:23.548
It really does.

11:23.550 --> 11:24.866
Oh, my God, that's so great.

11:24.867 --> 11:26.183
It really does.

11:26.186 --> 11:27.569
I'm so happy for you.

11:27.570 --> 11:28.953
It really does.

11:28.955 --> 11:29.988
Not that that matters.

11:29.989 --> 11:31.022
It really does.

11:31.024 --> 11:31.990
(both laugh)

11:31.991 --> 11:32.957
It really does.

11:32.959 --> 11:34.459
- I'm glad that
I was able to stop

11:34.460 --> 11:35.960
It really does.

11:35.962 --> 11:37.429
and reassess in time.

11:37.430 --> 11:38.897
It really does.

11:38.899 --> 11:42.000
Now I focus on the work
rather than the after party.

11:42.001 --> 11:45.102
It really does.

11:46.873 --> 11:49.441
- Hello, hello, hello.

11:49.443 --> 11:50.275
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:50.276 --> 11:51.108
- Hello, hello, hello.

11:51.111 --> 11:52.194
- Hey, Katya. Hi, Pat.
- Hi.

11:52.195 --> 11:53.278
- Hello, hello, hello.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.813
- That lace front looks like
it's coming out of your head.

11:54.814 --> 11:56.347
- Hello, hello, hello.

11:56.349 --> 11:57.565
- (laughs) It isn't?

11:57.566 --> 11:58.782
- Hello, hello, hello.

11:58.785 --> 11:59.284
(all laugh)

11:59.285 --> 11:59.784
- Hello, hello, hello.

11:59.786 --> 12:01.686
- Now, did you watch
your child on "Drag Race?"

12:01.687 --> 12:03.587
- Hello, hello, hello.

12:03.590 --> 12:03.939
- Yes, I did.

12:03.940 --> 12:04.289
- Hello, hello, hello.

12:04.291 --> 12:05.290
- What was the most shocking
thing you learned?

12:05.291 --> 12:06.290
- Hello, hello, hello.

12:06.293 --> 12:07.259
- When he got
really personal

12:07.260 --> 12:08.226
- Hello, hello, hello.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.311
about his struggle
with anxiety,

12:09.312 --> 12:10.395
- Hello, hello, hello.

12:10.397 --> 12:11.963
hearing that heartache,
I mean, I knew it,

12:11.964 --> 12:13.530
- Hello, hello, hello.

12:13.533 --> 12:14.899
but to see it so raw

12:14.900 --> 12:16.266
- Hello, hello, hello.

12:16.269 --> 12:17.135
that was shocking my heart.

12:17.136 --> 12:18.002
- Hello, hello, hello.

12:18.004 --> 12:19.020
And thank you
for counseling him.

12:19.021 --> 12:20.037
- Hello, hello, hello.

12:20.040 --> 12:20.572
You did wonderful.

12:20.573 --> 12:21.105
- Hello, hello, hello.

12:21.108 --> 12:21.790
- Oh, that's very kind.

12:21.791 --> 12:22.473
- Hello, hello, hello.

12:22.476 --> 12:22.991
Thank you.

12:22.992 --> 12:23.507
- Hello, hello, hello.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.193
Now, Katya,
you're the only queen left

12:25.194 --> 12:26.877
- Hello, hello, hello.

12:26.880 --> 12:27.929
who is not from Season 5.

12:27.930 --> 12:28.979
- Hello, hello, hello.

12:28.982 --> 12:29.698
- I noticed that. Yeah.

12:29.699 --> 12:30.415
- Hello, hello, hello.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.600
- Do you think that
the Rolaskatox girls

12:31.601 --> 12:32.784
- Hello, hello, hello.

12:32.786 --> 12:33.969
are, you know--
- Conspiring against me?

12:33.970 --> 12:35.153
- Hello, hello, hello.

12:35.155 --> 12:36.371
Picking off the other seasons
one by one?

12:36.372 --> 12:37.588
- Hello, hello, hello.

12:37.591 --> 12:38.890
I'm the only one in the group
who's not from Season 5,

12:38.891 --> 12:40.190
- Hello, hello, hello.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.776
which means that they all have
stronger bonds with each other

12:41.777 --> 12:43.360
- Hello, hello, hello.

12:43.363 --> 12:44.429
than they do with me,
especially Rolaskatox.

12:44.430 --> 12:45.496
- Hello, hello, hello.

12:45.499 --> 12:46.782
So if I end up
in the bottom,

12:46.783 --> 12:48.066
- Hello, hello, hello.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.801
it could be
"RuPaul's Best Friend Race,"

12:49.802 --> 12:51.535
- Hello, hello, hello.

12:51.538 --> 12:52.637
which means I go home.

12:52.638 --> 12:53.737
- Hello, hello, hello.

12:53.740 --> 12:54.906
(laughs)

12:54.907 --> 12:56.073
- Hello, hello, hello.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.008
- Hi, Heather.
- Hi, Ru.

12:57.009 --> 12:57.941
- Hello, hello, hello.

12:57.944 --> 12:58.710
- Hi, Detox.
- Hi, Ru.

12:58.711 --> 12:59.477
- Hello, hello, hello.

12:59.479 --> 12:59.961
- You're a lawyer.
- I am.

12:59.962 --> 13:00.444
- Hello, hello, hello.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.713
- Are you the reason Detox
is out of prison today?

13:01.714 --> 13:02.980
- Hello, hello, hello.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.833
- I can't take credit for that,
but I'm the reason

13:04.834 --> 13:06.684
- Hello, hello, hello.

13:06.686 --> 13:08.953
that if you steal his name
and likeness, you'll get sued.

13:08.954 --> 13:11.221
- Hello, hello, hello.

13:11.224 --> 13:11.556
(all laugh)

13:11.557 --> 13:11.889
- Hello, hello, hello.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.008
- Now, Detox, you lived
with Heather at one point.

13:13.009 --> 13:14.125
- Hello, hello, hello.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.043
- Mm-hmm. I was in a bad place
when I was a kid.

13:15.044 --> 13:15.960
- Hello, hello, hello.

13:15.962 --> 13:17.362
I was misunderstood,
and she kind of encouraged me

13:17.363 --> 13:18.763
- Hello, hello, hello.

13:18.765 --> 13:20.615
to come out and live my life
as who I am,

13:20.616 --> 13:22.466
- Hello, hello, hello.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.451
help me blossom
as a young artist

13:23.452 --> 13:24.434
- Hello, hello, hello.

13:24.437 --> 13:25.136
and a freak and a weirdo.

13:25.137 --> 13:25.836
- Hello, hello, hello.

13:25.839 --> 13:27.405
- Were you just
a naturally nurturing person,

13:27.406 --> 13:28.972
- Hello, hello, hello.

13:28.975 --> 13:29.374
or did you just see

13:29.375 --> 13:29.774
- Hello, hello, hello.

13:29.776 --> 13:31.076
my kid brother
is in a lot of trouble.

13:31.077 --> 13:32.377
- Hello, hello, hello.

13:32.379 --> 13:32.878
I've got to step up?

13:32.879 --> 13:33.378
- Hello, hello, hello.

13:33.380 --> 13:33.862
- Basically.
- (laughs)

13:33.863 --> 13:34.345
- Hello, hello, hello.

13:34.347 --> 13:35.730
- Now, is there going to be
a strong family resemblance?

13:35.731 --> 13:37.114
- Hello, hello, hello.

13:37.117 --> 13:38.366
- People tell us all the time
we have the same nose.

13:38.367 --> 13:39.616
- Hello, hello, hello.

13:39.619 --> 13:40.535
Obviously, sadly.

13:40.536 --> 13:41.452
- Hello, hello, hello.

13:41.454 --> 13:42.153
(all laugh)

13:42.154 --> 13:42.853
- Hello, hello, hello.

13:42.856 --> 13:43.338
- It's a gorgeous nose.

13:43.339 --> 13:43.821
- Hello, hello, hello.

13:43.824 --> 13:44.840
- I love our nose,
especially now.

13:44.841 --> 13:45.857
- Hello, hello, hello.

13:45.859 --> 13:46.308
But before, we were like,

13:46.309 --> 13:46.758
- Hello, hello, hello.

13:46.760 --> 13:47.476
we gotta get
brother/sister nose jobs.

13:47.477 --> 13:48.193
- Hello, hello, hello.

13:48.195 --> 13:49.161
- Yeah. I'm still
not opposed to that.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.128
- Hello, hello, hello.

13:50.130 --> 13:50.595
(all laugh)

13:50.596 --> 13:51.061
- Hello, hello, hello.

13:51.064 --> 13:51.863
- The key
to winning this challenge

13:51.864 --> 13:52.663
- Hello, hello, hello.

13:52.666 --> 13:53.799
is by creating
a family resemblance,

13:53.800 --> 13:54.933
- Hello, hello, hello.

13:54.935 --> 13:56.334
and it's like we're
the same fucking person.

13:56.335 --> 13:57.734
- Hello, hello, hello.

13:57.737 --> 13:58.470
She's just got
a real vagina.

13:58.471 --> 13:59.204
- Hello, hello, hello.

13:59.206 --> 13:59.788
But I need to focus

13:59.789 --> 14:00.371
- Hello, hello, hello.

14:00.373 --> 14:01.005
because I haven't had
a win in a while.

14:01.006 --> 14:01.638
- Hello, hello, hello.

14:01.641 --> 14:03.091
And even though
I've been on the top,

14:03.092 --> 14:04.542
- Hello, hello, hello.

14:04.544 --> 14:04.993
I want to win.

14:04.994 --> 14:05.443
- Hello, hello, hello.

14:05.445 --> 14:06.294
- Hey, Roxxxy.
- Hi, Ru.

14:06.295 --> 14:07.144
- Hello, hello, hello.

14:07.147 --> 14:07.963
- Hi, Sonia.
- Hi, Ru.

14:07.964 --> 14:08.780
- Hello, hello, hello.

14:08.782 --> 14:09.598
- I can't believe
I'm meeting the woman

14:09.599 --> 14:10.415
- Hello, hello, hello.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.217
who singlehandedly
raised this gorgeous child.

14:12.218 --> 14:14.018
- Hello, hello, hello.

14:14.020 --> 14:14.652
- Can you believe that?

14:14.653 --> 14:15.285
- Hello, hello, hello.

14:15.288 --> 14:15.854
- It's just amazing.

14:15.855 --> 14:16.421
- Hello, hello, hello.

14:16.423 --> 14:18.256
Did you watch your child
on "Drag Race?"

14:18.257 --> 14:20.090
- Hello, hello, hello.

14:20.093 --> 14:20.425
- Oh, yeah.

14:20.426 --> 14:20.758
- Hello, hello, hello.

14:20.760 --> 14:21.593
- Because the world
got to hear

14:21.594 --> 14:22.427
- Hello, hello, hello.

14:22.429 --> 14:23.178
this incredible story

14:23.179 --> 14:23.928
- Hello, hello, hello.

14:23.930 --> 14:25.463
of how you really came
to this kid's rescue.

14:25.464 --> 14:26.997
- Hello, hello, hello.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.650
- My mother left my sister
and myself at a bus stop

14:28.651 --> 14:30.301
- Hello, hello, hello.

14:30.303 --> 14:30.685
when I was three,

14:30.686 --> 14:31.068
- Hello, hello, hello.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.304
and I remember it
like it was yesterday.

14:32.305 --> 14:33.538
- Hello, hello, hello.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.273
And like I come off
as this strong character,

14:35.274 --> 14:37.007
- Hello, hello, hello.

14:37.010 --> 14:37.642
I try to stay so strong,

14:37.643 --> 14:38.275
- Hello, hello, hello.

14:38.278 --> 14:40.262
but I'm so weak
at the same time. (cries)

14:40.263 --> 14:42.247
- Hello, hello, hello.

14:42.249 --> 14:43.949
- We were all heartbroken...

14:43.950 --> 14:45.650
- Hello, hello, hello.

14:45.652 --> 14:46.084
- I know, I know.

14:46.085 --> 14:46.517
- Hello, hello, hello.

14:46.519 --> 14:46.968
- When we heard the story.

14:46.969 --> 14:47.418
- Hello, hello, hello.

14:47.420 --> 14:48.136
- Maybe he needed
to do that.

14:48.137 --> 14:48.853
- Hello, hello, hello.

14:48.855 --> 14:49.320
Sometimes you need to...

14:49.321 --> 14:49.786
- Hello, hello, hello.

14:49.789 --> 14:50.605
- You have to get it out
of your system, you know.

14:50.606 --> 14:51.422
- Hello, hello, hello.

14:51.424 --> 14:52.740
- Mm-hmm.
- And we took that story

14:52.741 --> 14:54.057
- Hello, hello, hello.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.076
and we put it in our hearts.

14:55.077 --> 14:56.093
- Hello, hello, hello.

14:56.096 --> 14:56.761
And now
you're on "Drag Race."

14:56.762 --> 14:57.427
- Hello, hello, hello.

14:57.430 --> 14:58.546
- This is unbelievable.

14:58.547 --> 14:59.663
- Hello, hello, hello.

14:59.666 --> 15:01.149
- Are you planning
to just tear it up?

15:01.150 --> 15:02.633
- Hello, hello, hello.

15:02.636 --> 15:03.535
- Whoa, am I.

15:03.536 --> 15:04.435
- Hello, hello, hello.

15:04.437 --> 15:05.103
(both laugh)

I got that from her.

15:39.605 --> 15:40.371
- Hello, hello, hello.

15:40.373 --> 15:41.456
She felt like everything
I touched was gold.

- Hello, hello, hello.

15:42.542 --> 15:43.358

encouraging me.

that believed in me.

15:44.810 --> 15:45.442
- Hello, hello, hello.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.828
She protected me
from the cruelty of the world.

15:46.829 --> 15:48.212
- Hello, hello, hello.

15:48.214 --> 15:49.764

16:14.975 --> 16:16.174
face it a little.

16:16.175 --> 16:17.374

16:17.377 --> 16:18.376
And it was the right time.

19:54.643 --> 19:55.258
And I'm like, okay, just be

19:55.261 --> 19:57.328
I didn't come here to half step

19:57.329 --> 19:59.396
And I'm like, okay, just be
strong, be strong, be strong.

20:00.533 --> 20:01.666
And I'm like, okay, just be

20:01.668 --> 20:03.318
You're going to get really
stunning really fast.

20:03.319 --> 20:04.969
And I'm like, okay, just be
strong, be strong, be strong.

20:04.971 --> 20:06.487
- Alaska, what were you like
as a kid?

20:06.488 --> 20:08.004
And I'm like, okay, just be
strong, be strong, be strong.

20:08.007 --> 20:09.857
- He was a really good kid,
as a baby even.

20:09.858 --> 20:11.708
And I'm like, okay, just be
strong, be strong, be strong.

20:11.711 --> 20:12.310
Hardly ever cried.

20:12.311 --> 20:12.910
And I'm like, okay, just be
strong, be strong, be strong.

20:12.912 --> 20:13.778

20:13.779 --> 20:14.645
And I'm like, okay, just be

20:14.647 --> 20:16.514
You made up for it later on.
(laughs)

20:16.515 --> 20:18.382
And I'm like, okay, just be
strong, be strong, be strong.

20:18.384 --> 20:19.634
- I was a fuckin monster.

20:19.635 --> 20:20.885
And I'm like, okay, just be
strong, be strong, be strong.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.637
I still cry
when I don't get my way.

20:22.638 --> 20:24.388
And I'm like, okay, just be
strong, be strong, be strong.

20:26.459 --> 20:31.495
- Last week, on the anniversary
of dad's passing, I was here.

20:31.497 --> 20:32.463
- I was thinking
about you a lot,

20:32.464 --> 20:33.430
- Last week, on the anniversary
of dad's passing, I was here.

20:33.433 --> 20:34.516
wondering
how it was going and...

20:34.517 --> 20:35.600
- Last week, on the anniversary
of dad's passing, I was here.

20:38.204 --> 20:40.805
- It's been tough.

20:40.807 --> 20:41.506
Not everyone knows this,

20:41.507 --> 20:42.206
- It's been tough.

20:42.208 --> 20:43.224
but my head wasn't really
in the game Season 5

20:43.225 --> 20:44.241
- It's been tough.

20:44.244 --> 20:45.460
because before I came
into the competition,

20:45.461 --> 20:46.677
- It's been tough.

20:46.679 --> 20:47.395
my father got really sick,

20:47.396 --> 20:48.112
- It's been tough.

20:48.114 --> 20:50.098
and at the time, we didn't
have the best relationship.

20:50.099 --> 20:52.083
- It's been tough.

20:52.085 --> 20:53.701
I had a tough time with dad
being accepting.

20:53.702 --> 20:55.318
- It's been tough.

20:55.321 --> 20:55.903
So right before he passed...

20:55.904 --> 20:56.486
- It's been tough.

20:56.489 --> 20:57.705
- I think he accepted you
before that.

20:57.706 --> 20:58.922
- It's been tough.

20:58.925 --> 21:01.776
I mean, he was not very easy
to share his feelings.

21:01.777 --> 21:04.628
- It's been tough.

21:04.631 --> 21:06.948
- Watching me on the show
and him being so close to death,

21:06.949 --> 21:09.266
- It's been tough.

21:09.269 --> 21:10.301
it opened the door
for a lot of conversations

21:10.302 --> 21:11.334
- It's been tough.

21:11.337 --> 21:12.170
that we never really had,

21:12.171 --> 21:13.004
- It's been tough.

21:13.006 --> 21:14.072
and I'll be forever grateful
for that.

21:14.073 --> 21:15.139
- It's been tough.

21:15.141 --> 21:15.740
Well, I mean, I could tell,

21:15.741 --> 21:16.340
- It's been tough.

21:16.342 --> 21:18.109
like he was like making
amends before he left.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.877
- It's been tough.

21:20.213 --> 21:23.814
I was in Orlando working
at Pulse and he showed up.

21:23.816 --> 21:24.332
And I remember,
like, bawling

21:24.333 --> 21:24.849
I was in Orlando working
at Pulse and he showed up.

21:24.851 --> 21:26.451
'cause my fucking daddy
was at my drag show.

21:26.452 --> 21:28.052
I was in Orlando working
at Pulse and he showed up.

21:28.054 --> 21:29.637
You were there.
- Mm-hmm.

21:29.638 --> 21:31.221
I was in Orlando working
at Pulse and he showed up.

21:32.492 --> 21:35.993
- Well, at least he'll see that
we're together and having fun.

21:35.995 --> 21:36.627
I think
that's all that matters.

21:36.628 --> 21:37.260
- Well, at least he'll see that
we're together and having fun.

21:37.263 --> 21:38.813
The fact that I can
share this with my sister

21:38.814 --> 21:40.364
- Well, at least he'll see that
we're together and having fun.

21:40.366 --> 21:42.116
and feel him here today
is like--

21:42.117 --> 21:43.867
- Well, at least he'll see that
we're together and having fun.

21:43.870 --> 21:44.769
it's like come full circle.

21:44.770 --> 21:45.669
- Well, at least he'll see that
we're together and having fun.

21:45.672 --> 21:46.688
It feels right to me.

21:46.689 --> 21:47.705
- Well, at least he'll see that
we're together and having fun.

21:48.474 --> 21:51.309
- Girl, you are beating
the hell out of me.

21:51.311 --> 21:51.709
- This is a beat.

21:51.710 --> 21:52.108
- Girl, you are beating
the hell out of me.

21:52.111 --> 21:52.910
- We're all showgirls
tonight.

21:52.911 --> 21:53.710
- Girl, you are beating
the hell out of me.

21:53.713 --> 21:54.195
- Oh.

21:54.196 --> 21:54.678
- Girl, you are beating
the hell out of me.

21:54.681 --> 21:55.079
- I feel like Katya.

21:55.080 --> 21:55.478
- Girl, you are beating
the hell out of me.

21:55.481 --> 21:56.714
I laughed in the mirror,
and I went, oh.

21:56.715 --> 21:57.948
- Girl, you are beating
the hell out of me.

21:59.319 --> 22:00.718
(all laugh)

22:00.720 --> 22:01.619
- Oh, those glasses,

22:12.548 --> 22:13.531

22:13.533 --> 22:14.632

26:18.844 --> 26:20.094
- My mom and I,
we look sexy as can be.

26:20.095 --> 26:21.345
- What they're wearing, would
you call that Russian dressing?

26:21.347 --> 26:21.929
We look like
the house of Andrews,

26:21.930 --> 26:22.512
- What they're wearing, would
you call that Russian dressing?

26:22.515 --> 26:24.632
and we are getting
our complete lags, honey.

26:24.633 --> 26:26.750
- What they're wearing, would
you call that Russian dressing?

26:26.752 --> 26:27.651
- Panthers on the runway.

26:27.652 --> 26:28.551
- What they're wearing, would
you call that Russian dressing?

26:28.554 --> 26:29.754
Give 'em hell, Raquel.

26:29.755 --> 26:30.955
- What they're wearing, would
you call that Russian dressing?

26:32.992 --> 26:34.792
- Coming up...
- This is "Allstars."

26:34.794 --> 26:35.760
I think this was
a big lazy tonight,

26:35.761 --> 26:36.727
- Coming up...
- This is "Allstars."

26:36.729 --> 26:37.778
and I expect more.

26:37.779 --> 26:38.828
- Coming up...
- This is "Allstars."

26:41.100 --> 26:43.534
(RuPaul laughs)

26:44.303 --> 26:46.937
(RuPaul laughs)

26:46.939 --> 26:47.671
- Welcome, ladies.

26:47.672 --> 26:48.404
(RuPaul laughs)

26:48.407 --> 26:49.857
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.

26:49.858 --> 26:51.308
(RuPaul laughs)

26:51.310 --> 26:53.744
First up,
Alyssa and Ava Edwards.

26:53.745 --> 26:56.179
(RuPaul laughs)

26:56.182 --> 26:57.098
- I loved the vogue so much.

26:57.099 --> 26:58.015
(RuPaul laughs)

26:58.017 --> 26:58.966
I felt like
it was like a weird,

26:58.967 --> 26:59.916
(RuPaul laughs)

26:59.919 --> 27:01.235
like, birds of death
nightmare

27:01.236 --> 27:02.552
(RuPaul laughs)

27:02.555 --> 27:03.554
that I never wanted to end.

27:03.555 --> 27:04.554
(RuPaul laughs)

27:04.557 --> 27:06.140
- I did think you had too much
going on in that ensemble,

27:06.141 --> 27:07.724
(RuPaul laughs)

27:07.727 --> 27:08.609
Alyssa, even for you.

27:08.610 --> 27:09.492
(RuPaul laughs)

27:09.495 --> 27:10.111
But this runway tonight

27:10.112 --> 27:10.728
(RuPaul laughs)

27:10.730 --> 27:12.046
is everything that I love
about Alyssa Edwards.

27:12.047 --> 27:13.363
(RuPaul laughs)

27:13.366 --> 27:15.249
- I have to agree,
and you look so fantastic.

27:15.250 --> 27:17.133
(RuPaul laughs)

27:17.136 --> 27:17.468
- Thank you.

27:17.469 --> 27:17.801
(RuPaul laughs)

27:17.803 --> 27:18.569
- I think you nailed
the challenge perfectly

27:18.570 --> 27:19.336
(RuPaul laughs)

27:19.338 --> 27:20.221
because
you look like sisters.

27:20.222 --> 27:21.105
(RuPaul laughs)

27:21.107 --> 27:21.739
- Thank you so much.

27:21.740 --> 27:22.372
(RuPaul laughs)

27:22.375 --> 27:24.642
- Up next,
Alaska and Hawaii.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.910
(RuPaul laughs)

27:26.912 --> 27:28.145
Aloha.
- Aloha.

27:28.146 --> 27:29.379
(RuPaul laughs)

27:29.382 --> 27:30.214
- I thought that the performance
was really fun.

27:30.215 --> 27:31.047
(RuPaul laughs)

27:31.050 --> 27:32.416
- But what's having
a disconnect for me, Alaska,

27:32.417 --> 27:33.783
(RuPaul laughs)

27:33.786 --> 27:34.368
was that you let your mom

27:34.369 --> 27:34.951
(RuPaul laughs)

27:34.954 --> 27:36.170
come out on the main stage
in flip flops,

27:36.171 --> 27:37.387
(RuPaul laughs)

27:37.390 --> 27:38.256
and you're done in a gown.

27:38.257 --> 27:39.123
(RuPaul laughs)

27:39.125 --> 27:40.458
And mom has a piece
of sheer sequined fabric

27:40.459 --> 27:41.792
(RuPaul laughs)

27:41.794 --> 27:43.077
wrapped around
what looks to be a corset.

27:43.078 --> 27:44.361
(RuPaul laughs)

27:44.363 --> 27:45.029
Because this is "Allstars,"

27:45.030 --> 27:45.696
(RuPaul laughs)

27:45.698 --> 27:47.348
I think this was a bit lazy
tonight, and I expect more.

27:47.349 --> 27:48.999
(RuPaul laughs)

27:49.001 --> 27:50.534
- It could be because
you've been doing so well,

27:50.535 --> 27:52.068
(RuPaul laughs)

27:52.071 --> 27:52.603
expectation is so high.

27:52.604 --> 27:53.136
(RuPaul laughs)

27:53.139 --> 27:53.588
But this is the top five,

27:53.589 --> 27:54.038
(RuPaul laughs)

27:54.040 --> 27:56.357
so this wouldn't be the week
to not go 100% full out.

27:56.358 --> 27:58.675
(RuPaul laughs)

28:00.413 --> 28:05.182
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

28:05.184 --> 28:05.583
- I thought that you two

28:05.584 --> 28:05.983
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

28:05.985 --> 28:07.385
had the most cohesive
performance of the night.

28:07.386 --> 28:08.786
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

28:08.788 --> 28:09.186
If this was a lip sync,

28:09.187 --> 28:09.585
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

28:09.588 --> 28:10.954
I'm not quite sure which one
of you would be winning.

28:10.955 --> 28:12.321
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

28:12.324 --> 28:12.990
You were that good.

28:12.991 --> 28:13.657
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

28:13.659 --> 28:14.575
- I loved all of this.

28:14.576 --> 28:15.492
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

28:15.494 --> 28:16.510
I loved
the origami fascinators.

28:16.511 --> 28:17.527
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

28:17.530 --> 28:19.747
It's like Donatella Versace
for the Hunger Games.

28:19.748 --> 28:21.965
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

28:21.967 --> 28:23.634
- And the strongest family
resemblance.

28:23.635 --> 28:25.302
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

28:25.304 --> 28:26.320
I mean, it's unbelievable.

28:26.321 --> 28:27.337
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

28:27.339 --> 28:27.738
I'm just super proud

28:27.739 --> 28:28.138
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

28:28.140 --> 28:28.923
of the thought and the work
you put in tonight.

28:28.924 --> 28:29.707
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

28:29.709 --> 28:32.643
- Up next, Katya
and Svetlana Borisvitna.

28:32.644 --> 28:35.578
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

28:35.581 --> 28:36.130
How'd I do with the name?

28:36.131 --> 28:36.680
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

28:36.682 --> 28:37.181
- Terribly.
- Yeah.

28:37.182 --> 28:37.681
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

28:37.683 --> 28:38.415
Say it for me.
- Borisivna.

28:38.416 --> 28:39.148
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

28:39.151 --> 28:41.001
- And this is Svetlana
Borisvis--ahh.

28:41.002 --> 28:42.852
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

28:42.855 --> 28:43.270
(all laugh)

28:43.271 --> 28:43.686
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

28:43.689 --> 28:44.521
- I think
the vogue-ing thing

28:44.522 --> 28:45.354
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

28:45.357 --> 28:46.106
was not high up on the scale

28:46.107 --> 28:46.856
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

28:46.859 --> 28:48.492
of things I love to do
in life for Katya.

28:48.493 --> 28:50.126
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

28:50.129 --> 28:50.394
- Yeah.

28:50.395 --> 28:50.660
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

28:50.663 --> 28:51.779
- But then you came out here
with this storyline,

28:51.780 --> 28:52.896
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

28:52.898 --> 28:54.264
and I was like, yes.

28:54.265 --> 28:55.631
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

28:55.634 --> 28:57.384
- It just completely
flipped the switch for me.

28:57.385 --> 28:59.135
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

28:59.138 --> 28:59.520
It felt so Katya.

28:59.521 --> 28:59.903
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

28:59.905 --> 29:01.839
- You're giving us this, like,
vintage Misoni kind of look.

29:01.840 --> 29:03.774
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

29:03.776 --> 29:04.475
It's something
that they would wear

29:04.476 --> 29:05.175
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

29:05.177 --> 29:06.126
in Real Housewives of Minsk.

29:06.127 --> 29:07.076
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

29:07.079 --> 29:07.528
- Yes, it's--

29:07.529 --> 29:07.978
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

29:07.980 --> 29:09.179
- Really one of the highlights
of the evening.

29:09.180 --> 29:10.379
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

29:10.382 --> 29:10.798
- I will say, sidebar,

29:10.799 --> 29:11.215
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

29:11.217 --> 29:12.717
your mother
completely stole the show.

29:12.718 --> 29:14.218
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

29:14.220 --> 29:14.502
- Yes!

29:14.503 --> 29:14.785
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

29:14.787 --> 29:15.836
- Your acting,
I mean, you deserve

29:15.837 --> 29:16.886
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

29:16.889 --> 29:17.438
a Tony Award for that.

29:17.439 --> 29:17.988
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

29:17.990 --> 29:18.322
- Thank you.

29:18.323 --> 29:18.655
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

29:18.657 --> 29:20.591
- Up next is Roxxxy
and Raquel Andrews.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.526
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

29:22.528 --> 29:24.628
- You don't have to show
a lot of skin to be sexy,

29:24.629 --> 29:26.729
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

29:26.732 --> 29:28.082
and those suits were so hot.

29:28.083 --> 29:29.433
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

29:29.435 --> 29:30.301
- But I might've liked
some crazy accessory

29:30.302 --> 29:31.168
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

29:31.170 --> 29:33.420
or something else to just
make this look more drag runway.

29:33.421 --> 29:35.671
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

29:35.674 --> 29:36.340
- But you look sexy.

29:36.341 --> 29:37.007
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

29:37.009 --> 29:37.758
I hope you don't mind
me saying that.

29:37.759 --> 29:38.508
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

29:38.511 --> 29:39.276
- No. Oh, no, go ahead.

29:39.277 --> 29:40.042
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

29:40.045 --> 29:41.328
(all laugh)
- Calm down, mom.

29:41.329 --> 29:42.612
- Up next, Detox and D-rama.

29:42.815 --> 29:44.948
- Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

29:44.950 --> 29:47.634
Based on the judges' critiques,
I've made some decisions.

29:47.635 --> 29:50.319
- Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

29:52.158 --> 29:54.725
Detox,

29:54.727 --> 29:55.276
Katya,

29:55.277 --> 29:55.826
Detox,

29:55.828 --> 29:58.162
con-drag-ulations. You are the
two top Allstars of the week.

29:58.163 --> 30:00.497
Detox,

30:00.499 --> 30:01.498
You and your loved ones

30:01.499 --> 30:02.498
Detox,

30:02.501 --> 30:05.452
have each won a $2,000 gift
certificate from Marc Jacobs.

30:05.453 --> 30:08.404
Detox,

30:08.407 --> 30:09.607
- Wow.
- (laughs)

30:09.608 --> 30:10.808
Detox,

30:10.810 --> 30:13.594
- That means this week,
if you're not in the top...

30:13.595 --> 30:16.379
Detox,

30:16.949 --> 30:22.052
You are up for elimination.

30:22.054 --> 30:22.403
- Fuck.

30:22.404 --> 30:22.753
You are up for elimination.

30:22.755 --> 30:23.921
- You may leave the stage.

30:23.922 --> 30:25.088
You are up for elimination.

30:29.295 --> 30:32.729
- This feels like
the most difficult decision

30:32.731 --> 30:33.197
thus far in the competition

30:33.198 --> 30:33.664
- This feels like
the most difficult decision

30:33.666 --> 30:35.566
because we are determining
who gets to go into the final

30:35.567 --> 30:37.467
- This feels like
the most difficult decision

30:37.469 --> 30:39.086
and who has to go home.

30:39.087 --> 30:40.704
- This feels like
the most difficult decision

30:42.575 --> 30:47.344
Okay, so I'm detecting
a very solemn tone.

30:47.346 --> 30:47.761
- It is super solemn.

30:47.762 --> 30:48.177
Okay, so I'm detecting
a very solemn tone.

30:48.180 --> 30:49.580
Everyone did so fucking great
and then to put us in, like--

30:49.581 --> 30:50.981
Okay, so I'm detecting
a very solemn tone.

30:50.983 --> 30:52.349
- I didn't do great
this challenge.

30:52.350 --> 30:53.716
Okay, so I'm detecting
a very solemn tone.

30:53.719 --> 30:55.185
I got really
terrible critiques

30:55.186 --> 30:56.652
Okay, so I'm detecting
a very solemn tone.

30:56.655 --> 30:58.355
and I fucked up
and I feel terrible about it.

30:58.356 --> 31:00.056
Okay, so I'm detecting
a very solemn tone.

31:00.059 --> 31:02.726
And I'm sorry that I won so much
because it fucking sucks.

31:02.727 --> 31:05.394
Okay, so I'm detecting
a very solemn tone.

31:07.066 --> 31:08.332
- You're beating yourself up.

31:08.334 --> 31:09.383
- Yeah, you need
to just stop it.

31:09.384 --> 31:10.433
- You're beating yourself up.

31:10.436 --> 31:10.768
Just chill out.

31:10.769 --> 31:11.101
- You're beating yourself up.

31:11.103 --> 31:12.586
- No, I'm uncomfortable.
Drag fuckin hurts.

31:12.587 --> 31:14.070
- You're beating yourself up.

31:14.340 --> 31:19.343
I've tried to stay really
focused and really strong

31:19.345 --> 31:21.312
and not show any signs
of weakness,

31:21.313 --> 31:23.280
I've tried to stay really
focused and really strong

31:23.282 --> 31:25.332
and now
I'm not able to hide it.

31:25.333 --> 31:27.383
I've tried to stay really
focused and really strong

31:27.386 --> 31:29.453
I'm just feeling it
all crashing down around me.

31:29.454 --> 31:31.521
I've tried to stay really
focused and really strong

31:31.523 --> 31:32.372
- I want to talk to people.
- Sure.

31:32.373 --> 31:33.222
I've tried to stay really
focused and really strong

31:33.225 --> 31:34.108
- I don't know
if you need to or not.

31:34.109 --> 31:34.992
I've tried to stay really
focused and really strong

31:34.994 --> 31:35.793
So if you would like
to join me.

31:35.794 --> 31:36.593
I've tried to stay really
focused and really strong

31:36.595 --> 31:37.277
- Okay.
- Let's go.

31:37.278 --> 31:37.960
I've tried to stay really
focused and really strong

31:37.963 --> 31:38.779
- Let's do
a little one-on-one.

31:38.780 --> 31:39.596
I've tried to stay really
focused and really strong

31:39.598 --> 31:40.597
Alaska, you're up.
- Okay.

31:40.598 --> 31:41.597
I've tried to stay really
focused and really strong

31:41.600 --> 31:42.299
- I don't want
to see anybody go.

31:42.300 --> 31:42.999
I've tried to stay really
focused and really strong

31:43.002 --> 31:44.485
Everyone did a great job,
minus Alaska,

31:44.486 --> 31:45.969
I've tried to stay really
focused and really strong

31:45.971 --> 31:47.137
but she's been killing
the competition.

31:47.138 --> 31:48.304
I've tried to stay really
focused and really strong

31:48.307 --> 31:50.140
And I've known Roxxxy
for 13 years.

31:50.141 --> 31:51.974
I've tried to stay really
focused and really strong

31:51.977 --> 31:52.676
She's one of
my best friends.

31:52.677 --> 31:53.376
I've tried to stay really
focused and really strong

31:53.379 --> 31:54.929
How am I going to send
my best friend home?

31:54.930 --> 31:56.480
I've tried to stay really
focused and really strong

31:56.482 --> 31:57.848
What am I gonna
fucking do?

31:57.849 --> 31:59.215
I've tried to stay really
focused and really strong

32:02.121 --> 32:03.620
- You can come over here,
Roxxxy.

32:03.622 --> 32:04.588
Come over here.
- Get over here.

32:04.589 --> 32:05.555
- You can come over here,
Roxxxy.

32:06.225 --> 32:08.158
- We're sisters, all of us.

32:08.160 --> 32:09.176
- Right.
- You know that.

32:09.177 --> 32:10.193
- We're sisters, all of us.

32:10.195 --> 32:10.928
I personally feel like
it would be you,

32:10.929 --> 32:11.662
- We're sisters, all of us.

32:11.664 --> 32:14.165
but you've been in the bottom
five out of seven challenges.

32:14.166 --> 32:16.667
- We're sisters, all of us.

32:16.669 --> 32:17.651
Consistency.
- Right.

32:17.652 --> 32:18.634
- We're sisters, all of us.

32:18.637 --> 32:20.137
- It's Alaska's first time
in the bottom, my second time.

32:20.138 --> 32:21.638
- We're sisters, all of us.

32:21.640 --> 32:22.439
Going into the final four,

32:22.440 --> 32:23.239
- We're sisters, all of us.

32:23.242 --> 32:25.125
me and Alaska should be safe
just based off statistics.

32:25.126 --> 32:27.009
- We're sisters, all of us.

32:27.012 --> 32:28.011
Do you think that's fair,
though?

32:28.012 --> 32:29.011
- We're sisters, all of us.

32:29.014 --> 32:29.780
- On the last couple weeks,

32:29.781 --> 32:30.547
- We're sisters, all of us.

32:30.549 --> 32:31.298
I got my critiques
to be in the bottom.

32:31.299 --> 32:32.048
- We're sisters, all of us.

32:32.051 --> 32:33.017
I don't get today.
- But he didn't save nobody.

32:33.018 --> 32:33.984
- We're sisters, all of us.

32:33.986 --> 32:35.319
He said if you're not in
the top, you're in the bottom.

32:35.320 --> 32:36.653
- We're sisters, all of us.

32:36.655 --> 32:37.254
- I guess.

32:37.255 --> 32:37.854
- We're sisters, all of us.

32:37.856 --> 32:38.755
- I think Roxxxy
is feeling nervous.

32:38.756 --> 32:39.655
- We're sisters, all of us.

32:39.658 --> 32:41.358
She's been saved the last
three times consecutively.

32:41.359 --> 32:43.059
- We're sisters, all of us.

32:43.062 --> 32:44.161
But I think Roxxxy
has the upper hand on me

32:44.162 --> 32:45.261
- We're sisters, all of us.

32:45.264 --> 32:47.331
because she is
her good Judy.

32:47.332 --> 32:49.399
- We're sisters, all of us.

32:52.071 --> 32:54.004
- So what happened this week?
- I don't know.

32:54.006 --> 32:55.789
I guess all I can say is
I really want to stay

32:55.790 --> 32:57.573
- So what happened this week?
- I don't know.

32:57.576 --> 32:58.876
and I think
I deserve to stay.

32:58.877 --> 33:00.177
- So what happened this week?
- I don't know.

33:00.179 --> 33:01.278
- Alaska doesn't know me
very well,

33:01.279 --> 33:02.378
- So what happened this week?
- I don't know.

33:02.381 --> 33:03.313
and, you know,
if I win the lip sync,

33:03.314 --> 33:04.246
- So what happened this week?
- I don't know.

33:04.249 --> 33:06.083
I don't know that she's
100% sure I won't send her home

33:06.084 --> 33:07.918
- So what happened this week?
- I don't know.

33:07.920 --> 33:08.886
because she's
my biggest competition.

33:08.887 --> 33:09.853
- So what happened this week?
- I don't know.

33:09.855 --> 33:11.455
- I need to go to the end
of this competition.

33:11.456 --> 33:13.056
- So what happened this week?
- I don't know.

33:13.993 --> 33:15.726
I need to.

33:17.730 --> 33:19.763
- Party.

33:23.035 --> 33:24.501
- Okay.

33:24.503 --> 33:25.519
My heart is sinking.

33:25.520 --> 33:26.536
- Okay.

33:26.538 --> 33:28.605
I think my spleen
is going to explode.

33:28.606 --> 33:30.673
- Okay.

33:30.676 --> 33:31.408
Queens in the past

33:31.409 --> 33:32.141
- Okay.

33:32.144 --> 33:34.661
have completely disregarded
someone's past performance

33:34.662 --> 33:37.179
- Okay.

33:37.182 --> 33:37.798
and sent people home

33:37.799 --> 33:38.415
- Okay.

33:38.417 --> 33:40.134
because of a terrible critique
on the runway.

33:40.135 --> 33:41.852
- Okay.

33:41.854 --> 33:43.003
Even I, in the past.

33:43.004 --> 33:44.153
- Okay.

33:44.156 --> 33:44.738
So it's terrifying.

33:44.739 --> 33:45.321
- Okay.

33:45.324 --> 33:46.440
I fucked up this week, man.

33:46.441 --> 33:47.557
- Okay.

33:47.559 --> 33:49.026
I fucked up,
and it really sucks.

33:49.027 --> 33:50.494
- Okay.

33:50.496 --> 33:52.246
It fucking really
fucking sucks a lot.

33:52.247 --> 33:53.997
- Okay.

33:53.999 --> 33:55.215
And I need to be
in the final four,

33:55.216 --> 33:56.432
- Okay.

33:56.435 --> 33:57.618
and now I--now I'm
potentially looking at--

33:57.619 --> 33:58.802
- Okay.

33:58.804 --> 33:59.920
I'm not going--
I'm not going to be,

33:59.921 --> 34:01.037
- Okay.

34:01.040 --> 34:01.939
and it really fucking sucks.

34:01.940 --> 34:02.839
- Okay.

34:02.841 --> 34:04.191
- I'm shocked
with Alaska's behavior.

34:04.192 --> 34:05.542
- Okay.

34:05.544 --> 34:06.627
She's really acting
like a brat,

34:06.628 --> 34:07.711
- Okay.

34:07.713 --> 34:08.662
and it's not...

34:08.663 --> 34:09.612
- Okay.

34:09.615 --> 34:10.114
it's not attractive.

34:10.115 --> 34:10.614
- Okay.

34:10.616 --> 34:12.199
It might throw my thinking
process off of the elimination.

34:12.200 --> 34:13.783
- Okay.

34:13.786 --> 34:15.336
If you're going to act like
a brat, like, right now,

34:15.337 --> 34:16.887
- Okay.

34:16.889 --> 34:18.288
how are you going to act
the rest of this time here?

34:18.289 --> 34:19.688
- Okay.

34:19.691 --> 34:21.491
- Well, I'll give you $10,000
if you let me stay.

34:21.492 --> 34:23.292
- Okay.

34:23.295 --> 34:24.061
Before taxes.

34:24.062 --> 34:24.828
- Okay.

34:24.830 --> 34:25.529
I'll transfer it to you
via PayPal,

34:25.530 --> 34:26.229
- Okay.

34:26.231 --> 34:27.814
because I need to stay
in this competition.

34:27.815 --> 34:29.398
- Okay.

34:29.401 --> 34:30.901
I need to be
in the final four.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.402
- Okay.

34:34.239 --> 34:38.809
Acting this way
only exacerbates the problem.

34:38.811 --> 34:40.060
I know that.
I'm an adult.

34:40.061 --> 34:41.310
Acting this way
only exacerbates the problem.

34:41.313 --> 34:42.763
But it's like
the end of the road

34:42.764 --> 34:44.214
Acting this way
only exacerbates the problem.

34:44.216 --> 34:45.833
is flashing before my eyes.

34:45.834 --> 34:47.451
Acting this way
only exacerbates the problem.

34:47.453 --> 34:48.502
It's really hard to take.

34:48.503 --> 34:49.552
Acting this way
only exacerbates the problem.

34:55.327 --> 34:57.861
- This is such an
incredibly difficult decision

34:57.863 --> 35:00.147
because on the one hand, Alaska
absolutely performed the worst.

35:00.148 --> 35:02.432
- This is such an
incredibly difficult decision

35:02.434 --> 35:03.483
But then Roxxxy's
been in the bottom

35:03.484 --> 35:04.533
- This is such an
incredibly difficult decision

35:04.536 --> 35:05.552
consistently throughout
the competition

35:05.553 --> 35:06.569
- This is such an
incredibly difficult decision

35:06.572 --> 35:07.821
and Alyssa is somewhere
in the middle.

35:07.822 --> 35:09.071
- This is such an
incredibly difficult decision

35:09.074 --> 35:11.408
So I could make the case
for anyone to go home.

35:11.409 --> 35:13.743
- This is such an
incredibly difficult decision

35:16.115 --> 35:17.747
- I feel nauseous,

35:17.749 --> 35:19.349
and, you know, I just feel like
a dick no matter what happens.

35:19.350 --> 35:20.950
- I feel nauseous,

35:20.953 --> 35:22.686
I'm just going with
what my heart is telling me.

35:22.687 --> 35:24.420
- I feel nauseous,

35:24.423 --> 35:25.923
That's what I gotta do.

35:25.924 --> 35:27.424
- I feel nauseous,

35:30.229 --> 35:32.629
(RuPaul laughs)

35:33.432 --> 35:36.266
(RuPaul laughs)

35:39.905 --> 35:41.438
- Welcome back, ladies.

35:41.440 --> 35:43.123
Two top Allstars
stand before me.

35:43.124 --> 35:44.807
- Welcome back, ladies.

35:44.810 --> 35:47.094
Ladies, this is your chance
to impress me,

35:47.095 --> 35:49.379
- Welcome back, ladies.

35:49.381 --> 35:51.064
win $10,000
and earn the power

35:51.065 --> 35:52.748
- Welcome back, ladies.

35:52.751 --> 35:55.569
to give one of the bottom queens
the chop.

35:55.570 --> 35:58.388
- Welcome back, ladies.

35:59.424 --> 36:03.059
The time has come
to lip sync

36:03.061 --> 36:04.778
(echoing) for your legacy.

36:04.779 --> 36:06.496
The time has come
to lip sync

36:08.033 --> 36:12.769
Good luck
and don't fuck it up.

36:12.771 --> 36:13.587
- ¶ Step to the beat,
to the beat ¶

36:13.588 --> 36:14.404
Good luck
and don't fuck it up.

36:14.406 --> 36:14.755
¶ Go freaky ¶

36:14.756 --> 36:15.105
Good luck
and don't fuck it up.

36:15.107 --> 36:16.140
¶ Boom-shang-a-lang,
work that thang ¶

36:16.141 --> 36:17.174
Good luck
and don't fuck it up.

36:17.176 --> 36:17.658
All right now!

36:17.659 --> 36:18.141
Good luck
and don't fuck it up.

36:18.143 --> 36:19.109
All you biological females

36:19.110 --> 36:20.076
Good luck
and don't fuck it up.

36:20.078 --> 36:21.244
who used to have
the upper hand,

36:21.245 --> 36:22.411
Good luck
and don't fuck it up.

36:22.414 --> 36:23.146
it ain't like that
no more, honey.

36:23.147 --> 36:23.879
Good luck
and don't fuck it up.

36:23.882 --> 36:24.781
It's a-got real tough
up in here.

36:24.782 --> 36:25.681
Good luck
and don't fuck it up.

36:25.684 --> 36:27.134
You got your trisexual.
You got your bisexual.

36:27.135 --> 36:28.585
Good luck
and don't fuck it up.

36:28.587 --> 36:29.202
You got your inner sexual.

36:29.203 --> 36:29.818
Good luck
and don't fuck it up.

36:29.821 --> 36:31.188
You gonna have
to step your pussy up.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.556
Good luck
and don't fuck it up.

36:32.558 --> 36:33.374
Handy.

36:33.375 --> 36:34.191
Good luck
and don't fuck it up.

36:34.193 --> 36:35.376
Handy.

36:35.377 --> 36:36.560
Good luck
and don't fuck it up.

36:36.562 --> 36:37.077
Handy.

36:37.078 --> 36:37.593
Good luck
and don't fuck it up.

36:37.596 --> 36:38.211
- Yeah!

36:38.212 --> 36:38.827
Good luck
and don't fuck it up.

36:38.830 --> 36:39.996
- (laughs)

36:39.997 --> 36:41.163
Good luck
and don't fuck it up.

36:41.166 --> 36:41.765
Whoo!

36:41.766 --> 36:42.365
Good luck
and don't fuck it up.

36:42.367 --> 36:43.550
- (laughs)

36:43.551 --> 36:44.734
Good luck
and don't fuck it up.

36:45.003 --> 36:47.304
- ¶ If you're trying

37:36.855 --> 37:39.106
Ladies,
I've made my decision.

37:39.107 --> 37:41.358
¶ If you're trying
to be somebody ¶

37:43.929 --> 37:47.831
Detox,

37:47.833 --> 37:48.882
(applause)
- Yay.

37:48.883 --> 37:49.932

please step forward?

38:00.678 --> 38:02.478
Detox,
you're a winner, baby.

38:05.384 --> 38:10.353
Detox, with great power
comes great responsibility.

38:10.355 --> 38:12.956
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

38:12.957 --> 38:15.558
Detox, with great power
comes great responsibility.

38:15.560 --> 38:16.476
- On one hand,
you have Alaska,

38:16.477 --> 38:17.393
Detox, with great power
comes great responsibility.

38:17.396 --> 38:18.662
who has been slaying it
this entire competition.

38:18.663 --> 38:19.929
Detox, with great power
comes great responsibility.

38:19.931 --> 38:22.132
And then you have Alyssa,
who has also been slaying.

38:22.133 --> 38:24.334
Detox, with great power
comes great responsibility.

38:24.336 --> 38:25.168
And then you have
my best friend,

38:25.169 --> 38:26.001
Detox, with great power
comes great responsibility.

38:26.004 --> 38:27.287
who I feel like
there have been several times

38:27.288 --> 38:28.571
Detox, with great power
comes great responsibility.

38:28.573 --> 38:30.073
where she didn't necessarily
deserve to be in the bottom,

38:30.074 --> 38:31.574
Detox, with great power
comes great responsibility.

38:31.576 --> 38:32.409
and tonight, especially,
was one of them.

38:32.410 --> 38:33.243
Detox, with great power
comes great responsibility.

38:33.245 --> 38:35.412
And unfortunately,
I do have to make a decision.

38:35.413 --> 38:37.580
Detox, with great power
comes great responsibility.

38:40.585 --> 38:42.152
I chose Alyssa.
I'm sorry.

38:42.154 --> 38:43.420
I can't send her home.

38:45.490 --> 38:47.140
but I just couldn't
send Roxxxy home tonight

38:47.141 --> 38:48.791
I chose Alyssa.
I'm sorry.

38:48.794 --> 38:50.193
because she's been so amazing,
and I just couldn't do it.

38:50.194 --> 38:51.593
I chose Alyssa.
I'm sorry.

Today was so magical.

39:28.983 --> 39:29.398
I'm not angry.
I'm not upset.

39:29.401 --> 39:30.350
I had the opportunity
to work with my sister,

39:30.351 --> 39:31.300
I'm not angry.
I'm not upset.

39:31.303 --> 39:32.152
and I did everything
that I wanted to do.

39:32.153 --> 39:33.002
I'm not angry.
I'm not upset.

39:33.004 --> 39:34.037
I can't leave
this competition

39:34.038 --> 39:35.071
I'm not angry.
I'm not upset.

39:35.073 --> 39:36.840
with nothing other than
a sense of joy.

39:36.841 --> 39:38.608
I'm not angry.
I'm not upset.

39:38.610 --> 39:39.276

Don't cry.

39:46.051 --> 39:46.867
Why are you upset?

39:46.868 --> 39:47.684
Don't cry.

39:47.686 --> 39:49.186
- Because you're always
a winner to me.

39:49.187 --> 39:50.687
Don't cry.

39:50.689 --> 39:51.138
- That's all that matters.

39:51.139 --> 39:51.588
Don't cry.

39:51.590 --> 39:52.456

anybody else would've done.

39:52.457 --> 39:53.323
Don't cry.

They eliminated
their biggest competition.

39:54.575 --> 39:55.824
Don't cry.

Don't cry.

39:58.096 --> 39:59.796

right there!

39:59.797 --> 40:01.497
Don't cry.

40:01.500 --> 40:03.617
I'm leaving this
a better Alyssa than I came in.

40:03.618 --> 40:05.735
Don't cry.

40:05.737 --> 40:06.286
That's the win.

40:06.287 --> 40:06.836
Don't cry.

Don't cry.

40:10.876 --> 40:11.908

40:11.909 --> 40:12.941
