00:59.085 --> 01:01.424
God, forgive me.

01:40.359 --> 01:42.913
Mom was right about you! You're insane!

01:43.013 --> 01:46.624
- You're my sister and I do love you!
- What are you doing?

01:49.601 --> 01:52.872
What are you doing? No, don't do this.

02:11.023 --> 02:13.450
Only one more, baby.

02:14.543 --> 02:15.803
One more.

03:02.208 --> 03:05.245
Cameron, get up, I'm leaving soon.

03:05.945 --> 03:09.532
- Cameron, get up, now!
- I'm up!

03:17.206 --> 03:20.259
Oh, great, oh, hi, you finally woke up,
did you get enough sleep?

03:20.359 --> 03:23.012
- Morning to you too, Mom.
- I've been planning this retreat for months,

03:23.112 --> 03:25.481
the least you could've done is gotten up
early and helping out around here.

03:25.631 --> 03:29.960
- Calm down, Mom, what can I do?
- Take over!

03:30.569 --> 03:32.723
Over here. Come here.

03:33.572 --> 03:35.207
What's up, Granddad?

03:35.307 --> 03:38.610
But, Grandma, I'm trying to help,
he won't open his mouth.

03:38.710 --> 03:41.412
- I don't really care.
- I don't want eggs.

03:41.512 --> 03:44.316
- Angie you love eggs.
- Angie, eat it.

03:44.416 --> 03:47.423
What's up, turdburglars?
My unemployment check is late.

03:47.523 --> 03:49.989
Oh, Joey, let me get my purse.
I don't have time for this.

03:50.089 --> 03:53.893
- No, the mail-system sucks!
- Beer for breakfast again? What a surprise.

03:53.993 --> 03:57.965
What about, "Hey, how's my favorite uncle?"
"Good morning, Uncle Joey?"

03:58.065 --> 04:00.468
- Or, "hey, drop dead!"
- Drop dead.

04:00.568 --> 04:02.058
- Fucking got to...
- Ah, Jesus!

04:02.158 --> 04:04.175
- Jesus, Joey, take it.
- Yeah, well, you're a dick.

04:04.275 --> 04:06.205
- You're a dick!
- You guys stop, enough, take this.

04:06.305 --> 04:07.876
- You go over here.
- You're such an asshole!

04:07.976 --> 04:10.777
Angie, go, go to your room and eat
your food there, right now.

04:10.877 --> 04:13.946
You get away from me,
you help me, right now, let's go.

04:14.046 --> 04:16.050
- Now, Cameron, I need help packing!
- Oh, my God.

04:16.149 --> 04:20.086
Geez, why am I getting yelled at?
Uncle Joey doesn't do anything around here.

04:20.185 --> 04:22.221
- What the hell is his problem?
- Language, Cameron.

04:22.321 --> 04:23.990
I don't know why Nanny lets him live here.

04:24.090 --> 04:26.458
For the same reason
she lets us live here, we're family.

04:26.558 --> 04:29.729
- You can't pick your family, honey.
- Eliza!

04:29.829 --> 04:33.692
- One minute, Mom.
- Eliza, I can't find my pills.

04:33.792 --> 04:37.904
Will you please help me finish packing?
And get my sleeping bag from the cellar?

04:38.004 --> 04:40.864
Come here, I love you.

05:08.067 --> 05:11.170
Uncle Cameron,
I have something to show you.

05:11.570 --> 05:12.571
Hi.

05:12.671 --> 05:16.175
When are we gonna see Mom, you promised.

05:16.275 --> 05:18.937
Shh! I told you, I'm working on it.

05:20.012 --> 05:22.214
Why doesn't Grandma like Mom?

05:22.314 --> 05:25.317
Hey, Grandma loves Mom.

05:25.417 --> 05:28.304
She just doesn't want you
around her when she's sick.

05:30.522 --> 05:32.550
I made a painting for Mom.

05:34.293 --> 05:37.764
- Where is the baby going?
- It's Jamie.

05:37.864 --> 05:41.759
I'm trying to grab his hand
to stop him from going to heaven.

05:43.135 --> 05:45.373
Do you remember your twin brother?

05:46.105 --> 05:48.632
Only in pictures.

05:50.576 --> 05:54.346
Well, it's beautiful,
and your mom's gonna love it.

05:57.583 --> 06:00.360
For the last time,
I don't want Angie around her, move!

06:00.620 --> 06:02.388
Mom, she has the right
to see her real mother.

06:02.488 --> 06:06.025
Actually, she doesn't, all right, the court
has decided that when her mother overdosed,

06:06.125 --> 06:08.260
or did you forget
your sister is an addict?

06:08.360 --> 06:13.399
- Did you forget you're an alcoholic?
- Cameron. I've been sober for 12 years.

06:13.499 --> 06:16.452
Yeah, well, Mom, when you were getting
sober you still had the right to see us.

06:16.652 --> 06:19.205
Cameron, I was drinking,
Caitlin's a junkie!

06:19.305 --> 06:22.474
So those mistakes make her
less fit to be a mom than you?

06:22.574 --> 06:25.144
Oh, that's it, move,
this discussion is over.

06:25.244 --> 06:28.280
- Hey, someone's cranky.
- Cameron.

06:28.380 --> 06:31.083
Listen, I pray for Caitlin, I do.

06:31.183 --> 06:34.253
But I lost one grandchild because of her,
and I'm not gonna lose another, okay?

06:34.353 --> 06:36.723
- So that's it?
- That's it.

06:36.823 --> 06:41.107
Listen, Uncle Joey said that he'd help with
Angie, all right, so no fighting, promise?

06:41.207 --> 06:43.430
You trust douchebag Uncle Joey
with Angie but not Caitlin?

06:43.530 --> 06:46.633
Stop in, and Aunt Jean is gonna come
this weekend, check in, all right?

06:46.733 --> 06:49.125
- What am I, five?
- No, you're not five,

06:49.225 --> 06:52.616
but Nanny would like to see her other
daughter once in a while, okay?

06:53.805 --> 06:56.708
Besides, it'll give you
the night off, okay?

06:56.808 --> 06:59.178
- You worry too much.
- I worry too much?

06:59.278 --> 07:03.615
Come here, give me a hug,
I'm an expert at it. I'll miss you, be good.

07:03.715 --> 07:06.652
Yeah, I won't burn down the house
or kill anybody or anything, so.

07:06.752 --> 07:09.321
- I love you.
- Sure.

07:09.421 --> 07:11.527
I love you too, Mom.

07:22.885 --> 07:26.479
- Angie?
- Come find me, Uncle Cameron!

07:27.139 --> 07:29.008
Angie!

07:34.646 --> 07:38.717
- Hey, let me out!
- Give me one good reason to let you out.

07:38.817 --> 07:41.912
Now, Uncle Cameron!

07:44.190 --> 07:46.428
Pretty soon you're gonna need
a new hiding spot.

07:46.528 --> 07:49.428
When you go to college,
who's gonna come find me here?

07:49.528 --> 07:51.163
Hmm...

07:51.263 --> 07:53.199
Looks like I'm not going to college.

07:53.299 --> 07:57.269
- Are you ready to go see Momma?
- But Grandma said we can't go.

07:57.369 --> 08:00.399
Well, guess what.
I'm in charge now, and I say it's okay.

08:00.499 --> 08:03.575
But if you say one word, though, lady.
Go get your jacket.

08:03.675 --> 08:05.502
Okay.

08:07.846 --> 08:10.240
Where are you taking her?

08:10.382 --> 08:12.642
I'm taking her to the zoo.

08:21.393 --> 08:23.395
Don't come here no more,
why do you keep calling?

08:23.495 --> 08:25.564
He is your son and you'll need to see him!

08:25.664 --> 08:27.967
You just want money, I ain't got no money.

08:28.067 --> 08:30.803
I don't want your dirty money.
I know where you get your money.

08:30.903 --> 08:33.198
You have responsibilities...

09:03.435 --> 09:06.072
- Hi!
- Mom!

09:06.172 --> 09:08.065
Oh...

09:25.924 --> 09:29.528
So tell me, how did you convince Mom
to let you come here today?

09:29.628 --> 09:33.346
Well, Grandma doesn't know
about this little adventure, so...

09:33.446 --> 09:35.667
- ...keep it a secret, right, Angie?
- Mm-hmm.

09:35.767 --> 09:38.437
Oh, disobeying Mom, I approve.

09:38.537 --> 09:43.133
Well, she will kill me
if she finds out, so. Not a peep.

09:45.811 --> 09:49.015
How you doing... you know?

09:49.415 --> 09:54.120
I'm good. Um, staying clean.

09:54.220 --> 09:58.730
Trying to stay on track
and keep going to work.

09:59.741 --> 10:01.775
For you.

10:06.698 --> 10:09.601
- What's going on over there?
- There's been awful fights all week.

10:09.701 --> 10:13.472
- It's just been terrible.
- Did you call the cops?

10:13.572 --> 10:16.442
In this neighborhood,
there's really no point.

10:16.542 --> 10:19.710
Around here,
it's better to mind your own business.

10:19.930 --> 10:22.548
Uncle Cameron, don't go!

10:27.719 --> 10:30.889
Hey! Hey, what the fuck are you doing?

10:32.358 --> 10:34.676
- Get off of me.
- No!

10:34.776 --> 10:37.696
- Get her away, man!
- You're letting him get away.

10:37.796 --> 10:40.849
What the hell are you doing here?
He was the last one!

10:40.949 --> 10:44.403
- What's going on here?
- I'm here to help you, calm down, calm down!

10:44.503 --> 10:47.806
- I'm gonna call the cops.
- What happened, just tell me what happened.

10:47.906 --> 10:50.562
I'm here to help!

10:50.662 --> 10:52.061
- Are you bleeding?
- Stupido!

10:52.161 --> 10:54.283
- Who was that guy?
- This is all your fault.

10:54.383 --> 10:57.616
All right, slow down, slow down.
Tell me exactly what happened.

10:57.716 --> 11:00.152
- I can't believe you let him get away.
- What's your name?

11:00.252 --> 11:04.123
She's coming, she's coming,
I have to save my baby.

11:04.223 --> 11:07.288
- My sister is calling the cops.
- I have to save my baby.

11:08.994 --> 11:11.889
- What are you doing here?
- We're here to help!

11:14.733 --> 11:17.003
Let me help you!

11:17.103 --> 11:19.539
Tell me what happened.

11:20.639 --> 11:22.709
Calm down!

11:23.109 --> 11:25.154
No, no!

11:26.928 --> 11:29.799
- Angie!
- No, don't, don't!

11:29.899 --> 11:33.269
Angie, Angie, Angie!

11:33.519 --> 11:35.446
My baby!

11:40.526 --> 11:43.495
No, he's gone!

11:43.995 --> 11:46.657
No, no!

11:48.667 --> 11:50.493
Angie?

12:03.114 --> 12:07.053
- What's wrong with her?
- She'll be okay.

12:07.653 --> 12:10.522
What about the baby, was there not a baby?

12:10.622 --> 12:13.993
Listen, let's let the cops
deal with this one.

12:14.093 --> 12:18.255
I called Dr. Mendez, he said he can
come by the house in about an hour.

12:21.350 --> 12:24.169
What if she caught whatever that baby had?

12:27.306 --> 12:29.632
You better get outta here.

12:32.611 --> 12:35.614
- Just call me, okay?
- As soon as I figure things out.

12:35.714 --> 12:39.307
All right, take her. Come on, baby.

12:42.921 --> 12:45.014
Bye, guys.

13:53.792 --> 13:55.818
Eliza!

14:29.995 --> 14:32.998
Jesus, Nanny, oh, my God.

14:33.098 --> 14:35.234
Where's your mother?

14:35.334 --> 14:39.662
Nanny, she went on a retreat.
You know that.

14:44.142 --> 14:46.403
Let me help you.

14:49.948 --> 14:51.950
Are you comfy?

14:52.050 --> 14:55.196
Oh, not the comforter, it's too hot.

14:58.224 --> 15:03.362
- If you need anything else...
- I want a good night kiss from Angie.

15:03.562 --> 15:06.532
She's sick, she's already in bed.

15:06.632 --> 15:08.199
Oh...

15:08.299 --> 15:11.647
Poor thing. She's so sweet.

15:11.747 --> 15:14.431
Hand me my book, honey.

15:21.880 --> 15:26.743
- Good night, Nanny.
- Take care of Angie, Cam.

16:00.619 --> 16:03.989
You really just need to chill, it's probably
just a little cold or something.

16:04.089 --> 16:07.493
Yeah, and you weren't there,
I'm telling you.

16:07.593 --> 16:11.530
Don't be so dramatic.
You sound like your mom.

16:11.630 --> 16:13.532
Hmm.

16:13.632 --> 16:16.755
Shoot me now, please, oh...

16:20.338 --> 16:24.309
I swear, I heard something coming up,
like from under the bed.

16:24.509 --> 16:28.847
- Like weird breathing.
- Oh, weird breathing?

16:28.947 --> 16:30.774
Yeah.

16:36.321 --> 16:38.624
- That's not funny.
- It's funny.

16:38.724 --> 16:41.985
- No, it's not.
- It's kinda funny.

16:45.964 --> 16:50.201
That's what you get for smoking this.
Where did you get this stuff anyway?

16:50.301 --> 16:51.903
From my Uncle Joey's stash.

16:52.003 --> 16:55.732
Creepy Uncle Joey?
No wonder it tastes so cheap.

17:02.781 --> 17:07.250
You know, this is kinda creepy to do
with your sister and Angie watching.

17:11.021 --> 17:15.518
So, have you given it any more thought
to going to college with me after summer?

17:16.327 --> 17:18.921
I've been a bit preoccupied around here.

17:21.500 --> 17:24.993
God, you're making excuses again.

17:25.867 --> 17:28.840
- Look, I told you I'd think about it.
- This is our future, Cameron.

17:28.940 --> 17:31.677
- I know, Megan.
- You graduated a year ago.

17:31.777 --> 17:34.612
You wanna end up like your uncle,
or your mom?

17:34.712 --> 17:38.107
Come on, how long are you gonna wait
to start your own life?

17:41.937 --> 17:43.696
Hey.

17:48.393 --> 17:50.620
Do you like it?

18:18.323 --> 18:21.957
- Angie, Angie!
- What, Cam, what the hell?

18:22.057 --> 18:23.523
Jesus!

18:30.285 --> 18:32.120
Angie.

18:34.840 --> 18:37.700
Oh, you know you need to be in bed.

18:43.765 --> 18:46.069
I'm not doing this right now.

18:51.723 --> 18:54.219
Angie, come on. Get out of there!

19:05.637 --> 19:07.773
Oh, my God.

19:07.873 --> 19:09.766
Angie.

19:13.178 --> 19:16.581
I'm telling you, Caitlin.
Something isn't right.

19:16.681 --> 19:19.250
You should've seen the look
in Angie's eyes.

19:19.350 --> 19:21.352
Do you have any idea
how insane that sounds?

19:21.452 --> 19:25.323
I mean, seriously, you probably just
smoked something that you shouldn't have.

19:25.423 --> 19:28.660
Okay, can we talk about
your hallucinations later please?

19:28.760 --> 19:32.110
Angie's gonna be just fine. The doctor said
that I just need you to watch her, okay?

19:32.430 --> 19:34.232
Love you.

19:34.332 --> 19:36.659
See you later, let yourself out.

19:58.232 --> 20:00.617
I know you're in there.

20:03.895 --> 20:08.491
- Go away.
- Come on. I gotta talk to you.

20:09.034 --> 20:11.236
Please. It's my niece.

20:11.336 --> 20:16.041
- I have nothing to say to you.
- No, help me, please.

20:16.141 --> 20:20.011
Listen, whatever the reason is you
hate me, don't take it out on my niece.

20:20.111 --> 20:22.505
She's just a little girl.

20:28.019 --> 20:30.680
All you need to know, is in here.

20:43.669 --> 20:46.110
- Who are these people?
- They were chosen,

20:46.210 --> 20:49.298
so that a child could be saved.

20:51.542 --> 20:55.288
Their deaths were wasted, they always are.

20:56.381 --> 21:00.286
She dares you to try, but she knows.

21:01.186 --> 21:03.392
You will fail.

21:03.705 --> 21:06.298
Who are you talking about?

21:07.325 --> 21:10.596
She's the child-stealer,
her name is Lilith.

21:11.496 --> 21:13.965
She was Adam's first wife.

21:14.265 --> 21:17.293
What do you mean, Adam and Eve, Adam?

21:25.443 --> 21:29.362
Banished from the Garden of Eden
after refusing subservience to Adam,

21:29.462 --> 21:33.051
as God commanded, Lilith was punished.

21:33.451 --> 21:37.122
Her mouth was sealed. Her womb was cursed.

21:37.222 --> 21:39.470
She would never bear children.

21:41.442 --> 21:45.401
Lilith became a creature of darkness,
making a pact with Lucifer

21:45.501 --> 21:51.419
to grant her unholy powers to steal
the offspring of Adam and Eve.

21:51.569 --> 21:54.163
...children for her.

22:01.096 --> 22:04.924
So what are you telling me
is that Lilith has Angie?

22:05.383 --> 22:08.911
No, not yet.

22:09.687 --> 22:13.809
- There's still time to save her.
- I should go.

22:13.909 --> 22:17.645
The cost of a soul,
Angie's soul comes at a price.

22:17.745 --> 22:22.039
- Obviously you've been through of a lot...
- Sacrifice, it's the only way.

22:22.350 --> 22:25.942
You need to offer six other lives
to Lilith in little Angie's place,

22:26.042 --> 22:29.257
six lives from her bloodline,
from your family.

22:29.357 --> 22:33.637
What do you want me to do?
Are you expecting me to kill them?

22:35.814 --> 22:37.139
No.

22:39.334 --> 22:41.127
You...

22:42.203 --> 22:44.263
mark them.

22:47.575 --> 22:49.778
Lilith does the taking.

22:49.878 --> 22:54.174
You have six days to mark
six members of the blood line.

22:55.550 --> 22:58.186
And if you fail, Angie will be gone.

22:58.286 --> 23:01.539
- Where is your baby?
- I almost saved him.

23:01.639 --> 23:03.959
And then you showed up.

23:04.059 --> 23:05.594
- You let my ex-husband escape.
- Okay.

23:05.694 --> 23:08.429
- He would've been the last.
- Okay, okay.

23:08.529 --> 23:12.400
- I wish you were dead, and not my boy.
- But this is fucked up.

23:12.500 --> 23:15.836
But I can't stand the thought of that
little girl going through the same thing.

23:15.936 --> 23:18.206
I spent three days
trying to understand this.

23:18.306 --> 23:22.735
I wasted time on doctors,
PIs, paranormal experts.

23:23.044 --> 23:25.346
Everything I could think of
to save my baby.

23:25.446 --> 23:28.983
Three of my six days, and now he is gone.

23:32.687 --> 23:35.101
You don't have time.

23:36.657 --> 23:40.687
- You need help.
- I'm not the one who needs help right now.

23:44.499 --> 23:47.026
If I were to choose six people...

23:48.803 --> 23:52.873
- how would I choose 'em?
- The first one is unbearable.

23:52.973 --> 23:55.367
And then it gets harder.

24:25.723 --> 24:27.542
Cameron!

25:30.905 --> 25:34.133
Oh, my sweet Angie.

25:36.344 --> 25:38.805
Nanny's here.

25:58.516 --> 26:00.640
Cameron.

26:29.064 --> 26:30.890
Nanny?

26:35.986 --> 26:37.844
Nanny?

26:41.876 --> 26:43.770
Nanny?

26:52.437 --> 26:54.330
Grandpa?

26:58.343 --> 26:59.978
Grandpa?

27:04.249 --> 27:06.075
Grandpa?

27:08.569 --> 27:10.696
Are you okay?

27:13.808 --> 27:16.035
Are you okay?

27:22.917 --> 27:24.876
What?

27:26.554 --> 27:28.389
Grandpa?

27:28.489 --> 27:31.050
Say it, say it.

27:36.731 --> 27:38.966
Jesus, Nanny!

28:08.929 --> 28:11.457
Oh, fuck.

28:17.071 --> 28:19.565
Oh, fuck.

28:22.944 --> 28:25.413
I'm sorry, Nanny.

29:23.037 --> 29:24.797
Hello?

29:26.106 --> 29:28.634
Yeah, Mom, I'm here.

29:29.710 --> 29:31.612
No, no, no.

29:31.712 --> 29:35.583
No, Angie has just run into fever.
It's nothing too serious.

29:35.683 --> 29:38.610
Yes, Mom, I called Dr. Mendez.

29:40.405 --> 29:43.859
She's in bed already. She took her pill.

29:43.959 --> 29:47.311
Okay, thank you, Mom, thank you.
I gotta go.

30:12.687 --> 30:16.156
Okay, so what does this book mean?

30:16.256 --> 30:19.126
And where is Nanny, Cameron?

30:19.226 --> 30:23.564
Why won't you believe me?
You need to trust me on this one.

30:23.964 --> 30:29.637
Okay, so, Lilith is a demon
and you sacrificed Nanny to her?

30:29.737 --> 30:33.108
Although that bitch probably deserves it,
I mean, come on, Cameron.

30:33.208 --> 30:37.445
- I'm not lying, Caitlin.
- Okay.

30:46.854 --> 30:48.723
Caitlin?

30:49.323 --> 30:51.176
Caitlin?

30:51.276 --> 30:54.936
Caitlin? Caitlin!

30:55.513 --> 30:56.914
Holy shit!

31:05.573 --> 31:10.595
- Caitlin, it won't open! What the fuck!
- Hey! Hey!

31:19.103 --> 31:21.206
I need a drink.

31:21.356 --> 31:24.383
Caitlin, that's not gonna fix anything.

31:25.025 --> 31:29.467
What we need is five more people,
and we only have four days to go.

31:29.567 --> 31:33.334
- And what are you gonna do?
- Well, I can't do this alone.

31:33.434 --> 31:37.922
Okay, well, how do we choose?

31:38.022 --> 31:41.859
- It has to be from our bloodline.
- Well, who's gonna be next?

31:41.959 --> 31:44.795
Boo! Like a little girl!

31:44.895 --> 31:48.474
Pussy! That was awesome!

33:11.666 --> 33:14.325
What are you doing, dumbass?

33:14.869 --> 33:18.438
Uh, I'm grabbing this aspirin for Angie.

33:18.538 --> 33:20.399
Yeah.

33:22.710 --> 33:25.270
Whatever, man, just take it.

33:27.081 --> 33:29.676
Oh, Cameron.

33:33.087 --> 33:36.557
I just want you to know, uh,
I hope Angie's okay.

33:36.657 --> 33:39.727
I checked on her earlier,
she didn't look too good.

33:39.827 --> 33:42.153
You checked on her?

33:42.780 --> 33:44.982
Yeah, man.

33:45.082 --> 33:47.185
Yeah, I do care, okay?

33:47.785 --> 33:50.211
It's kinda hard to tell.

33:50.855 --> 33:53.382
I mean, we are family, right?

33:53.741 --> 33:57.978
Yeah, yeah. I guess we are.

33:58.078 --> 34:00.215
Yeah, we are.

34:00.615 --> 34:04.610
- Did you check on Nanny?
- Aunt Jean has picked her up.

34:05.185 --> 34:08.356
- Without dad?
- Well, yeah, they just went to dinner, so.

34:08.456 --> 34:11.181
She said she'd be back soon.

34:11.281 --> 34:13.619
Ah, whatever.

34:14.360 --> 34:17.123
- Shut the door for me, will you?
- Yeah.

34:35.415 --> 34:37.243
Caitlin.

34:39.620 --> 34:43.081
It's done. We just have to wait a bit.

35:38.178 --> 35:40.072
Oh, shit.

36:10.110 --> 36:12.438
Hey, beautiful.

36:14.114 --> 36:15.883
Meg.

36:15.983 --> 36:19.419
- Where did you come from?
- I missed you.

36:19.519 --> 36:22.548
Oh, I miss you, too.

36:23.223 --> 36:25.717
Why are you sleeping?

36:26.644 --> 36:28.937
I'm so tired.

36:29.363 --> 36:31.923
It's been such a long week.

36:33.500 --> 36:36.394
But you don't have time to sleep.

36:40.540 --> 36:43.811
Hey, hey, Cam, Cam, wake up!

36:43.911 --> 36:46.972
Hey, it's time.

36:48.282 --> 36:50.283
Come on.

37:25.385 --> 37:28.448
Caitlin, his arm, his arm.

37:56.817 --> 38:00.308
- So how do we do this?
- You don't need to stay here for this.

38:00.888 --> 38:03.048
No, I...

38:04.224 --> 38:09.305
- I need to see this.
- Caitlin, I'm gonna take care of this. Go!

38:24.278 --> 38:26.071
Damn.

38:50.855 --> 38:53.481
What the fuck...

38:55.109 --> 38:57.202
What the...

39:04.451 --> 39:06.211
Huh?

39:17.998 --> 39:19.925
Where are you going?

39:33.213 --> 39:35.506
What happened?

39:39.453 --> 39:42.657
- I'm sorry, I couldn't.
- Hold still.

39:42.757 --> 39:45.259
He was just lying there,
and he just woke up.

39:45.359 --> 39:48.295
- You still had time to make the symbol.
- He was awake, Caitlin.

39:48.395 --> 39:50.564
We don't have time to wait
for natural causes,

39:50.664 --> 39:52.566
I don't know what you
don't understand about that.

39:52.666 --> 39:54.568
I don't see you volunteering
to cut your finger

39:54.668 --> 39:58.438
- and eternally damn your family members.
- I'm not gonna lose Angie, Cam.

39:58.538 --> 40:03.112
Since when do you care about Angie?
Or didn't you think I would notice?

40:05.895 --> 40:09.249
- I'm gonna go.
- Caitlin, don't run away from this.

40:09.349 --> 40:13.187
Caitlin! Wait, I forgot,
it's not your fault.

40:13.287 --> 40:18.225
But you know what, it is. Okay, you have
a daughter who loves and adores you.

40:18.325 --> 40:20.978
When Angie needs you the most,
you're walking out.

40:21.078 --> 40:23.647
You know maybe Mom was right.
Maybe you don't deserve Angie.

40:23.797 --> 40:27.234
Hey! You know what,
maybe I'm a fuck-up, okay?

40:27.334 --> 40:29.636
But you are the one
that brought this thing on Angie.

40:29.736 --> 40:34.550
You are the one who put her life in danger.
You are the one who's gonna take care of it.

40:44.919 --> 40:46.678
Hey, Megan.

40:49.589 --> 40:53.685
- You're pregnant?
- That's your reaction?

40:54.661 --> 40:56.196
It's been a fucked-up week.

40:56.296 --> 41:00.482
I'm sorry to inconvenience you,
but we have some decisions here.

41:02.736 --> 41:07.066
- I can't do this right now, Megan.
- What can be more important than this?

41:09.443 --> 41:13.639
Look, I know you don't wanna
sacrifice your life for a kid.

41:17.918 --> 41:22.963
- Megan, you told me you were on the pill.
- I am. It doesn't always work.

41:29.796 --> 41:32.266
Cam, we have to make a choice.

41:32.366 --> 41:34.826
It's life and death.

41:35.235 --> 41:37.416
It's not an easy choice.

41:38.572 --> 41:40.740
Yeah, well.

41:40.840 --> 41:43.168
I wanna keep it.

41:44.578 --> 41:47.105
I can't do this right now.

41:47.214 --> 41:49.749
I just need some time.

41:49.849 --> 41:54.822
Fine. You know, take all the time
you want, it's not like we're on the clock.

41:54.922 --> 41:57.215
Jesus, Cam.

42:46.640 --> 42:48.933
You're good?

42:51.511 --> 42:55.707
All righty.
You missed a button right here.

43:00.070 --> 43:02.598
You're looking sharp today, Grandpa.

43:13.367 --> 43:17.629
Granddad, you must be wondering
where Nanny is.

43:29.916 --> 43:32.152
You know, I miss you, Grandpa.

43:32.252 --> 43:35.054
I really wish you were here to help me.

43:41.295 --> 43:42.688
What?

43:55.442 --> 43:58.245
- Can I help you?
- No.

43:58.345 --> 44:00.915
But I can help you, Cameron.

44:01.015 --> 44:03.308
May I come in?

44:13.260 --> 44:17.022
Lilith... she's here.

44:18.965 --> 44:21.226
What do you know about Lilith?

44:24.738 --> 44:27.298
She took my little girl.

44:29.443 --> 44:31.802
A long time ago.

44:48.062 --> 44:50.688
Well, did you...

44:51.498 --> 44:55.102
Sacrifice anyone, no.

44:55.202 --> 44:58.138
I went through six days
of hell not knowing.

44:58.238 --> 45:00.941
I had a way, a chance.

45:01.041 --> 45:05.795
Lilith was haunting me,
mocking me, the whole time.

45:05.945 --> 45:08.273
That's what she does.

45:09.349 --> 45:11.776
She took Rebeca.

45:13.620 --> 45:16.281
Then I became a nun.

45:17.624 --> 45:21.219
- How did you find us?
- The book.

45:22.262 --> 45:25.356
The book Sabrina gave you, I wrote it.

45:25.699 --> 45:29.027
I've been tracking her for years.

45:29.736 --> 45:31.755
Helping anyone I can.

45:31.855 --> 45:36.184
Trying to find a way to banish
the unholy beast back to hell.

45:36.643 --> 45:39.320
Have you managed to offer her anyone?

45:42.916 --> 45:45.142
My nanny.

45:46.052 --> 45:48.513
My grandmother.

45:50.157 --> 45:52.417
She fell.

45:53.960 --> 45:56.997
So she was pretty much
already dying when I found her.

45:57.697 --> 45:59.957
You got lucky.

46:00.267 --> 46:03.637
Or maybe you do have
some stones after all.

46:03.737 --> 46:08.033
But three days down,
you're gonna have to push harder.

46:14.548 --> 46:18.651
A nun is encouraging me
to kill my own family?

46:18.751 --> 46:22.322
All of us are marked by years.

46:22.422 --> 46:24.815
By bad habits.

46:25.925 --> 46:30.021
Mediocre deaths and the ease of it
come into our petty lives.

46:32.699 --> 46:34.734
But the children.

46:34.834 --> 46:37.662
They are Tabula Rasa.

46:39.539 --> 46:41.932
An empty slate.

46:43.610 --> 46:46.938
Greatness can be written there.

46:48.247 --> 46:53.425
There's no worse sin than letting a pure
soul be a servant to that slut in hell.

46:55.789 --> 46:58.396
That still makes me a killer.

47:17.477 --> 47:19.813
- Aunt Jean, Randy.
- Hi.

47:19.913 --> 47:22.182
- Hi.
- I thought you guys were coming tomorrow.

47:22.282 --> 47:25.717
Hosting a women's luncheon,
last minute, now tomorrow, so...

47:25.817 --> 47:28.855
as promised to your mother,
I'm checking in.

47:28.955 --> 47:31.658
Is this a bad time?

47:31.758 --> 47:34.794
No, no, well, maybe a little bit.

47:34.894 --> 47:37.797
Where's your grandmother, upstairs?

47:37.897 --> 47:42.202
- She's out.
- Out? Where did she go?

47:42.302 --> 47:43.937
The doctors.

47:44.037 --> 47:48.066
Yeah, they said she was gonna be a while,
so I just came back home.

47:48.742 --> 47:52.679
Not gonna ask about my brother,
but what about little Angie?

47:52.779 --> 47:55.549
She's sick and she's in bed.

47:55.649 --> 47:58.865
Oh, I hope I don't catch
whatever it is she has.

47:58.965 --> 47:59.903
It's just the cold.

48:00.053 --> 48:02.589
- I am so susceptible to colds.
- True.

48:02.689 --> 48:06.493
Well, I guess we'll just wait here until
it's time to go pick your grandmother up,

48:06.593 --> 48:08.262
and then we'll get her with you.

48:08.362 --> 48:12.366
- Would you guys like something to drink?
- A drink would be nice.

48:12.466 --> 48:14.768
Orange juice, some warm milk?

48:14.868 --> 48:17.571
Well, I don't suppose Eliza keeps
alcohol in the house anymore.

48:17.671 --> 48:19.606
Uncle Joey has beer.

48:19.706 --> 48:22.977
- Shocking.
- Whatever.

48:23.677 --> 48:25.936
Be right back.

48:29.316 --> 48:31.150
So how hard does it blow to live here?

48:31.250 --> 48:34.788
It's got this kinda like
antique shithole vibe about it.

48:34.888 --> 48:37.941
If your mom would've married into money
like mine did, you might better off,

48:38.041 --> 48:40.127
but my mom's a total milf, so.

48:40.227 --> 48:42.396
I don't wanna think
of Aunt Jean like that.

48:42.496 --> 48:47.033
Oh, come on, your mom is totally doable.
In that born-again Christian kinda way.

48:47.133 --> 48:51.396
- That is fucked up.
- Yeah, it is.

48:51.971 --> 48:54.574
So must be tough getting laid
living in your grandma's house.

48:54.674 --> 48:57.131
Well, I have a girlfriend, so, not really.

48:57.231 --> 48:59.313
You're straight?

48:59.413 --> 49:01.381
Hmm.

49:01.481 --> 49:04.963
Pfft, so what happened to your finger?

49:06.135 --> 49:08.096
I was...

49:10.023 --> 49:14.227
I was cutting up XTC. I was at a party.
You know, and the razor slipped.

49:14.327 --> 49:17.997
What a noob.
Have any extra, I'll buy it off you.

49:18.097 --> 49:21.526
- Yeah, give me a minute.
- Nice!

50:03.076 --> 50:05.336
Sweet!

50:13.119 --> 50:16.214
- Cameron.
- I'm in Angie's room.

50:16.756 --> 50:19.250
Hide your drugs in Angie's room?

50:19.626 --> 50:21.852
That's genius.

50:31.104 --> 50:33.464
I'll call you back.

50:33.957 --> 50:35.783
Randy?

50:37.326 --> 50:39.186
Cameron?

50:54.427 --> 50:56.330
Get up here.

50:56.430 --> 50:59.933
Look, man, it's nothing personal.

51:00.033 --> 51:02.365
Okay, well, you are a douche, but...

51:02.465 --> 51:04.638
it's just so convenient
you came with Aunt Jean.

51:04.738 --> 51:08.866
You know, opportunity's knock
and whatnot, so.

51:34.601 --> 51:36.427
Fuck.

51:40.539 --> 51:43.668
- Wait...
- What the fuck's happening?

51:45.044 --> 51:47.001
Wait.

51:47.797 --> 51:49.704
Guys!

51:57.791 --> 51:59.559
Guys?

51:59.659 --> 52:03.930
If you jump out at me and scare me
I will pepper spray both of you.

52:05.999 --> 52:07.825
Guys?

52:40.466 --> 52:42.760
Hi, pops.

52:46.473 --> 52:50.445
I swear to God, guys, one more time
and I'm gonna kill you.

52:53.146 --> 52:55.582
Jesus Christ, Cameron!
Are you trying to give me a heart attack?

52:55.682 --> 52:59.510
Ma. Ma.

53:00.253 --> 53:02.113
Ma!

53:08.845 --> 53:11.149
Cameron, stop!

53:44.030 --> 53:45.990
Randy.

54:30.777 --> 54:33.238
Help!

54:48.995 --> 54:52.566
- Hey.
- Aunt Jean's dead.

54:52.666 --> 54:56.369
- <i>Caitlin, I can't do this alone.</i>
- You're not alone, you're not.

54:56.469 --> 54:58.805
Randy's tied up in the cellar.

54:58.905 --> 55:01.365
W... what?

55:01.778 --> 55:04.118
It didn't work.

55:04.543 --> 55:07.947
She didn't take him. I should start
figuring out how to do Uncle Joey.

55:08.047 --> 55:12.309
Don't do anything else, all right,
just wait until I get there.

55:14.721 --> 55:17.439
I gotta meet with my parole officer,
though, real quick,

55:17.539 --> 55:21.861
so let me do that, and I...
and then I'll come.

55:21.961 --> 55:24.021
All right?

55:48.454 --> 55:51.015
You're tired, Gramps, aren't you?

55:52.992 --> 55:55.219
You'll be with Nanny.

55:59.766 --> 56:01.526
You'll be happier.

56:03.569 --> 56:05.604
Jesus, what am I doing.

56:05.704 --> 56:08.499
You're doing what's necessary
to save Angie.

56:09.108 --> 56:12.812
Your guilt is the only thing
that's stopping you from saving her!

56:12.912 --> 56:15.348
He'll understand, you know.

56:15.448 --> 56:18.852
This shitty life he has is no life at all.

56:18.952 --> 56:21.120
- I... I can't.
- You have to.

56:21.220 --> 56:25.859
That's easy for you to say. You don't have
to choose six people over one little girl.

56:25.959 --> 56:29.862
Don't ever tell me what I would
or would not do to save my Rebeca.

56:29.962 --> 56:32.732
Lilith is a devil's whore!

56:32.832 --> 56:37.236
And you're a fool. A fool who's squandering
the only chance you're ever gonna get.

56:37.336 --> 56:41.778
There is no good option here.
Even God knows what you have to do.

56:42.108 --> 56:45.111
Your life is as you know it is over.

56:45.211 --> 56:47.647
There's no going back.

56:47.747 --> 56:52.201
So snap out of it, grow some balls
and do what you have to do.

56:52.301 --> 56:53.770
Look...

56:53.870 --> 56:56.172
I know he's old.

56:56.272 --> 57:00.053
And sick, and he probably doesn't
have much time left, but...

57:00.153 --> 57:02.619
he's still a good ma...

57:05.965 --> 57:08.192
a good man.

57:14.340 --> 57:16.433
Wake up.

57:20.046 --> 57:22.716
Don't bother screaming, nobody's here.

57:23.016 --> 57:26.619
Here, I bought you this,
it's a protein shake. Drink up.

57:26.719 --> 57:29.379
- Fuck you.
- Drink.

57:33.692 --> 57:37.130
Look, man. What you saw upstairs
was a demon taking your mom.

57:37.230 --> 57:41.768
And I know you won't be able to understand
this, but, I had to do it to save Angie.

57:41.868 --> 57:46.673
No, man, I totally understand.
If you let me go I can help.

57:46.773 --> 57:48.775
Sorry, I can't do that.

57:48.875 --> 57:53.499
Come on, Cam, I'm getting dizzy over here,
I feel fuzzy, I think I need to see a doctor.

57:53.599 --> 57:54.914
Well, I can't.

57:55.014 --> 57:57.950
People are gonna come
looking for me, you crazy fuck!

57:58.050 --> 58:01.287
All right, and my mom, she's important,
she's got stuff going on like every minute.

58:01.387 --> 58:04.157
You don't think people are gonna notice?

58:04.257 --> 58:06.817
You never shut up, do you?

58:38.157 --> 58:40.889
Angie, Angie, you're up?

59:01.280 --> 59:03.173
Angie.

59:07.887 --> 59:09.800
Angie, what are you doing?

59:24.720 --> 59:26.580
Angie.

59:29.909 --> 59:33.747
Angie, Angie. Oh, my God, oh...

59:33.847 --> 59:37.905
Are you okay? Come on, come on, come on.

01:00:23.930 --> 01:00:26.765
Oh, I didn't know you were home.

01:00:26.865 --> 01:00:29.026
How is she doing?

01:00:30.736 --> 01:00:33.996
- Better.
- Good.

01:00:37.243 --> 01:00:40.330
- Can I go see her?
- You know, I just put her to bed, so,

01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:43.149
you probably shouldn't just wake her up.

01:00:43.249 --> 01:00:44.938
Okay.

01:00:45.038 --> 01:00:47.420
I'll go check on Grandpa.

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:49.514
I didn't think you cared.

01:00:51.790 --> 01:00:55.228
Well, that much I mean.

01:00:55.378 --> 01:00:59.248
Well, with your mom and granny
out of town, he's probably pretty lonely.

01:00:59.348 --> 01:01:01.968
Well, Nanny will be back
from Aunt Jean's tomorrow.

01:01:02.068 --> 01:01:06.339
That's funny, I called Aunt Jean. Nothing.

01:01:06.439 --> 01:01:08.474
You know Aunt Jean.

01:01:08.574 --> 01:01:12.947
Yeah, she's a wasp-y bitch, isn't she?

01:01:15.414 --> 01:01:20.224
- Are you good?
- Ah, bet gone bad.

01:01:21.219 --> 01:01:23.948
- Looks like it.
- Yeah.

01:01:24.323 --> 01:01:27.593
It helped me put things
in perspective, though.

01:01:27.693 --> 01:01:30.370
You know, I care about you, right, Cam?

01:01:30.496 --> 01:01:33.323
You're family, it means something.

01:01:33.899 --> 01:01:37.327
- I just wanted you to know that.
- Yeah.

01:01:59.125 --> 01:02:02.328
- Grandma Mollie?
- Yes.

01:02:02.728 --> 01:02:05.620
This is insane, we can't just
page through our family photo albums

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:08.501
and figure out who should die.

01:02:08.601 --> 01:02:11.695
Okay, well, that's exactly
what we're doing.

01:02:13.873 --> 01:02:16.434
- And what about Granddad?
- Okay, look...

01:02:16.534 --> 01:02:20.079
Granddad is gonna be a natural choice.
But he has to go after Uncle Joey.

01:02:20.179 --> 01:02:22.081
Or else Uncle Joey is gonna
be way too suspicious,

01:02:22.181 --> 01:02:24.651
and I'm running out of excuses
on why people aren't around anymore.

01:02:24.751 --> 01:02:26.868
I really don't think you need
to worry about Uncle Joey,

01:02:26.968 --> 01:02:28.965
I don't think he's gonna notice or care.

01:02:29.065 --> 01:02:32.625
That's the thing. I don't know
what's been going on lately...

01:02:32.725 --> 01:02:35.394
but he's a lot more...

01:02:35.494 --> 01:02:39.367
I don't know, like human than before.
Which is kinda messed up because...

01:02:39.467 --> 01:02:43.302
it sure would be a lot easier if I still
thought he was a useless asshole.

01:02:43.402 --> 01:02:45.856
Okay, so...

01:02:46.164 --> 01:02:50.126
we choose douchebag Uncle Joey,
and Granddad, that's four though.

01:02:50.226 --> 01:02:53.966
Make a suggestion, okay,
that's exactly what we're doing,

01:02:54.066 --> 01:02:58.752
we judge, and then we get to pick
who lives and who dies to save Angie.

01:02:59.352 --> 01:03:03.121
What about Dad? He has a new life,
and new children, and shit.

01:03:03.221 --> 01:03:05.191
Okay, yeah, Dad's already on the list,

01:03:05.291 --> 01:03:07.580
but he's out of town,
and I don't have time to track him down.

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:09.996
Okay, what about his kids?
They're blood related to Angie.

01:03:10.096 --> 01:03:12.522
Caitlin, I'm not...

01:03:12.831 --> 01:03:17.227
I'm not killing kids. There's no way.

01:03:25.544 --> 01:03:27.872
Then who are the last two, Cameron?

01:03:59.011 --> 01:04:01.471
I think we got a problem.

01:04:31.109 --> 01:04:33.246
Holy shit, Randy?

01:04:33.346 --> 01:04:35.839
What the hell, man?

01:04:36.715 --> 01:04:40.819
He thinks that Angie is gonna
be taken by some demon.

01:04:40.919 --> 01:04:43.889
He killed Mom. He tried to kill me.

01:04:43.989 --> 01:04:46.992
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Get me out!

01:04:47.092 --> 01:04:49.362
Ca... Cameron...

01:04:49.462 --> 01:04:51.355
Randy!

01:04:52.365 --> 01:04:54.295
Hey!

01:05:08.447 --> 01:05:10.407
Hey, asshole!

01:05:16.021 --> 01:05:17.956
- What happened?
- Stay back!

01:05:21.089 --> 01:05:24.274
What did you do? Oh, my God!

01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:26.323
Why?

01:05:27.433 --> 01:05:29.993
You cocksucker!

01:05:31.637 --> 01:05:33.180
Cameron!

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:38.695
- Stop!
- Cameron! You're gonna die!

01:05:51.556 --> 01:05:54.418
Come here, cocksucker!

01:05:57.663 --> 01:06:00.009
I'm gonna kill you!

01:06:05.538 --> 01:06:07.364
Cameron!

01:06:09.874 --> 01:06:13.102
Oh, my God! Shit!

01:06:16.949 --> 01:06:18.542
Come here!

01:06:21.286 --> 01:06:24.389
- Cameron!
- Over here, dumbass!

01:06:25.391 --> 01:06:27.294
Cameron!

01:06:28.994 --> 01:06:30.891
Cameron!

01:06:43.942 --> 01:06:47.346
Cameron? Answer me! Cameron!

01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:03.962
Cameron!

01:07:04.262 --> 01:07:06.090
Hey!

01:07:10.169 --> 01:07:13.430
- Over here, Caitlin.
- Are you okay?

01:07:36.329 --> 01:07:38.816
- Let me go!
- Shut up!

01:07:38.916 --> 01:07:41.867
We can't just leave him tied up down here.

01:07:41.967 --> 01:07:45.951
- Okay, well, we are until this is all over.
- He almost got away already.

01:07:48.941 --> 01:07:51.368
I deserved that.

01:07:53.311 --> 01:07:55.648
Cameron, I have a really
big problem with this.

01:07:55.748 --> 01:07:59.084
Caitlin, I'm doing what I have to do
to save your daughter.

01:07:59.184 --> 01:08:01.578
So shut up!

01:08:01.854 --> 01:08:04.723
Cameron, honey, I'm home!

01:08:04.823 --> 01:08:07.426
- Shut up, just shut up.
- Hello?

01:08:07.526 --> 01:08:11.121
- Shit.
- Where is everybody, Mom?

01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:15.125
Hello? Joey?

01:08:15.968 --> 01:08:17.827
Great.

01:08:21.305 --> 01:08:22.251
- Mom.
- Hey.

01:08:22.350 --> 01:08:24.856
- You're home early.
- Wait, what is this. You're bleeding!

01:08:24.956 --> 01:08:26.511
- I'm fine.
- No, you're not fine.

01:08:26.612 --> 01:08:30.174
- No, come here! Come here!
- What are you doing, let me go!

01:08:31.082 --> 01:08:34.647
Cameron, what?
Honey, what's the matter? What's wrong?

01:08:34.886 --> 01:08:38.665
If you had to choose between
Angie and Caitlin,

01:08:38.765 --> 01:08:41.727
one of 'em had to die,
who would you choose?

01:08:41.827 --> 01:08:45.805
- What kind of question is that?
- Mom, answer me.

01:08:54.038 --> 01:08:55.865
Caitlin.

01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:10.913
Hi.

01:09:11.624 --> 01:09:13.133
Hi.

01:09:31.376 --> 01:09:33.337
Is there something wrong with Angie?

01:09:34.345 --> 01:09:37.783
This sounds crazy, Cameron.
I don't understand any of this.

01:09:37.883 --> 01:09:40.719
What's going on? Where's Nanny?
Where's Uncle Joey?

01:09:40.819 --> 01:09:43.008
What have you been doing?
What's happening.

01:09:43.108 --> 01:09:46.850
Mom, listen to me. There's no time!

01:09:48.143 --> 01:09:51.026
I made some awful choices,
but it's because I had to.

01:09:51.126 --> 01:09:54.466
- This is all to save Angie.
- Wait, what choices are you talking about?

01:09:54.566 --> 01:09:57.369
What have you done?
Save Angie from what, Cameron?

01:09:57.469 --> 01:10:01.074
- Come here. Come on!
- Ow, Cameron, Cameron, let go of me!

01:10:01.174 --> 01:10:03.673
If you think none of this is true,
and I'm crazy,

01:10:03.773 --> 01:10:06.779
there should be no problem
with Grandad seeing Angie, right?

01:10:06.879 --> 01:10:09.347
- What is he doing? What've you been doing?
- Calm down, calm down.

01:10:09.447 --> 01:10:14.089
What are you doing? Stop it!
Cameron, what are you doing? Stop it!

01:10:14.189 --> 01:10:17.710
- What have you done? Oh, my God!
- Angie needs you, hold her!

01:10:17.810 --> 01:10:20.326
No! Let go of me! What are you doing?

01:10:20.426 --> 01:10:24.662
- Calm down!
- Let go of me, no! Stop!

01:10:25.964 --> 01:10:28.033
Save her!

01:10:31.303 --> 01:10:33.330
Daddy!

01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:05.821
The devil has come to this house.
This is my fault.

01:11:05.921 --> 01:11:10.450
I knew that I'd be called to the gates
of hell one day for what I did.

01:11:11.476 --> 01:11:13.195
What are you talking about?

01:11:13.295 --> 01:11:17.774
When the twins were born Jamie came out
with all those problems, he was so sick.

01:11:19.117 --> 01:11:25.148
If he had lived, it would've been
a life of... illness and hospitals.

01:11:26.524 --> 01:11:28.226
Mom.

01:11:28.326 --> 01:11:30.954
He went so peacefully.

01:11:31.363 --> 01:11:34.053
What did you do to Jamie?

01:11:34.432 --> 01:11:39.163
I took his frail life away
with these evil hands.

01:11:39.905 --> 01:11:43.141
- You killed my baby?
- Oh, my God Caitlin, I'm so sorry.

01:11:43.241 --> 01:11:46.745
Get away from me. Get away from me!

01:11:46.845 --> 01:11:51.228
For three years you've had Angie
because I was called an unfit mother.

01:11:52.417 --> 01:11:56.354
You don't understand, you were getting
so high when you were pregnant, and...

01:11:56.454 --> 01:11:59.263
And you kicked me out of my home,
and you wouldn't call me,

01:11:59.363 --> 01:12:02.761
you took my children,
and you killed my Jamie!

01:12:02.861 --> 01:12:07.279
You... you know, you say that you love God
and you preach all this bullshit,

01:12:07.379 --> 01:12:10.664
but you're just a murderer,
you self-righteous bitch!

01:12:17.810 --> 01:12:21.413
I made the wrong choice, I'm so sorry.

01:12:21.513 --> 01:12:23.866
That wasn't your choice to make.

01:12:23.966 --> 01:12:27.785
- Caitlin, I'm sorry. Caitlin!
- No.

01:13:32.250 --> 01:13:37.455
Wild cats and hyenas will meet there,
and billy goats called to each other,

01:13:37.555 --> 01:13:42.521
Lilith the night monster will lurk there
and find herself a place to rest.

01:13:43.261 --> 01:13:46.856
Oh, Angie! Angie, stop!

01:13:47.565 --> 01:13:49.830
Angie, no!

01:14:27.773 --> 01:14:29.899
Nanny gave this to me.

01:14:32.177 --> 01:14:34.341
I want you to have it.

01:14:37.349 --> 01:14:39.175
Caitlin.

01:14:40.452 --> 01:14:43.594
I know there's no way
you're ever gonna forgive me,

01:14:43.694 --> 01:14:48.160
and I, Lord knows there's nothing
I can do to make it right, but...

01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:51.217
there's something I can do for Angie.

01:14:54.332 --> 01:14:56.138
Mom.

01:14:56.238 --> 01:14:58.165
There's one more thing.

01:14:59.104 --> 01:15:00.697
What?

01:15:01.306 --> 01:15:04.647
- Randy's tied up in the cellar.
- What, why?

01:15:04.977 --> 01:15:07.624
I tried the symbol on him, it didn't work.

01:15:08.346 --> 01:15:11.395
Cam, baby, Randy's adopted.

01:15:16.754 --> 01:15:19.648
Oh, shit, stay here.

01:15:35.824 --> 01:15:38.310
Oh, shit!

01:15:50.405 --> 01:15:54.431
Guys, guys, we gotta go.
We gotta go right now.

01:16:14.379 --> 01:16:17.515
You promise me you'll finish
what you started, okay?

01:16:17.615 --> 01:16:20.853
- Promise!
- I promise, Mom.

01:16:20.953 --> 01:16:23.784
I love you so much, Cameron.

01:16:31.463 --> 01:16:34.066
I want you to know I always loved you.

01:16:34.166 --> 01:16:36.730
Take care of Angie.

01:16:38.203 --> 01:16:40.614
Okay, I'm ready, I'm ready.

01:16:42.407 --> 01:16:45.534
Oh, God. Oh, my...

01:17:50.742 --> 01:17:52.469
We have our last sacrifice.

01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:04.857
- Hi, Caitlin.
- Hey.

01:18:04.957 --> 01:18:06.992
- Come in.
- Where's Cameron?

01:18:07.092 --> 01:18:09.185
Over here.

01:18:12.864 --> 01:18:15.424
Oh, my God, Angie.

01:18:17.635 --> 01:18:19.788
Cam, what happened to you?

01:18:19.888 --> 01:18:23.582
- I need something from you.
- What's going on?

01:18:34.319 --> 01:18:37.790
You were right. I wanna be a good father.

01:18:37.890 --> 01:18:39.324
And I don't wanna keep this baby.

01:18:39.624 --> 01:18:41.760
- What are you doing?
- Shh, it's okay.

01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:45.367
Cam, you're scare... what, Caitlin?
What the fuck, guys?

01:18:45.467 --> 01:18:47.665
- Sit down, just sit down.
- Cameron, get her off of me!

01:18:47.765 --> 01:18:49.534
- Do it!
- What the hell is going on?

01:18:49.634 --> 01:18:52.604
- Let me go!
- Hold still!

01:18:52.704 --> 01:18:58.107
Caitlin, get off of me!
Let me go, please let me go!

01:19:06.784 --> 01:19:09.221
- What the fuck is happening?
- This isn't my baby, is it?

01:19:09.321 --> 01:19:10.798
Come on, honey,

01:19:10.898 --> 01:19:13.659
- let's just talk about it, okay?
- Shut up, okay? Shut the fuck up.

01:19:13.759 --> 01:19:15.627
- Just tell me what's going on.
- Shut the fuck up!

01:19:15.728 --> 01:19:18.955
How long have you been fucking
someone on the side, Megan?

01:19:19.064 --> 01:19:22.267
Alright, that's it, get out of here.
Go. Get out of here.

01:19:22.367 --> 01:19:27.538
- You guys are crazy.
- You have no idea what you've done.

01:19:52.864 --> 01:19:55.133
I promised Mom we'd finish this.

01:19:55.233 --> 01:19:57.326
We are finishing this.

01:19:59.837 --> 01:20:02.540
- So maybe you...
- Should do the same?

01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:07.136
She is your daughter! But you know what?
You were never her mother.

01:20:07.779 --> 01:20:10.375
I am her mother. You're a murderer.

01:20:10.475 --> 01:20:13.987
Well, maybe you should take some
responsibility. She deserves better!

01:20:14.087 --> 01:20:17.821
Oh, I can take care of Angie
better than any murderer!

01:20:21.093 --> 01:20:24.629
- You can't even take care of yourself.
- What are you gonna do for her, huh?

01:20:24.729 --> 01:20:27.065
You're gonna be put away,
what are you gonna do for her?

01:20:27.165 --> 01:20:31.035
They'll find her a decent home.
One with a mom who isn't shooting up.

01:20:31.135 --> 01:20:34.071
No, we might as well
just let her get taken then.

01:20:34.171 --> 01:20:36.716
Because I'm not leaving her with you.

01:20:38.910 --> 01:20:41.170
Baby, come here.

01:20:41.713 --> 01:20:44.049
What makes you think...

01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:46.478
that you deserve to live
and she deserves to die?

01:20:46.818 --> 01:20:50.088
I'm still here,
and I have a right to fight for my life.

01:20:50.188 --> 01:20:52.124
Then fight for it!

01:20:52.224 --> 01:20:54.483
Mommy?

01:20:55.293 --> 01:20:57.153
Angie?

01:20:58.796 --> 01:21:00.656
Honey?

01:21:01.399 --> 01:21:05.500
- Are you okay?
- I don't feel good, Mommy.

01:21:24.122 --> 01:21:26.415
This is the police!

01:21:27.158 --> 01:21:28.693
- Open up!
- Here, come over here.

01:21:28.793 --> 01:21:32.064
Help me draw the symbol on myself.
There is no time, come over here.

01:21:32.164 --> 01:21:34.429
Help me draw the symbol on myself.

01:21:34.529 --> 01:21:37.224
Promise me, promise me, that when
they come you blame it all on me,

01:21:37.324 --> 01:21:40.494
tell him it was all my fault, I just
went crazy, and you don't know where I went,

01:21:40.594 --> 01:21:43.195
tell them I made you do this.
Tell me, promise me, Caitlin.

01:21:43.295 --> 01:21:44.409
I promise.

01:21:44.509 --> 01:21:47.250
This is the police,
what's going on in there?

01:21:59.905 --> 01:22:02.185
Thank you.

01:22:09.601 --> 01:22:11.905
Caitlin, Caitlin, go!

01:22:39.297 --> 01:22:41.524
Leave her alone!

01:22:50.175 --> 01:22:52.726
Let's go to hell, bitch!

01:23:04.289 --> 01:23:06.524
No!

01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:30.639
Angie!

01:23:34.086 --> 01:23:37.346
- Mommy!
- Oh, my God.

01:23:38.656 --> 01:23:41.017
It's gonna be okay.

01:23:41.526 --> 01:23:44.255
Okay, okay.

01:23:55.207 --> 01:23:59.541
Come on, Angie, we gotta get going,
the movers are gonna be here any second.

01:24:06.183 --> 01:24:08.577
Ready to go, sweetie?

01:24:15.827 --> 01:24:19.261
Let's go, huh? Come on.

01:25:22.143 --> 01:25:25.179
<i># Oh, this the realest shit I ever wrote</i>

01:25:25.279 --> 01:25:27.465
<i># No, I'm playing but my eyes
are getting hella low</i>

01:25:27.565 --> 01:25:29.917

life has been incredible</i>

01:25:30.017 --> 01:25:32.420
<i># Traveling around the country
doing things unforgettable</i>

01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:34.922
<i># When it comes down to it,
shit, I'm still a kid</i>

01:25:35.022 --> 01:25:37.642
<i># Younger brother, older sister,
I was just the middle kid</i>

01:25:37.742 --> 01:25:39.877
<i># The middle child,
but I had a little style</i>

01:25:39.977 --> 01:25:42.906
<i># My friends told me I had
something special, so I spit a while</i>

01:25:43.006 --> 01:25:47.185
<i># I spit a couple of verses for my fans
I spit a couple of verses for my fans</i>

01:25:47.285 --> 01:25:49.648
<i># I spit a couple of verses for the ones
that knew for certain,</i>

01:25:49.748 --> 01:25:52.324
<i># And if I continue working
the dream will become real</i>

01:25:52.424 --> 01:25:57.429
<i># It never seems real till it hits home
And I been on the road so I been gone</i>

01:25:57.529 --> 01:25:59.677
<i># I remember coming home from school
and getting lifted</i>

01:25:59.777 --> 01:26:03.400
<i>While I search the Internet
for any piece that I could spit, uh</i>

01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:08.505
<i># I don't know what's happening
But I don't know what's wrong</i>

01:26:08.605 --> 01:26:13.377
