00:08.704 --> 00:10.401
<i>Previously on "Chapelwaite"...</i>

00:10.532 --> 00:12.621
<i>
Stay away from Stephen Boone.</i>

00:12.751 --> 00:13.665
<i>He means you harm.</i>

00:13.796 --> 00:14.884
Could he do
any worse than this?

00:16.277 --> 00:18.018
It appears this Jakub
contacted Father

00:18.148 --> 00:19.671
in regards to a book:

00:19.802 --> 00:23.197
<i>De Vermis Mysteriis.
Mysteries of the Worm.</i>

00:23.327 --> 00:24.850
<i>Enough is enough.</i>

00:24.981 --> 00:27.157
<i>No story worth
putting your life in jeopardy. </i>

00:27.288 --> 00:29.072
Read for yourself.

00:29.203 --> 00:30.682
<i>It's Rebecca's writings.</i>

00:30.813 --> 00:33.033
<i>She thinks we're cursed
and Father's mad. </i>

00:33.163 --> 00:34.512
Is it your child?

00:34.643 --> 00:36.166
It is.

00:36.297 --> 00:38.386
<i>Put aside everything
you thought you knew. </i>

00:38.516 --> 00:40.649
Jakub and his kind are undead.

00:40.779 --> 00:42.390
I don't believe you.

00:42.520 --> 00:44.174
How can you not believe these?

00:44.305 --> 00:46.611
<i>The lack of bruising
around the punctures, </i>

00:46.742 --> 00:49.092
<i>I'd almost say that
they were bites of some sort. </i>

00:49.223 --> 00:50.659
<i>But not human.</i>

00:50.789 --> 00:52.400
<i>
I know of Jerusalem's Lot.</i>

00:52.530 --> 00:54.445
<i>It was my great-grandfather's
mining town. </i>

00:54.576 --> 00:56.578
<i>People tell stories
about James Boone </i>

00:56.708 --> 00:57.840
and those
who used to live there,

00:57.970 --> 00:59.320
mostly to scare the kids.

00:59.450 --> 01:00.886
I thought it was abandoned.

01:01.017 --> 01:02.671
- Come on!
- She's upstairs!

01:02.801 --> 01:04.890
There's no greater
sorrow for a parent

01:05.021 --> 01:06.501
than to lose a child.

01:06.631 --> 01:07.371
Loa?

01:10.766 --> 01:12.072
Loa!

01:12.202 --> 01:14.030
He'll see you now.

01:14.161 --> 01:16.685
You harm them and I swear
you'll never see that book.

01:16.815 --> 01:18.339
Oh, whaler.

01:18.469 --> 01:21.472
What mercy
did you show Leviathan?

01:22.778 --> 01:24.214
- No!

01:42.450 --> 01:44.147
Thy rod and Thy staff,
they comfort me.

01:44.278 --> 01:45.453
Thou preparest a table
before me

01:45.583 --> 01:46.410
in the presence of
mine enemies--

01:46.541 --> 01:47.498
Marcella!

01:47.629 --> 01:48.325
Yea, though I walk
through the valley

01:48.456 --> 01:49.892
of the shadow of death,

01:50.022 --> 01:51.720
I will fear no evil
for thou art with me.

01:53.635 --> 01:56.507
- Marcella! Where are you?!

01:58.770 --> 02:00.294
Marcella!

02:43.554 --> 02:45.513
Marcella.

02:46.601 --> 02:47.906
- Grandfather's angry.

02:50.779 --> 02:53.651
Tell us where you hid the book
and I can keep you safe.

02:55.087 --> 02:57.264
Don't run from me, child.
I'm your father.

02:57.394 --> 02:58.917
You're a monster!

03:07.230 --> 03:07.883
- Grandfather!

03:23.290 --> 03:25.814
Where is the book?

03:25.944 --> 03:28.208
- Stop!

03:28.338 --> 03:29.513
Father, that's enough.

03:45.921 --> 03:47.488
Stay away!

03:47.618 --> 03:50.752
Tell me where you hid it.
All will be forgiven.

03:55.931 --> 03:59.369
Tell us, or I will bleed
the truth from you.

04:03.982 --> 04:06.289
- Marcella!

04:16.865 --> 04:19.215
No! No...

04:19.346 --> 04:20.434
No.

04:21.565 --> 04:24.438
Save your tears for Jakub.

04:24.568 --> 04:26.266
You can beg his forgiveness.

06:55.502 --> 06:57.678
Honor!

06:57.808 --> 06:58.983
Honor!

07:02.944 --> 07:04.032
No!

07:04.162 --> 07:05.512
Oh, my God.

07:05.642 --> 07:08.863
No, no,
no, no, no, no!

07:08.993 --> 07:11.126
Father,
what's happened?!

07:50.992 --> 07:53.211
Father? Father!

07:55.953 --> 07:57.564
Father?

07:57.694 --> 07:59.261
Open the door!

07:59.391 --> 08:01.219
Father,
what's wrong with Loa?

08:57.798 --> 08:59.190
You can't just
lock her up like that.

08:59.321 --> 09:01.366
That's your wife.
What, have you lost all sense?

09:01.497 --> 09:03.238
Perhaps.

09:03.368 --> 09:05.022
But I know who I fought.

09:06.633 --> 09:08.330
Even if
Phillip Boone is alive...

09:08.460 --> 09:10.724
I'm not so sure he was.

09:13.727 --> 09:16.686
Surely you don't
believe this?

09:16.817 --> 09:18.383
Logically, no.

09:18.514 --> 09:20.690
But Mary
does have irregular wounds

09:20.821 --> 09:22.649
hidden beneath her hair.
I found the same marks

09:22.779 --> 09:24.389
on William Albright
and Francis Blair.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.783
- You said they were bites.
- I said they could be.

09:26.914 --> 09:29.873
Faith Pringle
spoke of bites.

09:30.004 --> 09:32.746
She has scars on her body.

09:32.876 --> 09:35.052
Did she say what from?

09:35.183 --> 09:37.185
People.

09:37.315 --> 09:40.275
From Jerusalem's Lot.
She said they...

09:40.405 --> 09:41.668
they drank her blood.

09:41.798 --> 09:43.452
- How many people?
- I don't know.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.673
I didn't believe her.
I thought she was delusional.

09:46.803 --> 09:50.024
Martin, will you watch Mary
for an hour?

09:51.242 --> 09:52.809
Let no one near her.

09:52.940 --> 09:54.376
We need to speak
with Elizabeth Cloris.

09:54.506 --> 09:56.683
George...

09:56.813 --> 09:58.293
Why me?

09:58.423 --> 10:00.774
If Phillip Boone is alive
and comes back,

10:00.904 --> 10:03.211
I'm not much of a fighter.

10:03.341 --> 10:05.909
Fighting didn't
chase him off last night.

10:11.436 --> 10:13.221
This did.

10:28.192 --> 10:29.933
Father will come.

10:31.282 --> 10:33.023
He will tell us what happened.

10:34.808 --> 10:37.288
It's okay, Tane. Don't cry.

10:37.419 --> 10:39.116
It's okay, Tane.

10:48.604 --> 10:50.824
Father, is she really...

10:53.217 --> 10:54.784
She is.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.965
- Tane. Come.

11:07.841 --> 11:09.756
We'll clean her.

11:11.322 --> 11:13.847
And we'll choose
her favorite dress.

11:32.343 --> 11:34.084
Charles.

11:36.652 --> 11:38.436
She's gone.

11:42.832 --> 11:44.399
What happened?

11:48.664 --> 11:50.753
We went to the boarding house
as planned.

11:51.841 --> 11:53.538
I put them to bed.

11:53.669 --> 11:55.062
All together.

11:55.192 --> 11:57.151
But when I went to check
on them, Loa was gone.

11:58.805 --> 12:02.199
I suspected she'd come here,
and we rode straight away.

12:03.853 --> 12:05.246
When was that?

12:08.162 --> 12:10.120
Shortly after midnight.

12:12.253 --> 12:14.472
When we arrived,
the door was wide open.

12:28.922 --> 12:31.054
We searched every room,

12:31.185 --> 12:34.405
every hidden passageway
in this terrible house.

12:41.238 --> 12:44.807
You entrusted me with
the safety of your children,

12:46.026 --> 12:47.375
and I failed.

12:50.030 --> 12:52.162
I'll never forgive myself.

12:57.559 --> 13:00.083
I saw Loa with Stephen.

13:01.519 --> 13:04.435
I knew she was in danger.

13:04.566 --> 13:07.569
You rode to Jerusalem's Lot
for your family.

13:07.699 --> 13:09.310
You had to go.

13:11.399 --> 13:14.054
I met with him...

13:14.184 --> 13:15.490
Jakub.

13:20.190 --> 13:22.192
He calls himself "vampire."

13:24.542 --> 13:26.457
Stephen and Phillip
are the same.

13:28.111 --> 13:29.852
What does that mean?

13:29.983 --> 13:31.375
Undead.

13:33.900 --> 13:36.467
The wounds
on my daughter are bites.

13:40.254 --> 13:42.343
They drank her blood.

13:44.519 --> 13:46.129
No...

13:47.957 --> 13:49.524
That's what they do.

13:51.961 --> 13:54.442
They'll use
my children to get to me.

14:02.580 --> 14:03.973
Tell me everything.

14:06.584 --> 14:07.890
Now!

14:09.587 --> 14:11.981
I can only tell you
what I know.

14:12.112 --> 14:14.157
Phillip and Stephen started
spending time

14:14.288 --> 14:15.985
in Jerusalem's Lot.

14:17.204 --> 14:19.162
I rarely saw them.

14:20.294 --> 14:22.339
And never during the day.

14:25.125 --> 14:26.474
One afternoon...

14:28.041 --> 14:29.477
the house was so quiet,

14:30.695 --> 14:32.175
I presumed they'd left.

14:33.307 --> 14:35.700
I went into Phillip's room,

14:35.831 --> 14:37.180
and I found them...

14:38.790 --> 14:39.574
dead.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.579
I was stunned. I couldn't...

14:44.709 --> 14:47.147
fathom what had happened.

14:48.409 --> 14:51.194
Marcella said
they were sleeping.

14:53.109 --> 14:56.547
I assumed she was distraught.
Confused.

14:56.678 --> 14:59.594
I brought the child
home with me.

14:59.724 --> 15:01.988
I... put her to bed.

15:02.118 --> 15:05.905
And I was on my way
to see you when...

15:08.255 --> 15:12.607
Phillip Boone...
came to my door,

15:13.869 --> 15:15.523
very much alive.

15:18.134 --> 15:20.354
He said that
I must return to work...

15:22.008 --> 15:24.924
and never speak of
what I'd seen.

15:26.751 --> 15:28.231
Or...

15:30.668 --> 15:35.456
...he would bleed the life
out of me and Marcella.

15:38.459 --> 15:40.591
That's when I knew
they'd become something...

15:41.810 --> 15:45.379
truly unholy.

15:47.555 --> 15:49.644
You must keep Phillip Boone
away from Mary.

15:49.774 --> 15:52.473
I've tried everything.

15:52.603 --> 15:54.779
I can't stop him.

15:54.910 --> 15:58.653
If Phillip is feeding,
he'll do so until Mary dies.

15:58.783 --> 16:00.960
But if she has fed on him,

16:02.526 --> 16:04.615
- she'll join him.
- Join him how?

16:06.966 --> 16:08.532
She'll live for eternity.

16:10.273 --> 16:12.232
A creature of the night.

16:12.362 --> 16:15.278
Hunting humans
and feasting on their blood.

16:15.409 --> 16:18.716
So, if she has fed...

16:22.329 --> 16:24.679
Then she is
no longer your wife.

16:29.336 --> 16:31.251
I've heard enough.

16:46.788 --> 16:48.485
You knew all this...

16:50.009 --> 16:51.836
...and you let Charles Boone

16:51.967 --> 16:54.622
and those three children
move into that house?

17:00.410 --> 17:03.065
- And I am damned for doing so.

17:09.985 --> 17:11.204
Minister?

17:15.904 --> 17:17.340
Where's George?

17:19.603 --> 17:21.257
He went to town on an errand.

17:21.388 --> 17:23.477
But he'll be back soon.

17:26.219 --> 17:29.613
I'm thirsty.
May I have water?

17:29.744 --> 17:31.050
Of course.

17:43.366 --> 17:45.325
Can you bring it to me?

17:47.196 --> 17:48.632
I don't have a key.

17:57.337 --> 17:59.208
I have the illness.

18:02.820 --> 18:05.084
That's why
he's locked me in here.

18:05.214 --> 18:07.086
George fears me.

18:07.216 --> 18:10.089
I'm sure he's just trying to do
what's best for you.

18:16.356 --> 18:17.661
I'm dying.

18:19.315 --> 18:20.664
Like all the others.

18:20.795 --> 18:22.492
We don't know that.

18:24.190 --> 18:26.844
You've gotta remain strong
in your faith, Mary.

18:29.238 --> 18:30.544
Would you like to pray?

18:33.068 --> 18:34.374
I would.

18:46.690 --> 18:48.823
All power and glory is Yours,
Lord our God,

18:48.953 --> 18:51.260
for You have called us
to serve You in love.

18:51.391 --> 18:53.784
Bless Mary, so that she may
be able to bear this illness

18:53.915 --> 18:57.614
in union with Your Son's
obedient suffering.

18:57.745 --> 19:00.965
Restore her to health,
and deliver her to glory.

19:01.096 --> 19:02.619
Amen.

19:10.410 --> 19:12.542
I've been a good servant
to God, haven't I?

19:14.588 --> 19:16.155
There are none better.

19:17.417 --> 19:20.289
And will He welcome me
into His kingdom when I die?

19:21.290 --> 19:23.074
If death comes,

19:24.250 --> 19:27.557
I am certain that He Himself
will be your shepherd.

19:30.125 --> 19:31.561
He speaks to me.

19:33.998 --> 19:35.174
Who does?

19:40.570 --> 19:41.789
God.

19:44.922 --> 19:46.359
And what does he say?

19:46.489 --> 19:48.404
He offers me His blood

19:48.535 --> 19:50.493
so I will live forever.

19:54.454 --> 19:55.803
In the dark.

21:10.399 --> 21:12.271
I'm so sorry.

21:19.190 --> 21:20.757
I love you.

22:30.784 --> 22:32.786
<i>
There are those who live...</i>

22:35.876 --> 22:38.618
<i>...and those who feed
off that living. </i>

22:40.881 --> 22:42.665
<i>The latter are cowards.</i>

22:47.409 --> 22:49.803
<i>They find comfort and safety</i>

22:49.933 --> 22:52.849
<i>living in the background,
the shadows. </i>

22:56.766 --> 22:59.856
<i>Am I so different
from these vampires? </i>

23:29.146 --> 23:31.018
I want to say

23:31.148 --> 23:34.151
how sorry I am for
writing the story.

23:34.282 --> 23:36.545
Why did you lie?

23:36.676 --> 23:38.721
I have a job

23:38.852 --> 23:42.508
to write for a very
prestigious magazine.

23:42.638 --> 23:44.814
It's something I've wanted
my whole life.

23:46.033 --> 23:48.557
But I lost confidence
in myself.

23:50.820 --> 23:53.606
I didn't think
that I had the talent

23:53.736 --> 23:56.913
to create a story
worthy of this publication.

23:58.393 --> 24:00.177
So I took yours.

24:02.179 --> 24:03.877
And that was wrong.

24:05.661 --> 24:07.141
You hurt us.

24:07.271 --> 24:08.490
I know.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.712
I made a terrible mistake.

24:13.930 --> 24:15.976
And I want you to know...

24:17.586 --> 24:20.459
I love you both very much.

24:22.983 --> 24:25.942
And I hope someday
you can forgive me.

25:08.071 --> 25:10.683
- I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
- I started to worry.

25:10.813 --> 25:12.989
Do you have the tickets?

25:14.251 --> 25:16.166
Martin.

25:16.297 --> 25:17.646
What is it?

25:20.083 --> 25:21.171
Only one.

25:22.825 --> 25:24.697
You and Henry are gonna have
to leave without me.

25:26.916 --> 25:28.570
No. Don't do this.

25:30.441 --> 25:32.922
You'd abandon me
and your son?

25:33.053 --> 25:36.230
For... for what?
For Alice?

25:36.360 --> 25:39.363
No.
That's not it.

25:39.494 --> 25:41.540
Something wicked
has taken root

25:41.670 --> 25:42.715
in Preacher's Corners.

25:42.845 --> 25:45.021
You know this already.

25:45.152 --> 25:47.415
You have been trying
to tell me. I know that,

25:47.546 --> 25:48.808
and I didn't listen to you.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.726
They're my congregation,
Faith.

25:55.162 --> 25:58.557
I can't leave them
in their hour of need.

25:59.949 --> 26:01.864
There's nothing
you can do for them.

26:01.995 --> 26:03.562
They're all going to die.

26:04.650 --> 26:06.565
Why?

26:06.695 --> 26:07.957
Is it Phillip Boone?

26:08.088 --> 26:10.569
Phillip Boone means nothing.

26:10.699 --> 26:13.528
I told you, the real evil
is in Jerusalem's Lot.

26:13.659 --> 26:15.617
It's Jakub.

26:15.748 --> 26:18.577
When he comes,
he'll bring the Worm.

26:20.230 --> 26:22.581
I'm told that
Phillip Boone fears the cross.

26:23.712 --> 26:25.235
Does Jakub fear it as well?

26:25.366 --> 26:27.194
Jakub fears nothing.

26:35.376 --> 26:37.117
May I?

26:56.702 --> 26:58.094
I love you, Faith.

26:59.356 --> 27:01.184
And I love our Henry.

27:06.886 --> 27:09.018
That's not enough.

27:16.547 --> 27:19.115
When this is all over...

27:19.246 --> 27:22.902
God willing,
I want to join you out west.

27:33.042 --> 27:35.915
I wish I could convince
you that dying...

27:36.045 --> 27:39.266
is not your penance
to pay for our love.

27:59.112 --> 28:01.636
Our Father, Who art in heaven,
Hallowed be Thy name.

28:01.767 --> 28:03.638
- Thy Kingdom come,

28:03.769 --> 28:04.987
Thy will be done...

28:09.078 --> 28:10.297
Rebecca.

28:13.735 --> 28:15.345
Father would like to see you.

28:31.622 --> 28:33.407
Come in.

28:37.628 --> 28:40.762
The children told me
about your story.

28:47.813 --> 28:49.902
Is it true?

28:50.032 --> 28:51.773
Did you take the job
as governess so that...

28:52.905 --> 28:54.341
you could write about us?

28:54.471 --> 28:55.777
I did.

28:57.344 --> 28:59.476
My ambition
got the better of me.

29:08.877 --> 29:10.749
I opened my home to you.

29:15.666 --> 29:17.364
I spoke to you in confidence.

29:20.584 --> 29:22.282
And I broke that trust.

29:23.849 --> 29:25.807
I'm sorry.

29:30.725 --> 29:33.423
It's almost dark.
It's not safe to travel.

29:33.554 --> 29:36.383
I believe Stephen
and Phillip may be near.

29:36.513 --> 29:39.386
If they're coming for me,
it will be tonight.

29:41.475 --> 29:42.824
Tomorrow,

29:44.260 --> 29:46.523
you'll pack
your things and go.

29:46.654 --> 29:48.438
Of course.
I understand.

29:48.569 --> 29:50.223
Tell me...

29:55.968 --> 30:00.102
Has this tragedy played out
to your satisfaction?

30:15.117 --> 30:16.336
Good day.

30:16.466 --> 30:18.251
- Minister.
- Minister Burroughs.

30:44.755 --> 30:46.148
Alice?

30:57.812 --> 30:59.031
Hello?

31:03.513 --> 31:05.298
- Alice?
- Do not speak to her.

31:06.647 --> 31:08.605
You've lost that privilege.

31:10.738 --> 31:12.871
I gave you my congregation...

31:14.002 --> 31:15.743
and my daughter's hand,

31:15.874 --> 31:17.484
and this is how you repay us?

31:18.789 --> 31:21.096
By bringing shame to our door.

31:21.227 --> 31:23.055
I'm sorry, Samuel.
I will not speak to you

31:23.185 --> 31:24.273
about our personal business.

31:24.404 --> 31:26.885
This is between husband,
wife and God.

31:27.015 --> 31:30.323
God disavowed you

31:30.453 --> 31:32.281
and this town...

31:34.631 --> 31:38.984
...the moment you fornicated
with that street walker.

31:41.029 --> 31:43.989
You have lied before God,

31:44.119 --> 31:46.078
and he has punished
us all for it.

31:47.340 --> 31:49.646
That is not how God works.

31:49.777 --> 31:51.779
The arrogance.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.999
To know the mind of God.

31:54.129 --> 31:56.218
I should drag you out
into the street

31:56.349 --> 31:58.525
and beat you like a dog.

32:00.092 --> 32:02.094
But Alice begged me not to.

32:03.922 --> 32:07.229
Take your belongings and go.

32:13.801 --> 32:15.411
Alice?

32:19.850 --> 32:21.722
I am sorry that I was
not strong enough

32:21.852 --> 32:24.116
to heal this terrible wound
that we share.

33:09.857 --> 33:11.946
Minister Burroughs.

33:12.077 --> 33:14.601
Good afternoon, Ann.

33:14.731 --> 33:17.604
Faith left an hour ago
with her baby.

33:17.734 --> 33:19.127
She was in a rush,

33:19.258 --> 33:20.563
so she hired a coach

33:20.694 --> 33:22.435
to take her
to the train in Cumberland.

33:28.832 --> 33:32.184
I'm not here for Faith.
I'm here for a room.

33:58.732 --> 34:00.342
George.

34:04.651 --> 34:05.782
What's wrong?

34:14.400 --> 34:16.358
I'm sorry
I don't feel well.

34:19.448 --> 34:21.102
I'm sorry, too.

34:24.062 --> 34:25.498
It'll all be over shortly.

34:25.628 --> 34:27.021
No more pain.

34:27.152 --> 34:28.240
I'm not afraid.

34:31.373 --> 34:33.114
Whenever God's ready.

34:35.421 --> 34:37.771
- I love you.
- Hmm...

34:43.907 --> 34:45.735
Why don't you close your eyes
for a little while?

35:00.315 --> 35:02.274
May God forgive me.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.846
I won't let you be like them.

35:16.070 --> 35:18.594
- God have mercy.
- No! No!

35:20.944 --> 35:22.772
Stop. Stop!

35:24.209 --> 35:26.124
No! Stop it!

35:28.517 --> 35:29.866
No!

36:18.350 --> 36:20.308
You're safe now.

36:40.894 --> 36:43.026
Don't slow down.

36:43.157 --> 36:44.680
Please, go around him.

36:50.817 --> 36:52.862
What are you doing?
Don't stop!

36:52.993 --> 36:54.690
He might
need help up there.

36:56.344 --> 36:57.606
Don't.

37:00.218 --> 37:01.741
Is everything all right?

37:05.962 --> 37:07.660
God help us.

37:07.790 --> 37:09.488
You need help?

37:10.750 --> 37:12.230
Run!

37:14.884 --> 37:16.973
- No!

37:25.330 --> 37:28.420
Ah! No! Please!

37:28.550 --> 37:30.073
No! Don't touch him!

37:37.603 --> 37:40.083
Do what you will with me,

37:40.214 --> 37:41.694
but I beg you...

37:41.824 --> 37:44.436
...let my baby live.

37:45.524 --> 37:47.003
Let me see it.

37:48.875 --> 37:50.442
Give it to me.

38:15.380 --> 38:18.252
Faith...

38:18.383 --> 38:21.299
You want this thing to live?

38:25.868 --> 38:28.610
You know how little
Jakub cares for his children.

38:30.960 --> 38:32.919
Please.

39:14.308 --> 39:15.788
No one leaves
this room until dawn.

39:22.142 --> 39:24.057
How can you be sure
Phillip and Stephen

39:24.187 --> 39:25.363
will come tonight?

39:27.930 --> 39:29.628
They left Loa
where I would find her.

39:32.065 --> 39:33.371
It was a message.

39:38.941 --> 39:40.856
They have something to say.

39:48.342 --> 39:49.996
And much to answer for.

41:11.251 --> 41:12.905
George.

41:20.042 --> 41:21.087
Father...

41:22.871 --> 41:25.874
Why do your cousin
and uncle want to hurt us?

41:26.005 --> 41:27.920
'Cause they are sick men.

41:30.662 --> 41:32.577
I won't let them harm you.

41:33.795 --> 41:36.232
They need to suffer
for what they did to Loa.

41:38.278 --> 41:39.497
They will.

41:47.243 --> 41:48.897
- Shh...
- They're here!

41:49.028 --> 41:50.638
Shh!

42:24.280 --> 42:25.717
Who's there?

42:28.328 --> 42:29.851
Stephen?

42:33.507 --> 42:34.943
Father?

42:43.256 --> 42:44.300
I'm cold.

42:45.519 --> 42:46.868
What is happening?

42:48.348 --> 42:49.697
Let me in?

42:51.133 --> 42:52.613
- Please?
- Oh, God!

42:55.964 --> 42:57.618
I'm scared.

43:03.668 --> 43:04.973
Honor?

43:07.976 --> 43:08.890
Tane?

43:10.544 --> 43:11.763
Open the door.

43:11.893 --> 43:13.286
Don't let her in!

43:37.484 --> 43:38.920
Come, Father.

43:49.539 --> 43:51.019
Rebecca.

43:54.066 --> 43:56.198
Stay here.
Lock the door.

44:47.467 --> 44:48.990
Loa?

44:51.427 --> 44:52.690
Loa?

44:54.996 --> 44:56.302
Up here.

45:01.699 --> 45:03.439
What's happened to you?

45:06.442 --> 45:07.835
Look, Father.

45:10.316 --> 45:11.752
No brace.

45:13.188 --> 45:14.886
I don't need it anymore.

45:17.540 --> 45:19.151
I'm free.

45:20.935 --> 45:22.328
Come down here.

45:22.458 --> 45:23.329
No.

45:25.331 --> 45:27.899
You can't tell me
what to do anymore.

45:29.596 --> 45:31.729
I'm with my new family now.

45:31.859 --> 45:33.339
I'm one of them.

45:36.995 --> 45:38.474
Hello, Cousin.

45:42.304 --> 45:43.915
Guns are useless.

45:44.045 --> 45:45.917
You should know that by now.

45:49.921 --> 45:51.444
What have you done to her?

45:53.098 --> 45:55.404
I gave her what you couldn't.

45:55.535 --> 45:57.189
A life with no shame.

45:57.319 --> 45:59.539
You brought this upon yourself.

45:59.669 --> 46:01.497
Did you deal with Jakub?

46:03.064 --> 46:04.718
I've made deals with no one.

46:04.849 --> 46:05.980
Liar.

46:06.111 --> 46:08.069
We've been watching you,
Charles.

46:08.200 --> 46:09.505
We know you hear the book.

46:10.768 --> 46:12.552
Follow its call.

46:12.682 --> 46:14.510
When you find it,
you will quickly learn

46:14.641 --> 46:16.948
that the book is, uh...
demanding.

46:18.297 --> 46:20.690
We can save you from it.
Bring it to us.

46:20.821 --> 46:22.040
What?

46:23.302 --> 46:24.956
Why would I
bring you anything?

46:26.348 --> 46:27.393
Because if you bring
the book to Jakub,

46:27.523 --> 46:29.351
he will kill you.

46:29.482 --> 46:31.049
He has no further
use for you.

46:32.528 --> 46:34.487
You belong with us.

46:34.617 --> 46:36.837
We're your family.

46:36.968 --> 46:38.839
You're not my family!

46:38.970 --> 46:41.929
You lured me here with lies!

46:42.060 --> 46:43.713
You murdered my child!

46:43.844 --> 46:45.803
Find the book
and we'll let you

46:45.933 --> 46:47.500
and your children live.

46:47.630 --> 46:49.328
My daughter doesn't live!

46:49.458 --> 46:51.983
Quite the opposite, cousin;
she lives forever,

46:52.113 --> 46:54.724
and it's you who will die.

46:54.855 --> 46:57.118
Bring us the book
and join her.

46:57.249 --> 46:59.425
Drink from us and live.

46:59.555 --> 47:01.122
No more curse.

47:01.253 --> 47:04.734
The Boones will finally
have peace

47:04.865 --> 47:06.824
and prosper
in the coming dark.

47:09.174 --> 47:11.002
We'll be waiting, cousin.

47:12.220 --> 47:13.787
Stephen!

47:13.918 --> 47:15.354
Stephen!

47:25.494 --> 47:26.495
Loa!

47:28.410 --> 47:29.977
Loa!
