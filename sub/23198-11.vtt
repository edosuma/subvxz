01:45.652 --> 01:48.086
All personnel clear the test area.

01:48.489 --> 01:50.320
Bazooka teams are ready.

01:50.424 --> 01:52.392
Bomb squad is ready.

01:52.526 --> 01:54.585
Test vehicle is manned and ready.

01:55.863 --> 02:00.357
Five, four, three, two, one.

02:01.001 --> 02:02.468
Commence operation.

02:21.155 --> 02:23.783
Well, gentlemen, thank you very much.

02:25.426 --> 02:29.328
Boy! That was really
an impressive demonstration, General.

02:29.396 --> 02:31.864
Absolutely amazing.

02:32.166 --> 02:33.793
- Steve.
- Yes, sir.

02:34.034 --> 02:35.899
I wanted you to see for yourself...

02:35.969 --> 02:39.097
just how important
Professor Moreno's formula really is.

02:40.040 --> 02:42.304
The tires on that truck
were made of rubber...

02:42.376 --> 02:45.209
treated with Moreno's secret Formula 407.

02:46.113 --> 02:50.277
The land mine explosions, the bazooka shell,
they're all direct hits...

02:50.350 --> 02:53.080
- but not one sign of tire damage.
- Exactly.

02:53.153 --> 02:56.884
Moreno's formula not only makes rubber
practically as strong as steel...

02:56.957 --> 03:00.518
it also makes it more durable
than anything we've tested.

03:01.428 --> 03:04.056
Travel orders are being cut for you
right now.

03:04.965 --> 03:08.298
- Travel orders? For where?
- Buenos Aires.

03:08.502 --> 03:11.938
Professor Moreno's a neutral,
a citizen of Argentina...

03:12.172 --> 03:15.938
but he knows our cause is just
and has offered his formula to us.

03:16.443 --> 03:18.934
You'll proceed immediately,
pick up the formula...

03:19.012 --> 03:21.037
and hand-deliver it back to Washington.

03:21.115 --> 03:22.673
- Yeoman Prince.
- Yes, sir.

03:22.749 --> 03:25.582
According to your service file,
you speak Spanish.

03:25.719 --> 03:27.550
Yes, sir, I do, fluently.

03:27.821 --> 03:31.814
Good. You will accompany Maj. Trevor
and act as his official interpreter.

03:31.992 --> 03:33.254
Yes, sir.

03:33.694 --> 03:37.425
Why didn't I pay more attention
in my high school Spanish class?

03:37.498 --> 03:39.966
This isn't going to be a pleasure cruise.

03:40.167 --> 03:41.156
Yes, sir.

03:41.235 --> 03:43.703
Officially, Argentina's a neutral country.

03:43.770 --> 03:46.762
But there are a great many people there
who are very pro-German.

03:47.608 --> 03:51.408
I'll feel a lot better when you're both
back safely with that formula.

04:19.373 --> 04:23.173
- The consistency holds.
- For the hundredth time.

04:23.243 --> 04:25.734
With a formula of this importance,
you can't be too sure.

04:25.812 --> 04:28.007
But we are sure. It's a marvelous formula.

04:28.081 --> 04:30.982
We tested it and tested it,
and we tested it again.

04:31.051 --> 04:33.019
There is not a doubt in the world.

04:33.086 --> 04:35.748
It will do everything
you dreamed it would.

04:35.956 --> 04:37.685
Yes, I know you're right.

04:38.625 --> 04:40.786
But I've worked so hard for so many years.

04:40.861 --> 04:44.422
I can't believe it's developed exactly
as I calculated it would.

04:44.498 --> 04:46.693
If it weren't for this horrible war...

04:46.767 --> 04:49.133
you could publish a paper
on your formula...

04:49.203 --> 04:52.661
and win all the scientific awards
there are to win.

04:52.739 --> 04:57.233
Awards are not important, not while
half the world is fighting to survive.

04:57.644 --> 05:00.613
If my formula can help stop the killing...

05:00.714 --> 05:02.909
then all my work will have been worth it.

05:02.983 --> 05:06.111
We're Argentineans.
We're supposed to be neutral.

05:07.020 --> 05:10.353
Where Nazis are concerned,
how can one be neutral?

05:12.459 --> 05:15.155
Anyway, the American agents
will be here soon.

05:15.229 --> 05:17.424
They'll take the formula to Washington.

05:17.497 --> 05:20.330
And then Lydia and I will go on vacation.

05:20.601 --> 05:23.297
And if you wish,
you're more than welcome to join us.

05:23.370 --> 05:26.498
A vacation. That sounds very nice.

05:33.981 --> 05:37.883
...and inasmuch as our direct source
of raw rubber has been cut off...

05:37.951 --> 05:39.919
from here and here...

05:40.520 --> 05:44.047
you can well imagine how important
this Professor Moreno's formula...

05:44.124 --> 05:46.524
- has become to our war effort.
- Yes, sir.

05:46.727 --> 05:50.527
We must keep it out of the Americans'
hands at all costs, do you understand?

05:50.597 --> 05:51.825
Yes, sir.

05:51.898 --> 05:55.163
Not only out of their hands,
but you, Major...

05:56.503 --> 06:00.940
must bring it back here
to help bring about our own victory.

06:01.174 --> 06:02.971
Nothing will go wrong, sir.

06:03.277 --> 06:06.872
Our tanks will roll into Paris,
London, and New York...

06:07.214 --> 06:10.672
on treads made
of the Professor's Formula 407.

06:10.884 --> 06:15.218
When you return to Berlin, after what
I know will be a most successful mission...

06:15.355 --> 06:19.587
I'll personally see to it
that you're promoted to general staff rank.

06:19.893 --> 06:21.918
Thank you very much, sir.

06:23.063 --> 06:24.690
I will not fail.

06:36.543 --> 06:38.408
- Hi, Diana.
- Hi.

06:38.478 --> 06:39.775
Finished packing yet?

06:39.846 --> 06:42.178
Yes. And as soon as I finish
with these papers...

06:42.249 --> 06:44.649
Maj. Trevor and I
will be on our way to the airport.

06:44.718 --> 06:47.152
Do you have any idea
how much I envy you?

06:47.220 --> 06:49.085
You and Steve alone...

06:49.156 --> 06:52.557
under an incredibly huge
South American moon.

06:52.659 --> 06:54.854
That's scientifically impossible.

06:55.095 --> 06:58.656
The moon is the same size in the Northern
and Southern Hemispheres.

06:58.732 --> 07:01.599
- Diana, sometimes I don't understand you.
- Why?

07:02.102 --> 07:04.866
I'm talking about hot-blooded gauchos...

07:04.938 --> 07:08.203
sizzling romance, exciting adventure.

07:08.442 --> 07:12.401
You're talking as if you're going
around the corner to the grocery store.

07:12.713 --> 07:15.978
Well, this is an assignment, you know,
and I have to be on duty.

07:16.049 --> 07:19.507
I give up, Diana. You're hopeless.

07:43.777 --> 07:46.803
...and even though
Argentina's supposed to be neutral...

07:46.880 --> 07:48.507
it's still a pretty hot spot.

07:48.582 --> 07:49.640
Nazi agents?

07:49.716 --> 07:52.310
Agents, saboteurs, provocateurs,
you name it.

07:52.386 --> 07:55.287
It seems as if there are more accents here
than in Berlin.

07:55.355 --> 07:56.788
They all have Swiss passports...

07:56.857 --> 07:59.724
and all seem to work
for an import-export company in Geneva.

07:59.793 --> 08:01.920
- How did you know?
- Lucky guess.

08:02.095 --> 08:04.495
With all the pro-German sentiment here...

08:04.564 --> 08:06.862
we're lucky to have a friend
in Professor Moreno.

08:06.933 --> 08:08.628
You don't have to worry about that.

08:08.702 --> 08:11.296
Moreno's one of the great men
of this or any other time.

08:11.371 --> 08:14.829
He won't let anyone but us
have that formula. Thank God for that.

08:14.908 --> 08:16.739
It's a shame about all this.

08:16.943 --> 08:20.071
- Buenos Aires is such a lovely city.
- Yes, I can see.

08:20.380 --> 08:24.544
I hope I get to see everything. I promised
a friend I was gonna tell her all about it.

08:24.618 --> 08:28.714
The embassy is outside of town.
It's a lovely drive. You'll see everything.

08:29.055 --> 08:30.682
Thank you, sir.

08:39.698 --> 08:41.222
Americans!

08:41.967 --> 08:45.404
You can bet if they were Nazi agents,
they would arrive on time.

08:45.472 --> 08:48.908
Not in Buenos Aires.
Anyone would be late.

08:49.142 --> 08:51.633
Be patient, Hans. It won't be much longer.

08:51.711 --> 08:54.009
I never could stand waiting like this.

08:54.114 --> 08:55.945
Hans, patience.

08:56.783 --> 08:58.910
You're not in Munich beer cellars
any longer.

08:58.985 --> 09:01.146
You just can't break heads
like you used to.

09:14.768 --> 09:16.360
When we finish here...

09:16.470 --> 09:19.564
we'll let it be known in town
that the Argentine peasants...

09:19.639 --> 09:22.574
rose in fury against the hated Americans...

09:23.043 --> 09:25.273
in a spontaneous demonstration.

09:26.546 --> 09:29.811
The American agents will be taken care of.

09:30.116 --> 09:33.608
There'll be an exchange of letters
between foreign agencies.

09:34.287 --> 09:36.221
And that will be an end of it.

09:40.627 --> 09:41.924
Here they come!

10:05.252 --> 10:06.412
All right. Out!

10:06.486 --> 10:09.216
Leave the girl.
It's Trevor and the ambassador we want.

10:09.289 --> 10:10.654
All right. Out!

10:10.724 --> 10:13.625
- Don't worry. Take care of the driver.
- Come on. Move!

10:13.693 --> 10:15.354
Move along!

10:21.401 --> 10:22.629
Are you okay?

11:20.327 --> 11:22.318
Come on. Let's get out of here!

11:26.066 --> 11:28.466
Wonder Woman!
What are you doing in Buenos Aires?

11:28.535 --> 11:29.729
I came to help.

11:29.803 --> 11:32.931
Help? Young lady,
you were like the United States Cavalry.

11:33.006 --> 11:33.995
Cavalry?

11:34.174 --> 11:36.734
Yes, arriving in the nick of time like that.

11:37.477 --> 11:41.004
Didn't you ever go to the Saturday
matinees when you were a kid?

11:41.081 --> 11:44.847
You didn't? Then it's a date.
Someday I'll take you to the movies...

11:44.918 --> 11:48.445
and show you how the cavalry
always arrives in the nick of time.

11:49.356 --> 11:53.122
- Are you all right, Mr. Ambassador?
- Yeah, I'm fine, thanks to this young lady.

11:53.193 --> 11:56.321
If I hadn't seen that with my own eyes,
I wouldn't believe it.

11:56.396 --> 11:59.194
I still don't believe it.
I'll bet they don't, either.

11:59.265 --> 12:01.426
Thanks again.
We would have been in real trouble...

12:01.501 --> 12:03.128
if you hadn't come along when you did.

12:03.203 --> 12:05.637
- Yeoman Prince and the driver.
- They're all right.

12:05.705 --> 12:07.138
The driver was just stunned...

12:07.207 --> 12:10.176
and your very capable assistant
is taking care of him.

12:11.478 --> 12:12.467
Goodbye.

12:12.545 --> 12:14.570
- Wonder Woman, wait.
- Yes?

12:15.081 --> 12:17.413
We're going to a party
at Professor Moreno's.

12:17.484 --> 12:18.781
Why don't you come along?

12:18.852 --> 12:20.410
Are you expecting more trouble?

12:20.487 --> 12:23.012
As a matter of fact, we're not.
Quite the contrary.

12:23.089 --> 12:25.614
We expect it to be
a very enjoyable evening.

12:27.093 --> 12:31.154
Perhaps. We'll see.
I've never been in Buenos Aires before...

12:31.231 --> 12:33.791
and there are so many things
I'd like to see.

12:34.234 --> 12:35.599
Goodbye, Steve.

13:16.843 --> 13:18.140
It's lovely.

13:24.884 --> 13:27.182
Ambassador McCauley,
how nice of you to come.

13:27.253 --> 13:29.016
It's truly a pleasure to be here.

13:29.089 --> 13:30.818
Allow me to present Major Steve Trevor.

13:30.890 --> 13:32.448
- Maj. Trevor.
- How do you do?

13:32.525 --> 13:34.015
Yeoman Diana Prince.

13:34.994 --> 13:36.393
Miss Prince.

13:41.534 --> 13:43.468
It's really my fault that we're late.

13:43.536 --> 13:46.664
You see, I wanted to stop by the embassy
first to change clothes.

13:46.740 --> 13:50.676
May I say it was worth every minute.
You look lovely, Miss Prince.

13:52.579 --> 13:54.103
The days seemed like months...

13:54.180 --> 13:57.172
waiting for you to come and take
my formula safely to Washington.

13:57.250 --> 13:58.774
Tomorrow you shall have it...

13:58.852 --> 14:00.843
and all the supporting research journals...

14:00.920 --> 14:03.980
and my long waiting period will be over.

14:04.357 --> 14:07.588
Now, enough business.
I'd like you to meet my family. Come.

14:08.695 --> 14:12.392
Yeoman Prince, Maj. Trevor.
You know Ambassador McCauley.

14:12.832 --> 14:13.821
Maria.

14:13.967 --> 14:17.630
My pride and joy, the apple of my eye,
my daughter, Lydia.

14:17.704 --> 14:19.069
Papa.

14:19.139 --> 14:21.266
And my assistant, Maria.

14:23.009 --> 14:25.603
- It's so nice to meet you.
- It's a pleasure.

14:26.579 --> 14:29.844
There would be no great formula
if it were not for my Maria here.

14:29.916 --> 14:33.010
She's not only my assistant,
my researcher, but she's my...

14:33.086 --> 14:35.486
- how shall I say it?
- Your right hand?

14:35.588 --> 14:37.681
Yes. My right hand.

14:38.525 --> 14:40.841
But I'll be losing her
soon, isn't that so?

14:40.876 --> 14:42.190
Professor.

14:42.529 --> 14:46.056
And there he is, the man
who's gonna take her away from me:

14:46.132 --> 14:47.258
Her fiancé.

15:12.559 --> 15:15.426
Your wine is really very delicious,
Mr. Moreno.

15:15.495 --> 15:17.486
Thank you, Mr. Ambassador.

15:17.664 --> 15:20.030
When this terrible war is over...

15:20.099 --> 15:22.567
and more normal lines of distribution
are open...

15:22.635 --> 15:26.765
then the world will get to know
how wonderful our Argentinean wines are.

15:32.078 --> 15:34.444
It really is excellent wine, Professor.

15:35.381 --> 15:37.679
Perhaps when there's peace
in the world again...

15:37.750 --> 15:40.184
my firm can make some
exporting arrangements with you.

15:40.253 --> 15:41.618
I'd be delighted, Karl.

15:41.688 --> 15:45.954
I thought the European wines
were wonderful. Wouldn't that be like...

15:48.061 --> 15:50.154
Like carrying coals to Newcastle.

15:51.364 --> 15:53.730
That would be a tough sale,
wouldn't it, Mr. Keller?

15:53.800 --> 15:57.702
We Swiss are a stubborn breed.
Challenges urge us on to greater heights.

15:58.504 --> 15:59.766
In business?

16:01.741 --> 16:04.608
In everything, Mr. Trevor.

16:06.579 --> 16:08.206
Shall we go into the sitting room...

16:08.281 --> 16:11.273
where coffee, brandy, and, hopefully,
good conversation awaits us?

16:11.351 --> 16:14.411
- Thank you very much for the dinner.
- It was excellent.

16:15.788 --> 16:17.278
- Diana.
- Yes?

16:21.060 --> 16:23.494
- My one true weakness.
- What?

16:23.630 --> 16:24.892
American girls.

16:25.298 --> 16:27.528
You are so smart, so healthy.

16:29.569 --> 16:31.935
And you always have such a good figure.

16:32.705 --> 16:35.401
It's true, the legs are always good.

16:35.775 --> 16:36.764
The legs?

16:39.112 --> 16:40.636
Do you know, Diana...

16:40.780 --> 16:43.647
if you would only take
those terrible glasses off...

16:43.917 --> 16:45.908
you'd be a most attractive lady.

16:46.119 --> 16:48.917
I'm afraid a very near-sighted one, as well.

16:50.623 --> 16:54.115
I'm so very glad you have this business
with my father, Maj. Trevor.

16:54.193 --> 16:56.923
- Please, call me Steve.
- Steve.

16:57.397 --> 17:01.561
- Otherwise, we might never have met.
- Yes, I was just thinking the same thing.

17:01.634 --> 17:04.626
But then again,
perhaps we were fated to meet.

17:05.939 --> 17:08.669
- Do you believe in fate, Steve?
- Sometimes.

17:09.208 --> 17:11.574
- Now?
- Positively.

17:11.844 --> 17:13.936
Good, that makes me very happy.

17:19.185 --> 17:21.983
Our Lydia seems to be quite taken
with the American.

17:22.055 --> 17:25.455
Yes, Lydia's very young,
and he's quite attractive.

17:25.892 --> 17:27.587
It's a new game to her.

17:28.094 --> 17:30.062
She does play it very well.

17:32.865 --> 17:34.662
The American could very well be...

17:34.734 --> 17:37.396
in a great deal more danger
with her than with us.

17:37.470 --> 17:39.665
Please, Karl, you said
no one would get hurt.

17:39.739 --> 17:42.173
Of course no one will be hurt.

17:43.476 --> 17:47.378
But your Major Steve Trevor is one
of the Americans' great war heroes.

17:47.580 --> 17:49.241
If he should try to stop us...

17:49.315 --> 17:51.078
Karl, you promised.

17:51.150 --> 17:55.086
I will try my very best
to see that no one is hurt.

17:55.154 --> 17:57.884
I gave you my word as an officer on that.

17:58.992 --> 18:00.220
Besides...

18:01.227 --> 18:03.923
the formula is the only
really important thing.

18:04.831 --> 18:09.200
It will help us win the war that much
sooner and put an end to all the suffering.

18:10.370 --> 18:12.838
That's not such a bad goal, is it?

18:13.106 --> 18:15.506
Why don't you join the others
in the living room?

18:15.575 --> 18:17.975
I'm going to take a walk
and get a little fresh air.

18:18.044 --> 18:20.069
I'll join you in a little while.

19:00.353 --> 19:01.843
Major Keller.

19:02.588 --> 19:06.024
Sorry, sir. We didn't realize it was you.

19:07.393 --> 19:09.861
Thank you. Very good.

19:10.396 --> 19:12.626
I'm delighted to see you're so alert.

19:12.698 --> 19:15.428
Your orders are to see
no one leaves and you're doing that.

19:15.501 --> 19:17.696
- Are all your men in position?
- Yes, sir.

19:17.770 --> 19:18.759
Good.

19:18.871 --> 19:21.499
- All the estate exits are covered.
- Very good.

19:22.875 --> 19:24.866
We've had a stroke of good luck.

19:25.645 --> 19:28.478
Not only are we going
to snatch the formula...

19:28.548 --> 19:31.415
right out from under
the Americans' noses...

19:32.852 --> 19:36.845
but they've sent one of their most famous
war heroes here to pick it up.

19:37.223 --> 19:39.384
Major Steve Trevor.

19:40.827 --> 19:42.886
We'll take him back with us.

19:43.429 --> 19:45.522
But, Major, what of Wonder Woman?

19:45.698 --> 19:48.861
I know what you said,
it was all in your report. But really...

19:48.935 --> 19:52.837
But it was true, Major. She threw
our men around as if they were pebbles.

19:52.905 --> 19:57.365
I would have to see this Wonder Woman
for myself.

19:58.311 --> 20:00.472
She was successful last time...

20:01.013 --> 20:03.140
because she took you by surprise.

20:04.117 --> 20:06.915
You will be ready for her next time,
won't you?

20:06.986 --> 20:08.010
Yes, sir.

20:08.087 --> 20:10.988
Then let me hear no more
of any super-powerful woman...

20:11.057 --> 20:13.150
who defeats Nazi soldiers.

20:14.527 --> 20:17.428
Keep your men alert
and wait for my signal.

20:33.012 --> 20:34.479
What is it, Maria?

20:35.481 --> 20:37.176
Nothing, I was just thinking.

20:37.250 --> 20:40.185
No more of that,
we've done enough thinking for one day.

20:40.253 --> 20:41.948
And first-rate thinking, too.

20:42.021 --> 20:46.117
My reports from Washington are that
that formula of yours is extraordinary.

20:46.626 --> 20:49.094
My only wish is
your government puts it to good use...

20:49.162 --> 20:51.357
and ends this terrible war
as quickly as possible.

20:51.430 --> 20:52.863
You can count on it.

20:54.033 --> 20:58.629
Please, Mr. Antonio, you'll really have
to stop saying things like that.

20:58.871 --> 20:59.963
How can I?

21:00.573 --> 21:03.701
Behind those awful glasses
and that severe hairstyle...

21:03.809 --> 21:07.210
there's an exciting, vibrant,
beautiful woman. I'm sure of it.

21:09.916 --> 21:11.941
But it's true and I must say it.

21:17.790 --> 21:19.587
What a lovely night.

21:20.259 --> 21:23.660
A bright moon, all those stars.

21:25.631 --> 21:28.828
- It would be a shame to waste it.
- We're not going to.

21:29.635 --> 21:33.901
Come on, Steve, I will show you why
Argentine nights like this are so famous.

21:34.440 --> 21:37.466
- Famous? For what?
- That's what I'm going to show you.

21:46.919 --> 21:50.821
Please, Mr. Antonio, I do think
you are getting the wrong idea.

21:51.057 --> 21:53.184
But how can romance
ever be the wrong idea?

21:53.259 --> 21:55.784
When there's only one person
with it on their mind.

21:55.861 --> 21:57.852
I believe you have a phrase
here in Argentina:

21:57.930 --> 21:59.522
It takes two to tango.

22:00.099 --> 22:01.396
Diana, my dear.

22:01.500 --> 22:05.231
Mr. Antonio, I'm afraid I must warn you...

22:05.605 --> 22:08.972
the W.A.V.E. Training manual
is quite explicit on its instructions...

22:09.041 --> 22:11.066
on the handling of unwarranted attentions.

22:11.143 --> 22:13.270
But what do instruction manuals know?

22:13.346 --> 22:16.474
I'll bet there's not one chapter
on Argentine gentlemen.

22:16.716 --> 22:19.276
If you keep this up,
there's going to be one.

22:24.323 --> 22:28.225
Your friend Antonio's
really rushing Yeoman Prince.

22:28.461 --> 22:30.622
She's an attractive woman...

22:30.696 --> 22:33.927
and South American men are trapped
by the "romantic lover" image...

22:34.000 --> 22:36.161
they feel they must forever uphold.

22:36.602 --> 22:40.971
But beware, it's we South American
women who are really dangerous.

22:43.976 --> 22:45.466
How dangerous?

22:59.058 --> 23:00.389
You're beautiful.

23:01.160 --> 23:04.755
I knew the romance of the Argentine
nights would finally get to you.

23:04.830 --> 23:07.094
May I have a glass of champagne, please?

23:07.166 --> 23:09.691
Yes, of course. I'll be right back.

23:09.769 --> 23:11.259
Thank you very much.

24:27.546 --> 24:29.946
- Good morning, Professor.
- Good morning.

24:30.850 --> 24:33.478
- Have you been here all night?
- Yes.

24:34.720 --> 24:36.244
I'm sorry I left the party so early.

24:36.322 --> 24:40.156
I just wanted to recheck everything
before turning it over to the Americans.

24:40.226 --> 24:44.663
- Did you see everyone off all right?
- Yes. Yeoman Prince left early by herself.

24:44.830 --> 24:47.594
Anything to get rid of Antonio.

24:48.300 --> 24:51.167
He was furious.
He left in a huff right afterwards.

24:51.704 --> 24:54.002
The ambassador left on his own, too.

24:54.073 --> 24:57.531
And Maj. Trevor was with Lydia
in the gardens.

24:59.011 --> 25:01.172
They make a wonderful couple, don't they?

25:01.247 --> 25:02.475
Yes, they do.

25:03.716 --> 25:06.708
But still, alone...

25:07.219 --> 25:10.780
so late in the garden on their first date.
They should've been chaperoned.

25:10.856 --> 25:14.485
Professor. It's 1942.

25:14.560 --> 25:18.018
There is nothing wrong with
a pretty young lady like Lydia...

25:18.264 --> 25:21.700
to share the moonlight in the garden
with a very handsome man.

25:21.867 --> 25:23.767
Until all hours of the night?

25:27.072 --> 25:29.597
I'll have to talk with her when she gets up.

26:01.540 --> 26:05.636
Hello. It's hardly a good morning.

26:08.647 --> 26:10.137
Are you all right?

26:12.017 --> 26:15.953
I think so.
They must have used chloroform on me.

26:16.355 --> 26:17.845
It smells terrible.

26:18.724 --> 26:20.316
I think I'm all right.

26:21.126 --> 26:22.855
We're in a wine cellar.

26:23.262 --> 26:27.596
Don't try yelling for help. I've done that.
These walls must be four feet thick.

26:28.367 --> 26:31.165
It's obvious
the Nazis are after Formula 407.

26:34.773 --> 26:37.606
- Can you stand up?
- I can try.

26:40.579 --> 26:44.276
- You sure you're okay?
- I'll be fine in a moment.

26:46.452 --> 26:49.216
Whatever it was they gave you
sure packs a wallop.

26:49.288 --> 26:50.312
A wallop?

26:51.490 --> 26:54.789
It's just an expression.
The main thing is you're all right.

26:57.129 --> 26:58.960
- There we go.
- Incredible.

27:05.404 --> 27:07.338
Maybe we can trick the guards.

27:15.814 --> 27:17.714
If I can just tip this over.

27:21.453 --> 27:22.943
Get their attention.

27:29.762 --> 27:30.990
Wonder Woman.

27:43.309 --> 27:44.970
Come on. Hurry up!

27:57.222 --> 27:59.554
But señor Keller, I don't understand.

28:00.292 --> 28:03.352
It's not señor, it's Major Keller...

28:03.696 --> 28:06.187
on special assignment with the S.S.

28:07.766 --> 28:10.758
So this is your nice Swiss fiancé?
This Nazi?

28:11.003 --> 28:13.563
There is no need
to be concerned, Professor.

28:13.739 --> 28:17.334
I will guarantee the safety
of you and your family.

28:17.977 --> 28:19.205
And the Americans?

28:19.278 --> 28:23.442
They are of no consequence.
I am only concerned with the formula.

28:32.925 --> 28:35.052
No, I cannot give it to you.

28:35.928 --> 28:39.694
Please, Professor,
it would be better if you do.

28:40.232 --> 28:43.998
How could anything be better with
you people out to destroy the world?

28:45.771 --> 28:48.069
It is unfortunate you feel that way.

28:49.174 --> 28:51.574
Not only must we have the real formula...

28:51.644 --> 28:55.512
but you must construct a false formula
to send to Washington.

28:55.981 --> 29:00.418
That way the Americans will manufacture
defective, inferior rubber for months...

29:00.486 --> 29:02.386
before they realize what's happened.

29:02.454 --> 29:06.686
And with that defective equipment
doing battle with ours...

29:06.925 --> 29:09.155
the odds will be so much in our favor...

29:09.228 --> 29:12.720
that I really will have earned
my promotion, won't I?

29:15.668 --> 29:18.193
There's only one thing wrong
with your plan.

29:19.438 --> 29:22.373
You can never get me
to do anything for you.

29:22.808 --> 29:25.675
Never say never, Professor.

29:31.050 --> 29:32.347
I said never.

29:33.252 --> 29:37.916
Even if it means never seeing
your daughter, Lydia, again?

29:38.991 --> 29:39.980
Lydia?

29:41.293 --> 29:44.194
- What have you done with her?
- We have her prisoner.

29:45.264 --> 29:48.700
She is quite safe. For now.

29:50.602 --> 29:54.197
But you must cooperate
to keep her that way.

29:55.407 --> 29:58.865
You're lying.
She's sleeping upstairs in her room.

29:58.944 --> 30:00.639
I'm afraid not.

30:00.846 --> 30:03.713
She went for a walk after dinner
with the American.

30:04.950 --> 30:08.010
And that's the last time you saw her.

30:08.587 --> 30:10.214
Isn't that right?

30:11.090 --> 30:14.287
Their moonlit stroll was...

30:15.894 --> 30:19.591
shall we say "interrupted. "

30:20.899 --> 30:23.800
The American is now tied up
in your basement...

30:23.869 --> 30:27.327
and Lydia is our guest somewhere.

30:27.506 --> 30:29.440
You said no one would be hurt!

30:29.508 --> 30:31.533
And you believed him, this Nazi!

30:33.045 --> 30:34.945
You have exactly one hour...

30:35.380 --> 30:38.315
to see that the real formula
is delivered to me.

30:49.661 --> 30:52.687
I wonder what happened to Yeoman Prince
and Ambassador McCauley.

30:52.765 --> 30:55.598
I'm sure they're probably very safely
back at the embassy.

30:55.667 --> 30:59.660
Must have left last night thinking I was
still out sharing the moonlight with Lydia.

30:59.738 --> 31:02.070
Lydia! Why didn't they have her
tied up with us?

31:02.141 --> 31:04.905
Steve, she's much too valuable to them.

31:04.977 --> 31:08.413
I'm sure they've got her
in a very special hiding place.

31:08.480 --> 31:11.381
Right. That's how they'll put
pressure on Professor Moreno.

31:23.662 --> 31:24.890
Maria...

31:26.165 --> 31:28.099
Please, don't cry.

31:28.433 --> 31:29.923
Come sit down.

31:30.636 --> 31:32.331
It's all my fault.

31:33.071 --> 31:35.369
I've made such a mess of things.

31:35.440 --> 31:37.806
You believed a man who lied to you.

31:38.010 --> 31:41.173
Women have been making that mistake
for centuries.

31:41.246 --> 31:45.376
But now, because of me,
we might never see Lydia again.

31:46.018 --> 31:47.815
We will see her again.

31:49.588 --> 31:52.921
You can't give Karl the formula.

31:54.927 --> 31:58.522
I thought of him as a decent man...

31:58.597 --> 32:02.158
only interested in ending the war
as quickly as possible.

32:05.804 --> 32:06.998
Now...

32:07.472 --> 32:11.033
I know him for what he really is.

32:11.977 --> 32:13.604
Another murderer.

32:14.046 --> 32:18.779
Please, Professor,
you can't give them the formula...

32:18.951 --> 32:20.646
and help them win.

32:21.620 --> 32:23.178
I know I can't.

32:25.791 --> 32:29.283
But I can't stand by
and watch them kill Lydia, either.

32:32.030 --> 32:35.227
Now, please, leave me to my work.

32:35.434 --> 32:37.561
Go and rest. Go on.

32:38.537 --> 32:42.098
I will do whatever I have to do.

33:43.135 --> 33:44.568
Professor Moreno.

33:44.636 --> 33:47.696
- Maj. Trevor, you're all right.
- Yes, I'm okay.

33:47.773 --> 33:50.833
And this must be
the famous Wonder Woman.

33:50.909 --> 33:52.399
You flatter me, Professor.

33:52.477 --> 33:54.240
The best friend any of us will ever have.

33:54.313 --> 33:56.281
But they said
they were holding you prisoner.

33:56.348 --> 33:58.077
They were.
Wonder Woman helped me escape.

33:58.150 --> 34:00.243
They said
they were holding Lydia prisoner, too.

34:00.319 --> 34:01.843
Where's Lydia?

34:01.920 --> 34:05.117
I'm sorry, we don't know.
But don't worry, we'll find her.

34:05.190 --> 34:07.021
If they lied about keeping you prisoner...

34:07.092 --> 34:09.286
they must have lied
about keeping Lydia prisoner.

34:09.360 --> 34:12.420
No, they had me tied up
and neatly locked away, that's for sure.

34:12.496 --> 34:15.364
They jumped us last night
when Lydia and I were taking a walk.

34:15.434 --> 34:17.527
We've looked all through the house
for her.

34:17.601 --> 34:21.163
We've had to be very careful
because they've got guards everywhere.

34:21.239 --> 34:23.264
We're sure they're not holding her here.

34:23.342 --> 34:24.603
Yes, but where?

34:24.676 --> 34:26.837
Wherever it is, she's probably very secure.

34:26.911 --> 34:29.107
They're using her to pressure you
for the formula.

34:29.181 --> 34:31.081
I know, Keller told us that.

34:31.149 --> 34:33.481
- Keller? He's behind this?
- Yes.

34:35.587 --> 34:37.282
Yes, I'm afraid so.

34:37.856 --> 34:39.255
Professor...

34:40.559 --> 34:43.152
you aren't going to give them
the formula, are you?

34:43.228 --> 34:44.889
I have no choice.

34:44.963 --> 34:48.126
I know what it will mean to the world
for the Nazis to win this war.

34:48.199 --> 34:52.795
But I'm not strong enough to stand by and
watch my daughter, my child, in danger.

34:52.871 --> 34:54.099
Professor Moreno...

34:54.172 --> 34:57.403
I know how you must feel,
but you can't give them that formula.

34:57.476 --> 35:00.673
Please, give us some time,
we'll find Lydia for you.

35:00.746 --> 35:04.238
No, I cannot take a chance
on my daughter's life.

35:04.383 --> 35:06.112
Professor, trust us.

35:06.184 --> 35:09.085
I promise,
we'll get her back safely for you.

35:47.692 --> 35:48.954
Who are you?

35:49.027 --> 35:50.119
A friend.

35:50.195 --> 35:51.423
Whose friend?

35:51.496 --> 35:52.986
Yours, I hope.

35:53.899 --> 35:56.026
- What do you want?
- To help.

35:56.435 --> 35:58.164
We must find Lydia.

35:58.403 --> 36:00.735
You're a stranger,
I've never seen you before.

36:00.806 --> 36:02.706
Why do you care
what happens to any of us?

36:02.774 --> 36:05.572
Why shouldn't I care? You're good people.

36:05.944 --> 36:07.002
All of you.

36:18.323 --> 36:20.120
It is all done, sir.

36:20.192 --> 36:22.592
The girl is in the cabin, tied and bound.

36:22.661 --> 36:25.459
We have communicated with U-boat 275...

36:25.697 --> 36:28.860
and they will rendezvous as ordered
at 1400 hours.

36:28.934 --> 36:32.028
Good. 1400 hours will give us
plenty of time.

36:32.637 --> 36:35.606
Maria, I know you made a mistake.

36:35.674 --> 36:38.268
And I can understand
how that could happen.

36:38.343 --> 36:40.277
I saw the way you looked at Keller.

36:40.345 --> 36:41.710
Saw? When?

36:41.780 --> 36:45.375
That doesn't really matter.
I know you loved him very much.

36:45.450 --> 36:49.045
And he used that love to make you betray
the Professor and Lydia.

36:51.223 --> 36:53.214
I know how you must feel.

36:53.792 --> 36:55.555
No, you can't know.

36:57.295 --> 36:59.229
I do understand.

37:00.732 --> 37:02.996
That's why you must help us find her.

37:04.769 --> 37:06.361
If only I could.

37:10.308 --> 37:12.276
Karl never told me the truth.

37:12.477 --> 37:15.071
Not about Lydia, not about anything.

37:16.781 --> 37:20.512
I don't know where they're holding Lydia.
I don't know!

37:24.222 --> 37:27.055
The Professor will give us
the real formula...

37:27.125 --> 37:29.650
deliver the false one to the Americans...

37:30.328 --> 37:34.128
and we will be on our way
back to Berlin as heroes.

37:35.433 --> 37:36.900
And the girl?

37:36.968 --> 37:40.301
It will be your duty, Dietrich,
to take care of her.

37:53.084 --> 37:55.177
Keller's down there with his men.

37:55.453 --> 37:56.681
Yes, it's time.

37:56.755 --> 38:00.657
They've come for the formula
and the supporting research journals.

38:00.725 --> 38:02.420
And will you give it to them?

38:02.494 --> 38:04.291
I still don't know.

38:04.663 --> 38:07.791
I don't want them to have it
any more than you do...

38:07.866 --> 38:09.857
it's my daughter that they're holding.

38:16.975 --> 38:18.272
Let's go.

38:20.979 --> 38:24.107
Time's up.
You're gonna have to make a decision.

38:26.151 --> 38:27.448
All right.

38:28.687 --> 38:31.281
Maj. Trevor,
I'll do whatever you think is best.

38:31.356 --> 38:32.482
Good.

38:32.624 --> 38:35.388
- Do you have a phony formula ready?
- Yes.

38:35.460 --> 38:39.055
All right. The first thing I want you to do
is pass it off as the real thing.

38:39.130 --> 38:40.222
When they leave with it...

38:40.298 --> 38:43.461
I'll follow them and make sure
that Lydia is safely released.

38:43.535 --> 38:44.900
All right.

38:50.909 --> 38:52.877
You, come with me.
Schmidt, guard the door.

39:12.397 --> 39:14.194
Your hour is up, Professor.

39:14.266 --> 39:16.894
Yes, I'm just finished.

39:20.538 --> 39:24.133
Here's the formula
and the research journal.

39:39.357 --> 39:43.350
It's very foolish of you
to try and trick me this way, Professor.

39:43.828 --> 39:46.388
Trick you? I don't know what you mean.

39:46.865 --> 39:49.095
This is not the real formula.

39:52.804 --> 39:56.535
Why do you suppose the high command
singled me out for this mission?

39:56.741 --> 40:01.542
Before the war, I was a research assistant
working on a formula similar to yours.

40:01.613 --> 40:03.843
We never achieved the success you have.

40:03.915 --> 40:08.079
But I'm still experienced enough
to know an unworkable formula...

40:08.153 --> 40:10.348
for what it is when I see it.

40:12.357 --> 40:15.485
I want the real formula, Professor...

40:15.560 --> 40:17.960
and I want it right now.

40:18.363 --> 40:19.557
But I assure...

40:19.631 --> 40:23.067
And I mean right now.

40:50.395 --> 40:52.192
Thank you, Professor.

40:53.732 --> 40:58.169
You've performed a great deed
for the Third Reich and we thank you for it.

41:00.405 --> 41:02.430
You will release my Lydia?

41:20.125 --> 41:21.888
Lock the old man up.

41:30.802 --> 41:34.465
Both the formula
and a captured American war hero.

41:36.508 --> 41:37.998
Quite a coup.

41:51.256 --> 41:53.417
Let me see what's happening.

41:59.197 --> 42:01.256
Cover the back.

42:12.243 --> 42:13.676
We must stop them.

42:13.745 --> 42:15.144
No, it's better if I follow them.

42:15.213 --> 42:18.205
Stay here and look after Professor Moreno.

42:32.063 --> 42:36.261
Perhaps it would be better
if there were no witnesses left alive...

42:36.334 --> 42:38.427
in neutral Argentina.

42:38.536 --> 42:40.436
Yes, sir. I understand.

42:40.738 --> 42:42.763
- Join us at the beach.
- Yes, sir.

43:06.431 --> 43:08.194
You there, stop!

43:25.483 --> 43:29.112
Where are they taking Maj. Trevor?
And where are they holding Lydia Moreno?

43:29.187 --> 43:30.176
No.

43:30.255 --> 43:32.189
Tell me, where is Maj. Trevor?

43:32.790 --> 43:36.419
A rendezvous on the beach
with a U-boat, 1400 hours.

43:36.528 --> 43:37.586
And Lydia?

43:37.662 --> 43:40.460
An old shack, on a cliff above the beach.

43:42.367 --> 43:45.564
Take care of the Professor.
He can't harm you now.

44:17.001 --> 44:19.663
All right, let's get him to the beach.

44:22.006 --> 44:23.496
Come on. Out.

44:28.413 --> 44:29.971
Come on, move!

44:42.827 --> 44:45.091
All right, this is far enough.

44:50.468 --> 44:52.698
Our transportation is waiting.

44:55.873 --> 44:57.465
Take care of the girl.

45:42.854 --> 45:45.322
- Are you all right?
- Yes, thank you.

45:46.758 --> 45:48.919
- You're sure you're all right?
- Yes.

45:50.128 --> 45:51.254
Okay.

45:51.863 --> 45:54.195
Now don't worry. Stay here.

45:55.800 --> 45:57.267
I'll be right back.

46:34.138 --> 46:36.265
It's Wonder Woman. Get her.

47:20.485 --> 47:22.544
Hi, what took you so long?

47:23.488 --> 47:24.648
Steve.

47:36.667 --> 47:39.864
Diana, the postcard
made it sound so exciting.

47:40.204 --> 47:42.764
And a handsome,
romantic South American...

47:42.840 --> 47:44.967
and all that moonlight, and walking...

47:45.042 --> 47:48.443
And don't forget a half a dozen Nazis
and a squad of enemy frogmen.

47:48.513 --> 47:50.105
Come on, Steve.

47:50.648 --> 47:53.640
Buenos Aires is still a very romantic place.

47:53.718 --> 47:56.243
In fact,
I'd like to go back there sometime...

47:56.320 --> 47:58.379
when there's time to enjoy it.

47:58.456 --> 48:00.686
And with a special someone...

48:00.892 --> 48:02.757
just like in a movie.

48:02.827 --> 48:05.921
If that special someone happens to be
Antonio Cruz...

48:05.997 --> 48:07.828
I wouldn't bet on him waiting for anyone.

48:07.899 --> 48:10.367
No, he wasn't the one I had in mind.

48:10.434 --> 48:13.926
But, maybe Lydia will still be
waiting for you.

48:15.173 --> 48:16.572
Lydia?

48:19.310 --> 48:20.902
Private Candy...

48:21.045 --> 48:24.105
please tell General Blankenship
I've just come back from Ordnance.

48:24.182 --> 48:27.015
And the first heavy equipment
using the Professor's formula...

48:27.084 --> 48:29.245
will come off the production line
within a week.

48:29.320 --> 48:31.481
Yes, sir, I'll tell him right away.

48:35.126 --> 48:36.286
Later.

48:39.497 --> 48:41.192
If it wasn't for Wonder Woman...

48:41.265 --> 48:44.723
that formula would be
in the hands of the enemy by now.

48:44.836 --> 48:47.930
I wonder how she always knows
when we need her the most.

48:48.005 --> 48:51.099
Well, it could be feminine intuition.

49:57.041 --> 49:58.030
