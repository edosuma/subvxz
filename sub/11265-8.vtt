00:00.485 --> 00:02.976
[Archer yawns, groans]

00:03.009 --> 00:04.911
[Cyril] Archer, hey,
I'm glad you're here.

00:04.944 --> 00:07.447
- I'm sure you are.
- Because I could kind of use your help.

00:07.479 --> 00:10.249
I'm sure you could. But unless
it's helping you leave me alone

00:10.282 --> 00:12.252
until I finish my
breakfast burrito, I...

00:12.285 --> 00:15.488
- It's actually about your mother.
- Oh. Is she in this burrito?

00:15.521 --> 00:17.757
- No, but...
- Then sorry. My hands are tied.

00:17.790 --> 00:19.525
I wouldn't go in there if I were you.

00:19.558 --> 00:21.994
Cyril, if you were me, I'd
drink a bunch of antifreeze

00:22.028 --> 00:24.363
and then jump off a
bridge, holding a giant toaster.

00:24.396 --> 00:27.199
[whirring, beeping]

00:27.232 --> 00:29.635
Oh, not you, buddy. Not...

00:29.668 --> 00:31.104
you!

00:31.137 --> 00:32.939
In the well-toned flesh.

00:32.972 --> 00:35.609
Aaahh! [grunts]

00:35.641 --> 00:38.345
On second thought, I
will have a glass of that.

00:38.378 --> 00:41.148
Oh, good. I do hate to drink alone.

00:41.180 --> 00:44.150
[clears throat] I'm here.

00:44.183 --> 00:47.620
Well, but this is a
Grande Cuvée, so... [chuckles]

00:47.653 --> 00:48.954
Cheers!

00:48.988 --> 00:51.457
And here's to a lucrative reunion.

00:51.491 --> 00:53.192
[Archer] And here's to what the shit?

00:53.226 --> 00:56.396
Why is Slater here? Why are
you drinking champagne with him?

00:56.429 --> 00:58.665
And may I please have
some of said champagne?

00:58.697 --> 01:02.802
In reverse order, no, I was
mildly thirsty, and he wants to hire us.

01:02.835 --> 01:04.569
To do what, kill another scientist?

01:04.604 --> 01:06.006
And whose fault was that?

01:06.039 --> 01:07.974
- I don't remember.
- Well...

01:08.007 --> 01:09.727
But whatever CIA bullshit you want

01:09.752 --> 01:11.545
us to do, Slater, the answer is no.

01:11.578 --> 01:13.714
- Well, let's at least hear him out.
- [laughs]

01:13.747 --> 01:17.016
- Are you literally insane?
- No, but I'll tell you what is,

01:17.049 --> 01:19.218
A.J.'s tuition for
Country Day preschool.

01:19.251 --> 01:20.920
Wait. I thought she
was banned from there.

01:20.953 --> 01:24.690
She was, until we
made a sizable donation

01:24.724 --> 01:27.326
- to their endowment fund.
- Wh... How sizable?

01:27.360 --> 01:29.528
Uhh, we should probably hear him out.

01:29.561 --> 01:31.864
- Goddamn it. What?
- Okay.

01:31.897 --> 01:34.101
I assume you're all familiar
with The Manchurian Candidate?

01:34.134 --> 01:36.403
- The Frank Sinatra movie?
- Oh, my God.

01:36.435 --> 01:38.026
How the hell does this have anything to

01:38.051 --> 01:39.538
do with a movie about three sailors,

01:39.572 --> 01:41.188
Gabey, Chip and Ozzie, who fall

01:41.213 --> 01:42.909
in love with three crazy gals,

01:42.941 --> 01:45.057
Ivy, Hildy and Claire, during a

01:45.082 --> 01:47.446
24-hour shore leave in New York?

01:47.480 --> 01:49.182
Oh, and it's a musical?

01:49.215 --> 01:50.783
That's On the Town!

01:50.817 --> 01:54.054
And also Bea Benaderet's film debut.

01:54.086 --> 01:56.756
Jethro's mom? Uh, Tweety's Granny?

01:56.789 --> 01:58.557
- You done?
- Yes.

01:58.591 --> 02:00.193
- Okay, so...
- Kate Bradley?

02:00.226 --> 02:01.762
- [sighs]
- Mrs. Barney Rubble?

02:01.794 --> 02:04.396
- Thanks for the champagne.
- No, no, no! Wait, wait!

02:04.430 --> 02:06.399
He won't say another word.

02:06.431 --> 02:09.901
- Please, don't go.
- [sighs] All right.

02:09.936 --> 02:13.105
But only because my other
options are somehow even worse.

02:13.139 --> 02:15.108
So, what do you want us to do?

02:15.140 --> 02:17.276
Short answer, prevent World War III.

02:17.310 --> 02:19.746
And longer answer... Where's the, uh...

02:19.778 --> 02:21.313
Oh. Sorry.

02:21.347 --> 02:24.217
Help me prevent a former CIA agent,

02:24.250 --> 02:27.319
Ken Hinkins, who was brainwashed
in the MK-ULTRA program,

02:27.353 --> 02:29.756
from assassinating a
visiting Soviet dignitary,

02:29.788 --> 02:31.991
thus triggering a chain
of geopolitical events

02:32.025 --> 02:34.060
that would lead to World War III.

02:34.092 --> 02:36.262
So, questions? Comments?

02:37.496 --> 02:40.133
That aren't about Bea Benaderet?

03:23.543 --> 03:26.545
[Archer] So, listen, I know
the CIA sucks at everything,

03:26.579 --> 03:29.683
but can they really
not find this Hinkins guy?

03:29.716 --> 03:32.853
- Why'd you come to us?
- Well, for one thing, I saw this.

03:32.885 --> 03:34.854
- Goddamn it! Give me that!
- And obviously,

03:34.888 --> 03:38.224
the agency could find him,
ass, but this is off the books.

03:38.258 --> 03:40.326
Wait. As in illegal, or...

03:40.359 --> 03:42.661
[chuckles] Lana, everything the CIA does

03:42.694 --> 03:44.830
within the borders of the
United States is illegal.

03:44.864 --> 03:47.533
Especially Project MK-ULTRA!

03:47.567 --> 03:49.169
Wait. MK-ULTRA...

03:49.201 --> 03:52.038
That was the CIA's mind-control
program, right?

03:52.070 --> 03:54.198
Yeah, it's since
been, uh, discredited, but...

03:54.223 --> 03:54.907
[laughs]

03:54.941 --> 03:58.043
- Discredited for being batshit-crazy!
- It wasn't...

03:58.076 --> 04:01.081
And for being in direct
violation of the Nuremberg Code,

04:01.113 --> 04:02.821
which was written because of medical

04:02.846 --> 04:04.483
experiments by Nazi war criminals,

04:04.516 --> 04:06.485
many of whom, after World War II...

04:06.519 --> 04:09.923
spoiler alert... came to
work for the C-I-goddamn-A!

04:09.956 --> 04:10.757
Wait, what?

04:10.782 --> 04:13.159
Look, the Soviets were
kicking our ass in the Cold War.

04:13.192 --> 04:15.161
Our scientists had to
think outside the box.

04:15.194 --> 04:18.164
Oh, is that the box where
they kept informed consent?

04:18.197 --> 04:20.399
Because I'm pretty sure that
all those mental patients

04:20.432 --> 04:23.168
the CIA force-fed LSD didn't give it!

04:23.201 --> 04:25.538
- Wait, what?
- Mental patients, Lana.

04:25.571 --> 04:29.042
They gave them LSD every
day for six months.

04:29.074 --> 04:31.343
Not six months. The longest one was only

04:31.377 --> 04:33.780
- a hundred and seventy-four days.
- That is six months.

04:33.812 --> 04:36.682
Oh, and what about Project
Artichoke, before Ultra,

04:36.716 --> 04:39.886
where you dick-bags got
innocent people addicted to morphine?

04:39.918 --> 04:41.659
Look, all that crazy drug stuff was

04:41.684 --> 04:43.255
intentionally "secretly" leaked

04:43.288 --> 04:44.667
to divert attention from the

04:44.692 --> 04:46.293
real goal of Project MK-ULTRA,

04:46.326 --> 04:48.561
which was mind control through
hypnosis and torture.

04:48.593 --> 04:50.230
Is that supposed to make it better?

04:50.262 --> 04:51.864
It's not supposed to make it anything!

04:51.898 --> 04:53.733
Take a right on Sunset.

04:53.766 --> 04:56.236
[tires screeching]

04:56.269 --> 04:57.916
No, but for real, though, the CIA

04:57.941 --> 04:59.805
really drugged and hypnotized people?

04:59.839 --> 05:02.124
Oh, please! That's merely the tip

05:02.149 --> 05:04.610
of a very dark and twisted iceberg.

05:04.644 --> 05:06.696
Trust me, if there's a hell, those

05:06.721 --> 05:08.748
creepy Dulles brothers are in it.

05:08.781 --> 05:11.651
- Doing unspeakable things with bananas.
- [sighs]

05:11.684 --> 05:13.286
Then why would you decide...

05:13.319 --> 05:16.923
without even consulting
me, the owner of the agency...

05:16.956 --> 05:18.792
to work for the CIA again?

05:18.824 --> 05:21.293
Because my pool needs to be retiled.

05:21.326 --> 05:23.663
And all new coping, whatever that is.

05:23.696 --> 05:25.465
I don't know. I mean, I'm not saying

05:25.497 --> 05:27.399
you can't zap somebody's
brain with LSD...

05:27.432 --> 05:29.635
Oh, my God, even a baby knows that.

05:29.668 --> 05:31.837
But nobody can hypnotize
me if I didn't wanna be.

05:31.870 --> 05:33.404
[scoffs] Are you kidding? I could

05:33.429 --> 05:35.074
hypnotize everybody in this office.

05:35.108 --> 05:36.675
- No, you couldn't!
- Oh, you can't!

05:36.709 --> 05:39.012
No, but without psychotropic drugs.

05:39.045 --> 05:40.724
Or your goddamn brain chips, like you

05:40.749 --> 05:42.314
made that rabbit a vegetable with.

05:42.348 --> 05:44.250
Well, and also a human being.

05:44.283 --> 05:48.088
- No, none of that. Just pure hypnosis.
- [overlapping responses]

05:48.120 --> 05:49.896
But if I can hypnotize you, you all

05:49.921 --> 05:51.623
have to come see my one-man show,

05:51.656 --> 05:54.360
Jo Jo Dancer, Ihr Leben Ruft!

05:54.394 --> 05:56.963
- Oh... [muttering]
- Dude, is that blackface?

05:56.995 --> 05:59.466
- Yep! - Whoa!
- What the shit, man?

05:59.499 --> 06:01.835
But you have to hypnotize each of us,

06:01.867 --> 06:04.036
- everybody here in the office?
- Yep, yep, yep!

06:04.069 --> 06:06.139
- Okay. Then you're on.
- Sweet!

06:06.172 --> 06:08.508
- Wait, what?
- Yes! He said everybody.

06:08.540 --> 06:10.810
[Malory] Who do I
have to murder around here

06:10.843 --> 06:13.379
to get this damn thing to make ice?

06:13.413 --> 06:15.448
- [exclaims in German]
- [cackling]

06:15.480 --> 06:16.783
- [droning]
- Whoa!

06:16.815 --> 06:18.217
- [gasps]
- What is happening?

06:18.250 --> 06:19.985
- God!
- Oh, I gotta go!

06:20.019 --> 06:22.355
- [screams]
- [droning continues]

06:22.387 --> 06:24.356
- They gone?
- Yep.

06:24.389 --> 06:26.860
[exhales] So, then, to repeat,

06:26.892 --> 06:30.996
I demand immunity from this idiotic
Jo Jo Dancer bullshit.

06:31.029 --> 06:33.332
Dang! You don't have to be hurtful.

06:33.365 --> 06:36.468
I feel like I do. And how do you
think you're gonna pull this off?

06:36.502 --> 06:38.872
Scopolamine, the zombie drug.

06:38.904 --> 06:41.306
What? Are you kidding me?

06:41.339 --> 06:42.709
Ugh! Are you?

06:42.742 --> 06:44.377
[Slater] Man, Veronica Deane.

06:44.410 --> 06:46.579
- Remember her in Shanghai Moon?
- Oh, my God.

06:46.612 --> 06:47.881
- That dress?
- Right?

06:47.913 --> 06:49.481
Yeah. Tell him how you kissed her.

06:49.514 --> 06:51.584
- What?
- First of all, she kissed me.

06:51.617 --> 06:54.153
- My ass!
- My mouth. Wait.

06:54.187 --> 06:56.423
I mean... And I
thought we were over that.

06:56.456 --> 06:58.223
Well, apparently you're not.

06:58.257 --> 07:00.427
I didn't cast her in Deadly Velvet.

07:00.459 --> 07:02.129
Which, do you think they're currently

07:02.154 --> 07:03.930
in principal photography on that, or...

07:03.963 --> 07:06.043
I think it's neither the time nor the

07:06.068 --> 07:08.068
place nor the Slater to discuss it!

07:08.101 --> 07:09.668
I'm not the one who brought it up!

07:09.701 --> 07:11.504
- You are exactly the one!
- First of all...

07:11.536 --> 07:15.340
Could you both please shut up
and do what I hired you to do?

07:15.374 --> 07:17.444
Which, if you already
knew Hinkins was here...

07:17.476 --> 07:18.902
He's not. But there's somebody up

07:18.927 --> 07:20.412
there who should know where he is.

07:20.446 --> 07:22.615
- Yeah, Lana. Ow!
- [sighs]

07:22.648 --> 07:26.019
Archer, your
professionalism never ceases to amaze me.

07:26.052 --> 07:28.021
[gasps] You know what's amazing?

07:28.053 --> 07:32.158
Magnets! Especially for
dumb idiots like you.

07:39.008 --> 07:40.142
[Archer] Okay, what's this guy's name?

07:40.176 --> 07:42.111
Eckerd. But follow my lead in there.

07:42.145 --> 07:44.647
We gotta take it real easy. These
ex-ULTRA guys are really jumpy, so...

07:44.680 --> 07:47.784
Hey, Eckerd, come move your
goddamn car outta my spot,

07:47.817 --> 07:49.319
- you bug-eyed son of a...
- [rifle fires]

07:49.351 --> 07:51.421
- Hey!
- Now who's the idiot?

07:51.454 --> 07:52.822
- [rifle fires]
- Whoo!

07:52.854 --> 07:54.423
He asked, idiotly.

07:54.457 --> 07:55.992
Wait, wait, wait!

07:56.024 --> 07:57.594
- [thudding, glass shatters]
- Damn it!

07:57.626 --> 08:00.129
Holy shit!

08:00.162 --> 08:01.964
- [grunting]
- Stop it!

08:01.998 --> 08:03.399
- [Slater] Eckerd!
- [gasps] Slater!

08:03.431 --> 08:05.134
It's okay. We just wanna talk.

08:05.168 --> 08:07.504
Yeah, the gun's just
a conversation piece.

08:07.536 --> 08:10.339
[Pam] What? Bluntz & Blintzen?

08:10.373 --> 08:13.076
Nice try, Krieger. Who
am I, the Road Runner?

08:13.108 --> 08:16.311
Although if this is for
real, I'll never forgive myself.

08:16.345 --> 08:19.115
Goddamn it, this better not be a ruse!

08:19.148 --> 08:21.851
All right. There better be some damn...

08:21.884 --> 08:23.753
[sputters, spits] What the...

08:23.785 --> 08:26.655
[heart beating]

08:26.688 --> 08:27.856
Huh.

08:27.890 --> 08:30.025
- Pamela.
- Yes, Doctor.

08:30.058 --> 08:32.428
You are under my complete control.

08:32.461 --> 08:35.532
- Yes, Doctor.
- Tell Cheryl to come in here.

08:35.563 --> 08:37.599
Hey, neck-bird, come here a second!

08:37.631 --> 08:40.635
Ugh! Why? Shut up! Why?

08:40.669 --> 08:42.398
Uh, there's a mouse caught in

08:42.423 --> 08:44.306
a trap, and he's still alive,

08:44.340 --> 08:46.176
but his tiny little back's broken!

08:46.208 --> 08:48.178
Where? Show me. I wanna see it. Where?

08:48.211 --> 08:49.178
Eww!

08:49.212 --> 08:51.514
[heart beating]

08:51.547 --> 08:53.349
Huh.

08:53.381 --> 08:56.051
- Cheryl.
- Yes, Doctor.

08:56.085 --> 08:58.021
Boolean search, hypnosis,

08:58.053 --> 09:00.890
and how to defend against, yes?

09:00.923 --> 09:02.792
[Pam, Cheryl] Hey, Cyril, come here!

09:02.824 --> 09:04.059
Why? Shut up! Why?

09:04.092 --> 09:06.361
[Pam] Uh, we found Lana's diary!

09:06.395 --> 09:08.430
[Cheryl] And it's all about your dong!

09:09.832 --> 09:11.366
[together] Yes, Doctor.

09:11.399 --> 09:13.702
See? Easy peasy zombie squeezy.

09:13.736 --> 09:15.506
You still gotta get Ms. Archer, and

09:15.531 --> 09:17.472
she's not a candy-ass like these ones.

09:17.505 --> 09:19.143
She's 80 pounds. This stuff

09:19.168 --> 09:20.842
could paralyze a gorilla.

09:20.875 --> 09:22.812
- [whispers] On angel dust.
- [Malory] Wha...

09:22.845 --> 09:24.880
I better not smell marijuana!

09:24.914 --> 09:26.515
Here we go, here we go, here we go!

09:26.548 --> 09:31.020
I swear to God, you people, the...

09:31.053 --> 09:32.020
Huh.

09:32.053 --> 09:34.323
- Malory.
- Yes, Doctor.

09:34.356 --> 09:37.159
- You are under my... Ow!
- You son of a...

09:37.193 --> 09:39.996
- [grunting]
- Are you out of your mind?

09:40.029 --> 09:42.030
- What is wrong with you?
- Oh-ho-ho!

09:42.063 --> 09:44.099
Walk in here with you
idiots smoking reefers

09:44.132 --> 09:46.602
like a bunch of
yardbirds, and you spritz me?

09:46.635 --> 09:48.704
- You spritz me?
- [grunting continues]

09:48.737 --> 09:51.907
<i>- Well, let me tell you something, Herr Doktor!
- Oh!</i>

09:51.941 --> 09:54.210
I killed seven Krauts with a shovel,

09:54.242 --> 09:57.012
so one more beardy son
of a bitch like you

09:57.045 --> 10:00.882
- won't make a damn bit of difference!
- [screams]

10:00.915 --> 10:02.284
- [clears throat]
- [whimpering]

10:02.318 --> 10:03.620
And you!

10:03.653 --> 10:06.222
Any questions, little Miss Blintzen?

10:06.255 --> 10:07.756
- [rattling]
- [squeaky] Mm-mm.

10:07.789 --> 10:09.759
And when I get back from lunch,

10:09.792 --> 10:12.462
you people had better be hard at work!

10:14.929 --> 10:17.599
[coughing]

10:17.632 --> 10:19.234
I told your dumb ass...

10:19.268 --> 10:21.104
[inhales sharply] Yep.

10:21.136 --> 10:23.472
Back in ten minutes. Be ready.

10:23.505 --> 10:26.275
Ow, ow, ow, ow. [grunts]

10:26.308 --> 10:29.077
Ow, ow, ow, ow. [grunts]

10:29.111 --> 10:31.114
Eckerd, I'm not gonna ask you again.

10:31.146 --> 10:34.082
- Good, because I'm not gonna tell you.
- Yes, you are.

10:34.116 --> 10:36.552
So, how'd you know this
wasn't a combat shotgun,

10:36.585 --> 10:38.321
with, say, five rounds in the tube?

10:38.353 --> 10:41.056
- How would I know that?
- So you just barged in?

10:41.090 --> 10:42.703
What am I gonna do, Lana, stand out

10:42.728 --> 10:44.226
in the hall the rest of my life?

10:44.260 --> 10:45.428
- [Slater] One.
- [gun cocks]

10:45.461 --> 10:47.630
- I...
- Two. Eckerd, I'm serious.

10:47.663 --> 10:49.966
- It's got real bullets and everything.
- I...

10:49.999 --> 10:52.068
I don't care. I won't tell you.

10:52.101 --> 10:54.003
Slater, is that really necessary?

10:54.035 --> 10:55.275
Actually, no. Could you grab me

10:55.286 --> 10:56.606
a pitcher of water and a towel?

10:56.639 --> 10:58.608
Wait! No, no! No! No!

10:58.640 --> 11:01.276
No, no, no! Stop, stop,
stop! Okay, okay, okay.

11:01.309 --> 11:03.445
Please. I'll tell you where he is.

11:03.478 --> 11:04.946
- Wait, what?
- I'm waiting.

11:04.980 --> 11:06.849
He didn't even pour any water on you.

11:06.881 --> 11:09.017
Yeah, and he's not going to.

11:09.050 --> 11:11.050
Hinkins is at the Tuntford Arms,

11:11.075 --> 11:13.488
room 302, under the name "Swenders."

11:13.521 --> 11:15.590
- Okay, we can be there...
- Wait a minute.

11:15.624 --> 11:17.505
You give up your buddy just because some

11:17.530 --> 11:19.295
dickhead threatens to waterboard you?

11:19.327 --> 11:21.997
- Yes!
- Are you... How bad could it be?

11:22.030 --> 11:24.000
- What? Are you kidding?
- Archer, it's...

11:24.033 --> 11:25.435
- Wait. You wait.
- What?

11:25.467 --> 11:27.703
How have you never been waterboarded?

11:27.736 --> 11:29.005
- Why would I?
- What?

11:29.038 --> 11:30.773
Gee, I don't know. Training?

11:30.805 --> 11:32.107
- [chuckles] What?
- Oh, my...

11:32.140 --> 11:33.709
Archer, we all had to...

11:33.742 --> 11:36.878
- Where were you on waterboarding day?
- Uh...

11:36.912 --> 11:39.982
No, no, no, no! Wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait!

11:40.015 --> 11:42.184
I think I'm supposed to be somewhere.

11:42.217 --> 11:44.755
But I also think I want the lavender

11:44.780 --> 11:47.155
instead of the sandalwood. Right?

11:47.188 --> 11:48.890
- Oh, who remembers?
- I do.

11:48.923 --> 11:50.992
I remember exactly where I was, Archer.

11:51.025 --> 11:52.266
I was strapped to a board and so

11:52.291 --> 11:53.662
convinced I was actually drowning

11:53.696 --> 11:55.064
that I shit my sweatpants.

11:55.097 --> 11:57.332
- Wait. Not...
- Yes! Literally!

11:57.366 --> 11:59.968
- Well, that sounds terrible.
- It is terrible.

12:00.001 --> 12:01.973
I can't believe you weaseled out of it.

12:01.998 --> 12:03.205
That is so classic you!

12:03.239 --> 12:05.408
[chuckles] Yeah, right? Pretty great.

12:05.441 --> 12:07.343
So, should we go, or do you need to

12:07.368 --> 12:09.245
bungle the invasion of Cuba first?

12:09.278 --> 12:11.013
Mm, no. We've got a few minutes.

12:11.045 --> 12:13.415
- [cocks]
- So get on the table, idiot.

12:13.448 --> 12:16.084
[chuckles] Exqueeze me?

12:16.117 --> 12:17.719
You heard him.

12:17.752 --> 12:19.254
No, but seriously, don't feel bad

12:19.288 --> 12:20.890
when I'm totally unfazed by this.

12:20.923 --> 12:22.524
Yeah, again, it's not gonna be

12:22.558 --> 12:24.927
like some homoerotic prep-school swirlie.

12:24.960 --> 12:27.697
Yeah, they were kind of oddly sexual.

12:27.730 --> 12:29.699
Gonna just leave that there? Lana?

12:29.731 --> 12:31.166
With pleasure.

12:31.199 --> 12:33.568
Plus, I bet this only affects women.

12:33.601 --> 12:36.539
- Really?
- Well, you know, people with vaginas.

12:36.572 --> 12:39.674
- Uh-huh.
- However you choose to self-identify.

12:39.707 --> 12:42.077
[sighs] God, I'm going to enjoy this.

12:42.111 --> 12:45.114
[laughs] Well, I know you
like putting stuff in guys' mouths.

12:45.146 --> 12:46.548
- You finished?
- [laughs]

12:46.582 --> 12:48.885
I bet you ask guys that a lot.

12:48.918 --> 12:50.887
- [clears throat]
- Aah!

12:50.919 --> 12:52.889
And then clear your throat!

12:52.922 --> 12:55.558
Okay. All right. I'm
ready. Let's do this.

12:55.591 --> 12:57.868
And just to
reiterate, waterboarding will

12:57.893 --> 12:59.928
not affect me in any way whatsoever.

12:59.962 --> 13:03.600
[clears throat] And,
also, you have a vagina.

13:09.256 --> 13:13.535
[stammering] I didn't know
it... it would be like that.

13:13.568 --> 13:16.738
I mean, you... you...
you... you hear about it,

13:16.772 --> 13:19.208
and you hear people say
it's bad, but you think,

13:19.240 --> 13:22.010
"Oh, those people probably
have vaginas."

13:22.043 --> 13:25.581
But I don't have a
vagina! But as God is my witness,

13:25.614 --> 13:29.752
that was the worst thing I've
ever experienced in my...

13:29.784 --> 13:32.087
Wait a minute! I've
actually drowned before!

13:32.120 --> 13:33.873
Literally drowned! I was actually

13:33.898 --> 13:35.523
clinically dead from drowning!

13:35.557 --> 13:36.868
Which, looking back, I'm kind

13:36.893 --> 13:38.360
of surprised I didn't remember

13:38.393 --> 13:41.797
when I was joking about everybody
having vaginas, but...

13:41.830 --> 13:43.898
- Lana...
- No-o-o-o!

13:43.932 --> 13:45.467
No, no, no, no, no.

13:45.500 --> 13:47.870
Do not speak to me. You
have said quite enough.

13:47.903 --> 13:50.572
Yeah, but I... Oh, come on, Lana.

13:50.605 --> 13:52.490
It is a proven fact that torture makes

13:52.515 --> 13:54.375
you say what your captors wanna hear.

13:54.408 --> 13:56.778
I don't think she wanted to
hear about how you've been struggling

13:56.812 --> 13:58.098
with what you truly believe are

13:58.123 --> 13:59.715
genuine feelings for Veronica Deane.

13:59.748 --> 14:01.450
- I...
- Speaking of vaginas...

14:01.482 --> 14:03.418
- Were we?
- Ughhh!

14:03.451 --> 14:05.421
Oh, my God, I'm such a fatty.

14:05.453 --> 14:07.288
[Krieger] Ray! Ray, come in here!

14:07.321 --> 14:08.724
Why? Shut up! Why?

14:08.756 --> 14:10.992
[Malory] Because he said
so, you little snot!

14:11.025 --> 14:12.427
- [plate shatters]
- Uh...

14:12.461 --> 14:14.730
- Coming!
- [Krieger] And bring the others!

14:14.763 --> 14:16.966
- [imitating dogs]
- Well, y'all heard the man. Come on!

14:16.999 --> 14:18.300
[together] Yes, Ray.

14:18.332 --> 14:19.934
[panting] Sorry.

14:19.967 --> 14:22.003
- I was putting away the blintzes.
- I bet.

14:22.037 --> 14:24.440
- Silence, woman.
- Yes, Doctor.

14:24.472 --> 14:26.407
How did you, um...

14:26.441 --> 14:28.476
Oh, uh, just gave her another spritz.

14:28.509 --> 14:30.111
- What the...
- [imitating dogs]

14:30.144 --> 14:31.980
- Why are they crawling?
- Oh, sorry.

14:32.014 --> 14:34.115
I turned them into little, wiggly pugs.

14:34.148 --> 14:36.317
It's okay. I was gonna do that, too.

14:36.350 --> 14:38.854
Hey, no! Save it for the camera.

14:38.887 --> 14:40.510
All righty, I guess let's get 'em

14:40.535 --> 14:42.324
stripped down to their unterpantzen.

14:42.356 --> 14:44.003
[Lana] As a matter of fact, why don't

14:44.028 --> 14:45.693
you just call her up and ask her out?

14:45.726 --> 14:46.494
Lana...

14:46.519 --> 14:48.797
Take her to the Brown
Derby for the early-bird special,

14:48.830 --> 14:50.633
get her some chicken croquettes.

14:50.666 --> 14:52.368
Oh, oh, oh, and some sherbet!

14:52.400 --> 14:54.135
- Old people love sherbet!
- [elevator bell dings]

14:54.168 --> 14:55.603
She's, like, 50.

14:55.637 --> 14:56.872
Million!

14:56.904 --> 14:59.607
[scoffs] Doesn't even make sense.

14:59.640 --> 15:01.776
Oh, and how old is Ellis Crane?

15:01.810 --> 15:03.646
Moot! The question is moot,

15:03.678 --> 15:05.648
because I didn't make
out with Ellis Crane!

15:05.681 --> 15:07.682
Hey, guys, as much as I'm loving this,

15:07.716 --> 15:10.818
- what say we focus on the mission here?
- I am focused, Slater!

15:10.851 --> 15:13.021
But once we find this
Hinkins guy, you can just...

15:13.054 --> 15:14.656
- Whoa! Son of a...
- Jesus!

15:14.690 --> 15:16.192
[sighs] You were saying?

15:16.225 --> 15:18.860
Hinkins! Hinkins, wait! Damn it!

15:18.894 --> 15:21.297
I'll take the lobby. You two
take that stairwell to the roof.

15:21.330 --> 15:24.166
- Move, move, move, move!
- Who died and made you hall monitor?

15:24.198 --> 15:26.101
Oh, shut up and come on!

15:27.866 --> 15:29.738
- He's going up!
- Why are you still talking?

15:29.770 --> 15:31.873
Well, that's a good question, Lana,

15:31.907 --> 15:33.504
because obviously you can't have a

15:33.529 --> 15:35.009
mature conversation about this.

15:35.043 --> 15:37.513
- And I know you like 'em mature!
- Case in point!

15:37.546 --> 15:40.049
- And, gee, I wonder why that is.
- Lana!

15:40.081 --> 15:42.551
Paging Dr. Freud! Dr. Sigmund

15:42.584 --> 15:44.081
"Oh, By The Way, Deep Down, I

15:44.106 --> 15:45.888
Really Wanna Plow My Mom" Freud!

15:45.921 --> 15:47.556
[laughs] That's not even...

15:47.589 --> 15:50.059
I didn't even say that while
I was being waterboarded.

15:50.091 --> 15:51.559
Well, you... [gasps]

15:51.592 --> 15:53.361
Oh, shit. Hinkins, wait!

15:53.394 --> 15:55.997
[Lana] Wait! No, no,
no! Don't move! We can...

15:56.030 --> 15:59.767
You can tell Slater and the rest
of those vampires at the agency

15:59.801 --> 16:01.836
that ULTRA doesn't end with me!

16:01.870 --> 16:05.441
It can never end, you see!
It's a... It's a Mobius strip!

16:05.474 --> 16:08.410
An endless ticker
tape, and we are the data!

16:08.435 --> 16:09.845
The tiny pinholes...

16:09.878 --> 16:11.946
Yeah, good, keep him talking.

16:11.980 --> 16:14.352
I'm gonna sneak up on him from the side.

16:14.377 --> 16:15.683
The... Wait, what?

16:15.716 --> 16:16.716
- to kill me...

Huh? [yelling]

- [body thuds]
- [car alarm blaring]

16:22.758 --> 16:25.628
That was your plan?

16:25.661 --> 16:27.630
Well, you didn't even have one.

16:27.663 --> 16:30.099
Sometimes doing nothing is a plan!

16:30.131 --> 16:31.911
And... spoiler alert... nothing is what

16:31.936 --> 16:33.735
you should've done with Veronica Deane,

16:33.769 --> 16:38.539
instead of that pathetic
little fanboy make-out session at the...

16:38.572 --> 16:39.574
Ugh!

16:39.607 --> 16:42.411
For [bleep]'s sake!

16:42.443 --> 16:44.879
- Archer.
- Hmm? What? What are we doing?

16:44.913 --> 16:47.316
- Oh, I'll tell you what we're doing.
- [door opens]

16:47.348 --> 16:51.419
Does it involve scraping a CIA
asset off the roof of a Datsun Honey Bee?

16:51.452 --> 16:53.055
[chuckles] Man, I hope not.

16:53.087 --> 16:55.191
- [grunting]
- [cocks]

16:58.326 --> 17:00.796
Uh, yeah. So, here's the thing here...

17:00.828 --> 17:03.164
The thing here is
that I am not paying you!

17:03.198 --> 17:06.067
- That's the thing here!
- What the shit, Slater?

17:06.101 --> 17:07.689
I mean, maybe it didn't end well for

17:07.714 --> 17:09.405
Hinkins, if it was even supposed to...

17:09.438 --> 17:12.107
But either way, nobody got assassinated.

17:12.140 --> 17:15.009
Yeah, good point. But, funny story,

17:15.041 --> 17:17.811
I wasn't gonna pay you anyway, so...

17:17.846 --> 17:20.214
♪ ♪

17:23.451 --> 17:25.621
- ♪ Slater ♪
- [door closes]

17:25.653 --> 17:28.324
Huh. Well, the good news is...

17:28.356 --> 17:29.490
- Shh.
- What?

17:29.524 --> 17:31.126
Shh, shush, shush, shush.

17:31.159 --> 17:33.295
- Do you hear that?
- What?

17:33.327 --> 17:36.699
That sound. I think it's the break.

17:36.731 --> 17:38.200
The what? What... What brake?

17:38.232 --> 17:39.969
The break that we're on!

17:45.307 --> 17:46.842
Oh. [chuckles]

17:46.874 --> 17:48.977
Okay. Now I get it.

17:49.009 --> 17:50.506
I thought she was talking about the

17:50.531 --> 17:51.879
brakes on the Datsun Honey Bee.

17:51.913 --> 17:54.216
But, uh...

17:54.249 --> 17:56.085
nope.

18:02.657 --> 18:04.489
[Cyril groaning]

18:04.522 --> 18:06.825
Oh, my head.

18:06.858 --> 18:08.525
[groans]

18:08.559 --> 18:10.662
Hey, where the heck are my pants?

18:10.695 --> 18:13.831
[exhales] Pants,
hell. Where's that damn cat?

18:13.865 --> 18:15.233
Ugh! What cat?

18:15.265 --> 18:17.936
The one that shit in
my mouth. [spitting]

18:17.968 --> 18:20.170
And that may or may not be a metaphor.

18:20.204 --> 18:22.674
Well, this sure as hell isn't.

18:22.706 --> 18:25.109
<i>- [whimpering]
- [growling]</i>

18:25.142 --> 18:26.744
<i>[Krieger] Yep, yep, yep! Okay.</i>

18:26.777 --> 18:28.345
<i>Now you're all birds of prey.</i>

18:28.379 --> 18:29.914
<i>[all squawking]</i>

18:29.946 --> 18:32.516
Ja! Und Cyril ist Der Falkonmeister!

18:32.550 --> 18:35.453
Ja, ja! Untzergrabben! Untzergrabben!

18:35.485 --> 18:37.703
Oh, my God! You are hands down the

18:37.728 --> 18:39.858
world's shittiest Falkonmeister.

18:39.890 --> 18:41.859
What? I don't even remember that.

18:41.892 --> 18:43.460
You don't have to. It's on tape.

18:43.494 --> 18:46.030
<i>So now we gotta go see Jo Jo Dancer.</i>

18:46.062 --> 18:48.398
Which better be as racist as it looks.

18:48.432 --> 18:51.202
And you're not, like, hungover, or...

18:51.234 --> 18:53.404
- Why would I be?
- No, I mean you wouldn't,

18:53.436 --> 18:55.355
especially if you weren't exposed to

18:55.380 --> 18:57.274
scopolamine or something like that.

18:57.308 --> 19:00.378
Scopolamine? Why would I have been?

19:00.410 --> 19:02.647
I... No, yeah, no... I... You know, I...

19:02.679 --> 19:05.149
Yeah, exactly. Why?

19:05.183 --> 19:08.219
And more importantly, how?

19:08.252 --> 19:10.821
[Krieger] Okay,
that's... Oh, come on. Stop it.

19:10.854 --> 19:12.641
That's just about enough of... What...

19:12.666 --> 19:13.924
Well, that does it, missy!

19:13.957 --> 19:16.827
- You can just cool your jets in there.
- Yes, Doctor.

19:16.860 --> 19:20.430
And by "jets," obviously I
mean your actual cooling jets, so...

19:20.464 --> 19:21.633
Yes, Doctor.

19:21.666 --> 19:23.467
So, yeah, just cool your jets...

19:23.501 --> 19:25.670
Oh, and as for the rest of you...

19:25.703 --> 19:27.200
Now that I think about it, let's

19:27.225 --> 19:29.072
everybody cool their respective jets.

19:29.106 --> 19:30.407
[whirring]

19:30.440 --> 19:33.143
Excellent. Yes.

19:33.177 --> 19:35.312
Yes, very good.

19:36.379 --> 19:38.716
Well, short term, anyway.

19:42.853 --> 19:44.021

19:44.054 --> 19:46.291
