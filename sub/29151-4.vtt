00:08.950 --> 00:10.718
You're joining the Army?

00:10.795 --> 00:12.002
I'm a translator.

00:12.079 --> 00:13.429
I won't see any combat.

00:14.632 --> 00:15.740
Asako-san!

00:15.742 --> 00:18.392
Henry-san, he's here!

00:18.469 --> 00:21.044
I brought you some warm water
to soak your hands and feet.

00:22.457 --> 00:23.664
She's just trying to help!

00:25.126 --> 00:28.243
I never used to believe in
that old-country stuff.

00:28.245 --> 00:30.646
Yurei be anywhere
you go.

00:30.723 --> 00:32.555
It follow you.

<i>You'll be glad to hear
I'm far from the action...</i>

00:49.817 --> 00:52.334

00:52.336 --> 00:55.912

01:25.703 --> 01:29.688
<i>That's when I think of you.</i>

01:29.690 --> 01:32.207
<i>I'm not saying it's better
back at camp,</i>

01:32.209 --> 01:35.436

it's calmer.</i>

<i>After Yoshida-san
and Furuya-san,</i>

01:38.366 --> 01:40.433

01:42.053 --> 01:44.778

03:24.080 --> 03:26.805
<i>I really ought to be
writing two letters.</i>

03:26.807 --> 03:30.084
<i>Some days I'm so proud of
how smart and brave you are</i>

03:42.281 --> 03:45.324

<i>"Did I ever tell you
when I was little</i>

04:10.868 --> 04:12.460
<i>I used to
sneak out of my house</i>

04:12.462 --> 04:14.353
<i>and look in
the neighbor's window?</i>

04:14.355 --> 04:17.464
<i>I'd see them
sitting at the table.</i>

04:17.466 --> 04:20.301
<i>They were a big family,
not like mine,</i>

04:20.303 --> 04:22.043
<i>and I remember,</i>

04:22.046 --> 04:23.770
<i>they always looked like</i>

04:23.772 --> 04:25.473
<i>what I thought a family
should look like.</i>

04:25.475 --> 04:27.123
<i>Together.</i>

04:27.125 --> 04:28.884
<i>That's me these days.</i>

04:28.886 --> 04:31.479
<i>Watching
a Japanese family of 9,000</i>

04:31.481 --> 04:33.597
<i>through their window.</i>

04:33.599 --> 04:35.891
<i>I'm not laying this
at your feet.</i>

04:35.893 --> 04:38.301
<i>Honestly.</i>

04:38.303 --> 04:41.730
<i>In fact, you're my best hope.</i>

04:41.732 --> 04:43.324
<i>Someday, it'll be us,</i>

04:43.326 --> 04:45.659
<i>and our baby,</i>

04:45.661 --> 04:47.886
<i>on our little acre,</i>

04:47.888 --> 04:52.333

on the inside of that window."</i>

04:57.673 --> 04:58.989
See anything?

04:58.991 --> 05:00.049
Nothing. You?

05:01.418 --> 05:04.160
Still nothing
on Admiral Takahashi.

05:04.162 --> 05:05.513
But they'd never
mention him by name,

05:05.515 --> 05:07.056
right?

05:09.185 --> 05:10.434
Did you sleep at all?

05:16.859 --> 05:18.567
I thought you were
supposed to be... good.

05:20.178 --> 05:22.512
I wasn't going for art.

05:22.514 --> 05:24.273
I...

05:24.275 --> 05:26.200
I thought I saw something
out there.

05:26.202 --> 05:27.201
Like the enemy?

05:27.203 --> 05:29.278
Man, a camera flash
is a sure way

05:29.280 --> 05:30.538
to get us sent home
in a pine box.

05:30.540 --> 05:31.372
No, it's not that.

05:31.374 --> 05:32.998
It's...

05:37.438 --> 05:40.047
Ogawa...

05:40.049 --> 05:42.049
you ever hear of a thing
called a <i>yurei?</i>

05:43.294 --> 05:44.626
Yeah, well,

05:44.628 --> 05:46.962
just what I read from
those old <i>Kaidan</i> stories.

05:46.964 --> 05:48.222
Why? Are you
ghost-hunting now?

05:50.059 --> 05:51.784
Just...

05:51.786 --> 05:56.046
from what you've read
in those stories,

05:56.048 --> 05:58.548
what's a <i>yurei</i> usually after?

05:58.550 --> 06:00.501
Depends on its <i>onnen.</i>

06:00.503 --> 06:03.028
It's like a crazed
hunger for something.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.572
Maybe somebody wronged
it in its lifetime.

06:04.574 --> 06:05.647
Whatever it is,

06:05.649 --> 06:06.648
it spends
the rest of eternity

06:06.650 --> 06:08.367
trying to satisfy
its <i>onnen.</i>

06:11.080 --> 06:12.988
Can a <i>yurei...</i>

06:12.990 --> 06:15.957
control other people?

06:15.959 --> 06:17.418
You know it's not
real, right?

06:19.071 --> 06:21.330
Tell that to
the Japanese soldiers.

06:21.332 --> 06:22.405
It seems like
every other letter

06:22.407 --> 06:24.091
is about a spirit of some kind.

06:27.338 --> 06:28.804
I thought I weighed
that down.

06:38.165 --> 06:39.690
Ogawa...

06:41.685 --> 06:42.943
you ever seen this before?

06:44.614 --> 06:46.947
No wonder the wind's
been whistling through.

06:46.949 --> 06:48.690
Something...

06:48.692 --> 06:50.175
tore it open.

06:50.177 --> 06:52.511
Like a crocodile?

06:52.513 --> 06:55.289
Or are you still on
about the <i>yurei?</i>

07:09.639 --> 07:11.972
Yeah, it's moving.

07:11.974 --> 07:12.973
I can feel it.

07:20.374 --> 07:22.541
Yeah.

07:22.543 --> 07:24.226
I'm a bit sad.

07:24.228 --> 07:26.320
The baby's father?

07:26.322 --> 07:27.729
He's far away.

07:27.731 --> 07:30.157
Oh.

07:30.159 --> 07:31.717
Baby.

07:31.719 --> 07:32.826
Happy.

07:35.665 --> 07:37.289
I hope so.

07:45.007 --> 07:46.173
Uh, I should get going.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.393
What's that?

08:21.693 --> 08:23.544
<i>Arigato.</i>

08:27.458 --> 08:28.340
<i>Arigato.</i>

08:38.510 --> 08:40.043
Colonel Stallings
is asking for you

08:40.044 --> 08:41.602
up at the main camp.

09:29.503 --> 09:30.502
Colonel?

09:30.504 --> 09:32.020
Sergeant Ogawa.

09:32.022 --> 09:34.172
Sergeant Nakayama.

09:34.174 --> 09:35.765
I thought it might be
time for you to see

09:35.767 --> 09:37.509
where your documents
are coming from.

09:50.782 --> 09:53.099
What happened?

09:53.101 --> 09:55.377
Men die all day long
out here.

09:55.379 --> 09:56.637
There's so much
that can kill you.

09:56.639 --> 09:57.938
Malaria, cholera,

09:57.940 --> 10:00.440
all kinds of
sand flies.

10:03.037 --> 10:05.128
How about
a bullet to the head?

10:05.130 --> 10:07.205
Did the sand flies do that?

10:07.207 --> 10:08.356
You got any idea

10:08.358 --> 10:09.950
what your people do
to our guys?

10:09.952 --> 10:11.543
My people are your people.

10:11.545 --> 10:14.062
Easy, Matthis.

10:14.064 --> 10:15.897
Colonel Stallings thinks
these Orientals

10:15.899 --> 10:17.791
might be able help us find
Sergeant Crittenden.

10:17.793 --> 10:19.401
Lieutenant Oury's men

10:19.403 --> 10:20.886
have been in
a pretty nasty skirmish

10:20.888 --> 10:22.220
with one of
Admiral Takahashi's units

10:22.222 --> 10:24.222
by the Matanikau River.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.667
I didn't realize how nasty
until I saw this.

10:26.669 --> 10:28.168
I figured it was time
we worked hand-in-hand

10:28.170 --> 10:29.086
for a change.

10:31.548 --> 10:33.139
How long's the battle
been going?

10:33.141 --> 10:35.417
On and off for months,

10:35.419 --> 10:36.585
but it didn't get nasty

10:36.587 --> 10:38.512
till six days ago.

10:40.299 --> 10:42.257
That's when we lost
Sergeant Crittenden.

10:42.259 --> 10:44.259
He went missing on a recon.

10:44.261 --> 10:45.577
We took back
a dozen of theirs,

10:45.579 --> 10:47.345
but still no sign.

10:47.347 --> 10:49.081
Your Colonel says maybe
there's something in the pile

10:49.083 --> 10:50.248
that can help track him down.

10:50.250 --> 10:53.252
Do you know
if Crittenden's alive?

10:53.254 --> 10:55.195
We don't.

10:55.197 --> 10:57.923
Sometimes the Japs
execute prisoners.

10:57.925 --> 10:59.258
Sometimes
they keep them alive

10:59.260 --> 11:01.535
and do a lot worse.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.520
You know, if your men
weren't so busy

11:04.522 --> 11:06.448
making letter-openers
out of shin bones,

11:06.450 --> 11:08.876
they might have realized
that a live POW

11:08.878 --> 11:10.193
would stand a better chance
of telling us

11:10.195 --> 11:11.753
where your sergeant is.

11:11.755 --> 11:13.463
Maybe even get us
to Takahashi.

11:15.442 --> 11:18.368
Is this boy supposed to be
a translator or an officer?

11:18.370 --> 11:20.929
Work with what
you got, Nakayama.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.008
Not everything's
written on paper.

12:23.010 --> 12:26.695
It's Wabun code.

12:28.515 --> 12:30.015
Told ya, Oury.

12:30.017 --> 12:33.702
One of my Japanese boys
is worth ten of yours.

12:33.704 --> 12:35.796
Better get back in there
and see what else you missed.

12:36.799 --> 12:38.465
You heard the Colonel.

12:39.951 --> 12:41.218
Get in there!
Chop-chop!

13:08.738 --> 13:11.999
<i>"So you asked
what it's like here.</i>

13:12.001 --> 13:15.076
<i>It'd be a tropical paradise
if nature could have its way,</i>

13:15.078 --> 13:18.839
<i>but apparently, it can't.</i>

13:18.841 --> 13:22.234
<i>It's nice to hear
everything's okay over there,</i>

13:22.236 --> 13:24.403
<i>that nothing crazy's happened.</i>

13:24.405 --> 13:26.571
<i>I was hoping not.</i>

13:26.573 --> 13:29.758
<i>I'm including a little
something for you.</i>

13:29.760 --> 13:33.261
<i>Maybe it'll make up for my dad
being such a pain in the rear.</i>

13:33.263 --> 13:34.471
<i>He's kind of stubborn,</i>

13:34.473 --> 13:38.099
<i>but then again, so are you.</i>

13:38.101 --> 13:40.819
<i>Don't try to do too much.</i>

13:40.821 --> 13:43.422
<i>I can't wait to see our baby.</i>

13:43.424 --> 13:45.157
<i>I hope he gets your looks."</i>

13:46.468 --> 13:47.909
What does he say?

13:49.204 --> 13:50.612
He's good.

13:50.614 --> 13:52.664
A lot of names
are cut out.

13:53.709 --> 13:55.500
He sent this.

14:02.384 --> 14:04.609
So handsome.

14:04.611 --> 14:05.761
Like Gary Cooper.

14:08.382 --> 14:09.181
Oto-san.

14:20.652 --> 14:22.811
I suppose there is
a part of you

14:22.813 --> 14:24.446
that still thinks of him
as a little boy.

14:26.224 --> 14:29.201
He is his own man now.

14:40.071 --> 14:41.046
The baby?

14:50.766 --> 14:52.432
Don't be scared.

14:56.754 --> 14:57.846
Did Chester tell you

14:57.848 --> 15:01.015
about my mom?

15:01.017 --> 15:02.651
You need to think
good thoughts.

15:09.767 --> 15:12.994
How was it when you
gave birth to Chester?

15:14.698 --> 15:17.940
Oh... I don't remember.

15:17.942 --> 15:20.961
It was so long ago.

15:52.810 --> 15:54.161
Hello?

16:03.246 --> 16:04.963
This section's off limits.

16:32.500 --> 16:34.367
Hey, you.

16:34.369 --> 16:35.994
Do you understand
English?

17:18.396 --> 17:21.248
Nessler!

17:21.250 --> 17:22.323
Nessler, where you been?

17:22.325 --> 17:24.209
You missed your last shift!

17:26.362 --> 17:28.796
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

17:28.798 --> 17:31.716
Nessler, get down
from there right now!

17:34.379 --> 17:36.488
Nessler, get your ass down here
right now!

17:51.688 --> 17:54.072
Jesus...

18:18.365 --> 18:20.765
Which one of you Japs
got him drunk?

18:59.330 --> 19:00.572
Now do you believe me?

19:00.574 --> 19:01.497
Go talk some sense
into him.

19:01.499 --> 19:02.682
He likes you.

19:02.684 --> 19:06.511
Miss Yoshida,
you want to step outside?

19:06.513 --> 19:08.079
Unless you want tell us
where the contraband <i>saké</i> is.

19:08.081 --> 19:09.839
You're looking
for a scapegoat.

19:09.841 --> 19:11.358
Your man killed himself.

19:11.360 --> 19:12.341
Sir... Major, um...

19:12.343 --> 19:13.768
this is my family's
barracks.

19:13.770 --> 19:15.144
I'm aware.

19:19.183 --> 19:20.367
I tell you what,

19:20.369 --> 19:23.578
point out your bed,
and I'll search it myself.

19:29.527 --> 19:32.003
This for <i>Obon.</i>

19:33.865 --> 19:34.789
What kind of bone?

19:34.791 --> 19:37.533
<i>Obon.</i>

19:37.535 --> 19:39.719
Our custom to honor ancestor.

19:43.058 --> 19:44.540
Sweep it.

19:44.542 --> 19:45.433
All that spook shit.

19:48.304 --> 19:49.879
That's not for <i>Obon.</i>

19:49.881 --> 19:50.605
It's mine.

20:02.577 --> 20:03.868
Made from camp property.

20:08.825 --> 20:11.543
Holy Moses.

20:13.021 --> 20:15.404
You got an entire
still down here?

20:15.406 --> 20:16.998
Just for us.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.258
No one else.

20:18.260 --> 20:20.226
Bullshit.

20:20.228 --> 20:21.836
There's explicit rules laid down

20:21.838 --> 20:23.746
by every block manager.

20:23.748 --> 20:24.714
You wouldn't be
hiding it

20:24.716 --> 20:27.267
if you didn't think
it was wrong.

20:27.269 --> 20:28.676
Let's go.

20:29.679 --> 20:32.646
Hey, hold on,
you got the wrong guy.

20:32.648 --> 20:34.348
All the old man does
is drink the shit.

20:34.350 --> 20:35.257
I made the <i>saké.</i>

20:35.259 --> 20:36.067
Walt...

20:36.928 --> 20:38.503
Walt?

20:38.505 --> 20:40.838
As in Yoshida?

20:40.840 --> 20:42.615
Please tell me
you didn't know about this.

20:42.617 --> 20:43.867
She didn't.

20:43.869 --> 20:45.618
Girls aren't allowed
to touch the stuff anyway.

20:45.620 --> 20:47.512
Look, I don't have
time to adjudicate.

20:47.514 --> 20:49.914
Take Yoshida
to the stockade.

20:52.427 --> 20:55.170
One's just as good
as another.

21:12.588 --> 21:14.647
Chester's father,

21:14.649 --> 21:15.982
Henry-san.

21:17.426 --> 21:20.695
He hates me.

21:21.806 --> 21:24.732
No matter what I do,

21:24.734 --> 21:26.201
he hates me.

21:39.082 --> 21:41.733
Henry-san...

21:41.735 --> 21:42.901
doesn't remember?

21:42.903 --> 21:44.636
You.

21:49.092 --> 21:51.643
I don't remember him...

22:01.437 --> 22:03.921
Two...

22:03.923 --> 22:04.989
Two baby.

22:06.426 --> 22:08.660
Twins?

22:11.781 --> 22:12.664
Twins?

22:14.025 --> 22:15.041
What's wrong?

22:15.043 --> 22:16.934
Nothing at all.

22:16.936 --> 22:18.360
It's wonderful.

22:18.362 --> 22:19.862
Is it too much
of a burden?

22:19.864 --> 22:21.530
We'll need two of everything,

22:21.532 --> 22:22.456
but they can sleep with me.

22:22.458 --> 22:24.199
Don't worry.

22:24.201 --> 22:26.052
We'll manage.

22:27.405 --> 22:28.613
I need to write Chester.

22:28.615 --> 22:30.205
I don't know
what he'll say,

22:30.207 --> 22:30.965
but he's got
no choice in it...

22:30.967 --> 22:31.724
No!

22:34.545 --> 22:36.729
Not until babies born.

22:41.736 --> 22:44.553
What are you doing?

22:44.555 --> 22:46.072
Blessing our home.

22:47.425 --> 22:48.874
Against what?

22:48.876 --> 22:50.201
Aren't twins
supposed to be bad luck?

22:56.326 --> 22:57.883
That's what
my dad used to say.

22:57.885 --> 23:00.569
He said twins bring
death and misfortune.

23:00.571 --> 23:01.296
That's enough.

23:01.298 --> 23:04.223
Be quiet.

23:04.225 --> 23:07.802
There's no curse on my twins.

23:11.040 --> 23:13.891
Do you understand?

23:15.937 --> 23:17.903
You can believe
what you want,

23:17.905 --> 23:19.831
but no one
is to treat my children

23:19.833 --> 23:22.483
like they're goddamned cursed.

23:30.176 --> 23:32.452
<i>"Dear Luz,</i>

23:32.454 --> 23:34.362
<i>another three days,</i>

23:34.364 --> 23:36.438
<i>still no sleep.</i>

23:36.440 --> 23:37.698
<i>I've been stuck at my desk,</i>

23:37.700 --> 23:41.869
<i>searching for a sergeant
from our company.</i>

23:41.871 --> 23:44.297
<i>I think I might be going
a little crazy."</i>

24:03.300 --> 24:04.275
Nakayama...

24:06.804 --> 24:08.655
Not so rough.

24:08.657 --> 24:10.448
Take it easy.

24:12.277 --> 24:13.284
You won't be able
to translate anything

24:13.286 --> 24:14.369
if you manhandle it.

24:21.744 --> 24:25.913
"I left my unit in a ravine

24:25.915 --> 24:32.386
near a cave natives call
"Giant's Door."

24:32.388 --> 24:37.909
They said the devil's camp

24:37.911 --> 24:42.580
was a kilometer due east.

24:42.582 --> 24:44.506
I waited till nightfall

24:44.508 --> 24:46.984
to make my way there.

24:48.846 --> 24:52.323
There were two devils
in the tent.

24:54.427 --> 24:57.186
They were too absorbed
in their work

24:57.188 --> 25:00.281
to notice my arrival..."

25:14.948 --> 25:16.889
"Giant's Door."

25:16.891 --> 25:19.116
Ogawa.

25:19.118 --> 25:21.185
I think I know what took
Sergeant Crittenden...

25:23.122 --> 25:24.605
and I think I know where he is.

26:50.485 --> 26:52.068
Wait.

26:59.235 --> 27:03.329
Enrique is a good name.

27:03.331 --> 27:05.039
I like it.

27:11.697 --> 27:13.731
Sergeant Crittenden,
it's okay,

27:13.733 --> 27:14.656
you're back with us.

27:15.826 --> 27:18.069
We're gonna
take care of you.

27:18.071 --> 27:20.980
Can you tell us anything
about your captors?

27:20.982 --> 27:22.423
Sergeant Crittenden...

27:23.726 --> 27:25.576
Where did they
find him?

27:25.578 --> 27:28.262
Where you said. Giant's Door.

27:33.068 --> 27:34.193
That's how
they found him.

27:34.195 --> 27:35.153
He was in a cave

27:35.155 --> 27:36.754
just talking
gibberish.

27:36.756 --> 27:37.822
He's talking
in Japanese.

27:41.685 --> 27:42.851
"You are a devil."

27:43.872 --> 27:45.121
"A white devil."

27:53.789 --> 27:54.947
Get him out of here.

27:54.949 --> 27:56.031
I don't want that Jap
anywhere near him!

27:56.033 --> 27:57.675
Hey. Hey! Take your
hands off. Come here.

28:03.116 --> 28:03.931
Hold him!

28:20.207 --> 28:22.207
Chester, easy.

28:25.813 --> 28:28.472
What's he
saying?

28:28.474 --> 28:30.474
"I will cut out
your tongue."

28:33.329 --> 28:36.297
"I will gouge out
your eyes."

28:43.932 --> 28:45.506
Chester, he doesn't
know what he's saying!

28:45.508 --> 28:47.658
He's just spitting back
what his captors said to him!

28:56.336 --> 29:00.947
"The weak are meat.

29:00.949 --> 29:04.249
The strong eat."

29:25.881 --> 29:27.848
One step.
One step.

29:27.850 --> 29:30.476
Okay, one step.
Okay.

29:51.240 --> 29:52.790
Lay back...

29:54.894 --> 29:57.394
My midwife! Please!

29:57.396 --> 29:58.729
Please, just...
Please just get...

29:58.731 --> 30:01.065
Yes. I will try.
I will try.

30:01.067 --> 30:01.841
My midwife,

30:01.843 --> 30:02.750
please!

30:02.752 --> 30:04.135
I will try.

30:55.121 --> 30:56.228
Where's my midwife?

30:56.230 --> 30:57.146
I need her.

31:15.083 --> 31:16.248
Push!

31:42.944 --> 31:44.068
It's a boy.

31:54.697 --> 31:56.539
Why isn't he crying?

31:57.892 --> 31:58.849
Keep pushing!

31:58.851 --> 31:59.625
Tell me
what's happening...

32:00.536 --> 32:02.378
Push!

32:04.114 --> 32:05.038
Is he okay?

32:05.040 --> 32:07.282
Is my baby okay?

32:07.284 --> 32:08.676
Is my boy okay?

32:10.787 --> 32:13.264
Tell me what...

32:15.125 --> 32:17.143
What's happened to my baby?

32:30.307 --> 32:31.890
Keep pushing.

32:31.892 --> 32:33.125
- You're almost there.
- I can't...

32:33.127 --> 32:34.827
I want to see my baby.

32:36.647 --> 32:38.389
No, I can't...

32:38.391 --> 32:40.465
Just one more
big push.

32:42.986 --> 32:44.712
One more big push.

33:13.776 --> 33:16.410
What's happening?

33:20.691 --> 33:22.249
Why are my babies
not crying?

33:24.845 --> 33:27.379
What's happening?

33:32.035 --> 33:33.961
Let me see my baby.

33:33.963 --> 33:35.221
Let me...

33:36.373 --> 33:38.641
What happened to my babies?

33:42.304 --> 33:44.730
I'm sorry.

34:13.928 --> 34:16.152
<i>"Things are looking up here.</i>

34:16.155 --> 34:18.822
<i>I'm due to give birth
any day now,</i>

34:18.824 --> 34:20.224
<i>and I won over your dad.</i>

34:21.635 --> 34:23.659
<i>I didn't think
it was possible,</i>

34:23.661 --> 34:24.687
<i>but I did.</i>

34:26.422 --> 34:30.183
<i>I told him we'd name
one of the babies after him.</i>

34:30.185 --> 34:33.754
<i>Yes. Babies!</i>

34:33.755 --> 34:36.356
<i>We're having twins, Chester!</i>

34:36.358 --> 34:37.908
<i>Hikaru and Enrique.</i>

34:37.909 --> 34:41.844
<i>Turns out, your father
likes the name "Enrique."</i>

34:41.847 --> 34:43.956
<i>Who knew?</i>

34:43.958 --> 34:47.868
<i>I can't wait for you
to come home.</i>

34:47.870 --> 34:52.205
<i>Me and the babies
will be waiting for you.</i>

34:52.206 --> 34:56.451
<i>In the meantime,
send some more photos.</i>

34:56.453 --> 34:59.113
<i>Your mom will appreciate it,</i>

34:59.115 --> 35:01.715
<i>and so will I.</i>

35:01.717 --> 35:03.458
<i>Miss you.</i>

35:03.460 --> 35:06.461
<i>A lot.</i>

35:06.463 --> 35:09.565
<i>Love, Luz."</i>

35:39.830 --> 35:41.347
Almost took you for the enemy.

35:41.349 --> 35:43.907
I mean, how's a fella
supposed to tell?

35:51.007 --> 35:54.008
Who let Crittenden out?

35:54.010 --> 35:55.319
He shouldn't be out.

35:58.941 --> 36:00.115
Get him! Get him down!

36:06.782 --> 36:08.115
Sarge, get in here!

36:08.117 --> 36:09.166
This is for you!

36:25.634 --> 36:27.101
Get him.
Get him!

36:35.385 --> 36:36.418
Get the medic!

36:36.420 --> 36:37.461
Yes, sir!

36:37.463 --> 36:38.737
We're gonna need
water over here!

36:38.739 --> 36:40.814
Too late,
they're all dead.

36:40.816 --> 36:42.966
Move, boys!
Hustle!

36:44.578 --> 36:46.394
Sarge!

36:46.396 --> 36:47.912
Sarge!

36:47.914 --> 36:48.747
Someone get
Crittenden a media.

36:48.749 --> 36:50.974
I got you now.

36:50.976 --> 36:52.325
Are you hurt?
Are you hurt?

36:52.327 --> 36:53.493
How is that
possible?

36:53.495 --> 36:55.212
Are you hurt?

36:58.092 --> 36:59.483
No...

36:59.485 --> 37:01.218
I'm fine.

37:37.298 --> 37:38.422
Takahashi?

38:12.057 --> 38:14.249
Someone needs to find Yuko.

38:16.745 --> 38:19.129
We thought you
were sleeping.

38:20.916 --> 38:22.566
Someone needs to find Yuko

38:22.568 --> 38:25.177
and tell her what happened.

38:25.179 --> 38:27.254
Who is Yuko?

38:27.256 --> 38:30.349
My midwife.

38:30.351 --> 38:32.892
I told you.

38:32.894 --> 38:36.021
She lives past
the northeast guard tower.

38:36.023 --> 38:38.431
Nobody lives
in that part of camp.

38:38.433 --> 38:39.991
Yes, they do.

38:39.993 --> 38:42.936
Block 36, barrack 4.

38:42.938 --> 38:45.756
I've been there
many times.

38:45.758 --> 38:49.092
Asako-san, please.

38:49.094 --> 38:50.744
She needs to know.

39:22.719 --> 39:23.610
Yuko-san?

39:28.892 --> 39:29.700
Yuko-san?

41:41.950 --> 41:45.544
Come back tomorrow!

41:45.546 --> 41:47.462
What's wrong with you?
