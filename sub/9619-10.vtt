{\an8}- Good morning, children.

00:09.426 --> 00:12.053
{\an8}Oh, I see you're working
on your big presentation.

00:12.137 --> 00:13.930
{\an8}- Well, Mr. Madigan said
there's only room

00:14.013 --> 00:15.598
{\an8}for one more design
in this month's catalogue.

00:15.682 --> 00:17.517

{\an8}- Well, I'm so sorry
to disappoint you,

he's postponing the meeting.

00:26.526 --> 00:28.236
- Why is Mr. Madigan
moving the meeting?

00:28.319 --> 00:31.698
- He has cleared his entire
schedule because Simon Cristini

00:31.781 --> 00:32.782

00:32.866 --> 00:34.367

I've heard of him.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.177
Still don't care.

00:52.260 --> 00:55.138

that Simon Cristini

00:55.221 --> 00:57.474

most brilliant designers?

00:57.557 --> 00:58.892
- No.

00:58.975 --> 01:00.351
- Or that he and Max
agree to see each other

01:00.435 --> 01:01.269
only one day every year?
- Nope.

01:01.352 --> 01:03.313
- Or that your zipper
has been down

01:03.396 --> 01:04.272

complicated, grown-up stuff.

02:09.586 --> 02:10.797
- Try me.

02:10.880 --> 02:13.424
- They hate each other's guts.

02:13.508 --> 02:14.509
- Really?

02:14.592 --> 02:16.469
I thought they
were best friends.

02:16.553 --> 02:17.345
- Not even close.

02:17.428 --> 02:18.304
They're super competitive.

02:18.388 --> 02:20.390
I mean, when they were partners,
if Max put

02:20.473 --> 02:23.268
one button on a jacket,
Cristini would put on two.

02:23.351 --> 02:25.061
At first, it was
a healthy rivalry.

02:25.144 --> 02:27.188
But in the end,
it produced this...

02:27.564 --> 02:31.192
- [gasps]

02:31.276 --> 02:34.821
- It was called the Jack-butt.

02:34.904 --> 02:36.489
They sold a grand total
of three.

02:36.573 --> 02:39.075
Cristini and Madigan vowed
never to work together again.

02:39.158 --> 02:42.120
- Then why is Mr. Madigan
having him over?

02:42.203 --> 02:44.038
- Oh, they're holding
their yearly competition

02:44.122 --> 02:44.747
for the golden spool.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.666

02:46.749 --> 02:48.918
- [elevator dings]

02:49.002 --> 02:51.796

02:58.344 --> 02:59.387
One moment, Mr. Cristini.

02:59.470 --> 03:00.179
I'll let Mr. Madigan
know you've arrived.

03:00.263 --> 03:03.558
- Oh, that's not
necessary, Oscar.

03:03.641 --> 03:07.854
Maxie, come out, come out
wherever you are--oh.

03:07.937 --> 03:09.314
- Hello, Simon.

03:09.397 --> 03:11.608
How nice to see you again.

03:11.691 --> 03:13.526
- Maximillian.

- Hello, Simon.

03:19.198 --> 03:20.658
- What was your name again?

03:20.742 --> 03:22.869
- You know my name.

03:23.786 --> 03:25.622
- Is it true that
at the end of every day,

03:25.705 --> 03:27.123
he burns the clothes
he was wearing?

03:27.206 --> 03:29.459
- Yes. And then he bakes
the ashes into brownies

03:29.542 --> 03:32.462
and gives them to children
who can't afford clothes.

03:32.545 --> 03:34.297
- So, where is it?
- What?

03:34.380 --> 03:35.882
- The time machine
to transport these suits

03:35.965 --> 03:38.635
back to when they were in style.

03:38.718 --> 03:41.679
[laughing]

03:41.763 --> 03:43.556
- Is it true that he wears
a pair of shoes

03:43.640 --> 03:46.267
over his regular pair of shoes
to make his feet look bigger?

03:46.351 --> 03:47.894
- He wears a child size four.

03:49.979 --> 03:53.942
- So, pray tell, what is
this year's competition? Hmm?

03:54.025 --> 03:56.110
- Ask Max. He gets to decide.

03:56.194 --> 03:57.946
Loser chooser,
those are the rules.

03:58.029 --> 03:58.988
[chuckles]

03:59.072 --> 04:00.406
- I haven't decided yet.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.325
- Can't think of anything
that you're better than me at?

04:02.408 --> 04:05.411
- No, I've just been busy
running a business.

04:10.416 --> 04:12.335
- More like a daycare center
from the looks of it.

04:12.418 --> 04:14.754
- [gasps]
That's really insulting.

04:17.798 --> 04:20.176
- Come back, bouncy.

04:20.259 --> 04:22.679

belongs to you.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.597
Oh, what is that, jelly?

04:27.016 --> 04:28.351

So, did Max discover you
selling cookies in the lobby?

04:45.535 --> 04:46.286
- No.

04:47.245 --> 04:49.706
Sandwiches.

04:49.789 --> 04:50.915
- True's in charge
of our youth apparel.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.209
She's an incredible talent.

04:53.293 --> 04:58.256

That's actually
a very good idea.

05:01.634 --> 05:05.346
So, True Jackson, how do you
like working here at Mad Style?

05:05.430 --> 05:07.390

19:26.164 --> 19:27.082
he could barely

19:27.165 --> 19:30.294
I discovered the only reason
he hired me

19:30.377 --> 19:31.587
was because
I was important to Max.

19:31.670 --> 19:34.089
I wasn't valuable.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.966
I was a pawn.

19:36.049 --> 19:37.342
- What's a pawn?

19:37.426 --> 19:39.469

paying attention

19:39.553 --> 19:41.471
during this game, have you?

19:41.555 --> 19:42.681
- Huh?

19:42.764 --> 19:45.017
- Face it, Max.

19:45.100 --> 19:46.727
You can't beat me.

19:46.810 --> 19:50.188
I'll get your queen eventually,
and then I'll be one step closer

19:50.272 --> 19:54.026
to ruling the world
with my zombie army.

19:54.109 --> 19:54.985
- What?

19:55.068 --> 19:57.321
- Nothing.
I didn't say anything.

20:00.032 --> 20:00.908
I believe it's your move.

20:00.991 --> 20:03.619

20:32.272 --> 20:33.440
- Look, I appreciate
the offer, Mr. Cristini,

20:33.523 --> 20:36.151
but all the skywriting in
the world couldn't make me feel

20:36.234 --> 20:38.320

than I do right here.

Well, excellent battle,
old friend.
