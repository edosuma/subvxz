WEBVTT

00:03.211 --> 00:05.796
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

00:07.257 --> 00:08.716
"Say, Rachel...

00:08.883 --> 00:11.719
...I was wondering if you'd like to go
to a movie with me sometime...

00:11.886 --> 00:13.512
...as my lover."

00:16.056 --> 00:18.142
Mm. Too out there.

00:18.309 --> 00:21.103
"Maybe you'd just like to get
something to eat with me sometime...

00:22.022 --> 00:23.480
...as my lover."

00:26.151 --> 00:27.609
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:27.819 --> 00:29.528
All right, let's go shopping.

00:29.821 --> 00:32.406
You know, before we go, uh,
there's something I need to say.

00:32.824 --> 00:34.908
- Oh. Okay.
- Okay.

00:38.121 --> 00:40.622
I've kind of had this, uh...
This crush on you.

00:41.791 --> 00:44.668
But since you were with Ross,
I didn't do anything about it.

00:44.836 --> 00:48.797
Now that you're not, I'd really
like to ask you out sometime.

00:49.466 --> 00:53.343
So that's what I'm doing now.

00:56.806 --> 00:57.931
Wow. Um...

01:09.069 --> 01:10.360
I dropped a cup.

02:01.079 --> 02:03.914
So that's why within a few years,
that voice recognition...

02:04.082 --> 02:06.250
...is gonna be pretty much standard
on any computer.

02:06.626 --> 02:11.130
You know, so you could be, like,
"Wash my car. Clean my room."

02:11.339 --> 02:13.382
It's not gonna be able to do
any of those things...

02:13.550 --> 02:15.467
...but it'll understand
what you're saying.

02:16.594 --> 02:20.055
- Oh, this was so great.
- Yeah, it was.

02:21.182 --> 02:22.808
All right, then.

02:23.893 --> 02:25.394
Bye.

02:31.025 --> 02:33.694
Hello, people who do not live here.

02:34.571 --> 02:35.946
- Hi.
- Hello.

02:37.907 --> 02:40.325
I gave you a key for emergencies.

02:40.493 --> 02:42.578
We were out of Doritos.

02:44.122 --> 02:46.957
Hey, how'd the date go
with Mr. Millionaire?

02:47.125 --> 02:50.210
"Mr. Millionaire.
New, from Snooty Playthings.

02:51.045 --> 02:53.130
Third wife sold separately."

02:53.882 --> 02:56.842
He's great. I mean,
we have such a good time together.

02:57.010 --> 03:02.097
He's so funny and so sweet.
And I'm not attracted to him at all.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.308
- Still?
- No.

03:04.475 --> 03:08.270
It's driving me crazy. I mean, in every
other way, he's like the perfect guy.

03:08.438 --> 03:12.357
He has everything.
Plus, he actually has everything.

03:12.942 --> 03:16.278
Life-sized lmperial Storm Troopers
from Sharper lmage?

03:16.446 --> 03:17.821
Two.

03:18.364 --> 03:20.574
Wow. Can Joey and I
put them on and fight?

03:22.952 --> 03:31.793
Oh, Mommy. Oh, Daddy.
I am a big old baddy.

03:35.632 --> 03:38.091
I guess he must've gotten the part
in that play.

03:38.259 --> 03:41.220
- Oh.
- Either that or Gloria Estefan was right.

03:41.387 --> 03:43.805
Eventually, the rhythm
is going to get you.

03:49.687 --> 03:52.272
- Joe, how's it going?
- Good.

03:56.694 --> 03:58.612
- Hey.
- Hi.

03:59.322 --> 04:01.073
Ah, so you're playing Adrianne, huh?

04:01.241 --> 04:03.784
Yes. Are you one
of the retarded cousins?

04:05.954 --> 04:09.665
No, no. Uh, I'm playing your husband,
Victor. I'm Joey Tribbiani.

04:09.832 --> 04:12.042
Hi. Nice to meet you. Kate Miller.

04:18.216 --> 04:21.593
Heh. So the, uh, play's pretty great, huh?

04:21.761 --> 04:24.346
Oh, yeah.
I love Jennifer Banberry's work.

04:24.514 --> 04:25.764
She's so brilliantly incisive...

04:25.932 --> 04:28.642
...when it comes to deconstructing
the psyche of the middle class.

04:28.810 --> 04:31.853
Oh, forget about it. She rocks. Ha, ha.

04:36.693 --> 04:38.860
Where do I know you from?

04:40.446 --> 04:42.531
Dr. Drake Ramoray?

04:43.366 --> 04:45.158
Days of our Lives?

04:45.326 --> 04:48.078
Voted most datable neurosurgeon
by Teen Beat?

04:49.372 --> 04:51.290
No, that's not it.

04:52.041 --> 04:53.834
So you're a soap actor.

04:54.043 --> 04:57.296
Well, this must be exciting for you,
being in a real play. Hmm?

04:57.505 --> 05:00.299
Hey, I've done plays before.
I'm a serious actor.

05:01.759 --> 05:02.843
That infomercial.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.014
For the milk-carton-spout thing.

05:07.265 --> 05:09.933
You're the guy who doesn't
know how to pour milk.

05:11.394 --> 05:14.896
See, I actually can pour milk.
But I got you believing that I couldn't.

05:15.064 --> 05:17.566
Ha, ha. Now, see, that's acting.

05:18.192 --> 05:21.069
Right. At the end, you choked
on a cookie.

05:21.404 --> 05:22.946
Yeah, that was real.

05:24.824 --> 05:27.993
- Wow. I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
- I know.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.953
Well, So, what are you gonna tell him?

05:30.121 --> 05:34.166
Well, I told him I would think about it,
but I'm gonna tell him no.

05:34.584 --> 05:35.625
Huh.

05:36.544 --> 05:39.421
I mean, I think I'd say no
to anybody right now.

05:42.383 --> 05:45.677
Oh, but it was so strange.
I mean, I'm standing there...

05:45.845 --> 05:50.098
...with this charming, cute guy
who's asking me to go out with him...

05:50.350 --> 05:52.017
...which I'm allowed to do...

05:52.185 --> 05:56.480
...and I felt guilty, you know,
like I'd be cheating on Ross or something.

05:57.065 --> 06:00.192
Wow. So, okay, maybe that means...

06:00.401 --> 06:04.321
...that you're not over Ross yet
and you have issues with your father.

06:08.326 --> 06:12.120
- I don't have any issues with my father.
- Okay, so it's probably just the Ross thing.

06:14.415 --> 06:16.416
I hate this woman. I hate her.

06:16.626 --> 06:19.211
She told everyone in the company
about that infomercial...

06:19.379 --> 06:22.464
...and now they all keep asking me
to open their drinks.

06:22.632 --> 06:27.010
Okay? And whenever I can't do it,
they're all, like, laughing at me.

06:29.931 --> 06:32.307
- Hello.
- Hey.

06:32.475 --> 06:34.434
So Rachel called.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.145
Wants to see me.

06:38.106 --> 06:40.023
Going over in a minute.

06:40.400 --> 06:45.070
- Wow. What do you think she wants?
- Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted...

06:45.238 --> 06:48.490
...and she realizes that life without me...

06:48.658 --> 06:49.658
...sucks.

06:50.910 --> 06:55.831
It's possible. You are very lovable.
I'd miss you if I broke up with you.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.667
Just trying to be supportive.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.670
Well, be supportive like a guy.

07:02.839 --> 07:05.048
If I broke up with you, I'd miss you.

07:08.845 --> 07:11.513
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:12.348 --> 07:15.725
You, uh, wanted to see me?

07:18.479 --> 07:19.855
Yeah.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.442
Uh, here's a box of your stuff.

07:25.862 --> 07:29.614
- What?
- Uh, it's just like hats and a shirt and CD's.

07:29.782 --> 07:32.033
Just sort of stuff that you've left here.

07:32.201 --> 07:35.287
What are you doing? Are you trying
to hurt me or something?

07:36.205 --> 07:37.747
No.

07:38.791 --> 07:40.292
Ross.

07:41.544 --> 07:45.547
It just seems that, you know,
it's time we, you know, move on.

07:45.715 --> 07:47.215
I mean, don't you think?

07:48.968 --> 07:50.635
- Yes.
- Yeah.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.387
- Yes, I do.
- Good.

07:52.555 --> 07:54.639
Yeah, I really do.

07:56.058 --> 07:57.559
Hey...

07:57.894 --> 08:00.479
This was a gift.

08:00.646 --> 08:03.648
Ross, you got that for free
from the museum gift shop.

08:04.066 --> 08:05.775
It's still a gift.

08:05.943 --> 08:08.487
I got it from the gift shop.

08:10.156 --> 08:12.365
Okay. All right. Give me the mug.
I'll keep the mug.

08:12.533 --> 08:16.620
No. You know, don't do me any favors.
In fact, where...

08:17.330 --> 08:21.166
Where's the rest of my stuff? Huh?
Like my, um...

08:21.334 --> 08:24.669
Hey. This book is mine.

08:26.464 --> 08:31.092
And that T-shirt you sleep in?
I'd like that back too. Yes, I do.

08:32.886 --> 08:37.432
You know how much I love that T-shirt.
You never even wear that T-shirt.

08:37.767 --> 08:40.727
I'm just trying to help you move on.

08:41.229 --> 08:43.980
Oh, you are a petty man.

08:44.148 --> 08:46.274
You are a petty, petty...

08:46.442 --> 08:47.901
- Petty...
...petty, petty...

08:48.069 --> 08:49.361
...small...
...small...

08:53.366 --> 08:55.575
You are so just doing this
out of spite.

08:55.743 --> 08:57.577
Uh-uh. No, no, no.

08:57.745 --> 09:00.872
I'm gonna wear this all the time.
I love this shirt.

09:01.457 --> 09:05.418
You haven't worn that since you were 15.
It doesn't even fit you anymore.

09:05.586 --> 09:07.963
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

09:08.130 --> 09:10.549
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

09:21.894 --> 09:25.313
Now, if you don't mind,
I'm gonna take the rest of my stuff...

09:25.815 --> 09:27.857
...and relax...

09:28.818 --> 09:30.944
...in my favorite shirt.

09:32.863 --> 09:35.031
You have a pleasant evening.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.626
So you're, like, a zillionaire.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.755
And you're our age. You're our age.

09:51.465 --> 09:54.009
You know what?
You should, like, buy a state...

09:54.176 --> 09:56.553
...and then just name it after yourself.

09:57.138 --> 09:58.513
What, like, "Pete Dakota"?

10:00.182 --> 10:01.850
Or "Mississi-Pete."

10:03.436 --> 10:06.688
Ooh, ooh, I got it: "Pete Chicago."

10:08.316 --> 10:10.275
That's not a state, Joe.

10:10.693 --> 10:13.111
Oh, and "Mississi-Pete" is?

10:15.197 --> 10:18.533
I gotta go, so, uh,
I'll see you guys later.

10:18.701 --> 10:21.036
- Okay. You're our age.
- Okay.

10:22.997 --> 10:24.956
So, uh, are we on for tomorrow?

10:25.124 --> 10:26.791
Absolutely.

10:28.336 --> 10:30.670
Now get out of here, you.

10:36.719 --> 10:39.804
Okay, I'm running out of places
I can touch him.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.057
Is there something wrong with me?

10:42.224 --> 10:45.018
I mean, why am I only attracted to guys
where there's no future?

10:45.186 --> 10:47.812
Either they're too old
or they're too young.

10:48.064 --> 10:50.148
And there's Pete,
who's crazy about me...

10:50.399 --> 10:53.735
...and he's absolutely perfect,
and there's, like, zip going on.

10:53.986 --> 10:56.279
Seriously. Does it sound like
something's wrong with me?

10:56.447 --> 10:58.239
Yeah, kind of.

11:00.868 --> 11:03.912
Happy? Is that what
I'm supposed to be, Vic?

11:04.080 --> 11:05.455
Happy?

11:05.623 --> 11:08.208
Well, why don't you tell me
what you're supposed to be? Huh?

11:08.376 --> 11:10.835
Because I sure as hell can't figure it out.

11:11.003 --> 11:13.421
I talk to you, and nothing.

11:13.589 --> 11:16.049
You look at me, and it's nothing.

11:19.178 --> 11:20.428
Nothing.

11:23.057 --> 11:24.182
Tasty.

11:25.810 --> 11:30.021
I'm really starting to feel like
you guys have a history. It's nice.

11:30.189 --> 11:32.524
- I have a question about this scene.
- Yes.

11:32.692 --> 11:37.112
Well, I don't understand
why Adrianne's attracted to Victor.

11:37.279 --> 11:39.781
Peel the onion.

11:40.157 --> 11:42.200
First of all, he's good-looking.

11:42.535 --> 11:43.743
Yeah.

11:43.911 --> 11:46.955
I think my character is gonna need
a bit more of a reason than that.

11:47.123 --> 11:50.375
Oh, hey, how about this one?
Uh, it says so in the script.

11:53.295 --> 11:56.297
You know, I don't know why
my character likes you either.

11:56.465 --> 11:59.467
I mean, it says in the script here
that you're a bitch.

12:00.177 --> 12:02.929
- It doesn't say that in the script.
- It does in mine.

12:06.308 --> 12:09.310
I can blow-dry it, I can put gel on it.
It doesn't matter.

12:09.478 --> 12:12.313
I still wind up with this
little cowlick-y thing...

12:12.481 --> 12:16.067
...on the middle part of my head.
It's so annoying.

12:16.235 --> 12:18.236
- Does it bug you?
- You bug me.

12:31.500 --> 12:34.502
Is there any chance you didn't see that?

12:38.007 --> 12:40.216
Ross, you gotta stop, okay?

12:40.509 --> 12:43.344
You can't just stare through
the peephole for three hours.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.682
You're gonna get peep-eye.

12:48.726 --> 12:51.686
I knew it. I knew it.
I always knew she liked him.

12:52.062 --> 12:54.022
She'd say no, but here we are, right?

12:54.190 --> 12:56.649
We just broke up,
first thing she does.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.401
You didn't just break up.

12:58.569 --> 13:00.528
Hey, it's been, like, three weeks.

13:00.738 --> 13:04.073
You slept with somebody three hours
after you thought you broke up.

13:04.241 --> 13:07.243
I mean, bullets have left guns slower.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.747
Here they come. Here they... Oh.

13:10.915 --> 13:13.666
If she kisses him good night,
I'm gonna kill myself. I swear.

13:13.834 --> 13:15.877
I can't watch.

13:16.712 --> 13:18.671
Come on. Date over. Date over.

13:19.548 --> 13:22.217
- Here we go. She's going in.
- Okay.

13:22.384 --> 13:25.094
She's going in. Ha, ha.
Wait. He's going in.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.556
He's going in.

13:28.724 --> 13:32.560
The door's closed. I can't see
anything with the door closed.

13:32.895 --> 13:36.564
And the inventor of the door
rests happily in his grave.

13:37.066 --> 13:39.442
Okay, I have to do something.
I mean, I have to stop it.

13:39.610 --> 13:41.194
- Stop what?
- I don't know.

13:41.362 --> 13:44.405
But I have a feeling
that my being there will do it.

13:44.615 --> 13:47.158
I'll go over and I will borrow something.

13:47.326 --> 13:49.077
- Juice. I need juice.
- No.

13:49.245 --> 13:50.578
- You can't.
- A little help.

13:51.413 --> 13:53.581
- They must be stopped.
- I am your friend...

13:53.749 --> 13:55.792
...and I am not gonna let you do this.

13:56.126 --> 13:58.503
You are surprisingly strong.

13:59.213 --> 14:02.757
- I need juice. People need juice.
- Look, man...

14:02.925 --> 14:05.844
- People need juice. Juice. They need...
- Listen to me.

14:09.765 --> 14:13.977
She's moving on, okay? If it's not
this guy, it's gonna be somebody else.

14:14.144 --> 14:16.479
And unless you're thinking about
subletting my peephole...

14:16.647 --> 14:20.650
...you are gonna have to get used
to the fact that the relationship is over.

14:20.818 --> 14:24.070
Okay, man? It's over.

14:27.032 --> 14:30.243
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

14:30.411 --> 14:32.954
It's just I miss her so much.

14:34.164 --> 14:35.665
I know.

14:38.127 --> 14:40.378
Why do all your coffee mugs
have numbers on the bottom?

14:40.629 --> 14:43.423
Oh, that's so Monica can keep track.

14:43.591 --> 14:47.385
That way, if one of them is missing,
she can be like, "Where's number 27?"

14:56.353 --> 14:57.520
You know what?

14:57.688 --> 15:00.315
No, and I don't think
I'm gonna want to.

15:00.816 --> 15:01.858
I can't do this.

15:02.026 --> 15:04.569
Yep. Yep.
That's what I didn't want to know.

15:05.029 --> 15:08.406
Yeah. Oh, Mark, I'm just doing this
for the wrong reasons, you know?

15:08.574 --> 15:11.117
I'm just doing it to get back at Ross.

15:11.368 --> 15:14.495
I'm sorry. It's not very fair to you.

15:16.165 --> 15:18.625
Ah. Fair, shmair. You know?

15:18.792 --> 15:21.711
Look, you wanna get back at Ross,
I am here for you.

15:23.339 --> 15:24.422
Really.

15:24.590 --> 15:29.594
No, no. I say we get back at him right here
on this couch. Right here.

15:31.096 --> 15:33.473
Oh, my God.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.392
I'm sorry about this.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.479
That's okay.

15:41.231 --> 15:43.691
- You sure?
- Yeah.

15:45.235 --> 15:48.488
I can just go home
and get back at him by myself.

15:52.493 --> 15:55.119
And should become
the penicillin of the 21 st century.

15:55.287 --> 15:59.290
And so today, this hospital
is about to take major steps...

15:59.458 --> 16:02.168
...toward leading that revolution.

16:02.336 --> 16:05.380
- It is truly ironic.
- Hey. Can I ask you something?

16:09.051 --> 16:10.093
Where are we?

16:11.136 --> 16:14.430
Well, with all these doctors and nurses...

16:14.598 --> 16:16.599
...I'm gonna say, Midget Rodeo.

16:17.726 --> 16:19.060
Just tell me the truth.

16:20.396 --> 16:21.896
Okay.

16:23.315 --> 16:26.484
Um, you know, I don't think
I told you this...

16:26.652 --> 16:30.905
...but, um, I just recently got out
of a really serious relationship.

16:31.156 --> 16:33.408
Oh, right. Wasn't that like a year ago?

16:35.577 --> 16:37.120
So I did tell you.

16:37.913 --> 16:39.956
Okay, well, you know,
that's not really the thing.

16:40.124 --> 16:43.084
The thing is, is that right now
I'm just in a place in my life...

16:43.252 --> 16:45.712
...where I just need to focus on me.
- Mm.

16:45.879 --> 16:47.797
- Do you know what I mean?
- Oh, yeah, I know.

16:50.092 --> 16:54.429
- I so want to be attracted to you.
- But you're not. Okay. Good.

16:54.596 --> 16:56.347
I'm sorry.

16:58.434 --> 17:01.102
You know what? Don't be.
This is not...

17:01.270 --> 17:03.396
Don't be, because it's not so bad.

17:04.272 --> 17:07.775
- It's not?
- Yeah. I know I'm no Jon Bon Jovi.

17:10.279 --> 17:12.613
Or someone you find attractive.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.825
I just think, you know...

17:15.992 --> 17:19.579
...that you might end up
feeling differently.

17:21.540 --> 17:24.916
Well, look, I don't want this
to come out wrong...

17:25.085 --> 17:30.173
...but, uh, you seem awfully confident
for a guy I just told I wasn't attracted to.

17:30.424 --> 17:32.842
Yeah, stupidly charming, isn't it?

17:34.094 --> 17:36.679
Uh, listen. Let's...
You wanna get something to eat?

17:36.847 --> 17:39.182
Because this place is kind of depressing.

17:40.309 --> 17:45.229
Now the man who made
this possible, Mr. Peter Becker.

17:45.856 --> 17:46.939
One second.

17:54.573 --> 17:59.368
I don't think this town is big enough
for the both of us to relax in.

18:02.664 --> 18:04.082
Draw.

18:07.711 --> 18:09.295
I wasn't doing anything.

18:15.803 --> 18:18.262
Uh-oh. What did she do now?

18:18.555 --> 18:23.309
Just because she went to Yale Drama,
she thinks she's, like, the greatest actress...

18:23.477 --> 18:26.187
...since sliced bread.

18:26.772 --> 18:29.899
Ah, Sliced Bread.
A wonderful Lady Macbeth.

18:30.692 --> 18:34.362
God, I just... I hate her. I hate her
with her "Oh, I'm so talented"...

18:34.530 --> 18:38.449
...and "Oh, I'm so pretty,"
and "Oh, I smell so good."

18:39.535 --> 18:41.828
I think somebody has a crush
on somebody.

18:41.995 --> 18:44.872
Hey, Chandler, can we please try
and stay focused on my problem here?

18:45.040 --> 18:46.082
You know?

18:46.542 --> 18:49.669
I'm talking about you, you big, big freak.

18:52.005 --> 18:53.256
Oh.

18:53.841 --> 18:55.842
Oh. You're out of your mind.

18:56.009 --> 18:58.761
Hey, you've done nothing
but talk about her for the last 48 hours.

18:58.929 --> 19:00.221
If you were in school yard...

19:00.389 --> 19:03.683
...you'd be pulling her pigtails
and pushing her down now.

19:03.892 --> 19:06.352
Oh, yeah? Then how come
I keep thinking about her...

19:06.520 --> 19:09.355
...in all these sexual scenarios
and stuff, huh?

19:15.821 --> 19:19.866
Happy? Is that what I'm
supposed to be, Vic? Happy?

19:20.033 --> 19:22.994
Well, why don't you tell me what
you're supposed to be, huh?

19:23.162 --> 19:25.580
Because I sure as hell
can't figure it out.

19:25.747 --> 19:28.207
I talk to you, and it's nothing.

19:28.375 --> 19:31.085
You look at me, and nothing.

19:44.141 --> 19:45.308
Nothing.

19:47.477 --> 19:51.564
You guys make me fly.

19:53.650 --> 19:54.942
High.

19:56.153 --> 19:58.946
Okay, we're gonna pick it up here
tomorrow.

20:01.283 --> 20:03.618
- Well, that was, uh...
- Better?

20:03.952 --> 20:07.163
Yeah, yeah, it was definitely...

20:07.331 --> 20:09.040
...an improvement.

20:10.167 --> 20:11.292
- Good night.
- Uh, Kate.

20:11.460 --> 20:12.793
Yeah?

20:12.961 --> 20:15.671
You, uh... You forgot your shoes.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.801
I'm probably gonna need those, huh?

20:24.681 --> 20:27.350
- Okay.
- Hey, listen...

20:28.227 --> 20:30.478
...you, uh, feel like getting
a cup of coffee?

20:31.980 --> 20:33.064
- Um... Yo.
- Kate.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.149
- You ready to go?
- Yeah.

20:36.818 --> 20:39.904
Very nice. Very nice.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.366
So, um...

20:44.493 --> 20:46.369
- See you tomorrow, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

20:46.536 --> 20:48.037
- Right.
- Good night.

20:58.173 --> 20:59.340
Hey.

21:01.218 --> 21:03.552
Why isn't it "Spiderman"?

21:03.720 --> 21:05.596
You know, like Goldman, Silverman?

21:06.390 --> 21:08.808
Because it's not his last name.

21:09.351 --> 21:12.186
- It isn't?
- No, it's not, like...

21:12.354 --> 21:14.021
Like Phil Spiderman.

21:17.067 --> 21:18.442
He's a spider...

21:18.610 --> 21:20.152
...man.

21:21.196 --> 21:24.407
You know, like, uh...
Like Goldman is a last name.

21:24.574 --> 21:26.909
But there's no gold man.

21:27.452 --> 21:29.370
Oh, okay.

21:29.538 --> 21:31.205
There should be a Gold Man.

21:33.917 --> 21:35.418
- Hey.
- Hey, Rach.

21:35.752 --> 21:37.211
- How was work?
- Oh, great.

21:37.462 --> 21:40.381
Although I did sit down
where there wasn't a chair.

21:41.258 --> 21:43.718
By the way, Ross dropped by
a box of your stuff.

21:43.927 --> 21:47.221
Oh. Well, I guess I had that one coming.

21:47.723 --> 21:51.392
I'm just gonna throw it out.
It's probably just a bunch of shampoo and...

21:52.936 --> 21:54.145
Something wrong?

22:03.030 --> 22:05.239
Hmm. No. Nothing.

22:12.247 --> 22:15.791
So, uh, what kind of powers
would Gold Man have?

22:17.044 --> 22:20.212
Okay. Well, he would turn things to gold.

22:20.797 --> 22:24.925
- What about things that are already gold?
- Ah. His work is done.

22:26.595 --> 22:27.845
Okay, let's play my game.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.096
Okay.

22:29.264 --> 22:32.975
All right, you yellow-bellied,
lily-livered...

22:33.143 --> 22:34.477
Draw.

22:37.689 --> 22:38.773
Yeah, it's fun.
