27:17.600 --> 27:19.600
Maybe a month ago.

27:19.800 --> 27:21.440
She was seeing someone.

27:21.640 --> 27:25.160
And from the way she talked, it was... someone that she loved.

27:25.360 --> 27:27.600
But I never saw him here.

47:57.040 --> 47:59.880
His friends called us traitors.

48:01.040 --> 48:02.800
So we ran.

48:03.600 --> 48:05.640
Took different names.

48:09.920 --> 48:12.720
Other things don't change so easy.

48:19.840 --> 48:24.280
I saw that little girl in Annie every single day.

48:25.680 --> 48:28.880
Her face, her hair...

48:29.080 --> 48:31.040
the way she talked.

48:35.160 --> 48:38.000
Came a time I couldn't look at her.

48:38.840 --> 48:40.680
Couldn't listen.

48:44.720 --> 48:46.240
And now...

48:49.400 --> 48:52.040
Never thought I'd miss pain.

48:54.240 --> 48:58.360
So you hold on to that hurt you got inside you there.

49:00.720 --> 49:03.520
Over that boy and what you did.

49:06.160 --> 49:09.840
It means the bastards haven't turned you into one of them.

49:43.880 --> 49:46.640
(RUSTLING)

50:54.120 --> 50:55.320
(DOOR OPENS)

51:00.880 --> 51:04.440
Custom we have is to ask before we enter people's house.

51:04.640 --> 51:06.960
Wasn't them. Those kids we killed.

51:07.560 --> 51:11.120
It was. I was with one when he died.

51:11.400 --> 51:13.200
Said there was more to it.

51:13.680 --> 51:17.400
Said he saw a Chinaman. A dying man can lie, too.

51:20.680 --> 51:22.400
That was in her things.

51:28.240 --> 51:30.680
"To Annie, with all my love."

51:32.760 --> 51:37.080
Just wanted to let you know, since we're looking out for one another.

51:37.360 --> 51:39.320
So alike and all.

51:46.080 --> 51:47.600
(DOOR CLOSES)

53:01.440 --> 53:03.080
How did it go?

53:12.040 --> 53:15.200
Good! See, all it takes is motivation.

53:15.400 --> 53:19.000
When you put your mind to something, then everything can be...

53:24.560 --> 53:26.360
(NERVOUSLY) I just, uh...

53:27.080 --> 53:29.880
I still need to review the books one more time.
