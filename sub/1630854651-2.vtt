WEBVTT

00:10.083 --> 00:13.291
<i>As that cold bitch winter</i>
<i>bids us adieu,</i>

00:13.375 --> 00:18.416
<i>Chicago emerges from its hibernation</i>
<i>to celebrate the holiest day of the year.</i>

00:18.500 --> 00:20.416
<i>St. Patrick's Day!</i>

00:20.500 --> 00:24.708
<i>Each year we dye our river green</i>
<i>and throw a legendary parade!</i>

00:24.791 --> 00:28.250
<i>And you can always find me</i>
<i>at the O'Malley's Whiskey Float.</i>

00:28.333 --> 00:30.541
<i>It's the highlight of my year!</i>

00:30.625 --> 00:33.041
<i>I've never made it on the float per se.</i>

00:33.125 --> 00:36.166
<i>That honor is reserved</i>
<i>by the O'Malley's Whiskey Queen,</i>

00:36.250 --> 00:39.458
<i>a title currently held</i>
<i>by Chicago's own Molly Lahey.</i>

00:39.541 --> 00:41.833
<i>She spoke only Gaelic until she was nine.</i>

00:41.916 --> 00:46.750
<i>There is no higher honor</i>
<i>than to be the O'Malley's Whiskey Queen.</i>

00:46.833 --> 00:50.041
Anyhoo, tomorrow is St. Patrick's Day,

00:50.125 --> 00:54.458
and I'm gonna be at that float
partying my frickin' Blarney Stones off!

00:54.541 --> 00:56.083
Enough! Stop!

00:56.166 --> 00:57.083
Ms. Dunbrowski,

00:57.166 --> 01:00.500
I simply need an answer,
guilty or not guilty.

01:00.583 --> 01:02.250
Unless getting drunk

01:02.333 --> 01:05.166
and taking a Segway for a joyride
through Millennium Park

01:05.250 --> 01:07.250
and crashing into the Bean is a crime…

01:07.333 --> 01:08.625
It's five crimes.

01:08.708 --> 01:10.916
I'm ordering you
to wear a sobriety bracelet.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.333
You will need to blow into it
whenever prompted.

01:13.416 --> 01:16.250
Failure to do so will lead
to your arrest and jail time.

01:16.333 --> 01:17.958
You will wear it for one month.

01:18.041 --> 01:19.166
A month?

01:19.250 --> 01:22.166
Okay, like I said,
tomorrow's obviously out.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.625
Then we got baseball season, summer--

01:24.708 --> 01:25.541
It starts now.

01:28.166 --> 01:30.833
No!

01:41.625 --> 01:44.625
No!

01:44.708 --> 01:45.666
What's wrong?

01:45.750 --> 01:48.875
I'm still pissed about
not being able to go the parade!

01:48.958 --> 01:50.291
Here, swallow this key.

01:50.375 --> 01:53.458
No. I never passed the last one!

01:53.541 --> 01:56.875
<i> It is time</i>
<i>for your court-ordered sobriety test.</i>

01:56.958 --> 01:58.291
<i>Blow into the tube.</i>

01:58.375 --> 02:00.208
Stupid thing bossing me around!

02:01.666 --> 02:04.583
Well, you can still go down
to the parade and just not drink.

02:04.666 --> 02:09.125
Oh, yeah, and I can just fly down there
using the tiny wings on my back.

02:09.208 --> 02:13.041
Come on, man! It's impossible
to stay sober at that parade!

02:13.125 --> 02:14.958
But if you drink, you go to jail.

02:15.041 --> 02:17.416
I know, so I'm benching myself.

02:17.500 --> 02:19.791
Gonna just eat these boxes of Entenmann's

02:19.875 --> 02:22.666
and have a little me time
with <i>Hill Street Blues.</i>

02:22.750 --> 02:24.458
At least you don't have to work today.

02:24.541 --> 02:26.625
I have to go
pass out samples with Feather.

02:26.708 --> 02:30.916
God, he is such an amazing combination
of boring and annoying.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.166
Yeah. He is kind of like your dad.

02:33.250 --> 02:34.791
I didn't say that.

02:34.875 --> 02:36.875
Hey, before you go,
could you grab me a beer?

02:36.958 --> 02:37.916
You can't drink.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.583
Damn it! Narc!

02:43.291 --> 02:44.291
Oh, hm!

02:44.375 --> 02:47.791
We got to switch back to skim.
This 2% is too sweet.

02:47.875 --> 02:49.833
Dr. Perillo said
I need to up my dairy fats

02:49.916 --> 02:52.125
until my ovulation gets back on sync.

02:52.208 --> 02:54.291
Speaking of which,
today's the day.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.291
Positive sign, come on down!

02:56.375 --> 02:57.958
You're the next contestant on--

02:58.041 --> 02:58.958
-Stop. Stop it.
-Sorry.

03:03.041 --> 03:05.333
Shoot. I must have been
ovulating on Thursday,

03:05.416 --> 03:07.750
when I was at Rachel's
Scents & Snacks party.

03:07.833 --> 03:09.125
I felt my body temp rise,

03:09.208 --> 03:13.041
but Rachel said it was just
the Cinnamon Storm candle. Idiot.

03:13.125 --> 03:14.750
I'm so sorry, Bonbon.

03:14.833 --> 03:19.083
So, does this mean I'm going to go meet up
with my online golf buddies at the parade?

03:19.166 --> 03:21.916
Duh. I won't need you
for another month now.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.916
Oh, I didn't mean it like that.
I'm just annoyed.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.708
Oh, yeah? Well, does this hat
make you less annoyed?

03:27.791 --> 03:29.500
Nope, quite the opposite.

03:29.583 --> 03:30.416
Okay.

03:30.500 --> 03:33.333
Well, if you need me,
I'll be with the "Double Bogies."

03:39.083 --> 03:43.000
I think you're gonna have
to frisk me, Lieutenant Buntz.

03:43.083 --> 03:45.375
I've been a bad--

03:45.458 --> 03:47.875
<i>We've got a spooky one tonight.</i>

03:47.958 --> 03:49.166
What? No!

03:49.250 --> 03:52.500
Someone taped Svengoolie
over my spank tape.

03:54.041 --> 03:54.958
Eh.

03:58.958 --> 04:01.541
-What?
<i>-Diane! It's Hank Buckley.</i>

04:01.625 --> 04:03.041
Handsome Hank?

04:03.125 --> 04:05.875
Diane, I'm having
a bit of an emergency here.

04:05.958 --> 04:11.041
We just found out Molly Lahey is having
a gout flare-up and can't even stand.

04:11.125 --> 04:14.500
I was actually hoping that,
uh, you could take her place?

04:14.583 --> 04:16.375
<i>No one would be better</i>

04:16.458 --> 04:19.708
at keeping the party alive
and slamming back those shots, right?

04:19.791 --> 04:22.541
Me? The O'Malley's Whiskey Float Queen?

04:22.625 --> 04:24.958
-<i>Blow into the tube.</i>
-<i>What was that?</i>

04:25.041 --> 04:26.166
My court brace--

04:26.250 --> 04:27.666
I mean, my neighbor!

04:27.750 --> 04:29.458
Courtney… Bracelet!

04:29.541 --> 04:32.625
<i>So, what do you say, Diane?</i>
<i>It's what you always wanted.</i>

04:35.041 --> 04:37.041
<i>Repeat.</i>
<i>Blow into the tube.</i>

04:37.125 --> 04:38.708
You can count on me, Hank!

04:38.791 --> 04:41.833
See ya in a few,
ya friggin' hunk of corned beef.

04:41.916 --> 04:44.750
Activated charcoal recovery bar!

04:44.833 --> 04:46.625
They're nutritious and delicious!

04:46.708 --> 04:48.166
Hey, Feather. How's it going?

04:48.250 --> 04:49.708
-Great! Gah!
-These suck!

04:49.791 --> 04:51.541
That hasn't happened too much.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.333
I will say, though,
this crowd isn't for me.

04:54.416 --> 04:57.166
A lot of cultural misappropriation
going on…

04:57.250 --> 04:58.708
Free whiskey!

05:00.458 --> 05:02.625
Um, I think everyone's just having fun.

05:02.708 --> 05:04.791
You know what's fun, Daniel?
Good nutrition!

05:05.791 --> 05:08.375
Whoa! This dude pissed himself.

05:09.500 --> 05:10.833
Joke's on you, sir.

05:10.916 --> 05:14.250
My hemp underwear
will be dry in a matter of hours.

05:14.916 --> 05:19.166
Tin, you're my only sober friend.
I'm desperate and I need you right now.

05:19.250 --> 05:21.708
Girl, I've been waiting for this day.

05:21.791 --> 05:24.875
I've watched you hover
around rock bottom for <i>years</i>.

05:24.958 --> 05:28.500
I've talked about you in <i>meetings</i>.
I am here for you.

05:29.083 --> 05:31.875
Great! I need you to blow
into this breathalyzer

05:31.958 --> 05:34.375
so I can get lit and be
the O'Malley's Whiskey Queen.

05:34.458 --> 05:36.791
God, grant me the serenity

05:36.875 --> 05:40.416
not to smack my friend
upside the head right now.

05:40.500 --> 05:42.666
Tina! I am not being overly dramatic

05:42.750 --> 05:46.166
when I say this will literally
complete me as a person.

05:46.250 --> 05:49.041
Diane, that's the saddest thing
I've ever heard.

05:49.125 --> 05:50.916
And I used to date a magician.

05:54.125 --> 05:56.125
Gideon…

05:56.208 --> 05:57.583
Uh-huh. No, no, no.

05:57.666 --> 06:00.291
I don't want any part
of your childish games.

06:00.375 --> 06:01.916
Childish!

06:02.000 --> 06:02.916
That's it!

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
I can ask my child, Mikey!

06:05.083 --> 06:06.333
Thanks, Gideon!

06:06.416 --> 06:07.416
Don't thank me.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.416
-It assumes complicity.

06:22.208 --> 06:23.833
Mark!

06:23.916 --> 06:26.833
-This is so much fun!

06:26.916 --> 06:28.541
Activated charcoal bar?

06:28.625 --> 06:30.500
You can barely taste the charcoal.

06:30.583 --> 06:33.291
Terry? Holy shit, it <i>is</i> you!

06:33.375 --> 06:35.541
Oh, no. His name's Feather.

06:35.625 --> 06:37.041
Feather?

06:37.125 --> 06:39.583
No, this is Terry Dookindarf.

06:39.666 --> 06:42.500
This guy was a beast.
The Lion of LaSalle Street.

06:42.583 --> 06:45.250
I'm not the Lion anymore.

06:45.333 --> 06:47.833
Terry could out-party anyone
at the Board of Trade.

06:47.916 --> 06:52.125
I've seen him take down three eight balls
by himself in one night.

06:52.208 --> 06:54.750
-I don't play pool. Is that good?
-What's with the hair?

06:54.833 --> 06:56.833
-No, please!

06:56.916 --> 06:58.208
You wear a wig?

06:58.291 --> 07:00.250
Oh, wow! Sorry, man!

07:00.333 --> 07:02.583
We're heading to McDougal's,
you should come with.

07:02.666 --> 07:04.916
No, I-I can't. We're working.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.625
This charcoal tastes like ass!

07:06.708 --> 07:09.916
Oh, okay… we'll see you later, Terry.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.250
Uh, you mean "Feather."

07:12.333 --> 07:13.416
I know, right?

07:13.500 --> 07:15.875
Goddammit! I'm a fraud, Daniel!

07:15.958 --> 07:17.833
Hey, man, forget those guys.

07:17.916 --> 07:19.000
We all have a past.

07:19.083 --> 07:21.041
I used to tell people I was straight.

07:21.125 --> 07:23.416
Well, I used to know how to have fun.

07:23.500 --> 07:24.708
Now look at me.

07:24.791 --> 07:27.583
Passing out blocks of charcoal
at a liquor parade.

07:27.666 --> 07:31.666
Feather, you can still have fun
and be true to the person you are now.

07:32.250 --> 07:33.750
You know what? You're right!

07:33.833 --> 07:37.041
Freak these crummy bars.
They do taste like ass.

07:37.125 --> 07:38.458
Let's take a shot.

07:38.541 --> 07:40.125
Oh. Okay. Cool.

07:40.916 --> 07:42.125
Ow!

07:42.208 --> 07:44.208
Terry loves his whiskey.

07:44.291 --> 07:46.375
You want to grab a beer? My treat.

07:46.458 --> 07:48.583
Okay, where should we go?

07:49.541 --> 07:50.916
I know a place.

07:53.416 --> 07:55.333
Holy shamrock.

07:55.416 --> 07:58.625
Now I know how the Egyptians felt
when they discovered the pyramids.

07:58.708 --> 08:00.291
Hi, you must be Diane.

08:00.375 --> 08:02.208
So, the float's about to start rolling.

08:02.291 --> 08:05.625
We got a porta-potty on board,
but no number twos.

08:05.708 --> 08:08.541
Here's the ceremonial glass
you'll do the first shot out of.

08:08.625 --> 08:09.458
Great!

08:09.541 --> 08:11.208
Just waiting on my plus-size one.

08:11.291 --> 08:12.583
I mean, my plus-one.

08:12.666 --> 08:15.000
Ma? Ma!

08:15.083 --> 08:18.250
Mikey, thank God! My sober blower.

08:18.333 --> 08:20.083
I got you, Ma.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.875
Oh, that reeks!

08:22.958 --> 08:24.666
Have you been drinking today?

08:24.750 --> 08:26.291
No! Oh, wait!

08:26.375 --> 08:28.458
I'm probably still drunk from last night!

08:28.541 --> 08:32.416
All right, now who's ready
to get this O'Malley's Float started?

08:32.500 --> 08:34.666
-<i>Blow into the tube.</i>

08:35.791 --> 08:38.708
There she is! This year's Queen.

08:38.791 --> 08:42.208
I can't wait to see
what's under that dress later on.

08:42.291 --> 08:44.750
Ew! Back off, rat man!

08:44.833 --> 08:48.166
Diane, i-it's me. Hank Buckley.

08:53.916 --> 08:54.916
Hunky Hank?

08:55.000 --> 08:56.166
Oh my God!

08:56.250 --> 08:58.791
What happened to your face and body?

08:58.875 --> 09:00.083
Was there an accident?

09:00.166 --> 09:02.000
No accident.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.916
I did finally get
that pesky back brace off.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.916
-Thanks for noticing.
-Yeah…

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
We got ten city blocks of partying
ahead of us and then you're coronated.

09:12.083 --> 09:15.166
If all goes well,
maybe I'll tell Molly Lahey

09:15.250 --> 09:18.291
we have a new permanent Queen in town.

09:19.416 --> 09:22.750
Holy crap, I can't believe
that's Hunky Hank.

09:22.833 --> 09:26.208
I must've had major beer blinders on
during our make-out seshes.

09:26.291 --> 09:28.041
I don't wanna hear about that, Ma.

09:28.125 --> 09:32.458
Ladies and gentlemen,
raise your glasses and let's get started.

09:34.208 --> 09:35.250
Mikey, quick.

09:35.333 --> 09:37.958
Go make a big distraction.
Get their eyes off me.

09:38.041 --> 09:39.791
-Ten-four, Ma.

09:40.708 --> 09:42.750
Please forgive me, Lord.

09:43.916 --> 09:47.375
LeBron James is the greatest
basketball player of all time!

09:51.208 --> 09:53.666
-It's MJ!

09:53.750 --> 09:55.708
Jordan's the best!

09:55.791 --> 09:57.000
Please, go, go, go!

09:57.083 --> 09:58.708
Get him!

09:59.416 --> 10:02.291
Hey! Let's frickin' party!

10:05.791 --> 10:07.291
It's so funny, Feather.

10:07.375 --> 10:09.291
I can't imagine you hanging out here.

10:09.375 --> 10:12.125
Are you kidding me?
I used to own this place.

10:12.208 --> 10:13.125
Cindy!

10:13.208 --> 10:14.833
-It's Rachel.
-Rachel!

10:14.916 --> 10:18.333
Four shots of Jameson, two Jägers,
and four Irish car bombs.

10:18.416 --> 10:20.458
That's… a lot.

10:20.541 --> 10:22.750
Correction. That's a start.

10:27.375 --> 10:28.541
Woo-hoo!

10:28.625 --> 10:30.541
Terry's having fun now!

10:30.625 --> 10:32.958
Hey! Skinny Joe still hang around here?

10:33.041 --> 10:34.833
Yeah, you know where to find him.

10:34.916 --> 10:36.000
I'll be honest.

10:36.083 --> 10:38.291
I was kind of bummed
to have to work today,

10:38.375 --> 10:40.333
but this is awesome!

10:40.416 --> 10:43.500
Yeah… Uh, what?
Uh, I'm gonna go do a bump.

10:43.583 --> 10:44.791
I mean, I gotta pee.

10:44.875 --> 10:46.833
Okay, more for me.

10:51.166 --> 10:53.833
I don't know why
you aren't picking up, Mark,

10:53.916 --> 10:55.875
but the test was positive.

10:55.958 --> 11:00.708
We have a very short window to have S-E-X.

11:00.791 --> 11:02.375
I'm coming to you.

11:02.458 --> 11:04.166
-I'm the same way.

11:04.250 --> 11:07.250
When I need it, I need it, you know?

11:08.333 --> 11:10.583
Can you turn on the radio, please?

11:10.666 --> 11:12.958
-All right!
-Happy St. Patrick's Day!

11:13.041 --> 11:14.541
-Keep them coming!
-Shot!

11:14.625 --> 11:17.500
-Do a shot with us, Queen!
-Stop fucking enabling me!

11:17.583 --> 11:19.833
I mean, not quite yet, sweetie.

11:19.916 --> 11:21.750
Gotta pace myself, ya know?

11:21.833 --> 11:23.750
Everything okay, Diane?

11:23.833 --> 11:25.208
I'm a little light-headed

11:25.291 --> 11:27.750
from all the drinks
I've definitely been drinking.

11:27.833 --> 11:30.125
Here. Let's get some food in you.

11:30.208 --> 11:33.416
Oh my God! I fricking love Irish nachos.

11:33.916 --> 11:34.750
Ugh!

11:34.833 --> 11:37.458
The corned beef has gone bad!

11:37.541 --> 11:39.416
Do not eat the nachos!

11:39.500 --> 11:41.833
-I was eating those!
-My church pants!

11:42.750 --> 11:45.333
These are delicious.
What's wrong with you?

11:45.416 --> 11:46.458
I-I don't know.

11:46.541 --> 11:49.583
For some reason,
they just taste very different.

11:49.666 --> 11:50.625
Uh…

11:50.708 --> 11:53.125
Hey, let's pump up the tunes!

11:53.708 --> 11:55.458
-Yeah!

11:55.541 --> 11:57.125
-Yeah!

11:57.208 --> 11:58.375
Let's rock!

11:58.458 --> 12:00.291
Come on, everybody!

12:03.250 --> 12:04.875
Find that groove!

12:04.958 --> 12:06.000
You first!

12:07.000 --> 12:07.833
You suck!

12:09.541 --> 12:12.458
Yeah, I'm gonna run
to the little lasses' room real quick.

12:12.541 --> 12:14.500
-<i>Blow into the tube.</i>

12:21.250 --> 12:24.291
Diane, I already told you.
I ain't covering your drunk ass.

12:24.375 --> 12:25.708
I'm not drunk!

12:25.791 --> 12:27.458
<i>-I'm sober!</i>
Keep talking.

12:27.541 --> 12:30.083
Food tastes weird, Hank's a mole man.

12:30.166 --> 12:32.708
My dancing is stiffer than Zuzana's perm.

12:35.416 --> 12:37.708
And cigarettes are gross!

12:37.791 --> 12:40.041
Your body is adjusting
to life without alcohol

12:40.125 --> 12:41.541
and your senses are sharpening.

12:41.625 --> 12:42.875
It's 11:00 a.m., by the way,

12:42.958 --> 12:45.375
so not drinking shouldn't
be that big of a deal.

12:45.458 --> 12:47.708
Just tell me
how to get through this sober.

12:47.791 --> 12:49.875
Okay. Tell me where you are right now.

12:49.958 --> 12:52.375
I'm in a porta-potty on a float
holding in a deuce,

12:52.458 --> 12:53.625
sucking on a CBD gummy.

12:53.708 --> 12:56.166
Normally we'd call that
"hitting rock bottom."

12:56.250 --> 12:58.333
But with you, I'm not so sure.

12:59.541 --> 13:04.125
And the ironical thing is
it was the best sex I ever had.

13:04.208 --> 13:07.750
So now, I actually prefer a micropenis.

13:07.833 --> 13:09.583
-Stop the cab!

13:09.666 --> 13:12.250
Your stories are too personal.

13:13.583 --> 13:16.000
Mark! Thank God. I'm ovulati--

13:16.083 --> 13:18.916
Huh? Hey, pretty lady.

13:19.500 --> 13:20.666
Damn it.

13:20.750 --> 13:22.416
-Uh?

13:22.500 --> 13:23.791
Ugh! Damn it!

13:25.250 --> 13:26.458
-He's rhyming!

13:26.541 --> 13:30.000
When I was a wee lad of eight,
my ma gave me a drink which was great.

13:30.083 --> 13:31.750
I asked, "What is in this?"

13:31.833 --> 13:33.333
She said, "It is Guinness."

13:33.416 --> 13:36.166
And that sip is what sealed my fate.

13:40.750 --> 13:44.333
Oh! I love this guy. I'm hammered.

13:44.416 --> 13:47.791
If we run out of liquor,
we know whose stomach to pump for more.

13:47.875 --> 13:52.375
Yeah! Let's get another rhyme going
for my little leprechaun here.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.583
The feck did you just call me?

13:55.666 --> 13:56.916
Oh, no.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.708
I know you're not <i>literally</i> a leprechaun,

13:59.791 --> 14:01.625
but you gotta admit.

14:01.708 --> 14:04.708
The outfit, the little jig dancing.

14:04.791 --> 14:05.833
The limericks.

14:05.916 --> 14:08.833
I want to, like, hire you for parties.

14:08.916 --> 14:11.750
Who are you? I'm literally obsessed.

14:11.833 --> 14:13.500
Name's Jim McDougal.

14:13.583 --> 14:17.166
And you're in my feckin' bar
and nobody, and I mean nobody,

14:17.250 --> 14:18.833
calls me a fecking leprechaun.

14:18.916 --> 14:19.750
Oh, boy.

14:21.666 --> 14:23.250
Tina. What do I do?

14:23.333 --> 14:24.583
Just get out of there.

14:24.666 --> 14:26.750
-Diane, it's crowning time.

14:26.833 --> 14:29.541
No, I'm just going number one. I swear!

14:29.625 --> 14:31.791
I mean out here. Come on!

14:31.875 --> 14:35.875
"Absotutely". Just gotta… uh, wipe good.

14:35.958 --> 14:39.416
Tina, if I don't go out there
and do a shot in front of these people,

14:39.500 --> 14:41.041
then I'm not the queen.

14:41.125 --> 14:42.750
Real queens own their shit.

14:42.833 --> 14:44.500
And as long as you're authentic,

14:44.583 --> 14:46.541
people won't care
if you're drinking or not.

14:46.625 --> 14:48.458
It's the bravest thing you can do

14:48.541 --> 14:49.500
and you have never

14:49.583 --> 14:50.958
<i>not been your authentic self.</i>

14:51.041 --> 14:56.375
<i>So</i>,<i> go out there and show everyone</i>
<i>what my sober boss bitch can throw down.</i>

14:56.458 --> 14:58.666
Tina, you're my fricking homegirl.

14:58.750 --> 15:00.916
<i>Don't say "homegirl." Just say girl.</i>

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Copy that.

15:04.250 --> 15:06.041
And this isn't a feckin' costume.

15:06.125 --> 15:10.833
These clothes were handed down to me
from my da and his da before him.

15:11.750 --> 15:15.666
Daniel. I-I need 20 bucks
and a key with a good groove in it.

15:15.750 --> 15:18.250
Terry feckin' Dookindarf!

15:18.333 --> 15:19.375
Now, you got some nerve

15:19.458 --> 15:21.791
showing your face around here
after all these years.

15:21.875 --> 15:24.208
You've got eight grand on your bar tab,

15:24.291 --> 15:26.541
and today, you are fecking paying it.

15:26.625 --> 15:29.458
-We should probably go.
-Daniel, stay calm. I got this.

15:29.541 --> 15:31.708
Fuck you, you short little shit!

15:31.791 --> 15:32.916
You got receipts?

15:33.000 --> 15:36.666
-If not, you can suck my big fucking dick!

15:36.750 --> 15:38.541
Maybe we settle this the old way.

15:38.625 --> 15:42.583
Oh, I've been waiting to beat your ass
for years, you tiny bitch.

15:42.666 --> 15:44.250
Not tiny, normal size.

15:44.333 --> 15:46.666
I'm not fighting you, me son is.

15:46.750 --> 15:50.458
Seamus? He's 13.
I'll kick his fucking ass.

15:50.541 --> 15:51.833
Seamus!

15:56.625 --> 15:57.791
Ooh!

16:04.208 --> 16:05.208
Yeah!

16:17.541 --> 16:20.666
Oh, shit! He's, like, 21 now.

16:20.750 --> 16:23.375
I forgot about the passage of time.

16:25.625 --> 16:28.125
So, without further ado,

16:28.208 --> 16:33.666
let us raise a glass and crown this year's
O'Malley's Whiskey Queen.

16:33.750 --> 16:35.833
Big smile, big sip.

16:35.916 --> 16:37.875
Then the crown is yours.

16:37.958 --> 16:38.958
Ugh.

16:40.000 --> 16:40.916
Whoo!

16:41.000 --> 16:42.791
How's everybody doing?

16:42.875 --> 16:45.833
Yeah! Everyone raise their glass

16:45.916 --> 16:48.916
-and share a toast to O'Malley's,

16:49.000 --> 16:51.833
which I will not be drinking today.

16:51.916 --> 16:53.333
-Say what?
-Are you serious?

16:53.416 --> 16:55.750
Don't get me wrong,
I want you all to drink,

16:55.833 --> 16:58.166
but I'm actually sober.

16:58.250 --> 17:00.041
It's not normally who I am.

17:00.125 --> 17:02.416
But today, it actually <i>is</i> who I am.

17:02.500 --> 17:06.208
And I'm okay with that because I am enough

17:06.291 --> 17:09.916
and I don't need alcohol
to be the Whiskey Queen.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.125
Am I right?

17:14.083 --> 17:16.750
You're not right at all.
You suck, lady.

17:18.125 --> 17:20.083
-Hey! Whoa! Jeez!

17:20.166 --> 17:23.208
Her not drinking
makes me feel bad about myself!

17:30.625 --> 17:31.875
Oh, no!

17:33.208 --> 17:36.583
For the love--
They said no number twos in here!

17:38.291 --> 17:40.000
-<i>Tina!</i>
-Hey, how'd it go?

17:40.958 --> 17:42.583
-Well, I was honest.
<i>-Good.</i>

17:42.666 --> 17:44.708
And they threw me off the float.

17:44.791 --> 17:48.375
But you did it.
You should feel good about that.

17:48.458 --> 17:49.750
Well, I don't.

17:49.833 --> 17:52.375
Stop throwing things at me,
you drunk fools!

17:52.458 --> 17:55.125
Turns out, me being sober
is no use to anyone.

17:55.208 --> 17:58.041
At this point,
I might as well just go get drunk.

17:58.125 --> 18:00.416
-Hey, watch it!

18:00.500 --> 18:02.000
<i>Diane, remember,</i>

18:02.541 --> 18:04.416
if you drink, you'll go to jail.

18:05.958 --> 18:06.833
Aah!

18:06.916 --> 18:09.541
Di-- Diane? Hello? Diane?

18:10.208 --> 18:11.375
-Goddammit.

18:13.250 --> 18:15.416
What is wrong with you people?!

18:15.500 --> 18:16.541
Ugh!

18:18.208 --> 18:20.625
Get… outta my way!

18:22.791 --> 18:24.208
Goddamn!

18:24.291 --> 18:25.541
-Ugh!

18:25.625 --> 18:27.166
Watch it! Ah!

18:27.250 --> 18:28.291
Bonnie?!

18:29.125 --> 18:30.666
Over here!

18:30.750 --> 18:34.291
Need to find Mark.
We gotta… fuck.

18:34.375 --> 18:35.458
My God!

18:35.541 --> 18:39.125
Literally every person in the city
is drunk except me!

18:39.208 --> 18:40.916
-This is a nightmare!

18:44.041 --> 18:46.541
Sorry. Happy Irish.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.041
Aah!

18:49.791 --> 18:51.583
Free whiskey!

18:51.666 --> 18:53.583
-<i>Blow into the tube.</i>

18:53.666 --> 18:55.541
Free whiskey!

18:55.625 --> 18:57.541
Fuck off, Mr. Roboto.

18:59.250 --> 19:00.916
Are you sure about this, Feather?

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
That guy looks… terrifying.

19:03.083 --> 19:05.458
What? Him? Those are glamour muscles.

19:06.500 --> 19:08.125
And that's glamour steel.

19:08.208 --> 19:10.416
Okay, I'm gonna hit the head again.

19:10.500 --> 19:13.916
You hold these, and don't let
that Irish pussy go anywhere.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.875
It's go time. Where is he?

19:15.958 --> 19:17.541
Bathroom. Should be back in a few--

19:17.625 --> 19:19.000
-Hm.

19:19.083 --> 19:20.625
Oh, no.

19:20.708 --> 19:23.208
Feckin' coward. Looks like you're up, lad.

19:23.291 --> 19:24.291
Wait. What?

19:24.375 --> 19:25.833
-New fighter!

19:25.916 --> 19:29.000
New fighter!
New fighter! New fighter!

19:33.125 --> 19:37.166
Okay, if you don't want me to drink,
show me a sign.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
New fighter!
New fighter! New fighter!

19:43.583 --> 19:45.666
-What the--? Ugh!

19:50.500 --> 19:51.958
Place your bets!

19:52.041 --> 19:54.500
The lad's going off of ten grand to one.

19:54.583 --> 19:57.375
Please. I can't do this.
I've never been in a fight,

19:57.458 --> 19:59.583
unless you count stage combat class.

19:59.666 --> 20:00.625
And I got a C!

20:00.708 --> 20:03.458
You shoulda thought about that
before you ran your mouth

20:03.541 --> 20:04.750
and called me the L word.

20:04.833 --> 20:06.666
I didn't call you a lesbian!

20:06.750 --> 20:07.666
Leprechaun!

20:07.750 --> 20:10.583
Oh. See, L word usually implies lesbian.

20:10.666 --> 20:11.916
There was a whole show…

20:13.000 --> 20:14.125
Doesn't matter. Please stop.

20:15.333 --> 20:16.750
You're dead, boy-o.

20:16.833 --> 20:18.041
Stop the fight!

20:18.125 --> 20:19.375
-Move it, move it!

20:19.958 --> 20:22.916
Aunt Diane? Help me! I'm drunk.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.291
Who the feck are you?

20:24.375 --> 20:27.041
I'm his aunt,
and I'm shuttin' this shit down.

20:27.125 --> 20:28.833
Take those gloves off, kiddo.

20:28.916 --> 20:31.625
-I can't, they taped me into them!
-The gloves stay on.

20:31.708 --> 20:32.583
Bets are laid.

20:32.666 --> 20:34.541
The boy will fight until the debt is paid.

20:35.791 --> 20:37.875
-Stop, it wasn't a purposeful rhyme.

20:37.958 --> 20:40.666
-I don't speak in limerick all the time.

20:40.750 --> 20:42.250
-Okay, I heard that one.

20:42.333 --> 20:43.791
The rhyming is now done.

20:43.875 --> 20:45.916
-Not done, over. It's over.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.375
-God, every fecking--

20:47.458 --> 20:49.125
Wait!

20:49.208 --> 20:51.750
What is that? It reeks like gas in here.

20:51.833 --> 20:53.750
-She's trying to stop the fight.

20:53.833 --> 20:55.916
-She's lying.
-The hell I am!

20:56.000 --> 20:58.666
You can't smell it 'cause you're drunk!

20:58.750 --> 21:01.833
It's St. Patrick's Day. Everyone is drunk!

21:01.916 --> 21:03.250
I'm not!

21:03.333 --> 21:05.958
And I'm telling you,
we need to get out of here.

21:06.041 --> 21:08.875
-She's right, the needle's in the red!

21:08.958 --> 21:10.375
Everybody run!

21:10.458 --> 21:13.625
Come on, everybody out, quick!
The place is gonna blow up!

21:18.083 --> 21:19.583
How are you holding up, bud?

21:19.666 --> 21:23.625
Ugh. I'm hungry,
but I also have to throw up.

21:23.708 --> 21:26.750
-Yeah, isn't that the best?

21:26.833 --> 21:27.833
Tina!

21:27.916 --> 21:30.416
Oh, no! I'm too late!

21:30.500 --> 21:33.541
No. This isn't my puke. I didn't drink.

21:33.625 --> 21:34.958
Everything worked out.

21:36.375 --> 21:37.666
Holy shit!

21:37.750 --> 21:40.458
Oh! There's a second floor!

21:40.541 --> 21:46.291
Tina, believe it or not,
I <i>saved</i> these people <i>because</i> I was sober.

21:46.375 --> 21:48.083
I'm really proud of you, Diane.

21:48.166 --> 21:50.375
I couldn't have done it without you, Tin.

21:50.458 --> 21:52.125
And when this bracelet comes off,

21:52.208 --> 21:55.000
-I'm gonna toast one in your honor.
-I'm sorry, what?

21:55.083 --> 21:58.041
Obviously, I'm gonna
go back on the sizzauce,

21:58.125 --> 22:00.833
but now I know I can quit when I want to.

22:00.916 --> 22:01.958
Thanks to you.

22:02.041 --> 22:03.875
Now how about a ride home?

22:03.958 --> 22:05.791
This is your own fault, Tina.

22:05.875 --> 22:07.458
You did this to yourself.

22:07.541 --> 22:08.583
Come on, get in.

22:11.250 --> 22:13.583
Yes, Mark! Yes, Mark!

22:13.666 --> 22:16.083
Yes, Mark! Yes, Mark!

22:16.166 --> 22:19.916
<i>I can't believe</i>
<i>my craziest St. Patrick's Day of all time</i>

22:20.000 --> 22:22.291
<i>was the one I didn't drink at.</i>

22:23.166 --> 22:25.875
<i>Later on,</i>
<i>Daniel and Feather figured it out.</i>

22:25.958 --> 22:30.208
<i>Feather realized he was better off</i>
<i>leaving his past in the past</i>

22:30.291 --> 22:32.916
<i>and he gave Daniel</i>
<i>two extra days off a month</i>

22:33.000 --> 22:34.750
<i>in exchange for his silence.</i>

22:36.000 --> 22:39.291
<i>As for me,</i>
<i>thanks to a little help from Tina,</i>

22:39.375 --> 22:43.041
<i>I learned that I am capable</i>
<i>of having control.</i>

22:43.125 --> 22:46.750
I might have blown my only chance
at being the Whiskey Queen,

22:46.833 --> 22:49.208
but not all queens wear crowns.

22:49.708 --> 22:52.250
Some of them wear bracelets.

22:53.250 --> 22:54.916
Stop! Please stop.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.708
I don't know any of those people
and I don't care.

22:57.791 --> 23:00.625
I called you back today
to remove your bracelet.

23:00.708 --> 23:03.166
What? That month flew by!

23:03.250 --> 23:04.500
It's been four days,

23:04.583 --> 23:07.625
but due to your heroic actions
at McDougal's Pub,

23:07.708 --> 23:10.750
I'm commuting your sentence
to time served. Bailiff!

23:11.416 --> 23:12.875
Hell yeah!

23:15.291 --> 23:16.458
-Take it outside!

23:16.541 --> 23:17.750
Come on!

23:17.833 --> 23:21.750
Next case, City of Chicago
vs. Mark and Bonnie Whiddington

23:21.833 --> 23:26.500
on the charges of public intoxication
and committing a lewd, sexual act.

23:26.583 --> 23:29.583
Oh my God! Busted!

23:29.666 --> 23:32.916
-Hey, nude and lewd! You want a beer?
-Get out!
