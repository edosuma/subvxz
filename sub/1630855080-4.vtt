WEBVTT

00:44.151 --> 00:46.487
How did you smuggle
the assassins in?

00:47.489 --> 00:49.740
You were telling anyone
that would listen

00:49.740 --> 00:52.577
that something was going on
in special housing.

00:53.036 --> 00:55.955
- Where is Berkman going?
- I don't know.

00:57.414 --> 01:00.669
Come on! Talk,
you son of a bitch! Talk!

01:01.085 --> 01:04.588
BARRY

01:04.922 --> 01:08.217
You have groceries in the fridge.
There's a half a cord of firewood.

01:08.217 --> 01:12.221
I've got zero bars.
This is perfect. Fantastic.

01:12.221 --> 01:15.057
There's no way you could talk
to the press up here.

01:15.057 --> 01:16.767
This is ridiculous.

01:16.767 --> 01:19.770
We all agree it's the best thing
for you until the trial begins.

01:19.770 --> 01:22.315
You know I can't spend
one night up here by myself.

01:22.315 --> 01:25.694
- You'll just have to make do.
- All right, I made a mistake.

01:25.694 --> 01:29.197
But can't we focus on all the stuff
I did to protect you?

01:29.197 --> 01:31.324
I guess I'm just disappointed.

01:34.493 --> 01:37.747
- Can you stay with me?
- No.

01:37.747 --> 01:40.417
Can I order Coral Tree Cafe up here?

01:50.635 --> 01:53.597
Jesus fuckin' Christ!
What is wrong with you guys?

01:53.597 --> 01:57.767
Everybody, get to their post and stay
calm! Let's keep our heads!

01:57.767 --> 01:59.685
Cousineau's not here.

02:03.022 --> 02:06.692
- Jim, I got this.
- Where's Berkman?

02:07.319 --> 02:10.195
- He can't get far.
- So, you don't have any leads?

02:10.195 --> 02:12.824
We figure he's out for a little payback
before we catch him.

02:12.824 --> 02:15.702
I'm putting units here in case
he comes looking for Cousineau.

02:15.702 --> 02:18.787
Cousineau's in Big Bear.
I'd put him there.

02:20.539 --> 02:23.460
That's nice of you.
I'll send a unit to watch over him.

02:23.460 --> 02:25.794
Berkman also has a score
to settle with NoHo Hank.

02:25.794 --> 02:28.130
An informant told us where
Hank's headquarters are.

02:28.130 --> 02:30.382
SWAT are on their way there now.

02:31.051 --> 02:33.720
We also have a unit
tailing Sally Reed.

02:36.264 --> 02:38.350
We are going to catch him, Jim.

02:38.350 --> 02:42.770
All I ask is if you find Berkman
before we do, please don't kill him.

02:43.563 --> 02:45.314
I can't promise that.

02:55.407 --> 02:58.243
- You put extra security out front?
- Yes, Hank.

02:58.243 --> 02:59.788
Okay. Add to it.

02:59.788 --> 03:02.998
- Did they have updates?
- No. Police are still searching for him.

03:02.998 --> 03:06.920
What's being done is being done.
Let's not focus on it anymore.

03:06.920 --> 03:10.090
Yeah, hard not to focus on someone
who knows I put a hit out on them.

03:10.090 --> 03:13.425
This is what happens when you hire
two guys with a podcast.

03:14.135 --> 03:15.511
Come on.

03:19.307 --> 03:22.101
Come on. We don't need these.
They're right here.

03:25.813 --> 03:29.066
Here we are.
The day has arrived.

03:30.610 --> 03:33.821
Hank and I have dreamed
of this moment for two years now.

03:33.821 --> 03:36.699
And we are so lucky
to have partners like you.

03:37.866 --> 03:42.162
Today I was considering doing a typical
site tour, but Hank had other plans.

03:42.539 --> 03:46.001
Fellas, we know you've been
busting your nuts.

03:46.667 --> 03:50.963
It's time for a little R&R,
don't you think? Enjoy!

03:58.262 --> 03:59.638
Let's go!

04:29.419 --> 04:31.920
Hey, it's Sally.
Want to run your monolog?

04:31.920 --> 04:35.132
- No, I think I'm good.
- We should run it one more time.

04:35.132 --> 04:37.844
I don't want to be in my head about
it. We've run it so many times.

04:37.844 --> 04:39.846
Sounds like
you're afraid of being shit.

04:39.846 --> 04:42.681
It's better to fail out here with me
than on the stage.

04:42.681 --> 04:43.974
Fine.

04:46.311 --> 04:47.729
Christ!

04:49.271 --> 04:50.941
The more you breathe,
the better it is,

04:50.941 --> 04:54.194
so just keep breathing and try to
ground it. Try to keep it honest.

04:54.194 --> 04:58.114
I'm gonna ask the director a question,
so you can just hang out over there.

04:59.783 --> 05:01.325
Holy shit!

05:13.003 --> 05:15.005
Oh, my god!
That's Sian Heder.

05:15.005 --> 05:17.509
You look awesome.
I'm so glad you're here.

05:19.843 --> 05:23.430
- Hi, you're Sian Heder.
- Hi.

05:24.848 --> 05:29.853
- I'm Kristen's acting coach.
- Great! I'm glad you're here.

05:33.233 --> 05:36.110
-"Coda" is a masterpiece.
- Thanks.

05:36.110 --> 05:39.864
It's incredible.
I could cry just thinking about it.

05:39.864 --> 05:42.659
I'm clearly switching gears
with this one.

05:43.076 --> 05:46.580
On Coda, I worked
with committed actors

05:46.580 --> 05:51.084
to tell a deeply personal story.
And now I'm working with models

05:51.418 --> 05:55.171
in Halloween costumes,
fighting over a blue glowy thing.

05:55.171 --> 05:57.215
- Infinity Orb.
- Orb. Yep.

05:58.465 --> 06:00.634
Well, that's exciting.

06:00.968 --> 06:03.679
Yeah. I think it's gonna
be a good movie.

06:05.055 --> 06:07.266
I think when people see "Mega Girls",

06:07.266 --> 06:10.978
they're gonna think:
"Whoever made that made Coda".

06:13.315 --> 06:15.107
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:15.107 --> 06:18.320
Sian! We have a situation over here.
Can we please see you?

06:22.240 --> 06:24.367
Hi, I'm Mark Staffordshire,
Kristen's agent.

06:24.367 --> 06:26.368
- You're the acting coach?
- Yeah.

06:28.120 --> 06:32.667
Oh, hey. Hey.
You're entitled Vagina Woman.

06:33.292 --> 06:36.462
- That's me.
- That was in every inbox.

06:37.463 --> 06:39.758
Well, glad to see
you're back on your feet.

06:40.132 --> 06:41.550
And action!

06:43.719 --> 06:49.058
The citadel was breached. If the
dragolith is not defeated, all is lost.

06:49.851 --> 06:52.186
I must go, though I shall not return.

06:53.521 --> 06:57.066
Sister, no.
It is I who will bear this burden.

06:58.068 --> 07:01.655
I am a brave woman,
and I care nothing of death.

07:02.447 --> 07:05.909
I will gladly throw my body into
the fires of Hell

07:06.241 --> 07:09.119
so that future generations may...

07:18.045 --> 07:19.464
Shit!

07:20.507 --> 07:21.966
I'm sorry. Can we cut?

07:21.966 --> 07:25.136
Please don't cut, guys,
don't nobody cut, okay?

07:25.136 --> 07:30.058
- I'm the one who yells cut.
- I'm so sorry. I have forgot the line.

07:36.314 --> 07:37.899
You're up, acting coach.

07:41.945 --> 07:44.155
Lindsay

08:04.049 --> 08:05.217
Yes?

08:05.551 --> 08:08.887
I got to the bottom of the mountain,
and my cell just leapt to life.

08:08.887 --> 08:11.932
Can't you just say, "I got service,"
like everybody else?

08:11.932 --> 08:16.980
Barry Berkman escaped from prison.
It happened sometime late yesterday.

08:17.688 --> 08:19.941
Well, he knows where this place is.

08:20.482 --> 08:22.693
I highly doubt that
he'd be going to Big Bear.

08:22.693 --> 08:25.155
You're literally on
the top of a mountain.

08:25.155 --> 08:28.032
- You got to come back and get me.
- And bring you back to LA.?

08:28.032 --> 08:30.242
No. Listen.
I just spoke with the DA

08:30.242 --> 08:33.288
and he said it was a fortunate event
that you're sequestered up there.

08:33.288 --> 08:35.664
I am a sitting fucking duck, Tom!

08:54.225 --> 08:57.478
Please! I can't. I swear to God,
I don't know anything!

08:59.105 --> 09:01.106
- Come on.
- No, no, no!

09:02.399 --> 09:05.277
- I don't know! I hate you!
- God damn it! Talk!

09:05.277 --> 09:07.405
Dang.
They're wailing on him again?

09:07.405 --> 09:11.451
He's not gonna give up Berkman, even
after that motherfucker sold him out.

09:12.494 --> 09:15.789
Please! I don't know.

09:19.167 --> 09:20.460
Damn.

09:24.838 --> 09:26.466
- Hey.
- Oh my god.

09:27.549 --> 09:29.802
- Hey, it's okay.
- It's not.

09:31.137 --> 09:32.638
Guys, what happened?

09:33.013 --> 09:37.018
I've never done this before.
I'm just really overwhelmed with it.

09:37.018 --> 09:39.937
We need to finish this scene and
move to stage 14. We have a long day.

09:39.937 --> 09:43.607
Look at me. You can do this.
Let's do a sense memory exercise.

09:43.607 --> 09:47.821
Your character is sacrificing herself.

09:47.821 --> 09:51.532
Just think of a time when you
recently sacrificed yourself.

09:53.367 --> 09:55.577
My last boyfriend was five three.

09:57.205 --> 09:59.123
- Shit.
- That's really short.

09:59.498 --> 10:02.544
You know what?
Just look at me and do this.

10:06.130 --> 10:12.429
"Sister, no!
It is I who will bear this burden."

10:13.763 --> 10:18.100
"I am not a foolish girl.
I am a brave woman."

10:19.560 --> 10:21.645
"And I care nothing of death."

10:23.273 --> 10:27.569
"I will gladly lay this body
into the fires of hell"

10:27.986 --> 10:31.197
"if it means that future generations
might live and prosper."

10:33.325 --> 10:40.539
"For that is my lot as a daughter
of this great tribe."

10:47.672 --> 10:52.384
- That was unreal.
- Thank you.

10:53.678 --> 10:58.557
Now, if I could just get
that to come out of that.

10:59.225 --> 11:00.977
Money.

11:03.604 --> 11:05.106
Okay, yeah.

11:05.106 --> 11:07.067
Can you show me what you just did?

11:16.993 --> 11:20.914
- Hank. This is amazing, huh?
- Yeah.

11:21.831 --> 11:24.042
- Are you good?
- Yeah.

11:28.128 --> 11:30.173
We are going to be fine, Hank.

11:30.799 --> 11:34.385
You got to take a moment
to recognize what you accomplished.

11:35.427 --> 11:39.557
Put your energy into that, not Barry.

11:43.937 --> 11:48.607
Hey! Who wants to see the sand?

11:49.192 --> 11:51.403
Yeah!

11:52.903 --> 11:54.406
Let's go see the sand!

11:55.239 --> 11:57.199
We're going into hostile territory,

11:57.199 --> 11:59.118
and these assholes
are packin' serious heat.

11:59.118 --> 12:02.080
Watch your back
and hit 'em hard! Y'all ready?!

12:07.084 --> 12:09.212
Police!

12:15.260 --> 12:18.638
We aren't finding any heats
on these fools. Mostly power cards.

12:18.638 --> 12:21.766
No sign of Hank or any gangsters at
all. Just a bunch of Chargers fans,

12:21.766 --> 12:24.227
and one guy in a Houston Oilers hat.

12:39.075 --> 12:43.746
All right, come on, everybody.
Hop on the sand parade.

12:43.746 --> 12:46.040
It's not like going to the beach, okay?

12:46.040 --> 12:48.959
When you see this much sand,
you're going to fucking shit yourself.

12:48.959 --> 12:51.045
Come on, you guys. Come on.

12:54.090 --> 12:57.384
This is it.
This is the whole kid and the poodle.

12:57.384 --> 12:59.054
Can I take a picture of this?

12:59.054 --> 13:02.432
- Dude, you can do sand angels.
- Oh, don't mess with me.

13:03.058 --> 13:04.476
It's so beautiful.

13:05.185 --> 13:07.978
Let's go!
Take your shoes off.

13:10.189 --> 13:11.607
Or just leave 'em on.

13:11.607 --> 13:14.735
Hey, look at this asshole
doing a sand anqel. All right.

13:16.529 --> 13:18.031
This is bananas.

13:22.202 --> 13:24.620
Feels like Scrooge McDuck
right now!

13:24.620 --> 13:27.122
Guys, what do you think?
Should we take a seffie?

13:27.122 --> 13:29.167
- Oh, yeah, selfie!
- Totally.

13:29.167 --> 13:31.461
Come on. Get in!

13:31.461 --> 13:34.964
Here we go. Ready?
Everyone say, "Sand pirates!"

13:35.423 --> 13:37.049
Sand pirates!

13:38.134 --> 13:40.052
Okay. I took a couple.
I don't know.

13:40.052 --> 13:42.013
- See what you like.
- Let me see.

13:42.388 --> 13:44.056
That is good.

13:44.056 --> 13:46.809
Hey, Cristobal!
I need your help with something, okay?

13:46.809 --> 13:49.104
Another big surprise.
But come on.

13:49.104 --> 13:51.439
- Okay. Come on.
- Okay. Hold on.

13:51.439 --> 13:54.192
Hey, Cristobal!
Wait, let me show you something.

13:54.192 --> 13:56.778
- Come here real quick.
- Okay. Quick.

14:00.574 --> 14:03.577
He's very handsome.
And see, look.

14:38.194 --> 14:39.362
Hank?

14:42.032 --> 14:44.283
Something went wrong!
Hank!

14:45.785 --> 14:47.078
What?

14:49.706 --> 14:51.750
Hank!

14:57.421 --> 14:59.215
Hank! Help me!

15:05.972 --> 15:09.517
Hank! Please!
Help me!

15:11.978 --> 15:17.817
Help! Hank! Hank!

15:46.303 --> 15:49.306
Cristobal?

15:49.682 --> 15:55.980
Oh my God!
Cristobal, hold on, I'm coming!

15:57.232 --> 15:59.733
Hold on, I'm coming!

16:02.320 --> 16:04.739
There you go.
It's okay.

16:07.242 --> 16:10.703
I'm so sorry!
I thought you were right behind me.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.499
Please, no!

16:44.570 --> 16:48.450
Good job, Hank.
Yeah, yeah, very pleased.

16:49.116 --> 16:51.661
Batir, don't you think
he did good job?

16:51.661 --> 16:54.121
I told you he'll be happy, Hank.

16:54.121 --> 17:00.045
Cristobal, we finally meet in flesh.

18:58.829 --> 19:00.164
Fuck you!

19:06.629 --> 19:08.297
"Coral Tree Cafe"

19:24.730 --> 19:28.901
Kristen's a delicate flower.
She is incredibly self-conscious,

19:28.901 --> 19:32.113
and if it was up to her, she'd stay
in Utah working for her parents.

19:32.446 --> 19:36.700
But with you,
she could actually be good.

19:38.202 --> 19:41.413
- No thanks.
- I'd start at 70 thousand a movie.

19:42.249 --> 19:45.501
You'd be able to meet the biggest
directors and producers in the business.

19:45.501 --> 19:48.546
You could get your career
back on track.

19:48.546 --> 19:52.676
I saw what you were doing back there,
trying to scoop that role. It's okay.

19:52.676 --> 19:54.511
It's commendable.

19:54.511 --> 19:58.181
I can't have you doing that
on every movie, but I can help you.

19:58.764 --> 20:05.522
I can help you get the roles, the best
roles that you are appropriate for.

20:06.982 --> 20:09.609
- I'll let you think about it.
- Thanks, Mark.

20:19.952 --> 20:22.914
- Hi. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

20:24.499 --> 20:27.543
- God! You don't know.
- Know what?

20:30.213 --> 20:35.427
Your ex escaped from prison.
I'm so sorry.

20:37.554 --> 20:40.140
You should stay with me tonight.

20:42.933 --> 20:44.603
You can't go home.

20:55.696 --> 20:58.909
- I'll be okay.
- No, you have to stay with me.

20:58.909 --> 21:02.078
- That's insane.
- Yeah, I'll be okay. Don't worry.

21:03.038 --> 21:06.332
Hey, you were great today.

21:07.958 --> 21:10.294
- I was just copying you.
- I know.

21:12.422 --> 21:15.507
But it was great.

21:19.971 --> 21:21.556
I'll see you tomorrow.

21:25.185 --> 21:30.732
You showed some real balls, Hank.
So, we give you the keys to LA.

21:32.567 --> 21:36.446
You have our men and
whatever else you need.

21:36.779 --> 21:41.701
We be like silent partners, huh?
We take our takes,

21:42.076 --> 21:47.457
but nothing like the riches
that are going to come your way.

21:48.791 --> 21:50.043
Thank you.

21:53.922 --> 21:56.882
This friend of yours,
he does not take food with us.

21:59.636 --> 22:05.350
You know, it might take him a minute
to adjust to the situation.

22:08.394 --> 22:13.942
He'll come around. He will see that
what we provide is more effective

22:13.942 --> 22:17.904
than this rainbow family
bullshit he was planning.

22:19.071 --> 22:20.490
Exactly.

22:24.369 --> 22:26.454
Cristobal!
Our friends are leaving!

22:34.461 --> 22:37.966
Cristobal, you are one of us now.

22:39.425 --> 22:41.386
Hank, he loves you,
you love Hank.

22:42.387 --> 22:48.351
As long as you are part of
Hank's family, you are part of ours.

23:16.211 --> 23:20.425
That was the only way that
made sense. If I had told you,

23:22.302 --> 23:24.387
you would have tried
to talk me out of it.

23:24.762 --> 23:26.681
We have their protection.

23:27.848 --> 23:34.146
Now we control LA just like
what we always wanted.

23:37.232 --> 23:39.318
Okay, you're upset, I get it.

23:41.571 --> 23:43.406
Let's just go to bed. Okay?

23:44.073 --> 23:50.121
I'll sleep out here. We can
just cool our jets, talk tomorrow.

23:50.121 --> 23:55.459
- You killed all those men.
- That's what's bothering you?

23:56.753 --> 23:58.420
They were our partners.

24:00.506 --> 24:03.342
Yeah, but now we have Chechens
who will die for us.

24:03.801 --> 24:07.347
- Think those guys would've done that?
- They trusted us.

24:07.347 --> 24:09.975
Right. You don't think they
would've fucked us

24:09.975 --> 24:12.226
over the first chance that they got?

24:13.477 --> 24:16.855
I think we both got blinded
by the idea of a perfect world.

24:16.855 --> 24:22.152
But it's unrealistic.
You want to be a crime lord?

24:22.945 --> 24:26.366
- Now we are crime lords.
- No, I wanted to be legitimate.

24:27.742 --> 24:32.329
When you say that word,
you sound naive.

24:38.043 --> 24:41.506
Why would you go along with
all of it if you didn't want to?

24:41.506 --> 24:44.216
I tried. I tried, for you.

24:47.177 --> 24:54.143
Again, Andrei and Batir
would've wiped us out.

24:55.519 --> 24:57.354
There was no other choice.

25:01.525 --> 25:02.985
Who are you?

25:06.113 --> 25:10.868
- I'm Hank.
- No. You're not.

25:12.369 --> 25:16.166
I feel more like myself
than I ever have.

25:17.916 --> 25:20.544
The man I love wouldn't have done
something so coldblooded.

25:20.544 --> 25:24.131
I don't understand
why you're so shocked by this.

25:24.131 --> 25:26.635
I've been keeping us safe.

25:26.635 --> 25:29.094
I would never fall in love
with a psychopath.

25:29.094 --> 25:32.973
It took a psychopath to save you
from your crazy fucking wife, okay?

25:32.973 --> 25:37.854
Now, to lead an organization like this,
you have to make the hard decisions.

25:37.854 --> 25:40.148
You have to take control
because if you don't,

25:40.148 --> 25:43.901
then you get fucking walked over,
you get taken advantage of, okay?

25:43.901 --> 25:46.905
I'm sorry, but that does not jive
with peace and love and harmony.

25:47.239 --> 25:50.199
I'm sorry. It just doesn't.
Where the fuck are you going?

25:52.202 --> 25:55.746
- Cristobal, where are you going?
- Leaving you, Hank.

25:58.416 --> 26:02.211
- You can't leave me.
- I am. I can't trust you anymore, Hank.

26:02.211 --> 26:04.965
And I don't agree with how you
want to run the business.

26:04.965 --> 26:09.218
- If you want it, keep it. It's yours.
- Cristobal. Listen to me!

26:12.472 --> 26:14.932
You can't leave me.

26:18.520 --> 26:20.063
You know too much.

26:22.856 --> 26:26.111
- Jesus.
- Come on. Let's go get a drink, okay?

26:26.570 --> 26:29.280
- Fuck you.
- I'm sorry. I got a little hot before.

26:29.656 --> 26:32.617
Hank, shut up! You are going
to let me walk to my car.

26:33.577 --> 26:35.662
You are going to let me
drive away from here,

26:35.662 --> 26:38.414
and we are never going
to speak to each other ever again.

26:38.414 --> 26:42.961
Cristobal, no. No, please, you don't
understand. You can't leave.

26:42.961 --> 26:45.922
But what you did
is completely unforgivable!

26:45.922 --> 26:49.801
You know too much, okay?
You can't leave!

26:49.801 --> 26:52.345
- Goodbye!
- No, Cristobal!

26:52.679 --> 26:55.056
Cristobal, wait.
Wait, you can't go.

26:55.056 --> 26:56.766
- Hank, stop!
- Please.

26:56.766 --> 27:00.478
- Please. I'm sorry.
- Please! Stop touching me!

27:01.563 --> 27:02.646
Leave me alone!

27:02.646 --> 27:04.732
I didn't know it was
going to go this way.

27:04.732 --> 27:06.985
- How did you think it was going to go?
- I don't know!

27:06.985 --> 27:10.655
- Leave me alone!
- I didn't think this through, okay?

27:10.655 --> 27:13.533
I'm sorry, but please don't leave.
Please, Cristobal?

27:13.533 --> 27:16.077
- Oh, god, Hank.
- Come on, please!

27:16.077 --> 27:18.370
I'll make it up to you.
I'm sorry.

27:18.787 --> 27:25.044
Listen, I'm sorry.
I love you Cristobal!

27:25.044 --> 27:29.256
It's over, Hank. It's done.

27:42.479 --> 27:46.732
Get away from me. Go.

28:45.916 --> 28:49.379
Sorry, Hank. We were hoping
that wouldn't happen.

30:01.533 --> 30:02.868
Damn!

30:30.063 --> 30:31.398
Barry?

30:44.077 --> 30:48.248
Sally, I know this is crazy,
but if I could just stay here...

30:48.248 --> 30:49.790
Let's go.

30:52.626 --> 30:53.961
Really?

31:00.676 --> 31:02.887
Let go of me!

31:03.430 --> 31:05.097
Stop it, boys!

31:06.432 --> 31:08.101
- What's going on ?
- He hit me, Dad.

31:08.101 --> 31:11.312
- You made fun of me.
- He's never heard of Call of Duty.

31:11.312 --> 31:12.938
He's a freak!

31:12.938 --> 31:16.275
Go home, John! Just go home.
Travis, come with me.

32:11.872 --> 32:13.457
I'll go talk to him.
