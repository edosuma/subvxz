00:00.000 --> 00:02.633
-You went on a trip to Florida?
-Yes, we did.

00:02.700 --> 00:06.867
These two come into the room,
belligerent, drunk, yellin' at me,

00:06.934 --> 00:09.333
foamin' at the mouth,
tried to fight me in the room.

00:10.533 --> 00:12.166
Did you have anything to drink?

00:12.233 --> 00:13.467
We had a glass of wine.

00:13.533 --> 00:15.400
-Or maybe two?
-Maybe two.

00:15.467 --> 00:17.734
[laughs]
That's-that's hysterical.

00:48.500 --> 00:50.667
[Kevin] Court, come to order.
All rise.

00:50.734 --> 00:51.734
[Judy] Be seated, please.

00:53.500 --> 00:54.567
-Good morning, Judge.
-Good morning.

00:54.633 --> 00:58.667
Case 10-39, Andrews, Hardwick
versus Young, Thompson.

01:00.066 --> 01:02.266
Can I have just the moms, please?

01:02.333 --> 01:04.433
And daughters can have a seat.

01:06.633 --> 01:09.900
So, let me tell you that
before this, I read the case.

01:09.967 --> 01:14.300
I read both of your cases, your complaint
and your answer, your counterclaim.

01:14.367 --> 01:16.800
And before I came in today,

01:16.867 --> 01:19.800
my security detail
said to me that this was

01:19.867 --> 01:22.533
what they call here
a high-security case,

01:22.600 --> 01:27.400
because there's lots of bad feeling
between your two families.

01:27.467 --> 01:29.533
So, let's agree to do this today.

01:29.600 --> 01:31.000
-[Judy] All right?
-All right.

01:31.066 --> 01:33.000
It's my job to try to make it better.

01:33.667 --> 01:36.100
And I take that job very seriously.

01:36.166 --> 01:41.300
So, let's try to keep
the level of discourse civil

01:41.367 --> 01:44.433
because there was a time
when, according to what I read,

01:44.500 --> 01:46.600
that you were all good friends. Right?

01:46.667 --> 01:47.734
Yes, Your Honor.

01:47.800 --> 01:50.867
And that's much better
than being enemies.

01:51.934 --> 01:52.934
Yes.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.333
Better for your blood
pressure... [laughs] ...right?

01:56.400 --> 01:58.600
-Better for your peace of mind.
-Yes.

01:58.667 --> 02:02.467
[Judy] The world is
in a state of panic and fear.

02:02.533 --> 02:06.467
So, we don't need to contribute
any further angst.

02:06.533 --> 02:08.200
So, let's see
if we can make it better.

02:08.700 --> 02:12.400
According to what I read, you two women
have been friends for 20 years.

02:12.467 --> 02:13.467
-[Crystal] Yes.
-We have.

02:13.533 --> 02:17.934
[Judy] So that you were actually kids
when you started to be friends.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.100
How old are you?

02:19.166 --> 02:20.333
I'm 24.

02:20.400 --> 02:21.900
Twenty-eight.

02:21.967 --> 02:23.500
-[Shakeena] Twenty-nine.
-[Judy] Okay.

02:23.567 --> 02:26.266
[Judy] And your girls,
these are your daughters?

02:26.333 --> 02:27.567
No, this is my cousin.

02:27.633 --> 02:29.333
-[Judy] Cousin.
-Those are my daughters.

02:29.400 --> 02:30.667
-[Judy] Daughters.
-[Crystal] Yeah.

02:30.734 --> 02:32.433
[Judy] They were little
and all sort of got along.

02:32.500 --> 02:36.433
You went on a trip to Florida
as a family, both of you.

02:36.500 --> 02:37.767
-Yes.
-[Judy] And your cousin?

02:37.834 --> 02:39.233
-[Ericka] Yes.
-[Judy] And your daughters?

02:39.300 --> 02:41.567
-[Crystal] Yes.
-I don't know what happened in Florida.

02:41.633 --> 02:43.900
And I don't know whether it's
gonna make it better or worse,

02:43.967 --> 02:46.333
but I have to have
some sort of background.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.800
If you went on a trip to Florida together,

02:48.867 --> 02:51.567
and you live, according to
your papers, in Philadelphia?

02:51.633 --> 02:52.633
Yes.

02:52.700 --> 02:54.533
When did you go on the trip to Florida?

02:54.600 --> 02:57.266
We went on a trip
for Florida for Christmas.

02:57.333 --> 02:59.934
We left December the 23rd.

03:00.066 --> 03:02.400
And was it just this group that went?

03:02.467 --> 03:05.200
No, it was actually a group of 21 of us.

03:05.266 --> 03:07.834
I had a party of 17 on my own.

03:07.900 --> 03:09.367
[Judy] And how many people
were in your party?

03:09.433 --> 03:11.400
Myself and my four daughters.

03:11.467 --> 03:13.066
[Judy] Did you all stay
at the same hotel?

03:13.133 --> 03:14.800
-[Ericka] Yes, we did.
-[Crystal] Just not in the same building.

03:14.867 --> 03:16.300
-[Judy] But in the same hotel?
-[Crystal] Yes.

03:16.367 --> 03:20.100
[Judy] You want to start telling me
about the incident in Florida

03:20.166 --> 03:22.800
that started this negativity going?

03:22.867 --> 03:25.000
I was the one to ask everybody

03:25.066 --> 03:27.834
did they want Shakeena
to pay off one card,

03:27.900 --> 03:29.934
then everybody pay in separately.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.633
We all was in agreement of saying yes.

03:32.700 --> 03:34.967
Everybody agreed to put it
on one credit card--

03:35.033 --> 03:37.767
uncross your hands because-- better.

03:37.834 --> 03:40.834
So, it was agreed to put it
on your cousin's credit card.

03:40.900 --> 03:42.233
-Yes.
-[Judy] And everybody would pay...

03:42.300 --> 03:43.900
...for their share.
Okay, go ahead.

03:43.967 --> 03:47.433
Okay. So, that night,
I collect everyone's money.

03:47.500 --> 03:49.633
That night, we were all in my apartment

03:49.700 --> 03:51.200
'cause they lived in another building.

03:51.266 --> 03:55.233
We all was agreeing to pay
Shakeena the $26 per person.

03:55.300 --> 03:56.800
And what did that cover?

03:56.867 --> 04:01.066
It cover, we did aquarium
and a museum.

04:01.133 --> 04:02.700
Okay.
And that was just the tickets?

04:02.767 --> 04:04.066
That was just for the tickets, yes.

04:04.133 --> 04:05.133
[Judy] Okay, great.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.100
So, that was just tickets
for those two functions.

04:07.166 --> 04:09.300
And that was that day
or the next day?

04:09.367 --> 04:11.533
That-that was on December the 26th.

04:11.600 --> 04:13.500
Okay, so you were in,
and there were no incidents

04:13.567 --> 04:16.333
between December 23rd
and December 26th?

04:16.400 --> 04:17.633
Uh, no.

04:17.700 --> 04:20.166
So, everything was,
was everything fine between

04:20.233 --> 04:21.300
the 23rd and the 26th?

04:21.367 --> 04:23.734
-No, ma'am. It was not.
-[Judy] Okay.

04:23.800 --> 04:27.066
So, you think that difficulty
started before the 26th?

04:27.133 --> 04:30.000
Actually, the difficulty started
once we arrived.

04:30.066 --> 04:34.734
It was a shift in Mrs. Andrews'
demeanor and attitude.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.266
At the airport, we were sisters.

04:36.333 --> 04:37.967
We took pictures.
We were sisters.

04:38.033 --> 04:41.367
It was a-a warm greeting.
Once we arrived in Florida,

04:41.433 --> 04:44.166
her whole demeanor changed,
her whole everything changed.

04:44.233 --> 04:48.266
The first day we arrived, I wanted
to take her son, Jalen, out to the pool.

04:48.333 --> 04:50.333
She told me no, Jalen couldn't go.

04:50.400 --> 04:52.633
Before, prior before that,
she already took Jalen away from me.

04:52.700 --> 04:54.166
We were, you know,
we've been dealing with,

04:54.233 --> 04:55.233
we raised our kids together.

04:55.300 --> 04:57.500
We have a long history
in raising our kids together.

04:57.567 --> 05:00.700
Uh, once we got there,
Miss Andrews and her party,

05:00.767 --> 05:03.000
everyone that she invited in her party,

05:03.066 --> 05:05.133
you know, it was just--
the whole demeanor just changed.

05:05.200 --> 05:07.467
Her whole demeanor changed.
She started treating me nasty.

05:07.533 --> 05:08.600
[Judy] Just a second.

05:08.667 --> 05:11.633
But that was so unlike her,
according to what you tell me.

05:11.700 --> 05:14.266
Yeah, it's deeper than that,
than just this trip.

05:14.333 --> 05:16.900
[Judy] Okay. Did you think that
there was any jealousy?

05:16.967 --> 05:18.934
From the way I feel,
I'm going to be honest,

05:19.000 --> 05:22.333
I've always felt like she had
some jealousy towards me.

05:22.400 --> 05:23.934
[Judy] But managed
to keep it in check?

05:24.000 --> 05:25.333
No, ma'am.
I felt like she was my friend.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.834
I felt like we were family
more than just friends, but family.

05:27.900 --> 05:30.333
So... and sometimes,
family gets annoyed with family.

05:30.400 --> 05:32.567
[Crystal] What I mean is,
I-I'm just saying,

05:32.633 --> 05:33.934
it can go both ways
between the both of us.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.400
Okay. So I mean, the case is,

05:37.467 --> 05:40.734
each one of you is claiming assault
by the other and your kids,

05:40.800 --> 05:43.900
and vandalism of your property
and harassment.

05:43.967 --> 05:45.633
I have that from both of you.

05:45.700 --> 05:47.567
-That's what the case is about.
-[Crystal] Yeah.

05:47.633 --> 05:50.367
And I'm trying to get to
what happened.

05:50.433 --> 05:54.734
So, you got a sense that
she changed in her attitude

05:54.800 --> 05:56.967
from the time you left the airport

05:57.033 --> 05:58.834
until the time you landed in Florida,

05:58.900 --> 06:00.633
there was something wrong.

06:00.700 --> 06:02.000
You knew that you
didn't do anything wrong.

06:02.066 --> 06:03.066
Yes.

06:03.133 --> 06:04.967
Did something happen,
Miss Andrews,

06:05.033 --> 06:10.200
on the flight or at the airport,
that rubbed you the wrong way?

06:10.266 --> 06:13.266
No, Your Honor.
We had a wonderful flight.

06:13.333 --> 06:15.800
I have pictures
that we enjoyed ourselves.

06:15.867 --> 06:18.200
I cooked Christmas dinner
for everyone.

06:18.266 --> 06:19.967
Everyone came to my condo.

06:20.033 --> 06:23.000
These young ladies
was at my condo every day.

06:23.066 --> 06:25.500
I had no idea that nothing was wrong.

06:25.567 --> 06:26.567
Okay. And, you know,

06:26.633 --> 06:29.367
you had this large group
of 17 together.

06:29.934 --> 06:31.867
Was that emotionally draining,

06:31.934 --> 06:34.533
having to run herd on 17 people?

06:34.600 --> 06:36.934
No, because everyone
was, they were grown,

06:37.000 --> 06:39.500
with their own children
or grandchildren.

06:39.567 --> 06:41.800
So, I didn't see anything
out of the ordinary.

06:41.867 --> 06:44.200
Everybody was there
with their children.

06:44.266 --> 06:48.700
Okay, so you didn't have
any negative feelings at that time

06:48.767 --> 06:49.900
-towards the defendant.
-Not at all.

06:49.967 --> 06:52.734
[Judy] And do you remember
the incident she's talking about

06:52.800 --> 06:55.433
when she wanted to take
your son to the pool?

06:55.500 --> 06:57.367
Well, that was actually
before the 26th,

06:57.433 --> 07:00.133
and at that time, someone
who went on a trip was,

07:00.200 --> 07:02.433
that was at my party,
had an accident

07:02.500 --> 07:04.767
with their grandchild with the pool.

07:04.834 --> 07:07.433
So, at that time,
we were already waiting

07:07.500 --> 07:10.700
to resolve the issue
about a little person

07:10.767 --> 07:12.633
having an incident
in the pool with us.

07:12.700 --> 07:15.633
So, at that time, we wasn't
not into going out or anything.

07:15.700 --> 07:17.900
There wasn't no attitude.
I just said he couldn't go.

07:17.967 --> 07:18.967
[Judy] Okay.

07:19.033 --> 07:21.266
[â™ª dramatic music]

07:21.333 --> 07:23.133
These two come into the room.

07:23.200 --> 07:24.800
I couldn't understand
nothing she was saying.

07:24.867 --> 07:26.400
She was belligerent, drunk,

07:26.467 --> 07:28.567
yellin' at me, foamin' at the mouth,

07:28.633 --> 07:30.100
and she tried to fight me in the room.

07:30.166 --> 07:33.433
So, now I'm seeing
that something not good

07:33.500 --> 07:35.600
happened in Florida.

07:36.266 --> 07:37.266
[â™ª dramatic music]

07:40.567 --> 07:43.800
[â™ª dramatic music]

[Narrator] <i>Ericka Andrews</i>
<i>and her cousin</i>

07:48.200 --> 07:51.100
<i>Shakeena Hardrick</i>
<i>claim their former friends,</i>

07:51.166 --> 07:53.033
<i>Crystal Young and her daughters,</i>

07:53.100 --> 07:56.066

07:56.133 --> 07:58.467

07:58.533 --> 08:00.100

08:00.166 --> 08:01.700
So, somebody in your party

08:01.767 --> 08:04.066
had a little child who had
an accident in the pool?

08:04.133 --> 08:06.533
Yeah, she almost drowned
in the pool, so, you know,

08:06.600 --> 08:09.567
we just stayed in the room
until we heard how the baby

08:09.633 --> 08:12.700
was going to do before we
started going out on activities.

08:12.767 --> 08:15.800
Mind you, which that was
the first day we got there.

08:15.867 --> 08:17.433
So, what Crys--
what's Young just talking about,

08:17.500 --> 08:19.867
that was a-- during that time,
we just said no,

08:19.934 --> 08:22.767
we put all the kids in one room
with my children,

08:22.834 --> 08:25.967
and we went to the hospital.
That's how that went.

08:26.033 --> 08:27.433
Can I please speak on that?

08:27.500 --> 08:29.300
We arrived on the 23rd.

08:29.367 --> 08:31.066
The 23rd, once we arrived,

08:31.133 --> 08:32.967
we all were checked in the resort.

08:33.033 --> 08:34.700
After we all got settled in,

08:34.767 --> 08:36.834
I went over to Miss Andrews' room,
which is on the 23rd.

08:36.900 --> 08:39.667
The baby actually
had the accident on the 24th,

08:39.734 --> 08:41.166
the very next day.

08:41.233 --> 08:43.233
This particular day I'm talking
about was the day we arrived.

08:43.300 --> 08:46.300
When I went over there and asked
her, "Oh, no, Jalen has homework.

08:46.367 --> 08:47.867
My son has to this, he has to do that,"

08:47.934 --> 08:49.633
and this was her words exactly.

08:49.700 --> 08:51.734
Normally when we arrive on vacation,

08:51.800 --> 08:53.633
we normally rest the first day.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.533
I said okay, I left.

08:55.600 --> 08:56.967
I went back to my room,

08:57.033 --> 08:58.166
my youngest daughter, which is 10,

08:58.233 --> 08:59.734
and my other daughter,
my third daughter,

08:59.800 --> 09:02.633
which she thought not to mention,
we all went down to the pool.

09:02.700 --> 09:04.333
The next day, this is when this incident

09:04.400 --> 09:07.600
that she's saying that happened
which was on the 24th, with the baby.

09:07.667 --> 09:10.700
[Judy] Okay, so,
something was brewing.

09:10.767 --> 09:13.500
At least from your end,
something was brewing.

09:13.567 --> 09:17.934
Did anything more definitive
happen during this vacation?

09:18.000 --> 09:20.600
It was the way how she was
talking to me, talking down to me,

09:20.667 --> 09:22.433
like I guess I was
one of her kids or anything,

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
one of her children or something.

09:24.066 --> 09:25.900
You know, uh, uh, I'm very respectful.

09:25.967 --> 09:27.533
Because she gets around
a lot of people,

09:27.600 --> 09:29.066
Ms. Andrews likes to showboat
and show off

09:29.133 --> 09:31.567
and talk to people any kind of way,
talk down to you,

09:31.633 --> 09:33.867
think that she's your boss,
she likes to run everything.

09:33.934 --> 09:35.433
But she cannot run me.

09:35.500 --> 09:38.300
If I paid my money to go on the trip,
I'm gonna do exactly what I want to do.

09:38.367 --> 09:40.700
She's not going to tell me,
that she's not my leader.

09:40.767 --> 09:43.266
-I'm a woman just like she is.
-[Judy] Got it.

09:43.333 --> 09:45.734
So, aside from attitude problem,

09:45.800 --> 09:48.767
there wasn't an overt argument?

09:48.834 --> 09:51.900
It's been plenty of arguments,
but I've just been stayin' my distance.

09:51.967 --> 09:56.100
But nothing like what I'm
hearing about when you came home?

09:56.166 --> 09:58.633
Each day, it was something else
brewing more and more.

09:58.700 --> 10:02.133
So, each day, you were getting
more and more annoyed.

10:02.200 --> 10:04.133
No, I wasn't annoyed.
She was annoyed.

10:04.200 --> 10:07.100
I just said I was gonna stay my distance
'cause I came to have a good time.

10:07.166 --> 10:09.567
[Judy] You felt it was the plaintiff

10:09.633 --> 10:12.834
whose actions were
getting more dominating?

10:12.900 --> 10:13.900
Yes.

10:13.967 --> 10:14.967
[Judy]
But you kept going to her room?

10:15.033 --> 10:16.033
[Crystal] No.

10:16.100 --> 10:17.433
[Judy]
Did you have meals together?

10:17.500 --> 10:18.934
Only time we had a meal together,

10:19.000 --> 10:21.367
I came over was
on that Christmas Day,

10:21.433 --> 10:23.533
she asked me to make
the macaroni and tuna salad.

10:23.600 --> 10:24.867
I offered to make something else.

10:24.934 --> 10:27.633
She said, "No, just make macaroni
and tuna. We're doing the dinner,"

10:27.700 --> 10:29.800
'cause it was a lot of other people
involved in the dinner.

10:29.867 --> 10:32.867
I came over, we all came over
to have the Christmas dinner.

10:32.934 --> 10:35.166
The feeling was not very comfortable,

10:35.233 --> 10:37.500
was not like-- I just ate and left.

10:37.567 --> 10:39.667
[Judy] Now, you
came back from vacation,

10:39.734 --> 10:42.834
and I want you to get
to December the 30th,

10:42.900 --> 10:45.967
which is what the first incident here
we're talking about,

10:46.033 --> 10:47.834
which is when that occurred.

10:47.900 --> 10:49.967
I left the trip on December the 28th.

10:50.033 --> 10:52.266
-[Judy] Was that a planned departure date?
-[Crystal] No.

10:52.333 --> 10:54.266
[Judy] What was your planned
departure date?

10:54.333 --> 10:56.800
Originally, I was gonna
leave on the 27th,

10:56.867 --> 10:59.200
but my daughter and niece
arrived on the 27th,

10:59.266 --> 11:01.533
so I said I'll give it one
more night, and stay with her.

11:01.600 --> 11:03.533
I was going back because
I had to go back to work.

11:03.600 --> 11:04.734
And when did you leave?

11:04.800 --> 11:06.266
I left December the 30th.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.300
-So, you were home a couple of days...
-Yes.

11:08.367 --> 11:10.100
...before plaintiff got home.

11:10.166 --> 11:11.967
I want you to tell me in your words,

11:12.033 --> 11:15.333
but I want it to be
this level of discourse.

11:15.400 --> 11:16.567
You know what I'm talking about?

11:16.633 --> 11:18.233
-Yeah.
-[Judy] Not angry.

11:18.300 --> 11:20.567
-Yes.
-'Cause life's too short.

11:20.633 --> 11:24.333
You both seem like nice people.
Life's too short.

11:24.400 --> 11:27.633
It's ridiculous to have
this kind of behavior

11:27.700 --> 11:31.433
that I'm reading about
from nice people with nice families.

11:31.500 --> 11:34.633
They plan vacations together.
Someone should keep it down.

11:34.700 --> 11:36.834
Tell me what happened
on December the 30th.

11:36.900 --> 11:40.533
The December the 30th, we,
they were already arrived.

11:40.600 --> 11:44.467
So, everybody was home before me
and my children arrived home.

11:44.533 --> 11:47.500
We didn't get home
till about five o'clock that evening.

11:47.567 --> 11:51.567
We got out of our lift,
and we went into my home.

11:51.633 --> 11:53.433
We shut the door.

11:53.500 --> 11:56.200
I never seen none of these
people outside or anything.

11:56.266 --> 11:59.033
Like if they were waiting
for me and my children

11:59.100 --> 12:00.567
to go into the house.

12:00.633 --> 12:02.900
We went into the house,
we shut our door.

12:02.967 --> 12:07.734
Maybe about three minutes later,
I hear this banging on my door,

12:07.800 --> 12:11.266
which it was Inisa Thomas-Young.

12:11.333 --> 12:12.900
She was the one
banging on my door.

12:12.967 --> 12:14.166
I looked out the door.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.967
All of them were standing
around with a group of people.

12:17.033 --> 12:19.400
Stand up. You're Inisa?

12:19.467 --> 12:20.667
Yes, I'm Inisa.

12:20.734 --> 12:24.266
Inisa, tell me who you
were with on December 30th?

12:24.333 --> 12:28.000
December 30th,
um, I was at my two sisters'.

12:28.066 --> 12:29.800
Um, my mom--

12:29.867 --> 12:30.934
I wasn't there. I was at home.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.900
Oh, yeah, she was.

12:32.967 --> 12:36.967
[Judy] And what were you
going to the plaintiff's house for?

12:37.033 --> 12:38.400
I wasn't going to her house.

12:38.467 --> 12:40.166
I went home to my sister's house.

12:40.233 --> 12:41.600
They was already waiting for me.

12:41.667 --> 12:42.800
[Judy] And then what happened?

12:42.867 --> 12:44.367
They were outside
when I pulled up,

12:44.433 --> 12:47.633
and they started, Shakeena,
she was talking trash.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.233
It was her
and her younger daughter.

12:49.300 --> 12:50.367
They were talking trash
while I was--

12:50.433 --> 12:51.500
-[Judy] Shh-shh.
-I'm sorry.

12:51.567 --> 12:54.767
While I understand vaguely
what that means,

12:54.834 --> 12:59.033
I would like you to tell me
what was said, not "talking trash."

12:59.100 --> 13:00.300
What was said?

13:00.367 --> 13:03.867
You come home
and you see this young lady here,

13:03.934 --> 13:05.567
and who was she there with?

13:05.633 --> 13:06.867
[Inisa] It was a bunch of 'em.

13:06.934 --> 13:08.867
Like, it was a lot of people
from the trip.

13:08.934 --> 13:10.834
[Judy] Okay. And your neighbors.

13:10.900 --> 13:13.133
So, there were people there
from the trip,

13:13.200 --> 13:15.433
and describe
what they were saying.

13:15.500 --> 13:18.233
-I don't understand.
-If I can go back because I didn't ge--

13:18.300 --> 13:21.233
I didn't come on the trip on the 23rd,
I came the 27th.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.400
[Judy] I know that.

13:22.467 --> 13:24.533
And when I came,
it was a lot of tension between,

13:24.600 --> 13:26.333
like they would just,
I came in the room.

13:26.400 --> 13:28.433
I came into her room,
and I spoke to everybody

13:28.500 --> 13:29.934
and like I felt the energy

13:30.000 --> 13:31.867
that people really
didn't want to speak to me,

13:31.934 --> 13:33.166
but I didn't pay it no mind.

13:33.233 --> 13:35.567
So, December 29th,

13:35.633 --> 13:37.467
the last night before
the flight went out,

13:37.533 --> 13:39.166
we went,
me and my younger sister,

13:39.233 --> 13:43.133
we went to a mutual friend's
room to play some cards.

13:43.200 --> 13:45.967
And we was playing spades,
and we needed one more player.

13:46.033 --> 13:48.600
So, I actually went
to her daughter's room

13:48.667 --> 13:51.767
to see if her daughter
wanted to come be my partner.

13:51.834 --> 13:53.233
And she was actually packing up

13:53.300 --> 13:55.000
to get ready to go back to Philly.

13:55.066 --> 13:56.633
That's when she came in the room,

13:56.700 --> 14:00.166
and she was mad about the comps
that the hotel gave her

14:00.233 --> 14:01.867
in regards to the little girl, Joanna,

14:01.934 --> 14:04.300
she felt that she should have
got more than a gift card,

14:04.367 --> 14:07.066
and she was talking about it,
and then that's what she said,

14:07.133 --> 14:08.867
"Inisa, I want to ask you something,"

14:08.934 --> 14:12.834
about the argument that aspired
between Tache and her.

14:12.900 --> 14:14.900
Okay. I didn't know
about that argument.

14:14.967 --> 14:16.367
And before
she even asked me a question,

14:16.433 --> 14:20.333
I said, "I wasn't there,
but from what I heard, you know,

14:20.400 --> 14:21.834
she shouldn't have said
what she say

14:21.900 --> 14:23.467
because like that's rude, basically."

14:23.533 --> 14:25.600
And everyone in the room agreed
with me except for her,

14:25.667 --> 14:27.633
she yelling, she was
talking about my mom,

14:27.700 --> 14:29.166
she was just throwing,
like, little shots,

14:29.233 --> 14:31.000
and I already knew
where it was coming from.

14:31.066 --> 14:33.734
So, her daughter was packing,
she couldn't go play cards with me.

14:33.800 --> 14:36.033
So, I, we just left.
Me and my younger sister, we left,

14:36.100 --> 14:39.367
and we went to the mutual party's room
to go finish playing cards.

14:39.433 --> 14:40.900
So, like an hour go past,

14:40.967 --> 14:43.934
she calls the mutual party phone.
"Don't let them little girls

14:44.000 --> 14:46.233
be upstairs talking trash about me,"
duh duh duh duh.

14:46.300 --> 14:48.166
I'm like, "What are you
talking about?"

14:48.233 --> 14:51.166
And then, two hours later,
it's like two o'clock in the morning.

14:51.233 --> 14:53.700
Like, we drinking, we, everybody
hanging out, having a good time.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.800
These two come into the room.

14:55.867 --> 14:57.500
I couldn't understand
nothing she was sayin'.

14:57.567 --> 14:58.767
And she was belligerent, drunk,

14:58.834 --> 15:01.233
yellin' at me, foamin' at the mouth.

15:01.300 --> 15:03.200
Shakeena, she gonna say,

15:03.266 --> 15:06.400
"Oh, I'm here because I heard
she had my name in her mouth,

15:06.467 --> 15:07.934
she had my name in her mouth."

15:08.000 --> 15:09.834
And I'm confused, and I'm just like,

15:09.900 --> 15:11.734
Where is this all this even coming from?

15:11.800 --> 15:13.567
And she tried to fight me in the room.

15:13.633 --> 15:15.000
Security had to come.

15:15.066 --> 15:20.767
Okay. So, now I'm seeing that something
not good happened in Florida.

15:20.834 --> 15:23.767
[â™ª dramatic music]

15:23.834 --> 15:26.266
Shakeena and Ericka
comin' out snapping with me.

15:26.333 --> 15:29.200
"Where's Tache at?
She better have my... money."

15:29.266 --> 15:32.700
They just, like, looking at Inisa,
so, yeah, I'm confused

15:32.767 --> 15:34.800
'cause like I said, we are like family.

15:34.867 --> 15:36.934
I'm like, I hope they ain't
doing this over $26.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.500
Like, you cannot be serious.

15:38.567 --> 15:41.834
[â™ª dramatic music]

15:50.000 --> 15:52.934
[Narrator] <i>After being friends</i>
<i>and neighbors for years,</i>

15:53.000 --> 15:55.500
<i>Ericka Andrews and her cousin</i>
<i>Shakeena Hardrick</i>

15:55.567 --> 15:58.100
<i>have accused Crystal Young</i>
<i>and her daughters</i>

15:58.166 --> 16:01.166
<i>of assaulting them</i>
<i>and vandalizing their property.</i>

16:01.233 --> 16:06.500
So, now, I'm seeing that something
not good happened in Florida,

16:06.567 --> 16:09.633
because now there's a fight in Florida,

16:09.700 --> 16:11.133
almost the last day that you're leaving.

16:11.200 --> 16:12.200
It's actually the second one.

16:12.266 --> 16:13.734
Like it's probably like--

16:13.800 --> 16:15.000
[Judy] Second fight.

16:15.066 --> 16:16.767
Did they all occur in the evening?

16:16.834 --> 16:18.233
This was like
two o'clock in the morning.

16:18.300 --> 16:19.433
[Judy] Morning, okay.

16:19.500 --> 16:24.567
Everybody have a glass of wine or two,
or a beer or something?

16:24.633 --> 16:27.433
I'm not saying anybody was drunk.

16:27.500 --> 16:31.467
I'm just saying,
did everybody who was around

16:31.533 --> 16:33.734
have something to drink?

16:34.734 --> 16:35.967
Nothing.

16:36.033 --> 16:38.133
Are you saying you didn't
have anything to drink?

16:38.200 --> 16:41.100
No, I was not, mm-mm.
I was in my room asleep.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.667
-[Judy] You were sleeping.
-Mm-hmm.

16:43.734 --> 16:45.333
You've got an attitude.

16:46.667 --> 16:47.900
[laughter]

16:49.100 --> 16:50.433
Did you have anything to drink?

16:50.500 --> 16:53.867
Yeah, me and her mother
and my-my, the other,

16:53.934 --> 16:55.700
another party that was
at the trip with us.

16:55.767 --> 16:57.400
We were coming from Applebee's.

16:57.467 --> 16:59.300
Okay, so you'd had something to drink?

16:59.367 --> 17:02.533
Yeah, we had dinner and we had
a-a glass of wine at the Applebee's.

17:02.600 --> 17:04.166
-[Judy] Or maybe two?
-Maybe two.

17:04.233 --> 17:05.233
[Judy] Okay.

17:05.300 --> 17:06.633
[laughter]

17:06.700 --> 17:09.400
[Judy] You know what happens
with one or maybe two,

17:09.467 --> 17:12.266
inhibitions kind of go out the window.

17:12.333 --> 17:13.500
What about your team?

17:13.567 --> 17:14.600
I had left on the 28th.

17:14.667 --> 17:16.233
This happened on the 29th.

17:16.300 --> 17:18.967
So, you weren't there?
Had you had anything to drink?

17:19.033 --> 17:21.266
I was drinking with a party downstairs.

17:21.333 --> 17:22.800
Okay, so the answer is yes.

17:22.867 --> 17:25.600
-Yes.
-That's always a bad thing.

17:25.667 --> 17:26.767
You left--?

17:26.834 --> 17:29.500
I left on the 30th, but when
that incident took place,

17:29.567 --> 17:32.266
I was not there 'cause
we had my younger sister, she's 10.

17:32.333 --> 17:34.633
I couldn't leave her in a room
unsupervised,

17:34.700 --> 17:35.967
so I stayed with her that night.

17:36.033 --> 17:37.367
-[Judy] And no alcohol?
-No alcohol.

17:37.433 --> 17:39.500
I was sleeping in the room
with my 10-year-old sister.

17:39.567 --> 17:42.233
Okay, so on the 30th,
now you're back.

17:42.300 --> 17:44.033
Go ahead. Pick it up from there.

17:44.100 --> 17:46.567
Your Honor, it's like so much
missed out at the beginning

17:46.633 --> 17:49.834
because this young lady was sent
down here to start with Shakeena

17:49.900 --> 17:52.800
because the argument started
with Tache, and she came there.

17:52.867 --> 17:55.200
So, she came
at the last day of the trip.

17:55.266 --> 17:58.000
That's why she stayed
an extra day 'cause she came.

17:58.066 --> 17:59.800
So, that part right there,

17:59.867 --> 18:01.900
they just totally
made that whole thing up.

18:01.967 --> 18:04.700
But why don't you stand
up and let-- have a seat.

18:04.767 --> 18:07.767
Why don't you stand up
and let me try to sort out

18:07.834 --> 18:11.967
what it was that started this
argument between the two of you?

18:12.033 --> 18:13.367
So, you want me to speak?

18:13.433 --> 18:15.734
-[Judy] Yes.
-Okay, so, um, with...

18:15.800 --> 18:17.667
the incident took place
between me and Shakeena--

18:17.734 --> 18:19.133
honestly, I'm keeping eyes with you

18:19.200 --> 18:22.567
was instigated
because of Ericka, honestly.

18:22.633 --> 18:23.633
It was a small incident.

18:23.700 --> 18:25.834
Shh, just tell me what happened.

18:25.900 --> 18:28.800
Okay, so, all right, like I said,
the incident with the child,

18:28.867 --> 18:30.900
it was a drownin',
and, you know, the party--

18:30.967 --> 18:32.867
You have to talk very slowly.

18:32.934 --> 18:34.066
Okay, I talk fast.

18:34.133 --> 18:36.433
So, um, it was an incident
with the child was a drownin'.

18:36.500 --> 18:37.667
-So, everybody--
-[Judy] There was an incident.

18:37.734 --> 18:39.000
I didn't understand that.

18:39.066 --> 18:41.200
It was an incident with a child,
which was a drowning,

18:41.266 --> 18:44.800
and, um, when that took place,
nobody didn't really do nothing.

18:44.867 --> 18:46.867
Everybody on the trip was dealing it out.

18:46.934 --> 18:48.900
Once the little girl
got to the hospital,

18:48.967 --> 18:50.266
that was like around Christmas Day,

18:50.333 --> 18:53.000
that's when everybody,
um, we had like a dinner,

18:53.066 --> 18:54.400
um, at Ericka's house.

18:54.467 --> 18:57.900
So, they took it upon their selves.
They didn't tell us.

18:57.967 --> 19:00.066
Ericka is very controlling, very bossy.

19:00.133 --> 19:02.734
She took it behind herself,
mind you, on the Groupon app,

19:02.800 --> 19:04.333
I have Groupon in my phone.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.433
I could have paid
$26 for my own ticket.

19:06.500 --> 19:09.900
She just did it behind.
So, say I booked this, whatever,

19:09.967 --> 19:11.000
everybody give Shakeena her money.

19:11.066 --> 19:12.934
So, I said,
"I'm, I have cash in my room,

19:13.000 --> 19:15.300
I'm just gonna give her
the cash in the morning."

19:15.367 --> 19:17.934
So, I-I had the cash in my hand,

19:18.000 --> 19:22.133
and I just see Shakeena and Ericka
coming out, snapping on me.

19:22.200 --> 19:23.500
"Where is Tache at?

19:23.567 --> 19:26.633
She better have my... money,"
blasÃ© blasÃ© blasÃ©.

19:26.700 --> 19:28.700
They just like literally
like raising hell, so yeah,

19:28.767 --> 19:31.934
I'm confused 'cause like I said,
we are like family.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.100
I'm like, I hope they ain't
doing this over $26.

19:34.166 --> 19:36.033
Like, you cannot be serious.

19:36.100 --> 19:38.200
So, you know what I'm talking about?
And, like...

19:38.266 --> 19:40.834
You be tryin' to call, say we're petty,
we didn't send it through?

19:40.900 --> 19:43.800
But who's the petty ones
that dragged this on for $26?

19:44.000 --> 19:45.100
Let's keep that real.

19:45.166 --> 19:47.233
Who-who-who really--
you draggin' us to court?

19:47.300 --> 19:49.166
Who really look bad?

19:49.233 --> 19:51.467
Shh, is that what she said
that was nasty about you?

19:51.533 --> 19:53.967
Yeah, but they have my... money,
they not playin' with me.

19:54.033 --> 19:55.934
Got it, sit down.
Got it. Sit down.

19:56.100 --> 19:57.767
-[Tache] Okay.
-Your Honor--

19:57.834 --> 19:58.867
[Judy] Did you say?

19:58.934 --> 20:00.100
No, I did not say that.

20:00.166 --> 20:01.166
[Judy] What did you say?

20:01.233 --> 20:02.633
I didn't really say anything.

20:02.700 --> 20:04.934
What she thought I said,
what she heard I said--

20:05.000 --> 20:06.834
as I was coming out
of my hotel room,

20:06.900 --> 20:08.300
Ericka was not with me.

20:08.367 --> 20:10.033
I was walking with my aunt

20:10.100 --> 20:12.867
who was on a trip with us,
and my son, Samir.

20:12.934 --> 20:15.533
And she thought she heard me say,

20:15.600 --> 20:16.834
"Well, how are they at the bus?"

20:17.000 --> 20:20.333
'Cause we had got transportation
to take us to the events.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.567
She thought that she heard me say,

20:22.633 --> 20:24.734
"How they at the bus before us,

20:24.800 --> 20:26.633
and they didn't even
give me my money yet?"

20:26.700 --> 20:29.967
So, when I came downstairs, when I
finally got down to the ground floor

20:30.033 --> 20:32.200
where they were standing at
in front of the bus,

20:32.266 --> 20:34.667
Tache was like, "Oh, Shakeena,

20:34.734 --> 20:38.133
you said Tache didn't
give you my money.

20:38.200 --> 20:40.700
I never liked you anyway, I--"

20:40.767 --> 20:41.934
She called me a...
[dipped audio]

20:42.000 --> 20:44.400
"I've been wanting
to beat you up for years."

20:44.467 --> 20:46.433
Mind you, me and her
used to be best friends.

20:46.500 --> 20:49.000
We stopped being best friends
eight years ago

20:49.066 --> 20:50.400
when I got pregnant with my son,

20:50.467 --> 20:53.934
because Tache was high drama then,
always in drama.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.800
And once I got pregnant with my son,

20:55.867 --> 20:57.367
I just had to change my life around

20:57.433 --> 21:00.834
so I couldn't be out in the street
doing those types of things.

21:00.900 --> 21:02.567
So, she's always been high drama,

21:02.633 --> 21:04.233
and I always felt like we had tension

21:04.300 --> 21:07.033
from the moment we stopped
being friends eight years ago.

21:07.100 --> 21:09.166
Even though we kept it civil,

21:09.233 --> 21:11.000
there was never no exchange of words

21:11.066 --> 21:13.333
when we seen each other,
but I always felt like

21:13.400 --> 21:15.800
she had an underlying
tension for me.

21:15.867 --> 21:18.166
But I always kept
a respectful relationship

21:18.233 --> 21:20.133
between her mom and her sisters.

21:20.200 --> 21:23.767
So, it shocked me
when Inisa came down on the 29th,

21:23.834 --> 21:25.734
and she came down stirring drama.

21:25.800 --> 21:27.233
Now, mind you,
I'm in my room asleep,

21:27.300 --> 21:29.900
but she was in my cousin's room
that was adjacent to us,

21:29.967 --> 21:32.700
saying how I don't have no job

21:32.767 --> 21:35.500
and why I'm being petty over $26,

21:35.567 --> 21:38.400
and I better keep the same energy
when I get back to Philly

21:38.700 --> 21:40.233
because it's going to be
a one-on-one fight

21:40.300 --> 21:41.800
between me and her sister.

21:41.867 --> 21:44.867
-Even prior to that--
-[Judy] Shhh, got it.

21:44.934 --> 21:47.066
I got it. Sit.

21:48.066 --> 21:49.066
Sit.

21:51.066 --> 21:52.734
No attitude.

21:52.800 --> 21:53.834
No attitude.

21:53.900 --> 21:56.900
Take a huge breath.

21:59.800 --> 22:01.433
So, your son is about 8?

22:01.500 --> 22:03.967
Yes, he will be 8 in April.

22:04.033 --> 22:05.533
Does he ever give you attitude?

22:05.600 --> 22:07.467
Oh, yes. He's a Taurus, like me.

22:07.533 --> 22:09.633
[laughs]

22:09.700 --> 22:12.467
Okay, it may be cute when he's 8.

22:12.533 --> 22:15.066
When he's 14, you're not gonna like it.

22:15.133 --> 22:17.066
-I know it.
-[laughter]

22:17.133 --> 22:20.900
And I'm sorry, Your Honor. It's just like
a lot of emotion through this whole thing.

22:20.967 --> 22:22.367
I got it.
