00:05.886 --> 00:07.298
Now remember, campers,

00:07.298 --> 00:10.551
both occupants of the vessel
must row as one.

00:10.551 --> 00:12.633
Or you won't end up
going anywhere.

00:12.633 --> 00:14.265
I'm no expert,

00:14.265 --> 00:16.267
but I think the reason
we're not going anywhere

00:16.267 --> 00:17.558
is because we're
not in the water.

00:19.100 --> 00:20.441
Our only chance
of drowning

00:20.441 --> 00:23.484
is if that
sprinkler head goes off.

00:23.484 --> 00:25.276
Yeah, where's the danger?

00:25.276 --> 00:27.358
If we capsize here,
the worst thing
that can happen

00:27.358 --> 00:30.411
would be grass stains.

00:30.411 --> 00:32.413

on the wrong garment

I got a week off
from summer school,

02:29.480 --> 02:31.732
so Mom and Dad said I could
come to Camp Kikiwaka.

let you take the helicopter.

Yeah... "Let me."

to meet one of my campers,

Hey, man, that was so cool,
dropping in on that ladder.

02:44.625 --> 02:48.289
Thanks. I once tried doing
that from our private jet.

02:48.289 --> 02:49.460

on our agenda,

we are going to review
the safe way to open

Look, Lou put us
in charge of safety week,

03:14.365 --> 03:16.026
and I don't wanna
disappoint her.

03:16.026 --> 03:18.409
She always gives me
those sad cow eyes.

03:18.409 --> 03:19.910
She keeps them in a jar.

03:21.452 --> 03:23.324
Whoa! That's weird.

03:23.324 --> 03:24.535
She should keep them
in a bag.

03:26.537 --> 03:28.459
And, Emma, you're
starting to sound
just like Ravi,

03:28.459 --> 03:29.540

your voice is deeper.

you and I

03:38.549 --> 03:40.050
get to put together
the camp yearbook.

03:40.050 --> 03:41.722
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.684
Ooh, look. Remember
the guys versus girls
tetherball game?

03:43.684 --> 03:45.556
That was so fun.

03:45.556 --> 03:47.688
Not for everyone.
Remember how much
you hated losing?

03:49.810 --> 03:52.653
Hey, he shouldn't have called
a double-touchie on me.

03:53.854 --> 03:56.567
Well, he learned
that lesson.

03:56.567 --> 03:57.948
This is gonna be
so much better

03:57.948 --> 03:59.570
than when Hazel
did it last year,

03:59.570 --> 04:01.412
the whole thing
was just pictures of her.

04:01.412 --> 04:04.955
Thirty different
pairs of suspenders,
same creepy smile.

04:06.126 --> 04:07.868
But this year,
she won't be buttin' in.

04:07.868 --> 04:09.790
I told her we were
meeting at The Spot.

04:09.790 --> 04:11.632
Why The Spot?

04:11.632 --> 04:13.924
Because Camp Champion had
their paintball tournament
there today.

04:16.086 --> 04:17.217
Very funny, Lou.

04:18.639 --> 04:21.512
Fun fact. A paintball
can fit up your nose.

04:30.981 --> 04:32.603
So, let's have
some fun!

04:32.603 --> 04:34.234
I need to work off this...

04:35.446 --> 04:37.988
Oatmeal?

04:37.988 --> 04:40.401
Who knows?
I'm just hoping
those are raisins.

04:42.663 --> 04:44.455
Fun would be a nice change.

04:44.455 --> 04:45.996
To avoid injuries,

04:45.996 --> 04:48.829
Ravi and Emma
made us play dodgeball
with bubbles,

04:48.829 --> 04:50.541
while wearing goggles.

04:50.541 --> 04:55.005
BOTH: Because
soap stings your eyes.

04:55.005 --> 04:57.548
Don't worry,
Luke's here.

04:57.548 --> 05:01.632
And we're gonna have
some goggle-free fun.

05:01.632 --> 05:03.514
Hey, watch this, everybody.

05:03.514 --> 05:05.686
My mom calls this one...

05:05.686 --> 05:08.389
"You're grounded."

05:08.389 --> 05:11.522
Who is ready
for another game
of dodge-bubble?

05:11.522 --> 05:13.524
Luke, what
are you doing?

05:13.524 --> 05:14.645
The food here is
dangerous enough

05:14.645 --> 05:15.776
without you
climbing the furniture.

05:16.607 --> 05:18.068
Get down!

Luke, please set a good
example for the campers,

05:30.411 --> 05:32.583
and try
not to be so... You.

05:33.914 --> 05:36.587
Yes. That was
extremely dangerous!

05:36.587 --> 05:38.008
What were you thinking?

05:38.008 --> 05:40.381
I wasn't. That's
what made it fun.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.385
Zuri, your brother
is so cool!

05:44.385 --> 05:46.226
Yeah, I'm one for two.

Look, here's
a great picture
for the yearbook.

05:53.524 --> 05:56.236
Hazel, we never took
a hot air balloon ride
together.

05:56.236 --> 05:57.648
Just because
you were unconscious,

05:57.648 --> 05:59.069
doesn't mean
it didn't happen.

06:01.241 --> 06:02.533
Hey, look!

our first summer
at Camp Kikiwaka

Rookie mistake with
that s'more, Xander.

06:14.795 --> 06:17.167
You left
the 'mallow in too long.

between gooey goodness,
and a mouthful of lava.

Here, try this.
Thanks, Lou.

Wow, finally
something at this camp
that tastes like food.

06:31.432 --> 06:33.353
Hazel, you have
marshmallow goo
right there.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.979
One day, he'll be mine.

06:43.193 --> 06:44.445
You couldn't even
finish a s'more

06:44.445 --> 06:46.907
before you started
creeping on Xander.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.329
Hey, he made
the first move.

06:49.329 --> 06:50.581
No, I didn't!

06:50.581 --> 06:52.583
I was eight.
I didn't have any moves!

Hey, Ravi, what's more fun
than climbing a rock wall?

06:59.880 --> 07:02.382
I know, Emma.
Climbing said wall...

BOTH: Safely.

I can't believe
we're about to climb
a plastic wall,

07:07.508 --> 07:10.100
when there's
a real mountain
right over there.

07:10.100 --> 07:11.852
My typing class
is more dangerous
than this.

07:11.852 --> 07:16.146
Wrist cramps
are nothing to sneeze at.

07:16.146 --> 07:18.819
Hey, you might want
to get the nurse.

07:18.819 --> 07:20.110

that no harm will come to me.

bubbles or goggles, I'm in.

butt clouds.

So how'd you get rid
of Hazel this time?

08:39.399 --> 08:40.771
I told her you went
out into the forest

08:40.771 --> 08:42.482
to chop some wood,
shirtless.

08:42.482 --> 08:45.235
She'll be
looking for you all day.

08:45.235 --> 08:46.777
Why would I be
chopping wood
shirtless?

08:46.777 --> 08:48.278
I don't know.
You're the one
doing it.

08:50.821 --> 08:51.702
Aw, look.

under your Crying Tree.

I did not have
a crying tree.

08:56.747 --> 09:02.042
Come on, it's okay to admit
you were a little homesick.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.925
Okay, so maybe I was
a little homesick,
but I remember

09:04.925 --> 09:06.927
you weren't
that thrilled either
with camp at first.

09:06.927 --> 09:09.800
Only because Hazel was
the world's worst bunk mate.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.632

my toothbrush...

09:12.512 --> 09:14.635

That Hazel's
got me madder

09:24.274 --> 09:25.856
than a bull that sat
on a bee's nest.

09:25.856 --> 09:27.067
Ugh!

09:27.067 --> 09:29.690
Hey, don't kick my tree.

09:29.690 --> 09:32.693
Sorry. It's just that dang
Hazel is a poopy head!

09:32.693 --> 09:33.904
Language!

09:35.365 --> 09:36.366
Sorry.

09:37.748 --> 09:40.290
Hey, are you crying?

09:40.290 --> 09:42.623
No, I just have
something in my eye.

09:43.834 --> 09:45.626
Is it sadness?

09:45.626 --> 09:46.707
(SNIFFLES)

09:46.707 --> 09:48.919
Maybe.

09:48.919 --> 09:50.380
Would you like
some company?

09:51.301 --> 09:52.472
Sure.

09:56.516 --> 10:01.351
Ugh! I think something
took a tinkle right here.

10:01.351 --> 10:04.564
That's my crying puddle.
I have enormous tear ducts.

10:11.571 --> 10:12.863
That was the moment
I realized

10:12.863 --> 10:14.534
that I had finally found
a friend at camp.

10:14.534 --> 10:16.867
Me, too. Despite
your tear duct issue.

10:18.288 --> 10:20.040
But nothing
meant more to me
than when you left

10:20.040 --> 10:21.872
that toy guitar
under my Crying Tree
the next day.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.004
Uh...

10:24.004 --> 10:25.956
I didn't
leave a toy guitar
under your tree.

10:25.956 --> 10:26.877
You didn't?

10:26.877 --> 10:28.799
No, but I did leave you
some eye drops.

10:28.799 --> 10:31.672
You were crying so much,
people thought you had
pinkeye.

10:36.967 --> 10:39.099
(CHUCKLES) This is
going to be way better

10:39.099 --> 10:42.182
than climbing a boring wall
covered in Ravi's sweat.

10:42.182 --> 10:43.854
Oh, yeah.

10:43.854 --> 10:46.687
Although I did like
watching Ravi swinging
from that rope

10:46.687 --> 10:49.109
like a nerdy pinata.
(CHUCKLES)

10:49.109 --> 10:50.650
Except, if you whacked Ravi,

10:50.650 --> 10:52.532
the only thing that would
fall out is calculators.

10:53.734 --> 10:54.905
And safety manuals.

10:56.276 --> 10:57.948
Okay, follow me.

11:00.200 --> 11:02.202
Uh, Luke,
the sign says

11:02.202 --> 11:04.044
that way is dangerous.

11:04.044 --> 11:07.377
You see "danger,"
I see "fun!"

11:07.377 --> 11:10.460
Two years of summer school
and you still can't read.

11:21.932 --> 11:23.764
Wait a minute.

11:23.764 --> 11:25.976
I just remembered.
I thanked you for
the toy guitar.

11:25.976 --> 11:26.977
You did?

11:29.860 --> 11:32.983
Hey, Lou, thank you
very much for...

11:32.983 --> 11:35.195
You know,
what you gave me.

11:35.195 --> 11:38.078
Oh! You're welcome.
It was no big deal.

11:38.078 --> 11:39.449
It was to me.

11:47.878 --> 11:49.499
I remember that.

11:49.499 --> 11:51.922
Why didn't
you mention the guitar,
or your Crying Tree?

11:51.922 --> 11:54.885
Eh, there were
too many people around.
I was embarrassed.

11:54.885 --> 11:57.137
But why did you say
"You're welcome"

11:57.137 --> 11:58.929
if you didn't give me
the toy guitar?

11:58.929 --> 12:01.972
I just thought you were
thanking me for sharing
my potato tots.

12:04.144 --> 12:06.807
Why would I
thank you for that?
That's no big deal!

12:06.807 --> 12:09.519
Which is why
I said it was
"No big deal!"

12:10.310 --> 12:11.611
Oh.

12:11.611 --> 12:12.943
Holy haystack,

12:12.943 --> 12:15.155
I just remembered
something that happened
right after you left.

12:16.907 --> 12:19.569
See you later, Lou.
Bye!

12:19.569 --> 12:22.953
Hey, what were you
and Dreamy McHandsome
talking about?

12:22.953 --> 12:24.785
Oh, he was
just thanking me

12:24.785 --> 12:27.037
for giving him
some of my potato tots.

12:27.037 --> 12:29.920
Oh, I gave him
something, too.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.962
I guess
he didn't like it.

12:34.254 --> 12:38.178
By the way, I've been
using your pillow case
for my dirty laundry.

12:38.178 --> 12:39.759
Ha-ha!

12:43.053 --> 12:44.845
Well, that explains
my athlete's ear.

12:46.937 --> 12:49.099
So Hazel gave you
the guitar?

12:49.099 --> 12:53.443
Wow! I can't believe
she did something so nice,

12:53.443 --> 12:55.655
and that you didn't
give me anything!

12:55.655 --> 12:57.027
I would like
to point out

12:57.027 --> 13:00.070
that I gave you the gift
of crunchy potato nuggets!

13:03.904 --> 13:06.206
They must be around
here somewhere.

13:07.497 --> 13:09.789
Uh-oh.
Look at that.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.121
RAVI: Oh, no.

13:11.121 --> 13:14.044
Even Luke would not
take them on that trail.

13:14.044 --> 13:15.255
I know,
that would be stupid.

13:15.255 --> 13:16.586
Idiotic.
Stupid.

13:16.586 --> 13:18.008
Ludicrous.
Stupid.

13:18.008 --> 13:19.419
They went that way.

13:19.970 --> 13:20.971
Yup.

13:21.551 --> 13:22.632
Oh!

13:22.632 --> 13:23.803
And when we get back,

13:23.803 --> 13:25.846
we shall work
on expanding
your vocabulary.

13:25.846 --> 13:26.847
Don't be stupid.

13:29.689 --> 13:31.231
(CHUCKLING)

13:31.231 --> 13:32.812
Zuri, check it out!

13:32.812 --> 13:35.485
It's looks
just like the view
from our penthouse.

13:35.485 --> 13:38.438
Except, without
all the buildings,
people and trash.

13:41.071 --> 13:42.652
(ZURI SHUDDERING)

13:42.652 --> 13:45.365
(EXCLAIMS)
Can we please go
back down now?

13:47.407 --> 13:50.080
Hey, I can see camp!

13:50.080 --> 13:51.912
Yikes, Gladys
is sunbathing.

13:52.662 --> 13:54.794
Don't look at the dock!

13:55.835 --> 13:56.836
(STRAINING)

13:58.838 --> 14:00.550
Zuri, are you okay?

14:00.550 --> 14:03.173
Well, my muscles
are burning,

14:03.173 --> 14:04.965
there's dirt
falling into my face,

14:04.965 --> 14:07.767
and I'm pretty sure
a millipede just crawled
into my shirt.

14:09.059 --> 14:10.100
So you're good.

14:13.183 --> 14:16.186
This is awesome!
Hey, I can see your camp.

14:17.647 --> 14:21.071
Whoa! Who's the hairy dude
sunbathing on the dock?

14:23.483 --> 14:25.405
(GASPS) I'm slipping!

14:25.405 --> 14:26.536
(SCREAMING)
Zuri!

14:26.536 --> 14:28.038
(SCREAMING)
(GASPS)

14:30.250 --> 14:32.492
Zuri! Griff!
Are you okay?

14:32.492 --> 14:34.164
I'm going with no!

14:39.089 --> 14:40.340
ZURI: Help! Luke!

14:40.340 --> 14:43.463
Okay, I'm coming down
to get you! Don't move!

14:43.463 --> 14:45.175
Where would we go?

14:45.175 --> 14:47.137
I mean,
besides the afterlife!

14:49.179 --> 14:50.140
Almost there!

14:51.851 --> 14:53.934
Oh, no! (SCREAMING)

15:01.231 --> 15:02.572
Zuri!

15:03.403 --> 15:04.404
(GASPING)

15:07.287 --> 15:09.199
I told you guys
this was gonna be fun.

15:11.952 --> 15:13.083
What do we do now?

15:13.083 --> 15:14.454
I say
we scream for help.

15:14.454 --> 15:15.535
I like it!

15:15.535 --> 15:17.167
Help!
Save us!

15:17.167 --> 15:18.458
We're up here!

15:18.458 --> 15:19.960
(RUBBLE FALLING)

15:20.250 --> 15:21.501
(GRUNTS)

15:23.463 --> 15:25.255
Maybe we shouldn't
scream so loud.

15:25.255 --> 15:27.137
Help.
Save us.

15:27.137 --> 15:28.138
We're up here.

15:32.222 --> 15:34.724
Hey, Hazel,
you got a minute?

15:34.724 --> 15:36.016
Oh, my gosh!

15:36.016 --> 15:39.189
You're proposing!
Yes, yes, 1,000 times, yes!

15:41.191 --> 15:44.564
Sorry, I'm not proposing.
But I am here to thank you.

15:44.564 --> 15:47.447
Thank me? For what?
Is this a trick?

15:47.447 --> 15:51.621
No! No, I wanted
to talk to you
about this.

15:51.621 --> 15:54.534
I realize now that
you were the one who
left this guitar for me.

15:54.534 --> 15:55.875
And if it's
not too late,

15:55.875 --> 15:57.537
I just wanted
to say thank you.

15:57.537 --> 16:01.211
Oh, you're welcome. I can't
believe you still have that.

16:01.211 --> 16:04.004
Of course. If it weren't
for your kindness back then,

16:04.004 --> 16:05.295
I might have left camp.

16:05.295 --> 16:08.348
Instead, I stayed,
and found my love for music.

16:08.348 --> 16:10.010
And I owe all that to you.

16:10.010 --> 16:12.182
But why didn't you
thank me then?

16:12.182 --> 16:14.354
That really
hurt my feelings.

16:14.354 --> 16:15.975
I didn't know
it was from you!

16:15.975 --> 16:17.227
I left you a note.

16:17.227 --> 16:19.059
You did?
I never saw it.

16:34.574 --> 16:36.286
(SNIFFLING)

16:51.221 --> 16:53.513
Oh, my gosh,
I bet I know
what happened.

16:57.397 --> 16:59.349
I always thought
that was the receipt!

16:59.349 --> 17:00.270
(SIGHS)

17:00.270 --> 17:01.851
I should've
taped it on.

17:03.693 --> 17:06.646
"Dear Xandy,
I hope this makes you happy.

17:08.278 --> 17:10.070
"Love, Hazel."

17:12.031 --> 17:15.455
I am so sorry
I misjudged you
all these years.

17:15.455 --> 17:16.996
Can we start over
and be friends?

17:17.827 --> 17:19.289
I would like that.

17:27.717 --> 17:30.760
(CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY)
Hazel, moment's over.

17:32.632 --> 17:35.515
You owe me this,
Dreamy McHandsome!

17:42.232 --> 17:45.145
I cannot believe
they are not up here.

17:45.145 --> 17:46.446
We couldn't
have passed them
on the trail.

17:46.446 --> 17:48.488
ZURI: Save us!
LUKE: Help!

17:48.488 --> 17:52.242
Wait, do you hear someone
whispering for help?

17:53.032 --> 17:54.784
LUKE: Help.

17:54.784 --> 17:57.827
Yes! Luke! Griff!

17:57.827 --> 17:58.908
Zuri!

17:58.908 --> 18:00.540
Hey! We're down here!

18:02.202 --> 18:03.663
(GASPS)

18:03.663 --> 18:06.796
What in the world
are you doing down there?

18:06.796 --> 18:08.418
Country line dancing.

18:08.418 --> 18:09.879
What's it look like
we're doing?

18:09.879 --> 18:11.301
We're hanging on
for dear life!

18:13.213 --> 18:17.016
So let's stop with the Q&A,
and start with the helping!

18:17.016 --> 18:19.389
And hurry up! I have to
go to the bathroom,

18:19.389 --> 18:21.721
and there's not a lot of
privacy on this ledge!

18:22.892 --> 18:24.274
Don't worry,
we'll get you up!

18:24.274 --> 18:26.025
Did you bring the rope?

18:26.025 --> 18:29.819
Water. Water. Water...

18:31.070 --> 18:32.322
Water.

18:34.194 --> 18:36.075
Please tell me you brought
more than just drinks.

18:36.075 --> 18:38.948
Never dismiss the importance
of proper hydration.

18:39.289 --> 18:41.000
Rope!

18:41.000 --> 18:43.413
Okay, listen! We'll
throw the rope down.

18:43.413 --> 18:45.835
Tie it around your waist,
like the safety harness
we showed you,

18:45.835 --> 18:47.457
and then we'll
help you climb up!

18:48.548 --> 18:50.170
I'll help you climb up.

18:50.170 --> 18:51.381
Oh!

18:51.381 --> 18:52.752
Catch the rope!

18:52.752 --> 18:53.883
(GASPS)

18:58.017 --> 18:59.969
I think
she missed a step.

19:01.851 --> 19:03.893
Please tell me
you brought...
Yes, I brought a back-up rope.

19:03.893 --> 19:05.765
Okay.
Obvi.

19:07.727 --> 19:10.320
Okay, I will tie
one end to the tree.

19:16.115 --> 19:18.278
Okay, Zuri, you first.

19:18.278 --> 19:20.410
That's the smartest thing
you've said all day!

19:34.384 --> 19:36.216
Oh, you made it!

19:36.216 --> 19:37.347
Thanks, Ravi.

19:37.347 --> 19:39.349
I guess I have
two cool brothers
after all.

19:39.349 --> 19:41.060
You're safe!

19:41.060 --> 19:43.142
Scare me like that again,
and I'll wring your neck.

19:43.142 --> 19:44.644
I love you so much!

19:44.644 --> 19:46.686
Kinda getting
mixed messages here.

19:47.607 --> 19:49.359
Hello?

19:49.359 --> 19:52.272
Can we save
everyone's life
before we celebrate?

19:56.276 --> 19:57.817
Okay, Luke,
you're next.

19:59.409 --> 20:00.410
Whoa! (GASPING)

20:01.871 --> 20:04.584
My life just flashed
before my eyes!

20:05.665 --> 20:07.377
Ravi, I owe you
an apology.

20:09.539 --> 20:11.461
You also owe me $40,

20:11.461 --> 20:14.254
so please grab the rope
and climb to safety!

20:18.968 --> 20:21.220
EMMA: Pull! Pull!
Almost there.

20:25.515 --> 20:26.516

20:28.227 --> 20:29.899
Luke!

20:34.564 --> 20:35.695
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

20:35.695 --> 20:37.196
I have got you,
brother!

20:37.196 --> 20:38.738

20:40.950 --> 20:42.492
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

20:44.073 --> 20:45.575
Luke, are you okay?

20:45.575 --> 20:48.868
Yeah... Thanks to you guys.

20:48.868 --> 20:50.460
Good thing
you brought that rope.

20:50.460 --> 20:53.252
Rule one of safety,
always be prepared.

20:53.252 --> 20:57.877
Rule number two,
never go anywhere
with Luke.

20:57.877 --> 21:01.431
Okay, I realize now,
I probably should've
been better prepared

21:01.431 --> 21:04.474
before I led us down
the chained-off trail
that said "Danger."

21:04.474 --> 21:06.806
Or you could just not go down
the dangerous trail at all.

21:06.806 --> 21:08.308
(SCOFFS)

21:08.308 --> 21:09.649
Why don't I just
lock myself in a library

21:09.649 --> 21:12.482
and call myself Ravi?

21:12.482 --> 21:14.944
I am so glad
I got rope burns
saving your life.

21:16.446 --> 21:17.947
Thank you, Ravi.

21:17.947 --> 21:21.491
And, Zuri, Griff,
sorry about the whole

21:21.491 --> 21:24.784
"nearly getting
you killed" thing.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.577
I can't believe we almost
fell off a mountain.

21:27.577 --> 21:30.289
Which was so cool!
Yeah!

21:30.289 --> 21:33.463
Speaking of cool,
who wants to hydrate?

21:33.463 --> 21:34.624
Me.
Please.

21:34.624 --> 21:35.545
Oh, yeah.

21:35.545 --> 21:38.418
Told you. I also got
lotion for chafing.

21:40.380 --> 21:42.261
No? Just me, then.

21:45.885 --> 21:47.347
We'll really
miss you, Luke.

21:47.347 --> 21:49.349
Try not to kill anyone
at summer school.

21:49.349 --> 21:51.601
I start
chemistry on Monday,
so no promises.

21:59.699 --> 22:01.991
Have you ever thought
of taking a bus?

22:01.991 --> 22:03.443
You know I get carsick.

22:05.615 --> 22:06.536
Well, thanks for
everything, guys.

22:06.536 --> 22:09.579
Oh! Wait, Luke,
you should put on
a helmet.

22:09.579 --> 22:13.162
Oh, okay. Bye!

22:13.162 --> 22:14.544
Wait, no!

22:15.294 --> 22:16.376
RAVI: Wait!

22:16.376 --> 22:17.717
Ravi, let go!

22:17.717 --> 22:19.459
There's only enough food
for one on this flight.

22:19.459 --> 22:21.461
I would love to,
but I am entangled!

to my...

(WATER SPLASHES)

22:31.971 --> 22:34.734
Huh, Ravi landed
in the lake.
That was lucky.

22:34.734 --> 22:36.776
(RAVI SCREAMING)

22:36.776 --> 22:39.439

woke him right up.
