02:43.927 --> 02:46.527
What you gotta do is beg for little mercy.

02:46.527 --> 02:50.827
Begging you would be like
swallowing penis for eternity!

02:53.027 --> 02:55.527
Come on, give it up!

02:55.827 --> 02:57.827
Got it.

03:01.027 --> 03:02.927
Come on, Eddie!

03:07.027 --> 03:09.927
You're gonna need a priest.

03:11.727 --> 03:16.727
And when your mommy's crying at the funeral
I'm gonna goose her with a turkey neck!

03:17.727 --> 03:19.927
Yeah, baby...

03:33.327 --> 03:35.927
Oh, shit!

03:36.527 --> 03:39.027
Oh, hey is that the best you can do?

03:39.027 --> 03:41.427
You better phone for help.

03:45.327 --> 03:46.327
Get him, Eddie!

03:46.827 --> 03:48.827
Come on Eddie, hit him.

03:48.927 --> 03:50.627
Hurt him real bad.

03:50.627 --> 03:53.827
Scumbag, faggot.

03:53.827 --> 03:56.627
Stop it Eddie!
Leave something for the garbage man.

03:56.627 --> 04:01.627
I hate that cheap punk. What da fuck
he thinks he's coming from?

04:03.127 --> 04:06.527
You ripped him real bad this time, Eddie.

04:06.527 --> 04:07.427
Nothing left of him.

04:07.427 --> 04:12.427
It's the third time.
You'd think the son of a bitch would
have learned by now to stop trying me.

04:12.627 --> 04:16.527
Oh, wow, You're a genuine man.

04:16.527 --> 04:20.327
Come on, Eddie. Lemme buy you a drink!

04:20.327 --> 04:25.327
Come on!

04:33.127 --> 04:36.827
Hey, we ca-can't just leave
him laying out there.

04:36.827 --> 04:38.827
He might be dying out there.

04:38.827 --> 04:43.827
He hates help. Piss on you, if he could.
Fuck him.

04:59.027 --> 05:02.027
That guy's been gone for some time.

05:01.027 --> 05:05.227
He was K.O.-ed last night.
He might be a few steps slow.
He'll be back.

05:05.227 --> 05:07.027
I am starving.

05:07.027 --> 05:12.027
You want me to close the place?
I say he's ok.

05:12.427 --> 05:17.427
What's ok about him?
He's like a wet rat in the rain.

05:18.227 --> 05:20.627
Rat without any teeth.

05:20.627 --> 05:24.727
Red hell. He refuses to join their outrage.
He drinks and he waits.

05:24.727 --> 05:29.027
I hope he doesn't wait for that
sandwich to deliver itself.

05:29.027 --> 05:33.527
Now look! 20 bucks for that kind
of head is outrageous.

05:33.527 --> 05:37.527
I did you good, old fart.
I did you good.

05:37.527 --> 05:39.627
I picked your champaigne cork off.

05:39.627 --> 05:41.527
I'm giving you 15 bucks.

05:41.527 --> 05:43.427
20 bucks!

05:43.427 --> 05:47.127
Nobody in this neighbourhood can
swallow paste like I can.

05:47.127 --> 05:52.127
Oh, shit.

06:11.827 --> 06:16.827
Oh, beautiful. Uhuu.

06:23.527 --> 06:25.327
Look what the cat dragged in...

06:25.327 --> 06:28.527
Good to see ya Henry.

06:28.527 --> 06:30.727
Yeah, good to see you walk in here.

06:30.727 --> 06:37.427
Hey, all of a sudden I'm so popular.
Maybe I gotta run for city council.

06:41.027 --> 06:42.627
Aah, keep the change.

06:42.627 --> 06:43.627
All of it?

06:43.627 --> 06:48.627
Yeah, go ahead have all.

06:52.627 --> 06:54.227
What do you drink?

06:54.227 --> 06:56.327
Almost everything.

06:56.327 --> 07:01.327
Give him a scotch and water.

07:01.527 --> 07:04.127
Who the hell invented the sandwich?

07:04.127 --> 07:06.127
They ought to write a book about him.

07:06.127 --> 07:08.827
Henry, you've got to stop fighting Eddie.

07:08.827 --> 07:11.427
<? You have no ?> reason, that's
why you lose every fight.

07:11.427 --> 07:16.427
I can whip him without a reason,
because I've got the guts.

07:16.427 --> 07:21.127
Hey, I've got the guts.

07:21.127 --> 07:26.127
But the guts need fuel.

07:33.627 --> 07:35.027
Eeh, what the hell?

07:35.027 --> 07:38.827
Hmm, ham.
It's ham with mustard and radish.

07:38.827 --> 07:40.627
He's a goddamn rat-thief.

07:40.627 --> 07:41.627
That wasn't right

07:41.627 --> 07:44.527
I've oughtta cream you good!

07:44.527 --> 07:47.427
All I need is a litte fuel,
that's all I need to be better.

07:47.427 --> 07:51.027
You're outta line there, Henry!
You just can't swoop down on a
man's food like that.

07:51.027 --> 07:53.127
He's like a goddamned seagull!!

07:53.127 --> 07:58.127
Here's for the drinks.
We can't eat in here, it's disgusting.

08:00.427 --> 08:04.027
Have a nice day guys. hahaha.

08:04.027 --> 08:08.327
Henry, you want to go to your room
and lay down for a few hours.

08:08.327 --> 08:11.127
Frankly, I'm sick of looking of your face.

08:11.127 --> 08:16.127
Have a drink Jim.
Come on, on the cuff, one on the house.

08:19.827 --> 08:24.827
I think the last time you've ever
paid for a drink is the first time.

08:30.027 --> 08:32.126
Jim.

08:32.126 --> 08:38.027
- See you tonight, over here?
- See you tonight.

08:56.827 --> 09:01.827
I don't see what you see in that guy.

09:03.527 --> 09:08.527
He's as right as any of us.

09:26.827 --> 09:35.027
I've got to have the money tomorrow morning
by 9 o'clock or I'll be thrown out of my room
and you're gonna be in trouble and I'm gonna be in trouble.

09:35.027 --> 09:40.027
And we're both gonna be in trouble.
You understand that?

09:56.627 --> 09:59.827
Fuel.

10:20.727 --> 10:27.527
Some people never go crazy.
What truly horrible lifes they must live.

10:47.527 --> 10:51.227
You're listening to the Southern California
Gas Company afternoon concert.

10:51.227 --> 10:55.227
We've just heard the Poem of Ecstasy
by Alexander Scriabin.

10:55.227 --> 11:00.227
We continue now with the music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
His Disuldante Jubilante.

11:58.427 --> 12:03.427
oh, shit.

12:08.527 --> 12:11.927
ohh, shit.

12:11.927 --> 12:16.927
come on.

13:45.027 --> 13:50.027
Young man like you, drunk every day at noon.
Get yourself a job!

13:51.327 --> 13:53.427
- I have one.
- Oh, Really?

13:53.427 --> 13:58.427
Yeah, killing the cockroaches
in that place of yours.

13:59.827 --> 14:04.827
Son of a bitch. Kiss my tuck ass.

14:17.827 --> 14:20.327
Hey.

14:20.327 --> 14:23.927
What's new?

14:23.927 --> 14:28.927
Grandma Mo is in the back with Jack.
That's what's new.

14:32.727 --> 14:36.627
Hey boy! Fetch me a draft.

14:36.627 --> 14:40.527
Some guys really know how to get the women.

14:40.527 --> 14:43.127
You don't know how?

14:43.127 --> 14:49.527
Eh, I can get one for ten minutes.
That's my limit.

14:49.927 --> 14:52.327
Hey.

14:52.327 --> 14:57.327
How come you're so fucked up?

14:57.927 --> 15:02.327
Hey you! You with the filthy apron.

15:02.327 --> 15:04.627
Be back in seconds.

15:04.627 --> 15:09.627
I hear a voice down there,
but sure as hell don't see much.

15:09.827 --> 15:14.827
Seems like that beatin' I gave you last
night must have rattled your bells, huh?

15:15.127 --> 15:20.127
I remember ordering a draft, barkeep.
What, are you outta brew, or is that
lobotomy finally takin' hold?

15:24.527 --> 15:28.827
I'm gonna drive your head through that
fuckin' wall tonight, you faggot.

15:28.827 --> 15:33.827
I pulled my punches on you last night, but no more.

15:36.627 --> 15:41.627
Yeah, it's definitely him, all right.
So what you wanna do?

15:42.027 --> 15:49.027
Well, I'm not sure that you wanna come down here right now.

16:04.427 --> 16:06.027
What the fuck do you want tonight?!

16:06.027 --> 16:11.027
You're lookin' at a new man, my boy.
I've got a full tank of fuel.

16:12.627 --> 16:17.627
You've got to pay for that goddamned beer.

16:20.327 --> 16:24.927
Eddie, come close, I want to tell you something.

16:24.927 --> 16:29.927
- Come here, I want you to hear it good.
- Hear what?

16:31.627 --> 16:35.327
Your mother's cunt stinks like carpet cleaner.

16:35.327 --> 16:40.327
That's it, fuck! Come on!

16:45.327 --> 16:50.327
Fuck you!!

17:04.627 --> 17:09.627
I've seen enough of these fights.

17:11.027 --> 17:15.227
My god, there's nothin' left of it.
She's like a vacuum cleaner.

17:15.227 --> 17:17.027
20 bucks, Jack.

17:17.027 --> 17:22.027
All right, I'm giving 3 to 1 odds.
I'll have this fag lickin'
my balls inside of 5 minutes.

17:22.627 --> 17:25.327
You want? How about you?

17:25.327 --> 17:30.327
How 'bout you?

17:31.027 --> 17:34.027
- How about you?
- Yeah, I'll take 10 bucks for that.

17:34.027 --> 17:34.927
You're on.

17:34.927 --> 17:38.627
Hey Jim, maybe I can't.

17:38.627 --> 17:45.327
Your life is just a points of can'ts.
You can't work, you can't fuck and you can't fight.

17:45.327 --> 17:49.527
- I'm still putting up ten in taken 3 to 1.
- You're on it.

17:49.527 --> 17:51.027
- You cover for Eddie?
- Absolutely.

17:51.027 --> 17:56.027
I'd like to get ahold of your ten.

18:04.727 --> 18:09.727
I'd hate to be you if I we're me.

18:18.627 --> 18:23.627
What holds you up, motherfucker?
You usually fall by now.

18:44.527 --> 18:49.527
- OK, Eddie.
- What's ok, you fucking romie. What's ok?

20:27.027 --> 20:30.027
- You've got him?
- Got him.

20:30.727 --> 20:35.727
Oh, man.

20:38.827 --> 20:43.827
Ten, twenty,...

20:46.027 --> 20:50.927
Oh, Eddie. Eddie, what that bastard did you?

20:50.927 --> 20:54.727
Fucking almost killed me.

20:54.727 --> 20:59.727
Hey, man. Give me a draft.

21:00.927 --> 21:03.027
No, no.

21:04.027 --> 21:09.027
I'm sorry man, I can't serve you.

21:29.527 --> 21:34.327
Yo, Henry.

21:34.327 --> 21:39.327
Look Henry, take this. Eddie wailed through
his blood, but he paid up.

21:40.027 --> 21:44.527
Come on, take it. You've earned your
collar, all I did was watch.

21:44.527 --> 21:49.527
Ey, I can't take the money, Jim.
Suppose I'd lost.

21:50.927 --> 21:55.927
You buy alot of drinks for this, slugger.

21:56.127 --> 22:01.127
As you put it that way, I'll take
a couple of scotch and waters.

22:05.527 --> 22:09.227
You should take some more.

22:09.227 --> 22:14.027
Hey, what do you think I am? A bum?

22:14.027 --> 22:20.527
- Thanks Jim.
- You've been not eating anything for a while.
It might turn to something dangerous.

22:30.927 --> 22:35.927
Hey. Give me a beer.

22:51.627 --> 22:56.627
- Christ, who's that one?
- Who?

22:57.727 --> 23:06.227
That woman. She looks like a kind
of distressed goddess.

23:06.227 --> 23:10.727
- Oh, Wanda
- Wanda?

23:10.727 --> 23:15.527
Hey tell me man. This Wanda she
looks pretty good.

23:15.527 --> 23:19.327
- How come nobody sits next to her?
- She's crazy.

23:19.327 --> 23:23.027
Crazy? Oh.

23:48.727 --> 23:53.627
I can't stand people.

23:53.627 --> 23:58.627
- I hate them.
- Oh, yeah?

23:59.327 --> 24:03.427
You hate them?

24:03.427 --> 24:10.027
No, but I seem to feel better
when they're not around.

24:11.727 --> 24:18.027
Hey barkeep. Two scotch and waters.

24:21.527 --> 24:27.027
May I ask you the same damn think,
people are always asking me?

24:27.027 --> 24:29.927
Like?

24:30.727 --> 24:35.727
Like what do you do?

24:42.527 --> 24:45.227
I drink.

24:50.827 --> 24:54.027
- That's it.
- That's what?

24:54.027 --> 24:59.027
I'm broke. Can't buy another drink.

25:01.227 --> 25:03.627
You mean, you don't have any money?

25:03.627 --> 25:10.627
No money. No job. No rent.
Hey, I'm back to normal.

25:27.827 --> 25:32.827
Come with me.

25:55.027 --> 25:58.227
No, I'll have a couple of packs
of smokes. Merrit's.

25:58.227 --> 26:02.227
- Care for a couple of cigars?
- Yeah.

26:02.227 --> 26:05.227
Couple of good cigars.

26:05.227 --> 26:09.727
And charge it to Rob Revans.

26:09.727 --> 26:14.727
Wanda, I'm gonna have to call Willbur for his ok.

26:15.327 --> 26:20.327
Go ahead.

26:22.227 --> 26:26.727
Willbur. Yeah, Wanda has arrived, she's got some stuff.

26:26.727 --> 26:35.027
Her total is 23.8. Yeah. Bottles of scotch. Sixpack of beer.

26:35.027 --> 26:40.027
How did your face get so beat up?

26:41.127 --> 26:44.627
You don't mind, do you?

26:44.627 --> 26:46.827
I think it looks beautiful.

26:46.827 --> 26:49.727
Hey, you little pricks.

26:49.727 --> 26:52.927
Pardon me, Willbur.

26:52.927 --> 26:55.927
Willbur wants to know if your're coming over.

26:55.927 --> 26:58.427
Yeah, she is.

26:58.427 --> 27:03.427
It's ok wanda.

27:06.227 --> 27:11.227
Grab the stuff and follow me. We'll try my place.

27:11.627 --> 27:14.627
Goddamn it!

27:14.627 --> 27:18.027
My place is next, I'm up on the third floor.

27:18.027 --> 27:21.527
Don't worry, there is an elevator.

27:21.527 --> 27:24.327
I love corn.

27:24.327 --> 27:30.127
- I'm gonna pick some corn.
- Hey wait, you can't go up there,
that's on the open. You'll be seen.

27:30.127 --> 27:34.027
I don't care, I love corn.
I'm gonna pick some corn.

27:34.027 --> 27:39.027
hey. what are you doing?

27:44.227 --> 27:53.227
Hey, you're drunk. Baby, look at those ears,
they're still young. They're green, you
can't eat that stuff.

27:55.027 --> 27:58.427
Who's Wilbur? Is he your pimp?

27:58.427 --> 28:03.427
I'm no hooker, I don't have a pimp.

28:04.827 --> 28:07.527
Who's the guy?

28:07.527 --> 28:12.527
Wilbur? Just an old guy who cares for me.

28:19.027 --> 28:21.727
Oh shit! It's the cops.
Let's go. Which way?

28:21.727 --> 28:26.727
Go. Quick. Head for the basement. There.

28:27.027 --> 28:30.527
Goddamn!

28:30.527 --> 28:33.527
Stop! Police! Stay right where you are.

28:33.527 --> 28:35.027
Here!

28:35.027 --> 28:37.527
- Which way?
- This way.

28:37.527 --> 28:39.727
If the elevator isn't at the bottom,
we're damned.

28:39.727 --> 28:44.727
Stop or we'll fire!

28:50.827 --> 28:52.627
Hit quickly the three button!

28:52.627 --> 28:57.627
Ah, shit! Get this fucking thing stop.

28:58.327 --> 29:03.327
Leave the door open.

29:11.327 --> 29:13.627
<? ?>

29:13.627 --> 29:18.627
- Don't make a sound
- Hey, take your shoes of.

29:37.827 --> 29:46.027
- I really wanna get those fuckers.
- And you see that woman? She really has great legs.

30:12.327 --> 30:17.327
Have they left?

30:17.827 --> 30:21.927
Let's not take a chance.

30:21.927 --> 30:26.927
Let's be quiet for the rest of the night.

30:27.027 --> 30:32.027
They might be camped down there.

30:33.427 --> 30:38.427
I guess you'll have to stay the night.

30:40.927 --> 30:43.627
Don't you hate cops?

30:43.627 --> 30:48.627
No, but I seem to feel better when
they're not around.

30:56.427 --> 31:01.427
I sure want to thank you for
your hospitality.

31:06.127 --> 31:11.127
Just one thing.

31:12.527 --> 31:16.827
I want never fall in love.

31:16.827 --> 31:21.827
I don't wanna go through that. I can't.

31:27.527 --> 31:32.527
Don't worry. Nobody's ever loved me yet.

32:07.527 --> 32:12.527
Oh shit. I told you that stuff is green.
Look at it.

32:31.027 --> 32:36.027
That never works.

32:40.027 --> 32:45.027
<? ?>

32:46.527 --> 32:50.027
Hey stop it. shhh. hey, be quiet.

32:50.027 --> 32:54.927
The cops might be still out there.

32:54.927 --> 32:59.927
Nothing ever works allright in this life.

33:00.027 --> 33:09.027
It's allright.

34:38.027 --> 34:44.027
- Hey, what the hell was that?
- Same old thing, only it's a
little better than TV.

34:45.027 --> 34:49.427
There you go lover.

34:49.427 --> 34:54.427
- Lover?
- Don't you remember?

34:56.527 --> 34:59.027
Aah, but what's this?

34:59.027 --> 35:01.227
<? ?>key.

35:01.227 --> 35:05.527
<? ?>better than one.

35:05.527 --> 35:08.027
<? ?> thing

35:08.027 --> 35:12.527
Yeah?
What you're good at?

35:12.527 --> 35:17.527
Juicy. (phone rings)

35:22.827 --> 35:25.427
Yeah? Oh.

35:25.427 --> 35:31.027
Wilbur. I.. geez. I couldn't make
it over last night.

35:31.027 --> 35:35.227
I got <? ?>. I went to bed.

35:35.227 --> 35:37.727
Tonight?

35:37.727 --> 35:41.827
Well, geez, I don't know. Uhm.

35:41.827 --> 35:46.327
Let me think about it.

35:46.327 --> 35:49.327
Helloo. Yeah.

35:49.327 --> 35:51.827
Hey Willbur, how're you doing?

35:51.827 --> 35:56.827
Hey, listen Willbur, you'll call here again,
I'm gonna come over.
I'm gonna do a tapdance on your skull.

35:57.627 --> 36:07.427
Listen, Willbur be very carefull. Yeah,
he's a very jealous man, he's a wrestler.
He drinks beer, sits around all day, farts, lifts weights.

36:07.427 --> 36:10.027
He hung up.

36:14.527 --> 36:19.527
Aaaaah. We really cut off a good source of
supply there, Mr. von Builderass

36:21.627 --> 36:24.827
von Builderass? What's that?

36:24.827 --> 36:29.827
It's the way you walk across the room, when you act.

36:30.327 --> 36:33.927
Yeah, you're the damndest barfly I've ever seen.

36:33.927 --> 36:38.927
You act like some real blue blood, a royalty.

36:41.727 --> 36:46.727
I wasn't aware of that. Thank you.

36:46.727 --> 36:51.727
- Noticed, that you're class too, baby.
- All right.

36:54.527 --> 36:58.827
I gotta tell you something.

36:58.827 --> 37:07.027
If a man came by with a fifth of whiskey,
I'm afraid I'd go with him.

37:12.227 --> 37:17.227
I could get a lot of booze out of Willbur.
I'm giving up too much.

37:17.727 --> 37:22.727
- I don't know about the next.
- Hey, I'm the next.

37:23.327 --> 37:28.227
- I'll suply the booze.
- How?

37:28.227 --> 37:30.727
I'll get a job.

37:30.727 --> 37:35.727
(laughter)

37:36.727 --> 37:39.327
What happened to you along the way?

37:39.327 --> 37:41.527
You're weird.

37:41.527 --> 37:49.527
By the way. The first thing I noticed
about you, were your legs.

37:49.927 --> 37:54.927
Really?

37:54.927 --> 37:58.527
I guess I got lucky with legs.

37:58.527 --> 38:03.527
It's the brain I was shorter though.

38:09.927 --> 38:13.327
Oh, yeah. Hey.

38:13.327 --> 38:18.327
I could look at a woman's legs for hours.

38:20.327 --> 38:24.827
I've got nothin', but time.

38:24.827 --> 38:29.527
- <? ?>crazy.
- That's crazy.

38:29.527 --> 38:32.327
I dunno.

38:32.327 --> 38:35.527
We're all in some kind of hell.

38:35.527 --> 38:40.527
And the madhouse is the only place,
where people know they're in hell.

38:40.827 --> 38:47.827
I don't know, I'm just a crazy beer
drinking wrestler. Let's fart.

38:50.927 --> 38:56.727
You ass. You've got anything to
pick up at your place?

38:56.727 --> 39:00.427
Yeah, some rags and a radio.
Hey, we don't need a moving wan.

39:00.427 --> 39:01.427
Ah, let's go.

39:01.427 --> 39:09.427
But I wanna make myself look good.

39:23.427 --> 39:27.527
Hey Jim, can you hold this stuff
for me for a while?

39:27.527 --> 39:30.327
Yeah, sure.

39:34.027 --> 39:37.327
Last time I saw you, you've got nothing
neither a woman nor a radio.

39:37.327 --> 39:40.027
Hey, Jim. I'm used to radios.

39:40.027 --> 39:44.527
Wanda, this is Jim. Jim, this is Wanda.

39:44.527 --> 39:47.827
- Hi.
- Hi. Me beer.

39:47.827 --> 39:50.427
Yeah, likewise.

39:50.427 --> 39:55.427
Hey Jim, can you cash this check for me?
I signed him.

39:58.127 --> 40:00.427
Hey, what's this?

40:00.427 --> 40:04.827
You're not gonna believe this,
but that's an income tax refund.

40:04.827 --> 40:07.327
I found it in the mailbox of the old place.

40:07.327 --> 40:12.627
You mean, you worked last year?
Six month in a toy factory.
You don't know how men suffer for children.

40:12.627 --> 40:15.927
Hey, Henry. You're gonna buy one or be one.

40:15.927 --> 40:20.927
Hey, I'm gonna be one. Give her a beer.

40:33.227 --> 40:38.227
- Yes, sir?
- Shot of bark whiskey, please.

40:55.027 --> 41:02.027
- Hey, old timer. This one's on the house.
- I thank you.

41:08.727 --> 41:11.327
Thanx, Jim.

41:12.827 --> 41:17.827
<? ?>Take this.This covers the rent,
I'll keep the rest.

41:18.727 --> 41:22.427
You trust me?

41:22.427 --> 41:27.427
Why not? It's easier that way.

41:30.127 --> 41:33.127
Oh, look at this. Schifern Incorporated
- labourer, no experience.

41:33.127 --> 41:38.027
Oh, look at this. Shifrin Incorporated
- labourer, no experience.

41:38.027 --> 41:40.227
Hey, that's me.

41:40.227 --> 41:43.327
I'm gonna run down there,
I'm gonna hop on the pass.

41:43.327 --> 41:45.727
Henry, are you losing what's
left of your goddamned mind?

41:45.727 --> 41:49.527
You mean, you gonna leave me here all alone?

41:49.527 --> 41:54.527
All alone? Hey baby, there's Jim,
there is Lilly. Come on.

41:56.027 --> 41:58.527
What are you doing with a woman, Henry?

41:58.527 --> 42:03.427
Lilly, sometimes I think you could use one too.

42:03.427 --> 42:07.527
Four whiskeys.

42:07.527 --> 42:12.127
Look Hank, why don't you go tomorrow.
We just met.

42:12.127 --> 42:15.827
When you ran off like this,
I feel you're trying to get away from me.

42:15.827 --> 42:23.527
Hey, baby. I'm doing this for us.
We're be able to drink with class.

42:23.927 --> 42:28.927
We don't have to be barflies,
returned from the grave.

42:31.127 --> 42:36.127
- Thank you, bartender.
- Ok, oldtimer.

42:37.527 --> 42:39.627
Hey, he didn't pay.

42:39.627 --> 42:41.627
He already paid.

42:41.627 --> 42:44.927
Oh, god, I will get a job.

42:44.927 --> 42:49.927
Yeah, hey. To the working class. Right.

42:51.527 --> 42:56.527
- To us.
- To us. With gods help.

42:56.727 --> 43:00.027
No chance. Even the devil wouldn't have you.

43:00.027 --> 43:02.127
Hey, what's your problem?

43:02.127 --> 43:06.027
Hey, you got any of those little
mints for breath?

43:06.027 --> 43:11.027
Oh yeah. Baby.

43:17.827 --> 43:22.527
Excuse me, who are you?

43:22.527 --> 43:25.927
Hmm, the eternal question.

43:25.927 --> 43:32.027
The eternal answer: I don't know.

44:02.327 --> 44:07.327
- How do you explain this recent unemployment record?
- Hey, anybody didn't get a job.

44:08.027 --> 44:12.627
- Takes some man to make you a hard worker.
- Excuse me?

44:12.627 --> 44:15.627
Hey, I was just joking.

44:15.627 --> 44:18.427
Everything here seems to read 'none'.

44:18.427 --> 44:26.227
Hobbies none,  religion none, education none.
Even where they'd ask you sex you put none.

44:26.227 --> 44:30.727
Hardly none. Yeah, you can put down now.

44:30.727 --> 44:32.727
So, how did the job go?

44:32.727 --> 44:39.027
Oh, they gave me a hard on.
They couldn't use a hard on.

44:39.227 --> 44:42.827
This is a world where everybody's
gotta do something.

44:42.827 --> 44:49.027
You know somebody laid down this rule,
that everybody's gotta do something.
They've gotta be something

44:49.027 --> 44:57.027
You know, a dentist, a pilot, an arc,
a janitor, a preacher, all that.

44:57.827 --> 45:02.027
Sometimes, I just get tired of thinking
of all the things that I don't wanna do.

45:02.027 --> 45:12.027
All things that I don't wanna be.
All places that I don't wanna go,
like India, like get my teeth cleaned.

45:12.227 --> 45:17.227
Save the whale, all that. I don't understand that.

45:17.527 --> 45:20.627
You're not supposed to think about it.

45:20.627 --> 45:25.627
I think the whole trick is not to think about it.

45:29.227 --> 45:34.227
Oh, I guess Wanda went home, huh?

45:35.227 --> 45:40.227
- Henry.
- Yeah?

45:42.327 --> 45:49.227
Eddie came in with a fifth of burbon.
Tonight's his night of, Ben's working his shift.

45:49.227 --> 45:54.227
I won't miss Eddie tonight.

45:55.127 --> 46:00.127
Henry, Wanda left with Eddie.

46:02.027 --> 46:07.027
Huh? What?

46:09.027 --> 46:14.027
- Jim?
- Yeah?

46:14.827 --> 46:19.827
Scotch and water.

47:11.527 --> 47:16.527
Humanity, you never had it from the beginning.

47:50.027 --> 47:54.827
Hello.

47:54.827 --> 47:59.827
I paid the rent.

48:01.527 --> 48:04.327
Did you get the job?

48:04.327 --> 48:09.327
Yeah, I start tomorrow. Matred D Musso at Frank's.

48:17.027 --> 48:22.027
Listen, I told you not to leave me alone.

48:25.327 --> 48:31.827
- Don't hit me!
- Hit you? I'm not your goddamned pimp.

48:31.827 --> 48:34.427
Stop acting like one.

48:34.427 --> 48:39.427
Why it had to be Eddie?!?!

48:41.227 --> 48:46.227
- He symbolizes everything that disgusts me!
- What?

48:46.527 --> 48:53.027
Obviousness, unoriginal macho energy.

48:53.127 --> 48:56.027
Ladies man.

48:56.027 --> 49:01.027
You're right. He's not much.

49:04.127 --> 49:09.127
I made an error, an unhappy error,
but I'll drink.

49:09.827 --> 49:13.527
When I drink, I'm moving in
a wrong direction.

49:13.527 --> 49:18.527
You know, every time I get with a woman,
something happens.

49:19.027 --> 49:22.427
Sometimes it happens sooner,
sometimes it happens later.

49:22.427 --> 49:27.427
- This time it happened pretty fast.
- <? ?> you don't own me.

49:28.027 --> 49:33.027
Hey, that's right. Nobody owns anybody.

49:33.827 --> 49:37.127
I just thought, that we are something special.

49:37.127 --> 49:40.027
Because we're just green corn.

49:40.027 --> 49:45.027
Hey, what are we? Just people
that pass in hallways?

49:45.027 --> 49:48.427
I guess I expect too much.

49:48.427 --> 49:55.427
Hey, I can't handle this scene, you know.
I ought to be a fucking monk. Yeah.

50:11.827 --> 50:15.727
(phone rings)

50:15.727 --> 50:20.727
Hello?

50:21.027 --> 50:29.027
Natali Sorensen. I know this sound like
I'm a lunetic or something, but I have
this reason why I wish to talk to you.

50:35.327 --> 50:40.327
- Well, what you wanna do?
- Well, what can man do with a third rate chipi.

50:40.327 --> 50:44.227
- You keep talking like that and I'm leaving.
- I'll open the door for you.

50:44.227 --> 50:47.527
I'll be a gentleman.

50:47.527 --> 50:49.927
Go ahead.

50:49.927 --> 50:53.727
- OK, I'm going.
- Hope, you'll find a live one.

50:53.727 --> 50:58.727
You rotten son of a bitch.

51:00.827 --> 51:07.527
Oh, baby. Auch. What you...? What do ya...?
Auch, you've got something in there... Aaaauuuuuch.

51:18.927 --> 51:28.927
I think a dripping sink. An empty bottle.
Euphoria.

51:34.027 --> 51:44.027
Youth fenced in. Stamped. Shaven

51:44.327 --> 51:49.327
Tough words. <? ?>

52:04.327 --> 52:09.327
Are you Henry Chinaski?

52:10.127 --> 52:12.827
No, I'm Rion Spinks.

52:12.827 --> 52:18.827
You're looking in bad shape.
Should I call a doctor?

52:19.527 --> 52:24.527
Ooh, quite allright.

53:08.327 --> 53:10.727
Where's the body? You?

53:10.727 --> 53:12.027
There's no body.

53:12.027 --> 53:14.027
We've got a call, that somebody was dying.

53:14.027 --> 53:19.027
- Hey, everything is fine.
- You know what each of these calls cost the tax payer?

53:19.527 --> 53:23.727
- Jesus, why don't you turn your radio down?
- I can't find anybody.

53:23.727 --> 53:27.027
This this room 309, ain't it?

53:27.027 --> 53:31.027
So you didn't put in the call, did you?

53:31.027 --> 53:35.427
No, I didn't.

53:35.427 --> 53:38.127
All right, sign this buddy.

53:38.127 --> 53:43.127
Listen, you don't look so good.
Better go to bed or something.

53:43.727 --> 53:46.427
Are you gonna sign this buddy?

53:46.427 --> 53:51.027
This guy's fucking nuts.

53:51.027 --> 53:56.027
Right there, bellow the line.

53:57.327 --> 53:58.827
Get some sleep, you'll feel better.

53:58.827 --> 54:03.827
Come on, let's go, Lenny.

54:15.927 --> 54:20.927
Goddamn you.

54:59.627 --> 55:04.627
(phone rings)

55:05.027 --> 55:10.027
Hello?

55:10.627 --> 55:15.627
Oh yes, I'm allright.

55:16.727 --> 55:21.127
If I wanna see you?

55:21.127 --> 55:25.427
Well, you know what Tolstoy said. Tolstoy!

55:25.427 --> 55:38.427
Tolstoy said: "Regard the society
of women as a necessary unpleasentness of
life and avoided as much as possible.

55:38.527 --> 55:43.027
What?

55:43.027 --> 55:49.527
Why? Yes, I know. Hey.
I know that I'm in your apartment,
but I paid this month's rent.

55:49.527 --> 55:55.527
Yes. Sure, I can always use a drink.

55:56.427 --> 56:00.127
What you've said you're calling from?

56:00.127 --> 56:05.127
Oh, allright. I'll see you in a minute.

57:00.227 --> 57:03.027
How's your head?

57:03.027 --> 57:08.027
Oh, my head needs a beer.

57:08.527 --> 57:11.527
The booze is on Willbur Evans.

57:11.527 --> 57:16.527
It's probably the last time,
I won't be able to run on him.

57:18.727 --> 57:23.727
I guess it's not fair on Willbur,
but he's got nothing but money.

57:24.827 --> 57:29.827
Ooh, poor Willbur.

57:34.527 --> 57:39.527
What did you do when I was gone?

57:42.727 --> 57:47.727
Where the hell are my panties?

57:49.627 --> 57:52.727
Where the hell is anything?

57:52.727 --> 57:56.027
Did an earthquake hit this place?

57:56.027 --> 57:59.527
Oh, well, I was looking for a lottery ticket.

57:59.527 --> 58:02.627
You don't play the lottery.

58:02.627 --> 58:07.627
Oh, well, I. hahaha

58:10.027 --> 58:12.927
Is your head really allright?

58:12.927 --> 58:17.927
It's just fine.

58:36.727 --> 58:44.727
- What did you say?
- Oh, it's hatred. It's the only thing that lasts.

58:47.327 --> 58:52.027
That guy beats his old lady and
I hear he killed two guys.

58:52.027 --> 58:55.027
Oh, shit. What the fuck's he doing out?

58:55.027 --> 58:57.027
I don't know.

58:57.027 --> 59:00.027
He killed one man, they put him in,
and he got out, killed that oher guy
and now he's out again.

59:00.027 --> 59:05.027
He killed one man, they put him in,
and he got out, killed that other guy
and now he's out again.

59:06.527 --> 59:11.027
Maybe it was selfdefence or maybe
it's our penal system.

59:11.027 --> 59:14.127
Anyhow, he's out on parole.

59:14.127 --> 59:19.127
He must jack off his parole officer,
when he comes around.

59:22.327 --> 59:26.327
- I'm getting out.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

59:26.327 --> 59:31.327
= Get up you whore!

59:40.727 --> 59:45.427
Maybe this guy had a reason for killing.

59:45.427 --> 59:50.427
Hey, most people think they do.

59:56.327 --> 01:00:01.327
<? What we're gonna do ?>

01:00:01.427 --> 01:00:08.427
Well, us? Us is gonna drink, I hope.

01:00:09.927 --> 01:00:14.927
Pour me one then.

01:00:15.527 --> 01:00:20.527
Thanks.

01:00:25.727 --> 01:00:29.427
I feel kind of sleepy.

01:00:29.427 --> 01:00:34.427
I don't know what it is.
The booze or what, but ...

01:00:38.727 --> 01:00:44.727
- I need a nap.
- Hey, you'll go ahead, I'll watch things.

01:00:45.527 --> 01:00:52.027
By the way, I didn't get that job.

01:00:54.227 --> 01:00:58.027
Tomorrow is lighter.

01:00:58.027 --> 01:01:04.027
I've been a waitress, a typist.

01:01:05.327 --> 01:01:08.727
I can do it again.

01:01:08.727 --> 01:01:13.727
Hey, you don't have to do anything.
I'll work something out.

01:02:00.827 --> 01:02:05.527
This thing upon me, like a flower and a feast.

01:02:05.527 --> 01:02:10.027
This thing upon me, crawling like a snake.

01:02:10.027 --> 01:02:14.927
It's not death, but dying will solve it's power.

01:02:14.927 --> 01:02:21.027
And as my hands drop the last desperate pen.
It's an cheap room.

01:02:21.427 --> 01:02:26.527
They will find me there. I never
know my name, my meaning.

01:02:26.527 --> 01:02:31.527
I know the treasure of my escape.

01:02:35.027 --> 01:02:39.027
Henry?

01:02:39.027 --> 01:02:41.327
Yes, what is it?

01:02:41.327 --> 01:02:46.327
- Are you there?
- Yes, I'm right here.

01:02:48.027 --> 01:02:53.027
Henry, I'm going to die.

01:02:53.527 --> 01:02:55.227
What?

01:02:59.627 --> 01:03:04.627
I'm gonna die.

01:03:04.827 --> 01:03:09.827
I just saw this angel.

01:03:10.027 --> 01:03:15.027
He came to take me.

01:03:15.327 --> 01:03:20.327
And huge white wings.

01:03:21.027 --> 01:03:25.927
He spread all across the room.

01:03:25.927 --> 01:03:30.927
He's beautiful. Glowing.

01:03:34.727 --> 01:03:38.027
He came to take me.

01:03:38.027 --> 01:03:42.427
Hey. Hey, it gonna be all right.

01:03:42.427 --> 01:03:47.427
Henry.

01:03:47.527 --> 01:03:52.227
You better call an ambulance.

01:03:52.227 --> 01:03:55.527
- You better call an ambulance.
- An ambulance?

01:03:55.527 --> 01:03:59.827
I can't breath.

01:03:59.827 --> 01:04:04.827
Henry? I'm going..

01:04:08.027 --> 01:04:12.927
Hello, operator. I need an ambulance.

01:04:12.927 --> 01:04:17.927
(sirens)

01:04:28.527 --> 01:04:32.727
Oh, jesus!! What you guys work the day
shift and the night shift too?

01:04:32.727 --> 01:04:37.727
- I'm gonna ask you the same thing.
- This time he's got the body.

01:04:42.527 --> 01:04:47.527
Hey, sign here.

01:04:48.627 --> 01:04:53.627
Don't you change your underwear?

01:04:53.827 --> 01:04:56.827
- Sorry.
- Don't be sorry, just change your underwear.

01:04:56.827 --> 01:05:01.827
No more calls here tonight, buddy, 'cause
I won't answer anymore calls here tonight.

01:05:03.027 --> 01:05:07.927
- What about Wanda?
- Wanda's just drunk and besides that she's too fat.

01:05:07.927 --> 01:05:12.927
Come on Harry, let's get out of here.

01:05:14.827 --> 01:05:17.727
Did you hear what that son of a bitch said?

01:05:17.727 --> 01:05:22.427
- He said you're allright.
- That son of a bitch said I was too fat.

01:05:22.427 --> 01:05:26.327
He had no right to say that.
Do you think I'm too fat, Henry?

01:05:26.327 --> 01:05:33.327
- Oh, no, no. You're just right, you're perfect.
- I thought so. Thank you.

01:05:34.527 --> 01:05:39.527
Look, if you're going after a job in the morning,
you better get some sleep.

01:05:40.427 --> 01:05:42.927
All right.

01:05:42.927 --> 01:05:45.927
I really saw that angel.

01:05:45.927 --> 01:05:49.227
His wings were moving.

01:05:49.227 --> 01:05:52.427
Well, I'm glad he had the wrong address.

01:05:52.427 --> 01:05:55.927
I would have missed you badly.

01:05:55.927 --> 01:06:00.927
You're lying as a baby.

01:06:01.027 --> 01:06:05.627
Hey walk, you're hung over,
why don't you go another day? Huh?

01:06:05.627 --> 01:06:08.227
When you're feeling better

01:06:08.227 --> 01:06:11.527
go look for a job.

01:06:11.527 --> 01:06:14.427
What do you want me to do?
Go back to my drunken bable?

01:06:14.427 --> 01:06:18.627
Yes.

01:06:18.627 --> 01:06:21.527
The angel came.

01:06:21.527 --> 01:06:24.427
That was a warning to get straight.

01:06:24.427 --> 01:06:26.927
Hey. You don't believe in that
crap, do you?

01:06:26.927 --> 01:06:31.927
Sure. More crap you believe in,
the more better off you are.

01:06:33.727 --> 01:06:38.727
<? I could use ?> cigarette.

01:06:39.727 --> 01:06:44.727
- Where the hell you're going, anyhow?
- Got a couple of places in mind.

01:06:46.927 --> 01:06:49.327
Don't you have a match?

01:06:49.327 --> 01:06:51.027
- Hey buddy?
- Huh?

01:06:51.027 --> 01:06:54.427
You've got a light?

01:06:54.427 --> 01:06:59.427
Well, indeed, I do have light.

01:07:06.427 --> 01:07:11.327
- Thank you very much, sir.
- The pleasure is more than mine sir.

01:07:11.327 --> 01:07:16.327
And my lady.

01:07:18.227 --> 01:07:23.227
See. The angels are everywhere.

01:07:24.127 --> 01:07:27.027
It's time those fuckers came out of hiding.

01:07:27.027 --> 01:07:29.727
- Do you have busfare?
- Yeah, wish me luck.

01:07:29.727 --> 01:07:34.727
Ey, good luck.

01:07:42.027 --> 01:07:47.027
- Mr. Chi..?
- Blake, Will Blake.

01:07:49.327 --> 01:07:54.327
You're Henry Chinaski.

01:07:54.527 --> 01:07:59.527
- I tried your dorm....
- Hey, what da fuck is goin' on out there?!!

01:08:01.027 --> 01:08:06.027
You weren't <? ?>

01:08:06.027 --> 01:08:10.827
I decided to wait a bit.

01:08:10.827 --> 01:08:17.027
All right, I am Chinaski, but I don't
own any money, so if you're from the
collection agency, you can forget about it.

01:08:17.027 --> 01:08:21.227
No, I'm Tally Sarenson.

01:08:21.227 --> 01:08:25.527
We've met each other in that bar.

01:08:25.527 --> 01:08:30.426
Come on, please!

01:08:30.426 --> 01:08:33.227
Can I come in for a moment?

01:08:33.227 --> 01:08:38.227
Well, uuuh.

01:08:38.827 --> 01:08:43.827
Look, I'm not gonna consume you.

01:08:46.827 --> 01:08:50.327
All right.

01:08:50.327 --> 01:08:52.127
Go ahead.

01:08:59.027 --> 01:09:01.027
I feel entirely foolish.

01:09:01.027 --> 01:09:02.527
But how come?

01:09:02.527 --> 01:09:05.027
Just, just walking in here.

01:09:05.027 --> 01:09:07.827
Hmmm, would you care for a beer?

01:09:07.827 --> 01:09:12.827
- Thank you.
- Ok.

01:09:27.227 --> 01:09:31.527
I'm one of the main producers of the
contemporary review of art and literature.

01:09:31.527 --> 01:09:34.727
Oh, producer?

01:09:34.727 --> 01:09:37.727
I own a magazine.

01:09:37.727 --> 01:09:38.827
- So?

01:09:38.827 --> 01:09:43.827
So, we have discovered you.

01:09:46.426 --> 01:09:50.827
Oh, I had an  idea, that I'd be
discovered after my death.

01:09:50.827 --> 01:09:54.527
You look well on way. You might be our deadline.

01:09:54.527 --> 01:09:57.327
Hey, what's with this deadline, huh?

01:09:57.327 --> 01:10:01.527
Don't you remember?
You've sent us dozens of stories.

01:10:01.527 --> 01:10:05.527
You can't doubt it <? ?>

01:10:05.527 --> 01:10:08.627
I don't think so.

01:10:08.627 --> 01:10:16.027
- Why did you send your stuff to us?
- Well, I like the title of the mag.

01:10:16.027 --> 01:10:21.027
Why don't you stop drinking?
Anybody can be a drunk.

01:10:23.527 --> 01:10:27.227
Anybody can be a nondrunk.

01:10:27.227 --> 01:10:31.527
It takes a special talent to be a drunk.

01:10:31.527 --> 01:10:38.027
It takes endurance. Endurance is more
important than truth.

01:10:38.027 --> 01:10:43.027
Anyhow, you've had some luck.
We've decided to accept your last story.

01:10:43.727 --> 01:10:48.727
And we pay upon acceptance.

01:10:54.627 --> 01:10:57.527
You've changed you're address
quite a bit, don't you?

01:10:57.527 --> 01:11:01.327
I had to hire a private detective to find you.

01:11:01.327 --> 01:11:08.327
Oooh, the guy in the hat, right?
Hey, hahaha.

01:11:11.127 --> 01:11:15.327
Oh, hey, wait. I can't cash this
fucking thing.

01:11:15.327 --> 01:11:23.027
Ok, whore, this is it. I can't stand
it another minute. You're like a leech
sucking off my mind.

01:11:23.027 --> 01:11:30.027
Be aware of me. This is it, for help
me Christ, I'm gonna finish you off now.

01:11:30.027 --> 01:11:31.127
Please no.

01:11:31.127 --> 01:11:33.027
You wait here, I'll be back.

01:11:33.027 --> 01:11:38.027
Loui, Noo, Noo, Nooo! Ahhhhh.

01:11:47.227 --> 01:11:50.127
Hey, man, you've got a search warrant?

01:11:50.127 --> 01:11:55.127
You owe me for a lock and a door.

01:11:59.027 --> 01:12:01.427
Hey, I don't like the way you're handling your woman.

01:12:01.427 --> 01:12:04.827
<? Are you a poli? ?> Where you're from anyhow?

01:12:04.827 --> 01:12:07.327
Don't ya know, she likes it?

01:12:07.327 --> 01:12:09.527
Fucking, right!

01:12:09.527 --> 01:12:13.027
You've get your ass out of here, buster.

01:12:13.027 --> 01:12:19.527
We don't need no fucking clearance to
play around here! And move out!

01:12:19.527 --> 01:12:24.527
Ehhe, it's love you see?
Anything else bothering you?

01:12:25.027 --> 01:12:30.027
Yeah.

01:12:30.027 --> 01:12:33.027
I don't like you.

01:12:33.027 --> 01:12:38.027
That's just the nature of the
way things work. I don't like you.

01:12:39.327 --> 01:12:43.027
You don't like me.

01:12:43.027 --> 01:12:49.027
Wait. Hey, man, watch this one!

01:12:51.027 --> 01:12:56.027
Ok, let's go killer.

01:13:14.627 --> 01:13:19.227
Nothing but damn luck, motherfucker.

01:13:19.227 --> 01:13:24.227
Yeah, but that counts too.

01:13:27.627 --> 01:13:36.027
Hello, hello I need an ambulance. Royal apartments,
334 Westlake place, South.

01:13:36.027 --> 01:13:39.727
It's apartment 308. And hurry up.

01:13:39.727 --> 01:13:42.727
A man is dying.

01:13:42.727 --> 01:13:47.727
No I tell ya it's for real this time.
There a guy on the floor, gutted.

01:13:49.927 --> 01:13:52.427
Ok, hurry.

01:13:52.427 --> 01:13:57.427
Hey, baby, we've got to get out of here.

01:13:58.627 --> 01:14:02.027
I tell you it was an accident,
that sucker tried to kill me.

01:14:02.027 --> 01:14:03.427
It was like God intervened.

01:14:03.427 --> 01:14:07.727
- What happened?
- Wasn't my fault, he fell on his knife.

01:14:07.727 --> 01:14:10.027
Shouldn't we tell the police?

01:14:10.027 --> 01:14:17.027
I don't want to make a new discovery in jail;
Hey, they've got the wrong kind of bars in those places.

01:14:18.427 --> 01:14:23.327
Give me the cheque,
I'll go in and get it cashed for ya.

01:14:23.327 --> 01:14:28.327
Hey, what's up?

01:15:00.027 --> 01:15:03.127
Hey, baby.

01:15:03.127 --> 01:15:08.027
Hmm, you know, for 75$, I'll suck you till
your asshole rumbles like a volcano.

01:15:08.027 --> 01:15:13.027
- Oh, I can alway tell a class lady when I see one.
- Faggot!

01:15:25.427 --> 01:15:28.027
Five hundred dollars.

01:15:28.027 --> 01:15:33.027
Oh, thanks much, really. There've been many
angels around here lately.

01:15:33.427 --> 01:15:36.527
Which way, my dear angel?

01:15:36.527 --> 01:15:40.327
- Bitch!

01:15:40.327 --> 01:15:45.327
Bitch you're fuckin' with a faggot!
What you've gonna do with him, when you get home?

01:15:47.327 --> 01:15:49.127
What was all that about?

01:15:49.127 --> 01:15:54.127
This <? ?>. She doesn't know a damn thing about me.

01:15:54.827 --> 01:15:59.827
- But I know something about you.
- Really?

01:16:00.227 --> 01:16:02.727
You've been jailed twelve times.

01:16:02.727 --> 01:16:07.727
You like Mahler and Mozart, <? ?>.

01:16:09.727 --> 01:16:16.527
You hate movies. You like avocados and Schopenheimer.

01:16:16.527 --> 01:16:19.327
Sound's like your man did his homework, baby.

01:16:19.327 --> 01:16:22.027
When I read your stories, I had to find out.

01:16:22.027 --> 01:16:26.527
They made me feel.

01:16:26.527 --> 01:16:30.027
And they made me curious, very curious.

01:16:30.027 --> 01:16:34.527
You've been really right. Why do you live like a bum?

01:16:34.527 --> 01:16:42.827
I am a bum. What do you want me to do?
You want me to write about the sufferings
of the upper classes?

01:16:44.927 --> 01:16:47.027
This is maybe news to you, but they suffer too.

01:16:47.027 --> 01:16:50.527
Heey. Hey, baby.

01:16:50.527 --> 01:16:54.727
Nobody suffers like the poor.

01:16:54.727 --> 01:16:58.227
Little worried about that guy,
who've got knifed.

01:16:58.227 --> 01:17:03.227
Think he got it in the side.
If he'd get in the stomach, that's bad.

01:17:08.727 --> 01:17:12.527
Fuck you!

01:17:12.527 --> 01:17:14.727
Maybe, they're in love.

01:17:14.727 --> 01:17:19.627
Aah, you call that love? I call it
unoriginal exhibition.

01:17:19.627 --> 01:17:23.027
Maybe, it's only that you want to be
that one who's kissing her.

01:17:23.027 --> 01:17:26.527
Maybe. I don't put it down on parade.

01:17:26.527 --> 01:17:28.627
Why can't you be more romantic?

01:17:28.627 --> 01:17:32.027
Think of love as being, say on a rollercoaster.

01:17:32.027 --> 01:17:37.027
Look at these vain idiots. What they
really need is a little dent.

01:17:37.527 --> 01:17:42.527
That's the way they like it.

01:17:43.727 --> 01:17:45.027
- Are you crazy?
- Yes.

01:17:45.027 --> 01:17:50.027
Stop it!

01:18:01.627 --> 01:18:06.627
That whole thinh was dumb, childish, the desperate
act of a spoiled asshole.

01:18:08.927 --> 01:18:13.927
So you hired a dick to find an asshole.

01:18:16.027 --> 01:18:20.027
Take the left to this black gate with no one out.

01:18:20.027 --> 01:18:25.027
Hey, open sesamy.

01:18:25.827 --> 01:18:30.327
What do you want to be, when you grow up.

01:18:30.327 --> 01:18:35.327
Hey Talia, I'm not pretending to be anything.
That's the point.

01:18:36.027 --> 01:18:41.027
I'm glad this' the point.

01:18:41.727 --> 01:18:46.727
That's the guesthouse.

01:18:52.127 --> 01:18:57.127
- Do you need a drink?
- Yeah, like a spider needs a fly.

01:19:04.127 --> 01:19:06.327
I'll get the drinks.

01:19:32.227 --> 01:19:36.727
- You're the bartender.
- Ok.

01:19:36.727 --> 01:19:39.027
How does it feel to be on the other end?

01:19:39.027 --> 01:19:44.027
Oh, either way is greatest,
when the bottle pours.

01:19:44.027 --> 01:19:47.527
It seems to be a limited world.

01:19:47.527 --> 01:19:49.827
Is there anything else to it?

01:19:49.827 --> 01:19:54.827
No, it's a selfsufficient illusion.

01:19:56.027 --> 01:20:01.027
One of my editors left those here.

01:20:31.727 --> 01:20:36.727
You know. In the guesthouse
you could write in peace.

01:20:37.627 --> 01:20:42.627
Hey, tell me baby, nobody who could write
worth a damn could ever write in peace.

01:20:46.627 --> 01:20:51.627
I take it, you don't care for my world.

01:20:51.727 --> 01:20:56.727
Baby, look around it's a cage with golden bars.

01:21:07.027 --> 01:21:11.527
You better go now.

01:21:11.527 --> 01:21:16.527
I'm sorry for all of this,
I'm not used to drink.

01:21:20.127 --> 01:21:25.127
Hey, Tally.

01:21:27.527 --> 01:21:32.527
- I'd better sleep now.
- Where's the bedroom?

01:21:36.027 --> 01:21:39.227
There you go.

01:21:39.227 --> 01:21:44.227
I can't sleep with my clothes on.

01:21:44.427 --> 01:21:49.427
Hey, wait a moment.

01:22:18.627 --> 01:22:23.327
Tally. Tally, baby.

01:22:23.327 --> 01:22:27.527
- Hey, Tally baby.
- What is it?

01:22:27.527 --> 01:22:32.527
I've gotta go.

01:22:34.827 --> 01:22:39.827
What is it?

01:22:40.227 --> 01:22:42.327
What went wrong?

01:22:42.327 --> 01:22:46.527
Look, baby. I belong on the streets.

01:22:46.527 --> 01:22:49.327
I don't feel right here.

01:22:49.327 --> 01:22:56.927
- I feel like I can't breath.
- You're just not used to easiness.
You can grow into it.

01:22:56.927 --> 01:23:01.427
Hey, baby. Grow's for plants.
I hate roots.

01:23:01.427 --> 01:23:07.027
You had all this feeling in your stories.
I thought maybe it came from you.

01:23:07.027 --> 01:23:13.427
- I'm sorry, I've gotta go.
- No I'm not gonna cry.

01:23:13.827 --> 01:23:18.827
You fooled me, that's all, it's been done before.

01:23:19.627 --> 01:23:26.627
- Hey, Tally. I didn't mean to do anything ugly.
- Get out.

01:24:09.927 --> 01:24:13.827
Hey, Wanda.

01:24:13.827 --> 01:24:18.827
Wanda. Hey, Wanda.

01:24:19.327 --> 01:24:25.827
- Where the hell have you been?
- Fetch you a little drink.

01:24:25.827 --> 01:24:30.027
Where've you been?

01:24:30.027 --> 01:24:33.027
I smell it. Parfume.

01:24:33.027 --> 01:24:35.527
Get away from me, you pig!

01:24:35.527 --> 01:24:40.227
Hey, you're crazy.

01:24:40.227 --> 01:24:45.227
Look, what I've found.

01:24:46.327 --> 01:24:48.727
That's frightening.

01:24:48.727 --> 01:24:55.527
- What have you done? Did you kill somebody?
- Yeah.

01:25:10.927 --> 01:25:15.927
That's for you, before the angel
comes and takes you away.

01:25:17.227 --> 01:25:20.027
You crazy ass.

01:25:20.027 --> 01:25:25.027
How about a refill?

01:25:27.527 --> 01:25:32.527
Ooh.

01:25:33.527 --> 01:25:35.927
Hey, what're you doin'?

01:25:35.927 --> 01:25:39.527
Dressing.

01:25:39.527 --> 01:25:42.527
I know, but why?

01:25:42.527 --> 01:25:49.527
I just can't stand lying under that
cover of money. I feel so dumb.

01:25:50.027 --> 01:25:53.427
Hey, money isn't dumb.

01:25:53.427 --> 01:25:56.227
They say it talks, you know.

01:25:56.227 --> 01:26:00.627
By the way, cops came by.

01:26:00.627 --> 01:26:02.727
- Came by where? Here?
- No, not here.

01:26:02.727 --> 01:26:07.727
It was next door 308, two ambulance
guys carried him out.

01:26:08.327 --> 01:26:11.227
He've been knifed.

01:26:11.227 --> 01:26:12.827
Was he alive?

01:26:12.827 --> 01:26:16.427
He must have been,he smoked on his cigarette.

01:26:16.427 --> 01:26:19.027
Oh, great.

01:26:19.027 --> 01:26:23.827
Henry, I didn't get the job.

01:26:23.827 --> 01:26:27.027
That's ok.

01:26:27.027 --> 01:26:30.827
We're gonna take that money and
we're gonna go to the bar.

01:26:30.827 --> 01:26:35.827
- And we're gonna celebrate. Ok?
- All right.

01:26:38.027 --> 01:26:43.027
Hey, Henry!

01:27:00.127 --> 01:27:02.527
Yeah?

01:27:02.527 --> 01:27:07.527
- Scotch on the rocks.
- Oh, the same and I'm buying for the house.

01:27:11.427 --> 01:27:16.427
Look, your credit's no good here.
You've got to have the green.

01:27:24.827 --> 01:27:27.427
This can't be true.

01:27:27.427 --> 01:27:32.427
Start <? ?>, my friends are thirsty.

01:27:36.027 --> 01:27:39.227
- <? ?> Henry.
- Friday night.

01:27:39.227 --> 01:27:44.227
Eddie's gonna jab you tonight. <? ?>

01:27:47.427 --> 01:27:52.327
It's too late for that.

01:27:52.327 --> 01:27:54.327
Eddie would think I was <? running ?>.

01:27:54.327 --> 01:27:58.527
You care what he thinks? Huh?

01:27:58.527 --> 01:28:07.927
Hey, if Eddie whips me, you're goin'
home with him tonight?

01:28:07.927 --> 01:28:11.527
One mistake is enough for me.

01:28:11.527 --> 01:28:15.427
It's you and me.

01:28:15.427 --> 01:28:17.127
But, I'll tell you something.

01:28:17.127 --> 01:28:22.127
If I find that one you went to bed with,
I'll rip all her parts of.

01:28:22.527 --> 01:28:27.527
Oh, honey it wasn't me.

01:28:41.127 --> 01:28:46.127
Hello my friends!

01:28:48.027 --> 01:28:53.027
Eddie, you're in too. Pour youself a drink.

01:28:56.427 --> 01:29:01.427
Listen, you owe me forty bucks.

01:29:04.127 --> 01:29:08.227
Here, keep the change. Pour yourself a drink.

01:29:08.227 --> 01:29:10.427
Go buy yourself some bubblegum.

01:29:10.427 --> 01:29:13.527
Give everybody a new round. Yeah.

01:29:13.527 --> 01:29:18.527
Listen punk, I'm gonna tell you something.
Last time I fought you I had the flu.

01:29:19.627 --> 01:29:23.027
What's it gonna be this time, the hayhays?

01:29:23.027 --> 01:29:26.027
Now come on, start trotting, boy.

01:29:26.027 --> 01:29:31.027
I'll fucking pour you. I'm making a phone call.

01:29:31.627 --> 01:29:33.727
Hey, let me get you a hamburger. Huh?

01:29:33.727 --> 01:29:38.327
Aaah. I want a steak. Stuffed with whiskey.

01:29:38.327 --> 01:29:43.127
Look Henry. Henry, get some sleep. Fight him
tomorrow after a couple of meals.

01:29:43.127 --> 01:29:48.027
Heeey. Hey! I can't back down now.

01:29:48.027 --> 01:29:51.827
It's not fair he's pouring those drinks.
He's ready for ya Henry.

01:29:51.827 --> 01:29:56.827
Hey. His kind is no problem. One good punch
and he's bursting up looking for the exit.

01:29:58.327 --> 01:30:01.227
You owe me 42.50.

01:30:01.227 --> 01:30:06.227
Here baby, keep the change. Maybe you get a
taxi back to your room tonight.

01:30:07.827 --> 01:30:13.927
To all my friends. To all my friends.

01:30:16.027 --> 01:30:19.427
Henry. Thank you, Henry. Thank you.

01:30:19.427 --> 01:30:24.427
Oh, all my friends.

01:30:36.027 --> 01:30:41.027
- What is this, take out service now?
- Yeah.

01:30:50.027 --> 01:30:53.627
- Oh, shit.
- What?

01:30:53.627 --> 01:30:58.627
I mean, drink up.

01:31:02.027 --> 01:31:04.027
Come on in boys.

01:31:27.027 --> 01:31:29.027
Henry, I want to talk to you.

01:31:29.027 --> 01:31:34.327
hey. I told you, I didnt want that
cage with the golden bars.

01:31:34.327 --> 01:31:36.127
Who is this?

01:31:36.127 --> 01:31:43.127
Wanda, this is Tally. Tally, this is Wanda.

01:31:43.627 --> 01:31:47.027
Henry, I'm gonna scurry on over there for a few minutes.

01:31:47.027 --> 01:31:50.827
Hey, Eddie. Drink for the lady.

01:31:50.827 --> 01:31:55.827
Vodka, Eddie.

01:31:56.827 --> 01:32:01.527
- Tally is a publisher, she took
one of my short stories.
- Yeah?

01:32:01.527 --> 01:32:04.427
What else did she take?

01:32:04.427 --> 01:32:09.027
Excuse me, I don't want to be rude,
but haven't I seen you before?

01:32:09.027 --> 01:32:17.627
- Are you a friend of Henry's?
- Yeah, I'm a real good friend of Henry's.

01:32:17.627 --> 01:32:20.127
How about you?

01:32:20.127 --> 01:32:24.927
Well. Henry and I are quite...

01:32:24.927 --> 01:32:28.627
I'll say you are.

01:32:28.627 --> 01:32:30.327
That's the parfume.

01:32:30.327 --> 01:32:34.927
Hey. Look girls, there's realy nothing to get upset about.

01:32:34.927 --> 01:32:39.927
Let's have a few drinks and listen to some jukebox music.

01:32:40.527 --> 01:32:43.027
Who's gonna pay for that drink?

01:32:43.027 --> 01:32:48.027
- I'm gonna separate you from your parts you westside bitch!
- You get away from me!

01:32:49.027 --> 01:32:52.127
I just want to talk to Henry for a minute.

01:32:52.127 --> 01:32:57.127
I asked, who's gonna pay for that goddamned drink?

01:32:59.027 --> 01:33:03.927
- Here.
- Thank you.

01:33:03.927 --> 01:33:08.927
Now look girls. Be realistic.

01:33:09.027 --> 01:33:12.127
None of us hardly know one another.

01:33:12.127 --> 01:33:17.127
Basically, strangers to each other.

01:33:17.627 --> 01:33:21.627
Heh, we've passed one night and

01:33:21.627 --> 01:33:25.027
Wanda and me met in a bar.

01:33:25.027 --> 01:33:29.327
Be realistic, there's no way,
there's no reality to any of this.

01:33:29.327 --> 01:33:32.727
Another round of the drinks.

01:33:32.727 --> 01:33:36.527
If you don't get out of here, I'm gonna
peel you away from your parfume.

01:33:36.527 --> 01:33:41.527
- I have a drink and I attempt to sit here and drink it.
- Really?

01:34:45.827 --> 01:34:50.627
Just get out of here now, before I finish you off.

01:34:50.627 --> 01:34:55.627
All right. I know you need this.
Good luck. Goodbye.

01:35:20.327 --> 01:35:25.327
To all my friends!

01:35:28.427 --> 01:35:33.427
Come on my friends.

01:35:37.027 --> 01:35:42.027
Let's drink up!

01:35:58.627 --> 01:36:03.627
You're gonna fight him again? Hahaha, that's a laugh!
