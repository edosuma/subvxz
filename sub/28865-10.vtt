WEBVTT

00:05.695 --> 00:06.990
- Chookity.
- <i>Three days.</i>

00:07.078 --> 00:09.220
<i>Restoration
cycle is complete.</i>

00:09.307 --> 00:10.544
Chookity!
Gar! Gar! Gar!

00:10.632 --> 00:11.867
Hey, little buddy.

00:11.955 --> 00:13.292
You were
pretty banged up.

00:13.380 --> 00:14.763
Two centimeters
to the left,

00:14.851 --> 00:16.745
and we wouldn't
be talking right now.

00:16.832 --> 00:18.132
Yeah.

00:18.385 --> 00:20.784
I saw her.
I saw Quinn.

00:20.968 --> 00:22.021
And?

00:22.109 --> 00:24.060
I don't know if I'll ever
see her again.

00:24.148 --> 00:27.756
I knew our friendship would
keep you alive, and it did.

00:27.843 --> 00:29.378
It did.

00:29.465 --> 00:31.139
Clarence?
Rats!

00:31.226 --> 00:33.037
You were so close!

00:33.124 --> 00:35.593
So close to death!

00:35.681 --> 00:37.038
No!

00:37.126 --> 00:38.606
What are you doing
with all my stuff?

00:38.694 --> 00:39.803
Dividing it up.

00:39.890 --> 00:41.810
So rude of you to survive
like this.

00:41.898 --> 00:44.152
I was going to take
your big thumper, Gary.

00:44.239 --> 00:45.445
- You don't say.
- And put it

00:45.550 --> 00:47.052
with the rest
of my collection.

00:47.140 --> 00:49.437
Don't worry,
you're the only heart.

00:49.589 --> 00:50.883
The rest are spleens.

00:50.970 --> 00:52.539
I'm... honored?

00:52.703 --> 00:56.810
You were in a very advanced
form of almost being dead,

00:56.898 --> 00:59.865
But you stared Father Death
in the eyes and said,

00:59.953 --> 01:02.779
"Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
you can't have me!

01:02.867 --> 01:05.927
Go back to the shanty
from whence you came, Death!"

01:06.015 --> 01:07.658
All right.
What are you talk...

01:07.781 --> 01:09.437
Wait, where's
Little Cato?

01:09.643 --> 01:11.851
What is it?
He left.

01:11.968 --> 01:13.560
Gary, I tried
to stop him.

01:13.726 --> 01:17.461
I reached out my hand like this,
and I said "No, don't go."

01:17.632 --> 01:20.031
But he just casually
walked around me.

01:20.240 --> 01:22.310
Oh, wow,
you did all that?

01:22.398 --> 01:25.820
What good is a body
if none will respect it?

01:26.281 --> 01:27.820
Gary, after
Little Cato left,

01:27.914 --> 01:29.375
we received
this transmission.

01:29.509 --> 01:32.984
Gary, if you're seeing this,
then you're alive

01:33.072 --> 01:34.562
and you know that I'm gone.

01:34.882 --> 01:36.710
Some things you can't
come back from.

01:37.253 --> 01:38.719
I shot my father.

01:38.937 --> 01:42.831
I don't belong here
or anywhere anymore.

01:43.039 --> 01:44.875
I'm going as far away
as I can.

01:45.007 --> 01:47.937
And please,
don't come after me.

01:48.134 --> 01:49.225
We're going after him.

01:49.313 --> 01:50.648
I knew you'd say that,
so I record

01:50.736 --> 01:52.078
a second message to say,

01:52.166 --> 01:55.669
"For real,
do not come after me!"

01:55.757 --> 01:56.818
We're going after him.

01:56.906 --> 01:58.263
Nightfall, trace
the message.

01:58.351 --> 02:01.046
Done. He sent it from this
planet, Galang-22.

02:01.140 --> 02:03.747
Oh, oh, wow. Okay.
Well, then set course for...

02:03.835 --> 02:06.199
We're already there, Gary.
Try to keep up.

02:06.286 --> 02:09.408
My word!
This... G... great work!

02:09.496 --> 02:10.625
Little Cato is out there,

02:10.713 --> 02:12.890
and he needs us now
more than ever.

02:12.983 --> 02:15.656
Don't worry, Gary.
I'll bring him back.

02:15.744 --> 02:16.899
Dead or alive.

02:16.987 --> 02:18.490
What? No.
No, not dead!

02:18.578 --> 02:19.724
Alive, only alive!

02:19.812 --> 02:22.570
Right, only alive.

02:22.716 --> 02:24.287
I think we're on
the same page.

02:24.375 --> 02:26.732
No, we're not. All right?
We're not even in the same book.

02:26.820 --> 02:30.156
Right, but we're in
the same library.

02:30.244 --> 02:31.293
No, stop the winking.

02:31.380 --> 02:32.966
- I'm not winking.
- Don't wink at me.

02:33.054 --> 02:34.583
If anyone's winking,
it's you.

02:34.671 --> 02:35.858
You're still winking.
Stop the winking.

02:35.945 --> 02:37.810
- I'm blinking normally.
- Will you stop it?

02:37.898 --> 02:39.591
I love to
alternate blinks.

02:39.679 --> 02:41.771
- Is that a crime?
- Why are you winking at me?!

02:41.859 --> 02:45.238
Please do not kill
Little Cato.

02:45.437 --> 02:48.568
Oh, do not
kill Little Cato!

02:49.757 --> 02:52.078
That almost
ended up badly.

We're not leaving here
without him.

03:26.228 --> 03:27.556
Everyone, split up.

03:27.643 --> 03:29.185
Oh, hey!
Have you seen my boy?

03:29.273 --> 03:31.343
I mean, he's my friend's boy,
a boy I know.

03:31.431 --> 03:32.826
- He's my friend. He's...
- Mm-hmm.

03:32.914 --> 03:34.422
I guess you could
say he's my boyfriend...

03:34.509 --> 03:36.828
Uh, that's a different story
that I...

03:36.916 --> 03:39.406
I'm leaving.

03:39.677 --> 03:44.546
Woe to us!
Our beloved king is dead!

03:44.634 --> 03:48.014
Your widowed queen,
is she rich?

03:48.102 --> 03:49.671
Rich beyond belief.

03:49.759 --> 03:51.679
Her crown alone
is made out of

03:51.767 --> 03:54.398
diamond-encrusted
miniature stars.

03:54.486 --> 03:55.609
Good Lord!

03:55.697 --> 03:57.163
But all is lost.

03:57.266 --> 04:00.631
If she doesn't remarry
by sundown, her dynasty ends.

04:00.719 --> 04:02.710
And her crown
is destroyed.

04:02.798 --> 04:05.679
What? Well, does she fancy
pint-sized men?

04:05.767 --> 04:08.027
You know, a little of
the "smalls on talls."

04:08.132 --> 04:10.278
Yes, her
greatest weakness.

04:10.366 --> 04:13.257
And my greatest strength.
How do I do it?

04:13.345 --> 04:17.141
A little thing called
malnutrition.

04:18.877 --> 04:20.773
You weren't easy to find.

04:21.017 --> 04:24.960
Must run in the family,
Sheryl Goodspeed.

04:26.515 --> 04:28.125
My name is Todd H. Watson.

04:28.213 --> 04:32.958
I run this small power station,
the largest in the galaxy.

04:33.112 --> 04:35.726
Got it.
So it's small but huge.

04:35.814 --> 04:36.831
Typical male.

04:36.919 --> 04:39.726
Ooh, how does it feel
to be my captive?

04:39.814 --> 04:41.004
Am I your captive?

04:42.845 --> 04:45.187
You're chained,
aren't you?

04:50.230 --> 04:51.562
I was.

04:52.939 --> 04:54.989
The only reason why I let
your bounty hunters

04:55.077 --> 04:57.091
capture me was because
I got bored killing them,

04:57.179 --> 04:59.078
and I was curious
who kept sending them,

04:59.133 --> 05:01.960
and now that I know,
I'd like to know why.

05:02.067 --> 05:04.390
I'm looking for
your son Gary.

05:06.227 --> 05:09.000
All this work to ask me
where my kid is?

05:09.135 --> 05:10.820
Don't know, don't care.

05:10.976 --> 05:13.164
And now, since you tried
to kill me,

05:13.351 --> 05:14.820
I'm going to return
the favor.

05:14.923 --> 05:16.665
Ah! Oh! Ow!

05:16.847 --> 05:19.742
No!
By the time we're done,

05:19.962 --> 05:22.802
you're going to tell me
where your son is,

05:22.928 --> 05:24.731
whether you like it
or not.

05:28.431 --> 05:31.375
I should warn you,
Mrs. Goodspeed,

05:31.536 --> 05:34.054
it's going to get wild.

05:39.691 --> 05:42.351
Fox, Ash,
you fleece the populace.

05:42.439 --> 05:43.698
I'm going to marry the queen.

05:44.300 --> 05:46.532
It's my oldest con.

05:50.621 --> 05:52.450
Hm.

05:53.028 --> 05:56.013
Queen,
may I have the pl...

05:56.225 --> 05:57.882
Gah!

05:57.970 --> 05:59.662
Bango!

06:05.372 --> 06:09.750
Now, your Queeniness,
may I have this dance?

06:11.913 --> 06:13.448
So beautiful!

06:14.939 --> 06:15.939
Aah!

06:16.031 --> 06:18.390
Wow, no one has ever
called me that before.

06:18.478 --> 06:20.462
So do you want
to dance or not?

06:20.550 --> 06:21.981
Uh... guh.

06:22.216 --> 06:23.337
Ugh!

06:25.323 --> 06:27.238
Look at us,
two crazy kids!

06:27.325 --> 06:29.861
Back home, we don't have
wealth like this.

06:29.948 --> 06:31.929
Heck, we don't have
money at all!

06:32.054 --> 06:34.849
We exchange goods and services
for hugs and love.

06:34.937 --> 06:37.213
It's all I've ever known.

06:37.351 --> 06:40.872
That's so romantic,
you cute little raisin-boy.

06:40.959 --> 06:42.334
But sometimes I think...

06:42.789 --> 06:45.049
No, you're just going
to say it's crazy.

06:45.136 --> 06:47.707
No, no, go on.
Please.

06:47.794 --> 06:50.208
Sometimes I think maybe
I should experience

06:50.296 --> 06:52.482
an enormous amount
of money and riches,

06:52.570 --> 06:55.609
you know, just to see what
your mixed-up world is like.

06:59.858 --> 07:00.945
Oh, down again.

07:18.834 --> 07:20.343
I want in.

07:20.588 --> 07:23.255
This little Ventrexian wants
to bounty hunt

07:23.343 --> 07:24.466
with the Burner Tribe.

07:24.554 --> 07:25.712
I'll prove myself.

07:25.800 --> 07:28.436
Give me a name, any name,
and I'll track them down.

07:28.524 --> 07:29.539
All right.

07:29.895 --> 07:32.687
Oh, you don't think
I got the goods?

07:35.288 --> 07:36.515
Aah!

07:37.219 --> 07:39.412
And what makes you think
you can hunt?

07:41.687 --> 07:43.038
It's in my blood.

07:43.125 --> 07:44.764
Do I have an assignment
or not?

07:44.851 --> 07:46.132
Sure.

07:46.220 --> 07:50.482
You know, once you join us,
you're in for life, right?

07:50.822 --> 07:53.980
- Yeah.
- That is all of your days.

07:54.199 --> 07:55.948
Yeah, I know what
"for life" means.

07:56.036 --> 07:58.042
Some people think
that's hyperbole,

07:58.130 --> 08:00.615
so I like to
clarify up top.

08:01.474 --> 08:03.160
I got nowhere
else to go.

08:03.497 --> 08:05.105
Who should
we send him after?

08:05.193 --> 08:06.406
- Nails.
- The Truck.

08:06.493 --> 08:08.028
- Scar!
- Daniels!

08:08.115 --> 08:09.305
Nah.

08:09.392 --> 08:12.481
We go after the biggest bounty
on the market now.

08:14.265 --> 08:16.265
Gary Goodspeed.

08:17.227 --> 08:18.413
You in?

08:18.501 --> 08:19.519
Sure thing.

08:19.607 --> 08:21.638
Gonna be easy
murdering this guy

08:21.726 --> 08:24.905
that I have
no emotional connection to.

08:27.914 --> 08:31.944
Why do you cry,
my gorgeous... queen.

08:32.056 --> 08:33.476
Oh.

08:33.563 --> 08:34.943
Oops!

08:35.039 --> 08:36.976
Oh, silly me!

08:37.077 --> 08:39.421
That's all right.
It was an accident.

08:39.558 --> 08:40.956
You were saying?

08:41.044 --> 08:42.897
If I don't
marry by sunset,

08:42.985 --> 08:46.796
I lose everything the light
touches, including my crown.

08:46.884 --> 08:49.140
What if...
You marry me?

08:49.228 --> 08:50.476
Yes, yes, I accept.

08:55.981 --> 08:58.054
Men love when
I cough on them.

08:58.188 --> 09:00.448
So wonderfully slimy!

09:00.536 --> 09:02.331
Yay!

09:05.584 --> 09:07.632
Hey! Everyone,
we're looking for a kid.

09:07.720 --> 09:09.858
We were told he may have
come through here.

09:09.946 --> 09:12.640
Psst, that kid,
is he a Ventrexian?

09:12.728 --> 09:14.161
Because I've seen one.

09:14.257 --> 09:15.898
- You have?
- Yeah, yeah.

09:16.066 --> 09:19.077
But I won't tell you where
until you do something for me.

09:19.165 --> 09:20.769
What do you want
us to do?

09:20.864 --> 09:22.772
Here, take this
plasma knife

09:22.860 --> 09:24.093
and just stab
my hand with it.

09:24.181 --> 09:26.234
- Excuse me, what?
- Yeah, just a quick stab!

09:26.322 --> 09:27.409
Ugh!
Right in the old palm!

09:27.505 --> 09:28.749
Why do you want me
to do that?

09:28.837 --> 09:30.772
Never done it before.
Could be cool.

09:30.860 --> 09:32.568
I assure you
it will not be cool.

09:32.656 --> 09:34.242
Yeah, how do you know?
Have you done it before?

09:34.329 --> 09:35.708
- No!
- Well, okay then,

09:35.796 --> 09:38.040
that's the deal.
No stab, no gab.

09:38.168 --> 09:40.674
You drive a weird bargain,
shadow friend.

09:40.762 --> 09:42.007
- Ha!
- Aaah!

09:42.095 --> 09:44.907
You bastard!
That's incredibly painful!

09:44.995 --> 09:46.481
All right.
Now tell us the information.

09:46.569 --> 09:47.643
All right!

09:47.731 --> 09:49.690
But if you want
this information,

09:49.863 --> 09:52.176
you'll have to stab
my other hand.

09:55.120 --> 09:57.309
Something in your
memories will lead me

09:57.397 --> 10:00.284
to my good friend Gary.

10:03.770 --> 10:06.237
Oh, this looks interesting.

10:06.409 --> 10:09.120
Your mission is to engage
the agent of the Infinity Guard.

10:09.261 --> 10:11.378
Use your powers of
subterfuge and seduction

10:11.466 --> 10:13.885
to gain his trust and learn
what they are building.

10:13.973 --> 10:15.718
We need those plans.

10:15.809 --> 10:17.068
What's the target's name?

10:17.156 --> 10:18.519
His name...

10:18.734 --> 10:20.563
is John Goodspeed.

10:22.618 --> 10:24.292
<i>♪ I can't see anyone but you ♪</i>

10:24.380 --> 10:26.589
Let me guess.
Infinity Guard.

10:26.677 --> 10:27.867
What gives me away?

10:27.955 --> 10:28.972
The jawline.

10:29.060 --> 10:30.458
Or the uniform.

10:30.546 --> 10:32.633
No, it's the jawline.

10:32.721 --> 10:33.995
So why would a woman
like you

10:34.083 --> 10:36.171
be all by herself
on a Friday night?

10:36.259 --> 10:37.948
Waiting for
the right company.

10:38.036 --> 10:40.952
Stop wasting my time!

10:41.040 --> 10:43.181
Take me to Gary!

10:46.142 --> 10:48.333
Where do you think
you're taking me?

10:48.421 --> 10:49.995
It's a surprise.

10:52.718 --> 10:54.922
This is the only place
in the galaxy where you can see

10:55.010 --> 10:57.774
the suns rising
and setting at the same time.

10:57.878 --> 10:59.672
There's nowhere I'd rather
spend the morning

10:59.760 --> 11:01.985
slash late afternoon
slash middle of the night

11:02.072 --> 11:03.332
with than you.

11:03.419 --> 11:05.479
So good morning
and good night

11:05.567 --> 11:07.724
and happy New Year.

11:07.933 --> 11:09.581
Did I leave
anything out?

11:10.303 --> 11:11.862
The kiss.

11:13.381 --> 11:15.157
I could have tortured
her, but no,

11:15.292 --> 11:17.000
I did the memory
injection.

11:17.087 --> 11:19.807
Now I'm sitting in the middle
of a freaking rom-com!

11:21.493 --> 11:24.483
Sorry, I need
to take this.

11:24.880 --> 11:26.001
What?!

11:26.109 --> 11:27.790
You've been on this
mission for six months.

11:27.878 --> 11:29.427
If you don't gain intel soon,

11:29.514 --> 11:31.325
you will be pulled
from this assignment.

11:31.412 --> 11:33.034
Trust me, I'm on it.

11:33.122 --> 11:34.347
Are you okay?

11:34.442 --> 11:36.440
Actually...

11:37.867 --> 11:40.248
I'm pregnant.

11:42.099 --> 11:44.393
And along comes Gary.

11:48.260 --> 11:53.661
Would you please,
just please tell me

11:53.764 --> 11:55.679
where the freaking
kid is?

11:55.767 --> 11:57.060
Okay, okay!

11:57.148 --> 11:59.089
People who got
no place to go

11:59.200 --> 12:01.149
hook up with
the Burner Tribe.

12:01.269 --> 12:03.424
Thank you!
And where are they?

12:03.512 --> 12:04.512
I'll tell you

12:04.604 --> 12:06.870
right after you
stab me in the neck.

12:06.958 --> 12:08.641
Come on, do it.

12:08.729 --> 12:10.122
Please no. I'd do it for you.

12:10.209 --> 12:11.883
- Come on!
- You will die!

12:11.970 --> 12:13.160
- Just a little stab.
- No!

12:13.247 --> 12:14.555
- Come on.
- Oh, my gosh.

12:14.643 --> 12:15.853
- Please!
- You're going to die!

12:15.940 --> 12:17.594
- Do it!
- Do you understand that?

12:17.682 --> 12:19.985
Stop clutching your pearls,
you drama queen.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.446
- Just do it!
- Gary, please.

12:22.534 --> 12:24.171
Just stab him
in the neck already.

12:24.258 --> 12:26.138
Okay, yeah.
I'm the crazy one here.

12:26.225 --> 12:27.854
All right.
Fine.

12:29.295 --> 12:32.003
Aaah! Are you trying
to kill me?!

12:32.137 --> 12:34.052
Oh, it's a gusher.
Oh, my God.

12:34.140 --> 12:35.569
It's just falling
in that guy's drink.

12:35.657 --> 12:36.710
Right, it's just...

12:36.798 --> 12:39.403
it's literally shooting
directly in that guy's...

12:39.526 --> 12:41.495
Oh, and he just...
Oh, he just drank it.

12:41.583 --> 12:42.807
Whoa! Oh!

12:42.895 --> 12:45.401
There's a port right
on the edge of this city.

12:47.733 --> 12:49.612
And he's dead.

12:49.732 --> 12:51.250
Let's go!

12:52.483 --> 12:54.985
What makes you sure Little Cato
will come back with us?

12:55.073 --> 12:56.462
Good question.
He'll see how much we

12:56.549 --> 12:58.339
went through to get him,
and he'll come back.

12:58.427 --> 13:00.010
- Impressed?
- I am, Gary,

13:00.098 --> 13:02.086
but I'm programmed
to be impressed by you.

13:02.174 --> 13:03.586
- Shut up, KVN.
- Gary,

13:03.674 --> 13:05.096
when you
lost your dad,

13:05.206 --> 13:07.799
what was the one thing
you wanted more than anything?

13:08.049 --> 13:09.602
- Besides a cookie.
- Dang!

13:09.690 --> 13:11.159
I was going
to say cookies.

13:11.364 --> 13:13.258
Well, I guess
a normal life.

13:13.346 --> 13:14.376
Exactly.

13:14.464 --> 13:16.370
After what went down
with Avocato,

13:16.503 --> 13:19.518
to get him to come back,
you're going to have to step up.

13:20.651 --> 13:22.229
I'm already doing
the most I can.

13:22.384 --> 13:24.180
Really? Mm.

13:24.268 --> 13:26.378
Well, then maybe
we should stop looking.

13:32.443 --> 13:33.909
Ugh.

13:34.042 --> 13:36.174
Considering they had a whole,
like, seven minutes

13:36.261 --> 13:39.399
to plan this thing,
it's, uh, not too shabby.

13:39.487 --> 13:40.899
And I hear at weddings

13:40.987 --> 13:43.508
there's a whole hour
of just appe-teasers!

13:43.596 --> 13:44.939
Ooh, little pies.

13:45.027 --> 13:47.711
You think you're big pies,
but you're not!

13:47.799 --> 13:49.876
There he is, the most
gorgeous man

13:49.964 --> 13:51.860
I've ever whirled
in my tentacles!

13:51.948 --> 13:53.579
Do you,
the Prince of Rescue,

13:53.667 --> 13:56.479
promise to worship,
obey, and service the queen?

13:56.694 --> 13:58.160
I do.

13:58.263 --> 14:01.924
And, Queen, are you cool
with this rando?

14:02.012 --> 14:03.016
Sure.

14:03.104 --> 14:05.981
You may slap the groom
across his honey cheeks.

14:06.076 --> 14:07.821
- Oh!
- Go nuts.

14:07.909 --> 14:09.065
He's your
property now.

14:09.153 --> 14:10.205
Wa-bl-bl-bl-bl.

14:10.293 --> 14:13.018
Come here!
Ew.

14:13.418 --> 14:15.731
Oh, good God!

14:17.998 --> 14:19.724
Oh.

14:19.998 --> 14:21.432
Oh!

14:23.136 --> 14:24.154
Aah!

14:24.381 --> 14:25.932
I've got it!
I've got it!

14:28.855 --> 14:31.806
Ooh-hoo-hoo,
the crown is mine!

14:31.902 --> 14:33.437
Di-di-di-da-doo,
do-dah...

14:33.524 --> 14:35.026
Oh, hey, Clarence!
Nice crown!

14:35.114 --> 14:36.127
I couldn't agree more.

14:36.215 --> 14:37.229
Aah! Whoa!

14:37.317 --> 14:40.090
You're going to break
your favorite small!

14:41.332 --> 14:44.370
Oh, even that crown isn't worth
irreparable damage

14:44.458 --> 14:45.924
to my poor wonder worm.

14:46.012 --> 14:47.410
There's no escape!

14:47.498 --> 14:49.965
I must take my poison capsule.

14:50.470 --> 14:51.384
Ah..

14:51.472 --> 14:52.495
Ooh, naughty.

14:52.583 --> 14:55.096
Why didn't you tell me
you had recreationals?

14:56.317 --> 14:57.893
Aaah!

14:57.981 --> 14:59.464
Aah!

15:00.221 --> 15:01.416
Ugh, dad!

15:01.504 --> 15:02.591
Ugh!

15:02.679 --> 15:03.737
Mommy?

15:03.825 --> 15:05.089
Oh, step-mommy!

15:05.177 --> 15:07.417
The way I see it,
we have 30 seconds

15:07.505 --> 15:09.074
before Fox loses it
completely!

15:09.162 --> 15:11.214
Mama!

15:13.464 --> 15:15.777
Why must you damage
property every time

15:15.865 --> 15:17.690
I accidentally poison
a stepmother?

15:17.778 --> 15:20.988
Quickly, grab the crown
and everything of value.

15:21.747 --> 15:24.299
Are you okay?

15:24.439 --> 15:27.995
Speak words to my face
if you are okay.

15:28.192 --> 15:30.635
I just fell and hit my head,

15:30.754 --> 15:32.010
and I might be dying.

15:32.098 --> 15:34.932
Dying?!
We are coming in now!

15:35.101 --> 15:36.878
What the actual
hell, Fox?

15:36.966 --> 15:38.440
I'm trying
to save you, Papa.

15:38.528 --> 15:40.917
Yeah, if you don't like
how we pull this grift,

15:41.005 --> 15:42.433
then we don't have
to help you at all!

15:42.520 --> 15:44.336
No, no, no, kids, I...
I'm sorry.

15:44.424 --> 15:46.948
From now on, we do things
like a normal family.

15:47.036 --> 15:48.399
Do you mean that Papa?

15:48.487 --> 15:51.159
I do. Just right after you
hide me in the queen.

15:51.247 --> 15:52.276
- Where?
- Say what now?

15:53.469 --> 15:54.867
Just pick a hole and push!

15:54.955 --> 15:57.457
Then after the funeral,
we'll do a McBerry Jerry.

15:57.545 --> 15:58.700
Dig you up, cut you out,

15:58.788 --> 16:00.266
rinse you down,
and we're home free!

16:00.354 --> 16:01.394
Has that ever worked?

16:01.482 --> 16:03.674
Ninth time's
the charm.

16:04.511 --> 16:06.385
Ugh.

16:06.473 --> 16:08.041
Push me in!

16:09.429 --> 16:12.206
Oh, no!
The queen is dead!

16:12.308 --> 16:14.453
- I'm fine!
- Okay.

16:14.541 --> 16:15.597
All right.
She's not dead.

16:15.685 --> 16:17.166
There goes
the McBerry Jerry.

16:17.254 --> 16:18.893
The queen lives!

16:18.981 --> 16:20.517
Oh, it's a miracle!

16:20.605 --> 16:21.933
For real, people.

16:22.021 --> 16:23.823
I just have
a bit of bloat.

16:23.911 --> 16:25.980
Oh, I feel so nauseous. Oh!

16:26.068 --> 16:28.018
Queen, there's a life
inside of you.

16:28.137 --> 16:29.500
It is
a double miracle!

16:29.686 --> 16:31.934
One, two! You're supposed to be dead.

16:32.022 --> 16:33.894
What?
I'm pregnant?

16:34.732 --> 16:36.509
Yay.

16:36.597 --> 16:40.686
King Clarence
gave me a baby-y-y-y-y.

16:40.774 --> 16:43.201
- I can't wait to nurse him.
- No!

16:43.289 --> 16:46.447
I think your prince
is ready to be born!

16:46.803 --> 16:49.652
Now, this is the right
number of stairs.

16:51.020 --> 16:52.707
Little Cato!

16:54.150 --> 16:55.236
Go away.

16:55.347 --> 16:56.731
Hey, don't do that.

16:56.837 --> 16:58.400
Not after what
we've been through.

16:58.496 --> 17:00.908
- I said, "Go away!"
- I can't believe my eyes.

17:01.158 --> 17:03.601
I thought we were sending you
on a suicide mission,

17:03.711 --> 17:05.349
but you actually
found him.

17:05.453 --> 17:06.712
Wait, what?

17:06.820 --> 17:07.892
Oh!

17:07.980 --> 17:09.480
Little Cato,
what's going on?

17:09.568 --> 17:12.189
There's a price
on your head, Gary!

17:15.277 --> 17:16.478
There is?

17:16.566 --> 17:19.329
Well, look, there's some stuff
I want to talk about.

17:19.416 --> 17:21.587
- Now?!
- I've been doing some thinking!

17:21.675 --> 17:23.900
I know you've been dealt
a bad hand,

17:23.988 --> 17:26.243
and you keep getting
dealt bad hands.

17:26.332 --> 17:27.728
I know I have.

17:28.550 --> 17:30.398
Yeah, I'm not talking to you,
but all right.

17:30.486 --> 17:31.884
Hey, would you please...

17:32.059 --> 17:35.804
Sometimes our heart goes all-in,
and we get wiped out.

17:35.891 --> 17:37.115
Preach, brother.

17:44.674 --> 17:46.278
But you got to stick it out.

17:46.395 --> 17:48.423
The only way out is through.

17:48.731 --> 17:51.699
We can still make this right.

17:51.912 --> 17:53.788
What are you
talking about?

17:59.410 --> 18:02.672
Just... I mean...
J-just stay!

18:02.993 --> 18:05.121
What do you say I...
I, uh...

18:05.348 --> 18:06.503
I adopt you?

18:06.590 --> 18:08.229
What?
What?

18:08.316 --> 18:10.010
- Chookity!
- Cawww!

18:10.098 --> 18:12.439
I mean only if you want, like,
a, you know, rental dad

18:12.527 --> 18:15.965
until we get your actual dad
back, or like a vice dad.

18:16.324 --> 18:17.840
You want
to be my dad?

18:18.154 --> 18:19.449
Go to him.

18:20.018 --> 18:21.480
Be loved.

18:21.895 --> 18:23.581
I mean... I mean, you...
You don't have to change

18:23.668 --> 18:25.678
your name
to Little Goodspeed or any...

18:27.577 --> 18:29.082
You see that, guys?

18:29.449 --> 18:34.174
First there was no family,
and then there was one, like us.

18:34.627 --> 18:36.257
That's the power
of magic.

18:36.424 --> 18:38.502
Cawww!

18:38.725 --> 18:40.127
Mmm.

18:42.350 --> 18:44.603
Excuse me, but...
Yeah, can I just...

18:44.713 --> 18:45.861
Yo.

18:45.949 --> 18:48.296
Ooh, that's nice.

18:51.835 --> 18:53.128
I'll be good.

18:53.458 --> 18:54.648
I'll change.

18:54.845 --> 18:56.634
Just get me out of here!

18:56.744 --> 18:57.805
Oh!

18:57.893 --> 18:59.377
Oh, yes!

18:59.476 --> 19:00.995
Thank you.

19:03.134 --> 19:04.565
Ooh, look at you.

19:04.653 --> 19:07.062
He looks more like me than
his father, don't you think?

19:07.151 --> 19:08.781
Huh?

19:08.869 --> 19:09.913
Aah!

19:10.033 --> 19:11.038
Aah!

19:11.126 --> 19:12.663
Oh, he's brought
treasures with him!

19:12.751 --> 19:15.115
It is a triple miracle!

19:15.202 --> 19:16.392
One, two, three!

19:16.487 --> 19:19.510
Uh, goo-goo,
gah-gah.

19:19.890 --> 19:21.533
Fox, Ash, run!

19:21.621 --> 19:23.191
He speaks and runs.

19:23.279 --> 19:24.922
A quadruple miracle!

19:25.010 --> 19:26.844
One, two, three, four!

19:30.732 --> 19:32.625
Grab hold.

19:33.755 --> 19:34.876
My crown!

19:35.401 --> 19:37.726
I'll always love you!

19:39.966 --> 19:42.289
Wait,
where's my crown?

19:42.377 --> 19:46.226
Dang it, I have lost track
of all the miracles.

19:48.412 --> 19:51.155
So, agent, what is
John Goodspeed building?

19:51.243 --> 19:52.351
Something big.

19:56.018 --> 19:58.416
Hey, shh!
Mommy's working.

19:58.597 --> 20:00.703
He's building
an anti-matter bomb.

20:04.666 --> 20:06.087
You were using me?

20:06.175 --> 20:07.848
- What?
- N-no.

20:08.086 --> 20:12.859
Well, I mean, at first,
but, look,

20:12.961 --> 20:14.761
I never expected
to fall in love.

20:14.848 --> 20:16.490
What kind of a monster
has a child

20:16.578 --> 20:18.696
with someone
just to steal some plans?

20:18.783 --> 20:19.891
I didn't! I...

20:21.292 --> 20:23.639
- Shut up!
- Get out!

20:30.290 --> 20:32.781
I wish you
were never born.

20:34.592 --> 20:36.062
Fun!

20:38.095 --> 20:40.008
Hello, Sheryl.

20:41.078 --> 20:43.269
Looks like we got off
on the wrong foot.

20:43.411 --> 20:47.777
I didn't realize you had such
a strong opinion about your son.

20:47.865 --> 20:50.109
That's something we have
in common.

20:51.879 --> 20:54.609
What if, just throwing
this out there,

20:54.697 --> 20:56.167
you help me find Gary,

20:56.268 --> 20:59.250
and in return
I did something for you?

20:59.554 --> 21:01.607
Maybe there is something.

21:01.749 --> 21:04.646
I'm look for
dimensional keys.

21:04.734 --> 21:06.320
Never heard of them,

21:06.472 --> 21:09.544
but you've got
yourself a deal.

21:10.305 --> 21:16.531
