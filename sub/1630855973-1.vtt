WEBVTT

01:48.071 --> 01:49.732
Forward!

01:51.272 --> 01:54.605
Go!

03:35.871 --> 03:38.038
Suetonius Paulinus,

03:38.038 --> 03:42.746
Commander of the 14th Gemina
and the 20th Valeria Victrix!

03:51.018 --> 03:54.197
As Praefectus Castrorum
in charge,

03:54.197 --> 03:55.957
what did you have your men do?

03:55.957 --> 04:00.093
I advanced in triplex formation,
cohorts One to Four.

04:00.093 --> 04:03.437
Three and Five in support.
Auxiliary cavalry on flank.

04:04.097 --> 04:05.802
And...

04:05.802 --> 04:07.474
What did these cult leaders
of Mona do

04:07.474 --> 04:10.070
when they beheld
your invasion forces?

04:10.070 --> 04:12.105
Chanting as if
in some sort of trance.

04:12.105 --> 04:16.483
Even when facing
the 14th Gemina Legion,

04:16.483 --> 04:20.916
these experienced Celt
fighting men... kneeled?

04:22.115 --> 04:24.590
Trusting that
their religious leaders

04:24.590 --> 04:27.725
would offer them salvation
against your sword.

04:27.725 --> 04:30.431
Yes. It appears that way, Dominus.

04:31.300 --> 04:32.763
You slaughtered them?

04:33.698 --> 04:36.470
As is my duty to Rome.

04:36.470 --> 04:40.738
The Celt Cucullus believe
in the Furies,

04:40.738 --> 04:43.103
women warriors that symbolize
vengeance and rebirth.

04:43.103 --> 04:45.281
They believe that
a woman warrior

04:45.281 --> 04:46.810
will somehow be their salvation

04:46.810 --> 04:49.714
and end the Roman occupation
of Britannia.

04:49.714 --> 04:55.148
They must not...
find their savior.

04:55.148 --> 04:57.293
As Augustus,
I‘ve issued a strict decree,

04:57.293 --> 05:00.230
forbidding women from holding
a position of influence,

05:00.230 --> 05:02.826
martial, judicial, or otherwise.

05:02.826 --> 05:06.269
We don‘t need another woman
like my mother.

05:08.601 --> 05:10.669
This decree must
be upheld verbatim.

05:10.669 --> 05:13.507
And under threat
of severe punishment.

05:13.507 --> 05:17.940
Especially in the tribes
of the island Britannia.

05:19.172 --> 05:20.712
Your Majesty.

07:24.264 --> 07:26.442
- Uh!

07:26.442 --> 07:29.005
You scared me.

07:29.005 --> 07:33.207
So help me, I love you more
with each day that passes.

07:35.583 --> 07:37.915
I know you have made me
the luckiest man alive.

07:40.082 --> 07:44.394
And you, my king,

07:44.394 --> 07:48.827
have made me the proudest
mother, wife, and queen.

07:51.731 --> 07:53.799
Let me take you, right now.

07:53.799 --> 07:56.329
- Like old times.

07:56.329 --> 07:57.770
Mind’s groggy...

07:59.442 --> 08:00.905
Neither asleep...

08:01.774 --> 08:03.039
nor awake.

08:03.039 --> 08:05.745
Mmm... You‘re definitely awake.

08:09.276 --> 08:10.816
Whatever we do this morning,

08:10.816 --> 08:14.457
my noble, brave,
and oh-so-worthy

08:14.457 --> 08:16.184
king of the Iceni,

08:16.184 --> 08:17.988
we do it for
an audience of, uh,

08:17.988 --> 08:21.794
several servants...

08:21.794 --> 08:23.928
A half dozen guards, and...

08:24.830 --> 08:26.997
Two curious little girls.

08:28.570 --> 08:30.473
They‘re awake, aren‘t they?

08:30.473 --> 08:32.068
- Yeah.

08:35.907 --> 08:37.172
Good day my king.

08:37.172 --> 08:38.547
May I join you
for breakfast?

08:38.547 --> 08:41.143
You and the entire fort,
dear Ciaran!

08:41.143 --> 08:43.343
C‘mon. Make yourself at home.

08:43.343 --> 08:45.213
I traveled through the night

08:45.213 --> 08:46.885
And I’m hungry.

08:46.885 --> 08:48.722
Hungry. He’s hungry!

08:48.722 --> 08:50.284
I’m hungry!

08:51.824 --> 08:54.629
I’m gonna eat your bones!
Arrrgh!

08:57.698 --> 08:59.568
How goes it in Camulos?

08:59.568 --> 09:01.328
We welcomed a new procurator.

09:02.164 --> 09:04.100
Catus Decianus.

09:05.068 --> 09:06.399
Should I be concerned?

09:06.399 --> 09:07.906
He‘s a Roman.

09:07.906 --> 09:10.073
Spoiled by Africa,
and he hates it here.

09:10.073 --> 09:12.812
He’ll transfer home at the
first sign of insurrection.

09:12.812 --> 09:13.879
Let’s hope.

09:17.245 --> 09:19.016
Sorry, Ciaran.

09:19.016 --> 09:22.316
My offspring have the
savage blood of the Ancients

09:22.316 --> 09:25.319
running through their veins.

09:25.319 --> 09:26.628
Like their mother.

09:26.628 --> 09:28.091
Your "offspring"...

09:28.091 --> 09:29.499
is the daughter of a king.

09:29.499 --> 09:32.865
A very intelligent and
quick-witted daughter,

09:32.865 --> 09:35.934
who will serve as a great
queen one day.

09:40.136 --> 09:41.544
Mornin’.

09:41.544 --> 09:43.271
Ah! Latin study, girls!

09:43.271 --> 09:45.141
Good morning, girls.
Are we ready for class?

09:45.141 --> 09:46.846
Yes... Hey!

09:50.047 --> 09:52.379
Little savages.

09:52.379 --> 09:55.118
We earn money to pay
a Roman tutor

09:55.118 --> 09:57.791
to teach our daughters
the language of our occupier,

09:57.791 --> 10:01.960
so they might understand
how to navigate a future...

10:03.423 --> 10:04.798
A future where
their father’s rule

10:04.798 --> 10:06.998
will be a distant memory
of an old colony.

10:07.933 --> 10:09.671
Well, we must change,

10:09.671 --> 10:12.432
if we don’t want to be
left alone in the cold like...

10:12.432 --> 10:14.335
Barbarian Brigantes.

10:14.335 --> 10:17.041
Well, I love my barbarian wife.

10:19.912 --> 10:22.277
You have king-like things
to discuss with brave Ciaran,

10:22.277 --> 10:25.016
my love, and I have
a cosmetics session.

10:25.016 --> 10:27.986
And then I’m taking
the girls to the market.

10:27.986 --> 10:29.790
We’ll come find you.

10:29.790 --> 10:31.154
Promise me you always will.

10:31.924 --> 10:33.024
I promise.

10:35.059 --> 10:36.489
Sit down. Come on.

10:36.489 --> 10:38.766
Eat this. No waste in here.

10:45.674 --> 10:48.336
We import
fashionable cosmetics

10:48.336 --> 10:52.010
from Germania, Gaul,
and fabled Serica.

10:53.308 --> 10:55.409
Some are so expensive and rare,

10:55.409 --> 10:59.281
the Emperor himself chokes when
he pays for his wife’s bill.

11:08.389 --> 11:13.669
Excess hair is not considered
fashionable at all this season.

11:18.432 --> 11:20.005
Rouge for the cheeks,

11:20.005 --> 11:22.535
red ocher, imported from Belgium

11:22.535 --> 11:26.374
and ground against mortar stone
into the finest powder.

11:28.981 --> 11:31.214
The color of your tunic
is so beautiful.

11:31.214 --> 11:32.545
Where did you find it?

11:32.545 --> 11:33.722
From the Oppida,

11:33.722 --> 11:35.625
outside of Roman security lines.

11:36.516 --> 11:37.792
It was cheap there.

11:41.763 --> 11:43.127
Should we go?

11:58.846 --> 12:00.276
Oh, excuse me.

12:00.276 --> 12:02.311
We’re looking
for the Oppida.

12:02.311 --> 12:03.576
Down there.

12:03.576 --> 12:04.753
Thank you.

12:21.363 --> 12:22.562
What?

12:22.562 --> 12:24.267
What’s the matter with you?

12:24.267 --> 12:25.675
We should not go there.

12:25.675 --> 12:27.710
This is not a place for you.

12:27.710 --> 12:28.744
We’re safe,

12:28.744 --> 12:30.471
the Romans are everywhere!

12:30.471 --> 12:32.440
Look what they do to thieves.

12:32.440 --> 12:34.651
These are not criminals,
they’re Christians.

12:35.377 --> 12:36.543
Oh.

12:36.543 --> 12:38.248
Christians don’t mix well

12:38.248 --> 12:40.547
with other religions,
so the Romans crucify them.

12:41.449 --> 12:43.616
We should go back.

12:43.616 --> 12:45.321
I’ll buy a bolt
of that material,

12:45.321 --> 12:47.488
then we can hurry back.
All right?

12:48.192 --> 12:49.292
Come on.

13:05.308 --> 13:07.277
Ah, yes.
What other colors do you have?

13:10.412 --> 13:12.986
Nodens,
god of dogs and hunting,

13:12.986 --> 13:14.823
forbidden
by Emperor Claudius.

13:14.823 --> 13:17.925
one
of the divine personifications

13:17.925 --> 13:19.223
in the Imperial Cult.

13:21.555 --> 13:23.293
The gods only granted man

13:23.293 --> 13:25.966
the gifts of intelligence,
virtue, and fidelity.

13:25.966 --> 13:27.495
Some fresh fruit?

13:27.495 --> 13:29.266
If the Imperial Cult
was so virtuous,

13:29.266 --> 13:30.773
why did they murder
all the Druids?

13:30.773 --> 13:32.874
Hey!
Change the subject please.

13:37.604 --> 13:39.507
Look,
Trinovante warriors.

14:01.562 --> 14:03.696
Boudica.

14:06.171 --> 14:07.271
Stop that talk!

14:10.340 --> 14:11.605
This is Boudica.

14:20.284 --> 14:21.857
Why are they kneeling?

14:21.857 --> 14:23.716
And what does Boudica mean?

14:23.716 --> 14:25.322
She was a Trinovante queen.

14:25.993 --> 14:27.654
Mother’s an Iceni queen?

14:27.654 --> 14:28.897
Your mother’s a Trinovante

14:28.897 --> 14:30.800
who became an Iceni queen.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.802
To these people,
that marks her

14:32.802 --> 14:34.463
more powerful than
the Roman Emperor.

14:35.563 --> 14:37.136
She’s like a god to them!

14:39.534 --> 14:42.207
Did your slave just speak ill
of the Emperor?

14:43.571 --> 14:45.111
She meant nothing by it.

14:45.111 --> 14:47.740
She’s a servant,
not a slave.

14:47.740 --> 14:50.952
Are you something special
to these joke barbarians?

14:50.952 --> 14:54.054
Vagrants who get fat
on Roman tributes.

14:54.054 --> 14:56.485
It appears you know
more than I, sir.

14:56.485 --> 14:58.421
I don’t know who they are.

14:58.421 --> 15:00.192
Come along, children.

15:00.192 --> 15:02.095
Your slave made
a disparaging remark

15:02.095 --> 15:03.558
about the Emperor.

15:03.558 --> 15:04.691
I’m sorry.

15:04.691 --> 15:06.462
A queen can afford some wine.

15:07.034 --> 15:09.465
Or the Roman auxiliary

15:09.465 --> 15:12.039
can hear about your slave’s
rebellious nature.

15:12.039 --> 15:14.239
You’ve really gone too far now!

15:14.239 --> 15:15.878
We have to find your father!

15:15.878 --> 15:18.705
You’re not going anywhere!
Find a legionarius!

15:23.820 --> 15:24.986
Aaargh!

15:42.465 --> 15:43.565
Go!

15:50.638 --> 15:52.673
Do you want
to know what I did today?

15:53.608 --> 15:56.853
I stood in front of
a room full of centurions

15:56.853 --> 15:59.185
and had to swear that my wife

15:59.889 --> 16:03.453
was a civil and gentle soul.

16:03.453 --> 16:04.894
A wonderful mother,

16:04.894 --> 16:08.590
who just simply loves to weave.

16:08.590 --> 16:12.759
I said and did
nothing to provoke them.

16:12.759 --> 16:13.826
I promise.

16:18.974 --> 16:21.768
I negotiated
and bargained more today,

16:21.768 --> 16:24.177
and with more passion,
than I’ve had to do in years.

16:26.608 --> 16:28.676
It was really quite thrilling.

16:28.676 --> 16:29.985
However...

16:31.052 --> 16:32.515
I do not wish to do it again,

16:32.515 --> 16:34.517
so we will send
servants into town

16:34.517 --> 16:36.123
next time you want
something special.

16:36.123 --> 16:38.257
Like a blue robe.

16:39.423 --> 16:41.260
At least for the
next year or so.

16:45.264 --> 16:47.200
Tell me, what does it mean?

16:47.860 --> 16:49.268
Boudica...

16:49.268 --> 16:50.500
Mm-hm?

16:50.500 --> 16:52.139
She was a Trinovante legend

16:52.139 --> 16:53.866
before the time
of the Druids.

16:53.866 --> 16:55.340
A fierce goddess.

16:55.340 --> 16:58.343
A proud warrior people
that were too...

16:59.377 --> 17:01.214
stubborn to negotiate.

17:01.214 --> 17:04.712
And some believe
she will come again,

17:04.712 --> 17:06.450
to free us from the Romans.

17:06.450 --> 17:07.550
Why me?

17:11.389 --> 17:13.061
My love.

17:13.061 --> 17:16.625
You and I were married
when we were young.

17:17.560 --> 17:19.298
You have a proud lineage.

17:21.971 --> 17:23.599
There’s barbarian blood

17:24.798 --> 17:26.008
that drives your heart,

17:27.207 --> 17:29.044
and they can see that.

17:29.044 --> 17:31.277
It’s impossible to hide
it from those people.

17:33.180 --> 17:34.874
Because they look at you
and they see

17:34.874 --> 17:36.744
what you have
achieved with your life.

17:36.744 --> 17:37.987
It incites them.

17:39.054 --> 17:40.418
Fills them full of hope.

17:40.418 --> 17:42.123
Is that a bad thing?

17:45.192 --> 17:47.997
It might scare the Romans
is all that I am saying.

17:47.997 --> 17:52.925
So I wish for you to stay here
and avoid town and barbarians,

17:52.925 --> 17:54.894
at least for a few weeks.

17:55.862 --> 17:57.039
Of course.

17:57.039 --> 17:59.437
Of course.

18:01.241 --> 18:03.738
You’re gonna have
to keep me prisoner.

18:03.738 --> 18:04.838
Mmm.

18:05.938 --> 18:07.940
Ugh! Savages!

18:09.183 --> 18:10.811
You monsters! Aah!

18:10.811 --> 18:12.846
Don’t kill me!
Ha ha ha!

18:14.353 --> 18:16.421
Where’s the honey mead
you promised me, then?

18:17.884 --> 18:19.391
Then you wanted
to wash away the taste

18:19.391 --> 18:21.591
of that shitty Roman wine
you’ve been drinking?

18:21.591 --> 18:23.626
If it gets me drunk,
I’ll drink it.

18:25.265 --> 18:29.203
So, finally, I’ve found my three
most fierce warriors!

18:29.203 --> 18:32.107
How are you boys
intimidated by our skill?

18:32.800 --> 18:33.933
Ugh!

18:34.901 --> 18:36.573
Get him!

18:36.573 --> 18:38.311
Oh, gotcha!

18:38.311 --> 18:41.908
Raargh, that’s what you get
for fighting a king!

18:43.019 --> 18:45.450
I’ll be back
at the Crannog, my liege.

18:45.450 --> 18:47.980
You can take my wild daughters
with you.

18:49.256 --> 18:51.819
- I want to speak with my queen.
- This way.

18:56.164 --> 18:57.825
What’s the matter with him?

18:57.825 --> 19:00.267
When a man fights in a war

19:00.267 --> 19:02.434
and loses his family,
his home.

19:02.434 --> 19:03.699
Ends up with nothing...

19:03.699 --> 19:06.801
Laughter and the sword
cease to go hand in hand.

19:06.801 --> 19:09.903
should’ve seen

19:09.903 --> 19:12.345
the way that woman
used her sword.

19:12.345 --> 19:14.314
She was...
she was so impressive.

19:14.314 --> 19:15.678
She attacked...

19:16.976 --> 19:19.583
...without hesitation.

19:22.619 --> 19:24.522
I’m not sure I want my daughters

19:24.522 --> 19:26.491
to be Trinovante Brigante, though.

19:27.690 --> 19:30.330
Fighting. Never trusting anyone.

19:31.694 --> 19:33.795
None of them
live very long lives.

19:35.467 --> 19:38.239
To be able
to defend oneself...

19:38.800 --> 19:39.900
Hm!

19:39.900 --> 19:42.870
Cannot be a bad thing.

19:43.475 --> 19:44.575
You...

19:44.575 --> 19:47.908
You clearly have
Trinovante blood in your veins.

19:49.217 --> 19:51.450
Use that ferocity
in a thoughtful way.

19:53.188 --> 19:54.585
Not in a bloodthirsty one.

19:54.585 --> 19:56.488
Mm-hmm.

19:56.488 --> 19:58.457
Use it to be the
best queen possible.

20:00.558 --> 20:01.988
Ha!

20:05.024 --> 20:06.234
Come get me!

20:06.234 --> 20:08.500
If you want to be a warrior

20:08.500 --> 20:09.798
a Trinovante warrior.

20:10.832 --> 20:12.966
- Mmm.

20:12.966 --> 20:14.066
Then let’s go home.

20:14.836 --> 20:16.673
Because I have something
to give you.

20:27.013 --> 20:29.125
It’s not really a gift from me.

20:30.885 --> 20:32.920
It’s part of the dowry
given by your father,

20:32.920 --> 20:35.230
when I asked for
your hand in marriage.

20:35.230 --> 20:37.958
At the time I didn’t really
know what to do with it,

20:37.958 --> 20:40.301
but recent events
have proven...

20:40.301 --> 20:43.634
It may well be possible
to leave your origins behind

20:45.504 --> 20:47.638
but I think your origins
will never leave you.

20:47.638 --> 20:49.035
Hmm.

20:49.035 --> 20:50.212
What is it, father?

20:54.007 --> 20:56.779
Protected for centuries
by the ancient Druids,

20:57.714 --> 20:59.419
the Queen of the Furies...

21:00.387 --> 21:01.553
Boudica.

21:09.022 --> 21:13.268
Thank you, Father.
My king.

21:14.632 --> 21:16.469
It is said that
the ancient smiths

21:16.469 --> 21:19.175
used forgotten magic
from the mountain mists

21:19.175 --> 21:21.100
to forge blades like this.

21:21.100 --> 21:22.376
If you look closely,

21:23.135 --> 21:24.642
you’ll see how
the color changes

21:24.642 --> 21:25.940
with the flickering fire.

21:25.940 --> 21:28.580
As if the God spell
of the Earth itself

21:28.580 --> 21:30.142
is woven
within its bronze.

21:48.963 --> 21:50.338
I love it.

21:55.442 --> 21:57.037
Perhaps
we rest the blade for now.

22:01.107 --> 22:02.449
Mother!

22:07.322 --> 22:09.324
What are you staring at?

22:09.324 --> 22:10.820
I don’t know.

22:12.525 --> 22:14.054
A premonition, perhaps.

22:14.054 --> 22:16.727
Good things, I hope?

22:39.321 --> 22:41.950
The Romans are here!

23:00.034 --> 23:01.706
Legions, attention!

23:03.037 --> 23:05.875
Make way for our
most esteemed procurator,

23:05.875 --> 23:07.349
Catus Decianus!

23:08.174 --> 23:10.110
Legion! Outward!

24:07.068 --> 24:09.939
My lord, this day the Iceni
welcomed you here.

24:09.939 --> 24:11.380
To our lands.

24:11.380 --> 24:13.514
Today, we pay tribute
to the Empire.

24:13.514 --> 24:15.714
Come. Go with us inside.

24:24.250 --> 24:26.120
...Iurat capillos esse,

24:27.121 --> 24:29.024
quos emit, suos.

24:29.024 --> 24:31.895
numquid illa,

24:31.895 --> 24:33.193
Paule, peierat?

24:36.834 --> 24:39.870
Well done! They pleased you, no?

24:41.971 --> 24:46.272
Dare I presume to ask
whether they have Roman tutors?

24:46.272 --> 24:47.548
They do.

24:47.548 --> 24:49.649
I knew it!
I told you, Maximus,

24:49.649 --> 24:52.454
I told you that they had
Roman tutors for their children.

24:52.454 --> 24:54.049
When I was in Africa,

24:54.049 --> 24:56.425
I witnessed a dancing monkey

24:56.425 --> 24:59.087
that had been taught
by a Roman tutor.

24:59.087 --> 25:01.122
They really are
the best in the world.

25:01.122 --> 25:03.025
They can teach anybody

25:03.025 --> 25:04.433
the basics of culture.

25:04.433 --> 25:06.864
Even these barbarian children.

25:09.229 --> 25:12.705
How long do you intend to grace
us with your presence, my lord?

25:13.365 --> 25:15.103
A year.

25:15.103 --> 25:16.412
Maybe two.

25:22.374 --> 25:24.013
We’ll leave in the morning.

25:24.013 --> 25:26.917
You need only feed
my small entourage

25:26.917 --> 25:28.380
from your supplies
for tonight,

25:28.380 --> 25:30.756
and, uh, my pay convoy

25:30.756 --> 25:32.285
on the ides of each third month,

25:32.285 --> 25:33.825
en route to Fallbrook Forest.

25:33.825 --> 25:35.959
Don‘t worry,
my brittunculi friend.

25:35.959 --> 25:38.060
We haven’t come
to clean you out.

25:38.060 --> 25:41.195
Well, you’re welcome to stay
as long as you wish.

25:41.195 --> 25:44.363
It is an honor to host you.

25:44.363 --> 25:46.002
So, tell me, Prasutagus...

25:47.476 --> 25:49.368
You built this fort yourself?

25:49.368 --> 25:52.778
No, it is a holding
handed down within my family.

25:52.778 --> 25:55.407
I have merely
improved upon it, and...

25:55.407 --> 25:59.081
will continue to maintain
it for our next generation.

25:59.081 --> 26:01.853
Then your family
stole it from someone.

26:03.085 --> 26:04.625
Bought it, traded, or won it.

26:04.625 --> 26:07.188
- My ancestors had a reputation

26:07.188 --> 26:09.993
for avoiding violence
when necessary.

26:10.928 --> 26:13.634
And I try to uphold
the same tradition.

26:13.634 --> 26:16.032
My king is the personification

26:16.032 --> 26:18.067
of the civilization
in this land.

26:24.546 --> 26:27.516
Solid, bed-rock foundation!

26:29.012 --> 26:31.146
Arable land that you till

26:31.146 --> 26:34.820
and keep fertile with manure
of the beasts that graze here.

26:34.820 --> 26:38.087
And, uh, soil that
does not hold damp,

26:38.087 --> 26:39.825
with the elevation water run-off

26:39.825 --> 26:41.453
and down-hill mitigation.

26:41.453 --> 26:45.391
And the view?
Well, unimpeded from all sides.

26:46.458 --> 26:48.064
I warrant that on a clear day

26:48.064 --> 26:50.638
you can see all the way
to the Watling road.

26:51.804 --> 26:52.970
You are correct.

26:52.970 --> 26:55.434
It’s no wonder that this fort

26:55.434 --> 26:58.811
has been so sought-after
this last millennium.

26:58.811 --> 27:01.143
My British king.

27:02.980 --> 27:05.554
We serve you well here, Lord.

27:07.149 --> 27:08.348
Yes.

27:08.348 --> 27:10.251
Yes indeed, you do.

27:16.092 --> 27:19.194
We’re going to have to be
very well-behaved Britons.

27:19.194 --> 27:22.934
This officious bastard could
royally fuck us if he chooses.

27:22.934 --> 27:24.804
We have to be smart about this.

27:24.804 --> 27:26.608
We make ourselves indispensable.

27:28.500 --> 27:32.977
You are--
Right. Of course.

27:32.977 --> 27:34.913
Now, ready the guards to leave.

27:34.913 --> 27:37.553
We’ll run raiding parties
for a few days.

27:37.553 --> 27:40.149
Round up any bandits,
cattle thieves, undesirables,

27:40.149 --> 27:42.415
and we’ll send those
to Catus Decianus as a tribute.

27:44.021 --> 27:45.660
Knowing these lands
are dangerous

27:45.660 --> 27:48.564
might temper his desires
to settle here.

27:51.193 --> 27:53.734
You’re a wise man, my lord.

27:53.734 --> 27:55.901
I’ll ride with the party.

27:55.901 --> 27:57.496
Exercise will do me good.

28:08.474 --> 28:10.685
I have such a thirst
for you, woman!

28:10.685 --> 28:14.986
A dryness in my soul
that only you can quench.

28:14.986 --> 28:16.449
Mother, Father!

28:16.449 --> 28:18.319
Oh, school is over?

28:18.319 --> 28:19.694
Yes.

28:19.694 --> 28:20.926
I need to take
a good look at you.

28:20.926 --> 28:23.192
Now you need to promise me

28:23.192 --> 28:25.392
that you will always stay
by your mother’s side.

28:26.492 --> 28:27.559
Promise?

28:27.559 --> 28:28.736
Promise.

28:28.736 --> 28:30.969
All three of you, stay warm.

28:31.970 --> 28:33.070
I promise.

28:35.336 --> 28:37.679
And I need you to know
that I love you.

28:38.647 --> 28:40.077
And I always will.

28:45.049 --> 28:46.248
I love you too.

29:53.447 --> 29:56.021
The men are back!
Close the gate!

30:32.486 --> 30:33.685
Aaargh!

31:15.837 --> 31:18.037
Long live the
Queen of the Iceni.

32:58.973 --> 33:01.701
All hail Caesar Augustus Nero!

33:03.978 --> 33:05.947
Hail, Catus Decianus.

33:07.113 --> 33:08.312
Please join us.

33:08.312 --> 33:10.116
I shall not stay...

33:10.116 --> 33:11.986
I feel my presence

33:11.986 --> 33:15.616
weighs heavily on the mood
of the locals.

33:17.123 --> 33:20.192
You read too much
into simple curiosity.

33:20.192 --> 33:22.062
Did you receive my tribute?

33:22.722 --> 33:25.461
Yes. I did.

33:25.461 --> 33:26.759
And I thank you.

33:27.793 --> 33:29.300
You have bequeathed

33:29.300 --> 33:32.270
half of your holdings
and lands to me.

33:33.502 --> 33:37.374
’Tis a most
generous acquiescence.

33:37.374 --> 33:39.607
I’m glad
his lordship is satisfied.

33:40.641 --> 33:42.214
Oh, I have not said that.

33:44.546 --> 33:47.648
As a woman,
Rome cannot

33:47.648 --> 33:52.389
and will not
recognize you as queen.

33:55.194 --> 33:57.933
No female is recognized
as worthy

33:58.758 --> 34:00.892
of any position
of governing power.

34:02.036 --> 34:04.665
To do so is a rebuke
against Rome,

34:04.665 --> 34:06.832
Senate, and Empire!

34:06.832 --> 34:09.736
And a personal indignity
to the Emperor.

34:09.736 --> 34:12.277
To try and bribe me

34:12.277 --> 34:16.545
into turning a blind eye
to this wanton ridicule,

34:16.545 --> 34:18.910
this perversion of our laws,

34:18.910 --> 34:20.582
is a crime!

34:20.582 --> 34:23.783
One that begs
to be punished to the full.

34:24.619 --> 34:25.961
I don’t understand you.

34:25.961 --> 34:27.853
Well then let me make it simple

34:27.853 --> 34:29.998
for your barbarian brain
to ingest...

34:29.998 --> 34:35.036
I shall not be taking half
of your holdings and lands.

34:35.036 --> 34:38.369
all
of your kingdom.

34:38.369 --> 34:42.010
And you will be flogged.

34:42.010 --> 34:45.442
A fate shared by
your children,

34:45.442 --> 34:46.938
while you watch.

34:48.544 --> 34:50.117
Oh, you look to Ciaran!

34:51.151 --> 34:55.056
The man who told me
where you husband would be

34:55.056 --> 34:56.750
the day he was killed.

34:59.060 --> 35:03.856
Roman gold will make a convert
of the weak and covetous.

35:07.629 --> 35:10.764
Stand... down!

35:10.764 --> 35:12.139
No, please!

35:23.975 --> 35:26.681
Appointed by the Empire,

35:26.681 --> 35:29.552
bequeathed
by the Emperor himself,

35:30.256 --> 35:32.423
my word is law

35:32.423 --> 35:34.623
as if spoken by Nero!

35:36.064 --> 35:39.496
Henceforth, all land
and properties

35:39.496 --> 35:44.798
owned by Prasutagus of Iceni

35:44.798 --> 35:45.865
are mine!

35:48.472 --> 35:49.737
Hail Nero.

35:59.648 --> 36:01.254
Aaaaah!

36:08.162 --> 36:10.560
Don’t you dare touch her!

36:15.136 --> 36:17.105
Noooo! Aaaaah!

36:22.836 --> 36:26.411
This was a gift from Nero.

36:27.214 --> 36:29.282
One holds it into fire

36:30.349 --> 36:32.120
then pushes it onto the face

36:32.120 --> 36:37.015
of any misbehaving slave,
thus branding them his property.

36:37.015 --> 36:38.225
N. R.

36:38.225 --> 36:41.393
Nero Rex Dramus.

36:41.393 --> 36:42.823
A-Although, in your case,

36:42.823 --> 36:44.693
the N. R. could stand for

36:45.023 --> 36:46.959
Nec Regina.

36:47.696 --> 36:48.796
Queen no more.

36:49.863 --> 36:53.240
Any disruptive brittunculi

36:53.240 --> 36:54.703
looking to you

36:54.703 --> 36:57.310
will see this mark, laugh,

36:57.310 --> 37:00.038
and be reminded
of your falsehood.

37:06.880 --> 37:08.288
Ohhh...

37:10.158 --> 37:12.490
The illicit smell
of burning flesh.

38:34.935 --> 38:36.607
Shh, shh, shh.

38:36.607 --> 38:38.906
Quiet. You must come with us.

39:19.584 --> 39:21.652
die here.

39:21.652 --> 39:23.588
We have to keep moving.

40:09.029 --> 40:12.263
Mmm... Girls?

40:15.376 --> 40:16.476
Girls?

40:24.077 --> 40:25.683
Where are my daughters?

40:27.212 --> 40:28.554
Where are my daughters?

40:28.554 --> 40:29.687
Shhh.

40:32.921 --> 40:34.857
Were they hurt?

40:34.857 --> 40:36.727
Where are my daughters?

40:39.092 --> 40:40.797
Woah, woah, woah.

40:43.635 --> 40:46.440
Ugh! Oh, I forgot.

40:47.540 --> 40:48.739
Ohhh.

40:51.544 --> 40:53.678
I can’t understand
what happened.

40:54.646 --> 40:56.582
You must bring them.

40:56.582 --> 40:58.650
You must bring them, I...

40:58.650 --> 40:59.981
I want to hug them.

40:59.981 --> 41:02.049
- Where are my children?

41:04.656 --> 41:08.319
We... are your children, Boudica.

41:25.611 --> 41:27.415
I need to see my girls.

41:32.684 --> 41:35.247
- There you are, Mother!
- Mother, darling!

41:35.247 --> 41:37.216
Oh! Babies!

41:42.320 --> 41:44.399
My babies!

41:50.570 --> 41:51.934
I’m so sorry!

41:53.969 --> 41:56.609
I’m so, so sorry.

41:56.609 --> 41:58.908
I couldn’t protect you.

41:59.645 --> 42:02.780
You know...
I fought so hard.

42:05.420 --> 42:07.455
I tried everything.

42:09.050 --> 42:11.250
It’s all right, Mother.

42:11.250 --> 42:13.087
We’re here with you now.

42:20.391 --> 42:21.568
For your mouth.

42:24.835 --> 42:27.398
- What?
- For teeth.

42:34.174 --> 42:36.979
She says a warrior
must be able to bite.

42:36.979 --> 42:40.653
She stole it from
the mouth of a dead centurion.

42:40.653 --> 42:42.314
Ohhh...

42:42.314 --> 42:44.756
So happy.

42:44.756 --> 42:47.022
You must eat.

42:47.022 --> 42:49.926
She is a warrior.
And a soothsayer.

42:51.565 --> 42:53.391
She says that
you are to be queen.

42:53.391 --> 42:56.130
That your task is
to kill the Romans.

42:57.428 --> 42:58.935
We are here
to help you, Mother.

43:00.508 --> 43:01.971
My babies.

43:03.610 --> 43:05.073
My babies!

43:08.340 --> 43:09.583
You must eat.

43:38.403 --> 43:39.910
What are you learning?

43:39.910 --> 43:42.473
We learn how
to use weapons.

43:42.473 --> 43:44.684
Must a Trinovante woman fight?

43:44.684 --> 43:47.049
A Trinovante woman
can do anything.

43:47.049 --> 43:48.479
Best of all, they fight.

43:50.250 --> 43:52.285
Can I spend some time
with you, my dears?

43:52.285 --> 43:54.826
It feels like
I’ve seen nothing of you.

43:56.564 --> 43:57.961
Mmm...

44:02.427 --> 44:05.573
- I’m sorry I’ve disturbed you.
- You haven’t.

44:06.640 --> 44:08.840
Is there anything I can get
for you, my queen?

44:08.840 --> 44:11.106
I’ve got everything
I need right now.

44:11.106 --> 44:12.580
But thank you.

44:16.507 --> 44:18.509
She’s looked after you well.

44:18.509 --> 44:20.786
She is our friend, Mother.

44:20.786 --> 44:22.018
Where are her children?

44:22.018 --> 44:23.987
The Romans killed her children.

44:23.987 --> 44:26.990
She had daughters. Like us.

44:26.990 --> 44:29.124
These people want you
to be their queen.

44:29.124 --> 44:31.357
They say you’re chosen.
It’s an honor.

44:31.357 --> 44:33.634
Oh no, I wasn’t chosen.

44:33.634 --> 44:35.163
I was double-crossed
and betrayed,

44:35.163 --> 44:37.572
and my people
let this happen!

44:37.572 --> 44:39.574
No, they mean that
Catus chose you.

44:39.574 --> 44:41.367
When he branded you.

44:42.940 --> 44:44.271
No, this...

44:44.271 --> 44:46.878
It’s a mark of humiliation.

44:46.878 --> 44:49.375
To the Trinovante,
you have been anointed.

44:49.375 --> 44:51.542
It is our duty
to bring the tribes together.

44:51.542 --> 44:54.281
To kill the Romans.

44:54.281 --> 44:56.657
Do you remember what
Catus ordered his men to do?

44:56.657 --> 44:58.351
In front of your friends,
your family?

44:58.351 --> 45:00.661
Oh I do, I do.
I’m sorry.

45:00.661 --> 45:02.927
I’m really, really sorry.

45:06.095 --> 45:07.668
You were the Queen of Iceni.

45:07.668 --> 45:09.329
are
the Queen of Iceni.

45:09.329 --> 45:12.068
These people need you now
more than ever.

45:12.068 --> 45:13.806
You really have no choice.

45:22.749 --> 45:24.377
Wait!

45:24.377 --> 45:25.752
I’ll show you.

45:27.050 --> 45:29.987
Neck, under the arm.

45:30.988 --> 45:32.088
Wrist.

45:33.353 --> 45:34.827
Stomach will stop,

45:34.827 --> 45:36.389
but it won’t kill.

45:36.389 --> 45:39.227
This is where most
wear their armor thickest.

45:39.227 --> 45:42.032
Neck, under the arm,

45:42.032 --> 45:43.968
under the armor.

45:43.968 --> 45:45.904
These’ll be your targets.

45:45.904 --> 45:47.004
Show me.

45:48.467 --> 45:50.403
Neck!

45:50.403 --> 45:53.406
- Ooh! Wah!
- Yes.

45:57.509 --> 45:58.752
This is for you.

46:12.865 --> 46:14.702
Where did you get this?

46:15.901 --> 46:17.870
Catus gave it to a Roman.

46:17.870 --> 46:19.201
I killed him.

46:19.201 --> 46:20.873
And now it is
yours again.

46:27.242 --> 46:28.683
Don’t cry, Mother.

46:28.683 --> 46:30.146
We can’t show weakness.

46:30.146 --> 46:33.380
Bronze is the metal of the past.

46:33.380 --> 46:34.755
It won’t hold an edge.

46:34.755 --> 46:36.317
Heavy and unwieldy.

46:36.317 --> 46:38.253
More dangerous to its owner
than its enemy.

46:38.253 --> 46:40.453
Not this blade.
Not to me.

46:40.453 --> 46:42.697
Who’s using
my training area?

46:50.936 --> 46:54.599
You’re the Iceni queen that’s
come to save us, aren’t you?

46:54.599 --> 46:56.172
They call her Boudica.

46:56.172 --> 47:00.143
- That’s a bold name.
- I did not choose it.

47:00.143 --> 47:02.673
I see the brand on your face,

47:02.673 --> 47:06.347
and I’ve, uh, seen
what a cat-of-nine-tails

47:06.347 --> 47:08.151
does to a man’s back.

47:08.151 --> 47:11.286
But how does that qualify you
to lead the Trinovante?

47:11.286 --> 47:14.388
Why should you be leader
and not me?

47:16.522 --> 47:17.930
I’m just Boudica.

47:19.492 --> 47:21.769
I fought as an auxiliary
for the Romans.

47:21.769 --> 47:23.694
So I know how they train,

47:23.694 --> 47:26.532
how they tool up,
how they fight.

47:26.532 --> 47:27.698
How they think.

47:27.698 --> 47:30.778
Now I’m a deserter,
marked for death.

47:30.778 --> 47:32.703
As are all my men!

47:32.703 --> 47:34.177
But I’ve returned...

47:34.177 --> 47:37.444
to lead my people
out of Roman bondage.

47:37.444 --> 47:39.380
So you’d best step aside.

47:47.993 --> 47:52.866
Is that what you’re going
to challenge the Romans with?

47:52.866 --> 47:54.560
Bronze was good,

47:54.560 --> 47:56.199
when that was all we had.

47:56.903 --> 47:58.102
Iron...

47:59.202 --> 48:01.204
That’s the way
of modern warfare.

48:02.568 --> 48:03.734
May I?

48:16.681 --> 48:17.990
By the gods,

48:17.990 --> 48:19.387
it’s ugly in the hand,

48:19.387 --> 48:21.994
heavy, imbalanced.

48:23.358 --> 48:25.096
There’s no life to it.

48:25.096 --> 48:26.724
That’s why we don’t use
bronze anymore.

48:26.724 --> 48:28.165
Let me do you a favor!

48:30.662 --> 48:32.268
Huh!

48:36.239 --> 48:37.339
What?

48:38.307 --> 48:41.409
What? I did you a favor!

48:41.409 --> 48:42.509
Where is she?

48:46.711 --> 48:48.218
That blade was shit.

48:48.218 --> 48:50.187
Any real warrior
would know that.

48:58.899 --> 49:00.560
There’s strong currents
in there.

49:00.560 --> 49:02.760
Strong enough to hold a man
down and drown him.

49:02.760 --> 49:06.203
Now I feel responsible.
Should I go in?

49:06.203 --> 49:07.369
What’s so interesting?

49:11.538 --> 49:14.310
Maybe this sword chooses
who it performs for.

49:14.310 --> 49:16.180
How did you reshape the blade?

49:16.180 --> 49:18.380
This is how I found it.

49:19.414 --> 49:21.119
This should be interesting.

49:32.064 --> 49:34.132
I was an archer in Armenia,

49:34.132 --> 49:36.365
tracker for Galba in Spain,

49:36.365 --> 49:38.037
swordsman for Rome.

49:39.830 --> 49:41.469
In all of my years
living by the sword

49:41.469 --> 49:44.076
I’ve never seen anything
like this before.

49:44.076 --> 49:46.243
Our people asked
the gods of the land

49:46.243 --> 49:47.981
to provide us a leader,

49:47.981 --> 49:49.378
and now they have!

49:51.842 --> 49:53.052
Queen Boudica...

49:55.351 --> 49:56.682
Kneel.

49:57.749 --> 49:58.849
Accept me,

49:58.849 --> 50:01.588
and my men,
as your loyal servants.

50:35.391 --> 50:38.196
I was happy being
a collaborator,

50:38.196 --> 50:39.395
and a wife.

50:43.366 --> 50:44.532
Now...

50:45.533 --> 50:47.238
those two girls are...

50:47.238 --> 50:52.078
the only trace
of the old me.

50:54.443 --> 50:56.148
You think I can do this?

51:01.417 --> 51:03.221
You’re the only one who can.

51:06.521 --> 51:07.654
Yeah.

51:15.728 --> 51:18.731
Forged
by Catuvellauni craftsmen...

51:19.600 --> 51:22.108
before the time
of the Trinovante

51:22.108 --> 51:23.505
or the Iceni.

51:23.505 --> 51:26.310
The symbol of your royalty...

51:28.411 --> 51:33.218
stolen by the invaders from Rome
and returned to you now.

51:34.879 --> 51:39.059
Do you choose
the royal torque, Boudica?

51:41.259 --> 51:42.887
Put it on.

51:42.887 --> 51:45.824
You must choose it.
It’s yours.

51:49.234 --> 51:52.435
In the name
of the four kings of Kent,

51:52.435 --> 51:55.009
Queen Boudica!

51:55.009 --> 51:58.804
Boudica!

52:00.047 --> 52:05.151
I am Boudica.
You are my people.

52:05.151 --> 52:07.516
We are in a time
of extreme peril.

52:09.320 --> 52:12.092
We fight for our freedom!

52:12.092 --> 52:13.489
Yes!

52:13.489 --> 52:15.623
honor!
- Yes!

52:15.623 --> 52:17.658
The Romans fight for pay.

52:17.658 --> 52:19.066
We know that
the Romans are paid

52:19.066 --> 52:21.134
on the ides
of every third month.

52:21.134 --> 52:22.828
In two days’ time,

52:22.828 --> 52:25.105
Catus Decianus
will lead a pay convoy

52:25.105 --> 52:28.075
from Londinium to Venonis
and then to Eboracum.

52:28.075 --> 52:33.003
That will lead him straight
through Fallbrook Forest.

52:33.003 --> 52:35.082
Where we shall ambush him.

52:37.480 --> 52:40.912
Catus Decianus has
a centurie of 80 men,

52:42.122 --> 52:45.158
Batavian auxiliaries marching
with him at all times,

52:45.158 --> 52:47.820
along with mounted Equites
and Galician mercenaries.

52:47.820 --> 52:51.494
He will destroy any ambush
you set. Any ambush.

52:51.494 --> 52:53.430
It’s a perfect setup.

52:53.430 --> 52:57.335
The Romans have been plundering
our gold for 20 years!

52:57.335 --> 52:59.766
I think it’s time
to take it back.

52:59.766 --> 53:00.701
Yes!

53:00.701 --> 53:03.110
We must plan a war!

53:03.110 --> 53:06.773
Wolfgar, if you’re not
behind me in Fallbrook Forest,

53:06.773 --> 53:10.040
I will fight Catus alone.

53:10.040 --> 53:11.580
But I will fight him.

53:12.647 --> 53:14.880
You’re as mad
as a March hare.

53:15.749 --> 53:19.555
No. I’m as clear-headed
as I’ve ever been.

53:24.692 --> 53:28.366
I need to know
if you are with me.

53:53.050 --> 53:54.359
Give me my sword.

54:01.201 --> 54:02.763
Thank you.

54:09.572 --> 54:11.772
Was I the only one who saw that?

54:25.049 --> 54:28.195
Our world is...
full of signs.

54:31.924 --> 54:33.497
She must be the one.

54:39.866 --> 54:42.176
You don’t approve, huh?

54:44.310 --> 54:46.807
Your silence speaks volumes.

54:46.807 --> 54:49.678
You ask a lot
of a simple people.

54:51.141 --> 54:52.879
When opportunity
presents itself,

54:52.879 --> 54:54.419
we must seize it.

54:54.419 --> 54:57.323
And Catus in the forest
is an opportunity.

54:57.323 --> 54:58.885
Did I do wrong?

54:59.655 --> 55:01.657
You should not act
so willfully.

55:01.657 --> 55:04.330
They call me queen.

55:04.330 --> 55:06.464
And then
they question my plan.

55:07.432 --> 55:11.029
It’s OK. We’ll do this
on our own, girls.

55:11.029 --> 55:12.338
Look behind you, Mother.

55:26.781 --> 55:30.389
What they say about you
cannot be more true.

55:30.389 --> 55:32.853
We have chosen you
as our queen.

55:33.788 --> 55:35.053
Boudica!

55:35.053 --> 55:37.627
Boudica! Boudica!

56:13.223 --> 56:15.632
Step off the road, brittunculi.

56:18.635 --> 56:20.736
Who the fuck
are you talking to?

56:21.638 --> 56:24.168
Halt!

56:25.037 --> 56:26.643
You, peasant...

56:37.049 --> 56:38.358
You were dead.

56:38.358 --> 56:39.722
I’m your queen.

56:39.722 --> 56:42.494
Or has your ambition
blinded you?

56:44.925 --> 56:46.091
My queen.

56:53.406 --> 56:56.673
I don’t know how
or why you’re here,

56:56.673 --> 56:58.906
but you must leave now.

56:58.906 --> 57:00.380
I am queen,

57:00.380 --> 57:02.580
and I’d like to speak
to your regent,

57:02.580 --> 57:04.846
Catus Decianus.

57:06.177 --> 57:07.882
If you don’t go now,

57:07.882 --> 57:10.753
he will crucify you
this time.

57:12.953 --> 57:14.185
Send word.

57:14.185 --> 57:17.991
The queen of the Iceni
wishes to parlay.

57:19.333 --> 57:20.796
If you don’t tell him,

57:20.796 --> 57:22.798
he’ll have you whipped
like me.

57:22.798 --> 57:25.097
I guarantee you that.

57:25.999 --> 57:27.132
Hm.

57:33.138 --> 57:34.678
Take a good look!

57:35.877 --> 57:38.781
If you live
to have children,

57:38.781 --> 57:40.354
they’ll ask about me.

57:42.114 --> 57:44.919
Where is this brittunculi queen

57:44.919 --> 57:48.153
who would dare
stop my cohort?

57:50.892 --> 57:54.500
Well... Speak, she-dog.

57:54.500 --> 57:58.702
I’m upset you don’t
recognize me, dear Catus,

57:58.702 --> 58:01.804
or has time been
so unkind to me?

58:04.411 --> 58:06.545
She is clearly insane.

58:06.545 --> 58:08.173
Remove and pillar her head

58:08.173 --> 58:12.683
and don’t stop us
on such trivialities again!

58:12.683 --> 58:16.280
I’m Queen Boudica
of the Iceni and the Trinovante,

58:16.280 --> 58:19.822
the Celts, the Saxons,
of the northern Britons!

58:20.955 --> 58:25.828
I am the wife
of King Prasutagus.

58:25.828 --> 58:28.798
And it will take
a lot more than your blood

58:28.798 --> 58:31.031
to cleanse the foulness
you inflicted

58:31.031 --> 58:33.132
on me and my daughters!

58:33.132 --> 58:36.168
Catus Decianus.

58:36.168 --> 58:38.478
Yeah. Come closer,

58:38.478 --> 58:40.711
and have a good look
at my face.

58:41.547 --> 58:43.549
Something you remember?

58:46.882 --> 58:48.279
Bou-di-ca.

58:51.018 --> 58:54.186
Nec Regina!

58:55.660 --> 58:59.191
Your scar has healed.

58:59.191 --> 59:04.735
My men prefer to train
with live targets!

59:04.735 --> 59:06.968
Perhaps I shall grant them
that privilege.

59:06.968 --> 59:08.442
Now, my children.

59:11.302 --> 59:12.578
What witchery is this?

01:02:42.755 --> 01:02:44.922
He was hiding in the woods.

01:02:44.922 --> 01:02:47.122
Aaah!

01:02:47.122 --> 01:02:50.290
Hail, Queen Boudica!

01:02:51.522 --> 01:02:52.798
You traitor!

01:02:57.594 --> 01:03:00.366
You traitor! Traitor!

01:03:02.269 --> 01:03:03.600
Traitor!

01:03:05.635 --> 01:03:08.539
You were supposed
to protect him.

01:03:12.147 --> 01:03:14.545
Enough! It’s over!

01:03:14.545 --> 01:03:16.723
It’s over.

01:03:16.723 --> 01:03:19.726
We won the day.
It’s over.

01:03:19.726 --> 01:03:22.762
We won the day.

01:03:22.762 --> 01:03:26.095
Boudica, my queen.
It’s over.

01:03:26.095 --> 01:03:28.801
It’s not over
until every Roman has gone.

01:03:30.165 --> 01:03:31.364
My queen?

01:03:31.364 --> 01:03:33.707
We ride for Camulos.

01:03:33.707 --> 01:03:36.710
Governor Paulinus is still
biding his time in Rome.

01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:38.206
The last I’ve heard,

01:03:38.206 --> 01:03:39.944
his Gemina Legion
was mopping up Druids

01:03:39.944 --> 01:03:42.848
in Anglesey, so...
The timing is perfect.

01:03:42.848 --> 01:03:45.576
It will need a blessing
from the Druid council.

01:03:46.544 --> 01:03:47.919
You’ll see to it.

01:03:49.723 --> 01:03:51.087
You’re serious.

01:03:52.517 --> 01:03:54.651
And I suspect a little mental.

01:03:54.651 --> 01:03:55.993
My queen.

01:03:58.028 --> 01:04:00.030
But war favors the possessed.

01:04:02.329 --> 01:04:03.429
Where are you going?

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:07.004
I reckon I’m going
to the Druid council

01:04:07.004 --> 01:04:09.699
to try to find
a reason for a...

01:04:09.699 --> 01:04:12.042
Celtic Trinovante invasion
of Camulos.

01:04:13.307 --> 01:04:14.539
You are indeed.

01:04:16.343 --> 01:04:17.443
Yeah.

01:04:47.473 --> 01:04:50.740
When you drink from the skull
of Catus Decianus,

01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:52.786
your victory is complete.

01:04:53.886 --> 01:04:55.118
It’s a tradition.

01:05:12.839 --> 01:05:16.810
There has of late
been a succession of ill omens

01:05:16.810 --> 01:05:19.208
for the Roman occupation force.

01:05:19.208 --> 01:05:22.706
Where they predict
misfortune for Nero,

01:05:22.706 --> 01:05:25.610
they promise fortune
for Brittania.

01:05:26.776 --> 01:05:27.953
and her queen...

01:05:28.745 --> 01:05:30.549
Boudica.

01:05:36.456 --> 01:05:38.524
The council supports your cause.

01:05:38.524 --> 01:05:41.461
us.

01:05:41.461 --> 01:05:43.463
There’s nothing
we cannot achieve.

01:05:50.404 --> 01:05:52.307
You’re staring at me.

01:05:52.307 --> 01:05:54.144
You have your hand
on my knee.

01:05:57.609 --> 01:05:58.808
Oh.

01:06:02.152 --> 01:06:03.747
Twenty years
of killing enemies

01:06:03.747 --> 01:06:05.353
and chasing their wives.

01:06:06.453 --> 01:06:08.422
Forgive me, my queen.

01:06:08.422 --> 01:06:09.995
You’re forgiven.

01:06:09.995 --> 01:06:12.756
But if you ever
touch me like that again,

01:06:12.756 --> 01:06:14.791
I’ll kill you
before your little man

01:06:14.791 --> 01:06:16.793
has had a chance
to raise himself.

01:06:16.793 --> 01:06:18.300
By god, woman,

01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:21.369
if I didn’t already have
two wives...

01:06:21.369 --> 01:06:25.076
You have
a way with words, Wolfgar.

01:06:28.343 --> 01:06:29.575
No one would judge us.

01:06:31.511 --> 01:06:35.185
Two warrior leaders,
a man and a woman,

01:06:36.054 --> 01:06:38.452
forged together
like charcoal and iron

01:06:38.452 --> 01:06:40.894
to become steel
in the furnace of war.

01:06:43.358 --> 01:06:45.459
I am the wife
of King Prasutagus.

01:06:47.659 --> 01:06:48.935
Please leave.

01:07:04.214 --> 01:07:06.876
You’ve come far,
Queen Boudica.

01:07:06.876 --> 01:07:10.055
Life is impermanent.

01:07:10.814 --> 01:07:12.024
Transitory.

01:07:12.024 --> 01:07:16.963
We all die.
You. Your daughters.

01:07:16.963 --> 01:07:20.461
What do my daughters have
to do with this?

01:07:20.461 --> 01:07:23.728
They’re in your mind,
as you survived.

01:07:23.728 --> 01:07:25.037
They did not.

01:07:25.037 --> 01:07:27.072
No. They’re here.

01:07:27.072 --> 01:07:30.977
Like snowflakes in the air.

01:07:32.077 --> 01:07:34.079
So beautiful to watch.

01:07:35.047 --> 01:07:36.741
Snatch one in your hand.

01:07:38.578 --> 01:07:39.909
And when you look...

01:07:40.547 --> 01:07:42.252
It will be gone.

01:07:44.155 --> 01:07:48.489
Like goosebumps,
the first breath of winter.

01:07:49.754 --> 01:07:52.295
They will always be
with you, Boudica.

01:07:53.131 --> 01:07:54.297
As spirits.

01:07:57.036 --> 01:07:58.862
Love what you can.

01:08:00.138 --> 01:08:02.701
Never forget
what it is that you love.

01:08:03.933 --> 01:08:05.572
As it defines you.

01:08:07.541 --> 01:08:09.807
I want to die.

01:08:09.807 --> 01:08:11.050
You will.

01:08:11.908 --> 01:08:15.021
But first, you must lead
your army again.

01:08:15.021 --> 01:08:19.993
The Druid council have
sanctioned your ride to Camulos.

01:08:22.292 --> 01:08:23.491
What if I refuse?

01:08:23.491 --> 01:08:26.263
You’re free to do as you wish.

01:08:26.263 --> 01:08:28.430
There are no rules
in this world.

01:08:29.629 --> 01:08:33.006
Except what death has put there.

01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:59.560
Queen. You must rest.

01:09:01.826 --> 01:09:03.762
Tell me...

01:09:03.762 --> 01:09:05.104
Do you see them?

01:09:05.632 --> 01:09:07.172
Do you see my daughters?

01:09:08.272 --> 01:09:10.835
They’re... good girls.

01:09:10.835 --> 01:09:12.210
They behave well.

01:09:12.210 --> 01:09:13.310
They’ve been waiting for you.

01:09:13.310 --> 01:09:15.279
No, I asked,
do you see them?

01:09:16.841 --> 01:09:18.007
See them?

01:09:18.007 --> 01:09:20.515
We see them
in our hearts, Queen.

01:09:37.598 --> 01:09:39.699
You need to wake up, Mother.

01:09:43.538 --> 01:09:47.938
If you attack Camulos,
the Romans will come after you.

01:09:47.938 --> 01:09:50.215
They will send archers
to destroy you.

01:09:55.484 --> 01:09:57.519
I will kill whoever they send.

01:09:57.519 --> 01:10:01.259
And find where they live
and kill their families.

01:10:02.491 --> 01:10:04.020
You must do it, Mother.

01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:06.759
For us. For Father.

01:10:08.497 --> 01:10:10.235
This would not
have happened,

01:10:10.235 --> 01:10:12.600
had I not chosen
to be queen.

01:10:13.898 --> 01:10:15.966
It was never
your choice, Mother.

01:10:18.034 --> 01:10:21.147
But if I wasn’t a queen,
we would still be together.

01:10:23.875 --> 01:10:25.712
You look so real.

01:10:27.747 --> 01:10:29.320
I can feel you.

01:10:30.585 --> 01:10:31.982
I can smell you.

01:10:35.359 --> 01:10:36.954
But I know you’re not.

01:10:39.693 --> 01:10:41.497
We are here with you, Mother.

01:10:44.599 --> 01:10:47.800
You must get ready.
It’s time.

01:11:13.364 --> 01:11:15.399
The Romans murdered men,
women, and children

01:11:15.399 --> 01:11:17.533
when they occupied
the town of Camulos.

01:11:18.798 --> 01:11:20.503
They made it
a retirement settlement

01:11:20.503 --> 01:11:22.373
for the senior centurions.

01:11:25.002 --> 01:11:27.103
Do you want
to forgive and forget?

01:11:27.103 --> 01:11:30.106
We go home,
live another day?

01:11:32.515 --> 01:11:33.813
Fuck them.

01:11:33.813 --> 01:11:36.453
Hail. That’s my queen.

01:11:40.457 --> 01:11:44.824
Go!

01:12:45.885 --> 01:12:48.525
You’ll make
a handsome centurion,

01:12:48.525 --> 01:12:50.989
Ivan.

01:12:50.989 --> 01:12:53.156
You know
I don’t like that shit!

01:12:57.864 --> 01:12:59.129
Boudica.

01:12:59.129 --> 01:13:00.537
We met them on their ground.

01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:07.280
He was a man
ahead of his time!

01:13:09.876 --> 01:13:10.976
Boudica!

01:13:35.572 --> 01:13:37.134
Beautiful retribution.

01:13:37.134 --> 01:13:40.775
It’s not over.
But it’s a start.

01:14:14.413 --> 01:14:17.240
Why aren’t they celebrating?

01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:19.913
To bear pain.
Tribute to the victory.

01:14:19.913 --> 01:14:21.013
To whom?

01:14:23.422 --> 01:14:24.522
Marco.

01:14:27.888 --> 01:14:31.628
By cutting your mark
into their cheek,

01:14:31.628 --> 01:14:34.400
they pay tribute
to you, my queen.

01:14:40.736 --> 01:14:42.804
Roman soldiers
have their stigma,

01:14:44.069 --> 01:14:46.335
now your men have theirs.

01:14:46.335 --> 01:14:47.578
What?

01:14:47.578 --> 01:14:50.009
Do they know
what it means?

01:14:50.009 --> 01:14:52.176
Who gives a shit?

01:14:52.176 --> 01:14:53.650
They can’t read Latin.

01:14:53.650 --> 01:14:55.751
Or any other language,
for that matter.

01:14:55.751 --> 01:14:58.424
But what matters
is that it’s your mark.

01:14:59.821 --> 01:15:01.185
They’re your army now.

01:15:07.356 --> 01:15:08.599
What are you doing?

01:15:10.997 --> 01:15:14.330
The Romans take pride
in their unit formations,

01:15:14.330 --> 01:15:16.541
and my men
take great pleasure

01:15:16.541 --> 01:15:18.939
in relieving the silks
from the defeated.

01:15:21.711 --> 01:15:24.175
These are the units
you’ve crushed.

01:15:26.485 --> 01:15:28.454
The spoils of war,
my queen.

01:15:31.116 --> 01:15:32.920
It’s not nearly enough.

01:16:42.627 --> 01:16:44.530
Boudica!

01:17:35.273 --> 01:17:39.211
Hold the line!
Hold the line! Don’t break!

01:17:51.025 --> 01:17:52.994
Charge!

01:18:02.201 --> 01:18:04.709
Hold the line!

01:18:46.982 --> 01:18:49.347
The rioting is getting closer.

01:18:49.347 --> 01:18:50.788
It’s dangerous
for you to be here.

01:18:50.788 --> 01:18:52.757
Why do my people protest?

01:18:52.757 --> 01:18:54.693
The war in Europe was costly.

01:18:54.693 --> 01:18:56.354
Your people need a victory.

01:18:57.696 --> 01:18:58.895
It’s not my fault.

01:18:58.895 --> 01:19:01.590
It’s the fault
of that awful woman.

01:19:01.590 --> 01:19:02.998
They were your laws!

01:19:02.998 --> 01:19:05.836
Your orders that
caused the insurrection.

01:19:05.836 --> 01:19:08.806
And now Boudica
and her army seem unstoppable.

01:19:08.806 --> 01:19:10.467
My dear Paulinus...

01:19:11.875 --> 01:19:15.274
I’m a musician,
not a warrior...

01:19:17.881 --> 01:19:20.147
Rome has forsaken me.

01:19:20.147 --> 01:19:21.313
Come with us.

01:19:22.886 --> 01:19:24.723
How will I defend myself?

01:19:24.723 --> 01:19:27.583
We’re not here
to do you harm.

01:19:27.583 --> 01:19:31.191
I have...
only to appear and sing

01:19:31.191 --> 01:19:32.390
to have peace once more

01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:33.930
- in Gaul.
- No!

01:19:46.877 --> 01:19:50.177
Then I shall give Rome
the victory that you could not.

01:19:56.249 --> 01:19:57.855
Prepare the troops to move.

01:19:57.855 --> 01:19:59.252
We sail in the morning.

01:20:40.227 --> 01:20:43.395
They are sending reinforcements
that we cannot defeat.

01:20:43.395 --> 01:20:45.331
Our army needs to recuperate.

01:20:45.331 --> 01:20:47.905
We will return in the spring
with more men from the north

01:20:47.905 --> 01:20:49.401
to bolster your ranks.

01:20:49.401 --> 01:20:52.602
What should my men think
of you leaving?

01:20:52.602 --> 01:20:54.538
You should send them
home as well.

01:20:57.211 --> 01:21:00.181
Because now
the time has come to retreat.

01:21:00.181 --> 01:21:02.381
I cannot lose,
you know that!

01:21:03.085 --> 01:21:05.120
Why not finish
what we started?

01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:08.926
You could become stronger
Briton king before you.

01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:13.898
I don’t ask my men
to fight in the winter.

01:21:15.196 --> 01:21:16.901
Your men should not either.

01:21:18.661 --> 01:21:21.004
When your men wake
to learn that he has left them,

01:21:21.004 --> 01:21:22.566
cause upset.

01:21:22.566 --> 01:21:26.042
He loves you,
but you have rejected him.

01:21:26.042 --> 01:21:27.813
So he leaves.

01:21:27.813 --> 01:21:29.342
Lay down with him.

01:21:29.342 --> 01:21:31.575
He will stay.

01:21:31.575 --> 01:21:34.149
He would be king,
you could be queen.

01:21:34.149 --> 01:21:38.120
Together, you would defy fate
and destroy Rome’s armies.

01:21:39.891 --> 01:21:41.651
I can love only one man.

01:21:42.861 --> 01:21:44.621
What do your daughters say?

01:21:47.723 --> 01:21:50.396
It is our swiftness
that destroyed the Romans.

01:21:51.397 --> 01:21:54.972
Move decisively
and we can end this occupation.

01:21:59.702 --> 01:22:01.341
But it will be without me.

01:22:01.341 --> 01:22:04.949
You’ll be sending
exhausted men to slaughter.

01:22:06.214 --> 01:22:07.677
I can order you to stay.

01:22:08.953 --> 01:22:10.251
Or...

01:22:10.251 --> 01:22:11.417
have you killed.

01:22:13.749 --> 01:22:14.959
You could.

01:22:16.686 --> 01:22:17.786
But you won’t.

01:22:34.110 --> 01:22:36.805
Be sure to take everything.

01:22:36.805 --> 01:22:39.181
Don’t leave anything behind.

01:22:51.963 --> 01:22:53.195
I cast no judgment.

01:22:56.099 --> 01:22:58.728
We will see each other
again in the Earrach.

01:22:58.728 --> 01:23:00.400
When the snow has melted.

01:23:02.039 --> 01:23:04.041
You’re the empress
of the land...

01:23:05.911 --> 01:23:07.044
the sky...

01:23:08.441 --> 01:23:09.574
the moon.

01:23:11.114 --> 01:23:12.918
But you will always be...

01:23:14.117 --> 01:23:15.349
my queen.

01:23:27.658 --> 01:23:29.396
Get yourselves ready!

01:23:29.396 --> 01:23:31.035
I want us moving
by sunlight.

01:23:52.221 --> 01:23:54.091
Who did they send
against me?

01:23:55.026 --> 01:23:56.126
As we speak,

01:23:56.126 --> 01:23:57.853
the great General Gaius Paulinus

01:23:57.853 --> 01:24:01.098
marches on his way
to Watling Street to meet you.

01:24:05.938 --> 01:24:07.137
Then...

01:24:10.437 --> 01:24:12.307
We will welcome him.

01:24:27.256 --> 01:24:30.193
We’ll use their
overconfidence to divide them.

01:24:30.193 --> 01:24:33.658
But these are not soldiers
that come to offer battle.

01:24:33.658 --> 01:24:35.825
They’re amateurs.

01:24:35.825 --> 01:24:39.697
And we, gentlemen,
are professionals.

01:24:41.204 --> 01:24:43.239
Eyes held high in pride

01:24:43.239 --> 01:24:45.670
are less able to see
the uneven ground ahead.

01:25:06.229 --> 01:25:08.297
Boudica! Boudica!

01:25:13.104 --> 01:25:17.636
Boudica! Kill them all!

01:25:23.411 --> 01:25:26.546
Boudica! Kill them all!

01:26:03.088 --> 01:26:04.551
I do not come...

01:26:06.157 --> 01:26:10.953
I do not come to boast
of a great ancestry,

01:26:10.953 --> 01:26:13.230
nor to recover my kingdom.

01:26:13.230 --> 01:26:16.299
I’m here to assert
the cause of liberty!

01:26:16.299 --> 01:26:19.027
Yes!

01:26:19.027 --> 01:26:21.271
From the pride
and arrogance of the Romans,

01:26:21.271 --> 01:26:22.602
nothing is sacred!

01:26:24.538 --> 01:26:27.673
The vindictive gods
are now at hand.

01:26:33.316 --> 01:26:34.449
Look around!

01:26:35.549 --> 01:26:37.848
See your brothers and sisters!

01:26:37.848 --> 01:26:40.224
And view our numbers.

01:26:40.224 --> 01:26:42.853
Behold how our tribes
come together

01:26:42.853 --> 01:26:45.130
to draw the avenging sword.

01:26:48.496 --> 01:26:51.301
On this spot...

01:26:51.301 --> 01:26:53.204
- We must conquer!
- Yes!

01:26:53.204 --> 01:26:56.603
Or die with glory.

01:26:57.868 --> 01:27:00.838
There is no alternative!

01:27:05.909 --> 01:27:08.043
Boudica! Kill them all!

01:27:23.366 --> 01:27:24.796
Attack!

01:27:34.443 --> 01:27:35.576
Aaaaaaah!

01:27:40.009 --> 01:27:42.946
Infantry, split the line!

01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:45.553
Auxiliary...

01:27:45.553 --> 01:27:46.686
Hold...

01:27:46.686 --> 01:27:47.786
Hold!

01:27:49.392 --> 01:27:50.624
Check your bearing!

01:27:53.396 --> 01:27:55.299
Archers, forward!

01:27:55.299 --> 01:27:56.333
Archers...

01:27:56.333 --> 01:27:57.466
pull!

01:28:23.657 --> 01:28:24.955
Turn the chariot over!

01:28:24.955 --> 01:28:26.055
Turn it over!

01:28:34.503 --> 01:28:35.669
Draw...

01:28:51.322 --> 01:28:53.181
Draw... Loose!

01:28:55.018 --> 01:28:56.360
Fire!

01:29:09.802 --> 01:29:10.902
Fire!

01:29:20.384 --> 01:29:25.752
Keep it coming, let’s go.
Lay into them. Wipe them out!

01:29:28.216 --> 01:29:31.329
Ask your daughters
for help, Boudica. Now!

01:29:33.397 --> 01:29:34.992
Girls!

01:29:34.992 --> 01:29:36.598
Are you going to help us?

01:29:36.598 --> 01:29:39.128
The time for fighting
is over, Mother.

01:29:39.898 --> 01:29:41.900
Then what?

01:29:41.900 --> 01:29:43.605
It’s time
for you to join us.

01:29:46.839 --> 01:29:48.071
What do they say?

01:29:52.647 --> 01:29:56.519
After all we’ve been through,
want to die cowering.

01:29:59.247 --> 01:30:01.018
I go where you go.

01:30:01.018 --> 01:30:02.459
On my command.

01:30:05.561 --> 01:30:06.793
On your word, my queen.

01:30:06.793 --> 01:30:09.499
Let’s go.

01:30:43.126 --> 01:30:44.567
Boudica!

01:30:44.567 --> 01:30:45.799
Aaaaah!

01:31:46.596 --> 01:31:47.861
Boudica!

01:31:49.291 --> 01:31:50.699
Boudica!

01:31:51.865 --> 01:31:54.670
You are,
and you always will be,

01:31:54.670 --> 01:31:55.803
my queen!

01:32:21.433 --> 01:32:23.468
No!

01:32:46.986 --> 01:32:49.692
Time to be a wife
and mother again.

01:32:49.692 --> 01:32:51.419
To love and to cherish.

01:32:53.355 --> 01:32:55.566
Today,
your name in sacrifice

01:32:55.566 --> 01:32:58.261
is more important
than your victory in battle.

01:32:58.261 --> 01:33:00.065
It’s time to go, Mother.

01:34:08.496 --> 01:34:10.135
Yaaaah!
