01:59.619 --> 02:02.788
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

02:03.891 --> 02:06.525
I can't do this.

02:11.532 --> 02:14.566
Bachelor party! Bachelor party!
Bachelor party!

02:14.568 --> 02:17.569
Bachelor party!
Bachelor party! Bachelor party!

02:17.571 --> 02:20.539
Bachelor party! Bachelor party!
Bachelor party!

02:20.541 --> 02:23.475
Bachelor party!
Bachelor party! Bachelor party!

02:23.477 --> 02:27.379
Bachelor party! Bachelor party!
Bachelor party! Bachelor party!

02:27.381 --> 02:28.881
Hey, hey.

02:28.883 --> 02:30.883
You gotta catch up.
Here, here, here.

02:30.885 --> 02:32.751
You're late to your own
bachelor party,

02:32.753 --> 02:34.887
- chug, chug, chug.
- What are you doing?

02:34.889 --> 02:35.987
I'm sorry.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.257
- Why did you do that?
- You held my nose.

02:38.259 --> 02:40.192
It's like a shotgun.
You plug the shotgun hole.

02:40.194 --> 02:41.927
- You're an idiot.
- You are an idiot, Nick.

02:41.929 --> 02:44.763
You wouldn't know an idiot
if it smacked you in the face.

02:44.765 --> 02:48.400
Smack me in the face,
so I have a frame of reference.

02:48.402 --> 02:51.537
- You want a slap fight?
- Yeah, yeah.

02:51.539 --> 02:55.641
I'm so glad you're here, man.
These two make me wanna puke.

02:55.643 --> 02:57.176
That's a very underwhelming
mustache.

02:57.178 --> 03:00.179
Why do you guys
all have mustaches?

03:00.181 --> 03:03.382
We have mustaches for you,
for your bachelor party.

03:03.384 --> 03:04.950
Did we not discuss this
with you?

03:04.952 --> 03:05.950
No.

03:05.952 --> 03:08.520
- Really?
- Yeah. What about Nick?

03:08.522 --> 03:11.323
Nick got confused.

03:11.325 --> 03:13.492
I thought I texted you from
my second phone. I'm so sorry.

03:13.494 --> 03:15.194
No, I think I would've
remembered that.

03:15.196 --> 03:17.529
I'm sorry. I guess I haven't
seen you in a while.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.231
How you been?

03:19.233 --> 03:21.366
- Not great, actually.
- Just hold on tight

03:21.368 --> 03:24.570
'cause these guys have been
living for this week.

03:24.572 --> 03:25.771
Yeah, look, the thing is...

03:25.773 --> 03:27.639
Wait, wait, wait!
We got rules.

03:27.641 --> 03:29.474
You need to learn the rules.

03:29.476 --> 03:32.411
Colin and me wrote rules,
and you gotta learn 'em.

03:32.413 --> 03:34.580
- They made rules.
- Yeah!

03:36.383 --> 03:38.350
Bachelor parties.

03:38.352 --> 03:43.589
I'm so sick of going to
bachelor parties and fishing.

03:44.725 --> 03:47.292
- Or whitewater rafting.
- Boo!

03:47.294 --> 03:48.660
That is not a bachelor party.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.229
- That's a party.
- It's just camping.

03:50.231 --> 03:51.897
A bunch of cock and balls
sleeping in the woods.

03:51.899 --> 03:54.233
- It's a schlong-a-thon.
- Now, this great tradition

03:54.235 --> 03:56.935
is not only a send-off
of one's bachelorhood,

03:56.937 --> 03:59.605
but a way to send
said bachelor off

03:59.607 --> 04:03.375
with a train car
full of regret so deep,

04:03.377 --> 04:05.310
you'll never wanna be
a bachelor again.

04:05.312 --> 04:07.512
That's beautiful, Colin,
really, but, guys...

04:07.514 --> 04:10.682
Rule number one, get drunk.

04:10.684 --> 04:13.385
Fastest train to regret
is alcohol.

04:13.387 --> 04:17.356
Rule number two, stay drunk.

04:17.358 --> 04:18.724
I wrote the first two rules.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.692
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, Nick!
- It's okay.

04:20.694 --> 04:22.494
- I knew you'd freak out.
- Is he drinking?

04:22.496 --> 04:25.397
It's been five years, man.
I need a fucking break.

04:25.399 --> 04:27.299
- I don't think...
- Who cares if he dies?

04:27.301 --> 04:29.401
- It doesn't work that way.
- I can have a beer or two,

04:29.403 --> 04:32.271
in celebration of
your bachelor party,<i> dad.</i>

04:32.273 --> 04:34.573
I wouldn't even be doing this
if you weren't getting married.

04:34.575 --> 04:35.941
- No.
- It's on you, Joe.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.876
- No.
- There's a meeting on Monday.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.945
- I'll be there, okay? Promise.
- Look...

04:39.947 --> 04:42.414
- Or Tuesday at the latest.
- I'll give you a ride.

04:42.416 --> 04:43.815
I don't think
that's really the point.

04:43.817 --> 04:46.918
Rule number three, hit the bar.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.820
- Yeah!
- There's no better place

04:48.822 --> 04:51.356
to hop on said train of regret
than a bar.

04:51.358 --> 04:53.392
Rule number four,
and this is one of my favorites.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.961
- This is a goody.
- Come back to the house

04:55.963 --> 04:58.630
for a private viewing
of some of the local ballet.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.500
I said no strippers.

05:01.502 --> 05:03.869
That was the one rule I had,
was no strippers.

05:03.871 --> 05:05.537
I lined it up
with a local agency.

05:05.539 --> 05:07.472
Her name is Susan.
I'm sure she's very classy.

05:07.474 --> 05:08.974
- Scotch-Irish, Joe.
- Susie.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.842
- Okay, guys, look.
- She's clean, Joe.

05:10.844 --> 05:13.879
Good. I imagine
they all are clean.

05:13.881 --> 05:15.681
- She's clean, Joe.
- She's super clean.

05:15.683 --> 05:17.049
Yeah. We think.

05:17.051 --> 05:19.785
And rule number five,
the final rule,

05:19.787 --> 05:21.019
the most important rule,

05:21.021 --> 05:23.355
the reason why we're all here:

05:23.357 --> 05:25.724
Wake up feeling so hungover
and guilty

05:25.726 --> 05:27.726
that you never wanna be
a bachelor again,

05:27.728 --> 05:31.396
and thus,
you're ready to be married.

05:33.633 --> 05:35.067
Okay, look.

05:35.069 --> 05:37.035
Guys, I really
just came down here...

05:37.037 --> 05:39.071
- I wanted to tell you...
- No, wait, no, no, no.

05:39.073 --> 05:41.506
Before you get
in any speeches, here.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.075
Come on, here, here, here.

05:43.077 --> 05:45.610
Beer, beer.
Okay, okay, now...

05:45.612 --> 05:46.778
- Yeah.
- Speech.

05:46.780 --> 05:47.979
- I came down...
- Speech, speech!

05:47.981 --> 05:49.614
I came down here
to tell you, guys...

05:49.616 --> 05:51.683
Fuck, what am I talking about?
You're the bachelor.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.518
You can't do it.
It's bad luck.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.587
- I'll do it, I'll do it.
- Yeah, let's do this.

05:55.589 --> 05:57.589
It's a toast.
Come, come, Joe.

05:57.591 --> 05:59.491
Come on, guys, get in here.

05:59.493 --> 06:01.727
Okay, all right.

06:01.729 --> 06:03.428
God, this is awkward.

06:03.430 --> 06:06.565
Okay, so, Joe,
I've always looked up to you.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.033
I think you know that.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.902
You're smart, you're a handsome
son of a bitch.

06:10.904 --> 06:12.604
You've never woken up
next to a fat chick

06:12.606 --> 06:14.639
hitting you because you were
so drunk, you pissed the bed.

06:14.641 --> 06:16.641
- Okay, Nick.
- No, it's okay, it's okay.

06:16.643 --> 06:18.009
I'm in control now.

06:18.011 --> 06:21.046
But before you met Jess,
honestly,

06:21.048 --> 06:23.515
I didn't even know
that love existed.

06:23.517 --> 06:24.983
I really didn't.

06:24.985 --> 06:27.386
And I've never told you this
before either, but...

06:27.388 --> 06:28.920
It wasn't until I saw
what you and Jess had

06:28.922 --> 06:32.057
that I decided to stop drinking,

06:32.059 --> 06:34.159
clean up my life,
find that love for myself

06:34.161 --> 06:36.528
'cause I knew now
that it existed

06:36.530 --> 06:38.430
because of you and Jess.

06:38.432 --> 06:40.065
You inspire me, man.

06:40.067 --> 06:44.436
You and Jess inspire me.
Here's to true love.

06:44.438 --> 06:46.671
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

06:46.673 --> 06:48.607
- Okay, you're up.
- My turn.

06:48.609 --> 06:51.810
Uh, to Joe, to Joe.

06:51.812 --> 06:54.179
Even though getting married
was the...

06:54.181 --> 06:56.181
Worst decision I ever made
in my entire life,

06:56.183 --> 06:59.050
and I hate my ex
more than anything,

06:59.052 --> 07:00.685
- with every fiber my...
- Okay, all right.

07:00.687 --> 07:03.688
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Before you met Jess,

07:03.690 --> 07:07.959
you were very, very lonely,

07:07.961 --> 07:09.594
and you hated casual sex

07:09.596 --> 07:12.731
for some reason that none of us
could ever figure out.

07:12.733 --> 07:16.435
So, yeah, I guess, you know,
marriage, that's the...

07:16.437 --> 07:18.503
That's the right thing
for you to do, so, cheers.

07:18.505 --> 07:21.473
- Cheers. That was nice.

07:21.475 --> 07:22.841
Is that me? Should I?

07:22.843 --> 07:26.978
All right.
All right. Um...

07:26.980 --> 07:29.548
I think you guys know
I don't believe in love.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.983
I certainly don't believe
in weddings, you know,

07:31.985 --> 07:36.021
the idea of families
coming together.

07:42.895 --> 07:45.864
But I do believe in finishing
what you started,

07:45.866 --> 07:51.803
so, you know, you said you're
gonna marry this girl and, uh...

08:07.787 --> 08:10.021
Uh, cheers?

08:10.023 --> 08:12.491
Cheers. Yeah, cheers.

08:12.493 --> 08:16.495
Okay, end of show.
That's you, Joe, Mr. bachelor.

08:16.497 --> 08:18.497
Speech!

08:18.499 --> 08:20.232
Are you guys, done?

08:20.234 --> 08:25.070
Are you done with your little
speeches and your little rules?

08:25.072 --> 08:27.873
- Yeah.
- What's going on, Joe?

08:29.008 --> 08:30.675
I'm not getting married.

08:30.677 --> 08:33.211
- What?
- Are you serious?

08:33.212 --> 08:34.311
Oh, shit.

08:34.313 --> 08:36.948
- It's probably for the best.
- Shut your mouth, Colin.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.250
Oh, fuck it.

08:38.251 --> 08:41.785
- What happened?
- I don't know. I, uh...

08:41.788 --> 08:43.922
I came home today after work.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.056
This happened today?

08:45.058 --> 08:46.858
Yeah, right before
I drove up here.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.026
Oh, fuck.

08:48.028 --> 08:51.663
She was sitting
in the kitchen, crying.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.532
Her...

08:53.534 --> 08:58.036
Her ring was on the table,
and she said...

08:59.872 --> 09:01.540
Um...

09:03.009 --> 09:04.843
She said it was over.

09:04.845 --> 09:07.112
Ouch, dude.

09:08.180 --> 09:09.915
What happened to your hand?

09:09.917 --> 09:12.918
- I punched a hole in the wall.
- You okay?

09:12.920 --> 09:14.286
Yeah.
I don't think it's broken.

09:14.288 --> 09:17.322
No, I mean, you.
Are you okay?

09:17.324 --> 09:20.825
Oh, um, yeah.

09:20.827 --> 09:23.161
Yeah, I think...
I think so.

09:23.163 --> 09:25.063
Maybe it's for the best.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.698
That you found out
that she's a bitch now

09:26.700 --> 09:28.099
and not two weeks from now?

09:28.101 --> 09:30.035
Or before a couple of gremlins
crawled out of her.

09:30.037 --> 09:32.070
Which you have to pay
child support for

09:32.072 --> 09:34.105
when you only get
to see them every two weeks.

09:34.107 --> 09:36.241
You only see your kids
twice a month?

09:36.243 --> 09:38.209
It's a fucking travesty, Nick,
but here's the thing.

09:38.211 --> 09:39.578
I try to look at the positive,

09:39.580 --> 09:41.246
they have soccer games
on the weekends.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.715
I have my boat time.
I don't bring the kids there.

09:43.717 --> 09:46.284
It's dangerous, you know.
There's water. They can't swim.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.186
It's not a safe place
for the kids, no.

09:48.188 --> 09:50.722
But I get to do
bachelor parties though.

09:50.724 --> 09:51.756
That's the one good thing.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.158
Bachelor parties
with my buddies.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.593
- Yeah!
- Oh, shit.

09:54.595 --> 09:56.628
It's not your bachelor party
anymore.

09:56.630 --> 09:58.063
I'm sorry, Joe.

09:59.298 --> 10:02.601
Hey, man, did she
say anything else?

10:02.603 --> 10:05.337
Anything? I mean...

10:05.339 --> 10:07.706
Did she say there was
someone else?

10:09.609 --> 10:11.676
Joe? Joe?

10:14.347 --> 10:16.381
Joe.

10:16.383 --> 10:17.882
- Joe.
- Joe!

10:17.884 --> 10:19.684
This is so fucking bad.

10:19.686 --> 10:21.319
Look, I just came up here
to let you guys know

10:21.321 --> 10:22.954
that the bachelor party's
over, all right?

10:22.956 --> 10:24.255
I'm sorry.
I know that you guys

10:24.257 --> 10:25.957
were really looking forward
to this weekend,

10:25.959 --> 10:29.694
but what I need to do right now
is just figure out my life.

10:29.696 --> 10:30.929
What'd you have in mind?

10:30.931 --> 10:32.931
Well, for starters,
before it closes,

10:32.933 --> 10:34.366
I'm gonna go to Ikea.

10:34.368 --> 10:35.566
- Ikea?
- Yeah.

10:35.568 --> 10:38.036
I don't have anything
to sleep on tonight.

10:38.038 --> 10:39.337
Okay, you just got dumped

10:39.339 --> 10:41.373
two weeks before your wedding,
like garbage,

10:41.375 --> 10:43.174
- and you wanna go to Ikea?
- Yeah, yeah.

10:43.176 --> 10:44.776
I need furniture, you know?

10:44.778 --> 10:46.244
I think you just need
to chill out for a minute.

10:46.246 --> 10:47.779
Took his furniture.
It happened to me.

10:47.781 --> 10:50.181
No, I didn't own any with her.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.150
It was all hers.
And I am chill, all right?

10:52.152 --> 10:55.387
Okay, okay. I can see that
you need furniture.

10:55.389 --> 10:57.689
Why Ikea?

10:57.691 --> 10:58.790
I like Ikea.

10:58.792 --> 10:59.891
Nobody likes Ikea.

10:59.893 --> 11:02.127
I do. I like a lot of Ikea.

11:02.129 --> 11:04.095
I hate those little wrenches.

11:04.097 --> 11:06.331
Oh, yeah, I know.
I swallowed one once.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.799
Never came out.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.401
How the fuck did you do that?

11:09.403 --> 11:14.305
All right, all right,
all right, Joe, wait.

11:14.307 --> 11:15.707
Why Ikea?

11:15.709 --> 11:17.809
Because when I get
something from Ikea,

11:17.811 --> 11:20.211
I know exactly how long
it takes to put it together.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.113
It says right on the box:
3.4 hours to assemble.

11:22.115 --> 11:25.350
I like knowing that for the next
three-point-four hours,

11:25.352 --> 11:30.155
I'm gonna be assembling a brown
brusali with lonset slats,

11:30.157 --> 11:31.823
and a white
stained oak veneer Malm,

11:31.825 --> 11:34.726
or whichever fucking Ikea bed
I'm gonna get today.

11:34.728 --> 11:36.161
Okay.

11:36.163 --> 11:38.730
Maybe before you go,

11:38.732 --> 11:40.732
you'll have one drink with us
at the bar.

11:42.368 --> 11:46.705
It shouldn't take more than
oh-point-four hours.

11:51.178 --> 11:52.977
- Nick, get over here.
- Ow.

11:52.979 --> 11:54.245
- Hey, Colin!
- What are we doing?

11:54.247 --> 11:56.014
Take him. Don't let him go
no matter what.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.716
I got him.
We doing this?

11:57.718 --> 11:59.417
Joe, we don't think
you're telling us the truth.

11:59.419 --> 12:01.419
- I told you what happened.
- Yeah, but...

12:01.421 --> 12:05.023
You didn't tell us
everything that happened.

12:05.025 --> 12:06.491
No.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.259
- Yes.
- Why?

12:08.261 --> 12:10.762
Because you like to tell
most of the truth.

12:10.764 --> 12:12.997
That's not what we want.
That's not what friends do.

12:12.999 --> 12:16.134
We want the whole truth.
Did she fucking cheat on you?

12:16.136 --> 12:18.002
- She fucking cheat?
- She fucking cheat on you, Joe?

12:18.004 --> 12:20.004
No. No!

12:20.006 --> 12:22.407
Careful. I've been drinking.

12:23.442 --> 12:25.844
Did you get him?

12:25.846 --> 12:27.445
I was always better
at this game drunk though.

12:27.447 --> 12:29.180
It got real.

12:29.182 --> 12:30.448
Guys, I don't wanna do this,
all right?

12:30.450 --> 12:32.250
Bullshit you don't
wanna do this.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.886
You drove all the way up here.
For a reason, I think.

12:34.888 --> 12:36.387
Always there to help us,
but when he needs it,

12:36.389 --> 12:37.455
he won't let us help him.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.758
- Exactly, Nick.
- Classic Joe.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.459
How about you tell us what
really happened to the hand?

12:41.461 --> 12:43.294
I told you.
I punched the wall.

12:43.296 --> 12:45.363
Yes, but why?
We've known you since college.

12:45.365 --> 12:48.767
The last thing you would ever do
is resort to senseless violence.

12:48.769 --> 12:50.168
I was mad at her.

12:50.170 --> 12:51.236
This fucking guy.

12:51.238 --> 12:52.771
You don't punch a fucking wall.

12:52.773 --> 12:53.872
Mm-mm.

12:53.874 --> 12:56.407
My fiancée dumped me, all right?

12:56.409 --> 12:59.911
- I was mad at her.
- No, that's wrong.

13:01.081 --> 13:02.914
- Ah, Jesus, man! Fuck!

13:02.916 --> 13:05.383
- Good darts.
- Honestly, I'm just throwing.

13:05.385 --> 13:07.385
Just tell us what you won't
fucking tell us, Joe.

13:07.387 --> 13:08.787
No, it's none of your business.

13:08.789 --> 13:11.055
Oh, so you admit
there is something else?

13:11.057 --> 13:12.924
- Aha.
- Ooh!

13:12.926 --> 13:14.893
We're your friends.
Please.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.060
Let us take care of you.

13:16.062 --> 13:18.163
- Uh, does this count?
- Yeah.

13:18.165 --> 13:19.964
- Yes.
- Yeah.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.900
Tough love, buddy.

13:21.902 --> 13:23.434
Ah.

13:38.984 --> 13:41.853
- Joe?

13:50.930 --> 13:53.531
She's in love with someone else.

14:05.978 --> 14:08.913
- Who is he?
- I don't know.

14:08.915 --> 14:10.348
She said she loves him?

14:10.350 --> 14:12.984
She said that they didn't cheat,
that they just...

14:12.986 --> 14:15.486
Fell in love,
but they didn't have sex.

14:15.488 --> 14:19.357
Well, if they're in love,
then they're not having sex.

14:19.359 --> 14:22.560
They're making love.
Technically.

14:22.562 --> 14:25.129
An emotional affair
is still cheating, Joe.

14:25.131 --> 14:29.901
I don't know. She said that it's
not really about him and her.

14:29.903 --> 14:31.536
It's more about us,
our problems.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.471
Oh, fuck that shit.
I hate that excuse.

14:33.473 --> 14:34.873
God, we should find this guy.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.474
We should kick the shit
out of him.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.376
- Can we do that?
- Teach him a lesson.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.545
- Make you feel a lot better.
- Going to jail?

14:40.547 --> 14:43.214
Who's going to jail?
Why would you go to jail?

14:43.216 --> 14:45.416
Show me a cop in the world
who's gonna put you in jail

14:45.418 --> 14:47.385
for taking the guy
who stole your fiancée

14:47.387 --> 14:49.554
and punching him in the face
like a few hundred times.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.222
- Not gonna happen.
- Never happen.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.491
- No.
- He didn't steal my fiancée.

14:53.493 --> 14:56.427
Oh, my god.
Joe, you can't even admit that?

14:56.429 --> 14:59.063
Come on, man. The guy
totally crossed the line.

14:59.065 --> 15:01.032
What line?

15:01.034 --> 15:03.568
Yeah, what line?
You...

15:03.570 --> 15:05.603
Oh, yeah, I step over it
all the time.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.272
It's very obvious,
in the moment. Here I am.

15:07.274 --> 15:09.574
I'm talking to someone's wife

15:09.576 --> 15:13.578
or fiancée, mother,
and there's an attraction.

15:13.580 --> 15:16.614
And then all of a sudden,
we're sharing energy.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.917
And then there's a line.
There it is.

15:18.919 --> 15:20.518
Oh, that line.
Yeah, I know that line.

15:20.520 --> 15:23.154
And I have a choice.
Do I step over it,

15:23.156 --> 15:24.622
or do I step back?

15:24.624 --> 15:27.558
Guess what this cum stain did.
He stepped right over it.

15:27.560 --> 15:30.461
- He stepped over the line.
- Stomped over the line.

15:30.463 --> 15:32.096
- He stomped it, Joe.
- Like a stallion.

15:32.098 --> 15:36.067
Let me ask you something.
Just hypothetically.

15:36.069 --> 15:39.137
If you could do anything
to teach this guy a lesson,

15:39.139 --> 15:41.306
what'd that be?

15:43.709 --> 15:46.077
- What, anything?
- Mm-hmm.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.615
I'd make him dig his own grave.

15:50.617 --> 15:53.384
You'd make him dig
his own grave? Shit!

15:53.386 --> 15:55.019
That's so dark.

15:55.021 --> 15:58.356
Like in mob movies, right?
When they take a guy out,

15:58.358 --> 15:59.724
they take him
to the woods to kill him,

15:59.726 --> 16:02.460
but they make him
dig his own grave first.

16:02.462 --> 16:05.697
In reality, I mean,
that must take hours, right?

16:05.699 --> 16:07.532
And the whole time
you're digging,

16:07.534 --> 16:10.735
you're just thinking
about what you did

16:10.737 --> 16:13.504
that got you in that situation.

16:13.506 --> 16:16.007
That's genius, man.

16:16.009 --> 16:18.409
Yeah, then you pop that piece of
shit in the back of the head

16:18.411 --> 16:19.510
three times, right?

16:19.512 --> 16:21.479
Blap! Blap! Ra-ta-ta!

16:21.481 --> 16:25.116
I'd probably have to, right?

16:25.118 --> 16:27.318
No, you wouldn't.

16:27.320 --> 16:31.322
No. You just
turn him around, right?

16:31.324 --> 16:34.192
He's sitting there,
he's evacuating his bowels,

16:34.194 --> 16:36.194
looking down into his own grave,

16:36.196 --> 16:38.062
waiting for the lights
to go out,

16:38.064 --> 16:39.664
thinking about what he did.

16:39.666 --> 16:42.100
And then...

16:44.670 --> 16:46.671
You let him go.

16:46.673 --> 16:49.607
Fuck yeah. Dude would never
mess with you again.

16:49.609 --> 16:51.509
- Yeah.
- Oh! You do nothing.

16:51.511 --> 16:52.677
I love it.
It's the ultimate revenge.

16:52.679 --> 16:53.877
You're sick.

16:53.879 --> 16:57.315
Well, how about, uh, you know,
instead of sweet revenge,

16:57.317 --> 17:01.219
next best thing,
some sweet, stanky booze?

17:01.221 --> 17:03.121
Guys, I'm gonna go to that
meeting on Monday, okay?

17:03.123 --> 17:05.056
Or Tuesday.
Wednesday at the very latest.

17:05.058 --> 17:06.590
No, no, no, you're off leash.

17:06.593 --> 17:08.693
- It's Joe's bachelor party.
- No, no.

17:08.694 --> 17:11.095
It's not my bachelor party
anymore.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.701
Rude.

17:16.703 --> 17:19.470
Okay, so it's not the end
of your bachelorhood.

17:19.472 --> 17:21.439
We can call it
whatever we want with you,

17:21.441 --> 17:23.407
it's a celebration
of its rebirth.

17:23.410 --> 17:24.742
That's exactly what he needs.
I'm in.

17:24.743 --> 17:27.145
- Me too.
- This is a rebirth of Joe.

17:27.146 --> 17:29.781
Come on, Joe.

17:29.783 --> 17:33.651
- Come on in, it's warm.
- Join us.

17:33.653 --> 17:34.552
Fuck it.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.320
- Hey!
- Yes!

17:41.293 --> 17:43.728
Oh, ho! Ah!

17:43.730 --> 17:47.098
Oh, my god, I feel alive again.
I feel alive!

18:17.330 --> 18:19.730
Susan!

18:42.187 --> 18:45.823
Okay, Joe.
Susan's here for you, man.

18:45.825 --> 18:50.461
It's time to take all that anger
and disappointment and sadness

18:50.463 --> 18:53.564
and get it off your chest,
and just...

18:53.566 --> 18:55.399
Just spray it on hers.

18:55.401 --> 18:57.435
No. No, I'm not gonna do that.

18:57.437 --> 19:00.838
Okay.
Well, just the lap dance.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.673
Okay.

19:13.286 --> 19:15.786
Aah! Whoo!

19:29.502 --> 19:31.022
- I can do this.
- Do it, do it, do it!

19:44.316 --> 19:45.917
One.

19:57.729 --> 19:59.197
Two.

20:06.738 --> 20:08.206
- Three.

20:24.489 --> 20:26.757
- Yeah!

20:36.335 --> 20:38.336
Got his hair.

20:38.338 --> 20:40.338
Okay, you got his hair?

20:40.340 --> 20:41.806
I did it!

21:43.703 --> 21:45.970
Fuck, man!

21:48.573 --> 21:50.308
What are you doing in here?

21:50.310 --> 21:51.976
The whites.

21:56.682 --> 21:58.749
Fucking weirdo.

22:03.388 --> 22:06.324
Hey, did you hear that?

22:06.326 --> 22:07.324
No.

22:07.326 --> 22:10.528
I thought I heard some
banging in the basement.

22:10.530 --> 22:11.862
Any banging in this house

22:11.864 --> 22:13.998
is probably Colin
and that stripper.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.100
Susan.

22:16.102 --> 22:18.836
- How's your ass?
- Ah.

22:21.106 --> 22:22.873
Have you seen a stripper
do that before?

22:22.875 --> 22:25.409
I have.
When I was four.

22:29.349 --> 22:31.615
- Oh!
- Fantastic.

22:31.617 --> 22:34.385
Nick. Nick!

22:34.387 --> 22:35.753
What?

22:35.755 --> 22:39.523
Why didn't you puke
in your bathroom?

22:39.525 --> 22:40.691
Wha... I puked?

22:40.693 --> 22:42.560
In the sink.

22:42.562 --> 22:44.628
Oh, shit.

22:44.630 --> 22:47.131
I'm just waking up right now,
like this very second.

22:47.133 --> 22:49.667
Well, good morning.
You just puked in the sink.

22:49.669 --> 22:51.936
Clean it up.
Hell no.

22:51.938 --> 22:53.771
No.

22:55.775 --> 22:58.376
Nick, do you know if Colin
slept in the basement?

22:58.378 --> 23:00.478
There's a basement?

23:00.480 --> 23:01.946
Speak of the devil.

23:10.455 --> 23:12.523
Damn.

23:12.525 --> 23:15.826
Oh, it's up in my sinuses.

23:21.533 --> 23:24.435
Oh, that's fucked up.

23:33.745 --> 23:35.946
- How much did that cost you?
- Hmm?

23:35.948 --> 23:37.715
How much did you
pay that woman for sex?

23:37.717 --> 23:42.052
No, we paid crystal to dance.
She chose to stay the night.

23:43.556 --> 23:45.122
Crystal?

23:45.124 --> 23:47.958
Yeah. Susan is just
her stripper name.

23:47.960 --> 23:50.494
That's good misdirection.

23:50.496 --> 23:51.829
Grande Starbucks.

23:51.831 --> 23:53.798
Actually, it's a medium.

23:56.668 --> 23:58.769
You've been out.

24:00.705 --> 24:02.840
Yup. Had some errands to run.

24:02.842 --> 24:06.977
Oh, you fixing cars or...

24:06.979 --> 24:08.813
Oh, are you talking
about my outfit?

24:08.815 --> 24:11.816
I like the way
it feels against my skin.

24:13.218 --> 24:17.555
This trail of mud
seems a bit... suspicious.

24:17.557 --> 24:20.558
Oh, you're just a real
Benedict Cumberbatch.

24:20.560 --> 24:23.594
- God bless the BBC.
- He's hiding something.

24:23.596 --> 24:24.862
No, I'm not.

24:24.864 --> 24:27.598
- We know you can't be trusted.
- Yeah.

24:27.600 --> 24:30.000
Like that time you replaced
all my shampoo with Nair.

24:30.002 --> 24:31.202
That was hilarious.

24:31.204 --> 24:32.636
All of my hair fell out.

24:32.638 --> 24:34.138
That was the hilarious part.

24:34.140 --> 24:36.807
Nick, it was unfortunate,
but he's right.

24:36.809 --> 24:39.577
It was fucking hilarious!

24:39.579 --> 24:40.578
Ha ha.

24:40.580 --> 24:42.146
This guy gets it.

24:42.148 --> 24:46.917
Still, it proves
you can't be trusted.

24:47.853 --> 24:49.887
He is hiding something.

24:49.889 --> 24:51.055
There was a loud crash
in the basement.

24:51.057 --> 24:54.492
What? Dude, you're...

24:59.064 --> 25:01.565
What are you hiding, Erik?

25:03.602 --> 25:05.769
Should we get the darts?

25:05.771 --> 25:07.505
I got a surprise for you.

25:13.613 --> 25:15.079
What is in the basement?

25:15.081 --> 25:17.515
I think you're really
gonna like this.

25:17.517 --> 25:19.250
- It might be Nair, dude.
- It's not Nair, Nick.

25:19.252 --> 25:22.786
I'm just saying.
I'm not going down there.

26:26.685 --> 26:29.086
What the fuck?

26:35.694 --> 26:36.694
Do you love it?

26:40.165 --> 26:43.334
There's somebody
tied up down here.

26:44.804 --> 26:46.971
I'm sorry he's so muddy.

26:46.973 --> 26:50.741
He tried to run,
and he fell by the lake.

26:50.743 --> 26:52.042
I didn't do this.

26:52.044 --> 26:54.979
I left him in
a more presentable position.

26:54.981 --> 26:56.614
Oh, he's a big boy.

26:57.616 --> 27:00.818
Erik, who is that?

27:00.820 --> 27:01.986
It's the guy.

27:02.989 --> 27:04.989
It's the fucking guy.

27:04.991 --> 27:08.258
- Oh, my god.
- What guy?

27:08.260 --> 27:09.827
He's finally done it.

27:09.829 --> 27:11.695
Wait, he...
What has he done?

27:11.697 --> 27:12.830
It's him.

27:12.832 --> 27:14.231
You fucked us all.

27:14.233 --> 27:16.000
Huh? What?

27:16.002 --> 27:18.202
The point is we got him.
He's tied up.

27:18.204 --> 27:21.672
He's not so fucking tall now,
is he? Is he?

27:22.842 --> 27:24.208
What?

27:31.716 --> 27:33.117
Happy bachelor party.

27:37.122 --> 27:39.957
- Is he okay?
- I don't know. Joe.

27:39.959 --> 27:42.226
Something's wrong with him.

27:42.228 --> 27:43.861
Joe.

27:49.234 --> 27:51.301
What's wrong with you?

27:51.303 --> 27:52.936
What's wrong with me?

27:52.938 --> 27:54.171
Yeah, I'm trying to help you.

27:54.173 --> 27:56.073
I'm a little bit lost.
Who is that?

27:56.075 --> 27:59.410
You think kidnapping
the guy who stole my fiancée

27:59.412 --> 28:00.310
is gonna help me?

28:00.312 --> 28:02.680
- Oh, shit.
- Yes!

28:02.682 --> 28:04.748
Dude, it's gonna make you
feel so much better

28:04.750 --> 28:07.084
knowing that this asshole
paid for what he did.

28:07.086 --> 28:09.286
So now I'm supposed to go down
there and beat him with an oar?

28:09.288 --> 28:11.188
Or maybe waterboard him
for a bit?

28:11.190 --> 28:12.756
Those sound like great options.

28:12.758 --> 28:14.958
You fucking kidnapped someone!

28:14.960 --> 28:16.293
I know!

28:17.696 --> 28:19.296
You're welcome?

28:20.298 --> 28:22.099
Hey, man, how did you
kidnap that guy?

28:22.101 --> 28:23.267
Oh, dude, I'm glad you asked.

28:23.269 --> 28:24.968
It was actually easier
than I thought.

28:24.970 --> 28:26.437
First, I called Kelly.

28:26.439 --> 28:28.472
Jess, his best friend,
would know what's going on.

28:28.474 --> 28:30.874
- How's her juice business?
- I don't know. I didn't ask.

28:30.876 --> 28:32.810
She's terrible with secrets
as you all know,

28:32.812 --> 28:34.812
so it didn't take her long
to tell me where to find him.

28:34.814 --> 28:36.346
You have to be the biggest...

28:36.348 --> 28:39.149
Your place.

28:39.151 --> 28:41.385
- Boom.
- I knocked on your door.

28:41.387 --> 28:44.121
This grease ball answered.
I tied him up.

28:44.123 --> 28:45.389
What about...

28:45.391 --> 28:49.293
Oh, uh, sent Jess a text
with his phone.

28:49.295 --> 28:51.729
"Sorry, I had to leave.
My hemorrhoids are killing me."

28:51.731 --> 28:52.729
It works.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.064
- Let me see that.
- No.

28:54.066 --> 28:55.766
No, man, trust me.

28:55.768 --> 28:57.334
You don't want to see the things
they've been texting.

28:57.336 --> 28:59.503
- Sexting.
- It's more about sunsets.

28:59.505 --> 29:00.703
It's revolting.

29:00.705 --> 29:04.141
Okay. Help me out here.
I'm trying to piece it together.

29:04.143 --> 29:05.309
Yeah, yeah, shoot.

29:05.311 --> 29:06.977
Guy's kind of a big guy.

29:06.979 --> 29:09.279
- Yeah, he's huge.
- He just let you tie him up.

29:09.281 --> 29:12.316
Oh, no.
Dude, I had this mask on.

29:12.318 --> 29:13.450
So?

29:13.452 --> 29:15.385
So then I also had my dad's gun.

29:15.387 --> 29:17.121
- What the hell?
- That helped.

29:17.123 --> 29:18.255
Fuck! No, don't!

29:18.257 --> 29:20.891
- That helped.
- Oh, great.

29:20.893 --> 29:22.092
That's really funny.

29:22.094 --> 29:23.861
Cool down with that thing, man!

29:23.863 --> 29:25.763
For armed kidnapping,
that's another ten years.

29:25.765 --> 29:28.165
Fucking great, Erik.
You've really done it this time.

29:28.167 --> 29:31.168
Someone's gonna have to use
my chloroform.

29:33.004 --> 29:35.072
Why do you have chloroform?

29:35.074 --> 29:37.241
Most people have chloroform.

29:38.309 --> 29:40.477
You're a scary person.
Seriously.

29:40.479 --> 29:42.312
Well, great. Looks like
we're stuck cleaning up

29:42.314 --> 29:44.314
another one of Erik's messes.

29:44.316 --> 29:46.016
I think we need
to think about it.

29:46.018 --> 29:48.952
I think we need to be
very careful on our next move.

29:48.954 --> 29:50.354
What happens we let the guy go?

29:50.356 --> 29:54.057
The guy squeals to the cops,
Erik goes to jail.

29:54.059 --> 29:56.493
- Good.
- Flipside of that coin.

29:56.495 --> 29:58.362
We don't untie him,
we're all accomplices,

29:58.364 --> 29:59.797
and we all go to jail.

29:59.799 --> 30:01.198
No one is going to jail!

30:01.200 --> 30:02.432
How do you know?

30:02.434 --> 30:04.468
Dude, nobody's
going to the cops!

30:10.408 --> 30:11.809
Not it.

30:11.811 --> 30:13.177
What? No.

30:13.179 --> 30:15.479
No, you can't do that
in this situation.

30:16.882 --> 30:18.015
Yes, coming, coming.

30:18.017 --> 30:19.082
- Joe.
- I'm sorry.

30:19.084 --> 30:21.351
Talk to the cop, Joe.

30:21.353 --> 30:24.555
Put your fucking thumbs down.
You're coming with me.

30:24.557 --> 30:26.223
- Do it.
- He's got yellow glasses.

30:26.225 --> 30:28.592
Put your thumbs down!
Calm down. Just be calm.

30:28.594 --> 30:30.360
Dude, they're fucking
shooting glasses.

30:32.997 --> 30:34.231
Morning, officer.

30:34.233 --> 30:36.233
Good afternoon, son.

30:37.502 --> 30:40.304
Oh, I'm sorry,
is is that late already?

30:40.306 --> 30:42.239
Boys having some kind
of a party here?

30:42.241 --> 30:44.842
No. I mean, yeah, sort of.

30:44.844 --> 30:47.144
I mean, it's not
a party-party.

30:47.146 --> 30:48.478
Which is it?

30:48.480 --> 30:51.215
Uh...

30:51.217 --> 30:52.449
It's his bachelor party, sir.

30:52.451 --> 30:55.185
No. No, it's not.
Not, not really.

30:55.187 --> 31:00.324
No, it's really just four guys
hanging out for the weekend.

31:00.326 --> 31:03.327
Just one, two, three, four.

31:07.165 --> 31:08.565
No one else, huh?

31:08.567 --> 31:11.935
No. No.

31:11.937 --> 31:12.937
No.

31:18.576 --> 31:21.411
We got a call about a woman
in disarray of dress

31:21.413 --> 31:23.080
leaving this residence earlier.

31:23.082 --> 31:25.048
Oh, yeah. Crystal... Susan.

31:25.050 --> 31:27.217
- Crystal Susan?
- Crystal Susan.

31:27.219 --> 31:29.953
- Crystal Susan.
- Crystal-Susan.

31:31.222 --> 31:32.556
It's a hyphenate.

31:32.558 --> 31:34.024
So that's an affirmative?

31:34.026 --> 31:35.926
Yes.

31:35.928 --> 31:37.294
Yeah, affirmative, affirmative.

31:37.296 --> 31:39.263
You do realize that prostitution

31:39.265 --> 31:40.964
is illegal in big bear.

31:40.966 --> 31:44.568
Affirmative. Crystal-Susan
is a law student.

31:44.570 --> 31:48.572
Actually, she overslept for
a law test on legal distress.

31:48.574 --> 31:52.175
That's why she left
in disarray...

31:52.177 --> 31:54.177
Of dress.

31:54.179 --> 31:55.612
Yup.

31:58.683 --> 32:00.183
You have a medical
marijuana card

32:00.185 --> 32:02.052
from the state of California?

32:02.054 --> 32:03.320
No.

32:05.256 --> 32:07.457
Well, if I hear of anybody

32:07.459 --> 32:10.193
using medical marijuana
for recreational purposes,

32:10.195 --> 32:13.163
do you know the first place
that I'm gonna come?

32:13.165 --> 32:14.331
Here?

32:14.333 --> 32:16.099
Bright boy, bright boy.

32:16.101 --> 32:17.234
Look at him go.

32:17.236 --> 32:19.970
I got my eye on you four.

32:19.972 --> 32:23.340
One, two, three...

32:25.510 --> 32:26.710
Four.

32:40.224 --> 32:42.292
Well, that was weird.

32:42.294 --> 32:43.427
I'm letting him go.

32:43.429 --> 32:45.062
Wait, wait, wait, listen.

32:45.064 --> 32:48.231
If we make him realize
that he deserves what he gets,

32:48.233 --> 32:49.633
he's not going to the cops.

32:49.635 --> 32:51.635
You thought that
you'd kidnap this guy,

32:51.637 --> 32:54.237
beat him up, and then he'd say,
"yeah, I deserved that."

32:54.239 --> 32:56.306
Yeah, that's about right.

32:56.308 --> 32:58.108
Is this just a joke to you?

32:58.110 --> 33:01.979
No. It's not a joke.

33:01.981 --> 33:03.313
Wha...

33:04.449 --> 33:06.283
Do not untie him!

33:23.267 --> 33:27.337
I'm gonna... I'm gonna come
take the tape off now.

33:38.217 --> 33:39.716
Oh, it's really stuck on there.

33:39.718 --> 33:42.019
Oh, it's really stuck.

33:42.021 --> 33:44.254
I can't understand you.
There's tape on your face.

33:44.256 --> 33:47.591
Rip it fast.

33:47.593 --> 33:48.725
Oh.

33:48.727 --> 33:50.160
Fuck!

33:50.162 --> 33:51.695
Why would you rip it so slow?

33:51.697 --> 33:53.463
I don't know.
I've never done it before.

33:53.465 --> 33:55.499
- You took off part of my lip.
- I'm sorry.

33:55.501 --> 33:57.367
You should be.

33:59.170 --> 34:02.639
Look, I don't know
what any of this is about.

34:02.641 --> 34:05.308
You don't know who I am?

34:05.310 --> 34:08.311
Uh, no. Should I?

34:08.313 --> 34:10.746
Well, you're wearing
my fucking robe.

34:12.750 --> 34:15.217
Oh.

34:15.219 --> 34:16.386
You're Joe.

34:16.388 --> 34:18.455
You're laughing.

34:18.456 --> 34:21.324
- No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- You're clearly laughing.

34:21.326 --> 34:22.726
- I'm sorry. I'm not laughing.
- It's not funny.

34:22.728 --> 34:25.562
I know it's not.
I'm just...

34:25.563 --> 34:27.330
- I'm relieved.
- Relieved?

34:27.331 --> 34:29.766
Yeah. I thought
it was work-related.

34:29.768 --> 34:32.601
- What do you do for work?
- I'm in corporate takeovers.

34:32.603 --> 34:34.603
Some people take it
very personally.

34:34.606 --> 34:37.774
The guy who stole my fiancée
is in corporate takeovers?

34:37.775 --> 34:40.577
- It's an honest living.
- Okay, but you're still tied up

34:40.579 --> 34:42.411
in a scary basement in big bear.

34:42.414 --> 34:44.181
Oh, I love big bear.

34:44.183 --> 34:49.719
But yeah, this is...
I don't think... you know?

34:49.721 --> 34:52.755
Look, Joe, I'm really sorry

34:52.757 --> 34:56.693
about what happened
between you and Jess,

34:56.695 --> 35:00.664
but you can untie me now.

35:00.666 --> 35:03.333
I'm gonna untie you, all right?
But before I do that,

35:03.335 --> 35:05.869
I just want you to agree
that this was a stupid mistake.

35:05.871 --> 35:09.139
Oh, agreed.

35:09.141 --> 35:12.509
And I just need you to say that
you're not gonna go to the cops.

35:14.779 --> 35:16.646
I'm sorry.

35:16.648 --> 35:19.483
No, you can't just take somebody

35:19.485 --> 35:21.151
and expect not to pay
the consequences.

35:21.153 --> 35:23.286
Kind of like how you
just took my fiancée?

35:23.288 --> 35:27.257
Oh, like what you did there.
But no, it's not the same thing.

35:27.259 --> 35:30.193
- It's not?
- No. I didn't break any laws.

35:30.195 --> 35:32.762
The basic tenets of almost
every law ever written...

35:32.764 --> 35:34.331
The ten fucking commandments...

35:34.333 --> 35:36.566
Say you can't take
someone else's girl.

35:36.568 --> 35:38.168
Actually,
that's your neighbor's wife,

35:38.170 --> 35:43.740
and, technically, you guys
weren't married yet.

35:44.642 --> 35:46.343
Who the fuck are you?

35:46.345 --> 35:50.380
Look, Joe, I actually played a
very small part in your breakup.

35:50.382 --> 35:51.681
- Really?
- Yeah.

35:51.683 --> 35:53.884
You guys have a lot of issues.

35:53.886 --> 35:57.287
Oh, we do? Do tell.
I'd love to hear them.

35:57.289 --> 35:58.522
- Would you?
- Yeah.

35:58.524 --> 36:02.626
Okay. Well, shit.
I mean, uh...

36:02.628 --> 36:04.728
For instance, you...

36:04.730 --> 36:06.830
You hated her family.

36:08.533 --> 36:09.833
I didn't hate her family.

36:09.835 --> 36:11.568
You didn't go on the ski trip
last year.

36:11.570 --> 36:13.236
That really hurt
Jess's feelings.

36:13.238 --> 36:15.705
I didn't go 'cause her dad
was gonna be there and...

36:15.707 --> 36:17.407
Wait, how do you know all this?

36:17.409 --> 36:19.843
That's right.
You're scared of her father.

36:19.845 --> 36:21.678
I am not scared of her dad.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.647
- You're not?
- No.

36:23.649 --> 36:25.282
- You sure?
- Yes.

36:25.284 --> 36:27.250
Really?

36:27.252 --> 36:28.785
Fuck you.

36:30.755 --> 36:34.224
Hey, wait, you didn't
untie me. Joe!

36:36.260 --> 36:37.327
Hello?

36:39.598 --> 36:41.331
What are you guys doing?

36:41.333 --> 36:42.699
- Huh?
- Hey. Nothing, man.

36:42.701 --> 36:44.401
- Did you untie him?
- Dude, what happened?

36:44.403 --> 36:46.469
What going on? Hey.

36:46.471 --> 36:48.872
- Um...
- Did you untie him?

36:48.874 --> 36:49.873
No, not yet.

36:49.875 --> 36:51.841
- Good.
- Can I have this beer?

36:51.843 --> 36:54.477
Yeah, if you like drinking
in the morning, go for it.

36:54.479 --> 36:56.980
He's kinda cocky.

36:56.982 --> 37:00.283
Okay! So let's teach this cocky
motherfucker some respect.

37:02.286 --> 37:04.521
Fuck. Hold on.

37:04.523 --> 37:06.323
I'll get that.

37:06.325 --> 37:07.557
- Be mean!
- Go, Joe!

37:07.559 --> 37:08.625
Go get him, Joe.

37:08.627 --> 37:10.227
Come on, let's do this.

37:10.229 --> 37:12.629
Just a little.

37:12.631 --> 37:14.764
All right, ready?

37:14.766 --> 37:18.235
What was it, end of the lips
and over your gums?

37:19.003 --> 37:21.271
Look, when I asked
for his blessing

37:21.273 --> 37:23.340
to marry his daughter,
he said no.

37:23.342 --> 37:26.243
Ooh. I could understand why
you'd be afraid of him then.

37:26.245 --> 37:31.314
Exactly. No, I'm not...
He's a very traditional man,

37:31.316 --> 37:32.949
so I thought if I asked
for his blessing,

37:32.951 --> 37:35.518
he might finally
show me some respect.

37:35.520 --> 37:38.288
Why did he say no?

37:38.290 --> 37:41.558
He said that if we got married,
we'd have a hard time

37:41.560 --> 37:43.660
because I don't make
enough money.

37:43.662 --> 37:46.997
Hmm. How much did you
pull in last year?

37:46.999 --> 37:48.598
75, 80k?

37:48.600 --> 37:49.966
What?

37:49.968 --> 37:51.868
Fifty? Sixty?

37:53.537 --> 37:56.273
Less? Thirty? Joe!

37:56.275 --> 37:59.409
I had a really rough year
last year, okay?

37:59.411 --> 38:01.411
- It wasn't normal.
- That's right. You got demoted.

38:01.413 --> 38:03.980
Exactly! Yeah, for reasons
out of my control.

38:03.982 --> 38:06.383
Your boss promoted his
unqualified nephew or something.

38:06.385 --> 38:09.486
Yes. He had never even
worked in our division.

38:09.488 --> 38:10.787
How do you know all that?

38:10.789 --> 38:12.289
How could you let that
happen though?

38:12.291 --> 38:15.325
- No, I didn't let it happen.
- Yeah.

38:15.327 --> 38:18.995
- Either that or get fired.
- So get fired or, shit, quit.

38:18.997 --> 38:21.831
- If it's respect that you want.
- I want money.

38:21.833 --> 38:23.300
That was the whole thing.

38:23.302 --> 38:25.702
I needed the money
to have a good marriage

38:25.704 --> 38:27.470
so that I could get respect,
I thought.

38:27.472 --> 38:30.073
Look, Joe, I think Jess's dad
might've been right.

38:30.075 --> 38:33.410
You can't support a family
on an income like that.

38:33.412 --> 38:35.845
Half of marriages end
because of money problems.

38:35.847 --> 38:37.981
And the other half end
because of infidelity.

38:37.983 --> 38:41.551
- Whoa.
- Oh, right, right.

38:41.553 --> 38:45.455
You haven't slept with Jess.

38:45.457 --> 38:47.390
Yet.

38:47.392 --> 38:49.592
Why you just untie me

38:49.594 --> 38:53.897
before you do something you're
really gonna end up regretting?

39:07.011 --> 39:08.778
You're smarter than this, Joe.

39:08.780 --> 39:12.048
You need to wise up.

39:12.050 --> 39:15.418
You know, you can't go around
doing shit like this.

39:35.973 --> 39:39.008
- I guess I just did.

39:42.513 --> 39:43.913
Fuck!

39:43.915 --> 39:46.082
- Chop it up real fine.
- Make 'em a little fatter.

39:46.084 --> 39:48.685
- Where'd you get this shit?
- It's one of Mike's items.

39:48.687 --> 39:50.954
Oh, Mike.
Man, this is a good shit.

39:50.956 --> 39:52.455
Make 'em fat, make 'em big.

39:52.457 --> 39:54.657
Shut up. I know what I'm doing.

39:54.659 --> 39:56.659
Fuck that guy!

39:56.661 --> 39:58.395
Fuck yeah!

39:58.397 --> 39:59.695
Now do you see?

39:59.697 --> 40:01.798
Somehow that guy knows
everything about me.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.533
- He knows everything about you.
- He does.

40:03.535 --> 40:04.968
That's what these guys do.

40:04.970 --> 40:07.070
They get the information,
they get the girl to vent,

40:07.072 --> 40:09.439
start purging about
the boyfriend.

40:09.441 --> 40:10.740
She told him everything.

40:10.742 --> 40:12.542
- Told him everything about you.
- Fuck.

40:12.544 --> 40:15.044
- He flipped it on me.
- He flipped it on you.

40:15.046 --> 40:16.713
He fucking flipped it on you!

40:16.715 --> 40:18.548
- Fuck that guy.
- Fuck that guy!

40:18.550 --> 40:19.949
Except in this case,

40:19.951 --> 40:22.652
he got the fiancée to fucking
break up with the fiancé

40:22.654 --> 40:24.721
two weeks before
the fucking wedding!

40:24.723 --> 40:27.056
- Fuck it.
- Yeah.

40:27.058 --> 40:29.959
- Told you it was good shit.
- Is that my credit card?

40:29.961 --> 40:33.696
Where? Oh, is this...

40:33.698 --> 40:34.798
Yeah, I think that's yours.

40:34.800 --> 40:36.766
Listen, we have a problem.

40:36.768 --> 40:37.834
Yeah, I know.

40:37.836 --> 40:39.469
We're all accomplices now.

40:39.471 --> 40:40.603
Good for you.

40:40.605 --> 40:42.071
No, we have a bigger problem.

40:42.073 --> 40:43.907
Jess won't stop calling.

40:46.510 --> 40:47.811
Really?

40:50.214 --> 40:54.551
Oh, okay, I got it.
Here's what you do. You say,

40:54.553 --> 40:56.920
"hey, sorry I didn't get back
to your texts or phone calls.

40:56.922 --> 40:58.521
Just got out of the er.

40:58.523 --> 41:00.457
My hemorrhoids are still
bleeding all over the place."

41:00.459 --> 41:02.759
- Oh, gross.
- That's the OG story.

41:02.761 --> 41:04.727
You gotta stick to it, man.

41:04.729 --> 41:06.696
She's really worried
about him, huh?

41:06.698 --> 41:08.164
Who cares? Let her worry.

41:08.166 --> 41:10.800
Nope. Tell her something
that'll get her to chill out.

41:10.802 --> 41:13.470
This is your fault
for not moving his car.

41:13.472 --> 41:16.172
I'm sorry. I'm gonna kidnap him
and valet his car?

41:16.174 --> 41:18.475
Didn't think about that,
did you, genius?

41:18.477 --> 41:20.810
You know what? Why don't you say
"I'm sorry. My car didn't start,

41:20.812 --> 41:22.479
so I took a cab
to my apartment."

41:22.481 --> 41:23.813
- That's good.
- What if he has a house?

41:23.815 --> 41:25.748
Your kids don't love you.

41:25.750 --> 41:26.883
Sorry. I didn't mean that.

41:26.885 --> 41:29.886
Say "I took a cab to my place."

41:29.888 --> 41:32.622
- She said he left his wallet.
- Goddamn it!

41:32.624 --> 41:36.526
I'm sorry I didn't have time to
gather his personal belongings.

41:37.829 --> 41:41.197
Shit. She's gonna call the cops.

41:41.199 --> 41:42.899
Fuck.

41:45.036 --> 41:46.536
I need your help.

41:46.538 --> 41:48.938
Fuck you.

41:48.940 --> 41:52.509
I just need you to tell me
what to text Jess

41:52.511 --> 41:54.611
that's gonna get her
to calm down.

41:54.613 --> 41:55.612
Fuck you.

41:55.614 --> 41:56.779
Okay, all right.

41:56.781 --> 41:59.115
I'll take the tape off.

42:06.056 --> 42:10.660
I know, I know. Rip it fast.

42:11.930 --> 42:14.797
That is strong duct tape.

42:14.799 --> 42:17.033
Come on.
What should I tell her?

42:17.035 --> 42:19.035
Tell her I'm tied up
in a basement in big bear

42:19.037 --> 42:21.638
- and to send the police.
- Seriously.

42:21.640 --> 42:23.907
Seriously?
Why the fuck would I help you?

42:23.909 --> 42:26.543
Because I'm gonna
take you back to la,

42:26.545 --> 42:28.177
but it's gonna be
a lot more difficult

42:28.179 --> 42:31.014
if Jess goes on one of
her patented freak-outs first.

42:31.016 --> 42:33.082
I help you,
you're gonna take me back?

42:33.084 --> 42:36.553
- I promise.
- Untie me first.

42:36.555 --> 42:38.021
After.

42:41.659 --> 42:46.229
Tell her I'm sorry
that I disappeared.

42:46.231 --> 42:49.599
Melanie came and picked me up.

42:49.601 --> 42:52.268
Who's Melanie?

42:52.270 --> 42:53.970
My wife.

42:58.143 --> 42:59.042
What?

42:59.044 --> 43:00.577
Soon to be ex-wife.

43:00.579 --> 43:02.111
- You're married?
- Yeah, but...

43:02.113 --> 43:06.215
You cheated on your wife
with my fiancée?

43:06.217 --> 43:07.850
- Well...
- An emotional affair

43:07.852 --> 43:09.152
is still crossing the line.

43:09.154 --> 43:11.254
- What line?
- The line that you cross

43:11.256 --> 43:12.855
when you're sharing energy
with someone.

43:12.857 --> 43:15.158
- What?
- The fucking line you cross

43:15.160 --> 43:16.960
when you're doing
something wrong!

43:16.962 --> 43:18.728
But I guess you don't
see it that way

43:18.730 --> 43:21.097
because you didn't bring your
dick across the line with you.

43:23.701 --> 43:25.034
This better work.

43:27.771 --> 43:29.305
Asshole.

43:35.613 --> 43:38.615
Well? Did it work?

43:39.883 --> 43:41.918
You guys use emojis?

43:41.920 --> 43:44.020
What the fuck are emojis?

43:44.022 --> 43:47.890
These. Stupid fucking
smiley faces and shit.

43:47.892 --> 43:49.626
Yeah. Jess likes them.
So what?

43:49.628 --> 43:51.227
Yeah, I know.
I hate 'em.

43:51.229 --> 43:53.896
Told her I won't text her back
if she used them.

43:53.898 --> 43:55.632
- Why?
- Because they're stupid.

43:55.634 --> 43:56.636
They're childish.

43:56.638 --> 43:58.334
If you're gonna say something,
say it in words.

43:58.336 --> 44:00.203
- Yeah, but who cares?
- I do.

44:00.205 --> 44:02.005
She likes them. So what?
That's her thing.

44:02.007 --> 44:04.907
I mean, you think it's important
enough to fight about it?

44:04.909 --> 44:07.210
I don't need your stellar
relationship counseling.

44:07.212 --> 44:09.278
- Okay, professor love?
- Well, maybe you do.

44:09.280 --> 44:12.115
You've already done a whopper
on my now previous engagement.

44:12.117 --> 44:14.784
- You came asking for my advice.

44:16.920 --> 44:17.920
Mmm!

44:17.922 --> 44:20.990
Strong tape, strong tape.

44:26.697 --> 44:29.032
- Too tight?
- Yeah, wait, hold on.

44:29.034 --> 44:31.801
- Why are we tying me up again?
- So you don't hurt yourself.

44:31.803 --> 44:34.070
I don't think it's necessary.
Ah, fuck, man!

44:34.072 --> 44:35.438
All right.

44:35.440 --> 44:37.040
- You'll thank me.
- Yeah, you're right.

44:37.042 --> 44:39.208
- Why is Nick tied to...

44:40.811 --> 44:42.345
What is she doing here?

44:42.347 --> 44:45.114
Okay, Joe, it's cool.
She's here to help with Jess.

44:45.116 --> 44:47.784
What? You told her?

44:47.786 --> 44:51.387
Joe, crystal-Susan is a lady.
She understands ladies.

44:51.389 --> 44:56.325
Okay, I'm sorry, crystal-Susan,
but it's already taken care of.

44:56.327 --> 45:00.196
Oh, I was just trying
to help, so...

45:00.198 --> 45:03.833
Joe, crystal-Susan
is here to help, okay?

45:03.835 --> 45:05.101
Please, take it easy.

45:05.103 --> 45:06.703
It seems like she's here
for you.

45:06.705 --> 45:08.037
Well...

45:08.039 --> 45:09.405
- Are you?
- Yeah.

45:09.407 --> 45:11.808
- Are you really?
- Yeah, why not?

45:11.810 --> 45:13.342
At least I think so.

45:13.344 --> 45:15.311
Why is Nick tied to a chair?

45:15.313 --> 45:17.380
Oh, I got such a good idea.

45:17.382 --> 45:19.415
- But it's dangerous.
- It's not dangerous.

45:19.417 --> 45:21.084
- Okay, is it dangerous?
- Perfectly safe.

45:21.086 --> 45:22.719
- It'll kill him.
- What?

45:22.721 --> 45:24.320
Colin, shut up.
Nick, you're gonna be fine.

45:24.322 --> 45:25.955
Joe, we gotta
teach this guy a lesson.

45:25.957 --> 45:28.057
It is the only way to make sure
he doesn't squeal.

45:28.059 --> 45:31.260
- I think I'm out.
- Now, nobody here

45:31.262 --> 45:33.229
is talking about
permanently hurting,

45:33.231 --> 45:36.332
wouldn't do that.
Just talking about a little dose

45:36.334 --> 45:39.435
of very healthy,
very safe revenge.

45:39.437 --> 45:40.837
Like what exactly?

45:40.839 --> 45:42.338
Okay, I don't think
it would be too much

45:42.340 --> 45:44.407
to tie a car battery
to his nipples.

45:44.409 --> 45:47.276
- What? No, no. Is that safe?
- No.

45:47.278 --> 45:49.378
- I'm gonna test it on Nick.
- Untie me.

45:49.380 --> 45:51.013
I say we pull out some teeth.

45:51.015 --> 45:52.849
I think that would be permanent.

45:52.851 --> 45:54.083
I think we should untie me.

45:54.085 --> 45:55.485
Then we'll get his fingernails.

45:55.487 --> 45:57.320
- Fingernails grow back.
- Good point.

45:57.322 --> 45:59.856
- That's so dumb. So much blood.
- Let's untie me.

45:59.858 --> 46:02.258
I'm sorry, Mr. electroshock
therapy torture man.

46:02.260 --> 46:04.193
I'm trying to teach him
a lesson he will remember.

46:04.195 --> 46:08.431
He's not gonna remember anything
if you fry his fucking brain.

46:09.901 --> 46:11.501
Guys...

46:13.470 --> 46:14.537
Do you...

46:15.939 --> 46:17.807
Guys, guys, Joe.

46:17.809 --> 46:19.308
Joe?

46:26.850 --> 46:30.253
Hey, man, you okay?

46:31.488 --> 46:34.056
- I'm taking him back to la.
- No!

46:34.058 --> 46:36.359
We can't take him back
without scaring him first.

46:36.361 --> 46:38.227
- I'll try and reason with him.
- Joe, are you okay?

46:38.229 --> 46:40.029
You can't reason
with these people.

46:40.031 --> 46:41.364
What was that?
What just happened?

46:41.366 --> 46:44.901
And I'm taking him back
on my own, all right?

46:46.537 --> 46:48.504
- Untie Nick.
- What just happened there?

46:48.506 --> 46:50.273
- I knew it's gonna be too much.
- You okay, Joe?

46:50.275 --> 46:52.575
I knew he was gonna freak out
with the battery.

47:05.856 --> 47:10.259
<i>You have one unheard
message sent today at 9:35 A.M.</i>

47:10.261 --> 47:14.330
<i>Oh, Joey. Oh, baby, oh.</i>

47:14.332 --> 47:17.600
<i>I want you to call
and cry with me.</i>

47:19.237 --> 47:21.137
Oh, shit.
Are you crying?

47:21.139 --> 47:25.975
No. No, it was...
It was just my mom.

47:25.977 --> 47:29.412
Your mom crying?
Okay, good.

47:29.414 --> 47:32.615
Phew. That could've been
a little awkward.

47:35.586 --> 47:37.954
- You're gonna be okay.
- Thanks.

47:37.956 --> 47:39.589
Right?

47:40.991 --> 47:43.359
Yeah.

47:43.361 --> 47:45.494
Just hurts a lot, you know?

47:45.496 --> 47:47.530
Yeah, man.

47:47.532 --> 47:50.633
Do you remember back in college
when my barber died?

47:53.871 --> 47:57.974
I don't think it's the same
kind of hurt, exactly.

47:57.976 --> 48:00.042
Maybe.

48:00.044 --> 48:04.046
He was the only guy in the world
I trusted to cut my hair.

48:04.048 --> 48:06.382
And then he was just dead.

48:06.384 --> 48:09.218
But you know, I needed
to have my hair cut still,

48:09.220 --> 48:10.553
so I found a new barber.

48:10.555 --> 48:13.422
But this fucking guy,
he was just so...

48:13.424 --> 48:15.424
Confused by my hair.

48:15.426 --> 48:17.593
There's a delicate,
sort of follicular flow

48:17.595 --> 48:19.996
that goes on up here
with the two cowlicks.

48:19.998 --> 48:21.364
I have, like, three crowns,

48:21.366 --> 48:22.965
and it's confusing
for the best of them.

48:22.967 --> 48:25.001
He just ruined it, man.
I was devastated.

48:25.003 --> 48:27.570
It really stressed me out.

48:27.572 --> 48:30.907
I didn't realize that you take
your haircut so seriously.

48:30.909 --> 48:32.307
Oh, yeah, big time.

48:32.309 --> 48:34.944
You know, and then my hair
started falling out clumps,

48:34.946 --> 48:36.512
which is never good.

48:36.514 --> 48:39.415
I thought, well, fuck, that's
gotta be because of the stress.

48:39.417 --> 48:42.952
And so I thought, well,
you gotta stop the stress.

48:42.954 --> 48:46.455
But then the stress became about
me trying to stop the stress,

48:46.457 --> 48:48.324
which was stressful.

48:48.326 --> 48:51.260
- Huh.
- I didn't know what to do.

48:51.262 --> 48:53.496
I was so lost, man.

48:53.498 --> 48:58.634
Then I found out that Erik
put Nair in my fucking shampoo,

48:58.636 --> 49:03.005
and I was a little hurt,
but honestly...

49:03.007 --> 49:04.941
I was a little relieved.

49:04.943 --> 49:06.108
Really?

49:06.110 --> 49:07.610
Yeah.

49:07.612 --> 49:12.281
Yeah, yeah, because my hair
had a chance to start over.

49:12.283 --> 49:13.582
It was a new day.

49:13.584 --> 49:15.618
It was a new dawn for me
and my buds up there.

49:15.620 --> 49:18.621
You know, I 'm walking around
bald as an eagle

49:18.623 --> 49:22.058
with, like, no eyelashes,
no eyebrows,

49:22.060 --> 49:26.462
but I didn't have that stupid
fucking haircut anymore.

49:26.464 --> 49:28.531
I was free,
and the amount of time it took

49:28.533 --> 49:30.099
for my hair to grow back,

49:30.101 --> 49:32.668
I spent that shopping around
for a new barber,

49:32.670 --> 49:35.237
and that's when I found Karen.

49:35.239 --> 49:38.240
My rock.

49:38.242 --> 49:40.609
So are you dating Karen now?

49:40.611 --> 49:42.979
No. What?

49:42.981 --> 49:44.046
What?

49:44.048 --> 49:45.648
She cuts my hair.

49:45.650 --> 49:47.316
What?

49:47.318 --> 49:49.085
What?

49:51.221 --> 49:54.390
Although,
now that you mention it,

49:54.392 --> 49:56.425
I never really thought of her
that way before.

49:56.427 --> 50:00.363
She's, uh, she's quite fetching.

50:00.365 --> 50:04.333
No, fuck, shit. Uh...

50:04.335 --> 50:05.501
He's ready.

50:06.603 --> 50:08.104
All right.

50:11.274 --> 50:12.274
Okay.

50:12.276 --> 50:13.609
I mean it.

50:13.611 --> 50:15.277
Yeah.

50:15.279 --> 50:17.580
- All right.
- Okay.

50:17.582 --> 50:19.715
- I'll be in.
- Okay.

50:56.454 --> 50:58.387
Crystal left.

50:59.689 --> 51:01.157
Oh.

51:03.093 --> 51:05.261
You hurt her feelings,
so she went home.

51:05.263 --> 51:06.595
No, you didn't.

51:06.597 --> 51:08.664
She was just on
a stripper smoke break.

51:08.666 --> 51:10.666
She had to get back on the pole.

51:29.720 --> 51:31.754
You want me to untie him?

51:31.756 --> 51:32.854
Not yet.

51:32.856 --> 51:36.358
All right, should I do this
fast or slow?

51:36.360 --> 51:37.760
- Slow?
- - Fast.

51:37.762 --> 51:39.228
Fast.

51:39.230 --> 51:40.729
Oh, shit.

51:40.731 --> 51:42.865
Sorry. That was really
on there good.

51:49.506 --> 51:52.141
Yeah, he was thirsty.

51:57.114 --> 51:58.180
Let's begin.

52:00.817 --> 52:02.318
What the fuck?

52:02.320 --> 52:03.586
- Erik...
- I watched a video on YouTube.

52:03.588 --> 52:04.887
I know exactly how to do it now.

52:04.889 --> 52:06.789
- You said you'd let me go.
- We are.

52:06.791 --> 52:09.792
As soon as I introduce you
to mega-tron 26 here.

52:09.794 --> 52:11.160
Whoa!

52:11.162 --> 52:12.661
- Jesus!
- Oh, fuck.

52:12.663 --> 52:14.263
- It'll work.
- It's gonna kill him.

52:14.265 --> 52:15.798
It's not gonna kill him.
He's big.

52:15.800 --> 52:18.134
Erik, fucking put it down,
all right?

52:18.136 --> 52:19.835
Joe, you gotta
teach him a lesson.

52:19.837 --> 52:23.139
No, no, I'm taking him back,
all right?

52:23.141 --> 52:24.273
This was a huge mistake.

52:24.275 --> 52:25.274
You're goddamn right it was.

52:25.276 --> 52:26.342
But nobody got hurt.

52:26.344 --> 52:28.377
- Yet.
- Just shut the fuck up.

52:28.379 --> 52:29.845
These are teachers.

52:29.847 --> 52:32.481
And can you really
blame my friends

52:32.483 --> 52:36.585
for trying to make me
feel better?

52:38.555 --> 52:40.756
You must be Colin.

52:40.758 --> 52:43.292
Jess tell you I was the most
handsome of the guys?

52:43.294 --> 52:45.694
No, but she gave pretty good
descriptions of all of you.

52:45.696 --> 52:47.696
Not surprised at all that you
would do something this stupid.

52:47.698 --> 52:49.265
Let me tell you something, guy.

52:49.267 --> 52:52.468
There are a lot more
stupider things we can do.

52:52.470 --> 52:54.436
More stupid.
You must be Nick.

52:54.438 --> 52:55.638
Ha!

52:55.640 --> 52:57.540
What? Fuck you, man!

52:57.542 --> 52:58.841
Now I'm definitely gonna
electrocute him.

52:58.843 --> 53:00.609
- Yeah, get him.
- Okay, you know what? No.

53:00.611 --> 53:02.311
- I like being Nick.
- Yes!

53:02.313 --> 53:03.445
No, you're not. Look.

53:03.447 --> 53:05.681
It doesn't matter who anyone is.

53:05.683 --> 53:08.184
- I'm taking him back to la.
- That is a bad idea.

53:08.186 --> 53:10.186
This whole fucking thing
was a bad idea, Erik.

53:10.188 --> 53:11.887
I haven't seen you guys
in months,

53:11.889 --> 53:14.223
and I thought it'd be great
to reconnect with you

53:14.225 --> 53:16.659
one last time before
I got married, but now...

53:16.661 --> 53:19.428
Now I'm not getting married

53:19.430 --> 53:24.900
because my fiancée dumped me
for this fucking guy.

53:24.902 --> 53:27.937
But instead of making me
feel better,

53:27.939 --> 53:28.938
I'm hungover,

53:28.940 --> 53:30.706
I can't sit down

53:30.708 --> 53:33.876
because crystal-Susan
broke a belt over my ass,

53:33.878 --> 53:37.913
and to top it all off,
you kidnapped this fucking guy.

53:37.915 --> 53:40.749
- I have a name, dude.
- Shut up!

53:40.751 --> 53:43.819
You know, when this thing's
all over,

53:43.821 --> 53:47.323
I don't think I wanna
see you guys for a while.

53:48.925 --> 53:51.393
I have to be honest, Joe.
I think that's for the best.

53:51.395 --> 53:52.962
- Shut up.
- Okay.

54:13.984 --> 54:15.784
What's that for?

54:15.786 --> 54:17.686
- Just take it.
- No, no, no, no.

54:17.688 --> 54:19.388
Erik, I am not taking that.

54:19.390 --> 54:20.923
Uh-oh, he's running.

54:20.925 --> 54:22.725
Oh, shit.

54:23.960 --> 54:25.494
Go that way!

54:44.681 --> 54:46.315
Split up.

55:16.379 --> 55:20.015
- Why didn't you grab him?
- Was I supposed to grab him?

55:20.017 --> 55:22.985
- I got him, Joe!
- Get him, get him, get him!

55:24.454 --> 55:26.455
Come on.

55:26.457 --> 55:28.023
Stop! Stop, stop, stop!

55:29.426 --> 55:30.993
Agh! Fucking altitude.

55:30.995 --> 55:32.494
Ohh!

55:32.496 --> 55:35.464
Nick! Nick!

55:35.466 --> 55:37.933
Ah, fuck. Okay!

55:39.102 --> 55:40.936
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

55:43.106 --> 55:44.573
Okay, okay, all right.

55:44.575 --> 55:45.641
Hey.

55:45.643 --> 55:47.376
What the fuck, man?

55:47.378 --> 55:49.011
You run so fucking fast.

55:50.880 --> 55:52.981
Do you work out or something?

55:52.983 --> 55:54.516
I ran track in high school.

55:54.518 --> 55:58.120
- So did I, 15 years ago.
- Why did you run, man?

55:58.122 --> 56:01.357
- I said we're gonna let you go.
- So why are my hands tied?

56:01.359 --> 56:03.525
You still haven't said that
you aren't going to the cops,

56:03.527 --> 56:06.128
and I thought maybe I could
talk some sense into you.

56:06.130 --> 56:08.564
Oh, right,
talk some sense into me.

56:08.566 --> 56:11.633
Well, you're the one
who's still tied up,

56:11.635 --> 56:13.402
which means that you can't swim.

56:13.404 --> 56:16.038
- I bet he's a great swimmer.
- Oh, fuck yeah.

56:16.040 --> 56:17.806
Come on, man.

56:17.808 --> 56:19.508
I'll untie your hands
in the car.

56:19.510 --> 56:21.110
That's a good idea.

56:22.645 --> 56:24.012
Come on.

56:24.014 --> 56:25.881
Come on.

56:35.492 --> 56:37.793
Hey, guys, where'd he go?

56:37.795 --> 56:39.061
Nick, hang on!

56:55.145 --> 56:57.079
Oh, shit.

56:57.081 --> 56:58.279
You killed him.

56:58.281 --> 57:00.416
- Why'd you do that?
- He's not dead.

57:02.752 --> 57:04.686
See? He's fine.

57:04.688 --> 57:06.455
His nose looks kinda broken.

57:06.457 --> 57:08.524
Yeah, it kinda does.

57:08.526 --> 57:11.026
Come on, let's get him
in the car.

57:17.867 --> 57:19.668
He still hasn't
learned anything.

57:19.670 --> 57:21.503
Stop making this worse.

57:21.505 --> 57:23.071
I'm trying to make it better.

57:23.073 --> 57:25.607
Erik, no, I'm not taking that.

57:25.609 --> 57:27.109
Do what you said.

57:27.111 --> 57:29.678
Make him dig his own grave
and scare the shit out of him.

57:29.680 --> 57:31.680
No, I'm not doing that.

57:31.682 --> 57:33.215
No one is gonna wanna marry you

57:33.217 --> 57:36.685
if you can't stand up
for yourself.

57:36.687 --> 57:37.820
Fuck you.

57:37.822 --> 57:39.922
Fuck you.

57:43.693 --> 57:45.527
Have a nice drive.

57:45.529 --> 57:49.498
If you hurry, you might
still make it to Ikea.

57:49.500 --> 57:53.035
Hey, man, call us
when you get back to la.

57:56.005 --> 57:58.540
Hey, I wanna tell you
that I texted Karen.

57:58.542 --> 58:01.810
We're gonna meet up for dinner
next week in la.

58:01.812 --> 58:02.811
Karen?

58:02.813 --> 58:04.046
Yeah, my barber.

58:05.882 --> 58:08.584
Give me the fucking keys.

58:08.586 --> 58:09.852
Okay.

58:44.053 --> 58:45.587
Ow.

58:45.589 --> 58:48.757
Jesus, my nose.

58:48.759 --> 58:50.692
Is my nose...
My nose is broken.

58:50.694 --> 58:52.160
- It's fine.
- No.

58:52.162 --> 58:54.129
This is fucking broken.
Look at this!

58:54.131 --> 58:55.797
It was a little bit crooked
before.

58:55.799 --> 58:57.833
- No, it wasn't.
- Yeah, it was.

58:57.835 --> 58:59.668
I don't think so.

58:59.670 --> 59:01.603
Everyone's nose is a little bit
crooked, all right?

59:01.605 --> 59:04.606
You didn't have
a perfectly straight nose.

59:08.177 --> 59:11.547
Oh, my god,
this is so uncomfortable.

59:13.983 --> 59:16.018
My arms are gonna fucking
fall asleep.

59:18.955 --> 59:21.623
Okay, I can't feel my hands now.

59:21.625 --> 59:22.958
You don't need your hands

59:22.960 --> 59:24.893
to sit in the passenger side
of a car.

59:24.895 --> 59:26.962
It's two hours back to la?

59:26.964 --> 59:28.564
Thereabouts.

59:28.566 --> 59:30.599
What the fuck
are you worried about?

59:30.601 --> 59:33.569
Well, you bulldozed me
into a lake.

59:33.571 --> 59:36.705
Come on, man. I'm not gonna
jump out of a moving car.

59:39.709 --> 59:41.043
Damn it.

59:51.754 --> 59:53.188
Shit.

01:00:10.373 --> 01:00:12.608
Oh, my god,
this is really uncomfortable.

01:00:12.610 --> 01:00:14.610
Just try to relax your arms.
They won't fall asleep.

01:00:14.612 --> 01:00:17.012
See how I'm sitting?
How am I supposed to relax?

01:00:17.014 --> 01:00:18.947
- Just...

01:00:21.117 --> 01:00:24.086
- Fuck.
- Now you have to untie me.

01:00:27.156 --> 01:00:28.690
No way.

01:00:28.692 --> 01:00:29.992
What, you know him?

01:00:32.829 --> 01:00:33.895
Don't say anything.

01:00:33.897 --> 01:00:36.732
I'm not gonna have to.

01:00:36.734 --> 01:00:39.635
All right, lift your arms up.
Hurry up. Get them up.

01:00:39.637 --> 01:00:41.637
I can't lift them any higher.
My arms fell asleep.

01:00:41.639 --> 01:00:43.138
Oh, shit.
You're doing it tighter.

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:44.773
No, I...
I was tightening it.

01:00:44.775 --> 01:00:46.908
He's coming, Joe.
Now he's coming.

01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:48.677
Shh, shh. Okay.

01:00:51.347 --> 01:00:53.749
Don't say anything, please.

01:00:57.654 --> 01:00:59.988
Well.

01:01:01.058 --> 01:01:02.324
Cheech and Chong.

01:01:04.961 --> 01:01:06.395
Hi.

01:01:06.397 --> 01:01:07.929
Hi.

01:01:07.931 --> 01:01:09.998
Are you?

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.166
What?

01:01:11.168 --> 01:01:13.802
Are you high, son?

01:01:13.804 --> 01:01:15.003
No.

01:01:15.005 --> 01:01:17.205
- What about you?
- He's not.

01:01:17.207 --> 01:01:20.075
I was talking to him.

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:22.210
No.

01:01:22.212 --> 01:01:24.046
Officer, I don't smoke.

01:01:24.048 --> 01:01:25.280
Of course you don't.

01:01:25.282 --> 01:01:28.350
You have any idea
why I'm asking you that?

01:01:28.352 --> 01:01:30.085
Because you're cracking down

01:01:30.087 --> 01:01:32.120
on the abuse of
medical marijuana in big bear?

01:01:32.122 --> 01:01:33.722
Are you patronizing me, son?

01:01:33.724 --> 01:01:37.125
No. No, I...
You said that before.

01:01:38.961 --> 01:01:40.696
Is your nose broke?

01:01:42.699 --> 01:01:46.968
No, sir. It's always been
a little bit crooked.

01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:48.804
Hmm.

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:52.140
License and registration.

01:01:52.142 --> 01:01:53.742
Affirmative.

01:01:53.744 --> 01:01:54.976
What did you say to me?

01:01:54.978 --> 01:01:57.412
Yes. Yes.

01:01:57.414 --> 01:01:59.381
Registration's in the glove box.

01:01:59.383 --> 01:02:01.083
Uh-huh.

01:02:04.787 --> 01:02:07.255
You just got your nails done?

01:02:07.257 --> 01:02:09.357
I got it, I got it.

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:24.206
What?

01:02:25.374 --> 01:02:27.476
License and registration.

01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:35.884
Where are you two young men
headed today?

01:02:35.886 --> 01:02:38.120
- A hike.
- To la.

01:02:39.522 --> 01:02:42.824
You both just told me
two different things.

01:02:45.294 --> 01:02:48.163
Son, where are you headed?

01:02:52.803 --> 01:02:55.036
Step out of the vehicle.

01:02:55.038 --> 01:02:57.839
Officer, excuse me.

01:02:57.841 --> 01:02:59.908
We're going back to la.

01:02:59.910 --> 01:03:03.178
But we're just gonna stop off
real quick and have a hike.

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:04.946
You know, enjoy some nature

01:03:04.948 --> 01:03:08.550
before we have to head back
to that smog-infested jungle.

01:03:09.919 --> 01:03:12.888
I never did care too much
for Los Angeles myself.

01:03:12.890 --> 01:03:14.289
Oh, lord, me neither.

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:16.191
But it sure is nice
that there's a place

01:03:16.193 --> 01:03:19.795
as safe and quiet
as big bear's so close.

01:03:19.797 --> 01:03:23.198
Up around the next bend,
there's a real pretty hike.

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:25.100
It's my husband's favorite.

01:03:25.102 --> 01:03:29.337
Just make sure you park in the
designated parking areas only.

01:03:29.339 --> 01:03:31.473
Absolutely.
Thank you, officer.

01:03:31.475 --> 01:03:33.508
Sure.

01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:35.043
Pants?

01:03:35.045 --> 01:03:36.311
Next time.

01:03:36.313 --> 01:03:39.247
Crack, crack.

01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:53.495
Did he say husband?

01:04:02.338 --> 01:04:04.506
Why did you say
we were going for a hike?

01:04:04.508 --> 01:04:05.507
Because we are.

01:04:05.509 --> 01:04:07.108
- I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:09.611
Okay, I could have just
told that cop

01:04:09.613 --> 01:04:11.980
about the gun that you're
hiding underneath your leg.

01:04:11.982 --> 01:04:14.282
Yeah? Well, why didn't you?

01:04:14.284 --> 01:04:16.251
I don't know.

01:04:16.253 --> 01:04:18.887
Because you saved me
from your friends,

01:04:18.889 --> 01:04:21.556
and you said you were gonna
take back me to la.

01:04:21.558 --> 01:04:25.961
And maybe I feel a little bit
sorry for you.

01:04:32.401 --> 01:04:34.970
You ruined my life,
but not my bachelor party.

01:04:34.972 --> 01:04:36.972
I thought it wasn't
your bachelor party anymore.

01:04:36.974 --> 01:04:39.608
Yeah, well, it is,
whether I like it or not.

01:04:39.610 --> 01:04:40.908
Okay, Joe,

01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:43.545
but you're digging a very deep
hole for yourself here.

01:04:43.547 --> 01:04:45.146
No.

01:04:45.148 --> 01:04:47.449
That's what you're gonna do.

01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:59.060
Ohh...

01:05:09.105 --> 01:05:11.006
No.

01:05:11.008 --> 01:05:14.042
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.
What are you doing?

01:05:14.044 --> 01:05:16.478
I'm digging.

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:18.213
No, you're whistling.

01:05:18.215 --> 01:05:21.516
Yeah. I do that
when I'm bored.

01:05:21.518 --> 01:05:23.919
Aren't you thinking about
what you did?

01:05:23.921 --> 01:05:26.488
No. I'm thinking about
what a waste of time this is.

01:05:26.490 --> 01:05:29.024
- What?
- You're not going to shoot me.

01:05:29.026 --> 01:05:31.192
If your friend Erik was here,
I'd be a little fucking worried

01:05:31.194 --> 01:05:32.928
because that guy, he's psycho.

01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:34.462
You need to be thinking
about what you did

01:05:34.464 --> 01:05:35.931
that got you to this place.

01:05:35.933 --> 01:05:37.933
I opened the door
to your psycho friend.

01:05:37.935 --> 01:05:40.335
- Before that.
- I didn't convince Jess

01:05:40.337 --> 01:05:42.470
to fall out of love with you,
all right?

01:05:42.472 --> 01:05:44.372
That happened a long time before
I ever came around.

01:05:44.374 --> 01:05:46.274
- Fuck you.
- It's true!

01:05:46.276 --> 01:05:48.343
In reality,
I played a very little part

01:05:48.345 --> 01:05:50.011
in the breakup of your marriage.

01:05:50.013 --> 01:05:51.079
- A little part?
- Yeah.

01:05:51.081 --> 01:05:52.280
Are you talking about your dick?

01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:54.416
- No.
- Is your dick the little part?

01:05:54.418 --> 01:05:56.217
Because in the reality
that I live in,

01:05:56.219 --> 01:05:58.687
the number one thing
Jess loves to freak out about

01:05:58.689 --> 01:06:00.355
is her allergy to latex.

01:06:00.357 --> 01:06:03.224
So we always had to use
polyisoprene condoms,

01:06:03.226 --> 01:06:04.726
and they only come in wrappers

01:06:04.728 --> 01:06:07.095
like the one that fell out of
your pocket back in the car.

01:06:07.097 --> 01:06:10.565
So I guess your little part,
I'm talking about your dick,

01:06:10.567 --> 01:06:14.069
played a pretty big part
in why she left me.

01:06:14.071 --> 01:06:18.073
Hey, it's your robe.
Could've been your condom.

01:06:18.075 --> 01:06:21.042
Yeah. Well...

01:06:21.044 --> 01:06:23.578
I don't wear magnums.

01:06:28.317 --> 01:06:30.151
Has it ever occurred to you

01:06:30.153 --> 01:06:34.255
that that she might've left you
not because of who I am,

01:06:34.257 --> 01:06:37.125
but because of who you aren't?

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:42.330
Get out.

01:06:42.332 --> 01:06:44.466
- What?
- Hand me the shovel.

01:06:44.468 --> 01:06:46.134
- I can keep digging.
- That's deep enough.

01:06:46.136 --> 01:06:47.535
- No, it's not deep enough.
- Yes, it is.

01:06:47.537 --> 01:06:48.670
It's not long enough.

01:06:48.672 --> 01:06:50.005
Hand me the fucking shovel!

01:06:50.007 --> 01:06:51.039
Okay.

01:06:53.275 --> 01:06:55.076
Get out.

01:06:55.078 --> 01:06:56.678
Joe, calm down.

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:58.346
Turn around.

01:06:58.348 --> 01:07:02.083
- All right, why don't we just...
- Shut the fuck up for once.

01:07:02.085 --> 01:07:03.318
- Okay.
- Turn around.

01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:05.620
Okay.

01:07:08.557 --> 01:07:11.159
You don't need to do this, Joe.

01:07:13.095 --> 01:07:17.432
I'm so tired of everyone telling
me what they think I need.

01:07:19.703 --> 01:07:22.670
All right. Okay.

01:07:22.672 --> 01:07:26.374
Maybe this is
exactly what I need.

01:07:28.110 --> 01:07:30.045
Maybe I know.

01:07:32.214 --> 01:07:34.382
Maybe I know what I need.

01:08:04.447 --> 01:08:06.748
I love him.

01:08:56.732 --> 01:08:57.732
Oh, shit.

01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:16.651
Ooh!

01:09:23.893 --> 01:09:25.560
Oh, my...

01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:36.237
Oww!

01:09:40.743 --> 01:09:43.678
It's all your fault, you fuck!
Why'd you do this to me?

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:46.180
- It's my fault, okay?
- I will fucking kill you!

01:09:46.183 --> 01:09:48.316
- Don't kill me, please!
- Give me a fucking reason!

01:09:48.318 --> 01:09:49.951
Because, Joe, I have a kid!

01:09:49.953 --> 01:09:52.587
All right?
I have a daughter.

01:09:52.589 --> 01:09:54.355
Her name is Meg,
and she's amazing and beautiful.

01:09:54.357 --> 01:09:56.791
Please don't take me away
from her, Joe, please.

01:09:56.793 --> 01:10:01.262
Please don't take me
away from her, Joe. Please.

01:10:01.264 --> 01:10:05.200
Why is your wedding ring on
if you're getting divorced?

01:10:05.202 --> 01:10:07.669
Why do you still have
your wedding ring on?

01:10:11.507 --> 01:10:14.409
You haven't told her yet?

01:10:14.411 --> 01:10:19.314
I was gonna tell her today.

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:23.818
We weren't careful, and...

01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:27.255
I thought it was the right thing
to do, to get married.

01:10:27.257 --> 01:10:28.623
Was it also
the right thing to do

01:10:28.625 --> 01:10:30.225
to cheat on your wife
with my fiancée?

01:10:30.227 --> 01:10:32.994
Jess didn't cheat on you.
Not like that.

01:10:32.996 --> 01:10:35.797
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:10:35.799 --> 01:10:38.566
Yeah, last night was
the first time that we ever...

01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:39.968
Polyisoprened.

01:10:39.970 --> 01:10:41.669
Great. You guys just started
boning last night.

01:10:41.671 --> 01:10:43.771
That makes me feel
so much better. Thank you.

01:10:43.773 --> 01:10:45.907
You know what, Joe?
My life is not all rosy either.

01:10:45.909 --> 01:10:47.942
- Really?
- No, it's not.

01:10:47.944 --> 01:10:50.411
I got married to a woman
that I barely even know.

01:10:50.413 --> 01:10:51.813
We're not happy.

01:10:51.815 --> 01:10:53.615
Why marry someone
you're not happy with?

01:10:53.617 --> 01:10:57.352
It didn't seem like the most
important criteria at the time.

01:11:02.558 --> 01:11:05.393
Why did you wanna
get married to Jess?

01:11:05.395 --> 01:11:07.962
- Because I love her.
- Yeah?

01:11:07.964 --> 01:11:09.664
So what?

01:11:09.666 --> 01:11:10.999
What else?

01:11:13.535 --> 01:11:15.370
Because we...

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:22.410
Because we...

01:11:22.412 --> 01:11:24.279
We were dating.

01:11:24.281 --> 01:11:26.714
We lived together and...

01:11:26.716 --> 01:11:29.384
Then you get married.

01:11:29.386 --> 01:11:32.020
So it was just a step?

01:11:32.022 --> 01:11:34.055
Things were good.

01:11:34.057 --> 01:11:36.824
We worked.
Isn't that why you marry someone

01:11:36.826 --> 01:11:38.860
because you love them
and you can live with them?

01:11:38.862 --> 01:11:40.762
No, I don't think so anymore.

01:11:40.764 --> 01:11:42.830
I think you marry someone
because you love them,

01:11:42.832 --> 01:11:45.366
and you can't live without them.

01:11:45.368 --> 01:11:49.070
For the longest time, I was just
dealing with my life, you know,

01:11:49.072 --> 01:11:51.572
because I took the step that I
thought I was supposed to take.

01:11:51.574 --> 01:11:53.675
But that's not fair.

01:11:53.677 --> 01:11:56.044
It's not fair to my wife,

01:11:56.046 --> 01:11:59.814
it's not fair to my daughter,
and it's not fair to me.

01:11:59.816 --> 01:12:04.552
Then I met Jess,
and it was different.

01:12:04.554 --> 01:12:06.721
I was different,

01:12:06.723 --> 01:12:09.857
and I knew immediately
that no matter what,

01:12:09.859 --> 01:12:12.460
no matter how fucking messy
this thing got,

01:12:12.462 --> 01:12:15.063
no matter how painful,

01:12:15.065 --> 01:12:17.965
this was life...

01:12:17.967 --> 01:12:22.537
Giving me exactly what I needed:

01:12:22.539 --> 01:12:24.906
An opportunity to start over.

01:12:28.477 --> 01:12:31.012
Like Nair.

01:12:31.014 --> 01:12:33.414
What?

01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:41.989
I was relieved.

01:12:44.461 --> 01:12:47.362
When she broke off
the engagement, I was angry

01:12:47.364 --> 01:12:50.798
and disappointed
and pissed, but...

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:53.901
The first thing I felt, and I...

01:12:53.903 --> 01:12:58.473
I didn't know why,

01:12:58.475 --> 01:13:00.475
I was relieved.

01:13:10.854 --> 01:13:14.389
I guess it was
a pretty good sign

01:13:14.391 --> 01:13:18.860
that you weren't
supposed be married.

01:13:18.862 --> 01:13:22.797
So in a way, I guess
I sort of did you a favor.

01:13:23.766 --> 01:13:25.500
No, I'm kidding.

01:13:25.502 --> 01:13:27.502
Jesus, man.

01:13:27.504 --> 01:13:29.937
Fuck, are you for real?

01:13:29.939 --> 01:13:32.407
I mean, after all this?

01:13:32.409 --> 01:13:35.643
You were kidnapped,
tied up in a basement,

01:13:35.645 --> 01:13:36.911
I put a fucking gun to your head

01:13:36.913 --> 01:13:38.413
and made you dig a hole
in the ground,

01:13:38.415 --> 01:13:40.815
and you still can't say
that you feel sorry

01:13:40.817 --> 01:13:42.750
for stealing my fiancée?

01:13:45.788 --> 01:13:48.489
Why do you care so much
about how I feel?

01:13:52.961 --> 01:13:55.129
I don't know.

01:13:57.132 --> 01:14:00.735
I think I thought
it would make it go away.

01:14:00.737 --> 01:14:02.537
Make what go away?

01:14:04.139 --> 01:14:08.976
It's like this bear
comes out of the woods

01:14:08.978 --> 01:14:14.582
and just sits down on my chest,

01:14:14.584 --> 01:14:16.451
and I can't breathe.

01:14:16.453 --> 01:14:19.086
I feel like I'm gonna suffocate

01:14:19.088 --> 01:14:24.792
because this fucking bear
is just sitting on top of me.

01:14:27.196 --> 01:14:30.865
Thought maybe if I got revenge,
it would stop.

01:14:30.867 --> 01:14:32.467
So you thought if you killed me,

01:14:32.469 --> 01:14:34.869
your panic attacks
would go away?

01:14:34.871 --> 01:14:36.804
- What?
- You get tunnel vision?

01:14:36.806 --> 01:14:38.473
Yeah.

01:14:38.475 --> 01:14:41.576
Feel like your heart's beating
out of your chest?

01:14:41.578 --> 01:14:42.810
Yeah.

01:14:42.812 --> 01:14:46.514
I had those
right before I had my kid.

01:14:46.516 --> 01:14:48.149
I was so fucking scared.

01:14:50.586 --> 01:14:52.220
How did you get it to stop?

01:14:52.222 --> 01:14:56.157
- Well, I didn't kill anybody.
- I wasn't gonna kill you.

01:14:56.159 --> 01:15:00.928
I just thought
maybe if I scared you,

01:15:00.930 --> 01:15:04.932
you know, if I made you
dig your own grave...

01:15:04.934 --> 01:15:07.602
Like in a mob movie?

01:15:09.973 --> 01:15:11.672
Yeah.

01:15:11.674 --> 01:15:13.541
That's ridiculous.

01:15:20.115 --> 01:15:25.586
You know, when I get back to la,
I have nowhere to live.

01:15:25.588 --> 01:15:27.755
I am a...

01:15:27.757 --> 01:15:32.627
I am a homeless, underemployed,

01:15:32.629 --> 01:15:34.829
thirty-something
single male

01:15:34.831 --> 01:15:36.964
who just got dumped
by his fiancée

01:15:36.966 --> 01:15:42.069
because he was too afraid
to do it himself.

01:15:42.071 --> 01:15:44.138
Well, hey,
I'm getting a divorce.

01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:46.641
- You're gonna be a divorcé.
- With a kid.

01:15:46.643 --> 01:15:48.643
Oh, shit.

01:15:48.645 --> 01:15:50.144
Oh, man.

01:15:50.146 --> 01:15:52.313
- That might be worse.
- It's way worse.

01:15:52.315 --> 01:15:54.682
And you're never gonna
get custody of the kid

01:15:54.684 --> 01:15:56.017
because you're leaving her,

01:15:56.019 --> 01:15:58.085
and you're only gonna
get to see your kid

01:15:58.087 --> 01:16:00.555
twice a month, if that.

01:16:02.224 --> 01:16:04.692
Oh, shit.

01:16:10.966 --> 01:16:13.234
Jess farts in her sleep.

01:16:13.236 --> 01:16:14.569
Really?

01:16:14.571 --> 01:16:15.937
Sometimes.

01:16:15.939 --> 01:16:18.105
Just make sure
you fall asleep first.

01:16:18.107 --> 01:16:20.708
Yeah.

01:16:20.710 --> 01:16:22.910
Yeah.

01:16:32.187 --> 01:16:36.357
Just leave it at Jess's.
I need to get my clothes still.

01:16:40.796 --> 01:16:42.063
Thanks.

01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:52.273
Hey, Joe, I know you don't want
anybody telling you

01:16:52.275 --> 01:16:56.143
what you need right now, but...

01:16:56.145 --> 01:16:59.180
I always found it was best
just to face it head-on.

01:16:59.182 --> 01:17:01.282
What?

01:17:01.284 --> 01:17:03.718
The bear.

01:18:23.766 --> 01:18:26.133
Aaahhh!

01:18:28.437 --> 01:18:30.771
Aaahhh!

01:18:33.241 --> 01:18:35.910
Aaahhh!

01:19:48.985 --> 01:19:51.485
No, no!

01:20:16.878 --> 01:20:19.814
Ohh!

01:20:19.816 --> 01:20:22.817
Boom, boom, boom!

01:20:22.819 --> 01:20:23.884
Fuck yeah!

01:20:23.886 --> 01:20:26.086
Oh! Oh, that was awesome.

01:20:26.088 --> 01:20:28.255
Awesome, awesome.
That was awesome.

01:20:28.257 --> 01:20:30.491
- You guys were great.
- Fuck you!

01:20:31.493 --> 01:20:32.960
Yeah?

01:20:32.962 --> 01:20:34.895
Fuck you.

01:20:37.499 --> 01:20:39.934
Welcome back, amigo.

01:20:39.936 --> 01:20:41.268
Gracias.

01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:43.904
Ahh!

01:20:43.906 --> 01:20:45.372
I feel so much better.

01:20:45.374 --> 01:20:47.074
Oh, you guys
probably want those off.

01:20:47.076 --> 01:20:48.409
Ow! Ohh!

01:20:48.411 --> 01:20:51.378
These clamps really hurt.
What are you doing, Joe?

01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:53.247
I think the faster, the better.

01:20:53.249 --> 01:20:54.582
You wouldn't.

01:20:54.584 --> 01:20:56.584
- I need to.
- No, you don't.

01:20:56.586 --> 01:21:00.254
- Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe.
- No, no, no, no!

01:21:00.256 --> 01:21:01.555
- Don't!

01:21:23.979 --> 01:21:27.381
I know. I know we all lose
our way from time to time.

01:21:27.383 --> 01:21:30.017
I just thought I was
stronger than that, you know?

01:21:30.019 --> 01:21:32.353
I'm embarrassed.

01:21:32.355 --> 01:21:34.154
No, you're right, you're right.

01:21:34.156 --> 01:21:37.057
Without weakness, we never
know what true strength is.

01:21:37.059 --> 01:21:39.159
Sage words.

01:21:39.161 --> 01:21:41.028
What time is the meeting
tomorrow night?

01:21:43.298 --> 01:21:44.899
No, I don't need a ride.

01:21:44.901 --> 01:21:46.433
That's cool. All right.
Thanks, Mike.

01:21:46.435 --> 01:21:48.269
I'll see you there, definitely.

01:21:48.271 --> 01:21:50.337
All right. Later, bye.

01:21:53.976 --> 01:21:55.542
Sorry about that.

01:21:56.478 --> 01:21:59.980
Hey, where's my dad's gun?

01:21:59.982 --> 01:22:02.182
Oh, I buried it.

01:22:02.184 --> 01:22:04.151
Really?

01:22:04.153 --> 01:22:05.519
Yeah.

01:22:05.521 --> 01:22:09.924
Damn it, man!
He's gonna be really pissed off.

01:22:11.393 --> 01:22:13.294
Well, I hate my dad.

01:22:13.296 --> 01:22:16.063
You need a place to crash
for a while, Joe?

01:22:16.065 --> 01:22:18.065
Uh, no, I'm good. Thanks.

01:22:18.067 --> 01:22:20.401
Where are you gonna stay?

01:22:23.939 --> 01:22:26.640
I have no idea.

01:26:05.426 --> 01:26:08.195
<i>- Hey, dude!
- What, what?</i>

01:26:08.197 --> 01:26:11.398
<i>Come over here.</i>

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:13.901
<i>Give me a hug, man.</i>

01:26:13.903 --> 01:26:17.437
<i>See, what you were scared of
this whole time</i>

01:26:17.439 --> 01:26:20.440
<i>is exactly what you've been
fighting for, man.</i>

01:26:42.263 --> 01:26:43.630
<i>Hey!</i>

01:26:46.734 --> 01:26:50.704
<i>Did I tell you
what to think, man?</i>

01:26:50.706 --> 01:26:52.773
<i>Well, good.</i>

01:26:52.775 --> 01:26:56.643
<i>But I hope you didn't listen.</i>

01:26:56.645 --> 01:26:59.279
<i>At least in hindsight.</i>

01:27:00.305 --> 01:27:06.595
