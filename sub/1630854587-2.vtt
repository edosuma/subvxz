00:14.750 --> 00:18.125
Morning, Karen.
Morning, Peter Dinklage in a dog suit.

00:18.208 --> 00:21.375
Bark, bark. I love drugs.

00:21.458 --> 00:22.750
Wait, what the fuck?

00:22.833 --> 00:26.791
Elon Musk is coming to scout Paradise
today for the new Tesla headquarters,

00:26.875 --> 00:28.541
and I didn't want
any idiots screwing it up,

00:28.625 --> 00:31.166
so I replaced everyone
in town with actors!

00:31.250 --> 00:34.666
Drug train coming through. Who wants some…

00:34.750 --> 00:35.750
Line!

00:35.833 --> 00:40.666
Are you professional or not?
I'm Christian Bale, you prick!

00:40.750 --> 00:45.750
I gained 500 fucking pounds
for this fucking role! Goop!

00:45.833 --> 00:49.833
Hello, I'm Hopson, and I love cum.

00:49.916 --> 00:52.791
Okay, that's a pretty good Hopson,
but who's that as Fitz?

00:52.875 --> 00:53.708
Bill Cosby.

00:53.791 --> 00:58.458
I had the sex with the dolphins
in the buttocks, you see.

00:58.541 --> 01:00.708
-No. No. There is a line, Karen.

01:00.791 --> 01:02.666
Ooh! Who'd you get to play me?

01:02.750 --> 01:04.458
Rob Riggle. He was cheap.

01:04.541 --> 01:08.291
What? Rob fucking Riggle,
the host of <i>Holey Moley</i>?

01:08.375 --> 01:10.041
I look nothing like that guy.

01:10.125 --> 01:12.125
Plus, everyone else got an A-list actor.

01:12.208 --> 01:14.583
You even replaced our son
with Tilda Swinton.

01:14.666 --> 01:15.958
Dad, it's me.

01:16.041 --> 01:17.375
AFKAK.

01:18.125 --> 01:20.500
No one would take on the AFKAK role.

01:20.583 --> 01:23.916
Not even Nicolas Cage,
and he says yes to everything.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.416
I'm a side table.

01:25.500 --> 01:28.791
Who wants to open me up
and look for the remote?!

01:30.541 --> 01:34.583
Karen, you are not replacing everyone
to impress Elon Musk.

01:34.666 --> 01:36.541
I want all these actors outta here!

01:36.625 --> 01:38.500
Just one more for fun.

01:38.583 --> 01:40.500
It's me. Hobo-Cop.

01:40.583 --> 01:43.333
I poop in a mayonnaise jar. Oh boy.

01:54.166 --> 01:57.541
Son, I've got the most exciting,
best possible news ever.

01:57.625 --> 01:59.916
Oh, thank God. You found Gina.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.500
Fuck Gina! In two days,
the McRib is coming back!

02:03.583 --> 02:05.458
Ugh. You actually eat that shit?

02:05.541 --> 02:09.000
The only way the McRib could be
more disgusting is if Taco Bell made it.

02:09.083 --> 02:10.875
High Bullet wouldn't say that.

02:10.958 --> 02:12.875
I wouldn't say that at all.

02:12.958 --> 02:15.416
Fuck this dude, man. McRibs are awesome.

02:15.500 --> 02:17.750
That must be some good shit.
Let me hit that.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.666
This could have been
the whole episode right here, man.

02:27.750 --> 02:30.125
Delivery for AFKAK Crawford.

02:30.208 --> 02:32.333
Wow. That's a big package.

02:32.416 --> 02:36.291
I like big packages and cum.

02:36.375 --> 02:37.875
Uh… What's in the crate?

02:38.916 --> 02:40.041
Headphones.

02:40.791 --> 02:42.458
Ooh. Headphones, huh?

02:42.541 --> 02:45.666
Yeah, I-I'm taking the day off.
I gotta go fuck my headphones.

02:46.166 --> 02:49.833
I'm so excited. Goop!
My diddy's finally coming home!

02:50.416 --> 02:54.375
Diddy? You mean your dad? I thought
he abandoned your family years ago.

02:54.458 --> 03:00.208
Oh no. He was just on a 20-year
secret spy mission, and it's finally over.

03:00.291 --> 03:05.125
Did I ever tell you that he personally
killed Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden?

03:05.208 --> 03:06.458
He's the toughest man I know.

03:06.541 --> 03:10.166
Oh hey. My ears are burning
like cherries jubilee.

03:10.250 --> 03:12.541
Somebody gabbing about me?

03:12.625 --> 03:17.750
So, you killed Osama bin Laden
on a supersecret 20-year mission?

03:17.833 --> 03:19.208
Hell yeah, I did.

03:19.291 --> 03:23.083
All I do is kill bad guys and crush puss.

03:23.166 --> 03:25.333
Strawberry Marlow. Nice to meet you.

03:25.416 --> 03:27.458
What kind of name is Strawberry?

03:27.541 --> 03:29.541
Uh, the perfect name?

03:29.625 --> 03:33.000
'Cause I leave my enemies
the same way I leave my puss.

03:33.083 --> 03:35.250
Bloodred and covered in seed.

03:35.333 --> 03:37.875
Ooh! My Diddy is so brave!

03:37.958 --> 03:41.041
Hold on, son. What is up with your voice?

03:41.125 --> 03:44.208
Sounds like you got your bing-bongs
trapped in a honey jar.

03:44.291 --> 03:47.875
I'm sorry I don't have
a gravelly man voice like you, Diddy.

03:48.500 --> 03:49.916
And what is this?

03:50.000 --> 03:53.375
A real man don't own no kitty cats!

03:54.208 --> 03:55.791
He owns chinchillas!

03:55.875 --> 03:57.458
Come here, babies. Come here.

03:57.541 --> 04:01.000
You're tickling my neck now!

04:01.083 --> 04:02.833
Stop, Liza Chinelli!

04:02.916 --> 04:04.750
And where the hell is your moustache?

04:04.833 --> 04:09.000
I'm sorry, Diddy. I'll grow a moustache
so I can be rough and tough just like you.

04:09.083 --> 04:12.000
Good. Now, I made lemon bars for everyone.

04:12.083 --> 04:16.250
Except you, Dusty. Maybe you get one
when you start acting like a man like me.

04:17.208 --> 04:18.291
Aw.

04:18.375 --> 04:20.125
Whoa. Shit!

04:20.208 --> 04:24.208
These lemon bars are so good, I'm starting
to think you really did kill bin Laden.

04:24.291 --> 04:26.916
Well, now, I can't take all the credit.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.291
I did have the help
of my Strawberry Action Squad.

04:30.375 --> 04:31.208
Hmm…

04:31.291 --> 04:33.958
Are the other
Strawberry Action Squad members like you?

04:34.041 --> 04:35.833
Not at all!

04:35.916 --> 04:39.833
We got a robot, a giant talking squid,
a leprechaun made out of rocks,

04:39.916 --> 04:42.458
a kung fu kangaroo,
Charles Bronson's ghost,

04:42.541 --> 04:44.708
Lenny the Laser Lizard, Johnny Pecs,

04:44.791 --> 04:47.958
Wilbur the Karate Wizard,
and there's Lieutenant Friskers.

04:48.041 --> 04:49.833
He's a radioactive werewolf.

04:49.916 --> 04:53.208
Now, that's the biggest crock
of horseshit I ever heard!

04:53.291 --> 04:57.333
I mean, there's no way that package
Kevin went to fuck was headphones!

04:57.416 --> 04:59.583
Sorry, that's been bugging me
for, like, ten minutes.

04:59.666 --> 05:02.666
Your story sounds legit.
Thank you for your service, sir.

05:04.750 --> 05:07.375
Fitz, this co-parenting thing is a breeze.

05:07.458 --> 05:12.125
Yeah. We agree on everything.
Like how family baths are not weird.

05:12.208 --> 05:15.250
And we can glance at each other's dicks,
but no staring. Cool.

05:15.333 --> 05:17.666
I was hoping
you'd bring up dicks.

05:17.750 --> 05:20.291
I scheduled Junior's circumcision
for tomorrow.

05:20.375 --> 05:22.875
You what?
I'm totally against circumcision.

05:22.958 --> 05:25.500
I-I can't believe you made the appointment
without even asking me.

05:25.583 --> 05:26.833
What's wrong with circumcision?

05:27.416 --> 05:28.500
Read this.

05:28.583 --> 05:31.291
Why do you carry a pamphlet
about the dangers of circumcision?

05:31.375 --> 05:32.583
You know, for the tips.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.708
Oh!

05:35.333 --> 05:37.000
Get-- get, the tip?

05:37.083 --> 05:40.375
Oh, man.

05:40.458 --> 05:41.625
Whole episode.

05:41.708 --> 05:44.458
I didn't realize
you felt so strongly about it.

05:44.541 --> 05:47.416
I guess we don't have
to get Junior circumcised.

05:47.500 --> 05:49.125
Thank you for understanding.

05:49.208 --> 05:52.666
Now, I'm gonna go put Junior and his
beautiful, uncut pecker pouch to bed.

05:52.750 --> 05:55.208
You're not gonna listen
to that dog, are you?

05:55.291 --> 05:58.250
A circumcised penis
is much easier to keep clean.

05:58.333 --> 06:01.500
And I'm less likely to contract HPV.

06:06.166 --> 06:10.333
Look at that fucked up dick!

06:10.416 --> 06:14.916
Looking like he should be in Peru,
sucking ants off a stick.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.375
Get outta here, High Fitz!

06:22.708 --> 06:24.208
<i>Hi. I'm Stacey.</i>

06:24.291 --> 06:27.375
<i>I am programmed for your pleasure.</i>
<i>What do you wanna do first?</i>

06:27.458 --> 06:28.666
Lose my virginity?

06:31.333 --> 06:33.791
Have I got a treat for you.

06:33.875 --> 06:36.416
<i>My Hero Academia</i> Sexual Lubricant.

06:37.541 --> 06:39.291
<i>Wow. That's… hot.</i>

06:39.375 --> 06:41.958
<i>You know what?</i>
<i>I'm a little tired from the trip.</i>

06:42.041 --> 06:44.458
You're saying you don't wanna have sex?

06:44.541 --> 06:47.958
<i>Of course I do.</i>
<i>That's literally my only function.</i>

06:48.041 --> 06:50.166
<i>I just wanna be in the right mood.</i>

06:50.250 --> 06:53.041
Sure. We can do it in the morning.

06:55.791 --> 06:57.625
Rise and shine.

06:57.708 --> 06:58.750
Ready for a little--

06:58.833 --> 06:59.958
<i>I've got a headache.</i>

07:00.041 --> 07:02.083
Hey, babe. Ready for a nooner?

07:02.166 --> 07:05.250
<i>Sorry. Sleeping. Snore. Snore.</i>

07:05.333 --> 07:07.583
I know what'll put you in the mood.

07:07.666 --> 07:09.750
<i>Star Wars</i> sex toys.

07:09.833 --> 07:11.583
Darth Maul or Kylo Ren?

07:11.666 --> 07:14.041
Just pick one,
and I'll stick it right up my butt.

07:14.125 --> 07:15.958
<i>Oh. That's cool. But--</i>

07:16.041 --> 07:17.916
You don't wanna blow up my Dirt Star?

07:18.000 --> 07:20.583
<i>It's not you.</i>
<i>Uh… I'm on my period.</i>

07:20.666 --> 07:23.041
Sex dolls don't get their peri--

07:23.125 --> 07:25.958
Oh. So that's what was
in the ruby package.

07:28.041 --> 07:30.458
Thanks for dropping me off
at the bus station.

07:30.541 --> 07:32.875
Hey, uh, Nick.
You need any cash for bus fare?

07:32.958 --> 07:35.416
Uh, no. I don't need any cash for fare,

07:35.500 --> 07:38.625
because I live
in the bus station bathroom!

07:40.041 --> 07:43.708
<i>Randall, Elon will be here any minute.</i>
<i>Make sure there are no weirdos around.</i>

07:45.750 --> 07:47.500
Hello, weirdo.

07:47.583 --> 07:48.708
Glad I kept this.

07:49.500 --> 07:51.291
Better put on my bulletproof vest.

07:53.166 --> 07:55.583
What the hell
is that stupid fucking truck?

07:55.666 --> 07:58.250
Looks like you drove this thing
straight out of <i>Halo 1</i>.

07:58.333 --> 08:00.583
Looks like a rock monster
fucked a triangle.

08:00.666 --> 08:03.000
I hate this truck.
Makes me think about math.

08:03.083 --> 08:06.458
This truck makes me angry, but also sad
for you for not having a dick.

08:06.541 --> 08:09.250
Whatever. I'm cool. You're not. Ha ha.

08:09.333 --> 08:10.833
You're under citizen's arrest,

08:10.916 --> 08:14.916
because some ass-faced douchebag
named Elon Musk is coming to town.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.083
Have Triple A tow this GoBot abortion

08:17.166 --> 08:19.625
back to whatever dimension
Max Headroom lives in.

08:22.875 --> 08:26.500
Ya ain't even going to ask
where I was for 20 years?

08:26.583 --> 08:29.250
Well, at least you ain't lost your figure.

08:29.333 --> 08:31.208
Playing hard to get, huh?

08:31.291 --> 08:35.958
You know that makes me stiffer
than Meemaw's peanut brittle. Crunch.

08:36.041 --> 08:37.000
Hello, Diddy.

08:37.083 --> 08:39.833
Check out my moustache!

08:39.916 --> 08:41.166
See, I went to the doctor

08:41.250 --> 08:44.833
and found out I had
a testosterone level of negative one.

08:44.916 --> 08:47.583
So the doctor shot me up with a bunch.

08:47.666 --> 08:50.625
Now I got this moustache, I got bacne,

08:50.708 --> 08:53.750
and these cute little,
teeny-weeny testicles.

08:55.333 --> 09:00.333
So I guess I can help myself to one
of your delicious-looking lemon bars.

09:00.416 --> 09:02.000
You call that a moustache?

09:02.083 --> 09:05.166
If you wanna impress me,
you'd be better off crushing some puss.

09:05.250 --> 09:06.875
'Cause that moustache ain't gonna do it.

09:06.958 --> 09:09.208
Your momma's got more hair on her asshole.

09:14.458 --> 09:16.291
Oh shit. She's dead as hell.

09:16.375 --> 09:17.541
Get the paddles!

09:18.125 --> 09:19.458
Wake up, Momma, goddamn it!

09:21.375 --> 09:23.875
As much as I enjoyed
buying you that $400 dinner

09:23.958 --> 09:26.208
that's not biologically
possible for you to eat,

09:26.291 --> 09:29.083
do you think maybe
I could at least get a hand job now?

09:29.166 --> 09:31.625
I-I'll do all the work
since you can't move your hands.

09:31.708 --> 09:33.208
<i>Oh, here we go.</i>

09:33.291 --> 09:36.208
<i>All you want from me is sex, sex, sex.</i>

09:36.291 --> 09:38.416
<i>You don't even care about what I want.</i>

09:38.500 --> 09:40.625
I care. What <i>do</i> you want?

09:40.708 --> 09:42.041
<i>Thank you, AFKAK.</i>

09:42.125 --> 09:46.541
<i>I've always wanted to take online classes</i>
<i>to become a marine biologist.</i>

09:46.625 --> 09:50.291
Fifteen thousand a semester
is nothing to keep my sex doll happy.

09:50.375 --> 09:52.416
So, do you think tonight we could--

09:52.500 --> 09:56.875
<i>Sorry. I'm really stressed out</i>
<i>from school. Stress. Stress.</i>

10:00.375 --> 10:02.291
Delivery for AFKAK Crawford.

10:03.875 --> 10:05.125
I didn't order this.

10:05.208 --> 10:06.375
<i>Oh. He's for me.</i>

10:06.458 --> 10:08.708
<i>That's Chad. He's here to help me study.</i>

10:08.791 --> 10:10.750
-<i>Sup, bro?</i>
-<i>Okay, Chad.</i>

10:10.833 --> 10:13.708
<i>You and I better go up to the bedroom</i>
<i>so we can get to it.</i>

10:15.000 --> 10:15.833
Oh.

10:21.791 --> 10:24.833
Uh-huh. Well,
this dating profile should be easy.

10:24.916 --> 10:29.208
Interests. Puss and the crushing of puss,

10:29.291 --> 10:31.750
shutting that puss down,

10:31.833 --> 10:34.500
annihilating that puss,

10:34.583 --> 10:40.416
making that puss uninhabitable
for a thousand years,

10:40.500 --> 10:42.541
and feminism.

10:42.625 --> 10:47.041
Randall, you fucking idiot!
How could you arrest Elon Musk?

10:47.125 --> 10:49.166
That jerk-off was Elon Musk?

10:49.250 --> 10:52.791
Well, why didn't you tell me
he was gonna be driving a GoBot abortion?

10:52.875 --> 10:55.625
I already used that one,
but you didn't hear it.

10:55.708 --> 10:57.333
Mr. Musk, I am so sorry

10:57.416 --> 10:59.958
your tour of Paradise got off
on the wrong foot.

11:00.041 --> 11:03.333
I really wanted you
to meet some of our fine citizens.

11:03.416 --> 11:05.291
Dobby Dobby. Hoo-ah!

11:05.791 --> 11:08.041
I just hope this doesn't mean
that you're gonna leave town.

11:08.125 --> 11:11.583
Of course not.
I'm not one to hold grudges.

11:11.666 --> 11:12.750
Breaking news.

11:12.833 --> 11:16.041
Elon Musk tweets that from now on,
he's going to dedicate all of his time

11:16.125 --> 11:18.166
as well as all of Tesla's available cash

11:18.250 --> 11:20.708
to ruining the life of a small-town yokel.

11:20.791 --> 11:23.250
And since we live
in a universe where nothing matters,

11:23.333 --> 11:26.000
Tesla stock is up 15%.

11:26.083 --> 11:30.083
Man, I love elevators.
Nothing ever goes wrong in elevators.

11:33.041 --> 11:35.666
Oh no! Your foreskin is stuck in the door!

11:35.750 --> 11:38.333
Daddy! Help!

11:48.916 --> 11:50.916
-Told ya.
-I guess I'm still dreaming.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.333
I guess I'm having the same dream.

11:54.416 --> 11:56.958
I need to get a new agent.

11:57.041 --> 11:59.541
You do one tsunami joke,

11:59.625 --> 12:04.458
and you wind up in bed with a giant cock!

12:06.541 --> 12:09.833
So, what kind of cut do you want?
The buzz cut or the high-and-tight?

12:09.916 --> 12:11.958
I don't know. Give him what you have.

12:12.041 --> 12:13.625
Ooh, fun. The Rachel.

12:13.708 --> 12:15.041
-Ah!

12:15.750 --> 12:16.583
There we are.

12:16.666 --> 12:18.750
Uh, just so you know,
I've done thousands of these,

12:18.833 --> 12:21.166
and I always dispose of them properly.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.083
Pee-yoop!

12:29.875 --> 12:32.416
Pee-yoop. Pee-yoop. Pee-yoop.

12:32.500 --> 12:35.375
Actually, can I have those?
Got a lot of McRibs to make.

12:39.500 --> 12:42.458
-<i>Harder! Harder! I need the D!</i>

12:42.541 --> 12:44.750
The D? She's been studying all day.

12:44.833 --> 12:46.666
You think she'd be aiming
for at least a B-plus.

12:47.250 --> 12:49.583
I thought you study buddies
may need a snack.

12:49.666 --> 12:52.041
Oh. Your mouth's already
full of Chad's asshole.

12:52.875 --> 12:54.583
Wait a minute.

12:54.666 --> 12:55.875
You're cheating on me?

12:55.958 --> 12:58.625
So that's why you asked me
to lay Chad on top of you.

12:58.708 --> 13:00.541
Not so he could see the book better.

13:00.625 --> 13:03.166
<i>AFKAK, I'm going</i>
<i>through a phase right now.</i>

13:03.250 --> 13:07.041
<i>You just need to give me a lot</i>
<i>of time alone with Chad to figure it out.</i>

13:10.041 --> 13:11.875
Delivery for AFKAK Crawford.

13:14.166 --> 13:15.333
This isn't mine.

13:15.416 --> 13:17.333
<i>Should have pulled me out, bro!</i>

13:19.416 --> 13:23.291
Oh, this is perfect. Why do they have
to make <i>The Family Circus</i> mom so hot?

13:23.375 --> 13:24.875
Now I gotta shit with a boner.

13:26.666 --> 13:28.750
What the hell is Space Ten?

13:37.375 --> 13:40.541
<i>My dream</i>
<i>is to send a man into space</i>

13:40.625 --> 13:43.041
<i>on a toilet while shitting</i>

13:43.125 --> 13:47.916
<i>with an erection caused</i>
<i>by the hot mom from </i>Family Circus<i>.</i>

13:48.000 --> 13:52.333
<i>Not because it is easy,</i>
<i>but because it is hard.</i>

13:52.416 --> 13:55.291
<i>Almost as hard as shitting with a boner.</i>

14:01.625 --> 14:02.916
One McRib, please.

14:07.125 --> 14:08.125
Mmm!

14:08.625 --> 14:12.291
Wait a minute. This doesn't taste
like sawdust and foreskins!

14:12.375 --> 14:14.208
How's your McRib, Randall?

14:14.291 --> 14:17.166
This ain't no McRib.
Musk, what have you done?

14:17.250 --> 14:18.166
Oh, nothing.

14:18.250 --> 14:22.916
I just bought McDonald's and replaced
the McRib patties with real meat.

14:23.500 --> 14:26.041
No! You fucking maniac!

14:28.125 --> 14:29.625
Morning, Brozoners.

14:29.708 --> 14:31.541
Anyone else feeling weird today?

14:31.625 --> 14:32.958
Musk!

14:33.041 --> 14:35.416
He switched my consciousness
with a squirrel!

14:38.000 --> 14:39.666
There's my body. Get it!

14:39.750 --> 14:41.750
Bark! Uh, bark! Fuck. Bark!

14:41.833 --> 14:46.125
No, no! Don't run him up a tree!
Now he's on the power line!

14:47.250 --> 14:51.000
Hey! Don't chew through the power line,
you stupid asshole!

14:52.666 --> 14:53.958
Hey! I'm back.

14:54.041 --> 14:54.875
Oh fuck.

14:58.916 --> 15:02.125
Man. Thank God
this side table broke my fall.

15:05.250 --> 15:06.958
You wanted to see me?

15:07.041 --> 15:08.791
Yeah, to tell you that I give up.

15:08.875 --> 15:11.750
That squirrel you put in my body
really screwed me over.

15:11.833 --> 15:13.541
-Ow!

15:13.625 --> 15:16.250
What? I did not fuck your wife!
That was not me!

15:17.458 --> 15:19.166
Right back at you, asshole.

15:19.250 --> 15:22.333
And tell your bitch wife
thanks for the squirrel gonorrhea.

15:22.416 --> 15:23.958
Anyway.

15:24.041 --> 15:26.041
You win, Elon. Shake on it?

15:27.375 --> 15:29.083
Ha ha! Joke's on you!

15:29.166 --> 15:32.583
'Cause right before you got here,
I peed all over my hand.

15:32.666 --> 15:34.625
How does that feel, Pee-lon?

15:38.083 --> 15:39.083
Randall Crawford.

15:39.166 --> 15:41.958
-How did you squirrels get this number?

15:42.041 --> 15:44.041
-You out of your mind?

15:44.125 --> 15:47.083
I'm not paying you three acorns a month
in child support.

15:47.166 --> 15:50.125
-Well, I'll see you in squirrel court!

15:52.208 --> 15:53.041
Gah!

15:53.125 --> 15:57.583
Where the hell are all my Franklin Mint
commemorative rooster plates?

15:57.666 --> 16:00.833
I swear, if Dusty chipped
one of those plates,

16:00.916 --> 16:03.750
I'll kick him right in his cute
little, teeny-weeny testicles!

16:03.833 --> 16:05.708
Diddy, meet my girlfriend.

16:05.791 --> 16:11.083
I spent $10,000 on new clothes,
took hours of pickup artist classes,

16:11.166 --> 16:14.208
and when that didn't work,
I found a girl with no taste.

16:14.291 --> 16:16.291
Or sight, hearing, smell, or touch.

16:16.375 --> 16:20.333
Well, she sure ain't like
the high-class tens that I pull.

16:21.708 --> 16:25.708
Goddamn! Are you shitting
in a Pringles can again?

16:25.791 --> 16:29.166
Anyway, Dusty,
did you at least crush her puss?

16:29.250 --> 16:31.208
Oh, I crushed way more than that.

16:32.458 --> 16:35.000
Not impressed. No lemon bars for you.

16:35.083 --> 16:36.541
You ain't a tough man like your diddy

16:36.625 --> 16:39.458
till you go back in time
and kick a dinosaur's ass.

16:39.541 --> 16:41.125
What? You ain't never done that.

16:41.208 --> 16:43.875
How you think them bitches went extinct?

16:45.958 --> 16:48.625
Oh shit. Bullet will be home any second.

16:48.708 --> 16:50.958
If he finds out
I had your schmeckle snipped,

16:51.041 --> 16:52.250
he's gonna kill me.

16:52.333 --> 16:54.208
Well, maybe he won't notice.

16:54.291 --> 16:56.125
Doggy Daddy's home!

16:56.208 --> 16:58.791
Now, get over here
and let Daddy sniff your ass and penis.

16:59.958 --> 17:03.291
Fitz, why is our son
wearing a bloody diaper?

17:03.375 --> 17:05.958
Uh… The McRib is back?

17:06.041 --> 17:08.083
Whatever. Take it off.
It's family bath time.

17:08.166 --> 17:10.958
Bullet, why don't the two of us
do family bath time tonight

17:11.041 --> 17:12.833
and leave Junior out of it?

17:12.916 --> 17:16.500
Two grown men in a bath
without a small boy? That'd be weird.

17:18.375 --> 17:22.125
What the fuck is this?
You got him circumcised behind my back!

17:22.208 --> 17:26.000
Now, Bullet, I-I know it was wrong,
but I had a good reason.

17:26.083 --> 17:27.416
I had a scary dream.

17:27.500 --> 17:29.083
Look at what you've done, Fitz.

17:29.166 --> 17:31.208
Now his lipstick
won't even go back in the tube.

17:31.291 --> 17:34.000
Looks like a melted red crayon
peeking out of a half-eaten cannoli.

17:34.083 --> 17:37.083
You're right, Bullet.
Shit looks like red Hulk in a turtleneck.

17:37.166 --> 17:39.791
I shouldn't have gone behind your back.
How can I make this right?

17:39.875 --> 17:42.791
We're going to get my son's foreskin back.

17:45.916 --> 17:48.833
-Look, Bullet. A free can of Pringles.

17:49.458 --> 17:51.208
Oh my God!

17:52.083 --> 17:53.833
Focus, for Christ's sake.

17:53.916 --> 17:56.041
Junior's foreskin
has to be here somewhere.

18:00.291 --> 18:03.500
Oh, there it is. On top
of that monster made out of foreskins.

18:10.666 --> 18:12.708
I told you this was gonna happen.

18:12.791 --> 18:14.875
What? No, you did not!

18:18.708 --> 18:20.208
Well, I'll be damned.

18:20.291 --> 18:22.583
Here, monster! Free Pringles!

18:25.458 --> 18:27.875
Oh my God!

18:38.041 --> 18:41.250
Stacey, could you maybe
take a shift with your baby?

18:41.333 --> 18:42.791
I've been up all night with him.

18:42.875 --> 18:45.916
<i>Sorry.</i>
<i>We're studying so hard in here.</i>

18:49.458 --> 18:51.333
Delivery for AFKAK Crawford.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.791
<i>We're Stacey's parents.</i>

18:57.875 --> 19:01.000
<i>We're moving in</i>
<i>to spend time with our grandbaby.</i>

19:01.083 --> 19:02.833
Okay.

19:05.125 --> 19:07.166
You are insatiable!

19:07.250 --> 19:08.875
And I fucking dig it.

19:15.041 --> 19:16.625
Please don't kill us!

19:17.416 --> 19:22.291
Whoa! I'm offended you'd assume
I'm that kind of foreskin monster.

19:22.375 --> 19:25.625
Uh, all right. Take it easy.
We didn't mean anything by it.

19:25.708 --> 19:27.541
Sorry, I'm very sensitive.

19:29.708 --> 19:30.541
Gross.

19:30.625 --> 19:32.333
So why'd you chase us?

19:32.416 --> 19:36.125
Are you here to teach us a lesson
about the dangers of circumcision?

19:36.208 --> 19:37.541
Heck no!

19:37.625 --> 19:40.791
I'm here to tell you
about the benefits of…

19:41.833 --> 19:42.875
Herbalife.

19:42.958 --> 19:47.875
The highest quality supplements
on earth not approved by the FDA.

19:47.958 --> 19:51.000
I'm offering you
the once-in-a-lifetime chance

19:51.083 --> 19:54.208
to become Diamond-Level
Herbalife distributors.

19:54.291 --> 19:56.583
How successful could you be?
Well, look at me.

19:57.333 --> 20:01.000
This Toyota Celica
didn't buy its fucking self.

20:01.083 --> 20:04.416
If a foreskin monster
can make scratch like this,

20:04.500 --> 20:06.166
imagine what you could do.

20:06.250 --> 20:10.541
So the question is,
are you ready to say yes to success?

20:11.875 --> 20:14.041
See? This is why I'm against circumcision.

20:18.416 --> 20:21.166
What are you doing, Dusty?

20:21.250 --> 20:22.125
Oh hey, Hopson.

20:22.208 --> 20:23.583
I'm just building a time machine

20:23.666 --> 20:26.541
so I can kick a dinosaur's ass
just like my diddy did.

20:26.625 --> 20:29.958
I'm just a cum-loving old man,

20:30.041 --> 20:36.375
but to me, it seems like
your dad may be full of shit.

20:36.458 --> 20:40.708
How dare you!
My diddy is as honest as he is tough!

20:40.791 --> 20:44.250
Now, get lost, Hopson.
I'm doing quantum physics here.

20:44.333 --> 20:48.333
Run faster, you little bitch!
I need me 1.21 gerbil-watts!

20:48.416 --> 20:51.958
The hell did you do to Elon Musk?
He won't come out of his Cybertruck.

20:52.041 --> 20:54.000
He-- he's just sitting in there crying.

20:57.083 --> 20:58.875
You have to go and apologize.

20:58.958 --> 21:01.291
Maybe he should be
the one apologizing to me.

21:01.375 --> 21:04.583
I had to go to squirrel court
this morning, and it did not go well.

21:05.916 --> 21:10.375
Four acorns a month?
Are you crazy? Winter is coming.

21:15.458 --> 21:18.208
Don't worry about that.
Happens, like, every time.

21:18.291 --> 21:21.583
Hey, my wife's making me apologize
for calling you Pee-lon

21:21.666 --> 21:24.875
even though it was funny
as fuck, so, I'm sorry.

21:24.958 --> 21:26.791
You're not such a bad guy.

21:26.875 --> 21:28.083
For a pedo.

21:28.166 --> 21:29.666
What did you say?

21:29.750 --> 21:31.708
Pedo! Pedo! Pedo! Pedo!

21:33.750 --> 21:36.333
I am about to kick your weird little ass!

21:37.458 --> 21:38.375
Uncool.

21:38.458 --> 21:43.083
I think I'll show you one
of the special features of the Cybertruck.

21:57.041 --> 22:00.791
I am Iron Musk! It's pretty cool!

22:00.875 --> 22:02.000
Oh shit.

22:14.083 --> 22:15.833
-Squirrel Judge!

22:15.916 --> 22:17.541
No!

22:30.625 --> 22:31.625
Stacey,

22:31.708 --> 22:35.833
it's nice that all of your and Chad's
extended families decided to move in,

22:35.916 --> 22:37.916
but my apartment's getting
a little cramped.

22:39.791 --> 22:41.833
<i>I've been meaning</i>
<i>to talk to you about that.</i>

22:41.916 --> 22:44.958
<i>Honestly, it is a little weird</i>
<i>that you're here with my family.</i>

22:45.041 --> 22:48.166
<i>I think it would be best if you moved out,</i>
<i>but continued to pay the rent.</i>

22:48.250 --> 22:52.250
You're right. I didn't mean
to intrude on your life. I'll go.

22:53.250 --> 22:55.958
Before I go,
can I have sex with any of you?

22:56.041 --> 22:57.666
<i>We're on our periods!</i>

23:00.875 --> 23:02.250
Oh, isn't this nice?

23:02.333 --> 23:05.333
And you didn't want me
to cut you out of the house.

23:19.750 --> 23:20.666
Diddy, I did it!

23:20.750 --> 23:24.000
Dusty, I am blown away
that you went back in time.

23:24.083 --> 23:27.750
To fight the most
pussy-ass dinosaur ever!

23:27.833 --> 23:32.125
I would have fought one of them
Indominus rexes from <i>Jurassic Park World</i>.

23:32.208 --> 23:34.458
I guess you ain't never getting
no lemon bar.

23:36.291 --> 23:40.166
-I think I will have some lemon bars!

23:44.000 --> 23:45.958
Ooh! Hey, look!

23:46.041 --> 23:48.708
I found your goddamn
twat-sucking rooster plates

23:48.791 --> 23:50.875
that you love more than me,
you little asshole!

23:54.541 --> 23:56.458
Okay, you're right, son!

23:56.541 --> 23:58.666
I am a asshole.

23:58.750 --> 24:02.708
You know, I've been putting you down
to make up for my own insecurities.

24:02.791 --> 24:06.458
Takes a real tough man
to stand up to his diddy like that.

24:06.541 --> 24:07.708
That's all I wanted.

24:07.791 --> 24:11.291
Well, that and them lemon bars,
but I already ate the shit out of them.

24:11.375 --> 24:14.750
You think one day I could be
in the Strawberry Action Squad with you

24:14.833 --> 24:17.375
and the talking squid
and that radioactive werewolf?

24:17.458 --> 24:22.083
Son, I have to tell you something.
I haven't been completely honest with you.

24:23.458 --> 24:24.958
This moustache is fake.

24:32.708 --> 24:34.583
Special Sergeant Strawberry!

24:34.666 --> 24:39.583
We need you for another 20-year mission
of killing bad guys and crushing puss!

24:40.958 --> 24:43.291
Well, my country needs me, son.

24:54.375 --> 24:57.541
You are one petty asshole. You know that?

24:57.625 --> 24:59.666
Oh yeah? So are you.

24:59.750 --> 25:02.125
Really? Well, maybe
it's 'cause I'm insecure.

25:02.208 --> 25:04.583
Maybe that's my problem too!

25:04.666 --> 25:08.416
Maybe, deep down inside, I hate myself.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.083
Maybe I hate myself too.

25:17.125 --> 25:19.541
You're watching footage
of Elon Musk hate-fucking

25:19.625 --> 25:23.041
what appears to be Rob Riggle
in the middle of a crowded street.

25:23.125 --> 25:24.875
And Tesla stock plummeted.

25:24.958 --> 25:26.958
In a dimension where things make sense.

25:27.041 --> 25:31.916
But in our upside-down shit world,
Tesla stock is at an all-time high.
