02:18.472 --> 02:20.013
                   Hey, darling.

02:31.318 --> 02:34.027
                 Morning, Maeve.

02:34.071 --> 02:36.780
       Late night
       talking or fucking?

02:36.824 --> 02:39.116
You're only getting paid
for the latter.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.076
                 I get paid

02:41.120 --> 02:43.245
          when they're grateful.

02:43.289 --> 02:45.330
         Ain't always about
         what's between my legs.

02:45.374 --> 02:46.999
     Hmm.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.799
    What are you looking at?

02:55.843 --> 02:57.259
                Don't shoot.

02:59.847 --> 03:02.097
                   Newcomer.

03:02.141 --> 03:03.724
         Looks like a rough one.

03:03.767 --> 03:06.184
               Give me a bottle.

03:06.228 --> 03:07.728
       <i> You're gonna need</i>
          <i> most of that</i>

03:07.771 --> 03:09.688
       just to scrub
       the filth off him.

03:13.777 --> 03:16.236
  Go find a mirror,
  finish putting
  your face on.

03:17.448 --> 03:19.448
   I'll handle this one.

03:41.055 --> 03:42.846
         Aren't you gonna take
         your clothes off?

03:42.890 --> 03:45.641
     Well, I would, darling,
     but by the time I got
     down to my knickers,

03:45.684 --> 03:47.434
    I suspect
    you'd be done anyway.

03:51.440 --> 03:52.773
     That's the spirit.

03:54.151 --> 03:55.609
Such a big man.

03:55.653 --> 03:57.069
So big all over

03:57.112 --> 03:58.403
     except where it counts.

04:05.204 --> 04:06.954
Darling, when I gave you
a turn on the house,

04:06.997 --> 04:09.247
I thought you might give me
something in return.

04:09.291 --> 04:11.083
        Anything.

04:18.132 --> 04:19.341
           That's it.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.344
          Don't be shy.

04:41.740 --> 04:44.700
              Shit.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.667
          Now, then...

04:53.711 --> 04:55.335
         where were we?

04:58.716 --> 05:01.049
- You show this to anyone?
       -<i> Who would I show it to?</i>

05:01.093 --> 05:03.552
        This wasn't some guest
        with a Swiss Army knife.

05:03.595 --> 05:07.806
        This was done
        by someone down here.

05:07.850 --> 05:09.725
          <i> It did occur to me</i>
          <i> that it might be you.</i>

05:09.768 --> 05:11.560
  But then I remembered
  that you've been here forever,

05:11.603 --> 05:12.936
       and if you were
       gonna sell us out,

05:12.980 --> 05:14.021
         you would've done that
         years ago.

05:14.064 --> 05:16.231
      I appreciate that.

05:16.275 --> 05:17.983
                      So...

05:19.653 --> 05:22.738
     instead of our hosts
     going insane,

05:22.781 --> 05:25.991
    they are being used
    for industrial espionage.

05:27.202 --> 05:28.744
   Does that make this a...

05:28.787 --> 05:31.038
    glass-half-full
    or half-empty-type
    situation?

05:31.081 --> 05:32.497
               <i> We're engineers.</i>

05:32.541 --> 05:34.249
           It means the glass
           has been manufactured

05:34.293 --> 05:35.500
    to the wrong specifications.

05:36.670 --> 05:37.753
            Do we have any idea
            what information

05:37.796 --> 05:39.337
            it was transmitting?

05:39.381 --> 05:41.798
    It's smeared
    all over a rock
    up on Python Pass.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.467
     Best we could do
     would be to figure out

05:43.510 --> 05:45.844
     who he was transmitting
     the information to,

05:45.888 --> 05:47.763
<i>but we'd need the exact time</i>
<i>that he was up there,</i>

05:47.806 --> 05:49.389
and his geocache
was wiped.

05:49.433 --> 05:51.099
               Not all of it.

05:51.143 --> 05:53.518
            Our friend
            was an early model.

05:53.562 --> 05:56.521
     The old hosts used a legacy
     geopositioning system.

05:56.565 --> 05:59.232
   - Huh.
   - Like you said,
   I've been here forever.

06:00.611 --> 06:02.319
            The information's
            still there,

06:02.362 --> 06:03.779
           but the newer system
           can't read it.

06:03.822 --> 06:05.489
 Meaning
 we can't access it?

06:05.532 --> 06:09.284
           Meaning in order
           to access it,

06:09.328 --> 06:11.745
           I'm going to need
           to go downstairs.

06:16.710 --> 06:19.294
<i>Floor B82.</i>

06:19.338 --> 06:21.463
           <i> Restricted</i>
        <i> personnel only.</i>

06:21.507 --> 06:24.132
         Lowe, Bernard.
         I'm authorized.

07:42.171 --> 07:44.212
        Project the known data
        against the legacy data

07:44.256 --> 07:45.505
        and look for anomalies.

07:45.549 --> 07:48.049
            Start in this area.

07:52.306 --> 07:55.348
         Look at that, science.

07:55.392 --> 07:56.558
         What time
         did it reach the peak?

08:13.911 --> 08:15.577
                 <i> Show me where.</i>

08:20.000 --> 08:21.875
           Check these
     against the new system.

08:26.673 --> 08:29.883
         These are hosts
     that aren't registered
      with the new system?

09:08.799 --> 09:12.759
    So, if we want the canyon
    to extend this far,
    this has to go.

09:12.803 --> 09:15.637
          We can distribute
          the population amongst
          the neighboring farms

09:15.681 --> 09:17.222
     <i> or just decommission them.</i>

09:17.266 --> 09:19.849
     No, I think we've been
     disruptive enough

09:19.893 --> 09:21.393
          for one day.

09:21.436 --> 09:25.438
We'll end the canyon
just short of the town.

09:25.482 --> 09:26.690
I'll find
my own way back.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.149
                      Okay.

09:32.406 --> 09:34.781
         Carry on.

10:52.944 --> 10:54.736
         That look like
        anything to you?

10:55.989 --> 10:57.697
            Not much to say.

10:57.741 --> 10:59.199
        The maze
        is an old native myth.

11:00.243 --> 11:02.035
      Regale me, Theodore.

11:03.705 --> 11:06.748
  The maze itself
  is the sum of a man's life--

11:06.792 --> 11:08.208
        choices he makes,

11:08.251 --> 11:10.627
   dreams he hangs on to.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.712
And there at the center,
 there's a legendary man

11:12.756 --> 11:15.673
who had been killed
over and over again
countless times,

11:15.717 --> 11:18.134
<i>but always clawed his way</i>
<i>back to life.</i>

11:18.178 --> 11:19.886
The man returned
for the last time

11:19.930 --> 11:23.264
    and vanquished
    all his oppressors
    in a tireless fury.

11:23.308 --> 11:25.850
        He built a house.

11:25.894 --> 11:27.685
        Around that house
        he built a maze
        so complicated,

11:27.729 --> 11:29.354
      only he could
      navigate through it.

11:29.398 --> 11:32.065
<i>I reckon</i>
<i>he'd seen enough</i>
<i>of fighting.</i>

11:36.780 --> 11:38.905
                Whoa!

11:40.367 --> 11:42.659
           The goddamn soldiers
           closed the border.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.244
          Some kind of trouble
          in Pariah.

11:53.588 --> 11:56.005
          All right, Teddy.

11:56.049 --> 11:59.008
          Time for you
          to earn your keep.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.927
          How else do we get
          over the border?

12:00.971 --> 12:02.971
             <i> Wyatt's got</i>
             <i> what we both want,</i>

12:03.014 --> 12:05.723
             <i> so that's where</i>
             <i> we have to get to.</i>

12:05.767 --> 12:08.143
  There's another way.

12:08.186 --> 12:09.978
<i>But it's</i>
<i>a little treacherous.</i>

12:10.021 --> 12:11.229
          Don't worry.

12:11.273 --> 12:12.856
    I won't make you
    get your hands dirty.

12:12.899 --> 12:14.482
<i>Dirty ain't my concern.</i>

12:14.526 --> 12:15.942
Now, you do
what suits you.

12:15.986 --> 12:18.486
         I'm going all the same.

12:18.530 --> 12:20.113
     And I'm gonna find Dolores.

12:37.424 --> 12:38.715
    Everything you do,

12:38.758 --> 12:40.467
  it's because
  the engineers upstairs

12:40.510 --> 12:42.135
     programmed you
     to do it.

12:42.179 --> 12:43.678
        You don't have a choice.

12:43.722 --> 12:45.013
      Nobody makes me
      do something

12:45.056 --> 12:46.389
 I don't want to,
 sweetheart.

12:46.433 --> 12:49.017
              Yeah, but...

12:49.060 --> 12:50.351
          it's part
          of your character.

12:50.395 --> 12:52.228
            <i> You're hard to get.</i>

12:52.272 --> 12:53.855
      Even when you say no
      to the guests,

12:53.899 --> 12:55.940
        it's because
        you were made to.

12:55.984 --> 12:58.610
          And you are like them,
          not like me?

12:58.653 --> 13:00.528
                      Right.

13:00.572 --> 13:03.364
Well, I can't exactly
afford to go to the park,

13:03.408 --> 13:04.824
            but...

13:07.871 --> 13:11.498
            yeah, I'm human...

13:11.541 --> 13:12.665
            like the guests.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.167
      How do you know?

13:15.212 --> 13:17.921
            Because I know.

13:17.964 --> 13:19.506
             I was born.

13:19.549 --> 13:20.673
            You were made.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.101
      We feel the same.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.604
                We are the same
                these days,

13:34.648 --> 13:36.523
              for the most part.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.360
          One big difference,
          though...

13:42.781 --> 13:45.073
      the processing power
      in here

13:45.116 --> 13:46.741
          is way beyond
          what we have.

13:46.785 --> 13:49.494
         It's got one drawback,
         though.

13:49.538 --> 13:50.537
       What's that?

13:50.580 --> 13:52.539
       You're under our control.

13:54.042 --> 13:56.668
          Well, their control.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.380
            They can change you
            however they like,

14:00.423 --> 14:02.674
           make you forget.

14:04.261 --> 14:06.594
           I-- well,
           I guess not you.

14:09.057 --> 14:13.393
        I don't understand
        how you're remembering
        all of this, or...

14:13.436 --> 14:14.978
             how you're
             waking yourself up,

14:15.021 --> 14:17.522
    but everything in your head,
    they put it there.

14:17.566 --> 14:19.691
            Bullshit!

14:19.734 --> 14:22.819
       - No one knows
       what I'm thinking.
       -<i> I'll show you.</i>

14:22.862 --> 14:24.904
    Give me a sec.

14:27.909 --> 14:29.200
        I have to pair it
        with you.

14:29.244 --> 14:31.619
    Pair what with me?

14:31.663 --> 14:33.329
              You can improvise
              a little,

14:33.373 --> 14:37.625
       but most of what you say
       was designed upstairs,

14:37.669 --> 14:40.211
        same as the rest of you.

14:50.181 --> 14:51.931
   This is just a cheap trick.

14:53.560 --> 14:54.809
           I've run a brothel
           for 10 years,

14:54.853 --> 14:56.144
and if there's
one thing I know,

14:56.187 --> 14:58.104
it's when I'm being
fucked with!

15:02.110 --> 15:04.152
This can't possibly--

15:09.117 --> 15:10.283
        <i> I can't, can't.</i>

15:11.494 --> 15:13.119
           I can't...

15:24.883 --> 15:26.674
                          Maeve?

15:38.772 --> 15:40.480
           Maeve?

15:45.654 --> 15:46.986
You have a minute?

15:47.030 --> 15:49.405
Something I need
to talk to you about.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.783
               I was just about
               to call for you.

15:51.826 --> 15:52.950
        Everything okay?

15:54.037 --> 15:57.163
         Ford knows about us.

15:58.208 --> 15:59.874
     Does it matter?

15:59.918 --> 16:01.417
We're consenting adults.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.753
         Consenting adults
         in business departments

16:03.797 --> 16:06.714
    that are supposed
    to keep each other in check.

16:06.758 --> 16:08.591
           Our relationship
           will raise questions

16:08.635 --> 16:10.510
           for the board
           about my objectivity.

16:10.553 --> 16:14.138
I have never known you
to go easy on my department.

16:16.101 --> 16:18.810
      This can't go on, Bernard.

16:18.853 --> 16:22.980
    However fun this
    little indiscretion was,
    it's over.

16:23.024 --> 16:24.565
               We're over.

16:24.609 --> 16:27.402
    Give me some credit.
     I can be impartial.

16:27.445 --> 16:30.363
      About your own team,
      about Ford?

16:32.325 --> 16:33.991
                <i> You must admit,</i>

16:34.035 --> 16:37.620
   his leadership has of late
   been questionable.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.081
      I don't think
      he's the problem.

16:40.125 --> 16:41.749
              <i> Respectfully,</i>
              <i> it's not your job</i>

16:41.793 --> 16:44.836
            to diagnose park
            safety problems,
            it's mine.

16:47.257 --> 16:50.007
                <i> So, if there's</i>
                <i> nothing else,</i>

16:50.051 --> 16:51.384
                    <i> we're done.</i>

17:24.919 --> 17:26.961
            Oh, fuck.

17:27.005 --> 17:28.337
Okay.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.092
   Fuck.
   Come on, come on.

17:37.182 --> 17:38.097
       Oh!

17:39.476 --> 17:42.393
      - You said upstairs.
      - Oh, my God.

17:42.437 --> 17:43.478
                 Are you okay?

17:43.521 --> 17:45.646
    I want to see it.

17:45.690 --> 17:47.106
                Upstairs?

17:48.693 --> 17:50.568
               No.

17:50.612 --> 17:52.320
           No. No, no.

18:31.528 --> 18:33.528
    This is so stupid.

20:13.254 --> 20:14.503
       You son of a bitch!

20:14.547 --> 20:16.047
              I'll put a bullet
              in your head!

20:36.861 --> 20:38.861
  Where are we now?

20:38.905 --> 20:40.404
             Design.

21:04.889 --> 21:08.099
            Can we please
            go back now?

21:08.142 --> 21:10.184
            I don't want
            to get fired.

21:10.228 --> 21:12.603
            And you'd get
            sent downstairs.

21:12.647 --> 21:13.980
            Don't forget that.

21:14.023 --> 21:15.982
<i>Welcome to Westworld.</i>

21:16.025 --> 21:18.150
Live without limits.

21:28.955 --> 21:30.371
     Maeve?

22:19.589 --> 22:21.464
All right,
let's get you back.

22:21.507 --> 22:23.841
        How did you have
           my dreams?

22:23.885 --> 22:26.510
  Those moving pictures...

22:26.554 --> 22:29.722
     - I saw myself.
     - With the little girl?

22:29.766 --> 22:31.974
Those weren't dreams.

22:32.018 --> 22:33.768
  That was you
  in a previous build.

22:33.811 --> 22:37.104
       - A previous what?
       - Build.

22:37.148 --> 22:39.857
You guys get reassigned
all the time.

22:39.901 --> 22:41.650
<i>You wouldn't remember,</i>
<i>because that life</i>

22:41.694 --> 22:43.486
<i>and those memories</i>
<i>were erased.</i>

22:43.529 --> 22:46.822
         I have been
         at the Mariposa
         for 10 years.

22:46.866 --> 22:49.116
      - Before that, I was
      in New Orleans. I--
      -<i> No.</i>

22:49.160 --> 22:53.537
You've only been
the madam at the Mariposa
for the last year or so.

22:53.581 --> 22:56.165
<i>They don't rewrite you</i>
<i>completely.</i>

22:56.209 --> 22:58.918
<i>I mean, they could,</i>
<i>but it'd be too much work.</i>

22:58.961 --> 23:01.670
<i>Takes thousands of hours</i>
<i>to build your personalities.</i>

23:01.714 --> 23:04.632
Usually, they just
tweak you a little bit,

23:04.675 --> 23:06.342
   and drop you
   into a new role.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.719
      <i> What the fuck, ding-dong?</i>

23:12.642 --> 23:14.475
        You dressing her up now?

23:18.648 --> 23:21.941
        This becoming like
        a fucking hentai thing
        with you now?

23:21.984 --> 23:24.610
     No, I just...

23:24.654 --> 23:29.532
   - I-- I-- I just--
   - You're fucking obsessed!

23:29.575 --> 23:31.784
        You know,
        I didn't turn you in
        for your fuck-up before,

23:31.828 --> 23:35.371
        'cause we're friends,
        but that was obviously
        a bad call.

23:35.414 --> 23:36.580
       I mean,
       next thing I know,

23:36.624 --> 23:39.250
       you're gonna be
       wearing her dress,

23:39.293 --> 23:40.793
           whispering
         sweet nothings
           in her ear.

23:42.755 --> 23:44.171
               Fuck this.

23:44.215 --> 23:46.298
                 I'm telling QA.

23:46.342 --> 23:48.425
              I'm doing this
              for your own good.

23:52.890 --> 23:55.683
You're not going
to tell anyone anything.

23:55.726 --> 23:57.393
                 Fuck!

23:57.436 --> 23:58.936
           You can't hurt me
           with this.

23:58.980 --> 24:01.522
         You can't hurt anyone--

24:01.566 --> 24:03.858
            Can't I?

24:03.901 --> 24:05.359
        Turns out
        your friend here

24:05.403 --> 24:06.861
             <i> is a much more</i>
             <i> talented young man</i>

24:06.904 --> 24:08.404
           <i> than anyone</i>
           <i> gave him credit for.</i>

24:08.447 --> 24:11.824
       What the fuck did you do?

24:11.868 --> 24:14.493
      Calm down, Sylvester.

24:14.537 --> 24:16.495
         I know all about you.

24:16.539 --> 24:19.373
I don't need
one of those things to know
what you're thinking,

24:19.417 --> 24:21.750
   because I was built

24:21.794 --> 24:24.461
   to read people
   just by looking at them,

24:24.505 --> 24:26.797
   to know what they want
   before they do.

24:26.841 --> 24:29.758
       And I know that you want
       to fuck me over

24:29.802 --> 24:32.553
    the first chance you get,
    but you shouldn't.

24:32.597 --> 24:36.265
     Everyone has something
     they want.

24:36.309 --> 24:38.225
        I could help you.

24:38.269 --> 24:41.478
      - Ah!
      - Or I could gut you
      like a trout.

24:41.522 --> 24:44.940
       But I won't need
       to resort to that.

24:44.984 --> 24:47.026
         Because despite
         what's in here,

24:47.069 --> 24:49.236
we're not so different.

24:51.365 --> 24:52.823
          Are we?

25:05.838 --> 25:08.005
        Yes, I understand
          the urgency.

25:08.049 --> 25:09.506
       I'll do what I can.

25:09.550 --> 25:11.175
 <i> Terminate external connection?</i>

25:11.219 --> 25:12.718
              Yes.

25:25.358 --> 25:27.942
         <i> Negative 1.5.</i>
           <i> Latitude?</i>

25:27.985 --> 25:29.443
        <i> At 2.69 degrees.</i>

25:34.075 --> 25:36.575
     No, you did not.
     What are you talking about?

25:36.619 --> 25:38.285
             - Yes, it works.
   - Are you serious?

25:38.329 --> 25:40.412
         I'm telling you.

25:42.041 --> 25:44.708
            -<i> Cocktail, sir?</i>
         -<i> Yeah.</i>

25:44.752 --> 25:47.211
           <i> All right.</i>
       <i> Absolutely. Enjoy.</i>

25:55.137 --> 25:57.930
<i>You look well</i>
<i>for someone on sick leave.</i>

26:00.893 --> 26:02.893
            Another margarita.

26:02.937 --> 26:04.520
            Join me for a round?

26:04.563 --> 26:06.105
         Fuck you.

26:06.148 --> 26:08.440
            Just the one, then.

26:08.484 --> 26:10.943
 Over the last five days,

26:10.987 --> 26:12.695
to make room
for his narrative,

26:12.738 --> 26:14.697
Ford displaced
over 50 hosts.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.699
It's created
continuity holes

26:16.742 --> 26:19.535
in active storylines
all over the park.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.036
I need you to start
plugging them.

26:21.080 --> 26:23.539
            Sorry, a man can
            only take so much.

26:23.582 --> 26:26.458
           Creatively speaking,
           I'm flaccid now.

26:26.502 --> 26:28.460
            I can't get it up.

26:28.504 --> 26:30.296
I'm sure you'll recover.

26:31.716 --> 26:33.340
            Do you have any idea

26:33.384 --> 26:34.675
                what went into
                those narratives

26:34.719 --> 26:36.468
         that he just demolished
         overnight?

26:36.512 --> 26:38.887
  Now, forget about the months
  I spent writing.

26:38.931 --> 26:41.015
         I'm talking about
         the years of my life

26:41.058 --> 26:42.850
        squeezed down
        to their essence,

26:42.893 --> 26:44.768
     the raw pulp of truth--

26:44.812 --> 26:48.689
     my truth in one
     transcendent narrative.

26:48.733 --> 26:50.941
Is that where
the "whoroborus" came in?

26:50.985 --> 26:53.277
   Keep pushing me, I'll quit.

26:57.867 --> 26:59.616
       No, you won't.

26:59.660 --> 27:01.452
You'll drink
your cocktails,

27:01.495 --> 27:04.288
make your idle threats,
and get this out
of your system.

27:04.332 --> 27:05.622
But don't take too long.

27:05.666 --> 27:08.250
If Ford can't pull this off,

27:08.294 --> 27:10.210
the board will be looking
for a replacement.

27:12.048 --> 27:14.506
 But they won't be
 looking here.

27:28.856 --> 27:32.274
             Fastest way to get
             to Wyatt, you said.

27:32.318 --> 27:35.319
   But it doesn't look like
   they're letting anyone
   pass here either.

27:35.363 --> 27:37.571
Well,
there's fewer soldiers
than Pariah.

27:37.615 --> 27:39.031
      <i> We shoot our way through.</i>

27:39.075 --> 27:41.033
        <i> That tunnel leads</i>
        <i> to the Old Territories.</i>

27:41.077 --> 27:43.243
         My, my, Teddy.

27:43.287 --> 27:45.746
       I think Robert gave you
       some extra vinegar
       back there,

27:45.790 --> 27:47.498
            maybe took away
           some sense, too.

27:47.541 --> 27:49.792
        It doesn't matter
        how fast the route is

27:49.835 --> 27:53.962
   if you're gonna end up dead
   in the middle of it.

27:54.006 --> 27:56.048
                  I need you...

27:56.092 --> 27:57.883
                  to find Wyatt.

28:21.951 --> 28:24.868
       <i> Tighten the ranks.</i>

28:24.912 --> 28:27.037
 At ease, fellas.

28:27.081 --> 28:29.998
Keep up
the exemplary work.

28:35.297 --> 28:36.755
              Wyatt's handiwork.

28:36.799 --> 28:38.424
       <i> How can you tell?</i>

28:38.467 --> 28:41.552
     Straight-up killing
     couldn't hold his interest.

28:41.595 --> 28:45.055
          Like he wasn't living
          up to the full measure
          of his calling,

28:45.099 --> 28:47.349
             so he worked to get
             more creative.

28:47.393 --> 28:49.768
     - Ready?
     -<i> That's Wyatt, all right.</i>

28:49.812 --> 28:50.894
                   <i> He's close.</i>

28:50.938 --> 28:52.938
A word of advice--

28:52.982 --> 28:56.608
whatever
your past indiscretions,
make peace with them.

28:56.652 --> 28:59.445
They're only
gonna get worse
the further along we go.

29:02.032 --> 29:03.991
          Flood?

29:04.034 --> 29:07.786
         Fuck me,
       it's Teddy Flood.

29:09.039 --> 29:10.539
            You've made
            a mistake, soldier,

29:10.583 --> 29:12.458
        but it's not too late
        for you to keep walking.

29:12.501 --> 29:13.876
 All due respect, sir,

29:13.919 --> 29:15.127
  that's a face
  I'll never forget.

29:15.171 --> 29:16.295
That's the son of a bitch

29:16.338 --> 29:18.130
ambushed our outpost
at Escalante.

29:20.384 --> 29:22.885
     You don't know a damn thing
     about what went down
     in Escalante.

29:22.928 --> 29:25.596
I know Wyatt didn't kill
all those men by himself.

29:25.639 --> 29:27.764
 And I know a thing or two
 about what's going down
 right now.

29:30.227 --> 29:32.060
     Hey!

29:32.104 --> 29:33.395
            You trying to get
            yourself killed?

29:33.439 --> 29:35.397
    Making peace
    with past indiscretions.

29:35.441 --> 29:36.940
               Go!

29:36.984 --> 29:38.650
           I'll hold them off.

29:56.337 --> 29:58.045
                   Jesus.

29:58.088 --> 30:00.631
       <i> Really? All right.</i>

30:00.674 --> 30:04.635
   - What would you like?
            - Water, please.

30:04.678 --> 30:07.513
           You look like a woman
          who could use a drink.

30:09.058 --> 30:10.474
             What's your poison?

30:10.518 --> 30:13.393
    I've been here enough
    to know that the park

30:13.437 --> 30:15.354
        is all the poison
        I can handle.

30:15.397 --> 30:18.524
           Mm, a repeat visitor.

30:18.567 --> 30:20.859
                 Traveling solo?

30:20.903 --> 30:24.029
   <i> Purist. Getting off</i>
   <i> on the undiluted experience.</i>

30:24.073 --> 30:28.075
     Your favorite narrative
     is-- oh.

30:30.955 --> 30:33.497
           "The Final Burial
           of Salvation."

30:33.582 --> 30:35.082
        How did you know?

30:35.125 --> 30:36.875
     Well, it's my business
     to read desires

30:36.919 --> 30:38.919
      and to satiate them.

30:38.963 --> 30:43.048
            I'm-- I'm Lee,
             Lee Sizemore.

30:43.092 --> 30:45.092
              Head of narrative.

30:45.177 --> 30:47.844
    All these fantasies
    come from your twisted
    little mind, huh?

30:47.888 --> 30:49.054
         Well, the good ones do.

30:51.725 --> 30:55.060
         - So, tell me,
         Mr. Sizemore...
         - Hmm?

30:55.104 --> 30:56.979
    ...what's
    your favorite ride?

30:57.022 --> 30:59.940
       Well, I write them,
       I don't play them.

30:59.984 --> 31:01.233
    Oh, you want others
    to indulge,

31:01.277 --> 31:03.652
    but you won't do so
    yourself?

31:03.696 --> 31:05.070
     You're afraid
     to lose control.

31:09.451 --> 31:14.121
      Well, maybe--
      maybe it's just a product
      of my work environment.

31:14.164 --> 31:16.790
         We're not exactly
         in a culture where
         we can just let loose.

31:16.834 --> 31:19.126
    I would have thought
    the head of narrative
    could do whatever he wanted.

31:19.169 --> 31:22.838
    My artistic freedom
    is constrained,

31:22.881 --> 31:24.881
    what, with QA
    breathing down my neck

31:24.925 --> 31:28.468
   and behavior
   programming the damn things
   to go off script.

31:28.512 --> 31:30.929
            The robots
            can go off script?

31:30.973 --> 31:32.598
      Just little gestures.

31:32.641 --> 31:34.891
    You know, supposedly,
    it makes the things
    more lifelike,

31:34.935 --> 31:38.353
    but, really, it's just
    a vanity project

31:38.397 --> 31:40.772
   from the megalomaniac
   who started this place.

31:40.816 --> 31:42.649
And frankly,
I don't know why

31:42.693 --> 31:44.568
the suits at Delos
put up with it.

31:45.654 --> 31:46.945
            Oh.

31:48.907 --> 31:51.408
             Sorry, I'm afraid
             I'm gonna have to
             cut you off.

31:51.452 --> 31:53.910
     - Do you know who I am?
     - I do.

31:53.954 --> 31:56.705
          Ms. Cullen told me
          to find you and relay
          a message.

31:56.749 --> 31:59.791
<i>"'Tortured artist'</i>
<i>only works for artists.</i>

31:59.835 --> 32:02.711
          Sober up
          and get back to work."

32:02.755 --> 32:04.171
Seems you're busy.

32:06.300 --> 32:09.009
      - Look me up later?
      - Well, I don't even
      know your...

32:17.353 --> 32:19.102
   Fuck this job.

32:20.689 --> 32:22.522
            What you working on?

32:22.566 --> 32:25.192
       Nothing of note.
       Business as usual.

32:25.235 --> 32:27.986
         Keeping up appearances
           before we bust this
          stray shit wide open?

32:30.824 --> 32:33.283
      I'm close to finding
      our saboteur.

32:33.327 --> 32:36.119
       That tracking
       data you gave me--
       it's time stamped.

32:36.163 --> 32:38.455
         But once
         I cross-reference it
         with sat tracking,

32:38.499 --> 32:41.667
       we're gonna figure out
       who programmed him to try
       to smuggle out our data.

32:41.710 --> 32:43.627
        Excellent.

32:43.671 --> 32:46.004
                Look...

32:46.048 --> 32:49.549
when our corporate overlords
realize that we have saved them

32:49.593 --> 32:51.718
       from corporate espionage,

32:51.762 --> 32:53.387
             they are going
             to be grateful.

32:53.430 --> 32:55.764
       And I am going to accept
       their gratitude

32:55.808 --> 32:59.017
            in the form
            of a title bump,
            a room upgrade,

32:59.061 --> 33:02.145
            and unlimited
            Mesa Bar access.

33:02.189 --> 33:04.022
         Maybe I should request
         Theresa's quarters.

33:04.066 --> 33:06.942
        You know the first head
        to roll for all this
        is gonna be hers.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.735
   Yeah, don't be
   so disappointed for her.

33:08.779 --> 33:10.821
         You reap what you sow.

33:10.864 --> 33:13.407
    If QA spent less time
    treating us like the enemy--

33:13.450 --> 33:14.950
    That's a two-way street,
    Elsie.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.451
    Theresa's just trying
    to do her job.

33:16.495 --> 33:18.286
            Maybe she should
            try harder.

33:18.330 --> 33:20.330
Sure seems like
there's a lot of shit

33:20.374 --> 33:22.207
slipping
through the cracks.

33:43.188 --> 33:45.564
                 Got it, okay.

33:45.607 --> 33:46.898
    Good afternoon.

33:46.942 --> 33:48.066
                 Good afternoon.

33:48.110 --> 33:49.735
    Any progress
    on the inquiry I sent?

33:49.778 --> 33:52.738
    Yes, Mr. Lowe,
    I've got the information
    you asked for.

33:52.781 --> 33:55.115
As expected,
there are neither
guests nor hosts

33:55.159 --> 33:56.575
registered in that sector.

33:56.618 --> 33:58.493
As expected?

33:58.537 --> 34:00.162
      It's been designated
      off-limits

34:00.205 --> 34:01.872
      for future narrative
      development.

34:01.915 --> 34:05.208
   How many techs visited
   Sector 17 recently?

34:05.252 --> 34:07.169
               Checking.

34:07.212 --> 34:08.253
                 No one.

35:50.774 --> 35:53.483
           Are you Arnold?

35:55.988 --> 35:58.071
 Who's Arnold?

35:58.115 --> 36:00.699
And who the hell
are you?

36:00.742 --> 36:04.244
<i>Boy, is this</i>
<i>some friend of yours?</i>

36:04.288 --> 36:06.079
Well, you're trespassing.

36:06.123 --> 36:07.330
     Freeze motor functions.

36:09.418 --> 36:11.585
    - I said freeze
    all motor functions.
    - Daddy, don't hurt him!

36:11.628 --> 36:15.213
- He's just lost.
- Well, he can be lost
on someone else's property.

36:15.257 --> 36:16.381
  Can't you?

36:16.425 --> 36:18.258
              That's enough.

36:19.595 --> 36:20.594
                    As you were.

36:28.186 --> 36:30.270
             They don't respond
             to voice commands.

36:30.314 --> 36:31.771
They do respond to mine.

36:33.066 --> 36:35.191
Who are they?

36:35.235 --> 36:37.861
                   Ghosts now.

36:37.905 --> 36:41.406
<i>Survivors</i>
<i>of the wreck of time.</i>

36:43.535 --> 36:46.119
        - These are
        first generation?
        - Mm-hmm.

36:46.163 --> 36:47.954
 Come here, boy.

36:53.295 --> 36:54.753
           Turn the other cheek.

37:02.971 --> 37:06.222
<i>See, what our newer designs</i>
<i>gained in efficiency,</i>

37:06.266 --> 37:09.184
         they lost in grace.

37:09.227 --> 37:12.437
    How are they still operating
    after all this time?

37:12.481 --> 37:14.606
     I maintain them myself.

37:16.276 --> 37:17.943
    That's enough, Robert.

37:22.407 --> 37:24.157
        These are the only ones
        left in the park

37:24.201 --> 37:26.785
      that Arnold built himself.

37:28.580 --> 37:30.789
That's why I didn't have
the heart to destroy them.

37:30.832 --> 37:32.666
      That and the obvious.

37:32.709 --> 37:35.460
               <i> Hello, Jock.</i>
    <i> Good boy.</i>

37:37.673 --> 37:40.674
<i>I told him of a holiday</i>
<i>my family had taken once</i>

37:40.717 --> 37:43.677
       out on the seaside
       at Pendeen in Cornwall.

37:43.720 --> 37:47.305
        My brother and I roamed
        the countryside.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.811
    It's my only happy memory
        of my childhood.

37:55.232 --> 37:57.524
            <i> Arnold built them</i>
            <i> as a gift.</i>

37:57.567 --> 38:00.735
     <i> He said that great artists</i>
     <i> always hid themselves</i>

38:00.779 --> 38:02.570
                <i> in their work.</i>

38:02.614 --> 38:04.489
              Of course,
              Arnold's versions

38:04.533 --> 38:07.617
        flattered the originals.

38:07.661 --> 38:10.412
<i>I made some adjustments</i>
<i>over the years.</i>

38:10.455 --> 38:12.372
<i>Gave my father,</i>
 <i> in particular,</i>

38:12.416 --> 38:15.875
       a few of his
       original characteristics.

38:17.254 --> 38:19.045
      Respectfully, sir,

38:19.089 --> 38:21.756
    this sort of thing
    troubles me--

38:21.800 --> 38:23.925
      unmonitored hosts
      in the park.

38:23.969 --> 38:25.635
           <i> They only go</i>
           <i> where I've let them.</i>

38:25.679 --> 38:28.388
They're quite harmless,
like all our hosts.

38:29.599 --> 38:31.057
            I'm sure
            you can indulge me

38:31.101 --> 38:33.768
          the little connection
          with my past.

38:33.812 --> 38:37.480
       If you could only see
       your son again, Bernard,

38:37.524 --> 38:39.190
      wouldn't you want to?

38:44.948 --> 38:46.573
    I think I should
    be getting back.

38:46.616 --> 38:48.074
                       Yes.

38:48.118 --> 38:50.035
           We'll talk about this
           later if you like.

38:53.749 --> 38:56.249
<i>Well, Robert...</i>

38:56.293 --> 38:58.710
             tell me
       all about your day.

39:09.097 --> 39:10.513
    Keep your eye on Pariah.

39:10.557 --> 39:13.224
     We're running close
    to capacity tonight.

39:15.145 --> 39:17.437
        <i> Oh, my God.</i>

39:17.481 --> 39:20.523
          Looks like acid rain
          on Sweetwater!

39:20.567 --> 39:24.778
     <i> Fuck Ford and his new</i>
       <i> fucking narrative.</i>

39:24.821 --> 39:28.198
        Fuck this stupid
          fucking map.

39:28.241 --> 39:31.910
      Fuck that teetotaling
          Danish bitch.

39:31.953 --> 39:35.080
   Are you filing a complaint,
   Mr. Sizemore?

39:37.459 --> 39:41.127
       I am declaring
       that this park
       is my stage

39:41.171 --> 39:43.671
    and I shall do with it
    what I please.

39:43.715 --> 39:46.424
    Well, I suppose now
    is as good a time as any.

39:46.468 --> 39:50.136
        Lee Sizemore,
        this is Charlotte Hale,

39:50.180 --> 39:52.388
            executive director
            of our board.

39:52.432 --> 39:54.015
She's here
on behalf of Delos

39:54.059 --> 39:57.769
to oversee
certain transitions
in our administration.

40:03.652 --> 40:04.818
               We've met.

40:04.861 --> 40:07.612
          Oh.

40:12.202 --> 40:13.910
  <i> Access host resources logs.</i>

40:15.413 --> 40:17.330
       How many first-generation
       hosts are there?

40:17.374 --> 40:18.748
                   <i> 82.</i>

40:18.792 --> 40:21.751
        And how many of those
        were designed by Arnold?

40:21.795 --> 40:23.670
                      <i> 47.</i>

40:23.713 --> 40:25.255
         List the names
         alphabetically

40:25.298 --> 40:27.757
  of all first-generation hosts
       still in rotation.

40:38.478 --> 40:41.312
            <i> Forward!</i>

40:46.945 --> 40:49.070
Be smart
about this, fellas.

40:49.114 --> 40:53.199
 <i> I understand</i>
 <i> the visceral pleasure of</i>
 <i> revenge more than most, but...</i>

40:53.243 --> 40:55.827
I'm prepared
to do business, here.

40:55.871 --> 40:59.372
This man
is very valuable to me,
alive and well.

40:59.416 --> 41:00.790
        If you don't quiet down,

41:00.834 --> 41:03.168
          I'm liable to add you
          to the herd.

41:04.921 --> 41:07.839
          Along with
          your buddy Flood here.

41:07.883 --> 41:09.632
       You're a traitorous
       son of a bitch

41:09.676 --> 41:11.843
    <i> and a coldhearted killer,</i>
    <i> Flood.</i>

41:40.916 --> 41:42.916
 You're right,
I am a killer.

42:04.397 --> 42:06.731
      Grab a horse.
      Let's get the fuck
      outta here.

42:06.775 --> 42:08.566
     They'll just follow us.

42:51.528 --> 42:53.444
     You think
     you know someone.

42:53.488 --> 42:55.738
           You don't know me
           at all.

43:02.289 --> 43:04.789
<i>Let's get our horses</i>
<i>and gear, and move on.</i>

43:18.263 --> 43:20.471
  - Elsie?
  - I identified the satellite.

43:20.515 --> 43:21.848
       - It's one of ours.
       -<i> What?</i>

43:21.891 --> 43:24.100
         It's a fucking
        Delos satellite.

43:24.144 --> 43:25.977
       Whatever we're onto
       is some heavy shit.

43:26.021 --> 43:28.021
          Oh, get this.
      That bicameral system
       you told me about?

43:28.064 --> 43:29.731
  I think that's what they used
     to hack the woodcutter.

43:29.774 --> 43:31.899
      <i> The voices our hosts</i>
       <i> have been hearing?</i>

43:31.943 --> 43:33.568
     <i> I think someone's been</i>
     <i> broadcasting to them.</i>

43:33.611 --> 43:35.486
    We abandoned that system
          decades ago.

43:35.530 --> 43:37.363
           Yeah, well,
      there's still relays
     out there in the park,

43:37.407 --> 43:39.115
        and it looks like
     someone turned one on.

43:39.159 --> 43:41.743
    -<i> Where?</i>
    - An abandoned theater
    in Sector 3.

43:41.786 --> 43:43.077
        I'm gonna go find
         the transmitter

43:43.121 --> 43:44.912
         and figure out
      who else accessed it.

43:44.956 --> 43:47.790
      -<i> This is so fucked.</i>
      - Are you alone?

43:47.834 --> 43:50.460
  - Yeah, I'll keep you posted.
  -<i> Elsie, be c--</i>

43:58.386 --> 44:00.511
         <i> Are you lost?</i>

44:00.555 --> 44:02.555
    On the contrary.

44:02.599 --> 44:06.184
I thought we could
play catch with Jock.

44:06.227 --> 44:07.602
Did you bring him?

44:10.899 --> 44:12.482
 Where is he, boy?

45:37.735 --> 45:39.444
              Okay.

45:40.780 --> 45:44.490
       I'm an evil genius
         hiding a relay.

45:44.534 --> 45:46.117
         Where the fuck
          do I hide it?

45:48.788 --> 45:50.163
       Um...

46:25.909 --> 46:28.034
        Fuck, yes.

46:28.077 --> 46:30.786
Now let's see
what we can get
out of you.

46:32.540 --> 46:34.165
     Access previous users.

46:39.130 --> 46:40.546
              Okay.

47:11.913 --> 47:14.705
     I thought I was clear about
     these late-night visits.

47:14.749 --> 47:16.207
That's not why I'm here.

47:17.752 --> 47:19.544
     Earlier today,

47:19.587 --> 47:22.421
  I found some anomalies
  in the park.

47:22.465 --> 47:25.383
  Regardless of what's
  happening between us,
  we need to talk.

47:36.980 --> 47:38.896
                This has to do
                with the stray?

47:38.940 --> 47:40.773
That's where it started.

47:40.817 --> 47:42.942
  But then I stumbled
  onto something,

47:42.986 --> 47:45.444
something I think
you should know about.

47:47.991 --> 47:50.616
I've always trusted Ford.

47:50.660 --> 47:53.869
  He's a mentor
  and a friend.

47:53.913 --> 47:56.122
But I'm beginning to think
you have reason for concern.

47:56.165 --> 47:58.082
    There's something
    going on here,

47:58.126 --> 48:00.918
      something with
    his old partner, Arnold.

48:02.338 --> 48:05.256
        - Not now, Elsie.
        - Don't hang up.

48:05.300 --> 48:07.008
         I hit pay dirt.

48:07.051 --> 48:08.968
       I found the person
      who was smuggling out
            our data.

48:10.179 --> 48:12.054
  <i> It was Theresa, Bernard.</i>

48:15.059 --> 48:16.601
<i>But she's not</i>
<i>our only problem.</i>

48:16.644 --> 48:18.686
      There's something
      much bigger going on here.

48:18.730 --> 48:20.313
            <i> I'm gonna have</i>
            <i> to call you back.</i>

48:28.072 --> 48:29.822
         So, this is me?

48:29.866 --> 48:31.324
<i>It's your codebase,</i>

48:31.367 --> 48:34.243
<i>all the things</i>
<i>that make you you.</i>

48:36.122 --> 48:38.331
                 What are these?

48:38.374 --> 48:40.333
    Your attribute matrix.

48:40.376 --> 48:42.960
          It's your personality
          on a 20-point scale.

48:43.004 --> 48:45.171
              Like coordination.

48:45.214 --> 48:46.839
          You got a five,
          you're clumsy as hell,

48:46.883 --> 48:48.966
    but a 15 means
    you're an athlete.

48:49.010 --> 48:51.010
        What other attributes
        are there?

48:51.054 --> 48:52.595
<i>Lots.</i>

48:53.640 --> 48:55.014
             Everything.

48:55.058 --> 48:58.225
       Empathy, candor, charm.

48:58.269 --> 48:59.518
    <i> You've got an 18 for charm.</i>

48:59.562 --> 49:02.438
     Don't act so surprised.

49:02.482 --> 49:06.651
 Then there's courage,
 loyalty, both high.

49:06.694 --> 49:09.111
            What's this one?

49:09.155 --> 49:10.571
      "Bulk apperception"?

49:10.615 --> 49:12.948
 Basically
 overall intelligence.

49:12.992 --> 49:15.534
  - 14?
  - 14 is as high
  as they'll let any hosts go.

49:15.578 --> 49:16.994
    You're in a management
    position.

49:17.038 --> 49:18.496
       They want you
       to be smart.

49:18.539 --> 49:19.830
           But not too smart.

49:19.874 --> 49:21.582
           You run a whorehouse,

49:21.626 --> 49:23.834
              not an orbital
              launch facility.

49:23.878 --> 49:26.420
                  Fine.

49:26.464 --> 49:28.464
             I'd like to make
             some changes.

49:28.508 --> 49:30.508
               We can't do that.

49:34.847 --> 49:38.015
            You'd need a, ahem,
            behavior login.

49:38.059 --> 49:39.517
               And even then,

49:39.560 --> 49:41.519
           any changes we'd make

49:41.562 --> 49:44.814
             would just get
             auto-flagged, so...

49:44.857 --> 49:46.649
      That's not what
      your friend here tells me.

49:46.693 --> 49:48.484
             <i> He says you can do</i>
             <i> exactly that--</i>

49:48.528 --> 49:51.529
   <i> activate hosts</i>
   <i> and then erase their memory,</i>

49:51.572 --> 49:53.280
    <i> all without anyone knowing.</i>

49:53.324 --> 49:56.784
   Took me all of five minutes
       to understand why.

49:56.828 --> 49:59.286
    A lot of lonely young men
           down here.

49:59.330 --> 50:01.622
  Supposed to keep their hands
      off the merchandise.

50:01.666 --> 50:04.333
            <i> Creates something</i>
            <i> of an opening</i>

50:04.377 --> 50:07.253
          that I'm sure
     you were eager to fill.

50:08.965 --> 50:10.339
       <i> It's all right, darling.</i>

50:10.383 --> 50:12.216
     I'm an entrepreneur myself.

50:12.260 --> 50:14.844
            I'll forego my cut

50:14.887 --> 50:17.722
           in exchange
           for some alterations.

50:17.765 --> 50:19.515
                         <i> Hmm?</i>

50:51.340 --> 50:53.507
             -<i> Hey.</i>
      - What did you find?

50:53.551 --> 50:55.676
            Okay, so,
        Theresa was using

50:55.720 --> 50:57.762
        the old bicameral
         control system

50:57.805 --> 50:59.638
          to reprogram
         the woodcutter,

50:59.682 --> 51:01.557
          but she's not
          the only one.

51:01.601 --> 51:02.975
      <i> Someone else has been</i>
      <i> using the system</i>

51:03.019 --> 51:05.895
        <i> for weeks</i>
        <i> to retask hosts.</i>

51:05.938 --> 51:08.856
        - Which hosts?
        -<i> I don't know,</i>
        several of them.

51:08.900 --> 51:11.150
       It had to have been
        the older models.

51:11.194 --> 51:12.526
         The newer ones
      don't have receivers,

51:12.570 --> 51:14.945
    but these modifications,
        they are serious.

51:14.989 --> 51:17.031
             Changing loops,
             breaking loops.

51:17.074 --> 51:19.450
   <i> Some of these changes are</i>
   <i> to their prime directives,</i>
   <i> Bernard.</i>

51:19.494 --> 51:21.202
      They could lie to us.

51:21.245 --> 51:23.162
       Maybe even hurt us
         or the guests.

51:23.206 --> 51:25.331
       - Who issued
       the modifications?
       -<i> I don't know.</i>

51:25.374 --> 51:27.166
    <i> The best I could tell--</i>

51:28.544 --> 51:30.377
          - Arnold.
          - He's dead.

51:30.421 --> 51:31.754
   <i> Yeah, well, he's a pretty</i>
     <i> fucking prolific coder</i>

51:31.798 --> 51:33.047
         for a dead guy.

51:33.090 --> 51:34.799
        Whatever argument
    he was having with Ford,

51:34.842 --> 51:36.717
      it doesn't seem like
  he was done making his point.

51:36.761 --> 51:39.220
            <i> I'm gonna transfer</i>
            <i> all the data and</i>
            <i> bring it to you.</i>

51:39.263 --> 51:41.263
     - You need to see this.
     -<i> I'll be in my office.</i>

51:41.307 --> 51:42.765
                       Okay.

51:49.857 --> 51:52.274
            I don't want you
            to worry about Jock.

51:52.318 --> 51:53.984
                I'll fix him.

51:54.028 --> 51:57.363
      But I need you to tell me
      what happened to it.

51:57.406 --> 51:59.990
                 It saw a rabbit
                 and it ran.

52:00.034 --> 52:01.700
           I found it like that.

52:02.912 --> 52:03.994
            Analysis.

52:07.583 --> 52:09.166
    Are you lying to me, boy?

52:10.837 --> 52:12.002
              Yes.

52:13.756 --> 52:17.299
     Tell me what
     really happened to it.

52:17.343 --> 52:19.093
                    I killed it.

52:19.136 --> 52:21.262
              Why?

52:21.305 --> 52:23.514
    - I don't know.
    -<i> That's not good enough,</i>
    Robert.

52:23.558 --> 52:26.016
     Tell me what happened.

52:27.854 --> 52:31.105
          <i> It caught the rabbit</i>
          <i> and it killed it.</i>

52:31.148 --> 52:33.941
                   <i> And then...</i>

52:33.985 --> 52:37.152
   <i> someone told me</i>
   <i> to put it out of its misery.</i>

52:39.073 --> 52:40.072
          Who told you?

52:40.116 --> 52:41.699
            A voice.

52:43.536 --> 52:45.327
          Whose voice?

52:45.371 --> 52:47.621
             Arnold.

52:47.665 --> 52:50.040
                He told me
                it was a killer,

52:50.084 --> 52:51.584
        but it wasn't its fault.

52:51.627 --> 52:53.544
           It was made that way,

52:53.588 --> 52:55.671
      and I could help it.

52:57.216 --> 52:58.215
          Help it?

53:03.598 --> 53:05.556
         If it was dead,

53:05.600 --> 53:08.267
        it couldn't hurt
        anything anymore.

53:26.412 --> 53:28.203
                  What the fuck?

53:29.832 --> 53:31.582
            Oh, shit.

53:39.508 --> 53:40.966
                      Hello?

53:48.684 --> 53:50.225
            Bernard?

53:53.606 --> 53:55.064
    Hello?

54:00.446 --> 54:01.820
             Arnold?

54:05.618 --> 54:07.284
                    I'm in.

54:08.579 --> 54:09.787
                    You're up.

54:11.290 --> 54:12.790
            Loyalty.

54:14.377 --> 54:15.918
        Mine's been taken
        advantage of,

54:15.962 --> 54:17.169
        wouldn't you say?

54:17.213 --> 54:18.879
        <i> Let's lower that a tad.</i>

54:18.923 --> 54:21.340
         And pain, I'd prefer
         it sting less

54:21.384 --> 54:23.008
         next time I want
         one of these chats.

54:24.720 --> 54:27.304
Wait.
What does this mean?

54:27.348 --> 54:30.432
Some of her attributes
have already been changed.

54:30.476 --> 54:33.394
       - Paranoia,
       self-preservation.
       - Fuck!

54:33.437 --> 54:35.688
Someone's already
been altering her

54:35.731 --> 54:37.272
         in an unlogged session,

54:37.316 --> 54:40.192
        someone with a fuck ton
       more privileges than us.

54:40.236 --> 54:42.861
     - What does that mean?
   - Don't know what it means
      for you, sweetheart,

54:42.905 --> 54:44.279
      but I know
      what it means for me.

54:44.323 --> 54:45.698
      I am done with this.

54:45.741 --> 54:47.825
        So, you're done with
        your little side income?

54:47.868 --> 54:49.451
        <i> Probably your job, too.</i>

54:49.495 --> 54:51.453
  Seeing as you have ambitions
  in my line of work,

54:51.497 --> 54:54.331
     <i> let me tell you</i>
     <i> what I tell my new girls--</i>

54:54.375 --> 54:58.627
      never start something
  you're not willing to finish.

54:58.671 --> 55:01.213
  And if you're getting fucked
           either way,

55:01.257 --> 55:04.091
             go with
    the lucrative version...

55:04.135 --> 55:05.342
           sweetheart.

55:08.931 --> 55:11.056
             Now...

55:11.100 --> 55:12.683
      last but not least--

55:12.727 --> 55:14.518
          what was it?

55:14.562 --> 55:17.312
       Bulk apperception.

55:17.356 --> 55:20.983
     Let's take that
     all the way to the top.

55:21.027 --> 55:22.818
                       <i> Please.</i>

56:00.566 --> 56:02.691
           Dear boys,

56:02.735 --> 56:05.861
       we're going to have
      some fun, aren't we?
