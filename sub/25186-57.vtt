00:17.960 --> 00:22.959
Hello and welcome to
Love Island: The Reunion.

00:22.960 --> 00:26.959
It was all about love,
loyalty and doing bits,

00:26.960 --> 00:29.959
but there are still lots
of bits need doing.

00:29.960 --> 00:32.959
We are getting hot under the collar

00:32.960 --> 00:35.960
with each and every one of our
islanders.

00:36.960 --> 00:39.000
And here they are.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.959
They look different with clothes on.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.960
And here we have the twins.

00:50.320 --> 00:53.959
After a record-breaking finale with
over 2.5 million votes,

00:53.960 --> 00:59.960
you crowned Jack and Dani your
winners of Love Island 2018.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.959
There they are. How good was it to
hear those words?

01:05.960 --> 01:11.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Amazing.</font> Still not real.

01:11.960 --> 01:16.159
Bless you. But it's not just about
our winners.

01:16.160 --> 01:19.959
38 islanders entered the villa this
year.

01:19.960 --> 01:25.959
Every single one of them is here
tonight.

01:25.960 --> 01:31.959
The first boy into the villa, Niall
is here.

01:31.960 --> 01:35.960
The always real Georgia and Sam.

01:36.960 --> 01:41.960
And who could forget Idris and
Kieran?

01:43.960 --> 01:46.639
We are not counting

01:46.640 --> 01:51.999
but it's been 8,659 minutes since
the islanders vacated the villa.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.959
So we rolled out the red carpet
and brought them back in style.

01:57.960 --> 02:00.959
Here is what happened when they left
sunny Majorca

02:00.960 --> 02:03.000
and headed back to sunnier Britain.

02:04.960 --> 02:08.960
It's time to find out who you have
chosen as your winning couple...

02:12.960 --> 02:14.960
..Dani and Jack!

<font color="#00FFFF">We just won. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, my God.</font>

02:31.960 --> 02:36.960
<font color="#FFFF00">That was one of the best things</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I have ever had in my life.</font>

02:38.960 --> 02:42.959
<font color="#FFFF00">The best day of my life so far.</font>

02:42.960 --> 02:44.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm happy I'm with you.</font>

02:48.480 --> 02:52.999
<font color="#00FFFF">I have met a girl that I love.</font>

02:53.000 --> 02:59.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm going to polish it.</font>

03:02.800 --> 03:07.959
<font color="#FFFF00">It's not just friends that we have</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">made.</font>

03:07.960 --> 03:12.479
<font color="#FFFF00">I can't explain. All my emotions</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">are all over.</font>

03:12.480 --> 03:15.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Jack and Dani. I was screaming.</font>

03:15.960 --> 03:18.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I have lost my voice a little bit.</font>

03:21.960 --> 03:25.160
<font color="#FFFF00">We have won Love Island.</font>

03:40.960 --> 03:43.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, my God.</font>

03:43.960 --> 03:48.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Laura,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you're at the wrong airport, love.</font>

03:48.960 --> 03:51.959
<font color="#11FF11">I know.</font>

03:51.960 --> 03:54.960
<font color="#00FFFF">You're in Stansted.</font>

03:58.160 --> 04:03.640
<font color="#11FF11"># I'm coming home #</font>

04:26.960 --> 04:30.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Wes is wild.</font>

04:34.960 --> 04:39.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Is that Wes's dad in the T-shirt?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes, it is.</font>

04:39.960 --> 04:42.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I am not prepared for this.</font>

04:42.960 --> 04:46.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I haven't got any make-up on.</font>

04:53.800 --> 04:56.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Unbelievable.</font>

04:56.960 --> 04:58.960
(CHEERING)

05:00.960 --> 05:03.639
Crazy. The islanders are so famous

05:03.640 --> 05:08.959
that they can't walk down the street
without being recognised.

05:08.960 --> 05:12.160
Here is the voice: Iain Stirling.

05:22.160 --> 05:25.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Hi, guys.</font>

05:25.960 --> 05:30.959
So nice to see your face. <font color="#FFFF00">Isn't it?</font>

05:30.960 --> 05:35.959
This is when everybody realises how
good-looking you are.

05:35.960 --> 05:39.479
How are you?

05:39.480 --> 05:43.639
<font color="#FFFF00">Good. Tanned, tired, but good.</font>

05:43.640 --> 05:47.959
You spent eight weeks in the villa.
Is it like being on a long holiday?

05:47.960 --> 05:50.959
<font color="#FFFF00">No.</font>

05:50.960 --> 05:56.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I come out again and watch all</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">these people.</font>

05:56.960 --> 06:00.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I see them doing naughty things.</font>

06:00.960 --> 06:02.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Some more than others.</font>

06:02.960 --> 06:05.959
Have you enjoyed talking about this
lot?

06:05.960 --> 06:07.959
<font color="#FFFF00">They were great this year.</font>

06:07.960 --> 06:13.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Normally about by week five,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">everybody is coupled up.</font>

06:13.960 --> 06:17.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Everybody was going everywhere.</font>

06:17.960 --> 06:21.159
Let's talk about your favourite
moments from the series.

06:21.160 --> 06:26.959
What has that been?

06:26.960 --> 06:33.959
<font color="#FFFF00">There was one moment when</font>

06:33.960 --> 06:36.959
<font color="#FFFF00">a joke entered Jack's head</font>

06:36.960 --> 06:38.959
<font color="#FFFF00">and he couldn't help himself.</font>

06:38.960 --> 06:44.960
<font color="#FFFF00">And he slammed verbally.</font>

07:12.640 --> 07:14.640
(CHEERING)

07:16.960 --> 07:21.959
<font color="#FFFF00">In his head, he was doing laps of</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the bedroom.</font>

07:21.960 --> 07:28.639
Did you think she was going to go?

07:28.640 --> 07:34.959
<font color="#FFFF00">No. You wouldn't leave me, would</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> No.</font>

07:34.960 --> 07:36.959
What was your second-favourite
moment?

07:36.960 --> 07:41.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Dr Alex.</font>

07:43.960 --> 07:51.319
<font color="#FFFF00">The moment I fell in love with you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">is when you talk about sex</font>

07:51.320 --> 07:58.959
<font color="#FFFF00">in the most socially awkward way.</font>

07:58.960 --> 08:05.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Boys, what is your girls' favourite</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">sex position?</font>

08:05.960 --> 08:08.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Eyal, can you show me your answer?</font>

08:08.960 --> 08:10.999
<font color="#00FFFF">Megan?</font>

08:11.000 --> 08:13.959
<font color="#FFFF00">My parents are going to watch this.</font>

08:13.960 --> 08:18.959
<font color="#11FF11">Doggy fashion.</font>

08:18.960 --> 08:24.960
<font color="#11FF11">It's nicer than doggy style.</font>

08:26.960 --> 08:30.319
I thought that was a really nice way
to say it.

08:30.320 --> 08:35.958
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm going to have some Singapore</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">fashion noodles tomorrow.</font>

08:35.960 --> 08:38.958
<font color="#FFFF00">Have you done any doggy fashion?</font>

08:38.960 --> 08:44.999
<font color="#11FF11">None at all. Not in my life. Ever.</font>

08:45.000 --> 08:51.959
<font color="#FFFF00">He is hilarious. Not in my life.</font>

08:51.960 --> 08:57.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I look at doggy fashion.</font>

08:57.960 --> 09:03.319
<font color="#FFFF00">I cover myself in the Guardian.</font>

09:03.320 --> 09:06.959
<font color="#FFFF00">People say we are lowbrow on Love</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Island.</font>

09:06.960 --> 09:09.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Not the case.</font>

09:09.960 --> 09:13.959
<font color="#FFFF00">People say that Brexit is</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">misinformation</font>

09:13.960 --> 09:16.479
<font color="#FFFF00">and Hayley took on the role.</font>

09:16.480 --> 09:22.959
<font color="#FFFF00">She took the character on</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and satirised the public.</font>

09:22.960 --> 09:28.479
<font color="#FFFF00">She showed everybody what's wrong</font>

09:28.480 --> 09:34.959
<font color="#FFFF00">and she is the epitome of the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">British public.</font>

09:34.960 --> 09:39.959
<font color="#00FFFF">What do you think about Brexit?</font>

09:39.960 --> 09:44.959
<font color="#00FFFF">We are leaving the European Union.</font>

09:44.960 --> 09:54.959
<font color="#11FF11">It would mean welfare and things we</font>
<font color="#11FF11">trade with would get cut down.</font>

09:54.960 --> 09:58.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Does that mean we would not have</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">any cheese?</font>

09:58.960 --> 10:05.319
<font color="#00FFFF">Would it mean it would be harder</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to go on holiday</font>

10:05.320 --> 10:10.960
<font color="#00FFFF">because I love my holidays?</font>

10:13.320 --> 10:16.959
Have you had a chance to learn about
it yet?

10:16.960 --> 10:20.319
<font color="#FFFF00">I've got one of these.</font>

10:20.320 --> 10:23.959
Hayley, everybody.

10:23.960 --> 10:26.479
Ian, congratulations.

10:26.480 --> 10:29.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Congratulations to Caroline Flack</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">for being absolutely brilliant.</font>

10:29.960 --> 10:34.640
(CHEERING)

10:35.960 --> 10:41.959
Later in the show we will be
welcoming back the Muggys.

10:41.960 --> 10:48.959
And the people's choice will be
decided entirely by you at home.

10:48.960 --> 10:55.959
I will be talking to Wes and Megan.

10:55.960 --> 10:58.000
See you in a moment.

11:02.960 --> 11:08.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm nervous to see who is there.</font>

11:08.960 --> 11:10.320
<font color="#FFFF00">I want to see who is there.</font>

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

11:18.320 --> 11:20.320
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

11:24.800 --> 11:27.959
Welcome back to Love Island: The
Reunion.

11:27.960 --> 11:33.959
It's the very best of Love Island
2018 and I am here with Eyal.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.959
How are you doing?
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm great, thanks, hon.</font>

11:35.960 --> 11:39.959
I am not your hon.

11:39.960 --> 11:45.959
Who's ready to meet our couple?

11:45.960 --> 11:50.960
Here is what happened when they got
back from the UK.

11:54.960 --> 11:58.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm excited now.</font>

11:58.960 --> 12:01.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm meeting</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">your family and friends.</font>

12:01.960 --> 12:08.800
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm nervous to see you who is going</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to be there.</font>

12:10.160 --> 12:15.959
<font color="#11FF11">I didn't expect him to come out</font>
<font color="#11FF11">with a girlfriend.</font>

12:15.960 --> 12:19.960
<font color="#11FF11">Obviously, he has come out with</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Megan and I can't wait to see him.</font>

12:23.960 --> 12:28.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I am scared. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Are you nervous?</font>

12:28.960 --> 12:30.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Let's go for it.</font>

12:34.960 --> 12:36.960
(CHEERING)

12:48.960 --> 12:51.959
<font color="#00FFFF">They are all so lovely, all so</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">welcoming.</font>

12:51.960 --> 12:55.639
<font color="#00FFFF">It's really nice to see the real</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Wes outside of the villa.</font>

12:55.640 --> 13:01.959
<font color="#11FF11">Did I miss you?</font>

13:01.960 --> 13:04.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Really happy for him.</font>

13:04.960 --> 13:09.799
<font color="#FFFF00">Getting quite emotional.</font>

13:09.800 --> 13:11.959
<font color="#FFFF00">What about moving to Southend?</font>

13:11.960 --> 13:19.959
<font color="#00FFFF">It has been such a lovely day</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">meeting his family and friends.</font>

13:19.960 --> 13:22.639
<font color="#00FFFF">I can't wait to take him to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Southend</font>

13:22.640 --> 13:24.959
<font color="#00FFFF">and show him where I had been</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">brought up.</font>

13:24.960 --> 13:28.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Take him to the beach, he will love</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">it. What more could you want?</font>

13:30.960 --> 13:34.959
<font color="#00FFFF">What did</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the zero say to the eight?</font>

13:34.960 --> 13:38.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't know. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Nice belt.</font>

13:41.960 --> 13:44.959
<font color="#FFFF00">It is Adventure Island? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Yes.</font>

13:44.960 --> 13:46.960
<font color="#FFFF00">What a place.</font>

13:49.960 --> 13:51.960
<font color="#00FFFF">(SCREAMS)</font>

14:03.000 --> 14:11.959
<font color="#FFFF00">It's so fun. Fun being with her.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't want it to end now.</font>

14:11.960 --> 14:19.319
<font color="#FFFF00">Southend is amazing. It's going to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">be my home.</font>

14:19.320 --> 14:23.960
<font color="#FFFF00">It's happening.</font>

14:27.480 --> 14:29.480
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

14:31.960 --> 14:34.160
Don't have a meltdown.

14:46.960 --> 14:48.959
Hello. <font color="#FFFF00">Hi.</font>

14:48.960 --> 14:54.639
You both look gorgeous tonight. What
has life been like since the villa?

14:54.640 --> 14:57.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Great to come back to this</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">positivity.</font>

14:57.960 --> 15:02.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Overwhelming at the airport when I</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">saw all the stuff there.</font>

15:02.960 --> 15:05.959
Like with the Beatles.

15:05.960 --> 15:12.159
<font color="#00FFFF">So many crowds. People were crying.</font>

15:12.160 --> 15:15.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I was shaking.</font>

15:15.960 --> 15:18.159
What was the best thing about being
out the villa,

15:18.160 --> 15:22.959
apart from afternoon naps?

15:22.960 --> 15:24.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Definitely seeing my family.</font>

15:24.960 --> 15:31.479
<font color="#FFFF00">When you are in there, there are</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">good times and some hard times.</font>

15:31.480 --> 15:33.959
What did you make of Southend?

15:33.960 --> 15:38.479
<font color="#FFFF00">It's very nice. Why does everybody</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">say it's bad?</font>

15:38.480 --> 15:41.999
What are you going to do about your
job?

15:42.000 --> 15:46.319
<font color="#FFFF00">About that...</font>

15:46.320 --> 15:49.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I think I'll just see what</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">opportunities there are.</font>

15:49.960 --> 15:54.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I have spoken to work and they</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">understand I might not be saying.</font>

15:54.960 --> 15:57.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I need to see him in a suit.</font>

15:57.960 --> 16:01.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I am wearing one now.</font>

16:01.960 --> 16:07.959
You were with Laura for over three
weeks.

16:07.960 --> 16:11.959
If Megan hadn't come in, do you
think you'd have been with Laura?

16:11.960 --> 16:13.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes, I think so.</font>

16:13.960 --> 16:21.959
<font color="#FFFF00">There was something missing.</font>

16:21.960 --> 16:24.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I think that if there is something</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">missing,</font>

16:24.960 --> 16:28.959
<font color="#FFFF00">it's important for you to be able</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to look at what else is there.</font>

16:28.960 --> 16:33.959
<font color="#FFFF00">It has worked out for the best for</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">both of us.</font>

16:33.960 --> 16:36.959
<font color="#FFFF00">She is happy, I am happy.</font>

16:36.960 --> 16:39.959
Megan, you entered the villa and you
were with Eyal.

16:39.960 --> 16:45.319
You even did some bits together. Did
you always have one eye on Wes?

16:45.320 --> 16:53.960
<font color="#00FFFF">When I went in, I had three boys to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">date, Niall, Eyal...</font>

16:55.960 --> 17:03.959
<font color="#00FFFF">It's terrible, but yes.</font>

17:03.960 --> 17:07.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I knew that I definitely fancied</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">them,</font>

17:07.960 --> 17:12.959
<font color="#00FFFF">but after that I was gravitating</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">towards Wes.</font>

17:12.960 --> 17:17.638
<font color="#00FFFF">When you are comfortable around</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">someone and can be silly together.</font>

17:17.640 --> 17:24.799
<font color="#00FFFF">The first couple of days, I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">didn't even look you in the eye.</font>

17:24.800 --> 17:30.319
<font color="#00FFFF">It just evolved and when you are</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">in that situation,</font>

17:30.320 --> 17:33.959
<font color="#00FFFF">you can't hide it.</font>

17:33.960 --> 17:36.799
<font color="#00FFFF">If you like somebody, you</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">gravitate towards them.</font>

17:36.800 --> 17:37.959
<font color="#00FFFF">It's going to happen.</font>

17:37.960 --> 17:43.319
You have been really honest about
the fact that you have never had any
real girlfriends. Why?

17:43.320 --> 17:48.959
<font color="#00FFFF">In my job I was a dancer and I was</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">really naive to it.</font>

17:48.960 --> 17:54.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I had done it so close to home,</font>

17:54.960 --> 17:58.959
<font color="#00FFFF">everybody had something negative to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">say.</font>

17:58.960 --> 18:02.959
<font color="#00FFFF">The easiest thing to do was</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">distance myself from all the girls</font>

18:02.960 --> 18:08.319
<font color="#00FFFF">and the negative comments. I hung</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">around with boys.</font>

18:08.320 --> 18:13.959
<font color="#00FFFF">There is no politics with she said</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">this and that.</font>

18:13.960 --> 18:18.159
There is stuff in the press about
you not liking Georgia.

18:18.160 --> 18:23.639
Can you clear that up for us?

18:23.640 --> 18:27.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Why is that? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I didn't get it.</font>

18:27.960 --> 18:32.639
<font color="#00FFFF">I am very introverted and shy and</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Georgia is extroverted.</font>

18:32.640 --> 18:39.479
<font color="#00FFFF">Everything is massive, so I don't</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">think it's that I didn't like it,</font>

18:39.480 --> 18:41.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I didn't get it being around that</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">type of person.</font>

18:41.960 --> 18:43.959
Georgia?

18:43.960 --> 18:46.959
<font color="#FFFF00">That's OK. No need to worry,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">darling.</font>

18:46.960 --> 18:49.959
You two are so different.

18:49.960 --> 18:57.959
Thankfully for us, we had the DBS to
keep us on track.

18:57.960 --> 19:03.959
Take a look at this.

19:03.960 --> 19:07.960
<font color="#00FFFF">It counts. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, my God.</font>

19:09.960 --> 19:13.999
<font color="#FFFF00">To join the society,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">one must have done bits.</font>

19:14.000 --> 19:18.479
<font color="#00FFFF">Can't you be the manager?</font>

19:18.480 --> 19:22.959
<font color="#11FF11">No.</font>

19:22.960 --> 19:26.959
<font color="#FFFF00">We are calling a DBS meeting.</font>

19:26.960 --> 19:31.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Did you have sex?</font>

19:31.960 --> 19:39.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Yes.</font>

19:41.960 --> 19:43.959
(CHEERING)

19:43.960 --> 19:46.959
I don't think there were two people
in the villa

19:46.960 --> 19:48.959
who did more bits than you.

19:48.960 --> 19:50.959
As King and Queen of that society,

19:50.960 --> 19:53.960
it's only right that we got you
these.

19:56.960 --> 20:00.959
She had to kiss a few frogs before
she found her prince.

20:00.960 --> 20:07.959
No offence, guys. She eventually
bagged her Mr Right.

20:07.960 --> 20:11.959
Wes and Megan...

20:11.960 --> 20:15.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I want more dance moves and</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">positive, good vibes.</font>

20:15.960 --> 20:17.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I want a party.</font>

20:18.960 --> 20:22.960
<font color="#FFFF00">You are daft.</font>

20:28.960 --> 20:31.000
<font color="#FFFF00">What a time</font> <font color="#FFFF00">to be alive.</font>

20:32.960 --> 20:35.319
<font color="#00FFFF">Hi, guys.</font>

20:35.320 --> 20:44.960
<font color="#11FF11">I want to be</font> <font color="#11FF11">an animal.</font>

20:46.960 --> 20:48.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I would be lying</font> <font color="#FFFF00">if I said</font>

20:48.960 --> 20:51.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I did not find</font> <font color="#FFFF00">him attractive.</font>

20:51.960 --> 20:53.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Did you kiss?</font>

20:53.960 --> 20:55.799
<font color="#11FF11">Are you going</font>
<font color="#11FF11">to crack on with Megan?</font>

20:55.800 --> 21:01.959
<font color="#00FFFF">She is going to hate me.</font>

21:01.960 --> 21:05.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I am putting all</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">my eggs in one basket.</font>

21:05.960 --> 21:09.959
<font color="#FFFF00">The other person</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I can see a future with is you.</font>

21:09.960 --> 21:13.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I get on with Alex</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">but I do still fancy you.</font>

21:16.960 --> 21:19.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I definitely</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">will not be jumping ship again.</font>

21:23.960 --> 21:25.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Do you want to be my boyfriend?</font>

21:27.960 --> 21:29.959
<font color="#11FF11">You have done us proud.</font>

21:29.960 --> 21:34.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Do you like Megan? </font><font color="#11FF11"> 100 percent.</font>

21:34.960 --> 21:39.960
<font color="#11FF11">We are really happy that she is</font>
<font color="#11FF11">happy with Wes.</font>

21:47.960 --> 21:49.959
(CHEERING)

21:49.960 --> 21:53.959
By the way, I loved your Instagram
post this morning, Megan.

21:53.960 --> 21:57.960
I thought it was really strong. Wes
and Megan, everybody.

21:58.960 --> 22:04.959
Still to come, we will be catching
up with our third-placed couple.

22:04.960 --> 22:08.959
They found a baby-sitter.

22:08.960 --> 22:12.959
How is he? <font color="#FFFF00">He's doing all right.</font>

22:12.960 --> 22:15.959
See you in a mo.

22:15.960 --> 22:23.959
<font color="#11FF11">She always wears make-up.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">For a nice day.</font>

22:23.960 --> 22:26.799
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah, Josh. Let's talk about that.</font>

22:26.800 --> 22:28.800
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

22:32.960 --> 22:34.960
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

22:39.960 --> 22:42.959
Welcome back to Love Island: The
Reunion.

22:42.960 --> 22:47.959
I have delved into the audience to
have a catch-up with our islanders.

22:47.960 --> 22:50.159
Samira and Frankie.

22:50.160 --> 22:53.959
How are you?

22:53.960 --> 22:55.959
Fine.

22:55.960 --> 22:57.999
Rumour has it you have been a
naughty boy.

22:58.000 --> 23:06.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes, there is stuff in the papers</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">but it is only a small part.</font>

23:06.960 --> 23:11.959
How are you?

23:11.960 --> 23:18.999
<font color="#00FFFF">Good, it's been difficult. But it's</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">positive. I am fine.</font>

23:19.000 --> 23:25.959
It's Charlie and his eyebrows
have grown back.

23:25.960 --> 23:33.959
What have you been up to?

23:33.960 --> 23:38.999
<font color="#FFFF00">I have been partying with Georgia.</font>

23:39.000 --> 23:45.959
<font color="#FFFF00">It's the same one, it's good. You</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">can come along.</font>

23:45.960 --> 23:49.159
Rumour has that you have left the
WhatsApp group.

23:49.160 --> 23:51.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, this malarkey.</font>

23:51.960 --> 23:57.959
<font color="#00FFFF">We were removed.</font>

23:57.960 --> 24:06.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Then, obviously it was me that left</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the WhatsApp group</font>

24:06.960 --> 24:08.959
<font color="#00FFFF">because it would be, wouldn't it?</font>

24:08.960 --> 24:12.959
No, because you are loyal.

24:12.960 --> 24:15.959
Our islanders, everybody.

24:15.960 --> 24:19.479
(CHEERING)

24:19.480 --> 24:23.959
If you are sat at home thinking you
would love to meet Georgia

24:23.960 --> 24:32.959
or have a selfie with Jack and Dani,
head to the website...

24:32.960 --> 24:35.959
I look forward to seeing you.

24:35.960 --> 24:41.999
Do Josh and Kaz have a future
together?

24:42.000 --> 24:44.960
Let's go to the outside world to
find out.

24:50.480 --> 24:53.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Coming back to the airport was</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">madness.</font>

24:53.960 --> 24:59.959
<font color="#00FFFF">The flashes of the cameras as well,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I didn't know what was going on.</font>

24:59.960 --> 25:01.999
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, my best side.</font>

25:02.000 --> 25:04.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Fun.</font>

25:04.960 --> 25:10.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Seeing your face on the front cover</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">of a magazine.</font>

25:10.960 --> 25:13.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Josh and Kaz are soul mates.</font>

25:13.960 --> 25:15.959
<font color="#FFFF00">The most successful couple.</font>

25:15.960 --> 25:18.639
<font color="#00FFFF">That's lovely.</font>

25:18.640 --> 25:20.959
<font color="#00FFFF">We need to get ready to see our</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">friends.</font>

25:20.960 --> 25:25.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm so excited.</font>

25:28.960 --> 25:31.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, my God!</font>

25:36.960 --> 25:39.799
<font color="#FFFF00">Smiling.</font>

25:39.800 --> 25:45.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Kaz literally does not stop talking</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">about you.</font>

25:45.960 --> 25:48.959
<font color="#FFFF00">What was it like?</font>

25:48.960 --> 25:54.959
<font color="#FFFF00">We don't get an idea about how</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">serious the decisions were.</font>

25:54.960 --> 25:57.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I realise that might have caused a</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">stir.</font>

25:57.960 --> 26:01.959
<font color="#11FF11">When Kaz came in, we thought, there</font>
<font color="#11FF11">it is.</font>

26:01.960 --> 26:08.959
<font color="#00FFFF">On our side, we thought maybe</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Georgia.</font>

26:08.960 --> 26:14.959
<font color="#FFFF00">It was hard to see how big a</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">decision would be for everyone.</font>

26:14.960 --> 26:17.959
<font color="#11FF11">We were fuming.</font>

26:17.960 --> 26:20.959
<font color="#00FFFF">We were like, yes!</font>

26:20.960 --> 26:23.959
<font color="#11FF11">You guys are so happy and it was</font>
<font color="#11FF11">all fine</font>

26:23.960 --> 26:27.959
<font color="#11FF11">apart from when you got so</font>
<font color="#11FF11">comfortable.</font>

26:27.960 --> 26:31.959
<font color="#11FF11">Hands behind your head, saying that</font>
<font color="#11FF11">girls should always wear make-up.</font>

26:31.960 --> 26:34.959
<font color="#11FF11">They should never take their</font>
<font color="#11FF11">make-up.</font>

26:34.960 --> 26:37.999
<font color="#00FFFF">Let's talk about that. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> That was</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">misconstrued.</font>

26:38.000 --> 26:42.999
<font color="#FFFF00">What I meant to say was it's nice</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">when girls dress up for you.</font>

26:43.000 --> 26:48.639
<font color="#11FF11">What is next for you as a couple?</font>

26:48.640 --> 26:53.959
<font color="#FFFF00">It's nice to just do normal things.</font>

26:53.960 --> 27:00.320
<font color="#00FFFF">Cheers.</font>

27:02.960 --> 27:06.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Red carpet tonight, getting the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">glam on.</font>

27:06.960 --> 27:09.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Are you looking forward to it? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I'm</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">nervous.</font>

27:09.960 --> 27:15.000
<font color="#FFFF00">We will be on the red carpet in our</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">own right, which is strange.</font>

27:17.960 --> 27:22.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I think you will be the star of the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">show. You look unreal.</font>

27:22.960 --> 27:24.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Thank you. You are so cute.</font>

27:32.960 --> 27:36.959
<font color="#00FFFF">It's my first red carpet</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and I am so happy we did it.</font>

27:36.960 --> 27:38.960
<font color="#FFFF00">We've got more to come.</font>

27:40.960 --> 27:46.959
A match made in heaven and my, are
they easy on the eye.

27:46.960 --> 27:49.960
It's Josh and Kaz.

27:55.960 --> 27:57.959
You are gorgeous.

27:57.960 --> 28:03.959
(CHEERING) Are you all right?

28:03.960 --> 28:07.959
How was your first week since
leaving the villa?

28:07.960 --> 28:13.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Just getting back to normal life.</font>

28:13.960 --> 28:15.959
<font color="#00FFFF">It was mad.</font>

28:15.960 --> 28:23.159
<font color="#FFFF00">People walking down the street are</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">saying they need a photo.</font>

28:23.160 --> 28:31.799
<font color="#FFFF00">People are into it.</font>

28:31.800 --> 28:38.959
What was it like meeting friends?

28:38.960 --> 28:45.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I always knew my friends would get</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">on with his friends. We talked.</font>

28:45.960 --> 28:48.959
<font color="#FFFF00">They already had mutual friends.</font>

28:48.960 --> 28:51.959
<font color="#FFFF00">They were in a WhatsApp group</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">together.</font>

28:51.960 --> 28:55.799
<font color="#FFFF00">We are not even allowed in that.</font>

28:55.800 --> 29:02.959
You are holding hands. You walked
your first red carpet this week.

29:02.960 --> 29:04.639
What was that like?

29:04.640 --> 29:11.319
<font color="#00FFFF">I literally walked on the red</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">carpet and it was singles of Kaz.</font>

29:11.320 --> 29:18.159
<font color="#00FFFF">I was stood on the side like a</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">lemon.</font>

29:18.160 --> 29:22.959
Your connection was so instant.

29:22.960 --> 29:24.159
At what point did you realise

29:24.160 --> 29:26.959
you were going to bring Kaz back to
the villa?

29:26.960 --> 29:31.319
<font color="#FFFF00">Early doors. I will probably get</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">into trouble for that.</font>

29:31.320 --> 29:34.959
What do you mean early doors?

29:34.960 --> 29:43.639
<font color="#FFFF00">Probably the end of</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the first night. The last night.</font>

29:43.640 --> 29:49.959
<font color="#FFFF00">It was awkward.</font>

29:49.960 --> 29:54.959
<font color="#FFFF00">The bed situation chopped and</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">changed a bit.</font>

29:54.960 --> 29:57.959
<font color="#FFFF00">We were right next to Georgia and</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Wes.</font>

29:57.960 --> 30:04.959
<font color="#FFFF00">And at one point we woke up and I</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">had put the pillow on my head.</font>

30:04.960 --> 30:11.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I was like a leper.</font>

30:11.960 --> 30:13.999
<font color="#00FFFF">I was worried about Josh.</font>

30:14.000 --> 30:17.639
When you arrived in the village, you
seemed to fall pretty hard.

30:17.640 --> 30:19.960
Look at this.

30:21.000 --> 30:26.479
<font color="#00FFFF">Honestly, it's really hit me today</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">how much I like Josh.</font>

30:26.480 --> 30:28.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Honestly.</font>

30:28.960 --> 30:33.959
<font color="#00FFFF">He is exactly</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">what I look for in a guy.</font>

30:33.960 --> 30:36.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm scared of this.</font>

30:36.960 --> 30:41.959
<font color="#00FFFF">We have shared moments.</font>

30:41.960 --> 30:43.959
<font color="#00FFFF">You know when it</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">feels right to say it.</font>

30:43.960 --> 30:45.479
<font color="#FFFF00">It's the most romantic place</font>

30:45.480 --> 30:47.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I have ever been in my life.</font>

30:47.960 --> 30:49.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I love you.</font>

30:49.960 --> 30:51.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I love you too.</font>

30:56.960 --> 30:58.320
(CHEERING)

30:59.960 --> 31:02.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

31:02.960 --> 31:05.959
Kaz, why were you scared of things
on the outside?

31:05.960 --> 31:12.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Just because I've been hurt in the</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">past.</font>

31:12.960 --> 31:18.959
<font color="#00FFFF">And he's not showing any red flags.</font>

31:18.960 --> 31:21.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Not so far.</font>

31:21.960 --> 31:26.959
<font color="#00FFFF">When it's so good, you don't want</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">it to go wrong.</font>

31:26.960 --> 31:30.959
Have you had an argument since you
came out?

31:30.960 --> 31:38.959
<font color="#FFFF00">No. Prince, but he is gone.</font>

31:38.960 --> 31:46.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Everything was fast-paced in the</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">villa.</font>

31:46.960 --> 31:50.159
<font color="#00FFFF">The first day,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I was his girlfriend.</font>

31:50.160 --> 31:55.959
<font color="#00FFFF">We are starting slowly.</font>

31:55.960 --> 31:59.959
<font color="#00FFFF">We don't live too far from each</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">other either.</font>

31:59.960 --> 32:04.159
You have been fantastic. Let's have
a look at your best bits.

32:04.160 --> 32:08.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Who is that?</font>

32:08.960 --> 32:11.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

32:11.960 --> 32:15.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I am spoilt for choice.</font>

32:15.960 --> 32:19.319
<font color="#FFFF00">It's a good situation to be in.</font>

32:19.320 --> 32:24.959
<font color="#FFFF00">You know I like you.</font>

32:24.960 --> 32:26.959
<font color="#FFFF00">It's only upwards from here</font>

32:26.960 --> 32:28.959
<font color="#FFFF00">unless you mess up.</font>

32:28.960 --> 32:30.959
<font color="#11FF11">Welcome to Casa Amor.</font>

32:30.960 --> 32:33.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I can't see any problems</font>

32:33.960 --> 32:39.959
<font color="#FFFF00">but maybe this could cause some.</font>

32:39.960 --> 32:42.960
<font color="#FFFF00">She's spun my head 360.</font>

32:46.960 --> 32:48.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

32:58.960 --> 33:01.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Things are so good</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">with Josh right now.</font>

33:01.960 --> 33:02.999
<font color="#FFFF00">Will you be my girlfriend?</font>

33:03.000 --> 33:05.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Yes.</font>

33:05.960 --> 33:08.319
<font color="#FFFF00">I am blessed to have found</font>

33:08.320 --> 33:09.999
<font color="#FFFF00">not just a girlfriend</font>

33:10.000 --> 33:11.959
<font color="#FFFF00">but a best friend.</font>

33:11.960 --> 33:13.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I love you.</font>

33:13.960 --> 33:17.639
<font color="#11FF11">I am so proud of you. I can't wait</font>
<font color="#11FF11">for you to get back.</font>

33:17.640 --> 33:21.480
<font color="#FFFF00">See you soon.</font>

33:22.960 --> 33:24.959
(CHEERING)

33:24.960 --> 33:28.640
Josh and Kaz, everybody.

33:30.960 --> 33:33.959
How are we getting on with the
after-party? Alex?

33:33.960 --> 33:36.959
<font color="#FFFF00">It's all good.</font>

33:36.960 --> 33:41.319
When we come back,

33:41.320 --> 33:46.960
the kilt will be listed on their
romantic trip to Scotland.

33:50.960 --> 33:53.160
<font color="#FFFF00">Have you got boxers on?</font>

33:55.960 --> 33:57.960
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

34:02.960 --> 34:04.960
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

34:09.960 --> 34:13.958
Welcome back to Love Island: The
Reunion.

34:13.960 --> 34:18.478
We couldn't have all of our 38
islanders here

34:18.480 --> 34:21.958
without dusting off the old lie
detector.

34:21.960 --> 34:24.960
Are you having a good time?
(CHEERING)

34:26.960 --> 34:29.960
All still getting on with each
other?

34:32.000 --> 34:37.319
Awkward. We have some new islanders.
Adam is here.

34:37.320 --> 34:44.958
Rumour has it you have had
matching tattoos.

34:44.960 --> 34:49.958
<font color="#FFFF00">Mine is stick-on.</font>

34:49.960 --> 34:54.958
Yours is tiny.

34:54.960 --> 34:58.639
If you break up, you could still be
airbrushed.

34:58.640 --> 35:01.479
You have a Z.

35:01.480 --> 35:04.639
That could be anything.

35:04.640 --> 35:07.959
How are you two getting on?

35:07.960 --> 35:10.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Really good.</font>

35:10.960 --> 35:14.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm happy.</font>

35:14.960 --> 35:18.959
Look, we have Niall.

35:18.960 --> 35:24.959
<font color="#11FF11">I have been living my best life and</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I am still searching for my rainbow.</font>

35:24.960 --> 35:27.959
We missed you.

35:27.960 --> 35:30.799
We have Kendall.

35:30.800 --> 35:36.959
The last time you were on the show,
we introduced you to a certain Kem.

35:36.960 --> 35:39.959
What happened?

35:39.960 --> 35:43.959
<font color="#00FFFF">We are just friends.</font>

35:43.960 --> 35:49.799
He is cute. <font color="#00FFFF">He is.</font>

35:49.800 --> 35:54.959
Laura's prayers were eventually
answered

35:54.960 --> 35:57.959
by a hunky, bearded carpenter.

35:57.960 --> 35:59.959
Since leaving the villa,

35:59.960 --> 36:01.959
she was keen to take him on the
pilgrimage

36:01.960 --> 36:03.960
to the holy land of Scotland.

36:06.960 --> 36:10.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I can't take you to Scotland</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">without getting you a kilt.</font>

36:10.960 --> 36:13.000
<font color="#00FFFF">I can't wait to wear it.</font>

36:15.960 --> 36:19.480
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, my God. Have you got boxers on?</font>

36:26.960 --> 36:28.959
<font color="#FFFF00">That's so cute.</font>

36:28.960 --> 36:33.959
<font color="#FFFF00">If we got married, you would have</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to wear a kilt, you realise that?</font>

36:33.960 --> 36:38.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I think I will wear them every day.</font>

36:38.960 --> 36:45.960
<font color="#FFFF00">You wear a skirt.</font>

36:49.000 --> 36:51.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I finally get to meet the friends</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and family.</font>

36:51.960 --> 36:58.959
<font color="#FFFF00">It will be so good. They are dying</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to meet you.</font>

36:58.960 --> 37:05.960
<font color="#11FF11">Hello. Nice to meet you.</font>

37:07.480 --> 37:11.959
<font color="#00FFFF">How did you feel seeing Laura on</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Love Island? All the drama?</font>

37:11.960 --> 37:16.959
<font color="#11FF11">Do you like him?</font>

37:16.960 --> 37:18.959
<font color="#FFFF00">He seems nice.</font>

37:18.960 --> 37:21.999
<font color="#11FF11">I think you seem lovely.</font>

37:22.000 --> 37:25.959
<font color="#FFFF00">He had a lot of dignity and class.</font>

37:25.960 --> 37:27.639
<font color="#11FF11">What do you mean?</font>

37:27.640 --> 37:32.479
<font color="#FFFF00">The dumpings.</font>

37:32.480 --> 37:36.479
<font color="#11FF11">And the public love you because of</font>
<font color="#11FF11">the way you acted.</font>

37:36.480 --> 37:39.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Cheers.</font>

37:53.960 --> 37:55.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Welcome to Loch Lomond.</font>

37:55.960 --> 37:58.479
<font color="#00FFFF">I am glad you took me.</font>

37:58.480 --> 38:01.959
<font color="#FFFF00">What was that? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I don't know.</font>

38:01.960 --> 38:09.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Back to reality.</font>

38:09.960 --> 38:12.319
<font color="#00FFFF">This is jokes.</font>

38:12.320 --> 38:13.959
<font color="#00FFFF">This is awesome.</font>

38:13.960 --> 38:17.799
<font color="#FFFF00">Cheers to the rain, cheers to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Scotland. Thank you so much.</font>

38:17.800 --> 38:20.959
<font color="#FFFF00">It was really funny.</font>

38:20.960 --> 38:23.959
<font color="#FFFF00">You have a wet nose.</font>

38:23.960 --> 38:25.999
(CHEERING)

38:26.000 --> 38:33.159
She has been on cloud nine ever
since cool Paul flew into the villa.

38:33.160 --> 38:35.959
Are they part of the mile high club
yet? Let's find out.

38:35.960 --> 38:38.960
It's Laura and Paul.

38:47.960 --> 38:51.319
Hello, guys. I love that.

38:51.320 --> 38:56.959
How has the first week been for both
of you?

38:56.960 --> 39:01.959
<font color="#FFFF00">A whirlwind. We went to Scotland</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">for two days</font>

39:01.960 --> 39:05.959
<font color="#FFFF00">and have been in London for two</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">days.</font>

39:05.960 --> 39:10.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Nice. We went up to Scotland and it</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">was quiet.</font>

39:10.960 --> 39:15.959
<font color="#00FFFF">We got back and reality set in a</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">bit.</font>

39:15.960 --> 39:20.479
Something is happening, I can feel
it. You were closer.

39:20.480 --> 39:26.959
You look great in a kilt. Is that
something you could get used to?

39:26.960 --> 39:33.479
<font color="#00FFFF">I have worn one before. You feel</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the part. It was nice.</font>

39:33.480 --> 39:36.959
<font color="#FFFF00">He was checking himself out in the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">mirror behind me.</font>

39:36.960 --> 39:40.959
Did you check a sneaky peek?

39:40.960 --> 39:49.639
<font color="#FFFF00">There were loads of people outside.</font>

39:49.640 --> 39:54.319
You were the only couple
in the final who weren't official.

39:54.320 --> 39:57.959
Paul, what is your relationship
status now?

39:57.960 --> 40:06.959
<font color="#00FFFF">The same as it was. It was organic</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">in there.</font>

40:06.960 --> 40:15.959
<font color="#00FFFF">When you come out, you have to meet</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">each other's friends,</font>

40:15.960 --> 40:21.959
<font color="#00FFFF">family, get to know each other's</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">lives.</font>

40:21.960 --> 40:24.799
You are still dating? <font color="#FFFF00">Yes.</font>

40:24.800 --> 40:27.959
Let's talk about kissgate.

40:27.960 --> 40:30.959
I presume you have seen it.

40:30.960 --> 40:34.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes.</font>

40:40.960 --> 40:47.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, Laura, darling. If I meant it</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that way...</font>

40:47.960 --> 40:53.959
Laura, what do you make of it?

40:53.960 --> 40:56.959
Was that a confusing time for you?

40:56.960 --> 40:59.959
<font color="#FFFF00">It wasn't that confusing.</font>

40:59.960 --> 41:03.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I did believe Jack straightaway but</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">it was difficult</font>

41:03.960 --> 41:05.959
<font color="#FFFF00">because Georgia seemed so adamant</font>

41:05.960 --> 41:10.959
<font color="#FFFF00">and swayed my decision as to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">what to do with Jack.</font>

41:10.960 --> 41:15.319
<font color="#FFFF00">She was telling me, why don't you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">believe me?</font>

41:15.320 --> 41:19.959
<font color="#FFFF00">But I did believe Jack</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">straightaway.</font>

41:19.960 --> 41:25.319
<font color="#FFFF00">It was funny. You are literally,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">give me your face.</font>

41:25.320 --> 41:31.959
Have you got anything else to say to
Laura?

41:31.960 --> 41:40.959
<font color="#00FFFF">If I had remembered it that way, I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">would have said sorry straightaway.</font>

41:40.960 --> 41:43.639
Things might not have worked out
with you and Jack

41:43.640 --> 41:45.959
but there was somebody else you had
your eye on.

41:45.960 --> 41:50.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I really fancy Eamonn Holmes.</font>

41:50.960 --> 41:56.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I think he and Ruth are so cute</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">together.</font>

41:58.960 --> 42:01.959
What is it about Eamonn Holmes?

42:01.960 --> 42:06.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I feel like it is blown up. I just</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">really love him.</font>

42:06.960 --> 42:08.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I think he is such a cool guy.</font>

42:08.960 --> 42:13.959
<font color="#FFFF00">He was on one of my friend's</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">flights and I was so jealous.</font>

42:13.960 --> 42:16.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I like the relationship between him</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and Ruth.</font>

42:16.960 --> 42:22.960
I would love to know what Eamonn
thinks. Let's ask him.

42:23.960 --> 42:25.999
<font color="#FFFF00">Hello, Laura. Eamonn here.</font>

42:26.000 --> 42:32.959
<font color="#FFFF00">You knew that already. Thanks for</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">your lovely words of admiration.</font>

42:32.960 --> 42:35.959
<font color="#FFFF00">You have made</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">an old man very happy.</font>

42:35.960 --> 42:41.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Talk about being happy, I am</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">happily married to the lovely Ruth.</font>

42:41.960 --> 42:48.959
<font color="#FFFF00">The big question is, could I be</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">happier?</font>

42:48.960 --> 42:52.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Because it's times like this when</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you need to...</font>

42:52.960 --> 42:56.639
<font color="#00FFFF">What are you doing?</font>

42:56.640 --> 42:58.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Are you cracking on with Laura?</font>

42:58.960 --> 43:02.999
<font color="#00FFFF">Because you know I am loyal.</font>

43:03.000 --> 43:06.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Don't mug me off.</font>

43:06.960 --> 43:08.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Right?</font>

43:11.960 --> 43:14.959
I love the fact that you said he
messaged you.

43:14.960 --> 43:22.959
<font color="#FFFF00">In a nice way. He just said thanks</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">for the love.</font>

43:22.960 --> 43:27.479
<font color="#FFFF00">I support you. That was it.</font>

43:27.480 --> 43:30.959
We mentioned that Laura, you are
from Scotland,

43:30.960 --> 43:34.159
Paul, you're from Bournemouth. How
are you going to make this work?

43:34.160 --> 43:41.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Easy.</font>

43:41.960 --> 43:44.959
So you are going to make it work?
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes.</font>

43:44.960 --> 43:50.480
Here are your best bits.

43:58.960 --> 44:01.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I do fancy him.</font>

44:03.160 --> 44:05.960
<font color="#FFFF00">His moves are out of this world.</font>

44:13.000 --> 44:15.639
<font color="#FFFF00">Too much sausage.</font>

44:15.640 --> 44:19.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I heard a creak</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">on the bed and then...</font>

44:26.960 --> 44:28.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I will be talking</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to Megan more often.</font>

44:28.960 --> 44:33.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Did she just call me a slag?</font>

44:33.960 --> 44:41.959
Who would you like to be with?

44:41.960 --> 44:45.479
<font color="#FFFF00">Slow down, Laura. It's not a race.</font>

44:45.480 --> 44:49.480
<font color="#FFFF00">Another one bites the dust, eh?</font>

44:51.960 --> 44:56.319
<font color="#FFFF00">I feel more happy</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with you than I did with Jack.</font>

44:56.320 --> 45:02.479
<font color="#FFFF00">It's not about you any more.</font>

45:02.480 --> 45:05.319
<font color="#FFFF00">Do you love Laura?</font>

45:05.320 --> 45:06.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Yes.</font>

<font color="#11FF11">We are proud of you.</font>

45:09.960 --> 45:13.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Don't say that.</font>

45:13.960 --> 45:20.960
<font color="#11FF11">You are absolutely brilliant.</font>

45:24.960 --> 45:28.479
Laura and Paul, everybody.

45:28.480 --> 45:34.959
Time to check on our winning couple
after the break.

45:34.960 --> 45:37.959
Don't go anywhere.

45:37.960 --> 45:46.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm on that side normally.</font>

46:01.640 --> 46:04.959
Welcome back to Love Island: The
Reunion!

46:04.960 --> 46:07.959
They got together in the first week,

46:07.960 --> 46:09.959
and the writing has been on the wall
ever since,

46:09.960 --> 46:12.959
along with a massive picture of her
dad.

46:12.960 --> 46:16.999
Here is what happened since Dani and
Jack headed home.

46:17.000 --> 46:21.959
<font color="#FFFF00">It's surreal.</font>

46:21.960 --> 46:26.959
<font color="#FFFF00">This is where I worked.</font>

46:26.960 --> 46:31.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I go to that Co-op up there.</font>

46:31.960 --> 46:35.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I will take you down there.</font>

46:35.960 --> 46:40.960
<font color="#00FFFF">You know what? I've got a winner.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Thank you. I love you.</font>

46:43.800 --> 46:47.319
(CHEERING)

46:47.320 --> 46:54.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Hello.</font>

46:54.960 --> 46:59.959
<font color="#11FF11">Seeing Jack today, Jack done</font>
<font color="#11FF11">amazing.</font>

46:59.960 --> 47:03.959

47:03.960 --> 47:07.959
<font color="#FFFF00">It's Jack calling. How are you?</font>

47:07.960 --> 47:13.959
<font color="#00FFFF">You know Leonardo DiCaprio from</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">The Wolf Of Wall Street?</font>

47:13.960 --> 47:20.959
<font color="#00FFFF">He's convinced me I want a pen.</font>

47:20.960 --> 47:27.960
<font color="#00FFFF">It's only Dani calling, how are you</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">today?</font>

47:29.800 --> 47:33.799
<font color="#00FFFF">Yes, I'm very well.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Are you enjoying the hot weather?</font>

47:33.800 --> 47:36.479

47:36.480 --> 47:39.959
<font color="#FFFF00">She can have a job here.</font>

47:39.960 --> 47:42.799
<font color="#FFFF00">Send a CV in.</font>

47:42.800 --> 47:45.639
<font color="#00FFFF">I might have a job!</font>

47:45.640 --> 47:48.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Coming down to Jack's work has been</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">such a beautiful thing.</font>

47:48.960 --> 47:53.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Now, I am going to take him to the</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">pub.</font>

47:55.000 --> 48:01.799

<font color="#00FFFF">babe?</font>

48:01.800 --> 48:05.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm so excited, though, Jack, for</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you to meet everyone at the pub.</font>

48:10.960 --> 48:12.960
(CHEERING)

48:16.960 --> 48:19.959
<font color="#00FFFF">So beautiful!</font>

48:19.960 --> 48:24.959
<font color="#00FFFF">You've all dressed up for me,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">haven't you?</font>

48:24.960 --> 48:30.959
<font color="#FFFF00">It's actually really nice meeting</font>

<font color="#11FF11">Really, really proud of you.</font>

48:41.960 --> 48:47.799
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm going to teach</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Jack to pull the perfect pint.</font>

48:47.800 --> 48:53.159
<font color="#00FFFF">Bringing Jack into the pub, it was</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">just perfect.</font>

48:53.160 --> 48:54.959
<font color="#00FFFF">All I could ever want.</font>

48:54.960 --> 49:00.159

He's our answer to WH Smith

49:16.320 --> 49:20.799
and for the first time she is the
most famous Dani in her family.

49:20.800 --> 49:24.959
Please show your appreciation, it is
Jack and Dani!

49:24.960 --> 49:25.960
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

49:37.480 --> 49:40.959
Love the new hair, Dani.

49:40.960 --> 49:44.959
It looks gorgeous.
How has the last week been?

49:44.960 --> 49:48.639
<font color="#FFFF00">People come asking for photos,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I go, 'Do you want me to take it?'</font>

49:48.640 --> 49:51.959
<font color="#FFFF00">They go, no, of you.</font>

49:51.960 --> 50:00.959
Are you impressed by Jack's sales
techniques?

50:00.960 --> 50:05.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I thought it was so important</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">showing her the office.</font>

50:05.960 --> 50:08.999
Have you met Danny Dyer yet?

50:09.000 --> 50:15.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Not yet, we've texted quite a lot,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">but I'm more scared of her mum.</font>

50:15.960 --> 50:20.959
<font color="#00FFFF">She is a bit scary.</font>

50:20.960 --> 50:26.959
Have you done bits yet?

50:26.960 --> 50:32.959
(CHEERING)

50:32.960 --> 50:36.479
We know you've been a bit of a
naughty boy in the past.

50:36.480 --> 50:39.959
Why is it different with Dani?

50:39.960 --> 50:45.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I've never met somebody that I</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">really, really love.</font>

50:45.960 --> 50:50.999
<font color="#FFFF00">I've said it so many times, Mum</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">said,</font>

50:51.000 --> 50:55.959
<font color="#FFFF00">'When you meet somebody, you know, '</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">so that is why it is different.</font>

50:55.960 --> 50:58.959
(CHEERING)

50:58.960 --> 51:04.959
How have you found it on the outside
so far?

51:04.960 --> 51:07.959
<font color="#00FFFF">It has been really good with Jack,</font>

51:07.960 --> 51:11.959
<font color="#00FFFF">he makes me feel like, all the</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">happiness.</font>

51:11.960 --> 51:18.959
<font color="#00FFFF">We haven't left each other's side,</font>

51:18.960 --> 51:26.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I've never been able to plan the</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">future with someone.</font>

51:26.960 --> 51:31.159
A few days ago you were photographed
looking a bit upset in your car.

51:31.160 --> 51:33.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I was talking to Samira.</font>

51:33.960 --> 51:36.959
<font color="#00FFFF">This is when Frankie told Samira he</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">loved her,</font>

51:36.960 --> 51:39.999
<font color="#00FFFF">and I was like, oh, my God!</font>

51:40.000 --> 51:47.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I was blamed, because I was not</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">there.</font>

51:47.960 --> 51:53.959
<font color="#00FFFF">It's quite scary that somebody has</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">videoed me.</font>

51:53.960 --> 51:59.159
In the villa, you didn't deal with
Casa Amor very well.

51:59.160 --> 52:02.959
How are you going to handle it if
Jack goes on a boys' holiday?

52:02.960 --> 52:10.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I will fly out there!</font>

52:10.960 --> 52:13.959
Once you returned from Casa Amor,

52:13.960 --> 52:16.959
your relationship seemed to really
develop

52:16.960 --> 52:19.960
into that of, like, an old married
couple. Take a look.

52:21.960 --> 52:23.959
<font color="#FFFF00">What about a roast dinner?</font>

52:23.960 --> 52:28.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I can't cook for 16 people...</font>

52:28.960 --> 52:31.999
<font color="#00FFFF">All right!</font>

52:32.000 --> 52:36.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, my God.</font>

52:36.960 --> 52:42.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Do not eat the food yet, Jack.</font>

52:42.960 --> 52:45.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm not eating it, Dan.</font>

52:45.960 --> 52:49.639
<font color="#FFFF00">I want to be with you, because you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">make a really nice breakfast.</font>

52:49.640 --> 52:51.640
(BOTH LAUGH)

52:53.960 --> 52:56.959
(CHEERING)

52:56.960 --> 52:58.959
What have your friends made of it
all?

52:58.960 --> 53:03.639
<font color="#00FFFF">They love it, they love Jack as</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">well.</font>

53:03.640 --> 53:05.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I went on a double date yesterday.</font>

53:05.960 --> 53:12.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I took her out with my two best</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">mates. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> It's been amazing.</font>

53:12.960 --> 53:15.959
I hear
you are planning to get a dog.

53:15.960 --> 53:20.319
Is this true? <font color="#FFFF00">Yes, who doesn't love</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">dogs?</font>

53:20.320 --> 53:24.639
<font color="#FFFF00">She doesn't want it in the bed.</font>

53:24.640 --> 53:29.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I have to follow him around the</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">house picking his pants up...</font>

53:29.960 --> 53:34.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I have to pick pooh up.</font>

53:34.960 --> 53:44.799
Let's talk about living together.

53:44.800 --> 53:46.959
Have you looked for any houses yet?

53:46.960 --> 53:51.959
<font color="#FFFF00">We have looked, but we haven't</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">physically gone into any places.</font>

53:51.960 --> 53:57.959
We thought we'd get you a new
present,

53:57.960 --> 54:03.959
as you lost your last poster...

54:03.960 --> 54:07.959
There is you, there's Dani, there is
Danny Dyer there.

54:07.960 --> 54:14.999
<font color="#FFFF00">That is going above the bed!</font>

54:15.000 --> 54:18.959
(CHEERING)

54:18.960 --> 54:21.959
What are you going to spend your 50
grand on?

54:21.960 --> 54:23.999
<font color="#FFFF00">More of these!</font>

54:24.000 --> 54:27.959
<font color="#00FFFF">We've just been eating.</font>

54:27.960 --> 54:31.959
<font color="#FFFF00">All we ever do is eating, literally.</font>

54:31.960 --> 54:37.159
<font color="#FFFF00">Probably something towards the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">house. A nice sofa.</font>

54:37.160 --> 54:44.959
We have heard the M word mentioned
quite a lot in the press.

54:44.960 --> 54:47.959
Is it true? Jack. <font color="#FFFF00">We are gonna get</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">married eventually,</font>

54:47.960 --> 54:51.959
<font color="#FFFF00">but not in the next year.</font>

54:51.960 --> 54:54.959
<font color="#00FFFF">We need to enjoy it all.</font>

54:54.960 --> 55:01.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Marriage is stress. I will be a</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">bridezilla.</font>

55:01.960 --> 55:05.799
<font color="#00FFFF">I will want everything.</font>

55:05.800 --> 55:10.960
You've been fantastic islanders.
These are your best bits.

55:18.960 --> 55:21.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I think Dani's lovely.</font>

55:21.960 --> 55:27.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I sell pens, mate.</font>

55:29.320 --> 55:32.159
<font color="#00FFFF">If you want me</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to be your girlfriend,</font>

55:32.160 --> 55:35.959
<font color="#00FFFF">things have to start changing.</font>

55:35.960 --> 55:41.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I wanted to know, if you wanted to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">be my girlfriend.</font>

55:44.960 --> 55:52.799
<font color="#00FFFF">I've been sitting here for the past</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">few days</font>

55:52.800 --> 55:54.960
<font color="#00FFFF">and he's been with an ex-bird,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">like...</font>

56:00.640 --> 56:03.960

# You got the love... #

<font color="#FFFF00">Oh!</font>

56:28.960 --> 56:37.959
<font color="#FFFF00">That's the most action I've had!</font>

56:37.960 --> 56:41.959
<font color="#FFFF00">My mum was right when she told me,</font>

56:41.960 --> 56:46.960
<font color="#FFFF00">when you are in love with somebody,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you just know.</font>

56:47.960 --> 56:51.960
Dani and Jack!

56:53.640 --> 56:55.960
Jack and Dani, everyone!

56:57.960 --> 57:01.959
When we come back, it is award
season,

57:01.960 --> 57:07.959
as we host the biggest award show of
them all. It is the Muggys!

57:35.960 --> 57:37.999
Ladies and gentlemen,

57:38.000 --> 57:42.959
welcome to the second annual Love
Island awards: the Muggys.

57:42.960 --> 57:51.959
A nomination is enough to be amongst
Love Island folklore.

57:51.960 --> 57:54.959
Previous winners include the likes
of Kem

57:54.960 --> 57:57.959
and of course Muggy Mike himself.

57:57.960 --> 58:04.960
<font color="#FFFF00">They're all vying for one of these,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the much coveted Muggy.</font>

58:07.960 --> 58:11.959
The first award of the evening is
for the Best Dramatic Performance.

58:11.960 --> 58:13.959
With so much drama in the villa this
year,

58:13.960 --> 58:16.959
it was impossible to pick just four
nominations.

58:16.960 --> 58:21.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Here they are.</font>

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:17.960
<font color="#00FFFF">For me,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I just can't see it working.</font>

01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:22.959
(CHEERING)

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:27.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Congratulations, Laura. How do you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">feel?</font>

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:30.999
<font color="#00FFFF">I feel like I have won.</font>

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.319
<font color="#FFFF00">You can have</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">an actual piece of pie.</font>

01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:40.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I thought you were going to pie</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">me in the face.</font>

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:44.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Back to you in the studio.</font>

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:51.959
Next, the award for somebody who
embodies

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:55.959
one of the most important, endearing
traits an islander can display.

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:58.959
In the dictionary against this word,

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:02.959
you will find a picture of this
islander's face staring back at you.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.960
The word is "loyal."

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:15.959
<font color="#00FFFF">You know me</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">when it comes to loyalty.</font>

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:19.959
<font color="#00FFFF">My loyalties lie with Laura.</font>

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:24.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Just by saying you are loyal 20</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">times a day doesn't make you loyal.</font>

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:26.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Loyal... </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Loyal...</font>

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:34.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I am loyal, babe.</font>

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:40.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Georgia, she is loyal!</font>

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:45.959
<font color="#11FF11">I am loyal, I am real.</font>

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:51.799
<font color="#00FFFF">I am loyal, remember?</font>

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:54.800
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm honest and loyal. Remember</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that.</font>

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.959
She is an honorary member of the
loyal family.

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:02.959
The award goes to Georgia Steel!

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:08.999
<font color="#FFFF00">How do you feel? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I think loyalty is</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">a good trait to have.</font>

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:17.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Caroline, back to you.</font>

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:23.959
Next up is the award for absolute
LOLs.

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:26.999
This is given to commemorate the
funniest moment of the series

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.960
and has nothing to do with Iain
Stirling.

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:40.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Danny and Megan, for teaching</font>

<font color="#FFFF00">pushchair race.</font>

01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:55.959

01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:59.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Jack, for walking in on Megan and</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Wes doing bits.</font>

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:06.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Am I that awkward geezer?</font>

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:12.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm sorry. See you later.</font>

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:17.959
(CHEERING)

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:23.959

<font color="#FFFF00">funniest moment of the series?</font>

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:31.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I can't wait to go round their</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">house.</font>

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:39.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah, no more of that.</font>

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:42.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Back to you in the studio.</font>

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:47.959

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:51.959

A huge thank you to all of our

What a summer it's been.

01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:20.959
Eight weeks of romance, re-coupling,
laughter and loyalty.

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:23.959
The entire nation has been hooked

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:27.960
and here on Aftersun we have loved
every second.

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:35.799

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:40.959

<font color="#FFFF00">Instagram is dirty!</font>

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:52.960
(LAUGHTER)

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:02.959
That guy's got a bit of a crush on
you anyway.

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:06.959
We've had our first hand job!

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:10.319
<font color="#FFFF00">Chemistry is like Chlamydia, you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">have either got it or you haven't.</font>

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:16.959
Jack and Dani.

We've had a tweet from Paris
Hilton...

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:22.959
Oh, my God!

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:24.959
I can't believe I'm on Love Island.

01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:26.960
This is crazy.

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:32.999
(CHEERING)

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:37.959

She's always remained real.

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:48.480
Do you feel like you owe some people
some apologies?

01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:53.159
<font color="#FFFF00">I want to know if you want to be my</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">girlfriend?</font>

Officially a couple!

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:05.959
<font color="#FFFF00">A lady never tells.</font>

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:08.959
<font color="#00FFFF">What is going on?</font>

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:13.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Eh?</font>

01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:15.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Glacial...</font>

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:20.639
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't know what that means.</font>

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:25.959
<font color="#11FF11">I don't have a clue what you are on</font>
<font color="#11FF11">about.</font>

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:32.959
It's a loyalty card.

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:36.960
(CHEERING)

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:41.639

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:46.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I was happy. But could you be</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">happier?</font>

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:52.959
Laughter is the best medicine.

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:54.960
(CHEERING)

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:02.959
Love you, little one. Love you,

What an incredible series it's been

01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:08.959
