WEBVTT

01:58.440 --> 02:00.000
Boardriders is
a team event guys,

02:00.080 --> 02:02.600
So I need you to all support
each other this week all right?

02:03.000 --> 02:05.520
Now, Prawnie's going
to be our open surfer,

02:05.600 --> 02:08.520
and we need an over 40s surfer
in the mix as well so,

02:08.600 --> 02:09.840
I'll put the word out on that.

02:09.960 --> 02:11.840
Last bit of admin.

02:11.960 --> 02:13.360
Guys it is a
Boardriders' Battle,

02:13.480 --> 02:16.160
so we need someone
to lead us into battle.

02:16.240 --> 02:18.120
I'll do it.
I'll be the Captain.

02:18.200 --> 02:20.760
Ah, yeah right.
What are your qualifications?

02:20.840 --> 02:22.480
I know how the other team surf.

02:22.560 --> 02:24.840
And my State rankings
are better than yours.

02:24.920 --> 02:26.560
And mine
are better than yours.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.360
Ah look Marlon,
I appreciate the enthusiasm,

02:28.480 --> 02:30.120
but I'm going to make
Poppy Captain.

02:30.200 --> 02:31.840
Okay.

02:31.920 --> 02:36.360
Mum always did it before,
so, it's only fitting.

02:36.440 --> 02:38.040
The baton has now
been passed on.

02:38.280 --> 02:40.680
-On ya Pops.
-On ya Pops.

02:42.520 --> 02:43.440
Good choice.

02:43.520 --> 02:44.520
Okay, listen up.

02:44.600 --> 02:46.000
There's a bunch of great Clubs
heading our way,

02:46.080 --> 02:48.120
but the way I see it, this
is the first time we've had

02:48.200 --> 02:50.400
a real chance here
winning in years, okay?

02:50.480 --> 02:53.880
So let's fall in, focus up
and let's put in the work yeah?

02:54.040 --> 02:55.400
You got it Manu.

02:56.600 --> 02:57.720
Hey!

02:58.800 --> 03:00.080
You got this.

03:02.120 --> 03:04.200
All right,
let's go train.

03:04.840 --> 03:07.200
Hey Manu, um, have
you got a second?

03:07.280 --> 03:08.280
Yeah, what's up?

03:09.120 --> 03:10.160
I just wanted to say sorry

03:10.240 --> 03:13.360
for going AWOL in the
last round of the 360.

03:13.440 --> 03:16.040
I, got crazy nervous.

03:16.120 --> 03:17.560
Ah that's a pretty
normal reaction

03:17.680 --> 03:19.440
when you surfing in
the big leagues, you know.

03:19.440 --> 03:21.040
And I bet that hold down
didn't help either?

03:21.120 --> 03:24.080
Yeah, no, it was
probably the hold down.

03:24.680 --> 03:28.640
But look I have been
feeling shaky,

03:28.720 --> 03:30.640
and I kinda want to
get past that.

03:30.720 --> 03:32.680
I've got some drills
I've been working on.

03:32.760 --> 03:34.040
I think they may help.

03:34.600 --> 03:36.840
Hey, I've got your back.

03:38.320 --> 03:40.240
-Let me sleep on it.
-Thanks Manu.

03:50.800 --> 03:52.960
So Boardriders doesn't go
towards your State rankings?

03:53.040 --> 03:54.960
Nope, and we get to
surf as a team,

03:55.080 --> 03:56.240
not against each other
like normal.

03:56.320 --> 03:57.360
Hold up,

03:57.480 --> 03:59.760
so I can compete and not
destroy anybody's career/life?

04:00.040 --> 04:02.760
I'm sorry Summer but you're
still not comp standard.

04:02.840 --> 04:04.760
And there's not really
a place for you anyway.

04:04.840 --> 04:08.000
Come on Pops, Summer's improved
a lot. It'll be fun.

04:08.080 --> 04:10.160
Yeah, and who doesn't
love some fun?

04:10.600 --> 04:13.120
Come on Poppy, you're not going
to leave me hanging are you?

04:14.080 --> 04:14.880
Fine!

04:14.960 --> 04:16.360
You can be sub.

04:16.520 --> 04:19.240
Whoo! I'm on the team baby.

04:19.360 --> 04:22.760
Sub just means you'll surf
if someone gets injured.

04:22.840 --> 04:24.320
Hey, well let's hope
that doesn't happen.

04:24.840 --> 04:28.920
You need to take this seriously.
Okay? Both of you.

04:29.640 --> 04:31.960
Now let's get out there
before the swell dies.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.160
You sure you want
to be on the team?

04:44.960 --> 04:48.000
So breathe all the way
in to your belly for four.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.400
And hold for four.

04:52.840 --> 04:55.000
And breathe all
the way out for four.

04:55.400 --> 04:56.800
Nice. Keep doing that.

04:58.440 --> 05:00.400
You just got to remember that
your breathe is a tool yeah.

05:00.520 --> 05:02.080
I feel like a tool.

05:02.600 --> 05:06.560
Actually, I thought we were
working on aerials today.

05:06.880 --> 05:09.960
Yeah we will but Ari got a bit
freaked at the last hold down,

05:10.040 --> 05:12.000
so I bumped this up the list.

05:12.080 --> 05:14.040
Great, yeah great.

05:14.120 --> 05:16.840
Because he got to surf
at Bells and I didn't.

05:16.920 --> 05:19.080
Yeah bro, whatever.

05:19.160 --> 05:21.040
See, see that right there,

05:21.120 --> 05:22.800
that's exactly why
you're not Captain right.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.520
As far as I tell the only person
you think about is yourself.

05:29.080 --> 05:30.840
Someone has to.

05:34.640 --> 05:35.600
We're going to
start simple.

05:35.680 --> 05:38.520
Seeing how long you can
comfortably stay under water.

05:39.240 --> 05:40.360
When you expend energy,

05:40.440 --> 05:43.120
you can still conserve your
breathe if you stay calm.

06:00.200 --> 06:01.320
You okay mate?

06:01.400 --> 06:03.040
All good? Sweet.

06:10.080 --> 06:13.280
This is heat conditions
Bodhi. Put pressure on her.

06:18.120 --> 06:20.320
Stay with her,
don't let her get away.

06:26.280 --> 06:27.520
Bodhs!

06:28.120 --> 06:33.400
Be more aggressive. Go around
her. You're better than her.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.560
Go around her babe.

06:37.960 --> 06:39.600
What are you waiting for.

06:55.160 --> 06:56.480
A hold down
can be deadly

06:56.560 --> 06:58.000
if you don't know
how to handle it.

06:59.640 --> 07:01.800
It's like the
ocean fighting you.

07:02.160 --> 07:04.960
It's got you in a headlock
and it's not letting go.

07:07.360 --> 07:10.200
So I want you to take turns
keeping each other down.

07:11.720 --> 07:15.040
If you can control your breathe,
you can control your fear.

07:17.200 --> 07:19.640
The real battle
is with yourself.

07:31.440 --> 07:33.680
Hey! Hey! What happened?

07:33.800 --> 07:36.240
-Accident.
-What you mean?

07:36.320 --> 07:37.240
I'm okay.

07:37.840 --> 07:41.120
Marlon? Hey get back here.
Where are you going?

07:42.160 --> 07:43.160
Marlon!

07:49.360 --> 07:50.640
What is happening out there?

07:50.720 --> 07:52.240
You're letting
Summer psych you out.

07:52.320 --> 07:53.760
The waves just didn't
come my way.

07:53.840 --> 07:55.320
Yo, she ate my froth.

07:55.400 --> 07:56.360
Ate my froth?

07:56.440 --> 07:57.200
What, not a thing?

07:57.280 --> 07:59.040
You didn't even use
local knowledge.

07:59.120 --> 08:01.200
You could have suckered
Summer big time.

08:01.280 --> 08:02.400
Uh, excuse me.

08:02.480 --> 08:04.760
You know those annoying lefts
that look sick, then close out?

08:04.840 --> 08:05.600
Of course I do.

08:05.680 --> 08:06.920
So use them.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.800
Make it look like
it's an amazing wave.

08:08.880 --> 08:10.960
Like you're going
for 1,000 percent,

08:11.040 --> 08:13.080
then fake out, and let
your opponent wipeout.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.200
But you need to step it up.

08:15.280 --> 08:16.960
No, you need to back off.

08:17.040 --> 08:17.920
I don't tell you how to surf,

08:18.000 --> 08:19.080
so stop telling me.

08:22.320 --> 08:23.160
That was,

08:24.080 --> 08:25.120
intense.

08:25.680 --> 08:28.080
She's just annoyed because
she knows I'm right.

08:34.160 --> 08:37.440
So instead of say a doctor,
a parent,

08:37.520 --> 08:40.440
or any kind of responsible
adult, you talk to Manu.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.240
He's my coach.

08:41.320 --> 08:42.760
He's the perfect person to tell.

08:42.840 --> 08:44.320
What exactly did you tell him?

08:44.400 --> 08:46.360
I told him that
I'd been freaking out

08:46.440 --> 08:48.200
in the surf a little bit,

08:48.280 --> 08:50.800
and that the breath
training really helped.

08:50.880 --> 08:52.920
It was relaxing.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.480
Yeah, so relaxing that
Marlon hit you in the face.

08:55.560 --> 08:59.000
Okay well, that was a bit weird,
but it wasn't Manu's fault.

09:00.480 --> 09:01.560
Hey Thommo, you got a minute?

09:03.240 --> 09:05.080
Ari actually wanted
to tell you something.

09:05.160 --> 09:06.000
What's up?

09:06.960 --> 09:08.280
He was meant to tell you,

09:10.360 --> 09:12.760
that our team needs
a surfer over 40.

09:12.840 --> 09:13.600
You interested?

09:13.680 --> 09:15.320
Oh yeah.

09:15.400 --> 09:16.320
Yeah.

09:16.400 --> 09:17.840
Okay, count me in.

09:17.920 --> 09:20.280
You do realise it's
a competition, yeah?

09:20.360 --> 09:22.960
Like judges and scores
and all that horror.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.480
But it's Boardriders.

09:24.560 --> 09:26.800
It's different.
It's a community thing.

09:26.880 --> 09:28.320
Besides, when do we
ever get to surf

09:28.440 --> 09:30.120
in the same team together?

09:30.200 --> 09:32.520
You are such a great
supportive dad, Thommo.

09:34.200 --> 09:36.360
Oh Poppy made me
sub by the way.

09:36.440 --> 09:37.320
Good for you, Summer.

09:37.400 --> 09:38.160
Yeah.

09:38.240 --> 09:39.160
Wait, you're the sub?

09:39.240 --> 09:40.440
I'm on the team, baby.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.080
So?

10:07.160 --> 10:07.960
Yeah, yeah.

10:08.920 --> 10:11.000
They're going to talk it over,
put it to a vote.

10:11.080 --> 10:12.880
But they seemed
really impressed.

10:19.280 --> 10:21.040
Mum, if I'm going
to be the best

10:21.160 --> 10:23.280
I need to surf
with the best.

10:23.360 --> 10:25.160
Learn from the best.

10:25.240 --> 10:26.720
That's Anchor Cove.

10:26.800 --> 10:29.400
I just wonder if you
thought this through.

10:29.480 --> 10:32.760
You'd be turning your back on
your friends, your community.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.680
I'm not turning my back
on anything.

10:34.760 --> 10:38.560
Do you remember how tough things
were when we first got here?

10:39.080 --> 10:41.240
You were so unhappy.

10:42.000 --> 10:47.000
Then we found Shorehaven,
and it felt like home.

10:47.880 --> 10:50.040
I thought you'd be happy
I'm taking my career seriously.

10:50.120 --> 10:51.840
Don't do that.

10:52.120 --> 10:54.440
I thought you'd
have my back.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.880
I do. Always, my love.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.200
Let's go home. Please...

11:24.560 --> 11:27.400
How did you go
with the girls today?

11:27.480 --> 11:30.880
Bodhi hates me for giving
her some solid advice.

11:31.200 --> 11:32.200
It's all good.

11:32.280 --> 11:34.760
Just say sorry, and bring
her back to the fold.

11:34.840 --> 11:36.160
Why are you on her side?

11:36.240 --> 11:38.400
You said before that she needs
to get tougher in the water.

11:38.520 --> 11:40.960
Yeah, but being Captain is
more about leading by example

11:41.040 --> 11:42.080
than telling people what to do.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.560
Because I don't know
what I'm talking about?

11:43.640 --> 11:44.440
Hey, that's not what I said.

11:44.520 --> 11:45.680
Manu!

11:45.760 --> 11:47.960
Bro, just go easy man.

11:49.000 --> 11:49.960
You know what?

11:50.040 --> 11:51.720
Maybe making you Captain
was a mistake.

11:51.800 --> 11:52.960
What?

11:53.040 --> 11:55.680
There's just too much
pressure on you.

11:55.760 --> 11:56.560
And since Mum died--

11:56.640 --> 11:58.920
Do not bring Mum into this.

11:59.320 --> 12:02.760
I feel like I've,
we've been pushing you too hard.

12:02.840 --> 12:05.840
And you've been pushing
yourself too hard, Pops.

12:05.920 --> 12:08.000
You know when I watch
you surf now it's like,

12:08.080 --> 12:09.840
it's like you've
lost the joy of it.

12:10.720 --> 12:11.760
You know, when you
used to rip it,

12:11.840 --> 12:13.920
and it used to
light you up.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.760
We haven't seen it for ages.

12:15.840 --> 12:16.640
What?

12:16.720 --> 12:19.280
So I'm just meant to
stop trying so hard.

12:19.360 --> 12:20.120
Smile more.

12:20.200 --> 12:21.040
Is that it?

12:22.320 --> 12:23.120
No.

12:23.200 --> 12:26.000
You have no idea how I feel.

12:55.960 --> 12:57.640
This another one
of your drills?

13:09.640 --> 13:11.160
I miss Mum,

13:11.920 --> 13:13.200
so much.

13:22.720 --> 13:24.040
I want to give it a try.

13:58.040 --> 14:00.160
Please make sure
your surfers are registered,

14:00.240 --> 14:02.160
and your team order has
been okayed by the judges.

14:02.240 --> 14:05.640
So I got a little excited
at our training session,

14:05.720 --> 14:07.280
and so did our beloved Captain.

14:08.840 --> 14:10.280
I get why this is
a big deal for her,

14:10.360 --> 14:12.680
but it's a lot, you know?

14:13.720 --> 14:15.400
Too much sometimes.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.440
Well, it's kind of a
compliment, you know?

14:17.520 --> 14:20.360
You pick at the people
we love and believe in.

14:20.440 --> 14:22.560
So just suck it up
and do this for Poppy.

14:22.640 --> 14:23.760
Come on just for today.

14:24.800 --> 14:26.160
And how about you boys?

14:26.240 --> 14:27.840
Ready to represent
for Shorehaven?

14:27.920 --> 14:29.320
Does this answer
your question?

14:31.480 --> 14:33.400
It's upside down,
and we made that, loser.

14:33.480 --> 14:35.080
You literally just got
it out of your van.

14:35.160 --> 14:36.000
Hi, everyone.

14:37.720 --> 14:39.720
Hey, Jackson Bay.
Hey, Anchor Cove.

14:41.120 --> 14:43.560
Just want to say a few
words before we kick off.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.720
Hey, everyone.

14:54.800 --> 14:57.240
Just on behalf of the
Shorehaven Boardriders,

14:57.320 --> 14:59.040
I just want to say welcome.

14:59.120 --> 15:01.640
Kia ora, and it's lovely
to have you guys here.

15:01.720 --> 15:03.400
Now, a lot of you knew
Laynah Te Tahanui

15:03.480 --> 15:05.600
who was our Club President
for many years.

15:06.640 --> 15:07.920
But more importantly...

15:09.320 --> 15:11.040
..she was our mother.

15:13.800 --> 15:17.120
Our family surfs under the
Tetanui name because of her,

15:17.200 --> 15:19.960
and the Boardriders Battle
was always her favourite comp.

15:21.920 --> 15:25.360
She was looking forward
to hosting this event.

15:30.920 --> 15:34.280
So on behalf of us and
on behalf of our whanau,

15:34.360 --> 15:37.280
I just want to say have an
amazing day today, guys.

15:37.360 --> 15:39.720
And we're going to wax ya.

15:40.680 --> 15:41.800
All righty!

15:41.880 --> 15:42.640
Go gear up.

15:42.720 --> 15:43.760
We'll see you out there.

15:48.640 --> 15:51.000
So how exactly
do you surf in a team?

15:51.120 --> 15:53.480
Okay, so they've only got
10 minutes each out there

15:53.640 --> 15:55.200
and only their best wave counts,

15:55.280 --> 15:56.960
and then they have to
get back to the beach

15:57.040 --> 15:58.560
and tag before
the time runs out,

15:58.640 --> 16:00.280
otherwise the team loses points.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.000
Well,
here we go Boardriders.

16:02.080 --> 16:03.920
A huge day of surfing ahead

16:04.000 --> 16:06.720
as heat one is
about to kick off.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.000
This is it.

16:08.080 --> 16:09.920
Shred or be shredded.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.120
-Go, Pops.
-Go Poppy, you can do it.

16:15.440 --> 16:16.840
-Go Poppy.
-And they're off.

16:16.920 --> 16:18.440
Go, Pops.

16:18.520 --> 16:21.080
-Go, Poppy.
-All right, Poppy.

16:22.760 --> 16:24.000
Go Poppy!

16:26.880 --> 16:28.840
Tetanui
chasing her first score.

16:29.080 --> 16:32.360
Oh, I'm not sure why she
didn't take that one.

16:32.440 --> 16:35.320
Maybe an attack of nerves there
from the Shorehaven Captain

16:35.400 --> 16:39.040
as Cassidy from Jarrah Island
takes off like a rocket.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.360
Tetanui goes again.

16:45.440 --> 16:49.400
Pumping for speed, but the wave
closes out, and she bails.

16:55.640 --> 16:59.560
Here's Sheridan Morehouse
on the best wave of the set.

16:59.640 --> 17:02.520
Some surfers just make it
look so easy, don't they?

17:02.760 --> 17:03.840
Let's go for it.

17:03.920 --> 17:04.680
Go, go, go.

17:04.760 --> 17:06.680
The riders
racing to the tag point

17:06.760 --> 17:08.640
to avoid a time penalty.

17:08.720 --> 17:10.400
Tetanui just makes it.

17:10.480 --> 17:12.960
But her best wave
was only a 3.5.

17:13.040 --> 17:14.040
Nice, nice.

17:14.120 --> 17:16.880
When was the last time
Thommo surfed in a comp?

17:16.960 --> 17:17.920
Mate, I don't know.

17:18.000 --> 17:18.960
Late nineties.

17:19.040 --> 17:21.280
I'll be surprised if he
can pull off a single turn.

17:21.360 --> 17:23.280
Hey, where's Luciana today?

17:23.360 --> 17:26.040
Yeah, couldn't make it.

17:27.320 --> 17:28.160
Bigger question.

17:28.240 --> 17:29.080
Where's the uke?

17:30.520 --> 17:32.040
Judges totally
underscored you.

17:32.120 --> 17:32.880
It's fine.

17:32.960 --> 17:34.760
You should get down
to the tag point.

17:36.400 --> 17:37.800
Sure, no worries.

17:41.680 --> 17:42.520
And hey,

17:44.160 --> 17:45.680
have fun out there.

17:50.160 --> 17:51.400
Nice save.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.320
I'm not sure

17:57.320 --> 17:59.280
where this Thommo Gibson
character has come from,

17:59.360 --> 18:02.200
but he is absolutely ripping.

18:02.960 --> 18:05.160
Oh, what's happening?

18:05.240 --> 18:07.920
Gibson chases
a clean section,

18:08.000 --> 18:10.640
gives himself some space,

18:10.720 --> 18:13.560
and a beautiful
comeback to finish.

18:14.520 --> 18:15.480
Whoa.

18:15.560 --> 18:17.320
I hope you suck
like that brother.

18:17.400 --> 18:18.560
So do I.

18:18.640 --> 18:19.920
After
a slow start,

18:20.000 --> 18:22.960
Shorehaven clawing their way
back into contention.

18:23.040 --> 18:26.160
Mercer only finding
time for one wave here,

18:26.240 --> 18:29.640
but she's chipped out
an absolute gem.

18:29.880 --> 18:32.600
Big smooth turns
on display here,

18:32.680 --> 18:36.600
and rising star, Ari Gibson,
keeps the momentum going.

18:36.680 --> 18:39.000
With the best two teams
in this heat progressing

18:39.080 --> 18:40.360
through to the next round,

18:40.480 --> 18:43.200
that scorching
ride by Gibson Jr

18:43.280 --> 18:45.560
gives Shorehaven
a real chance.

18:47.280 --> 18:49.760
Come on Marlon,
go, go, go. Come on.

18:49.840 --> 18:52.480
Go, go, go, go.

18:52.560 --> 18:55.880
Ari hey, that's
the way to surf, boy!

18:56.800 --> 18:58.280
Almost as good as
your dad, buddy.

18:58.360 --> 18:59.520
You're beautiful, mate.
Well done.

18:59.640 --> 19:00.640
Thanks, Dad.

19:01.720 --> 19:03.200
Anchor Cove's
Griff Temple

19:03.280 --> 19:06.440
making the most
of a tricky wave here.

19:06.520 --> 19:09.920
Oh, laser precision
in that top turn.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.960
And that's a 7.9
for Temple's last effort.

19:13.040 --> 19:14.800
Dying minutes of the heat here,

19:14.880 --> 19:17.280
and Sousa's struggling
to get a look in.

19:25.840 --> 19:27.760
Temple tries to
press his advantage,

19:27.840 --> 19:30.000
but Sousa beats him to it.

19:30.080 --> 19:31.200
Not a huge wave,

19:31.280 --> 19:34.480
but the Shorehaven
hot-shot goes for the air.

19:34.560 --> 19:35.560
Nails it.

19:35.640 --> 19:36.760
Incredible.

19:37.680 --> 19:40.800
So sick bro!
They had nothing.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.200
When you're hot,
you're hot, my brother.

19:43.280 --> 19:44.000
Okay, guys.

19:44.080 --> 19:45.880
Second round draw's
looking a bit easier.

19:45.960 --> 19:47.960
Making the final
is totally doable.

19:48.040 --> 19:49.720
Yeah, and if anyone has
a sore knee or anything,

19:49.800 --> 19:51.520
I'm more than happy to step in.

19:51.600 --> 19:52.560
Hey Pops.

19:52.640 --> 19:54.240
What do you want, Griff?

19:54.600 --> 19:57.480
I just wanted say I'm sorry your
mum's not here to see this.

19:57.560 --> 19:58.760
She was super cool.

20:00.080 --> 20:00.840
Hey thanks.

20:00.920 --> 20:03.000
And bro, when the oldies
at Anchor Cove

20:03.080 --> 20:06.840
take this long to make a
decision, it's usually a no,

20:06.920 --> 20:08.680
just in case you were
getting your hopes up.

20:12.720 --> 20:14.400
So I had a meeting with them.

20:14.480 --> 20:15.240
No biggie.

20:15.320 --> 20:16.160
No biggie?

20:16.240 --> 20:17.800
Ordinary move mate, ordinary.

20:17.880 --> 20:20.200
Yeah, why would you want to surf
with those garbage humans?

20:21.760 --> 20:23.880
More resources, more support.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.520
As if you guys
haven't thought about it.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.960
I've genuinely never
thought about it.

20:29.040 --> 20:30.480
Shorehaven is family.

20:30.560 --> 20:31.760
Where's your loyalty?

20:35.920 --> 20:37.440
Come on, let's go.

20:45.320 --> 20:46.680
Well after
an epic day,

20:46.760 --> 20:49.240
the final is a
round one rematch.

20:49.320 --> 20:52.200
Shorehaven facing the
mighty Anchor Cove,

20:52.280 --> 20:54.520
who are defending this crown
for the fifth year in a row.

20:54.640 --> 20:57.760
-Let's go, sis.
-Go, Poppy.

20:57.840 --> 21:00.680
-Go Shorehaven.
-Rock it.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.000
If you didn't feel supported,

21:02.080 --> 21:04.000
why didn't you talk
to me about it?

21:04.960 --> 21:05.800
Why would I?

21:07.480 --> 21:09.240
You didn't take me seriously.

21:09.400 --> 21:11.240
Now from where I'm standing,

21:12.440 --> 21:13.640
I think it's the
other way round.

21:14.560 --> 21:16.880
Whether Anchor Cove
take you or not,

21:16.960 --> 21:20.440
me and you, we're done.

21:21.560 --> 21:22.360
Bye.

21:38.320 --> 21:39.800
One good wave Pops,
that's all you need.

21:39.880 --> 21:41.120
One good wave.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.880
Let's go, Pops.
Get in there.

21:48.200 --> 21:49.960
It's gone
flat as a tack out there

21:50.040 --> 21:51.720
for Tetanui and Tran.

21:52.400 --> 21:55.080
Tetanui will be gagging
for redemption points,

21:55.160 --> 21:57.200
but time's ticking
on this round.

22:19.800 --> 22:20.640
What?

22:25.840 --> 22:27.720
Tetanui
is on fire.

22:27.800 --> 22:32.000
Look at her go through
the lip, back for more.

22:38.600 --> 22:40.280
Marlon's gone.

22:40.360 --> 22:41.760
What do you
mean he's gone?

22:41.840 --> 22:42.600
Ghosted.

22:42.680 --> 22:43.800
Yeah, and not
answering his phone.

22:43.880 --> 22:45.280
Maybe we went a
bit hard on him.

22:45.360 --> 22:46.160
Are you serious?

22:46.240 --> 22:48.120
There's so much more
I could have said.

22:49.600 --> 22:50.760
I'm going to do another lap.

22:50.840 --> 22:52.240
And you come with me, okay?

22:52.320 --> 22:55.480
And it's
an 8.2 for Shorehaven.

22:55.560 --> 22:57.160
We're only a couple
of points behind.

22:57.240 --> 22:58.680
I'll talk to the organisers.

22:58.760 --> 23:00.280
Maybe they'll let me surf twice.

23:00.400 --> 23:01.760
Pops, you know the rules.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.600
When someone drops out,
the sub surfs.

23:03.680 --> 23:04.560
Sub?

23:05.120 --> 23:06.160
You mean me?

23:06.240 --> 23:07.800
Bodhs, be real.

23:07.880 --> 23:10.800
It'd be Summer vs. Griff.
It's ridiculous.

23:10.880 --> 23:12.160
Okay, harsh.

23:12.240 --> 23:13.680
So when you need someone,
she's right there,

23:13.760 --> 23:15.800
but when you don't,
you just chuck her away?

23:15.880 --> 23:16.960
Okay.

23:18.040 --> 23:19.160
Okay, you good to go?

23:19.240 --> 23:20.480
Sure, if you want me to.

23:20.560 --> 23:21.360
Totally.

23:26.840 --> 23:28.360
Shorehaven
up-and-comer, Marlon Sousa,

23:28.440 --> 23:30.240
a no-show for the
final match up.

23:30.320 --> 23:32.080
With the 10 minutes nearly up,

23:32.160 --> 23:34.520
there's been very little
on offer here.

23:39.480 --> 23:40.880
You going to go?

23:40.960 --> 23:42.600
Just waiting for the right one.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.800
In a way, no waves
is good for Summer.

23:47.880 --> 23:50.240
Yeah but, if they both
get zero, we lose.

23:50.360 --> 23:52.800
Just over a
minute left in this final,

23:52.880 --> 23:55.040
can these competitors
make something happen?

23:56.200 --> 23:57.240
Here we go.

23:57.320 --> 23:59.120
At last a little ripple or two.

24:00.440 --> 24:01.920
And he takes it.

24:03.680 --> 24:06.880
Oh, it gives him
absolutely nothing.

24:06.960 --> 24:08.640
Was that the plan all along?

24:11.400 --> 24:12.960
She did it.
The fake out.

24:13.040 --> 24:13.960
I taught her that.

24:14.080 --> 24:16.280
Hey Griff doesn't have time
to catch another wave.

24:16.360 --> 24:18.160
Yeah, but she
still needs a 2.3.

24:18.680 --> 24:20.000
Summer can do that.

24:20.080 --> 24:20.880
Can she?

24:25.360 --> 24:29.440
-Come on, come on, come on.
-Come on, Summer.

24:30.840 --> 24:34.640
Last ditch effort
by Torres, and she's up.

24:34.720 --> 24:38.800
A little wobbly, but pulls
up a neat little turn.

24:38.880 --> 24:41.400
Yo, what was that?
That was, that was not nothing.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.000
That was something.

24:43.080 --> 24:44.560
That was definitely something.

24:44.640 --> 24:46.000
With
20 seconds to go,

24:46.080 --> 24:48.400
a disappointed Temple
crosses the line,

24:48.480 --> 24:50.680
not wanting to risk
a time penalty.

24:52.520 --> 24:54.520
And the judges have spoken.

24:54.600 --> 24:59.360
That is a 2.7 for Torres
putting Shorehaven in front.

25:00.240 --> 25:03.960
But she still has to cross
the line to seal the win.

25:03.960 --> 25:06.040
-Let's go.
-Summer, let's go.

25:07.160 --> 25:09.160
-Get up, get up.
-Come on, Summer.

25:09.240 --> 25:11.000
-Quick.
-Come on.

25:11.080 --> 25:12.800
Quick, quick, quick.
Get across the line.

25:12.960 --> 25:14.000
Five.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.320
Four.

25:15.400 --> 25:16.400
Three.

25:16.480 --> 25:17.280
Two.

25:17.360 --> 25:19.680
One.
And she has done it.

25:20.000 --> 25:24.200
She's done it for Shorehaven.
Amazing!
