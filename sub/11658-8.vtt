Now, ma, you're sure you'll be all right?

00:56.200 --> 00:59.266
-Dorothy, I'll be fine.
-Behave yourself.

00:59.333 --> 01:04.633
Don't use the car, no parties,
and stay out of the liquor cabinet.

01:05.233 --> 01:07.133
Hey, who am I, <i>Gidget?</i>
Get out of here.

01:08.500 --> 01:11.000
-Dorothy, you have the tickets?
-Yes, Rose.

01:11.066 --> 01:12.600
-And the passports?
-Yes, Rose.

01:12.667 --> 01:14.800
-Pepto-Bismol?
-Yes, Rose.

01:15.667 --> 01:17.333
-Dramamine?
-Yes, Rose.

01:17.400 --> 01:20.400
-Gum to pop our ears?
-Yes, Rose.

01:20.734 --> 01:24.066
-You called a cab?
-I called two.

01:24.133 --> 01:26.133
One for us and one for you

01:26.200 --> 01:29.100
'cause you're making me crazy
with all your questions.

01:29.166 --> 01:32.300
I'm sorry. International travel
just worries me.

01:32.367 --> 01:34.500
With all the problems
in the Middle East...

01:34.567 --> 01:39.300
We're going to a Caribbean island!
Our biggest worry is getting strap marks.

01:42.700 --> 01:46.200
Come on, now, Blanche!
You can't take all that luggage.

01:46.266 --> 01:50.100
Dorothy, I may run into a celebrity
while I'm sunbathing.

01:50.166 --> 01:53.533
I packed what I need to look devastating.

01:53.600 --> 01:55.333
Then I hope you packed a tight butt.

01:56.467 --> 01:58.300
(doorbell rings)

01:59.500 --> 02:00.867
Oh, yes.

02:00.934 --> 02:05.000
-Is this cab yours or mine?
-Rose, there's one cab.

02:05.066 --> 02:09.066
-Well, how will I get there?
-Run behind it!

02:11.233 --> 02:14.734
Ma, I hate leaving you like this.
Why not come along?

02:14.800 --> 02:19.133
-Yeah, Sophia, it'll be fun.
-And the resort is absolutely gorgeous.

02:19.200 --> 02:23.233
Here's our room. You can have
the king-sized bed.

02:23.300 --> 02:24.734
There's already two people in it.

02:26.667 --> 02:27.667
Ma, please.

02:27.734 --> 02:30.600
Otherwise, I'll spend my vacation
worrying about you.

02:30.667 --> 02:34.867
I'll like having the house to myself.
I can vacuum in the nude.

02:34.934 --> 02:36.133
Now get going.

02:37.467 --> 02:38.867
Take care, Sophia.

02:39.133 --> 02:41.266
I'll call you the minute
I get to the hotel.

02:49.133 --> 02:50.333
Mr. Mitsumo!

02:51.100 --> 02:53.100
Hi, Mr. Mitsumo.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Uh...

02:57.367 --> 03:00.700
I've been meaning to tell you,
you did wonderfully with the snails.

03:01.100 --> 03:03.800
It's nice not crunching my way
to the mailbox.

03:05.333 --> 03:07.700
So, did I mention that my daughter
and her roommates

03:07.767 --> 03:10.867
will be vacationing for five days?

03:12.100 --> 03:13.967
Anyway, I notice, um...

03:14.533 --> 03:17.700
we're always smiling at each other,
so I was thinking,

03:17.767 --> 03:21.800
now that we have some privacy,
maybe we could smile and talk...

03:21.867 --> 03:24.467
you know, over a glass of tang
or something.

03:24.533 --> 03:25.800
Oh, tang.

03:26.467 --> 03:28.333
Tang is not the catchword here.

03:29.967 --> 03:33.900
What I mean is,
I thought we kind of liked each other,

03:33.967 --> 03:35.300
you and me.

03:36.667 --> 03:39.734
This is very embarrassing.
You don't understand a word I'm saying.

03:45.800 --> 03:48.734
-Understand little.
-Oh...

04:05.834 --> 04:08.166
you can put the luggage right, uh...

04:12.400 --> 04:14.200
There would be fine, too.

04:15.567 --> 04:19.200
Girls, this room looks
nothing like the pictures in the brochure.

04:19.266 --> 04:23.467
-Oh, this room isn't good enough for you?
-Not for $100 a night.

04:23.533 --> 04:26.633
Americans measure everything
by the dollar.

04:26.700 --> 04:30.000
We're trying to learn metric.
It's not that easy.

04:31.900 --> 04:33.934
This place is like a sweatbox.

04:34.633 --> 04:36.800
Great, the air conditioner's
not working.

04:36.867 --> 04:41.333
Who needs it? We have a fresh ocean breeze
and a breathtaking view.

04:45.266 --> 04:47.000
We have no view.

04:49.300 --> 04:50.300
Oh...

04:51.333 --> 04:56.667
When the revolution comes and imperialist
heads are impaled on sticks in the sand

04:56.734 --> 04:58.033
for people to spit on,

04:58.100 --> 05:00.100
you'll be glad you don't got a view.

05:03.600 --> 05:06.767
This isn't solving anything.
I'm calling the manager.

05:08.100 --> 05:09.100
Hello?

05:10.934 --> 05:13.200
Hello? Great, the phone's dead.

05:13.266 --> 05:17.000
Makes no difference.
You'll get lies from that pig.

05:18.467 --> 05:22.600
Look, would you mind going down
and telling the pig we wanna see him?

05:23.200 --> 05:25.467
Ok, but his days are numbered.

05:25.734 --> 05:28.934
When the revolution comes,
he's the second to be shot.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.133
Who's the first?

05:30.200 --> 05:32.934
Morales, my next-door neighbor
who knocked up my sister.

05:38.567 --> 05:41.300
Well, this is dandy, just dandy!

05:41.867 --> 05:46.033
I should never have let you
talk me into this.

05:46.100 --> 05:50.467
Come off it, Blanche.
We all agreed on this place.

05:50.533 --> 05:53.500
All I wanted was to tan my thighs.

05:54.166 --> 05:57.066
Now I'll probably end up a prisoner
of the revolution.

05:57.533 --> 06:01.000
They'll rip my blouse
and make me cook for the officers,

06:01.066 --> 06:04.500
spit food in my face,
make fun of my recipes.

06:05.433 --> 06:08.467
Eventually, I'll catch the eye
of some fat general

06:08.533 --> 06:11.200
with sweat stains under his arms...

06:12.100 --> 06:16.867
and I'll be forced to let out his uniforms
and satisfy his ugly needs.

06:18.967 --> 06:21.233
That sounds like
Christmas with my ex-husband.

06:23.033 --> 06:27.500
Why are you two complaining?
I'll suffer most from this.

06:27.834 --> 06:32.667
I'll get all wilted and sweaty.
No man will even talk to me.

06:32.734 --> 06:35.433
And how can I date
without a telephone?

06:35.500 --> 06:38.900
The way you always do.
Go sit in the bar without underwear.

06:41.834 --> 06:42.834
Good evening.

06:42.900 --> 06:45.934
I'm Jacques de Courville,
manager of the Rustling Palms

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
-and reigning island limbo king.
-Oh, please, come in.

06:49.066 --> 06:51.700
I'm in. What's the problem here?

06:51.767 --> 06:57.967
Well, to begin with, in here,
it says every room has an ocean view.

06:58.233 --> 07:00.767
-Now, where is ours?
-Come on. Give me the thing.

07:00.834 --> 07:02.233
Come here, kiddo.

07:03.433 --> 07:06.400
Stick your head out the window,
look to the extreme left,

07:06.467 --> 07:08.000
and what do you see?

07:09.200 --> 07:11.266
Two guys beating up an old lady.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.333
Beyond that.

07:15.967 --> 07:18.700
-The ocean?
-Ta-da! I rest my case.

07:18.767 --> 07:23.133
Now wait, wait.
You have to be a contortionist to see.

07:23.200 --> 07:26.467
Hey, it doesn't say great ocean view.

07:26.800 --> 07:29.633
Now look. These accommodations
are simply unacceptable.

07:29.700 --> 07:34.400
We want the room described
in the brochure, or we'll go elsewhere.

07:34.467 --> 07:36.533

07:45.633 --> 07:50.233
I'm sorry, but my travel agent said
prepaying would be easier.

07:50.300 --> 07:52.867
-Believe me, it is.
-Now what?

07:52.934 --> 07:55.900
We have no choice.
We have to stay.

07:55.967 --> 08:00.266
Oh, goody. You need anything day or night,
you call me.

08:00.333 --> 08:02.300
We can't. The phone's dead.

08:02.367 --> 08:05.500
Well, there's plenty of stationery.
Write me.

08:07.467 --> 08:09.767
I'm starting to root for the revolution.

08:10.467 --> 08:12.800
Well, we're here now.

08:12.867 --> 08:16.000
-Come on, let's make the best of it.
-Maybe it's not a total loss.

08:16.066 --> 08:18.533
Look, a vibrating bed.
Let's give it a try.

08:18.600 --> 08:22.800
-Blanche...
-Come on, it'll be fun.

08:22.867 --> 08:23.900
Sure.

08:24.166 --> 08:25.467

08:59.333 --> 09:01.100
It's been great, Toshiro.

09:01.600 --> 09:04.266
And driving your lawn-boy
was so exciting.

09:06.033 --> 09:07.600
Eat. Eat.

09:08.500 --> 09:11.500
Amazing. You eat with sticks,
you never miss a bite.

09:11.567 --> 09:15.400
We use a fork, spoon, and bread
and drop half.

09:16.433 --> 09:17.834

09:18.800 --> 09:21.734
Uh, so, exactly...

09:21.800 --> 09:23.400
exactly what is this stuff?

09:23.734 --> 09:28.000
Is sushi. Raw fish. Very good.

09:31.500 --> 09:33.433
Whoops! That flew right out of my hand.

09:40.900 --> 09:42.200
Mmm...

09:42.600 --> 09:43.734
that was delicious.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.166
I couldn't eat another bite.

09:46.867 --> 09:48.000
I got to tell you.

09:48.467 --> 09:52.200
Even though you eat raw fish
and like listening to a piano being tuned,

09:52.266 --> 09:54.166
I find you awfully cute.

09:55.633 --> 09:57.100
Sophia cuter.

10:08.967 --> 10:11.533
What is all that stuff?

10:11.600 --> 10:13.433
My natural beauty supplements.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.367
My apricot facial scrub,

10:15.433 --> 10:18.567
my honey skin toner
and my coconut moisturizer.

10:19.133 --> 10:22.467
If I put cracked ice and an umbrella
on your head, you'd be a mai tai.

10:26.900 --> 10:27.900
Ooh.

10:30.467 --> 10:32.600
I wish we had packed a bug spray.

10:33.066 --> 10:35.967
Girls, I've got our whole
day planned tomorrow.

10:36.367 --> 10:39.200
We're going out on
a glass-bottomed boat.

10:39.500 --> 10:42.767
At 10:00, we'll tour
an old Spanish fort.

10:43.266 --> 10:47.166
At 3:00, we'll visit the wreck
of the <i>Santa Juanita,</i>

10:47.233 --> 10:52.500
then we'll finish the day
with a sunset hike up a dormant volcano.

10:58.467 --> 11:00.367
All right, forget the volcano.

11:00.900 --> 11:04.333
No, I just killed
a mosquito on your cheek.

11:06.233 --> 11:08.266
Thank you very much, Dorothy.

11:08.834 --> 11:13.266
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll go wash
the squashed bug off my face.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.467
Just a minute. Won't be very long.

11:18.934 --> 11:20.633
Okey-dokey, take your time.

11:21.033 --> 11:23.834
-There's somebody in the bathroom.
-He said he wouldn't be long...

11:27.734 --> 11:29.400
Don't rush me.

11:29.467 --> 11:31.266
It's going to take as long as
it's going to take.

11:32.166 --> 11:35.166
I don't believe this.
There's a man in there.

11:35.433 --> 11:37.200
Relax. Let me handle this.

11:38.800 --> 11:41.700
Hello there. Excuse me, sir.
Are you married?

11:42.700 --> 11:44.100
No, actually, I'm not.

11:44.166 --> 11:50.166
I hope one day you meet miss right,
but in the meantime, who are you?

11:50.233 --> 11:51.800
-I'm Dwayne, and that's Rick.
-Hi.

11:51.867 --> 11:53.800
And I'm Winston Hardwick III.

11:56.533 --> 11:59.800
It's nice meeting you,
but why are you in our bathroom?

11:59.867 --> 12:04.533
I'm afraid the six of us
will have to share this bathroom.

12:04.900 --> 12:07.600
I'm not sharing with
three strange men.

12:07.667 --> 12:09.800
I don't care if it is my vacation.

12:12.166 --> 12:15.500
No choice, lady.
There aren't enough Johns.

12:15.567 --> 12:16.967
Oh, this is ridiculous.

12:17.033 --> 12:21.600
Think we like gargling next to grandma
Moses and the Mosettes?

12:24.433 --> 12:26.433
You...you...

12:26.500 --> 12:28.700
you rude person.

12:31.133 --> 12:32.734
Go easy on him, Rose.

12:35.133 --> 12:40.033
Ladies, as long as we're stuck together,
here's some friendly advice...

12:40.100 --> 12:41.166
-buzz off.
-Beat it.

12:41.233 --> 12:42.266
Yeah, scram.

12:43.734 --> 12:45.066
Look, kid...

12:46.100 --> 12:47.667
you can just kiss my patootie.

12:47.734 --> 12:51.967
This is our John, and if you have to go,
the jungle's thataway.

12:52.367 --> 12:53.500
Come on, ladies.

13:03.367 --> 13:05.400
The meal was disgusting.

13:07.166 --> 13:08.834
What do you girls want to do now?

13:08.900 --> 13:12.033
Let's draw cards
for the rest of the Pepto-Bismol.

13:13.867 --> 13:15.567
Oh, no. It's those nasty boys.

13:16.100 --> 13:20.834
Ladies, my friends and I
would like to buy you drinks.

13:20.900 --> 13:22.867
-Why, thank you.
-Blanche!

13:22.934 --> 13:27.000
I'm sorry... reflex reaction.
No, thank you and goodbye.

13:27.867 --> 13:33.000
We've thought about what we said last
night, and we're real sorry.

13:33.333 --> 13:36.166
Must have been quite a shock
finding us in your bathroom, huh?

13:36.867 --> 13:39.100
Won't you please accept our apologies?

13:40.967 --> 13:43.266
-All right. Apology accepted.
-Great.

13:43.333 --> 13:44.734
Buy us that drink.

13:45.033 --> 13:47.300
Waitress, a magnum
of your best champagne.

13:48.100 --> 13:51.500
So, uh... how you ladies
been enjoying your vacation?

13:51.567 --> 13:56.033
As a child during the depression,
I had to have my wisdom teeth extracted

13:56.100 --> 13:57.266
by a shoemaker.

13:58.333 --> 14:00.233
That was more fun than this.

14:01.700 --> 14:04.967
Ladies, let's face it.
The island's a bore.

14:05.033 --> 14:08.533
However, I happen to have access
to a sailboat tonight.

14:08.600 --> 14:10.967
Could we interest you
in an evening cruise?

14:11.033 --> 14:13.767
-Oh, I'm game. Girls?
-Sounds fun.

14:13.834 --> 14:14.834
Why not?

14:14.900 --> 14:17.767
We'll meet you back here
in 45 minutes.

14:17.834 --> 14:20.233
Perfect. Enough time to call my mother.

14:21.800 --> 14:23.367
Your mother's still living?

14:26.867 --> 14:27.934
I'm sorry.

14:34.767 --> 14:37.133
Now try the veal piccata. You'll weep.

14:39.967 --> 14:43.266
Mmm. Sophia very sweet.

14:44.033 --> 14:46.567
Toshiro, can I make a confession?

14:47.200 --> 14:48.734
You bring out the beast in me.

14:50.900 --> 14:54.233
I know, you look at me, you think,
"there's a chick who gets around."

14:55.900 --> 14:59.967
But that's not true. Until I met you,
I didn't know I still had those feelings.

15:01.033 --> 15:03.266
You made me realize
there's a lot of wisdom

15:03.333 --> 15:05.767
in what the Sicilians say
about the old olive tree.

15:06.200 --> 15:09.867
"Although and it's ancient and all
and not much to look at...

15:10.166 --> 15:13.367
it still has the tastiest,
plumpest olives."

15:13.800 --> 15:15.133
How about an olive?

15:17.300 --> 15:18.300
Olive?

15:20.800 --> 15:24.233
Look, I realize you don't understand most
of this, but that's ok.

15:24.300 --> 15:27.433
I was married 45 years.
My husband spoke perfect English.

15:27.500 --> 15:29.433
Never understood a word I said.

15:33.467 --> 15:38.033
Uh... Toshiro, I think it's time you
learned some English.

15:39.500 --> 15:42.100
Lesson number one... kiss.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.934
(telephone rings)

15:48.000 --> 15:49.200
Who the hell is this?

15:52.066 --> 15:53.800
Dorothy, nice to hear from you.

15:54.233 --> 15:55.367
How's the vacation?

15:55.433 --> 15:57.800
Good. Well, nothing's happening here.
Take care.

16:05.367 --> 16:07.333
Lesson number one... kiss.

16:10.767 --> 16:13.100
Oh, beautiful Mother Earth!

16:13.400 --> 16:18.633
-Land, land! Thank God!
-How long were we out there?

16:18.700 --> 16:21.066
Oh, at least two rosaries.

16:21.133 --> 16:22.533
We're lucky to be alive.

16:22.600 --> 16:27.100
And you, you miserable,
low-down piece of Yankee slime.

16:28.066 --> 16:30.667
I sense some hostility towards me.

16:30.734 --> 16:33.533
How'd you like to sense
a coconut upside your head?

16:34.934 --> 16:37.867
-Get ahold of yourself.
-Get ahold of myself?

16:37.934 --> 16:42.100
They sail us into the middle of a storm.

16:42.166 --> 16:45.800
We end up shipwrecked
on this God-forsaken island.

16:45.867 --> 16:48.667
We made a mistake.
Nobody's perfect.

16:48.734 --> 16:54.266
-What's the big deal?
-You almost killed us, you nitwits.

16:54.333 --> 16:55.734
I hate you.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.667
I curse the day I laid eyes on you.

16:58.734 --> 17:01.233
I curse the day your parents met.

17:01.500 --> 17:04.367
I curse the day your parents
laid down together.

17:05.734 --> 17:09.300
You ladies should be grateful.
It was our superior sailing skill

17:09.367 --> 17:11.033
that saved your lives.

17:11.100 --> 17:14.934
Hanging on to the mast and screaming,
"Please, God, take the old ladies,

17:15.033 --> 17:16.233
but don't hurt us..."

17:17.734 --> 17:19.767
that doesn't qualify as skill.

17:19.834 --> 17:23.433
We've taken all the guff
we're taking off you.

17:23.500 --> 17:26.700
No, you're taking all the guff I got.

17:26.767 --> 17:29.467
All right, everybody!
Now shut the hell up!

17:31.333 --> 17:34.333
I'm in charge here.
Everyone listens to me.

17:34.400 --> 17:35.500
Why you?

17:35.567 --> 17:38.867
Because I'm the most decorated
pioneer scout

17:38.934 --> 17:40.700
in the history of northern Minnesota.

17:41.800 --> 17:45.533
I can build a 100-foot rope bridge,
start a fire with rocks,

17:45.600 --> 17:47.500
distill seawater into drinking water.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.834
If you want out alive, you listen to me.

17:50.900 --> 17:52.200
Do I hear any objections?

17:53.300 --> 17:55.767
I didn't think so.

17:56.567 --> 17:59.600
Dorothy, Blanche, start breaking up
the boat. We need firewood.

17:59.667 --> 18:01.767
You three head up that ridge.

18:01.834 --> 18:05.000
There's a good chance
of finding a waterfall.

18:05.066 --> 18:08.867
After an hour,
follow the coastline around

18:08.934 --> 18:10.400
and look for our fire. Now move.

18:11.166 --> 18:12.200
I said move!

18:16.934 --> 18:19.300
Should we be listening to Rose?

18:19.367 --> 18:22.166
Quiet. We're not allowed to talk
while we work.

18:32.367 --> 18:33.500
How long they been gone?

18:34.967 --> 18:36.367
Over four hours.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.633
Think anything happened to them?

18:39.700 --> 18:41.867
I think they probably
just stopped to rest.

18:41.934 --> 18:44.767
Yeah, or maybe they're looking
for water containers.

18:44.834 --> 18:47.767
Maybe they were clawed to death
by bloodthirsty animals.

18:49.533 --> 18:53.333
Unfortunately, water isn't all that can be
around that formation.

18:53.400 --> 18:54.633
You're kidding.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.633
Pioneer scouts always tell the truth.

18:59.100 --> 19:01.100
So I'll be more honest.

19:01.500 --> 19:05.700
Our big worry is nobody knows we're
missing, so nobody's looking for us.

19:06.266 --> 19:12.266
-The odds are pretty decent we'll all die.
-Oh, Rose. Come on now.

19:12.333 --> 19:15.633
-You're just tired and thirsty.
-Yeah, we're all tired and thirsty.

19:15.700 --> 19:17.266
Let's not wait.

19:17.333 --> 19:21.400
Rose, make us a batch
of fresh water from seawater.

19:21.467 --> 19:25.033
-Um... about the seawater--
-You can't do it?

19:25.100 --> 19:27.433
-I can.
-Thank goodness.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.200
There's just one little problem.

19:29.533 --> 19:33.767
I need a 10-gallon copper pot,
7 feet of aluminum tubing,

19:33.834 --> 19:35.800
and a roll of cheesecloth.

19:36.266 --> 19:37.867
Why didn't you mention this

19:37.934 --> 19:41.033
while you were bossing everybody around,
miss pioneer dope?

19:43.200 --> 19:46.233
Things were going so well and everybody
was paying such close attention.

19:46.500 --> 19:48.667
I just got caught up in the moment.

19:49.767 --> 19:51.500
It's lonely at the top.

19:52.400 --> 19:55.166
I don't want to be leader anymore.
I nominate Dorothy.

19:55.233 --> 19:56.767
You're leader. What will you do?

19:57.767 --> 20:00.967
My first official act
is to banish you from my kingdom.

20:03.500 --> 20:06.700
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
I know you meant well.

20:07.400 --> 20:09.433
I'm not crying because of that.

20:09.500 --> 20:14.266
We're going to die,
and I still have so much to tell you.

20:14.333 --> 20:15.567
-Like what?
-Like...

20:16.700 --> 20:18.433
once I read your diary.

20:21.300 --> 20:22.367
You what?

20:22.433 --> 20:27.834
You left it open on the table.
I read 20 pages before I realized

20:27.900 --> 20:30.166
it wasn't a Sidney Sheldon novel.

20:32.467 --> 20:35.400
Rose, I want you out of my house
this instant.

20:36.033 --> 20:37.266
Uh, Blanche.

20:38.700 --> 20:42.300
I'll never speak to you as long as I live.

20:42.367 --> 20:46.767
Since we have no water,
that means about another 48 hours.

20:48.066 --> 20:51.967
Since we're going to die anyway,
I might as well be honest, too, Rose.

20:52.967 --> 20:57.266
I slept with your cross-eyed cousin Nolan
when he visited us from Ohio.

21:00.266 --> 21:01.667
And he was lousy in bed.

21:03.433 --> 21:06.934
I knew about that a long time ago.
Nolan told me.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.300
He said you were the one
that was lousy.

21:11.967 --> 21:13.200
-Take that back.
-Won't.

21:13.266 --> 21:15.200
-Will!
-Girls, girls.

21:15.266 --> 21:19.867
Let's examine our priorities.
There's no food, water or shelter.

21:20.567 --> 21:24.166
Besides, I also slept with Nolan
on that fateful trip.

21:25.967 --> 21:30.533
And as your leader, I must decree
that the fault indeed lies with Nolan.

21:35.400 --> 21:39.166
Well... since we're being honest, Dorothy,
I have a question for you.

21:40.700 --> 21:42.100
You're supposed to be my best friend.

21:42.166 --> 21:44.767
Best friends should be able to confide
in one another.

21:45.333 --> 21:50.400
Why did I overhear you telling Anita
Rubaker I had my tubes tied?

21:52.300 --> 21:55.867
I said you "bought a tube top."
When were your tubes tied?

21:55.934 --> 21:59.433
They weren't. But it would have been
about the same time

21:59.500 --> 22:00.834
you had your nose done.

22:01.500 --> 22:05.233
I never had my nose done.
Rose is the one with the nose job.

22:05.300 --> 22:07.567
Oops. Sorry, Rose.

22:09.667 --> 22:12.734
I don't believe you two kept that
secret from me.

22:12.800 --> 22:14.433
Rose, why didn't you tell me?

22:14.500 --> 22:17.133
You're so critical about those things.

22:17.200 --> 22:20.300
I am not. How much?

22:20.367 --> 22:22.600
-$700.
-Boy, you were gypped.

22:24.367 --> 22:27.934
See? That's exactly why Rose
didn't want to tell you.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.266
You are overly critical.

22:29.333 --> 22:35.000
-That's the thing I like least about you.
-You are loud and overbearing.

22:35.066 --> 22:38.967
You're both always telling me what to do.

22:39.033 --> 22:40.033
(both) Shut up, Rose!

22:49.467 --> 22:52.133
Will somebody say I'm sorry
before I burst?

22:52.200 --> 22:55.600
-I'm sorry.
-If I have to die,

22:55.667 --> 22:57.734
I'm just glad
I'm with my two best friends.

22:57.800 --> 23:01.600
-I love you, Blanche.
-I love you both.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.633
I'm so full of love,
I have to let it out.

-Where have you been?

23:23.233 --> 23:26.066
Rose was right about the waterfall
in that rock formation.

23:26.133 --> 23:28.133
You were right, there is a waterfall.

23:28.200 --> 23:32.266
It empties into the pool
in the lobby of the Hyatt Regency!

23:32.800 --> 23:34.333
We never left the island.

23:34.400 --> 23:37.033
We got shipwrecked on the good side.

23:37.100 --> 23:39.567
Our new hotel is 1/2 mile in this
direction.

23:39.633 --> 23:41.233
We reserved you a room.

23:41.300 --> 23:43.100
Rick, put out the fire!

23:44.400 --> 23:49.533
Since we're not going to die,
I suggest everything we said tonight

23:49.600 --> 23:51.066
won't go further than the three of us.

23:51.133 --> 23:53.367
We used to make it official

23:53.433 --> 23:56.633
by pricking our fingers
and taking a blood oath.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.066
What do you say?

23:58.133 --> 23:59.367
-Shut up, Rose.
-Shut up, Rose.
