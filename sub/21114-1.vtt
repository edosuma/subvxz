01:16.452 --> 01:17.870
The white ones, please.

01:17.953 --> 01:19.205
Twenty pfennig.

01:24.794 --> 01:25.419
Thank you.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.713
Pretty girl.

02:49.378 --> 02:50.629
Excuse me.

02:51.297 --> 02:53.841
Do you know who put flowers on that grave?

02:53.924 --> 02:55.134
Which one?

02:56.135 --> 02:58.179
Frantz Hoffmeister.

02:59.346 --> 03:00.431
Right.

03:02.224 --> 03:04.602
Must've been the foreigner.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.312
Where is he from?

03:09.481 --> 03:11.525
A French coin.

03:35.132 --> 03:37.176
He left flowers on the grave?

03:37.927 --> 03:38.928
Roses.

03:41.430 --> 03:43.390
Do you know who he could be?

03:45.351 --> 03:49.021
Maybe a French friend from before the war.

03:51.398 --> 03:52.983
Don't mention it to Hans.

03:58.155 --> 03:59.698
How is he doing?

04:01.533 --> 04:04.119
He hasn't left his office.

04:05.663 --> 04:07.122
It's hard for him.

04:09.500 --> 04:11.252
For all of us.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.714
Does it still hurt?

04:15.798 --> 04:19.343
In the evenings,
when I've walked too much.

04:20.094 --> 04:22.137
You will dance again.

04:23.097 --> 04:25.724
The French didn't get your leg.

04:25.808 --> 04:27.101
Thank you, Doctor.

04:28.143 --> 04:31.772
We haven't seen you
at our meetings for months.

04:33.899 --> 04:35.567
I love Germany.

04:36.277 --> 04:38.529
But I love my son more.

04:40.572 --> 04:41.907
I understand.

04:42.825 --> 04:45.369
But must we accept defeat?

04:45.452 --> 04:46.954
Humiliation?

04:47.788 --> 04:50.416
You share our desire
for a strong, powerful nation...

04:50.499 --> 04:54.962
You're here for your leg, Mr. Kreutz.

04:57.840 --> 05:01.593
Continue the treatment for a week.
That should do it.

05:03.220 --> 05:06.557
There's something else
I wanted to speak to you about.

05:09.685 --> 05:11.020
It's Anna.

05:12.062 --> 05:13.063
Anna?

05:14.565 --> 05:19.278
I know she has no family
and loves you like a father.

05:20.779 --> 05:23.407
I know she was engaged to your son...

05:24.241 --> 05:26.535
but I'd like to ask for her hand.

05:28.370 --> 05:29.913
Does she love you?

05:31.206 --> 05:32.666
She will.

05:38.589 --> 05:40.549
Mr. Kreutz wants to speak to you.

05:41.759 --> 05:42.760
Me?

05:47.097 --> 05:48.265
Come in.

05:50.768 --> 05:51.810
Good day.

05:51.894 --> 05:53.437
Good day, Anna.

05:53.520 --> 05:54.938
Have a seat.

05:59.902 --> 06:01.570
How are your studies?

06:05.240 --> 06:06.825
I quit.

06:06.909 --> 06:08.285
What a shame.

06:09.495 --> 06:11.330
I've lost the will.

06:14.750 --> 06:17.836
We've all lost loved ones.

06:19.213 --> 06:20.839
But we must go on living.

06:21.340 --> 06:22.716
We must rebuild.

06:23.967 --> 06:24.968
Yes.

06:26.095 --> 06:28.889
That's what Frantz wrote me
in his last letter.

06:32.476 --> 06:34.228
I know how you feel.

06:35.687 --> 06:37.439
You wouldn't be here if you did.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.736
I can help you forget Frantz.

06:46.865 --> 06:48.992
I don't want to forget him.

06:50.953 --> 06:52.704
How were your patients?

06:54.039 --> 06:55.749
The usual colds.

06:57.459 --> 06:59.128
It's springtime.

07:01.964 --> 07:04.425
Will you go to the ball Saturday?

07:04.508 --> 07:05.509
No.

07:06.593 --> 07:09.430
They've got new dresses in town.

07:09.513 --> 07:11.056
Who would I go with?

07:12.641 --> 07:14.101
Mr. Kreutz.

07:16.854 --> 07:18.605
He wants you to be happy.

07:21.024 --> 07:22.443
Who could that be?

07:23.610 --> 07:25.654
A patient, at this hour?

08:54.034 --> 08:55.202
Come in.

09:04.836 --> 09:05.921
Your name?

09:07.798 --> 09:08.924
Rivoire.

09:09.508 --> 09:11.051
Adrien Rivoire.

09:11.134 --> 09:12.553
You're not from here?

09:12.636 --> 09:13.637
No.

09:15.013 --> 09:16.306
Where are you from?

09:17.808 --> 09:18.642
Paris.

09:24.439 --> 09:25.566
You're French?

09:26.024 --> 09:27.025
Yes.

09:29.987 --> 09:33.240
I'm sorry. I can't treat you.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.701
Doctor, I must speak to you.

09:36.660 --> 09:37.828
Please go.

09:38.328 --> 09:39.955
I'm not ill, I wanted...

09:40.038 --> 09:41.081
Enough!

09:46.086 --> 09:50.132
Every Frenchman is my son's murderer.

09:53.468 --> 09:55.012
Please leave.

10:05.147 --> 10:07.274
You're right, Doctor.

10:08.525 --> 10:09.693
I was a soldier too.

10:10.902 --> 10:12.404
And I am a murderer too.

10:40.015 --> 10:41.850
Maybe in Frantz's room.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.368
What did the Frenchman say?

11:02.454 --> 11:04.247
You know him?

11:04.331 --> 11:05.749
No.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.626
I saw him at the cemetery.

11:08.835 --> 11:09.920
At the cemetery?

11:10.003 --> 11:13.507
He's come to Frantz's grave
the past two days.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.926
This morning he was crying.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.970
What did he say to you?

11:23.809 --> 11:24.851
Nothing.

11:26.478 --> 11:28.355
I refused to treat him.

11:30.816 --> 11:32.067
But Hans!

11:32.526 --> 11:35.028
He must be a friend of Frantz's.

11:35.112 --> 11:37.280
Someone he knew in Paris.

11:52.337 --> 11:56.133
Tell me, is this person staying here?

11:58.593 --> 12:00.804
I'm sorry, he's out.

12:07.144 --> 12:09.146
Looking for someone?

12:09.229 --> 12:10.230
Surely it's me.

12:10.313 --> 12:11.314
No.

12:12.065 --> 12:15.819
- Will you see that he gets it?
- Consider it done.

12:16.862 --> 12:19.781
I know I upset you yesterday.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.659
But will you let me take you to the ball?

12:23.452 --> 12:25.746
Dr. Hoffmeister is not opposed.

12:26.872 --> 12:29.082
I haven't got the heart to dance.

12:29.499 --> 12:31.001
Good-bye, Mr. Kreutz.

12:35.005 --> 12:36.631
Who's the letter for?

12:37.632 --> 12:39.009
The Frenchman.

12:40.552 --> 12:42.471
Are you sure he'll come?

12:43.597 --> 12:44.639
I hope so.

12:45.849 --> 12:49.561
If only Hans hadn't sent him away.

12:52.981 --> 12:54.608
Will Hans come down?

12:56.109 --> 12:57.402
I hope so.

12:59.988 --> 13:01.364
My God, he's here!

13:10.749 --> 13:11.917
Welcome.

13:17.798 --> 13:19.758
I am Frantz's mother.

13:20.425 --> 13:21.718
Good evening.

13:22.803 --> 13:25.347
This is Anna. She's like a daughter to us.

13:25.806 --> 13:27.641
Frantz's fiancée.

13:28.225 --> 13:29.226
Good evening.

13:30.894 --> 13:33.104
I saw you at the cemetery.

13:33.605 --> 13:35.607
I left the note at the hotel.

13:36.942 --> 13:37.984
May I?

13:38.068 --> 13:39.194
Your coat.

13:50.121 --> 13:51.665
This is my husband.

13:52.916 --> 13:55.502
You've already met.

13:58.213 --> 13:59.256
Good evening.

14:02.425 --> 14:03.677
Please come in.

14:10.976 --> 14:12.143
Have a seat.

14:12.686 --> 14:15.063
You have so much to tell us.

14:23.321 --> 14:24.573
How old are you?

14:26.658 --> 14:27.951
Twenty-four.

14:28.577 --> 14:31.496
Frantz would have been 24 in February.

14:32.455 --> 14:33.498
You speak German well.

14:35.333 --> 14:36.376
I get by.

14:36.459 --> 14:38.211
You knew Frantz?

14:40.505 --> 14:41.506
Yes.

14:43.633 --> 14:44.926
You met in France?

14:47.345 --> 14:48.430
Yes.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.683
During his last trip there?

15:00.859 --> 15:01.902
Pardon me.

15:07.157 --> 15:12.787
Thank you for your tears
and for your flowers on his grave.

15:13.955 --> 15:18.001
We're very touched
to speak with a friend of his

15:18.084 --> 15:22.297
who knew him well and remembers him.

15:23.214 --> 15:26.009
I'm not saying that
because I'm his mother.

15:26.968 --> 15:28.219
Anna too.

15:29.512 --> 15:31.473
We were to be married this autumn.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.684
His favorite season.

15:36.019 --> 15:40.065
Verlaine wrote a poem about autumn.
Frantz taught it to me.

15:40.982 --> 15:42.192
In French.

15:48.406 --> 15:52.577
We understand
how hard it must be to talk about him.

15:53.954 --> 15:55.872
How hard it must be...

15:56.831 --> 15:59.250
to meet his family.

16:03.254 --> 16:05.215
So you think of him always?

16:11.972 --> 16:13.890
And you'll never forget him?

16:14.766 --> 16:16.351
How could I?

16:25.026 --> 16:26.736
Please forgive my husband.

16:26.820 --> 16:29.072
He loved Frantz so much.

16:29.155 --> 16:31.074
He was our only son.

16:32.075 --> 16:34.577
He wishes he could have died instead.

16:36.079 --> 16:37.080
So do I.

16:41.001 --> 16:44.796
Would you tell us how you two met?

16:46.297 --> 16:47.966
The first time.

16:48.049 --> 16:50.593
And the last time?

16:51.636 --> 16:54.139
How was he the last time?

16:56.141 --> 16:57.475
The last time?

17:00.228 --> 17:04.273
The last time I saw him...

17:04.357 --> 17:05.692
Was he happy?

17:06.526 --> 17:07.986
“Glücklich”...

17:08.069 --> 17:09.194
Happy.

17:10.070 --> 17:12.449
Was it in Paris?

17:13.366 --> 17:14.284
Before the war?

17:20.123 --> 17:21.124
Yes.

17:23.167 --> 17:24.544
It was in Paris.

17:27.839 --> 17:30.133
I picked him up at his hotel...

17:32.218 --> 17:34.929
and we went to the Louvre.

17:36.681 --> 17:37.849
Two friends.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.562
It was a beautiful day.

17:45.273 --> 17:48.359
He enjoyed seeing the paintings.

17:49.069 --> 17:50.278
And so did I.

17:54.115 --> 17:57.243
We spent some time
looking at Manet's paintings.

18:01.039 --> 18:03.458
I remember...

18:04.667 --> 18:08.630
I remember there was one
he particularly liked.

18:10.507 --> 18:14.344
The one of a pale young man...

18:16.096 --> 18:18.014
with his head thrown back.

19:34.382 --> 19:38.386
Tonight it felt like Frantz was back home.

19:40.263 --> 19:41.973
God bless you.

19:42.473 --> 19:43.641
Thank you.

19:51.024 --> 19:52.567
Thank you for tonight.

19:55.028 --> 19:57.197
You brought them some comfort.

19:59.324 --> 20:00.909
Not Mr. Hoffmeister.

20:01.618 --> 20:02.619
Him too.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.624
It's good you came.

20:10.501 --> 20:11.711
I'm not sure.

20:14.088 --> 20:15.173
Good night.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.258
Good night, Adrien.

21:03.012 --> 21:06.057
HERE LIES FRANTZ HOFFMEISTER

21:18.486 --> 21:20.405
There's nothing under the flowers.

21:22.699 --> 21:23.700
Nothing?

21:25.451 --> 21:30.164
They buried him in France,
anonymously, with other soldiers.

21:32.375 --> 21:34.752
We only know the date of his death.

21:36.462 --> 21:38.965
Sometimes I feel like he's not dead.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.718
And he'll be back.

21:44.012 --> 21:46.055
I'm sure he can hear us.

21:52.937 --> 21:56.691
<i>The lingering wails of autumn violins</i>

21:57.859 --> 22:00.486
<i>Make my heart languish and sigh</i>

22:02.655 --> 22:04.574
<i>Breathless and pale</i>

22:05.199 --> 22:06.826
<i>When the bell tolls</i>

22:07.410 --> 22:10.580
<i>I remember days gone by</i>

22:11.331 --> 22:12.707
<i>And I cry</i>

22:15.335 --> 22:18.546
<i>And I go where ill winds blow</i>

22:19.088 --> 22:21.090
<i>Taking me to and fro</i>

22:21.174 --> 22:23.009
<i>Like a dead leaf</i>

22:25.720 --> 22:27.597
You have a lovely accent.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.434
We often spoke in French.

22:31.517 --> 22:33.603
Our secret language.

22:34.562 --> 22:36.564
Frantz loved France so much.

22:38.316 --> 22:40.485
But he never told me about you.

22:45.448 --> 22:46.991
What was it between you?

22:49.952 --> 22:51.287
A woman?

22:58.544 --> 22:59.379
Then what?

23:03.007 --> 23:04.592
Just friendship.

23:12.725 --> 23:14.268
I'd forgotten this...

23:17.188 --> 23:19.232
The sound of the wind in the leaves.

23:20.566 --> 23:22.985
That sound is why I love spring.

23:34.163 --> 23:35.331
This way.

23:58.688 --> 24:00.440
Did you two come here often?

24:01.149 --> 24:02.191
Yes.

24:02.608 --> 24:05.194
This is where Frantz asked for my hand.

24:06.529 --> 24:08.531
Before he left for the war.

24:11.993 --> 24:14.036
How did you meet?

24:14.620 --> 24:16.372
Didn't he tell you?

24:18.332 --> 24:20.960
In a bookshop when we were students.

24:22.253 --> 24:24.922
He was looking for French poetry...

24:25.506 --> 24:27.717
and I was looking for German poetry.

24:29.218 --> 24:32.180
He asked me who my favorite poet was.

24:33.139 --> 24:35.141
I said Rilke.

24:36.392 --> 24:37.852
And he said Verlaine.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.897
He could've told you about me.

24:47.487 --> 24:49.780
I was jealous of his studies in France.

24:50.323 --> 24:54.660
I wish I could have gone with him,
but I think he preferred to be alone.

24:55.286 --> 24:57.580
Far from his country, his family...

25:01.584 --> 25:04.128
He promised we'd go for our honeymoon.

25:06.214 --> 25:08.216
He'd show me Paris.

25:08.841 --> 25:11.010
The Eiffel Tower, the Louvre,

25:11.093 --> 25:12.553
the Grands Boulevards...

25:13.346 --> 25:14.472
I'm hot.

25:15.765 --> 25:17.183
Fancy a swim?

25:18.100 --> 25:20.019
We have no bathing suits.

25:20.102 --> 25:20.937
So what?

25:21.020 --> 25:22.688
Let's go.

25:58.641 --> 25:59.684
Feels great.

26:01.686 --> 26:03.229
You should've gone in.

26:04.605 --> 26:06.983
Actually, I don't know how to swim.

26:07.733 --> 26:09.026
Really?

26:10.194 --> 26:12.363
I could've taught you.

26:19.078 --> 26:20.871
Are those war wounds?

26:30.423 --> 26:32.049
You must've suffered a lot.

26:36.512 --> 26:38.431
My only wound is Frantz.

26:50.526 --> 26:52.111
He resembles him.

26:52.194 --> 26:53.529
Don't you think?

26:56.699 --> 27:01.078
Not physically, but in his demeanor.

27:01.162 --> 27:03.039
Shy and stormy.

27:03.664 --> 27:05.833
I'm glad he's here.

27:07.209 --> 27:08.919
Any brothers or sisters?

27:09.587 --> 27:10.588
No.

27:12.006 --> 27:14.467
I always wanted a brother.

27:16.427 --> 27:17.720
And your parents?

27:19.388 --> 27:22.642
My father died when I was a boy.

27:22.725 --> 27:25.978
My mother took over the domaine.

27:27.271 --> 27:29.649
It's been hard, with the war.

27:31.108 --> 27:32.568
What did your father do?

27:34.111 --> 27:35.196
Business.

27:36.864 --> 27:38.324
But he was mainly a musician.

27:39.825 --> 27:42.411
He passed down his passion to me.

27:42.495 --> 27:44.497
I studied at the Conservatory.

27:44.580 --> 27:50.211
Then I became a violinist
in the Orchestre de Paris.

27:50.961 --> 27:55.216
But now, since the war,
I can't do it anymore.

27:55.675 --> 27:57.259
You no longer want to play?

28:00.262 --> 28:02.098
I can't hear the notes.

28:06.519 --> 28:10.690
Often, Frantz would play violin for us.

28:11.440 --> 28:17.113
He was not a great musician,
but he played with all his heart.

28:44.640 --> 28:45.641
His room.

28:47.768 --> 28:50.479
It has remained as he left it.

28:53.065 --> 28:54.066
His books.

28:55.025 --> 28:57.945
His clothing, folded in the wardrobe.

29:01.282 --> 29:03.409
Frantz must've been happy here.

29:04.994 --> 29:05.995
Yes.

29:07.580 --> 29:09.248
But I ruined it all.

29:17.173 --> 29:20.634
I urged him to enlist.

29:24.764 --> 29:26.390
I sent him into battle.

29:28.142 --> 29:29.727
It was his duty.

29:31.020 --> 29:32.772
To serve the Fatherland.

29:33.314 --> 29:34.982
I was told the same thing.

29:54.084 --> 29:57.588
This... is like my son's heart.

30:10.768 --> 30:13.813
Take it to France.

30:15.397 --> 30:16.440
No.

30:18.484 --> 30:21.529
Tell them an old German gave it to you.

30:25.032 --> 30:26.575
No, I can't.

31:19.712 --> 31:22.590
This is the last photo of Frantz.

31:23.173 --> 31:25.301
The next day he left for the front.

31:26.010 --> 31:28.012
Frantz hated the war.

31:28.095 --> 31:31.932
He always said
the French were his brothers.

31:33.142 --> 31:34.184
That's enough now.

31:40.024 --> 31:41.650
Read it out loud.

31:42.902 --> 31:44.361
“My dear parents...

31:45.821 --> 31:49.366
How I long to run away and be near you,

31:49.450 --> 31:50.993
far from this chaos.

31:53.078 --> 31:55.706
This morning
we came across a dead soldier.

31:56.290 --> 31:58.584
As though he'd opened our eyes...

31:59.460 --> 32:03.464
we found ourselves in a sea of corpses.

32:03.547 --> 32:04.673
French?

32:04.757 --> 32:05.758
German?

32:06.300 --> 32:08.093
How could we tell?

32:08.886 --> 32:11.513
In school, French children learn German

32:11.597 --> 32:13.515
and German children learn French.

32:15.225 --> 32:18.604
And when they grow up,
they have to kill each other.”

32:18.687 --> 32:20.648
I must go. Thank you.

32:20.731 --> 32:22.232
Before you go...

32:23.442 --> 32:25.611
could you do us a favor?

32:40.668 --> 32:42.086
Play for us.

32:44.338 --> 32:47.716
Don't be afraid to make us happy.

34:20.100 --> 34:21.476
Will you be all right?

34:25.438 --> 34:27.649
Perhaps you caught cold at the lake.

34:29.985 --> 34:31.527
Frantz was a pacifist.

34:33.030 --> 34:34.447
Didn't you know?

34:37.993 --> 34:40.161
I'm sorry it upsets you.

34:41.205 --> 34:43.415
It doesn't. I felt the same.

34:54.467 --> 34:55.552
Feeling better?

34:56.386 --> 34:58.097
Will we see you tomorrow?

35:01.558 --> 35:03.602
This makes no sense.

35:03.685 --> 35:05.854
It does them good.

35:07.981 --> 35:09.024
Me too.

35:14.738 --> 35:17.866
Well then,
would you like to go to the ball?

35:18.325 --> 35:19.535
The ball?

35:20.452 --> 35:23.038
I saw a poster for the Spring Ball.

35:23.622 --> 35:25.707
- And I thought...
- All right.

36:07.833 --> 36:09.459
You look beautiful.

36:10.169 --> 36:12.087
The dress really suits you.

36:12.838 --> 36:14.256
- Does it?
- Yes.

36:15.257 --> 36:17.009
Frantz would've loved it.

36:17.634 --> 36:19.970
You're positively ravishing.

36:20.470 --> 36:24.474
Don't tell anyone,
but it's a French model.

36:24.558 --> 36:26.268
Straight from Paris.

36:34.943 --> 36:35.944
Thank you.

36:50.334 --> 36:52.085
That Frenchman.

36:52.169 --> 36:53.420
What's he doing here?

36:54.046 --> 36:56.089
Not sure this is a good idea.

36:56.840 --> 36:58.175
Don't worry.

36:58.634 --> 36:59.676
I'm here.

37:49.518 --> 37:50.519
Come.

37:51.270 --> 37:53.355
Oh, no... I can't.

37:53.438 --> 37:55.107
You can't waltz?

37:55.190 --> 37:57.651
No. Well, yes, but no.

37:57.734 --> 37:58.819
Come on.

38:32.561 --> 38:33.562
Am I okay?

38:47.993 --> 38:50.120
Would you like to dance with us?

39:16.063 --> 39:18.231
Thought you didn't have
the heart to dance?

39:20.400 --> 39:22.652
Someone talked you into it.

39:23.278 --> 39:25.030
He's a friend of Frantz's.

39:25.947 --> 39:27.866
Right. A Frenchy.

39:29.117 --> 39:30.285
So?

39:30.786 --> 39:34.748
A Frenchman here today, at a German party.

39:34.831 --> 39:36.875
Don't you read the papers?

39:36.958 --> 39:38.418
The war is over.

39:39.211 --> 39:40.837
Shame on you!

39:43.131 --> 39:45.675
I wanted to ask you for this dance.

39:45.759 --> 39:47.886
I see there's no point.

39:59.898 --> 40:00.899
Here...

40:01.316 --> 40:02.943
- Take my jacket.
- Thanks.

40:05.237 --> 40:07.155
I've never drunk so much.

40:08.448 --> 40:10.492
I've never danced so much.

40:10.575 --> 40:12.244
Frantz loved to dance.

40:12.911 --> 40:15.455
But he wasn't as popular as you.

40:15.539 --> 40:18.375
If he'd have come back, he would've been.

40:23.755 --> 40:25.215
Why do you say that?

40:25.298 --> 40:28.135
Because I'd have married him
and kept my eye on him.

40:34.307 --> 40:36.226
I see why you were friends.

40:44.484 --> 40:45.569
Your jacket.

40:50.574 --> 40:51.575
Thanks.

40:53.702 --> 40:55.078
Thank you too.

40:57.831 --> 40:58.915
Good night.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.001
Good night.

41:17.184 --> 41:19.436
- Shit...
- Can I help you?

41:20.604 --> 41:21.771
Are you all right?

41:27.068 --> 41:28.236
Are you okay?

41:29.321 --> 41:31.740
Hands off! You make me sick!

41:45.045 --> 41:45.879
<i>Dear Anna...</i>

41:47.631 --> 41:48.882
I must...

41:50.550 --> 41:53.136
write you this letter.

41:56.223 --> 41:59.267
I must tell you...

42:17.953 --> 42:19.371
Hello, my friends.

42:21.414 --> 42:24.501
I thought our meetings
no longer interested you.

42:24.584 --> 42:26.086
They do, more than ever.

42:26.169 --> 42:27.254
And...

42:28.046 --> 42:30.799
to make up for my absence...

42:31.508 --> 42:33.343
let me buy this round.

42:33.426 --> 42:34.594
Waiter...

42:36.137 --> 42:37.764
Eight beers, please.

42:37.847 --> 42:39.057
Count me out.

42:39.140 --> 42:42.018
- Seven, then.
- Make it six, Doctor.

42:42.102 --> 42:43.019
Five.

42:43.103 --> 42:44.271
Four.

42:51.736 --> 42:52.737
Fine.

42:53.446 --> 42:54.573
One beer for me.

42:56.741 --> 42:58.326
We were just talking about you.

42:59.619 --> 43:02.414
Then it's a good thing I came.

43:02.956 --> 43:05.292
You should've brought your new friend.

43:05.375 --> 43:06.376
True.

43:07.127 --> 43:08.378
That's a good idea.

43:16.052 --> 43:17.178
Gentlemen...

43:19.180 --> 43:22.017
That young man came from France...

43:23.226 --> 43:26.104
to place flowers on my son's grave.

43:28.398 --> 43:29.941
Show him some respect.

43:31.359 --> 43:33.778
Shall we sing <i>La Marseillaise</i> too?

43:35.196 --> 43:38.408
I stopped singing when my son died.

43:38.491 --> 43:40.660
And who killed your son?

43:40.744 --> 43:41.620
And my son?

43:41.703 --> 43:43.663
And my two sons?

43:47.375 --> 43:52.464
And my son, your son, yours...

43:53.590 --> 43:55.508
and your two boys...

43:55.592 --> 43:57.302
Who sent them to the front?

43:58.678 --> 44:01.640
Who furnished the ammunition and bayonets?

44:02.766 --> 44:03.642
We did.

44:05.810 --> 44:07.062
Their fathers.

44:08.229 --> 44:10.482
On our side, as on the other side.

44:13.026 --> 44:13.943
We...

44:15.278 --> 44:17.072
are responsible.

44:18.823 --> 44:22.327
When we killed their sons
by the thousands...

44:22.786 --> 44:25.997
we celebrated our victory
by drinking beer.

44:26.081 --> 44:29.334
And when they killed our sons...

44:30.210 --> 44:33.755
they celebrated by drinking wine.

44:37.592 --> 44:40.845
We are fathers who drink
to the death of our children.

44:47.977 --> 44:49.020
Good day.

44:50.146 --> 44:51.648
Good day, Adrien.

44:52.774 --> 44:54.192
How are you today?

44:54.734 --> 44:55.944
Much better.

44:56.027 --> 44:57.070
Good.

44:58.405 --> 45:00.365
Still coming to dinner?

45:00.448 --> 45:01.408
Yes.

45:01.491 --> 45:05.120
Magda's making her specialty.
You won't be disappointed.

45:05.203 --> 45:06.162
Thank you.

45:06.246 --> 45:07.414
See you tonight.

45:10.875 --> 45:13.253
<i>Dear fatherland</i>

45:13.336 --> 45:15.588
<i>No fear be thine</i>

45:20.969 --> 45:25.265
<i>Firm and true stands the watch</i>

45:25.348 --> 45:29.853
<i>The watch on the Rhine</i>

45:33.648 --> 45:35.108
My key, please.

45:37.110 --> 45:39.612
Let me introduce myself. Kreutz.

45:42.157 --> 45:44.159
So you were a friend of Frantz's?

45:46.327 --> 45:48.705
And you came here
to dance with his fiancée?

45:50.665 --> 45:52.375
I don't know what you mean.

45:52.459 --> 45:55.336
Our German maidens are pretty.
Good dancers too.

45:55.420 --> 45:56.337
Kreutz!

45:56.421 --> 45:57.964
Stop it.

45:59.048 --> 46:00.216
Imbecile.

46:28.495 --> 46:29.496
Good evening.

46:30.205 --> 46:31.539
Is Mr. Rivoire here?

46:31.623 --> 46:32.957
No, miss.

46:34.167 --> 46:35.293
Has he left?

46:35.376 --> 46:37.295
No, his train leaves tomorrow.

46:37.378 --> 46:38.505
And tonight?

46:39.589 --> 46:42.008
He went out without a word.

47:36.771 --> 47:38.356
I was waiting for you.

47:38.439 --> 47:40.358
How did you know I would come?

47:41.109 --> 47:42.193
I hoped you would.

47:43.361 --> 47:46.447
Why didn't you come for dinner?
Or let us know?

47:46.948 --> 47:47.991
You're right...

47:48.074 --> 47:49.826
You hurt their feelings.

47:50.368 --> 47:52.120
This has got to stop!

47:52.203 --> 47:55.874
Frantz! Me. This charade.

47:55.957 --> 47:57.542
What charade?

47:58.042 --> 47:59.919
Our Franco-German friendship.

48:05.466 --> 48:07.260
I have to confess everything.

48:08.761 --> 48:10.013
Confess what?

48:14.183 --> 48:16.269
“The noise is terrifying.

48:16.352 --> 48:17.979
You can't imagine.

48:20.398 --> 48:22.233
The battle will be horrendous.

48:22.817 --> 48:25.904
But we won't all die.
With any luck, I'll survive.

48:25.987 --> 48:28.489
In a pocket next to my heart,

48:28.573 --> 48:30.909
I keep the dried rose you sent me...”

48:30.992 --> 48:32.911
How do you know that letter?

48:38.124 --> 48:39.751
It was the 15th of September.

48:42.879 --> 48:45.006
The 15th of September, 1918.

48:50.762 --> 48:53.598
<i>My regiment was stationed
near Dormans, in the Marne.</i>

48:54.265 --> 48:56.684
<i>We got up like any other day.</i>

48:57.810 --> 49:01.981
<i>We were trudging through the fields
on reconnaissance. Quietly.</i>

49:04.275 --> 49:07.362
<i>Suddenly, the enemy launched an assault.</i>

49:09.072 --> 49:11.324
<i>Some of us were hit right away.</i>

49:19.290 --> 49:20.500
<i>I ran.</i>

49:22.460 --> 49:25.505
<i>I ran for the shelter of the trenches.</i>

49:31.260 --> 49:33.763
<i>I came face to face with a man.</i>

49:34.764 --> 49:36.516
<i>He, a German soldier.</i>

49:37.308 --> 49:38.893
<i>I, a French soldier.</i>

49:39.727 --> 49:42.063
<i>His eyes were so big, so full of despair.</i>

49:42.689 --> 49:45.400
<i>Did they express sadness at dying...</i>

49:46.401 --> 49:48.820
<i>or pity for me at having to kill him?</i>

49:56.703 --> 49:57.662
<i>I shot my gun.</i>

49:59.414 --> 50:00.707
<i>I shot first.</i>

50:01.416 --> 50:02.458
<i>And he fell.</i>

50:22.603 --> 50:24.647
I'm the one who killed Frantz.

50:25.732 --> 50:26.899
Not you.

50:27.984 --> 50:31.738
If only he'd shot me,
wounded me... but no.

50:33.239 --> 50:35.366
His rifle wasn't even loaded.

50:36.909 --> 50:38.494
He didn't defend himself.

50:41.956 --> 50:45.835
<i>A shell struck nearby
and I was blown on top of him.</i>

50:47.045 --> 50:50.214
<i>Our two bodies lying together.</i>

50:51.174 --> 50:52.091
<i>Him...</i>

50:52.592 --> 50:53.468
<i>dead.</i>

50:54.302 --> 50:55.553
<i>And me alive.</i>

51:19.869 --> 51:21.954
<i>There was a letter in his jacket.</i>

51:22.789 --> 51:24.082
<i>I read it.</i>

51:25.958 --> 51:27.418
<i>It's been with me since.</i>

51:29.003 --> 51:30.254
<i>Etched into me.</i>

51:34.008 --> 51:37.178
The letter was for you, Anna.

51:39.847 --> 51:41.849
Why did you come here?

51:43.684 --> 51:45.561
To ask for your forgiveness.

51:49.607 --> 51:51.150
To unburden myself.

51:53.027 --> 51:55.321
To learn about the man I killed.

51:56.447 --> 51:59.742
I wanted to tell you right away
but you saw me here.

51:59.826 --> 52:03.538
You believed in our friendship.
I didn't dare set you straight.

52:05.414 --> 52:08.417
Thanks to my lie,
I've gotten to know Frantz.

52:10.002 --> 52:11.629
His family, his house...

52:12.338 --> 52:13.422
his fiancée.

52:15.508 --> 52:17.593
Each day, I've loved him a bit more.

52:20.972 --> 52:23.307
Each day, my pain has grown more acute.

52:26.769 --> 52:28.563
So the Louvre...

52:29.730 --> 52:33.192
the Manet paintings, the violin lessons...

52:33.943 --> 52:35.653
You lied to us.

52:37.321 --> 52:38.281
Yes.

52:42.535 --> 52:44.162
I'm a coward.

52:55.756 --> 52:58.634
And maybe it made us all feel better.

53:12.899 --> 53:14.233
Wait!

53:15.693 --> 53:17.570
My train leaves tomorrow at noon.

53:21.449 --> 53:23.659
I'll go tell them everything.

53:27.413 --> 53:28.456
See you tomorrow.

54:26.597 --> 54:27.807
Good morning.

54:27.890 --> 54:29.475
Good morning, Mr. Rivoire.

54:29.558 --> 54:30.977
My bill, please.

54:31.644 --> 54:32.603
Right away.

54:45.491 --> 54:48.286
I was about to go see the Hoffmeisters.

54:48.369 --> 54:49.620
No need. I told them everything.

54:58.629 --> 55:00.047
How did they take it?

55:01.090 --> 55:02.466
As any parents would.

55:08.097 --> 55:09.890
They don't want to see me anymore?

55:11.225 --> 55:12.184
Right.

55:17.315 --> 55:18.774
I understand.

55:25.781 --> 55:26.741
Let's go.

55:30.578 --> 55:32.538
Carriage 6. Have a nice trip.

55:42.381 --> 55:44.925
Could I write to them after a while?

55:46.177 --> 55:47.511
I don't think so.

55:48.929 --> 55:50.014
Anna...

55:51.140 --> 55:52.725
I need to write to them.

55:57.021 --> 55:59.398
Then write directly to me.

56:00.191 --> 56:02.360
I'll read them your letter.

56:02.902 --> 56:04.278
You're right.

56:11.827 --> 56:13.329
Thank you for everything.

56:14.413 --> 56:15.581
Farewell.

57:04.672 --> 57:06.757
Did you kiss him for us?

57:08.884 --> 57:11.554
I hope his mother is not too ill.

57:11.637 --> 57:15.516
Did you tell him we hope
to hear him play violin again?

57:16.100 --> 57:17.351
I did.

57:17.435 --> 57:19.270
When might he be back?

57:20.396 --> 57:23.732
That'll depend on his mother and his work.

57:24.483 --> 57:27.153
Soon, no doubt. Two or three months.

57:27.236 --> 57:28.529
Wonderful.

57:28.612 --> 57:30.406
Let's eat.

57:33.033 --> 57:35.453
He could've come to tell us good-bye.

57:37.329 --> 57:38.873
He's sorry about that.

57:40.958 --> 57:43.127
One always forgives the young.

59:15.010 --> 59:16.387
<i>My dear Anna,</i>

59:16.845 --> 59:19.265
<i>I'm writing this letter in French,</i>

59:19.348 --> 59:21.642
<i>to be sure my parents can't read it.</i>

59:21.725 --> 59:23.769
<i>I hope you'll get it.</i>

59:23.852 --> 59:25.229
<i>It's cold and muddy here.</i>

59:26.230 --> 59:29.024
<i>An attack could be launched at any moment.</i>

59:29.108 --> 59:30.693
<i>The noise is terrifying.</i>

59:31.151 --> 59:32.778
<i>You can't imagine.</i>

59:34.613 --> 59:36.323
<i>The battle will be horrendous.</i>

59:36.949 --> 59:40.244
<i>But we won't all die.
With any luck, I'll survive.</i>

59:41.662 --> 59:43.956
<i>In a pocket next to my heart...</i>

59:44.540 --> 59:47.668
<i>I keep the dried rose
you sent me in your last letter.</i>

59:50.296 --> 59:53.924
<i>Promise me, my dear Anna,
that' if anything happens to me</i>

59:54.008 --> 59:55.676
<i>you will keep loving life...</i>

59:56.427 --> 59:57.720
<i>and be happy.</i>

01:03:08.452 --> 01:03:10.037
Why did you do that?

01:03:11.830 --> 01:03:13.832
Enough death, with the war.

01:03:15.918 --> 01:03:18.003
You live at Dr. Hoffmeister's?

01:03:21.924 --> 01:03:23.550
Don't tell anyone.

01:03:41.401 --> 01:03:43.237
Still a slight fever.

01:03:44.321 --> 01:03:45.739
You must eat.

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:48.575
It's nice and hot.

01:03:53.747 --> 01:03:55.123
I'm not hungry.

01:03:55.582 --> 01:03:58.085
You used to have such a good appetite.

01:03:59.586 --> 01:04:03.048
The bookseller received
the book you ordered.

01:04:03.841 --> 01:04:05.050
Thank you, Magda.

01:05:20.918 --> 01:05:22.461
A little fresh air.

01:05:26.548 --> 01:05:27.799
Anna...

01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:31.929
When we lost Frantz...

01:05:33.388 --> 01:05:35.223
you comforted us.

01:05:36.391 --> 01:05:38.644
You helped us survive.

01:05:40.729 --> 01:05:42.522
Now it's our turn.

01:05:43.815 --> 01:05:46.234
However, you must get up.

01:05:47.235 --> 01:05:48.487
You must go outside.

01:05:49.613 --> 01:05:51.114
You must live.

01:06:00.457 --> 01:06:02.209
Something for you.

01:06:02.292 --> 01:06:03.293
What is it?

01:06:08.924 --> 01:06:09.967
I'll be right back.

01:06:11.718 --> 01:06:12.678
Excuse me.

01:06:14.179 --> 01:06:16.640
- What is it?
- A letter from Paris.

01:06:18.892 --> 01:06:20.143
Finally.

01:06:25.857 --> 01:06:27.150
<i>Dear Anna,</i>

01:06:27.234 --> 01:06:30.946
<i>As promised,
I waited several weeks before writing.</i>

01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:33.115
<i>My return to France has been difficult,</i>

01:06:33.573 --> 01:06:35.325
<i>but I'm trying to survive.</i>

01:06:35.409 --> 01:06:37.577
<i>I'm enclosing my letter
for Frantz's parents.</i>

01:06:38.370 --> 01:06:40.789
<i>I know it cannot expunge my crime,</i>

01:06:40.872 --> 01:06:43.959
<i>but I hope it will explain
why I came to you all.</i>

01:06:45.085 --> 01:06:47.546
<i>I know forgiveness is impossible.</i>

01:06:48.046 --> 01:06:51.800
<i>But please, write back to me.
I await your letter, Anna.</i>

01:06:51.883 --> 01:06:53.218
“Since my return,

01:06:53.301 --> 01:06:55.303
I've been caring for my mother.

01:06:56.221 --> 01:06:57.806
She's doing much better.

01:06:57.889 --> 01:07:02.102
I told her about the wonderful time
I spent with you,

01:07:03.103 --> 01:07:05.355
Frantz's dear family.

01:07:07.232 --> 01:07:09.735
In Paris, life goes on.

01:07:10.777 --> 01:07:14.156
Everyone's trying to forget
the pain of the war.

01:07:15.407 --> 01:07:19.411
I'm pleased to be playing
with the Orchestre de Paris again.

01:07:20.579 --> 01:07:22.956
The music soothes me...”

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:27.711
<i>The music soothes me,
gives me strength and restores my joy.</i>

01:07:28.211 --> 01:07:30.630
<i>We'll be going on tour for several months,</i>

01:07:30.714 --> 01:07:33.925
<i>but as soon as time permits,
I'll try to come see you.</i>

01:07:34.009 --> 01:07:37.763
<i>I promise Dr. Hoffmeister
I will play Frantz's violin again.</i>

01:07:38.805 --> 01:07:41.433
<i>My dear friends, I hope you are well.</i>

01:07:41.516 --> 01:07:42.851
“I hope you are well.

01:07:44.102 --> 01:07:47.481
I miss you
and the clean air of Quedlinburg.

01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:49.441
See you very soon.

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:51.068
Your Adrien.”

01:07:54.738 --> 01:07:56.531
Did you read us everything?

01:08:03.413 --> 01:08:05.791
We received your letter...

01:08:07.876 --> 01:08:08.877
and...

01:08:29.981 --> 01:08:31.774
<i>Father, you know my lie...</i>

01:08:32.442 --> 01:08:34.528
and the anguish it causes me.

01:08:36.071 --> 01:08:38.782
God in his infinite wisdom
has heard you, my child.

01:08:41.993 --> 01:08:44.412
Though he condemns lying...

01:08:45.663 --> 01:08:49.042
your silence
regarding the death of your fiancé

01:08:49.126 --> 01:08:52.295
comes from a pure intention
and is thus excused.

01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:57.008
So I shouldn't tell them?

01:08:58.426 --> 01:09:00.303
What would the truth bring?

01:09:02.889 --> 01:09:04.390
Only more pain.

01:09:06.184 --> 01:09:07.685
Only more tears.

01:09:11.523 --> 01:09:14.442
What do you feel for the young Frenchman?

01:09:18.697 --> 01:09:20.115
I don't know anymore.

01:09:22.367 --> 01:09:24.618
He killed the man I loved.

01:09:27.247 --> 01:09:29.624
That French soldier...

01:09:30.792 --> 01:09:33.002
came to Germany...

01:09:33.545 --> 01:09:35.546
to ask forgiveness.

01:09:38.925 --> 01:09:40.176
Forgive him.

01:09:41.928 --> 01:09:45.182
As Jesus forgave those who crucified him.

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:49.185
I absolve you from your sins, my child.

01:10:00.655 --> 01:10:01.698
Amen.

01:10:10.749 --> 01:10:12.000
Good day, Anna.

01:10:13.793 --> 01:10:15.212
Good day, Mr. Kreutz.

01:10:16.338 --> 01:10:17.714
How are you feeling?

01:10:18.173 --> 01:10:19.466
Well, thank you.

01:10:19.549 --> 01:10:21.509
I heard you'd taken ill.

01:10:22.928 --> 01:10:24.179
That's over now.

01:10:24.638 --> 01:10:25.889
Glad to hear it.

01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:30.268
My behavior was foolish, idiotic.

01:10:31.353 --> 01:10:36.358
So many Germans died in France.
It's easy to feel angry at a Frenchman.

01:10:37.776 --> 01:10:38.735
I know.

01:10:39.277 --> 01:10:42.030
I don't share
Dr. Hoffmeister's convictions...

01:10:43.406 --> 01:10:47.619
but it was brave of him
to open his doors to a Frenchman...

01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:50.789
who could've killed his son.

01:10:54.751 --> 01:10:57.337
I'm sorry to bring that up again.

01:11:01.299 --> 01:11:03.718
I know how much you loved Frantz.

01:11:08.765 --> 01:11:11.101
I saw Kreutz this afternoon.

01:11:11.851 --> 01:11:12.769
And?

01:11:14.938 --> 01:11:16.731
He asked for my hand again.

01:11:18.275 --> 01:11:19.859
He never gives up.

01:11:26.032 --> 01:11:27.325
What if I were to say yes?

01:11:31.288 --> 01:11:33.290
You want to marry him?

01:11:34.332 --> 01:11:35.792
That was your wish.

01:11:35.875 --> 01:11:38.128
Before we met Adrien.

01:11:44.384 --> 01:11:45.593
<i>Dear Adrien...</i>

01:11:46.136 --> 01:11:49.139
<i>Forgive me for taking so long
to write you back.</i>

01:11:49.222 --> 01:11:51.558
<i>Our pain is still immense,</i>

01:11:51.641 --> 01:11:54.728
<i>but we know that you, like Frantz,</i>

01:11:54.811 --> 01:11:57.272
<i>are a victim of that horrible war.</i>

01:11:58.064 --> 01:12:01.151
<i>You were forced
to kill an enemy in wartime.</i>

01:12:01.234 --> 01:12:04.446
<i>You did your duty as a French soldier.</i>

01:12:06.406 --> 01:12:10.493
<i>I've come to understand
and accept your lie.</i>

01:12:11.995 --> 01:12:13.288
To France.

01:12:13.371 --> 01:12:15.999
<i>Autumn promises to be lovely this year.</i>

01:12:16.624 --> 01:12:18.209
<i>We're ready to see you again.</i>

01:12:19.419 --> 01:12:20.920
<i>Feel free to write to me.</i>

01:12:21.004 --> 01:12:24.424
<i>I promise I'll write you back immediately.</i>

01:12:25.175 --> 01:12:26.384
<i>Your Anna.</i>

01:12:32.807 --> 01:12:34.684
“Return to sender”.

01:12:35.393 --> 01:12:37.479
He's no longer at this address.

01:12:38.229 --> 01:12:39.856
Do you have another one?

01:12:41.566 --> 01:12:42.484
No.

01:12:48.281 --> 01:12:51.951
You must find Adrien, as he found us.

01:12:52.035 --> 01:12:53.870
Impossible, Magda.

01:12:55.413 --> 01:12:56.790
You know his name

01:12:56.873 --> 01:12:58.875
and his former address.

01:12:58.958 --> 01:13:00.460
You'll find him.

01:13:01.252 --> 01:13:03.797
What if something has happened to him?

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:05.757
It's better to know.

01:13:06.633 --> 01:13:08.760
You can't be left in the dark.

01:13:11.805 --> 01:13:13.640
You're young and beautiful.

01:13:13.723 --> 01:13:15.558
Your whole life is ahead of you.

01:13:15.642 --> 01:13:20.688
Don't let this chance pass you by.
Go to France and bring him back to us.

01:13:34.369 --> 01:13:35.537
Have a good trip, Anna.

01:13:37.831 --> 01:13:39.290
Be safe.

01:13:41.042 --> 01:13:44.504
Give Adrien our love.
Tell him we're waiting for him.

01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:48.925
Everything will be fine.

01:13:56.558 --> 01:13:58.017
Bon voyage!

01:13:58.601 --> 01:13:59.561
See you soon.

01:14:00.979 --> 01:14:01.813
Good-bye.

01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:38.600
- Carriage 2.
- Thank you.

01:14:54.699 --> 01:14:55.825
Passports, please.

01:15:01.456 --> 01:15:02.290
German?

01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:08.296
- Why have you come to France?
- To see a friend.

01:15:08.379 --> 01:15:09.964
A prisoner?

01:15:11.132 --> 01:15:12.592
No, he's French.

01:17:04.245 --> 01:17:06.497
Evening, little lady. Where to?

01:17:06.581 --> 01:17:09.292
Hôtel des Camélias, Passage des Arcanes.

01:17:09.375 --> 01:17:10.960
Right. Get in.

01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:22.347
- First time at that hotel?
- Yes.

01:17:23.097 --> 01:17:25.892
My fiance stayed there before the war.

01:17:27.435 --> 01:17:29.437
I can see why.

01:17:30.730 --> 01:17:32.231
Bet he had fun.

01:17:53.086 --> 01:17:54.420
Room 3.

01:17:55.129 --> 01:17:57.840
Upstairs, on the left.

01:18:06.891 --> 01:18:08.142
Tomorrow?

01:18:08.226 --> 01:18:09.310
The day after?

01:19:09.454 --> 01:19:10.621
Excuse me, madam.

01:19:10.705 --> 01:19:13.833
I'm looking for Adrien Rivoire.
He used to live here?

01:19:13.916 --> 01:19:16.919
- Yes, but he left some time ago.
- When?

01:19:17.003 --> 01:19:18.796
A few months ago.

01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:21.007
Do you know where he lives now?

01:19:21.090 --> 01:19:23.885
He left no forwarding address.
I've got mail for him.

01:19:23.968 --> 01:19:27.013
- Any idea how I could find him?
- None at all.

01:19:27.096 --> 01:19:28.389
Good-bye, miss.

01:19:40.443 --> 01:19:43.112
I'm looking for violinist Adrien Rivoire.

01:19:43.196 --> 01:19:44.405
Do you know him?

01:19:44.489 --> 01:19:47.074
Sorry, I don't know the musicians by name.

01:19:47.158 --> 01:19:49.285
He works here,
with the Orchestre de Paris.

01:19:49.368 --> 01:19:52.371
There are tickets available for tonight.

01:19:53.372 --> 01:19:55.208
<i>Dear Magda, dear Hans...</i>

01:19:55.958 --> 01:19:57.543
<i>The trip went well.</i>

01:19:57.627 --> 01:20:00.004
<i>I have arrived in Paris.</i>

01:20:00.463 --> 01:20:03.549
<i>Everything is different
from what Frantz told us.</i>

01:20:03.633 --> 01:20:06.344
<i>I suppose the war changed many things.</i>

01:20:07.178 --> 01:20:08.304
<i>As planned,</i>

01:20:08.387 --> 01:20:12.642
<i>I'm staying at the same hotel
Frantz stayed in as a student.</i>

01:20:12.725 --> 01:20:17.480
<i>Tonight I'm going to the Opéra
in the hopes of finding Adrien.</i>

01:20:17.563 --> 01:20:22.485
<i>First, I'll go to the Louvre to see
the paintings Frantz loved so much.</i>

01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:34.914
To all our sons,

01:20:34.997 --> 01:20:37.208
who gave their lives for France.

01:20:37.625 --> 01:20:41.879
<i>Arise, children of the Fatherland</i>

01:20:41.963 --> 01:20:45.258
<i>The day of glory has arrived</i>

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:49.762
<i>Against us in tyranny</i>

01:20:50.221 --> 01:20:54.308
<i>The bloody banner is raised</i>

01:20:54.392 --> 01:20:58.479
<i>The bloody banner is raised</i>

01:20:58.563 --> 01:21:02.483
<i>In our fields we can hear</i>

01:21:02.567 --> 01:21:07.029
<i>The howling of fearsome soldiers</i>

01:21:07.113 --> 01:21:11.576
<i>Who are coming into our midst</i>

01:21:11.659 --> 01:21:16.163
<i>To cut the throats
of your sons and consorts</i>

01:21:16.247 --> 01:21:20.334
<i>To arms, citizens!</i>

01:21:20.418 --> 01:21:24.255
<i>Form your battalions!</i>

01:21:24.338 --> 01:21:26.299
<i>March on</i>

01:21:26.382 --> 01:21:29.093
<i>March on</i>

01:21:29.176 --> 01:21:33.139
<i>Let impure blood</i>

01:21:33.222 --> 01:21:36.893
<i>Water our furrows!</i>

01:21:58.497 --> 01:22:01.417
Good day, sir.
I'm looking for a Manet painting

01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:04.003
of a young man with his head thrown back.

01:22:04.086 --> 01:22:05.922
In the back on the right.

01:22:06.005 --> 01:22:06.964
Thank you.

01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:44.895
Excuse me, may I?

01:24:38.783 --> 01:24:42.703
I had him for a week,
then he was moved to another ward.

01:24:43.287 --> 01:24:44.663
He was very ill?

01:24:45.289 --> 01:24:47.792
Some pull through, others don't.

01:24:50.044 --> 01:24:51.295
So he committed suicide.

01:24:51.378 --> 01:24:54.924
I didn't say that. But he was fragile.

01:24:55.007 --> 01:24:56.217
An artist.

01:24:57.593 --> 01:25:02.181
Go to the office
and consult the patients' register.

01:25:24.411 --> 01:25:26.372
PASSY CEMETERY

01:25:47.226 --> 01:25:48.519
Are you all right?

01:25:59.613 --> 01:26:03.409
Excuse me, sir.
I'm looking for Mr. Rivoire's grave.

01:26:03.492 --> 01:26:04.702
Rivoire...

01:26:04.785 --> 01:26:06.120
He died in August.

01:26:06.871 --> 01:26:08.581
Down that aisle on the right.

01:26:46.911 --> 01:26:48.412
TO MY BELOVED HUSBAND

01:26:48.954 --> 01:26:51.749
ANATOLE RIVOIRE
OFFICER OF THE LEGION OF HONOR

01:27:15.648 --> 01:27:16.607
Good day.

01:27:17.650 --> 01:27:19.485
Does Mrs. Rivoire live here?

01:27:20.152 --> 01:27:21.362
May I see her?

01:27:22.571 --> 01:27:23.948
Come in, miss.

01:27:28.869 --> 01:27:31.664
My husband
was critically wounded in Verdun.

01:27:31.747 --> 01:27:33.707
They amputated both his legs.

01:27:34.416 --> 01:27:36.919
He lost the will to live after that.

01:27:38.087 --> 01:27:40.464
He took matters into his own hands.

01:27:44.802 --> 01:27:48.389
But it's not Anatole
you're looking for, it's Adrien.

01:27:50.641 --> 01:27:54.103
I remember
seeing him at the Opera before the war.

01:27:54.770 --> 01:27:56.438
A handsome young man.

01:27:56.522 --> 01:27:59.358
His mother and Anatole had fallen out.

01:27:59.441 --> 01:28:01.026
Over an inheritance.

01:28:01.110 --> 01:28:02.903
Do you know where he might be?

01:28:04.196 --> 01:28:06.448
You're from Germany, aren't you?

01:28:10.202 --> 01:28:12.037
What is your relationship with Adrien?

01:28:14.039 --> 01:28:15.708
We're friends.

01:29:10.721 --> 01:29:12.431
Excuse me, sir.

01:29:12.514 --> 01:29:14.683
I'm looking for the Rivoire house.

01:29:14.767 --> 01:29:16.935
The château's on the edge of town.

01:29:52.805 --> 01:29:53.722
Good day.

01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:56.767
So you're little Anna?

01:29:57.226 --> 01:29:59.228
Yes. Good day, madam.

01:29:59.311 --> 01:30:01.063
What a surprise.

01:30:01.146 --> 01:30:03.399
My son has told me so much about you.

01:30:03.482 --> 01:30:04.983
He'll be so happy.

01:30:05.692 --> 01:30:07.069
Let me embrace you.

01:30:09.571 --> 01:30:12.324
Félicie, come get her things.

01:30:12.908 --> 01:30:16.286
Adrien will be here soon. He's out riding.

01:30:17.496 --> 01:30:18.705
Come with me.

01:30:19.957 --> 01:30:21.834
Do you understand me?

01:30:21.917 --> 01:30:23.794
Are you fluent in French?

01:30:24.503 --> 01:30:25.421
Wonderful.

01:30:26.713 --> 01:30:29.174
It was hard when he came back.

01:30:29.258 --> 01:30:30.884
Everything's better now.

01:30:31.552 --> 01:30:34.012
He left Paris, his orchestra

01:30:34.471 --> 01:30:36.390
and came back to live here,

01:30:36.473 --> 01:30:37.558
with me.

01:30:38.392 --> 01:30:40.602
He helps me run the domaine.

01:30:41.562 --> 01:30:43.021
Here he is.

01:30:43.105 --> 01:30:45.232
Adrien, look who's here.

01:30:52.948 --> 01:30:53.824
My God, Anna...

01:30:57.995 --> 01:31:00.247
You, here. In France.

01:31:02.082 --> 01:31:03.834
How did you find us?

01:31:03.917 --> 01:31:06.044
I came to Paris for a visit...

01:31:07.379 --> 01:31:09.256
Your aunt gave me this address.

01:31:09.339 --> 01:31:11.008
I'm so happy.

01:31:12.134 --> 01:31:12.968
Have a seat.

01:31:16.472 --> 01:31:18.724
Which hotel are you staying at?

01:31:18.807 --> 01:31:20.350
I don't know yet.

01:31:20.434 --> 01:31:22.311
There's a charming inn in town...

01:31:22.394 --> 01:31:24.229
We have room here.

01:31:25.606 --> 01:31:26.565
Yes, of course.

01:31:27.065 --> 01:31:31.278
We're having some friends over
for dinner and a recital.

01:31:31.361 --> 01:31:32.946
Please join us.

01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:34.114
Thank you.

01:31:34.198 --> 01:31:35.240
Tell me, Anna...

01:31:36.033 --> 01:31:37.409
How are they doing?

01:31:38.118 --> 01:31:38.952
Who?

01:31:39.036 --> 01:31:40.454
The Hoffmeisters.

01:31:44.625 --> 01:31:45.626
Quite well.

01:31:45.709 --> 01:31:47.252
Really?

01:31:52.716 --> 01:31:53.717
Life goes on.

01:31:58.805 --> 01:32:00.724
Why didn't you answer my letters?

01:32:00.807 --> 01:32:04.436
I was desperate to hear from you.

01:32:06.313 --> 01:32:07.439
I know.

01:32:08.273 --> 01:32:10.192
I should have written you sooner.

01:32:12.611 --> 01:32:14.279
But it wasn't easy.

01:32:16.073 --> 01:32:17.699
Because of the Hoffmeisters?

01:32:22.162 --> 01:32:23.747
They've forgiven you.

01:32:28.293 --> 01:32:30.879
I came to tell you in person.

01:32:34.633 --> 01:32:35.676
And you, Anna?

01:32:39.179 --> 01:32:40.180
Me too.

01:32:46.687 --> 01:32:47.604
Thank you.

01:32:49.064 --> 01:32:51.483
Those are the sweetest words
I'll ever hear.

01:32:53.902 --> 01:32:56.238
Though I will never forgive myself.

01:32:58.156 --> 01:32:59.575
Time, Adrien.

01:33:00.784 --> 01:33:02.619
Time will help you forget.

01:33:09.251 --> 01:33:10.669
Want to swim again?

01:33:12.296 --> 01:33:14.214
Will you join me this time?

01:33:14.298 --> 01:33:15.632
Sure.

01:33:15.716 --> 01:33:17.342
Have you learned to swim?

01:33:17.426 --> 01:33:18.302
No.

01:33:18.969 --> 01:33:20.429
I was waiting for you.

01:33:30.522 --> 01:33:31.815
You know, Anna...

01:33:34.401 --> 01:33:37.654
When I came back from Germany,
I wanted to die.

01:33:41.700 --> 01:33:42.701
So did I.

01:33:46.288 --> 01:33:47.414
Really?

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.336
I didn't want to feel anything anymore.

01:33:53.378 --> 01:33:55.130
No more sadness.

01:33:55.964 --> 01:33:56.965
But...

01:33:58.467 --> 01:33:59.968
that was selfish.

01:34:04.806 --> 01:34:06.767
We must live for others as well.

01:34:24.076 --> 01:34:25.911
Anna, this is Fanny.

01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:29.831
Good day, Anna.

01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:32.167
So pleased to meet you.

01:34:32.250 --> 01:34:35.253
Adrien tells me
wonderful things about you.

01:34:35.337 --> 01:34:37.214
You'll be hearing her tonight.

01:34:37.297 --> 01:34:39.132
Fanny sings beautifully.

01:34:39.216 --> 01:34:40.300
You're too kind.

01:34:40.384 --> 01:34:43.387
But it's true. Your voice is divine.

01:34:43.470 --> 01:34:45.305
Isn't it, Adrien?

01:34:45.389 --> 01:34:46.932
Yes, it certainly is.

01:34:49.226 --> 01:34:51.895
I think your room is ready.

01:34:51.978 --> 01:34:53.563
Félicie will take you.

01:34:54.106 --> 01:34:55.273
It's upstairs.

01:35:12.249 --> 01:35:14.251
This is your room, miss.

01:35:47.075 --> 01:35:48.201
Come in.

01:35:50.412 --> 01:35:52.622
Excuse me, am I disturbing you?

01:35:53.790 --> 01:35:55.125
I was just unpacking.

01:35:55.208 --> 01:35:58.128
I wondered
if you needed a dress for tonight.

01:35:58.628 --> 01:36:01.006
I don't suppose you planned for it.

01:36:03.884 --> 01:36:05.802
We must be about the same size.

01:36:15.645 --> 01:36:17.022
It's perfect.

01:36:17.105 --> 01:36:18.565
It really suits you.

01:36:19.024 --> 01:36:20.901
I'll help you with the belt.

01:36:22.569 --> 01:36:23.487
Thank you.

01:36:24.029 --> 01:36:25.739
Thank you, Anna.

01:36:25.822 --> 01:36:28.116
For all you've done for Adrien.

01:36:29.284 --> 01:36:30.660
I haven't done anything.

01:36:31.286 --> 01:36:33.872
You welcomed him, listened to him.

01:36:33.955 --> 01:36:36.541
You could have turned him away.

01:36:38.919 --> 01:36:41.671
Adrien's family
thought he'd lost his mind.

01:36:42.506 --> 01:36:45.383
Only I encouraged his trip to Germany.

01:36:48.553 --> 01:36:50.680
He wanted to be forgiven.

01:36:51.348 --> 01:36:53.642
Replace the man he'd killed.

01:36:56.478 --> 01:36:59.606
But... such things are impossible.

01:37:01.775 --> 01:37:04.277
We can never replace a loved one, can we?

01:37:06.238 --> 01:37:07.405
I don't know.

01:37:16.498 --> 01:37:18.458
Your fiancé's name was Frantz?

01:37:25.799 --> 01:37:27.843
My brother's name was François.

01:37:30.178 --> 01:37:31.680
He was 20.

01:37:32.514 --> 01:37:34.432
He died at the front, too.

01:37:42.023 --> 01:37:44.526
Adrien tells me you play piano.

01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:48.530
Yes, a little.

01:37:48.613 --> 01:37:50.782
Then you'll play with us tonight.

01:37:51.366 --> 01:37:54.744
They had us ringing the bells
all day long.

01:37:54.828 --> 01:37:57.622
Even the deaf could hear those bells!

01:37:57.706 --> 01:38:01.459
It was madness.
We wondered how we'd sleep!

01:38:01.543 --> 01:38:02.878
And we didn't sleep!

01:38:02.961 --> 01:38:05.547
Should've stuffed
your ears with cotton, old girl!

01:38:07.173 --> 01:38:10.218
Adrien, were you still in Paris
on Armistice Day?

01:38:10.302 --> 01:38:12.470
Yes. In the madhouse.

01:38:16.892 --> 01:38:18.518
And you, Anna?

01:38:18.602 --> 01:38:20.604
What was it like in Germany?

01:38:20.687 --> 01:38:22.647
How can you ask such a question?

01:38:22.731 --> 01:38:23.732
I'm sorry.

01:38:23.815 --> 01:38:25.650
I've put my foot in it!

01:38:26.943 --> 01:38:29.154
But it would be interesting to know.

01:38:32.991 --> 01:38:34.492
The bells rang, too.

01:38:36.828 --> 01:38:39.331
We felt relieved.

01:38:39.414 --> 01:38:40.624
Some even danced.

01:38:41.625 --> 01:38:43.168
You see, Fanny?

01:38:43.251 --> 01:38:45.795
The French weren't the only ones dancing.

01:38:46.838 --> 01:38:48.006
On dead bodies.

01:38:50.967 --> 01:38:52.636
Cheese, anyone?

01:38:53.178 --> 01:38:54.471
I'd love some.

01:38:55.388 --> 01:38:57.390
Armand, the cheese, please.

01:39:01.519 --> 01:39:04.606
<i>Starry night</i>

01:39:05.231 --> 01:39:08.193
<i>In your veiled light</i>

01:39:08.777 --> 01:39:12.948
<i>In your soft breeze</i>

01:39:13.031 --> 01:39:15.450
<i>With its sweet scent</i>

01:39:16.868 --> 01:39:20.497
<i>A sad lyre</i>

01:39:20.580 --> 01:39:24.292
<i>Woefully sighs</i>

01:39:24.376 --> 01:39:29.047
<i>And I dream</i>

01:39:29.130 --> 01:39:32.175
<i>Of loves now gone</i>

01:39:33.009 --> 01:39:37.222
<i>I dream of loves</i>

01:39:37.305 --> 01:39:40.183
<i>Now gone</i>

01:39:40.809 --> 01:39:44.688
<i>A serene melancholy</i>

01:39:44.771 --> 01:39:48.149
<i>Rises from deep in my heart</i>

01:39:48.733 --> 01:39:51.236
<i>And I hear</i>

01:39:51.319 --> 01:39:54.572
<i>The soul of my love</i>

01:39:54.656 --> 01:39:58.034
<i>Murmuring here in the woods</i>

01:40:02.831 --> 01:40:03.665
Sorry.

01:40:05.333 --> 01:40:06.501
I can't do it.

01:40:08.545 --> 01:40:11.423
Forgive her. She's had a long trip.

01:40:11.506 --> 01:40:12.507
Go ahead.

01:40:12.590 --> 01:40:14.801
Why exactly has she come to France?

01:40:17.012 --> 01:40:18.972
To steal our Adrien, I suppose.

01:40:34.821 --> 01:40:39.034
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come.

01:40:39.117 --> 01:40:40.326
Why do you say that?

01:40:40.785 --> 01:40:42.203
I don't belong here.

01:40:42.787 --> 01:40:46.541
I couldn't play
for the Hoffmeisters either, remember?

01:40:49.627 --> 01:40:51.046
You were thinking of Frantz.

01:40:51.921 --> 01:40:52.922
Right?

01:40:55.884 --> 01:40:57.594
I wasn't thinking of Frantz.

01:41:00.263 --> 01:41:01.848
I was thinking of you, Adrien.

01:41:03.433 --> 01:41:04.267
Me?

01:41:05.435 --> 01:41:07.187
You really don't get it.

01:41:09.230 --> 01:41:11.232
Anna, wait. Calm down.

01:41:11.316 --> 01:41:13.109
Where will you sleep tonight?

01:41:13.193 --> 01:41:16.488
Stay with us.
Leave early in the morning if you like.

01:41:16.571 --> 01:41:18.239
No one is upset with you.

01:41:18.323 --> 01:41:20.366
I'll explain it to them.

01:41:43.515 --> 01:41:44.766
I'm sorry.

01:41:46.351 --> 01:41:47.769
You're right.

01:41:47.852 --> 01:41:49.354
Do what you wish.

01:41:53.399 --> 01:41:54.609
Good night.

01:42:17.549 --> 01:42:19.092
Are you taking her?

01:42:19.175 --> 01:42:20.051
Yes.

01:42:21.010 --> 01:42:22.720
Does Fanny mind?

01:42:22.804 --> 01:42:23.847
No.

01:42:23.930 --> 01:42:25.014
Isn't she jealous?

01:42:25.557 --> 01:42:27.100
She has no reason to be.

01:42:27.183 --> 01:42:29.435
Then why did you invite her?

01:42:29.519 --> 01:42:31.813
She came of her own volition.

01:42:32.564 --> 01:42:35.191
I wasn't born yesterday, you know.

01:42:35.650 --> 01:42:36.943
She came...

01:42:37.986 --> 01:42:40.446
to tell me she forgives me.

01:42:41.072 --> 01:42:43.324
You're so innocent, so naive...

01:42:43.950 --> 01:42:45.785
That's why I love you!

01:42:45.869 --> 01:42:47.829
- Don't touch me.
- But Adrien...

01:42:49.164 --> 01:42:50.331
My darling.

01:42:53.209 --> 01:42:54.460
You're ready.

01:42:54.961 --> 01:42:57.213
Great. I'll get the car.

01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:12.604
You know, Anna, my son is very fragile.

01:43:13.646 --> 01:43:15.273
You mustn't torment him.

01:43:17.984 --> 01:43:20.486
I'm not the one tormenting your son.

01:43:21.279 --> 01:43:22.655
It's Frantz.

01:43:47.639 --> 01:43:49.557
How long have you known Fanny?

01:43:50.558 --> 01:43:51.893
Since childhood.

01:43:51.976 --> 01:43:54.812
We lost touch when I went to Paris.

01:43:55.396 --> 01:43:58.858
But when I returned from the front,
we found each other again.

01:44:00.109 --> 01:44:01.444
She's helped me a lot.

01:44:03.571 --> 01:44:05.365
She lost loved ones too.

01:44:06.074 --> 01:44:08.660
- Her brother.
- Yes.

01:44:09.118 --> 01:44:10.536
I liked him very much.

01:44:18.336 --> 01:44:19.837
You know, Anna...

01:44:21.589 --> 01:44:23.591
My mother wants this marriage.

01:44:25.385 --> 01:44:26.719
It eases her mind.

01:44:28.388 --> 01:44:29.681
As for Fanny...

01:44:30.181 --> 01:44:32.517
She's brave, she's always loved me.

01:44:50.702 --> 01:44:56.958
Would you agree to come to our wedding
a month from now?

01:44:58.376 --> 01:44:59.252
Fanny and I...

01:45:00.128 --> 01:45:01.587
would be delighted.

01:45:04.841 --> 01:45:06.092
I don't think so.

01:45:56.934 --> 01:45:58.269
It's too late.

01:46:09.489 --> 01:46:11.032
Be happy, Anna.

01:46:59.914 --> 01:47:01.541
A letter from Anna.

01:47:02.667 --> 01:47:04.293
- Anna?
- Yes.

01:47:14.512 --> 01:47:16.097
“My dear parents...

01:47:16.722 --> 01:47:18.683
I'm writing you from Paris,

01:47:18.766 --> 01:47:21.352
where I've finally found Adrien.

01:47:22.270 --> 01:47:27.108
He's doing well and sends his love.

01:47:27.191 --> 01:47:32.113
He is now first violin
with the Orchestre de Paris.

01:47:32.196 --> 01:47:36.534
I go to the Opéra every night
to hear him play.

01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:38.828
For private recitals,

01:47:38.911 --> 01:47:42.248
he sometimes asks me
to accompany him on piano.

01:47:43.332 --> 01:47:47.545
We're having a marvelous time.

01:47:47.628 --> 01:47:49.755
He's taking me around Paris,

01:47:49.839 --> 01:47:51.674
to all the places...

01:47:52.717 --> 01:47:55.219
Frantz told us about.

01:47:56.220 --> 01:47:58.222
Yesterday, at the Louvre...

01:47:58.848 --> 01:48:01.267
we saw the Manet paintings.

01:48:03.269 --> 01:48:06.856
How I wish you could be here

01:48:06.939 --> 01:48:09.567
to share these moments with us.

01:48:10.693 --> 01:48:13.571
<i>I don't know when I'll be home.</i>

01:48:14.363 --> 01:48:16.616
<i>I'm happy in Paris...</i>

01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:21.579
<i>the city Frantz loved so much.</i>

01:48:21.662 --> 01:48:23.998
<i>Take good care of yourselves.</i>

01:48:26.918 --> 01:48:28.377
<i>All my love.</i>

01:48:28.461 --> 01:48:29.712
<i>Your Anna.”</i>

01:49:02.119 --> 01:49:03.788
You like this painting too?

01:49:09.460 --> 01:49:10.378
Yes.

01:49:12.004 --> 01:49:14.090
It makes me want to live.
