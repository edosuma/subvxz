00:01.210 --> 00:03.176
Last season on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

00:03.179 --> 00:05.759
I'm no longer the captain. You are.

00:05.762 --> 00:07.777
Permission to depart, Captain Lance.

00:07.779 --> 00:10.614
I know that I'm supposed
to go back to 1942.

00:10.616 --> 00:13.283
I have to believe that
time is stronger than that.

00:13.285 --> 00:14.818
It's a timequake.

00:14.820 --> 00:16.653
The result of us
interacting with ourselves.

00:16.655 --> 00:19.222
And whose bright idea
was it to do the one thing

00:19.224 --> 00:21.057
that could jeopardize all of time?

00:21.059 --> 00:22.059
Yours.

00:25.453 --> 00:27.253
Guys.

00:27.256 --> 00:28.989
I think we broke time.

00:35.273 --> 00:37.540
I guess this means
we're not going to Aruba.

00:37.542 --> 00:38.842
You said you broke time.

00:38.844 --> 00:40.944
No, I said we broke time.

00:40.946 --> 00:42.712
Yep, but it was your idea.

00:42.714 --> 00:45.649
No, my idea was to save
reality and save Amaya.

00:45.651 --> 00:47.651
By violating the first
rule of time travel:

00:47.653 --> 00:49.353
never visit the same
time and place twice,

00:49.356 --> 00:50.687
thereby breaking time.

00:50.689 --> 00:52.255
Perhaps we should continue this argument

00:52.257 --> 00:53.717
somewhere there aren't dinosaurs.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.358
Whoa. Big Ben.

00:55.360 --> 00:56.275
So what?

00:56.278 --> 00:57.244
Guys.

00:57.247 --> 00:58.588
I always wanted to visit it.

00:58.591 --> 01:00.057
Guys!

01:04.763 --> 01:06.529
Amaya, talk to it.

01:06.532 --> 01:08.405
- She can talk dinosaur?
- Like you wouldn't believe.

01:08.407 --> 01:10.206
Please speed up that conversation...

01:17.315 --> 01:19.149
Y'all just saw that, right?

01:20.385 --> 01:22.118
And that.

01:22.120 --> 01:23.653
Well, you really have

01:23.655 --> 01:25.588
buggered everything up this time.

01:25.590 --> 01:27.023
Her idea.

01:27.025 --> 01:28.525
No matter. As you can see,

01:28.527 --> 01:31.318
my agents are already hard at work

01:31.321 --> 01:33.327
dealing with these Anachronisms.

01:33.330 --> 01:34.529
Anachronisms?

01:34.532 --> 01:35.829
People, places, and things

01:35.832 --> 01:37.767
displaced from their
native time periods.

01:37.769 --> 01:39.436
I told you I was leaving to create

01:39.438 --> 01:41.705
an organization to
replace the Time Masters.

01:41.707 --> 01:44.574
- 15 minutes ago.
- For you.

01:44.576 --> 01:46.209
Forming the Time
Bureau has been the work

01:46.211 --> 01:48.478
of the last five years of my life.

01:53.652 --> 01:56.086
I've gotten quite good
at it, I'd have to say.

01:56.088 --> 01:57.854
You mean you have Time Agents at work

01:57.856 --> 01:59.522
in the Cretaceous Period as we speak?

01:59.524 --> 02:01.024
Indeed, and throughout
Los Angeles, making sure

02:01.026 --> 02:02.792
no one retains any memory of this...

02:02.794 --> 02:05.495
unfortunate incident.

02:05.497 --> 02:09.199
Which is why your services
are no longer required.

02:10.133 --> 02:11.564
Whoa. What?

02:11.567 --> 02:13.369
It seems only fitting,
since I was the one

02:13.371 --> 02:14.804
who brought this team together

02:14.806 --> 02:16.606
that I should be the one to disband it.

02:16.608 --> 02:18.408
So...

02:18.410 --> 02:20.844
On behalf of the Time Bureau,

02:20.846 --> 02:24.481
I hereby relieve the Legends from duty.

02:43.668 --> 02:45.101
This isn't auditions

02:45.103 --> 02:47.704
for "American Ninja Warrior," you know.

02:47.706 --> 02:49.239
And how many times have I told you

02:49.241 --> 02:51.741
not to play with the merchandise?

02:51.743 --> 02:53.320
Oh, I know that look.

02:53.323 --> 02:54.844
It's the look of someone who thinks

02:54.846 --> 02:56.713
they could have gotten a better job.

02:56.715 --> 02:58.481
Well, let me tell you
something, freckles,

02:58.483 --> 02:59.816
you're lucky I even hired someone

02:59.818 --> 03:02.385
who had been reported dead... twice.

03:02.387 --> 03:05.012
Especially in this economy.

03:05.015 --> 03:06.214
What?

03:06.217 --> 03:07.614
No thank you?

03:09.000 --> 03:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:20.372 --> 03:22.438
Thank you.

03:22.440 --> 03:23.673
That's better.

03:23.675 --> 03:25.375
Now get over to Health and Beauty.

03:25.377 --> 03:27.844
Somebody just spilled a
whole mess of conditioner.

03:36.883 --> 03:39.010
_

03:41.960 --> 03:43.827
Whoo.

03:44.863 --> 03:46.396
Alan...

03:47.866 --> 03:50.166
Alan, um, I've had a breakthrough.

03:50.168 --> 03:51.768
I have told you not to interrupt me

03:51.770 --> 03:53.536
- when I'm plugged in.
- Yes. No, I know

03:53.538 --> 03:55.271
that's very important to you, but, um,

03:55.273 --> 03:57.574
Alan, I've been working
on this side project.

03:57.576 --> 03:59.709
Not only have I managed
to shrink organic matter,

03:59.711 --> 04:02.306
but I've also streamlined the
technology so that you can wear...

04:02.309 --> 04:03.913
I'm not interested, brah.

04:03.915 --> 04:05.648
Look, I-I get it. Once upon a time,

04:05.650 --> 04:07.562
you were "Ray Palmer, tech mogul."

04:07.565 --> 04:09.118
But when you give
your company to a woman

04:09.120 --> 04:10.453
who runs it into the ground,

04:10.455 --> 04:12.589
you lose all side-project privileges.

04:12.591 --> 04:13.890
Great news for you, though,

04:13.892 --> 04:15.291
what we're doing here at Upswipz

04:15.293 --> 04:17.192
is trying to change the world.

04:18.430 --> 04:19.995
Upswipz is a dating app.

04:19.998 --> 04:21.531
Just like Tinder, except you

04:21.533 --> 04:22.999
swipe up-down instead of left-right.

04:23.001 --> 04:25.001
Which is far more intuitive.

04:25.003 --> 04:27.003
And Upswipz isn't a dating app.

04:27.005 --> 04:28.538
It's a holistic social networking...

04:28.540 --> 04:30.073
Social networking platform.

04:30.075 --> 04:31.307
Ah, but, Alan,

04:31.309 --> 04:32.876
my miniaturization technology

04:32.878 --> 04:34.377
has the potential to actually

04:34.379 --> 04:36.512
make the world a better place.

04:36.514 --> 04:37.947
If that were true,

04:37.949 --> 04:39.315
it'd be an app.

04:39.317 --> 04:41.184
If it doesn't live in a phone,

04:41.186 --> 04:43.419
it's not the future, Ray.

04:46.992 --> 04:49.025
Well, I've actually been to the future.

04:49.027 --> 04:51.027
Like, three times.

04:51.029 --> 04:53.314
_

05:15.353 --> 05:16.819
Damn it, Wally.

05:16.821 --> 05:18.021
What did I say?

05:18.023 --> 05:20.189
Ah, I was supposed to save

05:20.191 --> 05:21.435
some of the bad guys for you.

05:21.443 --> 05:22.759
Just a few.

05:22.761 --> 05:24.227
You know what? I'll make it up to you.

05:24.229 --> 05:25.782
The first round is on me.

05:25.785 --> 05:29.299
No. Thanks, man, we're good.

05:29.301 --> 05:31.734
I actually have a girl waiting for me.

05:31.736 --> 05:33.503
Next time.

05:40.645 --> 05:42.745
Hey.

05:42.747 --> 05:43.856
Sorry I'm late.

05:43.859 --> 05:45.315
There was a...

05:45.317 --> 05:46.849
Kind of a work thing.

05:46.851 --> 05:48.985
- It's okay.
- Um...

05:48.987 --> 05:50.954
I know a really great coffee place...

05:52.357 --> 05:55.358
Um... Alana.

05:55.360 --> 05:57.627
_

05:57.629 --> 05:59.595
- Hey, girl.
- Hi.

06:09.174 --> 06:10.773
Hey, idiot.

06:10.775 --> 06:12.875
Either refill my margarita,

06:12.877 --> 06:14.243
or get out of my light.

06:14.245 --> 06:16.879
This is a private beach.

06:16.881 --> 06:18.581
Listen, pal, what did I...

06:21.853 --> 06:24.226
And who the hell are you supposed to be?

06:24.229 --> 06:27.223
I am Gaius Julius Caesar of Rome.

06:27.225 --> 06:28.758
Oh.

06:28.760 --> 06:31.194
Thought I recognized you.

06:31.196 --> 06:32.908
I knocked off one of your casinos

06:32.911 --> 06:34.364
in Vegas.

06:34.366 --> 06:36.833
I am here to conquer
all the known world.

06:36.835 --> 06:38.835
Right.

06:38.837 --> 06:40.236
Wait a sec.

06:40.238 --> 06:41.704
How did you get here?

06:41.706 --> 06:43.039
I imagine through the mischief

06:43.041 --> 06:45.308
of the goddess Ate.

06:45.310 --> 06:48.611
But it matters not the
land I find myself in.

06:48.613 --> 06:51.388
It is but a matter of time
before my banner flies over it.

06:53.318 --> 06:54.820
Is that a fact?

07:01.726 --> 07:02.925
Yeah?

07:02.927 --> 07:05.028
Boss.

07:05.030 --> 07:07.430
- Rory?
- I got a situation.

07:07.432 --> 07:09.232
I think I bumped into one of those

07:09.234 --> 07:11.034
mechanisms...

07:11.036 --> 07:12.101
Mechanism?

07:12.103 --> 07:13.169
A nagging-ism.

07:13.171 --> 07:14.804
Anachronism?

07:14.806 --> 07:15.972
Yes.

07:15.974 --> 07:18.441
Julius Caesar...

07:18.443 --> 07:19.809
is in Aruba.

07:19.811 --> 07:22.245
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

07:22.247 --> 07:24.269
I got him tied up in my casita.

07:24.272 --> 07:25.771
What do you want me to do?

07:25.774 --> 07:27.640
Just sit tight and keep him safe.

07:27.643 --> 07:29.529
If you screw up history, the
Bureau will be on your ass

07:29.531 --> 07:31.120
before you can say...

07:31.122 --> 07:32.455
Son of a bitch.

07:32.457 --> 07:33.956
Are you taking a personal call

07:33.958 --> 07:35.491
during peak consumer traffic?

07:35.493 --> 07:36.726
No.

07:39.230 --> 07:40.897
'Cause I quit.

07:46.049 --> 07:47.836
_

07:50.275 --> 07:51.874
All right.

07:51.876 --> 07:53.709
What's so important to
make you catch a train

07:53.711 --> 07:54.744
to Central City?

07:54.746 --> 07:56.746
Where's Amaya?

07:56.748 --> 07:58.314
We kind of broke up.

07:58.316 --> 08:00.683
- What?
- It's not a big deal.

08:00.685 --> 08:02.785
So what's going on?

08:02.787 --> 08:04.921
Rory found an Anachronism.

08:04.923 --> 08:07.690
Apparently, Julius Caesar
just wound up in Aruba.

08:07.692 --> 08:08.825
Mick's got him all tied up.

08:08.827 --> 08:10.426
Look, this is our chance

08:10.428 --> 08:12.628
to get the Time Bureau
to deal us back in.

08:12.630 --> 08:14.263
Look, if we pull this off,

08:14.265 --> 08:16.165
Rip might give us our old ship back.

08:16.167 --> 08:17.733
Wow, I had no idea

08:17.735 --> 08:20.036
you were so unhappy with your new life.

08:21.339 --> 08:23.172
Are you kidding me?

08:23.174 --> 08:25.441
I'm, uh... I'm... I'm loving it.

08:25.443 --> 08:27.110
I'm doing really good work.

08:27.112 --> 08:29.378
It says you work at Sink Shower & Stuff.

08:30.448 --> 08:31.948
Yeah, well...

08:31.950 --> 08:34.616
even vigilantes have to pay their bills.

08:34.619 --> 08:36.352
What are you guys so content with, huh?

08:36.354 --> 08:37.587
What are you doing?

08:38.857 --> 08:40.857
I'm doing pretty good.
Thanks for asking.

08:40.859 --> 08:42.792
I am...

08:42.794 --> 08:46.229
The second most popular superhero

08:46.231 --> 08:48.064
in Central City.

08:48.066 --> 08:50.600
So that's... pretty good.

08:50.602 --> 08:53.397
Well, I am the first most
popular in Silicon Valley,

08:53.400 --> 08:56.539
when I'm not changing
the world with a...

08:56.541 --> 08:59.509
Holistic social networking platform.

09:03.781 --> 09:04.981
Let's go.

09:04.983 --> 09:06.682
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank God.

09:13.858 --> 09:15.958
You sure this is where they're at?

09:15.960 --> 09:18.947
I bumped into one of Rip's
Time Agents a while back.

09:18.950 --> 09:21.697
He may have left his badge at my place.

09:21.699 --> 09:23.633
He left it at your place?

09:25.916 --> 09:27.970
All right, maybe I lifted it off of him

09:27.972 --> 09:29.805
in the morning.

09:41.686 --> 09:43.629
- Freeze!
- Hands in the air!

09:43.632 --> 09:44.777
Eyes on, eyes on!

09:44.780 --> 09:46.043
Hey, don't move!

09:46.046 --> 09:47.557
Stay right there!

09:49.127 --> 09:51.027
Hello, everyone.

09:51.029 --> 09:52.728
Welcome.

09:52.730 --> 09:54.697
On the floor. Hands behind your heads.

09:54.699 --> 09:57.066
Uh, sorry, there must
be some kind of mistake.

09:57.068 --> 09:58.167
We're the... we're the...

09:58.169 --> 10:00.836
Legends! Oh!

10:02.440 --> 10:04.707
Oh, we know exactly who you losers are.

10:09.220 --> 10:11.801
Wow, this floor is, like, super clean.

10:11.804 --> 10:14.438
Lady, why are you so mean?

10:14.440 --> 10:16.039
Maybe it's that poly-blend pantsuit

10:16.041 --> 10:17.509
that's got her so grumpy.

10:17.512 --> 10:19.810
I didn't know Men's Wearhouse
gave group discounts.

10:19.812 --> 10:21.612
What's wrong with you people?
Do you want to get shot?

10:21.614 --> 10:23.694
Totally rather get shot
than look like a Sears model.

10:24.783 --> 10:25.983
Hold your fire!

10:25.985 --> 10:27.751
Stand down! All of you.

10:27.753 --> 10:29.186
Excuse me.

10:29.188 --> 10:32.089
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

10:32.091 --> 10:34.858
Hello. So good to see you all.

10:34.860 --> 10:36.593
Next time, just call ahead.

10:36.595 --> 10:38.529
You son of a bitch.

10:38.531 --> 10:40.030
Eyes on, eyes on!

10:40.033 --> 10:41.766
There's been a slight misunderstanding,

10:41.769 --> 10:42.678
Dr. Heywood.

10:42.681 --> 10:44.468
Nate, what are you doing?

10:44.470 --> 10:46.770
I want to hear Rip say it.

10:46.772 --> 10:49.039
You told Amaya to go back to 1942.

10:49.041 --> 10:50.841
Amaya went back to 1942?

10:50.843 --> 10:53.300
It was her idea.

10:53.303 --> 10:56.441
She wanted to go back home to Zambesi.

10:58.035 --> 10:59.568
What'd you say?

10:59.571 --> 11:01.312
It was Amaya's idea
to go back to Zambesi.

11:01.315 --> 11:03.415
No, I heard him, Ray.

11:03.418 --> 11:05.322
I was just being rhetorical.

11:08.360 --> 11:10.827
All right. This is just awkward.

11:10.829 --> 11:13.193
So...

11:13.196 --> 11:15.265
what brings the rest of
you to the Time Bureau?

11:15.267 --> 11:16.533
We found an Anachronism.

11:16.535 --> 11:17.901
I wasn't aware any of you

11:17.903 --> 11:19.269
were searching for Anachronisms.

11:19.271 --> 11:20.470
We weren't.

11:20.472 --> 11:21.939
Rory was on a bender

11:21.941 --> 11:23.540
when Julius Caesar showed up.

11:23.542 --> 11:25.242
Agent Sharp, have we seen

11:25.244 --> 11:26.743
any activity that would match

11:26.745 --> 11:28.468
such a massive historical displacement?

11:28.471 --> 11:29.780
Absolutely not, sir.

11:29.782 --> 11:32.404
Well, I guess you must
have missed one then.

11:32.407 --> 11:34.551
I find that very hard to
believe, and you know what...

11:34.553 --> 11:36.587
Ready a go-team...

11:36.589 --> 11:39.356
and we will meet you at the Op-Center.

11:39.358 --> 11:41.391
Sir.

11:41.393 --> 11:43.260
In the meantime...

11:44.630 --> 11:45.929
Who fancies a tour?

11:55.841 --> 11:57.674
Guess they're, uh,

11:57.676 --> 11:59.509
not used to seeing famous people.

11:59.511 --> 12:01.311
Yeah, kind of like we're
the Founding Fathers

12:01.313 --> 12:02.646
of the Time Bureau.

12:02.648 --> 12:03.890
In a way.

12:03.893 --> 12:05.782
I suppose if you lot hadn't created

12:05.784 --> 12:08.151
the greatest time paradox
the world had ever known,

12:08.153 --> 12:09.853
all of these people
would have nothing to do.

12:09.855 --> 12:11.488
Unhand me, you knave!

12:11.490 --> 12:12.856
Is that...?

12:12.858 --> 12:14.925
Oh, yeah. King Arthur.

12:16.172 --> 12:18.061
His displacement into
the Spanish Civil War

12:18.063 --> 12:19.896
caused quite the Anachronism.

12:19.898 --> 12:22.065
Ah, evil sorcerer!

12:22.067 --> 12:24.434
I might have known you were
responsible for all of this.

12:25.945 --> 12:27.871
Now when he's returned
to his original time,

12:27.873 --> 12:30.207
he will have no memory
of his displacement.

12:30.209 --> 12:31.842
All humility aside,

12:31.844 --> 12:35.445
we are the most important
security organization...

12:35.447 --> 12:37.381
That no one's ever heard of.

12:37.383 --> 12:39.516
Who somehow missed the
fact that Julius Caesar

12:39.518 --> 12:41.518
is down in Aruba working on his tan.

12:41.520 --> 12:42.886
I'm sure our detection system

12:42.888 --> 12:44.955
would have picked up
on his displacement.

12:44.957 --> 12:46.823
Hm.

12:46.825 --> 12:48.830
Yeah, and we get that,

12:48.833 --> 12:51.294
but all we're saying is,
if you wanted to give us

12:51.296 --> 12:53.163
the old Waverider
back, we would be happy

12:53.165 --> 12:55.465
to go down there and
take care of it for you.

12:55.467 --> 12:57.734
Yeah, you know, for...
For old time's sake?

13:08.814 --> 13:12.416
I'm sorry, but our old ship
has been put to new use.

13:24.296 --> 13:27.364
You turned our ship into a simulator?

13:27.366 --> 13:29.533
The Command Module is heading
toward a meteoroid belt.

13:29.535 --> 13:31.935
Apollo 13 astronauts will
die unless we do something.

13:31.937 --> 13:33.213
Aw, that's cool, man.

13:33.216 --> 13:34.771
They're teaching one
of our old missions.

13:34.773 --> 13:35.906
I've got an idea.

13:35.908 --> 13:37.074
Why don't we swing around

13:37.076 --> 13:38.408
and use our ship as a shield?

13:38.410 --> 13:40.744
- Boom.
- Kidding.

13:40.746 --> 13:42.746
I'm not a total idiot.

13:42.748 --> 13:45.950
Target the Command Module's
oxygen tank with our photons,

13:45.953 --> 13:47.518
and fire.

13:50.089 --> 13:52.055
- Yes!
- The ruptured tank

13:52.057 --> 13:54.491
propelled their capsule
out of harm's way, Captain.

13:56.762 --> 13:58.261
Well done, class.

13:58.263 --> 13:59.830
See you all tomorrow.

13:59.832 --> 14:01.131
We'll see how you do

14:01.133 --> 14:02.766
trying to stop an atomic torpedo

14:02.768 --> 14:04.367
from blowing up New York City.

14:09.174 --> 14:10.874
What are they doing here?

14:10.876 --> 14:13.076
We are here to help you.

14:13.078 --> 14:15.345
That's very gracious of you.

14:15.347 --> 14:18.247
But whatever it is,
we have professionals

14:18.250 --> 14:19.622
who can handle the matter.

14:19.625 --> 14:22.919
Along with whatever
damage Mr. Rory causes.

14:26.191 --> 14:27.778
Your salad sucks.

14:27.781 --> 14:29.793
You should know this
is not the first time

14:29.795 --> 14:31.795
I've been taken captive.

14:31.797 --> 14:34.431
Oh, great, a story.

14:34.433 --> 14:37.400
Once, when I was a young man,

14:37.402 --> 14:40.303
I was kidnapped by pirates.

14:40.305 --> 14:44.040
They ransomed me for
50 talents of silver,

14:44.042 --> 14:45.776
a fortune.

14:45.778 --> 14:48.845
My family paid the money, of course.

14:48.847 --> 14:50.480
But I told my captors

14:50.482 --> 14:52.449
they would be better off killing me.

14:52.451 --> 14:54.618
Because if they did let me go,

14:54.620 --> 14:57.187
I promised to come back one day,

14:57.189 --> 14:59.322
and not only to take my silver,

14:59.324 --> 15:03.357
but to crucify the pirates one by one.

15:03.360 --> 15:05.227
And that's exactly what I did.

15:05.230 --> 15:07.130
You saying I should kill you?

15:07.132 --> 15:10.967
You should believe me
when I make a promise.

15:10.969 --> 15:13.935
The gold in this satchel...

15:13.938 --> 15:15.138
is yours.

15:15.140 --> 15:16.573
Gold?

15:16.575 --> 15:20.010
But I swear by my household gods,

15:20.012 --> 15:22.179
it will cost you your life.

15:22.181 --> 15:24.147
Oh.

15:33.592 --> 15:35.792
Do we have a location on Mr. Rory?

15:35.794 --> 15:38.495
Mm, we followed a trail
of petty larceny reports.

15:38.497 --> 15:39.863
He's been holed up on the beach,

15:39.865 --> 15:41.364
running up a room service tab

15:41.366 --> 15:43.934
and a serious collection of STDs.

15:43.936 --> 15:46.269
- That's our Mick.
- He's been busy.

15:49.474 --> 15:51.605
Locking in on coordinates now.

15:51.608 --> 15:53.240
Is the go-team ready?

15:53.243 --> 15:54.878
Locked and loaded, sir.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.513
Opening a portal.

16:06.668 --> 16:08.391
You broke my nose.

16:23.408 --> 16:24.997
Out of my way!

16:29.748 --> 16:31.915
- Our team is under attack.
- Definitely Rory.

16:31.917 --> 16:34.551
Alpha team, do you have eyes on Caesar?

16:34.553 --> 16:35.852
He's got the target.

16:35.854 --> 16:37.254
What do you want us to do, Command?

16:37.256 --> 16:38.569
Get the hell out of there

16:38.572 --> 16:40.857
before Mr. Rory causes any more mayhem.

16:40.859 --> 16:42.692
Roger that. Initiating extraction.

16:42.694 --> 16:44.728
Get off me, you damn missionaries!

16:51.602 --> 16:53.332
Get the hell off me, dude.

16:53.335 --> 16:55.168
This is Julius Caesar?

16:55.171 --> 16:56.671
Dude, my dad's a lawyer.

16:56.674 --> 16:58.375
I'm going to totally
sue all of your asses.

16:59.444 --> 17:00.744
What is this place?

17:00.746 --> 17:02.245
An institution you will never

17:02.247 --> 17:04.114
step foot in again, Mr. Rory.

17:04.117 --> 17:06.050
Get them out of here!

17:08.946 --> 17:11.054
Rip, look. I'm sorry.

17:11.056 --> 17:13.690
- I thought that this...
- The Legends would change?

17:13.692 --> 17:15.659
Since when do we need to change?

17:15.661 --> 17:16.960
When you left our team, you said

17:16.962 --> 17:18.895
you had nothing left to teach me.

17:18.896 --> 17:20.829
Yes, well, unfortunately all of history

17:20.832 --> 17:22.054
suddenly came unglued

17:22.057 --> 17:23.900
moments after I'd uttered those words.

17:23.902 --> 17:27.337
Look, I miss the good old days too, Sara.

17:27.339 --> 17:28.848
But times have changed.

17:28.851 --> 17:32.709
Yeah, and you don't
think you need us anymore.

17:32.711 --> 17:34.344
Look, Rip.

17:34.346 --> 17:37.914
This is our mess. You
have to let us fix it.

17:37.916 --> 17:40.850
Using your team to fix anything...

17:40.852 --> 17:43.820
is like doing brain
surgery with a chainsaw.

17:51.063 --> 17:53.363
Whoa. You can't leave yet.

17:54.533 --> 17:56.566
Not without parking validation.

18:01.173 --> 18:03.873
Son of a bitch stole my money.

18:07.879 --> 18:09.612
Whoa.

18:09.614 --> 18:11.514
This is a genuine Roman aureus.

18:11.516 --> 18:13.683
This is first century B.C.

18:13.685 --> 18:15.739
That means Rory really
saw Julius Caesar.

18:15.742 --> 18:16.640
Duh.

18:16.643 --> 18:18.250
We've got to tell Rip that
he's got the wrong guy.

18:18.252 --> 18:19.688
Yeah, like he'll listen to us.

18:19.691 --> 18:20.919
He's right.

18:20.922 --> 18:22.655
We've got to grab Caesar ourselves.

18:22.658 --> 18:25.528
And prove to Rip that
we got the right stuff.

18:25.530 --> 18:26.730
Sara.

18:26.732 --> 18:27.831
Exit's this way.

18:27.833 --> 18:29.466
Our ship's this way.

18:29.468 --> 18:30.967
We're gonna steal the Waverider?

18:30.969 --> 18:33.536
We're gonna fix our mistakes.

18:42.214 --> 18:44.264
Oh, damn it! I mean, darn it.

18:44.267 --> 18:46.683
There's a class in session.

18:46.685 --> 18:48.585
Ah.

18:48.587 --> 18:49.853
Listen up, punks.

18:49.855 --> 18:52.655
Class dismissed. Get out of here.

18:52.657 --> 18:54.858
This must be a part of
the training exercise.

18:56.272 --> 18:58.294
Our ship has been
boarded by a Time Pirate.

18:58.296 --> 18:59.996
On behalf of The Time
Bureau, and in accordance

18:59.998 --> 19:02.198
to Article 15.6, Section B,

19:02.200 --> 19:04.300
concerning the unlawful
seizure of Time Ships...

19:07.072 --> 19:08.371
Anyone else?

19:09.925 --> 19:11.724
Gideon's been in sleep
mode for five years,

19:11.727 --> 19:14.544
but if I can divert her
power back to the core...

19:14.546 --> 19:16.479
Hello, Legends. What did I miss?

19:16.481 --> 19:18.214
Well, we're about to steal the ship,

19:18.216 --> 19:19.849
go grab Julius Caesar in Aruba,

19:19.851 --> 19:22.152
all before history completely collapses.

19:22.154 --> 19:24.154
So it's business as usual, then.

19:24.156 --> 19:25.488
Exactly.

19:25.490 --> 19:27.290
Gideon, engines to power.

19:27.292 --> 19:28.568
Turbines to speed.

19:28.571 --> 19:30.505
Right away, Captain.

19:33.565 --> 19:36.332
Sounds like this old
boat needs a lube job.

19:40.459 --> 19:42.559
What in the hell do
they think they're doing?

19:42.562 --> 19:44.441
The hangar's sealed.
There's no way out of here.

19:44.443 --> 19:45.909
Yep, well, I'm afraid the Legends

19:45.911 --> 19:47.710
have never permitted
something like logic

19:47.712 --> 19:49.779
to stop them.

19:56.855 --> 19:59.222
I hope you know what
you're doing, Ms. Lance.

19:59.224 --> 20:01.458
Gideon, time-jump us out of here.

20:01.460 --> 20:03.793
Uh, are you sure we can
time-jump inside the building?

20:03.795 --> 20:05.662
We're about to find out.

20:24.596 --> 20:26.429
Gideon, when are we?

20:26.431 --> 20:27.898
I was only able to time-jump us

20:27.900 --> 20:29.332
three minutes into the future.

20:29.334 --> 20:30.917
We're still in Star City.

20:30.920 --> 20:32.502
If you haven't noticed,

20:32.504 --> 20:34.571
the ship is in desperate
need of maintenance.

20:34.573 --> 20:36.806
Yeah, there's no way we're
gonna make it to Aruba.

20:36.808 --> 20:39.482
Can we make it to Central City?

20:39.485 --> 20:41.118
I know a good mechanic there.

20:47.015 --> 20:50.153
Jefferson. What a...
what a nice surprise.

20:50.155 --> 20:52.689
Lily also dropped by with
some rather exciting news.

20:52.691 --> 20:54.824
Oh, well, if it's a bad
time, I can always just...

20:54.826 --> 20:56.459
Wait, wait. What is it?

20:56.461 --> 20:57.884
Something's wrong. I can feel it.

20:57.887 --> 20:59.229
We may only see each other

20:59.231 --> 21:00.830
once a week for our bonding sessions,

21:00.832 --> 21:02.999
but we still share a psychic connection.

21:04.937 --> 21:06.469
I dropped out of school.

21:06.471 --> 21:07.864
Why would you do that?

21:07.867 --> 21:10.307
You could have your
master's in... in two years.

21:10.309 --> 21:11.658
Yeah, I know, it's just...

21:11.661 --> 21:13.361
Learning about engineering

21:13.364 --> 21:15.197
is not half as fun
as actually, you know,

21:15.200 --> 21:16.633
being an engineer...

21:16.636 --> 21:17.802
on a time ship.

21:17.805 --> 21:19.438
Oh, hey, Jax.

21:20.821 --> 21:23.288
Whoa. Whoa, Lily, you're...

21:23.290 --> 21:24.522
You're...

21:24.524 --> 21:25.690
What?

21:25.692 --> 21:27.158
I'm what?

21:27.160 --> 21:28.860
Uh, you... you look... You look healthy.

21:28.862 --> 21:30.128
I'm kidding. I'm pregnant.

21:30.130 --> 21:31.729
Oh, my God.

21:31.731 --> 21:34.332
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

21:34.334 --> 21:37.235
Yeah, I was on sabbatical in
Rome with my boyfriend and...

21:37.237 --> 21:39.070
She means her future husband.

21:39.072 --> 21:41.573
And we decided we wanted to come home

21:41.575 --> 21:43.441
and break the big news in person.

21:45.024 --> 21:47.250
Oh, I've got to put the
osso buco in the oven,

21:47.253 --> 21:48.804
but you should totally
stay for dinner...

21:48.806 --> 21:49.871
Right, daddy?

21:49.874 --> 21:51.474
- Yeah.
- Okay.

21:52.619 --> 21:54.385
Dude. What?

21:54.387 --> 21:57.088
My heart still melts
when she says that word.

21:57.090 --> 21:58.656
It's crazy. It's...

22:01.361 --> 22:03.795
Oh, my God.

22:04.931 --> 22:07.121
Is that what I think it is?

22:08.704 --> 22:10.270
Come on, Grey.

22:10.273 --> 22:13.634
A chance to meet Julius
Caesar and fix history.

22:13.637 --> 22:16.274
Look, we have a time ship.

22:16.276 --> 22:18.243
We can get you home in time for dessert.

22:18.245 --> 22:20.240
That's what I told Clarissa
the last time I left.

22:20.243 --> 22:23.047
And when you came home you
had a surprise daughter.

22:23.049 --> 22:25.091
- Mm?
- Your point?

22:25.094 --> 22:26.894
The point is, sometimes...

22:26.897 --> 22:28.753
we screw things up for the better.

22:28.755 --> 22:30.154
That's a good motto.

22:30.156 --> 22:31.489
We should use that.

22:32.459 --> 22:34.259
Fine, whatever.

22:34.261 --> 22:35.426
I'll... I'll come. Great.

22:35.429 --> 22:37.145
Now all we need is Amaya,

22:37.148 --> 22:38.897
and we can get the band back together.

22:38.899 --> 22:41.099
- That's not happening.
- Whoa, did I miss something?

22:41.102 --> 22:42.934
- Mm-mm.
- Amaya dumped him.

22:42.936 --> 22:44.502
Went back to 1942.

22:44.504 --> 22:46.304
She didn't dump me.

22:46.383 --> 22:47.906
She didn't dump me.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.841
Amaya went back to Zambesi
because Rip told her

22:49.843 --> 22:51.175
she has some sort of destiny to fulfill

22:51.177 --> 22:52.977
back in 1942. That's it.

22:52.979 --> 22:54.379
Unlike the rest of us

22:54.381 --> 22:56.247
who don't have crap

22:56.249 --> 22:57.615
waiting for us in the real world.

22:57.617 --> 22:59.417
Speak for yourself, numbnuts.

22:59.419 --> 23:01.252
I don't know about you
all, but I was destined

23:01.254 --> 23:03.021
for greater things than folding towels.

23:03.023 --> 23:04.355
And Rip thinks he doesn't need us

23:04.357 --> 23:05.626
because he's got the Time Bureau.

23:05.628 --> 23:06.724
Ray's right.

23:06.726 --> 23:08.126
We're the ones who broke history.

23:08.128 --> 23:09.994
We should be the ones that fix it.

23:09.996 --> 23:12.697
But instead of operating
on history with a chainsaw,

23:12.699 --> 23:16.901
this time we are gonna be the scalpel.

23:18.338 --> 23:19.671
Is this your idea of subtle?

23:19.673 --> 23:21.506
Just try to blend in, okay?

23:21.508 --> 23:23.441
No problem.

23:23.443 --> 23:25.443
Great Caesar's ghost.

23:25.445 --> 23:26.811
That's him.

23:26.813 --> 23:28.613
So what I have to say to you is this:

23:28.615 --> 23:30.823
are you willing to fight with me?

23:30.826 --> 23:32.292
Yeah!

23:32.295 --> 23:34.719
And claim this savage land for Rome?

23:34.721 --> 23:36.254
Yeah!

23:36.256 --> 23:38.323
What, did you teach Caesar English?

23:38.325 --> 23:41.059
Nope. Just showed up speaking fancy.

23:41.061 --> 23:42.961
Temporal linguistic dysplasia...

23:42.963 --> 23:44.495
- What?
- A side effect

23:44.497 --> 23:45.610
of historical displacement.

23:45.613 --> 23:47.065
Astonishing!

23:47.067 --> 23:48.532
You know, cowards die

23:48.535 --> 23:50.835
many times before their deaths.

23:50.837 --> 23:53.805
The valiant never taste death but once!

23:53.807 --> 23:56.708
Yeah! And Delta Nu Phi sucks!

23:56.710 --> 23:58.476
Delta Nu Phi sucks!

23:58.478 --> 24:00.411
Alpha Psi Gamma sucks!

24:00.413 --> 24:02.347
Delta Nu Phi sucks!

24:02.349 --> 24:04.582
Can we not agree they all suck?

24:04.584 --> 24:05.984
A'ight.

24:05.986 --> 24:07.485
Let's shut this toga party down

24:07.487 --> 24:09.220
before things really get out of hand.

24:09.222 --> 24:10.855
No powers.

24:10.857 --> 24:12.490
It can make the Anachronism worse.

24:12.492 --> 24:14.459
Right, be the scalpel.

24:14.461 --> 24:16.127
Because I saw in you...

24:16.129 --> 24:17.261
I've got an idea.

24:17.263 --> 24:18.882
The makings of a legion.

24:18.885 --> 24:20.632
Come on, man, are you
really trying to hook up now?

24:20.634 --> 24:22.266
No, I'm creating a dating profile

24:22.268 --> 24:23.935
on our new UpSwipz app.

24:23.937 --> 24:25.403
Gideon, I need you to hit

24:25.405 --> 24:27.739
every phone on the beach with a match.

24:27.741 --> 24:29.340
"Exotic beauty looking for

24:29.342 --> 24:31.822
casual sex with young frat stud?"

24:31.825 --> 24:33.411
- That might work.
- Yeah.

24:33.413 --> 24:35.146
Now all I need is a profile picture.

24:35.148 --> 24:36.694
I believe I've got that covered.

24:37.955 --> 24:40.451
Ooh.

24:40.453 --> 24:41.686
Not bad.

24:43.056 --> 24:44.111
For Mars!

24:44.114 --> 24:45.723
- Yeah!
- For Rome!

24:45.725 --> 24:47.158
Yeah!

24:47.160 --> 24:49.260
Death... or glory!

24:57.303 --> 24:59.570
All right, JC. Party's over.

24:59.572 --> 25:00.838
You're coming with us.

25:00.840 --> 25:02.240
I'd rather fall on my sword

25:02.242 --> 25:03.775
than surrender it to a woman.

25:03.777 --> 25:07.345
Well, then today is your lucky day.

25:14.854 --> 25:16.921
Uh, shouldn't we help her?

25:16.923 --> 25:18.389
It's him I'm worried about.

25:23.396 --> 25:24.962
Ooh.

25:24.964 --> 25:27.598
Yep, I'd say our work here is done.

25:27.600 --> 25:30.030
And to quote the great
conqueror himself,

25:30.033 --> 25:31.869
"We came, we saw..."

25:31.871 --> 25:33.905
We kicked Caesar's ass!

25:33.907 --> 25:36.107
- Mm.
- Mm.

25:36.109 --> 25:38.643
- Oh, man.
- Oh.

25:38.645 --> 25:41.312
- Suckers.
- Nice work.

25:41.314 --> 25:42.613
I'd have done it faster.

25:51.803 --> 25:53.684
Oh, I'm sorry.

25:53.687 --> 25:54.949
Did that hurt?

25:54.952 --> 25:56.814
Easy, Mick.

25:56.816 --> 25:58.282
He broke my nose.

25:58.284 --> 26:00.084
My best feature.

26:00.086 --> 26:02.586
Still... we have to get him
back to his time in one piece.

26:02.588 --> 26:04.054
Or he doesn't go on to conquer the world

26:04.056 --> 26:05.256
and help create the greatest empire

26:05.258 --> 26:06.323
history has ever known.

26:06.325 --> 26:07.658
We need to get moving.

26:07.660 --> 26:09.026
It's not gonna take Rip long

26:09.028 --> 26:10.628
to track down a stolen time ship.

26:10.630 --> 26:12.696
Quite so, Ms. Lance.

26:14.066 --> 26:15.566
It appears that you've captured

26:15.568 --> 26:17.835
the real Julius Caesar. Well done.

26:17.837 --> 26:19.405
Now, if you'll just return him to us,

26:19.408 --> 26:21.872
we'll be happy to handle his
reinsertion back into history.

26:21.874 --> 26:23.340
You don't think we can handle it?

26:23.342 --> 26:24.942
It's not that.

26:24.944 --> 26:26.076
Maybe it is that.

26:26.078 --> 26:27.678
But the fact remains

26:27.680 --> 26:29.880
that you have hijacked our property.

26:29.882 --> 26:31.549
And if you would return it to us

26:31.551 --> 26:34.485
along with our anachronistic guest,

26:34.487 --> 26:37.254
all will be forgiven.

26:37.256 --> 26:40.458
I trust you'll use your best judgment.

26:40.460 --> 26:43.461
Does he not know this team?

26:43.463 --> 26:45.496
Shouldn't we entrust Caesar's return

26:45.498 --> 26:47.331
to people who do that sort
of thing professionally?

26:47.333 --> 26:48.833
I thought this was our chance to prove

26:48.835 --> 26:51.802
that we were professional... ish.

26:51.804 --> 26:53.838
Your call, Captain.

26:55.475 --> 26:57.241
Gideon,

26:57.243 --> 26:58.943
plot a course for the Time Bureau.

26:58.945 --> 27:00.611
I'm afraid that won't be possible

27:00.613 --> 27:01.979
without additional repairs.

27:01.981 --> 27:03.848
Of course.

27:05.284 --> 27:07.885
Et tu, Sara?

27:07.887 --> 27:09.520
I'm using my best judgment.

27:18.297 --> 27:20.130
You know, I've taken these engines apart

27:20.132 --> 27:23.434
so many times, feels like
this ship is a part of me.

27:23.436 --> 27:25.494
It is a part of you that you can take on

27:25.497 --> 27:27.830
whatever adventure life offers you next.

27:29.141 --> 27:31.909
What adventure could
be better than this one?

27:31.911 --> 27:35.513
I mean, I got to be a superhero
who traveled through time,

27:35.515 --> 27:37.143
changing history.

27:37.146 --> 27:39.006
Yes, I know.

27:39.009 --> 27:44.021
Look, I know you want to
do the whole granddad thing.

27:44.023 --> 27:46.624
Smoke a pipe by the fire, but...

27:46.626 --> 27:49.426
I got a whole lot of life left,

27:49.428 --> 27:51.962
and I have no idea how to fill it.

27:53.599 --> 27:57.234
Jefferson, you are, hands down,

27:57.236 --> 27:59.937
the most gifted, capable,

27:59.939 --> 28:03.374
Jeffersodriven young
man handsl've ever known.

28:03.376 --> 28:06.310
You can do anything you want to do.

28:06.312 --> 28:07.545
Well, that's all well and good,

28:07.547 --> 28:09.079
but what I want to do is be half

28:09.081 --> 28:11.148
of a nuclear-powered superhero.

28:11.150 --> 28:13.729
And I can't do that
if you don't want to.

28:27.967 --> 28:29.967
Have you come to gloat?

28:29.969 --> 28:33.637
Or to grant me the mercy
of taking my own life?

28:33.639 --> 28:36.663
Getting beaten by a woman
bothers you that much?

28:36.666 --> 28:38.699
Yes.

28:38.702 --> 28:42.604
If your intention is
neither boasting nor mercy,

28:42.607 --> 28:45.842
to what do I owe the
honor of this visit?

28:51.958 --> 28:54.158
You doubt your present course of action

28:54.160 --> 28:55.726
and seem to believe that Caesar

28:55.728 --> 28:57.761
holds the key to resolving it.

28:57.763 --> 28:59.897
There's nothing to resolve.

28:59.899 --> 29:02.266
My course of action isn't up to me.

29:02.268 --> 29:04.134
So you believe your
future lies in the hands

29:04.136 --> 29:05.336
of the Three Fates?

29:05.338 --> 29:06.737
No.

29:06.739 --> 29:09.237
It lies in the hands of a group

29:09.240 --> 29:11.207
called the Time Bureau.

29:11.210 --> 29:13.777
And if I go against them
now, they'll take my ship.

29:13.779 --> 29:15.746
And if I screw this up,

29:15.748 --> 29:17.581
then I lose everything.

29:17.583 --> 29:20.851
And that's all you're willing
to wager for greatness?

29:20.853 --> 29:23.487
Pompey said he would have my head

29:23.489 --> 29:25.956
for going against the Senate...

29:25.958 --> 29:28.559
but when I lead my
army across the Rubicon,

29:28.561 --> 29:32.429
Rome will welcome me as a god.

29:33.566 --> 29:36.367
Well, I wish I shared your confidence.

29:38.671 --> 29:41.071
It cost me eight years
and countless centurions

29:41.073 --> 29:43.386
to conquer Gaul.

29:43.389 --> 29:47.358
But with an Amazonian
queen like you by my side,

29:47.361 --> 29:50.595
I could make short work
of the rest of the world.

29:52.084 --> 29:54.685
Conquering the world does sound nice...

29:56.622 --> 29:58.756
But I don't need you to do it.

30:02.624 --> 30:04.191
Ship's fixed, Cap.

30:04.194 --> 30:07.698
Fixed enough to get us
back to the Time Bureau?

30:07.700 --> 30:09.733
Mm-hmm.

30:09.735 --> 30:12.369
How about ancient Rome?

30:12.371 --> 30:14.371
Only one way to find out.

30:22.154 --> 30:24.681
_

30:24.684 --> 30:26.850
According to Gideon, Caesar disappeared

30:26.852 --> 30:29.219
the night before his
famous march on Rome.

30:29.221 --> 30:31.655
Yeah, no crossing the
Rubicon means no civil war.

30:31.657 --> 30:33.557
No civil war means no Ides of March.

30:33.559 --> 30:34.892
No Ides of March means...

30:34.894 --> 30:36.927
No Roman Empire.

30:36.929 --> 30:38.429
What happens on the Ides of March?

30:38.431 --> 30:40.506
Eh... well, that's when your friends,

30:40.509 --> 30:42.168
who really aren't your friends,

30:42.171 --> 30:44.499
stab you in the back to
stop your rise to power.

30:44.502 --> 30:46.303
Not that you'll remember any of this.

30:51.377 --> 30:54.978
Check it out. History is back to normal.

30:57.183 --> 31:00.766
And now a little something
for the Heywood scrapbook.

31:02.171 --> 31:04.738
Oh, man. That's a keeper.

31:04.741 --> 31:06.757
Enjoy conquering the world.

31:26.445 --> 31:28.278
Perhaps my eyes deceive me,

31:28.280 --> 31:30.414
but that does not look
like the Time Bureau to me.

31:30.416 --> 31:33.283
No, it says here we landed in 49 B.C.

31:33.285 --> 31:37.221
Relax, because we just dropped off JC

31:37.223 --> 31:38.655
back where he belongs.

31:38.657 --> 31:40.457
So, history has been restored,

31:40.459 --> 31:42.893
and we can go home.

31:42.895 --> 31:44.795
I'm afraid that's not possible.

31:44.797 --> 31:46.964
Why? Something wrong with the ship?

31:46.966 --> 31:49.867
No, but your home no longer exists.

31:49.869 --> 31:51.568
Here is a map of what was formally known

31:51.570 --> 31:54.271
as the United States, circa 2017.

31:54.273 --> 31:56.211
I thought you said that
history has been restored.

31:56.213 --> 31:57.646
Does that look restored to you?

31:57.649 --> 31:59.943
What does "Magna Hesperia" mean?

31:59.945 --> 32:02.746
It means Caesar went on
to conquer the known world

32:02.748 --> 32:05.149
and then the unknown world.

32:05.151 --> 32:07.084
One of you fools must have entrusted him

32:07.086 --> 32:09.453
with future knowledge,
something that allowed him

32:09.455 --> 32:10.687
to alter the course of history.

32:10.689 --> 32:12.412
No, no. I mean, Sara hit him

32:12.415 --> 32:13.589
with Rip's flashy...

32:13.592 --> 32:15.459
- Flashy thing.
- Thing.

32:17.016 --> 32:18.716
Oh, my God.

32:18.719 --> 32:20.364
What?

32:22.768 --> 32:24.899
My book.

32:24.902 --> 32:26.268
What book?

32:29.542 --> 32:31.141
Change of plans.

32:31.143 --> 32:33.506
We're not marching on Rome, sir?

32:33.509 --> 32:35.576
No, we're still marching.

32:35.579 --> 32:37.380
But when we get there,
we're going to visit

32:37.383 --> 32:39.748
a few old friends...

32:39.751 --> 32:42.185
starting with Brutus

32:42.188 --> 32:43.487
and Cassius.

32:47.759 --> 32:49.384
I cannot believe you let Caesar

32:49.387 --> 32:51.322
steal the answers to the test.

32:51.325 --> 32:53.237
Why are you all looking
at me? It's not my fault.

32:53.239 --> 32:55.717
How did mop-head even
know there would be a test?

32:55.720 --> 32:56.935
It's a figure of speech.

32:56.937 --> 32:58.637
Caesar knew how to alter history

32:58.639 --> 33:00.706
because he already knew
how it would unfold.

33:00.708 --> 33:03.208
Okay, so all we got to
do is get back out there

33:03.210 --> 33:04.276
and refold history.

33:04.278 --> 33:05.577
Or contact Mr. Hunter,

33:05.579 --> 33:06.839
and let the Time Bureau handle it.

33:06.841 --> 33:07.946
No, no, no, no.

33:07.948 --> 33:09.451
We do not let those time-turds

33:09.454 --> 33:11.788
have the satisfaction
of knowing that we...

33:11.791 --> 33:13.285
That you lost the book?

33:13.287 --> 33:14.643
Stop blaming me, okay?

33:14.646 --> 33:16.588
Caesar must have swiped
it when I wasn't looking.

33:16.590 --> 33:18.190
- Nate's right.
- Thank you.

33:18.192 --> 33:19.725
Not about it not being your fault...

33:19.727 --> 33:21.193
About The Time Bureau.

33:21.195 --> 33:23.729
They're 2,000 years away.

33:23.731 --> 33:25.697
We can fix this before they even...

33:25.699 --> 33:27.566
Too late.

33:32.606 --> 33:34.813
Ms. Lance, a word.

33:34.816 --> 33:36.074
Yeah.

33:39.146 --> 33:40.979
Look, I know what you're gonna say,

33:40.981 --> 33:42.748
but we are gonna fix this.

33:42.750 --> 33:44.950
You shall do nothing of the sort.

33:44.952 --> 33:47.319
My agents will clear
this mess in no time.

33:47.321 --> 33:49.221
And what if something goes sideways?

33:49.223 --> 33:51.723
None of these guys are field agents.

33:51.725 --> 33:53.191
Admit it, Rip. You need us.

33:53.193 --> 33:55.594
No, Sara. You need this.

33:55.596 --> 33:58.530
But just because you all found
life outside this ship boring

33:58.532 --> 34:01.600
doesn't mean you get your old jobs back.

34:01.602 --> 34:03.168
Because the Time Bureau is capable

34:03.170 --> 34:05.203
of getting the job done...

34:05.205 --> 34:06.505
Without the mess.

34:08.475 --> 34:09.782
Status?

34:09.784 --> 34:12.310
We've got eyes on the
target. Go-team is hot.

34:12.312 --> 34:13.812
Yes, you are.

34:13.813 --> 34:16.547
Watch and learn, Ms. Lance.

34:16.550 --> 34:17.916
Execute.

34:35.869 --> 34:37.436
Asset acquired.

34:37.438 --> 34:38.804
Proceed to the target to commence

34:38.806 --> 34:40.272
memory erasure protocol.

34:40.274 --> 34:42.074
Wait, I've seen this play before.

34:42.076 --> 34:43.909
Leave the merchandise unattended,

34:43.911 --> 34:45.310
draw the target out...

34:45.312 --> 34:47.279
League of Assassins strategy?

34:47.281 --> 34:49.281
No, it's Sink Shower & Stuff.

34:49.283 --> 34:50.969
We use it to catch shoplift...

34:50.973 --> 34:52.072
It's a trap!

34:58.572 --> 35:00.382
You've got to pull
your team out of there.

35:00.385 --> 35:01.926
Agent Sharpe, initiate extraction.

35:01.929 --> 35:03.128
Extract.

35:11.538 --> 35:14.272
Uh, Agent Sharpe has been...

35:14.274 --> 35:15.379
apprehended.

35:15.382 --> 35:16.648
We were caught unprepared.

35:16.651 --> 35:18.284
But we'll go back in, and we...

35:18.287 --> 35:20.287
And screw things up worse
than you already have?

35:20.290 --> 35:21.880
Boss is right.

35:21.882 --> 35:24.549
We need to go and rescue Agent Hotcakes.

35:24.551 --> 35:26.485
Oh, please. This entire situation

35:26.487 --> 35:28.186
is happening because of you idiots...

35:28.188 --> 35:30.689
Idiots? Idiots with special abilities.

35:30.692 --> 35:32.190
We know how to handle ourselves.

35:32.192 --> 35:33.692
Not against Julius Caesar,

35:33.694 --> 35:35.827
who has an entire legion at his command.

35:35.829 --> 35:37.562
We're pretty good at
taking down legions.

35:37.564 --> 35:38.897
You're damn straight.

35:42.636 --> 35:44.569
I'm assuming the answer is no,

35:44.571 --> 35:46.771
but do any of you happen to have a plan?

35:50.410 --> 35:52.244
We're about to rejoin my army.

35:52.246 --> 35:53.545
Be grateful.

35:53.547 --> 35:55.614
Not only am I letting you live,

35:55.616 --> 35:59.117
I'm permitting you to witness
the rise of the Roman Empire.

35:59.119 --> 36:02.587
The Time Bureau will never
permit you to alter history.

36:02.589 --> 36:05.020
Caesar does not alter history.

36:05.023 --> 36:06.589
He makes it.

36:08.829 --> 36:11.596
Surrender your prisoner
in the name of Ares,

36:11.598 --> 36:13.231
the god of war!

36:13.233 --> 36:15.834
Mars is the Roman god of war, Jefferson.

36:15.836 --> 36:17.903
Yeah, whatever.

36:21.918 --> 36:24.442
- What the hell are you doing?
- Rescuing you.

36:24.444 --> 36:25.944
I can take care of myself.

36:35.689 --> 36:37.222
Howdy.

36:41.028 --> 36:43.495
Dormi strictum amicus.

36:45.067 --> 36:46.233
What did you say to him?

36:46.236 --> 36:48.002
Uh, "sleep tight, buddy"?

36:48.005 --> 36:49.405
I guess. Maybe.

36:49.408 --> 36:51.101
I think this deserves a bro hug.

36:51.104 --> 36:53.471
Bring it.

36:53.473 --> 36:55.073
Damn, Ray.

37:22.035 --> 37:24.278
You ruined my vacation...

37:24.281 --> 37:26.415
and my nose.

37:29.409 --> 37:31.161
Now we're even.

37:31.164 --> 37:34.346
See? Problem solved.

37:34.348 --> 37:36.146
I've got to say, Ms. Lance,

37:36.149 --> 37:38.683
now that I've seen your team
in action with my own eyes,

37:38.686 --> 37:41.286
you are even worse than I imagined.

37:42.551 --> 37:44.054
You're welcome.

37:57.369 --> 37:59.002
Well, like Nate said,

37:59.004 --> 38:01.972
sometimes we screw
things up for the better.

38:01.974 --> 38:04.875
I fail to see how
that's true in this case.

38:04.877 --> 38:06.576
It's our new motto.

38:06.578 --> 38:08.088
New motto?

38:08.091 --> 38:10.212
Right, does that mean that
you all plan to continue

38:10.215 --> 38:11.915
swashbuckling your way through history?

38:11.917 --> 38:14.785
With the Time Bureau's
permission, of course.

38:14.787 --> 38:17.020
And if I deny you permission?

38:17.022 --> 38:19.623
- We'll do it anyways.
- Yeah.

38:19.625 --> 38:21.858
Sir, the go-team has
erased the memories

38:21.860 --> 38:23.493
of Caesar and his forces.

38:23.495 --> 38:26.763
Good. We'd best take our leave, then.

38:26.765 --> 38:28.365
Sara. Mr. Rory.

38:28.367 --> 38:29.933
Do your best to stay out of trouble.

38:37.409 --> 38:38.742
What's that?

38:38.744 --> 38:41.411
It's a, uh, portal thingy.

38:42.285 --> 38:43.918
A, uh,

38:43.921 --> 38:47.751
communications thing,

38:47.753 --> 38:50.120
and a, uh... Ah, yes...

38:50.122 --> 38:51.621
a memory thing.

38:51.623 --> 38:53.123
So I guess that means you're staying.

38:53.125 --> 38:55.431
Well, I kind of have to.

38:55.434 --> 38:57.301
You'd be dead without me.

38:58.764 --> 38:59.896
Cheers.

39:05.103 --> 39:06.670
They are irresponsible,

39:06.672 --> 39:08.805
undependable, unpredictable, dangerous.

39:08.807 --> 39:11.241
And yet effective. At least on occasion.

39:11.243 --> 39:12.476
Is that the reason
they're not warming a cell

39:12.478 --> 39:14.077
back at headquarters as we speak?

39:14.079 --> 39:15.879
They're not warming
a cell, Agent Sharpe,

39:15.881 --> 39:17.180
because they might just be our best hope

39:17.182 --> 39:18.715
of defeating what's coming.

39:18.717 --> 39:21.758
They are the reason Mallus is a threat.

39:21.761 --> 39:23.073
Indeed.

39:23.076 --> 39:26.490
But there might just come a
day when we need the Legends

39:26.492 --> 39:28.058
to do what they do best...

39:28.060 --> 39:30.994
Which is what, exactly?

39:30.996 --> 39:32.863
Be the chainsaw.

39:35.425 --> 39:37.500
Would you open a portal
back to headquarters?

39:37.503 --> 39:38.802
I seem to have...

39:38.804 --> 39:40.937
misplaced my Time Courier.

39:48.213 --> 39:50.780
- How's she running?
- Lousy.

39:50.782 --> 39:53.149
Rip's monkeys really
screwed up the works.

39:53.151 --> 39:55.471
It's gonna take Ray
months to figure this out.

39:55.474 --> 39:56.685
Why Raymond?

39:56.688 --> 39:59.556
Well, I told Sara to take us back home.

39:59.558 --> 40:02.692
Oh, that's... that's
unfortunate, considering...

40:02.694 --> 40:04.194
I have decided to stay aboard.

40:04.196 --> 40:05.662
Whoa, wait, wait, what?

40:05.664 --> 40:08.298
I shanghaied you into our first voyage.

40:08.300 --> 40:10.133
I forced this life upon you.

40:10.135 --> 40:12.402
I could hardly ask
you to give it up now.

40:12.404 --> 40:13.737
But your life, your family...

40:13.739 --> 40:15.138
I'll make it home

40:15.140 --> 40:17.198
for the birth of my first grandchild.

40:17.201 --> 40:19.434
As for my family...

40:21.253 --> 40:23.547
They're on this ship as well.

40:27.953 --> 40:29.119
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

40:38.564 --> 40:40.063
You doing okay?

40:43.135 --> 40:45.936
Well, nothing says "doing okay" like

40:45.938 --> 40:48.672
pining over files of your ex.

40:48.674 --> 40:50.974
Yeah, I was just thinking...

40:51.910 --> 40:54.177
About her?

40:54.179 --> 40:57.681
Yeah, about her, and...

40:57.683 --> 40:59.716
and this place.

40:59.718 --> 41:01.651
I miss being on the ship.

41:02.777 --> 41:04.410
Yeah, of course you do.

41:04.413 --> 41:06.546
It's your home.

41:06.549 --> 41:09.793
And she's back home too.

41:09.795 --> 41:12.262
If she's happy, I'm happy.

41:12.264 --> 41:14.764
She's happy, right?

41:14.766 --> 41:17.534
Yeah. Totally.

41:17.536 --> 41:19.603
_

41:19.605 --> 41:21.905
This is the village.

41:24.743 --> 41:26.476
Get out of our way, woman.

41:26.478 --> 41:29.112
Actually, that's what
I was gonna tell you.

41:29.114 --> 41:31.414
We have business here.

41:31.416 --> 41:34.284
If you call poaching
and raping "business."

41:34.286 --> 41:37.387
Zambesi is under my protection.

41:51.494 --> 41:53.603
No! No, please don't!
