Rishi stays.
I found the headcount.

56:03.526 --> 56:07.363
Fuck, I'm stunned
at how relieved I am at that.

56:08.907 --> 56:11.076
Are you okay?

56:11.076 --> 56:13.078
-
<i>Doors opening.</i>
- Little light-headed.

56:13.078 --> 56:14.913
- Under the weather.

56:14.913 --> 56:17.123
- Been quite a few months.
- Hmm.

56:19.667 --> 56:21.795
<i>Doors closing.</i>

56:21.795 --> 56:24.255
It feels like a fever dream,
sometimes.

56:26.216 --> 56:27.467
Got to check you're real.

56:29.552 --> 56:32.764
- Yup, still alive.

56:35.767 --> 56:36.768
Uh-oh.

56:37.727 --> 56:39.521
- Time's up.

56:42.273 --> 56:44.651
God, I was a zombie
in that hotel room.

56:45.985 --> 56:47.529
I think I ran up quite the bill.

56:48.363 --> 56:49.948
You did.

56:49.948 --> 56:51.449
Pierpoint wouldn't cover it.

56:52.367 --> 56:53.409
I got it.

56:56.704 --> 56:57.705
Why?

56:59.165 --> 57:02.460
Why? We're past why.

57:07.674 --> 57:08.675
Thank you.

57:10.510 --> 57:13.012
- <i>Doors opening.</i>
- I'm doing this for you.

57:22.939 --> 57:24.440
EMPLOYEE 1:
Okay, what have we got today?

57:25.233 --> 57:26.442
What's the next 12 months?

57:26.526 --> 57:28.319
EMPLOYEE 2: We need to make
Pierpoint the market leader

57:28.403 --> 57:29.362
in ethical investing.

57:29.362 --> 57:30.488
EMPLOYEE 1: Good.

57:41.499 --> 57:42.584
What's going on?

57:45.920 --> 57:46.921
Please...

57:48.047 --> 57:49.424
this cannot be about Jesse.

57:51.426 --> 57:52.594
I didn't know
what he was gonna--

57:52.594 --> 57:55.555
Harp,
why don't you have a seat?

58:21.497 --> 58:22.916
There's no easy way
of saying this.

58:25.710 --> 58:26.961
It's been brought
to our attention

58:27.045 --> 58:30.715

your undergraduate degree.
