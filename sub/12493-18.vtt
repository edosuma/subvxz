00:05.750 --> 00:07.250
Congratulations, Mom.

00:07.375 --> 00:09.250
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.

00:09.375 --> 00:10.959
I was wondering
if you kids would remember.

00:11.041 --> 00:13.125
Well, who could forget a day like this?

00:13.792 --> 00:15.458
Any idea what we're talking about?

00:17.250 --> 00:18.834
It's our 20th wedding anniversary.

00:18.917 --> 00:21.250
Wow, 20 years with dad.

00:25.041 --> 00:28.041
Wow, that's a real
conversation stopper, isn't it?

00:29.291 --> 00:32.667
Okay, kids, your dad and I
have had 20 wonderful years.

00:32.750 --> 00:34.709
I gotta give the guy credit.
I mean, let's face it,

00:34.792 --> 00:37.667
sometimes I may not be the easiest person
in the world to live with.

00:38.959 --> 00:41.583
This is where you all jump in and say,
"No, no, no, Mom. You're great."

00:42.083 --> 00:43.500
All: No, no, no, Mom. You're great.

00:45.208 --> 00:47.125
So is dad gonna get you a nice gift?

00:47.208 --> 00:48.834
Kids, I love your father dearly,

00:48.917 --> 00:50.583
but when it comes to anniversary gifts,

00:50.667 --> 00:52.417
there's only one word to describe him.

00:52.500 --> 00:54.375
It starts with "ch" and ends in "eap."

00:55.875 --> 00:57.166
Yeah, I'm gonna need more hints.

01:00.834 --> 01:03.959
Yeah, the only gift he ever gets me
is a card he signs,

01:04.041 --> 01:06.542
"Happy anniversary. Love, me."

01:06.625 --> 01:08.458
Well, at least you get a card.

01:08.542 --> 01:11.250
It's the same card.
He reuses it every year.

01:12.291 --> 01:14.709
Well, who knows?
Maybe this year, he'll surprise you.

01:14.792 --> 01:17.291
Yeah, maybe he'll come into the kitchen
with his zipper up.

01:18.834 --> 01:21.583
- Good morning, everybody.
- Dad, barn door.

01:27.667 --> 01:29.041
For you, my dear.

01:29.458 --> 01:30.917
A card!

01:32.417 --> 01:33.834
Wonder what it says.

01:35.041 --> 01:37.375
"Happy anniversary. Love, me."

01:37.458 --> 01:39.625
- I love you too.
- Glad to hear it.

01:39.709 --> 01:42.208
In that case, read on.
There's more this year.

01:43.250 --> 01:46.125
"P. S. Aloha." What does that mean?

01:46.667 --> 01:49.458
That means that the Duncans...

01:50.208 --> 01:51.875
are going to Hawaii!

01:57.333 --> 01:59.458
I knew you'd come through.
You are so generous.

01:59.542 --> 02:02.125
Oh, thank you. I'm gonna need that back.

Huh? Only the best for you, my love.

03:17.041 --> 03:19.000
- Oh.
- Okay, I'm gonna check us in.

03:19.083 --> 03:20.000
Okay.

03:20.709 --> 03:21.542
Hey, Charlie.

03:21.625 --> 03:22.959
- You wanna go find the pool?
- Yeah.

03:23.041 --> 03:25.625
Let's make sure no one has
the same swimsuit as mommy.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.834
Okay, guys, come on,
you don't have to wait for me.

03:30.917 --> 03:33.041
Go outside, explore. We're in paradise.

03:33.125 --> 03:36.333
Dude, look at the size
of that flat-screen.

03:40.500 --> 03:41.959
Teddy, you don't have to hang with me.

03:42.041 --> 03:44.208
Come on, there's got to be something
for you to check out too.

03:44.250 --> 03:45.834
Uh, no, that's okay. I...

03:47.375 --> 03:48.375
found it.

03:50.917 --> 03:52.792
Hi, um, I'm Teddy.

03:53.125 --> 03:55.000
Aloha, Teddy. I'm Kai.

03:55.750 --> 03:58.250
Kai. What an interesting name.

03:58.333 --> 04:01.291
It means "the sea."
What does "Teddy" mean?

04:02.083 --> 04:04.959
Oh, it means my parents
were expecting a boy.

04:07.250 --> 04:09.583
So, are you into surfing?

04:10.458 --> 04:14.291
Am I? I have been complaining
about the lack of surf in Denver

04:14.375 --> 04:16.000
since... I don't know when.

04:17.166 --> 04:20.041
If you want a surfing lesson,
I'll be at the beach tomorrow morning.

04:20.834 --> 04:22.250
Yeah, I'd love that.

04:24.458 --> 04:27.583
Okay. Well, uh, aloha.

04:27.667 --> 04:31.250
That means "Hello, goodbye,
and I like your smile."

04:31.709 --> 04:33.375
Actually, just the first two.

04:33.458 --> 04:36.000
Yeah. No, I know.
I was going for an alo-ha-ha.

04:38.083 --> 04:39.083
I'm leaving now.

04:42.041 --> 04:44.709
Hi, I'd like to check in.
The name is Bob Duncan.

04:44.792 --> 04:47.542
I believe we have
the sizzlin' summer package.

04:47.625 --> 04:49.709
Yes, here it is. One room,

04:49.792 --> 04:52.667
and I see you will be attending
the timeshare presentation.

04:52.750 --> 04:54.000
- Hey.
- Hey!

04:54.083 --> 04:55.375
How much did you hear?

04:55.458 --> 04:58.458
Oh, not much, just something
about a timeshare. What is that?

04:58.750 --> 05:00.333
It, uh, it's-- you know what it is?

05:00.417 --> 05:01.458
It's complicated. Why don't--

05:01.542 --> 05:04.625
Timeshare is a hotel room
you buy one week every year

05:04.709 --> 05:06.500
- for the rest of your life.
- Okay, she doesn't...

05:06.583 --> 05:07.959
For attending our presentation,

05:08.041 --> 05:10.250
Mr. Duncan gets his entire trip for free.

05:10.375 --> 05:13.375
...need to know all that.

05:14.375 --> 05:15.417
Oh.

05:17.083 --> 05:18.333
So...

05:19.250 --> 05:22.000
Your big anniversary gift
to mom is a free trip?

05:22.083 --> 05:23.667
This is a win-win.

05:24.291 --> 05:26.250
Your mom thinks I'm a hero,
and I've got...

05:26.834 --> 05:29.083
I've got no intention
of buying a timeshare.

05:29.792 --> 05:30.959
Come on.

05:31.041 --> 05:32.959
Can't we keep this between us?

05:34.834 --> 05:36.208
Keep what between us?

05:38.000 --> 05:38.959
That's why you're my favorite.

05:39.041 --> 05:40.041
Teddy: Yeah, well.

05:44.625 --> 05:47.125
And here's our room!

05:47.208 --> 05:48.750
I love it!

05:48.834 --> 05:51.041
Oh, this is sweet. Where's our room?

05:51.125 --> 05:54.709
Uh, it's a computer glitch.
They messed up our reservation.

05:54.792 --> 05:56.375
Sounds believable to me.

05:57.625 --> 06:00.125
Wait, we're all staying in one room?

06:00.208 --> 06:02.959
Oh come on, you guys,
this is gonna be great. Look at this.

06:03.041 --> 06:05.750
We even have a view
of what, uh, appears to be

06:05.834 --> 06:07.417
the parking lot of a golf course!

06:08.959 --> 06:10.959
I don't want to share a room
with you people.

06:11.333 --> 06:12.834
Okay, you two stop it.

06:12.917 --> 06:16.166
Your very generous father
spent a lot of money to get us here.

06:16.208 --> 06:18.125
Sounds believable too.

06:20.125 --> 06:21.542
Where are we all gonna sleep?

06:21.625 --> 06:24.083
Oh, it's simple.
Girls in one bed, guys in the other.

06:24.166 --> 06:26.083
Oh, that is not fair. We have dad.

06:26.917 --> 06:29.625
Well, yeah, but Charlie
is a very restless sleeper.

06:29.709 --> 06:31.333
But we have dad.

06:31.417 --> 06:33.083
Would you relax?

06:33.625 --> 06:34.917
We're gonna make this work.

06:35.875 --> 06:38.000
Hey, Charlie, here we are in Hawaii.

06:38.083 --> 06:40.166
I'm in my bed, Mom's in my bed,

06:40.250 --> 06:41.709
you're in my bed.

06:42.709 --> 06:45.291
But we still have the good bed, because...

06:45.750 --> 06:47.959
- Dad, can you scoot over?
- Sorry.

06:48.500 --> 06:49.917
Ah!

06:51.125 --> 06:52.250
That's better.

06:54.500 --> 06:56.041
Wish them good luck, Charlie.

07:03.375 --> 07:06.667
That wasn't so bad.

07:07.709 --> 07:09.500
Speak for yourself.

07:18.333 --> 07:20.917
If Charlie Duncan sinks this putt,

07:21.000 --> 07:24.417
she wins a free trip
to the kahuna kiddies' club

07:24.500 --> 07:27.000
while mommy gets a full-body massage.

07:32.875 --> 07:35.000
And she wins the trip anyway!

07:36.083 --> 07:38.583
- I'm sorry, you can't go in there.
- Why not?

07:38.709 --> 07:41.000
- Because it is kapu.
- Kapu?

07:41.083 --> 07:44.333
It means "forbidden."
That is sacred ground.

07:44.417 --> 07:47.333
Sacred ground? Next to the towel hut?

07:47.417 --> 07:49.041
I don't think so.

07:49.125 --> 07:50.542
Stop!

07:50.625 --> 07:53.834
If you go in there,
bad things will happen.

07:54.583 --> 07:57.417
Listen, buddy, I have four kids
and I'm married to an exterminator.

07:57.500 --> 07:59.458
That's about as kapu as it gets.

08:06.375 --> 08:08.917
- What are you doing?
- Putting a curse on you.

08:09.333 --> 08:10.583
Oh, really?

08:10.834 --> 08:12.959
Well, if I were cursed, could I do this?

08:13.375 --> 08:17.875
♪ Ah-ua ah-ua, ah-uh ah ah ah ah ♪

08:17.959 --> 08:20.083
♪ Ding ding ding ding boo! ♪

08:24.375 --> 08:26.333
Now your whole family is cursed.

08:26.417 --> 08:29.041
Ooh, my whole family!

08:29.125 --> 08:31.959
Got any pets?
'Cause we could do this all day.

08:33.083 --> 08:35.041
I'll tell you what. You do this all day,

08:35.125 --> 08:36.917
and I'm gonna enjoy my vacation.

08:37.709 --> 08:39.750
Ah, there it is!

08:39.834 --> 08:41.166
Huh. Cursed.

08:41.625 --> 08:42.875
Plea-- oh!

08:45.917 --> 08:48.417
I used the fast-acting curse.

08:59.208 --> 09:01.375
Guys, come on. We're in Hawaii.

09:01.458 --> 09:03.750
You can't sit in a room all day
playing video games.

09:03.834 --> 09:05.917
Yeah, we could, if you'd leave us alone.

09:06.166 --> 09:07.709
What could you possibly be playing

09:07.792 --> 09:09.542
that could be better
than exploring Hawaii?

09:09.625 --> 09:12.792
It's a really cool game
called "Tropical Chopper Challenge."

09:12.875 --> 09:15.667
Yeah, right now, we're flying
helicopters over volcanoes.

09:15.750 --> 09:17.375
You can do that for real on the island.

09:17.458 --> 09:19.041
Well, yeah, but are the graphics
this good?

09:20.000 --> 09:21.417
- Let's see.
- Check it out.

09:21.500 --> 09:24.583
Oh! Oh, yeah!

09:24.667 --> 09:26.208
Come on, guys, let's go!

09:26.291 --> 09:28.125
Come on, I'm gonna drop you off
at the helicopter.

09:28.208 --> 09:29.667
You're gonna have the time of your lives.

09:29.750 --> 09:31.750
Look at this. I even got a coupon.

09:33.542 --> 09:35.333
"Hal's discount helicopter.

09:35.417 --> 09:38.291
Serving the island since February."

09:38.875 --> 09:39.750
Let's go.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.417
Hey, Gabe, in the car, do you want
to play "Snorkeling Adventure"?

09:44.000 --> 09:46.667
Unless they have that in Hawaii too.

09:56.625 --> 09:57.625
Hi, Kai.

09:57.709 --> 09:59.166
Oh, that rhymed.

10:01.458 --> 10:03.542
So, uh, am I the only one here?

10:03.625 --> 10:05.458
Is this gonna be a private lesson?

10:06.083 --> 10:08.792
Unless someone else shows up.
Let me get you a board.

10:08.875 --> 10:11.291
All right. Later, gator!

10:12.375 --> 10:13.458
Too much.

10:14.959 --> 10:17.083
Is this where the surfing lessons are?

10:18.333 --> 10:21.458
Uh, yeah. You're interested in surfing?

10:21.917 --> 10:23.875
Well, at home, I love channel surfing,

10:23.959 --> 10:25.291
so I thought I'd try the other kind.

10:28.709 --> 10:32.250
Well, uh, you... you might have
a hard time with this class.

10:32.583 --> 10:35.000
The teacher doesn't speak
any English whatsoever.

10:35.417 --> 10:37.000
I'll be right with you, Teddy!

10:38.208 --> 10:39.875
Wow, he's gotten better.

10:42.458 --> 10:44.041
Woman: Is that the surfing instructor?

10:44.125 --> 10:46.417
- Uh-huh.
- And you want to be alone with him?

10:46.500 --> 10:48.375
- Uh-huh.
- Why didn't you just say so?

10:48.458 --> 10:50.250
Hawaii is for romance.

10:50.792 --> 10:53.458
I'll find somewhere else
to avoid my husband.

10:54.250 --> 10:55.291
Thank you.

10:56.834 --> 10:58.291
- Bye.
- Bye.

10:59.375 --> 11:01.208
- Who was that?
- I don't know.

11:01.291 --> 11:02.792
She didn't speak any English.

11:11.375 --> 11:14.041
Oh, Mr. Duncan? Just want to remind you

11:14.125 --> 11:16.792
the timeshare presentation
is today at 3:00.

11:16.875 --> 11:19.583
Yes. Yes. By the way, how long
is the presentation?

11:19.667 --> 11:21.083
Six and a half hours.

11:21.792 --> 11:23.375
Wo-- wow.

11:23.458 --> 11:25.083
Why-- why so long?

11:25.166 --> 11:27.000
It takes a while to break people down.

11:27.834 --> 11:29.542
I mean, we have a lot of ground to cover.

11:31.417 --> 11:33.041
Okay. See you then...

11:34.750 --> 11:36.041
Or not.

11:37.041 --> 11:38.208
- Hey, honey.
- Hey.

11:38.291 --> 11:41.166
- Who was that?
- Uh, him?

11:41.250 --> 11:44.583
Uh... director of ping-pong services.

11:46.458 --> 11:47.834
Do you want to meet me by the pool?

11:47.917 --> 11:49.166
Yeah, yeah, let me grab my suit.

11:49.250 --> 11:50.959
And then I'll tell you about my curse.

11:51.667 --> 11:52.542
Your what?

11:53.291 --> 11:54.917
Cute story. You're gonna laugh.

11:55.000 --> 11:55.917
All right.

11:59.834 --> 12:02.000
Oh, I am so glad you're here.

12:02.083 --> 12:03.083
Thank you.

12:03.583 --> 12:04.458
Do I know you?

12:05.125 --> 12:07.000
I happen to have a deathly fear
of elevators.

12:07.083 --> 12:08.834
I hate riding in them alone.

12:08.917 --> 12:11.166
Well, now you have an elevator buddy.

12:25.583 --> 12:27.834
- You okay?
- Fine so far.

12:28.583 --> 12:30.542
But believe me,
if this thing ever broke down,

12:30.583 --> 12:32.375
you would not want to be in here with me.

12:33.875 --> 12:35.250
Don't worry, nothing's going to happen.

12:37.917 --> 12:40.458
- What's going on?
- We stopped.

12:41.709 --> 12:43.417
You lied to me!

12:43.792 --> 12:45.375
Wha-- uh, uh...

12:45.458 --> 12:48.083
No, no, no, calm down.
I'm sure we'll start up again in a second.

12:48.166 --> 12:50.041
- Ah, hold me!
- Oh!

12:52.291 --> 12:56.792
Um, okay, why don't we use
the emergency phone to call someone?

12:56.875 --> 12:59.417
Okay? Okay, we'll go together.

12:59.500 --> 13:00.917
Ready? Go.

13:04.125 --> 13:06.542
Okay, look, just relax.
We're going to be fine

13:06.625 --> 13:08.000
as long as we don't lose power.

13:18.792 --> 13:20.542
First time in a helicopter, boys?

13:20.625 --> 13:22.333
- Yep.
- Mine too.

13:23.917 --> 13:26.917
Ha! A little helicopter humor.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.166
Hey, what's that over there?

13:29.250 --> 13:31.500
No idea. Just moved here.

13:32.375 --> 13:35.500
Flew tours over the Grand Canyon
for 30 years.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.583
Hey, what's the name of that volcano?

13:38.166 --> 13:39.333
Beats me.

13:39.417 --> 13:43.083
But did you know that the Grand Canyon's
also a mile deep?

13:44.000 --> 13:45.834
Yeah, I didn't, but school's out,

13:45.917 --> 13:48.166
so I'm not supposed
to be learning anything new.

13:51.291 --> 13:53.417
Do you know anything about Hawaii?

13:53.458 --> 13:55.291
I know they got some weird food.

13:55.375 --> 13:57.709
I had some crazy fish today.

13:58.917 --> 14:00.792
It's not sitting too well.

14:03.667 --> 14:06.542
Either of you guys know how
to fly one of these things?

14:07.667 --> 14:09.667
Oh, is that more helicopter humor?

14:10.750 --> 14:14.250
'Fraid not. I feel like I'm gonna--

14:27.917 --> 14:30.417
- Oh, PJ, do something.
- I am!

14:34.417 --> 14:36.500
Wake up, old dude! Wake up!

14:37.083 --> 14:39.166
PJ, what are we going to do?

14:40.917 --> 14:42.875
Words, PJ! Words!

14:44.917 --> 14:45.834
Oh.

14:46.458 --> 14:48.208
Well, maybe I could fly this thing.

14:48.250 --> 14:50.625
Gabe: These controls kind of look like
my video game.

14:51.250 --> 14:53.166
Where the heck is the zombie cannon?

14:57.125 --> 15:00.250
Oh, please, God,
if you let me live through this,

15:00.333 --> 15:02.125
I promise I'll do something good.

15:04.333 --> 15:07.125
Another way to see the Grand Canyon
is by burro.

15:13.250 --> 15:14.750
Wow!

15:14.834 --> 15:16.375
You work fast.

15:24.542 --> 15:26.875
All right, good, steady.

15:27.750 --> 15:30.125
Think you got it now? Can I let go?

15:30.208 --> 15:32.834
No, no. No, not quite yet.

15:35.041 --> 15:36.458
Okay.

15:36.542 --> 15:38.583
So I think we've done enough balance.

15:38.667 --> 15:39.792
How about some board control?

15:39.917 --> 15:42.709
Oh, surfing, surfing, surfing.

15:45.083 --> 15:47.041
That is why we're here, right?

15:47.959 --> 15:49.709
Well, yeah, but...

15:49.792 --> 15:51.917
I thought maybe we could get
to know each other.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.917
Um, okay, I'll go first.

15:54.792 --> 15:56.166
I love smoothies,

15:56.250 --> 15:59.917
um, you know, especially after a workout,

16:00.041 --> 16:02.709
or, or like a lesson of some kind.

16:03.750 --> 16:06.458
Well, after the lesson's done,

16:06.959 --> 16:08.250
do you want to get a smoothie?

16:08.375 --> 16:10.750
Look at you. Always one step ahead of me.

16:12.583 --> 16:14.959
Okay, you think you're ready
to hit the water?

16:15.834 --> 16:16.875
I guess.

16:17.667 --> 16:19.542
Don't worry, you'll be a natural.

16:19.625 --> 16:20.959
Okay.

16:29.208 --> 16:32.583
Whoo-hoo! This is awesome!

16:32.667 --> 16:34.041
Whoa, yeah!

16:34.750 --> 16:36.542
I told you you'd be a natural.

16:36.625 --> 16:38.542
Oh, look, one foot.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.458
Oh, look, no feet.

16:45.166 --> 16:46.583
Gnarly!

16:46.667 --> 16:49.542
Cowabunga!

16:49.625 --> 16:51.125
Hey, what are you doing here?

16:51.208 --> 16:52.875
This is my private lesson.

16:52.959 --> 16:54.709
You know you're dreaming, right?

16:55.500 --> 16:56.458
What?

16:56.542 --> 16:57.875
Wake up, Teddy!

17:00.667 --> 17:02.875
Teddy, wake up.

17:02.959 --> 17:05.208
Honey, you okay?

17:06.375 --> 17:07.667
What happened?

17:07.750 --> 17:10.166
The last thing I remember
I was at my surfing lesson.

17:10.250 --> 17:13.709
Yeah. Well, uh, that didn't go too well.

17:14.166 --> 17:16.875
On your first wave,
you shouted, "I'm a natural!"

17:16.959 --> 17:19.000
And then you landed on your head.

17:19.083 --> 17:20.834
Oh, no.

17:20.917 --> 17:23.083
I missed my smoothie date.

17:23.166 --> 17:25.041
He was so cute.

17:29.542 --> 17:30.959
What happened to you?

17:31.041 --> 17:34.000
I was almost smothered
by my elevator buddy.

17:34.834 --> 17:36.000
Oh, yeah, big whoop.

17:36.083 --> 17:38.458
We were almost killed
in a helicopter crash.

17:38.542 --> 17:41.333
Didn't you hear me?
I missed my smoothie date.

17:45.166 --> 17:47.750
Wow, bad day for the Duncans.

17:47.834 --> 17:50.291
It's almost like
the whole family's cursed.

17:51.583 --> 17:52.875
What are you all looking at me for?

17:52.959 --> 17:55.875
Huh? I-- I don't know
anything about a curse.

17:58.375 --> 18:00.375
Well, didn't you mention something
about a curse earlier?

18:00.458 --> 18:02.291
No, no, no. No, no.

18:02.375 --> 18:04.417
I think I might have mentioned
something about a purse.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.291
Why would I mention
something about a curse?

18:07.166 --> 18:09.458
I mean, nothing's happened
to Charlie or you.

18:09.542 --> 18:11.208
That's true. I'm good.

18:11.250 --> 18:12.834
Man: Fore!

18:29.166 --> 18:30.625
Mr. Duncan?

18:33.500 --> 18:34.458
Hi.

18:35.125 --> 18:38.333
Um, I was just doing a, uh...
just doing a quick plant inspection.

18:38.417 --> 18:40.917
Yeah, that's a-- that's a ficus.

18:41.792 --> 18:44.458
We missed you yesterday
at the timeshare presentation.

18:44.542 --> 18:46.125
If you don't attend the one today,

18:46.166 --> 18:48.625
we'll be forced to charge you
for your entire trip.

18:48.959 --> 18:52.125
- Everything?
- Down to the last macadamia nut.

19:02.417 --> 19:03.417
Timeshare?

19:14.083 --> 19:15.291
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:16.709 --> 19:18.542
You're watching TV, but it's not on.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.125
I don't deserve entertainment.

19:21.750 --> 19:23.792
Dude, what's the matter with you?

19:23.875 --> 19:26.417
I can't get what happened
in the helicopter out of my head.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.250
I just feel like a coward.

19:30.041 --> 19:33.125
Well, normally, I'd say
that's because you are a coward,

19:33.208 --> 19:36.208
but I made this promise to be good,
so I won't say that.

19:37.834 --> 19:39.875
When the helicopter pilot
passed out, I just...

19:40.625 --> 19:41.959
I froze.

19:42.709 --> 19:44.000
I didn't do anything.

19:44.083 --> 19:46.250
Except scream like a little girl...

19:46.333 --> 19:48.083
Is something else I won't say.

19:50.458 --> 19:52.709
You know, it almost feels like
you are saying those things.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.083
Well, being good is new to me,
so there's gonna be some snags.

19:58.875 --> 20:01.709
I just feel like a total loser.

20:03.500 --> 20:04.792
Well, wait a minute.

20:05.667 --> 20:07.875
I made a promise to god
to do something good.

20:08.458 --> 20:11.250
And if I help you face your fears,
that would count, right?

20:11.625 --> 20:13.375
And then God and I would be square.

20:13.917 --> 20:17.000
- You'd do that for me?
- That's what good people do, right?

20:17.542 --> 20:20.083
I mean, I'm just guessing here.

20:27.083 --> 20:28.667
Hey, elevator buddy.

20:30.208 --> 20:32.041
Oh, dear, what happened to you?

20:32.834 --> 20:36.625
Swimming. Jellyfish.
Things keep happening.

20:44.834 --> 20:47.083
Come on, Charlie,
let's go see the pretty garden.

20:48.166 --> 20:50.583
Or let's go see the pretty boy.

20:51.041 --> 20:52.917
The garden's not going anywhere.

20:54.583 --> 20:56.375
- Teddy: Kai.
- Teddy.

20:56.667 --> 20:57.625
How are you feeling?

20:57.709 --> 20:59.208
That was quite the fall
you took yesterday.

20:59.250 --> 21:01.208
Oh, yeah, but I'm fine now.

21:01.250 --> 21:04.083
So, um, can we reschedule that smoothie?

21:04.166 --> 21:05.709
Kai: Hold on, let me check.

21:09.083 --> 21:11.792
How about after my next surf lesson?
Wanna meet then?

21:11.875 --> 21:14.125
Sure, I'd love that.

21:19.959 --> 21:22.542
- Then it's a date.
- Second time's the charm.

21:24.250 --> 21:26.542
Well, that went well, didn't it, Charlie?

21:28.959 --> 21:30.125
Charlie?

21:30.959 --> 21:32.083
Charlie!

21:37.709 --> 21:39.709
Announcer:
Next time on Good Luck Charlie...

21:39.792 --> 21:42.166
Charlie? Here, girl!

21:43.583 --> 21:45.458
People, quiet!

21:45.542 --> 21:47.792
I know this is gonna sound
really crazy, but here goes.

21:48.834 --> 21:50.375
We've been cursed.

21:50.458 --> 21:52.542
You put this curse on my family,

21:52.625 --> 21:54.625
and I was just wondering
if you could reverse it?

21:54.709 --> 21:57.000
- Ready for our date?
- Ah!

21:57.500 --> 22:00.333
Quick favor.
I need you to pretend to be mom.

22:00.417 --> 22:02.166
Why don't you stand up
and introduce yourselves?

22:02.250 --> 22:04.291
- Bob.
- Ted-- Amy.

22:04.375 --> 22:05.667
Ted Amy.

22:06.250 --> 22:08.125
PJ, I need your list of fears.

22:08.208 --> 22:10.709
I made a promise
that I would do something good.
