WEBVTT

00:02.602 --> 00:05.038
DO YOU HEAR THAT KNOCKING
THAT'S HAPPENING?

00:07.273 --> 00:10.908
THIS IS WHERE THE PREVIOUS
OWNER COMMITTED SUICIDE.

00:10.943 --> 00:13.946
THERE'S A ROOM IN THE BASEMENT,
AND WE CALL IT THE SCARY ROOM.

00:13.981 --> 00:16.914
IF I WANTED TO HIDE SOMEBODY,
THIS WOULD BE A GOOD SPOT.

00:16.949 --> 00:19.552
SHE'S ACTUALLY LEAVING HER HOUSE
BECAUSE SHE'S SO FREAKED OUT.

00:19.587 --> 00:21.354
GET OUR ATTENTION
SOME OTHER WAY.

00:21.389 --> 00:23.087
- COME ON. WHERE ARE YOU?
- GOD!

00:23.122 --> 00:26.526
SHE HAS HAD THINGS MOVE.
SHE'S HEARD VOICES.

00:31.897 --> 00:33.699
I'M AMY BRUNI.

00:33.700 --> 00:36.100
AND I'M ADAM BERRY.

00:36.135 --> 00:38.202
WE'VE SPENT
A COMBINED 30 YEARS

00:38.203 --> 00:41.807
INVESTIGATING THE WORLD'S
MOST TERRIFYING HAUNTINGS.

00:41.842 --> 00:43.741
AFTER THOUSANDS OF CASES,

00:43.776 --> 00:47.046
WE ARE READY FOR OUR
MOST IMPORTANT JOURNEY YET.

00:49.148 --> 00:51.649
RESCUING FAMILIES
TERRORIZED

00:51.684 --> 00:55.304
BY PARANORMAL ACTIVITY
IN THEIR OWN HOMES.

00:55.339 --> 00:58.549
WE UNCOVER THE TRUTH
BEHIND THE HAUNTING

00:58.584 --> 01:01.760
TO HELP FAMILIES
RECLAIM THEIR HOMES...

01:01.761 --> 01:03.965
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- ...AND THEIR LIVES.

01:08.601 --> 01:10.168
- I HAVE A CASE.
- YEP.

01:10.203 --> 01:12.688
THIS IS A LOCAL WOMAN.
HER NAME IS MEGHAN.

01:12.723 --> 01:15.174
SHE BOUGHT A HOUSE
ABOUT 10 MONTHS AGO.

01:15.209 --> 01:17.442
AND EVER SINCE
SHE MOVED IN,

01:17.477 --> 01:18.977
CRAZY THINGS HAVE
STARTED HAPPENING.

01:19.012 --> 01:20.845
SHE'S GOTTEN TO THE POINT
WHERE SHE'S ACTUALLY

01:20.880 --> 01:23.465
LEAVING HER HOUSE SOMETIMES
BECAUSE SHE'S SO FREAKED OUT.

01:23.500 --> 01:27.045
SHE THINKS SOMEBODY'S TRYING
TO BREAK IN TO HER HOUSE.

01:27.080 --> 01:30.555
SO SHE WENT AS FAR AS
INSTALLING SECURITY CAMERAS.

01:30.590 --> 01:34.694
BUT SHE CAUGHT WHAT SHE THINKS
IS EVIDENCE OF THE PARANORMAL.

01:34.729 --> 01:37.964
SHE'S HAD THINGS MOVE.
SHE'S HAD THINGS THROWN.

01:37.999 --> 01:40.733
SHE HAS HEARD VOICES
IN THE HOUSE.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.599
OKAY. WOW.

01:42.634 --> 01:45.054
THIS IS HER
SECURITY FOOTAGE.

01:45.089 --> 01:47.474
I WANT YOU TO LISTEN
TO THIS ONE.

01:52.712 --> 01:54.212
WHAT?

01:54.247 --> 01:56.014
SHE'S ASLEEP.
IS SHE IN THE HOUSE?

01:56.049 --> 01:57.950
SHE WAS, UPSTAIRS
WHEN THIS HAPPENED.

01:57.985 --> 01:59.852
YEAH. LET ME LISTEN TO IT
ONE MORE TIME

01:59.887 --> 02:01.518
JUST BECAUSE
I WANNA MAKE SURE.

02:01.553 --> 02:03.889
IT SOUNDS VERY MECHANICAL,
WHICH WE'VE HEARD IT BEFORE.

02:03.924 --> 02:05.824
I MEAN, WE'VE HEARD THINGS
LIKE THAT BEFORE.

02:05.825 --> 02:08.192
YEAH. WE'VE HEARD EVP
WHERE IT SOUNDS

02:08.227 --> 02:10.597
LIKE IT'S COMING FROM, LIKE,
A RADIO OR SOMETHING.

02:10.632 --> 02:13.964
RIGHT.

02:13.999 --> 02:16.267
- SOMETHING ABOUT "HEAR ME."
- YEAH.

02:16.302 --> 02:19.672
THERE'S LIKE
1,000 DIFFERENT THINGS GOING ON.

02:22.608 --> 02:25.844
IN THIS CASE, THERE ARE JUST
SO MANY DIFFERENT OPTIONS

02:25.879 --> 02:29.749
AS TO WHAT COULD BE
GOING ON INSIDE THIS HOME.

02:29.784 --> 02:31.734
THIS IS DEFINITELY
AN OLD HOUSE.

02:31.769 --> 02:33.685
- IT'S DEFINITELY OLD.
- YEAH.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.253
THE ONE COMMONALITY IS

02:35.288 --> 02:37.223
THAT WE HAVE A SCARED
AND FRIGHTENED HOMEOWNER.

02:37.258 --> 02:39.159
SO WE NEED TO WALK THROUGH
THE HOUSE WITH MEGHAN

02:39.194 --> 02:41.025
AND SET UP A PLAN
BASED ON THE SPOTS

02:41.026 --> 02:43.061
THAT SHE'S EXPERIENCED
THE MOST ACTIVITY.

02:43.096 --> 02:45.097
THEN WE'LL TRY TO DETERMINE
IF THE ACTIVITY

02:45.098 --> 02:46.364
IN DIFFERENT PARTS
OF THE HOUSE

02:46.399 --> 02:49.202
ARE CONNECTED
OR HAVE ANY SIMILARITIES.

02:52.838 --> 02:53.906
- HI.
- HI.

02:53.907 --> 02:56.092
- AMY.
- NICE TO MEET YOU. I'M MEGHAN.

02:56.127 --> 02:58.019
HI, MEGHAN.
ADAM. NICE TO MEET YOU.

02:58.054 --> 02:59.911
NICE MEETING YOU. WELCOME.
COME ON IN.

02:59.912 --> 03:02.014
SO WE KNOW A LITTLE
ABOUT THE CASE.

03:02.049 --> 03:04.283
BUT WHAT WE WANNA KNOW
FROM YOU IS EVERYTHING.

03:04.318 --> 03:06.518
SO YOU START THE TOUR.
YOU TAKE US TO THE SPOTS.

03:06.553 --> 03:08.521
YOU LET US KNOW
WHAT YOUR PROBLEMS ARE.

03:08.556 --> 03:09.888
- OKAY?
- SURE.

03:09.889 --> 03:11.791
YOU'VE BEEN IN THE HOUSE
YOU'VE SAID, 10 MONTHS, RIGHT?

03:11.826 --> 03:13.858
NOW, HOW SOON
AFTER YOU MOVED IN

03:13.893 --> 03:17.596
DID YOU START EXPERIENCING
WHAT YOU THOUGHT WAS ACTIVITY?

03:17.631 --> 03:19.699
PRETTY MUCH
THE FIRST NIGHT.

03:21.867 --> 03:24.102
THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME
THAT MY SISTER, DANA,

03:24.137 --> 03:25.503
HAD BEEN IN THE HOUSE.

03:25.538 --> 03:27.572
SHE STARTED TO GO
INTO THE BASEMENT.

03:27.607 --> 03:29.809
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
SHE JUST CAME RUNNING OUT

03:29.844 --> 03:31.675
OF THE HOUSE, SCREAMING.

03:31.710 --> 03:33.711
SHE WAS COMING
DOWN THE STAIRS

03:33.746 --> 03:38.250
AND SAW A DARK SHADOW
RUNNING ACROSS THE BOTTOM

03:38.285 --> 03:39.416
OF THE STAIRS

03:39.451 --> 03:42.054
FROM THIS SIDE OVER
TO THAT SIDE OVER THERE.

03:42.089 --> 03:43.420
WHAT IS THIS?

03:43.455 --> 03:46.841
IT'S A CRAWLSPACE IN THERE. YOU
CAN FEEL FREE TO GO IN YOURSELF.

03:46.876 --> 03:50.228
I'M NOT GOING TO -- WELL, YOU
KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT SPIDERS.

03:50.229 --> 03:53.432
I'M GONNA OPEN THE DOOR.

03:53.467 --> 03:54.465
GOD.

03:54.500 --> 03:55.868
HERE. THERE YOU GO.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.236
- GOD.
- YEAH. JUST PULL IT.

03:57.271 --> 03:59.037
GOD.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.374
IT'S KINDA CREEPY
IN THERE.

04:02.842 --> 04:05.511
GOD! GOD.

04:08.214 --> 04:11.651
THERE'S FOUNDATION
IN HERE, REALLY OLD.

04:13.653 --> 04:17.019
- I MEAN, WHAT'S THIS HIDING?
- I DON'T KNOW.

04:17.055 --> 04:20.958
BUT WE'LL JUST KEEP THAT
IN MIND AS WE INVESTIGATE.

04:20.993 --> 04:24.263
ANYTHING IN THIS BASEMENT THAT'S
BELONGED TO THE PREVIOUS OWNERS?

04:24.298 --> 04:25.663
ACTUALLY, A LOTTA STUFF.

04:25.698 --> 04:30.036
MOST OF THIS STUFF OVER HERE
WAS FROM THE PREVIOUS OWNERS.

04:30.071 --> 04:33.806
THERE'S SOME WEDDING PHOTOS,
SOME BABY PHOTOS.

04:33.841 --> 04:35.407
AND THE CHRISTMAS STUFF?

04:35.408 --> 04:36.676
AND THE CHRISTMAS STUFF
RIGHT THERE IS ALL THEIRS.

04:36.711 --> 04:38.042
- REALLY? ALL THEIRS?
- YEP.

04:38.077 --> 04:40.246
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU
HAD CONTACT WITH THE OTHER --

04:40.281 --> 04:43.849
WITH THE FAMILY?
- PROBABLY AROUND THANKSGIVING.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.449
- OKAY.
- 'CAUSE I WAS FIGURING

04:45.484 --> 04:47.587
THAT THEY MIGHT WANT
THE CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS.

04:47.622 --> 04:48.753
RIGHT. FOR SURE.

04:48.788 --> 04:51.924
WHY HAVEN'T YOU GIVEN THEM,
LIKE -- I MEAN,

04:51.959 --> 04:55.061
SO, FOR INSTANCE,
YOU GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY

04:55.096 --> 04:56.461
TO COME
AND COLLECT THE THINGS.

04:56.496 --> 04:58.296
THEY DON'T COME.
YOU CONTACT THEM AGAIN.

04:58.297 --> 04:59.415
MAYBE THEY DON'T COME.

04:59.450 --> 05:00.498
WHAT MAKES YOU KEEP THEM?

05:00.533 --> 05:02.235
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST GET RID OF THEM?

05:02.270 --> 05:03.334
WHY AREN'T -- THIS, LIKE...

05:03.369 --> 05:06.139
I DON'T REALLY KNOW.
I JUST DON'T FEEL RIGHT...

05:06.174 --> 05:08.207
- THAT'S GOOD.
- ...THROWING THEM OUT.

05:08.242 --> 05:10.241
- OKAY.
- I MEAN, IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING

05:10.242 --> 05:11.877
THAT THEY JUST NEED TO
GET TO THAT POINT

05:11.912 --> 05:13.062
WHERE THEY CAN
COME GET IT.

05:13.097 --> 05:14.212
- YEAH.
- COME AND TAKE IT.

05:14.213 --> 05:16.613
THAT'S MY FEELING, TOO, IS,
I DON'T WANNA BE

05:16.648 --> 05:19.352
DISRESPECTFUL IN ANY WAY
BY JUST THROWING 'EM OUT

05:23.655 --> 05:25.357
SO I RECOGNIZE THIS ROOM.

05:25.358 --> 05:27.810
- AND I SEE THE CAMERA.
- THERE'S MY CAMERA.

05:27.845 --> 05:30.227
THAT CAMERA TURNED OFF
ONE NIGHT ON ITS OWN.

05:30.262 --> 05:33.899
THE ONLY WAY TO TURN IT OFF
IS TO JUST PHYSICALLY UNPLUG IT.

05:33.934 --> 05:36.269
WHEN I WENT
TO LOOK AT THE TAPE,

05:36.304 --> 05:38.569
THERE WAS A VOICE
ON THE CAMERA.

05:38.604 --> 05:41.341
IT YELLED OUT, "HELLO.
CAN ANYONE HEAR ME?"

05:45.377 --> 05:47.144
TERRIFYING.
TERRIFYING.

05:47.179 --> 05:50.181
REALLY KINDA FREAKY.
LITTLE CREEPY.

05:50.182 --> 05:52.185
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

05:56.422 --> 06:00.391
SO, UP HERE, ORIGINALLY,
I HAD A BED IN THERE.

06:00.426 --> 06:04.596
AND PROBABLY WITHIN A FEW DAYS
OR SO AFTER MOVING IN,

06:04.631 --> 06:08.767
I WOKE UP IN THE MORNING
TO KNOCKING ON THE DOOR.

06:08.802 --> 06:11.871
- ON THIS DOOR?
- ON THAT DOOR.

06:11.906 --> 06:14.905
NOBODY WAS HERE.
IT WAS JUST ME.

06:14.940 --> 06:17.693
OF COURSE YOU MOVED.
YOU GOT YOUR BED.

06:17.728 --> 06:20.446
- YOU SWITCHED ROOMS.
- YOU SWITCHED ROOMS.

06:20.481 --> 06:24.516
THIS IS WHERE, UM,
THE PREVIOUS OWNER,

06:24.551 --> 06:28.521
UM, COMMITTED SUICIDE.

06:30.422 --> 06:34.360
SO THAT'S THE ONLY THING
THAT'S HAPPENED IN THIS ROOM?

06:34.395 --> 06:37.728
UM, AND ALSO WITH MY DOG,
SADIE, SHE --

06:37.763 --> 06:40.364
ONE NIGHT, SHE WAS JUST
GROWLING AT THIS CORNER.

06:40.365 --> 06:43.936
SO YOUR DOGS, LIKE, HAVE
SEEMED TO REACT TO THINGS?

06:43.971 --> 06:45.269
YES.

06:45.304 --> 06:48.106
THIS IS WHERE
MY NEPHEWS SLEEP.

06:48.141 --> 06:49.473
AHA.

06:49.508 --> 06:50.908
IN HERE, THERE WAS --

06:50.943 --> 06:54.380
ONE NIGHT THAT I WAS
SLEEPING IN MY ROOM,

06:54.415 --> 06:57.817
AND I HEARD A LOUD BANG
AGAINST ONE OF THE DOORS.

06:57.852 --> 07:00.353
OKAY. YEAH.
THAT'S SUBSTANTIAL.

07:00.388 --> 07:01.885
AND I HAD TO OPEN
THE DOOR.

07:01.920 --> 07:04.388
THERE WAS A TOY
BEHIND THE DOOR.

07:04.423 --> 07:08.594
SO IT SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS THROWN
AGAINST THE BACK OF THE DOOR.

07:08.629 --> 07:12.362
- WERE THERE WINDOWS OPEN?
- NO.

07:12.397 --> 07:15.334
SO WE -- WE'VE SEEN
THE ENTIRE HOUSE, RIGHT?

07:15.369 --> 07:17.737
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS
TO LOOK AT.

07:17.772 --> 07:20.106
- WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO.
- YEP.

07:23.976 --> 07:27.814
HONEY, I'M HOME!
JUST KIDDING.

07:27.849 --> 07:30.681
- THE CAMERAS FIRST, RIGHT?
- CAMERAS FIRST.

07:30.716 --> 07:33.119
WE ARE SETTING UP
OUR OWN SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM

07:33.154 --> 07:35.454
IN EVERY SPACE
THAT MEGHAN HAS EXPERIENCED

07:35.489 --> 07:37.190
SOME KIND OF ACTIVITY.

07:42.994 --> 07:45.495
- BRUNI.
- YES.

07:45.530 --> 07:47.566
WE ARE ALL SET
IN THE BASEMENT.

07:47.601 --> 07:48.699
OKAY.

07:48.734 --> 07:50.902
SO WE'VE GOT
THE DVR CAMERAS.

07:50.903 --> 07:53.572
WE CAN TAKE THAT AND MONITOR ALL
OF THE CAMERAS AT THE SAME TIME.

07:53.607 --> 07:55.708
AND WE HAVE A LITTLE
FULL-SPECTRUM CAMERA

07:55.743 --> 07:57.374
THAT WE CAN USE,
WHICH IS GREAT.

07:57.409 --> 07:59.277
SO I'M THINKING
THAT WHATEVER IS HERE

07:59.312 --> 08:01.845
HAS NOT EVER HAD ANYBODY
TRY TO TALK TO THEM.

08:01.880 --> 08:04.683
SO I THINK WE SHOULD PROBABLY
GO AUDIO HEAVY, BIG-TIME.

08:04.684 --> 08:07.186
- YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
- SO WHERE DO YOU WANNA START?

08:07.221 --> 08:09.688
- WHERE DO YOU WANNA START?
- I WANT TO START UPSTAIRS.

08:09.723 --> 08:11.441
THERE'S LOTS OF ACTIVITY.

08:11.476 --> 08:13.159
AND THE SUICIDE WAS UP THERE.

08:13.194 --> 08:13.194
FOR SURE.

08:15.000 --> 08:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:22.567 --> 08:26.304
IF THERE'S SOMEONE IN HERE
WITH US, MY NAME IS AMY.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.838
MY NAME IS ADAM.

08:27.873 --> 08:31.909
AND YOU'VE PROBABLY NOTICED
US IN THE HOUSE ALL DAY.

08:31.910 --> 08:33.610
WE WERE HERE WITH MEGHAN.

08:33.645 --> 08:37.149
AND SHE'S ASKED US
TO COME HERE AND TALK TO YOU.

08:37.183 --> 08:40.886
WE WANNA MAKE IT
VERY CLEAR TO YOU

08:40.922 --> 08:43.807
THAT WE DON'T MEAN
ANY HARM TO YOU.

08:43.842 --> 08:46.657
AND OUR MAIN GOAL
IS TO FIND OUT

08:46.692 --> 08:50.996
IF SOMEONE IS TRYING
TO COMMUNICATE WITH MEGHAN.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.231
AND I KNOW THIS MIGHT
SEEM REALLY STRANGE.

08:53.266 --> 08:55.132
BUT WE CAN'T SEE YOU
OR HEAR YOU.

08:55.167 --> 08:58.103
IT'S VERY HARD FOR US
TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOU.

08:58.138 --> 09:00.540
DO YOU WANNA TALK TO US?

09:05.911 --> 09:08.345
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE

09:08.346 --> 09:11.617
SPECIFICALLY WHO MAY HAVE
LIVED HERE AT ONE POINT.

09:11.652 --> 09:15.753
MAYBE YOU LIVED HERE
WITH YOUR FAMILY.

09:15.754 --> 09:16.954
MAYBE YOU DON'T REALIZE

09:16.989 --> 09:20.826
THAT THIS HOUSE
BELONGS TO MEGHAN NOW.

09:23.863 --> 09:26.032
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S LISTEN TO THIS.

09:44.984 --> 09:46.584
YEAH. OKAY.

09:46.619 --> 09:48.587
THAT WASN'T ME TALKING.
IT WASN'T YOU TALKING.

09:48.622 --> 09:51.088
- I WOULD NEVER SAY NO TO YOU.
- NO.

09:51.123 --> 09:53.724
LIKE SOMEBODY
IS SAYING SOMETHING TO US.

09:53.759 --> 09:55.561
I MEAN, WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO PUT IT ON SOMETHING

09:55.596 --> 09:57.763
AND LISTEN TO IT
MORE CAREFULLY,

09:57.798 --> 09:59.931
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S IT'S SAYING.

09:59.932 --> 10:02.968
OKAY. WELL, WHY DON'T
WE EXPLORE THE ROOM?

10:03.003 --> 10:05.503
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKIN' AT?

10:09.608 --> 10:10.810
GOD!

10:19.418 --> 10:21.887
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKIN' AT?

10:21.922 --> 10:24.423
GOD!

10:26.925 --> 10:29.161
**** I THOUGHT
THAT WAS AN ANIMAL.

10:31.730 --> 10:33.014
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT THAT?

10:33.049 --> 10:34.264
- IT'S A TEDDY BEAR, RIGHT?
- I KNOW.

10:34.299 --> 10:35.966
BUT, LIKE,
WHY IS IT UP HERE?

10:36.001 --> 10:38.068
WHAT IF SHE DOESN'T
KNOW IT'S UP HERE?

10:38.103 --> 10:41.673
YOU THINK SHE BOUGHT THIS HOUSE
AND HAS NEVER ONCE LOOKED?

10:41.708 --> 10:44.108
- PUT IT BACK.
- THIS LOOKS REALLY OLD.

10:44.143 --> 10:46.378
MAYBE IT BELONGS
TO THE PREVIOUS OWNER.

10:46.413 --> 10:48.645
LET ME SEE.

10:48.680 --> 10:52.517
AND LOOK RIGHT HERE.

10:52.518 --> 10:55.353
RAT POOP, MOUSE POOP.
SO THERE WAS A MOUSE.

10:55.388 --> 10:56.620
THERE IS?

10:56.655 --> 10:58.189
WELL, YEAH, THERE'S
MOUSE POOP RIGHT THERE. LOOK.

10:58.190 --> 11:02.428
THE PRESENCE OF RODENTS
COULD EXPLAIN MEGHAN'S DOG

11:02.463 --> 11:04.764
GROWLING AT THE WALL
IN THE MASTER BEDROOM.

11:04.799 --> 11:07.065
IF A DOG HEARS OR SMELLS
ANYTHING LIKE THAT,

11:07.100 --> 11:08.432
IT'S GOING TO REACT.

11:08.467 --> 11:09.767
SO IF THE DOG
IS STARING AT THE WALL,

11:09.802 --> 11:11.337
AND IT HASN'T DONE IT AGAIN,
I WOULD ASSUME

11:11.372 --> 11:12.670
THAT IT'S GONNA BE
A RAT OR A RODENT.

11:16.875 --> 11:18.809
IT'S NOT PARANORMAL.

11:18.844 --> 11:20.911
- BUT WE CAUGHT THAT ONE VOICE.
- YEAH.

11:20.946 --> 11:25.150
AND WE HAVE NO IDEA
WHO THAT COULD BE YET.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.217
JUST TO COVER OUR BASES,

11:27.252 --> 11:31.390
I'D LOVE TO DO ONE EVP SESSION
WITH THAT PANASONIC IN HERE.

11:31.425 --> 11:34.894
IS THERE SOMEONE IN HERE WITH US
RIGHT NOW?

11:38.564 --> 11:42.800
ARE YOU SAD?

11:42.801 --> 11:45.071
DO YOU FEEL LOST?

11:47.439 --> 11:49.541
DO YOU HAVE FAMILY?

11:53.446 --> 11:55.948
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S LISTEN.

11:59.484 --> 12:00.684
I'M GONNA SIT.

12:00.719 --> 12:04.423
<i> IS THERE SOMEONE IN HERE
WITH US RIGHT NOW?</i>

12:07.793 --> 12:09.695
<i> ARE YOU SAD?</i>

12:11.730 --> 12:13.966
<i> DO YOU FEEL LOST?</i>

12:15.967 --> 12:17.770
<i> DO YOU HAVE FAMILY?</i>

12:19.872 --> 12:20.938
NOTHING.

12:20.973 --> 12:23.140
YOU WANNA GO
INTO THE KIDS' ROOMS?

12:23.175 --> 12:26.512
AND LET'S USE THAT RECORDER
AND SEE IF IT'S IN THERE, TOO.

12:32.151 --> 12:36.121
THIS IS AMY AND ADAM RECORDING
IN THE BEDROOM UPSTAIRS

12:36.156 --> 12:38.989
WHERE THE TOY FLEW.

12:39.024 --> 12:41.393
HOW MANY OF YOU ARE HERE?

12:45.230 --> 12:49.635
HOW MANY YEARS HAVE
YOU BEEN IN THIS HOUSE?

12:49.670 --> 12:52.170
DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN?

12:54.940 --> 12:57.009
ARE YOU MALE OR FEMALE?

13:02.214 --> 13:07.653
IF YOU'RE THROWING OBJECTS
TO GET MEGHAN'S ATTENTION,

13:07.688 --> 13:10.256
NOW IS THE TIME
TO DO IT FOR US.

13:15.393 --> 13:17.396
GET OUR ATTENTION
SOME OTHER WAY.

13:21.700 --> 13:23.602
COME ON.
WHERE ARE YOU?

13:28.373 --> 13:31.709
ON THE COUNT OF THREE...

13:31.744 --> 13:35.046
BE AS LOUD AS YOU CAN.

13:35.081 --> 13:39.752
ONE, TWO, THREE.

13:44.155 --> 13:46.024
IT'S NOT READY
FOR THOSE GAMES.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.777
NO, IT'S NOT.
TRY THAT THING.

13:47.812 --> 13:49.495
SEE IF WE GOT
ANYTHING ON THAT.

14:00.339 --> 14:03.606
- I'M HEARING A FEMALE VOICE.
- TALK, RIGHT.

14:03.641 --> 14:06.277
SOMETHING IS TALKING.

14:13.218 --> 14:15.620
IT'S VERY VOCAL. I JUST
DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S SAYING.

14:15.655 --> 14:17.988
I'VE NEVER HEARD THAT MUCH STUFF
COME OUT OF ONE.

14:18.023 --> 14:21.192
MAYBE WHEN WE HEAR IT
ON HEADPHONES, BE ABLE
TO HEAR IT BETTER.

14:21.227 --> 14:22.528
FOR SURE.

14:30.436 --> 14:32.504
WE DEFINITELY HAD A LOT
OF ACTIVITY TONIGHT,

14:32.539 --> 14:34.538
I MEAN, AND, SPECIFICALLY,
VOICES UPSTAIRS.

14:34.573 --> 14:37.442
BUT NOTHING REALLY CONNECTS
TO WHO IS HAUNTING THIS HOUSE

14:37.477 --> 14:39.478
OR TO THE ACTIVITY
THAT'S ON THE FIRST FLOOR

14:39.513 --> 14:41.814
OR THE SHADOW FIGURE
IN THE BASEMENT.

14:44.249 --> 14:45.715
IT'S REALLY HARD
TO PINPOINT

14:45.750 --> 14:47.418
WHAT THE ACTIVITY
IS COMING FROM.

14:47.453 --> 14:49.554
IT COULD BE THE TRAGEDY
THAT HAPPENED HERE

14:49.589 --> 14:50.872
RIGHT BEFORE SHE MOVED IN.

14:50.907 --> 14:52.156
AND THERE'S SO MANY THINGS.

14:52.157 --> 14:53.523
THIS WHOLE BOX OF STUFF,

14:53.558 --> 14:56.527
ALL OF THOSE PICTURES
OVER THERE, ALL THE APPLIANCES,

14:56.562 --> 14:59.130
LIKE, ALL OF THESE THINGS
COME FROM THAT OTHER FAMILY.

14:59.165 --> 15:01.699
AND THEY HAVEN'T PICKED THEM UP.
AND ALL THESE OBJECTS

15:01.700 --> 15:03.199
ARE LITERALLY HERE
IN THE BASEMENT.

15:03.234 --> 15:05.670
YEAH. BUT THERE COULD
BE MORE TO IT THAN JUST THAT.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.104
I MEAN,
WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING

15:07.139 --> 15:09.341
ABOUT THIS HOUSE, PRIOR
TO THE PREVIOUS HOMEOWNER.

15:09.376 --> 15:11.577
THE LAND, THE HOUSE,
WHAT WAS NEXT DOOR,

15:11.612 --> 15:12.976
WHAT WAS
ACROSS THE STREET.

15:13.011 --> 15:14.878
WE ALSO DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE STORY

15:14.913 --> 15:17.115
BEHIND THAT CREEPY ROOM IS,
WHICH IS WHY

15:17.150 --> 15:19.050
WE HAVE TO HAMMER
INTO THE HISTORY

15:19.085 --> 15:20.618
OF THIS HOUSE
AND THE AREA

15:20.619 --> 15:23.956
AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT ELSE IT COULD BE.

15:34.900 --> 15:36.735
WE'RE DESPERATELY
TRYING TO FIND ANSWERS

15:36.770 --> 15:37.935
ON THE HISTORY OF THE HOUSE,

15:37.970 --> 15:39.803
TALKING TO NEIGHBORS
AND HISTORIANS.

15:39.838 --> 15:43.341
HI. I'M TRYING TO FIND SOME
INFORMATION ABOUT A PROPERTY.

15:43.376 --> 15:48.147
SO, WE ARE INVESTIGATING,
GHOSTS.

15:48.182 --> 15:50.683
AND WE -- HELLO?

15:50.718 --> 15:53.150
SHE HUNG UP ON ME.

15:53.185 --> 15:54.985
WE STILL NEED
THAT INFORMATION.

15:55.020 --> 15:56.786
SO WE ARE GOING
RIGHT TO THE SOURCE.

15:56.821 --> 15:59.758
WE WERE ABLE TO CONVINCE THE
DAUGHTER OF THE FORMER HOMEOWNER

15:59.793 --> 16:02.961
TO COME BACK TO THE HOUSE
AND SPEAK WITH US.

16:02.996 --> 16:05.847
MEGHAN CAME TO US
BECAUSE SHE WAS

16:05.882 --> 16:08.699
JUST CONCERNED
ABOUT SOME ACTIVITY

16:08.700 --> 16:10.067
SHE'S BEEN EXPERIENCING
IN THE HOUSE.

16:10.102 --> 16:13.704
WE'RE JUST COMING IN TO TRY
TO FIGURE OUT WHO IT IS.

16:13.705 --> 16:17.208
AND HER MAIN CONCERN
WAS THAT IT WAS YOUR MOM.

16:17.243 --> 16:20.712
THERE -- THERE HAS BEEN
SOME PARANORMAL STUFF.

16:20.747 --> 16:23.146
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

16:23.181 --> 16:25.550
I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE
THAT SHE'S NOT IN THE HOUSE

16:25.585 --> 16:27.885
AND NOT TRYING
TO REACH OUT TO EVERYONE

16:27.920 --> 16:32.056
BECAUSE I WAS FREAKIN' OUT,
THINKIN', "IS SHE OKAY?"

16:32.057 --> 16:34.058
UM, WHEN YOU LIVED HERE,

16:34.093 --> 16:37.095
DID YOU GUYS EVER HAVE
ANYTHING WEIRD HAPPEN?

16:37.130 --> 16:40.098
EVERY DAY I LIVED HERE,
I HAD THAT PROBLEM.

16:40.133 --> 16:41.297
REALLY?

16:41.332 --> 16:43.201
THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES
WHERE I WAS HERE ALONE,

16:43.236 --> 16:44.834
AND IT FELT LIKE THERE
WAS SOMEONE HERE.

16:44.869 --> 16:48.006
WE ACTUALLY --
THERE'S A ROOM IN THE BASEMENT.

16:48.041 --> 16:49.472
WE CALL IT THE SCARY ROOM.

16:49.507 --> 16:52.978
ALL RIGHT.
SO THIS IS THE BASEMENT.

16:53.013 --> 16:54.479
NOW THAT WE KNOW
THAT AT LEAST

16:54.480 --> 16:57.182
THE BASEMENT ACTIVITY PREDATES
THE PREVIOUS FAMILY,

16:57.217 --> 16:59.549
WE REALLY HAVE TO FIND OUT
MORE ABOUT IT.

16:59.584 --> 17:03.354
THIS SECTION OVER HERE,
IF YOU GO THROUGH THIS DOOR...

17:03.355 --> 17:05.189
SO I GOT AHOLD OF
A LOCAL HISTORIAN

17:05.223 --> 17:07.290
WHO KNOWS ABOUT THE AREA.

17:07.326 --> 17:10.095
I'D LOVE FOR YOU
TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

17:16.101 --> 17:18.869
IT LOOKS LIKE IT --
IT COULD BE,

17:18.905 --> 17:21.638
EARLY TO MID
TO EVEN LATE 1800s.

17:21.640 --> 17:25.708
UM, COULD HAVE POSSIBLY
BEEN A ROOT CELLAR.

17:25.742 --> 17:28.347
SO HOW OFTEN DO YOU SEE,
LIKE, A SIDE ROOM LIKE THIS?

17:28.382 --> 17:29.715
NOT -- NOT OFTEN AT ALL.

17:29.750 --> 17:29.750
YEAH.

17:32.684 --> 17:36.221
IT -- IT'S UNUSUAL TO HAVE
A SIDE ROOM THIS DEEP.

17:38.290 --> 17:40.658
WHY WOULD THERE BE
A ROOM LIKE THIS?

17:42.628 --> 17:44.129
THIS IS MUCH MORE
THAN A CRAWLSPACE.

17:58.877 --> 18:03.181
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN TELL
HOW OLD THIS SECTION IS.

18:03.216 --> 18:04.447
IT LOOKS LIKE IT --

18:04.482 --> 18:09.087
IT COULD BE, EARLY TO MID
TO EVEN LATE 1800s.

18:09.122 --> 18:11.721
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD
USED TO BE --

18:11.756 --> 18:15.193
IT'S KIND OF A HOTBED
FOR THE ABOLITIONIST MOVEMENT.

18:15.228 --> 18:17.060
THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD,

18:17.095 --> 18:19.297
THE RUNAWAY SLAVES --
PEOPLE, WOULD TAKE THEM IN,

18:19.332 --> 18:21.667
TRY TO KEEP THEM
UNDER WRAPS A BIT.

18:21.702 --> 18:23.967
DO YOU THINK THAT THIS HOUSE

18:24.002 --> 18:29.139
COULD EVER HAVE BEEN USED
IN THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD?

18:29.140 --> 18:31.843
WITH A SPACE LIKE THIS,
IT CERTAINLY COULD HAVE.

18:31.878 --> 18:33.576
THERE'S ENOUGH ROOM HERE
TO, YOU KNOW,

18:33.611 --> 18:36.348
TO PUT PEOPLE IN AND --
AND TAKE CARE OF 'EM.

18:36.383 --> 18:39.418
IT'S, ENOUGH
HEAD HEIGHT IN THERE

18:39.453 --> 18:42.419
SO THAT PEOPLE AREN'T
JUST CRAWLING IN.

18:42.454 --> 18:47.126
IF I WANTED TO HIDE SOMEBODY,
THIS WOULD BE A GOOD SPOT.

18:47.161 --> 18:49.293
THIS IS MUCH MORE
THAN A CRAWLSPACE.

18:56.534 --> 18:58.570
I WAS TALKING
TO A LOCAL HISTORIAN.

18:58.605 --> 19:00.136
YEAH.
HOW DID THAT GO?

19:00.171 --> 19:03.006
AND THIS HOUSE
IS OLDER THAN 1890.

19:03.041 --> 19:06.477
HE WAS SHOWING ME THE SURVEYS
OF THE PROPERTIES NEARBY,

19:06.478 --> 19:09.931
AND HE EXPLAINED TO ME
THAT THESE OLDER HOMES, UM,

19:09.966 --> 19:12.726
SOME OF THEM, LIKE,
I PERSON WOULD BUILD A HOUSE,

19:12.761 --> 19:15.451
THEY'D OWN THE PROPERTY,
THEY'D BUILD A HOUSE,

19:15.486 --> 19:17.854
AND THEY WOULD DEED THAT HOUSE
SO YOU'D KNOW THE DATE,

19:17.889 --> 19:19.558
BUT THEN THEY WOULD JUST BUILD
OTHER HOUSES ON THE PROPERTY

19:19.593 --> 19:20.924
FOR, LIKE, THEIR FAMILY.
- YEAH.

19:20.959 --> 19:25.013
THOSE HOUSES, YOU
WOULDN'T REALLY KNOW
WHEN THEY WERE BUILT.

19:25.048 --> 19:29.067
IF YOU LOOK AT THE SURVEYS,
EVERY HOUSE IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD

19:29.102 --> 19:31.136
WAS BUILT LATE 1700s,

19:31.171 --> 19:33.136
EARLY TO MID 1800s.

19:33.171 --> 19:34.873
I THINK THE HOUSE HAS BEEN HERE

19:34.908 --> 19:35.740
FOR LONGER.

19:37.075 --> 19:38.942
I MEAN,
THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR,

19:38.977 --> 19:42.414
WHICH IS ALMOST IDENTICAL
TO IT, RIGHT HERE...

19:42.449 --> 19:45.783
- YEAH.
- ...WAS BUILT IN 1765.

19:45.818 --> 19:48.218
SO THAT MAKES COMPLETE --

19:48.253 --> 19:51.789
AND THERE IS THAT WHOLE SIDE
CELLAR ROOM IN THE BASEMENT.

19:51.824 --> 19:54.626
YEAH, THE WEIRD, CREEPY ROOM
WITH THE CHAIR.

19:54.661 --> 19:55.792
THE CREEPY ROOM.
RIGHT?

19:55.827 --> 19:57.227
YEAH.
THE WEIRD, CREEPY ROOM.

19:57.262 --> 19:59.496
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU
USUALLY FIND IN BASEMENTS HERE,

19:59.497 --> 20:00.831
ACCORDING TO THE HISTORIAN.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.465
HE HAD NO IDEA
WHAT IT MIGHT BE?

20:02.500 --> 20:05.770
HE WAS, LIKE, MAYBE IT WAS
THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.372
LET'S FOCUS ON
THE BASEMENT TONIGHT.

20:07.407 --> 20:09.675
LET'S DO IT. I'M DOWN.

20:09.710 --> 20:09.710
OKAY.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.390
SO WHOEVER'S
DOWN HERE WITH US,

20:26.425 --> 20:29.661
CAN YOU JUST LET US KNOW
THAT YOU'RE HERE SOMEHOW?

20:29.696 --> 20:32.898
BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY
WOULD LOVE TO TALK TO YOU.

20:35.367 --> 20:37.934
OKAY, TWICE NOW,
I'M NOT KIDDING,

20:37.969 --> 20:43.375
I SAW LIKE SOMETHING LIKE A DARK
SHADOW MOVING OVER THERE...

20:45.977 --> 20:48.547
...HIGH ENOUGH
TO BLOCK THAT OUT.

20:48.582 --> 20:50.482
OKAY.

20:50.517 --> 20:52.382
WEIRD.

20:52.417 --> 20:55.151
TWICE.
I SAW IT THE FIRST TIME,

20:55.152 --> 20:56.319
AND I WAS LIKE, ""

20:56.354 --> 20:58.023
- AND THEN IT HAPPENED AGAIN.
- WAIT, HERE?

20:58.058 --> 21:01.091
- SEE, WHAT IS THAT?
- YEAH,

21:01.092 --> 21:04.630
I SAW SOMETHING GO
IN FRONT OF THAT TWICE.

21:08.566 --> 21:10.836
I'M GONNA COME OVER HERE
ON THIS SIDE TO SEE.

21:10.871 --> 21:12.070
I SEE
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

21:12.105 --> 21:15.006
HEY, WHOEVER YOU ARE,

21:15.007 --> 21:18.109
YOU DON'T NEED TO HIDE ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BASEMENT.

21:18.144 --> 21:20.312
YOU CAN BE NEARER TO US.

21:25.683 --> 21:28.086
ARE YOU TRYING
TO ESCAPE SOMETHING?

21:30.088 --> 21:31.923
ARE YOU ANGRY?

21:34.225 --> 21:36.762
ARE YOU LOST?

21:43.568 --> 21:46.004
DO YOU EVEN
WANNA TALK TO US?

21:46.838 --> 21:49.274
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S LISTEN.

22:07.125 --> 22:09.394
NOTHING.

22:11.463 --> 22:14.331
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD
SHIFT FOCUS TO UPSTAIRS.

22:14.332 --> 22:16.166
RIGHT NOW
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE

22:16.201 --> 22:17.767
WHATEVER'S HERE
DOES NOT WANNA TALK TO US.

22:17.802 --> 22:19.870
WE'VE GOT CAMERAS.
IF WE'RE GONNA CATCH ANYTHING,

22:19.871 --> 22:21.606
IT'S NOT GONNA BE
WHEN WE'RE DOWN HERE.

22:25.643 --> 22:28.313
ARE YOU HERE?
AND DO YOU WANNA TALK TO US?

22:38.390 --> 22:40.723
WHAT?

22:40.758 --> 22:43.361
THIS CAMERA DOWN
IN THE BASEMENT JUST TILTED.

22:43.396 --> 22:44.660
IT DID?

22:44.695 --> 22:46.831
LIKE, I DON'T SEE THE TOP
OF THIS DOOR ANYMORE.

22:46.832 --> 22:48.233
LIKE, YOU SAW IT TILT?

22:48.268 --> 22:50.769
YEP, I SAW IT MOVE DOWN.

22:50.804 --> 22:52.704
LIKE, I JUST SAW IT.

22:52.739 --> 22:54.570
IT JUST DID IT AGAIN!

22:54.605 --> 22:58.309
I MEAN, THAT CAMERA WAS THERE
FOR LIKE HOURS.

22:58.344 --> 23:02.013
FOR HOURS. I NEED TO GO SEE.
I NEED TO GO.

23:02.048 --> 23:04.099
WE NEED TO GO SEE IT.
WE NEED TO GO.

23:04.134 --> 23:06.151
LET'S GO SEE
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

23:11.722 --> 23:15.058
- I MEAN, HONESTLY, OKAY.
- IT'S ON THERE.

23:15.093 --> 23:17.027
OKAY. IT IS ON THERE.

23:17.062 --> 23:19.598
THERE'S NO WAY.
THERE'S NO WAY.

23:19.633 --> 23:22.134
LET ME SEE IF
I CAN TRY TO DO IT.

23:24.669 --> 23:27.005
I MEAN, LIKE,
THAT'S HARDCORE PUSHING IT.

23:27.040 --> 23:28.104
YEAH.

23:28.139 --> 23:30.207
THERE IS NO WAY
IT MOVED ON ITS OWN.

23:33.978 --> 23:36.347
WELL, ALL WE CAN DO
IS LEAVE IT LIKE THIS AGAIN

23:36.382 --> 23:37.416
AND SEE
IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN.

23:39.818 --> 23:43.238
LET ME START THIS AGAIN.
YOU WATCH THAT.

23:43.273 --> 23:46.658
AND LET'S SEE IF WE CAN GET
SOME REACTIONS.

23:46.693 --> 23:50.459
OKAY. WE'RE BACK.
UM...

23:50.494 --> 23:53.965
WE JUST WANTED TO KNOW IF THAT
WAS YOU GETTING OUR ATTENTION.

23:57.502 --> 23:58.936
IF YOU COULD DO IT AGAIN...

23:58.971 --> 24:00.572
WAS THAT YOU?

24:04.075 --> 24:09.414
IS THERE A REASON WHY YOU'VE
CHOSEN TO BE HERE WITH MEGHAN?

24:13.651 --> 24:16.221
CAN YOU JUST LET US KNOW
THAT YOU'RE HERE?

24:19.824 --> 24:22.360
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S LISTEN TO THIS.

24:41.345 --> 24:43.882
WE GOT NOTHING.

24:55.993 --> 25:00.764
UM, LITERALLY
FULL-ON VOICE.

25:09.106 --> 25:13.176
UM, LITERALLY
FULL-ON VOICE.

25:13.211 --> 25:17.247
LIKE,
THE STRONGEST EVP.

25:17.248 --> 25:19.284
THE FIRST THING THAT
YOU'RE GONNA LISTEN TO

25:19.319 --> 25:21.018
WAS IN THE ROOM
THAT WE STARTED IN.

25:21.053 --> 25:22.453
SHE MOVED IN THERE FIRST.

25:22.488 --> 25:23.819
- WHERE SHE HEARD THE KNOCK.
- RIGHT, THE KNOCKING.

25:23.854 --> 25:25.490
AND THEN
SHE MOVED OUT OF IT.

25:30.328 --> 25:32.163
GO BACK.

25:35.333 --> 25:37.333
"NO."
IT'S A MALE VOICE SAYING NO.

25:37.368 --> 25:40.572
CAUSE WE ASKED, "DO YOU WANNA
TALK TO US?" IT'S LIKE, "NO."

25:40.607 --> 25:42.706
THAT'S INTERESTING
BECAUSE THE OTHER STUFF

25:42.707 --> 25:45.493
THAT'S HAPPENING ARE
POINTING TOWARDS A FEMALE.

25:45.528 --> 25:48.280
SO THAT MAKES YOU WONDER
IF THERE'S MORE THAN ONE.

25:49.781 --> 25:52.450
I FEEL, BASED ON WHAT
WE'RE EXPERIENCING,

25:52.485 --> 25:54.317
FEMALE ENTITIES ARE IN HERE.

25:54.352 --> 25:55.819
HERE, PUT THAT ON.

25:55.854 --> 25:57.788
SO THIS --
WE WERE IN THE KIDS' ROOM

25:57.823 --> 25:59.424
WHERE THE TOY WAS THROWN.

26:02.393 --> 26:05.297
LISTEN TO THIS ONE
AND TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK.

26:09.366 --> 26:10.533
YOU HEAR THAT?

26:10.568 --> 26:13.538
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
"MEGHAN."

26:18.541 --> 26:18.541
FEMALE.

26:18.576 --> 26:21.145
YEAH. IT'S A FEMALE.

26:21.180 --> 26:23.679
IT -- YEAH, 100%. RIGHT.

26:23.714 --> 26:26.684
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
I'M WRITING THIS DOWN.

26:26.719 --> 26:28.518
THIS EVP IS HUGE.

26:28.553 --> 26:30.220
THE FACT
THAT IT SAYS "MEGHAN"

26:30.255 --> 26:32.589
TELLS US THAT IT'S
FAMILIAR WITH HER.

26:32.624 --> 26:35.259
SO WE NEED TO GET HER
BACK IN HERE A.S.A.P.

26:35.294 --> 26:37.895
WE NEED TO DIG INTO
THE FAMILY A LITTLE MORE,

26:37.930 --> 26:39.297
MAYBE ASK SOME QUESTIONS.

26:48.272 --> 26:51.442
THE MEGHAN EVP IS THE FIRST
SPECIFIC CLUE WE'VE HAD.

26:51.477 --> 26:54.612
SO WHILE ADAM TALKS TO
MEGHAN'S FATHER AND SISTER...

26:54.647 --> 26:56.148
- KEVIN, RIGHT?
- YES.

26:56.183 --> 26:57.614
- KEVIN, DANA.
- YES.

26:57.649 --> 27:00.517
...I'M GONNA SIT DOWN
WITH MEGHAN AND SEE
WHAT I CAN FIND OUT.

27:00.518 --> 27:04.088
I JUST WANT TO TALK TO YOU MORE
ABOUT WHAT COULD BE HERE.

27:04.123 --> 27:07.659
AS FAR AS YOUR FAMILY GOES,
ARE THERE ANY DEATHS OR ANYBODY

27:07.694 --> 27:10.394
THAT MIGHT WANNA BE
POPPING IN TO SAY HI

27:10.429 --> 27:11.661
THAT YOU CAN THINK OF?

27:11.696 --> 27:14.331
WELL, MY GRANDMOTHER,
NANA O'CONNOR,

27:14.332 --> 27:16.367
PASSED AWAY
A COUPLE YEARS AGO.

27:16.402 --> 27:18.402
SHE MIGHT BE
A POSSIBILITY.

27:20.171 --> 27:21.972
NANA WAS GOOD
TO ALL OF US.

27:22.007 --> 27:23.739
YES, VERY STRONG
PERSONALITY.

27:23.774 --> 27:26.142
IF SHE HAD SOMETHIN'
TO SAY, IT WAS SAID.

27:26.143 --> 27:28.913
AND SO I THINK THAT
THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON

27:28.948 --> 27:31.082
OR SHE WANTS TO MAKE
HERSELF KNOWN.

27:31.117 --> 27:33.216
- SHE'LL -- SHE'LL DO THAT.
- RIGHT.

27:33.251 --> 27:36.352
NANA, UM, AND I WERE
VERY CLOSE.

27:36.387 --> 27:39.590
SO TIME FRAME-WISE,
SHE WOULD HAVE NEVER VISITED

27:39.625 --> 27:41.091
OR LIVED WITH YOU
IN THE HOUSE?

27:41.092 --> 27:43.360
NO.
BUT WHEN SHE PASSED AWAY,

27:43.395 --> 27:45.597
SHE LEFT BEHIND
A LOT OF STUFF.

27:45.632 --> 27:46.715
AND THEY'RE HERE IN THE HOUSE?

27:46.750 --> 27:47.799
THEY'RE HERE IN THE HOUSE.

27:47.834 --> 27:49.232
OKAY.

27:49.267 --> 27:51.068
ALL THOSE KNICKKNACKS
WAS MY GRANDMOTHER'S.

27:51.103 --> 27:53.102
SHE MADE THEM.

27:53.137 --> 27:56.139
MY MOTHER KEPT GOING
INTO THE POTTERY CLASSES.

27:56.140 --> 27:58.810
SO WE WOULD ALL, FOR
CHRISTMAS AND OUR BIRTHDAYS,

27:58.845 --> 28:02.080
GET SOME KIND OF
POTTERY GIFT, YOU KNOW?

28:02.115 --> 28:04.447
FOR ME, HAVING THINGS

28:04.482 --> 28:09.253
FROM MY DECEASED
FAMILY MEMBERS, IT --

28:09.288 --> 28:11.756
IT HELPS TO KEEP THEM
CLOSE TO ME

28:11.791 --> 28:14.190
AND THEM STILL BEING
HERE IN MY LIFE.

28:14.225 --> 28:16.526
EVEN THOUGH NANA
DIDN'T DIE ON THE PROPERTY,

28:16.527 --> 28:19.063
SHE COULD VERY WELL STILL BE
CONNECTED TO THIS HOUSE,

28:19.098 --> 28:21.632
ESPECIALLY WITH SO MANY
OF HER BELONGINGS HERE.

28:21.667 --> 28:23.132
MOST HOUSES YOU MOVE IN,
THEY'RE EMPTY.

28:23.167 --> 28:26.103
THIS HOUSE HAS LOTS OF THINGS
FROM DIFFERENT PEOPLE,

28:26.104 --> 28:28.689
INCLUDING, VERY DEAR
RELATIVES OF MEGHAN'S,

28:28.724 --> 28:31.240
THINGS THAT BELONGED
TO THE PREVIOUS HOMEOWNER.

28:31.275 --> 28:34.394
THERE ARE OBJECTS WE DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHO THEY BELONG TO.

28:34.429 --> 28:37.514
SO MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING
ATTACHED TO ITEMS IN THE HOUSE

28:37.515 --> 28:39.284
RATHER THAN THE HOUSE ITSELF.

28:44.922 --> 28:47.225
WE'RE GOING TO TALK
TO TWO PEOPLE, GREG AND DANA.

28:47.260 --> 28:49.026
THESE ARE COLLEAGUES OF OURS

28:49.027 --> 28:50.793
WHO'VE BEEN WORKING
WITH HAUNTED OBJECTS.

28:50.828 --> 28:53.147
THIS IS WHAT THEIR LIFE'S WORK
IS AT THIS POINT.

28:53.182 --> 28:55.431
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
SOME OF THE ACTIVITY

28:55.466 --> 29:00.137
COULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF
THE BELONGINGS OF OUR CLIENTS.

29:00.172 --> 29:01.271
<i> FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS,</i>

29:01.306 --> 29:02.940
<i> WE'VE BEEN COLLECTING
AND RESEARCHING</i>

29:02.975 --> 29:04.707
<i> HAUNTED OBJECTS,
CURSED ITEMS,</i>

29:04.742 --> 29:08.110
<i> AND OTHERWISE SUPERNATURALLY
INFLUENCED ARTIFACTS.</i>

29:08.145 --> 29:12.116
<i> WE HAVE ONE PIECE IN PARTICULAR
IN THE COLLECTION, RUBY.</i>

29:12.151 --> 29:14.250
<i> WE HAVE A DOLL
WHO WE CALL RUBY,</i>

29:14.285 --> 29:17.488
<i> AND WHEN SHE WAS GIVEN TO US,
THE FAMILY WHO GAVE IT TO US</i>

29:17.523 --> 29:19.908
<i> CLAIMED THAT THE DOLL
WAS ACTUALLY HAUNTED.</i>

29:19.943 --> 29:22.258
<i> SO, THIS DOLL WAS BASICALLY
A FAMILY HEIRLOOM,</i>

29:22.293 --> 29:25.228
<i> AND IT WAS SORT OF PASSED DOWN
FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION,</i>

29:25.229 --> 29:27.463
<i> FAMILY MEMBER
TO FAMILY MEMBER.</i>

29:27.498 --> 29:31.267
<i> THE STRANGE THING ABOUT
RUBY WAS THE FAMILY
THAT HAD OWNED HER,</i>

29:31.302 --> 29:35.606
<i> THEY BELIEVED THAT IT WAS
ACTUALLY THE LITTLE GIRL
WHO OWNED RUBY AT ONE TIME</i>

29:35.641 --> 29:37.158
<i> THAT HAUNTED THE DOLL.</i>

29:37.193 --> 29:38.641
<i> AND THERE WERE A LOT OF</i>

29:38.676 --> 29:41.429
<i> SORT OF NEGATIVE ASSOCIATIONS
WITH THIS DOLL,</i>

29:41.464 --> 29:44.182
<i> SO EVENTUALLY, IT WAS ACTUALLY
FRIGHTENING THEM.</i>

29:44.217 --> 29:45.748
<i> AND THAT'S WHY,
INEVITABLY,</i>

29:45.783 --> 29:47.819
<i> THEY ENDED UP BRINGING THE DOLL
TO US.</i>

29:47.854 --> 29:49.418
WHAT --
WHAT IS YOUR PROTOCOL?

29:49.453 --> 29:51.572
WHAT DO YOU DO
WHEN YOU INVESTIGATE

29:51.607 --> 29:53.656
WHAT YOU THINK
TO BE A HAUNTED OBJECT?

29:53.691 --> 29:55.976
<i> WELL, THE FIRST THING
THAT WE DO IS WE PUT IT</i>

29:56.011 --> 29:58.262
<i> UNDER SURVEILLANCE
AS LONG AS WE POSSIBLY CAN.</i>

29:58.297 --> 29:59.429
<i> THAT WAY, YOU CAN TELL</i>

29:59.430 --> 30:01.597
<i> IF SOMETHING STRANGE
IS STARTING TO HAPPEN.</i>

30:01.632 --> 30:03.768
<i> BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE THINGS
KINDA MOVE ON THEIR OWN.</i>

30:03.803 --> 30:05.670
<i> AND OBVIOUSLY
WE WANT TO LOOK</i>

30:05.705 --> 30:07.639
<i> FOR ELECTROMAGNETIC
FLUCTUATIONS.</i>

30:07.674 --> 30:09.538
<i> WE WANNA DO
EVP SESSIONS.</i>

30:09.573 --> 30:11.325
<i> SOME OF THEM ACTUALLY
COME THROUGH.</i>

30:11.360 --> 30:13.203
I DON'T WANT --
I DON'T WANNA INTERRUPT YOU.

30:13.238 --> 30:15.046
DO YOU HEAR THAT
KNOCKING THAT'S HAPPENING?

30:20.317 --> 30:22.353
<i> -THAT'S INTERESTING.</i>
- IT'S, LIKE, THIS, LIKE --

30:22.388 --> 30:23.653
IT'S BEEN GOING ON
EVER SINCE

30:23.688 --> 30:25.256
YOU'VE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT THINGS BEING ATTACHED.

30:25.291 --> 30:27.425
<i> INTERESTING.</i>

30:30.094 --> 30:31.260
WHAT WAS THAT?

30:31.295 --> 30:33.998
I'M SORRY.
I HAVE TO GET UP.

30:40.505 --> 30:42.504
WAS IT THE TRUNK?

30:42.539 --> 30:43.973
WAS IT THE WIND
KNOCKING ON THE BLINDS?

30:44.008 --> 30:45.810
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
MAYBE IT WAS THIS.

30:45.845 --> 30:49.513
BUT IT'S NOT --
THEY'RE NOT TOUCHING.

30:49.548 --> 30:52.314
NO. NO. NO WAY.

30:52.349 --> 30:54.634
IT WAS LIKE
A LITTLE KNOCKING.

30:54.669 --> 30:56.919
JUST A KNOCK,
KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK.

30:56.920 --> 31:01.091
TO ME, IT SOUNDED ALMOST LIKE
IT WAS COMING FROM THIS AREA,

31:01.126 --> 31:05.263
WHICH IS WEIRD 'CAUSE WE WERE
TALKING ABOUT THE HAUNTED STUFF.

31:05.298 --> 31:07.397
- WAS IT SOMETHING LIKE THIS?
- ALMOST, YEAH.

31:07.432 --> 31:09.767
GO SIT IN THERE AND SEE
IF THIS IS WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE.

31:09.802 --> 31:13.671
OKAY, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

31:13.706 --> 31:17.674
- YEAH, YES, 100%
- REALLY?

31:17.709 --> 31:20.478
IT'S THE SAME --
IT IS THE SAME **** SOUND.

31:25.483 --> 31:30.154
WHAT WAS THAT?
HEY. WAS IT SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

31:33.257 --> 31:36.260
YES, 100%.
IT IS THE SAME **** SOUND.

31:36.295 --> 31:38.561
DO YOU WANNA KNOW
WHAT IT IS?

31:38.596 --> 31:41.932
EVERY HAIR ON MY BODY
IS STANDING UP RIGHT NOW.

31:41.967 --> 31:45.836
IT'S HER
GRANDMOTHER'S BELLS.

31:45.871 --> 31:48.403
THAT'S INSANE.

31:48.438 --> 31:51.207
THIS IS WHY WE CALLED YOU.

31:51.242 --> 31:53.676
<i> WHOO. THOSE WERE
MAKING THE NOISE?</i>

31:53.711 --> 31:58.449
IT'S ALMOST LIKE IT WANTS HER
TO KNOW THAT IT'S HER,

31:58.484 --> 31:59.715
THAT IT'S THIS PERSON.

31:59.750 --> 32:01.385
<i> A LOT OF THE TIMES,
THOSE OBJECTS</i>

32:01.420 --> 32:02.985
<i> ARE SOME OF
THE MOST ACTIVE OBJECTS</i>

32:03.020 --> 32:06.423
<i> BECAUSE THEY LITERALLY --
SOMEONE SPENT HOURS WITH THAT.</i>

32:06.458 --> 32:07.657
<i> IT'S A PIECE OF THEM.</i>

32:07.692 --> 32:09.827
<i> IT IS, REALLY, I MEAN,
BOTTOM LINE, YEAH.</i>

32:09.862 --> 32:12.630
I'M STILL, LIKE,
ALL GOOSEBUMP-Y.

32:12.665 --> 32:14.097
MY GOD.

32:14.132 --> 32:16.600
THE FACT THAT SOMETHING
THAT BELONGED TO HER GRANDMOTHER

32:16.635 --> 32:18.467
IS ACTUALLY
WHAT MOVED FOR US,

32:18.502 --> 32:20.271
IT WAS ALMOST AS THOUGH
SOMETHING WAS LISTENING

32:20.306 --> 32:22.238
TO US AND WAS LIKE,
"YOU'RE RIGHT.

32:22.273 --> 32:25.043
YOU'RE GOING DOWN THE RIGHT
PATH. I'M RIGHT HERE."

32:31.816 --> 32:34.185
I REALLY WANNA BRING MEGHAN
INTO THE INVESTIGATION

32:34.220 --> 32:36.587
WITH US TONIGHT
BECAUSE IT'S HER GRANDMOTHER.

32:36.622 --> 32:37.987
IT'S HER CONNECTIONS.

32:38.022 --> 32:41.125
SO WE MIGHT GET MORE ACTIVITY
IF SHE'S HERE WITH US.

32:45.196 --> 32:47.563
WE HAD SOMETHING
REALLY CRAZY HAPPEN.

32:47.598 --> 32:50.401
AS WE'VE BEEN INVESTIGATING,
WE STARTED WONDERING

32:50.436 --> 32:54.837
IF IT MIGHT BE
SOMEONE CONNECTED TO YOU.

32:54.872 --> 32:57.708
THIS MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO
WITH SOME OF YOUR POSSESSIONS.

32:57.743 --> 32:59.508
SO WE CALLED OUR FRIENDS.

32:59.543 --> 33:04.314
THEY ARE BASICALLY,
EXPERTS IN HAUNTED OBJECTS.

33:04.315 --> 33:05.648
AND WE'RE CHATTING WITH THEM.

33:05.683 --> 33:08.184
AND WE'RE ASKING THEM
ABOUT WHETHER ANY OF THE THINGS

33:08.219 --> 33:10.688
YOU HAD WE THOUGHT MIGHT HAVE
SOME SORT OF ATTACHMENT TO THEM.

33:10.723 --> 33:12.154
AND AS WE WERE DOING THAT,

33:12.189 --> 33:14.558
WE STARTED HEARING MOVEMENT
RIGHT HERE

33:14.593 --> 33:17.993
- ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS WALL.
- AND IT WAS THERE.

33:18.028 --> 33:20.429
IT TURNS OUT IT WAS THESE.

33:20.464 --> 33:23.367
NOW, DO YOU KNOW
WHO OWNED THOSE THINGS?

33:23.402 --> 33:25.300
NANA.

33:25.335 --> 33:27.004
SO FUNNY BECAUSE
WE WERE TALKING,

33:27.039 --> 33:29.004
ABOUT HAUNTED OBJECTS.

33:29.039 --> 33:30.941
AND IT WAS ALMOST LIKE
WHATEVER WAS LIKE,

33:30.976 --> 33:34.479
"YES. YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE RIGHT."

33:34.514 --> 33:35.678
WE HAVE SOME,
YOU KNOW,

33:35.713 --> 33:37.880
BELONGINGS IN HERE
THAT WE KNOW BELONG TO NANA.

33:37.881 --> 33:39.866
AND THEN WE HAVE SOME
BELONGINGS IN HERE

33:39.901 --> 33:41.852
THAT BELONG TO,
THE PREVIOUS HOMEOWNER.

33:41.887 --> 33:43.638
SO WE JUST WANTED
TO GET TOGETHER

33:43.673 --> 33:45.354
SO THAT WE CAN
INVESTIGATE WITH YOU.

33:45.389 --> 33:48.324
WE REALLY NEED YOU
TO HELP US REACH OUT TO NANA.

33:48.325 --> 33:49.209
SURE.

33:49.244 --> 33:50.059
LET'S GO.

33:50.094 --> 33:51.429
LET'S PUT THESE BACK.

33:51.464 --> 33:52.764
I'M GONNA TAKE THIS.

33:59.303 --> 34:00.569
WE HAVE THE OBJECTS HERE.

34:00.604 --> 34:02.873
WE HAVE A GEOPHONE HERE,
WHICH MEASURES THREE THINGS --

34:02.908 --> 34:04.740
EMF, VIBRATION,
AND TEMPERATURE.

34:04.775 --> 34:06.960
WE'VE GOT A CAMERA ON IT.
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS

34:06.995 --> 34:09.146
TO ANY OF THESE OBJECTS
AT ANY POINT TONIGHT,

34:09.181 --> 34:11.482
THAT THING'S GONNA
MAKE A SOUND.

34:11.516 --> 34:13.748
AND WE ARE
GOING TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

34:13.784 --> 34:16.920
THIS IS ADAM, MEGHAN, AND AMY
IN THE LIVING ROOM.

34:19.590 --> 34:21.659
WE'VE BEEN HERE
THE LAST FEW NIGHTS

34:21.694 --> 34:23.878
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

34:23.913 --> 34:26.063
WHO IS HERE AND WHAT
THEY WANT AND --

34:26.098 --> 34:27.896
AND WHAT
THEY'RE TRYING TO SAY.

34:27.931 --> 34:30.833
SO IF THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU'D LIKE TO SAY,

34:30.869 --> 34:33.737
ESPECIALLY TO MEGHAN,
YOU CAN SAY IT NOW.

34:38.175 --> 34:40.445
DO YOU LIKE MEGHAN?

34:45.983 --> 34:49.152
DO YOU VISIT OTHER
FAMILY MEMBERS?

34:57.428 --> 34:59.595
NANA, IF -- IF THAT IS YOU,

34:59.630 --> 35:03.101
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHO IS HERE WITH US.

35:10.174 --> 35:10.908
THE EMF JUST WENT OFF.

35:10.943 --> 35:11.642
THE EMF JUST WENT OFF.

35:19.550 --> 35:22.920
IF THAT'S YOU, CAN YOU GRAB ON
TO THAT LITTLE BOX THERE?

35:27.491 --> 35:30.259
YOU CAN TOUCH IT.

35:30.294 --> 35:34.631
IT'S JUST GONNA SHOW MEGHAN THAT
YOU'RE REALLY HERE WITH US

35:34.666 --> 35:36.834
IF YOU CAN COMMUNICATE
WITH US THROUGH THAT BOX.

35:49.446 --> 35:51.913
NANA,
IF -- IF THAT IS YOU,

35:51.948 --> 35:57.054
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHO IS HERE WITH US.

35:57.089 --> 35:58.156
THE EMF JUST WENT OFF.

35:58.191 --> 35:59.223
THE EMF JUST WENT OFF.

36:03.461 --> 36:06.997
IF THAT'S YOU, CAN YOU GRAB ON
TO THAT LITTLE BOX THERE?

36:09.633 --> 36:12.136
YOU CAN TOUCH IT.

36:17.808 --> 36:21.512
THAT IS PRETTY WILD.

36:25.983 --> 36:28.119
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU WANNA SAY?

36:33.324 --> 36:35.175
HAVE YOU HAD ANY
OTHER BIG THINGS

36:35.210 --> 36:37.027
GOING ON LATELY
IN YOUR LIFE?

36:37.062 --> 36:40.696
WELL, LAST MONTH,

36:40.731 --> 36:43.932
I WAS IN THE AREA
WHERE NANA'S BURIED.

36:43.967 --> 36:48.272
AND HER GRAVESTONE WAS
VERY COVERED WITH MOSS.

36:49.807 --> 36:53.977
SO I WENT HOME
AND GRABBED A SCRUB BRUSH

36:53.978 --> 36:56.213
AND WENT BACK
AND CLEANED HER GRAVESTONE.

36:56.248 --> 36:57.212
AWW.

36:57.247 --> 36:59.081
AND DAD AND I WERE JOKING

36:59.116 --> 37:03.988
THAT NANA WOULD
REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.

37:04.023 --> 37:05.454
AND MY AUNT JOKED,

37:05.489 --> 37:10.160
SAYING THAT SHE WAS PROBABLY MAD
THAT SHE DIDN'T DO IT.

37:10.195 --> 37:12.562
WE ARE GETTING
EMF READINGS.

37:16.933 --> 37:20.303
SO AS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT,
THE EMF AND THE --

37:20.338 --> 37:22.505
IS GOING OFF.

37:22.540 --> 37:25.626
SHE DEFINITELY
CHECKS IN ON YOU.

37:25.661 --> 37:28.712
HOW DOES THAT
MAKE YOU FEEL?

37:30.815 --> 37:32.949
HAPPY.
A LITTLE EMOTIONAL.

37:32.984 --> 37:35.286
I KNOW. ME TOO.

37:39.389 --> 37:43.661
NOW, I MEAN, YOU HOLD
THESE POSSESSIONS VERY DEAR.

37:43.696 --> 37:47.497
YOU'RE KEEPING
HER MEMORY ALIVE.

37:47.532 --> 37:50.733
I LOVE THESE THINGS.

37:50.768 --> 37:53.137
SOME OF THE STUFF, EVEN THOUGH
WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN,

37:53.172 --> 37:54.803
LIKE, UGLY, WE STILL --

37:54.838 --> 37:57.775
WE STILL KEPT THEM BECAUSE
WE KNEW IT MEANT A LOT TO HER.

37:59.043 --> 38:01.812
I THINK WHAT HAD HAPPENED HERE
IS PRETTY TELLING,

38:01.847 --> 38:03.681
I WOULD SAY.

38:12.122 --> 38:14.424
ALL RIGHT.

38:15.744 --> 38:16.925
RIGHT?

38:16.960 --> 38:19.961
I MEAN, WHAT?

38:19.996 --> 38:21.830
I -- I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

38:21.865 --> 38:24.600
I'M HONESTLY A LITTLE SPEECHLESS
ABOUT THE ENTIRE THING.

38:24.601 --> 38:26.368
IT ALL KIND OF JUST
CAME TOGETHER.

38:26.403 --> 38:29.305
AND I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER
FOR MEGHAN RIGHT NOW.

38:29.306 --> 38:31.508
OBVIOUSLY, WE ALL VISIT
THE GRAVES OF OUR LOVED ONES.

38:31.543 --> 38:32.808
BUT GOING
AND CLEANING IT --

38:32.809 --> 38:34.912
AND THEN WE WERE GETTING
THE ACTIVITY AROUND THAT.

38:34.947 --> 38:36.645
AND THEN WE GOT THE ACTIVITY
AROUND THAT.

38:36.680 --> 38:39.182
SPECIFICALLY AROUND THE ACT
OF HER CLEANING THE GRAVESTONE.

38:39.217 --> 38:40.750
AND THEN
THE ACTIVITY HAPPENS.

38:40.785 --> 38:42.550
AND THE EMF GOES OFF.

38:42.585 --> 38:43.719
AND IT WAS -- IT'S JUST --

38:43.754 --> 38:45.854
IT WAS HER NANA
JUST TELLING HER, LIKE,

38:45.889 --> 38:48.625
"I KNEW YOU DID THAT.
I KNOW YOU DID THAT. THANK YOU.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.461
AND I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING
AND I SEE YOU

38:50.496 --> 38:52.361
AND, YES, THIS IS ME."

38:52.362 --> 38:55.566
AND I JUST -- I DON'T SEE
ANYTHING THAT MAKES ME FEEL

38:55.601 --> 38:57.685
LIKE THE PREVIOUS
HOMEOWNER IS HERE.

38:57.720 --> 38:59.770
I THINK THE MALE VOICE
WE GOT...

39:03.473 --> 39:05.976
...COULD BE RELATED TO
THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD.

39:06.011 --> 39:09.144
IT SAID "NO" WHEN
WE ASKED IT TO TALK.

39:09.179 --> 39:11.715
IT MOVED OUR CAMERA. AND SO
IT DOESN'T WANT TO BE FILMED.

39:11.750 --> 39:14.116
THERE'S NO WAY.
THERE'S NO WAY.

39:14.151 --> 39:16.069
BUT I DON'T THINK
IT'S ANYTHING BAD.

39:16.104 --> 39:17.953
I THINK IT JUST WANTS
TO BE LEFT ALONE.

39:17.988 --> 39:21.924
MOST OF THE ACTIVITY WAS TRYING
TO GET MEGHAN'S ATTENTION.

39:21.925 --> 39:25.479
WHEN SHE MOVED IN,
IT SAID...

39:25.514 --> 39:28.998
- IT ACTUALLY CALLED OUT
HER NAME. -!

39:29.033 --> 39:30.299
YOU HEAR THAT?

39:30.300 --> 39:32.852
AND AFTER TONIGHT,
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE SHE WANTED

39:32.887 --> 39:35.314
TO LET MEGHAN KNOW
THAT SHE'S HERE WITH HER.

39:35.349 --> 39:37.741
IF -- IF NANA WASN'T
COMMUNICATING WITH HER,

39:37.776 --> 39:40.194
THE MOMENT WOULD HAVE
NEVER HAPPENED.

39:40.229 --> 39:42.613
EXACTLY. I LIKE IT.
I THINK WE DID GOOD.

39:42.648 --> 39:43.848
GREAT.

39:52.122 --> 39:54.089
MEGHAN, THANK YOU
FOR JOINING US TODAY.

39:54.124 --> 39:56.993
AND, SHORTLY, YOU WILL HAVE
YOUR HOUSE BACK. I PROMISE.

39:56.994 --> 39:58.494
I KNOW.
ARE YOU TIRED OF US YET?

39:58.529 --> 40:00.431
WE'RE PRETTY MUCH
MOVED IN AT THIS POINT.

40:00.466 --> 40:02.431
WHAT WE WANNA START WITH --

40:02.466 --> 40:04.701
I DID A LOT OF RESEARCH
ON THE HOUSE.

40:04.736 --> 40:06.520
AND I TALKED TO
A LOCAL HISTORIAN.

40:06.555 --> 40:09.165
IT'S OUR BELIEF
THAT YOUR HOUSE

40:09.200 --> 40:11.889
IS ACTUALLY MUCH OLDER
THAN 1890.

40:11.924 --> 40:14.543
WE DO THINK YOUR HOUSE
DOES MATCH UP

40:14.578 --> 40:18.981
WITH THE TIME PERIOD
FOR THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD.

40:19.016 --> 40:22.118
WE DO THINK THERE'S SOME SORT
OF ENTITY THAT IS NOT RELATED

40:22.153 --> 40:23.785
TO WHAT'S GOING ON
IN THE REST OF THE HOUSE.

40:23.820 --> 40:25.956
AND IT -- IT MIGHT COME OUT
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

40:25.991 --> 40:27.757
I MEAN, IF THIS GUY
IS LIVING DOWN THERE,

40:27.792 --> 40:29.558
MAYBE CLEAN UP
THAT CRAWLSPACE.

40:29.593 --> 40:31.761
MAKE IT A LITTLE
MORE LIVABLE FOR HIM.

40:31.796 --> 40:33.195
I MEAN,
FROM OUR EXPERIENCES,

40:33.230 --> 40:35.198
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT HIM AT ALL.

40:35.233 --> 40:36.966
WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN ANYTHING

40:36.967 --> 40:38.834
ON THE PREVIOUS
HOMEOWNER IN HERE.

40:38.869 --> 40:41.804
BUT WE DID A LOT
OF EVP WORK LAST NIGHT

40:41.839 --> 40:43.974
WHEN WE WERE INVESTIGATING
WHEN YOU WERE WITH US.

40:44.009 --> 40:45.476
AND WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT THE THINGS

40:45.511 --> 40:46.510
THAT YOUR GRANDMOTHER MADE.

40:51.481 --> 40:54.084
- YEAH. RIGHT? "I MADE THEM."
- YEAH.

40:58.956 --> 41:01.241
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE KEPT
SAYING THEY WERE UGLY.

41:01.276 --> 41:03.527
AND THEN YOU HEAR THIS
VOICE SAY, "I MADE THEM."

41:03.562 --> 41:05.527
"I MADE THEM."

41:05.562 --> 41:07.262
SHE'S HERE,
WATCHING OVER YOU.

41:07.297 --> 41:09.232
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY
TO YOUR DAD?

41:09.267 --> 41:12.067
LIKE, I THINK

41:12.068 --> 41:16.206
HE'S GONNA BE THRILLED
THAT HIS MOM'S HERE.

41:16.241 --> 41:18.008
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

41:20.343 --> 41:22.511
WELL, SEE? I'M GLAD
WE COULD HELP EVERYBODY.

41:22.512 --> 41:24.948
YEAH. I'M, LIKE, I WANNA
HUG HER SO BAD RIGHT NOW.

41:24.983 --> 41:26.315
THANK YOU, GUYS,
SO MUCH.

41:26.350 --> 41:28.586
I'M GONNA GET
ON THE SIDE HERE.

41:32.490 --> 41:34.390
NOW THAT MEGHAN
HAS SOME ANSWERS,

41:34.391 --> 41:37.995
SHE CAN FINALLY START TO FEEL
COMFORTABLE IN HER OWN HOME.

41:38.030 --> 41:39.962
NANA ISN'T HERE TO BE MALICIOUS.

41:39.963 --> 41:41.664
SHE JUST WANTS MEGHAN
TO KNOW SHE'S HERE

41:41.699 --> 41:43.800
AND WATCHING OVER HER.

41:43.835 --> 41:45.867
YEAH. THAT'S THEIRS.

41:45.902 --> 41:48.803
SO ALL THIS
IS THEIRS, TOO?

41:48.838 --> 41:51.809
EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T FEEL LIKE
THE PREVIOUS HOMEOWNER IS HERE,

41:51.844 --> 41:53.843
WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT
FOR MEGHAN TO GIVE BACK

41:53.878 --> 41:56.312
WHAT WAS LEFT TO HER KIDS.

41:56.313 --> 41:58.081
- GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
- IT WAS NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

41:58.116 --> 41:59.984
THANKS FOR COMING BACK.

42:00.019 --> 42:01.817
MEGHAN CAN FINALLY LET GO.

42:01.852 --> 42:03.570
AND THE FAMILY CAN
CHERISH THOSE ITEMS

42:03.605 --> 42:05.288
AND REMEMBER
THEIR LOST LOVED ONE.

42:05.289 --> 42:07.157
IT'S WONDERFUL THAT WE CAN
GIVE THEM BACK TO YOU, YOU KNOW.

42:07.192 --> 42:08.625
IT'S NOT A LOT OF STUFF.
BUT IT'S, STUFF

42:08.660 --> 42:10.759
THAT MEGHAN REALLY
WANTED YOU TO HAVE.

42:10.794 --> 42:12.327
I HAVE A LOT OF KNICKKNACKS
FROM MY FAMILY.

42:12.362 --> 42:15.599
SO I KNOW THAT, LIKE, TO ME,
THESE WOULD BE IMPORTANT.

42:15.634 --> 42:18.836
I WOULDN'T FEEL RIGHT, LIKE,
JUST THROWING 'EM OUT.

42:18.871 --> 42:21.270
THANK YOU.

42:21.305 --> 42:24.441
LET'S LOAD THIS UP. AND
THERE'S SOME MORE INSIDE, TOO.

42:24.476 --> 42:28.645
THANK YOU FOR
TAKING CARE OF THEM.
