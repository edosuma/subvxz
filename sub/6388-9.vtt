00:02.546 --> 00:04.046
You know, the weird thing is,

00:04.081 --> 00:05.915
my husband's dead,
and I'm numb.

00:05.950 --> 00:08.016
How the fuck you doing, Moody?

00:08.052 --> 00:09.647
My dick don't work no more.
A man can only shoot

00:09.767 --> 00:10.967
so many loads in a lifetime.

00:11.002 --> 00:12.903
I mean, literally,
you can run out.

00:12.937 --> 00:15.105
We need one pound
of your best Peruvian blend.

00:15.139 --> 00:17.374
- We will be on our way.
- I like that suit.

00:17.408 --> 00:19.242
- Take it off.
- What about your old lady?

00:19.277 --> 00:20.968
- What about her?
- What about her needs?

00:21.088 --> 00:22.212
Wives are different.

00:22.246 --> 00:24.681
They don't rub themselves raw
like we do.

00:24.715 --> 00:26.475
I know my husband fucks around
on the road,

00:26.484 --> 00:27.751
but we have an agreement.

00:27.785 --> 00:29.352
I've been wanting
to talk to you.

00:29.387 --> 00:31.922
- Regarding?
- An extramarital affair.

00:31.956 --> 00:33.623
- Oh, my.
- I'm still in love

00:33.658 --> 00:35.625
- with her, Stu.
- Me too.

00:35.660 --> 00:37.928
But I will pay you
to not pursue Marcy any longer.

00:37.962 --> 00:40.797
This is a fucking disaster.

00:40.832 --> 00:42.466
What the fuck
are you guys talking about?

00:42.500 --> 00:45.769
It's a rock opera
with the tone of my book.

00:45.803 --> 00:47.003
It's bollocks.

00:47.038 --> 00:48.472
It doesn't have any heart,

00:48.506 --> 00:51.335
and you have a huge heart.

00:51.455 --> 00:53.310
Oh, I just had me

00:53.344 --> 00:56.540
an assgasm.
Oh.

Good morning, sunshine.

Your work is delightful.

01:14.465 --> 01:16.333
Great job on the rewrite, Hank.

01:16.367 --> 01:18.735
It really puts a smile
on the face.

01:18.769 --> 01:20.737
I love a good musical.

01:20.771 --> 01:22.138
Warms the fucking cockles.

01:22.173 --> 01:23.773
What the fuck
are you doing here?

01:23.808 --> 01:25.041
The missus caught me

01:25.076 --> 01:26.376
eating one
of her chocolate bars

01:26.410 --> 01:28.345
out of the cleaning lady's
vagina.

01:31.015 --> 01:32.282
That's disgusting.

01:32.350 --> 01:33.517
No, it was delicious.

01:33.551 --> 01:35.619
It was Marilyn Manson's idea.

01:35.653 --> 01:37.721
Once upon a time,
according to rock legend,

01:37.755 --> 01:39.623
mind you,
Mick Jagger was caught

01:39.657 --> 01:41.291
eating a chocolate bar

01:41.325 --> 01:44.628
out of Marianne Faithfull's
warm, gooey center.

01:44.662 --> 01:46.196
Bowie was there too.

01:46.230 --> 01:48.031
Of course now they all swear
it never happened.

01:48.065 --> 01:50.634
But I felt like I should try it
at least once.

01:50.668 --> 01:52.903
I'm actually surprised
it's taken me this long.

01:52.937 --> 01:54.538
By the by, Atticus,

01:54.572 --> 01:57.874
just any idea
how long you might be staying?

01:57.909 --> 01:59.476
I hadn't really thought
about it.

01:59.510 --> 02:00.544
It could be quite a while,
though.

02:00.578 --> 02:02.012
She was fucking furious.

02:02.046 --> 02:04.748
Almost cut my dick off.

02:04.782 --> 02:06.650
Is this gonna be a problem,
Runkle?

02:06.684 --> 02:07.751
No.

02:07.785 --> 02:09.219
I just--
you know, I thought

02:09.252 --> 02:10.654
you might be more comfortable
at a hotel.

02:10.687 --> 02:12.322
Why would I be more comfortable

02:12.356 --> 02:13.590
paying for posh lodgings

02:13.624 --> 02:16.493
when I can stay
with my manager?

02:16.527 --> 02:17.494
For free.

02:17.528 --> 02:19.262
Makes sense to me.

02:19.297 --> 02:21.398
Tell me, will... Krull

02:21.432 --> 02:22.732
be staying too?

02:22.767 --> 02:23.733
Of course.

02:23.768 --> 02:25.001
He's my road manager.

02:25.036 --> 02:26.202
Anytime I leave my house,

02:26.237 --> 02:27.737
I'm technically on the road.

02:27.772 --> 02:29.439
Krull gets me from point "A"
to point "B"

02:29.473 --> 02:31.841
and knows where to find all
my favorite creature comforts

02:31.876 --> 02:33.243
along the way.

02:33.277 --> 02:35.812
Where's the shitter
in this place?

02:35.846 --> 02:39.082
Ooh.

02:39.116 --> 02:40.951
Yeah, go easy, big fella.

02:40.985 --> 02:42.552
- Low-flow toilets.
- Hey.

02:42.587 --> 02:45.322
- We should have a party.
- Why?

02:45.356 --> 02:46.890
I'm newly single.

02:46.924 --> 02:48.224
You've just had
a major creative breakthrough.

02:48.259 --> 02:49.859
We should fucking celebrate.

02:49.894 --> 02:53.129
One should mark
such fucking milestones.

02:53.164 --> 02:55.465
You know, that's not really
a bad idea, Hank.

02:55.499 --> 02:57.000
The last big party I had here

02:57.034 --> 02:58.602
was filled
with smelly leather boys.

02:58.636 --> 03:00.637
Couldn't really wash the stink
off the joint.

03:00.671 --> 03:02.305
Okay, well, where's the master?

03:02.340 --> 03:03.640
I'm gonna rest up
for tonight's shindig.

03:03.674 --> 03:05.308
Follow the Krull.

03:05.343 --> 03:07.077
Oh, and, Runkle,
can you get a piano delivered?

03:07.111 --> 03:09.479
And make sure there's heaps
of alcohol and cocaine

03:09.513 --> 03:11.114
and Mars bars and Astroglide.

03:11.148 --> 03:12.582
Brilliant work, Hank.

03:12.617 --> 03:14.551
I'm gonna go put this
under my pillow

03:14.585 --> 03:16.653
and do some dream-writing.

03:16.687 --> 03:20.490
But first I must masturbate
myself to sleep.

No, no.

No!

05:06.063 --> 05:08.531
Hey, pussy fart, how you doing?

05:08.566 --> 05:10.133
Eh, all right, Eddie.

05:10.167 --> 05:12.936
- How about yourself?
- I heard you came out recently.

05:12.970 --> 05:14.437
For a short time, yes.

05:14.472 --> 05:15.672
He almost took
a man in his mouth.

05:15.706 --> 05:17.140
I took a man in my mouth once.

05:17.174 --> 05:18.775
Yes, we know, Eddie.

05:18.809 --> 05:20.376
I engineered that orgasm.

05:20.411 --> 05:24.981
My hands, mouth, feet.

05:30.888 --> 05:35.058
I watched his jism
form a slimy St. Louis Arch

05:35.092 --> 05:36.693
in the air
before landing comfortably

05:36.727 --> 05:39.596
on the rug
in the Lincoln bedroom.

05:39.630 --> 05:41.197
You performed fellatio
in the White House?

05:41.232 --> 05:42.398
Shh, it's not appropriate,
but yes.

05:42.433 --> 05:43.566
I had an experience

05:43.601 --> 05:45.135
with a gent once.

05:45.169 --> 05:46.136
He was quite pretty.

05:46.170 --> 05:48.371
Showed up in the backstage area.

05:48.405 --> 05:51.775
Fooled the road crew.
Sure as hell fooled me.

05:51.809 --> 05:53.777
He gave a lovely blow job.

05:53.811 --> 05:55.745
I reached into his knickers,

05:55.780 --> 05:57.447
felt what I initially thought
to be

05:57.481 --> 05:59.649
a slightly oversized
female clitoris,

05:59.683 --> 06:03.720
but, no, it was a gentleman's
short, but quite broad penis.

06:03.754 --> 06:05.388
I thought to myself,

06:05.422 --> 06:07.590
"What would Bowie do?"

06:07.625 --> 06:10.760
And then I gave up and got
security to beat him senseless.

06:10.795 --> 06:12.729
And then I felt sorry for him

06:12.763 --> 06:14.230
and let him blow me again.

06:14.265 --> 06:15.826
Holes is holes
when all's said and done.

06:15.833 --> 06:18.268
That's exactly
what I always say.

06:18.302 --> 06:21.337
I have big news.

06:21.372 --> 06:24.040
Tonight I'm gonna make love
to a woman.

06:24.074 --> 06:26.309
Oh, well, maybe we should
alert the media.

06:26.343 --> 06:28.578
<i>Entertainment Tonight</i>
or maybe <i>National Geographic.</i>

06:28.612 --> 06:32.015
Well, I have been celibate
for quite some time now.

06:32.049 --> 06:34.184
I thought that I'd lost
all my loads.

06:34.218 --> 06:36.586
But they came back,
and if I'm going to star

06:36.620 --> 06:38.461
in a traditional love story,
I need to remember

06:38.489 --> 06:39.989
what it's like to come again
with a woman.

06:40.024 --> 06:41.591
And, by the way,
what's the deal

06:41.625 --> 06:43.092
with this party?

06:43.127 --> 06:44.694
'Cause seems
like it's a little bit

06:44.728 --> 06:46.129
of a sausage fest.

06:46.163 --> 06:47.630
Yeah, Runkle.
Where are the girls?

06:47.665 --> 06:49.699
I'm sorry.
What do you mean?

06:49.733 --> 06:51.601
I said we should have a party.

06:51.635 --> 06:52.969
Did you expect me to send out
the fucking invites,

06:53.003 --> 06:54.170
you senseless wanker?

06:54.205 --> 06:55.772
And what about the drugs?

06:55.806 --> 06:57.807
- Where are the drugs?
- Okay.

06:57.842 --> 07:00.643
Atticus, well, we had good luck
with the chocolate bars

07:00.678 --> 07:02.612
and the Astroglide,
but there was

07:02.646 --> 07:04.247
a little bit of a problem
with the drugs.

07:07.418 --> 07:10.486
Fuckin' fuck, Runkle.

07:10.521 --> 07:12.655
Jesus.
Aah!

07:12.690 --> 07:13.690
Was that a banana?

07:13.724 --> 07:14.958
I want drugs.

07:14.992 --> 07:16.826
I want some fucking girls

07:16.861 --> 07:19.229
and some fucking drugs.

07:19.263 --> 07:21.531
Drugs.

07:21.565 --> 07:23.833
- Whoo!
- Hey.

07:25.402 --> 07:26.536
Hi.

07:26.570 --> 07:28.671
- Hank Moody.
- Boom.

07:28.706 --> 07:30.807
Hey.
How's my suit?

07:30.841 --> 07:33.776
- It's aspirational.
- Ah.

07:33.811 --> 07:35.211
Gonna fit in that fucker
one day.

07:35.246 --> 07:37.380
Excellent, exce--
good luck with that.

07:37.414 --> 07:39.782
You know, you don't have
to be so fucking snarky.

07:39.817 --> 07:42.085
Slow and steady wins the race,
asshole.

07:42.119 --> 07:44.020
I'll fit in that suit before
you grow your fucking hair back.

07:44.054 --> 07:46.522
Boom!

07:48.225 --> 07:50.927
- Frank.
- Widow.

07:50.961 --> 07:55.531

warlock who turned me bum

07:59.737 --> 08:02.839
into the happiest place
on earth.

08:02.873 --> 08:04.374
I've missed you,

08:04.408 --> 08:06.409

- I've been well.

08:09.313 --> 08:10.780
- I've been well, you know.
- Good.

08:10.814 --> 08:12.315
Thinking about finding me
a new husband.

08:12.349 --> 08:13.950
Oh, really?

08:13.984 --> 08:15.424
Tony left me
in financial shambles.

08:15.452 --> 08:17.654
You know.
I mean, we spent it

08:17.688 --> 08:19.255
as fast as he made it.

08:19.290 --> 08:20.957
I don't know
if he's marriage material,

08:20.991 --> 08:22.225
but Eddie Nero right over here

08:22.259 --> 08:24.928
is looking to bust
a big, fat load

08:24.962 --> 08:26.396
after being celibate
for quite some time.

08:26.430 --> 08:27.830
- Really?
- Maybe you two could help

08:27.865 --> 08:29.265
- each other out.
- Oh, no.

08:29.300 --> 08:30.800
He's a little too pretty
for me.

08:30.834 --> 08:32.969
And he poops on people.

08:33.003 --> 08:35.871
Blue eyes poops on people.
You're into the scat-play, huh?

08:35.905 --> 08:37.440

08:43.080 --> 08:44.747

Speaking of dirty,

08:46.016 --> 08:47.450
what do you say, Popeye?

08:47.484 --> 08:48.718
You ready to bust one
out of the chamber,

08:48.752 --> 08:50.553
so we can sit back, relax,

09:08.672 --> 09:10.506
Stop.

09:10.541 --> 09:11.975
I'm almost done.

09:12.009 --> 09:14.310
Fuck.

09:14.345 --> 09:16.012
This is good, Hank.

09:16.046 --> 09:17.780
Almost makes me want
to jump your bones.

09:17.815 --> 09:18.982
Almost?
What else--

09:19.016 --> 09:21.050
I got a typewriter right here.

09:21.085 --> 09:23.152
Damn.

09:23.187 --> 09:24.287
Thank you.

09:24.321 --> 09:25.321
Well, your thoughts,

09:25.356 --> 09:28.458
and the kind, thoughtful,

09:28.492 --> 09:29.759
long-legged manner

09:29.793 --> 09:31.427
in which you chose
to express them,

09:31.462 --> 09:34.197
had much to do
with the end result.

09:34.231 --> 09:37.633
Well, it leaves you
with the same feeling

09:37.668 --> 09:40.536
that a real great song does.

09:40.571 --> 09:45.475
Sadly, I think
my work here is done.

09:45.509 --> 09:47.377
What?
No more sexy time?

09:47.444 --> 09:48.644
Say it ain't so.

09:48.679 --> 09:51.180
Well, too much
leads to too much.

09:51.215 --> 09:53.116
Sooner or later,
someone gets hurt.

09:53.150 --> 09:54.217
Yeah, well, you're right.

09:54.251 --> 09:55.351
You should probably do your best

09:55.386 --> 09:56.652
not to fall in love with me.

09:56.687 --> 09:58.221
I wasn't worried about me.

09:58.255 --> 09:59.956
No, no, be careful.

09:59.990 --> 10:01.791
I have a tendency
to take root in the hearts

10:01.825 --> 10:04.127
and minds of those who initially
find me off-putting.

10:04.161 --> 10:06.629
It's a small, but loyal group.

10:06.663 --> 10:10.633
Well, everything put together

10:10.667 --> 10:12.201
falls apart, Hank.

10:12.236 --> 10:14.170
- Paul Simon.
- Very good.

10:14.204 --> 10:15.872
No, that was easy for me.
Know why?

10:15.906 --> 10:17.206
- Why?
- 'Cause I'm old as dirt.

10:17.241 --> 10:18.674
Oh.

10:18.709 --> 10:22.178
Oh, come here.

10:22.212 --> 10:24.680
- You're not so old.
- Oh, sweet talker.

10:32.256 --> 10:34.490
Oh, my back.

10:34.525 --> 10:35.892
My back.
Oh, jeez.

10:41.331 --> 10:45.268
I've never been sodomized
in a child's nursery before.

10:45.302 --> 10:47.236
- What fun.
- That's odd.

10:47.271 --> 10:49.739
Oh, hey, you two.

10:49.773 --> 10:52.508
Hey.
Oh, this is Trudy.

10:52.543 --> 10:54.210
This is Marcy and Karen.

10:54.244 --> 10:57.580
This is Trudy,
and Trudy was recently widowed.

10:57.614 --> 10:59.649
It's true.
I was.

10:59.683 --> 11:02.218
- Yeah, my hubby O.D.'d.
- Oh, sorry.

11:02.252 --> 11:04.587
But Jean-Luc Picard here
has been keeping me company.

11:04.621 --> 11:06.856
- Jean-Luc Picard.
- Right?

11:06.890 --> 11:08.791
He's not too big
in the lap, you see,

11:08.826 --> 11:11.060
but he's enthusiastic,
if you know what I'm saying.

11:11.095 --> 11:13.396
Yeah, I know
what you're saying.

11:13.430 --> 11:16.032
Hey. I thought you said
they weren't coming.

11:16.066 --> 11:17.567
They said they weren't coming.

11:17.601 --> 11:18.801
Here they are.

11:18.836 --> 11:20.036
- Good.
- Yeah.

11:20.070 --> 11:21.637
We got bored, we smoked weed,

11:21.672 --> 11:25.541
and we wanted to meet
Atticus Fetch, yeah!

11:25.576 --> 11:27.143
You should.
You should.

11:27.177 --> 11:29.412
You should have sex with him.
Both of you.

11:29.446 --> 11:31.047
He's single now,

11:31.081 --> 11:32.415
and he's quite good
in the sack, you know.

11:32.449 --> 11:33.850
A little lazy when it comes

11:33.884 --> 11:36.619
to the oral return favors
and such.

11:36.653 --> 11:39.222
- Unlike the ass whisperer here.
- That's me!

11:39.256 --> 11:41.457
He gives as good
as he gets, he does.

11:41.492 --> 11:43.793
Oh, that's not exactly
my experience.

11:43.827 --> 11:45.261
Hey.

11:45.295 --> 11:47.597
Have you ever done Atticus
before?

11:47.631 --> 11:48.965
Uh, no, I have not had
the pleasure.

11:48.999 --> 11:50.433
We should do him together.

11:50.467 --> 11:53.102
We could.
Or we could go get a drink

11:53.137 --> 11:54.070
right--right now.

11:54.104 --> 11:55.638
Whatever you think, love.

11:55.672 --> 11:57.106
Marcy, let me introduce you
to Atticus.

11:57.141 --> 11:58.641
No.
Allow me.

11:58.675 --> 12:01.410
Okay. Whichever one.
Lead the way.

12:01.445 --> 12:04.580
I see you have a new friend.

12:04.615 --> 12:06.983
Yes, and she's--and that's
what she is, a friend.

12:07.017 --> 12:08.317
She's a lovely young woman

12:08.352 --> 12:10.019
who has helped guide me
creatively.

12:10.053 --> 12:11.787
Right.
I'm sure.

12:11.822 --> 12:14.690
Sort of a Florence Nightingale
in your time of need...

12:14.725 --> 12:16.092
- Oh.
- Kind of thing.

12:16.126 --> 12:17.660
Well, you know what,
I'm happy to see

12:17.694 --> 12:19.362
that I can still get
a jealous rise out of you.

12:19.396 --> 12:20.863
But you just say the word,

12:20.898 --> 12:23.966
and I will stop the world
and melt with you.

12:24.001 --> 12:25.234
Yeah, I said that.

12:25.269 --> 12:28.037
Oh.

12:28.071 --> 12:30.206
- You remember Eddie. Karen.
- Hi, hey.

12:30.240 --> 12:32.074
Karen, you remember Yusuf Nero?

12:32.109 --> 12:33.976
Of course.
The last time we were together,

12:34.011 --> 12:36.679
you were seeing that handsome
African-American fellow.

12:36.713 --> 12:39.182
No, that was just a phase,
like you pooping on people.

12:39.216 --> 12:41.450
I had a feeling
that was a passing thing.

12:41.485 --> 12:44.120
A milk chocolate
mandingo fantasy.

12:44.154 --> 12:45.988
Perfectly normal.
You're entitled.

12:46.023 --> 12:48.224
Particularly after the hell that
this lunatic's put you through.

12:48.258 --> 12:50.026
Oh, okay, well,
speaking of lunatics,

12:50.060 --> 12:53.362
you know, Karen was recently
married to a pansexual loon

12:53.397 --> 12:55.231
named Richard Bates,
the writer.

12:55.265 --> 12:57.366
- You know him?
- Are you kidding me?

12:57.401 --> 13:00.836
He's the man I took
in my mouth.

13:00.871 --> 13:03.339
- Of course he is.
- Richard Bates.

13:03.373 --> 13:05.875
He wrote the definitive draft
of <i>John,</i>

13:05.909 --> 13:08.344
the Michael Mann movie
that won me the Academy Award

13:08.378 --> 13:11.581
for Best Actor,
but it's not about the kudos.

13:11.615 --> 13:13.149
- It's about the work.
- Of course not.

13:13.183 --> 13:14.850
- Karen.
- Mm-hmm.

13:14.885 --> 13:16.219
It has been many years
since we've seen each other,

13:16.253 --> 13:17.493
and yet you have not aged
a day.

13:17.521 --> 13:21.023
Your stems, your hindquarters

13:21.058 --> 13:22.658
remain glorious.

13:22.693 --> 13:24.427
Your skin is flawless.

13:24.461 --> 13:26.495
You are a beautiful woman.

13:26.530 --> 13:28.164
Well, thank you, Eddie.

13:28.198 --> 13:29.699
- You will do perfectly.
- Whoa, whoa.

13:29.733 --> 13:32.235
- Watch it, Nero.
- Eddie needs my help.

13:32.269 --> 13:35.404
Your effluvium
is delightful, a rare vintage.

13:35.439 --> 13:37.306
Come, allow me to seduce you.

13:37.341 --> 13:38.708
Now fuck off.
Go away.

13:38.742 --> 13:40.343
Well, we tried.

13:40.377 --> 13:43.613
Krull. Sorry.

13:43.647 --> 13:45.348
The one thing I know
about Atticus

13:45.382 --> 13:47.750
is he loves his fans,
and we've got

13:47.784 --> 13:49.852
a great, big one right here
who would very much like to say,

13:49.886 --> 13:50.953
"Hello."

13:50.988 --> 13:52.054
And what's this big fan

13:52.089 --> 13:53.222
gonna do with me?

13:53.257 --> 13:54.724
Hey, you.

13:54.758 --> 13:56.525
I'm somebody's mother.

13:56.560 --> 13:57.881
Yeah, but you're not mine,
love.

13:57.894 --> 13:58.894
How about a bit of suction?

14:01.064 --> 14:05.935
Allow me to handle this.

14:05.969 --> 14:09.071
Hmm.

14:09.106 --> 14:11.240
Allow me to handle this.

14:14.278 --> 14:16.512
♪

14:23.220 --> 14:25.221
Well, it looks
like we found the party.

14:25.255 --> 14:27.657
- Hello, girls.
- Who is this?

14:27.691 --> 14:29.458
Oh, please, Atticus,
let me introduce you

14:29.493 --> 14:31.627
- to my ex-wife.
- And mine.

14:31.662 --> 14:33.429
And the mother of my child.

14:33.463 --> 14:35.231
You were both married
to this woman?

14:35.265 --> 14:36.666
Yes.
Yes, we were.

14:36.700 --> 14:38.768
What the fuck's wrong with you?

14:38.802 --> 14:41.470
How much time do you have?

14:41.505 --> 14:43.306
Marcy.
Huge fan.

14:43.340 --> 14:45.107
Finally.
A fan.

14:45.142 --> 14:47.510
She loves the musicians.

14:47.544 --> 14:49.445
She had quite a serious fling
with Rick Springfield

14:49.479 --> 14:51.180
- once upon a time.
- Really?

14:51.214 --> 14:53.249
You were one of Jesse's girls,
were you?

14:53.283 --> 14:54.417
Yes.
Yes, she was.

14:54.451 --> 14:55.918
She even had the ringtone

14:55.952 --> 14:57.019
to prove it.

14:57.054 --> 14:58.321
Why is it you never mentioned

14:58.355 --> 15:00.122
a fling
with a major fucking pop star?

15:00.157 --> 15:01.957
I don't know, Stu.

15:01.992 --> 15:04.727
Maybe it's because you're
so fucking jealous.

15:04.761 --> 15:07.129
Maybe it's because you need
to be the only cock in town.

15:07.164 --> 15:10.633
Maybe it's because I fucking
love you so much, Marcy.

15:10.667 --> 15:12.435
- That is why.
- Okay, well, it looks

15:12.469 --> 15:13.636
like this meet and greet
is over.

15:13.670 --> 15:16.305
- Let's go, Marcy.
- Yes. Leave her

15:16.340 --> 15:17.640
- with me.
- Oh, that's probably

15:17.674 --> 15:18.808
not a good idea.

15:18.842 --> 15:19.963
Yeah, we're happy to stay.

15:19.976 --> 15:21.310
You're not actually my type.

15:21.345 --> 15:26.148
I usually go
for tall, leggy blondes.

15:26.183 --> 15:28.250
But you're quite sexual,
aren't you?

15:28.285 --> 15:30.419
She's incredibly sexual.

15:30.454 --> 15:32.388
Built for speed, born to fuck.

15:32.422 --> 15:35.024
Sinking into this woman
is like swimming in a vat

15:35.058 --> 15:36.625
of exquisite oil.

15:36.660 --> 15:39.795
Jesus Christ, Stu.
A vat?

15:39.830 --> 15:42.164
You make me sound like
I'm all stretched out and shit.

15:42.199 --> 15:44.200
- Shut up!
- We had a nice sex life

15:44.234 --> 15:45.401
ourselves, you know.
It wasn't crazy or anything.

15:45.435 --> 15:47.737
- Ugh! Oy.
- A finger up the ass

15:47.771 --> 15:50.406
every now and again.
A botched threesome or two,

15:50.440 --> 15:52.174
but it was quite familiar,
comforting.

15:52.209 --> 15:54.810
You have quite a fan club,
don't you?

15:54.845 --> 15:59.382
Yeah, looks like
I'm queen of the shit pile.

15:59.416 --> 16:00.816
Go.
Get the fuck out of here.

16:00.851 --> 16:01.884
Yeah.

16:01.918 --> 16:03.078
Leave your ex-wife with me.

16:03.086 --> 16:04.820
Oh.

16:04.855 --> 16:06.822
We're gonna have a chat.

16:06.857 --> 16:09.725
Okay.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.228
Hey.

16:15.632 --> 16:17.900
So you and Hank, huh?

16:17.934 --> 16:20.202
Once upon a time.

16:20.237 --> 16:22.738
And you and Hank.

16:22.773 --> 16:25.141
Sorta kinda.
Something.

16:25.175 --> 16:28.778
- He's really talented.
- Yeah.

16:28.812 --> 16:31.347
He's talented, but...

16:31.381 --> 16:33.416
he has a really hard time
sustaining it.

16:33.450 --> 16:35.785
Well, I don't know.
I think maybe he just needs

16:35.819 --> 16:38.154
to find the right motivation.

16:38.188 --> 16:42.491
Oh, God, I so know
where you're at right now.

16:42.526 --> 16:43.926
You just see all this potential,
right?

16:43.960 --> 16:46.796
Yeah.

16:46.863 --> 16:48.731
Yeah.
Potential's exciting.

16:48.765 --> 16:49.932
Yeah, it is.

16:49.966 --> 16:51.200
But it's really hard to have

16:51.234 --> 16:52.268
a long-term relationship

16:52.302 --> 16:53.969
with someone else's potential.

16:54.004 --> 16:57.139
Especially if that is
what you're looking for.

16:57.174 --> 17:01.277
I'd be careful if I was you.

17:01.311 --> 17:03.579
And I kind of was you.

17:03.613 --> 17:06.147
You're gonna get hurt.

17:09.185 --> 17:11.554
♪

17:11.588 --> 17:13.422
Methinks you like this one,
Faith.

17:13.457 --> 17:14.790
What do you think?

17:14.825 --> 17:16.791
She likes him.
I can tell.

17:16.827 --> 17:18.627
Who, Hank?

17:18.662 --> 17:21.464
Yeah.
I like him.

17:21.498 --> 17:22.798
I like him as much as any guy

17:22.833 --> 17:24.300
that I choose
to spend my time with.

17:24.334 --> 17:26.969
I've seen you on the arm
of lots of guys.

17:27.002 --> 17:29.238
You seem to have
a real connection with this one.

17:29.272 --> 17:32.274
He's a good guy.
He's sweet to you.

17:32.309 --> 17:33.742
Maybe it could be a real thing.

17:33.777 --> 17:35.611
You do not have
to live happily ever after

17:35.645 --> 17:37.413
with someone to make it real.

17:37.447 --> 17:39.448
Oh, be good to yourself, Faith.

17:39.483 --> 17:41.417
You deserve it.

17:41.451 --> 17:43.619
Shut up and deal.

17:47.524 --> 17:49.124
If I had to pick,

17:49.159 --> 17:53.028
I would say <i>Fetch Live,</i>
<i>All Over Your Face</i>

17:53.063 --> 17:55.431
because that one
has all your hits.

17:55.465 --> 17:57.333
That's lovely, dear.

17:57.367 --> 17:59.802
So would you like to blow me,

17:59.836 --> 18:02.304
or would you prefer
to have actual intercourse?

18:02.339 --> 18:05.474
God. Jeez.
I don't know.

18:05.509 --> 18:07.343
I hadn't really thought
about it, so...

18:08.812 --> 18:10.379
That's cute.

18:10.413 --> 18:12.114
Of course you thought about it.

18:12.148 --> 18:14.483
Mm.
Do you want to go down on me?

18:14.518 --> 18:17.219
Mm.
I'd prefer not to.

18:17.254 --> 18:18.921
It's a little bit intimate

18:18.955 --> 18:22.358
and also, to be honest,
a little bit boring for me.

18:22.392 --> 18:26.061
Of course, because I'm
just another bang to you.

18:26.096 --> 18:27.730
- Yeah.
- Not at all.

18:27.764 --> 18:30.299
The knowledge
that I'm giving you this gift,

18:30.333 --> 18:34.336
this opportunity to transcend
your everyday suburban existence

18:34.371 --> 18:36.438
and have sex
with a fucking rock star,

18:36.473 --> 18:37.740
thereby giving you a story
to dine out on

18:37.774 --> 18:38.974
for years to come,

18:39.009 --> 18:40.576
that's the fun bit for me.

18:40.610 --> 18:43.045
I don't know, man.
This is just so fucked up.

18:43.079 --> 18:46.181
I mean, just--
just take me, okay?

18:46.216 --> 18:48.884
I mean, that's what Rick
Springfield would have done.

18:48.919 --> 18:51.387
He just tore my clothes off
and stuck it in,

18:51.421 --> 18:53.589
so just fucking do
what you want,

18:53.623 --> 18:56.358
but just fucking do it already,
all right?

18:56.393 --> 18:57.793
Just fucking go.
Go.

19:03.400 --> 19:05.034
Hey, you guys.

19:05.068 --> 19:06.902
Hey, did you read
that <i>Times</i> article

19:06.937 --> 19:08.270
about the guy
who did the thing,

19:08.305 --> 19:09.738
and then this other thing
happened?

19:09.773 --> 19:10.940
I don't know about you,

19:10.974 --> 19:12.775
but I found it fascinating.

19:12.809 --> 19:16.011
Hank, I am having
an intimate moment with Karen,

19:16.046 --> 19:17.446
and I will not let you spoil it

19:17.480 --> 19:18.714
with your incessant
verbal diarrhea.

19:18.748 --> 19:20.516
What is it, Hank?

19:20.550 --> 19:21.990
Are you not getting
enough attention?

19:22.018 --> 19:23.752
Where is he?

19:23.787 --> 19:25.087
Where's Atticus?

19:25.121 --> 19:26.555
I haven't the foggiest,
my love.

19:26.590 --> 19:29.024
Okay, well, I'm prepared
to forgive him.

19:29.059 --> 19:30.859
- Why?
- Well, here I was,

19:30.894 --> 19:33.629
all pissed off,
calling every divorce lawyer

19:33.663 --> 19:35.631
I know,
and look what come in the mail.

19:35.665 --> 19:38.968
Three, count 'em, three
seven-figure royalty checks.

19:39.002 --> 19:40.469
Oh, cool.

19:40.503 --> 19:43.305
I'm so lucky.
My life's fucking amazing.

19:43.340 --> 19:45.140
I mean, if he wants
to eat a Mars bar

19:45.175 --> 19:46.308
out of
some dirty skank's poontang,

19:46.343 --> 19:47.743
who am I to judge, hmm?

19:47.777 --> 19:50.346
Well, that is
a beautiful rationalization,

19:50.380 --> 19:51.647
but I think in this case
you have a right

19:51.681 --> 19:53.415
to be slightly miffed.

19:53.450 --> 19:55.084
Oh, darling, it's just sex.

19:55.118 --> 19:56.485
Why does everyone make
such a big deal about it?

19:56.519 --> 19:58.654
Fuck if I know, dude.

20:02.125 --> 20:03.759
- Move.
- Sorry, missus,

20:03.793 --> 20:05.260
I can't do that.

20:05.295 --> 20:07.162
Sorry, missus,
I can't do that.

20:15.605 --> 20:17.506
Hello, darling.

20:17.540 --> 20:18.574
Oh.

20:18.608 --> 20:20.142
Is all forgiven?

20:20.176 --> 20:24.246
You fucking fuckface.

20:24.280 --> 20:27.383
Fuck!
Are those my royalty checks?

20:27.417 --> 20:30.019
Get out of my way.

20:30.053 --> 20:31.887
I'm sorry.
Ugh.

20:36.159 --> 20:38.794
Come on.

20:42.132 --> 20:44.333
Enough of this foolish
cat-and-mouse game.

20:44.367 --> 20:48.303
You are gonna fuck
my brains out,

20:48.338 --> 20:49.605
and you're gonna fuck 'em out
now.

20:49.639 --> 20:51.173
No means no, you know.

20:51.207 --> 20:53.308
You say no, but your cock here

20:53.343 --> 20:55.077
- begs to differ.
- No, don't listen to him.

20:55.111 --> 20:56.311
He does not have
decision-making authority.

20:56.346 --> 20:57.780
Do you know what it takes

20:57.814 --> 20:59.048
- to be a rock star's wife, Hank?
- No.

20:59.082 --> 21:01.183
I have certain skills.

21:01.217 --> 21:03.352
I know how to give the kind
of sharp and focused head

21:03.386 --> 21:04.920
that cuts through the bullshit.

21:04.954 --> 21:06.354
- Sharp?
- Plenty of women out there

21:06.356 --> 21:08.223
all are licking lollipops.

21:08.258 --> 21:10.526
They're lazy.
They're entitled.

21:10.560 --> 21:12.161
They think just by putting it
in their mouth,

21:12.195 --> 21:13.796
that's all they need to do,
but you and I know

21:13.830 --> 21:16.198
- that's just the beginning.
- Right.

21:16.232 --> 21:18.333
I know how to get shit done.

21:18.368 --> 21:20.402
Now your cock's on the verge
of making a decision, Hank.

21:20.437 --> 21:23.038
What's it gonna be?

21:24.941 --> 21:27.643
- Everything okay in here?
- Things are not as they seem.

21:27.677 --> 21:29.344
Can you give us
a fucking minute here?

21:29.379 --> 21:30.879
- You don't want to do this.
- I do.

21:30.914 --> 21:32.681
No, no, no.
You love your husband.

21:32.716 --> 21:34.349
- I do.
- Yeah.

21:34.384 --> 21:36.585
These are not the droids
you're looking for.

21:39.189 --> 21:40.456
Fuck.

21:40.490 --> 21:42.024
Ah, fuck.

21:42.058 --> 21:44.359
Ugh, Jesus.

21:46.396 --> 21:47.596
Whoo!

21:47.630 --> 21:50.899
Thank you.
That was perfect timing.

21:50.934 --> 21:52.334
I had a feeling you might need
a little rescuing.

21:52.368 --> 21:54.303
Yeah.

21:56.106 --> 21:57.706
- What?
- Hmm.

22:05.281 --> 22:07.449
Fuck.

22:07.484 --> 22:09.485
- I get it.
- Sorry.

22:09.519 --> 22:12.988
You should go.
Go, go, go.

22:18.995 --> 22:21.764
Karen.
Karen, this is bullshit.

22:21.798 --> 22:23.198
He poops on people.

22:23.233 --> 22:25.534
Maybe not anymore,
but he has in the past,

22:25.568 --> 22:29.972
and that is--that's a serious
fucking character flaw.

22:37.680 --> 22:39.715
They've been in there
a really long time.

22:39.749 --> 22:41.083
Maybe they're just talking.

22:41.117 --> 22:43.152
You know,
like we're just talking.

22:43.186 --> 22:45.087
Sure.

22:45.121 --> 22:47.055
- Right. Just talking.
- Yeah.

22:47.090 --> 22:50.025
My advice,
just fucking move on, dude.

22:50.059 --> 22:51.927
I'm not sure that's possible.

22:51.961 --> 22:54.062
You can't begrudge your lady
for going off with Eddie Nero.

22:54.097 --> 22:55.430
Dude's fucking handsome.

22:55.465 --> 22:58.133
Yeah, but Karen's
not like that.

22:58.168 --> 22:59.902
What kind of fucked up
Madonna whore shit is that?

22:59.936 --> 23:01.436
What, just 'cause you love her,

23:01.471 --> 23:03.038
just 'cause she crapped out
your kid,

23:03.072 --> 23:04.633
she's not entitled
to bang a movie star?

23:04.641 --> 23:06.542
Well, sure she can,
but that doesn't mean

23:06.576 --> 23:07.910
I can't be majorly pissed off
about it.

23:07.944 --> 23:09.278
Okay.

23:09.312 --> 23:10.746
Then play it cool, man.

23:10.780 --> 23:12.915
That's the move.

23:12.949 --> 23:14.650
Never let the bitches
see you sweat.

23:16.786 --> 23:18.453
Moody.

23:21.024 --> 23:24.960
That woman is amazing.

23:28.264 --> 23:29.464
Ow!
Not the face.

23:29.499 --> 23:30.966
Never the face.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.234
You hit me in my face.

23:32.268 --> 23:33.302
That's a national treasure.

23:33.336 --> 23:35.470
That's an act of treason.

23:37.307 --> 23:39.308
Oh!
Motherfucker!

23:39.342 --> 23:41.109
- Come on.
- I think I pulled a hammie.

23:41.144 --> 23:43.378
Cocksucker.
Son of a shitty, fucking--

23:43.413 --> 23:45.981
Now the drunken master.

23:48.251 --> 23:50.118
Fuck, get away
from my fucking table!

23:50.153 --> 23:53.088
God damn it.
Fuck.

23:56.092 --> 23:59.494
Oh, shit.

23:59.529 --> 24:01.296
Now it begins.

24:03.600 --> 24:06.001
Okay, then.

24:07.737 --> 24:10.172
Ladies and gentlemen,

24:10.206 --> 24:14.042
yes, I have an announcement
to make.

24:14.077 --> 24:18.580
I have fucked up this storied
life something proper.

24:18.615 --> 24:19.882
All my life,

24:19.916 --> 24:22.150
I have loved exactly one woman

24:22.185 --> 24:24.186
with all my heart.

24:24.220 --> 24:26.822
Have I fucked countless others?

24:26.856 --> 24:28.056
Yes.

24:28.091 --> 24:31.493
Does that make me a bad man?

24:31.527 --> 24:33.028
I-I don't think so.

24:33.062 --> 24:36.431
But, in the court
of public opinion,

24:36.466 --> 24:38.166
I am a scoundrel,

24:38.201 --> 24:41.303
a rogue, a rake.

24:41.337 --> 24:44.907
Perhaps even a rapscallion.

24:48.578 --> 24:50.345
But the fact is

24:50.380 --> 24:54.716
I can't live without you,
Natalie.

24:54.751 --> 24:56.852
Olly, no,
put the fucking gun down.

24:56.886 --> 25:00.889
- Olly. Put it down.
- Olly? Really? Olly?

25:00.924 --> 25:02.891
Did you really think
he was born Atticus Fetch?

25:02.926 --> 25:04.860
It's true, Hank.

25:04.894 --> 25:07.562
I had to create Atticus Fetch.

25:07.597 --> 25:11.466
And now I have to kill him
before he kills me.

25:11.501 --> 25:12.968
That doesn't make any sense.

25:13.002 --> 25:14.836
No, it makes a lot
of sense actually.

25:14.871 --> 25:16.138
Yeah, he created a monster,

25:16.172 --> 25:17.873
and now he wants
to kill the monster

25:17.907 --> 25:19.808
before the monster kills him.

25:19.842 --> 25:21.009
I mean, I've felt that way
myself.

25:21.044 --> 25:23.145
I'm sure a lot of people have.

25:23.179 --> 25:25.247
You're not alone, Atticus.

25:25.281 --> 25:28.383
Um, I'm sure
we can work it all out.

25:28.418 --> 25:30.686
Wait, does that mean
you'll take me back?

25:30.720 --> 25:31.787
Fuck no.

25:31.821 --> 25:33.422
You're a lying, cheating,

25:33.456 --> 25:35.324
fucking scumbag.
Wah!

25:35.358 --> 25:37.926
- Okay, I'll take you back.
- Really?

25:37.961 --> 25:40.295
- You will?
- We'll figure it out, doll.

25:40.330 --> 25:43.298
I'm just gonna have to keep you
on a very short leash.

25:43.333 --> 25:45.267
That sounds good.
I like the sound of that.

25:45.301 --> 25:48.904
That's what this boy needs,
some discipline,

25:48.938 --> 25:51.106
- a little mother's discipline.
- Mommy's discipline.

25:51.140 --> 25:53.175
Okay, now,
just give me the gun.

25:53.209 --> 25:55.610
Give mama the gun.
Come on.

25:55.645 --> 25:58.613
Come on.
There we go.

26:01.718 --> 26:03.685
Ow!

26:03.720 --> 26:05.654
Why did you hit me?

26:05.688 --> 26:09.658
It's not even fucking loaded,
you pussy.

26:32.982 --> 26:34.950
Can you slow down?

26:34.984 --> 26:36.885
I don't know
why you're so fucking angry.

26:36.919 --> 26:38.820
I'm not the one who disappeared
into the bedroom

26:38.855 --> 26:40.989
with that fucking
weirdo degenerate.

26:41.024 --> 26:43.058
You've got a fucking nerve
to take issue

26:43.092 --> 26:45.027
with anything I do ever.

26:45.061 --> 26:46.361
Yes, no, I--
you're right,

26:46.396 --> 26:47.662
but what am I supposed to do,

26:47.697 --> 26:49.531
just sit there
and watch it happen?

26:49.565 --> 26:53.668
Karen, why the fuck did you
come here tonight anyway?

26:53.703 --> 26:55.971
You know why?

26:56.005 --> 26:59.307
Because there's always this
voice in the back of my head

26:59.342 --> 27:01.910
that says, "Maybe this time
it will be different.

27:01.944 --> 27:05.180
"Maybe the stars will align,

27:05.214 --> 27:07.382
"and there will be
this magic moment between us

27:07.417 --> 27:10.252
where everything
will be okay again."

27:14.957 --> 27:17.959
But there's always something
or someone in the way.

27:17.994 --> 27:19.528
Karen, you want me
not to see anybody else,

27:19.562 --> 27:20.929
just say the word.

27:20.963 --> 27:22.597
But if you keep me
at arm's length,

27:22.632 --> 27:24.266
what am I supposed to do,
just sit around

27:24.300 --> 27:26.768
with a cock cage on
and hope that you're gonna have

27:26.803 --> 27:28.236
some kind of epiphany about us?

27:28.271 --> 27:29.551
Do you honestly think
that I care

27:29.572 --> 27:32.340
about you fucking someone else?

27:32.375 --> 27:34.109
If we're not together,
I don't expect you

27:34.143 --> 27:36.378
to have taken
some vow of celibacy.

27:36.412 --> 27:40.449
It's just, when I see
someone look at you

27:40.483 --> 27:44.052
the way that I used
to look at you,

27:44.087 --> 27:46.021
I fucking hate that.

27:46.055 --> 27:50.425
It makes me sick to my stomach.
