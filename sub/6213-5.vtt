WEBVTT

00:10.911 --> 00:12.346
You're perfect.

00:12.679 --> 00:15.249
And I was worried
you'd never meet anybody.

00:15.249 --> 00:16.683
So, who's the lucky girl?

00:16.683 --> 00:18.018
This is no girl.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.953
This is a woman--

00:19.953 --> 00:22.756
the lovely and talented
Adrienne Barbeau

00:22.756 --> 00:25.926
star of the 1982
cinema classic, <i>Swamp Thing.</i>

00:26.527 --> 00:27.995
This'll be a first--

00:27.995 --> 00:30.030
watching you get rejected
by cardboard.

00:30.497 --> 00:32.366
Goodman, you're a freak.

00:32.366 --> 00:36.470
To you. To the 1,200 guys
I outbid on eBay, I'm a god.

00:36.970 --> 00:38.772
The most incredible thing
happened today.

00:38.772 --> 00:41.008
The <i>second</i> most
incredible thing.

00:41.141 --> 00:43.076
Don't ask.
Don't tell.

00:43.076 --> 00:44.011
So, what happened?

00:44.278 --> 00:45.846
The campus radio station
accepted our proposal.

00:45.846 --> 00:46.947
We got our own show!

00:46.947 --> 00:48.849
Oh, I don't know about
this whole radio thing.

00:48.849 --> 00:51.285
We wrote up the proposal
for that at the end
of last year.

00:51.285 --> 00:52.920
I don't even remember
what we proposed.

00:52.920 --> 00:54.688
Well, to quote you,
"A groundbreaking mix

00:54.688 --> 00:56.123
"of edgy talk,
music and politics

00:56.123 --> 00:58.492
that breaks the
mold and shakes up
the student booty."

00:58.492 --> 01:00.594
Ooh. That's supposed
to be "body."

01:00.594 --> 01:02.829
I hope that's not
why we got the job.

01:02.963 --> 01:04.665
We are so dead.
How are we going to fill up

01:04.665 --> 01:06.633
two hours
three nights a week?

01:06.633 --> 01:07.734
Well, we have tons
to talk about.

01:07.734 --> 01:10.037
You and I lead very
exciting lives.

01:10.037 --> 01:12.606
I spilled a little grape juice
on her.

01:13.907 --> 01:17.277
Okay, we've got two days to get
<i>really</i> exciting lives.

01:20.080 --> 01:26.787
♪ Life's changing around me,
and I'm gonna make it mine ♪

01:26.787 --> 01:32.826
♪ I'm reaching out
and living by my rules... ♪

01:32.826 --> 01:35.996
♪ Time's moving way too fast ♪

01:35.996 --> 01:40.701
♪ I wanna make it last... ♪

01:42.135 --> 01:45.639
♪ 'Cause I'm out on my own now ♪

01:45.639 --> 01:51.111
♪ And I like the way it feels. ♪

01:59.553 --> 02:01.622
Spellman, how do I look
for our first show?

02:01.622 --> 02:03.690
Amazing. I mean,
you look great in that top.

02:03.690 --> 02:04.992
Uh, point of order.

02:04.992 --> 02:06.159
You're doing a radio show.

02:06.159 --> 02:07.861
You can go to work
wearing <i>my clothes.</i>

02:07.861 --> 02:09.963
Ew!
Ew!

02:11.965 --> 02:14.601
WOMAN ( <i>over TV</i> ):
Come into the plank.

02:14.601 --> 02:16.570
Drop into cataranga.

02:17.337 --> 02:19.439
Then come into cobra.

02:19.439 --> 02:22.009
Oh! I think I'm broken.

02:22.009 --> 02:24.678
No pain, no gain.
Suck it up, sister.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.847
Remember, to achieve true peace

02:26.847 --> 02:29.282
one must remove oneself
from the outer world

02:29.282 --> 02:32.285
and embrace the silence within.

02:32.285 --> 02:34.521
Hilda, stop whimpering.

02:34.521 --> 02:36.056
I didn't know I was.

02:36.056 --> 02:38.291
Talk about being
out of touch with your body.

02:38.291 --> 02:39.092
( <i>dog whimpers</i> )
Wait a minute.

02:39.092 --> 02:41.561
That noise isn't
coming from you.

02:41.561 --> 02:43.063
That's coming from out front.

02:43.063 --> 02:46.500
Oh, please let it be a
door-to-door chiropractor.

02:48.035 --> 02:51.371
Look! It's a dog. Oh...

02:51.371 --> 02:53.640
Oh, it's so cute.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.776
Can we keep it?
Can we? Can we? Can we?

02:55.776 --> 02:58.812
Oh, Hilda, I'm sure the dog
already has an owner.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.547
I don't see one.

03:00.547 --> 03:02.549
I'm sorry.
We absolutely cannot...

03:02.549 --> 03:03.316
oh...

03:03.316 --> 03:07.187
let this precious creature
perish on the street.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.556
Come on in, poochie.

03:10.123 --> 03:11.291
What a little doggie-woggie.

03:11.291 --> 03:12.526
Come here, come here.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.861
Hello. Hello.

03:15.062 --> 03:17.497
SALEM:
What is that
desperately needy thing

03:17.497 --> 03:20.534
doing on all fours, and
when did she get a dog?

03:20.534 --> 03:23.403
Oh, Salem, show a little respect
for your new-found...

03:23.837 --> 03:24.671
brother.

03:25.172 --> 03:26.807
He'll rip me to shreds!

03:27.140 --> 03:28.809
He'll skin me alive!

03:28.809 --> 03:31.912
Oh-ho, nice doggie.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.613
Aw, look at the two brothers.

03:33.613 --> 03:35.549
Aw... You know what?

03:35.549 --> 03:37.517
I bet they'd love
to share a pot roast.

03:37.517 --> 03:41.121
This could work out
after all, <i>bro.</i>

03:41.121 --> 03:43.156
Oh, you are kind of cute.

03:43.156 --> 03:45.225
I wonder what we
should call you.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.660
Your worst nightmare.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.895
( <i>gasps and yells</i> )

03:50.197 --> 03:51.264
This is so exciting.

03:51.264 --> 03:52.766
Roxie, which microphone
do you want?

03:52.766 --> 03:55.569
Do they have one
that doesn't work?

03:55.569 --> 03:57.070
I just can't do this.
You'll be fine

03:57.070 --> 03:59.372
and even if you
make a mistake,
nobody'll care.

03:59.372 --> 04:03.410
Oh, we're on in five,
four, three, two...

04:04.244 --> 04:06.413
Hey! Welcome to "Chick Chat"

04:06.413 --> 04:09.082
with your hosts,
Sabrina Spellman and...

04:09.716 --> 04:11.017
Hello.

04:11.017 --> 04:12.886
Roxie King. That's right.

04:12.886 --> 04:16.089
Roxie King and Sabrina Spellman
on "Chick Chat."

04:16.089 --> 04:18.525
You know, get it?
We took the "it" out of "chit"

04:18.525 --> 04:21.428
and we substituted it
with "ick."

04:22.896 --> 04:25.766
So, Roxie, what's on your mind?

04:25.766 --> 04:27.868
I don't know.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.369
What's on yours?

04:29.369 --> 04:31.772
Well, uh...

04:32.539 --> 04:34.307
you know...

04:34.508 --> 04:36.476
lots of... stuff

04:36.476 --> 04:39.246
and... um...

04:39.246 --> 04:42.983
Maybe we should,
uh, kick things off
with some dope jams.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.384
( <i>sighs</i> )

04:44.384 --> 04:47.187
Ooh, man, talking on the radio
is a lot harder than I thought.

04:47.187 --> 04:48.221
I told you.

04:48.221 --> 04:49.122
Well, we'll be fine.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.258
I mean, all we have to do
is chill with the trance

04:51.258 --> 04:52.793
and then we'll be free-stylin'.

04:53.426 --> 04:54.895
I downloaded some jargon

04:54.895 --> 04:55.929
off the Internet.

04:59.199 --> 05:01.201
Welcome back to "Chick Chat."

05:01.201 --> 05:04.437
So I guess we chicks
should start chatting.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.543
Maybe we should
remind our callers

05:09.543 --> 05:13.113
that our phone lines
are still open.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.816
Wide open.

05:16.249 --> 05:18.118
They're open.

05:23.256 --> 05:27.494
Um, you know, if you get
a busy signal, keep trying.

05:29.329 --> 05:32.165
Can you try a little
harder, people?

05:32.165 --> 05:35.235
Or are you so busy
hiding in your academic cocoons

05:35.235 --> 05:38.405
that you have
absolutely nothing to say?

05:38.405 --> 05:40.440
Look! We got a call!
What should we do?

05:40.440 --> 05:41.942
I know! Answer it.

05:43.643 --> 05:45.745
Welcome to "Chick Chat."

05:45.745 --> 05:46.980
This is Roxie.

05:46.980 --> 05:49.482
My name is Angie,
and, Roxie, you're totally right

05:49.482 --> 05:51.184
about the academic cocoon thing.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.587
Sometimes I feel like
I'm so buried in my books

05:53.587 --> 05:55.789
that I have no idea
what's going on in the world.

05:55.789 --> 05:56.890
What should I do?

05:56.890 --> 05:58.058
Uh...

05:58.892 --> 06:01.161
ask somebody?

06:01.528 --> 06:03.530
You bring up a
good point, Angie.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.432
I mean, when you
think about it

06:05.432 --> 06:07.033
who knows more
about Hell

06:07.033 --> 06:09.169
the guy who reads Dante's
<i>Inferno</i>

06:09.169 --> 06:12.105
or the guy who's living
in a rat trap in Southie?

06:12.105 --> 06:14.307
You're absolutely right.

06:14.307 --> 06:16.977
I just think we need to find
a balance in our lives.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.278
Right, Sabrina?

06:19.212 --> 06:20.947
My partner agrees.

06:20.947 --> 06:22.282
Okay, next caller.

06:22.282 --> 06:24.150
Talk to us,
Adams College.

06:24.150 --> 06:27.087
I'm telling you,
that dog is evil incarnate.

06:27.087 --> 06:29.623
Oh, Salem, you said that
about the gardener

06:29.623 --> 06:31.091
the mailman <i>and</i> us.

06:31.091 --> 06:33.960
If he was so evil, would
he have brought us popcorn?

06:33.960 --> 06:36.529
The cheesy kind? Our favorite.

06:36.596 --> 06:39.499
I'm telling you, he's a lowlife
from the Other Realm.

06:39.499 --> 06:41.968
He swore he was going
to make our lives a nightmare.

06:41.968 --> 06:44.070
So now the evil one talks?

06:44.070 --> 06:46.239
Who's a good baby?
Who's a good baby?

06:46.239 --> 06:50.277
Hey, that's a cute name.
Let's call him Baby.

06:50.744 --> 06:53.747
Believe me, I'm as
fed up with women's
fashion as you are.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.582
We're totally
pressured by society

06:55.582 --> 06:57.484
to be obsessed
with our appearance.

06:57.484 --> 06:58.952
I mean, just tonight,
my cohost and I

06:58.952 --> 07:02.555
spent an hour getting
ready for a <i>radio</i> show.

07:02.555 --> 07:04.557
Isn't that insane, Sabrina?

07:04.557 --> 07:08.295
Oh, actually, I think the word
I would use is... "insane"

07:08.295 --> 07:12.165
which... I believe,
is the word you used. Good word.

07:12.165 --> 07:13.800
Well, that's it for today.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.001
Join us again next time

07:15.001 --> 07:19.105
for another hard-hitting edition
of "Chick Chat"!

07:19.105 --> 07:21.007
That was so, so cool!

07:21.007 --> 07:23.176
Were we awesome or what?

07:23.176 --> 07:25.578
Well, I think the word
I would use is...

07:25.879 --> 07:27.681
whatever word you used.

07:27.681 --> 07:29.015
We rocked!

07:32.585 --> 07:33.386
( <i>slurping</i> )

07:33.386 --> 07:34.921
( <i>sighs</i> )

07:34.921 --> 07:37.223
( <i>humming happily</i> )

07:38.959 --> 07:40.860
( <i>loud snap</i> )
( <i>Salem screams</i> )

07:40.860 --> 07:42.262
Who would be so demented

07:42.262 --> 07:45.432
as to put a mousetrap
in my private sanctuary?

07:45.432 --> 07:46.766
Howdy doody.

07:47.167 --> 07:48.668
All right!

07:49.602 --> 07:51.304
Cards on the table.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.472
Why are you here?

07:52.472 --> 07:54.107
Why do you think?

07:54.107 --> 07:56.443
To sponge off those
two daffy broads.

07:56.443 --> 07:58.778
That's my racket, Mac.

07:58.778 --> 08:00.680
Not for long, pallie.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.949
And the name is Phil.

08:02.949 --> 08:05.318
Say it with me. Phil.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.920
So, what's your game plan...

08:06.920 --> 08:08.555
( <i>blowing raspberry):</i>
Phhhil?

08:08.555 --> 08:11.358
To get those two broads
to give you the boot.

08:11.358 --> 08:14.461
Unless, of course, you want
to leave of your own free will.

08:14.461 --> 08:17.430
I can assure you,
that is never going to happen.

08:17.430 --> 08:19.866
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going outside

08:19.866 --> 08:22.402
to complete
some unfinished business.

08:22.402 --> 08:23.436
( <i>chuckles softly</i> )

08:24.070 --> 08:25.505
Ow!

08:26.006 --> 08:28.141
Glad I went with the granite.

08:28.141 --> 08:29.709
( <i>whimpering</i> )

08:29.709 --> 08:33.847
Of course, you realize
this means war.

08:35.248 --> 08:36.116
Freezing her for later?

08:36.116 --> 08:39.119
Mock me if you must,
but in a matter of hours

08:39.119 --> 08:43.156
the bodacious Ms. Barbeau
has increased in value by 2.9%.

08:43.390 --> 08:44.891
Oh, by the way,
great show tonight.

08:44.891 --> 08:46.659
Thanks. I told you
we were awesome.

08:46.659 --> 08:49.462
We're even scoring
with the men-who-love-
cardboard crowd.

08:49.462 --> 08:50.830
Good night.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.834
Miles, I know you liked the
show, but tell me the truth.

08:54.834 --> 08:57.003
Did I make a
fool of myself?

08:57.003 --> 08:59.339
No good could come of my answer.

08:59.339 --> 09:01.741
I stunk. I just couldn't
think on my feet.

09:01.741 --> 09:03.643
You know, I always thought
I'd be a natural on the radio

09:03.643 --> 09:05.478
but it turns out
that Roxie's the natural.

09:05.478 --> 09:07.680
Well, hey, when it
comes to performing,
everybody's different.

09:07.680 --> 09:10.083
Some people can be spontaneous

09:10.083 --> 09:13.453
and other people, like me,
need to organize, prepare

09:13.453 --> 09:15.088
throw up a few times.

09:15.088 --> 09:16.456
Thanks for sharing that, Miles.

09:16.456 --> 09:18.591
You'll let me know if there's
anything I can do for you.

09:18.591 --> 09:21.161
Actually, there is.
Do you have any bubble wrap?

09:21.161 --> 09:22.162
No.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.098
Hey, I thought we were
going to walk over together.

09:25.098 --> 09:27.434
Oh, um, yeah, well,
I wanted to get here early

09:27.434 --> 09:29.235
and go over some show ideas.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.304
For today or
the whole year?

09:31.504 --> 09:34.240
Well, you know,
it never hurts to be prepared.

09:35.475 --> 09:38.945
<i>"Everything You Always Wanted</i>
<i>to Know About Everything."</i>

09:38.945 --> 09:40.146
Oh, yeah.

09:40.146 --> 09:42.015
There are some amazing facts
in here.

09:42.015 --> 09:43.883
I mean, did you know that
pirates used to wear earrings

09:43.883 --> 09:45.118
because they thought
piercing their ears

09:45.118 --> 09:46.820
would improve their eyesight?

09:46.820 --> 09:48.855
I did not know that.

09:49.656 --> 09:54.961
Okay, we're on in five,
four, three, two...

09:54.961 --> 09:56.463
Welcome to "Chick Chat"

09:56.463 --> 09:58.998
with Roxie King and me,
Sabrina Spellman.

09:58.998 --> 10:00.600
I've prepared
some interesting

10:00.600 --> 10:02.902
and very neatly arranged
topics for tonight

10:02.902 --> 10:05.004
and I'm only slightly nauseous.

10:05.205 --> 10:06.906
Thanks for the "heads up."

10:07.273 --> 10:08.541
Here's a topic.

10:08.541 --> 10:11.478
"Let's talk about
the skyrocketing cost

10:11.478 --> 10:13.847
"of tuition at Adams College.

10:13.847 --> 10:15.715
"Two years ago,
tuition went up

10:15.715 --> 10:17.217
"11%.

10:17.217 --> 10:19.819
"Last year it went up
another eight.

10:19.819 --> 10:21.321
"How is this trend
going to affect

10:21.321 --> 10:25.925
"the cost of education
in the...

10:25.925 --> 10:26.926
future?"

10:28.261 --> 10:29.429
A numbers game.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.131
Who can afford to play?

10:31.131 --> 10:33.166
Talk to us, Adams.

10:33.333 --> 10:36.136
Oh, see, I knew this
would get people thinking.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.470
You're on with Sabrina.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.639
MAN:
On the last show,
Roxie was talking

10:39.639 --> 10:42.175
about how women
are slaves to fashion.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.110
Well, men are victims, too.

10:44.110 --> 10:47.213
I don't have much money
to spend on clothes...

10:47.213 --> 10:50.216
Which feeds right into
Sabrina's tuition issue.

10:50.216 --> 10:52.819
I mean, how can kids afford
to buy the hippest stuff

10:52.819 --> 10:55.221
if every penny they spend
is on their education?

10:55.221 --> 10:56.990
Any thoughts, Sabrina?

10:56.990 --> 10:58.591
Uh, let me check.

10:58.725 --> 11:00.527
Peer pressure is an
enormous problem.

11:00.527 --> 11:03.096
Not just with fashion
but with drugs, drinking...

11:03.096 --> 11:04.597
Oh, here's something
about drinking.

11:04.597 --> 11:08.034
It says here that if you
stick your finger in a soda

11:08.034 --> 11:09.068
it goes flat.

11:09.068 --> 11:10.336
How does that relate

11:10.336 --> 11:10.904
to anything

11:10.904 --> 11:12.438
we've been talking about?

11:12.438 --> 11:15.074
I don't know. Let me check.

11:15.408 --> 11:19.078
My fantasy guy-- take
Tom Cruise's eyes,
Steve Martin's wit

11:19.078 --> 11:21.247
and toss lightly with Brad
Pitt's everything else.

11:21.247 --> 11:23.550
So, who's your
fantasy woman?

11:23.550 --> 11:25.518
MAN:
You. You're smart and funny

11:25.518 --> 11:27.987
and you're not afraid
to speak your mind.

11:27.987 --> 11:30.290
I love the "Roxie King Show."

11:33.960 --> 11:36.262
Sabrina, this is
the way talk shows go.

11:36.262 --> 11:38.731
Tonight people just weren't
interested in your topics.

11:38.731 --> 11:42.001
Well, they didn't even
give me time to look up
stuff in my big book.

11:42.235 --> 11:43.770
Who does a college radio show

11:43.770 --> 11:46.039
with a stack of index cards
and a big book?

11:46.039 --> 11:47.574
Oh, so now you're the expert--

11:47.574 --> 11:50.476
the person I had to drag
kicking and screaming
to even do the show.

11:50.476 --> 11:52.045
I didn't say
I was an expert.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.614
I just think you'd
be better off if
you loosened up.

11:54.614 --> 11:56.916
Well, on the first show,
I was trying to be spontaneous

11:56.916 --> 11:59.185
and Miles thought it'd be
a better idea if I prepared.

11:59.185 --> 12:01.421
Now you're saying,
"Don't prepare; be spontaneous."

12:01.421 --> 12:03.256
Well, I'm not listening
to either one of you.

12:03.256 --> 12:04.457
If you're not going to prepare

12:04.457 --> 12:05.925
and you're not going
to be spontaneous

12:05.925 --> 12:07.527
what does that leave?

12:07.894 --> 12:09.762
Wouldn't you like to know.

12:11.831 --> 12:13.366
Wouldn't <i>I</i> like to know.

12:19.105 --> 12:20.506
We take Baby to
the south of France

12:20.506 --> 12:22.208
for two weeks,
and then shoot over

12:22.208 --> 12:24.544
to Munich for his
first Oktoberfest.

12:24.544 --> 12:27.447
HILDA:
How cute would he look
in lederhosen!

12:28.881 --> 12:31.017
ZELDA:
We'll get him one of those caps
with the feathers

12:31.017 --> 12:32.719
and then maybe teach him
to yodel

12:32.719 --> 12:36.089
and top it off
with a big bratwurst dinner.

12:41.461 --> 12:45.131
Salem Saberhagen,
how could you do
that to poor Baby?!

12:45.131 --> 12:47.634
How could you be so naive?

12:47.634 --> 12:50.270
This bloated beast
is playing you like a violin

12:50.270 --> 12:51.738
while he tries to bump me off.

12:51.738 --> 12:53.406
Don't be ridiculous.

12:53.406 --> 12:56.342
All Baby wants is a wittle wuv.

12:56.342 --> 12:57.644
( <i>groans</i> )

12:57.644 --> 12:59.345
Welcome to <i>Chick Chat.</i>

12:59.345 --> 13:02.315
I'm Sabrina Spellman,
the world's worst radio host.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.350
You're being kind.

13:04.350 --> 13:05.585
Salem, what are
you doing here?

13:05.585 --> 13:09.455
I'm a nosehair away from being
replaced by the Hound from Hell.

13:09.455 --> 13:11.457
I need a shoulder to cry on.

13:11.457 --> 13:12.992
You picked the wrong shoulder.

13:12.992 --> 13:14.994
I'm making a fool of myself
on the radio

13:14.994 --> 13:17.063
while Roxie sits back
and wows everybody.

13:17.063 --> 13:20.433
What do you expect? The girl
was born with the gift of gab.

13:20.433 --> 13:21.467
What was I born with?

13:21.467 --> 13:23.002
A very thick head.

13:23.002 --> 13:24.337
You're a witch.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.172
Of course. If I want
the Gift of Gab

13:26.172 --> 13:28.441
all I have to do
is point and zap.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.016
They're not saying anything.

13:37.016 --> 13:39.185
Give me a subject,
I start gabbing.

13:39.185 --> 13:40.386
Music.

13:40.386 --> 13:41.554
Way too many boy bands.

13:41.554 --> 13:43.589
And please, only one name
per rap artist.

13:43.589 --> 13:46.426
Are you Puff Daddy, Puff Diddy
or Puff the Magic Dragon?

13:46.426 --> 13:47.427
Decide, man.

13:47.427 --> 13:48.461
Movies.

13:48.461 --> 13:51.364
Love 'em. I'd love them
even more if I had my eyes.

13:51.364 --> 13:52.565
Got my eye-teeth though.

13:52.565 --> 13:54.534
Had my wisdom teeth
removed; didn't feel a thing.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.936
It's amazing what's going on
in dentistry today.

13:56.936 --> 13:58.671
Let me ask you
a question.

13:58.671 --> 14:01.207
How would you get
revenge on someone

14:01.207 --> 14:03.676
whose mission it was
to destroy you?

14:03.676 --> 14:04.911
I'm just the Gift of Gab.

14:04.911 --> 14:06.713
"When you're desperate
to get even

14:06.713 --> 14:09.115
call upon
my good friend Steven."

14:10.016 --> 14:12.285
Let me guess.
Even Steven?

14:12.285 --> 14:13.219
Well, originally, Stephan

14:13.219 --> 14:15.788
but "Effen Stephan"
gave people the wrong idea.

14:15.788 --> 14:16.789
Whatever.

14:16.789 --> 14:19.592
Let's go do in the dog!

14:20.426 --> 14:23.096
Well, Gift of Gab,
you're just what I need

14:23.096 --> 14:25.531
and I've got just
what you need.

14:27.567 --> 14:30.737
I'll have a half-caf grande cap,
dry, with non-fat soy milk.

14:30.737 --> 14:32.038
And for the lady?

14:32.038 --> 14:35.775
Nothing. She learned her lesson
after The Grape Juice Incident.

14:36.442 --> 14:38.544
You know, Miles, it's one thing
to keep her in your room

14:38.544 --> 14:40.580
it's another
to take her out on dates.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.415
Unfortunately,
this is our last one.

14:42.415 --> 14:45.251
I just sold her on ebay
for a 10.9% profit.

14:45.251 --> 14:47.320
Any moment now, another
Adrienne Barbeau fanatic

14:47.320 --> 14:49.555
is going to come in here
and rip out my heart.

14:52.692 --> 14:54.594
You must be Miles.

14:56.329 --> 14:58.164
Yes, and I must be dreaming.

14:58.164 --> 14:58.998
You're...

14:59.799 --> 15:01.367
Adrienne Barbeau.

15:01.367 --> 15:03.169
That's what they tell me.

15:03.603 --> 15:06.139
I've been looking for
one of these for years.

15:06.139 --> 15:08.074
You know, I would give it
to you, but I just sold it.

15:08.074 --> 15:11.277
To me. I was the highest bidder.

15:13.446 --> 15:15.314
I am so sorry.

15:15.314 --> 15:16.616
You must think
I'm just a mercenary

15:16.616 --> 15:17.517
who's using you
to make money

15:17.517 --> 15:19.185
when, in reality,
I'm your number-one fan

15:19.185 --> 15:21.854
who worships the swamp
you sludge through.

15:22.855 --> 15:24.590
You are so sweet.

15:25.158 --> 15:25.691
We got to move.

15:25.691 --> 15:28.528
We're on the air
in half an hour.

15:31.831 --> 15:33.232
I've seen everything
you've ever done.

15:33.232 --> 15:34.400
There is no one on the planet

15:34.400 --> 15:36.869
who knows more about you
than I do.

15:36.869 --> 15:38.538
Here you go
Got to go.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.039
Wow, Adrienne Barbeau!

15:40.039 --> 15:41.574
Or should I say
the original Rizzo in <i>Grease.</i>

15:41.574 --> 15:42.909
Congrats on the Tony nomination.

15:42.909 --> 15:43.709
Oh, and...

15:43.709 --> 15:45.178
loved you in <i>The Fog</i>
and <i>Creep Show.</i>

15:45.178 --> 15:46.012
Oh, and then there's TV.

15:46.012 --> 15:47.447
And then there's <i>Maude.</i>

15:47.447 --> 15:48.347
What about <i>Deep Space Nine?</i>

15:48.347 --> 15:50.483
I mean, you played
a fantastic Senator Cretak.

15:50.483 --> 15:52.318
Well, thank you. And you are?

15:52.318 --> 15:54.921
Sabrina Spellman, sophomore at
Adams College founded in 1891...

15:54.921 --> 15:56.589
Oh, I didn't know you knew
so much about Adrienne.

15:56.589 --> 15:59.625
I don't; I just have
the gift of gab. Got to go.

16:03.362 --> 16:06.065
This better not be
public television again.

16:06.065 --> 16:08.768
I give and I give and I give...

16:08.768 --> 16:10.102
Yello.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.671
Ohh!

16:12.038 --> 16:13.906
( <i>quietly</i> ):
Ouch.

16:14.040 --> 16:17.877
Tsk-tsk. Don't you know
smoking stunts your growth?

16:17.877 --> 16:19.545
I am good.

16:20.913 --> 16:25.051
Oh, Steven,
I'm ready to get even.

16:25.051 --> 16:26.385
( <i>chortles</i> )

16:26.385 --> 16:29.522
See, those frames really go
with his coloring.

16:29.522 --> 16:30.490
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

16:30.490 --> 16:31.591
I'll get it.

16:31.858 --> 16:35.328
You are going to be the envy
of every dog in Bavaria.

16:36.629 --> 16:37.763
Hello.

16:37.763 --> 16:38.764
How do you do?

16:38.764 --> 16:40.366
My name is Steven Evenson.

16:40.366 --> 16:43.369
I saw your flyer, and I think
you may have my dog.

16:43.369 --> 16:45.705
Well, it certainly
looks like him.

16:45.705 --> 16:46.606
Who is it?

16:46.606 --> 16:49.141
The man who
owns our Baby.

16:49.141 --> 16:50.510
Oh, no!

16:50.510 --> 16:52.712
I've heard about
horror stories like this.

16:52.712 --> 16:54.380
Adoptive parents
nurture a child

16:54.380 --> 16:55.448
then out of the blue

16:55.448 --> 16:58.050
he's snatched from their arms
by the birth father

16:58.050 --> 17:01.187
Well, guess what,
you can't have him. Get out!

17:01.187 --> 17:05.057
Hilda, if it really is his dog,
we have no right to keep him.

17:05.057 --> 17:07.827
It can't be his dog;
Baby doesn't even recognize him.

17:07.827 --> 17:09.328
Yeah, you're right.

17:09.962 --> 17:11.464
Well, maybe it isn't him.

17:11.464 --> 17:13.866
I mean, even if it was,
he seems happier here.

17:13.866 --> 17:16.202
The truth is, he was just
never very comfortable living

17:16.202 --> 17:18.971
in a 42-room mansion
with his own valet.

17:18.971 --> 17:20.740
Mansion and a valet?

17:20.740 --> 17:23.709
You're welcome to slap
a collar around <i>my</i> neck.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.111
Frankly, he was getting
a bit lethargic

17:25.111 --> 17:26.078
between all the rich food

17:26.078 --> 17:28.214
at the country club
and those luxurious

17:28.214 --> 17:29.815
sails on the yacht.

17:29.815 --> 17:31.050
Big yacht?

17:32.952 --> 17:34.754
Mm, he seems
to know you now.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.589
Yes, he does.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.558
Yeah, but painful
though it may be

17:38.558 --> 17:41.394
I have to do
what's best for him.

17:41.394 --> 17:42.528
I'm leaving
the dog with you.

17:42.528 --> 17:44.430
No! Don't leave me
with these losers.

17:44.430 --> 17:45.464
One's dumb as dirt

17:45.464 --> 17:47.533
the other's got the personality
of a limp noodle.

17:47.533 --> 17:49.168
How dare you talk
about us...

17:49.168 --> 17:50.369
You talked!

17:50.369 --> 17:52.204
He does talk.

17:52.204 --> 17:53.306
Salem was right.

17:53.306 --> 17:54.740
He was just using us.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.976
SALEM:
Giving credence
to the old adage:

17:56.976 --> 18:00.246
"Stick with the User you know."

18:00.980 --> 18:05.384
This whole talking animal thing
must seem a little odd to you.

18:05.384 --> 18:05.985
Not at all.

18:05.985 --> 18:08.321
My real name is Even Steven

18:08.321 --> 18:11.390
and I'm here to take
this slobbering slimeball

18:11.390 --> 18:12.892
to the Other Realm
Obedience School.

18:12.892 --> 18:14.594
Please, give me another chance.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.729
Let me spend the rest
of my life fetching

18:16.729 --> 18:18.698
for the fetching
Spellman sisters.

18:18.698 --> 18:20.666
Aww...
Aww...

18:20.666 --> 18:22.134
Buh-bye.
Buh-bye.

18:26.539 --> 18:28.474
Hey, Roxie, how you doing?
Great to see you.

18:28.474 --> 18:30.409
How 'bout that nippy
fall weather out there?

18:30.409 --> 18:31.644
Somebody's in
a better mood.

18:31.644 --> 18:32.745
Hey, smile and the whole world
smiles with you.

18:32.745 --> 18:33.579
Cry and you cry alone.

18:33.579 --> 18:35.648
Everybody loves
somebody sometime.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.583
Had a couple of double
espressos, did you?

18:37.583 --> 18:39.318
Nope. You're looking
at your new-and-improved cohost.

18:39.318 --> 18:41.454
We're on in five,
four, three, two...

18:41.454 --> 18:43.089
Welcome to <i>Chick Chat</i>

18:43.089 --> 18:45.291
with Roxie King and yours truly,
Sabrina Spellman.

18:45.291 --> 18:46.759
I want to go right to
you guys out there.

18:46.759 --> 18:48.127
What's on your mind?

18:48.127 --> 18:49.462
WOMAN:
I want to talk about

18:49.462 --> 18:51.364
the proliferation
of cell phones.

18:51.364 --> 18:52.565
Man, are they annoying.

18:52.565 --> 18:53.599
Not to me. There's
nothing I like more

18:53.599 --> 18:54.467
than gabbing on a horn.

18:54.467 --> 18:55.868
Speaking of horns,
whatever happened to Kenny G?

18:55.868 --> 18:56.836
And what does
that "G" stand for?

18:56.836 --> 18:58.604
I know it doesn't stand
for "general audiences."

18:58.604 --> 18:59.739
What's a general audience,
anyway?

18:59.739 --> 19:01.707
Eisenhower, Schwarzkopf, Patton?

19:01.707 --> 19:02.875
Next topic.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.678
Mental health.
Specifically, yours.

19:05.678 --> 19:06.946
Oh, never been better,
which is great

19:06.946 --> 19:07.847
because if you haven't
got your health--

19:07.847 --> 19:10.316
and in that, I include dental--
what have you got?

19:10.316 --> 19:11.384
You're speaking
with Sabrina.

19:11.384 --> 19:14.353
MAN:
1 am really sick of the food
in the cafeteria.

19:14.353 --> 19:16.322
Do you know any good
Japanese restaurants?

19:16.322 --> 19:17.189
Japanese?

19:17.189 --> 19:18.624
<i>Asoko wa yap'pari iilnaa</i>

19:18.624 --> 19:19.692
<i>sakana shinsen de</i>

19:19.692 --> 19:21.027
<i>min-na mo iiyatsu jalnaa.</i>

19:21.027 --> 19:23.462
Could you say that
in English, please?

19:23.462 --> 19:24.697
There's a simply
marvelous place downtown

19:24.697 --> 19:25.498
where the fish is tip-top.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.433
Hey, if I wanted
to get ridiculed

19:27.433 --> 19:29.201
I would have
called my mother.

19:29.201 --> 19:31.604
Great topic-- mothers and sons,
very complex relationships

19:31.604 --> 19:33.706
from <i>Oedipus</i> to <i>Macbeth</i>
to <i>My Mother the Car.</i>

19:33.706 --> 19:34.640
Speaking of cars, have you seen

19:34.640 --> 19:36.308
the new gas-electric hybrids?
They're to die for.

19:36.308 --> 19:37.877
<i>To Die For--</i> great movie.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.412
Did you know Nicole Kidman's
from Australia?

19:39.412 --> 19:41.047
Did you know that's where the
duck-billed platypus is from?

19:41.047 --> 19:42.381
By the way, did you know
the duck-billed platypus

19:42.381 --> 19:45.017
is the only mammal
that can lay an egg?

19:45.284 --> 19:47.086
Besides the mammal
that's laying one right now.

19:47.086 --> 19:48.120
So, I'm not very good at this.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.121
Let's go to a musical break.

19:49.121 --> 19:50.222
Good idea.

19:52.491 --> 19:53.459
Sabrina...

19:53.459 --> 19:55.494
what do you think you're doing?

19:55.494 --> 19:57.463
Trying to be something I'm not.

19:57.463 --> 19:58.698
Most things come
really easy to me

19:58.698 --> 20:00.566
but I am not cut out
to be on the radio

20:00.566 --> 20:03.302
and nothing I can do
can magically change that.

20:03.302 --> 20:05.371
Granted, the surreal
Japanese interlude

20:05.371 --> 20:06.839
might have been a mistake.

20:06.839 --> 20:08.741
No, the mistake was thinking
because I'm a decent writer

20:08.741 --> 20:10.009
I'd be good on the radio.

20:10.009 --> 20:10.943
But you're great at this

20:10.943 --> 20:12.945
so I'm not going to get
in your way anymore.

20:12.945 --> 20:15.314
Sabrina, this show
is half yours.

20:15.314 --> 20:17.283
I don't want to take it
away from you.

20:17.283 --> 20:18.818
You don't have to.

20:19.685 --> 20:21.187
Welcome back to <i>Chick Chat.</i>

20:21.187 --> 20:22.688
This is Sabrina,
and due to circumstances

20:22.688 --> 20:25.357
way beyond my control,
this will be my last show.

20:25.357 --> 20:28.227
I know, I know.
"What took me so long?"

20:28.227 --> 20:28.994
Well, now it is my pleasure

20:28.994 --> 20:30.229
to leave you
in the capable hands

20:30.229 --> 20:34.200
of the very talented
and witty Roxie King.

20:40.473 --> 20:42.374
You're on with Roxie.

20:42.374 --> 20:44.376
Talk to me, Adams.

20:48.180 --> 20:51.550
Mmm-mmm!
Nicely done, Zellie.

20:51.550 --> 20:53.385
The short ribs
were only enhanced

20:53.385 --> 20:55.588
by your five-star sauerkraut.

20:55.588 --> 20:56.989
That's meager
compensation

20:56.989 --> 20:59.125
for the shabby way
we treated you.

20:59.125 --> 21:03.162
Next up, lemon sorbet,
followed by a rump roast.

21:03.295 --> 21:05.164
Life is sweet.

21:05.164 --> 21:06.298
Oh, Hilda's going
to be hard pressed

21:06.298 --> 21:07.900
to top your generosity.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.368
Coming through!

21:09.368 --> 21:11.070
Coming through.

21:11.070 --> 21:16.876
Okay, Salem, meet your new
one-stop Elimination Station.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.679
Oh, I'm so happy I could...

21:20.913 --> 21:23.115
I think I will.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.417
( <i>humming happy tune</i> )

21:25.918 --> 21:26.752
( <i>grunting</i> )
