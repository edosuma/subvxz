01:52.679 --> 01:54.681
What the hell
are you doing here?

01:54.681 --> 01:56.683
What do you mean
what am I doing here?

01:56.683 --> 01:59.185
You take an emergency
leave of absence,

01:59.185 --> 02:00.687
grab a Soviet I.D.,

02:00.687 --> 02:02.689
a map of northern Russia,
and you split.

02:02.689 --> 02:04.190
You didn't even
say good-bye to me.

02:04.190 --> 02:07.193
Well, so you just naturally
have to follow me?

02:07.193 --> 02:10.697
Pete... we're friends.

02:10.697 --> 02:13.700
If you got troubles,
I got troubles.

02:13.700 --> 02:16.202
Mac, this one is all mine.

02:16.202 --> 02:17.704
Alexander Karsov.

02:17.704 --> 02:19.205
Candidate for the Nobel,

02:19.205 --> 02:22.709
led a civil rights
protest in Moscow
a while back.

02:22.709 --> 02:24.711
He's got a cabin right
up the river, too,
doesn't he?

02:24.711 --> 02:26.212
How do you know all that?

02:26.212 --> 02:29.215
I, uh, pulled
the operations file
from your office.

02:29.215 --> 02:31.718
How else was
I supposed to find out
where you were, huh?

02:31.718 --> 02:35.722
So, is this Karsov
your problem?

02:35.722 --> 02:40.226
Yeah. He died three days ago,
under police interrogation...

02:40.226 --> 02:42.729
because of his contacts

02:42.729 --> 02:45.231
with an American
secret agent.

02:45.231 --> 02:48.234
Well, that sounds like
the usual phony cover-up.

02:48.234 --> 02:50.737
No, it's true.

02:50.737 --> 02:52.238
I was the agent.

02:52.739 --> 02:55.241
But there wasn't any spying.

02:55.241 --> 02:56.242
I was his friend.

02:56.242 --> 02:57.744
I was helping him
move some letters

02:57.744 --> 03:00.246
from political prisoners
to relatives,

03:00.246 --> 03:01.748
friends outside
of Russia.

03:01.748 --> 03:05.251
Somehow we slipped and...
they caught him.

03:05.251 --> 03:07.754
Pete, you can't blame
yourself for that.

03:07.754 --> 03:09.255
The hell I can't!

03:09.255 --> 03:10.757
Alex is dead.

03:10.757 --> 03:11.758
And now I've learned

03:11.758 --> 03:13.760
they're gonna arrest
his daughter, too, Marya.

03:13.760 --> 03:15.261
So you came to Russia
to get her out.

03:15.261 --> 03:16.262
Well, that's great, Pete.

03:16.262 --> 03:18.264
How do we operate?

03:18.264 --> 03:20.266
Mac, this is personal,
all right?

03:20.266 --> 03:21.768
First person singular.

03:21.768 --> 03:22.769
Just me.

03:22.769 --> 03:24.771
I'm not gonna jeopardize
anyone else in this.

03:24.771 --> 03:25.772
Hey, hold it.

03:25.772 --> 03:28.775
I'm here. I traveled
10,000 miles to be here.

03:28.775 --> 03:31.277
Now, like it or not,
you've got me.

03:33.279 --> 03:35.281
(chuckling)

03:35.281 --> 03:37.283
Okay.

03:37.283 --> 03:38.785
But she's gonna be
a little nervous

03:38.785 --> 03:40.787
about anyone arriving here.

03:40.787 --> 03:42.288
Let me go in alone,
all right?

03:42.288 --> 03:43.289
You just wait here.

03:43.289 --> 03:44.791
Okay.

03:44.791 --> 03:45.792
All right?

03:45.792 --> 03:46.793
Yeah.

03:47.293 --> 03:48.294
Okay?

03:48.294 --> 03:49.295
Okay.

03:52.298 --> 03:54.801
Okay.

04:26.833 --> 04:28.334
(knocking on door)

04:32.338 --> 04:33.840
Peter!

04:33.840 --> 04:34.841
Marya.

04:36.843 --> 04:38.344
Oh, Peter!

04:38.344 --> 04:40.847
God in heaven,
are you crazy
coming here?

04:40.847 --> 04:41.848
Don't you know?

04:41.848 --> 04:42.849
Yes, I do.

04:43.349 --> 04:44.350
Come in.

04:51.357 --> 04:57.864
Marya, I... I can't tell
you how truly sorry I am.

04:57.864 --> 05:01.367
Ah... I have no time
for weakness.

05:03.369 --> 05:05.371
The police, in their
infinite sensitivity,

05:05.371 --> 05:07.373
have ordered me out.

05:17.884 --> 05:21.387
Peter, an American
doesn't simply drop in

05:21.387 --> 05:22.889
in the middle of Russia.

05:22.889 --> 05:27.393
Marya, I have come
to take you out of here.

05:27.393 --> 05:28.394
No!

05:28.394 --> 05:29.896
Before you are arrested.

05:32.398 --> 05:33.900
(car approaches)

05:41.908 --> 05:46.412
MacGYVER:
A car like that's
gotta be the secret police.

05:48.915 --> 05:51.417
Three men in a black car.

06:01.427 --> 06:03.429
(knock on door)

06:03.429 --> 06:05.431
MAN:
Marya Alexandrovna
Karsova!

06:07.433 --> 06:09.936
Yes?

06:09.936 --> 06:11.938
You are requested to accompany
us to police headquarters.

06:11.938 --> 06:13.439
There are some questions.

06:13.439 --> 06:15.942
And the answer is she is guilty
and will be sent to the Gulag.

06:15.942 --> 06:16.943
No!

06:16.943 --> 06:18.444
MAN:
Marya Alexandrovna,

06:18.444 --> 06:19.946
I am only a policeman.

06:19.946 --> 06:22.448
Then find yourself
an honest trade.

06:22.448 --> 06:23.449
I am not coming.

06:24.450 --> 06:27.453
(screaming)

06:42.468 --> 06:44.470
Hi, Pete!
Any ideas?

06:44.470 --> 06:45.972
The boats, Pete.

06:45.972 --> 06:48.474
Oh, right.

06:48.474 --> 06:50.977
Stop them!

07:06.993 --> 07:08.995
(backfires)

07:08.995 --> 07:11.497
(engine starting)

07:11.497 --> 07:14.500
(backfires)

07:14.500 --> 07:16.502
(coughing)

07:50.036 --> 07:54.540
All this fun, and you wanted
to leave me behind.

07:54.540 --> 07:56.542
Everybody makes mistakes.

08:12.558 --> 08:15.061
After them!

08:15.061 --> 08:16.562
Hang on!

08:53.099 --> 08:54.600
Not much chance
of their hitting us.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.602
MacGYVER:
Not unless they get lucky.

09:01.107 --> 09:02.608
We got to get 'em

09:02.608 --> 09:04.110
off our tail.

09:18.624 --> 09:20.626
Give me a hand, Pete.

09:20.626 --> 09:21.627
What are we doing?

09:22.128 --> 09:23.629
Wrecking this blanket.

09:51.157 --> 09:53.159
(gunshot)

10:15.181 --> 10:18.184
Going to build something
for them to run into.

10:18.184 --> 10:20.186
That boat's got a jet drive.

10:20.186 --> 10:22.188
PETE:
You going to jam their intake?

10:22.188 --> 10:23.689
MacGYVER:
You got it.

11:13.739 --> 11:15.241
(engine straining)

11:23.749 --> 11:25.251
Got 'em!

11:25.251 --> 11:27.253
Clear the boat!

11:46.272 --> 11:48.274
Well, all right.

11:48.774 --> 11:50.276
Nice driving.

11:50.276 --> 11:53.779
MacGyver, I am truly happy
to finally meet you.

11:53.779 --> 11:55.781
Marya Alexandrovna Karsov.

11:55.781 --> 11:57.283
Mac, I'm grateful.

11:57.283 --> 11:58.284
You bet.

11:58.284 --> 11:59.285
And I am...

11:59.285 --> 12:00.786
to both of you.

12:00.786 --> 12:05.791
Peter, you risked your life
coming here to help me.

12:05.791 --> 12:06.792
And you, MacGyver.

12:07.793 --> 12:09.295
Marya, what else could we do?

12:09.295 --> 12:10.796
When I learned that
Alex was dead, I...

12:10.796 --> 12:12.298
I rushed here
as soon as I could.

12:12.298 --> 12:14.300
No, no, no, Peter,
what you heard was a lie.

12:17.303 --> 12:18.804
My father isn't dead.

12:18.804 --> 12:20.806
What?

12:20.806 --> 12:23.809
He is being held secretly
in a state mental hospital.

12:23.809 --> 12:25.311
Well, wait a minute.

12:25.311 --> 12:27.313
Why this death notice then?

12:27.313 --> 12:30.316
Because he is known.

12:30.316 --> 12:31.817
Because he is loved.

12:31.817 --> 12:34.320
They announce his
death and wait.

12:34.320 --> 12:39.825
If there is not too much public
protest, then he will die.

12:41.827 --> 12:43.829
No. No, he will not.

12:43.829 --> 12:47.333
Listen, I'm just grateful
he's alive.

12:47.333 --> 12:49.335
And thank God
you are free.

12:49.335 --> 12:50.836
To leave Russia?

12:50.836 --> 12:53.339
I thank you, Peter,
but I am not going to escape.

12:53.339 --> 12:55.841
The hospital is
near Leningrad.

12:55.841 --> 12:57.343
I have friends there.

12:57.343 --> 12:59.345
I'm going to get my father out.

12:59.345 --> 13:02.848
No... we are.

13:02.848 --> 13:03.849
Hey...

13:03.849 --> 13:05.351
what about me?

13:05.351 --> 13:09.355
I've never been
to Leningrad before.

13:09.355 --> 13:11.357
I hear it's a real...

13:11.357 --> 13:13.859
party town.

13:22.868 --> 13:25.371
MacGYVER:
Listen, Marya, your
friends were real helpful.

13:25.371 --> 13:26.872
MARYA:
They are very loyal.

13:26.872 --> 13:28.374
And I'll do my part.

13:28.374 --> 13:30.376
THORNTON:
Well, we've now
got travel permits,

13:30.376 --> 13:32.878
identification papers
and medical certificates.

13:32.878 --> 13:33.879
MacGYVER:
That's great.

13:33.879 --> 13:36.382
So we'll just waltz right in.

13:38.384 --> 13:38.884
There it is.

13:44.390 --> 13:46.392
MacGYVER:
Kind of
impressive.

13:46.392 --> 13:47.893
Right in the middle
of nowhere.

13:47.893 --> 13:49.395
It's a psychiatric
hospital.

13:49.395 --> 13:50.396
It has to be
isolated.

13:50.396 --> 13:52.398
Are you certain
we can do this?

13:52.398 --> 13:53.399
Nope.

13:53.399 --> 13:54.900
(chuckles)

13:54.900 --> 13:57.403
THORNTON:
Marya.

13:57.403 --> 13:59.905
Are you sure you can handle
your part of this plan?

13:59.905 --> 14:01.407
My part is simple.

14:01.407 --> 14:03.909
They take advantage of cheap
labor from the village.

14:03.909 --> 14:08.914
But yours, MacGyver,
is... it's a bit mad.

14:08.914 --> 14:11.417
Yeah...

14:11.417 --> 14:12.418
that's the idea.

14:12.418 --> 14:13.919
Let's go, Mac.

14:13.919 --> 14:15.421
Good luck.

14:30.436 --> 14:31.437
WOMAN:
This is highly irregular.

14:31.437 --> 14:34.440
I was not even told you
were coming, Doctor...

14:34.440 --> 14:35.441
THORNTON:
Torin.

14:35.441 --> 14:37.443
I'm no happier
than you are, Doctor.

14:37.443 --> 14:40.946
I'm required to stay here
for a week of observation.

14:40.946 --> 14:43.449
Although there doesn't
seem to be much question.

14:43.449 --> 14:45.451
WOMAN:
Is he really
schizophrenic,

14:45.951 --> 14:47.453
or is he
political?

14:47.453 --> 14:48.454
He's ill.

14:48.454 --> 14:49.955
Why do
you ask?

14:49.955 --> 14:52.958
There are...
different modes of treatment.

14:52.958 --> 14:54.960
WOMAN:
Dr. Suvarin
specializes

14:54.960 --> 14:55.961
in political
patients.

14:55.961 --> 14:58.464
I myself
do not enjoy

14:58.464 --> 15:00.466
acting as an agent

15:00.966 --> 15:02.468
of the Internal
Security.

15:02.468 --> 15:04.970
We carry out an important duty.

15:04.970 --> 15:10.476
But I can see that he
is a simple, good fellow.

15:10.476 --> 15:12.478
He won't give
us trouble.

15:12.478 --> 15:14.480
THORNTON:
No, absolutely not.

15:14.480 --> 15:15.981
In fact,
I planned on putting him

15:15.981 --> 15:18.984
in a minimum security
observation ward.

15:18.984 --> 15:21.487
Doctor, you will
observe your patient,

15:21.487 --> 15:23.489
nothing less, nothing more.

15:23.489 --> 15:27.493
But he will be housed
and treated

15:27.993 --> 15:29.495
under
our rules.

15:29.495 --> 15:30.496
Thank you.

15:38.504 --> 15:39.505
Please.

15:48.514 --> 15:51.517
(strumming balalaika)

15:56.522 --> 16:00.025
Well, my friend,
welcome to Ward K.

16:00.025 --> 16:03.529
As long as you make an honest
effort, we'll get along.

16:03.529 --> 16:05.030
(chuckling)

16:05.030 --> 16:08.534
He means take your pills,
do as you're told.

16:08.534 --> 16:11.036
It keeps everything
under control.

16:11.036 --> 16:15.040
Better to eat flesh
and drink blood.

16:15.040 --> 16:17.042
Mm-hmm.
This is Lopat.

16:17.042 --> 16:18.544
Just give him
plenty of room,

16:18.544 --> 16:20.045
especially
at night.

16:20.045 --> 16:21.547
(chuckles)

16:21.547 --> 16:24.550
So, if you belong here,
it's that side of the ward.

16:24.550 --> 16:26.552
If you're political, it's here.

16:26.552 --> 16:27.553
Still having illusions

16:28.053 --> 16:30.055
that you're a political
prisoner, Dimitri?

16:30.055 --> 16:32.558
That's what I am, you bedbug.

16:32.558 --> 16:35.561
Please don't provoke me,
Dimitri.

16:35.561 --> 16:39.565
Or I would be forced
to quiet you down...

16:39.565 --> 16:41.567
again.

16:41.567 --> 16:44.570
No, this is just talk.

16:44.570 --> 16:49.074
(blubbering lips)

16:49.575 --> 16:52.578
(sniffing)

16:58.584 --> 17:00.586
I belong here.

17:02.588 --> 17:04.589
I really do.

17:06.592 --> 17:07.593
Yes.

17:07.593 --> 17:09.094
What about you, sir?

17:09.094 --> 17:10.095
Do you
belong here?

17:12.097 --> 17:15.099
I am political.

17:15.099 --> 17:19.104
But I also drink...
blood.

17:22.107 --> 17:25.109
MAN:
Do you play?

17:25.109 --> 17:27.112
I play both of you
at same time.

17:27.112 --> 17:28.614
I play all of you.

17:28.614 --> 17:30.616
You're getting over-excited.

17:34.620 --> 17:36.121
No. No.

17:36.121 --> 17:37.623
Don't do it.

17:37.623 --> 17:39.124
We must learn control.

17:41.627 --> 17:45.631
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to take this for a little while.

17:45.631 --> 17:46.632
Please, no.

17:46.632 --> 17:47.633
Please, yes!

17:48.133 --> 17:49.635
For God's sake, let him have it!

17:49.635 --> 17:53.138
We all must learn
to live together,

17:53.138 --> 17:54.139
don't we?

17:57.643 --> 17:59.144
Yes!

17:59.144 --> 18:00.646
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

18:00.646 --> 18:02.147
You're right!
You're right! You're right!

18:02.147 --> 18:03.148
(continues
shouting)

18:03.148 --> 18:04.650
Emergency!
Quickly!

18:04.650 --> 18:07.152
Yes, yes, yes,
you are right!

18:07.152 --> 18:09.154
We must do what we must do!

18:09.154 --> 18:10.155
We must live together

18:10.155 --> 18:11.657
and we must
learn

18:11.657 --> 18:14.660
to play together
and be what we must be!

18:14.660 --> 18:15.661
You're right!

18:15.661 --> 18:16.662
(laughs
maniacally)

18:16.662 --> 18:18.163
Thank you, my friend.

18:18.163 --> 18:20.165
(shouts)

18:20.165 --> 18:21.667
He has helped me.
I have a new friend here!

18:22.668 --> 18:23.669
That's right.
Thank you!

18:23.669 --> 18:25.170
Thank you!
Thank you! Thank you!

18:25.170 --> 18:26.672
Oh, what's this!
Oh, sorry, I quit!

18:26.672 --> 18:28.173
I quit! I quit!
I quit!

18:28.173 --> 18:29.174
(grunting)

18:29.174 --> 18:33.178
(groans)

18:48.193 --> 18:50.195
The patients eat in here
in small groups.

18:50.195 --> 18:51.697
Oh.

18:51.697 --> 18:53.198
And the, uh,
politicals?

18:53.198 --> 18:54.700
With the others.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.201
Medication in the food?

18:56.201 --> 18:57.703
No.

18:57.703 --> 19:00.205
I strongly disapprove of
drugs instead of treatment.

19:00.205 --> 19:02.207
Well, how do you control
the drug dispensing?

19:02.207 --> 19:04.710
Mild tranquilizers
are kept in the wards

19:04.710 --> 19:07.212
and the stronger drugs
are kept locked up

19:07.212 --> 19:08.714
in my office.

19:08.714 --> 19:10.716
Well, you're very wise
to be so careful, Natalya.

19:10.716 --> 19:12.217
MAN:
Dr. Torin.

19:12.217 --> 19:14.219
Your patient
became violent.

19:14.219 --> 19:15.721
What? Where?

19:16.221 --> 19:17.723
Oh, what do you mean?

19:17.723 --> 19:19.224
What have you done to him?

19:19.224 --> 19:21.226
( chuckling )

19:21.226 --> 19:22.728
I'm not laughing.

19:22.728 --> 19:23.729
Big of you.

19:23.729 --> 19:25.230
(chuckles)

19:25.230 --> 19:27.232
But it's not easy.

19:27.232 --> 19:29.234
You know, with
the flip of a coin,

19:29.234 --> 19:31.236
this could have
been you in here.

19:31.236 --> 19:33.238
Will you just get me out?

19:33.238 --> 19:36.742
My head hurts and my body's
about to turn numb.

19:36.742 --> 19:38.744
All right,
just stay cool.

19:44.249 --> 19:46.752
I've located the, uh,
psychotropic drugs.

19:46.752 --> 19:48.253
What about Karsov?

19:48.253 --> 19:51.757
There are three politicals
in the ward along with me.

19:51.757 --> 19:54.760
They ought to know
where he is...

19:54.760 --> 19:56.762
if I can get
them to talk.

19:56.762 --> 19:59.264
We're rolling, Pete.

19:59.264 --> 20:00.265
Yeah.

20:00.265 --> 20:03.769
Uh, there is one hitch.

20:03.769 --> 20:04.770
What?

20:04.770 --> 20:07.272
I only brought in one
set of lock picks.

20:07.272 --> 20:08.273
What?

20:08.273 --> 20:10.776
Well, I don't know if I can
get them back to you

20:10.776 --> 20:11.777
after I open the drug cabinet.

20:11.777 --> 20:13.278
Timing, Pete.

20:13.278 --> 20:13.779
Yes.

20:13.779 --> 20:15.781
All you've got to do

20:15.781 --> 20:17.282
is break into a cheese box.

20:17.282 --> 20:18.784
I've got to break into a cell.

20:18.784 --> 20:21.286
Change the timing?

20:21.286 --> 20:22.788
Remember Belgrade?

20:22.788 --> 20:25.290
Mm, don't change the timing.

20:25.290 --> 20:26.792
Right.

20:26.792 --> 20:28.794
Look, I'll get my own set
of lock picks,

20:28.794 --> 20:29.795
all right?

20:29.795 --> 20:30.796
Good. Let's go.

20:30.796 --> 20:32.297
Pete.

20:32.297 --> 20:34.299
Oh.

20:46.311 --> 20:49.314
MacGYVER:
I'm here because of
a man named Karsov.

20:49.314 --> 20:52.818
Alexander Ivanovich Karsov.

20:52.818 --> 20:55.320
Never heard of him.

20:55.320 --> 20:57.823
Dimitri, please.

20:57.823 --> 20:59.324
I have to make contact.

20:59.324 --> 21:00.325
How?

21:00.325 --> 21:02.327
By flying out of the window?

21:02.327 --> 21:04.329
Or melting through the walls?

21:04.329 --> 21:06.331
MacGYVER:
We have a plan.

21:06.331 --> 21:07.833
Just tell me where he is.

21:07.833 --> 21:09.334
He is in

21:09.334 --> 21:10.335
Ward Zero.

21:10.335 --> 21:13.839
Knight to Queen's
Bishop Four.

21:13.839 --> 21:15.841
That's the move
I would make.

21:15.841 --> 21:18.343
But I can't.

21:18.343 --> 21:20.846
I can't.

21:31.356 --> 21:32.357
Ward Zero?

21:32.357 --> 21:34.359
Who are you?

21:34.359 --> 21:36.361
I'm here with Marya Karsova.

21:36.361 --> 21:39.865
We were given help
and papers in Leningrad.

21:39.865 --> 21:41.867
By Andrei Varsin.

21:41.867 --> 21:43.869
Any good police spy
might know the names.

21:43.869 --> 21:45.871
Knight to Queen's Bishop Four.

21:45.871 --> 21:46.872
But he wouldn't take a beating

21:46.872 --> 21:49.875
just to save
a poor fool's chess set.

21:51.376 --> 21:54.379
Ward Zero is just above us.

21:54.379 --> 21:57.382
But it's supposed to be empty.

21:57.382 --> 21:58.884
Oh, he is in Ward Zero.

21:58.884 --> 22:00.886
I saw.

22:00.886 --> 22:04.890
I remembered his work
on differential topology.

22:04.890 --> 22:06.391
Very sound.

22:06.391 --> 22:08.393
How will you get out of here?

22:14.399 --> 22:16.401
I'll just have
to get a set of keys.

22:16.401 --> 22:17.402
Excuse me.

22:37.923 --> 22:41.426
Every lightbulb
has tungsten filaments,

22:41.426 --> 22:45.931
two pieces of spring steel,
right size, right shape.

23:02.447 --> 23:04.950
Let there be light.

23:04.950 --> 23:07.452
It's the first
corridor on your left

23:07.452 --> 23:09.454
and then upstairs.

23:09.454 --> 23:10.455
I'll arrange
a diversion.

23:10.455 --> 23:12.457
Good luck.

23:12.457 --> 23:13.959
Thank you.

23:13.959 --> 23:15.961
A noisy diversion.

23:20.966 --> 23:22.467
Gentlemen...

23:24.469 --> 23:26.972
I'm going to need
your help.

23:29.474 --> 23:30.976
MAN:
I will
check on it.

23:38.483 --> 23:40.485
MacGYVER:
Ward Zero...

23:40.485 --> 23:45.991
with one problem.

24:59.064 --> 25:03.568
Caulking compound mixed with
the proper hardening agent

25:03.568 --> 25:08.073
makes a unique version
of Russian crazy glue.

25:08.073 --> 25:14.079
If I get out of this, I'll be
sure to mail them the recipe.

26:02.627 --> 26:04.629
What is this?

26:08.633 --> 26:13.638
(grunting)

26:36.661 --> 26:38.163
(grunting)

26:39.164 --> 26:40.665
(grunting)

26:40.665 --> 26:42.167
What are you doing?!

26:47.672 --> 26:50.175
Help! Security!

26:50.175 --> 26:52.677
(alarm bell blaring)

26:52.677 --> 26:55.180
(both grunting and yelling)

26:58.683 --> 27:01.686
Friend. Fun! Fun! Fun!

27:01.686 --> 27:02.687
Don't hurt him.

27:02.687 --> 27:06.191
And if anyone else comes,
keep them out of here.

27:06.191 --> 27:07.692
VOICE ON P.A.:
Secure all wards!

27:07.692 --> 27:08.693
Secure all wards!

27:08.693 --> 27:10.195
Guards to Ward Zero at once!

27:10.195 --> 27:11.696
(alarm continues ringing)

27:11.696 --> 27:13.198
Attention! Attention!

27:13.198 --> 27:15.700
Additional disturbance
in Ward K.

27:17.702 --> 27:20.205
Attention, Ward K!

27:20.205 --> 27:23.708
Sergeant Borov, east wing
security desk at once.

27:23.708 --> 27:26.711
Sergeant Borov,
east wing security desk.

27:26.711 --> 27:29.214
(whispering):
Karsov?

27:30.715 --> 27:32.217
Alexander Karsov?

27:32.217 --> 27:34.219
Who are you?

27:34.219 --> 27:36.721
Your daughter Marya
sent me.

27:41.726 --> 27:44.229
I'll have you out of here
in a second.

27:45.730 --> 27:49.234
(laughing, yelling
and whooping)

27:49.234 --> 27:50.235
VOICE ON P.A.:
Emergency!

27:50.735 --> 27:52.237
Attendants to Ward Zero at once!

27:52.237 --> 27:53.738
(alarm bell continues)

27:57.242 --> 28:00.245
I am the only patient
in this section.

28:00.245 --> 28:03.748
They will certainly
search this room,

28:03.748 --> 28:05.250
and then they find you.

28:14.359 --> 28:16.361
(banging)

28:19.364 --> 28:21.366
VOICE ON P.A.:
Ward Zero security, report!

28:21.366 --> 28:23.368
We're going
to get you out of here.

28:23.368 --> 28:24.369
KARSOV:
"We"?

28:24.369 --> 28:26.371
Please trust me, sir.

28:35.380 --> 28:37.382
(groaning)

28:42.387 --> 28:45.890
(attendant groaning)

28:45.890 --> 28:47.892
(groaning continues)

28:51.396 --> 28:53.898
(groaning)

29:00.405 --> 29:02.407
(yelling)

29:14.419 --> 29:16.421
VOICE ON P.A.:
This is Sergeant Borov!

29:16.421 --> 29:18.423
All guard posts on the left!

29:18.923 --> 29:21.426
Patients are loose
in the east wing.

29:21.426 --> 29:22.927
Secure all exits.

29:48.453 --> 29:50.955
VOICE ON P.A.:
Attention! Attention!

29:50.955 --> 29:52.457
Ward K has been secured.

29:52.457 --> 29:54.959
Repeat, Ward K has been secured.

29:54.959 --> 29:56.961
All guards and attendants
report back

29:56.961 --> 29:59.464
to your stations at once.

30:00.465 --> 30:01.966
(keys jangling)

30:29.494 --> 30:32.497
You think
he's a hero then, yes?

30:32.497 --> 30:33.998
No, leave it alone.

30:33.998 --> 30:35.500
I want him restrained.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.001
No, Suvarin, no!

30:37.001 --> 30:40.004
Dr. Suvarin,
please.

30:40.004 --> 30:42.006
DIMITRI:
Doctor. All right,

30:42.006 --> 30:43.508
doctor, you'll
cripple him.

30:43.508 --> 30:46.010
Prolonged loss
of blood circulation

30:46.010 --> 30:48.513
will frequently result
in permanent trauma

30:48.513 --> 30:50.515
inflicted upon muscle tissue,

30:50.515 --> 30:53.017
and may also entail blockage
to kidneys, and...

30:53.017 --> 30:56.020
I didn't know
you had medical training.

30:56.020 --> 31:00.024
I... remember things.

31:00.024 --> 31:02.527
Oh. But then
you forget again, yes?

31:02.527 --> 31:06.030
I? Yes.

31:06.030 --> 31:10.034
Yes. Maybe I should burn
that chess set there

31:10.034 --> 31:13.037
so you can think
about other things.

31:27.051 --> 31:28.553
SUVARIN:
Do not touch

31:29.053 --> 31:31.055
this chess board until
I give you permission.

31:33.558 --> 31:35.560
DIMITRI:
Sadist.

31:43.568 --> 31:47.071
We'll speak about that
again later.

31:47.071 --> 31:50.575
But for now,
clean up this mess!

31:54.579 --> 31:56.581
It's all right.

31:56.581 --> 31:58.583
He didn't use the needle.

32:10.595 --> 32:12.597
It's clear.

32:16.601 --> 32:18.102
This way, sir.

32:45.630 --> 32:47.632
Dr. Torin.

33:25.670 --> 33:27.672
Where in the hell
have you been?

33:27.672 --> 33:31.175
Outside. For a stroll.

33:31.175 --> 33:33.177
What?

33:33.177 --> 33:34.679
The moonlight.

33:34.679 --> 33:37.181
It's very important to me.

33:37.181 --> 33:39.684
Come, I'll show you
the open gate.

33:50.194 --> 33:53.197
Shouldn't there be
better security, comrade?

33:53.197 --> 33:55.199
There are some
disturbed people here.

33:55.199 --> 33:58.202
BORIS:
Just show me
the open gate.

33:58.202 --> 33:59.203
I can't see.

33:59.203 --> 34:02.206
MacGYVER:
Comrade, it is night.

34:02.206 --> 34:06.210
Wolves and owls can see.

34:06.210 --> 34:09.213
Men and flowers
must wait for the sun.

34:09.213 --> 34:10.715
You've been here

34:10.715 --> 34:12.717
too long, comrade.

34:12.717 --> 34:14.719
Go outside
and look for yourself

34:14.719 --> 34:16.721
if you don't
believe me.

34:16.721 --> 34:17.722
Can I get some medicine,
please?

34:17.722 --> 34:19.223
I can't sleep.

34:19.223 --> 34:21.225
All right, all right.

34:21.225 --> 34:24.228
But no more noise.

34:24.228 --> 34:26.230
Oh, of course,
of course.

34:26.230 --> 34:27.732
Crazy.

34:27.732 --> 34:31.735
Indeed.
(laughing)

34:35.239 --> 34:37.241
Thank you.

34:42.746 --> 34:44.248
We made it.

34:44.248 --> 34:48.753
(chuckling):
At some risk to my heart.

34:49.253 --> 34:51.255
Now... who are you?

34:51.755 --> 34:52.757
Just a volunteer.

34:52.757 --> 34:56.260
Along with Peter Thornton
and your daughter.

34:56.260 --> 34:57.762
Peter is here?

34:59.263 --> 35:00.765
Why?

35:00.765 --> 35:02.767
Friendship.

35:07.772 --> 35:11.275
I don't want to make trouble
for people.

35:11.275 --> 35:15.279
And Marya--
I pleaded with her to leave.

35:15.279 --> 35:17.281
Yeah, well,
she's a little stubborn

35:17.281 --> 35:18.282
when it comes to you.

35:18.282 --> 35:20.785
Children.

35:20.785 --> 35:23.788
I am proud of her.

35:23.788 --> 35:28.793
And I worry--
trouble I may bring to her.

35:31.295 --> 35:32.797
What's the plan?

35:32.797 --> 35:34.799
Well, tonight
was phase one.

35:34.799 --> 35:37.301
Get you out of your cell
and leave them searching.

35:37.301 --> 35:41.305
And then phase two
has Marya in the village

35:41.305 --> 35:43.307
passing as a local girl.

35:43.307 --> 35:47.311
She's arranged to work
in the hospital dining room.

35:47.311 --> 35:50.314
When the security staff
is eating,

35:50.314 --> 35:52.817
she'll help us
take care of them.

35:52.817 --> 35:55.820
And tomorrow morning
is phase three.

35:55.820 --> 35:59.824
Pete will kick that off
in about five hours.

35:59.824 --> 36:01.826
And I wanted
to be a surgeon.

36:01.826 --> 36:04.328
But for a woman, you know,
it's very difficult.

36:06.330 --> 36:08.833
Suvarin, you'll give me
a heart attack yet.

36:09.333 --> 36:11.335
My apologies, Natalya Petrovich,

36:11.335 --> 36:15.339
but I have the precise
medication for your condition.

36:22.847 --> 36:25.349
This is a powerful
psychotropic drug.

36:25.349 --> 36:26.851
I don't understand.

36:26.851 --> 36:28.853
I'll explain.

36:28.853 --> 36:31.355
It is worth a lot of money
on the black market.

36:31.355 --> 36:34.859
And that is why you
and your coconspirator here

36:34.859 --> 36:36.360
stole it.

36:36.360 --> 36:39.864
Suvarin, have you finally
gone mad?

36:39.864 --> 36:42.366
Perhaps it's just a
little bit of paranoia.

36:42.366 --> 36:44.368
It's proof!

36:45.870 --> 36:48.372
I have already
telephoned Leningrad.

36:48.372 --> 36:49.373
(scoffs)

36:49.373 --> 36:50.875
You are both under house arrest.

36:50.875 --> 36:53.377
You will see no one,
speak to no one.

36:53.377 --> 36:54.879
You are prisoners.

36:55.880 --> 36:58.382
(quiet chuckling)

37:11.395 --> 37:12.897
Good morning.

37:12.897 --> 37:15.399
The Labor Office
in the village assigned me...

37:15.399 --> 37:17.401
to you.

37:17.401 --> 37:18.402
To me?

37:18.402 --> 37:21.405
Oh yes,
well... yes.

37:21.405 --> 37:22.907
(clears throat)

37:22.907 --> 37:24.408
Yes!

37:24.408 --> 37:25.409
And?

37:25.409 --> 37:26.911
What?

37:26.911 --> 37:28.913
What are your orders?

37:28.913 --> 37:29.914
Orders!

37:29.914 --> 37:32.416
(laughs):
Of course.

37:32.416 --> 37:34.418
Knife, fork, spoon

37:34.418 --> 37:36.420
and napkin

37:36.420 --> 37:38.923
on this table only.

37:38.923 --> 37:39.924
O-Only this table?

37:39.924 --> 37:41.926
Yes, for the staff, you know.

37:42.426 --> 37:44.428
For doctors, nurses,

37:44.428 --> 37:45.429
security officers.

37:45.429 --> 37:47.932
So it is important
that it must be correct.

37:47.932 --> 37:49.433
Of course.

37:49.433 --> 37:51.435
When do they
eat breakfast?

37:51.435 --> 37:53.437
In, uh, 20 minutes!

37:53.437 --> 37:55.439
So quick, quick, quick, my girl!

38:10.454 --> 38:12.456
Good morning!

38:17.461 --> 38:19.964
When are we
getting out for
our exercise?

38:19.964 --> 38:21.465
Oh, you don't, Dimitri.

38:21.465 --> 38:22.466
Not until the patient

38:22.466 --> 38:24.468
that escaped last night
has been found.

38:24.468 --> 38:27.471
And the criminal plot
that I discovered

38:27.471 --> 38:31.475
in this hospital has been
fully resolved.

38:31.475 --> 38:32.476
The criminal plot?

38:32.476 --> 38:35.479
Yes, the theft of valuable drugs

38:35.479 --> 38:38.482
by Dr. Petrovich,
the new doctor.

38:38.482 --> 38:42.987
And I assume,
until proven otherwise,

38:42.987 --> 38:45.489
our new patient.

38:47.491 --> 38:49.493
(sighs)

38:51.495 --> 38:53.497
Good work, Suvarin.

38:53.497 --> 38:55.499
As it happens,

38:55.499 --> 38:58.502
I've been investigating
this drug ring for some time.

38:58.502 --> 39:00.004
I am K.G.B.,
and this is evidence...

39:00.004 --> 39:01.505
Stay where you are!

39:04.508 --> 39:07.511
I am sure the three of you

39:07.511 --> 39:09.513
will benefit greatly

39:09.513 --> 39:12.516
from chemical interrogation.

39:12.516 --> 39:14.518
(screams):
No!

39:15.519 --> 39:18.022
No!

39:19.023 --> 39:21.025
(pained groaning)

39:23.027 --> 39:25.029
(grunting)

39:28.532 --> 39:30.534
(grunting)

39:32.036 --> 39:34.538
(grunting)

39:34.538 --> 39:36.540
I know where
Dr. Petrovich is.

39:36.540 --> 39:38.542
I know where her office is.
MacGYVER:
Good, show me.

39:38.542 --> 39:40.544
Let's go!

39:40.544 --> 39:41.545
Come on.

39:42.046 --> 39:44.048
We know this plan.

39:44.048 --> 39:47.051
(Suvarin mumbling, muffled)

39:54.558 --> 39:56.060
Hi.

39:56.060 --> 39:57.061
Well, glad you
could make it.

39:57.061 --> 39:58.562
Thanks.
You are black market!

39:58.562 --> 39:59.563
No, we're just

39:59.563 --> 40:01.065
your basic
revolutionaries.

40:01.065 --> 40:02.066
Power to the people!

40:02.066 --> 40:03.067
You bet!

40:03.067 --> 40:05.069
Trust us, Natalya,
trust us.

40:07.071 --> 40:08.572
Come!

40:08.572 --> 40:10.574
Come quickly, quickly!

40:12.576 --> 40:15.079
Remember, I am mad!

40:15.079 --> 40:16.580
(low, indistinct chatter)

40:16.580 --> 40:18.582
Thank you.

40:28.092 --> 40:29.593
Thank goodness
you are here!

40:30.094 --> 40:32.096
Well, seems to be working.

40:32.096 --> 40:33.597
So far.

40:33.597 --> 40:34.598
Here's the medication.

40:34.598 --> 40:35.599
Now, it's all mixed.

40:35.599 --> 40:37.101
What do you think
you are doing, eh?

40:37.101 --> 40:39.103
Who are you?

40:39.103 --> 40:40.104
What are
you doing?

40:40.104 --> 40:41.605
What is
going on?

40:41.605 --> 40:43.107
Stop!

40:43.107 --> 40:44.608
We're
breaking out.

40:45.109 --> 40:46.110
Oh.

40:47.111 --> 40:48.612
Oh.

40:48.612 --> 40:50.614
We wouldn't like it
if you interfered.

40:50.614 --> 40:52.116
No, no, no.

40:52.116 --> 40:54.618
You can lock me
in the closet,

40:54.618 --> 40:56.620
or the supply room,

40:56.620 --> 40:58.122
or-or the cellar...

40:58.122 --> 40:59.123
The closet'll do

40:59.123 --> 41:00.624
just fine.

41:00.624 --> 41:02.126
Yes, of course.
Yes, yes...

41:02.126 --> 41:04.128
Sorry.

41:05.129 --> 41:06.630
This is a
sedative.

41:06.630 --> 41:08.632
It's a mild
psychotropic.

41:08.632 --> 41:10.634
They'll never
feel happier.

41:10.634 --> 41:13.137
Okay.

41:18.642 --> 41:20.644
(low, indistinct chatter)

41:20.644 --> 41:22.646
WOMAN:
I had talked
to him earlier
about it...

41:26.150 --> 41:27.651
What's that?

41:27.651 --> 41:29.153
More tea, sir.

41:29.153 --> 41:31.655
About time.

41:39.163 --> 41:42.166
Queen to Rook One.

41:43.167 --> 41:45.169
Yes.

41:47.171 --> 41:49.173
Oh, I will make
the move for you.

41:49.173 --> 41:50.174
(loud muffled mumbling)

41:50.174 --> 41:52.176
Yes, here. Just

41:52.176 --> 41:54.178
Knight.

41:54.178 --> 41:55.679
Clever move, yes?

41:55.679 --> 41:57.681
(muffled mumbling)

41:57.681 --> 41:59.683
Not so clever.

41:59.683 --> 42:01.685
Bishop.

42:01.685 --> 42:03.187
Sorry.

42:03.187 --> 42:04.188
(groans)

42:04.188 --> 42:05.189
Oh.

42:05.189 --> 42:06.190
(clicking tongue)

42:06.190 --> 42:08.692
Incidentally, you are in check.

42:09.193 --> 42:10.194
You must
move King.

42:10.194 --> 42:12.196
I'll move King for you.

42:14.198 --> 42:15.199
You're welcome.

42:15.199 --> 42:16.700
(mumbling)

42:16.700 --> 42:18.202
You play very well.

42:18.202 --> 42:19.703
(excited mumbling)

42:19.703 --> 42:22.206
(low, indistinct chatter)

42:26.210 --> 42:27.711
Marya! Marya!

42:27.711 --> 42:29.713
Papa!
KARSOV:
Oh!

42:29.713 --> 42:31.715
Oh, Papa. Oh.

42:31.715 --> 42:33.217
Ah!

42:33.217 --> 42:34.718
Papa, thank God
you're all right.

42:34.718 --> 42:36.720
Oh, a
miracle!

42:36.720 --> 42:38.222
You're a patient!

42:38.222 --> 42:40.224
No, wewere
patients.

42:40.224 --> 42:42.226
What?
MacGYVER:
Well, we figure it's about

42:42.226 --> 42:43.227
time for the patients

42:43.227 --> 42:45.229
to take over the asylum,
old pal.

42:45.229 --> 42:46.230
(Thornton laughs)

42:46.230 --> 42:48.232
Natalya, we are leaving now.

42:48.232 --> 42:49.233
We're gonna go.

42:49.233 --> 42:51.235
And you can come with us
if you want.

42:51.235 --> 42:52.736
You'll be able
to practice medicine

42:52.736 --> 42:54.238
the way you want to.
Join us.

42:54.238 --> 42:56.740
I cannot
stay here.

42:56.740 --> 42:58.242
I-I do not know
what I will do,

42:58.242 --> 42:59.743
but I-I will
help you.

42:59.743 --> 43:00.744
Ah.
How about that, Pete?

43:00.744 --> 43:02.246
All right!

43:02.246 --> 43:03.747
I must get you
some passes.

43:03.747 --> 43:05.749
We-We must hurry!

43:07.251 --> 43:08.252
Good luck!

43:08.252 --> 43:10.254
(low indistinct chatter)

43:12.256 --> 43:13.757
(laughter in the background)

43:13.757 --> 43:15.259
MAN:
Oh, yes!

43:16.760 --> 43:18.262
...Your papers, sir.

43:18.262 --> 43:20.264
Oh, right.

43:22.266 --> 43:23.267
(grunting)

43:23.267 --> 43:25.269
Let's go, Pete.

43:25.769 --> 43:26.770
MAN:
Hurry, quickly!

43:26.770 --> 43:28.272
WOMAN:
Hurry!

43:28.272 --> 43:30.774
This way.

43:31.275 --> 43:32.276
MAN:
Freedom!

43:32.776 --> 43:35.779
Gwen...
this way,
this way...

43:35.779 --> 43:38.282
It's not far, Alex.

43:38.282 --> 43:40.784
We'll be across
the Finnish border in two hours.

43:40.784 --> 43:42.286
Oh, no, no, Peter, no.

43:42.286 --> 43:43.787
I don't go with you.

43:43.787 --> 43:45.289
No, they-they...

43:45.289 --> 43:47.291
They have
made me too...

43:47.291 --> 43:48.792
too famous
now to kill.

43:48.792 --> 43:50.794
And now you give
me another chance,

43:50.794 --> 43:52.796
I will take it
to speak out.

43:52.796 --> 43:56.300
Alex, they've had you locked
in a straitjacket!

43:56.300 --> 43:58.802
That's the government, Peter.

43:58.802 --> 44:00.304
Not Russia.

44:00.304 --> 44:01.805
A government.

44:01.805 --> 44:03.307
Yeah.

44:03.307 --> 44:05.809
More people like you around...

44:08.312 --> 44:10.814
just about anything can happen.

44:10.814 --> 44:12.816
Anything.

44:12.816 --> 44:14.818
(bird singing)

44:36.840 --> 44:39.843
Well, the word is out.

44:39.843 --> 44:41.845
There should be a lot
of people here.

44:41.845 --> 44:43.847
Oh, thank you.

44:43.847 --> 44:44.848
Papa!

44:44.848 --> 44:46.850
No, Masha.

44:46.850 --> 44:48.352
We agreed.

44:48.352 --> 44:50.854
But if you can stay,
why can't I?

44:50.854 --> 44:53.357
If they take you,
then they have me.

44:53.357 --> 44:54.358
Hmm?

44:54.358 --> 44:55.859
Oh.

44:55.859 --> 44:58.362
Come, you are young.

44:58.362 --> 44:59.363
You will see America.

44:59.363 --> 45:01.365
You can be my voice there.

45:01.365 --> 45:04.368
And then, maybe,

45:04.368 --> 45:07.871
some better time, you
can come home again.

45:08.372 --> 45:09.373
Meanwhile,
we will work

45:09.373 --> 45:11.375
to make it
a better time.

45:12.876 --> 45:14.878
And what about you, Natalya?

45:14.878 --> 45:16.380
Are you sure?

45:16.380 --> 45:19.383
No, but hopeful.

45:19.383 --> 45:21.385
Because he
believes.

45:21.385 --> 45:22.886
That government
can change?

45:22.886 --> 45:23.887
Oh, yes.

45:23.887 --> 45:24.888
(laughs)

45:24.888 --> 45:26.390
This...

45:26.390 --> 45:27.891
This cannot.

45:29.893 --> 45:32.396
This land is-is
part of me.

45:32.396 --> 45:33.897
I am afraid I...

45:33.897 --> 45:35.899
I was not designed
for exile.

45:38.402 --> 45:41.905
I owe you so much.

45:41.905 --> 45:43.907
Also, you,

45:43.907 --> 45:45.409
MacGyver.

45:45.409 --> 45:48.412
Well, speaking
for Pete and myself,

45:48.912 --> 45:50.914
I think we've been paid in full.

45:52.916 --> 45:54.918
Papa!

46:11.935 --> 46:13.937
Alexander Karsov,
it's you!

46:13.937 --> 46:16.440
You're alive! Oh...

46:16.440 --> 46:17.441
Everyone, look!

46:17.441 --> 46:18.442
(loud, excited chatter)

46:18.442 --> 46:20.444
Oh, my... that's
really Karsov!

46:20.444 --> 46:22.446
MAN:
Karsov!
