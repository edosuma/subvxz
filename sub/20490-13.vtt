00:10.010 --> 00:11.611
Hey, you don't want
to get too close, huh?

00:11.646 --> 00:12.777
Hey. My ride.

00:12.812 --> 00:14.414
I'll do the driving, all right?

00:14.449 --> 00:15.981
Yeah, well, you know what?

00:16.015 --> 00:17.617
Speaking of your "ride", do
you think you could have picked

00:17.652 --> 00:18.818
anything a little
more conspicuous?

00:19.219 --> 00:20.785
Come on, if somebody's
going to jack that prison truck,

00:20.820 --> 00:22.822
the last they they're going
to be expecting the backup to be

00:22.857 --> 00:24.024
driving is a
vintage cutlass, hm?

00:24.424 --> 00:26.026
You know, that's so dumb
it might actually be clever.

00:26.426 --> 00:28.428
I knew you'd
eventually come around.

00:28.463 --> 00:30.030
<laughs>

00:34.834 --> 00:38.038
hey, maddox, i hear that
they got a special place for you

00:38.438 --> 00:40.805
fixed up in the hole.

00:40.840 --> 00:44.444
Down so deep you gotta
look up to see bottom.

00:44.844 --> 00:47.612
Think you're so cool, huh?

00:47.647 --> 00:50.850
You got everybody
shakin' in their boots.

00:51.251 --> 00:53.653
Well, me, i don't
see what the big deal is.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:04.464 --> 01:06.031
Nice driving.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.068
Brennan, i don't
like the look of that.

01:16.876 --> 01:18.843
What are you smilin' at?

01:18.878 --> 01:20.880
I asked you
a question, tough guy.

01:21.281 --> 01:23.283
Huh? What's so funny?

01:23.683 --> 01:25.650
It's a visual joke.

01:25.685 --> 01:29.289
Look out the back window.

01:34.894 --> 01:36.896
Agghhh!

02:01.721 --> 02:04.124
That's more like it.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.731
You know, this guy's
getting on my nerves.

02:11.766 --> 02:12.932
Should we kick some ass?

02:12.967 --> 02:15.335
Let's do it.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.758
Friends, i don't
know who you are,

02:38.793 --> 02:41.361
but you just took
on the wrong fight.

02:42.962 --> 02:45.365
Ugh!

02:48.568 --> 02:50.135
Hey, are you okay?

02:50.170 --> 02:52.372
Yeah, don't worry about me.

02:52.407 --> 02:54.574
We gotta take this guy out.

02:58.978 --> 03:00.580
Who was that guy?

03:00.615 --> 03:02.147
I don't know.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.584
Another couple
of inches he would've been
the guy that killed me.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.389
I am adam kane.

03:09.789 --> 03:12.992
I was a pioneer
of genetic research,

03:13.027 --> 03:16.161
manipulating dna
to save human lives.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.998
But in many their
genes unexpectedly mutated.

03:19.399 --> 03:22.602
They developed
super-human abilities.

03:50.630 --> 03:53.032
Together with four of the most
powerful i fight to protect a

03:53.433 --> 03:55.835
world that doesn't
even know we exist.

03:59.038 --> 04:01.841
We are... mutant x.

04:07.213 --> 04:09.215
Well, believe it or not,
this could've been a lot worse.

04:09.250 --> 04:10.782
Ow!

04:10.817 --> 04:13.184
Yeah, easy for you to say.

04:13.219 --> 04:14.420
Well, whatever he hit you with,

04:14.821 --> 04:16.022
it cauterized the
wound as it went through.

04:16.057 --> 04:18.423
You know, some
sort of energy source,

04:18.459 --> 04:21.192
like a concentrated heat.

04:21.226 --> 04:23.630
Well, why didn't
you tell me the person we
were covering was a mutant?

04:23.665 --> 04:25.196
I didn't know.

04:25.231 --> 04:27.198
I thought it
was a simple transfer.

04:27.233 --> 04:29.636
Okay, so the
person that brought us in
was probably setting us up.

04:29.671 --> 04:32.003
No. I don't think so.

04:32.038 --> 04:35.241
Least i don't want to
believe that that's the case.

04:35.642 --> 04:37.208
Okay. You know what?

04:37.243 --> 04:38.810
You go ahead and
think good thoughts.

04:38.845 --> 04:40.847
See, i'm having a hard
time doing that considering

04:40.882 --> 04:42.849
i'm the one with
a hole in his arm.

04:43.249 --> 04:44.816
I just don't want
to jump to conclusions.

04:44.851 --> 04:47.654
You know, i was asked to
get involved in this job because

04:47.689 --> 04:49.621
your special abilities
were required to handle it.

04:49.656 --> 04:52.458
And beyond that, my source
required secrecy for certain

04:52.493 --> 04:54.025
aspects of the mission.

04:54.060 --> 04:56.863
Okay, so someone else's need for
secrecy almost got me killed?

04:57.263 --> 04:58.865
Weli... and there are
levels to all this.

04:59.265 --> 05:00.867
I don't even know if my
source knew who was in the van.

05:00.902 --> 05:02.033
Okay, fine.

05:02.068 --> 05:03.670
So now we know: Some
psychotic mutant killer.

05:03.705 --> 05:04.871
You know, adam,

05:05.271 --> 05:06.472
i feel like i'm owed an
explanation for this, don't you?

05:06.873 --> 05:08.474
Well, i didn't say i don't think
we're owed an explanation -

05:08.509 --> 05:09.676
i intend to get one.

05:10.076 --> 05:11.678
Yeah, which you may not be able
to share with me considering

05:11.713 --> 05:13.279
it's a "need to know".

05:13.680 --> 05:14.881
I mean,

05:15.281 --> 05:16.883
is it
just me or is there something
wrong with this picture?

05:17.283 --> 05:18.885
Okay, so what is
it you're trying to say?

05:19.285 --> 05:21.653
Adam, when we
go into a situation,

05:21.688 --> 05:23.690
we deserve to have
some knowledge of the risk.

05:24.090 --> 05:25.692
Especially if you're
the one that's sending us in,

05:25.727 --> 05:27.293
then you have a
responsibility to tell us.

05:27.694 --> 05:29.696
Don't lecture me
about my responsibilities.

05:29.731 --> 05:30.862
Okay?

05:30.897 --> 05:32.463
I'm sorry you got hurt.

05:32.498 --> 05:34.500
I intend to find out why a
certain information was withheld

05:34.901 --> 05:37.904
from us, but there are decisions
that i make and will continue

05:37.939 --> 05:40.907
to make that are made for
my reasons and at my discretion.

05:40.942 --> 05:42.508
Okay, so, "do
it because i said so. "

05:42.543 --> 05:44.075
Uh, you know what?

05:44.110 --> 05:46.112
That... that sounds an
awful lot like the reasoning

05:46.147 --> 05:49.315
my step-father used to use.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.123
Check this out.

05:57.158 --> 05:59.691
What did you find?

05:59.726 --> 06:02.493
I searched both ours and
genomex's mutant databases and

06:02.528 --> 06:04.530
there is nothing in the record
of anybody having the kind of

06:04.931 --> 06:06.933
powers that the guy
in the prison truck had.

06:06.968 --> 06:08.352
Can you stop that?

06:08.387 --> 06:09.701
Okay... but...

06:09.736 --> 06:11.703
there is a whole other
section of files that documents

06:11.738 --> 06:15.341
genomex's treatment
of people who showed
no sign of mutation at all.

06:15.376 --> 06:16.943
And that's where i got lucky.

06:18.945 --> 06:20.511
His name is nick maddox.

06:20.546 --> 06:22.148
He was sent to genomex
for six months ten years ago.

06:22.548 --> 06:23.750
He was sick?

06:24.150 --> 06:26.152
He was supposed to be tested
for a hereditary liver problem.

06:26.552 --> 06:28.554
But he was never scheduled for
a biopsy and there's not even

06:28.589 --> 06:30.556
a suggestion of treatment
for that condition.

06:30.957 --> 06:32.959
So what is on
his record?
- Not much.

06:33.359 --> 06:36.963
Except that
he was assigned to section
77 for routine observation.

06:37.363 --> 06:39.766
There's nothing
routine about section 77.

06:40.166 --> 06:41.332
Hmm.

06:41.367 --> 06:43.369
And there's no way someone
would be held for six months of

06:43.404 --> 06:45.371
observation with
no record of treatment.

06:45.772 --> 06:46.938
Okay, does it say who...

06:46.973 --> 06:48.539
who paid for his
treatment at genomex?

06:48.574 --> 06:50.176
Maybe we can track
him down through his parents.

06:50.576 --> 06:52.178
That's the other thing.

06:52.578 --> 06:55.381
There's no record of
who paid for his treatment.

06:55.782 --> 06:59.385
Meaning it was someone
or some organization
with something to hide.

06:59.420 --> 07:02.205
Yeah. It also means that
he might not be the only one.

07:02.240 --> 07:04.991
There may be a whole slew
of mutants that genomex created

07:05.026 --> 07:06.592
that we know nothing about.

07:06.993 --> 07:08.995
Well, that's
a comforting thought.

07:09.030 --> 07:09.796
Hmm.

07:14.200 --> 07:15.801
What is it, adam?

07:15.836 --> 07:17.368
You know what it is.

07:17.403 --> 07:19.005
You must've heard
what happened i've heard.

07:19.040 --> 07:22.208
Other arrangements
are being made.

07:22.243 --> 07:23.775
It's not good enough.

07:23.810 --> 07:25.211
I want to know what's going on.

07:25.246 --> 07:26.612
You know better than to ask.

07:26.647 --> 07:28.214
I want to see you.

07:28.249 --> 07:31.017
No meetings.

07:31.417 --> 07:33.419
Yeah, but that
was before you almost got
one of my people killed.

07:33.820 --> 07:37.223
I'm sorry, adam,
your request is denied.

07:37.258 --> 07:40.626
You're not getting
away that easily.

07:59.445 --> 08:01.447
We could've been five hundred
miles away from here by now.

08:01.848 --> 08:03.449
Why are we doing this?

08:03.484 --> 08:05.051
Unfinished business.

08:05.451 --> 08:07.053
Yeah, well we got a bank
job waiting for us that's fresh

08:07.088 --> 08:08.654
business, paying business.

08:09.055 --> 08:11.022
We don't got time for this.

08:11.057 --> 08:16.262
There's always time for revenge.

08:29.475 --> 08:31.076
Can i help you?

08:31.111 --> 08:32.643
I want to see her.

08:32.678 --> 08:34.280
Now why don't you
save us both some trouble

08:34.315 --> 08:35.847
and just tell me where she is?

08:35.881 --> 08:37.482
I'm not sure who
you're talking about.

08:37.884 --> 08:39.485
But if you would
like an insurance quote,

08:39.520 --> 08:41.452
i could call an agent.

08:41.486 --> 08:43.855
Well, maybe i didn't
introduce myself properly.

08:43.890 --> 08:47.493
See, i used to be one of the
"insurance agents" around here,

08:47.894 --> 08:49.095
so i know how this works.

08:49.495 --> 08:51.497
I figure you already
called for backup.

08:51.532 --> 08:54.700
Is this the case?

08:58.304 --> 09:00.306
Agghh!

09:02.308 --> 09:05.111
Now, somebody's going to tell
me where i can find christina.

09:05.511 --> 09:07.478
Because otherwise...

09:07.513 --> 09:10.716
the bodies are really going
to start piling up around here.

09:19.525 --> 09:21.092
Hey, adam.

09:21.127 --> 09:23.930
So we haven't been able
to find anything else on maddox.

09:23.965 --> 09:27.133
No friends, no family,
no known associates.

09:28.734 --> 09:30.736
From the time they
put him into genomex he
would've ceased to exist.

09:30.771 --> 09:31.903
Where you going?

09:31.938 --> 09:33.539
Try to find some information.

09:33.574 --> 09:35.106
Wait. Hold it.

09:35.141 --> 09:36.742
So what are you doing?

09:37.143 --> 09:38.344
Going on off on
your own agenda again,

09:38.379 --> 09:39.545
and leave us all in the dark?

09:39.946 --> 09:42.348
I just don't want
to have this conversation.

09:42.383 --> 09:44.350
Yeah. Well,
we haven't settle anything.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.352
If where you're going
has something to do with maddox,

09:46.387 --> 09:47.919
then we all have
a right to know about it.

09:47.954 --> 09:49.956
And when
the burden of leadership
falls on your shoulders

09:49.991 --> 09:51.557
maybe you'll come to
understand that there are some

09:51.958 --> 09:53.559
decisions that you cannot make
by committee and there's some

09:53.594 --> 09:55.161
information that
has to stay private.

09:55.561 --> 09:56.362
Ah, so then you don't trust us.

09:56.762 --> 09:57.964
Yes, i do.

09:58.364 --> 09:59.966
There are other people who
trust me with their confidences

10:00.001 --> 10:01.567
and i keep them, even
though they don't deserve it,

10:01.602 --> 10:04.770
like the woman in this case.

10:06.372 --> 10:08.339
Okay.

10:08.374 --> 10:11.177
You know, what is with
adam and all of his secrets.

10:11.212 --> 10:12.778
We all have secrets.

10:13.179 --> 10:14.780
In fact, i've been around when
a few of yours have come back

10:14.815 --> 10:16.347
to bite you in the ass.

10:16.382 --> 10:17.984
But the difference is i don't
ask any of you to get involved

10:18.019 --> 10:20.003
in anything without
knowing what the downside is.

10:20.038 --> 10:21.988
Brennan, half of the
people adam uses as contacts

10:22.023 --> 10:23.554
don't even officially exist.

10:23.589 --> 10:24.990
What's the use
of knowing who they are?

10:25.025 --> 10:26.392
You gonna send
them a christmas card?

10:26.792 --> 10:27.959
No.

10:27.994 --> 10:29.595
What i'm saying is, i would
feel better knowing what the

10:29.630 --> 10:31.197
deal is before
i walk into something.

10:31.597 --> 10:33.199
No. What you're saying is
that you can't enjoy the ride if

10:33.234 --> 10:35.201
you're not driving the bus.

10:35.236 --> 10:36.402
Ouch.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.369
It was strange.

10:38.404 --> 10:40.406
When he was talking about
the person he was going to meet

10:40.441 --> 10:43.209
i got a hit off
his emotions about her.

10:43.244 --> 10:45.211
And?
- I don't know.

10:45.611 --> 10:46.777
There was feelings of...

10:46.812 --> 10:49.180
of anger and betrayal and fear.

10:49.215 --> 10:54.820
But as strong as any
of them, there was love.

12:28.514 --> 12:30.081
What are you doing here?

12:30.116 --> 12:32.083
I just wanted
to see where you worked.

12:32.118 --> 12:34.520
If you wanted to see
where i worked i could've
sent you a picture.

12:34.555 --> 12:36.087
You have to go.

12:36.122 --> 12:38.489
I have to be somewhere.

12:38.524 --> 12:40.491
Somewhere maddox can't find you?

12:40.526 --> 12:42.528
I should've known you'd
have it all figured out by now.

12:42.563 --> 12:44.095
Not everything.

12:44.130 --> 12:45.696
I need you to fill me in.

12:45.731 --> 12:47.298
We know that's
not going to happen.

12:47.333 --> 12:49.735
You can't just run away
from another one of your messes.

12:49.770 --> 12:52.103
Fortunately, i can.

12:52.138 --> 12:53.739
Because you didn't tell me
what kind of a prisoner he was,

12:54.140 --> 12:55.741
one of my people
almost got killed.

12:56.142 --> 12:57.743
I didn't think maddox's
people were that good.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.345
That wasn't supposed to happen.

12:59.380 --> 13:00.546
Yeah, well it did.

13:00.946 --> 13:02.548
And because it did, i'm
losing my team's confidence.

13:02.583 --> 13:04.150
You'll survive, adam.

13:04.185 --> 13:06.117
You always do.

13:06.152 --> 13:08.554
Listen, i'm going to guess
that you're the one who put

13:08.954 --> 13:10.556
maddox away, right?

13:10.956 --> 13:12.158
So, with him on the loose,

13:12.558 --> 13:14.560
i'd be looking for some
help right now, if i were you.

13:21.367 --> 13:23.334
I can take care of myself.
- Right.

13:23.369 --> 13:25.371
So that's why you're
packing up and running away?

13:25.406 --> 13:26.572
I have to go.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.539
We can talk about this later.

13:28.574 --> 13:30.176
See, this is how our
conversations always end.

13:30.211 --> 13:33.379
You run away,
nothing gets resolved.

13:45.391 --> 13:47.393
Secure the door.

13:53.799 --> 13:57.002
Damn.

13:58.204 --> 14:00.571
Hey, wait. What are you doing?

14:00.606 --> 14:01.807
I'm going to try
and get us out of this.

14:01.842 --> 14:03.008
You got a problem with that?

14:03.409 --> 14:04.610
You can't shoot your way out.

14:04.645 --> 14:06.212
He's too powerful.

14:07.813 --> 14:10.216
Oughtta listen
to him, christina...

14:10.251 --> 14:14.185
i know you're down here.

14:14.220 --> 14:17.423
Why don't you step out into
the light where i can see you?

14:17.458 --> 14:19.425
Christina!

14:22.628 --> 14:24.029
What are you doing?

14:24.064 --> 14:25.431
I'm saving your life.

14:25.466 --> 14:26.597
I had him.

14:26.632 --> 14:27.833
No, you didn't.

14:28.234 --> 14:30.636
If i hadn't pulled
you in we'd both be dead.

14:30.671 --> 14:33.003
You made a mistake
crossing me, christina.

14:33.038 --> 14:35.841
You made me what i am, and
then you tried to put me away

14:35.876 --> 14:38.644
because i did
what came naturally.

14:38.679 --> 14:41.046
You can't keep me out forever.

14:41.081 --> 14:43.013
I'll get in there.

14:43.048 --> 14:46.652
And then i'll take you
apart piece by piece by piece.

14:59.665 --> 15:01.232
He killed the phone.

15:01.267 --> 15:02.868
The comlink system
isn't working either.

15:03.269 --> 15:04.470
Are the walls lead-lined?

15:04.870 --> 15:06.472
Yeah.
Great.

15:06.872 --> 15:09.675
We're stuck in
here like rats in a trap.

15:09.710 --> 15:11.277
You should have
let me shoot him.

15:11.677 --> 15:13.679
If i hadn't pulled you in here
he'd have cut you to pieces.

15:13.714 --> 15:15.281
And what do you think's
going to happen to us in here?

15:15.316 --> 15:16.900
Well, we've got light.

15:16.935 --> 15:18.449
We've got ventilation.

15:18.484 --> 15:21.287
As long
as the doors hold i think
we should be good for days.

15:21.322 --> 15:23.654
And who's going to
find us in that time, huh?

15:23.689 --> 15:26.492
If they got this far, they've
already taken out my backup.

15:26.527 --> 15:28.093
Well, my people will miss me.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.660
They'll come looking.

15:29.695 --> 15:32.498
Oh, so you told
them where you were going?

15:33.699 --> 15:36.101
Get the drilling rig
and the c4 out of the car.

15:36.502 --> 15:38.068
I want this thing opened.

15:38.103 --> 15:40.906
That gear is supposed
to be for the bank job.

15:45.311 --> 15:49.315
This is the job now. Get it.

15:59.725 --> 16:02.127
You always push yourself
when you're worried.

16:02.528 --> 16:05.331
You know me pretty well, huh?

16:05.731 --> 16:09.700
I just don't like it.

16:09.735 --> 16:12.938
I mean, adam
told me he was only gonna
be gone for a little while.

16:13.339 --> 16:15.706
He's already been gone
for more than four hours.

16:15.741 --> 16:18.143
And his comlink's down, and
the gps on his car is disabled.

16:18.178 --> 16:20.162
Well, maybe he shut them off.

16:20.197 --> 16:22.112
He was meeting a secret source.

16:22.147 --> 16:24.950
Well, i'm not really worried
about his secret source.

16:24.985 --> 16:27.753
I'm more worried that
he might have run across maddox.

16:32.958 --> 16:34.960
He wouldn't have gone
after maddox on his own.

16:34.995 --> 16:36.562
Yeah, well, he
might not have had to.

16:36.962 --> 16:38.564
I'm guessing the woman he
went to see is probably the one

16:38.599 --> 16:40.165
who tried to put maddox away.

16:40.566 --> 16:42.968
So you think she
might be the first person
maddox may go looking for.

16:43.003 --> 16:44.935
Makes sense.

16:44.970 --> 16:47.738
If you ask me, adam
doesn't want us there.

16:47.773 --> 16:49.375
Look, guys, i was the one
who supported adam's right to

16:49.410 --> 16:50.976
privacy in the
first place, but, i mean,

16:51.011 --> 16:52.543
you know the procedure.

16:52.578 --> 16:54.580
When you're on a mission
you call in every four hours.

16:54.980 --> 16:56.947
It's adam's own rule.

16:56.982 --> 16:59.385
Yeah,
it's his rule and if he wants
to break it, it's his call.

16:59.420 --> 17:00.986
For all we know,
he's at a movie.

17:01.387 --> 17:02.553
Shal is right.

17:02.588 --> 17:03.389
Okay, he may not be in trouble,

17:03.789 --> 17:04.954
but what if trouble
is headed for him?

17:04.990 --> 17:06.957
So, what, we're going
to call out the cavalry?

17:06.992 --> 17:08.594
Look, adam'll be
pissed if we show up and
he's out on a hot date.

17:08.993 --> 17:10.160
A hot date?

17:10.194 --> 17:11.396
Yeah, a hot date.

17:11.797 --> 17:12.998
He said it was a woman,
you sensed those feelings...

17:13.032 --> 17:14.599
you know, i'm willing
to take that chance.

17:14.635 --> 17:16.602
I don't know about you guys.

17:16.637 --> 17:17.803
Okay.

17:18.203 --> 17:19.405
Then check his personal
terminal see if there's any

17:19.440 --> 17:21.006
communications
left in the cache.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.207
You check the police record

17:22.608 --> 17:24.209
- see if anything's
turned up on his vehicle.

17:24.243 --> 17:25.376
Nice.

17:25.411 --> 17:27.012
Adam's only gone a few hours
and you're giving out orders.

17:27.413 --> 17:28.614
Just do it, okay?

17:29.014 --> 17:31.817
Hey, it's a good call.

17:31.852 --> 17:34.637
I'm worried about him.

17:34.672 --> 17:37.423
Yeah, i know. Me, too.

17:40.626 --> 17:43.394
You ready to
tell me about maddox?

17:43.429 --> 17:45.431
He was an operative
who went over the line.

17:45.466 --> 17:47.032
I didn't know
your agency had a line.

17:47.433 --> 17:51.402
Everyone has lines.

17:51.437 --> 17:54.640
Maddox was trained to carry
out clandestine operations.

17:54.675 --> 17:55.806
Assassinations.

17:55.841 --> 17:57.643
Why don't you just say it?

17:57.678 --> 17:59.562
Are you going to let me speak?

17:59.597 --> 18:01.412
He forgot who
he was working for.

18:01.447 --> 18:04.249
Without our knowing, he'd
set up his own organization

18:04.284 --> 18:06.652
to pursue his own goals.

18:06.687 --> 18:07.818
Yeah.

18:07.853 --> 18:09.820
So he was doing his
dirty work instead of yours.

18:09.855 --> 18:12.257
I can see how your people
would be unhappy about that.

18:12.292 --> 18:15.277
Before you pick apart
other people's ethics, adam,

18:15.312 --> 18:18.263
remember who it is who
runs his own vigilante force.

18:18.664 --> 18:20.666
Or is that "different" because
you're so morally superior?

18:21.066 --> 18:22.232
Mutant x protects people.

18:22.267 --> 18:24.269
You took an orphan kid,
you put him into genomex,

18:24.670 --> 18:26.637
you turned him into
a high-powered killer.

18:26.672 --> 18:29.074
I knew there was no way to get
you to do the work we needed.

18:29.109 --> 18:33.043
The rest of genomex
was open for business.

18:33.078 --> 18:35.080
So the
whole time we were together
you used me to get to the

18:35.115 --> 18:36.682
people who could
give you what you wanted.

18:37.082 --> 18:37.883
It wasn't like that.

18:38.283 --> 18:39.485
No?

18:39.885 --> 18:41.487
My superiors
knew i was with you.

18:41.887 --> 18:43.088
I was given orders.

18:43.489 --> 18:44.655
Oh, orders, right.

18:44.690 --> 18:46.291
The classic way
to avoid responsibility.

18:46.692 --> 18:49.460
You got what you needed.

18:49.495 --> 18:52.297
The people i set
you up with helped finance
your exit from genomex.

18:52.332 --> 18:55.100
Without them
you'd never have been able
to put mutant x together.

18:55.135 --> 18:57.468
That seemed to be all
you cared about back then.

18:57.503 --> 18:59.470
Right. Because i was trying
to plug a leak in the dam,

18:59.505 --> 19:02.708
because you and your
people were busy making
monsters like maddox -

19:02.743 --> 19:04.675
behind my back.

19:04.710 --> 19:06.311
You had your mission.

19:06.346 --> 19:07.913
I had mine.

19:08.313 --> 19:11.116
Don't blame me
for us falling apart.

19:16.722 --> 19:18.724
It's started.

19:23.929 --> 19:25.896
A few more minutes.

19:25.931 --> 19:27.933
Then you get everything
you came for.

19:27.968 --> 19:29.134
How long?

19:29.535 --> 19:31.101
Six bolts.

19:31.136 --> 19:33.103
Ten minutes per bolt.

19:33.138 --> 19:34.740
Another two minutes
to pack the explosives.

19:35.140 --> 19:36.742
And another
minute to prime them.

19:36.777 --> 19:39.109
So what have we got?

19:39.144 --> 19:41.912
Seventy-eight minutes
before he gets in here.

19:41.947 --> 19:44.750
I suppose that number has
your usual level of accuracy?

19:44.785 --> 19:46.316
Well, there's no room for error.

19:46.351 --> 19:48.754
Now we just have to figure
out how to turn the tables.

19:48.789 --> 19:50.573
Turn the tables?

19:50.608 --> 19:52.322
Are you crazy?

19:52.357 --> 19:54.725
You're standing here analyzing
door thickness and drill

19:54.760 --> 19:57.127
ratios like you really believe
it's going to make a difference.

19:57.162 --> 20:01.166
Do you think our
survival is something you
can work out by the numbers?

20:01.201 --> 20:03.133
Why are you so sure it isn't?

20:03.168 --> 20:05.170
See, that is
the problem with you.

20:05.205 --> 20:06.772
You are so damned blinkered.

20:07.172 --> 20:09.139
You think that everything
can be solved by science.

20:09.174 --> 20:11.577
Well, i'll take science over
espionage any day of the week.

20:11.977 --> 20:13.579
Oh, this coming from the
man who sat at the centre of the

20:13.614 --> 20:17.583
biggest scientific disaster
the world has ever seen.

20:20.786 --> 20:22.387
I'm sorry, adam.

20:22.788 --> 20:25.190
I'm sorry, okay?

20:25.591 --> 20:27.157
I don't know.

20:27.192 --> 20:29.995
It's just everything
with you is so clear
cut, so black and white.

20:30.030 --> 20:31.997
Good or evil.

20:32.397 --> 20:34.399
Well, you know, maybe one of
us has to know the difference.

20:34.434 --> 20:36.001
Whether you want
to admit it or not,

20:36.401 --> 20:37.968
it's all about shades of grey.

20:38.003 --> 20:40.005
I don't want to get my
head around a world like that,

20:40.040 --> 20:41.572
where people, you
know, pretend to be lovers,

20:41.607 --> 20:44.009
where people warp the
truth to get what they want.

20:44.044 --> 20:46.777
You are still so pompous.

20:46.812 --> 20:49.615
It's like you have a special
relationship with the truth.

20:50.015 --> 20:54.820
It's like you see it so clearly,
but no one else has a clue.

20:54.855 --> 20:56.822
Well, i wouldn't want
to be on your team, adam,

20:56.857 --> 20:59.224
because with you,
it's not about teamwork.

20:59.625 --> 21:00.826
It's about ego.

21:01.226 --> 21:06.031
And for all your idealism,
it's still a one man show.

21:07.232 --> 21:08.433
Oh, this is so weird.

21:08.468 --> 21:09.635
Come here, check it out.

21:09.670 --> 21:10.836
Check this out.

21:10.871 --> 21:11.637
Thanks.

21:12.037 --> 21:13.238
Yeah.

21:13.273 --> 21:14.404
Okay.

21:14.439 --> 21:16.406
Adam erased the cache
memory in his computer.

21:16.441 --> 21:18.844
But he left a
history file in one of the
programs he was running.

21:18.879 --> 21:20.410
What program?

21:20.445 --> 21:22.412
Well, it's kind of
a... a net tracking program.

21:22.447 --> 21:24.049
It looks as if he was hunting
down somebody he was on a

21:24.449 --> 21:25.651
scrambled connection with.

21:25.686 --> 21:27.217
Show the results?

21:27.252 --> 21:29.620
No. But, i have been
reconstructing the search.

21:29.655 --> 21:32.858
It looks as if
the transmission came through
an insurance company server.

21:33.258 --> 21:35.260
Name of the insurance company?

21:35.295 --> 21:37.227
Chadway insurance.

21:37.262 --> 21:39.630
It's a hell of a time
to buy insurance.
- Yeah.

21:39.665 --> 21:42.467
Well, whoever adam was
trying to contact routed their

21:42.502 --> 21:44.069
communication
through a third party,

21:44.104 --> 21:45.671
so it's a dead end anyway.

21:45.706 --> 21:46.837
Or not...

21:46.872 --> 21:48.073
no, just move on.

21:48.473 --> 21:49.640
Look, i mean, maybe...

21:49.675 --> 21:51.276
maybe this server had
its own transmission history.

21:51.677 --> 21:53.243
And maybe it's
what adam broke into.

21:53.278 --> 21:55.280
Either way, i'm pretty
sure that i can complete
the search from there.

21:55.315 --> 21:56.882
Therefore, dead end not.

21:56.917 --> 21:57.683
Whatever.

21:58.083 --> 21:59.249
Okay?

21:59.284 --> 22:01.687
Let's just stop wasting time
yapping about it and just do it.

22:04.089 --> 22:05.290
Brennan?
- Yeah.

22:05.691 --> 22:08.493
I know you feel like you have
something to prove to adam here,

22:08.528 --> 22:10.095
but...
i don't have anything to prove.

22:10.495 --> 22:11.697
I want to find
him, plain and simple.

22:12.097 --> 22:13.699
You can't put the stress
you're feeling on the people who

22:13.734 --> 22:15.265
are trying to work with you.

22:15.300 --> 22:17.302
You want to take
the lead on this one?

22:17.337 --> 22:19.705
You gotta show some confidence.

22:19.740 --> 22:21.271
Oh, what?

22:21.306 --> 22:22.908
So i have to keep everything
all bottled up like adam does?

22:23.308 --> 22:24.875
That's the job, brennan.

22:24.910 --> 22:26.912
That's what he
was trying to tell you.

22:26.947 --> 22:30.515
Yeah.

22:37.322 --> 22:41.727
How much longer?
- Two more bolts. Then we blow.

22:41.762 --> 22:44.747
Maybe forty-five minutes.

22:44.782 --> 22:47.733
It's too damned long.

22:52.537 --> 22:54.539
I'll get them out.

23:04.549 --> 23:06.516
What is it?

23:06.551 --> 23:08.153
He's raising the heat.

23:08.553 --> 23:10.921
He's trying to drive us out.

23:10.956 --> 23:12.923
He couldn't produce
that much heat, could he?

23:12.958 --> 23:15.360
Well, assuming that his power
is only limited by the amount

23:15.395 --> 23:17.728
of sunlight that he takes
in, given a room temperature of

23:17.763 --> 23:22.968
about 75 degrees,
if he raises it 5 degrees
every fifteen minutes...

23:23.003 --> 23:25.370
adam, i want the
simple answer - yes, or no?

23:25.405 --> 23:27.372
Unless we figure
a way out of here,

23:27.407 --> 23:29.775
he's going to cook us alive.

23:37.849 --> 23:39.851
Well, adam's car hasn't turned
up on a single police record

23:39.886 --> 23:41.453
for a hundred mile radius.

23:41.853 --> 23:43.019
Yeah, i don't like this.

23:43.054 --> 23:44.621
I mean, adam
is brilliant enough.

23:44.656 --> 23:47.058
If he really wanted to cover his
tracks we may never find him.

23:47.093 --> 23:49.060
It might serve him right
for never trusting anybody.

23:49.095 --> 23:50.679
That's enough.

23:50.714 --> 23:52.229
'Scuse me?

23:52.264 --> 23:55.066
Somebody here spent the entire
morning in a screaming match

23:55.467 --> 23:57.869
with adam about
secrecy issues, right?

23:57.904 --> 23:59.035
Now who was that?

23:59.070 --> 24:01.072
Yeah, that was before
i knew he was in trouble.

24:01.107 --> 24:03.440
Trouble. Yeah, right.

24:03.475 --> 24:05.842
See, just so i know,
have i changed my opinion?

24:05.877 --> 24:07.879
Or are we still allowed
to think for ourselves
in this new regime.

24:08.280 --> 24:11.047
Jesse, would you
just cut him some slack?

24:11.082 --> 24:13.084
Who is it that decided that
brennan's suddenly in charge of

24:13.119 --> 24:14.686
this whole operation?

24:15.086 --> 24:16.688
And why does
he think that i'm not going
to think for myself anymore?

24:16.723 --> 24:19.090
Just because adam is gone
doesn't mean we can lose focus.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.092
If we want to find him
we have to do this together.

24:21.127 --> 24:22.911
You know, someone
here has to call the shots,

24:22.946 --> 24:24.696
and if you don't have
a real problem with it,

24:24.731 --> 24:27.499
i suggest that
we listen to brennan.

24:27.534 --> 24:29.065
Fine.

24:29.100 --> 24:32.304
See how it goes.

24:35.106 --> 24:37.073
Oh, hey, fearless leader,

24:37.108 --> 24:38.710
here's something
a little bit interesting.

24:38.745 --> 24:40.677
What's that?

24:40.712 --> 24:42.914
I've been running some checks
on that insurance company.

24:42.949 --> 24:45.116
You know, the one whose
server routed adam's message?

24:45.151 --> 24:46.718
Yeah, but that server's
just a front, right?

24:46.753 --> 24:47.919
Not necessarily.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.486
I think they exist.

24:49.521 --> 24:50.722
They've got an office downtown.

24:51.122 --> 24:52.289
So?

24:52.324 --> 24:53.925
Well, even though
i know it's a dead end,

24:53.960 --> 24:55.492
it's kind of interesting.

24:55.527 --> 24:57.929
And i can't
seem to find a single
policy that this insurance

24:57.964 --> 24:59.748
company has underwritten?

24:59.783 --> 25:01.498
Government?
- I don't know.

25:01.533 --> 25:03.134
But whoever it is they're
connected to the person who sent

25:03.169 --> 25:04.736
adam on the mission
to cover maddox, so it's...

25:05.136 --> 25:06.338
it's worth a visit.

25:06.738 --> 25:09.541
He sounds so commanding when
he says that, don't you think?

25:09.576 --> 25:12.344
Oh, is the "fearless leader"

25:12.379 --> 25:14.311
working for you, sir?

25:14.346 --> 25:19.150
Well, you know, just a... just
"sir" would work out all right.

25:19.185 --> 25:22.754
Go get the helix ready.

25:29.961 --> 25:34.366
Ugh! Drill faster!
- I can't!

25:34.766 --> 25:37.133
I burn the drill out,
we'll never get them out!

25:37.168 --> 25:39.971
All i hear from you are excuses
why i can't get what i want.

25:40.006 --> 25:42.339
You shouldn't be worried
about the drill burning out.

25:42.374 --> 25:45.977
You should start
worrying about your chances
of getting out of here.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.347
Not much left to take off.

25:50.382 --> 25:52.784
Well, if it gets any hotter,
clothes won't make a difference.

25:52.819 --> 25:54.386
You're supposed
to be the smart one.

25:54.421 --> 25:56.353
Figure it out.

25:56.388 --> 25:58.355
Oh, so now you're willing
to try a scientific approach?

25:58.390 --> 26:01.192
I'm willing to
try anything that'll get me
out of here in one piece.

26:01.227 --> 26:02.759
Preferably uncooked.

26:02.794 --> 26:05.597
I have an idea.
But it's fairly radical.

26:05.632 --> 26:07.564
You trust me?

26:07.599 --> 26:09.165
I don't trust anyone.

26:09.200 --> 26:11.202
This idea doesn't
have any grey areas.

26:11.237 --> 26:13.622
This is black and white.

26:13.657 --> 26:16.433
Live or die.
- Just do it.

26:16.468 --> 26:19.210
Okay. Stand over there.

26:27.218 --> 26:29.020
What did you do that for?!

26:29.055 --> 26:30.822
The water will cool us down.

26:30.857 --> 26:32.389
Guess what?

26:32.424 --> 26:34.391
It's also going to drown us.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.428
I've calculated the volume
of the room and the volume of

26:36.463 --> 26:38.795
water from a pipe
under normal water pressure.

26:38.830 --> 26:41.232
We're going to have enough
air until he opens the door.

26:41.267 --> 26:43.635
So he'll kill us wet.

26:43.670 --> 26:44.836
No, no, no.

26:45.236 --> 26:47.238
Because when he opens the
door, he's going to get hit with

26:47.273 --> 26:49.606
about forty-six
hundred gallons of water.

26:49.641 --> 26:52.043
And in the tidal wave
we'll make a break for it.

26:52.078 --> 26:53.462
That is crazy.

26:53.497 --> 26:54.846
That's right.

26:55.246 --> 26:58.450
But all we've got is crazy.

27:12.063 --> 27:15.667
Something's wrong.
I smell blood.

27:29.280 --> 27:32.449
People died here.

27:32.484 --> 27:35.687
Well, i guess maddox took an
interest in insurance, too, huh?

27:36.087 --> 27:38.054
I wonder why?

27:38.089 --> 27:40.892
Looks like in terms of adam
this just became a dead end.

27:40.927 --> 27:43.294
Put your damn hands
up where i can see them.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.064
Sir?

27:48.099 --> 27:50.101
Now might be a good time
to say a little something.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.103
Look, guys, we're
all on the same side.

27:52.504 --> 27:53.269
Shut up.

27:53.304 --> 27:54.506
I want to know who you work for.

27:54.541 --> 27:56.072
We don't work for anybody.

27:56.107 --> 27:57.708
We just came
looking for our friend.

27:57.743 --> 27:59.310
You killed five
people to find him.

27:59.345 --> 28:00.477
We didn't kill anybody.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.514
Maybe i'm not asking questions
that you can understand.

28:11.723 --> 28:12.889
Get up.

28:12.924 --> 28:14.125
Now you can answer
some questions for us.

28:14.526 --> 28:15.326
Not likely.

28:15.727 --> 28:16.893
Shut up and listen!

28:16.928 --> 28:19.731
We figure the guy that
did this is called maddox.

28:20.131 --> 28:22.098
Yeah, i thought that
might mean something to you.

28:22.133 --> 28:24.536
We were assigned
to cover his prison transfer
and he almost killed me.

28:24.936 --> 28:26.137
Look, i don't know
what you're talking about.

28:26.538 --> 28:27.739
No?

28:28.139 --> 28:30.141
Well, the woman in charge of
this supposed insurance agency

28:30.176 --> 28:32.108
set us up for that transfer.

28:32.143 --> 28:36.147
Now maddox is after
her and we think he knows
exactly where to find her.

28:36.182 --> 28:38.149
Tell me something.

28:38.184 --> 28:40.952
Come on.

28:41.352 --> 28:44.120
Come on, tell me something.

28:44.155 --> 28:47.759
Look, i know you're
not supposed to talk about
this kind of information.

28:48.159 --> 28:51.763
But there's a
lot of feelings that might
make you change your mind.

28:51.798 --> 28:58.970
Grief for you coworkers, concern
for your boss's safety...

28:59.370 --> 29:02.373
you know, we can help you.

29:02.408 --> 29:04.693
So what was that address?

29:04.728 --> 29:06.943
Don't have an address.

29:06.978 --> 29:09.781
It's a phone
number for her cell.

29:10.181 --> 29:14.185
555-0187.

29:14.586 --> 29:17.789
There, don't you feel better?

29:20.992 --> 29:23.359
Spooky.

29:23.394 --> 29:26.197
Just be glad she's on our side.

29:29.400 --> 29:31.803
How full is this
room going to get before
maddox opens the door?

29:32.203 --> 29:34.205
At a constant rate of drilling,
we'll have sufficient air.

29:34.606 --> 29:37.008
Just for the record,
what do you call sufficient?

29:37.043 --> 29:39.010
Oh, about an inch.

29:39.045 --> 29:40.577
Great.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.213
Well, we wouldn't be in this
situation if you and your team

29:42.248 --> 29:43.780
hadn't done what
you did to maddox.

29:43.815 --> 29:45.416
We used the technology
that was available.

29:45.451 --> 29:46.983
Same thing that you were doing.

29:47.018 --> 29:49.020
Same thing you're
still doing with mutant x.

29:49.420 --> 29:51.422
Yeah, except you
used it to create a killer.

29:51.457 --> 29:52.989
An operative.

29:53.024 --> 29:54.991
The killing is something
that came to him naturally.

29:55.026 --> 29:57.428
I'm sure that
would make a difference to
the families of his victims.

29:57.463 --> 29:58.595
You can't talk.

29:58.630 --> 30:00.231
You were the man who
created gabriel ashlocke.

30:00.632 --> 30:01.798
I was trying to help him.

30:01.833 --> 30:03.399
No, you were feeding your ego.

30:03.434 --> 30:05.436
You were so wrapped up in
patents and new discoveries that

30:05.471 --> 30:07.804
you didn't see what
was going on around you.

30:07.839 --> 30:10.642
Well, i certainly didn't
see what was going on with you.

30:10.677 --> 30:11.843
You know?

30:12.243 --> 30:13.845
It certainly took me long
enough to realize what your

30:14.245 --> 30:15.847
so-called government
job was all about.

30:15.882 --> 30:18.615
You didn't realize. I told you.

30:18.650 --> 30:20.251
And instead of working
out something between us,

30:20.286 --> 30:21.853
you just ended it.

30:23.054 --> 30:25.421
I didn't lie. I just couldn't
tell you the truth.

30:25.456 --> 30:27.859
You know about secrets, about
having things you can't share

30:27.894 --> 30:30.662
with anyone else, especially
those close to you?

30:31.062 --> 30:32.263
All right, so
we both had secrets.

30:32.664 --> 30:34.666
You know, maybe
that's why we got along.

30:34.701 --> 30:36.885
Got along?

30:36.920 --> 30:39.035
I loved you.

30:39.070 --> 30:40.637
Well, what about you?

30:40.672 --> 30:42.273
Would you have left
your agency to be with me?

30:42.308 --> 30:43.875
We could've found
a middle ground, adam.

30:43.910 --> 30:45.476
That's what people do.

30:47.478 --> 30:49.045
Oh, shoot.

30:49.080 --> 30:50.647
It's all right.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.684
Do you really think we're
going to make it out of this?

30:52.719 --> 30:53.885
Yes, i do.

30:54.285 --> 30:55.451
I believe in the plan.

30:55.486 --> 30:57.453
I believe the
calculations are right.

30:57.488 --> 31:01.893
So long as he keeps drilling
we'll have enough air.

31:09.500 --> 31:11.868
Harris, open the damned door!

31:11.903 --> 31:15.506
Lay off! I'm
going as fast as i can.

31:15.541 --> 31:17.508
Wrong answer.

31:25.116 --> 31:27.083
Adam?

31:27.118 --> 31:30.321
You said the air
would hold out as long as
they didn't stop drilling.

31:30.722 --> 31:33.124
I don't hear a drill.

31:37.195 --> 31:39.197
All right, so we've
got a cell phone number.

31:39.232 --> 31:40.763
Well, that's not a lot to go on.

31:40.798 --> 31:42.400
Yeah, is that number registered
on the system right now?

31:42.435 --> 31:43.967
No. It might be turned off.

31:44.002 --> 31:46.004
Or, it's not getting
a signal, like adam's comlink.

31:46.404 --> 31:48.006
Which means we can't track 'em.

31:48.041 --> 31:49.207
Hey, you know what?

31:49.242 --> 31:50.773
Maybe we can.

31:50.808 --> 31:52.410
When a cell phone is left on,
it leaves a digital trail as

31:52.810 --> 31:54.412
it moves around from
cell node to cell node.

31:54.447 --> 31:55.979
Emma, patch us into
the sanctuary system.

31:56.014 --> 31:57.615
Maybe jesse can use
that to locate the last node

31:57.650 --> 31:59.217
that number was registered on.

31:59.252 --> 32:01.219
Great. Thanks, emma.

32:01.619 --> 32:03.186
It's coming up.

32:03.221 --> 32:04.822
We should be able to
narrow it down to a couple
block radius with that,

32:05.223 --> 32:07.225
and if adam's
car is parked outside
we can zone in from there.

32:07.260 --> 32:10.028
Okay, last place that cell
phone was registered was across

32:10.428 --> 32:12.795
town in forest heights.

32:12.830 --> 32:14.432
It's bout time
we caught a break here.

32:14.832 --> 32:18.436
Next stop, forest heights.

32:22.440 --> 32:24.007
Hey.
- Hey.

32:24.042 --> 32:26.044
How you doing?
- Good.

32:26.444 --> 32:28.846
You know, i was beginning to
wonder whether brennan and jesse

32:29.247 --> 32:31.649
were going to get through
this without killing each other.

32:32.050 --> 32:34.852
Yeah, i guess i never really
thought about that whole power

32:35.253 --> 32:38.021
struggle thing, either.

32:38.056 --> 32:40.458
Hm. Well, that's
probably a good thing.

32:40.493 --> 32:42.860
It means you're
not a control freak.

32:42.895 --> 32:45.628
I guess.

32:45.663 --> 32:50.068
You know, it's just so
strange being a part of a group.

32:50.468 --> 32:51.669
You know, it's just,

32:52.070 --> 32:54.472
never really thought
about running one, you know?

32:54.507 --> 32:56.874
I thought all ferals
had pack instincts.

32:57.275 --> 32:59.877
Well, i don't know what the
psychology is, but, you know,

32:59.912 --> 33:02.480
before adam brought me in,
i was a lone wolf the whole way.

33:02.515 --> 33:06.484
You must have
had friends as a kid.

33:06.519 --> 33:10.453
I scared all my friends.

33:10.488 --> 33:15.693
I think it started
when i made my ex-boyfriend
eat his math textbook.

33:15.728 --> 33:18.496
Yeah, that would probably do it.

33:18.531 --> 33:20.063
<laughing> what about you?

33:20.098 --> 33:24.102
Any desire to be
the queen of mutant x?
- No.

33:24.137 --> 33:26.869
I'm... i'm the same as you.

33:26.904 --> 33:30.508
I'm just so grateful that
i have these four amazing people

33:30.543 --> 33:33.528
in my life now
who aren't scared of me.

33:33.563 --> 33:36.479
You know, leadership
isn't really an issue.

33:36.514 --> 33:40.117
I'm just glad you guys
don't all think i'm a freak.

33:40.152 --> 33:43.721
Well, i think we're
all in the same boat there.

33:43.756 --> 33:46.524
You know, when
that whole power thing...

33:46.924 --> 33:49.727
i think... i think it
has more to do with testosterone

33:50.128 --> 33:51.329
than anything else.

33:51.729 --> 33:53.731
You know, and i don't think
jesse wants to boss anybody

33:53.766 --> 33:55.698
around, but brennan,

33:55.733 --> 33:57.335
he goes all alpha male
and jesse just gets his back up.

33:57.370 --> 33:59.755
That's exactly
what it felt like.

33:59.790 --> 34:02.105
If brennan didn't
want to run things,

34:02.140 --> 34:05.708
i think jesse would step
up and insist that he did.

34:05.743 --> 34:08.146
You know, i don't know what
jesse would do with himself if

34:08.181 --> 34:10.547
he wasn't swimming
against the current.

34:10.947 --> 34:15.353
If that makes any sense at all.

34:15.753 --> 34:19.757
I think it makes as much sense
as anything does around here.

34:33.371 --> 34:35.773
Okay, they only stopped
drilling for two minutes.

34:36.174 --> 34:38.176
That shouldn't throw
off my calculations too much.

34:38.576 --> 34:41.379
We're going to die
in here, aren't we?
- No.

34:41.779 --> 34:43.781
No, because this
isn't how i pictured it.

34:43.815 --> 34:45.348
How did you see your death?

34:45.382 --> 34:47.750
Well, i always saw
myself dying of old age.

34:47.784 --> 34:49.786
You know, with lots of
friends and colleagues lined up

34:49.822 --> 34:51.353
to pay their respects.

34:51.389 --> 34:53.356
Of course, as it turns out,

34:53.391 --> 34:54.992
i don't have any
friends and colleagues,

34:55.027 --> 34:56.559
except for mutant x.

34:56.594 --> 34:57.795
And the way things are going,

34:58.196 --> 34:59.397
i'm not sure
that they'd show up.

34:59.432 --> 35:00.963
How about you?

35:00.998 --> 35:02.965
Did you ever think about this?

35:03.000 --> 35:05.002
Gunfight with foreign
agents, car chase,

35:05.037 --> 35:06.569
pipe bomb under the seat.

35:06.604 --> 35:09.372
Something a little more active.

35:09.407 --> 35:11.409
Drowning in a vault,
that's pretty active.

35:15.813 --> 35:17.815
Did you miss me, adam?

35:17.850 --> 35:19.817
Yeah, i missed you.

35:20.218 --> 35:22.985
I missed you every day.

35:23.020 --> 35:24.622
I used to think being
angry with you would burn it out

35:25.022 --> 35:26.989
of me and it hasn't.

35:27.024 --> 35:29.026
Is that why you kept in contact?

35:29.061 --> 35:31.394
Well, yeah, maybe.

35:31.429 --> 35:38.236
But you were too
stubborn to say anything.

35:38.271 --> 35:40.238
Yeah. And what about you?

35:40.273 --> 35:41.804
Huh?

35:41.839 --> 35:45.042
I mean, did you ever think about
what you might do different

35:45.077 --> 35:47.044
if you had to do it over again?

35:47.445 --> 35:50.247
You can't go back.

35:50.282 --> 35:53.015
No. But if you could?

35:53.050 --> 35:55.453
I never would've hurt you.

36:10.268 --> 36:13.035
Why'd you stop?

36:13.070 --> 36:17.475
I'm done. That
was the last bolt.

36:17.875 --> 36:21.078
I just have
to pack the explosive.

36:21.113 --> 36:25.082
And prime it.

36:28.286 --> 36:31.889
I'm coming for you, christina.

36:31.924 --> 36:34.292
I'm coming.

36:38.296 --> 36:41.499
The cell node's within
a hundred feet of here.

36:41.534 --> 36:45.868
It's adam's car, right there.

36:45.903 --> 36:51.909
Now we just got to know
where he went from there.

36:53.911 --> 36:58.716
That's it. Ready to blow.

37:02.720 --> 37:07.525
Now that the moment's here,
i almost don't want to rush it.

37:07.560 --> 37:11.529
A couple of seconds from
now, we'll be face to face.

37:11.564 --> 37:14.732
A second after
that, she'll be dead.

37:14.767 --> 37:18.336
I want to savour the moment.

37:25.142 --> 37:28.346
Hell of a time
to find each other.

37:28.746 --> 37:33.150
Yeah, well, you know, timing
was never our strong suit.

37:36.354 --> 37:38.756
You ready?

37:39.957 --> 37:41.959
Time to die, christina.

37:45.162 --> 37:46.764
There!

38:11.155 --> 38:14.158
Ah, oh...!

38:14.193 --> 38:17.161
You okay?

38:21.565 --> 38:23.968
Come on.

38:26.771 --> 38:29.138
Not so fast, christina.

38:29.173 --> 38:31.775
You put me in
a hole for six months.

38:31.810 --> 38:34.343
And you tried
to put me away forever.

38:34.378 --> 38:36.781
Do you think they were
going to just let you run wild?

38:36.816 --> 38:39.183
Killing you will let
them know not to try again.

38:40.785 --> 38:41.986
Maddox!

38:45.189 --> 38:47.191
I'm going to finish
what i came to do.

38:47.226 --> 38:48.610
Get out of the water!

38:48.645 --> 38:49.994
Get out of the water!

38:50.029 --> 38:52.396
Aghh...!

39:03.207 --> 39:05.209
Come on.

39:08.412 --> 39:09.813
No, i'm not going to apologize.

39:09.848 --> 39:11.215
Come on, jesse,
now's your chance.

39:11.250 --> 39:12.782
No.

39:12.817 --> 39:14.418
Jess?
- What?

39:14.453 --> 39:16.821
Tell him.

39:17.221 --> 39:19.588
Tell me what?

39:19.623 --> 39:21.225
Come on, jess. You can do it.

39:21.260 --> 39:22.827
Just say the words.

39:23.227 --> 39:25.594
Okay. Okay.

39:25.629 --> 39:30.434
I thought you did
okay as an interim leader.

39:32.837 --> 39:35.239
And...?

39:35.639 --> 39:37.206
And...

39:37.241 --> 39:42.446
i am sorry for giving
you so much grief before.

39:42.481 --> 39:46.450
Sort of.

39:46.851 --> 39:49.253
Thanks. It's a real
vote of confidence...

39:49.288 --> 39:52.857
i think.

40:02.867 --> 40:04.468
Hey.
- Hey.

40:04.869 --> 40:08.838
I want to apologize.

40:08.873 --> 40:14.078
I... i realize now that you
can't always tell us everything.

40:14.113 --> 40:16.881
Well, that's funny, because
i was just wondering how to

40:16.916 --> 40:20.049
apologize to the four of you.

40:20.084 --> 40:22.486
I think almost dying in
that safe room put some things

40:22.521 --> 40:24.488
in perspective for me.

40:24.523 --> 40:25.654
Oh, yeah?

40:25.689 --> 40:27.291
Is that because
you were trapped,

40:27.326 --> 40:28.893
or who you were trapped with?

40:28.928 --> 40:30.459
Might've been both.

40:30.494 --> 40:33.297
You did a good job
in holding things together
when i was in there.

40:33.332 --> 40:34.899
Thank you very much.

40:35.299 --> 40:36.901
You know, i'm beginning
to realize now how difficult

40:36.936 --> 40:38.502
leadership can be.

40:38.903 --> 40:40.905
And i know it's not easy
working with me sometimes,

40:40.940 --> 40:42.106
not getting the whole picture.

40:42.506 --> 40:44.108
And i realized something
about myself in there.

40:44.508 --> 40:47.711
Which is; that sometimes
i hold back so that i can be the

40:47.746 --> 40:49.730
only one who sees all the cards,

40:49.765 --> 40:51.715
so that i can stay in control.

40:52.116 --> 40:53.717
Well, you gotta do
what you gotta do, right?

40:53.752 --> 40:55.336
No. I'm saying that's wrong.

40:55.371 --> 40:56.946
If you guys share in the danger,

40:56.981 --> 40:58.487
you should share
the information.

40:58.522 --> 41:00.124
Glad you think that way
because now you can explain

41:00.159 --> 41:02.091
to me who christina is.

41:02.126 --> 41:08.532
Some things remain
a mystery... even to me.

41:08.567 --> 41:12.136
Ah, well, thanks again, huh?

41:23.747 --> 41:25.314
Adam?

41:25.349 --> 41:27.351
Do we really need to scramble?

41:27.751 --> 41:30.920
What is it?

41:30.955 --> 41:33.757
I was just thinking about
some of the things we said.

41:33.792 --> 41:35.759
I thought we were going to die.

41:36.160 --> 41:39.163
People say things
they don't normally say.

41:39.198 --> 41:42.166
Still, sometimes
things need to be said.

41:42.566 --> 41:45.334
We can't just pick
up where we left off.

41:45.369 --> 41:47.771
We're still the same people
we were, when we went in there.

41:48.172 --> 41:50.940
Are we?

41:50.975 --> 41:54.178
You know where to find me.
