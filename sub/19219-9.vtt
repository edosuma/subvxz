WEBVTT

00:01.044 --> 00:02.212
Previously on "The 100"...

00:02.420 --> 00:04.005
The death wave will be
here in 10 days.

00:04.214 --> 00:07.759
What I found was
a fallout shelter,

00:07.968 --> 00:09.386
salvation lies within.

00:09.594 --> 00:10.512
The radiation
doesn't care

00:10.720 --> 00:12.013
if you're Trikru
or Azgeda.

00:12.222 --> 00:14.599
Azgeda will never
see the inside.

00:14.808 --> 00:15.892
What if we share it?

00:16.101 --> 00:17.227
I can live with that.

00:17.435 --> 00:18.728
When the time comes
to close the door,

00:18.937 --> 00:20.480
Azgeda will see
that it's done.

00:21.940 --> 00:23.024
I'll take you home.

00:24.567 --> 00:26.653
Raven, you need
to slow down.

00:26.861 --> 00:28.989
Your brain scan showed
evidence of a stroke.

00:29.197 --> 00:30.657
The door is stuck.

00:30.865 --> 00:32.200
Raven, it could
kill you.

00:32.409 --> 00:33.410
We can't
create Nightblood

00:33.618 --> 00:34.411
unless we
go to space,

00:34.619 --> 00:35.870
but Luna can.

00:36.079 --> 00:37.622
We can inject ourselves
with her bone marrow.

00:37.831 --> 00:38.957
Then we
become Nightbloods.

00:39.165 --> 00:40.917
I bear it so
they don't have to.

00:41.126 --> 00:42.002
One day,
they will thank you

00:42.210 --> 00:43.795
for what you're doing here.

00:44.004 --> 00:45.714
What if it doesn't work?

00:45.922 --> 00:47.007
Then we die,

00:47.215 --> 00:48.675
knowing we did
everything we could

00:48.883 --> 00:49.968
to save our people.

00:53.096 --> 00:53.972
I got it.

00:54.472 --> 00:56.099
It's heavy.

00:56.307 --> 00:57.183
Uhh.

00:59.811 --> 01:01.688
This is why
they left us behind?

01:01.896 --> 01:03.314
To scavenge tech?

01:03.523 --> 01:04.983
Hey,
we talked about this.

01:05.191 --> 01:05.900
We didn't get
left behind.

01:06.109 --> 01:07.068
They're coming back.

01:07.277 --> 01:08.945
Forgive me
if I don't believe

01:09.154 --> 01:11.364
what your people
say anymore.

01:11.573 --> 01:13.033
Murphy's actually right.

01:13.241 --> 01:14.534
Don't worry,
they might ditch him,

01:14.743 --> 01:16.619
but I'm too awesome
to leave behind.

01:17.370 --> 01:19.122
- There you go.
- Congratulations, Emori.

01:19.330 --> 01:20.665
You get to live

01:20.874 --> 01:22.333
in a hole in the ground
for 5 years.

01:22.542 --> 01:23.543
Thanks for playing.

01:23.752 --> 01:25.086
Come on.
At least we get to live.

01:25.295 --> 01:26.588
Said the cockroach
to the Raven.

01:28.256 --> 01:29.758
Systems check complete.

01:33.053 --> 01:33.928
What?

01:34.679 --> 01:36.473
Orbital
launch systems online.

01:36.681 --> 01:37.724
You don't hear that?

01:40.060 --> 01:40.769
Emori, get the
seizure kit now.

01:40.977 --> 01:41.644
Abby left it
in the office.

01:41.853 --> 01:42.687
No.

01:42.896 --> 01:45.148
No, it's--it's OK.

01:45.815 --> 01:46.858
It's OK.
I'm fine.

01:47.776 --> 01:49.402
Put that stuff
with the gear
for the last run.

01:49.611 --> 01:51.279
I'll start on
the processors.

01:51.488 --> 01:53.490
No, no, no, no.
No coding, all right?

01:53.698 --> 01:54.908
Luna's not
here to whisper
in your ear

01:55.116 --> 01:55.742
and I'd
rather not have
your brain

01:55.950 --> 01:56.993
melt on
my watch.

01:57.202 --> 01:59.329
I'm not coding.
I'm unhooking.

01:59.871 --> 02:00.830
Now do what I said.

02:01.039 --> 02:02.082
Then you can
take a break.

02:03.750 --> 02:05.210
I'll need
some time with this.

02:08.213 --> 02:09.172
Sure thing.

02:10.131 --> 02:11.091
Come on.

02:13.802 --> 02:15.386
What's the matter now?

02:15.595 --> 02:17.138
If she can't
use her brain,

02:17.347 --> 02:18.389
why do they need her?

02:35.615 --> 02:37.909
Initiating
ground launch sequencer now.

02:40.370 --> 02:41.121
Uhh.

02:43.957 --> 02:44.833
Raven.

02:45.416 --> 02:46.209
Becca?

02:47.710 --> 02:49.420
You can tell me that
it's none of my business,

02:49.629 --> 02:51.422
but why live in
a hole in the ground

02:52.590 --> 02:54.551
when you have
a perfectly good rocket?

03:52.650 --> 03:54.402
Are you
tilling the soil
or stabbing it?

03:55.195 --> 03:56.654
You know this is
dumb, right?

03:58.156 --> 03:59.908
We'll all be dead
before anything grows.

04:00.116 --> 04:01.618
The earth survived
Praimfaya once.

04:01.826 --> 04:02.869
It will again.

04:03.828 --> 04:05.622
We do this for those
who come after us.

04:07.832 --> 04:09.083
Let me show you.

04:10.543 --> 04:11.794
Ilian.

04:13.504 --> 04:14.797
Head down.
Say nothing.

04:15.006 --> 04:16.174
My people are
wary of strangers.

04:17.175 --> 04:18.384
Ankara.

04:21.554 --> 04:22.263
War.

05:06.057 --> 05:07.809
You didn't tell me
you were a warrior.

05:12.188 --> 05:14.399
Not much point
in fighting at
the end of the world.

05:18.861 --> 05:21.489
Yeah!

05:21.698 --> 05:23.700
There is
an underground aquifer

05:23.908 --> 05:26.828
with a filtration system
that is still operational.

05:27.036 --> 05:29.372
Some of the water
will go to the
hydroponic farm.

05:29.580 --> 05:30.832
Isn't that right,
Mr. Green?

05:31.040 --> 05:32.542
Most beautiful
thing I've
ever seen.

05:33.584 --> 05:34.544
Almost.

05:34.752 --> 05:36.129
It won't be easy.

05:36.337 --> 05:39.173
There will be plenty
of hard work to go around.

05:39.882 --> 05:41.718
But together we have struggled.

05:41.926 --> 05:44.595
And together we will rise.

05:46.222 --> 05:49.142
Pack your things.
Just what you can carry.

05:49.350 --> 05:50.852
We leave at first light.

05:51.519 --> 05:53.521
Thank you.
Thank you.

05:53.730 --> 05:56.065
- You're a hero, Monty.
- Stop.

05:56.441 --> 05:57.442
Go back.

05:57.650 --> 05:58.526
I'll be there
as soon as we

05:58.735 --> 05:59.944
finish with
the armory.

06:05.783 --> 06:06.993
Jaha was right.

06:07.952 --> 06:09.787
Got a lot
of gear to pack.

06:09.954 --> 06:11.664
Sure you're not
too hung over?

06:11.873 --> 06:13.458
You judging me, Monty?

06:13.666 --> 06:14.417
A little.

06:15.543 --> 06:17.378
There was no hope.
Now there's hope.

06:18.379 --> 06:19.255
Let's go.

06:23.676 --> 06:24.469
Jasper...

06:26.429 --> 06:27.513
You're gonna love it.

06:32.060 --> 06:32.977
Give him a minute.

06:33.186 --> 06:34.562
They'll figure it out
when we take the still.

06:34.771 --> 06:35.688
We don't need it.

06:35.897 --> 06:36.939
There's one in the bunker.

06:37.982 --> 06:39.525
My little boy's
all grown up.

06:40.860 --> 06:42.153
So what?

06:42.362 --> 06:43.863
We hole up
in a bunker now?

06:44.072 --> 06:46.282
Do everything
Jaha says?

06:46.491 --> 06:47.909
Back to life
on the ark?

06:48.117 --> 06:50.453
Now that is
just crazy talk.

06:50.661 --> 06:52.330
Since when do we
listen to what Jaha says?

07:04.967 --> 07:05.885
The tunnel's just
through those woods.

07:06.094 --> 07:07.220
How long
are you staying?

07:07.428 --> 07:08.137
Quick turnaround.
If you forgot anything

07:08.346 --> 07:09.389
at the lab, let me know.

07:09.597 --> 07:10.807
Or I could
keep you company.

07:15.144 --> 07:16.145
Right.

07:19.607 --> 07:21.234
Clarke, can I talk
to you for a second?

07:22.652 --> 07:23.694
I'll catch up.

07:26.739 --> 07:27.990
What's wrong?

07:30.159 --> 07:31.536
There's something
I didn't tell you.

07:33.079 --> 07:35.331
Indra was with them
when they found
the bunker.

07:36.582 --> 07:37.625
Trikru knows?

07:37.834 --> 07:39.502
Yes. We made
a deal with them

07:39.710 --> 07:40.878
to share the space.

07:42.088 --> 07:43.798
What about
our deal with Roan?

07:44.006 --> 07:45.425
Trikru would rather
go to war

07:45.633 --> 07:46.676
than live
with Azgeda.

07:46.884 --> 07:48.803
Mom, Roan is
my friend.

07:49.345 --> 07:50.471
Our ally.

07:51.472 --> 07:52.682
Not anymore.

07:55.309 --> 07:56.727
Why didn't you
tell me this before?

07:59.981 --> 08:01.023
They're gonna
kill him.

08:01.232 --> 08:02.525
No, Clarke,

08:02.733 --> 08:04.318
not if he
comes peacefully.

08:04.527 --> 08:06.404
We will make room
for one.

08:06.612 --> 08:08.156
Indra agreed.

08:10.158 --> 08:11.033
Uh!

08:17.790 --> 08:19.000
Gentlemen.

08:20.042 --> 08:21.210
It's good to see you.

08:22.503 --> 08:24.088
Just--wait here.

08:27.675 --> 08:28.885
Where are the guards?

08:29.093 --> 08:30.761
Our people
aren't back
from Arkadia yet.

08:32.054 --> 08:34.182
- Kane, don't. Roan!
- Look. Wait.

08:37.768 --> 08:38.603
Trikru.

08:38.811 --> 08:40.271
What is this?

08:40.480 --> 08:41.564
There doesn't
have to be
any violence.

08:49.572 --> 08:50.573
Wait, stop!

09:06.589 --> 09:08.466
Welcome back to Polis, my king.

09:38.829 --> 09:40.081
I said, explain.

09:40.623 --> 09:41.666
Skaikru allied
with Trikru

09:41.874 --> 09:43.000
to take the temple.

09:43.209 --> 09:45.044
They gave up
the tower to do it.

09:45.253 --> 09:47.129
Strategically,
that made no sense,

09:47.338 --> 09:49.590
so I put our people
at the temple doors.

09:49.799 --> 09:50.967
Good thing I did.

09:51.175 --> 09:52.885
You did well, Echo.

09:53.094 --> 09:54.679
Move the rest of our army
to the temple doors.

09:54.887 --> 09:56.138
No one gets in or out.

09:59.267 --> 10:00.393
Go.

10:17.368 --> 10:18.452
How long
have you known?

10:18.661 --> 10:19.620
I just found out.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.252
Thanks for trying
to warn me.

10:26.460 --> 10:27.628
This doesn't have
to turn into a war.

10:28.004 --> 10:29.005
It's already a war.

10:29.213 --> 10:30.548
Only if
you fight it.

10:31.424 --> 10:33.509
Your people
betrayed me, Clarke.

10:34.552 --> 10:36.137
What would you
have me do?

10:36.345 --> 10:37.179
Live?

10:38.347 --> 10:39.557
The radiation's
gonna be here

10:39.765 --> 10:41.267
in 6 days.

10:41.684 --> 10:43.184
You were willing
to share the bunker with us.

10:43.185 --> 10:44.478
Why not share it
with Trikru, too?

10:44.687 --> 10:46.230
I suppose Kane tried
to get Indra to do that

10:46.439 --> 10:48.441
before agreeing to
let them assassinate me.

10:48.649 --> 10:49.775
Believe it or not,

10:49.984 --> 10:51.611
Kane was trying
to save your life.

10:51.819 --> 10:53.946
Mine, maybe.
Not my people's.

10:54.614 --> 10:56.991
That was before you
surrounded the temple.

10:57.783 --> 11:00.494
Look, now no one
can get in to survive

11:00.703 --> 11:01.871
unless you allow it.

11:02.121 --> 11:04.081
Indra will have
no choice but to talk.

11:08.336 --> 11:10.713
Fine. We'll talk.

11:12.590 --> 11:13.758
But I'm holding
your people.

11:13.966 --> 11:15.926
My chancellor needs to be
at that meeting, Roan.

11:16.135 --> 11:18.804
Your chancellor's lucky
he still has his head.

11:19.597 --> 11:22.099
Besides, if anyone
can convince

11:22.308 --> 11:26.979
mortal enemies to move
in together, it's you.

11:29.148 --> 11:30.358
I'll call for the summit.

11:46.415 --> 11:49.001
All I can think about is
there's a war going on

11:49.835 --> 11:50.961
and I'm not in it.

11:52.963 --> 11:55.758
No war will
stop Praimfaya.

11:55.966 --> 11:58.594
At least it would be
a warrior's death.

11:59.178 --> 12:00.846
Better than melting.

12:01.514 --> 12:02.682
My people have a saying:

12:12.191 --> 12:13.567
Reincarnation?

12:15.778 --> 12:16.821
You believe in that?

12:22.201 --> 12:24.078
The crops, they die
in winter

12:25.955 --> 12:27.707
and then return
in spring.

12:28.874 --> 12:31.627
Most people don't know when
their winter will come,

12:32.712 --> 12:34.463
but we do.

12:35.756 --> 12:37.049
And that's a gift.

12:40.886 --> 12:42.555
Why waste it
in fighting?

12:58.529 --> 12:59.447
You're not packed.

13:00.865 --> 13:02.116
I tried.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.459
Talk to me, Harper.

13:16.464 --> 13:18.758
Just tired of
fighting, Monty.

13:21.761 --> 13:22.887
I know.

13:23.554 --> 13:24.930
We all are.

13:25.765 --> 13:27.683
But in that bunker,
we'll be safe.

13:28.851 --> 13:31.896
Every time we think that,
something bad happens.

13:34.523 --> 13:38.360
So what then?
Stay here and die?

13:38.569 --> 13:40.154
Spend your
last days wasted?

13:40.362 --> 13:41.280
That seems to be
a popular choice

13:41.489 --> 13:42.615
with the people
I care about.

13:42.823 --> 13:44.950
- Monty, I--
- it'll be light out soon.

13:45.993 --> 13:49.497
That bunker gives us
a chance for a future.

13:53.167 --> 13:54.460
I hope you'll change
your mind.

13:59.048 --> 14:00.466
I won't.

14:11.811 --> 14:16.023
I was, um--I was
thinking about Louis.

14:16.232 --> 14:18.567
About how you blame
yourself for his death

14:18.776 --> 14:19.777
because you didn't
stop to save him

14:19.985 --> 14:21.403
from the black rain.

14:22.196 --> 14:23.239
You didn't do that
because you were

14:23.447 --> 14:24.615
a coward, Harper.

14:24.824 --> 14:27.201
You did that because
you wanted to live.

14:27.910 --> 14:29.787
It's called
survival instinct.

14:31.205 --> 14:32.873
This is the first time

14:34.083 --> 14:35.835
I ever thought
you were a coward.

14:56.146 --> 14:57.481
Aren't you going
the wrong way?

15:17.251 --> 15:18.627
Come to say
good-bye?

15:25.676 --> 15:27.177
Hell no.

15:34.602 --> 15:35.519
Hey.

15:37.021 --> 15:38.731
I thought
I made it clear.

15:38.939 --> 15:39.815
We need
everyone packed

15:40.024 --> 15:40.816
and ready
to go by--

15:41.025 --> 15:42.026
first light.

15:42.651 --> 15:43.736
We'll get
right on it.

15:45.529 --> 15:46.572
Good.

15:48.115 --> 15:49.241
We're talking
about the future
of the human race

15:49.450 --> 15:50.868
here, Mr. Jordan.

15:51.076 --> 15:53.203
Participation
is not optional.

16:05.132 --> 16:06.550
They're gonna make
us go with them.

16:06.759 --> 16:08.052
It's a test.

16:08.260 --> 16:09.887
How bad do we want this?

16:10.095 --> 16:12.598
There is a way out now.

16:12.806 --> 16:15.059
When this party started,
that wasn't true.

16:15.225 --> 16:16.477
Make no mistake--
you choose to stay

16:16.685 --> 16:18.604
and you're choosing death.

16:18.812 --> 16:22.691
If that's your decision,
I'm with you all the way.

16:23.359 --> 16:25.945
If not, there's the door.

16:26.195 --> 16:28.530
No one here will judge you
if you leave.

16:34.912 --> 16:36.121
OK, then.

16:37.623 --> 16:39.541
I guess we have
nothing to lose.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.930
You can't ignore
me forever, Raven.

16:54.807 --> 16:56.475
I mean, I guess
you could try,

16:57.101 --> 16:58.852
but we're the same,
you and I,

17:00.062 --> 17:01.397
and I know
the truth.

17:01.647 --> 17:03.857
You don't want to
live in a bunker,

17:04.316 --> 17:05.651
and you don't want
to be the good
little soldier,

17:05.859 --> 17:07.903
always doing what
Clarke tells you
to do.

17:08.112 --> 17:10.114
I know what
you do want.

17:10.322 --> 17:11.865
Stop. Stop!

17:12.866 --> 17:15.452
God, you're not--
you're not real.

17:15.703 --> 17:17.246
You're just--

17:17.454 --> 17:19.123
that doesn't mean
that I'm not right.

17:21.041 --> 17:23.002
What the hell do you
want from me?

17:23.210 --> 17:24.753
I want to help you.

17:24.962 --> 17:26.839
Your time is
running out.

17:27.047 --> 17:29.299
And I'm not talking
about the radiation.

17:30.384 --> 17:32.094
I'm talking
about your brain.

17:34.263 --> 17:36.849
You need to
ask yourself--

17:37.057 --> 17:38.892
how are you
gonna go out?

17:39.143 --> 17:40.644
Down here?

17:41.770 --> 17:44.523
Miserable? In pain?

17:45.274 --> 17:49.570
Or up there?
Free? Floating?

17:49.778 --> 17:51.030
I've run all
the simulations.

17:51.238 --> 17:52.531
There's not enough
fuel to get back.

17:52.740 --> 17:54.366
Who said anything
about getting back?

17:56.618 --> 17:58.787
Your friends
are taken care of.

17:58.996 --> 18:00.289
They don't need you
to keep them alive

18:00.497 --> 18:01.790
in the bunker.

18:01.999 --> 18:03.584
But you
will need them

18:03.792 --> 18:05.210
if you go there.

18:05.419 --> 18:07.171
The computer code is
destroying your neurons

18:07.421 --> 18:09.465
at an advanced rate.

18:11.300 --> 18:12.468
Soon you're not
gonna know how to tie

18:12.676 --> 18:14.428
your own shoes,

18:14.636 --> 18:16.430
let alone
how to convert

18:16.638 --> 18:19.475
a launch entry suit
into something

18:20.267 --> 18:22.061
that you can
spacewalk in.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.692
You can help me
spacewalk?

18:29.151 --> 18:30.986
If you're
gonna go out,

18:31.195 --> 18:32.821
might as well
go out with a view.

18:37.201 --> 18:38.952
Come on, come back.

18:39.203 --> 18:40.496
I'm good to go again.

18:44.625 --> 18:47.211
Your friend Miller
should be back by now.

19:00.724 --> 19:02.601
They're not
coming back, John.

19:06.688 --> 19:08.857
So we go to
Polis ourselves.

19:09.066 --> 19:10.901
The boat's on the wrong
side of the water.

19:11.110 --> 19:12.361
We'll never make it.

19:17.533 --> 19:18.534
Then I guess we
ride out the storm

19:18.742 --> 19:20.035
in the lighthouse bunker.

19:21.578 --> 19:22.913
For 5 years?

19:24.665 --> 19:26.083
We'll starve.

19:26.250 --> 19:27.126
Who needs food
when you have

19:27.334 --> 19:28.710
love, right?

19:51.483 --> 19:53.318
We were
searched outside.

19:53.527 --> 19:54.945
If I'm not back in an hour,

19:55.154 --> 19:56.530
my army will attack.

20:09.293 --> 20:10.752
You must be gaia.

20:11.503 --> 20:13.547
- I'm--
- I know who you are...

20:18.635 --> 20:19.553
Wanheda.

20:21.346 --> 20:23.265
You helped my people
find the bunker.

20:23.974 --> 20:24.600
Thank you for that.

20:24.808 --> 20:26.185
And you gave the flame

20:26.393 --> 20:28.979
to an unworthy king,
who saw it destroyed.

20:30.898 --> 20:32.691
I am not as grateful.

20:35.194 --> 20:36.820
Let's see what all
the fuss is about.

20:48.874 --> 20:50.250
After you,
Wanheda.

21:25.661 --> 21:27.913
All my enemies
in one place.

21:28.121 --> 21:29.164
Who are they?

21:29.414 --> 21:31.750
The war chiefs of
the Trikru alliance.

21:31.959 --> 21:33.710
She was supposed
to be alone.

21:33.919 --> 21:35.128
What fun
would that be?

21:36.463 --> 21:38.006
You murdered
our people.

21:38.215 --> 21:39.716
You burned
our villages.

21:39.925 --> 21:40.801
Yet you have the nerve
to come here

21:41.051 --> 21:42.219
in the name of peace.

21:42.427 --> 21:44.388
Not peace. Survival.

21:44.596 --> 21:46.556
You tried to take
this bunker for yourself,

21:46.765 --> 21:49.393
yet here I am,
willing to talk.

21:49.601 --> 21:51.228
The Trikru alliance
holds the temple.

21:51.395 --> 21:52.771
Of course you're
willing to talk.

21:52.980 --> 21:53.897
And the Azgeda alliance

21:54.106 --> 21:55.357
surrounds it.

21:55.565 --> 21:56.358
None of your people
will get inside

21:56.566 --> 21:57.567
unless we come to terms.

21:57.776 --> 21:59.194
This war is inevitable.

22:00.320 --> 22:01.989
The only reason
it hasn't happened
before now

22:02.197 --> 22:03.615
is that Lexa
commanded it.

22:03.824 --> 22:06.451
The only thing that's
inevitable is Praimfaya.

22:06.910 --> 22:07.786
In 6 days,

22:07.995 --> 22:10.956
anyone who is not in
this bunker will be dead.

22:11.164 --> 22:12.374
Then we should
get to it.

22:13.500 --> 22:14.751
Roan.

22:16.878 --> 22:17.963
We talked.

22:21.049 --> 22:22.551
Now we fight.

22:22.801 --> 22:23.635
No.

22:24.303 --> 22:27.472
There is room
for 1,200 people
in here.

22:28.849 --> 22:30.684
We could
share it equally.

22:31.351 --> 22:32.978
All of the clans
can survive.

22:34.396 --> 22:36.315
That's what Lexa
would have wanted.

22:38.150 --> 22:40.235
You're right.
She would have.

22:40.861 --> 22:42.404
And if she were
here, the clans

22:42.612 --> 22:44.323
might actually
have obeyed her.

22:44.531 --> 22:46.158
But seeing that
there's no commander
to rule us...

22:48.327 --> 22:49.453
War it is.

23:11.308 --> 23:12.267
What are you
doing?

23:12.517 --> 23:13.977
I know you have
the flame.

23:14.978 --> 23:16.688
I know Octavia
gave it to you.

23:16.897 --> 23:18.023
I think you should
leave, Clarke.

23:18.231 --> 23:19.900
I can't let them
fight a war over

23:20.108 --> 23:21.777
the one thing
that can save us.

23:21.985 --> 23:23.487
Not even Wanheda
can stop the clans

23:23.695 --> 23:24.780
from killing
each other.

23:24.988 --> 23:27.366
No. But a commander could.

23:29.117 --> 23:31.244
Of course
a commander could.

23:32.454 --> 23:34.539
Unfortunately, we need
a Natblida for that.

23:49.888 --> 23:51.223
Make me the commander.

24:16.915 --> 24:18.834
Ahh. It's jammed.

24:19.042 --> 24:20.085
Same as the others.

24:20.293 --> 24:21.294
But this is
the door to blow.

24:21.503 --> 24:22.879
How many gas canisters
do we have?

24:23.547 --> 24:24.381
You can't
be serious.

24:24.589 --> 24:25.424
In mount weather,
we beat the gas

24:25.632 --> 24:26.716
by using water.

24:26.925 --> 24:28.301
Jasper will be
ready for that.

24:28.510 --> 24:30.220
Just slow down.
Let me talk to them.

24:30.429 --> 24:31.680
Bellamy, we have
over 400 people

24:31.888 --> 24:32.973
ready to march.

24:42.065 --> 24:43.066
Gun.

24:43.859 --> 24:44.776
Harper's.

24:44.985 --> 24:46.319
How many more
of them are armed?

24:46.528 --> 24:47.779
I don't know. A few.

24:49.281 --> 24:51.116
"DNR"?

24:51.324 --> 24:52.909
Do not
resuscitate.

24:56.121 --> 24:58.248
Jasper, put down
the gun.

24:58.457 --> 24:59.708
Open the door.

25:02.169 --> 25:03.170
We're not coming out.

25:03.336 --> 25:04.421
This is insane.

25:06.089 --> 25:07.132
Are you really
willing to die,

25:07.340 --> 25:08.425
when there's
a way to live?

25:08.967 --> 25:09.593
Are they?

25:09.801 --> 25:10.969
That's just it.
We don't think

25:11.178 --> 25:12.179
it's a way to live.

25:12.387 --> 25:14.681
Just go. Please.

25:16.308 --> 25:17.893
We're wasting time.
Set the charge.

25:21.521 --> 25:22.397
You can go to guns.

25:22.647 --> 25:24.232
Do not fire
unless fired upon.

25:24.441 --> 25:25.358
Is that clear?

25:25.567 --> 25:26.485
No. OK, just--
just wait.

25:28.653 --> 25:30.197
Jasper, people
will get hurt.

25:30.405 --> 25:31.656
I know you care
about that.

25:35.702 --> 25:37.454
If you don't want
anyone to get hurt,

25:38.455 --> 25:39.623
don't open the door.

25:47.380 --> 25:48.632
We're all set.
We should clear the hall.

25:55.388 --> 25:57.057
Mr. Jordan,

25:57.390 --> 25:59.601
I will not leave
children here to die.

26:00.352 --> 26:02.604
You sent them
down to die.

26:04.731 --> 26:06.191
The difference now

26:06.399 --> 26:07.901
is that they
have a choice.

26:08.568 --> 26:09.861
And so do you.

26:10.612 --> 26:11.780
What are you
talking about?

26:14.241 --> 26:15.534
This is what they want.

26:15.742 --> 26:17.536
They're wasted.
They don't know
what they want.

26:30.590 --> 26:31.508
Stand down.

26:38.223 --> 26:39.224
Get ready to move out.

26:39.432 --> 26:41.059
- Yes, sir.
- What?

26:41.268 --> 26:42.394
No. You can't.

26:44.646 --> 26:46.815
I'm sorry, son.
Bellamy is right.

26:47.649 --> 26:48.525
We can't save them
if they don't

26:48.733 --> 26:49.734
want to be saved.

26:57.742 --> 26:59.411
If Octavia
was in there,

27:00.412 --> 27:02.330
would you
let her stay?

27:02.539 --> 27:04.124
If Octavia
was in there...

27:05.709 --> 27:07.627
At least I'd get
to say good-bye.

27:33.320 --> 27:34.946
That's it,
isn't it?

27:35.155 --> 27:36.406
Skairipa.

27:40.285 --> 27:41.911
I saw you
in Polis.

27:44.122 --> 27:46.124
You murdered
my friend Terro.

27:47.167 --> 27:48.668
Cut off his head.

27:50.211 --> 27:51.421
I'm not that
person anymore.

27:51.838 --> 27:52.922
Uhh!

27:53.131 --> 27:54.132
Please.

27:54.716 --> 27:56.009
You don't want
to do this.

27:56.217 --> 27:57.344
Uhh!

27:57.552 --> 28:00.597
Trust me.
Just walk away.

28:21.576 --> 28:23.495
Aah! Uhh!

28:39.886 --> 28:43.264
Aah! Aah!

28:59.739 --> 29:01.116
This is who I am.

29:19.008 --> 29:20.844
Once reinforcements
arrive, we can edge in west

29:21.052 --> 29:22.512
to the temple quarter.

29:22.762 --> 29:24.013
No.
There's no time.

29:24.222 --> 29:26.307
We need to squeeze out
Boudalankru first.

29:26.516 --> 29:28.143
Here and here.

29:32.147 --> 29:33.565
The ascension call.

29:39.154 --> 29:40.530
The flame
was destroyed.

29:40.739 --> 29:42.198
How is this
possible?

29:43.700 --> 29:45.326
You said
you saw it.

29:45.535 --> 29:46.828
It was shattered.

29:49.748 --> 29:51.833
I saw what they
wanted me to see.

29:52.917 --> 29:55.295
A new commander is
bad for us, Roan.

29:56.171 --> 29:57.589
But we control
the tower.

29:58.548 --> 30:00.133
Let me stop
this ascension,

30:00.800 --> 30:03.011
at least until
we know who
the Natblida is.

30:04.512 --> 30:06.264
I know who it is.

30:25.325 --> 30:26.993
Are you presiding?

30:27.494 --> 30:28.369
Yes.

30:28.703 --> 30:30.830
The flame chose me
as its protector.

30:31.039 --> 30:32.707
Our scouts
honor that.

30:32.957 --> 30:34.209
Did one of them
find a Natblida?

30:34.417 --> 30:35.251
Obviously.

30:35.460 --> 30:36.878
What clan
are they from?

30:37.587 --> 30:38.755
This is highly
unusual, gaia.

30:38.963 --> 30:40.215
There was no conclave.

30:40.423 --> 30:42.133
There are questions
to be answered.

31:16.543 --> 31:19.963
What is this?
Wanheda is no Natblida!

32:11.806 --> 32:14.142
Ascende...

32:16.436 --> 32:18.271
Lies upon lies.

32:22.692 --> 32:24.277
Get out of this
sacred circle.

32:24.485 --> 32:26.487
There's nothing sacred
about any of this.

32:26.654 --> 32:28.865
Wanheda is making
a mockery of our faith.

32:31.200 --> 32:33.161
I'm trying to save us,
your highness.

32:33.536 --> 32:34.370
You know that.

32:34.621 --> 32:35.538
Because you think
we're savages

32:35.747 --> 32:36.873
in need of saving?

32:37.081 --> 32:39.083
Praimfaya is
almost here.

32:39.292 --> 32:40.877
Then let's not
waste any more time.

32:41.669 --> 32:43.171
Bring in the healer!

32:47.425 --> 32:48.801
What are you doing?

32:49.010 --> 32:50.261
We don't know
if this works.

32:50.470 --> 32:51.554
The flame
could kill you.

32:51.763 --> 32:52.680
I have no choice.

32:52.889 --> 32:53.806
Tell them, healer.

32:54.474 --> 32:55.516
Go on,
tell them all

32:55.725 --> 32:56.893
how it is
your daughter

32:57.101 --> 32:58.686
became
a Natblida.

33:02.523 --> 33:03.483
Through science.

33:09.030 --> 33:11.324
You made her
a Nightblood?

33:11.950 --> 33:12.909
Yes.

33:13.785 --> 33:15.495
If anyone
can be a Natblida,

33:15.703 --> 33:17.163
if anyone can
take the flame,

33:17.372 --> 33:19.791
then we can no longer
trust the blood.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.962
What we can
still trust is the sword.

33:25.463 --> 33:27.840
We've delayed this war
long enough.

33:28.174 --> 33:28.925
Wait.

33:34.889 --> 33:36.599
Wanheda is right
about one thing.

33:38.393 --> 33:40.186
Fighting a war is
a bad way to decide

33:40.395 --> 33:41.688
who gets
to survive.

33:44.691 --> 33:47.068
You summoned all your scouts
here for an ascension,

33:47.485 --> 33:49.028
but you left out
the best part.

33:50.238 --> 33:51.364
A conclave.

33:51.864 --> 33:53.491
A final conclave.

33:53.950 --> 33:56.035
One champion per clan.

33:56.244 --> 33:58.997
One death
instead of thousands.

33:59.539 --> 34:02.625
And whoever wins
gets the bunker.

34:20.018 --> 34:23.187
Will you fight,
or will you burn?

34:33.948 --> 34:36.242
Remember, it's not black rain,
but it can turn at any moment.

34:36.451 --> 34:38.202
So keep the person with
your assigned chem tent

34:38.411 --> 34:39.662
in sight at all times.

34:40.371 --> 34:43.332
"No one but us
saves ourselves.

34:44.375 --> 34:46.669
We ourselves
must walk the path."

35:00.683 --> 35:02.143
Not too late
to change your mind.

35:02.351 --> 35:03.519
Yes, it is.

35:06.105 --> 35:07.565
You can still
stay, you know?

35:08.566 --> 35:10.276
I'm not a quitter.

35:11.069 --> 35:12.278
Thanks for
understanding.

35:15.531 --> 35:16.741
Where's Monty?

35:17.825 --> 35:18.951
Unloading the rover.

35:19.160 --> 35:21.245
We're leaving it
behind for you,
by the way.

35:21.954 --> 35:23.581
He didn't
say good-bye?

35:28.086 --> 35:29.587
Take care of him
for us, will you?

35:32.215 --> 35:33.466
You know I will.

35:47.230 --> 35:48.481
May we meet again.

35:51.400 --> 35:52.401
We won't.

35:58.032 --> 35:59.617

you guys change yours.

Always

We'll bring this stuff
to the lighthouse,

37:16.611 --> 37:17.862
see what else we can
find on the island.

37:27.997 --> 37:29.165
You guys ready
or what?

37:29.415 --> 37:31.459
Sorry we're late.
There's been
some developments.

37:31.667 --> 37:32.752
Not all good.
They've--

37:32.960 --> 37:34.170
fill you in
on the way.

37:35.796 --> 37:37.465
Is this everything
we need?

37:37.715 --> 37:38.841
- Yeah.
- Great. We got it.

37:39.050 --> 37:39.759
Go get Raven.

37:40.134 --> 37:41.052
Don't have
much time.

37:41.677 --> 37:43.512
Mass fiery death
in 5 days.

37:59.779 --> 38:00.821
Raven.

38:01.405 --> 38:02.865
Little busy here.

38:03.074 --> 38:04.325
Yeah, well,
whatever's not packed,

38:04.533 --> 38:05.159
you need to leave it.

38:05.368 --> 38:06.285
It's time to go.

38:07.745 --> 38:08.996
I'm not going.

38:10.498 --> 38:12.333
What the hell are
you talking about?

38:14.502 --> 38:16.462
I'm dying, Murphy.

38:19.131 --> 38:20.633
Come on. Abby said
if you didn't use
your brain, we--

38:20.841 --> 38:22.426
we're past that now.

38:35.147 --> 38:36.899
You're going
to space?

38:41.654 --> 38:42.905
Have any idea
what it feels like

38:43.114 --> 38:44.824
to be in pain every day?

38:47.201 --> 38:48.661
When I was spacewalking,

38:50.663 --> 38:52.123
everything was right.

38:55.167 --> 38:56.877
I just want that again.

38:59.005 --> 39:00.214
I'm sorry.

39:04.093 --> 39:06.512
I'm sorry for doing
this to you, Raven.

39:11.017 --> 39:13.019
This is not
your fault, Murphy.

39:14.312 --> 39:15.855
I could deal with
losing my leg,

39:16.063 --> 39:20.109
but...Losing my mind...

39:28.659 --> 39:30.077
What do you want me
to tell the others?

39:32.496 --> 39:33.748
Tell them...

39:39.170 --> 39:41.255
Tell them
I floated myself.

39:57.313 --> 40:01.025
Go. Survive. Heh.

40:02.151 --> 40:04.153
It's what cockroaches
do, right?

40:10.201 --> 40:11.744
Can we please
get back to work?

40:11.952 --> 40:14.038
Yeah. Yeah,
OK, sorry.

40:14.246 --> 40:15.915
Right.
Where were we?

40:41.065 --> 40:43.442
The entire city
is the battlefield.

40:44.819 --> 40:47.321
No time limit.
No guns.

40:48.155 --> 40:49.657
One warrior from
each clan fights

40:49.865 --> 40:51.617
until only one remains.

40:52.618 --> 40:54.703
And the winner's clan
takes the bunker.

40:55.246 --> 40:56.414
Just like that.

41:00.835 --> 41:02.169
Without guns

41:02.378 --> 41:04.964
and without anyone trained
in grounder combat,

41:06.882 --> 41:08.384
there's no way
we can win.

41:10.094 --> 41:13.764
Hey, we fight or we die.

41:45.421 --> 41:46.714
I'm here for the war.
