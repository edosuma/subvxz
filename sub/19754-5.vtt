WEBVTT

00:01.897 --> 00:04.174
- Why here?
- It's quiet,

00:05.023 --> 00:06.120
and, uh, every few months,

00:06.126 --> 00:07.985
they dump truckloads of
new silt from the bay.

00:08.453 --> 00:10.972
So you bury something here,
it gets buried again and again.

00:11.309 --> 00:12.309
Yeah.

00:12.320 --> 00:13.420
Why'd you move him?

00:15.713 --> 00:17.034
You questioned me.

00:17.913 --> 00:19.233
You were right about some things,

00:19.828 --> 00:21.005
and I got scared.

00:21.865 --> 00:23.476
So you went to Pernell Harris for help.

00:23.586 --> 00:26.386
No. I did it all by myself.

00:26.389 --> 00:29.475
I dug up Shane, and I put
him in Julio Farkas' backyard.

00:29.481 --> 00:31.281
- You're lying, Keith.
- No.

00:31.561 --> 00:33.290
You're lying. You
couldn't have done that.

00:33.544 --> 00:35.108
We had people watching you.

00:37.017 --> 00:38.492
You went to that church,

00:38.501 --> 00:39.757
and you stayed in that church.

00:39.884 --> 00:41.439
Pernell moved Shane's body.

00:41.566 --> 00:43.021
- No.
- Dumped it at Julio's.

00:43.140 --> 00:44.680
No. It was me.

00:45.289 --> 00:46.656
It was only me.

00:50.020 --> 00:52.425
It's a straight shot from the
kill site to the dump site.

00:54.207 --> 00:55.479
I don't know about that.

00:56.173 --> 00:59.019
I'd take the 580 to the
4, get off on Maricopa.

00:59.769 --> 01:00.809
You would?

01:01.457 --> 01:03.559
Even with the little express lane camera

01:03.593 --> 01:05.033
snapping shots of you every 2 miles?

01:07.296 --> 01:09.456
Come on. There's a couple
places he could have stopped.

01:10.835 --> 01:13.188
Mike Alcala said it
was an older white guy

01:13.301 --> 01:14.839
with gray hair, goatee.

01:15.471 --> 01:16.584
That doesn't sound like you.

01:16.589 --> 01:17.749
Why would he lie?

01:18.207 --> 01:19.861
I wouldn't say anybody's lying.

01:20.196 --> 01:22.466
Sometimes people get things wrong.

01:22.712 --> 01:24.153
Is that why you tried to kill him?

01:24.987 --> 01:26.566
I only know about Shane.

01:28.068 --> 01:29.068
Right.

01:29.466 --> 01:30.466
Shane.

01:31.296 --> 01:32.436
He was a good one.

Hey, uh, these cameras, do they work,

02:26.259 --> 02:27.714
or are they just for show?

02:28.200 --> 02:29.507
Of course they work.

02:34.284 --> 02:36.038
How many times did you stab him?

02:36.765 --> 02:37.891
Four or five.

02:38.067 --> 02:38.908
Where?

02:38.980 --> 02:41.027
The leg. Femoral artery.

02:41.154 --> 02:42.273
Why bleed him out?

02:42.654 --> 02:44.574
Why not just slit his
throat and be done with it?

02:45.812 --> 02:47.798
I wanted him to have time for salvation.

02:47.800 --> 02:50.324
Salvation for what? Oh, that's right.

02:50.889 --> 02:51.903
You're born again.

02:52.149 --> 02:54.905
How does murder work
with being a born-again Christian?

02:55.624 --> 02:56.842
I'm not perfect.

02:56.918 --> 02:58.111
None of us are.

02:58.703 --> 02:59.873
What about lying?

03:00.512 --> 03:02.141
Is that okay for a good Christian boy?

03:02.377 --> 03:03.574
I'm not lying.

03:03.664 --> 03:05.394
You know what this looks like, Keith?

03:06.187 --> 03:08.644
It looks like you're
covering for Pernell Harris.

03:09.346 --> 03:11.550
You tried to kill the
only witness against him,

03:11.556 --> 03:12.762
and that didn't work,

03:12.922 --> 03:14.352
and this is your last resort.

03:14.979 --> 03:16.511
If you were a good Christian boy,

03:16.517 --> 03:18.146
you'd tell me the truth right now.

03:18.265 --> 03:21.734
I murdered Shane, and I need to pay.

03:21.822 --> 03:24.030
But killing a cop
means the death penalty.

03:26.387 --> 03:29.157
Uh... that sounds fair.

03:30.168 --> 03:31.637
Sacrifice.

03:31.757 --> 03:33.394
That's very Christian.

03:50.369 --> 03:51.369
Get up.

03:56.265 --> 03:57.786
Thank you for your time, Mr. Dennison.

03:57.792 --> 03:58.690
You're free to go.

03:58.696 --> 04:00.468
No, no. I killed Shane.

04:00.474 --> 04:01.484
No, I don't think so.

04:01.565 --> 04:03.200
I think we got the right guy.

04:03.360 --> 04:04.393
Thank you for your time.

04:04.399 --> 04:05.608
- Wait!
- Hey!

04:05.609 --> 04:08.054
Aah! My God! Uhh!

04:08.364 --> 04:10.807
That fucking cop begged me for his life!

04:10.925 --> 04:13.022
He cried for his babies!

04:13.603 --> 04:15.661
I bled him slow! I laughed!

04:15.667 --> 04:16.757
Get him the fuck out of here.

04:16.762 --> 04:18.003
- No!
- Get up.

04:18.009 --> 04:19.375
I killed him!

05:19.698 --> 05:21.351
Welcome back, Bay Area.

05:21.357 --> 05:23.796
Well, the focus in the
Shane Caldwell murder case

05:23.802 --> 05:28.296
has been all about privileged
1%-er Judge Pernell Harris,

05:28.542 --> 05:31.398
but I say enough about
the alleged perpetrator.

05:31.723 --> 05:34.362
Let's talk about the family for once...

05:34.496 --> 05:37.635
slain officer Shane Caldwell's family.

05:38.884 --> 05:39.884
Heather,

05:40.986 --> 05:42.608
how are you and the kids doing?

05:42.997 --> 05:45.681
We're doing okay, I guess.

05:47.663 --> 05:50.853
My kids knew that their
daddy had a dangerous job.

05:51.536 --> 05:54.532
Do you think Judge Harris
killed your husband?

05:55.518 --> 05:58.697
I just want whoever did this to pay.

05:59.261 --> 06:01.714
You must miss Shane terribly.

06:04.028 --> 06:06.469
When I lost Owen, I was inconsolable.

06:06.635 --> 06:08.205
I clung to little things.

06:08.214 --> 06:11.224
For months, I sprayed
his cologne on my pillow.

06:12.186 --> 06:13.825
I wear Shane's ring.

06:14.436 --> 06:17.272
I put it on after they
brought him home to me.

06:24.151 --> 06:25.621
We need to talk, Pernell.

06:29.502 --> 06:31.362
Crys, hey.

06:32.305 --> 06:33.435
Why don't you sit down?

06:33.439 --> 06:35.179
We need to strategize.

06:35.203 --> 06:38.431
Sweetheart, I don't want you
worrying about this trial.

06:38.437 --> 06:39.677
It's not about the trial.

06:40.016 --> 06:42.414
It's what we do after you're convicted.

06:43.339 --> 06:45.815
Hang on. Nobody's getting convicted.

06:46.422 --> 06:49.115
I need to plan for a
future without you, Pernell.

06:50.206 --> 06:51.326
What the fuck are you doing?

06:52.087 --> 06:53.657
Nick can help me do that.

06:58.506 --> 07:00.724
Get the fuck off my wife.

07:02.510 --> 07:03.510
Come on, Pernell.

07:04.670 --> 07:07.010
How do you think I got
him to take your case?

07:07.133 --> 07:08.865
Harder.

07:09.973 --> 07:11.883
- Uhh!
- Don't stop.

07:17.850 --> 07:18.852
Crys!

07:20.028 --> 07:21.247
Pernell. Judge Harris.

07:21.254 --> 07:22.441
Are you with me?

07:28.011 --> 07:29.114
Oh, doc.

07:30.663 --> 07:32.144
You got to make these stop.

07:32.183 --> 07:35.005
- Yeah. Who were you talking to?
- Nobody.

07:35.965 --> 07:37.385
It doesn't matter.

07:40.296 --> 07:43.006
But I was paralyzed. Couldn't move.

07:43.316 --> 07:46.573
You couldn't move in the vision
or in reality?

07:46.579 --> 07:47.579
Both.

07:48.863 --> 07:50.781
It happened to me yesterday, too.

07:50.857 --> 07:52.523
So these are ongoing.

07:54.036 --> 07:55.337
You have a hunch.

07:56.242 --> 07:57.417
Spit it out.

07:58.919 --> 08:01.284
Well, fluctuating coherence,

08:01.550 --> 08:04.835
waking hallucinations,
muscular rigidity.

08:05.291 --> 08:08.503
These are all symptoms
to Lewy Body Dementia.

08:11.942 --> 08:13.812
Does that ring a bell?

08:15.007 --> 08:16.637
I sent somebody to prison.

08:20.688 --> 08:22.776
Murdered four people in cold blood.

08:24.534 --> 08:27.554
His lawyer said he had that Lewy Body.

08:28.776 --> 08:30.213
Tried to plead insanity.

08:30.407 --> 08:32.126
If that's what it is,
there's a cure, right?

08:32.162 --> 08:35.032
There's no cure, just drug therapy.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.039
Okay, what drugs?

08:38.333 --> 08:40.553
Now, first we need to
confirm the diagnosis.

08:40.607 --> 08:42.537
I don't want to spend
any extra time on this.

08:42.538 --> 08:44.302
Why don't we just go
right into the therapy?

08:44.359 --> 08:45.381
Yes.

08:47.567 --> 08:51.342
I found my father laid out
on the floor of the kitchen,

08:51.344 --> 08:53.397
j-just like you were a minute ago.

08:53.635 --> 08:56.606
The whole right side of
his body was paralyzed.

08:57.173 --> 08:58.771
I thought he had a stroke.

08:59.636 --> 09:02.933
Nope. Pinched sciatic nerve.

09:03.481 --> 09:05.786
First we do the tests.

09:17.136 --> 09:19.898
Coming up, how high
up does one have to be

09:19.904 --> 09:21.827
on the City Council's food chain

09:21.833 --> 09:23.761
to make society look the other way?

09:23.960 --> 09:26.554
Special correspondent Yasmin Florenoy

09:26.560 --> 09:29.272
has a story that'll make
you count down the days

09:29.278 --> 09:30.968
to the next municipal election.

09:35.355 --> 09:37.295
- You lied to me.
- Jesus Christ.

09:37.922 --> 09:39.693
What the fuck are you doing in my house?

09:39.694 --> 09:41.719
What the fuck are you doing in my life?

09:41.965 --> 09:44.181
Someone took a shot
at me because of you.

09:44.407 --> 09:46.092
I'm looking for my son's program.

09:46.098 --> 09:47.143
Bathwater?

09:47.445 --> 09:49.894
Sure... here you go.

09:52.063 --> 09:53.778
Anne Wu gave you that. Why?

09:53.960 --> 09:55.296
She hired me to crack it

09:55.311 --> 09:57.113
and get it ready for the market.

10:01.869 --> 10:04.942
Wait. PJ wanted to distribute this free.

10:04.948 --> 10:06.288
How do I do that?

10:12.312 --> 10:13.431
He did?

10:15.366 --> 10:16.927
That's why he wouldn't sell it to Anne.

10:17.881 --> 10:21.116
He used his encryption key
to access the source code.

10:21.228 --> 10:23.493
Upload that into the
web. Doesn't matter where.

10:23.499 --> 10:25.848
Just put PJ's name on it, and
the right people will find it.

10:25.853 --> 10:27.703
I'm not even sure I know
what you're talking about.

10:27.708 --> 10:29.096
The encryption key is like a password.

10:29.101 --> 10:31.025
The source code is like
gibberish without it.

10:31.031 --> 10:32.176
With it, it's Bathwater.

10:32.177 --> 10:33.447
Did Anne have the key?

10:33.660 --> 10:36.383
If she does,
it's probably at Brooks Innovations.

10:37.443 --> 10:39.372
I'll pay you to help
me get the key back.

10:40.716 --> 10:42.488
Can't spend money if I'm dead.

10:43.696 --> 10:44.839
Then don't die.

10:54.088 --> 10:55.093
Jocelyn?

10:55.520 --> 10:56.703
Jocelyn!

10:57.179 --> 10:58.520
Jocelyn!

11:04.711 --> 11:07.316
- Oh.
- Asa, I'm fine.

11:07.878 --> 11:09.699
- You scared me.
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

11:09.705 --> 11:12.052
Don't be scaring a black
person like that, J.

11:17.651 --> 11:19.116
My therapist asked me to do this

11:19.122 --> 11:20.297
before our session today.

11:20.757 --> 11:22.849
How much do you pay
this damn shrink again?

11:24.279 --> 11:26.162
It's really not as insane as it sounds.

11:26.844 --> 11:30.062
It's... exposure therapy.

11:30.594 --> 11:32.217
She says that, um,

11:33.071 --> 11:36.307
if I can get through
talking about the assault,

11:36.308 --> 11:40.809
then it'll just become
another story and not a scar.

11:43.159 --> 11:44.850
Oh, shit. I'm sorry. Is that, uh...

11:44.937 --> 11:46.217
Genuine alligator.

11:46.218 --> 11:48.203
They swim, right?

11:48.774 --> 11:52.205
So do you have, like,
a bad juju about water?

11:52.466 --> 11:53.472
Yeah.

11:54.353 --> 11:56.625
I did. I almost drowned
when I was a kid.

11:57.434 --> 11:59.403
I lost consciousness and everything.

12:00.450 --> 12:02.315
You want to tell me the happy ending?

12:03.731 --> 12:07.503
My dad bought me a set of water wings,

12:07.509 --> 12:09.344
and he said that they were magic.

12:09.709 --> 12:11.106
And, uh...

12:11.963 --> 12:14.288
that was it. I was in
the water all summer.

12:14.774 --> 12:16.593
PJ would have called that a hack.

12:17.266 --> 12:18.266
You're right.

12:18.279 --> 12:20.130
But how does it help you with the...

12:21.378 --> 12:22.432
The rape?

12:22.644 --> 12:23.644
Rape.

12:23.973 --> 12:25.407
You can call it that.

12:26.677 --> 12:28.191
That's... That's what it was.

12:29.469 --> 12:32.229
Yeah, magic water wings for rape.

12:32.235 --> 12:35.457
I don't... I don't know. I'm trying
to figure that one out myself.

12:40.505 --> 12:42.999
That fucking psychopath Keith Dennison?

12:43.005 --> 12:44.332
You just let him walk?

12:44.595 --> 12:46.695
You don't kick any confession

12:46.698 --> 12:47.928
without calling me first.

12:47.932 --> 12:49.872
- That was a sure thing.
- Was it?

12:50.212 --> 12:52.030
Come on, Gil. You know how this goes.

12:52.307 --> 12:54.306
You charge one guy. His buddy confesses.

12:54.307 --> 12:56.705
You charge the buddy, they
point fingers at each other.

12:56.708 --> 12:58.210
Boom. Reasonable doubt.

12:58.329 --> 13:01.111
You really want me to pick up
this no-name career criminal?

13:01.168 --> 13:02.368
I'll do it right now.

13:02.374 --> 13:03.580
Don't give me that.

13:03.586 --> 13:04.941
You know exactly what I want:

13:05.082 --> 13:06.786
that arrogant fuck Harris

13:06.889 --> 13:10.287
permanently off the bench
and buried in a super max.

13:10.454 --> 13:12.756
But it's my face on this trial,

13:12.757 --> 13:15.317
and I won't let him embarrass me again.

13:15.555 --> 13:16.898
I wouldn't have let Dennison go

13:16.899 --> 13:18.385
if I didn't have a good reason.

13:18.941 --> 13:20.996
Now come on. My guys found something

13:20.998 --> 13:22.204
that's going to help us out.

13:53.758 --> 13:55.141
Are we going somewhere?

13:55.266 --> 13:57.592
The 77 line is my new temporary housing.

13:58.552 --> 14:00.682
Runs 24 hours, and it's never empty.

14:01.547 --> 14:03.043
Makes it harder to shoot me.

14:06.073 --> 14:07.872
Why does somebody think

14:07.976 --> 14:10.303
PJ's program is worth killing for?

14:11.652 --> 14:13.814
Do you even understand
what Bathwater is?

14:13.951 --> 14:15.387
- What it does?
- Yeah.

14:15.388 --> 14:16.646
It's got something to do

14:16.653 --> 14:19.080
with not being tracked by the Web.

14:19.143 --> 14:21.986
No. What Bathwater
does is randomly poison

14:21.993 --> 14:24.117
the information they collect from you.

14:24.705 --> 14:26.868
One time it's age, then it's gender,

14:26.869 --> 14:28.631
then location, whatever.

14:29.309 --> 14:31.639
And if one piece of
information is tainted,

14:31.640 --> 14:33.205
the data vultures have to throw out

14:33.206 --> 14:34.727
everything they collected:

14:35.418 --> 14:37.139
the baby with the bath water.

14:37.585 --> 14:38.585
Get it?

14:40.076 --> 14:41.226
PJ was clever.

14:41.310 --> 14:43.164
PJ was a fucking anarchist.

14:44.442 --> 14:46.125
So who was shooting at us?

14:46.131 --> 14:47.149
Brooks?

14:48.440 --> 14:51.187
Facebook, Google, Palantir.

14:51.188 --> 14:53.658
I mean, there's a long list of companies

14:53.659 --> 14:55.987
whose main business is
collecting our personal data

14:55.993 --> 14:57.107
and selling it.

14:57.623 --> 14:59.197
If Anne was working for herself,

14:59.198 --> 15:02.393
why would this... this
encryption key be at Brooks?

15:02.834 --> 15:04.679
You'll find something on those servers.

15:05.163 --> 15:06.378
You remember where, right?

15:06.561 --> 15:07.561
Yeah.

15:11.265 --> 15:12.286
Your stop.

15:53.951 --> 16:00.047
Do you remember me when... I was
the judge... in your trial?

16:00.150 --> 16:03.894
Your lawyer said you
had Lewy Body Dementia,

16:03.895 --> 16:05.194
that you were insane,

16:06.408 --> 16:07.757
but I didn't believe it.

16:13.179 --> 16:15.179
I think I might have the same thing.

16:15.824 --> 16:17.183
I wanted to talk to you.

16:18.809 --> 16:20.116
Would you talk to me?

16:20.685 --> 16:21.989
My life depends on it.

16:24.982 --> 16:27.569
I only talk to people
who have been touched.

16:27.950 --> 16:29.156
You been touched?

16:34.093 --> 16:35.388
You have.

16:36.641 --> 16:38.484
He talks to you, doesn't He?

16:42.004 --> 16:42.983
Who?

16:42.989 --> 16:45.441
You know who.

16:51.738 --> 16:53.571
Did He give you a message for me?

16:54.301 --> 16:55.333
No.

16:56.456 --> 16:58.805
He used to whisper to
me through a waitress.

17:03.693 --> 17:05.230
Sometimes animals.

17:08.309 --> 17:09.892
I have visions...

17:12.376 --> 17:13.931
through my dead son.

17:18.471 --> 17:19.883
You're so blessed.

17:21.878 --> 17:24.546
I can't hear Him anymore.

17:25.240 --> 17:26.771
They make me take drugs.

17:27.299 --> 17:29.595
And these drugs, they...

17:30.429 --> 17:31.826
they make it go away.

17:31.832 --> 17:35.306
They say hell is the depravation
of the presence of God,

17:36.776 --> 17:37.894
and they're right.

17:44.856 --> 17:46.275
What do they give you?

17:47.477 --> 17:48.596
Quetiapine.

17:51.547 --> 17:52.756
You're a judge.

17:53.201 --> 17:55.762
Please make them stop.

17:57.314 --> 17:58.314
I...

17:59.515 --> 18:02.289
sincerely wish you the
best of luck, Mr. Brody.

18:03.575 --> 18:05.048
And the spirit

18:05.617 --> 18:07.158
I will put within you

18:07.483 --> 18:09.570
will take away the stony heart

18:09.994 --> 18:11.280
out of your flesh.

18:12.200 --> 18:13.200
Ezekiel.

18:23.700 --> 18:24.774
Please!

18:26.669 --> 18:28.740
Make them stop giving me that poison.

18:29.688 --> 18:31.893
I wanted to be with Him again!

18:34.775 --> 18:35.851
Please.

19:15.266 --> 19:16.539
Ah, fuck.

19:47.368 --> 19:50.386
Okay. Sit down. Roll up your sleeve.

19:50.387 --> 19:52.287
I don't need the test. Just
give me the prescription.

19:52.289 --> 19:54.541
No. Sit down.

19:54.547 --> 19:55.970
God damn it, why?

19:56.454 --> 20:00.086
This drug your asking for,
Quetiapinetiapine,

20:00.419 --> 20:01.966
it's barely in circulation anymore

20:01.967 --> 20:04.595
because it's harmed more
people than it's helped.

20:04.601 --> 20:08.037
So first we confirm the diagnosis.

20:08.038 --> 20:09.534
- Sit.
- It's Lewy Body.

20:09.736 --> 20:12.140
I know it is. I talked
to the guy who had it.

20:12.164 --> 20:13.680
Everything he was describing

20:13.681 --> 20:15.593
is exactly what I was experiencing.

20:15.878 --> 20:17.930
This guy was a cold-blooded killer.

20:17.978 --> 20:19.148
They gave him the drug.

20:19.150 --> 20:20.420
He's sitting around like a pussycat.

20:20.421 --> 20:22.517
If this can fix me, why wait?

20:22.800 --> 20:24.454
So you talked to one guy,

20:24.564 --> 20:26.263
and now you have all the answers?

20:26.374 --> 20:27.736
It's that easy?

20:27.759 --> 20:30.039
Is that the problem? If it's too easy,

20:30.045 --> 20:31.663
it's gonna fuck up the chapter
you want to write about me?

20:31.664 --> 20:33.773
Oh, no. I'm not going to
write a chapter on you.

20:34.185 --> 20:36.704
I'm looking at a whole goddamn book.

20:36.831 --> 20:39.883
And the only thing in
question is the ending.

20:39.938 --> 20:42.905
Do I actually find out
what's wrong with you

20:42.906 --> 20:44.376
and solve your problem,

20:44.377 --> 20:47.675
or do I spit the words "I told you so"

20:47.678 --> 20:51.435
right into the hole
I carve in your brain

20:51.441 --> 20:54.405
after you OD'd on drugs
you never should have taken?

20:54.889 --> 20:58.274
Either way, it's going
to be a great book.

20:58.810 --> 20:59.810
Fuck this.

21:22.799 --> 21:23.799
Nathan?

21:26.103 --> 21:27.103
You wanted to see me?

21:27.254 --> 21:29.471
Yes. Come in.

21:32.214 --> 21:33.349
And close the door.

21:40.426 --> 21:42.864
No. Put that away. You don't need it.

21:47.175 --> 21:48.295
How was your meeting?

21:49.319 --> 21:50.319
Excuse me?

21:50.749 --> 21:52.152
I came by your office earlier.

21:52.158 --> 21:54.158
Your assistant Ariella
said you had a meeting.

21:56.071 --> 21:57.071
Huh.

22:02.254 --> 22:03.686
How did that happen, I wonder.

22:06.658 --> 22:10.103
Oh. Uh, I don't know.

22:10.867 --> 22:11.867
No.

22:13.124 --> 22:14.234
Of course not.

22:16.072 --> 22:17.072
How could you?

22:18.321 --> 22:20.048
You heard of the Japanese honeybee.

22:20.966 --> 22:22.203
Fierce little warriors.

22:23.968 --> 22:25.804
They get attacked by 3-inch hornets,

22:26.043 --> 22:27.741
but the bees know the hornets' weakness:

22:29.393 --> 22:30.393
heat.

22:31.865 --> 22:33.916
The bees swarm the hornet and vibrate,

22:34.162 --> 22:35.317
raising the temperature so high,

22:35.319 --> 22:37.098
their enemy cooks in its own skin.

22:38.349 --> 22:39.971
We are the Japanese honeybee.

22:40.360 --> 22:41.951
Those who don't understand our work,

22:42.773 --> 22:43.916
they're the hornets.

22:47.586 --> 22:48.586
Do you see?

22:52.155 --> 22:53.335
It's beautiful.

22:58.662 --> 23:00.151
The hive takes care of itself.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.078
If even one of us is distracted,

23:03.079 --> 23:04.226
we all become vulnerable.

23:25.984 --> 23:27.171
How can I help you?

23:33.447 --> 23:37.101
Quetiapine is... an unusual request.

23:37.347 --> 23:38.934
What condition are you treating?

23:40.334 --> 23:41.486
Hemorrhoids.

23:42.949 --> 23:43.962
Of course.

23:44.488 --> 23:47.326
Many patients take
comfort in Oxy Contin...

23:47.644 --> 23:49.255
say, 80 milligrams?

23:52.984 --> 23:54.553
Give me what I asked for.

24:00.155 --> 24:01.336
You should know

24:01.672 --> 24:04.640
there's a chance of
stroke, heart attack,

24:04.672 --> 24:06.245
and other complications.

24:08.186 --> 24:09.186
Okay.

24:10.118 --> 24:12.459
Do not deviate from the instructions.

24:12.713 --> 24:15.185
At Garland Hills Clinic,
we value two things:

24:15.952 --> 24:18.383
health and privacy.

24:23.743 --> 24:27.424
When Dr. Magic Pills
is giving dire warnings,

24:27.431 --> 24:29.887
you know you shouldn't
be taking this shit.

24:30.779 --> 24:33.136
He was shot in the
head. Do you know him?

24:34.562 --> 24:36.054
You're the one who bought the paper.

24:37.026 --> 24:38.916
And he was the one asking for you

24:39.099 --> 24:41.910
while you were out
gallivanting in Stockton.

24:44.143 --> 24:46.526
Two tablets twice a
day. You got any water?

24:48.521 --> 24:49.962
Red Bull.

24:50.826 --> 24:52.072
Take it or leave it.

25:15.957 --> 25:17.397
Freeze it right there.

25:18.491 --> 25:19.715
It's not crisp,

25:19.716 --> 25:21.916
but I think I see Judge Pernell Harris

25:21.918 --> 25:25.059
looking like he won first
place in a digging contest.

25:25.591 --> 25:28.280
I'm with District
Attorney Gilbert McCauley.

25:28.391 --> 25:29.729
Thank you for joining us.

25:29.730 --> 25:32.096
It was an invitation
we couldn't turn down.

25:32.097 --> 25:34.195
It's our job, after all,

25:34.197 --> 25:35.865
to keep the people informed.

25:36.295 --> 25:37.533
Mr. McCauley,

25:37.534 --> 25:40.294
that is an awful lot of air fresheners.

25:40.303 --> 25:41.571
Wouldn't you agree?

25:41.572 --> 25:43.906
Well, numbers are relative, Lesley.

25:43.907 --> 25:46.377
To say anything else
would be conjecture.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.345
But the DA's office is in possession

25:48.346 --> 25:49.657
of this video, correct?

25:49.663 --> 25:50.911
Yes, we are.

25:50.917 --> 25:54.001
What we're curious about
is how you came by it.

25:54.079 --> 25:56.393
Trusted and legal sources.

25:56.449 --> 25:58.522
And that's all you're
going to charm out of me.

25:58.744 --> 26:01.488
This gas station is
near where we now know

26:01.492 --> 26:04.161
Officer Shane Caldwell
was killed and buried.

26:04.981 --> 26:06.132
That is correct.

26:06.386 --> 26:08.233
Later, of course, we know

26:08.234 --> 26:11.634
Officer Caldwell's body
was dug up and moved.

26:12.600 --> 26:14.275
That is also correct.

26:14.418 --> 26:16.509
Well, if I was on the
Harris defense team,

26:16.510 --> 26:18.866
I would be praying for a plea bargain.

26:19.136 --> 26:21.836
And if I were you, I'd be
going after the death penalty.

26:22.042 --> 26:25.014
Well, uh, you certainly do have a talent

26:25.015 --> 26:27.015
for looking at things
from both sides, Lesley.

26:27.017 --> 26:29.717
We'll just have to see
what the people think.

26:29.720 --> 26:32.755
In the meantime, Judge
Pernell Harris is still free.

26:33.104 --> 26:35.354
Mr. Harris is entitled to his bail.

26:35.472 --> 26:36.926
Well, of course.

26:37.763 --> 26:41.899
Pernell Harris isn't exactly
Mr. Everyday Average Citizen.

26:42.163 --> 26:44.135
Wouldn't we all like
to be walking around

26:44.136 --> 26:47.394
with millions of dollars
and a pet mayor in our pocket

26:47.403 --> 26:49.605
to handle our indiscretions?

26:50.583 --> 26:53.182
I know how you feel
about the part you played in the deal.

26:53.626 --> 26:56.178
Well, what do your
colleagues at Brooks think?

26:56.369 --> 26:57.433
Ask them.

26:57.782 --> 27:00.028
Well, Guy Guillet just died.

27:00.440 --> 27:02.192
Aneurysm. Instant.

27:02.510 --> 27:05.414
That's why I try to stay in front
of this blood pressure thing.

27:05.918 --> 27:08.672
What about Anne Wu?
I can't seem to get in touch with her.

27:08.678 --> 27:10.565
Brooks fired her. Haven't
heard from her since.

27:10.571 --> 27:12.038
Facebook's dormant.

27:12.044 --> 27:13.574
She's not answering her phone.

27:13.580 --> 27:14.918
I put in a call to her parents.

27:14.924 --> 27:16.904
It's like the woman just fell
off the face of the earth.

27:16.909 --> 27:18.464
Okay, I'm confused.

27:18.544 --> 27:20.082
What type of story are you writing?

27:20.083 --> 27:22.214
Bobo, don't you think this is weird?

27:22.220 --> 27:24.518
One person is dead, and
the other one's missing.

27:24.524 --> 27:26.798
No, I don't think it's weird, and all...

27:27.710 --> 27:29.528
A door closed means private meeting.

27:29.529 --> 27:31.355
Yeah, Dad, have you
been watching the news?

27:34.981 --> 27:36.538
Yeah, okay, enough of the attitude.

27:36.544 --> 27:37.625
Spit it out, Asa.

27:37.631 --> 27:39.788
You need to catch up on
the "Lesley Levay Report."

27:40.105 --> 27:42.374
She's got a video on Pernell
that's not a good look.

27:42.375 --> 27:44.511
- What?
- She went out of her way

27:44.512 --> 27:46.909
to say that Robert
Boston is a teacup poodle

27:46.912 --> 27:48.312
in Pernell Harris' pocket.

27:49.480 --> 27:50.327
Fuck!

27:50.333 --> 27:51.333
Fuck!

27:59.895 --> 28:01.661
It's not your fault, Keith.

28:01.667 --> 28:04.629
It's because of me they
found that video of you.

28:04.731 --> 28:06.575
This was all supposed to stop.

28:06.998 --> 28:09.007
They thought I killed him before.

28:09.801 --> 28:11.365
Why did they let you go?

28:13.759 --> 28:15.536
Son of a bitch Toby.

28:17.002 --> 28:18.661
Trying to railroad me.

28:18.944 --> 28:20.966
He's corrupt. The
whole force is corrupt.

28:22.371 --> 28:23.934
You must hate me.

28:24.668 --> 28:25.740
No.

28:29.539 --> 28:31.167
There's too much goodness in you.

28:33.050 --> 28:34.496
I don't understand.

28:34.560 --> 28:35.560
Son

28:36.616 --> 28:38.273
I don't know anybody

28:38.279 --> 28:40.573
that would have stepped
up like that for me.

28:41.552 --> 28:42.791
I love you...

28:44.135 --> 28:47.221
for trying to make that sacrifice.

28:48.910 --> 28:50.655
You feel okay, Judge Harris?

28:51.276 --> 28:53.030
Go home, okay?

28:54.739 --> 28:56.067
I'll take care of everything.

29:00.371 --> 29:01.969
Don't you worry about anything.

29:27.735 --> 29:29.719
The key isn't anywhere
in the Brooks servers.

29:30.627 --> 29:31.627
We're fucked.

29:32.567 --> 29:33.711
But I'm done looking.

29:34.178 --> 29:36.549
Forget the money. I'm
getting out of town.

29:36.689 --> 29:39.254
Stop pretending you don't give a shit.

29:39.335 --> 29:42.922
My son was in so much
pain, he shot himself,

29:42.928 --> 29:44.316
and I didn't see it coming.

29:45.627 --> 29:48.949
This is the last thing I will
ever be able to do for him.

29:49.663 --> 29:52.397
Anne worked at Brooks
for three fucking years.

29:52.470 --> 29:54.100
There's got to be
something on that server

29:54.105 --> 29:55.105
that can help us.

29:58.096 --> 29:59.096
Apex.

30:00.135 --> 30:01.135
What's Apex?

30:02.013 --> 30:03.643
Anne mentioned it once.

30:03.648 --> 30:04.888
She said that she used it

30:04.889 --> 30:06.702
to get Bathwater in the first place.

30:07.792 --> 30:08.792
Fuck.

30:10.106 --> 30:11.190
If it's not in her office,

30:11.191 --> 30:12.664
it's got to be in her apartment.

30:13.664 --> 30:15.584
Do you really want to
walk into Anne's apartment?

30:30.309 --> 30:31.427
What's going on with you?

30:32.614 --> 30:33.614
I'm good.

30:34.768 --> 30:35.974
How are you, beautiful?

30:36.474 --> 30:38.166
Excuse me, sir. No, they're
in a meeting right now.

30:38.171 --> 30:39.201
No, it...

30:43.093 --> 30:45.776
If you are hiding anything
else, I need to know.

30:45.998 --> 30:48.020
Because it's coming
out. You can count on it.

30:48.026 --> 30:49.106
There is nothing else.

30:49.519 --> 30:51.494
No? So you have a good explanation

30:51.496 --> 30:53.817
- why you were at that gas station.
- Don't go there, Nick.

31:00.946 --> 31:01.946
Well...

31:02.732 --> 31:05.191
this whole case just got
turned inside out, didn't it?

31:07.038 --> 31:09.000
Hey. How's everybody doing?

31:09.444 --> 31:10.627
Like I give a shit.

31:13.045 --> 31:14.268
What is the plan?

31:14.348 --> 31:15.469
We can fix this.

31:16.176 --> 31:18.458
- I can fix this.
- The damage is done.

31:18.459 --> 31:20.189
They have you on video covered in dirt.

31:20.195 --> 31:23.195
You look like you could have
Caldwell's severed head in your van.

31:23.196 --> 31:25.588
Three quarters of the
jury base watches Levay.

31:25.747 --> 31:27.242
They already think you're guilty.

31:27.266 --> 31:29.601
Tramble, I wasn't asking
for an audio replay.

31:30.168 --> 31:31.906
The woman called me Pernell's lap dog

31:31.957 --> 31:33.065
on TV live.

31:33.914 --> 31:35.006
But he can fix that.

31:35.140 --> 31:37.300
The mayor can't be associated with a man

31:37.308 --> 31:38.614
who'll be convicted of murder.

31:38.615 --> 31:40.461
Is that any way to talk
about your godfather?

31:40.744 --> 31:42.244
Come on, come on. Give me a hug.

31:42.584 --> 31:44.516
I filed a request
for a change of venue.

31:44.522 --> 31:46.282
- That's it?
- Yeah. That is it.

31:46.351 --> 31:49.084
Because when you get
blindsided by your own client,

31:49.087 --> 31:50.291
you don't get to go on the attack.

31:50.296 --> 31:51.854
You get to lick your wounds.

31:52.525 --> 31:54.663
You're just fucking
everybody's shit up, aren't you?

31:54.664 --> 31:58.337
Guys, look, someone in
SVPD leaked that footage.

31:58.425 --> 32:00.696
Okay? Source or not,
that's illegal, right?

32:00.698 --> 32:03.311
Let's go after them, and
let's get Levay on libel.

32:03.668 --> 32:04.905
Now you're talking.

32:04.906 --> 32:06.496
It's a PR problem, Bobo.

32:06.619 --> 32:08.089
You need to change the narrative.

32:08.408 --> 32:10.602
Give people another image of Pernell.

32:11.030 --> 32:13.115
I like the way you think, Mrs. Harris.

32:13.511 --> 32:15.874
I'm sorry. So what are you
saying, a press conference?

32:15.919 --> 32:17.117
Or mass hypnosis?

32:17.123 --> 32:18.553
He is not going on camera.

32:18.616 --> 32:20.284
I... I'm good on camera.

32:20.285 --> 32:22.423
No, no, no. A press
conference is too defiant.

32:22.424 --> 32:23.750
It needs to be an interview.

32:23.754 --> 32:25.627
I've already got a
call in to Jeremy Lynch.

32:25.808 --> 32:27.358
How about Lesley Levay?

32:29.379 --> 32:30.478
You hate Lesley Levay.

32:30.484 --> 32:31.796
Yeah, I hate Lesley Levay,

32:31.802 --> 32:33.099
but, I mean, you're right, Crys.

32:33.464 --> 32:35.202
People got to look me in the eye

32:35.203 --> 32:36.759
and let them hear me say I'm innocent.

32:37.568 --> 32:38.831
I am innocent.

32:39.550 --> 32:41.107
That could speak to the audience

32:41.108 --> 32:42.469
that already thinks you're guilty.

32:42.791 --> 32:44.514
Not much to lose with them.

32:44.515 --> 32:46.152
Okay, has everybody gone crazy?

32:46.207 --> 32:48.677
Levay is an expert at making
people lose their shit.

32:48.683 --> 32:50.322
He'll be target practice for her.

32:50.727 --> 32:52.786
I'm telling you, man, I
can hold my own with her.

32:53.262 --> 32:55.428
I'll give the audience
something else to focus on.

32:55.434 --> 32:56.913
Okay, no. Trust me.

32:57.553 --> 32:59.398
We keep giving this man
the benefit of the doubt,

32:59.399 --> 33:00.999
and we keep getting bit in the ass.

33:01.047 --> 33:02.295
I'd feel a lot better

33:02.301 --> 33:04.922
if his loving wife was by his side.

33:12.630 --> 33:13.645
Great idea.

33:14.386 --> 33:16.132
Levay is in. I'm getting details.

33:19.235 --> 33:20.235
Thank you.

33:22.313 --> 33:24.213
I'm pretty sure you
don't want to do this,

33:24.215 --> 33:25.525
so thank you.

33:26.151 --> 33:27.691
I don't hate you, Pernell.

33:28.178 --> 33:29.178
Oh.

33:29.762 --> 33:31.486
Well, I love you, too.

33:31.930 --> 33:33.289
Wait. W-Wait.

33:33.291 --> 33:34.668
I need to ask you something.

33:34.814 --> 33:36.124
And don't lose your shit.

33:36.538 --> 33:37.856
It'll be good practice for you.

33:40.741 --> 33:41.992
When, um...

33:42.741 --> 33:45.064
your guy cleaned up after...

33:47.471 --> 33:49.195
what did he do with Anne's things?

33:50.052 --> 33:51.317
He left them there.

33:53.178 --> 33:55.606
He made sure there was no trace of you
or what happened.

33:57.074 --> 33:58.728
- What about her keys?
- Wait... Whoa.

33:58.733 --> 34:00.082
Why are you asking me this?

34:02.491 --> 34:04.390
Crys, whatever you're
thinking about doing,

34:05.329 --> 34:06.546
don't, okay?

34:06.552 --> 34:07.625
So you still have them.

34:12.536 --> 34:13.536
Where are the keys?

34:18.588 --> 34:21.205
Babe, we have to talk to Mrs. Wexler.

34:21.206 --> 34:22.973
Her dog won't stop barking.

34:29.070 --> 34:31.687
I asked her to keep him in at night.

34:32.683 --> 34:34.687
Oh.

34:54.304 --> 34:55.304
Do you hear that?

34:58.002 --> 34:59.059
Huh.

36:18.906 --> 36:19.906
Joselyn.

36:22.145 --> 36:23.387
Joselyn.

36:24.426 --> 36:25.426
Hey.

36:28.077 --> 36:30.412
Hey. It's over.

36:41.165 --> 36:42.445
I'm sorry.

36:44.999 --> 36:46.034
The...

36:48.240 --> 36:49.564
The dog was barking.

36:49.609 --> 36:51.117
And I remember

36:51.212 --> 36:54.374
that I didn't think I was
getting off that floor.

36:56.671 --> 36:58.743
I remember a ring.

37:01.334 --> 37:03.575
And that I didn't want to die.

37:04.059 --> 37:05.702
And how do you feel now?

37:09.127 --> 37:10.127
I don't know.

37:13.378 --> 37:14.688
I don't know, but I... I...

37:14.689 --> 37:16.681
I... I got through it, didn't I?

37:17.921 --> 37:19.444
- Yes, you did.
- Yeah.

37:20.265 --> 37:21.463
Yes, you did.

37:26.868 --> 37:28.852
We roll in 30 seconds.

37:30.198 --> 37:32.094
- You ready to dive back in?
- Yes.

37:37.402 --> 37:38.772
All right, here we go.

37:38.773 --> 37:40.880
5, 4, 3...

37:42.305 --> 37:44.270
We are back and personal

37:44.356 --> 37:47.038
with Judge Pernell Harris
and his luminous wife.

37:47.367 --> 37:48.944
And I have to thank you, Crystal,

37:48.946 --> 37:50.966
for allowing us a peek at this garden.

37:50.972 --> 37:52.299
Well, any time.

37:53.239 --> 37:56.227
Judge Harris, your story is no secret

37:56.233 --> 37:57.887
to the city of San Vicente,

37:57.888 --> 38:00.260
and it's a pretty tragic one.

38:00.768 --> 38:04.225
Well, I mean,
it may not sell newspapers, but...

38:05.653 --> 38:07.449
we've also had some happy times.

38:07.698 --> 38:09.801
That's very brave of you to say,

38:09.934 --> 38:12.598
especially after the
year your family has had.

38:12.775 --> 38:14.670
Your daughter-in-law
raped,

38:14.672 --> 38:17.128
your son, consumed with
guilt, shoots himself...

38:17.134 --> 38:21.110
I don't think that any
of us can ever truly know

38:21.111 --> 38:26.511
what was... what was
going on inside PJ's... mind

38:26.517 --> 38:27.533
right at that moment...

38:29.035 --> 38:30.195
especially you.

38:30.834 --> 38:31.978
Of course not.

38:33.120 --> 38:34.961
But can you tell me
what you were thinking

38:34.962 --> 38:36.989
when you entered a vicious legal battle

38:36.994 --> 38:38.163
with your son's wife

38:38.164 --> 38:40.022
over the right to keep
him on life support?

38:40.173 --> 38:43.432
We were, uh, holding out hope

38:43.534 --> 38:45.297
that he might wake up.

38:45.476 --> 38:47.336
But despite every doctor

38:47.342 --> 38:49.002
telling you that was impossible,

38:49.006 --> 38:53.109
you still publicly attacked
a rape victim for weeks

38:53.110 --> 38:55.314
before ultimately changing your mind?

39:08.834 --> 39:10.350
Answer the question, Dad.

39:10.948 --> 39:11.987
The truth.

39:29.321 --> 39:30.413
I was wrong,

39:30.842 --> 39:33.724
and when I realized that,
I corrected the situation.

39:34.442 --> 39:36.955
Then is it possible that you were wrong

39:36.956 --> 39:39.554
when you accused the late
officer Shane Caldwell

39:39.557 --> 39:41.032
of raping your
daughter-in-law?

39:41.038 --> 39:44.625
You know, I didn't... kill anyone.

39:46.087 --> 39:49.408
I'm being framed by
the police department.

39:50.395 --> 39:51.395
Framed?

39:52.898 --> 39:53.977
By the cops?

39:54.814 --> 39:57.212
I happen to know that
a suspect has come forth

39:57.218 --> 39:58.872
with a complete confession,

39:58.876 --> 40:00.476
including details that only...

40:00.477 --> 40:01.730
only the killer could know,

40:01.873 --> 40:04.774
and they just set it aside
without a second thought.

40:05.068 --> 40:08.563
There's something terribly
disturbing going on here.

40:08.857 --> 40:10.608
You make it sound like a witch hunt.

40:10.614 --> 40:12.395
Oh, it's worse than
that. It's corruption.

40:12.396 --> 40:14.084
The entire force is rotten.

40:14.275 --> 40:16.560
That's quite an
indictment coming from you.

40:16.699 --> 40:18.161
Can you tell me how you know this?

40:18.502 --> 40:21.053
Well, perhaps you should ask
the man behind the curtain:

40:22.133 --> 40:23.586
Chief Toby Clay.

40:24.907 --> 40:26.248
That's an interview

40:26.577 --> 40:27.932
I would really like to see.

40:36.768 --> 40:37.674
Join me?

40:37.753 --> 40:39.611
No, but go ahead.

40:39.878 --> 40:40.936
You did good.

40:43.434 --> 40:46.369
Was that true what you
said about the police?

40:50.591 --> 40:51.591
I think so.

40:52.873 --> 40:53.873
Hmm.

40:56.665 --> 40:57.685
What else?

40:59.524 --> 41:01.178
You had that look in your eye.

41:03.273 --> 41:07.932
Crys, I swear I'm not
having any visions.

41:09.754 --> 41:11.274
I need Anne's keys.

42:10.507 --> 42:13.784
You know what that poison
does to you, Dad, don't you?

42:16.146 --> 42:17.716
- Turns your heart into stone.
- No.

42:18.042 --> 42:20.820
I-It works. I'm cured.

42:21.352 --> 42:22.447
Cured of what?

42:24.031 --> 42:25.555
God?

42:26.827 --> 42:27.827
Never.

42:46.181 --> 42:48.375
Mr. Harris. Mr. Harris!

42:48.738 --> 42:50.137
Call 911!

42:50.590 --> 42:53.390
Welcome, Bay Area, to a "Levay Report"

42:53.396 --> 42:55.630
exclusive prime time special,

42:55.953 --> 42:58.340
as we get up close and personal

42:58.346 --> 43:00.913
with Judge Pernell Harris
and his wife Crystal.

43:00.982 --> 43:03.245
He's wealthy, he's powerful,

43:03.293 --> 43:05.772
larger than life, and
charged with murder.

43:05.986 --> 43:08.760
She's the flawless,
regal woman at his side

43:08.766 --> 43:10.406
while Judge Pernell Harris

43:10.407 --> 43:13.304
makes a startling accusation of his own:

43:13.352 --> 43:15.284
framed by the cops.

43:15.290 --> 43:17.505
I happen to know that
a suspect has come forth

43:17.507 --> 43:20.514
with a complete confession,
including details that only...

43:20.515 --> 43:21.903
only the killer could know.

43:22.332 --> 43:24.184
We've already talked to the widow.

43:24.239 --> 43:25.692
I wear Shane's ring.

43:26.183 --> 43:28.435
I put it on when they
brought him home to me.

43:28.507 --> 43:31.062
Stay tuned while we talk to the suspect.

44:04.433 --> 44:06.505
That was a parting gift.

44:06.528 --> 44:09.394
Stolen the night Jocelyn was raped.

45:03.172 --> 45:04.172
Crys.

45:11.628 --> 45:13.827
Anne's place is empty.

45:15.068 --> 45:16.491
It was cleaned out.

45:16.994 --> 45:18.394
Somebody knows.

45:18.395 --> 45:19.963
Crys, leave this.

45:20.091 --> 45:21.760
I don't want you getting involved.

45:22.922 --> 45:24.706
They told me about
this drug that you took.

45:24.707 --> 45:26.074
Why are you taking it?

45:27.083 --> 45:28.345
It's for anxiety.

45:28.809 --> 45:30.389
Been a rough couple of weeks.

45:31.087 --> 45:32.420
I thought it would help.

45:33.669 --> 45:34.701
I want to...

45:36.513 --> 45:38.735
I'm try... I'm trying
to get better, Crys.

45:40.294 --> 45:41.828
I want to get better for you.

45:44.903 --> 45:46.371
I see how hard you're trying.

45:56.907 --> 45:57.907
I do.

46:11.040 --> 46:12.070
Crystal.

46:14.919 --> 46:16.212
I... I need to talk to him.

46:16.792 --> 46:18.776
Oh, uh, he's... he's asleep.

46:20.053 --> 46:21.053
What is it?

46:22.387 --> 46:23.481
Can you tell me?

46:26.320 --> 46:27.320
Um...

46:33.025 --> 46:34.385
he was right all along.

46:35.465 --> 46:37.104
Shane Caldwell raped me.

46:43.187 --> 46:44.187
You're sure?

46:45.461 --> 46:46.461
Yeah.

46:47.438 --> 46:49.695
And I... I was going to drop it.

46:50.589 --> 46:53.394
I wasn't going to ask
anymore about the book

46:53.395 --> 46:55.590
or why PJ called Pernell last

46:55.592 --> 46:56.792
before he shot himself.

46:56.793 --> 46:59.458
But now I... I need to know.

47:00.514 --> 47:01.553
Is there more?

47:05.069 --> 47:06.769
Don't I deserve to know?

47:06.770 --> 47:08.102
You're not going to like it.

47:14.661 --> 47:15.661
It...

47:16.954 --> 47:18.668
changes everything...

47:19.927 --> 47:20.927
knowing.

47:33.412 --> 47:34.745
I heard what happened.

47:35.670 --> 47:37.963
Yeah, you and everybody
else in San Vicente.

47:39.316 --> 47:41.147
Come on. I'll give you a ride.

47:45.781 --> 47:47.168
Vegas or TJ?

47:48.056 --> 47:50.421
I think you'll feel better
once you see Pernell.

47:52.440 --> 47:53.730
Actually...

47:54.906 --> 47:57.306
I feel just fine without seeing Pernell.

47:58.785 --> 47:59.915
I'm done.

48:02.442 --> 48:04.399
He's still your friend, Bobo.

48:04.551 --> 48:05.619
Friend.

48:07.622 --> 48:09.101
Would a friend get his homeboy

48:09.102 --> 48:10.625
entangled in this bullshit?

48:12.041 --> 48:14.203
Would a friend let a whole city believe

48:14.204 --> 48:15.571
that he's the true mayor

48:15.572 --> 48:16.472
pulling the strings

48:16.473 --> 48:17.917
on a puppet he put in the office?

48:18.052 --> 48:19.242
They're even saying

48:19.243 --> 48:21.143
that it was Pernell
who brought Brooks in

48:21.145 --> 48:23.812
when I was the one who courted Brooks,

48:23.813 --> 48:25.403
kept the deal alive for years

48:25.673 --> 48:27.859
and took it all the way
to that concrete pour...

48:28.002 --> 48:29.335
that fucking concrete pour.

48:30.686 --> 48:32.488
I'm going to find out who they is,

48:32.489 --> 48:34.053
and I'm going to put
my foot up their ass.

48:34.058 --> 48:35.055
How about that?

48:35.061 --> 48:36.817
- Not the foot.
- The foot.

48:38.180 --> 48:39.522
You got my back, huh?

48:39.528 --> 48:40.569
I got your back.

48:42.042 --> 48:43.603
And when they read the story,

48:43.604 --> 48:45.045
they're going to know the truth.

48:45.736 --> 48:48.357
You're not standing in anyone's shadow,

48:48.505 --> 48:50.634
especially not Pernell Harris.

48:53.628 --> 48:54.628
Okay.

48:57.126 --> 48:58.126
Yeah.

49:01.456 --> 49:02.687
Thank you for that.

49:04.821 --> 49:06.002
I called ahead.

49:06.223 --> 49:07.574
The hospital's ready for you.

49:07.580 --> 49:08.963
Yeah, change of plans.

49:09.561 --> 49:10.704
I'm going to go home...

49:11.095 --> 49:12.495
straight home.

49:13.882 --> 49:14.882
You coming?

49:22.917 --> 49:25.686
That monstrous fucking bitch.

49:26.858 --> 49:30.819
W-What kind of woman
has another woman raped?

49:31.259 --> 49:32.695
She wanted to hurt him.

49:33.260 --> 49:34.534
She was jealous.

49:36.422 --> 49:37.552
Did he love her back?

49:37.949 --> 49:38.949
No.

49:39.933 --> 49:41.163
It was just a fling,

49:41.714 --> 49:42.952
and he broke it off.

49:44.058 --> 49:45.312
Is that an excuse?

49:45.715 --> 49:47.465
No. No.

49:51.687 --> 49:52.724
I knew.

49:54.604 --> 49:56.572
I didn't know then,

49:56.573 --> 49:59.263
but I was... it was right there.

50:00.078 --> 50:01.078
Ohh.

50:02.946 --> 50:04.215
I knew when I caught him

50:04.216 --> 50:05.777
getting out of the Eastwood Apartments.

50:06.255 --> 50:07.805
He said that he had a meeting.

50:08.718 --> 50:09.903
That fucker.

50:16.466 --> 50:18.115
This is a trap, guaranteed.

50:18.613 --> 50:19.613
Don't worry.

50:20.224 --> 50:21.791
Somebody shoots up this neighborhood,

50:21.797 --> 50:24.784
the homeowners' association
would skin them alive.

50:26.333 --> 50:27.702
How did you find this place?

51:15.685 --> 51:17.083
What the fuck is this?

51:19.985 --> 51:21.519
The dead son was chopping it up

51:21.525 --> 51:23.665
with the woman who stole his software?

51:23.666 --> 51:25.044
What difference does it make?

51:26.118 --> 51:27.958
Let's find this Apex
thing and get out of here.

51:46.087 --> 51:47.127
Wilson.

51:51.407 --> 51:53.013
You sure Apex is a drive?

51:53.257 --> 51:54.784
Oh, shit.

51:59.162 --> 52:00.264
Apex.
