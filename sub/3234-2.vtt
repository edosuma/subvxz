02:28.744 --> 02:31.112
Good morning, Officer.

02:31.147 --> 02:33.381
Sir, can you turn the
music down? Oh, yeah.

02:33.415 --> 02:35.316
All right.

02:35.350 --> 02:37.317
Down means off.

02:37.352 --> 02:40.454
Of course. Okay.

02:40.488 --> 02:42.722
You know why I pulled
you over this morning?

02:42.757 --> 02:45.258
Well, I'm-- I'm pretty
sure I wasn't speeding.

02:45.293 --> 02:47.594
I've been using the
cruise control, so I--

02:47.628 --> 02:49.128
No, sir. Your windshield.

02:50.864 --> 02:53.099
License and registration, please.

02:54.701 --> 02:56.902
Right.

02:56.936 --> 02:59.771
Uh...

02:59.806 --> 03:03.942
This-- This was from Wayfarer 515.

03:03.976 --> 03:07.178
Um, my house was in
the debris field.

03:07.212 --> 03:08.946
Okay.

03:08.981 --> 03:11.749
Uh, and that's--

03:11.783 --> 03:13.751
that's what shattered
my windshield--

03:13.785 --> 03:16.453
some piece of wreckage
from the plane.

03:16.487 --> 03:18.488
I understand.

03:21.692 --> 03:24.761
Yoknow of-- of Flight 515,
the plane crash?

03:24.795 --> 03:26.696
You're wearing the ribbon.
Yes, sir.

03:26.730 --> 03:28.664
I'm quite aware of Wayfarer 515.

03:28.698 --> 03:30.966
I was one of the first
responders on the scene that day.

03:31.001 --> 03:32.868
Then what are you doing?

03:32.902 --> 03:35.671
Citing you, sir.

03:35.705 --> 03:38.206
What? What, you don't believe me?

03:38.241 --> 03:40.375
Sir, regardless of how that
windshield was damaged,

03:40.409 --> 03:42.677
this car is unsafe to
drive in this condition.

03:42.711 --> 03:44.712
Stay in the car, please.

03:48.316 --> 03:50.617
Wait. Wait just a minute.
Just one minute.

03:50.652 --> 03:52.719
Sir, I asked you to stay
in the vehicle. No, no, no.

03:52.754 --> 03:55.121
I can get out of my own car.
Sir, listen--

03:55.156 --> 03:56.356
No, no, no. You listen to me.

03:56.390 --> 03:58.257
It's time for you to listen to me.

03:58.292 --> 04:01.360
Sir, what you need to do is take a
deep breath, calm down This is America.

04:01.395 --> 04:04.163
and get back in that car now.
I have rights. Do you understand that?

04:04.197 --> 04:06.665
At least have the common
decency to hear me out.

04:06.699 --> 04:08.299
I need you to step back right now.

04:08.334 --> 04:10.134
Did you even hear what I said?
Sir, calm down.

04:10.169 --> 04:12.335
Now you're giving me a ticket?
I told you

04:12.370 --> 04:14.270
that my house was
in the debris field.

04:14.304 --> 04:17.372
Do you have the remotest
inkling of what that means?

04:17.406 --> 04:20.173
Sir, calm down. Hellfire
rained down on my house

04:20.208 --> 04:22.742
Sir, I need you to step back now.
where my children sleep!

04:22.776 --> 04:24.576
There were body parts in my yard!

04:24.611 --> 04:27.512
Sir, this is your last warning.
You gotta be kidding me!

04:27.546 --> 04:29.314
You got about two
seconds to stand down,

04:29.348 --> 04:31.082
or I'm gonna pepper spray you.
You're gonna pepper spray? Perfect!

04:31.116 --> 04:34.018
That is just perfect!
Pepper spray the man

04:34.052 --> 04:36.853
who's expressing his opinion
under the First Amendment!

04:44.227 --> 04:54.328

05:02.777 --> 05:06.045
Lastly, a little something
from down El Paso way.

05:06.079 --> 05:09.014
Border Patrol came
across multiple homicides

05:09.049 --> 05:11.616
just this side of the border.

05:11.651 --> 05:13.551
Truck turn out to be a chicken run

05:13.586 --> 05:15.753
out of Juarez and Laredo.

05:15.787 --> 05:17.755
Border Patrol's been
playing hide-and-seek

05:17.789 --> 05:19.823
<i>with these polleros for two years.</i>

05:19.857 --> 05:22.325
But this time,
as soon as they made it acro,

05:22.359 --> 05:25.061
someone hit them-- hit them hard.

05:25.095 --> 05:27.596
We're talking a driver
and nine illegals.

05:27.630 --> 05:29.097
No sign of the shooters.

05:29.132 --> 05:30.999
This truck was carrying
more than just people.

05:31.033 --> 05:33.501
What are we looking at? Weed,
coke, or meth?

05:33.535 --> 05:36.536
Nah. Doesn't look like they
were transporting narcotics.

05:36.571 --> 05:38.605
So, why did the Border
Patrol kick this to us?

05:38.639 --> 05:40.673
They didn't. I pulled it.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.842
You ask me,
ths high-end cartel work.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.677
Los Zetas, maybe.

05:44.711 --> 05:48.180
Question is, why do we
have Juarez-style action

05:48.214 --> 05:50.148
on our side of the DMZ?

05:50.182 --> 05:52.483
They sending a message
or clearing a path?

05:52.517 --> 05:56.587
Or was this about stopping
one particular border-hopper?

05:56.621 --> 05:58.555
Maybe one of those extra-crispies

05:58.589 --> 06:00.824
knew something he shouldn't.

06:00.858 --> 06:02.859
Anyway, keep your eyes open.

06:02.893 --> 06:05.394
All right. That's it.
Slow news day.

06:05.429 --> 06:07.563
Add one more to the countdown.

06:07.597 --> 06:09.498
Oh, yeah? What's that, Gomie?

06:09.532 --> 06:11.533
We're waiting on that
famous blue meth of yours.

06:11.567 --> 06:14.302
29 days since we saw it last.

06:14.336 --> 06:17.505
Yeah, well, it's still out there,
Gomie. Don't worry.

06:17.539 --> 06:19.740
Local PD. I gotta take this.

06:19.774 --> 06:21.875
Gomie, go beat your piÃƒÂ±ata.

06:21.910 --> 06:24.911
Rest of you jokers- too d-
-- quiet in here.

06:24.946 --> 06:27.180
Go catch some bad guys.

06:27.215 --> 06:29.249
Schrader.

06:29.283 --> 06:31.283
Hey, what's up, Paul?

06:32.452 --> 06:34.452
What?

07:22.960 --> 07:25.294
Jesse?

07:25.329 --> 07:28.363
Hey, Dad.

07:28.398 --> 07:31.132
So you're fixing up the house, huh?

07:31.167 --> 07:33.301
Doing a little work, yeah.

07:34.637 --> 07:36.704
Uh, I'll bounce.

07:36.738 --> 07:38.773
It's-- It's cool.

07:40.876 --> 07:42.710
You doing okay?

07:43.712 --> 07:45.680
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

07:45.714 --> 07:48.249
I just happened to be driving by

07:48.283 --> 07:50.017
and saw the sign.

07:50.052 --> 07:52.853
So, you're selling the place.

07:52.888 --> 07:55.088
In this market.

07:55.122 --> 07:56.955
Can you believe it?

07:58.188 --> 08:01.089
I see you moved the garage.
That's bold.

08:01.124 --> 08:03.925
Your mother's idea.
It's quite an operation.

08:03.959 --> 08:06.360
We did, all new stucco,
all the master suite,

08:06.395 --> 08:09.096
sandblasted,
fumigated the basement...

08:11.265 --> 08:13.099
Right on.

08:14.101 --> 08:15.768
Yeah.

08:15.803 --> 08:19.304
Fixing up the place totally
increases resale value.

08:19.339 --> 08:21.940
I read that in-
I want to say, like,

08:21.974 --> 08:23.641
<i>Time magazine.</i>

08:25.077 --> 08:28.579
So, what'd you do with
the upstairs bathroom?

08:28.613 --> 08:31.348
All redone. New tiles in
the bathrooms and kitchens,

08:31.382 --> 08:33.349
granite countertops,
new appliances--

08:33.384 --> 08:36.085
all top of the line.

08:36.119 --> 08:38.520
D---. That's great, Dad.

08:38.554 --> 08:40.522
Think, uh, I can get a tour?

08:40.556 --> 08:43.991
Eh, these guys are
trying to finish up.

08:44.025 --> 08:45.960
Maybe we'd better
stay out of their way.

08:48.196 --> 08:52.131
There are pictures on the Web site,
if you wanna take a look.

08:55.635 --> 08:57.035
Cool.

08:57.069 --> 09:00.004
You're looking healthy.

09:00.038 --> 09:02.740
I'll tell your mother.
She'll be happy.

09:05.343 --> 09:07.210
Thanks.

09:07.245 --> 09:10.580
You know, I could come by sometime

09:10.614 --> 09:13.215
for, uh, dinner or something.

09:13.250 --> 09:15.417
Yeah.

09:15.452 --> 09:17.486
Sometime.

09:20.756 --> 09:22.590
Okay.

09:22.624 --> 09:24.558
Later, Dad.

09:37.270 --> 09:39.237
You know, look,

09:39.272 --> 09:41.806
he's a high school
teacher over at Wynne.

09:41.841 --> 09:44.675
Never been in trouble
a day of his life.

09:44.709 --> 09:46.677
Found out he's got lung cancer,

09:46.711 --> 09:48.845
and now his wife kicks
the poor b------

09:48.880 --> 09:50.780
out of his own house.

09:50.815 --> 09:52.315
I mean, look, guys,

09:52.349 --> 09:55.050
if anybody rates a little slack,

09:55.085 --> 09:57.552
here's the guy.

10:04.325 --> 10:07.160
Hey, Walt, uh,

10:07.194 --> 10:10.429
you remember Officer Cavanaugh?

10:16.435 --> 10:20.404
Officer, I'm very sorry
that I lost my tper.

10:20.438 --> 10:23.740
There's no excuse for my behavior.

10:23.774 --> 10:26.074
It was disrespectful.

10:52.265 --> 10:54.533
She's divorcing me.

10:56.836 --> 11:01.172
Oh, I don't know what
to tell you, buddy.

11:01.206 --> 11:03.507
It is what it is.

11:06.077 --> 11:08.745
She doesn't want
me to see the kids.

11:12.215 --> 11:15.149
She said that?

11:15.184 --> 11:17.585
Yeah.

11:39.269 --> 11:41.970
You don't write? You don't call?

11:46.407 --> 11:48.140
G--.

11:49.442 --> 11:51.443
It's a disaster.

11:52.611 --> 11:54.579
It is not a disaster.

11:54.614 --> 11:57.819
Oh, okay. It's not a disaster,
all right?

11:57.853 --> 12:01.455
She's not going to the cops.
She's not gonna tell a living soul.

12:01.490 --> 12:03.457
You wanna know why?

12:03.491 --> 12:05.292
One word:

12:05.326 --> 12:07.294
"blowback."

12:07.328 --> 12:09.395
If she blabs,

12:09.430 --> 12:12.732
it'll be a disaster for her.

12:12.766 --> 12:14.867
That DEA brother-in-law?

12:14.901 --> 12:16.468
Whew! Screwed.

12:16.503 --> 12:18.136
You were right under his nose.

12:18.170 --> 12:20.805
He'll be lucky if they let
him bust glue-sniffers

12:20.839 --> 12:22.573
at the hobby shop.

12:22.608 --> 12:25.009
The kids-- Paging Dr. Phil.

12:25.043 --> 12:29.412
My daddy's a drug dealer,
and my mommy turned him in.

12:29.447 --> 12:31.380
And the house-- gone.

12:31.415 --> 12:33.883
The feds will come and RICO her
and the kids out on the street.

12:33.917 --> 12:36.085
Ooh, good luck arguing
with them on that.

12:36.119 --> 12:38.421
No. It's not gonna happen.

12:38.455 --> 12:41.089
She's bluffing,

12:41.124 --> 12:43.224
and she knows it.

12:48.930 --> 12:51.264
Her going to the police

12:51.298 --> 12:54.066
is not the point, Saul.

12:54.101 --> 12:56.769
She's out of my life.
Do you understand?

12:56.803 --> 12:59.304
I've lost my family,

12:59.338 --> 13:02.740
everything that I care about.

13:02.774 --> 13:05.909
Hey, buddy,

13:05.944 --> 13:08.244
uh, it's bad.

13:08.279 --> 13:10.747
All right... It's a calamity,

13:10.781 --> 13:14.216
but we live to fight another day.

13:14.251 --> 13:17.352
And after a decent
interval of time,

13:17.386 --> 13:19.153
well,

13:19.188 --> 13:21.722
there are other fish in the sea.

13:23.291 --> 13:25.692
You've been out of
circulation for a while.

13:25.726 --> 13:29.161
I mean, you'll be just
amazed at what's out there.

13:29.196 --> 13:31.497
Thailand, the Czech Republic...

13:31.531 --> 13:34.733
I mean, those women are so grateful

13:34.767 --> 13:37.035
to even be here.

13:38.770 --> 13:40.571
In the meantime,

13:40.605 --> 13:42.740
idle hands are the
devil's playthings,

13:42.774 --> 13:45.342
so, uh, you should
get back on the horse

13:45.376 --> 13:47.777
and do what you do best.

13:47.812 --> 13:51.914
First step: talk to our
friend and get cooking.

13:59.154 --> 14:02.456
I can't be the bad guy.

14:02.490 --> 14:05.158
What?

14:06.694 --> 14:09.529
I can't be the bad guy.

14:13.600 --> 14:16.035
Okay.

14:16.069 --> 14:18.270
Uh...

14:18.305 --> 14:21.974
You know, we'll,
uh-- we'll revisit.

14:22.008 --> 14:24.743
Just, uh,

14:24.778 --> 14:27.379
promise me you won't hang
yourself in the closet.

15:00.505 --> 15:02.940
Pop-pop!

15:02.975 --> 15:05.743
Pop-pop, the ice-cream man!

15:05.778 --> 15:08.412
Ohh...

15:11.647 --> 15:13.814
Huh?

15:13.848 --> 15:16.249
Don't tell your mom. Okay.

15:24.858 --> 15:26.692
<i>Yeah. It's me.</i>

15:26.726 --> 15:29.094
<i>We may have a wife problem.</i>

15:29.128 --> 15:32.730
<i>Uh-huh. Look, I need eyes on it.</i>

15:32.764 --> 15:35.465
You got an address?

15:54.359 --> 15:56.694
Hey, dinner's gonna be late.

15:56.728 --> 15:58.695
Uncle Hank and Aunt Marie
are bringing takeout.

15:58.730 --> 16:01.131
But, uh,

16:01.166 --> 16:05.035
if you're hungry,
I could rustle something up.

16:05.070 --> 16:07.271
<i>* </i>

16:19.347 --> 16:21.315
Okay.

16:32.862 --> 16:35.364
Hey, buddy, pass the ketchup,
will you?

16:45.975 --> 16:47.376
What?

16:47.410 --> 16:50.379
I've had enough trans
fat for one lifetime.

16:50.413 --> 16:53.081
A two-day drive from the nearest ocean,
and you're eating raw fish.

16:53.116 --> 16:54.616
That's all I'm saying.

16:54.650 --> 16:56.184
Mmm.

16:56.219 --> 16:59.086
Been a while since that minnow
been swimming. Right, buddy?

17:04.156 --> 17:06.458
You know, um, Flynn, uh, here

17:06.492 --> 17:08.460
is looking for a
part-time job, so...

17:08.493 --> 17:11.262
I don't know. If you know of anything,
you might wanna--

17:11.297 --> 17:13.464
My-- My name's Walter Jr.

17:13.499 --> 17:14.932
Like-- Like--

17:14.965 --> 17:17.635
What, you-- you can't
even say his name?

17:17.669 --> 17:20.971
Um, if you've changed your
mind about being called Flynn,

17:21.005 --> 17:23.173
all you need to do is just tell me

17:23.207 --> 17:25.407
that you don't want to be
called Flynn. You know what?

17:25.442 --> 17:27.574
Dad didn't even show
up till fourth period,

17:27.608 --> 17:30.938
and his eyes were all red like
he'd been crying or something.

17:30.973 --> 17:33.902
But you-- you don't even care.

17:33.936 --> 17:37.467
And now, he won't
even drive me home.

17:37.501 --> 17:39.402
He won't say why,

17:39.437 --> 17:42.105
but I know it's because
you told him not to.

17:42.140 --> 17:44.441
Honey, I-- What?

17:44.475 --> 17:47.110
I don't know what your problem is.

17:47.145 --> 17:49.177
You may not love him anymore,

17:49.211 --> 17:52.441
but I do.

17:52.476 --> 17:54.807
I mean, why you gotta be--

17:54.842 --> 17:57.673
Why-- Why you gotta
be such a-- a b----?

17:57.707 --> 17:59.505
Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no. Oh...

17:59.539 --> 18:02.539
Hank-- Hank-- Hank--
You don't talk to your mom that way.

18:02.574 --> 18:05.408
It's-- It's-- It's all right.

18:07.011 --> 18:09.545
Hey. Hey.

18:09.579 --> 18:12.080
Skyler, I know that you
must have your reasons

18:12.114 --> 18:14.248
for...all of this.

18:14.283 --> 18:15.983
I...

18:17.619 --> 18:20.288
Sky, uh,

18:20.322 --> 18:22.890
I-- I know it's
none of my business,

18:22.925 --> 18:24.559
but, uh,

18:26.462 --> 18:29.831
keeping Walt from the kids...

18:34.737 --> 18:36.938
You're right, Hank.

18:38.374 --> 18:41.843
It's none of your business.

18:46.681 --> 18:48.815
Oh, my G--.

18:48.850 --> 18:50.784
After all of that, please tell me

18:50.818 --> 18:52.886
that you are still not curious.

18:52.920 --> 18:54.554
There's nothing to
be curious about.

18:54.588 --> 18:56.224
Please.

18:56.259 --> 18:58.762
The day I heard there was a
second cell phone, I knew.

18:58.796 --> 19:00.764
Believe me. I've seen
it a hundred times.

19:00.798 --> 19:03.733
Okay. All right. So, what?

19:03.768 --> 19:06.503
Stop dancing around it.
What is it exactly

19:06.537 --> 19:08.037
that you have seen a hundred times?

19:08.072 --> 19:09.539
Please, please, enlighten me.

19:10.574 --> 19:12.475
Look, a guy like Walt--

19:12.509 --> 19:14.643
a nice guy, decent,
smart, you know?

19:14.678 --> 19:18.046
Let's face it-- underachiever,
dead-end life, okay?

19:18.081 --> 19:21.349
He gets cancer. Time's running out.
Midlife crisis.

19:21.384 --> 19:24.518
He acts up. Steps out.

19:24.553 --> 19:26.286
Then the wife-- she catches him.

19:26.321 --> 19:28.555
I mean, it's a story
as old as time.

19:28.589 --> 19:30.656
Look, do the math, Marie.

19:30.691 --> 19:33.293
Only comes out one way.

19:33.328 --> 19:35.497
Knowing Walt, he, uh,

19:35.531 --> 19:38.800
felt so guilty,
he probably told her himself.

19:38.834 --> 19:40.635
Yeah, I--

19:40.669 --> 19:42.837
I don't know. I think...

19:42.871 --> 19:45.705
if he cheated on her,
that she would've told me by now.

19:45.740 --> 19:49.108
It just feels like...

19:49.142 --> 19:51.076
something more.

19:59.246 --> 20:02.443
Yes, yes, yes. 24-7 coverage.
Need you ask?

20:02.478 --> 20:04.142
How much is this gonna run me?

20:06.176 --> 20:08.310
J----. I'm in the wrong business.

20:08.344 --> 20:10.911
Yeah. I'll call you.

20:10.945 --> 20:12.710
Return of the prodigal.

20:12.744 --> 20:14.109
Welcome back to the
land of the living.

20:14.144 --> 20:15.477
How you feeling? I'm good.

20:15.511 --> 20:18.210
Of course you are.
The world's your oyster.

20:18.244 --> 20:20.942
Am I right? Unencumbered young man

20:20.976 --> 20:24.342
with, uh, stacks of cash.

20:24.376 --> 20:26.842
Hey, I'm, uh-- I'm jealous.

20:26.876 --> 20:29.608
Hand to G--, I'm jealous.

20:29.642 --> 20:32.009
Yeah, speaking of cash,

20:32.043 --> 20:34.476
uh, you know what's giving
me heartburn lately?

20:34.511 --> 20:37.278
Your former partner. This guy...

20:37.312 --> 20:39.046
He works like a b------, right?

20:39.080 --> 20:41.114
Builds a business, single-handed.

20:41.148 --> 20:43.849
Finally, the big money shows up,
and what does he do?

20:43.883 --> 20:46.784
He walks out.

20:46.819 --> 20:48.886
Talent like that,

20:48.920 --> 20:51.220
and he just flushes
it down the crapper.

20:51.255 --> 20:53.756
It's like Michelangelo won't paint.

20:53.790 --> 20:56.257
Look, I know you're
out of it and all,

20:56.291 --> 20:57.758
but you--

20:57.792 --> 20:59.826
you wouldn't talk to him,
would you?

20:59.861 --> 21:06.233
I mean, help him pull his head out of his
a--?

21:06.267 --> 21:09.536
He won't listen to me,
he's not gonna listen to you,

21:09.571 --> 21:12.939
all due respect.

21:12.974 --> 21:14.941
You want a job?

21:14.975 --> 21:17.477
A job?

21:17.511 --> 21:19.478
Who's got a job for me?

21:19.513 --> 21:21.647
I do.

22:30.731 --> 22:33.766
<i>Okay, let's see some jokers.</i>

22:36.735 --> 22:38.635
<i>I used to be an English teacher,</i>

22:38.670 --> 22:40.837
<i>so I'd better take
grammar for 100.</i>

22:51.778 --> 22:54.545
<i>All right. Child stars for 100.</i>

24:50.240 --> 24:52.007
Hi. Hey.

24:52.041 --> 24:53.842
Thought I'd, uh,

24:53.877 --> 24:55.477
well, visit, if you don't mind.

24:55.511 --> 24:57.546
No, of course not. You don't, uh...

24:57.580 --> 24:59.548
You don't need the room,
do you? No.

24:59.582 --> 25:02.516
I just needed some more
space to spread out.

25:02.551 --> 25:04.551
Just wanted to say hello
to little Holly here.

25:04.585 --> 25:06.487
Hey, girl. Hi.

25:06.521 --> 25:09.055
Oh, it's okay.
It's okay, it's okay.

25:09.090 --> 25:10.890
Oh, yeah.

25:10.924 --> 25:13.292
She is a beauty. Look at her.

25:13.326 --> 25:17.395
Hey, thanks for being so
flexible on me coming in.

25:17.429 --> 25:20.564
Well, I just wish we
had you back full time.

25:20.599 --> 25:22.666
You do brighten up the place.

25:26.236 --> 25:29.004
Listen, believe me, this is, uh...

25:29.038 --> 25:30.939
I don't wanna bring this up,

25:30.973 --> 25:33.875
but I-- I can't sign off
on these quarterlies.

25:33.909 --> 25:36.944
I'm sorry. I just can't.

25:39.114 --> 25:41.548
Is that right?

25:44.385 --> 25:46.352
If you're gonna do this, Ted,

25:46.386 --> 25:48.987
you can't be so glaring about it.

25:50.990 --> 25:53.190
Glaring.

25:53.225 --> 25:56.193
Okay.

25:56.227 --> 25:58.128
That does sound bad.

25:58.162 --> 26:01.163
Uh, show me what's bothering you.

26:08.137 --> 26:09.770
Keller.

26:09.805 --> 26:11.805
No.

26:11.839 --> 26:12.972
Again...

26:13.007 --> 26:14.173
G--, I'm sorry.

26:14.208 --> 26:16.175
I know how you feel about this.

26:16.209 --> 26:18.410
Revenue with no backup.

26:19.412 --> 26:21.913
Here, here, and here.

26:21.947 --> 26:23.948
I don't even know what to say.

26:31.922 --> 26:34.823
Yeah. Um...

26:34.857 --> 26:36.325
Yeah, well, uh...

26:36.359 --> 26:38.693
Okay. This is-
This is fixable, right?

26:38.728 --> 26:42.962
How about if I just push,
uh, 28,800,

26:42.996 --> 26:45.764
um, out of this into next quarter?

26:45.798 --> 26:48.966
Would you sign it then?

26:50.668 --> 26:53.136
I'm--

26:53.170 --> 26:55.372
I'm just saying

26:55.406 --> 26:59.776
I can't sign it as
it currently exists.

26:59.810 --> 27:02.011
Fair enough.

27:02.045 --> 27:03.946
I'll take care of it.

27:03.980 --> 27:05.881
Thank you for the heads-up.

27:05.915 --> 27:07.816
Well, you won't have to
deal with this again,

27:07.850 --> 27:09.717
I swear.

27:11.320 --> 27:13.320
What if your kids found out?

27:16.824 --> 27:19.125
If my kids found out?

27:19.159 --> 27:21.127
This-- what you're doing.

27:21.161 --> 27:24.062
I mean, someday,
they're gonna be old enough.

27:24.097 --> 27:26.331
How would you explain it to them?

27:28.767 --> 27:30.968
Well-- Wow.

27:31.002 --> 27:33.470
Put me on the spot, why don't you?

27:35.206 --> 27:38.207
I guess maybe I'd, um--

27:38.241 --> 27:42.009
I'd say that, uh,
I might have feet of clay that--

27:42.043 --> 27:44.244
But that whatever I did,
I did thinking of them.

27:44.278 --> 27:46.812
You know? Trying to provide.

27:46.846 --> 27:50.248
And, uh, I'd ask them

27:50.283 --> 27:53.752
to try to take the
time to understand...

27:55.287 --> 27:57.721
You know what? Truth is,

27:57.756 --> 27:59.723
I haven't thought that
far ahead, Skyler.

27:59.757 --> 28:03.330
I'm just trying to keep
my head above water, so...

28:03.364 --> 28:05.531
I better get back to it.

28:12.640 --> 28:15.874
Oh, G--.

28:18.444 --> 28:20.678
Hi, Walt. Listen.

28:20.712 --> 28:23.814
I'm-- I can't talk-
I'm at work right now.

28:23.848 --> 28:25.315
What?

28:25.349 --> 28:28.718
Louis dropped him off.
He was here when I got home.

28:28.752 --> 28:30.886
No, no, no. Of course.
No. He's not staying.

28:30.920 --> 28:32.787
He understands that.

28:32.821 --> 28:34.788
I'll-- I'll bring him
anywhere you want.

28:34.822 --> 28:36.856
Dad...

28:38.158 --> 28:40.126
Well, yeah, it is rush hour.

28:40.160 --> 28:42.862
I mean, I could fight traffic and
bring him down to Beneke now,

28:42.896 --> 28:46.164
but wouldn't it be easier if we...

28:46.199 --> 28:48.099
Right. Okay. Good.

28:48.134 --> 28:50.401
So we'll meet you at the house.

28:50.436 --> 28:52.269
Okay. Bye.

28:53.805 --> 28:55.306
W-Why are you doing this?

28:55.340 --> 28:59.176
She's just trying to
k-keep me from seeing you,

28:59.210 --> 29:00.944
and you're helping her.

29:00.979 --> 29:03.614
No. No, son. I mean, your--

29:03.648 --> 29:07.249
your mother-- she has her reasons.

29:07.284 --> 29:09.251
What reasons?

29:11.587 --> 29:14.022
They're, uh...

29:14.056 --> 29:16.424
Well, they're...

29:18.361 --> 29:20.462
Well, they're just a little

29:20.496 --> 29:22.397
difficult to delineate, but--

29:22.431 --> 29:26.167
I mean, yes, there are
two sides to every story.

29:26.201 --> 29:29.369
Always. But, uh,

29:29.403 --> 29:31.671
she, uh...

29:33.173 --> 29:34.674
Yeah.

29:36.276 --> 29:38.978
This is just how it has to be.

29:39.012 --> 29:41.380
For now. Okay?

29:41.415 --> 29:44.050
And, look, your home is your home,

29:44.084 --> 29:46.452
and that is where you belong, okay?

29:46.486 --> 29:48.287
But it's where you belong.

29:48.322 --> 29:51.057
Dad, it-- it's your house.

29:51.091 --> 29:52.992
Uncle Hank, Aunt Marie--

29:53.027 --> 29:54.928
everybody knows that you hen't done

29:54.962 --> 29:57.263
anything wrong.

29:57.298 --> 30:01.101
Everybody is on your side.

30:04.104 --> 30:06.672
Well, it's-- it's--

30:06.707 --> 30:09.442
it's not about
taking sides, though.

30:09.476 --> 30:13.012
How can-- How can you let
her treat you like this?

30:13.046 --> 30:14.513
Now, come on. How-- How--

30:14.547 --> 30:16.615
How can you just-- just take it?

30:16.650 --> 30:19.718
Just listen to me,
okay? No matter what,

30:19.753 --> 30:21.220
all of this has nothing to do

30:21.255 --> 30:22.889
with how we feel about you, okay?

30:22.923 --> 30:26.726
We both love you very,
very much, okay?

30:26.761 --> 30:30.730
You and your sister
will come first, always.

30:30.765 --> 30:33.400
Hmm?

30:33.434 --> 30:35.868
Now, come on.

30:35.902 --> 30:38.201
Let's, uh...

30:38.236 --> 30:41.768
Let's try to see this in
a positive light, okay?

30:41.801 --> 30:43.201
Both of us.

30:43.235 --> 30:46.134
Let's just buck up.

30:46.168 --> 30:49.899
Then I'll take you home.

30:53.033 --> 30:55.698
Uh, let me first just

30:55.732 --> 30:58.364
hit the old bathroom.

31:00.967 --> 31:02.935
*

31:16.080 --> 31:17.847
Hello.

31:17.881 --> 31:19.849
Good afternoon. Nice to meet you.

31:19.883 --> 31:21.350
Saul Goodman. Nice to meet you.

31:21.384 --> 31:24.619
You're not that lawyer on
late-night television, are you?

31:24.654 --> 31:26.621
Better call Saul!

31:28.657 --> 31:30.925
I get it all the time.

31:30.959 --> 31:33.193
We're here to discuss
the sale of the property

31:33.228 --> 31:34.828
at 9809 Margo.

31:34.862 --> 31:38.364
I get it. Flat-fee clients.
Am I right?

31:38.399 --> 31:41.700
Well, folks,
today's your lucky day.

31:41.735 --> 31:45.504
I represent a client who
shall remain nameless.

31:45.538 --> 31:48.173
However, for our purposes,
you might just as well

31:48.207 --> 31:50.675
visualize a large bag of money.

31:50.709 --> 31:54.811
This individual wants to buy
your use today, for cash.

31:54.846 --> 31:57.781
Cash? Cash. I know.
In this economy.

31:57.815 --> 32:01.117
In fact, the money is already burning
a hole in my client's account.

32:01.151 --> 32:04.553
You can ask Mr. Gardiner. I've shown
him all the pertinent financials.

32:04.587 --> 32:07.022
It the only reason
we're sitting here.

32:07.056 --> 32:08.957
Fair enough.

32:08.991 --> 32:11.626
We, uh, get a few papers
signed and notarized,

32:11.660 --> 32:13.294
we can take care of this right now.

32:13.328 --> 32:16.330
In fact, I can wire you your
money this very afternoon.

32:16.364 --> 32:20.166
There's just one little
hair in the soup--

32:20.200 --> 32:22.468
uh, the price.

32:25.371 --> 32:29.140
We feel 875 is very fair.

32:29.175 --> 32:32.576
But I suppose there's always a little,
uh, wiggle room.

32:32.611 --> 32:37.014
Well, you wiggle us on down to 400,

32:37.048 --> 32:38.848
and you got yourselves a deal.

32:38.882 --> 32:42.751
400,0? What is that, a joke?

32:42.785 --> 32:45.219
No, that's my offer.

32:45.254 --> 32:47.722
That's less than half price.

32:47.756 --> 32:49.957
We put almost that much
into the renovations alone.

32:49.991 --> 32:52.259
Why don't we just cut the clown act

32:52.294 --> 32:54.861
and you tell us what you're
willing to come up to?

32:54.895 --> 32:57.696
400,000. That's my final offer.

32:57.731 --> 32:59.631
Well, this is a waste of time.
Ridiculous.

32:59.665 --> 33:02.599
How could you possibly imagine that
we would entertain this? Come on, hon.

33:02.634 --> 33:04.601
I don't know. I just thought
some allowance was in order

33:04.635 --> 33:06.836
once I heard about the meth lab.

33:06.870 --> 33:08.871
The one that used to
be in the basement.

33:08.905 --> 33:12.273
I looked over your signed
disclosure statements,

33:12.308 --> 33:14.041
and I don't see any
mention of a meth lab.

33:14.076 --> 33:17.043
No. No. Oh, you got
your termite inspection.

33:17.078 --> 33:19.879
That's good. But no meth lab.

33:19.913 --> 33:23.115
Now, some would call that fraud

33:23.149 --> 33:25.483
in service of concealing a felony.

33:25.518 --> 33:27.685
I, myself, am more open-minded.

33:27.719 --> 33:30.754
But it is tricky.

33:30.789 --> 33:33.724
<i>Don't get me wrong.
I applaud your c------.</i>

33:33.758 --> 33:36.058
I mean, good try in sneaking

33:36.093 --> 33:38.960
a meth-contaminated
property past the buyer.

33:38.994 --> 33:41.729
I mean, you know,
could've been a good deal for you.

33:41.763 --> 33:44.931
Too bad. Now, I uld

33:44.965 --> 33:48.434
file a suit and encumber
this property indefinitely,

33:48.468 --> 33:50.902
or I could start some
criminal proceedings.

33:50.936 --> 33:54.037
But I don't think any of
us want that now, do we?

33:54.072 --> 33:57.440
How about it,
counselor? Do you concur?

34:11.250 --> 34:13.150
*

34:16.121 --> 34:18.456
Ta-da.

34:18.489 --> 34:20.324
Here you go, son.

34:22.059 --> 34:25.761
Come on. It's not Devil's Island.

34:31.099 --> 34:33.367
Okay. Ooh.

34:38.275 --> 34:40.212
Here we go.

34:42.684 --> 34:43.985
Oh. Hey.

34:44.020 --> 34:46.123
Hello.

34:46.157 --> 34:48.159
Ah.

34:48.195 --> 34:51.233
Uh, mmm. Brought pizza.

34:51.266 --> 34:54.440
Yeah. Well, I'm making dinner.

34:54.475 --> 34:57.211
Oh, okay. I'll just, uh,
put it in the fridge.

34:57.246 --> 34:59.847
It's even better the next day, huh?

35:03.084 --> 35:04.217
Hi, honey.

35:04.251 --> 35:05.885
Uh...

35:08.522 --> 35:10.823
Sorry.

35:10.858 --> 35:12.024
Yeah.

35:13.793 --> 35:15.494
All right. Skyler...

35:17.697 --> 35:21.599
Honey, what kind of example
do we want to set here?

35:21.633 --> 35:24.267
Right? I mean, can't we
at least just sit down

35:24.302 --> 35:26.469
and eat a piece of pizza together?

35:26.503 --> 35:30.339
Just to hash things out
like adults? You know--

35:30.374 --> 35:33.209
We have...discussed

35:33.243 --> 35:35.210
everything we ne to discuss.

35:35.245 --> 35:37.980
I thought I made myself very clear.

35:41.618 --> 35:43.952
I got dipping sticks.

37:05.476 --> 37:07.443
<i>You've reached Walt's
temporary number.</i>

37:07.478 --> 37:09.746
<i>Please leave a message. </i>

37:12.982 --> 37:15.884
<i>When I went out this morning
to get the newspaper,</i>

37:15.919 --> 37:18.954
<i>I saw a pizza on our roof.</i>

37:18.988 --> 37:21.824
<i>Would you know anything
about that?</i>

37:21.858 --> 37:25.294
<i>Listen to me, Walt.
You need to control yourself.</i>

37:25.329 --> 37:27.730
<i>Calm down, accept the situation,</i>

37:27.765 --> 37:29.999
<i>and keep your distance.</i>

37:30.034 --> 37:31.834
<i>If you can't manage that,</i>

37:31.869 --> 37:34.370
<i>I will get a restraining order.</i>

37:42.545 --> 37:45.079
Skyler. Skyler.

37:46.213 --> 37:48.180
I got your restraining
order right here!

37:48.214 --> 37:49.848
Restrain this!

37:49.883 --> 37:52.050
Oh.

37:55.321 --> 37:56.988
Oh, yeah.

38:04.394 --> 38:07.027
Breaking even's not so bad.

38:07.062 --> 38:08.695
In this economy, a lot of people

38:08.730 --> 38:10.530
would kill to break even.

38:10.564 --> 38:13.098
Poor Jake. He had his heart set

38:13.133 --> 38:16.267
on going to space camp.

38:17.635 --> 38:19.502
Oh, no.

38:19.536 --> 38:22.270
Oh, G--. This is all we need.

38:24.578 --> 38:26.678
Hey, Mom, Dad.

38:26.713 --> 38:28.180
How's it going?

38:28.214 --> 38:30.649
Uh, Jesse, it's, uh,

38:30.683 --> 38:32.717
really not a good time.

38:34.551 --> 38:37.919
Jesse, the house has been sold.

38:37.954 --> 38:40.154
The new owners are
expected at any moment.

38:40.189 --> 38:42.522
Where do you think
you're going? Inside.

38:44.424 --> 38:47.054
I bought the place.

39:00.158 --> 39:02.894
Be back by 7, okay?

39:02.928 --> 39:04.930
I love you.

39:10.302 --> 39:12.736
Bye.

40:30.671 --> 40:32.371
Ahh!

40:33.707 --> 40:35.307
Jeez.

41:21.839 --> 41:23.172
Come on.

41:50.223 --> 41:52.991
Oh, G--!

41:55.994 --> 41:58.096
Ahh!

42:22.256 --> 42:24.190
Oh, s---- No!

42:26.160 --> 42:27.493
Oh, G--.

43:21.423 --> 43:25.926
*

43:31.098 --> 43:33.399
* It was dead *

43:33.433 --> 43:35.534
* You see, I've been
through the desert *

43:35.569 --> 43:37.769
* On a horse with no name *

43:37.804 --> 43:41.906
* It felt good to get
out of the rain *

43:41.941 --> 43:44.408
* In the desert *

43:44.442 --> 43:46.910
* You can remember your name *

43:46.945 --> 43:49.412
* 'Cause there ain't no one *

43:49.447 --> 43:52.215

44:19.374 --> 44:22.243
It's me. There's something
you should know about.

44:24.312 --> 44:26.247
Hold on.

44:43.534 --> 44:46.136
*

44:46.170 --> 44:48.704
* After three days *

44:48.739 --> 44:51.740
* In the desert fun *

44:51.775 --> 44:55.311
* I was looking at a riverbed *

44:55.312 --> 44:58.448
* The story it told *

44:58.482 --> 45:01.318
* Of a river that flowed *

45:01.353 --> 45:05.390
* Made me sad to
think it was dead *

45:05.424 --> 45:07.725
