00:55.097 --> 00:58.015
What would you do
to save someone you love?

00:59.685 --> 01:03.020
For Edward,
I would stop at nothing.

01:17.661 --> 01:19.495
What is he doing?

01:27.421 --> 01:29.547
Hey, party in the fountain!

01:41.852 --> 01:43.770
Edward!
Yoo-hoo!

01:49.735 --> 01:51.444
Edward! Edward!

02:20.307 --> 02:21.390
Edward!

02:21.475 --> 02:22.600
Edward? Where?

02:24.394 --> 02:26.562
Oh, my God! There he is!
Edward, we love you,
you're the best!

02:27.064 --> 02:28.815
No, Jacob's the best!

02:45.457 --> 02:47.583
He's exposing himself!

03:05.644 --> 03:06.936
No! No.

03:11.817 --> 03:12.942
Edward!

03:31.211 --> 03:33.379
Let me start
from the beginning.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.756
I used to live
with my mom in Nevada.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.926
But now she's always
on the road,

03:39.011 --> 03:40.469
because she started
doing some pro golfer.

03:44.808 --> 03:49.061
So, I came here
to the foggy town
of Sporks, Washington.

03:49.146 --> 03:52.523
3,120.

03:58.822 --> 04:00.072
Holy shit!

04:02.534 --> 04:05.369
Make that 3,119.

04:08.248 --> 04:12.627
Anyway, I came here
to live with my dad, Frank.

04:12.711 --> 04:14.837
He's the town sheriff.

04:17.507 --> 04:19.175
I haven't seen you
in a while.
Your hair's longer.

04:22.137 --> 04:24.472
I grew it out.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.352
I guess it's hard
for me to accept
my little girl's growing up.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.272
I mean,
look at the size
of those tits.

04:33.357 --> 04:34.523
Dad!

04:34.608 --> 04:35.691
What?

04:45.744 --> 04:48.621
I feel so lonely

04:48.705 --> 04:51.624
Nobody gets me

04:51.708 --> 04:57.713
I am so unhappy

04:57.798 --> 05:00.675
Why can't I find

05:00.759 --> 05:03.344
a cool alternative boyfriend?

05:07.474 --> 05:09.517
There is something
strange about this town.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.731
I couldn't put
my finger on it.

05:33.125 --> 05:35.960
I used to live here
when I was younger.

05:37.921 --> 05:40.756
But I haven't been
back in a long time.

05:45.762 --> 05:48.097
I kept your room
just as you left it.

05:58.442 --> 05:59.692
Great.

05:59.776 --> 06:01.444
Remember your hamster,
Herman?

06:03.905 --> 06:05.656
Might have missed
a couple of feedings.

06:07.492 --> 06:08.659
You could play
with your dollies.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.121
I don't think so.

06:14.583 --> 06:16.041
What's that?

06:16.126 --> 06:18.461
Oh, that's
a special edition
feel-real dolly.

06:18.545 --> 06:21.046
I warm it up
in the tub first
so it's not creepy.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.884
It's been lonely
since your mom left.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.386
Oh, hey.

06:30.265 --> 06:32.266
You wanna come downstairs?
Some people are excited
to see you.

06:32.350 --> 06:33.350
Who wants their pacie?

06:34.936 --> 06:35.519
Good girl.

06:37.606 --> 06:39.982
Dad, I'm a teenager.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.275
Right.

06:42.319 --> 06:44.153
I guess I'd better get you
some new stuff then.

06:49.409 --> 06:53.621
Frank didn't get me.
I wasn't his little girl
anymore.

07:06.134 --> 07:07.510
Becca, you remember
Bobby White.

07:08.303 --> 07:09.303
Yeah.

07:10.096 --> 07:11.472
You're looking good.

07:12.015 --> 07:14.809
Good? I'm in a wheelchair.

07:15.060 --> 07:17.311
I can't feel anything
below my waist.

07:17.604 --> 07:18.896
You know what's
below my waist?

07:19.356 --> 07:20.523
My penis!

07:21.483 --> 07:22.525
Sorry.

07:23.485 --> 07:26.153
We're all glad you're here,
especially your dad.

07:26.488 --> 07:28.113
He wouldn't
shut up about you.

07:28.198 --> 07:30.115
Careful there, Bob,
I'm gonna roll you
down the hill.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.700
Oh, boy,
I'm real scared.
Bring it on.

07:35.372 --> 07:37.039
Boy, here we go!

07:38.708 --> 07:40.793
You're in trouble
there, mister!

07:42.379 --> 07:43.796
Hi. I'm Jacob.

07:43.880 --> 07:44.880
Hi.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.593
We used to make
mud pies together.

07:51.012 --> 07:52.429
Play doctor?

07:53.139 --> 07:54.557
Oh, right, right.

07:56.059 --> 07:57.309
I remember now.

07:58.562 --> 08:00.020
I gave you
a prostate exam.

08:03.024 --> 08:06.443
So, are we going to be
at the same school?

08:06.987 --> 08:08.279
I go to school
on the reservation.

08:08.697 --> 08:10.739
It must be fun to drink
and gamble all day.

08:13.243 --> 08:16.287
Too bad we're not
gonna be at school
together.

08:16.371 --> 08:18.539
It'd be nice to know
at least one person.

08:25.255 --> 08:26.422
Got you a welcome
home present.

08:27.382 --> 08:28.424
What do you think?

08:31.177 --> 08:35.639
I think that you're trying
to buy my affection with
that piece-of-shit truck

08:35.724 --> 08:38.601
to make up for the years
that you neglected me
as a father.

08:39.644 --> 08:40.727
Told you she'd like it.

08:42.606 --> 08:44.106
That's great.

08:44.774 --> 08:45.983
I fixed up
the engine myself.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.026
Thanks, Jacob.

08:47.110 --> 08:48.819
Go ahead, hop in.

08:53.783 --> 08:57.536
Okay. So you gotta pump
the gas to start her up.

08:57.621 --> 08:59.121
Damn fleas.

09:06.087 --> 09:08.088
Jacob, your foot.

09:11.301 --> 09:15.429
Ever since puberty,
I've been feeling
a little different.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.891
Excuse me.
I gotta take a leak.

09:29.319 --> 09:32.905
I guess my body is just
going through some changes.

09:34.157 --> 09:35.240
Cat!

09:39.663 --> 09:41.246
Come here, cat!

09:41.331 --> 09:42.665
Come here!

10:02.394 --> 10:05.938
Transferring
to a school that's
already in session.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.940
Being the new kid
is never easy.

10:08.024 --> 10:11.110
Nice clothes.
Still shopping in
the boys' section?

10:11.194 --> 10:14.196
Give her a break.
That's what I used to wear
when I was a virgin.

10:15.740 --> 10:19.159
Where'd you get that haircut,
"Fantastic Lesbians"?

10:44.602 --> 10:45.644
Hey, new kid!

10:51.901 --> 10:53.068
Hi, I'm Derric.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.194
I'm Becca.

10:54.279 --> 10:55.988
I'm the eyes and ears
of this place.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.781
I can hook you up
with anything you need.

10:57.866 --> 11:01.493
Cheat sheets,
human growth hormone,
harvested organs.

11:05.540 --> 11:06.582
No, thanks.

11:10.253 --> 11:12.004
Oh, I get it.

11:12.088 --> 11:13.714
You're one of
those antisocial,

11:13.798 --> 11:15.090
long-suffering
loner types.

11:15.633 --> 11:21.013
Actually, I'm more
of the humorless type.
Kind of a sourpuss, really.

11:21.097 --> 11:23.474
Full of insecurities,
with no great personality,

11:23.558 --> 11:25.392
yet every hot guy
finds me irresistible.

11:29.272 --> 11:31.607
You must be Becca.
I'm Rick.

11:32.317 --> 11:36.278
Damn, girl, you seem
really boring and frigid.

11:36.362 --> 11:37.863
You want to go to
the prom with me?

11:37.947 --> 11:39.281
See?

11:39.365 --> 11:42.076
I'm Jennifer,
future prom queen.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.079
I'm gonna pretend
to be your BFF,
but if you touch Rick's wang,

11:45.163 --> 11:46.288
I'll cut you.

12:02.472 --> 12:03.972
Who are they?

12:07.143 --> 12:09.311
Oh! Those are the Sullens.

12:09.938 --> 12:12.064
They're, like,
all adopted by Dr. Carlton,

12:12.148 --> 12:14.274
so they're not
biologically-related,

12:14.359 --> 12:17.528
but they're really,
really close.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.831
They moved here
a few years ago,

12:28.998 --> 12:30.916
and they're, like,
super-weird.

12:31.292 --> 12:33.961
It's a total mystery.

12:34.045 --> 12:38.090
Their skin is ice-cold,
they feed on human flesh,

12:38.174 --> 12:40.425
and they all
sleep in coffins.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.137
Maybe they're Canadian.

12:44.639 --> 12:46.014
Oh!
Oh!

12:46.975 --> 12:49.309
And who's that?

12:50.103 --> 12:52.604
Snooki, JWOWW, DJ Pauly D...
No.

12:52.689 --> 12:54.439
Not the douchebags
from the Jersey Shore.

12:57.861 --> 12:59.027
Him.

13:02.282 --> 13:06.618
The really pale dude
with big hair
and constipated look.

13:09.831 --> 13:11.874
Edward Sullen.

13:11.958 --> 13:14.084
He's a complete hottie.

13:14.169 --> 13:17.421
But, evidently,
no one here is worthy.

13:19.883 --> 13:22.384
He wouldn't even accept me
as his Facebook friend.

13:25.471 --> 13:26.930
"Favorite activity.

13:27.015 --> 13:31.393
"Searching for a soul
which has been cast
into eternal damnation"?

13:31.895 --> 13:34.354
But I don't care
about Edward.

13:36.107 --> 13:38.859
I've got another guy
on the side. Yeah.

13:38.943 --> 13:41.278
Sadly, he went off
to fight in Iraq
for a year.

13:41.362 --> 13:45.240
But we write to each
other all the time.
His name is John.

13:48.411 --> 13:51.246
"Dear John,
two weeks together.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.790
"That's all it took
to fall in love with you.

13:53.875 --> 13:58.921
"And in those two weeks,
you did things to me
no guy had ever done before.

13:59.547 --> 14:02.382
"I just hope I'm able
to poop again soon."

14:05.637 --> 14:07.095
Are you, like,
even listening?

14:17.774 --> 14:21.902
Oh! You guys are having,
like, an instant connection.

14:23.321 --> 14:24.404
How can you tell?

14:24.489 --> 14:27.032
Duh. Hardwicke 101?

14:27.116 --> 14:29.534
You're both staring
at each other
in slow motion,

14:29.619 --> 14:31.912
which although
cheesy and obvious,

14:31.996 --> 14:33.914
it underscores your
respective yearnings.

14:34.624 --> 14:35.707
Oh!

14:36.000 --> 14:37.292
Right.

15:05.655 --> 15:06.738
Ah! Becca.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.408
Why don't you take
the empty seat next to
that mysterious boy

15:09.492 --> 15:11.743
you're destined
to have a fatalistic
relationship with

15:11.828 --> 15:14.121
that will spawn four books
and a movie franchise?

15:38.438 --> 15:39.938
Do I smell?

15:40.023 --> 15:41.690
Yeah. Like tuna.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.734
Lunch.

15:49.198 --> 15:50.699
I'm Becca.

15:52.035 --> 15:53.035
I'm Edward.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.579
So you're new to Sporks.

15:59.083 --> 16:00.292
How do you like
the weather?

16:00.376 --> 16:03.754
I don't like cold,
wet things.

16:04.672 --> 16:07.507
So you must
hate Slurpees.

16:12.013 --> 16:14.848
I'm just trying
to figure you out.

16:16.642 --> 16:19.519
All right, class.
Turn to page 63
in your books.

16:25.151 --> 16:29.946
This is biology.
Why are we reading
The Vampire Diaries?

16:37.538 --> 16:39.873
In the '80s,
coke was all the rage.

16:39.957 --> 16:41.416
The '90s, grunge.

16:41.918 --> 16:43.919
Now it's the era
of vampires.

16:45.254 --> 16:46.880
It's just super-trendy.

16:51.761 --> 16:53.345
That's amazing.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.230
Oh!

17:46.816 --> 17:48.191
Hi.

17:50.611 --> 17:51.862
Why aren't you
wearing a shirt?

17:51.946 --> 17:54.114
I work part-time at
Abercrombie & Fitch.

17:54.866 --> 17:57.075
It's always the same
inane questions.

17:57.160 --> 17:59.369
"Who are you?"
"Why are you doing this?"

17:59.495 --> 18:01.621
"Does the carpet
match the drapes?"

18:02.915 --> 18:04.833
Yeah.
Oh, that's hot.

18:08.379 --> 18:11.590
I got a serious
case of the munchies.

18:11.674 --> 18:14.092
And I think you know
what I need to eat.

18:15.845 --> 18:17.179
Cheetos?

18:19.682 --> 18:21.433
Oh, hell, yeah.

18:21.517 --> 18:23.852
Thanks, dawg.
You a'ight with me.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.687
Whoo!

18:29.734 --> 18:31.359
Antoine?
What?

18:33.237 --> 18:34.738
The killing.

18:36.866 --> 18:38.033
Oh!

18:38.409 --> 18:39.701
Right. My fault.

18:41.495 --> 18:43.788
You know who we are,
don't you?

18:46.500 --> 18:47.834
Yes.

18:49.378 --> 18:51.046
You're the
Black Eyed Peas!

18:53.090 --> 18:54.966
Come on. Not again.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.928
Why does everyone
always think we're
the Black Eyed Peas?

18:58.012 --> 19:01.264
I mean, her, I get. I get it.
She looks just like Fergie.

19:01.349 --> 19:03.225
And he looks
like Will.i.am,

19:03.309 --> 19:05.977
but, Jesus Christ,
they don't even have
a white guy in their band!

19:09.815 --> 19:10.941
Ow!

19:13.069 --> 19:14.861
He hit me!
- That's right!

19:14.946 --> 19:18.907
Mixed martial arts,
Tae Bo,

19:18.991 --> 19:21.910
and Yogalates
created this!

19:21.994 --> 19:22.994
Huh?

19:34.465 --> 19:36.299
How you like that,
pretty boy? Huh?

19:45.268 --> 19:47.686
Get him off me!
Get him off me!

19:47.770 --> 19:48.979
Now the elbow!

19:52.316 --> 19:53.942
Son of a bitch!

19:55.778 --> 19:56.987
I am not afraid of you!

19:57.321 --> 19:58.697
You should be.

21:11.979 --> 21:16.649
Damn that overwrought
unrequited teenage love.

21:37.880 --> 21:41.341
I couldn't stop
thinking about Edward Sullen.

21:48.808 --> 21:51.017
Amazing dexterity.

21:52.895 --> 21:54.813
He can't be human.

21:56.899 --> 22:00.819
Meanwhile, uptown, Blair
was getting cozy with Nate,

22:00.903 --> 22:03.154
who was secretly
crushing on Serena.

22:03.239 --> 22:06.574
Excuse me, but you're
interrupting my narration.

22:06.659 --> 22:09.536
Oh, shit!
Wrong show!

22:10.121 --> 22:12.664
X-O-X-O, Gossip Girl.

22:12.998 --> 22:14.332
Becca!
Jacob.

22:14.416 --> 22:16.126
I heard about
the accident.
Are you okay?

22:16.210 --> 22:18.253
Yeah, I'm fine.

22:18.921 --> 22:20.046
I got you these.

22:36.564 --> 22:40.817
Thanks, Jacob.
You're so sweet
and thoughtful.

22:40.901 --> 22:42.610
Any girl would be
lucky to have you.

22:44.613 --> 22:48.032
Just not me, of course.
You're like my little
gay brother.

22:54.748 --> 22:56.332
I heard you were
hanging out with
Edward Sullen.

22:57.710 --> 23:00.879
Stay away from him.
There's just something
really odd about that guy.

23:01.755 --> 23:03.006
Becca!

23:04.967 --> 23:06.593
I'd better go.

23:14.643 --> 23:16.978
Hey, sweetheart.
There you are.

23:20.316 --> 23:21.316
There was
a killing today.

23:22.818 --> 23:24.569
Fisherman Sculley,
by the docks.

23:26.238 --> 23:27.488
The blood was drained
from his body

23:27.573 --> 23:30.116
and he had
multiple bite wounds
all over his neck.

23:30.201 --> 23:31.993
You know what
that means?

23:32.328 --> 23:33.620
The Kardashians
are in town.

23:35.206 --> 23:36.206
Here.

23:36.832 --> 23:38.666
I want you
to have this.

23:39.293 --> 23:41.294
Mace?
You're my little girl,

23:41.378 --> 23:42.754
and there's a killer
on the loose.

23:42.838 --> 23:45.215
I'm not gonna leave
until I know you can
protect yourself.

23:46.550 --> 23:50.011
Now,
I'm going to come at you,
and I want you to mace me.

23:50.095 --> 23:52.430
Dad...
Honey, I've been
trained for this, okay?

23:53.307 --> 23:54.766
Here I come.

23:56.769 --> 23:59.062
Good God!

23:59.146 --> 24:00.438
God damn it!

24:02.733 --> 24:05.777
It's so painful! It burns!

24:05.861 --> 24:07.528
Sorry, Dad.
No! I'm proud of you.

24:07.613 --> 24:09.197
Are you okay?

24:10.699 --> 24:13.243
Mace will only temporarily
stop your attacker.

24:13.327 --> 24:15.370
You have to hit a man
where he breathes, Becca.

24:22.378 --> 24:24.963
You got
the franks and beans there.
Good for you.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.341
But I'm still
coming at you.

24:30.886 --> 24:32.095
Rip off the moustache,
sweetheart.

24:32.179 --> 24:33.680
But you love
your moustache.

24:33.764 --> 24:36.599
If anything happened to you,
I could not live with myself.

24:36.684 --> 24:38.893
Do it! Do it! Do it!

24:43.399 --> 24:45.233
You're good to go.

25:06.755 --> 25:07.964
Edward?

25:08.507 --> 25:09.590
Uh...

25:13.887 --> 25:15.138
Am I dreaming?

25:15.472 --> 25:17.974
Right.
You're dreaming.

25:18.434 --> 25:19.976
So you're not
really here?

25:20.060 --> 25:21.227
Exactly.

25:21.395 --> 25:22.437
Go back to sleep.

25:23.272 --> 25:24.314
Yeah.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.245
Got to...

25:39.663 --> 25:41.622
Got to TiVo
Wizards of Waverly Place.

25:45.961 --> 25:48.087
PatrÃ³n! Mario LÃ³pez!

26:03.979 --> 26:05.730
Becca, you're
sleepwalking.

26:11.820 --> 26:13.029
Hey, you're sleepwalking.

26:35.177 --> 26:38.596
Just you breathing
is the greatest gift
you could give me.

26:50.025 --> 26:53.861
I started to wonder,
maybe I wasn't
dreaming after all.

26:53.946 --> 26:58.241
I had to figure out
the riddle.
Who was Edward Sullen?

26:58.325 --> 27:02.662
Was he human,
or something
different entirely?

27:04.081 --> 27:05.206
Oh, snap!

27:05.499 --> 27:07.125
He dropped his business card!

27:20.556 --> 27:22.473
Good morning,
Sporks High students!

27:22.558 --> 27:25.643
Tickets are now
on sale for prom.

27:25.727 --> 27:30.106
And after school today,
don't forget to visit
the quad for the blood drive

27:30.190 --> 27:33.693
generously sponsored
by the Sullen family.

27:38.073 --> 27:41.659
Prom! Come to prom!
Prom's almost here! Prom!

27:41.743 --> 27:44.162
Here! Get your
flyer for prom.

27:45.289 --> 27:46.330
Check it out.

27:46.415 --> 27:49.625
We finally got a theme.
It's gonna be awesome.

27:49.710 --> 27:51.627
The theme is vampires?

27:51.712 --> 27:52.920
We just came up
with it randomly!

27:53.005 --> 27:54.005
Cool, huh?

27:55.257 --> 27:56.841
It's gonna be like
the festival of
St. Salvatore,

27:56.925 --> 27:58.134
like the one they have
in Italy every year

27:58.218 --> 28:00.178
that celebrates
the killing of vampires.

28:00.262 --> 28:02.221
And we're renting out
a huge stone courtyard.

28:02.306 --> 28:04.557
It's gonna feel just like
we're in the 15th century.

28:04.641 --> 28:08.561
It should be super fun.
Lots of red capes,
blood and binge drinking!

28:10.606 --> 28:11.898
You in?

28:12.274 --> 28:15.943
I don't know.
Prom's really not my thing.

28:16.278 --> 28:20.615
Well, it's my thing.
I mean, really, Becca,
what is with you?

28:20.699 --> 28:22.742
Prom is, like,
the pivotal moment
in any girl's life.

28:22.826 --> 28:25.369
I've only been
dreaming about being
crowned prom queen

28:25.454 --> 28:28.039
since I was a sperm
in my dad's balls.

28:41.678 --> 28:43.387
We need to talk.

29:30.310 --> 29:32.603
Your skin is pale white.

29:33.188 --> 29:37.858
You dress fashionably.
And you abstain from sex.

29:39.194 --> 29:40.695
I know what you are.

29:41.572 --> 29:42.989
Say it.

29:44.283 --> 29:46.617
Out loud. Say it.

29:48.495 --> 29:49.745
Jonas brother.

29:49.830 --> 29:50.955
That's right.

29:53.208 --> 29:54.709
Wait, what?

29:55.168 --> 29:57.461
No, I'm a vampire. Duh.

29:58.213 --> 29:59.589
That was my next guess.

30:00.048 --> 30:03.718
Then ask yourself
the most obvious question.

30:04.428 --> 30:06.596
What do we like to eat?

30:09.057 --> 30:10.600
Vampire cereal?

30:14.271 --> 30:16.063
You need to see what
I really look like.

30:18.942 --> 30:21.068
This is why we don't
show ourselves
in the sunlight.

30:21.403 --> 30:22.987
People would know
we're different.

30:28.535 --> 30:31.120
You're shining.

30:32.581 --> 30:33.748
No, that's just my bling.

30:38.420 --> 30:40.963
You don't get it.
I am a killer!

30:49.848 --> 30:51.599
Are you texting?
Yeah, Jennifer.

30:59.107 --> 31:01.942
I am the world's most
dangerous predator.

31:07.949 --> 31:08.991
I want to eat you!

31:09.868 --> 31:11.702
That's cool.

31:11.787 --> 31:13.621
Most guys
aren't into that.

31:18.835 --> 31:23.089
My family, we're not
like other vampires.

31:23.673 --> 31:27.385
We can control our thirst
to only hunt animals

31:27.469 --> 31:29.929
and the Real Housewives
of Atlanta.

31:30.931 --> 31:34.100
But I don't know
if I can control
myself around you.

31:42.401 --> 31:44.402
Look, Ed.

31:45.570 --> 31:48.239
I don't like to
play games, so

31:49.825 --> 31:52.701
I'm just gonna lay
my cards on the table.

31:53.203 --> 31:55.538
I really like you.

31:56.998 --> 31:59.375
I dig the Eurotrash
heroin-chic look.

32:00.168 --> 32:02.711
You're totally happening,

32:04.506 --> 32:05.506
and I wanna be with you.

32:06.007 --> 32:09.093
I can read
everybody's minds
but yours.

32:09.177 --> 32:12.054
You have to tell me
exactly what
you're thinking.

32:13.890 --> 32:16.058
You're pretty,

32:17.018 --> 32:18.644
so you don't
have to be smart.

32:20.397 --> 32:22.064
Would you like to go
to the prom with me?

32:24.109 --> 32:25.276
Yes.

32:25.360 --> 32:26.485
That's awesome.

32:37.539 --> 32:41.292
There were three things
I was absolutely
positive about.

32:41.376 --> 32:44.128
First, Edward was a vampire.

32:44.212 --> 32:47.298
Second, American Idol
is gonna blow without Simon.

32:47.382 --> 32:49.884
And third,
the next time
I saw Edward,

32:49.968 --> 32:52.219
I was gonna hump
the shit out of him and...

32:52.304 --> 32:53.387
Boo.

32:53.847 --> 32:55.514
Oh, gosh, you scared me.

33:05.567 --> 33:07.109
There is something
that I wanted to try.

33:07.402 --> 33:09.945
Me, too.
I love role-playing.

33:16.912 --> 33:18.913
That's not what I meant.

33:26.421 --> 33:27.922
Don't move.

33:45.774 --> 33:49.735
Kiss me already.
I know it'll be okay.

34:06.086 --> 34:09.922
That was amazing.
I've never gone
to first base before.

34:10.297 --> 34:11.757
Now let's go
all the way.

34:18.974 --> 34:20.724
Purity ring.
Yeah.

34:30.527 --> 34:31.652
Oh!

34:32.320 --> 34:35.572
I won't be able
to resist my urges

34:36.366 --> 34:37.491
to kill you!

34:38.118 --> 34:39.827
I don't mind.
What?

34:41.121 --> 34:42.871
Oh, God!

34:44.331 --> 34:45.416
Becca, no!

34:52.507 --> 34:55.134
Oh, yeah?
I like it rough.

35:16.489 --> 35:17.448
Stay away from me.

35:17.532 --> 35:21.410
No, please, please, please,
don't come any closer!
This is for your own safety.

35:21.745 --> 35:23.454
I'm trying to protect you.

35:29.085 --> 35:30.336
Becca?

35:33.256 --> 35:34.340
Becca?

35:50.899 --> 35:54.234
If this is going to work,
we're gonna have to take
things slow.

35:55.695 --> 35:57.571
I guess that's okay.

35:58.406 --> 36:00.824
Even though my teen
hormones are raging

36:00.909 --> 36:02.076
and I want to
have sex with you,

36:03.078 --> 36:06.372
I feel conflicted
about losing my virginity.

36:07.666 --> 36:11.710
I know you'll never
have sex with me,
because you're a vampire,

36:11.795 --> 36:14.296
so, really,
it's the ultimate
pubescent girl fantasy.

36:16.424 --> 36:17.591
That was
incredibly insightful.

36:20.095 --> 36:23.263
I read it on
Stephenie Meyer's
Twitter page.

36:27.394 --> 36:30.979
Becca, I promise,
as long as you're with me,
you'll never get hurt.

36:47.580 --> 36:48.622
Starting now.

37:32.667 --> 37:34.001
Shit!

37:34.377 --> 37:37.629
Well, I think we all know
whatever killed Fisherman
Sculley was no animal.

37:37.964 --> 37:39.673
Look at those tracks.

37:40.133 --> 37:42.342
It could only mean
one thing.

37:42.427 --> 37:43.844
Canadians.

37:44.846 --> 37:46.263
Damn border-jumpers.

37:46.347 --> 37:50.684
They come here
and take all the shitty jobs
us lazy Americans don't want,

37:50.769 --> 37:52.603
and now they're killing
our fishermen, too.

37:53.104 --> 37:56.315
Yeah, Frank,
I think you're missing
the big picture.

38:01.946 --> 38:03.238
That is a big picture.

38:13.374 --> 38:15.167
It was
my 18th birthday,

38:15.251 --> 38:18.212
and the Sullens were
throwing me a party.

38:24.719 --> 38:26.553
Well, this is home.

38:31.017 --> 38:32.184
Hey.

38:33.561 --> 38:35.270
There is no reason
to be nervous.

38:37.398 --> 38:39.817
Well, I'm different
than you.

38:40.527 --> 38:41.735
They might not accept me.

38:44.572 --> 38:46.698
It's like the time
when my ex-boyfriend,
DeShawn,

38:46.783 --> 38:49.409
invited me to his
grandmama's house
to celebrate Kwanzaa.

38:58.169 --> 39:04.550
Dandelion, come where
the sunshine shines

39:04.843 --> 39:08.345
When you clock that second
And your heart starts ticking

39:08.429 --> 39:11.265
May it land on mine

39:11.933 --> 39:14.852
If we make it to space
I'll meet you

39:14.936 --> 39:16.812
Oh, my dandelion

39:16.896 --> 39:17.980
I want you
to meet my family.

39:19.190 --> 39:22.609
You must be Becca.
I'm Edward's mom, Eden.

39:22.694 --> 39:25.070
We've heard so much
about you.

39:25.405 --> 39:26.864
Finger food?

39:31.119 --> 39:32.578
That's Alex and Rosalyn.

39:35.540 --> 39:37.916
I just know we're going
to be great, great friends.

39:38.001 --> 39:39.751
And this is Iris.

39:42.338 --> 39:43.338
I hope we will be.

39:43.423 --> 39:45.382
No, she already knows
it will happen.

39:45.466 --> 39:48.051
Some of us have
special powers.

39:48.136 --> 39:49.553
Iris has visions
of the future.

39:49.637 --> 39:50.637
Oh!

39:54.142 --> 39:55.434
But I'm not on my period.

39:55.935 --> 39:58.312
You will be.
It's coming early
this month.

40:01.983 --> 40:03.191
Relax, Becca.

40:03.276 --> 40:05.986
We're just like any other
normal American family.

40:06.362 --> 40:08.113
Except, of course,
we have no souls,

40:08.197 --> 40:09.698
and we walk the earth
trying to satisfy

40:09.782 --> 40:12.159
an unquenchable
thirst for blood.

40:16.915 --> 40:18.123
I'm Jeremiah.

40:18.207 --> 40:20.667
He's new
to the family.

40:21.377 --> 40:23.712
He's still trying
to control his hunger
for humans.

40:37.435 --> 40:41.104
Look, I don't want
to cause any problems.
Maybe I should go.

40:41.189 --> 40:43.774
But you have to
open your presents.

40:47.528 --> 40:48.695
Ow!

40:49.530 --> 40:50.864
Paper cut.

41:14.847 --> 41:16.014
You're bleeding.

41:16.391 --> 41:18.976
Really bad, actually.
I must have hit an artery.

41:58.516 --> 42:00.142
Becca, your nose!

42:00.226 --> 42:04.062
I knew I shouldn't
have partied last night
with Lindsay Lohan.

42:07.108 --> 42:10.110
Every time
I bring a girl home,
you guys try to eat her!

42:11.988 --> 42:13.572
It's not fair!
Come on!

42:16.534 --> 42:18.744
Someone here
order Chinese food?

42:21.289 --> 42:24.541
Quick,
they'll be hungry again
in half an hour.

43:04.582 --> 43:09.044
What happened back there
can never happen again.

43:12.006 --> 43:15.717
I now know,
as long as I'm around you
you'll never be safe.

43:16.594 --> 43:20.555
That's why I want you
to bite me, and turn me
into a vampire.

43:20.973 --> 43:21.932
No.

43:22.016 --> 43:24.434
I keep aging and
you stay the same.

43:24.519 --> 43:27.562
I'm 18 now.
I'm practically a cougar.

43:32.360 --> 43:33.860
I just...

43:34.529 --> 43:38.782
I couldn't live with myself
if I turned you
into a vampire.

43:39.951 --> 43:44.746
You're always
sexy and healthy,
and super good-looking,

43:44.831 --> 43:48.250
with tons of free time
and money to travel the world.

43:48.334 --> 43:50.544
It's a lot like being
George Clooney.

43:51.963 --> 43:56.174
Strangely,
the only thing that does
keep aging is your ass.

43:59.095 --> 44:00.720
It gets pretty
wrinkly over time.

44:05.309 --> 44:07.894
You'll never
see me again.

44:07.979 --> 44:13.275
Just promise me
that you won't do
anything reckless.

44:16.821 --> 44:20.073
Okay. I promise
I won't date Chris Brown.

44:54.358 --> 44:56.318
Farewell.

45:02.783 --> 45:04.117
Edward?

45:06.954 --> 45:08.955
Edward! Edward!

45:14.921 --> 45:16.087
Edward!

45:18.716 --> 45:20.634
You're just gonna leave me
here alone in woods

45:20.718 --> 45:22.802
in an area
filled with vampires
who want to eat me?

46:02.760 --> 46:04.678
Looks like Edward
left us a treat.

46:12.186 --> 46:14.854
Great. This is exactly
what I was talking about.

46:16.190 --> 46:17.315
Take that!

46:23.739 --> 46:26.241
I came here to
help you, bitch!

46:27.243 --> 46:28.326
Sorry.

46:28.411 --> 46:30.495
There's nowhere
else to run.

46:30.579 --> 46:33.081
Your beloved Edward
isn't here to save you.

46:48.347 --> 46:49.431
Hmm?

46:59.567 --> 47:02.569
Come on, Jack.
Where's the bro code, huh?

47:03.195 --> 47:04.904
You know you don't try
to eat someone's girlfriend

47:04.989 --> 47:07.532
right after they
break up with them.

47:27.636 --> 47:29.054
Kardashians.

47:29.138 --> 47:31.264
Jack, no!

47:35.019 --> 47:36.770
Let's go!

47:44.320 --> 47:45.653
Becca.

47:46.947 --> 47:49.074
I'm going to have to suck
the venom out of you.

47:49.158 --> 47:51.868
This is going to
be tough for me

47:51.952 --> 47:55.288
because the taste
of your blood could
send me into a frenzy.

47:57.792 --> 47:58.875
But on the other hand...

47:58.959 --> 48:00.001
Just do it already!

48:05.925 --> 48:07.634
Okay, Edward,

48:07.760 --> 48:09.594
I think you got
all the venom out.

48:09.678 --> 48:11.012
You can stop now.

48:38.332 --> 48:41.501
And just like that,
Edward was gone.

48:45.089 --> 48:49.342
I just couldn't get over him.
Why did he have to leave me?

48:50.469 --> 48:52.846
And the rain is pouring down

48:59.061 --> 49:03.606
And the tears are falling
But they never make...

49:03.691 --> 49:05.150
Time passed,

49:05.484 --> 49:07.861
but my yearning for Edward
never subsided.

49:07.945 --> 49:09.362
Everyone reminded me of him.

49:15.536 --> 49:17.412
I couldn't get
Edward out of my mind.

49:24.670 --> 49:26.129
No matter where I looked.

49:34.680 --> 49:35.972
No matter what I saw.

49:39.768 --> 49:44.898
Without Edward,
my life was over.
I felt like dying.

49:45.733 --> 49:47.650
And every night,
I had nightmares

49:47.735 --> 49:50.778
that would make me scream
really, really loud.

50:00.498 --> 50:04.209
Becca. Becca. Becca.
Becca! Becca! Becca!

50:05.002 --> 50:06.669
You're so upset.

50:07.421 --> 50:09.255
Let me check
your levels.

50:13.052 --> 50:15.220
Oh. That's not good.

50:15.304 --> 50:19.390
You've got more angst
than The Secret Life of
the American Teenager.

50:19.475 --> 50:22.936
You know, honey,
I'm not real good at the
whole parenting thing.

50:23.479 --> 50:26.981
But I do know that
breakups are hard.

50:27.316 --> 50:28.775
Especially when
you're dumped by someone

50:28.859 --> 50:30.610
as handsome
and hunky as Edward.

50:31.654 --> 50:33.905
That boy can really
fill out a pair of pants.

50:33.989 --> 50:39.160
I'm like,
"Mmm! Look at that!
Look at that!"

50:41.455 --> 50:42.705
Yeah.

50:42.790 --> 50:46.793
And let's face it, honey.
You're no looker.
And you twitch a lot.

50:46.877 --> 50:48.878
It's kind of irritating.

50:49.755 --> 50:51.965
That's for sure
the best piece of ass
you'll ever get.

50:54.718 --> 50:56.177
My advice,

50:56.262 --> 51:00.390
get yourself some of
those big, juicy
onion-butt implants.

51:00.474 --> 51:02.475
Fix your hair up
pretty like BeyoncÃ©

51:02.560 --> 51:05.895
and,
who knows, honey, maybe
a black guy will do you.

51:08.357 --> 51:09.983
That's my girl.

51:12.319 --> 51:13.403
Oh!

51:13.779 --> 51:16.698
Your friend Jennifer
keeps calling.
You should hang out with her.

51:16.782 --> 51:18.491
Probably cheer you up.

51:19.785 --> 51:21.411
I want you to say good night
to your new mommy.

51:22.162 --> 51:27.792
Good night, Becca.
I love you. I love you.

51:28.752 --> 51:29.961
She really does.

51:31.005 --> 51:35.842
Well, we're gonna get busy.
Good night, sweetheart.

51:39.596 --> 51:43.725
I don't get it.
Why would anyone want
to date a vampire? Lame.

51:43.809 --> 51:46.269
Yeah. So lame.

51:46.353 --> 51:48.438
That movie's
totally going to flop.

51:53.527 --> 51:56.612
I can't believe
they get married
and have a vampire baby.

51:57.990 --> 52:00.366
Thanks for
the spoiler alert,
dumbshit!

52:07.374 --> 52:08.875
It's too bad Edward
dumped you

52:08.959 --> 52:10.710
and now you don't have
a date for the prom.

52:11.128 --> 52:14.255
'Cause that dress
would have looked
great on you.

52:14.965 --> 52:16.424
But you don't
need a dress,

52:16.508 --> 52:20.386
because Edward
left you behind
in the woods like bear shit.

52:21.347 --> 52:23.681
So I'm going
to wear it instead!

52:24.892 --> 52:28.311
And check this out.
Everyone's going to be,
like, super jealous.

52:28.395 --> 52:30.229
Couldn't you just die?

52:30.856 --> 52:32.357
No.

52:32.816 --> 52:33.941
But you can.

52:42.993 --> 52:45.578
Well, this is me.
Where are you parked?

52:45.871 --> 52:47.163
Uh...

52:47.247 --> 52:48.706
Over there.

52:51.418 --> 52:53.461
Ooh!

52:53.921 --> 52:57.256
Right next to those mean
and scary biker dudes?

52:59.510 --> 53:01.636
See you at school tomorrow!

53:20.280 --> 53:23.741
Hey, baby! Come over here!
You can sit on my bike.

53:27.287 --> 53:30.623
Becca. Those guys
are dangerous. Walk away.

53:30.707 --> 53:31.958
Edward?

53:33.460 --> 53:34.794
Ow!

53:34.878 --> 53:38.131
Shit. Those guys
are dangerous.

53:38.799 --> 53:40.049
Told you.

53:53.439 --> 53:57.150
This is your brake.
And this is your throttle.

53:58.444 --> 54:00.319
Jacob, there's...

54:01.447 --> 54:05.658
There's something
different about you.
I don't know what it is.

54:07.453 --> 54:10.496
I've been
meaning to tell you.
I'm a man now, Becca.

54:11.999 --> 54:14.917
Are you telling me that...
That's right.

54:15.419 --> 54:17.295
I've had my bar mitzvah.

54:17.379 --> 54:19.130
Mazel tov!

54:23.010 --> 54:25.178
So will you date me now?

54:26.013 --> 54:28.264
Say again?
I couldn't hear you.

54:28.348 --> 54:30.099
Right.

54:30.684 --> 54:32.852
Will you go on a date
with... No, no.
What?

54:33.604 --> 54:35.688
Maybe if you'd stop
revving the bike

54:35.772 --> 54:39.358
whenever I'm about to ask
you something really
important, you'd hear me.

54:40.360 --> 54:42.028
Right. Sorry.

54:42.654 --> 54:44.197
Thank you.

54:44.698 --> 54:47.158
Becca, I wanted to ask
if you would just...

54:47.242 --> 54:48.868
Oh, come on!

54:48.952 --> 54:50.870
Becca, will you go
on a date with me?

54:52.206 --> 54:55.708
Sorry, but I don't like
to be yelled at, Jacob.

54:57.753 --> 55:02.256
I think I'll just
take her for a spin.
Just one thing first.

55:03.008 --> 55:05.426
Becca, you just
cut the brake line!

55:12.935 --> 55:15.520
Becca, stop.
You're going
to hurt yourself.

55:22.569 --> 55:25.655
Hey, Eddy
Well, I know
it might seem petty

55:25.739 --> 55:28.950
But I can't stop
obsessing over you

55:29.326 --> 55:32.328
Put down that guitar
and stop singing
like Taylor Swift.

55:34.623 --> 55:37.500
If this is what
it takes to be with you,
Edward, so be it.

55:37.584 --> 55:40.503
Becca! Don't drink that milk.

55:41.046 --> 55:42.672
You know
you're lactose
intolerant.

55:42.756 --> 55:44.924
This is for you, Edward.

55:49.263 --> 55:50.388
Oh, God.

55:55.852 --> 55:58.396
Sorry. But I did
try to warn you.

55:59.273 --> 56:00.565
Becca!

56:04.319 --> 56:05.528
Are you trying to get
yourself killed?

56:05.612 --> 56:06.862
Uh-huh.

56:07.948 --> 56:10.533
You're bleeding. Here.

56:14.621 --> 56:17.164
Your body is so...

56:18.250 --> 56:19.584
...furry.

56:22.462 --> 56:23.713
Are those teats?

56:23.797 --> 56:25.965
Yeah, 10 of them, actually.

56:27.259 --> 56:28.384
Oh!

56:29.970 --> 56:32.263
I'd better go
get you some help.

56:34.891 --> 56:36.392
That was fast.

56:39.646 --> 56:42.982
You are so scrumptious.

56:47.696 --> 56:48.946
No!

56:56.038 --> 56:59.206
Be happy it was me
that found you
and not Rachel.

56:59.291 --> 57:01.709
Why? What happened
to Rachel?

57:01.793 --> 57:03.336
She was...

57:03.962 --> 57:05.296
...recast.

57:08.884 --> 57:10.134
Shh!

57:11.345 --> 57:15.139
She wants to torture you
for what you did to Jack.

57:15.641 --> 57:18.684
At least I will
eat you fast.

57:21.188 --> 57:23.064
Becca!
Jacob, run!

57:29.029 --> 57:31.197
That's it?
A Chihuahua?

57:31.573 --> 57:35.951
Yeah, I guess so.
This whole transformation
thing is new to me.

57:36.286 --> 57:39.872
You can't stop me.
You're no werewolf.

57:40.207 --> 57:42.208
That's why I always
travel in a pack.

57:58.392 --> 58:00.101
It's raining men

58:00.811 --> 58:03.396
Hallelujah
It's raining men

58:04.272 --> 58:05.272
Amen

58:06.024 --> 58:09.735
I'm gonna go out
I'm gonna let myself get

58:10.237 --> 58:13.614
Absolutely soaking wet

58:14.116 --> 58:15.908
It's raining men

58:16.535 --> 58:19.161
Hallelujah
It's raining men

58:19.996 --> 58:21.163
Amen

58:21.248 --> 58:22.998
It's raining men, yeah

58:23.542 --> 58:24.959
Please.

58:25.085 --> 58:26.544
Get him, girls!

58:59.619 --> 59:00.619
Hey.

59:05.959 --> 59:07.293
Sign this?

59:19.306 --> 59:21.849
Now, let's get you home.

59:26.980 --> 59:30.399
You'll be all right now.
I know it's worked!

59:43.330 --> 59:45.998
Why can't they
just be together?

59:54.007 --> 59:56.842
There you are!
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

59:59.346 --> 01:00:00.679
You look like shit.

01:00:00.764 --> 01:00:02.056
What do you want?

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:06.769
Look, we're all sorry
we tried to drink Becca's
blood, even Jeremiah.

01:00:06.853 --> 01:00:09.730
But something terrible
has happened to her.

01:00:14.194 --> 01:00:17.822
Becca who?
I am totally over her.

01:00:17.906 --> 01:00:20.783
I've moved on. I am done
with normal chicks.

01:00:20.867 --> 01:00:23.410
I've finally found
someone as freaky as me.

01:00:24.663 --> 01:00:27.414
My first wish
Turn the music up
as loud as it gets

01:00:27.541 --> 01:00:31.502
My second wish
Me and the girls are
in the hottest outfits

01:00:31.586 --> 01:00:32.670
My third wish

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:35.339
Too freaky?

01:00:35.423 --> 01:00:40.219
Edward, I had a vision!
Becca was riding a motorcycle.

01:00:42.097 --> 01:00:43.931
She tried to kill herself.

01:00:49.187 --> 01:00:51.564
I fear Becca may be dead.

01:00:56.611 --> 01:00:57.778
No.

01:00:59.155 --> 01:01:01.031
I've got to find out.

01:01:03.994 --> 01:01:07.830
How do you feel?
It's Edward, isn't it?

01:01:11.418 --> 01:01:12.543
Here.

01:01:22.596 --> 01:01:25.306
Why did you just
take off your shirt?

01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:29.059
My contract says
I have to every
10 minutes of screen time.

01:01:30.854 --> 01:01:31.937
Hmm.

01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:48.746
Look, Edward left you.

01:01:50.123 --> 01:01:54.209
But I would never do that.
I want to take it
out of the friend zone.

01:01:55.086 --> 01:01:56.754
I really like you, Becca.

01:01:57.714 --> 01:01:59.423
I like you, too.

01:02:00.967 --> 01:02:07.348
When I'm with you,
I just feel
so safe and secure.

01:02:08.850 --> 01:02:10.017
Thanks.

01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:13.395
As opposed to how
I feel about Edward,

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:18.275
which is all passion,
lust, complete
forbidden fruit stuff.

01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:20.819
I mean, with him,
it's all about my pussy.

01:02:21.112 --> 01:02:22.738
Okay!

01:02:24.991 --> 01:02:25.991
Do you mind getting that?

01:02:27.202 --> 01:02:28.327
Sure.

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:34.458
Hello.

01:02:34.542 --> 01:02:35.876
Officer Crane?

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:37.086
No, he's not
here right now.

01:02:38.004 --> 01:02:41.173
Where is he?
It is very important
that I speak with him.

01:02:48.348 --> 01:02:50.140
He's at the funeral.

01:02:51.309 --> 01:02:52.685
Oh, God, no.
Yeah.

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:54.770
And supposedly,
the body was so mangled

01:02:54.854 --> 01:02:56.355
that the undertaker
had to use Krazy Glue

01:02:56.439 --> 01:02:59.191
to stick the head
back on and put marbles
where the eyes once were.

01:03:03.321 --> 01:03:05.197
Hello? Hello?

01:03:12.205 --> 01:03:13.706
It's true.

01:03:15.041 --> 01:03:16.208
Becca's dead.

01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:18.919
Edward, I'm so sorry.

01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:23.841
I can't live without her.

01:03:26.678 --> 01:03:30.556
Goodbye, Iris.
I'm going to kill myself.

01:03:40.108 --> 01:03:42.776
I just had another
vision about Becca!

01:03:43.153 --> 01:03:47.489
Becca's fine.
You don't have to
kill yourself anymore.

01:03:49.868 --> 01:03:51.243
Edward!

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:54.830
Shit.

01:04:02.839 --> 01:04:04.673
Prom rocks!

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:09.094
I love drinking!

01:04:09.387 --> 01:04:10.387
Oh!

01:04:10.472 --> 01:04:14.016
What's the matter, Becca?
Still no date for the prom?

01:04:14.768 --> 01:04:16.185
Loser!

01:04:17.395 --> 01:04:19.438
Here, have a drink, bitch!

01:04:20.648 --> 01:04:25.152
She promised me
sex tonight!
High point of my life!

01:04:31.659 --> 01:04:34.411
Becca! Get in the car, now!

01:04:46.758 --> 01:04:49.176
What's wrong?
Edward thinks
you're dead.

01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:51.303
Why would he think that?

01:04:52.138 --> 01:04:53.555
Um...

01:04:56.142 --> 01:04:58.227
Beats me.

01:04:58.311 --> 01:05:01.146
He won't live without you
and he wants to die.

01:05:01.856 --> 01:05:03.190
He's such a romantic.

01:05:05.151 --> 01:05:06.735
Becca!
Jacob?

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:09.613
Becca, don't go.
You belong with me.

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:10.823
Oh!

01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:15.661
I need to know,
who's it going to be?
Is it going to be me or him?

01:05:16.663 --> 01:05:17.746
Jacob, I...

01:05:17.831 --> 01:05:19.414
I'm not gonna take
no for an answer.

01:05:19.499 --> 01:05:23.627
I'm not going to let go
until you tell me,
once and for all.

01:05:23.711 --> 01:05:27.297
All right!
Jacob, I'll tell you.

01:05:30.343 --> 01:05:32.177
I choose...

01:05:32.262 --> 01:05:33.387
Cat!

01:05:36.474 --> 01:05:38.350
Come back here, pussy!

01:05:40.854 --> 01:05:43.146
Edward is going
to the Zolturi
to have them kill him.

01:05:43.231 --> 01:05:44.982
I saw it. I had a vision.

01:05:45.066 --> 01:05:47.651
What are you talking about?
Who are the Zolturi?

01:05:47.735 --> 01:05:50.487
They are the evil
bloodsuckers who only
care about themselves

01:05:50.572 --> 01:05:52.823
and their own narrow
vision of the world.

01:05:52.907 --> 01:05:54.741
They're kind of
like Fox News.

01:05:54.993 --> 01:05:55.951
Oh, my God.

01:05:56.035 --> 01:05:58.161
Edward's going
to expose himself
in the sunlight,

01:05:58.246 --> 01:06:00.622
and the Zolturi
are going to kill him.

01:06:00.707 --> 01:06:03.625
They can't allow humans
to know vampires
live among them.

01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:04.793
It could destroy us.

01:06:04.878 --> 01:06:06.795
Okay, where is this
going to happen?

01:06:07.046 --> 01:06:08.046
At the prom.

01:06:09.591 --> 01:06:12.759
The Zolturi never miss
a good St. Salvatore Day
festival.

01:06:12.844 --> 01:06:14.970
They flew all the way
in from Italy.

01:06:15.054 --> 01:06:18.265
Say what you want
about them, but they
do know how to party.

01:06:18.558 --> 01:06:21.310
Suck! Suck! Suck!
Suck! Suck! Suck!

01:06:33.323 --> 01:06:34.907
Oh! I got skills, bitch.

01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:40.120
Welcome,
Sporks High students,
to the 2010 prom.

01:06:48.254 --> 01:06:50.923
And don't forget,
the main event is
coming up shortly.

01:06:51.341 --> 01:06:54.968
The crowning of your
prom king and queen.

01:06:55.303 --> 01:06:56.887
And if you haven't had
a chance to vote yet,

01:06:56.971 --> 01:06:58.764
don't worry,
there's still time.

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:00.599
Just to be sure.

01:07:07.231 --> 01:07:09.566
Becca, you're the only one
that can stop Edward.

01:07:09.651 --> 01:07:11.735
You have to show him
you're still alive.

01:07:12.111 --> 01:07:13.946
I'll do whatever it takes.

01:07:20.495 --> 01:07:23.830
So, what would you do
to save someone you love?

01:07:25.667 --> 01:07:28.877
For Edward,
I would stop at nothing.

01:07:31.714 --> 01:07:32.714
Whoa.

01:07:32.799 --> 01:07:36.635
You already saw
this part, so let's get
to what happens next.

01:07:51.651 --> 01:07:52.818
No!

01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:58.824
Edward!

01:08:05.832 --> 01:08:07.082
Shit!

01:08:18.344 --> 01:08:19.594
Uh-oh.

01:08:28.354 --> 01:08:29.688
Edward!

01:08:39.532 --> 01:08:43.410
Edward, it's not sunny
anymore. It's twilight.

01:08:45.121 --> 01:08:46.246
Hey, new moon.

01:08:48.875 --> 01:08:50.625
Ah! Eclipse?

01:08:51.210 --> 01:08:52.794
Look at me, everyone!

01:08:55.423 --> 01:08:58.759
This is me
in all my glory.

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:07.058
Lucky penny.

01:09:09.437 --> 01:09:10.645
Oh!

01:09:13.566 --> 01:09:14.733
Huh?

01:09:17.028 --> 01:09:18.236
Edward!

01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:27.328
Becca? You're alive?

01:09:35.296 --> 01:09:37.046
We have to go now.

01:09:45.389 --> 01:09:47.599
Becca, I am so sorry.

01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:50.560
I promise you
that I will never
leave you again.

01:09:52.897 --> 01:09:54.731
The Zolturi are standing
right behind me, aren't they?

01:09:55.650 --> 01:09:57.275
Yep.
Don't worry, Becca.

01:09:59.237 --> 01:10:01.822
Not talking
smack now, are we?

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:03.657
Stop it!
"Stop it!"

01:10:03.741 --> 01:10:05.242
You're killing him!
"You're killing him!"

01:10:05.326 --> 01:10:07.035
And we haven't
even had sex yet.

01:10:07.119 --> 01:10:09.079
"And we haven't
even had sex..."

01:10:09.455 --> 01:10:10.956
Really?

01:10:11.290 --> 01:10:13.041
Even...

01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:15.710
Oh!

01:10:44.156 --> 01:10:46.908
Becca. Becca.

01:10:47.285 --> 01:10:48.577
Oh! Dad.

01:10:49.412 --> 01:10:51.246
There you are.
I was worried
about my little girl.

01:10:51.330 --> 01:10:54.249
You know, there's still
a killer on the loose.

01:10:54.333 --> 01:10:56.918
But I can see you're dancing
with your friends,
so everything's all right.

01:10:57.003 --> 01:10:58.003
Dad, no...

01:10:58.087 --> 01:10:59.379
No, Frank, wait.

01:10:59.463 --> 01:11:01.590
You have to know
the truth.

01:11:01.674 --> 01:11:04.885
All of the killing
was done by vampires.

01:11:07.597 --> 01:11:08.763
Edward's one, also.

01:11:10.433 --> 01:11:11.766
And Bobby White's
a werewolf.

01:11:12.018 --> 01:11:13.393
Oh, oh...

01:11:13.477 --> 01:11:14.978
Ow!
Sorry.

01:11:15.062 --> 01:11:17.063
I understand.
Thank God.

01:11:17.523 --> 01:11:20.442
The theme of the prom!

01:11:22.445 --> 01:11:23.570
No, Dad.

01:11:23.654 --> 01:11:24.696
Enjoy, okay?

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:27.198
Becca, by the way,
thanks for everything.

01:11:35.082 --> 01:11:38.084
All through the night

01:11:41.047 --> 01:11:44.466
Too close. Separate,
arms length apart.

01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:48.553
Too close. Separate,
arms length apart.

01:11:51.057 --> 01:11:55.185
Too close. Separate!
Arms length apart!

01:11:59.106 --> 01:12:00.315
Hmm.

01:12:06.405 --> 01:12:07.906
Say cheese.

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:15.538
Say cheese.

01:12:30.763 --> 01:12:31.972
Whoo!

01:12:34.725 --> 01:12:35.934
What...

01:12:37.103 --> 01:12:38.186
...the hell?

01:12:48.781 --> 01:12:49.823
Oh!

01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:59.666
Where's Becca?

01:13:08.467 --> 01:13:13.555
Surrender now,
or Salvatore will snap
her neck like a Slim Jim.

01:13:20.813 --> 01:13:23.440
You must pay for
exposing yourself.

01:13:26.736 --> 01:13:30.321
Tell you what
I'm going to do,
Ed-to-the-ward.

01:13:30.406 --> 01:13:35.160
I won't kill you.
But Becca has to
become a vampire.

01:13:35.453 --> 01:13:36.536
Cool?

01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:39.748
No, not cool.
No way! Never!

01:13:39.832 --> 01:13:42.459
All right.
Pull Edward's head off,

01:13:42.543 --> 01:13:45.837
then rip his body apart
and set him on fire.

01:13:46.464 --> 01:13:48.757
No, no, no.
I mean, yes!
I meant yes!

01:13:48.841 --> 01:13:51.593
Of course,
she would love to
become a vampire.

01:13:51.677 --> 01:13:54.888
She practically brings it up
all the time. Right, hon?

01:13:55.139 --> 01:13:56.848
Uh, I guess so.

01:13:57.224 --> 01:13:58.600
Then bite her now!

01:13:59.727 --> 01:14:01.061
Bite!

01:14:14.325 --> 01:14:16.576
Listen up, people!
May I have your attention?

01:14:17.453 --> 01:14:20.538
And now the moment
you've all been waiting for.

01:14:20.956 --> 01:14:27.629
And this year's
Sporks High prom king
and prom queen is...

01:14:29.048 --> 01:14:30.256
...Jennifer and Rick!

01:14:35.554 --> 01:14:37.222
Triumph for the Rick!

01:14:40.226 --> 01:14:41.601
Congratulations.

01:14:43.062 --> 01:14:44.896
Thank you!
Yeah!

01:14:45.356 --> 01:14:46.481
Oh!

01:14:47.233 --> 01:14:48.483
Hold on!

01:14:48.567 --> 01:14:53.988
It seems you two received
over 69,000 votes

01:14:54.073 --> 01:14:55.949
in a class of only 300.

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:02.997
I'm afraid
you're disqualified.

01:15:03.082 --> 01:15:04.582
What?

01:15:05.084 --> 01:15:06.084
Oh!

01:15:06.168 --> 01:15:09.420
God! You asswipe!

01:15:11.757 --> 01:15:14.092
My life is over!

01:15:15.427 --> 01:15:20.932
As your principal,
I will nominate a new
prom king and queen.

01:15:22.184 --> 01:15:26.354
And I will pick...
I will... Let me see.

01:15:26.438 --> 01:15:28.439
I will choose...

01:15:28.524 --> 01:15:30.525
I pick you two!

01:15:36.448 --> 01:15:38.074
Us?
Yes!

01:15:38.158 --> 01:15:42.036
Because you two exemplify
what's best about
this whole prom.

01:15:42.121 --> 01:15:45.039
I mean, you really look
like a couple of mean,

01:15:45.124 --> 01:15:47.625
evil bloodsucking vampires.

01:15:52.506 --> 01:15:56.134
Oh, my God!
We won! We won!

01:15:57.511 --> 01:15:59.137
Yes, yes, yes!

01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:03.391
Move. Out of the way.

01:16:13.485 --> 01:16:14.485
Oh!

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:19.574
Edward!

01:16:20.993 --> 01:16:22.994
Bite. Bite.

01:16:29.668 --> 01:16:31.002
Do it.

01:16:32.713 --> 01:16:34.213
Bite me now.

01:16:36.842 --> 01:16:40.011
I don't want to wait
a second longer.

01:16:42.389 --> 01:16:47.602
I will only turn you
into a vampire
on one condition.

01:16:50.189 --> 01:16:51.522
Marry me.

01:16:56.403 --> 01:16:57.528
Yes.

01:17:05.996 --> 01:17:07.622
Are you ready?

01:17:43.283 --> 01:17:44.283
How do you feel?

01:17:44.952 --> 01:17:46.244
Perfect.

01:17:47.413 --> 01:17:50.540
It's how I always imagined.

01:17:52.126 --> 01:17:53.334
I love you, Becca...

01:17:57.256 --> 01:17:58.631
Team Jacob, bitch!

01:18:20.279 --> 01:18:21.821
Fuck me.

01:18:25.117 --> 01:18:26.743
If I was your vampire

01:18:26.827 --> 01:18:29.746
Slim as the moon

01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:31.748
Instead of killing time

01:18:31.832 --> 01:18:35.418
We'll have each other
till the sun

01:18:35.502 --> 01:18:38.963
If I was your vampire

01:18:39.423 --> 01:18:41.966
Death waits for no one

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:46.554
Put my hands across your face

01:18:46.805 --> 01:18:50.516
Because I think
our time has come

01:18:56.815 --> 01:19:01.235
Digging your smile apart
with my spade tongue

01:19:01.487 --> 01:19:05.323
And the hole
is where the heart is

01:19:05.491 --> 01:19:10.661
We built this tomb together
I will fill it alone

01:19:11.497 --> 01:19:14.290
Beyond the pale

01:19:15.667 --> 01:19:20.338
Everything's black
No turning back

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:25.343
If I was your vampire

01:19:25.511 --> 01:19:28.179
Slim as the moon

01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:30.807
Instead of killing time

01:19:30.891 --> 01:19:34.352
We'll have each other
till the sun

01:19:34.645 --> 01:19:38.106
If I was your vampire

01:19:38.315 --> 01:19:41.150
Death waits for no one

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:45.404
Put my hands across your face

01:19:45.531 --> 01:19:49.158
Because I think
our time has come

01:19:49.326 --> 01:19:51.828
Beyond the pale

01:19:53.413 --> 01:19:58.167
Everything's black
No turning back, no

01:20:01.839 --> 01:20:04.549
Beyond the pale

01:20:06.051 --> 01:20:10.346
Everything's black
No turning back, no

01:20:25.737 --> 01:20:28.447
I feel so lonely

01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:31.409
Nobody gets me

01:20:31.702 --> 01:20:36.122
I am so unhappy

01:20:37.749 --> 01:20:43.004
Why can't I find a cool
alternative boyfriend

01:20:44.464 --> 01:20:48.759
who understands me?

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:52.430
We can watch the classics

01:20:52.723 --> 01:20:55.266

Sexting dirty pics
of me in my panties

01:22:05.379 --> 01:22:07.922
My panties, my panties

01:22:14.888 --> 01:22:16.472
I'm the one
who's always thinking about

01:22:16.556 --> 01:22:19.141
All the ways
to get to the end of it

01:22:19.226 --> 01:22:21.686
You came around
And I think that I found

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:24.272
A good reason
to try and sit with it

01:22:24.356 --> 01:22:26.899
You're taking me down
But I like the sound

01:22:26.984 --> 01:22:29.402
And I want to get
with you anyway

01:22:29.486 --> 01:22:31.779
Is this solid ground
Or am I getting drowned?

01:22:31.863 --> 01:22:34.865
I'm just as happy
taking it day by day

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:39.620
And in the end
We all end up the same

01:22:39.997 --> 01:22:44.709
Love and desire
Will be you once again

01:22:45.043 --> 01:22:49.839
Life, listen and sing
We all end up the same

01:22:50.215 --> 01:22:55.052
And in the end
It all goes up in flames

01:22:59.975 --> 01:23:02.601
Scars on the skin
You're bringing me in

01:23:02.686 --> 01:23:05.187
And I'm closer, closer
Every minute

01:23:05.272 --> 01:23:07.606
We'll start to spin
And I'm in it to win

01:23:07.691 --> 01:23:10.234
And I'm taking
every last bit of it

01:23:10.319 --> 01:23:12.653
Looking at your face
Making my heart race

01:23:12.738 --> 01:23:15.239
And I can't seem
Can't seem to make it stop

01:23:15.324 --> 01:23:17.825
Sitting by your side
Want to go for a ride

01:23:17.909 --> 01:23:20.661
And I'm waiting
Waiting for you to drive

01:23:20.746 --> 01:23:25.750
And in the end
We all end up the same

01:23:25.917 --> 01:23:31.005
Love and desire
Will be almost plain

01:23:31.089 --> 01:23:36.052
Life, listen and sing
We all end up the same

01:23:36.136 --> 01:23:41.057
And in the end
It all goes up in flames
