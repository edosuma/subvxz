00:02.786 --> 00:04.670
Gloria hernandez,
residential burglary,

00:04.705 --> 00:06.171
grand theft, gun possession.

00:06.207 --> 00:07.139
She's a real peach.

00:07.174 --> 00:09.124
My sister is all that matters.

<i> When our parents died,</i>

00:10.461 --> 00:12.761

-[emily]<i> yeah.</i>

00:13.981 --> 00:15.347
Could you keep an eye
on maddy for me?

00:15.399 --> 00:16.432
Absolutely.

00:16.467 --> 00:18.317
-Lola?
-Dre?

00:18.352 --> 00:20.019
Andre is your dre.

00:20.071 --> 00:21.987
Love of your life
from college, dre?

00:22.023 --> 00:23.689
Andre armstrong's in town.

00:23.741 --> 00:24.773
Do you even remember him?

00:24.808 --> 00:27.026
I remember he was a damn fool.

I can't remember
the last time deliberations

00:44.828 --> 00:46.962
for a murder trial
came back this fast.

00:47.831 --> 00:50.182
Uh, it's usually
not a great sign.

00:50.217 --> 00:51.550
For my clients anyway.

[sighs]

01:01.062 --> 01:02.127

01:02.163 --> 01:04.730
I'm glad I got glowing reviews
from your co-workers

01:04.782 --> 01:06.231
but I needed
to see the place first

01:06.283 --> 01:07.733
and I would appreciate
being kept in loop.

01:07.785 --> 01:09.701
I don't think that's
an unreasonable request.

01:10.687 --> 01:13.038
Yeah, robin,
we will talk about this later.

01:13.074 --> 01:14.540
I've got to go. Bye.

01:15.793 --> 01:18.077
My husband
has an annoying habit

01:18.129 --> 01:20.412
of making important
life decisions without me.

01:20.464 --> 01:22.247
You're still struggling
to find child care?

01:22.299 --> 01:24.216
Not anymore apparently.

01:24.251 --> 01:26.251
Sounds like robin
found bailey a daycare

01:26.303 --> 01:27.536
and dropped her off
this morning

01:27.555 --> 01:28.720
with complete strangers.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.923
Oh, well, at least
she's not going out

01:30.975 --> 01:32.591
on stakeouts with him anymore.

01:32.643 --> 01:34.593
He was joking about getting
her a bullet proof vest

01:34.645 --> 01:36.228
and making her
his full-time partner.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.564
At this point, I wouldn't put
anything past that man.

01:38.599 --> 01:41.100
Well, here is your
updated calendar
for the rest of the day.

01:41.152 --> 01:42.434
And I've just been notified

01:42.486 --> 01:44.436
the jury for
the placencia murder trial
has reached a verdict.

01:44.488 --> 01:45.687
That was quick.

01:46.323 --> 01:47.356
Yeah.

01:53.730 --> 01:54.780
[man clears throat]

01:59.236 --> 02:00.786

planning to wait for counsel?

02:04.425 --> 02:08.627
[whispers] um,
sara and miss lopez
are stuck the elevator.

02:08.679 --> 02:11.630
Fire department
is already working on it.

02:11.682 --> 02:13.132
Yo, can we just
get this shit over with?

02:13.184 --> 02:14.916
Mr. Banks, language.

02:14.935 --> 02:16.969
Am I guilty or not?
Just read the verdict.

02:17.021 --> 02:18.437
-[door opens]
-we're here.

02:18.472 --> 02:19.555
Sorry, sorry.
[whispers] sorry.

02:21.025 --> 02:22.724
About time, miss lopez.

02:22.759 --> 02:24.810
Miss lopez, hello.

02:24.862 --> 02:25.944
Glad it all worked out.

02:25.980 --> 02:26.895
Our apologies, your honor.

02:28.816 --> 02:31.567
Back on the record,
people v. William banks.

02:31.602 --> 02:34.486
Now, that all parties
are present and accounted for,

02:34.538 --> 02:35.988
let's resume.

02:36.040 --> 02:37.022
Bailiff.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.112
Has the jury
reached a verdict?

02:44.131 --> 02:45.380
We have, your honor.

02:51.172 --> 02:52.588
Will the defendant
please stand?

02:55.809 --> 02:56.975
[woman coughs]

02:57.011 --> 02:59.595
the superior court
of the people of california,

-Yes, you can,
just take a deep breath.
-[sherri] ...Section 187...

03:06.854 --> 03:08.970
We, the jury,
in the above entitled action

03:08.989 --> 03:11.190
find the defendant guilty.

03:12.409 --> 03:13.859
[court murmuring]

03:16.664 --> 03:18.980
mr. Banks, you're looking
at life in prison,

03:18.999 --> 03:21.149
is something about that
amusing to you?

03:21.168 --> 03:22.251
Nah.

03:22.286 --> 03:24.653
I was just remembering
the look on stephanie's face

03:24.672 --> 03:26.004
when the life left her eyes.

03:27.208 --> 03:29.824
-That was pretty amusing.
-Mr. Banks, that is enough.

03:29.843 --> 03:31.376
-Bailiff.
-[gavel banging]

03:32.046 --> 03:33.495
hey, stop. Don't do this.

-Get off me!
-[grunts]

03:34.765 --> 03:36.298
-order! Bailiff!
-[indistinct shouting]

03:36.333 --> 03:38.016
-hey!
-I'm going to kill you!

03:38.052 --> 03:39.484
-I promise you that!
-[all murmuring]

03:39.520 --> 03:41.153
-I promise you!
-[woman] stop.

03:41.188 --> 03:42.688
-[lola] bailiff, order!
-[gavel banging]

03:42.723 --> 03:44.139
[sara gasping]

03:44.174 --> 03:46.225
-you okay, babe?
-I'm going to get
somebody, okay?

03:46.277 --> 03:48.310
[breath trembling]

03:48.345 --> 03:49.228
it's okay. It's okay.

03:49.280 --> 03:53.115
[hyperventilating]

03:57.288 --> 03:58.737
[upbeat music playing]

04:20.928 --> 04:22.261
we've got to find
some place new,

04:22.313 --> 04:23.345
this feels sleezy.

04:23.380 --> 04:25.180
This exciting,
it's a like a spy movie.

04:25.215 --> 04:27.933
You would make a terrible spy,
you talk too much.

04:27.985 --> 04:29.351
That's why I'm
a good prosecutor.

04:29.386 --> 04:30.385
True.

04:30.404 --> 04:33.438
God, today,
I felt like a referee.

04:33.490 --> 04:35.073
That was terrible.
What the hell was that?

04:35.109 --> 04:37.058
Can't say I wouldn't
have done the same thing.

04:37.077 --> 04:39.328
Well, let's hope
you never have to.

04:40.281 --> 04:41.780
Listen, um, you want
to come to the game

04:41.832 --> 04:42.881
with me and amy tonight?

04:42.916 --> 04:44.383
-I got an extra ticket.
-Clippers or lakers?

04:44.418 --> 04:46.401
-Neither, billionaires.
-The who now?

04:46.420 --> 04:48.287
La billionaires,
the new minor league team.

04:48.339 --> 04:49.288
Oh, yeah.

04:49.340 --> 04:51.456
The owner's a client
at amy's firm.

04:51.508 --> 04:52.958
-So we get a skybox.
-[lola] oh. Nice.

04:53.010 --> 04:54.209
-[mark] have you seen
the new arena?
-No.

04:54.244 --> 04:55.794
It is unbelievable.

04:55.846 --> 04:56.795
They got this buffet--

04:56.847 --> 04:58.764
I would live to come
and have a drink

04:58.799 --> 05:00.432
or three with you and amy

05:00.467 --> 05:04.219
but, uh, I got to relieve
robin of daddy daycare duty.

05:04.254 --> 05:06.588
Whatever, more wings
for me, sucker.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.440
-Bye.
-Bye.

05:14.765 --> 05:16.398
I was there
trying to out out the fire.

05:16.433 --> 05:17.733
Arson of a structure,

05:17.768 --> 05:19.151
they even threw in
an enhancement

05:19.203 --> 05:20.652
for damaging
multiple structures.

05:20.704 --> 05:21.820
I guess they were
feeling generous.

05:21.872 --> 05:23.322
Man, listen...

05:23.374 --> 05:25.774
Our encampment got raided
by the police again,

05:25.793 --> 05:26.958
so I grabbed
everything I could

05:26.994 --> 05:28.777
and I made my way to the 405.

05:28.796 --> 05:32.080
Before I got there I could see
the bonfires from blocks away,

05:32.115 --> 05:34.449
but it turns out
they weren't bonfires.

05:34.468 --> 05:36.501
The entire damn
encampment was on fire,

05:36.553 --> 05:38.170
so I ran over
and tried to help.

05:38.222 --> 05:39.971
The swab test confirmed
that you were covered

05:40.007 --> 05:42.090
in the same accelerant
that caused the blaze.

05:42.125 --> 05:43.008
That's not a good look.

05:43.060 --> 05:44.142
Do you have
an explanation for that?

05:44.178 --> 05:45.811
No, I don't know. I, I...

05:45.846 --> 05:47.262
Everything happened
so fast, I...

05:47.297 --> 05:49.181
Cyrus, you got
a good list of priors.

05:49.233 --> 05:50.816
But it's all low level,
non-violent.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.485
But the one that sticks out
is the strike for burglary.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.821
No, no,
I didn't steal anything.

05:55.856 --> 05:58.139
I caught a case
for taking back my property

05:58.158 --> 06:00.359
from a landlord
who stole it from me.

06:00.411 --> 06:01.827
They slapped me
with two years,

06:01.862 --> 06:04.145
but I volunteered
to help fight the wildfires.

06:04.164 --> 06:06.981
And it...
Well, I got out in one.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.750
So, this isn't your first time
around a fire?

06:09.753 --> 06:11.286
[music playing]

06:15.325 --> 06:16.308
[emily sighs]

06:19.263 --> 06:20.379
[sara sighs]

06:22.332 --> 06:23.298
hi.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.184
How you feeling?

06:26.220 --> 06:27.386
Hmm, like a million bucks.

06:28.839 --> 06:29.855
Are you hungry?

06:29.890 --> 06:30.889
Let me take
you out for a bite.

06:30.941 --> 06:32.724
Thanks for the offer

06:32.776 --> 06:34.359
but between the taste
of blood in my mouth

06:34.395 --> 06:36.645
and the crime scene photos
on my desk,

06:36.680 --> 06:37.979
I don't really
have much of an appetite.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.699
Just go on home.

06:41.869 --> 06:42.984
[sighs]

06:43.019 --> 06:44.369
I hate that
this happened to you.

06:44.405 --> 06:47.372
Yeah, well, if everyone were
always nice to each other,

06:47.408 --> 06:49.574
we wouldn't have jobs,
would we?

06:50.627 --> 06:51.660
[sighs]

06:51.695 --> 06:52.994
I'll call you tomorrow.

06:53.864 --> 06:55.547
-Okay.
-Hmm.

have you spoken
with my sister maddy?

07:09.897 --> 07:11.430
No, is something wrong?

[gloria]<i> I haven't heard</i>

That's not really like her.

07:15.652 --> 07:18.553
Okay, um, yeah,
tell me what you need.

07:18.572 --> 07:20.522

07:22.826 --> 07:23.892

07:30.000 --> 07:32.951
Do you have any idea
where she might be?

07:33.003 --> 07:35.420
She's probably
at the mini-mansion.

07:35.456 --> 07:38.573
-The mini-mansion?
-Yeah, brandon page's pad.

07:38.592 --> 07:41.543

Can't believe
that woman said no

08:17.948 --> 08:20.615
in front of 15,000 people
on the fancam.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.951
Proposals at sporting
events are awful.

08:22.970 --> 08:24.452
I mean,
who was the first idiot

08:24.471 --> 08:25.971
to think that was a good idea?

08:26.006 --> 08:27.589
I mean, women don't
want to be subjected

08:27.624 --> 08:29.123
to that kind of humiliation.

08:29.142 --> 08:30.458
Uh, to be fair, I don't think

08:30.477 --> 08:31.510
she was the one
who got humiliated.

08:31.562 --> 08:32.460
Exactly.

08:32.479 --> 08:33.845
Let that be a lesson.

08:33.897 --> 08:35.797
Maybe you guys
will stop doing it.

08:35.816 --> 08:37.131
Whoa, you guys?

-Yes.

papers on the fancam.

08:53.250 --> 08:55.200
Mark, don't do this.
Not tonight.

08:55.252 --> 08:56.334
Hey, trust me,
no one is more tired

08:56.370 --> 08:57.452
of this conversation than I am

08:57.487 --> 08:58.820
and I have tired
to be empathetic,

08:58.839 --> 09:01.623
but, like, he's taking
advantage of this situation.

09:01.658 --> 09:02.624
Will you just call an uber?

09:02.659 --> 09:05.010
[tires screeching]

09:06.680 --> 09:07.546
-[man 1] oh, my god.
-[woman] stop!

09:08.164 --> 09:09.931
[people screaming]

09:12.019 --> 09:13.435
[man 2] call 911!

09:14.688 --> 09:15.854
Hey, are you okay?

09:15.889 --> 09:17.556
-He came out of nowhere.
-Just, just lay still.

09:17.608 --> 09:18.690
-Hey, uh...
-Mark?

09:18.725 --> 09:20.559
I just witnessed an accident
and someone's been hit.

09:21.278 --> 09:22.561
-Mark?
-Yeah, yeah...

09:25.949 --> 09:27.232
Oh, shit.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.106
Good morning, your honor.

09:35.142 --> 09:36.875
-This is for you.
-[whispers] thank you.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.493
Dropping bailey off
at daycare,

09:38.512 --> 09:40.495
grabbing breakfast
and getting to the office

09:40.514 --> 09:42.514
only took 45 minutes,
can you believe that?

09:42.549 --> 09:44.499
Wow, so you're having
a change of heart

09:44.518 --> 09:46.134
about bailey's
daycare situation.

09:46.169 --> 09:47.852
I have to admit,
robin was on to something.

09:47.888 --> 09:49.804
The daycare is gorgeous.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.473
I even had to sign an nda

09:51.508 --> 09:53.391
because of all the celebrities
who drop their kids off there.

09:53.443 --> 09:54.693
[whispers] like who?

09:54.728 --> 09:56.194
What about
a non-disclosure agreement
don't you understand?

09:56.229 --> 09:58.063
-That's boring.
-[chuckles]

09:58.115 --> 10:00.315
they have vegan
catering options,

10:00.350 --> 10:01.866
he kids are drinking
artisanal fruit water.

10:01.902 --> 10:05.036
I grew up on juice boxes
and bologna sandwiches.

10:05.072 --> 10:07.372
I don't need bailey getting
used to this lap of luxury.

10:07.407 --> 10:08.490
We can't afford it long term.

10:08.525 --> 10:09.741
It's $300 a day.

10:09.793 --> 10:12.360
Well, then you
will be glad to know

10:12.379 --> 10:14.696
that I have put together
a short but diverse list

10:14.715 --> 10:15.880
of child care candidates

10:15.916 --> 10:17.999
for you and robin
to interview.

10:18.034 --> 10:20.702
Hmm, after the stenographers
you picked out,

10:20.721 --> 10:22.387
I'm not holding my breath.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.139
Um, ouch.

10:24.925 --> 10:27.058
-I can cancel.
-I'm kidding.

10:27.094 --> 10:28.843
I appreciate you. I need you.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.729
I don't know what I would do
without you.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.230
-That's more like it.
-Thank you.

10:32.265 --> 10:33.264
Yeah.

10:34.401 --> 10:35.850
-[knock at door]
-my apologies.

10:35.885 --> 10:37.385
-Rory fires.
-Luke watkins.

10:37.404 --> 10:40.522
And what do you have for me,
mr. Watkins?

10:40.557 --> 10:42.724
Straight to the point,
I can appreciate that.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.075
Outside of loitering,

10:44.111 --> 10:46.244
trespassing in
abandoned buildings
to keep warm at night,

10:46.279 --> 10:47.696
the only thing that my client

10:47.731 --> 10:49.581
is guilty of
is being homeless.

10:49.616 --> 10:51.583
He needs a warm meal
and a roof over his head.

10:51.618 --> 10:52.701
Not prison time.

10:52.736 --> 10:55.420
There is video footage
mr. Calleja at the scene.

10:55.455 --> 10:57.372
His fingerprints were
the only discernable ones

10:57.407 --> 11:00.458
found on the torch that was
used to start the fire.

11:00.510 --> 11:01.626
Does seem a bit dodgy.

11:01.678 --> 11:03.044
You can't prove malice.

11:03.079 --> 11:05.430
We're talking about
a few months in county
and some fines at worst.

11:05.465 --> 11:07.298
He used a torch,
I could very easily

11:07.351 --> 11:09.384
make a reasonable argument
for aggravated arson.

11:09.419 --> 11:10.385
And with his prior strike,

11:10.420 --> 11:12.103
he'd be looking
at 20 years to life.

11:12.139 --> 11:14.055
Instead the three year minimum
that I would've offered

11:14.090 --> 11:15.557
has doubled with the prior
strike enhancements

11:15.592 --> 11:16.591
and we find ourselves at six.

11:16.610 --> 11:17.642
I'll drop the rest
of the charges,

11:17.694 --> 11:18.727
and if he's a good boy,
he'll be out in,

11:18.762 --> 11:19.761
mmm, three or four?

11:19.780 --> 11:20.729
Come on, rory.

11:20.764 --> 11:21.980
He's a career criminal.

11:22.032 --> 11:24.766
Judge marshal could very well
impose a much stiffer sentence

11:24.785 --> 11:26.317
if this goes to trial
and you lose.

11:26.370 --> 11:28.319
And you will lose,
mr. Watkins.

11:28.372 --> 11:31.990
Another strike
would ruin his life.

11:32.042 --> 11:36.494
Split the difference,
non-strike, pc 452.

11:36.546 --> 11:38.797
Maybe he'll learn
to behave himself. Six years.

11:39.966 --> 11:41.466
All right, so,
I've got to ask.

11:41.501 --> 11:43.635
Did he attorneys
at wayne county

11:43.670 --> 11:45.453
really call you
the grim reaper

11:45.472 --> 11:47.255
because you never lost a case?

11:47.290 --> 11:49.791
The grim reaper moniker
maybe the byproduct

11:49.810 --> 11:51.426
of an overly vivid
imagination, I'm afraid.

11:51.461 --> 11:53.294
But it is true
that I've never lost.

11:53.313 --> 11:54.679
Well, there's plenty of time
to change that.

11:54.731 --> 11:57.265
When my client
beats these charges,

11:57.300 --> 11:58.850
I'll take you out for a beer.

11:58.902 --> 12:00.685
Pleasure meeting you,
mr. Watkins.

12:00.721 --> 12:02.437
I'll look forward
to that pint, cheerio.

12:05.141 --> 12:06.157
[exhales]

12:08.495 --> 12:09.861
how was the game last night?

12:09.913 --> 12:12.163
Ugh, it was... [chuckles]

12:12.199 --> 12:13.782
wait, how do you already
know about last night?

12:13.817 --> 12:16.451
Because I got a call
from the co-owner himself.

12:16.486 --> 12:17.335
For what?

12:17.370 --> 12:18.286
[andre] the guy
behind the wheel

12:18.321 --> 12:19.621
was the mascot for his team.

12:19.656 --> 12:22.123
It's only a matter of time
before a civil suit
comes their way.

12:22.158 --> 12:25.159
But before we worry
about that lawsuit,

12:25.178 --> 12:27.328
he wants us to act as counsel
for the same employee

12:27.347 --> 12:28.513
for the criminal case.

12:28.548 --> 12:29.714
Oh, if he wants us
to double bill him,

12:29.766 --> 12:31.332
I'm fine with that.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.334
Why doesn't he just fire
the kid to save face?

12:33.353 --> 12:34.936
Because that kid is his son.

12:36.106 --> 12:38.356
Of course it is. [scoffs]

12:38.391 --> 12:40.475
well, give it
to one of the juniors.

12:40.510 --> 12:43.528
Are you too good to work
a lowly dui case now?

12:44.564 --> 12:46.364
You know I can't be
anywhere near that case.

12:46.399 --> 12:47.899
I was a witness.

12:47.951 --> 12:49.901
But, I will gladly
represent myself

12:49.953 --> 12:51.185
on the assault charges coming

12:51.204 --> 12:52.904
if you don't get out
of my office.

12:53.540 --> 12:55.073
-All right.
-Buh-bye

12:55.125 --> 12:56.491
[both chuckle]

12:59.963 --> 13:01.529
-oh, mr. Callan.
-What's up, teddy?

13:01.548 --> 13:03.364
I received this file
from the ceu,

13:03.383 --> 13:04.532
there must be a mistake here.

13:04.551 --> 13:06.584
The felony dui case
has you listed as a witness.

13:06.636 --> 13:08.219
Yeah, that's not a mistake.

13:08.255 --> 13:10.171
Believe it or not, being a da
does not preclude me

13:10.206 --> 13:11.723
from witnessing some
of the wonderful things

13:11.758 --> 13:13.174
that happen outside
of this office.

13:13.209 --> 13:16.344
Right, but it should
exclude the da's office
from trying this case.

13:16.379 --> 13:17.428
We should recuse ourselves

13:17.481 --> 13:18.596
and have the attorney general
handle it.

13:18.648 --> 13:20.565
There's an obvious
conflict of interest here, no?

13:20.600 --> 13:22.100
That's small potatoes
to the ag, teddy.

13:22.152 --> 13:24.102
Uh, the size
of potatoes and ethics
are not mutually exclusive.

13:24.154 --> 13:26.554
Teddy, just shoot
this guy a decent deal,

13:26.573 --> 13:29.023
throw another one
up the win column
and move on to the next.

13:29.058 --> 13:31.025
Luckily, the pedestrian
was not seriously hurt.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.060
Part of being
a successful prosecutor,

13:33.079 --> 13:34.395
time management. Okay?

13:34.414 --> 13:36.247
Mr. Callan,
while I would never
second guess your judgment--

13:36.283 --> 13:37.365
uh, hold that thought.

13:39.503 --> 13:40.735
Hey.

13:40.754 --> 13:42.086
How are you holding up?

13:42.122 --> 13:43.204
[chuckles]
not sure what's worse,

13:43.239 --> 13:44.539
being trapped in an elevator

13:44.574 --> 13:45.757
hanging eight stories
off the ground

13:45.792 --> 13:48.293
or climbing up
ten flights in heels.

13:48.345 --> 13:50.211
That sounds like a lose-lose.

13:50.246 --> 13:52.931
Um, sara, listen, I,
I got to ask you something.

13:52.966 --> 13:54.799
I think I know
the answer, but,

13:54.851 --> 13:56.968
do you want to press charges
against pascal placencia?

13:57.020 --> 13:58.469
[sighs] no.

13:58.522 --> 14:00.138
That family's been
through enough.

14:00.190 --> 14:01.439
You sure?
We could have the case

14:01.474 --> 14:02.724
transferred to another
advocate--

14:02.759 --> 14:04.309
look, mark, I'm fine. Okay?

14:04.361 --> 14:06.394
-Anything else?
-Actually, yes.

14:06.429 --> 14:08.980
Um, miss placencia,
she's in a bit of a bind

14:09.032 --> 14:11.265
after paying for stephanie's
burial and funeral cost.

14:11.284 --> 14:12.567
Is there anyway
we can expedite

14:12.602 --> 14:14.285
filing that paperwork
to get her reimbursed?

14:14.321 --> 14:16.538
Yeah, I'll reach out
to miss placencia today.

14:17.157 --> 14:18.156
Okay.

14:20.493 --> 14:22.660
Also, they need assistance

14:22.712 --> 14:24.329
with crime scene
clean up services

14:24.381 --> 14:26.447
before they can move back
into their house.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.750
So, servpro is asking
for files of the damage.

14:28.785 --> 14:30.084
If you can just
send them those photos...

14:30.119 --> 14:31.502
Yeah, okay, I got it.

14:32.305 --> 14:33.638
...Can move forward.

14:36.726 --> 14:37.709
Uh...

14:38.511 --> 14:39.594
Yeah.

15:18.718 --> 15:19.767
[indistinct chatter]

15:39.572 --> 15:41.406
before we begin
today's hearing,

15:41.458 --> 15:43.574
I have to ask, mr. Calleja,

15:43.627 --> 15:46.878
would you happen be the son
of juan antonio calleja?

15:46.913 --> 15:48.913
Yes, I am, your honor.

15:48.965 --> 15:50.248
Um, why?

15:50.300 --> 15:53.217
Small world,
I played basketball with ac.

15:53.253 --> 15:55.053
We were thick as thieves
in high school.

15:55.088 --> 16:00.041
-How's he doing?
-Antonio passed away
last year.

16:00.060 --> 16:01.709
I'm very sorry to hear that.

16:01.728 --> 16:04.345
Now, while I haven't seen you
since you were a child,

16:04.380 --> 16:06.714
it's unfortunate
that this reunion

16:06.733 --> 16:08.933
isn't under
better circumstances.

16:08.985 --> 16:11.352
[clears throat] your honor,
I'd like to inform you

16:11.387 --> 16:14.072
that the people have withdrawn
the original offer

16:14.107 --> 16:16.441
and are looking to add
supplementary charges.

16:16.493 --> 16:18.609
Objection. On what grounds?

16:18.662 --> 16:20.111
Overruled.

16:22.282 --> 16:23.614
What, what does that mean?

16:23.667 --> 16:25.533
That things just got a whole
lot more complicated.

16:25.568 --> 16:28.619
We've received
substantial evidence
connecting mr. Calleja

16:28.672 --> 16:31.289
to half-a-dozen more fires
over the last two years.

16:31.341 --> 16:32.623
And since
I'm new to this office,

16:32.676 --> 16:34.292
I wasn't made privy
to these cold cases.

16:34.344 --> 16:36.427
Or hot cases,
if you pardon the pun.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.963
You honor, we'd like a chance
to review the new discovery.

16:39.015 --> 16:41.966
Outside of a few fingerprints
and people claiming they saw

16:42.018 --> 16:44.052
a homeless man
at homeless encampments,

16:44.087 --> 16:45.136
do you have any real evidence?

16:45.171 --> 16:47.939
We have eye witness
testimony of mr. Calleja

16:47.974 --> 16:49.774
frequenting all
of the targeted encampments.

16:49.809 --> 16:51.776
His fingerprints
and his fingerprints alone

16:51.811 --> 16:53.811
were found on torch
which was used

16:53.863 --> 16:55.813
to start the blaze
under the 405.

16:55.865 --> 16:57.398
The evidence is irrefutable.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.150
There is no way that
he could've done all of this,

16:59.185 --> 17:00.234
he was incarcerated.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.953
Well, not a single one
of these fires occurred

17:01.988 --> 17:03.988
while mr. Calleja
was behind bars.

17:04.040 --> 17:06.107
Prosecution's motion
is granted.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.625
-But, your honor--
-thank you, your honor.

17:07.660 --> 17:10.995
The amended charges are
two counts of malicious arson,

17:11.047 --> 17:12.246
'causing grave bodily injury

17:12.281 --> 17:16.117
and two counts for the arson
of an inhabited structure.

17:16.136 --> 17:18.452
The people will be seeking
the maximum for each.

17:18.471 --> 17:21.089
Why are you railroading
my client?

17:21.124 --> 17:22.456
I wasn't finished,
mr. Watkins.

17:22.475 --> 17:25.259
Prior strike enhancements
sees these penalties doubled.

17:25.294 --> 17:27.812
For a total of 37 years
and eight months.

17:27.847 --> 17:29.313
No, no, this is bullshit.

17:29.349 --> 17:30.481
-I didn't do this.
-[luke] hey, hey, stop.

17:30.517 --> 17:31.983
I swear on everything
that I didn't do this.

17:32.018 --> 17:34.652
Watch your language,
mr. Calleja,

17:34.687 --> 17:37.355
or I will hold you
in contempt of court.

17:37.407 --> 17:38.856
Is that understood?

17:39.976 --> 17:41.192
Yes, you honor.

17:45.148 --> 17:46.998
It's my understanding
that both parties

17:47.033 --> 17:48.482
have reached a plea agreement.

17:48.501 --> 17:49.784
Uh, yes, your honor.

17:49.819 --> 17:51.619
Since this is
mr. Dunham's first offence

17:51.654 --> 17:53.337
with relatively
minor injuries,

17:53.373 --> 17:56.340
the people are charging this
as a non-strike felony dui

17:56.376 --> 17:57.675
with minimum penalties.

17:57.710 --> 18:00.294
It does look like
mr. Dunham might've been

18:00.329 --> 18:01.846
on the receiving end
of the worst of it.

18:01.881 --> 18:03.497
I won't ask you to stand.

18:03.516 --> 18:07.051
Mr. Dunham, do you understand
that by pleading no contest

18:07.103 --> 18:09.554
you are giving up
your rights to a trial

18:09.606 --> 18:11.522
and all rights
associated with a trial?

18:11.558 --> 18:12.640
Yes, your honor.

18:14.227 --> 18:16.844
The defendant has agreed
to accept three years

18:16.863 --> 18:18.012
of summary probation,

18:18.031 --> 18:20.198
penalties totaling $5,000,

18:20.233 --> 18:23.184
a three month court approved
alcohol education program,

18:23.203 --> 18:24.819
and restitution
to the injured party.

18:24.854 --> 18:25.853
-[door opens]
-is that correct?

18:25.872 --> 18:27.538
[andre] excuse
the interruption, your honor.

18:29.109 --> 18:30.708
But I think
we can come up with

18:30.743 --> 18:33.044
more favorable terms
for mr. Dunham.

18:46.059 --> 18:48.009
[andre] it's good
to see you again,
judge carmichael.

18:48.044 --> 18:51.429
Mr. Armstrong, I didn't see
your name on my calendar.

18:51.464 --> 18:52.680
I was under the impression

18:52.715 --> 18:54.381
you were on a plane
back to dc.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.050
If you'd returned my text,

18:56.069 --> 18:58.236
you would've known
that audubon, quinn
& associates

18:58.271 --> 19:00.438
decided to make
a last minute substitution.

19:00.490 --> 19:01.739
As one of the new faces
of the firm,

19:01.774 --> 19:04.375
we thought it best if I
personally oversee this case

19:04.410 --> 19:06.227
for our new
high profile client,

19:06.246 --> 19:08.062
the los angeles billionaires.

19:08.081 --> 19:10.281
If mr. Biswas agrees
to knock this down

19:10.333 --> 19:12.950
to a misdemeanor,
with the required minimums,

19:13.002 --> 19:14.919
we can just end
this thing right now.

19:14.954 --> 19:16.954
And I'll still have time
to make my flight.

19:17.006 --> 19:17.905
Absolutely not.

19:17.924 --> 19:19.690
I offered mr. Dunham
a reasonable deal.

19:19.726 --> 19:21.726
One significantly less
than he would've received

19:21.761 --> 19:23.261
for putting someone
in the hospital.

19:24.264 --> 19:26.247
[sighs] there you have it.

19:26.266 --> 19:27.732
I'll cancel my travel plans

19:27.767 --> 19:29.717
and I'll look forward
to working with both of you.

19:34.107 --> 19:36.240
Uh, judge carmhael,

19:36.276 --> 19:38.809
do you know mr. Armstrong,
like, personally?

19:38.845 --> 19:40.745
Is there something
you're trying to imply?

19:40.780 --> 19:42.930
Uh, no, ma'am,
I just, I just, because--

19:42.949 --> 19:44.949
have a good day, mr. Biswas.

19:44.984 --> 19:46.234
[door opens]

19:47.954 --> 19:48.986
[door closes]

19:50.773 --> 19:53.941
[rory] captain monroe,
were you able to determine
the cause of the fire?

19:53.960 --> 19:57.128
Yes, the blaze
was intentionally set
with a drip torch.

19:57.163 --> 20:00.097
Photos of said device,
your honor,

20:00.133 --> 20:01.465
found at the crime scene

20:01.501 --> 20:05.503
and pre-marked
as 'prosecution exhibit a.'

20:05.555 --> 20:08.923
captain, why is the use
of a drip torch significant?

20:08.958 --> 20:10.624
Have you heard
of the expression,
"fight fire with fire?"

20:10.643 --> 20:11.609
I have.

20:11.644 --> 20:13.344
Drip torches are used
for controlled burns.

20:13.396 --> 20:15.813
Used improperly, they can be
incredibly destructive.

20:15.848 --> 20:18.649
So, these fires
are the work of an arsonist?

20:18.685 --> 20:21.602
-Objection, leading.
-Sustained.

20:21.637 --> 20:23.437
How would you
categorize these fires?

20:23.472 --> 20:24.972
As the work of an arsonist.

20:24.991 --> 20:27.325
And who is it
that typically employs

20:27.360 --> 20:28.826
the use of a drip torch?

20:28.861 --> 20:32.313
They're commonly used
by cal fire crews
during the wildfire season.

20:32.332 --> 20:37.585
Was mr. Calleja employed
as a member of the cal fire
inmate program?

20:38.037 --> 20:39.003
That is correct.

20:40.156 --> 20:41.088
No further questions.

20:44.677 --> 20:45.960

20:46.012 --> 20:47.461

who are you?

Is this brandon page's place?

21:07.367 --> 21:09.033
If you want an autograph
or a selfie,

21:09.068 --> 21:11.018
he posts all of his dates
for his events online.

21:11.037 --> 21:13.020
But you can't be here,
you gotta kick rocks.

21:13.039 --> 21:14.872
Is there a maddy hernandez
staying here?

21:14.907 --> 21:16.540
Look, lady, I said beat feet.

21:16.576 --> 21:17.992
-Get out of here.
-Hey, leo.

21:18.027 --> 21:21.862
Come on, there's no need
to talk to our guest
like that.

21:21.881 --> 21:24.665
Look, I'm not gonna say
if she is or isn't.

21:25.534 --> 21:26.533
What do you want with her?

21:26.552 --> 21:28.219
You are aware
that maddy hernandez

21:28.254 --> 21:30.087
is a sophomore
in high school, right?

21:31.758 --> 21:34.392
Well, that's definitely
news to me.

21:34.427 --> 21:38.379
But I can assure you the only
funny business going on
in the mini mansion

21:38.398 --> 21:40.398
is legendary tik-bait videos.

21:40.433 --> 21:41.399
Ms. Lopez?

21:42.718 --> 21:43.901
What are you doing here?

21:43.936 --> 21:46.570
Honey, your sister wanted me
to make sure that you're safe.

21:46.606 --> 21:48.522
-Are you okay?
-My sister?

21:48.557 --> 21:49.940
Tell her
I'm living my best life.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.526
You can leave now. Bye.

21:52.561 --> 21:54.328
Do your foster parents
know you're here?

21:56.282 --> 21:58.232
Okay, I think you should
probably come with me.

21:58.251 --> 21:59.733
-I think I'll stay.
-Nah.

21:59.752 --> 22:01.702
You gotta bounce.

22:01.737 --> 22:02.953
What? Why?

22:03.006 --> 22:05.072
Look, leo will mail you
some merch.

22:05.091 --> 22:06.090
Good luck.

22:06.843 --> 22:08.042
You heard, let's go.

22:11.347 --> 22:12.430
Thanks a lot.

22:32.452 --> 22:34.735
-Jesus, teddy!
-Oh.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.487
-God!
-What are you doing
here so late?

22:38.458 --> 22:39.990
-Are you quitting?
-[sara sighs]

22:40.993 --> 22:42.410
look, I don't know.

22:43.162 --> 22:44.662
I do this when I'm stressed.

22:44.714 --> 22:46.780
Just, typing it out
makes it real, and...

22:46.799 --> 22:48.466
When I can't bring myself
to send it,

22:48.501 --> 22:50.801
it forces me to realize
I'm doing something impulsive.

22:50.837 --> 22:51.969
That make sense?

22:52.004 --> 22:53.087
No, not really.

22:55.725 --> 22:58.959
Hopefully the conviction
brought them some closure.

22:58.978 --> 23:01.929
Ever look across the courtroom
and think about
the terrible things

23:01.964 --> 23:03.464
some of these people
have done?

23:03.483 --> 23:05.099
That's the da's job.

23:05.134 --> 23:07.151
Back when I was
a court reporter,

23:07.186 --> 23:09.687
I recorded
the violence, but...

23:09.739 --> 23:11.972
I don't know, I was always
able to leave it on the page.

23:11.991 --> 23:14.942
Now I'm side-by-side
with these victims
and their families.

23:14.977 --> 23:16.643
Day and night.

23:16.662 --> 23:18.112
Shouldering their pain, and...

23:20.149 --> 23:21.999
I'm wearing it.

23:22.034 --> 23:25.703
You show up just chipper
and ready to go,
every single day.

23:26.506 --> 23:27.671
How do you do it?

23:27.707 --> 23:30.791
I just started. So I haven't
been punched in a courtroom.

23:30.826 --> 23:31.876
Hard for me to say.

23:32.929 --> 23:34.879
-Mrs. Castillo...
-Teddy...

23:34.931 --> 23:37.664
I have told you before,
you can call me sara.

23:37.683 --> 23:40.384
Sara, I'm not
the most social guy,

23:40.436 --> 23:42.520
and I'm not
really great with...

23:42.555 --> 23:44.889
Personal connections
or making friends.

23:44.941 --> 23:47.358
Outside of
my overbearing parents,

23:47.393 --> 23:50.194
this job, the people
I work with and for,

23:51.197 --> 23:52.062
it's all I really have.

23:53.065 --> 23:54.648
That's why
I show up every day.

24:00.790 --> 24:02.689
-Here you go chief mill.
-Thank you.

24:02.708 --> 24:04.024
-Mmm-hmm.
-Hey.

24:04.043 --> 24:06.544
But if a building's
not on fire,
you can call me sam.

24:06.579 --> 24:08.295
Okay. [clears throat]

24:09.865 --> 24:11.382
you know,
for a lot of these young men,

24:11.417 --> 24:13.867
volunteer programming
is just another way
to shorten a sentence,

24:13.886 --> 24:15.503
but for cyrus
it was different.

24:16.305 --> 24:18.589
He loved being a firefighter.

24:18.641 --> 24:20.224
He was damn good at it, too.

24:20.259 --> 24:23.260
So I'm having
a hard time believing
he was behind all this.

24:23.312 --> 24:24.261
What makes you say that?

24:24.313 --> 24:25.729
The young man was on my crew

24:25.765 --> 24:29.066
during one of the worst
fire seasons in decades.

24:29.101 --> 24:30.401
I saw the look in his eyes.

24:30.436 --> 24:35.439
I saw tears in his eyes
every time we couldn't
save a house.

24:35.491 --> 24:37.408
Told me something
I'll never forget.

24:37.443 --> 24:40.027
He said "I don't have a place
to call home.

24:40.062 --> 24:42.863
And I don't want
anybody else to know
what that feels like."

24:42.898 --> 24:45.082
damn. Talk about perspective.

24:45.117 --> 24:46.367
I'm trying to figure out

24:46.402 --> 24:48.919
how cyrus would have had
access to these drip torches.

24:48.955 --> 24:51.738
Inmates weren't allowed
to handle torches.

24:51.757 --> 24:52.756
For obvious reasons.

24:52.792 --> 24:54.091
They were under
heavy supervision,

24:54.126 --> 24:55.876
so there was no way
he could have stolen one.

24:55.911 --> 24:58.262
Okay, the investigator
who testified today

24:58.297 --> 25:01.265
placed cyrus
near all these fires.

25:02.935 --> 25:04.268
That's what
I'm struggling with.

25:04.303 --> 25:06.604
Now, you mentioned
that you were on
the arson team, right?

25:06.639 --> 25:08.422
That's right, worked
my ass off to be

25:08.441 --> 25:11.592
one of the 22 investigators
in la county.

25:11.611 --> 25:14.261
Only 22? That doesn't
seem like many.

25:14.280 --> 25:15.429
It's not.

25:15.448 --> 25:17.565
There are 3,500
firefighters in la,

25:17.600 --> 25:19.567
so to be one of the 22
meant you were the best.

25:19.602 --> 25:22.953
Okay, but what are
the chances of
the same investigator

25:22.989 --> 25:25.739
being at each and every one
of these calls?

25:27.776 --> 25:28.876
Well that's, um...

25:34.867 --> 25:36.667
<i> Wow...</i>

25:36.702 --> 25:39.720
See? Sometimes,
calling in sick
to go grab brunch

25:39.739 --> 25:41.888
is the best form of self-care.

25:41.908 --> 25:43.724
Yeah, about that.

25:43.743 --> 25:47.411
I didn't actually
call in sick.

25:47.446 --> 25:48.913
I no-called no-showed.

25:50.249 --> 25:51.916
-Sara?
-What?

25:51.951 --> 25:55.085
Look, I, I blew through
my sick days a long time ago.

25:55.121 --> 25:59.256
I just need a break
from the ultra-violence
I ingest every day.

26:00.075 --> 26:01.091
It's not healthy.

26:01.127 --> 26:03.377
I don't want to quit,
but sometimes

26:03.412 --> 26:05.596
I don't know
how to leave work at work.

26:07.133 --> 26:08.265
Okay.

26:08.301 --> 26:11.885
So, have you thought about
talking to a therapist?

26:11.920 --> 26:12.970
-Ugh.
-Listen.

26:13.022 --> 26:15.255
This is something you tell
people to do every day.

26:15.274 --> 26:17.090
You told me to do it.
I listened to you.

26:17.109 --> 26:18.925
And it probably saved my life.

26:18.945 --> 26:20.260
I can't afford it.

26:20.279 --> 26:22.396
Look, I filed
for workman's comp,

26:22.431 --> 26:24.064
but who knows
how long that'll take,

26:24.099 --> 26:27.067
and calvcb
only reimburses victims.

26:27.102 --> 26:29.954
So I don't qualify
unless I press charges
against pascal.

26:30.623 --> 26:32.790
You can see my predicament.

26:32.825 --> 26:34.575
Why aren't you at the office?

26:34.610 --> 26:36.994
I am still on office orphan.

26:37.046 --> 26:40.914
I spent my entire day
yesterday chasing
a teenager

26:40.949 --> 26:43.917
around la county
like carmen sandiego.

26:43.952 --> 26:46.420
Her sister was really worried
about her, so...

26:46.455 --> 26:49.289
I tracked her down
at brandon page's house.

26:49.308 --> 26:52.476
Wait, that guy who was
always on tmz
for pulling pranks on people?

26:52.511 --> 26:53.727
That's the one.

26:53.763 --> 26:56.597
Should I even ask why he's got
a teenage girl at his house?

26:57.299 --> 26:58.315
Sounds sketchy.

26:59.652 --> 27:01.185
Yeah.

27:01.237 --> 27:04.154
Cyrus, why were your prints
all over that torch?

27:04.190 --> 27:06.440
I need you
to be honest with me.

27:06.475 --> 27:08.475
On god, I've never used
one of those things
in my entire life.

27:08.494 --> 27:09.910
Look, when I got there,

27:09.945 --> 27:12.529
the smoke was so thick
I couldn't see two feet
in front of my face.

27:12.581 --> 27:14.147
I had my shirt covering
my mouth,

27:14.166 --> 27:15.949
I was crawling around
on my hands and knees,

27:15.984 --> 27:17.201
making sure everybody
was out safe.

27:17.253 --> 27:18.652
I grabbed a fire extinguisher,

27:18.671 --> 27:19.820
but the thing
was out of juice.

27:19.839 --> 27:21.955
I did everything I could,
there wasn't much I could do,

27:21.990 --> 27:23.123
so I took off.

27:23.158 --> 27:26.210
Cyrus, there was
no extinguisher,
they only found a torch.

27:29.265 --> 27:32.016
But wait, is it possible
that you grabbed the torch

27:32.051 --> 27:33.801
thinking that
it was the extinguisher?

27:35.187 --> 27:36.854
Um, look at this.

27:38.391 --> 27:40.557
They're nearly identical
in those conditions,

27:40.609 --> 27:41.775
there's no way
you would have known.

27:44.179 --> 27:45.896
You were trying
to do the right thing.

27:46.899 --> 27:48.032
And that explains the prints.

27:58.044 --> 27:59.209
Teddy, have you seen sara?

27:59.245 --> 28:00.411
Um, not today.

28:00.463 --> 28:01.879
She's not responding
to me e-mails,

28:01.914 --> 28:04.030
she's not answering my calls,
it's just... Weird.

28:04.050 --> 28:06.700
-It's not like her.
-Uh, mr. Callan.

28:06.719 --> 28:08.368
-Can I ask you a question?
-Shoot.

28:08.387 --> 28:11.004
Uh, judge carmichael
and mr. Armstrong.

28:11.039 --> 28:13.424
Is there something
going on there
that I should know about?

28:39.568 --> 28:41.785
Chambers. Now.

28:48.427 --> 28:50.127
Mr. Armstrong,
what do you think
you're doing?

28:50.179 --> 28:52.546
Providing
the best possible defense
for my client.

28:52.581 --> 28:55.582
No, you are trying
to turn my courtroom
into a theatre.

28:55.601 --> 28:57.801
Keep it up,
and I will hold you
in contempt.

28:57.853 --> 28:58.919
That's not necessary.

28:58.938 --> 29:00.471
Your honor.

29:00.523 --> 29:03.924
I've been made aware
of a previous relationship

29:03.943 --> 29:05.142
between you and mr. Armstrong

29:05.194 --> 29:06.944
which is obviously
a conflict of interest...

29:06.979 --> 29:09.763
I don't know where
you're getting
your information from,

29:09.782 --> 29:12.816
mr. Biswas,
but I can assure you,
there is no conflict.

29:12.868 --> 29:16.269
Now is there anything else
before I kick you both
out of my chambers?

29:16.288 --> 29:17.404
No, your honor.

29:25.664 --> 29:27.798
Courtesy copies of the records
your subpoenaed.

29:27.833 --> 29:29.967
The first is work schedules
and mdts,

29:30.002 --> 29:32.669
the second, cell phone records
and 911 transcripts.

29:32.721 --> 29:34.287
Thanks, carol.

29:34.306 --> 29:36.507
I don't mean to pry,
but is there a reason

29:36.559 --> 29:38.008
that you're investigating
the investigator?

29:38.060 --> 29:40.177
Something just seems off.

29:40.229 --> 29:42.763
I mean, the right investigator
just happened to be
at the right place

29:42.798 --> 29:44.598
at the right time every time?

29:44.633 --> 29:46.483
It's a very
dangerous accusation.

29:46.519 --> 29:47.484
Believe me, I'm not trying

29:47.520 --> 29:49.153
to take on the entire
fire department,

29:49.188 --> 29:52.156
but my client is facing
decades in prison
for a crime

29:53.308 --> 29:55.025
that I don't think
he committed.

29:55.077 --> 29:57.444
Well, you've never
backed away before.

29:57.479 --> 29:58.695
Why start now?

30:07.139 --> 30:09.372
Thank you for taking time
out of your busy schedule

30:09.391 --> 30:11.091
to answer a few
more questions for us.

30:11.143 --> 30:12.392
It's no problem at all.

30:12.428 --> 30:14.428
The subpoena didn't give me
much of a choice, though.

30:14.480 --> 30:15.762
[chuckles]

30:15.814 --> 30:18.232
captain monroe,
what is your experience
with a drip torch?

30:18.267 --> 30:20.434
I have a decade of experience
as a firefighter,

30:20.486 --> 30:23.053
and going into my sixth year
as an investigator.

30:23.072 --> 30:24.738
And you were at
each of the crime scenes,
correct?

30:24.773 --> 30:26.156
Yes, that is correct.

30:26.192 --> 30:29.576
And you, personally,
reviewed and collected
all the evidence, right?

30:29.612 --> 30:31.028
That is also correct.

30:31.063 --> 30:34.231
Had you visited
any of these locations
prior to your investigation?

30:34.250 --> 30:36.617
-No, why would I have?
-Interesting.

30:36.669 --> 30:39.953
I'd like to submit
your phone records,
work schedule,

30:40.005 --> 30:43.006
and 911 calls into evidence.

30:45.344 --> 30:48.078
These phone records show
that you were present

30:48.097 --> 30:51.298
at each of the fires
that mr. Calleja
is accused of.

30:51.350 --> 30:52.883
Of course,
as a lead investigator.

30:52.918 --> 30:56.720
The cell towers indicate
that your personal cell phone

30:56.755 --> 30:58.588
was at each of these locations

30:58.607 --> 31:02.693
hours before
any 911 calls were made.

31:05.915 --> 31:08.315
Are you familiar
with the fbi profile

31:08.367 --> 31:10.150
on firebugs, captain monroe?

31:10.202 --> 31:12.903
Arsonists that moonlight
as firefighters?

31:12.938 --> 31:14.437
Objection. Argumentative.

31:14.456 --> 31:15.572
Overruled.

31:15.607 --> 31:18.325
That's fine.
The defense rests.

31:20.129 --> 31:21.912
Counsel, please approach
the bench.

31:23.165 --> 31:25.282
I move to have
the charges dismissed

31:25.301 --> 31:26.800
at the conclusion
of this hearing.

31:26.835 --> 31:30.637
Not only is
the prosecution's lead witness
lying under oath,

31:30.673 --> 31:32.005
he's probably the perp.

31:32.057 --> 31:34.925
Mr. Watkins
is a fantastic storyteller,
I will give him that,

31:34.960 --> 31:37.811
but there is more than enough
evidence to go to trial here,
your honor.

31:37.846 --> 31:39.296
The evidence
brought to light here

31:39.315 --> 31:41.515
certainly raises
some questions.

31:41.567 --> 31:44.768
And I will take all of this
into consideration.

31:44.803 --> 31:46.353
Let's take a brief recess.

31:49.908 --> 31:52.659
-Did you see
the moment of impact?
-Yes.

31:52.695 --> 31:54.778
Did you remove
the driver's mask?

31:54.813 --> 31:57.497
I didn't want to risk
exacerbating any injuries.

31:57.533 --> 31:59.666
So you didn't see
the driver's face?

31:59.702 --> 32:00.867
No, I did not.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.502
Had you been drinking
that night?

32:02.538 --> 32:03.670
Objection. Relevance.

32:03.706 --> 32:04.921
Overruled.

32:05.591 --> 32:06.823
I had a few drinks.

32:06.842 --> 32:08.325
So you were impaired as well.

32:08.344 --> 32:09.659
Legally, yes.

32:09.678 --> 32:11.295
But that's why
I ordered an uber.

32:11.330 --> 32:13.347
I was being responsible.
Unlike the defendant.

32:13.382 --> 32:14.998
Mr. Callan, that's enough.

32:15.017 --> 32:17.050
Counsel, approach the bench.

32:24.526 --> 32:26.509
This trial has been tip-toeing

32:26.528 --> 32:29.196
the precipice
of unprofessionalism,

32:29.231 --> 32:31.481
and quite frankly,
I am done here.

32:31.516 --> 32:32.866
Now, mr. Armstrong.

32:32.901 --> 32:35.018
Your client was offered
a fair deal that he was
ready to accept

32:35.037 --> 32:36.153
before you crashed the party.

32:36.188 --> 32:38.488
Now I suggest that
you reconsider that deal

32:38.523 --> 32:40.540
or we can send this
to the attorney general.

32:40.576 --> 32:41.875
If the defendant accepts,

32:41.910 --> 32:43.543
the people are willing
to honor that offer.

32:43.579 --> 32:45.829
Mr. Dunham is
an upstanding member
of the community

32:45.864 --> 32:48.531
who has never been in trouble
with the law in any capacity.

32:48.550 --> 32:50.700
He was caught up in the moment
and made a poor decision.

32:50.719 --> 32:52.386
He was driving
under the influence.

32:52.421 --> 32:54.037
My client was taking
prescribed meds.

32:54.056 --> 32:55.005
He injured a pedestrian.

32:55.040 --> 32:57.007
Mr. Dunham realizes
he made a mistake.

32:57.042 --> 32:59.876
But that is no reason
to throw the book at him.

32:59.895 --> 33:03.263
Sometimes true justice
includes the punishments
that aren't given.

33:10.222 --> 33:12.239
In the interest of time
and taxpayer dollars,

33:12.274 --> 33:15.025
the people are willing
to charge this a misdemeanor

33:15.060 --> 33:17.077
with the minimum
penalties assessed.

33:21.166 --> 33:22.582
I appreciate
your understanding.

33:24.086 --> 33:26.203
Counsellors.
You may step back.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.378
Mr. Dunham.

33:34.413 --> 33:37.130
Consider yourself
extremely lucky.

33:37.182 --> 33:38.215
Not only because
the punishment

33:38.250 --> 33:41.551
could have been
much more severe,

33:41.586 --> 33:43.637
but also because
you are alive,

33:43.689 --> 33:45.722
and standing
in this courtroom today.

33:50.362 --> 33:53.280
This new evidence
has cast significant doubt

33:53.315 --> 33:55.282
on the prosecution's case.

33:55.317 --> 33:58.652
As such, I have decided
to dismiss all charges

33:58.704 --> 34:00.487
due to insufficient evidence.

34:00.539 --> 34:03.073
Mr. Calleja,
you are free to go.

34:14.553 --> 34:15.635
You're just gonna
let him walk?

34:15.671 --> 34:16.837
No, not quite.

34:16.889 --> 34:18.839
I'd love to have a look
through the notes
you compiled

34:18.891 --> 34:20.957
on captain monroe
so we can start
putting a case together.

34:20.976 --> 34:23.977
I'm going to see to it
that man spends
a long time in prison.

34:24.012 --> 34:25.429
Of course,
there is one other thing.

34:25.464 --> 34:27.898
-What's that?
-About that pint.

34:28.984 --> 34:29.983
Well played, sir.

34:35.140 --> 34:36.323
Hey. Come on in.

34:37.075 --> 34:38.074
Shut the door behind you.

34:44.249 --> 34:46.199
Okay, um...

34:46.251 --> 34:49.619
I'm sorry about going awol
the last couple days.

34:49.654 --> 34:51.338
I think I was having
an existential meltdown,

34:51.373 --> 34:54.291
but that's just still
no excuse for my behavior.

34:54.326 --> 34:55.258
Have a seat.

34:59.097 --> 35:00.180
Sara...

35:00.215 --> 35:02.215
Whatever you're going through,

35:02.267 --> 35:03.800
I hope you know
you can always talk to me.

35:04.836 --> 35:07.604
What happened to you
the other day was awful.

35:09.358 --> 35:14.027
This job can be terrifying.

35:15.113 --> 35:17.564
And it can heartbreaking.

35:18.200 --> 35:19.699
It can be a lot of things.

35:19.735 --> 35:23.236
But whatever it is,
you cannot disappear.

35:23.288 --> 35:24.738
You got too many people
counting on you.

35:24.790 --> 35:26.122
Too many people who need you.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.508
You know, I've been...

35:28.544 --> 35:32.162
Questioning if I have
the strength to be here.

35:33.298 --> 35:35.749
-But, but I know
I want to be here.
-Good.

35:37.035 --> 35:39.219
Because you are
the strongest person I know.

35:41.723 --> 35:42.956
-Thank you.
-Hey.

35:44.977 --> 35:46.059
You've got this.

35:55.404 --> 35:58.071
You can't be upset with me.
I'm alone in here.

35:58.106 --> 35:59.389
You're alone in here?

35:59.408 --> 36:00.407
I'm alone out there.

36:00.442 --> 36:02.025
Brandon doesn't care
about you, either.

36:02.060 --> 36:04.327
He only cares about
the money and attention
that comes along with it.

36:04.913 --> 36:05.912
It's not even like that.

36:05.948 --> 36:07.614
These people are
not your friends, maddy.

36:07.666 --> 36:09.783
-They're dangerous.
-You're being dramatic.

36:09.835 --> 36:11.918
You promised me that you would
stay away from them.

36:11.954 --> 36:14.454
-You're just jealous.
-Maddy. Come...

36:17.009 --> 36:18.091
Maddy.

36:18.794 --> 36:19.793
There he is.

36:21.129 --> 36:22.963
-There he is.
-[milton chuckles]

36:27.352 --> 36:28.718
what are you doing here?

36:28.753 --> 36:30.086
I'm here because of this guy.

36:30.105 --> 36:32.022
I knew you couldn't
have been involved.

36:34.026 --> 36:35.609
I can't thank you enough, man.

36:35.644 --> 36:38.144
I'm thinking you should
consider getting yourself
an attorney

36:38.196 --> 36:41.898
to file a lawsuit
against the city
for false arrest.

36:41.933 --> 36:44.317
Wouldn't mind a couple bucks
to get a roof over my head.

36:44.369 --> 36:46.236
Well, if you're looking
for a gig to help
make ends meet

36:46.271 --> 36:47.654
you might be in luck.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.606
The county's looking
to start a pilot program.

36:49.625 --> 36:51.291
-What's that?
-Moving forward,

36:51.326 --> 36:53.610
inmates who serve
as volunteer firefighters

36:53.629 --> 36:56.963
are eligible
to attend academy
after their release.

36:56.999 --> 36:58.298
-For real?
-Yeah.

36:59.835 --> 37:00.967
Man, where do I sign up?

37:01.003 --> 37:02.452
-Aw, ha-ha!
-Hey!

37:02.471 --> 37:03.753
Down at the firehouse!

37:03.788 --> 37:06.256
Come on,
there's a nice warm cot
waiting for you, too.

37:06.291 --> 37:07.924
I'll give you a ride.

37:11.463 --> 37:13.980
-Thank you, man.
-Good luck.

37:15.484 --> 37:17.267
Yes. Yes!

37:26.862 --> 37:29.529
I'm proud of luke.
He did fantastic today.

37:29.581 --> 37:31.615
Kept an innocent man
out of jail.

37:31.650 --> 37:33.833
Your partner,
on the other hand, oof.

37:33.869 --> 37:34.951
What about him?

37:34.986 --> 37:36.836
He turned lola's courtroom
into a sideshow.

37:36.872 --> 37:38.038
What?

37:38.090 --> 37:40.373
One of our juniors
was supposed to oversee
that case.

37:40.425 --> 37:42.342
-He didn't tell you?
-Uh, no!

37:42.377 --> 37:44.294
He knows I would have
shut that down.

37:44.329 --> 37:46.663
Well, your boy
was pulling out all the stops.

37:46.682 --> 37:47.830
Ugh.

37:47.849 --> 37:49.633
Well, he and I
will have a little chat.

37:50.185 --> 37:52.135
Speaking of chat.

37:52.170 --> 37:55.555
There was something I wanted
to talk to you about.

37:55.607 --> 37:59.059
I was thinking about
our conversation
from the other night.

37:59.111 --> 38:00.343
And?

38:00.362 --> 38:02.395
I don't want you to think
our life together

38:02.447 --> 38:05.699
is not my top priority,
because it is.

38:05.734 --> 38:09.319
I really appreciate
all of your patience
and understanding.

38:09.354 --> 38:11.071
I don't understand.

38:11.707 --> 38:13.873
This collier thing is crazy.

38:13.909 --> 38:16.793
I promise you,
I will take care of that.

38:17.579 --> 38:18.995
I might have you
sign a contract

38:19.030 --> 38:21.798
to make that legally binding.

38:22.534 --> 38:23.583
Okay.

38:40.402 --> 38:41.484
[andre] hold the door.

38:49.411 --> 38:50.527
Thanks.

39:00.672 --> 39:02.338
Well, this is me.

39:03.625 --> 39:05.959
It was a treat being in
your courtroom today, lola.

39:07.345 --> 39:08.712
It was nice
seeing you as well.

39:16.972 --> 39:18.805
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

39:20.976 --> 39:24.394
You know, seeing you
up on that bench was a trip.

39:24.429 --> 39:26.613
This is what you said
you were gonna do,
and you did it.

39:28.200 --> 39:29.315
I'm proud of you.

39:30.485 --> 39:31.901
Thank you, dre.

39:32.988 --> 39:34.237
I'm proud of you too.

39:36.625 --> 39:38.124
Some things don't change.

39:39.961 --> 39:41.077
Mmm-hmm.

39:42.280 --> 39:44.330
Some things
definitely don't change.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.434
Well, a lot of things
did change.

39:49.171 --> 39:50.587
[sighs]

39:50.622 --> 39:51.888
you know, law school...

39:52.624 --> 39:54.174
Was the time of my life.

39:54.209 --> 39:57.010
Hmm. I thought you were
in such a rush to go out

39:57.062 --> 39:58.845
and take over the world.

40:01.066 --> 40:03.933
But I'd do anything right now
to get those years back.

40:03.968 --> 40:05.802
I find myself sometimes

40:05.821 --> 40:08.438
wondering about all
the fun things
we used to have.

40:10.192 --> 40:11.524
Uh, you...

40:12.477 --> 40:14.194
You remember
that trip to mexico?

40:16.314 --> 40:18.598
Hmm. I do.

40:18.633 --> 40:23.486
Dining on the boats
of the riviera maya
surrounded by the mangroves.

40:23.505 --> 40:25.638
Hiking the ruins at sunset.

40:25.674 --> 40:29.626
Getting food poisoning so bad
that we both almost died.

40:31.046 --> 40:32.278
I mean, going through it.

40:32.314 --> 40:35.331
Where we're both trapped
in a tiny hotel room

40:35.350 --> 40:36.716
with one bathroom.

40:38.353 --> 40:39.469
Yeah...

40:41.106 --> 40:43.022
That'll test
the strongest of loves.
