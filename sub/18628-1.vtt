02:34.640 --> 02:35.780
Charles Ward's escaped.

02:35.840 --> 02:38.879
- How did he get out?
- Looks like he went out the window.

02:39.339 --> 02:43.278
- How did he get loose from his restraints?
- I don't know, doc.

02:45.518 --> 02:47.558
We got one hell of a
mess in there doctor.

02:49.157 --> 02:53.277
I ain't going in there. There's no way
for nothing I'm going in there.

02:57.656 --> 03:00.875
- What's the matter with the light?
- Dealing with it right now, sir.

03:04.875 --> 03:07.434
What in the hell happened here?

03:18.632 --> 03:22.831
- What do you have down there?
- It's Ward's suitcase.

03:57.105 --> 03:58.305
Testing...

04:03.104 --> 04:04.424
Testing...

04:06.664 --> 04:09.983
This closes the case of
Charles Dexter Ward

04:13.902 --> 04:17.902
I'm telling this now, while all the
details are still fresh in my mind

04:20.180 --> 04:22.261
I don't expect anyone to believe this. I...

04:23.261 --> 04:26.020
I don't even know if I believe it myself.

04:28.420 --> 04:30.139
I can't trust my eyes anymore,

04:31.219 --> 04:32.739
even when I sleep.

04:34.939 --> 04:36.778
I haven't slept in days,

04:39.298 --> 04:43.177
but when I do, I hate what I see.

04:46.896 --> 04:49.656
Three weeks ago, Providence
was a sane enough place.

04:50.736 --> 04:52.909
It's a smallish city on a small corner

04:52.910 --> 04:54.976
of the smallest state in the Union.

04:54.995 --> 04:57.234
It's inhabitants enjoy
the eastern sea breeze,

04:57.235 --> 05:00.069
except in the summer when
the river starts to smell.

05:00.104 --> 05:04.103
But that smell is historic, having stunk
since the time of the witch hunts.

05:04.173 --> 05:06.713
The whole place reeks of history.

05:06.733 --> 05:09.892
And history, I've learned,
can jump up and bite you.

05:10.952 --> 05:14.491
This piece of history began
simply enough...

05:17.071 --> 05:21.270
- Good morning. I'm... John March.
- Claire Ward.

05:22.130 --> 05:26.289
Come in, Mrs. Ward.
Have a seat.

05:30.689 --> 05:32.928
- I'll take that for you
- Thank you.

05:37.667 --> 05:40.607
- Would either of you like coffee or tea?
- Nothing, thank you.

05:40.722 --> 05:43.759
I'm fine. Actually, some erm... Tea please.

05:43.794 --> 05:45.067
Yes, sir.

05:52.505 --> 05:56.504
You were recommended to me, Mr. March,
by my friend Elaine James.

05:57.019 --> 05:59.623
Formerly Mrs. Arthur James.

06:00.083 --> 06:03.963
Oh yes, erm, please say
hello to Mrs. James for me.

06:04.023 --> 06:07.559
Elaine said that you
were highly capable.

06:07.694 --> 06:11.553
She also said that I could
trust your discretion.

06:11.561 --> 06:13.081
Thank you.

06:15.441 --> 06:17.480
My husband has moved out of the house.

06:20.360 --> 06:24.359
The police came to our house last night.
They asked me questions.

06:25.359 --> 06:26.599
About what?

06:27.318 --> 06:31.318
About contraband that they
found in Charles' possession.

06:32.558 --> 06:34.277
What sort of contraband?

06:36.677 --> 06:40.596
Apparently, remains from a cemetery.

06:41.516 --> 06:43.556
Do you mean human remains?

06:44.835 --> 06:46.915
I see. And how did your
husband explain that?

06:48.595 --> 06:52.594
I don't know. I haven't spoken to him
for more than two weeks.

06:54.354 --> 06:57.953
I've tried to reach him, but
he seems to be avoiding me.

06:59.313 --> 07:03.032
Our wedding anniversary
is coming up, and...

07:04.952 --> 07:08.951
Do you mind? It's just a tool of the trade.

07:13.950 --> 07:15.830
Why did Charles move out?

07:17.989 --> 07:21.789
I erm... I suppose I drove him out

07:23.269 --> 07:26.461
It was the night of October 1st,
and we were hosting a fundraiser

07:26.496 --> 07:29.688
for Senator O'Neils re-election campaign.

07:30.587 --> 07:32.815
Half way through the evening,
Charles said that...

07:32.850 --> 07:35.507
he had work that couldn't
wait, and just left.

07:35.766 --> 07:38.426
Hey, stop. What's going on?

07:38.486 --> 07:40.700
Darling, there's some work I have to do
that simply can't wait.

07:40.701 --> 07:42.485
- Now?
- Yes, now.

07:42.520 --> 07:45.385
In the middle of party with all these
guests here, you can't just leave now.

07:45.445 --> 07:48.492
Well, I'm sorry. Please offer them
my apologies. Tell them I'm sorry,

07:48.527 --> 07:50.274
I had to go. Alright?

07:50.309 --> 07:54.308
...and left all those people standing there
and went out to the carriage house.

07:54.744 --> 07:56.784
He'd built himself a laboratory out there.

07:57.102 --> 07:58.422
A laboratory?

07:58.822 --> 08:02.621
My husband is the head of chemical
engineering for Belmont Cosmetics.

08:03.761 --> 08:07.761
Long after everyone had left,
he was still carrying on in there.

08:08.940 --> 08:12.940
- What do you mean, 'carrying on'?
- I don't know what he was doing.

08:14.219 --> 08:17.388
There were awful
smells coming from the

08:17.401 --> 08:21.218
carriage house. A lot of noises.
Loud shouting.

08:22.538 --> 08:23.938
Shouting?

08:24.518 --> 08:27.577
All I know is that
I wanted him to stop.

08:27.877 --> 08:29.673
I erm...

08:30.008 --> 08:32.614
I guess I lost it. I screamed
at him that he'd have to...

08:32.615 --> 08:35.998
find some other place for whatever
it was he was doing...

08:36.035 --> 08:38.044
You're going to have to
find some other place

08:38.058 --> 08:40.034
to do whatever it is
you're doing out there!

08:47.473 --> 08:51.333
The next morning, I saw him loading
his equipment into a van.

08:53.092 --> 08:57.092
And then I saw he was with
that man, that Dr. Ash.

08:58.352 --> 09:00.011
Who's Dr. Ash?

09:00.046 --> 09:02.771
I don't know, somebody Charles met.

09:06.210 --> 09:10.209
I've found a better place to work.
I'm sorry it took so long.

09:12.209 --> 09:13.809
Sorry about last night.

09:15.409 --> 09:17.168
You've been so patient.

09:19.288 --> 09:22.127
Charles, what is it?
What are you working on?

09:24.207 --> 09:30.206
I promise... I promise I'll tell you
everything when the time's right.

09:32.945 --> 09:34.625
Trust me?

09:36.485 --> 09:38.564
Do you trust him?

09:40.604 --> 09:44.603
He's my husband, and I love him.

09:47.015 --> 09:49.803
And I believe he's sincere.

09:52.642 --> 09:55.321
How did the police get involved?

09:56.561 --> 09:59.301
A man named Lucius Fenner called me.

09:59.336 --> 10:01.345
He's an old, retired
gentleman who lives across

10:01.358 --> 10:03.335
the River Road from where
Charles set up shop.

10:05.020 --> 10:07.208
Mr. Fenner was complaining that Charles

10:07.209 --> 10:09.659
was working all night...

10:09.694 --> 10:12.178
and keeping him awake,
receiving deliveries at all hours.

10:12.213 --> 10:15.930
But apparently, Charles
ignored his complaints,

10:15.958 --> 10:19.957
until Mr. Fenner's fighting
nature was aroused.

10:25.356 --> 10:27.416
And Fenner called the cops...

10:27.456 --> 10:31.395
Yes, and they showed up just as Charles
was receiving another shipment of...

10:32.235 --> 10:33.954
...those long boxes.

10:40.633 --> 10:42.433
I want to know what he's doing.

10:44.553 --> 10:48.552
Mrs. Ward, you wouldn't happen to have your
husbands social security number, would you?

10:50.312 --> 10:51.831
What are you going to do, audit him?

10:52.031 --> 10:54.779
No, no, it's just the way
we work today.

10:54.814 --> 10:58.371
But that one number gets me his entire
life. There's a lot of shoe leather.

11:01.070 --> 11:04.549
Well I can get it for you. Does that
mean you'll take the case?

11:10.448 --> 11:12.336
I'll tell you what.

11:13.170 --> 11:16.848
I'll take a drive out, to see
what Charles is up to.

11:17.267 --> 11:22.266
Doesn't look like it's on the level, well,
we'll discuss my taking your case.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.228
How does that sound?

11:25.263 --> 11:28.386
- I appreciate it, Mr. March.
- My pleasure.

11:40.103 --> 11:42.610
And don't forget, your husbands
social security number.

11:42.611 --> 11:43.943
I won't.

11:47.381 --> 11:50.661
- Not too shabby, boss.
- Take it easy, Lonnie.

11:51.441 --> 11:53.440
So, what did miss manners want?

11:53.460 --> 11:57.220
Oh, same old story. Husband's
dabbling in grave robbery.

11:57.255 --> 11:58.719
What?

11:58.754 --> 12:02.499
I don't know, that's why I'm a detective.
To find out all about what I don't know.

12:03.259 --> 12:05.118
Well, are you going to take the case?

12:06.578 --> 12:09.937
Softly softly catchie monkey. OK?

12:10.517 --> 12:12.190
Lonnie, erm...

12:12.425 --> 12:16.424
Call your contact in the PD. Find out what
really happened out in the Ward place.

12:17.935 --> 12:21.934
Pawtuxet Valley. Sunday. OK?

12:24.775 --> 12:26.254
- You got it, boss.
- Thanks.

12:26.289 --> 12:30.289
- Gee, she was pretty!
- Polly, she is a client.

12:34.853 --> 12:37.819
I'd spent the better part
of my life in Providence,

12:37.854 --> 12:40.913
but I'd never ventured out
to the Pawtuxet valley.

12:41.092 --> 12:44.809
You always got a strange feeling when
you met someone from the valley, like...

12:44.810 --> 12:46.812
like maybe they were hiding something.

13:20.125 --> 13:21.565
Hello?

13:31.023 --> 13:32.683
Anybody here?

13:40.001 --> 13:42.821
You're standing in dogs blood.

13:43.701 --> 13:45.057
Dang mutt,

13:45.092 --> 13:49.092
ran in front of the truck out front.
Splattered everywhere.

13:52.159 --> 13:54.447
Last few weeks we had
a lot of trouble with...

13:54.482 --> 13:56.819
...wild dogs round here.

13:56.878 --> 14:00.878
Running into trucks, wrapping themselves
around axles. What a mess.

14:03.993 --> 14:05.312
Hey...

14:05.347 --> 14:09.346
- Could I have some gas if you don't mind.
- No problem, come on.

14:10.216 --> 14:14.155
Listen, I'm looking for the Ward place
out on, erm, River Road.

14:14.275 --> 14:17.855
Couldn't find it on my map. Could you
point me in the right direction?

14:21.954 --> 14:23.833
Ward, huh?

14:36.031 --> 14:40.031
Could you be a little more specific?
I've been driving for almost two hours.

14:41.290 --> 14:45.290
Just keep your window down, the smell
will take you right up the driveway.

14:45.585 --> 14:49.119
The smell?
What kind of smell?

14:49.154 --> 14:51.444
Like that dog.

14:51.479 --> 14:54.096
Smells like death.

14:55.118 --> 14:56.469
Thanks.

14:59.387 --> 15:02.396
No mail box, no address...

15:02.631 --> 15:05.961
1.6 miles south east of the gas station,

15:05.996 --> 15:08.692
just past the cemetery.

15:09.160 --> 15:12.026
You start to smell it half a mile away.

15:12.505 --> 15:14.994
You'd have to pay me...

15:15.029 --> 15:18.065
five figures to go there after dark.

16:49.328 --> 16:51.487
Hank O'Hara, fire inspectors office.

16:51.927 --> 16:54.847
We've got a report that some flammable
materials are being stored here.

16:55.286 --> 16:58.886
We'll need to inspect the premises.
Are you Mr. Ward?

17:00.526 --> 17:04.525
I see. Then could you call Mr. Ward
to the door please?

17:08.644 --> 17:10.084
Raymond...

17:14.363 --> 17:16.002
I'm Charles Ward,
what can I do for you?

17:16.522 --> 17:19.642
Fire inspectors office. We got a call
from the police about...

17:19.801 --> 17:22.262
some hazardous chemicals being
stored here without a permit.

17:22.297 --> 17:24.568
All that business was
taken care of yesterday.

17:24.580 --> 17:25.340
I see.

17:25.376 --> 17:28.300
- You mind if I look around?
- Yes. I do, I mind very much!

17:28.336 --> 17:30.080
Do you have a warrant?

17:30.220 --> 17:33.283
Actually I'd like to know what kind of
research you might be doing out here,

17:33.318 --> 17:35.559
what kind of chemicals
you might be using.

17:35.594 --> 17:38.679
I noticed a very peculiar smell.

17:40.218 --> 17:44.218
The smell is from the remains of lab
animals that I haven't cremated yet.

17:45.433 --> 17:48.692
When I do, I assure you
that it will be in...

17:48.727 --> 17:51.597
a small incinerator with
every precaution

17:51.656 --> 17:53.436
...respectfully taken.

17:54.716 --> 17:56.727
One more thing, sir...

17:56.762 --> 18:00.762
do you mind telling me what was
in those long boxes of yours?

18:01.650 --> 18:04.370
I'm afraid that's none
of your business.

18:04.605 --> 18:06.235
Good day.

18:14.832 --> 18:20.831
So, Charles Ward pulls up stakes and
moves to the country. So what?

18:21.991 --> 18:24.968
Maybe he does need
time to himself.

18:25.103 --> 18:28.111
Maybe Claire's driving him crazy.

18:29.510 --> 18:33.509
- What you want on your dog?
- I'd like... erm...

18:37.588 --> 18:39.008
Thanks.

18:54.625 --> 18:58.365
VANDALISM AT CEMETERY

19:01.604 --> 19:03.464
- Hello?
- It's me.

19:03.864 --> 19:05.298
Lonnie, what have
you got for me?

19:05.333 --> 19:07.143
Yeah, about the raid
on Wards place.

19:07.243 --> 19:09.257
Yeah, the raid. You mean
the police?

19:09.292 --> 19:11.782
That's the one.
You ready for this?

19:11.862 --> 19:15.861
The cops found eight, count 'em,
eight boxes of human remains.

19:16.112 --> 19:19.321
Nothing fresh mind you, old bones.
Pretty stale too.

19:19.356 --> 19:22.455
Ward said it was all a shipping mistake,
but here comes the good part.

19:22.490 --> 19:26.041
Somebody down the precinct remembers
this tip they got about drug smugglers,

19:26.042 --> 19:29.539
smuggling corpus dilecti's
along with their dope.

19:29.574 --> 19:32.238
They ran a check through Interpol.
Turns out they've

19:32.251 --> 19:34.573
had a rash of tomb
snatchings over in Europe.

19:35.413 --> 19:37.018
38 in one month.

19:37.078 --> 19:41.077
Honorius I, Cosimo Ruggeri,
Walter Bauld, Nickolai Simanof

19:44.746 --> 19:47.456
and a bunch of other names
I can't even pronounce.

19:47.457 --> 19:50.110
You want to guess what all
these individuals had in common?

19:50.145 --> 19:51.535
They're all dead?

19:51.536 --> 19:55.214
They were all wizards, magicians,
or occult scholars.

19:55.374 --> 19:58.534
What's the street value
of wizards bones?

19:58.794 --> 20:00.256
How 'bout this?

20:00.291 --> 20:03.882
Maybe somebody out there's collecting
them like baseball cards.

20:03.883 --> 20:06.372
And maybe, Ward
is the man to see.

20:06.407 --> 20:08.132
Are the cops going to do
anything about it?

20:08.167 --> 20:09.534
No.

20:09.569 --> 20:13.012
The guys clean as a whistle and
connected as hell. Old money.

20:13.231 --> 20:14.629
Anything else?

20:14.664 --> 20:16.471
Else!?

20:16.706 --> 20:20.072
What the hell else you want
for one afternoon? Jesus!

20:22.090 --> 20:24.209
How long have you and
Charles known each other?

20:24.309 --> 20:26.609
Not long. A few months.

20:26.644 --> 20:29.428
Mr. March, are you trying
to prepare me for something?

20:29.463 --> 20:33.208
If so, I wish you'd just come out
with it, I want the truth.

20:36.927 --> 20:39.726
Okay, here's what I have so far.

20:41.246 --> 20:44.990
A truck drops some bones off
at your husbands place.

20:45.025 --> 20:48.578
Your husband claims its
a mistake, but if so,

20:48.613 --> 20:50.704
why does he sign the shipping
order and still have the cargo

20:50.717 --> 20:52.612
in his possession 2 days later
when the police arrive?

20:54.119 --> 20:56.743
Plus the sender turns out
to be a dummy company

20:56.778 --> 20:59.563
My guess is, it wasn't a mistake.

21:01.083 --> 21:04.442
What possible use could Charles
have for human remains?

21:04.602 --> 21:08.321
- When did he first begin acting strange?
- When?

21:10.860 --> 21:14.859
When? When that trunk arrived, Erm...
6 months ago, that shipping trunk.

21:16.560 --> 21:19.839
You see, he'd been contacted by
an attorney who was settling an estate.

21:20.119 --> 21:22.759
He'd been mentioned in the will
of some obscure relative.

21:23.399 --> 21:27.398
He'd never been what I'd call passionately
interested in his family roots before,

21:28.166 --> 21:30.737
but he found something
interesting in that trunk.

21:30.772 --> 21:32.377
What was in the trunk?

21:32.412 --> 21:36.411
Family papers, wills, family trees,
letters, genealogies,

21:37.753 --> 21:40.096
...old bibles. Stuff like that.

21:41.095 --> 21:43.405
It seems that all these
old papers made mention...

21:43.440 --> 21:47.439
of a man that was referred to as
the true father of Jacob Ward.

21:47.816 --> 21:49.877
What was this guys name?

21:49.878 --> 21:52.736
- Joseph Curwen.
- Who was he?

21:52.771 --> 21:56.233
He was reputed to be
some sort of magician.

21:56.433 --> 21:59.944
And the documents said he had
some farmhouse in Pawtuxet Valley

21:59.945 --> 22:02.393
so we drove out there
to see if it was still there.

22:02.512 --> 22:05.589
It didn't seem that the
house had been lived in for

22:05.602 --> 22:08.511
a long time, so Charles
went ahead and broke in.

22:20.069 --> 22:22.148
Hand me that flashlight will you?

22:29.367 --> 22:31.456
I think you'd better stay there
for a minute, honey.

22:31.457 --> 22:32.767
Alright.

23:32.256 --> 23:34.455
Now that's a little strange.

23:36.095 --> 23:37.077
What?

23:37.112 --> 23:40.395
Why would someone put wallpaper
right over a mantle?

23:48.573 --> 23:50.132
Something...

23:52.292 --> 23:54.452
Holy...

24:01.970 --> 24:04.130
He brought it home and had it restored.

24:04.270 --> 24:06.184
It was uncanny.

24:06.219 --> 24:09.730
It could have been a portrait
of Charles himself.

24:09.969 --> 24:10.837
What do you mean?

24:10.838 --> 24:14.649
I mean Curwen looked
exactly like Charles.

24:14.768 --> 24:15.780
What?

24:15.781 --> 24:17.688
You can see it if you like,
it's in the house.

24:17.723 --> 24:19.287
Yeah, I'd like to see it.

24:20.287 --> 24:24.286
That's when he set up that lab in
the carriage house, and became secretive.

24:24.507 --> 24:27.871
When I asked him what he was doing,
he said he'd found some more old papers

24:27.872 --> 24:31.179
that contained remarkable secrets of...

24:31.214 --> 24:34.986
early scientific knowledge,
or something to that effect.

25:07.759 --> 25:09.398
There it is.

25:12.738 --> 25:15.997
- Can I get you something?
- No thanks.

25:49.331 --> 25:51.471
Two months before the wedding.

25:51.506 --> 25:55.505
First time I saw that smile I was done for

25:55.907 --> 25:58.731
couldn't take my eyes off him.

26:02.349 --> 26:06.348
It was at the marina. He didn't say
anything, he just smiled at me.

26:07.788 --> 26:09.468
Great teeth.

26:11.747 --> 26:15.626
When you smile, Mr. March, it's like
you're holding something back.

26:19.886 --> 26:23.285
I'd like to see the carriage house
if you don't mind.

27:10.937 --> 27:12.756
That's the trunk.

27:42.491 --> 27:44.991
Yeah, this is John March.
Any messages?

27:45.730 --> 27:49.730
Yes, Mr. March, you received
a call from a Lucius Fenner.

27:50.230 --> 27:53.789
Fenner?
Fenner called me?

27:53.929 --> 27:55.347
Yes, sir.

27:55.382 --> 27:59.369
He left his phone number and address,
and he said it was an emergency.

28:01.328 --> 28:02.927
Give me the phone number.

28:02.928 --> 28:05.288
555-1330.

28:06.527 --> 28:07.906
Thank you.

28:12.226 --> 28:16.225
We're sorry, this number
is temporarily out of service.

28:57.238 --> 28:59.268
John March, P.I.

28:59.703 --> 29:01.417
What's going on?

29:01.452 --> 29:03.607
Wait here, sir.

29:03.841 --> 29:05.377
Sure.

29:14.215 --> 29:17.674
- What brings you out this way, Mr...
- March, John March.

29:18.614 --> 29:22.113
Lucius Fenner called me.
What happened?

29:22.213 --> 29:23.858
What's your interest
in Mr. Fenner?

29:23.893 --> 29:25.954
Well he's connected to
a case I'm investigating.

29:25.955 --> 29:29.392
I've no specific interest
in Fenner himself.

29:29.527 --> 29:31.556
What happened here?

29:31.691 --> 29:34.072
Come with me, Mr. March.

29:39.670 --> 29:41.460
We got a call from a neighbor.

29:41.461 --> 29:44.273
Said she heard a lot of loud noises
over here. Screams,

29:44.308 --> 29:48.111
furniture breaking,
that kind of thing.

29:48.349 --> 29:52.348
She got worried, seeing
as how Fenner lives here by himself.

29:53.668 --> 29:55.187
There's Fenner.

30:03.426 --> 30:05.445
We think it was an animal attack.

30:05.480 --> 30:08.886
Could be wild dogs,
but I don't buy it.

30:11.244 --> 30:13.304
Would you excuse me?

33:55.604 --> 33:59.164
John. Did you sleep here?

34:00.704 --> 34:02.413
John, you're not going
to take all of those!

34:02.414 --> 34:05.484
Holly, I'm already had
one mother, yeah!

34:05.623 --> 34:08.610
Do you think you'd make some coffee?
Please.

34:08.623 --> 34:09.621
Right away.

34:14.841 --> 34:18.840
- Quit smoking.
- Lonnie, that's wonderful. Good for you!

34:19.020 --> 34:22.481
God, your clothes won't smell bad anymore,
and you're going to live longer.

34:22.516 --> 34:25.918
You've just done a wonderful thing for
yourself. Tell me, is it difficult to do?

34:25.920 --> 34:29.918
Nah, when I make up my mind
to something, I just do it.

34:31.858 --> 34:33.438
Good luck.

34:35.757 --> 34:38.516
- Quit smoking.
- Why?

34:38.552 --> 34:42.440
My girlfriend was on my case.
You look like you slept here.

34:42.476 --> 34:45.976
Give me a minute and
I'll be my usual, debonair self.

34:50.335 --> 34:53.313
- Yuck! Get out of that filthy shirt.
- Some coffee, please.

34:53.349 --> 34:55.945
Yes, I can't make the
water boil any faster.

34:55.954 --> 34:57.433
- You're helping?
- Yes

34:57.613 --> 35:00.013
You take the top and I'll take the bottom.

35:01.033 --> 35:03.012
Would you like me to leave?

35:05.072 --> 35:07.572
Take that one off,
and put this one on.

35:12.011 --> 35:14.696
You're going to have to wait
out in the reception area.

35:14.709 --> 35:16.010
It's okay, Holly, thanks.

35:24.049 --> 35:27.048
- Sorry about my appearance.
- Just had to stop by to give you this.

35:31.207 --> 35:33.207
Come on, have a seat.

35:33.247 --> 35:36.306
- Like some coffee, tea, anything?
- No. Thank you.

35:40.666 --> 35:44.665
- I guess you've heard about Fenner.
- Mr. Fenner. What about him?

35:46.925 --> 35:50.924
- He was killed last night.
- My God. How?

35:52.004 --> 35:55.883
They're not sure, they think...
They think an animal did it.

35:58.243 --> 36:01.322
- What's on the tape?
- It's Charles.

36:13.920 --> 36:17.919
Claire... Claire... It's Charles...
Are you there?

36:20.239 --> 36:24.238
Honey, if you still love me,
please be there...

36:24.578 --> 36:29.118
I need help, Claire. I think I made
a mistake... a terrible mistake.

36:29.219 --> 36:32.106
I'm scared.
I'm scared for you.

36:32.916 --> 36:34.100
You've got to listen to me.

36:34.501 --> 36:37.648
Whatever happens,
keep away from Dr. Ash.

36:37.655 --> 36:40.475
Don't let him in the house,
don't even talk to him. He's...

37:08.190 --> 37:10.330
Remember me?
The fire inspector?

37:10.350 --> 37:14.349
We're here to see Mr. Ward.
Don't give me that crap!

37:15.889 --> 37:18.167
This is his wife, she wants
to see her husband.

37:18.202 --> 37:19.649
Charles!

37:21.648 --> 37:25.647
- Open the door, Spike.
- Let them in, Raymond.

37:28.706 --> 37:32.446
We may as well talk now, as ever...

37:49.323 --> 37:53.162
- Charles...
- You must excuse my speech

37:53.362 --> 37:57.361
I'm grown phthisical
from this cursed river air.

38:00.941 --> 38:03.820
I suppose you've come
to see what ails me.

38:04.280 --> 38:06.260
I trust you'll find
nothing to alarm you.

38:06.460 --> 38:09.739
Charles, we have to get you to a doctor.

38:10.799 --> 38:14.698
I'm already under the care
of Dr. Ash. He is the most able.

38:14.733 --> 38:17.718
Where is this Dr. Ash?
I'd like to meet him.

38:17.738 --> 38:21.597
He had business
to attend to, elsewhere.

38:22.697 --> 38:25.590
Sweetheart, it's not too
late for you to come

38:25.603 --> 38:28.696
back with me, before
something terrible happens.

38:30.095 --> 38:34.095
Do not fret my dear.
There is no evil in what I do

38:35.370 --> 38:38.234
so long as I do it rightly.

38:42.713 --> 38:46.712
Sweetheart, do you know
what Saturday is?

38:48.112 --> 38:52.909
- It's our anniversary.
- How thoughtless of me.

38:53.531 --> 38:57.059
It appears you have
married an oaf.

38:57.829 --> 39:01.828
But do you know, I'm on the
threshold of great things.

39:03.055 --> 39:07.054
and the bigness of them, leaves room
for little else in my thoughts.

39:07.749 --> 39:11.188
I need to know what is
so incredibly important out here.

39:11.189 --> 39:14.468
If you'd have the goodness
to wait six weeks.

39:15.487 --> 39:19.487
I will show you, what will
pay your patience well.

39:22.841 --> 39:26.840
You can't expect us to leave here without
some explanation of what you're up to.

39:27.460 --> 39:31.460
It is nothing less than
the interrogation of mater.

39:32.944 --> 39:36.944
The proper pursuit of which requires
unbending concentration, and solitude.

39:56.760 --> 40:00.292
Thank you for your patience
and for your solicitude.

40:39.560 --> 40:41.818
That's not my husband.

40:43.415 --> 40:47.411
Has he ever talked that way before,
you know, using antiquated language?

40:47.972 --> 40:49.429
No.

40:50.748 --> 40:54.743
Have you ever heard about those erm...
What do you call 'em, "trance channelers"?

40:55.335 --> 40:58.269
People who claim that
the dead speak through them.

40:58.270 --> 40:59.738
Yeah.

40:59.997 --> 41:02.522
I read once about a kid
up in New Hampshire...

41:02.523 --> 41:05.692
who took on the personality
of his dead grandfather.

41:05.726 --> 41:09.722
I mean he talked like him, thought like
him, knew things only he would know.

41:10.326 --> 41:14.322
- Are you saying that Charles is possessed?
- No, no, no. It's a...

41:14.517 --> 41:17.887
I think he's convinced himself
that he's possessed...

41:17.922 --> 41:21.156
by the ghost of Curwen or
whatever you want to call it.

41:21.295 --> 41:24.496
Either that, or somebody's
got him talked into it

41:24.530 --> 41:27.868
Some third party, like
this Dr. Ash for instance.

41:30.504 --> 41:32.838
Do you have any suggestions?

41:32.873 --> 41:36.378
Yes I do!
But you're not gonna like it.

41:36.418 --> 41:38.796
I don't like any of this.

41:39.454 --> 41:43.330
There was no question in my mind,
that Charles had gone over the edge.

41:43.570 --> 41:46.007
The trick was, proving it to Claire.

41:46.227 --> 41:48.724
She just wasn't ready
to accept the truth.

41:52.700 --> 41:54.218
Is that unusual?

41:54.253 --> 41:58.154
...they're obviously been down it
again and then right through here.

41:58.189 --> 41:59.912
Right onto your property?

42:03.728 --> 42:06.563
They were all placed by
that fella with the eye.

42:06.599 --> 42:08.484
Can I see that?

42:11.280 --> 42:14.033
Doesn't this seem like an awful lot
of meat for just 3 people?

42:14.068 --> 42:17.050
I'll tell ya, it's more than we ship
to most restaurants in a month.

42:17.051 --> 42:19.054
And nobody orders
fresh blood but him.

42:19.091 --> 42:22.247
We got a truck dialed-in special
from New Jersey slaughterhouse.

42:22.927 --> 42:25.364
Lonnie, what's the story
on Mr. err... Eyeball?

42:25.724 --> 42:27.755
His name is Raymond Chang.
Cheap muscle from

42:27.768 --> 42:29.720
Hong Kong. Doesn't speak
a lot of English.

42:31.478 --> 42:32.956
See the tracks on
that guys arms?

42:33.196 --> 42:37.192
He was a low-level drug runner
before he went to work for Charles.

42:38.829 --> 42:40.308
Tell him about the bank.

42:40.309 --> 42:43.365
- Oh, yes. The bank called.
- What about?

42:43.400 --> 42:46.521
Charles' cheques. The signatures
look like forgeries.

42:47.061 --> 42:49.129
- Doctor Ash.
- Apparently not

42:49.130 --> 42:52.526
The bank sent a man out to the
farmhouse to ask Charles about it.

42:52.561 --> 42:56.452
Charles claims that's some
nervous problem with his hands.

42:56.670 --> 42:58.508
It's a nervous problem all right.

42:58.509 --> 43:01.564
Lonnie, what is this here
you wrote about tunneling?

43:02.264 --> 43:03.485
Yeah, that's Mrs. Bishop.

43:03.486 --> 43:05.346
She said she found what
looked like a couple

43:05.359 --> 43:06.939
of collapsed tunnels
on her property.

43:06.974 --> 43:10.451
But that's coming from a lady
who's blottoed by 10:00 am.

43:10.486 --> 43:12.732
What about Dr. Ash?

43:14.790 --> 43:18.507
We learned more about the meat industry
than we are about Dr. Ash.

43:22.462 --> 43:25.459
Look Mrs. Ward,
we're just detectives.

43:26.178 --> 43:29.255
Your husband needs intervention.

43:30.014 --> 43:33.769
It would only be a temporary step,
say 30 days.

43:34.469 --> 43:37.178
And what if it's not temporary?

43:50.454 --> 43:52.113
Mr. Ward!

43:53.073 --> 43:55.072
- Check that out there.
- Yes sir.

44:07.290 --> 44:09.250
Mr. Ward!

44:13.569 --> 44:16.408
Scott, you take that room.
The rest of you, come with me.

44:39.342 --> 44:42.601
- Allow me to go first, sir.
- Be my guest.

45:24.632 --> 45:26.692
Charles...

45:47.467 --> 45:49.087
- Is this Ward?
- No.

45:49.466 --> 45:51.026
Who is this guy anyway?

45:51.046 --> 45:52.766
A druggie who works for Ward.

45:52.800 --> 45:55.105
Get the cuffs on him and
let's get him out of here.

45:56.364 --> 45:57.924
Come on...

46:23.318 --> 46:24.798
Watch the steps here.

46:26.078 --> 46:27.678
Careful with him.

46:27.679 --> 46:29.397
You were warned...

46:34.816 --> 46:37.635
I'd put that down if
I were you, Mr. Ward...

46:37.670 --> 46:40.175
And don't... Don't hurt Claire.

46:42.894 --> 46:44.833
Careful, March.

46:44.868 --> 46:48.867
You can walk. You can go free.
Just give me the scalpel.

47:01.269 --> 47:03.855
Jesus! You gotta get that looked at.

47:03.890 --> 47:06.590
Crazy son-of-a-bitch!

47:08.668 --> 47:10.388
C'mere, come on over here.

47:35.222 --> 47:38.636
You have made the most...

47:38.737 --> 47:41.734
damnable mistake!

48:23.210 --> 48:25.070
Hold him still!

48:46.525 --> 48:49.304
This is Dr. Lyman, Charles.

48:49.339 --> 48:52.625
She's going to ask you
a few questions.

48:52.860 --> 48:56.859
Your cooperation
would be appreciated.

49:09.660 --> 49:13.280
Hello, Charles.
How are you feeling?

49:14.399 --> 49:16.199
Unspeakable...

49:16.259 --> 49:19.597
Maybe if we speak about it,
you might feel better.

49:29.356 --> 49:33.355
There's a note here, Charles. It says
you didn't eat your dinner last night.

49:38.154 --> 49:40.353
Was there a problem with it?

49:40.473 --> 49:42.032
Problem?

49:44.612 --> 49:47.276
I must have raw meat.

49:47.510 --> 49:51.509
Not disgusting, seared,
burnt flesh.

49:51.970 --> 49:55.969
It is blood, I must have the blood. Your
kitchen drains the blood from the meat.

50:03.567 --> 50:06.596
Are you in control of your body?

50:06.631 --> 50:09.427
For the present, yes.

50:11.706 --> 50:15.705
But I warn you,
once the hunger grows

50:16.309 --> 50:19.784
my control will surely weaken.

50:19.819 --> 50:23.818
And if it weakens,
what is it you think might happen?

50:27.542 --> 50:31.541
It will be a damnable mess.

50:35.621 --> 50:39.620
Now in regards to Charles,
the curious physical details,

50:41.543 --> 50:47.542
the abhorrent metabolism, the uneven
respiratory and cardiovascular patterns,

50:49.197 --> 50:52.464
the excessively dry, flaking skin.
Are all explainable

50:52.477 --> 50:55.696
on the basis of autonomic,
and hormonal dysfunctions.

50:57.275 --> 50:59.108
Secondary to his...

50:59.109 --> 51:02.855
anxious obsession with his
dead relative that you've spoken of.

51:03.054 --> 51:09.053
Less easy to explain, is his peculiar
fixation he has on blood, and raw meat.

51:11.792 --> 51:15.791
What are you saying here, doctor?
Is the man curable?

51:16.671 --> 51:20.670
About the best we can hope for at
this point, is to somehow diminish...

51:20.725 --> 51:24.676
Charles' homicidal and...

51:24.877 --> 51:27.491
cannibalistic impulses.

52:03.975 --> 52:07.285
- What are you doing here?
- I couldn't sleep.

52:13.408 --> 52:15.881
I think I've found
something here.

52:18.833 --> 52:20.409
What is it?

52:37.632 --> 52:40.927
Diary of Ezra Ward, 1771.

52:42.713 --> 52:44.322
So let me get this straight

52:44.357 --> 52:48.357
Joseph Curwen comes to Pawtuxet,
nobody knows from where, in 1700s.

52:48.517 --> 52:49.944
before the revolution.

52:49.945 --> 52:53.734
Yeah, he was a real
"founding father".

52:54.154 --> 52:57.383
Okay. He sets himself up in the
shipping business and gets rich quick

52:57.384 --> 52:59.264
but nobody likes the
guy because he's got a

52:59.277 --> 53:01.384
reputation for hanging
around local grave yards.

53:01.815 --> 53:04.656
The word witchcraft
comes up a lot.

53:04.676 --> 53:06.833
Well yeah, you can traffic
in a lot of nasty

53:06.846 --> 53:08.676
stuff with your own
shipping business

53:09.230 --> 53:10.577
Anything you want.

53:10.612 --> 53:12.988
There was a lot of smuggling
going on back then.

53:13.023 --> 53:17.024
You know, rum, other contraband.
It was the patriotic thing to do.

53:19.137 --> 53:21.392
So, talk to me about this diary.

53:21.428 --> 53:25.428
Ezra Ward was Charles'
five times great grandfather.

53:25.599 --> 53:28.506
- He lived at the same time as Curwen.
- What else does it say?

53:28.540 --> 53:31.678
It says that Curwen
stole Ezra's girl.

53:31.679 --> 53:34.340
- No kidding.
- Yeah. Listen to this...

53:37.700 --> 53:39.978
6 October

53:40.014 --> 53:43.197
Over the last few nights, I've ventured out
to Curwen's farm house

53:43.198 --> 53:46.719
in the hope of proving
the vile rumor is true.

53:46.720 --> 53:50.721
From Eliza's letters I am convinced
that her heart belongs still to me.

53:51.423 --> 53:53.529
It is only the fiends
wealth and her fathers

53:53.542 --> 53:55.423
greed that have gained
him such a wife.

53:57.422 --> 54:01.262
That, or the infernal power
of his black arts.

54:02.903 --> 54:06.904
7 October:
Curwen was gone to port

54:07.348 --> 54:10.984
I met Eliza,
as we had planned.

54:26.926 --> 54:29.817
Ezra, I must tell thee.

54:29.818 --> 54:33.748
I'm fearful Joseph is truly
practicing the black arts,

54:33.749 --> 54:35.547
as is said in town.

54:35.582 --> 54:38.267
What has thou seen, Eliza, tell me.

54:38.307 --> 54:42.154
Lately, he's been receiving
strange cargo's from the Indies.

54:42.155 --> 54:44.237
and 4 nights ago, he
came up from the cellar

54:44.250 --> 54:46.156
with the most dreadful
wound on his arm.

54:53.829 --> 54:55.269
Joseph?

54:56.090 --> 54:57.950
Joseph, what has happened?

54:59.530 --> 55:02.394
Thou art bleeding.
I must fetch Dr. Hopkins.

55:02.395 --> 55:04.031
No!

55:06.391 --> 55:08.471
It is to be expected...

55:08.991 --> 55:12.532
The dead take much blood.

55:12.571 --> 55:13.901
11 October.

55:14.602 --> 55:19.061
I have spent three sleepless nights
to make my case against Curwen.

55:19.913 --> 55:23.155
After what I have viewed,
I am convinced...

55:23.156 --> 55:27.158
that Joseph Curwen, is indeed
practicing witchcraft.

55:28.633 --> 55:31.453
I counted 2 deliveries
made on the ninth.

55:31.488 --> 55:34.788
The first was a load of slaughtered cattle,
directly to the front door.

55:34.789 --> 55:36.674
- Are they fresh?
- Yes sir, yes.

55:36.874 --> 55:38.398
Each night thereafter,

55:38.399 --> 55:42.400
more cattle were delivered
by the Negro they called, "Old Ezza".

55:43.496 --> 55:46.316
The next delivery came in
the boat of two Chinamen

55:46.435 --> 55:50.276
who brought with them what
could only have been, coffins.

55:51.456 --> 55:54.138
But it was in the morning of
the 3rd day that I discovered

55:54.139 --> 55:58.039
the door by the riverbank
below the Curwen's house

55:58.298 --> 56:02.297
leading to what subterranean catacomb,
I know not.

56:10.359 --> 56:12.240
12 October:

56:12.275 --> 56:15.899
I wasted no time in
assembling the town fathers.

56:16.033 --> 56:20.034
While they deliberated, heavy rains washed
away large sections of the riverbank.

56:23.101 --> 56:27.101
...what followed will
not be soon forgot.

57:05.805 --> 57:09.806
That abomination, or devil,
was burnt by the high sheriff.

57:43.571 --> 57:45.691
Plans were laid for Curwen.

57:48.011 --> 57:52.011
At 10 in the night, on Friday October 13,
the year of our lord 1771

57:53.572 --> 57:56.134
a company of 100 privateers,

57:56.169 --> 57:59.388
led by some of the
most learned men in town,

57:59.422 --> 58:01.893
marched on Curwen's farm.

58:50.018 --> 58:52.868
Ezra, I'm afraid.

58:53.936 --> 58:57.541
I have his child within me.

59:04.960 --> 59:07.040
That's where it ends.

59:07.821 --> 59:09.390
What?

59:09.425 --> 59:11.202
Or it begins...

59:11.237 --> 59:13.781
Wait a minute,
you mean that's it?

59:14.302 --> 59:16.542
What about the raid?
What happened to Curwen?

59:16.577 --> 59:20.577
Oh shit, that's frustrating.
Why the hell would he stop there?

59:24.383 --> 59:26.583
So Curwen is the real great, great...
whatever

59:26.596 --> 59:28.383
grandfather of
Charles, and not Ezra.

59:30.341 --> 59:32.105
Looks that way, doesn't it?

59:33.183 --> 59:35.645
And he was a monster maker?

59:35.680 --> 59:39.680
In local news today, another gruesome
murder has thrown the state into panic.

59:40.220 --> 59:43.819
Police officials are still hunting
the person, or persons, responsible

59:43.854 --> 59:47.854
for last nights killing of Mrs. Anna Bishop
at her home in Pawtuxet.

59:48.101 --> 59:51.267
It was the night for bizarre violence
in the city as well,

59:51.306 --> 59:54.667
in what appears to be a
related case of animal attack,

59:54.827 --> 59:58.488
a man has been found brutally slain
in Town Street Park.

59:58.547 --> 01:00:02.000
The victim, who's body
had been partially eaten,

01:00:02.035 --> 01:00:04.609
was identified as
a local drug dealer.

01:00:04.988 --> 01:00:07.289
Take a bite out of crime.

01:00:07.528 --> 01:00:10.769
Maybe it's time we went
to the police.

01:00:11.104 --> 01:00:13.214
And tell them what?

01:00:13.249 --> 01:00:17.069
That Charles was making monsters
at the farmhouse?

01:00:17.469 --> 01:00:19.910
No, I don't want to see you
spend the rest of your life...

01:00:19.945 --> 01:00:23.131
being hounded by
a bunch of tabloid reporters.

01:00:23.165 --> 01:00:26.991
Someone should clear out the farmhouse and
destroy whatever Charles was working on.

01:00:27.111 --> 01:00:29.471
Blow it up, you own it.

01:00:29.991 --> 01:00:32.432
I know a guy who works for
a construction firm... Boom!

01:00:32.952 --> 01:00:36.952
Well maybe we will, but not before
we know what's down there.

01:00:50.457 --> 01:00:52.108
Alright.

01:00:52.207 --> 01:00:53.674
Let's do it.

01:00:55.274 --> 01:00:58.834
- Easy there, boss.
- Right, okay?

01:01:11.756 --> 01:01:13.991
Since when did you
start smoking again?

01:01:13.992 --> 01:01:16.238
Since I quit.

01:01:19.077 --> 01:01:21.269
You really gonna let her
go down there with us?

01:01:21.304 --> 01:01:24.217
I don't know, got any ideas
on how we can stop her?

01:01:24.252 --> 01:01:27.038
Hey, you're the man. Just tell her
she can't come with us.

01:01:27.074 --> 01:01:29.319
Right, well you tell her.

01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:41.844
What?
What's up? Huh?

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:45.880
Nothing. Nothing. I just thought I, erm...
Thought I saw something, that's all.

01:01:58.882 --> 01:02:01.803
What do you think you saw?

01:02:03.122 --> 01:02:05.763
Nothing. I'm just tired, you know.

01:02:15.584 --> 01:02:17.213
Claire...

01:02:17.248 --> 01:02:19.865
I don't think it's such a hot idea
for you to come along on this.

01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:22.565
You can't stop me.

01:02:24.185 --> 01:02:25.606
This is it?

01:02:25.607 --> 01:02:29.266
There are enough explosives in there
to give Mount Rushmore a headache.

01:02:37.166 --> 01:02:38.846
Okay, let's do it.

01:03:00.569 --> 01:03:03.090
- Cellar?
- Its there.

01:03:07.371 --> 01:03:09.331
Can I have a flashlight, please?

01:03:14.572 --> 01:03:17.812
Let's go. Watch this,
this is steep in here.

01:03:27.293 --> 01:03:29.294
Light switch is here.

01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:47.531
- What are we looking for?
- Some sort of access down.

01:03:52.937 --> 01:03:54.757
I don't see shit, boss.

01:03:59.757 --> 01:04:01.618
What's that?

01:04:10.038 --> 01:04:12.379
This thing moves, John.

01:04:14.079 --> 01:04:18.020
This end.
Just pull. Gimme a hand.

01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:31.261
Curiouser and curiouser.

01:04:36.422 --> 01:04:38.861
- Jesus!
- Oh, my God!

01:04:48.063 --> 01:04:50.643
Smells like Charles' experiments.

01:04:50.679 --> 01:04:53.044
Stark descent...

01:04:56.144 --> 01:04:57.784
Gentlemen...

01:04:59.305 --> 01:05:01.425
Boss...

01:05:05.566 --> 01:05:07.386
Easy, easy...

01:05:26.808 --> 01:05:29.948
Claire, be very careful,
it's slippery.

01:05:46.550 --> 01:05:48.631
Where's that light?

01:05:50.431 --> 01:05:51.931
Thank you!

01:05:52.011 --> 01:05:53.427
Throw me the flashlight.

01:05:53.461 --> 01:05:56.032
You know, we really could
have used two of these.

01:05:56.512 --> 01:05:59.872
Hey, it's not getting any lighter
down here. Come on, drop it.

01:06:04.912 --> 01:06:07.033
- Ok?
- Right. Now come on down.

01:06:20.215 --> 01:06:23.407
Hand me the shotgun
when you get to me.

01:06:24.944 --> 01:06:26.416
Ok. Got it?

01:06:26.495 --> 01:06:27.956
I think so.

01:06:37.117 --> 01:06:39.157
All right, here's your gun.

01:06:46.138 --> 01:06:48.498
Guess we're going down.

01:06:53.039 --> 01:06:54.979
Watch your head here.

01:07:44.126 --> 01:07:46.465
This is unbelievable.

01:07:48.086 --> 01:07:50.926
Great, a lantern. Lonnie,
Lonnie, get me a light.

01:07:52.366 --> 01:07:54.506
Here, hold this.

01:07:57.847 --> 01:08:00.527
Stick it up here.

01:08:16.448 --> 01:08:18.042
Any preference?

01:08:18.078 --> 01:08:20.411
Left's my lucky side.

01:08:31.751 --> 01:08:33.783
The river?

01:08:34.118 --> 01:08:36.433
Ezra's door.

01:08:38.872 --> 01:08:41.752
So I guess we're going
the other way, huh?

01:09:00.215 --> 01:09:04.055
- Watch it, it's slick.
- You be careful.

01:09:04.435 --> 01:09:06.215
Here's a door.

01:09:14.596 --> 01:09:16.456
Another one, here.

01:09:26.837 --> 01:09:29.098
They all must be sealed.

01:09:38.439 --> 01:09:40.198
Get back!

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:44.300
What is it with this place, is it coming
down around our ears, or what?

01:09:45.937 --> 01:09:49.938
It's been here 200, it'll probably be here
another couple of hours. Come on, let's go.

01:09:57.143 --> 01:09:58.742
You go on ahead.

01:10:06.563 --> 01:10:09.423
Hey, Lonnie, give me a hand here,
let's knock this down.

01:10:13.564 --> 01:10:16.604
Let's knock this son-of-a-bitch down,
come on. 1, 2, 3...

01:10:34.307 --> 01:10:36.151
John?

01:10:36.987 --> 01:10:38.688
John!

01:10:59.489 --> 01:11:01.450
What the..?

01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:03.150
My God!

01:11:16.352 --> 01:11:18.392
Holy shit!

01:11:41.016 --> 01:11:42.934
Look at this.

01:11:56.197 --> 01:11:58.237
Oh, shit...

01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:25.520
What d'ya got?

01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:30.661
Journal and notes of Joseph Curwen.
Gentleman of Pawtuxet plantation.

01:12:35.641 --> 01:12:40.642
To him who shall come after, and how
he may get beyond Time and ye Spheres.

01:12:42.202 --> 01:12:43.603
What does that mean?

01:12:51.644 --> 01:12:56.644
August the 4th: I am no longer a slave
to history and to time.

01:12:58.244 --> 01:13:02.065
I have finally conquered
the last extremity - Death

01:13:02.066 --> 01:13:06.067
Very large quantities of meat
and blood are required.

01:13:07.186 --> 01:13:11.187
however, everything depends
on the completeness of remains.

01:13:13.302 --> 01:13:18.291
No part must be missing if
the finest effects are to be had,

01:13:18.624 --> 01:13:22.857
for there is not but...
liveliest awfulness

01:13:23.058 --> 01:13:26.060
at what came up
from imperfect salts.

01:13:29.869 --> 01:13:35.682
Refluxing the elixir in the
alembic had proven the way.

01:13:35.749 --> 01:13:39.597
The success depending on
the control of the fire.

01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:47.325
Beware the marriage of
the flesh, for that...

01:13:47.359 --> 01:13:49.773
which is taken hath a
desire of it's own return,

01:13:49.786 --> 01:13:52.359
even if it be sucked from
the Operators very bones.

01:13:56.291 --> 01:14:01.192
When suddenly the skeleton
is reconstituted, the Operator...

01:14:01.426 --> 01:14:04.081
is pulled asunder as the
flesh useth to restore

01:14:04.094 --> 01:14:06.427
himself returneth to
it's rightful owner.

01:14:09.473 --> 01:14:11.774
What's he talking about?

01:14:12.433 --> 01:14:16.194
He's talking about bringing people
back from the dead.

01:14:16.374 --> 01:14:19.734
John. That's fuckin' insane!

01:14:25.054 --> 01:14:26.815
ballpoint?

01:14:29.135 --> 01:14:31.936
At last the method is learnt.

01:14:34.096 --> 01:14:36.696
Shit, John, you don't believe this, do ya?

01:15:15.302 --> 01:15:16.862
What are these urns?

01:15:23.662 --> 01:15:26.499
Honorius the I,

01:15:26.534 --> 01:15:29.176
Cosimo Rubieri,

01:15:29.211 --> 01:15:31.648
Robert Flud,

01:15:31.682 --> 01:15:34.046
Nicolas Flamel

01:15:41.744 --> 01:15:43.464
What is that shit?

01:15:47.185 --> 01:15:49.386
Human remains.

01:15:53.446 --> 01:15:55.512
That bastard wanted to live forever,

01:15:55.513 --> 01:15:57.827
and this is his immortality lab.

01:15:57.866 --> 01:15:59.466
Yeah, right.

01:15:59.807 --> 01:16:02.359
Don't you understand what's
going on down here, Lonnie?

01:16:02.394 --> 01:16:04.289
He beat death!

01:16:09.288 --> 01:16:11.568
Look, you know what that means? Huh?

01:16:18.449 --> 01:16:20.670
Let's see how it works.

01:16:32.431 --> 01:16:34.911
- Hey, wait a minute.
- John...

01:16:38.232 --> 01:16:40.292
Just a pinch...

01:17:15.898 --> 01:17:16.798
Now you're shitting me.

01:17:32.219 --> 01:17:34.214
That's it then.

01:17:35.241 --> 01:17:37.200
Its real.

01:17:39.819 --> 01:17:42.680
Let's see what else this
place has to offer.

01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:48.101
Come on, Lonnie.

01:17:53.121 --> 01:17:54.361
Oh, shit!

01:18:22.985 --> 01:18:25.064
What's this place?

01:18:30.466 --> 01:18:32.966
You okay?

01:18:33.005 --> 01:18:34.806
Sure?

01:18:57.630 --> 01:18:59.350
What's that?

01:18:59.929 --> 01:19:02.209
Anybody know Latin?

01:19:10.251 --> 01:19:12.570
Who built this place?

01:19:13.251 --> 01:19:15.271
Slave labor?

01:20:08.719 --> 01:20:10.479
Oh, God!

01:20:11.959 --> 01:20:14.498
Mistakes and screw-ups.

01:20:18.319 --> 01:20:20.279
- Ready to leave yet?
- Yes

01:20:20.314 --> 01:20:21.939
Come on.

01:20:39.961 --> 01:20:41.342
Don't move!

01:20:41.522 --> 01:20:43.359
- Lonnie, Lonnie!
- I'm lookin', where are they,

01:20:43.393 --> 01:20:45.263
Where the fuck are they?

01:20:45.943 --> 01:20:48.023
- John?
- Where are you?

01:20:48.043 --> 01:20:49.303
Over here.

01:20:49.338 --> 01:20:51.364
Lonnie, Lonnie, your matches!

01:20:54.603 --> 01:20:57.004
- Claire?
- This way.

01:20:59.164 --> 01:21:00.725
Just watch your step.

01:21:02.685 --> 01:21:06.218
Jesus! John!
Oh, God!

01:21:06.425 --> 01:21:08.445
- Gotcha, come on.
- Pull me up!

01:21:11.726 --> 01:21:14.127
My leg. My leg!

01:21:17.886 --> 01:21:20.020
Lonnie!

01:21:24.207 --> 01:21:25.828
The matches, Claire.

01:21:25.867 --> 01:21:27.327
Light another one.

01:21:30.108 --> 01:21:31.569
Damit!

01:21:36.457 --> 01:21:38.689
C'mon, come on!

01:22:28.736 --> 01:22:31.275
Claire, hang in there.

01:22:36.037 --> 01:22:37.677
Oh, no!

01:22:41.117 --> 01:22:43.037
What about Lonnie?

01:22:43.158 --> 01:22:45.278
There's nothing we can do.

01:23:23.444 --> 01:23:25.123
Wait...

01:23:25.758 --> 01:23:27.943
That's Charles' suitcase.

01:23:27.978 --> 01:23:29.603
Better bring it.

01:23:34.704 --> 01:23:36.323
It's following us.

01:23:36.358 --> 01:23:39.125
- Come on, John.
- God damit!

01:23:41.564 --> 01:23:44.284
- Wait.
- Okay.

01:23:44.625 --> 01:23:46.145
Let's go! Please.

01:23:58.787 --> 01:24:01.447
Okay. Come on.

01:25:24.137 --> 01:25:26.899
She has a mild concussion.
She may not remember much.

01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:29.421
Well hopefully she won't
remember anything.

01:25:31.263 --> 01:25:33.265
Did you know she's pregnant?

01:27:48.847 --> 01:27:50.688
Thanks Dave, I'll call you if I need you.

01:27:51.490 --> 01:27:53.771
I won't hear ya, you'll
have to hit this button.

01:28:07.461 --> 01:28:09.063
Do you recognize this?

01:28:09.623 --> 01:28:11.624
My memories not as it should be.

01:28:12.306 --> 01:28:15.828
The doctors here say
I suffered severe depression.

01:28:18.991 --> 01:28:21.072
But you and I know differently, don't we?

01:28:22.994 --> 01:28:26.996
See your problem is, you're not even
Charles Dexter Ward, are you?

01:28:28.857 --> 01:28:31.719
No... You're just plain old Curwen.

01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:36.323
- Superstition.
- Impersonation. Murder.

01:28:37.645 --> 01:28:39.925
You know nothing.

01:28:41.727 --> 01:28:43.368
I know plenty.

01:28:43.388 --> 01:28:46.251
See, I just just got back
from your catacombs.

01:28:49.734 --> 01:28:53.497
And how fares my domain?

01:28:54.356 --> 01:28:56.338
I blew it up.

01:28:58.079 --> 01:29:02.083
Afraid so. I blew the shit out of it.

01:29:02.924 --> 01:29:06.927
And if you ever want to go home again,
you're gonna have to do it with a shovel.

01:29:09.189 --> 01:29:12.231
Now this, is Charles.

01:29:14.632 --> 01:29:16.143
And the way I see it, nobody,

01:29:16.178 --> 01:29:19.837
and I mean, nobody, is ever
gonna let you out of here.

01:29:22.558 --> 01:29:27.061
Mr. March. Let me put you a question.

01:29:30.079 --> 01:29:32.917
Suppose you were a
physician, or a constable

01:29:32.930 --> 01:29:35.083
and someone came
to you and said;

01:29:36.153 --> 01:29:40.157
Charles Ward isn't really Charles Ward
at all. He's really Joseph Curwen...

01:29:40.441 --> 01:29:44.444
who is 250 years old and
looks exactly like him

01:29:47.057 --> 01:29:49.178
What would you say?

01:29:52.761 --> 01:29:54.982
Take my point.

01:29:56.664 --> 01:29:59.187
I don't give a rats ass.

01:30:00.788 --> 01:30:03.310
You killed Charles, didn't you?

01:30:04.610 --> 01:30:08.614
Young master Charles
was a headstrong lad.

01:30:10.675 --> 01:30:14.678
Inquisitive but... principled.

01:30:17.220 --> 01:30:20.242
It was he who raised me up, you know?

01:30:22.383 --> 01:30:24.605
As planned...

01:30:25.246 --> 01:30:28.642
Knowing my demise, imminent,

01:30:28.677 --> 01:30:31.915
I paid handsomely,
the local undertaker.

01:30:31.950 --> 01:30:35.953
Thus ensuring my remains
to be properly preserved.

01:31:43.526 --> 01:31:47.827
Course, you couldn't go
around together, could ya?

01:31:47.828 --> 01:31:49.853
Would've raised eyebrows.

01:31:50.230 --> 01:31:55.735
Indeed. And so the inestimable
physician was born... Dr. Ash.

01:32:12.168 --> 01:32:16.371
A most clever creation, don't you agree?

01:32:17.972 --> 01:32:21.451
And he sneaked you
out of the house back then.

01:32:22.386 --> 01:32:24.610
It would have been better for me
to make an appearance as some...

01:32:24.611 --> 01:32:28.615
kinsman from afar, but young
master Charles would not have it.

01:32:30.662 --> 01:32:33.784
He developed qualms...

01:32:37.226 --> 01:32:41.229
Charles and I soon disagreed
on the disposition of flesh.

01:32:44.872 --> 01:32:46.774
His, specifically.

01:32:48.275 --> 01:32:52.279
Charles simply couldn't reconcile himself
to the resurrective hunger.

01:32:57.082 --> 01:32:59.803
Give me the satisfaction of some answers...

01:33:00.924 --> 01:33:06.109
- What are you doing?
- You are the detective, Mr. March.

01:33:06.669 --> 01:33:08.310
What do you think?

01:33:13.013 --> 01:33:17.016
I think you've found a way
to live forever. But it's messy.

01:33:20.659 --> 01:33:23.262
That is just the beginning.

01:33:24.942 --> 01:33:28.946
I have struck depths that your
little brain cannot fathom.

01:33:30.682 --> 01:33:34.549
My researches has led me
far beyond eternity.

01:33:34.650 --> 01:33:38.153
I have drawn down
demons from the stars.

01:33:38.273 --> 01:33:41.252
I have harnessed the shadows that stride...

01:33:41.253 --> 01:33:45.257
from world to world, to sow
Death and Madness

01:33:46.374 --> 01:33:49.201
I have designs whereby the earth,

01:33:49.202 --> 01:33:53.204
nay, the very stars themselves
can move at my command.

01:33:54.105 --> 01:33:58.108
Time and Cosmos belong
to me, Mr. March.

01:34:00.229 --> 01:34:02.778
The destinies of all things,

01:34:02.779 --> 01:34:08.697
living and dead, are mine.

01:34:13.539 --> 01:34:16.907
But, as you say, it is messy.

01:34:19.324 --> 01:34:24.464
Truly, the curse of the
formerly dead, is the hunger.

01:34:26.208 --> 01:34:30.613
And it will not be denied.

01:34:59.956 --> 01:35:04.057
Much... better

01:35:04.959 --> 01:35:07.424
Are you trembling?

01:35:07.459 --> 01:35:11.462
Oh, there'll be no point in that.
There'll be no salvation for thee.

01:35:14.506 --> 01:35:17.220
For you see, Mr. March.

01:35:17.745 --> 01:35:21.748
May I call you John?
I feel that I know you.

01:35:22.792 --> 01:35:26.796
Strong as my hunger
for knowledge may be

01:35:26.885 --> 01:35:30.519
my hunger for food is so much stronger.

01:35:32.119 --> 01:35:33.319
Hey!

01:36:19.054 --> 01:36:21.597
And as for thee...

01:36:22.417 --> 01:36:26.421
I shall strip thy flesh from
thy bones like a suckling pig.

01:36:28.203 --> 01:36:32.206
But because I'm a madman,
they will do nothing to me.

01:36:33.946 --> 01:36:37.949
Such are the customs of
this enlightened century.

01:36:39.010 --> 01:36:43.013
Then, in due time, and under the
guidance of the learned Dr. Waite,

01:36:44.111 --> 01:36:46.897
I shall make a full recovery,

01:36:46.977 --> 01:36:49.258
and win my release.

01:36:50.279 --> 01:36:54.282
Mrs. Ward will be pleased. Yes?

01:36:55.341 --> 01:36:58.706
Especially when my teeth are fixed.

01:37:20.122 --> 01:37:21.733
So, you have the Reflux?

01:37:21.834 --> 01:37:24.359
And what will you do
with that, little man?

01:37:52.746 --> 01:37:55.148
Corwen...

01:40:37.912 --> 01:40:40.435
Now the whole story is down on tape

01:40:40.471 --> 01:40:43.277
just in case the police ever get curious.

01:40:43.396 --> 01:40:46.198
I'm guessing they'll buy my version.

01:40:48.979 --> 01:40:51.022
How's he doin'?

01:40:53.984 --> 01:40:57.126
Resting quietly.

01:40:57.707 --> 01:41:01.149
There was nothing I could do
for Lonnie, or the orderly.

01:41:01.284 --> 01:41:03.712
But there was something
I could do for Claire.

01:41:04.032 --> 01:41:08.090
I made it look like Charles had escaped.
I wanted to spare her the truth.

01:41:09.055 --> 01:41:12.110
The truth...
Whatever that means.
