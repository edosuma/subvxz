[Lady Whistledown]
Dearest gentle reader, it is often said

01:41.309 --> 01:45.063
that those who marry in haste
must repent at leisure,

01:45.146 --> 01:49.150
a sentiment that is clearly shared
by Miss Daphne Bridgerton,

01:49.234 --> 01:52.612
who has apparently rejected
not one, not two,

01:52.695 --> 01:55.949
but three proposals already this week.

01:56.616 --> 02:01.162
Some believe she is showing admirable
forethought in her deliberations,

02:01.663 --> 02:05.083
but I would venture
a different conjecture,

02:05.166 --> 02:07.085
that she, like this author,

02:07.168 --> 02:10.505
is still waiting
on the only suitor of note.

02:15.718 --> 02:17.303
Here we are.

02:20.348 --> 02:22.308
[Daphne] Our plan has worked thus far,

02:22.392 --> 02:25.270
but we must continue our ruse
until I have found my match.

02:25.353 --> 02:28.189
In the grand battle of the season,
I am your trusted general,

02:28.273 --> 02:29.274
marshaling the troops.

02:29.357 --> 02:32.360
Wellington could only hope
for a soldier so brave.

02:32.443 --> 02:34.988
And handsome. You must not forget that.

02:35.071 --> 02:36.156
[laughs]

02:45.039 --> 02:46.541
[horse whinnies]

02:46.624 --> 02:48.042
[postman] Post has arrived!

02:54.424 --> 02:56.718
-Some prince is coming to London.
-[Philippa gasps]

02:56.801 --> 02:59.429
Then I shall wear
my most brilliant dress of all.

02:59.512 --> 03:01.097
Something must hold his interest,

03:01.181 --> 03:03.057
as it will certainly not be
your conversation.

03:03.141 --> 03:04.309
[both chuckle]

03:15.653 --> 03:16.613
[Penelope sighs]

03:23.203 --> 03:24.037
Anything?

03:28.958 --> 03:30.043
[door closes]

03:31.002 --> 03:34.047
How long does it take
for a letter to arrive from Spain?

03:34.756 --> 03:36.591
Sir George is with the front line.

03:36.674 --> 03:38.635
It must be difficult
to get letters in and out.

03:38.718 --> 03:40.303
You must be patient.

03:40.386 --> 03:43.348
If your love is as great
as your previous letters state,

03:43.431 --> 03:46.935
surely he will write back to you soon.
Or perhaps, even better,

03:47.018 --> 03:48.937
he's already making his way
back to you here

03:49.020 --> 03:50.271
to come and take you home.

03:52.106 --> 03:53.566
Penelope Featherington!

03:53.650 --> 03:56.486
What did I tell you
about cavorting with the expectant?

03:56.569 --> 03:58.780
-Marina has been in here for ages, Mama!
-Out. Out.

03:58.863 --> 04:00.114
-[Penelope moans]
-Out!

04:02.617 --> 04:04.869
-[Featherington sighs]
-You cannot hide me away forever.

04:04.953 --> 04:06.204
No, I cannot,

04:06.287 --> 04:10.792
which is why you are to reenter society
at once and find yourself a husband.

04:11.417 --> 04:14.087
-I do not want--
-What you want became immaterial long ago.

04:14.170 --> 04:16.673
You shall wed,
and you shall do it as soon as possible.

04:16.756 --> 04:18.299
You are to be fitted for a new wardrobe.

04:18.383 --> 04:21.010
It's about time you dressed
in the family colors anyway.

04:28.017 --> 04:30.019
Daphne, have you thought about

04:30.103 --> 04:32.397
with whom you would like to dance
at tonight's ball?

04:32.480 --> 04:33.773
I have some ideas.

04:33.856 --> 04:35.900
Lord Weaver is a fine dancer.

04:36.484 --> 04:39.696
Lord Hardy was asking about you
at White's last night.

04:39.779 --> 04:41.990
Lord Hardy? What about the duke?

04:42.073 --> 04:44.951
The duke has not proposed, Mama.

04:45.702 --> 04:48.663
-I am still considering my best course.
-Wise girl.

04:48.746 --> 04:51.082
And Lord Hardy is a fine option.

04:51.165 --> 04:53.334
Although, he is rather boastful.

04:53.418 --> 04:56.296
[Viola] My dear,
why ever do you complicate matters so?

04:56.379 --> 04:59.674
You must simply marry the man
who feels like your dearest friend.

04:59.757 --> 05:02.802
Is that it, Mama?
Well, how very simple indeed!

05:02.885 --> 05:04.846
Yes, quite. [chuckles ironically]

05:07.015 --> 05:10.601
[string quartet plays]

05:12.020 --> 05:14.022
[guests chattering]

05:25.700 --> 05:26.743
[parrot squawks]

05:28.911 --> 05:29.954
[Daphne laughs]

05:34.292 --> 05:37.295
-Is my general ready for battle?
-I was born ready.

05:37.378 --> 05:38.546
[Daphne chuckles]

05:38.629 --> 05:41.632
Were that true, I suspect
you would need less protection

05:41.716 --> 05:44.510
from our beloved packs of ambitious mamas.

05:44.594 --> 05:47.347
You call me the general,
yet you are the first to draw blood.

05:49.182 --> 05:51.100
[Daphne laughs]

05:51.184 --> 05:52.226
Miss Bridgerton.

05:52.310 --> 05:53.686
Lord Weaver.

05:55.355 --> 05:58.858
I was wondering if you might
do me the honor of a dance tonight.

06:03.488 --> 06:05.323
[loudly] Must I share your attention

06:05.406 --> 06:07.784
with every moon-eyed dandy,
Miss Bridgerton?

06:07.867 --> 06:09.702
Only the charming ones, Your Grace.

06:12.997 --> 06:15.249
The perfect jealous suitor. Well done!

06:15.333 --> 06:17.502
Someone is angling
for a promotion in rank.

06:21.255 --> 06:23.257
[music continues]

06:26.135 --> 06:30.515
So, tell me, my lord,
do you prefer the city or the country?

06:31.933 --> 06:33.768
I suppose I've never thought of it.

06:34.852 --> 06:36.646
I am partial to the country,

06:37.313 --> 06:39.732
but there are certainly advantages
to both.

06:41.692 --> 06:43.569
Where do you see yourself settling?

06:44.362 --> 06:46.114
Another excellent question.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.369
You look bewitching tonight,
Miss Bridgerton.

06:51.452 --> 06:54.497
Well, I do hope you are not too spellbound
to chat, Lord Hardy.

06:54.580 --> 06:57.125
Did you know I purchased
my first landau when I left Oxford?

06:57.208 --> 06:59.210
I have acquired two more since.

06:59.293 --> 07:01.337
I keep them at my ancestral home.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.673
My ancestral home is really quite large,

07:03.756 --> 07:05.967
much larger than most others in the area.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.429
Fascinating.

07:12.598 --> 07:14.767
My family and I are exceptionally close.

07:15.518 --> 07:17.937
How wonderful, Lord Tompkins.

07:18.604 --> 07:20.565
I am quite the same with my own.

07:20.648 --> 07:22.024
After I marry, in fact,

07:22.108 --> 07:24.819
my mother will reside
with me and my new bride.

07:25.820 --> 07:28.573
And does your father have
anything to say about that?

07:29.157 --> 07:31.367
I should think so. It was his idea.

07:37.206 --> 07:38.624
[Violet] Not much of a pair.

07:38.708 --> 07:41.502
I should think not.
She and the duke are a love match.

07:41.586 --> 07:44.589
Nonetheless, you must remind the duke
to actually propose.

07:47.383 --> 07:49.886
I would not worry, Lady Bridgerton.
Look at them.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.013
They are clearly attached.

07:52.096 --> 07:54.557
And how did you find
our eligible bachelors?

07:54.640 --> 07:56.434
[sighs] I must confess,

07:56.517 --> 07:59.562
I have felt more chemistry
when being fitted at the modiste.

07:59.645 --> 08:01.689
-[man 1] Your Majesty.
-[man 2] Your Majesty.

08:03.608 --> 08:04.609
[woman] Your Majesty.

08:04.692 --> 08:08.446
The prince is from Prussia,
and I dare say that I just caught his eye.

08:08.529 --> 08:11.365
[exclaims] I love Russia. I could swoon.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.702
-[Daphne] They do not even know him.
-[Simon] They do not need to.

08:14.785 --> 08:16.412
Besides the fact he is a prince.

08:16.496 --> 08:19.290
Surely you cannot be surprised.
You know how this works.

08:19.373 --> 08:21.584
Was it not you
who wrote the book on the very subject?

08:21.667 --> 08:23.628
[both chuckle]

08:25.630 --> 08:27.423
Watch as Miss Cowper lowers her eyes.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.509
-[Simon] Mm.
-[Daphne] Oh, so demure.

08:29.592 --> 08:32.720
Now she will look up at him,
ever so quickly,

08:32.803 --> 08:36.224
and then allow her fan
to slowly sweep across her bosom

08:36.307 --> 08:38.518
before casting her eyes
back upon the ground,

08:38.601 --> 08:39.769
for one is much too timid

08:39.852 --> 08:42.772
to ever meet His Royal Highness's
piercing gaze, of course.

08:42.855 --> 08:44.440
[both chuckle]

08:45.233 --> 08:46.943
Oh, now he will kiss her hand.

08:47.026 --> 08:49.278
[Simon] Forever charmed by her submission.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.655
Precisely.

08:51.739 --> 08:54.700
Should I ever need assistance
drafting an addendum to my book,

08:54.784 --> 08:56.202
I shall know who to ask.

08:56.953 --> 09:01.165
[Simon] I do believe he just told
Miss Cowper that her gown is exquisite.

09:01.249 --> 09:02.708
Do you think so?

09:02.792 --> 09:05.127
He is here
to tell every lady the very same thing.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.045
[Daphne] Mm.

09:09.006 --> 09:13.052
Prince Friedrich, this is
the young lady I was telling you about,

09:13.135 --> 09:14.679
the season's diamond.

09:16.722 --> 09:18.683
So lovely to meet you, Miss Bridgerton.

09:18.766 --> 09:20.810
Your gown, it is exquisite.

09:20.893 --> 09:22.812
[laughs, snorts]

09:23.354 --> 09:24.397
[chuckles]

09:24.480 --> 09:26.148
[Daphne snorts, laughs]

09:28.276 --> 09:29.318
My apologies.

09:30.236 --> 09:31.571
No apology necessary.

09:32.572 --> 09:33.823
Perhaps a small one.

09:37.827 --> 09:39.412
That was entirely your fault.

09:39.495 --> 09:42.331
How does one manage to make such
an unbecoming sound while laughing?

09:42.915 --> 09:44.083
[Daphne snorts, laughs]

09:44.166 --> 09:45.126
[both laughing]

09:45.209 --> 09:46.502
Now you are making it look easy.

09:48.713 --> 09:51.549
[clears throat]
Miss Bridgerton, might I have this dance?

09:51.632 --> 09:52.758
[Daphne clears throat]

10:02.059 --> 10:03.603
-Bonsoir.
-Thank you.

10:09.233 --> 10:10.610
[muffled clattering]

10:15.740 --> 10:16.741
Hello?

10:17.491 --> 10:19.118
The shop has closed.

10:22.913 --> 10:23.956
[relieved sigh]

10:24.457 --> 10:27.209
Bloody hell, Si!
You half scared me out of my wits!

10:27.293 --> 10:29.503
What?
I used the back entrance, as you asked.

10:29.587 --> 10:31.047
Heaven forbid someone discover

10:31.130 --> 10:34.216
you consort with the most notorious
opera singer in all of London.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.510
You are but third on that list.

10:37.928 --> 10:40.181
You know, you are always welcome here.

10:40.806 --> 10:43.976
I know you are used to finer comforts,
but stay as long as you need.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.019
You are a dear friend,

10:45.102 --> 10:48.189
but I shall find an arrangement
with another gentleman soon enough.

10:48.272 --> 10:50.232
Hopefully someone
less of an ass than your last.

10:52.068 --> 10:54.278
I know. We will not think of him.

10:54.362 --> 10:57.239
-This is beautiful work.
-For Lady Cowper's girl.

10:57.323 --> 10:59.492
Not that it will help her get an offer.

10:59.575 --> 11:02.828
Not even my finest silks
will compensate for that sneer.

11:04.330 --> 11:07.124
I could make you something
out of the same fabric.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.418
Perhaps for your performance next month.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.046
I should think it
an odd choice of color for me.

11:12.755 --> 11:15.341
I am no innocent debutante.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.885
And more's your good fortune.

11:18.844 --> 11:21.764
Would you prefer to sit around
simpering over your needlework

11:21.847 --> 11:25.476
or whatsoever it is these debutantes
must do to pass the time?

11:26.227 --> 11:30.064
-You and I make our own way in the world.
-That we do.

11:30.564 --> 11:34.443
Which is why I shall find myself
a wealthy, sensible gentleman

11:34.527 --> 11:37.530
to keep me in high fashion,
one who will never break his word.

11:37.613 --> 11:40.658
Or prevent you from running up
vast accounts at your beloved modiste.

11:40.741 --> 11:43.953
Or run home every time
his mother or sisters have need.

11:44.036 --> 11:47.581
[laughs] And where might you find
such a paragon of dishonor?

11:48.624 --> 11:52.169
-[dice rattling]
-[Anthony] Here we go. Come on.

11:52.253 --> 11:54.255
-[man laughing]
-Me again.

11:54.338 --> 11:55.214
Indeed.

11:55.297 --> 11:58.592
I am inclined to investigate
the provenance of such lucky dice.

11:58.676 --> 12:00.928
They did not land the same way
when you were casting.

12:01.011 --> 12:04.014
Perhaps the common element is you.
Might it be best to show some restraint?

12:04.098 --> 12:06.183
Restraint is not among
Lord Featherington's skills.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.185
Well, then, neither is gambling.

12:08.936 --> 12:10.062
[Anthony laughs]

12:10.604 --> 12:13.023
-I seem to have done it, Bridgerton.
-Done what?

12:14.316 --> 12:16.652
Proved you remain capable
of laughing again in my presence.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.572
You cannot fault me
for being doubtful of your intentions.

12:19.655 --> 12:20.489
Indeed, I can.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.324
For all the mischief
you've witnessed me make,

12:22.408 --> 12:24.785
you'd also know
I would never make a fool of a lady,

12:24.869 --> 12:26.537
and certainly not one such as your sister.

12:26.620 --> 12:27.538
You confound me.

12:27.621 --> 12:30.833
You are respectful, and yet I know
you have no intention of marriage.

12:30.916 --> 12:32.668
-Has that changed?
-I cannot claim so.

12:32.752 --> 12:36.088
-Then what could your intentions be?
-Respectful. Might we leave it there?

12:37.798 --> 12:40.342
[crowd applauding]

12:43.763 --> 12:44.722
[Simon laughs]

12:46.140 --> 12:47.683
[crowd chattering]

12:49.852 --> 12:50.895
If you will excuse me.

12:55.608 --> 12:56.525
Excuse me.

12:57.234 --> 12:58.444
Ooh!

13:01.864 --> 13:05.451
You look exceedingly familiar to me,
my lord.

13:06.035 --> 13:07.453
Or is it "Your Grace"?

13:08.287 --> 13:09.371
I am afraid it is.

13:09.955 --> 13:12.958
Might I have seen you at the opera?
I perform there.

13:13.042 --> 13:14.460
-Do you?
-Mm.

13:14.543 --> 13:18.297
I have often wondered what plays
in one's mind when an aria is performed.

13:18.380 --> 13:20.466
Sometimes I think
on the meaning of the words I sing.

13:20.549 --> 13:24.762
At other times, I think of all the tasks
I have failed to accomplish during my day.

13:24.845 --> 13:29.225
And sometimes I ponder my plans
for after my performance.

13:30.643 --> 13:34.772
Might I entice you to take in
one of my performances sometime soon?

13:35.981 --> 13:37.399
Perhaps tomorrow night?

13:44.698 --> 13:47.368
[frustrated sigh]

14:06.053 --> 14:08.264
Sister? Whatever are you doing?

14:09.473 --> 14:10.641
I could not sleep.

14:11.600 --> 14:14.061
I thought a bit of warm milk
might help matters.

14:14.144 --> 14:17.565
-Should I ring for a servant?
-No. No, do not wake them.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.318
Would you like to join me?

14:27.741 --> 14:29.952
-We should light it.
-Excellent idea.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.163
[Daphne] Well, go on.

14:34.081 --> 14:34.915
Me?

14:35.791 --> 14:38.586
-I should not know how to do it.
-And you believe I should?

14:44.967 --> 14:46.218
Cold milk, then.

14:46.302 --> 14:48.095
Most refreshing, given the heat.

14:52.600 --> 14:53.475
[Daphne] Mm.

14:53.559 --> 14:56.061
Can I ask you a question, Brother?

14:56.145 --> 14:59.398
So long as it has nothing to do
with the inner workings of that thing.

14:59.481 --> 15:00.399
[both chuckle]

15:02.151 --> 15:03.360
It is about the duke.

15:05.362 --> 15:06.280
What about the duke?

15:07.281 --> 15:10.409
Well-- Do you know the reason
he is so opposed to marriage?

15:10.492 --> 15:12.703
-Daph…
-He is your closest friend.

15:12.786 --> 15:14.914
Surely you must know things.

15:14.997 --> 15:17.541
The things I know
are certainly not for your ears.

15:20.669 --> 15:21.670
[scoffs]

15:22.296 --> 15:25.049
How foolish of me
to ever even wonder about such things.

15:28.510 --> 15:29.887
He barely knew his father.

15:31.805 --> 15:33.015
Never knew his mother.

15:34.433 --> 15:35.809
Not one sibling.

15:39.229 --> 15:40.856
The duke grew up…

15:41.523 --> 15:43.150
quite differently than us, Daph.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.196
In all the 20 years I have known him,

15:47.279 --> 15:49.448
he has not mentioned
his so-called family even once.

15:50.115 --> 15:51.951
He has spent his entire life alone.

15:54.453 --> 15:55.496
How very sad.

15:55.579 --> 15:57.164
He prefers it that way.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.669
You must not concern yourself
with his troubles.

16:02.544 --> 16:05.339
You must simply know
some people are not meant to be together…

16:06.590 --> 16:07.549
no matter…

16:08.509 --> 16:10.302
how much we might wish otherwise.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.057
I see.

16:19.895 --> 16:20.813
Very well.

16:23.357 --> 16:25.484
Thank you, Brother, for the milk.

16:26.735 --> 16:28.779
We will have to do this again sometime.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.076
[Lady Whistledown] I have always thought

16:34.159 --> 16:40.207
that an appreciation of the arts
is what lifts us beyond mere animals.

16:40.833 --> 16:44.586
It stirs the passions
and moves the spirit,

16:45.462 --> 16:50.217
and, this author hopes,
inspires more newsworthy pursuits.

16:50.968 --> 16:55.389
A new wing at Somerset House
is to be opened today,

16:55.472 --> 16:58.308
where several attractions
will be on display…

16:59.268 --> 17:02.187
like the lovely Miss Marina Thompson,

17:02.271 --> 17:04.815
newly recovered
from her mysterious illness

17:05.399 --> 17:08.694
and expected to finally rejoin the season.

17:09.445 --> 17:10.404
[Genevieve] Oh!

17:10.487 --> 17:13.949
Mon Dieu!
Perhaps I took your measurements wrong.

17:14.992 --> 17:16.910
Miss Thompson has a fondness for cake.

17:16.994 --> 17:19.329
A reducing diet
will work wonders for her, I'm sure.

17:20.706 --> 17:21.623
Oui, madame.

17:23.083 --> 17:24.126
[Genevieve grunts]

17:30.007 --> 17:31.633
[guests chattering]

17:31.717 --> 17:36.305
[Lady Whistledown] Of course, there is
today's royal attraction as well,

17:36.805 --> 17:38.974
Prince Friedrich of Prussia.

17:39.725 --> 17:44.980
His Highness has come to our shores
in want of a fine Fräulein.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.732
Could this be the reason

17:46.815 --> 17:52.237
a certain language tutor has been seen
visiting Cowper House all week?

17:55.908 --> 17:57.910
[guest chatter continues]

18:08.754 --> 18:10.547
Miss Anna Vaughn.

18:10.631 --> 18:13.217
Speaks several languages, I hear.

18:15.469 --> 18:18.180
Miss Mary Egglesfield.
She's meant to be quite the reader.

18:18.263 --> 18:21.600
Were I looking for a list of debutantes
and their dubious accomplishments,

18:21.683 --> 18:24.103
I could have stayed home
and read Lady Whistledown.

18:24.728 --> 18:26.396
-That's enough from you.
-No, no, no.

18:26.897 --> 18:27.731
Colin.

18:29.441 --> 18:31.151
Quite dull, would you not agree?

18:31.235 --> 18:32.361
It is terribly familiar,

18:32.444 --> 18:34.863
yet I am sure
this is the first time I have seen it.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.657
That is because,
like all of these paintings,

18:36.740 --> 18:39.618
it was done by a man
who sees a woman as a decorative object.

18:39.701 --> 18:41.870
-They are like…
-Human vases.

18:43.497 --> 18:44.456
[mouthing] Help me.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.959
I think my mama is calling me.

18:48.085 --> 18:51.505
-She is busy with Miss Thompson.
-I will return shortly. Wait here.

18:52.422 --> 18:56.927
Lord Middlethorpe,
you simply must meet Miss Marina Thompson,

18:57.636 --> 18:59.429
a distant cousin of my husband's.

19:00.013 --> 19:02.641
-Miss Thompson, the pleasure is mine.
-Entirely.

19:02.724 --> 19:03.559
[Penelope] Marina…

19:03.642 --> 19:06.728
Penelope, allow us to view
some of the paintings over here.

19:06.812 --> 19:10.190
-I had a brief question to ask Marina.
-Now is not the time, Penelope.

19:10.274 --> 19:11.859
I believe now to be the perfect time.

19:11.942 --> 19:14.361
-Miss Thompson?
-I certainly was not addressing you.

19:18.365 --> 19:22.286
I do not believe
that I have ever met such a lovely girl

19:22.369 --> 19:24.705
with such an ugly countenance.

19:26.790 --> 19:28.584
You are a meddlesome little wench,

19:28.667 --> 19:31.128
and you clearly do not understand
the gravity of your situation.

19:31.211 --> 19:32.921
That will need to change.

19:34.423 --> 19:36.133
[chattering continues]

19:42.723 --> 19:44.183
It's much too cold.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.811
Where's any sense of the subject's spirit?

19:48.687 --> 19:49.521
And the light!

19:49.605 --> 19:50.772
Given the quality,

19:50.856 --> 19:54.276
I do wonder why the piece was not skyed
with the other daubs.

19:54.359 --> 19:56.153
Perhaps we should ask the artist.

19:56.236 --> 19:57.779
That would be something, Lady Danbury.

19:57.863 --> 20:00.282
Mm… Mr. Granville,

20:00.365 --> 20:02.743
why was your piece not skyed?

20:03.285 --> 20:04.870
-[Granville] Hmm.
-Mr. Granville, I--

20:04.953 --> 20:07.206
If you will excuse me,
um, I must find my wife.

20:07.289 --> 20:08.415
[Lady Danbury chuckling]

20:08.498 --> 20:11.793
You diabolical…
How could you let me rattle on like that?

20:11.877 --> 20:14.671
How could I not, my dear Mr. Bridgerton?

20:14.755 --> 20:17.674
It was riotously funny, you must admit.

20:31.438 --> 20:32.397
Miss Bridgerton.

20:34.608 --> 20:35.525
Your Highness.

20:35.609 --> 20:36.902
I was hoping to see you today.

20:37.819 --> 20:38.820
-Were you?
-Yes.

20:38.904 --> 20:42.157
It seems the art is not the only
beautiful thing on display at present.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.283
[Daphne chuckles]

20:43.867 --> 20:45.953
Are you enjoying your time here in London?

20:46.036 --> 20:47.663
It's always been
one of my favorite cities.

20:47.746 --> 20:50.832
How lovely to hear
from someone who has traveled so widely.

20:51.625 --> 20:52.834
Have you traveled much?

20:52.918 --> 20:56.338
I think you would love
the music of Vienna.

20:58.757 --> 20:59.591
Miss Bridgerton?

21:01.009 --> 21:01.969
[inhales sharply]

21:02.052 --> 21:04.179
You should make your rounds,
Your Highness.

21:04.680 --> 21:08.100
I believe there is a gaggle
of young ladies waiting for your favor.

21:08.642 --> 21:09.977
Delightful to see you.

21:22.864 --> 21:24.449
What are you doing, hiding away in here?

21:25.284 --> 21:26.702
Enjoying some culture.

21:28.662 --> 21:31.790
You are receiving glowing reviews
from Whistledown.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.086
-Did you see?
-I did. I ought to take to the stage.

21:36.169 --> 21:37.254
[Daphne chuckles]

21:38.422 --> 21:40.382
Is it awful that I'm enjoying it?

21:40.465 --> 21:42.092
My wild jealousy?

21:42.175 --> 21:43.927
Fooling Lady Whistledown.

21:45.137 --> 21:47.472
She knows everything about everyone,
even the queen,

21:47.556 --> 21:51.643
and yet we have her utterly convinced
that we are mad for each other.

21:51.727 --> 21:53.145
We are awfully clever.

21:53.228 --> 21:54.563
Indeed, we are.

21:55.856 --> 21:59.067
Excessive pride suits you,
Miss Bridgerton.

21:59.151 --> 22:01.778
[gasps theatrically]
Pride is a sin, Your Grace.

22:01.862 --> 22:03.739
One of the lesser sins. But do not worry.

22:04.364 --> 22:06.241
We must all start somewhere.

22:06.325 --> 22:09.286
You are not half as shocking
as you think you are.

22:12.581 --> 22:13.498
Oh…

22:14.624 --> 22:17.044
-This one is yours too.
-[Simon] You sound surprised.

22:17.127 --> 22:18.378
I suppose I am.

22:19.921 --> 22:22.257
It is not at all
like the others you donated, is it?

22:23.759 --> 22:24.718
It is not.

22:26.428 --> 22:27.512
The others are…

22:28.638 --> 22:30.140
Well, they were to my father's tastes.

22:31.600 --> 22:35.270
If Lady Danbury is to be believed,
this one was a favorite of my mother's.

22:36.980 --> 22:38.690
I have never understood why.

22:42.569 --> 22:43.945
It is very beautiful.

22:48.575 --> 22:52.079
It reminds me of waking up in the country.

22:54.873 --> 22:56.166
First thing in the morning,

22:56.958 --> 22:58.168
when I am all alone,

22:58.919 --> 23:01.546
and I have not yet spoken to a soul…

23:03.090 --> 23:05.384
I look outside the window, and it is…

23:07.052 --> 23:07.969
serene.

23:09.888 --> 23:13.183
As if I could be the only person left
in the world, and yet…

23:13.892 --> 23:15.644
somehow I am not lonely.

23:16.686 --> 23:19.356
I am comforted, at peace.

23:20.023 --> 23:23.068
The others are certainly
very grand and impressive,

23:23.151 --> 23:25.320
but this one…

23:27.155 --> 23:29.616
This one is intimate.

23:31.535 --> 23:33.912
[light piano music plays]

23:42.295 --> 23:43.422
[gasps lightly]

23:55.142 --> 23:56.476
[crowd gasps loudly]

24:02.524 --> 24:03.817
[crowd murmuring]

24:04.985 --> 24:06.194
What has happened?

24:06.278 --> 24:07.362
Cressida swooned.

24:07.446 --> 24:08.947
And Prince Friedrich caught her.

24:10.740 --> 24:13.034
-Water?
-[woman] Yes, water, please. Thank you.

24:13.702 --> 24:16.246
I dare say it was
the most romantic thing I've ever seen.

24:16.830 --> 24:17.956
Yes, thank you.

24:18.039 --> 24:20.667
A feigned swoon. Chapter six, I believe?

24:20.750 --> 24:23.211
-We ought to up our game.
-[both snicker]

24:25.464 --> 24:26.965
[Cressida gasps theatrically]

24:30.051 --> 24:31.553
-Thank you.
-Okay.

24:31.636 --> 24:33.180
[guests applaud lightly]

24:39.144 --> 24:41.521
Shall I set course
for the opera, Your Grace?

24:41.605 --> 24:44.357
We need to make haste
if you still plan to attend this evening.

24:45.567 --> 24:48.069
No. It will be
straight home tonight, instead.

25:04.211 --> 25:05.837
I shall be locking up now, miss.

25:06.755 --> 25:09.216
Are you sure there are
no gentlemen lingering about the gallery?

25:12.385 --> 25:15.013
[Lady Whistledown]
These days, the modern young lady

25:15.096 --> 25:16.932
must display a miscellany of talents

25:17.015 --> 25:18.934
in her quest for a suitor.

25:19.017 --> 25:21.728
She must be a witty conversationalist,

25:21.811 --> 25:24.272
an accomplished musician,

25:24.814 --> 25:27.734
and an expert in the art of the swoon.

25:28.485 --> 25:31.988
For managing to faint
with nary a petticoat out of place

25:32.072 --> 25:34.449
is a most coveted talent indeed.

25:35.158 --> 25:37.577
Of course, not everyone has fallen victim

25:37.661 --> 25:40.997
to the royal fever sweeping
through London Town.

25:41.081 --> 25:44.668
One diamond in particular
seems quite immune…

25:44.751 --> 25:46.670
[Queen Charlotte]
"…making this author wonder

25:46.753 --> 25:48.713
if the crown has lost its luster."

25:49.548 --> 25:52.217
I know
what this insolent woman insinuates,

25:52.300 --> 25:54.511
and I shall certainly
not make allowances for it.

25:54.594 --> 25:55.762
Does she mean the king?

25:56.304 --> 25:58.306
Where on earth do they keep him anyway?

26:01.184 --> 26:04.938
The Bridgerton girl
is the incomparable of the season,

26:05.689 --> 26:08.441
which means there is
no more suitable a match for you

26:08.525 --> 26:09.734
on English shores.

26:10.360 --> 26:13.488
Miss Bridgerton is
a delightful young lady, to be sure.

26:13.572 --> 26:17.075
But if this gossip sheet is correct,
then her heart is already spoken for.

26:17.158 --> 26:19.619
Her heart is no matter,

26:19.703 --> 26:22.122
as long as her hand remains free.

26:23.206 --> 26:24.874
You are a prince.

26:25.917 --> 26:26.960
Charm her.

26:28.003 --> 26:29.629
[slow, repetitive piano playing]

26:34.217 --> 26:35.218
[Benedict sighs]

26:51.943 --> 26:53.820
Oh! Enough! I beg of you.

26:55.864 --> 26:57.365
Perhaps you should join me.

26:58.366 --> 27:01.661
You will need to be proficient
on the pianoforte soon enough.

27:02.412 --> 27:04.122
You could use the practice, I'm sure.

27:04.205 --> 27:05.415
On second thought, continue.

27:05.498 --> 27:07.167
You will frighten away
the duke, the prince,

27:07.250 --> 27:09.753
and any other eligible suitor
clear across the North Sea.

27:09.836 --> 27:12.213
And you would wish that upon me,
would you, Sister?

27:12.297 --> 27:15.925
If it kept Mama's attentions focused
on you instead of me, I might.

27:18.011 --> 27:20.263
You can take your reading outside.

27:21.014 --> 27:22.682
You say that
as if reading were a bad thing.

27:22.766 --> 27:23.767
I meant no such thing.

27:23.850 --> 27:25.852
But it won't gain me a husband?
That what you meant?

27:25.935 --> 27:26.853
[sighs] Eloise…

27:26.936 --> 27:29.397
You wish to follow your heart,
and I wish to nurture my mind.

27:30.523 --> 27:31.858
Let us leave it there.

27:31.941 --> 27:33.777
Can you at least try to understand?

27:34.569 --> 27:36.196
You never see things from my perspective.

27:36.279 --> 27:38.698
You are not the only one
with troubles, Eloise.

27:38.782 --> 27:40.283
You have no idea what it--

27:40.367 --> 27:41.284
[exasperated sigh]

27:43.995 --> 27:45.163
It does not matter.

27:50.543 --> 27:51.670
Is it an original?

27:53.004 --> 27:56.424
-What?
-That song, did you compose it yourself?

27:56.508 --> 27:57.842
In a manner of speaking.

27:57.926 --> 28:00.053
-What is the name of it?
-It does not have a name.

28:00.136 --> 28:03.181
-Every song has a name.
-It is just a song, Eloise.

28:06.601 --> 28:08.561
If you need to practice, then do so. Just…

28:09.562 --> 28:11.398
come up with a name for it, at least.

28:20.532 --> 28:23.284
[Daphne plays piano slowly]

28:23.368 --> 28:26.663
[townsfolk chattering]

28:56.234 --> 28:57.360
Why have you brought me here?

28:57.444 --> 29:01.072
Because I wanted you
to see your future firsthand,

29:01.156 --> 29:03.783
should you refuse
to follow my instructions.

29:04.325 --> 29:05.201
Heed me.

29:05.952 --> 29:09.789
This is what your life will be
if you do not agree to be married.

29:09.873 --> 29:13.460
You must have me mistaken for one
of your soft-handed daughters, ma'am.

29:13.543 --> 29:14.878
It is terribly presumptuous of you

29:14.961 --> 29:18.923
to think that a visit to this neighborhood
full of good, hardworking people

29:19.007 --> 29:20.717
who happen to be
less fortunate than yourself

29:20.800 --> 29:22.552
would ever sway me to change my mind.

29:22.635 --> 29:24.846
Look at the children, then. Go on.

29:24.929 --> 29:27.307
What, my dear,
might you have to say about them?

29:29.184 --> 29:31.144
I believe it is you who should heed me.

29:31.811 --> 29:34.230
I will not stand silently by
while you cut a sham

29:34.314 --> 29:36.691
with this miserable prospect
you have cooked up in your head.

29:36.775 --> 29:39.444
-I have a man who loves me.
-Is that so?

29:39.527 --> 29:43.531
Well, where is he, then?
Why is he not here, tending to you?

29:43.615 --> 29:45.492
Because he's fighting in Spain
for king and country.

29:45.575 --> 29:47.076
-Is he aware of your condition?
-He is.

29:47.160 --> 29:48.995
I have written to him,
beautiful love letters.

29:49.078 --> 29:52.290
And has he written back to you,
ever since informing him?

29:54.167 --> 29:59.255
Sweet child, many men make declarations
of love when they want to make love.

29:59.881 --> 30:02.592
But rare is the man
whose love remains true

30:02.675 --> 30:06.596
when the consequences of lovemaking
are brought to his attention.

30:22.403 --> 30:25.323
So, Miss Cowper
has finally found her match.

30:25.406 --> 30:28.368
A highly unlikely pairing,
if I may say so.

30:28.451 --> 30:30.537
I say good for the young lady.

30:30.620 --> 30:32.997
Perhaps it will keep
that horrid mother of hers off her back.

30:37.001 --> 30:40.171
-[Simon] He knew this, of course.
-[Daphne laughs]

30:40.255 --> 30:41.714
Or perhaps not.

30:42.882 --> 30:45.552
-And so Anthony Bridgerton…
-Mm.

30:45.635 --> 30:47.804
-…serious man that he is…
-[chuckles]

30:47.887 --> 30:50.348
…let a farm animal into your dormitory?

30:51.432 --> 30:53.393
Why ever would you put up
with such pranks?

30:53.476 --> 30:54.394
He was my friend.

30:54.477 --> 30:56.938
Who do you think helped your brother
get the animal back out?

30:57.021 --> 30:58.731
[Daphne] Of course it was you.

30:59.023 --> 31:01.192
My mother told me
something curious the other day.

31:01.276 --> 31:02.110
[Simon] Mm.

31:02.819 --> 31:05.321
That one should marry
one's dearest friend.

31:05.405 --> 31:08.074
-Are you suggesting I marry your brother?
-No.

31:09.033 --> 31:10.201
But I do wonder,

31:10.285 --> 31:12.662
is that truly what marriage
is all about, then?

31:12.745 --> 31:13.705
Friendship?

31:13.788 --> 31:15.331
Well, I imagine it a good start.

31:15.415 --> 31:17.500
Though most marriages
are more like battlefields.

31:17.584 --> 31:19.586
Even if it is a battlefield,

31:19.669 --> 31:22.505
there must be other things
that hold the troop together.

31:22.589 --> 31:25.592
My word! I might have thought
you were trying to organize a militia.

31:26.467 --> 31:27.302
Ah!

31:27.385 --> 31:29.762
Now, there is
a fine group of recruits.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.442
What I mean is

31:42.525 --> 31:44.152
there are other things…

31:45.111 --> 31:46.112
physical…

31:46.779 --> 31:49.073
or perhaps intangible…

31:50.366 --> 31:51.910
that bring a couple together.

31:53.202 --> 31:56.164
Well, yes, of course
there's more to a marriage,

31:56.247 --> 31:58.166
physical and intangible.

31:58.249 --> 31:59.125
-Both.
-Both?

31:59.208 --> 32:01.502
But how can something be
both physical and intangible

32:01.586 --> 32:03.087
when they are quite the opposite?

32:06.925 --> 32:09.135
-[laughs]
-You are beastly!

32:09.218 --> 32:10.178
Never mind.

32:10.261 --> 32:13.723
No. I'm not laughing at you.
I'm laughing at the absurdity

32:13.806 --> 32:15.475
of how little
mothers tell their daughters.

32:15.558 --> 32:16.601
They tell us nothing.

32:16.684 --> 32:19.520
-Well, I certainly cannot tell you.
-Why not?

32:19.604 --> 32:21.481
Because it is not my place.

32:22.649 --> 32:26.110
In any real courtship,
yes, it would be scandalous

32:26.194 --> 32:28.988
for her suitor
to discuss such things with a lady.

32:29.489 --> 32:32.241
But you are not a real suitor, are you?

32:33.284 --> 32:35.745
And besides,
no one else will tell me anything.

32:35.828 --> 32:37.664
So, how am I to find a proper husband

32:37.747 --> 32:39.749
if I do not even know
what I am to be searching for?

32:39.832 --> 32:42.585
-You will know when you know.
-What does that even mean?

32:42.669 --> 32:44.629
-I cannot tell you.
-I thought we were friends.

32:44.712 --> 32:45.672
-Daphne…
-Simon.

32:46.756 --> 32:47.590
Tell me.

32:48.424 --> 32:50.510
-Tell me!
-All right! All right!

32:52.178 --> 32:55.765
What happens between a husband and a wife…

32:55.848 --> 33:00.728
Well, it is a natural continuation
of what happens at night.

33:00.812 --> 33:01.813
At night?

33:01.896 --> 33:03.481
[chuckles] What happens at night?

33:04.482 --> 33:05.733
When you are alone.

33:06.317 --> 33:09.237
-When I am sleeping?
-Not when you are sleeping.

33:12.615 --> 33:13.908
When you touch yourself.

33:18.329 --> 33:20.748
You do touch yourself?

33:26.379 --> 33:30.633
When you are alone,
you can touch yourself…

33:32.176 --> 33:34.637
anywhere on your body,
anywhere that gives you pleasure,

33:35.388 --> 33:36.806
but especially…

33:37.807 --> 33:39.183
between your legs.

33:40.977 --> 33:43.312
And when you find a feeling
you particularly enjoy…

33:44.856 --> 33:46.482
you can carry on with that…

33:47.984 --> 33:51.654
until the feeling grows,
and eventually you reach…

33:53.865 --> 33:54.907
a pinnacle,

33:55.700 --> 33:56.826
a release.

34:04.917 --> 34:06.044
And that should help you…

34:08.713 --> 34:09.589
Come.

34:14.552 --> 34:16.888
-Ow!
-[Lady Danbury] I demand to know.

34:17.972 --> 34:21.642
Is all this time you are spending
with Miss Bridgerton leading anywhere?

34:22.226 --> 34:24.896
Could it not merely be time well spent?

34:25.688 --> 34:27.815
A prolonged courtship is one thing,

34:28.357 --> 34:30.818
but now it is very clear
to anyone with eyes

34:30.902 --> 34:33.988
that Daphne Bridgerton has caught
the attention of Prince Friedrich.

34:35.031 --> 34:38.117
If you have designs upon the girl
and wish to marry her,

34:38.201 --> 34:40.578
then Friedrich can disappear,
for all I care,

34:40.661 --> 34:42.830
and become
a delicious dinner party anecdote.

34:43.456 --> 34:45.750
But if you are merely dallying with her,

34:45.833 --> 34:49.837
and if she loses her chance
of such an extraordinary match,

34:49.921 --> 34:53.424
simply because
she is too wrapped up in your charms…

34:54.509 --> 34:55.343
well, then…

34:56.427 --> 34:57.970
she would be a fool,

34:58.054 --> 35:01.140
and I would never forgive you
your carelessness.

35:01.224 --> 35:03.267
Miss Bridgerton is far from a fool.

35:03.351 --> 35:05.144
Then you are just being cruel,

35:05.645 --> 35:08.439
and we both know
I taught you better than that.

35:20.118 --> 35:21.202
[splutters]

35:21.786 --> 35:22.620
Oh.

35:24.914 --> 35:25.832
[Eloise chuckles]

35:29.627 --> 35:30.670
[Benedict sighs]

35:38.261 --> 35:40.429
I found bits of your sketchbook
in the fireplace.

35:40.513 --> 35:42.014
-Are you spying on me now?
-[chuckles]

35:42.098 --> 35:44.851
You'd actually have to be interesting
for me to bother spying on you.

35:45.768 --> 35:47.603
The drawings
in that sketchbook were abominable.

35:47.687 --> 35:49.021
I could not stand to look at them.

35:49.105 --> 35:51.023
I believe
that is why they call it a sketchbook.

35:51.774 --> 35:55.319
I write in my diary, which is not the same
as writing in my novel.

35:56.779 --> 35:59.490
[chuckles] It must be very difficult
to want something

35:59.574 --> 36:00.992
-and not be able to get it.
-Eloise…

36:01.075 --> 36:03.452
If you enjoy drawing
but need practice, then practice.

36:03.536 --> 36:05.288
Hire a drawing master.

36:05.371 --> 36:07.540
Find a young lady to act impressed.

36:07.623 --> 36:09.208
If you desire the sun and the moon,

36:09.292 --> 36:11.878
all you have to do is go out
and shoot at the sky.

36:11.961 --> 36:13.129
Some of us cannot.

36:15.131 --> 36:18.718
Look no further than Lady Whistledown.
She possesses a huge talent for writing,

36:18.801 --> 36:21.345
and yet she must hide away
and publish under a false name.

36:21.429 --> 36:23.556
Yes, because if anyone knew
who Whistledown truly was,

36:23.639 --> 36:25.183
she'd be strung up for what she said.

36:25.266 --> 36:26.517
That is not my point.

36:26.601 --> 36:29.896
Whistledown is a woman,
therefore she has nothing,

36:30.396 --> 36:32.398
and still she writes.

36:32.481 --> 36:34.650
You're a man,
therefore you have everything.

36:34.734 --> 36:38.988
You are able to do whatever you want.
So do it. Be bold.

36:40.448 --> 36:44.285
At least that way
I can live vicariously through you.

36:45.745 --> 36:46.704
Eloise…

36:48.915 --> 36:50.291
are you Lady Whistledown?

36:50.374 --> 36:52.168
[chuckles ironically]

36:52.251 --> 36:55.755
You're an accomplished writer,
always scribbling in that diary of yours.

36:55.838 --> 36:57.757
You certainly know
everyone else's business.

36:57.840 --> 37:00.551
You have more opinions
than anyone else I know in London.

37:01.135 --> 37:04.055
You would have my full support
and admiration either way, Sister.

37:04.138 --> 37:05.932
So… is it you?

37:06.557 --> 37:07.391
No.

37:08.434 --> 37:09.518
Though if it were…

37:10.686 --> 37:12.647
do you honestly think that I'd admit it?

37:35.753 --> 37:37.755
[light piano music plays]

37:57.483 --> 37:58.859
[music intensifies]

38:14.875 --> 38:15.876
[gasps lightly]

38:19.088 --> 38:21.173
[Daphne playing piano]

38:24.885 --> 38:25.886
[piano playing ends]

38:27.096 --> 38:29.849
You finished. How lovely!

38:31.767 --> 38:34.020
I do hope
you have finally given it a name.

38:39.275 --> 38:40.151
Wait here.

38:44.322 --> 38:47.450
So, I was thinking
about us doing something different.

38:47.533 --> 38:50.786
The ice flavors here are divine, yes,
but, well, perhaps the two of us--

38:50.870 --> 38:53.122
I shall not be joining you today,
Miss Bridgerton.

38:55.082 --> 38:58.002
Nor tomorrow,
nor any longer, for that matter.

39:00.421 --> 39:02.923
-What can you mean?
-Is it not obvious?

39:03.007 --> 39:05.217
Apparently not,
if I require your further elaboration.

39:05.301 --> 39:07.887
You now have a bevy of suitors
at your disposal,

39:07.970 --> 39:10.348
and I've been afforded relief
from mamas and daughters alike

39:10.431 --> 39:12.975
in order to conduct my affairs in peace
whilst remaining in London.

39:13.059 --> 39:15.061
Thus our arrangement has succeeded,
Miss Bridgerton.

39:15.144 --> 39:15.978
Stop calling me that.

39:16.062 --> 39:18.731
-These very circumstances prove…
-What are you doing?

39:18.814 --> 39:21.025
…our ruse should hereby need to end.

39:22.276 --> 39:24.236
-Have I done something wrong?
-No.

39:25.196 --> 39:26.238
Then tell me why.

39:26.322 --> 39:30.076
You have the attentions of a prince.
He is perfect for you.

39:32.078 --> 39:34.080
This is about our conversation yesterday.

39:34.163 --> 39:36.707
-I apologize for that.
-There is no need to apologize.

39:36.791 --> 39:39.877
Your brother was correct.
I am and always will be a rake.

39:39.960 --> 39:42.088
-Before I corrupt you any further--
-Corrupt me?

39:42.171 --> 39:43.964
I assure you, I am quite capable

39:44.048 --> 39:46.884
of deciding the bounds
of my own propriety.

39:46.967 --> 39:48.886
I thought you and I were friends.

39:50.930 --> 39:52.223
We were never friends.

39:52.306 --> 39:54.809
I do not believe
there could be a more ridiculous notion

39:54.892 --> 39:57.269
than that of us ever being friends.

39:57.353 --> 40:00.022
A young lady,
barely out of her leading strings, you…

40:02.149 --> 40:03.609
You were a convenience…

40:04.819 --> 40:07.405
a diversion,
a pretty one at that, but nothing more.

40:08.322 --> 40:09.990
Now that I've concluded
my business in town,

40:10.074 --> 40:11.200
I shall be moving on.

40:11.784 --> 40:13.202
I suggest you do the same.

40:16.414 --> 40:20.126
You will be very happy
with your prince, Miss Bridgerton.

40:22.920 --> 40:23.921
[gasps]

40:28.634 --> 40:31.387
We must bring forward our plans
to vacate England as soon as possible.

40:31.470 --> 40:33.681
But, Your Grace,
you still have some business to conclude.

40:33.764 --> 40:36.642
I wish to leave.
Do what you must to expedite matters.

40:39.437 --> 40:40.896
[sobbing breaths]

40:42.189 --> 40:43.816
Did something happen, miss?

40:46.026 --> 40:46.861
[whimpers]

40:51.907 --> 40:53.909
[Rose] Miss? Miss?

40:55.161 --> 40:56.370
Leave me be, Rose.

40:59.457 --> 41:00.916
[singing aria]

41:07.047 --> 41:09.300
[attendees chattering]

41:09.383 --> 41:11.802
[aria singing continues]

42:03.312 --> 42:05.856
[indistinct chatter]

42:22.915 --> 42:24.583
A gentleman is here for you.

42:36.178 --> 42:39.557
To what do I owe this unexpected visit?

42:39.640 --> 42:42.184
-I wanted to see you.
-What is it this time?

42:42.268 --> 42:45.271
A ball you wish not to attend?
A family obligation you prefer to avoid?

42:45.354 --> 42:47.523
What, perchance,

42:47.606 --> 42:50.693
is the Viscount Bridgerton
seeking to escape tonight?

42:52.111 --> 42:53.696
Surprising as it may be to you,

42:53.779 --> 42:56.282
I do not sit here
merely waiting for your visits.

42:56.865 --> 42:59.201
-I have plans of my own to attend.
-With the duke?

42:59.285 --> 43:01.787
My affairs are
no longer your concern, sir,

43:01.870 --> 43:03.789
as you have already made abundantly clear.

43:03.872 --> 43:06.875
If you are using Hastings
in some scheme to vex me, Siena…

43:06.959 --> 43:11.255
Well, he is certainly a handsome man
of great wealth and high rank,

43:11.338 --> 43:13.090
everything a woman in my position
might want.

43:13.173 --> 43:15.634
-Your vindictiveness is noted--
-The duke has not called on me.

43:16.302 --> 43:17.136
[sighs]

43:17.219 --> 43:19.888
And I am not consorting
with any friend of yours.

43:20.431 --> 43:22.266
[chuckles ironically] Though I must say,

43:23.100 --> 43:25.436
it is not surprising in the least

43:25.519 --> 43:28.814
to know that you are only here
because you are jealous.

43:28.897 --> 43:30.899
-I'm not here because I'm jealous.
-Goodbye, my lord.

43:30.983 --> 43:33.694
I am here because I miss you! [panting]

43:34.820 --> 43:37.740
I cannot think of anything else, Siena.

43:38.949 --> 43:40.075
Come back to me.

43:42.911 --> 43:44.204
[Siena panting]

43:44.788 --> 43:47.249
Your position in life remains unchanged.

43:48.125 --> 43:49.752
And so, too, does mine.

43:50.669 --> 43:52.504
You are the viscount.

43:52.588 --> 43:56.508
Your responsibility will always be
to that title, above all else.

43:56.592 --> 44:00.387
You shall marry, sire an heir,
and guard your family.

44:00.471 --> 44:04.099
And I… I shall always be
the woman you may love in darkness…

44:04.183 --> 44:06.310
-No.
-…but never in the light of day.

44:07.353 --> 44:11.106
You have made me promises before,
and I, like a fool, believed them.

44:13.484 --> 44:14.443
[sighs]

44:15.194 --> 44:17.237
I cannot be your fool again.

44:19.448 --> 44:21.450
[footsteps retreating]

44:31.752 --> 44:33.128
[horse neighs]

44:35.631 --> 44:37.132
[man] Post has arrived!

44:44.223 --> 44:45.557
[sighs lightly]

44:59.780 --> 45:02.116
Marina, it is here. A letter from Spain.

45:02.199 --> 45:04.368
It must be from Sir George.
He has written back to you.

45:10.457 --> 45:12.793
Well, what does he say?

45:17.381 --> 45:18.215
Well?

45:25.723 --> 45:28.350
What has happened?
Marina, has he been wounded?

45:29.935 --> 45:32.438
He pretends there was nothing between us.

45:33.731 --> 45:34.815
How do you mean?

45:35.607 --> 45:37.109
He says he desires…

45:38.235 --> 45:40.070
nothing more to do with me,

45:40.738 --> 45:41.822
or our…

45:44.199 --> 45:45.993
my situation.

45:48.287 --> 45:50.247
That he had no part in it.

45:52.040 --> 45:54.460
[Marina sobs]

45:59.923 --> 46:02.468
[Marina wails]

46:02.551 --> 46:03.969
[muffled wailing]

46:06.513 --> 46:07.473
So…

46:08.682 --> 46:11.059
it would seem
our efforts were not in vain.

46:11.143 --> 46:12.811
[dramatic music plays]

46:17.483 --> 46:18.984
[Varley] I believe…

46:20.611 --> 46:22.321
Oh, it is quite exact, ma'am.

46:22.988 --> 46:25.532
Make certain you place the letters
just the way we found them

46:25.616 --> 46:27.534
beneath Miss Thompson's pillow.

46:29.453 --> 46:31.955
What do we do
when her soldier arrives home, ma'am?

46:32.039 --> 46:33.832
If he should return,
I can say with certainty,

46:33.916 --> 46:35.793
he will not be coming to collect her.

46:36.335 --> 46:38.462
[Marina wails]

46:39.588 --> 46:42.007
She was going to learn the truth
about men one way or another.

46:42.090 --> 46:45.719
We have done what is right
and what is best,

46:45.803 --> 46:47.679
and now she is protected.

46:47.763 --> 46:50.265
Now, draw my arches lower.

46:50.349 --> 46:52.392
Otherwise, I'll have a look
of constant astonishment

46:52.476 --> 46:53.519
on my face all day.

47:02.194 --> 47:04.613
[indistinct conversation in background]

47:06.657 --> 47:07.950
Beautiful, dearest.

47:10.327 --> 47:11.870
Ah, Lady Bridgerton.

47:12.871 --> 47:14.289
-Lady Cowper.
-Hmm.

47:16.375 --> 47:22.422
I must say, it is a good thing
Daphne is so taken by the duke.

47:23.590 --> 47:25.342
Uh… Well, thank--

47:25.425 --> 47:29.263
Cressida would never have a hope with
the prince if your Daphne went for him.

47:29.763 --> 47:33.016
We all know my darling
might have the fortune,

47:33.100 --> 47:36.228
but it is your Daphne who has the face.

47:36.979 --> 47:38.397
[Lady Cowper chuckles]

47:41.066 --> 47:42.317
[shop door opens]

47:44.570 --> 47:45.487
[shop door closes]

47:47.823 --> 47:48.949
[sighs]

47:52.953 --> 47:55.205
[light music plays]

47:55.289 --> 47:57.040
You can put that dress away, Rose.

47:57.124 --> 47:58.750
Are we not attending
the ball this evening?

47:58.834 --> 47:59.668
No, we are,

47:59.751 --> 48:02.045
but I shall wear
the white and silver instead.

48:02.129 --> 48:03.922
And will you do my hair
just the way you like

48:04.006 --> 48:05.549
with the circlet of jewels and flowers?

48:05.632 --> 48:07.509
Of course. You will look perfect.

48:07.593 --> 48:10.345
Good. That is what they want.

48:24.943 --> 48:27.696
Will you be joining us
at tonight's ball, Anthony?

48:27.779 --> 48:29.948
I have accepted the invitation.

48:30.032 --> 48:32.910
Perhaps you might cast your eye
over this list before the event, then.

48:32.993 --> 48:33.952
What is this?

48:34.036 --> 48:37.289
These are names. Fourteen, to be exact.

48:37.372 --> 48:42.169
Fourteen single, eligible young ladies,
all from excellent families.

48:42.252 --> 48:44.004
Lady Leeworth's eldest miss is--

48:44.087 --> 48:46.465
I shall consider your suggestions.
Thank you.

48:53.430 --> 48:54.598
Was there something else?

48:54.681 --> 48:56.141
What time do you have?

48:57.768 --> 48:58.685
What?

48:58.769 --> 49:00.020
The time.

49:00.896 --> 49:03.023
You were just checking
your father's old watch

49:03.106 --> 49:04.566
when I caught you, yes?

49:05.901 --> 49:07.527
It is a lovely heirloom.

49:09.237 --> 49:10.697
It is quarter till, Mother.

49:10.781 --> 49:12.741
It's quite late, indeed.

49:13.408 --> 49:16.203
At any rate, do let me know
who I should introduce you to, my dear.

49:17.120 --> 49:19.581
Time, as we both know,

49:19.665 --> 49:21.375
is certainly of the essence.

49:30.300 --> 49:31.301
[Anthony sighs]

49:34.888 --> 49:37.307
-[attendees chattering]
-[soft piano music plays]

49:47.234 --> 49:49.361
Prinzessin Cressida.

49:49.444 --> 49:51.571
It rolls right off the tongue,
does it not?

50:02.499 --> 50:05.460
Miss Thompson,
how lovely to see you back with us.

50:05.544 --> 50:08.755
-Might I have your next dance?
-I would be delighted, my lord.

50:17.472 --> 50:20.684
You have been rather reserved all evening,
Your Grace.

50:20.767 --> 50:23.437
I have decided
to leave England earlier than expected.

50:24.229 --> 50:27.649
Apologies, Lady Danbury,
but I believe it is time for me to go.

50:30.068 --> 50:31.069
You're foolish.

50:37.075 --> 50:39.161
Are you feeling all right, dearest?

50:39.661 --> 50:40.787
Exceptionally.

50:41.747 --> 50:44.416
[swelling music plays]

51:32.005 --> 51:33.507
[music, no dialogue]

52:07.749 --> 52:10.585
Miss Bridgerton,
I simply must have your first dance.

52:11.253 --> 52:13.130
It would be an honor, Your Highness.

52:25.183 --> 52:26.643
[music continues]

52:36.570 --> 52:38.196
[Lady Whistledown] Could it be true?

52:38.280 --> 52:43.827
The season's diamond even more precious
and rare a stone than previously thought?

52:45.203 --> 52:49.374
For it now appears
this treasure is set to join the likes

52:49.457 --> 52:53.503
of the queen's ever-so-cherished
crown jewels themselves.

52:54.462 --> 52:55.922
The Duke of Hastings, I hear,

52:56.006 --> 52:58.675
was left looking
rather tongue-tied last night,

52:58.758 --> 53:02.596
as Miss Bridgerton seems
to have finally grown tired

53:02.679 --> 53:06.516
of waiting for him
to pose that all-important question.

53:15.358 --> 53:19.529
Or, perhaps,
the young miss has simply traded up.

53:20.322 --> 53:22.240
Surprising? Quite.

53:22.324 --> 53:25.243
Unreasonable? Of course not.

53:25.785 --> 53:29.748
After all, why settle for a duke

53:30.457 --> 53:33.501
when one can have a prince?

53:35.420 --> 53:37.005
[music crescendos]
