NARRATOR: Previously, on Stargate SG-1.

00:04.830 --> 00:07.700
The stones are actually an Ancient form
of communication device

00:07.800 --> 00:08.860
that Iinks the users psychically,

00:08.970 --> 00:11.270
allowing them to see
through each other's eyes.

00:11.370 --> 00:13.340
I think we're in them.

00:13.580 --> 00:14.870
We're from another galaxy!

00:14.980 --> 00:20.880
Great holy armies shall be gathered
and trained to fight all who embrace evil.

00:21.050 --> 00:23.310
In the name of the gods,
ships shall be built

00:23.420 --> 00:26.180
to carry our warriors out
amongst the stars.

00:26.290 --> 00:27.480
JACKSON: Doesn't that Iook
an awful Iot Iike a...

00:27.590 --> 00:28.580
MITCHELL: Yeah, it does.

00:28.790 --> 00:30.760
It can't be,
because I was gonna say stargate.

00:30.860 --> 00:32.020
CARTER: Try supergate.

00:32.130 --> 00:34.560
-What are you doing?
-VALA ON RADIO: Trying to help, Daniel.

00:34.660 --> 00:36.650
Someone had to do something,
and you wouldn 't Iisten.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.830
The singularity is forming.

00:45.170 --> 00:47.840
Merlin was conducting research
on some kind of new invention.

00:47.940 --> 00:50.670
A weapon capable of destroying
Ascended beings.

00:50.780 --> 00:52.770
I don't need to know Ancient
to understand what that is.

00:52.880 --> 00:55.580
A gate address
to where he hid the weapon.

01:11.130 --> 01:14.070
-Morning.
-Have you seen Colonel Mitchell?

01:14.470 --> 01:15.830
Men's locker.

(VALA WHISTLING)

01:46.630 --> 01:47.790
MlTCHELL: Jackson?

01:48.870 --> 01:50.600
Is there something I should know?

01:52.970 --> 01:54.170
(GIGGLES)

03:00.540 --> 03:02.310
How is this possible?

03:04.380 --> 03:05.680
Oh, my God.

03:06.410 --> 03:08.970
It worked. I mean, you know, it's working.

03:11.520 --> 03:13.680
We didn't think we were ever
gonna make this work.

03:13.920 --> 03:15.180
Make what work?

03:15.790 --> 03:18.020
Well, since you disintegrated
the Alteran communication stones

03:18.130 --> 03:21.060
-and base terminal in the kawoosh...
-I'm sorry, the what?

03:21.160 --> 03:23.930
The unstable vortex
of a forming wormhole. Kawoosh.

03:24.130 --> 03:25.790
I don't think I've ever heard you
call it that before.

03:25.900 --> 03:26.920
Really?

03:27.040 --> 03:29.160
-Don't get me wrong. It's good.
-No, I mean, I'm sure...

03:29.270 --> 03:33.600
Hello. Hi. My name is Vala,
but I'm in Daniel Jackson right now.

03:34.580 --> 03:36.310
Anyway, we've been working on a way

03:36.410 --> 03:39.010
of artificially emulating
the Alteran technology.

03:39.650 --> 03:41.340
Dr. Lee was able to collect
quite a bit of data

03:41.450 --> 03:42.710
from the time that you were unconscious

03:42.820 --> 03:44.840
and communicating
with the people from the Ori galaxy.

03:45.290 --> 03:47.750
So using that and this Tok'ra
subspace communicator,

03:47.860 --> 03:48.910
we've been trying to mimic

03:49.020 --> 03:51.290
the frequencies sent and received
by the stones.

03:51.760 --> 03:53.190
We just didn't think
we were having any luck.

03:53.290 --> 03:55.390
I'm really glad you are.
I was desperately hoping...

03:55.500 --> 03:57.730
-So, you're in the Ori galaxy?
-Yes.

03:57.830 --> 03:59.300
Are you able to communicate with Daniel?

03:59.400 --> 04:01.600
No, just see and hear you.

04:01.700 --> 04:04.070
You see, we've been using
the data collected from the stone

04:04.170 --> 04:05.830
that Daniel activated on this end,

04:05.940 --> 04:08.840
which is why
you're connected to his body.

04:09.880 --> 04:13.610
It's funny, isn't it? Daniel always wanted
to get into my pants, and now I'm in his.

04:13.720 --> 04:14.910
Oh, that's not funny.

04:15.780 --> 04:17.180
He can't defend himself.

04:17.790 --> 04:21.480
Okay, you, Vala,
were the only other person on this end

04:21.590 --> 04:23.450
-to touch the stone. So...
-Oh, I get it.

04:23.560 --> 04:25.750
I can't exactly connect to myself
if I'm not here, so...

04:25.860 --> 04:27.760
You know, last time
we couldn't break the connection.

04:27.860 --> 04:30.130
Well, that should be easy. This time
we just shut down the computer.

04:30.230 --> 04:34.570
No. I mean, not yet.
I didn't just drop in to say hello.

04:34.670 --> 04:36.970
I have something
very important to tell you.

04:39.340 --> 04:41.140
VALA: I remember
staggering into the rings.

04:41.240 --> 04:43.270
There were bolts of energy everywhere.

04:43.380 --> 04:44.680
CARTER: We suspected
that the matter stream

04:44.780 --> 04:45.910
was sucked into the black hole.

04:46.680 --> 04:50.210
We all appreciate the part you played
in destroying the enemy beachhead.

04:50.450 --> 04:51.940
VALA: Don't mention it.

04:53.390 --> 04:55.480
By "part," I assume you mean lead role.

04:56.860 --> 04:58.620
(LAUGHING) We're happy to hear
that you're okay.

04:58.730 --> 05:00.790
Actually, for the record,
I never said I was okay.

05:00.900 --> 05:04.020
Actually, the timing of this
is a little awkward.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.960
Sir, if we disconnect now,
there's no guarantee

05:06.070 --> 05:07.630
that we can reestablish the link.

05:07.740 --> 05:09.460
Dr. Jackson was supposed to join me

05:09.570 --> 05:12.440
to meet with the Russian and Chinese
representatives of the lOA

05:12.540 --> 05:13.870
in about a half an hour.

05:14.040 --> 05:17.710
They requested that he be there,
said it was a matter of great importance.

05:17.810 --> 05:20.280
Not as important
as what I have to tell you, believe me.

05:20.380 --> 05:21.940
I'll try and be as quick as I can,

05:22.050 --> 05:23.780
and then you can have Daniel back,
I promise.

05:27.690 --> 05:30.390
So, the next thing I remember
was waking up in a bed

05:30.560 --> 05:32.290
in a village like Ver Eger.

05:32.390 --> 05:34.520
That's the one
that Harrid and Sallis lived in.

05:34.630 --> 05:37.530
They're the people that Daniel and l
inhabited for a while.

05:40.840 --> 05:43.930
Anyway, it turns out this village
was called Ver Isca.

05:44.540 --> 05:46.060
(VALA SLURPING)

05:48.440 --> 05:51.780
You know, this water is lovely,

05:52.250 --> 05:54.080
but I think Daniel skipped breakfast,

05:54.180 --> 05:57.910
and I suddenly have a craving
for pancakes and ice cream.

05:58.520 --> 06:01.510
Double chocolate fudge brownie,
if memory serves.

06:04.460 --> 06:07.120
Oh, I'll continue while you rustle that up.

06:09.300 --> 06:10.460
Thanks.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.760
-So, where was l?
-ln bed.

06:13.870 --> 06:14.930
Oh, yes, in bed.

06:15.040 --> 06:18.060
A man named Tomin
had apparently found me

06:18.170 --> 06:21.040
Iying unconscious in the rings
and had thought

06:21.140 --> 06:23.170
the gods had sent me to him,

06:25.480 --> 06:28.570
which I Iet him continue to believe.

06:29.120 --> 06:30.210
Hi.

06:32.320 --> 06:34.720
You feel strong enough to get up
and go for a walk today?

06:34.820 --> 06:35.880
Maybe.

06:41.700 --> 06:43.690
I'll be back after prostration.

06:44.500 --> 06:45.730
Have fun.

06:48.240 --> 06:49.500
Thank you.

06:56.510 --> 06:58.140
VALA: It was obvious he was smitten.

06:59.080 --> 07:00.740
Who could blame him, right?

07:02.380 --> 07:03.510
Thanks.

07:05.420 --> 07:06.480
What?

07:13.330 --> 07:14.450
Thanks.

07:15.300 --> 07:18.360
I do realize he was a devout Ori follower

07:19.230 --> 07:20.890
and probably would've been standing
on the frontline

07:21.000 --> 07:23.490
cheering while they burnt me to death,
if he knew the truth about me,

07:23.600 --> 07:26.230
but he was very sweet in his own way.

07:27.440 --> 07:29.140
And not bad Iooking, actually.

07:37.090 --> 07:39.520
I think Tomin had been on his own
before I came along,

07:39.620 --> 07:43.450
mostly due to a Iimp
that had Ieft him crippled since childhood.

07:44.330 --> 07:46.160
He didn 't Iike to talk about it much,

07:46.730 --> 07:50.290
but I could see that the other villagers
Iooked down on him because of it.

07:50.670 --> 07:54.570
In their minds, the Ori must ha ve
deemed him unfit for normalcy,

07:54.670 --> 07:56.600
so that's how they chose to see him.

07:57.310 --> 07:58.900
I did my best to blend in.

07:59.440 --> 08:00.930
At first, according to Tomin,

08:01.040 --> 08:02.940
and therefore as far
as the villagers were concerned,

08:03.040 --> 08:07.450
I was the woman who fell from the sky,
which made me feel kind of special.

08:07.650 --> 08:10.580
I later learned they always suspected
I'd escaped from another village

08:10.690 --> 08:11.910
as a result of some scandal,

08:12.020 --> 08:14.850
and then I started to feel
much more like I'm used to.

08:19.830 --> 08:22.920
What worried me most were the Ori.

08:23.770 --> 08:26.960
While no one had actually seen me
or Daniel in person, that didn 't mean

08:27.070 --> 08:29.800
that Ascended beings
couldn 't recognize me.

08:32.470 --> 08:35.310
After a while, I started to think and hope

08:35.410 --> 08:37.400
that maybe things were going to be okay.

08:39.380 --> 08:41.780
Ultimately, my goal was to try
and find a way back here

08:41.880 --> 08:43.980
or, at the very least,
try and communicate with you,

08:44.290 --> 08:46.150
to Iet you know what was going on.

08:46.320 --> 08:47.720
(MUSIC PLAYING)

08:49.320 --> 08:53.190
So, I figured my best bet was to root out
any of Fannis'gang

08:53.290 --> 08:56.230
from the anti-Ori underground.
See if they had any technology

08:56.330 --> 09:00.390
or any information about an Ori stargate
I might possibly gain access to,

09:00.800 --> 09:03.000
but I had to be very careful.

09:03.470 --> 09:08.100
The village was run by this
complete bear of a man named Seevis,

09:08.210 --> 09:12.150
who was both barkeep and administrator,

09:12.410 --> 09:15.280
which seemed the oddest contradiction.

09:15.580 --> 09:17.740
He claimed to be
the most pious man in the village,

09:18.220 --> 09:20.590
and if anyone strayed
from the path of righteousness,

09:20.690 --> 09:24.180
it was Seevis who made sure
you were severely punished for it.

09:24.890 --> 09:29.190
But there seems to be a Iot more Ieeway
for sin in the religion of Origin

09:29.300 --> 09:31.770
than one would presume
from all the preaching.

09:31.970 --> 09:34.430
So it's just like my grandma used to say,

09:34.540 --> 09:37.470
"No point going to confession
if you ain't got nothing to confess."

09:40.040 --> 09:42.130
-Exactly.
-SEEVIS: By the gods,

09:42.310 --> 09:44.440
I do not know what the Ori
blessed you with,

09:44.550 --> 09:47.840
because it was not brains
and it was not looks.

09:47.980 --> 09:49.680
What makes you think
that something like her

09:49.780 --> 09:54.050
would have anything to do
with a rodent like you without reason?

09:54.720 --> 09:58.090
-I'll pay, I swear.
-Oh, I know you will,

09:58.760 --> 10:01.250
or I'll make you wish
you were being burned alive

10:01.360 --> 10:03.260
by the fires of Celestis.

10:11.370 --> 10:14.710
I have picked things more precious
out from between my toes.

10:20.110 --> 10:23.610
VALA: I soon realized
it wasn 't a contradiction at all.

10:25.090 --> 10:28.020
Seevis was doing the work of the gods
by making sure this village

10:28.120 --> 10:31.060
had every reason in the world to prostrate,

10:31.160 --> 10:35.250
making him a very rich
and very powerful man in the process.

10:35.500 --> 10:38.930
Believe me, I usually applaud
the colorful details of a good story,

10:39.030 --> 10:41.630
especially when told
with such interesting intergalactic

10:41.740 --> 10:46.300
and body-snatching means,
but Daniel and I are late

10:46.410 --> 10:48.640
to meet with the Russian
and Chinese representatives.

10:48.740 --> 10:51.640
You stated that you had information
of great importance.

10:51.750 --> 10:55.080
-I do, I do, and I'm getting to it.
-MlTCHELL: We got the back story.

10:55.480 --> 10:58.280
Tomin is a nice guy. Seevis is a butthead.

10:59.090 --> 11:02.350
-How about you skip ahead a little?
-Fine.

11:05.190 --> 11:07.990
-Tomin and I got married.
-Married?

11:08.100 --> 11:10.120
Stay with me. I had no choice.

11:10.230 --> 11:11.600
I told you he was very devout,

11:11.700 --> 11:14.530
and there's no way
he would've slept with me out of wedlock.

11:18.370 --> 11:21.210
Okay, maybe we skipped ahead
a little too far.

11:21.310 --> 11:23.210
Well, I tried to lay it out in order.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.070
That's a bad choice of words.

11:26.180 --> 11:29.510
Okay, why exactly did you have no choice?

11:29.620 --> 11:31.980
You know what these people do to you
when you do something wrong?

11:32.090 --> 11:33.250
They burn you alive.

11:33.390 --> 11:35.480
And why would they burn you alive
this time?

11:35.790 --> 11:37.850
For getting pregnant out of wedlock.

11:40.490 --> 11:42.220
-You're pregnant?
-Yes.

11:44.470 --> 11:46.460
I keep forgetting
you can't actually see me.

11:46.930 --> 11:49.330
When I realized
why I was feeling sick all the time,

11:49.440 --> 11:50.870
I figured I had to do something.

11:50.970 --> 11:54.430
I decided my only choice was
to marry Tomin as quickly as possible

11:54.540 --> 11:55.840
and pray the timing was close enough

11:55.940 --> 11:57.500
so he could be convinced
the baby was his.

11:57.610 --> 11:59.410
All right, hold the phone.

11:59.550 --> 12:04.080
And I ask this not 100% sure
that I want to know the answer.

12:06.290 --> 12:08.850
-Whose baby is it?
-That's the thing.

12:09.820 --> 12:11.290
I don't know.

12:12.230 --> 12:14.060
-As in...
-I swear,

12:14.360 --> 12:17.890
I did none of the necessary bits.

12:21.670 --> 12:26.130
Between my arrival in the Ori galaxy
and my wedding night,

12:26.470 --> 12:30.640
which was definitely after I knew for sure,

12:31.150 --> 12:34.510
there is no way humanly possible
that I know of

12:35.580 --> 12:37.350
that I could've gotten pregnant.

12:46.660 --> 12:48.360
VALA: Someone going to say something?

12:50.200 --> 12:51.390
Anybody?

12:56.740 --> 13:00.000
You have been impregnated
without copulation?

13:00.110 --> 13:02.170
Yes, and I'm absolutely terrified.

13:02.280 --> 13:05.070
Have any of you ever heard
of anything like it?

13:11.450 --> 13:13.820
-Well, there's one.
-Darth Vader.

13:15.820 --> 13:16.810
Really?

13:17.390 --> 13:20.290
-How did that turn out?
-Actually, I was thinking of King Arthur.

13:21.400 --> 13:22.380
You were?

13:22.500 --> 13:25.400
Yeah, I've been reading everything
I can find on our Ancient friend, Merlin.

13:25.500 --> 13:29.960
According to some of the legends,
he enchanted the queen who bore Arthur.

13:30.070 --> 13:31.830
-I have to go.
-Wait.

13:31.940 --> 13:34.570
I haven't even gotten to the bit
you have to hear yet.

13:35.380 --> 13:38.780
Me carrying this child right now
is a problem, a big problem for me,

13:39.510 --> 13:42.180
but believe me there is one
which is much, much bigger.

13:51.990 --> 13:53.430
It's a miracle.

13:56.960 --> 13:58.300
Look at me.

14:04.940 --> 14:06.430
The Prior blessed me.

14:08.040 --> 14:11.940
I can walk. I can run. I can fight now.

14:12.680 --> 14:14.770
-You can what?
-I've been conscripted.

14:18.120 --> 14:22.180
VALA: They are building ships and armies
by the tens of thousands.

14:23.320 --> 14:28.560
The village I am living in is one of many
on a world among dozens like it.

14:29.700 --> 14:32.100
As we feared since the day
Daniel met the Ori,

14:32.200 --> 14:35.170
they have been preparing their followers
for a crusade.

14:37.570 --> 14:41.340
-Are you sure this is what you want?
-Are you serious?

14:42.210 --> 14:45.340
I never dreamed I would one day be fit
to serve the Ori in this way.

14:47.820 --> 14:50.880
By killing people you know nothing about?

14:51.620 --> 14:54.520
All I need to know
is that they are enemy of the Ori,

14:54.890 --> 14:58.550
that they reject the teachings of Origin
and would have us stray from the path.

14:58.660 --> 15:03.060
But these so-called unbelievers,
they're so far away,

15:03.160 --> 15:05.720
how can they affect us? Why do we have
to go all the way over there...

15:05.830 --> 15:08.100
Evil must not be allowed
to fester anywhere.

15:08.200 --> 15:09.500
(SIGHS)

15:11.070 --> 15:15.700
Our journey towards enlightenment
may take us to many unexpected places.

15:20.450 --> 15:25.320
I cannot imagine you killing anyone.

15:26.390 --> 15:29.190
I'm not afraid to heed the will of the gods.

15:33.630 --> 15:36.490
Nothing I say will change your mind,
will it?

15:37.130 --> 15:38.360
Fear not.

15:38.600 --> 15:42.040
Once we warriors of Ori
have vanquished the wicked,

15:43.070 --> 15:44.630
I shall return.

15:51.280 --> 15:53.110
You will not be the same.

15:54.620 --> 15:55.600
No.

15:58.390 --> 16:03.790
VALA: He is one of the gentlest,
most honest souls I have ever known.

16:15.240 --> 16:18.500
He has been raised since birth
to believe in the Ori,

16:18.910 --> 16:20.310
to follow Origin.

16:20.570 --> 16:23.130
This isn't a fight anyone can win,

16:23.640 --> 16:25.840
not without a tragic amount of bloodshed.

16:26.950 --> 16:28.780
HARRIMAN ON P.A. SYSTEM:
General Landry to the briefing room.

16:28.880 --> 16:30.980
General Landry,
please report to the briefing room.

16:31.090 --> 16:33.420
I better get down there. Go ahead.

16:35.220 --> 16:37.590
Since you've been gone,
we've learned a few things

16:37.690 --> 16:40.320
about the Ori that their followers
might be interested to know.

16:40.430 --> 16:42.730
It doesn't matter what the truth is
about the Ori.

16:42.830 --> 16:45.260
The people won't hear it,
no matter what you say.

16:45.370 --> 16:49.630
Obviously some of them are
suspicious enough to form a resistance.

16:49.740 --> 16:52.230
You're talking about a handful of people
compared to millions

16:52.340 --> 16:56.280
who wouldn't know the truth
if it was standing right in front of them.

16:56.410 --> 16:59.280
It's all lies and propaganda,
as far as they're concerned.

16:59.550 --> 17:03.610
We're wrong. They're right.
They're good. We're bad.

17:03.720 --> 17:05.740
We must worship the Ori or die,

17:05.850 --> 17:09.950
and they will fight
until we are dead or they are. Period.

17:15.360 --> 17:17.130
I'm very sorry to keep you waiting.

17:18.200 --> 17:19.860
Where is Dr. Jackson?

17:20.000 --> 17:22.730
He's otherwise occupied at the moment.

17:22.840 --> 17:24.860
We're going to have to proceed
without him.

17:24.970 --> 17:29.140
It's no matter.
I only asked he be here as a courtesy,

17:29.510 --> 17:33.450
seeing as he negotiated the original treaty
between our two countries,

17:33.550 --> 17:36.680
resulting in Russia
loaning you our stargate.

17:36.780 --> 17:40.880
Yes, loaning, in return for full participation
in this program

17:40.990 --> 17:43.050
and considerable sums of money.

17:43.160 --> 17:47.090
I am aware of that.
As I said, I only asked for this meeting

17:47.190 --> 17:49.590
out of courtesy to you and Dr. Jackson.

17:49.760 --> 17:53.630
You have been admirable comrades
in our cooperative efforts.

17:53.730 --> 17:58.360
However, official notification has been
given to your president as we speak.

17:58.470 --> 17:59.440
Of what?

17:59.540 --> 18:03.070
Well, as you know, the treaty renewal
comes up in two weeks.

18:03.180 --> 18:06.700
Russia will no longer be participating
under the current structure.

18:06.950 --> 18:09.470
-What are you saying?
-I'm saying

18:10.520 --> 18:12.680
we are taking our stargate back.

18:18.790 --> 18:22.730
VALA: So, this girl in the bar,
her name was Denya,

18:23.000 --> 18:25.120
and we struck up a bit of a friendship.

18:26.230 --> 18:28.360
By the looks on your faces,
I can see you're not surprised

18:28.470 --> 18:30.200
I had more in common
with a village harlot

18:30.300 --> 18:33.170
than I did with any of the ladies
from the local knitting circle.

18:34.010 --> 18:35.740
Don't know what you're talking about.

18:37.680 --> 18:39.370
At least she was honest.

18:39.950 --> 18:42.440
-I was pregnant once.
-Really?

18:43.780 --> 18:46.480
-lt didn't last long.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

18:48.220 --> 18:50.590
Hey, I heard something really weird.

18:51.090 --> 18:52.790
I promise you, I've heard it all.

18:52.890 --> 18:54.720
Well, have you ever heard
of someone getting pregnant

18:54.830 --> 18:56.520
without actually doing the deed?

18:57.000 --> 18:59.300
-How could that happen?
-I don't know.

18:59.570 --> 19:02.900
Maybe you fell asleep, you know?
That's happened to me before.

19:03.140 --> 19:05.130
I've been drunk
and not remembered whole days.

19:06.710 --> 19:08.370
I wasn't talking about me.

19:10.610 --> 19:13.380
No, I was just wondering if you ever heard

19:13.480 --> 19:16.350
of the Ori giving someone
a baby magically.

19:17.720 --> 19:21.020
-They perform miracles all the time, right?
-lf you say so.

19:22.720 --> 19:25.920
VALA: She's smart, too.
She was testing me.

19:27.460 --> 19:30.020
Are you saying she was part
of the anti-Ori underground?

19:30.130 --> 19:32.560
Took a long time to get her to admit it.

19:33.330 --> 19:36.130
She said she was afraid of Seevis
and that he'd kill her if he found out.

19:37.400 --> 19:38.700
MAN: Bring them this way!

19:38.840 --> 19:40.200
What do you want?

19:41.980 --> 19:43.270
(GRUNTS)

19:44.240 --> 19:47.440
Take your hands off me!

19:48.880 --> 19:52.440
-So, what did I do?
-She is unholy.

19:53.620 --> 19:58.150
She conspires with those
who would lead us from the path of Origin.

19:58.260 --> 20:00.750
I don't know who you've been talking to,
but it's a lie.

20:00.860 --> 20:04.890
She is an unbeliever,
and she must be punished for her sins.

20:16.610 --> 20:18.640
-Get me Richard Woolsey now.
-General.

20:18.750 --> 20:21.240
Where are the rest of the
international committee representatives?

20:21.350 --> 20:24.040
-Why aren't they here?
-This has nothing to do with them.

20:24.150 --> 20:27.310
-I think it does.
-The stargate belongs to Russia.

20:27.820 --> 20:30.420
Now, in the past,
my government has been unwilling

20:30.520 --> 20:33.020
to establish and support
a stargate program of its own,

20:33.130 --> 20:36.650
-but that has changed.
-Because China is backing you.

20:37.530 --> 20:39.290
Do the rest of the committee members
know this?

20:39.400 --> 20:41.890
They will be invited to participate
in the program

20:42.000 --> 20:45.170
the same as they have in yours,
as will your country.

20:45.510 --> 20:48.670
You really think my government
will give up the gate?

20:49.740 --> 20:52.370
I do not see what choice they will have.

20:59.320 --> 21:00.650
(GRUNTS)

21:01.190 --> 21:03.190
Who else in the village
has been corrupted?

21:03.290 --> 21:06.750
Apart from you,
I have no idea what you're talking about.

21:11.970 --> 21:16.730
No one shall look upon,
speak to or aid such evil.

21:18.140 --> 21:20.000
You will tell me
who you've conspired with,

21:20.110 --> 21:26.980
and the unbelievers will be found out
and punished for their sins.

21:27.850 --> 21:29.370
Hallowed are the Ori.

21:29.480 --> 21:31.950
MAN 1 : Hallowed are the Ori.
MAN 2: Hallowed are the Ori.

21:32.090 --> 21:33.520
(CROWD MURMURING)

21:44.000 --> 21:48.130
VALA: I don't know why I expected him
to come rushing over and unchain me.

21:49.170 --> 21:51.660
I'm just the mother ofhis unborn child,

21:52.510 --> 21:55.030
or so he was supposed to think.

23:03.840 --> 23:05.540
(ROARING)

23:12.320 --> 23:13.650
(GASPS)

24:00.570 --> 24:04.200
-She's dying out there.
-I know.

24:04.710 --> 24:06.700
Don't you think
if she was gonna say anything

24:06.810 --> 24:08.800
she would have told you already?

24:32.500 --> 24:35.260
VALA: I didn't know why
he eventually did it,

24:37.140 --> 24:39.230
or why Seevis Iet us go.

24:42.410 --> 24:48.010
I was left out there without food
or water for three days.

24:51.620 --> 24:53.950
I can't believe the baby survived that.

24:57.820 --> 25:00.160
Part of me was hoping it didn't.

25:03.300 --> 25:06.360
It's kind of surprising
part of you was hoping it did.

25:08.000 --> 25:12.030
I mean, given how it was conceived.

25:17.310 --> 25:18.830
It's hard to explain.

25:22.980 --> 25:23.970
Seevis...

25:25.820 --> 25:28.150
He won't bother us again, I promise you.

25:30.360 --> 25:32.120
You don't think I'm evil?

25:36.800 --> 25:39.290
I'm sorry I left you out there for so long.

25:44.070 --> 25:45.440
Please forgive me.

26:05.760 --> 26:08.190
I will see you this evening, fear not.

26:27.550 --> 26:31.710
VALA: Despite Tomin 's reassurances,
the idea of spending a day in the village

26:31.820 --> 26:34.810
with Seevis just a stone's throw away
made me nervous.

26:35.620 --> 26:38.820
Besides, it was high time
I did some more extensive recon.

27:12.290 --> 27:13.990
I knew what was happening.

27:14.530 --> 27:17.860
I knew where they were going every day,
what they were doing.

27:20.270 --> 27:23.200
Seeing it was something else entirely.

27:25.710 --> 27:27.200
Impressive, isn't it?

27:41.050 --> 27:43.450
General, you wished to see me?

27:44.060 --> 27:46.620
From the sounds of it,
the Ori are planning an invasion

27:46.730 --> 27:48.960
of massive proportions
in the very near future.

27:49.060 --> 27:51.120
Looks like it may be
a very bad time to be arguing over

27:51.230 --> 27:53.530
who gets to use the stargate, Colonel.

27:53.800 --> 27:56.460
But I assume you were counting on that.

27:56.670 --> 28:00.370
No sane individual or country wants
to face war at any time.

28:00.640 --> 28:03.040
Telling me about
your government's intentions

28:03.140 --> 28:05.340
was more than mere courtesy.

28:06.450 --> 28:09.640
Doing it with a Chinese representative
of the Oversight Committee present

28:09.750 --> 28:12.510
was meant to point out
China's involvement.

28:13.250 --> 28:16.310
That wasn't in the official notification
to terminate the treaty

28:16.420 --> 28:19.290
-given to the President.
-Obviously, it couldn't be.

28:19.830 --> 28:23.730
They offered you a deal
to back your own SGC program.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.590
In truth, you don't really know
if you like that scenario

28:26.700 --> 28:28.730
any better than the one
currently in practice.

28:28.840 --> 28:32.670
You did, however, see an opportunity
to use it as leverage.

28:36.310 --> 28:39.510
But you couldn't very well
present a wish list

28:39.610 --> 28:43.210
along with the official notification
without it looking like blackmail

28:43.320 --> 28:46.290
or have it on record
that you were merely using the Chinese,

28:46.390 --> 28:50.350
so you left it to me to figure out
and ask you the question,

28:52.460 --> 28:54.320
"What is it you really want?"

29:00.800 --> 29:01.860
Stay back.

29:01.970 --> 29:04.440
I promise,
you don't want to come any closer.

29:04.540 --> 29:06.940
-You can put that down.
-It's okay.

29:08.940 --> 29:12.710
-We had to put you through that.
-To be sure that we could trust you.

29:24.260 --> 29:28.220
-He was part of the underground?
-Seevis is the leader.

29:29.460 --> 29:32.060
The religious pomp and circumstance
is a cover.

29:32.170 --> 29:34.790
The rest is for money,
power and influence,

29:34.900 --> 29:38.230
the things you need when you're wanting
to mount a rebellion.

29:39.070 --> 29:41.730
Do they not fear
being discovered by the Ori?

29:41.840 --> 29:44.640
Of course, but the only
other choice is to do nothing.

29:45.380 --> 29:47.970
What they were planning
was quite the opposite ofnothing.

29:48.080 --> 29:52.210
We have the plans and we have
many people down there on the inside.

29:54.020 --> 29:56.510
-You really think it can work?
-lt has to.

30:02.200 --> 30:04.600
The ships had
to be activated by the Priors,

30:04.700 --> 30:06.960
but Seevis said he'd found a way
to rig enough of them

30:07.070 --> 30:09.330
to start off a massive chain reaction.

30:09.940 --> 30:11.460
From what I could tell,

30:11.570 --> 30:13.100
it Iooked Iike it might work.

30:13.210 --> 30:16.000
Three days from now,
in a grand celebration,

30:16.280 --> 30:19.610
each Prior will activate a ship
in a show of the Ori's power.

30:20.680 --> 30:22.240
Everyone will be there.

30:22.350 --> 30:25.880
All those who built the ships as well
as those who will soon board them

30:25.990 --> 30:30.010
and go off and fight in the name of the Ori.
Tens of thousands.

30:31.490 --> 30:33.550
You're going to kill all of them?

30:34.560 --> 30:38.790
Gods cannot be gods without those
who stand beneath them gazing upwards.

30:41.300 --> 30:43.460
VALA: They were gonna try
and undermine the Ori's power

30:43.570 --> 30:47.900
by eliminating as many of their followers
as they could in one fell swoop.

30:50.180 --> 30:53.370
Something I'm not sure
we would've done in their position.

30:57.580 --> 30:58.980
Shut the windows.

30:59.420 --> 31:00.750
VALA: They trusted me.

31:01.150 --> 31:03.710
Granted, they nearly killed me
so I could earn their trust,

31:03.820 --> 31:06.590
but at this point,
I felt I had to take a chance.

31:12.130 --> 31:13.570
(CLATTERING)

31:17.400 --> 31:20.430
I told them exactly who I was
and how I'd gotten there.

31:24.480 --> 31:26.600
The communication terminal
and the stones

31:26.710 --> 31:28.540
had been taken by the Prior to Celestis

31:28.650 --> 31:30.780
after Daniel and l
had been caught using them.

31:30.880 --> 31:32.580
How did Seevis get his hands on it?

31:32.690 --> 31:36.140
Apparently, he has spies among
the monks in the city of Celestis.

31:36.260 --> 31:38.750
They're humans in training
to become Priors.

31:39.160 --> 31:42.750
Every now and then,
artifacts which predate the Ori Ascension

31:42.860 --> 31:45.730
are found or dug up, deemed heretical

31:46.100 --> 31:48.860
and then brought to the city
to be burned in the fires.

31:48.970 --> 31:50.800
When the communication
terminal came through,

31:50.900 --> 31:55.200
Seevis' men recognized its significance,
and they risked everything

31:55.310 --> 31:57.780
to save it and smuggle it out of the city.

31:59.280 --> 32:01.840
So it appears
that Daniel's crazy little speech

32:01.950 --> 32:05.980
about communication from another galaxy
did not fall entirely on deaf ears.

32:06.090 --> 32:07.070
And the Ori didn't know?

32:07.190 --> 32:10.350
They couldn't tell what was happening
right underneath their noses?

32:10.460 --> 32:11.580
Can't be sure,

32:11.690 --> 32:13.720
but Seevis didn't want me
to try and contact you

32:13.830 --> 32:15.950
until after the sabotage plan
had gone through.

32:16.060 --> 32:19.400
-ln case the Ori detected it.
-Just to be safe.

32:26.340 --> 32:27.430
Vala?

32:32.410 --> 32:33.470
Vala.

32:34.410 --> 32:39.750
PRlOR: Blessed are those
who follow the path in unison.

32:42.590 --> 32:43.720
Prior.

32:49.700 --> 32:51.990
Your wife is not at home, Tomin.

32:52.100 --> 32:54.460
-She must be at market.
-Must she?

32:55.300 --> 32:57.770
To what do I owe
the honor of such a visit?

32:58.140 --> 33:01.110
Word of your courage has spread.

33:02.440 --> 33:06.570
If you refer to my unchaining of Vala,
I believe Seevis accused her unjustly.

33:06.750 --> 33:08.440
For she is not corrupt.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.510
Surely, the Ori would not have allowed her

33:10.620 --> 33:13.280
to have survived so long
without food or water.

33:14.190 --> 33:15.650
They sent her to me.

33:15.960 --> 33:18.860
She is my wife,
the mother of my unborn child.

33:18.960 --> 33:20.290
Is she now?

33:22.660 --> 33:25.600
The injury that crippled you
since childhood,

33:26.630 --> 33:31.130
the one I have cured you of
to make you a strong, proud warrior...

33:31.370 --> 33:33.200
Trust I will use the strength
I've been given

33:33.310 --> 33:35.500
to fight all unbelievers
in the name of the Ori.

33:35.610 --> 33:36.630
Yes.

33:37.240 --> 33:40.110
But the same wound that made you lame

33:40.880 --> 33:44.110
also made you unable to father children.

33:44.880 --> 33:46.110
But then...

34:04.940 --> 34:09.930
-Are you saying she betrayed me?
-The child is the will of the Ori.

34:10.640 --> 34:12.630
That is all that matters.

34:13.850 --> 34:18.440
Your courage will be rewarded, Tomin.
Fear not.

34:22.690 --> 34:25.990
Hallowed are the children of the Ori.

34:27.130 --> 34:28.820
Hallowed are the Ori.

34:52.420 --> 34:53.650
VALA: Don't go.

34:59.630 --> 35:01.990
Today is the day we've been waiting for.

35:02.230 --> 35:04.890
Ten Priors from Celestis come
to bless the starcraft

35:05.000 --> 35:07.520
we have been building
these past many months.

35:09.240 --> 35:11.000
-I know.
-Everyone is going.

35:11.240 --> 35:15.170
Everyone, even the women and children.
Of course, I did not expect you...

35:16.410 --> 35:18.100
I know you've been tired,

35:19.050 --> 35:22.040
but it is going to be a great day,
if you wanna come.

35:27.650 --> 35:28.810
Please.

35:30.420 --> 35:32.120
Stay with me today.

35:42.140 --> 35:43.970
I have a bad feeling.

35:45.170 --> 35:47.070
I can't explain it.

35:49.080 --> 35:51.410
Don't you ever just get bad feelings?

35:51.510 --> 35:52.980
Of course I do,

35:54.150 --> 35:56.510
and I turn to the Ori for guidance.

35:59.320 --> 36:01.880
-Tomin...
-The day of reckoning

36:02.590 --> 36:05.650
for all those who were raised by evil
is upon them.

36:05.830 --> 36:07.820
I have spent my whole life
waiting for the chance

36:07.930 --> 36:09.790
to walk the path as I do now.

36:10.730 --> 36:13.390
My only hope is
that you would walk it with me.

36:22.880 --> 36:25.310
Blessed are those who walk in unison.

36:35.150 --> 36:39.560
-When you say "day of reckoning"...
-We've heard numerous reports

36:39.660 --> 36:42.220
of the Priors in this galaxy
warning of an impending doomsday.

36:42.330 --> 36:46.260
A day when all who have renounced
the Ori will feel their wrath.

36:47.530 --> 36:49.870
We knew the Priors
were just the first wave.

36:49.970 --> 36:54.200
The real crusade is about to begin.
The ships are planning to leave.

36:56.780 --> 36:57.770
But that would mean...

36:57.880 --> 37:00.810
Somewhere out there
the Ori have a working supergate.

37:09.390 --> 37:11.720
VALA: Turns out the horrible feeling
I'd Iied to Tomin about

37:11.820 --> 37:15.320
was completely justified,
but for a different reason.

37:16.160 --> 37:19.530
Thousands of men, women and children
did not die that day.

37:19.900 --> 37:21.760
Seevis 'plan failed.

37:24.870 --> 37:26.600
(LOUD CHEERING)

37:31.780 --> 37:33.040
It didn 't work.

37:33.610 --> 37:35.550
The sabotage had broken down.

37:35.650 --> 37:37.140
Whether the Ori had detected it

37:37.250 --> 37:40.280
or the Priors managed to thwart it
on their own, we don 't know.

37:40.390 --> 37:43.840
AII we know is that the ships came to Iife
and nothing happened,

37:43.960 --> 37:46.390
except the crowd cheered
and began prostrating,

37:46.490 --> 37:49.460
praying for a swift victory
over all unbelievers.

37:50.860 --> 37:53.530
Do you have any other intel we could use?

37:53.630 --> 37:56.230
You said that Seevis had access
to the specs on the ships.

37:56.340 --> 37:58.700
-What kind of weaponry do they have?
-And shields.

37:58.800 --> 38:00.500
And anything on the power source
they're using.

38:00.610 --> 38:01.970
No. No, l...

38:09.520 --> 38:11.880
-Guys, what's going on?
-Jackson?

38:13.820 --> 38:16.340
-How did I get here?
-The emulator is still running.

38:16.460 --> 38:18.320
Something must have happened
on Vala's end.

38:32.740 --> 38:34.300
(GASPING)

38:45.450 --> 38:46.420
Tomin.

38:46.520 --> 38:48.890
You said you did not think
I could kill an unbeliever.

38:48.990 --> 38:51.250
Well, I'm so sorry I was wrong.

38:52.730 --> 38:54.630
-You have to listen to me.
-No!

38:54.730 --> 38:57.530
I am deaf to all
but the teachings of Origin!

38:59.730 --> 39:02.960
The Prior told me Seevis was corrupt,

39:03.400 --> 39:06.840
that he tried to sabotage the ceremony
and would've killed thousands.

39:06.940 --> 39:09.970
He sent me to kill Seevis,
and here I found you with him

39:10.080 --> 39:12.200
conspiring over that device!

39:13.180 --> 39:14.700
They made me do it.

39:20.320 --> 39:22.950
They told me they would kill me
if I didn't help them,

39:23.060 --> 39:26.050
and after what they did to me out there,
wouldn't you?

39:27.590 --> 39:30.490
They thought this device
was for communication,

39:30.600 --> 39:32.560
but they were too afraid
to use it themselves.

39:32.670 --> 39:35.600
So they kidnapped me
and forced me to do it for them.

39:38.170 --> 39:42.470
Did the Prior tell you I was with them?
Did he tell you to kill me?

39:42.580 --> 39:45.640
-No.
-Well, there you go, then.

39:47.210 --> 39:50.440
Were you able to communicate
with the unbelievers far away?

39:50.620 --> 39:54.280
Yes, and there is much I can tell you

39:54.450 --> 39:57.620
about them if you just put
that weapon down.

40:01.930 --> 40:04.520
Tomin, you have to believe me. Please.

40:11.140 --> 40:14.370
I overheard your conversation
with the Prior the other day.

40:16.380 --> 40:19.440
I know, I'm sorry.
I should have told you I was there.

40:20.110 --> 40:23.550
But I was so afraid.
What he said shocked me.

40:24.780 --> 40:28.150
That this child is the will of the Ori?

40:32.730 --> 40:37.220
Tomin, I swear I have not betrayed you.

40:37.330 --> 40:40.390
I have not been with anyone but you.

40:41.400 --> 40:46.600
So if you truly cannot father a child,
then this baby is a miracle.

40:47.170 --> 40:51.610
It's our miracle, and this a great burden
which I cannot bear alone.

40:51.810 --> 40:55.210
So from this point on,
we must walk the path together.

41:04.660 --> 41:08.350
-I must leave soon for war.
-Then I must come with you.

41:19.770 --> 41:21.140
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

41:30.280 --> 41:32.580
So, what exactly
did we have to give up in the end?

41:32.690 --> 41:35.420
-304.
-Really?

41:36.590 --> 41:38.390
I'm surprised the President agreed to that.

41:38.490 --> 41:40.860
Colonel Chekov's had his eye
on one for a while.

41:40.960 --> 41:43.220
The latest was just about to roll out.

41:43.330 --> 41:44.990
I thought the next Daedalus-class ship

41:45.100 --> 41:47.220
wasn't due out of the pipeline
for over a year.

41:47.330 --> 41:50.460
It was a huge concession,
but we didn't have much choice.

41:51.700 --> 41:56.510
CARTER: Sir, the Tok'ra and the Asgard
are scanning for any subspace anomalies

41:56.610 --> 41:58.770
that would indicate supergate activity.

41:58.880 --> 42:02.580
We're monitoring the existing black holes
that we know of, but it's a big galaxy.

42:02.680 --> 42:04.910
And as we know,
the Ori could have built another one.

42:05.020 --> 42:06.950
The lnterim Council
have placed Ha'tak-class vessels

42:07.050 --> 42:08.540
in every region on high alert.

42:08.650 --> 42:11.020
This is one needle in a haystack
we'd better find.

42:11.120 --> 42:12.390
Do whatever you have to do.

42:12.490 --> 42:14.620
If the Ori can send troops and ships here,

42:14.730 --> 42:16.490
we're gonna need
every advantage we can find.

42:16.600 --> 42:18.690
Merlin was working
on a weapon to fight the Ori.

42:18.800 --> 42:20.430
Every ally we have
and everyone else in this base

42:20.530 --> 42:23.300
has already devoted themselves
to finding the supergate.

42:23.400 --> 42:26.630
Sir, it won't take us long
to search one planet

42:26.740 --> 42:30.610
where there may be an advanced weapon
designed specifically to fight these guys.

42:30.710 --> 42:33.040
This weapon won't help us
against their followers.

42:33.150 --> 42:34.170
I don't think so, no,

42:34.280 --> 42:37.510
but it'll be a lot easier convincing
their followers their gods are false

42:37.620 --> 42:39.780
if their gods aren't around anymore.

42:39.890 --> 42:42.010
-Go.
-Thank you, sir.
