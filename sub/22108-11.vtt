00:19.672 --> 00:22.273
So, last day of school
before spring break.

00:22.308 --> 00:23.640
You kids excited?

00:23.665 --> 00:25.208
I am. I mean, because you'll be working

00:25.233 --> 00:26.670
in the restaurant even more.

00:26.695 --> 00:28.146
Whoo-hoo.

00:28.181 --> 00:30.214
Is that the sound you
make when you're happy?

00:30.250 --> 00:31.476
It's horrible.

00:31.501 --> 00:32.795
This spring break, I
want to finally earn

00:32.819 --> 00:34.710
my Thundergirls Something
Thunderful badge.

00:34.735 --> 00:37.021
It's for "exemplifying
the Thundergirl spirit

00:37.056 --> 00:39.390
with an act of outstanding
generosity or kindness."

00:39.415 --> 00:40.725
Whatever, hippie.

00:40.760 --> 00:42.126
But I can't seem to find

00:42.162 --> 00:43.828
the right Thunderful project.

00:53.706 --> 00:56.240
I'm not going this way!

00:56.276 --> 00:57.942
Come on, this is happening.

00:57.977 --> 00:59.531
Police!

01:00.004 --> 01:02.237
I guess you might call
this badge my Moby Dick.

01:02.262 --> 01:03.851
I'll call anything Moby Dick.

01:03.876 --> 01:05.147
- Moby Dick.
- Gene.

01:05.173 --> 01:07.051
Hey, Gene, how's that loose molar?

01:07.086 --> 01:09.273
You feeling like maybe
today's the day, are you?

01:09.298 --> 01:10.588
It feels pretty ready.

01:10.623 --> 01:12.356
But it's got a mind of its own.

01:12.392 --> 01:14.058
Ugh, I can't stand the waiting.

01:14.093 --> 01:15.860
Let me wiggle it.

01:15.895 --> 01:18.596
I saw her do this to a woman
at the grocery store once.

01:18.631 --> 01:20.398
It's Gene's last baby tooth.

01:20.433 --> 01:22.099
When I get it, I'll have the full set.

01:22.135 --> 01:24.502
Remind me again why you
collect Gene's teeth?

01:24.537 --> 01:26.404
You remember, when Gene was little,

01:26.439 --> 01:27.972
he was scared of the Tooth Fairy.

01:28.007 --> 01:29.707
You know, sneaking
into his room at night

01:29.742 --> 01:31.676
when he's sleeping, and taking stuff.

01:31.711 --> 01:34.078
If that's what I wanted,
I'd get an ex-girlfriend.

01:34.113 --> 01:36.948
So Gene started giving me the
teeth, and I pay him in kisses.

01:36.983 --> 01:38.115
Rip-off.

01:38.151 --> 01:39.350
And soon I'll have 'em all.

01:39.385 --> 01:40.529
Ugh, I can't stand the waiting.

01:40.553 --> 01:41.586
- Gimme.
- Ow!

01:41.621 --> 01:43.354
Lin, let Gene eat breakfast.

01:43.389 --> 01:44.622
This is breakfast.

01:44.657 --> 01:45.940
- Nom, nom, nom, nom.
- Ow, Gene, ow.

01:47.182 --> 01:49.026
So, where's everybody
going for spring break?

01:49.051 --> 01:51.095
We're going to a place
where you can stand

01:51.164 --> 01:52.363
in four states at once.

01:52.398 --> 01:54.098
I'm gonna stand in California,

01:54.133 --> 01:56.244
Hawaii, Canada, and Chicago.

01:56.269 --> 01:57.947
I'm going on a road
trip with my grandma.

01:57.971 --> 01:59.411
She's gonna let me work the gas pedal

01:59.439 --> 02:00.697
'cause she's too weak to push it.

02:00.753 --> 02:02.230
My dad is taking us to Cooperstown.

02:02.265 --> 02:05.141
- We go every year.
- The Baseball Hall of Fame.

02:05.166 --> 02:06.334
The what?

02:06.369 --> 02:08.902
I'm going on a cruise with my
parents to Turks and Caicos.

02:08.937 --> 02:11.439
Oh, my God. Turks and Caicos?

02:11.474 --> 02:13.241
Little bit of Turks, lot of Caicos.

02:13.276 --> 02:15.758
And I'll be going to here-ish.

02:15.783 --> 02:17.123
I'm trying to earn my
Something Thunderful...

02:17.147 --> 02:18.891
Oh, you know who's gonna
be on my cruise ship?

02:18.915 --> 02:19.881
BFOTs.

02:19.916 --> 02:21.449
Boys from other towns.

02:21.484 --> 02:23.284
Tammy, you're gonna smooch a BFOT

02:23.320 --> 02:26.254
on the pointy part of the
boat just like in Titanic.

02:26.289 --> 02:28.588
I might also go to the beach and
watch seagulls fight over bread.

02:28.613 --> 02:29.924
You're not going anywhere?

02:29.959 --> 02:32.238
You're so lucky you don't mind
having a super boring life.

02:32.262 --> 02:34.012
I guess I am. Oh.

02:35.432 --> 02:38.466
I thought I liked bread,
but those seagulls love bread.

02:38.501 --> 02:40.026
Oh, my God. I think it's time.

02:40.051 --> 02:41.517
It's happening.

02:41.552 --> 02:43.485
My last baby tooth.

02:43.521 --> 02:45.688
Aah, that's not a breadcrumb!

02:45.723 --> 02:47.323
So that's the Tooth Fairy.

02:47.358 --> 02:48.856
What'll I tell Mom?

02:48.888 --> 02:51.735
Tell her it's gone to a
better place... a seagull's butt.

02:51.762 --> 02:54.496
There goes Tammy's cruise ship.

02:54.532 --> 02:56.442
At least I won't have to hear
her annoying voice for a week.

02:56.467 --> 02:58.545
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

02:58.569 --> 02:59.735
Stop, stop, stop!

02:59.770 --> 03:01.470
You forgot me!

03:01.505 --> 03:03.172
Hey, Tammy, why aren't you on the boat?

03:03.207 --> 03:04.785
I was on it, Tina.

03:04.810 --> 03:07.309
I got on with my parents,
they went to the cabin,

03:07.345 --> 03:09.012
but I got off to buy lip gloss

03:09.037 --> 03:10.591
because the boat didn't have my brands.

03:10.615 --> 03:11.981
That's lip gloss?

03:12.016 --> 03:13.649
I thought you'd always just finished

03:13.684 --> 03:15.027
eating rotisserie chicken.

03:15.052 --> 03:16.952
Daddy, it's me.

03:16.988 --> 03:19.054
Tammy, where are you? The
outfit I laid out for you

03:19.090 --> 03:21.491
- is still on the bed.
- I'm not on the boat.

03:21.516 --> 03:24.360
- I'm on the land!
- What?

03:24.395 --> 03:26.996
I need you to march up to the
captain, make your voice deeper,

03:27.031 --> 03:29.116
and tell him to turn that boat around.

03:29.141 --> 03:31.266
I'm not sure cruise
ships can turn around.

03:31.302 --> 03:33.319
They have to go around
the world or something.

03:33.344 --> 03:35.437
What am I supposed to do?

03:35.473 --> 03:36.733
Um, swim for it?

03:36.758 --> 03:38.944
It's that dot out there,
right? You can make it.

03:38.979 --> 03:40.952
- Who are you with?
- No one. Nobody.

03:40.977 --> 03:43.512
- The Belchers.
- Okay, I'll go talk to someone.

03:43.547 --> 03:44.748
You go wait at their house.

03:44.773 --> 03:46.739
It's an apartment!

03:46.804 --> 03:48.737
Oh, God. I-I'll call you right back.

03:48.772 --> 03:51.239
Uh, yeah, yeah, Tammy's here now.

03:51.275 --> 03:53.575
She's so here.

03:53.610 --> 03:56.111
Here's our problem, Bob. The
only way off the ship early

03:56.146 --> 03:58.914
is by medevac, and I get airsick.

03:58.949 --> 04:00.716
That's why we're on a
cruise to begin with.

04:00.751 --> 04:02.062
Can we get another round?

04:02.086 --> 04:03.330
Uh, so listen...

04:03.354 --> 04:05.287
we've called everyone.

04:06.120 --> 04:09.925
All your friends and family
are on different fun cruises.

04:09.960 --> 04:12.461
- Psst, Tina, down here.
- What?

04:12.496 --> 04:14.463
Ask her to stay with you.

04:14.498 --> 04:17.232
That would be generous and kind, hmm?

04:17.267 --> 04:19.334
Are you freaking kidding
me? She's a monster.

04:19.370 --> 04:22.003
That's what would make it Thunderful.

04:22.039 --> 04:24.673
- Then you take her.
- Listen, kid, do you want me or not?

04:24.708 --> 04:26.608
You know I want you. Stupid badge.

04:26.643 --> 04:28.310
Tina, honey, who are you talking to?

04:28.345 --> 04:31.747
What if Tammy stays with us?

04:31.782 --> 04:34.416
- No, thank you. -Eh.
-No. -No. - Mm-mm, mm-mm.

04:34.451 --> 04:35.851
It's the only solution.

04:35.886 --> 04:37.819
Dad, tell Tammy's dad we've got this.

04:37.855 --> 04:39.588
Tammy, welcome to our home.

04:39.623 --> 04:41.123
- Ew.
- It's not a cruise,

04:41.158 --> 04:43.540
but you might catch a stomach thing.

04:45.244 --> 04:48.516
So, Tammy, a big extra
special helping for you,

04:48.541 --> 04:49.821
- our guest.
- Nope.

04:49.846 --> 04:51.412
Uh, what's the matter with it, Tammy?

04:51.470 --> 04:53.370
Um, it rhymes with "schmeverything."

04:53.406 --> 04:56.106
No offense, but I just don't
eat food that's homemade.

04:56.142 --> 04:58.234
Could we get you 
something else, sweetie?

04:58.259 --> 04:59.992
Mm, that's okay, I'll just order in.

05:00.027 --> 05:02.759
Do places deliver here, or is
the neighborhood too dangerous?

05:02.784 --> 05:05.430
Oh, it's super safe except
for that huge unsolved murder

05:05.466 --> 05:06.698
that's gonna happen.

05:06.734 --> 05:08.937
- Tammy!
- What?

05:08.962 --> 05:11.438
Okay, every towel's on the floor.

05:11.463 --> 05:14.606
Relax. You're out of hot water,
so no one's gonna need a towel.

05:14.642 --> 05:15.773
Where's the blow-dryer?

05:15.798 --> 05:17.454
- Right there.
- I was asking

05:17.478 --> 05:18.991
for the person, not the thing.

05:19.016 --> 05:20.516
Oh, your mom blow-dries your hair?

05:20.541 --> 05:22.021
Only when my dad's out of town.

05:23.428 --> 05:25.328
I'm not doing it.

05:25.663 --> 05:27.296
There are too many tangles!

05:27.321 --> 05:29.087
Use the detangler!

05:29.123 --> 05:30.856
Ugh, what's "detangler"?

05:30.891 --> 05:33.058
I hope these sofa cushions
are comfortable, Tammy.

05:33.093 --> 05:35.027
Oh, Tina, you don't have to do that.

05:35.062 --> 05:36.640
Well, I'm just being generous
and Thunderful, and...

05:36.664 --> 05:37.874
Hey, hey, wh-what are you doing?

05:37.898 --> 05:40.265
Uh, I assume I'm sleeping here

05:40.301 --> 05:42.701
- and you're sleeping down there.
- Then why'd you say,

05:42.736 --> 05:44.536
"Oh, you don't have
to put cushions down"?

05:44.572 --> 05:46.416
I just thought you could sleep
on the floor without cushions.

05:46.440 --> 05:47.739
Okay. Um...

05:47.775 --> 05:49.775
Tammy, how's your night-farting?

05:49.810 --> 05:51.810
I don't night-fart.

05:54.381 --> 05:56.315
Dad.

05:56.350 --> 05:58.750
- Wh-Wh-What is it, Gene?
- I lost my tooth.

05:58.786 --> 06:00.419
Oh, that's good news. Lin.

06:00.454 --> 06:02.788
No, no. I lost lost it.

06:02.823 --> 06:04.222
Okay, uh, let's be calm.

06:04.258 --> 06:05.591
We'll-we'll feel her out a little.

06:05.626 --> 06:06.792
Maybe she'll be cool.

06:06.827 --> 06:08.071
What? What's up? What do you want?

06:08.095 --> 06:11.460
Uh, so, the Gene baby
tooth collection...

06:11.485 --> 06:14.066
Oh, you mean my perfect
little Gene mouth in a jar?

06:14.101 --> 06:16.179
Sometimes I talk to it. And
if I bury it in the woods,

06:16.203 --> 06:17.836
I bet a little boy would come up.

06:17.871 --> 06:19.578
- (chuckles) What about it?
- Nothing. - I forget.

06:19.603 --> 06:20.983
Hi, I'm just taking a breather.

06:21.008 --> 06:22.507
From farts. To breathe.

06:22.543 --> 06:25.110
Yeah. How are we gonna get
through this Tammy week?

06:25.153 --> 06:28.188
- Drink? - Alcohol does not
solve problems, Miss Missy.

06:28.215 --> 06:29.581
It just makes them go away.

06:29.617 --> 06:30.949
Guys, come on. We can do this.

06:30.985 --> 06:32.517
It's only four more days.

06:32.553 --> 06:34.486
Is this barf? Barf.

06:34.521 --> 06:35.988
My show's on.

06:38.792 --> 06:40.792
Why are you so bad at this?

06:40.828 --> 06:42.761
I thought I was getting better!

06:42.796 --> 06:45.057
- It's only three and a half more days.
- No, enough.

06:45.082 --> 06:46.715
We're gonna have a
little Tammy-vention.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.299
Tammy, can you come out here, please?

06:51.166 --> 06:53.472
Okay, everyone stare at me.

06:53.507 --> 06:54.840
You wear glasses?

06:54.875 --> 06:57.042
No, I wear contacts, which I am out of.

06:57.077 --> 06:58.416
So I had to put these on,

06:58.441 --> 07:00.412
and now my face is totally Tina-ed!

07:00.447 --> 07:02.514
Badge, badge, badge, badge.

07:02.549 --> 07:04.616
- Tammy, we need to talk.
- It's okay.

07:04.652 --> 07:07.019
- I think I know what this is about.
- Oh, good.

07:07.054 --> 07:10.956
Being more polite and
grateful and helpful.

07:10.991 --> 07:13.291
I know you guys
think you're doing your best,

07:13.327 --> 07:15.494
but you could work on
all three of these things.

07:15.529 --> 07:16.795
Oh, my God.

07:16.830 --> 07:18.730
Tammy, we're not a hotel.

07:18.766 --> 07:20.428
Yeah, and we're not a restaurant.

07:20.453 --> 07:22.668
- Right.
- Actually, we are a restaurant.

07:22.703 --> 07:23.802
But not a good one.

07:23.837 --> 07:25.804
Right. I-I mean, the point is,

07:25.839 --> 07:28.140
Tammy, in our house, kids help out.

07:28.175 --> 07:31.043
And we think you might kind
of appreciate other people

07:31.078 --> 07:33.675
and things, uh, if you
pitched in a little.

07:33.700 --> 07:34.980
You know, work.

07:35.015 --> 07:36.316
Work?

07:36.341 --> 07:38.183
Like, where?

07:38.218 --> 07:39.562
So I think you'll like working here.

07:39.586 --> 07:42.254
- My coworkers are pretty fun.
- Mom's the office flirt.

07:42.289 --> 07:44.690
She does get a little grabby
at the Christmas party.

07:44.725 --> 07:45.824
That's true.

07:45.859 --> 07:47.726
This isn't happening.

07:47.761 --> 07:49.661
I hate to haze you on
your first day but, uh,

07:49.697 --> 07:51.163
mind passing me that ketchup?

07:51.198 --> 07:52.931
- What?
- It's the red bottle right there.

07:52.966 --> 07:54.724
- I'm sorry, I'm just not...
- Right-right by your hand.

07:54.749 --> 07:56.660
Sorry. Okay. Actually,
if you could start over.

07:56.685 --> 07:58.003
- Right...
- You may even be touching it.

07:58.038 --> 07:59.949
- Just put your fing... right behind...
- I just... I... I don't...

07:59.973 --> 08:01.057
You just... you're...
you're right by it.

08:01.082 --> 08:03.075
- I...
- You know, I got mustard here.

08:03.110 --> 08:04.220
- I'm g-gonna... I'm gonna do that.
- I'm just...

08:04.244 --> 08:05.467
Yeah, I'm gonna go on break.

08:05.492 --> 08:07.579
What? Tammy, you haven't
done anything yet.

08:07.614 --> 08:09.214
This isn't the spring break

08:09.249 --> 08:10.545
I was supposed to be having.

08:10.570 --> 08:14.519
I was supposed to be
kissing BFOTs on a boat.

08:14.555 --> 08:17.089
Now I've got bad hair and glasses.

08:17.124 --> 08:18.301
Damn it, Tammy, get it together.

08:18.325 --> 08:19.365
You've lasted two minutes.

08:19.393 --> 08:20.559
This is my life.

08:20.594 --> 08:23.929
Ew!

08:25.232 --> 08:26.732
Hey, hey, hey, restaurant girl.

08:26.767 --> 08:28.100
Don't cry. What's wrong?

08:28.135 --> 08:30.702
- I just wanted to take a break.
- But...

08:30.738 --> 08:32.904
You poor dirty-faced thing.
Here's a handkerchief.

08:32.940 --> 08:35.707
I carry one in case I run
into sad humans. Or boogers.

08:35.743 --> 08:37.075
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

08:37.111 --> 08:38.767
I'm Brett, I'm picking up an order.

08:38.792 --> 08:40.879
Oh, that's coming right
up. Did you order one

08:40.914 --> 08:43.071
"grandpa style"? I-I
don't know what that is.

08:43.110 --> 08:45.217
Yeah, it's how my grandpa
orders his burgers.

08:45.252 --> 08:46.696
I guess it's just mashed up.

08:46.721 --> 08:48.987
I'm in town visiting my
grandfather this week.

08:49.022 --> 08:50.567
- Here.
- Wow, you really filled this up.

08:50.591 --> 08:51.790
I like that.

08:51.825 --> 08:53.225
At my private school in Bethesda,

08:53.260 --> 08:54.993
I never get to meet down-to-earth girls

08:55.028 --> 08:57.429
who work in restaurants
and really blow their nose.

08:57.464 --> 08:58.797
Geez, Tina.

08:58.832 --> 09:00.310
A boy comes in here looking for a girl

09:00.334 --> 09:02.011
who works in a restaurant
with lots of snot,

09:02.035 --> 09:04.169
and he doesn't meet you.

09:04.194 --> 09:06.204
Bethesda? Is that where Jesus is from?

09:06.240 --> 09:07.339
Ha. You're different.

09:07.374 --> 09:08.507
Me, too.

09:08.542 --> 09:09.908
So, same as you.

09:09.943 --> 09:11.443
Is this your family's restaurant?

09:11.478 --> 09:13.912
No, my family left me with these people.

09:13.947 --> 09:15.447
And now I work here.

09:15.482 --> 09:17.249
Technically true. I got to allow it.

09:17.274 --> 09:18.440
Here's your order.

09:18.465 --> 09:20.098
We treat Tammy very well.

09:20.123 --> 09:21.423
And now I have to go.

09:21.448 --> 09:22.914
Because I ordered this to go.

09:22.939 --> 09:24.560
I wrote my number on a napkin. Here.

09:24.585 --> 09:26.336
Oh, are we exchanging
numbers? Uh, hold on.

09:26.360 --> 09:27.704
I've got one. It's the emergency phone,

09:27.728 --> 09:29.494
but if it's, uh... oh, you're gone.

09:29.530 --> 09:32.164
Hey, it's my best
friend, Peter Pescadero.

09:32.199 --> 09:34.333
I'm gonna go give him a high five.

09:35.161 --> 09:37.502
So, you got a fresh molar for me?

09:37.538 --> 09:40.939
I did, Gene, but I got a better offer.

09:40.974 --> 09:43.341
Hogarth Haber needed a tooth
for a science experiment

09:43.377 --> 09:46.011
where you drop it in soda
and see if it dissolves.

09:46.046 --> 09:47.004
I'll pay double.

09:47.029 --> 09:48.847
Whatever double one dollar is.

09:48.882 --> 09:50.782
It's too late, Gene, it's gone.

09:50.818 --> 09:52.582
It dissolved so fast.

09:52.607 --> 09:54.686
Soda's not good, man.

09:54.721 --> 09:57.522
Okay, so, Brett's a little bit...

09:57.558 --> 09:58.957
- Perfect, I know.
- ... weird.

09:58.992 --> 10:01.193
But he's supes cute and a BFOT,

10:01.228 --> 10:03.195
and I'm going to salvage
this crap spring break

10:03.230 --> 10:04.896
by smooching him.

10:04.932 --> 10:06.631
Uh, right on schedge.

10:06.667 --> 10:09.301
"I'm smelling my burger
wrapper and thinking of you."

10:09.336 --> 10:10.635
Blah, blah, blah.

10:10.671 --> 10:13.138
"Also, how come a day can be sunny,

10:13.163 --> 10:15.897
but a night can't be moony?" Eh?

10:15.943 --> 10:17.809
That's a frickin' great text.

10:17.845 --> 10:20.722
And I will text back...

10:20.881 --> 10:22.848
An emoji of a high-heeled shoe?

10:22.883 --> 10:24.716
Tammy, you have to put
words to your feelings.

10:24.751 --> 10:26.384
Like the word "shoe"?

10:26.420 --> 10:28.031
Why don't you say, "Hi,
Brett. Do you ever think

10:28.055 --> 10:29.568
that shoulders are
the butts of the arms?"

10:29.593 --> 10:30.989
You know, normal stuff like that.

10:31.024 --> 10:32.724
"Hi, uh... "

10:32.759 --> 10:33.903
Ugh, you just write it, Tina.

10:33.927 --> 10:35.560
Me? Okay.

10:35.596 --> 10:37.896
I mean, a little extra
Thundergirl generosity, I guess.

10:37.931 --> 10:40.065
- Word it up.
- Oh, a reply.

10:40.100 --> 10:41.666
"Do you think if snakes wore pants,

10:41.702 --> 10:44.669
it would just be a sock?"

10:44.705 --> 10:46.504
Maybe I should just handle this.

10:46.540 --> 10:48.927
Oh, Brett.

10:50.611 --> 10:53.578
Tina, what are you doing?

10:53.614 --> 10:56.514
Oh, you're up. Uh,
okay, so... some news.

10:56.550 --> 10:58.250
One, you have a date with Brett. Yay.

10:58.285 --> 10:59.984
Two, you should catch
up on a couple texts.

11:00.009 --> 11:01.920
Oh, my God, there are hundreds.

11:01.955 --> 11:03.622
Yeah, you got a little carried away.

11:03.657 --> 11:06.585
"If you could be any kind of
furniture, what would it be?

11:06.610 --> 11:09.195
- I'd be a love seat"?
- I know, good stuff.

11:09.220 --> 11:10.367
I can't talk like this.

11:10.375 --> 11:11.773
How am I gonna get through this date?

11:11.798 --> 11:13.587
Brett thinks I'm this dorky weirdo.

11:13.612 --> 11:16.012
No, he doesn't, he thinks you're me. Oh.

11:16.047 --> 11:19.883
It's almost like I need to
borrow your weird personality.

11:19.951 --> 11:21.184
Wait, how would that work?

11:21.219 --> 11:22.719
You've come to the right person.

11:22.754 --> 11:24.420
Uh, we didn't come to you at all.

11:24.456 --> 11:26.100
Yeah, you just walked
in here without knocking.

11:26.124 --> 11:28.658
There wasn't time for you guys
to figure out you needed me.

11:28.693 --> 11:30.860
Fortunately, the walls are thin.

11:30.896 --> 11:33.029
I think some of your
walls are just wallpaper.

11:33.064 --> 11:34.264
We can pull this off.

11:34.299 --> 11:36.499
And all it's gonna take
is a couple telephones,

11:36.535 --> 11:39.002
ear-buds, a little luck,
big hats, potted plants,

11:39.037 --> 11:40.837
more luck, precision timing,

11:40.872 --> 11:43.406
some sort of a distraction,
and a little luck.

11:43.441 --> 11:45.152
- Sounds doable.
- Well, I wouldn't go that far.

11:45.176 --> 11:48.211
But if it doesn't work, at
least it'll fail enjoyably.

11:48.246 --> 11:51.876
If you need a distraction,
how 'bout these wubba-wubbas?

11:52.782 --> 11:54.716
Here's how it works.
You guys call each other,

11:54.751 --> 11:57.117
leave the line open.
The BFOT says something.

11:57.142 --> 11:59.586
Tammy's phone picks it
up, transmits it to Tina,

11:59.611 --> 12:01.078
bypassing Tammy's brain.

12:01.113 --> 12:02.646
Tina replies into her phone.

12:02.681 --> 12:04.981
Tammy repeats those words exactly,

12:05.017 --> 12:06.727
again bypassing Tammy's brain.

12:06.752 --> 12:08.977
At no time is Tammy's
brain used, understood?

12:09.021 --> 12:10.754
- Yes. - Not at all.
- We're ready.

12:10.789 --> 12:13.190
So that's my favorite horse movie

12:13.225 --> 12:15.587
or movie containing horses.
What about you?

12:15.612 --> 12:18.939
My favorite of those movies I've
known about way before now is...

12:18.964 --> 12:20.897
- Haunches of Glory.
- Haunches of Glory.

12:20.933 --> 12:22.265
Oh, I loved the ads.

12:22.301 --> 12:24.134
"Raise the roof for this hoof."

12:24.169 --> 12:25.669
Is that your boss' daughter in there?

12:25.704 --> 12:28.538
Ugh. Yeah, spying on me. So creepy.

12:28.574 --> 12:30.774
Gonna drag me back to work probably.

12:30.809 --> 12:33.110
Hey, she's not your slave!

12:33.145 --> 12:37.380
And that cloud looks like Gandhi...
in a gondola. Am I crazy?

12:37.416 --> 12:39.549
I got a cloud that looks
like a butt at two o'clock.

12:39.585 --> 12:41.218
What do you know? Another butt cloud.

12:41.253 --> 12:43.261
- Aah! My phone's dying.
- You're cutting out.

12:43.286 --> 12:45.922
- Hmm?
- Carbs. Or at least I am.

12:45.958 --> 12:47.791
Oh, boy, she's flying solo.

12:47.826 --> 12:50.026
So...

12:50.062 --> 12:52.696
Coo... uh, yes.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.431
Cuh-ca...

12:54.466 --> 12:56.900
I can tell that you have
so much to say. Just say it.

12:56.935 --> 12:58.535
Ugly people.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.570
Are... bad?

13:00.606 --> 13:02.806
- I don't...
- Aah! I have yogurt diarrhea. Bye!

13:02.841 --> 13:05.575
That actually went a lot
better than I thought it would.

13:06.103 --> 13:07.277
Hi, Dr. Yap.

13:07.312 --> 13:09.846
- We called about the tooth?
- Not here, Bob.

13:09.882 --> 13:12.182
The coffee shop across
the street. More privacy.

13:12.217 --> 13:13.783
- But...
- I said coffee shop.

13:13.819 --> 13:16.620
They have booths and light
jazz. It's super nice.

13:16.655 --> 13:19.122
That jazz better be damn light, buddy.

13:20.592 --> 13:22.926
- Here's my inventory.
- Aah!

13:22.961 --> 13:25.562
Where's the rest of
Michael Caine, you monster?!

13:25.597 --> 13:27.898
Oh, my God. We-we want a baby tooth.

13:27.933 --> 13:30.066
I don't extract baby teeth, Bob.

13:30.102 --> 13:32.068
I yank gross, diseased adult teeth.

13:32.137 --> 13:33.904
Uh, I guess this one, then.

13:33.939 --> 13:35.372
Ooh, you have a good eye.

13:35.407 --> 13:37.641
Smells like cigarette
smoke and Barbasol.

13:37.676 --> 13:39.142
All right, how much?

13:39.178 --> 13:40.644
- Whatever you think is fair.
- Free?

13:40.679 --> 13:42.078
Let's say 50 bucks.

13:42.114 --> 13:43.580
- I'll give you ten.
- Deal.

13:43.615 --> 13:44.814
I panicked.

13:44.850 --> 13:45.815
I didn't know what to say.

13:45.851 --> 13:47.028
I wasn't following the conversation.

13:47.052 --> 13:48.692
I thought Brett was
super easy to talk to.

13:48.720 --> 13:50.760
Especially for someone I
wasn't actually talking to.

13:50.789 --> 13:52.355
That's why we're a good team, Tina.

13:52.391 --> 13:54.591
I'm the face, you're
the gunk behind the face.

13:54.626 --> 13:57.894
But what if the gunk has
feelings for Brett, also?

13:57.930 --> 13:59.996
- I'm confused.
- I like Brett. A lot.

14:00.032 --> 14:01.665
You don't even know him, Tina.

14:01.700 --> 14:03.300
Actually, I think I do know him.

14:03.335 --> 14:05.468
You know what? Use it.
Use your dumb feelings.

14:05.504 --> 14:07.103
Get that BFOT on my kiss spot.

14:07.139 --> 14:08.638
Beautiful lady.

14:08.674 --> 14:10.040
I hope this is your bedroom.

14:10.075 --> 14:11.641
It's Brett! Ow!

14:11.677 --> 14:15.078
- Why'd you run away?
- Um... Please.

14:15.113 --> 14:17.113
This is where the Thunder-rubber

14:17.149 --> 14:20.116
meets the Thunder-road.
What's it gonna be, hotshot?

14:20.152 --> 14:22.886
I was afraid of how 
much we have in common.

14:22.921 --> 14:25.655
I was afraid of how
much sodium's in ramen?

14:25.691 --> 14:26.293
Louder!

14:26.318 --> 14:28.102
You know what? Just stand
there and move your mouth.

14:28.126 --> 14:30.360
I guess what I'm 
trying to say, Brett, is,

14:30.395 --> 14:31.962
it's a moony night.

14:31.997 --> 14:33.396
Do you sound different?

14:33.432 --> 14:35.298
Nope. Anyway, I like you,

14:35.334 --> 14:36.666
and there's just you and me here.

14:36.702 --> 14:38.902
Two hearts, two mouths.

14:38.937 --> 14:41.137
- Four lips.
- Sink ships.

14:41.173 --> 14:43.974
In the math of the
heart, that equals kiss.

14:44.009 --> 14:46.801
- How do I get up there?
- I have a fire ladder. I'll come down.

14:46.826 --> 14:49.145
Nice job, Tina.

14:51.750 --> 14:54.684
- Whoa.
- Ugh...

14:54.720 --> 14:56.854
So, are we just gonna
keep watching, or... ?

14:56.879 --> 14:58.053
Keep watching.

14:58.078 --> 15:00.441
- Okay, I'll get a chair.
- Get me one, too.

15:01.879 --> 15:05.090
Sorry, Tina. I thought this
was gonna go disastrously wrong,

15:05.129 --> 15:07.207
- not disgustingly right.
- Ugh!

15:07.232 --> 15:08.798
Where's this gonna end?

15:09.066 --> 15:10.599
- I...
- Do.

15:10.634 --> 15:11.967
- You do.
- ... do.

15:12.002 --> 15:13.468
What a great honeymoon.

15:13.504 --> 15:14.870
What a great honeymoon.

15:14.905 --> 15:16.371
Come on, push.

15:19.076 --> 15:20.642
I don't like it. I don't like it.

15:20.677 --> 15:22.611
Whew! Are my lips still on?

15:22.646 --> 15:24.112
Okay, here's the news.

15:24.148 --> 15:25.647
Brett is taking me to dinner tomorrow,

15:25.682 --> 15:27.549
and I think he's on
the verge of asking me

15:27.584 --> 15:29.217
to be his out-of-town girlfriend.

15:29.253 --> 15:30.886
Out-of-town
girlfriend. You mean... ?

15:30.931 --> 15:32.531
I'm gonna be an OOTGF!

15:32.556 --> 15:34.713
I knew you'd either end
up an astronaut or that.

15:34.738 --> 15:37.125
Here's what I need. Some
kind of smarty-boobs speech

15:37.161 --> 15:38.314
that gets him over the hump.

15:38.339 --> 15:41.407
Like, "Hey, Brett, bleep, bloo,
bluh, in conclusion, OOTGF."

15:41.432 --> 15:43.165
- Have fun with it.
- Tammy, I'm out.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.338
I can't do it anymore.

15:44.363 --> 15:46.163
Uh... excuse me?

15:46.188 --> 15:48.439
It's not fair. I think Brett likes me.

15:48.464 --> 15:49.892
You're... Milli Vanilli,

15:49.917 --> 15:51.750
and I'm those super-talented
studio musicians

15:51.775 --> 15:53.553
that probably had to sleep in
the same room as Milli Vanilli

15:53.578 --> 15:54.846
while Milli Vanilli farted up the place.

15:54.871 --> 15:57.556
Oh, step off, girl. He is mine.

15:57.581 --> 15:59.147
So you just keep away from him,

15:59.183 --> 16:00.416
and you just keep telling
me what to say to him.

16:00.441 --> 16:01.955
- I won't.
- You will.

16:01.980 --> 16:03.779
- I won't. - You...
- Will!

16:03.804 --> 16:06.721
Tina, you can't abandon
Tammy this late in the game.

16:06.757 --> 16:08.846
- That's not Thunderful.
- But...

16:08.871 --> 16:11.238
Tammy just wants you to put
some more words in her mouth.

16:11.263 --> 16:14.603
You can think up some
interesting words, right?

16:14.628 --> 16:18.110
Oh. Um, all right, I'll do it.

16:18.135 --> 16:20.268
Good. Keep it happy and snappy.

16:20.304 --> 16:22.604
This plaque's really baked on.

16:22.639 --> 16:24.330
We've just got to get it down to size.

16:24.355 --> 16:27.052
And then we go after
the mole on Dad's butt.

16:27.077 --> 16:29.711
- Gene.
- Sorry. Beauty mark on Dad's butt.

16:29.746 --> 16:31.549
Bob, what's the racket down there?

16:31.574 --> 16:35.761
Oh, we're just, uh, making...
jewelry... for your birthday.

16:35.786 --> 16:37.464
Oh, oh, I don't want to
see! I don't want to see!

16:37.488 --> 16:38.814
Uh, but when you do see it,

16:38.839 --> 16:42.267
it's gonna look store-bought
and sensibly priced.

16:42.292 --> 16:45.283
- Hi, milady. Ready for our date?
- Yeah, let's go.

16:45.308 --> 16:47.362
- And we're here.
- Welcome to Bob's Burgers.

16:47.397 --> 16:48.728
Let me show you to your table.

16:48.753 --> 16:51.043
I'm kind of surprised you
want to come here, Tammy.

16:51.068 --> 16:54.269
Tonight she's not a dirty
employee. She's a dirty guest.

16:54.304 --> 16:55.619
We can literally go anywhere else.

16:55.644 --> 16:57.806
Well, you're here, so, enjoy.

16:57.841 --> 16:59.708
I'll be your server tonight.

16:59.743 --> 17:02.705
If you need anything, especially
napkins, Tammy, let me know.

17:02.737 --> 17:04.103
Here are some to get you started.

17:04.127 --> 17:06.414
Eh? Oh.

17:06.450 --> 17:08.236
"Forget the side of fries.

17:08.261 --> 17:11.396
I want my side to be
this guy by my side."

17:11.421 --> 17:12.821
I also do want fries.

17:12.847 --> 17:14.280
It's still so yellow.

17:14.305 --> 17:15.816
We-we have to paint
it white or something.

17:15.840 --> 17:17.657
Which white? There are
a lot of whites, Bob.

17:17.683 --> 17:19.349
Don't tell a handyman you want white.

17:19.519 --> 17:21.618
I don't know. Um, tooth white?

17:21.644 --> 17:24.368
"Tooth white." Uh, l-let me,
let me get out the chips here.

17:24.394 --> 17:26.578
There's Lily White, Winter White.

17:26.603 --> 17:28.713
Ooh, Oyster Whisper?
That's a pretty one.

17:28.738 --> 17:30.603
Whatever Gene's teeth are.

17:30.628 --> 17:32.495
Or we pick a white
we're all excited about

17:32.520 --> 17:34.153
and throw a coat of
that on Gene's teeth.

17:34.178 --> 17:35.845
I want Tighty Whitey white.

17:35.870 --> 17:37.689
We're not painting Gene's mouth.

17:37.714 --> 17:39.064
Oh, boo.

17:39.089 --> 17:42.891
I'll never forget the
last few days... uh...

17:42.916 --> 17:44.349
Oops. I spilled my water.

17:44.374 --> 17:46.408
- More napkins here!
- Here we are.

17:46.433 --> 17:48.733
"And soon you'll be
going back to Bethesda."

17:49.228 --> 17:51.860
Oop. Ha. Look at that.
I spilled your water.

17:51.895 --> 17:53.528
Maybe more than one napkin this time?

17:53.564 --> 17:55.875
Tammy's really going through
the paper goods over there.

17:55.899 --> 17:57.365
She's the same with TP.

17:57.401 --> 17:58.867
She really lays down a nest.

17:58.902 --> 18:01.436
"Soon, I'll be out of town from you."

18:01.471 --> 18:03.104
That's a weird way to say that.

18:03.140 --> 18:04.213
I love it.

18:04.238 --> 18:05.596
You do? Uh...

18:05.621 --> 18:07.488
"But what if I had a
totally different face?"

18:07.513 --> 18:10.011
Super cool hypothetical.

18:10.047 --> 18:13.381
"And even if I was slightly
taller than you thought I was

18:13.417 --> 18:15.383
"and I didn't put on eye shadow

18:15.419 --> 18:17.892
like I was frosting a
fricking wedding cake... "

18:17.917 --> 18:19.821
What the hell is going on here?

18:19.856 --> 18:21.456
Yeah, I'm not sure what you're saying.

18:21.491 --> 18:23.792
I'm sure I'm gonna say
something different in a minute.

18:23.827 --> 18:25.994
As soon as I get a new napkin over here!

18:26.028 --> 18:27.614
I'm really sorry. It looks
like we're out of napkins.

18:27.639 --> 18:30.122
Well, that's kind of a
problem for me now because...

18:30.147 --> 18:32.528
I... need... one!

18:32.553 --> 18:35.221
- That is a huge mess.
- She really is.

18:35.246 --> 18:37.046
Ah, forget it. I'm out.

18:37.071 --> 18:39.017
I'm out, too, Brett... of the closet.

18:39.042 --> 18:41.376
The whole time you were
talking to me, not Tammy.

18:41.411 --> 18:43.122
What do you mean, grumpy napkin girl?

18:43.147 --> 18:44.714
I've been speaking to you through her,

18:44.739 --> 18:47.006
and now you and I are
together. Hi, I'm Tina.

18:47.037 --> 18:50.539
This whole thing...
It was a Cyrano de Burger-ac!

18:50.574 --> 18:52.808
Cyra-yes de Burger-ac.

18:52.843 --> 18:55.082
- I... I'm kind of upset.
- I get it.

18:55.107 --> 18:57.813
Let's just go walk on the
beach and talk, mouth to mouth.

18:57.848 --> 19:00.349
I told my grandpa about you. I mean her.

19:00.384 --> 19:01.817
- I mean...
- Shh, shh, shh.

19:01.852 --> 19:03.852
- You're all up in here.
- You guys tricked me.

19:03.887 --> 19:05.220
Okay, you know what? Frankly,

19:05.256 --> 19:06.888
you didn't have to
be that easy to trick.

19:06.924 --> 19:09.458
What? You know, this stuff
doesn't happen in Bethesda.

19:09.493 --> 19:11.360
People there just say their own words.

19:11.395 --> 19:13.395
What about when Tammy's
voice changed completely?

19:13.430 --> 19:14.796
You just kind of went with that,

19:14.832 --> 19:16.198
Mr. Handsome Hears What He Wants.

19:16.233 --> 19:17.532
Guys, guys?

19:17.568 --> 19:19.167
Woof. I have something to say.

19:19.203 --> 19:21.169
And these are my actual words, I think.

19:21.205 --> 19:23.138
You seem to have some gross chemistry,

19:23.173 --> 19:24.740
and you both make me tired, so

19:24.775 --> 19:26.675
just go walk together
on the beach already.

19:26.978 --> 19:29.077
I... guess it wouldn't kill us.

19:29.113 --> 19:31.258
Great. Let's go. I got my coat
on while Tammy was talking.

19:31.282 --> 19:33.315
Oh, I'm actually working tonight.

19:33.350 --> 19:36.251
Ugh! I'll...

19:36.287 --> 19:38.053
... do nasty restaurant
stuff for you, Tina.

19:38.088 --> 19:39.755
Thanks, Tammy. Maybe you're the one

19:39.790 --> 19:41.523
that deserves a Something
Thunderful badge.

19:41.558 --> 19:44.059
- Who cares? That thing is stupid.
- Good. Phew.

19:44.101 --> 19:46.001
All right, hand me that dish loofah.

19:46.030 --> 19:48.597
- This is a sponge.
- What are you saying?

19:48.632 --> 19:50.599
- "Spawnge"?
- Sponge!

19:50.634 --> 19:51.933
Spawnge.

19:51.969 --> 19:53.402
Gene.

19:53.437 --> 19:55.937
Oh, what have we here?

19:55.973 --> 19:58.273
Oh. Oh, my God, is it time? Is it time?!

19:58.309 --> 19:59.708
I just lost my last...

20:01.278 --> 20:03.378
- I think he swallowed it.
- Swallowed it?!

20:03.414 --> 20:05.514
- Oh, my God, Gene!
- Oh, boy.

20:05.549 --> 20:07.182
I ate a dead man's tooth!

20:07.217 --> 20:09.284
Now I'm gonna take on his personality.

20:09.320 --> 20:11.186
Get me some smokes. I want bourbon.

20:11.221 --> 20:12.754
Wait. What's going on?

20:12.790 --> 20:15.357
Um, we bought a dead man's tooth.

20:15.392 --> 20:18.203
- Maybe not dead, but not well.
- Why?

20:18.228 --> 20:20.885
Because Gene lost lost
his last baby tooth,

20:20.910 --> 20:22.431
and we didn't know how to tell you.

20:22.466 --> 20:23.943
Please don't write me out of your will.

20:23.967 --> 20:27.269
- I want those sweaters!
- Oh, it's okay, Gene.

20:27.304 --> 20:30.105
I was... missing a few
of your teeth anyway.

20:30.140 --> 20:31.873
- What?
- It's hard to keep a full set.

20:31.909 --> 20:34.042
You know, you take 'em
out and play with them,

20:34.078 --> 20:35.711
they get lost. It's like Legos.

20:35.746 --> 20:38.983
Oh, my God, we spent
so much time on this.

20:39.647 --> 20:41.550
Looks like the ocean's out tonight.

20:41.585 --> 20:43.485
Hey, look, it's waving at you.

20:43.520 --> 20:45.397
Damn, we're gonna kiss.

20:46.357 --> 20:47.634
Oh, my God,

20:47.658 --> 20:49.747
did that seagull just cough up a tooth?

20:49.772 --> 20:51.405
Oh, uh, let me get that for my mom.

20:51.430 --> 20:53.407
- What?
- No, it can wait.
