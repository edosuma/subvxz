02:04.625 --> 02:07.251
Byron!

02:58.679 --> 03:00.638
I don't even like
coming into doctors' offices.

03:00.722 --> 03:03.182
I don't get sick ever. I don't never get sick.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.685
- You know that.
- Well, thank you for coming with me.

03:05.894 --> 03:09.313
You're welcome, honey.
You know I'm always on your side, honey.

03:09.398 --> 03:11.732
I just don't get sick. I don't never get sick.

03:11.859 --> 03:15.736
You're... You sick, but I don't get sick.
I'm sorry.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.780
- You nervous, honey?
- No.

03:17.906 --> 03:19.615
It's gonna be whatever it's gonna be.

03:19.741 --> 03:21.826
Your mama taught you well, baby.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.412
You got strong faith, Shirley, strong faith.

03:24.496 --> 03:25.788
Hello.

03:26.582 --> 03:28.749
Good God. Lord have mercy.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.793
Good God, he fine.

03:31.962 --> 03:33.004
Doc, I'm sick.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.047
It's in my chest, Doc.
Feel my chest. Come on.

03:35.132 --> 03:37.174
Put your hands on my chest, Doc. Feel me.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.385
Check my chest, Doc, please. I'm...

03:39.595 --> 03:41.512
Aunt Bam. Stop it.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.056
She's cute.

03:44.224 --> 03:47.184
Cute? Cute is for puppies.

03:47.853 --> 03:52.189
You mess with me, Doc, I'll have you
somewhere sucking on your thumb,

03:52.274 --> 03:54.108
calling for your mama!

03:54.985 --> 03:57.987
Standing on your left leg,
bowing down on your right,

03:58.071 --> 04:00.197
wondering what I'm gonna do
to you tonight.

04:03.660 --> 04:07.163
Pop, pop, pop it off...

04:08.999 --> 04:11.292
- You married, Doc?
- No, ma'am.

04:12.878 --> 04:14.629
- You straight?
- Aunt Bam...

04:14.796 --> 04:17.882
What? You gotta ask
these questions nowadays, honey.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.135
Will you please wait
out in the waiting room?

04:22.053 --> 04:24.180
- Please?
- I'm embarrassing you?

04:24.306 --> 04:26.557
I'm sorry, baby. I don't mean no harm.
Help me up, Doc.

04:26.642 --> 04:28.517
Just help me up. I gotta bend up like this.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.144
You see, Doc, listen, I don't even get sick.

04:30.228 --> 04:32.438
I don't even like
coming into doctors' offices.

04:32.522 --> 04:36.525
'Cause all y'all like to do is just probe
all over people, feeling, touch all of them...

04:36.693 --> 04:38.819
Two, four, six-pack.

04:39.404 --> 04:40.738
Look at that?

04:41.740 --> 04:44.158
What? Sorry.
Okay, and look, look at your little offices.

04:44.242 --> 04:48.037
This is too small in here.
Ain't no room for nobody to turn around.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.831
See, I like to turn it.
When I turn it around I like to...

04:51.667 --> 04:53.125
- He's straight.
- Aunt Bam.

04:55.671 --> 04:58.673
Okay. But look here, watch this, watch this.

04:59.174 --> 05:02.134
Did you like that? I know he did, look at him.

05:02.260 --> 05:04.428
- Aunt Bam, go on, now.
- You blushing. Okay, I'm sorry.

05:04.513 --> 05:06.055
And don't you be out there smoking.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.933
You better be worried about
what I'm gonna be out here smoking.

05:09.017 --> 05:12.478
'Cause I'm gonna be out here smoking.
I'm going out here to smoke.

05:12.604 --> 05:16.649
And I like what I'm gonna be smoking.
I like to see my name in puff.

05:16.858 --> 05:18.985
She's something else.

05:19.861 --> 05:22.196
You don't know the half of it.

05:23.115 --> 05:25.032
So tell me, Dr. Evans.

05:25.409 --> 05:28.869
Well, Ms. Shirley,
I hate to be the bearer of bad news.

05:29.246 --> 05:30.746
Just tell me.

05:32.040 --> 05:35.126
The reason you've been short of breath
and having the headaches

05:35.210 --> 05:37.128
is because the cancer is back.

05:37.212 --> 05:40.047
It's much more aggressive this time.
I'm sorry.

05:40.465 --> 05:43.592
I've called in a specialist who wants to try
another round of chemotherapy.

05:43.844 --> 05:46.095
Listen, I'm tired.

05:46.179 --> 05:49.640
We've been fighting this thing for, what,
seven years?

05:50.892 --> 05:53.269
I really thought we had it beat.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.104
Don't you look so sad.

05:55.439 --> 05:59.483
What I know is that
every day that God gives us is a gift.

06:00.610 --> 06:04.572
And when he stops giving it to me,
then I get to be with him.

06:06.241 --> 06:08.409
So it's all right.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.287
You're an amazing woman, Shirley.

06:11.663 --> 06:13.539
You're always smiling.

06:14.374 --> 06:15.958
Your faith gives me hope.

06:16.168 --> 06:18.210
Well, God bless you.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.588
I'll call and make an appointment. Okay?

06:21.256 --> 06:22.548
Thank you, Doctor.

06:22.758 --> 06:25.926
Good kush, good kush,
good kush, good kush.

06:26.094 --> 06:27.762
Good kush, good kush.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.141
Hey. Christ, praise the Lord.

06:33.351 --> 06:35.436
Good kush.

06:38.523 --> 06:41.609
Baby, I wouldn't go in there.
I wouldn't go in there if I was you, hon.

06:42.652 --> 06:43.652
I told you.

06:44.279 --> 06:45.279
Contact.

06:47.449 --> 06:49.492
She's gonna be right
when she comes out of there.

06:52.829 --> 06:55.372
- Cora. Cora.
- Aunt Bam.

06:55.457 --> 06:56.624
Baby, what are you doing here?

06:56.708 --> 06:59.418
Mr. Brown wasn't feeling well last night.

06:59.961 --> 07:01.504
Well, you know he has diabetes, right?

07:01.588 --> 07:02.838
- He does?
- Yep.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.466
- Lord, that's gonna kill him.
- Don't say that.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.635
- Lord, he's gonna die. He's gonna die.
- He's...

07:07.719 --> 07:08.928
He's not gonna die with that.

07:09.012 --> 07:11.263
- Well, go on back there and see him then.
- Well, all right.

07:11.348 --> 07:12.890
Well, wait a minute now, why are you...

07:12.974 --> 07:16.310
I'm all right, honey, I don't get sick.
I'm here with Shirley. Shirley's back there.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.395
- How is she?
- She's okay.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.147
She's okay. She's got strong faith.

07:20.357 --> 07:22.608
- That's what we need.
- She's got a strong back, too.

07:22.776 --> 07:25.736
That could have made a lot for her
back in the day...

07:25.821 --> 07:28.447
But, she could pull the hell out of a wagon.

07:28.532 --> 07:31.826
- What you...
- Yeah. I ain't even... We didn't need horses.

07:32.661 --> 07:34.745
Shirley was a horse all by herself.

07:34.830 --> 07:38.207
She works like a horse,
she treats people nice.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.333
Yeah.

07:39.417 --> 07:41.210
It's just not good to get sick
and you treat people nice.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.212
That just don't ever seem fair to me.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.797
- Well, I...
- But it's okay, I guess,

07:44.881 --> 07:46.882
you know,
the Lord just moves in mysterious ways.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.051
- Yes, he does.
- His wonders to perform.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.929
Yes, well, okay.
I'll talk to you later, all right?

07:52.013 --> 07:53.430
- I'm going to see him.
- Please do, 'cause you...

07:53.515 --> 07:56.517
- And I'll call you. Don't call me.
- All right.

07:56.852 --> 07:59.019
'Cause you talks too much is what you do.

07:59.187 --> 08:00.646
What you be saying, though.

08:01.398 --> 08:03.649
Hey, baby. What the doctor say?

08:04.192 --> 08:05.317
It's not good.

08:05.777 --> 08:07.528
Girl, you gonna be all right.
You gonna be all right.

08:07.612 --> 08:10.781
Not this time.
I need you to call all my children.

08:10.866 --> 08:13.701
Okay, well, when we get home,
baby, I'll turn it on for you.

08:13.785 --> 08:15.286
As soon as we get to the house,
All My Children...

08:15.370 --> 08:16.412
Bam.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.290
You know, Bam,
you need to stop smoking all that weed.

08:19.374 --> 08:22.209
Every time you smoke that weed
you act like you crazy.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.670
What are you talking about?
You said you wanted to see All My Children.

08:24.754 --> 08:26.172
I said I was gonna turn it on for you.

08:26.256 --> 08:28.632
I wanna see all my family.

08:28.717 --> 08:30.259
Well, okay, make up your mind, hon.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.635
Do you wanna see All My Children
or you wanna see All in the Family?

08:32.721 --> 08:33.804
Which one?

08:34.597 --> 08:35.681
- Bam.
- What?

08:35.765 --> 08:37.975
Come on,
let's go catch this bus before we're too late.

08:38.058 --> 08:40.895
Wait, Shirley, baby,
did the doctor ask for my number?

08:41.104 --> 08:42.730
Did he? Did he ask for my digits?

08:42.981 --> 08:44.023
...come to the hospital?

08:44.107 --> 08:46.525
You just gonna come up here
and bring me like I'm a kid to the hospital.

08:46.610 --> 08:49.653
You got diabetes and you wasn't feeling
well and I brought you to the hospital.

08:49.738 --> 08:51.197
Well, I feel well now. Can we go?

08:52.324 --> 08:54.325
- Good day.
- Good day, Doctor. How you doing?

08:54.409 --> 08:55.993
- Very well, thanks.
- Good, good.

08:56.077 --> 08:58.495
Now, Mr. Brown,
you have to take your insulin.

08:58.580 --> 08:59.622
I've been taking.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.916
- Now, are you eating right?
- Yes, sure, I'm eating right. Yes.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.667
No, he doesn't. He's lying.

09:03.752 --> 09:05.502
Cora, ain't nobody...
You don't call me no liar.

09:05.587 --> 09:07.213
I'm your daddy.
You come here, you're gonna sit there

09:07.297 --> 09:08.672
and look at my face and call me no liar.

09:08.757 --> 09:10.716
- You don't know what I eat.
- I know what he ate.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.427
He ate 10 pieces of bacon,
three eggs, a biscuit

09:13.511 --> 09:16.805
and a pork chop with jelly and orange juice.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.849
Just for your information
that's where you lie,

09:18.934 --> 09:22.603
'cause I don't even eat pork.
I ate ham. Thank you.

09:24.022 --> 09:27.358
See, the problem with a lot of people is
they think diabetes is just a little sugar.

09:27.442 --> 09:29.443
It isn't. Now you have to eat right...

09:29.569 --> 09:31.862
- He don't do that.
...you have to exercise.

09:31.947 --> 09:33.280
He don't do that.

09:34.199 --> 09:37.117
And let me tell you something, there are
people who have lost their eyesight,

09:37.202 --> 09:40.120
their limbs, and even died from this disease.

09:40.205 --> 09:42.623
Now you gotta get serious about this,
lose some weight,

09:42.791 --> 09:45.668
- start exercising, or things could get worse.
- Exercise.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.920
Exercising, losing weight...

09:48.672 --> 09:50.673
I am... Doctor, I hear what you...

09:50.757 --> 09:51.799
Are you listening to what he's saying?

09:51.883 --> 09:54.051
Cora, didn't I just say
I hear what he's saying?

09:54.135 --> 09:56.887
Now you're gonna make me whoop you.
Get you some business.

09:57.389 --> 09:58.472
You need to get you a husband,

09:58.556 --> 10:00.224
maybe that'll keep you
out of other people's business.

10:00.308 --> 10:02.726
- You married, Doctor?
- No, sir.

10:02.936 --> 10:03.936
Cora ain't married neither.

10:04.020 --> 10:06.063
Why don't you ask her to marry you
and y'all live happily ever after

10:06.147 --> 10:07.356
in a forest or something?

10:07.440 --> 10:09.441
So she can leave me alone,
stay out of my business.

10:09.526 --> 10:10.859
Stay out of my mental function.

10:11.319 --> 10:12.611
What?

10:12.821 --> 10:16.699
Now, Mr. Brown, I've also noticed
you've never had a colonoscopy.

10:16.908 --> 10:18.117
Oh, yes, that's where you're wrong.

10:18.201 --> 10:21.453
I drink colas all the time.
I like colas with ice and everything.

10:21.579 --> 10:24.081
And he shouldn't be drinking colas.
There's too much sugar, isn't there, Doctor?

10:24.457 --> 10:27.042
Cora, you're too much sugar.
Looking like a bag of cotton candy.

10:28.503 --> 10:30.212
Cora is the snack demon.

10:30.297 --> 10:33.007
That's right. I caught her one day
sneaking to get some chips.

10:33.174 --> 10:35.384
Under your bed, I found them chip bags.

10:35.552 --> 10:39.096
And she got soda water bags
and cups and everything under her bed.

10:39.180 --> 10:41.640
- You...
- How many Oreos would this be?

10:42.475 --> 10:44.143
- You...
- You know how many it is! Tell me.

10:44.227 --> 10:45.436
- You know how many...
- Five Oreos.

10:45.520 --> 10:47.354
You can tell me 'cause you tried to tell me
the other night.

10:47.439 --> 10:48.522
We're not in here about me...

10:48.606 --> 10:52.026
Mr. Brown, I do have to tell you that
you are well past 40 now.

10:52.110 --> 10:53.527
Way past!

10:53.611 --> 10:57.114
Well, I ain't that much past. You're trying to
make it seem like 40 is down there,

10:57.198 --> 11:00.868
and I'm way back... I'm close to 40.
Forty's over there and I'm right there.

11:00.952 --> 11:03.829
You make it seem like I'm old or something.

11:03.913 --> 11:05.706
The point I'm trying to make is that
you should be having

11:05.790 --> 11:09.418
regular colon and prostrate exams.
It could save your life.

11:09.669 --> 11:15.674
Okay. You go ahead and check my collasum
and my prostitute. All right?

11:15.759 --> 11:17.468
It's prostate, Mr. Brown.

11:17.552 --> 11:19.678
Cora, I know. It's the same thing.

11:19.763 --> 11:21.972
Just go ahead and just check me.

11:22.057 --> 11:26.101
Hold on. I had some of Cora's chips I found

11:26.394 --> 11:28.312
and I might have some on my prostitate.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.064
Go ahead and check.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.691
Not that end, Mr. Brown.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.109
The other end.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.320
You talking about my beginning
and the end?

11:36.404 --> 11:38.030
- Yes!
- The devil is a liar!

11:38.114 --> 11:39.907
You can't be back there like that.

11:40.408 --> 11:43.035
- Wait, Doctor. Wait!
- Get him, Doc.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.662
I'm new! Please!

11:51.669 --> 11:52.753
Hey, Madea.

11:53.088 --> 11:54.338
What the doctor say about Brown?

11:54.547 --> 11:57.633
He's better. He just has to watch
his diabetes, just like you.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.885
Oh, yeah, he got to watch that, honey,
he got to watch that for real.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.970
He's gotta stop eating all that foolishness
and start exercising.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.764
You right.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.725
You right.
I think I'm gonna have the number four.

12:06.810 --> 12:08.435
Welcome to Snax. May I take your order?

12:09.312 --> 12:10.854
Are you at one of those drive-throughs?

12:10.939 --> 12:13.273
Yes, I'm at a drive-through. Hell, I'm hungry.
I'm trying to get some breakfast.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.359
Didn't I just tell you,
you have to start eating healthier?

12:15.443 --> 12:17.486
Cora, hell, I don't wanna hear that.

12:17.570 --> 12:20.739
I know you're probably standing
right next to a vending machine right now.

12:21.199 --> 12:23.450
What you got, a honey bun?

12:25.412 --> 12:27.830
Byron!

12:28.581 --> 12:30.082
Cora, listen, I got to go now.

12:30.667 --> 12:33.794
Girl, I'm driving on the phone. You know
Oprah don't want me driving on the phone.

12:33.878 --> 12:35.462
Goodbye.

12:35.547 --> 12:36.922
I'm upset, or whatever the case may be.

12:37.006 --> 12:42.636
I would like to have a ham,
egg and cheese biscuit and orange juice.

12:43.054 --> 12:45.222
Call Day back...
No, you call him on your phone,

12:45.306 --> 12:47.808
I'm gonna keep callin' Byron, but
I'm gonna keep hanging up, answering,

12:47.892 --> 12:49.351
"Nah, nah, nah." Hold on.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.979
- Heller?
- Lady, I hear you. Hold on!

12:52.480 --> 12:54.273
- You better answer that phone or...
- Okay.

12:55.150 --> 12:58.944
All right. The service ain't
what it used to be either, I tell you.

12:59.821 --> 13:02.614
It's Sabrina. Byron...

13:06.494 --> 13:08.370
You need to go on Maury for him, girl.

13:08.455 --> 13:09.663
For real, dawg.

13:11.124 --> 13:14.084
It's hot as hell in this Cadillac
and I don't have no air conditioner.

13:14.169 --> 13:15.461
What do you wanna eat?

13:15.670 --> 13:21.008
I want a ham and egg
and a cheese biscuit, okay? Heller!

13:21.092 --> 13:22.134
We're out of ham.

13:22.218 --> 13:23.427
You out of ham?

13:23.803 --> 13:26.680
Okay. All right. Fine, fine.
Then give me an egg and cheese biscuit.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.182
We're out of egg.

13:28.975 --> 13:31.560
You're out of egg? You're just...

13:32.353 --> 13:34.438
Fine! Then just give me a damn biscuit.

13:35.106 --> 13:37.441
It's 10:31, ma'am,
and we just stopped serving breakfast.

13:39.152 --> 13:42.821
Hold the hell on. I've been sitting here
for 15 minutes waiting on your... No, honey.

13:42.906 --> 13:44.781
No, no, no. I don't care. I want breakfast.

13:44.866 --> 13:46.950
You want something else
like lunch or something?

13:47.035 --> 13:48.494
Ain't nobody say nothing about no lunch.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.621
I don't want no lunch. I want breakfast.

13:50.705 --> 13:52.456
- Breakfast ended at 10:30...
- Oh, hell no.

13:59.797 --> 14:01.256
Everybody's all screaming around me
or whatever.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.633
- I don't know what you talkin' about.
- Little girl.

14:02.717 --> 14:03.759
What?

14:03.843 --> 14:07.012
I'm about to get carbon peroxide poisoning
in this damn car,

14:07.096 --> 14:08.639
waiting on you to get me my damn food.

14:08.723 --> 14:10.182
This Cadillac is old as hell.

14:10.266 --> 14:11.600
Where's my food at, honey?

14:11.726 --> 14:15.479
We're out of egg, we're out of ham,
and we're out of cheese and biscuit.

14:15.563 --> 14:16.813
So can you get out of line, please?

14:16.898 --> 14:18.106
Where's your manager, honey?

14:18.775 --> 14:19.983
Look, I am the manager.

14:20.235 --> 14:22.945
Now move!

14:23.071 --> 14:24.112
Move!

14:25.073 --> 14:27.407
You hear these people, it's crazy! For real!

14:33.665 --> 14:34.790
She got crazy.

14:37.627 --> 14:38.794
What the...

14:43.925 --> 14:45.676
Hell, you ain't got no damn sense.

14:45.760 --> 14:48.428
I told you I want my damn food.

14:48.763 --> 14:49.888
Oh, my God!

14:51.808 --> 14:54.059
I'm taking everything you got.

14:54.143 --> 14:55.686
You act like you ain't got no sense...

14:55.770 --> 14:57.521
Lady, what is wrong with you?

14:59.774 --> 15:01.608
- Oh, my God!
- What the hell's wrong with you?

15:02.860 --> 15:04.778
You're gonna videotape me?
You're gonna videotape me?

15:04.946 --> 15:06.321
I'm taking it out.

15:07.490 --> 15:10.826
I'm trying to be patient,
I don't know what the hell's wrong with y'all.

15:10.910 --> 15:13.203
Old people, y'all act like
y'all ain't got no sense...

15:13.288 --> 15:15.080
- I'm takin' some food...
- Where you at?

15:15.164 --> 15:18.375
...and I'm feeding my fat-ass daughter and
everybody else and see how you like that.

15:18.459 --> 15:20.043
You ain't seen nothing.

15:20.128 --> 15:23.589
I can't wait for you. If you lookin' for me,
my name is Cora Simmons.

15:47.071 --> 15:48.572
...one, two.

15:50.158 --> 15:51.658
I called everybody.

15:51.826 --> 15:53.619
- Good!
- Yep.

15:55.496 --> 15:56.997
You scared, Shirley?

15:57.832 --> 16:00.500
Ain't no room for fear when you're this tired.

16:03.630 --> 16:04.713
Bam,

16:05.506 --> 16:08.133
I don't want nobody screaming
at my funeral.

16:08.217 --> 16:10.218
- Shirley. I don't wanna talk about...
- Come on now.

16:10.303 --> 16:13.764
Listen to me. I can't tell this to my children.

16:13.848 --> 16:18.769
I want Reverend Jackson
to give an uplifting sermon.

16:19.020 --> 16:21.855
And I don't want you to let my children
fight about anything.

16:22.023 --> 16:26.276
And I want Sister Laura
to sing that song I like,

16:26.778 --> 16:28.862
"Heaven's Waiting for Me."

16:29.030 --> 16:30.364
Will you do that for me?

16:31.032 --> 16:32.240
Yes, I will, baby,

16:32.325 --> 16:36.370
but Shirley,
you're probably gonna outlive us all.

16:37.205 --> 16:39.164
Only God knows.

16:39.582 --> 16:41.625
Well, just in case you do,

16:42.543 --> 16:45.462
- when I die, I don't want no flowers.
- No?

16:45.546 --> 16:49.591
No, I don't want no flowers.
I want y'all to plant marijuana stalks

16:49.676 --> 16:52.010
all around my grave.

16:52.553 --> 16:54.054
- I knew I'd make you smile.
- Go!

16:54.138 --> 16:58.308
Instead of pouring some for the homies,
like the young folks there,

16:58.393 --> 17:03.188
I want y'all to have a puff, puff, pass, repass.

17:03.272 --> 17:07.608
Just pass them all out. Just pass them.
I wanna say, "Puff, puff, pass, repass."

17:07.777 --> 17:09.778
Put that down!

17:09.862 --> 17:12.071
- I love to hear you laugh.
- God gonna get you.

17:12.240 --> 17:15.951
- No. I...
- Puff, puff, pass...

17:16.828 --> 17:20.122
- I want you to start it off.
- All that noise goin' on in here. Hey, Mama.

17:20.205 --> 17:23.709
- Hey. Hi, honey.
- Hi.

17:23.792 --> 17:26.086
Give me little Byron. Come here, little Byron.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.463
- Go to Aunt Bam.
- Byron.

17:29.507 --> 17:32.426
Take little Byron. Take that baby.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.720
Smell like a grown man did it in that diaper.

17:34.804 --> 17:36.972
- Change that baby's diaper.
- Please.

17:37.181 --> 17:38.682
- Get that off of me.
- Okay, Mama.

17:38.850 --> 17:40.767
Let's go upstairs
and change you then, huh?

17:40.852 --> 17:44.438
Get you fresh. Baby, can you hand me
a diaper out the bag?

17:44.856 --> 17:46.732
I am not the nanny. Here.

17:48.776 --> 17:50.652
- Well, thank you.
- You're welcome.

17:52.447 --> 17:53.905
All right, Mama. I'm gonna go change him.

17:56.617 --> 17:58.827
Don't you think
you need to be going with him somewhere?

17:59.495 --> 18:01.621
Why? That is not my baby.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.291
I don't like you.

18:04.709 --> 18:07.294
- Excuse me?
- I said I don't like you.

18:07.962 --> 18:09.546
- So?
- Bam, the baby is here.

18:10.298 --> 18:13.925
Well, then I tell you what,
let's do a nursery rhyme for the baby.

18:14.510 --> 18:18.680
Row, row, row your ho
Up and down the street

18:18.806 --> 18:23.852
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
She's just a piece of meat

18:24.103 --> 18:25.353
Whatever!

18:25.480 --> 18:27.481
That's what I don't like about her.
That's why I get high.

18:27.565 --> 18:28.899
That's why I have to stay high.

18:29.317 --> 18:30.984
Tell me again why we're here.

18:31.778 --> 18:34.529
Listen, my mother wanted
all of us to come over, okay?

18:35.114 --> 18:37.824
I have better things to do
than sit at your mama's house.

18:38.284 --> 18:41.620
I mean, I don't know what's worse,
the baby poop or the smell of moth balls,

18:41.704 --> 18:42.871
or that Bam thing.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.748
Listen, baby, will you...

18:44.832 --> 18:46.750
Will you please let me just find out
what's going on first?

18:46.834 --> 18:48.502
After that I will take you home.

18:49.086 --> 18:51.004
How are you gonna take me home?
You ain't got no car.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.673
Every time I come over here,
it's some drama.

18:54.342 --> 18:56.760
You remember your apartment
and your Benz?

18:57.345 --> 18:58.678
Don't you miss it?

18:59.180 --> 19:02.516
Yeah. Yeah.
Just like I miss going to jail, right?

19:03.267 --> 19:05.060
And wasn't I right there by your side?

19:05.645 --> 19:07.813
You? But you wasn't in there.

19:08.105 --> 19:12.025
All you gotta do is make one little drop
and get us enough money to get a place.

19:12.610 --> 19:14.611
Instead of spending the night
at my sister's house

19:14.695 --> 19:18.824
and me sneaking up here in your mama's
house in the middle of the night.

19:19.158 --> 19:22.744
Come on, Byron, don't you wanna be
alone with me in our own place?

19:23.454 --> 19:25.121
It's just one drop.

19:26.290 --> 19:29.376
Listen, stop talking about that kind of stuff
around my son.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.461
Boy, he don't know what I'm saying.

19:31.546 --> 19:33.505
- Renee.
- What?

19:33.589 --> 19:34.881
You are not gonna get caught.

19:35.216 --> 19:38.677
Roscoe said you were one of his best guys
when you were slinging.

19:38.761 --> 19:40.804
Come on, Byron.
See, when I first met you, you had heart.

19:40.972 --> 19:42.055
Look, and I got heart!

19:44.183 --> 19:46.560
And I also got a job, too.
And that's enough for us right now.

19:46.769 --> 19:47.894
I'm out of the game.

19:48.020 --> 19:52.315
Look, I love you, Byron, I really do,
but that little 10 an hour you're making

19:52.400 --> 19:54.734
is not taking care of me or you.

19:55.152 --> 19:58.738
I don't wanna talk about this no more.
Okay?

19:59.365 --> 20:01.783
Okay. Fine.

20:04.579 --> 20:06.872
I told you to go right and you go left.

20:06.956 --> 20:09.416
- Okay.
- I can't stand you sometimes, Harold.

20:09.500 --> 20:13.253
Had you did what I told you to do
we would have been here 15 minutes ago.

20:13.337 --> 20:15.672
- Yeah...
- I told you this boy has to pee.

20:15.756 --> 20:17.382
- Yeah, but he's all right.
- What up, people? What up, Bam?

20:17.466 --> 20:18.758
- I wanna go to the bathroom.
- Hey, baby.

20:18.843 --> 20:21.219
You know where the bathroom is, boy.
Come on.

20:21.304 --> 20:25.515
Wait a minute, that boy is 10 years old
and y'all still taking him to the bathroom?

20:25.600 --> 20:27.601
I told her to stop babying these kids.

20:28.477 --> 20:29.769
What did you say, Harold?

20:29.854 --> 20:32.314
He said he told you
to stop babying these children.

20:32.398 --> 20:33.523
I did not say...

20:33.608 --> 20:35.650
- Shut up, you did.
- I didn't say that...

20:35.735 --> 20:38.153
- Hey, Tammy.
- Why would you... You're a tattletale.

20:38.362 --> 20:40.280
- Calvin!
- Hey, Shirley, how are you?

20:40.364 --> 20:43.408
- Where is Kimberly?
- You know your daughter, she's working,

20:43.492 --> 20:45.076
- but she'll be here.
- Oh, well.

20:45.161 --> 20:46.786
- Harold.
- Shirley.

20:46.871 --> 20:50.665
It's so good to see my two fine son-in-laws!

20:50.750 --> 20:53.084
- Yes, ma'am.
- Wait a minute, I only see one fine one, hon.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.628
Thank you, thank you, thank you, Aunt Bam.

20:54.712 --> 20:56.546
Child, I don't smoke that much, shut up.

20:57.256 --> 21:00.383
Don't turn that... Don't... Leave that alone.

21:00.468 --> 21:01.635
Now...

21:03.346 --> 21:04.971
Thank you very much.

21:05.056 --> 21:06.348
You didn't hear me say don't touch?

21:06.432 --> 21:07.891
Harold, you better get your child.

21:07.975 --> 21:10.393
H.J., stop that now,
you see grown folks talking now.

21:11.354 --> 21:12.479
Punk-ass.

21:13.981 --> 21:16.066
See this? Look at this right here.
I tell you what...

21:16.150 --> 21:18.318
- Bam, don't kill him! Don't kill him!
- Sit down.

21:18.694 --> 21:19.736
Touch it again.

21:19.820 --> 21:21.571
Don't kill him, Aunt Bam!

21:21.656 --> 21:25.241
Look, Harold can let that child act like
he wants to if they want to.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.035
Oh, I got another one, honey.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.912
Touch it again. Touch it.

21:28.996 --> 21:31.915
Touch it, Shaka Zulu. Touch it.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.085
- Harold, you don't see this?
- He's just a kid.

21:35.169 --> 21:37.796
- You know these new kids, they do...
- Shut up!

21:38.756 --> 21:42.384
He's a kid that needs to know
who the parents are, Harold.

21:42.551 --> 21:44.135
What do you expect, Aunt Bam?

21:44.512 --> 21:47.430
They let these kids run around
like they have no home training at all.

21:47.515 --> 21:49.599
That's why I don't allow my son
around these children.

21:49.684 --> 21:50.767
Baby...

21:53.229 --> 21:55.772
- What did she just say?
- Tammy, calm down.

21:55.856 --> 21:57.816
She said she don't want her children
around your children

21:57.900 --> 21:59.109
'cause your children act like fools.

21:59.193 --> 22:01.611
They look like fools, they dress like fools.

22:01.779 --> 22:03.488
- Look at them, they're just foolish.
- Thank you.

22:03.572 --> 22:05.615
I know you're not talking about my children.

22:06.283 --> 22:08.535
My boys that I'm raising?

22:09.161 --> 22:11.079
She punked you. You look like a sucker.

22:11.205 --> 22:12.455
See?

22:12.540 --> 22:14.791
This is why I didn't even wanna
come over here to begin with.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.835
Girl, you barely spend time
with Mama anyway.

22:16.919 --> 22:18.336
Being here ain't gonna kill you.

22:18.421 --> 22:20.213
Come on, girls, now calm down.

22:20.297 --> 22:21.923
Why are y'all
blowing up my phone up anyway?

22:22.008 --> 22:24.300
Wait a minute,
your mama told me to call y'all over here.

22:25.136 --> 22:28.138
- For what?
- I just wanted to see you, that's all.

22:29.265 --> 22:31.391
Mama, you know I got things to do.

22:32.768 --> 22:35.437
Well, at least stay
and have dinner with me. Please?

22:35.980 --> 22:38.064
- Please?
- In the middle of the week?

22:39.316 --> 22:41.860
It's bad enough we do this on Sundays.

22:42.611 --> 22:43.903
Princess,

22:44.030 --> 22:46.823
when was the last Sunday
that you came over here not to eat with us?

22:47.074 --> 22:50.076
I'm sorry, I must not have been here.
What year was that?

22:50.911 --> 22:53.663
You don't remember either, do you?
That's it.

22:53.873 --> 22:56.374
Mama, I don't like you begging her.

22:56.459 --> 22:59.044
Come on in the kitchen
and help me get this food together,

22:59.128 --> 23:01.588
I need somebody to go into the garage
and get the ice.

23:01.672 --> 23:03.757
- Me.
- I'll do it.

23:05.718 --> 23:07.844
Hey. Hey, wait for me. Don't y'all leave me...

23:08.262 --> 23:10.430
What am I supposed to do with it?

23:11.098 --> 23:13.600
I don't know, hold it?

23:14.351 --> 23:15.852
Sit... Don't play with me.

23:16.270 --> 23:20.440
Sit down, baby, and hold the baby
over there. They'll be back, trick.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.234
- What?
- You heard what I said, broad.

23:23.319 --> 23:24.402
I don't stutter.

23:25.112 --> 23:26.279
Touch the TV. Touch it!

23:30.159 --> 23:33.119
I don't like none of you.
You make me sick, all y'all.

23:33.829 --> 23:36.331
- Man, I'm so glad to be out of the house.
- Got it, Calvin?

23:36.499 --> 23:38.833
- Ain't that right?
- I'll tell you what,

23:39.627 --> 23:42.962
this ice is warmer
than your sister Tammy any day.

23:43.047 --> 23:45.381
Hey, hey, hey. You better calm down.

23:45.549 --> 23:47.759
Look, man,
I know it's your sister and I'm sorry,

23:47.843 --> 23:50.845
but sometimes, man, she makes me so...

23:51.639 --> 23:53.973
You better be quiet.
You know she can hear you.

23:54.975 --> 23:58.853
Y'all be playing, but she can
really hear like that. I mean, like a dog.

24:00.606 --> 24:02.023
What is wrong with your sisters, Byron?

24:02.108 --> 24:04.192
Man, what is wrong with women period?

24:04.276 --> 24:05.985
Sabrina, for instance, right?

24:06.153 --> 24:09.072
Man, that girl know
I only make $1,000 a month.

24:09.156 --> 24:10.865
And I still send her 300.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.909
- Three hundred?
- Man, the girl still ain't satisfied.

24:12.993 --> 24:15.120
As soon as I give her the money
you know what she wants to tell me?

24:15.204 --> 24:17.705
- What she say?
- "Wait a minute! Hold up!

24:17.998 --> 24:20.125
"Hold up! That ain't enough!"

24:20.209 --> 24:23.795
Got the weave and all.
"That ain't enough! I need more!"

24:24.880 --> 24:27.382
- So you know what I do?
- What do you do?

24:27.466 --> 24:28.967
I give her more.

24:29.760 --> 24:32.345
But then, look, the next time I see her
she's in some new clothes.

24:32.596 --> 24:35.181
Why don't you just start buying
the baby stuff and give it to her yourself?

24:35.349 --> 24:38.268
I tried that. All she do
is take the clothes back and get the money.

24:38.519 --> 24:39.519
- What?
- Yeah.

24:39.603 --> 24:42.522
No, no, young buck.
You got to take the tags off the clothes.

24:42.606 --> 24:45.316
What, did you think I didn't do that?
I did that, too.

24:45.442 --> 24:49.070
Then she takes the clothes and tries to
sell them to everybody in the neighborhood.

24:50.197 --> 24:52.532
I am telling y'all, man, she's crazy.

24:54.410 --> 24:58.079
I just... I just want my son to know
that I'm out here doing the right thing.

24:59.206 --> 25:02.041
But she's telling everybody
something different, you know?

25:02.877 --> 25:04.627
Man, what am I supposed to do?

25:05.880 --> 25:07.797
You got to keep Peter in the gate,
you understand me?

25:08.007 --> 25:10.425
Wait, wait, wait. Hold up.
I know you ain't talking.

25:11.218 --> 25:13.261
Yeah, you ought to think about
that next time you and Tammy

25:13.345 --> 25:15.722
decide to have some more
of them little demon seeds y'all got.

25:16.056 --> 25:17.807
- Demon seeds?
- Yeah, you.

25:17.892 --> 25:19.142
My kids ain't bad like that.

25:19.226 --> 25:23.062
Look, man, your kids are out of control.
You got to do better.

25:23.522 --> 25:26.274
Well, she won't let me discipline them.
She won't!

25:26.358 --> 25:28.359
And after a while I just stopped.

25:29.278 --> 25:33.072
Look, I don't know what's wrong with her.
We argue all the time,

25:33.157 --> 25:34.908
every time I turn around,
I was trying to do something,

25:34.992 --> 25:36.117
she's just driving me crazy!

25:36.202 --> 25:37.911
I'm dealing with the same thing
with Kimberly.

25:37.995 --> 25:40.872
She's always mad.
I don't know what to do with her.

25:40.956 --> 25:43.833
And it seems like the longer
that we're married, the worse it gets.

25:43.918 --> 25:46.502
You know what, maybe her and Tammy are
going through menopause or something.

25:47.046 --> 25:49.505
No, it ain't no menopause. Tammy...
Tammy...

25:49.715 --> 25:51.841
Tammy was like that when we first met.
Yeah.

25:51.926 --> 25:53.843
As soon as we got together
she was yelling at me.

25:53.928 --> 25:55.094
Wow.

25:55.179 --> 25:56.930
- What?
- And you still married her.

25:57.389 --> 26:00.141
Yeah. But it's worse now.

26:00.559 --> 26:04.520
'Cause now she won't look at me,
I can't touch her, I can't even come near her,

26:04.605 --> 26:06.981
and we ain't had sex in over a year.

26:07.066 --> 26:08.608
Oh, Lord Jesus, please kill the visuals.

26:09.026 --> 26:10.610
I'm bound up.

26:11.278 --> 26:12.946
Why do it sound like both of y'all in prison?

26:13.364 --> 26:15.156
I'd get more love in prison.

26:15.866 --> 26:19.953
Coming home to a house that you're paying
for, and there's no peace, is prison.

26:21.038 --> 26:22.413
I don't know
how much longer I can take this.

26:22.623 --> 26:25.250
- So what are you saying, man?
- Something's got to give.

26:25.459 --> 26:27.168
- Well, do you love my sister?
- Yeah.

26:27.711 --> 26:30.380
- All right, man.
- Sometimes that's not enough, Byron.

26:32.383 --> 26:36.719
I hear you on that, but, dawg,
you ain't got but six years in.

26:36.804 --> 26:39.472
Next week it will be 17 years for us.

26:41.976 --> 26:44.519
- You know what, something's got to give.
- Yeah.

26:44.728 --> 26:46.771
- You know, we need to hang out more.
- We need to talk on the phone

26:46.855 --> 26:48.773
- and support group or something.
- We need to go to a strip club.

26:48.857 --> 26:50.441
Wait, wait, wait, now,
hold up, hold up, hold up.

26:50.609 --> 26:52.318
Before y'all both go jumping
into the deep end,

26:53.028 --> 26:55.113
I know my sisters, all right?

26:55.197 --> 26:57.323
All y'all got to do is just
do something nice for them.

26:58.492 --> 27:02.328
Calvin, why did you take Kim
to one of them fly spots, man?

27:02.413 --> 27:04.831
Nice restaurant, let her relax a little bit.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.168
And Harold, find my sister a nice
anniversary gift or something like that.

27:09.545 --> 27:12.505
Anniversary gift?
Like what? What you think, though?

27:12.965 --> 27:15.174
I don't know. Some flowers, something.

27:17.011 --> 27:19.178
Okay. Okay, I'm gonna try that.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.848
I can't believe
I'm taking advice from an 18-year-old.

27:22.516 --> 27:24.642
Hey, hey, I know something
about them ladies. You see how I do.

27:25.394 --> 27:26.769
I got two fighting over me right now.

27:27.521 --> 27:28.688
Yes, you do.

27:29.857 --> 27:31.065
Hey, y'all smell that?

27:32.860 --> 27:34.736
That's weed.

27:37.072 --> 27:39.532
Aunt Bam. What are you doing?

27:42.328 --> 27:43.453
Yes.

27:43.871 --> 27:47.415
What? I'm hunting wabbits.
What the hell y'all think I'm doing?

27:48.625 --> 27:50.168
- Byron?
- Yes, ma'am.

27:50.336 --> 27:52.587
I think your baby mama's about to kill
your girlfriend.

27:52.796 --> 27:54.589
What? Baby mama?

27:54.673 --> 27:56.257
Yeah. Sounds like she got her
in a choke hold.

27:56.342 --> 27:57.967
- All right, Byron, you better get...
- No...

27:58.052 --> 28:01.012
- No, no, no, no!
- Byron.

28:02.723 --> 28:06.809
Byron, how you gonna disrespect me by
having one of your tricks holding my baby?

28:06.894 --> 28:08.311
Listen, we ain't together, okay?

28:08.395 --> 28:09.937
You know what, where my money at, Byron?

28:10.397 --> 28:13.399
Who are you calling a trick, retard?

28:13.776 --> 28:16.778
Byron, you told her
about my IQ test scores?

28:16.862 --> 28:19.030
For real? That's how you feel it?

28:19.656 --> 28:21.991
- What are you talking about?
- You make me sick.

28:22.076 --> 28:23.659
You so ugly with your yellow self,

28:23.744 --> 28:25.161
and you, start with me.

28:25.537 --> 28:28.414
Go ahead, start with me. Jump, frog, jump.

28:29.792 --> 28:32.668
You know what, Shirley, I know
you wanted me to come to this dinner,

28:32.753 --> 28:36.381
but I really can't do this. I can't have
my baby around this trash, I got to go.

28:36.465 --> 28:38.633
I really wanted you to stay for dinner.

28:38.926 --> 28:39.967
Mama?

28:40.052 --> 28:43.679
No, Ms. Shirley, no. No, ma'am,
no ham, no turkey. Just let me go.

28:43.764 --> 28:46.432
I already had a rough day at work
with some crazy old woman

28:46.517 --> 28:48.684
that needs to be in jail, for real, though.

28:48.769 --> 28:52.271
Speaking ofjail,
I hear you're back on the streets, Byron.

28:52.731 --> 28:53.856
- What?
- Selling dope.

28:53.941 --> 28:55.274
You know what I'm talking about.

28:55.359 --> 28:56.859
I wish.

28:56.944 --> 28:59.404
Mama, she's lying.

29:00.447 --> 29:02.824
Well, then the whole block is lying,
Ms. Shirley.

29:02.950 --> 29:04.117
Don't listen to her, okay?

29:04.451 --> 29:06.702
Look, she just wants you to be mad at me,
that's all.

29:06.787 --> 29:08.287
I just wanna know if I can get a dime bag.

29:08.372 --> 29:10.998
Oh, God, I got to check on my biscuits,
see if my...

29:11.083 --> 29:13.459
Oh, my God, what I got a lie for, Byron?

29:13.544 --> 29:15.336
Stop. Stop. Stop.

29:17.089 --> 29:19.924
Girl... I swear to God!

29:20.259 --> 29:23.970
Keep playing with me.
I'll have 5-O on your ass in 2.5 seconds.

29:24.179 --> 29:25.471
I want my money.

29:25.556 --> 29:27.265
How are you gonna give
this chick all this money

29:27.349 --> 29:30.726
but you can't even give me
$300 for your son?

29:30.811 --> 29:32.478
You're a trifling ass father, Byron.

29:32.563 --> 29:34.272
- Stop. Stop it.
- You was a trifling ass father, Byron.

29:34.356 --> 29:36.274
Listen. Hey, hey, hey.

29:36.358 --> 29:38.734
Hey. Shut up! Be quiet!

29:38.819 --> 29:40.611
Listen.

29:40.696 --> 29:43.197
- Shut the hell up.
- Please, thank you.

29:43.991 --> 29:45.741
You know I give you money every month.

29:45.826 --> 29:49.495
Oh, my God, I'm so happy that I got
this little job at this little burger joint,

29:49.663 --> 29:52.415
because it looks like I'm gonna have to be
the man of this relationship, too.

29:52.499 --> 29:56.335
We? Us? We ain't in no relationship. At all.

29:56.670 --> 29:58.296
Never. Ever.

29:58.380 --> 29:59.755
Boy, you know you want all this,

29:59.840 --> 30:01.299
this almondy stuff.

30:01.508 --> 30:04.093
Listen, can I get that dime bag, though?

30:04.428 --> 30:06.053
- Aunt Bam...
- Oh, my God.

30:06.138 --> 30:07.930
I gotta get out of here. Let me go.

30:08.140 --> 30:09.891
Come on. Your father don't want you.
But it's all right.

30:09.975 --> 30:11.684
We're gonna be all right. Excuse me.

30:11.852 --> 30:14.854
- "Father," with a "V"?
- Yeah.

30:14.938 --> 30:18.441
- "Faver," mother...
- Watch your mouth.

30:18.525 --> 30:20.359
- Excuse me.
- Okay. Keep it walking.

30:28.035 --> 30:30.912
I did the best I could to raise you
and you're gonna do this again?

30:31.079 --> 30:33.164
Mama, the girl is lying.

30:34.541 --> 30:36.250
You are gonna go back to jail.

30:36.502 --> 30:38.252
What is wrong with you, boy?

30:38.337 --> 30:41.047
- Ever since your father died...
- Look, Mama, she's lying.

30:42.925 --> 30:46.302
Look, if you don't believe me,
then I might as well go out here and do it.

30:46.386 --> 30:47.720
That's if you believe her.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.223
Mama, I'm not selling no dope.

30:51.558 --> 30:52.725
Mama, look at me.

30:53.393 --> 30:54.560
I'm not doing nothing.

30:54.895 --> 30:56.062
I wouldn't keep no secrets from you.

30:58.941 --> 31:00.816
Just like you wouldn't
keep no secrets from me.

31:05.572 --> 31:06.906
I get it.

31:09.743 --> 31:11.911
You can believe it if you want to.

31:14.081 --> 31:15.414
Renee!

31:15.958 --> 31:17.166
We out.

31:18.418 --> 31:20.503
Shirley, look, look, look.
Look, look, look, look.

31:20.587 --> 31:21.754
Quick, look, look, look.

31:23.048 --> 31:26.259
Mother, we're leaving, too.
I have to pick up my son from daycare.

31:26.343 --> 31:28.302
Mama wants to have dinner with you.
I don't get...

31:28.387 --> 31:30.429
You have dinner with her.

31:30.514 --> 31:33.140
I'm sure there's enough for you
and your herd.

31:33.267 --> 31:34.725
Girl, I will stump a mud hole

31:34.810 --> 31:37.103
- in your skinny, bougie...
- A mud...

31:37.271 --> 31:39.480
- Honey...
- Don't touch me, Calvin.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.946
I'm sorry, Ms. Shirley. See ya.

31:47.864 --> 31:49.323
- Aunt Bam.
- All right.

31:49.408 --> 31:51.701
Jiggle, jiggle, pull 'em apart.

31:53.996 --> 31:55.705
You ain't had that happen in a long time,
have you?

31:55.789 --> 31:57.331
No, but... Tammy.

31:58.125 --> 31:59.333
Bye, Calvin.

31:59.418 --> 32:01.794
I feel sorry for you
that you have to go home with that.

32:02.045 --> 32:04.338
What's a mud hole? What is it?

32:04.631 --> 32:05.798
Aunt Bam, you're too high.

32:05.882 --> 32:07.758
I would love to see that, I tell you.

32:08.135 --> 32:09.885
Harold, H.J., Will, come on.

32:11.930 --> 32:13.472
Well, that went nice.

32:14.516 --> 32:17.143
When am I gonna tell them
with them behaving that way?

32:17.227 --> 32:19.895
Shirley, listen, I don't know,
we'll figure something out, baby, please.

32:19.980 --> 32:22.523
But I want 'em all together so I can tell 'em.

32:22.649 --> 32:25.693
You're gonna ruin my high, honey.
You're gonna ruin it. You're gonna ruin it.

32:25.777 --> 32:26.986
I know you wanna tell 'em.

32:27.070 --> 32:29.572
Hey, y'all, Mama wants y'all...
She's gonna tell y'all something.

32:29.656 --> 32:32.116
Bam, you need to stop all that smoking.

32:32.200 --> 32:33.200
You need to smoke something.

32:34.870 --> 32:36.704
We've been arguing...

32:39.875 --> 32:41.250
- Shut the hell up.
- All right.

32:42.294 --> 32:46.005
Now wait a second. All right? All right?
Okay. All of you be quiet.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.716
Because I can tell the truth right here.

32:48.842 --> 32:51.344
We've got the results right here.

32:54.473 --> 32:55.556
Okay.

32:57.351 --> 32:59.518
In the case of Baby DeShawn,

33:01.021 --> 33:02.521
neither of you are the father.

33:03.690 --> 33:07.485
Lord, I knowed it, I knowed it.
I knowed that wasn't the daddy.

33:07.736 --> 33:10.613
Mabel, get your big ass out the way.
You know it's fit for television.

33:10.697 --> 33:14.033
That is trifling as hell.
How the hell she had all of them men

33:14.117 --> 33:16.577
if she don't even know
who the baby daddy is?

33:16.662 --> 33:19.038
Yeah.
You know who that remind me of? You.

33:20.415 --> 33:23.125
You know you was a ho back in the day.
Yes, indeed.

33:23.210 --> 33:26.754
But you know, look here, that boy,
he didn't even know that wasn't his baby.

33:26.838 --> 33:28.506
Been paying child support 18 years.

33:28.590 --> 33:30.758
Giving, two, three, four hundred dollars.

33:30.967 --> 33:33.010
Four hundred dollars
he's giving that girl a month.

33:33.303 --> 33:35.763
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna start a company.

33:35.889 --> 33:39.975
For every baby daddy who has been through
some trouble with baby mamas.

33:40.394 --> 33:42.895
I'm gonna call it, "1-800-Choke-That-Ho."

33:43.230 --> 33:46.440
How about 1-800-Choke-That-Ho?

33:46.733 --> 33:48.275
That's a rap song, Mabel.

33:48.402 --> 33:50.277
1-800-Choke-That-Ho.

33:50.487 --> 33:52.029
Joe, shut up. Just shut up.

33:52.114 --> 33:53.280
Mabel!

33:53.365 --> 33:57.660
Mabel! Mabel! Mabel! Mabel!

33:57.744 --> 33:59.620
I'm right here, jackass!

33:59.705 --> 34:02.915
Mabel, I went to the doctor,
and they say I'm dying.

34:03.083 --> 34:04.625
Mr. Brown, you are not dying.

34:04.710 --> 34:06.669
You had a colonoscopy
and they found a growth

34:06.753 --> 34:08.504
and they wanted to
remove it and do a biopsy.

34:08.630 --> 34:11.424
See, they wanna do a bibopsy on me.
That means I'm dying.

34:11.717 --> 34:12.757
They found a growth?

34:12.884 --> 34:14.092
- Yes.
- Yes.

34:14.177 --> 34:16.137
You had to go to the doctor to find that out?

34:16.221 --> 34:18.264
Hell, I'm looking at a growth
coming out of your shoes.

34:21.226 --> 34:23.060
That's a good one, Mabel.
I see the growth, too.

34:23.145 --> 34:25.603
Y'all laughing, but I think I got the cancer.

34:25.688 --> 34:27.106
You are the cancer!

34:27.607 --> 34:29.984
Mabel, can you do something for me, baby?

34:30.152 --> 34:31.777
- Yes. Yes.
- Do one thing for me.

34:31.945 --> 34:33.696
Can you just hold me one more time?

34:35.699 --> 34:37.283
- Madea! Madea!
- I can't see.

34:37.367 --> 34:39.493
Don't get up on me, touching me like that.

34:39.578 --> 34:41.120
You didn't have to do that, Madea.

34:41.204 --> 34:43.998
Mabel, you got big old man hands.

34:44.291 --> 34:46.417
And you don't have a big old man nothing.

34:47.043 --> 34:49.170
That's a good one, baby.

34:49.463 --> 34:51.297
You on a roll, girl. You on a roll.

34:51.630 --> 34:53.090
What did the veterinarian say?

34:53.925 --> 34:56.719
That girl said "the vet." She say "the vet."

34:56.803 --> 35:01.056
You is funny. You are the next Lenny Bruce.
You funny. You funny.

35:01.141 --> 35:02.183
Madea, that is not funny.

35:02.267 --> 35:04.435
What did the veterinarian say?
I'm sorry. Okay.

35:04.519 --> 35:07.646
It's not funny.
Y'all laughing, but I think I see the light.

35:08.064 --> 35:09.398
I see the light, too.

35:09.483 --> 35:11.859
Hell, all them colors you got on,
you are the light.

35:12.152 --> 35:14.945
Taste the rainbow.
You look like a pack of Skittles.

35:15.822 --> 35:17.907
MC Lyte, Crayola light,

35:18.492 --> 35:20.910
Budweiser Light, jackass light.

35:22.996 --> 35:25.039
I know, I know it wasn't good, but I got it.

35:25.123 --> 35:27.833
Madea, Uncle Joe, don't do that.
That is not nice.

35:28.376 --> 35:30.211
Just say something nice to him for once.

35:31.254 --> 35:33.839
I will say something nice to him for once.

35:34.591 --> 35:35.800
Something nice to you for once.

35:35.884 --> 35:37.259
Madea!

35:37.344 --> 35:38.803
When I'm gone, they'll appreciate me.

35:39.054 --> 35:41.931
All right, don't even worry about it.
You gonna be all right. You gonna be...

35:42.015 --> 35:43.474
- I am?
- Yes, Brown.

35:43.558 --> 35:47.686
Lots of people done had
to have colonoscopies.

35:47.771 --> 35:48.979
You're supposed to get that done

35:49.064 --> 35:50.397
when you get to be a certain age, anyway.

35:50.482 --> 35:51.482
You're gonna be all right.

35:51.566 --> 35:52.817
It's good to get your rooter checked.

35:52.901 --> 35:55.486
That's all right, Brown. That's all right,
Brown. You're gonna be fine.

35:55.570 --> 35:57.488
All dogs go to heaven.

36:00.075 --> 36:02.701
So, I know they have room for silverbacks.

36:04.162 --> 36:05.538
That is so mean, Uncle Joe.

36:06.373 --> 36:07.540
Funny.

36:07.666 --> 36:09.917
- Madea.
- He is silverback, too.

36:10.001 --> 36:11.794
He's just...

36:14.422 --> 36:17.842
Hey, y'all. Joe! Madea, Mabel.

36:17.926 --> 36:19.385
Hey, Bam.

36:19.553 --> 36:20.719
Hey, Cora. Hey, Brown.

36:20.971 --> 36:22.263
Hey, Bam.

36:22.389 --> 36:25.182
Bam, did they tell you I'm dying?

36:25.559 --> 36:26.851
That's good to hear.

36:27.310 --> 36:29.186
- What?
- Aunt Bam, he said he's dying.

36:30.105 --> 36:31.730
Oh, sorry.

36:33.441 --> 36:34.692
Help me.

36:41.575 --> 36:42.950
What brings you by here, honey?

36:43.159 --> 36:44.535
Shirley and her kids.

36:44.911 --> 36:45.995
How's she doing?

36:46.788 --> 36:48.622
Not good. Not good at all.

36:48.999 --> 36:51.917
Help me. Help me.

36:54.254 --> 36:56.255
You need to help her with her kids.

36:56.339 --> 36:58.757
- No, child. No, no, no.
- They out of control.

36:59.092 --> 37:01.468
I don't know why folks
wanna run to the elders

37:01.553 --> 37:03.095
after their children get out of control,

37:03.179 --> 37:06.473
when the elders be telling them all along
y'all need to get these children straight.

37:06.558 --> 37:09.435
Now that they're grown and out of control,
they want some help from us.

37:09.519 --> 37:12.771
I'm sorry, honey. We have
two different styles of raising children.

37:12.856 --> 37:14.773
She like to pray, I like to punch.

37:14.858 --> 37:16.692
We can't do that.
She's my favorite niece and all,

37:16.776 --> 37:18.736
but no, child,
I'm not fittin' to get into that. No.

37:19.029 --> 37:20.279
Help me.

37:22.115 --> 37:24.617
Abort, abort. Evacuate. Abort, evacuate.

37:24.701 --> 37:26.368
- What?
- Mabel, she needs your help, honey.

37:26.453 --> 37:29.622
Can't nobody bring
a family together like you can.

37:29.873 --> 37:33.083
And can't nobody eat a steak like you can.

37:33.376 --> 37:37.546
And can't nobody do me like Jesus.
Help me. Help me.

37:37.881 --> 37:41.717
Help me. Help me, please.
Somebody. Somebody, anybody...

37:41.801 --> 37:43.636
- Joe, what's wrong with you?
- Somebody help me.

37:44.137 --> 37:45.638
What is wrong with you, fool?

37:45.805 --> 37:46.805
Y'all don't hear that?

37:47.223 --> 37:48.474
- Hear what?
- Hear what?

37:49.809 --> 37:52.269
That's the floor. It's talking. Listen.

37:52.979 --> 37:54.939
Help me.

37:55.482 --> 37:59.234
It's saying that 'cause it got all y'all
big asses standing on that floor.

38:02.989 --> 38:04.490
- That's them.
- Joe.

38:04.991 --> 38:07.326
It's the truth.
Them floor joints is screaming...

38:09.579 --> 38:12.289
- They're screaming like...
- Shut the hell up, Joe, shut up.

38:12.499 --> 38:13.874
Don't shake like that, Mabel.

38:13.959 --> 38:16.669
Hell, all that cellulite,
and look like you got hail damage

38:16.753 --> 38:18.921
all over your legs when you shake.
Don't do that.

38:19.172 --> 38:21.256
These stretch marks
is a road map to heaven.

38:21.341 --> 38:25.219
You follow this GPS, it's gonna take you
somewhere you ain't never been before.

38:26.638 --> 38:29.556
Your stretch marks about to make me...
I got to throw up.

38:31.309 --> 38:32.726
You about to throw up
that cancer in your back.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.353
Get it all out, get it all out, let him use you.

38:34.562 --> 38:37.648
Mabel, please. Please help Shirley.

38:38.692 --> 38:40.067
Does Shirley know you're over here?

38:40.694 --> 38:42.611
Well, she'll be fine with it.

38:43.029 --> 38:44.113
She'll be fine with it.

38:44.280 --> 38:47.032
Give me all their addresses and I will
go by there and try to help them.

38:47.367 --> 38:48.909
Thank you. Yes!

38:50.453 --> 38:52.037
- You ain't gonna hold me...
- Just shut the hell up!

38:52.122 --> 38:53.414
What the hell's wrong with you, Brown?

38:53.498 --> 38:55.916
Talking about somebody...
Don't nobody wanna hold you here.

38:56.001 --> 38:57.918
Your mama didn't even wanna hold you
when you was born.

38:58.003 --> 39:00.087
I don't know what the hell
you always got something.

39:00.171 --> 39:02.047
You working on my damn nerves.

39:02.882 --> 39:04.133
Heller?

39:04.968 --> 39:07.553
Hold on. Joe, your bookie on the phone.

39:08.221 --> 39:11.223
I'll be damned if I come up in there
on that floor.

39:11.307 --> 39:13.142
That floor getting ready to cave in.

39:13.226 --> 39:17.062
The termites are saying, "Evacuate, run.
Everybody, man your battle stations.

39:17.147 --> 39:19.106
"Get out, get out. It's..."

39:20.900 --> 39:22.067
Come get the phone.

39:22.277 --> 39:25.696
Whoever that is, they're gonna have
to call me back, 'cause I ain't stupid.

39:25.780 --> 39:28.115
If I walk up in there,
that floor is gonna just go.

39:28.241 --> 39:30.617
'Cause I'm the feather
that will break the camel's back,

39:30.702 --> 39:31.910
'cause y'all killing that camel.

39:33.079 --> 39:34.663
All them joints is about to snap.

39:34.748 --> 39:37.708
The termites getting ready to run
from out of here, they're saying,

39:37.792 --> 39:40.210
"Evacuate! Abort! Abort!"

39:41.463 --> 39:43.839
The termites screaming, "Abort, abort!

39:44.215 --> 39:46.592
"Because these fat asses are gonna fall
through the roof."

39:47.469 --> 39:48.969
- What?
- Shut up, fool. Shut up.

39:49.763 --> 39:50.929
Shut up.

39:54.517 --> 39:55.976
How's it looking, Doctor?

39:59.606 --> 40:00.647
I'm sorry.

40:01.775 --> 40:03.192
No need to be sorry.

40:03.943 --> 40:05.110
Is there anything I can do?

40:06.029 --> 40:08.072
How long do I have?

40:09.074 --> 40:11.158
Four, maybe six weeks.

40:11.242 --> 40:14.161
And if we continue with the chemo,
maybe longer.

40:15.538 --> 40:19.458
Well, thank God for the days I have had.

40:20.960 --> 40:23.879
You're the most amazing patient
I've ever had, Ms. Shirley.

40:23.963 --> 40:27.591
Always smiling.
Always seeing the bright side.

40:28.009 --> 40:31.011
Well, living for God is the bright side.

40:31.638 --> 40:35.015
And, Doctor,
God bless you for all your help.

40:36.434 --> 40:39.812
I brought you these brownies.
Bam loves these.

40:42.065 --> 40:43.065
Thank you.

40:43.149 --> 40:44.691
And don't be so sad.

40:45.151 --> 40:46.735
I'm going to be fine.

40:47.862 --> 40:49.822
Calvin, I asked you to watch him.

40:50.281 --> 40:53.242
C.J., why would you drop that
when I told you not to?

40:53.326 --> 40:55.035
Don't do that again, okay?

40:55.120 --> 40:58.122
No more. Play with this. Here.

40:58.206 --> 41:01.208
C.J., are you okay? Are you okay?
You gonna be all right.

41:01.292 --> 41:03.585
Don't baby him while I'm talking to him.
He needs to learn.

41:03.670 --> 41:06.130
To learn what? He's 18 months, Kimberly.

41:06.214 --> 41:09.591
- I hate it when you do that, Calvin, I hate it.
- He's a baby.

41:09.676 --> 41:11.593
And he's gonna end up
just like Tammy's kids.

41:11.678 --> 41:13.679
- No, he's not.
- Yes, he is.

41:15.014 --> 41:18.183
You show me no respect,
do you know that? None.

41:19.602 --> 41:22.229
Babe, listen, I do show you respect.

41:22.313 --> 41:25.941
But you're wrong
and you shouldn't be yelling at him like that.

41:26.025 --> 41:27.860
Like the way you yell at your family.

41:28.027 --> 41:29.403
I mean, what is up with that?

41:29.487 --> 41:31.321
What's going on with you and your sister?

41:31.406 --> 41:32.531
I don't wanna talk about her.

41:32.824 --> 41:35.701
No, no. Something goes on every time
you're around your family.

41:36.077 --> 41:37.119
Drop it.

41:37.453 --> 41:39.955
I'm getting really tired of this, Kimberly.
Really tired.

41:40.290 --> 41:41.874
Well, that makes two of us.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.792
I think we need to see a marriage counselor.

41:44.043 --> 41:45.711
I'm not going to any counselor.

41:46.087 --> 41:47.588
So you're not interested in trying to fix this.

41:47.839 --> 41:49.506
Fix what? Tell me, what's broken?

41:54.345 --> 41:58.098
Well, I guess if you don't know,
then we don't need to see one.

42:04.189 --> 42:06.148
Who left these dishes in the sink?

42:06.232 --> 42:07.191
H.J.

42:07.275 --> 42:09.067
No, I didn't. Daddy left them.

42:09.861 --> 42:12.237
Oh, you wait until he gets home.

42:12.739 --> 42:15.157
You're gonna get it for lying on Daddy.

42:15.241 --> 42:16.533
You better shut up.

42:16.701 --> 42:18.160
I'm not a maid, you know.

42:18.244 --> 42:19.578
You look like one.

42:21.456 --> 42:24.041
Come wash these plates, H.J.,
and I'm not playing.

42:24.125 --> 42:26.919
I don't feel like washing them plates.
Tammy, leave me alone.

42:27.170 --> 42:30.172
- Boy, I could hurt you sometimes.
- Blah, blah, blah.

42:30.298 --> 42:31.798
Daddy's right. You nag too much.

42:31.966 --> 42:33.425
- He said that?
- Yeah.

42:33.509 --> 42:36.511
He said you don't cook right,
it be burnt all the time.

42:43.144 --> 42:45.395
- Hey, man.
- What's up, punk-ass?

42:45.480 --> 42:47.814
Did you bring me something home?

42:48.608 --> 42:50.859
- Did you do your homework?
- No, fool.

42:51.569 --> 42:53.946
Then I didn't bring you nothing home.

42:54.656 --> 42:56.365
- Where's your mom?
- In her skin.

42:56.449 --> 42:58.075
When you jump out, she jump in.

42:59.118 --> 43:01.119
- Move! You shut it.
- Damn.

43:02.914 --> 43:05.457
Tammy, it's our anniversary, baby.

43:06.960 --> 43:08.293
Good God.

43:10.004 --> 43:11.546
Happy anniversary, baby.

43:12.006 --> 43:15.092
You think I want some flowers you just
picked up on the side of the road?

43:15.176 --> 43:18.512
Ain't no thought put into that, Harold.
"Happy anniversary."

43:18.596 --> 43:20.681
Why would I wanna spend
an anniversary with you?

43:20.765 --> 43:22.849
There's nothing happy about the years
we've been together.

43:23.685 --> 43:25.060
Tammy, I'm trying.

43:25.144 --> 43:26.687
Yeah, I'm trying, too.

43:26.771 --> 43:28.438
I'm trying to get the hell away from you.

43:29.816 --> 43:32.651
And why'd you leave those dishes
in the sink there before you left?

43:33.152 --> 43:34.653
What? I didn't leave no plates.

43:34.737 --> 43:37.364
And you told our sons that I nag too much?

43:38.157 --> 43:40.033
- Tammy.
- Shut up, I'm talking.

43:40.451 --> 43:42.327
- But, I...
- I don't know why in the hell

43:42.412 --> 43:46.123
after I go to work all day
I got to come home and clean up after you.

43:46.457 --> 43:48.417
Tammy, you need to have these boys
help you clean up around here.

43:48.501 --> 43:50.168
Didn't I tell you I was talking?

43:51.587 --> 43:53.714
Okay? What is wrong with you?

43:54.340 --> 43:55.549
Am I allowed to answer that?

43:56.175 --> 43:57.634
That is a question, Harold.

43:59.887 --> 44:02.681
Never mind. Just leave me the hell alone.

44:04.058 --> 44:05.517
Will you at least take the flowers?

44:10.356 --> 44:13.567
- Oh, my God, it just cut me.
- Let me see.

44:13.651 --> 44:17.446
See? See? See? See?
That's what it is. That's what it is.

44:18.239 --> 44:19.489
What did I do to you?

44:19.741 --> 44:21.950
Don't start all that whining.

44:22.201 --> 44:24.453
Look, I just want us
to spend some time together.

44:24.537 --> 44:26.204
No, I'm going to bed.

44:26.748 --> 44:28.707
Keep your stuff in your pants. Good night.

44:29.083 --> 44:31.251
I don't wanna hear your voice.

44:32.170 --> 44:33.503
Shut up.

44:35.882 --> 44:37.090
Tammy...

44:40.178 --> 44:42.054
Happy anniversary, Tammy.

44:42.889 --> 44:45.807
Boy, open the door.
People looking out their windows.

44:46.726 --> 44:47.726
"Be quiet."

44:47.810 --> 44:49.603
You always trying to tell me to be quiet.

44:49.687 --> 44:50.812
I swear,
you're getting on my nerves with that.

44:50.897 --> 44:53.106
What? Are you serious?

44:53.191 --> 44:54.232
You really have me sneaking

44:54.317 --> 44:55.776
- through your mother's house again.
- Stop! Stop! Stop!

44:55.860 --> 44:57.861
I don't like this. Let my hand go.

44:57.945 --> 44:59.196
- Girl...
- What?

44:59.280 --> 45:00.822
You better hush your mouth.

45:00.907 --> 45:02.824
Take me to a hotel with your cheap ass.

45:02.909 --> 45:04.493
- I ain't got no money for no hotel.
- Of course you don't.

45:04.577 --> 45:06.119
You don't have money for a hotel,
to buy me shoes

45:06.204 --> 45:07.287
- or anything else for that matter.
- Be quiet!

45:07.372 --> 45:08.789
- You're getting on my damn nerves.
- Stop it.

45:08.873 --> 45:10.290
Why you got to... Pain in the ass.

45:10.375 --> 45:11.375
Shut up.

45:12.710 --> 45:14.920
- It stinks in here.
- Be quiet.

45:15.588 --> 45:17.297
Look, do you love me?

45:17.382 --> 45:18.840
Yes, I guess.

45:19.092 --> 45:21.051
All right then. Stick with me.

45:21.219 --> 45:23.970
You work at a warehouse.
What am I supposed to do with that?

45:24.180 --> 45:26.139
I don't know. How about you get a job?

45:26.849 --> 45:30.310
If I got to get a J-A-B,
you ain't getting N-U-N.

45:30.561 --> 45:32.270
Yes, you heard me.

45:32.355 --> 45:33.480
See, when I first met you,

45:33.564 --> 45:35.023
I told you that I needed to be kept.

45:35.233 --> 45:36.441
You're not keeping me.

45:36.734 --> 45:39.986
- Look, Renee.
- What? It's just one drop. I don't get it.

45:40.321 --> 45:42.948
No. The answer's no.

45:43.699 --> 45:45.867
- Okay.
- Yeah.

45:48.162 --> 45:50.956
Look, how about you be quiet
before you wake my mama up.

45:51.040 --> 45:52.541
You're so worried about me
waking your mama up,

45:52.625 --> 45:54.876
look like the police are about to.

45:54.961 --> 45:55.961
What?

46:00.133 --> 46:01.133
Damn!

46:02.552 --> 46:03.927
Oh, this is so ghetto.

46:08.975 --> 46:10.767
- Byron Watkins?
- Yeah.

46:11.102 --> 46:13.228
Put your hands behind your back.
We have a warrant for your arrest.

46:13.312 --> 46:15.397
- For what?
- What is he getting arrested for?

46:15.481 --> 46:16.565
- What is going on?
- What did I do?

46:16.649 --> 46:18.608
- Come with us, sir.
- Mama, I didn't do nothing, okay?

46:18.693 --> 46:21.611
- Ma'am, please, step back inside the house.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

46:21.696 --> 46:23.155
Officers, wait a minute.

46:23.239 --> 46:26.491
- He don't even sell drugs no more.
- Oh, hush up about all them drugs.

46:26.701 --> 46:28.577
What are you doing here?

46:44.010 --> 46:46.344
Hi. I've been calling you.

46:47.847 --> 46:51.057
Mother, what are you doing here this late?
How did you get here?

46:51.142 --> 46:52.517
On the bus.

46:53.644 --> 46:54.853
The bus?

46:55.354 --> 46:57.147
Mama, there are no buses
in this neighborhood.

46:57.356 --> 47:01.067
Well, I rode it as close as I could get,
then I walked the rest of the way.

47:02.028 --> 47:03.069
What's going on?

47:03.571 --> 47:05.906
- Byron was arrested.
- Again?

47:07.283 --> 47:09.451
Yes, and I need bail money for him.

47:09.535 --> 47:11.870
No. Mama, I'm not giving you any money.

47:11.954 --> 47:15.457
If Byron wants to walk around here
selling dope, I can't stop him.

47:15.541 --> 47:17.292
He was not selling dope.

47:17.502 --> 47:18.627
Then what was he arrested for?

47:18.711 --> 47:20.504
I don't know, but it wasn't that.

47:20.922 --> 47:22.047
How do you know, Mama?

47:23.216 --> 47:26.384
I looked into his eyes. A mother knows.

47:28.387 --> 47:30.055
A mother knows.

47:31.390 --> 47:34.893
Mama, I'm sorry,
but I'm not giving you any money.

47:35.478 --> 47:38.104
Just use my house, then, as collateral.

47:39.023 --> 47:40.440
It's already paid for.

47:40.691 --> 47:42.692
Yes, it is, but I just paid it off again.

47:43.110 --> 47:44.903
Do you remember all the debt
from the second mortgage

47:44.987 --> 47:46.571
and getting him the lawyer the last time?

47:47.073 --> 47:49.491
- He is not lying.
- He was before.

47:49.700 --> 47:51.910
- Ms. Shirley.
- Go back to bed, Calvin.

47:51.994 --> 47:54.246
Ms. Shirley, come on inside.
What are you doing outside?

47:54.956 --> 47:56.998
- I was just...
- Money.

47:57.416 --> 48:00.293
Byron got arrested and she wants money.

48:00.878 --> 48:02.963
I'm sorry. How did you get here?

48:03.339 --> 48:05.340
On the bus. Can you help...

48:05.424 --> 48:07.842
Look, Mama,
I told you I'm not giving you any money.

48:07.927 --> 48:10.095
- Kimberly.
- Stay out of this, Calvin.

48:12.098 --> 48:14.849
Let me put some clothes on.
We'll go down there and bail him out.

48:14.934 --> 48:15.934
Oh, really, with what?

48:17.270 --> 48:20.772
Gosh, you are just going to disrespect me
and my wishes again?

48:20.940 --> 48:22.065
That's your mother, girl.

48:22.441 --> 48:24.651
What are you going to do,
let her walk home?

48:25.111 --> 48:29.614
Well, she did find a way to get here.
I'm sure she can find her way back.

48:32.702 --> 48:33.785
You are something else.

48:36.289 --> 48:38.456
I don't know why she treats me that way.

48:38.791 --> 48:39.874
I'm sorry, Ms. Shirley.

48:42.545 --> 48:45.880
All I've ever tried to do was love her,
you know.

48:46.173 --> 48:49.217
Oh, it's okay. Don't cry, don't cry. It's okay.

48:49.635 --> 48:51.469
I'm just tired, Calvin.

48:54.056 --> 48:55.807
I'm just so tired.

48:57.810 --> 48:59.769
- Cora, I don't wanna go.
- Mr. Brown...

48:59.854 --> 49:01.396
Cora, you can't make me go, no way.

49:01.480 --> 49:05.066
All right, Mr. Brown, listen, we're going
to make you as comfortable as we can.

49:05.151 --> 49:07.569
Cora, you don't have to let him
do this to me.

49:07.653 --> 49:08.820
You're gonna be all right, Mr. Brown.

49:08.904 --> 49:09.904
I ain't gonna be all right.

49:09.989 --> 49:11.615
You go in there and they tell you
it's gonna be all right,

49:11.699 --> 49:13.408
- you wake up dead.
- Oh, no...

49:13.492 --> 49:14.743
Y'all kill people in here.

49:14.827 --> 49:16.494
Have anybody ever died in here?

49:17.204 --> 49:20.457
- Exactly. Cora, don't do this to me, please!
- Calm down, Mr. Brown.

49:20.541 --> 49:23.376
- Cora, tell Madea... Tell Madea I love her.
- I will.

49:23.461 --> 49:27.047
- Okay, Cora, tell Madea I'm gonna miss her.
- All right, Mr. Brown.

49:27.131 --> 49:29.090
- Please, Cora, pray for your daddy.
- I will, Mr. Brown.

49:29.175 --> 49:30.884
- Pray for your daddy.
- I'm praying for you now.

49:30.968 --> 49:33.303
- Don't let him do... Pray for your daddy.
- I'm praying for you.

49:33.429 --> 49:35.472
Pray for your dad

49:35.556 --> 49:36.556
I'm praying.

49:36.641 --> 49:38.767
Pray for your daddy

49:38.851 --> 49:41.186
- Cora, pray. Sing it.
- I'm praying.

49:41.270 --> 49:42.854
Pray for your daddy

49:43.689 --> 49:46.107
Bam, this is what I don't understand.
When did you start going to church?

49:46.192 --> 49:47.609
Look, I had to go to church.

49:47.693 --> 49:49.653
Bam, back in the day
we used to share the dime.

49:49.737 --> 49:53.448
We used to steal, kill, rob and stab
and now you run to the church house.

49:53.699 --> 49:54.949
Yes, I had to.

49:55.034 --> 49:56.785
Child, I ran up in that church house...

49:56.869 --> 49:57.869
Stop that lying.

49:57.953 --> 50:00.372
What? I ain't even told you the whole
story yet.

50:00.456 --> 50:01.790
You done told three lies

50:01.874 --> 50:05.293
just that quick, talking about "I ran up."
You're lying.

50:05.378 --> 50:07.170
You ain't run up nowhere.

50:07.254 --> 50:09.547
Look, everybody need run up in here
from this house.

50:09.632 --> 50:12.759
These people, they're just a mess up in here.
It's just awful.

50:12.843 --> 50:14.719
I got about $200 I can let y'all borrow.

50:14.804 --> 50:16.763
About $200, I'll go down there
and put it on his book

50:16.847 --> 50:19.099
or give y'all for bail,
but you can't get it till the 1 st.

50:19.600 --> 50:20.642
Can't get it till the 1 st?

50:20.726 --> 50:21.726
Got to get it on the 1 st.

50:21.852 --> 50:23.937
Well, we need it today, but it's okay.
It's all right.

50:24.021 --> 50:25.730
We'll take what we can get, hon.

50:25.815 --> 50:28.942
But I was just hoping that Kimberly
would just give it all to her.

50:29.068 --> 50:30.735
That thing's still mean as hell, ain't she?

50:30.986 --> 50:33.363
Mean as a junkyard dog.

50:33.864 --> 50:37.075
And listen, Tammy's boys are out of control.
Way out of control.

50:37.410 --> 50:39.494
- Really?
- Just misbehaving.

50:39.578 --> 50:41.037
- Just awful.
- I need to meet them.

50:41.580 --> 50:42.914
Byron's baby mama.

50:43.708 --> 50:47.752
She's just ghetto. Real ghetto.
And then her voice just drives you crazy.

50:50.131 --> 50:52.465
I don't know why she be doing
all that whining and carrying on.

50:52.550 --> 50:54.050
She's just crazy.

50:54.260 --> 50:57.345
I told Shirley, I said, "Let me talk
to them children," long, long time ago.

50:57.430 --> 50:59.389
She saying,
"No, I'm just gonna pray for them."

50:59.473 --> 51:01.182
The Bible say, "Faith without work is dead."

51:01.267 --> 51:03.184
You got to do more than just pray
for them children, don't you?

51:03.269 --> 51:04.728
- You do.
- You got to knock the hell out of them.

51:04.812 --> 51:06.354
- That's what you got to do.
- The Christians...

51:06.439 --> 51:07.480
The Christians need to know that.

51:07.565 --> 51:09.649
That's right. From the top, from the top.

51:10.359 --> 51:12.694
- Ding, there's the Lord.
- Yes. Yes.

51:13.863 --> 51:16.448
- Hey, Shirley. What is you doing, girl?
- Hey, Madea.

51:16.532 --> 51:18.992
- Get on here and sit down.
- What are you doing here?

51:19.076 --> 51:21.745
- How you been?
- Oh, fair to middling.

51:22.079 --> 51:24.164
Fair to middling.

51:24.248 --> 51:25.790
Bam told you, didn't she?

51:26.125 --> 51:29.502
She got you $200 that she's gonna
bring by on the 1 st. Is it 1 st?

51:29.670 --> 51:30.712
On the 1 st. On the 1 st.

51:30.796 --> 51:32.464
- On the 1 st?
- 'Cause I won't have it till the 1 st.

51:32.673 --> 51:34.090
But what did Kimberly say?

51:37.344 --> 51:38.970
Well, did she give you some money for him?

51:39.138 --> 51:42.807
No. She won't even let me borrow
on my own house.

51:43.726 --> 51:44.809
Well, I called Harold and Tammy.

51:45.478 --> 51:47.854
- They ain't got money.
- You're right. They ain't got money.

51:47.938 --> 51:48.938
No, nothing.

51:49.064 --> 51:50.607
Don't you get all worked up
about this, Shirley.

51:50.733 --> 51:53.693
- Don't you do it. Don't you do it.
- Oh, Lord, my children.

51:53.778 --> 51:56.196
That's all right, honey. You done raised
them children the best you can.

51:56.280 --> 51:58.490
Let me tell you something,
parents shouldn't be putting themselves

51:58.574 --> 52:00.700
on no guilt trip
after you done raised the child.

52:00.951 --> 52:03.203
That's what they were supposed...
You're supposed to raise that child.

52:03.287 --> 52:05.413
You get them to a place where they grown
and get the hell out

52:05.498 --> 52:06.790
and take care of their own damn self.

52:06.874 --> 52:08.124
That's what the children need to do.

52:08.209 --> 52:09.584
You done did that.
That's your responsibility.

52:09.668 --> 52:10.668
You did the best you could.

52:10.753 --> 52:12.086
Don't get worked up about no damn child.

52:12.671 --> 52:14.172
Hell, no. You did the best you could.

52:14.256 --> 52:15.423
- Didn't you do the best you could?
- Yeah.

52:15.508 --> 52:16.591
Then that's all that matters.

52:16.675 --> 52:18.802
I know, I know. But I just feel, you know.

52:19.303 --> 52:21.262
I feel like you need to let that go.

52:21.347 --> 52:23.389
Well, anyway, we couldn't get him out.

52:24.308 --> 52:25.433
They wouldn't tell us anything.

52:25.518 --> 52:28.186
They wouldn't even tell us
what he was arrested for.

52:28.479 --> 52:29.813
That what the po-po do.
They don't tell you nothing.

52:29.897 --> 52:33.733
Calvin is going to go back down there
with one of his lawyer friends.

52:33.818 --> 52:37.445
- Oh, oh. Did you call Byron's job?
- Yeah. I called them bastards.

52:37.905 --> 52:39.614
- What did they say?
- They got rid of him.

52:39.698 --> 52:42.617
- They're bastards. They're bastards.
- I hate that. I hate it.

52:43.536 --> 52:45.787
Bam, you know, I need to tell him.

52:45.871 --> 52:47.664
I'm so tired. I'm running out of time.

52:47.790 --> 52:48.957
Why don't you just let me call them?

52:49.041 --> 52:50.792
No, no. I don't want you to call.

52:50.876 --> 52:52.001
I wanna tell them.

52:52.086 --> 52:55.547
I want them to all be together
and I wanna tell them at the same time.

52:55.631 --> 52:58.466
I wanna sit down at a nice dinner
and then I'm gonna tell them.

52:58.551 --> 53:00.802
You've been saying that you want
to tell them at the same time,

53:00.886 --> 53:01.886
you wanna have dinner...

53:01.971 --> 53:03.137
Bam, I understand that.

53:03.430 --> 53:05.431
You want all your children
so they can comfort each other, Bam,

53:05.516 --> 53:06.474
when she tells them the bad news.

53:06.559 --> 53:08.101
That's all right, honey. That's all right.

53:08.185 --> 53:10.395
But, Shirley, let me help you
get these children over here.

53:10.646 --> 53:12.272
- Oh, please.
- Can I help you?

53:13.232 --> 53:16.150
They will be here at dinner at 6:00.
Have dinner ready.

53:16.235 --> 53:17.735
- Today?
- Today. That's right.

53:17.862 --> 53:19.487
How are you going to get them over here?

53:19.613 --> 53:21.322
See, y'all Christians is something.

53:21.407 --> 53:22.615
Y'all gonna pull out that Bible,

53:22.700 --> 53:26.202
but y'all don't know which prescripture
to use for which situation.

53:26.287 --> 53:28.246
You've got to find the right prescripture.

53:28.330 --> 53:30.498
There's a prescripture that says,

53:30.583 --> 53:32.834
"Let the redeemed of the Lord say so."

53:32.918 --> 53:34.335
- Yeah.
- Have you been redeemed by the Lord?

53:34.920 --> 53:35.920
- Yes.
- That's right.

53:36.005 --> 53:37.589
So if you've been redeemed by the Lord

53:37.840 --> 53:40.550
and somebody does something to you
that you don't like, even your kids,

53:40.634 --> 53:42.760
you can beat the hell out of them
and just say, "So?"

53:42.845 --> 53:43.845
So that's what I'm gonna do.

53:43.929 --> 53:45.430
I'm gonna beat the hell out of them
and say, "So?"

53:45.514 --> 53:48.308
And I'm gonna bring them over here
'cause you've been redeemed. I am.

53:48.392 --> 53:49.684
You know what?

53:49.768 --> 53:51.519
- It makes sense, don't it? God is good.
- It makes sense.

53:51.604 --> 53:52.854
Hallelujer. Hallelujer.

53:52.938 --> 53:54.147
- Halleluiah.
- Hallelujer!

53:57.151 --> 53:59.277
- Thanks, man.
- That's what family's for.

53:59.612 --> 54:00.820
- You okay?
- Yeah, man.

54:00.905 --> 54:03.197
I just got to get to work, though, that's all.

54:03.282 --> 54:06.034
- Come on, I'll drop you off.
- Byron! Byron!

54:07.328 --> 54:09.078
Just keep walking.

54:10.247 --> 54:13.958
- So how was your night in jail, Byron?
- Just keep walking.

54:14.627 --> 54:17.211
I've been waiting for them to bail you out.
Hey, Calvin.

54:17.296 --> 54:18.504
Hey, Sabrina.

54:18.589 --> 54:21.591
You better get to work.
You gonna lose that little job.

54:22.426 --> 54:24.218
You know what? You damn right.

54:24.303 --> 54:27.513
'Cause that mean
you won't be getting nothing no more.

54:27.598 --> 54:29.307
I bet I will.

54:29.600 --> 54:31.476
- Byron, come on.
- No, no. No, hold on.

54:32.311 --> 54:34.896
Sabrina, come on.
What are you messing with me for, huh?

54:35.189 --> 54:36.272
I'm trying.

54:36.357 --> 54:39.525
Then what, you're gonna throw me in jail
over some back child support?

54:41.779 --> 54:43.196
Where that little trick Renee at?

54:43.280 --> 54:44.530
Come on, you gotta get to work.

54:44.657 --> 54:46.616
Work? He ain't really working.

54:46.700 --> 54:48.660
He's gonna lose that little job anyway.

54:48.744 --> 54:50.912
Then he's gonna be back on the streets,
selling dope,

54:50.996 --> 54:52.747
and I better have my money then.

54:52.831 --> 54:53.957
- Come on...
- Let's go.

54:54.208 --> 54:56.876
Bye. Byron...

54:58.629 --> 55:00.505
I can't take it no more, man.

55:00.589 --> 55:04.509
Look, I got to deal with Renee on one ear,
I got to deal with Sabrina on the other.

55:04.718 --> 55:07.303
Byron, listen, don't let these girls
get you crossed up.

55:08.639 --> 55:09.722
You got to think about your son.

55:10.516 --> 55:13.101
You're doing good, man. You hear me?

55:14.395 --> 55:16.354
- Just stay straight.
- I'm trying, man.

55:28.450 --> 55:30.326
Throw your hands up.

55:32.788 --> 55:34.163
Hey, Harold.

55:34.540 --> 55:37.375
Hey, Ms. Madea. All right,
what's wrong with your car now?

55:37.459 --> 55:38.459
Nothing.

55:39.628 --> 55:41.254
- For real?
- Nothing's wrong with it at all,

55:41.338 --> 55:43.715
except the other day I went out there
and put my foot on the gas

55:43.799 --> 55:45.633
and the trunk opened.
What the hell is that, Harold?

55:45.884 --> 55:47.135
You are trifling as hell.

55:47.219 --> 55:49.887
I'm so tired of bringing my damn car
up in here for you to fix.

55:49.972 --> 55:51.723
I am not bringing it to you no more.
Do you understand?

55:51.807 --> 55:52.807
Not ever again.

55:52.891 --> 55:54.726
Every time I go out there in the morning
I try to start my car,

55:54.810 --> 55:57.520
do you know what happens?
Do you know what happens, Harold?

55:57.896 --> 55:59.480
It don't start. I have to pray.

55:59.565 --> 56:01.774
You know God don't like me.
You know he don't like me.

56:01.859 --> 56:05.486
All the hell I did in my lifetime,
you know he don't like me at all, hell.

56:05.738 --> 56:06.988
- All right. Let me handle this.
- No, sit down.

56:07.072 --> 56:09.073
Do what you do best. Sit down.
Just stay right where...

56:09.158 --> 56:11.617
Just plant your ass right there in that chair.

56:11.702 --> 56:13.786
Every time I come here,
you're sitting in that chair.

56:13.871 --> 56:15.872
People waiting on their car,
you're sitting in that chair.

56:15.956 --> 56:17.957
You're supposed to be changing oil,
you're sitting in that chair.

56:18.042 --> 56:19.417
You're supposed to be changing
the windshield wiper blade,

56:19.501 --> 56:20.543
you're sitting in that chair.

56:20.627 --> 56:22.378
Supposed to wash a car,
you're sitting in that chair.

56:22.463 --> 56:24.130
Let me tell you something,
when you die, tell them people

56:24.214 --> 56:27.050
to bury you on your stomach
to give your ass a break.

56:30.679 --> 56:31.763
Where is your wife?

56:32.056 --> 56:33.097
In here, Madea.

56:34.600 --> 56:36.893
- Oh, hey, Tammy. How you doing?
- Hi, Madea.

56:36.977 --> 56:39.312
I don't know how you married
that bastard, Lord.

56:39.855 --> 56:42.190
I ain't seen your kids
since they were five years old.

56:42.274 --> 56:44.025
What you been feeding
that big pumpkin over there?

56:44.109 --> 56:45.276
Look like he been eating hay.

56:45.360 --> 56:47.528
And you look like
you've been eating at the zoo.

56:47.780 --> 56:48.863
H. J...

56:49.156 --> 56:51.115
Oh, it's like that. He's just going...

56:51.200 --> 56:55.286
- I would... I'm just...
- What brings you by, Madea?

56:55.496 --> 56:58.331
- Is your car acting up?
- My car is fine.

56:59.041 --> 57:00.249
Oh, okay.

57:00.334 --> 57:03.336
Your mother told me to come over
and be nice to all the children.

57:03.504 --> 57:06.422
She said she's having a dinter
tonight at 6:00,

57:06.507 --> 57:08.424
and she want all of y'all
to come over and eat.

57:08.634 --> 57:10.301
We were just over there. What's going on?

57:10.594 --> 57:12.678
Nothing. She wants to see all of y'all.

57:12.763 --> 57:15.389
Me and Harold can't loan her
no more money, Madea.

57:15.474 --> 57:16.557
I mean, we're struggling.

57:16.850 --> 57:18.893
Child, I know you're struggling.
I'm looking at the top of your head.

57:18.977 --> 57:21.312
I see struggle written all over
that new growth.

57:21.396 --> 57:24.357
It is like a miracle just spelling it out
across the top of your head.

57:24.650 --> 57:26.192
Your mama want all of y'all
to come over there.

57:26.276 --> 57:28.528
Now, that's all I'm supposed to say.
Y'all be there, bring the kids...

57:28.821 --> 57:30.822
- I ain't going.
- You ain't going?

57:31.949 --> 57:33.282
Yes, you are.

57:34.910 --> 57:36.994
I said, I ain't going, Tammy.

57:39.998 --> 57:42.458
Okay. You're gonna let them
talk to you like that, Tammy?

57:43.085 --> 57:44.585
Don't worry, Madea. He's just a kid.

57:44.670 --> 57:48.339
Just kids end up being just adults
who are in just damn jail.

57:48.423 --> 57:50.800
Don't let no child talk to you like that,
Tammy, that's...

57:50.884 --> 57:53.845
Yeah, okay. I have a customer.
Don't go anywhere, okay? I'll be right back.

57:53.929 --> 57:55.513
- Well, go on and deal with that then.
- Okay.

57:55.639 --> 57:56.722
I'm gonna talk to the boys.

57:59.351 --> 58:00.810
What are you looking at, old lady?

58:03.188 --> 58:04.230
Come on... Hey...

58:06.066 --> 58:07.358
Stop hitting me, old lady.

58:14.366 --> 58:16.951
I don't wanna have this conversation
with you again.

58:17.035 --> 58:18.369
Do you understand, son?

58:18.620 --> 58:20.371
I see you learn fast.

58:20.873 --> 58:22.331
Now look here.

58:22.708 --> 58:26.002
You young folks are so damn disrespectful.
You're not gonna disrespect me.

58:26.086 --> 58:28.254
I come from the school where you said,
"Yes, ma'am. No, ma'am."

58:28.338 --> 58:30.131
"Yes, sir. No, sir."
You showed some respect,

58:30.215 --> 58:31.966
or you got your teeth
knocked out of your mouth.

58:32.050 --> 58:33.759
Do you understand me?
I can't stand young folks

58:33.844 --> 58:34.969
sitting around at the bus stop,

58:35.053 --> 58:37.346
got old people sitting there,
they're cussing, pants hanging off.

58:37.431 --> 58:38.472
You're gonna show me some respect.

58:38.557 --> 58:40.766
I got silver hair,
but I also have silver bullets.

58:40.851 --> 58:41.976
Do you want one of them?

58:42.978 --> 58:45.271
Now, when a lady walk here
you say, "Heller." Heller?

58:45.355 --> 58:47.940
- Heller.
- Heller!

58:48.025 --> 58:49.108
Heller.

58:49.193 --> 58:51.235
You be disrespectful again,
I'm gonna beat your ass.

58:52.571 --> 58:56.032
I'm gonna beat your ass till you ain't gonna
have nothing but legs running up your back.

58:56.116 --> 58:58.201
Do you hear me?
You're just gonna have legs, no more ass.

58:58.285 --> 59:00.453
'Cause I'm gonna beat it.
Do you hear me, boy?

59:02.998 --> 59:05.499
- Thank yer. Thank yer.
- Thank yer.

59:05.584 --> 59:07.001
Good afternoot.

59:07.085 --> 59:09.003
- Good afternoot.
- You're welker.

59:09.087 --> 59:11.255
- You're welker.
- Yes, you sound very proper now.

59:11.340 --> 59:13.424
- I'm going home.
- Goodbye, ma'am.

59:14.218 --> 59:15.718
That's wonderful.

59:15.802 --> 59:17.803
Thought you was going to be slow,
like your daddy.

59:17.888 --> 59:19.013
- Bye, Madea.
- See you later.

59:19.097 --> 59:20.181
Bye-bye, Madea.

59:20.265 --> 59:21.599
Bye, Harold. You maggot.

59:21.683 --> 59:23.684
Why is you face red, H. J?

59:24.770 --> 59:26.479
You constipated?

59:29.775 --> 59:31.108
Where were you, Byron?

59:31.193 --> 59:34.028
- Look, I can explain, all right?
- I'm listening.

59:34.112 --> 59:35.321
Look, I got arrested.

59:36.448 --> 59:38.366
- Listen, listen. It's not what you think, okay?
- Okay.

59:38.450 --> 59:40.368
Just a little back child support. That was it.

59:40.452 --> 59:41.661
Look, it wasn't even my fault.

59:41.870 --> 59:44.747
Take some responsibility, son.
It is your fault, all right?

59:44.831 --> 59:46.499
Life ain't happening just to you.

59:46.625 --> 59:50.294
Your choices, they have consequences.
I'm sorry.

59:51.797 --> 59:54.048
Mr. Mills, look, I need this job. Please!

59:54.132 --> 59:55.633
You didn't act like you needed this job.

59:55.717 --> 59:58.094
You were supposed to be here at 6:00 a.m.

59:58.303 --> 59:59.762
Look, I'm sorry.

01:00:00.681 --> 01:00:04.767
Please! Please! Come on.
Don't do this to me now.

01:00:06.061 --> 01:00:08.813
Who's the only person that gave me a shot
when I got out?

01:00:08.981 --> 01:00:13.317
Your chances with me, they've run out.
I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to let you go.

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:15.027
You're fired.

01:00:16.989 --> 01:00:19.365
So what am I supposed to do now? Huh?

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:20.700
Take up track.

01:00:20.867 --> 01:00:23.160
As a matter of fact, practice now.
Run on up out of here.

01:00:26.123 --> 01:00:27.373
Damn, man!

01:00:27.874 --> 01:00:29.750
Look, I ain't say nothing about soccer.

01:00:30.085 --> 01:00:33.629
Look, you better be glad I'm two classes
away from being baptized.

01:00:34.339 --> 01:00:37.049
All y'all get back in there. Don't get behind.

01:00:39.886 --> 01:00:41.595
- Hey, boy.
- Hey, Madea.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:44.515
Lord, I didn't know where the hell you work.
I done came way over here.

01:00:44.599 --> 01:00:47.018
- How you doing?
- I had a long night, okay?

01:00:47.269 --> 01:00:49.478
Look, I just got fired. I just wanna go home.

01:00:49.855 --> 01:00:51.480
Yeah, well, we all had a rough night here.

01:00:51.565 --> 01:00:52.565
Your mama's having a rough night.

01:00:52.649 --> 01:00:55.484
She want all of y'all at her house at 6:00.
She having a dinner over there.

01:00:55.861 --> 01:00:57.737
- Mama don't wanna see me.
- Yeah, she do.

01:00:57.821 --> 01:00:59.989
Now, be there. I'm telling you,
we're gonna have a nice dinner

01:01:00.073 --> 01:01:01.991
and I wanna talk to all y'all,
she's gonna talk to you.

01:01:02.075 --> 01:01:03.200
So be there at 6:00.

01:01:03.285 --> 01:01:04.452
And if you ain't there,
let me tell you something.

01:01:04.536 --> 01:01:05.828
You're gonna wish that the sperm

01:01:05.912 --> 01:01:07.830
did a backstroke when it saw the egg
that created you.

01:01:07.914 --> 01:01:09.040
Do you understand?

01:01:09.541 --> 01:01:10.666
And pull your pants up.

01:01:10.751 --> 01:01:13.127
Why the hell you got
your pants on the ground?

01:01:13.211 --> 01:01:16.130
I don't know what the hell is wrong
with y'all young boys with these damn pants

01:01:16.214 --> 01:01:17.423
hanging down to your knees.

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:19.300
That don't look good. You look like a fool.

01:01:19.384 --> 01:01:20.468
That's probably why you got arrested.

01:01:20.552 --> 01:01:21.969
You can't run from the police like that.

01:01:22.054 --> 01:01:24.472
I want to meet the jackass
that started pulling his pants down

01:01:24.556 --> 01:01:25.973
and then everybody started following him.

01:01:26.058 --> 01:01:28.100
Why can't you lead
and let everybody follow you?

01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:30.144
Pull your damn pants up.
Look like somebody.

01:01:30.771 --> 01:01:32.605
It's called swag. Just...

01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:34.273
I got your swag.

01:01:34.566 --> 01:01:36.609
Somebody looking at your ass
when you walk down the street.

01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:37.985
That ain't no damn swag.

01:01:38.070 --> 01:01:40.196
Get the hell on out of here.
You better be there at 6:00.

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:41.364
And pull your pants up.

01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:45.201
Now this house is sitting
on three acres of land.

01:01:45.369 --> 01:01:48.871
So you have plenty of room
if you do plan on having little ones.

01:01:49.414 --> 01:01:52.416
And when you come out here,
I mean, it's beautiful.

01:01:52.501 --> 01:01:54.460
We have excellent school systems.

01:01:57.923 --> 01:02:00.216
On the outside,
we have the cobblestone driveway...

01:02:05.097 --> 01:02:07.765
And an infinity pool in the background
that leads into a waterfall.

01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:11.268
Also a nice little grilling area in the back
if you ever wanna entertain your guests.

01:02:11.353 --> 01:02:12.728
- It's a beautiful home.
- Man, it's so bougie.

01:02:12.813 --> 01:02:14.855
We have the wooden...

01:02:17.901 --> 01:02:19.944
- We have the marble pillars here.
- I know she didn't just act like

01:02:20.028 --> 01:02:22.238
- she didn't see me. Kimberly!
- With all the bordering that you can...

01:02:22.322 --> 01:02:25.449
I know you didn't just act like you didn't see
me when I looked through that window.

01:02:25.534 --> 01:02:27.701
- Kimberly.
- Madea.

01:02:27.786 --> 01:02:28.953
- Yes.
- Hello.

01:02:29.121 --> 01:02:30.287
You got clients.

01:02:30.372 --> 01:02:33.290
I'm showing a house. Could we speak later?

01:02:34.835 --> 01:02:37.920
Ner. I came over here
because I need to talk to you.

01:02:40.298 --> 01:02:43.092
Excuse me. This will only take a second.
Just give me a moment, please?

01:02:43.176 --> 01:02:44.635
- Okay.
- Thanks.

01:02:46.972 --> 01:02:50.391
Madea, this is highly inappropriate.
How did you know I was here?

01:02:50.642 --> 01:02:53.436
Because your husband told me
where the hell you were.

01:02:54.104 --> 01:02:55.521
I am going to kill him.

01:02:56.022 --> 01:02:57.606
Why haven't you returned
my telephone calls?

01:02:57.691 --> 01:02:59.442
Because I've been busy.

01:02:59.526 --> 01:03:03.320
You ain't been that busy that you can't
return my tetephone calls.

01:03:03.405 --> 01:03:04.905
Now, listen, your mama...

01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:06.824
No, this is not the time for that, okay?

01:03:06.908 --> 01:03:08.534
Girl, don't you interrupt me...

01:03:09.119 --> 01:03:11.620
Who the hell...
Look here. I talked to your mama.

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:13.456
Could you lower your voice?

01:03:15.167 --> 01:03:16.375
Okay. Excuse me.

01:03:17.586 --> 01:03:21.088
Your mama has asked me
to come over to this house

01:03:21.256 --> 01:03:24.592
to get all of y'all to come over there
to dinter, okay?

01:03:24.676 --> 01:03:28.679
6:00. Have your ass at the table
to give thanks to God for what he's done.

01:03:28.763 --> 01:03:29.805
Do you understand me?

01:03:29.890 --> 01:03:32.099
Don't make me have to come back
over here to find you.

01:03:32.184 --> 01:03:35.769
Because I will drag you out of here
by your two front teeth.

01:03:35.854 --> 01:03:38.772
That's all you will get for Christmas.
Do you understand me?

01:03:38.857 --> 01:03:42.318
Do you understand
what the hell I am saying to you?

01:03:42.402 --> 01:03:45.112
Do you understand the words
that are coming out of my mouth?

01:03:45.197 --> 01:03:47.281
- Yes, ma'am. I understand.
- Let me tell you something.

01:03:47.365 --> 01:03:50.201
If you are not there, every house...
No, don't look at them.

01:03:50.285 --> 01:03:51.619
Don't look at them.

01:03:51.703 --> 01:03:53.996
Let me tell you something,
every house you get ready to sell,

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:56.123
I will be in the front window like this.

01:03:56.541 --> 01:03:57.708
Do you hear what the hell I am telling you?

01:03:58.210 --> 01:03:59.668
Fine. I'll be there.

01:04:00.045 --> 01:04:02.129
- I will see you there.
- Okay, all right. Goodbye.

01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:03.714
So good to see all of you.

01:04:03.798 --> 01:04:07.092
And I hope you enjoy and buy the house.
It's a lovely home.

01:04:07.302 --> 01:04:09.512
Upstairs it looks like it has three bedrooms,

01:04:09.596 --> 01:04:12.973
two bathrooms
and everything else that people like.

01:04:13.058 --> 01:04:15.351
Okay. Don't touch me.
Don't put your hands on me.

01:04:15.435 --> 01:04:17.311
You better go handle your client.
Get the hell away from me.

01:04:17.395 --> 01:04:19.063
Don't put your damn hands on me.

01:04:20.398 --> 01:04:22.149
Got me coming over here
to this damn neighborhood.

01:04:22.234 --> 01:04:25.402
You know I don't have
a driver's license, the first.

01:04:26.071 --> 01:04:28.739
How the hell do I get out of
this bougie neighborhood?

01:04:33.411 --> 01:04:35.538
- Hello, Ms. Cora.
- Dr. Evans.

01:04:36.998 --> 01:04:38.832
- How is he?
- He's okay.

01:04:38.917 --> 01:04:40.709
But he's lost a lot of blood.

01:04:41.336 --> 01:04:43.337
Really? Is he gonna be okay?

01:04:43.421 --> 01:04:47.091
Oh, yes, yes.
But, would you mind giving some blood?

01:04:47.175 --> 01:04:48.425
It's always best from a relative.

01:04:48.885 --> 01:04:50.219
Sure, sure. I will.

01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:51.679
What's your blood type?

01:04:53.181 --> 01:04:54.348
I'm really not sure of that.

01:04:55.267 --> 01:04:56.725
- Well, come on. We'll find out.
- All right.

01:04:57.352 --> 01:04:59.603
Jiggling, jiggling, jiggling, and you know,
all these stretch marks.

01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:01.188
What, they look like lightning.

01:05:01.273 --> 01:05:02.523
Oh, look at that chicken.

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:07.611
You didn't tell me you was making chicken.
I love your chicken.

01:05:08.613 --> 01:05:10.781
Let's bow our heads.

01:05:12.033 --> 01:05:13.158
Oh, God.

01:05:13.243 --> 01:05:14.994
- Heavenly...
- Byron!

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:23.586
- What is that?
- That's the baby mama from hell.

01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:26.839
What are you doing here?

01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:29.133
Look, take this baby.
I got somewheres to go.

01:05:29.217 --> 01:05:30.884
Look, and I got things to do, too.

01:05:30.969 --> 01:05:34.305
Like what, Byron?
Come on. I need to get to the TV station.

01:05:34.598 --> 01:05:36.724
What are you talking about? TV...
What are you doing?

01:05:37.017 --> 01:05:39.935
Look, you need nots to worry about
what I'm doing, all right.

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:43.022
Hi, Ms. Shirley and everybody.
What's up? Hey, Calvin.

01:05:43.273 --> 01:05:44.273
Hey!

01:05:44.482 --> 01:05:45.858
Where that little trick at?

01:05:45.942 --> 01:05:49.236
Now, look here. This is a very private
family moment right now, okay?

01:05:49.321 --> 01:05:51.530
You got to come back some other time.
Take your child on out of here.

01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:54.491
- Don't I know you?
- Don't I know you?

01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:57.202
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

01:05:57.287 --> 01:06:00.331
You that lady that tried to come up
to my store and drive through my window.

01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:04.043
No, I didn't come up, I didn't try, I did,
'cause you ghetto as hell.

01:06:04.127 --> 01:06:06.462
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
Who is she talking to?

01:06:06.546 --> 01:06:08.130
Byron, she got the wrong one.

01:06:08.381 --> 01:06:10.883
We're having a very private
family moment right here now.

01:06:10.967 --> 01:06:13.719
You need to take that little baby
and y'all come on back some other time.

01:06:13.887 --> 01:06:16.055
- Now, go on now. Go on.
- Okay, okay.

01:06:16.598 --> 01:06:19.183
- Just give me my son, please. All right.
- Yeah.

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:22.102
- Would you get out of here, please?
- Glad to.

01:06:22.562 --> 01:06:26.649
But all I know is you better have my money.

01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:28.525
Man, she punk, and you look like...

01:06:30.612 --> 01:06:32.905
- Grown folks business. Shut the hell up.
- Will you please get out of here?

01:06:33.031 --> 01:06:34.365
Glad to.

01:06:34.574 --> 01:06:37.117
You know what I know,
if you knew better, you'd do better.

01:06:37.202 --> 01:06:39.745
You better have my money. Bye, y'all.

01:06:40.163 --> 01:06:41.664
Have a nice day.

01:06:41.790 --> 01:06:43.123
- Okay.
- You better lock the door

01:06:43.208 --> 01:06:45.084
- before she steals everything in the kitchen.
- Oh, Jesus.

01:06:45.168 --> 01:06:46.418
How the hell did you hook up with...

01:06:46.503 --> 01:06:48.462
See, young boy, that's what happens
when you hook up with...

01:06:48.546 --> 01:06:50.798
Oh, look who finally decided to show up.

01:06:50.882 --> 01:06:52.883
I can tell you this,
I thought I was gonna have to go out there

01:06:52.967 --> 01:06:55.135
and hunt you down like a rabid dog.

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:57.304
- Well, I made it.
- Yes, you did.

01:06:57.389 --> 01:06:58.889
She's so burgie.

01:07:02.310 --> 01:07:05.312
Did you tell Madea where I was?

01:07:05.397 --> 01:07:06.814
She was trying to find you.

01:07:08.733 --> 01:07:10.734
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

01:07:11.903 --> 01:07:13.696
That's all right.
We'll deal with this when we get home.

01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:15.864
- No. No, no...
- All right, let's pray.

01:07:15.949 --> 01:07:17.616
Let's deal with this right now.

01:07:17.701 --> 01:07:19.284
- I have an announcement to make.
- Calvin!

01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:20.452
- No!
- Keep your voice...

01:07:20.537 --> 01:07:23.038
Family, I am sick of Kimberly's bull.

01:07:25.917 --> 01:07:27.543
Do you think this is funny, Calvin?

01:07:27.919 --> 01:07:29.712
- Trouble in paradise.
- Tammy.

01:07:29.796 --> 01:07:30.879
What?

01:07:31.172 --> 01:07:35.175
You need to get some help,
and if you don't, I'm leaving.

01:07:36.177 --> 01:07:37.511
And I'm taking my son with me.

01:07:37.679 --> 01:07:40.097
You are not taking
my child anywhere, Calvin.

01:07:40.598 --> 01:07:43.350
You think I'm gonna let you
put all this venom in my child?

01:07:43.601 --> 01:07:46.645
You are not taking him...

01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:49.189
Don't these look good, Shirley?
They sure look good. Y'all wanna eat some?

01:07:49.274 --> 01:07:52.568
Yes, it does, yes, it does. I just wanna eat it.

01:07:52.694 --> 01:07:54.695
I can't do this.

01:07:54.779 --> 01:07:57.740
I can't do this. I'm sorry, I can't sit here

01:07:58.158 --> 01:08:01.452
like we're one big happy family
when you know we can't stand each other.

01:08:01.578 --> 01:08:03.370
- Kimberly...
- No, Mama.

01:08:03.455 --> 01:08:05.539
If you want us to sit here, you eat it.

01:08:05.623 --> 01:08:07.124
Kimberly, don't talk to your mother like that.

01:08:07.208 --> 01:08:08.709
Calvin, you better shut the hell up.

01:08:09.627 --> 01:08:12.337
I'll talk to my mom
how I wanna talk to my mother.

01:08:12.756 --> 01:08:14.882
I'm not gonna tell you again
to show me some damn respect.

01:08:14.966 --> 01:08:17.176
- What is wrong with you?
- You're what's wrong with me.

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:20.888
Everybody sitting here, like, playing nice.

01:08:20.971 --> 01:08:22.848
This is wrong. This is ridiculous.

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:27.644
Kimberly, I just wanted to have a nice
family dinner, everybody together.

01:08:27.854 --> 01:08:28.937
- Why?
- That's all.

01:08:29.022 --> 01:08:30.814
Girl, you better act like you got some sense.

01:08:31.983 --> 01:08:35.486
Shut up, Tammy. Nobody's talking to you.

01:08:35.862 --> 01:08:37.404
But I'm talking to you.

01:08:38.113 --> 01:08:43.076
You are always in my business.
It is so obvious you're jealous.

01:08:43.161 --> 01:08:44.286
Jealous of what?

01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:45.828
- Kim, stop...
- Shut up, Calvin.

01:08:45.913 --> 01:08:47.872
- Tammy, you...
- Shut up, Harold.

01:08:48.541 --> 01:08:50.209
What I got to be jealous of?

01:08:50.417 --> 01:08:52.002
Tammy, stop it.

01:08:52.127 --> 01:08:54.004
No, no. No, no, Shirley,
you need to let this happen.

01:08:54.087 --> 01:08:55.296
You need to let this happen and figure out

01:08:55.381 --> 01:08:57.006
what the hell is going on
with these children.

01:08:57.091 --> 01:08:58.926
Let it happen. Let it get all out in the open.

01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:01.511
Go on and say what you need to say.
Say what you need to say, Tam.

01:09:01.888 --> 01:09:04.389
- I wanna hear this.
- Of me.

01:09:05.183 --> 01:09:07.017
That's right. I said it. Me.

01:09:07.477 --> 01:09:09.937
My family, my husband...

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:12.606
Oh, girl, please.
I don't want anything you got.

01:09:13.358 --> 01:09:17.194
But you get rid of what you don't want,
don't you?

01:09:20.113 --> 01:09:21.113
Like us.

01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:23.533
- Whatever.
- We're your family.

01:09:23.743 --> 01:09:26.328
All Mama wanted us to do
was sit down and have dinner,

01:09:26.412 --> 01:09:27.912
but you just can't do that.

01:09:28.790 --> 01:09:30.374
Why, Kimberly?

01:09:30.582 --> 01:09:32.042
Are we too ghetto for you?

01:09:32.377 --> 01:09:33.961
You don't eat greens and cornbread
no more?

01:09:34.045 --> 01:09:35.879
- Tammy...
- No, Mama.

01:09:36.756 --> 01:09:37.881
I need to say this.

01:09:39.425 --> 01:09:40.716
I'm not jealous of you.

01:09:41.261 --> 01:09:43.554
I'm not the one who got pregnant at 13

01:09:43.971 --> 01:09:46.180
and had Mama to raise my child.

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:50.519
- Tammy!
- Say something now.

01:09:59.237 --> 01:10:01.572
Kimberly, what is she talking about?

01:10:04.617 --> 01:10:06.535
You are too ghetto for me.

01:10:07.078 --> 01:10:08.620
And you make me sick.

01:10:08.955 --> 01:10:13.417
Let's go.

01:10:15.545 --> 01:10:17.212
Now, Calvin.

01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:20.591
I need to talk to... Kimberly!

01:10:21.092 --> 01:10:22.134
I'm sorry, Mama.

01:10:23.928 --> 01:10:25.804
This had to happen, Shirley.
Don't worry about it.

01:10:25.889 --> 01:10:28.932
- It had to happen, Shirley. Let's pray.
- Please.

01:10:29.517 --> 01:10:31.351
- Come on, honey.
- Kimberly had a baby...

01:10:31.436 --> 01:10:34.605
Call on Jesus

01:10:36.107 --> 01:10:38.150
Aunt Bam, you used to watch the baby?

01:10:38.359 --> 01:10:42.237
Baby, you...
Yeah, I'm still watching the baby.

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:46.158
- You need a joint, baby. Really.
- No, I'm all right.

01:10:47.452 --> 01:10:48.785
Mom! Mom!

01:10:49.954 --> 01:10:51.496
Tell the pastor I say...

01:10:51.581 --> 01:10:53.582
Come on in the room

01:10:53.666 --> 01:10:56.251
Mom, you used to watch that baby?

01:10:58.421 --> 01:10:59.463
Yes.

01:10:59.547 --> 01:11:02.549
Jesus in my doctor

01:11:02.634 --> 01:11:03.675
And he

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:07.179
Writes out all of my scripture

01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:08.722
I mean, we're here.

01:11:11.184 --> 01:11:12.434
Where he at?

01:11:12.644 --> 01:11:16.104
I mean, we're all here as a family, right?
You know...

01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:21.109
You should look in the mirror.

01:11:31.287 --> 01:11:33.163
So what are y'all trying to say?

01:11:33.831 --> 01:11:35.415
Kimberly is my mother?

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.376
Yes.

01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:40.921
Talk about don't tell lies.

01:11:41.547 --> 01:11:42.631
Keeping secrets.

01:11:44.342 --> 01:11:45.717
But you kept one from me.

01:11:46.719 --> 01:11:48.220
All right.

01:11:49.472 --> 01:11:50.472
I'm out.

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.849
- Byron!
- I don't wanna hear it, Aunt Bam.

01:11:52.934 --> 01:11:54.393
- Wait a minute.
- Byron!

01:11:54.477 --> 01:11:57.521
Excuse me, everybody. Madea, carry on.

01:11:58.564 --> 01:11:59.940
Byron, let me talk to you, Son.

01:12:00.024 --> 01:12:02.109
Not right now. I don't wanna hear it, Mama.

01:12:03.945 --> 01:12:06.196
That wasn't the way to do that.

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:07.489
Shut up, Harold.

01:12:07.573 --> 01:12:08.615
Stop talking to this man like that.

01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:10.117
You're gonna stop
talking to this man like that.

01:12:10.201 --> 01:12:12.786
That's why these children don't have
no respect for the either one of y'all.

01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:16.373
Y'all sit there talking to each other
like y'all ain't got no sense.

01:12:16.541 --> 01:12:18.709
Get up and go upstairs.
Let me talk to your mommy and daddy.

01:12:18.793 --> 01:12:19.960
- Go on.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:12:20.044 --> 01:12:21.503
Very good.

01:12:26.676 --> 01:12:28.343
Now what was I saying?

01:12:29.095 --> 01:12:32.055
Harold, the only reason this woman is
talking to you like that is 'cause you let her.

01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:36.810
Don't no woman want no weak, whiny,
wimp running behind her like a wet dog.

01:12:36.894 --> 01:12:39.479
Put your foot down.
Stand up and be a man in your house.

01:12:39.564 --> 01:12:41.106
That's why your damn children
run around here

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:42.357
act like they ain't go no sense,

01:12:42.442 --> 01:12:44.234
talking back,
'cause you won't put your foot down.

01:12:44.318 --> 01:12:46.445
The children are watching
the two of y'all disrespect each other,

01:12:46.529 --> 01:12:48.030
so they're disrespecting you, too.

01:12:48.197 --> 01:12:49.281
Set an example.

01:12:49.365 --> 01:12:51.658
You used to love this man.
You used to love him to death.

01:12:51.743 --> 01:12:54.244
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
He ain't playing football.

01:12:54.412 --> 01:12:56.246
Y'all were gonna be together forever.
Remember that?

01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:57.831
Running up in here talking about
you getting married

01:12:57.915 --> 01:12:59.041
and how much you love him.

01:12:59.125 --> 01:13:01.168
Now you done hit that patch in life
you don't know what to do.

01:13:01.252 --> 01:13:02.878
Honey, everybody go through that patch.

01:13:03.087 --> 01:13:05.005
It's rough. I call it the traffic jam of life.

01:13:05.089 --> 01:13:09.009
It happens between the age of 40 and 50.
That is a rough decade for anybody.

01:13:09.093 --> 01:13:10.177
Do you hear me?

01:13:10.261 --> 01:13:12.846
Now, I'll tell you why. 'Cause during
that 10 years a few things happen.

01:13:12.930 --> 01:13:15.140
One, you go through menopause.

01:13:15.224 --> 01:13:17.225
Secondly,
your husband having a midlife crisis.

01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:20.103
If you got children, they start acting
like they ain't got no sense at all.

01:13:20.188 --> 01:13:22.481
At the same time your parents
are getting sick and dying,

01:13:22.565 --> 01:13:23.774
his parents are sick and dying.

01:13:23.858 --> 01:13:25.817
You try to take care of them,
take care of your household,

01:13:25.902 --> 01:13:28.236
that's enough to stress any marriage
apart, honey.

01:13:28.362 --> 01:13:30.530
That's enough to stress it out
and make y'all break up.

01:13:30.615 --> 01:13:32.199
That's why you're so angry, honey.

01:13:32.283 --> 01:13:33.992
You've got to take some time and deal...

01:13:34.077 --> 01:13:35.994
But he just makes me so mad, Madea.

01:13:36.079 --> 01:13:39.581
Get on up.
Go in the kitchen and have a conversation.

01:13:40.166 --> 01:13:42.876
That wasn't the way to tell that boy
that that's his mama.

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:46.004
That wasn't the way to tell him that at all.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

01:13:46.464 --> 01:13:47.714
Tammy.

01:13:47.799 --> 01:13:50.217
Be a man. Be a man.

01:13:50.635 --> 01:13:52.010
She's right.

01:13:53.721 --> 01:13:55.263
You got to stop being mean to me, Tammy.

01:13:55.348 --> 01:13:58.975
Harold, you got to stop acting like we don't
have any problems, because we do.

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:00.352
And if we don't clear this up, we are...

01:14:00.436 --> 01:14:02.604
You got to stop telling me what I got to do.

01:14:02.897 --> 01:14:05.565
You're going to stop being mean to me.

01:14:06.359 --> 01:14:07.818
You got it?

01:14:08.736 --> 01:14:09.986
You got it, Tammy, huh?

01:14:10.571 --> 01:14:11.738
Yeah.

01:14:12.949 --> 01:14:14.157
I'm sorry.

01:14:14.242 --> 01:14:16.326
That's right you're sorry. And...

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:19.204
Sit down. Sit down.

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:22.999
Now, sit your ass down. You heard me.

01:14:23.376 --> 01:14:25.460
You heard us...
I mean, you heard me. Sit down.

01:14:27.088 --> 01:14:28.547
S-l-T.

01:14:32.677 --> 01:14:35.679
Yeah. That's right.
It's gonna be a new day around here.

01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:38.140
H.J., Will, get in here...

01:14:38.307 --> 01:14:39.850
I'm glad I'm here. I got all this straight.

01:14:39.934 --> 01:14:41.309
Madea, I'm so glad you're here.

01:14:41.394 --> 01:14:42.769
You got all this straight.

01:14:42.854 --> 01:14:44.187
- Yes, indeed.
- This is wonderful.

01:14:46.941 --> 01:14:48.441
Where are you going?

01:14:49.402 --> 01:14:50.819
I love you.

01:14:50.903 --> 01:14:54.698
But the way you treat me and C.J.
And your family, I can't take it anymore.

01:14:55.074 --> 01:14:56.950
I can't believe you've been hiding
all these secrets from me.

01:14:57.034 --> 01:14:59.870
You think I need you? I don't need you.

01:14:59.954 --> 01:15:02.414
I was fine before you, and I'll be fine after.

01:15:02.623 --> 01:15:04.374
- Go ahead.
- You need help.

01:15:04.625 --> 01:15:05.667
I feel sorry for you.

01:15:06.127 --> 01:15:07.419
Go to hell.

01:15:09.839 --> 01:15:11.798
You're not taking my son.

01:15:12.884 --> 01:15:15.552
- You're not taking him.
- You watch me.

01:15:16.053 --> 01:15:17.387
Calvin...

01:15:17.471 --> 01:15:18.805
Get back here, Calvin. Don't leave me.

01:15:18.890 --> 01:15:22.392
What do you care?
You already got one you left at the doorstep.

01:15:23.936 --> 01:15:26.062
Don't take my baby, Calvin.

01:15:26.397 --> 01:15:28.857
That's my baby. Don't take him from me.

01:15:28.941 --> 01:15:31.067
Don't. Please.

01:15:32.195 --> 01:15:36.281
So Kimberly is your mother. Are you okay?

01:15:36.699 --> 01:15:38.200
Look, baby, I'm fine.

01:15:38.910 --> 01:15:40.535
That is crazy.

01:15:41.245 --> 01:15:43.121
Look, I don't wanna talk about that.

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:47.542
- You wanna go to my sister's house?
- No. No. I don't wanna be around all of them.

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:50.086
Well, then where are we going, Byron?

01:15:50.338 --> 01:15:54.424
Listen, babe, I'm gonna go holla at Roscoe,
a'ight? I'll make this last little drop.

01:15:55.134 --> 01:15:56.635
I gotta do what I gotta do.

01:15:56.719 --> 01:15:58.345
I'm so proud of you.

01:15:58.429 --> 01:16:02.474
- Hey, yo, my man. Just let me get a 40. And...
- Hey, how you doing?

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:05.644
On the next Maury, deadbeat dads.

01:16:05.895 --> 01:16:08.188
You out there selling drugs,
selling on the corner,

01:16:08.272 --> 01:16:09.981
working the block, pumping the strip,

01:16:10.066 --> 01:16:11.983
and you can't even give me no money
for your baby?

01:16:12.068 --> 01:16:15.570
But it's all right,
'cause we gonna be all right, Byron...

01:16:19.283 --> 01:16:21.534
I know I sound like a siren...

01:16:21.744 --> 01:16:23.787
But you won't take care of this baby...

01:16:24.205 --> 01:16:26.873
- Oh, hell no!
- And there ain't gonna be no maybe...

01:16:27.208 --> 01:16:28.375
Byron...

01:16:28.542 --> 01:16:30.126
Damn! Come on. Come on.

01:16:30.294 --> 01:16:34.297
We're talking about your son
and whether his father is in his life.

01:16:34.382 --> 01:16:36.299
That Byron baby mama
on The Maury Povich Show,

01:16:36.384 --> 01:16:38.093
talkin' about that boy. Lord have mercy.

01:16:38.177 --> 01:16:40.679
I don't even understand why that girl
would go on that television show

01:16:40.763 --> 01:16:42.138
and do that to that boy.

01:16:42.473 --> 01:16:44.891
Poor Byron. Lord have mercy.
I got to talk to him.

01:16:45.101 --> 01:16:48.353
I need to give him my number.
"1-800-Choke-That-Ho."

01:16:49.021 --> 01:16:50.981
Does he ever say, "It's not my child"?

01:16:51.065 --> 01:16:53.441
- Just ghetto at its best.
- I don't even like this show. Turn it...

01:16:53.943 --> 01:16:55.360
Turn it...

01:16:55.444 --> 01:16:57.279
Turn it up. Turn it up.

01:16:57.363 --> 01:16:58.780
- Yeah, she's nuts.
- Would you call him a deadbeat dad?

01:16:58.864 --> 01:17:00.532
- She's crazy. And he crazy to be with her.
- I think I would.

01:17:00.616 --> 01:17:02.242
- Cora.
- I'm coming.

01:17:02.326 --> 01:17:04.286
Hey, Brown, how's your ass?

01:17:04.495 --> 01:17:07.080
- It fine.
- Funky.

01:17:07.665 --> 01:17:11.167
What y'all doing sitting here...
What's the matter?

01:17:12.003 --> 01:17:14.462
Y'all look mad. What the doctor say?
Some bad news, Brown?

01:17:14.547 --> 01:17:17.090
- He's fine.
- Ask her, Cora.

01:17:17.591 --> 01:17:18.675
- You ask.
- Ask her.

01:17:18.759 --> 01:17:20.802
Madea, who's my daddy?

01:17:24.682 --> 01:17:27.225
I knew that was coming.
I knew that was coming.

01:17:30.855 --> 01:17:31.980
What are you talking about?

01:17:32.064 --> 01:17:34.649
All of the money I gave you for child support
on this child

01:17:34.859 --> 01:17:36.192
and you don't even know who her daddy is?

01:17:36.277 --> 01:17:38.737
Oh, bastard. You gave me $18 in 18 years.

01:17:38.821 --> 01:17:40.113
Shut the hell up. There wasn't no montey.

01:17:40.323 --> 01:17:42.282
What y'all talking about?
What you talking about?

01:17:42.366 --> 01:17:44.659
Madea, we had blood work
done at the hospital today,

01:17:44.785 --> 01:17:48.204
and Dr. Evans said there's no way possible
Mr. Brown could be my daddy.

01:17:48.289 --> 01:17:50.040
So I ask you, who is her daddy?

01:17:50.207 --> 01:17:53.418
Ya'll need to go on Maury, too. Call Maury.

01:17:53.961 --> 01:17:55.086
The doctor say that?

01:17:55.338 --> 01:17:56.546
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:17:56.881 --> 01:17:58.214
Who's my daddy, Madea?

01:17:59.717 --> 01:18:03.053
If Charlie Brown ain't your dad,
then I don't know who it is.

01:18:03.637 --> 01:18:05.472
Madea, how could you not know
who my daddy is?

01:18:05.556 --> 01:18:08.600
I hate to tell you this, honey,
but your mama was a ho.

01:18:08.934 --> 01:18:12.896
I was a ho.

01:18:13.356 --> 01:18:15.899
I put the "H" and the "O" in ho.

01:18:16.192 --> 01:18:18.234
- Who's my daddy, Madea?
- Okay, all right. I'm gonna tell you.

01:18:18.361 --> 01:18:19.736
Joe, shut up. Don't you say nothing.

01:18:20.029 --> 01:18:21.988
Who is it? He can tell me.
Who is it, Uncle Joe?

01:18:22.239 --> 01:18:26.826
Now this was before Hilary and after Monica.

01:18:28.913 --> 01:18:30.121
- What?
- What?

01:18:30.373 --> 01:18:31.831
Bill Clinton is my daddy?

01:18:32.917 --> 01:18:34.542
Bill Clinton was not your daddy.

01:18:34.627 --> 01:18:37.879
Okay. No, no.
It was before he started that show

01:18:37.963 --> 01:18:40.256
with Sybil and J. Anthony on the radio.

01:18:40.508 --> 01:18:42.926
I believe that might have been him.

01:18:43.886 --> 01:18:45.720
Tom Joyner is your daddy.

01:18:45.805 --> 01:18:47.597
Cora, I knew it. I knew it.

01:18:48.057 --> 01:18:50.975
- Oh, oh, oh. Ho! Ho! Ho!
- Uncle Joe.

01:18:52.478 --> 01:18:53.728
Tom Joyner ain't you dad, hon.

01:18:53.813 --> 01:18:55.688
Look, y'all stop asking me
all these questions, honey.

01:18:55.773 --> 01:18:57.190
That's your daddy right there.
I'm telling you.

01:18:57.274 --> 01:19:00.026
They made a mistake at the hospillar.
That is your daddy.

01:19:00.569 --> 01:19:01.903
I'm gonna find out.

01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:04.906
Dana'll tell you anything you wanna know.
Call Dana.

01:19:05.074 --> 01:19:07.784
- Dana? Who is Dana?
- Yeah, who is Dana?

01:19:07.868 --> 01:19:09.786
They both dumb as hell.
You don't know what Dana is?

01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:12.664
They've been using Dana
to find people out for years

01:19:12.748 --> 01:19:14.249
who the daddy or who the mama, Dana.

01:19:14.333 --> 01:19:15.750
And when you kill somebody, the crime,

01:19:15.835 --> 01:19:17.836
they use Dana to get
all the evidence on you.

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:20.046
Dumbass. You need to watch
some television sometime.

01:19:20.131 --> 01:19:22.757
Learn something.
Jackass don't know what Dana is. Hell.

01:19:23.467 --> 01:19:28.346
D-N-A. D-N-A. That's Dana.
Lord, you're so dumb.

01:19:29.265 --> 01:19:30.974
- Nobody called no Dana.
- No Dana.

01:19:31.142 --> 01:19:32.267
You know what here? That's your daddy.

01:19:32.351 --> 01:19:33.601
I don't even want to be bothered
with this no more.

01:19:33.686 --> 01:19:36.729
I done told you the truth. You don't like
what the hell I got to say, that's the truth.

01:19:36.814 --> 01:19:38.231
I'm sorry.
I know you don't want him to be your daddy,

01:19:38.315 --> 01:19:39.899
I didn't want him to be your daddy either.

01:19:39.984 --> 01:19:43.236
That was the worst 36 seconds of my life.
Right there sitting next to you.

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:44.904
- I'm out of here.
- You told me a minute.

01:19:44.989 --> 01:19:46.322
Girl, he messing with you.

01:19:49.201 --> 01:19:50.326
Maury.

01:19:50.411 --> 01:19:52.412
The DNA does not lie.

01:19:52.496 --> 01:19:55.957
If you want to find out who the father
of your child is call this number.

01:22:22.062 --> 01:22:25.315
- Mama!
- Yes, baby. I'm your mama.

01:22:25.608 --> 01:22:27.317
Mama, why are you in here?

01:22:28.235 --> 01:22:30.653
I've been sick a long time.

01:22:32.197 --> 01:22:33.865
Mama, why didn't you tell us?

01:22:33.949 --> 01:22:36.159
I tried to tell all y'all.

01:22:42.124 --> 01:22:44.417
Tammy, quit all that crying.

01:22:45.794 --> 01:22:47.211
Now, where Kimberly?

01:22:48.088 --> 01:22:52.008
We've all been trying to call her.
She won't pick up her phone.

01:22:53.135 --> 01:22:55.053
Mama, what's wrong?

01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:58.598
I wanted to tell all of y'all together.

01:23:01.185 --> 01:23:03.186
I guess that's too late.

01:23:04.355 --> 01:23:06.731
I got cancer...

01:23:08.567 --> 01:23:11.986
I let it go a long, long while.

01:23:13.322 --> 01:23:16.324
I prayed the whole way over here.

01:23:17.368 --> 01:23:20.662
I told God if you just feel a little bit better,

01:23:22.373 --> 01:23:23.956
I'll do right.

01:23:24.708 --> 01:23:26.751
I don't care who my mother is, all right?

01:23:27.878 --> 01:23:28.878
I don't.

01:23:30.547 --> 01:23:32.173
Because you're my mother.

01:23:33.717 --> 01:23:36.219
I'm gonna do right. But you gotta get better.

01:23:38.055 --> 01:23:39.597
You gotta get better.

01:23:39.890 --> 01:23:44.644
You're gonna have to get right on your own.

01:23:45.562 --> 01:23:48.064
- I'm dying, baby.
- No.

01:23:48.649 --> 01:23:50.358
- I'm so tired.
- No.

01:23:52.403 --> 01:23:56.948
Y'all got to get right with Jesus
so I can see you again.

01:23:57.408 --> 01:23:59.659
Mama, let's just do
what you taught us to do.

01:24:00.828 --> 01:24:02.578
We'll pray that God heals you.

01:24:03.038 --> 01:24:04.997
I prayed he'd heal me,

01:24:05.416 --> 01:24:08.251
but whether it's on this side or in heaven,
it's all right.

01:24:10.170 --> 01:24:11.921
Don't talk like that.

01:24:12.464 --> 01:24:13.798
Tammy,

01:24:13.882 --> 01:24:16.467
now you look at me. I ain't scared.

01:24:17.386 --> 01:24:19.345
You don't feel bad for me.

01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:23.474
You feel bad for somebody
that don't know Jesus. Okay?

01:24:24.518 --> 01:24:29.814
I'm just going home.

01:24:30.274 --> 01:24:31.524
Jesus.

01:24:34.945 --> 01:24:36.154
Where's Kimberly?

01:24:37.614 --> 01:24:39.741
She's not returning my calls.

01:24:40.617 --> 01:24:42.368
Tell her I waited on her.

01:24:46.331 --> 01:24:48.249
Tell her I love her.

01:24:50.711 --> 01:24:52.211
I love all of you.

01:24:56.425 --> 01:24:57.633
You got...

01:24:59.136 --> 01:25:01.179
You got to be strong.

01:25:01.889 --> 01:25:05.433
And all y'all got to come together.

01:25:08.061 --> 01:25:10.813
You gonna come together.

01:25:16.111 --> 01:25:18.321
- Mama.
- Mama. Mama.

01:25:20.824 --> 01:25:21.824
Shirley.

01:25:22.117 --> 01:25:24.494
I'll see you tomorrow morning, John.
Thank you.

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:27.079
No, I had to visit my mother at the hospital.

01:25:27.456 --> 01:25:30.792
I'm sure she's okay. Thank you so much.
I'll call you back. All right.

01:25:31.585 --> 01:25:32.668
Where were you?

01:25:33.086 --> 01:25:36.214
I had things to do. This is my family, Calvin.

01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:37.423
This is not your business.

01:25:37.549 --> 01:25:38.716
I called you for hours.

01:25:38.842 --> 01:25:40.426
Yeah, I know. I got your message.

01:25:40.761 --> 01:25:43.721
What makes you think I would
return you or Tammy's calls?

01:25:43.806 --> 01:25:46.891
- Where is my mother?
- She's in 208. Listen...

01:25:50.312 --> 01:25:51.521
She died, Kimberly.

01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:56.150
What?

01:25:57.110 --> 01:25:58.861
She... She died.

01:26:10.749 --> 01:26:12.124
Mama?

01:26:19.424 --> 01:26:21.467
Mama. Mama!

01:26:23.387 --> 01:26:24.387
No!

01:26:26.890 --> 01:26:30.601
No, no, no. Mama, I'm sorry.
Mama, I'm sorry!

01:26:31.979 --> 01:26:36.858
I've got to say, if we could see Sister Shirley
up in heaven,

01:26:37.025 --> 01:26:38.818
this is what Shirley would say.

01:27:20.027 --> 01:27:21.235
Come on, Sister Laura.

01:29:09.136 --> 01:29:12.388
Glory to God! Thank you, Father.

01:29:50.927 --> 01:29:52.261
We sang it at the funeral.

01:29:52.345 --> 01:29:54.180
I don't want to hear, "This is your mommy."

01:29:54.264 --> 01:29:55.556
I could've had grandkids.

01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:57.058
I don't wanna hear that.
I don't wanna hear that.

01:29:57.142 --> 01:30:00.311
At all. Please.
But I just wanna thank ya'll for coming.

01:30:00.395 --> 01:30:01.395
- It was a nice service.
- Yes.

01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:03.189
- Was it?
- Yes. Yeah.

01:30:03.273 --> 01:30:05.941
You should've came, Madea. That nice
dress, you should've came to the funeral.

01:30:06.026 --> 01:30:08.611
You know I ain't going to no funeral.
All that noise, that loud singing,

01:30:08.695 --> 01:30:10.321
slow walking, working on my nerve, child.

01:30:10.405 --> 01:30:12.281
I can't be bothered with that.
People dead, they dead.

01:30:12.365 --> 01:30:15.409
I ain't fittin' to be bothered with all that.
All right now. Good to see y'all.

01:30:15.577 --> 01:30:16.577
Are you okay?

01:30:17.037 --> 01:30:19.371
My mother just died. What do you think?

01:30:19.456 --> 01:30:20.664
Look, I'm just trying to be here for you.

01:30:20.749 --> 01:30:22.333
Well, I don't want you to be here for me,
Calvin.

01:30:22.417 --> 01:30:24.001
- Kimberly.
- No. Please.

01:30:24.669 --> 01:30:26.128
Lord have mercy...

01:30:27.005 --> 01:30:29.048
See, no, you better get her, Byron.

01:30:29.132 --> 01:30:33.552
Hey, stop that. Stop that. Stop that.
Hey, hey, hey. Stop it.

01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:34.720
Stop it. Stop it.

01:30:34.805 --> 01:30:37.098
Lord have mercy. It's always the same thing.

01:30:40.268 --> 01:30:43.187
Hey, hey! Shut the hell up!
Sound like a siren.

01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:45.231
Come in here and sit. Shut up!

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:49.068
Sit down, you black leprechaun,

01:30:49.152 --> 01:30:52.029
looking like you out of a box of
Chocolate Lucky Charms.

01:30:52.114 --> 01:30:53.906
Whole family. I'm sick of this.

01:30:55.659 --> 01:30:59.703
Now look here.
Your mama was a peaceful woman.

01:30:59.788 --> 01:31:02.790
She did not want all this foolishness.
She did the best she could with y'all,

01:31:02.874 --> 01:31:04.458
but all of y'all act like
y'all ain't got no sense.

01:31:04.543 --> 01:31:06.377
You, little leprechaun.
Let me tell you something...

01:31:06.503 --> 01:31:08.754
Stop using that baby to
make this man's life miserable.

01:31:08.839 --> 01:31:09.839
That's right.

01:31:10.257 --> 01:31:12.091
I didn't ask for no amen from you.
I will punch...

01:31:12.175 --> 01:31:14.552
I will punch the hell out of you.
Say something else.

01:31:16.638 --> 01:31:18.764
The man don't want you.
He done moved the hell on.

01:31:18.849 --> 01:31:21.183
You can't get to what's in front of you,
'cause you're too busy looking

01:31:21.268 --> 01:31:23.769
to see what the hell he doing with this girl.
Move on.

01:31:23.854 --> 01:31:26.355
Stop or that child will grow up resenting
you for that. Do you hear me?

01:31:26.439 --> 01:31:27.439
That is a human being.

01:31:27.524 --> 01:31:31.318
That is not some pawn that you can use
to make this man's life miserable.

01:31:31.403 --> 01:31:32.403
Stop doing it.

01:31:32.487 --> 01:31:34.321
'Cause if I catch you doing it,
I'm gonna beat the hell out of you.

01:31:34.406 --> 01:31:36.782
Do you understand? You don't know me.
You don't want none of this.

01:31:36.867 --> 01:31:38.075
This is old "whoop your ass."

01:31:38.201 --> 01:31:41.162
And old "whoop your ass" is much worse
than new "whoop your ass."

01:31:41.246 --> 01:31:44.498
New "whoop your ass" get up off you,
old "whoop your ass" have you in the grave.

01:31:44.583 --> 01:31:48.127
Do you want some old "whoop your ass"?
Do you want some old "whoop your ass"?

01:31:51.548 --> 01:31:53.716
And you, out there selling dope.

01:31:54.551 --> 01:31:56.635
Yeah, she's a snitch.
She told me you out there selling dope,

01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:59.096
giving this girl all the money.
Can't give her $20 for some Pampers?

01:31:59.222 --> 01:32:00.264
What the hell wrong with you?

01:32:00.348 --> 01:32:02.641
A man take care of his baby
without anybody telling him

01:32:02.726 --> 01:32:03.934
he need to take care of his baby.

01:32:04.227 --> 01:32:07.563
Get a job. Go to work.
Do you understand what I am telling you?

01:32:07.689 --> 01:32:10.316
Y'all them young folk, born around the '80s,
something happened to 'em.

01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:12.193
Y'all feel like y'all don't have to
work for nothing,

01:32:12.319 --> 01:32:14.570
somebody's supposed to hand
something to you,

01:32:14.738 --> 01:32:16.655
forgetting that old folks marched
for your dumb ass,

01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:18.616
to get you where you can be and to be free.

01:32:18.742 --> 01:32:20.367
That dope either gonna lead you to
one of two places:

01:32:20.452 --> 01:32:22.578
To the grave or to prison.
Now you've already been to prison.

01:32:22.662 --> 01:32:23.787
You ready to go back to jail?

01:32:23.872 --> 01:32:25.164
You ready to go to the grave?
Which one you want?

01:32:25.457 --> 01:32:27.166
'Cause as soon as you go down,
this one right here

01:32:27.250 --> 01:32:28.375
is going to be sold to the highest bidder.

01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:30.961
All she looking for is some money.
Say something. I dare you.

01:32:31.213 --> 01:32:34.256
I double-D dare you to say something.

01:32:36.009 --> 01:32:37.551
I'm gonna tell you right now,
I will be checking in with

01:32:37.636 --> 01:32:40.221
this side of the family from time to time.
And y'all better have it together.

01:32:40.305 --> 01:32:42.598
You two. You better be F. Lee Bailey,
you better be Johnnie Cochran.

01:32:42.682 --> 01:32:43.682
I want to see a settlement.

01:32:43.767 --> 01:32:44.975
I want to know
who's going to have the baby,

01:32:45.060 --> 01:32:46.268
who gonna pick him up,
who gonna have Pampers,

01:32:46.353 --> 01:32:47.436
when you gonna come
and give the child support,

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:49.313
when is the money gonna be there.
You better write it all down.

01:32:49.397 --> 01:32:50.981
Do you hear what I'm tellin' you, son?

01:32:51.942 --> 01:32:53.359
Your mama did not want ya'll to know this.

01:32:53.443 --> 01:32:54.693
- Madea.
- Shut up.

01:32:55.445 --> 01:32:57.947
She wanted to keep this hidden from y'all,
but I'm gonna tell y'all.

01:32:58.031 --> 01:33:00.115
You arguing and fussing with this girl,
she fussing.

01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:02.117
She mad at the world.
Honey, you know why you be so mad?

01:33:02.244 --> 01:33:04.787
This child was raped by your uncle
at 12 years old.

01:33:05.121 --> 01:33:07.748
Anything that's covered up don't get healed.
That's what's wrong with people.

01:33:07.832 --> 01:33:10.834
Keep trying to cover things up,
and covered up. That don't help nobody.

01:33:10.919 --> 01:33:12.461
I can't stand nobody sitting around saying,

01:33:12.629 --> 01:33:14.546
"What goes on in this house stays in
this house."

01:33:14.631 --> 01:33:16.715
Let me explain something to you.
Whatever went on in that house,

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:19.218
if you're getting hurt by it
and it's tearing you up in your adult life,

01:33:19.302 --> 01:33:20.302
you need to go get some help.

01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:22.471
This man is trying to love you
and you acting like a fool.

01:33:22.555 --> 01:33:25.057
Always grouchy and mean.
And the reason you so nasty, honey,

01:33:25.141 --> 01:33:26.725
you ain't forgave the man that raped you.

01:33:26.977 --> 01:33:29.311
You got to forgive those people, honey.
Not for them, but for you.

01:33:29.396 --> 01:33:31.105
If you don't, they take power over you.

01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:33.691
Do you hear me?
Forgive him for your own sake.

01:33:34.025 --> 01:33:35.109
This man is trying to love you.

01:33:35.193 --> 01:33:36.694
Go talk to him, act like you got some sense.

01:33:36.778 --> 01:33:39.905
Go on upstairs and talk to the man.
Go on, talk to him.

01:34:03.805 --> 01:34:08.392
You know, my mama used to
rock me to sleep in here.

01:34:10.562 --> 01:34:11.603
At the hospital,

01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:18.027
she told me to tell you that she loved you.

01:34:19.696 --> 01:34:23.365
And that she was sorry
and she felt like she failed you.

01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:27.870
She said that?

01:34:29.372 --> 01:34:32.166
Yeah. Baby, why didn't you tell me?

01:34:33.084 --> 01:34:35.085
I didn't know how.

01:34:36.713 --> 01:34:39.131
I want to hold you. Can I?

01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:41.550
Please.

01:34:44.471 --> 01:34:46.096
We're going to get some help.

01:34:47.724 --> 01:34:48.724
I love you.

01:34:52.062 --> 01:34:54.313
I love you. I'm so sorry.

01:34:54.397 --> 01:34:57.358
- Baby, I love you.
- I'm so sorry, baby.

01:34:59.736 --> 01:35:02.196
Come on, baby, let's go.
Roscoe's waiting for you.

01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:04.281
- I'm not doing it.
- You... What?

01:35:04.824 --> 01:35:06.033
I'm not doing it.

01:35:06.284 --> 01:35:07.659
Byron, we need the money.

01:35:08.119 --> 01:35:10.287
Listen, I don't need the money that bad.
All right?

01:35:10.705 --> 01:35:12.748
Get some heart, Byron. Damn.

01:35:12.916 --> 01:35:16.126
Are you really gonna sit up here
and let that old lady tell you what to do?

01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:19.505
- We need the money, Byron.
- Listen to me.

01:35:21.341 --> 01:35:24.760
I just buried my mother today and you
wanna come in and you wanna talk...

01:35:26.930 --> 01:35:30.224
You know what, move.

01:35:33.770 --> 01:35:35.938
Get out, get out.

01:35:37.774 --> 01:35:41.026
- Fine. With your broke ass.
- Yeah.

01:35:44.948 --> 01:35:46.907
I ain't need you anyway.

01:35:49.577 --> 01:35:50.869
I'm so glad you here.

01:35:50.954 --> 01:35:52.496
That's right.
They don't even know what to say.

01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:54.039
I told you, I told you.

01:35:54.666 --> 01:35:55.666
What's wrong with you?

01:35:56.126 --> 01:35:57.876
It's nice what you did for this family, Madea.

01:35:58.044 --> 01:35:59.461
- Yes, it is. Praise the Lord.
- It is.

01:35:59.712 --> 01:36:01.338
But you can't even do it
for your own daughter.

01:36:03.216 --> 01:36:05.217
- Did she just go off on me?
- Sound like she did.

01:36:05.468 --> 01:36:06.593
What you talking about, Cora?

01:36:06.886 --> 01:36:09.221
My daddy, Madea.
You don't even know who...

01:36:09.305 --> 01:36:12.182
That is your daddy,
that silverback standing over there.

01:36:12.267 --> 01:36:14.101
Madea... Well, prove it, then. Prove it.

01:36:15.103 --> 01:36:16.311
- Prove it, then?
- Yes. Prove it to me.

01:36:16.396 --> 01:36:18.105
How the hell I'm supposed
to prove it to you?

01:36:18.481 --> 01:36:19.815
Prove it. Yes.

01:36:21.734 --> 01:36:23.110
How you doing, Marley Kovitch?

01:36:23.194 --> 01:36:26.905
Yeah. Okay. Nice to see you, Mr. Brown.
I know this is very upsetting to you.

01:36:27.115 --> 01:36:28.824
- Yes, sir.
- 'Cause after all these years,

01:36:28.908 --> 01:36:32.035
you're gonna find out
whether Brown is your father.

01:36:32.829 --> 01:36:35.831
All these years,
I just found out he was my daddy.

01:36:36.291 --> 01:36:37.833
And now she's trying to say that...

01:36:38.001 --> 01:36:41.128
And Cora look just like me.
Tell me she don't look just like me.

01:36:41.254 --> 01:36:43.839
- Really?
- Yes. Look at her eyes.

01:36:44.132 --> 01:36:48.260
You can't tell me her eyes and her hair...
Well, she didn't comb her hair that day.

01:36:48.344 --> 01:36:50.721
But she look just like me, Marley.

01:36:51.181 --> 01:36:54.266
So, Cora, when you were growing up,
who did you think your father was?

01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:56.560
I didn't know, Maury. I didn't know.

01:36:56.728 --> 01:37:01.190
But Mr. Brown always acted like my father,
so it came easy once Madea told me.

01:37:01.399 --> 01:37:02.858
When did Madea tell you?

01:37:03.401 --> 01:37:04.902
I was, like, 40-something.

01:37:05.028 --> 01:37:06.820
- Forty-something?
- Yes.

01:37:06.988 --> 01:37:09.781
- Okay, you all have talked a lot about this.
- Yeah.

01:37:09.866 --> 01:37:11.867
But we haven't heard from Madea.

01:37:12.035 --> 01:37:14.411
And this is what Madea had to say
to my producers.

01:37:14.704 --> 01:37:18.540
Brown is a lowdown dirty...
He is a liar, he is a cheater.

01:37:18.625 --> 01:37:20.584
He ain't never did
like he was supposed to do for Cora.

01:37:20.668 --> 01:37:22.127
He gonna act like he... He wanted to act like

01:37:22.212 --> 01:37:24.213
he done went to the doctor
and found out he ain't the baby daddy.

01:37:24.297 --> 01:37:26.340
He is the baby daddy.
And I'm gonna tell you right now, Maury,

01:37:26.424 --> 01:37:28.091
I'm gonna tell you right now
I know that's the baby daddy.

01:37:28.176 --> 01:37:30.969
'Cause that is the only baby daddy
that I had a baby daddy with.

01:37:31.054 --> 01:37:32.971
He is the baby daddy.
If he ain't the baby daddy...

01:37:33.056 --> 01:37:34.640
I know he's the baby daddy 'cause I know...

01:37:34.724 --> 01:37:36.517
I know that was the worst
15 seconds of my life.

01:37:36.601 --> 01:37:38.977
So I know that's the baby daddy.
You ain't even got to worry about,

01:37:39.062 --> 01:37:41.647
'cause I know that was the baby daddy.
Cora ain't got to figure it out.

01:37:41.731 --> 01:37:43.815
But when I go up there,
I'm gonna show... I'm gonna say it all.

01:37:43.900 --> 01:37:45.567
'Cause he's so damn stupid,
he don't even want nobody

01:37:45.652 --> 01:37:47.069
to tell nobody
what the hell he's supposed to do.

01:37:47.153 --> 01:37:48.153
But I know that's the baby daddy.

01:37:48.238 --> 01:37:49.947
Y'all ain't gotta tell me,
'cause I know that's the baby daddy.

01:37:50.031 --> 01:37:51.990
I can't wait till I get up in there.
When I get on that stage,

01:37:52.075 --> 01:37:53.492
I'm gonna tell Maury all the truth.

01:37:53.743 --> 01:37:56.870
So why don't we just meet her?
Everybody, here's Madea.

01:37:56.955 --> 01:37:58.080
Madea, come on out.

01:37:58.248 --> 01:38:01.083
Bring her out here, Marley.
Bring her out here, Marley.

01:38:02.627 --> 01:38:05.420
- Madea, nice to see you.
- How you doing, Maury?

01:38:06.214 --> 01:38:07.756
I've been trying to tell you,
you are the daddy.

01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:11.468
You the daddy, you the daddy.
That's your baby. This is your baby.

01:38:11.636 --> 01:38:12.761
Madea!

01:38:13.012 --> 01:38:15.514
- That's your baby! That's your baby!
- Madea! Madea!

01:38:15.598 --> 01:38:17.933
That's your baby! That's your baby!

01:38:18.059 --> 01:38:20.018
- That's your baby!
- Please! Madea, sit down.

01:38:20.103 --> 01:38:21.270
- Please, Madea.
- Okay.

01:38:22.230 --> 01:38:26.149
Why did you wait until Cora was in her 40s
to tell her who her father was?

01:38:26.234 --> 01:38:27.651
That's because she dumb.

01:38:27.986 --> 01:38:29.653
- What?
- Rum-dum-di-di dumb.

01:38:30.321 --> 01:38:33.407
Say one more thing. Say one more... thing.

01:38:34.492 --> 01:38:35.784
- Madea, please.
- You got one more time.

01:38:35.994 --> 01:38:39.580
Now, I didn't tell her, I didn't tell her
'cause it wasn't important.

01:38:40.248 --> 01:38:41.456
I took care of her.

01:38:41.666 --> 01:38:44.126
I gave her everything she needed.
She didn't need to know.

01:38:44.419 --> 01:38:46.253
She did not even need to know
who her daddy was.

01:38:46.462 --> 01:38:51.550
I'm more interested now in Cora,
and having both of her parents in her life.

01:38:51.634 --> 01:38:52.718
- That's right. That's right.
- Yeah.

01:38:52.802 --> 01:38:54.386
I don't know why.
Hell, she ain't five years old.

01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:56.972
I don't even know why, Cora,
you all got me on this... television.

01:38:57.140 --> 01:38:58.807
Acting like you ain't got no...

01:38:59.017 --> 01:39:01.518
And I... You said...

01:39:01.811 --> 01:39:03.312
I know, Madea, who my...

01:39:08.818 --> 01:39:12.029
...say that, Madea. Don't be like that.

01:39:12.864 --> 01:39:15.365
Right, this the father. He is the father.
You are the father.

01:39:15.533 --> 01:39:17.409
- You are the father. You are the father.
- Okay, now, wait a minute.

01:39:17.619 --> 01:39:19.369
You are the father. You are the father.

01:39:19.537 --> 01:39:20.704
- You are the father.
- Madea!

01:39:20.788 --> 01:39:23.040
- You are the... father.
- Madea!

01:39:25.376 --> 01:39:27.336
- Sit out here with all the...
- There's only one way to settle this.

01:39:27.670 --> 01:39:29.588
Yeah, let's figure it out. Bring it on, Maury.
Bring it on.

01:39:29.672 --> 01:39:31.048
- We're gonna have the answer right here.
- Bring it on.

01:39:31.132 --> 01:39:35.010
He the daddy. You the daddy.
You the daddy. You the daddy.

01:39:35.094 --> 01:39:37.804
You the daddy. Tell him, tell him, Maury.
Tell him. You are the father.

01:39:37.889 --> 01:39:38.930
Tell him, Maury. Tell him.

01:39:39.015 --> 01:39:41.725
In the case of
58-year-old Cora Jean Simmons,

01:39:42.185 --> 01:39:45.479
Brown, you are not the father.

01:39:50.068 --> 01:39:53.528
- Madea!
- Madea, why'd you have to do this to me?

01:39:55.239 --> 01:39:57.658
Madea! Don't do that. Don't do that.

01:39:57.742 --> 01:40:00.369
Don't embarrass yourself
on my show, Madea.

01:40:00.578 --> 01:40:02.954
- Madea, Madea, Madea.
- I thought he was the daddy, Maury!

01:40:03.206 --> 01:40:04.873
- I thought he was the daddy, Maury!
- No, no, no.

01:40:05.208 --> 01:40:08.126
- I thought he was the daddy, Maury!
- He's not the father.

01:40:08.211 --> 01:40:11.463
Call 1-800-Choke-That-Ho. I like that.

01:40:11.631 --> 01:40:14.800
I'm a ho, Maury.
I'm just a no-good ho, Maury.

01:40:14.926 --> 01:40:15.926
Marker.

01:40:16.386 --> 01:40:18.762
Doc, are those your real eyes
or them contacts?

01:40:18.971 --> 01:40:19.971
They're real.

01:40:20.056 --> 01:40:21.390
- What?
- Yes, sir.

01:40:21.808 --> 01:40:24.434
Doctor, are those your eyes?
Are those your eyes?

01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:26.728
- Yes, sir, they are.
- What?

01:40:27.230 --> 01:40:28.897
You look like an albilo.

01:40:30.358 --> 01:40:33.402
This could be the last time
that you get to hold me.

01:40:33.569 --> 01:40:35.737
- Just...
- Madea!

01:40:36.572 --> 01:40:37.572
What the...

01:40:38.491 --> 01:40:40.992
- I think I broke my...
- Let's do the slap again.

01:40:41.244 --> 01:40:44.329
Come on, reset. I'm getting warmed up.

01:40:46.416 --> 01:40:50.001
Mabel, I went to the doctor and they say
I'm dying. I ain't got but a week left.

01:40:50.169 --> 01:40:51.420
You are not dying, Mr. Brown.

01:40:51.504 --> 01:40:53.505
You had a colonoscopy
and they found a growth

01:40:53.589 --> 01:40:55.173
and they wanna remove it and do a biopsy.

01:40:55.258 --> 01:40:56.508
Cora, you don't know
what you're talking about.

01:40:56.592 --> 01:40:58.135
- You ain't no doctor.
- That's what he said.

01:40:58.261 --> 01:41:00.637
- That ain't what he said. You a doctor?
- It is.

01:41:00.972 --> 01:41:03.932
That's what I thought. You ain't no doctor
so you don't know doctor stuff.

01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:07.352
Shut up! Heller? Yes. Hold on.

01:41:07.437 --> 01:41:09.396
Kirk Franklin's calling you.
He wants you back.

01:41:10.106 --> 01:41:11.106
All right, we cut.

01:41:13.276 --> 01:41:14.735
And don't be so sad.

01:41:14.944 --> 01:41:17.696
You're subject to walk out of here
and get hit by a bus.

01:41:17.780 --> 01:41:19.322
You never know, baby.

01:41:19.449 --> 01:41:23.827
That bus will run right over you,
just splatter you all over the pavement.

01:41:23.911 --> 01:41:25.746
Honey, it could be ugly.

01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:28.331
God does things like that.
You just never know.

01:41:28.416 --> 01:41:30.292
But thank you so much.

01:41:31.169 --> 01:41:32.377
We cut.

01:41:33.629 --> 01:41:36.214
And I ain't finding out what he done
found out because he don't wanna...

01:41:38.342 --> 01:41:40.427
- Good he found out.
- Yes, good he found out.

01:41:40.511 --> 01:41:42.637
Because once you find out
what you didn't find out

01:41:42.722 --> 01:41:43.889
then you'd know what you didn't know.

01:41:43.973 --> 01:41:45.557
And once you know what you don't know

01:41:45.641 --> 01:41:47.476
then it don't make no difference
what you don't know no more,

01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:49.394
'cause then you don't find out
what you didn't know.

01:41:49.479 --> 01:41:50.896
And once you found out
what you don't know...

01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:51.980
- Bam, Bam.
...it makes no difference

01:41:52.064 --> 01:41:53.482
- what you didn't know no more.
- Bam.

01:41:53.566 --> 01:41:54.608
Because when you find out...

01:41:54.692 --> 01:41:56.526
- Bam.
...then you can know what...

01:41:56.611 --> 01:41:59.070
Some smoking weed, Bam.
Stop smoking all that damn weed.

01:41:59.155 --> 01:42:00.530
- Let me tell you something.
- We cut.

01:42:00.615 --> 01:42:02.032
- Oh, y'all...
- Cut.

01:42:03.075 --> 01:42:05.035
Who's gonna pass us that?

01:42:05.119 --> 01:42:07.579
Your lazy ass won't even get up
and go get the food and bring it down...

01:42:07.663 --> 01:42:09.164
I'm not gonna get that. Harold!

01:42:10.708 --> 01:42:12.751
Bam, you gonna call Harold
to bring the food down here?

01:42:12.835 --> 01:42:15.086
- At least somebody.
- That's lazy as hell.

01:42:15.171 --> 01:42:17.005
Well, what do you want me to do?
Get up and get it?

01:42:17.089 --> 01:42:19.341
Yes. Because I sure in hell ain't gonna get it.

01:42:20.176 --> 01:42:22.928
H.J., come here. Come here.

01:42:23.012 --> 01:42:24.429
I got... This what children are for here.

01:42:24.514 --> 01:42:26.264
That's why you don't buy a remote control,
you have children.

01:42:26.349 --> 01:42:27.390
- That's right.
- Yeah. That's why

01:42:27.475 --> 01:42:29.476
you don't need vacuum cleaners or nothing.
Children do all that.

01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:31.937
Well, they got two of them.
You use one, I use the other one.

01:42:32.021 --> 01:42:34.105
- Yeah, okay. Which one do you want?
- I want that little one.

01:42:34.190 --> 01:42:35.774
Bring the food out. We cut.

01:42:55.086 --> 01:42:56.837
We cut. Did you get it?

01:42:58.172 --> 01:42:59.381
Sit down!

01:43:00.132 --> 01:43:02.133
Sittin' there like you on a horse.

01:43:03.094 --> 01:43:06.221
Let me tell all of you something,
and I want to make this clear.

01:43:08.558 --> 01:43:10.058
If your mama ain't here

01:43:10.142 --> 01:43:13.603
then your Daddy gonna tell you
what you need to do.

01:43:13.688 --> 01:43:14.771
What?

01:43:15.231 --> 01:43:16.314
Cut.

01:43:16.732 --> 01:43:18.024
...tell you what's going on.
- What?

01:43:18.109 --> 01:43:22.988
You found out that this was your daughter
just like recently?

01:43:23.072 --> 01:43:24.322
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:43:24.407 --> 01:43:25.490
- I was 40-something.
- It was terrible.

01:43:25.575 --> 01:43:26.616
What was that like?

01:43:26.701 --> 01:43:29.619
I was happy, you know, but I was sad.

01:43:29.704 --> 01:43:31.663
'Cause it was the best thing
that ever happened.

01:43:31.747 --> 01:43:32.998
Why was you sad, Cora?

01:43:33.082 --> 01:43:36.835
Because, at first,
I didn't want it to be him to be my daddy.

01:43:36.919 --> 01:43:38.420
- Why?
- But then...

01:43:38.504 --> 01:43:41.131
Because, you know, look at him.
But he wound up being...

01:43:41.215 --> 01:43:43.383
- Cora, look at you.
- It worked out.

01:43:43.467 --> 01:43:44.885
You ain't no catch either.

01:43:44.969 --> 01:43:47.137
Cora, I'm trying to help, do you a favor.

01:43:47.930 --> 01:43:51.308
But what did Madea tell you all your life
about your father?

01:43:51.392 --> 01:43:52.475
Like you better than me.

01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:53.852
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

01:43:53.936 --> 01:43:55.353
My security people, please.

01:43:55.438 --> 01:43:57.647
Ain't nobody scared of no security.
Because I can take them...

01:43:57.732 --> 01:44:01.192
Don't touch me. I will bust you in your head
with this hammer. Back the hell up.

01:44:01.277 --> 01:44:02.319
- Madea, please.
- I'm not scared.

01:44:02.403 --> 01:44:03.778
I will bust you in your head
with this hammer.

01:44:03.863 --> 01:44:04.863
- Madea, please.
- Ma'am, come on.

01:44:04.947 --> 01:44:07.407
We're not gonna stand for that on this show.
Come on now.

01:44:07.491 --> 01:44:08.783
I don't wanna sit by her!

01:44:08.868 --> 01:44:11.077
Get out of the way.
You're in front of the camera. Move.

01:44:11.162 --> 01:44:13.246
- Okay. Just sit down here.
- I ain't gonna sit down.

01:44:13.331 --> 01:44:15.081
You're in front of the camera.
Get your ass out of the way

01:44:15.166 --> 01:44:16.791
- is what I'm telling you.
- Madea.

01:44:16.876 --> 01:44:18.668
- She's telling you to slide over.
- Hey, you still ain't moving.

01:44:18.753 --> 01:44:19.836
You're in the way.

01:44:21.547 --> 01:44:24.341
I'm serious.
Your ass is in front of the camera. Move.

01:44:27.970 --> 01:44:30.889
All right. Y'all go on, now, go on.
Get the hell off the stage.

01:44:30.973 --> 01:44:31.973
Y'all extras.

01:44:32.099 --> 01:44:35.769
Why did you wait until Cora was in her 40s
to tell her who her father was?

01:44:35.853 --> 01:44:36.978
That's because she's dumb.

01:44:37.063 --> 01:44:40.065
I didn't tell her because it wasn't important.

01:44:41.901 --> 01:44:43.902
It was not important to her.

01:44:43.986 --> 01:44:46.613
Because I took care of her.

01:44:46.697 --> 01:44:48.907
- You were like father and mother?
- Yeah.

01:44:48.991 --> 01:44:50.158
And...

01:44:50.576 --> 01:44:55.121
- I ain't never hit no woman, but I'm gonna...
- No, no, no, no, no!

01:44:55.206 --> 01:44:57.540
- No, let me, let me...
- No, no, no!

01:44:57.667 --> 01:44:59.542
No, we can't have that on my show.

01:44:59.835 --> 01:45:03.880
- I love you, man.
- I know. Oh, gentle. Mr. Brown, I know.

01:45:04.715 --> 01:45:07.509
- I know. I know. I know.
- I'm having a nervous breakdown.

01:45:07.635 --> 01:45:09.094
I want you to be my daddy.

01:45:09.178 --> 01:45:11.012
But I want to be your man now.

01:45:11.138 --> 01:45:12.722
What? Now what...

01:45:14.183 --> 01:45:16.184
Thank you for coming to this movie.
