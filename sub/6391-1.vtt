05:11.395 --> 05:15.232
- We got to get back.
- See ya, Matt.

05:20.404 --> 05:22.197
Come through here.

05:31.039 --> 05:32.875
Strip down.

05:50.642 --> 05:52.394
Open up.

07:41.587 --> 07:43.672
Welcome to Alcatraz.

08:08.655 --> 08:11.533
Inside B and C! Count them!

08:27.382 --> 08:31.887
- 25 on inside C, first tier.
- 20 inside B, first tier.

08:32.011 --> 08:36.390
- 23 on inside C, second tier.
- 17 inside B, second tier.

08:41.020 --> 08:44.566
Break out! Inside B and C.

08:59.957 --> 09:01.959
Move!

09:03.627 --> 09:06.171
Better button your collar, boy.

09:54.052 --> 09:55.929
No forks.

09:57.431 --> 09:59.516
Hey, no forks.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.810
Do you see any?

10:48.065 --> 10:51.318
Fresh fish, you want your pasta?

10:51.401 --> 10:53.695
Hey, you want your pasta?

10:53.779 --> 10:55.697
Do you see any?

10:59.076 --> 11:02.120
I see pasta in my sleep.

11:41.159 --> 11:43.203
I'm Litmus.

11:46.498 --> 11:48.500
Like litmus paper.

11:48.625 --> 11:51.545
When it's cold, my face gets blue.

11:51.628 --> 11:54.548
When it's hot, my face gets red.

12:14.526 --> 12:16.820
Inside C, move out.

12:29.958 --> 12:32.127
Warden wants to see you.

12:58.028 --> 13:01.532
- Name?
- Morris.

13:01.657 --> 13:03.492
That's funny.

13:03.575 --> 13:08.080
This file says Frank Lee Morris.

13:13.919 --> 13:17.965
If you disobey the rules of society,
they send you to prison.

13:18.090 --> 13:22.219
If you disobey the rules of prison,
they send you to us.

13:26.682 --> 13:32.521
Alcatraz is not like any other
prison in the United States.

13:32.604 --> 13:38.527
Here, every inmate is confined alone

13:38.610 --> 13:41.905
to an individual cell.

13:41.989 --> 13:43.907
Unlike my predecessors,

13:43.991 --> 13:45.909
wardens Johnson and Blackwell,

13:45.993 --> 13:48.912
I don't have good conduct programs.

13:48.996 --> 13:51.999
I do not have inmate councils.

13:52.082 --> 13:55.169
Inmates have no say in what they do.

13:55.294 --> 13:57.171
They do as they're told.

13:57.296 --> 13:59.173
You are not permitted

13:59.298 --> 14:01.925
to have newspapers
or magazines carrying news.

14:02.009 --> 14:05.846
Knowledge of the outside world
is what we tell you.

14:08.682 --> 14:10.976
From this day on,

14:11.059 --> 14:16.773
your world will be everything
that happens in this building.

14:16.899 --> 14:19.151
You will shave once a day.

14:19.234 --> 14:21.486
You will shower twice a week.

14:21.570 --> 14:24.364
You will cut your hair once a month.

14:25.407 --> 14:28.285
Now, your privileges.

14:28.410 --> 14:31.497
You can talk. You can work.
Other institutions hand out work,

14:31.580 --> 14:34.625
but here it's a privilege
that you earn.

14:34.708 --> 14:38.128
I promise you it's
a privilege that you'll want.

14:38.212 --> 14:40.547
Visitors...
you're allowed two a month.

14:40.631 --> 14:44.968
They cannot be former inmates
of this or any other federal prison.

14:45.052 --> 14:49.556
All names that you submit will
be carefully checked by the FBl.

14:49.640 --> 14:52.434
What names do you have in mind?

14:53.977 --> 14:56.021
I can't think of any offhand.

14:58.065 --> 14:59.691
Family members?

15:00.984 --> 15:03.529
None. No family.

15:05.656 --> 15:10.536
Alcatraz is
a maximum security prison

15:10.619 --> 15:13.539
with very few privileges.

15:13.664 --> 15:15.541
We don't make good citizens,

15:15.624 --> 15:17.960
but we make good prisoners.

15:18.043 --> 15:21.922
Burglary, armed robbery,

15:22.047 --> 15:24.967
grand larceny...

15:25.050 --> 15:28.554
You've escaped from
quite a few prisons, haven't you?

15:30.013 --> 15:32.391
That's why you're here.

15:32.474 --> 15:36.937
Alcatraz was built to keep
all the rotten eggs in one basket.

15:37.020 --> 15:38.772
I was specially chosen

15:38.897 --> 15:42.568
to ensure that the stink
from the basket does not escape.

15:42.651 --> 15:45.946
Since I've been warden
some have tried to escape.

15:46.071 --> 15:50.784
Most have been recaptured.
Those who haven't have been killed

15:50.868 --> 15:52.953
or drowned in the bay.

15:53.078 --> 15:56.123
No one has ever escaped
from Alcatraz.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.171
And no one ever will.

17:21.208 --> 17:25.253
- You two go everywhere together?
- Sure. Even to bed together.

17:25.337 --> 17:27.214
When I wash, he washes.

17:27.339 --> 17:30.717
That way we sleep
nice-nice together. Capisce?

17:50.445 --> 17:51.738
I'm Wolf.

17:54.032 --> 17:56.577
Where did they transfer you from?

17:56.660 --> 17:58.078
Atlanta.

17:59.246 --> 18:02.583
Nice town, Atlanta.

18:02.666 --> 18:04.543
I never saw it.

18:09.631 --> 18:13.302
I'm looking for a new punk.

18:17.639 --> 18:19.391
Good luck.

18:20.517 --> 18:24.438
You don't understand.
I just found her.

18:32.029 --> 18:34.740
Why don't you show her
what you can do?

18:56.553 --> 18:59.973
Morris, I need somebody
in the library.

19:00.057 --> 19:03.143
- Take him over there, will you?
- Yes, captain. Move.

19:22.037 --> 19:24.289
What you want, boy?

19:24.373 --> 19:27.042
The bull sent me down here to work.

19:27.125 --> 19:29.753
Can you read, boy?

19:31.463 --> 19:34.550
As long as it's in
the English language, boy.

19:41.598 --> 19:43.767
You treat them all like Wolf?

19:43.851 --> 19:47.062
Wolf wanted to get friendly.
I didn't.

19:48.647 --> 19:51.984
You'll take that cart to the cells.

19:52.067 --> 19:55.571
Don't they let cons down here?

19:55.654 --> 19:57.531
You see any chairs?

19:57.614 --> 19:59.575
How come?

19:59.658 --> 20:02.578
Because this is The Rock, man.

20:02.661 --> 20:07.958
They don't want you
doing anything here, but time...

20:08.041 --> 20:11.545
Hard friggin' time.

20:11.628 --> 20:14.590
Rock affects dudes differently.

20:14.673 --> 20:17.551
It either brings out your strength,

20:17.634 --> 20:19.469
or it breaks you.

20:21.763 --> 20:24.057
What did it do for you?

20:26.768 --> 20:28.979
What happens when you get out?

20:29.062 --> 20:31.106
I won't.

20:32.691 --> 20:34.026
10 years ago...

20:36.737 --> 20:38.780
I was in this bar in Alabama

20:38.864 --> 20:41.950
when two dudes
started hassling me.

20:42.034 --> 20:44.578
That was their first mistake.

20:44.661 --> 20:48.373
They pulled knives.
That was their second mistake.

20:48.457 --> 20:50.792
They didn't know how to use them.

20:50.876 --> 20:53.962
That was the last
mistake they ever made.

20:54.046 --> 20:59.218
I got two 99-year
sentences back-to-back.

21:01.678 --> 21:05.933
Seems like you could have
pleaded self-defence.

21:06.016 --> 21:09.561
The dudes were white, man,

21:09.645 --> 21:11.605
just like you.

21:15.651 --> 21:20.989
When I arrived they put me in one
of those dark cells in D-block.

21:21.073 --> 21:23.575
After a while, I went stir crazy.

21:23.659 --> 21:26.703
Sliced my Achilles'
tendon to get out.

21:27.830 --> 21:30.749
You'll see why when you see D-block.

21:30.833 --> 21:34.002
Tell me something,
you through killing white guys?

21:34.086 --> 21:36.588
- Why?
- Well, I don't know.

21:36.672 --> 21:41.051
I just figured
I wouldn't turn my back on you.

21:47.057 --> 21:48.976
Hey.

21:49.059 --> 21:51.562
What's your name, man?

21:51.645 --> 21:53.814
Frank. What's yours?

21:55.023 --> 21:56.817
English.

21:56.900 --> 21:58.777
See you later.

22:07.744 --> 22:09.788
- Your name?
- Morris.

22:15.210 --> 22:16.628
OK.

22:31.685 --> 22:34.897
- Magazine or book?
- Where's English?

22:34.980 --> 22:39.693
What did they do,
give a nigger a nigger of his own?

22:43.906 --> 22:45.365
Magazine?

22:49.411 --> 22:52.998
- Hi! I'm Bugsy.
- Magazine or book?

22:53.081 --> 22:55.626
Thanks. Hey, you're new.

22:55.709 --> 22:56.752
Yeah.

22:56.877 --> 22:58.879
Hey, wait, wait a minute.

22:58.962 --> 23:02.049
I haven't seen a new guy
in six months.

23:02.132 --> 23:06.053
It's nice to talk.
How are the Brooklyn Dodgers doing?

23:06.136 --> 23:10.057
- Moved to LA two years ago.
- No kidding?

23:12.726 --> 23:15.020
Warden don't allow books
in these cells.

23:15.103 --> 23:16.188
How come?

23:16.271 --> 23:18.815
Because there's no light in them.

23:20.609 --> 23:22.653
Better deliver them books, Morris,

23:22.778 --> 23:25.030
where they can be read.

23:25.113 --> 23:26.114
Right.

23:46.134 --> 23:47.553
What's the flower?

23:47.636 --> 23:49.888
That's something inside me

23:49.972 --> 23:53.433
they can't lock up
with their bars and walls.

23:55.727 --> 23:57.354
I'm Doc.

24:01.191 --> 24:03.652
You ever paint?

24:03.735 --> 24:06.280
- No.
- Why not?

24:10.450 --> 24:12.494
You scared of dying?

24:14.872 --> 24:18.041
- I don't think so.
- You better be.

24:18.125 --> 24:22.004
You hurt Wolf.
Wolf's going to hurt you.

24:35.142 --> 24:37.644
Where you going, cracker?

24:37.769 --> 24:38.937
Pete.

24:50.782 --> 24:53.660
Something special about those steps?

24:53.785 --> 24:57.080
The higher you sit,
the more status you got.

24:57.164 --> 24:59.958
So we play king of the mountain,

25:00.042 --> 25:03.295
except here we don't
play for fun, man.

25:03.378 --> 25:05.672
And you're king?

25:05.756 --> 25:07.508
Yeah.

25:12.763 --> 25:15.098
Now, I figure there's two reasons

25:15.224 --> 25:17.935
why you didn't sit down on my step.

25:19.061 --> 25:21.939
Either you're too scared,

25:22.064 --> 25:24.066
or you just hate niggers.

25:24.191 --> 25:28.403
Now, which is it, boy?
You too scared?

25:40.123 --> 25:42.125
I just hate niggers.

25:53.804 --> 25:56.098
So no one's ever busted out.

25:57.766 --> 25:59.685
No one's ever made it.

25:59.810 --> 26:03.689
Everyone has looked for a way,
but there ain't any.

26:05.148 --> 26:07.109
See those hacks?

26:07.192 --> 26:11.029
Most joints have one hack
for every seven cons.

26:11.154 --> 26:15.200
There's one hack
for every three cons here.

26:15.325 --> 26:18.829
You start shitting at night
instead of in the morning,

26:18.912 --> 26:21.290
they want to know why.

26:23.041 --> 26:26.086
Let's say you're
going to try it anyway.

26:26.211 --> 26:29.673
First, you've got
to get out of the cell.

26:29.756 --> 26:33.677
Each bar has six hard smaller bars

26:33.760 --> 26:37.598
set in a steel tube
with extra steel poured in.

26:37.723 --> 26:41.101
And there ain't no way
to tunnel out, either.

26:42.769 --> 26:44.104
Shit.

26:45.772 --> 26:48.150
This island is solid rock.

26:49.401 --> 26:51.695
See that water?

26:53.614 --> 26:58.035
It's over a mile swim to land.

26:58.118 --> 27:00.871
The currents make it seem like 10.

27:00.954 --> 27:05.709
And the water's so cold
it will numb your arms in minutes.

27:05.834 --> 27:11.131
Even if you are a good swimmer,
you won't have time to make it.

27:11.215 --> 27:17.054
There are 12 counts every day.

27:17.179 --> 27:21.642
Sometimes I think that's all
this shit hole is,

27:21.725 --> 27:24.686
one long count.

27:24.811 --> 27:26.647
We count the hours,

27:26.730 --> 27:28.649
the bulls count us,

27:28.732 --> 27:32.277
and the king bulls count the counts.

27:34.905 --> 27:37.741
Inside! Everybody in!

27:46.750 --> 27:49.294
I'm assigning you a permanent job.

27:50.754 --> 27:54.049
The carpentry shop.
It's a paying job.

27:54.132 --> 27:57.636
- How much?
- 15 cents an hour.

27:59.805 --> 28:02.724
Well, I always knew
crime would pay.

28:02.808 --> 28:05.769
It's a job.

28:10.440 --> 28:11.984
See you later.

28:16.780 --> 28:19.783
I sleep lousy,
but I sniff the glue.

28:19.867 --> 28:21.660
It passes the nights.

28:21.785 --> 28:24.705
Aren't you afraid
they'll shake down your cell?

28:24.830 --> 28:28.709
Then I go to the hole.
It's worth the chance.

28:30.460 --> 28:33.714
I guess anything you want bad enough
is worth the chance.

28:33.797 --> 28:36.800
Including busting out?

28:36.884 --> 28:38.886
Hey, maybe there's a way out.

28:39.011 --> 28:41.638
It's on top of your head.

28:41.722 --> 28:46.143
Yeah. The ventilator shafts
on top of our block.

28:46.226 --> 28:49.646
How do you get
on top of the block?

28:49.730 --> 28:52.774
- Ask the bull for the key.
- Thanks.

28:55.736 --> 28:58.113
Hey, jive dude, where you going?

29:01.283 --> 29:05.037
Summer's coming on.
It's getting cooler.

29:05.120 --> 29:09.625
Weather here is as crazy as The Rock.
Maybe crazier.

29:14.296 --> 29:18.008
Mark Twain wrote that
the coldest winter he ever spent

29:18.133 --> 29:20.802
was a summer in San Francisco.
I can...

29:24.348 --> 29:25.766
Wolf's coming at you.

29:25.849 --> 29:28.519
- Is his hand cupped?
- Yes.

29:28.602 --> 29:30.979
- Which one?
- His right.

29:50.040 --> 29:51.708
Break off!

29:52.793 --> 29:55.170
Drop it, Wolf!

30:00.175 --> 30:01.969
Drop it, Wolf.

30:15.232 --> 30:17.693
You like D-block, Wolf?

30:17.776 --> 30:22.114
You better, because you're gonna
rot there for a long time.

30:23.198 --> 30:24.658
D-block, Morris.

30:25.784 --> 30:27.661
Look, he came at me.

30:27.786 --> 30:29.413
I said D-block.

30:50.851 --> 30:53.061
When I get out, you're dead.

30:53.187 --> 30:55.731
You'll be dead before you get out.

32:07.719 --> 32:10.681
Warden don't like inmates fighting.

32:12.558 --> 32:15.769
Don't like 'em stinking up
their cells, either.

32:43.213 --> 32:44.923
Lights out!

33:19.166 --> 33:21.376
Go on back to your cell.

35:05.814 --> 35:07.983
Welcome to Alcatraz.

35:16.033 --> 35:19.703
- Hey, is anybody over there?
- Yeah, me.

35:19.786 --> 35:22.706
Come out in front and say hello.

35:22.789 --> 35:24.583
Busy.

35:24.666 --> 35:28.504
How busy can you be
in one of these closets?

35:37.638 --> 35:39.681
Don't worry. I washed it.

35:41.433 --> 35:44.520
How you doing, neighbour?
I'm Charley Butts.

35:47.814 --> 35:49.691
Smallest cell I ever been in.

35:49.775 --> 35:53.278
- You'll get used to it.
- I don't think so.

35:53.362 --> 35:56.114
I don't like living alone here.

35:56.198 --> 35:58.408
You'll get used to that, too.

36:00.202 --> 36:01.537
Break out!

36:09.044 --> 36:10.879
Yard time!

36:18.220 --> 36:20.180
Button the collar.

36:23.225 --> 36:24.893
Who's the new fish?

36:24.977 --> 36:27.437
I got him next to me.

36:27.521 --> 36:30.107
- What's your name?
- Charley Butts.

36:30.190 --> 36:31.692
Charley's butt?

36:31.775 --> 36:34.736
Butts. Butts. Charley Butts.

36:34.820 --> 36:36.989
You got a funny name, kid.

36:37.072 --> 36:38.699
Yeah? What's your name?

36:38.782 --> 36:40.409
Al Capone.

36:41.618 --> 36:43.495
Thought you were dead.

36:43.579 --> 36:47.541
Me? I got too much money.
I'll never die.

36:47.624 --> 36:50.711
- You play poker?
- Not much.

36:50.794 --> 36:54.131
I just learned myself.
We'll play tomorrow.

36:54.214 --> 36:56.133
See you later, kid.

36:56.216 --> 36:58.093
See you later, Al.

36:58.177 --> 37:01.138
I don't believe
I just met Al Capone.

37:01.221 --> 37:02.723
I don't, either.

37:02.806 --> 37:05.434
- I'm Doc.
- Charley Butts.

37:05.517 --> 37:07.561
How's the painting going, Doc?

37:07.644 --> 37:11.732
The one of the warden?
It's nearly finished.

37:11.815 --> 37:15.652
- You painting the warden?
- He's very inspiring.

38:26.223 --> 38:28.559
Inside. Everybody in.

38:35.107 --> 38:36.191
Yes, sir?

38:36.275 --> 38:41.697
I want painting privileges
taken away from Chester Dalton.

38:41.780 --> 38:45.159
- Doc?
- Cell 233.

38:45.242 --> 38:46.743
What's the reason?

38:46.827 --> 38:49.705
You're deputy warden.
You think of one.

38:49.788 --> 38:52.791
When do you want
the suspension to begin?

38:52.916 --> 38:55.961
It's not a suspension.
It's an elimination.

38:58.672 --> 39:02.092
- Right away.
- Yes, sir.

39:07.264 --> 39:10.142
Painting privileges
have been removed.

39:19.818 --> 39:21.737
Why?

39:21.820 --> 39:23.489
I don't know.

39:42.591 --> 39:44.718
Painting's all I have.

39:47.095 --> 39:48.555
I'm sorry, Doc.

40:20.212 --> 40:22.089
You OK, Doc?

40:22.172 --> 40:24.800
I think there's
something wrong with him.

41:08.051 --> 41:12.181
I'd keep my eye on Doc.
He seems pretty upset.

41:12.264 --> 41:14.933
Cons are always upset
about something.

41:15.058 --> 41:16.685
Put your overalls on.

41:20.272 --> 41:23.734
Mr Zimmerman,
I'm making a new table.

41:23.817 --> 41:25.652
I need a hatchet.

41:30.199 --> 41:33.202
Bob, get Doc a hatchet.

41:59.228 --> 42:01.146
Mr Zimmerman!

42:01.230 --> 42:04.191
Can you come over here
for a minute?

42:31.802 --> 42:34.805
Get him out of here! Get him out!

42:37.140 --> 42:40.394
Take him out of here! Get him out!

42:44.815 --> 42:46.400
Get back to work.

42:51.655 --> 42:53.240
Let's go! Move!

42:55.033 --> 42:58.245
Everybody, back to work! Let's go!

43:57.513 --> 44:00.516
Here. Put that in your report.

44:59.241 --> 45:01.994
What were you doing
back there, boy?

45:03.829 --> 45:07.124
- How about a magazine?
- Why not?

45:07.207 --> 45:10.752
What do you want? Boy's Life?

45:10.878 --> 45:15.215
I know some queens
who fight over it every month.

45:15.299 --> 45:18.218
Just give me what
you got on top there.

45:25.225 --> 45:27.728
I heard about Doc,

45:27.853 --> 45:31.023
and I know why he did it.

45:35.235 --> 45:38.280
Somebody took away
his painting privileges.

45:38.405 --> 45:39.907
Who?

45:42.784 --> 45:44.786
The warden.

45:57.132 --> 45:58.967
Morris.

46:06.266 --> 46:09.353
I hear there was an accident
in one of the shops.

46:09.436 --> 46:12.189
Accident? You mean Doc.

46:12.272 --> 46:15.359
Yeah, someone didn't like
what he was painting,

46:15.484 --> 46:17.778
so someone won't let him paint.

46:17.861 --> 46:22.074
Someone should have warned Doc
to be careful what he paints.

46:22.199 --> 46:24.743
I think you're absolutely right, sir.

46:24.868 --> 46:26.870
There's always the possibility

46:26.995 --> 46:30.207
that some asshole will be offended,
isn't there?

46:30.290 --> 46:32.417
We all have to be careful.

46:33.544 --> 46:35.170
Back in line.

46:49.268 --> 46:51.270
Hey, how's it going, Frank?

46:53.272 --> 46:55.482
Well, well.
If it isn't the Anglins.

46:55.607 --> 46:57.776
What are you guys doing,
just dropping by?

46:57.860 --> 47:01.905
- Thought we'd pay you a visit.
- Gonna stay long?

47:01.989 --> 47:05.159
Not long. Only about 15 or 20 years.

47:05.242 --> 47:06.785
Why The Rock?

47:06.869 --> 47:10.914
We were leaving Atlanta when
we encountered a minor problem.

47:10.998 --> 47:13.500
- Such as?
- They saw us.

47:13.584 --> 47:15.794
Yeah, that do present problems.

47:15.878 --> 47:17.754
They shipped us to Leavenworth.

47:17.838 --> 47:20.507
But we didn't like
their accommodations, either.

47:20.591 --> 47:24.845
Warden said he knew
just the place for us... Alcatraz.

47:24.928 --> 47:29.725
Is it true no one's
ever bust out of here?

47:29.850 --> 47:32.603
- So they tell me.
- Jesus.

47:34.146 --> 47:36.732
Wonder what I'd be like
after 15 years here.

48:42.881 --> 48:44.883
You still reading that bible?

48:45.008 --> 48:48.846
Yeah. It's opening up
all kinds of new doors.

49:05.237 --> 49:08.824
I turned 35 today. Some birthday.

49:10.242 --> 49:14.163
- When's your birthday?
- I don't know.

49:14.288 --> 49:17.124
Jeez, what kind of
childhood did you have?

49:17.249 --> 49:19.126
Short.

49:23.213 --> 49:27.801
I always wanted to see San Francisco.
Never thought it'd be like this.

49:27.885 --> 49:30.804
What'd you get sent to the rock for?

49:32.181 --> 49:35.684
Couple of years ago I started
stealing cars, for kicks mostly.

49:35.767 --> 49:40.898
I'd sell the parts.
Got sent to the state pen.

49:40.981 --> 49:43.192
You end up in Alcatraz for that?

49:43.275 --> 49:46.153
Not exactly. A bull there
liked to push me around.

49:46.236 --> 49:50.782
So when I got out,
I went back, and stole his car.

49:50.866 --> 49:54.077
Unfortunately,
I drove it across the state line,

49:54.161 --> 49:59.208
which made it a federal rap,
and I was sent to the rock.

50:01.793 --> 50:05.214
English! Visitor for you.

50:08.300 --> 50:11.678
Butts, you got a visitor.

50:11.762 --> 50:14.056
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

50:14.139 --> 50:16.808
Probably somebody
wants their car back.

50:39.706 --> 50:41.083
Hello, father.

50:47.130 --> 50:49.049
Why didn't you say you were coming?

50:49.132 --> 50:52.594
I was afraid you wouldn't let me.

50:54.346 --> 50:56.723
It's just hard to see you like this.

51:01.895 --> 51:03.939
Your mama's going to die.

51:14.283 --> 51:15.826
Charley?

51:18.954 --> 51:20.414
When?

51:20.497 --> 51:24.626
Well, she's got a few months.

51:25.836 --> 51:27.671
Can you call her?

51:29.798 --> 51:31.842
We're not allowed
to make phone calls.

51:31.925 --> 51:36.096
You cannot discuss institution rules.
Stick to your personal life.

51:36.180 --> 51:40.267
This is my personal life!
You getting a kick out of it?

51:41.059 --> 51:42.186
Hello?

51:43.437 --> 51:44.855
Hello!

51:47.900 --> 51:54.323
I... love... you... Charley.

52:20.265 --> 52:21.683
Hey, Frank.

52:23.685 --> 52:25.103
Yeah?

52:25.187 --> 52:28.482
If you try to get out, I want in.

52:45.666 --> 52:49.211
- Must be Wednesday.
- Why?

52:49.294 --> 52:51.213
Mystery mounds.

52:51.296 --> 52:54.049
We always have
mystery mounds on Wednesday.

52:54.132 --> 52:57.845
I can't taste it.
I just eat it out of habit.

53:02.224 --> 53:07.062
- What's the movie this weekend?
- Some cowboy piece of shit.

53:07.146 --> 53:11.650
Hey, at least they could
show us a gangster movie.

53:15.737 --> 53:17.739
I may have found a way out of here.

53:24.454 --> 53:26.331
You looking at something?

53:33.130 --> 53:36.508
This cell block's really getting old.

53:36.633 --> 53:42.222
The moist air corrodes the concrete.
The salt is rusting the metal.

53:42.306 --> 53:46.810
I took a nail clipper, and dug around
the grille at the back of the cell.

53:46.894 --> 53:49.188
I can dig that grille out,

53:49.271 --> 53:52.399
and enlarge the hole
into the utility corridor

53:52.483 --> 53:57.321
to the top of the cell block
and maybe onto the roof.

53:57.404 --> 53:59.907
How will we hide the hole?

54:01.033 --> 54:05.120
We tear the ads from magazines...
no one will miss those...

54:05.204 --> 54:10.167
make cardboard, paint grilles
on that, and put it in the hole,

54:10.250 --> 54:13.754
maybe partially obscure it
with a towel or whatever.

54:13.879 --> 54:18.133
I've ordered an accordion
to put in front of my hole.

54:18.217 --> 54:22.763
Suppose we make it. They'll know
we're gone at the next count.

54:22.846 --> 54:27.184
We'll leave at night,
so they won't know till the morning.

54:27.267 --> 54:30.145
We'll have to make some dummy heads,

54:30.270 --> 54:33.732
make them out of plaster
or cardboard or whatever.

54:33.816 --> 54:37.319
Put them in the bunks,
the guards won't know.

54:37.444 --> 54:40.781
You work in the barbershop.
You get the hair.

54:40.864 --> 54:43.242
How do we cross the bay?

54:43.325 --> 54:47.454
That's your job.
You work in the clothing shop.

54:47.538 --> 54:51.750
You're gonna steal some raincoats
and some contact cement.

54:51.834 --> 54:54.753
We'll make a life raft
and some life preservers.

54:54.837 --> 54:57.047
I read how to do it
in Popular Mechanics.

54:57.172 --> 54:59.174
They'll think we're going to Frisco.

54:59.258 --> 55:03.011
Well, we won't.
We'll go to Angel Island instead.

55:06.014 --> 55:08.225
What about me?

55:08.350 --> 55:12.813
You'll stand guard while I dig.
I'll stand guard while you dig.

55:12.896 --> 55:15.607
You two trade off the same way.

55:20.112 --> 55:21.947
What are our chances?

55:22.072 --> 55:24.283
Slim.

55:25.534 --> 55:27.870
- I'm in.
- Me, too.

55:27.953 --> 55:29.413
I wanna go.

55:39.590 --> 55:41.133
Charley.

55:42.259 --> 55:43.427
Yeah?

55:43.510 --> 55:46.805
I'm gonna start digging.
Keep an eye out.

55:46.930 --> 55:49.975
If you see one,
start whistling, huh?

56:48.283 --> 56:50.202
How's it going?

56:50.285 --> 56:51.703
Fair.

56:58.627 --> 57:01.713
Whoever named this place
The Rock wasn't kidding.

57:01.797 --> 57:05.884
Working with those nail clippers
just doesn't have any grip.

57:24.027 --> 57:25.487
Hey, guard.

57:30.200 --> 57:31.285
Yeah?

57:31.368 --> 57:35.455
Can I exchange this spoon? Looks
like it's been in someone's ass.

57:35.539 --> 57:38.625
And I want to work in the kitchen.

57:41.587 --> 57:44.089
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

57:53.098 --> 57:55.809
I'd like to join the kitchen detail.

57:55.934 --> 57:57.019
Can you cook?

57:57.102 --> 57:59.480
Can I swap this spoon for another?

57:59.605 --> 58:01.523
Damn right I can cook.

58:01.607 --> 58:07.070
I used to be a cook in this cafe.
Everybody loved my meatballs.

58:07.154 --> 58:09.281
Did you quit or get fired?

58:09.364 --> 58:11.992
Neither. I robbed the cafe.

58:27.508 --> 58:30.969
- Heard you had a visitor.
- My daughter.

58:31.053 --> 58:33.430
She's getting married.

58:33.514 --> 58:35.599
He's white...

58:35.724 --> 58:37.810
just like you.

58:37.893 --> 58:39.728
Congratulations.

58:41.146 --> 58:45.567
- Want a magazine?
- Yeah. What do you recommend?

58:47.903 --> 58:49.321
Ebony.

58:55.035 --> 58:56.829
Hey, English.

58:58.705 --> 59:03.126
Is it possible to weld two pieces
of metal together here in the cell?

59:05.087 --> 59:07.840
For digging... or sticking?

59:08.799 --> 59:10.467
Digging.

59:11.301 --> 59:15.097
It ain't easy, but I could show you.

59:15.180 --> 59:17.641
Planning on going somewhere?

59:21.478 --> 59:25.357
There hasn't been a day
that I've been on this rock

59:25.482 --> 59:27.776
that I didn't think of busting out.

59:27.860 --> 59:33.323
If I'd known, I'd have slashed
my throat instead of my tendon.

59:40.539 --> 59:43.458
Hey, Litmus, can you get me a dime?

59:43.542 --> 59:46.378
No problem. Cost you 10 desserts.

59:46.461 --> 59:48.088
I need it tonight.

59:48.213 --> 59:50.674
No problem. Cost you an extra five.

59:50.757 --> 59:55.721
Get me a dime, I'll toss in
10 beetles for your mouse.

01:00:44.812 --> 01:00:46.021
Thanks.

01:02:35.088 --> 01:02:37.466
Hey, Frank, what's burning?

01:02:39.635 --> 01:02:43.805
If you see one of those bulls
coming, just start whistling.

01:03:49.204 --> 01:03:51.748
Hey, Spoof, what's for breakfast?

01:04:24.948 --> 01:04:26.742
I smell something burning.

01:04:27.910 --> 01:04:29.828
I don't smell anything.

01:04:31.079 --> 01:04:32.915
Hell, must be my imagination.

01:04:32.998 --> 01:04:36.168
Working nights
really gets to you after a while.

01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:40.714
Try it from my side.

01:04:58.899 --> 01:05:01.985
Keep an eye out. He may be back.

01:05:50.534 --> 01:05:53.537
The grille's welded
on two-hook anchors?

01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:58.876
If I get a wedge I may be able
to knock those anchors loose.

01:06:12.222 --> 01:06:15.350
This might just be
what I'm looking for.

01:06:15.434 --> 01:06:18.979
But it won't get through
the metal detector.

01:06:19.062 --> 01:06:20.856
Yeah, I know.

01:06:28.071 --> 01:06:29.364
Morris, hold it.

01:06:29.448 --> 01:06:32.159
I made it for a clothes-peg.

01:06:32.242 --> 01:06:34.203
Why the metal over the edge?

01:06:34.286 --> 01:06:36.955
So the clothes would slide off easy.

01:06:37.039 --> 01:06:39.166
I don't believe you.

01:06:39.249 --> 01:06:43.587
I didn't try to hide it. Why would I
try to take metal through a detector?

01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:46.965
Because you're stupid.

01:06:48.467 --> 01:06:49.635
Move it.

01:10:34.485 --> 01:10:36.278
Open up 107.

01:10:40.491 --> 01:10:44.244
Why did you order this stuff?
You don't look like a painter.

01:10:44.369 --> 01:10:47.956
You wouldn't know talent
if it looked you in the face.

01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:52.211
I'm looking you in the face
and I don't see shit.

01:11:04.890 --> 01:11:06.433
Hair. Your colour.

01:11:08.727 --> 01:11:10.103
Frank.

01:11:12.272 --> 01:11:15.776
Paint. One of them's flesh-coloured.

01:11:15.859 --> 01:11:17.778
What are you painting?

01:11:17.861 --> 01:11:20.781
I don't know. The ocean maybe.

01:11:20.864 --> 01:11:25.118
If you're using flesh-coloured paint,
you better paint a portrait.

01:11:26.286 --> 01:11:27.454
Yeah.

01:15:41.792 --> 01:15:42.960
Frank.

01:15:45.629 --> 01:15:46.964
Frank.

01:15:59.643 --> 01:16:02.312
Morris go to sleep early tonight?

01:16:02.437 --> 01:16:04.815
Yeah. Wasn't feeling well.

01:16:04.898 --> 01:16:08.861
He must sleep pretty soundly.
He hasn't moved.

01:16:36.305 --> 01:16:37.556
Morris?

01:16:38.724 --> 01:16:40.559
Yeah, what's up?

01:16:45.731 --> 01:16:48.358
I went up top last night.

01:16:48.442 --> 01:16:52.613
I saw the ventilator shaft
to the roof, but I can't reach it.

01:16:52.696 --> 01:16:54.490
I need a boost.

01:16:56.283 --> 01:16:58.452
How are you all coming?

01:16:58.577 --> 01:17:00.204
My dummy's ready.

01:17:00.287 --> 01:17:04.374
The hole's done,
but I'm just starting the dummy.

01:17:04.458 --> 01:17:06.460
I ain't doing too good.

01:17:08.921 --> 01:17:11.840
Tonight, John and I will go up.

01:17:18.013 --> 01:17:22.518
You get those raincoats,
might as well start hauling them up.

01:17:22.643 --> 01:17:25.395
I'll wear one back
from the shop each day.

01:17:25.521 --> 01:17:28.607
There's a different hack
there in the afternoon.

01:17:28.690 --> 01:17:30.943
He'll think I wore it to work.

01:17:31.026 --> 01:17:35.572
- Can you get that contact cement?
- I keep inventory.

01:18:31.795 --> 01:18:33.672
Hey!

01:18:40.387 --> 01:18:42.181
Give me a boost.

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:50.856
The bars feel pretty solid.

01:18:52.357 --> 01:18:56.612
There seems to be a metal hood
riveted onto higher uprights.

01:18:56.695 --> 01:19:01.033
We'll spread the bars
with a pipe and knock the hood off.

01:19:03.494 --> 01:19:05.412
There's an electrical outlet here.

01:19:05.496 --> 01:19:10.459
Get a motor, a drill bit and
a flashlight and we'd have it all.

01:19:10.584 --> 01:19:13.045
Great.
Where's the nearest hardware store?

01:19:32.898 --> 01:19:37.444
Can you get me an extension cord
and a drill bit from the shop?

01:19:37.528 --> 01:19:40.948
If they find out, I go to the hole.

01:19:41.031 --> 01:19:46.370
All right, but from now on,
you put your desserts onto my tray.

01:19:48.872 --> 01:19:51.959
Time's up. Back to the cells.

01:19:52.042 --> 01:19:55.963
Damn it! Just when
I thought we was doing good.

01:20:02.261 --> 01:20:03.720
I can use this.

01:20:04.805 --> 01:20:06.515
Are you crazy?

01:20:33.917 --> 01:20:35.794
Hold it, Morris.

01:20:37.546 --> 01:20:39.506
Want to look at one of those cases.

01:20:46.096 --> 01:20:47.639
Try this one.

01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:54.646
Let's open it up.

01:21:07.659 --> 01:21:10.746
Stole this penlight from the Doc.

01:22:54.975 --> 01:22:56.351
Hey.

01:22:59.605 --> 01:23:01.023
Give me a boost.

01:23:14.703 --> 01:23:16.121
Pipe.

01:23:58.831 --> 01:24:02.668
OK. Hand me the drill.

01:24:58.891 --> 01:25:01.185
We're all through.

01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:18.535
Fire!

01:25:18.619 --> 01:25:22.331
Hey, 50-millimetre guns.

01:25:24.500 --> 01:25:27.002
I'm worried about the shakedowns.

01:25:27.085 --> 01:25:29.588
My cardboard grille
keeps slipping out.

01:25:29.671 --> 01:25:32.174
Put some contact cement
around the edges.

01:25:32.257 --> 01:25:34.635
That should take care of it.

01:25:40.599 --> 01:25:43.894
How's the raft
and the life jackets coming?

01:25:43.977 --> 01:25:46.021
OK.

01:25:46.104 --> 01:25:48.398
I think they'll be done Tuesday.

01:25:50.484 --> 01:25:52.528
Tuesday night, we go.

01:26:12.506 --> 01:26:14.633
What's that for?

01:26:14.716 --> 01:26:17.010
Just thinking about Doc.

01:26:17.094 --> 01:26:21.390
Yeah. We planted
those chrysanthemums 15 years ago.

01:26:21.515 --> 01:26:24.977
They meant a lot to Doc. To me, too.

01:26:25.060 --> 01:26:28.772
- I had a garden.
- What'd you grow, weeds?

01:26:28.897 --> 01:26:32.401
It's against regulations,
Morris, and you know it.

01:26:46.248 --> 01:26:47.666
Stretcher.

01:26:48.792 --> 01:26:50.586
Get the medic.

01:26:50.669 --> 01:26:52.254
He won't need one.

01:27:04.516 --> 01:27:07.519
Some men are destined
never to leave Alcatraz...

01:27:10.898 --> 01:27:12.399
alive.

01:27:28.207 --> 01:27:30.209
Got those books that may help you.

01:27:30.334 --> 01:27:31.752
Thanks.

01:27:33.295 --> 01:27:34.755
See you later, man.

01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:37.591
Goodbye... boy.

01:27:56.443 --> 01:27:59.613
So long... boy.

01:28:15.671 --> 01:28:16.672
Shakedown.

01:28:22.344 --> 01:28:23.470
Move.

01:28:23.554 --> 01:28:25.848
Move, move, move.

01:28:38.235 --> 01:28:39.903
Take a seat.

01:29:22.321 --> 01:29:26.325
- Been playing this thing long?
- Couple of months.

01:29:28.660 --> 01:29:31.830
- You any good?
- Terrible.

01:29:34.625 --> 01:29:36.877
You'll get better.

01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:47.721
Excuse me.

01:29:56.522 --> 01:30:00.234
That's one of the benefits
of Alcatraz.

01:30:00.359 --> 01:30:02.653
Lots of time to practise.

01:30:06.698 --> 01:30:10.452
Has Morris
been doing anything unusual?

01:30:10.536 --> 01:30:13.789
Sometimes he stays up late
talking with Butts.

01:30:13.914 --> 01:30:16.208
Split them up. Move Morris.

01:30:16.291 --> 01:30:20.379
I'll have to get a cell ready
and do the paperwork.

01:30:20.462 --> 01:30:22.714
- Do you?
- Yes, sir.

01:30:22.798 --> 01:30:26.009
We could move him, say, Wednesday.

01:30:26.135 --> 01:30:28.971
- Tuesday morning.
- Yes, sir.

01:30:42.526 --> 01:30:44.361
I missed you, Morris.

01:30:44.486 --> 01:30:49.074
I missed you so much,
I got a present for you.

01:30:49.199 --> 01:30:51.869
I'll give it to you... later.

01:30:53.036 --> 01:30:55.122
Get your ass back there.

01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:06.800
He'll kill you,
or you'll have to kill him.

01:31:06.925 --> 01:31:10.429
Well, I'm not going
to give him the chance.

01:31:10.512 --> 01:31:14.892
Can you get the raft
and life jackets ready by tonight?

01:31:16.101 --> 01:31:17.436
All right.

01:31:17.561 --> 01:31:22.107
We'll meet on top
as soon as the lights are out.

01:31:38.415 --> 01:31:42.002
- Wolf, you carrying?
- Who, me?

01:31:46.507 --> 01:31:48.008
Move out.

01:32:28.882 --> 01:32:30.634
Where you going, Wolfie?

01:32:30.717 --> 01:32:33.637
I'm just going for a walk.

01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:35.806
Let's take that walk.

01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:46.191
After six months in the hole,

01:32:46.316 --> 01:32:50.779
looks like you could
use some exercise.

01:32:55.742 --> 01:32:57.369
Butts.

01:32:58.328 --> 01:33:00.664
I'll meet you up on top.

01:33:04.293 --> 01:33:05.878
Let's go.

01:33:19.433 --> 01:33:22.936
Yeah. You're going, too.

01:34:50.482 --> 01:34:52.025
Butts.

01:34:56.738 --> 01:34:58.490
Butts, God damn it.

01:41:03.272 --> 01:41:06.525
Can't risk tearing this gear,
what's left of it.

01:41:06.608 --> 01:41:09.403
Throw me the stuff when I get over.

01:41:54.114 --> 01:41:55.949
Watch the barbed wire.

01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:56.315
Get up, Morris. It's moving day.

01:45:58.233 --> 01:46:01.278
I said, get up, Morris. Open up 109.

01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:06.033
God damn it, Morris. I said get...

01:46:08.452 --> 01:46:10.037
Jesus Christ.

01:46:49.034 --> 01:46:51.453
Morning, Sergeant. What have you got?

01:46:51.537 --> 01:46:54.206
Photos and a notebook
of Clarence Anglin's.

01:46:54.289 --> 01:46:55.624
Funny looking bag.

01:46:55.749 --> 01:46:58.752
Must have been made from a raincoat.

01:46:59.628 --> 01:47:02.172
- It appears that they drowned.
- Why?

01:47:02.297 --> 01:47:06.135
If that was important
they wouldn't have lost it.

01:47:06.260 --> 01:47:10.097
Maybe they lost it
to look like they drowned.

01:47:51.096 --> 01:47:55.434
Warden, I just got a message
from the Director.

01:47:55.517 --> 01:47:57.853
He wants you in Washington.

01:47:57.936 --> 01:48:00.272
Do chrysanthemums grow
on this island?

01:48:00.397 --> 01:48:02.816
Not here on Angel Island. Why?

01:48:02.941 --> 01:48:04.943
I'm curious.

01:48:05.903 --> 01:48:10.991
The tides were mild
and the fog light last night.

01:48:12.367 --> 01:48:17.581
If they left at lights out,
they had a 91/2-hour head start.

01:48:17.664 --> 01:48:20.000
I wonder if they made it.

01:48:20.125 --> 01:48:22.252
They drowned.

01:48:23.670 --> 01:48:25.172
Yes, sir.

01:49:08.048 --> 01:49:12.136
