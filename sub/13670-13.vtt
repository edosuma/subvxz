00:07.160 --> 00:08.640
Two of you step forward.

00:08.640 --> 00:10.760
    I won't listen to lectures.

00:10.760 --> 00:12.440
Still can't remember your name.

00:12.440 --> 00:14.600
I need to know. I need to know
who I am.

00:14.600 --> 00:16.239
You're a doctor.

00:16.239 --> 00:19.000
Yes. Doctor Jonas Wizner, MD.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
Mary Richards.
I'm Mary Richards, hi.

00:23.840 --> 00:27.560
A man. Upset because
we're performing abortions.

00:27.560 --> 00:31.560
There's a bomb in the hospital.

01:59.040 --> 02:03.040

We'll be camped here for three days
while you diddle away your day off.

02:31.280 --> 02:33.240
Westphall wants to see me.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.360
            What's up?

02:35.360 --> 02:38.160
Getting my community assignment.
Can't wait.

02:38.160 --> 02:39.600
Victor.

02:39.600 --> 02:42.320
You're doing the DNC on
             Terry Valerie tomorrow.

02:42.320 --> 02:43.640
               Yeah.

02:43.640 --> 02:47.240
I haven't talked to her and Ken
about the miscarriage. Take it easy.

02:47.240 --> 02:47.920
              Bingo.

02:47.920 --> 02:49.040
              Bingo.
Good.

02:49.040 --> 02:51.560
Now we have to sit through a stupid
lecture.

02:51.560 --> 02:53.960
You and Westphall haven't been
sorority sisters since

02:53.960 --> 02:55.320
        you yelled at him.

02:55.320 --> 02:58.200
I got sick of hearing him tear into
us about not being committed.

02:58.200 --> 02:59.920
I got sick of hearing him tear into
us about not being committed.
Never take on one
of the head cheeses.

02:59.920 --> 03:03.920

03:17.280 --> 03:20.760
Went to some a funeral and freaked
out. Personally, I'm thrilled.

03:20.760 --> 03:24.000
What should I do when I see
Westphall?

03:24.000 --> 03:26.240
Sorry. You've got two possibilities.

03:26.240 --> 03:30.240
One - call him sir. Stare at
the rug and eat crow.

03:31.480 --> 03:35.240
Or scream like a banshee and get
dropped from the residency programme.

03:35.240 --> 03:38.800
I've got enough problems. Planning
a marriage, having to buy a ring.

03:38.800 --> 03:41.560
Tell me about it.
Connubial bliss is a living hell.

03:41.560 --> 03:45.560
I'd rather stroll into

03:54.040 --> 03:56.120
    act like you're interested.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.320
       John Dow number six.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.760
That's the nut that impersonated
Dr Wizner.

04:14.760 --> 04:17.200
Likeable fellow. Mixed up, though.

04:17.200 --> 04:20.120
I'm trying to help him remember
his true identity.

04:20.120 --> 04:22.720
All must, as chimney sweepers, come
to dust.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.440
Do you want me to call security?

04:24.440 --> 04:25.840
No, I'll handle this.

04:25.840 --> 04:29.280
Oh, Yorick. &gt;

04:29.280 --> 04:31.000
We must make Plymouth

We must make Plymouth

05:12.800 --> 05:14.120
Yeah. Somewhere else.

05:15.400 --> 05:19.400

05:32.200 --> 05:33.920
       Doctor. How's Terry?

05:33.920 --> 05:36.960
They're bringing her out of
post-op now.

05:36.960 --> 05:40.960
That's a great way to start a day.

05:41.320 --> 05:42.520
           Here we are.

05:42.520 --> 05:43.760
Are you all right?

05:43.760 --> 05:45.440
Compared to what?

05:45.440 --> 05:46.640
She's gonna be fine.

05:46.640 --> 05:49.080
I'm tired of hearing that from you
people.

05:49.080 --> 05:51.360
It's not the hospital's fault.

05:51.360 --> 05:54.960
I've had enough. Doctor Turner tried
to sucker us into having a kid,

05:54.960 --> 05:56.080
         then she splits.

05:56.080 --> 05:58.240
Next, it's Chandler's turn and now
you.

05:58.240 --> 06:00.680
Our plumber jacks us around but we
expect that.

06:00.680 --> 06:02.480
No-one gave you any guarantees.

06:02.480 --> 06:04.560
      You call the dance and
we do the steps.

06:04.560 --> 06:08.560
Artificial insemination, in vitro
fertilisation, embryo harvesting.

06:08.920 --> 06:11.520
Zoos have had better luck breeding
pandas.

06:11.520 --> 06:14.120
There's gotta be something we can
do.

06:14.120 --> 06:16.240
Surrogate mothering, for instance.

06:16.240 --> 06:17.440
It's expensive.

06:17.440 --> 06:20.800
You still have to harvest and
fertilise Terry's eggs into

06:20.800 --> 06:24.800
another woman - you'd be making the
muffin in someone else's oven.

06:24.880 --> 06:28.480
Thanks. I prefer my own kitchen.

06:28.480 --> 06:31.880
OK. There's always adoption.

06:31.880 --> 06:33.200
I was adopted.

06:33.200 --> 06:35.400
You're a leg up. I'll arrange for
you to meet with

06:35.400 --> 06:39.400
an adoption counsellor. What have
you got to lose?

Hello.
Hi.

             Sit down.

06:51.360 --> 06:52.480
Yes, sir.

06:52.480 --> 06:55.400
Mrs Attucks is here to set you up in
your community service.

06:55.400 --> 06:56.640
Mrs Attucks is here to set you up in
your community service.
Doing what?

06:56.640 --> 06:58.960
I'm in charge of geriatric home
health care.

06:58.960 --> 07:02.960
We provide doctors who make house
calls to elderly shut-ins.

07:03.880 --> 07:05.000
You're kidding.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.440
Is there a problem?

07:06.440 --> 07:09.200
       No. Please continue.

07:09.200 --> 07:11.560
Our patients need follow-up exams,

07:11.560 --> 07:13.680
medical maintenance, post-op care.

07:13.680 --> 07:16.520
They also need company from time to
time.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.440
Excuse me, but I'm an ER doctor.

07:18.440 --> 07:21.640
        Go on, Mrs Attucks.

07:21.640 --> 07:23.200
Elderly patients...

07:23.200 --> 07:26.640
If I have to do community service,
I'd rather work with more action.

07:26.640 --> 07:30.480
That's why I've assigned you to home
health care.

07:30.480 --> 07:34.160
You need to see another side of
medicine.

07:34.160 --> 07:36.880
I've never really cared for
gerontology.

07:36.880 --> 07:40.640
I was under the impression your
residents were enthusiastic.

07:40.640 --> 07:43.280
 Some of them have needed a push.

07:43.280 --> 07:47.280
  This isn't open to discussion.

07:47.880 --> 07:48.960
Sir.

07:48.960 --> 07:52.640
Working with older people
presents quite a challenge. &gt;

07:52.640 --> 07:54.720
They can wear you down. &gt;

07:54.720 --> 07:58.720
Disease and illness hit their age
group especially hard. &gt;

08:10.240 --> 08:11.640
     John. How are you doing?

08:11.640 --> 08:13.000
Excellent!

08:13.000 --> 08:14.560
Well.

08:14.560 --> 08:16.320

the boring king plays.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.039
I'm finished.

08:36.039 --> 08:39.240
Tomorrow, tomorrow and tomorrow.

08:39.240 --> 08:42.080
I said to myself I'd rewrite.

08:42.080 --> 08:45.280
I've left just 37 plays and 154
sonnets.

08:45.280 --> 08:49.280
By me. Not by Bacon or Marlow.
The quill hand gets tired.

08:49.800 --> 08:53.800
Has your pretending to be the bard
had anything to do with our talk?

08:54.000 --> 08:57.120
I told you that the man and woman who
may me able to identify you

08:57.120 --> 08:59.520

08:59.520 --> 09:00.600

09:00.600 --> 09:02.160
   They could be your relatives.

09:02.160 --> 09:04.120
Well a day.

09:04.120 --> 09:07.320
Then I'll sweat and seek about
for eases

09:07.320 --> 09:10.000
and at that time bequeath you my
diseases.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
Pare thy nails dead.

09:17.920 --> 09:18.800
Where are you heading?
               Doom.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.880
Yeah. I heard you got engaged.

09:20.880 --> 09:23.960
You know what community service
Westphall stuck me with?

09:23.960 --> 09:25.520
    House calls to old people.

09:25.520 --> 09:26.360
What's wrong with that?

09:26.360 --> 09:30.360
What's wrong with that?
Nothing. If you enjoy watching
paint dry.

09:31.080 --> 09:33.360
Excuse me. Have you got the time?

09:33.360 --> 09:34.840
It's 9.05.

09:34.840 --> 09:38.840
Thanks.

09:41.640 --> 09:45.640
       Oh, for Pete's sake!

09:59.600 --> 09:59.920
Hi.

09:59.920 --> 10:01.320
Hi.
    How did the deposition go?

10:01.320 --> 10:05.320
I felt like I was on trial for
kidnapping the Lindbergh baby.

10:05.960 --> 10:08.400
Lucy's lawyer was the most
obnoxious...

10:08.400 --> 10:10.800
You should have heard the way he
treated me.

10:10.800 --> 10:13.960
"What went through your mind when
you beat Nurse Papandreou?

10:13.960 --> 10:16.600
"Did hitting her give you pleasure?"
Ugh!

10:16.600 --> 10:19.280
   What does your lawyer think?

10:19.280 --> 10:23.280
He advised me to settle, then gave
me his bill. I can't afford this!

10:25.280 --> 10:27.400
I  guess you shouldn't have hit her.

10:27.400 --> 10:29.240
What's wrong with me?

10:29.240 --> 10:32.480
I never hit anybody.
  Now, I'm slugging everybody.

10:32.480 --> 10:34.480
Including my son.

10:34.480 --> 10:36.240
      Amazing kids is tough.

10:36.240 --> 10:39.200
Yeah. And making them was so easy.

10:39.200 --> 10:40.240
               Yeah.

Doctor Fiscus.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.400
     I've never heard of you.

10:54.400 --> 10:58.400
I'm with the Home Health Agency.

10:59.960 --> 11:02.040
     Doctors carry black bags.

11:02.040 --> 11:03.320
I'm an iconoclast.

11:03.320 --> 11:07.120
    I don't need a specialist.

11:07.120 --> 11:10.680
Wait. Miss Pavlon. Last time someone
was here to see you there was

11:10.680 --> 11:14.240
some problems with your blood
pressure.

11:14.240 --> 11:15.080
                So?

11:15.080 --> 11:17.400
                So?
I should examine you.

11:17.400 --> 11:21.400
I wish I didn't have to be here,
either.

11:29.960 --> 11:33.960
          Wipe your feet.

11:40.360 --> 11:44.360
    We got the mortgage in '49.

11:44.560 --> 11:47.000
 I haven't traipsed upstairs since

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
a stroke put me in this wheelchair.

11:51.280 --> 11:53.880
Get ahead with the rubber-glove
inspection!

11:53.880 --> 11:57.640
Have you considered living any place
cheerier? People around?

11:57.640 --> 11:59.560
          A nursing home?

11:59.560 --> 12:01.760
I've watched my friends go in there.

12:01.760 --> 12:05.160
People capable of taking care of
themselves.

12:05.160 --> 12:07.840
In six months they were like hothouse
flowers.

12:07.840 --> 12:11.840
No, sir. I have lived here and I'll
die here.

12:12.680 --> 12:15.000
How are you feeling?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.680
    Palpitations now and again.

12:17.680 --> 12:19.360
Forget to take your heart medicine?

12:19.360 --> 12:20.560
Forget to take your heart medicine?
          Of course not!

12:20.560 --> 12:22.080
    Do you think I'm an idiot?

12:22.080 --> 12:23.320
I'll want you to breathe...

I'll want you to breathe...
          I AM breathing!

    If I weren't, I'd be dead.

12:26.560 --> 12:30.040
Right.

12:30.040 --> 12:34.040
You say this patient of yours,
he didn't have the faintest idea

12:35.080 --> 12:36.120
who he was?

12:36.120 --> 12:38.360
You removed a lesion from his brain?

12:38.360 --> 12:40.080
 After he fooled us into thinking

12:40.080 --> 12:42.680
he was the head of the Residency
Review Committee.

12:42.680 --> 12:43.640
Mary Richards.

12:43.640 --> 12:44.720
Mary Richards.
          That was later.

12:44.720 --> 12:46.800
Now he thinks
he's William Shakespeare?

12:46.800 --> 12:47.920
Now he thinks
he's William Shakespeare?
          I'm afraid so.

12:47.920 --> 12:50.640
William and Mary.

12:50.640 --> 12:53.280
The old boy's eyes are pointed
towards the South.

12:53.280 --> 12:54.320
           Here we are.

12:54.320 --> 12:58.320
Darling.

12:59.520 --> 13:01.120
Having a go at timing.

13:01.120 --> 13:02.560
I'm stuck.

13:02.560 --> 13:05.480
Should I keep this a satire or make
this a tragedy?

13:05.480 --> 13:09.000
         This is John Doe.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.120
Good God!

13:10.120 --> 13:13.440
What lady is that that doth enrich
the hand of yonder night.

13:13.440 --> 13:14.960
            Mrs Hedley.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.320
Sweet thought to lie between the
maiden's legs.

13:17.320 --> 13:19.120
Enough about country matters.

13:19.120 --> 13:21.640
I've never seen this man before in
my life.

13:21.640 --> 13:25.640
This man is not my brother.

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
(LAUGHS)

13:36.240 --> 13:38.920
Blood's pressure's high. A few rails
in your lungs.

13:38.920 --> 13:41.120
I'll have to adjust your heart
medicine.

13:41.120 --> 13:44.880
Every new doctor changes the
medicine.

13:44.880 --> 13:48.880
First it was digitalis, then it was
hydrolozine.

13:49.760 --> 13:52.080
Can't you people make up your minds?

13:52.080 --> 13:56.080
Doctor Genko took care of me almost
all of my life until he died.

13:57.600 --> 14:01.360
  All he needed was a stethoscope

14:01.360 --> 14:02.920
    and he could fix anything.

14:02.920 --> 14:06.520
Send your blood in for tests and the
X-ray van will come by tomorrow.

14:06.520 --> 14:09.800
     Tell them to bring fuses.

14:09.800 --> 14:12.280
The last time, they kept blowing
mine.

14:12.280 --> 14:16.000
We could take care of everything in
one visit

14:16.000 --> 14:18.120
if you would just come to the
hospital.

14:18.120 --> 14:21.560
Sure. Find somebody to wheel me to
the bus.

14:21.560 --> 14:25.280
Then see another strange doctor who
rushes me from floor to floor

14:25.280 --> 14:27.920
 half naked in front of the public

14:27.920 --> 14:30.880
and never takes the time to get to
know me.

14:30.880 --> 14:32.240
Never mind.

14:32.240 --> 14:36.240
Ever use that thing?

14:37.640 --> 14:39.360
      That's a player piano.

14:39.360 --> 14:41.800
Does it look like I could pump the
pedals?

14:41.800 --> 14:44.360
Just asking.

14:44.360 --> 14:47.240
My husband and I used to play and
sing along.

14:47.240 --> 14:50.160
If one of us heard the other start
pedalling,

14:50.160 --> 14:52.720
it meant we were gonna make love
that night.

14:52.720 --> 14:54.920
      That was 30 years ago.

14:54.920 --> 14:57.400
    It's horrible getting old.

14:57.400 --> 14:59.960
         Your body aches.

14:59.960 --> 15:03.000
    It's just a piece of junk.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.760
   You wouldn't know about that.

15:04.760 --> 15:07.680
You've got your whole life ahead of
you. Mine was over

15:07.680 --> 15:11.680
  before they landed on the moon.

15:12.200 --> 15:16.200
   Frankly, I'd rather be dead.

15:20.440 --> 15:24.320
Leave me alone.

15:24.320 --> 15:28.320
     You ought to wear a hat!

15:41.360 --> 15:43.520
     I like that view myself.

15:43.520 --> 15:47.520
One patient said he could see four
states from here. States of mind.

15:50.360 --> 15:52.400
They look different.

15:52.400 --> 15:55.320
     Who?  Lucinda and Ramsay.

15:55.320 --> 15:57.040
          Say that again.

15:57.040 --> 16:01.040
They acted rather...
How shall I say it?

16:01.160 --> 16:02.480
Weird.

16:02.480 --> 16:05.520
   You knew those people today?

16:05.520 --> 16:08.760
My sister Lucinda
and her husband Ramsay.

16:08.760 --> 16:12.760
I was born June 13th, 1946,
Baton Rouge.

16:13.440 --> 16:17.040
Brought up Guidon district
of New Orleans.

16:17.040 --> 16:21.040
Champion fisherman, world record
landed off the delta, July 1977.

16:21.560 --> 16:25.560
Real estate holdings in Mississippi,
Baton Rouge and Lake Pontratrain.

16:26.600 --> 16:30.600
Major philanthropist for Tulane,
made millions in off-shore oil rigs.

16:32.320 --> 16:36.320
Summa cum laude English Lit LSU.
You don't believe me?

16:37.840 --> 16:41.840
You've played quite a few roles
since we met.

16:42.040 --> 16:45.560
This one's real.
I know who I am now.

16:45.560 --> 16:49.560
Seeing them made it
click into place.

16:50.200 --> 16:53.280
I'm Thomas Pendleton Ferrar.

16:53.280 --> 16:56.480
If you're their brother,
why didn't they say?

16:56.480 --> 16:58.520
I don't know.

16:58.520 --> 17:02.040
But I want to go home.

17:02.040 --> 17:06.040
Helen, why wasn't Mr Perret
given his morning medication?

17:06.079 --> 17:09.760
Does someone have a grudge
against his recovery?

17:09.760 --> 17:13.760
I wasn't here. I was being
interrogated by a shyster lawyer.

17:14.599 --> 17:18.119
Me Perret's pulse was 42 -
it's in his chart.

17:18.119 --> 17:21.640
And some people can't face
the music.

17:21.640 --> 17:25.640
¤15,000 dollars in punitive damages.
Where am I gonna get that?

17:26.520 --> 17:28.040
Mud wrestling?

17:28.040 --> 17:32.040
         Have a nice day.

17:34.360 --> 17:38.360
Did you enjoy putting me through
hell?! Insults, insinuations!

17:39.400 --> 17:42.840
You threw the punch, honey.
You provoked it.

17:42.840 --> 17:46.640
Besides, I've seen you
treat patients worse.

17:46.640 --> 17:50.240
Nobody here likes you -
you treat people like dirt.

17:50.240 --> 17:54.240
Are you so miserable that you have
to make others pay for it?

17:54.280 --> 17:58.280
Don't talk to me that way.

18:05.560 --> 18:09.080
# BEETHOVEN Fifth Symphony
              Hello.

18:09.080 --> 18:12.640
Forgive my intrusion but oh,
it's imperative I talk to you

18:12.640 --> 18:14.960
about my poor, demented brother.

18:14.960 --> 18:18.960
Doctor Auschlander, that man
we saw today was most certainly  Tom!

18:20.760 --> 18:24.280
   His recall was extraordinary.

18:24.280 --> 18:28.240
I'm here without my wife's
cogniscense.

18:28.240 --> 18:32.240
She's always hiring detectives
to hunt down Tom
when he's on one of his escapades.

18:33.960 --> 18:37.960
You never know who'll be dressed up
as next.  I've no desire to pry.

18:39.080 --> 18:43.080
Whenever he got peculiar,
Lucinda took charge of the company.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.640
Or rather I did.

18:45.640 --> 18:49.200
She had legal control
but I was the one

18:49.200 --> 18:53.200
who kept the whole shebang
from going to the dogs.

18:53.760 --> 18:57.760
You have a very  real  responsibility
toward him.

18:58.800 --> 19:01.280
    You  must  take him!  I agree.

19:01.280 --> 19:05.280
But Lucinda doesn't want Tommy
at home.

19:05.440 --> 19:08.640
Without him she owns  everything!

19:08.640 --> 19:12.640
The company, the family fortune,
every cent in her lily-white hands!

19:14.280 --> 19:17.160
Why did she come to find him?

19:17.160 --> 19:21.160
I begged her on my knees! She
weakened into a state of honour.

19:22.880 --> 19:26.880
But the sight of her brother
froze that heart of hers

19:27.880 --> 19:31.880
harder than the winter soil
of the Delta. Oh, it's a crime!

19:34.160 --> 19:38.160
You see, Lucinda can be cold
and Lucinda can be callous.

19:40.200 --> 19:44.200
She also has a fixation
for German shepherds.

19:44.840 --> 19:46.120
         What do you want?

19:46.120 --> 19:50.120
I know you are a stranger.
However, I have always depended
on the kindness of strangers.

19:52.760 --> 19:56.760
Help me get Tom away from
that goldilocked iron butterfly

19:57.200 --> 19:59.960
or she'll drive him more loony!

19:59.960 --> 20:03.960
Yes,  she  was the one
but I could help that poor boy

20:04.480 --> 20:07.000
back into his right wits.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.440
              Well...

20:09.440 --> 20:13.440
Make me the legal guardian
of his rehabilitation.

20:16.640 --> 20:19.600
Some were here. Yeah, here we are.

20:19.600 --> 20:23.600
Me and my wife, the house act at
the old Howard Theatre for 20 years.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
They tore the place down in '62.
There's an article about it.

20:32.680 --> 20:36.680
      Here, somewhere. There.

20:37.120 --> 20:39.480
   They razed it to the ground.

20:39.480 --> 20:43.480
Helen and I sang up a storm in there.
I miss her every day at show time.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.720
Quite a collection you have there.

20:50.720 --> 20:54.720
Yeah, well, I pass the time
sifting through it.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.440
Don't you get out?

20:56.440 --> 20:59.960
Not when it's slick,
it's too dangerous.

20:59.960 --> 21:03.960
         Now I hibernate.

21:05.640 --> 21:08.720
Sad time, winter.  You have any kids?

21:08.720 --> 21:12.000
  Jeanie somewhere in California.

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
  I had a row with the other one.

21:16.240 --> 21:19.720
Helen and I were together 70 years.

21:19.720 --> 21:22.880
The best companion a fella
could ever want.

21:22.880 --> 21:25.400
        Passed away in '84

21:25.400 --> 21:29.400
during the closing ceremony
of the Olympics.

21:30.440 --> 21:34.440
That Lionel Ritchie was singing
All Night Long.

21:37.600 --> 21:41.600
Helen never made it.
Got her obit here.

21:42.120 --> 21:46.120
 Partner and wife of Harry Cragan.

21:46.360 --> 21:47.560
               Hard.

21:47.560 --> 21:51.560
Your blood sugar seems OK.
I'll listen to your lungs.

21:52.720 --> 21:55.240
You been feeling OK?

21:55.240 --> 21:57.760
    Yeah - good days, bad days.

21:57.760 --> 22:00.840
           My legs hurt, no appetite.

22:00.840 --> 22:04.840
 And lately I've got...plumbing...

22:05.400 --> 22:07.160
No pressure?

22:07.160 --> 22:11.160
Yeah.
It starts and then it just quits.

22:11.200 --> 22:15.200
Well, it's not unusual
to have a decrease in tumescence.

22:15.240 --> 22:17.440
                         I...

22:17.440 --> 22:21.440
I met Helen in the first grade
and said, "She's the one."

22:23.040 --> 22:27.040
We slept together in one bed
for 60 years after we were married

22:28.080 --> 22:32.080
    no matter if one of us was sick.

22:33.880 --> 22:37.160
       She had the left side. I...

22:37.160 --> 22:39.680
                    Her hair, she...

22:39.680 --> 22:43.680
     She combed her hair 100 times.

22:44.680 --> 22:46.440
                            She...

22:46.440 --> 22:50.440
                        Oh, for...

22:52.400 --> 22:56.400
I always thought
my wife would outlive me.

23:02.360 --> 23:03.880
Dr Westphall.

23:03.880 --> 23:05.960
Why aren't you on your house calls?

23:05.960 --> 23:08.480
I made two visits.  Not six patients?

23:08.480 --> 23:11.360
I couldn't take any more.  In here.

23:11.360 --> 23:15.360
What the hell is your problem,
Fiscus?

23:15.440 --> 23:17.640
I can't work with old people.

23:17.640 --> 23:19.240
 You're a doctor!

23:19.240 --> 23:22.280
They need people to relate to them.

23:22.280 --> 23:26.280
The first one hated me on sight,
and just wanted to die.

23:26.320 --> 23:30.000
The second was living in the past.
 I'm trained to save lives.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.240
If there's a heartbeat,
you keep it pumping.

23:32.240 --> 23:34.320
I can't watch these people
dry up and blow away.

23:34.320 --> 23:36.920
I can't watch these people
dry up and blow away.
All I hear from you is complaints.

23:36.920 --> 23:38.360
HONKING

23:38.360 --> 23:42.120
       Would you excuse us?

23:42.120 --> 23:44.400
I don't know how to
deal with these patients.

23:44.400 --> 23:45.680
        You're a smart-ass.

23:45.680 --> 23:49.680
Why don't you use your brain for
something besides chasing skirts?

23:50.760 --> 23:53.800
People need a purpose in life,
understand?

23:53.800 --> 23:56.360
I had a patient in Ethiopia
in her 70s.

23:56.360 --> 23:58.880
     She was dying by degrees.

23:58.880 --> 24:01.840
While I was there I delivered
a baby.

24:01.840 --> 24:03.840
    The mother died in labour.

24:03.840 --> 24:07.440
There was no-one to take care
of this child so I asked Sisa.

24:07.440 --> 24:11.440
She was reluctant at first, but when
I left, she and the baby had moved
into the camp together.

24:12.360 --> 24:15.720
So I'm supposed to find orphaned
babies for everyone?

24:15.720 --> 24:19.720
In ER, you're accustomed to
the moment of death - the instant.

24:20.200 --> 24:23.800
Dying takes longer than that for
most, it takes years of living,

24:23.800 --> 24:27.800
growing old. Helping to maintain is
as important as trying to save it.

24:28.800 --> 24:32.800
I'm not changing your assignment.
I don't wanna talk about it.

24:36.720 --> 24:40.720
There's no reason for you to sell
short. They've bottomed out.

24:41.360 --> 24:43.800
It's even jumped an eighth
while we were talking.

24:43.800 --> 24:45.240
KNOCK ON DOOR

24:45.240 --> 24:49.240
Fine, you're the client. I'll write
it up and call you tomorrow.

24:51.240 --> 24:52.480
Look who's here.

24:52.480 --> 24:54.520
Thought I'd see how
you two are doing.

24:54.520 --> 24:57.360
We're gonna talk to the adoption
people this week.

24:57.360 --> 24:59.480
           What people?

24:59.480 --> 25:01.920
Dr Ehrlich's suggestion.

25:01.920 --> 25:03.920
    Aren't you rushing things?

25:03.920 --> 25:07.120
Five months of trying to have
a baby's not rushing.

25:07.120 --> 25:08.840
     You're willing to adopt?

25:08.840 --> 25:10.400
What's wrong with that?

25:10.400 --> 25:12.320
  It depends on your perspective.

25:12.320 --> 25:14.960
Would you want to be somebody's
solution?

25:14.960 --> 25:17.040
I had a wonderful life.

25:17.040 --> 25:19.800
My adoptive parents loved me.
We can do the same thing.

25:19.800 --> 25:21.920
Let me tell you what you're up
against.

25:21.920 --> 25:25.920
Through public agencies
you have to wait up to a month
for an appointment.

25:26.520 --> 25:30.360
Then you have to wait to fill out
forms, be interviewed.

25:30.360 --> 25:32.920
There are 1,000s of children that
need homes.

25:32.920 --> 25:34.200
     But they're not infants.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.560
It's gotta be a baby.

25:35.560 --> 25:39.560
They're mainly black or Hispanic -
most couples want a child that
looks like them.

25:39.760 --> 25:43.080
I...I didn't even consider this.

25:43.080 --> 25:45.400
What if we went out of state?

25:45.400 --> 25:49.040
First, you have to fill out a spec
sheet describing yourselves.

25:49.040 --> 25:52.320
Then take it to every OB you
can find,

25:52.320 --> 25:56.320
and hope they'll pass it to a doctor,
who might have a patient,
who may be having a baby.

25:56.480 --> 25:57.760
Then?

25:57.760 --> 26:01.760
             You wait.

26:06.640 --> 26:08.080
Dr Auschlander.

26:08.080 --> 26:11.800
I've been trying to reach you.

26:11.800 --> 26:14.360
 I haven't been back to the Ritz.

26:14.360 --> 26:18.360
I'm avoiding my husband. He'd be
upset that I was talking to you.

26:18.840 --> 26:20.000
Please sit.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.480
        Thank you so much.

26:21.480 --> 26:23.440
May I get you something?

26:23.440 --> 26:26.120
My head is still spinning
from this morning.

26:26.120 --> 26:30.120
Imagine finding your baby brother
after all those years.

26:31.720 --> 26:33.120
            I'm elated.

26:33.120 --> 26:35.120
You admit he's your brother?

26:35.120 --> 26:36.840
            Of course.

26:36.840 --> 26:39.280
     I'm sorry I lied to you.

26:39.280 --> 26:41.160
Why did you pretend not to know him?

26:41.160 --> 26:44.200
          I was stunned.

26:44.200 --> 26:48.200
Tom in that hospital bed, in those
clothes, babbling Shakespeare.

26:49.920 --> 26:53.920
He's always been eccentric,
but never so far.

26:55.600 --> 26:56.880
I don't follow.

26:56.880 --> 27:00.040
          How could you?

27:00.040 --> 27:03.000
  Tom and Ramsay hate each other.

27:03.000 --> 27:07.000
They always have and for good reason.

27:07.200 --> 27:11.080
Could you get me
a glass and some ice, please?

27:11.080 --> 27:15.080
Ramsay is a born drifter,
going from job to job.

27:17.360 --> 27:20.320
I didn't know that when we married.

27:20.320 --> 27:23.640
I thought he was a gentleman,
a gentleman of leisure.

27:23.640 --> 27:27.640
Then I found out,
our wedding was his windfall.

27:27.720 --> 27:30.840
Of course, I was just never bred
to pragmatism.

27:30.840 --> 27:33.840
At any rate, as long
as I control the finances,

27:33.840 --> 27:36.560
Ramsey will get
a very liberal allowance,

27:36.560 --> 27:40.560
but once Tom comes home,
Ramsay knows the milk train does not
stop here any more.

27:43.080 --> 27:45.880
What do you expect me to do?

27:45.880 --> 27:49.880
Oh, doctor! Only I can return
my dear brother to the bosom
of his loving family.

27:50.080 --> 27:52.360
This really isn't my line of work.

27:52.360 --> 27:53.560
                  Oh, doctor, please!

27:53.560 --> 27:57.560
Please. I've always depended
upon the kindness of strangers.

28:06.680 --> 28:08.000
                               Helen!

28:08.000 --> 28:12.000
I've been thinking things over.
We have to work together

28:12.600 --> 28:15.520
and we have to get along
and life's just so short.

28:15.520 --> 28:18.440
This case could drag on
in the courts for months.

28:18.440 --> 28:22.440
                                So...

28:24.040 --> 28:27.280
               There. Now we're even.

28:27.280 --> 28:31.280
               I'll drop the lawsuit.

28:35.600 --> 28:39.600
Hang on to this.

28:43.720 --> 28:46.480
Ah. Mr Tagliarino?

28:46.480 --> 28:50.480
               Yeah.

28:53.520 --> 28:55.680
Wayne, what are you doing in here?

28:55.680 --> 28:57.280
Hiding.

28:57.280 --> 28:58.800
Oh.

28:58.800 --> 29:02.200
According to this form, you've got
multiple contusions

29:02.200 --> 29:04.440
and a possible dislocated shoulder.

29:04.440 --> 29:06.600
Yeah. I got banged up
pretty good, huh?

29:06.600 --> 29:07.640
Uh-huh.

29:07.640 --> 29:10.320
Can we hurry up? I mean,
I gotta get back

29:10.320 --> 29:12.800
or they'll take me off
the depth chart.

29:12.800 --> 29:16.560
Yeah, step in here, middle cubicle.

29:16.560 --> 29:17.800
Have fun(!)

29:17.800 --> 29:20.280
Jack...

29:20.280 --> 29:24.280
You're a compassionate, caring,
rational human being, right?

29:24.480 --> 29:28.000
Well, I don't know...

29:28.000 --> 29:30.640
I like to think of myself as...

29:30.640 --> 29:32.680
But, you know, sometimes...

29:32.680 --> 29:35.040
Forget it.

29:35.040 --> 29:38.840
What's the problem?

29:38.840 --> 29:41.200
I can't complete
my community service.

29:41.200 --> 29:43.800
I can't face another musty apartment

29:43.800 --> 29:46.520
or waiting for some old fogy
to finish whizzing

29:46.520 --> 29:49.400
before I give them a rectal exam.

29:49.400 --> 29:53.160
I'll take the football hero.

29:53.160 --> 29:55.680
You're having a tough time
dealing with the old

29:55.680 --> 29:57.480
cos you're scared of getting old.

29:57.480 --> 29:58.760
I'm a Who fan.

29:58.760 --> 30:02.360
Well, life only give's us
two options. Age or dying.

30:02.360 --> 30:04.280
Well, always optimistic, eh, Jack?

30:04.280 --> 30:06.920
Were your arms above your head
before you got hit?

30:06.920 --> 30:08.520
Erm, yeah... Ah!

30:08.520 --> 30:11.760
I spent the first 30 years
of my life getting screwed up

30:11.760 --> 30:14.600
by my parents, bad friends,
bad drugs, bad sex.

30:14.600 --> 30:17.880
Just in the past year I've managed
to sort through my neuroses

30:17.880 --> 30:19.800
and keep the ones
that keep me going.

30:19.800 --> 30:22.400
My life is just starting
to make some sense.

30:22.400 --> 30:24.560
Have you had problems
with this before?

30:24.560 --> 30:25.120
No.

30:25.120 --> 30:27.640
No.
It's not happening all that quickly.
So, what?

30:27.640 --> 30:30.240
Another 30 years
before I get myself unscrewed?

30:30.240 --> 30:33.000
By that time I'm two strokes away
from the 18th green

30:33.000 --> 30:35.360
and one stroke away
from drooling on myself.

30:35.360 --> 30:38.040
Ten milligrams valium for IV.

30:38.040 --> 30:40.880
He seems whacked out. I thought
you were gonna help me.

30:40.880 --> 30:43.040
It's OK.

30:43.040 --> 30:44.760
I like this, seeing you upset.

30:44.760 --> 30:48.200
Great(!) I made the day of a guy
who slept through the '70s.

30:48.200 --> 30:50.640
No, no. You're always
so hip and funny.

30:50.640 --> 30:53.360
It's nice to know you're
as confused as I am.

30:53.360 --> 30:55.760
Like, when you decided
to freeze your sperm,

30:55.760 --> 30:58.160
cos you were afraid
time was passing you by.

30:58.160 --> 31:02.160
Oh... Take him to x-ray first.
I'll be right back.

31:10.520 --> 31:12.160
Wayne, look, I'm sorry.

31:12.160 --> 31:14.680
OK?

31:14.680 --> 31:18.680
All right, you're afraid
that you've wasted half your life.

31:19.400 --> 31:23.280
Well, imagine how
those old people feel.

31:23.280 --> 31:25.200
They're all alone, they're sick.

31:25.200 --> 31:29.200
Yeah, and whatever chances they had
at happiness are all used up.

31:29.240 --> 31:33.240
Well, you can't change what's gonna
happen but you can help them.

31:34.320 --> 31:38.320
And maybe, hopefully, when you and
I get there, someone will help us.

31:39.720 --> 31:42.960
Medical science has found out
how to prolong life

31:42.960 --> 31:46.240
but not what people should do
to fill the extra time.

31:46.240 --> 31:50.240
You eat the right food,
you exercise, you live 200 years.

31:50.400 --> 31:54.400
But there's no-one left to call.

31:58.560 --> 32:02.560
BICYCLE HORN TOOTS

32:08.400 --> 32:10.400
Phil! Your line of stuffings
are in.

32:10.400 --> 32:13.360
Ought to buy one for Roxanne.
Almost the same hair-do!

32:13.360 --> 32:15.200
Does your mouth bypass your brain

32:15.200 --> 32:18.040
or do you actually think before
making a suggestion?

32:18.040 --> 32:21.480
OK, forget it. Don't send it. I just
figured since you had that tiff,

32:21.480 --> 32:24.000
before she left for Backwoods,
Mississippi...

32:24.000 --> 32:25.320
I just saw the Valeres.

32:25.320 --> 32:28.480
They told me you set them up
with an adoption counsellor.

32:28.480 --> 32:29.640
Yeah.

32:29.640 --> 32:32.360
They rejected
the surrogate mother idea.

32:32.360 --> 32:35.920
How could you just walk in and
offer them both sides of the menu?

32:35.920 --> 32:39.200
They need to step back,
forget about kids and go to Hawaii.

32:39.200 --> 32:42.320
But instead you pushed 'em back
into the ring!

32:42.320 --> 32:45.400
They want children.
They're angry we haven't succeeded.

32:45.400 --> 32:47.400
The problem won't go away
on vacation.

32:47.400 --> 32:51.400
Look. I've worked with them.
Why didn't you consult me?

32:51.480 --> 32:52.800
                 Judgement call, pal.

32:52.800 --> 32:56.800
Why don't the Valeres just put a kid
on their gold card?

32:57.720 --> 33:01.720
No wonder Caldwell bounced you
out of surgery.

33:09.400 --> 33:13.400
Kinda cute...

33:14.480 --> 33:18.480
LOUD EXPLOSION

33:34.280 --> 33:36.440
        My God! Was anyone killed?

33:36.440 --> 33:37.480
Miraculously, no.

33:37.480 --> 33:41.480
Phil Chandler got the worst of it.
He's critical, still unconscious.

33:41.560 --> 33:43.680
You'd think we were living in Beirut.

33:43.680 --> 33:47.320
I suppose the anti-abortion fanatic
is responsible for this one too?

33:47.320 --> 33:48.760
Don't know for sure.

33:48.760 --> 33:52.760
Maybe it someone who thought we were
using stuffed animals for research.

33:53.360 --> 33:56.320
Mark, what are we gonna do
about this kind of violence?

33:56.320 --> 33:58.600
We're sitting ducks.

33:58.600 --> 34:02.600
What the hell is wrong with people?

34:07.360 --> 34:11.320
Very lucky, very, very lucky...

34:11.320 --> 34:12.960
BACKGROUND CHATTER

34:12.960 --> 34:14.400
                   Who goes first?

34:14.400 --> 34:16.120
Um, me.

34:16.120 --> 34:20.120
Please don't take this the wrong
way, but I'm...afraid of you.

34:21.440 --> 34:22.520
Oh, Tom!

34:22.520 --> 34:26.320
Look, Dr Auschlander, maybe
I should just stay here, you know...

34:26.320 --> 34:28.639
I've made nice friends,
I have a home...

34:28.639 --> 34:31.159
No, you have to go with your family.

34:31.159 --> 34:34.120
But there's something back in here
that makes me scared.

34:34.120 --> 34:37.440
No, no. You must leave St Eligius,
you're perfectly well.

34:37.440 --> 34:39.360
But after listening to all of this,

34:39.360 --> 34:42.560
I've decided it would be better
to let you go off by yourself

34:42.560 --> 34:46.080
rather than with either one of them.

34:46.080 --> 34:49.000
Ramsay, the time has come
for the truth.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.080
Oh, no, honey. Let's give lying
just one more chance.

34:52.080 --> 34:55.400
No. Tom, Ferrar Chemicals
is a disaster.

34:55.400 --> 34:59.400
This idiot I'm married to
has turned it to a financial swamp.

34:59.720 --> 35:01.920
You lie like a wooden rabbit!

35:01.920 --> 35:04.400
It was you who had a fit
when your daddy died

35:04.400 --> 35:06.520
and made Tommy
his one and only heir.

35:06.520 --> 35:10.520
Then, when he disappeared,
you pulled out your proxy

35:11.040 --> 35:13.680
but you knew nothing
about running a family business

35:13.680 --> 35:15.520
any more than you do about sobriety.

35:15.520 --> 35:16.680
Wait...

35:16.680 --> 35:19.480
You mean Tom really was good
at running the company?

35:19.480 --> 35:21.760
The little boy's a corporate genius.

35:21.760 --> 35:25.760
He made us into an empire. My brother
is a shrewd, calculating mastermind.

35:26.800 --> 35:30.800
Without you, Tom, we'll lose
everything. We'll be destitute.

35:31.000 --> 35:34.440
Broke. Everything gone
with the wind...

35:34.440 --> 35:36.400
I don't care.

35:36.400 --> 35:37.880
I don't wanna go back.

35:37.880 --> 35:40.200
That does it, you snivelling brat.

35:40.200 --> 35:42.880
This time you'll hear the truth
and nothing but!

35:42.880 --> 35:46.880
You ran away because you knew
my marriage to Ramsay was over.

35:47.400 --> 35:48.720
Can I go back to my room?

35:48.720 --> 35:51.040
Oh, you have always romanticised us,
Tommy.

35:51.040 --> 35:54.200
Ever since the beginning.
We're no Benedict and Beatrice.

35:54.200 --> 35:57.400
And you are a very shrewd
and very practical businessman.

35:57.400 --> 35:59.880
You made millions in order
to sustain the image

35:59.880 --> 36:02.280
of that romantic couple
that you worshipped.

36:02.280 --> 36:05.280
When the family was threatened
with extinction

36:05.280 --> 36:08.720
you became delusional, delirious,
and disappeared.

36:08.720 --> 36:11.160
Liars!

36:11.160 --> 36:15.160
No, Tom. This time it really is
the truth and you know it.

36:24.160 --> 36:27.920
Yes, it is true.
I'm coming home with you.

36:27.920 --> 36:30.160
Hallelujah!

36:30.160 --> 36:32.280
                      What an escape!

36:32.280 --> 36:36.280
No escape, Lucinda. I'm comin'
to New Orleans.

36:36.360 --> 36:40.360
Things are gonna change.
No more booze...

36:40.360 --> 36:41.440
                                  Oh!

36:41.440 --> 36:45.000
And you! You'll have to earn
your own living at the company.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.960
And both of you must agree
to patch up your differences

36:47.960 --> 36:50.200
and restore our family
or I won't return.

36:50.200 --> 36:54.200
Sweet babe, I think we have created
our own little Frankenstein.

36:55.760 --> 36:59.200
              My God!

36:59.200 --> 37:02.120
You haven't said a word
since Dr Chandler left.

37:02.120 --> 37:06.120
Yeah. You know me, Ken.
What does that usually mean?

37:07.320 --> 37:11.320
            My first BMW. A used 528.

37:12.040 --> 37:14.800
Would you explain
that little cryptogram?

37:14.800 --> 37:18.800
I'd gone to the dealer
to buy a new 528, not in stock.

37:19.320 --> 37:22.400
So I settled for somebody's
old car as my new car.

37:22.400 --> 37:24.960
I was never happy tooling
around Boston

37:24.960 --> 37:27.080
until I had bought a brand new 528.

37:27.080 --> 37:30.320
I think "tool" is the operative
word here, isn't it?

37:30.320 --> 37:34.320
Ken, I may have been adopted
but I was never anybody's used car.

37:34.720 --> 37:37.840
The only way you can relate
to things is in financial terms.

37:37.840 --> 37:41.000
Possessions. You are
the most selfish person I know.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.600
We both are, Terri,
because wanting our own kid

37:43.600 --> 37:46.200
who looks and walks and talks
like us is selfish.

37:46.200 --> 37:47.320
I'm aware of that.

37:47.320 --> 37:49.840
That's why I wanna adopt even more.
Without you.

37:49.840 --> 37:52.640
Don't start threatening
divorce again, Terri.

37:52.640 --> 37:54.360
    I might just take you up on it.

37:54.360 --> 37:56.640
Good. You can re-marry,
have your own kids.

37:56.640 --> 37:58.880
Hell, you could wax 'em
in your driveway!

37:58.880 --> 38:00.480
&lt; I'll meet you at the car.

38:00.480 --> 38:01.600
Hey, Ken? &gt;

38:01.600 --> 38:02.280
               What?

38:02.280 --> 38:06.280
               What?
Go clone yourself.

38:13.240 --> 38:14.680
Anything?

38:14.680 --> 38:17.600
CAT scans normal
but he's got a severe concussion.

38:17.600 --> 38:20.360
That was close.

38:20.360 --> 38:22.560
Yeah, he's lucky to be in one piece.

38:22.560 --> 38:26.280
No, I meant me. Another few seconds
gabbing with him about the Valeres

38:26.280 --> 38:28.640
and I'd have been wearing
a Purple Heart too.

38:28.640 --> 38:31.920
Not many people live through
two explosions in two days.

38:31.920 --> 38:34.840
Not many people encounter
two explosions in two days.

38:34.840 --> 38:37.920
Must run in his family. His brother
and that mine in Vietnam...

38:37.920 --> 38:39.960
Does anybody know
where the bomb was?

38:39.960 --> 38:43.040
In a cleaning cart.

38:43.040 --> 38:44.280
Who are you?

38:44.280 --> 38:47.840
Something had to be done.

38:47.840 --> 38:49.960
That's why I planted the bombs here.

38:49.960 --> 38:53.440
After I'd reduced the woman's
clinic to fire and brimstone.

38:53.440 --> 38:55.520
Well, go ahead. Call the cops.

38:55.520 --> 38:58.000
I intend to be arrested
so people will know.

38:58.000 --> 39:02.000
He's the bomber? Aloha...

39:06.520 --> 39:10.520
Get security in 3304, now.

39:13.080 --> 39:15.120
So people will know what?

39:15.120 --> 39:17.200
That I was doing God's work.

39:17.200 --> 39:21.200
You killed a woman yesterday.
He might never regain consciousness.

39:21.440 --> 39:22.800
You're a murderer.

39:22.800 --> 39:25.400
I'm a warrior. A soldier.

39:25.400 --> 39:28.680
I defend the lives of children
who can't defend themselves.

39:28.680 --> 39:32.080
The institutional murder
of innocents must be eradicated.

39:32.080 --> 39:34.240
I don't believe in abortion either.

39:34.240 --> 39:37.920
St Eligius shouldn't be doing it
but bombs don't accomplish anything.

39:37.920 --> 39:40.480
How can you say you defend lives
while you kill?

39:40.480 --> 39:41.560
How can you?

39:41.560 --> 39:42.760
It's the law.

39:42.760 --> 39:46.760
There's a higher law.
You work in a death camp...

39:47.560 --> 39:49.080
This man is my friend.

39:49.080 --> 39:53.080
Well, sometimes the born must die
to save the unborn.

39:53.640 --> 39:57.640
Go ahead. Go ahead, do it.

39:59.320 --> 40:01.520
You're crazy.

40:01.520 --> 40:04.600
No. No, I have a family.

40:04.600 --> 40:08.360
I have friends.

40:08.360 --> 40:12.360

Good night.

40:33.880 --> 40:34.960
Wait...

40:34.960 --> 40:38.120
I brought a friend with me.

40:38.120 --> 40:41.040
Wouldn't you like some company?

40:41.040 --> 40:44.440
Oh, I haven't got anything to eat.

40:44.440 --> 40:47.560
That's OK. A couple of minutes?

40:47.560 --> 40:49.120
Well, come in.

40:49.120 --> 40:53.120
OK.

40:53.960 --> 40:56.880
Wipe your feet.

40:56.880 --> 41:00.160
Harry Cragan,
this is Sophia Pavlon.

41:00.160 --> 41:01.000
How do you do?

41:01.000 --> 41:02.560
How do you do?
             Not well.

41:02.560 --> 41:04.200
Me neither.

41:04.200 --> 41:07.880
Harry Cragan...
That's a familiar name.

41:07.880 --> 41:11.440
My wife and I used to perform
at the old Howard Theatre.

41:11.440 --> 41:14.080
      Oh, no. That's not it.

41:14.080 --> 41:16.000
Oh, yeah. Don't you remember?

41:16.000 --> 41:18.960
Cragan and Cragan?
Dancing, duets...

41:18.960 --> 41:22.960
Oh, yes. I do remember both of you.

41:23.120 --> 41:27.120
I remember that she had a tin ear and
you lumbered around like a buffalo.

41:29.240 --> 41:33.240
           A pair of real amateurs. &gt;

41:36.920 --> 41:40.920
Oh, Ramsay. I'm really terribly
happy and very, very relieved.

41:41.400 --> 41:43.920
&lt; So am I, precious angel, so am I.

41:43.920 --> 41:47.440
Out of order. You'll have
to take the stairs.

41:47.440 --> 41:49.520
I know you two
are gonna make a go of it.

41:49.520 --> 41:53.520
Oh, Tom, didn't you know Ramsay and
I love each other and always will?

41:53.640 --> 41:55.600
Yeah, insanely, no matter what!

41:55.600 --> 41:59.600
Oh, Dr Chandler! Thank you so much
for everything you've done.

41:59.840 --> 42:00.960
I did very little.

42:00.960 --> 42:03.280
Oh, but you did it so beautifully.

42:03.280 --> 42:05.520
Much ado about nothing.

42:05.520 --> 42:07.160
   Much Ado About Nothing... Oh!

42:07.160 --> 42:11.160
"I do love thee with so much of my
heart that none is left to protest."

42:12.680 --> 42:16.680
"Come, bid me do anything for thee."

42:19.760 --> 42:23.760
Thank you.

42:27.520 --> 42:30.440
Well... It's good bye.

42:30.440 --> 42:31.800
Good bye.

42:31.800 --> 42:35.800
When I was Tom Ferrar, magnate,
I had no friends.

42:36.280 --> 42:40.280
But as John Doe, a nobody,
you cared. That made things easier.

42:41.960 --> 42:44.920
I'll be sending a hefty
contribution to the hospital.

42:44.920 --> 42:46.440
We could use the help.

42:46.440 --> 42:48.520
Identity's a funny thing, ain't it?

42:48.520 --> 42:52.360
Now I know my name but do I really
know who I am?

42:52.360 --> 42:56.280
Does anybody? One's true self
is the most elusive thing in life.

42:56.280 --> 43:00.280
Easily lost, hard to find.

43:00.920 --> 43:04.920
No. Hard to live with.

43:07.680 --> 43:10.960
But I'll try!

43:10.960 --> 43:14.960
"Exit, pursued by a bear"!

43:18.680 --> 43:20.800
Don't you like having company?

43:20.800 --> 43:23.640
     Get that old geezer out of here!

43:23.640 --> 43:25.400
Harry's a nice man.

43:25.400 --> 43:26.720
                     He depresses me.

A sanitarium in New Orleans called
to say that two people escaped

44:44.160 --> 44:46.720
and were headed to Boston
to look for a friend.

44:46.720 --> 44:50.200
