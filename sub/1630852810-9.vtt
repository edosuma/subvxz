WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.925
[opening theme music playing]

00:10.010 --> 00:11.344
[man] Hey!

00:21.730 --> 00:23.982
[thudding]

00:25.859 --> 00:26.860
-[wheels screech]
-[all grunt]

00:26.943 --> 00:30.572
[Turbish] Welcome to Dreamland!
Thank you for traveling Turbish Express!

00:30.655 --> 00:31.781
Oh, thank God.

00:31.865 --> 00:35.452
This little piggy's had to wee-wee-wee
all the way home. Stand aside.

00:36.369 --> 00:38.288
Oh, Turbish, how considerate of you.

00:38.371 --> 00:40.915
I'm not kneeling, I'm dying.

00:40.999 --> 00:42.542
-Wait a minute.
-[Turbish] Oh!

00:42.625 --> 00:44.753
What the hell is that weird green smoke?

00:44.836 --> 00:45.920
[Luci gibbers]

00:46.004 --> 00:47.714
Here. Stole 'em from Odval.

00:50.008 --> 00:52.343
[Bean gasps] Look,
just beyond Mount Ominous!

00:52.427 --> 00:54.053
Hey, everybody stop worrying.

00:54.137 --> 00:56.306
Probably just an army
marching here to kill you all.

00:56.389 --> 00:58.767
I'm gonna go get a snack.
Hey, do I look fat?

00:58.850 --> 00:59.684
'Cause you do.

00:59.768 --> 01:02.062
[scatting]

01:02.145 --> 01:03.563
Yeah, you're gonna die soon.

01:03.646 --> 01:05.356
[clears throat and scats]

01:05.440 --> 01:07.358
But who'd want to attack Dreamland?

01:07.442 --> 01:10.653
Besides Bentwood.
Or Dankmire. Or Steamland.

01:10.737 --> 01:13.364
Or those teenagers
we ran over a while back.

01:13.448 --> 01:16.785
You have an impressive
number of enemies for a girl your age.

01:16.868 --> 01:19.913
Face it, Bean,
neither one of us is destined to lead.

01:19.996 --> 01:22.123
You can't even keep track of your boots.

01:22.624 --> 01:24.334
[sighs] I miss footwear.

01:24.417 --> 01:25.960
I may not be destined to lead--

01:26.044 --> 01:28.505
-Or fit to lead.
-Ooh! Or equipped to lead.

01:28.588 --> 01:30.423
Or sociopathic enough to lead.

01:30.507 --> 01:32.634
[chuckles] Girl,
you are the wrong type of crazy.

01:32.717 --> 01:35.303
The last thing
this kingdom needs is more crazy.

01:35.386 --> 01:37.764
-[Zøg honking]
-[Bean] Uh-oh.

01:38.473 --> 01:40.141
All right, Zøg has stopped…

01:40.225 --> 01:42.185
[imitates Zøg's honking sounds]

01:42.268 --> 01:46.314
He's either fast asleep
or sitting very still in a quiet rage.

01:46.397 --> 01:47.607
Okay, Abner.

01:47.690 --> 01:52.737
Now tiptoe in and put the roast poodle
close enough to smell, but not too close.

01:52.821 --> 01:55.532
He's been known
to eat whole cushions in his sleep.

01:55.615 --> 01:57.033
Then, get the hell out fast.

01:57.117 --> 02:01.371
Are you ready? You ready? Okay.
You signed your will, right? Good. Go.

02:01.454 --> 02:02.330
[grunts]

02:04.332 --> 02:05.542
[Zøg] Hey, wait a minute.

02:05.625 --> 02:08.336
This ain't no poodle.
It tastes like Shih Tzu.

02:08.419 --> 02:10.380
[Abner] No! Not the catapult!

02:13.383 --> 02:14.300
[thuds]

02:15.677 --> 02:19.681
Oh, Turbish? Would you step in here
for a minute, please?

02:26.187 --> 02:29.816
[Oona] You are back?
Did you get Bentwood moneys and weapons?

02:29.899 --> 02:31.776
No, I screwed up royally.

02:31.860 --> 02:33.903
[Oona] That should be family motto.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.947
Wait, Oona, are you going somewhere?

02:36.698 --> 02:37.740
Whoa!

02:38.199 --> 02:39.617
Whoa, again!

02:39.701 --> 02:42.078
It's time to shed skin and leave, Bean.

02:42.162 --> 02:45.456
The longer I stay on land,
the weaker I appear on sea.

02:45.540 --> 02:49.961
Piracy is very cutthroat business,
is not even joke. Or isn't?

02:50.044 --> 02:51.880
But I can't do this without you!

02:51.963 --> 02:55.258
Elfo and Luci are all I have,
and that is not a deep bench.

02:55.341 --> 02:58.887
If I do not go now,
I cannot return when least expect.

02:58.970 --> 03:01.973
A powerful Oona
is more help to Bean in the future.

03:02.056 --> 03:04.517
But we might
not have a future if you leave now.

03:04.601 --> 03:07.353
Some kind of evil cloud cover
is coming our way.

03:07.437 --> 03:11.232
Don't be drama queen.
That is my job. Flourish.

03:11.816 --> 03:12.775
Oona, no!

03:12.859 --> 03:16.696
You'll know what to do.
You are more capable than you don't think.

03:16.779 --> 03:18.364
Goodbye, crazy girl.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.117
[suction noises]

03:23.745 --> 03:25.330
Ooh. Gecko style.

03:25.413 --> 03:27.498
[Oona] Not gecko, newt!

03:29.542 --> 03:31.085
This feels nice.

03:31.169 --> 03:35.340
Yeah. And once I sprinkle it with glitter,
you'll look like a right badass.

03:36.007 --> 03:39.510
Derek. Oh!
And new angry fairy girl I like.

03:39.594 --> 03:42.055
[Snarla] Hey, Oona, how's it hanging?

03:42.138 --> 03:45.725
Oh, by suction cups.
Listen, I must vamoose for a while.

03:45.808 --> 03:48.645
Well, what about me?
I don't wanna stay in Dreamland.

03:48.728 --> 03:51.940
Bean and Dad
are just really emotionally draining.

03:52.023 --> 03:54.317
Plus, I'm not the cute one anymore.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.945
Yeah, but a few scars
and a tattoo of a naked me,

03:57.028 --> 03:58.279
you'll be my dream geezer.

03:58.363 --> 04:01.783
Goodbye, Derek.
I love you. Don't follow me.

04:01.866 --> 04:03.117
[suction noises receding]

04:03.785 --> 04:05.620
Well, those are mixed messages.

04:06.704 --> 04:10.625
Mommy, wait! My needs outweigh your scorn!

04:11.376 --> 04:13.002
[adventurous music playing]

04:13.086 --> 04:14.504
Set sail!

04:14.587 --> 04:16.005
[water splashing]

04:16.089 --> 04:17.465
[Derek grunts]

04:17.548 --> 04:18.800
Ugh, I knew it.

04:18.883 --> 04:20.760
I swallowed a lot of sea water.

04:23.846 --> 04:26.349
Derek and Oona. I'm gonna miss her.

04:26.891 --> 04:28.309
[Oona yelling]

04:28.393 --> 04:30.561
[Bean] Damn it!
She took her drugs with her.

04:31.312 --> 04:34.482
Oh, no, the smoke's gone
from the Badlands to the Even Worse Lands!

04:34.565 --> 04:38.111
It's probably those smartass
teenagers getting high in the woods again.

04:38.194 --> 04:39.779
I'm glad we ran them over.

04:39.862 --> 04:43.449
We should start a gang and kick Elfo out.
We can call it "Luci and Friend."

04:43.533 --> 04:46.160
Shut up, boys. I gotta warn my nutty dad.

04:46.244 --> 04:48.162
It'll either cure him or kill him.

04:49.414 --> 04:52.292
Princess, you've returned.
What news of Bentwood?

04:52.375 --> 04:53.334
It's not good.

04:53.418 --> 04:56.212
Though, I did run into Grindl,
an old friend of Sorcerio's.

04:56.296 --> 05:00.675
-You went to wizarding school together?
-More of a wizarding community college.

05:00.758 --> 05:03.177
I flunked out because I was so overworked.

05:03.261 --> 05:06.764
It's hard being a wizard
and a golf caddy at the same time.

05:06.848 --> 05:09.142
Anyway, I've got to talk to my dad.

05:09.225 --> 05:10.101
Oh, ah… [smacks lips]

05:10.184 --> 05:13.604
You do not wanna go in there,
unless you're a fan of, like, dying.

05:13.688 --> 05:14.522
[chuckles]

05:14.605 --> 05:16.899
Perhaps you should
put on some armor first.

05:16.983 --> 05:19.152
Or an invisibility cloak.

05:19.235 --> 05:21.529
I had one here a minute ago.

05:21.612 --> 05:23.948
Oh, he's not gonna mess
with daddy's little girl.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.992
Or her fists of lead.

05:27.368 --> 05:29.620
I'm bettin' on, like, the fat guy.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.375
[Zøg babbling and honking]

05:36.669 --> 05:38.296
-Dad?
-[honks]

05:38.880 --> 05:40.590
-It's me.
-[honks]

05:41.215 --> 05:44.635
Your favorite kid? The drunken one?

05:44.719 --> 05:48.056
The big disappointment?
The one who shot you?

05:48.139 --> 05:49.265
[honks]

05:50.224 --> 05:52.310
Ah, Beanie…

05:52.393 --> 05:54.395
It's okay, Dad. I'm here for you.

05:54.479 --> 05:57.565
Let's not say anything
to anger El Porko Loco.

05:57.648 --> 05:58.900
[grunts]

05:59.817 --> 06:01.277
[screams]

06:01.360 --> 06:03.780
-Oh! Duck!
-Duck!

06:03.863 --> 06:05.865
Duck? Where? [grunts]

06:05.948 --> 06:07.116
-[grunts]
-[yelps]

06:07.200 --> 06:08.951
-[thud]
-[honks]

06:09.535 --> 06:12.705
[Mertz] I was hiding
under the throne since Tuesday.

06:12.789 --> 06:15.875
[sighs] At least
this side of his head is undamaged.

06:16.375 --> 06:20.296
Look at that glowering old fool.
It's clear he's unfit to lead.

06:20.379 --> 06:22.256
-[Bean] You think?
-[all gasp]

06:22.340 --> 06:23.841
Tiabeanie, you know that…

06:23.925 --> 06:26.511
[both] Women are not permitted
to speak in the council chambers.

06:26.594 --> 06:27.512
[both] It's the law.

06:27.595 --> 06:30.181
-It's a stupid law.
-[all gasp]

06:30.264 --> 06:32.809
Why don't you just stop
gasping and change the law?

06:32.892 --> 06:34.977
Only the king can change the law.

06:35.061 --> 06:37.438
But right now,
he can't even change himself.

06:37.522 --> 06:40.233
You heard me correctly.
The king is bediapered.

06:40.316 --> 06:41.192
[all gasping and muttering]

06:41.275 --> 06:44.487
Stop harrumphing!
We've got far more pressing matters!

06:44.570 --> 06:46.072
[grunts] This is ridiculous!

06:46.155 --> 06:50.743
King Zøg is a danger to himself
and, more important, to me.

06:50.827 --> 06:53.162
He must be restrained
and put away somewhere.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.831
Then who will rule the kingdom?

06:54.914 --> 06:57.458
With Derek out at sea, no one.

06:57.542 --> 07:00.503
[shouts] You're going to have
a hard time keeping this quiet!

07:00.586 --> 07:03.464
I know a place we can keep
Zøg that's completely soundproof.

07:03.548 --> 07:05.508
It's where we put that zydeco band.

07:05.591 --> 07:10.054
That's right. Stan is talking,
of course, of the Old Castle Mental Ward.

07:10.138 --> 07:13.724
[Apothecary] But if we put Zøg down there,
who'll have the guts to talk to him?

07:13.808 --> 07:16.227
Not me. Hospitals give me the willies.

07:16.310 --> 07:19.313
Yes, that place creeps even me out.

07:19.397 --> 07:21.607
And you know me, I love zydeco.

07:21.691 --> 07:26.362
Well, the bigmouth princess
has a soothing influence over him.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.030
I suppose so.

07:28.114 --> 07:31.868
She's probably
the only one brave, or foolish, enough.

07:31.951 --> 07:36.372
[Bean] So now you come crawling back,
begging me to talk to my dad, huh?

07:36.456 --> 07:39.208
I'll do it if you come
crawling and beg me.

07:40.835 --> 07:43.963
Oh, please. Oh, please. Oh, please.

07:56.642 --> 07:58.478
Hi, Dad, I brought you some dinner.

07:58.561 --> 08:00.480
With gravy? [honks]

08:00.563 --> 08:02.482
Listen, I need to talk to you.

08:02.565 --> 08:06.819
We have to start working together.
But I need you to help me help you.

08:06.903 --> 08:08.154
[grunts]

08:09.071 --> 08:11.824
Mmm… [mumbles]

08:11.908 --> 08:14.535
Yeah, it's your favorite soup.
Melted butter.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.120
Anyway, I thought you should know

08:16.204 --> 08:18.706
that there's this thing
headed toward Dreamland.

08:18.789 --> 08:23.503
We don't know if it's an army
or a monster or a storm, or what.

08:23.586 --> 08:24.962
It's green smoke.

08:25.046 --> 08:27.757
[grunts] Green smoke? [whimpering]

08:27.840 --> 08:31.427
I know, but calm down.
We can do this together.

08:31.511 --> 08:34.138
And by we, I mean, mostly you,

08:34.222 --> 08:36.349
because, holy cow,
being in charge is stressful.

08:36.432 --> 08:38.142
I totally get why you went insane.

08:38.226 --> 08:39.894
Yeah, this isn't helping, is it?

08:39.977 --> 08:41.187
More, please.

08:41.812 --> 08:44.065
-Man, I know you know what to do.
-[moans]

08:44.148 --> 08:45.483
-Somewhere inside you…
-Mmm…

08:45.566 --> 08:48.694
…along with this food
and those chess pieces you ate yesterday,

08:48.778 --> 08:49.987
it's in there, isn't it?

08:50.613 --> 08:53.366
[grunts and mumbles]

08:53.449 --> 08:54.909
Yeah, I know what you're saying.

08:54.992 --> 08:57.203
Wait, I know what you're saying.

08:57.286 --> 09:01.249
All these years of living with a grunting,
emotionally remote dad has paid off.

09:01.332 --> 09:02.542
I have an idea.

09:02.625 --> 09:03.834
[sighs]

09:04.460 --> 09:05.503
[babbling]

09:05.586 --> 09:07.380
[honks] Idiots…

09:07.463 --> 09:09.048
[mumbling]

09:11.842 --> 09:14.220
Dummy. Dummy. [honks]

09:15.304 --> 09:17.932
Okay, um, play me in
with a little fanfare, Luci.

09:18.015 --> 09:19.600
[horn playing]

09:19.684 --> 09:22.228
All right. Shut up, everyone, quiet.

09:22.311 --> 09:25.439
The princess
has a proclamation from King Zøg.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.817
Shut up, Elfo, I'm not done yet.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.735
[playing jazz]

09:32.822 --> 09:38.369
Thank you. That was a little number
I call "Shut Up, Elfo" in E flat. Elfo?

09:38.452 --> 09:40.913
[chuckles] Okay.
That's great. Please stop clapping.

09:40.997 --> 09:43.124
That's enough. Let's stop now, please.

09:43.207 --> 09:45.793
-Oh, still one person. Let's stop.
-[Turbish clapping]

09:46.335 --> 09:48.004
-Turbish!
-[Turbish] Sorry.

09:48.087 --> 09:53.676
Ahem. Princess Tiabeanie
brings a proclamation from King Zøg.

09:53.759 --> 09:57.597
By order of my dad,
Dreamland must prepare for an attack.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.141
Furthermore, my father said, and I quote…

10:00.224 --> 10:01.183
[imitates Zøg's honk]

10:01.267 --> 10:04.895
[imitating Zøg] "Tell them jackasses
that I said to do what you say."

10:04.979 --> 10:07.189
[in normal voice]
And by "you," he means me.

10:07.273 --> 10:08.357
Continuing…

10:08.441 --> 10:12.278
[imitating Zøg] "Those idiots are so dumb,
they'll believe anything."

10:12.361 --> 10:15.197
I believe anything and I'm not an idiot.

10:15.281 --> 10:19.035
[imitating Zøg] "Once the biggest idiot
has spoken, wrap it up."

10:19.118 --> 10:21.871
-[in normal voice] Meeting adjourned.
-[all muttering]

10:23.164 --> 10:24.498
What just happened?

10:25.249 --> 10:26.959
[breathing heavily]

10:31.172 --> 10:35.009
[Dagmar echoing] Zøg? Oh, Zøg?

10:35.801 --> 10:36.844
Zøg!

10:36.927 --> 10:39.639
Dag? Dagmar, is that you?

10:39.722 --> 10:42.516
[Dagmar] Let me in,
Zøg, and I'll let you out.

10:43.267 --> 10:47.605
Whoa, I'm finally hearing
voices outside of my head.

10:48.606 --> 10:51.067
Dad, I brought you
a little midnight snack.

10:51.609 --> 10:55.488
They didn't have much in the kitchen,
but I got you some giant novelty crackers.

10:55.571 --> 10:58.783
Remember? You executed
the guy who invented these? [gasps]

10:58.866 --> 11:01.827
Oh, no! Dad? This is bad.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.497
Really bad.

11:04.580 --> 11:05.831
[honking and grunting]

11:12.296 --> 11:13.714
[yells]

11:13.798 --> 11:14.924
Who's up there?

11:15.007 --> 11:17.760
[Turbish] It's just Mertz. Only Mertz!

11:17.843 --> 11:20.763
[Mertz] It's not just me!
It's only Turbish! Ha!

11:20.846 --> 11:23.557
[Zøg] Lower the goddamn
drawbridge right now

11:23.641 --> 11:26.143
or I'll come up there
and strangle the both of you!

11:26.227 --> 11:30.731
[Turbish] Ha-ha, the only way up here
is the secret door to your immediate left!

11:30.815 --> 11:31.690
[Zøg grunts]

11:31.774 --> 11:32.983
Uh-oh.

11:33.067 --> 11:35.027
-[Zøg grunts]
-[grunting]

11:36.070 --> 11:37.530
You're next, Turbish!

11:39.240 --> 11:41.033
-[both] Ah!
-[water splashes]

11:45.788 --> 11:47.665
Hey, guys! Did you see my dad?

11:47.748 --> 11:49.125
He went thataway.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.001
Oops, I let go.

11:51.085 --> 11:52.086
[yells] No!

11:52.169 --> 11:55.965
[grunts] This place looks awful.
Who's in charge here?

11:56.048 --> 11:57.174
[honks] Who the hell is that guy?

11:57.258 --> 11:58.634
Oh!

11:58.717 --> 11:59.844
The king!

11:59.927 --> 12:01.554
What're you doin' out here?

12:01.637 --> 12:06.517
You gotta be protectin' the castle
against that green smoke that's coming.

12:06.600 --> 12:09.728
Listen, buddy,
you gotta sneak back in that castle.

12:09.812 --> 12:14.108
You can't be out here in the streets
like this… All that riffraff… [mumbling]

12:15.151 --> 12:16.444
[yells] Have you gone crazy?

12:16.527 --> 12:18.946
Dad? Dad, where are you?

12:22.158 --> 12:23.367
-[water bubbling]
-[screams]

12:23.951 --> 12:27.163
Come on in. Water's nice and warm.

12:27.246 --> 12:28.539
[screams]

12:28.622 --> 12:29.748
[honks]

12:29.832 --> 12:31.250
[all honking]

12:33.461 --> 12:34.920
[grunts]

12:35.004 --> 12:37.173
Why's everything gettin' dinkier?

12:37.256 --> 12:38.966
[Shocko vocalizing] Ooh!

12:40.050 --> 12:41.177
Ooh!

12:41.260 --> 12:42.428
[honks]

12:42.511 --> 12:43.846
-Ooh!
-[honks]

12:43.929 --> 12:45.181
-Ooh!
-[honks]

12:45.264 --> 12:46.182
-Ooh!
-[honks]

12:46.265 --> 12:47.600
[both continue]

12:51.520 --> 12:52.938
All right, I'll talk to you later.

12:53.022 --> 12:53.981
Ooh.

12:54.565 --> 12:55.774
[water bubbling and splashing]

12:55.858 --> 12:57.401
-Hey, girlie!
-Yow!

12:57.485 --> 13:00.112
Now with bubbles! 14 cents!

13:00.196 --> 13:01.280
Forget it.

13:04.408 --> 13:06.035
Have you ever sold a cup?

13:06.577 --> 13:08.287
13 cents!

13:10.539 --> 13:12.124
[shower running]

13:12.208 --> 13:13.709
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

13:13.792 --> 13:14.627
Thanks!

13:16.879 --> 13:18.172
Oh, sorry!

13:22.635 --> 13:24.470
[grunting]

13:25.262 --> 13:27.640
Oh, no, he's at Losers' Leap,

13:27.723 --> 13:29.391
right above Splatter Beach.

13:37.149 --> 13:40.152
Hi, Dad. Please don't run away.

13:40.236 --> 13:43.405
Come on, what's wrong? Talk to me.

13:44.156 --> 13:46.033
Now you're not talking at all?

13:46.116 --> 13:47.993
Not even a honk, for old time's sake?

13:48.536 --> 13:49.370
[honks]

13:50.120 --> 13:52.373
All right. Come on,
we can go get some crackers?

13:52.915 --> 13:55.918
Dad, come on, say something.

13:58.128 --> 14:03.801
Let's go home. The kingdom needs you.
I need you. I mostly need you to talk.

14:07.388 --> 14:09.139
[ominous music playing]

14:11.141 --> 14:12.560
[sentimental music playing]

14:14.979 --> 14:18.691
You know, Dad, a lot of people
think you're beyond repair.

14:18.774 --> 14:21.193
And now you're wearing
your crown backwards,

14:21.277 --> 14:23.654
and your ass hanging out
is a definite deal breaker.

14:23.737 --> 14:25.990
But I know that you can get better.

14:26.073 --> 14:27.491
And I'll be right by your side

14:27.575 --> 14:28.784
-until you do.
-[door closes]

14:28.868 --> 14:30.619
Damn it! Dad!

14:30.703 --> 14:31.912
[sighs]

14:32.580 --> 14:35.082
[Zøg as Freckles] Hi, Beanie! Over here!

14:35.165 --> 14:37.167
Come on, Beanie, over here!

14:37.251 --> 14:38.794
Wow, okay.

14:40.045 --> 14:42.673
Hello, there!
You sound like someone I know.

14:42.756 --> 14:46.510
I don't think so.
I ain't never been tossed in a drunk tank.

14:46.594 --> 14:47.511
[laughs]

14:47.595 --> 14:48.470
Hey!

14:48.554 --> 14:50.848
I'm kiddin'.
You look like you can take a joke.

14:50.931 --> 14:53.934
You look in the mirror
every mornin', don't you? [laughs]

14:54.018 --> 14:57.396
Dad, you're talking again!
Let's go home and celebrate!

14:58.063 --> 14:59.106
[honks]

15:00.107 --> 15:04.194
Don't you see?
He talks through me. But it ain't free.

15:04.278 --> 15:05.404
Tee hee hee.

15:05.487 --> 15:08.657
Oh, I can't part with that one.
That's Freckles.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.327
He's a very naughty boy,
but he's my favorite.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.370
He's practically my son, you know,

15:13.454 --> 15:15.831
though I wouldn't want to nurse
that splintery wooden mouth!

15:15.915 --> 15:17.416
He's a biter. [chuckles]

15:17.499 --> 15:21.045
Perhaps you'd be interested
in this eyeless frog dummy?

15:21.128 --> 15:23.422
He comes with a lily pad arse glove.

15:23.505 --> 15:24.381
[honks]

15:24.465 --> 15:26.842
I think the insulting dummy
really appeals to him.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.344
And my low self-esteem.

15:28.427 --> 15:31.805
Aw, I'm done razzin' ya,
ya bucktoothed gin junkie.

15:31.889 --> 15:33.641
We'll take it in a bag, please.

15:37.227 --> 15:39.939
Any operating instructions
or ominous warnings?

15:40.022 --> 15:43.150
Oh, my, no. Enjoy! No refunds!

15:46.195 --> 15:48.155
-Bye, Freckles!
-Hmm.

15:53.702 --> 15:55.871
[joints creaking]

15:55.955 --> 15:56.872
[Freckles whistles]

15:56.956 --> 16:01.627
I've heard every man's home
is his castle, but this place is a dump.

16:01.710 --> 16:04.713
Yeah, well, the throne room
isn't usually such a disaster,

16:04.797 --> 16:08.008
but my dad has had
kind of a rough few years.

16:08.092 --> 16:11.971
And Bunty only cleans on Tuesdays.
Being king can drive you mad.

16:12.054 --> 16:14.056
Uh, you can say that again!

16:14.139 --> 16:16.058
And the way Zøg was tortured,

16:16.141 --> 16:19.144
it's no wonder
he don't talk no more, yeah?

16:19.228 --> 16:21.730
It's "doesn't talk no more."

16:21.814 --> 16:23.816
Wait, tortured? How?

16:23.899 --> 16:27.111
Zøg was left for dead
with a hole in his chest.

16:27.194 --> 16:30.280
He was told his loving daughter
was burnt at the stake.

16:30.364 --> 16:34.243
He was buried alive in a pine box.
That's torture!

16:34.326 --> 16:37.496
I should know.
Some of my best friends are pine boxes.

16:37.579 --> 16:38.497
[laughs]

16:38.580 --> 16:41.083
Princess, the king
has escaped from the mental ward

16:41.166 --> 16:42.334
and now, that nutjob is…

16:42.418 --> 16:46.171
sitting there with a charming
little puppet on his lap. [chuckles]

16:46.255 --> 16:48.924
[whispers] Is it wise to have Zøg
untethered like that?

16:49.008 --> 16:49.842
[whispers] He's good.

16:49.925 --> 16:52.886
This dummy keeps him calm
and allows him to express himself

16:52.970 --> 16:55.347
in ways
that don't involve honking or punching.

16:55.431 --> 16:59.560
Oh, I see this castle already
has a dummy. Am I right, dummy?

16:59.643 --> 17:02.688
[chuckles] Good one, Your Majesty.
[clears throat]

17:02.771 --> 17:05.816
-The kingdom needs--
-You think ignoring me makes me go away,

17:05.899 --> 17:08.485
but it just…
[yells] makes me more annoying!

17:08.569 --> 17:10.279
Consider me schooled.

17:10.362 --> 17:11.822
The kingdom needs to prepare

17:11.905 --> 17:14.867
for an incoming cloud
of green smoke and we have a question.

17:14.950 --> 17:17.786
Oh? Which is?

17:17.870 --> 17:21.498
What do we do to prepare
for an incoming cloud of green smoke?

17:21.582 --> 17:22.541
Hmm…

17:22.624 --> 17:26.962
You wanna know the most important
thing in preparing for a potential attack?

17:27.046 --> 17:28.130
Oh, yes.

17:28.213 --> 17:30.632
-Come closer.
-Okay.

17:30.716 --> 17:31.842
Closer.

17:31.925 --> 17:32.801
Oh?

17:32.885 --> 17:34.803
-Closer.
-Hmm?

17:34.887 --> 17:37.639
[whispers] See,
you gotta watch out for my hand!

17:37.723 --> 17:39.099
-Ow!
-[laughs]

17:39.183 --> 17:40.601
Look at it! It left an imprint!

17:40.684 --> 17:43.520
Uh, I think he means
we have to be vigilant.

17:46.565 --> 17:48.942
[Bean] That big wall
is not gonna stop the smoke.

17:49.026 --> 17:50.736
Get the nets, idiots!

17:51.612 --> 17:55.199
[Freckles] Hey, watch it.
That ladder's my uncle.

17:55.282 --> 17:59.828
Even more important
than a good defense is a good offense.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.371
You heard him. We need weapons.

18:01.455 --> 18:03.707
We need bravery.
We need a brilliant strategy.

18:03.791 --> 18:05.959
-Is hiding a weapon?
-No.

18:06.043 --> 18:08.253
-Is hiding bravery?
-No.

18:08.337 --> 18:10.506
Is hiding a brilliant strategy?

18:10.589 --> 18:12.007
Well, yes.

18:15.594 --> 18:18.097
Sergeant Touchy,
feel out where we're vulnerable.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.264
Hmm…

18:19.348 --> 18:20.599
Yes, yes…

18:20.682 --> 18:24.228
You're afraid to let people in
and you hide behind sarcasm.

18:24.311 --> 18:27.022
I meant our battle plan, but good to know.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.191
Jenkins, work on your issues.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.654
There's one last thing
you gotta do to be ready.

18:33.737 --> 18:34.780
And that is?

18:34.863 --> 18:38.075
You have to come closer
'cause I don't want people to panic.

18:38.158 --> 18:39.993
-Yes?
-Come closer!

18:40.077 --> 18:44.581
Oh, no, I'm not falling for that
one again. You're going to hit me.

18:44.665 --> 18:46.708
I'm not gonna hit you, I promise!

18:46.792 --> 18:48.043
-You promise?
-Yeah!

18:48.127 --> 18:49.253
-You really do?
-Uh-huh.

18:49.336 --> 18:51.547
No foolin' now,
this is a serious situation.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.632
-You got it.
-All right, then.

18:53.715 --> 18:56.468
-You gotta come closer, though.
-All right.

18:57.094 --> 18:59.054
-Closer.
-Hmm.

18:59.138 --> 19:02.015
You really wanna know
what's important in a siege?

19:02.099 --> 19:03.600
Yes, I do.

19:03.684 --> 19:05.018
Closer, then.

19:05.102 --> 19:08.313
You gotta make sure
people don't go hungry! [grunts]

19:08.397 --> 19:09.523
Ow!

19:09.606 --> 19:11.650
Oh, ow! Ow! Ow!

19:11.733 --> 19:12.609
[crying]

19:12.693 --> 19:14.403
Oh, you promised!

19:14.486 --> 19:16.446
Yeah, I promised I wasn't gonna hit ya.

19:16.530 --> 19:19.950
That's why I bit ya.
Next time, I might slit ya. Yeah.

19:20.033 --> 19:22.327
We better stock up on food and beverages.

19:26.999 --> 19:30.210
We've brought regular gumballs,
and suicide gumballs,

19:30.294 --> 19:32.671
in case things take a turn for the worse.

19:32.754 --> 19:34.590
Okay, put it over there.

19:39.511 --> 19:40.721
Hmm…

19:42.472 --> 19:43.599
[choking]

19:44.766 --> 19:46.101
Ew, grape.

19:46.852 --> 19:47.936
Ew, no, thank you.

19:49.104 --> 19:52.983
Preparations seem to be proceeding
beyond our wildest fantasies, sire.

19:53.066 --> 19:55.235
And you oughta see this guy's fantasies!

19:55.319 --> 19:57.863
Talk about being sick and depraved!

19:57.946 --> 20:01.408
That's all he does!
Talk about being sick and depraved.

20:01.491 --> 20:04.453
Are you finished?
Because we're due to be slaughtered.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.790
We're working well together
getting the kingdom prepared.

20:08.874 --> 20:12.252
I feel really optimistic
about the oncoming bloodbath.

20:12.336 --> 20:13.712
[snoring]

20:13.795 --> 20:14.713
Good night, Dad.

20:17.466 --> 20:18.884
[Freckles] Good night, Bean.

20:19.509 --> 20:21.011
[Zøg snoring]

20:22.346 --> 20:25.015
From now on, call me Freckles.

20:25.098 --> 20:27.017
So…

20:27.100 --> 20:30.103
this isn't gonna get more normal
any time soon, is it?

20:30.187 --> 20:31.647
What do you think?

20:31.730 --> 20:32.898
[laughs]

20:49.164 --> 20:50.707
All right, rummies.

20:50.791 --> 20:55.003
You don't have to die at home,
but you can't die here. Now beat it!

20:55.087 --> 20:56.421
[all groaning]

20:58.590 --> 21:02.844
Hey, do you guys think I should wean
my dad off his emotional support dummy?

21:02.928 --> 21:05.264
And if I do,
will he still be able to run the kingdom?

21:05.347 --> 21:07.557
Face it.
You're the one running the kingdom.

21:07.641 --> 21:11.687
All that dummy does is tell stale,
wooden jokes that hurt people's feelings.

21:11.770 --> 21:14.022
Bean, you're the one in charge.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.899
-Quiet, mule. Hyah!
-Ah!

21:17.150 --> 21:20.737
Hmm, there's only one way
to find out who's really in control.

21:20.821 --> 21:22.781
[suspenseful violin music playing]

21:27.494 --> 21:29.079
[Zøg snoring]

21:40.257 --> 21:42.092
[Bean] Sweet dreams, Freckles.

21:44.344 --> 21:45.554
[crickets chirping]

21:46.930 --> 21:48.098
[sighs]

21:51.184 --> 21:52.853
[door creaks]

21:54.521 --> 21:55.939
[clanking]

21:56.023 --> 21:58.025
Whoa! [breathing heavily]

21:58.108 --> 21:59.776
-[door slams]
-Huh.

22:03.071 --> 22:04.031
Whoa!

22:12.789 --> 22:14.291
Oh. [sighs]

22:18.253 --> 22:21.006
Dad, it's 3:00 a.m.
and you're not in your bed.

22:21.089 --> 22:22.257
Or in the kitchen.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.843
-Were you in my bedroom just now?
-[gasps]

22:25.552 --> 22:27.679
Dad, what'd you do with Freckles?

22:27.763 --> 22:30.724
Hello, Bean. Did you miss me?

22:30.807 --> 22:31.683
Whoa!

22:31.767 --> 22:33.268
Dad, this ain't good.

22:33.351 --> 22:36.063
But if you could just keep trying,
I know you can get better.

22:36.146 --> 22:38.857
That's not possible. I mean, look at me.

22:39.483 --> 22:41.359
No, look at me.

22:42.152 --> 22:44.321
I'm just a flabby husk of a man.

22:44.404 --> 22:46.948
I can't barely honk no more.

22:47.032 --> 22:51.328
[honks faintly] See? I would've loved
to be the hero of the story,

22:51.411 --> 22:55.665
but now, I can't even hold a spoon.
I'm afraid of 'em now.

22:55.749 --> 22:59.586
Remember when I gave myself
all them genius awards?

22:59.669 --> 23:02.422
I'm glad those awards
ain't around to see this.

23:03.256 --> 23:06.176
Even you know I'm already gone, Beanie.

23:06.259 --> 23:09.471
You can't be gone, Dad. I need you. Here.

23:09.554 --> 23:13.475
And I need you.
Here! You can do this, Beanie.

23:13.558 --> 23:16.937
Do what?
Dad, no, please don't ask me this.

23:17.020 --> 23:21.608
If I don't go away now,
I may never be able to come back.

23:21.691 --> 23:23.401
But who will take care of the kingdom?

23:23.485 --> 23:26.071
Dad, I can't… I can't do it on my own.

23:26.154 --> 23:29.074
Oh, Beanie, you already are.

23:29.157 --> 23:31.743
You've been doin' it this whole time.

23:34.663 --> 23:36.915
Thanks for being my dad, okay?

23:36.998 --> 23:39.167
I've had a lot of people
leave me in my life,

23:39.251 --> 23:42.546
but I've never ever ever
not had you before.

23:42.629 --> 23:46.174
Your stupid, rude,
yelling face was always there.

23:46.258 --> 23:47.717
So come back, okay?

23:48.301 --> 23:50.554
Be a good queenie, Beanie.

23:50.637 --> 23:53.557
For me. And for me.

23:54.057 --> 23:55.934
[Odval] And for the kingdom.

23:56.017 --> 23:57.811
What say you, Princess?

23:59.563 --> 24:01.815
My dad needs to go away for a while.

24:10.365 --> 24:12.117
[donkey braying]

24:12.742 --> 24:14.202
It's time to go, Dad.

24:23.879 --> 24:25.046
[sad music playing]

24:52.282 --> 24:53.283
[sighs in contentment]

24:54.534 --> 24:57.287
-Ah!
-Hi, I'm Chazzzzz.

24:57.370 --> 25:01.708
I'll be your donkey cart driver
and tour guide for the next 23 hours.

25:01.791 --> 25:04.377
I warn you,
the ride may get a little bumpy.

25:04.461 --> 25:09.466
For your own safety, keep your arms
and legs inside the wagon at all times.

25:09.549 --> 25:10.967
I have a machete.

25:11.051 --> 25:12.552
Ah!

25:12.636 --> 25:16.056
[honking and babbling]

25:22.062 --> 25:23.980
[all] Our Queen.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.777
[closing theme music playing]
