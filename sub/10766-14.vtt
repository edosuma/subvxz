WEBVTT

00:06.184 --> 00:09.449
Okay, here we go.
Put down your money, find the honey.

00:09.521 --> 00:12.979
Locate the black queen,
and I don't mean Little Richard.

00:13.859 --> 00:15.019
There!

00:20.065 --> 00:23.262
Okay, Carlton,
you're pretty good for a white guy.

00:24.469 --> 00:27.905
- What's going on out here?
- I'm cleaning up, Geoffrey.

00:28.073 --> 00:30.906
I hope they pay you
more than they pay me.

00:31.944 --> 00:35.004
Seriously, Geoffrey,
you should get in on this.

00:35.948 --> 00:39.748
Do you play the Hell's Kitchen version
or the A-train hybrid.

00:42.754 --> 00:45.848
- I'm in.
- All right, here we go.

00:47.326 --> 00:51.524
Zagnut, Goobers, Good & Plenty,
locate the black girl, you win $20.

00:54.766 --> 00:56.063
That one.

00:57.836 --> 00:59.030
Y es!

01:00.439 --> 01:02.964
Well, there goes Saturday night at Sizzler.

01:04.443 --> 01:06.172
I had coupons, too.

01:07.779 --> 01:10.145
Beginner's luck, Master William.

01:10.749 --> 01:13.547
- One last bet?
- No, no, thanks. I'm out, G.

01:14.386 --> 01:17.014
Didn't realize you were such a coward.

01:21.026 --> 01:22.254
Chicken.

01:24.296 --> 01:27.094
All right, don't nobody call me a coward.

01:27.799 --> 01:30.290
- What's your bet?
- $50.

01:31.870 --> 01:35.362
I ain't no punk, I'll take that down.
Here we go.

01:41.213 --> 01:42.680
I can't look.

01:47.386 --> 01:50.878
- Drat!
- Damn. Oh, damn, G.

01:51.556 --> 01:53.615
Damn! There, see, that one red.

01:53.692 --> 01:57.219
See, if it was like you, you'd have won,
but it red, so you lost.

01:57.295 --> 01:59.160
Better luck next time.

01:59.231 --> 02:02.325
He fell for it, Will. Now let's go hustle Dad.

02:05.537 --> 02:07.402
- Oops.
- "Oops"?

02:07.472 --> 02:10.270
Good cover.
I'm guessing you've done this before?

02:12.000 --> 02:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:24.182 --> 03:28.278
Y ou're wasting your time, Carlton.
Geoffrey already cut out all the bra ads.

03:29.054 --> 03:31.682
Will, for your information,
I was looking at those...

03:31.757 --> 03:33.918
funny little markings
underneath the pictures.

03:33.992 --> 03:35.983
In Bel-Air we call them "words."

03:38.897 --> 03:41.730
Guess what,
I just finished my first short story.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.562
What a coincidence, your first short story
and your first short son in the same room.

03:47.506 --> 03:49.736
My friend at <i>Essence</i> magazine
offered to read it.

03:49.808 --> 03:52.174
But, before she does,
I wanted to give you a copy...

03:52.244 --> 03:54.838
and I want you to tell me
exactly what you think.

03:54.913 --> 03:56.574
Great, I can't wait to read it.

03:56.648 --> 03:58.843
Well, now that I am a professional...

03:58.917 --> 04:01.249
I'm gonna go check out
that new word processor.

04:01.319 --> 04:03.753
- See you.
- That's my little writer.

04:07.325 --> 04:09.350
Okay, somebody bury this.

04:09.895 --> 04:11.123
Dad, are you crazy?

04:11.196 --> 04:14.131
If I read this story,
it'll be the biggest mistake I've ever made.

04:14.199 --> 04:15.894
I don't know about that, Uncle Phil.

04:15.967 --> 04:18.697
Remember them plaid shorts
you wore last summer?

04:21.740 --> 04:24.903
Look, let me tell you boys something
about women.

04:25.143 --> 04:27.111
Now, if I read it and say I like it...

04:27.179 --> 04:29.409
she'll think
I'm just trying to make her happy.

04:29.481 --> 04:33.315
If I say I don't like it,
she'll stop trying to make me happy.

04:36.154 --> 04:39.851
Y es, women is a trip, Uncle Phil.
It's just like, let's say...

04:39.925 --> 04:41.984
you accidentally scream out
the wrong name...

04:42.060 --> 04:45.791
and they jumping all out
the back of your car like that.

04:47.699 --> 04:49.530
So, what are you going to do, Dad?

04:49.601 --> 04:52.399
- Well, hey, I'm the man of the house.
- Y eah.

04:52.470 --> 04:55.598
- What do you think I'm gonna do?
- What a man would do.

04:55.674 --> 04:58.472
Buy her a car
and hope she forgets all about this.

04:59.411 --> 05:02.608
Y ou know, we can really learn a lot
from that man.

05:03.748 --> 05:07.206
- Hey, G, would you make me a sandwich?
- But, of course.

05:13.191 --> 05:15.056
Now you're a sandwich.

05:18.363 --> 05:20.627
Y ou can take it off your head.

05:21.933 --> 05:25.232
- G, something wrong?
- Y ou swindled me.

05:25.871 --> 05:28.396
I was planning to use that money
on lottery tickets.

05:28.473 --> 05:31.499
The jackpot's up to $26,000,000.

05:31.743 --> 05:32.801
Wow!

05:33.178 --> 05:36.113
Could you imagine what life would be like
with all that money?

05:36.181 --> 05:39.207
Buying whatever you want,
driving fancy cars...

05:39.284 --> 05:41.411
dining in fancy restaurants.

05:43.154 --> 05:45.952
Wait a second, that is what life is like.

05:46.691 --> 05:50.252
I see this is getting me nowhere.
Now, if you'll excuse me...

05:50.328 --> 05:53.229
I'm going to enjoy
the one thing you can't spoil for me.

05:53.298 --> 05:56.461
I don't know, Will. I mean,
Geoffrey works hard for his money.

05:56.534 --> 05:58.502
- Y eah.
- Y ou know, we have so much...

05:58.570 --> 06:00.401
and he has so little.

06:01.840 --> 06:04.240
- Well, now we'll have more.
- Y eah, absolutely.

06:04.309 --> 06:06.300
<i>Let's p/ay</i> Brainstorm.

06:06.378 --> 06:09.176
<i>Fe/ix, /'// take Famous Quotes for $100.</i>

06:09.281 --> 06:13.115
<i>The question is, "What is the motto</i>
<i>of The Three Musketeers?"</i>

06:13.184 --> 06:17.177
That's an easy one. "Creamy on the inside,
smooth on the outside."

06:18.089 --> 06:21.115
- <i>"A// for one and one for a//!"</i>
- <i>Right again.</i>

06:22.260 --> 06:24.057
I can't believe you missed that one, G.

06:24.129 --> 06:25.756
Y eah, even Will could have
guessed that one...

06:25.830 --> 06:28.355
and the only thing he reads
is the cereal box.

06:29.100 --> 06:31.728
Y eah, well, at least I don't fit in one.

06:33.805 --> 06:38.037
Well, if you're so confident
in my lack of ability...

06:38.376 --> 06:40.776
perhaps you'd like to make a little wager.

06:40.845 --> 06:44.042
- Say, $30?
- Done.

06:44.582 --> 06:46.573
<i>Vietnam for $200.</i>

06:47.852 --> 06:49.752
<i>You drew the wi/d card.</i>

06:51.222 --> 06:54.555
What do you say, Geoffrey?
Want to double your bet?

06:55.794 --> 06:58.228
Well, it is an awful lot of money...

06:58.296 --> 07:00.958
but, what the hell.

07:01.333 --> 07:02.800
<i>And the question is.'</i>

07:02.867 --> 07:07.429
<i>"Who is the South Vietnamese president</i>
<i>ki//ed by his own genera/s in 1963?"</i>

07:10.408 --> 07:12.342
Ngo Dinh Diem.

07:14.179 --> 07:18.741
<i>No guesses?</i>
<i>The correct answer is Ngo Dinh Diem.</i>

07:22.721 --> 07:23.983
Splendid.

07:28.793 --> 07:30.818
I say we call Immigration.

07:31.262 --> 07:33.355
Is this <i>Brainstorm?</i>

07:33.431 --> 07:36.332
How sad.
Some people will do anything for money.

07:36.401 --> 07:38.995
I mean,
why don't they just ask their fathers?

07:39.170 --> 07:41.638
<i>The category is Greek History.</i>

07:41.840 --> 07:44.400
<i>And the fina/</i> Brainstorm <i>question is.'</i>

07:44.676 --> 07:48.703
<i>"What Bronze Age civi/ization emerged</i>
<i>about 2500 BC?"</i>

07:48.780 --> 07:51.248
Oh, I know, the Minoan civilization.

07:52.283 --> 07:54.911
- <i>The Minoan civi/ization?</i>
- <i>Correct.</i>

07:57.922 --> 07:59.890
Hold up, hold up. Time out.

07:59.958 --> 08:02.256
Flag on the plate, traveling,
offsides, clipping.

08:02.327 --> 08:04.227
Hold up, wait a minute.

08:05.463 --> 08:08.364
- What's up with this here?
- Hilary, how'd you know that?

08:08.433 --> 08:11.231
<i>E</i> asy, Geoffrey's been watching
that tape all day.

08:17.275 --> 08:20.176
Well, I'm off to the store.

08:20.311 --> 08:23.075
When you're through,
do turn off the VCR...

08:23.148 --> 08:26.174
and return that tape of <i>Brainstorm</i>
to my room.

08:27.652 --> 08:30.553
And might I add, ha ha!

08:30.922 --> 08:32.787
And, ha!

08:58.149 --> 09:00.344
- Carlton, come on, come on.
- Okay, okay.

09:01.953 --> 09:04.183
I wonder what Geoffrey uses that cape for.

09:04.255 --> 09:05.722
Just...

09:07.725 --> 09:09.818
Give me the lottery ticket.

09:09.894 --> 09:11.919
All right, watch the door.

09:18.536 --> 09:22.472
- Are you sure we should do this?
- Look, come on, man. He got our money.

09:22.540 --> 09:26.101
I mean, it's either this
or force him to listen to y oko Ono albums.

09:33.051 --> 09:37.283
Boys, your mother is driving me crazy
about reading that short story.

09:37.956 --> 09:40.390
Gee, Dad, why don't you just read it
and get it over with?

09:40.458 --> 09:44.827
I did read it. Trust me, the only thing
your mother should write is checks.

09:45.530 --> 09:49.694
So, if she asks where I am,
you haven't seen me and I'm not at home.

09:50.034 --> 09:51.763
- But, Uncle Phil...
- No "buts," Will.

09:51.836 --> 09:55.135
No matter what she says,
you haven't seen hide nor hair of me.

09:55.206 --> 09:57.902
Hi, sweetheart.
How long have you been there?

09:58.009 --> 10:00.409
Y ou read it. Y ou read it and you hated it.

10:00.478 --> 10:03.572
No, I lost it. Y eah, yeah, that's it.

10:03.648 --> 10:06.082
And I was so looking forward to reading it.

10:06.151 --> 10:08.984
Oh, well, that's okay 'cause, you know,
I made an extra copy. Here.

10:09.053 --> 10:12.045
- And I want you to be honest.
- I will.

10:13.491 --> 10:17.188
Oh, check it out.
The lottery numbers are coming on!

10:17.328 --> 10:18.920
Turn it up. Turn it up.

10:19.964 --> 10:23.400
Why, Geoffrey, do you have a ticket
in today's drawing?

10:24.802 --> 10:27.362
<i>And this week's SuperLotto numbers are.'</i>

10:27.572 --> 10:30.370
<i>Sixteen. Twenty-two.</i>

10:31.376 --> 10:33.071
- <i>Three.</i>
- Oh, my!

10:33.144 --> 10:35.704
- <i>Forty-one.</i>
- Y es! Y es!

10:35.880 --> 10:38.314
- <i>Twe/ve.</i>
- Y es! Please, God.

10:38.383 --> 10:39.748
Fifteen. Fifteen, please.

10:39.817 --> 10:43.344
<i>And the /ast number</i>
<i>for the $26,000,000 jackpot...</i>

10:43.588 --> 10:44.850
<i>fifteen!</i>

10:48.493 --> 10:50.791
I'm rich! I'm rich!

10:53.131 --> 10:54.962
Did someone say "rich"?

10:59.771 --> 11:02.706
Hey! I don't care how much money
you got, brother, you ain't gonna...

11:02.774 --> 11:03.900
What's going on in here?

11:03.975 --> 11:07.274
And don't tell me I'm too young to know
because I'm sick of it.

11:07.345 --> 11:10.746
My friends, this calls for a drink.

11:10.982 --> 11:13.507
- This is incredible.
- I'll say.

11:17.655 --> 11:21.113
Geoffrey. Geoffrey, now,
that's a $500 bottle of champagne.

11:22.160 --> 11:25.095
Ah, the cheap stuff. Not to worry, Phil.

11:26.598 --> 11:27.997
It's on me.

11:29.701 --> 11:31.999
Geoffrey, check it out. Me and Carlton...

11:32.070 --> 11:34.436
y our Montrose vase...

11:34.505 --> 11:38.236
attracts dust like a magnet.

11:38.309 --> 11:39.674
G, listen...

11:41.145 --> 11:42.669
Problem solved.

11:43.281 --> 11:45.806
- Okay, G, listen, listen.
- Philip...

11:46.484 --> 11:49.681
I have $1,000 with your name on it.

11:49.887 --> 11:53.550
Do the family a favor,
get Viv some cooking lessons.

11:53.625 --> 11:55.183
Y ou...

11:55.893 --> 11:59.624
And, Miss Ashley,
how does a Mercedes sound?

11:59.998 --> 12:01.192
Vroom, vroom?

12:01.499 --> 12:03.490
Very clever, I'll get you two.

12:05.036 --> 12:06.799
Vroom, vroom, vroom.

12:08.740 --> 12:10.230
Nice try.

12:12.477 --> 12:14.843
In case you hadn't figured it out...

12:15.947 --> 12:17.073
I quit.

12:17.915 --> 12:18.904
I quit.

12:32.263 --> 12:35.232
Will, Mom and Dad are gonna kill us
when they find out what we did.

12:35.300 --> 12:37.894
No, they're not, 'cause
they're not gonna find out what we did.

12:37.969 --> 12:40.938
Geoffrey's not leaving
because I'm going to do the right thing.

12:41.005 --> 12:44.634
- What, tell the truth?
- No, I'm gonna beg like Keith Sweat.

12:52.817 --> 12:54.444
Money.

13:00.091 --> 13:01.319
Money.

13:06.331 --> 13:08.094
Will, do something.

13:17.141 --> 13:18.267
Will!

13:23.414 --> 13:25.041
Y ou can keep the tape.

13:25.116 --> 13:26.879
I'm buying the O'Jays.

13:28.286 --> 13:29.913
Look, G...

13:31.389 --> 13:34.790
we've known each other,
you know, a long time, right?

13:35.593 --> 13:37.117
We certainly have.

13:38.463 --> 13:40.260
My God!

13:40.631 --> 13:42.155
All these years.

13:42.967 --> 13:45.162
All these memories.

13:47.438 --> 13:49.338
How do you say goodbye?

13:51.275 --> 13:53.903
Like this: "Goodbye."

13:54.912 --> 13:56.004
Goodbye.

13:57.582 --> 13:59.743
Geoffrey, you remember
when you came to us...

13:59.817 --> 14:02.285
and you had no money and nowhere to go?

14:04.188 --> 14:05.416
Y es!

14:06.557 --> 14:08.855
Well, some things never change.

14:09.227 --> 14:11.127
Am I missing something?

14:12.463 --> 14:14.988
Y eah, about $26,000,000.

14:17.335 --> 14:18.768
Will did it.

14:20.004 --> 14:21.528
Did what?

14:24.375 --> 14:27.208
We tricked you into thinking you won, G.

14:27.478 --> 14:31.505
What you just watched was a tape
of last week's lottery numbers.

14:37.955 --> 14:39.320
How clever.

14:41.225 --> 14:44.251
Y ou used my own ruse against me.

14:45.296 --> 14:47.127
How I admire you.

14:47.799 --> 14:48.857
Die!

14:50.802 --> 14:52.963
Geoffrey, you're killing him.

14:53.037 --> 14:55.562
Y ou catch on quickly, you little twit.

14:55.640 --> 14:59.076
G, listen, I said we're sorry.

15:01.045 --> 15:03.275
I'm sorry. I must not have heard you.

15:04.449 --> 15:07.816
I'm fine. I'm okay. I'm okay.

15:18.663 --> 15:20.255
Look, G.

15:21.365 --> 15:23.526
It's going to be all right, man.

15:23.601 --> 15:25.967
Uncle Phil will give you your job back.

15:26.771 --> 15:28.830
What about the money?

15:30.408 --> 15:31.773
There is no money.

15:37.315 --> 15:38.577
I see.

15:41.519 --> 15:44.113
I have no choice but to leave.

15:46.924 --> 15:49.119
I made such a fool of myself.

15:51.028 --> 15:54.088
I shudder to think
what I said to your parents.

15:57.468 --> 15:59.698
It's all right, G. Come on, man.

16:01.172 --> 16:03.265
I'm too humiliated to stay.

16:04.442 --> 16:08.378
- But, Geoffrey. Geoffrey, you can't go.
- Come on, G. It was a joke, man.

16:10.348 --> 16:12.282
Will, what are we gonna do?

16:14.352 --> 16:18.584
Look, I don't know about you, man,
but I'm going to take this TV right here.

16:20.258 --> 16:23.318
Hey, grab that radio,
drop it off in my room for me.

16:27.031 --> 16:28.521
Y ou did what?

16:28.699 --> 16:31.532
Are you out of your horny,
little adolescent minds?

16:32.670 --> 16:34.331
I know I am, Dad.

16:36.674 --> 16:39.575
What you did was not only humiliating...

16:39.644 --> 16:42.169
it caused Geoffrey to quit his job.

16:42.446 --> 16:44.744
Look, Uncle Phil, it was just a joke.

16:44.815 --> 16:46.783
A joke I had nothing to do with, Dad.

16:46.851 --> 16:49.979
I mean, you know me,
I don't even have a sense of humor.

16:52.290 --> 16:55.088
Y ou two have pulled some pranks
in your day...

16:55.393 --> 16:58.260
but this one, this one takes the cake.

17:08.271 --> 17:09.829
He's about to blow, man.

17:09.906 --> 17:12.637
Make a break for the front door.
I'll cover you.

17:13.010 --> 17:14.443
- So.
- So.

17:15.880 --> 17:19.611
Tell me, if you were me,
what would you do?

17:21.953 --> 17:25.513
I don't know, forget the whole thing
and get us a couple Jet Skis.

17:25.589 --> 17:27.079
I like that.

17:28.092 --> 17:30.424
Look, you big-eared freeloader...

17:30.494 --> 17:32.519
you take the little,
square-headed cousin, here...

17:32.597 --> 17:34.588
and you find Geoffrey
and you bring him back...

17:34.665 --> 17:36.360
or they'll never find your bodies.

17:36.434 --> 17:39.130
And, I'm a judge. I can make it happen.

17:46.110 --> 17:50.274
Y ou know, really, I don't mind the yelling.
But does he have to spit?

18:03.894 --> 18:07.455
This happens all the time.
They think I'm Bryant Gumbel.

18:11.202 --> 18:13.432
Are you the guy from <i>Webster?</i>

18:20.144 --> 18:21.202
No.

18:22.346 --> 18:25.543
I told you it was the guy
from <i>Diff'rent Strokes.</i>

18:27.151 --> 18:29.483
So, Bryant, are you sure
this the restaurant...

18:29.553 --> 18:31.316
Hilary said G was working at?

18:32.189 --> 18:35.352
- What are you two nimrods doing here?
- I'm pretty sure.

18:35.893 --> 18:39.021
Look, G. Come on, man,
we want you to come home with us.

18:39.096 --> 18:40.996
I'm afraid that's impossible.

18:41.065 --> 18:43.465
All right, G, we made a mistake, okay.

18:43.534 --> 18:46.503
What, are you going to
hold a grudge forever?

18:46.871 --> 18:48.805
How about until I'm dead?

18:49.173 --> 18:52.267
Geoffrey, you can't let something like this
come between us.

18:52.343 --> 18:54.538
Look, I want you to leave.

18:55.012 --> 18:58.675
I finally found a position
where I'm respected and appreciated.

18:58.749 --> 19:02.185
Geoffrey, the urinals need mints. Move it.

19:05.189 --> 19:07.783
Inside joke. Y ou wouldn't understand.

19:09.960 --> 19:13.760
- Look, I don't think it's going to work, Will.
- Keep hope alive.

19:18.002 --> 19:19.264
Hey, my man!

19:19.336 --> 19:22.271
Look, check it out, me and my partner,
here, we need a table...

19:22.339 --> 19:24.204
preferably by the window. Now.

19:24.275 --> 19:25.902
Who are you?

19:26.110 --> 19:30.410
Who am I? Y ou hear... Who am I?
I'm a black man with a short fuse.

19:32.349 --> 19:34.749
Geoffrey, show them to the table.

19:36.520 --> 19:38.420
Show us to the table.

19:40.891 --> 19:44.327
- <i>E</i> at fast and get out.
- We're not leaving without you.

19:45.362 --> 19:48.058
Look, G, come on, everybody misses you.

19:48.666 --> 19:51.931
Well, get used to it. I can't go back.

19:52.403 --> 19:55.930
- Y ou humiliated me.
- Geoffrey, we've all been humiliated.

19:56.006 --> 19:59.965
Y eah, how do you think Carlton feels
when he changes into his gym shorts?

20:01.479 --> 20:03.845
That's a very small humiliation.

20:04.882 --> 20:06.782
Hey, what's that supposed to mean?

20:08.786 --> 20:12.244
Waiter. If I don't get something
to drink soon, I'm gonna die.

20:12.323 --> 20:13.722
Y ou promise?

20:16.293 --> 20:18.818
Will, I don't think
he's going to come with us.

20:18.896 --> 20:20.887
Don't worry, baby. Plan B.

20:26.103 --> 20:27.730
Say, Miss, check it out, look...

20:27.805 --> 20:30.035
me and my partner
can't afford nothing on this menu.

20:30.107 --> 20:33.167
Probably, a Vaseline
and salt sandwich if they had one.

20:33.244 --> 20:35.235
Check it out, I'll give you $5 for that salad.

20:35.312 --> 20:36.677
- What?
- All right, $6.50.

20:36.747 --> 20:38.806
Wait, check it out, $7 for just the lettuce.

20:38.883 --> 20:40.373
Well, I never.

20:40.584 --> 20:43.712
All this money he paying for this food,
girl, you better.

20:44.955 --> 20:47.788
- What? What's up? What's up? What?
- I'm so sorry.

20:49.994 --> 20:51.518
Y ou're embarrassing me.

20:51.595 --> 20:54.063
Well, you know what you have to do
to get rid of us.

20:54.131 --> 20:57.794
I know you're trying to get me fired,
but it won't work.

20:58.135 --> 20:59.534
Just leave.

20:59.770 --> 21:01.169
Oh, my God!

21:02.973 --> 21:05.771
What, are you blind? Y our table's on fire.
Pay attention.

21:05.843 --> 21:08.937
- Y ou idiot!
- What is going here?

21:11.749 --> 21:13.410
Should I tell him?

21:13.684 --> 21:15.618
Or do you want to, Dad?

21:17.154 --> 21:20.089
- This is your son?
- Of course not.

21:20.157 --> 21:22.853
Is it our fault you never married Mom?

21:25.863 --> 21:27.922
I know she embarrassed you.

21:28.499 --> 21:29.932
She only had one arm...

21:30.000 --> 21:32.867
and when you would go to concerts,
she clapped like this.

21:39.810 --> 21:42.005
Surely, you don't believe this.

21:42.079 --> 21:44.513
Daddy, you're ashamed of us?

21:48.052 --> 21:50.179
This is my brother, Carlton.

21:50.588 --> 21:54.786
He knows we can't afford any
bigger clothes so he just doesn't grow.

21:59.663 --> 22:01.858
Daddy, I want to grow.

22:04.568 --> 22:08.163
He's never even been
on a roller coaster for God's sakes.

22:10.574 --> 22:13.202
Y ou two are really something.

22:14.445 --> 22:16.572
Something good or something bad?

22:17.081 --> 22:20.482
I can't believe you'd go through all this
to get me back.

22:21.218 --> 22:22.651
We miss you.

22:23.354 --> 22:24.981
We love you, Dad.

22:28.826 --> 22:32.193
All right. I'll come back home.

22:34.131 --> 22:37.897
Daddy's coming home. Thank you, Daddy.

22:38.002 --> 22:41.733
Thank you. Daddy's coming... Thank you.
Daddy's coming home.

23:03.827 --> 23:05.294
Y ou so crazy.

23:09.300 --> 23:11.029
<i>/'m crazy about you, gir/.</i>
