I wasn't upset at you guys,
I was upset at myself.

-'Cause when I messed up
that dance as a kid,

03:05.489 --> 03:07.926
I think I messed up
my relationship with my dad.

03:07.970 --> 03:10.015
He really wanted me
to win that pageant

03:10.059 --> 03:11.278

I wonder if I nailed
that dance,

have gotten so bad
between us.

Beauty Pageant.

03:29.948 --> 03:33.822
Raven, you can't compete
in a children's
beauty pageant.

03:33.865 --> 03:34.953
Because I'm too old?

03:34.997 --> 03:38.043
Because I'm already
competing in it.

They call me "Lil' Dimples."

Friend Raven,
have you considered this
is the Trigon's sneaky plan?

04:02.503 --> 04:06.202
Yeah, I bet he's trying
to trick you into unleashing
your inner demon and what not.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.291
So you's can rule
the world together.

04:08.335 --> 04:09.466
You might be right.

04:09.510 --> 04:10.902
But maybe when
he sees me dance,

04:10.946 --> 04:12.948
he'll forget
about enslaving the world.

04:12.991 --> 04:14.384
Then I believes

you's got a children's

a giant lollipop?
-No.

the good enough,
friend Raven.

06:20.162 --> 06:21.555
It has to be perfect.

06:21.598 --> 06:24.122
My dad was very specific
about the choreography.

he's not gonna show up.

Your dance was actually
an evil ritual

08:42.434 --> 08:43.697
to unlock the portal.

08:43.740 --> 08:45.525
That's why it was
so specific.

Don't you get it?
I don't wanna rule
