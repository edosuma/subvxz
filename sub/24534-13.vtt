00:18.390 --> 00:21.848
Quinn, do you copy?

00:21.930 --> 00:25.343
I repeat, do you copy?

00:25.440 --> 00:26.509
He's not here, June.

00:26.610 --> 00:29.647
He's got to be close.
He said he just passed marker 20.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.231
Maybe we should go back.

00:31.320 --> 00:34.357
He could show up back at the semi.

00:36.530 --> 00:37.986
We should keep looking.

00:38.330 --> 00:41.697
I'm with her. Asshole has my van.

00:43.500 --> 00:48.278
Knock, knock,
amigos.
You got a guest; or a goose egg?

00:48.380 --> 00:51.008
There was no sign of him,
but we're gonna keep looking.

00:51.550 --> 00:54.337
You let us know if you see anyth/hg, yea/7?

00:54.430 --> 00:55.670
10-4, Mo-Mo.

00:55.840 --> 00:56.829
Please don ’t call me that.

00:56.930 --> 00:58.466
What the hell is this? An airport shuttle?

00:58.550 --> 01:01.519
We just gonna keep adding names
to the list of people we're picking up?

01:01.600 --> 01:02.840
I don't know, Jimbo.

01:02.930 --> 01:06.434
Maybe we should take your name
off the list.

01:06.520 --> 01:09.728
You need me.
Why the hell did you kidnap me?

01:09.820 --> 01:12.641
Wow. Don't be so dramatic.
We just borrowed you.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.526
- Yeah?
- We needed to learn some things.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.156
We need beer.

01:17.240 --> 01:20.789
Maybe you could learn a little.

01:20.870 --> 01:23.691
I'm sure you could achieve
swill in a year.

01:23.790 --> 01:25.701
Maybe that's good enough for you, Sarah.

01:25.790 --> 01:27.451
But you want a good beer.

01:27.670 --> 01:32.039
Some say the best beer.
And that's my mind.

01:32.130 --> 01:37.420
My experience. These fingers. This soul.

01:42.010 --> 01:43.716
I'll cover Mr. Soul Man.

01:45.230 --> 01:49.052
Time to stir the beef.

01:58.320 --> 01:59.446
I need a gun.

01:59.530 --> 02:03.239
Oh, no, no, no. Here, I got some rebar.
You want that?

02:03.330 --> 02:08.108
Matter of fact, how about a rock?
You want a rock?

02:08.210 --> 02:09.325
Wendell.

02:14.800 --> 02:16.256
Stay in front of me, Soul Man.

02:18.260 --> 02:19.249
Wendell?

02:21.680 --> 02:24.558
- Give me that damn gun!
- Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. I got this, partner.

02:24.640 --> 02:27.052
Be easy, be easy.
Stay right there, Greasy.

02:27.140 --> 02:29.552
- Sarah!
- Let him come. Let him come.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.186
I got this. Come on.

02:31.480 --> 02:32.765
Mmm. Uh-huh.

02:36.490 --> 02:37.730
Oh!

02:37.820 --> 02:39.026
Come on.

02:39.110 --> 02:42.364
Want your first kill? You get a point
for every one you kill. Watch this.

02:48.290 --> 02:50.076
That was my point!

02:50.170 --> 02:53.412
Whoever gets the kill
wins the bill.

02:53.500 --> 02:55.297
Guys? You should see this.

03:02.470 --> 03:04.756
Mo-Mo, get your ass back to the truck.

03:10.730 --> 03:11.890
Is that Quinn?

03:14.110 --> 03:16.931
What kind of sicko shitto does that?

03:19.860 --> 03:23.114
Quinn, are you out there?
I repeat, are you there?

03:23.200 --> 03:24.986
Are we just gonna wait here,
like sitting ducks?

03:26.620 --> 03:29.407
We need to leave, now.

03:29.500 --> 03:30.865
Beer boy's got a point.

03:32.670 --> 03:34.877
Quinn, do you copy?

03:42.760 --> 03:43.920
Quinn?

03:45.930 --> 03:48.592
That's Quinn. The genuine article.

03:49.850 --> 03:52.091
What does that mean? Who is this?

03:52.190 --> 03:55.648
Golly. 50 many quesﬁons.
Here’s the answer.

03:55.730 --> 04:01.191
I let him become what he was meant to be.

04:10.660 --> 04:13.959
You hear that? He's not weak any more.

04:16.540 --> 04:21.830
That voice. I know that voice.

04:22.050 --> 04:24.792
The road. You were by one of the boxes.

04:27.470 --> 04:28.926
Is that you, Morgan?

04:35.230 --> 04:36.299
How'd you know my name?

04:36.860 --> 04:39.476
I know a lot about you, Morgan.

04:39.730 --> 04:41.732
Bitch has my van.

04:42.400 --> 04:43.606
She has the tapes.

04:47.660 --> 04:49.116
What do you want?

04:49.200 --> 04:51.942
You shou/dn ’t be lea V/ng those
by the side of the road.

04:52.450 --> 04:57.376
Those boxes. They make people weak.

04:57.460 --> 05:00.247
And you're not weak, Morgan.

05:00.340 --> 05:01.796
At least, you didn't used to be.

05:03.630 --> 05:05.120
What do you want?

05:05.220 --> 05:07.461
I want you to stop.

05:07.550 --> 05:11.134
If you stop trying to help people,

05:11.220 --> 05:14.178
then you'll be strong again.

05:14.270 --> 05:15.931
And I won't have to make you that way.

05:17.020 --> 05:21.468
Trust me, Morgan.
It’s better for both of us.

05:22.530 --> 05:26.022
I know who you really are.

05:26.110 --> 05:28.738
I know what you're really capable of.

05:31.620 --> 05:36.455
You o’io’n ’t say all of it;
but you said enough.

05:36.830 --> 05:40.789
And I can see it.

05:40.880 --> 05:42.666
It's still there.

05:43.460 --> 05:47.669
It’s 5177/ there.

07:30.700 --> 07:33.112
Come on.

07:53.890 --> 07:57.007
Ugh. I hate the wet ones.

08:13.530 --> 08:14.610
Oh, come on.

08:16.030 --> 08:17.691
Early bird kills the dead, huh?

08:19.160 --> 08:22.323
Oof. "Draws 'em out," more like.

08:22.500 --> 08:26.914
I think our particular early bird might be
what's been attracting the passed.

08:27.590 --> 08:29.751
And disturbing my morning reading.

08:31.010 --> 08:34.889
We used to get grackles up by my cabin.
Big flocks of 'em.

08:34.970 --> 08:39.134
Never once saw one flying solo like this.

08:39.220 --> 08:41.677
As if the world ain't been turned
upside-down enough.

08:41.770 --> 08:43.010
You finished?

08:43.100 --> 08:44.590
Eh.

08:44.690 --> 08:47.932
Could've gone twice as fast
ifI had another pair of hands.

08:48.270 --> 08:49.350
Hmm.

08:49.440 --> 08:51.351
I lost my stomach for boating a while ago.

08:52.070 --> 08:56.769
And getting caught in a flash flood
didn't exactly restore my interest.

08:56.870 --> 08:59.907
And we both know that
these aren't friendly waters.

09:00.120 --> 09:01.690
Well, we ain't going for a swim.

09:02.790 --> 09:05.532
If you get as far as the car,
I'll be impressed.

09:09.500 --> 09:12.549
You know, there's room for two on this.
I built it that way.

09:13.800 --> 09:15.836
These waters are moving slower
than a one-legged dog.

09:16.220 --> 09:20.429
Could take weeks before it drains.
Might never if the levees broke.

09:20.720 --> 09:23.302
I've got ample rations and my white whale.
I'll make do.

09:24.810 --> 09:27.267
IfI had a drink,
this would practically be paradise.

09:27.350 --> 09:31.059
Of course, I had paradise,
but I was drawn into a fool's errand

09:31.150 --> 09:33.482
at a time when fools routinely die,
and if you have something,

09:33.570 --> 09:36.607
say, an estate with God's wine cellar,
you keep it.

09:36.700 --> 09:38.315
You don't go out helping to find
the instrument

09:38.410 --> 09:40.981
of your last safe place's demise.
No.

09:41.160 --> 09:45.494
I'm not getting in on
whatever that thing is.

09:45.580 --> 09:46.820
I'm finally starting to get it.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.205
Get what?

09:48.290 --> 09:50.372
It's time to stop being foolish.

09:50.460 --> 09:53.418
You know, this is me using my head.

09:53.510 --> 09:56.582
_ This is me _ _
getting out of a dangerous Situation.

09:56.680 --> 09:57.874
You could, too.

09:59.970 --> 10:02.006
Come on.

10:02.100 --> 10:05.422
Okay. But as soon as
I find June and Charlie,

10:05.520 --> 10:09.058
I'm coming straight back here for you
in something a little less handmade.

10:09.440 --> 10:12.512
I hear, but I won't count on it.

10:12.690 --> 10:15.352
You're gonna run out of food
before this water goes down!

10:15.440 --> 10:18.523
How cute that you even consider
tomorrow, or the next day.

10:18.700 --> 10:22.739
I just hope that thing falls apart
near the shoreline!

10:22.830 --> 10:24.866
It won't fall apart.

10:50.560 --> 10:51.800
Charlie?

11:12.420 --> 11:13.956
Hey!

11:32.060 --> 11:33.721
I can help.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.146
How long have you been here?

11:36.230 --> 11:37.606
Since the storm.

11:38.990 --> 11:40.230
I'm gonna get you out of here.

11:46.330 --> 11:48.901
My name's Clayton.

11:51.790 --> 11:54.418
Luciana.

11:54.500 --> 11:58.049
You look like
you been through the wringer.

11:58.130 --> 12:02.089
Why do you want to help a total stranger?

12:05.640 --> 12:07.380
I have some things to make up for.

12:08.890 --> 12:10.175
Don't we all.

12:26.780 --> 12:28.907
Yeah.

12:29.290 --> 12:32.202
This is your last chance.
You sure you don't want to come?

12:32.750 --> 12:35.662
Of this, I'm most certain.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.254
But I'll watch.

12:56.350 --> 12:58.181
Wood's too dense.

13:03.150 --> 13:04.230
John!

13:20.420 --> 13:23.753
The damn passed have taken
all the fear out of 'em.

13:23.920 --> 13:26.718
You think she'd be full by now.

13:26.800 --> 13:31.248
Well, looks like
you and I are still roomies.

13:45.950 --> 13:49.272
You bury them?
What difference does it make?

13:57.170 --> 13:58.535
Hey!

13:58.630 --> 14:02.088
How many more journals, er, did, er--

14:02.380 --> 14:03.415
Polar Bear.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.410
The man's name is Polar Bear.

14:06.420 --> 14:07.796
How many journals did he write?

14:07.880 --> 14:09.791
We got
dos,
and that's it.

14:09.890 --> 14:13.678
The man was a poet of the pavement.
Got a lot of memorable sayings in there.

14:14.140 --> 14:15.550
I don't think he'd feel
too good about them

14:15.640 --> 14:17.688
ending up on the faces of the dead.

14:19.100 --> 14:22.263
She's out there.

14:22.360 --> 14:24.430
And she's hurting people,
and it ain't just us.

14:25.740 --> 14:28.607
If they're giving help, or if they're
in need of help, she is hurting them.

14:29.280 --> 14:32.522
So, we're gonna find John and Alicia
and Charlie and Strand,

14:32.620 --> 14:35.032
and the guy who used to
own this truck, okay?

14:35.910 --> 14:38.242
- Polar Bear._Jesus.
- The man's name IS Polar Bear.

14:38.330 --> 14:40.742
Hey, we don't even know
if he's still alive.

14:40.830 --> 14:42.832
Oh, he's still alive. Yeah.

14:43.000 --> 14:47.255
We wouldn't have stolen his truck
if he couldn't take care of himself.

14:47.420 --> 14:52.005
Quinn looked like someone
who could have taken care of himself, too.

14:52.100 --> 14:55.217
We got to find everyone. Now.

14:56.350 --> 14:57.840
Let's hit the road.

14:57.930 --> 15:00.763
Hey, what about
what that nutjob said?

15:00.850 --> 15:02.306
What about it?

15:03.730 --> 15:08.986
Well, she said she knows
what you're capable of.

15:09.070 --> 15:10.196
What's that mean?

15:15.790 --> 15:17.246
Doesn't matter.

15:17.330 --> 15:23.200
No. We agreed to come with you.
We deserve to know.

15:24.460 --> 15:27.839
That's twice today I agree with him.

15:33.180 --> 15:36.172
I've got some things I got to make up for.

15:36.260 --> 15:40.435
You know, same as anybody else here. Okay?

15:40.520 --> 15:43.091
Now, we should hit the road.

15:43.190 --> 15:44.600
And if we say no?

15:44.690 --> 15:47.727
Then I'll take your truck,
and we'll keep doing what I been doing.

15:49.320 --> 15:50.480
You're gonna take the truck?

15:51.700 --> 15:52.906
That's right.

15:52.990 --> 15:56.369
Man, do you know how to handle
80,000 pounds of metal

15:56.450 --> 15:58.862
- at 80 miles an hour?
- I do.

15:59.410 --> 16:02.459
Not any harder than my van.

16:02.620 --> 16:06.579
I want to talk to the guy
that set all this up.

16:08.460 --> 16:12.499
Listen. If you think that you can just
come in here...

16:20.390 --> 16:21.425
Okay.

16:21.520 --> 16:24.307
- We going with you.
- Yeah, new plan.

16:49.550 --> 16:52.963
- She doesn't seem to be going anywhere.
- Yeah.

16:53.130 --> 16:55.462
There's gotta be a way through 'em.

16:55.550 --> 16:56.847
Ha!

16:56.930 --> 16:59.501
So, your plan is to
surmount one impossibility

16:59.600 --> 17:01.340
to surmount another impossibility.

17:02.350 --> 17:05.183
You're expecting to find June. Out there.

17:06.190 --> 17:10.729
I found her before.
After you all told me she was dead.

17:10.900 --> 17:13.107
The world didn't want me to keep looking,
but I did.

17:13.780 --> 17:15.987
And look where that's landed.

17:16.070 --> 17:19.949
I know there ain't no happy endings,
but you gotta fight for every day.

17:21.040 --> 17:24.282
I found somebody
that I want to fight alongside.

17:24.370 --> 17:27.453
Look here. This was her favourite.

17:27.540 --> 17:29.747
Found that in my shirt pocket
the day the storm hit.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.410
Road flooded, and we washed up here.

17:31.840 --> 17:35.378
Little things like this
make you want to keep fighting.

17:35.470 --> 17:37.791
So, you ain't gonna change my mind.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.381
I'm gonna get off this island.
I'm gonna find her.

17:40.470 --> 17:41.880
I'm gonna give her this when I do.

17:41.970 --> 17:43.517
Why? Why keep believing that's true?

17:43.600 --> 17:45.682
Why keep believing
things will get any better than this?

17:45.770 --> 17:47.806
Well, if we don't believe
things will get better,

17:47.900 --> 17:50.471
we don't believe
that we can make 'em that way,

17:50.570 --> 17:55.109
if we don't fight for every day,
we're no different than the passed.

17:56.610 --> 17:59.818
The only difference
between us and the passed,

17:59.910 --> 18:02.231
is a few days' rations.

18:43.410 --> 18:45.492
No,no,no!

18:45.580 --> 18:47.957
It's okay. I'm gonna get you out of this.

18:48.120 --> 18:49.997
I'm sorry, little lady.

18:50.080 --> 18:55.416
It's nice that you want to try,
that you think you can, but you can't.

18:56.130 --> 18:59.429
The car's the only thing
keeping me together.

18:59.590 --> 19:02.002
No, there's got to be something I can do!

19:10.900 --> 19:14.859
Is there anyone you want me to find?

19:14.940 --> 19:16.521
Anyone who might be looking for you?

19:18.240 --> 19:20.231
Just one person,

19:20.320 --> 19:23.869
but it's the only person in the world
I don't want to see.

19:25.080 --> 19:30.029
Everyone else, the rest of my people,
they're all gone.

19:31.670 --> 19:34.161
Hey, hey.

19:35.210 --> 19:37.838
I never thought I'd go out like this.

19:45.180 --> 19:46.966
What?

19:47.060 --> 19:50.132
- Nah, nah.
- Tell me.

19:51.770 --> 19:54.557
I'd love to have one last beer.

20:02.240 --> 20:03.810
You're gonna get one.

20:14.040 --> 20:17.043
You're gonna have to keep talking to me.

20:18.710 --> 20:23.670
Channel 17. No one uses it.

20:23.760 --> 20:25.387
Okay.

20:35.610 --> 20:37.009
That's never gonna work.

20:37.110 --> 20:38.850
That camper shell will float
better than the wood.

20:41.900 --> 20:44.232
And what about our reptilian friend?

20:44.320 --> 20:46.948
You make enough noise, you draw enough
of the passed to the other shore,

20:47.030 --> 20:48.406
he'll never even know I'm there.

20:49.990 --> 20:53.778
And I assume you want me to retrieve
said camper shell.

20:53.960 --> 20:55.496
The only reason I can't do it myself

20:55.580 --> 20:57.207
is on account of what
you and your friends dId to me.

20:57.290 --> 20:58.336
Huh.

20:58.420 --> 21:00.911
That's the second time you invoked
your injury to get me to do something.

21:01.510 --> 21:03.626
Well, it ain't exactly a skinned knee.

21:05.550 --> 21:09.134
You be careful up there.

21:10.010 --> 21:12.979
We stole his rig at this yardstick.

21:13.060 --> 21:15.972
He really should've been
changing up where he made the drops.

21:16.150 --> 21:19.392
Yeah, he really screwed up,
trying to save people's lives.

21:20.480 --> 21:23.984
You think you stealing his truck
was his fault?

21:25.860 --> 21:29.444
Hey, this is a full-on
frog/scorpion situation here.

21:29.740 --> 21:34.951
We can't help it if he's the kinda frog
that leaves his keys in his rig.

21:35.290 --> 21:38.077
Ribbit did it. Not on us.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.161
Well, if we're lucky,
he's still around here somewhere.

21:41.550 --> 21:44.417
Yeah, or he's walking around
with Sharpie on his face,

21:44.510 --> 21:46.216
courtesy of our friend on the walkie.

21:46.800 --> 21:49.007
Your point being, Jimbo?

21:49.100 --> 21:52.012
Should we really be leaving these things,
knowing what we know?

21:52.720 --> 21:53.880
Yeah.

21:55.520 --> 21:57.431
Yeah, we should.

22:12.290 --> 22:13.439
Morgan?

22:17.710 --> 22:20.281
- Hey, you mind?
- Yeah.

22:47.110 --> 22:48.520
You think John'll see one of these?

22:50.660 --> 22:55.324
We're gonna find him.
You know, one way or another.

22:57.040 --> 22:58.109
We'll find 'em all.

23:06.130 --> 23:07.961
You got it!

23:18.140 --> 23:21.189
Now, if you just release the latches,
gravity'll do the rest.

23:21.940 --> 23:23.510
I know what I'm doing, John!

23:36.660 --> 23:37.945
Everything okay up there?

23:38.370 --> 23:39.610
Everything's fine.

23:46.380 --> 23:47.870
What the hell are you doing?

23:58.350 --> 23:59.419
No, no, no.

24:09.400 --> 24:11.027
Victor!

24:13.360 --> 24:15.988
Victor! Victor?

24:23.750 --> 24:26.583
- You all right?
- Well, how about that?

24:35.600 --> 24:39.138
Victor! Hey!
You almost got yourself killed back there!

24:39.220 --> 24:40.676
- But I didn't.
- Yeah, but you could've!

24:40.770 --> 24:42.135
- But _I didn't.
- VIctor!

24:42.230 --> 24:44.016
Look, let's just be honest here, John.

24:44.100 --> 24:46.261
You're just upset 'cause
you didn't want to lose your distraction.

24:46.360 --> 24:50.228
No, no. I'm upset because you almost
killed yourself, so, you could tie one on.

24:52.700 --> 24:53.906
Is that what you think this is?

24:53.990 --> 24:55.617
Yeah. That's about
the long and short of it,

24:55.700 --> 24:59.784
unless you want to tell me
something different.

24:59.870 --> 25:01.940
Good luck with raft number two.

25:02.040 --> 25:05.532
I'll be your noisemaker when you need me.

26:16.400 --> 26:20.188
How’s it going
out there, little lady?

26:21.410 --> 26:25.744
I'm getting close. I know it.

27:54.750 --> 27:57.332
Man, you always drink?

27:57.420 --> 27:59.411
Even before?

28:02.970 --> 28:07.213
I was an amateur. I've gone pro.

28:07.390 --> 28:09.221
What for?

28:13.560 --> 28:17.223
- I drink to forget.
- Forget what?

28:19.860 --> 28:23.819
That I don't have anyone
to drink with any more.

28:26.370 --> 28:31.490
You've got things to look forward to
over there.

28:31.580 --> 28:34.822
I only have things to look back on.

28:36.750 --> 28:40.834
That's not true.
You do have someone to share a drink with.

28:43.930 --> 28:48.173
We're just not gonna have it here.
We're gonna have it over there.

28:51.140 --> 28:52.596
What about your distraction?

28:55.230 --> 28:56.390
I got it.

28:58.270 --> 28:59.931
Yeah?

29:02.190 --> 29:03.270
Whoo!

29:03.860 --> 29:05.350
Battery from the truck...

29:05.450 --> 29:06.439
Sorry.

29:06.530 --> 29:08.657
Battery from the truck
had some juice left in it.

29:08.740 --> 29:11.197
Enough to call the passed
out to Big Scaly.

29:14.290 --> 29:15.917
You don't think it'll work?

29:16.000 --> 29:20.664
Well, I didn't think you'd survive
a bullet to the gut, but here we are.

29:21.760 --> 29:25.969
You just gotta believe.
You just gotta fight for that next day.

29:26.050 --> 29:27.256
You coming?

29:30.810 --> 29:31.845
You coming?

29:34.350 --> 29:35.430
Yeah.

29:40.650 --> 29:42.060
Okay. All right, all right, all right.

29:46.570 --> 29:49.232
You okay, little lady?

29:53.040 --> 29:57.158
I'm sorry. I thought I had it, but...

29:57.330 --> 29:59.127
Nothing to be sorry for.

29:59.380 --> 30:01.120
You tried to help.

30:01.210 --> 30:04.589
Not a lot of folks out here
still willing to do that,

30:04.670 --> 30:06.331
especially for a total stranger.

30:07.510 --> 30:09.842
What does it matter? I failed.

30:11.510 --> 30:13.717
Let me tell you a story.

30:14.350 --> 30:19.356
There was a time
when I didn ’t want to be around anyone.

30:19.440 --> 30:24.025
So, I found a job
that took me away from the world,

30:24.110 --> 30:29.616
away from everyone I ever knew,
everyone I ever cared about.

30:29.700 --> 30:34.364
And then, when the world changed,

30:34.450 --> 30:36.862
when everyone went away,

30:36.960 --> 30:41.624
I realized I'd made
the biggest mistake of my life.

30:44.670 --> 30:46.297
What did you do?

30:47.380 --> 30:50.793
I couldn't help the people
I had run away from,

30:50.890 --> 30:54.803
so, I found a way to help the people
who were still around.

30:55.980 --> 30:57.516
I don't understand.

30:59.020 --> 31:02.399
Just because you weren't
able to help me, Luci,

31:02.480 --> 31:07.736
doesn't mean you're not gonna be able
to help someone else.

31:28.340 --> 31:30.547
You ready?

31:30.630 --> 31:33.042
I may need a drink
before we reach the other side.

31:48.440 --> 31:49.566
Now!

33:27.790 --> 33:29.121
Well, that's a pickle.

33:30.050 --> 33:32.917
Damn grackle.

33:37.010 --> 33:39.922
It's okay. Shell's made of fibreglass.
Pretty strong.

34:01.830 --> 34:02.899
Did you get her?

34:08.500 --> 34:09.535
Oh!

34:11.710 --> 34:14.668
We got... We got about a minute, tops.

34:14.920 --> 34:16.296
Hey, hey! See there?

34:18.140 --> 34:19.846
See, we could make it to the other side.

34:19.930 --> 34:22.387
I'll empty my pistol.
I'll draw those other two over more.

34:22.470 --> 34:24.677
- That should occupy any gator.
- We're not gonna make it.

34:25.180 --> 34:27.432
- Oh, come on, Victor!
- We have seconds here!

34:28.100 --> 34:30.898
You can't fight when you're dead, John.
It didn't work.

34:31.070 --> 34:32.139
- It could work!
- Oh, yeah?

34:32.230 --> 34:35.484
You gonna swim across fast enough?
You can't even row a boat!

34:35.650 --> 34:38.562
And those two walkers won't occupy
that thing for long. It didn't work.

34:38.910 --> 34:40.059
It was never gonna work.

34:40.160 --> 34:42.025
I only bought into your bullshit
because I felt sorry for you,

34:42.120 --> 34:43.155
but I'm not gonna die for you.

34:43.700 --> 34:46.954
Fire your gun, and let's swim back, now!

35:01.850 --> 35:03.249
We could make it.

35:06.930 --> 35:08.761
See, we could make it!

35:08.980 --> 35:11.016
You can't. I'm going.

35:11.230 --> 35:14.643
I'm gonna live,
if only for a little longer.

35:56.780 --> 36:00.648
You don't give up.

36:10.960 --> 36:14.452
I watched someone die.

36:14.540 --> 36:18.909
And I couldn't do anything to make him
feel better in his last moments.

36:20.630 --> 36:22.427
I wasn't gonna let that happen again.

36:41.280 --> 36:42.850
It's cold.

36:44.160 --> 36:46.446
First-aid kit had an ice pack in it.

37:03.090 --> 37:04.830
Thank you.

37:12.230 --> 37:16.439
Can I give you something, too?

37:18.110 --> 37:22.023
Couple of notebooks in the back.

37:22.110 --> 37:24.772
Places where I left supplies.

37:26.570 --> 37:29.277
Things that'll help when you...

37:29.370 --> 37:32.828
Well, you know, you'll read about it.

37:41.340 --> 37:45.834
Your job? That took you away
from everyone you cared about?

37:47.220 --> 37:48.255
What was it?

37:59.440 --> 38:03.069
I drove trucks.

38:21.710 --> 38:26.545
Whoever left that box,
if you're listening,

38:27.510 --> 38:28.829
thank you.

38:30.930 --> 38:33.421
What you left,

38:33.520 --> 38:36.557
it helped more than you will ever know.

38:50.620 --> 38:54.693
Ludana, Is that you?

38:54.790 --> 38:55.825
Morgan?

40:24.920 --> 40:28.208
He said these were important.
He felt they could help us.

40:28.300 --> 40:31.792
Did he know where you found the beer?

40:33.340 --> 40:35.137
I didn't get a chance to tell him.

40:40.850 --> 40:43.557
But I think he'll like what you're doing.

40:47.980 --> 40:51.564
Hello? Is someone there?

40:53.410 --> 40:54.775
Hello?

40:54.870 --> 40:56.110
What are you doing?

40:57.030 --> 40:59.237
We don't know who left that there.
That could be a trap.

41:00.160 --> 41:01.650
Hello. We ’re here.

41:02.620 --> 41:03.746
Morgan?

41:04.210 --> 41:08.089
Alicia? Hey, where are you? You all right?

41:11.090 --> 41:15.880
We're by mile marker 84.
We found this box.

41:17.350 --> 41:21.218
You did? We're just north of you.
We'll come back.

41:22.430 --> 41:27.436
Iga ve you the chance
to be strong.

41:27.520 --> 41:28.566
Who is this?

41:28.650 --> 41:31.312
Hey, Alicia. I know her.

41:35.860 --> 41:38.328
Now, I want you to listen to me,
because you're wrong.

41:39.620 --> 41:42.942
What you said about helping people,
it doesn't make us weak.

41:43.210 --> 41:47.874
It doesn't make them weak.
It makes all of us stronger.

41:53.760 --> 41:55.421
I've been where you are.

41:56.300 --> 41:58.006
Stuck.

41:58.090 --> 42:00.172
You think you ’re out there on your own.

42:00.970 --> 42:03.552
You think what you're doing
is the right thing,

42:03.640 --> 42:06.552
that it's the only thing.

42:06.650 --> 42:08.049
But it's not.

42:16.660 --> 42:19.151
So, we're gonna keep finding the people
we're looking for.

42:21.580 --> 42:24.697
It's working already.
We're gonna find them,

42:24.790 --> 42:26.075
and we're gonna help them.

42:28.500 --> 42:30.036
And then...

42:31.040 --> 42:34.544
Then we're gonna help you.

42:37.590 --> 42:39.831
Hey, ,4/.
That van you were talking about.

42:39.930 --> 42:41.420
What exactly does it look l/ke?

42:41.510 --> 42:43.512
What the hell is going on?

42:43.600 --> 42:47.013
Cat II MRAP. It's a... It's a tank. Why?

42:49.400 --> 42:52.392
I think we found it.
It's at our back door, 5:00.

42:57.650 --> 42:58.526
Holy shit.

42:59.320 --> 43:01.311
Hit the gas.
That thing's sluggish as hell.

43:01.780 --> 43:04.237
What do you think we are?

43:09.620 --> 43:11.326
- It's gaining on us.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:14.750 --> 43:15.910
Come on.

43:21.600 --> 43:23.750
Hey. Hey! What you doing?

43:34.070 --> 43:37.437
I told you, I'm making you strong.

43:38.150 --> 43:41.233
You lose people, you lose yourself.

43:45.580 --> 43:48.242
Get down. Everybody, get down!

43:54.750 --> 43:55.990
Morgan?

43:56.090 --> 43:59.503
Morgan?

43:59.590 --> 44:01.251
Morgan!
