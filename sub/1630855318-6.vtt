00:00.087 --> 00:02.132
Previously...

00:02.132 --> 00:03.481
on "The Real Housewives
of Atlanta"...

00:06.919 --> 00:08.573
Come on
and introduce me.

00:08.573 --> 00:10.053
Introduce me, diva.

00:10.053 --> 00:13.578
Marlo, how did you
get your money game up?

00:13.578 --> 00:15.102
God.

00:15.102 --> 00:17.756
Some people say that
she had a old white sugar daddy

00:17.756 --> 00:19.106
before she got
with Charles.

00:20.672 --> 00:22.631
I've just been hearing things.
I wanna know.

00:22.631 --> 00:24.285
Kandi, are you a lesbian?

00:27.897 --> 00:29.681
How are we even here,
first of all?

00:29.681 --> 00:31.335
I don't know.

00:31.335 --> 00:32.684
Kandi, I wanna be
your personal shopper.

00:32.684 --> 00:34.338
Just give me your card.

00:34.338 --> 00:35.470
I'm not.

00:37.037 --> 00:37.907
Give me a hug.
I ain't seen you in forever.

00:37.907 --> 00:38.995
I know.

00:38.995 --> 00:40.823
This is my older
sister's kids.

00:40.823 --> 00:42.129
They're with you
for the summer?

00:42.129 --> 00:43.521
They've been with me
for the last five months.

00:43.521 --> 00:44.696

- Hello.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

01:16.163 --> 01:18.904
- Whoo-hoo-hoo.
- Let me take this in.

01:18.904 --> 01:20.341
I made it
to the main house.

01:20.341 --> 01:22.734
People always wanna
define Marlo

01:22.734 --> 01:24.171
by her mugshots,

01:24.171 --> 01:27.174
but she's
really kind-hearted.

01:27.174 --> 01:28.523
You're going
to leave us.

01:28.523 --> 01:30.568
- Mm-hmm, thankfully.
- Riley, don't leave us.

01:30.568 --> 01:31.874
Thankfully?

01:31.874 --> 01:33.310
She's very thoughtful.

01:33.310 --> 01:35.399
She's a really sweet person.

01:35.399 --> 01:37.923
I don't wanna bring
any rain on you guys,

01:37.923 --> 01:41.101
but my nephew was 30,
and he lived here in Atlanta,

01:41.101 --> 01:43.755
and a roommate
murdered him.

01:43.755 --> 01:45.105
- Damn.
- Isn't that sad?

01:45.105 --> 01:46.628
With all this going on
in the world,

01:46.628 --> 01:48.369
it may be, like--
- It was at their apartment?

01:48.369 --> 01:50.327
Yeah, and I just
ran upstairs

01:50.327 --> 01:52.634
to Michael and William,
and I'm just, like,

01:52.634 --> 01:54.462
kissing them,
and, I mean, golly, Ry,

01:54.462 --> 01:56.551
I hate to do this
to you, but--

01:56.551 --> 01:59.467
and I'm just, like, God,
you have to tell people

01:59.467 --> 02:01.382
you love 'em
while they're here.

02:01.382 --> 02:06.126
I know this has to be
a terrible loss for Marlo

02:06.126 --> 02:08.215
because she sees
all of her nephews and nieces

02:08.215 --> 02:10.521
as her children,
and I can get that

02:10.521 --> 02:13.829
because I have cousins
that-that are like kids to me.

02:13.829 --> 02:17.746
I feel like if, Lord forbid,
something happened to them,

02:17.746 --> 02:20.227
I would be--

02:20.227 --> 02:22.620
you would-- oh,
the world would be over.

02:22.620 --> 02:24.492
You know, my brother died
when I was 15.

02:24.492 --> 02:26.102
It-it numbed me.

02:26.102 --> 02:27.625
It's just a lot.

02:32.108 --> 02:34.023
Hi, Kandi-yams.
You look so cute.

02:34.023 --> 02:35.677
Look at you
looking all cute.

02:35.677 --> 02:37.418
You're the only one
that sent a Cash App

02:37.418 --> 02:39.681
for graduation,
a birthday.

02:39.681 --> 02:41.117
I appreciate that,

02:41.117 --> 02:43.380
but I would even appreciate
more hands-on.

02:43.380 --> 02:45.034
First of all,
Kandi was a damn ho.

02:45.034 --> 02:46.427
She----ed
everybody for free.

02:46.427 --> 02:47.863
Frustrated 'cause
we want help from your ass!

02:47.863 --> 02:49.865
I'm getting frustrated
because I've tried to help!

02:49.865 --> 02:51.388
That is sh--, man!

02:51.388 --> 02:53.085
You're a lying-ass bitch.
I've come through for you.

02:53.085 --> 02:54.826
And you're only known
in Atlanta, baby.

02:54.826 --> 02:56.437
Bitch, I'm worldwide!

02:58.830 --> 03:00.615
Kandi Burruss can talk
about what she wants,

03:00.615 --> 03:01.877
so y'all stop talking
about stuff.

03:01.877 --> 03:03.095
Oh, really?
Okay, well, let's talk about

03:03.095 --> 03:04.227
when you cut the girl
in the face.

03:04.227 --> 03:05.750
Over 23 years ago.

03:11.887 --> 03:13.149
- Hi. Welcome.
- How you doin'?

03:13.149 --> 03:14.455
- Table for three?
- Yes, table for three.

03:14.455 --> 03:15.804
Thank you.
- Okay, perfect.

03:15.804 --> 03:17.284
You can follow me
this way.

03:20.635 --> 03:22.245
Tye, this is
so freaking cute.

03:22.245 --> 03:23.246
It's really, really, pretty.

03:23.246 --> 03:24.421
Very mellow and chill.

03:24.421 --> 03:25.553
Wait, darling,
let me get your seat.

03:25.553 --> 03:26.902
You're gonna be very
sur-- my seat?

03:26.902 --> 03:27.990
Oh, that's what you do
on dates?

03:27.990 --> 03:29.513
- Yeah.
- Oh, boy, bye.

03:29.513 --> 03:30.427
So, the guy pulls out--
oh, but y'all did not do that.

03:30.427 --> 03:31.602
Do somethin' new.

03:31.602 --> 03:32.864
Now, you're pushing
up the seat in.

03:32.864 --> 03:33.952
Yeah.

03:33.952 --> 03:35.171
You showing off
for your, chile.

03:35.171 --> 03:36.259
My bad.
Whatever the lady's want,

03:36.259 --> 03:37.347
you know,
I'm the player.

03:37.347 --> 03:38.827
I'm paying,
so just do it, you know.

03:38.827 --> 03:39.784
Okay, got it.

03:39.784 --> 03:41.264
Do it.
You know what I mean?

03:41.264 --> 03:42.483
- I'll do the truffle fries.
- I'll just have a salad.

03:42.483 --> 03:44.572
The arugula salad
and some brussels.

03:44.572 --> 03:46.182
What do you recommend
for drinks?

03:46.182 --> 03:47.270
Lemon drop martini.

03:47.270 --> 03:48.924
Lemon drop martini
it is then.

03:48.924 --> 03:50.317
I'll have
the Marta Express.

03:50.317 --> 03:52.362
I'll do a
Tito's and grapefruit.

03:52.362 --> 03:53.842
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

03:53.842 --> 03:56.497
You guys have no idea
how much I needed this.

03:56.497 --> 03:59.282
Tye and Justin is like
my right and my left hand.

03:59.282 --> 04:01.023
They're my boyfriend
and girlfriend,

04:01.023 --> 04:02.198
my mom and dad.

04:02.198 --> 04:03.330
Thank you.
That's so sexy.

04:03.330 --> 04:04.592
That's so pretty.

04:04.592 --> 04:06.246
Since I have custody
of the boys,

04:06.246 --> 04:07.638
I just saw another side
of them.

04:07.638 --> 04:09.510
They just became
my village.

04:09.510 --> 04:11.773
Cheers to--
- Cheers to a manhunt.

04:11.773 --> 04:13.165
A manhunt.

04:13.165 --> 04:14.689
Y'all better not have
no damn guys coming here.

04:14.689 --> 04:16.038
I made a flier.

04:16.038 --> 04:17.213
You better not
made no damn flier.

04:17.213 --> 04:19.215
I put it on Instagram,
and I ran an ad.

04:19.215 --> 04:20.912
Y'all better not have
no damn guys--

04:20.912 --> 04:22.740
I was coming here
to unwind.

04:24.133 --> 04:25.526
What's your criteria?

04:25.526 --> 04:27.876
I do want a man who knows
how to make me smile.

04:27.876 --> 04:29.530
- What makes you smile?
- I don't know.

04:29.530 --> 04:31.227
I ain't smiled
in a long damn time.

04:31.227 --> 04:33.229
To be honest,
I'm really nervous

04:33.229 --> 04:34.274
about dating.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.449
Michael and William
are so used

04:35.449 --> 04:36.928
to all of
my attention now.

04:36.928 --> 04:38.147
Thank you.
- Thank you.

04:38.147 --> 04:39.148
He's really gonna
have to be that guy

04:39.148 --> 04:40.541
to come in
and balance it.

04:40.541 --> 04:42.412
What if they touch
on my butt or somethin'?

04:42.412 --> 04:43.674
That might feel good.

04:43.674 --> 04:45.154
You might wanna let them
touch on your butt.

04:45.154 --> 04:47.069
No, I may go crazy then.

04:47.069 --> 04:48.810
- Don't have expectations.
- Yeah, it's just dating.

04:48.810 --> 04:50.638
It's just flirting.
- A date is adult time

04:50.638 --> 04:52.509
away from Michael
and William.

04:52.509 --> 04:53.510
We'll talk about
that later.

04:53.510 --> 04:54.990
- Right.
- The bigger issue is,

04:54.990 --> 04:57.035
now that this girl, Courtney,
invited all the girls

04:57.035 --> 04:58.559
and I to our
first gathering,

04:58.559 --> 05:00.691
it's all of us together.
- Mm-hmm.

05:00.691 --> 05:03.390
I just pray and hope
that it all comes together.

05:03.390 --> 05:04.826
- Yeah.
- Long story short,

05:04.826 --> 05:06.828
Drew been runnin'
her mouth to damn Kenya,

05:06.828 --> 05:08.090
going to Birmingham.

05:08.090 --> 05:09.570
Somebody was saying
that it was a fight

05:09.570 --> 05:11.572
between Drew and Marlo.

05:11.572 --> 05:14.401
She was just
very upset with Drew.

05:14.401 --> 05:15.750
So, I know
the story got told

05:15.750 --> 05:16.881
totally different
than what happened.

05:16.881 --> 05:18.927
- Right, right.
- At Drew's concert,

05:18.927 --> 05:21.582
when Drew said,
"Kandi, about the incident,"

05:21.582 --> 05:24.585
bitch, Kandi gave that bitch
a look like...

05:24.585 --> 05:25.847
"Don't you goddamn
talk about my business."

05:25.847 --> 05:27.152
Like be quiet.
Right, right, right, right.

05:27.152 --> 05:28.284
This is the mafia
over here, bitch.

05:28.284 --> 05:29.590
You will be annihilated.
- Right.

05:29.590 --> 05:32.332
Um, there was, like,
a incident with the staff

05:32.332 --> 05:33.507
or something.
- They're fine.

05:33.507 --> 05:34.464
You're talking about
the shooting

05:34.464 --> 05:35.987
that happened at Blaze?

05:35.987 --> 05:38.294
This bitch using synonyms,

05:38.294 --> 05:41.166
um, the incident,
the situation.

05:41.166 --> 05:42.429
Just saying
she chooses her words

05:42.429 --> 05:43.691
when it comes to Kandi.
- Yes, like--

05:43.691 --> 05:45.432
- It's not cool.
- You can't talk about this.

05:45.432 --> 05:46.563
You can't mention this.

05:46.563 --> 05:48.304
Kandi, you can't
pick and choose

05:48.304 --> 05:49.610
and just use the platform

05:49.610 --> 05:51.481
for goddamn advertisement
for your businesses.

05:51.481 --> 05:53.048
There was a goddamn
shooting all over the news.

05:53.048 --> 05:54.484
Why didn't you ask them
about the shooting?

05:54.484 --> 05:56.312
So, if you wanna choose
your words for one person,

05:56.312 --> 05:57.400
choose 'em for everybody,

05:57.400 --> 05:59.359
or let's just be real
and be raw.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.882
What did you
tell Drew, though?

06:00.882 --> 06:02.710
I'm like, "Drew, we need
to hold Kandi accountable."

06:02.710 --> 06:04.581
- Right.
- And she's just talking.

06:04.581 --> 06:06.235
We're yelling
back and forth.

06:06.235 --> 06:07.279
I'm like,
"Drew, okay, I'm--

06:07.279 --> 06:08.324
I'm gonna let you speak."
- Mm-hmm.

06:08.324 --> 06:09.630
Sharon would be
so proud of me.

06:09.630 --> 06:11.371
I'm sitting there.
- You're active listening.

06:11.371 --> 06:14.374
- Active listening.
- Perfect.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.114
And next thing
you know, after that,

06:16.114 --> 06:17.289
I went to talking.

06:17.289 --> 06:18.290
The only thing I remember
is this bitch

06:18.290 --> 06:19.422
just kept talking,
kept talking,

06:19.422 --> 06:20.902
would not let me talk.
- Uh-huh.

06:20.902 --> 06:23.295
I don't know
what the hell happened.

06:23.295 --> 06:25.950
My nephew is dead.
My blood nephew is dead.

06:25.950 --> 06:27.474
You're talking about acting.
- But feel-- but if--

06:27.474 --> 06:29.780
No, you're acting, though.
My-- you!

06:29.780 --> 06:31.347
And it's weird.
- Oh, you thought about Quentin.

06:31.347 --> 06:32.696
- Quentin, yeah.
- Quentin-- but what's crazy,

06:32.696 --> 06:35.656
y'all, I don't even know
what made me say it,

06:35.656 --> 06:38.876
but it was like the shooting,
Kandi not acknowledging it.

06:38.876 --> 06:40.791
It just took me back
to two years ago.

06:40.791 --> 06:42.184
She's acknowledging
what's going on

06:42.184 --> 06:44.360
at Kandi's restaurant,
but she's sidestepping it,

06:44.360 --> 06:45.753
and then maybe
it just triggered

06:45.753 --> 06:47.102
what you felt about
not being acknowledged

06:47.102 --> 06:48.538
with Quentin.
- Right.

06:48.538 --> 06:49.670
What did your sister
think about that?

06:49.670 --> 06:51.541
So, oh, chile,
you know, that-- my--

06:51.541 --> 06:53.935
you know, too, Tye.
- I know her.

06:53.935 --> 06:56.633
When my nephew passed,
my family was shocked

06:56.633 --> 06:58.243
that Kandi
didn't do anything.

06:58.243 --> 06:59.244
They thought I was lying.

06:59.244 --> 07:00.681
What would you have said?

07:00.681 --> 07:02.422
I'm sorry.
What can I do?

07:02.422 --> 07:04.119
How could I help
the family?

07:05.555 --> 07:07.601
Sweetie, don't cry.
She was raised with him.

07:07.601 --> 07:08.645
Your family is the one

07:08.645 --> 07:10.342
who said something to you
about it.

07:10.342 --> 07:11.953
- Girl, it's sad because--
- Like, I remember
the whole thing.

07:11.953 --> 07:13.955
I mean, sh--,
I was low-key jealous.

07:13.955 --> 07:15.826
Like, damn, I'm the one
taking care of y'all.

07:15.826 --> 07:16.827
Y'all have
an intimate enough--

07:16.827 --> 07:18.089
at that time, relationship.

07:18.089 --> 07:19.874
Listen, I've known Kandi
over ten years.

07:19.874 --> 07:21.353
But, at that time,
y'all had the type

07:21.353 --> 07:24.444
of relationship where
it would be a flowers to you.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.228
Girl, you're supposed
to call my sister.

07:26.228 --> 07:28.186
You're supposed
to cater with OLG.

07:28.186 --> 07:29.449
You're an action person.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.711
Like, when I was in labor,
you were, like,

07:30.711 --> 07:32.713
outside of the hospital
like, "Park here!"

07:32.713 --> 07:34.410
Now, I understand
she might not have known him

07:34.410 --> 07:35.542
personally.
- Mm-hmm.

07:35.542 --> 07:37.544
But if you run a business,

07:37.544 --> 07:39.459
and you lose an employee,
you send a card.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.982
You send condolence.
- Tragic like that, too.

07:40.982 --> 07:41.852
You send a flower.

07:43.288 --> 07:45.943
Mm-hmm.

07:45.943 --> 07:47.292
It just came out.

07:47.292 --> 07:48.685
Because you're doing your
life coach lessons

07:48.685 --> 07:50.034
and stuff like that,

07:50.034 --> 07:51.296
so maybe that's just, like,
helping you, like,

07:51.296 --> 07:52.254
connect dots and stuff.
- Somethin' like--

07:52.254 --> 07:53.342
Lock in some stuff, right?

07:53.342 --> 07:54.386
'Cause it's like
here you go again

07:54.386 --> 07:56.476
not being acknowledged.
I get it.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.738
It takes somebody
that really knows you

07:57.738 --> 07:59.130
and understands you
to get it.

07:59.130 --> 08:01.350
Maybe I'm being
a cry-baby that don't cry.

08:01.350 --> 08:03.004
Quentin was loud.

08:03.004 --> 08:07.008
Memphis Mac they called him,
and then they said he was gone.

08:07.008 --> 08:09.532
When I talked to Kandi,
I saw how she skipped over it

08:09.532 --> 08:12.317
like it was irrelevant.

08:12.317 --> 08:13.580
It's Kandi Burruss.

08:13.580 --> 08:16.017
You be quiet
and keep it moving,

08:16.017 --> 08:17.409
and that's what I did.

08:17.409 --> 08:18.672
But y'all never had, like,
a full conversation.

08:18.672 --> 08:19.673
No, that was that, chile.
I don't know.

08:19.673 --> 08:22.110
Okay.
I think go have fun.

08:22.110 --> 08:24.155
Have a cute girls' day
or whatever like that.

08:24.155 --> 08:26.157
Let's come and just
act like mature adults.

08:26.157 --> 08:27.463
- Right, put it away.
- Right.

08:27.463 --> 08:29.247
Keep the good energy!

08:29.247 --> 08:31.293
Right.
I'm not even worried.

08:31.293 --> 08:32.816
Coming up next...

08:32.816 --> 08:35.602
The gaping hole that is
going to be in this household

08:35.602 --> 08:37.908
when we leave,
is going to be appalling.

08:37.908 --> 08:38.953
You told me
you're leaving, regardless.

08:38.953 --> 08:40.520
- No, that's the truth.
- I am.

08:44.088 --> 08:45.916
♪ I'm I'm I'm trying to
stack up my paper ♪

08:45.916 --> 08:48.440
♪ the only time
when they holler ♪

08:48.440 --> 08:49.833
♪ is when they need you
for favors ♪

08:51.182 --> 08:54.185
Shazi, you brought us
a little food and patty.

08:54.185 --> 08:55.665
- There's no more patty.
- There's no more patty?

08:55.665 --> 08:57.188
You bought us
one patty each.

08:57.188 --> 08:59.582
That's what you asked for.

08:59.582 --> 09:01.671
Shari, you go to the store
and buy one patty?

09:01.671 --> 09:02.846
That is what
you asked me for.

09:02.846 --> 09:04.413
I'm going to make
a salad.

09:04.413 --> 09:05.457
Why?

09:05.457 --> 09:06.458
Because I ate
one of the patty.

09:06.458 --> 09:07.851
Oh, the patty
was your dinner?

09:07.851 --> 09:09.461
The patty was my dinner.

09:09.461 --> 09:10.854
Yeah, the patty
was my dinner.

09:10.854 --> 09:12.203
Slade, you would think
she would bring

09:12.203 --> 09:13.640
more than one patty, right?

09:14.728 --> 09:15.555
She should've
brought five.

09:15.555 --> 09:16.773
Yeah.

09:16.773 --> 09:21.473
Anyway, Shazi,
in this week's amazing news,

09:21.473 --> 09:26.391
Mom-- MommiNation is gonna
be on Belk.com--

09:26.391 --> 09:27.784
Belk.com.

09:27.784 --> 09:29.612
Okay, that is amazing.

09:29.612 --> 09:31.962
Belk is an online brand
that reaches

09:31.962 --> 09:35.052
over 17 million people a month.

09:35.052 --> 09:37.446
So, they reached out to us
to carry our merch

09:37.446 --> 09:39.274
on their website,
and it's huge.

09:39.274 --> 09:41.058
But the issue is, you know,
I be having family members

09:41.058 --> 09:42.582
that have been
quitting on me, lately,

09:42.582 --> 09:44.540
so I don't know
if I can depend on...

09:46.498 --> 09:48.500
Tyrell quit.
- Did I do something?

09:48.500 --> 09:50.328
Chile, you done made
my assistant quit.

09:50.328 --> 09:52.461
You know, there are
some of us you can depend on.

09:52.461 --> 09:53.810
So...

09:53.810 --> 09:54.985
I feel like, obviously,
I might have offended you

09:54.985 --> 09:56.421
a little bit
when I told you

09:56.421 --> 09:57.814
what Ross was thinking.

09:57.814 --> 10:01.122
You know, he's ready for us
to just be us again.

10:01.122 --> 10:04.952
I was shocked to hear that
coming from Ross

10:04.952 --> 10:08.825
'cause I feel like
the setup works best for y'all.

10:08.825 --> 10:10.087
No, and Shez, you know,

10:10.087 --> 10:11.480
if nobody
is not paying attention,

10:11.480 --> 10:13.656
I'm like you realize we got,
like, live-in nanny

10:13.656 --> 10:15.310
and help, like,
that we're not paying for.

10:15.310 --> 10:16.659
Right.

10:16.659 --> 10:17.747
I don't wanna be selfish,

10:17.747 --> 10:20.010
but I could be in Atlanta
on Monday,

10:20.010 --> 10:22.796
in New York on Friday,
in L.A. on Sunday,

10:22.796 --> 10:25.102
and knowing that my son
is always at home,

10:25.102 --> 10:26.887
always has someone
that's family,

10:26.887 --> 10:29.933
that I know loves him so much,
it works so well for me.

10:29.933 --> 10:31.761
I think sometimes Ross
does not think about

10:31.761 --> 10:34.459
all of the logistics.
- He leaves.

10:34.459 --> 10:36.723
Brah, he's supposed to be
getting me pregnant, baby.

10:36.723 --> 10:38.768
We done missed
four cycles, chile.

10:38.768 --> 10:40.465
I'm like, how is it
supposed to work?

10:40.465 --> 10:41.858
It don't.

10:41.858 --> 10:43.773
Ross is one of those people
who just feels like

10:43.773 --> 10:46.776
all of this is extra,
and it's not necessary.

10:46.776 --> 10:48.865
Right, and they'll
figure it out.

10:48.865 --> 10:51.389
Okay, which is true.

10:51.389 --> 10:54.088
I think that I need to have
a conversation with Rossie

10:54.088 --> 10:56.786
about, like,
a realistic timeline.

10:56.786 --> 10:58.092
We're gonna leave, regardless.

10:58.092 --> 10:59.354
Yeah, the Gatewoods
are leaving for sure.

10:59.354 --> 11:00.442
We're leaving, regardless.

11:02.226 --> 11:04.315
It's a little unsettling
to be kicked out,

11:04.315 --> 11:07.536
but sometimes I think it's time
to go off in the sunset

11:07.536 --> 11:10.713
and enjoy life.
So, I go back and forth.

11:10.713 --> 11:11.801
I don't think I gotta
fight too hard

11:11.801 --> 11:14.108
for just y'all to stay.

11:14.108 --> 11:16.327
It's really funny
that you say that.

11:16.327 --> 11:19.330
The gaping hole that
is going to be in this household

11:19.330 --> 11:22.725
when we leave, just us,
that you don't wanna fight for,

11:22.725 --> 11:24.205
is going to be appalling.

11:24.205 --> 11:26.163
You told me
you're leaving, regardless.

11:26.163 --> 11:28.122
- I am. I am.
- That's the truth.

11:28.122 --> 11:29.253
So, I'm just saying,
if you're leaving,

11:29.253 --> 11:31.821
what am I fighting for?

11:31.821 --> 11:34.258
I just think
we're just the coolest bunch.

11:34.258 --> 11:35.912
I think so, too.

11:38.001 --> 11:41.004
You're tired
a little bit?

11:43.746 --> 11:46.009
It did 'cause
now you have this gap there,

11:46.009 --> 11:47.445
right?

11:47.445 --> 11:48.577
Can you see if Slade's
mac and cheese is in there?

11:48.577 --> 11:49.534
I can't remember
if I put it in or not.

11:49.534 --> 11:51.188
I'm not looking
for nothing.

11:51.188 --> 11:52.624
Since you don't like being here,
you look for

11:52.624 --> 11:54.148
your own mac and cheese, chile.

11:54.148 --> 11:56.846
- All right now, okay.
- Bye, girl.

12:05.202 --> 12:06.682
- Look at that.
- This is cute.

12:06.682 --> 12:09.119
This is, like,
really big for me.

12:09.119 --> 12:11.034
This is, like,
a beautiful building.

12:11.034 --> 12:13.384
It's so pretty, isn't it?
It's so pretty.

12:13.384 --> 12:15.212
Here we go.

12:15.212 --> 12:17.780
- Wow.
- Ta-da!

12:17.780 --> 12:19.608
Oh, my God,
look at these ceilings.

12:19.608 --> 12:21.697
Okay.
- Kenya Moore Hair Spa!

12:22.742 --> 12:24.091
Wit' your hard hat, girl,

12:24.091 --> 12:25.745
I can't take you seriously
with that hat on.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.182
I want my guests at
the Kenya Moore Hair Spa

12:28.182 --> 12:31.707
to experience total luxury
from the hair care products

12:31.707 --> 12:33.056
to the atmosphere.

12:33.056 --> 12:35.972
This is going to be
my legacy for Brooklyn.

12:35.972 --> 12:38.845
There's gonna be valet
in the front, which I love.

12:38.845 --> 12:41.151
Now that I'm opening
my own salon,

12:41.151 --> 12:43.719
I can give myself some advice.

12:43.719 --> 12:46.635
There's gonna be
this beautiful white bar.

12:46.635 --> 12:48.071
- Right, the bar.
- It comes like this.

12:48.071 --> 12:49.681
I'm seeing it.
Okay, I'm seeing it.

12:49.681 --> 12:51.814
- Okay, six stations, right?
- Okay.

12:51.814 --> 12:54.730
Above the bar
will be this beautiful

12:54.730 --> 12:56.340
light installation.

12:56.340 --> 12:58.473
Okay, I'm seeing it, girl.
I'm seeing it.

12:58.473 --> 12:59.909
It's a vibe.

12:59.909 --> 13:01.781
When you walk into this space,
one should feel like

13:01.781 --> 13:06.437
they've entered a grand spa,
maybe heaven.

13:06.437 --> 13:10.093
There's so many things to do,
like permitting and contractors.

13:10.093 --> 13:11.616
So, how are you going to
make time for yourself

13:11.616 --> 13:12.748
and for dating
with all your...?

13:12.748 --> 13:13.749
I don't know.

13:13.749 --> 13:14.837
I've been a wife
for five years.

13:14.837 --> 13:15.838
Yeah.

13:15.838 --> 13:17.622
When I tell you
I'm lost in this,

13:17.622 --> 13:19.624
I am totally lost.
- Why?

13:19.624 --> 13:20.843
Because like...

13:20.843 --> 13:24.151
KMC is...
just a sweetheart.

13:24.151 --> 13:26.893
I actually started to feel like
I have feelings,

13:26.893 --> 13:28.459
but I don't know how to date.

13:28.459 --> 13:31.332
Roi is always out of town,
and I don't think

13:31.332 --> 13:33.508
that any relationship
can move forward

13:33.508 --> 13:36.511
if you don't see each other
on a consistent basis.

13:36.511 --> 13:38.818
Like, Marc was
a long distance relationship,

13:38.818 --> 13:40.515
and I married him
in seven months.

13:40.515 --> 13:42.082
And now Roi over a year,

13:42.082 --> 13:45.128
and we are no closer
to being married.

13:45.128 --> 13:48.131
When I like someone,
I'm so awkward.

13:48.131 --> 13:50.220
Embrace these moments
because you're, like,

13:50.220 --> 13:53.223
enjoying life,
and it's so much fun for you.

13:53.223 --> 13:54.834
I'm gonna be your Zen friend. Watch.

13:54.834 --> 13:55.965
Oh, yeah.
Thank you.

13:55.965 --> 13:57.314
Thank you for
looking for me.

13:57.314 --> 13:59.969
That's why I invited you
because, with my friends,

13:59.969 --> 14:01.884
the nastiness
never stops, right?

14:01.884 --> 14:03.233
Mm-hmm.

14:03.233 --> 14:05.845
One particular person
is a girl named Marlo.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.151
She's even
attacked my child.

14:08.151 --> 14:10.893
During that Alabama trip,
she was, like, banging

14:10.893 --> 14:12.939
and kicking at my door.

14:12.939 --> 14:14.288
She might be asleep.

14:14.288 --> 14:16.725
And Brooklyn woke up
screaming, "Mommy! Mommy,

14:16.725 --> 14:17.944
what's happened?
What's wrong?

14:17.944 --> 14:19.597
Mommy, I'm scared."

14:19.597 --> 14:21.164
She just makes up stuff.
- Mm-hmm.

14:21.164 --> 14:22.905
When you try to
defend yourself,

14:22.905 --> 14:24.951
she makes it seem like
she's a victim,

14:24.951 --> 14:26.517
and she's nobody's victim, girl.

14:26.517 --> 14:29.259
The only way Marlo could
get back in my good graces,

14:29.259 --> 14:31.914
is to renegotiate her deal
with the devil.

14:31.914 --> 14:34.177
She has done a lot of things
in her past.

14:34.177 --> 14:35.700
She slashed a girl's face.

14:35.700 --> 14:39.095
She went to jail for six months
over that incident,

14:39.095 --> 14:40.705
but here's the thing.

14:40.705 --> 14:44.361
I was going to be cordial,
but she's always coming for me.

14:44.361 --> 14:46.015
Listen, Kenya,
you need to pause, okay?

14:46.015 --> 14:47.060
You just--
you dropped too much on me.

14:47.060 --> 14:47.712
Yeah, I-I know.
I know. I-I know.

14:47.712 --> 14:48.931
I know. I know.

14:48.931 --> 14:50.280
The room is cold,
but the tea is hot.

14:52.413 --> 14:53.805
Coming up next...

14:53.805 --> 14:56.025
If she pop off,
do not grab me!

14:56.025 --> 14:57.200
Do not----ing grab me!
- I'm not.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.549
I'm not.
I'm not. I'm not.

14:58.549 --> 14:59.637
- I'm gonna--
- I'm not.

15:09.212 --> 15:10.518
What do you
think about this one?

15:10.518 --> 15:12.650
You don't like this one?
No comment?

15:14.304 --> 15:16.002
So, Kaleigh, Kairo and Alina
are coming over,

15:16.002 --> 15:17.220
and they're bringing Mecca.

15:17.220 --> 15:19.135
I got some cute activities
for us to do.

15:19.135 --> 15:21.268
This is her, uh, first--
her little handprint.

15:21.268 --> 15:22.965
- You love this.
- I do.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.227
I think she's a good baby.

15:24.227 --> 15:26.577
A lot of babies
cry a lot and...

15:30.842 --> 15:33.106
Gotti, calm yourself.

15:33.106 --> 15:35.978
- Hey, Mecca-Mecca.
- She is so cute.

15:35.978 --> 15:38.807
- Hey.
- Mm-hmm.

15:38.807 --> 15:40.200
Hey. Mmm.

15:40.200 --> 15:41.810
She cracking me up
trying to hold this bottle.

15:41.810 --> 15:42.942
She--
- Yeah.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.378
Hey, little baby.

15:44.378 --> 15:46.815
Kairo walks in.
He's just standing there.

15:46.815 --> 15:49.296
I'm like, what's up?

15:49.296 --> 15:52.908
And then he finally said,
"I have a baby on the way."

15:52.908 --> 15:54.997
Alina was already
four months pregnant,

15:54.997 --> 15:57.130
and so I totally felt like
I was behind

15:57.130 --> 15:58.479
preparing for the baby.

15:58.479 --> 16:01.047
I don't even think
it really, really resonated

16:01.047 --> 16:02.570
or hit-hit me yet.

16:02.570 --> 16:04.528
This is, like,
a little ornament thing

16:04.528 --> 16:06.008
that she put, like,
her handprint in.

16:06.008 --> 16:07.749
- Oh, yeah.
- That's so cute.

16:07.749 --> 16:08.750
- Isn't that cute?
- Mm-hmm.

16:08.750 --> 16:09.969
Mm-hmm.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.100
I'm about to go
put a shirt on, actually.

16:11.100 --> 16:13.102
- Oh, okay.
- I'll be right back.

16:13.102 --> 16:15.191
Kairo has definitely
stepped up.

16:15.191 --> 16:17.193
Yeah, he's so quick
to drop everything

16:17.193 --> 16:18.499
and tend to Mecca.

16:18.499 --> 16:20.327
I love seeing that
'cause I have friends

16:20.327 --> 16:22.068
that have kids,
and they don't have that.

16:22.068 --> 16:24.070
I have three kids.
I've never had that.

16:24.070 --> 16:25.549
Kairo will wake up
in the middle of the night,

16:25.549 --> 16:27.987
feed Mecca, change her diaper.
He clean.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.293
I had to do
all of that by myself.

16:30.293 --> 16:32.339
All right, so,
what are we doing first?

16:32.339 --> 16:33.383
I don't know.
You gotta read the instructions

16:33.383 --> 16:35.516
and figure out
how to do it.

16:35.516 --> 16:36.865
Can you burp her?
She just ate.

16:36.865 --> 16:38.040
Tell your daddy
I've been a mama

16:38.040 --> 16:40.042
three times over.

16:40.042 --> 16:42.044
Mecca, you gonna
burp for me?

16:42.044 --> 16:43.872
Well, all right then.

16:43.872 --> 16:45.221
Yeah.

16:45.221 --> 16:48.050
- How does it feel being a dad?
- Oh, it's cool.

16:48.050 --> 16:49.356
When she first came, though,
it was, like,

16:49.356 --> 16:51.184
we was not getting no sleep.

16:51.184 --> 16:53.142
She's probably at the age
where you can add, uh,

16:53.142 --> 16:54.709
a little--
- Whiskey.

16:54.709 --> 16:58.278
- Not whiskey-- cereal.
- Some Lucky Charms?

16:58.278 --> 17:00.193
No.

17:00.193 --> 17:02.151
There's little baby cereal.

17:02.151 --> 17:04.632
Last couple of nights,
she only woke up at, like, 7.

17:04.632 --> 17:07.069
- See you, Mecca.
- Where you going?

17:07.069 --> 17:09.071
- Oh, you're going, Kaleigh?
- Bye, little baby.

17:09.071 --> 17:10.116
What?

17:10.116 --> 17:11.465
Well, I have to
finish my work.

17:11.465 --> 17:13.423
- Kaleigh is on the clock.
- Bye, y'all.

17:13.423 --> 17:14.859
- See ya, Kaleigh.
- See ya.

17:14.859 --> 17:16.165
Bye.

17:16.165 --> 17:17.340
Oh, we are not about to
get no activity done.

17:17.340 --> 17:19.255
- Yeah, she's not gonna wake up.
- Okay.

17:19.255 --> 17:22.128
- Sleep like a baby.
- So, that is an ornament.

17:22.128 --> 17:23.651
Isn't that gonna be so cute?
- That's gonna be fun.

17:23.651 --> 17:25.827
It's gonna be so cute.

17:25.827 --> 17:27.089
Wet her hand a little bit.

17:27.089 --> 17:27.916
She's gonna wake up
when I wet it.

17:27.916 --> 17:29.265
No.

17:29.265 --> 17:33.443
Okay, she let go.
Okay, how you gonna do it?

17:33.443 --> 17:35.880
Oh, you're talking about
she ain't gonna wake up.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.230
Okay, it's wet.

17:37.230 --> 17:38.231
- Hold on.
- It's wet.

17:38.231 --> 17:39.580
You don't have to soak it.

17:39.580 --> 17:41.495
Kairo, you turn
that water off.

17:41.495 --> 17:43.105
I'm-I'm not
playing wit' you.

17:43.105 --> 17:44.019
Now, put her hand
right there.

17:44.019 --> 17:45.412
Push it down.

17:45.412 --> 17:46.761
Okay, so, hold on.
I'm gonna have to hold her.

17:46.761 --> 17:48.110
- Come down.
- Okay.

17:48.110 --> 17:50.765
Open that thing up,
right there.

17:50.765 --> 17:52.767
Open. Uh-oh.

17:52.767 --> 17:54.377
Push.
Push, little baby.

17:54.377 --> 17:58.033
Push.

17:58.033 --> 18:00.644
- Don't hurt her.
- I'm trying not to.

18:01.732 --> 18:04.257
He is so hands-on,
and I love it

18:04.257 --> 18:07.129
that I raised him
to be that type of person.

18:07.129 --> 18:08.609
Even though, you know,
when he first told me,

18:08.609 --> 18:10.263
I didn't feel like
he was ready,

18:10.263 --> 18:12.700
his actions are showing me
that he's more than ready...

18:15.572 --> 18:17.531
I'm sorry.

18:17.531 --> 18:19.533
- Sheree...
- Kairo is doing amazing.

18:26.627 --> 18:28.629
He really is.

18:28.629 --> 18:31.762
I can't believe
she stayed asleep.

18:31.762 --> 18:33.895
- That didn't come up.
- Wait, that--

18:33.895 --> 18:34.809
wait, hold on.
- Look at this.

18:34.809 --> 18:35.897
Move it. Move it.
Move it.

18:35.897 --> 18:37.464
Just make it like
a real finger.

18:37.464 --> 18:38.856
- What do you mean, "move it?"
- Squeeze it in.

18:38.856 --> 18:40.510
- It's over with.
- If you don't fix this thumb--

18:40.510 --> 18:41.859
you can fix it.
- No.

18:47.952 --> 18:49.693
Throw the ball.

18:49.693 --> 18:52.000
Yo.

18:52.000 --> 18:52.479
One more time.

18:52.479 --> 18:54.829
Come on.

18:54.829 --> 18:57.527
All right,
mommy is coming.

18:57.527 --> 18:59.181
Wait, Machai,
be careful, baby.

18:59.181 --> 19:02.184
She's sick.
She has the flu.

19:02.184 --> 19:03.838
Her temp was, like, 102.

19:03.838 --> 19:07.189
I don't like when
she's not feeling well.

19:10.758 --> 19:13.543
Get to the right.
Go back. Get it up.

19:14.762 --> 19:16.938
Come on, quick.

19:16.938 --> 19:18.113
Why you going one way?
You taking it easy on me?

19:18.113 --> 19:19.506
- Ooh, Jo-Jo.
- I ain't taking it easy.

19:19.506 --> 19:21.203
Ralph, please be
careful, honey.

19:21.203 --> 19:22.683
I don't need two patients.

19:22.683 --> 19:24.293
Hey, baby,
I'm built like iron.

19:24.293 --> 19:25.816
You know what I'm saying?
- No, your nose is running.

19:25.816 --> 19:27.209
I don't get sick.

19:27.209 --> 19:28.819
You've been sick
just probably as much as I have,

19:28.819 --> 19:30.604
and you've-- every time
I get a surgery,

19:30.604 --> 19:33.084
it's like you're in competition
'cause then you have a surgery.

19:33.084 --> 19:34.738
I've never had surgery.

19:34.738 --> 19:38.220
Ralph, you had
throat surgery, eye surgery,

19:38.220 --> 19:41.397
and you had-- surgery.

19:41.397 --> 19:42.877
- Oh.
- Oh, that part.

19:44.226 --> 19:47.316
Machai, let me see you
make a basket.

19:47.316 --> 19:50.145
Oh, my God, look at my--

19:50.145 --> 19:51.364
what should he be
working on?

19:51.364 --> 19:52.713
His jumping ability,
his footwork--

19:52.713 --> 19:54.236
them two can be great.
- Yeah?

19:54.236 --> 19:57.152
As an actress and child star--
can I say that,

19:57.152 --> 19:58.980
'cause she was
a child star--

19:58.980 --> 20:01.765
my parents really nurtured
and supported my determination

20:01.765 --> 20:04.115
to do what I've always
loved to do.

20:04.115 --> 20:05.291
- When we on again next?
- Thursday.

20:05.291 --> 20:06.944
Thursday?

20:06.944 --> 20:08.294
It is so important for me to
instill that back in my kids.

20:08.294 --> 20:11.122
You have to really nurture
their gifts and passions

20:11.122 --> 20:12.254
that they wanna
enter into.

20:12.254 --> 20:14.256
Future NBA players,
let's go.

20:14.256 --> 20:15.344
- Look, all right.
- All right, bro.

20:15.344 --> 20:16.345
I'll holler at you, man.
- Thank you.

20:16.345 --> 20:17.651
- All right, peace.
- Oh, God.

20:17.651 --> 20:19.305
No, but, seriously,
cousin Courtney--

20:19.305 --> 20:21.742
she invited everyone
to some escape room,

20:21.742 --> 20:25.746
but, at this point, I personally
don't wanna be around Marlo.

20:25.746 --> 20:28.575
It's like she's just coming,
trying to find a reason.

20:28.575 --> 20:30.490
I've seen Marlo blow up
at City Winery.

20:30.490 --> 20:33.493
So, yeah, I was just asking
Kandi how were things going

20:33.493 --> 20:36.278
with Kandi's cousin or nephew.
- Yeah, yeah, he got shot.

20:36.278 --> 20:37.584
- He did.
- He got shot, right?

20:37.584 --> 20:39.281
Yeah.
- But I'm from Chicago.

20:39.281 --> 20:42.589
We don't use that word
'cause when you say it,

20:42.589 --> 20:45.113
you are promoting
that type of behavior.

20:45.113 --> 20:46.854
It's like you have
to be sensitive.

20:46.854 --> 20:48.421
I'm just checking in to
make sure Kandi is good

20:48.421 --> 20:49.639
and her family is okay.
- Mm-hmm.

20:49.639 --> 20:51.641
Marlo felt like I was
letting her slide

20:51.641 --> 20:54.775
and then ended up saying that
her cousin or nephew

20:54.775 --> 20:58.692
ended up getting killed,
and he used to work at Blaze,

20:58.692 --> 21:00.781
and then Kandi did not
reach out to her

21:00.781 --> 21:02.957
and give her flowers.
- Wait, that's the situation?

21:02.957 --> 21:06.308
That's the situation that has
this woman coming at me.

21:06.308 --> 21:08.441
That is what
we're talking about.

21:08.441 --> 21:10.094
Pipe down, sis.

21:10.094 --> 21:11.357
Like, if you wanna ask Kandi,
you should have addressed her

21:11.357 --> 21:12.532
when she was here.

21:12.532 --> 21:13.707
She never shared this
with the group.

21:13.707 --> 21:15.796
You cannot attack
your friends

21:15.796 --> 21:19.365
because of
your unresolved trauma.

21:19.365 --> 21:22.759
It's so unfortunate that
instead of coming to say,

21:22.759 --> 21:24.544
"You know what,
this is what hurt me,

21:24.544 --> 21:26.894
"and I really wish you would
have done this or done that,"

21:26.894 --> 21:28.765
but, you know, you can't
even talk to her.

21:28.765 --> 21:30.637
I always gave Marlo
a million chances,

21:30.637 --> 21:32.029
and I really always
looked at her

21:32.029 --> 21:34.467
to be such a great person,
and a great friend,

21:34.467 --> 21:35.729
and a fun spirit.

21:35.729 --> 21:37.992
I now understand how
Kenya has been trying

21:37.992 --> 21:40.777
to get me to see Marlo
and her experience of Marlo.

21:40.777 --> 21:42.257
I'm like,
who are you, Marlo?

21:42.257 --> 21:43.737
Like, I don't understand
who you are.

21:43.737 --> 21:45.042
Yeah.

21:45.042 --> 21:47.306
Like, I really have to
extend some self-control

21:47.306 --> 21:49.525
'cause it could
go really left.

21:49.525 --> 21:51.397
She fitting to bring
Chicago all the way out

21:51.397 --> 21:53.268
'cause, you know, if you
touch me or provoke me,

21:53.268 --> 21:54.617
I feel like I could
I beat your ass.

21:54.617 --> 21:56.271
You're gonna beat Marlo?
Marlo a big one.

21:56.271 --> 21:58.186
You ain't never
seen me fight.

21:58.186 --> 22:00.188
I'm from Chicago, bitch.

22:00.188 --> 22:01.755
Coming up...

22:01.755 --> 22:04.279
Marlo cornered her, trying to
say there was an incident

22:04.279 --> 22:07.978
between someone
that worked for you

22:07.978 --> 22:10.372
and one of her nephews.

22:10.372 --> 22:12.026
Lying-ass bitch.

22:20.426 --> 22:22.471
Wait a minute.
What am I looking at?

22:22.471 --> 22:24.560
We really wanted to
walk you through the model,

22:24.560 --> 22:26.649
so you can kinda see how the
space looks and feels.

22:26.649 --> 22:29.696
Wow!

22:29.696 --> 22:31.611
How much for the buildout?

22:31.611 --> 22:33.395
It's like $300,000
to $400,000, probably.

22:33.395 --> 22:35.702
Ooh.

22:37.443 --> 22:39.009
So far,
so good with Martell.

22:39.009 --> 22:41.403
Are you getting more
than two pumps nowadays?

22:41.403 --> 22:42.970
- Two pumps?
- Yes, you know, two.

22:42.970 --> 22:44.493
In my moisturizer?

22:44.493 --> 22:46.756
I be cheerleading on
your cootch all the time.

22:46.756 --> 22:49.585
What's up?
- Oh, my God, Michele.

22:49.585 --> 22:51.587
Girl, don't act shy.

22:51.587 --> 22:53.459
Well, Miss Sharon said
you're journaling,

22:53.459 --> 22:54.764
and who wants
to share first?

22:54.764 --> 22:58.942
An area that makes
me happy is at school.

22:58.942 --> 23:00.944
I just wrote sometime I
think I truly don't know

23:00.944 --> 23:03.120
what happiness is,
but I know when I come home,

23:03.120 --> 23:05.601
and my boys are healthy,
when I see they're safe,

23:05.601 --> 23:07.777
I have a feeling of joy
and excitement.

23:07.777 --> 23:09.475
Okay, what's yours?
- What makes me happy,

23:09.475 --> 23:11.215
is being around
my family and friends.

23:11.215 --> 23:14.523
I feel comfort, love,
and just pure happiness.

23:14.523 --> 23:16.830
Give me a hug
and some love, buddy.

23:20.181 --> 23:21.269
Aww.

23:21.269 --> 23:22.444
Ahh!

23:33.499 --> 23:35.631
- What's up?
- What's up, baby?

23:35.631 --> 23:37.024
What you doin'?

23:37.024 --> 23:39.243
Going through the pitch
deck for the movie.

23:39.243 --> 23:40.680
Oh.

23:40.680 --> 23:43.117
Todd actually has
written multiple movies.

23:43.117 --> 23:46.555
This particular script
he's been working on

23:46.555 --> 23:48.775
for over a year,

23:48.775 --> 23:50.516
but we haven't
focused on it.

23:50.516 --> 23:51.908
Like, everything
has been focused on me,

23:51.908 --> 23:54.998
and so he needs
a Todd win.

23:54.998 --> 23:57.827
- Looking at the different--
- Character ideas.

23:57.827 --> 24:00.961
Character ideas and what type
of movie is it,

24:00.961 --> 24:02.397
yada, yada, yada.

24:02.397 --> 24:04.355
Got it. Well, now...

24:04.355 --> 24:05.835
What, Goldie?
- Goldie, calm down.

24:05.835 --> 24:08.359
The girl that I don't
really mess with...

24:09.491 --> 24:11.711
She invited us all
to come to--

24:11.711 --> 24:13.800
I think it's, like,
an escape room.

24:13.800 --> 24:15.497
I really didn't feel
like I should go,

24:15.497 --> 24:19.066
but Monyetta calls me earlier,
and she's going.

24:19.066 --> 24:22.199
So, I'm like, okay,
I guess I will go.

24:22.199 --> 24:23.244
That sound like fun.

24:23.244 --> 24:24.985
But it's like
a blast of paint.

24:24.985 --> 24:26.769
Oh, and if you don't get out,
it blasts you with paint

24:26.769 --> 24:28.205
or something?
- So, I don't--

24:28.205 --> 24:29.598
I don't really know,
but now I gotta find something

24:29.598 --> 24:31.078
that can get messed up.

24:31.078 --> 24:32.340
Right. So, you're
gonna do this gray.

24:32.340 --> 24:33.733
I was thinking
maybe the gray.

24:33.733 --> 24:35.256
I need to see what
Kenya gonna wear.

24:35.256 --> 24:37.214
Everybody is probably wearing,
like, a cute sweatsuit.

24:37.214 --> 24:38.564
You know how
y'all do it.

24:38.564 --> 24:41.218
- What?
- Hey!

24:41.218 --> 24:42.393
Look at you.

24:42.393 --> 24:44.787
She's at a party
for Brooklyn.

24:44.787 --> 24:47.964
Shamea, oh, you look so cute.
- Aww, what's up?

24:47.964 --> 24:49.966
I'm so mad
I couldn't go.

24:49.966 --> 24:51.533
Is Ace and Blaze
out there?

24:51.533 --> 24:55.711
I sent the kids, but I had
to get some other stuff done.

24:55.711 --> 24:57.234
Are you still gonna
be able to make it

24:57.234 --> 24:59.062
to Courtney's event later?

24:59.062 --> 25:01.412
She never put my name
on the text.

25:01.412 --> 25:04.024
And she didn't even tell us
that it was an event

25:04.024 --> 25:06.287
that we needed to wear,
like, sneakers.

25:06.287 --> 25:08.724
Monyetta said that we're
gonna have paint on us.

25:10.857 --> 25:12.728
I'm charging her for
any damage that's done

25:12.728 --> 25:14.121
to my gorgeous hair.

25:14.121 --> 25:16.471
This ain't mine,
but I'm gonna put a shower cap

25:16.471 --> 25:17.298
or somethin' over it.

25:22.259 --> 25:23.260
Yeah, I don't know.

25:38.624 --> 25:39.625
My nephew is dead

25:39.625 --> 25:41.714
and used to work
at her restaurant.

25:41.714 --> 25:43.759
She was saying that
her nephew was shot

25:43.759 --> 25:46.196
at the restaurant.
Like, I wasn't clear.

25:46.196 --> 25:48.242
He used to work
at her restaurant.

25:48.242 --> 25:49.939
Her-her thing is that,

25:49.939 --> 25:51.593
"My nephew worked
at your restaurant,

25:51.593 --> 25:53.769
"and you didn't
even send flowers.

25:53.769 --> 25:55.728
And I really didn't get
the full details,

25:55.728 --> 25:58.165
but he ended up passing.

25:58.165 --> 25:59.819
I do remember she
said something about

25:59.819 --> 26:02.822
one of her family members
that had worked for me,

26:02.822 --> 26:06.260
but it didn't have nothing to do
with us or anybody else

26:06.260 --> 26:07.391
that worked with us.

26:10.525 --> 26:13.310
And you didn't
send flowers.

26:13.310 --> 26:14.485
What?

26:14.485 --> 26:16.183
She's been around here
laughing with me,

26:16.183 --> 26:19.099
kiki'ing with me--
never mentioned that.

26:19.099 --> 26:21.449
Never did I hear this
story about the-the person

26:21.449 --> 26:23.930
was supposedly working
for me that killed him.

26:23.930 --> 26:27.803
Sounds like Marlo
is trying to amp up

26:27.803 --> 26:30.153
an already negative situation
that happened to

26:30.153 --> 26:33.504
one of my family members
to tear down our business,

26:33.504 --> 26:35.506
lying-ass bitch.

26:35.506 --> 26:37.683
She just wants to try to
get people to turn on you.

26:37.683 --> 26:39.728
So, I'll be there
for you, okay?

26:39.728 --> 26:40.903
All right, thank you.

26:40.903 --> 26:42.252
Okay, I love you.
See you soon.

26:42.252 --> 26:43.906
Love you, too. Mmm.

26:43.906 --> 26:46.517
- Don't.
- Mmm. Mmm!

26:46.517 --> 26:47.736
Oh, now she done
pissed me off.

26:47.736 --> 26:49.129
- Yeah.
- I'm like, girl,

26:49.129 --> 26:50.739
if you don't get outta here
acting like somebody

26:50.739 --> 26:52.828
was supposed to be, like,
really paying attention

26:52.828 --> 26:54.787
to everything
went on with you.

26:54.787 --> 26:56.963
Like, what is Marlo on?

26:56.963 --> 26:58.399
She's on some bullsh--.

26:58.399 --> 27:01.532
- She is so full of sh--.
- Go shut that sh-- down.

27:01.532 --> 27:03.665
She just want attention.

27:03.665 --> 27:04.884
Coming up next...

27:04.884 --> 27:06.320
I'm fitting to tell
you what the

27:06.320 --> 27:07.451
I'm telling you, right now!

27:07.451 --> 27:08.757
Oh, wait a minute.
Hold on. Hold on.

27:08.757 --> 27:09.932
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:09.932 --> 27:10.933
You ain't gonna
tell me sh--!

27:10.933 --> 27:12.805
Yes, the I am!

27:15.982 --> 27:18.419
♪ Ha ha

27:18.419 --> 27:20.290
♪ let's go

27:20.290 --> 27:22.423
♪ all right all right
all right all right ♪

27:22.423 --> 27:23.816
♪ ha ha oh oh

27:23.816 --> 27:24.991
You have to go
back and forth across--

27:24.991 --> 27:26.209
Is this
who I think it is?

27:26.209 --> 27:27.776
It is!
- Hey!

27:27.776 --> 27:29.169
All right, this
is my cousin.

27:29.169 --> 27:31.388
I don't wanna be walking up
on the wrong person.

27:31.388 --> 27:32.825
Hi, baby.
- Hi.

27:32.825 --> 27:34.130
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

27:34.130 --> 27:35.697
I feel like I haven't
seen you in forever.

27:35.697 --> 27:38.091
- You're looking good.
- Thank you.

27:38.091 --> 27:40.615
Oh, my God, I feel like
I haven't seen you forever.

27:40.615 --> 27:42.182
- How is my cousin?
- He's good.

27:42.182 --> 27:44.271
I appreciated you
putting this together.

27:44.271 --> 27:46.142
- Yes.
- So, you're really smart

27:46.142 --> 27:48.623
because in order for us
to get out of the room,

27:48.623 --> 27:49.885
we have to work together.

27:49.885 --> 27:51.060
Together, yes.

27:51.060 --> 27:54.107
In light of continuing
the positivity,

27:54.107 --> 27:56.762
we're gonna rely on each other
to get through.

27:56.762 --> 27:58.459
All right, ladies,
it's time to have

27:58.459 --> 27:59.678
some pregame drinks.

27:59.678 --> 28:01.462
Will we still be
competitive, though?

28:01.462 --> 28:03.943
As long as you each have
the same number of drinks, yes.

28:03.943 --> 28:05.422
- Okay.
- Yay, we can work--

28:05.422 --> 28:06.641
We can be here, honey.

28:06.641 --> 28:08.208
What can go wrong?

28:10.776 --> 28:12.821
Hey!
- Girl.

28:12.821 --> 28:14.127
Hey, darling,
how are you, beautiful?

28:14.127 --> 28:15.041
Hi, sweetie.
Fine, how are you doing?

28:15.041 --> 28:17.260
Hey, Drew.
- Beautiful, yes.

28:18.609 --> 28:19.741
Where's the restroom?

28:19.741 --> 28:22.396
- Um, back in that corner.
- Hey, Drew.

28:22.396 --> 28:23.789
Oh, you're gonna--
- Back to the left.

28:23.789 --> 28:25.399
I'll find it.

28:25.399 --> 28:26.835
What's that face for?

28:26.835 --> 28:28.619
The last time
I saw this lady,

28:28.619 --> 28:29.969
she was literally
attacking me.

28:29.969 --> 28:32.319
My blood nephew is dead,

28:32.319 --> 28:33.624
and you're talking about acting.
- Feel-- but feel--

28:33.624 --> 28:34.843
but if-- but feel my--
- No, you acted, though.

28:34.843 --> 28:36.149
My-- you!

28:36.149 --> 28:38.760
My nephew is dead, bitch!
- Girl...

28:38.760 --> 28:39.935
You haven't talked
to her since then?

28:39.935 --> 28:41.241
I have not.

28:41.850 --> 28:43.983
Oh, muah, you smell good.

28:43.983 --> 28:45.811
Hey, I am back.

28:45.811 --> 28:46.942
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, Monyetta.

28:46.942 --> 28:47.987
Hello.
How are you, Marlo?

28:47.987 --> 28:49.075
- You look cute.
- Thank you.

28:49.075 --> 28:50.337
We're back
from Birmingham.

28:50.337 --> 28:52.034
- Yes.
- Yes, positive vibes--

28:52.034 --> 28:53.340
positive vibes.
- Thank God, right?

28:53.340 --> 28:54.863
That's what I'm
saying, Monyetta.

28:54.863 --> 28:56.865
We ended on a-a good
kumbaya moment,

28:56.865 --> 28:58.388
so that's all that matters.

28:58.388 --> 28:59.694
- It is.
- That's all that matters.

28:59.694 --> 29:00.739
That's all that matters.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.001
- Okay.
- Thank you for coming.

29:02.001 --> 29:04.046
Well, hello.

29:07.006 --> 29:09.008
Hey, Sanya!

29:09.008 --> 29:10.792
Sheree, how is Martell?
Tell him I said hey.

29:10.792 --> 29:12.098
She wants to tell
you guys somethin'.

29:12.098 --> 29:14.448
- What?
- She's expecting.

29:16.015 --> 29:18.278
Wait, wait,
that is a crazy tripping.

29:18.278 --> 29:19.845
I don't know if you know,
but I have a grandbaby now.

29:19.845 --> 29:21.324
My son had a baby.
- Congratulations.

29:21.324 --> 29:24.023
- She's so-- she's so cute.
- How old?

29:24.023 --> 29:25.981
Three months.

29:25.981 --> 29:28.723
Hey, ladies!
How are yas?

29:28.723 --> 29:29.898
Hey, boo.

29:29.898 --> 29:31.595
- What do they call you?
- Gigi.

29:31.595 --> 29:32.596
- Gigi.
- It stands for

29:32.596 --> 29:34.816
gorgeous grandma, glama.

29:34.816 --> 29:36.383
- Yes.
- That's it. That's it.

29:36.383 --> 29:37.819
Oh, that's
my stepdaughter's name.

29:37.819 --> 29:39.299
Hey!

29:39.299 --> 29:40.779
What's up? What's up?
What's up?

29:40.779 --> 29:42.781
Hello.
- How are you? You good?

29:42.781 --> 29:45.566
- No.
- No?

29:45.566 --> 29:47.307
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

29:49.091 --> 29:51.441
Kandi walks in,
and, baby.

29:53.966 --> 29:58.753
Ooh, baby, you just
feel the energy shift.

30:00.276 --> 30:03.062
Hi, honey.
You don't sound happy.

30:03.062 --> 30:04.454
Looks like
everyone is here.

30:04.454 --> 30:06.326
Cheers to good times
and good vibes.

30:06.326 --> 30:07.718
Yes.

30:07.718 --> 30:10.112
I feel I got a lot of
positivity coming my way.

30:10.112 --> 30:12.201
Not today, Satan.

30:12.201 --> 30:14.595
Not today.

30:14.595 --> 30:16.466
All right, let me go check
to see where we have--

30:16.466 --> 30:18.947
let's see.
- I wanna get it started.

30:18.947 --> 30:21.167
Marlo, I have
to ask you a question

30:21.167 --> 30:24.213
'cause my energy ain't gonna
be right until I know.

30:24.213 --> 30:26.650
What is this about me
and your cousin?

30:26.650 --> 30:28.261
What were you saying?
- Um, you know what?

30:28.261 --> 30:29.871
Me, you, and Drew, can we
go somewhere and speak?

30:29.871 --> 30:30.916
- Sure.
- Yeah,

30:30.916 --> 30:31.917
'cause it was
the three of us.

30:31.917 --> 30:33.614
I am heated.

30:33.614 --> 30:35.442
You know, I don't have
a good poker face.

30:35.442 --> 30:36.835
I can't hide it.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.924
I can't control my emotions
like everybody else.

30:38.924 --> 30:40.229
I don't need
the whole peanut gallery

30:40.229 --> 30:41.883
for somethin' serious.

30:41.883 --> 30:43.754
Whatever she gives,
I'm gonna give.

30:43.754 --> 30:45.278
If she give
big Taurus energy,

30:45.278 --> 30:47.280
I'm gonna give
big Aquarius energy, bitch,

30:47.280 --> 30:48.934
and we're gonna
give them energies.

30:48.934 --> 30:50.631
What was said?
What did you get back?

30:50.631 --> 30:51.980
First, tell me that, please.

30:51.980 --> 30:54.940
Something about
you were upset with me--

30:54.940 --> 30:57.116
something about I didn't
send you flowers

30:57.116 --> 30:59.422
for your cousin or somethin'.
- My nephew--

30:59.422 --> 31:01.294
remember when we were sitting
there in the restaurant?

31:01.294 --> 31:03.122
Drew asked you about
the shooting at Old Lady Gang.

31:03.122 --> 31:05.124
She said, "Incident."

31:05.124 --> 31:07.430
Any other time
when all of us talking,

31:07.430 --> 31:09.345
if it's Marlo
stabbed a girl,

31:09.345 --> 31:12.000
Marlo slashed a girl,
Marlo is a convicted felon,

31:12.000 --> 31:15.264
Marlo is a whore,
everyone is so direct

31:15.264 --> 31:17.353
whenever they
say something about me.

31:17.353 --> 31:19.747
So, I came over, I said,
"Drew, I don't understand.

31:19.747 --> 31:22.793
When it comes to me,
no one sugarcoats anything.

31:22.793 --> 31:24.317
It's just said."

31:24.317 --> 31:26.928
Then Drew got upset
with something I said.

31:26.928 --> 31:28.147
I don't know, it went high.

31:28.147 --> 31:29.888
When she kept talking,
I stood up.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.846
I said, "Just shut
the up!

31:31.846 --> 31:33.195
My nephew got shot,

31:33.195 --> 31:35.241
and he used to work
at Kandi's place!"

31:35.241 --> 31:36.633
So, now listen, I know--
- Hold on.

31:36.633 --> 31:38.026
Wait, wait, wait.
Let me just finish

31:38.026 --> 31:39.288
'cause we're working on--
I'm working on listening.

31:39.288 --> 31:40.855
- Okay, I'm gonna listen.
- So, please.

31:40.855 --> 31:43.162
Two years ago, you remember
I was sitting at your house

31:43.162 --> 31:45.164
with Riley packing
before going to college,

31:45.164 --> 31:46.208
you know, I told you
about my nephew.

31:46.208 --> 31:47.993
You sent me a text
and asked me

31:47.993 --> 31:49.168
did I know your nephew.
- No, I-- no, but the day
before, though--

31:49.168 --> 31:50.517
No, wait listen,
I sent you a text,

31:50.517 --> 31:52.171
but, also, at your house
when we were packing

31:52.171 --> 31:54.303
for Riley's thing,
I came to you.

31:54.303 --> 31:56.262
I was so emotional
that day,

31:56.262 --> 31:57.350
but when I brought
it up to you,

31:57.350 --> 31:59.004
I could tell you
didn't wanna--

31:59.004 --> 32:00.092
you didn't wanna deal
with it.

32:00.092 --> 32:01.397
So, what I'm saying
here, Kandi--

32:01.397 --> 32:02.442
Hold on. Why would
I not wanna deal with it?

32:02.442 --> 32:03.530
I thought you
was gonna listen.

32:03.530 --> 32:04.966
Would you listen?
- Let's roll back.

32:04.966 --> 32:06.489
- Don't go do the fast talking.
- Let me tell you.

32:06.489 --> 32:08.100
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm not fast talking nothing.

32:08.100 --> 32:08.883
Okay, can I talk, though?
Can I tell you why I said it?

32:08.883 --> 32:10.493
Because you are
trying to attach

32:10.493 --> 32:11.581
your cousin's shooting to me.
- No, I'm not, no, I'm not.

32:11.581 --> 32:13.061
And it had nothin'
to do with me!

32:13.061 --> 32:15.194
Oh, my God, need to make sure
everything good.

32:15.194 --> 32:17.979
I told you he no longer
worked with us.

32:17.979 --> 32:20.634
So, I don't understand why
you're running it back to her

32:20.634 --> 32:22.984
as if his shooting
has something to do

32:22.984 --> 32:24.855
with me
and my damn restaurant.

32:24.855 --> 32:26.161
Don't do that!

32:26.161 --> 32:29.034
Anything she can use
to try to tear me down,

32:29.034 --> 32:30.557
she's just trying
to run with it,

32:30.557 --> 32:32.559
and I have a problem
with that.

32:32.559 --> 32:35.214
I'm not mad at you
for my nephew's death.

32:35.214 --> 32:37.216
Quentin wasn't working there
because of COVID.

32:37.216 --> 32:40.132
I'm mad at you because
you ignore things,

32:40.132 --> 32:42.656
and people allow you
to get away with it.

32:42.656 --> 32:44.005
Can I talk now?
- Actually, no, let me talk.

32:44.005 --> 32:45.528
- Go ahead, talk.
- No, you don't need to talk.

32:45.528 --> 32:46.573
Now, you can go now.
- No, I do need to talk

32:46.573 --> 32:47.791
because, at the end
of the day--

32:47.791 --> 32:49.228
So, Kandi, my nephew
did work with you.

32:49.228 --> 32:50.403
- What happened was--
- I have pictures with you--

32:50.403 --> 32:51.621
I have pictures with you
and him with Todd.

32:51.621 --> 32:53.014
What happened was
she came to me and--

32:53.014 --> 32:55.582
- My nephew--
- I-- he did work there.

32:55.582 --> 32:57.062
I never said he didn't.
- I know, but why--

32:57.062 --> 32:58.411
okay, can you go, Drew?
Just let me and Kandi talk.

32:58.411 --> 32:59.978
Monyetta, what's going on?

32:59.978 --> 33:01.240
It's heated.
I just don't--

33:01.240 --> 33:03.894
you know, I don't
like all that.

33:03.894 --> 33:05.200
Yeah, I don't know
what's going on.

33:05.200 --> 33:06.593
I think they need to
talk among themselves

33:06.593 --> 33:07.811
and figure--
and figure it out.

33:07.811 --> 33:09.683
That's a little
hot and heated, though.

33:09.683 --> 33:11.337
Monyetta, oh, my gosh.

33:11.337 --> 33:12.903
I couldn't figure it out.

33:12.903 --> 33:14.862
Everybody wants
to be a hero.

33:14.862 --> 33:16.124
Well, this took
a little pivot

33:16.124 --> 33:18.083
from what I was
expecting, ladies.

33:18.083 --> 33:19.867
No, my sister
called me crying.

33:19.867 --> 33:21.390
I text you.
- Ma'am,

33:21.390 --> 33:23.392
he stopped working with us
months before he got killed.

33:23.392 --> 33:25.481
So, then what does that say
about your character?

33:25.481 --> 33:27.353
What the-- what says
about my character?

33:27.353 --> 33:28.615
He didn't work for me.
- Kandi,

33:28.615 --> 33:31.661
y'all bring up sh--
from me 23 years ago.

33:31.661 --> 33:35.970
Two years ago, I tell you
my nephew used to work for OLG.

33:35.970 --> 33:37.276
- Okay.
- And he got shot

33:37.276 --> 33:38.712
by a guy that he met
at your restaurant.

33:38.712 --> 33:40.279
- That is not true--
- The guy he met--

33:40.279 --> 33:41.976
- Not-- he never--
- He said he met him

33:41.976 --> 33:43.456
at the restaurant.
- Well, I don't know
if he was a patron,

33:43.456 --> 33:44.979
but he never met
nobody that worked there.

33:44.979 --> 33:45.327
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
He just said he met--

33:46.633 --> 33:48.113
How would I--
how the--

33:48.113 --> 33:50.028
He got Christmas party
pictures with you all,

33:50.028 --> 33:52.117
pictures with just you.
- Hold on.

33:52.117 --> 33:53.683
Nobody said he
never worked there.

33:53.683 --> 33:55.076
- Okay, but-- no, but--
- What I'm telling you is--

33:55.076 --> 33:56.208
Hold on.
You do it all the time!

33:56.208 --> 33:57.426
He did not work
there for months!

34:00.734 --> 34:01.996
It's hard for me
to focus, though.

34:01.996 --> 34:03.867
Like, I feel sad
about this.

34:03.867 --> 34:05.347
- You-you are not gonna attach--
- You're not gonna try
to tell me sh--!

34:05.347 --> 34:06.435
I'm gonna tell you what
the I'm telling you,

34:06.435 --> 34:07.306
right now, bitch!
- I'm gonna tell--

34:07.306 --> 34:08.002
you're not gonna tell me
a----ing thing!

34:08.002 --> 34:09.351
Okay, okay, whoa.

34:09.351 --> 34:10.048
Oh, wait a minute.
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

34:10.048 --> 34:11.179
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:11.179 --> 34:12.441
You ain't gonna
tell me sh--, bitch!

34:12.441 --> 34:13.877
- Yes, the I am!
- What you gonna do?

34:13.877 --> 34:15.531
If you had a problem with it,
you should've said somethin'

34:15.531 --> 34:16.750
a long time ago!
- Yeah, Marlo.

34:16.750 --> 34:17.968
I did, that's why
I said you!

34:17.968 --> 34:19.405
That's what you
should have----ing did

34:19.405 --> 34:21.146
instead of trying to--
- Come on. Come on. Come on.

34:21.146 --> 34:22.190
No, no, come on.
No, no, no.

34:22.190 --> 34:23.496
Come on, Kandi.

34:23.496 --> 34:24.975
You should have
sent me flowers!

34:24.975 --> 34:28.109
You didn't care about
flowers when you text me

34:28.109 --> 34:30.024
a couple days later!

34:30.024 --> 34:31.243
- Come on.
- No.

34:31.243 --> 34:32.418
- No, no, Kandi.
- No.

34:32.418 --> 34:34.507
We're at a restaurant.
We're at a place.

34:34.507 --> 34:35.682
Everybody is making a scene.

34:35.682 --> 34:36.683
We're just trying
to separate you guys.

34:36.683 --> 34:38.119
- I know, I know.
- Let's just go.

34:38.119 --> 34:40.034
- Are you okay? Are you okay?
- It's not worth it.

34:40.034 --> 34:42.123
She's so aggressive.

34:42.123 --> 34:44.169
She's being aggressive.
She needs to go.

34:44.169 --> 34:46.171
She just needs to go.

34:46.171 --> 34:47.955
Take her outside.

34:47.955 --> 34:49.739
I don't understand why
Marlo is getting this rap

34:49.739 --> 34:51.437
like she was
the only one aggressive.

34:51.437 --> 34:52.829
I'm telling you,
right now--

34:52.829 --> 34:53.961
let me tell you somethin'.
- No, no, no. Come on.

34:53.961 --> 34:55.005
Let me tell you somethin'!

34:55.005 --> 34:56.616
If she pop off,
do not grab me!

34:56.616 --> 34:58.183
- I'm not. I'm not.
- Do not----ing grab me!

34:58.183 --> 34:59.358
- I'm not. I'm not.
- I'm gonna--

34:59.358 --> 35:01.055
- I'm not.
- I'm tellin' you, don't.

35:01.055 --> 35:02.926
She's a fake-ass bitch!

35:02.926 --> 35:04.450
No, your character
is over.

35:04.450 --> 35:06.147
Go cry now.
Go cry.

35:06.147 --> 35:07.540
The only reason
why I'm crying right now

35:07.540 --> 35:10.238
is because I can't----ing
choke your ass, bitch!

35:13.850 --> 35:16.201
The only reason
why I'm crying right now

35:16.201 --> 35:17.115
is because I can't----ing
choke your ass, bitch!

35:17.115 --> 35:19.117
Go cry.
Go cry, baby.

35:19.117 --> 35:20.379
This ain't going nowhere.

35:20.379 --> 35:21.945
Let's-let's go.
- Go cry, baby.

35:21.945 --> 35:23.295
Yeah, let's go.
Let's go.

35:23.295 --> 35:24.470
Let's go start the contest.
- Let's do a game.

35:24.470 --> 35:25.427
They know you can't
confront Kandi.

35:25.427 --> 35:27.037
Her character is awful,

35:27.037 --> 35:28.474
and she runs away.
- Girl!

35:28.474 --> 35:30.606
Her character is awful.

35:30.606 --> 35:32.347
Her character--
you cannot confront her.

35:32.347 --> 35:33.740
Oh, my God.

35:33.740 --> 35:36.438
This bitch is gonna
make me----ing act stupid.

35:36.438 --> 35:37.961
When Drew said that,
she was like--

35:37.961 --> 35:40.268
I was like, "Shut the hell up.
My nephew was shot,"

35:40.268 --> 35:41.530
or whatever.
- Oh!

35:41.530 --> 35:43.271
So, I didn't even know
it was bothering me

35:43.271 --> 35:44.403
'cause, guess what,
I'm like,

35:44.403 --> 35:45.534
Kandi, I'm like--
- Oh.

35:45.534 --> 35:46.666
Because you've never
talked about it.

35:46.666 --> 35:47.884
I have never known.
- I never talked.

35:47.884 --> 35:48.972
No, but listen,
she don't give a .

35:48.972 --> 35:50.191
She doesn't care.

35:50.191 --> 35:51.323
Before we talk about
some situations

35:51.323 --> 35:52.498
that happened at
my restaurant,

35:52.498 --> 35:53.629
let's talk about you
and your----ing--

35:53.629 --> 35:55.283
the way you sliced
that woman's face.

35:55.283 --> 35:56.676
Let's talk about that.

35:56.676 --> 36:00.070
People always wanna define
Marlo by her mugshot,

36:00.070 --> 36:03.161
but she's really
kind-hearted.

36:03.161 --> 36:04.597
She's a really
sweet person.

36:04.597 --> 36:06.555
I'm tired of her--
- I know.

36:06.555 --> 36:09.167
Coming to y'all and trying
to rally y'all against me.

36:09.167 --> 36:11.169
Yeah,
it's not happening.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.822
You're talking about 2020.
- 2020.

36:12.822 --> 36:14.824
All the times y'all have
been around each other,

36:14.824 --> 36:16.652
for us to not even ever
know this happened--

36:16.652 --> 36:18.001
- That is why I'm saying--
- It doesn't--

36:18.001 --> 36:19.481
- She be making up sh--.
- Because it's not real.

36:19.481 --> 36:21.396
- It is so crazy to me.
- It's not real.

36:21.396 --> 36:22.919
It's not a trigger.
- She makes up sh--.

36:22.919 --> 36:24.530
Let me just say this.
- She's done.

36:24.530 --> 36:26.532
On August 13th, she says,
"Kandi-yams, did you have--"

36:26.532 --> 36:28.273
Now, this is how she is.
"Kenya-yams--"

36:28.273 --> 36:29.665
- Yeah, that's nice. Yeah.
- That's nice.

36:29.665 --> 36:31.406
"Did you have a guy
named Quentin McNeil

36:31.406 --> 36:32.973
working for you
at Old Lady Gang?"

36:32.973 --> 36:34.627
I said, "I can't remember.
I will check."

36:34.627 --> 36:36.063
She said, "Please do."

36:36.063 --> 36:38.021
I said, "Yes, but he doesn't
work there anymore."

36:38.021 --> 36:40.720
Then she says, "Wow,
that was my nephew.

36:40.720 --> 36:41.808
He got killed
last night."

36:41.808 --> 36:43.244
So, her nephew
had just got killed,

36:43.244 --> 36:45.246
and she's
"Kandi-yams"-ing me.

36:45.246 --> 36:47.770
Five days later,
she is texting me

36:47.770 --> 36:49.250
about signing up--
- About Cameo.

36:49.250 --> 36:50.643
Through Cameo
through her.

36:50.643 --> 36:52.601
She said,
"Easy lunch money for you,

36:52.601 --> 36:53.907
if you've not
already signed up."

36:53.907 --> 36:55.256
Like, if you--

36:55.256 --> 36:56.214
She doesn't sound
too upset to me.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.519
Right.
Where is the issue?

36:57.519 --> 36:58.738
She's trying to make
a dollar off of Kandi.

36:58.738 --> 36:59.826
- No, 'cause you--
- Where is the issue?

36:59.826 --> 37:01.262
I don't care
when he didn't work,

37:01.262 --> 37:02.568
or you didn't--
- Like, why does

37:02.568 --> 37:03.743
that conversation
have to go there?

37:03.743 --> 37:04.613
- You know why.
- Why?

37:04.613 --> 37:05.919
It's Kandi Burruss.

37:05.919 --> 37:07.660
You always have to put her
in the best light.

37:07.660 --> 37:11.359
She never wants to be revealed
about anything that's negative.

37:11.359 --> 37:12.708
- I just--
- She ain't got no character.

37:12.708 --> 37:14.275
Her character went out
the window when she got--

37:14.275 --> 37:16.364
when she slashed
all those people's faces.

37:16.364 --> 37:17.670
That's so deep.
I don't--

37:17.670 --> 37:19.062
all Marlo has to do
is shift her body weight,

37:19.062 --> 37:20.194
and it's a fight.

37:20.194 --> 37:21.717
She was about
to fight Kandi.

37:21.717 --> 37:23.676
If Marlo is not going to keep
her hands to herself--

37:23.676 --> 37:25.286
She's so aggressive.

37:25.286 --> 37:27.984
She's being aggressive.
She needs to go.

37:27.984 --> 37:29.072
It's aggressive.

37:31.466 --> 37:33.512
Did I feel what?

37:33.512 --> 37:36.645
No, I didn't feel threatened
by Marlo at all.

37:36.645 --> 37:39.126
It had been so
much time to pass.

37:39.126 --> 37:40.867
Drew kept saying,
"She's violent. She's vi--"

37:40.867 --> 37:42.303
- Yeah.
- If you ever notice--

37:42.303 --> 37:43.913
- You put your hands--
- Whenever says something--

37:43.913 --> 37:44.914
- Behind your back. I saw you.
- I'm gonna do this or this.

37:44.914 --> 37:46.655
- Yeah.
- 'Cause they try and keep

37:46.655 --> 37:49.571
bringing up
23 years ago.

37:49.571 --> 37:51.225
When they talk,
"Oh, you stabbed a girl,

37:51.225 --> 37:53.401
you slashed a girl,
you're a convicted felon,"

37:53.401 --> 37:54.750
when it comes
to Kandi,

37:54.750 --> 37:57.144
it's "what happened
with the incident?"

37:57.144 --> 38:00.060
Bitch, it was a mother----ing
shooting on Fox News.

38:00.060 --> 38:01.975
Marlo never even gets
a question out

38:01.975 --> 38:04.586
without someone bringing up
her whole past

38:04.586 --> 38:05.892
and throwing it
in her face.

38:05.892 --> 38:08.111
Before we talk about
some situations

38:08.111 --> 38:09.722
that happened at my restaurant,
let's talk about you

38:09.722 --> 38:11.941
and your----ing-- the way
you sliced that woman's face.

38:11.941 --> 38:13.943
Her character went out
the window when she got--

38:13.943 --> 38:15.858
when she slashed all
those people's faces.

38:15.858 --> 38:17.120
It's disrespectful
as hell.

38:17.120 --> 38:19.122
I didn't even know
the sh-- bothered me

38:19.122 --> 38:20.907
and was gonna bother me.
- Let me-- I'm gonna--

38:20.907 --> 38:21.821
I'm gonna talk to Kandi.
I'll be right back.

38:21.821 --> 38:23.083
I don't know where I'm at.

38:23.083 --> 38:24.606
You gotta stop bottling
all that stuff up.

38:24.606 --> 38:27.043
Is she leaving?

38:27.043 --> 38:29.568
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry
that happened to you.

38:29.568 --> 38:32.397
Well, thanks, I guess.

38:32.397 --> 38:35.008
If you need anything,
call me, okay?

38:35.008 --> 38:36.966
Just know you held your own.
You were right.

38:36.966 --> 38:38.968
I love you, girl.
Give me a hug. I love you.

38:38.968 --> 38:40.709
Bye, Kandi.
Please have a good night.

38:40.709 --> 38:42.450
I'll call you later.
- I know. I know. I know.

38:42.450 --> 38:44.626
For me to wanna
threaten a person,

38:44.626 --> 38:48.108
I am not thinking
clearly whatsoever.

38:48.108 --> 38:50.632
I can't wit' you anymore.

38:50.632 --> 38:52.199
I don't understand
why the conversation

38:52.199 --> 38:53.374
had to get so heated.

38:53.374 --> 38:55.071
Because that's her--
that's her energy.

38:55.071 --> 38:56.812
The last time I saw Marlo,
she attacked me

38:56.812 --> 38:58.336
and was being
very aggressive,

38:58.336 --> 38:59.728
and it was nothing
to do with me.

38:59.728 --> 39:00.860
What was-- wait, why are
you saying-- why you--

39:00.860 --> 39:02.252
why do you think
she was attacking you?

39:02.252 --> 39:03.819
That's how this started,
is that she felt like

39:03.819 --> 39:05.430
I went easy on Kandi.
- From the time that

39:05.430 --> 39:07.997
we were at her thing, she--
- For calling it an incident.

39:07.997 --> 39:10.478
I'm from Chicago.
We don't use that word.

39:10.478 --> 39:12.001
For all the kids that
are on the South Side

39:12.001 --> 39:13.916
getting killed every day,
when you say that,

39:13.916 --> 39:15.483
it perpetuates it.
- Yeah.

39:15.483 --> 39:16.571
So, we don't use
that word.

39:16.571 --> 39:18.486
Um...

39:18.486 --> 39:20.401
Hmm.

39:20.401 --> 39:22.185
This is beyond a reach.

39:22.185 --> 39:24.318
Okay, no, I've never heard
that logic before.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.669
Explain it again, girl.

39:27.669 --> 39:29.149
I wish Drew would've
touched me, bitch.

39:29.149 --> 39:30.411
I was gonna fall down
on the ground

39:30.411 --> 39:32.587
and bust my head.

39:32.587 --> 39:34.415
Drew better sit her little
Mickey Mouse,

39:34.415 --> 39:37.462
built like a box ass down.

39:37.462 --> 39:39.681
That went too far, Sheree.
It went too far.

39:39.681 --> 39:41.379
Yeah, I even
gave her a chance.

39:41.379 --> 39:42.684
- You been a bamboozled, girl.
- What did I tell you?

39:42.684 --> 39:44.425
- You've been hoodwinked.
- What did I tell you?

39:44.425 --> 39:45.644
You have not
been hoodwinked.

39:45.644 --> 39:47.776
I think we should
go back in.

39:47.776 --> 39:49.038
- No, the trick gotta go.
- Marlo is not gonna--

39:49.038 --> 39:50.518
- The trick gotta go.
- Marlo is not gonna

39:50.518 --> 39:52.172
participate.

39:52.172 --> 39:54.827
How did we go from them
arguing about something

39:54.827 --> 39:56.089
that happened
at the restaurant

39:56.089 --> 39:57.177
to being a trick?

39:57.177 --> 39:58.918
She's not a trick.
- She a ho trick.

39:58.918 --> 40:00.180
What you mean?
- No, we're not gonna do that.

40:00.180 --> 40:02.661
No, she's not.
- Nah, I'm not doin' that.

40:05.359 --> 40:06.578
Drew looks like
a barking poodle

40:06.578 --> 40:08.362
trying to be Kandi
and Kenya's lapdog.

40:08.362 --> 40:09.711
Here, get it.

40:09.711 --> 40:12.192
Arf-arf.
She's barking.

40:12.192 --> 40:13.541
Somebody needs to be
throwing a bone at her.

40:13.541 --> 40:15.325
Arf-arf.

40:15.325 --> 40:17.458
I don't know where every--
where did Courtney go?

40:17.458 --> 40:18.633
Where did everybody go?

40:18.633 --> 40:19.808
Kandi gone, but I told
the rest of them,

40:19.808 --> 40:21.506
Monyetta and Kenya,
come in.

40:21.506 --> 40:23.203
So, Monyetta don't
wanna come in either?

40:23.203 --> 40:27.163
Since Queen Kandi is upset,
no one is coming, huh?

40:27.163 --> 40:29.427
Kenya and Monyetta
are acting like

40:29.427 --> 40:31.037
they just crossed
the burning sands

40:31.037 --> 40:32.604
of the Kandi Coated Clique.

40:32.604 --> 40:34.301
I wonder how much
the initiation fee is worth,

40:34.301 --> 40:36.085
because we know Kandi
like to charge, honey.

40:36.085 --> 40:38.479
I hope the bitches
at least got a jacket.

40:38.479 --> 40:39.785
Do they have
anger issues?

40:39.785 --> 40:41.047
Do they feel,
if they're around me,

40:41.047 --> 40:42.178
they're gonna fight me,
or they're gonna--

40:42.178 --> 40:43.484
I'm gonna bite them?

40:43.484 --> 40:44.529
But Drew keeps saying
you were aggressive.

40:44.529 --> 40:45.573
I'm like,
"She's not aggressive."

40:45.573 --> 40:46.705
- What?!
- I'm ready.

40:46.705 --> 40:48.141
What you wanna do?

40:48.141 --> 40:49.708
I can take you down
with one hit.

40:49.708 --> 40:51.231
It's an easy one, too.

40:54.582 --> 40:55.757
Flat hand.

40:55.757 --> 40:57.280
- I know it's not too good.
- A strike.

40:57.280 --> 40:59.413
Like, we have to be careful,
especially as Black women,

40:59.413 --> 41:00.893
not perpetuating
certain things.

41:00.893 --> 41:02.329
Drew is talking about not
saying certain words,

41:02.329 --> 41:03.678
but don't
call her aggressive

41:03.678 --> 41:05.898
when she literally has
her hands behind her back.

41:05.898 --> 41:07.508
Like, that's not cool.
- You know what?

41:07.508 --> 41:09.597
It really----s with me,
and it hurts.

41:09.597 --> 41:11.773
Leave my----ing
past alone.

41:11.773 --> 41:13.688
That's why
I'm not vulnerable.

41:13.688 --> 41:15.864
That's why I don't
open up to these girls.

41:15.864 --> 41:18.824
When all of a sudden
I came aggressive? When?

41:18.824 --> 41:20.565
No matter
how tall I am,

41:20.565 --> 41:22.567
no matter how high
my heels are,

41:22.567 --> 41:25.308
I am----ing human,
and I have feelings.

41:25.308 --> 41:27.136
Now, I wish that Marlo didn't
invite Drew over there.

41:27.136 --> 41:28.529
- Yeah.
- I think it might have been

41:28.529 --> 41:29.661
a better conversation
with just the two of them.

41:29.661 --> 41:31.227
- Just the two of 'em.
- Who got shots?

41:31.227 --> 41:33.839
Uh, yes, shots, shots.

41:33.839 --> 41:35.144
Is this
really strong?

41:35.144 --> 41:37.016
Because I've never
had a shot before.

41:37.016 --> 41:38.800
I think this might
be the night.

41:38.800 --> 41:39.758
- Thank you.
- Ready?

41:39.758 --> 41:41.281
Cheers. Thank you.

41:41.281 --> 41:43.631
We were supposed to
beat the bomb tonight,

41:43.631 --> 41:45.154
not beat the bitches.

41:45.154 --> 41:46.547
You're not ready.
You know I'm from the hood.

41:46.547 --> 41:47.809
I still wanna
play the game.

41:47.809 --> 41:49.332
Can we still play
with four people?

41:49.332 --> 41:50.377
Four is a perfect size.

41:50.377 --> 41:51.509
- Well, look at that.
- Great.

41:51.509 --> 41:52.858
Yeah, we wanna play.

41:52.858 --> 41:54.903
Tonight was supposed to be
about teambuilding,

41:54.903 --> 41:57.819
so I'm gonna build with
the team that I have left.

41:57.819 --> 41:59.342
So, you ladies
ready to go?

41:59.342 --> 42:01.257
You gonna guide us?
Tell us everything.

42:01.257 --> 42:02.520
So, the first room,

42:02.520 --> 42:04.217
you have to definitely communicate.

42:04.217 --> 42:07.002
- Okay.
- Go, Marlo. Go, Marlo. Go.

42:07.002 --> 42:10.353
The second room is probably
our most fun room.

42:10.353 --> 42:11.441
It's the laser room.

42:11.441 --> 42:12.747
Go back. Go back.
Marlo, Marlo.

42:12.747 --> 42:14.357
- Them titties-them titties--
- Go. Ooh, damn.

42:14.357 --> 42:16.272
But the better you do,
the more time you earn

42:16.272 --> 42:17.578
on the bomb clock.

42:17.578 --> 42:18.753
Wait, turn me
a little bit. Turn.

42:18.753 --> 42:20.755
Marlo, go.
Hell no, we did not win.

42:20.755 --> 42:21.800
We didn't even come close.

42:21.800 --> 42:23.889
Oh, sh--!

42:23.889 --> 42:26.892
Next time, on "The Real
Housewives of Atlanta"...

42:26.892 --> 42:29.198
I'm twerking in here now.

42:29.198 --> 42:31.505
Gotta learn how to twerk.

42:31.505 --> 42:32.767
What-what
is happening?

42:32.767 --> 42:35.074
- Oh, girl, I have a date.
- What?

42:35.074 --> 42:36.858
Okay, it just starts to feel
like our group is divided.

42:36.858 --> 42:38.033
I'm trying to put
something together.

42:38.033 --> 42:39.295
- Oh, okay.
- Let's make sure

42:39.295 --> 42:41.210
we're Gucci, and that's
what I'll call it.

42:41.210 --> 42:43.256
- Make sure we're Gucci.
- We-we need to all be Gucci.

42:44.910 --> 42:46.215
How do I know if
your butt is real or not?

42:46.215 --> 42:47.956
How I'm 'posed to know?
- What you gonna say?

42:47.956 --> 42:49.871
- Whoa.
- Bottom rung bitch.

42:49.871 --> 42:52.439
This is crazy!
No one will let me talk!

42:52.439 --> 42:53.788
her

42:53.788 --> 42:54.659
and those flowers--
- But that's what she said!

42:54.659 --> 42:55.616
She was expecting to get.

42:55.616 --> 42:56.835
Bye, love, bye.

42:56.835 --> 42:58.488
She's a----ing bitch!
