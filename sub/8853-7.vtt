01:38.230 --> 01:39.790
Y'all wanna know why?
Yeah.

Uh, because you had sex
with your wife.

01:42.360 --> 01:43.970
Laid out the tarp,

01:44.030 --> 01:46.030
got out that good-ass baby oil,
and I was in it,

01:46.100 --> 01:48.570
just bah, bah,
got in my power stance,

01:48.640 --> 01:50.570
and I was like
kah-kah-kah-kah-kah!

01:50.640 --> 01:53.440
'Cause there's only
one rule in my bedroom.

01:53.510 --> 01:56.180
All rules.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.050
It's like the wild,
wild west up in there,

I can feel that
Right now.

02:06.990 --> 02:09.190
Sweet.

02:09.259 --> 02:14.130
Oh, see, that's the kind
of love I'm looking for.

02:14.200 --> 02:15.830
Okay, so we're all
in agreement

02:15.900 --> 02:17.900
that Jillian can't come
with us to this thing tomorrow.

02:17.970 --> 02:19.700
What--w-why?
Why not?

02:19.770 --> 02:21.800
Because when you put Jillian
in a room with free wine,

02:21.870 --> 02:23.570
things tend to get punched
in the face hard.

02:23.640 --> 02:25.170
Yeah, but she wants
to find a man.

02:25.240 --> 02:26.710
I'm not about to stand
in the way of love.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.280
I'm not Billy Zane, man.

02:28.340 --> 02:30.210
Blake, I get it.
She's your friend.

02:30.280 --> 02:34.020
Hey, she's your friend too,
roboheart. God!

02:34.080 --> 02:35.680
Look, all I'm saying
is last time

02:35.750 --> 02:38.390
I got 25 business cards
and 12 Linkedin contacts.

02:38.450 --> 02:40.320
I plan on doubling that.

02:40.390 --> 02:43.560
But I can't have Jillian
stepping on my game.

02:43.630 --> 02:45.230
Wow, Ders.

02:45.290 --> 02:47.330

02:47.400 --> 02:50.400

02:50.470 --> 02:52.700

from last year?

02:52.770 --> 02:54.140
I was all
just droppin' in on it,

02:54.200 --> 02:56.470
just, hey, hey.
No, you weren't.

02:56.540 --> 02:58.340
No, you didn't.
You didn't have sex with her.

02:58.410 --> 02:59.910
No, I didn't have sex
with her.

02:59.980 --> 03:01.140
She had to go home
because her dog was sick.

03:01.210 --> 03:03.810
We were all worried.

03:03.880 --> 03:05.880
Remember that one-legged
wheelchair dude from last year?

03:05.950 --> 03:07.780
- Oh!
- He's gonna be there.

03:07.850 --> 03:10.620
Oh, yeah, that dude
totally punk'd you.

03:10.690 --> 03:13.050
Remember what he did, dude?

03:13.120 --> 03:15.160
Remember what he did?

03:15.220 --> 03:17.690
Oh! He cut off a chunk
of your hair, dude.

03:17.760 --> 03:19.160
That was a big
chunk of your hair.

03:19.230 --> 03:21.060
- Yeah, it was huge.
- I know.

03:21.130 --> 03:23.030
Remember how he just
held it out there

03:23.100 --> 03:24.570
while you stood there
just crying?

03:24.630 --> 03:26.430
- Ha ha! Adam!
- You were crying...

03:26.500 --> 03:28.440
Yes, I think we all remember
I was crying.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.940
Yes, I was there.
You were crying, dude.

03:31.010 --> 03:33.010
Ooh, inside voices.
Come on.

03:33.080 --> 03:35.740
You guys are right.
Jillian can't be there,

03:35.810 --> 03:37.280
because when
I just get these hands

03:37.350 --> 03:40.520
around his sweet little
wheelchair body,

03:40.580 --> 03:41.720
I'm gonna...

03:41.780 --> 03:43.120
Bust him!

03:43.190 --> 03:44.720
- Ooph.
- I'm sorry.

03:44.790 --> 03:47.390
I just don't want her
seeing that side of me.

03:47.460 --> 03:49.560
All right.
Here's the plan.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.090
We'll get Jillian a man

03:51.160 --> 03:54.060
to take her out
the same time as the mixer.

03:54.130 --> 03:56.830
Step one--
create an Internet profile.

03:56.900 --> 04:00.770
All right, okay.
Interests. What's Jillian into?

04:03.540 --> 04:05.410
- Mm...
- She's...

04:05.470 --> 04:07.240
Mm...

04:07.310 --> 04:09.410
Um...

04:09.480 --> 04:12.050
She's a girl, so...
Gerard Butler.

04:12.110 --> 04:13.210
- Yeah.
- Yep.

04:13.280 --> 04:15.120
Yeah, they do.
They love him.

04:15.180 --> 04:16.850
Good, good...And let's put
something to attract guys,

04:16.920 --> 04:17.990
like...

04:18.050 --> 04:20.790
Like "face down, ass up.

04:20.860 --> 04:24.860
That's the way we like to--"
Uh, camping works.

04:24.930 --> 04:26.660
That's the way
we like to camp.

04:26.730 --> 04:29.460
Now we just need a picture
of her from the Internet.

04:29.530 --> 04:31.830
Oh, there we go.
That one works.

04:31.900 --> 04:34.940
Is, uh--ahem--is there
another photo we could use?

04:35.000 --> 04:38.310
Why? This says I'm young,
I'm fun,

04:38.370 --> 04:40.410
and I've got a sense of humor,
that's for sure.

04:40.480 --> 04:44.010
It also says I like to do
weird stuff in the bedroom,

04:44.080 --> 04:45.780
which...In this Internet era...

04:45.850 --> 04:48.020
Dudes like that.
Yeah.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.320
But it's not illegal
for me to call you,

04:50.390 --> 04:52.720
so I can't get arrested.

04:52.790 --> 04:53.990
You know what, I'm gonna
call you back tomorrow.

04:54.060 --> 04:55.890
- Oh, we got one!
- See you. Thank you.

04:57.730 --> 04:59.790
- Okay.
- Found it.

04:59.860 --> 05:03.830
Yeah. Seems fine, like
a fairly non-murdery fellow.

05:03.900 --> 05:05.400
Normal looking dude,
if you ask me.

05:05.470 --> 05:06.430
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:06.500 --> 05:08.300
I give him my blessing.

05:08.370 --> 05:09.670
Nice.

05:11.410 --> 05:13.610
Knock, knock.
Knock.

05:13.680 --> 05:14.940
Ooh, come in!

05:16.350 --> 05:18.380

How would you like a date

05:18.450 --> 05:22.180

05:30.560 --> 05:32.730
Ooh! Jake?
Do I know him?

05:32.800 --> 05:34.630
No, I don't think
you know him.

05:34.700 --> 05:36.560
I don't think you've met him.
He's a friend of ours.

05:36.630 --> 05:38.270
Yeah, he's a real
beef castle.

Underneath the shirt,

08:35.210 --> 08:37.620
- Yeah.
- Get him!

08:37.679 --> 08:40.490
Hey.

08:40.549 --> 08:42.890
Hey, you.

08:42.960 --> 08:45.720
Look who it is.

08:45.790 --> 08:48.790
- You are--
- Ha ha ha! Check it out, guys.

08:48.860 --> 08:51.660
Paula Poundstone here
is wearing shoulder pads!

08:53.000 --> 08:54.600
Ha ha ha ha ha!

08:54.670 --> 08:56.430
You again.
What do you want?

08:56.500 --> 08:57.940
Hmm?

08:58.000 --> 08:59.470
- Ow.
- Ha ha ha!

08:59.540 --> 09:01.970
Whoo! Ooh!

09:03.510 --> 09:05.880
- Still as rude as ever.
- This is stupid.

09:05.950 --> 09:08.810
I gotta get in there.
She said I'm a five.

09:08.880 --> 09:10.680
Which is pretty good.

09:10.750 --> 09:11.920
Out of what?

09:11.980 --> 09:13.420
Five, I think.
I'm not sure.

09:13.490 --> 09:14.990
Hey, Jillian.

09:15.050 --> 09:17.120
What? No, I can't hear--

09:17.190 --> 09:19.320
okay. Okay.

09:19.390 --> 09:21.330
Okay, yeah, we'll come get you.

09:21.390 --> 09:22.890
I'm sorry.
We gotta go.

09:22.960 --> 09:24.860
Jillian's date's
like a total psycho.

09:24.930 --> 09:26.330
No. We're not going
anywhere.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.070
I haven't even gotten
a card yet.

09:28.130 --> 09:29.670
Ders...She was crying.

09:29.740 --> 09:31.670
The sexy kind, though?

09:31.740 --> 09:34.270
No. Like real tears.
Like native American tears.

09:34.340 --> 09:37.080
Blake, I'm not
gonna leave right now,

09:37.140 --> 09:40.210
'cause this girl
♪ was hot for my flavor ♪

09:40.280 --> 09:41.750
Plus, it's not our fault

09:41.810 --> 09:44.120
that Jillian got stuck
at the stupid party...

09:44.180 --> 09:46.020
Except that I just realized
that it is our fault.

09:46.090 --> 09:47.990
- 100%.
- God damn it.

09:48.050 --> 09:51.060
She's at a concert.
How bad can a concert be?

10:01.430 --> 10:03.070
Who the
Are these people?

10:03.140 --> 10:05.370
Uh...They're juggalos.

10:05.440 --> 10:07.870
You know, fans of
the insane clown posse.

10:07.940 --> 10:10.610
Gentlemen, welcome to
the dark carnival of souls.

10:10.680 --> 10:13.210
All right, guys, I know there's
a lot of really fun stuff here,

10:13.280 --> 10:15.680
but let's try not to
get sidetracked.

10:15.750 --> 10:17.580
Sidetracked? This entire place
should be firebombed.

10:17.650 --> 10:19.350
They all look like Satan.

10:19.420 --> 10:20.690
Aah! Oh!

10:20.750 --> 10:22.090
Hey, there you...Are.

10:22.150 --> 10:23.860
All right, let's split up

10:23.920 --> 10:26.360
and meet back here
in half an hour, let's say?

10:26.430 --> 10:29.960
Whoa! They've got
a hatchet-throwing contest.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.700
Let's make it three hours, huh?

10:31.760 --> 10:33.600
Okay, Blake,
I know the smell of weird

10:33.670 --> 10:35.130
gets your balls all tingly,

10:35.200 --> 10:37.740
but put on the blinders
and just find Jillian.

10:37.800 --> 10:39.840
You're right.
I'm on the case.

11:37.160 --> 11:38.830
Some poop fell out of
your pants.

11:38.900 --> 11:40.670
That fell out.
Hey, sheep.

11:40.730 --> 11:42.500
You stray too far
from the herd,

11:42.570 --> 11:44.370
and the wolves will get you.

11:44.440 --> 11:46.640
Okeydokey.
That's good advice.

11:46.710 --> 11:48.070
Cool costume.
Hey.

11:48.140 --> 11:49.310
You're the one
wearing the costume--

11:49.380 --> 11:51.010
society's costume.

11:51.080 --> 11:52.340
Oh, man.

11:52.410 --> 11:54.310
Society's costume.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.080
This is fun.
I'm gonna get goin', though.

11:56.150 --> 11:57.820
Why? What are you
so afraid of, sheep boy?

11:57.880 --> 11:59.920
I'm not afraid of anything,
except for maybe carbs,

11:59.990 --> 12:02.290
'cause I'm in
a cutting phase right now.

12:02.360 --> 12:04.920
Those are nunchucks.
Whoa! That one got close.

12:04.990 --> 12:06.290
All righty.
Poor little sheepy

12:06.360 --> 12:08.530
walking around
in your sheep clothing

12:08.590 --> 12:10.200
just thinking
your sheep thoughts.

12:10.260 --> 12:11.860
- Uh-huh.
- Do you wanna continue

12:11.930 --> 12:15.770
to just be a faceless drone
in a [Bleep] Society...

12:15.840 --> 12:17.670
Or do you wanna
play with my boobs?

12:19.840 --> 12:21.940
Hey, guys, maybe
you could help me out.

12:22.010 --> 12:24.210
I-I'm kinda lost.
I'm lookin' for somebody.

12:24.280 --> 12:26.380
If you have a map
with a legend or anything...

12:26.450 --> 12:27.910
Okay, thank you.

12:27.980 --> 12:30.720
Jeez, it's hot.
It's like Hades.

12:30.780 --> 12:32.720
Hey, um, I see you got
some cold beverages here.

12:32.790 --> 12:34.850
You mind if I buy one
off of you guys?

12:34.920 --> 12:36.960
Honestly, I could go for
a vitamin water

12:37.020 --> 12:38.490
or a juice.

12:38.560 --> 12:40.290
Hell, at this point
I'd take a dasani.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.230
Okay, if you can hear me,

12:42.290 --> 12:45.400
I'm gonna put $5 right here
on your gross, inflatable cooler

12:45.460 --> 12:48.930
and, uh...A faygo.
What is a faygo?

12:49.000 --> 12:50.500
You've got redpop, moon mist.

12:50.570 --> 12:51.900
Do you have anything
that's not faygo,

12:51.970 --> 12:53.770
besides red rock--
Whoa! Whoa!

12:53.840 --> 12:55.770
You all right there, camper?
You look lost.

12:55.840 --> 12:58.240
Oh, do I? Thank you,
detective Zoobilee zoo.

12:58.310 --> 12:59.940
Unless you have some schweppes

13:00.010 --> 13:02.780
or something like
a nantucket nectar, get lost.

13:02.850 --> 13:04.680
Okay. Easy, man.
I'm just trying to help.

13:04.750 --> 13:08.050
If you like Fresca--
Oh, my God, is this Fresca?

13:10.120 --> 13:11.620
Oh, Fres.

13:11.690 --> 13:14.490
Well, actually,
that's faygo moon mist.

13:14.560 --> 13:16.230
Really?

13:16.300 --> 13:18.400
Booyah, bitch!

13:18.460 --> 13:20.730
Awesome, dude.
Can I give it a try?

13:20.800 --> 13:22.470
Go for it, ninja.
Crack that dome.

13:22.540 --> 13:24.100
Yeah.
Okay, you're askin' for it.

13:24.170 --> 13:25.940
I'm gonna just split you open.

13:26.010 --> 13:27.910
- Sweet spot.
- This one's for dad.

13:27.970 --> 13:29.370
Bah!

13:29.440 --> 13:31.340
Whoa.

13:31.410 --> 13:33.480
Is that Jillian?

13:40.890 --> 13:43.020
Sometimes I look at myself
in the mirror,

13:43.090 --> 13:44.820
and I'm like...

13:44.890 --> 13:46.490
Who are you, Adam?

13:46.560 --> 13:47.990
I bet you lift weights

13:48.060 --> 13:49.360
to try to look like
those juice heads

13:49.430 --> 13:50.860
in the magazines.

13:50.930 --> 13:53.330
Guilty as charged!

13:53.400 --> 13:55.400
I'm just a lat guy, you know?

13:55.470 --> 13:58.240
I've got these amazing lats,
and...

13:58.300 --> 14:00.570
I'm just living in
an ab guy's world.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.310
It doesn't matter.

14:02.370 --> 14:04.880
Because now you are...

14:06.710 --> 14:08.480
Sugar bear.

14:08.550 --> 14:10.580
Sugar bear.
That is...

14:10.650 --> 14:12.820
Nice...I like that.

14:12.880 --> 14:17.250
But what if we chose
a different name like...

14:17.320 --> 14:19.690
Dangerous...

14:19.760 --> 14:21.390
You know, wolf...
Or something.

14:21.460 --> 14:23.590
Something
that has an edge to it.

14:23.660 --> 14:24.860
No?
No.

14:24.930 --> 14:26.200
All right.
Yeah, sugar bear.

14:26.260 --> 14:27.560
That's a good one.
I like that too.

14:27.630 --> 14:29.900
You want another?

14:29.970 --> 14:32.270
Please,
it's the least I can do.

14:32.340 --> 14:35.440
Ro, can you grab
another faygo for Anders?

14:35.510 --> 14:37.040
- Oh, sure, hon.
- Thanks.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.010
It's just so hot out here.
It's so good.

14:39.080 --> 14:41.180
It's a good beverage.

14:41.250 --> 14:42.650
Thanks, sweetie.

14:42.710 --> 14:44.410
Let me know if you want me
to take Becca.

14:44.480 --> 14:45.620
- Okay.
- Hi, pumpkin.

14:45.680 --> 14:47.780
Daddy loves you.
Bye!

14:49.620 --> 14:51.560
- Oh, you got a great family.
- Oh, thanks.

14:51.620 --> 14:54.390
I gotta ask, what--
what brings a guy like you

14:54.460 --> 14:56.230
to a place like this?

14:56.290 --> 14:58.430
Ah! Direct.
I like that.

14:58.500 --> 15:00.460
Uh, I tell you,
it started two years ago

15:00.530 --> 15:03.000
when I came to my first
juggalo concert

15:03.070 --> 15:05.500
to sell hatchets.
Wait. You're in sales?

15:05.570 --> 15:07.970
I'm in sales too!
Telamericorp.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.670
- T.A.C.?
- Yeah.

15:09.740 --> 15:12.110
Get out! I did business
with them a few years ago.

15:12.180 --> 15:14.040
Hey, ro, Anders here
works for Telamericorp!

15:14.110 --> 15:16.150
Oh, my God.
Really?

15:16.210 --> 15:18.220
That is a piss.
You know what?

15:18.280 --> 15:19.550
I like the cut of your jib.

15:19.620 --> 15:21.320
Let me give you
my business card.

15:21.390 --> 15:23.190
Maybe we can toss each other
a little business.

15:23.250 --> 15:25.020
Yeah, that'd be great.
Thank you.

15:25.090 --> 15:27.860
Do you, uh...
Do you want my card?

15:27.930 --> 15:29.560
- Sure. I'd love it.
- All right.

15:29.630 --> 15:31.660
We'll just exchange cards.
Yeah.

15:31.730 --> 15:33.930
So...The makeup, that's...

15:34.000 --> 15:36.170
That's part of
the sales thing, right?

15:36.230 --> 15:37.570
No, it's gonna sound crazy,

15:37.640 --> 15:39.240
but we actually have fun here.

15:39.300 --> 15:41.070
Get this--
last weekend in Fresno,

15:41.140 --> 15:43.910
they even got me on stage
to do a rapping battle.

15:45.780 --> 15:49.580
- You rapped?
- Well, I'm no odb, but...

15:49.650 --> 15:51.350
They don't judge you here.

15:51.420 --> 15:55.920
You wanna give it a shot,
just let me know.

15:55.990 --> 15:58.520
♪ But those who know me know
I'm dealing the realness ♪

15:58.590 --> 16:01.260

16:18.740 --> 16:21.880
Uh...I'm here to save ya.
You called us.

16:21.950 --> 16:24.280
Oh, did I not call you back?
Everything's fine.

16:24.350 --> 16:26.720
You should stay at the mixer.

16:26.780 --> 16:29.420
Wow, you are super-drunk,
aren't you, Jillian?

16:29.490 --> 16:31.220
Whoop whoop
whoop-whoop-whoop.

16:31.290 --> 16:33.060
That's the juggalo's call.
All right, come on.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.360
I'm gonna get ya outta here.

16:34.430 --> 16:35.660
Let's go get some
wine and cheese.

16:35.730 --> 16:37.130
Whoa! Who's this
fake-ass jugga-ho?

16:37.200 --> 16:39.000
Dr. Neden, you know Blake.

16:39.060 --> 16:41.360
Hey, Blake, Neden

16:41.430 --> 16:44.330
So I'm definitely getting
that dong near this thong.

16:44.400 --> 16:46.840
Oh, wow. Okay, great.
Um, no, but actually,

16:46.900 --> 16:49.510
I don't know who this guy is.
I'll explain that to you later.

16:49.570 --> 16:51.440
She's not goin' anywhere
with you.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.110
And if you touch her,

16:53.180 --> 16:55.110
I'll knock your
dick-tickler off your face, son.

16:55.180 --> 16:58.110
- Wha--
- He means your moustache.

16:58.180 --> 16:59.420
Oh, you're saying
I tickle--

16:59.480 --> 17:01.650
no. Uh-uh.

17:01.720 --> 17:04.190
Everywhere I turn, it's bullies.
Big, fat bullies.

17:04.260 --> 17:06.560
Whatever, Paula Poundstone.

17:06.619 --> 17:08.260
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Paula Poundstone.

17:08.329 --> 17:10.690
No! You're goin' down!

17:10.760 --> 17:12.099
Blake!

17:12.160 --> 17:15.500
Aah!
Oh...!

17:25.560 --> 17:28.230
- Aah! Monsters!
- Hey, hey, hey!

17:28.300 --> 17:30.470
It's us. You're safe now.
Ders, Adam?

17:30.530 --> 17:33.040
Why's Jillian hanging out
with that bully still?

17:33.100 --> 17:35.700
She's fine.
We're all fine.

17:35.770 --> 17:38.170
Especially her.

17:38.240 --> 17:39.880
Let me see them titties, girl.

17:39.940 --> 17:41.480
Blake, it turns out...

17:41.550 --> 17:43.150
We found everything
we were looking for

17:43.210 --> 17:45.150
right here
at the dark carnival of souls.

17:45.220 --> 17:47.320
That's great, and forgive me
for not celebrating,

17:47.380 --> 17:49.350
but I've just had
a really horrible day,

17:49.420 --> 17:51.920
and I'd like to go home,
drink a box of wine,

17:51.990 --> 17:53.520
maybe take a warm bath,

17:53.590 --> 17:56.590
and gently masturbate
myself to sleep, okay?

17:56.660 --> 17:58.330
Aah! My back!
Hey! No, come on.

17:58.400 --> 18:00.030
Up you go, up you go.
In the chair.

18:00.100 --> 18:02.900
Well, you're not going home
to masturbate just yet.

18:02.970 --> 18:04.530
I didn't say
I was gonna masturbate.

18:04.600 --> 18:05.840
We're gonna go back
to the mixer, buddy.

18:05.900 --> 18:08.340
Show those juggahos how we do.

18:08.410 --> 18:10.070
Like what's the tightest
thing in the world?

18:10.140 --> 18:12.170
- Butt holes.
- Yes. Ideally, a butt hole.

18:12.240 --> 18:13.680
Yeah. A butt hole.

18:13.740 --> 18:15.710
But I was talking about
the bonds of a family.

18:15.780 --> 18:18.910
A psychopathic family.

18:18.980 --> 18:22.520
So what do you say?

18:22.590 --> 18:24.090
♪ Homies, homies ♪

18:24.150 --> 18:26.190
♪ talkin' about
road dogs of mine ♪

18:26.260 --> 18:27.690

18:27.760 --> 18:29.430

18:29.490 --> 18:31.360

18:31.430 --> 18:33.030

18:33.100 --> 18:34.500

18:34.560 --> 18:35.930

18:36.000 --> 18:38.630
Oh, hello.
Look what we have here.

18:38.700 --> 18:41.170
Whoa! What the hell?

18:41.240 --> 18:44.540
Mm. Jealousy
does not look good on you.

18:44.610 --> 18:46.310
Who are you?

18:46.380 --> 18:48.080
Does this maneuv
ring any bells?

18:48.150 --> 18:49.910
Ohh.
Stairwell?

18:49.980 --> 18:53.250
Oh, wait, there's no bra here,
and I like that much better.

18:53.320 --> 18:55.680
This is so weird.

18:55.750 --> 18:58.150
My tits are telling me
to sleep with you.

18:58.220 --> 18:59.990
Mmm. I like what
your tits have to say.

19:05.700 --> 19:08.100
- Done deals.
- Guess what, chumps?

19:08.170 --> 19:09.730
I don't even need
your card anymore,

19:09.800 --> 19:12.470
because I've got
the king of cards.

19:12.540 --> 19:14.170
Hey, Jeff, look who's back.

19:14.240 --> 19:16.070
Davis king...

19:16.140 --> 19:19.940
Number one hatchet salesman
in the southwest region.

19:20.010 --> 19:21.710
Bah!

19:21.780 --> 19:23.510
Score for the Ders!

19:23.580 --> 19:25.350
Jeff, what's a Der?

19:25.420 --> 19:28.580
- You, dude.
- Nice makeup.

19:28.650 --> 19:30.920
The Der.
I get called the Ders.

19:32.820 --> 19:36.560
Hey.

19:36.630 --> 19:38.990
What's this?
Making fun of me?

19:39.060 --> 19:41.730
Quite the contrary.

19:41.800 --> 19:43.830
I'm here for something
totally different.

19:43.900 --> 19:46.970
- Good.
- And that's to say I'm sorry.

19:47.040 --> 19:49.610
Yeah, that's right.

19:49.670 --> 19:51.540
You see, I've learned
a lot about family today.

19:51.610 --> 19:55.380
And much like butt holes,
families are meant to be tight.

19:55.450 --> 19:58.550
- 'Scuse me?
- Look, man...

20:00.450 --> 20:02.450
We're all family, okay?
And I...

20:02.520 --> 20:04.450
I know what it's like
to be trapped in a chair.

20:04.520 --> 20:07.490
I've been in this seat prison
for like 25 minutes now.

20:07.560 --> 20:09.330
It's rough.
But you know what?

20:09.390 --> 20:12.390
Even though you have been
a jerk to me...

20:12.460 --> 20:14.560
I still love ya.

20:14.630 --> 20:16.830
Thanks, man.

20:16.900 --> 20:20.700
Got a lotta...
Anger I need to work through.

20:20.770 --> 20:22.970
Tend to push people away.

20:23.040 --> 20:26.280
Hey, less pushing,
more hugging--what do you say?

20:26.340 --> 20:28.380
Get in here.
All right.

20:31.510 --> 20:33.150
- No, no, no, no!
- You mess with my family,

20:33.220 --> 20:36.790
you mess with me!
No, Jake Heisenripbower!

20:36.850 --> 20:40.160
That's right, ninja.
Time to suck this nunchuck!

20:42.330 --> 20:44.190
So let's not hang out
with juggalos anymore.

20:44.260 --> 20:46.160
They are who we thought
they were.

20:46.230 --> 20:48.600
Walking, talking
diarrhea people.

20:48.670 --> 20:51.330
Big money Hustla's
coming to Thanksgiving.

20:51.400 --> 20:53.700
Those are her boobs.
Oh, my God!
