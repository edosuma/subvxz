01:06.838 --> 01:09.178
HAPPY FIRST
ANNIVERSARY, APRIL.

01:09.179 --> 01:12.659
HOPE YOU HAVE
ANOTHER TUBULOSO YEAR
AT CHANNEL 6.

01:12.660 --> 01:14.800
OH, THANKS GUYS.

01:14.801 --> 01:16.975
BUT I'M JUST NOT
IN THE MOOD
FOR A PARTY.

01:16.976 --> 01:18.380
WHAT'S WRONG, APRIL?

01:18.381 --> 01:20.154
I'M WORRIED
ABOUT MY JOB.

01:20.155 --> 01:23.399
BURNE THOMPSON SAID
I BETTER COME UP
WITH A BIG STORY OR...

01:23.400 --> 01:24.670
OR WHAT?

01:24.671 --> 01:25.874
OR I WON'T BE AROUND

01:25.875 --> 01:27.849
TO CELEBRATE
MY SECOND YEAR.

01:27.850 --> 01:29.924
HEY, I KNOW WHAT'LL
CHEER YOU UP.

01:29.925 --> 01:31.095
IRMA, I NEED YOU.

01:32.701 --> 01:35.511
EASY, IRMA. IT'S ONLY
TO HELP ME PICK UP A PIZZA.

01:37.720 --> 01:39.225
ENOUGH, KRANG!

01:39.226 --> 01:41.199
IT'S GOING
TO EXPLODE!

01:41.200 --> 01:42.237
SILENCE!

01:42.238 --> 01:44.913
I'M THE SCIENTIFIC
GENIUS HERE!

01:48.695 --> 01:50.735
NOW, ARE
YOU SATISFIED?

01:50.736 --> 01:53.244
I TOLD YOU
THE PLASMA
HEAT DISSIPATOR

01:53.245 --> 01:55.151
WOULDN'T STAND
THAT MUCH OVERLOAD.

01:55.152 --> 01:56.155
BUT NO MATTER.

01:56.156 --> 01:58.765
IF THESE READINGS
ARE CORRECT,

01:58.766 --> 02:01.208
WE WILL SOON
HAVE NO MORE NEED

02:01.209 --> 02:03.248
OF YOUR SHODDY WORK.

02:03.249 --> 02:05.758
WHAT ARE YOU
RAVING ABOUT?

02:05.759 --> 02:09.371
I HAVE DETECTED
A NEW FORM OF ENERGY

02:09.372 --> 02:13.521
GENERATED BY THE NUCLEAR
FISSION REACTOR
AT THE UNIVERSITY.

02:13.522 --> 02:18.438
ENERGY POWERFUL ENOUGH
TO RAISE THE TECHNODROME,

02:18.439 --> 02:21.751
<i>AND I WANT YOU
TO LOCATE IT.</i>

02:22.990 --> 02:27.306
THIS GLUE FACTORY
SURE MAKES A NEAT
HIDEOUT, BOSS.

02:27.307 --> 02:31.589
FAIL ME, AND
I'LL BE MAKING GLUE
OUT OF BOTH OF YOU.

02:31.590 --> 02:35.168
THIS WILL LOCATE
THE ENERGY SOURCE. NOW, GO!

02:35.169 --> 02:36.272
RIGHT AWAY, BOSS.

02:36.273 --> 02:38.146
UMM, WHERE
WE GOING TO?

02:38.147 --> 02:42.195
TO THE FISSION PLANT!
THE FISSION PLANT!

02:42.196 --> 02:47.347
YOU KNOW, THIS FISHIN'S
THE EASIEST JOB
WE EVER HAD.

02:47.348 --> 02:48.385
YEAH.

02:49.556 --> 02:50.225
YEAH, BOSS?

02:50.226 --> 02:51.563
WELL?

02:51.564 --> 02:55.612
NO, BOSS. WE'VE
BEEN FISHING H

02:55.613 --> 02:57.552
AND WE AIN'T HAD A NIBBLE.

02:57.553 --> 03:01.166
FISHING? I SENT YOU
OUT FOR FISSION.

03:01.167 --> 03:02.604
NOT FISHING!

03:04.379 --> 03:07.222
WAIT TILL I GET
MY HANDS ON YOU--YOU--

03:07.223 --> 03:08.996
HUH? WHAT THE--

03:10.267 --> 03:14.449
HEY! COME BACK WITH
MY FISHING PARTNER!

03:14.450 --> 03:16.289
AND ANOTHER THING.

03:16.290 --> 03:17.862
DON'T WALK AWAY WHILE
I'M TALKING TO YOU!

03:17.863 --> 03:19.434
I'LL BE GOOD, BOSS.

03:19.435 --> 03:23.349
PLEASE DON'T ZAP ME
LIKE YOU DID
ROCK STEADY.

03:23.350 --> 03:25.524
WHAT ARE YOU
BABBLING ABOUT?

03:25.525 --> 03:27.732
YOU MEAN YOU DIDN'T--

03:27.733 --> 03:30.576
YOU MEAN,
HE JUST, JUST...

03:36.600 --> 03:39.275
I GIVE YOU TWO IMBECILES
A SIMPLE ASSIGNMENT,

03:39.276 --> 03:40.982
AND YOU CAN'T EVEN
CARRY IT OUT.

03:40.983 --> 03:44.394
BUT, BOSS, SOMETHING
AWFUL HAPPENED.

03:44.395 --> 03:47.406
WHAT? YOU LOST
ROCK STEADY?

03:47.407 --> 03:49.681
WELL, YEAH.
THAT ALSO.

03:49.682 --> 03:52.526
THAT ALSO?
WHAT ELSE WENT WRONG?

03:52.527 --> 03:55.771
WE DIDN'T CATCH
A SINGLE FISH.

03:58.114 --> 04:00.086
ARE YOU SURE
THIS WILL CHEER
APRIL UP?

04:00.087 --> 04:01.458
ARE YOU KIDDING?

04:01.459 --> 04:04.504
APRIL'S A SUCKER
FOR PEPPITO'S
PAN-AMERICAN PIZZAS.

04:06.713 --> 04:08.485
[GASPS]
WHAT'S THAT LIGHT?

04:13.404 --> 04:17.017
AND THEN ZIP!
HE WAS GONE!

04:17.017 --> 04:18.923
IF HIS STORY
IS TRUE,

04:18.925 --> 04:21.166
THERE'S ONLY
ONE EXPLANATION

04:21.166 --> 04:23.307
FOR THIS STRANGE
OCCURRENCE.

04:23.308 --> 04:24.311
WHAT?

04:24.312 --> 04:26.051
VISITORS FROM SPACE!

04:26.052 --> 04:32.107
VISITORS WHO COULD
MAKE OUR WILDEST
DREAMS COME TRUE!

04:32.108 --> 04:33.813
ONE MINUTE
HE WAS
AT MY SIDE--

04:33.814 --> 04:35.954
AND THE NEXT MINUTE,
HE WAS GONE.

04:35.955 --> 04:38.331
DONATELLO VANISHED
INTO THIN AIR?

04:38.332 --> 04:40.672
IRMA'S STORY
EXPLAINS MUCH.

04:40.673 --> 04:43.316
I'VE SENSED
AN ALIEN PRESENCE...

04:44.354 --> 04:47.230
UNLIKE ANYTHING
EARTH HAS
SEEN BEFORE.

04:47.231 --> 04:50.509
WOW! VISITORS
FROM ANOTHER PLANET!

04:50.510 --> 04:51.914
THIS COULD BE
JUST THE STORY

04:51.915 --> 04:54.190
TO GUARANTEE MY JOB
AT CHANNEL 6!

04:54.191 --> 04:55.896
DONATELLO?
WITH ALIENS?

04:55.897 --> 04:58.138
THIS SOUNDS SERIOUS!

04:59.143 --> 05:01.584
WHOA! THE ROLLER
COASTER COMPANIES

05:01.585 --> 05:04.261
WOULD LOVE
TO HAVE THAT RIDE!

05:04.262 --> 05:06.235
I'D BETTER
CALL THE TURTLES.

05:06.236 --> 05:07.841
THE TURTLECOM!

05:07.842 --> 05:09.982
I MUST HAVE
DROPPED IT!

05:11.456 --> 05:13.328
SOMETHING'S
HEADED THIS WAY!

05:14.969 --> 05:17.143
IT'S, IT'S...

05:17.144 --> 05:18.983
ROCK STEADY?

05:18.984 --> 05:21.861
HEY, WHAT'S
GOING ON HERE?

05:21.862 --> 05:23.868
BEATS THE HECK
OUT OF ME.

05:23.869 --> 05:27.649
WELL, SOUNDS LIKE
A GOOD IDEA,
PIZZA BREATH!

05:29.022 --> 05:32.032
OH, YEAH?
AND YOU'RE A FLAPJACK!

05:32.033 --> 05:35.546
YOU WANT TO PLAY SOME MORE?
OR SHALL WE TRY TO FIND
A WAY OUT OF HERE?

05:35.547 --> 05:40.062
UM...WHAT WAS THAT
FIRST QUESTION AGAIN?

05:40.063 --> 05:42.404
SO, WHERE DO YOU
THINK WE ARE?

05:42.405 --> 05:43.542
I'M NOT CERTAIN.

05:43.543 --> 05:45.817
WE MAY BE
IN SOME PARALLEL
DIMENSION.

05:51.707 --> 05:54.650
I'M OUT OF HERE!

05:54.651 --> 05:56.457
THIS WAY!

05:56.458 --> 05:59.434
IT SOUNDS LIKE HE'S
RIGHT BEHIND US.

05:59.435 --> 06:02.480
YOU NEED TO GET
YOUR HEARING CHECKED.

06:06.864 --> 06:09.840
WHY DO I KEEP
SAVING HIM?

06:12.484 --> 06:14.491
ROCK STEADY,
I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

06:14.492 --> 06:17.804
MAKE THIS THING
CHARGE US.

06:19.712 --> 06:22.655
YOUR MOTHER WEARS
HIGH-HEEL SHOES

06:24.597 --> 06:25.599
BACK!

06:27.240 --> 06:30.217
WE SURE FOOLED HIM!

06:30.218 --> 06:32.225
HEY, IT DISAPPEARED.

06:36.910 --> 06:39.485
AND, OF COURSE,
I'D LIKE
A NEW CHAIR.

06:39.486 --> 06:42.496
VERNON! WHAT ARE YOU
DOING TO MY DESK?

06:42.497 --> 06:43.700
YOUR DESK?

06:43.701 --> 06:45.909
TELL HER, BURNE.

06:45.910 --> 06:50.091
APRIL, THERE'LL BE CHANGES
AROUND HERE AND REAL SOON.

06:50.092 --> 06:54.106
CHANGES? BUT I'VE GOT
THE BIGGEST STORY
OF THE CENTURY.

06:54.107 --> 06:56.047
NOT BIGGER
THAT VERNON'S STORY,

06:56.048 --> 06:57.988
AND I'M SENDING
HIM OUT TO COVER IT.

06:57.989 --> 07:00.363
I FOUND OUT
THERE'S SOME
STRANGE RADIATION

07:00.364 --> 07:02.739
COMING FROM
THE NEW REACTOR
AT THE UNIVERSITY.

07:02.740 --> 07:05.884
BUT MY STORY IS
MUCH BIGGER, MR. THOMPSON!

07:05.885 --> 07:07.523
IF YOU'D JUST
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT--

07:07.524 --> 07:09.900
APRIL,
IF YOU WANT TO TAG ALONG

07:09.901 --> 07:12.375
ON VERNON'S RADIATION STORY,
YOU CAN...

07:12.376 --> 07:14.851
AS HIS CAMERA OPERATOR.

07:14.852 --> 07:17.427
CAMERA OPERATOR?

07:17.428 --> 07:18.431
ME?

07:18.432 --> 07:21.777
OH, MY LIFE
IS OVER!

07:23.584 --> 07:26.862
LIKE, WHAT WOULD'VE MADE
THESE WEIRD BURN MARKS?

07:26.863 --> 07:28.736
ONLY ONE THING.

07:28.737 --> 07:30.476
SOME POOR KLUTZ
MUST HAVE DROPPED

07:30.477 --> 07:32.350
ONE OF PEPPITO'S
HOT CHILI PIZZAS.

07:32.351 --> 07:34.291
HOLD ON.
WHAT'S THAT?

07:34.292 --> 07:35.830
IT'S DONATELLO'S
TURTLECOM.

07:35.831 --> 07:38.306
THEN IRMA
WAS RIGHT!

07:38.307 --> 07:42.020
OUR AMIGO'S BEEN
GRABBED BY ALIENS
FROM OUTER SPACE!

07:42.021 --> 07:44.830
I JUST HOPE HE'S ALL RIGHT.

07:44.831 --> 07:47.340
WHAT ARE
WE DOING NOW?

07:47.341 --> 07:49.849
TRYING TO FIND A WAY
OUT OF HERE,

07:49.850 --> 07:52.860
AS SOON AS I FIGURE OUT
WHERE "HERE" IS.

07:54.233 --> 07:56.206
I GUESS WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO GO THAT WAY.

07:59.286 --> 08:02.196
WE CAN'T GO
THAT WAY NEITHER!

08:02.197 --> 08:05.641
HEY! WHAT'S
GOING ON HERE?

08:05.642 --> 08:08.084
I'VE GOT A THEORY
ABOUT THIS.

08:08.085 --> 08:09.656
JUST LET GO
OF THE WALL.

08:09.657 --> 08:12.768
ARE YOU OUT
OF YOUR SHELL?

08:12.769 --> 08:14.642
JUST DO IT! IT'S
OUR ONLY CHANCE!

08:14.643 --> 08:17.018
I BETTER BE RIGHT
ABOUT THIS.

08:21.402 --> 08:23.174
I WAS RIGHT.

08:24.280 --> 08:27.658
HA HA HA!
WAY TO GO, EARTHLINGS.

08:27.659 --> 08:30.836
NIKTO, STOP PLAYING
WITH THE EARTHLINGS.

08:30.837 --> 08:32.710
OH, BUT IT'S FUN!

08:32.711 --> 08:35.153
THEY'RE SO
WEIRD-LOOKING!

08:35.154 --> 08:38.164
I AM KLATTU.
WHO ARE YOU?

08:38.164 --> 08:41.041
I'LL SHOW YOU
WHO I AM.

08:43.585 --> 08:45.257
HEY! WHAT THE--

08:46.864 --> 08:49.539
MY, MY,
SUCH A TEMPER.

08:49.540 --> 08:51.146
PLEASE FORGIVE US.

08:51.147 --> 08:54.659
WE DIDN'T KNOW
THAT LITTLE NIKTO
BEAMED YOU HERE.

08:54.660 --> 08:58.139
I JUST WANTED
SOMEBODY
TO PLAY WITH.

08:58.140 --> 08:59.979
NIKTO WOULD NOT
HAVE HURT YOU.

08:59.980 --> 09:04.630
THE CREATURE AND
THE DISAPPEARING FLOOR
WERE MERELY ILLUSIONS.

09:04.631 --> 09:05.634
I FIGURED
THAT OUT,

09:05.635 --> 09:08.510
BUT WHERE ARE WE
AND WHO ARE YOU?

09:08.511 --> 09:11.824
I'M KLATTU.
THIS IS THE LITTLE
WOMAN BERRATA.

09:11.825 --> 09:14.801
WE' COME FROM THE
STAR SYSTEM ANTARES.

09:16.341 --> 09:17.511
YOU ARE
IN OUR SPACE SHIP

09:17.512 --> 09:19.418
SEVERAL MILES
ABOVE YOUR PLANET.

09:19.420 --> 09:20.891
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

09:20.892 --> 09:23.066
WE VACATIONED
ON YOUR PLANET

09:23.067 --> 09:24.571
SOME 4,000 YEARS AGO.

09:24.572 --> 09:28.185
LITTLE NIKTO LEFT ONE
OF HIS TOYS BEHIND.

09:28.186 --> 09:30.225
YOU CAME ALL THE WAY
BACK FOR A TOY?

09:30.226 --> 09:33.069
THE SITUATION IS
QUITE SERIOUS.

09:33.070 --> 09:35.612
YOU EARTHLINGS
CONSTRUCTED

09:35.613 --> 09:37.787
A NUCLEAR REACTOR PLANT
RIGHT ON TOP OF IT.

09:37.788 --> 09:39.929
THE RADIATION IS
CAUSING THE TOY

09:39.930 --> 09:41.267
TO APPROACH
MELTDOWN.

09:41.268 --> 09:43.308
WHEN THAT TOY
DISINTEGRATES,

09:43.309 --> 09:47.122
IT WILL DESTROY
ALL LIFE ON YOUR PLANET.

09:47.123 --> 09:49.967
WE'RE TALKING END

09:49.968 --> 09:51.572
THE END OF THE WORLD?

09:51.573 --> 09:54.751
HEY! LET ME OUT
OF THESE THINGS!

09:54.752 --> 09:55.989
I'LL BE GOOD!

09:55.990 --> 09:59.134
ALL RIGHT,
BUT IF YOU MISBEHAVE,

09:59.135 --> 10:00.573
BACK YOU GO.

10:02.715 --> 10:07.197
OH, BOY. THAT'S
SOME NEATO TRICK!

10:07.198 --> 10:10.142
MY TURTLE FRIENDS AND I
CAN HELP YOU RECOVER
NIKTO'S TOY.

10:10.143 --> 10:12.718
WE WOULD
BE MOST GRATEFUL.

10:13.756 --> 10:15.061
I'M GETTING
A READING, KRANG.

10:15.062 --> 10:16.165
CAN YOU ANALYZE IT?

10:16.166 --> 10:18.306
YES. IT'S
ALMOST IDENTICAL

10:18.307 --> 10:20.581
TO THAT OF THEIR
FISSION REACTOR.

10:20.582 --> 10:22.254
THEN IT'S TRUE.

10:22.255 --> 10:24.663
WE DO HAVE VISITORS
FROM OUTER SPACE!

10:24.664 --> 10:26.403
WE MUST FIND
THEIR SPACE SHIP!

10:26.404 --> 10:28.411
FORGET
THE SPACE SHIP!

10:28.412 --> 10:30.251
GET TO
THE FISSION PLANT

10:30.252 --> 10:32.393
AND FIND
THAT ENERGY SOURCE.

10:32.394 --> 10:35.905
BUT THINK OF WHAT TREASURES
THE ALIEN SHIP MIGHT HOLD.

10:35.906 --> 10:38.113
DO AS YOU'RE TOLD!

10:38.114 --> 10:41.125
I WANT THAT
ENERGY SOURCE NOW!

10:41.126 --> 10:46.244
SO THE
ENTIRE WORLD
WILL BE AT MY FEET!

10:46.245 --> 10:48.151
WHAT FEET?

10:48.152 --> 10:52.334
YOU REALLY KNOW HOW
TO HURT A PERSON,
DON'T YOU?

10:52.335 --> 10:55.077
I'M GOING TO PREPARE
OUR PARTICLE TRANSMITTER

10:55.078 --> 10:57.119
TO BEAM MYSELF
ABOARD THAT SPACE SHIP,

10:57.120 --> 10:59.460
AND TAKE IT OVER!

10:59.461 --> 11:02.304
WOW! THIS SHIP
IS INCREDIBLE!

11:02.305 --> 11:04.312
IT'S NOTHING FANCY,

11:04.313 --> 11:05.818
BUT IT'S PAID FOR.

11:05.819 --> 11:08.394
THIS IS OUR ENERGY
CONVERSION UNIT.

11:08.395 --> 11:10.066
IT TRANSMUTES
MATTER TO ENERGY,

11:10.067 --> 11:12.710
YOU MEAN YOU POWER
THIS ENTIRE
SPACESHIP

11:12.711 --> 11:13.713
WITH JUST
THIS THING?

11:13.714 --> 11:15.621
NOT ONLY THAT,

11:15.622 --> 11:18.431
IT MAKES
GREAT COFFEE.
HAVE SOME.

11:18.432 --> 11:20.205
NO THANKS.
I GAVE IT UP.

11:20.206 --> 11:25.290
BOSS, YOU SHOULD
SEE ALL THE NEAT
STUFF THEY GOT UP HERE.

11:25.291 --> 11:27.030
NEAT STUFF?

11:27.031 --> 11:29.038
WHAT IS YOUR LOCATION?

11:29.039 --> 11:31.548
I'M IN A BIG ROOM...

11:31.549 --> 11:33.153
SOMEWHERE.

11:33.154 --> 11:35.395
I MEANT
THE COORDINATES

11:35.396 --> 11:38.407
OF THE ALIEN SHIP,
YOU DIMWIT!

11:38.408 --> 11:40.146
OH! OK, BOSS.

11:40.147 --> 11:43.693
NOW HOW'D
THAT BUG TURN
THIS THING ON?

11:43.694 --> 11:45.198
OOH, YEAH!

11:52.594 --> 11:56.039
CAN YOU SEE IT, BOSS?

11:56.040 --> 11:57.043
BOSS?

11:58.416 --> 12:02.364
YOU GOING
TO BEAM UP FROM
THE GLUE FACTORY?

12:02.365 --> 12:03.668
OH, NO, YOU DON'T!

12:06.513 --> 12:09.088
WE WARNED YOU
ABOUT THIS BEHAVIOR.

12:09.089 --> 12:11.765
WE ANTARIANS
DETEST VIOLENCE.

12:11.766 --> 12:15.145
MOSTLY BECAUSE
WE DON'T LIKE
TO CLEAN UP AFTERWARDS.

12:15.146 --> 12:17.185
WE'RE

12:17.186 --> 12:20.197
THIS GOON JUST BROADCAST
OUR COORDINATES TO SHREDDER.

12:20.198 --> 12:22.505
SHREDDER?
ANOTHER MUTANT?

12:22.506 --> 12:24.279
A HAMSTER PERHAPS?

12:24.280 --> 12:27.792
GEE, DAD, CAN I
KEEP HIM FOR A PET?

12:27.793 --> 12:30.502
BELIEVE ME, KID,
YOU WOULDN'T WANT
THIS GUY FOR A PET.

12:30.503 --> 12:32.242
NOW, WHAT CAN WE DO?

12:32.243 --> 12:35.053
ROCK STEADY'S COMLINK.

12:35.054 --> 12:36.056
IF I CAN REWIRE THIS,

12:36.057 --> 12:37.896
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO
CONTACT THE TURTLES.

12:37.897 --> 12:40.875
MAYBE THEY CAN
INTERCEPT SHREDDER.

12:40.876 --> 12:44.019
DONATELLO,
WHERE ARE YOU?

12:44.020 --> 12:46.027
I'M ON BOARD
AN ALIEN SPACE SHIP.

12:46.028 --> 12:48.169
AN ALIEN SPACE SHIP?

12:48.170 --> 12:50.711
I'M ALL RIGHT, BUT YOU'VE
GOT TO STOP SHREDDER.

12:50.712 --> 12:53.388
HE'S HIDING OUT
AT SOME GLUE FACTORY.

12:53.389 --> 12:54.458
WHICH ONE?

12:54.459 --> 12:55.462
I DON'T KNOW.

12:55.463 --> 12:57.504
BUT IF HE GETS HIS HANDS

12:57.505 --> 12:58.775
ON THIS
HIGH-TECH EQUIPMENT,

12:58.776 --> 13:00.280
HE'LL BE UNSTOPPABLE.

13:00.281 --> 13:01.451
TURTLES...

13:01.452 --> 13:04.128
WE HAVE MUCH WORK TO DO.

13:04.129 --> 13:05.701
THE ACME GLUEWORKS.

13:05.702 --> 13:08.745
IT LOOKS LIKE
SHREDDER'S STYLE.

13:08.747 --> 13:10.620
THIS IS IT.

13:10.621 --> 13:12.995
I SENSE
MY OLD ENEMY'S PRESENCE.

13:12.996 --> 13:16.508
THERE!
THE PARTICLE TRANSMITTER
IS SET TO BEAM ME

13:16.509 --> 13:17.444
TO THAT ALIEN SHIP.

13:17.445 --> 13:19.218
THE COUNTDOWN
IS AUTOMATIC.

13:19.219 --> 13:22.363
SOON, THE ALIEN'S POWER
WILL BE MINE!

13:22.364 --> 13:24.605
COWABUNGA!

13:24.606 --> 13:26.914
THE TURTLES...
GET THEM!

13:26.915 --> 13:28.553
TURTLE TARGETS!

13:32.101 --> 13:35.279
I'M GROWING TIRED
OF YOUR MEDDLING,
RODENT.

13:35.280 --> 13:39.026
IF YOU'RE TIRED,
I SUGGEST
YOU LIE DOWN.

13:41.302 --> 13:42.806
WE GOTTA SHUT DOWN
THE COUNTDOWN!

13:42.807 --> 13:45.717
I'M GOING
TO SHUT YOU DOWN!

13:54.685 --> 13:57.529
HEY, DUDE,
WHAT GOES QUACK-QUACK?

13:57.530 --> 13:58.934
DUCK?

13:58.935 --> 14:00.841
EXACTEMONDO!

14:03.619 --> 14:05.124
MASTER SPLINTER!

14:07.233 --> 14:09.072
THEY'RE GONE!

14:16.032 --> 14:17.169
WHAT HAPPENED?

14:17.170 --> 14:20.248
IT APPEARS WE'RE
ON THE ALIEN
SPACE SHIP.

14:20.249 --> 14:23.793
EXCELLENT! LET ME SEE
WHAT I CAN FIND.

14:23.794 --> 14:26.604
WE'LL CONTINUE
THIS LATER, ANCIENT ONE.

14:26.605 --> 14:28.879
I HAD BETTER
FIND DONATELLO.

14:30.955 --> 14:34.668
THIS IS THE MOST
DELICIOUS PIZZA,
DONATELLO.

14:34.669 --> 14:35.805
PIZZA?

14:35.806 --> 14:39.653
IT'S EVEN BETTER
THAN VENUTIAN TREE SLUGS.

14:39.654 --> 14:40.959
WHO WANTS MORE?

14:47.083 --> 14:48.353
DONATELLO?

14:48.354 --> 14:50.862
MASTER SPLINTER!
HOW'D YOU GET HERE?

14:50.863 --> 14:53.204
I WAS BEAMED UP
VIA PARTICLE
TRANSMITTER,

14:53.205 --> 14:54.810
JUST AS YOU WERE.

14:54.811 --> 14:57.520
SHREDDER HAS BEEN
BEAMED ABOARD,
AS WELL.

14:57.521 --> 14:59.863
I BETTER
FIND THE BOSS.

14:59.864 --> 15:01.870
BOSS! YOO-HOO!

15:01.871 --> 15:03.342
OH, BOSS!

15:04.615 --> 15:07.926
QUICKLY, SHOW ME
WHERE THE ALIENS
KEEP THEIR WEAPONS.

15:07.927 --> 15:11.540
DOWN THAT WAY
OR MAYBE IT WAS THAT WAY.

15:11.541 --> 15:15.053
THEN AGAIN, I THINK
IT WAS THAT WAY.

15:16.358 --> 15:18.566
THEN THEY BOTH
DISAPPEARED.

15:18.567 --> 15:22.414
THAT TREACHEROUS
PIECE OF SLIME.

15:22.415 --> 15:26.228
SHREDDER WANTS
THE ALIEN TECHNOLOGY
FOR HIMSELF.

15:26.229 --> 15:28.369
PAY ATTENTION
NOW, BEBOP.

15:28.370 --> 15:30.678
THIS IS
THE FISSION PLANT.

15:30.679 --> 15:32.184
YOU'RE TO GO THERE,

15:32.185 --> 15:34.526
FIND THE ALIEN
SOURCE OF POWER,

15:34.527 --> 15:35.998
AND BRING IT TO ME,

15:35.999 --> 15:40.181
AND REMEMBER,
THIS IS YOUR
LAST CHANCE.

15:40.182 --> 15:42.322
GEE, THANKS.

15:42.323 --> 15:44.362
SCIENTISTS ARE
NOW IDENTIFYING

15:44.363 --> 15:48.478
THE STRANGE RADIATION
AS UNLIKE ANYTHING BEFORE SEEN,

15:48.479 --> 15:51.824
BUT THEY ASSURE US
NO DANGER EXISTS.

15:51.825 --> 15:54.702
AND NOW VERNON'S DOING
MY NEWSCAST!

15:54.703 --> 15:57.411
IT SURE LOOKS LIKE
HE'S TAKING OVER
YOUR JOB.

15:57.412 --> 15:59.754
THIS IS
THE LAST STRAW!

15:59.755 --> 16:00.858
I'M TELLING OFF

16:00.859 --> 16:03.969
BURNE THOMPSON
RIGHT NOW!

16:03.970 --> 16:05.375
PLEASE MR. THOMPSON.

16:05.376 --> 16:09.022
ONE MORE CHANCE
IS ALL I ASK.

16:09.023 --> 16:11.866
YOUR INVASION FROM
MARS FAIRY TALE?

16:11.867 --> 16:14.677
GREAT REAL, APRIL.
THIS IS A NEWS SHOW,

16:14.678 --> 16:16.350
NOT THE MOVIE
OF THE WEEK.

16:16.351 --> 16:18.056
FAIRY TALE, HUH?

16:18.057 --> 16:20.130
JUST YOU WAIT AND SEE!

16:21.437 --> 16:24.347
YOU ACTUALLY SPOKE
TO DONATELLO
ONBOARD THE SPACE SHIP?

16:24.348 --> 16:25.785
WE SURE DID.

16:25.786 --> 16:27.826
LET'S GET IT IN GEAR, DUDES.

16:27.827 --> 16:30.135
WE GOT TO SAVE
THE WORLD!

16:32.076 --> 16:35.554
OK, FOLKS. HERE'S
THE WON TON AND LOX
PIZZA I PROMISED. I--

16:35.555 --> 16:36.960
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THEM?

16:36.961 --> 16:39.737
APPARENTLY, MOZZARELLA
HAS A SOPORIFIC EFFECT

16:39.738 --> 16:41.444
ON ANTERIAN PHYSIOLOGY.

16:43.452 --> 16:47.165
I HAVE WON!
THE ALIEN'S POWER
IS IN MY HANDS!

16:47.166 --> 16:49.206
IN MINE, TOO!

16:50.278 --> 16:53.790
I JUST CAN'T
TAKE YOU ANYWHERE.

16:53.791 --> 16:55.764
YOU HAVEN'T
WON YET, SHREDDER.

16:57.137 --> 16:58.775
WHAT IS THIS?

16:58.776 --> 17:01.552
GET USED
TO THOSE CHAINS,
SPLINTER.

17:01.553 --> 17:03.895
YOU'LL BE WEARING THEM
FOR A LONG TIME,

17:03.896 --> 17:06.873
BUT FIRST
I HAVE A WORLD
TO CONQUER.

17:06.874 --> 17:11.656
AND A POMPOUS,
SELF-I
TO MAKE BEG FOR MERCY.

17:11.657 --> 17:15.436
NOW, LET'S GET
TO THE FISSION PLANT
BEFORE KRANG DOES.

17:15.438 --> 17:18.348
BERRATA, NIKTO!
WAKE UP!

17:18.348 --> 17:21.594
OH, GREAT!
THEY SNOOZE
AND WE LOSE!

17:21.595 --> 17:23.869
LET US HOPE THE TURTLES
CAN STOP SHREDDER.

17:23.871 --> 17:25.843
LET'S ALSO HOPE
THEY CAN STAND UP

17:25.844 --> 17:27.550
AGAINST THE ALIEN
TECHNOLOGY.

17:27.550 --> 17:30.060
SOMEHOW
THEY WILL HAVE TO.

17:30.061 --> 17:32.803
HEY, HURRY UP,
YOU GUYS!

17:36.317 --> 17:37.855
BRING IT UP.

17:37.856 --> 17:38.859
HEY, DUDES!

17:38.860 --> 17:40.265
TAKE FIVE!

17:40.266 --> 17:41.737
GET THEM!

17:43.711 --> 17:46.086
MAYBE I CAN
PICK UP A STRIKE.

17:50.671 --> 17:52.209
SET THEM UP
IN THE NEXT ALLEY!

17:53.213 --> 17:55.488
GOING UP!

17:55.489 --> 17:57.262
NOW I GOT YOU!

17:59.571 --> 18:01.243
HEY, DON'T
SWEAT IT, DUDES.

18:01.244 --> 18:02.749
I GOT YOUR PURSUIT
COVERED.

18:02.750 --> 18:04.388
YO, BEBOP!

18:10.612 --> 18:13.790
WHAT A SENSATIONAL
STORY THIS'LL MAKE!

18:14.795 --> 18:16.567
WHAT WAS THAT?

18:16.568 --> 18:18.073
IT'S SHREDDER!

18:18.074 --> 18:21.720
CORRECTION.
THE NEW IMPROVED SHREDDER.

18:21.721 --> 18:23.660
NOW I AM INVINCIBLE.

18:23.661 --> 18:26.639
YEAH, WE'LL SEE HOW
INVINCIBLE YOU ARE,
METAL MOUTH.

18:28.345 --> 18:31.590
HE'S GOT SOME KIND OF
FORCE FIELD
PROTECTING HIM.

18:31.591 --> 18:33.865
AND THAT'S NOT ALL.

18:36.007 --> 18:40.223
SO FAR THIS STORY
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT HAS
A VERY HAPPY ENDING.

18:40.224 --> 18:44.572
I'M SO GLAD
YOU'RE HERE,
MISS O'NEILL.

18:44.573 --> 18:46.312
YOU SHALL HAVE
AN EXCLUSIVE STORY

18:46.313 --> 18:49.022
ON MY CONQUEST
OF THE WORLD.

18:49.023 --> 18:52.536
NOT IN THIS
LIFETIME, SHREDDER!

18:52.537 --> 18:54.108
AND NOW
TO RETRIEVE

18:54.109 --> 18:56.283
THE ANTARIAN
POWER SOURCE!

18:58.225 --> 19:00.532
TOTALLY AWESOME!

19:02.708 --> 19:04.681
DIDN'T I SEE THIS
IN A MOVIE ONCE?

19:06.355 --> 19:09.065
THAT'S A KID'S TOY?

19:09.066 --> 19:11.038
AND SHAME ON YOU
FOR STEALING IT.

19:11.039 --> 19:14.083
SPLINTER, DONATELLO,
HOW DID YOU GET FREE?

19:14.084 --> 19:16.224
FORTUNATELY,
OUR ANTARIAN FRIENDS

19:16.225 --> 19:18.332
HAVE GREAT POWERS
OF RECUPERATION.

19:18.333 --> 19:20.340
YOU'D BETTER HOPE
YOU DO, TOO.

19:20.341 --> 19:23.786
HEY! WHO SNITCHED
MY BLASTER?

19:23.787 --> 19:25.024
THE ALIENS DID.

19:25.025 --> 19:27.299
A MERE PARLOR TRICK.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.206
I HAVE
FAR GREATER POWERS.

19:31.850 --> 19:33.857
YOU BETTER BE
WAVING BYE-BYE.

19:33.858 --> 19:37.270
THE ANTARIANS
JUST TOOK AWAY
ALL YOUR GOODIES.

19:38.543 --> 19:41.318
THANKS A LUMP,
DONATELLO.

19:41.319 --> 19:45.300
RAD HAPPENING.
WE'RE FREE, DUDES!

19:45.301 --> 19:46.437
HEAD FOR COVER!

19:46.438 --> 19:49.516
HEY, NO FAIR
RUNNING AWAY.

19:51.491 --> 19:52.996
WHAT'S GOING ON?

19:52.997 --> 19:55.003
THOSE LASER BLASTS
HAVE ACCELERATED

19:55.004 --> 19:55.974
THE MELTDOWN
PROCESS.

19:55.975 --> 19:57.981
KRANG, SEND THE MODULE.

19:57.982 --> 20:01.929
THIS MUST BE
THAT END OF THE WORLD
KLATTU WAS TALKING ABOUT.

20:01.930 --> 20:03.334
DO YOU KNOW HOW
TO STOP IT?

20:03.335 --> 20:05.643
UH, NO, BUT I'M OPEN
TO SUGGESTIONS.

20:07.953 --> 20:11.398
THE MODULE!
SAVE THE WORLD
BY YOURSELVES!

20:11.399 --> 20:13.306
FOOLISH TURTLES!

20:14.678 --> 20:16.852
WE CAN'T STOP
THIS THING!

20:16.853 --> 20:20.365
I'VE GOT AN IDEA.
KEEP THAT CAMERA RUNNING!

20:21.671 --> 20:23.879
WHAT SHE DOING?

20:25.953 --> 20:27.091
IT STOPPED!

20:27.092 --> 20:29.700
THERE!
SO MUCH FOR THAT.

20:29.701 --> 20:31.540
HOW'D YOU
DO THAT, APRIL?

20:31.541 --> 20:34.886
SIMPLE.
EVERY KID'S TOY
HAS BATTERIES.

20:35.925 --> 20:39.001
YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE
GOING TO HAVE IT ALL.

20:39.002 --> 20:41.912
INSTEAD,
YOU HAVE ZIP!

20:41.913 --> 20:43.619
LOOK WHO'S TALKING.

20:43.620 --> 20:44.623
YOU DON'T
EVEN HAVE HANDS

20:44.624 --> 20:46.128
TO FIX
YOUR EQUIPMENT.

20:46.129 --> 20:48.973
LET ME HELP,
BOSS.

20:52.754 --> 20:56.501
KEEP THAT UP AND
YOU WON'T HAVE HANDS, EITHER!

20:59.112 --> 21:01.519
<i>AND WITH THE VISITING
ALIENS NOW HEADED HOME,</i>

21:01.520 --> 21:03.292
<i>OUR PLANET IS
ONCE AGAIN SAFE.</i>

21:03.293 --> 21:05.936
<i>THIS IS APRIL O'NEILL
OF CHANNEL 6 NEWS.</i>

21:05.937 --> 21:06.939
<i>SIGNING OFF.</i>

21:06.940 --> 21:08.479
GREAT SHOW, APRIL.

21:08.480 --> 21:09.784
THANKS, GUYS.

21:09.785 --> 21:13.164
AND BEST OF ALL,
I'VE GOT MY OFFICE
BACK FROM VERNON

21:13.165 --> 21:15.204
AND A THREE-YEAR CONTRACT!

21:15.205 --> 21:18.884
THE ROAD TO SUCCESS
IS OFTEN PAVED
WITH ADVERSITY.

21:18.885 --> 21:21.562
HEY, I JUST GOT OFF
THE INTERSTELLAR TRANSMITTER

21:21.563 --> 21:22.666
WITH KLATTU.

21:22.667 --> 21:25.510
HE SAID THEY'LL RETURN
IN THE YEAR 4989.

21:25.511 --> 21:28.856
WHOA! I BETTER START
COOKING SOME PIZZAS!

21:28.857 --> 21:32.937
MICHELANGELO,
THEY WON'T BE BACK
FOR ANOTHER 3,000 YEARS.

21:32.938 --> 21:35.715
WHY WAIT TILL
THE LAST MINUTE?
