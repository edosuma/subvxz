WEBVTT

00:06.909 --> 00:09.711
Whoo-woo!

00:11.814 --> 00:16.351
Hey, guys. What exactly
am I looking at here?

00:16.353 --> 00:19.221
Trish told me if I
give her a pedicure,

00:19.223 --> 00:21.256
I can meet her clients...
Boynado.

00:21.258 --> 00:25.193
They're coming to town Friday, and
I am not looking forward to it.

00:25.195 --> 00:28.430
But Boynado's the
best boy band ever!

00:31.201 --> 00:35.270
Ugh, it blows my mind that
people actually like that song.

00:35.272 --> 00:40.275
Blows your mind? Like a
strong gust of wind?

00:40.277 --> 00:42.844
Or a cyclone? Or...

00:47.250 --> 00:48.917
So what is all
this stuff anyway?

00:48.919 --> 00:52.254
I haven't seen you work
this hard since...

00:52.256 --> 00:54.656
Nope, I have never seen
you work this hard.

00:54.658 --> 00:58.293
I know. Figuring out Boynado's
travel arrangements

00:58.295 --> 01:00.695
is like trying to solve the
world's largest Jigsaw puzzle.

01:00.697 --> 01:03.765
I'm still trying to solve the
world's smallest Jigsaw puzzle.

01:06.235 --> 01:08.503
Dez, that's just a single piece.

01:08.505 --> 01:09.971
But where does it go?

01:09.973 --> 01:14.709
Look, Rupert won't sit
next to Devin on the plane

01:14.711 --> 01:16.745
'cause they both like
the window seat.

01:16.747 --> 01:18.379
Nigel won't share
his hairstylist

01:18.410 --> 01:21.550
'cause he thinks Rupert is trying
to copy his signature swoop.

01:21.552 --> 01:24.686
And Devin won't room
with Nigel or Rupert

01:24.688 --> 01:27.856
'cause he swears the combination of
their colognes gives him the hiccups.

01:27.858 --> 01:30.625
Well, technically,
that could happen.

01:30.627 --> 01:34.663
You see, scientifically, hiccups...
never mind.

01:34.665 --> 01:37.399
All Boynado does is fight.

01:37.401 --> 01:40.502
If it wasn't for me managing them, they
would have broken up a long time ago.

01:40.504 --> 01:42.437
Well, you better not
let them break up.

01:42.439 --> 01:44.473
That would be a disaster.

01:44.475 --> 01:46.675
You might say natural disaster.

01:46.677 --> 01:48.977
Like a hurricane. Or...

01:53.450 --> 01:56.384
Come on, guys, we'll let
you get back to work.

01:59.323 --> 02:02.757
What the heck is that alarm for?

02:04.000 --> 02:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:07.524 --> 03:11.359
Am I dreaming again or did we
just enter a parallel universe

03:11.361 --> 03:14.629
where the government is producing
botched Austin moon clones?

03:14.631 --> 03:17.399
No, you're not dreaming,
that's Benny Boyd.

03:17.401 --> 03:19.034
He's an Austin
moon impersonator.

03:19.036 --> 03:20.769
Come on, Austin.
Let's go say hi.

03:20.771 --> 03:22.904
I'm sure he's a really big fan.

03:22.906 --> 03:25.607
You! You ruined my life!

03:25.609 --> 03:29.811
Okay, so slightly less of
a fan than anticipated.

03:29.813 --> 03:32.447
Sorry. I'm just going
through a tough time.

03:32.449 --> 03:34.382
When you got banned from music,

03:34.384 --> 03:37.652
I was the number one Austin
moon tribute act in the world.

03:37.654 --> 03:40.021
But then you made a
comeback and boom!

03:40.023 --> 03:41.790
I can barely get a penny
in my guitar case.

03:41.792 --> 03:44.993
Aw, here's a nickel, buddy.

03:44.995 --> 03:47.562
Do you have any change?

03:47.564 --> 03:51.833
I'm really sorry. But for what
it's worth, you're super talented.

03:51.835 --> 03:54.469
Thanks. My fans sure thought so.

04:06.148 --> 04:10.418
Well, that's all over now. I'm
moving back in with my parents.

04:10.420 --> 04:12.487
It's time to put this
silly dream to rest.

04:12.489 --> 04:15.957
Tell you what. Why don't you
come stay at our music school?

04:15.959 --> 04:18.627
That way you'll have a free place to
live while you get back on your feet.

04:18.629 --> 04:20.495
And in the meantime, I
can be your mentor.

04:20.497 --> 04:24.532
Really? That'd be great.
Thank you.

04:24.534 --> 04:27.702
Austin, are you sure? There's
not really anywhere to sleep.

04:27.704 --> 04:29.437
That never stopped Trish.

04:31.073 --> 04:34.075
And, hey, it's always good
to help a person in need.

04:34.077 --> 04:36.978
Besides, I see a little bit
of myself in this kid.

04:36.980 --> 04:41.950
Really? Where? 'Cause he
looks more like me than you.

04:43.953 --> 04:47.789
Okay, I'm all packed. Let me just
grab my backup dancers and we can go.

04:50.993 --> 04:53.061
Let's go, girls. Pick
up the pace, Janine.

05:25.562 --> 05:27.595
I love you, Boynado!

05:49.151 --> 05:52.520
And then my tenth favorite video would
have to be whirlwind kind of love.

05:52.522 --> 05:54.923
Though I do love
rain cloud remix.

05:54.925 --> 05:57.559
But if I had to pick, I'd
put whirlwind at number 10,

05:57.561 --> 05:59.243
heart spin at 11,
vortex at 12...

05:59.274 --> 06:01.963
Dez, you have been through
this line five times.

06:01.965 --> 06:05.133
Get out of here.

06:05.135 --> 06:07.602
And, Rupert, you need to start
signing your name smaller.

06:07.604 --> 06:10.071
I don't know what you mean.

06:12.675 --> 06:15.543
Yeah, you're covering
up my dimples.

06:15.545 --> 06:18.580
And after me abs and me eyes,
they're my best feature.

06:18.582 --> 06:21.049
Well, it's certainly
not your brain.

06:21.051 --> 06:22.684
You spelled your
name wrong again.

06:22.686 --> 06:25.620
Oh. Whoopsies.

06:27.022 --> 06:30.625
What a twit. Hey, Devin,
pick up the pace!

06:30.627 --> 06:32.727
You don't need to write a
personalized poem on each photo.

06:32.729 --> 06:35.764
But I like to give my
fans a piece of my soul.

06:35.766 --> 06:39.000
Here you go, Jane. In my
heart, you'll forever remain.

06:40.087 --> 06:44.272
Besides, no one rushed Nigel when he
was an hour late for sound check.

06:44.274 --> 06:46.741
Sorry, but do you think
I just roll out of bed

06:46.743 --> 06:49.677
and naturally have this
"rolled out of bed" look?

06:49.679 --> 06:53.314
No, this takes hours. And really,
you should be mad at Rupert.

06:53.316 --> 06:55.049
He didn't even show up.

06:55.051 --> 06:57.786
I don't need a sound check to
tell me how perfect I sound.

06:57.788 --> 07:02.590
I can check myself.

07:02.592 --> 07:05.593
See? Still perfect.

07:05.595 --> 07:08.263
Guys, enough.

07:08.265 --> 07:10.765
People paid good money
to meet you today.

07:10.767 --> 07:13.735
So stop fighting, put on
your smiles and get it done.

07:13.737 --> 07:16.905
Excuse me. Coming through. Sorry.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

07:16.907 --> 07:20.708
Horgie Borgie, I'm a fan
from a faraway land.

07:20.710 --> 07:23.645
We've never met before. Would
you mind taking a selfie?

07:23.647 --> 07:26.648
Or as we call them in my
country, a "sploogen splagen."

07:26.650 --> 07:29.617
Dez, do you really think
anyone's gonna fall for that?

07:29.619 --> 07:33.688
- Say "sploogen splagen."
- "Sploogen splagen."

07:36.158 --> 07:38.393
That is the last time I go
to Dom's dollar spaghetti.

07:38.395 --> 07:40.795
There was a tooth
in my meatball.

07:40.797 --> 07:42.630
Just look on the bright side.

07:42.632 --> 07:45.393
You put that tooth under your pillow
tonight, you just paid for lunch.

07:46.635 --> 07:48.870
Die, alien beast.

07:48.872 --> 07:50.171
Benny.

07:50.173 --> 07:53.775
Oh, hey, guys, pardon
my appearance.

07:53.777 --> 07:55.143
I wasn't expecting company.

07:55.145 --> 07:58.279
Company? You're
living in our school.

07:58.281 --> 08:00.748
Yeah, thanks again for that.

08:03.353 --> 08:06.654
So I really appreciate it.

08:06.656 --> 08:08.823
I see you moved all
your stuff in.

08:08.825 --> 08:12.660
Not all of it. There are two
more truckloads coming.

08:12.662 --> 08:15.897
Uh, I know you're just
getting moved in,

08:15.899 --> 08:18.766
but have you put any
thought into your future?

08:22.439 --> 08:26.908
Not really. But I've got a
lot of potential leads.

08:26.910 --> 08:30.345
Well, that's awesome. Why don't
we sort through them together?

08:30.347 --> 08:34.148
Or I could help you work on some
fresh dance moves for your new act.

08:34.150 --> 08:36.683
Oh, can't. That's
my pizza bagels.

08:36.686 --> 08:39.721
I can help you
work on those too.

08:41.724 --> 08:44.392
Whoa, Trish, are you okay?

08:44.394 --> 08:48.863
Guess who just broke up a physical
fight between the Boynado boys.

08:48.865 --> 08:50.198
Well, what happened?

08:50.200 --> 08:53.368
I don't know. Rupert stole
Devin's poetry book.

08:53.370 --> 08:57.171
Nigel got a wedgie. There was
some drama about a biscuit.

08:58.774 --> 09:01.209
Oh, no, Dez, were you
in the fight, too?

09:01.211 --> 09:05.213
Huh? No, I was just rolling around
the grass looking for ladybugs.

09:05.215 --> 09:06.281
Got one.

09:06.283 --> 09:09.217
Dez, that's a cockroach.

09:09.219 --> 09:12.287
I wondered why it
didn't have any spots.

09:12.289 --> 09:15.256
I'm officially
done with Boynado.

09:15.258 --> 09:18.126
No more schedules, no more fights,
no more endless phone calls...

09:18.128 --> 09:20.194
I'm done.

09:20.196 --> 09:24.933
I see. The harsh realities of the
situation exceeded your expectations.

09:24.935 --> 09:27.902
Thus, triggering your
fight or flight response.

09:27.904 --> 09:31.472
As per usual, flight won.

09:31.474 --> 09:32.281
Huh?

09:32.312 --> 09:35.510
What I'm saying is I'm not
surprised you gave up.

09:35.512 --> 09:38.913
When the going gets tough,
Trish gets herself fired.

09:38.915 --> 09:40.415
Why didn't you just
say that then?

09:40.417 --> 09:43.318
I just wanted to
do the bird thing.

09:46.288 --> 09:49.290
So what's your
plan to get fired?

09:51.193 --> 09:52.860
I'm not gonna get myself fired.

09:52.862 --> 09:56.898
Oh. You're gonna quit.

09:56.900 --> 10:00.368
No. Dez is right.

10:00.370 --> 10:02.270
And I'm sick of being a quitter.

10:02.272 --> 10:04.906
I mean, it's one thing to quit
jobs I have no interest in,

10:04.908 --> 10:07.875
but managing is something I
love and take seriously.

10:10.046 --> 10:11.913
Looks like you can start now.

10:11.915 --> 10:15.049
You've got a missed
call from Boynado.

10:15.051 --> 10:17.552
Actually, it's 367 missed calls.

10:17.554 --> 10:22.390
And one really long text.

10:22.392 --> 10:26.027
Well, I did say it'd
be a challenge.

10:27.196 --> 10:29.530
It's all in British.

10:36.538 --> 10:37.602
Thanks for coming, guys.

10:37.633 --> 10:40.174
I called you in today
because we have a problem.

10:40.176 --> 10:42.043
And it's my job to fix it.

10:42.045 --> 10:44.846
We're gonna figure out a way
for you guys to get along.

10:45.915 --> 10:48.583
You guys just gotta
work together.

10:48.585 --> 10:51.085
Like in your song unite
to fight the storm.

10:51.087 --> 10:54.088
But you also gotta want it.
Like in your song want it.

10:54.090 --> 10:57.091
So, what do you say?

11:02.332 --> 11:06.968
Great. Let Boynado
boot camp begin.

11:06.970 --> 11:09.003
First thing's first,
let's take attendance.

11:09.005 --> 11:10.838
I'll need you all to go
ahead and sign in here

11:10.840 --> 11:12.974
on this commemorative
Boynado t-shirt.

11:15.477 --> 11:18.579
You have enough autographs.

11:18.581 --> 11:21.849
All right, let's start with some team
building exercises. Gather round.

11:21.851 --> 11:26.554
We're gonna start with
"the unity circle."

11:26.556 --> 11:28.589
Now a team is like a circle.

11:28.591 --> 11:31.492
Everyone is connected and equal.

11:31.494 --> 11:34.496
But right now, your
circle is a tangled mess.

11:34.527 --> 11:35.997
Like Nigel's hair.

11:35.999 --> 11:42.003
Oh, really? I have three top tween
awards for best hair that say otherwise.

11:42.005 --> 11:45.406
Please stop fighting. I'm this
close to a stress pimple.

11:45.408 --> 11:48.976
Guys, focus on the exercise.

11:48.978 --> 11:53.514
Now without letting go, you must work
together to untangle the string.

11:55.552 --> 11:59.921
This could take hours, but in the process,
they'll learn to communicate better,

11:59.923 --> 12:04.125
work as a team, and hey, maybe even
have a little fun along the way.

12:04.127 --> 12:05.193
Done.

12:06.261 --> 12:09.397
And you're right. That was fun.

12:16.205 --> 12:19.907
Whoa, this place is a mess.

12:19.909 --> 12:22.276
And where are all
of our students?

12:22.278 --> 12:24.045
They're supposed to be
down here practicing.

12:24.047 --> 12:25.913
Oh, I sent them home.

12:25.915 --> 12:27.062
What?

12:27.093 --> 12:31.682
I was taking a nap and all the banging
and clanging kept waking me up.

12:33.655 --> 12:37.091
So how are the career plans coming? Did
you follow up with any of those leads?

12:37.093 --> 12:40.962
You know, I'm about to. I'm just in the
middle of an intense bowling game.

12:40.964 --> 12:43.064
About to set a new
personal best.

12:43.066 --> 12:46.100
Oh.

12:46.102 --> 12:49.470
Austin, can I talk to you?

12:51.106 --> 12:53.241
Aw, man. A split.

12:53.243 --> 12:56.144
Don't you see what's
going on here?

12:56.146 --> 13:00.581
Yeah, he's gonna have to hook left on his
next turn if he wants to pick up the spare.

13:00.583 --> 13:04.185
No, Benny's taking
advantage of you.

13:04.187 --> 13:08.222
I know you want to help him, but
he's barely helping himself.

13:08.224 --> 13:11.726
Just give him time. He'll turn
himself around just like I did.

13:11.728 --> 13:16.197
Fine, but if he eats my
pickles, it is on you.

13:16.199 --> 13:17.965
I got it.

13:17.967 --> 13:20.735
Benny, it's time to kick
start your new career.

13:20.737 --> 13:24.038
I came up with some moves that I think
will be great for you. Check it out.

13:29.978 --> 13:32.547
Perfect! Wow. You're
a fast learner.

13:32.549 --> 13:34.448
Okay, let me show
you another one.

13:34.450 --> 13:37.018
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy, teach.

13:37.020 --> 13:39.120
I think that's enough
dancing for today.

13:39.122 --> 13:42.557
Plus, I'm starting to sweat,
and this robe is silk.

13:42.559 --> 13:45.193
Ooh, pickles!

13:46.461 --> 13:49.197
Austin!

14:15.591 --> 14:18.159
Okay, what the heck is going on?

14:20.762 --> 14:25.066
Oh, hey, guys. Don't mind me.

14:25.068 --> 14:28.035
I just hired a couple workers to
help with some home improvements.

14:28.037 --> 14:30.204
Home improvements?

14:30.206 --> 14:32.240
Yeah, I was feeling cramped,

14:34.344 --> 14:37.111
And open up the space a bit.

14:37.113 --> 14:39.680
I'm also installing
a tiny elevator

14:39.682 --> 14:43.150
that will deliver food from the
upstairs fridge right down to my bed.

14:43.152 --> 14:46.654
- What?
- Cool. I mean, what?

14:46.656 --> 14:49.323
Here, I'll show you my plans.

14:49.325 --> 14:52.093
That's it, he has got to go.

14:52.095 --> 14:54.729
You're right. I'll
get rid of him.

14:57.065 --> 14:59.433
Here are my designs. I'm
not married to anything,

14:59.435 --> 15:02.236
but for the floors,
I'm thinking birch.

15:02.238 --> 15:05.273
Look, Benny, we have to talk.

15:05.275 --> 15:07.208
Too rustic? I'm open to carpet.

15:07.210 --> 15:10.311
No, look, I'm bad at this stuff,

15:10.313 --> 15:13.080
so I'll just say what my mean
aunt Shelly used to say,

15:13.082 --> 15:16.384
"get your scrubby little
tush out of my petunias."

15:16.386 --> 15:18.719
Only in this case, the
petunias are the school

15:18.721 --> 15:22.189
and the scrubby
little tush is you.

15:22.191 --> 15:24.859
- You're kicking me out?
- Yeah.

15:24.861 --> 15:27.561
Wow, I thought you
guys were cool.

15:31.134 --> 15:32.199
I'll go pack.

15:43.412 --> 15:46.113
This has been the biggest
test of my patience ever,

15:46.115 --> 15:49.150
and that's saying a lot considering
I deal with you every day.

15:49.152 --> 15:52.453
Aww, that's the sweetest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

15:52.455 --> 15:55.723
I need to prove to myself
that I'm a great manager.

15:55.725 --> 15:57.725
And, for once, I'm
not gonna quit.

15:57.727 --> 16:00.461
I'm going to make those
guys love each other.

16:00.463 --> 16:03.664
- Give me back my hair gel. Yay!
- Give me that.

16:03.666 --> 16:05.733
Take the hair gel.

16:05.735 --> 16:09.303
All right, next exercise.
It's called "I feel."

16:09.305 --> 16:13.274
From now on you can only speak in
sentences that start with "I feel."

16:13.276 --> 16:17.345
Okay, I'll go first. I feel like Nigel
is the weakest member of the band.

16:17.347 --> 16:20.381
I feel like Rupert should
be thankful for auto-tune.

16:20.383 --> 16:22.149
His voice is rubbish.

16:22.151 --> 16:23.851
That's British for garbage.

16:23.853 --> 16:26.187
Guys, let's keep
it constructive.

16:26.189 --> 16:28.155
I feel hurt by your
negative words.

16:28.157 --> 16:30.324
Oh, yeah? Well, I feel like you
should be out of the band.

16:30.326 --> 16:32.393
I feel like we shouldn't
even have a band.

16:32.424 --> 16:33.594
I feel the same way.

16:33.596 --> 16:35.363
Great. We all finally
agree on something.

16:35.365 --> 16:37.898
Boynado is officially over.

16:37.900 --> 16:40.601
- Great.
- Yeah.

16:43.672 --> 16:47.608
I can't believe it. You let Boynado
break up. This is all your fault.

16:47.610 --> 16:49.677
- Dez.
- I'm sorry.

16:49.679 --> 16:53.881
I feel like you let Boynado break up.
This is all your fault!

17:01.189 --> 17:03.357
I can't believe
Boynado broke up.

17:03.359 --> 17:05.693
We lost the last great
American pop act.

17:05.694 --> 17:08.762
First of all, Boynado's
not American.

17:08.765 --> 17:10.731
Second, what about
Austin and Ally?

17:10.733 --> 17:14.201
Meh, I guess Austin's okay.

17:15.804 --> 17:18.305
I feel like a failure.

17:18.307 --> 17:20.340
Maybe I'm not cut out
to be a manager.

17:20.343 --> 17:24.811
Hey, a wise man once said,
"keep your head up, girl.

17:24.814 --> 17:27.314
"'Cause after the
rain, comes sun.

17:27.316 --> 17:29.383
Let's hit the beach
and have some fun."

17:29.385 --> 17:33.888
Are you seriously quoting
Boynado lyrics to me right now?

17:34.641 --> 17:37.491
Look, I think you're being
way too hard on yourself.

17:37.493 --> 17:39.593
If it wasn't for Rupert, the
band would still be together.

17:39.595 --> 17:41.228
He's the reason for
all the drama.

17:41.230 --> 17:45.232
Wait a minute, you're right.

17:45.234 --> 17:46.834
Rupert won't sit next to anyone.

17:46.836 --> 17:49.703
Rupert stole Nigel's hairstyle.

17:49.705 --> 17:51.806
Rupert thinks he's too
good for sound check.

17:51.808 --> 17:53.095
Typical bad boy.

17:53.126 --> 17:58.245
Yeah, and if I can find a replacement
for him, I could save Boynado.

17:58.247 --> 18:01.248
I thought you'd never ask.

18:12.662 --> 18:16.530
Wow, you have a lot
of Austin wigs.

18:16.532 --> 18:18.766
Well, you have a
lot of hairstyles.

18:18.768 --> 18:21.936
There's shaggy Austin, beachy
Austin, preppy Austin,

18:21.938 --> 18:25.439
- bad hair day Austin.
- Hey!

18:25.441 --> 18:27.975
Sorry, Bud. We all have 'em.

18:29.585 --> 18:31.545
I'm sorry it didn't work
out with you living here,

18:31.547 --> 18:33.747
but I still think you
have a lot of potential.

18:33.749 --> 18:35.316
You shouldn't give
up on your dreams.

18:35.318 --> 18:37.284
I'm the one who
should apologize.

18:37.286 --> 18:40.454
I was putting off dealing with my
future, and I got carried away.

18:40.456 --> 18:45.426
Being an Austin impersonator
was my passion, my calling.

18:51.700 --> 18:54.435
I was in your shoes once, too.

18:54.437 --> 18:57.705
When I couldn't make
music, I felt empty.

18:57.707 --> 19:00.641
But you've gotta keep trying.
You'll find something you love.

19:00.643 --> 19:04.044
You're right. I'm gonna
get my act together.

19:04.046 --> 19:05.946
I've procrastinated long enough.

19:05.948 --> 19:08.649
It's time to take control of my future.
I'll start next week.

19:10.051 --> 19:11.852
- Benny.
- Just kidding.

19:11.854 --> 19:12.887
I'll start right now.

19:12.889 --> 19:15.422
Hey, Trish.

19:15.424 --> 19:17.324
How's it going with Boynado?

19:17.326 --> 19:20.427
Terrible, but I think I
know how to solve it.

19:20.429 --> 19:25.032
Turns out all of Boynado's problems
trace back to one person... Rupert.

19:25.034 --> 19:27.535
Oh, Rupert's my favorite.

19:27.537 --> 19:31.438
Hello, ladies and gentleman.
We are Boynado.

19:31.440 --> 19:33.507
But more importantly,
I'm Rupert.

19:33.509 --> 19:36.443
Hit it, Janine.

19:42.784 --> 19:45.386
He is so good at that.

19:49.392 --> 19:52.860
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

19:52.862 --> 19:55.596
Ladies and gentleman, it
is my greatest pleasure

19:55.598 --> 19:59.633
to introduce the new and
much improved Boynado!

20:32.768 --> 20:35.936
Wow! Benny is killing
it up there.

20:35.938 --> 20:37.423
The real star tonight is Trish.

20:37.454 --> 20:41.542
She saved the day and proved once again
that she's the best manager in the biz.

20:41.544 --> 20:43.877
As if there was ever any doubt.

20:43.879 --> 20:46.547
By the way, Trish, did you book that
benefit concert we talked about?

20:46.549 --> 20:49.450
Of course.

20:49.452 --> 20:52.553
Note to self... book
Austin's benefit concert.

21:31.827 --> 21:35.062
I gotta say, it was a pretty brilliant
idea to put Benny in the band.

21:35.064 --> 21:37.031
I know. He fits in perfectly.

21:37.033 --> 21:38.999
You'd never know
Rupert was missing.

21:39.001 --> 21:40.200
What ever happened to Rupert?

21:40.202 --> 21:44.104
Hey, we're out of milk.

21:46.074 --> 21:48.842
Thanks again for letting
me crash here, Austin.

21:48.844 --> 21:50.711
Ooh, pickles.

21:50.713 --> 21:54.248
- Austin!
- I'm on it.

21:54.250 --> 21:57.818
Rupert, have you heard
of the expression,

21:57.820 --> 22:01.522
"get your scrubby little
tush out of my petunias"?
