I am so sorry I ruined
your garden, Star.

10:47.481 --> 10:49.881
You trusted me
with a secret and I blew it.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.983
You are forgiven,
friend Cyborg.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.386
You only wish to help
the friends in need.

10:54.388 --> 10:58.857
Now let us enjoy the peace
and quiet of this new garden.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.525
(ALL SIGHING DEEPLY)

11:01.227 --> 11:02.227
Howdy!
