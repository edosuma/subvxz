00:01.290 --> 00:03.030
- While a body has not been recovered,

00:03.030 --> 00:05.320
or a missing persons report filed.

00:05.320 --> 00:07.070
Gordon Pemberton's obituary

00:07.070 --> 00:10.010
has mysteriously surfaced
in the local Tribune.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.089
A written statement from sources close...

00:12.089 --> 00:14.839
(dramatic music)

00:20.847 --> 00:23.514
(gunshot bangs)

00:48.257 --> 00:50.590
- What the hell is going on?

01:07.823 --> 01:11.410
- Sorry boss, I, I should have knocked.

01:11.410 --> 01:13.403
- [?] He thought I was Vasser?

01:57.980 --> 01:59.340
78?

01:59.340 --> 02:01.679
I ain't paying for that!

02:01.679 --> 02:03.070
When you get some pants on.

02:03.070 --> 02:06.000
60 won't feel so bad.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.977
- Gosh dammit Vasser.

02:07.977 --> 02:09.810
- Cold in here.
- Yeah.

02:21.279 --> 02:23.862
(men mumbling)

02:54.998 --> 02:57.964
(banging from room)

02:57.964 --> 03:02.964
("Dance of the Sugar Plum
Fairy by Tchaikovsky)

03:09.933 --> 03:14.184
- Hey!
(knocking on door)

03:14.184 --> 03:16.241
- [Man] Relax, it's not Vasser.

03:16.241 --> 03:18.289
- What do you mean it's not Vasser?

03:18.289 --> 03:19.622
- [Woman] Oh no.

03:21.401 --> 03:22.234
Oh shoot.

03:23.921 --> 03:27.838
- What are you doing in
there with my daughter?

03:35.471 --> 03:37.051
What the hell?

03:37.051 --> 03:40.180
- Vasser, I promise, this
will be the last time.

03:40.180 --> 03:42.420
- How dare you.

03:42.420 --> 03:43.700
- It's okay Vasser,

03:43.700 --> 03:45.310
you would have done the same thing.

03:45.310 --> 03:46.890
- But that's my daughter!

03:46.890 --> 03:49.620
- Isn't that why you have so many Vasser?

03:49.620 --> 03:51.840
So you don't have to worry about one?

03:51.840 --> 03:53.370
- Many what?

03:53.370 --> 03:54.800
Many what?

03:54.800 --> 03:57.883
- It was like throwing a
sausage down the hallway.

03:59.460 --> 04:01.453
Anyway, I barely enjoyed it.

04:05.600 --> 04:08.662
- Daughter, we need to talk.

04:08.662 --> 04:11.245
(man coughing)

04:26.810 --> 04:28.832
- You know there was this one time

04:28.832 --> 04:30.820
I really wanted an ice cream cone

04:30.820 --> 04:33.070
but I didn't have enough
money to pay for it.

04:34.040 --> 04:34.873
- Yeah?

04:36.150 --> 04:36.983
- Yeah.

04:36.983 --> 04:38.040
So some guy bought it for me.

04:38.040 --> 04:40.420
- Did he have sex with you too?

04:40.420 --> 04:41.930
- Well, yeah.

04:41.930 --> 04:44.930
But that's not the point, the point is,

04:44.930 --> 04:46.800
he didn't have to get it for me,

04:46.800 --> 04:48.730
he already paid for the sex.

04:48.730 --> 04:49.613
- Paid for it?

04:53.080 --> 04:54.610
- Have you any decency?

04:54.610 --> 04:57.400
Making out with your own whore daughter?

04:57.400 --> 05:00.153
- You can't call this
sweet little person that.

05:01.270 --> 05:02.103
Wait!

05:03.090 --> 05:06.060
So you really are a whore!

05:06.060 --> 05:08.860
- Uh, we prefer escort.

05:08.860 --> 05:09.730
- We?

05:09.730 --> 05:10.763
- Prostitute.

05:11.710 --> 05:13.123
Slut is okay.

05:14.170 --> 05:17.851
Whore just feels kind of demeaning.

05:17.851 --> 05:19.020
- [Gordon Voiceover] I was shocked.

05:19.020 --> 05:22.160
I had no idea my mistaken
wife turned daughter

05:22.160 --> 05:25.080
was actually one of Vasser's prostitutes.

05:25.080 --> 05:28.430
Seems she was no more than
a business pawn for him.

05:28.430 --> 05:30.270
Car payments and money.

05:30.270 --> 05:33.210
That was all just
business as usual to her.

05:33.210 --> 05:34.630
This wasn't right.

05:34.630 --> 05:36.650
If I'm putting the pieces together

05:36.650 --> 05:39.020
Vasser adopted these
happy little daughters

05:39.020 --> 05:42.200
only to conceal his trafficking business.

05:42.200 --> 05:46.620
X number of dollars on paper,
meant X number of whores,

05:46.620 --> 05:48.950
I mean escorts.

05:48.950 --> 05:50.530
Uh, I don't quite remember.

05:50.530 --> 05:52.663
How did I hire you for this?

05:53.550 --> 05:58.203
All I did was go to Europe
for this U2 concert and well,

05:59.270 --> 06:03.483
let's just say a teen girl
should never vacation in Europe.

06:08.949 --> 06:11.699
(girls laughing)

06:13.399 --> 06:16.232
(girls screaming)

06:19.120 --> 06:23.367
- So what would it take to
put this life behind you?

06:23.367 --> 06:25.617
- $200,000.

06:27.670 --> 06:30.203
- Well that's a very specific number.

06:31.270 --> 06:32.920
- That's what the buyout is set at,

06:32.920 --> 06:35.620
like if you wanted to
purchase me exclusively,

06:35.620 --> 06:36.453
for you personally--

06:36.453 --> 06:38.670
- [Gordon Voiceover] If I
bought this sweet little person

06:38.670 --> 06:41.290
out of the chains of prostitution,

06:41.290 --> 06:43.483
that'd be every dollar of cash I have.

06:44.570 --> 06:47.537
I just don't know if I
care about her that much.

06:47.537 --> 06:49.300
200,000?

06:49.300 --> 06:50.660
Says who?

06:50.660 --> 06:52.063
Who set that price?

06:53.043 --> 06:54.413
- Sizzurp decided.

06:55.370 --> 06:56.203
- Sizzurp.

07:00.350 --> 07:04.001
- Wasn't it you who set
up all the terms with him?

07:04.001 --> 07:05.580
- Of course I did.

07:05.580 --> 07:06.993
- I hear he's difficult.

07:08.680 --> 07:10.130
- What's he look like?

07:10.130 --> 07:12.613
- I don't know, I've never seen him.

07:14.070 --> 07:15.213
But you should know.

07:17.678 --> 07:20.928
- You know I have a vault I could find.

07:21.960 --> 07:23.027
- What's in it?

07:23.027 --> 07:25.377
- $400 million dollars.

07:30.666 --> 07:32.307
- $400 million Dollars?

07:32.307 --> 07:36.150
I know right away what
I'd do with every penny.

07:36.150 --> 07:39.060
I don't know why people
go for big TVs and boats

07:39.060 --> 07:40.340
when they have money.

07:40.340 --> 07:42.423
Possessions don't lead to fulfillment.

07:43.360 --> 07:45.143
Possessing people doesn't either.

07:46.607 --> 07:48.870
- [Gordon Voiceover] For
such a tiny little person,

07:48.870 --> 07:52.120
she sure could spew a lot of garbage.

07:52.120 --> 07:55.213
I was almost going into a
coma listening to her yap.

07:55.213 --> 07:58.990
- $200,000 a girl wouldn't
seem so unrealistic.

07:58.990 --> 08:01.630
I could release every one of them.

08:01.630 --> 08:04.790
Even after they were free,
they could use the money

08:04.790 --> 08:08.156
for education, health care, vitamins,

08:08.156 --> 08:11.160
since our bones are so crisp.

08:11.160 --> 08:15.360
Even STD testing, I mean
some of their cranders

08:15.360 --> 08:18.593
are so inflamed, it's sickening.

08:20.564 --> 08:21.503
Our job sucks.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.843
(laughs) (clears throat)

08:25.843 --> 08:27.050
- Yeah.

08:27.050 --> 08:29.700
- What's even worse
though is all that money

08:29.700 --> 08:33.299
I'd be paying in would go
straight to that scumbag Sizzurp,

08:33.299 --> 08:35.640
who'd probably only invest
it back into the business

08:35.640 --> 08:37.732
to import a few hundred European tourists

08:37.732 --> 08:40.200
to replace us all.
- Okay, that's enough.

08:40.200 --> 08:43.370
- But I didn't get to the part
about martial arts lessons!

08:43.370 --> 08:45.470
It'd come in handy in dark parking lots

08:45.470 --> 08:47.907
so they'd never have to have any...

08:49.370 --> 08:52.580
- Why is the urgency for
this meeting Mr. Vasser?

08:52.580 --> 08:54.650
- Well first, could you please

08:54.650 --> 08:57.090
stop having sex with my daughter?

08:57.090 --> 08:59.460
It's just a little weird.

08:59.460 --> 09:01.140
- But you know what?

09:01.140 --> 09:03.720
It's absolutely meaningless sex.

09:03.720 --> 09:07.740
I have never cared about
anyone less in my life.

09:07.740 --> 09:12.100
If she died tomorrow, I don't
think I would really care,

09:12.100 --> 09:15.640
so it's gonna be easy for me to stop.

09:15.640 --> 09:18.110
- Relieved to hear that.

09:18.110 --> 09:21.273
- With all due respect, she's
just a worthless person.

09:22.391 --> 09:23.224
- Hey!

09:23.224 --> 09:25.763
You're talking about my daughter!

09:26.940 --> 09:28.500
- You know what?

09:28.500 --> 09:31.390
I think she's lovely.

09:31.390 --> 09:32.860
I really do.

09:32.860 --> 09:34.973
You couldn't find a nicer girl, yeah.

09:39.200 --> 09:42.663
- What do you know about
a guy they call Sizzurp?

09:44.900 --> 09:46.170
- Oh Sizzurp?

09:48.120 --> 09:52.520
The words that come to
mind are impenetrable,

09:52.520 --> 09:56.890
deadly, ruthless, 9nvisible, gosh.

09:56.890 --> 09:58.190
The man is not reasonable.

10:00.380 --> 10:05.380
- Wow, so as bad as the Mazda brothers?

10:06.070 --> 10:08.450
- You mean the Mesba brothers?

10:08.450 --> 10:11.140
Spreckin Load and Principal Palone?

10:11.140 --> 10:12.553
- Yep, them.

10:14.090 --> 10:15.950
- What's bad about them?

10:15.950 --> 10:20.950
- Uh, back to Sizzurp, how
close could we get to him?

10:21.910 --> 10:23.780
- How close are we talking?

10:23.780 --> 10:25.950
- Within range to kill him.

10:25.950 --> 10:28.270
Poison him, shoot him.

10:28.270 --> 10:31.740
I'm not fussy, but I need him dead.

10:31.740 --> 10:33.660
- I would not recommend that.

10:35.407 --> 10:37.860
- And why is that?

10:37.860 --> 10:40.410
- You double-crossed him before.

10:40.410 --> 10:42.400
They are on the lookout for you.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.213
You'd catch the first bullet.

10:45.220 --> 10:48.610
- Can you arrange a
friendly meeting with him?

10:48.610 --> 10:49.550
- Vasser?

10:49.550 --> 10:54.070
I assure you, there will
be no friendly meeting.

10:54.070 --> 10:56.623
Just blood, and mostly yours.

10:57.500 --> 10:58.803
- Are you sure?

10:59.680 --> 11:02.190
- If I find a way to get to Sizzurp

11:02.190 --> 11:05.050
without causing you death,
you'll be first to know.

11:05.050 --> 11:07.730
- Well that's all I can ask,

11:07.730 --> 11:10.180
but just out of curiosity, uh--

11:10.180 --> 11:11.310
- Yes boss?

11:11.310 --> 11:14.040
- If I happen to come up with a $200,000

11:14.040 --> 11:16.763
buy out for one of the girls Sizzurp has.

11:18.410 --> 11:21.323
who would I give the
money to to get it to him?

11:22.340 --> 11:23.823
- I would be able to do that.

11:24.775 --> 11:25.608
- Really?

11:26.729 --> 11:30.229
- I am neutral enough with
him to get away with it.

11:30.229 --> 11:31.463
I have my ways.

11:32.310 --> 11:34.980
- Just was curious.

11:34.980 --> 11:35.813
- Sure thing.

11:36.920 --> 11:37.870
- That will be all.

11:39.339 --> 11:42.939
(clearing throat)

11:42.939 --> 11:46.189
(Vasser snaps fingers)

12:04.876 --> 12:07.876
(cellphone ringing)

12:14.758 --> 12:15.591
- Hello?

12:15.591 --> 12:17.566
- [Man] Pelton?

12:17.566 --> 12:18.870
We should talk.

12:18.870 --> 12:21.230
- Gordon, Pelton died because of you!

12:26.155 --> 12:29.488
I don't know if you heard, about Gordon?

12:32.177 --> 12:33.650
- [Gordon Voiceover] If you only knew

12:33.650 --> 12:35.580
who you were talking to right now.

12:35.580 --> 12:40.580
- I feel bad because now we
can never make things right.

12:43.600 --> 12:45.773
- What do you mean make things right?

12:47.930 --> 12:50.170
- I should have talked to your brother

12:50.170 --> 12:52.693
after I learned he never killed you.

12:54.940 --> 12:59.940
You might already know but
something's happened to him.

13:02.397 --> 13:05.747
(snapping fingers)

13:05.747 --> 13:08.664
The reason I wanted to talk to you,

13:10.331 --> 13:13.403
your brother, is dead.

13:17.331 --> 13:19.930
Did you have anything to do with it?

13:21.800 --> 13:23.950
- Why would you ask me
something like that?

13:25.130 --> 13:27.813
- I just remember you two
didn't always get along.

13:29.290 --> 13:33.948
You only offered him that job
because I put you up to it.

13:33.948 --> 13:38.948
I don't exactly understand your
business, nor do I want to,

13:39.280 --> 13:44.280
but you've said death
is always in the air.

13:44.690 --> 13:47.190
- Gordon was the best employee I ever had

13:47.190 --> 13:49.233
now why would I kill myse, him.

13:52.255 --> 13:54.060
- Don't lie to me.

13:54.060 --> 13:55.623
You know my condition.

14:07.762 --> 14:08.595
Vasser.

14:09.923 --> 14:11.506
What are you doing?

14:25.210 --> 14:27.760
- How many times do I
have to tell you kids?

14:27.760 --> 14:29.723
Don't play so close to dad.

14:39.540 --> 14:42.790
- Will you tell us the story again dad?

14:44.890 --> 14:48.449
- How many times do we
have to hear that story?

14:48.449 --> 14:49.450
- Please?

14:49.450 --> 14:50.373
- Okay, fine.

14:53.660 --> 14:54.493
Double scotch.

14:55.640 --> 14:56.473
Rocks.

14:58.970 --> 15:02.180
So I saw your sexy mother at the bar.

15:02.180 --> 15:07.180
Her boyfriend at the time
was a 450-pound biker man

15:07.740 --> 15:12.240
and he struck me in the back
of the head with a frying pan.

15:12.240 --> 15:14.200
- How did he get a frying pan?

15:14.200 --> 15:17.750
- He's never changed it
to a frying pan before.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.951
- Okay, maybe it was a Vodka bottle.

15:20.951 --> 15:25.310
I don't know, I've never
told this story before!

15:25.310 --> 15:29.170
So after all that impact
to the back of my skull,

15:29.170 --> 15:31.123
I blacked out, immediately.

15:32.890 --> 15:36.070
They had my head all opened up in the back

15:36.070 --> 15:39.370
and they explained to me,
the back half of my skull

15:39.370 --> 15:41.630
was completely shattered.

15:41.630 --> 15:44.340
and they needed to remove the bone pieces,

15:44.340 --> 15:48.123
which would eventually
act and embed as shrapnel.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.560
The doctor gave me two choices.

15:51.560 --> 15:55.130
We can insert a plate,
but it will feel weird,

15:55.130 --> 15:57.300
or we can remove the shattered bone,

15:57.300 --> 16:00.410
leaving only skin against your brain.

16:00.410 --> 16:04.340
However if something as
petty as even a grape

16:04.340 --> 16:08.300
or an uncooked bean is flicked
at the back of your head,

16:08.300 --> 16:10.440
you'll die instantly.

16:10.440 --> 16:13.360
Both options are covered by your insurance

16:13.360 --> 16:14.710
because it's still the 90s.

16:16.882 --> 16:19.760
So I took the manly choice.

16:19.760 --> 16:21.227
- Yep, he sure did.

16:22.120 --> 16:24.720
- You opted not to have the metal plate?

16:24.720 --> 16:26.540
- You boys are acting like you never heard

16:26.540 --> 16:28.117
this story before!

16:30.549 --> 16:34.450
I know what you're gonna do
the second I turn my back.

16:41.741 --> 16:45.790
In a roundabout way, you
answered my question.

16:45.790 --> 16:48.810
Your ego has consumed you.

16:48.810 --> 16:51.090
My son Pelton is gone.

17:00.541 --> 17:01.374
- He is.

17:03.010 --> 17:04.413
I killed Pelton.

17:09.150 --> 17:09.983
- Gordon?

17:13.919 --> 17:17.240
Your mother's not around to miss me.

17:17.240 --> 17:18.240
Oh my gosh!

17:18.240 --> 17:19.230
She's dead!

17:20.749 --> 17:24.582
So if it vindicates you
somehow, you go ahead.

17:34.790 --> 17:36.753
- You should have gotten the plate.

17:53.815 --> 17:56.315
(bean clangs)

17:59.226 --> 18:03.960
(body thuds)
(people gasping)

18:03.960 --> 18:05.523
We aren't paying for this.

18:10.335 --> 18:12.085
- What are you doing?

18:13.650 --> 18:15.203
- I need to go for a drive.

18:18.060 --> 18:20.723
- Why don't you use your keys?

18:22.290 --> 18:24.590
- I can't find them anywhere.

18:24.590 --> 18:27.270
Nobody needs this many keys.

18:27.270 --> 18:30.420
Dump him in the deepest water around.

18:30.420 --> 18:32.363
Do you know where the spares are?

18:33.340 --> 18:36.123
- Control freaks don't make spares.

18:43.462 --> 18:45.962
(car hooting)

18:51.440 --> 18:52.980
- You remember Gordon?

18:52.980 --> 18:57.980
Well before he died, he showed
me this hilarious video.

18:58.490 --> 19:00.550
Would you like to see it?

19:00.550 --> 19:01.500
- Of course Vasser.

19:08.540 --> 19:11.190
(laughing)
(mumbling from video)

19:11.190 --> 19:14.836
He does the thing with the, (laughs).

19:14.836 --> 19:15.669
Oh, geez.

19:18.794 --> 19:19.627
Oh God.

19:20.704 --> 19:22.314
Oh God, that's good.

19:22.314 --> 19:25.741
Yep. (chuckles)

19:25.741 --> 19:27.991
Yep, yep that's funny, yep.

19:30.810 --> 19:34.970
- Not that it's any of my
business, but why wouldn't you

19:34.970 --> 19:39.600
watch that when Gordon
tried to show it to you?

19:39.600 --> 19:40.450
- How'd you know?

19:42.520 --> 19:45.423
- I hear everything that
goes on outside my door.

19:47.380 --> 19:49.730
- I didn't because we
hated Gordon, that's why.

19:53.420 --> 19:56.008
- We did, didn't we.

19:56.008 --> 19:56.841
- Who didn't.

19:56.841 --> 19:57.730
He was an idiot.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.730
Smartest thing you ever did was off him.

20:04.308 --> 20:06.860
Look at one of the perks I
picked up at one of our drops.

20:06.860 --> 20:07.940
Two VIP tickets.

20:07.940 --> 20:09.363
You want to go?

20:13.460 --> 20:15.490
Vasser, come on, we always go

20:15.490 --> 20:17.840
when we get tickets to
the crander extravaganza.

20:17.840 --> 20:20.213
Only 100 of these
tickets go out to people.

20:22.220 --> 20:23.773
- That'll be all Benson.

20:24.870 --> 20:25.830
- Dammit Vasser!

20:25.830 --> 20:28.230
Do you realize how many
cranders are gonna be there?

20:28.230 --> 20:31.120
Hundreds if not thousands of cranders!

20:31.120 --> 20:33.360
I can't go without you!

20:33.360 --> 20:35.860
That was the deal, if I brought Vasser,

20:35.860 --> 20:37.280
my tickets would be free.

20:37.280 --> 20:38.857
These are useless without you!

20:38.857 --> 20:41.190
- [Gordon Voiceover]
Denying him Crander Fest

20:41.190 --> 20:42.300
should have been enough.

20:42.300 --> 20:44.383
Good bye Benson.

20:52.517 --> 20:54.656
[Gordon Voiceover] But it wasn't.

20:54.656 --> 20:57.573
(gunshots banging)

21:05.137 --> 21:05.970
(intercom beeping)

21:05.970 --> 21:08.313
I have something you need to clean up.

21:10.186 --> 21:11.965
- [Man] You got it.

21:11.965 --> 21:14.632
(ominous music)

21:21.652 --> 21:22.485
- Hmm.

21:41.499 --> 21:43.540
- [Gordon Voiceover] I was Vasser.

21:43.540 --> 21:45.340
I could do anything.

21:45.340 --> 21:47.453
All it required was intimidation.

22:07.820 --> 22:10.710
(romantic music)

22:10.710 --> 22:12.913
Wow look at her.

22:23.600 --> 22:24.433
Hi.

22:26.750 --> 22:27.583
- Hi.

22:28.460 --> 22:32.403
- You wouldn't happen
to be single would ya?

22:33.626 --> 22:34.459
- Hey.

22:35.589 --> 22:36.613
That's my fiance.

22:40.510 --> 22:42.310
- So is she single?

22:42.310 --> 22:44.363
- No, I'm engaged to her.

22:45.400 --> 22:47.700
- Well, you see I was wondering

22:47.700 --> 22:51.340
because I wouldn't mind
getting her pregnant

22:52.291 --> 22:53.853
if you catch my drift.

22:55.930 --> 22:57.580
- Honey, a little help over here?

22:59.530 --> 23:01.273
- [Gordon Voiceover] I was Vasser.

23:01.273 --> 23:02.633
I could do anything.

23:04.010 --> 23:05.550
- Gee Joseph Hamburger's ghost.

23:05.550 --> 23:07.592
It's Vasser.

23:07.592 --> 23:08.425
- Vasser?

23:12.820 --> 23:14.930
- Uh, honey.

23:14.930 --> 23:17.350
I'm gonna go in the car.

23:17.350 --> 23:21.203
If you want him to get you
pregnant, by all means.

23:29.341 --> 23:32.924
(nostalgic romantic music)

23:45.490 --> 23:47.170
- [Gordon Voiceover] That
was just what I needed.

23:47.170 --> 23:48.523
Bring on the child support.

23:59.952 --> 24:02.535
All this booze, I want it free.

24:06.410 --> 24:08.150
- Just take it.

24:08.150 --> 24:11.793
- Listen here ya big ol'
box of flappin trout!

24:14.690 --> 24:16.657
- Is this a test Vasser?

24:20.130 --> 24:22.797
You're robbing yourself, Vasser?

24:28.293 --> 24:30.243
- This is my liquor store!

24:31.369 --> 24:32.638
- Right.

24:32.638 --> 24:35.843
- (laughs) And you're my employee!

24:36.720 --> 24:37.653
- Yes.

24:39.710 --> 24:44.710
- You uh got any extra money?

24:45.190 --> 24:46.243
- Sure!

25:03.330 --> 25:04.580
- More.

25:04.580 --> 25:07.330
- You feeling lazy today Vasser?

25:07.330 --> 25:12.033
Sums of over $10,000 you
usually get out of your vault.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.323
- The vault, here?

25:16.700 --> 25:18.260
In the store?

25:18.260 --> 25:21.217
- Do you have Alzheimer's Vasser?

25:21.217 --> 25:23.667
- [Gordon Voiceover] There
it was, Vasser's safe.

25:24.836 --> 25:26.336
400 million in it.

25:37.228 --> 25:38.228
Gosh dammit.

25:42.916 --> 25:44.430
- Gosh dammit Vasser!

25:44.430 --> 25:46.437
First you get me pregnant, now this!

25:49.685 --> 25:54.685
- Hey, you know that I
have one more test for ya.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.803
- Whatever you need Vasser.

25:57.890 --> 25:58.790
Here goes nothing.

26:00.805 --> 26:04.540
- Remember how I entrusted
the vault code to you

26:04.540 --> 26:07.683
should anything ever happen to me?

26:09.040 --> 26:12.463
- Of course I do, I
remember it as clear as day.

26:13.440 --> 26:17.350
- I need to make sure
that you still know it.

26:17.350 --> 26:18.900
- I made sure to keep the code

26:18.900 --> 26:22.650
secure and only open it in your presence,

26:22.650 --> 26:25.460
and heaven forbid should
death ever find you

26:25.460 --> 26:27.580
to transport all the money to a warehouse

26:27.580 --> 26:30.913
simply titled Polton Pougue
out of the Czech Republic.

26:33.472 --> 26:35.260
- [Gordon Voiceover]
This man was my ticket.

26:35.260 --> 26:37.230
I came here for the money

26:37.230 --> 26:39.630
but it looked like I
was gonna need a truck

26:39.630 --> 26:41.880
because I was leaving
with the whole shebang.

26:43.120 --> 26:44.063
400 million.

26:46.250 --> 26:48.203
- May I ask you a favor Vasser?

26:49.180 --> 26:51.103
- Yeah you may I s'pose.

26:53.100 --> 26:56.130
- Since I'm your loyal
servant and there's no need

26:56.130 --> 26:59.360
for violence given I'm
passing all of your tests.

26:59.360 --> 27:02.520
May I ask you put away the gun?

27:02.520 --> 27:04.027
- I bet you thought you were gonna die

27:04.027 --> 27:05.793
when I first had it out!

27:06.722 --> 27:10.751
- I kinda did! (laughs)

27:10.751 --> 27:14.501
- Testin ya!
(both laughing)

27:22.063 --> 27:23.084
(gunshot bangs)

27:23.084 --> 27:25.584
(tense music)

27:45.242 --> 27:46.992
Let's give it a shot.

27:48.114 --> 27:50.223
Gosh dammit!

28:13.200 --> 28:15.044
- This is bullshit!

28:15.044 --> 28:17.544
(tense music)

28:28.037 --> 28:30.277
Look at all the freebies I got.

28:30.277 --> 28:31.444
Look at this.

28:35.016 --> 28:37.970
- You didn't let him
get you pregnant did ya?

28:37.970 --> 28:39.146
- So what Jim?

28:39.146 --> 28:40.813
What does it matter?

28:54.524 --> 28:57.583
- [Gordon Voiceover] I guess
you could say I screwed up.

29:25.400 --> 29:27.723
- Nothing like fishing
out here with you Gordon.

29:34.920 --> 29:37.530
- You need me to pick up
anything from the store?

29:37.530 --> 29:39.940
- Not if I can pull this bad boy in!

29:39.940 --> 29:41.730
- You got us a big one?

29:41.730 --> 29:43.520
- Oh honey, it's insane!

29:43.520 --> 29:45.600
I'm gonna need your help
cleaning this sucker.

29:45.600 --> 29:47.773
- The fish we catch though, can't be beat.

29:49.270 --> 29:52.143
- At least here when it
washes up it's already dead.

30:01.450 --> 30:02.520
Never mind.

30:02.520 --> 30:03.513
Line snapped.

30:04.670 --> 30:06.263
- Gosh dammit honey.

30:23.430 --> 30:25.970
- [App voice] Television turned on.

30:25.970 --> 30:28.800
- Dead drug dealers are
turning up all around the city.

30:28.800 --> 30:30.970
Authorities say they're
all likely employees

30:30.970 --> 30:32.860
of kingpin Samuel Vasser.

30:32.860 --> 30:34.860
- Did you say they were
all shot in the head?

30:34.860 --> 30:36.320
- I wasn't done yet.

30:36.320 --> 30:38.243
Yes, they were all shot in the head.

30:39.706 --> 30:42.789
(announcer laughing)

30:45.150 --> 30:47.500
Investigators initially
thought the executions

30:47.500 --> 30:50.220
were brought forth in
opposition to Samuel Vasser,

30:50.220 --> 30:52.360
especially considering his personal chef

30:52.360 --> 30:54.020
was among those killed.

30:54.020 --> 30:56.510
The argument brings forth
the question, however,

30:56.510 --> 30:58.470
would he have commanded his own employees

30:58.470 --> 30:59.700
be shot in the head?

30:59.700 --> 31:01.210
- Shoot him in the head.

31:01.210 --> 31:02.590
- In the past, this has not been

31:02.590 --> 31:04.170
typical behavior for Vasser.

31:04.170 --> 31:07.670
- Haha, okay, let's say
for argument's sake,

31:07.670 --> 31:10.340
this was Samuel Vasser doing all of this,

31:10.340 --> 31:12.390
what an idiot he would be.

31:12.390 --> 31:14.850
Whose gonna transport all of his drugs?

31:14.850 --> 31:18.010
Pretty soon the income's gonna dry up!

31:18.010 --> 31:20.040
- He would be an idiot for doing that,

31:20.040 --> 31:21.510
that's why I said investigators

31:21.510 --> 31:22.930
don't believe it could be him.

31:22.930 --> 31:25.310
- You don't slapswat my boss!

31:25.310 --> 31:27.720
I do what he tells me to do, I
may not always understand it,

31:27.720 --> 31:29.793
but gosh dammit I do it.

31:30.660 --> 31:32.900
- Didn't you say they
were all shot in the head?

31:32.900 --> 31:33.733
- Gosh dammit.

31:33.733 --> 31:34.990
Why don't you shut the hell up

31:34.990 --> 31:38.201
and read the teleprompter
only when you're supposed to!

31:38.201 --> 31:42.110
- (laughs) In other news,
the notorious Mesba brothers,

31:42.110 --> 31:45.740
Principal Palone and
Spreckin Load were found dead

31:45.740 --> 31:48.350
outside of a warehouse in Moscow.

31:48.350 --> 31:49.653
- Do you know them or something?

31:49.653 --> 31:51.233
- [TV Announcer] I mean,
these crazy buttholes

31:51.233 --> 31:53.647
were the biggest drug
and sex traffickers--

31:54.530 --> 31:58.138
- Honey, keep my hamburger
beef in the oven.

31:58.138 --> 31:59.473
I'll be home soon.

32:02.879 --> 32:05.629
(doorbell rings)

32:18.588 --> 32:19.588
- Who is it?

32:21.410 --> 32:25.253
- Let me in, Gord, I mean Vasser.

32:26.129 --> 32:28.233
- [Gordon Voiceover] My
cover was finally blown.

32:29.110 --> 32:32.093
It was what he did with
it next that concerned me.

32:33.040 --> 32:35.973
- You want to see something funny?

32:38.187 --> 32:41.037
- [Gordon Voiceover] Felt like
so long since I saw Gabor.

32:54.140 --> 32:58.403
- I'm your friend, your
secret is safe with me.

33:02.330 --> 33:04.033
- Oh my gosh.

33:05.210 --> 33:09.713
You've no idea how happy I am
to talk freely to you again.

33:11.034 --> 33:13.823
I mean I have no one to talk to.

33:15.080 --> 33:19.670
- Yeah, you staged your
death and became Vasser.

33:19.670 --> 33:21.360
I get it.

33:21.360 --> 33:22.767
- We could be in on this!

33:22.767 --> 33:24.463
Just you and me.

33:28.360 --> 33:31.790
- And now you have it all.

33:31.790 --> 33:32.950
- Oh, I do!

33:32.950 --> 33:33.783
It's great.

33:33.783 --> 33:37.840
I mean, I can get away with anything.

33:37.840 --> 33:40.743
So there was this sexy milf at Vasser's,

33:42.020 --> 33:45.553
my liquor store and I
totally got her pregnant!

33:46.410 --> 33:48.523
- Well good for you!

33:49.560 --> 33:50.393
- I know!

33:50.393 --> 33:51.226
It's great!

33:52.060 --> 33:54.853
But I have no idea what I'm doing.

33:57.630 --> 33:58.783
Wait a second.

33:59.760 --> 34:02.510
How did you figure all this out?

34:02.510 --> 34:04.760
- I thought it was strange that Vasser

34:04.760 --> 34:07.443
wouldn't talk to me
since your disappearance.

34:22.550 --> 34:27.239
Because I know your
impression all too well.

34:27.239 --> 34:29.730
- To call me into his
office and is all like,

34:29.730 --> 34:31.780
Gordon, I'm not pleased.

34:31.780 --> 34:33.040
Why in the hell would you ever let--

34:33.040 --> 34:35.600
- That sounds just like Vasser!

34:35.600 --> 34:37.413
And then guess what washed up?

34:41.870 --> 34:42.929
Never mind.

34:42.929 --> 34:43.902
Line snapped.

34:45.020 --> 34:47.513
- I'm glad we're good.

34:48.800 --> 34:50.469
- We're not good.

34:50.469 --> 34:52.219
I thought you were dead.

34:52.219 --> 34:54.440
I went to your vigil.

34:54.440 --> 34:58.820
- It's crazy, I know, but
this has to stay between us.

34:58.820 --> 35:00.373
No one else knows.

35:01.440 --> 35:03.993
- And no one will ever know.

35:05.390 --> 35:07.430
- There's my best friend!

35:07.430 --> 35:08.373
I'm relieved.

35:10.220 --> 35:15.220
- And for $10,000, your new
world will stay a secret.

35:16.440 --> 35:17.603
- Excuse me?

35:19.170 --> 35:22.320
- Yeah $10,000.

35:22.320 --> 35:25.303
Ya know me and Betsy
got the new baby coming.

35:26.271 --> 35:27.400
It's a good deal.

35:27.400 --> 35:28.593
You should take it.

35:30.752 --> 35:31.840
- [Gordon Voiceover] I was wiping my ass

35:31.840 --> 35:34.290
with that kind of money last week,

35:34.290 --> 35:37.903
but with the income from Benson,
I can make that in no time.

35:40.680 --> 35:43.310
Wait, I killed him.

35:43.310 --> 35:44.560
Shoot.

35:44.560 --> 35:48.910
10k is actually an extremely
reasonable blackmail amount.

35:48.910 --> 35:51.400
It would help him and
little Betsy out greatly

35:51.400 --> 35:53.140
with the new kid.

35:53.140 --> 35:55.760
This would be so much easier
if it weren't so damn close

35:55.760 --> 35:57.960
to breaking into the
Tripledaughter reserve.

35:59.680 --> 36:02.093
You know, just out of curiosity.

36:03.330 --> 36:06.113
Would you have kept the
secret without the money?

36:07.310 --> 36:08.970
- You got the money.

36:08.970 --> 36:10.740
I know you do.

36:10.740 --> 36:12.303
- It's not about the money.

36:13.690 --> 36:18.500
- Without the money, word
will spread like wildfire.

36:18.500 --> 36:23.500
With the money, nothing
changes, it's pretty simple.

36:25.110 --> 36:27.060
Your man should have known,

36:27.060 --> 36:30.593
when you dump a body,
make sure it don't float.

36:31.710 --> 36:34.110
- You're not that Gabor I remember.

36:34.110 --> 36:37.210
We were best friends.

36:37.210 --> 36:39.083
- My best friend died,

36:40.040 --> 36:43.173
but I can be very good
friends with Vasser again.

36:48.010 --> 36:49.583
- I'll need to see a body.

36:59.171 --> 37:01.080
[Gordon Voiceover] I had
to give him the money.

37:01.080 --> 37:03.382
I knew I did and that's
what I was gonna do.

37:03.382 --> 37:05.882
(tense music)

37:12.360 --> 37:15.420
- Right over here, this is
about where I reeled 'er her in.

37:15.420 --> 37:16.820
- [Gordon] I got a question.

37:17.930 --> 37:20.007
Did you know about Pelton?

37:20.920 --> 37:22.370
- [Gabor] Just me and Benson.

37:23.609 --> 37:26.270
(gunshot bangs)

37:26.270 --> 37:28.080
- [Gordon Voiceover] What did I do?

37:28.080 --> 37:31.320
No, I didn't pull that trigger.

37:31.320 --> 37:33.248
I had my mind made up.

37:33.248 --> 37:35.915
- Gordon, you died before I did.

37:51.482 --> 37:52.860
- [Gordon Voiceover] I had it all.

37:52.860 --> 37:57.443
The power, the life, and now
a vehicle in which I had keys.

38:12.725 --> 38:15.392
(intense music)

38:47.350 --> 38:49.840
Big problem after a few weeks.

38:49.840 --> 38:52.690
I noticed I had no sale
leads without Vasser

38:52.690 --> 38:54.770
or Benson to tell me where to go.

38:54.770 --> 38:58.763
However the fear in the
community was all I needed.

39:00.650 --> 39:04.340
So what if I killed off
all of Vasser's peddlers?

39:04.340 --> 39:06.130
They were worthless.

39:06.130 --> 39:08.250
They hand delivered my income,

39:08.250 --> 39:10.813
but aside from that, worthless.

39:12.000 --> 39:16.000
But it was beneath me to go
and sell the drugs myself.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.083
That was behind me.

39:18.330 --> 39:20.290
I own this town.

39:20.290 --> 39:24.720
Once I burned through that
200,000 Tripledaughter reserve,

39:24.720 --> 39:26.490
which probably could last me years

39:26.490 --> 39:29.960
if I ate a lot of fast food
and didn't pay for sex,

39:29.960 --> 39:33.450
I could threaten local
businesses for security.

39:33.450 --> 39:35.600
Like the old mob movies.

39:35.600 --> 39:37.093
It'd be hilarious.

39:42.170 --> 39:43.643
What was the meaning of this?

39:45.470 --> 39:47.813
- I've been shot eight times.

39:48.800 --> 39:49.633
Careful!

39:51.240 --> 39:53.660
- Let's be honest, you kinda deserve it

39:53.660 --> 39:57.540
after you dumped Va, I mean Gordon's body

39:57.540 --> 40:00.257
in such shallow water.

40:00.257 --> 40:04.090
(gunfire banging in distance)

40:05.988 --> 40:09.663
(exhaling) People are trying to kill me.

40:11.610 --> 40:12.443
- Weird.

40:14.160 --> 40:15.627
- Why would they do that?

40:17.100 --> 40:19.273
- Because you're Vasser.

40:22.265 --> 40:23.098
- Right.

40:29.260 --> 40:32.035
- It might have something to
do with the hit man I hired.

40:32.035 --> 40:32.868
- Hit man?

40:34.295 --> 40:36.537
- I'm sorry Samuel, but you have to die.

40:39.040 --> 40:39.873
- Why?

40:47.520 --> 40:48.920
- That's complicated,

40:48.920 --> 40:50.253
we can work that out.

40:51.380 --> 40:52.213
- Oh yeah?

40:52.213 --> 40:54.210
You still screwing your daughter?

40:54.210 --> 40:55.043
- No!

40:56.450 --> 41:00.573
- I don't know, you're
with her an awful lot.

41:02.610 --> 41:03.863
- I can explain.

41:05.470 --> 41:07.547
- He's at the front door.

41:07.547 --> 41:09.720
(tense music)
(gunshots banging)

41:09.720 --> 41:10.553
Hey!

41:10.553 --> 41:11.870
Don't shoot him in here!

41:11.870 --> 41:12.703
Hey!

41:12.703 --> 41:13.604
You know how hard it is

41:13.604 --> 41:15.240
to sell a house after
someone's died in it?

41:15.240 --> 41:17.440
I'll never get the blood
out of the carpets!

41:20.800 --> 41:24.290
- I hereby represent the
family of Spreckin Load.

41:24.290 --> 41:25.840
They have paid me to bring the head

41:25.840 --> 41:28.982
of Vasser to them so
they can urinate on it.

41:28.982 --> 41:31.910
(comical music)

41:31.910 --> 41:33.540
- Vasser!

41:33.540 --> 41:35.770
- Now who the hell are you?

41:35.770 --> 41:38.822
- I hereby represent the
family of Principle Palone.

41:38.822 --> 41:41.650
They have paid me to bring the
head of Samuel Vasser to them

41:41.650 --> 41:43.823
so the family birds can peck at it.

41:44.970 --> 41:47.030
- Well that sounds awful!

41:47.030 --> 41:49.140
- I called dibs on his head first!

41:49.140 --> 41:52.120
- You did, I heard it,
but the family who paid us

41:52.120 --> 41:55.223
requires his head as the
capstone of their revenge.

41:56.160 --> 41:57.610
- You don't understand though,

41:57.610 --> 41:59.580
he's only got one head to sever.

41:59.580 --> 42:02.060
- I'm standing right here.

42:02.060 --> 42:04.290
- His head is also needed to satisfy

42:04.290 --> 42:06.883
the celebration of Spreckin Load's legacy.

42:07.910 --> 42:10.373
- What if we both separate
his head and split it?

42:11.260 --> 42:12.930
- There is two ways to do it.

42:12.930 --> 42:14.983
Either horizontally or vertically.

42:16.070 --> 42:17.793
- I'm still right here.

42:19.100 --> 42:22.890
- I say vertically is simply
off the table because you would

42:22.890 --> 42:25.150
have a clamshell effect going on.

42:25.150 --> 42:27.330
- But then there is an issue.

42:27.330 --> 42:29.026
Horizontal.

42:29.026 --> 42:33.997
In which you would have all the eyes.

42:33.997 --> 42:36.450
- Do you not agree we have a mutual

42:36.450 --> 42:38.530
interest of killing Samuel Vasser?

42:38.530 --> 42:40.160
- That we do.

42:40.160 --> 42:43.450
- I propose this, we
team up on killing him,

42:43.450 --> 42:45.660
ensuring our shot is twice as good.

42:45.660 --> 42:46.580
- Deal.

42:46.580 --> 42:48.820
Let's shoot him, then negotiate the head.

42:48.820 --> 42:50.410
- Don't forget about me!

42:50.410 --> 42:51.710
I need to kill Vasser too!

42:54.260 --> 42:55.220
- He's on foot!

42:55.220 --> 42:56.053
Fire!

42:56.053 --> 42:59.329
(gunfire blasting)

42:59.329 --> 43:01.829
(tense music)

43:28.879 --> 43:30.368
- [Woman] Yes Vasser?

43:30.368 --> 43:32.290
- I need to leave town.

43:32.290 --> 43:33.980
- [Woman] New identity?

43:33.980 --> 43:34.813
- Check.

43:35.650 --> 43:38.773
- I can call a guy, who knows a guy,

43:40.092 --> 43:41.392
who will call another guy.

43:42.870 --> 43:44.050
- Set it up.

43:44.050 --> 43:44.883
- Okay.

43:46.191 --> 43:47.560
- Vasser!
- Vasser!

43:59.180 --> 44:00.778
- Is everything okay?

44:00.778 --> 44:02.890
- Everybody's trying to kill me!

44:02.890 --> 44:04.990
- Sorry to hear that.

44:04.990 --> 44:08.020
Do you want to go someplace and chat?

44:08.020 --> 44:11.823
- That'd be great, but
where is there a safe place?

44:14.270 --> 44:16.803
- There's this playground
down by the sewer plant.

44:17.660 --> 44:19.940
- Sounds stinky.

44:19.940 --> 44:21.290
- It is.

44:21.290 --> 44:22.630
Worse than this.

44:22.630 --> 44:25.170
That's why no one ever goes there.

44:25.170 --> 44:26.313
- Sounds good.

44:28.860 --> 44:30.520
- I thought we were done here.

44:30.520 --> 44:31.833
I ain't paying for him.

44:41.038 --> 44:42.621
- Is that guy dead?

44:44.280 --> 44:45.113
- Yes.

44:47.600 --> 44:48.913
- What about his dog?

44:50.660 --> 44:51.690
- Yeah.

44:51.690 --> 44:53.333
The emissions caught up to them.

44:56.229 --> 44:57.570
- Are we safe?

44:57.570 --> 44:59.823
- The cloth-pins act as filters.

45:03.400 --> 45:04.550
You have to leave town?

45:06.090 --> 45:07.013
- Yeah.

45:08.883 --> 45:11.203
I'm afraid it's come to that.

45:12.690 --> 45:14.327
- But you're my only friend.

45:15.270 --> 45:18.243
- I am a terrible person to
have as your only friend.

45:20.420 --> 45:21.773
- When will you be back?

45:23.330 --> 45:26.733
- After today, you may never see me again.

45:27.710 --> 45:29.757
- Can I ask where you're going?

45:32.090 --> 45:35.283
- It's so secret, even I
don't know where I'm going.

45:37.620 --> 45:40.713
New name, fresh start.

45:42.530 --> 45:47.530
- Before you go, since I
may never see you again,

45:49.320 --> 45:51.510
any word on finding Sizzurp?

45:53.300 --> 45:54.320
- Gosh dammit!

45:54.320 --> 45:56.710
If my right-hand man
says he can't be found,

45:56.710 --> 45:59.260
then I damn well believe
he can't be found.

45:59.260 --> 46:00.250
Give it up already!

46:00.250 --> 46:01.083
Okay?

46:01.083 --> 46:02.480
- You're right.

46:02.480 --> 46:04.753
You've done enough for me as it is.

46:08.459 --> 46:10.240
- Look, if you want to deal with Sizzurp,

46:10.240 --> 46:12.493
you do it yourself, okay?

46:13.620 --> 46:15.543
- But no one's ever seen him.

46:16.990 --> 46:19.440
You're the only one who
knows what he looks like.

46:21.216 --> 46:22.560
- [Gordon Voiceover] If
Vasser's the only one

46:22.560 --> 46:26.660
who knew what he looked like,
she's definitely screwed.

46:26.660 --> 46:28.491
We'll never find him.

46:28.491 --> 46:29.324
That's for sure.

46:31.770 --> 46:35.250
- If you want, you could say goodbye

46:35.250 --> 46:37.713
to the rest of your
daughters before you go.

46:38.622 --> 46:41.763
It's been so long since we've seen you.

46:44.440 --> 46:47.023
Especially if you're
gonna be gone for a while.

46:52.411 --> 46:53.710
- [Gordon Voiceovers] Wow.

46:53.710 --> 46:57.880
More lovely G-U-R-L's just like her.

46:57.880 --> 46:59.443
I could barely imagine.

47:08.521 --> 47:10.000
But who was I kidding?

47:10.000 --> 47:11.033
I couldn't go there.

47:12.130 --> 47:13.950
This Sizzurp was in charge over there

47:13.950 --> 47:16.030
and he wants Vasser dead,

47:16.030 --> 47:19.023
not to mention he's
demanding 200,000 a girl.

47:19.970 --> 47:22.972
That's not realistic
spending from me right now.

47:22.972 --> 47:25.555
(gentle music)

47:27.080 --> 47:30.113
This may be a little bit off-topic,

47:30.113 --> 47:33.393
but you are adopted, right?

47:35.460 --> 47:37.037
- Yeah?

47:37.037 --> 47:40.290
- [Gordon Voiceover] By moral
standards there was absolutely

47:40.290 --> 47:42.243
no reason why we couldn't be together.

47:43.150 --> 47:45.590
So what if she's my daughter on paper?

47:45.590 --> 47:46.423
It's just paper.

47:47.270 --> 47:49.013
I knew I had to take her with me.

48:04.324 --> 48:06.991
(girl laughing)

48:49.310 --> 48:50.763
You should come away with me.

48:51.990 --> 48:54.267
There's no reason you can't.

48:54.267 --> 48:55.683
- But I'm your daughter.

48:56.760 --> 48:59.597
- It doesn't matter, you're adopted.

48:59.597 --> 49:01.163
- But what about your wife?

49:02.150 --> 49:03.610
- She doesn't like me anymore,

49:03.610 --> 49:05.333
and you're a consenting adult.

49:07.100 --> 49:07.933
- Well.

49:07.933 --> 49:09.473
- Well what?

49:11.120 --> 49:13.123
- I'll be 16 in a few months.

49:15.620 --> 49:18.547
- I didn't understand what you just said.

49:19.787 --> 49:22.113
You're 18 right?

49:23.640 --> 49:24.927
- No.
- Aargh.

49:26.561 --> 49:27.480
- [Gordon Voiceover]
Well that nix the plan

49:27.480 --> 49:29.260
of her coming along.

49:29.260 --> 49:31.670
That just wasn't gonna happen now.

49:31.670 --> 49:33.963
That was her fault, not mine.

49:39.532 --> 49:42.199
(phone buzzing)

49:45.750 --> 49:47.390
- Hello?

49:47.390 --> 49:50.191
- [Man] I heard from
Jeffrey Zinkin that for $60

49:50.191 --> 49:52.863
you let him stick his
fingers in your butt.

49:53.730 --> 49:56.773
Since I'm a referral, I was
wondering if you'd go to 40?

49:58.812 --> 50:00.145
- No, I'm sorry.

50:02.213 --> 50:04.330
- [Gordon Voiceover] It was
like nails on a chalkboard

50:04.330 --> 50:06.343
hearing her negotiate her butt.

50:08.770 --> 50:11.900
- Um, okay.

50:11.900 --> 50:14.090
- [Gordon Voiceover] I
knew what I had to do,

50:14.090 --> 50:16.903
but it was gonna be tough.
- Yes, 6 p.m. works.

50:18.860 --> 50:21.670
Okay, yeah.

50:21.670 --> 50:23.640
Behind a barn is fine.

50:23.640 --> 50:25.210
- [Gordon Voiceover] I just
couldn't let her go forward

50:25.210 --> 50:26.893
with such a demeaning life.

50:31.470 --> 50:32.920
I want you to have something.

50:43.236 --> 50:44.069
$200,000.

50:45.759 --> 50:48.160
It's enough to set you free.

50:48.160 --> 50:49.860
It's not enough to do all that stuff you

50:49.860 --> 50:52.137
wanted to do with the rest of those girls.

50:52.137 --> 50:55.679
The STD testing, insurance, kickboxing,

50:55.679 --> 50:57.503
you know all that crap.

50:59.271 --> 51:00.104
- What?

51:00.104 --> 51:00.937
I thought--

51:00.937 --> 51:02.803
- Take it, it's only right.

51:05.220 --> 51:06.811
- For real?

51:06.811 --> 51:07.644
- You just give that to Parasnov.

51:08.700 --> 51:13.620
He lives at my house, he said
he could get it to Sizzurp.

51:13.620 --> 51:15.890
- You're not buying me for anyone?

51:15.890 --> 51:17.350
- Nobody.

51:17.350 --> 51:18.703
You're buying yourself.

51:21.020 --> 51:25.417
- No one's ever done anything
like this for me before.

51:27.121 --> 51:27.954
- [Gordon Voiceover] I kissed

51:27.954 --> 51:30.010
my Tripledaughter reserve goodbye.

51:30.010 --> 51:33.900
It melted my heart seeing
how grateful she was.

51:33.900 --> 51:36.030
There was no doubt in my mind

51:36.030 --> 51:37.783
this was the right thing to do.

51:38.650 --> 51:42.820
Well, what would make it even
more right is if all the money

51:42.820 --> 51:44.570
didn't have to go right to Sizzurp.

51:52.160 --> 51:54.970
At least this meant she
could turn away from her life

51:54.970 --> 51:57.983
of sexual deviance
Vasser cemented her into.

51:59.200 --> 52:01.513
I never did anything nicer in my life.

52:02.620 --> 52:04.720
I didn't need the money where I was going.

52:09.283 --> 52:11.249
(cellphone buzzing)

52:11.249 --> 52:13.749
That's what I was waiting for!

52:29.120 --> 52:30.270
Shit!

52:30.270 --> 52:32.220
I shouldn't give him that money to her!

52:34.430 --> 52:37.763
You're a sweet little
person but I need that!

52:41.174 --> 52:42.007
- What?

52:43.273 --> 52:46.490
- This whole relocation
thing, I don't know how much

52:46.490 --> 52:48.397
it's all gonna cost, but it won't be cheap

52:48.397 --> 52:50.653
and I can't risk getting stuck in town.

52:51.890 --> 52:53.090
I won't last a day here.

52:56.770 --> 52:57.603
- Right.

53:00.550 --> 53:02.170
- I hope you understand.

53:03.303 --> 53:04.653
- That was a funny joke.

53:07.031 --> 53:08.653
- Right, it was a joke.

53:09.580 --> 53:10.530
- Have a safe trip.

53:25.610 --> 53:26.443
- Bye!

53:32.983 --> 53:36.733
[Gordon Voiceover] I
tried one last run down.

53:37.760 --> 53:41.280
Everything could be different
if this would just open.

53:41.280 --> 53:42.940
I could hire an army of security

53:42.940 --> 53:45.393
and set all of Vasser's escorts free.

53:46.610 --> 53:47.790
(metal clanging)
Wow.

53:47.790 --> 53:49.123
Never heard that before.

54:03.318 --> 54:06.060
- You were never a runner
when goings got tough before.

54:06.060 --> 54:10.431
You leave town now, consider
all your operations kaput.

54:10.431 --> 54:12.253
Sizzurp will take us over.

54:13.484 --> 54:15.380
He'll rule the market.

54:15.380 --> 54:17.773
Your empire will crash.

54:18.917 --> 54:21.617
- [Gordon Voiceover] Not the
way I pictured going out.

54:22.550 --> 54:24.563
I lost it as fast as I gained it.

54:27.080 --> 54:27.913
- Vasser?

54:28.950 --> 54:29.783
You there?

54:31.110 --> 54:32.360
- I'm listening.

54:32.360 --> 54:36.190
- You leave, transfer stops, supply stops,

54:36.190 --> 54:40.123
money stops, they'll know you skipped.

54:41.540 --> 54:44.090
You'll be dead to anyone
who was ever loyal to you.

54:45.162 --> 54:46.370
- [Gordon Voiceover] I could stay here,

54:46.370 --> 54:48.950
hope for the best and die trying.

54:48.950 --> 54:50.350
It's my survival that matters.

54:50.350 --> 54:52.580
Not a dead man's legacy.

54:52.580 --> 54:54.170
Easy come, easy go.

55:08.050 --> 55:10.550
(tense music)

56:06.850 --> 56:07.933
- We're here.

56:35.570 --> 56:37.323
There she is.

56:41.507 --> 56:43.593
- That's it?

56:44.730 --> 56:47.681
- Yeah, hope you weren't
expecting the Ritz-Carlton.

56:47.681 --> 56:49.540
Boost that enthusiasm.

56:49.540 --> 56:51.430
After all, this is
where you'll be spending

56:51.430 --> 56:53.573
the rest your life the way it sounds.

56:54.700 --> 56:57.080
It's nicer inside though.

56:57.080 --> 56:58.380
Not any any warmer though.

57:01.110 --> 57:03.930
- Where's your water purification system?

57:03.930 --> 57:05.720
- This ain't your mansion anymore.

57:05.720 --> 57:08.210
You got a creek out there for water,

57:08.210 --> 57:10.430
just beyond the second gate.

57:10.430 --> 57:11.820
- Outside?

57:11.820 --> 57:12.653
For what?

57:12.653 --> 57:15.290
What's wrong with the sinks in this place?

57:15.290 --> 57:16.800
- There aren't any.

57:16.800 --> 57:19.290
- What exactly is there to do around here?

57:19.290 --> 57:20.123
I mean.

57:22.980 --> 57:24.770
- There are some books.

57:24.770 --> 57:25.603
- Books?

57:26.480 --> 57:28.610
All I see is a Bible over there.

57:28.610 --> 57:30.620
- There were many books in the Bible.

57:30.620 --> 57:32.133
- Well I hate that kind of stuff.

57:32.133 --> 57:35.070
I mean, I can't even read that good.

57:35.070 --> 57:37.003
- I already anticipated that.

57:40.412 --> 57:42.512
I mean is there even a VCR for this stuff?

57:43.660 --> 57:44.493
The Mask?

57:45.732 --> 57:47.253
Two copies?

57:49.990 --> 57:50.823
Yeah okay.

57:51.860 --> 57:53.500
- One is in widescreen,

57:53.500 --> 57:56.090
I figured you'd like to catch up on it.

57:56.090 --> 57:58.770
I hear they're making a reboot.

57:58.770 --> 58:00.550
They're bringing back Drew Carey?

58:00.550 --> 58:03.068
- Probably not, it is a reboot.

58:03.068 --> 58:04.610
- Oh this is crap.

58:04.610 --> 58:09.368
This is all just a bunch of crap!

58:09.368 --> 58:10.293
All of this!

58:16.757 --> 58:17.590
- Hey!

58:27.150 --> 58:29.253
Just what do you think you're doing?

58:29.253 --> 58:30.310
- [Gordon Voiceover] He may have tried,

58:30.310 --> 58:32.531
but nobody could tell me what to do.

58:32.531 --> 58:33.364
- Hey!

58:34.652 --> 58:35.833
Hey!

58:35.833 --> 58:36.666
Hey!

58:37.526 --> 58:38.359
Hey!

58:39.243 --> 58:40.702
Hey!

58:40.702 --> 58:41.952
Hey!

58:41.952 --> 58:42.785
Hey!

58:44.072 --> 58:44.905
Hey!

58:51.232 --> 58:52.065
Hey!

58:53.151 --> 58:53.984
Hey!

58:56.251 --> 58:57.918
Hey!
- Entertainment.

59:00.755 --> 59:01.588
- Hey!

59:03.283 --> 59:04.116
Hey!

59:05.472 --> 59:06.305
Hey!

59:10.101 --> 59:10.934
Hey!

59:12.620 --> 59:13.453
Hey!

59:16.654 --> 59:17.570
Hey!

59:17.570 --> 59:18.403
Hey!

59:24.690 --> 59:25.523
- Sorry.

59:28.650 --> 59:31.907
- Just to dry up any
ill-conceived notion of leaving,

59:31.907 --> 59:34.210
let me give you a little play-by-play

59:34.210 --> 59:35.583
of how things would go.

59:37.270 --> 59:40.790
In the stolen car from the
village 18-miles from here,

59:40.790 --> 59:42.120
you can skip town, you can get through

59:42.120 --> 59:44.610
two states, maybe three.

59:44.610 --> 59:46.830
The weather gets a little warmer.

59:46.830 --> 59:49.010
You make a few stops, you start to think

59:49.010 --> 59:51.867
yeah I'm invincible and home free.

59:51.867 --> 59:54.520
You stop to refuel your rear wheel drive,

59:54.520 --> 59:57.210
there you've encountered
someone or multiple people

59:57.210 --> 59:58.470
that you've done wrong.

59:58.470 --> 01:00:00.930
The peace they've been
seeking unfortunately comes

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:04.040
at the contingency that
there's a bullet in your head.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:06.670
Just what are the odds of
running into these people

01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:07.790
at this gas station?

01:00:07.790 --> 01:00:10.870
Well, odds like that are so
desolate, they don't exist.

01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:13.110
Even then with your grisly appearance,

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:15.820
they know who you are and soon
exactly where you're going.

01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:18.970
So you tell me, does
that sound like a future?

01:00:18.970 --> 01:00:19.970
No?

01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:23.090
Well it shouldn't because
the story ends with you dead

01:00:23.090 --> 01:00:26.673
from blood loss staring face
up at a ventilation system.

01:00:28.550 --> 01:00:31.579
- So uh, where's the TV?

01:00:31.579 --> 01:00:33.580
- Cathode ray tubes can be tracked

01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:35.673
by military-grade devices.

01:00:38.437 --> 01:00:42.133
- It's freezing in here,
please tell me we got heat.

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:45.980
- That looks like a trusty
stove back there don't it?

01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:46.960
- Sure does.

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:47.813
- Well, it's not.

01:00:47.813 --> 01:00:49.400
It's Fisher-Price.

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:51.030
- Can I use that radio?

01:00:51.030 --> 01:00:53.560
- If you can get it to
work all the power to you.

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:56.540
Wouldn't bother though, the only station

01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:59.650
within 70-miles from here
is a Christian station.

01:00:59.650 --> 01:01:01.610
- To hell with that.

01:01:01.610 --> 01:01:03.227
I won't even bother.

01:01:03.227 --> 01:01:05.580
- There may come a time
where you want to hear

01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:08.006
some voices than your own.

01:01:08.006 --> 01:01:09.670
- I don't think that's gonna happen.

01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:11.350
- I should be on my way to pick up

01:01:11.350 --> 01:01:13.923
some French desserts for Bernie Madoff.

01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:17.555
Anything else while I'm here?

01:01:17.555 --> 01:01:19.790
- I think you covered it pretty well.

01:01:30.174 --> 01:01:32.841
(intense music)

01:02:46.443 --> 01:02:49.360
(melancholy music)

01:03:01.592 --> 01:03:03.253
Kinda wish you were here right now.

01:03:04.984 --> 01:03:06.992
I also wish you were little older.

01:03:06.992 --> 01:03:11.820
Then I really, really wish
you were here right now.

01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:16.333
But I mean, it doesn't matter
'cause you're not, but...

01:04:21.384 --> 01:04:22.884
This was the life.

01:04:39.130 --> 01:04:43.190
- [Gabor Voiceover] I had
a family, now I'm dead.

01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:45.895
Who's gonna support them now?

01:04:45.895 --> 01:04:48.510
If it weren't for your damn Vasser ego

01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:50.930
I'd still be alive and
pushing the daughter

01:04:50.930 --> 01:04:53.413
I never got to meet on a swing.

01:05:01.112 --> 01:05:01.945
- Ow!

01:05:09.034 --> 01:05:11.130
[Gordon Voiceover] I was
losing all will to live.

01:05:11.130 --> 01:05:14.280
Staying alive, so Gordon, Vasser,

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:16.423
whoever I was anymore was pointless.

01:05:17.290 --> 01:05:19.670
He never did anything for anyone,

01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:22.563
and what could he do
for anyone if he lived?

01:05:24.730 --> 01:05:26.680
- [Man] I killed a giraffe.

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:28.630
- [Woman] I murdered my husband.

01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:30.310
- [Man] I didn't pay for the cookies.

01:05:30.310 --> 01:05:32.810
- [Man] I had an opportunity
to buy my estranged adopted

01:05:32.810 --> 01:05:36.170
daughter out of prostitution but I didn't.

01:05:36.170 --> 01:05:39.120
- [Man] What do all these
people have in common?

01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:41.040
Jesus forgave all of them.

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:45.620
It really doesn't matter how
bad the things we've done are.

01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:47.610
Jesus paid the price.

01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:50.657
We just need to admit how crunchy we are.

01:06:37.402 --> 01:06:40.440
- Hey!

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:42.800
It cools down pretty good at night.

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:43.893
Remember what I was saying before?

01:06:43.893 --> 01:06:45.793
You get some insulation going,

01:06:45.793 --> 01:06:48.213
you can stay warm up
here through anything.

01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:51.020
You ready to get fat?

01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:54.280
You're opening that pizza box
like there's a salad in there!

01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:56.340
Slam it down!

01:06:56.340 --> 01:06:57.440
Let me ask you again!

01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:58.673
You ready to get fat?

01:07:01.330 --> 01:07:03.343
Get your cholesterol rising.

01:07:07.413 --> 01:07:09.117
- [Man On Radio] This
is senator Bill Cosby,

01:07:09.117 --> 01:07:10.606
just wanted to say,

01:07:10.606 --> 01:07:14.523
if God can forgive me,
then he can forgive you!

01:07:19.517 --> 01:07:21.130
- [Gordon Voiceover] I sometimes
wondered how things were

01:07:21.130 --> 01:07:23.077
back in town without Vasser.

01:07:24.371 --> 01:07:25.871
- Let's try again.

01:07:26.733 --> 01:07:29.250
(gun clicks)
(woman groans)

01:07:29.250 --> 01:07:31.430
- [Man On Radio] And
admit our sins to him.

01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:35.054
If you trust Jesus with
your sins and problems,

01:07:35.054 --> 01:07:40.054
guilt and anxiety will be
replaced with unexplainable peace.

01:07:52.850 --> 01:07:56.400
We should realize we're
all powerless to sin.

01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:58.026
We just keep doing it.

01:07:58.026 --> 01:08:01.930
That's why Jesus died so
we can find our definition

01:08:01.930 --> 01:08:05.771
in his perfection and
not our own sinful past.

01:08:05.771 --> 01:08:08.571
You know that the young people
(knocking on door)

01:08:08.571 --> 01:08:10.011
they just don't understand --

01:08:10.011 --> 01:08:12.100
- Who's there?

01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:13.093
I can't see.

01:08:22.899 --> 01:08:25.540
- Cholesterol is insane.

01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:28.370
Probably from eating nothing but crap.

01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:30.103
Your blood pressure is way up too.

01:08:31.279 --> 01:08:34.330
- My daughter's been on
my mind a lot lately.

01:08:34.330 --> 01:08:36.053
- Can't do anything from out here.

01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:39.580
Well I hate to be the bearer of bad news,

01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:44.399
but uh, yeah, you got Type 2 diabetes.

01:08:44.399 --> 01:08:45.670
- How is that possible?

01:08:45.670 --> 01:08:47.490
- Yeah, you packed on so much weight

01:08:47.490 --> 01:08:49.740
I mean a lot of things are gonna happen.

01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:51.500
Eye pressure is gonna go to hell.

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:54.300
- Is that why my eyesight got so bad?

01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:56.323
- Yep, not good at all.

01:08:57.290 --> 01:08:59.560
- I thought you said it
would be a good idea to gain

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:03.060
a little weight, you know,
with the heating situation.

01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:05.200
- Not sure who told you that.

01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:07.033
You knew that heater worked right?

01:09:09.090 --> 01:09:12.720
I was just kidding before
about it being Fisher-Price.

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:14.240
It's just made cheap.

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:16.870
- It can't be tracked
by military aircraft?

01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:18.103
- Who told you that?

01:09:20.279 --> 01:09:21.113
All right.

01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:24.223
You're gonna need these.

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:30.694
Picked up the whole African
donation bin from Walgreens.

01:09:30.694 --> 01:09:33.147
I have no idea what your
prescription is, you wanna...

01:09:33.147 --> 01:09:34.397
- These'll work.

01:09:34.397 --> 01:09:35.868
- Good.

01:09:35.868 --> 01:09:39.452
I'll just take the rest
of these back then.

01:09:43.029 --> 01:09:44.850
- What?
(man mumbling)

01:09:44.850 --> 01:09:45.939
Shut up, English.

01:09:45.939 --> 01:09:47.291
(speaks foreign language)

01:09:47.291 --> 01:09:48.309
What are you talking about?

01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:50.629
I can't understand you.

01:09:50.629 --> 01:09:53.036
(man speaks foreign language)
English!

01:09:53.036 --> 01:09:55.393
It's where you're at, English.

01:09:57.180 --> 01:09:58.893
Shut up, English please.

01:10:00.119 --> 01:10:00.952
English!

01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:06.720
- Why did you leave?

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:08.127
You were my only friend.

01:10:09.250 --> 01:10:11.110
- What if Vasser came back?

01:10:11.110 --> 01:10:13.060
- He's too worried
about protecting himself

01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:15.800
to care about anyone else.

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:16.913
- Gordon's different.

01:10:18.170 --> 01:10:20.400
- Gordon is Vasser.

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:24.253
They became one and the
same a long time ago.

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:28.563
- Well I'd love to prove you wrong,

01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:33.199
but I'm too far gone.

01:10:33.199 --> 01:10:35.060
- [Father Voiceover] Maybe
Gordon needs to be the father

01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:36.743
Vasser never was.

01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:41.990
There's nothing so bad
you could have done.

01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:43.023
- Says who?

01:10:46.490 --> 01:10:48.297
If Vasser has all these daughters,

01:10:48.297 --> 01:10:51.993
then why does he only
have a picture of you?

01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:56.113
- I was his first escort when
he got into the business.

01:10:57.730 --> 01:11:01.853
He liked me because I
was soft and squeezy.

01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:05.563
He'd buy me cupcakes on my birthday.

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:10.837
I was his favorite.

01:11:27.257 --> 01:11:28.257
- Hey there!

01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:30.970
I really missed you.

01:11:30.970 --> 01:11:33.093
Wow such a great guy.

01:11:35.208 --> 01:11:36.853
- Knock it off ya tadpole!

01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:42.690
Just like you requested.

01:11:42.690 --> 01:11:44.210
Two empty.

01:11:44.210 --> 01:11:45.043
One full.

01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:52.083
Off and on to the next mission.

01:11:53.790 --> 01:11:54.960
- Please!

01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:57.960
I haven't had a real
conversation in years.

01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:01.220
I'll give you an extra 500.

01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:03.720
I've been thinking a lot
about my daughter lately.

01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:09.903
- Yeah, she sure is sexy.

01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:12.283
- Many men think so.

01:12:13.710 --> 01:12:15.153
- Oh look, I win.

01:12:16.190 --> 01:12:17.510
Good game.

01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:18.473
Thanks for the...

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:20.753
- Wait.

01:12:28.957 --> 01:12:31.503
- I thought we agreed to the 500?

01:12:33.308 --> 01:12:35.110
(Gordon sighs)

01:12:35.110 --> 01:12:36.380
What do you want me to do with that?

01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:39.090
- Will you give it to my little daughter?

01:12:39.090 --> 01:12:41.943
So she'll stop having
sex with men for money.

01:12:44.650 --> 01:12:49.443
- Now if I said yes, would you believe me?

01:12:50.471 --> 01:12:51.610
- [Gordon Voiceover] There it was,

01:12:51.610 --> 01:12:54.193
the untouched Tripledaughter reserve.

01:12:55.050 --> 01:12:59.190
I managed to have enough
stray cash to keep it intact.

01:12:59.190 --> 01:13:02.940
Now I could do what I should
have done a long time ago.

01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:04.190
Please?

01:13:04.190 --> 01:13:05.283
It's all I have.

01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:08.533
- This is everything that you have?

01:13:09.410 --> 01:13:10.243
- Everything.

01:13:11.806 --> 01:13:14.330
- Let me ask you this.

01:13:14.330 --> 01:13:16.140
If you can no longer pay me,

01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:19.083
what reason do I have
to come back here again?

01:13:28.217 --> 01:13:30.360
That's a lot of trust.

01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:31.437
You know that?

01:13:33.310 --> 01:13:35.060
- I know you'll do the right thing.

01:13:58.466 --> 01:14:00.750
[Gordon Voiceover] I was going delirious.

01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:04.350
Six days late on my care package.

01:14:04.350 --> 01:14:08.090
Hadn't had a bite of
anything in five days.

01:14:08.090 --> 01:14:10.930
In retrospect, I never
should have told him

01:14:10.930 --> 01:14:12.930
I had no more money.

01:14:12.930 --> 01:14:14.820
He probably didn't see any dollar signs

01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:16.950
anymore in coming here.

01:14:16.950 --> 01:14:19.450
I was either gonna stay here and die,

01:14:19.450 --> 01:14:22.750
or I could brave the
elements and go to town.

01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:25.750
Thank goodness I still had this weight.

01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:27.070
Gave me a fighting chance

01:14:27.070 --> 01:14:28.950
walking to the next town.

01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:32.203
If I was more normal weight, I
would surely freeze to death.

01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:34.793
I had a secret.

01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:38.093
Once I got fat enough to brave the cold.

01:14:38.954 --> 01:14:40.700
I snuck out once a year

01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:43.510
to the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.

01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:46.460
The Iditarod Butt Sled Race.

01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:48.710
It was only three miles from the cabin.

01:14:48.710 --> 01:14:52.113
With the hood up tight, I
was assured to never be seen.

01:14:53.090 --> 01:14:55.330
Those dogs were so beautiful.

01:14:55.330 --> 01:14:58.780
Gosh, even without the open flame,

01:14:58.780 --> 01:15:03.580
those beefy dogs made me remember
the last time I had meat.

01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:05.020
I knew it was wrong,

01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:08.240
but I couldn't help but
picture them charbroiled.

01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:09.970
If you saw them in person,

01:15:09.970 --> 01:15:13.430
you'd never forget Green Belch, Seabottom,

01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:18.120
Slap-Top Nacho, Thunder
Bottle, and my favorite,

01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:19.503
Spoonfed Racehorse.

01:15:35.250 --> 01:15:39.661
Speaking of, after the
longest walk of my life,

01:15:39.661 --> 01:15:40.953
I needed food.

01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:01.387
- Looks like you really
like that popcorn huh?

01:16:08.490 --> 01:16:11.610
- Sorry, I haven't eaten in days.

01:16:11.610 --> 01:16:12.760
I don't have any money.

01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:17.573
- Are you okay?

01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:22.343
- Sorry, you remind me of someone.

01:16:26.410 --> 01:16:28.031
- Well that's nice.

01:16:28.031 --> 01:16:29.550
Who?

01:16:29.550 --> 01:16:30.383
- My daughter.

01:16:31.930 --> 01:16:35.150
- Oh.

01:16:35.150 --> 01:16:37.750
Come on up to the bar, I'll
make you a drink, on me.

01:16:42.442 --> 01:16:43.800
What are you drinking?

01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:45.720
- Whatever you recommend.

01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:48.070
- What about a Spoonfed Racehorse?

01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:49.170
- Yeah!

01:16:49.170 --> 01:16:51.820
- You know why we call it
a Spoonfed Racehorse right?

01:16:52.710 --> 01:16:57.110
- Race dog 23, greyhound,
pure Appalachian.

01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:58.290
Pure beef!

01:16:58.290 --> 01:17:01.590
Snout carved like a wood pinch horn.

01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:03.233
- Somebody goes to the races.

01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:05.173
- Every year.

01:17:15.181 --> 01:17:16.598
I'm really sorry.

01:17:17.910 --> 01:17:19.160
- You miss her don't you?

01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:24.323
- There's some things I
waited too long to do.

01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:27.363
I'm sure she's doing well by now.

01:17:28.210 --> 01:17:30.560
There be some things I
should have done sooner.

01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:33.850
- What father doesn't say that?

01:17:35.530 --> 01:17:38.130
- Even though I did the right thing now,

01:17:38.130 --> 01:17:39.930
I'll bet she hates me.

01:17:39.930 --> 01:17:41.530
- When did you last talk to her?

01:17:42.390 --> 01:17:44.180
- Just over three years ago.

01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:45.880
- You should call her.

01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:47.823
- There's something we used to do.

01:17:49.893 --> 01:17:51.920
- What's that?

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:52.823
- Can I show you?

01:17:55.620 --> 01:17:56.453
- Sure.

01:17:57.570 --> 01:17:58.403
- You sure?

01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:00.093
- I trust you.

01:18:25.113 --> 01:18:26.113
- I'm sorry.

01:18:27.629 --> 01:18:28.970
- This guy bothering you?

01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:32.643
- Um, I don't like this guy at all.

01:18:34.650 --> 01:18:36.400
- Finish that drink be on your way.

01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:41.923
- Is there any chance
I can use your phone?

01:18:59.419 --> 01:19:02.336
(melancholy music)

01:19:22.817 --> 01:19:24.600
- Thank you for calling
the suicide hotline.

01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:25.910
Don't try anything yet.

01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:27.590
Jesus loves you.

01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:29.637
We'll be with you in just a hot second.

01:19:29.637 --> 01:19:33.790
(coughing) What do you need? (coughing)

01:19:33.790 --> 01:19:34.623
- Huh?

01:19:40.077 --> 01:19:42.923
- What's going through
your mind right now?

01:19:43.890 --> 01:19:45.730
- I've tried everything.

01:19:45.730 --> 01:19:47.233
Nothing works.

01:19:48.770 --> 01:19:53.560
I've got more pills in me
than a Mexican pharmacy.

01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:55.656
- You called the right place.

01:19:55.656 --> 01:19:58.433
You are going to be okay.

01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:01.640
- I don't want to be okay.

01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:03.810
- What I need you to do is gag yourself,

01:20:03.810 --> 01:20:06.190
over a bathtub, a sink, a toilet.

01:20:06.190 --> 01:20:07.533
- So I can throw up?

01:20:08.618 --> 01:20:10.910
That just seems counterproductive.

01:20:10.910 --> 01:20:13.258
What kind of suicide hotline is this?

01:20:13.258 --> 01:20:14.340
(call waiting beeping)

01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:15.173
Screw it.

01:20:16.838 --> 01:20:18.458
Hello?

01:20:18.458 --> 01:20:19.291
- Beezy.

01:20:25.301 --> 01:20:26.384
Are you okay?

01:20:28.570 --> 01:20:29.903
- I wouldn't say so.

01:20:31.380 --> 01:20:32.780
- Life should be good.

01:20:32.780 --> 01:20:34.343
You got the money right?

01:20:35.330 --> 01:20:36.163
- Money?

01:20:38.117 --> 01:20:40.991
- $200,000.

01:20:40.991 --> 01:20:43.643
- I'm not in the mood for
another one of your jokes.

01:20:44.570 --> 01:20:48.020
My stomach's bleeding so
bad it hurts to laugh.

01:20:48.020 --> 01:20:50.943
- You're still having
sex with strange men?

01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:54.210
- What else would I be doing?

01:20:54.210 --> 01:20:56.797
It's not like I'm cut
out for anything else.

01:20:56.797 --> 01:20:58.090
- [Gordon Voiceover] That relocater man

01:20:58.090 --> 01:20:59.633
never got her the money.

01:21:00.645 --> 01:21:02.710
I trusted him.

01:21:02.710 --> 01:21:04.500
I was suckered!

01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:07.633
No wonder he never came
again to bring me food.

01:21:09.410 --> 01:21:10.723
Listen, I'm sorry, I tried--

01:21:10.723 --> 01:21:13.810
- You left when I needed you the most.

01:21:13.810 --> 01:21:15.763
You only cared about yourself.

01:21:16.890 --> 01:21:19.060
- Well I had a lot of time to think.

01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:20.700
I became aware of many things.

01:21:20.700 --> 01:21:23.193
- You missed three birthdays.

01:21:24.070 --> 01:21:26.230
- I'm really sorry.

01:21:26.230 --> 01:21:29.260
- I thought my birthday
was important to you.

01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:30.183
- It is.

01:21:31.250 --> 01:21:32.620
- Out of all your daughters,

01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:35.590
mine was the only one you ever celebrated.

01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:37.510
How could you forget it?

01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:40.300
- I don't have access to postal facilities

01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:41.670
or gift shops here.

01:21:41.670 --> 01:21:43.590
- You always said that there was something

01:21:43.590 --> 01:21:45.760
special about my birthday.

01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:47.083
- How could I forget?

01:21:48.110 --> 01:21:49.303
Your birthday.

01:21:51.700 --> 01:21:53.933
- He'd buy me cupcakes on my birthday.

01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:56.703
I was his favorite.

01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:00.490
- [Gordon Voiceover] I
can make everything right,

01:22:00.490 --> 01:22:04.180
but I just had to find a
way to ask her when it was.

01:22:04.180 --> 01:22:05.760
But in some fashion that wouldn't

01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:06.963
hurt her feelings.

01:22:07.890 --> 01:22:09.640
When is your birthday?

01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:10.513
I forgot.

01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:14.770
- I did too, after all
the memory wiping drugs

01:22:14.770 --> 01:22:17.723
your men packed into me
after that U2 concert.

01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:23.160
I simply knew my birthday

01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:25.307
as the day I got a cupcake from you.

01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:32.420
- My wife is in the driveway!

01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:33.253
Damn it!

01:22:33.253 --> 01:22:34.110
- I appreciate the call

01:22:34.110 --> 01:22:37.480
but I have to go.
- Dammit!

01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:40.443
- Listen Beezy, everything
will be okay soon.

01:22:49.817 --> 01:22:51.060
[Gordon Voiceover] How could I let

01:22:51.060 --> 01:22:52.933
this poor little friend down again?

01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:55.693
- [Beezy] You always said
that there is something

01:22:55.693 --> 01:22:58.559
special about my birthday.

01:22:58.559 --> 01:23:01.226
(frantic Music)

01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:47.510
- [Man] In the stolen car from the village

01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:50.170
18-miles from here, you skip town.

01:23:50.170 --> 01:23:52.007
You get through two states.

01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:55.720
- [Gordon Voiceover] I
hadn't slept in days,

01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:58.360
but I was never more propelled.

01:23:58.360 --> 01:23:59.583
I had things to do.

01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:02.790
- [Man] The weather gets a little warmer.

01:24:02.790 --> 01:24:03.840
You make a few stops.

01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:07.513
You start to think, yeah,
I'm invincible and home-free.

01:24:12.799 --> 01:24:13.710
- [Gordon Voiceover] Well I'll be!

01:24:13.710 --> 01:24:16.053
The old Bawvardy Gawk is still here!

01:24:19.793 --> 01:24:20.830
- [Electronic Voice]
Enter weight loss details

01:24:20.830 --> 01:24:23.240
to get in shape for your little friend.

01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:26.057
You only need to burn 560,432 calories

01:24:29.070 --> 01:24:30.820
to reach your weight-loss goal.

01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:33.203
- Come on, you are not fat!

01:24:34.086 --> 01:24:36.580
- [Electronic Voice] This will
take several days by bike.

01:24:36.580 --> 01:24:38.303
- I'm over 18 now!

01:24:42.710 --> 01:24:45.524
- Come on, you can do it!

01:24:45.524 --> 01:24:48.191
(intense music)

01:25:26.006 --> 01:25:28.350
- [Gordon Voiceover] Time to
get some clothes that will fit,

01:25:28.350 --> 01:25:30.550
that will also make me
look like an old man.

01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:34.103
Now to follow this mystery napkin.

01:25:38.470 --> 01:25:40.983
Off into the umble nodes of Fantrateen.

01:25:40.983 --> 01:25:43.900
(mysterious music)

01:26:40.900 --> 01:26:41.822
- Hey.

01:26:41.822 --> 01:26:42.655
- Hey.

01:26:44.460 --> 01:26:47.750
So, uh, who is that guy?

01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:49.070
- Who knows.

01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:51.561
It's the masked no condom
ones you worry about.

01:26:51.561 --> 01:26:53.250
Don't know who they are.

01:26:53.250 --> 01:26:56.300
There's nothing worse
than an infected crander.

01:26:56.300 --> 01:26:58.731
- At least the guy was
wearing a rubber, am I right?

01:26:58.731 --> 01:27:00.660
(laughing)

01:27:00.660 --> 01:27:03.610
- When an inflamed bowling
pin goes into your crander,

01:27:03.610 --> 01:27:05.060
I'd like to see you laughing.

01:27:07.460 --> 01:27:08.960
- Oh where can I find Sizzurp?

01:27:10.373 --> 01:27:11.570
- If you have a complaint,

01:27:11.570 --> 01:27:13.730
we can take care of things right now.

01:27:13.730 --> 01:27:14.563
- [Gordon] No!

01:27:14.563 --> 01:27:16.070
No complaints.

01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:17.900
- Then what do you have for him?

01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:18.900
- [Gordon] A bullet.

01:27:22.390 --> 01:27:24.050
- You'll never find him.

01:27:24.050 --> 01:27:25.063
He's a ghost.

01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:30.190
- Did Vasser come around here a lot?

01:27:30.190 --> 01:27:31.730
- Only to lure away police.

01:27:31.730 --> 01:27:33.130
- Police know about this?

01:27:33.130 --> 01:27:35.180
- In which he'd always get off scot-free.

01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:39.240
- We have reason to believe
that what you're trying

01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:43.853
to pass off as a campground,
is actually a sex traffic ring.

01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:47.900
One of your clients who
admitted that after leaving

01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:50.930
one of your strip clubs,
was asked if he wanted

01:27:50.930 --> 01:27:55.930
to go camping and was
subsequently directed here.

01:27:56.750 --> 01:27:58.857
- There may be some lewd behavior here,

01:27:58.857 --> 01:28:01.990
but what my daughters do
on their camping trips

01:28:01.990 --> 01:28:06.040
is no concern of mine and
shouldn't be any of yours.

01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:07.600
I own this property

01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:11.140
and as far as I'm concerned it's private.

01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:12.033
- Daughters?

01:28:16.140 --> 01:28:17.480
- This is interesting.

01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:21.130
Checked all the ID's of the
girls back there, and you're not

01:28:21.130 --> 01:28:23.880
gonna believe this, they all
have the last name Vasser.

01:28:25.220 --> 01:28:28.060
And I checked out in the
system and it is correct.

01:28:28.060 --> 01:28:30.237
Can't arrest him for bad parenting.

01:28:32.289 --> 01:28:34.130
- But do me a favor,

01:28:34.130 --> 01:28:38.643
tell your daughters to
keep their pants on.

01:28:40.770 --> 01:28:44.023
- Well of course, but it's never easy.

01:28:47.180 --> 01:28:50.810
- But can you tell me where
someone named Beezy is?

01:28:50.810 --> 01:28:52.020
- [Woman] She should be here.

01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:53.083
Her car's out there.

01:28:54.390 --> 01:28:55.850
- I should go look for her.

01:28:55.850 --> 01:28:56.683
- Don't leave.

01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:00.510
- Wait.

01:29:00.510 --> 01:29:01.353
How old are you?

01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:03.670
- 15.

01:29:03.670 --> 01:29:05.030
- Damn that Sizzurp.

01:29:06.563 --> 01:29:08.480
- Wait, that'll be $11!

01:29:15.456 --> 01:29:16.289
- Vasser!

01:29:17.510 --> 01:29:19.016
You came!

01:29:19.016 --> 01:29:21.140
- Shh.

01:29:21.140 --> 01:29:22.707
I'm gonna get you out of here.

01:29:22.707 --> 01:29:25.280
- But I'm not authorized
to leave right now.

01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:26.350
- Shh!

01:29:26.350 --> 01:29:29.525
- But they raised the buyout price!

01:29:29.525 --> 01:29:30.940
- To what?

01:29:30.940 --> 01:29:33.725
- It's 500,000 now.

01:29:33.725 --> 01:29:34.700
- Sizzurp raised it?

01:29:34.700 --> 01:29:37.390
- When you left, he took over your market.

01:29:37.390 --> 01:29:39.370
He changed everything.

01:29:39.370 --> 01:29:42.613
There's no competition,
it's just like Walmart.

01:29:51.060 --> 01:29:52.860
- So you're not my daughter anymore?

01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:54.913
- Nope.

01:29:57.180 --> 01:29:58.653
- Is your car that blue one?

01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:01.913
- Yeah?

01:30:03.070 --> 01:30:04.420
- I know where your car is.

01:30:06.070 --> 01:30:09.440
I want to be in that
passenger seat at midnight.

01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:10.660
- Really?

01:30:10.660 --> 01:30:12.440
- I have some things I have to do first

01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:14.163
and they've gotta be done.

01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:21.407
Things will be okay
whether I show up or not.

01:30:23.323 --> 01:30:24.156
- [Man] You almost done?

01:30:24.156 --> 01:30:26.841
That's my favorite crander!

01:30:26.841 --> 01:30:28.601
(punch thuds)
Ow!

01:30:28.601 --> 01:30:32.393
I swallowed a tooth! (coughs)

01:30:32.393 --> 01:30:34.810
- Bye!
- I swallowed a tooth.

01:30:49.708 --> 01:30:51.243
- [Gordon Voiceover] I
could see they weren't home.

01:31:00.150 --> 01:31:01.187
- Why are you here?

01:31:01.187 --> 01:31:04.818
- [Gordon Voiceover] Ah,
they must have just got home.

01:31:04.818 --> 01:31:07.093
They most certainly weren't here before.

01:31:08.130 --> 01:31:11.580
- I know the truth that
I'll never be able to prove.

01:31:11.580 --> 01:31:13.800
Do you know what that's like?

01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:15.373
Do you even know who you are?

01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:19.440
- I'm here as Gordon.

01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:21.180
- I'd take Vasser any day,

01:31:21.180 --> 01:31:23.380
at least he wouldn't
have killed my husband.

01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:28.070
What did you come here for?

01:31:38.159 --> 01:31:39.280
- [Gordon Voiceover] I know Gabor himself

01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:41.570
would have wanted to do this,

01:31:41.570 --> 01:31:43.503
but this was the best I could offer.

01:31:44.850 --> 01:31:46.483
I'm sorry I killed your dad.

01:31:48.928 --> 01:31:50.595
- [Girl] You did it?

01:31:50.595 --> 01:31:52.705
- Yep, I did it.

01:31:52.705 --> 01:31:57.008
- [Girl] I would've liked to have met him.

01:31:57.008 --> 01:32:01.063
- And because of me you never will.

01:32:08.380 --> 01:32:10.787
That was one gun I refused to unload.

01:32:12.933 --> 01:32:14.954
- [Girl] I forgive you.

01:32:14.954 --> 01:32:17.104
- [Gordon Voiceover] Go ahead, do it.

01:32:17.104 --> 01:32:18.724
- Want to know my name?

01:32:18.724 --> 01:32:20.224
- No, that's okay.

01:32:22.132 --> 01:32:23.640
- [Gordon Voiceover]
Nobody could have given her

01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:24.573
a clearer shot.

01:32:28.210 --> 01:32:30.823
Same couldn't be said for
my time in their bathroom.

01:32:32.850 --> 01:32:35.513
I hadn't used a real
porcelain bowl in years.

01:32:48.710 --> 01:32:51.553
I'm uh, I'm gonna go.

01:32:59.220 --> 01:33:00.810
I peed all over the floor in there.

01:33:00.810 --> 01:33:05.570
Ya know I couldn't find a
towel, but, tried to use

01:33:05.570 --> 01:33:08.382
your shower curtain and
it's made from this,

01:33:08.382 --> 01:33:13.382
this vinyl material, and it
didn't soak any of it up.

01:33:20.342 --> 01:33:22.259
Oh, I parked out front.

01:33:24.569 --> 01:33:26.860
- [Man] You stop to refuel
your rear wheel drive,

01:33:26.860 --> 01:33:29.700
there you've encountered
someone or multiple people

01:33:29.700 --> 01:33:30.830
that you've done wrong.

01:33:30.830 --> 01:33:33.280
The peace they've been
seeking unfortunately comes

01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:36.121
at the contingency that's
there a bullet in your head.

01:33:36.121 --> 01:33:37.760
- [Woman] Your guy's lids are too big!

01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:40.510
(women laughing)

01:33:43.663 --> 01:33:45.770
- [Man] Just what are the
odds of running into these

01:33:45.770 --> 01:33:47.703
people at this gas station?

01:33:47.703 --> 01:33:50.400
Odds like that are so
desolate, they don't exist.

01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:53.061
They couldn't possibly know it's you.

01:33:53.061 --> 01:33:55.310
- [Gordon Voiceover] They
don't remember what you did.

01:33:55.310 --> 01:33:56.303
It's been too long.

01:33:58.090 --> 01:34:00.213
They can't know it's you.

01:34:00.213 --> 01:34:01.963
You have a beard now.

01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:05.150
They probably just dropped those slushees

01:34:05.150 --> 01:34:07.823
because they have carpal
tunnel from texting a lot.

01:34:10.130 --> 01:34:11.123
Time to go.

01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:15.610
They probably got so much inheritance,

01:34:15.610 --> 01:34:17.163
they forgot about everything.

01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:21.550
- Remember we hired you!

01:34:21.550 --> 01:34:23.760
- To kill Vasser's drug dealer Gordon.

01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:25.060
- He's back in town!

01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:26.450
- The one who killed our father!

01:34:26.450 --> 01:34:28.050
- Our dad's dead because of it.

01:34:28.050 --> 01:34:31.170
- He messed with our breakfast delights!

01:34:31.170 --> 01:34:33.323
And he's got a beard now.

01:34:34.220 --> 01:34:36.370
- I'm on it, tell me where he is.

01:34:36.370 --> 01:34:37.660
- He's in a car.

01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:38.493
- Going west.

01:34:38.493 --> 01:34:39.530
- Maybe north.

01:34:39.530 --> 01:34:40.440
- Black Lexus.

01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:41.790
- He's got a beard now.

01:34:41.790 --> 01:34:43.803
- [Man] Even then with your
grizzly appearance, they know

01:34:43.803 --> 01:34:46.203
who you are and soon
exactly where you're going.

01:34:47.266 --> 01:34:49.933
(intense music)

01:34:55.156 --> 01:34:58.989
So you tell me, does
that sound like a future?

01:35:12.310 --> 01:35:14.600
- [Woman] What are you doing here?

01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:15.983
- I came to my own house.

01:35:18.505 --> 01:35:20.055
To have a drink of my own milk.

01:35:20.985 --> 01:35:23.902
(empty gun clicks)

01:35:33.430 --> 01:35:37.170
Sorry, had too much time to think lately,

01:35:37.170 --> 01:35:38.310
- You look like you just crawled

01:35:38.310 --> 01:35:40.910
out of the toilet and then died.

01:35:40.910 --> 01:35:42.423
- Well something died.

01:35:43.347 --> 01:35:46.080
I think it was finally Vasser.

01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:47.513
- Are you okay?

01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:51.143
- Tired, but alive.

01:35:53.247 --> 01:35:55.197
At least until the hit man has his way.

01:35:57.660 --> 01:36:01.853
- What if maybe I had some
time to think about things too?

01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:04.033
- Seems like it.

01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:10.703
- Why'd you come back?

01:36:11.550 --> 01:36:13.062
- I need to give you something.

01:36:13.062 --> 01:36:14.540
[Gordon Voiceover] I
came armed with an excuse

01:36:14.540 --> 01:36:16.450
for why I was really here.

01:36:16.450 --> 01:36:18.370
Call it a cover-up if you will.

01:36:18.370 --> 01:36:19.383
I have to go.

01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:35.268
- Vasser's in town.

01:36:35.268 --> 01:36:37.600
- He must have a death wish.

01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:39.783
He have pretty good store here.

01:36:40.668 --> 01:36:43.663
Good selection, good value.

01:36:47.950 --> 01:36:50.050
- He came back for money.

01:36:50.050 --> 01:36:51.730
He's got a beard now.

01:36:51.730 --> 01:36:56.090
- A dealer of his came back
to town too, if I find one,

01:36:56.090 --> 01:36:57.620
I'll probably find both.

01:36:57.620 --> 01:36:59.963
This guy got a fortune on his head too,

01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:03.298
today is the hunting season.

01:37:03.298 --> 01:37:06.250
He knows where the money
is and he knows the code.

01:37:06.250 --> 01:37:07.160
- It shouldn't be too hard

01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:08.517
to figure out where he's going.

01:37:08.517 --> 01:37:10.670
- How many places are there?

01:37:10.670 --> 01:37:13.863
He's not trying to hide if
he's following his old trail.

01:37:29.749 --> 01:37:31.130
- [Gordon Voiceover] No doubt about it,

01:37:31.130 --> 01:37:34.720
I was the cheese in the
mousetrap as I stood here.

01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:37.953
Things we're called to do
aren't always pleasant.

01:37:44.190 --> 01:37:46.430
- [Beezy] You always said that
there was something special

01:37:46.430 --> 01:37:48.300
about my birthday.

01:37:48.300 --> 01:37:49.690
Out of all your daughters,

01:37:49.690 --> 01:37:52.360
mine was the only one you ever celebrated.

01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:53.743
How could you forget it?

01:38:11.950 --> 01:38:12.783
- Hey Vasser.

01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:17.973
- I'm Gordon.

01:38:17.973 --> 01:38:18.806
- Wait.

01:38:18.806 --> 01:38:21.100
You Gordon, or Vasser?

01:38:21.100 --> 01:38:24.170
- Well I was Gordon, before I was Vasser.

01:38:24.170 --> 01:38:26.850
- You work for Vasser, or you are Vasser?

01:38:26.850 --> 01:38:30.410
- Well I became Vasser
after working for Vasser.

01:38:30.410 --> 01:38:33.053
- You Gordon and Vasser.

01:38:33.900 --> 01:38:35.690
A lot of people want you dead.

01:38:35.690 --> 01:38:37.420
- Oh I'm sure they do.

01:38:37.420 --> 01:38:41.130
- Must have a good reason
to come back to town.

01:38:41.130 --> 01:38:42.740
Forgot something?

01:38:42.740 --> 01:38:44.130
I did.

01:38:44.130 --> 01:38:47.180
- 400 million dollars maybe?

01:38:47.180 --> 01:38:48.770
- Where'd you hear that?

01:38:48.770 --> 01:38:51.530
- A man with so many targets on your head,

01:38:51.530 --> 01:38:54.800
why didn't you send somebody
else to get the money?

01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:57.060
You've become a ghost for so many years

01:38:57.060 --> 01:38:59.160
just to come back and die here?

01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:02.400
- Who am I gonna trust
with 400 million dollars?

01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:03.233
- Me.

01:39:04.490 --> 01:39:06.620
- I have a place where
the money needs to go.

01:39:06.620 --> 01:39:07.520
- Sorry Vasser.

01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:09.740
Your wife wants you dead.

01:39:09.740 --> 01:39:12.173
She's paying big, so are Tripledaughters.

01:39:16.122 --> 01:39:16.990
(gunshot bangs)

01:39:16.990 --> 01:39:17.920
- You should have waited
until the code worked,

01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:18.920
what if I was wrong?

01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:24.530
You came for me!

01:39:24.530 --> 01:39:26.023
My right-hand man.

01:39:27.250 --> 01:39:30.510
- Sure did Vasser old buddy.

01:39:30.510 --> 01:39:32.033
People really want you dead.

01:39:33.580 --> 01:39:37.240
- Never for a moment did
I ever lose trust in you.

01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:38.550
- [Policeman] You guy's seeing this?

01:39:38.550 --> 01:39:40.400
- It's gunfire at Vasser liquor.

01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:41.320
- You think he's back in town?

01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:43.194
- [Policeman] Sending backup.

01:39:43.194 --> 01:39:45.885
- Have you made up your mind, Vasser?

01:39:45.885 --> 01:39:48.070
Are you dead, disappeared or what?

01:39:50.534 --> 01:39:53.367
(gunfire banging)

01:39:56.630 --> 01:40:00.970
Tell your pal, you sure picked
a shit time to become Vasser,

01:40:00.970 --> 01:40:03.253
or should I say Gordon?

01:40:03.253 --> 01:40:04.120
- What?

01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:05.963
- You can't play me.

01:40:07.311 --> 01:40:09.350
- I'm Vasser.

01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:12.993
- Vasser never would kill
Principal Palone or Spreckin Load.

01:40:13.873 --> 01:40:15.000
- Who?

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:16.523
- The Mesba brothers.

01:40:17.462 --> 01:40:18.480
- Right.

01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:21.390
- They meant nothing to
you, nor did you understand

01:40:21.390 --> 01:40:24.262
the alliance Vasser was about to form.

01:40:24.262 --> 01:40:25.095
(Gordon groans)

01:40:25.095 --> 01:40:28.910
Had Vasser merged with them
first and then killed them,

01:40:28.910 --> 01:40:32.291
I would have had all of Vasser's
stake in the international

01:40:32.291 --> 01:40:36.340
drug and traffic market
when I killed Vasser,

01:40:36.340 --> 01:40:38.710
but then you killed him, and Vasser

01:40:38.710 --> 01:40:41.830
still didn't technically die.

01:40:41.830 --> 01:40:43.293
You never had a clue.

01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:49.600
- No I get it, I wiped out the
world worst sex traffickers.

01:40:51.050 --> 01:40:55.470
Only one I missed was Sizzurp.

01:40:55.470 --> 01:40:58.370
- You would have owned the world

01:40:58.370 --> 01:41:01.190
had you teamed with Mesba brothers.

01:41:01.190 --> 01:41:04.890
400 million dollars, it's
pennies comparatively,

01:41:04.890 --> 01:41:07.640
but it's all you are capable of giving me,

01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:09.823
so it will have to do.

01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:13.030
- Don't bother with the vault.

01:41:13.030 --> 01:41:15.033
- Looks like you found the combination.

01:41:18.050 --> 01:41:19.583
- You're my right-hand man.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:22.073
This isn't like you.

01:41:23.270 --> 01:41:27.620
- Yeah, sure, Gordon,
Vasser's idiot drug-peddling

01:41:27.620 --> 01:41:30.253
assistant and betrayed brother.

01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:33.980
You've been playing me.

01:41:33.980 --> 01:41:37.547
I've been playing you.

01:41:37.547 --> 01:41:40.690
- You never were my right-hand man?

01:41:40.690 --> 01:41:42.610
- Not even close.

01:41:42.610 --> 01:41:46.180
Ever since Vasser decided
the 40% stake for running

01:41:46.180 --> 01:41:50.090
the traffic was too much, he
thought he could get rid of me.

01:41:50.090 --> 01:41:53.050
- [Vasser] Listen I don't know
who took that shot at you,

01:41:53.050 --> 01:41:57.520
but I'm just relieved
to hear you are alive.

01:41:57.520 --> 01:42:01.780
You are right, I did want to
renegotiate our percentages,

01:42:01.780 --> 01:42:04.901
but I would never have gone
about it in such a way.

01:42:04.901 --> 01:42:07.568
(gunshot bangs)

01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:16.400
- So that whole thing about $500 a day?

01:42:20.030 --> 01:42:21.120
- I totally had you!

01:42:26.783 --> 01:42:29.920
- But Vasser did drink
seltzered pickle juice

01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:31.810
with two-inches of sugar on the bottom?

01:42:31.810 --> 01:42:33.690
- Totally made that up!

01:42:33.690 --> 01:42:36.960
- I bet your name isn't even Parasnov.

01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:38.793
- You know actually, it's not.

01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:42.253
- What is it then?

01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:49.170
- What do you know about a guy they call--

01:42:49.170 --> 01:42:50.003
- Sizzurp.

01:42:53.260 --> 01:42:58.260
I wanted to kill Vasser but you
stole that pleasure from me.

01:42:59.123 --> 01:43:02.980
- That 400 million, it's for my daughters.

01:43:02.980 --> 01:43:06.915
- After you left, they're
not your daughters anymore.

01:43:06.915 --> 01:43:09.582
(gunshot bangs)

01:43:26.864 --> 01:43:29.031
- That money is not yours.

01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:31.703
My daughters need that.

01:43:33.742 --> 01:43:35.483
Health insurance.

01:43:36.493 --> 01:43:38.123
STD testing.

01:43:39.590 --> 01:43:40.423
Vitamins.

01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:44.513
Martial arts training.

01:43:51.260 --> 01:43:54.260
(suspenseful music)

01:44:15.445 --> 01:44:19.445
- [Beezy] Look in the
trunk there sexy daughter.

01:44:22.185 --> 01:44:23.018
Okay.

01:44:55.475 --> 01:44:56.558
- It's empty!

01:44:57.595 --> 01:44:59.075
It's empty.

01:44:59.075 --> 01:45:00.654
Who has money?

01:45:00.654 --> 01:45:01.487
Tell me!

01:45:03.403 --> 01:45:04.903
Pretty funny, huh?

01:45:09.443 --> 01:45:11.610
Is your car that blue one?

01:45:14.214 --> 01:45:15.200
[Gordon Voiceover] I
made sure there wasn't

01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:16.943
a dollar in there.

01:45:16.943 --> 01:45:18.273
I wasn't an idiot.

01:45:19.214 --> 01:45:21.043
This was my first stop to town.

01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:36.763
It's too late.

01:45:38.290 --> 01:45:40.653
My daughters already have the money.

01:45:42.290 --> 01:45:46.030
Never did I expect the
fate of all those daughters

01:45:46.030 --> 01:45:48.180
would depend on how good my staff

01:45:48.180 --> 01:45:50.450
did at cleaning under shelves.

01:45:50.450 --> 01:45:53.660
I knew I didn't come all
this way for nothing.

01:45:53.660 --> 01:45:56.820
They say God doesn't call the equipped.

01:45:56.820 --> 01:45:58.830
He equips the called.

01:45:58.830 --> 01:46:01.080
- Those are my daughters now.

01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:03.183
You realize how fast I'll get it back?

01:46:10.472 --> 01:46:12.131
(gunshot bangs)

01:46:12.131 --> 01:46:13.100
- [Gordon Voiceover] Yeah.

01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:14.843
I had to shoot him in the head.

01:46:17.170 --> 01:46:20.189
(emotional music)

01:46:20.189 --> 01:46:23.573
Beezy, sorry I missed so many birthdays.

01:46:27.950 --> 01:46:30.440
Now that you have all of Vasser's money,

01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:32.750
you won't need to have
sex with everyone anymore.

01:46:32.750 --> 01:46:34.950
The only other way you
could accumulate wealth

01:46:34.950 --> 01:46:37.940
like this is if you were
a priest abuse victim.

01:46:37.940 --> 01:46:39.860
I hope you will do everything you imagined

01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:43.559
you said you would do,
because now you have it.

01:46:43.559 --> 01:46:44.392
Gordon.

01:46:45.393 --> 01:46:48.633
Well you leave my daughters
alone, you hear me?

01:46:49.588 --> 01:46:50.588
You hear me?

01:46:52.578 --> 01:46:55.495
(gunshots banging)

01:47:03.030 --> 01:47:05.713
I actually fared pretty
well after those gunshots.

01:47:07.540 --> 01:47:10.239
Well, maybe not.

01:47:10.239 --> 01:47:13.239
(cellphone ringing)

01:47:19.741 --> 01:47:20.574
Hello?

01:47:22.770 --> 01:47:24.940
- [Woman] Is it done?

01:47:24.940 --> 01:47:25.890
- They're all done.

01:47:27.380 --> 01:47:28.230
- [Woman] Vasser?

01:47:29.130 --> 01:47:32.460
- Nope, Vasser died a long time ago.

01:47:32.460 --> 01:47:34.013
- [Woman] Who is this?

01:47:34.013 --> 01:47:35.593
- My name is Gordon.

01:47:37.912 --> 01:47:41.470
You're probably wondering
how or why you got so fat?

01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:44.430
When I was there,

01:47:44.430 --> 01:47:47.823
I switched out that skim
crap you drink for whole.

01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:51.883
I thought it'd be funny.

01:47:54.500 --> 01:47:55.673
Goodbye, wife.

01:47:58.123 --> 01:47:59.710
- Gosh dammit.

01:47:59.710 --> 01:48:01.401
Vasser's back in town?

01:48:01.401 --> 01:48:04.401
He owes me so much in child support!

01:48:40.593 --> 01:48:43.760
(funny video mumbles)

01:49:20.424 --> 01:49:23.174
(dramatic music)

01:49:25.890 --> 01:49:28.290
I like to think I died as Gordon,

01:49:28.290 --> 01:49:32.390
but if I didn't, Vasser
deserved to die twice.

01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:33.773
Once wasn't enough.

01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:42.610
- Don't you dare let him die!

01:49:42.610 --> 01:49:44.320
Until he writes me a check!

01:50:00.116 --> 01:50:03.533
- [Policewoman] Uh, we got Samuel Vasser?

01:50:04.412 --> 01:50:06.392
- [Policeman] That's not Vasser?

01:50:06.392 --> 01:50:07.310
Is it?

01:50:07.310 --> 01:50:09.920
- So you tell me, does
that sound like a future?

01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:12.660
Because the story ends with
you dead from blood loss

01:50:12.660 --> 01:50:15.217
staring face up at a ventilation system.

01:50:24.239 --> 01:50:25.710
- [Policewoman] What is that?

01:50:25.710 --> 01:50:29.043
It's the stupidest damn thing I've seen.

01:50:39.262 --> 01:50:42.012
(dramatic music)

01:52:13.210 --> 01:52:16.080
- Your father's death has been justified.

01:52:16.080 --> 01:52:18.473
We should now pretend he never existed.
