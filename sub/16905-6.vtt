WEBVTT

00:04.852 --> 00:06.653
Liz, there's someone
in the apartment.

00:07.922 --> 00:11.158
<i> Someone who thinks
you're special </i>

00:11.192 --> 00:14.461
<i> in every single way</i>

00:14.495 --> 00:17.948
<i> I wrote this song
to wish you </i>

00:17.982 --> 00:21.802
<i> a happy Valentine's Day</i>

00:21.836 --> 00:23.603
<i> and the chorus goes here</i>

00:23.621 --> 00:24.938
<i> yeah this is where
the chorus goes </i>

00:24.972 --> 00:28.542
Criss, I...

00:28.576 --> 00:30.961
<i> I didn't have time
to write it </i>

00:30.995 --> 00:34.247
<i> but the chorus goes here</i>

00:34.281 --> 00:36.783
<i> Yeah!
This is the chorus </i>

00:36.801 --> 00:38.001
Criss! Criss, it's okay.

00:38.052 --> 00:39.419
I really don't care about
Valentine's.

00:39.454 --> 00:41.288
But you're a lady.

00:41.322 --> 00:42.589
Right?

00:42.623 --> 00:44.791
Why haven't I seen pictures
of you as a baby?

00:44.826 --> 00:46.593
You know what I like
to celebrate on February 14th?

00:46.627 --> 00:49.796
The 1920 founding of
the league of women voters

00:49.831 --> 00:51.064
in Chicago, Illinois.

00:51.098 --> 00:52.732
They were
supposed to meet

00:52.767 --> 00:56.403
on the 13th,
but they all got lost, so...

00:56.437 --> 00:58.021
But Valentine's Day
is fun, Liz.

00:58.072 --> 00:59.322
I wrote you a song,

00:59.357 --> 01:03.109
I found you an awesome clip
on Youtube.

01:03.143 --> 01:04.161
Good morning, everybody.

01:04.194 --> 01:05.311
I'm hanging out with
my friend, John.

01:05.328 --> 01:07.364
Fox 5 morning news starts...
Look over there.

01:07.415 --> 01:10.567
And it starts right now.

01:10.601 --> 01:13.086
Oh, boy.

01:13.120 --> 01:15.789
And that's
just the beginning.

01:15.823 --> 01:17.891
All right, Chros,
all right.

01:17.925 --> 01:19.259
What else do you have planned?

01:19.293 --> 01:20.293
I don't know.

01:20.327 --> 01:21.928
How about dinner
at some place amazing?

01:21.963 --> 01:23.196
You're kidding, right?

01:23.231 --> 01:24.698
It's New York, on Valentine's.

01:24.732 --> 01:25.699
You need a reservation.

01:25.733 --> 01:26.700
All right, so I'll make one.

01:26.734 --> 01:29.669
Right now.

01:29.687 --> 01:31.304
No, it's too late.

01:31.339 --> 01:33.540
Happy
"league of women voters day."

01:33.574 --> 01:35.208
I've got a better idea.

01:35.243 --> 01:36.943
I will make you dinner at home.

01:36.978 --> 01:38.511
Mashed potatoes
in a Martini glass,

01:38.529 --> 01:40.513
we'll open some of that wine
we didn't give the super

01:40.531 --> 01:41.898
for Christmas because you
decided it would come off

01:41.949 --> 01:43.350
as racist.

01:43.384 --> 01:45.869
I'm glad we gave him
those G.E.D. books instead.

01:45.903 --> 01:47.186
We're gonna
use real silverware.

01:47.205 --> 01:48.538
We're gonna light some candles.

01:48.573 --> 01:50.457
We'll play the soundtrack
to <i>Major League.</i>

01:50.491 --> 01:52.726
You're making fun of me,
but that love song is awesome.

01:52.760 --> 01:55.361
All in the comfort
of our own living room.

01:55.379 --> 01:57.330
Look, Criss, you need to know
what you're up against here.

01:57.364 --> 02:00.500
I am 0 for 40
on Valentine's Day.

02:00.534 --> 02:02.168
I will waste you!

02:02.202 --> 02:04.971
You'll have to go through
this old bastard first!

02:05.006 --> 02:09.309
Bon Jovi.

02:09.342 --> 02:11.678
No, no, no, no, no,
Lemon.

02:11.712 --> 02:13.813
Liz,

02:13.848 --> 02:15.682
you know, my mom did just die.

02:15.716 --> 02:19.687
Will you be my Valentine?

02:20.321 --> 02:22.322
I just realized I'm gay.

02:22.356 --> 02:24.224
If this is going
to be "unterrible"

02:24.258 --> 02:25.358
for the first time ever,

02:25.393 --> 02:26.893
I'm not eating off
a coffee table.

02:26.911 --> 02:29.062
Well, you know,
for thousands of years

02:29.080 --> 02:31.164
Japanese diners have used
traditional tatami mats...

02:32.199 --> 02:33.166
Okay, no, no, no.

02:33.200 --> 02:34.233
We'll get a real table.

02:34.252 --> 02:35.869
But we're going
to need one by tonight.

02:35.903 --> 02:37.604
That leaves us
only one option.

02:37.638 --> 02:39.739
We, as a couple,

02:39.774 --> 02:41.708
are going to Ikea.

02:45.596 --> 02:46.579
Were you playing golf?

02:46.597 --> 02:47.747
It's freezing out.

02:47.782 --> 02:49.215
Yes, I was.

02:49.249 --> 02:52.052
In Avery's absence, I have
extra time each day to,

02:52.086 --> 02:53.219
how do I put this?

02:53.254 --> 02:54.454
Release some energy.

02:54.488 --> 02:55.855
Are we talking
about something gross?

02:55.890 --> 02:57.223
My animus has become pent up.

02:57.258 --> 02:58.892
Why don't you just
come out and say

02:58.926 --> 03:00.310
you haven't had

03:00.361 --> 03:02.595
"mommy-daddy
sheet monster times."

03:02.613 --> 03:04.397
I'm not about to cheat
on the woman I love,

03:04.432 --> 03:07.734
and I've never "mommy-daddy
sheet monstered" myself.

03:07.768 --> 03:09.769
Never? Not even during
the <i>Love Boat</i> reunion?

03:11.572 --> 03:12.539
Anyway, sorry you're alone.

03:12.573 --> 03:13.573
I certainly know what it's like

03:13.607 --> 03:16.810
to have
a crummy Valentine's Day.

03:16.844 --> 03:19.412
We're not going to chili's
until I hit one.

03:21.882 --> 03:25.051
Go tell the guy the machine's
not fast enough.

03:26.487 --> 03:29.422
I would kill to get hit in the
crotch by a baseball today.

03:29.457 --> 03:31.725
Not only is my wife
12,000 miles away,

03:31.759 --> 03:34.728
my mother-in-law
has decided to visit.

03:34.762 --> 03:36.062
No. I've never had
a mother-in-law,

03:36.097 --> 03:37.981
but I have seen
<i>Everybody loves Raymond.</i>

03:38.015 --> 03:39.866
"Debra, where's the figurine
I gave you?

03:39.900 --> 03:41.318
Raymond, I gave Debra
a figurine."

03:41.352 --> 03:42.468
"Ma!"

03:42.486 --> 03:44.537
The Jessups are very white
and very proper.

03:44.572 --> 03:47.641
The first Jessup moved
to this country in 1760

03:47.675 --> 03:52.112
to avoid an embarrassing
regifting incident.

03:52.146 --> 03:56.950
But, my lord, I gave you these
dueling pistols last yuletide.

03:56.984 --> 03:57.951
Yes, of course.

03:57.985 --> 04:03.957
Now, if you'll excuse me.

04:06.326 --> 04:08.928
It's been difficult
to get Diana to acknowledge

04:08.963 --> 04:10.864
the reality of what's happened
to her daughter.

04:10.898 --> 04:11.931
What is she,
an Egyptian crocodile?

04:11.966 --> 04:13.933
'Cause she is in "denial."

04:13.968 --> 04:15.185
I've had two coffees.

04:15.219 --> 04:16.970
Anyway,
you'll be happy to hear

04:17.004 --> 04:18.438
that I am giving Valentine's

04:18.471 --> 04:19.805
a second chance this year.

04:19.839 --> 04:21.440
And here we are on six.
For the first...

04:21.475 --> 04:22.609
What a shame.

04:22.643 --> 04:24.878
It felt like we were
just getting started.

04:24.912 --> 04:26.046
"Ma!"

04:28.000 --> 04:34.074

30 ROCK
S06 Ep. 06 - Hey, Baby, What's Wrong

04:43.179 --> 04:46.679
Sync, corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

04:46.734 --> 04:48.752
Hazel, most people think
of Valentine's Day

04:48.803 --> 04:52.055
as a celebration of the burning
of a catholic loudmouth, but

04:52.089 --> 04:53.473
it's also about love.

04:53.507 --> 04:55.809
And escort prices
going way up.

04:55.843 --> 04:58.144
Okay, so, how appropriate
that on Valentine's,

04:58.179 --> 05:01.714
I introduce you to
the new love of your life:

05:01.732 --> 05:05.919
This job, and everyone here.

05:05.953 --> 05:10.890
This is kind of the nerve center of
<i>TGS...</i>, the page desk.

05:10.908 --> 05:12.442
I've had a desk before.

05:12.493 --> 05:14.327
I managed
a haunted house upstate.

05:14.361 --> 05:15.662
But, as you know,

05:15.696 --> 05:18.098
the haunted house industry
is a real boys' club.

05:18.132 --> 05:19.365
Sure, it's hard,

05:19.400 --> 05:21.167
changing careers at my age.

05:21.202 --> 05:22.735
Well, I wouldn't know anything

05:22.753 --> 05:24.254
about being too old
for something.

05:24.288 --> 05:28.041
But here I am, in New York,
living at a 24 hour fitness,

05:28.075 --> 05:30.243
just ready to be inspired.

05:30.261 --> 05:31.344
Hazel, right?

05:31.378 --> 05:32.545
Yeah.

05:32.579 --> 05:34.214
It's so great to have a woman
page here...

05:34.248 --> 05:35.381
Thanks.

05:35.415 --> 05:37.450
To test unapproved Japanese
medications on.

05:37.485 --> 05:39.185
Swallow.

05:39.220 --> 05:41.104
Swallow.

05:41.138 --> 05:42.588
Good girl.

05:42.606 --> 05:44.641
Now, let me know if all
your pubic hair falls out.

05:44.692 --> 05:45.975
Oh, my God!

05:46.026 --> 05:47.560
No, that's what
it's supposed to do.

05:47.595 --> 05:52.632
I want to make sure
it doesn't cause seizures.

05:52.666 --> 05:54.701
Sorry to crash
this sausage party...

05:54.735 --> 05:55.702
Unnecessary.

05:55.736 --> 05:57.270
But I have an emergency.

05:57.288 --> 05:59.706
Sebastian, the producer of
<i>America's kidz got singing,</i>

05:59.740 --> 06:01.775
OD'd last night
in Guy Fieri's apartment.

06:01.809 --> 06:03.376
Oh, my God, that's terrible.

06:03.378 --> 06:03.293
Terrible for me.

06:03.378 --> 06:04.711
Oh, my God, that's terrible.

06:04.745 --> 06:06.813
Tonight's our first live show,
I'm singing,

06:06.847 --> 06:08.815
and we don't have
a line producer.

06:08.849 --> 06:09.799
So I need to borrow Pete.

06:09.834 --> 06:10.967
On Valentine's Day?

06:11.001 --> 06:12.635
No, Pete's got to
go home to his wife.

06:12.670 --> 06:14.721
Actually, Paula didn't want
to do anything for Valentine's,

06:14.755 --> 06:15.922
so she's just going
out to dinner

06:15.956 --> 06:18.457
with her tennis instructor,
mark.

06:18.476 --> 06:21.294
Perfect.
Sound check's at 1:00.

06:21.312 --> 06:23.830
I'm having Sebastian's lucky
earring sent from the morgue.

06:23.864 --> 06:25.148
Wear it.

06:25.182 --> 06:26.800
So you're not spending
tonight with Paul?

06:26.834 --> 06:27.967
No, Paul's been performing on

06:27.985 --> 06:29.903
a transvestite cruise
for the last month.

06:29.937 --> 06:33.472
It's called "Caribbean queens"
for emphasize "No more love on the run".

06:33.491 --> 06:36.025
Billy Ocean is furious,
and very litigious.

06:36.076 --> 06:39.112
But he's powerless as long as they
stay in international waters.

06:39.146 --> 06:40.280
Sure.

06:40.314 --> 06:43.249
Since you asked,
Criss and I are going to Ikea.

06:43.284 --> 06:44.951
For the hate-sex
after your fight?

06:44.985 --> 06:45.952
Good idea.

06:45.986 --> 06:46.953
No, we're not going to fight.

06:46.987 --> 06:48.004
We're getting one thing.

06:48.038 --> 06:49.005
I have a plan...

06:49.039 --> 06:50.323
you're going to fight.

06:50.341 --> 06:51.624
Ikea's where I used
to go pick up

06:51.659 --> 06:53.426
newly-single vulnerable chicks.

06:53.460 --> 06:55.995
I've gotten women there two,
three points hotter than me.

06:56.013 --> 06:59.666
So, you know...fours.

06:59.700 --> 07:01.050
Look, I don't want to go.

07:01.101 --> 07:02.519
But we need a table.

07:02.553 --> 07:04.704
And if Criss thinks he's the guy
to get Liz Lemon on board

07:04.738 --> 07:07.506
with "Saint
lame-entine's nay"...

07:07.525 --> 07:08.842
Honey, that sucks.

07:08.876 --> 07:10.844
We better be able to survive
a simple trip to Ikea.

07:10.878 --> 07:12.579
No, Liz, don't test it.

07:12.613 --> 07:14.864
Especially this early
in a relationship.

07:14.899 --> 07:17.317
It's like when Mickey Rourke
tested his catapult on me.

07:17.351 --> 07:20.720
I was almost listening.

07:20.754 --> 07:21.955
Where are you going?

07:21.989 --> 07:23.723
You never take my advice.

07:23.757 --> 07:25.625
Ms. Maroney.

07:25.659 --> 07:27.877
Thank you, Kenneth.

07:27.912 --> 07:32.498
We'll take a pube count,
but it doesn't feel worth it.

07:32.532 --> 07:35.668
Maybe I'm hitting
them too hard.

07:35.703 --> 07:38.004
And I should not have walked
past that sporting goods store

07:38.038 --> 07:39.906
where the mannequins
have nipples.

07:39.940 --> 07:41.641
And what race were
those mannequins,

07:41.675 --> 07:43.743
because their skin was gray.

07:43.777 --> 07:46.946
They were like
faceless sex aliens.

07:46.981 --> 07:48.514
Jack.

07:48.548 --> 07:51.434
Diana, you're here,
I thought you'd be at the house.

07:51.485 --> 07:53.820
Yes, I dropped my bags off
and shook hands with the baby,

07:53.854 --> 07:57.257
but I wanted to come talk
to you about Avery's situation.

07:57.291 --> 07:59.025
What situation is that?

07:59.059 --> 08:01.160
According to
your Christmas letter,

08:01.195 --> 08:03.196
Avery is in Asia on business.

08:03.230 --> 08:04.998
You know
that she was kidnapped

08:05.032 --> 08:06.933
by the north Korean
secret police.

08:06.967 --> 08:08.268
Don't be vulgar.

08:08.302 --> 08:09.969
As we said in the letter,
she'll be back soon

08:10.004 --> 08:12.105
with some charming
Asian ceramics.

08:12.139 --> 08:15.675
I'm sorry, but who is this
"we" you keep referring to?

08:15.709 --> 08:19.078
Your husband has been dead
for 15 years.

08:19.096 --> 08:21.381
Wonderful news. You know
our pacing horse, <i>squanto?</i>

08:21.415 --> 08:23.583
She's foaling in the spring.

08:23.617 --> 08:24.884
Diana, I know
the Jessups don't like

08:24.918 --> 08:25.885
to talk about
unpleasant matters.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.153
But sometimes I feel like

08:27.187 --> 08:28.972
I'm the only person trying
to get Avery back.

08:29.023 --> 08:33.159
Well, that is what
I wanted to discuss.

08:33.193 --> 08:36.395
It has been months, and I feel
like nothing has happened.

08:36.429 --> 08:37.730
Diana,

08:37.765 --> 08:41.501
extracting an American
from North Korea is a, uh...

08:45.606 --> 08:48.574
Is a lot more difficult
than organizing

08:48.608 --> 08:50.543
a round-Robin paddle
tennis tournament.

08:50.577 --> 08:51.678
What about organizing

08:51.712 --> 08:55.081
three round-Robin paddle
tennis tournaments?

08:55.115 --> 08:56.582
I heard that one
of them was a disaster.

08:56.617 --> 08:58.151
Who told you that?

08:58.185 --> 08:59.152
Bebe Butler?

08:59.186 --> 09:03.423
She's trying
to destroy me.

09:03.457 --> 09:05.992
This situation has
become embarrassing.

09:06.026 --> 09:08.127
One of Frederick's
old Washington friends

09:08.162 --> 09:10.964
has some connections with
the Transylvanian consulate

09:10.998 --> 09:12.098
at the united nations.

09:12.132 --> 09:13.299
I made an appointment
for both of us.

09:13.317 --> 09:14.634
Let me stop you right there.

09:14.668 --> 09:18.137
I've been to the U.N.
repeatedly.

09:18.155 --> 09:21.941
Mein herr,
meine frau Avery Jessup...

09:21.976 --> 09:24.110
Kim Jong-Il
vuvuzela

09:24.144 --> 09:25.244
Charlize Theron...

09:25.279 --> 09:26.679
Boomerang my Sheila back

09:26.714 --> 09:27.914
to her Joey, mate.

09:27.948 --> 09:29.832
And it's gotten me nowhere.

09:29.867 --> 09:31.784
The U.N. is
a useless organization,

09:31.819 --> 09:33.519
with a ridiculous army.

09:33.554 --> 09:35.338
Robin's egg blue helmets?

09:35.372 --> 09:36.556
Great camouflage,

09:36.590 --> 09:38.491
if you're invading
an easter egg hunt.

09:38.525 --> 09:40.426
Jack, perhaps you're
not having success

09:40.461 --> 09:42.261
because of that attitude.

09:42.296 --> 09:44.530
I find you catch
more flies with honey.

09:44.565 --> 09:46.866
First of all,
why do you want flies?

09:46.900 --> 09:50.970
Our appointment is at 11:00.

09:51.005 --> 09:52.805
Strewth, what a bull-dingered

09:52.839 --> 09:55.007
Valentine's Day.

09:55.025 --> 09:56.342
And Jack?

09:56.377 --> 09:58.745
I speak Australian.

10:07.527 --> 10:08.877
Let ferry ride,

10:08.878 --> 10:11.779
was the first time when we've
ever been on a boat together.

10:12.027 --> 10:13.694
Unless you count that time
when the goose chased you

10:13.728 --> 10:15.846
into the Central Park boat pond.

10:15.880 --> 10:17.848
Criss, I need
to ask you something.

10:17.882 --> 10:19.683
Have you ever been to an Ikea?

10:19.718 --> 10:21.552
Do you know what
we're walking into?

10:21.586 --> 10:23.153
You know what?
I like myself.

10:23.187 --> 10:24.705
I have good taste in drapes.

10:24.739 --> 10:27.591
I wish I'd died on Iwo Jima
and never met you.

10:29.027 --> 10:30.227
What was that?

10:30.261 --> 10:31.562
Not us.

10:31.596 --> 10:33.530
We are a good team,
and we have a plan.

10:33.565 --> 10:35.749
We're going to go in, get the
kurtz with the birch veneer,

10:35.800 --> 10:37.034
and then get out.

10:37.052 --> 10:39.570
Then go home and have
an amazing night together.

10:39.604 --> 10:41.055
I just got my period.

10:41.089 --> 10:43.507
Liz, what are
you worried about?

10:43.541 --> 10:45.926
Come on,
this is gonna be fun.

10:45.977 --> 10:48.178
I'm going back
to those cute bowls.

10:48.213 --> 10:52.516
I swear to God,
I will stab you!

10:56.121 --> 10:57.554
So tense.

10:57.589 --> 10:59.857
Just like my mom's back.

11:03.945 --> 11:06.864
Dude, what was that?

11:06.898 --> 11:08.298
I just don't want
to be alone today.

11:08.333 --> 11:10.434
In 48 years, I haven't
had one good Valentine's.

11:10.468 --> 11:11.802
Man, if I weren't
with Lynn now

11:11.836 --> 11:12.970
we could team up.

11:13.004 --> 11:14.738
Valentine's Day
is the perfect time

11:14.773 --> 11:15.939
to meet vulnerable women.

11:15.974 --> 11:17.541
It's scumbag Christmas!

11:17.575 --> 11:19.043
Just tell me what to do.

11:19.077 --> 11:21.245
Look, guys like us have
to pick low-hanging fruit.

11:21.279 --> 11:23.430
We look like <i>Far side</i> drawings.

11:23.465 --> 11:25.749
So we go where women are
sad, desperate, and weak...

11:25.767 --> 11:27.968
Cat shelters, blood banks,
the ice cream stand

11:28.019 --> 11:30.421
at a Celtic woman concert...
And we strike.

11:30.455 --> 11:32.606
Another good place
is the beauty salon,

11:32.640 --> 11:35.142
where white girls try
to do black hair.

11:35.193 --> 11:37.561
Sisters come out crying, feeling
all bad about themselves,

11:37.595 --> 11:39.646
and we walk up on them all,

11:39.697 --> 11:42.099
"Hey, baby,
what's wrong?"

11:42.117 --> 11:44.802
You're married,
I actually have a girlfriend,

11:44.836 --> 11:46.770
all our dirtbag knowledge
is going to go to waste.

11:46.788 --> 11:47.988
No, it's not.

11:48.039 --> 11:51.241
Lutz, prepare for
the adventure of a lifetime.

11:51.276 --> 11:53.944
Then after we watch
<i>Fievel goes west,</i>

11:53.962 --> 11:57.448
we're gonna get you some action.

11:57.482 --> 11:59.800
Hey, you needed to see me?

11:59.834 --> 12:02.152
Did you book a female
hair-person for me tonight?

12:02.187 --> 12:03.804
Who's Karen?

12:03.838 --> 12:06.824
I need someone named Trentence,
or Orbino.

12:06.858 --> 12:09.059
Get in the game, Pete.
Your star is freaking out.

12:09.094 --> 12:10.060
What are you freaking
out about?

12:10.095 --> 12:11.662
You sing live all the time.

12:11.696 --> 12:13.847
This is different.

12:13.898 --> 12:15.649
It's not some rinky-dink
late night show

12:15.683 --> 12:17.101
that a bald idiot produces.

12:17.135 --> 12:20.270
It's the largest audience
I've ever performed for.

12:20.304 --> 12:23.273
And after spending all season
ripping cute kids new ones,

12:23.308 --> 12:24.942
everyone wants me to fail.

12:24.976 --> 12:27.277
Tomorrow night on
<i>America's kidz got singing,</i>

12:27.312 --> 12:30.681
the judge becomes
the opposite of the judge.

12:30.715 --> 12:32.449
Come on, guys,
a little effort.

12:32.484 --> 12:34.251
Jenna Maroney's singing live,

12:34.285 --> 12:37.054
and all of America is just
waiting for that

12:37.088 --> 12:40.791
To get  over and over
and over again with a.

12:40.825 --> 12:42.559
Nice bleeping.
Sorry about earlier.

12:42.594 --> 12:44.528
Jenna, you need to relax.

12:44.562 --> 12:46.847
Listen up, if tonight isn't
a huge "jiumph,"

12:46.881 --> 12:48.098
which is short for
"Jenna triumph,"

12:48.133 --> 12:49.099
it's on you.

12:49.134 --> 12:50.384
And like all celebrities,

12:50.435 --> 12:52.870
I'm very good
at shifting the blame.

12:52.904 --> 12:55.439
I attacked Nancy Kerrigan.

12:58.443 --> 13:00.677
- Did you get my message?
- Yes, your excellency.

13:00.695 --> 13:02.212
And I also wish you,

13:02.247 --> 13:06.733
a "bear-y" happy
Valentine's Day.

13:06.784 --> 13:08.852
He said it'll be another hour.

13:08.870 --> 13:12.206
The assistant attache has
a few minutes around 14:30.

13:12.240 --> 13:16.226
14:30? You do know that this
office is in America, right?

13:16.261 --> 13:17.561
Do you see a 14
on my watch?

13:17.595 --> 13:19.129
Yes, it's the date.

13:19.164 --> 13:20.330
Happy Valentine's Day.

13:20.365 --> 13:21.532
That's cute.

13:21.566 --> 13:23.333
And what insolvent country
do you come from?

13:23.368 --> 13:25.402
New Jersey.
I'm just a weirdo.

13:25.436 --> 13:27.004
Will you please
stop being so hostile?

13:27.038 --> 13:28.972
You just make everything worse.

13:29.007 --> 13:31.091
No wonder you haven't
accomplished anything.

13:31.142 --> 13:33.143
You know what?
Avery loved a good fight.

13:33.178 --> 13:35.429
She used to call the cable
company and dispute our bill,

13:35.480 --> 13:36.747
just for the sport of it.

13:36.781 --> 13:39.750
She wouldn't stand for
this dog and pony show.

13:39.784 --> 13:41.718
I have organized several
dog and pony shows,

13:41.753 --> 13:43.120
and I'm offended
by what you're implying.

13:43.154 --> 13:45.189
How are you Avery's mother?

13:45.223 --> 13:47.424
We have a few things
in common, Jack.

13:47.458 --> 13:49.927
We both married much,
much older men,

13:49.961 --> 13:51.328
which can be hard,

13:51.362 --> 13:53.730
or, more often, flaccid.

13:53.765 --> 13:55.132
I have an idea. Maybe,
we just don't talk at all.

13:55.166 --> 13:58.101
Maybe we sit quietly
and read our,

13:58.136 --> 14:01.705
soccer magazine.

14:03.141 --> 14:06.176
Mr. Jordan's lizard, Jeremy,

14:06.211 --> 14:09.096
is always escaping
and biting everyone.

14:09.130 --> 14:10.614
Like owner, like lizard.

14:10.648 --> 14:12.115
Oh, man.

14:12.150 --> 14:15.485
That's why Mr. Jordan got him
a GPS collar.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.421
Now it's easier to find...

14:17.455 --> 14:19.756
Well that can't be.

14:19.774 --> 14:21.424
It says he's inside the room.

14:21.442 --> 14:23.310
Maybe you're reading it wrong?

14:23.361 --> 14:26.730
Three feet, two feet,

14:26.764 --> 14:32.069
it says he's right on top of us.

14:33.288 --> 14:34.938
Oh, my God, my face.

14:36.457 --> 14:38.792
He's mating with my mouth.

14:38.826 --> 14:42.246
He likes you!

14:42.280 --> 14:43.347
Here's a good one.

14:43.381 --> 14:45.315
Go to a strip club
on Father's Day,

14:45.350 --> 14:46.683
and shout things like,

14:46.718 --> 14:48.669
"I'm proud of you!"

14:48.720 --> 14:49.670
Classic.

14:49.721 --> 14:51.121
Where's Pete?

14:51.139 --> 14:53.924
I just dyed my gums because I
want them to pop on camera.

14:53.958 --> 14:54.975
But now they're burning.

14:55.009 --> 14:56.293
Another way
to meet damaged women

14:56.327 --> 14:57.344
is to hang out with actresses.

14:57.395 --> 14:58.345
Actresses?

14:58.396 --> 14:59.896
Where? How young are they?

14:59.931 --> 15:01.481
I'll do nudity.

15:01.516 --> 15:02.933
Back in the day,
used to work as a stock boy

15:02.967 --> 15:04.735
in a chic uptown
department store,

15:04.769 --> 15:06.970
called "Ray-Ray's discount
clothes bucket."

15:07.005 --> 15:08.689
I would go to
the swimsuit section

15:08.740 --> 15:10.324
and switch the tags.

15:10.358 --> 15:13.443
I'd take a size six and put
a size twelve sticker on it.

15:13.477 --> 15:15.912
And then some thick girl
would try to squeeze into it,

15:15.947 --> 15:17.381
and come out of
the dressing room like,

15:17.415 --> 15:20.417
"I've gotten bigger.
Why do I even bother dieting?"

15:20.451 --> 15:21.518
And I'm all like,

15:21.552 --> 15:23.653
"Hey, baby, what's wrong?"

15:23.671 --> 15:27.124
You know, a great place to meet
vulnerable women is weight watchers.

15:27.158 --> 15:29.209
I did "watchers"
to stay pageant-fit,

15:29.260 --> 15:31.428
but it was too much math
for a six-year-old.

15:31.462 --> 15:32.679
Thank God I found cigarettes.

15:32.714 --> 15:35.499
"Weight watchers," got it.

15:35.533 --> 15:37.384
And if worse comes to worse,

15:37.435 --> 15:38.769
make the lady feel vulnerable.

15:38.803 --> 15:42.005
Check this out.

15:45.543 --> 15:47.344
Baby, did someone
throw cereal on you?

15:47.362 --> 15:48.845
Let's get you out
of these wet clothes.

15:48.863 --> 15:52.682
What is wrong
with you people?

15:52.700 --> 15:54.284
Whatever.

15:54.319 --> 15:56.236
Jeremy says she's
a tease anyway.

15:56.287 --> 15:59.289
Now, let's hit
weight watchers.

15:59.324 --> 16:00.857
How is there
no signal in here?

16:00.875 --> 16:02.209
Silence, prisoner.

16:02.243 --> 16:04.061
I mean, can I help you,
valued customer?

16:04.095 --> 16:06.330
There you are.

16:06.364 --> 16:07.331
What are you doing?

16:07.365 --> 16:08.332
Buying stuff for tonight,

16:08.366 --> 16:09.366
to make it awesome.

16:09.384 --> 16:11.201
Look, salt and pepper shakers.

16:11.219 --> 16:13.637
You put them together,
it makes a heart.

16:13.671 --> 16:16.440
Take them apart,
two red sperms.

16:16.474 --> 16:17.541
We're not getting that.

16:17.575 --> 16:19.209
What's with
the "neggy" vibes, jeez.

16:19.227 --> 16:20.260
I can get things.

16:20.311 --> 16:21.378
Not if you're
not paying for them.

16:25.983 --> 16:28.785
Let's go get that table,
buddy.

16:32.740 --> 16:34.741
Ikea.

16:43.278 --> 16:44.562
First things first.

16:44.580 --> 16:45.730
I am from Transylvania,

16:45.764 --> 16:47.231
but I am not a vampire.

16:47.266 --> 16:50.118
I'm just a night owl with
a terrible garlic allergy.

16:50.169 --> 16:52.937
So, this is regarding that boy

16:52.971 --> 16:54.705
who went missing in my castle?

16:54.740 --> 16:56.124
No, we're here about my wife.

16:56.175 --> 16:59.710
My daughter, Avery Jessup,
she's in North Korea.

16:59.745 --> 17:02.716
Yes, the Jessup case.

17:04.849 --> 17:08.319
Yes, I would like to speak
to Kim Jong-Un, immediately.

17:08.353 --> 17:09.921
That is unacceptable.

17:09.954 --> 17:12.857
I understand.

17:12.891 --> 17:15.443
The operator wouldn't let
me dial long-distance.

17:15.477 --> 17:16.444
So, thank you both for coming.

17:16.478 --> 17:17.595
No.

17:17.613 --> 17:21.265
That is exactly what
I expected would happen.

17:21.282 --> 17:22.599
Does that hurt?

17:22.634 --> 17:24.569
Well, I'm so sorry.

17:24.603 --> 17:28.372
Well that is just
the beginning, you...penis!

17:28.406 --> 17:30.842
This isn't some
idiotic civil war

17:30.876 --> 17:32.610
in some country without oil.

17:32.644 --> 17:36.180
This is my favorite daughter.

17:36.215 --> 17:39.634
And she is a beautiful
white American.

17:39.668 --> 17:41.586
So why the fudge isn't

17:41.620 --> 17:44.922
everyone fudging freaking
the fudge out!

17:44.957 --> 17:45.923
She's right.

17:45.958 --> 17:46.991
You are a penis!

17:47.025 --> 17:49.227
I'm going to call security.

17:49.261 --> 17:52.864
One of the guys has a whistle.

17:52.898 --> 17:53.865
Vampire push.

17:53.899 --> 17:55.600
Did you just threaten her?

17:55.634 --> 17:58.102
I want you to apologize
to this woman, right now.

17:58.137 --> 17:59.470
I am a very powerful man.

17:59.505 --> 18:00.822
I can see to it
that Transylvania

18:00.856 --> 18:03.141
never sees another
episode of <i>Friends.</i>

18:03.175 --> 18:05.710
No! Monica and Chandler just
slept together in London.

18:05.744 --> 18:07.645
I'm... I'm sorry.

18:07.679 --> 18:09.514
Okay. Now admit
the U.N. is useless.

18:09.548 --> 18:11.949
It is. Half the building
is a laser tag arena.

18:11.984 --> 18:14.485
Admit it's annoying
when Bono comes around.

18:14.520 --> 18:15.953
It's the worst.

18:15.988 --> 18:18.556
Every time he says he's not
hungry when we collect money

18:18.590 --> 18:20.625
for pizza, and then
he eats, like, three slices.

18:20.659 --> 18:22.560
You disgust me.

18:22.594 --> 18:24.662
Come on, let's go.

18:24.696 --> 18:26.197
And, Cjokula,

18:26.231 --> 18:28.499
at Monica and Chandler's
wedding,

18:28.534 --> 18:30.134
Rachel's the one
who is pregnant.

18:33.555 --> 18:36.891
Finally, tables.

18:36.942 --> 18:39.527
Stop walking so close to me!

18:39.561 --> 18:40.912
I'm sorry.

18:40.946 --> 18:42.513
It's this place.

18:42.548 --> 18:44.482
But also, if you would
just let me get a few steps

18:44.516 --> 18:47.735
ahead of you first,
and then you walk?

18:47.786 --> 18:49.871
I found it.

18:49.905 --> 18:50.988
Nice.

18:51.023 --> 18:51.989
What?

18:52.024 --> 18:53.824
It's nice, it's just...

18:53.858 --> 18:58.379
I don't know if I'm feeling it,
you know?

18:58.413 --> 19:00.031
What about this idea?

19:00.065 --> 19:01.415
I know a guy who cuts glass...

19:01.466 --> 19:02.466
No. I took measurements,

19:02.501 --> 19:04.368
I looked at colors,
we came here.

19:04.386 --> 19:05.403
This is the plan.

19:05.437 --> 19:07.371
Yeah, it's just
that this table,

19:07.389 --> 19:09.173
it feels kind of uptight.

19:09.207 --> 19:10.675
And I think something
a little more fun

19:10.709 --> 19:12.343
would be a better table,
for me.

19:12.377 --> 19:13.711
Well,
I don't know, Criss.

19:13.729 --> 19:15.680
Maybe a more fun table
wouldn't be as supportive.

19:16.815 --> 19:18.015
What? No, no,
we are not doing this.

19:18.050 --> 19:19.267
We are not letting this table

19:19.318 --> 19:20.818
be a metaphor
for our relationship.

19:20.852 --> 19:22.737
That's what Ikea wants us to do.

19:22.771 --> 19:24.855
I'm just not sure my chair
wants to be with this table.

19:24.889 --> 19:26.741
Why, because
deep down your chair

19:26.775 --> 19:28.092
would rather be
with other chairs?

19:28.126 --> 19:29.393
I think the table

19:29.428 --> 19:30.828
needs to stop listening
to its mother.

19:30.862 --> 19:32.747
Well, it's just
the table thinks the chair

19:32.781 --> 19:37.234
takes too many camping trips
with Richard.

19:37.252 --> 19:39.287
Almost there, teammate.

19:39.338 --> 19:41.905
To the warehouse!

19:41.924 --> 19:47.244
Seriously? 
"Zoo York."

19:47.262 --> 19:50.598
Okay, everybody,
sound check for Ms. Maroney.

19:50.632 --> 19:52.617
No, I don't want
a live band.

19:52.651 --> 19:53.784
Live bands make mistakes.

19:53.819 --> 19:56.887
Pete, I have
made love to Alfonso,

19:56.922 --> 19:58.589
he can't keep rhythm,
get him out of here.

19:58.607 --> 19:59.991
That's a wrap on Alfonso.

20:00.025 --> 20:05.930
Alfonso Disparioso, everybody.

20:05.964 --> 20:07.732
This is your moment.

20:07.766 --> 20:09.634
The world breathes for you.

20:09.668 --> 20:11.101
I love you, myself.

20:11.119 --> 20:13.321
And playback.

20:23.382 --> 20:24.949
Jenna, you're not singing.

20:24.983 --> 20:27.251
Yes, I am.

20:36.461 --> 20:39.129
I'm sorry I was such
an Italian in there,

20:39.147 --> 20:41.232
but that was unacceptable.

20:41.266 --> 20:42.683
No, you were wonderful.

20:42.734 --> 20:45.236
The way your eyes went dead,
just like Avery's.

20:45.270 --> 20:46.437
I didn't know you
had that in you.

20:46.471 --> 20:49.073
"Yosemite Sam" was based
on my grandfather,

20:49.107 --> 20:50.841
so yes, I do have a temper.

20:50.876 --> 20:53.044
There are a lot of things
you don't know about me, Jack.

20:53.078 --> 20:56.647
In 1978, I was in <i>Playboy,</i>
just wearing a necktie

20:56.665 --> 20:58.449
and holding hands
with a black girl.

20:58.483 --> 21:00.751
How could I have ever said

21:00.786 --> 21:02.953
that you're not
your daughter's mother.

21:02.988 --> 21:06.490
Those incredible cheekbones,
like an evil Disney queen.

21:06.525 --> 21:08.659
No, I misjudged you.

21:08.694 --> 21:10.695
The way you broke
that man down

21:10.729 --> 21:13.798
like a folding table
at a dog and pony show.

21:13.832 --> 21:17.034
And I am sorry I compared you
to my late husband.

21:17.069 --> 21:20.187
You are not some
liver-spotted old man

21:20.222 --> 21:22.239
constantly spilling hot tea
in his lap

21:22.274 --> 21:24.575
until his whole crotch
was useless.

21:24.609 --> 21:25.559
Useless!

21:25.610 --> 21:27.177
You are young.

21:27.195 --> 21:28.946
You are virile.

21:28.980 --> 21:31.082
Your hair, like a lion's mane.

21:31.116 --> 21:36.353
My eyes,
like two pools of ice water.

21:36.371 --> 21:38.022
Let's keep walking,

21:38.056 --> 21:39.023
in the cold.

21:39.057 --> 21:40.357
Yes.

21:40.375 --> 21:42.410
Do you like baseball?
Let's talk about baseball.

21:42.461 --> 21:44.412
I love baseball.
Abner Doubleday.

21:44.463 --> 21:46.630
- The bats are long and hard.
- The gloves are girls.

21:46.665 --> 21:48.749
- Balls!
- Jeter's thighs in those pants.

21:48.800 --> 21:50.134
New topic.

21:57.065 --> 21:58.448
You know, it's funny.

21:58.466 --> 21:59.916
If those teeth were
in your vagina,

21:59.951 --> 22:02.352
you'd be considered a monster.

22:02.386 --> 22:04.471
Well, Jenna, there's nothing
physically wrong with you.

22:04.505 --> 22:06.139
That's impossible.

22:06.174 --> 22:07.140
Why can't I sing?

22:07.175 --> 22:08.992
Well, it must be
psychosomatic.

22:09.026 --> 22:11.794
Don't worry, that's just
a fancy doctor word

22:11.813 --> 22:13.129
for "your brain is broken."

22:13.147 --> 22:15.232
Unfortunately, there's
no field of medicine

22:15.266 --> 22:16.700
that deals with the brain.

22:16.734 --> 22:20.821
But, I can give you
a pamphlet for a cult.

22:20.855 --> 22:21.838
You don't understand.

22:21.873 --> 22:23.156
This is how
I make my living.

22:23.191 --> 22:24.658
Like me and my cell phone
bedazzling.

22:24.692 --> 22:26.276
I have to be able to sing.

22:26.310 --> 22:28.161
Maybe you're shutting down
because of all the pressure.

22:28.196 --> 22:29.863
There is a lot riding
on this performance.

22:29.914 --> 22:33.550
Pressure? That's ridiculous.

22:33.584 --> 22:36.486
Pressure is trying
to pass for four

22:36.504 --> 22:38.054
when you just turned seven,

22:38.089 --> 22:40.156
at the "Miss Toddler
Panama city" pageant.

22:40.174 --> 22:42.626
You're crammed into
the same five-inch heels

22:42.660 --> 22:45.512
you wore the year before,
blood pooling in your toes.

22:45.546 --> 22:46.796
But you know if you don't win,

22:46.830 --> 22:49.232
mom can't fix the hole
in the gator fence,

22:49.267 --> 22:50.467
so you'll be up all night,

22:50.501 --> 22:52.519
stabbing gators.

22:52.553 --> 22:54.721
Pressure is performing
on a party boat

22:54.772 --> 22:56.172
that catches on fire,

22:56.190 --> 22:57.974
your throat burning
from the smoke.

22:58.009 --> 23:02.445
You still sing so beautifully
that it calms the passengers,

23:02.480 --> 23:04.698
so that you
and the crew can escape.

23:04.732 --> 23:06.015
Pressure...

23:06.033 --> 23:07.067
It's the "Rule of threes,"
Pete.

23:07.118 --> 23:09.052
Is singing the Yemeni national
anthem

23:09.086 --> 23:11.738
while a handsome but ruthless
general pushes a scimitar

23:11.789 --> 23:13.039
into your neck,

23:13.074 --> 23:14.858
Kristin Chenoweth's
corpse at your feet.

23:14.892 --> 23:16.960
That's pressure.

23:16.994 --> 23:18.712
This live show is nothing.

23:18.746 --> 23:21.131
Well, there's something
weird going on here.

23:21.165 --> 23:23.366
You feel that
sexual energy too?

23:23.384 --> 23:26.836
I mean, but... it would
be wrong to act on it.

23:29.757 --> 23:33.710
Well, it's 5:00 somewhere.

23:44.205 --> 23:47.641
No, this isn't happening.
They're sold out.

23:47.675 --> 23:49.226
This is why you don't
just choose one option.

23:49.260 --> 23:50.911
We were in a room full
of tables.

23:50.945 --> 23:53.413
No, this is why you
don't waste 45 minutes

23:53.448 --> 23:56.767
wandering around the
"Valentine's marketplace."

23:56.818 --> 23:58.568
Trying to find stuff
for tonight.

23:58.603 --> 24:00.720
For you.
Really cool stuff.

24:00.755 --> 24:02.756
You still have those salt
and pepper shakers, don't you?

24:02.790 --> 24:05.492
Well, I don't
want them anymore.

24:05.526 --> 24:07.027
'Cause I'm not
feeling romantic.

24:07.061 --> 24:10.464
God, you actually got
me excited about today.

24:10.498 --> 24:12.232
Valentine's is the worst!

24:12.250 --> 24:14.801
It's even worse
than earth day.

24:14.836 --> 24:17.070
You just see so many
dirty feet in sandals.

24:17.105 --> 24:18.071
I don't know, Liz.

24:18.106 --> 24:19.623
This could have been special.

24:19.674 --> 24:20.740
I had stuff planned.

24:20.775 --> 24:22.109
No, you didn't.

24:22.143 --> 24:24.244
You wrote half a song,
and thought you'd "wing it,"

24:24.262 --> 24:25.479
like you do with everything.

24:25.513 --> 24:26.646
I mean, if you'd had a plan

24:26.681 --> 24:27.914
we wouldn't even be
in this hellhole.

24:27.949 --> 24:31.502
Good, go wide with it.
Go.

24:32.136 --> 24:33.353
Really?

24:33.387 --> 24:35.789
Well, how's your super-planned
life going, Liz?

24:35.823 --> 24:36.890
You're 40-something...

24:36.924 --> 24:38.558
One! Come on, Criss.

24:38.592 --> 24:39.776
You have no kids.

24:39.811 --> 24:40.777
The only thing you
like about your job

24:40.812 --> 24:42.429
is taking home free sodas.

24:42.463 --> 24:44.898
And you're attacking
the only good thing in your life

24:44.932 --> 24:46.116
because of a stupid table.

24:46.150 --> 24:47.567
This isn't about the table.

24:47.601 --> 24:50.403
This is about you never
following through on anything,

24:50.438 --> 24:51.671
ever.

24:51.706 --> 24:53.306
It's why you didn't
finish law school,

24:53.341 --> 24:56.910
it's why you still aren't done
filling out your 2010 census.

24:56.944 --> 24:58.478
Well what race am
I supposed to check?

24:58.513 --> 24:59.779
We all come from Africa.

24:59.814 --> 25:00.780
You know what?

25:00.815 --> 25:02.415
Ikea tested us, we failed.

25:02.450 --> 25:03.416
Okay, just go.

25:03.451 --> 25:05.085
That's a good idea.

25:06.120 --> 25:07.554
We're done here.

25:07.588 --> 25:10.140
Yeah, we are definitely done.

25:10.174 --> 25:11.625
Thank you.

25:11.659 --> 25:14.094
That's why I get out of
the <i>nidurgangur</i> in the morning.

25:14.128 --> 25:17.147
It's one of our cheaper beds.

25:30.811 --> 25:32.696
There you are.

25:32.747 --> 25:35.215
I think your break is over,
Ms. Wassername.

25:35.249 --> 25:38.451
Did I make a mistake,
Kenneth?

25:38.486 --> 25:40.120
A big mistake.

25:40.154 --> 25:42.172
Tracy Jordan threw milk at you,

25:42.206 --> 25:45.692
and you didn't even thank him?

25:45.726 --> 25:47.027
How does that reflect
on the page program?

25:47.061 --> 25:49.596
And our mascot, "Pagey,"
a piece of paper.

25:49.630 --> 25:51.364
Everyone here is awful.

25:51.399 --> 25:54.267
I need to be inspired.

25:54.302 --> 25:56.770
I came here to start
a glamorous new life.

25:56.804 --> 25:59.839
'Cause today,
anyone can be famous.

25:59.874 --> 26:02.275
I mean, look at foxy knoxy.

26:02.310 --> 26:05.545
What did she ever do
besides not kill anybody?

26:05.580 --> 26:07.547
So, why not me?

26:07.582 --> 26:08.949
I could have a fragrance,

26:08.983 --> 26:11.051
or a line
of children's handbags,

26:11.085 --> 26:14.321
or be in a reality show with
other kooky dumb sluts.

26:14.355 --> 26:16.540
You don't think
I have dreams?

26:16.574 --> 26:20.727
Last night, I dreamed
a baby ate my hair.

26:20.761 --> 26:24.664
But sometimes, you have
to start at the bottom.

26:24.699 --> 26:26.900
I'd like for you to make
a delivery for me.

26:26.934 --> 26:28.368
And, while you're out,

26:28.402 --> 26:30.770
think about
how your page underwear

26:30.805 --> 26:33.340
has been handed down,
page to page,

26:33.374 --> 26:35.609
for over 70 years.

26:46.621 --> 26:50.290
- So, do you like music?
- Yes.

26:50.324 --> 26:53.693
I have supported the Baltimore
Philharmonic for years.

26:53.727 --> 26:57.197
These days, it's just a boom box
and a guy in a crab costume.

26:57.231 --> 26:59.399
He gets shot out of
a Cannon at Ravens Games.

26:59.433 --> 27:01.284
The city may not be thriving.

27:01.335 --> 27:02.869
Well, it's not
just Baltimore.

27:02.903 --> 27:04.904
We live in a benighted age.

27:04.939 --> 27:06.923
The last time I heard
classical music on television

27:06.958 --> 27:10.043
was Schubert's final sonata
in a commercial.

27:10.077 --> 27:12.879
Now why would anyone
use music written by a man

27:12.913 --> 27:14.714
dying of syphilis
to sell douches.

27:14.748 --> 27:17.934
Because people
are getting stupider.

27:17.969 --> 27:19.636
Think how much
Schubert accomplished

27:19.687 --> 27:21.587
in the 31 years he was alive.

27:21.606 --> 27:22.588
Coming through.

27:22.607 --> 27:25.192
And then there's,

27:25.726 --> 27:26.810
this guy.

27:26.861 --> 27:30.463
My taxes are paying
for your healthcare!

27:30.498 --> 27:32.115
Do a sit-up!

27:32.149 --> 27:37.103
I really
underestimated you, Jack.

27:40.107 --> 27:42.275
Maybe we shouldn't
talk at all.

27:52.548 --> 27:55.884
How do you think
our boys are doing in there?

27:56.418 --> 27:58.253
I guess it's been
a pretty rough week.

27:58.287 --> 28:01.356
Yesterday, I ate all the cheese
out of the mouse traps.

28:01.390 --> 28:06.828
Now, who'd like to continue
this magic over drinks?

28:08.397 --> 28:12.117
A Cosmo's five points?

28:12.151 --> 28:13.985
Okay.

28:14.036 --> 28:15.303
All right.

28:18.974 --> 28:20.875
Hey, baby, what's wrong?

28:20.910 --> 28:22.641
Nothing's wrong, you think
something's wrong with me?

28:22.642 --> 28:23.378
What's wrong with you?

28:23.412 --> 28:25.680
Um, didn't the white lady
just mess up your hair?

28:25.714 --> 28:28.383
I work for the post office,
I was delivering a package.

28:28.417 --> 28:29.584
But you think
my hair's messed up?

28:29.618 --> 28:30.835
No, I...

28:30.886 --> 28:32.003
You're gonna tell me
about black lady hair,

28:32.054 --> 28:33.521
you "Louie Anderson"
little bitch?

28:33.556 --> 28:35.340
Run! Run for your life!

28:45.568 --> 28:46.901
Hi.

28:46.936 --> 28:47.986
Are you shopping for someone?

28:49.138 --> 28:50.505
Do you know what size she is?

28:50.539 --> 28:52.474
No. I don't know. Maybe. No.

28:52.508 --> 28:54.909
I see.

28:54.944 --> 28:56.211
It's okay.

28:56.245 --> 29:00.315
I have an Uncle who uses
my discount here all the time.

29:02.835 --> 29:05.453
I'll take it.

29:10.659 --> 29:11.659
Okay, Jenna.

29:11.677 --> 29:14.179
I think I know what
your problem is.

29:14.213 --> 29:15.196
It's the "yips."

29:15.231 --> 29:16.364
When will congress
pass a law

29:16.398 --> 29:18.216
to get those bastards
out of our country?

29:18.267 --> 29:19.601
No, no. The "yips"
is something

29:19.635 --> 29:20.702
that happens to athletes.

29:20.736 --> 29:22.003
They get in their heads,

29:22.021 --> 29:23.504
and stop being able
to do stuff

29:23.522 --> 29:24.973
they've done a million times.

29:25.007 --> 29:27.509
Like, bet me during a poker
game at Tony Romo's house?

29:27.543 --> 29:30.228
I know you don't think it's
mental, but it is.

29:30.279 --> 29:31.646
And, I get it.

29:31.680 --> 29:33.848
- It's scary to admit...
- How would you know?

29:33.866 --> 29:35.033
Because it happened to me!

29:35.067 --> 29:38.069
I was the best they'd
ever seen, and I blew it!

29:42.458 --> 29:45.960
Peter Hornberger, a shoo-in
for this Olympic squad,

29:45.995 --> 29:47.529
about to arch.

29:47.563 --> 29:48.546
You're going to want
to watch this, folks,

29:48.581 --> 29:50.665
so put down your Rubik's cube,

29:50.699 --> 29:53.368
turn off that Yakov Smirnoff
standup tape,

29:53.402 --> 29:56.638
and set all your
swatches to right now.

29:56.672 --> 29:57.872
I've been shot!

29:57.890 --> 30:01.392
Someone run into town
and find a payphone!

30:01.427 --> 30:04.345
This happened to you?
We have something in common?

30:05.514 --> 30:07.849
Look, tonight is huge
for you, and for me.

30:07.883 --> 30:09.651
If this goes well,
it could get us both out

30:09.685 --> 30:10.735
of the late-night ghetto.

30:10.769 --> 30:12.186
Because you and me?

30:12.221 --> 30:13.220
We're prime-time, baby.

30:13.239 --> 30:14.939
Fine, it's mental.

30:14.990 --> 30:16.223
I have the "yips."

30:16.242 --> 30:17.725
What am I supposed to do?

30:17.743 --> 30:19.527
Okay, we don't have
a lot of time.

30:19.561 --> 30:22.063
So, maybe just by acknowledging
the problem,

30:22.097 --> 30:24.432
we fixed it?

30:24.466 --> 30:25.767
I think we did.

30:25.801 --> 30:27.619
I'm cured!

30:36.912 --> 30:37.979
It's worse.

30:38.013 --> 30:39.981
I can't open my mouth.

30:46.254 --> 30:49.457
Happy
Valentine's to the two lovers.

30:49.491 --> 30:51.960
Come into my restaurant
for the romance.

30:51.994 --> 30:54.329
No, no, no,
we're not together.

30:54.363 --> 30:55.863
What?

30:55.898 --> 30:57.448
But, this is a crime.

30:57.483 --> 31:00.401
Such a beautiful,
age-appropriate couple.

31:00.436 --> 31:01.653
You are perfect together.

31:01.704 --> 31:03.805
You are like pasta,
and a mouth.

31:03.839 --> 31:05.990
Do you not think that
she's beautiful?

31:06.041 --> 31:07.992
Yes, empirically
she is attractive.

31:08.043 --> 31:11.112
And is he not handsome,
with hair like black vermicelli?

31:11.130 --> 31:13.748
Yes, he is handsome,
but...

31:13.782 --> 31:16.918
The only "but" we speak
of tonight,

31:16.952 --> 31:19.470
is the butt of the human ass.

31:19.505 --> 31:22.156
Valentine's,
she is a celebration

31:22.191 --> 31:24.659
of love, and sex,

31:24.693 --> 31:27.462
and touch.

31:27.896 --> 31:29.564
Come inside,

31:29.598 --> 31:33.434
and have the most romantic
<i>notte</i> of your lives.

31:33.468 --> 31:35.469
We have a unisex bathroom,

31:35.487 --> 31:36.988
with, <i>come si dice,</i>

31:37.022 --> 31:40.141
no lock,
and extra mirrors.

31:43.946 --> 31:45.029
I have to go check on Liddy.

31:45.080 --> 31:47.749
I have to go walk
around the park.

31:47.783 --> 31:51.452
Maybe forever.

31:56.425 --> 32:00.628
Darn it,
what am I doing wrong?

32:00.662 --> 32:01.829
This is it, Lutz.

32:01.847 --> 32:02.930
The Ikea parking lot.

32:02.965 --> 32:04.932
If you can't close
the deal here,

32:04.967 --> 32:06.067
you're on your own.

32:06.101 --> 32:06.741
Back in the day,

32:06.742 --> 32:09.303
you know how many women me and
Lamar Odom's dad picked up here?

32:09.338 --> 32:11.839
And keep in mind,
back then this was a marsh,

32:11.857 --> 32:14.675
where people came
to shoot at fish.

32:14.693 --> 32:17.245
There's your
low-hanging fruit.

32:17.279 --> 32:18.563
We can teach you no more.

32:18.614 --> 32:21.482
Fly, Lutz, fly.

32:27.456 --> 32:29.357
Hey, baby, what's wrong?

32:29.391 --> 32:30.925
Lutz?

32:30.959 --> 32:31.943
Mom-boss?

32:31.977 --> 32:33.094
What are you doing?

32:33.128 --> 32:35.663
Oh, my God,
Lutz just hit on Liz.

32:35.698 --> 32:37.131
About time.

32:37.166 --> 32:39.667
The last six years has been
like watching <i>Moonlighting.</i>

32:39.702 --> 32:41.486
Hang on, were
you hitting on me?

32:41.520 --> 32:42.870
I'm sorry.

32:42.905 --> 32:44.939
I just wanted to have
a nice Valentine's Day,

32:44.973 --> 32:47.475
so Frank and Tracy tried
to help me out.

32:47.509 --> 32:48.609
But I keep screwing up.

32:48.644 --> 32:50.712
Every time I get
a good thing going,

32:50.746 --> 32:52.780
I do something stupid
and blow it.

32:52.814 --> 32:54.699
You want to know the reason
why Lutz is alone?

32:54.750 --> 32:55.950
Lutz!

32:55.984 --> 32:57.351
And Dollhouse penis syndrome.

32:57.386 --> 32:59.253
Oh, my God.

32:59.288 --> 33:00.621
I'm female Lutz.

33:00.655 --> 33:01.622
I love you too.

33:01.657 --> 33:03.191
No, I mean...

33:03.225 --> 33:04.542
I'm my own worst enemy.

33:04.593 --> 33:06.661
Do you want to know
the reason Liz is alone?

33:06.695 --> 33:08.046
Liz.

33:08.097 --> 33:10.381
Also I menstruate a lot.

33:10.432 --> 33:13.067
Oh, God, does this mean
I have to change?

33:13.102 --> 33:16.087
I have to go back
and be the bigger person?

33:18.373 --> 33:20.925
What if Criss already left
and I have to go find him?

33:20.976 --> 33:24.062
It's so cold.

33:24.096 --> 33:27.048
Oh, realizations
are the worst.

33:44.096 --> 33:46.531
Excuse me,
are you Jenna Maroney?

33:46.565 --> 33:49.300
My goodness,
are these for me?

33:49.335 --> 33:50.568
Yes.

33:50.586 --> 33:51.569
For your grave.

33:51.604 --> 33:54.905
I hope you die
out there tonight.

33:58.978 --> 34:01.429
Dude, that was a disaster.

34:01.463 --> 34:03.281
Worse than me trying
to send a fax.

34:03.315 --> 34:05.400
50 straight
Valentine's days alone.

34:05.434 --> 34:07.018
I mean, 48.

34:07.052 --> 34:08.186
Are you crazy?

34:08.219 --> 34:09.187
You're not alone.

34:09.221 --> 34:11.054
You spent Valentine's with us.

34:11.089 --> 34:14.475
Yeah, two people who care
enough about your sexual needs

34:14.525 --> 34:17.110
to blow off their wives
and girlfriends.

34:17.146 --> 34:19.597
No.

34:19.614 --> 34:20.797
Right now, Angie's
in a hotel room

34:20.833 --> 34:22.199
dressed as a clown.

34:22.234 --> 34:24.402
And I'm supposed to get
into an elephant costume

34:24.436 --> 34:26.737
and interview her for
a job at the circus.

34:26.772 --> 34:29.607
I spent Valentine's Day
with friends.

34:29.625 --> 34:30.641
Friends?

34:30.676 --> 34:32.610
We are work acquaintances
at best.

34:32.645 --> 34:34.445
At worst, we are rivals

34:34.480 --> 34:38.216
who inspire and try
to make each other better.

34:38.250 --> 34:39.717
Now let's go get
some tiny meatballs.

34:39.752 --> 34:42.053
Meatballs, here we come!

34:42.087 --> 34:43.454
Meatballs!

34:43.472 --> 34:46.956
Pick up your phone, Criss.

34:46.976 --> 34:48.092
Jack, I can't talk.

34:48.127 --> 34:49.293
I am mentally writing
an apology,

34:49.311 --> 34:50.293
and it's giving me
a tension headache,

34:50.312 --> 34:51.962
and I am so cold!

34:51.981 --> 34:54.264
I want to have sex
with Avery's mother.

34:54.300 --> 34:55.733
No! You can't do that.

34:55.768 --> 34:56.801
I know.

34:56.835 --> 34:58.269
And maybe it's just
the loneliness,

34:58.304 --> 34:59.270
and the frustration,

34:59.305 --> 35:00.605
and stupid Valentine's Day.

35:00.639 --> 35:02.490
But she's amazing.

35:02.524 --> 35:04.208
And come on, didn't our friends
the ancient Olmecs

35:04.243 --> 35:06.978
bed both mother and daughter
to satisfy their Jaguar gods?

35:07.012 --> 35:10.498
- And everybody loves them.
- Jack, listen to me.

35:10.532 --> 35:12.650
That is wrong
on so many levels.

35:12.668 --> 35:14.369
You can never sleep with her,

35:14.420 --> 35:16.988
never, never, ever, ever...

35:17.022 --> 35:22.159
Never, ever, ever.
Never, ever, ever, ever!

35:22.177 --> 35:24.762
I get it, Lemon.
Thank you.

35:24.797 --> 35:26.064
Just hearing your labored
breathing while you

35:26.098 --> 35:29.200
walk up stairs has purged me
of all sexual desire.

35:29.234 --> 35:30.935
Yeah, well,
glad I could help.

35:30.969 --> 35:32.270
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to clean up

35:32.304 --> 35:33.538
the mess I made here with...

35:33.572 --> 35:34.689
Criss.

35:34.723 --> 35:35.973
You're still here.

35:36.008 --> 35:37.911
I tried to call you.

35:40.145 --> 35:42.697
20 missed calls?
How did...

35:42.731 --> 35:44.148
Right.

35:44.182 --> 35:46.350
My ringtone is
the sounds of cooking.

35:46.368 --> 35:47.919
Which is perfect,
because I love cooking.

35:47.953 --> 35:49.037
But when I'm cooking...

35:49.071 --> 35:50.154
Lemon, please hang up,

35:50.189 --> 35:51.656
I can't listen
to any more of this.

35:51.690 --> 35:55.560
Yeah.
Look...

35:55.594 --> 35:58.162
I was planning on saying
"it was my fault,"

35:58.196 --> 36:00.598
and, "please, let's
get back together."

36:00.632 --> 36:02.533
But, it doesn't
look like I need to.

36:02.568 --> 36:04.969
What do you mean,
"get back together"?

36:05.003 --> 36:06.371
You thought we broke up
because of that fight?

36:06.405 --> 36:08.139
No, that would be idiotic.

36:08.173 --> 36:09.741
You wanted a table,
I wasn't super-helpful.

36:09.775 --> 36:12.577
Who cares?
I tend to care, you know...

36:12.611 --> 36:14.545
I let little things
ruin stuff.

36:14.580 --> 36:16.814
I mean, I stopped shopping
at kmart because I found out

36:16.849 --> 36:20.718
that Kathy Ireland didn't design
any of her signature socks.

36:20.736 --> 36:22.253
But maybe, after 40 years...

36:22.287 --> 36:23.354
41.

36:23.389 --> 36:24.722
- I can change.
- Don't bother.

36:24.757 --> 36:26.858
You can get mad at dumb stuff.
That's your thing.

36:26.892 --> 36:28.626
I'll get over it.
That's my thing.

36:28.660 --> 36:30.194
It's kind of perfect.

36:30.229 --> 36:31.562
But how are we ever
going to break up?

36:31.597 --> 36:33.564
I don't know,
maybe we never will.

36:33.599 --> 36:36.367
Maybe we'll still be celebrating
Valentine's together

36:36.401 --> 36:37.869
100 years from now.

36:37.903 --> 36:40.471
Do you think
our ape overlords will let us?

36:40.506 --> 36:43.541
They'll let you and me
do whatever we want,

36:43.575 --> 36:45.777
because we'll be spying
on the rest of humanity

36:45.811 --> 36:48.613
for the ape police.

36:48.647 --> 36:50.414
Wait, where did
you get a table?

36:50.432 --> 36:51.682
I made it.

36:51.717 --> 36:55.052
I gathered fallen tree branches
from Riverside Park.

36:55.086 --> 36:56.320
That's where we first met.

36:56.355 --> 36:58.106
Yeah. And the top
is a Herman Cain poster

36:58.140 --> 36:59.724
I found in a dumpster.

37:01.627 --> 37:03.060
Excuse me?

37:03.095 --> 37:04.829
I have a package for Liz Lemon.

37:04.863 --> 37:06.096
Sure, come in.

37:06.115 --> 37:09.066
You're the head writer
<i>TGS?</i>

37:09.100 --> 37:10.768
But you're so beautiful.

37:10.803 --> 37:12.136
Charlie what now?

37:12.171 --> 37:13.538
I love your brown hair.

37:13.572 --> 37:16.908
It's so bouncy, like the
"after" picture in a lice ad.

37:16.942 --> 37:17.909
Thank you.

37:17.943 --> 37:20.578
It's from intermittent washing.

37:20.612 --> 37:21.646
And you own this place?

37:21.680 --> 37:23.297
Yeah.

37:23.332 --> 37:25.616
Holy Moly, there's stairs?

37:25.651 --> 37:27.418
And a dining room table?

37:27.453 --> 37:30.087
Is this your boyfriend?

37:30.122 --> 37:32.006
Yeah. He made me dinner.

37:32.057 --> 37:34.492
Mashed potatoes
in a Martini glass.

37:34.526 --> 37:36.427
Who are you, the president?

37:36.462 --> 37:37.528
Of France?

37:37.563 --> 37:38.930
I know, right?

37:38.964 --> 37:41.299
You are an inspiration,
Liz Lemon.

37:41.333 --> 37:42.967
I am an inspiration.

37:43.001 --> 37:44.986
I'll see you at work tomorrow.

37:45.020 --> 37:46.304
Happy Valentine's Day.

37:46.338 --> 37:47.304
You too.

37:47.322 --> 37:49.974
I want your life.

37:50.008 --> 37:52.877
And I will have it.

37:52.911 --> 37:54.145
I like her.

37:54.179 --> 37:56.330
- <i>45 seconds</i>.
- Jenna.

37:56.365 --> 37:57.715
This is a nightmare.

37:57.749 --> 38:00.218
My Nemeses, Abigail Breslin
and the woman

38:00.252 --> 38:01.419
from those progressive
insurance commercials,

38:01.453 --> 38:02.620
are in the audience.

38:02.654 --> 38:04.505
Just, relax... panic, don't.

38:04.540 --> 38:06.424
You failed me, Pete.

38:06.458 --> 38:07.825
And when I go down,
I'm taking you with me.

38:07.860 --> 38:08.826
You'll never work again.

38:08.861 --> 38:10.194
But I have five kids.

38:10.229 --> 38:11.629
And grandkids can't
be far behind,

38:11.663 --> 38:12.830
little Evelyn's so sexual.

38:12.848 --> 38:14.232
<i>30 seconds.</i>

38:23.892 --> 38:25.643
These shoes hurt, mommy.

38:25.677 --> 38:26.677
Good. Focus on the pain,

38:26.695 --> 38:28.312
not on the fact that
if you lose,

38:28.347 --> 38:30.515
I'm gonna pour acid
on your Barbies.

38:30.549 --> 38:32.817
Okay, come on.

38:37.456 --> 38:38.990
The shoes.

38:39.024 --> 38:41.459
The fire.

38:41.493 --> 38:42.460
The sword.

38:43.495 --> 38:44.462
It's the pain.

38:44.496 --> 38:46.664
She needs the pain
to distract her.

38:50.953 --> 38:52.069
I need to hurt her,

38:52.087 --> 38:53.337
but she's all the way
over there.

38:53.372 --> 38:54.605
How could I possib...

39:01.046 --> 39:03.881
Come on, Hornberger.

39:03.916 --> 39:05.633
Archer...

39:05.684 --> 39:08.185
Arch!

39:31.176 --> 39:34.345
Is she bleeding?

39:34.379 --> 39:36.547
It looks like an arrow wound.

39:42.087 --> 39:43.554
Jack.

39:43.589 --> 39:45.823
I didn't know you'd
be down here.

39:45.857 --> 39:48.092
Nice place.

39:48.126 --> 39:49.760
What did you pay for
all this wood?

39:49.795 --> 39:51.128
I don't believe we've met.

39:51.163 --> 39:54.348
Jack, this is...

39:54.399 --> 39:57.401
Someone I saw fighting with
a dog outside a liquor store.

39:57.436 --> 39:58.669
I'm Herb.

39:58.704 --> 40:01.606
'Cause you are what you smoke,
right "Jackie"?

40:01.640 --> 40:02.657
Hey, where's the head?

40:02.691 --> 40:04.075
We're in mixed company,

40:04.109 --> 40:05.910
but let's just say I've got
to go wreck your toilet.

40:05.944 --> 40:07.945
It's down that hallway
on the right-hand side.

40:12.084 --> 40:13.150
Diana, don't do this.

40:13.185 --> 40:14.919
I'm lonely, Jack.

40:14.953 --> 40:16.454
So am I.

40:16.488 --> 40:18.255
Believe me,
I know how you feel.

40:18.290 --> 40:20.675
Being alone
on Valentine's Day,

40:20.709 --> 40:22.627
frustrated
in all kinds of ways.

40:22.661 --> 40:24.662
Just wanting a connection,

40:24.696 --> 40:26.664
to hold someone's hand.

40:26.698 --> 40:30.468
Ideally when she's wearing
only a necktie.

40:30.502 --> 40:32.036
But you deserve better
than Herb.

40:32.070 --> 40:35.640
Why is this bathroom full
of wine bottles?

40:35.674 --> 40:39.610
But what I deserve,
I shouldn't have.

40:39.645 --> 40:40.711
Me neither.

40:40.746 --> 40:45.983
So, what are we going
to do about it?

40:46.018 --> 40:47.818
- Oh, baby.
- Oh, yes.

40:47.853 --> 40:48.852
- Yes! 
- That's good.

40:48.870 --> 40:50.655
- Yes.
- Oh, yeah, don't stop.

40:50.689 --> 40:52.323
- Just like that.
- Oh, yeah, but a little lower.

40:52.357 --> 40:53.557
- Yes!
- Yeah, baby!

40:53.592 --> 40:57.128
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh!

40:57.162 --> 40:59.563
- Nope, nope.
- Let me have one.

40:59.598 --> 41:02.500
Give it to him, Frank.
Give it to him, we're friends.

41:02.534 --> 41:06.387
You can have one of mine.

41:45.761 --> 41:48.212
Finally, I can say,

41:48.246 --> 41:49.380
happy Valen...

41:49.414 --> 41:50.881
My legs!

41:52.384 --> 41:53.918
This get me out of sex.

42:06.390 --> 42:08.192
My God, Liz.

42:08.285 --> 42:10.854
We're wearing
the exact same lipstick.

42:11.188 --> 42:13.890
Looks better on you,
of course.

42:13.924 --> 42:16.492
I wish I could just cut those
lips right off and wear them.

42:20.431 --> 42:23.866
Happy Valentine's Day, lovers.

42:23.901 --> 42:27.337
Happy Valentine's Day
to us all.
