00:10.945 --> 00:12.779
- _
- I think the killer's a shaman, Dan.

00:12.814 --> 00:16.242
Collecting body parts because
they think there is a monster here.

00:16.277 --> 00:17.324
A monster?

00:17.325 --> 00:18.639
Can I trust you, Dan?

00:18.674 --> 00:20.141
I am the only one you can trust.

00:20.176 --> 00:21.975
Wasn't she effectively on life support?

00:22.010 --> 00:23.306
It is a miracle, Dr. Yelburton.

00:23.341 --> 00:25.220
Something about regeneration.

00:25.256 --> 00:29.281
That weather station is still
there. If I can find that lab...

00:29.316 --> 00:31.176
I think maybe you should get some help.

00:31.211 --> 00:33.163
Erling Munk is corrupt.

00:33.198 --> 00:34.613
Why can't you love me?

00:34.649 --> 00:36.212
I care about Fortitude.

00:36.247 --> 00:37.892
LIAR!

00:37.927 --> 00:39.959
- I can't.
- No. No!

_

02:02.605 --> 02:03.925
So what do you think?

02:03.990 --> 02:05.696
Maybe he was hired by a jealous wife.

02:05.731 --> 02:08.934
Then why would an assassin leave
Zurich to live in Fortitude?

02:08.976 --> 02:12.319
So... where are we with the Ledesma girl?

02:13.290 --> 02:16.067
We haven't located the
whereabouts of, err... of Elena.

02:16.102 --> 02:20.861
Where are we with the, erm...
the, err, murdered barman...

02:20.896 --> 02:23.170
- Tomak.
- Tomak.

02:23.233 --> 02:25.935
We have a match on his fingerprints.

02:25.970 --> 02:27.877
What do we need a match
on his fingerprints for?

02:27.935 --> 02:29.223
We have his fingerprints.

02:29.250 --> 02:32.190
They are in the mortuary
at the end of his hands.

02:32.225 --> 02:35.948
No... Interpol have a thumb
and forefinger on file.

02:35.983 --> 02:37.349
Recovered from a door handle.

02:37.384 --> 02:42.639
A biopharmaceutical executive was
murdered in an R&D pharmacy lab in Zurich.

02:42.674 --> 02:47.517
The killer has never been
identified. Just these two prints.

02:47.580 --> 02:50.767
Probably holding the gun in his
right hand when he opened the door.

02:54.165 --> 02:56.791
His phones. You have an expert...?

02:56.826 --> 02:57.761
Petter Hansen.

02:57.796 --> 03:00.630
Mr. Hansen couldn't get into his phones.

03:01.822 --> 03:05.536
So... irrelevant.

03:06.281 --> 03:11.403
Irrelevant. Irrelevant!

03:14.967 --> 03:17.553
His heart was cut out.

03:18.306 --> 03:20.638
His head was cut off.

03:20.673 --> 03:26.411
Her head too! They're all dead.
One man is alive. The killer.

03:26.446 --> 03:28.294
The... the... the...
the... the... the nutcase.

03:28.363 --> 03:31.296
The... the serial psychopath.

03:31.371 --> 03:38.176
Stop wasting time on... on
diagrams and string and...

03:39.651 --> 03:40.501
get...

03:40.559 --> 03:41.629
Find him!

03:41.754 --> 03:44.846
Find the killer! Arrest the man or woman!

03:45.661 --> 03:49.435
Find the missing girl as
well. Get fucking finding!

03:49.470 --> 03:50.898
Governor Munk, if we...

03:50.945 --> 03:54.711
Governor and Chief of Police.

03:56.227 --> 03:57.328
Chief.

03:58.684 --> 03:59.722
Police.

04:04.187 --> 04:08.722
I want... I want...

04:12.403 --> 04:14.262
I want results!

04:20.281 --> 04:22.402
RESULTS!

04:22.728 --> 04:25.130
Fuck. Petra, I thought
<i>you</i> had problem.

04:31.042 --> 04:35.595
We got about another, err,
twenty three kilometres.

04:35.630 --> 04:38.400
We'll be there by lunch
if the weather holds.

04:45.573 --> 04:46.723
What's that?

04:49.293 --> 04:50.639
Magnum.

04:50.723 --> 04:52.191
I didn't know you had a magnum.

04:52.248 --> 04:54.484
- It's for bear.
- Bear?

04:54.722 --> 04:56.471
She's right.

04:56.561 --> 05:01.867
It's the only handgun that
can stop a bear. So they say.

05:02.421 --> 05:03.660
Can I try?

05:07.155 --> 05:09.566
Come on, what if you're in the
tent asleep, and I have to grab the

05:09.616 --> 05:11.706
handgun? I need to know
how to shoot it. Come on.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.663
Or you might get eaten by a bear.

05:22.631 --> 05:24.294
Is it loaded?

05:24.393 --> 05:25.863
It's loaded.

05:26.498 --> 05:28.199
What shall I shoot?

05:28.280 --> 05:31.078
Don't know. Not much to aim at.

05:31.199 --> 05:36.580
I don't to see any cans or bottles or
any of that traditional shoot-at shit.

05:37.741 --> 05:39.076
Shoot him.

05:40.489 --> 05:41.743
What?

05:41.778 --> 05:45.510
- Shoot your father.
- What?

05:47.002 --> 05:50.806
If you love me... shoot him.

05:52.067 --> 05:54.254
He knows too much.

05:54.406 --> 05:56.886
No one will ever find his body out here.

06:26.748 --> 06:28.875
Don't fuck around with this thing!

06:29.690 --> 06:33.089
Look at you two. The father and the son!

06:33.132 --> 06:35.333
Like a fucking Greek Tragedy.

06:43.649 --> 06:45.254
Don't fuck around.

06:53.781 --> 06:57.722
Vladek, I brought you some food.

07:01.135 --> 07:02.502
Vladek?

07:02.902 --> 07:04.185
Vladek?!

07:36.666 --> 07:37.930
Freya.

07:55.187 --> 07:56.842
There we go, Freya.

07:57.613 --> 08:01.570
This, this sickness...

08:01.970 --> 08:06.287
It will do this more and
more. Your strength failing.

08:06.322 --> 08:10.610
Your throat won't swallow. Then your
lungs will stop bringing you air.

08:18.077 --> 08:22.332
I can do one thing for you before I go.

08:23.690 --> 08:25.248
Let you choose.

08:25.344 --> 08:29.337
Part of you can always be with me, Freya.

08:29.782 --> 08:31.954
- No!
- Live on in death.

08:32.008 --> 08:37.369
You can help me. You are a healer.

08:37.437 --> 08:40.847
I felt it. Your strength inside me.

08:40.909 --> 08:44.217
Every morsel of that strength
is needed for what I have to do.

08:44.301 --> 08:46.465
Healing you would cost too much of it.

08:46.500 --> 08:47.895
It's...

08:47.972 --> 08:52.469
One dying woman or a
whole town. You understand?

08:52.504 --> 08:57.331
Please... don't leave me, please.

09:51.764 --> 09:53.341
What are you doing?

09:53.416 --> 09:56.420
Wi-Fi's down in my lab. Just
needed to check my emails.

09:56.486 --> 09:59.126
There's nothing urgent thank goodness.

10:02.490 --> 10:04.930
You always have the reindeer burger.

10:07.405 --> 10:09.005
What about the lutefische?

10:09.040 --> 10:12.527
Tourists occasionally
try it. But only once.

10:12.975 --> 10:14.397
Bring me that.

10:14.825 --> 10:17.570
On your own head be it.

10:46.090 --> 10:48.570
You worked out how to wear your anorak.

10:55.656 --> 11:00.455
What did it mean, the
tongue? Some kind of warning?

11:00.490 --> 11:06.049
No. No, it, err... it singled you out.

11:06.158 --> 11:08.706
- How?
- You didn't follow the herd.

11:11.250 --> 11:12.731
Eric shot you?

11:13.438 --> 11:15.176
- Yes.
- Hmm.

11:15.262 --> 11:16.974
I got shot once.

11:17.036 --> 11:19.905
It hurt so fucking much
I couldn't believe it.

11:19.979 --> 11:21.821
I couldn't stop being sick.

11:21.898 --> 11:22.511
Hmm.

11:22.594 --> 11:24.302
- You look well enough.
- Hmm.

11:24.388 --> 11:25.882
A little gaunt perhaps.

11:25.949 --> 11:31.618
Well, shamanism is an agonistic practice.

11:31.704 --> 11:32.615
"Agonistic"?

11:32.696 --> 11:38.042
The spiritual currency is,
is... I suppose it's pain.

11:38.122 --> 11:41.862
Sacrifice, agonies, torments.

11:41.897 --> 11:45.318
And then... more pain.

11:45.381 --> 11:51.024
Mm-hmm. Not just your pain though.
Other people get accounted too.

11:51.075 --> 11:51.777
Mm.

11:51.832 --> 11:57.249
Hindemith, Tavrani,
Bianca, the barman upstairs.

11:57.304 --> 12:02.809
These are wrongs, evils,
injustices that are balanced out.

12:02.864 --> 12:05.204
And who's going to "balance" you out?

12:09.690 --> 12:11.409
You.

12:11.469 --> 12:13.929
What, now?

12:13.984 --> 12:14.777
No.

12:17.450 --> 12:20.204
When you become the demon.

12:21.132 --> 12:22.368
Oh, right.

12:25.330 --> 12:29.529
You're a lunatic. A
see-into-the-future psychopath.

12:29.530 --> 12:32.006
A self-appointed voodoo nutjob.

12:32.041 --> 12:36.049
How many days since you woke up, five?

12:36.088 --> 12:38.763
Because your recovery rate is remarkable.

12:38.798 --> 12:39.313
Well...

12:39.352 --> 12:42.557
But that's not quite right, is
it? Because recovery implies you're

12:42.592 --> 12:45.823
getting back to normal, and that's
not what's happening, is it, Dan?

12:45.858 --> 12:48.314
You're changing. Aren't you?

12:49.330 --> 12:53.301
Aren't you? Appetites for
things you've never tried.

12:53.389 --> 12:55.189
Dark thoughts.

12:57.049 --> 12:58.489
Enjoy.

13:00.941 --> 13:03.421
The dissolution of empathy.

13:03.456 --> 13:04.878
You know nothing about me.

13:04.913 --> 13:06.085
Mm.

13:10.895 --> 13:12.674
If I am this...

13:12.770 --> 13:18.750
demon, and you're a shaman, why
don't you just kill me and have

13:18.785 --> 13:19.901
done with it?

13:21.210 --> 13:25.697
Because you're not the demon
yet. You might think this is it.

13:25.769 --> 13:29.159
But it's not. You have a
way to go before he's here.

13:29.229 --> 13:32.003
Before the healing can happen.

13:32.397 --> 13:36.934
Well, when I am him, shaman.

13:39.104 --> 13:40.948
I'll come find you.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.337
This is Governor Odegard. Leave a message.

15:39.345 --> 15:40.548
Have you seen Hildur?

15:40.623 --> 15:44.866
Err, no. I... I thought
you were her just now.

15:44.931 --> 15:47.012
I heard the door.

15:47.066 --> 15:50.984
She's not slept in her bed,
she's not answering her phone.

15:52.048 --> 15:53.208
Oh?

16:01.111 --> 16:04.230
We had words. Angry words.

16:04.296 --> 16:07.397
We, err... we had a fight.

16:08.651 --> 16:11.000
A fight?

16:11.035 --> 16:14.595
Yes. And now she's gone.

16:17.738 --> 16:22.691
She'll, erm... she'll turn up, Eric.

16:25.363 --> 16:31.057
Meantime, you've had your
instructions. Results.

16:49.265 --> 16:50.366
There it is.

17:58.226 --> 17:59.905
This is the place.

18:03.930 --> 18:08.018
This is the table. They
cut the guy up. In the film.

18:08.092 --> 18:09.532
Somebody's been here.

18:17.914 --> 18:20.299
They could be watching us.

18:20.345 --> 18:22.579
What did you think you would find here?

18:22.614 --> 18:26.573
I don't know. A miracle.

18:28.019 --> 18:29.168
Something...

18:35.512 --> 18:38.632
Epinephrine. Make your
breathing a lot easier.

18:41.425 --> 18:42.888
Gives you strength.

18:45.785 --> 18:50.462
When was asthma diagnosed, Freya?

18:50.511 --> 18:55.340
In Tromso. Last year.
Michael and I were visiting.

18:55.375 --> 19:00.991
I had an attack. There's asthma
in my family, so I... I knew.

19:03.265 --> 19:07.028
- Would you squeeze my hand, Freya?
- What?

19:07.073 --> 19:09.696
Go on. Squeeze my hand.

19:16.911 --> 19:18.356
Hard as you can.

19:27.690 --> 19:33.730
The young man who came for me.
I do not know him. Who is he?

19:33.799 --> 19:35.510
Erm, he...

19:36.090 --> 19:39.784
he did some work. He's an electrician.

19:39.907 --> 19:42.301
And what is the young man's name?

19:43.246 --> 19:45.238
I don't think he ever said.

19:49.982 --> 19:54.067
You're telling me so many lies,
Freya. Why are you doing that?

20:00.185 --> 20:02.436
I think we should pray together.

20:02.518 --> 20:03.795
Oh, I do.

20:07.399 --> 20:09.693
I would like that very much.

20:18.216 --> 20:24.335
Dear Father in Heaven, look
kindly on my sister Freya.

20:24.745 --> 20:27.312
You see the ordeal set beyond.

20:28.265 --> 20:32.838
Grant us strength, courage and healing.

20:37.345 --> 20:41.805
I've seen a newborn reindeer
so completely overwhelmed by

20:41.875 --> 20:44.525
blood-sucking black fly,
that it collapsed and died.

20:44.591 --> 20:47.365
The tiny little fuckers just
sucked so much blood out of bambi.

20:47.400 --> 20:48.926
That bambi kicked the bucket.

20:49.320 --> 20:51.489
Polar bears shouldn't
be susceptible. Their...

20:51.524 --> 20:54.243
their coat is, is in
order of thickness that...

20:54.278 --> 20:55.199
Who's this?

20:55.250 --> 20:58.115
You told me you thought I
should get help, so I got help.

20:58.190 --> 20:59.523
I didn't mean that kind of help. I meant...

20:59.594 --> 21:00.777
I know what you meant.

21:00.827 --> 21:03.149
This is Doctor Yelburton... she
used to work here, but now she

21:03.184 --> 21:05.424
works in Khatri's lab of death.

21:05.495 --> 21:06.829
I need to talk to you.

21:06.900 --> 21:10.921
Oh, now you need my help.
Anyway, where were we?

21:10.956 --> 21:12.121
Vincent!

21:12.624 --> 21:15.764
Look, you're... you're making my
placement student uncomfortable. Look.

21:15.854 --> 21:18.192
I have to talk to you now about
something very important...

21:18.265 --> 21:20.988
And I have to continue examining
this bear tissue from the bear

21:21.046 --> 21:24.771
who died of anemia, cos I'd like to
find out what caused that anemia...

21:24.841 --> 21:28.887
Possibly some sort of blood-sucking
irritant that wouldn't leave it alone.

21:30.092 --> 21:34.899
No, don't write that down.
Let's start on these blood cells.

21:38.859 --> 21:45.251
You know, when my uncle brought me
here, we sat up all night talking.

21:45.324 --> 21:47.930
He told me about what happened here.

21:48.015 --> 21:52.076
Neither of us knew that D'Yavol
was on the other side of the door.

21:52.145 --> 21:53.475
What is D'Yavol?

21:56.570 --> 21:58.720
He is a monster...

22:00.781 --> 22:06.746
who comes and causes
atrocity, you cannot kill him.

22:08.033 --> 22:09.772
You saw him on that film.

22:12.681 --> 22:20.394
What if it was not them who broke
in, but it was D'Yavol who broke out?

22:30.855 --> 22:34.269
Ragh!

22:36.984 --> 22:38.404
My dad thinks you're trouble.

22:38.501 --> 22:39.981
Of course I'm trouble.

22:55.693 --> 22:56.693
Fuck!

23:11.201 --> 23:15.081
Rune. Hey. Hey, help me move this.

23:21.217 --> 23:24.227
There's something in there. UGH!

23:27.054 --> 23:28.166
Put it down.

23:29.188 --> 23:30.532
It's locked.

23:32.869 --> 23:34.424
Yeah!

23:46.665 --> 23:47.803
It's muscimol.

23:50.424 --> 23:53.973
Look! A fly agaric.

23:53.985 --> 23:55.574
We can mix some more.

23:58.865 --> 24:00.225
What?

24:01.904 --> 24:02.967
What is it?

24:05.498 --> 24:07.141
What, Rune?

24:10.505 --> 24:12.178
Rune, what?!

24:12.244 --> 24:14.394
Is this the reason why you brought us here?

24:17.054 --> 24:18.074
Right.

24:18.136 --> 24:22.705
Rune... Don't tell him, Rune.

24:26.708 --> 24:31.516
Ketamin and opioids. There
really can't be any innocent

24:31.551 --> 24:33.275
explanation for this.

24:33.354 --> 24:38.218
Elucidate for me, in my
ignorance, if you would be so good.

24:44.889 --> 24:48.773
This drug combination which was
on a repeat prescription to the lab

24:48.808 --> 24:51.954
can only have one purpose.

24:52.001 --> 24:53.485
Which would be what?

24:53.583 --> 24:57.006
Which would be to sedate someone
who would otherwise wake up.

24:58.705 --> 25:03.727
Is that an opinion or an "expert" opinion?

25:05.071 --> 25:06.469
"Expert".

25:06.547 --> 25:14.506
So... it's your contention that Elena
Ledesma was being kept in a coma?

25:14.541 --> 25:17.060
- Worse than that.
- Worse?

25:17.145 --> 25:23.184
Kept in a coma and experimented
on. Cut and violated.

25:23.185 --> 25:26.264
Which amounts to vivisection.

25:26.323 --> 25:28.982
- By Doctor Khatri?
- Yes.

25:30.351 --> 25:35.109
Do you have, erm, any other
corroborative evidence?

25:35.151 --> 25:38.678
Yeah, I'm preparing to make DNA
comparison of tissue samples.

25:38.748 --> 25:41.607
Samples which I believe Khatri
removed from a living patient

25:41.675 --> 25:43.666
without consent.

25:44.670 --> 25:48.410
And when will these results made available?

25:48.478 --> 25:49.464
Soon.

25:51.065 --> 25:52.224
Well...

25:53.978 --> 25:58.301
I would like to ask you something
completely off the record,

25:58.336 --> 25:59.993
Miss Yelburton.

26:00.028 --> 26:01.209
Okay.

26:04.978 --> 26:09.414
Do you think there might be a
connection with what you have

26:09.489 --> 26:17.749
discovered and the dreadful
events these recent days?

26:18.313 --> 26:19.443
I do.

26:23.258 --> 26:24.938
I do too.

26:30.214 --> 26:32.100
You're not wearing a white-suit.

26:32.268 --> 26:36.446
Fuck that. We have a big fucking problem.

26:49.530 --> 26:50.562
Hey.

26:51.617 --> 26:52.560
Are you okay, Eric?

26:52.632 --> 26:55.399
I'm, err, thinking. Working things out.

26:55.476 --> 26:58.710
Any word from Hildur? Eric?
You heard anything yet?

26:58.753 --> 27:00.923
Do we have a strategy? Eric?

27:00.977 --> 27:04.863
An investigative strategy based
on Governor Munk's priorities?

27:04.937 --> 27:08.008
We need you to tell us
what to do next, Eric.

27:08.643 --> 27:09.699
Eric?

27:10.178 --> 27:11.607
I'm thinking.

27:38.199 --> 27:42.679
- That good?
- It tickles. It's good.

27:44.923 --> 27:51.623
I don't know much about...
conditioner or stuff like that.

27:53.139 --> 27:55.130
Probably neither did Henry.

27:55.762 --> 27:59.181
Probably if he had any here,
I drank it when I was purging.

27:59.802 --> 28:01.978
I wanna tell you something.

28:06.225 --> 28:10.273
I died. When you shot me.

28:15.625 --> 28:20.870
I can't imagine what that
must have been like...

28:21.345 --> 28:29.230
No, not imagine. Truly died.
On the floor, after you shot me.

28:29.265 --> 28:34.299
I was dead in the ambulance,
in the operating room.

28:34.370 --> 28:39.703
And all the time I was
in Khatri's laboratory,

28:40.977 --> 28:45.296
I was really in the land of the dead.

28:45.345 --> 28:47.864
She kept you in an induced coma.

28:47.865 --> 28:53.181
No. In the land of the dead.

28:55.730 --> 28:59.612
When I was there, a man found me.

29:01.546 --> 29:06.472
There was no man. You were in a coma.

29:08.209 --> 29:09.862
He was a shaman.

29:19.385 --> 29:21.470
What did the shaman want?

29:23.528 --> 29:25.306
He asked me about you.

29:31.546 --> 29:33.395
What did you tell him?

29:35.065 --> 29:36.670
Everything.

29:39.355 --> 29:41.835
I told him everything I knew about you.

29:50.418 --> 29:53.501
I'm going to ask you to close your eyes.

30:34.668 --> 30:39.302
I also told him that you once
said you would kill yourself

30:39.359 --> 30:41.158
rather than hurt me.

30:43.217 --> 30:44.656
Up you get.

31:01.305 --> 31:07.634
Big bear hug. What did he say?

31:08.691 --> 31:14.470
He said the man who made that
promise would never break it.

31:14.533 --> 31:20.230
And he said that the only thing
that was holding Fortitude together

31:20.310 --> 31:22.736
was Dan Anderssen the Sheriff.

31:24.082 --> 31:29.073
Not jobs or money, not
Governor Odegard... just Dan and

31:29.147 --> 31:33.025
without him, this place
would be condemned to agony

31:33.088 --> 31:35.085
at the hands of a monster.

31:36.305 --> 31:37.846
That's right.

31:41.695 --> 31:43.579
You're not Dan.

31:46.654 --> 31:48.243
I wanna go.

31:48.865 --> 31:51.144
You're staying right here.

31:51.215 --> 31:55.184
No. I wanna go back.

31:55.185 --> 32:01.321
I am never, ever, going
to let you go again.

32:05.345 --> 32:09.905
Dan Anderssen could never let Elena go.

32:11.385 --> 32:20.381
And... if I'm not Dan, then who am I?

32:26.410 --> 32:31.461
Dan would never let Elena
leave him for another man.

32:37.722 --> 32:41.646
And if she ever tried to
leave him for another man,

32:47.644 --> 32:50.385
God knows what he would do.

33:57.735 --> 33:58.586
Hey.

33:58.651 --> 33:59.515
Hey.

34:04.326 --> 34:05.448
Where is Michael?

34:05.535 --> 34:08.335
Hunting trip. Him and Rune.

34:12.860 --> 34:15.179
Things I need to know.

34:15.257 --> 34:20.534
Ingrid won't tell me cos... she's
caught between her job and her family.

34:21.255 --> 34:23.042
Conflicted loyalties.

34:25.024 --> 34:27.389
Things I have to know, Freya.

34:29.248 --> 34:33.126
- What things?
- Tell me the truth.

34:36.456 --> 34:38.454
Is Michael with Hildur?

34:38.589 --> 34:40.603
Is that what's happening?

34:40.721 --> 34:45.469
No, Eric, believe me... that
is not what is happening at all.

34:47.871 --> 34:48.887
Swear to me.

34:48.922 --> 34:53.808
I'm sure, Eric. You don't
have to worry about that.

34:57.770 --> 34:59.391
Oh, Christ.

35:02.265 --> 35:04.984
I've so fucked up.

35:04.985 --> 35:06.126
I know.

35:10.425 --> 35:11.786
We all have.

35:18.970 --> 35:22.569
Are you okay? I hardly
see you in town anymore.

35:22.631 --> 35:26.270
Is everything alright with you?

35:26.305 --> 35:30.446
Everything's fine. I'm fine.

35:30.511 --> 35:31.445
What're you burning?

35:31.480 --> 35:35.488
Just old rags. Clearing up a mess.

35:41.194 --> 35:43.197
You look after yourself, okay?

36:00.056 --> 36:03.610
Suddenly, you don't want anything
to do with the reindeer juice.

36:06.185 --> 36:09.808
You loved the reindeer juice when
it was just you and me doing it.

36:11.225 --> 36:13.283
My mum is very sick.

36:16.425 --> 36:19.006
I know your mum is very sick...

36:19.812 --> 36:24.493
It's killing my dad. He's lost.

36:25.425 --> 36:27.744
My dad is a very tough guy, right?

36:27.745 --> 36:29.345
I mean, he goes out into the ocean.

36:29.380 --> 36:33.065
He can beat you with his fists.
He's... Well, he's pretty smart.

36:33.116 --> 36:36.560
Like... It's like you said, you
know? He... he's a sexy motherfucker.

36:39.945 --> 36:42.104
Sexy motherfucker.

36:42.175 --> 36:43.668
My mum is too.

36:53.157 --> 36:55.237
DAD! GET OFF HIM!

37:01.351 --> 37:04.749
D'Yavol! D'Yavol!

37:04.854 --> 37:06.435
D'Yavol!

37:32.067 --> 37:33.267
AH!

37:33.633 --> 37:35.167
Let go. Let go.

37:38.987 --> 37:40.247
Stay back.

37:42.806 --> 37:43.994
Shit.

37:49.465 --> 37:51.096
- You alright?
- Yes.

37:58.225 --> 37:59.704
She's missing an eye.

38:01.705 --> 38:03.713
Fuck. She's a Russian soldier.

38:03.748 --> 38:06.329
We drop her down a crevice.

38:08.312 --> 38:09.959
Yeah, we could do that.

38:10.571 --> 38:14.184
No one will find her, we drop
her down a fucking crevice.

38:14.219 --> 38:15.976
No one will ever know. We
drop her down a fucking crev...

38:16.011 --> 38:17.414
- She's a person.
- Shut up!

38:17.474 --> 38:19.919
You shot her,
y-y-you killed her.

38:21.296 --> 38:22.411
Dad!

38:27.911 --> 38:29.510
We're gonna take her back to Fortitude.

38:29.545 --> 38:31.108
NO!

38:31.160 --> 38:33.775
Tell Eric exactly what happened.

38:35.014 --> 38:38.156
She'll get a proper burial.

38:38.381 --> 38:39.755
Her family...

38:41.625 --> 38:43.184
everything.

38:47.665 --> 38:50.544
Rune, go get the tent.

38:50.545 --> 38:54.504
We'll wrap her up in
it, put her on my skidoo.

38:54.505 --> 38:55.605
Go ahead.

40:14.865 --> 40:16.332
I want to...

40:19.810 --> 40:21.726
I want to tell you something.

40:24.511 --> 40:28.386
I died when I first met you.

40:30.591 --> 40:36.950
I walked into the interview
room with your file in my hand,

40:36.985 --> 40:42.464
and there you were, at the
other side of the table.

40:42.537 --> 40:46.880
I had to stare down at your
file to get my breath back.

40:48.391 --> 40:49.735
I looked up.

40:52.991 --> 40:55.190
And I was a dead man.

40:55.258 --> 41:01.135
Lost with all the other dead men.

41:05.545 --> 41:07.785
But now, I'm alive.

41:11.173 --> 41:14.409
And they have you all to themselves.

41:35.951 --> 41:37.048
Stop.

41:46.426 --> 41:50.290
A single degree warming across
the archipelago is turning a

41:50.371 --> 41:56.570
million square kilometres of frozen
permafrost into thawed perma...

41:56.705 --> 41:58.168
nonfrost.

41:59.583 --> 42:01.497
Bad.

42:01.532 --> 42:02.537
Yep.

42:05.505 --> 42:08.227
It'll become very boggy underfoot.

42:11.425 --> 42:13.945
Very boggy, yeah.

42:16.734 --> 42:22.502
Eric is lost. Munk is
a drunken lying fucker.

42:24.745 --> 42:28.783
Dan is not Dan. Odegard has left us.

42:30.073 --> 42:32.083
Maybe I should take charge.

42:38.494 --> 42:40.940
In the bay! There's a body!

42:41.013 --> 42:42.226
There's someone in the water!

42:42.288 --> 42:43.752
- Oh, no.
- Floating!

42:52.385 --> 42:53.857
There, see?

42:58.545 --> 42:59.900
Someone get a boat.

43:01.618 --> 43:04.817
Oh, Christ. It is. It's a body.

43:04.935 --> 43:06.057
Give me those.

43:18.028 --> 43:20.230
Dan, come back!

43:20.864 --> 43:23.257
He can't do this. He'll die.
You can't go in that water.

43:26.699 --> 43:29.684
- Jesus Christ.
- Dan, what are you doing?

43:29.719 --> 43:32.440
- DAN ANDERSSEN, COME BACK!
- DAN, COME BACK!

43:32.508 --> 43:34.711
Dan!

43:34.769 --> 43:36.285
- Dan!
- Stop!

43:51.842 --> 43:54.850
His muscles will seize
up. His heart will stop.

45:21.514 --> 45:23.133
- _
- You shouldn't have come.

45:23.347 --> 45:25.482
Don't you just turn your back on me.

45:25.684 --> 45:27.341
Because one of them's hiding here.

45:28.558 --> 45:30.140
I need to see you.
