so, for Christmas... here?
Do you guys wanna come--?

00:57.641 --> 01:01.479
No, I thought we were going to be here.
We're going to his parents' house.

01:01.479 --> 01:03.814
We've gotta just do it.
It'll be all right, I know.

01:03.814 --> 01:05.107
It's gonna be the worst,
is what it's gonna be.

01:05.107 --> 01:06.192
- It-- it will be the worst.
- It's gonna be--

01:06.192 --> 01:09.028
But then we'll be back,
and it will be over, right?

01:09.028 --> 01:10.112
- It will be fast.
- Yeah.

01:10.112 --> 01:13.365
I'll have just been, like, driven insane
by your dad for, like, four days.

01:13.365 --> 01:15.493
We're gonna try and keep them
off the sauce this year. Yeah.

01:15.493 --> 01:17.036

talking anymore, even, like?

01:32.635 --> 01:35.471
No. No. We haven't talked.
We're not talking.

01:35.471 --> 01:39.308
His family on the other hand--
they're pretty great.

01:40.976 --> 01:43.479
Just 'cause I dumped him doesn't mean
I have to dump the family.

01:43.479 --> 01:45.064
It kinda does, though.

01:45.064 --> 01:47.483
God, I wish I could dump your family.

01:47.483 --> 01:48.567
I-- I know.

01:48.567 --> 01:50.528
Wish I could dump them
in the garbage.

-  <i>I do.</i>

02:22.434 --> 02:24.061
Taste it, and tell me
if you think I'm crazy.

02:24.061 --> 02:25.771
- Really? Okay.
- Yeah.

02:31.402 --> 02:33.779
Oh, my God. This is so good.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.658
- First cookie's free.
- That's how they get you.

02:39.243 --> 02:42.162
I have a question.
Was this coffee our first date,

02:42.162 --> 02:44.331
or did lunch at the office count?

02:45.916 --> 02:50.045
Good question. Uh,
what if it was coffee today

02:50.045 --> 02:52.339
and also some dinner tonight?

02:54.884 --> 02:55.968
<i>Let's do it.</i>

02:56.719 --> 02:58.637
Oh. I forgot my-- my phone.

02:58.637 --> 03:00.306
You always forget your phone.

03:00.306 --> 03:03.767
So, I'm with the boxes,
and you're with the glasses of wine?

03:03.767 --> 03:05.811
- Yeah. But one's for you.
- Okay.

03:05.811 --> 03:08.314
Welcome home.

03:08.314 --> 03:11.066
- Aw. I love our house.
- I love your house.

03:11.066 --> 03:12.818
- So-- Hey!
- Hey.

03:12.818 --> 03:14.612
- It's our house.
- Thank you.

03:27.625 --> 03:28.626
Bah humbug.

03:49.647 --> 03:51.941
- Cheers!
- Merry Christmas, everyone!

04:01.700 --> 04:03.369
Eh-ow!

04:03.369 --> 04:04.870
Whoa. You looking at porn?

04:04.870 --> 04:05.955
No.

04:05.955 --> 04:08.374
Hey, we're taking tequila shots.
You down?

04:08.374 --> 04:11.377
Uh-- No. Thank you, Mr. Tusk.
I got a lot of work to do.

04:11.377 --> 04:13.879
- That's exactly the answer I wanted.
- Oh.

04:13.879 --> 04:15.839
You're my head designer.
I need you right here.

04:15.839 --> 04:19.176
That's me. Just, uh--
work, work, work, work, work.

04:19.176 --> 04:22.930
Oh. We're moving the launch date
of Poof 'n' Puff up to Christmas.

04:22.930 --> 04:26.183
Christmas like, like--
like next week Christmas?

04:26.183 --> 04:30.729
You get this done, I can grant you
an additional thousand stock options.

04:30.729 --> 04:33.107
And you can maybe buy
something nice for your wife.

04:33.107 --> 04:37.569
Uh, well, my fiancée and I, uh,
called it off, like, six months ago. So--

04:37.569 --> 04:40.155
Oh, that's good.
Eyes on the prize.

04:40.155 --> 04:41.657
Merry Christmas, everybody!

05:02.094 --> 05:03.387
- Hello.
-  <i>Hi, sweetie.</i>

05:03.387 --> 05:06.724
<i>Just calling to check in. It's
officially seven days until Christmas,</i>

05:06.724 --> 05:09.184
and we're so excited that you're coming.
Thank you, honey bun.

05:09.184 --> 05:10.686

05:13.439 --> 05:14.898
Ooh. I know what I wanted to tell you.

05:14.898 --> 05:17.234
I got, uh, the ham, but, uh,
this time I got it from Anthony's.

05:17.234 --> 05:19.486
- I hope you don't mind. Your dad likes it.
-  <i>Mom--</i>

05:19.486 --> 05:21.113
They have the best dead pigs.

05:22.406 --> 05:23.657
Oh, my God.

05:23.657 --> 05:27.453
<i>Grahamgy! What do you
call a snowman with a six-pack?</i>

05:27.453 --> 05:29.580
The abdominal snowman!

05:29.580 --> 05:32.041
- My barber told me that!

05:33.542 --> 05:36.003
<i>Well, there's
plenty more where that came from.</i>

05:37.087 --> 05:40.174
Mom, I can't barely hear you guys.
Are you on the landline? I can't hear--

05:40.174 --> 05:42.634
The landline has been proven
to have much better sound quality

05:42.634 --> 05:44.595
than a mobile phone.
Everybody knows that.

05:44.595 --> 05:45.846
Fifty years we've had this sucker.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.264
That's absolutely right.

05:47.264 --> 05:48.515
- Ohh!

05:48.515 --> 05:50.476
<i>See? See? And it didn't break.
That's the good news. Here. Whoops.</i>

05:50.476 --> 05:52.811
It sounds like you've
had it for 50 years.

05:52.811 --> 05:54.897
-  <i>Now, where are we?</i>
- Hello?

05:54.897 --> 05:56.148
Yep. Go ahead. We're both here.

05:58.609 --> 06:01.528
I can't come home this year, okay?

06:01.528 --> 06:03.238
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>
- What?

06:03.238 --> 06:05.157
- Is that a joke?
- <i>No.</i>

06:05.157 --> 06:07.493
It's not a joke.
I have a deadline, okay?

06:07.493 --> 06:10.579
I have to be-- I have to get
the game done by Christmas.

06:10.579 --> 06:12.664
<i>- Don't kid with Mommy.
- </i>  I'm not kidding.

06:12.664 --> 06:13.916
- Don't kid with Mommy.
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

06:13.916 --> 06:15.459
Don't kid with Mommy, honey.

06:15.459 --> 06:18.420
<i>I have a deadline of Christmas,
and I have to work.</i>

06:18.420 --> 06:20.339
- No, no.
- No, no.

06:20.339 --> 06:21.423
Okay.

06:22.674 --> 06:25.135
<i>Graham, you've got to come home.</i>

06:25.135 --> 06:28.097
<i>Your mother has been decorating
the house since Halloween!</i>

06:28.097 --> 06:30.224
Yeah.
She does that every year, Dad.

06:30.224 --> 06:31.308
<i>Okay. You know what,
here's what we'll do.</i>

06:31.308 --> 06:33.143
<i>- I'll call your boss, all right?</i>
- No.

06:33.143 --> 06:35.020
I'll call your boss
and explain the situation

06:35.020 --> 06:36.730
that we take Christmas very seriously.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.233
No. I'd really prefer you not to do that.

06:39.233 --> 06:40.734
<i>You know what I think is really happening?</i>

06:40.734 --> 06:44.738
I think this has less to do with work
and maybe a lot more to do with Ali.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.990
- Ali.
- Because, well---

06:46.990 --> 06:48.450
'Cause, 'cause what, Dad?

06:48.450 --> 06:51.870
'Cause Ali dumped me? Ditched me?
Ripped out my heart, stomped on it?

06:51.870 --> 06:54.123
- Okay.
<i>- This has nothing to do with that.</i>

06:54.123 --> 06:56.291
I have a deadline. I have to run.
I gotta work.

06:56.291 --> 06:57.876
- I can't even hear you on the landline.
-  <i>No, no, no, no.</i>

06:57.876 --> 06:59.461
-  <i>Graham! Graham!</i>
- Goodbye.

07:00.963 --> 07:03.549
<i>It's the gift
that matters most this Christmas.</i>

07:03.549 --> 07:06.802
<i>Because after all, who wants
to be alone for the holidays?</i>

07:09.555 --> 07:12.141
<i>Tired? Stressed? Single?</i>

07:12.141 --> 07:16.645
What is this ad for?
Who's this ad for? Who made this?

07:17.729 --> 07:19.398
No, no, no, no.

07:20.065 --> 07:22.609
Remote. Remote. Remote.

07:24.820 --> 07:28.365
You can do this. Graham, you got this.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.951
Okay. Ready.

07:32.995 --> 07:33.996
Set.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.249
Yes! No!

Well, Graham.

08:10.699 --> 08:12.201
This is rock bottom.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.163

I wish Heather
could have come.

09:06.463 --> 09:08.590
I know,
but she's busy with her podcast.

09:08.590 --> 09:12.010
It's called, uh,
Don't Tie Me Down.

09:12.010 --> 09:15.097
- And it's all about singles in the city.
- Ah--

09:15.097 --> 09:16.348
She talks about polyamory

09:16.348 --> 09:21.770
and, um, not kind of feeling
constrained or non-committal.

09:21.770 --> 09:24.731
Polyamory?
Didn't they play Coachella?

09:25.607 --> 09:27.985
Yeah. I think they did. Yeah.

09:28.944 --> 09:30.821
What? Um-- What is that?

09:30.821 --> 09:32.406
It's for Aunt Mildred.

09:32.406 --> 09:34.783
Oh, she's gonna love it.
She needs that.

09:34.783 --> 09:36.576
- Yeah. It's just a...
- Surprise!

09:44.793 --> 09:46.086
Graham, what are you doing here?

09:46.628 --> 09:49.673
Uh... nothing, Mom, just
spending Christmas with my family.

09:49.673 --> 09:52.050
- But you were-- you-- you--
- Don't have any bags?

09:52.050 --> 09:55.721
No, they lost everything. All my clothes,
the amazing gifts I got you guys.

09:55.721 --> 09:57.556
Thank God I held onto my laptop.

10:03.020 --> 10:04.521
You know,
when I pictured this in my head,

10:04.521 --> 10:07.107
there was, like, tears
of happiness and joy and--

10:07.107 --> 10:09.985
Oh, honey! Oh, Graham,
I'm so happy you're here!

10:09.985 --> 10:11.111
- Oh, Graham!
- Thank you for coming home!

10:11.111 --> 10:12.446
You might want to tell your face.

10:12.446 --> 10:14.239
- Graham is here!
- I love you.

10:14.239 --> 10:15.532
- Yay, Graham.
- Thank you.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.451
- Okay, let's hug outside.
- Yes, let's do that.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.786
- Wanna see the Nativity?
- Oh, good. Take a gander at that.

10:19.786 --> 10:22.748
- And I'll go to the kitchen.
- Oh, I'm starving. I'm so hungry.

10:22.748 --> 10:24.750
Yes, yes, yes.
Oh, please, sandwiches.

10:24.750 --> 10:28.420
Did Ali send cookies?
She sent cookies? What are you doing?

10:28.420 --> 10:31.006
Well, I found all of these
in the back clo-- shit!

10:42.142 --> 10:45.145
Is that Ali?

10:45.145 --> 10:46.229
Shut up.

10:48.398 --> 10:50.484
Well, I thought--
I thought you said he was working.

10:50.484 --> 10:51.610
He said he was working!

10:51.610 --> 10:53.737
When has he ever said that
and then shown up somewhere?

10:53.737 --> 10:55.155
What are you doing here?

10:55.155 --> 10:57.032
I-- I was invited.

10:57.032 --> 10:58.367
No, no.

10:58.367 --> 11:00.994
I'm pretty sure when you
uninvited me from your life,

11:00.994 --> 11:03.288
you uninvited you from Christmas!

11:03.288 --> 11:05.374
Graham, that's not really true.

11:05.374 --> 11:07.793
We knew she'd be alone
for Christmas, so we invited her.

11:07.793 --> 11:09.669
I'm sorry. How did you know that?

11:09.669 --> 11:10.754
Well...

11:12.422 --> 11:13.757
- We keep in touch.
-  Yeah.

11:13.757 --> 11:16.468
- You keep in touch?
- We keep in touch, yes.

11:16.468 --> 11:19.429
We text. Uh, she posted
that she was on vacation.

11:19.429 --> 11:21.723
I swiped up, and, you know,
next thing you know we're DM-ing.

11:21.723 --> 11:23.350
- Then texting--
- Texting and...

11:23.350 --> 11:26.061
And now we're on day
75 of Wordle.

11:26.061 --> 11:28.063
...of Wordle,
and you're, like, incredible.

11:28.063 --> 11:30.065
- No.
- Last night you got it in like two tries?

11:30.065 --> 11:31.149
What was the word?

11:31.149 --> 11:32.859
Death!

11:32.859 --> 11:34.861
Cool. Oh, my God, that's so wild.

11:34.861 --> 11:35.946
- Text and--
-  Why?

11:35.946 --> 11:39.408
Graham, Ali has been a part
of our family for a very long time.

11:39.408 --> 11:42.244
You can't just flip that off
like a light switch.

11:42.244 --> 11:44.162
That's literally what she did to me.

11:44.162 --> 11:47.499
Okay, you know what, actually--
I think it's time to get my ring back.

11:47.499 --> 11:50.335
Oh, the ring. My ring?
The one you gave me.

11:50.335 --> 11:53.255
Well, I thought about it,
and I like it too much, okay?

11:53.255 --> 11:57.134
It's very pretty on the hand.
And also, I didn't want to hurt you.

11:57.134 --> 12:00.137
Why didn't you just say,
"Hey, Graham, let's talk about things.

12:00.137 --> 12:01.847
Let's try and work through this."

12:01.847 --> 12:06.101
I literally said so many times,
"Hey, we need to talk."

12:06.101 --> 12:08.103
- Pffft.
-"We need to work on things."

12:08.103 --> 12:13.275
But you never processed it,
Mr. Lack of Self-Awareness!

12:13.275 --> 12:17.821
Oh, I am like a wolf in the jungle, okay?
I'm always aware.

12:17.821 --> 12:20.073
- Okay, I'd hit that.
- What?

12:20.073 --> 12:21.825
I said I would hit that.

12:22.325 --> 12:24.953
-  Uh-huh.
- No. Do you know what that means?

12:24.953 --> 12:27.330
Putting an end to something.
I'm putting an end to this conversation.

12:27.330 --> 12:29.833
No, that's not what it means.
Have you been saying this to people?

12:29.833 --> 12:32.544
I said it yesterday to the pharmacist.
What does it mean?

12:32.544 --> 12:35.380
You guys can talk about what it means
when I'm very, very far from here.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.340
-  What does it--
-  And right now, everyone...

12:37.340 --> 12:41.595
everyone needs to understand
Ali and I are over.

12:41.595 --> 12:44.055
So, you know what?
This is super unfair.

12:44.055 --> 12:45.474
She broke up with me.

12:45.474 --> 12:47.934
But I'll go. Merry Christmas.

12:50.395 --> 12:51.521
I should go?

12:52.606 --> 12:54.357
I don't wanna. Okay, fine, I'll go.

13:02.741 --> 13:04.784
Hey, isn't that baby Jesus's job?

13:07.454 --> 13:09.498
Just don't break anything
'cause Mom's gonna be so mad.

13:09.498 --> 13:12.417
You guys plan on telling me about this
or just keep it a secret forever?

13:12.417 --> 13:14.503
Can you blame us?
You're kind of freaking out!

13:14.503 --> 13:16.796
Of course I'm freaking out.
Wouldn't you be?

13:17.422 --> 13:19.341
- So, what do you wanna do?
- I dunno.

13:19.341 --> 13:22.928
Literally every hotel in town is booked,
even the Holiday Inn.

13:22.928 --> 13:25.555
Yeah. Maybe you could stay
in a manger.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.725
-  Ha ha.

13:28.725 --> 13:31.686
Everybody is so hilarious today.

13:40.779 --> 13:42.239
I'm gonna fly home.

13:42.239 --> 13:46.159
I love you, but you have your head
so far up your own butt

13:46.159 --> 13:48.370
that you can basically
lick your own tonsils.

13:48.370 --> 13:49.871
Ew, what?

13:49.871 --> 13:52.749
Okay. How do you
expect me to react, hmm?

13:52.749 --> 13:56.294
You invited
my ex-fiancée to Christmas!

13:56.294 --> 13:58.463
- Technically, Mom invited her.
- Oh, that's fine, then.

13:58.463 --> 14:00.340
But I get it, I get it. It's weird.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.384
No, actually, you don't get it.

14:04.844 --> 14:09.140
You know, Ali never gave me
one real reason why she dumped me.

14:09.140 --> 14:10.225
Not one.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.650
She didn't say anything to you,
did she?

14:18.650 --> 14:20.443
No, we didn't really talk
about that stuff.

14:20.443 --> 14:23.029
And every time Ali was here,
you were off in your own little world.

14:24.072 --> 14:26.783
- What does that mean?
- Grandma's 90th?

14:28.326 --> 14:30.412
- Well, it's not a hundred.
- Well, she showed up.

14:30.412 --> 14:33.456
Also, when Heather and I
got our place, who helped us move?

14:33.456 --> 14:35.208
I offered to pay for movers.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.669
And... moving sucks!

14:37.669 --> 14:39.754
I know it does, which is why
I needed your help.

14:42.299 --> 14:46.595
I dunno, I think Mom's gonna
invite Ali to a lot of holidays now.

14:46.595 --> 14:48.680
Like Cinco de Ali.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.015
Could you imagine?

14:50.015 --> 14:54.436
Or, um... Easter Ali Day.

14:55.145 --> 14:56.313
- No.
- That wasn't great.

14:56.313 --> 14:58.148
- Ali-ween!
- Oh, God.

14:58.148 --> 15:01.860
Ali Fool's. Ali Fool's
is the--that was-- also fine.

15:01.860 --> 15:05.030
Okay, look, I know you're joking,
but you're not wrong.

15:05.030 --> 15:08.825
Mom and Dad are so sweet
and so naïve, they can't move on.

15:09.743 --> 15:11.411
No. No, which is why
you and Ali need to--

15:11.411 --> 15:14.414
I need to show them how evil she is.

15:14.414 --> 15:15.707
- No.
- Yes!

15:15.707 --> 15:17.500
That's not what I was gonna say.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.127
You're a genius, okay?
I know what I have to do.

15:19.127 --> 15:21.838
I have to get Mom and Dad
to dump Ali before Christmas.

15:21.838 --> 15:25.592
Otherwise, I'm gonna have
to share my family forever.

15:25.592 --> 15:28.511
Okay. I'm gonna pretend like you're
not going absolutely insane right now.

15:28.511 --> 15:31.598
- Can we please go inside?
- We have to go inside, okay?

15:31.598 --> 15:34.059
'Cause every second she's in there is
another chance for her to steal my family.

15:34.059 --> 15:36.728
What are we still doing here?
We got to save Christmas, come on!

15:38.938 --> 15:39.939
- Oh, my God.
- Mind!

15:39.939 --> 15:41.149
- I'm coming.
- Move it!

15:41.149 --> 15:43.818
Oh, my God. I'm scared.

15:48.198 --> 15:50.575
Well, I mean, my Dad
and his new girlfriend

15:50.575 --> 15:54.120
did technically invite me
to join them in Hawaii.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.956
Well, it doesn't sound like
you're too fond of his new girlfriend.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.958
Well, I don't really know
the new girlfriend.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.044
I mean,
there's one every, like, two weeks.

16:01.044 --> 16:05.507
And it's always someone named
Bunny or Cookie or Maple Syrup.

16:05.507 --> 16:07.676
Uh, they all sound sweet and sticky.

16:07.676 --> 16:10.470
His good taste started
and ended with my mother.

16:10.470 --> 16:13.264
Oh, honey.
I know how much you miss her.

16:13.264 --> 16:17.310
But you always have a place here.
You're part of our family, you know it.

16:19.354 --> 16:21.189
-  Mom?
- Well, well.

16:21.189 --> 16:23.942
Has my son finally come to his senses?

16:23.942 --> 16:25.026
Well, Mom...

16:25.026 --> 16:28.029
I will admit I may not have handled

16:28.029 --> 16:31.616
this whole situation
as well as I could have.

16:31.616 --> 16:34.160
But then I realized it's Christmas,

16:34.160 --> 16:38.373
and there is more than enough
holiday spirit to go around.

16:38.373 --> 16:40.875
Well,
that is wonderful to hear.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.043
Mm-hmm.

16:42.043 --> 16:45.714
Wow, that's-- that's
really big of you, Graham.

16:45.714 --> 16:46.798
Hello!

16:46.798 --> 16:49.300
Look at this old vagrant
I picked up from grad school!

16:49.300 --> 16:50.385
God, Dad.

16:50.385 --> 16:52.721
"Vagrant" is a derogatory term
blaming the unhoused for their own situ--

16:52.721 --> 16:55.724
- Sweet baby of Bethlehem!
- Okay, whatever.

16:55.724 --> 16:59.060
Did I have too much nog at the office,
or is this my firstborn standing there?

16:59.060 --> 17:00.145
Surprise!

17:00.145 --> 17:02.105
Oh, hey, buddy.

17:02.105 --> 17:04.816
Elliot! Oh! How'd the Psych final go?

17:04.816 --> 17:06.192
-"A"-minus!
-  What?

17:06.192 --> 17:09.237
I couldn't have done it without you
and all the FaceTime study sessions, Ali.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.740
- FaceTime study sessions.
- Yes. Aww. Congratulations.

17:11.740 --> 17:14.159
That's such a nice moment
between you guys.

17:14.159 --> 17:16.995
I mean, it wasn't an "A," so.

17:16.995 --> 17:18.747
I'm so glad that you two
finally patched things up!

17:18.747 --> 17:21.458
- Oh, no. We didn't patch any--
- No, it's just a temporary patching--

17:21.458 --> 17:22.959
It's a try-not-to-
kill-each-other sort of thing.

17:22.959 --> 17:25.462
Okay. Well, then,
I'm sorry that I said anything.

17:25.462 --> 17:28.757
But it's great that you're here.
Hey, what about all your work?

17:28.757 --> 17:30.675
Oh, no, no.
I still have to do all of that.

17:30.675 --> 17:32.427
Yeah. I'm on a deadline.

17:32.427 --> 17:33.595
But...

17:33.595 --> 17:37.515
I also realized that
a Stroop family Christmas

17:37.515 --> 17:40.435
wouldn't be the same
without all of the Stroop kids, so.

17:40.435 --> 17:42.187
Oh, yay. It looks like we're having

17:42.187 --> 17:45.064
an honest-to-goodness
Stroop family Christmas.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.191
Let's make reindeer food!

17:46.191 --> 17:47.650
Oh, I'll grab the Christmas vinyl!

17:47.650 --> 17:49.778
-  I got the wine!
-  I love it.

17:52.280 --> 17:53.406
- Graham!
- Yeah?

17:53.406 --> 17:54.365
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:54.365 --> 17:57.619
I just wanted to say that, um...

17:57.619 --> 17:59.287
I would never have come here

17:59.287 --> 18:01.623
if your parents hadn't sworn
you'd be in L.A.

18:01.623 --> 18:05.418
But now that we are here, together...

18:06.711 --> 18:09.714
uh, do you wanna maybe talk about it?

18:09.714 --> 18:13.259
- Talk about what?
- Our separation.

18:13.259 --> 18:14.803
Oh, that.

18:14.803 --> 18:17.555
No, thank you.

18:18.139 --> 18:19.307
Graham?

18:20.225 --> 18:22.852
You didn't want to talk about it then.
I don't wanna talk about it now.

18:22.852 --> 18:25.438
So... let's just not talk about it.

18:26.648 --> 18:27.649
Are you sure?

18:27.649 --> 18:31.569
Ali, we're both grownups here,
so let's just act like grownups.

18:31.569 --> 18:32.779
- Hey, Graham?
- Yeah?

18:32.779 --> 18:34.656
Which couch do you want me
to set up for you?

18:34.656 --> 18:36.741
The one in the basement
is more comfortable,

18:36.741 --> 18:39.869
but the new one in the game room
doesn't smell like cat pee.

18:39.869 --> 18:41.454
RIP, Mister Cinnamon.

18:41.454 --> 18:44.749
Yeah, so that means that Ali was,
uh, set up in my room?

18:44.749 --> 18:45.708
You know what? I'm gonna just move--

18:45.708 --> 18:46.668
Yeah, because she was here.

18:46.668 --> 18:48.044
Because Pamela Anderson
and Wolverine

18:48.044 --> 18:50.004
staring at me
from the wall's kinda creepy.

18:50.004 --> 18:51.464
No, no, no, no.

18:51.464 --> 18:54.717
Joseph would never let Mary
sleep on the couch, right?

18:54.717 --> 18:56.469
That's the man I raised.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.638
Yeah. The clean couch, please.

18:58.638 --> 18:59.931
- You got it.
- Thank you.

19:02.267 --> 19:03.643
- Graham...
- Yes?

19:03.643 --> 19:04.853
What's going on?

19:04.853 --> 19:09.357
I know you,
and you're acting... weird.

19:09.357 --> 19:10.859
I'm fine.

19:10.859 --> 19:13.111
In fact, I'm super.

19:13.111 --> 19:16.698
Hey, fam! How do we feel
about a game night tonight?

19:16.698 --> 19:18.658
- Did somebody mention a game night?
- You bet.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.994
Okay, well, I got the supplies.

19:20.994 --> 19:23.288
Whoo-hoo-hoo,
gonna need more than that.

19:23.746 --> 19:24.956
Who's hungry,
what can I make ya?

19:24.956 --> 19:27.917
-  Yes!
- I am. Starving.

19:27.917 --> 19:32.630
<i>♪ Everybody's singin',
laughin' up and down the way ♪</i>

19:35.717 --> 19:41.055
<i>♪ Goin' all around
for a jolly, jolly day ♪</i>

19:49.397 --> 19:51.107
<i>♪ Everybody's boppin' ♪</i>

19:51.107 --> 19:53.109
Coming in hot.

19:53.109 --> 19:55.653
Quip.
'Cause I'm full of quips, baby.

19:55.653 --> 19:57.822
-  Good for you, baby.
- Let's go.

19:57.822 --> 19:59.741
Whoo-hoo! That was my "Q."

19:59.741 --> 20:01.451
Do you know how hard it is
to get rid of a "Q"?

20:01.451 --> 20:04.120
I know, and when you
have a "U" and an "I,"

20:04.120 --> 20:09.417
and then every other letter
on your board to create an entire word--

20:09.417 --> 20:13.588
"Quilting," using each and every
one of my letters. It's empty.

20:13.588 --> 20:14.839
-  Empty slate.

20:14.839 --> 20:17.091
- Uh, no, no, no. Challenge, challenge.
-  Here I go.

20:17.091 --> 20:18.593
You misspelled "quitting,"

20:18.593 --> 20:20.720
which is surprising
'cause you're really good at it.

20:20.720 --> 20:24.057
True, it's no "cat"
for seven points, but it is--

20:24.057 --> 20:25.892
I had no letters, 'kay?

20:25.892 --> 20:29.103
- Whoo, 96 points!
-  Good for you, Ali.

20:29.103 --> 20:32.857
- Wow. Everyone cheer for Ali.
-  Fun! Good for you.

20:32.857 --> 20:35.610
- Yay, Ali! Cheers!

20:35.610 --> 20:37.445
-  I was--
- To Ali. I'm glad you're here, Ali.

20:37.445 --> 20:40.406
I was joking.
All right, let's play another game.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.533
-  Ooh. Let's play Werewolf.
-  Yes!

20:42.533 --> 20:44.077
Let's play!

20:44.577 --> 20:47.246
Look at her. She's playing you.

20:47.246 --> 20:50.083
- She's been picking off our family...

20:50.083 --> 20:52.335
- ...one by one. Okay?
- Oh, my God.

20:52.335 --> 20:55.213
She's the werewolf.
I'm a villager, I swear.

20:56.047 --> 20:58.841
Eh-- Of course, you'd say
your ex is the monster.

20:58.841 --> 21:00.593
I mean, I know you guys
don't wanna see it, but like--

21:00.593 --> 21:02.679
he's obviously the werewolf.

21:02.679 --> 21:04.472
Villager. This is a villager outfit.

21:04.472 --> 21:06.975
Okay? This is not a werewolf outfit.
This is the werewolf.

21:06.975 --> 21:10.979
Please, I know you don't
wanna see it, but your son,

21:10.979 --> 21:13.106
your precious firstborn,

21:13.106 --> 21:15.525
he is... the werewolf.

21:16.359 --> 21:18.444
-  Okay. Okay.
-  Believe me. I swear.

21:19.696 --> 21:21.614
Look me in the eye

21:21.614 --> 21:24.993
and swear to me
that you're a villager.

21:25.743 --> 21:27.829
I swear...

21:29.080 --> 21:32.041
on the spirit of Christmas...

21:33.918 --> 21:36.170
that I am just a villager.

21:37.880 --> 21:40.258
-  Wow.
-  That's very convincing.

21:40.258 --> 21:41.592
-  Very convincing.
-  All righty.

21:41.592 --> 21:43.011
I can't compete with that.

21:44.554 --> 21:48.099
-  Time is up.
-  Werewolf!

21:49.809 --> 21:52.520
Werewolf! Werewolf!

21:52.520 --> 21:53.646
Villager.

21:53.646 --> 21:55.648
Oh, my God!

21:55.648 --> 21:58.776
You guys bought it.

21:58.776 --> 22:02.864
Whoa! I'm so sorry.
All you were fooled.

22:02.864 --> 22:05.283
Especially you. So gullible!

22:05.283 --> 22:08.870
I am the werewolf.
How about that?

22:10.872 --> 22:14.292
Whoo! Ahh! Feels good.

22:14.292 --> 22:16.753
But you swore
on the spirit of Christmas.

22:16.753 --> 22:17.837
Yeah. Too far.

22:18.379 --> 22:19.964
Well, I just--

22:19.964 --> 22:21.674
Well, I didn't it mean it like that.

22:22.759 --> 22:25.261
I didn't mean it like-- for real.

22:25.261 --> 22:27.346
I think I'm done with game night.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.431
- No!
- Me, too.

22:28.431 --> 22:29.515
Oh.

22:29.515 --> 22:30.892
Get you picked up here.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.270
That was super fun, everybody.

22:34.270 --> 22:37.190
Just because
of that horrible thing Ali said?

22:37.190 --> 22:38.691
The object of the game is to...

22:38.691 --> 22:39.942
You wanna watch
a movie or something?

22:39.942 --> 22:41.235
Thanks, guys.

22:41.736 --> 22:43.446
Do you have anything in mind?

22:43.446 --> 22:44.530
I don't know.

22:44.530 --> 22:46.741
Well, that was
really horrible what she said.

22:46.741 --> 22:49.994
Oh, boy. You know, I had
a feeling your competitive spirit

22:49.994 --> 22:52.830
might get you into a little bit
of trouble with the Stroop fam.

22:54.665 --> 22:58.586
I see. You're trying
to make me look bad.

22:58.586 --> 23:00.046
I didn't even have to try.

23:01.130 --> 23:02.799
My family will work up the courage

23:02.799 --> 23:06.052
to ask you to leave
before Christmas morning.

23:08.137 --> 23:10.765
You wanna-- you wanna bet?

23:10.765 --> 23:13.976
Oh. [scoffs] Yeah. It's a bet.

23:13.976 --> 23:16.854
By Christmas morning, you're gone.

23:18.189 --> 23:19.649
Or you're gone. Hmm.

23:19.649 --> 23:20.775
Only one can stay.

23:20.775 --> 23:24.028
And that goes
for every holiday forever.

23:25.696 --> 23:26.781
- Great.
- Great.

23:26.781 --> 23:28.574
- We're on.
- We're on.

23:29.742 --> 23:33.371
<i>...control tonight, they are
showing this Calgary team how it's done.</i>

23:33.371 --> 23:36.207
<i>And here we go.
Anderson's coming up the corner there.</i>

23:36.207 --> 23:38.709
<i>He has the puck.
Over to Sam Hoesley.</i>

23:38.709 --> 23:40.962
<i>Oh, my gosh.
He shoots. He scores!</i>

23:45.216 --> 23:47.468
Yeah, baby.

23:47.468 --> 23:49.220
- Yes. Okay, okay, okay.
- That's crazy.

23:49.220 --> 23:50.972
Gosh. Okay. French toast
is almost ready, everybody.

23:50.972 --> 23:52.682
Unless you want something else,
I can make it for you.

23:52.682 --> 23:54.225
How about some
blueberry pancakes?

23:54.225 --> 23:56.853
- Well, I've got French toast.
- But everybody likes your blueberry--

23:56.853 --> 23:59.230
Yes, they do. I can make you some--
Honey, are you up?

23:59.230 --> 24:00.648
- I am now.
- Morning, Graham.

24:00.648 --> 24:02.775
- I'll help you after the commercial.
- Yeah. Yeah.

24:02.775 --> 24:05.403
Thank you for coming
to join me on my bed.

24:05.403 --> 24:07.155
Okay. Let's keep it down.
He's trying to sleep.

24:07.155 --> 24:09.740
Oh, yeah. Now's a good time
to keep it down. I gotta pee.

24:09.740 --> 24:11.159
- You want coffee?

24:11.159 --> 24:12.660
There you go. All right.

24:12.660 --> 24:14.370
Yes, please.

24:23.796 --> 24:26.090
Ali, I gotta go.

24:29.343 --> 24:30.386
Come on.

24:30.386 --> 24:32.805
Your hair looks as good
as it's gonna look.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.849
- Come on.

24:34.849 --> 24:38.102
Hurry up.
Come on. Let's go.

24:39.187 --> 24:40.396
Ali.

24:41.522 --> 24:43.733
Sounds like an emergency.

24:43.733 --> 24:46.611
- Very funny.
- Coming.

24:46.611 --> 24:50.907
Gotta go. Gotta go. Gotta--

24:50.907 --> 24:53.826
- There you are. Thank you so much.
- It's all yours.

24:58.080 --> 25:00.291
Sweetheart.
Is Heather not coming for sure?

25:00.291 --> 25:02.668
I've got her veggie bacon.
Nobody else eats it.

25:02.668 --> 25:04.128
No, I told you, she's doing
Christmas with her family.

25:04.128 --> 25:06.130
I feel like it's because
I didn't ask her myself.

25:06.130 --> 25:08.466
- No. That's not why.
- I didn't ask her. That was wrong.

25:08.466 --> 25:09.675
No, no, no. She says hi.
And she misses us--

25:09.675 --> 25:11.719
You know what?
I'm gonna give her a call.

25:11.719 --> 25:13.095
- Please don't. Don't call her.
- No, I think that would work.

25:13.095 --> 25:14.388
- No, no, no.
- Everybody likes to get a call.

25:26.275 --> 25:30.780
No, no, no, no, no. God!
Where's the plunger?

25:30.780 --> 25:34.283
Code red! Code red! Code red!
Code red! Get the towels!

25:34.283 --> 25:35.368
-  What?
-  I'll get the mop.

25:38.329 --> 25:40.331
Okay. Nobody panic.
I'll get the towels.

25:40.331 --> 25:42.124
I'll get the towels. I'll get the towels.
Oh, I'll get the towels. Nobody panic.

25:42.124 --> 25:44.126
Did you not read the sign?

25:45.461 --> 25:48.673
Didn't anyone read the sign?
Why didn't you read the sign?

25:48.673 --> 25:50.716
There was no sign.

25:50.716 --> 25:51.926
Get the towels! Save the carpet!

25:51.926 --> 25:54.178
That's a big puddle.
Oh, my God.

25:54.178 --> 25:55.721
Don't let it out of the bathroom!

25:55.721 --> 25:57.348
You're doing great, Dad.
You're doing great.

25:57.348 --> 25:59.350
- Can you stop filming and help us!
- Stop filming!

25:59.350 --> 26:00.643
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

26:00.643 --> 26:03.229
I'm gonna cram it up your ass!
Get over here and plunge!

26:03.229 --> 26:05.356
- Oh! My socks! It's getting wet!
- That was disgusting!

26:05.356 --> 26:07.650
Don't worry about your socks.
Save the carpet!

26:07.650 --> 26:09.485
Oh, God. So much water!

26:09.485 --> 26:12.613
- We need a plunger!
- I got it! I got it!

26:18.160 --> 26:19.412
We're clear!

26:22.498 --> 26:24.917
Thank you, Ali.
You are our hero.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.254
- Mom?
- Jeannie!

26:29.463 --> 26:31.132
Someone stole the baby Jesus.

26:33.259 --> 26:36.137
-  Jeannie!

26:36.137 --> 26:37.513
- Mom!
- Jeannie?

26:37.513 --> 26:39.307
Mom, are you okay?

26:39.307 --> 26:42.977
Look! Someone stole the baby Jesus!

26:42.977 --> 26:45.313
Oh, Mom.
My God, we thought you were hurt.

26:45.313 --> 26:48.607
I am hurt. My heart
is being torn out of my chest.

26:48.607 --> 26:52.320
I've had that baby Jesus
since before you were born.

26:52.320 --> 26:53.696
Who would do such an awful thing?

26:53.696 --> 26:56.532
I dunno. Probably
just some teenagers, Mom.

26:56.532 --> 26:59.744
Or... or somebody new here

26:59.744 --> 27:01.996
who hates to see our family happy.

27:01.996 --> 27:03.664
- Hmm.
- What?

27:03.664 --> 27:06.459
Graham, you're obviously talking
about Ali. Ali is not new here.

27:06.459 --> 27:09.337
She's been with us for five years.
She's not gonna steal the baby Jesus.

27:09.337 --> 27:10.588
- I didn't say anything.
-  You know what?

27:10.588 --> 27:14.300
I can go get one. Yeah, I'll pick one up
from the store, put it in place,

27:14.300 --> 27:16.010
and meet you guys
back at the lot, okay?

27:16.010 --> 27:19.680
- Oh, Ali.
-  Oh. You're the best, Ali.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.432
You're a Christmas angel.
You're saving the day.

27:21.432 --> 27:22.516
Thank you. Thank you.

27:22.516 --> 27:24.268
Oh, no. I'll go, Mom.

27:24.268 --> 27:27.396
I'll-- I'll save the day. She won't
know which one to get anyways, so.

27:27.396 --> 27:29.440
- I think I can manage.
- She can't.

27:29.440 --> 27:31.442
I know how to go to a store and shop.

27:31.442 --> 27:34.153
I have maternal instincts
and ovaries, and...

27:34.153 --> 27:35.237
We haven't seen them.

27:35.237 --> 27:38.449
And I know what babies look like.
I don't know that he knows--

27:38.449 --> 27:41.202
I'll go without ovaries.
I'll pick the perfect baby Jesus.

27:41.202 --> 27:42.995
Oh, for God's sake,
just both of you go. Here.

27:43.913 --> 27:46.582
Oh. There's a key in here somewhere.

27:46.582 --> 27:47.750
- That's right.
- Okay.

27:47.750 --> 27:49.960
- Have fun.
- Yeah, right.

27:50.586 --> 27:52.046
Christmas crisis averted.

27:52.046 --> 27:53.964
Well, that's one off the list, anyway.

27:53.964 --> 27:55.674
I have a list, Dennis.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.761
This is fine.
We look normal, just act normal.

27:58.761 --> 28:01.389
We look great, okay?
You look-- actually that looks nice.

28:01.389 --> 28:04.558
You're doing-- that was
a compliment. What are you--

28:04.558 --> 28:06.602
- It's fine. What?

28:08.521 --> 28:11.816
So, does it have to be total war
between us this entire holiday?

28:11.816 --> 28:15.236
Uh-- you know, I am tempted
to say no, but...

28:15.236 --> 28:17.029
hmm... yeah, probably.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.531
You never supported me.
Why should I support you now?

28:18.531 --> 28:20.991
- What is that supposed to mean?
-  What is that supposed to mean?

28:20.991 --> 28:22.076
Real mature.

28:22.076 --> 28:24.745
Oh, okay, you're here trying
to steal my family. That's pretty mature.

28:24.745 --> 28:28.165
I'm not trying to steal your family.
You don't even like your family.

28:28.165 --> 28:29.250
I-- what?

28:29.250 --> 28:33.045
You're dismissive of your family
and dismissive of me. And my feelings.

28:33.045 --> 28:35.840
Wow. Well, I'm gonna
dismiss that comment, okay?

28:35.840 --> 28:39.093
And you can leave
and surrender any time you want.

28:39.635 --> 28:41.971
- Never. Hmm.
- Never. Okay.

28:41.971 --> 28:44.849
- What is going on here? Is this it?
- Well, I think this is it.

28:44.849 --> 28:47.768
We've arrived at our options.
This is, uh...

28:47.768 --> 28:49.645
- Yikes.
- Rubber ducky Jesus.

28:49.645 --> 28:51.856
- Is this all right for a manger?
- This is sad.

28:51.856 --> 28:53.858
This is the bottom--

28:53.858 --> 28:58.904
the absolute bottom
of the Nativity barrel.

28:58.904 --> 29:00.448
Is that even a thing for sale?

29:00.448 --> 29:02.366
Or did someone just make it
and put it in the bin?

29:03.617 --> 29:06.245
It might win.
I got Tyrannosaurus Jesus.

29:06.245 --> 29:09.582
Oh, this is quiet an ironic way
to teach creationism.

29:09.582 --> 29:12.626
Oh, don't bring that up
with Jeannie, okay? Just--

29:12.626 --> 29:13.794
- Oh, no, I'm bringing it up.
- Don't bring it up.

29:13.794 --> 29:15.713
- These little arms--
- She will kick you clean--

29:15.713 --> 29:18.340
You know what, bring it up with her.
Talk to her about it, see what happens.

29:18.340 --> 29:19.550
- Ohh, hmm.
- Okay?

29:19.550 --> 29:22.386
This is big 'cause it cries.
It belongs in the manger.

29:23.345 --> 29:24.680
That's generous.
That is not a baby.

29:24.680 --> 29:25.890
I don't know,
he's got a little diaper.

29:25.890 --> 29:27.558
Just 'cause he's--
That's his robe!

29:27.558 --> 29:29.268
And he makes a baby sound, listen.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.731
Wah! Can you believe that?
What about you?

29:33.731 --> 29:36.317
- All right. Make this guy roar.

29:36.317 --> 29:38.360
Very nice.

29:41.155 --> 29:42.907
I gotta take this, hold on.

29:42.907 --> 29:47.119
Hello. Hey, Mr. Tusk, yes?

29:47.119 --> 29:48.579
I know.

29:49.163 --> 29:50.956
Christmas Day, I know.

29:50.956 --> 29:52.333
Coming up fast. Yes, sir.

29:52.333 --> 29:55.336
I'm on it, okay?

29:55.336 --> 29:58.631
I will take care of it right away.
Okay. Okay, bye.

30:01.383 --> 30:03.427
Ready?

30:04.428 --> 30:05.429
Okay, let's go.

30:06.597 --> 30:07.765
Been ready.

30:09.433 --> 30:12.811
- I'll hold them.
-  I'll hold them.

30:19.235 --> 30:21.362
Well, Graham said it was slim pickings.

30:21.362 --> 30:24.573
It's all they had left.
Now, it looks like a little T-rex...

30:24.573 --> 30:26.659
- Uh-huh.
- ...who won a pageant.

30:26.659 --> 30:29.078
There's nothing
baby Jesus about it at all.

30:29.078 --> 30:31.705
- Well, it'll work for now.
- Yeah.

30:32.957 --> 30:35.376
Oh. Oh, we're in trouble.

30:35.376 --> 30:37.253
Yeah. We're gonna burn in hell.

30:37.836 --> 30:40.339
Okay. Let's go get ready for that party.

30:51.475 --> 30:54.061
Wow, I kinda forgot
how big this thing is.

30:54.061 --> 30:57.147
Oh, yeah. It is the social event
of the holiday season.

30:57.147 --> 30:58.857
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

31:01.443 --> 31:02.444
Oh, no.

31:04.738 --> 31:06.574
-  What?
- Oh, no.

31:10.828 --> 31:13.163
- D-d-- nothing. Shut up.
- Oh. What?

31:13.163 --> 31:14.248
Shh!

31:14.248 --> 31:17.209
I almost forgot about
your irrational hatred of goats.

31:19.295 --> 31:21.589
- Hey, Santa!
- Ohh!

31:21.589 --> 31:23.090
- Place looks great.

31:23.090 --> 31:25.676
You're gonna move
a ton of inventory this season!

31:25.676 --> 31:28.053
Oh, I hope so.
We got two mortgages on the house.

31:28.053 --> 31:30.055
- Oh, boy.
- But why the goat?

31:30.055 --> 31:33.642
Well, we had to change things up
after last year's fiasco with the bunnies.

31:33.642 --> 31:35.436
But they were so cute.

31:35.436 --> 31:38.606
Yeah, they were cute, but now there's
like 300 of them living in the park.

31:38.606 --> 31:39.690
What's wrong with goats?

31:39.690 --> 31:42.151
She has an irrational fear
after one of 'em headbutted her

31:42.151 --> 31:43.902
when she was a kid.
She thinks they're all evil.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.405
They have rectangular pupils, Dennis.

31:46.405 --> 31:47.698
You know what, forget about the goat.

31:47.698 --> 31:50.534
Why don't you say hi to the team.
Hey, Brady!

31:54.038 --> 31:55.080
Graham!

31:56.665 --> 31:58.375
It's been a while, man!

31:58.375 --> 32:00.044
Yeah. Yeah, been a while.

32:00.044 --> 32:02.463
Who is this beauty by your side?

32:02.463 --> 32:04.465
Oh, Dennis, you know him.
He's your boss.

32:05.174 --> 32:07.760
- Hi. Uh, I'm Ali. Mayer.
- Hi.

32:07.760 --> 32:11.138
Uh, I'm not by his side.
He's-- he's my...

32:11.138 --> 32:12.556
- Ex-fiancé.
- Ex.

32:13.098 --> 32:15.684
Wow, Graham. You let her go?
That was a big mistake.

32:15.684 --> 32:19.688
No, no, no, no. Her mistake, actually.
Yeah, she let me go, so...

32:22.524 --> 32:23.817
Well, we didn't mean to interrupt you.

32:23.817 --> 32:25.736
I know you were telling a story
to your friends there.

32:25.736 --> 32:28.072
No, no, no, no.
I've lost my train of thought.

32:28.072 --> 32:30.866
Yeah. Well, talking's confusing.

32:30.866 --> 32:33.327
Uh, anyway,
back to selling cars, I guess.

32:33.327 --> 32:37.289
Okay. Well, wow. I think you're
just being a little bit frosty here

32:37.289 --> 32:39.375
because you were offered a job here.

32:39.375 --> 32:42.378
You didn't take it. Brady got it.
Now he's head salesman.

32:42.378 --> 32:45.255
- Number one.
- Smells like number two.

32:45.255 --> 32:48.300
Mmm, and who could forget
when Brady beat out Graham

32:48.300 --> 32:50.844
for captain of the hockey team
in 12th grade?

32:50.844 --> 32:52.471
And we won state that year.

32:52.471 --> 32:54.682
Oh. Yes, you did.

32:54.682 --> 32:58.143
Oh, and in 9th grade you both wanted
to play the scarecrow in <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>.

32:58.143 --> 33:01.271
You got it, and you played
the Mayor of Munchkinland.

33:01.271 --> 33:04.233
But you were so good.
He was a lot smaller back then.

33:04.233 --> 33:05.526
Yeah. This has been so fun.

33:05.526 --> 33:08.529
You know what, I am going
to go hang with the baby demon.

33:08.529 --> 33:10.030
I'm gonna get back
to selling some cars.

33:11.782 --> 33:13.784
You guys tried the eggnog?
It's really good.

33:13.784 --> 33:16.495
- Spicy.
- So, Ali, are you, uh--?

33:16.495 --> 33:19.707
So, okay, you're still doing that-- Okay.
Hey, you two have fun.

33:19.707 --> 33:22.501
- Can I interest you in a ride?
-  Good one, Brady.

33:22.501 --> 33:24.378
- The ride of your life?
- Um...

33:29.883 --> 33:32.845
There you go. Hey, you're pretty cute.

33:32.845 --> 33:34.763
Little bigger than I thought.

33:34.763 --> 33:37.015
This party sucks.

33:38.434 --> 33:40.018
I couldn't agree more.

33:42.855 --> 33:43.856
I'm Graham.

33:43.856 --> 33:45.190
I know, I'm Jess.

33:45.983 --> 33:46.984
What do you mean you know?

33:46.984 --> 33:48.485
We actually went to school together.

33:48.485 --> 33:51.572
I was a few grades below you.
You played hockey with Brady.

33:51.572 --> 33:53.657
- Uh-huh.
- You should've been captain that year.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.952
Thank you. Thank you.

33:56.952 --> 34:00.622
That is the nicest thing anyone's
said to me in a long time.

34:06.378 --> 34:09.298
- Do you want a drink?
- Lead the way.

34:10.299 --> 34:11.592
Oh, one second.

34:16.472 --> 34:17.723
Okay, let's go.

34:18.891 --> 34:20.559
Thank you so much
for all coming out today.

34:20.559 --> 34:22.936
The reason for the season
of course is love.

34:22.936 --> 34:24.772
- Love.
- That's exactly right.

34:24.772 --> 34:29.943
But it is also the time for a good deal
with a fair price on automobiles.

34:29.943 --> 34:32.863
And just because they're used
doesn't mean they're bad.

34:32.863 --> 34:35.157
- It's like me.

34:35.157 --> 34:36.450
Jeannie just does everything.

34:36.450 --> 34:39.244
You know, she painted the windows here.
Took her two weeks.

34:39.244 --> 34:41.246
I-- I said,
"Can we hire someone?"

34:41.246 --> 34:43.832
"No, they like the way
you do it, Jeannie."

34:45.459 --> 34:46.543
We really can't afford it.

34:46.543 --> 34:49.254
Jeannie is my own personal Santa Claus.

34:49.254 --> 34:51.173
And of course, nothing runs without her.

34:51.173 --> 34:52.424
Yeah, Mom!

34:53.383 --> 34:56.011
Jeannie keeps the elves in check
and the presents on time,

34:56.011 --> 34:57.221
and I just love her to death.

34:57.221 --> 34:58.597
Aww.

34:58.597 --> 35:01.600
- Now, we met at the U of M.
- Go, Gophers!

35:01.600 --> 35:03.644
And specifically at a Christmas party,

35:03.644 --> 35:07.356
and that is why today has always
been so special to all of us.

35:07.356 --> 35:09.817
And as you know, this is the season

35:09.817 --> 35:13.278
where we think about love
and peace and happiness.

35:13.278 --> 35:14.988
And of course, family.
That's what this is all about.

35:14.988 --> 35:17.366
Honey, it's family.
Family, family.

35:18.534 --> 35:20.619
Thank you so much to the carolers.

35:20.619 --> 35:24.164
And of course, Gumdrop the Goat,
whose real name's Stingray.

35:25.457 --> 35:27.960
That's a Christmas
present right there.

35:27.960 --> 35:30.546
- Yeah.
- Well, I hope everybody has a good time.

35:30.546 --> 35:32.214
Eat, drink, and be merry!

35:32.214 --> 35:34.758
-  Oh, no.
- And buy some cars!

35:34.758 --> 35:36.635
- And buy some cars!

35:39.304 --> 35:40.722
Ali, don't be afraid.
No, no, no.

35:40.722 --> 35:42.558
No, no.

35:42.558 --> 35:46.520
- Oh, is she okay?
- Good goat. Good goat. Good goat.

35:46.520 --> 35:47.646
Ali, take off.

35:49.356 --> 35:51.400
- No.
- No.

35:51.400 --> 35:54.736
What is it doing to me?

36:09.585 --> 36:11.128
Your parents ended the night early.

36:11.128 --> 36:12.671
Yeah.

36:12.671 --> 36:16.300
Um, it's kinda their anniversary,
if you know what I mean.

36:16.300 --> 36:19.094
Every year they go home early
for intercourse.

36:19.094 --> 36:22.806
Thank you, Elliot!
Yeah, that's what I meant.

36:22.806 --> 36:24.516
- That's very healthy!
- Yeah.

36:24.516 --> 36:27.144
The rest of us just come here
to drink until the coast is clear.

36:28.729 --> 36:31.732
Well, maybe it's time for you
to take me home, yeah?

36:31.732 --> 36:33.734
Oh, okay that's my cue to leave.

36:33.734 --> 36:35.569
Hi. I'm Ali.

36:35.569 --> 36:37.821
Jess, I've heard so much about you.

36:37.821 --> 36:41.033
You have?
What did you hear?

36:41.033 --> 36:44.661
You know-- on that note,
I'm gonna get another one.

36:44.661 --> 36:47.873
I don't even need one, but I think
I should probably get another one.

36:48.332 --> 36:52.586
So, Jess, I just wanna say,
between us girls,

36:52.586 --> 36:56.340
I am so happy for Graham
that he finally found someone

36:56.340 --> 37:00.135
who's okay with his, you know,
little candy cane problem.

37:00.135 --> 37:02.804
Whoa... disappointed.

37:03.805 --> 37:07.559
But you know, he'll tell you
that it's never happened to him before,

37:07.559 --> 37:09.811
and he just wants
a little shoulder rub and a cuddle.

37:09.811 --> 37:12.189
Well, you know what people say.

37:12.189 --> 37:14.358
Every couple has their own chemistry.

37:14.358 --> 37:16.193
Well, that's not chemistry, that's...

37:16.193 --> 37:17.819
Physics.

37:17.819 --> 37:19.112
Mm-hmm.

37:19.112 --> 37:22.783
Has he told you he loves you yet?
He'll tell you tonight.

37:22.783 --> 37:24.910
I wonder what she's
saying about you, dude.

37:27.454 --> 37:30.332
Oh, thank you.
Are you trying to tell me something?

37:44.888 --> 37:47.182
Melinda Persephone Stroop.

37:47.808 --> 37:49.184
You are such a buzzkill!

37:49.184 --> 37:50.686
What are you talking about?
What are you doing?

37:50.686 --> 37:51.979
Oh, just enjoying my life!

37:51.979 --> 37:53.814
Enjoying your life
cheating on Heather?

37:53.814 --> 37:55.065
I'm not cheating on Heather.

37:55.065 --> 37:56.775
I'm not cheating on Heather,
by the way. I'm single.

37:56.775 --> 37:58.402
Oh, you're not cheating on Heather?
What do you call that?

37:58.402 --> 38:00.445
This seems like a private moment.

38:00.445 --> 38:01.738
I'm single. Thank you.

38:01.738 --> 38:03.573
What are you talking about?

38:03.573 --> 38:06.368
Well, maybe if you actually asked
about Heather, then you would know.

38:08.495 --> 38:09.871
How are things with Heather?

38:12.457 --> 38:16.253
We broke up, okay?

38:19.089 --> 38:20.257
I'm so sorry.

38:22.092 --> 38:26.221
I know how much you love her.
This must be so hard.

38:26.221 --> 38:31.184
Yeah. Sometimes love isn't enough.

38:33.979 --> 38:35.063
Hey...

38:36.064 --> 38:38.567
- Can you give us a... second?
- It's okay. Ali knows.

38:38.567 --> 38:40.402
Aw, sweetie.

38:40.402 --> 38:42.696
You told Ali. Why didn't you tell me?

38:42.696 --> 38:46.575
I dunno, because I was...
embarrassed to admit that,

38:46.575 --> 38:48.744
you know, my shit's
as messed up as yours.

38:48.744 --> 38:51.455
I didn't want to Stroop
down to your level--

38:51.455 --> 38:55.834
stoop down to your level.

38:55.834 --> 38:58.378
Hi. Um, this might be bad timing,

38:58.378 --> 39:00.464
but that's my number.

39:00.464 --> 39:04.551
Uh, good kiss. Sorry.

39:04.551 --> 39:06.553
No, I'm sorry for interrupting.

39:06.553 --> 39:07.721
Bye!

39:07.721 --> 39:09.139
She's single.

39:09.139 --> 39:10.974
- Quinn.
- She's cute.

39:10.974 --> 39:13.226
- She's really cute.
- Mm-hmm.

39:13.226 --> 39:15.687
-  And I still got it.
- Okay.

39:15.687 --> 39:17.272
And I still got it.

39:17.272 --> 39:20.317
All right. We're gonna
got you some water, okay?

39:20.317 --> 39:22.402
But I already like that girl
more than Heather, so...

39:22.402 --> 39:23.570
- Really?
- Yeah.

39:24.654 --> 39:27.699
Here is my number.

39:27.699 --> 39:30.577
Maybe you could tuck me into bed later.

39:31.119 --> 39:32.329
Oh, wow.

39:34.998 --> 39:35.999
Give me your phone.

39:35.999 --> 39:37.084
Oh, yeah, it's right--

39:37.084 --> 39:39.169
Here it is. It's locked.

39:39.169 --> 39:43.048
- I'm sorry.
- Okay. Here's my number.

39:43.048 --> 39:45.759
Oh, thank you.

39:48.178 --> 39:49.554
Ouch.

39:49.554 --> 39:50.639
Boop.

39:52.182 --> 39:55.852
Oh, my God, that was-- sexy.

39:56.311 --> 39:57.687
- Did you like that?
- I love that.

39:57.687 --> 39:59.314
It, like, loved you.

39:59.314 --> 40:02.150
Thanks, Mike.
These are on him. Okay?

40:03.026 --> 40:04.694
- You'll call me?
- Yes.

40:05.237 --> 40:08.406
Oh, no, no, no, one.
You get one. You get one.

40:08.406 --> 40:09.491
I'm gonna call you right now.

40:10.700 --> 40:13.662
Okay. All right.
Almost home.

40:13.662 --> 40:18.083
- Shh, shh, shh!
-  That was so much fun.

40:20.001 --> 40:22.212
Come on, yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:22.212 --> 40:24.631
Everyone shoes off. Shoes off.

40:24.631 --> 40:26.925
You gotta get shoes off
of her and change.

40:26.925 --> 40:28.760
Shh, shh!

40:28.760 --> 40:32.472
Okay. But actually, what if we
wake Mom up 'cause she'll cook?

40:32.472 --> 40:35.267
Mom!

40:35.267 --> 40:37.269
Elliot! Elliot, God!

40:37.269 --> 40:38.937
It makes me so happy
that we're all hanging out,

40:38.937 --> 40:41.022
but sad that you guys
aren't getting back together.

40:41.022 --> 40:41.982
Oh...

40:41.982 --> 40:44.568
I want a little kissy.
Give me a little kissy. Come on.

40:48.280 --> 40:50.115
No, no-- oh, God, oh, God!
No, no. This way. This way!

40:50.115 --> 40:52.367
- Someone get her water.
- Get her hair! Get her hair!

41:11.469 --> 41:13.597
<i>I'm trying so hard here, Graham.
I just--</i>

41:13.597 --> 41:15.724
I don't really know
what else you want from me.

41:18.351 --> 41:19.728
Well, you don't talk about it. You just--

41:19.728 --> 41:22.772
I do, I do. I talked about it before,
but you never listen to me

41:22.772 --> 41:25.400
because it's always about you
and your job and your work.

41:25.400 --> 41:27.652
<i>That's all anything is ever about.</i>

42:01.728 --> 42:04.856
-  <i>Okay. So, I have a few ideas.</i>
-  <i>Okay, hit me with them.</i>

42:04.856 --> 42:07.484
<i>I dunno, I've been thinking
about Frosti by Ali.</i>

42:07.484 --> 42:09.569
- Frosti?
- Frosty like the Snowman.

42:09.569 --> 42:12.322
- With "I's" instead of "Y's."
- Yeah.

42:12.781 --> 42:13.782
Al...

42:15.659 --> 42:16.868
Um...

42:18.328 --> 42:20.872
I love you so much,
and I was gonna wait to do this.

42:20.872 --> 42:23.667
And I had this whole big thing.
But I can't-- this is like--

42:23.667 --> 42:26.586
I just gotta-- I love you so much.
Will you marry me?

42:43.561 --> 42:47.065
We're engaged!
We're getting married!

42:47.065 --> 42:48.775
Oh, my God, look at my hands.

43:21.683 --> 43:24.227
All right. Who's ready
for some male bonding?

43:24.227 --> 43:25.937
What are you doing here?

43:26.771 --> 43:29.399
We invited her. A little "bonding"
might do these two some good.

43:29.399 --> 43:30.483
Gross.

43:30.483 --> 43:32.819
And I couldn't give up the chance
to spend some quality time

43:32.819 --> 43:35.030
with my favorite ex-father-in-law--

43:35.030 --> 43:37.032
-  Thank you.
-  No. No, no, no.

43:37.032 --> 43:39.326
Ali, this is a guy's trip, okay?

43:39.326 --> 43:44.164
It's about farting and burping
and just telling stupid jokes.

43:44.164 --> 43:45.665
Oh, settle down, Graham.

43:45.665 --> 43:48.418
We could use a little
female energy in the Stroop shack.

43:48.418 --> 43:49.711
What are you talking about?

43:49.711 --> 43:52.422
The whole point of these trips
is to avoid female energy.

43:52.422 --> 43:54.215
Times change, and if you
don't change with them,

43:54.215 --> 43:55.925
you're gonna end up
marrying your own hand.

43:55.925 --> 43:57.344
He's meaning masturbation.

43:57.344 --> 43:58.762
Thank you, Elliot. I got that.

43:58.762 --> 44:00.764
Oh, God. I don't wanna
alarm anybody,

44:00.764 --> 44:03.016
but it looks like
baby Jesus is missing again.

44:03.016 --> 44:04.100
What?

44:05.310 --> 44:07.187
- Oh, no!
- Oh, boy.

44:07.187 --> 44:09.564
- I don't think we should tell Mom.
- No, no, no!

44:09.564 --> 44:10.982
- Don't tell Mom.
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

44:11.941 --> 44:13.234
Let's just drive.

44:18.073 --> 44:19.449
How's everything in L.A.?

44:19.449 --> 44:21.785
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
L.A., it's warm.

44:21.785 --> 44:24.662
It's warm, and it's nice.
Job's really good.

44:24.662 --> 44:26.122
- How about you, Ali?
-  Oh, good.

44:26.122 --> 44:29.376
So, my whole life is so perfect.

44:29.376 --> 44:32.379
I love my house,
which is really more of a home,

44:32.379 --> 44:34.756
as you can probably tell
from all the FaceTimes.

44:34.756 --> 44:35.840
Very nice.

44:35.840 --> 44:37.467
I know. I got kicked out of it.

44:37.467 --> 44:39.928
Darn it, I forgot my joint.

44:39.928 --> 44:41.388
Oh, Dennis!

44:41.388 --> 44:44.516
I didn't know you were
a cannabis connoisseur.

44:44.516 --> 44:47.268
Well, my doctor prescribes it
for chronic back pain.

44:47.268 --> 44:49.729
Well, he didn't really prescribe it.
He handed it to me at a party.

44:51.272 --> 44:53.233
Mom can't stand the smell of weed.

44:53.233 --> 44:55.276
She only lets him do edibles
in the house.

44:56.069 --> 44:58.780
Are you two dating?
Not each other, but are you dating?

44:58.780 --> 45:00.865
- Yeah. Yeah, everyone.
-  Everyone?

45:00.865 --> 45:03.410
Yeah. Not discriminating
against any dating app.

45:03.410 --> 45:06.788
- Just going headfirst.
-  Wow, that's disgusting.

45:06.788 --> 45:08.623
Well, everybody has different beliefs.

45:09.707 --> 45:11.459
I, for one, don't think COVID's real.

45:14.629 --> 45:16.631
Do you mind pointing
the heater towards me

45:16.631 --> 45:18.091
for a second there, Dennis, please?

45:18.091 --> 45:19.676
No, you don't have to do that.
It's fine where it is.

45:19.676 --> 45:21.302
- It's getting everybody, I think.
-  How's that?

45:21.302 --> 45:23.179
- Whoo, it is good.
- Good?

45:23.179 --> 45:25.849
It's not a problem. There you go.
There, are you happy?

45:25.849 --> 45:27.767
Oh, God, yeah. That's good.

45:31.479 --> 45:32.981
Guys! I think I got something!

45:32.981 --> 45:34.524
- Oh!
-  Okay, just be gentle.

45:34.524 --> 45:36.693
- There you go, Elliot. Gentle, gentle.
- Aah! Help me!

45:36.693 --> 45:39.070
- Don't gentle! Reel it in fast!
- No, no, go gentle.

45:39.070 --> 45:41.030
-  I'm trying!
-  Can you please point it towards me?

45:41.030 --> 45:42.657
- We're gonna have it for everybody.
- Can I please have it?

45:42.657 --> 45:44.701
If you're so cold,
maybe go back to California.

45:44.701 --> 45:46.828
Graham!
Let me have it. I'm freezing!

45:46.828 --> 45:48.663
- Okay, good.
-  Give me the damn heater!

45:48.663 --> 45:50.790
- Fine! Want it?

45:53.376 --> 45:56.296
- What'd you do?
- What do you mean, what did I do?

45:56.296 --> 45:58.840
-  What the hell?
- You asked for it, so I gave it to you!

45:58.840 --> 46:00.425
We could've all been electrocuted.

46:00.425 --> 46:02.510
This is the worst
Christmas Eve I've ever had.

46:06.764 --> 46:09.893
Well, I'm sorry we didn't
tell you it was missing sooner.

46:11.811 --> 46:13.855
- Mimosa?
- I'd like a mimosa.

46:13.855 --> 46:15.190
Okay, let's go.

46:19.402 --> 46:21.738
Please save some of those
for me to nibble on later. Just a few.

46:21.738 --> 46:23.823
'Cause they add a nice crunch to it.

46:23.823 --> 46:26.451
I understand,
but I just like nibbling a little bit.

46:26.451 --> 46:28.244
Oh, still no luggage, I see.

46:28.244 --> 46:31.414
How can you tell? The, uh,
ginormous pants or the itchy sweater?

46:31.414 --> 46:33.500
- Oh, honey, I love it. It looks festive.
- It's the pants?

46:33.500 --> 46:35.043
It's festive, all right.

46:35.043 --> 46:37.837
Now, more importantly,
where are Dad's Christmas cookies?

46:37.837 --> 46:39.672
I've been here two days
and haven't had one.

46:39.672 --> 46:41.508
Well, you're not gonna see them
because ever since Ali

46:41.508 --> 46:43.384
got that write-up in <i>L.A. Magazine</i>,

46:43.384 --> 46:45.220
your dad decided too much competition.

46:45.220 --> 46:47.305
We're letting Ali do all the baking.

46:47.305 --> 46:49.057
-  What write-up?
- What?

46:49.057 --> 46:51.726
- Just a profile thing.
- Oh, just a--!

46:51.726 --> 46:54.145
It was <i>L.A. Magazine</i>.
It was huge.

46:54.145 --> 46:57.524
They said that ever since Ali
took over Laila's Cafe,

46:57.524 --> 46:59.150
it's become a Westside staple

46:59.150 --> 47:03.655
and that Angelenos are now
hungering to see what she'll do next.

47:03.655 --> 47:05.448
Wow, someone memorized it.

47:05.448 --> 47:06.783
Yeah.

47:07.909 --> 47:12.247
That's great, Al. So, you quit
your accounting job to bake?

47:12.247 --> 47:13.957
Well, it was a long time coming.

47:13.957 --> 47:15.333
Yes, it was, missy.

47:15.333 --> 47:16.960
That's awesome.

47:16.960 --> 47:18.962
What are you gonna do next?
Are you gonna do the bake truck?

47:21.172 --> 47:23.758
Uh... well, thank you
for remembering that.

47:23.758 --> 47:26.803
No, um-- well, I mean, maybe.

47:26.803 --> 47:28.555
I don't-- I don't know yet.

47:29.472 --> 47:32.350
-  What's stopping you?
-  Well, the plan was...

47:32.350 --> 47:35.228
I was supposed to get a truck
and fix it up,

47:35.228 --> 47:39.607
but the car guy who promised
to help me do that... didn't.

47:39.607 --> 47:41.025
Oh, wh-what guy was that?

47:41.025 --> 47:43.319
It's Graham.
It's Graham, Mom, you know?

47:44.404 --> 47:46.573
Sounds like a bit of a-- a jerk.

47:46.573 --> 47:50.201
He sure does, Mom.
He sounds like a huge, huge jerk.

47:50.201 --> 47:54.205
And I bet he would love
to help you out now

47:54.205 --> 47:55.999
if you needed me to look at a car.

47:55.999 --> 47:58.835
Just like as a friend
and a one-time thing.

47:59.836 --> 48:00.962
It's a little too late now.

48:02.630 --> 48:04.632
Doo-doo-doo!
The ham's in the smoker!

48:04.632 --> 48:06.342
-  Yay!
-  Dad dropped it!

48:06.342 --> 48:08.303
Okay. Snitches gets stitches, Elliot.

48:08.303 --> 48:09.470
You dropped it in the pool!

48:09.470 --> 48:11.556
It'll make it tastier.
Listen, the dressing is done.

48:11.556 --> 48:13.850
So... maybe we could
put on my favorite?

48:13.850 --> 48:16.102
<i>Basic Instinct</i>?

48:16.102 --> 48:18.396
- I'm kidding. <i>White Christmas</i> it is.
- Yeah, great.

48:18.396 --> 48:22.025
Yes, Rosemary Clooney
was my first crush.

48:22.025 --> 48:24.569
Do I smell like turkey?

48:26.446 --> 48:31.409
So, Ali, is the whole
food truck thing that--

48:34.037 --> 48:36.414
Is the food truck thing the re--

48:39.792 --> 48:42.754
Okay. Something tells me
you don't want to talk about it right now.

48:45.840 --> 48:48.468
Okay, fine. Fine, fine, fine.

48:48.468 --> 48:50.428
You wanna play that game.

48:50.428 --> 48:53.640
I will just have to concoct
something unique and amazing

48:53.640 --> 48:56.351
that makes your dish taste like farts.

49:08.821 --> 49:12.408

- It's a cheese-mix soufflé.

50:32.822 --> 50:35.533
- Is that what it should look like?
- I don't know. It's French.

50:36.492 --> 50:39.579
Welp, looks like our
special guest has arrived.

50:39.579 --> 50:42.498
Wouldn't be Christmas Eve
without our number one salesman.

50:42.498 --> 50:43.583
Why would you invite him?

50:43.583 --> 50:46.085
Anyway, be nice.
Can somebody get the door?

50:46.085 --> 50:47.462
- I'll get it.
- I'll get it.

50:47.462 --> 50:49.464
-  Okay, I'll get it.
-  I'll get it.

50:50.423 --> 50:53.509
- Hey... Jess?
- Hey, got your text.

50:54.260 --> 50:58.681
Right. The text that I--
sent you earlier. Great.

50:59.140 --> 51:01.726
- Hey, bro.

51:01.726 --> 51:04.145
- Yes.
- Oh, mistletoe.

51:04.145 --> 51:07.398
- Huh, would you look at that.
- Look at that.

51:10.276 --> 51:11.277
Okay.

51:13.321 --> 51:15.323
Mm... Oh, boy.

51:15.323 --> 51:17.867
Got to tell you, Ali, these cookies
are just jingling my balls

51:17.867 --> 51:18.951
in all the right places.

51:18.951 --> 51:21.078
- Ew, Dad.
- Bells. Bells.

51:21.078 --> 51:22.455
I know what you mean.

51:22.455 --> 51:25.875
Well, I'm avoiding them.
Trying to stay in shape, so.

51:25.875 --> 51:27.168
So, you actually chose the pear shape?

51:27.168 --> 51:28.586
Oh, snap!

51:28.586 --> 51:30.880
Ohh!

51:30.880 --> 51:33.216
He went there. Okay.

51:33.216 --> 51:35.676
Sooner or later,
you're gonna get the Stroop chin.

51:35.676 --> 51:38.387
Now you see it. Now you don't.

51:38.387 --> 51:41.265
It's coming. It's coming your way
in about ten years.

51:41.265 --> 51:45.061
Well, I love your shape.
And I stayed away from the sugar, too.

51:45.061 --> 51:49.774
Thank you, Jess. You're so sweet
and funny and kind and beautiful.

51:49.774 --> 51:52.151
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

51:52.151 --> 51:54.737
So good. Mmm.

51:54.737 --> 51:56.113
Oh, yeah.

52:02.286 --> 52:04.914
Okay. Starting to sound
a little pornographic in here.

52:04.914 --> 52:08.668
Oh, wow, these are so good!

52:09.794 --> 52:13.089
It's like all the food's
just better this year.

52:14.215 --> 52:16.050
Yeah, food was great.
I mean, it would've been better

52:16.050 --> 52:17.927
if we had fish for the Feast
of the Seven Fishes, right, Dad?

52:17.927 --> 52:19.136
That's your fault.

52:30.565 --> 52:32.149
Oh, come on. Stop it.

52:36.654 --> 52:38.030
What is going on right now?

52:38.030 --> 52:42.201
Well, Graham, it's called fun.
Do you remember? Fun?

52:46.455 --> 52:47.999
Damn, this is good.

52:50.167 --> 52:51.252
What?

52:51.252 --> 52:53.087
What the hell
is wrong with you guys?

52:53.087 --> 52:56.632
You don't know anymore
how to have fun.

52:56.632 --> 52:58.301
- Do you feel okay?
- I feel fine.

52:58.301 --> 53:01.762
- You're so talented, Jeannie.
- That is so realistic.

53:02.471 --> 53:03.472
What?

53:11.647 --> 53:13.190
Oh, my God, the cookies.

53:13.190 --> 53:15.651
What? What about the cookies?

53:15.651 --> 53:17.778
You guys ate the cookies.
You're freaking out.

53:17.778 --> 53:20.072
We didn't touch the cookies.
We're fine.

53:20.072 --> 53:23.075
Ali poisoned you guys.
She's trying to ruin Christmas.

53:23.075 --> 53:25.036
- No.
-  Yeah. Ali ?

53:25.036 --> 53:27.622
- I'm eating them, too.
-  Wait, am I dying?

53:27.622 --> 53:31.083
Well, Mom, as soon
as you are born, you start dying.

53:31.083 --> 53:34.587
Ali , did you, uh, by any chance
make the cookies with this?

53:34.587 --> 53:37.548
Yeah. The-- the-- the thick butter.

53:37.548 --> 53:40.551
Oh, boy.

53:40.551 --> 53:43.262
Oh, Ali, you sweet dummy--

53:43.262 --> 53:46.933
it's not thick butter.
It's THC butter.

53:46.933 --> 53:48.225
That's my bad back butter.

53:48.225 --> 53:52.271
Ali made the cookies with weed,
Mom. You're all stoned.

53:58.694 --> 54:03.491
Well, I just-- whoops.

54:03.491 --> 54:06.285
You gotta be kidding me.
You hate weed!

54:06.285 --> 54:09.872
Honey, everything
that God creates is perfect.

54:09.872 --> 54:11.999
So, if God created that,
then it's perfect,

54:11.999 --> 54:13.709
and I'm down with the sticky icky.

54:13.709 --> 54:15.878
Oh, my God, this is why
I can never win with this family.

54:15.878 --> 54:18.923
I get caught with a joint,
I get grounded for a month.

54:18.923 --> 54:21.217
But Ali brings Woodstock
to Christmas,

54:21.217 --> 54:23.678
and Mom's down
with the sticky icky?

54:24.261 --> 54:27.431
Well, we were just trying
to be good parents.

54:27.431 --> 54:28.516
No, I'm--

54:28.516 --> 54:30.476
You are good parents.
You're great parents.

54:30.476 --> 54:34.146
You're like the perfect couple
on top of a wedding cake.

54:34.146 --> 54:36.691
Well, not something you'll have
to worry about for yourself for a while.

54:39.026 --> 54:40.611
Oh, crap.

54:41.362 --> 54:43.531
- Thank you, Graham.
- Sorry.

54:43.531 --> 54:45.908
What? What? Melinda?
What does that mean?

54:48.327 --> 54:50.538
- Heather and I broke up.
- What?

54:50.538 --> 54:52.039
She moved out last week.

54:52.039 --> 54:55.835
- Oh, honey.
-  Ohh. Mindy, I'm so sorry.

54:55.835 --> 54:57.294
Yeah. I'm sorry that I let you down.

54:57.294 --> 54:58.838
Oh, honey, didn't let me down.

54:58.838 --> 55:01.298
Can't let Mommy down. Never,
nobody can ever let Mommy down.

55:01.298 --> 55:03.884
- Mommy's always up.
- I just miss her, and I just...

55:03.884 --> 55:06.137
feel like I should call her.
I should call her.

55:06.137 --> 55:08.764
- No, not now.

55:08.764 --> 55:10.683
Yes. I should tell her how I feel!

55:12.184 --> 55:14.937
Where's my password?
I need to call her!

55:14.937 --> 55:16.897
- Come here, sweetheart.
- Could you type in "Heather"?

55:16.897 --> 55:18.190
Well, why don't we talk about it?
Do it tomorrow.

55:18.190 --> 55:19.942
I need to tell her
that I think that we could--

55:19.942 --> 55:22.445
Yeah. Let's just not do it today.

55:22.445 --> 55:23.946
I'm gonna go, too.

55:23.946 --> 55:26.824
Too much intergenerational
trauma on display here.

55:30.536 --> 55:31.746
Wow, Graham.

55:32.747 --> 55:35.207
You couldn't even sabotage me right.

55:35.624 --> 55:37.168
You know what I think?

55:37.168 --> 55:40.254
I think that you should
just concede now

55:40.254 --> 55:43.841
and take a nice,
safe flight back to L.A.

55:43.841 --> 55:48.804
because it's Christmas Eve,
and that means it's your last chance.

55:52.349 --> 55:56.187
Hey, why don't we get out of here?
Give everyone a moment?

55:57.646 --> 56:00.649
Yeah. I think that's a good idea.
The further away, the better.

56:02.485 --> 56:05.404
Don't forget your secret ingredient.

56:05.404 --> 56:07.990
Yeah, we should, uh--
we should probably head out, too.

56:07.990 --> 56:10.659
Let me take you somewhere
I like to unwind.

56:10.659 --> 56:12.620
Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, they're gone. Let's go.

56:21.128 --> 56:22.338
Do you want some gum?

56:22.838 --> 56:23.839
Sure.

56:29.386 --> 56:33.224
Minty. I took you
for a cinnamon kinda girl.

56:33.224 --> 56:36.185
I'm still trying to find out
if you're a little fruity.

56:36.185 --> 56:38.896
Oh, you know what they say:
everybody's a little fruity.

56:39.480 --> 56:41.357
- Let's find out.
- What?

56:45.569 --> 56:48.447
- Hi.
- You want some gum?

56:48.447 --> 56:49.532
Mm-hmm.

56:51.033 --> 56:55.788
Oh, uh-- you really like gum, huh?

56:55.788 --> 56:58.958
Mm-hmm. Do you wanna
come back to our place?

56:59.959 --> 57:01.710
- Oh, your place?
- This is Randy.

57:01.710 --> 57:05.881
He's, um, my roommate
and special... friend.

57:05.881 --> 57:07.341
Cool. Cool, cool, cool.

57:07.341 --> 57:10.302
Um, one second, okay? Just one.

57:11.470 --> 57:14.056
Oh, he's hydrating. I like that.

57:14.056 --> 57:18.352
I like it. I know you hydrate as well.

57:20.104 --> 57:22.606
Whew! Okay.

57:23.983 --> 57:26.485
Nope, can't do it.
Okay, it's not you. It's me.

57:26.485 --> 57:28.571
You guys are great.
You're both beautiful.

57:28.571 --> 57:30.156
It's awesome.
You're gonna have a great time.

57:30.156 --> 57:31.282
Goodbye!

57:34.076 --> 57:35.744
Surprise.

57:38.998 --> 57:41.542
Oh. Oh, this is where
you come to unwind.

57:42.001 --> 57:44.044
Yeah. It's a place of man
and metal

57:44.044 --> 57:46.547
and pistons and the smell
of burnt gasoline.

57:46.547 --> 57:49.967
- Yeah.
- 440 pound-feet of torque at 2,000 RPM.

57:49.967 --> 57:53.679
Vroom, vroom, vroom,
vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom!

57:53.679 --> 57:56.098
Whew!

57:56.098 --> 57:59.393
It's like taking a gut punch
as soon as you press on the gas.

57:59.393 --> 58:03.814
I'm sorry. I get carried away.
I love my job. Uh...

58:03.814 --> 58:08.194
It's passion, and that's really--
that is something.

58:08.903 --> 58:11.780
Okay. Well, just know, if you're the one
hitting the brakes on this bad boy,

58:11.780 --> 58:15.701
she stops from 65 in only 160 feet.

58:16.660 --> 58:18.621
Is that-- is that good?

58:18.621 --> 58:20.956
- Is that good? It's great.
- Oh.

58:20.956 --> 58:22.791
Plus, you would look amazing doing it.

58:22.791 --> 58:25.920
And you can order it in a custom color
to match your favorite purse.

58:27.963 --> 58:30.090
Are you trying to sell me this car?

58:31.759 --> 58:33.677
Are you trying to buy it?

58:34.678 --> 58:35.679
I guess not.

58:38.307 --> 58:40.017
All right, well, lemme just lock up.

58:41.101 --> 58:42.853
And just so you know,

58:42.853 --> 58:46.482
I would've hooked you up with, like,
a one-year manufacturer's warranty.

58:50.277 --> 58:53.322
Yes. No, sir. No, yeah, yeah. I get it.

58:53.322 --> 58:54.573
Thank you.

58:54.573 --> 58:57.243
I'm just saying,
I don't really think it's realistic.

58:57.243 --> 58:59.536
It's Christmas Eve, and I--

59:01.580 --> 59:02.873
Yes, okay, Mr. Tusk.

59:02.873 --> 59:05.584
I will figure it out.

59:05.584 --> 59:07.628
Yeah, Merry Christmas.

59:10.547 --> 59:11.548
Huh.

59:28.065 --> 59:29.525
- Ow!
- Ow!

59:29.525 --> 59:30.609
What the hell?

59:30.609 --> 59:33.237
Oh, my God. What the hell
are you doing in my room?

59:33.237 --> 59:36.156
Wait, you gave it to me, remember?

59:36.156 --> 59:39.118
Now that you mention it, I do! Sorry!

59:39.118 --> 59:42.371
What happened to what's-her-face, huh?
Couldn't seal the deal?

59:42.371 --> 59:44.290
Oh, wouldn't you like to know?

59:44.290 --> 59:47.167
You know what, yeah,
the deal was sealed,

59:47.167 --> 59:49.670
except she had a friend,

59:49.670 --> 59:52.798
and he was not my type, so... no.

59:52.798 --> 59:55.092
Shocker, shocker.
Mr. Adventurous.

59:55.092 --> 59:57.845
Oh, how'd it go with Brady?
Was he even into you?

59:57.845 --> 59:59.680
Or did he just want to sell you a car?

59:59.680 --> 01:00:01.181
Yeah, no. He sold me a car,

01:00:01.181 --> 01:00:03.684
and he sold me on his height
and his muscular build.

01:00:03.684 --> 01:00:05.811
We're gonna ride off
into the sunset together.

01:00:05.811 --> 01:00:06.895
- We are in love now.
- That's great.

01:00:06.895 --> 01:00:09.440
You guys can have tiny
little used car salesman babies.

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:11.317
- You want a Volvo?
- And they'll come for Christmas, too.

01:00:11.317 --> 01:00:13.694
- God, I hate your face so much.
- I hate you. You know what?

01:00:13.694 --> 01:00:16.363
- You are such a dick!
- You are such a--

01:00:16.363 --> 01:00:20.117
- I just hate you!
- I hate you so much!

01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:33.088
- This is so gross.
- I hate your bangs.

01:00:39.303 --> 01:00:41.638
- We are not having sex.
- Of course not.

01:00:42.431 --> 01:00:43.599
- I'm serious!
- Me, too.

01:00:44.850 --> 01:00:46.727
- No cuddling.
- Ew.

01:00:48.187 --> 01:00:50.731
-  Just shut up.

01:01:35.484 --> 01:01:38.612
- You still sleeping?
- Shh. I'm sleeping. Be quiet.

01:01:38.612 --> 01:01:40.406
Mm-hmm.

01:01:43.158 --> 01:01:46.620
- Should we talk about it?
- No, no. No, I'm still sleeping.

01:01:47.830 --> 01:01:52.584
Okay, fine. You fake sleep,
and I'll talk.

01:01:57.714 --> 01:01:59.967
Did you kick me out because
of the whole food truck thing?

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:05.180
Well, you are drastically oversimplifying.

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:09.309
But, yeah, I guess it was emblematic.

01:02:12.938 --> 01:02:15.774
Okay. Well, I--

01:02:17.276 --> 01:02:19.528
I've been thinking, and, um...

01:02:21.363 --> 01:02:24.616
not that this makes it okay,
but I think that...

01:02:25.701 --> 01:02:29.079
maybe I was retaliating

01:02:29.079 --> 01:02:32.082
because I wasn't getting

01:02:32.082 --> 01:02:36.295
the encouragement that I needed from you.

01:02:37.379 --> 01:02:40.257
I just-- I...

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:43.343
I feel like I wasn't...

01:02:44.553 --> 01:02:47.848
always able to be there for you
because I was working so hard

01:02:47.848 --> 01:02:51.268
to try and, you know, get promoted

01:02:51.268 --> 01:02:52.936
and-- and get bonuses

01:02:52.936 --> 01:02:57.024
so that we could build
the life that we wanted.

01:02:58.233 --> 01:03:02.905
And we'd get married, and have kids,
and buy a house,

01:03:02.905 --> 01:03:04.656
and-- and travel.

01:03:07.409 --> 01:03:10.329
And um... I don't know.

01:03:10.329 --> 01:03:13.332
I just feel like I was doing
all those things for us,

01:03:13.332 --> 01:03:15.459
and maybe I started
to resent the fact

01:03:15.459 --> 01:03:19.963
that you weren't
super excited about it.

01:03:23.217 --> 01:03:24.218
Yeah.

01:03:27.221 --> 01:03:32.351
So, you were focusing
on what you thought I needed,

01:03:32.351 --> 01:03:36.396
but what I really needed
was you to just be with me.

01:03:41.193 --> 01:03:42.528
Merry Christmas!

01:03:42.528 --> 01:03:44.029
Ali, wakey, wakey!

01:03:44.029 --> 01:03:45.113
One second!

01:03:45.113 --> 01:03:46.782
- What? Ow!
- Get out!

01:03:46.782 --> 01:03:48.116
- Just go!
- You get out!

01:03:48.116 --> 01:03:49.535
You get out! I'm supposed to be here.

01:03:49.535 --> 01:03:51.703
- Where are my clothes?
- This is my bed. I don't know.

01:03:51.703 --> 01:03:52.871
Get dressed and hide!

01:03:52.871 --> 01:03:55.832
I'm putting some stuff on, okay?
What do you mean, hide?

01:03:57.209 --> 01:03:59.545
- Shh! Shh! Shut up!
Honey, I'm coming in.

01:03:59.545 --> 01:04:01.922
- Shh! You shh!
-  I'm coming in, Ali.

01:04:02.965 --> 01:04:05.175
Come on in!

01:04:05.175 --> 01:04:07.970
Merry Christmas, Ali.

01:04:09.012 --> 01:04:10.722
- Graham?
- Yeah.

01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:12.558
Whatcha doing here?

01:04:14.059 --> 01:04:16.228
'Bout to iron some clothes.

01:04:16.228 --> 01:04:17.521
This is Ali 's room.

01:04:17.521 --> 01:04:20.065
Yeah, we swapped for the night.
She wanted the couch. I dunno.

01:04:20.065 --> 01:04:23.110
- I didn't see her down there on the couch.
- I know, weird. That's fine.

01:04:23.110 --> 01:04:24.903
There, right there's good. Thank you.

01:04:24.903 --> 01:04:27.656
Honey, what's going on?
You're not dressed yet for church.

01:04:27.656 --> 01:04:28.740
- I know--
- It's Christmas.

01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:31.034
- Merry Christmas, sweetheart.
- Merry Christmas, Mom.

01:04:31.034 --> 01:04:34.913
That's why I had the--
had the iron board out.

01:04:35.914 --> 01:04:38.917
Um, look-- I can't come to church, okay?

01:04:38.917 --> 01:04:41.712
I gotta finish my coding playthrough.
It's not gonna take long.

01:04:41.712 --> 01:04:44.006
Graham, for heaven's sake,
you're coming with this family to church.

01:04:44.006 --> 01:04:47.509
And don't worry, while you get ready,
you and I are gonna have a little chat.

01:04:48.010 --> 01:04:52.264
Freeze. Deal.
I'm in for church. I'm pumped.

01:04:52.264 --> 01:04:53.557
But let's talk after.

01:04:53.557 --> 01:04:54.933
No, sweetheart, we need to do it now.

01:04:54.933 --> 01:04:56.059
Just careful.
Right there's good.

01:04:56.059 --> 01:05:00.314
I think that we need, um,
a little private chat about Ali, okay?

01:05:01.398 --> 01:05:02.441
- Now?
- Yes, now.

01:05:02.441 --> 01:05:05.444
I just-- I just don't
want her to hear, okay, honey?

01:05:06.153 --> 01:05:08.780
Well, then...
we better be real quiet.

01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:09.865
-  Okay.
-  Okay.

01:05:09.865 --> 01:05:12.034
All right. All I wanna say is...

01:05:12.034 --> 01:05:15.287
I know we shouldn't have kept her
coming here a secret from you,

01:05:15.287 --> 01:05:16.872
so I do apologize for that.

01:05:16.872 --> 01:05:19.958
But I don't think that we're wrong
to extend the invitation and be kind.

01:05:19.958 --> 01:05:21.043
Okay. Good talk.

01:05:21.043 --> 01:05:24.504
Now, a relationship, Graham,
is a two-way street.

01:05:24.504 --> 01:05:26.173
- Mm-hmm.
- And here's the thing--

01:05:26.173 --> 01:05:28.925
harboring resentment

01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:31.178
is like eating a big bucket
of fried chicken

01:05:31.178 --> 01:05:33.388
and then going for a swim.
You sink!

01:05:33.388 --> 01:05:36.141
- No. No.
- Yes, it is.

01:05:36.141 --> 01:05:39.311
- Yes, it is. You're right. It is.
- It is. You understand now?

01:05:39.311 --> 01:05:41.355
It's a weird metaphor, but I'm getting it.

01:05:41.355 --> 01:05:42.773
Okay. Well, let me explain this to you.

01:05:42.773 --> 01:05:45.233
When your father
and I were first married,

01:05:45.233 --> 01:05:47.694
he practically lived at that dealership.

01:05:47.694 --> 01:05:51.281
I was alone 24/7 with you kids,
day and night.

01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:53.241
It was a lot. I finally had to say,

01:05:53.241 --> 01:05:57.204
"Dennis, honey, I need more than
money in the bank. I need a partner."

01:05:57.204 --> 01:06:00.082
And not just somebody to talk to,
somebody who's gonna listen to me.

01:06:00.082 --> 01:06:03.085
Somebody who understands
how to make me happy.

01:06:03.085 --> 01:06:07.047
It's-- it's not just about
achieving your goals.

01:06:08.382 --> 01:06:11.134
It's how you get there
together that's important.

01:06:13.261 --> 01:06:15.097
And I said to your father,

01:06:15.097 --> 01:06:17.391
"If you're not gonna be that man,

01:06:17.391 --> 01:06:19.851
I'm gonna go out and find that man."

01:06:19.851 --> 01:06:21.353
I said that to your Dad.

01:06:21.353 --> 01:06:23.021
- You said that to Dad?
- I meant it.

01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:26.274
What did he do?

01:06:26.274 --> 01:06:31.238
Well... [chuckles] I don't know.
It wasn't one magical thing.

01:06:31.238 --> 01:06:32.823
It was...

01:06:32.823 --> 01:06:34.366
It was everything, every day.

01:06:37.911 --> 01:06:39.538
He figured it out...

01:06:40.622 --> 01:06:42.916
because he really wanted to.

01:06:44.835 --> 01:06:48.422
So, anyway, I guess the question is...

01:06:48.422 --> 01:06:50.716
do you want to?

01:06:57.639 --> 01:06:58.765
Okay, come with me.

01:06:58.765 --> 01:07:01.643
We're gonna go through your dad's closet
for some clothes for church for you.

01:07:01.643 --> 01:07:04.146
I think there's a vintage suit in there
that should fit you.

01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:19.286
<i>♪Joy to the world,
the Lord is come! ♪</i>

01:07:19.286 --> 01:07:23.373
<i>♪ Let earth receive her King ♪</i>

01:07:23.373 --> 01:07:29.463
-  Ali.
<i>- ♪ Let every heart prepare Him room ♪</i>

fill your hearts and homes this Christmas.

01:07:55.906 --> 01:07:57.783
Hey, go-- go ahead. Go ahead.

01:07:57.783 --> 01:07:59.409
We're just gonna--
we're gonna hold back a little bit.

01:07:59.409 --> 01:08:01.453
- Go, ahead. Go ahead.
- What are you-- what are you doing?

01:08:01.453 --> 01:08:03.622
There's plenty of the little crackers
and the little wine for everyone.

01:08:03.622 --> 01:08:05.540
No, I mean why are you
making a scene?

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:06.958
I'm not making a scene, okay?

01:08:06.958 --> 01:08:10.378
Look, this morning with my Mom
was a little awkward, okay?

01:08:10.378 --> 01:08:12.839
- But last night was...
- Seriously?

01:08:12.839 --> 01:08:14.508
- No, just--
- I'm so sorry.

01:08:14.508 --> 01:08:16.134
I'm sorry. Great earrings.
Great earrings.

01:08:16.134 --> 01:08:18.053
Can you just spit it out?

01:08:18.053 --> 01:08:19.971
- Last night was amazing!

01:08:20.555 --> 01:08:21.765
- Yes?
- In church?

01:08:21.765 --> 01:08:23.308
No, at home.

01:08:25.101 --> 01:08:27.562
- What?
- Keep your voice down.

01:08:27.562 --> 01:08:30.816
- Am I wrong?

01:08:30.816 --> 01:08:32.651
- Yeah. Okay, we had sex.
- Okay.

01:08:32.651 --> 01:08:35.320
You're acting like I humped
some sense into you.

01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:37.239
Well, I don't know,
maybe you did, okay?

01:08:37.239 --> 01:08:39.825
I'm starting to realize
where we went wrong.

01:08:39.825 --> 01:08:41.743
And I think that I can forgive you.

01:08:42.494 --> 01:08:45.914
Oh, forgive me?

01:08:46.915 --> 01:08:47.958
Okay.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.836
Have you ever stopped
to think that maybe

01:08:50.836 --> 01:08:52.629
I should be the one to forgive you?

01:09:07.811 --> 01:09:10.230
Oh, I think I know what it is.
Oh, please. Oh, please.

01:09:10.230 --> 01:09:12.774
Yes! I got a Soda Stream!

01:09:12.774 --> 01:09:15.068
Oh, this is what Mude and Margie have.

01:09:15.068 --> 01:09:17.028
Oh, no.
You don't know how happy I am.

01:09:17.028 --> 01:09:18.864
Oh, Ali, you did not!

01:09:18.864 --> 01:09:21.283
How did you remember
I wanted new hockey gloves?

01:09:21.283 --> 01:09:23.410
Because you won't be quiet about it.

01:09:23.410 --> 01:09:26.329
That's fantastic.

01:09:26.329 --> 01:09:28.540
- Aww.
-  Merry Christmas everyone, really.

01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:30.250
-  Uh-oh. Who's that?

01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:32.168
I can get it.

01:09:32.168 --> 01:09:33.545
Did you invite your sister?

01:09:33.545 --> 01:09:35.297
Oh, honey, no.
I wouldn't do that to you.

01:09:35.297 --> 01:09:36.923
I wouldn't do that to any of us.

01:09:37.757 --> 01:09:40.010
-  Hey!
-  Hey, Brady!

01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:41.303
Brady, what a nice surprise.

01:09:41.303 --> 01:09:42.888
- What are you doing here?
- Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.

01:09:42.888 --> 01:09:45.307
So, I volunteer
for the Knights of Columbus,

01:09:45.307 --> 01:09:48.310
and every year we return
lost bags from the airport

01:09:48.310 --> 01:09:50.020
so that people can have a nice holiday.

01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:51.730
- Oh, my God, that's so nice.
-  Aww!

01:09:51.730 --> 01:09:56.026
And when I saw whose bag this was,
I had to take it back to G-Man.

01:09:56.026 --> 01:09:57.736
-  Thank you.
-  Ooh!

01:09:57.736 --> 01:09:59.487
That's why you're
my number one salesperson.

01:09:59.487 --> 01:10:00.572
Number one, right there!

01:10:00.572 --> 01:10:03.909
Wait! This means Graham
can give us all his gifts now!

01:10:05.869 --> 01:10:06.953
Yeah.

01:10:06.953 --> 01:10:08.788
- Did you have time to do it?
- Right in here.

01:10:08.788 --> 01:10:11.166
Oh, wow. Yay.

01:10:11.166 --> 01:10:13.293
Yay is right.

01:10:13.293 --> 01:10:14.920
But I haven't wrapped them yet, so...

01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:17.422
Oh, that's okay. Just open it up
and hand them out.

01:10:17.422 --> 01:10:19.299
-  Okay.
- We're sure they're great.

01:10:19.299 --> 01:10:20.759
Drumroll, please.

01:10:20.759 --> 01:10:23.053
I don't want to know. No, I want to know.
I really want to know.

01:10:23.053 --> 01:10:25.096
Okay. Um, well...

01:10:26.890 --> 01:10:28.558
Oh, thank you.

01:10:28.558 --> 01:10:30.268
And one for you.

01:10:30.268 --> 01:10:32.520
- Thank you, honey.
-  And you.

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:34.689
And one for you.

01:10:34.689 --> 01:10:37.025
- Oh.
-  Wow, all right.

01:10:38.109 --> 01:10:40.612
-  Neck pillows.
- Neck pillows, you got it.

01:10:40.612 --> 01:10:43.031
It's nicer than I even expected.

01:10:43.031 --> 01:10:45.492
This would be good for Maria at work.
She can sit on it.

01:10:45.492 --> 01:10:46.743
- Since the operation.
- Yeah.

01:10:46.743 --> 01:10:48.870
Well, it's for your neck, not her ass.

01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:50.080
-  Well...
- It could be for both.

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:52.415
...you can talk when you've had
a hemorrhoid removed.

01:10:52.415 --> 01:10:55.043
Oh, "Lax." Lax is the designer.

01:10:55.043 --> 01:10:57.128
Do you know-- do you know those--
those guys?

01:10:57.128 --> 01:11:00.882
- I feel like they're Italian or something?
- It's like LAX, like the airport.

01:11:00.882 --> 01:11:04.344
- Oh, right. Fancy.
- You know, it was a last-second trip,

01:11:04.344 --> 01:11:07.597
so it was either that or, uh...
one of those crossword books.

01:11:07.597 --> 01:11:09.516
It's the afterthought that counts.

01:11:09.516 --> 01:11:11.434
You know what, I'm gonna let you guys
enjoy the neck pillows.

01:11:11.434 --> 01:11:14.145
- [Jeannie No, no, no, Brady--
- Oh, no, don't go.

01:11:14.145 --> 01:11:17.232

That's very sweet of you.
I'm gonna hit the road.

01:11:20.235 --> 01:11:22.320
Jeannie makes
amazing blueberry pancakes.

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:23.905
Dad, shut your face.

01:11:23.905 --> 01:11:26.241
Brady, we're about to play some hockey.
You should totally join us.

01:11:26.241 --> 01:11:27.325
- Yeah!
- Hockey?

01:11:27.325 --> 01:11:29.452
-  Yeah.
- On Christmas?

01:11:29.452 --> 01:11:31.454
It'll be like old times, man.

01:11:31.454 --> 01:11:34.207
Yeah, it would, but--
I mean, it's Christmas.

01:11:34.207 --> 01:11:38.545
I'm sure you have other people
to see and things to do.

01:11:38.545 --> 01:11:40.755
No, no. This was my last stop.
My gear is in the car.

01:11:40.755 --> 01:11:43.299
- Of course, it is.
-  Let's do this.

01:11:43.299 --> 01:11:45.427

- See you, Brady.

01:11:49.264 --> 01:11:53.101
- Best Christmas.
-  I am so pumped about it.

01:11:53.101 --> 01:11:56.980
I can't wait to watch him humiliate you
just like when you were a kid.

01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:58.982
Great.
Whose turn to open a present?

01:11:58.982 --> 01:12:02.318
We got something for you right here,
Graham. Why don't you have that?

01:12:02.318 --> 01:12:04.112
Is this one actually for me? What is it?

01:12:04.112 --> 01:12:05.321
Well, maybe a new attitude.

01:12:05.321 --> 01:12:06.823

01:12:23.381 --> 01:12:27.010
- Just like old times, huh?
- I feel like you used to be bigger.

01:12:47.530 --> 01:12:50.784
- What was that?

Okay, help me with his helmet.
Watch his head.

No, he's unconscious.

All right, Dennis, we're gonna get
you in the back of the ambulance now.

01:16:32.588 --> 01:16:35.466
-  You're gonna be okay, Pop.

01:16:39.304 --> 01:16:40.972
-  The Stroops?
- Yeah.

Okay, great.
So, good news is you saved his life.

01:16:56.195 --> 01:16:58.239
Without the CPR, that would've been it.

01:16:59.032 --> 01:17:01.743
He's suffered a sudden cardiac arrest,

01:17:01.743 --> 01:17:03.745
probably caused
by an irregular heart rhythm.

01:17:03.745 --> 01:17:05.747
Is he awake? Can we see him?

01:17:05.747 --> 01:17:07.999
He's awake. He's doing fine.

01:17:07.999 --> 01:17:09.959
But we still have a lot of tests to do.

01:17:09.959 --> 01:17:11.377
So, maybe just one of you right now.

01:17:11.377 --> 01:17:14.213
- He's asking for Jeannie?
- Oh, that's me.

01:17:14.213 --> 01:17:15.298
- Okay.
- Come on.

01:17:24.766 --> 01:17:26.017
You saved his life.

01:17:43.409 --> 01:17:44.452
Hello.

01:17:45.453 --> 01:17:46.454
Hi, Mr. Tusk.

01:17:47.789 --> 01:17:50.958
Yes, of course I know
what day it is. It's Christmas.

01:17:53.294 --> 01:17:54.712
Yes, I know what that means.

01:17:58.091 --> 01:17:59.509
You know what?

01:18:00.676 --> 01:18:02.512
I quit. Merry Christmas.

01:18:14.482 --> 01:18:16.150
Well, that was...

01:18:17.151 --> 01:18:18.611
- Yeah.
- Wow.

01:18:18.611 --> 01:18:20.405
- Yep.
- Okay.

01:18:21.197 --> 01:18:22.198
Okay.

01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:27.829
I don't have a job, but that's okay.

01:18:27.829 --> 01:18:29.122
Are... are you sure?

01:18:29.122 --> 01:18:30.706
Yep.

01:18:30.706 --> 01:18:31.791
Yeah.

01:18:31.791 --> 01:18:35.420
Yeah, I gave that job way too much time.

01:18:37.713 --> 01:18:41.968
I-I should've been spending time
with my Dad and my family

01:18:41.968 --> 01:18:43.261
and the people that I love.

01:18:44.345 --> 01:18:47.014
If he had died, I just, I...

01:18:47.014 --> 01:18:49.475
I never would've stopped thinking
about all the time I wasted.

01:18:52.145 --> 01:18:54.439
I just, I give him such a hard time,
and he's just the best.

01:18:54.439 --> 01:18:56.441
He's always trying

01:18:56.441 --> 01:18:58.359
to just make his family happy.

01:19:00.528 --> 01:19:03.072
- I'm such a horrible person.
- No, no.

01:19:04.532 --> 01:19:07.910
You're not. You're really...

01:19:09.745 --> 01:19:10.997
You're really not.

01:19:15.084 --> 01:19:16.085
Listen...

01:19:18.754 --> 01:19:22.467
this whole stupid game
has gotta stop. It's gone too far.

01:19:22.467 --> 01:19:27.388
You almost lost a parent.
I know what that's like.

01:19:32.768 --> 01:19:34.270
They're your family, Graham.

01:19:37.064 --> 01:19:38.107
You win.

01:19:40.401 --> 01:19:44.322
And I'm sorry that I wasn't honest

01:19:44.322 --> 01:19:46.032
when I was becoming unhappy.

01:19:50.453 --> 01:19:51.454
I was afraid.

01:19:53.206 --> 01:19:57.335
I thought if I told you the truth,
you would walk away.

01:19:59.712 --> 01:20:00.713
So I did it first.

01:20:08.971 --> 01:20:09.972
I'm sorry.

01:20:11.599 --> 01:20:12.642
I screwed up.

01:20:13.643 --> 01:20:14.810
We both did.

01:20:22.610 --> 01:20:24.028
Can we forgive each other?

01:20:41.462 --> 01:20:43.589
You're gonna
find someone amazing...

01:20:44.674 --> 01:20:45.675
who deserves you.

01:20:51.264 --> 01:20:52.265
You, too.

01:21:01.399 --> 01:21:02.984
Dennis, did you
take your pills, sweet pea?

01:21:02.984 --> 01:21:04.068
Yes, honeybun.

01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:09.407
Okay, guys.

01:21:09.407 --> 01:21:13.202
Stroops, it's time I hit the road.

01:21:13.202 --> 01:21:15.621
-  Already?
- Yeah.

01:21:18.708 --> 01:21:20.501
Okay. Oh...

01:21:20.501 --> 01:21:22.753
- Thank you for coming, honey.
- Oh, thank you.

01:21:24.171 --> 01:21:26.173
You know it's not Christmas
here without you.

01:21:26.173 --> 01:21:27.842
Aw, I feel the same.

01:21:29.844 --> 01:21:31.512
So good to have you here.

01:21:32.221 --> 01:21:33.723
Thank you.
You take care of yourself, okay?

01:21:33.723 --> 01:21:35.141
- I will. I promise.
- Take it easy.

01:21:35.141 --> 01:21:36.225
I will.

01:21:36.225 --> 01:21:38.436
Oh, he's got Nurse Graham
here for another few days.

01:21:38.436 --> 01:21:40.980
-  Don't be a stranger.
- Okay.

01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:44.650
Well, there's always next Christmas
or Valentine's Day...

01:21:44.650 --> 01:21:46.777
Oh. [chuckles] We'll see.

01:21:50.156 --> 01:21:51.782
I guess this is goodbye again.

01:21:51.782 --> 01:21:53.075
I guess it is.

01:21:57.204 --> 01:21:58.289
Oh.

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:06.797
Okay. Well...

01:22:09.133 --> 01:22:11.135
Thank you all for everything.

01:22:12.678 --> 01:22:14.805
Okay.

01:22:15.931 --> 01:22:17.016
Merry Christmas.

01:22:20.353 --> 01:22:21.854
I love you all.

01:22:21.854 --> 01:22:24.815
We love you, too.

01:22:27.151 --> 01:22:29.070
- Bye.
-  Bye.

01:22:47.171 --> 01:22:48.381
Empty.

01:22:48.381 --> 01:22:49.674
Good one, Mind.

01:22:49.674 --> 01:22:52.385
Can I pass?
This is depressing.

01:22:53.427 --> 01:22:55.388
Yeah, where'd our Christmas spirit go?

01:22:55.971 --> 01:22:57.973
With Ali, back to L.A.

01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:01.268
Yeah. I didn't want
to say anything, but...

01:23:01.268 --> 01:23:02.353
I can text her to come back.

01:23:02.353 --> 01:23:03.854
Jeannie and I could call
from the landline.

01:23:03.854 --> 01:23:05.898
Everybody always picks up
when we call from the landline.

01:23:05.898 --> 01:23:07.191
Guys, she's not coming back.

01:23:08.734 --> 01:23:12.113
I screwed up. I gotta talk to her.
I gotta talk to her in person.

01:23:12.113 --> 01:23:14.699
- What? At the airport?
-  Yep, at the airport.

01:23:14.699 --> 01:23:16.200
Okay. Well, we're coming with you.

01:23:17.159 --> 01:23:19.078
- What? Why?
- Because we love her.

01:23:19.078 --> 01:23:20.162
Not how you love her.

01:23:20.162 --> 01:23:23.457
Well, sometimes after one or two drinks
I think about it, but it's not that way.

01:23:23.457 --> 01:23:25.584
Okay. Because
we can use the carpool lane.

01:23:25.584 --> 01:23:28.754
Ah! Let's take the Datsun!
It's faster than-- than Rudolph!

01:23:28.754 --> 01:23:30.631
- Okay. You're not driving.
- Okay, you drive.

01:23:30.631 --> 01:23:33.467
- No, guys. I'll drive. Let's go, come on.
- All right. Let's do it.

01:23:33.467 --> 01:23:35.594
- Okay. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
- Go, go, go!

01:23:49.942 --> 01:23:51.360
Those pills are making my feet fat.

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:53.404
- Come on, okay, we're getting there.
- You wanna step in there.

01:23:53.404 --> 01:23:55.573
You guys wanna come?

01:23:55.573 --> 01:23:58.117
Yeah. We're ready.
To the Datsun!

01:23:58.117 --> 01:23:59.201
It's tight in the car. Come on.

01:23:59.201 --> 01:24:00.828
- Everybody get in.
- Okay.

01:24:00.828 --> 01:24:02.663
-  We can do it.
-  Go, go, go!

01:24:02.663 --> 01:24:04.081
-  Going, going.
-  Come on.

01:24:04.081 --> 01:24:05.458
I don't wanna be in the middle.

01:24:05.458 --> 01:24:07.042
Oh, my God, get in the car!

01:24:10.254 --> 01:24:13.716
All right. Everybody in. Everybody in.
Start her up. Start her up.

01:24:13.716 --> 01:24:15.843
- Okay, here we go.
- Go, go, go!

01:24:17.219 --> 01:24:19.513
- Okay. Press on the gas. Press on the gas.
- Now, now!

01:24:19.513 --> 01:24:23.434
- I am! I am!
- Okay. Third time's the charm, baby!

01:24:23.434 --> 01:24:24.643
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

01:24:27.021 --> 01:24:28.606
- No!
- Okay.

01:24:28.606 --> 01:24:31.734
- To the wagon!
- To the wagon!

01:24:31.734 --> 01:24:35.154
Move it, move it, move it.
Get out, Elliot!

01:24:35.154 --> 01:24:37.573
-  Mom, I got ya. Come on.
-  Oh. Thanks, honey.

01:24:37.573 --> 01:24:39.784
-  Come on, come on. I know.
-  I'm so glad I took Pilates.

01:24:56.717 --> 01:24:59.345
- Hi. I just--
- Hi. I just--

01:25:00.054 --> 01:25:03.140
- I wanted-- I was coming to--
- Okay. I-- no, I just--

01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:05.100
- Can I go?
- Okay.

01:25:06.227 --> 01:25:08.729
Wow. I thought I was gonna have
a couple of minutes in the car

01:25:08.729 --> 01:25:10.231
to figure out exactly how to say this--

01:25:10.231 --> 01:25:11.315
Just say it, honey.

01:25:11.315 --> 01:25:12.399
Okay.

01:25:14.568 --> 01:25:18.113
- Ali, I'm an idiot.
- He's such an idiot.

01:25:18.113 --> 01:25:20.157
My priorities were so out of whack.

01:25:20.157 --> 01:25:21.700
- It was like, "What's important?"
- It's super whack.

01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:23.661
"I don't know what's important.
This, that--"

01:25:23.661 --> 01:25:25.704
Okay, guys, can we...?

01:25:25.704 --> 01:25:26.831
What's up? You wanna-- okay.

01:25:26.831 --> 01:25:29.708
- I'll take this one.
- Your thing. Hey-- good luck.

01:25:29.708 --> 01:25:30.835
Thank you.

01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:33.921
Ali...

01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:37.007
all I want is to figure
things out with you.

01:25:38.425 --> 01:25:42.012
And if you let me,
I promise I will do anything I can

01:25:42.012 --> 01:25:44.056
to be there for you,

01:25:44.056 --> 01:25:46.976
to make you laugh,
to make you smile.

01:25:46.976 --> 01:25:49.895
I will be there every day.

01:25:51.230 --> 01:25:54.775
This Christmas was,
um, a little bit crazy.

01:25:57.152 --> 01:25:59.446
But I can't imagine
another Christmas without you.

01:26:00.948 --> 01:26:03.117
Ali, you're a part of this family,

01:26:03.117 --> 01:26:05.953
and if you gave them the choice,
they would probably choose you over me.

01:26:05.953 --> 01:26:09.373
So, I'd prefer
we didn't give them that option.

01:26:11.166 --> 01:26:12.835
I'm so crazy in love with you.

01:26:14.336 --> 01:26:15.838
Can you give me another chance?

01:26:23.721 --> 01:26:25.848
I just came back 'cause I forgot my phone.

01:26:28.183 --> 01:26:29.184
Oh.

01:26:33.063 --> 01:26:35.107
Oh, okay.

01:26:35.107 --> 01:26:38.277
I'm just kidding.

01:26:40.237 --> 01:26:41.238
I hate you.

01:26:41.238 --> 01:26:43.324
I love you.

01:26:46.994 --> 01:26:50.539
Aw.

01:26:56.086 --> 01:26:57.171
Okay.

01:26:57.171 --> 01:26:59.381
It's okay. It's okay.
We're not looking.

01:26:59.381 --> 01:27:02.301
Ohh!

01:27:02.301 --> 01:27:03.802
Hey, hey! Stop!

01:27:03.802 --> 01:27:06.221
Oh, oh, that's Homer!
It's Mrs. Snyder's dog.

01:27:06.221 --> 01:27:08.057
Bad dog! Bad dog!

01:27:08.057 --> 01:27:10.351
-  What?

01:27:10.351 --> 01:27:12.519
-  Dad, careful!
-  Slow it down.

01:27:12.519 --> 01:27:13.938
Dude, he's so fast.

01:27:15.898 --> 01:27:17.232
-  Dennis.
-  Oh, we gotta see this.

01:27:17.232 --> 01:27:19.693
I... slow down!

01:27:19.693 --> 01:27:21.487
Oh, the whole time!

01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:25.449
- Oh.
- Come on.

01:27:25.449 --> 01:27:26.533
What?

01:27:26.533 --> 01:27:29.411
He's really tearing through
those things. Oh, that's a bad dog.

01:27:29.411 --> 01:27:30.496
Oh, I can't watch.

01:27:30.496 --> 01:27:32.790
Well, we got plenty
of baby Jesuses, Mom.

01:27:32.790 --> 01:27:35.292
-  Oh, my goodness.
-  Oh.

01:27:35.292 --> 01:27:37.127
You know, maybe he's just hungry.

01:27:37.127 --> 01:27:39.463
- Yeah. Make him a snack, for sure.
- I should fix him something. I will.

01:27:39.463 --> 01:27:41.131
- He's definitely hungry.
- I'll fix something for you, honey.

01:27:41.131 --> 01:27:42.257
Make him some blueberry pancakes.

01:27:42.257 --> 01:27:43.384
Oh, I think it's eatin' the duck.

01:27:54.478 --> 01:27:56.480
-  Merry Christmas!

01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:59.858
Your first L.A. Christmas!
I'm so excited.

01:27:59.858 --> 01:28:02.069
- This is Quinn.
- Hi.

01:28:02.069 --> 01:28:03.487
I've heard so much about you.

01:28:03.487 --> 01:28:05.823
Isn't she something? We like her
so much better than Heather.

01:28:05.823 --> 01:28:07.533
- Dad! You can't say that.
- I'm sorry, but we do.

01:28:07.533 --> 01:28:10.244
- Well, I'm sorry. It's just true.
- Thank you.

01:28:10.244 --> 01:28:12.538
Welcome. Welcome to the family.
Welcome to L.A.

01:28:12.538 --> 01:28:15.290
- Come in.
-  Wait a minute, where's Graham?

01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:16.709
What? Is he still asleep?

01:28:16.709 --> 01:28:19.128
He said he had to get some work done.
But he'll be back soon.

01:28:19.128 --> 01:28:21.171
No, he's not working at Christmas.

01:28:21.171 --> 01:28:24.341
He's his own boss, finally.
He can make his own hours!

01:28:25.551 --> 01:28:26.760
Uh-oh. What's that?

01:28:28.804 --> 01:28:30.305
What?

01:28:32.933 --> 01:28:35.227
Okay. Wha-- wait a second.

01:28:35.227 --> 01:28:37.855
Hey, is that...?

01:28:37.855 --> 01:28:41.650
Yeah. I mean, it's just
a little starter truck to get you going.

01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:44.319
Graham...

01:28:44.319 --> 01:28:47.072
this is the cutest little truck
I've ever seen.

01:28:47.072 --> 01:28:48.157
Thank you.

01:28:48.157 --> 01:28:52.411
Look at these adorable...!

01:28:52.411 --> 01:28:53.704
Oh, it's a puffer fish!

01:28:57.332 --> 01:29:00.127
- This is amazing.
- Well, I'm sorry it took so long.

01:29:00.127 --> 01:29:02.755
Oh. Well, better late than never.

01:29:02.755 --> 01:29:04.548
- Merry Christmas.
- Aww, Merry Christmas.

01:29:04.548 --> 01:29:06.050
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:29:06.050 --> 01:29:09.845
And I should probably let you know
that I am engaged.

01:29:09.845 --> 01:29:11.638
Oh, my God!

01:29:11.638 --> 01:29:13.474
My eyes!

01:29:13.474 --> 01:29:16.268
He has great taste,
and I bet he is gorgeous.

01:29:16.268 --> 01:29:17.561
Yeah, not much behind those blue eyes.

01:29:17.561 --> 01:29:20.397
I don't mean to be pushy,
but it's game night. Come, come.

01:29:20.397 --> 01:29:22.149
- All right, let's go, let's go.
- Game night!

01:29:24.359 --> 01:29:25.527
- It really turned out great.
- It turned out great, I know.

01:29:25.527 --> 01:29:27.946
- Don't take it too far.
- Oh, yes. She really does.

01:29:27.946 --> 01:29:30.491
- That paint job really came out nice.
- I can't wait to see the house.

01:29:30.491 --> 01:29:32.284
It's like a-- what color is it?
Like an off-white kind of a thing?

01:29:32.284 --> 01:29:34.453
- Yeah, eggshell. Something like that.
- No, no, you should be scared.

01:29:36.288 --> 01:29:38.791
- Oh, wow, you got a whole bunch.
- I got it, I got it.

01:29:38.791 --> 01:29:41.085
I'm making blueberry pancakes this year.

01:29:41.085 --> 01:29:43.754
So, Mom, has been smoking
marijuana every night.

01:29:43.754 --> 01:29:45.839
I mean, it was all downhill after dinner.

01:29:45.839 --> 01:29:47.966
It really kinda got out of hand.

01:29:54.181 --> 01:29:56.225
- Heather?
- Guess who's here?

01:29:56.225 --> 01:29:58.644
Heather, I'm so glad you could make it.

01:29:58.644 --> 01:30:00.312
You know, we stay in touch--

01:30:00.312 --> 01:30:01.939
DMs, Wordle.

01:30:01.939 --> 01:30:03.857
Even sent her an edible arrangement.

01:30:03.857 --> 01:30:06.110
Merry Christmas.

01:30:06.110 --> 01:30:08.570
Graham... what the fu--
