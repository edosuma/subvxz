WEBVTT

01:13.282 --> 01:15.284
I can't let you out, Hedwig.

01:15.450 --> 01:18.996
I'm not allowed to use
magic outside of school.

01:19.454 --> 01:23.333
- Besides, if Uncle Vernon...
- Harry Potter!

01:25.169 --> 01:26.795
Now you've done it.

01:31.633 --> 01:34.303
He's in there. Vernon?

01:36.638 --> 01:40.434
I'm warning you, if you can't control
that bloody bird, it'll have to go.

01:40.976 --> 01:42.394
But she's bored.

01:42.561 --> 01:47.065
If I could only let her
out for an hour or two.

01:47.232 --> 01:51.195
So you can send secret messages to
your freaky little friends? No, sir.

01:51.361 --> 01:56.491
But I haven't had any messages
from any of my friends.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.327
Not one...

01:58.744 --> 02:00.204
...all summer.

02:00.370 --> 02:03.624
Who would want to be
friends with you?

02:05.876 --> 02:08.336
I should think you'd be
a little more grateful.

02:08.503 --> 02:12.007
We've raised you since you were a baby,
given you the food off our table...

02:12.174 --> 02:14.301
...even let you have
Dudley's second bedroom...

02:14.468 --> 02:17.012
...purely out of the
goodness of our hearts.

02:17.429 --> 02:19.681
Not now. It's for when
the Masons arrive.

02:20.140 --> 02:23.185
Which should be any minute.

02:23.852 --> 02:26.688
Now, let's go over our
schedule once again, shall we?

02:26.855 --> 02:28.774
Petunia, when the Masons
arrive, you will be...?

02:28.941 --> 02:32.653
In the lounge, waiting to welcome
them graciously to our home.

02:32.819 --> 02:36.740
- Good. And, Dudley, you will be...?
- I'll be waiting to open the door.

02:36.907 --> 02:38.825
Excellent.

02:43.372 --> 02:45.207
And you?

02:45.791 --> 02:50.170
I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise
and pretending that I don't exist.

02:50.337 --> 02:52.047
Too right, you will.

02:52.214 --> 02:55.717
With any luck, this could be the day I
make the biggest deal of my career...

02:55.884 --> 02:59.429
...and you will not mess it up.

03:10.566 --> 03:15.404
Harry Potter, such
an honor it is.

03:18.282 --> 03:23.203
- Who are you? - Dobby,
sir. Dobby the house-elf.

03:23.954 --> 03:25.289
Not to be rude or anything...

03:25.455 --> 03:29.418
...but this isn't a great time for me
to have a house-elf in my bedroom.

03:29.585 --> 03:32.087
Yes, sir. Dobby understands.

03:32.254 --> 03:35.382
It's just that Dobby has
come to tell you...

03:35.549 --> 03:40.387
It is difficult, sir. Dobby
wonders where to begin.

03:40.554 --> 03:46.351
- Why don't you sit down?
- Sit down? Sit down?

03:49.605 --> 03:54.109
Dobby, I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to offend you or anything.

03:54.276 --> 03:56.445
Offend Dobby?

03:56.612 --> 03:58.947
Dobby has heard of
your greatness, sir...

03:59.114 --> 04:04.912
...but never has he been asked to sit
down by a wizard, like an equal.

04:05.829 --> 04:08.457
You can't have met many
decent wizards then.

04:08.624 --> 04:11.043
No, I haven't.

04:11.210 --> 04:13.962
That was an awful thing to say.

04:14.630 --> 04:18.091
- Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!
- Stop, Dobby. Dobby, shush.

04:18.257 --> 04:19.635
Dobby, please, stop.

04:24.139 --> 04:26.767
Don't mind that.
It's just the cat.

04:28.685 --> 04:33.232
- Bad Dobby. - Stop! Stop,
Dobby. Please, be quiet.

04:33.398 --> 04:35.692
Are you all right?

04:36.443 --> 04:39.321
Dobby had to punish
himself, sir.

04:39.488 --> 04:42.699
Dobby almost spoke ill
of his family, sir.

04:42.866 --> 04:46.828
- Your family? - The wizard
family Dobby serves, sir.

04:46.995 --> 04:49.998
Dobby is bound to serve
one family forever.

04:50.165 --> 04:52.709
If they ever knew
Dobby was here...

04:54.336 --> 05:00.133
But Dobby had to come. Dobby has to
protect Harry Potter. To warn him.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.594
Harry Potter must not go back...

05:02.761 --> 05:07.474
...to Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry this year.

05:07.641 --> 05:12.813
There is a plot, a plot to make
most terrible things happen.

05:12.980 --> 05:16.316
What terrible things?
Who's plotting them?

05:17.192 --> 05:19.653
Can't say.

05:20.112 --> 05:25.826
- Okay, I understand. You can't
say. - Don't make me talk. L...

05:27.244 --> 05:30.539
- Dobby. Dobby, put the
lamp down. - Bad Dobby.

05:30.706 --> 05:34.751
So when they arrive
at the ninth hole...

05:37.337 --> 05:39.923
Give me the lamp.

05:41.633 --> 05:44.052
Dobby, stop!

05:46.221 --> 05:49.224
- Let me go.
- Get in there and keep quiet.

05:49.391 --> 05:53.437
- What the devil are you doing
up here? - I was just...

05:53.604 --> 05:56.356
You just ruined the punch line
of my Japanese golfer joke.

05:56.940 --> 05:58.358
Sorry.

05:59.902 --> 06:03.989
One more sound and you'll wish
you'd never been born, boy.

06:04.156 --> 06:07.951
- And fix that door.
- Yes, sir.

06:10.245 --> 06:11.872
See why I've got to go back?

06:12.039 --> 06:15.792
I don't belong here. I belong
in your world, at Hogwarts.

06:15.959 --> 06:20.589
- It's the only place I've got friends. -
Friends who don't write to Harry Potter?

06:20.756 --> 06:23.675
Well, I expect they've been...

06:23.842 --> 06:28.514
Hang on. How do you know my friends
haven't been writing to me?

06:28.931 --> 06:32.059
Harry Potter mustn't
be angry with Dobby.

06:32.226 --> 06:36.438
Dobby hoped if Harry Potter thought
his friends had forgotten him...

06:36.605 --> 06:40.275
...Harry Potter might not want
to go back to school, sir.

06:41.109 --> 06:45.864
- Give me those. Now.
- No!

06:58.168 --> 07:01.463
Dobby, get back here.

07:04.633 --> 07:07.970
Dobby, please, no.

07:08.136 --> 07:12.307
Harry Potter must say he's
not going back to school.

07:12.641 --> 07:15.102
I can't. Hogwarts is my home.

07:15.769 --> 07:21.358
Then Dobby must do it, sir,
for Harry Potter's own good.

07:21.525 --> 07:26.530
It spread as far as the eye could see,
all over the floor of this building.

07:26.697 --> 07:28.657
One plumber said, "Look
at all that water."

07:28.824 --> 07:31.827
The second plumber said, "Yes,
and that's just the top of it."

07:43.589 --> 07:47.676
I'm so sorry. It's my nephew.
He's very disturbed.

07:47.843 --> 07:52.181
Meeting strangers upsets him.
That's why I kept him upstairs.

08:03.901 --> 08:06.361
You're never going
back to that school.

08:06.528 --> 08:11.575
You're never going to see those
freaky friends of yours again. Never!

08:57.746 --> 08:58.872
Hiya, Harry.

08:59.957 --> 09:04.419
Ron. Fred. George. What
are you all doing here?

09:04.586 --> 09:08.465
Rescuing you, of course. Now,
come on, get your trunk.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.890
You better stand back.

09:17.307 --> 09:19.434
Let's go.

09:24.189 --> 09:26.108
- What was that?
- What was it?

09:28.402 --> 09:30.612
Potter!

09:30.779 --> 09:32.447
Dad, what's going on?

09:35.701 --> 09:36.743
Go. Go. Go.

09:36.910 --> 09:37.953
Dad, hurry up.

09:39.788 --> 09:41.999
- Come on.
- Come on, Harry, hurry up.

09:43.959 --> 09:45.794
Petunia, he's escaping!

09:48.005 --> 09:49.506
- I've got you, Harry.
- Come here!

09:49.965 --> 09:51.800
- Let go of me!
- No, boy!

09:51.967 --> 09:54.970
You and that bloody pigeon
aren't going anywhere.

09:55.137 --> 09:56.763
- Get off!
- Drive!

09:56.930 --> 09:58.807
- Right.
- Right!

09:58.974 --> 10:00.642
No! No! No! No!

10:05.022 --> 10:06.815
Dad!

10:15.949 --> 10:17.451
Damn.

10:21.580 --> 10:25.459
By the way, Harry,
Happy Birthday.

10:51.777 --> 10:53.570
Come on.

10:56.281 --> 10:58.200
Okay, come on.

10:59.034 --> 11:01.245
Okay, come on.

11:09.461 --> 11:13.549
- Think it'd be all right if we had
some? - Yeah, Mum will never know.

11:30.232 --> 11:33.443
It's not much, but it's home.

11:33.610 --> 11:35.904
I think it's brilliant.

11:36.655 --> 11:40.409
Where have you been?

11:40.826 --> 11:43.871
Harry, how wonderful
to see you, dear.

11:44.037 --> 11:47.624
Beds empty. No note. Car gone.

11:47.791 --> 11:50.794
You could have died. You
could have been seen.

11:51.378 --> 11:54.006
Of course, I don't blame
you, Harry, dear.

11:54.173 --> 11:57.217
They were starving him, Mum.
There were bars on his window.

11:57.384 --> 12:02.139
Well, you best hope I don't put bars
on your window, Ronald Weasley.

12:02.306 --> 12:04.433
Come on, Harry, time for
a spot of breakfast.

12:05.601 --> 12:08.353
Here we are, Harry.
Now, tuck in.

12:08.520 --> 12:12.107
That's it. There we go.

12:12.608 --> 12:16.111
- Mummy, have you seen my jumper?
- Yes, dear, it was on the cat.

12:16.695 --> 12:18.363
Hello.

12:22.701 --> 12:24.077
What did I do?

12:24.244 --> 12:28.832
Ginny. She's been talking about you
all summer. A bit annoying, really.

12:28.999 --> 12:31.627
- Morning, Weasleys.
- Morning, Dad.

12:32.586 --> 12:36.340
- What a night. Nine
raids. Nine! - Raids?

12:36.798 --> 12:40.469
Dad works in the Ministry of Magic, in
the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.

12:40.802 --> 12:43.972
Dad loves Muggles, thinks
they're fascinating.

12:44.139 --> 12:46.350
Well, now.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.478
And who are you?

12:50.270 --> 12:53.815
Sorry, sir. I'm Harry, sir.
Harry Potter.

12:54.233 --> 12:57.110
Good Lord. Are you really?

12:57.653 --> 13:01.990
Well, Ron has told us all about you,
of course. When did he get here?

13:02.157 --> 13:03.659
This morning.

13:04.076 --> 13:09.039
Your sons flew that enchanted car of
yours to Surrey and back last night.

13:09.289 --> 13:12.668
Did you really? How did it go?

13:12.835 --> 13:17.673
I mean... That was very wrong
indeed, boys. Very wrong of you.

13:19.007 --> 13:22.845
Now, Harry, you must
know all about Muggles.

13:23.095 --> 13:27.140
Tell me, what exactly is the
function of a rubber duck?

13:31.728 --> 13:34.481
Well, that'll be
Errol with the post.

13:40.237 --> 13:43.031
Fetch it, will you,
Percy, please?

13:43.365 --> 13:46.577
- Errol.
- He's always doing that.

13:48.245 --> 13:52.207
Look, it's our Hogwarts letters.
They've sent us Harry's as well.

13:52.374 --> 13:55.419
Dumbledore must know you're here.
Doesn't miss a trick, that man.

13:55.586 --> 13:57.546
- No.
- This lot won't come cheap.

13:57.713 --> 14:02.050
- The spell books alone are
expensive. - We'll manage.

14:02.759 --> 14:07.014
There's only one place we're going
to get all of this. Diagon Alley.

14:08.265 --> 14:09.641
Right.

14:09.808 --> 14:11.935
Here we are, Harry.
You go first, dear.

14:12.102 --> 14:15.063
But Harry's never traveled
by Floo powder before, Mum.

14:15.230 --> 14:16.273
Floo powder?

14:16.440 --> 14:20.736
You go first, Ron, so that Harry
can see how it's done. Yes.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.238
In you go.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.282
That's it.

14:28.785 --> 14:30.496
Diagon Alley.

14:36.543 --> 14:40.047
You see? It's quite easy, dear.
Don't be afraid. Come on.

14:41.798 --> 14:43.008
Come on.

14:43.175 --> 14:46.386
In you go. That's it.
Mind your head.

14:46.553 --> 14:49.973
That's right. Now,
take your Floo powder.

14:51.517 --> 14:53.977
That's it, very good.

14:54.144 --> 14:58.482
Now, don't forget to speak
very, very clearly.

15:00.317 --> 15:02.694
Diagonally.

15:09.159 --> 15:11.578
- What did he say, dear?
- Diagonally.

15:11.745 --> 15:12.830
I thought he did.

16:37.831 --> 16:43.129
- Not lost, are you, my dear? - I'm
fine, thank you. I was just going...

16:44.296 --> 16:48.800
Come with us. We'll help
you find your way back.

16:49.343 --> 16:51.678
- No. Please...
- Harry?

16:51.845 --> 16:52.930
Hagrid!

16:53.096 --> 16:56.099
What do you think you're
doing down here? Come on.

17:01.897 --> 17:07.152
You're a mess, Harry. Skulking
around Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place.

17:07.319 --> 17:11.323
Don't want no one to see you there.
People will think you're up to no good.

17:11.490 --> 17:13.742
I was lost, I...

17:13.909 --> 17:16.869
Hang on. What were you
doing down there then?

17:17.037 --> 17:22.166
Me? I was... I was looking for
Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.

17:22.334 --> 17:25.253
They're ruining all
the school cabbages.

17:30.676 --> 17:32.845
Harry. Hagrid.

17:33.053 --> 17:34.471
Hello, Hermione.

17:34.847 --> 17:37.474
- It's so good to see you.
- It's great to see you too.

17:38.141 --> 17:40.727
What did you do to your glasses?

17:40.894 --> 17:43.772
<i>Oculus Reparo.</i>

17:47.234 --> 17:49.987
I definitely need to
remember that one.

17:50.153 --> 17:53.866
You'll be all right now then,
Harry? Right. I'll leave you to it.

17:54.032 --> 17:55.492
- Okay, bye.
- Thank you. Bye.

17:55.784 --> 17:57.661
Come on, everyone's
been so worried.

18:08.380 --> 18:09.506
Harry.

18:09.673 --> 18:12.885
Thank goodness. We'd hoped you'd
only gone one grate too far.

18:13.051 --> 18:15.888
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart.

18:16.054 --> 18:18.348
Here he is.

18:22.352 --> 18:23.979
Mum fancies him.

18:24.146 --> 18:27.399
Make way there, please. Let
me by, madam. Thank you.

18:27.608 --> 18:31.028
<i>Excuse me, little girl. This
is for the Daily Prophet.</i>

18:35.199 --> 18:38.076
It can't be. Harry Potter?

18:39.620 --> 18:41.497
Harry Potter!

18:41.663 --> 18:42.873
Excuse me, madam.

18:44.875 --> 18:48.712
Nice big smile, Harry. Together,
you and I rate the front page.

18:48.879 --> 18:52.049
Ladies and gentlemen, what an
extraordinary moment this is.

18:52.466 --> 18:55.636
When young Harry stepped into
Flourish and Blotts this morning...

18:55.802 --> 18:59.890
<i>...to purchase my
autobiography, Magical Me...</i>

19:03.393 --> 19:06.271
...which, incidentally, is
currently celebrating...

19:06.438 --> 19:11.276
<i>...its 27th week atop the Daily
Prophet bestseller list...</i>

19:11.443 --> 19:15.948
...he had no idea that he
would, in fact, be leaving...

19:17.115 --> 19:22.037
...with my entire
collected works...

19:22.621 --> 19:24.832
...free of charge.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.253
Now, ladies?

19:29.461 --> 19:32.589
Harry, now you give me those,
and I'll get them signed.

19:32.756 --> 19:36.260
All of you wait outside.
That's it.

19:45.561 --> 19:48.063
I'll bet you loved that,
didn't you, Potter?

19:48.230 --> 19:52.734
Famous Harry Potter. Can't go into a
bookshop without making the front page.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.070
Leave him alone.

19:55.237 --> 19:58.740
Look, Potter. You've got
yourself a girlfriend.

19:58.907 --> 20:02.953
Now, now, Draco, play nicely.

20:03.370 --> 20:04.580
Mr. Potter.

20:07.040 --> 20:11.003
Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last.

20:11.170 --> 20:13.380
Forgive me.

20:14.756 --> 20:16.800
Your scar is legend.

20:17.342 --> 20:19.595
As, of course, is the
wizard who gave it to you.

20:19.928 --> 20:22.097
Voldemort killed my parents.

20:24.183 --> 20:27.644
He was nothing more
than a murderer.

20:28.687 --> 20:31.607
You must be very brave
to mention his name.

20:32.274 --> 20:33.609
Or very foolish.

20:34.026 --> 20:37.571
Fear of a name only increases
fear of the thing itself.

20:39.156 --> 20:42.451
And you must be Miss Granger.

20:45.287 --> 20:49.583
Yes, Draco has told me all
about you. And your parents.

20:54.213 --> 20:57.674
Muggles, aren't they?

21:00.636 --> 21:05.724
Let me see. Red hair,
vacant expressions...

21:07.142 --> 21:10.479
...tatty, secondhand book.

21:10.687 --> 21:14.024
You must be the Weasleys.

21:14.483 --> 21:16.485
It's mad in here.
Let's go outside.

21:16.652 --> 21:20.364
- Well, well, well.
- Weasley senior. - Lucius.

21:20.572 --> 21:25.244
Busy time at the Ministry,
Arthur, all those extra raids?

21:25.410 --> 21:27.746
I do hope they're
paying you overtime...

21:27.913 --> 21:31.083
...but judging by the state
of this, I'd say not.

21:32.876 --> 21:36.630
What's the use in being a
disgrace to the name of wizard...

21:36.797 --> 21:38.882
...if they don't even
pay you well for it?

21:39.174 --> 21:44.179
We have a very different idea about what
disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy.

21:44.429 --> 21:46.223
Clearly.

21:48.308 --> 21:52.020
Associating with Muggles.

21:56.233 --> 22:00.821
And I thought your family
could sink no lower.

22:04.116 --> 22:06.910
I'll see you at work.

22:11.081 --> 22:13.417
See you at school.

22:21.258 --> 22:23.927
- 10:58, come on. - The train
will be leaving any moment.

22:24.094 --> 22:27.389
Fred, George, Percy, you first.

22:32.978 --> 22:34.605
Okay.

22:40.652 --> 22:42.404
After you, dear.

22:44.573 --> 22:47.784
Come on, Ginny, we'll
get you a seat. Hurry.

22:49.077 --> 22:51.163
Let's go.

23:05.093 --> 23:08.263
- What do you two think
you're doing? - Sorry.

23:08.680 --> 23:11.683
Lost control of the trolley.

23:13.018 --> 23:15.354
- Why can't we get through?
- I don't know.

23:15.521 --> 23:18.899
The gateway has sealed
itself for some reason.

23:20.275 --> 23:24.196
The train leaves at exactly
11:00. We've missed it.

23:24.363 --> 23:27.741
Harry, if we can't
get through...

23:28.033 --> 23:30.702
...maybe Mum and Dad
can't get back.

23:31.662 --> 23:35.123
Maybe we should just go
and wait by the car.

23:36.166 --> 23:37.501
The car.

23:49.012 --> 23:51.181
Ron, I should tell you...

23:51.348 --> 23:55.143
...most Muggles aren't accustomed
to seeing a flying car.

23:55.310 --> 23:56.395
Right.

23:56.687 --> 23:57.729
Okay.

24:15.038 --> 24:18.333
Oh, no! The Invisibility
Booster must be faulty.

24:18.792 --> 24:21.920
Come on, then. Let's go lower.
We need to find the train.

24:22.087 --> 24:23.380
Okay.

24:34.308 --> 24:36.351
All we need to do is
catch up with the train.

24:36.518 --> 24:38.187
We can't be far behind.

24:40.189 --> 24:42.900
- Do you hear that?
- We must be getting close.

24:43.275 --> 24:45.444
Hold on.

25:11.762 --> 25:13.931
Harry!

25:16.558 --> 25:18.393
Hold on!

25:21.730 --> 25:24.233
Take my hand!

25:28.487 --> 25:29.738
Hold on!

25:29.905 --> 25:33.492
I'm trying. Your
hand's all sweaty.

25:46.088 --> 25:49.383
- I think we found the train.
- Yeah.

26:06.066 --> 26:07.317
Welcome home.

26:23.458 --> 26:24.668
Up! Up!

26:25.627 --> 26:27.796
It's not working!

26:31.717 --> 26:34.303
Up! Ron, mind that tree!

26:37.556 --> 26:39.683
Stop! Stop! Stop!

27:02.789 --> 27:07.419
- My wand. Look at my wand. -
Be thankful it's not your neck.

27:09.046 --> 27:12.049
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

27:47.501 --> 27:49.628
Come on, go! Fast!

28:23.996 --> 28:26.790
Scabbers, you're okay.

28:28.292 --> 28:30.335
The car!

28:45.809 --> 28:47.644
Dad's gonna kill me.

28:56.195 --> 28:58.530
See you, Hedwig.

28:59.865 --> 29:02.201
So a house-elf shows
up in my bedroom...

29:02.367 --> 29:05.329
...we can't get through the
barrier to platform 93/4...

29:05.496 --> 29:08.749
...we almost get
killed by a tree...

29:08.916 --> 29:12.461
Clearly someone doesn't
want me here this year.

29:16.048 --> 29:19.009
Well, take a good look, lads.

29:19.176 --> 29:23.096
This night might well be the
last you spend in this castle.

29:25.891 --> 29:29.394
Oh, dear, we are in trouble.

29:29.686 --> 29:35.059
You were seen by no less
than seven Muggles.

29:36.318 --> 29:39.071
Do you have any idea
how serious this is?

29:39.780 --> 29:43.617
You have risked the
exposure of our world.

29:44.284 --> 29:47.204
Not to mention the damage you
inflicted on a Whomping Willow...

29:47.371 --> 29:50.541
...that's been on these grounds
since before you were born.

29:50.999 --> 29:54.545
Honestly, Professor Snape, I
think it did more damage to us.

29:54.711 --> 29:55.879
Silence.

29:57.881 --> 30:03.263
I assure you that were you in Slytherin,
and your fate rested with me...

30:04.429 --> 30:08.225
...the both of you would be
on the train home tonight.

30:09.393 --> 30:11.645
- As it is...
- They are not.

30:13.856 --> 30:17.901
Professor Dumbledore.
Professor McGonagall.

30:18.277 --> 30:19.778
Headmaster...

30:19.945 --> 30:24.741
...these boys have flouted the Decree for
the Restriction of Underage Wizardry.

30:24.908 --> 30:28.829
- As such... - I am well
aware of our bylaws...

30:28.996 --> 30:31.874
...having written quite
a few of them myself.

30:32.249 --> 30:35.460
However, as head of
Gryffindor house...

30:35.627 --> 30:40.632
...it is for Professor McGonagall to
determine the appropriate action.

30:41.091 --> 30:43.260
We'll go and get
our stuff, then.

30:43.427 --> 30:45.888
What are you talking
about, Mr. Weasley?

30:46.054 --> 30:48.265
You're going to expel
us, aren't you?

30:49.808 --> 30:52.936
Not today, Mr. Weasley...

30:53.103 --> 30:58.108
...but I must impress on both of you
the seriousness of what you have done.

30:58.650 --> 31:03.280
I will be writing to your families tonight,
and you will both receive detention.

31:27.638 --> 31:30.140
Morning, everyone.

31:30.807 --> 31:33.352
- Good morning, everyone. -
Good morning, Professor Sprout.

31:33.519 --> 31:37.814
Welcome to Greenhouse Three, second
years. Gather around, everyone.

31:37.981 --> 31:40.817
Today we're going to
re-pot Mandrakes.

31:40.984 --> 31:44.988
Who here can tell me the
properties of the Mandrake root?

31:45.155 --> 31:46.990
Yes, Miss Granger?

31:47.157 --> 31:49.493
Mandrake, or Mandragora...

31:49.660 --> 31:54.665
...is used to return those who have
been Petrified to their original state.

31:54.832 --> 31:59.837
It's also dangerous. The Mandrake's
cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.

32:00.003 --> 32:02.840
Excellent. Ten points
to Gryffindor.

32:03.006 --> 32:05.676
As our Mandrakes are
still only seedlings...

32:05.843 --> 32:07.761
...their cries won't
kill you yet.

32:07.928 --> 32:11.723
But they could knock you out for hours,
which is why I have given you earmuffs...

32:11.890 --> 32:13.392
...for auditory protection.

32:13.559 --> 32:18.021
So could you please put them
on, right away? Quickly.

32:18.188 --> 32:20.983
Flaps tight down, and
watch me closely.

32:21.149 --> 32:24.152
You grasp your Mandrake firmly.

32:24.319 --> 32:27.322
You pull it sharply
up out of the pot.

32:31.577 --> 32:33.495
Got it? And...

32:33.704 --> 32:35.831
...now you dunk it down
into the other pot...

32:35.998 --> 32:40.711
...and pour a little sprinkling
of soil to keep him warm.

32:44.339 --> 32:47.551
Longbottom's been
neglecting his earmuffs.

32:47.968 --> 32:52.014
- No, ma'am, he's just fainted. -
Yes, well, just leave him there.

32:52.389 --> 32:55.934
Right, on we go. Plenty
of pots to go around.

32:56.101 --> 32:59.688
Grasp your Mandrake
and pull it up.

33:14.620 --> 33:18.415
- There's Nearly Headless Nick.
- Hello, Percy, Miss Clearwater.

33:18.582 --> 33:21.126
Hello, Sir Nicholas.

33:32.596 --> 33:35.891
Say it. I'm doomed.

33:36.725 --> 33:38.644
- You're doomed.
- Hi, Harry.

33:40.896 --> 33:43.607
I'm Colin Creevey. I'm
in Gryffindor too.

33:43.774 --> 33:45.400
Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you.

33:45.943 --> 33:47.778
Ron, is that your owl?

34:02.501 --> 34:05.170
Bloody bird's a menace.

34:09.382 --> 34:10.884
Oh, no.

34:11.051 --> 34:14.513
Look, everyone. Weasley's
got himself a Howler.

34:15.973 --> 34:21.228
Go on, Ron. I ignored one from
my gran once. It was horrible.

34:28.402 --> 34:30.279
<i>Ronald Weasley!</i>

34:32.906 --> 34:38.096
<i>How dare you steal that car!
I am absolutely disgusted!</i>

34:39.288 --> 34:41.873
<i>Your father's now facing
an inquiry at work...</i>

34:42.040 --> 34:44.418
<i>...nd it's entirely
your fault!</i>

34:44.877 --> 34:48.755
<i>If you put another
toe out of line...</i>

34:48.922 --> 34:52.176
<i>...we'll bring you
straight home!</i>

34:52.967 --> 34:56.471
<i>And, Ginny, dear, congratulations
on making Gryffindor.</i>

34:56.638 --> 35:00.350
<i>Your father and
I are so proud.</i>

35:18.619 --> 35:24.042
Let me introduce you to your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

35:25.209 --> 35:26.752
Me.

35:26.919 --> 35:29.463
Gilderoy Lockhart...

35:29.630 --> 35:32.925
...Order of Merlin,
Third Class...

35:33.091 --> 35:36.428
...honorary member of the
Dark Force Defense League...

35:36.595 --> 35:39.515
...and five times winner...

35:39.848 --> 35:45.729
<i>...of Witch Weekly's
Most-Charming-Smile Award.</i>

35:46.104 --> 35:47.606
But I don't talk about that.

35:47.773 --> 35:52.319
I didn't get rid of the Bandon
Banshee by smiling at him.

35:56.073 --> 35:58.909
Now, be warned.

35:59.201 --> 36:01.245
It is my job to arm you...

36:01.411 --> 36:06.750
...against the foulest
creatures known to wizardkind.

36:07.584 --> 36:11.171
You may find yourselves facing
your worst fears in this room.

36:11.338 --> 36:15.384
Know only that no harm can
befall you whilst I am here.

36:15.551 --> 36:18.470
I must ask you not to scream.

36:18.637 --> 36:21.223
It might provoke them.

36:24.685 --> 36:26.228
Cornish pixies?

36:26.395 --> 36:29.439
Freshly caught Cornish pixies.

36:30.232 --> 36:32.359
Laugh if you will,
Mr. Finnegan...

36:32.526 --> 36:36.697
...but pixies can be devilishly
tricky little blighters.

36:36.864 --> 36:39.783
Let's see what you make of them.

36:44.121 --> 36:47.374
Come on now, round them up.
They're only pixies.

37:03.140 --> 37:07.269
- You just stay there!
- Please, get me down!

37:09.605 --> 37:12.065
- Get off me!
- Stop. Hold still!

37:13.692 --> 37:16.904
<i>Peskipiksi Pesternomi!</i>

37:36.882 --> 37:41.178
I'll ask you three to just nip the
rest of them back into their cage.

37:42.930 --> 37:45.098
What do we do now?

37:46.558 --> 37:48.060
<i>Immobulus!</i>

37:57.569 --> 37:59.822
Why is it always me?

38:06.161 --> 38:08.872
I spent the summer devising a
whole new Quidditch program.

38:09.039 --> 38:12.709
We're gonna train earlier,
harder and longer.

38:12.876 --> 38:16.171
What...? I don't believe it.

38:18.966 --> 38:21.677
- Where you think you're going,
Flint? - Quidditch practice.

38:21.844 --> 38:26.223
- I booked the pitch for Gryffindor
today. - Easy, Wood. I've got a note.

38:27.641 --> 38:29.852
I smell trouble.

38:30.435 --> 38:33.981
"I, Professor Severus Snape, do
hereby give the Slytherin team...

38:34.147 --> 38:37.651
...permission to practice today, owing
to the need to train their new Seeker."

38:37.818 --> 38:40.487
You've got a new Seeker. Who?

38:44.449 --> 38:47.077
- Malfoy?
- That's right.

38:47.244 --> 38:50.038
And that's not all
that's new this year.

38:50.873 --> 38:54.293
Those are Nimbus 2001 s.
How did you get those?

38:54.459 --> 38:56.545
A gift from Draco's father.

38:56.712 --> 39:00.465
You see, Weasley, unlike some,
my father can afford the best.

39:00.632 --> 39:03.635
At least no one on the Gryffindor
team had to buy their way in.

39:03.802 --> 39:06.722
They got in on pure talent.

39:09.933 --> 39:13.812
No one asked your opinion,
you filthy little Mudblood.

39:16.315 --> 39:19.776
You'll pay for that one, Malfoy.
Eat slugs!

39:27.326 --> 39:29.203
You okay, Ron?

39:32.206 --> 39:33.999
Say something.

39:40.255 --> 39:44.760
- Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?
- No, Colin, get out of the way.

39:45.677 --> 39:47.721
Let's take him to Hagrid's.

39:47.888 --> 39:50.015
He'll know what to do.

39:58.899 --> 40:02.277
This calls for a
specialist's equipment.

40:06.031 --> 40:09.618
Nothing to do but wait
till it stops, I'm afraid.

40:10.285 --> 40:13.455
- Okay.
- Better out than in.

40:14.039 --> 40:19.378
- Who was Ron trying to curse, anyway?
- Malfoy. He called Hermione...

40:20.587 --> 40:24.007
Well, I don't know
exactly what it means.

40:27.970 --> 40:30.180
He called me a Mudblood.

40:30.347 --> 40:33.016
- He did not.
- What's a Mudblood?

40:33.392 --> 40:37.938
It means "dirty blood. " Mudblood's a
foul name for someone who's Muggle-born.

40:38.105 --> 40:42.359
Someone with non-magic parents.
Someone like me.

40:42.860 --> 40:46.989
It's not a term one usually hears
in civilized conversation.

40:48.157 --> 40:52.953
See, the thing is, Harry, there are
some wizards, like the Malfoy family...

40:53.120 --> 40:57.791
...who think they're better than everyone
else because they're pure-blood.

40:57.958 --> 40:59.585
That's horrible.

41:02.588 --> 41:03.922
It's disgusting.

41:04.089 --> 41:07.593
And it's codswallop to boot.
Dirty blood.

41:07.759 --> 41:11.138
Why, there isn't a wizard alive today
that's not half-blood or less.

41:11.305 --> 41:15.851
More to the point, they've yet to think
of a spell that our Hermione can't do.

41:16.018 --> 41:18.228
Come here.

41:19.354 --> 41:25.019
Don't you think on it, Hermione. Don't
you think on it for one minute.

41:33.577 --> 41:36.622
Harry, Harry, Harry.

41:36.788 --> 41:39.041
Can you possibly imagine...

41:39.208 --> 41:42.419
...a better way to
serve detention...

41:43.045 --> 41:45.756
...than by helping me
to answer my fan mail?

41:45.923 --> 41:47.341
Not really.

41:47.508 --> 41:53.089
Fame is a fickle friend, Harry.
Celebrity is as celebrity does.

41:54.056 --> 41:55.974
Remember that.

41:59.728 --> 42:01.897
<i>Come.</i>

42:02.064 --> 42:04.191
<i>Come...</i>

42:05.442 --> 42:08.320
<i>...to me.</i>

42:11.615 --> 42:14.159
- What?
- Sorry?

42:16.411 --> 42:18.372
That voice.

42:18.539 --> 42:20.082
Voice?

42:23.627 --> 42:28.257
- Didn't you hear it? - What
are you talking about, Harry?

42:28.882 --> 42:32.469
I think you're getting
a bit drowsy.

42:32.636 --> 42:36.723
And great Scott, no wonder. Look at the
time. We've been here nearly four hours.

42:37.015 --> 42:40.394
Spooky how the time flies
when one is having fun.

42:45.357 --> 42:47.901
Spooky.

42:50.946 --> 42:53.073
<i>Blood.</i>

42:53.240 --> 42:56.785
<i>I smell blood.</i>

42:56.952 --> 43:00.038
<i>Let me rip you.</i>

43:00.205 --> 43:03.792
<i>Let me kill you.</i>

43:05.627 --> 43:07.087
<i>Kill!</i>

43:08.005 --> 43:09.339
<i>Kill!</i>

43:10.048 --> 43:11.967
<i>- Kill!
- Harry!</i>

43:12.134 --> 43:14.636
- Did you hear it?
- Hear what?

43:14.803 --> 43:18.223
- That voice.
- Voice? What voice?

43:18.390 --> 43:22.352
I heard it first in Lockhart's
office. And then again just...

43:22.644 --> 43:24.730
<i>It's time.</i>

43:24.897 --> 43:28.108
It's moving. I think
it's going to kill.

43:29.067 --> 43:33.030
- Kill?
- Harry, wait! Not so fast!

43:58.597 --> 44:00.682
Strange.

44:01.183 --> 44:05.687
- I've never seen spiders act like
that. - I don't like spiders.

44:09.817 --> 44:11.860
What's that?

44:15.322 --> 44:19.868
"The Chamber of Secrets has been
opened. Enemies of the Heir, beware."

44:20.035 --> 44:22.287
It's written in blood.

44:25.207 --> 44:27.376
Oh, no.

44:32.089 --> 44:34.383
It's Filch's cat.

44:34.883 --> 44:37.177
It's Mrs. Norris.

44:53.235 --> 44:55.946
"Enemies of the Heir, beware."

44:57.447 --> 44:59.825
You'll be next, Mudbloods.

44:59.992 --> 45:05.164
What's going on here? Go on.
Make way, make way.

45:06.623 --> 45:08.458
Potter?

45:08.625 --> 45:10.752
What are you...?

45:14.089 --> 45:16.383
Mrs. Norris?

45:17.885 --> 45:22.055
- You've murdered my cat.
- No. No.

45:22.431 --> 45:23.724
I'll kill you.

45:26.059 --> 45:28.896
- I'll kill you!
- Argus!

45:30.272 --> 45:32.441
Argus, I...

45:34.443 --> 45:39.072
Everyone will proceed to their
dormitories immediately.

45:39.781 --> 45:41.783
Everyone except...

45:42.576 --> 45:44.786
...you three.

45:46.914 --> 45:49.666
Ravenclaws, follow me.

45:51.543 --> 45:55.422
She's not dead, Argus.
She has been Petrified.

45:55.589 --> 45:58.425
Thought so. So unlucky
I wasn't there.

45:58.592 --> 46:01.803
I know exactly the countercurse
that could've spared her.

46:04.139 --> 46:06.767
But how she has been
Petrified, I cannot say.

46:07.017 --> 46:09.728
Ask him. It's him
that's done it.

46:09.895 --> 46:12.606
You saw what he
wrote on the wall.

46:12.773 --> 46:16.860
It's not true, sir. I swear.
I never touched Mrs. Norris.

46:17.027 --> 46:21.490
- Rubbish.
- If I might, headmaster?

46:21.949 --> 46:26.745
Perhaps Potter and his friends were just
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

46:27.246 --> 46:29.164
However...

46:29.498 --> 46:32.459
...the circumstances
are suspicious.

46:32.626 --> 46:37.256
I, for one, don't recall
seeing Potter at dinner.

46:37.422 --> 46:39.675
I'm afraid that's
my doing, Severus.

46:39.842 --> 46:43.262
You see, Harry was helping
me answer my fan mail.

46:43.428 --> 46:46.723
That's why Ron and I went
looking for him, Professor.

46:46.890 --> 46:49.643
We'd just found him
when he said...

46:51.895 --> 46:55.732
- Yes, Miss Granger?
- When I said I wasn't hungry.

46:57.109 --> 47:01.113
We were heading back to the common
room when we found Mrs. Norris.

47:03.448 --> 47:08.996
- Innocent until proven guilty,
Severus. - My cat has been Petrified.

47:09.830 --> 47:15.669
- I want to see some punishment! -
We will be able to cure her, Argus.

47:16.587 --> 47:21.383
As I understand it, Madam Sprout has
a very healthy growth of Mandrake.

47:21.550 --> 47:25.971
When matured, a potion will be made
which will revive Mrs. Norris.

47:26.305 --> 47:28.015
And in the meantime...

47:28.557 --> 47:32.561
...I strongly
recommend caution...

47:33.228 --> 47:35.230
...to all.

47:46.241 --> 47:49.703
- It's a bit strange, isn't it?
- Strange?

47:49.870 --> 47:52.623
You hear this voice, a
voice only you can hear...

47:52.789 --> 47:57.503
...and then Mrs. Norris turns up
Petrified. It's just strange.

47:57.669 --> 48:00.923
Do you think I should have told them?
Dumbledore and the others, I mean?

48:01.089 --> 48:02.549
Are you mad?

48:02.716 --> 48:08.222
No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world,
hearing voices isn't a good sign.

48:10.307 --> 48:12.684
She's right, you know.

48:17.022 --> 48:19.358
Could I have your
attention, please?

48:19.900 --> 48:25.405
Right. Now, today, we will
be transforming animals...

48:25.572 --> 48:27.950
...into water goblets.

48:28.867 --> 48:30.536
Like so.

48:30.702 --> 48:35.624
<i>One, two, three. Vera Verto.</i>

48:39.169 --> 48:43.090
Now it's your turn. Who
would like to go first?

48:43.674 --> 48:48.637
<i>Mr. Weasley. "One, two, three.
Vera Verto. ".</i>

48:52.224 --> 48:54.309
<i>Vera Verto!</i>

49:00.440 --> 49:03.110
That wand needs
replacing, Mr. Weasley.

49:04.444 --> 49:06.613
- Yes, Miss Granger?
- Professor...

49:06.780 --> 49:10.993
...I was wondering if you could tell
us about the Chamber of Secrets.

49:17.166 --> 49:18.417
Very well.

49:19.918 --> 49:21.920
You all know, of course...

49:22.087 --> 49:25.966
...that Hogwarts was founded
over a thousand years ago...

49:26.133 --> 49:30.554
...by the four greatest witches
and wizards of the age

49:30.721 --> 49:34.474
Godric Gryffindor,
Helga Hufflepuff...

49:34.641 --> 49:40.272
...Rowena Ravenclaw and
Salazar Slytherin.

49:40.939 --> 49:46.245
Now, three of the founders
coexisted quite harmoniously.

49:47.112 --> 49:50.157
- One did not.
- Three guesses who.

49:50.866 --> 49:53.327
Salazar Slytherin wished
to be more selective...

49:53.494 --> 49:56.663
...about the students
admitted to Hogwarts.

49:56.830 --> 50:01.418
He believed magical learning should
be kept within all-magic families.

50:01.585 --> 50:03.712
In other words, pure-bloods.

50:04.087 --> 50:09.426
Unable to sway the others, he
decided to leave the school.

50:10.260 --> 50:12.513
Now, according to legend...

50:12.679 --> 50:16.391
...Slytherin had built a hidden
chamber in this castle...

50:16.558 --> 50:20.229
...known as the
Chamber of Secrets.

50:20.395 --> 50:24.817
Though, shortly before
departing, he sealed it...

50:24.983 --> 50:29.112
...until that time when his own
true Heir returned to the school.

50:29.279 --> 50:31.657
The Heir alone...

50:31.824 --> 50:34.493
...would be able to
open the Chamber...

50:34.660 --> 50:39.414
...and unleash the horror
within, and by so doing...

50:39.581 --> 50:42.960
...purge the school
of all those who...

50:43.126 --> 50:48.131
...in Slytherin's view, were
unworthy to study magic.

50:48.757 --> 50:50.884
Muggle-borns.

50:51.927 --> 50:55.556
Naturally, the school has
been searched many times.

50:55.722 --> 50:59.184
No such chamber has been found.

50:59.768 --> 51:04.439
Professor? What exactly does legend
tell us lies within the Chamber?

51:05.274 --> 51:07.860
The Chamber is said to
be home to something...

51:08.026 --> 51:11.613
...that only the Heir of
Slytherin can control.

51:12.239 --> 51:15.868
It is said to be the home...

51:16.034 --> 51:17.661
...of a monster.

51:23.417 --> 51:27.087
Do you think it's true? Do you think
there really is a Chamber of Secrets?

51:27.254 --> 51:31.466
Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's
worried. All the teachers are.

51:31.633 --> 51:35.470
If there really is a Chamber of Secrets,
and it has been opened, that means...

51:35.637 --> 51:39.600
The Heir of Slytherin has returned to
Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?

51:39.766 --> 51:44.146
Let's think. Who do we know who
thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?

51:44.313 --> 51:46.982
- If you're talking about Malfoy...
- Of course. You heard him.

51:47.149 --> 51:48.859
"You'll be next, Mudbloods."

51:49.026 --> 51:51.653
I heard him. But Malfoy,
the Heir of Slytherin?

51:51.820 --> 51:54.990
Maybe Ron's right, Hermione.
I mean, look at his family.

51:55.157 --> 51:57.951
The whole lot of them have been
in Slytherin for centuries.

51:58.118 --> 52:01.538
Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe
we could trick them into telling.

52:01.997 --> 52:06.168
Even they aren't that thick. But
there might be another way.

52:06.335 --> 52:08.170
Mind you, it would be difficult.

52:08.337 --> 52:11.381
Not to mention we'd be breaking
about 50 school rules...

52:11.548 --> 52:16.011
...and it'll be dangerous.
Very dangerous.

52:22.851 --> 52:25.312
Here it is. The
Polyjuice Potion.

52:25.479 --> 52:28.190
"Properly brewed, the Polyjuice
Potion allows the drinker...

52:28.357 --> 52:32.611
...to transform himself temporarily
into the physical form of another."

52:32.778 --> 52:36.573
You mean if Harry and I drink that
stuff, we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?

52:36.740 --> 52:40.118
- Wicked! Malfoy will tell
us anything. - Exactly.

52:40.285 --> 52:44.164
But it's tricky. I've never
seen a more complicated potion.

52:44.331 --> 52:47.417
- How long will it take
to make? - A month.

52:47.793 --> 52:49.253
A month?

52:49.419 --> 52:53.257
But, Hermione, if Malfoy is
the Heir of Slytherin...

52:53.423 --> 52:56.635
...he could attack half the
Muggle-borns in the school by then.

52:56.802 --> 52:58.720
I know.

52:58.887 --> 53:01.723
But it's the only
plan we've got.

53:51.398 --> 53:54.109
Another goal for Slytherin!

53:55.527 --> 53:58.822
They lead Gryffindor 90 to 30.

53:59.990 --> 54:01.575
Yeah!

54:01.825 --> 54:03.619
Yeah!

54:27.851 --> 54:30.187
All right there, Scarhead?

54:36.318 --> 54:38.821
Watch yourself, Harry!

54:39.196 --> 54:40.989
Wood, look out!

54:54.670 --> 54:57.506
Blimey! Harry's got
himself a rogue Bludger.

54:57.673 --> 54:59.424
That's been tampered
with, that has.

55:00.467 --> 55:01.510
I'll stop it.

55:01.677 --> 55:06.265
No! Even with a proper wand, it's
too risky. You could hit Harry.

55:31.331 --> 55:33.917
Training for the ballet, Potter?

56:04.907 --> 56:07.117
You'll never catch me, Potter.

57:37.916 --> 57:39.001
Let's go.

57:39.168 --> 57:44.381
<i>Harry Potter has caught the
Snitch. Gryffindor wins!</i>

57:50.679 --> 57:52.723
<i>Finite Incantatem!</i>

57:59.813 --> 58:01.148
- Thank you.
- Are you okay?

58:01.315 --> 58:03.400
No. I think my arm is broken.

58:03.567 --> 58:07.362
Not to worry, Harry. I will fix
that arm of yours straightaway.

58:07.529 --> 58:10.491
- Not you. - Boy doesn't
know what he's saying.

58:10.657 --> 58:14.203
This won't hurt a bit.

58:20.292 --> 58:23.295
<i>Brackium Emendo!</i>

58:31.345 --> 58:34.431
Yes, well, that can
sometimes happen...

58:34.598 --> 58:36.850
...but the point is...

58:38.227 --> 58:42.356
...you can no longer feel any pain, and,
very clearly, the bones are not broken.

58:42.523 --> 58:45.192
Broken? There's no bones left.

58:46.902 --> 58:48.862
Much more flexible, though.

58:51.323 --> 58:55.244
Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a
fuss. You can go. Out of my way.

58:55.410 --> 58:57.371
Should have been brought
straight to me.

58:57.538 --> 59:00.082
I can mend bones in a heartbeat,
but growing them back...

59:00.249 --> 59:01.750
You will be able to, won't you?

59:01.917 --> 59:05.045
I'll be able to, certainly.
But it'll be painful.

59:05.671 --> 59:10.342
You're in for a rough night, Potter.
Regrowing bones is a nasty business.

59:13.262 --> 59:16.265
What do you expect?
Pumpkin juice?

59:22.896 --> 59:24.648
<i>Kill.</i>

59:25.482 --> 59:27.025
<i>Kill.</i>

59:32.406 --> 59:35.617
<i>Time to kill.</i>

59:41.748 --> 59:42.791
Hello.

59:44.585 --> 59:45.627
Dobby?

59:45.794 --> 59:48.130
Harry Potter should
have listened to Dobby.

59:48.589 --> 59:52.301
Harry Potter should have gone back
home when he missed the train.

59:52.467 --> 59:57.097
It was you. You stopped the barrier
from letting Ron and me through.

59:57.389 --> 01:00:00.350
Indeed. Yes, sir.

01:00:01.351 --> 01:00:06.398
- You nearly got Ron and me expelled. -
At least you would be away from here.

01:00:06.565 --> 01:00:09.234
Harry Potter must go home.

01:00:09.401 --> 01:00:12.988
Dobby thought his Bludger would be
enough to make Harry Potter see...

01:00:13.155 --> 01:00:16.533
Your Bludger? You made that
Bludger chase after me?

01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:20.287
Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir.

01:00:20.454 --> 01:00:24.082
Dobby had to iron his hands.

01:00:26.293 --> 01:00:30.881
You better clear off before my bones
come back, or I might strangle you.

01:00:33.509 --> 01:00:35.511
Dobby is used to
death threats, sir.

01:00:35.677 --> 01:00:38.722
Dobby gets them five
times a day at home.

01:00:38.889 --> 01:00:41.683
I don't suppose you could tell
me why you're trying to kill me?

01:00:41.975 --> 01:00:45.854
Not kill you, sir.
Never kill you.

01:00:46.021 --> 01:00:49.358
Dobby remembers how it was
before Harry Potter triumphed...

01:00:49.525 --> 01:00:52.653
...over
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.

01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:56.532
We house-elves were
treated like vermin, sir.

01:00:56.698 --> 01:01:02.120
Of course, Dobby is still
treated like vermin.

01:01:11.463 --> 01:01:14.091
Why do you wear
that thing, Dobby?

01:01:14.258 --> 01:01:19.388
This, sir? It is a mark of
the house-elf's enslavement.

01:01:19.555 --> 01:01:24.685
Dobby can only be freed if his
master presents him with clothes.

01:01:26.812 --> 01:01:28.188
Listen.

01:01:28.355 --> 01:01:29.898
Listen!

01:01:30.065 --> 01:01:33.777
Terrible things are about
to happen at Hogwarts.

01:01:34.403 --> 01:01:36.864
Harry Potter must
not stay here...

01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:41.577
...now that history
is to repeat itself.

01:01:41.743 --> 01:01:45.205
Repeat itself? You mean
this has happened before?

01:01:45.372 --> 01:01:47.374
I shouldn't have said that.

01:01:51.086 --> 01:01:54.256
- Bad Dobby! Bad!
- Stop it!

01:01:54.423 --> 01:01:56.091
Stop it, Dobby!

01:01:57.759 --> 01:02:01.597
Tell me. When did this happen
before? Who's doing it now?

01:02:01.763 --> 01:02:06.977
Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby only
wants Harry Potter to be safe.

01:02:07.144 --> 01:02:10.063
No, Dobby. Tell me. Who is it?

01:02:21.909 --> 01:02:22.993
Put him here.

01:02:27.581 --> 01:02:30.501
- What happened?
- There's been another attack.

01:02:30.667 --> 01:02:36.465
I think he's been
Petrified, Madam Pomfrey.

01:02:37.257 --> 01:02:41.970
Look. Perhaps he managed to
take a picture of his attacker.

01:02:50.062 --> 01:02:52.815
What can this mean, Albus?

01:02:52.981 --> 01:02:54.942
It means...

01:02:55.317 --> 01:02:58.070
...that our students
are in great danger.

01:02:58.237 --> 01:03:01.657
- What should I tell the staff?
- The truth.

01:03:01.907 --> 01:03:05.702
Tell them Hogwarts
is no longer safe.

01:03:06.036 --> 01:03:08.997
It is as we feared, Minerva.

01:03:09.248 --> 01:03:13.794
The Chamber of Secrets has
indeed been opened again.

01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:20.759
Again? You mean the Chamber of
Secrets has been opened before?

01:03:20.926 --> 01:03:23.679
Of course. Don't you see?

01:03:23.846 --> 01:03:26.849
Lucius Malfoy must have opened
it when he was at school here.

01:03:27.474 --> 01:03:30.060
- Now he's taught Draco
how to do it. - Maybe.

01:03:30.227 --> 01:03:33.397
We'll have to wait for the
Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.

01:03:33.564 --> 01:03:37.526
Enlighten me. Why are we brewing
this potion in broad daylight...

01:03:37.693 --> 01:03:41.655
...in the middle of the girls' lavatory?
Don't you think we'll get caught?

01:03:42.531 --> 01:03:45.200
No. No one ever comes in here.

01:03:46.034 --> 01:03:48.579
- Why?
- Moaning Myrtle.

01:03:48.745 --> 01:03:50.706
Who?

01:03:51.206 --> 01:03:52.875
Moaning Myrtle.

01:03:53.167 --> 01:03:56.503
- Who's Moaning Myrtle?
- I'm Moaning Myrtle.

01:04:02.426 --> 01:04:04.803
I wouldn't expect
you to know me.

01:04:04.970 --> 01:04:08.015
Who would ever talk about
ugly, miserable...

01:04:08.182 --> 01:04:11.560
...moping Moaning Myrtle?

01:04:18.775 --> 01:04:20.903
She's a little sensitive.

01:04:25.407 --> 01:04:27.367
Gather round!

01:04:27.701 --> 01:04:32.706
Gather round. Can
everybody see me?

01:04:32.873 --> 01:04:36.001
Can you all hear me?

01:04:36.668 --> 01:04:38.003
Excellent.

01:04:38.504 --> 01:04:42.216
In light of the dark
events of recent weeks...

01:04:42.382 --> 01:04:47.054
...Professor Dumbledore has granted me
permission to start this Dueling Club...

01:04:47.221 --> 01:04:51.892
...to train you all up in case you
ever need to defend yourselves...

01:04:52.142 --> 01:04:54.686
...as I myself have done
on countless occasions.

01:04:54.895 --> 01:04:58.565
For full details, see
my published works.

01:05:03.278 --> 01:05:06.406
Let me introduce my assistant...

01:05:06.573 --> 01:05:09.201
...Professor Snape.

01:05:12.538 --> 01:05:15.332
He has sportingly agreed to help
with a short demonstration.

01:05:15.499 --> 01:05:17.543
I don't want any of you
youngsters to worry.

01:05:17.709 --> 01:05:22.631
You'll still have your Potions master
when I'm through with him. Never fear.

01:05:38.272 --> 01:05:39.898
One.

01:05:40.065 --> 01:05:41.108
Two.

01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:44.945
<i>- Three!
- Expelliarmus!</i>

01:05:53.537 --> 01:05:56.206
- Do you think he's all right?
- Who cares?

01:05:56.373 --> 01:05:59.334
An excellent idea to show
them that, Professor Snape...

01:05:59.501 --> 01:06:04.047
...but if you don't mind me saying, it
was obvious what you were about to do.

01:06:04.214 --> 01:06:07.467
If I had wanted to stop you, it
would have been only too easy.

01:06:07.634 --> 01:06:11.096
Perhaps it would be prudent to
first teach the students...

01:06:11.263 --> 01:06:15.767
...to block unfriendly
spells, Professor.

01:06:17.519 --> 01:06:19.938
An excellent suggestion,
Professor Snape.

01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:25.444
Let's have a volunteer pair.
Potter, Weasley, how about you?

01:06:25.611 --> 01:06:29.114
Weasley's wand causes devastation
with the simplest spells.

01:06:29.531 --> 01:06:33.243
We'll be sending Potter to the
hospital wing in a matchbox.

01:06:33.410 --> 01:06:37.498
Might I suggest someone
from my own house?

01:06:38.749 --> 01:06:41.251
Malfoy, perhaps?

01:06:48.759 --> 01:06:51.261
- Good luck, Potter.
- Thank you, sir.

01:06:59.228 --> 01:07:01.230
Wands at the ready.

01:07:01.814 --> 01:07:04.817
- Scared, Potter?
- You wish.

01:07:15.244 --> 01:07:16.954
On the count of three...

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:21.458
...cast your charms to disarm
your opponent. Only to disarm.

01:07:21.625 --> 01:07:25.170
We don't want any
accidents here. One.

01:07:26.964 --> 01:07:29.508
<i>- Two.
- Everte Statum!</i>

01:07:41.145 --> 01:07:43.397
<i>Rictusempra!</i>

01:07:54.366 --> 01:07:56.160
I said disarm only.

01:07:56.326 --> 01:07:58.328
<i>Serpensortia!</i>

01:08:07.004 --> 01:08:09.798
Don't move, Potter. I'll
get rid of it for you.

01:08:09.965 --> 01:08:15.387
<i>Allow me, Professor Snape.
Alarte Ascendare!</i>

01:08:57.930 --> 01:09:00.599
<i>Vipera Evanesca.</i>

01:09:07.314 --> 01:09:09.691
What are you playing at?

01:09:22.453 --> 01:09:25.165
You're a Parselmouth?
Why didn't you tell us?

01:09:25.332 --> 01:09:27.584
- I'm a what?
- You can talk to snakes.

01:09:27.751 --> 01:09:33.090
I know. I accidentally set a python
on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once.

01:09:33.256 --> 01:09:37.219
Once. But so what? I bet loads
of people here can do it.

01:09:37.386 --> 01:09:41.140
No, they can't. It's not a
very common gift, Harry.

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:43.350
This is bad.

01:09:43.517 --> 01:09:47.270
What's bad? If I hadn't told that
snake not to attack Justin...

01:09:47.437 --> 01:09:50.899
- That's what you said to it.
- You were there. You heard me.

01:09:51.066 --> 01:09:54.945
I heard you speaking
Parseltongue. Snake language.

01:09:55.112 --> 01:09:57.990
I spoke a different language?

01:09:59.074 --> 01:10:01.451
But I didn't realize...

01:10:01.618 --> 01:10:04.413
How can I speak a language
without knowing I can?

01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:08.584
I don't know, but it sounded like you
were egging the snake on or something.

01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:10.460
Harry, listen to me.

01:10:10.878 --> 01:10:13.755
There's a reason the symbol of
Slytherin house is a serpent.

01:10:13.922 --> 01:10:18.427
Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth.
He could talk to snakes too.

01:10:18.677 --> 01:10:19.720
Exactly.

01:10:19.887 --> 01:10:23.265
Now the whole school's gonna think
you're his great-great-great grandson.

01:10:23.432 --> 01:10:25.434
But I'm not.

01:10:28.145 --> 01:10:30.105
I can't be.

01:10:31.231 --> 01:10:33.275
He lived a thousand years ago.

01:10:33.442 --> 01:10:36.653
For all we know, you could be.

01:11:06.767 --> 01:11:09.144
I'll see you back
in the common room.

01:11:25.536 --> 01:11:29.832
<i>I want blood.</i>

01:11:32.709 --> 01:11:37.714
<i>They all must die.</i>

01:11:38.298 --> 01:11:40.300
<i>Kill.</i>

01:11:40.968 --> 01:11:43.053
<i>Kill.</i>

01:11:43.846 --> 01:11:46.140
<i>Kill.</i>

01:11:46.473 --> 01:11:50.519
<i>Time to kill.</i>

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:26.638
Caught in the act.

01:12:26.805 --> 01:12:28.765
I'll have you out
this time, Potter.

01:12:29.266 --> 01:12:31.768
Mark my words.

01:12:31.935 --> 01:12:36.190
No. Mr. Filch! You
don't understand...

01:13:02.925 --> 01:13:04.885
Professor...

01:13:05.052 --> 01:13:06.428
...I swear I didn't.

01:13:06.637 --> 01:13:09.848
This is out of my hands, Potter.

01:13:19.483 --> 01:13:22.152
Professor Dumbledore
will be waiting for you.

01:13:31.078 --> 01:13:33.664
Sherbet Lemon.

01:14:07.614 --> 01:14:09.741
Professor Dumbledore?

01:14:26.216 --> 01:14:28.927
Bee in your bonnet, Potter?

01:14:31.805 --> 01:14:36.351
I was just wondering if you
put me in the right house.

01:14:36.518 --> 01:14:41.982
Yes. You were particularly
difficult to place.

01:14:42.149 --> 01:14:45.694
But I stand by what
I said last year.

01:14:45.861 --> 01:14:49.239
You would have done
well in Slytherin.

01:14:49.406 --> 01:14:50.741
You're wrong.

01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:21.438
Harry?

01:15:21.814 --> 01:15:24.066
Professor.

01:15:24.233 --> 01:15:28.028
Your bird... There was
nothing I could do.

01:15:28.612 --> 01:15:31.949
- He just caught fire.
- And about time too.

01:15:32.783 --> 01:15:35.118
He's been looking
dreadful for days.

01:15:35.285 --> 01:15:37.287
Pity you had to see
him on a burning day.

01:15:39.206 --> 01:15:42.459
Fawkes is a Phoenix, Harry.

01:15:42.626 --> 01:15:45.963
They burst into flame when it
is time for them to die...

01:15:46.129 --> 01:15:48.257
...and then they are...

01:15:48.423 --> 01:15:51.468
...reborn from the ashes.

01:15:59.852 --> 01:16:02.479
Fascinating
creatures, phoenixes.

01:16:02.938 --> 01:16:06.817
They can carry
immensely heavy loads.

01:16:06.984 --> 01:16:09.820
Their tears have healing powers.

01:16:12.447 --> 01:16:15.492
Professor Dumbledore, sir!
Wait! Listen!

01:16:16.493 --> 01:16:18.620
Professor Dumbledore,
sir, it wasn't Harry.

01:16:19.788 --> 01:16:22.666
I'd be prepared to swear it in
front of the Ministry of Magic.

01:16:24.126 --> 01:16:26.003
Relax.

01:16:26.753 --> 01:16:28.714
I do not believe...

01:16:28.881 --> 01:16:32.384
...that Harry attacked anyone.
- Of course you don't.

01:16:36.138 --> 01:16:38.724
Right. Well, I'll...

01:16:38.891 --> 01:16:42.019
- I'll just wait outside, then.
- Yes.

01:16:45.689 --> 01:16:49.359
- You don't think it was me,
Professor? - No, Harry.

01:16:49.526 --> 01:16:52.029
I do not think it was you.

01:16:53.071 --> 01:16:54.865
But I must ask you...

01:16:55.449 --> 01:16:59.536
...is there something
you wish to tell me?

01:17:06.001 --> 01:17:07.920
No, sir.

01:17:08.086 --> 01:17:09.588
Nothing.

01:17:12.591 --> 01:17:14.760
Very well, then.

01:17:14.927 --> 01:17:16.720
Off you go.

01:17:54.675 --> 01:17:58.220
Everything's set. We just need a
bit of who you're changing into.

01:17:58.387 --> 01:18:00.097
Crabbe and Goyle.

01:18:00.264 --> 01:18:03.058
We also need to make sure that
the real Crabbe and Goyle...

01:18:03.225 --> 01:18:06.436
...can't burst in on us while
we're interrogating Malfoy.

01:18:06.770 --> 01:18:09.481
- How?
- I've got it all worked out.

01:18:09.648 --> 01:18:12.234
I filled these with a
simple Sleeping Draught.

01:18:12.401 --> 01:18:15.154
Simple, but powerful.

01:18:15.362 --> 01:18:17.531
Now, once they're asleep...

01:18:17.698 --> 01:18:20.909
...hide them in the broomstick cupboard
and pull out a few of their hairs...

01:18:21.076 --> 01:18:22.953
...and put on their uniforms.

01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:26.415
- Whose hair are you ripping out,
then? - I've already got mine.

01:18:26.582 --> 01:18:29.751
Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin.

01:18:29.918 --> 01:18:32.087
I got this off her robes.

01:18:32.254 --> 01:18:34.882
I'm going to go check on
the Polyjuice Potion.

01:18:35.048 --> 01:18:37.759
Make sure that Crabbe
and Goyle find these.

01:18:49.897 --> 01:18:52.274
Ron, maybe I should do it.

01:18:52.441 --> 01:18:54.485
Yeah. Right.

01:18:56.695 --> 01:18:58.530
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

01:19:08.665 --> 01:19:10.292
Cool.

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:35.275
How thick could you get?

01:19:35.442 --> 01:19:37.402
Come on, let's get them.

01:19:40.072 --> 01:19:44.076
We'll have exactly one hour before
we change back into ourselves.

01:19:52.251 --> 01:19:54.211
Add the hairs.

01:19:58.757 --> 01:20:00.509
Essence of Crabbe.

01:20:00.676 --> 01:20:02.553
Cheers.

01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:13.689
I think I'm gonna be sick.

01:20:16.608 --> 01:20:18.443
Me too.

01:21:03.322 --> 01:21:05.073
Harry?

01:21:05.532 --> 01:21:07.075
Ron.

01:21:07.826 --> 01:21:09.995
Bloody hell!

01:21:10.787 --> 01:21:13.081
We still sound like ourselves.

01:21:13.248 --> 01:21:15.000
You need to sound
more like Crabbe.

01:21:16.168 --> 01:21:18.462
- Bloody hell.
- Excellent.

01:21:18.795 --> 01:21:21.298
- But where's Hermione?
- I...

01:21:21.465 --> 01:21:24.468
I don't think I'm going.
You go on without me.

01:21:24.635 --> 01:21:26.345
Hermione, are you okay?

01:21:26.512 --> 01:21:29.348
Just go. You're wasting time.

01:21:31.433 --> 01:21:33.101
Come on.

01:21:36.605 --> 01:21:39.942
I think the Slytherin
common room's this way.

01:21:42.945 --> 01:21:45.405
Excuse me.

01:21:47.199 --> 01:21:49.117
What are you doing d...?

01:21:49.284 --> 01:21:51.370
I mean, what are you
doing down here?

01:21:53.288 --> 01:21:55.999
I happen to be a school prefect.

01:21:56.166 --> 01:22:00.629
You, on the other hand, have no business
wandering the corridors at night.

01:22:01.213 --> 01:22:03.048
What are your names again?

01:22:03.215 --> 01:22:07.219
- I'm... - Crabbe, Goyle,
where have you been?

01:22:07.386 --> 01:22:10.430
Pigging out in the Great
Hall all this time?

01:22:11.932 --> 01:22:14.226
Why are you wearing glasses?

01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:17.896
- Reading.
- Reading?

01:22:19.064 --> 01:22:21.358
I didn't know you could read.

01:22:24.236 --> 01:22:26.321
And what are you doing
down here, Weasley?

01:22:26.488 --> 01:22:28.532
Mind your attitude, Malfoy.

01:22:37.332 --> 01:22:39.334
Well, sit down.

01:22:42.129 --> 01:22:45.966
You'd never know the Weasleys were
pure-bloods, the way they behave.

01:22:46.175 --> 01:22:50.012
They're an embarrassment to the
wizarding world. All of them.

01:22:50.846 --> 01:22:53.140
What's wrong with you, Crabbe?

01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:57.102
Stomachache.

01:22:59.104 --> 01:23:03.942
<i>I'm surprised the Daily Prophet hasn't
done a report on all these attacks.</i>

01:23:04.109 --> 01:23:06.570
I suppose Dumbledore is
trying to hush it all up.

01:23:06.862 --> 01:23:09.239
Father always said Dumbledore
was the worst thing...

01:23:09.406 --> 01:23:13.202
...that ever happened to
this place. - You're wrong!

01:23:20.709 --> 01:23:21.877
What?

01:23:22.044 --> 01:23:25.714
You think there's someone here
who's worse than Dumbledore?

01:23:25.881 --> 01:23:28.300
Well? Do you?

01:23:28.842 --> 01:23:30.719
Harry Potter?

01:23:37.267 --> 01:23:38.685
Good one, Goyle.

01:23:38.852 --> 01:23:40.395
You're absolutely right.

01:23:41.063 --> 01:23:42.898
Saint Potter.

01:23:43.899 --> 01:23:46.693
And people actually think that
he's the Heir of Slytherin?

01:23:50.447 --> 01:23:53.075
But then you must have some
idea who's behind it all.

01:23:53.242 --> 01:23:56.912
You know I don't, Goyle.
I told you yesterday.

01:23:57.913 --> 01:24:00.415
How many times do I
have to tell you?

01:24:01.416 --> 01:24:03.252
Is this yours?

01:24:07.714 --> 01:24:10.092
But my father did say this.

01:24:10.467 --> 01:24:13.387
It's been 50 years since
the Chamber was opened.

01:24:13.554 --> 01:24:17.933
He wouldn't tell me who opened it.
Only that they were expelled.

01:24:18.225 --> 01:24:22.896
The last time the Chamber of Secrets
was opened, a Mudblood died.

01:24:23.063 --> 01:24:27.359
So it's only a matter of time before
one of them is killed this time.

01:24:27.943 --> 01:24:29.778
As for me...

01:24:29.945 --> 01:24:32.114
...I hope it's Granger.

01:24:32.281 --> 01:24:34.491
What's the matter with you two?

01:24:34.658 --> 01:24:37.161
You're acting very odd.

01:24:37.327 --> 01:24:39.538
It's his stomachache.

01:24:39.705 --> 01:24:41.790
Calm down.

01:24:45.961 --> 01:24:47.963
Scar.

01:24:51.550 --> 01:24:52.968
Hair.

01:24:59.141 --> 01:25:01.518
Hey! Where are you going?

01:25:04.521 --> 01:25:05.814
That was close.

01:25:05.981 --> 01:25:08.400
Hermione, come out. We've
got loads to tell you.

01:25:08.567 --> 01:25:10.444
Go away.

01:25:10.944 --> 01:25:14.823
Wait till you see. It's awful.

01:25:16.783 --> 01:25:18.535
Hermione?

01:25:18.702 --> 01:25:20.329
Are you okay?

01:25:22.372 --> 01:25:24.166
Do you remember
me telling you...

01:25:24.333 --> 01:25:27.503
...that the Polyjuice Potion was
only for human transformations?

01:25:27.669 --> 01:25:31.799
It was cat hair I plucked off
Millicent Bulstrode's robes.

01:25:34.176 --> 01:25:35.719
Look at my face.

01:25:36.845 --> 01:25:39.306
Look at your tail.

01:25:45.854 --> 01:25:47.314
Have you spoken to Hermione?

01:25:47.481 --> 01:25:50.025
She should be out of
hospital in a few days...

01:25:50.192 --> 01:25:53.028
...when she stops
coughing up fur balls.

01:25:57.783 --> 01:25:59.535
What's this?

01:26:04.122 --> 01:26:05.207
Yuck!

01:26:05.374 --> 01:26:08.168
Looks like Moaning Myrtle's
flooded the bathroom.

01:26:24.393 --> 01:26:28.522
- Come to throw something else at me?
- Why would I throw something at you?

01:26:28.939 --> 01:26:33.026
Don't ask me. Here I am,
minding my own business...

01:26:33.193 --> 01:26:36.822
...and someone thinks it's
funny to throw a book at me.

01:26:37.030 --> 01:26:39.908
But it can't hurt if someone
throws something at you.

01:26:40.075 --> 01:26:42.494
I mean, it'll just go
right through you.

01:26:43.537 --> 01:26:47.916
Sure! Let's all throw books at
Myrtle because she can't feel it.

01:26:48.083 --> 01:26:50.711
Ten points if you get
it through her stomach!

01:26:50.878 --> 01:26:54.381
Fifty points if it
goes through her head!

01:26:54.882 --> 01:26:59.303
- But who threw it at you, anyway?
- I don't know. I didn't see them.

01:26:59.636 --> 01:27:03.891
I was just sitting in the
U-bend, thinking about death...

01:27:04.099 --> 01:27:07.769
...and it fell through
the top of my head.

01:27:37.925 --> 01:27:40.427
"Tom Marvolo Riddle."

01:28:10.290 --> 01:28:12.626
My name...

01:28:12.793 --> 01:28:15.712
...is Harry...

01:28:17.339 --> 01:28:19.466
...Potter.

01:28:32.688 --> 01:28:37.860
Do you know anything...

01:28:38.694 --> 01:28:44.367
...about the Chamber of Secrets?

01:28:55.502 --> 01:28:57.421
Can you...

01:28:58.672 --> 01:29:00.966
...tell me?

01:30:03.237 --> 01:30:06.657
Excuse me. Could you tell
me what's going on here?

01:30:10.118 --> 01:30:12.454
Are you Tom Riddle?

01:30:12.621 --> 01:30:14.414
Hello, can you hear me?

01:30:34.977 --> 01:30:36.728
Riddle!

01:30:37.312 --> 01:30:38.856
Come.

01:30:39.022 --> 01:30:41.024
Professor Dumbledore.

01:30:43.193 --> 01:30:45.362
Dumbledore?

01:30:46.655 --> 01:30:50.159
It is not wise to be wandering
around this late hour, Tom.

01:30:50.325 --> 01:30:53.662
Yes, Professor. I suppose I...

01:30:53.829 --> 01:30:55.998
I had to see for myself
if the rumors were true.

01:30:56.582 --> 01:30:59.501
I'm afraid they are, Tom.
They are true.

01:30:59.668 --> 01:31:02.504
About the school as well? I
don't have a home to go to.

01:31:02.671 --> 01:31:05.507
They wouldn't really close
Hogwarts, would they, Professor?

01:31:05.674 --> 01:31:08.218
I understand, Tom,
but I'm afraid...

01:31:09.011 --> 01:31:11.930
...Headmaster Dippet
may have no choice.

01:31:12.097 --> 01:31:16.602
Sir, if it all stopped, if the
person responsible was caught...

01:31:18.854 --> 01:31:20.981
Is there something...

01:31:21.899 --> 01:31:23.901
...you wish to tell me?

01:31:25.110 --> 01:31:27.654
No, sir. Nothing.

01:31:34.411 --> 01:31:37.456
Very well, then. Off you go.

01:31:37.623 --> 01:31:39.500
Good night, sir.

01:32:15.619 --> 01:32:18.539
- Let's get you out of there.
- Evening, Hagrid.

01:32:18.872 --> 01:32:23.210
I'm going to have to turn you in. I don't
think you meant it to kill anyone...

01:32:23.377 --> 01:32:25.671
You can't. You don't understand.

01:32:25.879 --> 01:32:29.007
The dead girl's parents will be here
tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do...

01:32:29.174 --> 01:32:32.094
...is make sure the thing that killed
their daughter is slaughtered.

01:32:32.344 --> 01:32:35.472
It wasn't him. Aragog never
killed no one. Never.

01:32:35.806 --> 01:32:37.975
Monsters don't make
good pets, Hagrid.

01:32:38.142 --> 01:32:39.768
- Now, stand aside.
- No!

01:32:39.935 --> 01:32:41.895
- Stand aside, Hagrid.
- No!

01:32:42.062 --> 01:32:43.689
<i>Cistem Aperio!</i>

01:32:50.654 --> 01:32:52.990
<i>Arania Exumai!</i>

01:32:53.866 --> 01:32:55.325
Aragog!

01:32:55.492 --> 01:32:56.743
Aragog!

01:32:57.286 --> 01:32:58.662
I can't let you go.

01:32:59.204 --> 01:33:02.499
They'll have your wand for this,
Hagrid. You'll be expelled.

01:33:05.043 --> 01:33:06.920
Hagrid!

01:33:36.950 --> 01:33:41.079
It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the
Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago.

01:33:41.246 --> 01:33:44.208
It can't be Hagrid.
It just can't be.

01:33:44.374 --> 01:33:48.462
We don't even know this Tom Riddle. He
sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch.

01:33:48.629 --> 01:33:52.132
The monster had killed somebody,
Ron. What would any of us have done?

01:33:52.424 --> 01:33:56.386
Look, Hagrid's our friend. Why don't
we just go and ask him about it?

01:33:56.595 --> 01:33:59.264
That would be a cheerful visit.
"Hello, Hagrid.

01:33:59.431 --> 01:34:03.268
Tell us, have you been setting anything mad
and hairy loose in the castle lately?"

01:34:03.435 --> 01:34:06.647
Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be
talking about me, now, would you?

01:34:06.939 --> 01:34:07.981
No.

01:34:12.486 --> 01:34:14.112
What's that you've got, Hagrid?

01:34:14.571 --> 01:34:19.117
It's Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.
For the Mandrakes, you know.

01:34:19.284 --> 01:34:22.955
Now, according to Professor Sprout,
they've still got a bit of growing to do.

01:34:23.121 --> 01:34:26.625
But once their acne's cleared up,
we'll chop them up and stew them...

01:34:26.792 --> 01:34:30.087
...and then we'll get those people
down at the hospital un-Petrified.

01:34:31.547 --> 01:34:34.424
In the meantime,
though, you three...

01:34:34.591 --> 01:34:37.761
...had best be looking after
yourselves. All right?

01:34:45.644 --> 01:34:47.563
Hello, Neville.

01:34:48.647 --> 01:34:51.150
Harry, I don't know who did
it, but you'd better come.

01:34:51.525 --> 01:34:53.235
Come on!

01:35:15.799 --> 01:35:19.803
It had to be a Gryffindor.
Nobody else knows our password.

01:35:19.970 --> 01:35:22.222
Unless it wasn't a student.

01:35:22.389 --> 01:35:25.809
Whoever it was, they must have
been looking for something.

01:35:25.976 --> 01:35:27.394
And they found it.

01:35:28.145 --> 01:35:30.647
Tom Riddle's diary is gone.

01:35:32.232 --> 01:35:33.525
All right, listen up.

01:35:33.692 --> 01:35:36.612
We play our game, Hufflepuff
doesn't stand a chance.

01:35:36.778 --> 01:35:38.655
We're stronger,
quicker and smarter.

01:35:38.822 --> 01:35:41.825
Not to mention they're dead scared
that Harry will Petrify them...

01:35:41.992 --> 01:35:45.496
...if they fly anywhere
near him. - Well, that too.

01:35:46.705 --> 01:35:48.248
Professor McGonagall.

01:35:48.415 --> 01:35:51.460
- This match has been canceled.
- We can't cancel Quidditch.

01:35:51.627 --> 01:35:56.590
Silence, Wood. You and your teammates
will go to Gryffindor Tower. Now.

01:35:56.757 --> 01:35:59.426
Potter, you and I will
find Mr. Weasley.

01:35:59.802 --> 01:36:02.346
There's something the
both of you have to see.

01:36:04.431 --> 01:36:08.018
I warn you. This could
be a wee bit of a shock.

01:36:16.401 --> 01:36:17.611
Hermione!

01:36:17.778 --> 01:36:19.571
She was found near
the library...

01:36:20.823 --> 01:36:22.866
...along with this.

01:36:24.326 --> 01:36:27.162
Does it mean anything
to either of you?

01:36:27.329 --> 01:36:28.789
No.

01:36:43.011 --> 01:36:45.347
Could I have your
attention, please?

01:36:45.514 --> 01:36:51.145
Because of recent events, these new rules
will be put into effect immediately.

01:36:51.478 --> 01:36:56.608
"All students will return to their house
common rooms by 6:00 every evening."

01:36:56.775 --> 01:37:00.863
All students will be escorted
to each lesson by a teacher.

01:37:01.029 --> 01:37:04.032
"No exceptions."

01:37:04.700 --> 01:37:06.743
I should tell you this.

01:37:06.910 --> 01:37:11.039
Unless the culprit behind
these attacks is caught...

01:37:11.582 --> 01:37:14.751
...it is likely the
school will be closed.

01:37:26.263 --> 01:37:29.224
We've got to talk to Hagrid,
Ron. I can't believe it's him...

01:37:29.391 --> 01:37:31.685
...but if he did set the
monster loose last time...

01:37:31.852 --> 01:37:35.022
...he'll know how to get inside the
Chamber of Secrets. That's a start.

01:37:35.189 --> 01:37:36.440
But you heard McGonagall.

01:37:36.607 --> 01:37:39.902
We're not allowed to leave
the tower except for class.

01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:42.821
I think it's time to get my
dad's old cloak out again.

01:37:56.460 --> 01:37:58.170
Who's there?

01:38:01.965 --> 01:38:03.550
Hello?

01:38:04.176 --> 01:38:05.719
Hello?

01:38:06.887 --> 01:38:11.183
- What's that for?
- Nothing. I was expecting...

01:38:11.350 --> 01:38:15.229
It doesn't matter. Come on in.
I just made a pot of tea.

01:38:17.981 --> 01:38:20.275
Hagrid, are you okay?

01:38:20.442 --> 01:38:23.320
I'm fine. I'm all right.

01:38:24.279 --> 01:38:25.989
Did you hear about Hermione?

01:38:26.490 --> 01:38:30.160
Yeah. I heard about
that, all right.

01:38:30.494 --> 01:38:34.164
Look, we have to
ask you something.

01:38:35.833 --> 01:38:39.336
Do you know who's opened
the Chamber of Secrets?

01:38:41.672 --> 01:38:43.966
What you had to understand
about that is...

01:38:45.634 --> 01:38:47.219
Quick, under the cloak.

01:38:47.886 --> 01:38:50.973
Don't say a word. Be
quiet, both of you.

01:38:57.396 --> 01:39:00.482
- Professor Dumbledore, sir.
- Good evening, Hagrid.

01:39:00.649 --> 01:39:03.068
I wonder, could we...?

01:39:03.235 --> 01:39:05.737
Of course. Come in. Come in.

01:39:05.904 --> 01:39:07.281
That's Dad's boss.

01:39:07.447 --> 01:39:11.034
Cornelius Fudge,
Minister of Magic.

01:39:11.201 --> 01:39:15.581
Bad business, Hagrid, very
bad business. Had to come.

01:39:15.747 --> 01:39:19.001
Three attacks on Muggle-borns.
Things have gone far enough.

01:39:19.168 --> 01:39:22.379
- The Ministry's got to act.
- But I never...

01:39:22.588 --> 01:39:24.381
You know I never, Professor.

01:39:24.548 --> 01:39:27.634
I want it understood,
Cornelius...

01:39:27.801 --> 01:39:29.636
...that Hagrid...

01:39:29.803 --> 01:39:32.097
...has my full confidence.

01:39:32.264 --> 01:39:36.059
Albus, look, Hagrid's
record is against him.

01:39:36.226 --> 01:39:38.770
- I've got to take him.
- Take me?

01:39:38.937 --> 01:39:41.231
Take me where? Not
Azkaban prison.

01:39:41.523 --> 01:39:45.277
I'm afraid we have
no choice, Hagrid.

01:39:45.903 --> 01:39:47.821
Already here, Fudge?

01:39:47.988 --> 01:39:49.323
Good.

01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:52.993
What are you doing here?
Get out of my house!

01:39:53.660 --> 01:39:55.204
Believe me...

01:39:55.496 --> 01:39:59.708
...I take absolutely no
pleasure being inside your...

01:40:01.585 --> 01:40:03.796
You call this a house?

01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:05.923
No.

01:40:06.089 --> 01:40:09.968
I simply called up the school and
was told the headmaster was here.

01:40:10.135 --> 01:40:14.223
Well, what exactly is it
that you want with me?

01:40:14.765 --> 01:40:19.520
The other governors and I have decided
it's time for you to step aside.

01:40:21.146 --> 01:40:24.066
This is an order of suspension.

01:40:29.613 --> 01:40:32.991
You'll find all 12
signatures on it.

01:40:36.870 --> 01:40:41.083
I'm afraid we feel you've
rather lost your touch.

01:40:41.792 --> 01:40:44.128
Well, what, with all
these attacks...

01:40:44.294 --> 01:40:47.089
...there'll be no Muggle-borns
left at Hogwarts.

01:40:47.256 --> 01:40:51.802
I can only imagine what an awful
loss that would be to the school.

01:40:51.969 --> 01:40:54.179
You can't take Professor
Dumbledore away.

01:40:54.471 --> 01:40:57.015
Take him away and the Muggle-borns
won't stand a chance.

01:40:57.182 --> 01:40:59.643
You mark my words,
there'll be killings next!

01:40:59.810 --> 01:41:01.478
You think so?

01:41:01.645 --> 01:41:04.148
Calm yourself, Hagrid.

01:41:05.482 --> 01:41:08.235
If the governors
desire my removal...

01:41:08.402 --> 01:41:12.114
...I will, of
course, step aside.

01:41:13.699 --> 01:41:15.951
However...

01:41:16.618 --> 01:41:21.165
...you will find that help will
always be given at Hogwarts...

01:41:21.331 --> 01:41:23.208
...to those who...

01:41:23.375 --> 01:41:25.711
...ask for it.

01:41:32.509 --> 01:41:34.845
Admirable sentiments.

01:41:35.012 --> 01:41:36.847
Shall we?

01:41:48.942 --> 01:41:50.486
Fudge.

01:41:52.196 --> 01:41:54.031
Come, Hagrid.

01:41:55.157 --> 01:41:56.700
Well?

01:41:57.367 --> 01:41:58.452
If...

01:41:58.869 --> 01:42:01.413
If anybody was looking
for some stuff...

01:42:01.580 --> 01:42:06.460
...then all they'd have to do
would be to follow the spiders.

01:42:06.627 --> 01:42:09.213
Yep. That would lead them right.

01:42:09.379 --> 01:42:11.340
That's all I have to say.

01:42:13.050 --> 01:42:16.804
And someone will need to
feed Fang while I'm away.

01:42:20.182 --> 01:42:22.184
Good boy.

01:42:28.315 --> 01:42:30.442
Hagrid's right.

01:42:30.609 --> 01:42:33.570
With Dumbledore gone,
there'll be an attack a day.

01:42:33.737 --> 01:42:35.405
Look.

01:42:41.453 --> 01:42:43.247
Come on.

01:42:46.959 --> 01:42:49.002
Come on, Fang.

01:43:07.271 --> 01:43:08.647
Come on.

01:43:08.814 --> 01:43:10.107
What?

01:43:10.274 --> 01:43:13.527
You heard what Hagrid said.
"Follow the spiders."

01:43:13.735 --> 01:43:16.363
They're heading to
the Dark Forest.

01:43:18.407 --> 01:43:22.870
Why spiders? Why couldn't it
be "follow the butterflies"?

01:43:58.614 --> 01:44:01.366
Harry, I don't like this.

01:44:06.497 --> 01:44:09.708
- Harry, I don't like
this at all. - Shush!

01:44:21.220 --> 01:44:23.764
Can we go back now?

01:44:23.931 --> 01:44:25.682
Come on.

01:45:15.399 --> 01:45:18.152
Who is it?

01:45:18.819 --> 01:45:19.945
Don't panic.

01:45:20.279 --> 01:45:21.780
Hagrid?

01:45:22.197 --> 01:45:23.782
Is that you?

01:45:24.366 --> 01:45:26.285
We're friends of Hagrid's.

01:45:44.386 --> 01:45:47.598
And you? You're
Aragog, aren't you?

01:45:48.223 --> 01:45:49.516
Yes.

01:45:49.683 --> 01:45:53.479
Hagrid has never sent men
into our hollow before.

01:45:53.645 --> 01:45:56.773
He's in trouble. Up at the
school, there have been attacks.

01:45:57.399 --> 01:45:59.234
They think it's Hagrid.

01:45:59.401 --> 01:46:03.030
They think he opened the Chamber
of Secrets. Like before.

01:46:03.238 --> 01:46:05.574
That's a lie.

01:46:06.033 --> 01:46:08.952
Hagrid never opened the
Chamber of Secrets.

01:46:09.578 --> 01:46:12.456
- Then you're not the monster?
- No.

01:46:12.623 --> 01:46:15.667
The monster was
born in the castle.

01:46:15.876 --> 01:46:21.173
I came to Hagrid from a distant
land in the pocket of a traveler.

01:46:21.799 --> 01:46:23.425
Harry.

01:46:25.344 --> 01:46:29.932
But if you're not the monster, then
what did kill that girl 50 years ago?

01:46:30.098 --> 01:46:33.101
We do not speak of it.

01:46:33.435 --> 01:46:38.982
It is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others.

01:46:39.149 --> 01:46:40.943
But have you seen it?

01:46:41.610 --> 01:46:47.449
I never saw any part of the castle
but the box in which Hagrid kept me.

01:46:47.616 --> 01:46:50.786
The girl was discovered
in a bathroom.

01:46:50.953 --> 01:46:55.457
When I was accused,
Hagrid brought me here.

01:46:55.624 --> 01:46:57.626
- Harry!
- What?

01:47:10.472 --> 01:47:13.475
Well, thank you.

01:47:14.434 --> 01:47:16.603
We'll just go.

01:47:17.062 --> 01:47:18.814
Go?

01:47:19.022 --> 01:47:20.816
I think not.

01:47:20.983 --> 01:47:26.446
My sons and daughters do not
harm Hagrid on my command.

01:47:26.613 --> 01:47:29.032
But I cannot deny
them fresh meat...

01:47:29.199 --> 01:47:33.537
...when it wanders so
willingly into our midst.

01:47:33.704 --> 01:47:37.499
Goodbye, friend of Hagrid.

01:47:37.666 --> 01:47:39.501
Can we panic now?

01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:52.139
Know any spells?

01:47:52.306 --> 01:47:55.476
One, but it's not powerful
enough for all of them.

01:47:55.642 --> 01:47:58.395
Where's Hermione
when you need her?

01:48:11.909 --> 01:48:13.202
Let's go!

01:48:18.332 --> 01:48:20.417
<i>Arania Exumai!</i>

01:48:25.714 --> 01:48:27.049
Go!

01:48:45.025 --> 01:48:47.110
Glad we're out of there.

01:48:54.076 --> 01:48:56.411
<i>Arania Exumai!</i>

01:49:02.126 --> 01:49:05.879
- Thanks for that.
- Don't mention it.

01:49:16.807 --> 01:49:18.976
Get us out of here.

01:49:19.476 --> 01:49:21.145
Now!

01:49:23.230 --> 01:49:27.484
Come on! Come on, move faster!

01:49:30.154 --> 01:49:31.488
Come on! Go!

01:49:49.006 --> 01:49:51.049
Get us in the air.

01:49:52.134 --> 01:49:53.594
The flying gear's jammed!

01:49:57.681 --> 01:50:01.477
- Come on! Pull!
- I'm trying!

01:50:30.798 --> 01:50:33.717
Follow the spiders.
Follow the spiders.

01:50:33.884 --> 01:50:38.222
If Hagrid ever gets out of
Azkaban, I'll kill him.

01:50:52.236 --> 01:50:55.447
I mean, what was the point
of sending us in there?

01:50:55.614 --> 01:51:00.244
- What have we found out?
- We know one thing.

01:51:00.410 --> 01:51:03.789
Hagrid never opened the
Chamber of Secrets.

01:51:03.997 --> 01:51:05.999
He was innocent.

01:51:21.473 --> 01:51:23.934
Wish you were here, Hermione.

01:51:24.476 --> 01:51:26.770
We need you.

01:51:27.688 --> 01:51:29.773
Now more than ever.

01:51:46.707 --> 01:51:50.127
- What's that?
- Ron...

01:51:50.961 --> 01:51:55.424
This is why Hermione was in the
library the day she was attacked.

01:51:55.966 --> 01:51:57.217
Come on.

01:51:57.885 --> 01:52:00.846
"Of the many fearsome beasts
that roam our land..."

01:52:01.013 --> 01:52:05.642
...none is more deadly than the basilisk.
Capable of living for hundreds of years...

01:52:05.809 --> 01:52:09.605
...instant death awaits any who
meet this giant serpent's eye.

01:52:09.771 --> 01:52:12.774
"Spiders flee before
it." Ron, this is it.

01:52:12.941 --> 01:52:15.736
The monster in the Chamber
of Secrets is a basilisk.

01:52:15.903 --> 01:52:19.823
That's why I can hear it speak.
It's a snake.

01:52:20.157 --> 01:52:25.454
But if it kills by looking people in
the eye, why is it no one's dead?

01:52:36.089 --> 01:52:39.009
Because no one did
look it in the eye.

01:52:40.969 --> 01:52:43.555
Not directly, at least.

01:52:44.807 --> 01:52:47.017
Colin saw it through his camera.

01:52:47.184 --> 01:52:51.230
Justin... Justin must have seen the
basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick.

01:52:51.396 --> 01:52:55.400
Nick got the full blast of it. But
he's a ghost, he couldn't die again.

01:52:55.567 --> 01:52:58.695
And Hermione had the mirror.

01:52:58.862 --> 01:53:02.241
I bet you she was using it to look
around corners in case it came along.

01:53:02.407 --> 01:53:03.700
And Mrs. Norris?

01:53:03.867 --> 01:53:07.371
I'm pretty sure she didn't have
a camera or a mirror, Harry.

01:53:08.914 --> 01:53:10.791
The water.

01:53:11.250 --> 01:53:16.839
There was water on the floor that night.
She only saw the basilisk's reflection.

01:53:22.970 --> 01:53:24.888
"Spiders flee before it."

01:53:25.055 --> 01:53:28.809
- It all fits. - How's a
basilisk been getting around?

01:53:28.976 --> 01:53:31.812
A dirty, great snake.
Someone would have seen it.

01:53:31.979 --> 01:53:37.651
- Hermione's answered that too. -
Pipes? It's using the plumbing.

01:53:37.818 --> 01:53:42.072
Remember what Aragog said
about that girl 50 years ago?

01:53:42.239 --> 01:53:46.493
She died in a bathroom?
What if she never left?

01:53:47.161 --> 01:53:48.495
Moaning Myrtle.

01:53:49.455 --> 01:53:53.500
<i>All students are to return to
their house dormitories at once.</i>

01:53:53.667 --> 01:53:57.087
<i>All teachers to the second-floor
corridor immediately.</i>

01:54:02.092 --> 01:54:07.931
As you can see, the Heir of
Slytherin has left another message.

01:54:08.098 --> 01:54:10.309
Our worst fear has
been realized.

01:54:10.476 --> 01:54:15.063
A student has been taken by the
monster into the Chamber itself.

01:54:16.106 --> 01:54:21.778
The students must be sent home. I'm
afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.

01:54:24.156 --> 01:54:26.617
So sorry. Dozed off.
What have I missed?

01:54:26.783 --> 01:54:31.121
A girl has been snatched by the monster,
Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.

01:54:31.288 --> 01:54:34.249
- My moment? - Weren't you
saying just last night...

01:54:34.416 --> 01:54:38.962
...that you've known all along where the
entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?

01:54:40.297 --> 01:54:45.803
That's settled. We'll leave you to
deal with the monster, Gilderoy.

01:54:45.969 --> 01:54:51.141
- Your skills, after all,
are legend. - Very well.

01:54:51.308 --> 01:54:54.520
I'll just be in my
office getting...

01:54:55.354 --> 01:54:57.314
Getting ready.

01:55:00.234 --> 01:55:03.445
Who is it that the
monster's taken, Minerva?

01:55:03.612 --> 01:55:05.447
Ginny Weasley.

01:55:16.834 --> 01:55:19.920
"Her skeleton will lie
in the Chamber forever."

01:55:23.966 --> 01:55:25.759
Ginny.

01:55:27.845 --> 01:55:31.348
Lockhart may be useless, but he's going
to try and get into the Chamber.

01:55:31.515 --> 01:55:34.226
At least we can tell
him what we know.

01:55:35.561 --> 01:55:38.147
Professor, we have some
information for you.

01:55:39.898 --> 01:55:41.859
Are you going somewhere?

01:55:42.025 --> 01:55:45.154
Well, yes. Urgent call.
Unavoidable. Got to go.

01:55:45.320 --> 01:55:48.532
- What about my sister?
- Well...

01:55:48.866 --> 01:55:52.369
As to that, most unfortunate.
No one regrets more than I.

01:55:52.536 --> 01:55:56.540
You're the Defense Against the Dark
Arts teacher. You can't go now.

01:55:56.707 --> 01:55:59.710
I must say, when I took the job, there
was nothing in the description...

01:55:59.877 --> 01:56:01.044
You're running away?

01:56:01.211 --> 01:56:04.006
- After all you did in your
books? - Books can be misleading.

01:56:04.173 --> 01:56:06.717
- You wrote them. - My dear
boy, use your common sense.

01:56:06.884 --> 01:56:11.305
My books wouldn't have sold as well if
people didn't think I'd done those things.

01:56:11.889 --> 01:56:13.474
You're a fraud.

01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:16.435
You've been taking credit for
what other wizards have done.

01:56:16.602 --> 01:56:18.562
Is there anything you can do?

01:56:18.729 --> 01:56:23.442
Yes, now you mention it. I'm
rather gifted with Memory Charms.

01:56:23.609 --> 01:56:26.111
Otherwise, all those wizards
would have gone blabbing.

01:56:26.278 --> 01:56:29.406
I'd never have
sold another book.

01:56:29.573 --> 01:56:35.287
In fact, I'm going to have
to do the same to you.

01:56:35.788 --> 01:56:38.582
Don't even think about it.

01:56:49.426 --> 01:56:50.886
Who's there?

01:56:53.305 --> 01:56:55.349
Hello, Harry.

01:56:56.266 --> 01:57:01.438
- What do you want?
- To ask you how you died.

01:57:03.816 --> 01:57:06.276
It was dreadful.

01:57:06.443 --> 01:57:10.113
It happened right here
in this very cubicle.

01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:14.326
I'd hidden because Olive Hornby
was teasing me about my glasses.

01:57:14.493 --> 01:57:19.414
I was crying, and then I
heard somebody come in.

01:57:19.581 --> 01:57:25.321
- Who was it, Myrtle? - I
don't know. I was distraught!

01:57:27.214 --> 01:57:30.634
But they said something funny,
a kind of made-up language.

01:57:30.801 --> 01:57:36.141
And I realized it was a boy, so I unlocked
the door to tell him to go away and...

01:57:38.308 --> 01:57:43.147
- ...I died.
- Just like that? How?

01:57:43.313 --> 01:57:47.818
I just remember seeing a pair
of great, big, yellow eyes...

01:57:47.985 --> 01:57:51.822
...over there by that sink.

01:58:16.930 --> 01:58:18.974
This is it.

01:58:19.850 --> 01:58:24.688
This is it, Ron. I think this is the
entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.

01:58:26.690 --> 01:58:31.528
Say something. Harry, say
something in Parseltongue.

01:59:23.080 --> 01:59:27.167
Excellent, Harry. Good work.
Well, then, I'll just be...

01:59:27.334 --> 01:59:29.586
There's no need for me to stay.

01:59:30.212 --> 01:59:32.089
Yes, there is.

01:59:33.924 --> 01:59:37.010
- You first. - Now, boys,
what good will it do?

01:59:37.177 --> 01:59:38.512
Better you than us.

01:59:39.721 --> 01:59:42.641
But... Obviously, yes.

01:59:46.937 --> 01:59:49.648
Sure you don't want
to test it first?

01:59:56.446 --> 01:59:59.700
It's really quite
filthy down here.

02:00:00.159 --> 02:00:04.705
- All right. Let's go.
- Oh, Harry?

02:00:05.122 --> 02:00:10.043
If you die down there, you're
welcome to share my toilet.

02:00:12.588 --> 02:00:14.548
Thanks, Myrtle.

02:00:43.660 --> 02:00:48.832
Now, remember: Any sign of movement,
close your eyes straightaway.

02:00:49.792 --> 02:00:51.460
Go on.

02:00:55.172 --> 02:00:56.507
This way.

02:01:03.514 --> 02:01:08.769
- What's this?
- It looks like a snake.

02:01:08.936 --> 02:01:12.606
- It's a snakeskin.
- Bloody hell.

02:01:12.773 --> 02:01:18.570
Whatever shed this must
be 60 feet long. Or more.

02:01:20.489 --> 02:01:23.450
Heart of a lion, this one.

02:01:27.162 --> 02:01:31.834
The adventure ends here, boys.
But don't fret.

02:01:33.752 --> 02:01:39.216
The world will know our story. How
I was too late to save the girl.

02:01:39.550 --> 02:01:43.053
How you two tragically
lost your minds...

02:01:43.220 --> 02:01:46.223
...at the sight of
her mangled body.

02:01:47.057 --> 02:01:48.517
So...

02:01:49.643 --> 02:01:51.979
You first, Mr. Potter.

02:01:52.229 --> 02:01:55.399
Say goodbye to your memories.

02:01:57.442 --> 02:01:59.403
<i>Obliviate!</i>

02:02:33.312 --> 02:02:36.440
- Ron! Ron, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

02:02:40.194 --> 02:02:41.945
Hello.

02:02:42.613 --> 02:02:44.448
Who are you?

02:02:45.824 --> 02:02:48.494
- Ron Weasley.
- Really?

02:02:48.660 --> 02:02:51.538
And who am I?

02:02:53.290 --> 02:02:57.628
Lockhart's Memory Charm backfired.
He hasn't got a clue who he is.

02:02:57.961 --> 02:03:02.466
It's an odd sort of
place, isn't it?

02:03:02.633 --> 02:03:04.760
Do you live here?

02:03:05.469 --> 02:03:07.971
- No.
- Really?

02:03:12.559 --> 02:03:14.353
- What do I do now?
- You wait here...

02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:17.481
...and try and shift some of this
rock so we can get back through.

02:03:17.648 --> 02:03:21.318
- I'll go on and find Ginny.
- Okay.

02:04:54.536 --> 02:04:58.415
Ginny! Ginny, please don't
be dead. Wake up, wake up.

02:04:58.916 --> 02:05:01.001
Please wake up.

02:05:01.251 --> 02:05:03.420
She won't wake.

02:05:08.884 --> 02:05:13.222
Tom. Tom Riddle. What do
you mean, she won't wake?

02:05:13.388 --> 02:05:16.767
- She's not...? - She's
still alive, but only just.

02:05:17.768 --> 02:05:20.062
- Are you a ghost?
- A memory...

02:05:20.229 --> 02:05:22.606
...preserved in a
diary for 50 years.

02:05:25.275 --> 02:05:30.489
She's cold as ice. Ginny,
please don't be dead. Wake up.

02:05:30.656 --> 02:05:33.075
You've got to help me, Tom.
There's a basilisk.

02:05:33.242 --> 02:05:35.828
It won't come until it's called.

02:05:38.622 --> 02:05:41.458
- Give me my wand, Tom.
- You won't be needing it.

02:05:42.501 --> 02:05:45.921
- We've got to go. We've got to save
her. - I'm afraid I can't do that.

02:05:46.088 --> 02:05:50.134
You see, as poor Ginny grows
weaker, I grow stronger.

02:05:51.468 --> 02:05:55.973
Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley
who opened the Chamber of Secrets.

02:05:56.140 --> 02:05:58.475
No. She couldn't. She wouldn't.

02:05:58.642 --> 02:06:01.854
It was Ginny who set the basilisk
on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat...

02:06:02.020 --> 02:06:04.481
...Ginny who wrote the threatening
messages on the walls.

02:06:04.648 --> 02:06:07.943
- But why?
- Because I told her to.

02:06:08.110 --> 02:06:13.073
You'll find I can be very persuasive.
Not that she knew what she was doing.

02:06:13.240 --> 02:06:16.577
She was, shall we say,
in a kind of trance.

02:06:17.119 --> 02:06:19.621
Still, the power of the
diary began to scare her.

02:06:19.788 --> 02:06:22.166
She tried to dispose of it
in the girls' bathroom.

02:06:22.332 --> 02:06:26.670
And then who should
find it but you?

02:06:26.837 --> 02:06:29.965
The very person I was
most anxious to meet.

02:06:30.549 --> 02:06:32.634
And why did you want to meet me?

02:06:33.010 --> 02:06:36.388
I knew I had to talk to
you, meet you if I could.

02:06:36.555 --> 02:06:39.850
So I decided to show you my capture
of that brainless oaf Hagrid...

02:06:40.017 --> 02:06:43.187
- ...to gain your trust.
- Hagrid's my friend.

02:06:44.104 --> 02:06:48.692
- And you framed him, didn't you? -
It was my word against Hagrid's.

02:06:48.859 --> 02:06:52.154
Only Dumbledore seemed to
think he was innocent.

02:06:52.321 --> 02:06:54.490
I'll bet Dumbledore saw
right through you.

02:06:54.656 --> 02:06:58.118
He certainly kept an annoyingly
close watch on me after that.

02:06:58.285 --> 02:07:01.580
I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the
Chamber again while I was at school...

02:07:01.747 --> 02:07:03.582
...so I decided to leave
behind a diary...

02:07:03.749 --> 02:07:05.876
...preserving my 16-year-old
self in its pages...

02:07:06.043 --> 02:07:08.712
...so that one day I would
be able to lead another...

02:07:08.879 --> 02:07:11.715
...to finish Salazar
Slytherin's noble work.

02:07:11.882 --> 02:07:14.134
Well, you haven't
finished it this time.

02:07:14.301 --> 02:07:17.262
In a few hours, the Mandrake
Draught will be ready.

02:07:17.429 --> 02:07:20.182
And everyone who was Petrified
will be all right again.

02:07:20.557 --> 02:07:25.813
Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods
doesn't matter to me anymore.

02:07:26.063 --> 02:07:30.859
For many months now, my
new target has been you.

02:07:32.319 --> 02:07:35.906
How is it that a baby with no
extraordinary magical talent...

02:07:36.073 --> 02:07:38.742
...was able to defeat the
greatest wizard of all time?

02:07:39.076 --> 02:07:42.037
How did you escape with
nothing but a scar...

02:07:42.204 --> 02:07:44.581
...while Lord Voldemort's
powers were destroyed?

02:07:44.748 --> 02:07:48.919
Why do you care how I escaped?
Voldemort was after your time.

02:07:49.086 --> 02:07:54.992
Voldemort is my past,
present and future.

02:08:15.988 --> 02:08:19.450
You. You're the
Heir of Slytherin.

02:08:22.619 --> 02:08:26.206
- You're Voldemort.
- Surely you didn't think...

02:08:26.373 --> 02:08:30.878
...I was going to keep my
filthy Muggle father's name?

02:08:31.044 --> 02:08:35.215
No. I fashioned myself a new name, a
name I knew wizards everywhere...

02:08:35.382 --> 02:08:39.595
...would fear to speak when I became
the greatest sorcerer in the world.

02:08:39.761 --> 02:08:42.931
Albus Dumbledore is the
greatest sorcerer in the world.

02:08:43.098 --> 02:08:46.477
Dumbledore's been driven out of this
castle by the mere memory of me.

02:08:46.685 --> 02:08:51.732
He'll never be gone. Not as long as
those who remain are loyal to him.

02:08:58.113 --> 02:08:59.156
Fawkes?

02:09:15.422 --> 02:09:19.009
So this is what Dumbledore
sends his great defender.

02:09:19.176 --> 02:09:22.846
A songbird and an old hat.

02:09:36.151 --> 02:09:40.697
Let's match the power of Lord
Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin...

02:09:40.864 --> 02:09:44.868
...against the
famous Harry Potter.

02:09:58.215 --> 02:10:02.553
Parseltongue won't save you
now, Potter. It only obeys me.

02:10:32.749 --> 02:10:34.293
No!

02:10:34.751 --> 02:10:39.256
Your bird may have blinded the
basilisk, but it can still hear you.

02:12:21.233 --> 02:12:24.528
Yes, Potter. The process
is nearly complete.

02:12:24.695 --> 02:12:29.616
In a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be
dead, and I will cease to be a memory.

02:12:29.783 --> 02:12:32.453
Lord Voldemort will return...

02:12:32.828 --> 02:12:37.040
...very much alive.

02:12:37.749 --> 02:12:39.168
Ginny?

02:14:55.512 --> 02:14:57.097
Remarkable, isn't it...

02:14:57.264 --> 02:15:01.268
...how quickly the venom of the
basilisk penetrates the body?

02:15:01.435 --> 02:15:04.104
I'd guess you have little
more than a minute to live.

02:15:04.438 --> 02:15:08.484
You'll be with your dear
Mudblood mother soon, Harry.

02:15:13.489 --> 02:15:17.159
Funny, the damage a silly
little book can do...

02:15:17.326 --> 02:15:22.372
...especially in the hands
of a silly little girl.

02:15:25.209 --> 02:15:27.044
What are you doing?

02:15:29.880 --> 02:15:32.007
Stop. No!

02:16:30.274 --> 02:16:34.278
It was me. But I swear,
I didn't mean to.

02:16:34.445 --> 02:16:37.948
Riddle made me, and...

02:16:38.449 --> 02:16:41.118
Harry, you're hurt.

02:16:41.451 --> 02:16:42.952
Don't worry.

02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:46.790
Ginny, you need to
get yourself out.

02:16:46.957 --> 02:16:50.209
Follow the Chamber
and you'll find Ron.

02:17:02.347 --> 02:17:04.475
You were brilliant, Fawkes.

02:17:05.601 --> 02:17:08.020
I just wasn't quick enough.

02:17:28.832 --> 02:17:30.541
Of course.

02:17:30.834 --> 02:17:33.670
Phoenix tears have
healing powers.

02:17:35.297 --> 02:17:37.090
Thanks.

02:17:38.842 --> 02:17:40.968
It's all right, Ginny.

02:17:42.094 --> 02:17:44.306
It's over.

02:17:45.307 --> 02:17:47.851
It's just a memory.

02:17:50.728 --> 02:17:56.067
Amazing! This is
just like magic!

02:18:07.370 --> 02:18:10.040
You both realize, of course...

02:18:10.207 --> 02:18:15.712
...that in the past few hours, you have
broken perhaps a dozen school rules.

02:18:16.338 --> 02:18:17.380
Yes, sir.

02:18:17.548 --> 02:18:20.759
There is sufficient evidence
to have you both expelled.

02:18:20.925 --> 02:18:22.136
Yes, sir.

02:18:22.302 --> 02:18:25.055
Therefore, it is only fitting...

02:18:26.598 --> 02:18:28.892
...that you both receive...

02:18:29.393 --> 02:18:33.480
...Special Awards for
Services to the School.

02:18:35.566 --> 02:18:37.401
Thanks, sir.

02:18:37.985 --> 02:18:40.279
Now, Mr. Weasley,
if you would...

02:18:40.446 --> 02:18:44.616
...have an owl deliver these
release papers to Azkaban.

02:18:45.742 --> 02:18:50.496
I believe we want our
gamekeeper back.

02:18:55.460 --> 02:18:59.798
First, I want to
thank you, Harry.

02:19:00.424 --> 02:19:03.927
You must have shown me real
loyalty down in the Chamber.

02:19:04.803 --> 02:19:09.391
Nothing but that could
have called Fawkes to you.

02:19:11.768 --> 02:19:13.312
And...

02:19:13.896 --> 02:19:15.314
...second...

02:19:15.481 --> 02:19:20.277
...I sense that something
is troubling you.

02:19:20.486 --> 02:19:22.987
Am I right, Harry?

02:19:24.823 --> 02:19:26.575
It's just...

02:19:27.743 --> 02:19:32.456
You see, sir, I couldn't help but
notice certain things, certain...

02:19:32.623 --> 02:19:38.295
Certain similarities
between Tom Riddle and me.

02:19:38.837 --> 02:19:40.047
I see.

02:19:40.214 --> 02:19:46.011
Well, you can speak
Parseltongue, Harry. Why?

02:19:46.469 --> 02:19:51.975
Because Lord Voldemort
can speak Parseltongue.

02:19:53.185 --> 02:19:55.938
If I'm not mistaken, Harry...

02:19:56.313 --> 02:20:00.150
...he transferred some
of his powers to you...

02:20:00.317 --> 02:20:03.278
...the night he
gave you that scar.

02:20:03.445 --> 02:20:07.324
Voldemort transferred
some of his powers to me?

02:20:09.243 --> 02:20:11.954
Not intentionally...

02:20:12.830 --> 02:20:14.748
...but yes.

02:20:16.667 --> 02:20:20.003
So the Sorting Hat was right.
I should be in Slytherin.

02:20:20.170 --> 02:20:25.008
It's true. You possess many of the
qualities that Voldemort himself prizes.

02:20:25.175 --> 02:20:28.011
Determination,
resourcefulness...

02:20:28.178 --> 02:20:32.182
...and if I may say so, a certain
disregard for the rules.

02:20:32.891 --> 02:20:36.895
Why, then, did the Sorting
Hat place you in Gryffindor?

02:20:37.729 --> 02:20:41.400
- Because I asked it to.
- Exactly, Harry. Exactly.

02:20:41.567 --> 02:20:43.652
Which makes you different
from Voldemort.

02:20:43.819 --> 02:20:47.698
It is not our abilities that
show what we truly are.

02:20:47.990 --> 02:20:50.117
It is our choices.

02:20:53.787 --> 02:20:57.207
If you want proof why you
belong in Gryffindor...

02:20:57.374 --> 02:21:02.254
...then I suggest you look
more closely at this.

02:21:03.255 --> 02:21:04.923
Be careful.

02:21:10.596 --> 02:21:13.265
Godric Gryffindor.

02:21:13.432 --> 02:21:17.519
It would take a true Gryffindor
to pull that out of the hat.

02:21:26.403 --> 02:21:27.780
Dobby.

02:21:29.072 --> 02:21:33.452
So this is your master. The
family you serve is the Malfoys.

02:21:35.621 --> 02:21:38.957
I'll deal with you later.

02:21:44.797 --> 02:21:46.423
Out of my way, Potter.

02:21:46.590 --> 02:21:50.177
So it's true. You have returned.

02:21:50.844 --> 02:21:53.639
When the governors learned that
Arthur Weasley's daughter...

02:21:53.806 --> 02:21:57.976
...was taken into the Chamber,
they saw fit to summon me back.

02:21:58.811 --> 02:22:02.898
- Ridiculous. - Curiously,
Lucius, several of them...

02:22:03.065 --> 02:22:06.735
...were under the impression that
you would curse their family...

02:22:06.902 --> 02:22:09.738
...if they did not agree to
suspend me in the first place.

02:22:10.197 --> 02:22:13.659
- How dare you!
- Beg your pardon?

02:22:13.826 --> 02:22:17.621
My sole concern has always
been and will always be...

02:22:17.788 --> 02:22:20.624
...the welfare of this school...

02:22:20.791 --> 02:22:25.087
...and, of course, its students.

02:22:29.133 --> 02:22:33.345
The culprit has been
identified, I presume?

02:22:33.720 --> 02:22:35.264
Yes.

02:22:36.849 --> 02:22:38.684
And?

02:22:39.852 --> 02:22:41.895
Who was it?

02:22:48.318 --> 02:22:50.863
Voldemort.

02:22:52.030 --> 02:22:57.494
Only this time he chose to
act through somebody else...

02:22:58.036 --> 02:23:01.665
...by means of this.

02:23:04.334 --> 02:23:05.878
I see.

02:23:07.337 --> 02:23:11.550
Fortunately, our young
Mr. Potter discovered it.

02:23:11.884 --> 02:23:15.554
One hopes that no more of Lord
Voldemort's old school-things...

02:23:15.721 --> 02:23:18.974
...should find their way
into innocent hands.

02:23:19.308 --> 02:23:23.228
The consequences for the one
responsible would be...

02:23:23.604 --> 02:23:25.481
...severe.

02:23:26.899 --> 02:23:29.693
Well, let us hope...

02:23:29.860 --> 02:23:35.407
...that Mr. Potter will always
be around to save the day.

02:23:36.158 --> 02:23:39.912
Don't worry. I will be.

02:23:48.670 --> 02:23:50.714
Dumbledore.

02:23:51.840 --> 02:23:55.385
Come, Dobby. We're leaving.

02:24:12.653 --> 02:24:17.116
Sir? I wonder if I
could have that?

02:24:23.539 --> 02:24:25.124
Mr. Malfoy.

02:24:25.290 --> 02:24:27.501
Mr. Malfoy!

02:24:27.960 --> 02:24:30.129
I have something of yours.

02:24:31.797 --> 02:24:34.758
Mine? I don't know what
you're talking about.

02:24:34.925 --> 02:24:36.468
I think you do, sir.

02:24:36.635 --> 02:24:39.763
I think you slipped the diary
into Ginny Weasley's cauldron...

02:24:39.930 --> 02:24:41.348
...that day at Diagon Alley.

02:24:42.057 --> 02:24:44.601
You do, do you?

02:24:51.942 --> 02:24:55.028
Why don't you prove it?

02:25:01.285 --> 02:25:03.454
Come, Dobby.

02:25:04.746 --> 02:25:06.790
Open it.

02:25:10.294 --> 02:25:11.837
Dobby.

02:25:12.004 --> 02:25:15.174
Master has given Dobby a sock.

02:25:15.466 --> 02:25:17.551
What? I didn't give...

02:25:17.718 --> 02:25:21.430
Master has presented
Dobby with clothes.

02:25:21.597 --> 02:25:24.641
Dobby is free.

02:25:31.190 --> 02:25:34.943
You lost me my servant!

02:25:41.909 --> 02:25:45.913
You shall not harm Harry Potter.

02:25:58.050 --> 02:26:01.762
Your parents were
meddlesome fools too.

02:26:01.929 --> 02:26:05.098
Mark my words, Potter.
One day soon...

02:26:05.265 --> 02:26:10.479
...you are going to meet
the same sticky end.

02:26:16.193 --> 02:26:22.074
Harry Potter freed Dobby. How
can Dobby ever repay him?

02:26:22.449 --> 02:26:26.703
- Just promise me something.
- Anything, sir.

02:26:28.664 --> 02:26:31.125
Never try to save my life again.

02:26:37.256 --> 02:26:40.259
- Welcome back, Sir Nicholas.
- Thank you.

02:26:40.551 --> 02:26:42.928
- Good evening, Sir Nicholas.
- Good evening.

02:26:43.095 --> 02:26:46.014
- Good to see you, Sir
Nicholas. - Thank you.

02:26:47.391 --> 02:26:49.601
Hello.

02:26:51.311 --> 02:26:55.941
- Hermione! Welcome back.
- Thanks, Sir Nicholas.

02:26:59.194 --> 02:27:02.531
Harry. It's Hermione.

02:27:29.349 --> 02:27:33.061
- Welcome back, Hermione.
- It's good to be back.

02:27:33.228 --> 02:27:35.814
Congratulations. I can't
believe you solved it.

02:27:35.981 --> 02:27:38.233
We had loads of help from you.

02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:41.612
- We couldn't have done
it without you. - Thanks.

02:27:43.447 --> 02:27:46.408
Could I have your
attention, please?

02:27:50.579 --> 02:27:53.081
Before we begin the feast...

02:27:53.248 --> 02:27:59.005
...let us have a round of applause for
Professor Sprout, Madam Pomfrey...

02:27:59.671 --> 02:28:03.801
...whose Mandrake juice has been
so successfully administered...

02:28:03.967 --> 02:28:06.637
...to all who had
been Petrified.

02:28:17.147 --> 02:28:20.150
Also, in light of the
recent events...

02:28:20.317 --> 02:28:22.486
...as a school treat...

02:28:22.653 --> 02:28:26.615
...all exams have been canceled.

02:28:29.284 --> 02:28:30.869
<i>Oh, no.</i>

02:28:47.803 --> 02:28:49.847
Sorry I'm late.

02:28:55.894 --> 02:29:00.315
The owl that delivered my release
papers got all lost and confused.

02:29:00.649 --> 02:29:03.944
Some ruddy bird called Errol.

02:29:19.710 --> 02:29:24.716
And I'd just like to say that if it
hadn't been for you, Harry and Ron...

02:29:25.924 --> 02:29:28.886
...and Hermione, of course...

02:29:29.553 --> 02:29:33.640
...I would still be
you-know-where...

02:29:33.807 --> 02:29:37.394
...so I'd just like
to say thanks.

02:29:46.779 --> 02:29:49.740
There's no Hogwarts
without you, Hagrid.
