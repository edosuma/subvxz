14:57.814 --> 15:01.235
(SPUTTERING) Saving someone's life.

15:06.031 --> 15:09.493
I've been, uh, following the sun,
and, uh, I mean...

15:10.494 --> 15:11.995
I'm trying to find, uh...

15:13.580 --> 15:17.376
There's, uh... There's this genie,
and he's, uh...

15:17.459 --> 15:19.503
He's in trouble, and, uh...

15:21.421 --> 15:24.091
(EXHALES) At least I thought he was.

15:25.592 --> 15:28.220
Uh, suddenly I can't quite remember.

15:29.221 --> 15:31.890
Then you must stay.

15:41.483 --> 15:43.193
It is quite beautiful here.

15:50.033 --> 15:51.451
Maybe I will stay a while.

15:57.916 --> 15:59.459
SARAH: How long is she planning to stay?

15:59.543 --> 16:00.586
EDWIN: I don't know yet.

16:00.669 --> 16:03.964
-Aren't you concerned about her...
-Let me talk to her. Please.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.386
(DOOR OPENS)

16:11.847 --> 16:13.098
I wish we had a proper bedroom...

16:14.850 --> 16:15.893
Or a change of clothes.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.354
We can get you new things, of course.

16:20.898 --> 16:21.940
What I would like to know...

16:23.692 --> 16:25.903
How long are you planning on staying
this time?

16:26.862 --> 16:27.863
Forever.

16:28.530 --> 16:30.240
There's nothing left for me in Wonderland.

16:33.118 --> 16:34.119
Alice...

16:36.955 --> 16:38.874
There's something you must understand.

16:41.043 --> 16:45.547
I have a new family now,
and they will love you as I do.

16:47.132 --> 16:51.678
But Millie is quite young
and impressionable.

16:53.138 --> 16:54.640
If you truly want to stay,

16:54.723 --> 16:57.434
there can be no more mention of Wonderland

16:58.143 --> 16:59.728
or this genie.

16:59.811 --> 17:02.439
He had a name. Cyrus.

17:02.814 --> 17:05.817
Alice, wherever you really were,

17:07.236 --> 17:12.491
whatever really happened,
these things are best forgotten.

17:12.574 --> 17:14.952
So I should just sweep him under the rug,

17:15.786 --> 17:18.789
like you did with mother and with me?

17:23.418 --> 17:27.422
I spent a long time
clinging to painful memories.

17:29.883 --> 17:34.555
And then one day I realized
I had to stop clinging to be happy.

17:35.389 --> 17:37.432
I don't think I can be happy again.

17:40.227 --> 17:41.728
And not without him.

17:45.148 --> 17:49.403
You will be
if you want to live in this house.

17:51.321 --> 17:57.744
Can you do that? Can you try to fit in,
to be happy in our home?

17:59.329 --> 18:01.790
I have nowhere else to go.

18:04.960 --> 18:06.420
I'll try.

18:06.503 --> 18:09.756
And you will forget about Wonderland
and this Cyrus?

18:13.177 --> 18:14.219
Alice.

18:15.721 --> 18:20.058
Are you glad I'm back, Father?

18:25.814 --> 18:26.899
Do you really want me here?

18:27.733 --> 18:30.986
(SIGHS SOFTLY) Of course I do, Alice.

18:33.572 --> 18:34.656
Of course.

18:39.786 --> 18:42.623
(DISTANT CHITTERING)

18:44.666 --> 18:46.084
Cyrus ran this way.

18:46.168 --> 18:48.754
Jafar's filthy guards,
they all ran after him.

18:48.837 --> 18:51.632
Good. Then they'll have him apprehended
in no time.

18:51.798 --> 18:56.094
That, my little dimwit,
is precisely what we do not want.

18:57.012 --> 18:58.180
I don't understand.

18:58.263 --> 19:00.140
Of course you don't.
You Tweedles never do.

19:00.224 --> 19:01.767
Each one dumber than the next.

19:01.850 --> 19:06.230
But Your Majesty can't go after him alone,
and that outfit is not befitting a queen.

19:06.313 --> 19:08.982
(ANGRILY) Do not tell me
what I can and can't do!

19:09.066 --> 19:12.903
Everyone keeps underestimating me.
I was not always queen.

19:12.986 --> 19:15.656
I know how to get my hands dirty.

19:16.281 --> 19:17.282
Of course.

19:17.407 --> 19:21.078
If I alone capture the genie,
I will have him and his bottle.

19:21.161 --> 19:22.955
I will have everything.

19:23.038 --> 19:27.918
Jafar will have nothing,
and I win the game.

19:32.422 --> 19:33.423
Alice!

19:34.842 --> 19:35.843
Alice!

19:39.012 --> 19:43.350
Alice, are you... Oh! What the hell?

19:43.433 --> 19:46.603
Is this a bloody perfume bottle?
(GROANS)

19:48.146 --> 19:49.147
(GASPS)

19:50.816 --> 19:51.859
You're here!

19:53.735 --> 19:56.196
Found ya. And you're in one piece.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.991
I guess we're both okay.
You had me worried for a bit.

19:59.074 --> 20:03.495
(GASPS) Don't worry about anything.
Everything is wonderful here.

20:03.579 --> 20:06.582
(GASPS) You've got to see this!

20:08.125 --> 20:09.543
-Slow down.
-Come on!

20:16.175 --> 20:19.761
-What the hell is that?
-I made it. Isn't it pretty?

20:21.889 --> 20:23.473
What the bloody hell is going on here?

20:25.434 --> 20:26.727
Who's that?

20:28.896 --> 20:31.273
Oh, that's just the Carpenter.
Don't worry about him.

20:31.356 --> 20:34.985
Right. Don't worry about the man
with the saw and the scary grin.

20:35.068 --> 20:36.612
(CHUCKLES) Exactly.

20:38.238 --> 20:39.281
(GIGGLES)

20:39.448 --> 20:42.409
Um, how long have you been here, Alice?

20:42.492 --> 20:45.162
(GASPS) I don't remember.

20:46.079 --> 20:47.080
A while.

20:51.001 --> 20:52.044
And you took the necklace off

20:52.127 --> 20:54.129
and just stopped everything
to pick flowers

20:54.379 --> 20:55.964
with Cyrus still a prisoner?

20:58.425 --> 20:59.635
Yes?

20:59.718 --> 21:03.764
-Why would you do that?
-Because it makes me happy.

21:09.645 --> 21:11.897
I really am so happy to be back.

21:11.980 --> 21:13.023
(EDWIN CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

21:14.191 --> 21:15.526
Thank you for my new dress.

21:18.487 --> 21:20.447
I really love the smell of those daisies.

21:20.781 --> 21:22.533
They're dahlias, dear.

21:22.616 --> 21:26.537
Dahlias. Of course. I must remember that.

21:28.288 --> 21:30.082
I think you look beautiful
in that dress, Alice.

21:31.250 --> 21:32.459
MARY: Of course she does,

21:32.543 --> 21:35.796
which is why I think we should talk
about her social obligations,

21:36.755 --> 21:39.132
now that she's back from the dead.

21:39.216 --> 21:40.259
Social obligations?

21:40.342 --> 21:42.177
Well, I don't want to put
a fine point on it,

21:42.261 --> 21:45.138
but you're not a little girl anymore.

21:46.265 --> 21:47.432
No, of course not.

21:47.516 --> 21:49.852
And a young woman
should think about her future.

21:49.935 --> 21:52.521
Sarah, please. She's only just returned.

21:52.604 --> 21:54.106
All the more reason we have to help.

21:54.523 --> 21:56.692
Help? With what, exactly?

21:57.609 --> 22:01.363
Meeting a suitable young man, of course.
Moving on with your life.

22:02.447 --> 22:04.741
I've been speaking
with Mrs. Darcy down the road.

22:04.825 --> 22:09.288
Her son is unmarried, employed,
and not awful to look at.

22:09.872 --> 22:11.123
We've arranged for a tea.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.544
I just... I just couldn't.

22:15.919 --> 22:18.505
MARY: I'm afraid you must.
I've already made the arrangements.

22:19.715 --> 22:22.968
It's just tea, Alice.
Surely you can manage that much.

22:23.051 --> 22:25.888
MARY: The Darcy boy will carry on
both halves of the conversation.

22:26.138 --> 22:28.098
All you have to do is smile.

22:29.141 --> 22:32.144
EDWIN: This could be good for you, Alice.
A way to, you know,

22:33.020 --> 22:34.146
forget your troubles.

22:35.731 --> 22:37.232
Alice. What on earth?

22:37.316 --> 22:39.568
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

22:40.903 --> 22:43.405
I'm simply not ready
for meeting any young men right now.

-Yes, sir.

23:29.284 --> 23:30.869
You lot with me. And when you find him,

remember, that bastard killed one of ours.

Have you felt the bark on this tree?
It's lovely.

23:47.719 --> 23:50.514
I don't want to feel the bloody bark.
I want you to snap out of it.

23:50.597 --> 23:51.765
Snap out of what?

23:52.349 --> 23:54.268
-Alice, what's wrong with you?
-Nothing.

23:54.351 --> 23:56.812
For the first time in my life,
nothing's wrong.

I'm happy. He's happy. Why aren't you?

What have you done to Alice?
I said, what did you do to her?

24:11.994 --> 24:14.997
Listen, I'm more of a lover, generally,

24:15.455 --> 24:17.541

Father says you should
never be afraid of your bad dreams.

Because they're not real.

Are your bad dreams real, though?

I thought that hole could never be filled.

I didn't really use it properly.

No. I'm not going anywhere.

29:08.207 --> 29:09.583
I finally found a home.

29:41.365 --> 29:43.951
Now, if I were a frightened little genie,

29:47.287 --> 29:48.413
which way would I run?

29:53.919 --> 29:55.045
(WHOOSHING)

30:14.022 --> 30:15.023
Clever.

30:16.483 --> 30:17.776
But not clever enough.

30:26.201 --> 30:27.578
EDWIN: Ah, there she is.

30:28.161 --> 30:29.913
Looks like she started breakfast
without us.

30:31.665 --> 30:34.585
Alice. This is the boy
I was telling you about,

30:34.668 --> 30:36.044
Mrs. Darcy's son.

30:36.128 --> 30:37.838
EDWIN: He just stopped by.

30:37.921 --> 30:41.675
We thought he could join us for breakfast,
if you were feeling better.

30:41.758 --> 30:44.511
Good morning, Alice. Nice to meet you.

30:47.222 --> 30:48.557
You brought him here?

30:50.851 --> 30:54.188
And you thought what?
That would make things better?

30:54.730 --> 30:55.898
Help me forget?

30:57.232 --> 30:59.401
You really don't know me at all.

(DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)

31:09.912 --> 31:12.372
-Where are you going?
-Anywhere else.

31:12.456 --> 31:15.751
But you have nowhere else to go.
Isn't that what you said?

31:21.507 --> 31:23.717
Go back in and apologize.

31:23.800 --> 31:24.927
I won't.

31:25.010 --> 31:27.846
Just because you married someone
you don't love doesn't mean I have to.

31:27.930 --> 31:29.139
What are you talking about?

31:29.223 --> 31:31.808
-She doesn't make you truly happy.
-Of course she does.

31:31.892 --> 31:32.935
Not like Mother.

31:39.149 --> 31:44.196
We can't spend our whole life
in mourning, Alice.

31:44.821 --> 31:48.408
You must find a way to move forward
as I did.

31:49.326 --> 31:52.162
It took you years to get over Mother.

31:53.830 --> 31:55.999
You were sad my entire childhood.

31:56.875 --> 31:59.670
Why do you think I can forget Cyrus
in just a few days?

31:59.753 --> 32:02.631
Because, unlike him,
your mother was bloody real!

32:03.257 --> 32:05.592
-Cyrus was real.
-No, he's not!

32:05.676 --> 32:08.512
You need to find a way to give up
this imaginary love story, Alice,

32:08.595 --> 32:10.597
and move on with your life.

32:10.681 --> 32:12.099
What if it's not possible?

32:12.182 --> 32:15.811
What if a person can't forget their love,
no matter how much easier it would be?

32:15.894 --> 32:18.313
-You must.
-I can't.

32:19.940 --> 32:23.861
Then you can no longer live under our roof
with our family.

32:25.904 --> 32:27.990
Is that you talking, or her?

32:30.659 --> 32:33.704
There's one other good option.

32:35.372 --> 32:38.083
A doctor in London. Lydgate.

32:38.625 --> 32:41.670
-He runs a psychiatric hospital.
-A madhouse?

32:41.753 --> 32:44.923
It's not like it is in the books.
This place is very nice, very modern.

32:45.007 --> 32:48.844
But I'm not mad!
Why can't you just believe...

32:48.927 --> 32:50.637
And what part do you want me to believe?

32:50.929 --> 32:52.806
The genie or the talking rabbit?

32:52.890 --> 32:53.891
Me.

32:55.058 --> 32:56.602
You should believe in me!

32:58.187 --> 33:00.272
-I'm sorry.
-(SIGHS)

33:00.814 --> 33:04.151
We can't go on like this.
I have to think of Millie.

33:05.110 --> 33:07.154
You'll just send me to a madhouse.

33:07.237 --> 33:08.614
Not send you.

33:09.698 --> 33:10.866
Offer you a choice.

33:11.658 --> 33:14.536
You can let Sarah find you a husband,
or you can live in a hospital,

33:15.162 --> 33:19.583
but you can't sit here
pining for a make-believe life, Alice.

33:22.252 --> 33:25.297
The choice, Alice, is entirely yours.

33:33.388 --> 33:36.850
We're running out of time, Alice.
You have to make a choice.

33:38.143 --> 33:39.937
Don't come any closer.

33:40.020 --> 33:42.064
This place can only make you stay
if you want to.

33:44.107 --> 33:46.693
So I'm gonna help you remember,
even if it kills me.

33:48.695 --> 33:51.990
You know who gave you this?
His name was Cyrus.

33:53.617 --> 33:56.370
And you've been fighting like hell
to get to him.

You can kill me, become a bloody tree,
stay here forever,

-We both know she couldn't stay here.

36:04.081 --> 36:06.291
She's going to be much happier.

36:06.959 --> 36:09.044
So you think she made the right decision?

36:09.211 --> 36:12.673
I know she did.
I was actually surprised at her wisdom.

36:16.718 --> 36:18.220
It's going to be fine.
