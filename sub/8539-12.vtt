HOW DID HE DIE?THERE WERE INDICATIONS
AROUND THE BODY

06:09.238 --> 06:11.283
OF SOME KIND OF
BLACK MAGIC RITUAL.

BUT SHE ACTUALLY CALLED

06:54.022 --> 06:55.545

06:55.632 --> 06:57.155
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN WORRISOME.

IT WAS KIND OF FUNNY.

AND FIVE BLOWN ROUTES--

AND LET HIS TEAM DOWN.

HOW IT'S BETWEEN
A COACH AND HIS TEAM.

AN ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT.

MADE AN ISSUE OF IT.THAT'S OKAY THEN?

HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT?

13:21.104 --> 13:24.760

13:56.357 --> 14:00.752
I KNEW THE EARTH

YOU CAN'T HELP HIM.IT'S TRUE. WE CAN'T,

14:03.581 --> 14:07.063
BUT WHAT WE CANDO IS FIND
AND PUNISH THE PEOPLE
WHO MURDERED HIM.

14:07.150 --> 14:08.673
THERE'S NO NEED.

14:08.760 --> 14:12.155
CODY DESERVED TO DIE.
HE WAS A BAD PERSON.

14:12.242 --> 14:16.507
HE STOLE AND TORTURED
AND KILLED MY CAT.

14:16.594 --> 14:19.032
I SAW HIM TAKE IT.WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

14:19.119 --> 14:21.164
FEAR, I GUESS.

14:21.251 --> 14:23.471
THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS
WITH THE COWEN.

14:23.558 --> 14:27.562
THEY LIVE IN FEAR.THE COWEN?

14:27.649 --> 14:31.131
THOSE WHO ARE NOT WICCA.
THOSE WHO UNBELIEVE OUR POWERS.

14:31.218 --> 14:33.133
WHAT POWERS ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, EXACTLY?

14:33.220 --> 14:37.137
A WITCH IS SIMPLY
A HIGH PRIESTESS OF THE WICCA.

14:37.224 --> 14:39.922
WE WORSHIP THE HORNED GOD
AND THE TRIPLE GODDESS.

14:40.009 --> 14:43.230
WE'RE HEALERS MOSTLY,
BUT WE HAVE THE MAGIC ALSO,

14:43.317 --> 14:46.059
WHEN NEEDED--
SPELLS AND SO FORTH.

14:46.146 --> 14:49.758
DID YOU PUT A SPELL
ON CODY ELKINS?I DID.

14:49.845 --> 14:52.195
I PUT A KILLING SPELL ON HIM.MM.

14:52.282 --> 14:54.415
I'D DONE THE SPELL
SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE,

14:54.502 --> 14:57.766
BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
IT'S WORKED.

14:57.853 --> 15:00.638
WHAT DOES
THE SPELLING INVOLVE?

15:00.725 --> 15:02.118
WHAT DO YOU DO, EXACTLY?

15:06.296 --> 15:09.517
WHY AM I HERE?EXPLAIN TO US
WHY FORENSICS TELLS US

15:09.604 --> 15:13.173
THAT YOUR BLOOD WAS FOUND
ALL OVER A T-SHIRT
WE FOUND IN CODY'S LOCKER.

15:13.260 --> 15:15.175
I TOLD YOU,
WE HAD AN ARGUMENT.

15:15.262 --> 15:19.179
OH, SO NOW YOU'RE SAYING
YOU HAD AN ACTUAL FISTFIGHT?
YOU DREW BLOOD?

15:19.266 --> 15:21.790
YEAH.
IT WAS NO BIG DEAL.
I CHEWED HIM OUT.

15:21.877 --> 15:24.184
HE GOT MAD, AND
TOOK A COUPLE OF SWINGS.

15:24.271 --> 15:27.187
LAID OUT BY A KID, HUH?IT WAS A LUCKY PUNCH.

15:27.274 --> 15:31.147
YOUR OWN STUDENT BEATS YOU
AND YOU DON'T TELL ANYONE?IT WAS NO BIG DEAL.

15:31.234 --> 15:34.846
OR YOU FIGURED YOU'LL GET EVEN
WITH HIM TOMORROW
SO BEST KEEP IT QUIET?

15:34.934 --> 15:39.155
NO. NO.
I WAS TOO EMBARRASSED.

15:39.242 --> 15:41.810
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THE KID
IS A FREAKING NUT BAG.

15:41.897 --> 15:43.333
MAKES ME LOOK BAD
EITHER WAY,

15:43.420 --> 15:45.509
SO I JUST PRETENDED
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

15:45.596 --> 15:48.730
HE HIT YOU FIRST--
HIS OWN COACH?

15:48.817 --> 15:50.123
I TOLD YOU--A NUT BAG.

15:50.210 --> 15:51.820
WELL, THAT'S NOT
WHAT WE'VE HEARD.

15:51.907 --> 15:54.736
ASK DANIEL BROWN.
HE'S A GOOD FRIEND OF CODY'S.

15:54.823 --> 15:58.044
LAST MONTH CODY GOT MAD
OVER A CARD GAME OR SOMETHING.

15:58.131 --> 16:00.655
BEAT DANNO UNCONSCIOUS.
HAD TO BE DRAGGED OFF OF HIM.

16:00.742 --> 16:02.439
DON'T KNOW WHY DANNO
DIDN'T PRESS CHARGES.

16:02.526 --> 16:04.572
DANIEL BROWN?YEAH.

16:11.709 --> 16:13.146
KILLING SPELLS ARE SECRET,

16:13.233 --> 16:15.887
BUT THIS IS
A PUBLIC BINDING SPELL

16:15.975 --> 16:18.455
THAT I CANSHOW YOU,
AND IT'S SIMILAR.

16:18.542 --> 16:20.501
WHAT IS YOUR NAME?WHAT'S IT TO YOU?

16:20.588 --> 16:21.763
KIMBALL CHO.HEY.

16:24.548 --> 16:26.463
GOD AND GODDESS, HEAR ME.

16:26.550 --> 16:29.249
BY LIGHT OF THE ONE FLAME,
LET THIS MORTAL SOUL,

16:29.336 --> 16:32.904
KIMBALL CHO,
BE BOUND BY MY POWER.

16:32.992 --> 16:36.212
SO THAT HE KNOWS I SPEAK TRUTH,
LET HIM BEHOLD

16:36.299 --> 16:40.042
THE KING OF BEASTS
AND KNEEL BEFORE HIM.

16:40.129 --> 16:41.391
COME ON.

16:47.093 --> 16:49.486
[speaking Latin]

16:58.365 --> 17:00.584
THAT'S IT?
THAT'S YOUR SPELL?

17:00.671 --> 17:03.805
YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE HIM DRINK
A POTION OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

17:03.892 --> 17:05.589
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE MUCH,
DOES IT?

17:05.676 --> 17:08.636
BUT IT'S VERY POWERFUL MAGIC.YEAH, OKAY.

17:08.723 --> 17:10.855
UNFORTUNATELY IT SEEMS
THAT ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS

17:10.942 --> 17:14.207
HELPED YOUR MAGIC ALONG
WITH A BLUNT INSTRUMENT.

17:14.294 --> 17:17.079
IN WHICH CASE,
YOU'RE AS UNMAGICALLY GUILTY
AS THEY ARE.

17:17.166 --> 17:19.386
IF A FRIEND OF MINE
HAD DONE THIS,

17:19.473 --> 17:23.172
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE POINTED
THE POLICE RIGHT TO ME
WITH A PENTACLE AND FLAME.

17:23.259 --> 17:26.697
NO, CODY'S MURDER WAS STAGED
TO LOOK LIKE WICCA.

17:26.784 --> 17:29.744
ANY FOOL IN THIS TOWN
WOULD THINK OF IT.
IT'S OBVIOUS MISDIRECTION.

17:29.831 --> 17:32.138
THERE'S A WITCH IN TOWN. DUH.

17:32.225 --> 17:36.881
A WITCH THAT PUT A KILLING SPELL
ON THE BOY IN QUESTION.EXACTLY. IT'S PERFECT.

17:36.968 --> 17:38.579
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

17:40.711 --> 17:41.886
[Patrick] THANK YOU.

17:45.281 --> 17:48.110
CHO?
KIMBALL CHO, LET'S GO.

18:00.775 --> 18:03.473
DIDN'T WANNA BRING HER IN?YOU DON'T THINK
SHE DID THIS?

18:03.560 --> 18:05.519
I DON'T KNOW.
SHE'S DEEP IN IT SOMEHOW--

18:05.606 --> 18:07.477
HIDING SOMETHING OR SOMEONE.

18:07.564 --> 18:10.306
I AGREE. I'D BRING HER IN,
BUT ON WHAT CHARGES?

18:10.393 --> 18:12.787
SHE'S A WHACK JOB.
SHE ENJOYS THE ATTENTION.

18:12.874 --> 18:15.094
QUICKER AND MORE EFFECTIVE
TO JUST IGNORE HER

18:15.181 --> 18:18.662
AND LET HER COME TO US.THAT'S VERY ASTUTE PSYCHOLOGY,
LISBON. I'M IMPRESSED.

18:18.749 --> 18:23.798
[scoffs]WHY'D YOU GIVE HER MY NAME?
SHE SAID I WAS GONNA KNEEL

18:23.885 --> 18:26.931
BEFORE THE LORD OF BEASTS.
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

18:27.018 --> 18:31.153
WHAT? OH, COME ON.
YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME YOU
BELIEVE SHE'S AN ACTUAL WITCH.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.721
NO, OF COURSE NOT. BUT
IF DARK FORCES DID EXIST,

18:33.808 --> 18:36.767
IT REASONS THERE'D BE
PEOPLE WHO CONTROL THEM
FOR THEIR OWN ENDS.

18:36.854 --> 18:38.421
THEY'RE CALLED
INVESTMENT BANKERS.

18:38.508 --> 18:41.250
THEY DON'T LIVE AROUND HERE,
I ASSURE YOU. RELAX.

18:41.337 --> 18:42.512
NO SUCH THING AS WITCHES.

18:44.558 --> 18:46.560
YEAH, THAT'S EASY
FOR YOU TO SAY.

18:46.647 --> 18:48.605
WEIRD WITCH LADY
DIDN'T BURN YOU IN EFFIGY

18:48.692 --> 18:50.216
AND BIND YOU TO HER POWER.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.139
[school bell rings]

19:02.706 --> 19:05.579
"KIMBALL," SHE SAYS,
"YOU SHALL KNEEL BEFORE
THE LORD OF BEASTS."

19:05.666 --> 19:07.711
HUH. THAT'S SCARY.YEAH.

19:07.798 --> 19:11.062
YEAH, IF YOU'RE A 12-YEAR-OLD
GIRL AT HER FIRST SLEEPAWAY
CAMP.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.413
YOU HAD TO BE THERE.DON'T SWEAT IT, MAN.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.937
MET THIS GIRL IN COLLEGE.
SAID SHE WAS A WITCH.

19:16.024 --> 19:18.461
IT'S NOT A SATANIC CULT.
THEY'RE JUST NERDS IN CLOAKS.

19:20.811 --> 19:22.073
HEY, THERE HE IS.

19:25.120 --> 19:26.513
DANIEL BROWN?

19:26.600 --> 19:28.384
WE'VE GOT SOME QUESTIONS
ABOUT CODY ELKINS.

19:30.125 --> 19:31.257
[horn honks]

19:33.868 --> 19:35.870
[tires screech, horn honks]

19:35.957 --> 19:37.176
[grunts]

19:37.263 --> 19:38.873
[Daniel] NO! LET ME GO!

19:42.703 --> 19:44.661
HELLO TO BEAST.

19:44.748 --> 19:47.490
[Daniel] LET ME GO![Rigsby] COME ON.

19:47.577 --> 19:49.144
[grunting]

19:49.231 --> 19:50.624
THE SPELL WAS REAL.

19:53.627 --> 19:55.498
LET'S GO. COME ON.

20:01.069 --> 20:03.593
TELL US ABOUT YOUR FIGHT
WITH CODY ELKINS.

20:03.680 --> 20:04.942
WHAT FIGHT?

20:05.029 --> 20:06.509
THERE WAS NO FIGHT.

20:06.596 --> 20:08.946
NO? HE BEAT YOU UNCONSCIOUS
IS WHAT WE HEARD.

20:09.033 --> 20:11.427
PUT YOU IN THE HOSPITAL.
WE HAVE WITNESSES.

20:11.514 --> 20:14.735
WHO?
NAH, IT WASN'T THAT BAD.

20:14.822 --> 20:17.520
PUT YOU IN THE HOSPITAL?YEAH, FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS.

20:17.607 --> 20:18.826
IT WAS OBSERVATION.

20:21.524 --> 20:23.134
SO WHY DIDN'T YOU
PRESS CHARGES?

20:23.222 --> 20:25.441
IT WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING
BETWEEN FRIENDS.

20:25.528 --> 20:27.443
IT'S NOBODY'S FAULT.

20:27.530 --> 20:30.359
[singsong voice]
OH, I WANNA GET IN THERE.

20:30.446 --> 20:32.100
GO IN THERE.

20:32.187 --> 20:34.145
[normal voice]
JUST... I'M JUST...

20:34.233 --> 20:37.671
OR PERHAPS YOU FIGURED TO
TAKE REVENGE MORE... DIRECTLY?

20:37.758 --> 20:39.977
NAH.

20:40.064 --> 20:42.980
HOW DID THE FIGHT START,
DANIEL?

20:43.067 --> 20:47.246
OVER AT ROY T.'s PLACE
PLAYING CARDS, DRINKIN'.

20:47.333 --> 20:48.725
HIS MOM'S IN REHAB.

20:48.812 --> 20:50.771
SO HE'S GOT THE RUN
OF THE PLACE.

20:50.858 --> 20:52.947
I DID SOME TRASH-TALKIN'.
CODY GOT MAD.

20:54.905 --> 20:57.256
WE FOUGHT. HE WON.

20:57.343 --> 20:58.735
THAT'S ALL.I'M GOING IN.

21:00.346 --> 21:03.218
RIGSBY, UH, YOU--
DO YOU MIND IF I...

21:03.305 --> 21:05.264
NO, DO YOUR THING, MAN.THANKS.

21:08.919 --> 21:10.965
HI. I'M PATRICK.

21:11.052 --> 21:12.096
YOU MUST BE...DANIEL.

21:12.183 --> 21:13.576
ALRIGHT, DANIEL?YEAH?

21:13.663 --> 21:17.276
CAN I KEEP YOUR HAND? THANKS.
NOTHING STRANGE.

21:17.363 --> 21:20.540
I WANT YOU TO BREATHE...
[exhales]

21:20.627 --> 21:22.019
AND LOOK RIGHT HERE.

21:23.891 --> 21:26.502
WHAT DID YOU SAY
THAT ANGERED CODY?

21:26.589 --> 21:30.463
IT WAS A CARD GAME.
A LOT OF TRASH-TALKING.

21:30.550 --> 21:32.465
SO I WAS TRIPPING
ON HIS FAMILY LIKE,

21:32.552 --> 21:35.990
"YOUR MOM'S A HO.
DAD'S A PUNK BITCH."

21:36.077 --> 21:39.559
KEEP IT OVER HERE.
JUST RELAX AND KEEP IT
RIGHT UP IN HERE.

21:39.646 --> 21:41.865
ALRIGHT, I'M LOOKIN'
AT YOU, MAN.GOOD.

21:41.952 --> 21:45.347
ANYWAY, CODY GOES OFF.

21:45.434 --> 21:48.219
BAM. SMASHES A BEER BOTTLE
OVER MY HEAD.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.134
NO WARNING.

21:50.221 --> 21:51.919
I MEAN, I'M OUT COLD,
BUT...

21:52.006 --> 21:55.009
BUT THE GUYS TELL ME HE TRIED
TO SERIOUSLY STOMP ME OUT.

21:55.096 --> 21:58.926
AND IF THEY HADN'T GRABBED HIM,
I COULD BE DEAD.

21:59.013 --> 22:01.450
HOW MUCH DID THE ELKINS
PAY YOU FOR YOUR SILENCE?

22:06.237 --> 22:08.109
NOTHING.WANNA TRY THAT AGAIN?

22:16.770 --> 22:18.119
$1,000.

22:24.647 --> 22:27.868
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT IT'S UNCANNY.
THE LORD OF BEASTS?COINCIDENCE.

22:27.955 --> 22:30.566
PLEASE.
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES?MILLION TO ONE.

22:30.653 --> 22:33.003
THERE YOU GO.LIFE IS A MILLION TO ONE.

22:33.090 --> 22:35.354
THE UNIVERSE
IS ONE BIG COINCIDENCE.

22:35.441 --> 22:37.704
COSMICALLY IMPROBABLE
COINCIDENCES--
THEY HAPPEN ALL THE TIME.

22:37.791 --> 22:40.228
WE JUST DON'T NOTICE 'EM.OR SHE'S A WITCH.

22:40.315 --> 22:42.012
[rings doorbell]OR SHE'S A WITCH.

22:45.233 --> 22:48.018
IS SHE IN CUSTODY--
THE WITCH?

22:48.105 --> 22:49.977
NO, SIR.WHY NOT?

22:50.064 --> 22:53.546
SHE DID PUT A SPELL ON YOUR SON,
LIKE YOU SAID. YOU'RE RIGHT.

22:53.633 --> 22:56.462
BUT THAT DOESN'T CONSTITUTE
A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.

22:56.549 --> 22:59.639
THAT'S PROTECTED FREE SPEECH.SO WHY ARE YOU HERE?

22:59.726 --> 23:03.817
CODY HAD SOME VIOLENCE ISSUES
THAT WE NEED TO SPEAK ABOUT.NO.

23:03.904 --> 23:06.863
HE WAS A GOOD BOY.OH, WE'RE NOT
SAYING OTHERWISE, MA'AM.

23:06.950 --> 23:09.605
BUT IF HE HAD PROBLEMS
WITH HIS TEMPER,
THAT MIGHT HELP

23:09.692 --> 23:12.086
EXPLAIN THE CONTEXT
LEADING TO HIS DEATH.

23:12.173 --> 23:16.569
CONTEXT? IN A PIG'S EAR.
YOU'RE TRYING TO BLAME CODY
FOR HIS OWN DEATH.

23:16.656 --> 23:20.703
I HAVE A QUESTION.
IT'S ALWAYS BOTHERED ME.
WHY DO THEY CALL IT FOOTBALL?

23:20.790 --> 23:23.837
PEOPLE DON'T REALLY USE
THEIR FEET MUCH, DO THEY?

23:23.924 --> 23:26.970
ARE YOU TRYING TO BE RUDE
OR DISRESPECTFUL OR WHAT?

23:27.057 --> 23:29.364
COULD I USE YOUR BATHROOM,
PLEASE?

23:29.451 --> 23:31.627
DOWN THE HALL TO YOUR LEFT.THANKS.

23:34.238 --> 23:36.458
WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM?SORRY ABOUT THAT.

23:36.545 --> 23:38.765
DO YOU KNOW A BOY
NAMED DANIEL BROWN?NO.

23:41.071 --> 23:42.333
MICHAEL...

23:46.033 --> 23:48.122
FINE.

23:48.209 --> 23:50.820
I SEE WHERE THIS IS GOING.

23:50.907 --> 23:52.431
DANIEL AND CODY HAD A FIGHT.

24:04.791 --> 24:06.880
THERE YOU ARE.

24:06.967 --> 24:08.185
GO AWAY.

24:08.272 --> 24:10.884
I CAN'T.
I WISH I COULD.

24:10.971 --> 24:13.800
IT'S MY JOB TO HOUND PEOPLE
UNTIL I GET THE TRUTH.

24:13.887 --> 24:15.671
YEAH, WELL,
UH, GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

24:17.412 --> 24:18.413
[sighs]

24:22.286 --> 24:23.505
NICE PLACE.

24:25.159 --> 24:28.292
MUST BE TOUGH BEING
CODY ELKINS' LITTLE BROTHER.

24:28.379 --> 24:29.468
NO.

24:32.166 --> 24:34.821
WELL... SOMETIMES.

24:34.908 --> 24:36.605
ME? I'D HATE IT.

24:36.692 --> 24:39.478
HE GETS ALL THE ATTENTION,
THE GLORY,

24:39.565 --> 24:41.044
THE GIRLS FLOCKING AROUND--
FOR WHAT?

24:41.131 --> 24:43.830
FOR RUNNING AND JUMPING
AND CATCHING A-A THING?

24:43.917 --> 24:46.180
YEAH,
MONKEYS COULD DO THAT.YEAH.

24:46.267 --> 24:48.269
MONKEYS COULD DO IT BETTER.YEAH, YOU KNOW,

24:48.356 --> 24:50.706
IF MONKEYS PLAYED FOOTBALL,

24:50.793 --> 24:52.752
THEY WOULD KICK
SOME SERIOUS JOCK BUTT.

24:55.232 --> 24:57.234
[both chuckle]

24:58.540 --> 25:00.629
ALRIGHT, I ADMIT IT.

25:00.716 --> 25:04.241
I GAVE DANIEL BROWN MONEY
TO, UH, TO KEEP HIM QUIET.

25:04.328 --> 25:06.983
CODY HAS A...

25:07.070 --> 25:10.509
HAD...A REAL SHOT
AT A COLLEGE CAREER.

25:10.596 --> 25:13.947
WOULD HAVE BEEN THE FIRST ELKINS
TO HAVE THAT CHANCE,

25:14.034 --> 25:15.426
AND WE WERE SO PROUD.

25:18.299 --> 25:22.521
BUT YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND.
A COACH HEARS ABOUT
THESE KINDS OF RUN-INS, AND...

25:22.608 --> 25:25.611
IT WOULD HAVE
RUINED HIS CHANCES
AT ONE OF THE TOP SCHOOLS.

25:25.698 --> 25:28.004
HAD THESE RUN-INS
EVER HAPPENED BEFORE?NO.

25:28.091 --> 25:31.007
NO, OUR SON HAD
NO PROBLEM WITH VIOLENCE.

25:31.094 --> 25:32.487
IT WAS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT.

25:35.403 --> 25:36.622
WHERE'S YOUR FRIEND?

25:39.189 --> 25:40.147
I DON'T KNOW.

25:41.757 --> 25:45.456
HOW COME CODY
KILLED TAMZIN DOVE'S CAT?

25:45.544 --> 25:47.981
I-I DON'T KNOW
THAT HE DID THAT.

25:48.068 --> 25:50.374
SHE SAW HIM TAKE IT.

25:50.461 --> 25:53.464
WELL, LOOK, SHE--SHE SAW
WHAT SHE SAW, RIGHT?

25:53.552 --> 25:55.118
ALRIGHT? I-I-I DON'T KNOW.

25:59.688 --> 26:01.951
UM, IF--IF HE DID DO IT...

26:04.214 --> 26:05.607
YOU KNOW, K-KILL THE CAT...

26:08.131 --> 26:10.438
DO YOU THINK
HE DESERVED TO DIE?

26:10.525 --> 26:12.309
DO YOU?I'M ASKING YOU.

26:16.009 --> 26:18.533
HEY.HEY.

26:18.620 --> 26:21.275
YOU DON'T SPEAK TO MY SON
WITHOUT MY PERMISSION.

26:21.362 --> 26:23.843
OH. WELL, THAT'S A LITTLE WEIRD
AND CONTROLLING, BUT OKAY.

26:23.930 --> 26:26.672
DO YOU MIND IF I SPEAK
TO YOUR SON, MR. ELKINS?

26:26.759 --> 26:28.717
YES, I DO MIND.

26:28.804 --> 26:30.327
I ASKED.

26:30.414 --> 26:31.502
SEE YOU AROUND, BRAD.

26:46.822 --> 26:48.607
OH, MY GOD.
WHERE'S MY FOOD?

26:48.694 --> 26:50.347
WHAT IS THIS?

26:50.434 --> 26:54.177
THAT IS HEALTHY
AND NUTRITIOUS SNACKING.I'M GONNA DIE.

26:54.264 --> 26:56.702
[chuckles sarcastically]SERIOUSLY,
I'M ALLERGIC TO CARROTS.

26:56.789 --> 26:59.269
WELL, I'M TIRED OF THE CAR
REEKING LIKE FAST FOOD.

26:59.356 --> 27:02.229
IT'S LIKE WORKING
WITH A CATERPILLAR...
[makes chomping sounds]

27:02.316 --> 27:06.059
I CAN'T EVEN BE IN
THE SAME ROOM AS A CARROT.
I GO INTO ANAPHYLACTIC--

27:06.146 --> 27:08.714
[gags, grunts]

27:08.801 --> 27:11.151
FUNNY.

27:11.238 --> 27:12.631
[sighs] THAT'S ENOUGH.

27:14.328 --> 27:17.026
RIGSBY, COME ON.

27:17.113 --> 27:18.549
IT'S BRAD.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.900
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK.
THERE HE IS. HE'S LEAVING.

27:26.253 --> 27:27.646
[starts engine]

27:30.649 --> 27:32.172
[beep]

27:32.259 --> 27:35.741
UGH! WHY WON'T
THIS DAMN THING LOG IN?

27:35.828 --> 27:37.264
[beep]

27:37.351 --> 27:38.744

27:45.707 --> 27:47.274
LISBON.[Van Pelt] Hey, it's me.

27:47.361 --> 27:49.668
OH, GOOD, VAN PELT.
HOW DO I GET--Wait.

27:49.755 --> 27:52.975
WE JUST FOLLOWED THE KID
TO THE WITCH'S HOUSE.

27:53.062 --> 27:55.935
Is she with him?HE JUST WENT INSIDE.
THEY HUGGED.

27:58.285 --> 27:59.939
BRAD ELKINS
IS AT TAMZIN DOVE'S.

28:00.026 --> 28:02.855
HE HUGGED HER
AND THEN WENT INSIDE.INTERESTING.

28:02.942 --> 28:05.771
THEY SHOULD WAIT
TEN MINUTES, THEN GO IN.

28:05.858 --> 28:07.163
WHY WAIT?

28:07.250 --> 28:09.209
LET THE PLOT DEVELOP.
LET THE FRUIT RIPEN.

28:09.296 --> 28:11.777
LET THE YEAST RISE,
ET CETERA.

28:11.864 --> 28:13.909
WHAT IF HE MEANS TO DO HER HARM?

28:13.996 --> 28:19.001
WELL, IF HE WAS GONNA DO THAT,
HE'D HAVE DONE IT BY NOW.

28:19.088 --> 28:22.526
WAIT TEN MINUTES,
THEN GO IN.OKAY, BOSS.

28:22.613 --> 28:25.834
WELL?WE WAIT TEN MINUTES,
THEN WE GO IN.

28:25.921 --> 28:29.577
AND PERSONALLY, I DON'T CARE
IF WE WAIT ALL NIGHT.
WITCHCRAFT CREEPS ME OUT.

28:29.664 --> 28:32.885
IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME.
NERDS IN CLOAKS.THERE'S MORE TO IT THAN THAT.

28:32.972 --> 28:36.627
AH, IT'S JUST A SILLY
ALTERNATIVE LIFESTYLE,
LIKE "STAR TREK" OR YOGA.

28:36.715 --> 28:37.846
I DO YOGA.

28:39.892 --> 28:41.154
[clears throat]

28:41.241 --> 28:44.200
[all] BY BLOOD,
HAS HE BEEN SULLIED.

28:44.287 --> 28:46.072
BY BLOOD, LET HIM BE CLEANSED.

28:47.726 --> 28:50.250
BY BLOOD, HAS HE BEEN SULLIED.

28:50.337 --> 28:52.339
BY BLOOD, LET HIM BE CLEANSED.

28:54.167 --> 28:56.343
BY BLOOD, HAS HE BEEN SULLIED.

28:56.430 --> 28:58.519
BY BLOOD, LET HIM BE CLEANSED.

29:00.216 --> 29:02.697
BY BLOOD, HAS HE BEEN SULLIED.

29:02.784 --> 29:04.699
BY BLOOD, LET HIM BE CLEANSED.

29:10.444 --> 29:12.838
[speaking Latin]

29:24.501 --> 29:26.721
BY BLOOD, HAS HE BEEN SULLIED.

29:26.808 --> 29:29.550
BY BLOOD, LET HIM BE CLEANSED.

29:29.637 --> 29:31.813
[all] BY BLOOD,

29:31.900 --> 29:34.163
BY BLOOD, LET HIM BE CLEANSED.

HAS HE BEEN SULLIED.

29:45.087 --> 29:47.873
BY BLOOD, LET HIM BE CLEANSED.

29:47.960 --> 29:50.614
BY BLOOD, HAS HE BEEN SULLIED.

29:50.701 --> 29:52.442
BY BLOOD, LET HIM BE CLEANSED.

29:54.009 --> 29:55.315
BY BLOOD, HAS HE BEEN...

29:56.751 --> 29:59.580
BY BLOOD, LET HIM BE CLEANSED.

29:59.667 --> 30:02.322
NOT YOGA. [grunts]

30:02.409 --> 30:04.585
[Rigsby] POLICE, FREEZE!
EVERYBODY STAY WHERE YOU ARE!

30:04.672 --> 30:07.327
STAY WHERE YOU ARE!
DROP THE KNIFE.STAY WHERE YOU ARE!

30:07.414 --> 30:08.937
DROP THE KNIFE.

30:09.024 --> 30:11.244

30:11.331 --> 30:12.680
LET'S GO BACK.WHAT? NO!

30:12.767 --> 30:14.725
WHAT--WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU PEOPLE, HUH?

30:14.813 --> 30:17.293
WHY CAN'T YOU
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE?COME ON, BRAD.

30:17.380 --> 30:20.340
STAY CALM, BRAD. BE PATIENT
WITH THE WAYS OF THE COWEN.

30:20.427 --> 30:21.863
EVERYBODY JUST STAY
WHERE YOU ARE.

30:37.705 --> 30:39.968
"TAMZIN DOVE."

30:40.055 --> 30:42.188
I LIKE IT.

30:42.275 --> 30:46.279
THESE FILES SAY YOUR REAL NAME
IS SARAH JONES FROM NEW JERSEY.

30:46.366 --> 30:48.498
YOUR MOTHER COMMITTED SUICIDE
WHEN YOU WERE 16.

30:48.585 --> 30:51.632
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHO YOUR FATHER IS.
YOU'RE A COLLEGE DROPOUT.

30:51.719 --> 30:54.243
YOU HAVE A HISTORY
OF MILD PSYCHIATRIC PROBLEMS,

30:54.330 --> 30:57.072
AND YOU SERVED SIX MONTHS FOR
SHOPLIFTING A FEW YEARS BACK.

31:02.251 --> 31:04.863
SARAH JONES IS DEAD.

31:04.950 --> 31:07.343
I'M TAMZIN DOVE.
I AM A PRIESTESS OF WICCA.

31:07.430 --> 31:10.346
YOU CAN'T HURT ME.OH, I DON'T WANNA HURT YOU.

31:10.433 --> 31:12.609
I IMAGINE THERE'S BEEN
ENOUGH OF THAT.

31:12.696 --> 31:15.961
I WANNA HELP YOU.
THIS IS A MURDER INVESTIGATION,

31:16.048 --> 31:19.616
SO ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,
YOU'RE LOOKING AT TROUBLE.

31:19.703 --> 31:21.183
THE GODDESS
WILL PROTECT ME.

31:24.056 --> 31:27.842
TAMZIN, THE GODDESS MAY
GIVE YOU SOLACE AND HOPE

31:27.929 --> 31:29.757
AND MEANING IN YOUR LIFE,

31:29.844 --> 31:32.281
BUT SHE CAN'T PROTECT YOU
FROM THOSE POLICE OUT THERE.

31:39.419 --> 31:41.377
BRAD'S BEEN AN APPRENTICE
OF MY COVEN

31:41.464 --> 31:45.164
SINCE LAST AUTUMN EQUINOX.
THERE'S NO CRIME IN THAT.

31:45.251 --> 31:49.168
KIND OF YOUNG TO BE
A WITCH, ISN'T IT?WE'RE ALL BORN WITCH.

31:49.255 --> 31:51.605
WE'RE ALL BORN INTO MAGIC.

31:51.692 --> 31:54.042
IT'S TAKEN FROM US
AS WE GROW UP.

31:54.129 --> 31:55.914
INTERESTING, IF TRUE.

31:58.046 --> 32:01.832
HOW DID BRAD'S PARENTS FEEL
ABOUT THIS NEW DIRECTION
IN HIS LIFE?

32:01.920 --> 32:04.531
BRAD'S PARENTS JUST...

32:04.618 --> 32:06.272
REALLY HATE WITCHES
FOR SOME REASON.

32:06.359 --> 32:09.014
I MEAN, LIKE,
MORE THAN MOST.

32:09.101 --> 32:13.192
ABOUT A MONTH AGO HIS MOM
THREATENED TO KILL ME
IF I SPOKE TO HIM AGAIN.

32:13.279 --> 32:17.022
BUT YOU DID.BRAD CAME TO ME
OF HIS OWN FREE WILL.

32:17.109 --> 32:20.025
HE WAS DRAWN TO WICCA.
I COULDN'T TURN HIM AWAY.

32:20.112 --> 32:23.071
HOW DOES HE FEEL ABOUT THE SPELL
YOU PUT ON HIS BROTHER?

32:23.158 --> 32:26.031
HE'S AT PEACE WITH IT.

32:26.118 --> 32:28.903
THAT'S WHY WE WERE CONDUCTING
THE CLEANSING RITUAL.

32:28.990 --> 32:31.166
BRAD KNOWS THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THE WORLD OF MAGIC

32:31.253 --> 32:33.864
AND THE REAL WORLD.

32:33.952 --> 32:36.476
HE UNDERSTANDS
I DIDN'T KILL HIS BROTHER.

32:36.563 --> 32:39.218
MAYBE BECAUSE IN THE REAL WORLD,
BRAD DID IT.

32:39.305 --> 32:40.741
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

32:40.828 --> 32:43.744
BRAD'S BEEN HOSPITALIZED
TWICE IN THE LAST YEAR.

32:43.831 --> 32:45.789
BOTH TIMES THE ACCIDENT REPORT
LISTS THE CAUSE

32:45.876 --> 32:47.878
AS "ROUGHHOUSING
WITH BROTHER."

32:47.966 --> 32:49.619
THINK MAYBE BRAD
HAD ENOUGH?

32:49.706 --> 32:51.056
EVERYBODY HAS A LIMIT.

32:57.062 --> 32:58.367
[whispers] I HAVE TO GO.

33:02.589 --> 33:04.199
ME?

33:04.286 --> 33:07.637
NO! W-WHY WOULD I KILL
MY OWN BROTHER?

33:07.724 --> 33:09.161
SO HE WOULD
STOP HURTING YOU.

33:09.248 --> 33:11.337
YEAH, BUT HE NEVER HURT ME.
EVER!

33:11.424 --> 33:14.601
HE PUT YOU
IN THE HOSPITAL TWICE.

33:14.688 --> 33:17.734
ACCIDENTS.
THEY--THEY WERE ACCIDENTS. SO?

33:17.821 --> 33:20.346
SO HE DID HURT YOU. IT WAS
JUST--IT WAS ACCIDENTALLY.

33:20.433 --> 33:22.000
YEAH. I-I MEAN NO.

33:24.306 --> 33:26.569
YEAH.

33:26.656 --> 33:29.833
HE HATED THAT YOU WERE FRIENDS
WITH TAMZIN, DIDN'T HE?

33:29.920 --> 33:30.921
YES.

33:33.402 --> 33:34.882
BUT YOU NEVER GAVE HER UP.

33:38.190 --> 33:40.714
WHY?

33:40.801 --> 33:42.150
I FEEL SAFE THERE.

33:45.719 --> 33:47.199
SORRY.
CAN I HAVE A MINUTE?

33:49.244 --> 33:50.289
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

33:58.775 --> 34:02.127
THE PARENTS ARE HERE.
YOU WANT ME TO HOLD 'EM OFF?YEAH.

34:02.214 --> 34:04.694
WAIT. NO.
LET BRAD GO WITH THEM

34:04.781 --> 34:07.741
UNTIL WE GET SOME HARD EVIDENCE
TO BEAR DOWN ON THEM.

34:07.828 --> 34:09.873
YES, BUT LET ME
TALK TO THEM FIRST.

34:24.279 --> 34:26.151
[Teresa]
PLEASE HAVE A SEAT.

34:26.238 --> 34:29.067
[Michael] I DON'T SEE
WHY YOU HAD TO DRAG HIM HERE.

34:29.154 --> 34:32.200
WE'RE SORRY
FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE.

34:32.287 --> 34:33.984
STRANGE THAT
NEITHER OF YOU TOLD US

34:34.072 --> 34:35.638
ABOUT THE CONNECTION
WITH TAMZIN DOVE.

34:38.293 --> 34:40.339
WE WERE... CONFUSED,

34:40.426 --> 34:42.950
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.
WE DON'T UNDERSTAND

34:43.037 --> 34:45.431
BRAD'S OBSESSION
WITH WITCHCRAFT.

34:45.518 --> 34:47.302
WE WANNA UNDERSTAND,
AND WE'RE TRYING,

34:47.389 --> 34:50.392
BUT IT'S... IT'S DISTURBING

34:50.479 --> 34:53.830
AND, UH, A LITTLE EMBARRASSING,
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

34:53.917 --> 34:57.399
WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER, RIGHT?
WE'RE GONNA GET HELP.

34:57.486 --> 34:59.619
NOWADAYS THERE'S, UH, THERAPY

34:59.706 --> 35:01.751
FOR THESE KINDS
OF PROBLEMS, RIGHT?

35:01.838 --> 35:03.013
WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS.

35:04.363 --> 35:06.495
HAVE YOU CHARGED
THAT, UH, WOMAN?

35:06.582 --> 35:07.714
NO.NO?

35:09.368 --> 35:12.588
I MEAN, ISN'T IT OBVIOUS
THAT SHE DID IT--

35:12.675 --> 35:15.939
HER, ONE OF HER WEIRDO FRIENDS?
I MEAN--

35:16.026 --> 35:18.116
SHE'S HELPING US
WITH OUR INQUIRIES.

35:18.203 --> 35:20.640
SHE SWEARS SHE'S INNOCENT,
SO WE'RE HAVING HER

35:20.727 --> 35:23.512
PUT A SPELL OF REVELATION
ON THE MURDER WEAPON.

35:23.599 --> 35:24.861
A SPELL OF REVELATION?

35:26.776 --> 35:28.952
WITCHES HAVE THE POWER
OF TELEKINESIS.

35:29.039 --> 35:31.477
SHE SAYS
THAT SHE HAS A SPELL

35:31.564 --> 35:34.523
WHICH WILL RAISE THE WEAPON FROM
WHEREVER IT'S BEING CONCEALED

35:34.610 --> 35:36.090
AND REVEAL ITSELF TO US.

35:36.177 --> 35:38.092
AND YOU BELIEVE
THIS EVIL CRAP?

35:38.179 --> 35:42.618
WELL, YOU NEVER CAN TELL.
WE'RE GONNA GIVE IT A WHIRL.THAT'S INSANE.

35:42.705 --> 35:46.144
HER LAST SPELL SEEMED
TO WORK PRETTY WELL.

35:46.231 --> 35:48.755
HOW COULD YOU BE SO COLD?

35:48.842 --> 35:49.886
PRACTICE.

35:52.889 --> 35:55.805
I APOLOGIZE.
BRAD IS FREE TO GO.

35:55.892 --> 35:57.155
LET'S GO.COME ON, SON.

35:58.939 --> 36:00.158
SEE YOU, BRAD.

36:08.296 --> 36:10.516
WELL, LOOK AFTER YOURSELF,
AND IF I WERE YOU,

36:10.603 --> 36:13.693
I'D STAY VERY CLEAR
OF BRAD ELKINS FOR A WHILE.

36:13.780 --> 36:16.609
HMM. I'LL DO
AS THE GODDESS TELLS ME.

36:16.696 --> 36:19.655
WHATEVER. OH, LISTEN,
NEXT TIME YOU SPEAK TO HER,

36:19.742 --> 36:23.181
COULD YOU, UH,
PUT A GOOD WORD IN FOR ME?

36:23.268 --> 36:24.617
I WILL.

36:24.704 --> 36:25.792
THANKS.

36:28.186 --> 36:31.667
I THOUGHT YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE HER CAST A SPELL
TO FIND THE MURDER WEAPON.

36:31.754 --> 36:34.235
OH, THE SPELL'S ALREADY CAST.WHEN DID SHE CAST IT?

36:34.322 --> 36:36.019
SHE DIDN'T. I DID.

36:36.106 --> 36:38.021
YOU CAN CAST SPELLS?

36:38.108 --> 36:41.677
CHO, THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS SPELLS.

36:41.764 --> 36:42.852
I KNOW THAT.

36:45.333 --> 36:47.117
HE, UH, REALLY IS
QUITE FREAKED OUT

36:47.205 --> 36:48.858
ABOUT THIS WITCHCRAFT MALARKEY,
ISN'T HE?

36:48.945 --> 36:50.817
UH, YEAH.

36:50.904 --> 36:54.342
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO WORK
A DOUBLE SHIFT
ON THE STAKEOUT TONIGHT.

36:54.429 --> 36:57.650
ARE YOU AT LEAST GONNA
TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON?OH, COME ON.

36:57.737 --> 36:59.391
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON?

36:59.478 --> 37:01.654
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHO DID THIS AND WHY?

37:01.741 --> 37:03.351
NO, BUT YOU'RE
GONNA TELL ME.

37:05.484 --> 37:06.876
HOW ABOUT I SHOW YOU?

37:52.618 --> 37:55.098

THIS IS GOD SPEAKING.

37:55.185 --> 37:59.538

VERY ANGRY.

37:59.625 --> 38:02.758
AND YOU'RE UNDER ARR--THAT'S ENOUGH.

38:02.845 --> 38:04.020

38:10.244 --> 38:11.898

38:11.985 --> 38:14.640
THE MURDER WEAPON REVEALED.

38:14.727 --> 38:17.686
TAMZIN'S SPELLS SEEM TO WORK.

38:17.773 --> 38:21.299
I GUESS SHE REALLY IS A WITCH.I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

38:21.386 --> 38:24.606
I'M SURE FORENSICS WILL CONFIRM
YOUR SON'S BLOOD AND TISSUE

AND YOUR FINGERPRINTS
ON THE OTHER.

38:27.740 --> 38:29.307
I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF THAT.

38:29.394 --> 38:32.397
THEN WHY WERE YOU
TRYING TO HIDE IT?

38:32.484 --> 38:35.269
TALK TO US, MICHAEL.
MAYBE THERE WERE CIRCUMSTANCES.

38:35.356 --> 38:37.053
MAYBE YOU HAD
TO DEFEND YOURSELF.

38:37.140 --> 38:39.099
I DON'T HAVE
TO TELL YOU ANYTHING.

38:39.186 --> 38:42.537
WHAT ABOUT YOUR SONS' TRIPS
TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM--

38:42.624 --> 38:44.234
THEIR BROKEN BONES?

38:44.322 --> 38:47.063
JUST CLUMSY, I GUESS.

38:47.150 --> 38:49.327
MAYBE A LITTLE DENSE AT TIMES.

38:49.414 --> 38:52.286
GOOD THAT THEY HAD YOU
TO KEEP 'EM IN LINE, HUH?

38:52.373 --> 38:56.464
SOME PEOPLE JUST DON'T
UNDERSTAND HOW LUCKY THEY ARE.

38:56.551 --> 38:58.074
THAT'S RIGHT.

38:59.859 --> 39:01.861
I REALIZED IT WAS YOU
WHEN BRAD SAID

39:01.948 --> 39:04.603
HE LIKED GOING TO TAMZIN'S HOUSE
BECAUSE HE FELT SAFE THERE.

39:04.690 --> 39:08.258
SAFE--HE FEELS
SAFER AT A WITCH'S HOUSE

39:08.346 --> 39:09.782
THAN THEY DO AT HOME.

39:12.915 --> 39:15.135
YOU'VE BEEN ABUSING
AND BEATING YOUR WIFE AND SONS

39:15.222 --> 39:17.572
FOR YEARS, HAVEN'T YOU?NO.

39:17.659 --> 39:22.447
MY GUESS? YOU WERE SMACKIN'
BRAD AROUND A LITTLE TOO MUCH.

39:22.534 --> 39:24.318
CODY WANTED
TO PROTECT HIS BROTHER.

39:24.405 --> 39:26.233
WAS THAT IT?NO.

39:26.320 --> 39:28.278
"NO," HE SAYS.

39:28.366 --> 39:31.194
YOUR WIFE AND SON
ARE DOWN THE HALLWAY,

39:31.281 --> 39:32.674
AND THEY SAY NO, TOO.

39:35.242 --> 39:37.679
THEY KNOW WE CAUGHT HIM
THROWING AWAY THE MURDER WEAPON,

39:37.766 --> 39:41.248
AND THEY STILL DON'T BELIEVE
HE KILLED CODY.

39:41.335 --> 39:44.033
IMAGINE HOW MUCH
THEY LOVE THIS MAN

39:44.120 --> 39:46.949
TO BE IN SUCH DENIAL.

39:47.036 --> 39:49.343
CODY CONFRONTED YOU,
DIDN'T HE?

39:49.430 --> 39:51.780
HE WOULDN'T PUT UP
WITH YOUR CRAP ANYMORE...

39:51.867 --> 39:53.913
SON OF A BITCH!

39:55.088 --> 39:58.439

39:58.526 --> 40:00.441
BUT YOU WOULDN'T HEAR OF IT.

40:04.489 --> 40:05.794
AAH!

40:10.233 --> 40:12.279
HE HIT ME.

40:12.366 --> 40:14.063
I WAS DEFENDING MYSELF.

40:19.939 --> 40:21.157
GOOD-BYE, MICHAEL.

[sobbing]

41:06.333 --> 41:08.422
MORNING.

41:08.509 --> 41:11.381

IN A SAFE PLACE.
