02:38.416 --> 02:42.416
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO
FOR OUR VACATION?

02:42.416 --> 02:45.416
ANYTHING BUT TREASURE
HUNTIN', LOUIE.

02:45.416 --> 02:50.083

03:13.166 --> 03:16.124
I'VE LOOKED
EVERYWHERE ELSE.

03:16.124 --> 03:17.749
LOOK! I FOUND IT!

03:17.749 --> 03:21.000
THE THIRD BELL
OF THE LEGEND.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.416
THE FINAL KEY

03:22.416 --> 03:25.666
OF THE LOST CITY
OF TINABULA.

03:25.666 --> 03:27.666
IT'S MINE AT LAST!

03:27.666 --> 03:29.041
CORRECTION, MISS DODD.

03:29.041 --> 03:31.124
IT'S MINE AT LAST.

03:31.124 --> 03:34.915
AND I WANT ALL THREE.
THANK YOU.

03:34.915 --> 03:36.208
NO!

03:38.457 --> 03:39.499
AHH!

03:39.499 --> 03:41.624
MADE IN THE SHADE!

03:41.624 --> 03:46.874
NICE BEACH.
NEXT TIME LET'S GET
CLOSER TO THE WATER.

03:46.874 --> 03:50.124
BEATS GOING
ON A FROZEN GOOSE CHASE.

03:50.124 --> 03:52.124
BURIED TREASURE, HA!

03:52.124 --> 03:54.541
DAMSELS IN DISTRESS, HA!

04:06.957 --> 04:08.749
HELP!

04:08.749 --> 04:11.499
DO YOU THINK
WE OUGHT TO--NAH.

04:14.624 --> 04:17.790
YIII!

04:19.874 --> 04:21.666
WE HAVE TO
DO SOMETHING

04:21.666 --> 04:24.832
JUST FOR THE SAKE
OF THE CHAIRS.

04:27.541 --> 04:29.166
ALL SET, LOUIE?

04:29.166 --> 04:32.790

04:37.083 --> 04:38.000
WELL...

04:38.000 --> 04:40.333
HELLO!

04:40.333 --> 04:44.582
DID YOU TELL OFF
THAT SUNDAY
CAMEL DRIVER?

04:44.582 --> 04:48.374
SHE FOLLOWED ME HOME.
CAN I KEEP HER?

04:50.041 --> 04:52.000
WHERE IS THE GIRL?

04:52.000 --> 04:54.499
WE SENT HER PACKING,
MASTER.

04:54.499 --> 04:59.041
WITHOUT HER, I CANNOT FIND
THE WEAPON OF POWER.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.832
THOSE MEDDLERS.
I WANT THAT GIRL BACK.

05:04.832 --> 05:06.208
AFTER THAT PLANE!

05:09.416 --> 05:11.291
UNGAG THE LADY.

05:11.291 --> 05:14.083
SHE PROBABLY WANTS
TO THANK ME.

05:14.083 --> 05:17.874
HEY, I SAW HER FIRST.

05:17.874 --> 05:20.582
PUT ME DOWN,
YOU GOON!

05:20.582 --> 05:22.666
SURE ENOUGH,
SWEET STUFF.

05:22.666 --> 05:25.832
I AM NOT
"SWEET STUFF."

05:25.832 --> 05:27.624
I'M KATIE DODD,
ARCHAEOLOGIST.

05:27.624 --> 05:30.957
TAKE ME TO THE GATHIA
POLICE STATION.

05:30.957 --> 05:34.666
I'LL REPORT THOSE RATS
WHO STOLE MY BELLS.

05:34.666 --> 05:36.416
BELLS?

05:36.416 --> 05:40.041
THE BELLS THAT REVEAL
THE CITY OF TINABULA.

05:40.041 --> 05:41.333
TINABULA?

05:41.333 --> 05:45.957
WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT A LEGENDARY
LOST CITY HERE.

05:45.957 --> 05:48.707
OH, NO, NO.
SORRY, LADY.

05:48.707 --> 05:51.124
NO MORE COCKAMAMIE
TREASURE HUNTS.

05:51.124 --> 05:52.666
SUIT YOURSELVES.

05:52.666 --> 05:55.874
I SUPPOSE
WE COULD JUST LISTEN.

05:55.874 --> 05:57.457
THAT'D BE OK.

05:57.457 --> 06:00.083
OK, HERE'S
THE WHOLE STORY.

06:00.083 --> 06:02.790
ACCORDING TO LEGEND,
3,000 YEARS AGO,

06:02.790 --> 06:06.624
GOLDEN TINABULA
WAS THE GLORY AND WONDER

06:06.624 --> 06:08.041
OF THE WORLD.

06:08.041 --> 06:10.374
NO ONE COULD WITHSTAND
THE MIGHT

06:10.374 --> 06:12.374
OF THEIR EVIL WEAPON.

06:12.374 --> 06:14.333
THEY CONQUERED THE DESERT

06:14.333 --> 06:17.041
AND ACCORDING TO THE LEGEND,

06:17.041 --> 06:19.749
WORSHIPPED STRANGE, HIDEOUS
CREATURES--GIANT SCARABS.

06:19.749 --> 06:22.790
AIN'T THEM
THOSE THINGS YOU GET

06:22.790 --> 06:25.790
WHEN YOU FALL DOWN
AND GO BOOM?

06:25.790 --> 06:27.666
SCARABS, NOT SCABS.

06:27.666 --> 06:30.249
THEY'RE BIG BEATLES,
YOU LUNKHEADS.

06:30.249 --> 06:32.333
SORRY. TELL US MORE.

06:32.333 --> 06:34.457
THEY CARVED STATUES
OF THEM

06:34.457 --> 06:37.749
IN THE CLIFFS
AROUND THE CITY.

06:37.749 --> 06:41.499
ONE DAY, THE DESERT
SWALLOWED THE EVIL CITY

06:41.499 --> 06:44.457
LEAVING NOTHING.
NO WEAPON, NO PEOPLE.

06:44.457 --> 06:45.416
SCARY.

06:45.416 --> 06:48.124
IT'S BEEN LOST EVER SINCE.

06:48.124 --> 06:50.749
AFTER HUNTING
FOR FIVE YEARS,

06:50.749 --> 06:54.790
I FOUND THE KEY--
THE THREE GOLDEN BELLS.

06:54.790 --> 06:57.790
THEIR RING
WILL UNCOVER THE CITY.

06:57.790 --> 07:02.374
I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO KNOWS HOW TO USE THEM,

07:02.374 --> 07:05.749
BUT SOME LOWLIFE
STOLE THEM FROM ME.

07:05.749 --> 07:08.915
I'VE GOT TO GET THEM BACK!
UNDERSTAND?

07:08.915 --> 07:11.499
YEAH, YEAH, SURE!
YEAH, UH-HUH.

07:11.499 --> 07:13.041
HA HA HA!

07:13.041 --> 07:14.166
NO PROBLEM!

07:14.166 --> 07:16.624
WE UNDERSTAND.
YEAH, WE UNDERSTAND.

07:17.582 --> 07:20.249
RED-ROBED RUFFIANS!
HA HA!

07:20.249 --> 07:22.874
MAGIC BELLS!
HA HA HA!

07:22.874 --> 07:27.083
WHAT ABOUT THAT GUN
THAT RUBS OUT CITIES!

07:27.083 --> 07:30.499
LOUIE, MY MAN,
SHE IS A GENUINE
SCREWBALL.

07:30.499 --> 07:32.416
I HEAR YOU.

07:32.416 --> 07:34.374
WAIT UNTIL TOMORROW,
LIEUTENANT!

07:34.374 --> 07:37.083
YOU'LL SEE
I'M TELLING THE TRUTH!

07:37.083 --> 07:38.541
I BELIEVE YOU.

07:38.541 --> 07:41.166
TELL ME AGAIN
OVER DINNER.

07:41.166 --> 07:44.374
I WAS GOING
TO ASK HER OUT!

07:44.374 --> 07:46.124
THANKS FOR SAVING ME,

07:46.124 --> 07:49.499
BUT I'VE GOT
A LOST CITY TO FIND.

07:49.499 --> 07:52.707
I CAN'T AFFORD
TO BE PATRONIZED

07:52.707 --> 07:55.166
BY TWO
GIRL-CRAZY BUFFALOS!

07:56.333 --> 08:00.041
SO WAS THAT A "NO"
FOR DINNER?

08:09.041 --> 08:12.874
AM I A SIGHT
FOR SORE EYES!

08:12.874 --> 08:14.374
OR BLIND ONES.

08:14.374 --> 08:18.874
YOU'RE JEALOUS
BECAUSE MY SUIT
FITS LIKE A GLOVE.

08:18.874 --> 08:20.333
MIGHTY BIG THUMB!

08:20.333 --> 08:24.041
EXCUSE ME.
DO YOU HAVE A RESERVATION?

08:24.041 --> 08:25.957
I'M WITH HIM.

08:25.957 --> 08:27.749
AND
I'M WITH HIM.

08:27.749 --> 08:30.124
OH, IN THAT CASE--
WAIT!

08:30.124 --> 08:31.915
BRUTUS!

08:31.915 --> 08:34.416
MOVE IT OR LOSE IT!

08:36.374 --> 08:39.582
A PRETTY PORT
IN THE STORM.

08:39.582 --> 08:41.582
HI, KATIE.
MISS US?

08:41.582 --> 08:43.749
HEY, YOUSE TWO.

08:48.333 --> 08:51.624
I GUESS THEY'RE WITH ME.

08:51.624 --> 08:54.041
UH...A FALSE ARREST.

08:54.041 --> 08:58.000
THANKS, KATIE BABY.
YOU'RE A LIFESAVER.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.083
SO, UH,
WHAT ARE YOU EATING?

09:01.083 --> 09:01.832
ALONE.

09:01.832 --> 09:04.957
HOW DO YOU
LIKE MY TIE?

09:04.957 --> 09:07.000
MUCH, MUCH TIGHTER.

09:08.707 --> 09:11.624
OHH, SHE DOESN'T
LIKE US.

09:11.624 --> 09:14.333
NOT EVEN
A TEENSY BIT?

09:14.333 --> 09:18.124
YOU GOT ME OUT
OF A TOUGH SPOT.

09:18.124 --> 09:20.333
JUST DON'T
PRESS YOUR LUCK.

09:20.333 --> 09:23.499
MS. ARCHAEOLOGIST,
GIVE US A CHANCE.

09:23.499 --> 09:25.541
WE'LL GROW ON YOU.

09:25.541 --> 09:27.541
YEAH, LIKE FUNGUS.

09:27.541 --> 09:30.624
FELLAS, I APPRECIATE
YOUR HELP, BUT I--

09:30.624 --> 09:33.582
FELLAS? OH, SO FORMAL.

09:33.582 --> 09:34.707
CALL HIM LOUIE.

09:34.707 --> 09:37.083
AND CALL HIM
NEXT YEAR.

09:37.083 --> 09:38.541
BALOO.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.541
THANKS FOR
AN INTERESTING
EVENING.

09:42.541 --> 09:44.790
IS THIS YOUR ROOM?

09:44.790 --> 09:46.874
WE'RE JUST

09:46.874 --> 09:48.666
WHAT A COINKIDINK!

09:48.666 --> 09:50.874
YES, ISN'T IT?

09:51.874 --> 09:53.083
WELL, GOOD NIGHT.

YELL IF YOU
NEED ANYTHING.

09:57.915 --> 10:00.249

10:00.249 --> 10:02.291
YOU SCARED HER OFF.

10:02.291 --> 10:06.457
WHY DIDN'T YOU WEAR
THAT MASK I BOUGHT YOU?

10:06.457 --> 10:08.499
AFTER STARING AT YOU,

10:08.499 --> 10:10.333
WE'LL NEVER HEAR
FROM HER AGAIN.

10:10.333 --> 10:11.083
AAH!

10:11.083 --> 10:12.790
KATIE!

10:18.249 --> 10:20.000

UH, THANKS, PAL.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.083

TA-DA! JUST LIKE
A BIRTHDAY PRESENT.

11:21.707 --> 11:24.666

WE CAN'T HANDLE.

11:30.666 --> 11:34.041
I'M GETTING SICK
OF THIS!

11:34.041 --> 11:37.457
CAN'T THOSE GUYS
FIND THEIR OWN GIRL?

11:38.707 --> 11:41.166
GIVE ME A BOOST,
LOUIE.

11:43.416 --> 11:45.832
HURRY UP!

11:45.832 --> 11:50.000
OH, TOO BAD

12:14.832 --> 12:18.208
YOU'RE JEALOUS 'CAUSE
SHE LIKES ME BETTER.

12:18.208 --> 12:21.915
YOU KEEP THIS UP,
I'LL LOSE MY MIND.

12:21.915 --> 12:24.374
YOU WON'T MISS IT.

12:37.124 --> 12:39.291
UH-OH.

12:39.291 --> 12:42.582
