You wanna walk away

-Right in the heart!
-Straight through the heart!

14:36.570 --> 14:40.104
We should have shot...

14:40.106 --> 14:42.039
...a small one.

14:42.041 --> 14:44.908
This one is wrecking my car.

14:44.910 --> 14:49.245
No this is a good one,
plenty of meat.

14:57.188 --> 14:58.554
Where?

14:58.556 --> 15:00.555
In the trees.

15:03.426 --> 15:04.958
It's a policeman!

15:04.960 --> 15:06.426
A policeman's parked there!

15:06.428 --> 15:09.228
Sit down, sit down!

15:13.100 --> 15:14.332
Don't panic...

15:14.334 --> 15:16.300
sit down slowly.

15:16.302 --> 15:18.502
Sit down very slowly.

15:20.572 --> 15:22.972
I better sit down slowly too.

15:34.051 --> 15:35.984

15:54.102 --> 15:56.635
Petrol,
keep the car going.

Me, that's mine.

16:18.456 --> 16:21.190
And the other one
was mine.

16:21.192 --> 16:23.291
Did y'all purchase
permits for 'em?

16:26.195 --> 16:27.727
You got a license?

16:27.729 --> 16:29.028
License?

16:29.030 --> 16:30.429
We're not gonna
drive them,

16:30.431 --> 16:31.696
we're just gonna shoot 'em.

16:31.698 --> 16:33.698

16:55.384 --> 16:59.452
And your rifle and my gun.

16:59.454 --> 17:02.655
And all that tender meat.

17:02.657 --> 17:04.289
That'll soon stink up
the whole police station!

17:04.291 --> 17:07.458

We need to teach them

24:02.979 --> 24:05.446
the traditional ways.

24:09.752 --> 24:12.952
Get Bobby to teach them.

24:15.489 --> 24:18.056
He can do it.

24:18.058 --> 24:20.525
He knows how to lead them.

be trouble.

25:11.706 --> 25:13.906

25:13.908 --> 25:17.109
Heard you might be able
to track 'em for us.

25:17.111 --> 25:18.510

25:32.556 --> 25:33.821
but it's just...

25:33.823 --> 25:35.155
it's isolated,
it's remote.

25:35.157 --> 25:36.556
Don't know.

25:36.558 --> 25:37.256
I'm one for the big city,

25:37.258 --> 25:39.224
you know PC?

25:39.226 --> 25:40.858
Hmm.

25:40.860 --> 25:42.860
-Yup.
-I like the high life.

25:42.862 --> 25:43.827
Stop, stop, stop.

25:43.829 --> 25:45.628
Stop, stop.

25:48.599 --> 25:51.032
(engine rumbles in idle)

25:58.241 --> 25:59.974
Get out.

26:05.547 --> 26:08.614
(car doors shut)

26:41.582 --> 26:45.617
That drive there
means stop.

26:45.619 --> 26:49.087
And here,
came back here,

26:49.089 --> 26:50.922
and then he went this way.

26:53.259 --> 26:56.727
Yesterday 10 o'clock.

26:56.729 --> 27:00.630
Damn, you black fellas
are smart when you wanna be.

27:00.632 --> 27:02.164
Jesus.

27:02.166 --> 27:03.231
Yeah.

27:03.233 --> 27:05.833
(engine rumbling)

27:27.122 --> 27:30.389
Hey, hey, come here.

27:30.391 --> 27:33.792
Shh, down, down, down,
down, down, down.

27:35.228 --> 27:37.061
Come, come.

27:37.963 --> 27:39.629
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

27:44.702 --> 27:45.967
Right there.

27:45.969 --> 27:49.836
It's...it's two cars
with a tent.

27:51.272 --> 27:52.838
They're camping.

27:52.840 --> 27:54.272
-Okay?
-Okay.

27:54.274 --> 27:56.040
You'll be all right now?

27:56.042 --> 27:57.841
I'm going back to town.

27:57.843 --> 27:58.842
What?

27:58.844 --> 28:01.010
It's 15 kilometers away.

28:01.012 --> 28:03.412
Shortcut through the bush.

28:03.414 --> 28:05.347
See you later.

28:12.355 --> 28:14.421
(leaves rustling)

28:18.393 --> 28:21.093
(chuckles)

28:29.836 --> 28:32.236
(crickets chirring)

28:50.122 --> 28:53.123
Anything to smoke?

28:53.125 --> 28:55.458
(laughing)

29:02.966 --> 29:04.899
The cops nearly caught me,

29:04.901 --> 29:09.703
but those white fellas
got caught good and proper,

29:09.705 --> 29:11.971
and I'd got this

29:11.973 --> 29:14.907
but I hadn't
paid him yet either.

29:14.909 --> 29:18.377
(laughing)

29:18.379 --> 29:21.279
Serves him right,
always ripping us off.

29:21.281 --> 29:23.247
Is this worth fifty dollars?

29:23.249 --> 29:27.384
-No fucking way!
-It's big money.

29:27.386 --> 29:29.285
And I didn't pay him!

29:29.287 --> 29:30.919
(chuckles)

29:44.834 --> 29:46.967
Can you look
after him for a bit?

29:46.969 --> 29:50.036
Stuff to do...

29:50.038 --> 29:52.104
See you later.

29:54.141 --> 29:56.808
See you.

29:58.044 --> 30:00.110
He won't go anywhere.

30:12.857 --> 30:15.524
(birds squawking)

30:45.789 --> 30:48.856
You know I'm sick don't you?

30:50.860 --> 30:55.262
My kidneys are no good.

30:55.264 --> 30:57.831
Soon they'll stop working.

31:02.404 --> 31:04.170
Yeah.

31:04.172 --> 31:07.573
I know you're sick.

31:07.575 --> 31:09.575
I know that.

31:13.547 --> 31:15.246
(chuckles)

31:18.384 --> 31:20.984
It's all that...

31:20.986 --> 31:24.320
...white man junk food we eat.

31:28.859 --> 31:31.226
They'll take me to Darwin.

31:39.969 --> 31:45.004
Then you'll die
in the wrong place...

31:45.006 --> 31:48.907
...a long way
from your country.

31:53.413 --> 31:55.246
A long way.

32:04.990 --> 32:09.992
There'll be no one with you...

32:09.994 --> 32:12.260
...no one to look after you.

32:21.104 --> 32:22.903
(door slams)

32:24.506 --> 32:27.240
Right, we'll put you down
as a recreational shooter then.

32:27.242 --> 32:28.641
What?

32:28.643 --> 32:30.376
Recreational?

32:30.378 --> 32:32.511
Hunting is not
recreational.

32:32.513 --> 32:33.645
It's for food.

32:33.647 --> 32:37.148
You still need a license.

32:37.150 --> 32:40.050
How much it gonna cost me?

32:40.052 --> 32:41.284
Sixty dollars.

32:41.286 --> 32:44.120
Sixty dollars
to buy my gun back?

32:44.122 --> 32:46.288
Charlie, you're not
getting your gun back.

32:46.290 --> 32:49.658
It's been confiscated.

32:49.660 --> 32:51.893
You're stealing it.

32:51.895 --> 32:54.428
Look, you can't have
a purchase permit for it.

32:54.430 --> 32:55.996
All right, you illegally
modified it

32:55.998 --> 32:57.297
to be a concealable weapon.

32:57.299 --> 32:59.464
You're lucky Brum
didn't charge you!

33:03.036 --> 33:05.436
But I didn't know that.

33:05.438 --> 33:08.071
I know,
it's just not an excuse.

33:12.376 --> 33:14.943
(crickets chirring)

33:24.120 --> 33:27.454
I'm not
a recreational shooter...

33:27.456 --> 33:32.325
¶

33:32.327 --> 33:35.661
I am...

33:35.663 --> 33:37.529
...a hunter.

33:42.268 --> 33:46.003
¶

33:46.005 --> 33:50.573
I danced for

33:50.575 --> 33:54.677
the Queen of England

33:54.679 --> 33:58.147
when they opened
that building...

33:58.149 --> 34:01.450
I bet you never did that.

34:01.452 --> 34:06.054
¶

34:09.059 --> 34:11.292
(coughs, wheezes)

34:11.294 --> 34:12.259
And again.

34:12.261 --> 34:14.660
(coughs)

34:16.530 --> 34:18.329
Okay.

34:22.668 --> 34:25.100
Good thing you gave up
smoking when you did, Charlie.

34:27.637 --> 34:29.470
Your lungs
are packin' it in.

34:30.639 --> 34:32.171
Next time you're in Darwin,

34:32.173 --> 34:35.140
we should get
your chest X-rayed.

34:35.142 --> 34:37.575
But you gotta
look after yourself.

34:37.577 --> 34:40.978
No more ganja, okay?

34:40.980 --> 34:43.580
And you need
to eat better.

34:43.582 --> 34:45.148
Eat what?

34:45.150 --> 34:48.718
White fella junk food?

34:48.720 --> 34:50.286
Yeah, it's a problem.

34:50.288 --> 34:53.155
Fuckin' yeah, it's a problem.

34:53.157 --> 34:55.023
See this? Doesn't fit.

34:55.025 --> 34:56.657
I can't eat with 'em,

34:56.659 --> 34:59.761
and I can't eat
without them.

34:59.763 --> 35:02.263
I'm starving.

35:02.265 --> 35:04.098
Well, look,
I'm not the dentist.

35:04.100 --> 35:06.467
You gotta wait
for the dentist to come.

35:06.469 --> 35:08.469
I'll be dead by then.

35:08.471 --> 35:10.137
(chuffs)

35:53.882 --> 35:57.550
What are you doing?

35:57.552 --> 36:00.152
Making a spear.

36:02.756 --> 36:05.156
Why?

36:05.158 --> 36:06.490
For hunting.

36:09.761 --> 36:11.894
Catch something to eat.

36:11.896 --> 36:14.496
Why don't you use a gun?

36:14.498 --> 36:16.764
Why don't you go away?

36:16.766 --> 36:18.766
Go and play somewhere.

36:36.351 --> 36:37.817
One, two, three.

36:37.819 --> 36:39.718
(grunts)

36:40.887 --> 36:43.320
(muffled chatter)

36:54.232 --> 36:56.632
(plane engine hums)

37:40.977 --> 37:43.443
(truck rattling)

37:46.648 --> 37:48.414
-Hey Charlie.
-Hey Luke!

37:48.416 --> 37:52.284
What do you got there?

37:52.286 --> 37:53.351
I made a spear.

37:53.353 --> 37:55.653
Hunting spear.

37:55.655 --> 37:57.488
Wow.

37:57.490 --> 37:59.756
It's incredible
but I'm gonna have to take it.

37:59.758 --> 38:01.023
What?

38:01.025 --> 38:02.391
Well, you can't just go
walking through town

38:02.393 --> 38:03.492
with a dangerous weapon.

38:03.494 --> 38:04.893
It's not a dangerous weapon.

38:04.895 --> 38:07.662
It's a hunting spear,
not a battle spear.

38:07.664 --> 38:09.363
You know what happened
in that other community.

38:09.365 --> 38:11.398
One bloke dead and the other
one in the hospital.

38:11.400 --> 38:12.799
But you took my gun!

38:12.801 --> 38:14.300
Come on.

38:15.903 --> 38:17.269
It's a dangerous weapon,

38:17.271 --> 38:19.570
I'm gonna have
to destroy it.

38:23.042 --> 38:25.275
Well, fuck you then.

38:25.277 --> 38:27.577
Treacherous bastard!

38:46.497 --> 38:51.666
Fuck those thieving...

38:51.668 --> 38:53.434
...white bastards.

39:04.813 --> 39:06.846
(howling)

39:08.549 --> 39:10.982
(dogs barking)

39:32.671 --> 39:35.004
Why did you come here?

39:36.674 --> 39:41.376
From far away...
stealing people's stuff!

39:41.378 --> 39:43.378
Is this your land?

39:50.720 --> 39:52.786
Fucking bastard.

39:52.788 --> 39:55.088
(overlapping chatter)

39:55.090 --> 39:57.457
I need to get money too.

39:57.459 --> 40:00.793
I want my money!

40:00.795 --> 40:05.063
All my money, the whole lot!

40:05.065 --> 40:07.732
Where is it? I need it now!

40:18.911 --> 40:22.579
(muffled talking)

40:22.581 --> 40:24.881
(laughing)

40:42.633 --> 40:44.833
(car approaching)

40:46.770 --> 40:48.836
What's going on?

40:50.406 --> 40:52.172
That's a police car!

40:52.174 --> 40:53.973
I'm borrowing it.

40:56.944 --> 41:01.846
They took your rifle...

41:01.848 --> 41:03.447
...and your car.

41:05.651 --> 41:11.120
They took my spear...

41:11.122 --> 41:13.055
...and my gun.

41:17.994 --> 41:21.628
I work for them
catching criminals

41:21.630 --> 41:24.464
and they don't pay me.

41:30.171 --> 41:33.906
They stole our land

41:33.908 --> 41:37.709
and put a police station on it.

41:44.550 --> 41:46.783
They're lucky.

41:46.785 --> 41:49.986
<i>I'm only borrowing their car!</i>

41:49.988 --> 41:51.854
We'll bring it back later.

41:58.128 --> 42:00.795
Where are we going?

42:00.797 --> 42:02.730
Live the old way.

42:05.501 --> 42:07.968
What's that for?

42:07.970 --> 42:09.835
No electricity there.

42:13.173 --> 42:15.106
Carrying water.

42:22.047 --> 42:25.515
Where we used
to sleep as kids...

42:25.517 --> 42:27.850
...we'll hunt and fish there.

42:30.921 --> 42:33.922
(excited talking)

42:33.924 --> 42:36.824
...going bush, going bush...

42:36.826 --> 42:39.193
...going to my
Mother Country...

42:39.195 --> 42:40.794
...yes, your Mother Country...

42:40.796 --> 42:43.563
(cheering)

42:43.565 --> 42:45.798
(car revs)

42:47.902 --> 42:49.835
Second, second.

43:06.052 --> 43:08.652
This is not
your Mother Country.

43:08.654 --> 43:11.721
No. This is where
we run out of fuel!

43:11.723 --> 43:13.222
The fuel's run out!

43:13.224 --> 43:14.656
(laughing)

43:14.658 --> 43:16.190
We've barely left...

43:16.192 --> 43:19.193
...and we've already
run out of fuel!

43:23.065 --> 43:27.167
-I'm off then. See you.
-Yeah.

43:27.169 --> 43:30.937
You'll be back as soon
as you're hungry!

43:30.939 --> 43:33.205
Plenty of food out there!

43:33.207 --> 43:35.840
(laughs)

43:35.842 --> 43:38.108

just right, Fish...

49:44.571 --> 49:47.305
Very good, Fish.

49:48.441 --> 49:50.240
Good fish, yeah.

49:55.180 --> 49:57.547
(chuckling)

50:03.054 --> 50:06.522
I've been away fishing,
now I'm home.

50:10.727 --> 50:12.359
I'm eating well.

50:16.631 --> 50:19.365
It's my own supermarket.

50:19.367 --> 50:22.601
Here, I'll wrap
some fish for you.

50:22.603 --> 50:25.069
Just a minute...I'm busy.

50:28.607 --> 50:31.474
I'm free now!

50:31.476 --> 50:34.076
Yeah.

50:34.078 --> 50:35.077
Lot of fish...

50:35.079 --> 50:36.578
I have my own supermarket!

50:36.580 --> 50:37.779
Yeah!

50:37.781 --> 50:39.046

50:39.048 --> 50:40.447
And this is my country!

50:40.449 --> 50:41.448
I can dance with it!

The ancestors
used to eat these.

55:32.765 --> 55:34.431
Ashes.

55:36.635 --> 55:38.901
They'd sit by the fire here.

55:43.907 --> 55:48.976
They've all passed on.

55:48.978 --> 55:49.910
Gone.

55:49.912 --> 55:52.645

the Sydney Opera House...

I thought I told you
to look after yourself.

1:04:02.859 --> 1:04:04.091
We need to get him
to hospital.

1:04:04.093 --> 1:04:05.358
Today?

1:04:05.360 --> 1:04:07.226
See if the medevac's

1:04:07.228 --> 1:04:10.128

you're looking

1:05:49.853 --> 1:05:51.385
Do you mind if I call
you Charlie?

1:05:51.387 --> 1:05:55.122

You a doctor?

Yes, yes.

Well, I, uh...

1:06:11.404 --> 1:06:15.005
I believe you were
found in the bush, Charlie.

1:06:15.007 --> 1:06:17.040
I born in the bush.

1:06:17.042 --> 1:06:20.910
I didn't find me
in the bush.

1:06:20.912 --> 1:06:24.113

your sense of humor, ey?

-I'm leaving.
-Are you? Okay.

1:09:49.906 --> 1:09:51.472
Um, is there something
I can help you with?

1:09:51.474 --> 1:09:52.806
No, you can't
keep me here.

1:09:52.808 --> 1:09:53.807
Yeah, but you're
not well, okay?

1:09:53.809 --> 1:09:55.275
You haven't been discharged.

1:09:55.277 --> 1:09:56.643

I'm okay...

1:11:12.544 --> 1:11:14.443
I'm allowed to buy it.

1:11:19.749 --> 1:11:21.748
This one.

1:11:25.286 --> 1:11:27.286
Something else as well.

1:11:51.645 --> 1:11:53.511
Give him your I.D.

1:11:56.649 --> 1:11:58.515
Got some I.D., mate?

1:11:58.517 --> 1:11:59.983
Yeah, yeah.

Yeah, all good.

1:12:27.076 --> 1:12:29.443
Right.

Going home to have a drink.

1:13:05.042 --> 1:13:06.674
Wait! It's the cops.

1:13:06.676 --> 1:13:08.442

to do than clean up

1:13:08.444 --> 1:13:10.410
after you lot!

1:13:10.412 --> 1:13:13.446
Quick. Hide the grog!

-I'm allowed.
-But I'm banned.

1:13:15.917 --> 1:13:17.650
I'm banned!

1:13:17.652 --> 1:13:22.521
If you give me grog then
you'll be banned and go to jail.

1:13:22.523 --> 1:13:26.358
You know you're not
supposed to camp here!

1:13:26.360 --> 1:13:29.527
Piss off!

1:13:29.529 --> 1:13:31.795
Go back to your community!

All's clear,

1:22:00.248 --> 1:22:03.849
You know, you can't just
sit on the grass all day

1:22:03.851 --> 1:22:06.418
and call it "the old ways."

1:22:06.420 --> 1:22:08.820
These times have changed.

1:22:08.822 --> 1:22:10.322
No, they haven't.

1:22:10.324 --> 1:22:12.590
You're still trying
to change our culture

1:22:12.592 --> 1:22:16.393
to your bastard culture!

1:22:16.395 --> 1:22:18.261
Fuck you!

1:22:23.501 --> 1:22:25.033
(clears throat)

1:22:25.035 --> 1:22:30.571
In--in this particular
situation...

1:22:30.573 --> 1:22:34.308
moreover the defendant
in no way

1:22:34.310 --> 1:22:37.344
denies the attack,

1:22:37.346 --> 1:22:41.381
and has shown nothing
in the way of remorse.

1:22:42.717 --> 1:22:47.186
I find against him
on all charges.

1:22:51.192 --> 1:22:54.193
Does the defendant
have anything to say

1:22:54.195 --> 1:22:56.461
before sentencing?

1:23:09.509 --> 1:23:12.109
(speaking foreign language)

1:23:17.482 --> 1:23:21.450
This mean my country

1:23:21.452 --> 1:23:23.185
is my home.

1:23:25.355 --> 1:23:27.988
(speaking foreign language)

1:23:46.307 --> 1:23:50.309
That means...

1:23:50.311 --> 1:23:53.512
I was living in my home

1:23:53.514 --> 1:23:56.615
nice and peacefully,

1:23:56.617 --> 1:24:01.786
then the police came

1:24:01.788 --> 1:24:03.521
to throw me out.

1:24:10.396 --> 1:24:12.796
(speaking foreign language)

1:24:15.600 --> 1:24:18.400
That mean...

1:24:18.402 --> 1:24:20.468
nothing more to say.

1:24:25.207 --> 1:24:27.607

1:29:46.511 --> 1:29:49.512
Hard to talk to you

1:29:49.514 --> 1:29:51.647
when you don't look like you.

1:30:04.694 --> 1:30:08.095
I got that license
for my rifle.

1:30:24.646 --> 1:30:27.079
They're teaching me here,

1:30:27.081 --> 1:30:29.648
then I'll go back,

1:30:29.650 --> 1:30:31.850
and I'll work
in my own country.

1:30:51.570 --> 1:30:52.969
I'm going.

1:32:38.868 --> 1:32:40.534
All right,
so when you're considered

1:32:40.536 --> 1:32:41.735
for parole, Charlie.

1:32:41.737 --> 1:32:44.204
-When?
-When?

1:32:44.206 --> 1:32:46.039
I don't know,
not for a few months yet,

1:32:46.041 --> 1:32:47.540
but when you are...

1:32:47.542 --> 1:32:49.041
where do you think
you might go?

1:32:49.043 --> 1:32:52.044
I don't know.

1:32:52.046 --> 1:32:54.913
Somewhere.

1:32:54.915 --> 1:32:57.181
What about going back
to your community?

1:32:57.183 --> 1:32:59.016
You can live
your own way.

1:33:00.219 --> 1:33:03.053
No.

1:33:03.055 --> 1:33:07.524
White fellas locked me up
for being aboriginal.

1:33:07.526 --> 1:33:09.726
I wanted to live in
the white fella's way now.

1:33:14.599 --> 1:33:16.998
(heavy footsteps)

Fucking...

1:33:57.968 --> 1:33:59.634
(plates tap on table)

1:34:28.797 --> 1:34:31.130
You're gonna
report to me weekly.

1:34:31.132 --> 1:34:33.732
You're gonna
show up on time.

1:34:33.734 --> 1:34:35.934
And another condition
is that you'll be banned

1:34:35.936 --> 1:34:37.201
from buying alcohol.

1:34:37.203 --> 1:34:38.969
I'm giving up drinking anyway.

1:34:38.971 --> 1:34:40.270
That's good.

1:34:40.272 --> 1:34:41.938
And you won't be allowed
to associate

1:34:41.940 --> 1:34:43.339
with known drinkers.

1:34:43.341 --> 1:34:47.810
Everyone in this country
are known drinkers.

1:34:47.812 --> 1:34:51.046
Yeah, this means
known to the police.

1:34:51.048 --> 1:34:54.215
Police are known drinkers.

1:34:54.217 --> 1:34:57.651
Tell them not
to associate with me.

1:34:57.653 --> 1:34:59.686
Okay, all right.

1:34:59.688 --> 1:35:01.054
I'm gonna arrange
for you to stay

1:35:01.056 --> 1:35:03.122
at a dry house
for the first month.

1:35:03.124 --> 1:35:05.691
It's not the easiest
of places, Charlie.

1:35:05.693 --> 1:35:06.725
But given what you want,

1:35:06.727 --> 1:35:08.727
that's the best I can do.

Where's all the decent food?

1:39:41.254 --> 1:39:45.955
The food in prison
is better than this.

1:39:45.957 --> 1:39:48.424
Ah, doesn't matter.

1:40:16.451 --> 1:40:18.284

1:40:18.286 --> 1:40:23.588
I had to get this ranger
to find you.

1:40:23.590 --> 1:40:26.090
He's always finding me
in the bush.

1:40:26.092 --> 1:40:28.392
(laughing)

1:40:28.394 --> 1:40:33.296
How come you don't
answer your phone?

1:40:33.298 --> 1:40:34.263
Old number.

1:40:38.636 --> 1:40:41.637
What's the new number then?

1:40:41.639 --> 1:40:44.172
Only got old number.

1:40:55.651 --> 1:41:02.155
You going to come
and teach the kids to dance?

1:41:02.157 --> 1:41:05.958
No...not me...

1:41:05.960 --> 1:41:08.160
...get Bobby
to teach those kids.

1:41:08.162 --> 1:41:10.295
He knows how to do it.

1:41:10.297 --> 1:41:12.964
Bobby's crook.

1:41:12.966 --> 1:41:15.566
His lungs are bad.

1:41:17.102 --> 1:41:20.270
Yeah, Bobby smokes too much.

Very big.
