Psssh. No! No way!
Haha, what!

What? Us?
No. no, no. No way!

No, we like doin'
a little DIY, right?

‐No.

‐Alright, hit us
with the good news.
‐What?! No...

00:53.800 --> 00:56.010
No, Rae. You want
the bad news first.

00:56.010 --> 00:57.680
That way, the good news
swoops in and...

00:57.680 --> 00:59.050
you know,
makes you feel better.

01:00.430 --> 01:02.640
Alright, so, uh,

So we can savor it.
Really enjoy it.

Oh, that's‐that is bad.

‐That's bad.
‐But, she recovered.

‐Oh! Yeah!

treat her carefully.
