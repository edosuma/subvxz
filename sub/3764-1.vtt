00:36.619 --> 00:38.161
Senators, I tell you.

00:38.328 --> 00:40.621
Those who escaped the claws of the lion

00:40.788 --> 00:43.246
will be poisoned by the venom of the snake.

00:43.413 --> 00:44.663
There are too many critters.

00:44.830 --> 00:46.915
- It's not literally.
- What?

00:49.665 --> 00:51.708
O Caesar... what do you mean

00:51.875 --> 00:53.667
by "snake venom"?

00:53.834 --> 00:56.794
- And by "the claws of the lion"?
- I get it.

00:56.960 --> 00:59.628
Lion! The invincible power of Rome!

00:59.795 --> 01:02.755
Like greenhouses falcon, it has closed...

01:02.922 --> 01:04.464
- There is a falcon?
- Shh!

01:04.631 --> 01:06.464
As the greenhouses of the hawk,

01:06.631 --> 01:09.383
it is closed on all continents,

01:09.549 --> 01:10.674
except here in Brittany,

01:11.050 --> 01:12.092
where a handful

01:12.258 --> 01:17.386
of indomitable Gauls still
laugh beak The Imperial Eagle.

01:18.386 --> 01:20.553
The Imperial Eagle, it is a problem

01:20.720 --> 01:21.720
to someone?

01:22.679 --> 01:24.721
These barbarians refuse Rome?

01:24.806 --> 01:27.264
So it is Rome that will go to them.

01:29.641 --> 01:31.974
Uh... That's it? It is now?

01:32.141 --> 01:33.141
Yes now.

01:35.393 --> 01:36.936
This is the venom of the snake.

01:37.102 --> 01:40.229
Their forests give way
to glorious buildings.

01:40.395 --> 01:42.729
Surrounded by the Roman civilization,

01:42.896 --> 01:45.189
they will have to adapt or disappear.

01:47.040 --> 01:48.732
I entrusted the construction

01:48.898 --> 01:52.525
our beautiful city the
young architect Anglaigus.

01:52.691 --> 01:54.567
He designed many buildings

01:54.734 --> 01:57.944
many of which do not collapse.

01:59.486 --> 02:02.071
Congratulations Anglaigus! I adore.

02:02.238 --> 02:03.780
Beautiful little model!

02:03.947 --> 02:06.572
How do you call him your glorious city?

02:06.739 --> 02:08.782
I thought... It was so bad.

02:08.949 --> 02:10.616
So I have not insisted.

02:10.782 --> 02:12.825
What do you suggest, Senator Prospectus?

02:13.325 --> 02:17.244
There should be a name that evokes Rome...

02:17.411 --> 02:19.370
But that is not really Rome.

02:20.453 --> 02:22.037
- Rume?
- Rume?

02:22.204 --> 02:23.704
It's not really Rome.

02:23.871 --> 02:25.872
I fear being confused with...

02:26.039 --> 02:28.081
Good. What are you think...

02:28.832 --> 02:30.541
Domaine gods?

02:30.874 --> 02:32.500
The Domain of the Gods?

02:35.376 --> 02:36.835
I'm not sure...

02:38.168 --> 02:39.378
Oh if, as well, it's not bad.

04:54.975 --> 04:55.975
Cuckoo!

04:56.684 --> 04:58.518
This one's for you, Obelix.

04:58.685 --> 05:00.436
Obviously, I saw the 1st.

05:00.603 --> 05:02.061
- Really?
- Perfectly!

05:02.228 --> 05:03.979
He is afraid of me, not you!

05:04.146 --> 05:05.937
Really? You talked about?

05:06.104 --> 05:07.980
I see the first wild boar.

05:08.147 --> 05:10.523
Is that I flaps under your nose?

05:10.690 --> 05:13.149
- Ah here!
- Môssieur is essential!

05:13.316 --> 05:14.608
You're done, right?

05:14.774 --> 05:16.317
I'm the fastest.

05:16.484 --> 05:17.651
To eat them.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.152
- This is mine!
- I Will Not!

05:19.319 --> 05:20.569
- Yes!
- I Will Not!

05:24.196 --> 05:25.196
Yes!

05:37.451 --> 05:38.659
Obelix!

05:39.452 --> 05:40.952
My boar...

05:41.411 --> 05:43.620
called "back"!

05:44.454 --> 05:46.413
It's not your boar!

06:06.671 --> 06:09.088
What is it, by Toutatis?

06:38.059 --> 06:43.019
121, 122, 123, 124, 125...
Sorry, sorry...

06:43.186 --> 06:44.937
126, 127,

06:45.771 --> 06:46.771
and... 128!

06:46.812 --> 06:49.147
This is the first tree to be felled.

06:52.607 --> 06:54.608
By Vesta! Remove me that!

06:55.316 --> 06:56.316
Lying!

06:56.942 --> 06:59.527
It should not touch the trees, Roman.

06:59.693 --> 07:01.402
Idéfix hates that.

07:01.568 --> 07:03.736
Come on, Dogmatix! Enough is enough!

07:05.695 --> 07:07.738
Get out of here now!

07:07.905 --> 07:11.615
The site is strictly forbidden
to the public. Is that clear?

07:26.704 --> 07:28.788
I like the Romans without armor.

07:29.163 --> 07:31.706
They make a nice sound when they fall.

07:44.169 --> 07:47.796
O Abraracourcix our leader,
we need to talk to you!

07:47.963 --> 07:51.005
He is in a meeting. Can I take a message?

07:53.090 --> 07:54.257
I'm listening.

07:54.423 --> 07:55.758
What is happening?

07:55.924 --> 07:57.841
A Fish Story not fresh...

07:58.008 --> 07:59.300
What do you mean not fresh?

07:59.467 --> 08:01.802
I was responding to a question!

08:01.969 --> 08:02.969
Go for it!

08:03.052 --> 08:05.178
We stumbled upon the Romans.

08:05.345 --> 08:08.763
- From the Romans with strings.
- What kind strings?

08:08.930 --> 08:10.806
Where one begins in the feet.

08:10.973 --> 08:13.765
It would be a prohibited public site.

08:14.099 --> 08:16.558
What is this site?

08:16.724 --> 08:18.934
Strings, it's not too serious.

08:19.101 --> 08:21.018
Come On! It returns!

08:22.435 --> 08:25.603
Go watch me this site. You never know.

08:25.770 --> 08:28.021
Hey, we made our report!

08:28.187 --> 08:29.564
He finished your report!

08:39.609 --> 08:43.485
It is intolerable that
mustached barbarians threaten

08:43.652 --> 08:45.152
Caesar plans!

08:45.319 --> 08:48.612
The Gauls do not like
to touch their forest.

08:48.779 --> 08:49.779
Their forest?

08:49.863 --> 08:51.823
Stop moving, please.

08:51.989 --> 08:53.532
By Juno, which they believe is?

08:53.698 --> 08:56.116
They think they are home.
That's the problem.

08:56.283 --> 08:58.617
Well up to civilization.

08:58.783 --> 09:00.576
We will deforest their forest.

09:00.742 --> 09:02.326
Be the first dégauloiser.

09:02.493 --> 09:05.578
For this, Caesar counting on you.
And I believe...

09:05.744 --> 09:09.997
- Ave, Centurion!
- What he has, Slaves

09:10.163 --> 09:11.414
complain of inactivity.

09:11.581 --> 09:13.790
Operations are suspended

09:13.957 --> 09:15.457
for securing the site.

09:16.666 --> 09:19.084
- How To? - How what?
- I understood nothing.

09:19.250 --> 09:20.585
Well, that's okay.

09:21.209 --> 09:24.377
Anglaigus to avoid the Gauls,
we must work at night.

09:24.544 --> 09:27.337
A night site! Anything!

09:27.504 --> 09:29.504
As your bandage!

09:39.301 --> 09:42.719
Centurion! My staff and I are undecided.

09:42.884 --> 09:44.052
Should we draw?

09:44.219 --> 09:47.429
You need to repeat it?
You wait for my signal.

09:47.596 --> 09:49.638
What is your signal, already?

09:49.804 --> 09:52.472
For the 30th time it is when I get the arm.

09:52.639 --> 09:53.723
Very much so.

10:02.810 --> 10:04.436
What are we waiting for, by Jupiter?

10:05.769 --> 10:07.186
What are we waiting for?

10:07.353 --> 10:09.104
The report of my scouts.

10:09.271 --> 10:13.231
Centurion! You make too much
gossip with angry architect.

10:13.398 --> 10:14.398
It's dangerous.

10:14.565 --> 10:15.982
Back in the ranks!

10:16.858 --> 10:17.858
The whip cracks.

10:18.025 --> 10:19.984
The tree crack.

10:27.778 --> 10:30.070
But what you manufacture?

10:30.155 --> 10:31.464
- You raised his arm.
- I Do Not.

10:31.488 --> 10:33.281
Oh yes! So, clack!

10:33.448 --> 10:34.865
I gave the signal.

10:35.282 --> 10:36.282
Ave, Centurion.

10:36.365 --> 10:38.241
- Scouts to the report.
- Where were you?

10:38.408 --> 10:40.367
- There!
- What you light here?

10:40.534 --> 10:42.868
It was not far
because the Gau...

10:43.035 --> 10:44.160
I can not hear. Because?

10:44.327 --> 10:45.536
GAULOIS OF!

10:46.453 --> 10:49.038
Gauls? Humerus sounds the retreat!

10:53.789 --> 10:54.914
Ave, Centurion!

10:56.415 --> 10:58.708
Come back, band of morons!

11:00.375 --> 11:01.667
Ho bah...

11:17.382 --> 11:18.382
Idéfix!

11:20.508 --> 11:22.801
What happens now?

11:25.177 --> 11:27.261
A shot of the Romans.

11:33.639 --> 11:37.015
That, Idéfix. Everything is back in order.

11:49.145 --> 11:51.355
What for those not in the head, again.

11:51.521 --> 11:53.332
- Just Listen.
- One tree per night?

11:53.356 --> 11:55.023
You shove your finger

11:55.190 --> 11:57.273
- in the eye to the ulna.
- Present!

11:57.440 --> 11:59.941
The farm, Ulna! Not just stand there!

12:00.108 --> 12:01.817
Where is the tree ripped yesterday?

12:01.984 --> 12:05.402
I do not have very good news.
It is not torn.

12:05.569 --> 12:06.569
What?

12:06.611 --> 12:07.944
The tree is replanted.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.112
Replanted figuratively?

12:10.279 --> 12:14.197
No, no... Replanted under "replanted".
Look At.

12:15.281 --> 12:16.948
No, but it is not true!

12:17.115 --> 12:18.908
But this is not true!

12:19.075 --> 12:23.096
- Centurion! The architect of fuss again!
- Silence!

12:23.121 --> 12:25.559
Enough is enough! We go!
We can not fight.

12:25.702 --> 12:27.994
- I Will Not! They pull off this tree.
- Yet Again?

12:28.161 --> 12:30.704
Yes I Am. And will report to camp!

12:30.871 --> 12:34.373
Wait... Our function provides
the uprooting of trees,

12:34.538 --> 12:36.082
but their transportation...

12:36.247 --> 12:39.874
You are slaves. You obey
the buckle and you!

12:40.041 --> 12:42.542
Centurion is you who make the fuss!

12:42.709 --> 12:44.293
Shut up! And you, pull!

12:46.460 --> 12:48.920
Fortunately I have not brought Idéfix.

12:49.087 --> 12:51.046
O Druid, what do we do?

12:51.213 --> 12:53.713
I may be a funny tinker...

13:00.299 --> 13:01.800
A funny tinker?

13:06.802 --> 13:10.970
Prodigious! You realize
how fast they grow?

13:11.137 --> 13:13.389
How it grows usual speed?

13:15.931 --> 13:17.807
I have a new not funny.

13:25.726 --> 13:28.144
It may seem daunting.

13:33.647 --> 13:37.731
We must see the good, the motivation
remains intact. It's great!

13:45.360 --> 13:48.903
Nobody gives up. We must
congratulate ourselves.

13:57.781 --> 14:00.700
- Obelix, eat slowly!
- To do what?

14:00.866 --> 14:04.243
- Well, I still have a tassel.
- I Will Not! Obelix...

14:06.410 --> 14:10.620
Obelix! You're going to uproot
me that tree, immediately!

14:10.787 --> 14:13.454
Oh no! I can not do that to Idéfix.

14:15.706 --> 14:18.623
So if I understand you correctly,

14:18.790 --> 14:22.542
not only the site of the Estate
of the Gods does not advance,

14:22.709 --> 14:25.167
but the Romans did not want to live there.

14:25.334 --> 14:27.961
We face some reluctance.

14:28.128 --> 14:31.212
Our citizens are reluctant
to emigrate to Armorica.

14:31.379 --> 14:35.463
If we built the city near
Rome, they would be far less.

14:35.630 --> 14:37.756
Give me a solution incapable!

14:37.923 --> 14:40.632
Or you will end the arena with the lions!

14:40.799 --> 14:43.342
It will entertain citizens,
without taking them

14:43.509 --> 14:45.260
away from home.

14:46.677 --> 14:48.177
The arenas...

14:48.594 --> 14:51.262
That's a great idea, O Caesar!

14:59.557 --> 15:01.975
Ha, naughty! I'll gut you!

15:02.142 --> 15:04.392
Hercules! To me! Help!

15:05.143 --> 15:06.768
It's me, Hercules!

15:06.935 --> 15:08.811
You will pay, nasty Trojan!

15:08.978 --> 15:10.894
You're going to die like a cockroach!

15:11.061 --> 15:15.814
Apeldjus! It has to killings,
massacres, killings?

15:15.980 --> 15:17.856
But let him, he enjoys.

15:18.022 --> 15:21.399
It's crazy so violent!
Where does he get that?

15:33.529 --> 15:36.215
- Attempting a triple outlet?
- Double.

15:36.239 --> 15:39.156
And neck, by the
way, it is better?

15:39.198 --> 15:41.241
I have to avoid sudden movements.

15:42.283 --> 15:44.701
- Ready for the shot of Rattlesnake?
- Ready Now!

15:47.744 --> 15:50.327
I never liked the shot of rattlesnake.

15:50.745 --> 15:52.245
Well, sorry, old man!

15:54.288 --> 15:56.205
Do not rebuke you there three times.

15:58.123 --> 16:00.415
Pshaw here, an ad!

16:02.624 --> 16:05.834
We can no longer do a killing correctly.

16:06.001 --> 16:07.084
Tell me about it!

16:07.251 --> 16:09.335
Romain! Roman!

16:09.586 --> 16:10.836
You've had enough!

16:11.003 --> 16:15.005
Enough of the stinking
atmosphere of the town! Noise!

16:15.172 --> 16:17.714
Frenzy! Traffic!

16:17.881 --> 16:19.715
Well no, not really...

16:19.882 --> 16:23.633
Know a quiet gem awaits you. A new quote,

16:23.800 --> 16:26.885
in a green setting awaits you at least

16:27.051 --> 16:29.010
three weeks from the center of Rome.

16:29.177 --> 16:31.428
The divine Caesar offer tonight

16:31.595 --> 16:35.597
to one of you a
splendid apartment...

16:36.054 --> 16:37.930
Domain of the gods!

16:41.015 --> 16:43.850
Consult the unbendable
located at your feet!

16:44.017 --> 16:46.392
Oh! But it's beautiful!

16:46.559 --> 16:48.810
Yes... but it's in Brittany.

16:48.977 --> 16:49.977
Where is it?

16:50.019 --> 16:51.352
I dunno, but it's far.

16:51.519 --> 16:54.896
The big draw... begin!

17:11.236 --> 17:12.904
The lucky winner...

17:13.944 --> 17:14.944
is...

17:15.237 --> 17:19.448
the holder of the unbendable number...

17:21.281 --> 17:22.281
a couple of!

17:23.949 --> 17:26.617
But... it's you! Bah quickly down!

17:26.784 --> 17:29.035
I want to go to Brittany.

17:29.202 --> 17:30.827
You do not even know where it is.

17:30.994 --> 17:32.828
Who is the lucky number two?

17:32.995 --> 17:34.496
This is us! It's here!

17:34.662 --> 17:35.996
It is this person!

17:36.163 --> 17:37.830
We won what? A gladiator?

17:37.997 --> 17:40.040
Whether cheering loudly,

17:40.207 --> 17:43.749
as it descends into the arena!

17:44.249 --> 17:47.209
Oh! Looks like your father's beautiful!

17:47.667 --> 17:49.168
It looks like a Greek hero.

17:49.335 --> 17:50.503
Well Done!

17:50.877 --> 17:51.877
Well Done!

17:52.628 --> 17:55.171
Mouse! Number and wield your mouse!

17:58.214 --> 18:00.673
Uh... Um... This is where Armorica already?

18:00.839 --> 18:01.840
In Gaul.

18:02.007 --> 18:04.008
Oh yes? It's far anyway.

18:04.174 --> 18:06.509
And if I refuse to leave?

18:06.675 --> 18:08.802
You stay here and cowardly lions.

18:10.344 --> 18:14.553
I Do Not. It's true that a little
fresh air, it can only do good.

18:24.557 --> 18:25.642
Oh yes!

18:26.600 --> 18:31.144
Indeed, Roman architecture
is awfully impressive.

18:31.310 --> 18:33.561
So there is the lobby?

18:36.979 --> 18:39.648
We will stop spending and
you will return to Rome

18:39.814 --> 18:42.398
and explain that the fun is over.

18:42.565 --> 18:45.900
Never Before! You hear?
Caesar gave me a mission.

18:46.067 --> 18:47.776
And I will lead her to the end,

18:47.943 --> 18:51.110
even if I kill the slaves to the task.

18:53.070 --> 18:55.278
"To kill the slaves to the task?"

18:55.445 --> 18:57.822
This is what will happen.

18:57.988 --> 18:59.906
What can we do, Getafix?

19:00.073 --> 19:01.114
Think Through.

19:07.742 --> 19:10.576
I have an idea, but you're going to want.

19:11.702 --> 19:14.245
- A beating?
- That, that was my idea.

19:14.411 --> 19:16.871
To protect the slaves, I have a plan.

19:17.038 --> 19:18.913
It requires a beating, certainly,

19:19.080 --> 19:20.872
but... a little.

19:21.039 --> 19:24.249
A little beating? It is this?

19:25.250 --> 19:26.250
SHL FU MI!

19:26.875 --> 19:28.125
SHL FU MI!

19:30.835 --> 19:33.670
The camp slaves, please?

19:33.837 --> 19:35.504
Hello!

19:35.671 --> 19:39.172
You may not know I'm
in a good mood!

20:03.181 --> 20:04.807
Well, it must be there.

20:18.437 --> 20:22.731
Here is the magic potion that
gives superhuman strength. Gift!

20:22.898 --> 20:24.440
I would taste not before?

20:24.607 --> 20:25.607
No, not you!

20:25.732 --> 20:28.109
It'll just you mutiny

20:28.276 --> 20:29.818
and run. You are free.

20:30.317 --> 20:34.862
First I want to say thank you.
But is the leak a way out?

20:35.028 --> 20:36.904
- Pardon?
- You speak of leakage.

20:37.070 --> 20:40.155
But flight is it not...
I force the feature,

20:40.322 --> 20:42.155
another form of slavery?

20:42.322 --> 20:44.991
It is rather the beginning
of a form of freedom.

20:45.157 --> 20:47.491
Yet no escape oppression.

20:47.658 --> 20:49.617
There are matters to discuss.

20:49.784 --> 20:51.702
I offer just a potion.

20:51.869 --> 20:53.536
I return to the concept...

20:53.703 --> 20:56.161
You take your potion or are you a glue!

20:56.328 --> 20:58.079
Absolutely, absolutely.

21:06.791 --> 21:08.333
What has happened?

21:08.500 --> 21:11.751
A fine example of respect
for our Gallic neighbors.

21:13.586 --> 21:16.045
Oh no, you is not the time!

21:21.797 --> 21:22.797
Ouch...

21:30.926 --> 21:35.386
From now on, we will reach a balance
equal to that of the legionaries.

21:35.553 --> 21:39.053
We want to leave, two
meals a day... How?

21:39.138 --> 21:40.555
- Three.
- Oh yes! So Now,

21:40.722 --> 21:41.930
three meals a day.

21:42.097 --> 21:43.181
- That's it?
- I Do Not.

21:43.347 --> 21:45.807
When the first building of
the city will be built,

21:45.974 --> 21:47.725
we want to be freed.

21:47.892 --> 21:49.100
- Goodfellas?
- Free.

21:49.267 --> 21:50.517
Ah yes, yes. As a result,

21:50.684 --> 21:52.685
it requires each housing.

21:52.852 --> 21:55.810
That's the little extra...
Present!

21:57.562 --> 21:58.812
You're not going to accept?

21:58.979 --> 22:00.897
Though. It seems prudent.

22:01.063 --> 22:02.522
Bargain?

22:35.202 --> 22:37.162
Oh yes! Actually...

22:37.329 --> 22:41.330
Roman architecture is impressive!

22:41.496 --> 22:42.748
It's a good job!

22:42.914 --> 22:43.914
What you do there?

22:43.998 --> 22:46.665
Centurion, according to a rumor that,

22:46.832 --> 22:50.459
you will give the slaves
the same pay as us?

22:50.626 --> 22:53.126
You confirm it's salads?

22:54.752 --> 22:56.628
- This is mine!
- No, mine!

22:56.794 --> 22:57.794
- I Will Not!
- Yes!

23:19.429 --> 23:21.888
What are you doing? The magic potion,

23:22.055 --> 23:23.597
it was to run away.

23:23.764 --> 23:26.057
So we debated it. And condition

23:26.223 --> 23:30.059
of runaway slave does not
offer career prospects.

23:30.225 --> 23:32.392
What do you like more, by Toutatis?

23:32.559 --> 23:33.559
Simply become

23:33.644 --> 23:37.394
free Roman citizens. For that,
we have to finish the building.

23:38.729 --> 23:40.063
We will not let you

23:40.229 --> 23:42.855
destroy our forest. Away your men!

23:43.022 --> 23:45.523
We will return to destroy the site.

23:58.946 --> 24:02.322
- Everyone was served?
- Oul! I Will Not...

24:02.489 --> 24:04.656
A bit of silence for my speech.

24:04.822 --> 24:05.907
COME ON! LET'S GO!

24:06.073 --> 24:08.532
You do not even know about
who you need to type.

24:08.699 --> 24:10.742
- Who cares!
- As long as we tape!

24:10.909 --> 24:13.034
We must destroy a large building.

24:13.201 --> 24:16.078
You break everything that comes along.
It will be fine.

24:18.912 --> 24:19.912
Hold On...

24:23.997 --> 24:26.915
CHAAAAAARGEZ!

24:47.173 --> 24:48.966
Group 44, you follow me!

24:49.132 --> 24:50.132
And 43?

24:50.257 --> 24:51.759
The 43 is the entrance C.

24:53.218 --> 24:54.218
Civilians!

24:54.385 --> 24:58.261
Oh, a little animation
costume to make us wait!

24:58.428 --> 25:00.428
I would have preferred a snack.

25:01.096 --> 25:02.471
John Marcus!

25:04.639 --> 25:05.889
Come on, buddy.

25:10.141 --> 25:12.600
- We can break the big house?
- I Do Not.

25:12.767 --> 25:15.893
- Well, a column, anyway?
- I Do Not.

25:16.060 --> 25:18.853
- The little cart, at least?
- I Will Not!

25:19.020 --> 25:22.980
What for the Romans if
you can not type on it?

25:28.357 --> 25:31.316
Come on, kids! We went home.

25:41.862 --> 25:43.905
I need your title.

25:44.072 --> 25:46.406
But that's my title!

25:46.572 --> 25:48.115
It was given to us by Caesar.

25:48.281 --> 25:49.324
What do you need?

25:49.491 --> 25:51.158
Petirictus... Petiminus.

25:51.325 --> 25:53.826
Petiminus, I can not... Say!

25:53.993 --> 25:56.244
Stop fidgeting or you will not get away.

25:56.411 --> 25:58.661
It's long! It's long, by Vesta!

25:58.828 --> 26:00.453
The mosaic is a long time.

26:00.620 --> 26:02.162
This is not new.

26:05.998 --> 26:08.373
- Your mosaic has a problem.
- Pardon?

26:08.540 --> 26:11.958
- It is too big and not consolidated...
- This is the time?

26:12.125 --> 26:14.042
- She's perfect, Peticitrus.
- Petiminus.

26:14.209 --> 26:17.252
Petiminus. I can not accommodate you.
Thank you. Next!

26:17.419 --> 26:20.378
- It was weeks of travel.
- It's Caesar...

26:20.545 --> 26:23.671
Returns tomorrow with a
complete record. Next!

26:29.173 --> 26:30.757
Go file, I'm busy!

26:42.179 --> 26:45.222
Brittany lost with nowhere to go...

26:45.389 --> 26:47.432
If it falls on the Gallic barbarians?

26:47.597 --> 26:49.099
I Will Not! I hate fighting.

26:49.265 --> 26:51.266
Hercules will flatten you!

26:51.433 --> 26:54.976
Look, he raises his own column!

27:21.695 --> 27:23.904
I have the right to play with the dog?

27:24.822 --> 27:28.448
For sure. It is very good
to bring the sticks.

27:28.614 --> 27:30.323
Hein, Idéfix?

27:30.490 --> 27:34.409
I train to bring the standing
stones, but it's not that.

27:38.411 --> 27:40.453
Come on, Dogmatix, fetch!

27:42.579 --> 27:45.371
- Hercules!
- It was bad luck.

27:45.455 --> 27:47.914
- You said it.
- What is going to fall on us?

27:51.624 --> 27:52.958
Daddy! Mom!

27:53.125 --> 27:54.417
I found Hercules!

27:54.584 --> 27:55.667
Where it Hercules?

27:56.710 --> 27:59.210
- Apeldjus!
- Saving children. Regions that

27:59.377 --> 28:00.462
man to man.

28:05.005 --> 28:06.881
I got you!

28:07.048 --> 28:08.048
About what?

28:08.214 --> 28:10.382
In a general way. You are...

28:10.549 --> 28:12.175
Say, the soup is getting cold!

28:12.341 --> 28:14.092
One minute Mimine. I arrive.

28:14.258 --> 28:17.676
You are very disappointed
to have had a good fight.

28:17.843 --> 28:19.969
We took the magic potion for nothing.

28:22.054 --> 28:23.971
If I meet a Roman civil,

28:24.138 --> 28:26.638
I shall send her a look
that will speak volumes!

28:26.930 --> 28:29.681
Me, if a Roman civil wonder his way,

28:29.848 --> 28:32.558
I will show him, but he will ask no more.

28:32.725 --> 28:33.725
Me, me!

28:33.892 --> 28:37.477
If a Roman helps me carry my
cart, I will say thank you...

28:37.643 --> 28:39.019
but it will not be sincere.

28:43.729 --> 28:45.938
It's buddies... They have nowhere to go.

28:46.105 --> 28:49.023
They do not have the correct folder.

28:49.523 --> 28:52.775
The last time a Roman came, I was not born.

28:52.941 --> 28:56.609
Civilian or not, Romans to
the village, I disagree.

28:56.776 --> 29:00.611
It's starting to look like
a small invasion attempt.

29:00.778 --> 29:03.154
Watch Out! The invaders are...

29:03.321 --> 29:04.488
Where did you see

29:04.654 --> 29:07.447
invaders? This is a lost family.

29:07.614 --> 29:10.323
But... Mimine - A family is a family.

29:10.490 --> 29:13.657
The small to be starved to death.
That's all I see.

29:13.824 --> 29:16.743
Come eat. There lukewarm soup.

29:17.159 --> 29:20.619
Do not worry about these big fools.
Come sit.

29:29.289 --> 29:31.040
Asterix village warrior.

29:31.207 --> 29:32.540
Petiminus, mosaic.

29:32.707 --> 29:35.501
I do not house you home, I had problems.

29:35.666 --> 29:36.918
Blame the glans.

29:37.085 --> 29:39.168
Obelix find you a solution.

29:46.296 --> 29:47.713
So, what do we do?

29:47.880 --> 29:48.881
About what?

29:49.048 --> 29:52.549
Domaine des Dieux, to the
fact that not hit civilians.

29:52.715 --> 29:54.716
Meanwhile, work continues.

29:54.883 --> 29:56.842
And it will get more.

29:57.009 --> 30:00.677
We must find a way to get rid of civil...

30:00.844 --> 30:02.345
without typing it!

30:08.180 --> 30:11.598
- This is the time, we go!
- Obelix!

30:21.520 --> 30:25.437
And I raise my horn to the health of
residents of the Estate of the Gods!

30:28.480 --> 30:31.815
Ah, finally! The famous Armorican rain!

30:31.981 --> 30:34.650
And that at Rome, they stifle heat!

30:44.362 --> 30:45.445
- Ave!
- Hi!

30:45.612 --> 30:46.612
Hi!

30:48.572 --> 30:52.365
- It is my fresh fish!
- You sell the how,

30:52.532 --> 30:54.157
Your mackerel there?

30:54.449 --> 30:55.699
Uh... a sesterce.

30:55.866 --> 30:57.867
A sesterce! In Rome, he is five.

30:58.034 --> 30:59.743
- And it's not fresh.
- Five!

30:59.910 --> 31:02.786
Oh, no, no... We, here is uh... a.

31:02.953 --> 31:05.745
Maybe because it was beside the sea...

31:05.912 --> 31:07.579
In Rome, too, right?

31:07.746 --> 31:09.330
In Rome, the sea is dirty.

31:09.497 --> 31:10.497
I'll take three.

31:10.540 --> 31:11.623
Yup!

31:17.209 --> 31:18.459
Exclamation of anger.

31:18.626 --> 31:19.751
You're proud of yourself?

31:19.918 --> 31:23.378
What? I should refuse
to sell to the Romans?

31:23.545 --> 31:28.171
If you were in Rome, you would sell
these fish five sesterces room!

31:28.505 --> 31:32.423
If you were in Rome, you empesterais
a little less, especially.

31:35.424 --> 31:37.384
- Incomplete file.
- Next!

31:44.303 --> 31:47.555
- What is happening?
- I do not know, you see nothing.

31:47.930 --> 31:50.013
- You know what happens?
- No, we see nothing.

31:52.807 --> 31:55.015
We will try to sleep anyway.

31:55.182 --> 31:57.225
It will never be worse than Rome.

31:58.517 --> 32:01.686
And there, at least, there
was the rain that refreshes.

32:02.727 --> 32:03.894
- Ave!
- Hi!

32:04.061 --> 32:05.061
Hi!

32:05.603 --> 32:08.938
Come on, hurry! The ladies
of the Estate of the Gods!

32:09.105 --> 32:11.439
Four sesterces mackerel! Cheaper than Rome!

32:12.606 --> 32:15.150
Oh! This trinket is delightful!

32:15.316 --> 32:18.568
Watch Out! It is not
the trinket everyone.

32:18.734 --> 32:22.027
It is a shield that
belonged to Vercingetorix.

32:22.193 --> 32:23.403
Say! Te in factories

32:23.570 --> 32:26.529
how much stuff that
belonged to Vercingetorix?

32:26.696 --> 32:29.738
If you were going to fish?
This mummified your fish!

32:31.656 --> 32:33.157
Incomplete applications!

32:33.782 --> 32:35.074
Next!

32:42.702 --> 32:44.619
You know what happens?

32:44.786 --> 32:46.912
No, we see nothing!

32:47.079 --> 32:49.371
We will try to sleep anyway!

32:49.538 --> 32:52.081
It can never be worse than Rome!

32:52.582 --> 32:54.707
There at least, rain is refreshing.

32:56.499 --> 32:57.625
- Ave!
- Hi!

33:02.960 --> 33:03.960
It costs how much?

33:04.003 --> 33:06.795
Special Price Domaine des
Dieux: 40 sesterces.

33:06.962 --> 33:10.755
If it had belonged to
Vercingetorix, he would triple!

33:10.922 --> 33:15.799
First, I do what I want.
Deuzio is how the triple 40?

33:15.966 --> 33:17.133
It's 120 sesterces.

33:17.758 --> 33:19.176
At that price, I buy.

33:19.467 --> 33:20.509
That's too much!

33:20.676 --> 33:23.635
Say your fish belonged to Vercingetorix.

33:23.802 --> 33:25.636
Given the smell, it not shock!

33:27.596 --> 33:32.347
Oh look! It is picturesque! Well Done!

33:32.514 --> 33:33.556
Next!

33:39.017 --> 33:40.101
We got it!

33:40.642 --> 33:43.144
We got it! We got it! We got it!

33:43.311 --> 33:46.812
- We got it! We got it! We got it!
- We got it!

33:56.232 --> 33:58.233
Hello! Hello!

33:58.400 --> 33:59.400
Hello!

34:00.026 --> 34:01.026
Hello!

34:01.109 --> 34:02.484
Hola, qué tal?

34:02.651 --> 34:04.360
Hat, hat, guys!

34:04.527 --> 34:07.362
Impressive, Anglaigus! Very impressive!

34:07.528 --> 34:09.155
And all this in time!

34:09.321 --> 34:11.572
But it was not without difficulty, senator.

34:11.739 --> 34:13.864
There he is proud. There are eight days

34:14.032 --> 34:15.782
he held his pants with both hands.

34:15.949 --> 34:17.741
- Well, it is!
- Centurion!

34:17.908 --> 34:19.201
No, no, later.

34:19.367 --> 34:20.993
Your senator will be gone.

34:21.159 --> 34:22.284
What is it?

34:22.452 --> 34:25.661
I promised to free them,
but I have no authority.

34:25.828 --> 34:27.454
You have promised that?

34:27.621 --> 34:31.039
And he paid them. And he gave them housing.

34:31.206 --> 34:33.748
- What?
- Without that, we fought.

34:34.956 --> 34:35.956
Let me do it.

34:39.833 --> 34:40.918
Slaves!

34:41.210 --> 34:43.168
By the powers conferred me

34:43.335 --> 34:44.668
Caesar, the Roman people

34:44.835 --> 34:47.212
and fuss, me, Senator Gaius Prospectus,

34:47.378 --> 34:49.129
hop, snitch, I freed you.

34:49.295 --> 34:51.380
- We are free?
- There You Go...

34:51.547 --> 34:55.049
Pshaw, hey that, I can
tell you that it's nice.

34:55.215 --> 34:58.925
Do not forget to check out of your homes.

34:59.091 --> 35:02.593
We understood that we were awarded.

35:02.760 --> 35:06.261
When you were slaves. Now you have to pay

35:06.428 --> 35:08.471
15 sesterces rent per week.

35:08.638 --> 35:10.305
15 sesterces! Anyway!

35:10.471 --> 35:11.722
But good news!

35:11.889 --> 35:15.182
Construction workers positions
come to break free.

35:15.349 --> 35:18.784
- The salary is 15 sesterces per week.
- You accept?

35:18.808 --> 35:21.017
Well, the proposal...
Pitch Perfect!

35:21.184 --> 35:22.517
You are incurred.

35:22.684 --> 35:25.894
Uh... Anglaigus, your
workers are not at work.

35:26.561 --> 35:28.771
The nerve, lazy band!

35:28.938 --> 35:31.480
We pay you what, exactly? Come on, hop!

35:31.647 --> 35:34.189
- To the site!
- The whip cracks. And trot!

35:34.356 --> 35:35.565
But it is slavery!

35:38.358 --> 35:40.734
That it must be admitted,
you are efficient!

35:40.901 --> 35:43.735
I Will Not... I am Senator!

35:46.486 --> 35:48.987
They are new, my antiques!

35:49.154 --> 35:53.030
For junk, contact the expert!
Father to son

35:53.197 --> 35:55.240
since Vercingetorix!

35:55.406 --> 35:56.823
September sesterces mackerel!

35:56.990 --> 35:59.450
6.99 sesterces mackerel! 6.99!

36:02.284 --> 36:05.160
Three mackerel offered for
three mackerel purchased!

36:05.327 --> 36:07.328
It's been six mackerel at a price of...

36:07.495 --> 36:10.371
I tell you that this
shield is not for sale!

36:10.537 --> 36:12.205
Even for 450 sesterces?

36:12.372 --> 36:14.790
That's offer? I packed you.

36:15.373 --> 36:17.874
As usual, lemons are available.

36:18.041 --> 36:19.375
Thank you.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.459
You will give us two fish.

36:22.626 --> 36:24.752
You eat fish now?

36:24.919 --> 36:28.795
Obliged. There are over a boar
in the forest with this mess.

36:29.671 --> 36:31.171
That will make 14 sesterces.

36:31.338 --> 36:32.838
What? This is a joke?

36:33.005 --> 36:35.298
It breaks my heart to raise prices,

36:35.464 --> 36:37.799
but it is hardly more
expensive than in Rome.

36:37.966 --> 36:40.342
Is theft! Drop your price!

36:40.508 --> 36:45.010
Why? Even at seven, my fish
is sold as small antiques.

36:45.177 --> 36:47.594
I take one!

36:47.761 --> 36:50.179
- Mackerel for two?
- Exactly.

36:56.098 --> 36:59.557
Fish is left? There was nothing to eat.

36:59.724 --> 37:01.517
That does not concern me...

37:09.187 --> 37:11.646
You all have become crazy!

37:11.813 --> 37:14.563
Mr. Asterix prevents us
from typing civilians.

37:14.730 --> 37:17.524
And when we welcome them,
he wants us to return.

37:17.691 --> 37:20.733
You are ridiculous with your
mackerel seven sesterces.

37:20.900 --> 37:22.693
Stop this circus and help us!

37:22.859 --> 37:24.318
Help you what?

37:24.485 --> 37:29.195
To do that the Romans leave and we
can shave the area of ​​the Gods.

37:29.362 --> 37:30.445
WHAT?

37:30.612 --> 37:31.946
To demolish the city,

37:32.113 --> 37:33.989
it must first be emptied.

37:34.155 --> 37:35.155
And customers?

37:35.281 --> 37:37.907
For antiques, the Romans are the future.

37:38.074 --> 37:41.242
There is no harm in grow trade.

37:41.409 --> 37:44.743
Evil is that you have become greedy fools.

37:44.910 --> 37:47.577
This is wrong! We had been fools.

37:47.744 --> 37:51.121
And we are not greedy, no
one knows what it means.

37:52.788 --> 37:56.748
- Do not worry, I do not bore you anymore.
- Verry good.

37:56.914 --> 37:59.916
- I am moving to Domaine des Dieux!
- QUOl?

38:00.083 --> 38:02.083
- I do too.
- I do too.

38:02.250 --> 38:06.168
I will not stay in a town
that I do not recognize.

38:11.629 --> 38:16.548
I abuse, but would not this the
perfect time for a farewell song?

38:20.675 --> 38:22.800
Since that's it, I'm leaving too.

38:22.967 --> 38:26.427
The Romans will welcome an artist.
And I tell you...

38:26.593 --> 38:27.719
Assurancetourix!

38:27.885 --> 38:29.636
If you come, it is now.

38:29.970 --> 38:31.679
In short, I am outraged!

38:47.602 --> 38:48.936
We want housing.

38:49.103 --> 38:51.979
Leave the area without fuss.

38:52.354 --> 38:54.564
We do not make a fuss.

38:54.730 --> 38:57.315
But... it's impossible... Hello!

38:57.481 --> 38:59.815
Hello! Hello!

38:59.982 --> 39:05.609
Hello! Welcome! We will be happy...
What?

39:08.319 --> 39:10.778
You're even dumber than you seem.

39:10.945 --> 39:13.779
We do not host Gauls. What will Caesar?

39:16.489 --> 39:19.032
The Gauls want to live like the Romans.

39:19.198 --> 39:22.908
- Huh?
- The crazy desert their village.

39:23.075 --> 39:24.284
What will Caesar

39:24.451 --> 39:27.994
if he sees that his plan runs
1000 times better than expected?

39:28.161 --> 39:29.661
I have more free housing.

39:29.828 --> 39:31.495
Make room!

39:31.662 --> 39:33.413
No problem!

39:33.705 --> 39:35.164
We will fix you up.

39:37.581 --> 39:38.623
Hercules arrives!

39:38.790 --> 39:40.832
Phew! All Done!

39:40.999 --> 39:42.624
We finally home!

39:42.791 --> 39:43.792
Look! Look!

39:43.958 --> 39:45.626
Come In!

39:58.673 --> 39:59.965
Now what?

40:00.132 --> 40:01.507
You have an idea, Asterix?

40:01.883 --> 40:04.009
I need to notify the night.

40:05.301 --> 40:08.969
It's weird that house. It looks like a box.

40:09.136 --> 40:11.012
It is an apartment, Obelix.

40:11.428 --> 40:14.180
If we knew which box was Apeldjus,

40:14.347 --> 40:16.472
we'd gone to say hello.

40:26.601 --> 40:27.769
Beautiful!

40:29.269 --> 40:30.770
Beautiful!

40:30.936 --> 40:33.104
The poison is working.

40:33.437 --> 40:35.813
We must strike! Tell,

40:35.980 --> 40:39.023
in Brittany, the inhabitants
of the rebel town

40:39.190 --> 40:40.690
have a right to housing.

40:40.857 --> 40:42.649
Domaine des Dieux!

40:43.317 --> 40:44.734
Free for life!

41:12.037 --> 41:17.373
"A beautiful free accommodation
awaits each family of Gallic village."

41:17.538 --> 41:20.082
"Domaine des Dieux!"

41:20.248 --> 41:22.083
Free housing?

41:22.249 --> 41:25.958
If it allows me to see your heads, I go on.

41:26.125 --> 41:28.293
You waiting for? You want some momentum?

41:28.460 --> 41:32.504
Civilization would do me good!
Your fish and trinkets...

41:32.670 --> 41:35.922
I am head of the village, Mimine.
We can not go.

41:36.088 --> 41:37.672
I did not say that I will go with you.

41:37.838 --> 41:40.298
Is not holding you. Will
make your head there!

41:40.465 --> 41:41.465
Who said that?

41:41.507 --> 41:43.091
Go all the Romans!

41:43.257 --> 41:45.634
It will do less charlatans on the market!

41:46.926 --> 41:49.344
Same for the fish. Place the professionals!

41:49.511 --> 41:50.511
He is tired there.

41:50.594 --> 41:52.428
- Of swindlers!
- Who is swindler?

41:52.595 --> 41:53.678
It is you who say that!

41:53.845 --> 41:55.805
Listen trinkets dealer!

41:55.971 --> 41:57.972
The poisoner, you no better!

42:07.810 --> 42:08.976
What do I do now?

42:09.143 --> 42:10.143
I am going?

42:10.185 --> 42:11.269
Yes We Do! Go ahead!

42:11.436 --> 42:14.813
It is better to start with a light song?

42:14.979 --> 42:15.979
As intro?

42:16.021 --> 42:20.190
No no! Attack directly
with something powerful!

42:20.356 --> 42:23.982
It's a new audience, it
must make an impression!

42:24.149 --> 42:26.401
Well... Go to powerful...

43:18.130 --> 43:19.130
More...

43:19.172 --> 43:21.506
- What are you doing here?
- After deliberation,

43:21.673 --> 43:25.341
we decided to approach
our beloved customers.

43:25.508 --> 43:29.635
As such, we discourage
all welcome song.

43:29.802 --> 43:33.386
The projectile used is
a pimp seven sesterces

43:33.553 --> 43:35.262
of the highest quality.

43:35.762 --> 43:37.596
Come on, kids! Let's go!

43:41.306 --> 43:43.266
They are crazy these Gauls!

43:43.682 --> 43:45.975
I feel that it calmed down.

43:46.142 --> 43:48.017
You can go up the luggage.

44:03.399 --> 44:04.607
Obelix!

44:04.774 --> 44:05.858
You're there, you?

44:08.901 --> 44:10.652
We're sorry, but...

44:10.818 --> 44:12.236
we did not know where to go.

44:12.403 --> 44:13.653
You did well.

44:41.747 --> 44:43.498
Preparing his dozen!

44:58.921 --> 45:01.256
Forward!

45:01.423 --> 45:03.465
Oh! More...

45:11.594 --> 45:13.428
A beautiful representation

45:13.594 --> 45:15.179
architect at work.

45:28.517 --> 45:29.517
Ave!

46:14.661 --> 46:16.870
We go to the next building.

46:17.037 --> 46:18.245
We remain grouped.

46:21.039 --> 46:22.206
Grouped!

46:24.874 --> 46:28.374
Steer everything! To the left!

46:28.541 --> 46:31.251
More to the left! The other left!

46:45.299 --> 46:46.341
I'm hungry!

47:00.055 --> 47:01.430
What was I saying?

47:01.597 --> 47:03.598
- When?
- There, right there!

47:03.765 --> 47:06.182
You laugh diabolical way.

47:06.349 --> 47:08.683
Evil rather... No, but before!

47:08.850 --> 47:11.893
Oh... before we too must ask.

47:12.060 --> 47:13.268
You said "finally".

47:13.435 --> 47:14.477
Ah yes, "Finally!"

47:14.644 --> 47:16.978
Finally, I want these irreducible!

47:17.145 --> 47:20.939
After years of humiliation, four
buildings and a few matrons

47:21.104 --> 47:22.356
have come to the end.

47:22.523 --> 47:25.857
O Caesar! Our victory
over Gaul is complete!

47:26.024 --> 47:27.899
I Will Not! It will total

47:28.066 --> 47:32.026
that when no longer remain a log
of their ridiculous village.

47:32.193 --> 47:33.235
Ouch!

47:35.528 --> 47:37.570
Change of plans!

47:37.737 --> 47:40.821
There is a village shaving!

47:43.822 --> 47:45.198
It is diabolical that?

47:45.365 --> 47:47.032
No, evil.

47:53.910 --> 47:55.118
There!

47:58.870 --> 48:00.162
- Have you seen one?
- I Do Not.

48:00.329 --> 48:01.664
Why you turn?

48:01.829 --> 48:03.914
To change the corner. There was nothing.

48:04.081 --> 48:06.290
There! There! There!

48:09.375 --> 48:10.833
Ah! Watch Out!

48:13.377 --> 48:15.669
- So?
- No, still no boar.

48:15.835 --> 48:18.295
They all left because of work.

48:18.462 --> 48:20.504
There remains perhaps one or two.

48:38.762 --> 48:39.845
Ben then?

48:40.012 --> 48:42.430
I'm a little tired suddenly.

48:42.596 --> 48:44.556
I rest five minutes.

48:44.722 --> 48:45.722
I feel bad.

48:45.765 --> 48:47.932
- That's because you got hungry.
- You think?

48:48.099 --> 48:49.808
It's not you do that when you stay.

48:49.975 --> 48:53.309
- Without eating?
- I still never long without eating.

48:53.476 --> 48:56.769
Do not worry. I'll find you a boar.

48:56.936 --> 48:58.436
Do not move, I return.

48:58.603 --> 49:00.729
You're not too far away, right?

49:02.980 --> 49:04.481
Apeldjus!

49:12.150 --> 49:13.234
Idéfix!

49:22.738 --> 49:24.948
LOAD!

49:27.949 --> 49:30.408
Well? What are you doing?

49:30.575 --> 49:33.993
One card that has just
passed the general strike.

49:34.159 --> 49:36.286
- Unanimously!
- What?

49:36.452 --> 49:38.911
We believe this dangerous assault.

49:39.078 --> 49:41.788
Obviously, this is an assault.
It shaves a village.

49:41.955 --> 49:46.164
We have said repeatedly:
War, yes, drudgery, no!

49:46.331 --> 49:48.666
We demand guarantees.

49:48.832 --> 49:50.916
The druid must be neutralized,

49:51.083 --> 49:54.334
for the Gauls no longer
have the magic potion.

49:54.501 --> 49:55.710
This is a joke?

49:55.876 --> 49:58.878
We would also like to mention the courtesy.

49:59.044 --> 50:02.546
Ineligible your...
Is unacceptable.

50:13.634 --> 50:14.676
Soldiers want...

50:14.843 --> 50:17.636
Destroy the village. I know, I heard.

50:17.802 --> 50:19.262
"Shave the village."

50:19.428 --> 50:22.138
The exact wording of the
order coming from Rome,

50:22.305 --> 50:24.222
is "razing the village."

50:24.389 --> 50:25.431
Seize them!

50:25.598 --> 50:27.098
But there is nothing settled.

50:27.265 --> 50:29.141
What? It is your druid.

50:29.308 --> 50:32.475
You speak and it is there.
What do you want?

50:32.642 --> 50:35.727
It remains the question
of free housing.

50:35.893 --> 50:39.312
And what you think courtesy.

50:39.478 --> 50:42.146
Stop them by Juno!

50:43.313 --> 50:46.398
This is not about that tone
that things will get better...

50:49.274 --> 50:52.442
O! O! O Caesar!

50:52.609 --> 50:56.777
No building will rise high enough...
quite high...

50:56.943 --> 50:58.486
to match... Huh?

50:58.652 --> 51:02.696
No but... You laugh?
What am I doing that?

51:02.863 --> 51:05.697
You have not built a prison, then...

51:05.864 --> 51:08.574
I will not stand in my hall of honor.

51:08.740 --> 51:11.617
Was ordered to put them inside prisoners

51:11.783 --> 51:13.867
not for the Gauls see them.

51:14.034 --> 51:18.328
This is nonsense! A main hall with a cage.

51:19.077 --> 51:21.412
Soldiers snore.

51:21.579 --> 51:24.872
Quite high... No, quite high!

51:25.039 --> 51:26.414
Quite high!

51:34.126 --> 51:37.377
Do not worry, Apeldjus.
Someone will help us.

51:37.544 --> 51:40.503
I care not. Obelix will break everything.

51:40.670 --> 51:42.421
Find a way to prevent...

51:44.047 --> 51:45.213
I know!

51:46.839 --> 51:49.132
Accepts that modest banquet in...

51:49.299 --> 51:51.841
testimony... testimony...

51:52.008 --> 51:54.384
Hey there! No horseplay!

51:54.717 --> 51:56.010
Evidence of what?

51:57.719 --> 51:59.011
Hercules...

51:59.428 --> 52:00.928
Testimony...

52:03.512 --> 52:08.015
- As testimony to you.
- Yes We Do!

52:08.181 --> 52:11.807
You're even smarter than
I thought, Apeldjus.

52:20.770 --> 52:24.480
I will not get all that
you stay at Domaine Gods.

52:24.647 --> 52:26.105
You housed the slaves.

52:26.272 --> 52:28.731
- It would repatriate our families.
- What?

52:28.898 --> 52:30.815
I have not seen my wife for 22 years.

52:30.982 --> 52:33.567
Me she was pregnant and I'm a grandfather.

52:33.733 --> 52:36.193
Family reunification, centurion!

52:45.155 --> 52:46.155
Apeldjus?

52:46.238 --> 52:50.491
By Toutatis, I'm so hungry! Apeldjus?

52:50.657 --> 52:51.908
Apeldjus!

52:52.407 --> 52:53.533
Apeldjus!

52:57.868 --> 53:00.119
Apeldjus? Apeldjus?

53:00.745 --> 53:01.745
Panoramix!

53:01.870 --> 53:04.913
Petiminus! Asterix! Look!

53:07.081 --> 53:08.915
He had to get her something.

53:09.082 --> 53:13.416
Apeldjus no risk. He is with Ob...
Obelix?

53:13.833 --> 53:16.793
You are with Apeldjus? He returned?

53:16.959 --> 53:19.169
Not since the river! Let's go!

53:19.336 --> 53:21.252
Obelix, keeps the village!

53:21.419 --> 53:23.962
I'm coming! Wait for me! Wait for me!

53:25.463 --> 53:26.713
Obelix!

53:27.089 --> 53:28.589
Obelix!

53:47.639 --> 53:51.015
A legion does not live
in a luxury property,

53:51.182 --> 53:53.225
touching 22 as a day.

53:53.392 --> 53:54.725
I earn 10 per week.

53:54.892 --> 53:56.518
Am making your rights.

53:56.685 --> 53:57.810
And the big, centurion?

53:57.976 --> 53:59.560
What a big centurion?

53:59.727 --> 54:01.770
I Do Not. And the big... centurion?

54:01.937 --> 54:03.270
But how big?

54:03.437 --> 54:06.772
The big Gauls superhuman strength.
He remains at large.

54:06.939 --> 54:08.064
We will not repeat

54:08.231 --> 54:10.273
if the work is not neutralized.

54:10.440 --> 54:13.441
And how I can
neutralize since...

54:17.193 --> 54:19.151
These are not our business!

54:19.318 --> 54:21.653
Just Listen... I'm hungry...

54:28.114 --> 54:29.489
Stop, centurion!

54:29.656 --> 54:30.948
You'll wake him.

54:32.408 --> 54:34.991
Accept this modest meal...

54:35.158 --> 54:36.409
No, this modest banquet...

54:37.867 --> 54:41.036
You will take me all the prisoners?

54:41.202 --> 54:44.121
Hush! Slowly, architect. You'll wake him.

54:44.287 --> 54:46.955
Order was to conceal that one of the Gauls.

54:47.122 --> 54:49.622
By the gods! They had Obelix!

54:49.789 --> 54:51.998
As for the other two near the mosaic.

54:52.165 --> 54:53.708
Your mosaic is damn bad!

54:53.874 --> 54:55.667
- The farm!
- My dad said it!

54:55.834 --> 54:59.293
Silence! He must quickly
seal it in a safe place.

54:59.460 --> 55:00.627
And silent!

56:00.068 --> 56:03.111
We followed the river
and found no Apeldjus!

56:03.278 --> 56:06.279
We had to... pass... without notice.

56:07.405 --> 56:08.613
Hey!

56:08.780 --> 56:09.780
Now what?

56:09.864 --> 56:12.198
The same thing the other way!

56:12.365 --> 56:13.365
Quick!

56:14.991 --> 56:17.492
Dulcia! Hold On!

56:22.411 --> 56:26.037
I hope they have not made us
get up early for nothing.

56:26.204 --> 56:27.705
To visit the dolmens,

56:27.872 --> 56:28.997
it was not that early.

56:29.164 --> 56:31.331
It gathers around me!

56:31.498 --> 56:33.665
I hope we will have a snack.

56:33.832 --> 56:35.291
It has water, it's something.

56:35.458 --> 56:36.750
Please, listen to me.

56:36.916 --> 56:41.252
We have the unique opportunity
this morning to be able to attend

56:41.419 --> 56:43.544
a ra-ri-ssime event.

57:03.553 --> 57:07.138
Loading... Please!

57:11.639 --> 57:14.348
Archers at my command,

57:14.515 --> 57:17.184
be kind enough to draw!

57:34.565 --> 57:36.357
But do something!

57:36.524 --> 57:37.524
What do I do?

57:37.609 --> 57:39.567
I dunno. Go see the centurion!

57:39.734 --> 57:40.734
What centurion?

58:25.836 --> 58:28.338
Be kind to attack me minus!

58:28.671 --> 58:31.005
- What?
- I said "be nice."

58:31.172 --> 58:33.548
If the enemy has the potion, no fighting.

58:33.715 --> 58:36.090
That's why we shut the druid.

58:36.257 --> 58:37.508
Domaine Gods.

58:37.674 --> 58:39.467
- What druid?
- Ours?

58:39.634 --> 58:40.634
And the big, too.

58:40.675 --> 58:41.675
How big?

58:41.718 --> 58:42.718
Ours?

58:42.802 --> 58:45.345
It's not strawberry juice he drank!

58:45.512 --> 58:48.387
Not be fooled, it's flan!

58:48.554 --> 58:50.180
The blank? In a gourd?

58:50.347 --> 58:51.931
One is where there centurion?

58:52.097 --> 58:55.097
We turkey stuffing or what?

58:55.224 --> 58:57.016
Well... I get it, I get down.

58:59.059 --> 59:01.434
After a moment...

59:01.601 --> 59:04.394
COEST good cause, but you have to say...

59:04.560 --> 59:05.560
stop!

59:13.481 --> 59:15.816
So we superhuman strength?

59:15.982 --> 59:19.484
You want a slap? You tell me
if it's quite superhuman.

59:19.651 --> 59:21.943
Do not you ask the usual permission.

59:23.151 --> 59:27.028
My first slaps, I reserve
the Roman calendar.

59:27.195 --> 59:28.862
Those... in particular!

59:29.822 --> 59:32.781
You are proud of yourself
with your ridiculous clothes!

59:32.948 --> 59:34.406
"Civilian Roman"...

59:34.573 --> 59:38.574
You, O Abraracourcix our chef!
You have deserted your village.

59:38.741 --> 59:42.326
- What?
- I'll teach you to desert your village.

59:42.493 --> 59:43.868
That is to say?

59:44.035 --> 59:45.619
Admonishing you a slap

59:45.786 --> 59:48.412
powerful, thanks to the magic potion...

59:49.913 --> 59:52.497
I just drink. You are ready?

59:52.664 --> 59:53.664
Ready for what?

59:53.914 --> 59:55.873
To make a pie overkill

59:56.040 --> 59:59.041
will send you waltz at the
other end of the forest.

01:00:13.297 --> 01:00:17.258
By Toutatis, what power!
This can only be magic!

01:00:17.424 --> 01:00:18.591
And Yo!

01:00:18.758 --> 01:00:20.592
So much for your fish not fresh!

01:00:25.219 --> 01:00:27.262
By Bélénos! What hammering!

01:00:27.428 --> 01:00:29.804
So much for your antiques, pirate!

01:00:31.429 --> 01:00:32.429
Brittany O!

01:00:32.472 --> 01:00:35.974
Wet earth with blood, you avenge injustice.

01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:40.058
I want to love you again
and ringing the armistice.

01:00:44.185 --> 01:00:47.603
Hum, hum... So, they
have or not the potion?

01:00:47.770 --> 01:00:51.438
They have, they have not... With
all that, I'm destabilized.

01:00:51.604 --> 01:00:54.106
I have to go free Obelix and Getafix.

01:00:54.273 --> 01:00:56.107
Look after them while I'm off.

01:00:56.274 --> 01:00:58.482
Asterix, I'm so ashamed...

01:00:58.649 --> 01:01:00.358
We'll see that later.

01:01:05.485 --> 01:01:07.778
Friends! Our dear village is threatened.

01:01:07.945 --> 01:01:12.154
This is the time to drink a
generous swig of our magic potion!

01:01:12.321 --> 01:01:13.321
Do not worry too much.

01:01:13.447 --> 01:01:16.240
- I'm not too much!
- YUP!

01:01:20.284 --> 01:01:24.034
Centurion... in military
terms, what do we do?

01:01:24.201 --> 01:01:26.244
I do not know, I'm destabilized.

01:01:26.411 --> 01:01:27.995
We are in trouble.

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:44.835
Asterix! Quick! Apeldjus must be there,

01:01:45.002 --> 01:01:46.419
but closed.

01:01:46.586 --> 01:01:47.711
Why there?

01:01:47.878 --> 01:01:49.461
Because it can only be there.

01:01:49.628 --> 01:01:52.005
Open by Juno or I push the door!

01:01:52.171 --> 01:01:53.964
Apeldjus!

01:01:54.131 --> 01:01:56.007
The reception is closed by Vesta!

01:01:56.172 --> 01:01:57.299
Opens architect!

01:01:57.465 --> 01:01:59.300
- Asterix!
- Getafix!

01:01:59.465 --> 01:02:00.967
How many are there?

01:02:01.134 --> 01:02:03.217
Get out or I send the gard!

01:02:41.191 --> 01:02:43.067
Guards! Do you get them!

01:02:43.234 --> 01:02:44.234
It's up there!

01:02:44.318 --> 01:02:46.527
- Apeldjus!
- Free the prisoners!

01:03:12.163 --> 01:03:14.164
You're going to release them, saying!

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:20.499
When I tell you that the
mosaic has a defect...

01:03:20.917 --> 01:03:21.917
is that it has...

01:03:23.292 --> 01:03:24.293
a...

01:03:25.418 --> 01:03:26.418
from a...

01:03:27.586 --> 01:03:28.711
Need!

01:03:40.382 --> 01:03:41.466
Apeldjus!

01:03:42.717 --> 01:03:43.717
You know what?

01:03:50.929 --> 01:03:52.596
And that one, did not you fly.

01:03:53.387 --> 01:03:54.513
Daddy!

01:03:58.307 --> 01:04:02.600
What have you done Obelix architect?
By The!

01:04:02.767 --> 01:04:04.976
We do not have time to look for it.

01:04:05.143 --> 01:04:06.893
We need to make the magic potion

01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:09.019
and I need everyone.

01:04:09.436 --> 01:04:10.436
Ouch!

01:04:15.813 --> 01:04:19.357
You know? I was shut out.
You had forgotten me?

01:04:31.695 --> 01:04:34.030
It's been an hour since it discutaille!

01:04:34.196 --> 01:04:35.489
You attack or not?

01:04:35.656 --> 01:04:39.115
If folds, you'll sue us or not?

01:04:39.281 --> 01:04:40.324
Y is likely.

01:04:41.449 --> 01:04:42.616
Well, we revote.

01:04:42.908 --> 01:04:44.325
That is for the downturn?

01:04:45.493 --> 01:04:47.077
Who is to attack?

01:04:50.536 --> 01:04:51.536
So downturn.

01:04:51.578 --> 01:04:53.120
Oh no...

01:05:03.375 --> 01:05:05.417
- Children! We follow!
- YUP!

01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:22.758
- My salt is called "back"!
- A dog took my grass!

01:05:22.925 --> 01:05:24.884
Mackerel seven sesterces!

01:05:37.222 --> 01:05:39.390
That is good. That I do not need it.

01:05:39.556 --> 01:05:41.516
That... oh yes! That yes!

01:05:41.683 --> 01:05:43.517
It... what is it?

01:05:45.809 --> 01:05:48.060
Quick, Getafix! Quick!

01:06:10.069 --> 01:06:13.779
You do not refugees you in
your apartment, centurion?

01:06:14.445 --> 01:06:17.155
I have not. You've all taken.

01:06:32.954 --> 01:06:34.621
Why they are out of breath?

01:06:34.787 --> 01:06:38.163
Usually... We never
had time to flee.

01:06:38.330 --> 01:06:39.373
Say.

01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:43.874
What do you need more to admit that
they have not the potion, a sign?

01:06:48.085 --> 01:06:50.836
Come on, kids... is loaded...

01:07:28.351 --> 01:07:30.435
What's that this project?

01:07:47.568 --> 01:07:49.110
Where is he?

01:07:49.277 --> 01:07:51.028
He is here! Ah, my Caesar!

01:07:51.193 --> 01:07:54.070
No building will rise high enough

01:07:54.237 --> 01:07:58.113
to match the size Caesar!

01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:02.365
Accepts that modest banquet...
a witness...

01:08:02.532 --> 01:08:04.158
- u are welcome.
- I have not found.

01:08:04.324 --> 01:08:07.451
Do you imagine that I came to Rome to eat?

01:08:07.617 --> 01:08:09.785
Not even a little tart?

01:08:09.951 --> 01:08:13.494
Here's one, tart! Removes all that grub!

01:08:13.661 --> 01:08:14.661
And faster than that!

01:08:25.082 --> 01:08:28.502
Hop, hop, hop! When
Caesar says "thrown"...

01:08:28.527 --> 01:08:29.692
discarded.

01:08:29.835 --> 01:08:31.335
Yeah, that's not true.

01:08:44.174 --> 01:08:45.716
Stop all this world!

01:08:51.093 --> 01:08:52.093
Getafix, quick!

01:08:52.551 --> 01:08:54.094
Almost, almost...

01:09:03.015 --> 01:09:04.099
Asterix!

01:09:04.265 --> 01:09:06.099
I Will Not! The potion is not ready!

01:09:06.265 --> 01:09:08.350
The potion is not ready!

01:09:26.399 --> 01:09:27.442
Panoramix!

01:09:56.245 --> 01:09:59.955
You lost, Gauls! This
time, Rome was stronger.

01:10:00.122 --> 01:10:02.414
Your people. Admit it!

01:10:03.207 --> 01:10:04.332
And subject yourself!

01:10:05.041 --> 01:10:08.042
I will never submit to me.

01:10:08.209 --> 01:10:12.585
I am... Asterix the Gallic warrior...

01:10:13.002 --> 01:10:16.420
I was assured that the Gauls became Roman.

01:10:17.129 --> 01:10:19.171
But, they are! They are!

01:10:19.338 --> 01:10:20.713
O Caesar!

01:10:21.005 --> 01:10:24.757
Take A Look! Your victory is complete!
Contemplate

01:10:24.924 --> 01:10:26.341
your prisoners!

01:10:26.508 --> 01:10:29.550
The civilization of wild mustaches...

01:10:29.926 --> 01:10:32.385
is finally eradicated! And that stupid

01:10:32.552 --> 01:10:34.719
little arrogant warrior

01:10:34.886 --> 01:10:37.845
will now join his accomplice big...

01:10:38.012 --> 01:10:39.097
the dungeon!

01:10:52.352 --> 01:10:54.019
Obelix!

01:10:54.186 --> 01:10:58.354
I'm not fat!

01:11:09.192 --> 01:11:10.901
Is loaded!

01:11:14.402 --> 01:11:16.737
- We load!
- ON CHARGE!

01:11:17.403 --> 01:11:19.029
Charge!

01:11:19.196 --> 01:11:20.738
Please!

01:11:24.490 --> 01:11:27.282
Obelix!

01:11:27.825 --> 01:11:30.284
Open! By order of Caesar open!

01:11:30.450 --> 01:11:33.244
What are they doing out there?
They come to help us?

01:11:38.954 --> 01:11:40.330
Yes, you could say that.

01:11:49.250 --> 01:11:53.627
Pull It... without
wishing you order!

01:12:01.630 --> 01:12:04.172
Kindly ti...

01:12:23.472 --> 01:12:25.098
The final touch!

01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:40.521
You... do not... pass!

01:12:41.272 --> 01:12:43.106
The bearded, you clear!

01:12:46.149 --> 01:12:49.066
Ah... It will not be the
same lemonade, there!

01:13:15.785 --> 01:13:20.912
Friends, our freedom is again threatened
by the insidious tentacles...

01:13:21.079 --> 01:13:22.705
COME ON! LET'S GO!

01:13:34.210 --> 01:13:38.336
The Domaine des Dieux hope
you had a pleasant stay

01:13:38.503 --> 01:13:42.547
and invites you to return to Rome by
the outputs provided for this purpose.

01:13:42.714 --> 01:13:44.339
The fun is over!

01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:49.508
This man, Obelix, it's for you.

01:13:49.675 --> 01:13:51.592
- Of course!
- I saw the 1st.

01:13:51.758 --> 01:13:52.801
Watch Out!

01:13:52.968 --> 01:13:53.968
We meet!

01:13:59.262 --> 01:14:01.430
Blows and moans.

01:14:01.596 --> 01:14:03.680
Pull yourself together, for Mars!

01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:10.099
I demand the name of an official.

01:14:10.266 --> 01:14:12.767
The manager called Caesar, ma'am.

01:14:31.942 --> 01:14:33.776
But what do you manufacture?

01:14:33.942 --> 01:14:36.861
It's a long story. At
the end of the project,

01:14:37.028 --> 01:14:39.153
it was necessary to consider retrain.

01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:41.321
And here we were offered...

01:14:41.487 --> 01:14:43.238
After a while it goes.

01:14:54.367 --> 01:14:55.702
Hercules!

01:15:12.834 --> 01:15:16.294
Whatever you my reservations,
Gauls, get dignity...

01:15:16.460 --> 01:15:18.299
You are inflated to talk
about dignity, Jules.

01:15:18.419 --> 01:15:19.503
- How To?
- The coup.

01:15:19.670 --> 01:15:24.297
Domaine des Dieux is sneaky, deceitful,
calculated. You should be ashamed.

01:15:24.464 --> 01:15:28.007
We try stuff. Sometimes
it works, sometimes...

01:15:28.174 --> 01:15:32.300
It does not work. You're going back
to Rome and take them civilians.

01:15:32.467 --> 01:15:35.010
You owe them a luxury accommodation.

01:15:35.176 --> 01:15:38.094
And remember that there
is a village in Brittany

01:15:38.261 --> 01:15:40.303
resists you again and again.

01:15:40.470 --> 01:15:43.846
HOORAY!

01:15:44.013 --> 01:15:47.014
Either... Veni, vidi vici...
not.

01:15:47.181 --> 01:15:49.641
We can not "vici" every time either.

01:15:49.807 --> 01:15:51.934
Come On! Everyone in Rome!

01:16:24.239 --> 01:16:27.365
But I fell into the
potion when I was little.

01:16:27.531 --> 01:16:29.657
So, I'm not allowed to drink.

01:16:29.823 --> 01:16:32.283
Yes, we know... a small drop.

01:16:59.086 --> 01:17:00.446
Thank you for everything, Astérix.

01:17:01.753 --> 01:17:03.921
Rome will seem to us empty.

01:17:04.088 --> 01:17:05.213
Here, Petiminus.

01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:08.006
A memory of Brittany, compliments

01:17:08.173 --> 01:17:10.257
the old Gallic druid.

01:17:10.715 --> 01:17:12.132
Apeldjus cheek.

01:17:15.134 --> 01:17:18.219
Here... It will do
you a figure more.

01:17:18.386 --> 01:17:21.762
I'm sorry, that's all I know carve.

01:17:32.683 --> 01:17:34.517
Apeldjus...

01:17:39.143 --> 01:17:40.687
Watch Out! A menhir!

01:17:41.436 --> 01:17:43.104
And this is for you!

01:17:44.479 --> 01:17:46.105
Roman, Roman!

01:17:46.272 --> 01:17:48.773
The program tonight... it's hard!

01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:51.732
It's formi... It's great!

01:17:54.067 --> 01:17:57.318
The small dry while, you start
by a blow to the liver.

01:17:57.485 --> 01:17:58.485
Then you turn around

01:17:58.652 --> 01:18:01.236
toward the big yucky for sun projection.

01:18:01.403 --> 01:18:04.154
The big yucky, it's me. We leave it?

01:18:04.321 --> 01:18:06.405
After the coup of the robin.

01:18:06.571 --> 01:18:08.739
And it easy, not like in training.

01:18:08.906 --> 01:18:09.906
The "robin"

01:18:10.031 --> 01:18:11.031
what is it again?

01:18:11.074 --> 01:18:13.033
Immobilization, strangulation.

01:18:13.199 --> 01:18:14.450
It was repeated three times!

01:18:14.617 --> 01:18:17.910
Do as in training and
you will not hurt.

01:18:18.077 --> 01:18:19.327
But one got hurt.

01:18:19.494 --> 01:18:20.536
Get hurt!

01:18:20.703 --> 01:18:22.829
You do that in your head!

01:18:22.996 --> 01:18:24.454
Thank the divine Caesar

01:18:24.621 --> 01:18:27.497
for the gladi glagla... the gladiators!

01:18:27.664 --> 01:18:32.416
AVE CAESAR! AVE CAESAR!

01:18:32.582 --> 01:18:33.776
AVE CAESAR!

01:18:51.503 --> 01:18:56.283
Pick me out of here! Or is
it the lions for everyone!

01:18:56.481 --> 01:19:01.411
You hear? Lions for 75,000 people!

01:19:03.054 --> 01:19:04.398
Beautiful!

01:19:04.597 --> 01:19:08.232
He has an incredible talent, it Petiminus!

01:19:08.430 --> 01:19:12.166
That's nice, he dressed you in Gaul...

01:19:12.364 --> 01:19:14.655
Sarcasm recommence the

01:19:14.854 --> 01:19:19.534
I dressed as Roman to approach the enemy.

01:19:19.733 --> 01:19:20.733
Correct!

01:19:20.879 --> 01:19:24.513
Hey! We are Gaulle! It
stands well at the table!

01:19:24.712 --> 01:19:25.712
Traitor!

01:19:25.857 --> 01:19:27.301
Who is a traitor?

01:19:27.501 --> 01:19:29.143
Invincible, it is!

01:19:29.343 --> 01:19:30.536
Not better!

01:19:30.588 --> 01:19:32.978
Irreducible, it is!

01:19:33.177 --> 01:19:34.371
YUP!

01:19:34.471 --> 01:19:37.458
Right, guys? Ir-Re-patible Duke!

01:26:08.207 --> 01:26:10.248
I told him straight out:

01:26:10.447 --> 01:26:13.635
I ce-de-rai not on the claims.

01:26:13.833 --> 01:26:15.527
Finalis sharp!
