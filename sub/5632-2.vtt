Previously on
<i>Bones...</i>

00:02.544 --> 00:03.678
All right, listen,
I gotta go.

00:03.711 --> 00:04.679
See you later, alligators.

00:04.713 --> 00:06.081
All right.

00:06.115 --> 00:07.415
Bye-bye.

00:07.949 --> 00:10.084
SAROYAN:
<i>Got a body torched in a van.</i>

00:10.118 --> 00:11.786
AUBREY:
Looks like a SHIELD .40.

00:11.820 --> 00:13.186
Professional weapon.

00:13.220 --> 00:14.187
It's his gun.

00:14.221 --> 00:16.222
Whose gun?
- Booth's.

00:16.257 --> 00:17.791
CAROLINE:
<i>Agent Miller,</i>

00:17.825 --> 00:19.058
<i>from Internal Investigations.</i>

00:19.093 --> 00:20.226
<i>They sicced her on Booth.</i>

00:20.261 --> 00:23.062
It's Booth's wedding ring.

00:23.097 --> 00:26.633
Oh, God. Is that what I think it is?
- It is.

00:26.668 --> 00:28.302
CAROLINE:
<i>She's been holding back on us.</i>

00:28.336 --> 00:31.070
Miller's partner up and vanished
four days ago.

00:31.105 --> 00:33.006
So why didn't Miller
say anything?

00:33.040 --> 00:34.207
It's not Booth! I have proof.

00:34.241 --> 00:36.242
AUBREY:
<i>Booth has a brother.</i>

00:36.277 --> 00:39.245
I am now certain
that our victim is Jared Booth.

00:39.280 --> 00:41.181
There's a bond between brothers.

00:41.215 --> 00:43.082
<i>What if Booth's brother</i>
<i>needed him?</i>

00:43.117 --> 00:44.618
BRENNAN:
<i>Booth is still out there.</i>

00:52.159 --> 00:54.795
Alex, let's
hurry it up.

00:54.829 --> 00:56.630
Get started
with the gas.

00:56.664 --> 00:57.897
Pete, hand me an incendiary.

00:57.932 --> 00:59.299
I don't want to leave anything

00:59.334 --> 01:01.301
that can trace back to us.

01:01.335 --> 01:03.669
Seeley, get back in the car.

01:03.704 --> 01:05.236
You're in no condition
to be out here.

01:05.271 --> 01:07.072
That's Jared in there.
That's my brother.

01:07.106 --> 01:09.241
You're not the only one
who's hurting here.

01:09.275 --> 01:10.710
Jared was one of us.

01:10.744 --> 01:11.910
We served together.

01:11.945 --> 01:13.746
But the plan stays.

01:13.780 --> 01:15.948
We torch everything.

01:15.982 --> 01:17.350
And if you have a problem
with that,

01:17.384 --> 01:18.751
then you can get in the van

01:18.785 --> 01:19.985
and curl up next to him.

01:26.660 --> 01:29.027
You're right.

01:29.062 --> 01:31.063
Everything's gotta go.

01:31.097 --> 01:34.099
But you're not the one
who's going to do it.

(shuddering)

02:27.787 --> 02:30.154
(panting)

02:30.188 --> 02:31.389
(grunts)

02:33.892 --> 02:35.692
20 bucks says
he doesn't make it.

02:35.727 --> 02:37.194
Twenty?

02:37.229 --> 02:39.030
Man, all I got is hundreds.

02:39.064 --> 02:40.197
(both laugh, phone beeps)

02:40.232 --> 02:42.800
Shut up, both of you.

02:44.403 --> 02:45.970
Is that him?

02:46.004 --> 02:48.005
Yeah, it's on.

02:48.040 --> 02:50.841
Trade's happening today.
- Hell yes!

02:50.875 --> 02:53.077
This two million?
This two million is nothing

02:53.111 --> 02:54.412
compared to what's coming
when we get that list.

02:54.446 --> 02:55.879
(groans)

02:57.115 --> 02:59.250
How long?

02:59.284 --> 03:02.086
Five hours.

03:02.120 --> 03:03.354
You gonna hold out that long?

03:05.890 --> 03:07.891
(exhales)

03:11.729 --> 03:14.064
(panting)

03:15.433 --> 03:17.400
Is he the thug
that shot Booth?

03:17.435 --> 03:21.237
No. According to Angela's
crime scene reconstruction,

03:21.272 --> 03:23.340
this is most
likely the...

03:23.374 --> 03:25.842
the guy who killed Jared.

03:25.876 --> 03:28.811
Okay.

03:28.846 --> 03:30.413
Here's another bullet
for you to analyze.

03:30.448 --> 03:32.215
It looks like a .308,
same as what

03:32.249 --> 03:34.750
we pulled out of Masbourian.
Cam,

03:34.785 --> 03:36.752
I just want to say...

03:36.787 --> 03:38.521
I'm sorry about Jared.

03:38.555 --> 03:41.224
I know when you and Booth
used to date,

03:41.258 --> 03:43.093
he was a big part of your life.

03:43.127 --> 03:44.760
Yeah.

03:44.795 --> 03:46.396
He was like a kid brother.

03:46.430 --> 03:49.532
I mean, the one
that always got into trouble.

03:49.566 --> 03:51.534
But he was family.

03:51.568 --> 03:53.002
(exhales)

03:54.504 --> 03:57.306
Hey. You guys find anything
that can lead us to Booth?

03:57.340 --> 03:59.308
No. Nothing.
I mean, the...

03:59.342 --> 04:01.143
the rounds that Jared
and his crew fired,

04:01.177 --> 04:04.046
they were all standard issue, so
there's no way to trace these.

04:04.080 --> 04:05.514
I hate this.

04:05.548 --> 04:07.416
Booth's blood was all
over that crime scene.

04:07.450 --> 04:08.920
If he doesn't get
medical attention, then...

04:08.944 --> 04:10.119
I know.

04:10.120 --> 04:11.853
Hodgins, go get Dr. Brennan
and Arastoo.

04:11.888 --> 04:14.056
Maybe they'll...
be able to find something

04:14.090 --> 04:16.225
when they look
at the osteological evidence.

04:16.259 --> 04:18.959
Brennan's not here. Aubrey
called her to the FBI.

04:18.995 --> 04:21.363
Apparently Agent Miller
hasn't been telling us

04:21.398 --> 04:23.098
everything
she knows.

04:29.305 --> 04:30.804
BRENNAN:
<i>Why aren't you</i>

04:30.839 --> 04:32.440
telling us the truth?

04:32.474 --> 04:36.577
If your partner is missing, he
may be held captive with Booth.

04:36.611 --> 04:38.212
I am offering
to help you find him.

04:38.247 --> 04:40.548
Unless you already know
that your partner is dead.

04:40.582 --> 04:42.483
Or he's the one
doing the capturing.

04:42.518 --> 04:44.485
Either way,
if you don't start talking,

04:44.520 --> 04:46.521
I'm charging you
with obstruction of justice

04:46.555 --> 04:48.556
and you can kiss this case
good-bye.

04:52.361 --> 04:54.328
All right, you want the truth?

04:54.363 --> 04:57.031
Four days ago, just before
Richard went missing,

04:57.066 --> 04:59.434
he downloaded
and printed out a list.

04:59.468 --> 05:02.070
Why do I get the feeling
you're not talking groceries?

05:02.104 --> 05:03.471
Undercover agents.

05:03.505 --> 05:06.074
Anyone from the Bureau embedded
in criminal

05:06.108 --> 05:07.942
or terrorist organizations.

05:07.976 --> 05:09.810
Your partner is a traitor,

05:09.844 --> 05:12.980
willing to let
good agents die for money.

05:13.014 --> 05:14.247
But rather than share that

05:14.282 --> 05:16.584
with us, you accuse
my husband

05:16.618 --> 05:18.085
of murdering his own brother.

05:18.119 --> 05:19.086
Your husband went missing

05:19.120 --> 05:20.621
two days after Richard.

05:20.655 --> 05:23.023
You can't tell me
that that's a coincidence.

05:23.058 --> 05:24.992
I'm gonna need an address
for your partner's house.

05:25.026 --> 05:27.327
I'll take Dr. Brennan and see
if we can find any evidence

05:27.361 --> 05:29.529
that points
to where he slithered off to.

05:29.564 --> 05:31.865
No. Richard's disappearance
is not your case.

05:31.900 --> 05:33.533
You just made it my case.
As you said,

05:33.568 --> 05:36.203
it can't be a coincidence
when two agents go missing.

05:36.237 --> 05:38.305
My team has already searched
his apartment.

05:38.339 --> 05:40.207
Your team
is not the Jeffersonian.

05:40.241 --> 05:42.643
The Jeffersonian
is not the only lab in town.

05:42.677 --> 05:44.478
It's not even the best.

05:44.512 --> 05:46.246
It hasn't been since you quit.

05:46.280 --> 05:49.416
Then you should
consider me back.

06:00.995 --> 06:03.963
Nice place. He live here alone?

06:03.998 --> 06:07.134
No. Richard was
recently engaged.

06:07.168 --> 06:10.203
His fiancée moved in
here about a month ago.

06:10.238 --> 06:12.272
Did you know her?

06:12.306 --> 06:14.006
Just a little.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.975
Her name's Chloe Robertson.
She's a lawyer.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.577
Richard met her
less than six months ago.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.379
Okay. I'm gonna need
to talk to her.

06:20.413 --> 06:22.248
Well, good luck with that.
No one's seen Chloe

06:22.282 --> 06:24.250
since Richard went missing.

06:24.284 --> 06:27.620
Working theory is that
they ran off together.

06:35.695 --> 06:38.531
MILLER: You're
wasting your time.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.699
My team found
no evidence of a struggle.

06:40.733 --> 06:42.307
What about his computer
and his cell phone?

06:42.331 --> 06:44.135
We took them. But so far

06:44.136 --> 06:46.571
we haven't found anything of interest.
BRENNAN: Well,

06:46.605 --> 06:50.375
we'll need whatever you took
sent to the lab.

06:50.409 --> 06:51.976
Agent Aubrey,

06:52.010 --> 06:54.045
this is not the time or place
for a snack.

06:54.079 --> 06:56.214
No, I'm not hungry.
Okay, that's a lie.

06:56.248 --> 06:57.982
But I always say
if you really want

06:58.016 --> 06:59.551
to understand
a man,

06:59.585 --> 07:01.919
look in his fridge.
So, we got some wine,

07:01.953 --> 07:03.921
we got some cheese. Ugh!

07:03.955 --> 07:06.524
No beer,
no cold cuts.

07:06.559 --> 07:09.194
Looks like a traitor's fridge
if I ever saw one.

07:09.228 --> 07:11.362
BRENNAN:
There's blood.

07:11.397 --> 07:14.464
Almost imperceptible but...

07:22.607 --> 07:24.208
What are you doing?
I thought you said

07:24.242 --> 07:26.310
this wasn't the time or place
for a snack.

07:33.618 --> 07:35.619
I don't think
this is meant to be consumed.

With discoloration
at the point of severing.

08:18.442 --> 08:20.410
The discoloration is

08:20.444 --> 08:22.979
simply frozen blood.
It's not probative.

08:23.013 --> 08:25.048
SAROYAN:
There's also some skin slippage.

08:25.082 --> 08:27.112
Best guess is it's been on ice
for about a week.

08:27.212 --> 08:30.387
Now I must insist that you let me
examine the evidence.

08:30.421 --> 08:33.089
Just a second.
I still need to run a print.

08:33.123 --> 08:36.092

That's the problem, Dr. Vaziri.

08:42.366 --> 08:44.801
Some people's best
is better than others'.

08:45.903 --> 08:47.337
I'm sorry.

08:47.371 --> 08:49.138
I thought we had moved past
my previous error

08:49.173 --> 08:51.007
in misidentifying
Booth's remains.

08:51.041 --> 08:53.310
We had, but apparently
that's not the only error

08:53.344 --> 08:54.777
this lab has made.

08:54.812 --> 08:56.979
I've been told
that in my absence

08:57.014 --> 08:59.651
the Jeffersonian is
no longer considered

08:59.652 --> 09:02.195
this country's
foremost forensic laboratory.

09:02.196 --> 09:04.988
Dr. Brennan, I appreciate
how worried you are about Booth,

09:05.022 --> 09:07.156
but right now
is not the time for

09:07.191 --> 09:08.991
whatever criticisms
you may have.

09:09.026 --> 09:11.094
Here. You can conduct

09:11.128 --> 09:13.129
your analysis
while I run

09:13.163 --> 09:14.931
a print.

09:14.965 --> 09:17.700
VAZIRI:
Look at the striae.

09:17.735 --> 09:20.469
This finger wasn't cut by a knife.
You are correct. The striae

09:20.503 --> 09:23.706
are bidirectional,
which means it was cut

09:23.741 --> 09:27.276
simultaneously from an upward
and downward direction.

09:27.310 --> 09:28.878
Like cigar cutters?

09:28.912 --> 09:31.447
More like scissors.
The two sides meet

09:31.481 --> 09:33.883
at a hinge in the bone.
I'll have

09:33.917 --> 09:35.951
Dr. Hodgins
swab for trace.

09:35.985 --> 09:38.186
(trilling)

09:42.425 --> 09:45.093
SAROYAN: And I'll let
Aubrey know that we've got

09:45.128 --> 09:48.096
an I.D. Chloe Robertson.

09:48.131 --> 09:50.132
Agent Bannerman's fiancée.

09:51.968 --> 09:54.270
MILLER:
<i>You sure it's Chloe?</i>

09:54.304 --> 09:56.438
Are you still doubting
the Jeffersonian,

09:56.473 --> 09:59.040
even after your lab
somehow missed a severed finger

09:59.075 --> 10:01.042
next to a box of Meat Pockets?

10:01.077 --> 10:02.911
AUBREY:
Okay, Caroline.

10:02.945 --> 10:05.046
Just relax, okay?

10:05.081 --> 10:07.048
Agent Miller's
just now realizing

10:07.083 --> 10:09.351
that every assumption
she's made has been wrong.

10:09.386 --> 10:12.587
So you think Chloe
was being held for ransom.

10:12.621 --> 10:14.422
I think it's the only scenario
that makes sense.

10:14.456 --> 10:17.592
The finger was probably sent
as a threat or proof of life.

10:17.626 --> 10:19.294
So she was kidnapped,
which would force Richard

10:19.328 --> 10:21.061
to download that list.

10:21.096 --> 10:23.063
So it looks like your partner
isn't so bad after all.

10:23.098 --> 10:25.833
Just a guy who wanted
to help out someone he loved.

10:25.867 --> 10:27.335
Sounds a lot like Booth.
That's what

10:27.369 --> 10:28.503
doesn't make sense.
What does the list

10:28.537 --> 10:30.104
have to do with Booth?
- My bet

10:30.138 --> 10:32.106
is that it has to do
with the $2 million

10:32.140 --> 10:33.608
that Jared helped to steal.

10:33.642 --> 10:35.310
Jared got in over his head
with the crew

10:35.344 --> 10:37.011
that wanted to buy the list.

10:37.045 --> 10:39.414
Then Booth insinuates himself
to make sure

10:39.448 --> 10:42.216
the wrong people don't get
their grubby little hands on it.

10:42.250 --> 10:44.768
Booth isn't gonna give up
till he gets ahold of that list.

10:44.792 --> 10:45.920
No, he isn't.

10:45.921 --> 10:48.889
Which means he's either
gonna get it and be a hero

10:48.924 --> 10:53.327
or the poor boy's
gonna die trying.

10:53.361 --> 10:55.562
(panting, groaning)

11:01.536 --> 11:04.471
(grunting)
- PETE: Hey, look at this.

11:04.505 --> 11:06.840
It's the walking dead.

11:06.874 --> 11:09.008
KEVIN:
Seeley, what are you doing?

11:09.043 --> 11:11.445
You know I can't let you leave.

11:11.479 --> 11:13.112
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm just...

11:13.147 --> 11:15.449
I'm still hemorrhaging here.

11:15.483 --> 11:17.016
KEVIN: I don't have
any more gauze.

11:17.051 --> 11:19.052
We can't risk
going out for more.

11:19.086 --> 11:21.120
What's this?

11:21.155 --> 11:23.289
Nothing. Just some
photography equipment.

11:23.324 --> 11:24.624
The old man
who used to own this place

11:24.659 --> 11:26.025
used the bathroom
as a dark room.

11:26.060 --> 11:29.395
Seeley, see this?
It's the light.

11:29.429 --> 11:31.364
Go to the light.

11:33.267 --> 11:35.368
(panting)

11:35.402 --> 11:38.637
This is it.

11:38.672 --> 11:40.192
Dude, what the hell
are you doing, man?

11:41.742 --> 11:45.245
I got to cauterize it.

11:45.279 --> 11:47.613
You got to cauterize it.

11:49.483 --> 11:51.617
(grunts)
ALEX: What is that?

11:51.651 --> 11:53.419
Silver nitrate.

11:53.453 --> 11:56.289
It's gonna heat the wound,
forcing the blood to coagulate.

11:56.323 --> 11:58.724
(panting)

12:00.027 --> 12:03.096
(grunts)

12:04.598 --> 12:07.065
(panting)

12:07.100 --> 12:09.668
(hissing, muffled yell)

12:09.703 --> 12:11.404
God! Aah!

12:11.438 --> 12:14.239
(grunting)

12:15.475 --> 12:17.643
(grunting continues)

12:19.546 --> 12:22.047
(Booth yelling)

12:24.150 --> 12:27.586
HODGINS: <i>Looks like</i>
<i>some trace transferred off</i>

12:27.621 --> 12:29.722
whatever was used
to sever the finger.

12:29.756 --> 12:32.024
I'm gonna run it
through the mass spec.

12:32.058 --> 12:34.259
Let's hope you find something.

12:34.294 --> 12:37.128
I think if Dr. Brennan had her
way, she'd fire both me and Cam.

12:37.162 --> 12:38.463
She's not gonna fire anyone.

12:38.497 --> 12:40.298
I wouldn't be so sure.

12:40.332 --> 12:42.667
She heard the Jeffersonian took
a hit since she's been gone.

12:42.701 --> 12:46.771
Oh. Those rankings are
completely arbitrary.

12:46.806 --> 12:51.008
They have as much to do with
funding and papers as they do

12:51.043 --> 12:52.777
actual forensic work.
HODGINS: To be fair,

12:52.812 --> 12:54.412
there've been more
unsolved cases

12:54.447 --> 12:56.514
ever since Dr. Brennan left.

12:59.217 --> 13:00.585
That wasn't helpful, was it?

13:00.619 --> 13:02.386
MONTENEGRO:
You can't blame yourself,

13:02.421 --> 13:04.722
especially if Brennan
doesn't even blame you.

13:04.757 --> 13:06.424
Okay, at the
end of the day,

13:06.459 --> 13:08.459
Brennan knows she's
the one who quit,

13:08.493 --> 13:11.161
so, whatever cases went
unsolved are on her conscience.

13:11.195 --> 13:13.330
They're not on ours.
(beeping)

13:13.364 --> 13:17.434
Okay, talk to me,
my elemental friends.

13:17.469 --> 13:20.571
Who is here? Carbon,
manganese, phosphorous, sulfur.

13:20.605 --> 13:22.105
Yeah, you put those together,
that makes steel.

13:22.139 --> 13:23.440
HODGINS:
Yes, unfortunately,

13:23.475 --> 13:25.108
though, that is just
the appetizer.

13:25.142 --> 13:26.510
We've also got lead,

13:26.544 --> 13:28.244
arsenic, zinc, potassium,

13:28.279 --> 13:30.647
and some kind
of low-density polyethylene.

13:32.183 --> 13:33.784
Polyethylene and the steel.

13:33.818 --> 13:36.186
They go together
in making chain link fence.

13:36.220 --> 13:37.520
VAZIRI:
That makes sense.

13:37.554 --> 13:38.688
Chloe Robertson's

13:38.722 --> 13:40.357
finger was cut

13:40.391 --> 13:42.225
using a hinged tool,
so, wire cutters would fit.

13:42.259 --> 13:44.627
So, wait--
before cutting off the finger,

13:44.661 --> 13:47.063
whoever was behind this
used wire cutters

13:47.098 --> 13:51.734
on a fence in what sounds like
a horribly noxious environment.

13:51.768 --> 13:54.570
Angie, you're a genius.

13:54.605 --> 13:57.140
So, I almost demonstrated
against this place.

13:57.174 --> 13:58.641
It's in Loudoun County.

13:58.675 --> 14:00.477
There's this battery
recycling facility

14:00.511 --> 14:02.751
that was closed down recently
because of all the arsenic,

14:02.779 --> 14:05.180
lead and sulfur
that it was emitting.

14:05.215 --> 14:07.316
An abandoned factory
in a rural location

14:07.350 --> 14:09.318
is a perfect place
to hold someone hostage.

14:09.352 --> 14:11.387
Yeah, and if Booth's been taken,
that could be where he is.

14:11.421 --> 14:12.755
I'll call Aubrey.

14:15.258 --> 14:18.227
(engine revving)

14:24.100 --> 14:26.268
(crow cawing)

14:30.106 --> 14:32.374
Hey, Aubrey...

14:34.210 --> 14:36.512
...this looks like it was cut
with wire cutters.

14:36.546 --> 14:39.181
Yeah, I'd say this is
definitely the place.

14:51.493 --> 14:53.461
You seeing anything?

14:53.495 --> 14:55.229
Yeah.

14:55.264 --> 14:57.265
40-caliber round.

14:57.299 --> 14:59.701
Look at this.

14:59.735 --> 15:01.469
Blood spatter from a gunshot.

15:01.503 --> 15:02.837
MILLER:
Blood's already dry.

15:02.872 --> 15:06.407
Which means
we're too late.

15:06.442 --> 15:08.810
(bird squawking)

15:08.844 --> 15:11.412
A scavenger.

15:11.447 --> 15:14.715
(bird squawking)

15:15.917 --> 15:18.419
(squawking)

15:20.789 --> 15:23.124
MILLER:
Oh, my God.

15:23.158 --> 15:24.625
It's two bodies.

15:24.659 --> 15:27.261
They've been covered
in battery acid.

15:29.298 --> 15:34.267
(birds squawking)

15:39.507 --> 15:41.341
(bird squawks)

15:42.683 --> 15:43.691
VAZIRI:
Dr. Brennan.

15:43.715 --> 15:45.146
Look at the left scapula.

15:45.230 --> 15:46.530
There's no remodeling.

15:46.564 --> 15:48.663
Which means
this victim is not Booth.

15:48.763 --> 15:50.698
What about this one?
- No.

15:50.798 --> 15:53.600
Based on the circular pelvic
inlet, the other set is female.

15:53.904 --> 15:56.006
The female victim
is also missing

15:56.040 --> 15:57.641
her right, fifth phalanx.

15:57.675 --> 16:00.410
So then, this is
Agent Bannerman's fiancée.

16:00.445 --> 16:01.977
It would appear so.

16:02.012 --> 16:04.580
Still, we should do a facial
reconstruction for confirmation.

16:04.615 --> 16:07.750
It's rare that we get vultures
around here.

16:07.784 --> 16:09.952
What I can't believe is, a
vulture would have gnawed

16:09.986 --> 16:12.588
on these bodies even after they
were dosed in sulfuric acid.

16:12.623 --> 16:14.524
HODGINS: Trust me,
a vulture's stomach acid

16:14.558 --> 16:16.359
is around a one
on the pH scale.

16:16.393 --> 16:18.528
To them, battery acid
is like a nice salsa.

16:18.562 --> 16:22.765
Well, cause of death appears
to be a gunshot to the chest.

16:22.799 --> 16:25.468
Uh, the good news is, the acid

16:25.502 --> 16:27.470
didn't compromise
the internal organs.

16:27.504 --> 16:28.971
Bad news is, I don't see

16:29.005 --> 16:30.706
how either one of these
bodies leads us to Booth.

16:30.740 --> 16:32.375
Yeah, I hate to say it,
but Arastoo's right.

16:32.409 --> 16:33.809
I mean, these bodies were killed

16:33.843 --> 16:35.511
at a recycling plant
in Loudoun County.

16:35.546 --> 16:37.846
Booth was shot during
a heist in McLean, Virginia.

16:37.881 --> 16:39.515
There's no point
of intersection.

16:39.550 --> 16:40.916
You are correct.

16:40.950 --> 16:42.584
Still, I believe if we press on,

16:42.618 --> 16:44.586
we will find
the answers we need.

16:44.620 --> 16:46.421
So you're saying you have faith?

16:46.455 --> 16:48.757
I'm saying...

16:48.792 --> 16:52.194
I can't imagine a world
where Booth doesn't come home.

16:57.667 --> 16:59.634
Excuse me.
I don't mean to interrupt.

16:59.669 --> 17:01.870
I'm looking
for Angela Montenegro?

17:01.905 --> 17:03.706
Yeah. I'm her husband.
Who are you?

17:03.740 --> 17:06.641
Well, whoever you are,
this is not a good time

17:06.675 --> 17:08.877
for a massage or a
strip tease or whatever

17:08.912 --> 17:10.913
societal function
you may perform.

17:10.946 --> 17:12.815
I'm Dr. Benjamin Metzger.

17:12.848 --> 17:15.017
Uh, Agent Miller sent me.
I'm a digital forensic

17:15.050 --> 17:17.853
scientist with the Bureau.

17:19.722 --> 17:21.923
If it helps,
I usually wear my glasses.

17:21.957 --> 17:23.925
Oh, and I have carpal tunnel.

17:23.959 --> 17:26.961
And two cats at home
named Stephen and Hawking.

17:32.101 --> 17:34.936
Thank you for your help.
- Oh.

17:34.970 --> 17:36.738
I seem to be all
butterfingers today.

17:36.772 --> 17:39.140
No. No. No problem.
I'm happy to help.

17:41.509 --> 17:43.477
So, <i>Doctor</i> Metzger, is it?

17:43.511 --> 17:45.980
Yes, I got my doctorate in
computer science at Stanford.

17:46.014 --> 17:47.815
I also ran on
the track team.

17:47.850 --> 17:50.251
Long distance. Kind of
an endurance guy.

17:50.285 --> 17:52.253
Of course you are.

17:52.287 --> 17:54.055
(computer trilling)
- Huh.

17:54.089 --> 17:56.590
Looks like you were right--
Agent Bannerman's hard drive

17:56.625 --> 17:58.925
is completely empty.
METZGER: His cell phone, too.

17:58.960 --> 18:02.129
I've run recovery software,
but they're both wiped clean.

18:03.865 --> 18:05.866
Is he serving a
purpose by being here?

18:05.900 --> 18:10.137
Yes. I'm, you know,
swabbing the victim's cell.

18:10.171 --> 18:12.205
Oh, it's okay. I see
what's happening.

18:12.240 --> 18:14.074
How long have you
two been married?

18:14.108 --> 18:16.810
Six years,
thank you very much. Why?

18:16.844 --> 18:19.112
Ah, I got it. You're worried
about the seven year itch.

18:19.147 --> 18:22.650
No. Trust me, there is no itch.

18:22.684 --> 18:25.786
Dr. Hodgins, I assure you,
I am only here to help.

18:25.820 --> 18:27.721
Hey. Dr. Brennan got an I.D.

18:27.756 --> 18:29.723
on the second body
from dental records.

18:29.758 --> 18:31.958
It's Agent Bannerman.

18:31.993 --> 18:34.594
Oh, God.

18:34.628 --> 18:37.664
(crying softly)

18:37.698 --> 18:39.032
I'm sorry. It's this job.
It, um...

18:39.066 --> 18:40.934
It gets to you
sometimes. (sniffles)

18:40.968 --> 18:43.036
It's okay, man. We understand.

18:43.070 --> 18:45.105
Did you know him well?

18:45.139 --> 18:47.540
Yeah, we worked together a lot.

18:47.574 --> 18:49.142
Okay, well, let's focus

18:49.177 --> 18:51.278
on finding the person
responsible for all this.

18:51.312 --> 18:53.013
Hodgins, you're with me.

18:53.047 --> 18:54.014
I need to...

18:54.048 --> 18:55.048
Uh, no.

18:55.082 --> 18:56.749
(clears throat)
Okay.

19:04.793 --> 19:06.873
AUBREY: <i>Why don't you show me</i>
<i>what you're working on?</i>

19:07.400 --> 19:09.267
Okay, um...

19:09.549 --> 19:10.916
using street cameras,

19:10.950 --> 19:13.185
Dr. Metzger was tracking
Richard's movements

19:13.219 --> 19:14.787
the week before
he went missing.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.523
He go any place
out of the ordinary?

19:17.557 --> 19:19.792
Well, nothing that surveillance
picked up, but look at this.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.628
The same blue van shows up
in each one of these feeds.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.129
And it's not a coincidence.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.664
Each of these feeds was taken

19:25.699 --> 19:27.098
at a different time
on a different day.

19:27.133 --> 19:29.167
So, your partner
was being followed.

19:29.202 --> 19:31.637
Did you run the plates?
No, it's a dead end.

19:31.671 --> 19:32.971
The plates are registered
to the owner

19:33.005 --> 19:34.773
of a silver compact
here in DC.

19:34.808 --> 19:36.809
Which means that the plates
are stolen, but my guess is

19:36.843 --> 19:39.745
so was the van.
- Whoever this is--

19:39.779 --> 19:42.080
that's who we need to find.

19:46.618 --> 19:48.186
That was quick.

19:48.221 --> 19:50.688
You and Dr. B are done
with Agent Bannerman's remains?

19:50.723 --> 19:53.358
Not yet, but we did find
antemortem greenstick fractures

19:53.392 --> 19:55.160
on the left fifth
and six ribs.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.028
Also bone bruising
to the phalanges

19:57.063 --> 19:58.596
and metacarpals
of the right hand.

19:58.630 --> 20:00.165
Oh, it sounds like
he got into a fight.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.933
How extensive was
the remodeling?

20:01.968 --> 20:03.601
Barely any at all.

20:03.635 --> 20:05.203
The fight probably took
place about a week ago.

20:05.238 --> 20:06.905
What about cause of death?

20:06.939 --> 20:08.306
We're still looking
for the precise cause,

20:08.341 --> 20:10.108
but the skull was
heavily damaged.

20:10.142 --> 20:12.978
Dr. Brennan requested that I
give her some time to herself.

20:16.848 --> 20:18.382
How you coming along?

20:18.416 --> 20:20.150
Honestly,
it's not looking good.

20:20.185 --> 20:22.253
The only thing we found
in Chloe Robertson's stomach

20:22.287 --> 20:23.820
is doxepin.

20:23.855 --> 20:25.155
I read the
medical records.

20:25.190 --> 20:26.656
There was no mention
of antidepressants.

20:26.691 --> 20:28.125
That's because she was drugged.

20:28.159 --> 20:30.060
Someone slipped it
into something that she ate.

20:30.095 --> 20:31.862
I gotta figure out
what it was.

20:36.801 --> 20:39.203
Arastoo, I'm sorry
about Dr. Brennan.

20:39.237 --> 20:41.705
I mean, this case...
I understand.

20:41.739 --> 20:44.173
And I hope you know that if
she trusted any other intern

20:44.208 --> 20:46.342
more than you, she would have
already called them.

20:46.377 --> 20:48.344
Thank you.

20:48.379 --> 20:51.214
Still, I think it's time I start
looking elsewhere for a job.

20:51.248 --> 20:53.283
What?!

20:53.317 --> 20:56.485
No, you're-you're my choice as
Head of Forensic Anthropology.

20:56.520 --> 20:58.221
If you really thought
I was right for the job,

20:58.255 --> 21:00.423
you would have submitted
my candidacy months ago.

21:00.457 --> 21:02.658
Arastoo, please, I can't...
I know if

21:02.692 --> 21:05.395
you keep searching, you'll find
the person you're looking for.

21:05.429 --> 21:07.696
It's okay.

21:12.236 --> 21:15.371
(groaning)

21:15.406 --> 21:17.907
You look like hell.

21:19.743 --> 21:21.977
Look, I'm gonna be okay.

21:22.011 --> 21:23.712
I know.

21:23.747 --> 21:26.048
Before, you looked like death.
Hell is an improvement.

21:26.082 --> 21:28.016
Thanks.

21:28.051 --> 21:30.052
You know, that was some real
brass balls stuff

21:30.086 --> 21:31.787
you did back there
healing yourself up.

21:31.822 --> 21:33.355
You sure you weren't Navy?

21:33.389 --> 21:35.724
No.

21:35.759 --> 21:38.393
All right, just a couple
more hours before the trade.

21:38.428 --> 21:40.095
Yeah, I'll be ready.

21:44.434 --> 21:46.902
Jared was a good soldier.

21:46.937 --> 21:49.271
And he didn't...

21:49.305 --> 21:51.807
he didn't deserve
to die like that.

21:55.044 --> 21:57.379
(phone ringing)

21:59.882 --> 22:01.816
Everything okay?

22:01.851 --> 22:03.485
Uh, yeah.

22:03.519 --> 22:05.354
It's all good.

22:07.457 --> 22:10.192
Nothing to worry about.

22:19.368 --> 22:20.902
You wanted to see me?

22:21.970 --> 22:24.560
I found a
fragment of metal.

22:24.660 --> 22:26.870
I want you to give to
Dr. Hodgins for analysis.

22:26.970 --> 22:28.704
It was
lodged within

22:28.739 --> 22:31.507
a comminuted fracture
on the left zygomatic.

22:31.542 --> 22:33.175
Is there anything else
I can help with?

22:33.209 --> 22:35.011
Have you found cause of death?

22:35.045 --> 22:38.447
The victim suffered an anterior
penetrating wound to the left

22:38.481 --> 22:40.983
tenth rib, but the
wound was not fatal.

22:41.018 --> 22:43.986
So he was shot
in the inferior thorax.

22:44.021 --> 22:47.322
An injury very similar
to the one Booth sustained.

22:47.357 --> 22:49.291
I keep picturing
how this man died

22:49.325 --> 22:51.160
and then
projecting

22:51.194 --> 22:54.997
the same scenario
with Booth as the victim.

22:55.032 --> 22:56.932
That's not gonna happen.

22:56.966 --> 22:59.400
We're gonna find Booth.
He's gonna be fine.

22:59.435 --> 23:01.402
Agent Bannerman
was just like Booth.

23:01.437 --> 23:04.472
He was an FBI agent.
He was well-trained.

23:06.308 --> 23:10.078
Look at the damage
to the zygomatic.

23:10.112 --> 23:12.146
The killer struck him
numerous times,

23:12.181 --> 23:14.649
many more than would be
necessary in order to...

23:14.684 --> 23:16.651
incapacitate or even to kill.

23:16.686 --> 23:19.554
(phone ringing)
- Oh.

23:19.589 --> 23:21.089
It's Christine.

23:21.123 --> 23:23.091
Um, my dad is
watching her,

23:23.125 --> 23:26.294
but she's getting increasingly
worried about Booth.

23:26.328 --> 23:27.996
I'll give you your privacy.
- Oh.

23:28.030 --> 23:30.999
Unless you would like me to stay.
- Mmm.

23:31.033 --> 23:34.502
Hi, sweetie.
How are you?

23:34.536 --> 23:37.105
I'm fine.

23:37.139 --> 23:40.608
I'm just at work.

23:40.642 --> 23:43.611
Your dad...
(sighs)

23:43.645 --> 23:47.381
he's not here, but
I'm working hard

23:47.416 --> 23:49.383
to bring him
home to you

23:49.418 --> 23:51.051
as soon as possible.

23:51.086 --> 23:52.820
MONTENEGRO:
<i>Well, at first,</i>

23:52.854 --> 23:55.456
we thought Agent Bannerman's
cell phone was wiped clean,

23:55.491 --> 23:58.426
same as his computer.
- But what actually happened

23:58.460 --> 24:00.294
was the cell's memory
was attacked by a virus

24:00.329 --> 24:02.330
probably sent over an e-mail.

24:02.364 --> 24:03.998
Were you able
to recover the memory?

24:04.032 --> 24:06.033
Not everything.
But so far

24:06.067 --> 24:09.103
Dr. Metzger has been able
to retrieve a handful of photo

24:09.137 --> 24:11.505
and video files.
METZGER: Which might be all you need.

24:11.539 --> 24:13.440
Did Agent Miller mention
the surveillance footage

24:13.474 --> 24:15.208
of the blue van
following Agent Bannerman?

24:15.243 --> 24:16.543
She did,
but the plates were stolen,

24:16.577 --> 24:18.378
so there was no way
to identify the driver.

24:18.412 --> 24:21.381
Well, there is now.
This was taken

24:21.415 --> 24:23.216
a week
ago.

24:23.251 --> 24:26.153
SAROYAN: Arastoo said the victim got
into a fight a week ago.

24:26.187 --> 24:28.054
Yeah. Now you have
a front row seat.

24:28.088 --> 24:29.556
His name's Nathan Barlow.
He's a member of the Brand,

24:29.590 --> 24:31.224
also known
as the Aryan Brotherhood.

24:31.259 --> 24:34.561
Yeah, I'm all too familiar
with that organization.

24:34.595 --> 24:37.164
Hey! Hey, you!

24:37.198 --> 24:39.432
What are you doing back there?

24:39.467 --> 24:41.100
You making a video?

24:41.135 --> 24:42.769
Here, I'll give you
something worth filming.

24:42.803 --> 24:44.337
SAROYAN: Wow.

24:44.372 --> 24:46.739
Good work.
Have you contacted Aubrey?

24:46.774 --> 24:51.443
And Agent Miller. They're
bringing Barlow in as we speak.

24:51.478 --> 24:53.780
BARLOW:
<i>No. No way.</i>

24:53.814 --> 24:57.050
I'm not saying a word. Not until
she gets the hell out of here.

24:57.084 --> 25:00.619
Now, Nathan, what on earth could
an Aryan Brother like yourself

25:00.654 --> 25:02.188
have against me?

25:02.222 --> 25:03.790
She's not the one
you should be worried about.

25:03.824 --> 25:06.693
Agent Miller here's
Richard Bannerman's partner.

25:06.727 --> 25:09.095
You remember him, don't you?

25:09.129 --> 25:10.362
He's the one
that you chased

25:10.397 --> 25:11.397
all over town. The one

25:11.431 --> 25:12.765
that you beat the crap out of.

25:12.800 --> 25:14.266
The one that you murdered.

25:14.301 --> 25:16.268
Him and his fiancée.

25:16.303 --> 25:17.770
What the hell
are you talking about?

25:17.805 --> 25:19.605
I didn't kill Richard.

25:19.639 --> 25:21.539
I was his informant.

25:21.574 --> 25:23.608
No. He wasn't his C.I.

25:23.642 --> 25:25.610
Richard would have told me.
I'm not

25:25.644 --> 25:27.679
buying it either.
Typically speaking,

25:27.714 --> 25:30.582
C.I.s don't give a beat-down
to their handler.

25:30.616 --> 25:32.383
Look, I just gave him a few jabs

25:32.418 --> 25:33.852
to make it look good
for the others,

25:33.886 --> 25:35.754
so they didn't think
I was a rat.

25:35.788 --> 25:38.156
Trust me,
he gave as good as he got.

25:38.191 --> 25:39.290
When was the
last time

25:39.325 --> 25:41.426
you saw him?
- A week ago.

25:41.460 --> 25:44.662
Gave him a tip on some product
being moved over in Greenbelt.

25:44.697 --> 25:47.432
I don't believe you.
You're lying.

25:47.466 --> 25:49.300
I'm not lying, gorgeous.

25:49.335 --> 25:51.469
Maybe you just didn't know
your partner

25:51.503 --> 25:53.772
as well as you thought you did.

25:57.210 --> 25:59.744
HODGINS:
<i>Cam, so,</i>

25:59.778 --> 26:02.447
I finished my analysis of Chloe
Robertson's stomach contents.

26:02.481 --> 26:04.682
Did you figure out how the
Doxepin was administered?

26:04.717 --> 26:06.751
Well, in her stomach,
I found

26:06.785 --> 26:08.319
cow's milk, penicillium,

26:08.354 --> 26:10.154
grape extract,
ethanol,

26:10.188 --> 26:12.290
carbon dioxide--
or as most people call it,

26:12.324 --> 26:14.225
wine and cheese.

26:14.260 --> 26:16.902
Seems like a pretty intimate way
to knock somebody out.

26:16.903 --> 26:19.231
Even more than you think.
So, in Bannerman's apartment,

26:19.265 --> 26:21.399
Aubrey found in the fridge
a half-drunk bottle

26:21.433 --> 26:22.800
of chardonnay
and an English Stilton.

26:22.834 --> 26:25.737
Which implies that Chloe dined
with her killer

26:25.771 --> 26:27.905
at the apartment
she shared with Bannerman.

26:27.939 --> 26:29.506
She knew her killer.

26:29.540 --> 26:32.476
Hey. So, I accessed the cloud

26:32.510 --> 26:34.478
on Agent Bannerman's
personal cell phone,

26:34.512 --> 26:37.408
and I found some photos
that had been deleted.

26:37.409 --> 26:40.217
Show me what you've got, and
I'll send it over to the FBI.

26:40.251 --> 26:43.420
Uh, I think Aubrey
should see this in person.

26:45.657 --> 26:47.223
Thanks for the Intel.

26:47.258 --> 26:48.625
Nathan Barlow
was telling the truth.

26:48.660 --> 26:49.826
Bannerman
was using him

26:49.860 --> 26:50.994
as a C.I.

26:51.028 --> 26:52.696
Great. So now a Nazi like Barlow

26:52.730 --> 26:53.897
is one of the good guys.

26:53.931 --> 26:55.899
I've got something
you need to see.

26:55.933 --> 26:57.767
CAROLINE: I'll go get
Agent Miller.

26:57.801 --> 26:59.735
The woman wants to be in
on everything.

26:59.770 --> 27:02.271
Not this. These are photos
Angela was able to retrieve

27:02.306 --> 27:04.173
from Agent Bannerman's
cloud account.

27:04.207 --> 27:05.708
Looks to me

27:05.742 --> 27:08.544
like Agent Miller wasn't
just Bannerman's partner.

27:08.578 --> 27:10.680
When were these taken?
Six months ago.

27:10.714 --> 27:13.215
Bannerman deleted them
after he met Chloe Robertson.

27:13.249 --> 27:15.217
I take it Agent Miller
didn't tell you

27:15.251 --> 27:17.653
about this relationship?
No, she did not.

27:17.688 --> 27:22.525
She took over this investigation
so it wouldn't lead back to her.

27:23.760 --> 27:25.760
(speaking indistinctly)

27:30.439 --> 27:32.294
This is insane. I'm in charge
of this investigation.

27:32.394 --> 27:34.251
I'm not gonna allow you
to interrogate me.

27:35.345 --> 27:37.546
AUBREY: You're gonna answer
our questions.

27:37.581 --> 27:38.782
Now, we can do
that in here,

27:38.816 --> 27:40.583
or we can go back out
to the bullpen

27:40.617 --> 27:42.451
and put on a show for everyone.

27:43.687 --> 27:45.822
Richard and I
had a relationship.

27:45.856 --> 27:48.758
End of story.
Motive is never the end of the story.

27:48.793 --> 27:50.459
You're wasting valuable time.

27:50.494 --> 27:52.162
There's someone out there
selling a list

27:52.196 --> 27:54.630
that could have over 100
of our agents killed.

27:54.665 --> 27:56.432
Or that someone
could be in here with us.

27:56.466 --> 27:58.268
I had access to the list.

27:58.302 --> 28:00.436
If I wanted it,
I didn't need Richard.

28:00.470 --> 28:03.173
Oh, I think you did. Because
if you downloaded the list

28:03.207 --> 28:04.640
and went missing,
you'd have every agency

28:04.675 --> 28:06.275
in the country coming after you.

28:06.309 --> 28:07.776
That's why you kidnapped
Richard's fiancée

28:07.811 --> 28:11.579
and extorted him
into downloading it for you.

28:11.614 --> 28:13.648
Then all you had to do
was put yourself in charge

28:13.683 --> 28:15.317
and you could steer
this investigation any direction

28:15.351 --> 28:16.819
you wanted.
Remind me again,

28:16.853 --> 28:20.322
whose idea was it to go
after that Nazi, Nathan Barlow?

28:20.356 --> 28:23.258
I didn't know Barlow was a C.I.
Richard didn't tell me.

28:23.293 --> 28:24.726
That's
because he didn't trust you.

28:24.760 --> 28:26.305
He knew that you were up to something.
No,

28:26.306 --> 28:28.807
that's 'cause Richard and I
stopped talking. And it's not

28:28.841 --> 28:30.397
what you think,
but I'm not proud of it.

28:30.421 --> 28:31.710
Look, you're about

28:31.711 --> 28:33.612
to be charged with murder.
I highly recommend

28:33.647 --> 28:35.648
you give us more than that.

28:37.083 --> 28:40.152
When Richard left me for Chloe,
I felt betrayed.

28:40.187 --> 28:42.655
We had a fight,
and I made threats.

28:42.689 --> 28:43.955
You threatened Richard?

28:43.990 --> 28:45.957
No.

28:45.992 --> 28:47.659
Chloe.

28:47.693 --> 28:49.327
Agent Miller,
I'm gonna have to ask you

28:49.361 --> 28:51.329
to hand over your weapon.

28:51.363 --> 28:53.764
We need to run it
for ballistics.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.715
Agent Miller's gun
isn't a match.

29:10.749 --> 29:13.218
BRENNAN: She could have just used another
gun and then destroyed it.

29:13.252 --> 29:16.321
It's what I would have done.
- It's possible.

29:16.355 --> 29:17.722
Aubrey's gonna keep holding
Miller

29:17.756 --> 29:19.056
until they search her apartment.

29:19.091 --> 29:20.291
I should return to my work.

29:20.326 --> 29:21.959
Arastoo is cataloging all

29:21.993 --> 29:24.028
of the blunt force trauma
injuries sustained by

29:24.062 --> 29:26.764
Agent Bannerman.
I'm glad you're back to trusting Arastoo.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.633
In a few years,

29:29.667 --> 29:32.870
I am sure he will be able to run

29:32.904 --> 29:36.040
a major forensic lab
such as this one.

29:36.074 --> 29:39.309
You just don't think
he's ready today?

29:40.311 --> 29:43.714
The Jeffersonian defines itself

29:43.749 --> 29:47.284
by only hiring
the most experienced,

29:47.318 --> 29:50.054
the... best in their field.

29:50.088 --> 29:52.790
Dr. Hodgins,
Angela, yourself...

29:54.259 --> 29:57.895
Which is why I am requesting
to have my job back.

29:59.965 --> 30:02.199
If Booth dies,

30:02.234 --> 30:05.236
then I think being here
would help.

30:05.270 --> 30:07.671
To have work to focus on,

30:07.705 --> 30:10.840
to... be surrounded by friends.

30:10.875 --> 30:13.843
This situation
has made me realize

30:13.878 --> 30:17.113
it was a mistake to quit.

30:17.148 --> 30:20.350
This is where I belong.

30:20.385 --> 30:22.286
We'll talk about this later.
I've just found

30:22.320 --> 30:24.721
something you need to see.

30:28.893 --> 30:31.328
As you know, the killer struck
the victim numerous times,

30:31.362 --> 30:34.731
which is why it took so long
to reconstruct the skull.

30:35.767 --> 30:38.034
No explanation necessary.

30:38.068 --> 30:39.969
Your reconstruction is flawless.

30:40.004 --> 30:42.306
Thank you. It occurred to me
the sheer number of strikes

30:42.340 --> 30:45.073
tells us the killer must have
felt great rage for the victim.

30:45.108 --> 30:47.843
Or the killer felt a surge
of adrenaline

30:47.877 --> 30:49.845
and was unable to stop.

30:49.879 --> 30:51.847
Such lack of control
is indicative

30:51.881 --> 30:53.482
of lack of experience.

30:53.517 --> 30:55.351
Agent Miller is highly trained.

30:55.385 --> 30:57.353
I'm seeing
multiple depression fractures.

30:57.387 --> 30:59.254
I've counted
16 of them.

30:59.289 --> 31:03.292
The depressions
are cylindrical.

31:03.327 --> 31:06.161
Dr. Hodgins swabbed the injuries
and found traces of steel.

31:06.196 --> 31:09.164
I'm thinking the murder weapon
could be a-a pipe.

31:09.199 --> 31:12.468
It wasn't a pipe. There's
a pattern to these fractures.

31:12.502 --> 31:15.137
Pattern?
It's very slight, but it's as if

31:15.171 --> 31:17.740
these depressions
are evenly spaced

31:17.774 --> 31:21.043
in groups of four.

31:23.046 --> 31:25.981
I think I know what it is.

31:26.015 --> 31:29.985
MONTENEGRO: So, these four depressions
are equidistant from each other.

31:30.019 --> 31:31.920
BRENNAN:
I'm confident these injuries

31:31.955 --> 31:33.388
were caused
by brass knuckles.

31:33.422 --> 31:36.959
But I thought Hodgins
found traces of steel.

31:36.993 --> 31:38.460
Contrary to their name,
brass knuckles

31:38.494 --> 31:40.963
are most commonly made
from steel.

31:40.997 --> 31:43.832
Oh. Okay.

31:45.001 --> 31:46.969
Whoa. Yeah.

31:47.003 --> 31:49.471
You're right.
They're an exact match.

31:49.505 --> 31:52.207
Do you want me to run
a force profile to see

31:52.242 --> 31:54.209
if Agent Miller could inflict
this level of damage?

31:54.244 --> 31:56.077
Agent Miller would never use
brass knuckles.

31:56.111 --> 31:58.312
When wearing brass knuckles,
you're telegraphing

31:58.347 --> 32:00.481
what hand
you'll be punching with.

32:00.515 --> 32:03.517
When using brass knuckles,
the force transfers directly

32:03.551 --> 32:06.520
to this area of the palm.

32:06.554 --> 32:09.523
Given the number of strikes
I observed,

32:09.557 --> 32:13.294
the killer must have fractured
his capitate or scaphoid.

32:13.328 --> 32:15.963
So we're looking for
a right-handed killer

32:15.998 --> 32:17.798
with a fractured hand

32:17.832 --> 32:20.935
who also knew Agent Bannerman
and Chloe Robertson.

32:20.969 --> 32:24.471
Benjamin Metzger
has a wrist injury.

32:25.840 --> 32:28.142
Oh, my God.

32:28.176 --> 32:30.310
He used me. He...

32:30.344 --> 32:32.412
he had me investigating
Agent Miller

32:32.446 --> 32:34.047
when it was really him.

32:36.550 --> 32:38.351
Come on, man. Talk to us. You've
been pacing around like that

32:38.386 --> 32:41.321
for the last hour.
I'm calling the deal off.

32:41.355 --> 32:42.121
What?

32:42.145 --> 32:43.623
BOOTH: W-Wait a second, Kevin,
you can't do that,

32:43.624 --> 32:45.926
okay? Jared died
so this deal could go down.

32:45.960 --> 32:49.095
Trust me, Seeley. You don't want
this. All right, listen up.

32:49.130 --> 32:51.423
This is what's gonna happen.
We're gonna take the $2 million,

32:51.424 --> 32:52.486
we're gonna split it even,

32:52.510 --> 32:53.233
and then we're gonna get
the hell out of here.

32:53.234 --> 32:54.968
No, no, no.
That wasn't the plan.

32:55.002 --> 32:58.038
You said we could buy the list
for two and sell it for 40.

32:58.072 --> 32:59.806
You said you had
the whole thing worked out.

32:59.840 --> 33:00.807
(grunts)

33:00.841 --> 33:03.842
Hey, don't!

33:03.876 --> 33:05.177
PETE:
Alex, grab the phone.

33:06.646 --> 33:09.014
(grunting)
PETE: Get the phone.

33:09.049 --> 33:10.182
Grab the phone, Alex.

33:10.216 --> 33:15.287
(grunting)

33:19.159 --> 33:20.492
What the hell?!

33:20.526 --> 33:21.517
Let go of me, Pete.

33:21.541 --> 33:22.061
No.
Let go!

33:22.062 --> 33:23.362
No!
- BOOTH: Take it easy.

33:23.396 --> 33:24.863
Everyone just think about

33:24.897 --> 33:26.298
what we're doing here,
all right?

33:26.333 --> 33:27.967
Kevin here is your CO.
Jared was one of you.

33:28.001 --> 33:28.968
You shut the hell up!

33:29.002 --> 33:30.202
I'm texting him

33:30.236 --> 33:32.571
that the deal's back on.

33:32.605 --> 33:36.341
Apparently, the only thing
keeping that from happening...

33:36.375 --> 33:38.509
is you.
- (gunshot)

33:38.543 --> 33:40.911
(grunting)

33:40.946 --> 33:43.014
(grunting continues)

33:46.452 --> 33:49.420
(grunting)

33:58.563 --> 34:00.365
I'll kill you, Booth!

34:03.102 --> 34:04.402
(grunts)

34:04.436 --> 34:06.069
Damn it!

34:06.104 --> 34:08.071
(grunts)

34:08.106 --> 34:10.172
You're a dead man, Booth!

34:10.208 --> 34:11.574
You hear me?

34:11.609 --> 34:12.609
You're dead!

34:14.800 --> 34:16.132
Think you can hide?

34:18.324 --> 34:20.059
I'm coming for you, Booth.

34:20.092 --> 34:22.293
(panting)

34:25.130 --> 34:26.866
I don't understand
why we're doing this.

34:26.900 --> 34:28.967
You killed my partner.
I killed no one.

34:29.002 --> 34:31.170
I've been nothing but helpful
to this investigation.

34:31.204 --> 34:32.839
AUBREY: You also killed
Chloe Robertson.

34:32.873 --> 34:34.907
You put a lot of good agents'
lives at risk.

34:34.940 --> 34:36.976
All for a two-million-dollar
payoff.

34:37.010 --> 34:39.746
You're questioning
the wrong person.

34:39.780 --> 34:42.181
Listen to me. You've got
one chance to save your life.

34:42.215 --> 34:43.815
You lead us to Booth,

34:43.851 --> 34:45.251
and we won't press
for the death penalty.

34:45.284 --> 34:47.687
Where were you meeting
to sell the list?

34:47.721 --> 34:50.322
I told you I'm innocent.

34:50.357 --> 34:53.826
This isn't the first time
you've made that mistake, is it?

34:57.063 --> 34:59.098
This isn't working.
I've seen this before.

34:59.132 --> 35:01.800
They're good. They'll find the
right button. Just give it time.

35:01.834 --> 35:03.102
Booth doesn't have time.

35:03.136 --> 35:05.437
<i>Cher,</i> you can't go in there.

35:05.471 --> 35:07.273
(sighs)

35:07.307 --> 35:09.808
(door closes)

35:11.278 --> 35:12.744
METZGER: My record speaks
for itself.

35:12.779 --> 35:14.079
Dr. Brennan,
what are you doing here?

35:14.114 --> 35:15.915
I can help.
I know how to make him talk.

35:15.949 --> 35:18.350
Do it.
- You lied about your hand.

35:18.385 --> 35:21.086
You broke it when you brutally
murdered Richard Bannerman.

35:21.121 --> 35:22.854
This has gone too far.
I have tried to cooperate.

35:22.889 --> 35:24.856
Aah! God!

35:24.891 --> 35:26.458
Tell me where Booth is <i>now.</i>

35:26.492 --> 35:28.460
Stop. Okay.
Okay, okay.

35:28.494 --> 35:30.896
Stop. (groaning)

35:33.099 --> 35:35.367
PETE:
There's no escape!

35:35.402 --> 35:39.771
This door can't
hold out forever.

35:41.907 --> 35:44.242
(panting)

35:45.411 --> 35:47.745
You're a dead man, Booth!

35:47.779 --> 35:49.213
Oh, you're dead!

35:49.248 --> 35:52.917
Oh.

35:52.952 --> 35:55.219
(grunts)

36:00.826 --> 36:03.161
(panting)

36:07.199 --> 36:11.002
You... son of a bitch.

36:16.241 --> 36:18.742
(panting)

36:18.777 --> 36:21.846
(siren approaching)

36:21.880 --> 36:25.882
(indistinct crowd chatter,
sirens blaring)

36:30.821 --> 36:32.289
Dr. Brennan, you
need to wait here.

36:32.323 --> 36:34.091
No, I'm going inside.

36:34.125 --> 36:35.859
(door squeaks open)

36:35.893 --> 36:37.160
Hold up!

36:38.829 --> 36:40.097
Someone's coming out.

36:41.832 --> 36:44.001
(groaning and panting)

36:45.069 --> 36:46.470
Booth!
- Bones.

36:46.504 --> 36:49.239
I'm okay. I know.
It's just a scratch.

36:49.273 --> 36:51.308
Oh.
- (panting)

36:51.342 --> 36:52.909
You okay?

36:52.943 --> 36:54.911
Yeah. Oh. Oh!
I got you. I got you.

36:54.945 --> 36:57.513
I got you. I got you.
- So good.

36:57.547 --> 36:59.781
You're gonna be okay.

36:59.816 --> 37:01.817
I got you.

37:22.439 --> 37:24.240
It's been two hours
and ten minutes

37:24.274 --> 37:26.042
since Booth went in
for surgery.

37:26.076 --> 37:28.044
Reminding us every five minutes
isn't gonna help.

37:28.078 --> 37:30.978
(sighs)
I just feel so useless.

37:31.013 --> 37:32.514
Hey, Brennan just called.
Booth's out of surgery,

37:32.548 --> 37:34.015
and he's gonna make it.

37:34.050 --> 37:36.251
HODGINS: Yes! Okay.
(sighs with relief)

37:36.285 --> 37:38.520
All right, I'm making drinks.
Who wants what?

37:38.554 --> 37:40.255
No, no. You're
coming with me.

37:40.289 --> 37:41.989
We're gonna pick up
Christine and little Hank,

37:42.024 --> 37:43.458
and we're hosting
a sleepover.

37:43.492 --> 37:45.927
Yeah. Yeah, that sounds nice.

37:45.961 --> 37:47.362
The more kids the merrier.

37:47.396 --> 37:49.097
Oh. Be careful what you say.

37:49.131 --> 37:50.498
You might give me ideas.

37:50.533 --> 37:53.034
(Hodgins laughs)

37:59.275 --> 38:02.277
Any chance we could
do this tomorrow?

38:02.311 --> 38:06.114
I'm afraid if we don't do it
now, I won't say what I need to.

38:09.217 --> 38:12.086
Arastoo, look at me.

38:12.120 --> 38:14.855
Please... don't do this.

38:14.890 --> 38:16.290
I love you.

38:16.324 --> 38:18.626
I love you, too.

38:18.660 --> 38:21.261
But I have to move on.

38:21.296 --> 38:23.497
I can't just stay
here as an intern.

38:23.531 --> 38:27.868
If you propose to me right now,
I promise I'll say yes.

38:27.903 --> 38:30.905
Then what?

38:30.939 --> 38:33.207
Would you follow me to Ottawa,

38:33.241 --> 38:35.542
to Cincinnati, to Dubai?

38:35.577 --> 38:37.645
Because those are
the job opportunities

38:37.679 --> 38:39.680
I'll be applying for.

38:39.715 --> 38:43.217
I've never been to Dubai.

38:43.251 --> 38:45.552
(laughs)

38:45.587 --> 38:48.088
It's hot.

38:48.123 --> 38:50.724
And it's not the Jeffersonian.

38:53.628 --> 38:56.196
And I think if you went,

38:56.231 --> 38:59.633
you would resent me for
the rest of our lives.

39:02.203 --> 39:05.038
And I don't want to resent you.

39:19.053 --> 39:21.354
AUBREY:
<i>So,</i>

39:21.388 --> 39:22.989
you think
there'll be any fallout

39:23.024 --> 39:25.158
because Brennan assaulted our killer?
- Sure.

39:25.192 --> 39:27.093
They'll be reducing
his sentence

39:27.128 --> 39:28.928
from 900 years to 600 years.

39:28.963 --> 39:30.296
I can live with that.
(knocking)

39:30.330 --> 39:32.632
Hey.

39:32.667 --> 39:34.968
I'm leaving.

39:35.002 --> 39:36.469
Just wanted to
say thank you.

39:36.503 --> 39:39.238
Oh. Okay.

39:39.273 --> 39:41.374
Wow! Look at that, huh?

39:41.408 --> 39:43.109
It's very nice of you.

39:43.144 --> 39:45.979
Especially since
I accused you of murder.

39:46.013 --> 39:47.647
Well, you did
what you had to do.

39:47.682 --> 39:49.549
You found
Richard's killer.

39:49.583 --> 39:52.051
Can I, uh...

39:52.085 --> 39:54.486
can I pour you a drink?

39:54.520 --> 39:56.454
No. I should get going.

39:58.024 --> 40:00.693
I'll see you around.

40:02.495 --> 40:04.329
"Old Foglesong."

40:04.363 --> 40:06.531
If there's a cheaper whiskey,
I haven't heard of it.

40:06.566 --> 40:08.033
Oh, no.

40:08.068 --> 40:10.102
She, uh... she did her homework.

40:10.136 --> 40:12.137
This happens
to be my favorite.

40:12.172 --> 40:14.506
Smart girl.

40:14.540 --> 40:16.341
She knows who to make nice to.

40:16.375 --> 40:19.110
What? What are you
talking about? I'm nobody.

40:19.144 --> 40:21.145
People are talking, <i>cher.</i>

40:21.180 --> 40:22.714
You just wait.

40:22.748 --> 40:26.584
Well, then, here's to waiting.

40:29.121 --> 40:32.090
(groaning, spitting)

40:32.124 --> 40:33.725
Smooth.

40:33.759 --> 40:36.260
(exhales)

40:39.464 --> 40:41.766
BRENNAN:
<i>Christine and Hank</i>

40:41.800 --> 40:44.335
are with Hodgins
and Angela tonight.

40:44.369 --> 40:46.838
I... I'll bring them by
in the morning if...

40:46.872 --> 40:48.538
if you're up to it.

40:48.572 --> 40:50.673
(medical monitor beeping)
I will. I will be.

40:50.708 --> 40:52.375
(gasps)
- Do you want something?

40:52.409 --> 40:54.111
No, I got it.
I got the water.

40:54.145 --> 40:57.781
Oh! Thanks for the pictures
that you brought.

40:57.815 --> 41:00.550
I also brought this one.

41:02.620 --> 41:05.756
I wasn't sure if you
would want it, though.

41:05.790 --> 41:08.291
Take this.
- Oh.

41:16.567 --> 41:20.370
(voice breaking): That was taken
at Jared's ninth birthday.

41:20.404 --> 41:23.239
I'm so sorry, Booth.

41:23.274 --> 41:26.108
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

41:26.143 --> 41:28.110
I just...
should have told you the truth.

41:28.145 --> 41:29.612
I didn't.

41:29.647 --> 41:31.648
You have no need
to apologize.

41:31.682 --> 41:33.816
You did what you
felt was necessary

41:33.850 --> 41:36.486
in order to try and
save your brother.

41:36.520 --> 41:38.321
You're incredible.

41:38.355 --> 41:41.257
You know that?
You really are incredible.

41:43.360 --> 41:45.662
I want you to know

41:45.696 --> 41:49.164
that I'm going back to my
old job at the Jeffersonian.

41:49.198 --> 41:52.167
I think you should go
back to yours, as well.

41:52.201 --> 41:53.602
Time out.

41:53.636 --> 41:55.404
We can't do that.
You know that?

41:55.438 --> 41:57.439
Listen, we both decided

41:57.473 --> 42:00.475
that we were gonna stop
doing this together, okay?

42:00.510 --> 42:02.644
We quit our jobs. We're done.

42:02.679 --> 42:04.413
If you're done, Booth,

42:04.447 --> 42:06.848
why am I sitting with
you in a hospital room?

42:08.685 --> 42:10.652
You've always done this.

42:10.687 --> 42:13.789
Risked your life for
the sake of others.

42:13.823 --> 42:15.824
The army,

42:15.858 --> 42:17.926
the FBI.
- I can change.

42:17.960 --> 42:20.795
I don't want you to.

42:20.830 --> 42:23.631
Booth, you are the bravest,

42:23.665 --> 42:26.301
most selfless man
I have ever met.

42:26.335 --> 42:29.670
And as much as I hate
seeing you here in pain

42:29.705 --> 42:32.440
and suffering,

42:32.474 --> 42:34.775
I also know this is...

42:34.810 --> 42:37.912
who you genuinely are.

42:40.682 --> 42:42.717
Now, this doesn't mean

42:42.751 --> 42:45.386
you are allowed to be
reckless, do you understand?

42:45.420 --> 42:47.655
Me?
- You do not

42:47.689 --> 42:49.623
have permission
to die on me, okay?

42:49.658 --> 42:51.625
Oh, God, you really are
incredible.

42:51.660 --> 42:52.960
You already said that.

42:52.994 --> 42:54.395
Well, you know, I lost a lot

42:54.429 --> 42:56.397
of blood here, Bones--
at least half.

42:56.431 --> 42:59.946
Not half. Two-fifths at most.
That's a lot. Can I get the water?

43:00.046 --> 43:01.681
Sure.
- That's a lot of blood.

43:01.715 --> 43:04.149
Okay, but it wasn't half.
It was pouring out of me.
