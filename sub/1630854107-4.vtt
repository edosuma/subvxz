WEBVTT

00:08.376 --> 00:10.611
30 years ago

00:10.711 --> 00:15.049
on a cool autumn night,
just like this one,

00:15.149 --> 00:17.085
a group of friends,

00:17.185 --> 00:18.686
like you kind folk,

00:18.786 --> 00:22.590
got tucked into sleeping bags
for a peaceful night's rest.

00:22.690 --> 00:27.928
Little did they know,
they were not alone.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.463
For in these woods,

00:29.563 --> 00:31.599
the devil had emerged
from his den,

00:31.699 --> 00:34.902
and he was hungry.

00:35.002 --> 00:37.338
And this beast,

00:37.438 --> 00:39.373
the Cujo of black bears,

00:39.473 --> 00:41.275
sated himself

00:41.375 --> 00:42.476
that night

00:42.576 --> 00:44.245
on human flesh.

00:44.345 --> 00:46.780
Nature's calling.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.383
Even today, we're getting
reports of an erratic bear

00:49.483 --> 00:51.285
traipsing through the woods.

01:10.271 --> 01:13.874
So, keep your bear spray close.

01:18.379 --> 01:19.947
What happened?

01:20.047 --> 01:21.282
Are you okay?

02:01.855 --> 02:04.658
Don't be disappointed.
It all goes to a worthy cause.

02:04.758 --> 02:07.027
Yeah, well, what I donated
was worth a lot more

02:07.127 --> 02:08.362
than what it got.

02:08.462 --> 02:09.997
Good morning, fellas. Yeah.

02:10.097 --> 02:12.132
Oh, Nick, sounds like
you need this coffee

02:12.233 --> 02:13.467
a lot more than I do.

02:13.567 --> 02:14.802
Yeah, Nick joined me last night

02:14.902 --> 02:16.437
at Victoria's autumn auction.

02:16.537 --> 02:17.971
In fact, he donated one
of the prizes.

02:18.071 --> 02:19.207
Not just a prize.

02:19.307 --> 02:21.242
The best prize.
Which was?

02:21.342 --> 02:23.977
Lunch with a badass NCIS agent.

02:24.077 --> 02:25.746
And they only
bid ten bucks.

02:25.846 --> 02:28.582
And the dude already emailed me
trying to set something up.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.584
The winning parent was,
uh, Max Lautner?

02:30.684 --> 02:32.420
You know him?

02:32.520 --> 02:35.456
I know his kid, Cole,
is a nose-picker.

02:35.556 --> 02:37.558
Ugh. Dad's gonna be
super annoying.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.393
Kind of like McGee's
school-dad friends.

02:39.493 --> 02:42.596
Hey, no need to drag my dad-bros
into your failure as a prize.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.498
Okay, that's enough
from you, all right?

02:44.598 --> 02:46.334
Fortunately,
I had much better luck.

02:46.434 --> 02:48.669
I scored a deluxe spa weekend

02:48.769 --> 02:50.304
at this adorable
little B&B in the Chesapeake.

02:50.404 --> 02:54.508
Someone say "spa weekend"?
'Cause sea-salt scrubs?

02:54.608 --> 02:56.810
Mmm.
I have always wanted one
of those.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.449
Yeah, um, could you...?

03:01.549 --> 03:03.451
Come here. Can you
come... come here?

03:03.551 --> 03:05.085
They know we all know, right?

03:05.185 --> 03:06.620
Know what?

03:06.720 --> 03:08.456
That's good. Mm-hmm.
Right?

03:08.556 --> 03:10.023
Yeah, so, hey, uh,
we've been date...

03:10.123 --> 03:13.327
We've been doing this
for a few months now.

03:13.427 --> 03:15.329
Yes. This. We have.

03:15.429 --> 03:16.497
Successfully, I think.

03:16.597 --> 03:19.032
Successful is an apt word.

03:19.132 --> 03:22.035
And I don't know
what our label is or isn't, but

03:22.135 --> 03:24.372
I was hoping that you might
join me at this place.

03:24.472 --> 03:25.939
No pressure, though, so...

03:26.039 --> 03:28.609
Like a... like a...
a weekend away?

03:28.709 --> 03:31.845
Like a whole, two-day,

03:31.945 --> 03:34.315
entire weekend.
You're mulling.

03:34.415 --> 03:36.750
I... I am mulling.

03:36.850 --> 03:39.119
Is this a good mulling
or a bad mulling...?

03:39.920 --> 03:42.290
Oh. Parker's got a body.

03:42.390 --> 03:44.958
Um, talk about this later?

03:45.058 --> 03:46.560
Yes.
Okay.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.896
And I will...
I will keep mulling.

03:56.504 --> 03:58.138
Oh. You get lost on the trail?

03:58.238 --> 04:01.375
Nah. Just delayed. Couldn't find
my, uh, 500-millimeter lens.

04:01.475 --> 04:04.678
You, uh, do know our crime scene
kits have these in 'em, right?

04:04.778 --> 04:06.680
Oh, this baby's not meant
to shoot bodies.

04:06.780 --> 04:09.283
It's meant
to shoot the rarest of birds.

04:09.383 --> 04:11.118
The elusive scarlet tanager.

04:11.218 --> 04:12.586
They live high
in the trees here

04:12.686 --> 04:14.221
in the Shenandoah, and today

04:14.322 --> 04:16.524
is the day that I digitally

04:16.624 --> 04:18.992
bag one. Yeah.

04:20.193 --> 04:23.397
But not until we get our
sailor here taken care of.

04:23.497 --> 04:26.867
Petty Officer Third Class
Aaron Thomas. What do we know?

04:26.967 --> 04:29.537
Camper and her guide
stumbled across the body.

04:29.637 --> 04:31.605
Guide is convinced
it was a bear attack.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.541
Apparently,
in the last 24 hours,

04:33.641 --> 04:36.710
there's been multiple sightings
of a black bear behaving oddly.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.512
:
Oddly how, Boo-Boo?

04:38.612 --> 04:40.781
Like stealing
a pic-a-nic basket?

04:40.881 --> 04:42.350
Well, in order
to get away with murder,

04:42.450 --> 04:45.052
he'd have to be smarter
than the av-er-age bear.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.989
No, but bears do, do their
business out there in the woods.

04:49.089 --> 04:51.359
They don't open
bathroom doors, nor

04:51.459 --> 04:52.760
do they kill with knives.

04:52.860 --> 04:55.663
So our petty officer
was stabbed to death?

04:55.763 --> 04:58.231
Three precise stab wounds

04:58.332 --> 04:59.933
at three key arteries.

05:00.033 --> 05:02.169
He bled out about 12 hours ago.

05:02.269 --> 05:05.238
And... no defensive wounds.

05:05.339 --> 05:07.375
So our victim might have known
his killer.

05:07.475 --> 05:08.876
Or was surprised by 'em.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.844
So our killer certainly knew
how to use a knife.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.846
Could be a hunter.

05:13.747 --> 05:14.948
All right, thanks, Doc.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.817
Yeah.

05:19.319 --> 05:22.022
Park rangers are talking
to the campers, but

05:22.122 --> 05:23.591
they didn't see anyone
on the trail.

05:23.691 --> 05:26.460
So our suspect left
the scene off-trail,

05:26.560 --> 05:27.961
which means
he could have gone anywhere.

05:28.061 --> 05:29.997
I think he headed southeast.

05:31.899 --> 05:34.602
Spotted a possible exit route
from up there.

05:35.436 --> 05:39.607
Any chance you also spotted
a scarlet tanager?

05:39.707 --> 05:42.109
No, but the trail leads
this way.

05:42.209 --> 05:46.279
Go. I'll coordinate with the
Park Service Rangers on-site.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.281
And stay out of the trees!

05:49.850 --> 05:52.786
The trail's leading
down to the water.

06:05.899 --> 06:08.335
About time you caught up, Tripsie.

06:09.603 --> 06:11.104
Knight, you know this guy?

06:11.204 --> 06:13.641
Yeah, we may have crossed paths
a few times.

06:13.741 --> 06:15.075
This is, uh,

06:15.175 --> 06:16.610
Special Agent
Gage Winchester.

06:16.710 --> 06:19.146
Crossed paths? Really?

06:20.614 --> 06:23.684
He's also my ex-boyfriend.

06:34.528 --> 06:35.929
Been a long time, Jess.

06:36.029 --> 06:39.733
Yeah. What's it been?
Like, three, four years?

06:39.833 --> 06:41.969
Howled at half a dozen
wolf moons without you,

06:42.069 --> 06:43.637
but who's counting?

06:45.973 --> 06:49.176
So you are Agent
Winchester of the, uh...?

06:49.276 --> 06:52.546
U.S. National Park Service
Investigative Services Branch.

06:52.646 --> 06:56.383
Uh, ISB is the us
of National Park Service.

06:56.484 --> 06:58.018
Oh, nature cops.

06:58.118 --> 06:59.052
That's cool.

06:59.152 --> 07:00.387
Well, I'm Agent McGee,

07:00.488 --> 07:02.122
and this is Agent Torres.

07:02.222 --> 07:04.057
Yeah, can I interest you
in a shirt?

07:04.157 --> 07:06.026
Perhaps, uh, some pants?

07:06.126 --> 07:08.629
Nah. Prefer to air-dry first.

07:08.729 --> 07:10.330
Of course you do.
Mm-hmm.

07:10.430 --> 07:13.467
Uh, what are you
doing here, Gage?

07:13.567 --> 07:16.904
Same thing you are--
investigating a murder.

07:17.004 --> 07:18.639
I thought
you were based in Colorado.

07:18.739 --> 07:21.441
I am, but I was running
a training op up in Maine.

07:21.542 --> 07:23.644
When I heard about the body,
I hopped on a redeye

07:23.744 --> 07:25.679
so I could start
the ISB investigation.

07:25.779 --> 07:29.550
So you flew overnight to be
the first one on the scene here?

07:29.650 --> 07:31.852
And spotted the same path
the killer took down here.

07:31.952 --> 07:34.488
How'd you end up
in the water?
Yeah, naked.

07:34.588 --> 07:37.090
Well, trail went cold,
and I was smelling a little ripe

07:37.190 --> 07:39.960
after that flight, so I hopped
in for a quick nature bath

07:40.060 --> 07:41.294
just as you caught up.

07:41.394 --> 07:43.964
As one does.
Yeah. No. It makes sense to me.

07:44.064 --> 07:45.966
Hey, guys. I need your official
signature to release the body.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.300
That's not a dead body.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.502
That's a very
healthy-looking body.

07:48.602 --> 07:49.770
Whose body is that body?

07:49.870 --> 07:51.672
Uh, Jimmy, this...
Uh, Dr. Palmer,

07:51.772 --> 07:54.608
this is, uh,
Agent Winchester.

07:54.708 --> 07:55.442
Oh.

07:55.543 --> 07:57.511
Gage... Winchester.

07:57.611 --> 08:00.848
Of National Park Service.
Good to meet you, Doctor.

08:00.948 --> 08:02.916
Yeah.
McGEE: You know,
Jimmy, funny thing.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.451
Uh, Gage and Knight
actually know each other.

08:04.552 --> 08:06.019
Yeah, actually,
quite, uh...

08:06.119 --> 08:07.555
quite close.

08:07.655 --> 08:08.922
And we are just dying
to get the full scoop here.

08:09.022 --> 08:10.090
We are, yeah.

08:10.190 --> 08:11.559
Right.

08:11.659 --> 08:13.627
Jimmy, Gage is my ex-boyfriend.

08:13.727 --> 08:16.363
Oh. What a small world
of federal agents.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.298
You two met how?

08:18.398 --> 08:20.734
At FLETC training
in New Mexico.

08:20.834 --> 08:25.539
You know, we would, uh, spend
weekends together... camping.

08:25.639 --> 08:27.474
And then, you know, we had
a couple of years of...

08:27.575 --> 08:29.076
of long-distance
relationship, but you know,

08:29.176 --> 08:31.111
our assignments would just
keep us apart.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.714
<i>Your</i> assignment.

08:33.814 --> 08:36.383
We were accepted to be
Rangers together, but, uh,

08:36.483 --> 08:38.719
Jess turned down their offer
to join NCIS.

08:38.819 --> 08:41.354
Which is why we are here--
because

08:41.454 --> 08:43.156
there is a dead
petty officer.

08:43.256 --> 08:45.092
Why send the ISB
to investigate?

08:45.192 --> 08:48.528
There's been a recent uptick
in homicides in national parks.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.931
My superiors are looking
for answers.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.399
How many murders and where?

08:52.499 --> 08:54.501
The Everglades,
the Great Smoky Mountains,

08:54.602 --> 08:56.503
and now here in Shenandoah.

08:56.604 --> 08:57.905
Three victims
in eight weeks.

08:58.005 --> 08:59.707
You're thinking
that they're all connected?

08:59.807 --> 09:03.811
No idea. We haven't been able
to solve one yet.

09:05.345 --> 09:07.447
Come on, Tripsie.

09:07.547 --> 09:08.716
You and I together again?

09:08.816 --> 09:10.618
I know we can find
this killer's trail.

09:10.718 --> 09:12.753
Who's Tripsie?
Sorry. It's an

09:12.853 --> 09:14.755
old nickname I had for Jess.

09:14.855 --> 09:17.024
Oh, you had nicknames.
How cute.

09:17.124 --> 09:19.559
Uh, well, you know,
Ga-Gage isn't wrong.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.394
If we find
the killer's

09:21.494 --> 09:22.763
exit route,
then we might be able

09:22.863 --> 09:24.297
to find some clues
about their identity.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.766
All right, well,
we'll head back and, uh,

09:25.866 --> 09:27.400
start digging into
Petty Officer Thomas.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.469
Yeah, yeah, and
I'll-I'll see you later, Gage.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.673
I'll see what I get off
the body back at autopsy.

09:36.476 --> 09:38.045
Let's go, Tripsie.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.352
Victim is Petty Officer
Aaron Thomas,

09:45.452 --> 09:49.556
23 years old, served as a
gunner's mate on the USS <i>Mahan.</i>

09:49.657 --> 09:50.924
What was he doing
out at the park?

09:51.024 --> 09:53.393
C.O. said he was an avid
outdoor enthusiast.

09:53.493 --> 09:54.527
If he wasn't on the ship,

09:54.628 --> 09:56.096
he was building campfires.

09:56.196 --> 09:57.798
He go out there with anyone?

09:57.898 --> 10:00.500
Bunkmates said
he preferred camping alone.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.703
Two dozen sailors crammed
into a single berth?

10:02.803 --> 10:04.437
I'd want a little me-time, too.

10:04.537 --> 10:07.207
Well, Thomas's minimal security
clearance gave him no access

10:07.307 --> 10:08.541
to vital intel.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.543
So, it's unlikely
that he was targeted

10:10.644 --> 10:12.345
because of his job
in the Navy.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.881
Why was he killed?

10:13.981 --> 10:16.016
And why was he killed in
the middle of a national park?

10:16.116 --> 10:18.385
No one around for miles
to catch 'em in the act.

10:18.485 --> 10:19.787
All right, Torres,
start with this.

10:19.887 --> 10:21.288
Who was in that park
in the last 72 hours.

10:21.388 --> 10:22.622
McGee, license plates,

10:22.723 --> 10:23.924
credit cards, anything

10:24.024 --> 10:25.492
to give us IDs
that we can cull.

10:25.592 --> 10:27.895
Gentlemen, I just
got off the phone with

10:27.995 --> 10:29.663
my counterpart
at the National Parks Service.

10:29.763 --> 10:31.832
What did the, uh,
flat hat brigade want?

10:31.932 --> 10:34.034
To team up,
and since their man was first

10:34.134 --> 10:35.435
to the scene, I agreed.

10:35.535 --> 10:37.204
So, now, this is
a joint investigation

10:37.304 --> 10:39.239
with ISB Agent Winchester.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.108
But it's a Navy victim!

10:41.208 --> 10:43.043
No. No. No way, man.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.244
You tell the NPS

10:44.344 --> 10:46.880
to back off
and let us do what we do.

10:47.681 --> 10:49.683
Is there going
to be a problem, Agent Parker?

10:49.783 --> 10:51.184
Look, it's just that, uh, me

10:51.284 --> 10:55.188
and the NPS haven't always
seen eye-to-eye.

10:55.288 --> 10:57.290
About what?
About a mild

10:57.390 --> 10:58.658
trespassing allegation.

10:58.759 --> 11:01.094
Define "mild."
Golden Gate National Park,

11:01.194 --> 11:02.763
summer 2016.

11:02.863 --> 11:06.767
It was the biggest western snowy
plover mating season in years.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.635
Snowy what?
Bird-nerd alert.

11:08.736 --> 11:10.370
Maybe I climbed a fence

11:10.470 --> 11:13.907
with a "Do Not Climb" sign to
get a shot of the nesting area,

11:14.007 --> 11:15.909
but this was one
for my wall, okay?

11:16.009 --> 11:18.211
You understand?
This was a framer.

11:18.311 --> 11:20.213
Yeah, until you got caught
by the NPS.

11:20.313 --> 11:22.816
And put on a list.
All right, well, you cooperate

11:22.916 --> 11:24.151
with Agent Winchester
on this case,

11:24.251 --> 11:25.652
and maybe
we can get you off that list.

11:25.753 --> 11:27.487
Agent Knight is out now
at the park

11:27.587 --> 11:31.024
with her ISB ex-boyfriend trying
to track the killer's trail.

11:31.124 --> 11:32.659
Rewind.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.127
Agent Knight
had some kind of

11:34.227 --> 11:36.129
previous personal relation
to Agent Winchester?

11:36.229 --> 11:38.365
You need us
to define "personal"?

11:38.465 --> 11:39.466
Does Palmer know?

11:39.566 --> 11:40.700
Oh, yeah.

11:40.801 --> 11:42.602
Is that gonna be a problem?

11:42.702 --> 11:44.104
Well, let me put it like this.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.606
Uh, I know each
of Delilah's exes.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.008
No problems there, but

11:48.108 --> 11:50.243
if Gage Winchester
was one of 'em?

11:50.343 --> 11:52.279
Yeah, she could keep that one
to herself.

11:52.379 --> 11:53.881
Then somebody
should give the good doctor

11:53.981 --> 11:55.415
a heads-up
that we'll be seeing a lot more

11:55.515 --> 11:57.084
of Agent Winchester.

12:01.354 --> 12:02.655
I don't understand the issue.

12:02.756 --> 12:04.357
Well, I could push back
a little harder.

12:04.457 --> 12:07.895
The two of them working together
is a clear conflict of interest.

12:07.995 --> 12:09.830
Was it a conflict
of interest

12:09.930 --> 12:12.632
when you were working with
your ex-wife three months ago?

12:13.767 --> 12:15.869
Uh, look,
from what I understand,

12:15.969 --> 12:17.971
Agent Winchester
has a unique skill set

12:18.071 --> 12:20.207
that will really aid
in this investigation.

12:20.307 --> 12:21.608
The fact that he and Knight

12:21.708 --> 12:23.143
were...

12:23.977 --> 12:26.013
...camping together--
that doesn't bother you?

12:26.113 --> 12:29.950
Why would them camping together
a lifetime ago bother me?

12:30.050 --> 12:32.752
I don't mean
camping-camping. I mean...

12:32.853 --> 12:34.354
I know what you meant,

12:34.454 --> 12:35.823
but Agents Knight and Winchester
are trained professionals.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.357
I'll trust they'll keep things

12:37.457 --> 12:38.892
professional
out in the field.

12:38.992 --> 12:41.862
Just like you and Knight
keep things professional here.

12:41.962 --> 12:44.497
Let's move on to my report.

12:44.597 --> 12:48.435
Well, definitely not
bear claw marks.

12:48.535 --> 12:51.071
A four-inch hunting blade
severed the carotid artery,

12:51.171 --> 12:53.773
the femoral artery, as well
as the inferior vena cava

12:53.874 --> 12:55.308
deep inside of his abdomen.

12:55.408 --> 12:57.945
Exsanguination would have
occurred within minutes.

12:58.045 --> 12:59.679
Killer bled him out efficiently.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.015
The attacker was
six-foot, six-foot-two

13:02.115 --> 13:03.616
based on the angle
of the wounds.

13:03.716 --> 13:05.018
Can we trace the knife?

13:05.118 --> 13:06.920
A four-inch blade
is far too common

13:07.020 --> 13:08.655
to narrow it down
to a make and model.

13:08.755 --> 13:10.057
However...
Ooh.

13:10.157 --> 13:11.925
Can't sneeze
at a good "however."

13:12.025 --> 13:16.063
The expert lethality of the
wounds really got me thinking.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.198
Ah, these are
the other park murders

13:18.298 --> 13:19.933
Winchester was looking into.

13:20.033 --> 13:23.203
Right. The Everglades victim
was barbecued in a campfire,

13:23.303 --> 13:26.339
while the Smoky Mountains victim
was shoved off of a cliff.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.175
Gross. And grosser.

13:28.275 --> 13:29.776
I think I might have
found something

13:29.877 --> 13:31.845
the other M.E.s may
have overlooked,

13:31.945 --> 13:33.180
probably because of the severity

13:33.280 --> 13:34.781
of the wounds
to the victims' bodies.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.884
But I think these injuries...

13:36.984 --> 13:39.652
were covering up
other wounds.

13:40.653 --> 13:44.091
I think each one
of these is a stab wound.

13:44.191 --> 13:46.927
Each one of them hit
a major artery.

13:47.027 --> 13:48.528
Each with a four-inch blade.

13:48.628 --> 13:50.030
Just like our victim.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.032
Yeah, I had Kasie scan all
of these photos

13:52.132 --> 13:54.634
to render a 3D composite image.

13:55.735 --> 13:59.572
Now, the angle
of the wound would suggest

13:59.672 --> 14:02.009
a six-foot-ish attacker.

14:02.109 --> 14:04.744
Same M.O.
Could be the same person.

14:04.844 --> 14:08.215
Which would mean that we have
a serial killer who's hunting

14:08.315 --> 14:10.383
in our national parks.

14:12.419 --> 14:15.688
Mmm. I forgot what
fresh smells like.

14:15.788 --> 14:18.391
Don't tell me this NCIS
posting's turned you city.

14:18.491 --> 14:22.362
Let's just say that I am
no longer opposed to certain

14:22.462 --> 14:23.897
urban creature comforts.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.265
Like?

14:25.365 --> 14:26.967
Endless hot showers,

14:27.067 --> 14:30.037
or 2:00 a.m. Kabob
Palace delivery. Mmm.

14:30.137 --> 14:33.240
Long gone are the days of you
catching your own dinner, huh?

14:33.340 --> 14:35.042
Just because I don't,
doesn't mean I can't.

14:35.142 --> 14:37.277
It's not like it's a skill
that you for...

14:37.377 --> 14:39.179
Paw prints.

14:39.279 --> 14:42.115
Black bear.
Guessing an adult male.

14:42.916 --> 14:45.986
Except the palm pad
isn't uniform.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.854
It's like there's a second print
on the inside.

14:47.955 --> 14:49.822
Clean oval shape.

14:49.923 --> 14:51.191
It's a shoe.

14:51.291 --> 14:53.493
Someone is stepping
in the bear prints,

14:53.593 --> 14:55.495
using it to mask their own.

14:55.595 --> 14:56.896
That has to be our suspect.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.898
Then we follow the bear.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.867
Guess you haven't gone city
after all.

15:04.938 --> 15:07.640
Let's just hope this isn't
a Yellowstone repeat.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.342
That moose attacked me unprovoked.

15:09.442 --> 15:10.978
It was courting a cow.

15:11.078 --> 15:13.713
It did not need you peeping
on its mating ritual.

15:13.813 --> 15:16.049
We certainly had
some adventures together.

15:17.317 --> 15:19.019
Definitely was hoping
we'd have more.

15:19.119 --> 15:21.088
Simmer down there, Moosie.

15:21.188 --> 15:23.323
It's easy to remember
the good times first.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.592
We did have our share
of the not-so-good.

15:25.692 --> 15:28.295
Yeah.
Most of those were on me.

15:29.129 --> 15:31.031
Takes two to tango.

15:31.131 --> 15:33.166
And I stepped
on your toes plenty.

15:33.266 --> 15:37.804
Still, I wasn't easy to be with
when I was a younger man,

15:37.904 --> 15:40.307
but I'm not that same man now.

15:40.407 --> 15:42.209
I hope that's true.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.844
For your own happiness.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.380
I am happy,
but call me Pinocchio

15:47.480 --> 15:49.416
if there ain't
something missing.

15:52.752 --> 15:55.188
Whoa.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.395
Thanks.

16:02.495 --> 16:04.864
Sure.

16:09.569 --> 16:11.238
That's smoke.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.806
There aren't any
campsites out here.

16:19.312 --> 16:22.315
Damn it.
We must've just missed him.

16:24.084 --> 16:26.919
Yeah, maybe he heard us
and decided to run.

16:28.155 --> 16:29.889
Burned some evidence.

16:34.561 --> 16:36.029
Nice save.

16:38.031 --> 16:39.699
Got something.

16:39.799 --> 16:41.734
Anything good?

16:41.834 --> 16:43.903
Looks like a map of the park.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.139
What the hell?
What is it?

16:46.239 --> 16:48.141
It's you.

16:55.315 --> 16:58.885
Why does our murder suspect
have your photo?

17:09.496 --> 17:11.198
You can't kick me off
this investigation!

17:11.298 --> 17:13.533
We're not, but you might be
a potential target

17:13.633 --> 17:15.068
so you are
to remain in this building,

17:15.168 --> 17:17.637
and you will support
Agent Parker's team from here.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.106
Thanks to you
and Knight's quick work,

17:19.206 --> 17:21.641
we've got some evidence
from that fire we can process.

17:21.741 --> 17:25.212
Hopefully, we can get an ID
on who tried to destroy it.

17:25.312 --> 17:26.613
If you want
to find this guy,

17:26.713 --> 17:28.315
you get me back out there
with Jess

17:28.415 --> 17:30.417
so I can pick up the trail.

17:30.517 --> 17:32.519
I've made my decision.

17:37.357 --> 17:39.025
Fine. You're the boss.

17:39.126 --> 17:40.493
Agent Winchester?

17:41.894 --> 17:45.198
My counterpart at NPS said
another ISB agent,

17:45.298 --> 17:47.667
one right here in D.C.,
was supposed to take this case.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.937
Apparently, you pulled rank
so that you could take lead.

17:51.037 --> 17:53.806
I've been working these murders
for weeks now.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.608
Except you didn't rush
to the other two

17:55.708 --> 17:57.110
crime scenes on a redeye.

17:57.210 --> 17:58.311
This one you did.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.312
What's your point?

17:59.412 --> 18:00.647
Well, we're curious to know

18:00.747 --> 18:02.249
if the fact that NCIS

18:02.349 --> 18:03.483
would be
on this particular murder

18:03.583 --> 18:04.817
played a factor

18:04.917 --> 18:06.386
in your swift call to action.

18:06.486 --> 18:08.421
If you mean Agent Knight?

18:08.521 --> 18:09.789
I came here to catch a killer,

18:09.889 --> 18:11.258
not to catch dinner
with a former flame.

18:11.358 --> 18:15.562
So everything between you two
is just ancient history?

18:15.662 --> 18:18.097
Old as a giant sequoia.

18:25.805 --> 18:28.040
Great. Thank you, Sheriff.

18:28.141 --> 18:33.580
Okay. Knight and Gage found
that evidence-burning fire here.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.748
Nick?

18:35.848 --> 18:39.051
Oh, sorry, man. I just can't
with this guy-- Max Lautner.

18:39.152 --> 18:41.120
Ah. The school parent
that won the lunch with you?

18:41.221 --> 18:44.491
Yeah, he keeps, uh, texting me
trying to set up a date.

18:44.591 --> 18:45.858
Unsolicited advice?

18:45.958 --> 18:47.560
Get it over with,
like, yesterday.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.296
Otherwise, it is a sword
hanging over your head.

18:49.396 --> 18:51.564
Yeah, I'll text him later,
try to set something up

18:51.664 --> 18:53.266
right after
we finish this case.

18:53.366 --> 18:55.735
All right, now you see this,
uh, steep terrain around

18:55.835 --> 18:58.338
the suspect's fire?
Yeah, probably hiked
out of the park

18:58.438 --> 18:59.706
towards, uh, Route 33.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.174
Put out a BOLO,
ten-mile stretch.

19:01.274 --> 19:02.442
Maybe someone saw 'em hitching

19:02.542 --> 19:04.311
or something. Hey.

19:04.411 --> 19:05.778
Have you guys
seen Jess?

19:05.878 --> 19:08.181
Uh, she's with Kasie
down at the lab.

19:08.281 --> 19:10.183
Great.
Hey, uh, Jimmy?

19:10.283 --> 19:11.818
Yeah?
Listen, you, uh...

19:11.918 --> 19:13.453
You know we were just
kind of having fun with you

19:13.553 --> 19:14.954
back at the crime scene, right?

19:15.054 --> 19:16.723
Oh, you're talking
about Agent Winchester?

19:16.823 --> 19:18.491
So, how are you doing
with this whole

19:18.591 --> 19:19.892
situation?

19:19.992 --> 19:21.528
Uh, the only situation
I'm aware of is

19:21.628 --> 19:23.396
that, uh, they were once
in a relationship,

19:23.496 --> 19:25.498
and that relationship
is no more.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.467
Well, that is
a very mature response.

19:27.567 --> 19:28.935
Oh, so you're really not worried

19:29.035 --> 19:30.603
about this, uh,
ghost of boyfriends past?

19:30.703 --> 19:32.372
I don't see why I should be.

19:32.472 --> 19:33.806
You know what?

19:33.906 --> 19:35.942
'Cause you're too nice
of a guy to stalk him,

19:36.042 --> 19:37.310
but I am not.

19:38.110 --> 19:41.281
Aside from having
the coolest name ever,

19:41.381 --> 19:42.649
he's got a life
to match.

19:42.749 --> 19:44.651
I mean, look at all
the cool stuff he does.

19:44.751 --> 19:46.085
Okay, not
that it's a competition,

19:46.185 --> 19:47.654
but you guys know
I have the goods, too, right?

19:47.754 --> 19:50.390
Accomplished doctor,
devoted father,

19:50.490 --> 19:51.858
very dependable friend.

19:51.958 --> 19:54.527
Let's see. I'm a bio-terror
attack survivor.

19:54.627 --> 19:55.595
Okay, Jimmy. I...

19:55.695 --> 19:58.331
Jimmy, trust me, man. We know.

19:58.431 --> 20:02.735
The list of humble brags--
I mean, goes for miles.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.571
But you know what
makes you a great guy?

20:04.671 --> 20:06.138
What?
Lift up your shirt.

20:06.239 --> 20:08.608
Oh, shut up, Nick.
Oh, come on, man.

20:08.708 --> 20:11.711
Show McGee what you're bringing
to the competition.

20:14.447 --> 20:15.848
Damn.
Oh, my God, man.

20:15.948 --> 20:17.116
Jimmy, how long
you've been rocking those guys?

20:17.216 --> 20:18.451
Okay, guys, look.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.186
Jess and I might not have
a label, all right?

20:20.287 --> 20:24.491
But I have zero fear
about this ex-boyfriend of hers

20:24.591 --> 20:25.625
coming back into her life.

20:25.725 --> 20:26.993
It's fine.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.897
Did you see this?
Oh, my God.

20:30.997 --> 20:34.166
Fingerprints don't like heat,
so fire is not their friend.

20:34.267 --> 20:36.536
So I toasted my favorite pair
of field boots

20:36.636 --> 20:38.305
saving all of this stuff
for nothing?

20:38.405 --> 20:41.007
TBD. I was able
to pull enough partials

20:41.107 --> 20:43.242
to piece together
a rough composite,

20:43.343 --> 20:46.012
then fed the computer an
algorithm filling in the gaps,

20:46.112 --> 20:47.814
pulling data
from those in the system

20:47.914 --> 20:49.649
who fit the typical
serial killer profile.

20:49.749 --> 20:53.152
Like how <i>Jurassic Park</i>
plugged the gaps with frog DNA?

20:53.252 --> 20:55.021
Should have said that.
Much easier.

20:55.121 --> 20:58.090
I'm plugging the gaps with
six-foot to six-foot-two

20:58.190 --> 21:01.193
suspects,
most likely Caucasian male,

21:01.294 --> 21:03.430
known history
of knives, yada, yada.

21:03.530 --> 21:05.264
Okay. I will, uh,
update the team.

21:05.365 --> 21:06.633
Uh, no, no, no.

21:06.733 --> 21:08.067
Not so fast.

21:08.167 --> 21:09.602
You failed to mention
the camping companion

21:09.702 --> 21:11.371
from your past
who's roaming the halls

21:11.471 --> 21:13.272
is Paul Bunyan with a badge.

21:13.373 --> 21:14.607
Why didn't it work out?

21:14.707 --> 21:17.109
That is a long story.

21:23.550 --> 21:26.319
One that involves my mother?

21:26.419 --> 21:28.888
Hello, plot twist.

21:28.988 --> 21:31.991
My mom never wanted me
to get into law enforcement.

21:32.091 --> 21:34.060
And when I did,
she stopped talking to me.

21:34.160 --> 21:36.429
But how did Gage play into that?

21:36.529 --> 21:38.465
He was my escape.

21:38.565 --> 21:40.833
Something must have happened.

21:41.668 --> 21:44.537
My mom and I reached
a stalemate.

21:44.637 --> 21:47.440
And once that drama
started fading...

21:49.376 --> 21:51.578
Gage is great
at playing the hero,

21:51.678 --> 21:54.113
and he is there for you
in a crisis.

21:54.213 --> 21:58.885
But once that's over,
he's only there for himself.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.987
His loss is NCIS's gain.

22:01.087 --> 22:03.390
It's weird seeing him here.

22:03.490 --> 22:06.726
It's even weirder having
to work with him again.

22:06.826 --> 22:09.962
That is a delightful analysis
of your past,

22:10.062 --> 22:12.365
but it's really
about your present.

22:12.465 --> 22:15.835
Jimmy.
Whatever happened
with Gage

22:15.935 --> 22:18.605
has you spooked
about working with Jimmy...

22:18.705 --> 22:20.440
if things don't work out.

22:20.540 --> 22:22.909
The real question is,

22:23.009 --> 22:24.877
what do you want now?

22:27.647 --> 22:30.683
Oh. Is that a suspect match?

22:32.051 --> 22:34.253
Saved by the algorithm.

22:34.353 --> 22:38.425
Got a 90% hit
on a convicted felon.

22:38.525 --> 22:40.259
I will take those odds.

22:43.430 --> 22:46.466
Our potential killer
is Greg Patrick Walsh, 42,

22:46.566 --> 22:48.234
a six-foot-one former surgeon

22:48.334 --> 22:50.302
who got his medical start
working for

22:50.403 --> 22:51.738
Médecins Sans Frontières

22:51.838 --> 22:53.606
aiding
Central American refugees.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.842
Knows his knives,
knows his anatomy.

22:55.942 --> 22:57.644
What got him pinched?
He served five years

22:57.744 --> 23:00.480
for medical malpractice
when he operated on and killed

23:00.580 --> 23:02.715
a patient while under
the influence of narcotics.

23:02.815 --> 23:04.651
He was released
on parole a year ago.

23:04.751 --> 23:08.755
Now Dr. Death is on a murder
spree in national parks. So, uh,

23:08.855 --> 23:10.423
what triggered
this second career?

23:10.523 --> 23:12.425
If a predator gets a taste
for blood,

23:12.525 --> 23:14.927
then spends five years
dreaming about it?

23:15.027 --> 23:16.896
He might go on the hunt
once he gets out.

23:16.996 --> 23:18.898
Agent Winchester, turns out
you are not the only one

23:18.998 --> 23:20.299
who can spot a trail.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.134
I just found
Walsh's digital one.

23:22.234 --> 23:23.936
Credit card under his name
was used to check into

23:24.036 --> 23:26.773
a Dulles motel an hour ago,
right by the airport.

23:26.873 --> 23:28.040
He's making a run for it.

23:28.140 --> 23:30.209
Unless we get to him first.
Move out.

23:31.811 --> 23:33.913
Not you, Winchester.

23:34.013 --> 23:35.848
You and I have
superiors to notify.

23:35.948 --> 23:36.949
The others can handle this.

23:37.049 --> 23:38.350
That's my suspect.

23:38.451 --> 23:40.086
My house, my rules.

23:40.186 --> 23:42.288
So why don't you do me a solid
and break them?

23:42.388 --> 23:43.523
Just stand down.

23:44.524 --> 23:45.992
Listen to me, Gage.

23:46.092 --> 23:49.228
Greg Walsh is not worth
sabotaging your career for.

23:50.062 --> 23:53.032
Go bag us that big game, Tripsie.

23:54.501 --> 23:56.936
<i>Well,
that's a mysterious nickname.</i>

23:57.036 --> 23:58.471
Yeah, maybe
I'm overthinking it.

23:58.571 --> 24:00.973
Like, they went on lots of
camping trips together,

24:01.073 --> 24:02.942
and it could be that simple?

24:03.042 --> 24:05.612
Perhaps you're overthinking, period.

24:05.712 --> 24:07.179
It's hard not to.

24:07.279 --> 24:08.948
We're all working
on this case together.

24:09.048 --> 24:10.517
Greg Walsh's profile

24:10.617 --> 24:13.820
as a killer is not the reason
why you invited me

24:13.920 --> 24:14.987
for lunch.

24:15.087 --> 24:16.689
What's the real reason?

24:17.456 --> 24:20.126
I don't like to think of myself
as a jealous person,

24:20.226 --> 24:21.728
but, Doctor, you haven't seen

24:21.828 --> 24:23.395
this Agent Winchester
in the flesh.

24:23.496 --> 24:25.698
I mean, he's like
the walking definition

24:25.798 --> 24:27.600
of-of Darwinian rule.

24:27.700 --> 24:29.536
You're no slouch yourself.

24:29.636 --> 24:32.471
Thank you, but they have
a history together.

24:32.572 --> 24:34.440
Ah.
They trained together.
They camped together.

24:34.541 --> 24:36.142
They were a...

24:36.943 --> 24:38.010
...a they.

24:38.110 --> 24:40.547
And you want that "label"?

24:40.647 --> 24:43.115
Yeah. I do.

24:43.215 --> 24:44.517
Why?

24:44.617 --> 24:46.052
Well, I want her to know
that I'm committed to her.

24:46.152 --> 24:49.121
Uh, or at least to getting
to know her better.

24:49.221 --> 24:51.157
To earning my own nickname
for her.

24:51.257 --> 24:53.893
To creating your own history
with her.

24:53.993 --> 24:56.128
Yes. Yes. Exactly.

24:56.228 --> 25:00.066
And does Jessica seem
equally interested

25:00.166 --> 25:02.034
in knowing about you?

25:03.235 --> 25:04.837
She does.

25:04.937 --> 25:06.105
She's pretty great that way.

25:06.205 --> 25:09.508
So, what does a label have to do

25:09.609 --> 25:13.045
with actions
you're both already taking?

25:15.247 --> 25:18.050
Pardon me, but are you
Dr. James Palmer?

25:19.218 --> 25:21.353
I am. Do we know each other?

25:21.453 --> 25:24.023
Name's Greg Walsh.

25:25.224 --> 25:28.961
And w-what do you want,
Mr. Walsh?

25:35.134 --> 25:37.503
I want you to bring me in
to NCIS.

25:50.016 --> 25:52.719
Let's not make a habit of
lunching with serial killers.

25:52.819 --> 25:54.754
Let's just get this guy
into NCIS custody.

25:54.854 --> 25:56.723
Remember what we discussed.

25:56.823 --> 25:58.625
I came to you
because your reputation

25:58.725 --> 26:00.459
as a physician
proceeds you.
Except unlike you,

26:00.559 --> 26:02.094
I uphold
the Hippocratic Oath.

26:02.194 --> 26:05.297
What kind of a sick game
are you playing, Walsh?

26:05.397 --> 26:07.166
What?
Hey! Winchester!

26:07.266 --> 26:08.768
Back off.

26:08.868 --> 26:11.037
You're lucky I let you
out of your cage.

26:11.738 --> 26:13.239
He's got a fair question, though.

26:13.339 --> 26:14.741
Why are you surrendering?

26:14.841 --> 26:16.743
I'll tell you everything
once we secure me a lawyer.

26:16.843 --> 26:18.945
I don't see what chips you have
to bargain with.

26:19.045 --> 26:21.380
You have no idea
what's really going on,

26:21.480 --> 26:23.249
what you're really
getting involved in.

26:23.349 --> 26:25.017
And you won't, unless...

26:43.535 --> 26:44.570
Oh, my God, Jimmy.

26:44.671 --> 26:46.405
You all right? You hurt?

26:46.505 --> 26:47.940
I'm fine. I'm-I'm fine.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.776
Although between today
and being held hostage here,

26:49.876 --> 26:52.178
I think I might find a new place
to get my tuna melts.

26:55.314 --> 26:58.184
Frankly, I'm more concerned
about Dr. Mallard here.

26:58.284 --> 27:00.386
This is ridiculous.

27:00.486 --> 27:02.488
Doctor, you have
a heart condition.

27:02.588 --> 27:04.590
I have a hunger condition.

27:04.691 --> 27:06.993
Before I die
of malnutrition,

27:07.093 --> 27:09.061
would you get me
a fresh sandwich?

27:09.161 --> 27:11.898
Dr. Palmer and I have
work to do.

27:13.199 --> 27:16.235
Suspects fled
in a black BMW 5 series.

27:16.335 --> 27:18.805
BOLO's out.
There's got to be 100 of those
in the district.

27:18.905 --> 27:21.340
You said, uh, suspects,
so plural?

27:21.440 --> 27:22.775
Saw a shooter and driver.

27:22.875 --> 27:26.679
Why would "anyones," plural,
snipe our serial killer?

27:26.779 --> 27:29.348
I'm guessing they didn't
want Walsh talking to us.

27:29.448 --> 27:31.350
I wonder what
he was going to say.

27:31.450 --> 27:32.952
And who he was so afraid of.

27:33.052 --> 27:34.553
Whatever is going on,

27:34.653 --> 27:36.856
serial killers don't usually
try to cut deals.

27:36.956 --> 27:38.424
Yeah, maybe he was just a pawn.

27:38.524 --> 27:40.259
Taking orders
from somebody else.

27:40.359 --> 27:41.660
Our shooter's a pro.

27:41.761 --> 27:43.930
Center mass, double tap
from a moving car.

27:44.030 --> 27:45.732
That's a very hard shot to make.

27:45.832 --> 27:48.134
So whoever our guys are,
they got skills.

27:48.234 --> 27:51.603
All right, Winchester.
Back to NCIS for you.

27:51.704 --> 27:53.139
Why? Walsh is dead.

27:53.239 --> 27:55.441
We have new suspects now.
You still might be a target.

27:55.541 --> 27:57.143
Yeah, but you brought me out
here to help you arrest Walsh.

27:57.243 --> 27:59.545
Now I am ordering you
to support us back...

27:59.645 --> 28:02.148
No way, you can't...
...at our offices again.

28:05.885 --> 28:08.755
Okay. Back to the ranch.

28:10.723 --> 28:12.458
And the rest of us,

28:12.558 --> 28:13.893
let's work the scene,

28:13.993 --> 28:15.461
see if we can find
a connection between Walsh

28:15.561 --> 28:17.296
and whoever just took him out.

28:24.436 --> 28:25.805
Hey, Doc.

28:26.605 --> 28:28.941
Agent Winchester.
How can I help you?

28:29.041 --> 28:30.777
How's Walsh's autopsy coming?

28:30.877 --> 28:33.312
I just called Agent Parker.
I just completed it.

28:33.412 --> 28:35.547
You are a true master
of your craft, Doc.

28:35.647 --> 28:38.684
Not to toot my own horn,
but, uh, I am.

28:38.785 --> 28:40.019
Toot away.

28:40.119 --> 28:41.320
Yeah?

28:42.021 --> 28:43.589
You ever hear of
a glandular lure?

28:43.689 --> 28:45.557
I'm guessing it has
something to do

28:45.657 --> 28:47.293
with an animal's natural odors?

28:47.393 --> 28:49.762
Bingo. So,
take the Rocky Mountain elk.

28:49.862 --> 28:51.764
A buck uses a musk lure

28:51.864 --> 28:54.133
to attract a doe;
but the doe,

28:54.233 --> 28:56.402
she spreads her own
to attract a buck.

28:56.502 --> 28:58.504
I'm sorry.

28:58.604 --> 29:00.372
Are you talking about
me and Jess?

29:00.472 --> 29:03.810
Mutual scents between you
and her are quite strong.

29:03.910 --> 29:05.511
I missed it before.

29:05.611 --> 29:08.680
Finally picked up on it when
she arrived outside that diner.

29:08.781 --> 29:10.182
What exactly are you two?

29:10.282 --> 29:12.551
Honestly, we're still trying
to figure that out.

29:12.651 --> 29:14.453
Crazy thing is,

29:14.553 --> 29:15.754
a male's musk is so strong,

29:15.855 --> 29:19.391
it often attracts
another male to its turf.

29:19.491 --> 29:20.526
Mm.

29:20.626 --> 29:22.428
You know what happens then?

29:22.528 --> 29:23.930
They compete for the doe.

29:24.030 --> 29:25.597
I came here
to solve these murders,

29:25.697 --> 29:28.434
but I also came
to win back Jess.

29:28.534 --> 29:33.039
Well, you do know that
she's not some prized animal

29:33.139 --> 29:35.441
to be mounted on a wall, right?

29:35.541 --> 29:37.076
I'm no Neanderthal, Doc.

29:37.176 --> 29:40.379
She can choose you, me,
or neither of us, but...

29:40.479 --> 29:41.713
I came to play.

29:41.814 --> 29:42.815
What are we playing?

29:42.915 --> 29:44.783
Jess, hi. You're here.

29:44.884 --> 29:46.385
Agent Knight, hello.

29:46.485 --> 29:49.388
Hmm. Okay.

29:49.488 --> 29:50.689
Uh, so, Parker sent me down here

29:50.789 --> 29:52.191
to see what you got
off the body.

29:52.291 --> 29:53.893
Right.

29:53.993 --> 29:55.962
The deceased had
unusually high cholesterol,

29:56.062 --> 29:58.730
which I would attribute
to a high-fat content diet

29:58.831 --> 30:01.567
as evidenced by
the partially digested

30:01.667 --> 30:03.369
rib eye steak
in his stomach.

30:03.469 --> 30:06.472
Also, he had a high
gallotannin count in his RBCs

30:06.572 --> 30:07.673
which would indicate

30:07.773 --> 30:09.208
that he was
a heavy red wine drinker.

30:09.308 --> 30:11.410
What does this have to do
with how he was killed?

30:11.510 --> 30:13.712
Oh, the cause of death was
two bullets to the chest,

30:13.812 --> 30:15.081
yes, of course.

30:15.181 --> 30:16.782
This is an example of
how my thorough reporting

30:16.883 --> 30:18.184
can uncover a whole host

30:18.284 --> 30:21.287
of outstanding mysteries,
such as...

30:21.387 --> 30:23.923
Walsh's fingertips here.

30:24.023 --> 30:25.958
They're coated
in some sort of odd,

30:26.058 --> 30:27.593
sticky, purple resin.

30:28.995 --> 30:30.662
You recognize something?

30:30.762 --> 30:32.731
Nope. Not really.

30:33.599 --> 30:34.666
I sent a sample to Kasie.

30:34.766 --> 30:36.235
We'll see what
she comes up with.

30:36.335 --> 30:37.636
Well...

30:37.736 --> 30:38.871
not my department.

30:38.971 --> 30:41.440
Thanks for the chat, Doc.

30:49.548 --> 30:51.017
You had a chat?

30:51.117 --> 30:52.784
Guy talk.

30:54.220 --> 30:56.222
I know we haven't
really had a chance

30:56.322 --> 30:58.457
to talk about my past with him.

30:58.557 --> 30:59.892
Yeah, uh...

30:59.992 --> 31:01.827
Do we need to?

31:01.928 --> 31:04.196
I don't know. Do we?

31:04.296 --> 31:06.332
Honestly, not if he's just
in your past.

31:06.432 --> 31:08.234
Oh, he absolutely is.

31:08.334 --> 31:10.436
Great.
We're good, then.

31:10.536 --> 31:13.472
Whatever we are.

31:15.474 --> 31:18.210
Yeah. All good.

31:21.813 --> 31:23.782
<i>Okay.</i>

31:23.882 --> 31:26.285
Director wants an update
on Walsh's executioners.

31:26.385 --> 31:28.520
First one with good news
gets dibs

31:28.620 --> 31:33.892
on these perfectly caramelized
Portuguese <i>pastéis de natas.</i>

31:33.993 --> 31:37.896
Yeah, I got, uh, nada
for those, uh, de natas.

31:37.997 --> 31:39.365
Cameras by the diner
were a bust.

31:39.465 --> 31:40.732
And, uh, yeah,

31:40.832 --> 31:42.568
nothing on the driver
and the shooter.

31:42.668 --> 31:44.136
No treat for you.

31:44.236 --> 31:45.171
McGee,

31:45.271 --> 31:47.073
any luck on their escape route?

31:47.173 --> 31:49.408
Well, I hopscotched traffic cams
for six miles,

31:49.508 --> 31:50.609
but then I lost them.

31:50.709 --> 31:51.978
No treat for you.

31:52.078 --> 31:54.646
Pass the <i>pastéis</i>
and save one for Kasie.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.248
'Cause she just came through.

31:56.348 --> 31:58.750
Yeah, did Kasie ID
the purple mystery goo

31:58.850 --> 31:59.918
on our dead guy's finger?

32:00.019 --> 32:01.720
Uh, no.
She's still working on that.

32:01.820 --> 32:03.755
But she did find this.

32:03.855 --> 32:05.024
So, what am I looking at?

32:05.124 --> 32:06.758
The chemical makeup

32:06.858 --> 32:08.327
of prop oil.

32:08.427 --> 32:10.596
It's a lubricant designed
for light-engine aircraft.

32:10.696 --> 32:12.364
And why am I looking at it?

32:12.464 --> 32:13.532
Kasie pulled it

32:13.632 --> 32:14.800
from the shooter's
shell casings.

32:14.900 --> 32:16.468
So whatever he used
to wipe his prints

32:16.568 --> 32:19.005
before loading them
was covered with prop oil.

32:19.105 --> 32:22.241
So Walsh's killer is also
a small-engine mechanic?

32:22.341 --> 32:24.676
Yeah, or maybe
a small-engine pilot.

32:24.776 --> 32:27.546
Well, there are dozens of, uh,
small airfields in the area.

32:27.646 --> 32:29.815
If our bad guys were looking
to make a getaway,

32:29.915 --> 32:30.983
it's a good place to start.

32:31.083 --> 32:32.418
Treat for you.

32:32.518 --> 32:33.719
Ooh.

32:33.819 --> 32:35.287
All right, where's Winchester?

32:35.387 --> 32:37.089
Let's get him to help
with the search.

32:37.189 --> 32:38.790
Yeah, where is he?

32:38.890 --> 32:41.460
I-I can usually smell
when he's around.

32:43.295 --> 32:44.496
What?

32:44.596 --> 32:46.532
He smells like morning dew
on a spruce tree.

32:46.632 --> 32:48.034
It's nice.

32:49.335 --> 32:51.570
I actually haven't seen him
all morning.

32:51.670 --> 32:52.671
Yeah, but I see

32:52.771 --> 32:54.406
your Spidey-sense tingling.

32:54.506 --> 32:57.343
Well, he was acting a little odd
in autopsy yesterday,

32:57.443 --> 32:59.345
but I was thinking
it was just because of Jimmy.

32:59.445 --> 33:00.812
But now...

33:00.912 --> 33:03.549
What are the chances
he's off chasing his own lead?

33:03.649 --> 33:06.552
Too high.

33:10.056 --> 33:11.623
Yeah?

33:11.723 --> 33:13.159
Gage, where are you?

33:13.259 --> 33:16.195
Not a good time, Jess!

33:16.295 --> 33:17.129
Gage?

33:29.475 --> 33:32.744
Here you go. Just, uh, hold
steady. Get you wrapped up.

33:32.844 --> 33:36.182
Well, that's something
you don't see every day.

33:37.916 --> 33:39.185
You okay?

33:39.285 --> 33:42.221
I'll live, and, uh,
you know, I dig scars.

33:42.321 --> 33:44.623
I hope you dig the one
you just did to your career

33:44.723 --> 33:46.592
with this bonehead move.

33:46.692 --> 33:48.627
Director wants to
permanently dismiss you

33:48.727 --> 33:50.262
from this investigation.

33:50.362 --> 33:51.497
And ISB ain't so happy

33:51.597 --> 33:52.731
with you, either.

33:52.831 --> 33:55.401
Sorry, Tripsie. I-I thought...
Don't.

33:55.501 --> 33:57.503
Don't Tripsie me.

33:57.603 --> 34:00.672
This is exactly why I couldn't
take the next step with you.

34:00.772 --> 34:03.275
Every time I thought that
we could actually be a "we,"

34:03.375 --> 34:06.512
you proved time
and time again...

34:06.612 --> 34:08.947
you could only ever go your way.

34:11.217 --> 34:13.785
You're right.

34:13.885 --> 34:16.688
I messed up. I'm sorry.

34:17.956 --> 34:19.024
All right,
let's hear it, Mr. Hero.

34:19.125 --> 34:21.193
What's this lead
you've been chasing

34:21.293 --> 34:22.494
by yourself?

34:22.594 --> 34:24.663
The purple stains
on Walsh's fingers...

34:24.763 --> 34:26.265
You did recognize them.

34:26.365 --> 34:29.000
They're from the aster
oblongifolius flower.

34:29.101 --> 34:30.669
They're late bloomers
to a specific area

34:30.769 --> 34:32.804
of the park
this time of year.

34:32.904 --> 34:34.773
You were trying to find
Walsh's camp.

34:34.873 --> 34:37.309
Thought you could find something
there that could, uh,

34:37.409 --> 34:38.877
ID the men
who eliminated him.

34:38.977 --> 34:41.780
Long shot, I know,
and, yeah, it was a dead end.

34:41.880 --> 34:44.283
On the way back,
I ran into Smokey over here.

34:44.383 --> 34:45.884
This beast just charged me
out of nowhere.

34:45.984 --> 34:48.287
I thought bears
rarely attack humans.

34:48.387 --> 34:50.055
They don't.

34:50.156 --> 34:52.258
It's like this one's possessed
or something.

34:52.358 --> 34:53.659
Well, smart of you to run

34:53.759 --> 34:55.494
towards the nearest
park ranger station.

34:55.594 --> 34:57.763
They saved my damn life.

34:57.863 --> 34:59.931
Took three trank darts
to bring this guy down.

35:00.766 --> 35:02.468
How many does it normally take?

35:02.568 --> 35:04.636
I haven't seen it take
more than one.

35:04.736 --> 35:06.605
Kind of reminded me of...
An addict?

35:06.705 --> 35:08.274
High on PCP?

35:08.374 --> 35:09.941
The ones where it takes about

35:10.041 --> 35:12.211
a dozen rounds
to stop them?
Yeah.

35:12.311 --> 35:15.747
We need to swab this bear's
saliva and get it to Kasie ASAP.

35:15.847 --> 35:17.716
You want us to collect
bear spit?

35:17.816 --> 35:20.252
I'm not asking you
to French kiss him.

35:20.352 --> 35:21.787
You want to solve this case,

35:21.887 --> 35:23.955
or do you want to stand around
and stare at each other?

35:30.662 --> 35:32.864
Am I right?

35:32.964 --> 35:37.203
Yep. Your bear just tested
positive for cocaine.

35:37.303 --> 35:39.738
Cocaine Bear rides again!

35:40.906 --> 35:42.073
What, you haven't heard the tale

35:42.174 --> 35:44.510
of the legendary
"Pablo Escobear"?

35:44.610 --> 35:45.711
In the '80s,

35:45.811 --> 35:47.246
this drug-smuggler pilot,

35:47.346 --> 35:50.382
he dropped like 70 pounds
of cocaine into some forest.

35:50.482 --> 35:51.850
And then,
his partner was supposed to

35:51.950 --> 35:53.419
hike in and
pick up the blow,

35:53.519 --> 35:55.254
but a bear found it first.

35:55.354 --> 35:56.988
Pablo Escobear. Yeah, cute.

35:57.088 --> 35:58.857
You think we got a sequel
on our hands?

35:58.957 --> 36:00.592
It's a good bet that, uh,

36:00.692 --> 36:02.761
Walsh's shooter knows
how to fly a plane.

36:02.861 --> 36:04.563
Well, that would explain
the airplane oil

36:04.663 --> 36:05.631
on the shell casings.

36:05.731 --> 36:07.132
And an even better bet is,

36:07.233 --> 36:09.401
based on how high
Smokey here is,

36:09.501 --> 36:12.871
he's been dropping cocaine
all over our national parks.

36:12.971 --> 36:15.841
And it was Walsh's job
to hike in and pick it up.

36:15.941 --> 36:18.009
Walsh must've ran into
our petty officer

36:18.109 --> 36:20.045
and didn't want to leave
any witnesses behind.

36:20.145 --> 36:21.913
But why would Walsh
stay in the park

36:22.013 --> 36:24.082
after the murder?
Probably still looking

36:24.182 --> 36:25.417
for the drugs.

36:25.517 --> 36:27.085
He didn't realize
the bear got to them first.

36:27.185 --> 36:29.355
And when he couldn't find them,
he surrendered to us.

36:29.455 --> 36:31.523
He knew that his partners would
try to take him out.

36:31.623 --> 36:32.991
They sound like lovely people.

36:33.091 --> 36:35.427
Any time you want to
arrest them is fine by me.

36:35.527 --> 36:36.828
We got to find them first.

36:36.928 --> 36:38.697
And I know how.

36:40.499 --> 36:41.967
The purple asters.

36:44.370 --> 36:47.138
This is the field where
the asters are still in bloom.

36:48.707 --> 36:52.043
You may have noticed...
They're not far
from an RV camping area.

36:53.279 --> 36:56.415
You thinking our drug smugglers
are using an RV to blend in?

36:56.515 --> 36:59.117
There's got to be hundreds of
RVs that were in the area.

36:59.217 --> 37:00.652
Who knows where
it could be now?

37:00.752 --> 37:01.953
McGEE:
Punch in to where, uh,

37:02.053 --> 37:03.655
Gage had the encounter
with that bear.

37:03.755 --> 37:05.223
All right,
that has to be

37:05.324 --> 37:07.092
the rough drop zone
for the coke.

37:07.192 --> 37:08.827
McGEE:
It's also rough terrain.

37:08.927 --> 37:10.095
If I wanted to get
into that park,

37:10.195 --> 37:12.764
get drugs, get out quickly... ATV.

37:26.478 --> 37:27.846
Federal agents!

37:35.220 --> 37:36.988
Clear.

37:42.060 --> 37:44.530
Well, we found the haul,
but no sign of who's hauling.

37:52.804 --> 37:54.139
Hey there, boys.

37:55.073 --> 37:56.975
Buy you some more Caf-Pows?

38:01.012 --> 38:03.415
More than 30 kilos of
cocaine were recovered.

38:03.515 --> 38:07.118
Save whatever your furry
forest friend consumed.

38:07.218 --> 38:09.388
You get IDs on the smugglers?

38:09.488 --> 38:11.222
Mateo Romero, Quique Morales.

38:11.323 --> 38:14.693
They were former Special Forces
with the Guatemalan Army.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.061
We think Walsh
hooked up with them

38:16.161 --> 38:18.296
during his "good doctor"
days in Central America?

38:18.397 --> 38:20.466
He also got himself hooked
on their product.

38:20.566 --> 38:24.703
He decided to open a
drug-running practice with them.

38:24.803 --> 38:26.538
DEA's on their way.

38:26.638 --> 38:28.340
They're hoping
to use them to catch

38:28.440 --> 38:30.342
the next bigger fish
in the trafficking world.

38:30.442 --> 38:32.778
Just glad to get their poison
out of my parks.

38:32.878 --> 38:34.279
Speaking of your parks,

38:34.380 --> 38:36.382
I put in a call
to your superiors,

38:36.482 --> 38:38.917
and I told them
how cooperative you were

38:39.017 --> 38:40.986
in solving this case.

38:41.086 --> 38:43.555
Without you, we wouldn't
have found the bear.

38:43.655 --> 38:45.056
Thank you.

38:45.156 --> 38:46.458
You know,
I've got some pull

38:46.558 --> 38:47.993
with the NPS bureaucracy.

38:48.093 --> 38:50.562
Might be able to get you
taken off their naughty list.

38:51.363 --> 38:53.064
As long as you promise
to steer clear

38:53.164 --> 38:55.000
of any western snowy plovers.

38:55.100 --> 38:57.369
Maybe we should all steer clear
of each other

38:57.469 --> 38:58.937
in the future?

39:00.872 --> 39:02.608
I hate the city anyway.

39:02.708 --> 39:04.410
Good luck to you.

39:04.510 --> 39:06.044
Thank you.

39:13.151 --> 39:16.021
Cocaine bear.
Yeah, dude, Pablo Escobear.

39:16.121 --> 39:18.223
Got to say, Knight definitely
traded up, huh?

39:18.323 --> 39:19.758
Especially in
the ab department.

39:19.858 --> 39:21.126
Damn, Jimmy.

39:21.226 --> 39:22.327
Right?

39:24.563 --> 39:26.364
It's about that time.

39:26.465 --> 39:29.367
Oh, that's right, your big date
with the school luncheon dad.

39:29.468 --> 39:30.769
Don't call it a date.

39:30.869 --> 39:33.772
And yes, uh, Max Lautner
will be here any moment.

39:33.872 --> 39:36.442
What, you invited him here
for lunch?

39:36.542 --> 39:38.309
He insisted on a tour.

39:38.410 --> 39:40.211
Well, I know you hate it,
but, uh,

39:40.311 --> 39:41.780
think about it
like community outreach.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.048
You're doing a good thing.

39:43.148 --> 39:45.984
I just hope
he doesn't order dessert.

39:46.952 --> 39:48.987
Agent Torres?
Yeah?

39:49.087 --> 39:51.289
Uh, how can I help you?
Hi.

39:51.389 --> 39:52.458
I'm Max.

39:52.558 --> 39:54.092
:
You're...

39:54.192 --> 39:55.894
You're Max Lautner?

39:55.994 --> 39:58.530
Well, Maxine, but I prefer Max.

39:58.630 --> 40:00.666
It is so nice to meet
a live action hero

40:00.766 --> 40:02.400
like you in person.

40:02.501 --> 40:03.935
Oh, yes, well...

40:04.035 --> 40:06.605
Thank you, yes, of course,
and I'm just

40:06.705 --> 40:08.440
so grateful that you're, uh...

40:08.540 --> 40:09.775
you.

40:09.875 --> 40:12.110
Well, as a single mum,

40:12.210 --> 40:13.879
I don't get out very much,

40:13.979 --> 40:16.047
but I, uh,
I cleared my day for this.

40:16.147 --> 40:18.450
Well, that's wonderful news.

40:18.550 --> 40:20.719
Uh, if-if Parker asks,

40:20.819 --> 40:21.887
I'm going to
take a long lunch.

40:21.987 --> 40:23.889
Follow me this way.

40:29.728 --> 40:31.296
I come bearing bento boxes.

40:31.396 --> 40:33.832
Have you eaten lunch yet?
I have not.

40:33.932 --> 40:35.300
That's very kind of you.

40:36.101 --> 40:37.903
I was also asked
to give you this.

40:38.003 --> 40:39.237
It's from Gage.

40:39.337 --> 40:41.172
He's headed to
the airport to go home.

40:41.272 --> 40:42.508
Oh.

40:42.608 --> 40:45.076
I was super tempted to look,
but I restrained.

40:45.176 --> 40:48.146
Yeah, he's just saying goodbye.

40:49.314 --> 40:50.982
I'm pretty sure I...

40:51.082 --> 40:53.418
Yeah, that's-that's written
in campfire ash.

40:54.820 --> 40:57.689
Uh, so... Tripsie?

40:57.789 --> 40:59.124
You gonna give me
a hint on that one,

40:59.224 --> 41:00.258
or you gonna make me guess?

41:00.358 --> 41:02.494
It is short for "Triple Z."

41:02.594 --> 41:04.996
As in Scrabble. Oh.

41:05.096 --> 41:08.233
Because I am queen
of using the ten-point "Z"

41:08.333 --> 41:09.835
on a triple-letter,
triple-word score.

41:09.935 --> 41:12.003
Well, you are gonna
have some competition

41:12.103 --> 41:15.006
because I am
a Scrabble board savant.

41:15.106 --> 41:17.576
Color me eager
to kick your B-U-T-T.

41:21.012 --> 41:24.382
Maybe at our spa weekend away?

41:29.320 --> 41:31.089
Yeah.

41:32.591 --> 41:33.892
Jess.

41:34.993 --> 41:36.528
I was being selfish before,

41:36.628 --> 41:39.297
about needing to put,
like, a label on this.

41:39.397 --> 41:41.232
No, you don't need to apologize
for that.

41:41.332 --> 41:43.869
No, I... I was making it
all about me.

41:43.969 --> 41:47.505
And labels don't matter.

41:48.807 --> 41:51.309
All that matters is you.

41:55.614 --> 41:57.315
Come here, you.
