02:45.822 --> 02:46.690
Huh?

02:57.535 --> 02:58.403
Shh.

03:01.471 --> 03:02.337
Oh wait!

03:02.339 --> 03:03.205
Don't be afraid!

03:04.107 --> 03:04.775
Ouch.

03:06.543 --> 03:09.279
It's just that I love that song.

03:14.552 --> 03:15.419
Huh?

03:54.157 --> 03:54.826
Ah!

04:31.928 --> 04:33.529
Huh?

04:45.308 --> 04:46.176
For later.

04:47.810 --> 04:48.680
Mmm.

04:55.252 --> 04:56.121
Mmm-mmm.

05:22.745 --> 05:23.615
Hmm.

05:26.750 --> 05:28.683
Good night, Apollo.

05:28.685 --> 05:30.452
Sweet dreams, old buddy.

06:09.026 --> 06:09.890
Hey!

06:09.892 --> 06:11.025
Wha?

06:11.027 --> 06:11.895
Sorry!

06:13.430 --> 06:14.899
This is occupied!

06:33.683 --> 06:36.450
What's wrong, Your Serenity?

06:36.452 --> 06:38.286
Your hive is magnificent,

06:38.288 --> 06:39.688
your loving people are
organizing

06:39.690 --> 06:42.524
a grandiose celebration.

06:42.526 --> 06:43.394
So?

06:44.627 --> 06:45.861
You're right, Larry.

06:45.863 --> 06:48.630
And you know how much I love you
all too.

06:48.632 --> 06:52.067
It's just that sometimes
I'd just like to be an

06:52.069 --> 06:53.805
ordinary little bug.

06:55.038 --> 06:56.604
Come on!

06:56.606 --> 06:59.243
You know it well, Your Majesty.

07:01.779 --> 07:04.514
Solitude is a queen's jewellery.

07:08.017 --> 07:09.851
Our majesty.

07:09.853 --> 07:10.722
My queen.

07:11.755 --> 07:13.988
Come now, dearest louse,

07:13.990 --> 07:15.659
we have work to do.

07:32.075 --> 07:33.674
Good morning, Your Majesty!

07:33.676 --> 07:34.676
Hello, everyone.

07:34.678 --> 07:36.645
My queen, my queen,
the buds are opening.

07:36.647 --> 07:38.546
Very well, send a team.

07:38.548 --> 07:39.548
Right away, Your Majesty.

07:39.550 --> 07:40.715
Could you sign these
orders, Your Majesty?

07:40.717 --> 07:41.549
Right, right.

07:41.551 --> 07:43.351
Please remember to tell the
foraging

07:43.353 --> 07:45.620
bees to focus on the
rose bush this morning.

07:45.622 --> 07:46.988
Yes, Your Majesty.

07:46.990 --> 07:49.491
This wall needs to be
finished as soon as possible.

07:49.493 --> 07:50.359
Good work!

07:50.361 --> 07:51.827
Thank you, Your Majesty.

07:51.829 --> 07:54.499
Look, Larry! The fresh honey!

07:55.599 --> 07:56.864
Hello everyone.

07:56.866 --> 07:57.733
Good morning your majesty.

07:57.735 --> 07:58.599
Good morning!

07:58.601 --> 07:59.467
Great job.

07:59.469 --> 08:00.935
Now start extracting the royal
jelly.

08:00.937 --> 08:03.608
Right away, Queen Marguerite!

08:13.384 --> 08:14.916
How's the celebration coming
along?

08:14.918 --> 08:15.920
Fantastic!

08:16.887 --> 08:17.852
There are still a few things to
do,

08:17.854 --> 08:19.453
but we will be ready.

08:19.455 --> 08:20.154
Queen Marguerite!

08:20.156 --> 08:22.560
We need you in the nursery.

08:34.171 --> 08:35.506
Don't worry.

08:38.575 --> 08:39.841
A little drop of royal jelly

08:39.842 --> 08:42.113
will make everything better.

08:45.015 --> 08:48.149
Coochy-coochy,
Coochy-coochy-coo!

08:48.151 --> 08:50.887
Oh!

09:14.777 --> 09:16.477
Your Majesty?

09:16.479 --> 09:18.416
Huh, yes, what is it?

09:19.650 --> 09:23.050
This is the official harvest
report.

09:23.052 --> 09:25.853
Bush number one has been
processed.

09:25.855 --> 09:27.489
Bush number two has been
processed.

09:27.491 --> 09:29.790

09:41.872 --> 09:44.742
bush number 10 has been
processed.

09:52.248 --> 09:53.114
Hi, Lily!

09:53.116 --> 09:53.985
Hi!

09:55.752 --> 09:56.717
They're setting up the boats!

09:56.719 --> 09:57.686
3, 2, 1.

09:57.688 --> 09:58.787
Cheater!

09:58.789 --> 10:01.523
Last one there has to
sleep in the hornet's nest!

10:01.525 --> 10:02.491
I won!

10:02.493 --> 10:03.161
Yeah!

10:04.060 --> 10:05.593
I won, I won!

10:05.595 --> 10:06.827
Flying is cheating!

10:06.829 --> 10:07.696
No, it's not!

10:07.698 --> 10:08.563
Yes, it is!

10:08.565 --> 10:09.231
No, it's not!

10:09.233 --> 10:10.097
Yes, it,

10:10.099 --> 10:11.701
Look, what's that?

10:16.138 --> 10:17.005
Should we wake him up?

10:17.007 --> 10:18.206
No, stop!

10:18.208 --> 10:19.076
Yes!

10:23.146 --> 10:24.011
Hey!

10:24.882 --> 10:26.213
Hello, boys!

10:26.215 --> 10:27.649
Good morning, sir.

10:27.651 --> 10:28.652
Who are you?

10:30.020 --> 10:30.954
Who am I?

10:31.954 --> 10:32.889
A magician!

10:36.059 --> 10:37.195
Maja-cuididai!

10:40.162 --> 10:41.663
Wow!

10:41.665 --> 10:42.930
Get your rose water!

10:42.932 --> 10:43.800
Huh?

10:45.801 --> 10:46.671
And...

10:47.570 --> 10:48.702
ta-da!

10:48.704 --> 10:51.606
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

10:51.608 --> 10:52.307
Stop right there!

10:52.309 --> 10:53.707
No, no

10:53.709 --> 10:55.110
Oh, Kids,

10:55.112 --> 10:56.944
I've told you a million times,
do not

10:56.946 --> 10:58.880
talk to strangers.

10:58.882 --> 11:02.683
Um, Mr Benny, who's
the funny looking man?

11:02.685 --> 11:04.318
Well, hello Mr Benny.

11:04.320 --> 11:06.990
Apollo Cricket at your service.

11:10.227 --> 11:11.726
Right.

11:11.728 --> 11:12.593
How do you do, sir?

11:12.595 --> 11:15.697
Well, sorry, but we're extremely
busy.

11:15.699 --> 11:17.298
Come on kids, off you go.

11:17.300 --> 11:19.067
Go on, we have a lot to prepare
for

11:19.069 --> 11:20.068
the Queen's jubilee!

11:20.070 --> 11:21.870
Can I, can I, can I
help with the garlands?

11:21.872 --> 11:22.603
Yeah, me too!

11:22.605 --> 11:24.172
Please, Mr Benny?

11:24.174 --> 11:26.607
The Queen's jubilee?

11:26.609 --> 11:27.808
Come on, Apollo.

11:27.810 --> 11:28.945
Its show time!

11:35.319 --> 11:37.151
Mmm, that looks good!

11:37.153 --> 11:39.220
No, Bartley, you have to wait.

11:39.222 --> 11:42.026
Preparations are almost
finished.

11:47.998 --> 11:50.664
Oh, that's very pretty, Lily.

11:50.666 --> 11:52.000
Thank you, Betty.

11:52.002 --> 11:53.268
Hey!

11:53.270 --> 11:55.740
Hmph, the Queen's Jubilee!

11:57.741 --> 12:00.007
This is all well and good
for the hillbilly bugs.

12:00.009 --> 12:02.010
Ladies and gentlebugs,

12:03.980 --> 12:05.179
put down your trays and hammers

12:05.181 --> 12:06.047
for a minute,

12:06.049 --> 12:08.283
the show's about to begin.

12:08.285 --> 12:10.217
Come one, come all!

12:10.219 --> 12:11.885
Sweet creatures of the garden!

12:11.887 --> 12:13.355
Funny little bugs of all shapes.

12:13.357 --> 12:15.957
Bush number 77 has been
processed.

12:15.959 --> 12:16.991
Is that a show?

12:16.993 --> 12:17.891
What is going on now?

12:17.893 --> 12:18.927
I must see it!

12:18.929 --> 12:20.395
Come on, Your Majesty!

12:20.397 --> 12:21.795
This is unacceptable!

12:21.797 --> 12:24.064
You're supposed to stay indoors.

12:24.066 --> 12:25.866
Come and discover today's new
talent.

12:25.868 --> 12:28.202
Prepare to be dazed and amazed.

12:28.204 --> 12:29.971
An artist as gifted as he is.

12:29.973 --> 12:31.706
Another traveling performer.

12:31.708 --> 12:32.874
You know him, you love him.

12:32.876 --> 12:35.909
Here he is, Apollo the
Wonder-cricket!

12:35.911 --> 12:37.812
Who's that traveller?

12:37.814 --> 12:39.146
A vagabond cricket.

12:39.148 --> 12:42.049
I never heard of that
guy.

12:42.051 --> 12:44.251
And now that I've captured
the audience's attention,

12:44.253 --> 12:45.922
let the show begin!

13:09.445 --> 13:11.011
Hey, funny man!

13:11.013 --> 13:13.682
Can you please take your
circus at somewhere else?

13:13.684 --> 13:14.549
Look at him!

13:14.551 --> 13:16.083
I've never seen a cricket like
that.

13:16.085 --> 13:16.951
Who's that clown?

13:16.953 --> 13:18.752
I smell trouble.

13:22.092 --> 13:23.627
Trouble, trouble.

13:56.093 --> 13:57.828
Look at this mess.

13:58.762 --> 13:59.760
Please, forgive me!

13:59.762 --> 14:01.029
I don't know what happened.

14:01.031 --> 14:03.063
I'm terribly sorry.

14:03.065 --> 14:05.399
Hey, listen, bozo.

14:05.401 --> 14:06.068
Why don't you go and see how
green the

14:06.070 --> 14:08.068
grass is on the other side?

14:08.070 --> 14:09.404
Look at the mess he made!

14:09.406 --> 14:11.371
Do you want to ruin the Queen's
jubilee?

14:11.373 --> 14:12.240
Right!

14:12.242 --> 14:13.842
Hit the road, cricket!

14:13.844 --> 14:17.077
We've had enough of you already.

14:17.079 --> 14:17.912
Wait!

14:17.914 --> 14:20.448
Don't leave before I pass the
hat!

14:20.450 --> 14:21.318
Please!

14:26.123 --> 14:27.054
Go on, scram!

14:27.056 --> 14:28.021
Arrivederci!

14:28.023 --> 14:29.693
Ciao, you parasite!

14:30.426 --> 14:31.492
Bohemian!

14:31.494 --> 14:32.160
Freegroats!

14:32.162 --> 14:34.328
He didn't sound that bad.

14:34.330 --> 14:35.395
Your Majesty!

14:35.397 --> 14:36.463
Are you joking?

14:36.465 --> 14:40.101
Don't you see the mess he
just made in the garden?

14:40.103 --> 14:42.337
Oh, if I could just go out I
would know!

14:42.339 --> 14:44.304
Do you realize that I'm not
allowed to

14:44.306 --> 14:46.039
help with the preparation,

14:46.041 --> 14:48.042
or go out as I please?

14:48.044 --> 14:49.476
Think of it this way:

14:49.478 --> 14:52.483
to us you are the sun and the
stars.

14:55.451 --> 14:57.452
The heart of this garden.

14:57.454 --> 14:59.353
You're luminescent.

14:59.355 --> 15:01.890
You're too precious.

15:01.892 --> 15:05.393
Ha, so precious that it
must cost me my freedom?

15:05.395 --> 15:07.194
This rule that says the queen
can't

15:07.196 --> 15:10.932
leave the hive except on her
birthday,

15:10.934 --> 15:13.034
isn't it absurd?

15:13.036 --> 15:16.203
I know, Your Highness,
but that's our tradition.

15:16.205 --> 15:17.972
Was it not to shake
up tradition a little

15:17.974 --> 15:20.241
that I decided to appoint
someone like you

15:20.243 --> 15:22.843
and take you under my wing,

15:22.845 --> 15:24.248
my loveable louse?

15:25.849 --> 15:26.914
That's true.

15:26.916 --> 15:30.952
You chose me over another
bee, your cousin Wendy,

15:30.954 --> 15:33.087
who, by the way, was not
particularly

15:33.089 --> 15:34.425
pleased about it.

15:35.858 --> 15:38.329
She's always been very jealous.

15:42.065 --> 15:44.064
You look like you need a hand.

15:44.066 --> 15:47.068
Oh, how nice of you, miss.

15:47.070 --> 15:49.136
Betty, Betty Bee.

15:49.138 --> 15:51.142
Thank you, Miss Betty.

15:53.844 --> 15:56.845
You know, you shouldn't
judge them too harshly.

15:56.847 --> 15:58.913
People here aren't used to
seeing...

15:58.915 --> 16:00.215
Strangers?

16:00.217 --> 16:01.982
Don't worry, I'm used to that.

16:01.984 --> 16:03.418
No, it's not about that.

16:03.420 --> 16:05.553
I meant, everyone's really busy

16:05.555 --> 16:07.922
preparing for Queen Marguerite's
jubilee.

16:07.924 --> 16:11.458
Ah, I wish I could have
played for her jubilee.

16:11.460 --> 16:13.061
This is for you.

16:13.063 --> 16:14.999
How very kind of you.

16:18.068 --> 16:18.967
It's...

16:18.969 --> 16:19.634
It's just that...

16:19.636 --> 16:20.467
Betty!

16:20.469 --> 16:21.436
Betty come on!

16:21.438 --> 16:23.904
We need you to start
hanging the decorations!

16:23.906 --> 16:26.506
I'm sorry, I have to go.

16:26.508 --> 16:28.208
Are you gonna be OK?

16:28.210 --> 16:29.343
No problem, Miss Betty.

16:29.345 --> 16:31.147
Nothing ever bugs me.

16:43.926 --> 16:45.559
huh?

16:45.561 --> 16:46.897
Hello there.

16:47.664 --> 16:48.532
Um, hi!

16:49.632 --> 16:51.098
I'm Wendy Wasp.

16:51.100 --> 16:54.202
You know, I absolutely loved
your show.

16:54.204 --> 16:55.669
Oh, you did, really?

16:55.671 --> 16:58.273
Well that makes one of you!

16:58.275 --> 16:59.439
Of course!

16:59.441 --> 17:01.141
You're very talented.

17:01.143 --> 17:02.543
You know, people in this village
have

17:02.545 --> 17:05.213
no appreciation for artists.

17:05.214 --> 17:07.518
Listen, I'll make you a deal:

17:09.920 --> 17:11.986
I want to prepare a little
surprise

17:11.988 --> 17:14.488
for the Queen's jubilee,

17:14.490 --> 17:17.124
but for that I'd need you to
draw her

17:17.126 --> 17:19.092
away from the hive.

17:19.094 --> 17:20.227
A surprise?

17:20.229 --> 17:21.528
What kind of surprise?

17:21.530 --> 17:24.031
Something special, so she
doesn't feel

17:24.034 --> 17:26.034
so lonely all the time.

17:26.036 --> 17:26.903
Really?

17:27.636 --> 17:29.303
How do you know all this?

17:29.305 --> 17:32.306
Well, I'm her cousin, you see.

17:32.308 --> 17:33.341
Oh, I don't know.

17:33.343 --> 17:35.509
I'm only a stranger here.

17:35.511 --> 17:37.378
Suit yourself, cricket.

17:37.380 --> 17:39.213
That's too bad.

17:39.215 --> 17:42.283
You could have become the
official palace singer.

17:42.285 --> 17:44.284
You could have settled down
here,

17:44.286 --> 17:46.321
made a home in this garden.

17:46.323 --> 17:48.993
But if you're not interested...

17:51.094 --> 17:51.961
A home?

17:54.096 --> 17:55.063
Wait!

17:55.065 --> 17:57.332
Miss Wendy, I'm in!

17:57.334 --> 17:58.666
You've got a deal!

17:58.668 --> 17:59.467
Great.

17:59.469 --> 18:01.335
I'm sure she's going to love
you.

18:01.337 --> 18:02.602
Come with me, I'll tell you
where

18:02.604 --> 18:04.505
to find the queen tonight.

18:04.507 --> 18:06.306
No one knows this,

18:06.308 --> 18:08.376
but sometimes the queen leaves
her

18:08.378 --> 18:09.914
palace in secret.

18:17.487 --> 18:19.089
Work day's over!

18:22.359 --> 18:24.092
Come on, guys!

18:24.094 --> 18:25.296
Everybody home!

18:46.315 --> 18:47.415
I beg of you, Your Highness,

18:47.417 --> 18:49.751
don't go out again tonight!

18:49.753 --> 18:52.219
You know I need it, my dear
Larry.

18:52.221 --> 18:53.086
But what for?

18:53.088 --> 18:54.788
I need to get away.

18:54.790 --> 18:57.124
Even if it's only for an hour!

18:57.126 --> 18:58.059
It's so cold out there!

18:58.061 --> 18:59.593
To be surrounded by nature,

18:59.595 --> 19:01.629
in the sleeping garden.

19:01.631 --> 19:03.096
Scary!

19:03.098 --> 19:04.631
With the stars above me...

19:04.633 --> 19:05.499
Dark!

19:05.501 --> 19:06.367
Beautiful!

19:06.369 --> 19:07.237
Alone!

19:08.571 --> 19:10.303
- You understand?
- You understand?

19:10.305 --> 19:11.174
Oh.

19:16.278 --> 19:17.245
Boo!

19:17.247 --> 19:18.746
Are you afraid of the Pest?

19:18.748 --> 19:19.746
What about the drooling bat

19:19.748 --> 19:21.349
with bloodshot eyes?

19:21.351 --> 19:23.117
It could swallow you whole!

19:23.119 --> 19:24.485
Calm down!

19:24.487 --> 19:27.121
Another bee would just take my
place.

19:27.123 --> 19:30.390
That day will come eventually
anyway.

19:30.392 --> 19:31.258
My word!

19:31.260 --> 19:33.129
She's not even joking!

19:44.207 --> 19:45.075
Phoebe?

19:46.241 --> 19:47.110
Phoebe!

20:05.594 --> 20:06.794
Wendy told me to turn left

20:06.796 --> 20:08.731
after the bridge and...

20:10.200 --> 20:11.067
Hmm.

20:16.506 --> 20:18.105
That's not the queen!

20:18.107 --> 20:18.773
That's the little beggar

20:18.775 --> 20:20.310
from the village.

20:37.259 --> 20:40.261
♪ When my sweetheart seems to
far ♪

20:40.263 --> 20:43.130
♪ I wish upon a star ♪

20:43.132 --> 20:46.469
♪ je vois la vie en rose ♪

20:47.336 --> 20:49.469
Sorry, I didn't want to startle
you

20:49.471 --> 20:50.905
but I love that old song

20:50.907 --> 20:54.374
and you have such a pretty
voice.

20:54.376 --> 20:55.177
Thank you.

20:57.346 --> 20:59.647
I saw you at the village last
night.

20:59.649 --> 21:01.782
You were singing on the bridge.

21:01.784 --> 21:03.420
Yes, that was me.

21:05.154 --> 21:06.286
And you?

21:06.288 --> 21:07.755
What are you doing here?

21:07.757 --> 21:09.689
Well, I'm not sure any more.

21:09.691 --> 21:11.359
I was looking for the queen.

21:11.361 --> 21:12.763
Have you seen her?

21:13.696 --> 21:14.565
No, why?

21:17.167 --> 21:17.834
Too bad.

21:19.469 --> 21:21.302
That's all right, I just
wanted

21:21.304 --> 21:22.870
to meet her.

21:22.872 --> 21:24.338
The queen?

21:24.340 --> 21:26.573
Nobody gets to meet the queen.

21:26.575 --> 21:29.379
She's way too busy and
essential.

21:31.314 --> 21:33.714
Why do you want to meet her
anyway?

21:33.716 --> 21:35.882
Oh, you really want to know?

21:35.884 --> 21:37.621
Wait, I'll show you!

21:39.689 --> 21:40.655
Apollo Cricket!

21:40.657 --> 21:44.492
The greatest music hall
star there ever was!

21:44.494 --> 21:46.459
Apollo toured the palaces of
Europe

21:46.461 --> 21:49.463
and the biggest concert
halls in the world!

21:49.465 --> 21:51.668
I was the king in my field.

21:52.802 --> 21:54.502
Well.

21:54.504 --> 21:57.271
I played the Paris Opera Hive!

21:57.273 --> 21:59.340
Bugland, Carnabee Hall.

21:59.342 --> 22:00.841
The Beetlepolitan.

22:00.843 --> 22:02.476
The Bugno Café.

22:02.478 --> 22:04.748
The Vegetable Square Garden!

22:05.949 --> 22:06.816
Ah yes.

22:19.394 --> 22:21.629
Boo, get off the lily
pad!

22:21.631 --> 22:22.900
Get out of here!

22:24.534 --> 22:27.634
And then, one day, I lost
everything.

22:27.636 --> 22:29.536
So here I am.

22:29.538 --> 22:31.471
A travelling performer

22:31.473 --> 22:34.610
without a troupe, without an
audience.

22:35.545 --> 22:37.978
But now, I have a hope in my
heart.

22:37.980 --> 22:38.979
The queen?

22:38.981 --> 22:41.782
I would be so happy
to play for her jubilee.

22:41.784 --> 22:45.322
But I don't think that's going
to happen.

22:46.521 --> 22:48.022
Just my luck.

22:48.024 --> 22:50.561
If only I could have met her.

22:51.628 --> 22:54.861
But I know, she's so important.

22:54.863 --> 22:56.933
So busy, she's the queen!

23:01.437 --> 23:02.570
Yes, of course,

23:02.572 --> 23:05.805
she has to care about everybody
here.

23:05.807 --> 23:08.478
She has so much responsibility.

23:11.014 --> 23:12.513
Exactly.

23:12.515 --> 23:13.680
I understand why she has no time

23:13.682 --> 23:15.549
for a loser like me.

23:17.886 --> 23:19.986
You said you lost everything.

23:19.988 --> 23:21.589
What happened?

23:21.591 --> 23:24.391
Oh, that is a really long
story.

23:24.393 --> 23:26.494
Anyway, enough about me.

23:26.496 --> 23:29.333
You didn't even tell me your
name.

23:30.400 --> 23:31.765
I'm...

23:31.767 --> 23:32.969
I'm Marguerite.

23:34.569 --> 23:37.804
So, Marguerite, what brings
you here?

23:37.806 --> 23:39.942
Oh, that's a long story.

23:57.893 --> 23:59.496
Goodnight, guys!

24:09.439 --> 24:10.306
Huh?

24:32.027 --> 24:33.794
We are the Pests!

24:33.796 --> 24:36.130
It's bad we do best!

24:36.132 --> 24:37.633
We are the Pests!

24:38.534 --> 24:40.070
It's bad we do best!

24:41.603 --> 24:42.469
We sleep all day.

24:42.471 --> 24:43.603
At night we play.

24:43.605 --> 24:44.471
We'll steal your stuff.

24:44.473 --> 24:45.538
And fly away.

24:45.540 --> 24:46.876
You'd better hide

24:50.078 --> 24:52.612
Because tonight we ride.

24:52.614 --> 24:55.149
Boo!

24:55.151 --> 24:58.755
We are the Pests, the best of
the pests!

25:06.395 --> 25:08.528
All night we plunder and
fight,

25:08.530 --> 25:10.464
and fill your night with fear
and fright!

25:10.466 --> 25:11.832
We are the Pests,

25:11.834 --> 25:13.703
the best of the pests!

25:23.478 --> 25:25.348
Blitz on the garden.

25:34.690 --> 25:35.555
Hey, boss,

25:35.557 --> 25:38.159
I feel ready for another raid
tonight.

25:38.161 --> 25:39.959
Chill the bug out, Daddy Boom.

25:39.961 --> 25:41.728
Hello, Sphinx.

25:41.730 --> 25:42.598
Wendy!

25:43.732 --> 25:46.602
To what do we owe the
displeasure?

25:49.071 --> 25:50.438
Watch your mouth, grandpa!

25:50.440 --> 25:52.038
Easy, General Helium.

25:52.040 --> 25:55.476
Tell me, Sphinx, my old friend,

25:55.478 --> 25:57.044
I see you're still looting
around

25:57.046 --> 25:59.447
like a bunch of pirates.

25:59.449 --> 26:02.853
It must be really sad for you
and your uh,

26:03.920 --> 26:06.620
merry bugs.

26:06.622 --> 26:07.888
So what?

26:07.890 --> 26:10.157
You've been dangling a grand
scheme

26:10.159 --> 26:11.958
in front of us for months,

26:11.960 --> 26:13.194
but it still hasn't put any
honey

26:13.196 --> 26:14.598
in our pockets.

26:15.498 --> 26:17.497
Funny you should say that.

26:17.499 --> 26:19.999
An impromptu arrival has just
given us

26:20.001 --> 26:23.003
the last piece of the puzzle.

26:23.005 --> 26:24.938
If our agreement still stands,

26:24.940 --> 26:26.207
we're moving tonight.

26:26.209 --> 26:28.609
We'll hold our end of the
bargain

26:28.611 --> 26:30.777
and in exchange, you'll deliver
us a

26:30.779 --> 26:32.449
full load of honey.

26:33.482 --> 26:35.017
Let's shake on it.

26:35.985 --> 26:38.886
Yeah, let's not and say we
did.

26:38.888 --> 26:40.720
Out of my way, squirt!

26:40.722 --> 26:42.121
Are you looking for a fight?

26:45.928 --> 26:46.796
Helium!

26:50.600 --> 26:52.632
The Vampire's on the prowl.

26:52.634 --> 26:54.267
Mickey, Daddy Boom, Incognito!

26:54.269 --> 26:55.204
Let's move.

27:08.884 --> 27:09.816
Quick!

27:09.818 --> 27:10.820
Make a wish!

27:15.257 --> 27:18.057
You see those stars on the left?

27:18.059 --> 27:21.063
That's the constellation of the
bee.

27:24.232 --> 27:25.064
See?

27:25.066 --> 27:29.303
Yes, I can see it
now.

27:29.305 --> 27:31.104
And look over there!

27:31.106 --> 27:32.672
This is the constellation

27:32.674 --> 27:34.076
of the troubadour.

27:36.546 --> 27:37.678
Oh yeah!

27:37.680 --> 27:39.483
Good eye, Marguerite!

27:40.882 --> 27:43.717
You know, next to it,
there's the constellation

27:43.719 --> 27:45.522
of the little beggar.

27:49.758 --> 27:52.161
Two wanderers among the stars.

27:57.667 --> 27:58.735
Actually...

27:59.602 --> 28:01.834
the one right next to the
troubadour

28:01.836 --> 28:05.975
is the constellation of
Marguerite, the Queen Bee.

28:09.612 --> 28:10.881
The Queen Bee?

28:13.114 --> 28:14.715
Queen Marguerite!

28:14.717 --> 28:15.584
Woah!

28:19.822 --> 28:21.220
Your Majesty, Your Grace!

28:21.222 --> 28:22.089
If I had only known...

28:22.091 --> 28:23.056
I messed up again.

28:23.058 --> 28:24.592
Once more, I am so sorry, I...

28:24.594 --> 28:26.060
Sorry for what?

28:26.062 --> 28:28.227
For having been sweet and kind?

28:28.229 --> 28:29.630
Don't worry.

28:29.632 --> 28:31.130
You're not from here, but you're
a

28:31.132 --> 28:33.002
credit to our village.

28:35.938 --> 28:37.271
Just one thing:

28:37.273 --> 28:39.305
no one can know you saw me here.

28:39.307 --> 28:41.641
That will be our secret.

28:41.643 --> 28:43.046
Do you understand?

28:44.880 --> 28:45.979
Of course.

28:45.981 --> 28:48.651
You have my word, Your Majesty.

28:49.818 --> 28:53.120
Would you sing that
song we like, for me?

28:53.122 --> 28:55.225
Oh, I don't know... I...

28:59.894 --> 29:01.661
Don't sing for the queen,

29:01.663 --> 29:03.866
sing for the little beggar.

I wish I could just enjoy it.

31:16.398 --> 31:19.099
Queen Marguerite, I
think we should head back.

31:19.101 --> 31:20.234
Come on, Apollo,

31:20.236 --> 31:25.139
I've never seen my garden
in a more beautiful light.

31:25.141 --> 31:27.009
And look at that moon.

31:29.210 --> 31:31.146
It's a real honey moon.

31:32.381 --> 31:35.149
Those golden reflections...

31:35.151 --> 31:38.017
that light is magic, isn't it?

31:38.019 --> 31:39.488
Oh yes, the moon.

31:41.457 --> 31:44.728
Let me pluck it from the sky for
you.

31:46.461 --> 31:48.397
A teardrop from heaven.

31:49.465 --> 31:51.031
And now...

31:51.033 --> 31:51.901
magic!

31:52.567 --> 31:54.103
Magic acridiadai!

32:06.981 --> 32:09.216
What a great show, cricket!

32:09.218 --> 32:10.085
So sweet!

32:14.390 --> 32:15.288
The Pests.

32:15.290 --> 32:17.090
What are you doing here?

32:17.092 --> 32:19.025
Thanks for delivering the
package.

32:19.027 --> 32:21.495
We'll take it from here,
cricket.

32:21.497 --> 32:22.361
Wait, what?

32:22.363 --> 32:24.096
- Apollo?
- Me?

32:24.098 --> 32:25.165
Was this a trap?

32:25.167 --> 32:26.432
Of course not, Marguerite!

32:26.434 --> 32:27.601
I've never met these people.

32:27.603 --> 32:28.901
I don't know...

32:33.542 --> 32:34.874
Holy antennae!

32:34.876 --> 32:35.878
The vampire!

32:40.850 --> 32:42.315
Marguerite!

32:42.317 --> 32:43.217
Help!

32:43.219 --> 32:44.086
Help me!

32:45.187 --> 32:46.256
Marguerite!

32:48.591 --> 32:50.860
Over here, you bad bat!

32:56.431 --> 32:57.864
I didn't mean that!

32:57.866 --> 32:59.268
You misunderstood!

33:03.205 --> 33:05.072
That is one crazy cricket!

33:05.074 --> 33:05.941
Ouch!

33:32.601 --> 33:33.900
I'm not going, I'm going.

33:33.902 --> 33:34.901
I'm not going, I'm going.

33:34.903 --> 33:37.403
I'm not going, I'm not
going, I'm not going.

33:37.405 --> 33:39.339
I don't believe it.

33:39.341 --> 33:40.610
Okay, I'm going.

33:46.981 --> 33:49.549
"The queen has gone to Lovers'
Corner

33:49.551 --> 33:52.155
"and I think she's in danger."

33:53.588 --> 33:54.454
The Queen!

33:54.456 --> 33:55.589
The Queen is in danger!

33:55.591 --> 33:56.459
The queen!

33:58.059 --> 33:58.926
You, follow me!

33:58.928 --> 34:00.430
To the watering can!

34:02.264 --> 34:03.166
I mean now!

34:05.167 --> 34:06.035
Apollo?

34:07.201 --> 34:08.071
Apollo?

34:11.339 --> 34:12.608
There you are.

34:13.942 --> 34:16.310
Boys, this lady here is worth
her

34:16.312 --> 34:17.580
weight in honey.

34:20.149 --> 34:21.415
No, help, please.

34:21.417 --> 34:22.581
Help me!

34:22.583 --> 34:23.453
Help!

34:25.154 --> 34:26.022
Help!

34:31.460 --> 34:32.527
Marguerite?

34:35.630 --> 34:36.665
Your Majesty?

34:43.705 --> 34:44.638
Your Majesty,

34:44.639 --> 34:46.205
are you?

34:46.206 --> 34:47.373
Oh no!

34:47.375 --> 34:48.310
Marguerite!

34:54.116 --> 34:55.318
Oh, Marguerite.

35:10.165 --> 35:11.230
Mm?

35:11.232 --> 35:12.100
Hmmm.

35:20.075 --> 35:20.741
Wendy!

35:20.743 --> 35:21.542
It's horrible, horrible!

35:21.544 --> 35:23.342
Queen Marguerite has
disappeared!

35:23.344 --> 35:24.377
Disappeared?

35:24.379 --> 35:25.779
Really?

35:25.781 --> 35:26.480
It was a nightmare.

35:26.482 --> 35:28.315
There was a gang of scary pests

35:28.317 --> 35:31.283
and worst of all a huge vampire.

35:31.285 --> 35:33.487
What on earth are you talking
about?

35:33.489 --> 35:34.420
There he is!

35:34.422 --> 35:35.288
That's him!

35:35.290 --> 35:36.255
That is him!

35:36.257 --> 35:37.457
The stray roach!

35:37.459 --> 35:38.324
We've got him!

35:38.326 --> 35:39.194
What?

35:41.263 --> 35:43.562
Where is our queen, stranger?

35:43.564 --> 35:44.433
Answer me!

35:45.567 --> 35:46.632
This is all a
misunderstanding.

35:46.634 --> 35:49.469
Wendy, please, you must tell
him!

35:49.471 --> 35:50.636
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

35:50.638 --> 35:52.605
What have you done?

35:52.607 --> 35:53.473
Me?

35:53.475 --> 35:54.507
I haven't done anything!

35:54.509 --> 35:55.578
I'm innocent!

35:59.714 --> 36:01.714
Sphinx Moth, why?

36:01.716 --> 36:03.116
How could you?

36:03.118 --> 36:05.419
It's very simple, Your
Majesty.

36:05.421 --> 36:07.487
Thanks to you we'll soon get
more money

36:07.489 --> 36:09.255
than we've ever had before.

36:09.257 --> 36:10.727
A mountain of gold!

36:13.161 --> 36:15.497
Got to feed my men, you know.

36:42.491 --> 36:45.495
You plan on holding me for
ransom?

36:46.495 --> 36:49.596
Let's say I accepted
a business proposition.

36:49.598 --> 36:52.364
I knew you were a
thief, but a kidnapper?

36:52.366 --> 36:54.100
You know you're just as bad as
the bats.

36:54.102 --> 36:55.734
That's enough.

36:55.736 --> 36:57.337
Look at my wing.

36:57.339 --> 36:58.804
The bat did that.

36:58.806 --> 37:01.274
That monster was never one of
us.

37:01.276 --> 37:03.844
Every time we venture outside to
feed,

37:03.846 --> 37:06.545
we risk life, limb and wing.

37:06.547 --> 37:08.315
We never had a choice.

37:08.317 --> 37:10.650
We do what we can to survive.

37:10.652 --> 37:13.723
But we could have found a
solution.

37:14.823 --> 37:16.823
You sweet little day bugs have
always

37:16.825 --> 37:19.725
shunned us nocturnal creatures.

37:19.727 --> 37:23.129
Because you're always
robbing and bullying us.

37:23.131 --> 37:25.600
But we can still change things.

37:28.736 --> 37:30.270
Can we jam her now?

37:30.272 --> 37:31.304
Jam, jam!

37:31.306 --> 37:32.438
No, Nicky.

37:32.440 --> 37:34.708
Incognito, lock her in the
dungeon.

37:34.710 --> 37:35.578
Yes, Boss!

37:56.497 --> 37:58.598
Hey, where are you going?

37:58.600 --> 37:59.431
I'm a forager.

37:59.433 --> 38:00.667
I'm going to forage.

38:00.669 --> 38:01.935
But which flower?

38:01.937 --> 38:04.571
Where are we supposed to go this
morning?

38:04.573 --> 38:05.438
That's a good question.

38:05.440 --> 38:07.841
The queen didn't tell us
anything today.

38:07.843 --> 38:10.580
And where is the queen anyway?

38:14.683 --> 38:17.616
Has anybody seen the queen?

38:17.618 --> 38:19.286
Hey, Bartley!

38:19.288 --> 38:21.288
You know what happened?

38:21.290 --> 38:23.522
What's going on?

38:23.524 --> 38:25.424
I heard the vampire scream in
the night.

38:25.426 --> 38:26.725
What's going on?

38:26.727 --> 38:28.361
The queen has gone missing.

38:28.363 --> 38:30.297
We're looking all over for her.

38:30.299 --> 38:31.964
We've got him!

38:31.966 --> 38:34.201
Don't look any further, my
friends.

38:34.203 --> 38:35.801
We have the guilty party.

38:35.803 --> 38:39.205
He masterminded the whole thing.

38:39.207 --> 38:40.343
Apollo, You?

38:41.343 --> 38:42.641
I've done nothing wrong!

38:42.643 --> 38:43.509
Please believe me!

38:43.511 --> 38:44.580
I'm innocent!

38:50.585 --> 38:52.585
Where's our queen, cricket?

38:52.587 --> 38:53.853
Is she even alive?

38:53.855 --> 38:54.955
For all we know the queen

38:54.957 --> 38:57.424
has been devoured by the
vampire.

38:57.426 --> 38:59.859
Or handed over to the Pests!

38:59.861 --> 39:01.261
Down with the stranger!

39:01.263 --> 39:03.330
Down with the
stranger!

39:03.332 --> 39:04.964
Down with the stranger!

39:04.966 --> 39:07.734
Down with the stranger!

39:07.736 --> 39:09.368
Friends, calm down!

39:09.370 --> 39:12.339
He's innocent until proven
guilty!

39:12.341 --> 39:14.473
I saw him by the watering can.

39:14.475 --> 39:15.674
There were footprints

39:15.676 --> 39:18.277
and in his hand he had...

39:18.279 --> 39:18.948
This!

39:19.814 --> 39:20.815
Huh?

39:21.882 --> 39:23.949
Oh, I mean this!

39:26.989 --> 39:27.821
Boo!

39:27.823 --> 39:29.288
Go back to where you came
from!

39:29.290 --> 39:30.493
Shame! Shame!

39:31.692 --> 39:33.726
Get out of here, foreigner!

39:33.728 --> 39:35.027
Down with the stranger!

39:35.029 --> 39:37.364
Down with the stranger!

39:37.366 --> 39:39.399
Down with the stranger!

39:39.401 --> 39:40.299
Cricket bad!

39:40.301 --> 39:42.268
Bad old cricket!

39:42.270 --> 39:42.935
Get out of here!

39:45.339 --> 39:47.906
General Helium, now is the
time.

39:47.908 --> 39:49.377
Yes, my Queen.

39:50.611 --> 39:52.379
Friends, calm down.

39:52.381 --> 39:54.980
Luckily, Wendy captured the
stranger,

39:54.982 --> 39:57.917
otherwise he would have
left the garden already.

39:57.919 --> 39:58.618
What?

39:58.620 --> 40:00.719
No, no, no, no, you're mistaken!

40:00.721 --> 40:01.587
Wendy, you're the one who...

40:01.589 --> 40:03.022
Wendy? What?

40:03.024 --> 40:04.790
You took advantage of our
trusting

40:04.792 --> 40:06.893
and welcoming nature.

40:06.895 --> 40:09.728
The guilty cricket shall be
punished.

40:09.730 --> 40:13.866
He will be given as an
offering to the vampire.

40:13.868 --> 40:15.671
The, the, the what?

40:18.873 --> 40:20.373
Let me out!

40:20.375 --> 40:21.040
I'm innocent!

40:21.042 --> 40:22.310
I was framed!

40:23.645 --> 40:25.612
If you're really a magician,

40:25.614 --> 40:27.846
do the great escape trick!

40:28.884 --> 40:30.683
You're so funny.

40:30.685 --> 40:32.384
Wait, wait, wait...

40:32.386 --> 40:33.522
you hear that?

40:55.777 --> 40:59.612
Dear friends, everything
leads us to believe that

40:59.614 --> 41:03.583
our beloved Marguerite
might never return home.

41:03.585 --> 41:04.583
No!

41:04.585 --> 41:05.851
And as you know,

41:05.853 --> 41:09.388
the hive cannot remain without a
leader.

41:09.390 --> 41:10.824
I'll be your new queen

41:10.826 --> 41:12.591
until further notice.

41:15.497 --> 41:18.364
I'm declaring a curfew as of
tonight.

41:18.366 --> 41:20.900
The honey bees must
pledge allegiance to us

41:20.902 --> 41:22.868
and keep the hive running.

41:22.870 --> 41:25.739
Those who refuse will
be immediately banished.

41:25.741 --> 41:26.507
What, the queen?

41:26.509 --> 41:29.312
- Shh.
- Imprisoned or squashed.

41:31.046 --> 41:34.317
And finally, the jubilee garden
party

41:35.015 --> 41:38.585
will be replaced by a grand wasp
ball

41:38.587 --> 41:40.790
to celebrate my coronation.

41:45.694 --> 41:47.096
You may leave now.

41:48.096 --> 41:51.431
Hey, the new
queen told you to leave.

41:51.433 --> 41:52.968
Go on, back to work.

41:54.136 --> 41:56.069
I don't think I'm gonna like
this.

41:56.071 --> 41:57.670
Yes, well I don't think we
have much

41:57.672 --> 41:58.473
of a choice.

42:00.408 --> 42:03.411
Well then, let's go save the
hive.

42:06.080 --> 42:07.615
Louse! Come here!

42:38.580 --> 42:42.518
If my memory serves me
right, it's around here.

42:49.457 --> 42:52.759
The most precious treasure
in the whole garden

42:52.761 --> 42:57.767
and whoever controls the
royal jelly controls the hive.

43:08.877 --> 43:10.576
Who's there?

43:10.578 --> 43:13.047
We're here to make a deposit.

43:14.783 --> 43:16.516
Honey, so much honey!

43:16.518 --> 43:18.250
I hope it's the amount we agreed
on.

43:18.252 --> 43:19.185
What do you mean?

43:19.187 --> 43:20.652
You don't trust us?

43:20.654 --> 43:22.688
Calm down, Verminator.

43:22.690 --> 43:24.824
Mickey's young and restless.

43:24.826 --> 43:28.261
He still has to learn that
he can trust a good traitor.

43:28.263 --> 43:29.696
Now, what did you call me?

43:29.698 --> 43:31.029
Enough!

43:31.031 --> 43:33.165
You have your reward, Sphinx,

43:33.167 --> 43:34.836
now take me to her.

43:46.047 --> 43:46.745
Wendy!

43:46.747 --> 43:49.281
Oh, I'm so happy you found me!

43:49.283 --> 43:52.652
Hmmm, what a delightful place.

43:52.654 --> 43:54.056
A bit damp, maybe,

43:54.922 --> 43:57.824
but isn't that exactly
what you wished for?

43:57.826 --> 44:00.993
To be just another ordinary
little bug?

44:00.995 --> 44:03.228
You, you're with them?

44:03.230 --> 44:04.297
Why?

44:04.299 --> 44:05.964
We've known each other forever.

44:05.966 --> 44:08.567
Yes, we did grow up together,

44:08.569 --> 44:09.969
but then you cast me away

44:09.971 --> 44:11.538
because I was just a wasp.

44:11.540 --> 44:12.538
Wendy...

44:12.540 --> 44:13.440
Admit it!

44:13.442 --> 44:15.542
I never wanted you to feel
rejected,

44:15.544 --> 44:17.143
but you do know that only a bee

44:17.145 --> 44:18.944
can run a beehive?

44:18.946 --> 44:21.714
Well, we'll see about that.

44:21.716 --> 44:23.116
I will soon be crowned

44:23.118 --> 44:25.851
and I shall reign over the hive.

44:25.853 --> 44:27.953
Your little garden will become a
royal

44:27.955 --> 44:29.788
jelly making machine

44:29.790 --> 44:33.560
and I'll be the most powerful
queen ever!

44:33.562 --> 44:35.728
No, you don't understand!

44:35.730 --> 44:38.598
Being queen means you
have to protect the garden

44:38.600 --> 44:41.234
and every single one of its
inhabitants.

44:41.236 --> 44:43.136
If you unsettle it, you'll run
our

44:43.138 --> 44:45.103
garden to the ground.

44:45.105 --> 44:46.873
The whole village knows that.

44:46.875 --> 44:48.274
They'll never obey you.

44:48.276 --> 44:50.042
That's right.

44:50.044 --> 44:51.877
You haven't heard the news.

44:51.879 --> 44:53.346
You've been assassinated, dear.

44:53.348 --> 44:54.813
What?

44:54.815 --> 44:56.815
But don't you worry about a
thing.

44:56.817 --> 44:58.784
That vagabond cricket will be
punished

44:58.786 --> 45:01.254
for that horrible crime.

45:01.256 --> 45:02.123
Apollo?

45:04.091 --> 45:04.958
You'd better forget about him.

45:04.960 --> 45:05.924
Oh no!

45:05.926 --> 45:06.794
Forever.

45:08.228 --> 45:09.098
Wendy!

45:16.370 --> 45:18.804
Oh and Sphinx, tomorrow you
will bring

45:18.806 --> 45:20.073
me the queen's head.

45:20.075 --> 45:21.373
What?

45:21.375 --> 45:23.909
That was never part of our deal.

45:23.911 --> 45:26.179
Winter is coming, Sphinx.

45:26.181 --> 45:27.913
You wouldn't want me to deprive
you

45:27.915 --> 45:29.919
of our honey, would you?

45:33.321 --> 45:34.754
Then we agree.

45:34.756 --> 45:36.825
See you tomorrow, Sphinx.

45:39.227 --> 45:42.830
This deal is getting worse all
the time.

45:49.770 --> 45:50.969
Go on!

45:50.971 --> 45:53.174
Work harder, you lazy bees!

46:07.821 --> 46:09.290
This is the life!

46:10.392 --> 46:13.895
We should have done this a long
time ago.

46:18.933 --> 46:20.002
Back to work!

46:34.181 --> 46:35.651
Faster!

47:35.410 --> 47:36.678
Marguerite.

47:51.893 --> 47:52.761
Apollo.

47:57.866 --> 48:02.467
♪ When my sweetheart seems to
far ♪

48:02.469 --> 48:05.437
♪ I wish upon a star ♪

48:05.439 --> 48:08.976
♪ Je vois la vie en rose ♪

48:20.888 --> 48:23.091
Well Apollo, is that all?

48:27.261 --> 48:28.196
Yes, it is.

48:30.230 --> 48:32.899
Did you really think
your life could change,

48:32.901 --> 48:34.303
just because of...

48:36.236 --> 48:37.105
love?

48:42.477 --> 48:47.078
♪ Then the beauty of the song ♪

48:47.080 --> 48:50.348

49:11.071 --> 49:11.939
Love!

49:27.589 --> 49:31.257
You know what I like best
about that blade, Boss?

49:31.259 --> 49:33.359
It's that we never use it,

49:33.361 --> 49:36.094
and I hope we never will.

49:36.096 --> 49:37.299
Give me that!

49:52.379 --> 49:56.082
She told you to kill me,
didn't she?

49:56.084 --> 49:57.415
I understand.

49:57.417 --> 50:00.920
You want to protect your own,
Sphinx Moth,

50:00.922 --> 50:03.489
but if you follow Wendy and her
madness,

50:03.491 --> 50:05.227
the garden will die.

50:07.027 --> 50:08.426
You and your men will no longer

50:08.428 --> 50:10.629
be able to live there.

50:10.631 --> 50:13.165
We've got no other choice.

50:13.167 --> 50:16.038
We always have a choice,
Sphinx.

50:26.948 --> 50:29.147
Not enough portraits of me
around here.

50:29.149 --> 50:31.317
That needs to change, pronto!

50:31.319 --> 50:33.419
Wendy, we had a problem.

50:33.421 --> 50:35.620
The tank's not filling up fast
enough

50:35.622 --> 50:38.024
and the honey quality is
decreasing.

50:38.026 --> 50:38.891
Don't worry,

50:38.893 --> 50:41.527
I know an excellent motivational
tool.

50:41.529 --> 50:44.330
Tell the bees they must
double their efforts.

50:44.332 --> 50:46.966
If they don't, all their
precious babies

50:46.968 --> 50:49.502
will be abandoned at the
far end of the garden

50:49.504 --> 50:51.636
by this time tomorrow!

50:51.638 --> 50:53.638
And if some of them keep
resisting,

50:53.640 --> 50:55.473
they will face the same
punishment

50:55.475 --> 50:58.076
as that annoying cricket.

51:09.357 --> 51:10.225
What?

51:11.558 --> 51:13.192
So the queen is alive?

51:13.194 --> 51:17.062
And you think Wendy is behind
all this?

51:17.064 --> 51:17.998
Yes.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.333
She's made a secret pact with
the Pests.

51:20.335 --> 51:22.435
Unbelievable!

51:22.437 --> 51:24.069
But far from surprising.

51:24.071 --> 51:25.971
This is a disaster.

51:25.973 --> 51:27.672
We must save our queen.

51:27.674 --> 51:29.208
That's our only hope.

51:29.210 --> 51:30.542
If we bring Marguerite back,

51:30.544 --> 51:33.011
the whole village will know
Wendy's lying.

51:33.013 --> 51:35.748
And the queen will reclaim her
throne.

51:35.750 --> 51:38.216
Great but, how do we do it?

51:38.218 --> 51:40.018
Do you think kidnappers
release their prisoners

51:40.020 --> 51:41.587
just because you ask them to,

51:41.589 --> 51:45.156
as in, "Hey guys, we're
here to pick up the queen".

51:45.158 --> 51:46.725
Well, we could try.

51:46.727 --> 51:48.627
Maybe we could fly there.

51:48.629 --> 51:51.696
Right, and end up being
gobbled up by the vampire?

51:51.698 --> 51:53.732
Might as well put up a big neon
sign:

51:53.734 --> 51:55.536
Free Food! Free Food!

51:56.571 --> 51:57.770
You're right.

51:57.772 --> 51:58.636
We have to...

52:04.277 --> 52:05.678
Larry?

52:05.680 --> 52:07.513
We need to stop Wendy!

52:07.515 --> 52:09.181
The crown has gone to her head.

52:09.183 --> 52:10.649
She's not even thinking
straight!

52:10.651 --> 52:12.183
She's enslaving the worker bees

52:12.185 --> 52:14.185
and threatening the babies!

52:14.187 --> 52:16.154
If she keeps going the hive will
die

52:16.156 --> 52:18.524
and the whole garden with it!

52:18.526 --> 52:19.792
We've no time to lose!

52:19.794 --> 52:21.627
Fiona and Bartley stay here

52:21.629 --> 52:23.029
and keep an eye on things.

52:23.031 --> 52:25.230
Larry and Phoebe, you're with
me.

52:25.232 --> 52:28.100
We'll free Apollo and find the
lair.

52:28.102 --> 52:31.170
Here, a little gift of my own
invention.

52:31.172 --> 52:33.241
You might find it useful.

52:34.274 --> 52:35.477
It's a sword!

52:36.810 --> 52:37.810
Yes, yes!

52:37.812 --> 52:39.281
This is so cool.

52:40.214 --> 52:43.214
My friends, tonight
we're saving our queen.

52:43.216 --> 52:44.419
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

53:10.511 --> 53:13.648
Huh?

53:24.424 --> 53:25.760
Who goes there?

53:32.700 --> 53:33.768
Quick! Run!

53:37.672 --> 53:38.536
Well done!

53:38.538 --> 53:40.138
It worked!

53:40.140 --> 53:42.276
Now let's free our friend.

53:45.346 --> 53:48.513
Psst, don't be afraid, it's me,
Betty!

53:48.515 --> 53:50.216
Oh! Wait!

53:50.218 --> 53:51.750
Miss Betty, I'm innocent!

53:51.752 --> 53:53.384
Wendy framed me!

53:53.386 --> 53:55.353
I know, don't worry.

53:55.355 --> 53:57.690
Phoebe explained everything.

53:57.692 --> 53:59.558
There's one thing you need to
know:

53:59.560 --> 54:01.426
the queen is alive!

54:01.428 --> 54:03.295
Marguerite, alive?

54:03.297 --> 54:04.433
Oh, thank you!

54:05.433 --> 54:06.301
Thank you!

54:07.502 --> 54:08.370
Ouch!

54:11.672 --> 54:15.674
Come on, Apollo, we need to
move fast.

54:15.676 --> 54:16.641
Where are we going?

54:16.643 --> 54:17.775
To save Marguerite!

54:17.777 --> 54:19.448
To save our garden!

54:22.250 --> 54:23.452
Hey, wait up!

54:24.518 --> 54:25.650
You want to attack the Pests?

54:25.652 --> 54:26.618
Yes.

54:26.620 --> 54:29.355
With your help we can do it.

54:29.357 --> 54:30.225
My help?

54:32.926 --> 54:35.527
Oh, don't worry, Apollo.

54:35.529 --> 54:36.730
We can do this.

54:38.466 --> 54:40.868
I can't do anything for you.

54:41.935 --> 54:43.669
I'm sorry, Betty.

54:43.671 --> 54:46.172
I'm the one who doomed the
garden.

54:46.174 --> 54:48.806
If I hadn't taken the
queen to Lover's Corner,

54:48.808 --> 54:50.275
if I hadn't shown off for her

54:50.277 --> 54:51.877
the way I did...

54:51.879 --> 54:54.245
It's not your fault, Apollo,
we've all

54:54.247 --> 54:55.848
been played by Wendy.

54:55.850 --> 54:56.848
No.

54:56.850 --> 55:00.721
I know I'm to blame for
everything, once again.

55:01.656 --> 55:04.723
What do you mean, once again?

55:04.725 --> 55:07.359
Does it have anything
to do with that poster?

55:07.361 --> 55:08.493
What?

55:08.495 --> 55:10.429
The crickets on that poster.

55:10.431 --> 55:12.300
What happened to them?

55:13.401 --> 55:15.201
You know, all gardens are not

55:15.203 --> 55:17.205
as welcoming to artists.

55:21.808 --> 55:25.310
There's even one where
music is strictly forbidden.

55:25.312 --> 55:27.379
One day, I convinced my brothers

55:27.381 --> 55:29.315
to go perform there

55:29.317 --> 55:31.853
with our troupe, The Magic Band.

55:35.355 --> 55:37.223
But it all went wrong.

55:37.225 --> 55:39.290
They set fire to our stage.

55:39.292 --> 55:40.859
You have no right to
be here!

55:40.861 --> 55:43.328
Down with crickets!

55:43.330 --> 55:45.364
Get out!

55:45.366 --> 55:47.333
Crickets have six legs!

55:47.335 --> 55:48.737
Get out!

55:58.678 --> 56:00.578
I understand, Apollo.

56:00.580 --> 56:03.616
You know, I missed my old family
too.

56:03.618 --> 56:05.451
But Queen Marguerite took me in,

56:05.453 --> 56:08.886
even though I was from a
different hive.

56:08.888 --> 56:10.589
I'm sorry, Apollo.

56:10.591 --> 56:12.757
I was wrong about you.

56:12.759 --> 56:15.828
Our garden needs people like
you.

56:15.830 --> 56:17.763
We'll never replace your
brothers,

56:17.765 --> 56:21.969
but from now on you won't
ever be alone, I promise.

56:25.339 --> 56:27.005
Here, take it.

56:27.007 --> 56:28.743
You're worthy of it.

56:46.694 --> 56:47.993
Right!

56:47.995 --> 56:48.861
Come on!

56:48.863 --> 56:50.864
We have a queen to save.

56:55.803 --> 56:57.435
Take the candelabras out of
storage

56:57.437 --> 56:59.871
and deck all the tables in
black.

56:59.873 --> 57:02.775
We'll use mother's silverware.

57:02.777 --> 57:04.576
The venom carafes to dip our
stingers

57:04.578 --> 57:06.045
will go over there.

57:06.047 --> 57:07.513
Don't forget the bouquets.

57:07.515 --> 57:09.948
Let me check the guest list.

57:09.950 --> 57:11.683
The Grand Cross of the Hemlock,

57:11.685 --> 57:14.553
the Order of the Golden Wasps'
Nest.

57:14.555 --> 57:16.855
Wendy, I
just heard

57:16.857 --> 57:18.723
that several villagers have
fled.

57:18.725 --> 57:20.327
What? Who dared?

57:22.430 --> 57:24.062
The little bee who lives by
herself

57:24.064 --> 57:25.730
down in the village.

57:25.732 --> 57:28.766
She tricked the guards
and freed the cricket.

57:28.768 --> 57:30.101
That cricket!

57:30.103 --> 57:32.804
And that nasty little honey bee.

57:32.806 --> 57:34.808
How is it even possible?

57:36.509 --> 57:37.743
Well now, we won't let ourselves

57:37.745 --> 57:40.745
be distracted by such minor
annoyances.

57:40.747 --> 57:44.882
My ball will be the
most grandiose one ever.

57:44.884 --> 57:48.622
Nothing like their
pathetic little jubilees.

58:53.654 --> 58:54.589
We're in!

58:59.093 --> 59:01.562
OK, let's go find Marguerite

59:03.129 --> 59:04.398
very quietly.

59:11.571 --> 59:14.071
It's a shame but sometimes you
have to

59:14.073 --> 59:15.809
make the hard choice

59:16.743 --> 59:19.678
and live with the consequences.

59:22.616 --> 59:23.685
Marguerite!

59:30.658 --> 59:32.491
Come with me.

59:32.493 --> 59:35.460
We need to have a little chat.

59:35.462 --> 59:37.696
I knew you'd make the right
decision.

59:37.698 --> 59:39.630
Hands off my queen, Sphinx
Moth

59:39.632 --> 59:41.732
or I'll give you a taste of...

59:41.734 --> 59:43.000
Apollo?

59:43.002 --> 59:43.868
The cricket's alive?

59:43.870 --> 59:44.738
Apollo!

59:47.507 --> 59:48.806
Marguerite, I'm so sorry!

59:48.808 --> 59:50.141
I didn't know it would end like
this!

59:50.143 --> 59:51.210
Wendy used me!

59:51.212 --> 59:52.944
I know, Apollo, don't worry.

59:52.946 --> 59:53.812
Fear not, Your Majesty,

59:53.814 --> 59:56.013
I will protect you against this
rascal.

59:56.015 --> 59:57.248
Apollo, about that...

59:57.250 --> 59:58.783
No, leave it too me,
Marguerite,

59:58.785 --> 01:00:01.185
this pirate will soon be a
distant memory.

01:00:01.187 --> 01:00:02.721
Ready you knave?

01:00:02.723 --> 01:00:04.223
Attack, parry, attack,

01:00:04.225 --> 01:00:06.725
parry, attack, the fly, the fly

01:00:06.727 --> 01:00:08.960
attack, little step, attack,
feint,

01:00:08.962 --> 01:00:11.596
sidestep, sidestep, principal
feint,

01:00:11.598 --> 01:00:13.098
the splits, attack,

01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:14.533
frog style, frog style, frog
style!

01:00:14.535 --> 01:00:16.167
Marguerite?

01:00:16.169 --> 01:00:17.636
Pas de bourré, pas de
bourré,

01:00:17.638 --> 01:00:18.670
little steps, little steps.

01:00:18.672 --> 01:00:20.004
Sorry.

01:00:20.006 --> 01:00:21.707
Apollo, could I just say?

01:00:21.709 --> 01:00:22.940
Just a sec, dearest,

01:00:22.942 --> 01:00:24.909
I'm getting ready for my secret
thrust!

01:00:24.911 --> 01:00:27.045
Ha-ha, the magic!

01:00:27.047 --> 01:00:27.916
Whoah!

01:00:30.951 --> 01:00:32.551
Nice move!

01:00:32.553 --> 01:00:33.886
Didn't even see it coming.

01:00:33.888 --> 01:00:34.752
Apollo!

01:00:34.754 --> 01:00:37.221
Apollo are you all right?

01:00:37.223 --> 01:00:38.091
Apollo?

01:00:40.227 --> 01:00:43.060
Apollo, can you hear me?

01:00:43.062 --> 01:00:44.131
Marguerite.

01:00:48.701 --> 01:00:50.971
Glad to see you too, Phoebe.

01:00:53.607 --> 01:00:54.476
Hello.

01:00:58.913 --> 01:01:00.312
What's going on here?

01:01:00.314 --> 01:01:01.913
It's all right, Apollo.

01:01:01.915 --> 01:01:05.551
Sphinx Moth has decided to help
us.

01:01:05.553 --> 01:01:08.020
Oh, Marguerite, My Queen!

01:01:08.022 --> 01:01:09.788
I'm so happy to see you again.

01:01:09.790 --> 01:01:11.255
So am I, Apollo,

01:01:11.257 --> 01:01:13.926
I thought I had lost you
forever.

01:01:13.928 --> 01:01:15.794
Here, cricket, have a drink!

01:01:15.796 --> 01:01:16.962
You'll feel better.

01:01:16.964 --> 01:01:17.895
Don't just stand there,

01:01:17.897 --> 01:01:19.998
come and sit with us!

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.699
Oh, all right.

01:01:21.701 --> 01:01:23.000
Thank you, sir.

01:01:23.002 --> 01:01:25.136
Call me Boom, my young friend.

01:01:25.138 --> 01:01:26.073
Daddy Boom.

01:01:28.007 --> 01:01:30.007
So, I can't j-j-jab him any
more then?

01:01:30.009 --> 01:01:31.676
No, don't you understand
anything?

01:01:31.678 --> 01:01:33.245
Leave him alone.

01:01:33.247 --> 01:01:37.315
So, what are you going
to do now, Marguerite?

01:01:37.317 --> 01:01:39.685
We need to take back the hive
tonight.

01:01:39.687 --> 01:01:40.819
We have no other choice.

01:01:40.821 --> 01:01:43.120
Wendy is over-exploiting the
garden.

01:01:43.122 --> 01:01:45.190
She's draining its resources.

01:01:45.192 --> 01:01:46.725
And if she harms the babies

01:01:46.727 --> 01:01:49.060
there won't be anyone to
pollinate the flowers,

01:01:49.062 --> 01:01:52.763
which means no more harvest,
no more royal jelly.

01:01:52.765 --> 01:01:55.167
The hive will die and so will
the garden.

01:01:55.169 --> 01:01:56.701
Even Wendy will have to leave.

01:01:56.703 --> 01:02:00.172
Everything will fall
into ruin and despair.

01:02:00.174 --> 01:02:02.641
It will be the end of the
world.

01:02:02.643 --> 01:02:03.942
I know it seems impossible,

01:02:03.944 --> 01:02:06.078
but we have to do something.

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:06.944
She's right!

01:02:06.946 --> 01:02:07.946
Let's go!

01:02:07.948 --> 01:02:09.681
All right, Apollo!

01:02:09.683 --> 01:02:11.149
We're with you all the
way, Queen Marguerite.

01:02:11.151 --> 01:02:13.620
We're gonna save the garden!

01:02:14.788 --> 01:02:17.254
Thank you my dear friends.

01:02:17.256 --> 01:02:19.790
Those little bugs are totally
nuts!

01:02:19.792 --> 01:02:21.158
But they're as brave as can
be.

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:22.326
Yeah, that's for sure.

01:02:22.328 --> 01:02:23.597
Well, Boss?

01:02:26.933 --> 01:02:28.866
Queen Marguerite, we need the
garden

01:02:28.868 --> 01:02:30.801
just as much as you do.

01:02:30.803 --> 01:02:32.837
And we can't let anyone say the
Pests

01:02:32.839 --> 01:02:34.806
walked away from a good fight!

01:02:34.808 --> 01:02:35.906
Yeah!

01:02:35.908 --> 01:02:37.676
We love a good fight!

01:02:37.678 --> 01:02:38.877
Great speech, Boss!

01:02:38.879 --> 01:02:41.212
D-d-d-definitely right!

01:02:41.214 --> 01:02:43.015
Then it's settled.

01:02:43.017 --> 01:02:45.417
If Your Majesty agrees,

01:02:45.419 --> 01:02:47.689
we'll fight by your side!

01:02:52.426 --> 01:02:56.297
All right then.

01:02:58.098 --> 01:03:01.333
Day bugs and night bugs
will fight side by side.

01:03:01.335 --> 01:03:03.335
Yeah!

01:03:03.337 --> 01:03:05.170
All right, all right!

01:03:05.172 --> 01:03:06.370
That's all well and good

01:03:06.372 --> 01:03:08.873
but we still need a battle plan.

01:03:08.875 --> 01:03:10.341
Sphinx Moth is right.

01:03:10.343 --> 01:03:12.377
Priority number one is
to rescue the babies

01:03:12.379 --> 01:03:14.047
from Wendy's grasp.

01:03:17.116 --> 01:03:19.853
Hey! Are these beauties yours?

01:03:21.388 --> 01:03:22.319
They're mine!

01:03:22.321 --> 01:03:24.191
Old campaign memories.

01:03:25.459 --> 01:03:28.426
But we never planned on
using those against you!

01:03:28.428 --> 01:03:31.328
I saved them for sentimental
reasons.

01:03:31.330 --> 01:03:33.130
We'll be able to create a
diversion,

01:03:33.132 --> 01:03:35.466
but I have to say we're badly
outnumbered.

01:03:35.468 --> 01:03:37.034
Tell me, Sphinx,

01:03:37.036 --> 01:03:40.205
would you happen to know
where that bat hides?

01:03:40.207 --> 01:03:42.741
Ah, of course I do.

01:03:42.743 --> 01:03:45.846
My friends, I believe I have a
plan.

01:03:51.919 --> 01:03:53.321
Please, come in.

01:03:58.024 --> 01:03:58.892
Welcome!

01:04:00.861 --> 01:04:02.226
Hey you nurse!

01:04:02.228 --> 01:04:04.730
Don't just stand there where
the guests can see you.

01:04:04.732 --> 01:04:06.297
Go take care of the babies.

01:04:06.299 --> 01:04:07.701
Come on! Quick!

01:04:08.935 --> 01:04:10.402
And you, lousy Louse.

01:04:10.404 --> 01:04:11.902
Where have you been?

01:04:11.904 --> 01:04:14.042
Go and wait on the guests.

01:04:17.977 --> 01:04:20.846
Finally, a grand wasp ball in
the hive.

01:04:20.848 --> 01:04:23.815
That Wendy is a real
honey-digger.

01:04:23.817 --> 01:04:24.949
Say, I wonder,

01:04:24.951 --> 01:04:27.118
where is the Queen of the Ball?

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:28.120
She's getting ready.

01:04:28.122 --> 01:04:29.857
She'll be down soon.

01:04:38.832 --> 01:04:40.165
Impressive, isn't she?

01:04:40.167 --> 01:04:42.266
That monster is horrible.

01:04:42.268 --> 01:04:45.205
Let's not get her upset, all
right?

01:04:46.906 --> 01:04:49.242
Well, I'll leave you to it.

01:04:54.814 --> 01:04:56.147
Can I jab her now?

01:04:56.149 --> 01:04:57.882
Not now.

01:04:57.884 --> 01:04:58.984
Calm down.

01:04:58.986 --> 01:05:01.455
We have to wait for the signal.

01:05:07.093 --> 01:05:08.161
Here we go!

01:05:10.096 --> 01:05:12.062
Incognito, Buddy,

01:05:12.064 --> 01:05:14.165
you want to do the honours?

01:05:14.167 --> 01:05:15.435
Sir! Yes, sir!

01:05:28.214 --> 01:05:29.948
Oh there you are.

01:05:29.950 --> 01:05:31.348
Is everything ready?

01:05:31.350 --> 01:05:34.287
Yes, everybody's waiting for
you.

01:05:35.189 --> 01:05:37.422
I like to make an entrance.

01:05:37.424 --> 01:05:38.957
What about the buffet?

01:05:38.959 --> 01:05:39.824
Served.

01:05:39.826 --> 01:05:40.491
The crown?

01:05:40.493 --> 01:05:42.127
Displayed.

01:05:42.129 --> 01:05:43.828
And my head?

01:05:43.830 --> 01:05:45.330
Oh you look wonderful.

01:05:45.332 --> 01:05:46.198
That makeup really suits

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:48.098
your graceful features.

01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:50.335
Not my head, you idiot,

01:05:50.337 --> 01:05:51.902
the queen's head!

01:05:51.904 --> 01:05:53.904
Did the Sphinx bring it?

01:05:53.906 --> 01:05:55.977
Um... well, I mean, no.

01:05:57.143 --> 01:05:58.145
Not exactly.

01:05:59.078 --> 01:06:00.948
You... what is that?

01:06:03.584 --> 01:06:04.451
Oh!

01:06:05.419 --> 01:06:06.286
Oh!

01:06:10.323 --> 01:06:12.556
Helium, that's beautiful!

01:06:12.558 --> 01:06:14.025
I love it.

01:06:14.027 --> 01:06:15.963
Did you do that for me?

01:06:17.330 --> 01:06:18.399
Sure I did.

01:06:26.506 --> 01:06:27.973
This way, ladies and
gentlemen.

01:06:27.975 --> 01:06:30.174
Don't miss the fireworks.

01:06:30.176 --> 01:06:30.842
Hey, guys!

01:06:30.844 --> 01:06:32.310
You're missing a great show.

01:06:32.312 --> 01:06:33.314
Come on out!

01:06:42.355 --> 01:06:43.254
Come on, my friends!

01:06:43.256 --> 01:06:44.989
It's time for action.

01:06:44.991 --> 01:06:46.190
Betty?

01:06:46.192 --> 01:06:49.062
Let's take the babies to
safety.

01:06:55.468 --> 01:06:56.336
Follow me!

01:06:58.138 --> 01:06:59.136
Let's go, girls.

01:06:59.138 --> 01:07:00.341
Get the babies.

01:07:07.314 --> 01:07:08.279
That was the signal.

01:07:08.281 --> 01:07:09.883
OK then, let's go.

01:07:14.053 --> 01:07:16.587
- Can I jab her now?
- Shh.

01:07:16.589 --> 01:07:19.056
- Yeah, but can I jab?
- Shh.

01:07:19.058 --> 01:07:20.125
- Jab her now?
- Shh.

01:07:20.127 --> 01:07:21.326
- Jab her?
- Shh.

01:07:21.328 --> 01:07:24.295
- Jab, jab, jab?
- Shh, shh, shh!

01:07:24.297 --> 01:07:25.232
OK, fine!

01:07:29.136 --> 01:07:30.004
Wake up!

01:07:36.410 --> 01:07:37.277
Ha-ha!

01:07:39.478 --> 01:07:41.482
Oh, boy, oh boy, oh boy!

01:07:43.582 --> 01:07:44.517
OK, steady!

01:07:47.087 --> 01:07:49.023
Okay, steady, nice bat!

01:07:52.024 --> 01:07:52.690
Yeah, go left!

01:07:52.692 --> 01:07:54.025
No, your other left.

01:07:54.027 --> 01:07:55.025
No, go down!

01:07:55.027 --> 01:07:56.962
That's one crazy cricket.

01:07:56.964 --> 01:07:59.563
Coming from you, I
know that's a compliment.

01:07:59.565 --> 01:08:00.397
It's all right,

01:08:00.399 --> 01:08:02.232
I think she's starting to like
me.

01:08:02.234 --> 01:08:03.236
Turn around!

01:08:06.372 --> 01:08:07.407
It's working!

01:08:09.276 --> 01:08:10.944
I meant to do that!

01:08:15.181 --> 01:08:17.082
Oops! So what do we do now?

01:08:17.084 --> 01:08:20.584
We might need to find a new
cricket.

01:08:20.586 --> 01:08:22.185
There we go!

01:08:22.188 --> 01:08:24.520
It wasn't that hard, was it?

01:08:24.523 --> 01:08:26.323
Yes, who's my good girl?

01:08:26.326 --> 01:08:27.194
Yes.

01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:31.232
And now, let's move out, to the
hive!

01:08:34.367 --> 01:08:35.236
Yee-ha!

01:08:37.371 --> 01:08:38.337
Should we follow him?

01:08:38.339 --> 01:08:40.437
Hahaha, of course we should
follow him!

01:08:40.439 --> 01:08:41.308
Come on!

01:08:50.250 --> 01:08:52.053
The coast is clear.

01:09:03.697 --> 01:09:06.167
Oh, will you look at that!

01:09:09.702 --> 01:09:10.571
What?

01:09:12.805 --> 01:09:14.538
Guards!

01:09:14.541 --> 01:09:17.174
Can't we at least wait
for the grand finale?

01:09:17.176 --> 01:09:18.042
No, you idiot!

01:09:18.045 --> 01:09:18.910
Look!

01:09:18.912 --> 01:09:22.446
They're taking their brats out
of here!

01:09:22.448 --> 01:09:23.380
Guards! Guards!

01:09:23.381 --> 01:09:25.716
Everyone, after them!

01:09:25.719 --> 01:09:28.484
Betty, all the babies
are out of harm's way.

01:09:28.487 --> 01:09:29.654
Soldiers!

01:09:29.656 --> 01:09:31.256
Take no prisoners!

01:09:35.295 --> 01:09:37.493
Party's over, you microbes!

01:09:37.496 --> 01:09:39.063
In the name of the Hive!

01:09:39.064 --> 01:09:40.600
Not one more step!

01:09:44.703 --> 01:09:46.040
Squash them!

01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:54.512
It's going to be a real drama!

01:09:54.514 --> 01:09:55.213
I know.

01:09:55.215 --> 01:09:58.149
This is so much fun!

01:10:11.864 --> 01:10:12.730
That's Apollo!

01:10:12.732 --> 01:10:14.231
He did it!

01:10:14.233 --> 01:10:15.100
The cricket?

01:10:15.102 --> 01:10:16.037
Impossible!

01:10:18.170 --> 01:10:19.369
We are the Pests!

01:10:19.371 --> 01:10:21.107
It's bad we do best!

01:10:22.408 --> 01:10:25.375
We sleep all day, by night we
play

01:10:25.377 --> 01:10:26.377
We'll steal your stuff

01:10:26.379 --> 01:10:27.448
and fly away!

01:10:29.448 --> 01:10:30.815
You'd better hide,

01:10:30.817 --> 01:10:32.819
because tonight we ride!

01:10:33.854 --> 01:10:37.058
We are the best, and we aint'
pests!

01:10:53.273 --> 01:10:54.138
Now, Boss?

01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:54.806
Can I jab them?

01:10:54.808 --> 01:10:55.707
Oh yes Mickey!

01:10:55.709 --> 01:10:56.374
J-jab now!

01:10:56.376 --> 01:10:58.778
Now you can jab them all!

01:11:04.584 --> 01:11:06.316
Listen, my bug friends,

01:11:06.318 --> 01:11:07.685
you've been lied to!

01:11:07.687 --> 01:11:10.554
Queen Marguerite is alive!

01:11:10.556 --> 01:11:12.425
The Wasp Ball is over!

01:11:13.393 --> 01:11:16.330
Now it's time for the Vampire
Ball.

01:11:19.632 --> 01:11:20.501
What?

01:11:28.575 --> 01:11:31.578
Sorry, ladies, the hive is
closed.

01:11:32.778 --> 01:11:34.779
I'm sorry, what?

01:11:34.781 --> 01:11:36.280
What was that?

01:11:36.282 --> 01:11:37.617
I can't hear you!

01:11:39.653 --> 01:11:41.589
Now, onto the real job.

01:11:46.492 --> 01:11:48.560
Gentlemen, would you be so kind

01:11:48.562 --> 01:11:50.895
as to give me back the crown,

01:11:50.897 --> 01:11:55.200
of which I am the one and only
guardian?

01:11:55.202 --> 01:11:58.472
Oh, so we'll have to do it the
hard way.

01:12:09.715 --> 01:12:10.584
Yeah!

01:12:13.819 --> 01:12:15.320
Haha!

01:12:15.322 --> 01:12:16.820
Oooh ah!

01:12:16.822 --> 01:12:18.489
Aa, yoom!

01:12:18.491 --> 01:12:21.362
Tink!

01:12:24.230 --> 01:12:26.297
There you are, you big bully!

01:12:26.299 --> 01:12:28.499
Now it's between you and me.

01:12:32.272 --> 01:12:32.936
My army!

01:12:32.938 --> 01:12:34.874
Call in reinforcements!

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:43.714
Brave soldiers of the hive,

01:12:43.716 --> 01:12:46.484
let's show them what we're made
of!

01:12:46.486 --> 01:12:47.321
Yeah!

01:12:53.827 --> 01:12:56.697
These bees are a real
buzz-kill.

01:13:01.367 --> 01:13:02.635
Somebody help!

01:13:23.822 --> 01:13:26.591
You're getting too old
for this type of thing.

01:13:42.375 --> 01:13:43.874
Is that all you've got, Grandpa?

01:13:50.983 --> 01:13:52.652
Now, where were we?

01:13:54.953 --> 01:13:56.954
Oh yes, I was about

01:13:56.956 --> 01:13:58.892
to give the final blow.

01:14:01.961 --> 01:14:04.965
So, it's that all you've got,
kid?

01:14:07.666 --> 01:14:09.667
This isn't over yet.

01:14:09.669 --> 01:14:10.537
Take that.

01:14:17.344 --> 01:14:18.042
No!

01:14:18.044 --> 01:14:19.444
No,

01:14:19.446 --> 01:14:20.314
No!

01:14:23.882 --> 01:14:25.482
It's over, Wendy.

01:14:25.484 --> 01:14:27.352
You? But how?

01:14:27.354 --> 01:14:29.619
Call yourself queen all you
want

01:14:29.621 --> 01:14:32.623
but you don't know half
the secrets of the hive.

01:14:32.625 --> 01:14:34.560
It's time to surrender.

01:14:35.495 --> 01:14:38.899
Do you think I'll be captured
so easily?

01:14:42.001 --> 01:14:43.767
Do we have a plan B?

01:14:43.769 --> 01:14:44.705
Uh... no.

01:14:49.041 --> 01:14:50.641
When you want something done
right,

01:14:50.643 --> 01:14:53.677
you have to do it yourself.

01:14:54.714 --> 01:14:55.783
Marguerite!

01:14:58.050 --> 01:14:59.852
Don't let go of me!

01:15:03.822 --> 01:15:06.626
Will you stop your wacko
dance?

01:15:07.727 --> 01:15:08.562
No, no!

01:15:10.596 --> 01:15:11.262
Apollo!

01:15:11.264 --> 01:15:12.129
Marguerite, save yourself!

01:15:12.131 --> 01:15:14.699
I'll take care of her.

01:15:14.701 --> 01:15:17.668
Your reign of terror ends now,
Wendy.

01:15:17.670 --> 01:15:19.736
That's what you think,
cricket.

01:15:19.738 --> 01:15:20.838
No, I really mean it.

01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:22.740
I will squash you!

01:15:22.742 --> 01:15:25.075
Attack, parry, attack, parry

01:15:25.077 --> 01:15:26.843
attack, the fly, the fly,

01:15:26.845 --> 01:15:28.812
little step, little step,
attack,

01:15:28.814 --> 01:15:30.481
feint, bicycle step,

01:15:30.483 --> 01:15:31.816
splits, the fly,

01:15:31.818 --> 01:15:33.151
pas de bourré, pas de bourré!

01:15:33.153 --> 01:15:35.686
You're really starting to bug
me.

01:15:35.688 --> 01:15:37.155
I'll take that as a
compliment.

01:15:37.157 --> 01:15:38.025
Enough!

01:15:40.859 --> 01:15:42.462
Let's finish this.

01:15:47.434 --> 01:15:48.633
You filthy cricket!

01:15:48.635 --> 01:15:49.770
Will you stop?

01:15:51.004 --> 01:15:51.872
Not bad.

01:15:53.505 --> 01:15:56.676
It's a shame there's no ball
after all.

01:15:57.609 --> 01:15:58.776
No!

01:15:58.778 --> 01:15:59.843
Apollo!

01:15:59.845 --> 01:16:01.447
Marguerite! Run!

01:16:07.187 --> 01:16:08.654
Wendy! Please!

01:16:09.721 --> 01:16:11.888
Don't do this, you don't have to
be...

01:16:11.890 --> 01:16:12.990
A wasp?

01:16:12.992 --> 01:16:14.959
Is that what you wanted to say?

01:16:14.961 --> 01:16:17.462
An outcast that cannot be
trusted?

01:16:17.464 --> 01:16:19.466
Kept away from the hive?

01:16:21.568 --> 01:16:24.201
I know you've always felt
rejected.

01:16:24.203 --> 01:16:26.236
I made mistakes.

01:16:26.238 --> 01:16:28.239
I learned that these last few
days

01:16:28.241 --> 01:16:29.609
with the Pests.

01:16:31.044 --> 01:16:34.911
All little bugs should live
together.

01:16:34.913 --> 01:16:37.451
There's still time to change.

01:16:41.086 --> 01:16:43.186
No! It's too late!

01:16:43.188 --> 01:16:44.655
The hive is mine!

01:16:44.657 --> 01:16:45.659
Wendy, no!

01:16:47.126 --> 01:16:48.595
Oh no, Apollo!

01:16:50.196 --> 01:16:51.195
Apollo!

01:16:51.197 --> 01:16:53.196
I'm all right, my Queen!

01:16:53.198 --> 01:16:54.999
Well, for the moment.

01:16:55.001 --> 01:16:55.967
All right, cricket,

01:16:55.969 --> 01:16:57.502
any last words?

01:16:57.504 --> 01:16:59.536
Dinner is served?

01:17:00.672 --> 01:17:02.075
No! Ugh!

01:17:03.643 --> 01:17:05.578
Yeah! That's my girl!

01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:10.616
Let go of me, you mangy beast!

01:17:12.285 --> 01:17:13.153
No!

01:17:14.854 --> 01:17:15.789
No, please!

01:17:16.889 --> 01:17:17.757
No!

01:17:19.192 --> 01:17:21.795
Untie me, come on, untie me.

01:17:24.029 --> 01:17:25.663
No, wait, may I?

01:17:25.665 --> 01:17:27.164
This one's mine.

01:17:27.166 --> 01:17:30.000
We have a little score to
settle.

01:17:30.002 --> 01:17:32.035
We can talk about this.

01:17:32.037 --> 01:17:33.838
No, not the grand finale!

01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:34.708
Not that!

01:17:53.091 --> 01:17:55.560
This is so beautiful.

01:17:55.562 --> 01:17:56.897
Yes, beautiful.

01:18:12.211 --> 01:18:13.080
Huh?

01:18:33.866 --> 01:18:36.200
We love you, Queen
Marguerite!

01:18:36.202 --> 01:18:37.871
Queen, we love you!

01:18:40.340 --> 01:18:43.074
Life in the garden will
finally return to normal.

01:18:43.076 --> 01:18:45.209
You can rule the hive again.

01:18:45.211 --> 01:18:48.745
Well, to be frank, my loveable
louse,

01:18:48.747 --> 01:18:53.019
I think that I have other
plans for the near future.

01:18:54.053 --> 01:18:56.020
A nice long trip maybe?

01:18:56.022 --> 01:18:57.754
What? Really?

01:18:57.756 --> 01:18:59.356
You want to hand over the crown?

01:18:59.358 --> 01:19:00.223
Why not?

01:19:00.225 --> 01:19:02.159
I want to see the world

01:19:02.161 --> 01:19:05.899
and I want to tend to
my own private garden.

01:19:07.265 --> 01:19:08.999
There's only one problem:

01:19:09.001 --> 01:19:10.301
if our beloved queen no longer
wants

01:19:10.303 --> 01:19:11.901
to be queen,

01:19:11.903 --> 01:19:14.170
then who shall take her
place on the throne?

01:19:14.172 --> 01:19:15.405
Oh, don't worry.

01:19:15.407 --> 01:19:16.240
I think we've already found

01:19:16.242 --> 01:19:19.279
the perfect candidate, haven't
we?

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:22.045
What?

01:19:22.047 --> 01:19:24.651
Me?

01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:29.186
So there we are, children.

01:19:29.188 --> 01:19:32.789
That's the story of how I became
Queen.

01:19:32.791 --> 01:19:34.959
And how our beautiful garden
found

01:19:34.961 --> 01:19:37.227
peace and harmony again.

01:19:37.229 --> 01:19:38.329
But, but..

01:19:38.331 --> 01:19:42.066
But Queen Betty, what about
Marguerite and Apollo?

01:19:42.068 --> 01:19:43.937
What happened to them?

01:19:45.404 --> 01:19:49.073
Hmm, that, my dear
children, is another story.
