-Woo hoo!
-Wooo!

00:13.013 --> 00:15.015
[laughter]

00:15.265 --> 00:16.725
Time to blaze the tower.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.271
Alright let's go. I gotta take
a massive shit.

00:22.647 --> 00:24.482
-Woo hoo!
-Yeah!

Skull.

00:27.944 --> 00:29.362
[laughter]

00:36.619 --> 00:37.454
Clippers?

00:37.829 --> 00:39.164
I don't have any Clippers.

00:39.289 --> 00:40.123
Clippers?

00:40.248 --> 00:41.666
I didn't bring any clippers.

00:42.042 --> 00:42.876
Guys.

00:43.334 --> 00:44.836
It's so far back down.

00:44.919 --> 00:45.879
[sighs]

00:47.213 --> 00:48.965
[panting]

00:49.299 --> 00:50.133
Clippers.

00:50.341 --> 00:51.176
Clippers.

00:53.219 --> 00:54.220
Yeah, Little Man.

00:54.971 --> 00:55.805
Yeah.

00:56.765 --> 00:57.932
-Woooo!
-Woo hoo!

00:58.016 --> 01:00.602
-I can't believe we're doing this.
-100 percent pure adrenaline.

01:00.685 --> 01:03.021
-Let's do the check! You good?
-Oh yeah, check! You good.

01:03.104 --> 01:04.439
-You're good.
-You're checked.

01:04.731 --> 01:06.024
-I'm good.
-Yeah.

01:06.107 --> 01:07.358
-Yeah.
-You? You're solid. Check.

01:07.484 --> 01:08.943
-You're good.
-Check. You're good?

01:09.027 --> 01:09.903
All right. All right.

01:10.028 --> 01:12.030
-Woo hooo hooo!
-[screams]

01:18.620 --> 01:19.704
Daredevil Trio!

01:19.829 --> 01:21.748
Yeah!

01:21.831 --> 01:24.250
Yeah!

01:27.629 --> 01:31.174
[AWOLNATION - "Sail" playing on radio]

01:38.723 --> 01:40.725
-Woo hoo hoo!
-[laughter]

01:41.810 --> 01:44.062
[scream of joy]

01:44.813 --> 01:45.647
Thank God!

01:46.523 --> 01:47.398
I love you, baby!

01:47.482 --> 01:49.150
I love you! Let's go.

01:49.234 --> 01:51.236
Woo!

02:01.037 --> 02:02.747
Here you are. Bon appetite!

02:03.206 --> 02:04.124
Thank you.

02:04.582 --> 02:07.085
-I like what you've done with the place.
-Oh, yeah.

02:07.627 --> 02:10.839
Yep. This place is not born of self-hatred
and guilt at all.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.341
[chuckles]
I wouldn't know anything about that.

02:13.424 --> 02:15.426
[both chuckle]

02:15.927 --> 02:18.513
Have you ever thought about
hanging a picture up on that wall?

02:19.222 --> 02:20.306
Actually, I have.

02:30.191 --> 02:32.110
It looks like you're a serial killer

02:32.193 --> 02:34.237
-and I'm your next victim.
-It certainly does.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.072
Morning, love birds.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.031
Jesus Chris.

02:37.115 --> 02:39.909
So Ethan, are you going to introduce me
to your girlfriend?

02:39.993 --> 02:41.828
Oh, no, it's not like that. We're not--

02:41.911 --> 02:43.079
It's not that. It's-- we're--

02:43.163 --> 02:44.497
We're actually- we're not the--

02:44.581 --> 02:46.541
So this is more loosey-goosey?

02:46.624 --> 02:47.667
Well, not--

02:47.750 --> 02:49.419
not entirely loosey-goosey.

02:49.544 --> 02:51.546
Well...you-- it's a...

02:51.671 --> 02:52.755
little loosey-goosey.

02:52.839 --> 02:55.133
No, you're right. It's real loosey-goosey.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.217
I mean it's not...

02:56.342 --> 02:58.386
entirely loosey-goosey, right?

02:58.469 --> 03:02.223
I think-- I think what Sam's trying to say
is that it's somewhat but not entirely

03:02.307 --> 03:03.141
loosey-goosey.

03:03.433 --> 03:04.267
Is that right?

03:04.392 --> 03:07.520
I don't understand why
we are discussing this with...

03:07.937 --> 03:08.771
With this guy.

03:09.063 --> 03:09.898
Alan.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.650
With Alan. We haven't even discussed it
ourselves.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.694
-No, I understand.
-I gotta go.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.154
Sam?

03:18.948 --> 03:21.910
So are you two together or not?

03:22.285 --> 03:23.244
I don't know, Alan.

03:23.995 --> 03:24.954
Okay? I don't know.

03:26.456 --> 03:27.874
Trouble in paradise.

03:27.957 --> 03:29.334
[Ethan sighs]

03:33.588 --> 03:34.672
Okay, so...

03:35.590 --> 03:38.509
it was nice meet you, Alan, and
I'll give you a call.

03:38.593 --> 03:39.928
Please. Call me later.

03:40.178 --> 03:41.596
Yeah. Bye.

03:42.305 --> 03:43.139
Bye, hon.

03:44.599 --> 03:45.934
I think you crept her out.

03:49.812 --> 03:52.023
-Hey, Liz, before you go...
-Yeah, what's up?

03:52.106 --> 03:53.816
Do you know what your problem is?

03:54.484 --> 03:55.735
What is my problem?

03:55.818 --> 03:57.820
-You're a user.
-Okay, I'm a user.

03:58.154 --> 04:00.615
Yeah. Now you need a sperm doner,
you find me.

04:00.698 --> 04:02.200
You need a mover, you find this clown.

04:02.325 --> 04:04.661
You have a guy in your back pocket
for every occasion.

04:04.744 --> 04:06.746
You're a user. That's who you are.

04:06.871 --> 04:09.249
Well, dude. I know this sucks.

04:09.332 --> 04:10.458
But, be cool.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.252
[mocking laughter] Okay.

04:12.669 --> 04:13.962
You want me to be cool?

04:14.629 --> 04:16.547
'Cause I'm super cool, man.

04:18.007 --> 04:18.883
I'm super cool.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.443
I'm sorry. That wasn't cool.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.238
You guys should go.

04:42.615 --> 04:43.574
Jesus.

04:43.908 --> 04:45.743
He started out so cool for a minute,

04:46.035 --> 04:48.496
then he just became so uncool. You know?

04:51.291 --> 04:52.125
Hey.

04:52.458 --> 04:53.293
How are you?

04:53.626 --> 04:55.712
Oh, wow. Where's Max?

04:55.837 --> 04:56.754
Max isn't coming.

04:56.838 --> 04:57.797
Oh, I thought--

04:58.631 --> 05:00.967
I thought that the three of us
were having lunch together.

05:01.050 --> 05:03.011
No. I asked you here

05:03.136 --> 05:06.431
because I wanted to discuss
your writing partnership with Max.

05:06.764 --> 05:08.558
What? My writing partnership?

05:08.641 --> 05:10.560
No, we don't have a writing partnership.

05:10.643 --> 05:12.729
If he's contributing half the ideas,

05:12.812 --> 05:16.024
then his name should be next to yours
on the book as a co-writer.

05:16.107 --> 05:17.483
-Did Max tell you to say this?
-No.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.402
No. He has no idea.

05:20.069 --> 05:22.196
But, it's really bothering him.

05:22.572 --> 05:25.033
He says he comes up
with all of your ideas.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.869
[scoffs]
Well, I'm sorry, but that's ridiculous.

05:29.746 --> 05:30.580
Sorry.

05:31.873 --> 05:32.957
You took notes?

05:33.041 --> 05:36.169
Yes, but Max got you into YA,

05:36.419 --> 05:40.214
and he suggested all the source material
for your last two novels.

05:40.298 --> 05:42.925
He's been instrumental
in every part of this process.

05:43.009 --> 05:44.427
He deserves to be co-writer.

05:44.510 --> 05:47.347
I honestly don't know what to say.

05:47.472 --> 05:48.681
I-- I mean, this is

05:48.765 --> 05:50.767
wildly inappropriate and--

05:50.850 --> 05:53.353
and I'm sorry, I'm having a hard time
responding.

05:53.436 --> 05:54.562
What I think is inappropriate

05:54.645 --> 05:56.522
is how you push him around
like a little brother,

05:56.606 --> 05:59.317
which may have been your dynamic
in college, but it can't continue.

05:59.400 --> 06:02.278
-What is that supposed to mean?
-Do you watch  Ray Donovan?

06:02.403 --> 06:03.988
-What?
- Ray Donovan?

06:04.405 --> 06:05.406
He's a fixer.

06:06.699 --> 06:08.701
I'm fixing this... for Max.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.161
I'm fixing the situation

06:10.244 --> 06:12.580
because it's very upsetting to him,

06:12.663 --> 06:13.915
and we're getting married

06:14.123 --> 06:16.959
and I love him and I want to protect him.

06:17.668 --> 06:19.087
from, you know,

06:20.463 --> 06:21.297
his friends.

06:22.673 --> 06:24.008
Well, you know,

06:24.133 --> 06:25.927
if Max has something to say,

06:26.052 --> 06:29.013
then maybe he should come
and say it to me himself.

06:29.097 --> 06:30.139
Well, he tried,

06:30.306 --> 06:32.266
and then you started doing those...

06:33.518 --> 06:34.477
voices.

06:35.603 --> 06:37.021
-Look.
-Just give him credit.

06:37.105 --> 06:38.564
It's the right thing to do.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.608
-Have you ever seen the show  The Closer?
-What?

06:40.691 --> 06:43.861
The Closer  . 'Cause that's a TV show, too.
I'm closing this.

06:44.153 --> 06:45.780
-I'm the closer.
-I'm the fixer.

06:45.863 --> 06:47.156
There's no closer.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.825
I'm closing it. I'm closing--

06:48.908 --> 06:49.867
I fixed it

06:50.159 --> 06:51.661
Yeah. Closing. Closing.

06:51.744 --> 06:53.329
Hold on, I-- Hold on.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.290
I have something else here I wrote
I wanted to say.

06:59.752 --> 07:01.003
Oh, yeah, I fixed it.

07:01.212 --> 07:02.046
Jesus.

07:02.922 --> 07:05.383
I think Dash has really grown
into his own this year.

07:05.466 --> 07:07.677
He has a lot of personality.

07:07.760 --> 07:08.970
-Yes, he does.
-[both chuckle]

07:09.053 --> 07:12.723
But he's made a lot of improvements
managing his moods and his emotions.

07:12.807 --> 07:13.891
That is so great.

07:13.975 --> 07:16.936
He's just-- he's enjoyed his year
in your classroom so much,

07:17.019 --> 07:17.854
-Ms. Chelsea.
-I know.

07:17.937 --> 07:19.272
He talks about you all the time.

07:19.355 --> 07:20.982
Ms. Chelsea this, Ms. Chelsea that.

07:21.065 --> 07:22.608
He's such a cutie.

07:22.733 --> 07:25.778
Well, you have a great summer,
and thank you again so much.

07:25.945 --> 07:27.321
Okay, Chels.

07:29.866 --> 07:31.951
Am I gonna pick you up,
or do we meet there?

07:32.118 --> 07:34.162
-If you could pick me up, that'd be great.
-Oh, sure.

07:34.370 --> 07:36.372
- You left that thing at my house. The--
-Oh, shoot.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.624
-I can bring it. Alright.
-Please do. Oh, you-- [giggles]

07:38.708 --> 07:39.625
Let's go.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.419
-Okay.
-Come on. Let's go.

07:41.586 --> 07:42.420
Come on.

07:44.255 --> 07:45.423
-Bye.
-Bye.

07:45.548 --> 07:46.382
Bye.

07:48.593 --> 07:49.719
Don't worry. I got it.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.637
That was all good news.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.389
Ms. Chelsea likes him.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.432
-John.
-What?

07:54.557 --> 07:55.766
What just happened in there?

07:55.850 --> 07:57.518
-What?
-Are you dating Ms. Chelsea?

07:57.852 --> 07:58.978
Chels? Well...

07:59.270 --> 08:01.105
Yeah. I mean-- I told you that.

08:01.189 --> 08:02.190
No, you didn't.

08:02.815 --> 08:04.817
Yeah, I did. You must have forgotten.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.360
No, you didn't tell me.

08:06.527 --> 08:09.322
Okay. Well, I'm dating Ms. Chelsea.
There, I--

08:09.405 --> 08:10.740
-Hey. Hi.
-Hi.

08:11.032 --> 08:12.867
Yeah. I could see how, so...

08:12.950 --> 08:14.994
There. Consider yourself told.

08:15.203 --> 08:18.080
She is literally the only person
you cannot date.

08:18.164 --> 08:19.540
I can date whoever I want to date.

08:19.707 --> 08:21.042
She's in the kids' lives.

08:21.125 --> 08:23.085
-She-- so what? Hi.
-Hi.

08:23.961 --> 08:26.339
Choose anyone besides their teacher or...

08:26.589 --> 08:27.423
Or my sister.

08:27.590 --> 08:29.509
[scoffs] God, your sister. She wishes.

08:29.634 --> 08:30.510
[chuckles]

08:30.593 --> 08:32.345
What? You don't get to decide this.

08:32.428 --> 08:34.305
-Does Dashiell know?
-Of course he doesn't know.

08:34.472 --> 08:37.141
I'm an adult. I have boundaries.
I'm not gonna tell the kids.

08:37.225 --> 08:39.018
Besides, it would break his heart, I mean,

08:39.101 --> 08:40.102
He wants to marry her. Ha!

08:40.394 --> 08:41.229
You know that.

08:41.479 --> 08:43.648
You really don't see what's wrong
with this?

08:43.731 --> 08:44.565
Please.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.859
Thank you so much
for letting me stay here.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.486
-Yeah.
-I'll be out of here ASAP.

08:48.569 --> 08:50.446
No. Please. Stay as long as you want.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.781
Oh, well, let me do that.

08:51.864 --> 08:54.200
-I'll sleep on the couch.
-No. No. Come on.

08:54.575 --> 08:55.785
You take the bed. Okay?

08:55.910 --> 08:56.911
-Really?
-Yes.

08:56.994 --> 08:57.828
Okay.

09:00.915 --> 09:03.376
Hey, did you think what Charlie said
was true?

09:03.459 --> 09:04.585
Do you think that I...

09:05.002 --> 09:06.170
that I use men?

09:06.379 --> 09:07.338
You use men?

09:08.047 --> 09:08.923
No, I don't--

09:09.590 --> 09:10.925
I don't think you use men.

09:11.717 --> 09:13.469
I don't know why he would say that.

09:14.011 --> 09:14.845
I think he's...

09:15.555 --> 09:17.682
I think he's probably just hurt, you know?

09:19.934 --> 09:21.769
It's like-- sucks to be the rebound.

09:22.019 --> 09:24.981
But I would never say you use men.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.651
-Well, goodnight.
-Yeah.

09:28.734 --> 09:30.319
Again, thank you so much.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.405
Yeah, of course. Please.

09:34.657 --> 09:35.491
FUN BOY

09:37.577 --> 09:38.703
Erm..
