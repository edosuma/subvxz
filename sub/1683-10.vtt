00:02.669 --> 00:04.269
<i>Previously on</i> sleepy hollow:
Parrish: <i>What's this about?</i>

00:04.271 --> 00:05.938
Who are you?
I'm katrina crane.

00:05.940 --> 00:06.972
This is a dream?

00:06.974 --> 00:09.108
You're the man abbie
told me about.

00:09.110 --> 00:10.776
Abbie:
<i>The sin eater.</i>

00:10.778 --> 00:14.880
A family tree.
You're a descendant
of grace dixon.

00:14.882 --> 00:17.449
It's time.
Abbie: <i>I saw katrina</i>
<i>giving birth.</i>

00:17.451 --> 00:19.051
My son. (cries)
what did you say?

00:19.053 --> 00:20.152
I had a vision.

00:20.154 --> 00:24.123
I'm sorry,
you must be mistaken.

00:24.125 --> 00:26.625
She would have told me.

00:26.627 --> 00:29.294
She needed to keep it secret.

00:29.296 --> 00:32.364
What happened to my son?

00:35.301 --> 00:37.736
(vehicle approaches)

00:38.671 --> 00:39.772
(engine shuts off)

00:45.078 --> 00:47.513
Chopping down a
christmas tree?

00:47.515 --> 00:51.083
An altogether
nonsensical concept.

00:51.085 --> 00:54.686
Celebrating yuletide with
a titular display of lumber.

00:54.688 --> 00:57.556
Wow. Bah, humbug
to you, too, ebenezer.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.058
That was all gibberish.

00:59.060 --> 01:00.059
Scrooge.

01:00.061 --> 01:01.894
He's a dickensian character.

01:01.896 --> 01:03.262
A grump.

01:03.264 --> 01:04.530
Well, you guys had
christmas, right?

01:04.532 --> 01:05.531
Santa claus...

01:05.533 --> 01:08.500
Snowmen... Eggnog.

01:09.602 --> 01:12.938
In my era, the term
was "egg and grog."

01:12.940 --> 01:15.441
A draught made of rum
that led inevitably

01:15.443 --> 01:17.576
To an aching head,
ergo, "noggin."

01:17.578 --> 01:19.178
Abbreviated to "nog."

01:23.783 --> 01:24.950
I get why you're upset.

01:24.952 --> 01:27.920
Do you, now?

01:27.922 --> 01:29.955
You find out you had a son...

01:29.957 --> 01:32.124
And you never
got to know him.

01:32.126 --> 01:35.461
I am sorry, crane.

01:35.463 --> 01:38.363
If I were you, I'd be taking
an ax to something, too.

01:38.365 --> 01:41.233
My head is swimming
with questions.

01:41.235 --> 01:43.769
What was he like?

01:43.771 --> 01:46.872
What did he know of me?

01:46.874 --> 01:48.841
How did he live?

01:52.579 --> 01:55.914
And why did katrina not tell me
she was with child?

01:55.916 --> 01:58.984
She put you in that cave
to protect you.

01:58.986 --> 02:03.455
I got to assume she kept it
a secret for the same reason.

02:03.457 --> 02:08.127
Moloch hunted them both down
centuries ago.

02:08.129 --> 02:10.262
While I'm yet
to know the reason,

02:10.264 --> 02:12.898
It suggests that
their fates will come to bear

02:12.900 --> 02:15.100
In our war against him now.

02:15.102 --> 02:18.904
That is why we must find out
what happened to my son.

02:18.906 --> 02:21.840
And we shall start by
endeavoring to contact katrina.

02:21.842 --> 02:23.976
How do you plan
on doing that, exactly?

02:23.978 --> 02:26.245
When she came to me,
it seemed like

02:26.247 --> 02:28.847
She had to move mountains
to do it.

02:29.916 --> 02:32.017
Those are some
pretty freaky mountains.

02:32.019 --> 02:33.418
(car approaches)

02:35.955 --> 02:37.689
You expecting company?

02:37.691 --> 02:39.825
Indeed.

02:39.827 --> 02:42.861
The only man I know capable
of moving freaky mountains.

02:42.863 --> 02:44.496
(car door opens)

02:45.865 --> 02:47.633
You called parrish? Why?

02:47.635 --> 02:49.868
Put yourself in my place.

02:49.870 --> 02:52.104
How far would you go
for answers?

02:52.106 --> 02:54.072
All the way.

02:56.976 --> 03:00.145
Mr. Parrish,
thank you for coming.

03:00.147 --> 03:02.714
Don't touch me, please.

03:04.317 --> 03:06.852
Apologies, mr. Crane.

03:06.854 --> 03:09.688
It's not a good idea
to touch me.

03:09.690 --> 03:12.124
Of course.

03:12.126 --> 03:14.059
I appreciate
your hasty arrival.

03:15.895 --> 03:17.296
Shall we venture indoors?

03:18.831 --> 03:20.299
Parrish:
<i>Well, I'm sorry</i>
<i>to disappoint you.</i>

03:20.301 --> 03:21.700
<i>I'm a sin eater;</i>

03:21.702 --> 03:24.803
I-I-I can read, and at times,

03:24.805 --> 03:26.538
Remove sins, that's all.

03:26.540 --> 03:27.973
No, that's not all.

03:27.975 --> 03:30.242
You have the power
to reach across realms.

03:30.244 --> 03:33.078
You summoned a man long dead
and brought him to me.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.346
Summon him!

03:34.348 --> 03:36.215
With all your heart!

03:36.217 --> 03:38.850
Here into this room!

03:38.852 --> 03:41.186
Now open your eyes.

03:41.188 --> 03:43.889
You must have the ability
to reach katrina.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.090
Purgatory.

03:48.761 --> 03:50.896
It isn't anything
I've ever tried before.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.497
Please.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.067
I beg you.

03:55.069 --> 03:56.668
Yeah, all right.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.870
I'll make an attempt.
That's all I can promise.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.906
I've never used my gift

04:00.908 --> 04:03.408
For a purpose
beyond removing sins.

04:03.410 --> 04:05.611
Now, you listen very carefully.

04:05.613 --> 04:07.946
A mortal soul
has no place

04:07.948 --> 04:10.882
In the realm of the dead.

04:10.884 --> 04:12.884
Your life will be in danger.

04:12.886 --> 04:16.288
I will have to put it in danger.

04:16.290 --> 04:17.756
I understand the risk.

04:17.758 --> 04:20.259
(chuckling):
Oh, no, you don't.

04:20.261 --> 04:23.795
Our lives are a tapestry.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.430
Each moment

04:25.432 --> 04:30.035
Is a thread upon which
the next thread is woven.

04:30.037 --> 04:31.703
When you reach

04:31.705 --> 04:32.971
Beyond this existence,

04:32.973 --> 04:36.375
As you're about to,
you are tempting fate.

04:36.377 --> 04:38.277
I cannot say what
consequences

04:38.279 --> 04:40.045
Will befall you.

04:40.047 --> 04:43.215
The consequences of inaction
weigh far greater with me, sir.

04:43.217 --> 04:45.083
Henry.

04:45.085 --> 04:48.787
Under the circumstances,
"henry" will be fine.

04:49.989 --> 04:51.957
This will frighten you.

04:51.959 --> 04:54.259
Once I begin,
you must not stop me,

04:54.261 --> 04:55.827
No matter how much you want to.

04:55.829 --> 04:56.995
If you have any doubt,

04:56.997 --> 04:59.231
Now would be a good time
to make your exit.

05:00.566 --> 05:03.068
Thanks for the warning.
We're not going anywhere.

05:05.071 --> 05:06.238
Come.

05:06.240 --> 05:07.706
Come.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.909
Think of your wife.

05:10.911 --> 05:14.246
Summon her with all your heart.

05:14.248 --> 05:18.450
What I'm about to do
will bring you closer to her...

05:18.452 --> 05:20.485
And closer to death.

05:22.455 --> 05:23.855
I'm ready.

05:26.826 --> 05:28.060
(gasps)
henry!

05:30.163 --> 05:31.163
I told you:

05:31.165 --> 05:33.632
The closer he is to death,

05:33.634 --> 05:36.768
The shorter distance
he is to travel.

05:58.825 --> 06:00.726
(match strikes)

06:04.530 --> 06:06.098
Katrina?

06:13.206 --> 06:16.875
No, no, no, no.
How are you here?

06:16.877 --> 06:18.744
The sin eater.

06:18.746 --> 06:20.545
Moloch is always near.

06:20.547 --> 06:22.814
If he learns of
your presence...

06:22.816 --> 06:24.583
Is it true we have a son?

06:28.154 --> 06:30.922
I would have told you
when you first awoke,

06:30.924 --> 06:33.091
But we've had
fleeting moments

06:33.093 --> 06:35.026
Of precious time.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.928
We made a covenant
when we married.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.964
You owe me the truth.

06:41.601 --> 06:43.268
His name.

06:43.270 --> 06:46.204
Jeremy.

06:46.206 --> 06:49.608
Our son's name
was jeremy.

06:51.944 --> 06:55.447
After your grandfather.

06:55.449 --> 06:59.117
I did not know I was with child
when I buried you in that cave.

06:59.119 --> 07:01.420
Fortunately,
neither did my coven.

07:01.422 --> 07:04.289
They sought to punish me
for saving your life.

07:04.291 --> 07:06.057
<i>It was only when I fled</i>

07:06.059 --> 07:08.093
<i>To europe in search of a spell</i>

07:08.095 --> 07:11.062
To unbind you from the horseman
that I learned of my condition.

07:11.064 --> 07:15.634
<i>When my quest failed,</i>
<i>I returned home</i>

07:15.636 --> 07:17.536
<i>To my coven's</i>
<i>relentless pursuit.</i>

07:18.905 --> 07:22.040
<i>If I did not reveal</i>
<i>where I buried you,</i>

07:22.042 --> 07:24.042
<i>They would condemn me</i>
<i>to a fate worse than death.</i>

07:27.880 --> 07:30.315
<i>I knew then</i>
<i>they would not stop until</i>

07:30.317 --> 07:32.017
<i>They had us both, so I fled...</i>

07:34.086 --> 07:35.754
<i>...To the only sanctuary</i>
<i>I knew:</i>

07:35.756 --> 07:38.156
<i>Fredericks manor.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

07:38.158 --> 07:40.725
<i>I delivered our son under</i>
<i>lachlan and grace's care.</i>
<i>Hurry. Get her inside.</i>

07:40.727 --> 07:42.894
Grace: <i>Push!</i>
<i>(baby crying)</i>

07:42.896 --> 07:45.931
Mrs. Crane, it's a boy.

07:45.933 --> 07:48.934
<i>He was the most beautiful</i>
<i>creature I had ever seen.</i>

07:48.936 --> 07:51.470
<i>He had your eyes.</i>

07:51.472 --> 07:53.605
But I couldn't keep him.

07:53.607 --> 07:56.508
Not whilst your coven
was bent on revenge.

07:58.077 --> 07:59.444
That would have
endangered his life as well.

07:59.446 --> 08:02.781
I could not condemn our son
to a life as a fugitive.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.115
To protect him,

08:04.117 --> 08:07.018
In order to give him
a brighter future, I...

08:07.020 --> 08:09.321
I had to let him go.

08:09.323 --> 08:14.125
One day we'll see each other
again, little lord.

08:14.127 --> 08:18.330
And I will hold you in my dreams
every night until then.

08:18.332 --> 08:21.933
You are my heart and soul,
jeremy crane.

08:21.935 --> 08:24.603
And always will be.

08:24.605 --> 08:25.904
I made you a little friend.

08:26.939 --> 08:29.307
(baby coos)

08:29.309 --> 08:32.677
He will watch over you
while I'm away.

08:32.679 --> 08:36.114
He will make sure
that you are safe...

08:36.116 --> 08:39.084
And that you are never,
ever alone.

08:43.122 --> 08:44.890
(baby coos)

08:45.825 --> 08:47.659
<i>I left him in the care</i>

08:47.661 --> 08:49.461
<i>Of grace</i>
<i>and her husband joseph,</i>

08:49.463 --> 08:51.029
<i>A pastor at trinity church.</i>

08:51.031 --> 08:53.064
(baby fussing)

08:54.567 --> 08:56.601
(katrina sobbing)

09:00.806 --> 09:03.074
And that was the last time
I laid eyes

09:03.076 --> 09:04.843
On our son.

09:04.845 --> 09:08.580
This is an echo
of that place,

09:08.582 --> 09:12.751
Purgatory's cruel way of
confronting me with my choice...

09:12.753 --> 09:14.219
Until I am freed.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.254
So I come here
once a day

09:16.256 --> 09:17.589
And I light a candle

09:17.591 --> 09:20.025
In memoriam,
and I pray for his soul.

09:20.027 --> 09:24.229
Your own coven
banished you here?

09:24.231 --> 09:26.932
I was put here by sisters
with great power,

09:26.934 --> 09:29.334
Known as
"the four who speak as one."

09:29.336 --> 09:31.870
I am so sorry, my love,

09:31.872 --> 09:34.072
But I had no choice
but to give him up

09:34.074 --> 09:35.373
In order to save him.

09:35.375 --> 09:38.510
I will find out what happened
to our son.

09:38.512 --> 09:40.912
I will free you from this hell.

09:40.914 --> 09:45.083
We will defeat moloch
and we will be together again.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.751
I swear.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.357
(loud bang)

09:53.359 --> 09:54.726
You must leave.
Release your will

09:54.728 --> 09:56.795
To be here and you will
return to your realm.

09:56.797 --> 09:59.097
Do it now! Go!

10:00.700 --> 10:02.400
(gasps)

10:02.402 --> 10:03.969
Crane?

10:03.971 --> 10:04.970
Crane?!

10:04.972 --> 10:06.237
He'll be all right.

10:06.239 --> 10:09.374
His... His body is experiencing
a physical reaction.

10:11.944 --> 10:12.978
You strangled me.

10:14.714 --> 10:16.014
He means "thank you."

10:18.718 --> 10:20.952
Your ancestor grace...

10:20.954 --> 10:23.421
She took custody of my child.

10:23.423 --> 10:27.058
It seems your fates were merged
before you met.

10:27.060 --> 10:30.328
And the fate of my son
remains a mystery.

10:30.330 --> 10:31.930
We'll do everything
we can to find out

10:31.932 --> 10:34.032
What happened to him, crane.

10:35.167 --> 10:36.901
I promise.

11:31.058 --> 11:33.058
<i>Of your descendants</i>
<i>are still alive.</i>

11:33.060 --> 11:35.326
Well, if jeremy married

11:35.328 --> 11:36.861
And had three children,

11:36.863 --> 11:38.129
The average at the time,

11:38.131 --> 11:42.300
Then we compound that number
over eight generations...

11:42.302 --> 11:47.138
I could have as many as...

11:47.140 --> 11:49.674
6,000 offspring.

11:49.676 --> 11:51.743
6,000 little ichabods.

11:51.745 --> 11:53.478
I have an idea.

11:53.480 --> 11:56.915
The historical society library.

11:56.917 --> 11:59.718
They have a rare records
collection dating back

11:59.720 --> 12:02.387
To revolutionary-era
sleepy hollow.

12:02.389 --> 12:03.688
That's where we start.

12:03.690 --> 12:04.889
Parrish:
Officer mills!

12:04.891 --> 12:07.025
My train leaves in 18 minutes.

12:07.027 --> 12:09.094
We're five
minutes away.

12:09.096 --> 12:10.328
You'll be all right.

12:10.330 --> 12:13.298
Well, if it's all the same,
I'd rather not presume.

12:15.835 --> 12:17.368
Mr. Parrish--

12:17.370 --> 12:18.336
Henry--

12:18.338 --> 12:21.106
I beg you
a further request.

12:21.108 --> 12:23.608
Please, mr. Crane.

12:23.610 --> 12:27.345
The 8:05 p.M. Train, seat 15b.

12:27.347 --> 12:29.547
I do my crosswords,
they settle me.

12:29.549 --> 12:31.282
You saved my life.

12:31.284 --> 12:33.351
You granted me
passage to katrina.

12:34.754 --> 12:37.355
You have a purpose
with us.
My purpose

12:37.357 --> 12:38.890
Was to separate you
from the horseman

12:38.892 --> 12:41.059
So that you could continue

12:41.061 --> 12:44.062
The work for which
you have been called.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.597
Both of you.
And that is where

12:45.599 --> 12:47.599
My contribution ends.

12:47.601 --> 12:48.800
Abbie:
Henry.

12:48.802 --> 12:51.136
You know...

12:51.138 --> 12:54.072
When I found your file
the first time,

12:54.074 --> 12:57.308
Your mother, she died
when you were young.

12:57.310 --> 13:00.145
Cancer.

13:00.147 --> 13:02.313
Such a perfect
word for it.

13:02.315 --> 13:03.615
Your father

13:03.617 --> 13:06.217
Has been in a nursing home
the last ten years.

13:06.219 --> 13:07.986
Alzheimer's,
I think it is.

13:07.988 --> 13:10.054
You have
no other family?

13:10.056 --> 13:12.390
We're pretty thin
on it ourselves.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.759
If we don't find out more

13:14.761 --> 13:16.995
About the little
that we did have--

13:16.997 --> 13:19.597
Crane's son
and how we're all connected--

13:19.599 --> 13:21.399
We may not be
able to do

13:21.401 --> 13:23.101
The work that we have
been called to do.

13:23.103 --> 13:24.068
And then all your
incredible help

13:24.070 --> 13:26.070
Will be for nothing.

13:31.610 --> 13:33.611
There's a train

13:33.613 --> 13:37.982
That leaves at 12:44 a.M.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.819
Give me your word I'll be on it.

13:40.821 --> 13:42.887
You have my word.

13:44.924 --> 13:46.991
(car door closes)

13:58.671 --> 14:00.772
(growling)

14:06.512 --> 14:08.947
(growls)

14:08.949 --> 14:11.883
Man:
<i>Frank, what brings you</i>
<i>back to the church?</i>

14:11.885 --> 14:15.019
I remember a sermon
you gave once...

14:15.021 --> 14:16.354
About the two witnesses,

14:16.356 --> 14:18.456
Prophets of the apocalypse.
Mm-hmm.

14:18.458 --> 14:19.557
"two olive trees

14:19.559 --> 14:21.960
Who stand before
the lord of the earth."

14:21.962 --> 14:24.362
Symbolism, allegory...

14:24.364 --> 14:25.396
Literal?

14:25.398 --> 14:26.698
You could ask
those questions

14:26.700 --> 14:28.066
About all
the scriptures.

14:28.068 --> 14:29.968
Some people believe
they're absolute truths,

14:29.970 --> 14:32.070
Others see them
as parables.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.972
What happens to the witnesses?

14:33.974 --> 14:36.040
According to the new
testament, "witness"

14:36.042 --> 14:37.809
Means "martyr."

14:37.811 --> 14:39.277
They're destined to die
for their testimonies.

14:41.413 --> 14:43.047
What happens to the people
that follow them?

14:43.049 --> 14:46.317
Apostles usually suffer
the same fate as the martyr.

14:46.319 --> 14:50.121
You know I joined the service
because I wanted to help people?

14:53.692 --> 14:55.760
Then my little girl
got hit by a car.

14:59.164 --> 15:00.565
When I joined the force,

15:00.567 --> 15:02.767
I was gone so often
my wife left me.

15:05.237 --> 15:08.072
And now you're telling me

15:08.074 --> 15:10.675
That the grand prize
for a life of public service

15:10.677 --> 15:12.777
Might be death.

15:12.779 --> 15:15.113
You have to have faith
in the lord's plan, frank.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.248
He always
has a plan.
(laughs)

15:18.183 --> 15:20.551
Oh...

15:20.553 --> 15:23.154
If god has a plan, who's it for?

15:24.890 --> 15:26.958
Me or him?

15:31.463 --> 15:32.597
Frank...

15:32.599 --> 15:34.065
What aren't you
telling me?

15:34.067 --> 15:35.266
What's happening to you, frank?

15:35.268 --> 15:37.435
I remember why
I stopped coming here.

15:40.639 --> 15:42.807
Woman:
<i>From the 18th century?</i>

15:42.809 --> 15:44.042
<i>No.</i>

15:44.044 --> 15:45.476
I don't think
we have any records

15:45.478 --> 15:46.878
On trinity church.

15:46.880 --> 15:50.148
Madam, this town has existed
since adriaen van der donck

15:50.150 --> 15:53.051
Dubbed it
"sleeper's haven" in 1655.

15:53.053 --> 15:55.386
Surely there must
be some reference

15:55.388 --> 15:56.788
To its many
houses of worship

15:56.790 --> 15:59.057
In the town's
historical society.

15:59.059 --> 16:00.992
You speak with such
authority on the past.

16:00.994 --> 16:02.460
Without books,

16:02.462 --> 16:05.263
We have neither
a past nor a future.

16:05.265 --> 16:06.931
I would've thought
a librarian above all

16:06.933 --> 16:08.466
Would comprehend that.

16:12.071 --> 16:14.806
If we have anything
on trinity church,

16:14.808 --> 16:17.008
It would be in that
section over there.

16:17.010 --> 16:18.576
Feel free to look.

16:19.945 --> 16:22.046
I'll be
in the back.

16:31.290 --> 16:32.523
Mistletoe.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.525
That, you recognize.

16:36.862 --> 16:38.096
An enduring tradition,

16:38.098 --> 16:42.000
To the imminent peril
of all the pretty housemaids.

16:44.103 --> 16:45.403
Let's get to work.

16:46.538 --> 16:48.606
Parrish:
I found it.

16:49.875 --> 16:52.010
Grace martha dixon.

16:52.012 --> 16:55.513
Born 1751...

16:55.515 --> 16:57.515
Died 1784.

16:57.517 --> 16:58.883
She was a young woman.

16:58.885 --> 17:01.019
It says here, according
to eyewitness accounts,

17:01.021 --> 17:03.021
There was a fire.

17:03.023 --> 17:04.055
They were trapped inside.

17:04.057 --> 17:06.290
The local
townspeople

17:06.292 --> 17:07.358
Were afraid of jeremy.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.193
People claimed
they had seen him

17:09.195 --> 17:10.995
Start fires...

17:10.997 --> 17:11.963
Just by crying.

17:11.965 --> 17:14.365
(crying)

17:14.367 --> 17:15.900
Katrina's powers...

17:15.902 --> 17:17.535
He inherited them.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.003
After the house
burned down,

17:19.005 --> 17:20.738
They found the boy
the next morning,

17:20.740 --> 17:22.407
Completely unhurt.

17:22.409 --> 17:23.875
People came to believe

17:23.877 --> 17:25.410
He was some kind
of monster.

17:25.412 --> 17:27.345
After that, he was
sent to a home

17:27.347 --> 17:29.414
For orphan children
of the war.

17:30.349 --> 17:31.983
What happened to my child?

17:31.985 --> 17:33.818
It doesn't say.

17:35.154 --> 17:37.088
My son...

17:37.090 --> 17:40.024
Was responsible for
the death of your ancestors.

17:40.026 --> 17:41.893
It's not your fault.

17:41.895 --> 17:43.361
There's nothing
you could've done.

17:43.363 --> 17:44.562
I could've been there.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.064
Parrish:
That is a not a choice

17:46.066 --> 17:48.166
You were given, my friend.

17:49.668 --> 17:51.369
I'm so sorry.

17:51.371 --> 17:53.104
To both of you.

17:53.106 --> 17:56.407
I feared opening
these doors would be painful.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.910
The home to which
my son was sent...

17:58.912 --> 18:00.111
Does it have a name?

18:00.113 --> 18:01.212
Abbie:
There's nothing here.

18:01.214 --> 18:02.580
And don't count on miss helpful

18:02.582 --> 18:04.115
Guiding us in
the right direction.

18:04.117 --> 18:05.583
Oh...

18:05.585 --> 18:07.351
She knows more
than she's telling.

18:09.354 --> 18:11.422
Lying is a sin.

18:12.558 --> 18:15.760
I can sense a sin a mile away.

18:21.533 --> 18:22.733
She's gone.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.235
(car lock beeps)

18:24.237 --> 18:25.369
(car door shuts)

18:25.371 --> 18:26.471
Outside.

18:29.308 --> 18:30.975
(screams)

18:30.977 --> 18:33.111
(librarian screaming,
metal crunching)

18:39.885 --> 18:41.219
God...

18:41.221 --> 18:43.121
What could've
done this?

18:43.123 --> 18:46.357
I won't be catching
that later train, will I?

18:52.498 --> 18:54.098
Cynthia:
<i>Macey, your dad is here.</i>

18:54.100 --> 18:56.167
Macey:
Okay, mom.
In a minute.

18:56.169 --> 18:57.735
So how's life in the small city?

18:57.737 --> 18:59.103
Big city was quieter.

18:59.105 --> 19:02.006
Whenever you were here,
you wanted to go.

19:02.008 --> 19:04.275
Whenever you were gone,
you wished that

19:04.277 --> 19:05.877
You were here.

19:09.681 --> 19:10.781
Cynthia...

19:10.783 --> 19:12.283
I know that I made
it hard on you.

19:12.285 --> 19:13.951
Always being gone.

19:13.953 --> 19:16.320
I just want
you to know...

19:16.322 --> 19:17.288
(sighs)

19:17.290 --> 19:19.524
I'm sorry.

19:19.526 --> 19:21.559
You deserve better.

19:25.864 --> 19:29.000
You know, if you would've
told me that a year ago...

19:29.002 --> 19:31.602
You would still be living
in this house.

19:31.604 --> 19:34.105
I do now.

19:35.707 --> 19:36.774
Popski!

19:36.776 --> 19:38.943
Little bean!

19:38.945 --> 19:41.012
(chuckles)

19:43.615 --> 19:44.649
Bye, mama.

19:44.651 --> 19:46.050
Bye-bye, honey.

19:46.052 --> 19:47.318
You have fun, okay?

19:47.320 --> 19:48.986
Okay.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.688
Bye.

19:53.892 --> 19:57.395
The librarian's personal effects
just came in from impound.

19:58.664 --> 20:00.965
These are all of the
archivist's possessions?

20:02.067 --> 20:04.302
Just from her office at work.

20:04.304 --> 20:06.070
Apparently, she has
a personal safe.

20:06.072 --> 20:07.972
You doing crosswords?
As I said,

20:07.974 --> 20:09.707
It distracts me
from my troubles.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.642
A good puzzle

20:11.644 --> 20:12.577
Misleads you.

20:12.579 --> 20:14.045
It sends you in one direction,

20:14.047 --> 20:16.514
Fools you into thinking
you know what's going on.

20:16.516 --> 20:20.017
But once you've
discovered the trick,

20:20.019 --> 20:22.553
You see that there's often
a hidden meaning.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.755
Just as the librarian
was trying to conceal

20:24.757 --> 20:26.324
Something
from us.

20:26.326 --> 20:27.925
You don't,
perhaps,

20:27.927 --> 20:30.061
Know an unusual word for

20:30.063 --> 20:31.562
"fidgety and restless,"
do you?

20:31.564 --> 20:32.797
Gumplefik.

20:33.899 --> 20:34.932
Gumplefik?

20:34.934 --> 20:36.400
A perfect fit.

20:36.402 --> 20:37.902
I'm still reconciling

20:37.904 --> 20:39.537
Today's language
and its advancements.

20:39.539 --> 20:41.005
For example,
in my era,

20:41.007 --> 20:42.940
A "toilet" was
a vanity cabinet,

20:42.942 --> 20:46.344
"intercourse" was simply
"social conversation,"

20:46.346 --> 20:49.013
"awful" meant
"awe-inspiring"...

20:49.015 --> 20:51.949
So if I went out with a guy
and we had "awful intercourse,"

20:51.951 --> 20:53.284
We'd be going on a second date?

20:53.286 --> 20:56.020
Disconcerting, yet accurate.

20:56.022 --> 20:57.154
That's just weird.

20:59.057 --> 21:00.558
(grunts)

21:00.560 --> 21:01.592
What's wrong?

21:01.594 --> 21:03.461
The box...

21:04.263 --> 21:06.030
...It's filled with pain.

21:07.065 --> 21:09.066
Crane:
This symbol...

21:09.068 --> 21:12.203
<i>It's the crest</i>
<i>of katrina's coven,</i>

21:12.205 --> 21:13.971
The sisterhood of

21:13.973 --> 21:15.039
The radiant heart.

21:15.041 --> 21:16.207
Only a member
of the sisterhood

21:16.209 --> 21:17.942
Would possess such an item.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.410
Seriously?

21:19.412 --> 21:22.647
The librarian from the
historical society was a witch?

21:22.649 --> 21:25.049
Just as reverend knapp
was before her,

21:25.051 --> 21:28.052
Embedded in sleepy hollow
for centuries.

21:28.054 --> 21:30.254
It explains her expression:

21:30.256 --> 21:31.789
Recognition.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.224
She knew who you were.

21:35.260 --> 21:36.994
(chokes)

21:36.996 --> 21:38.062
Parrish:
Whatever is in there,

21:38.064 --> 21:40.631
It reeks

21:40.633 --> 21:42.166
Of anger

21:42.168 --> 21:44.335
And pain
and death.

21:44.337 --> 21:46.070
It's stronger than anything

21:46.072 --> 21:47.371
I've felt
in years.

21:49.007 --> 21:51.842
He will make sure
that you are safe.

21:55.180 --> 21:57.248
This drawing...

21:59.785 --> 22:02.453
...It's familiar.

22:02.455 --> 22:04.422
I've seen this doll.

22:04.424 --> 22:06.991
<i>When katrina came to me</i>
<i>in the dream or the vision</i>

22:06.993 --> 22:08.259
<i>Or whatever it was,</i>

22:08.261 --> 22:09.460
There was a
baby carriage.

22:09.462 --> 22:11.962
The doll was in it.

22:11.964 --> 22:13.364
May I see it, please?

22:17.602 --> 22:19.370
(parrish groans)

22:23.342 --> 22:26.110
The pain,

22:26.112 --> 22:28.112
The misery inside that box...

22:28.980 --> 22:30.881
I think it's your son's.

22:33.985 --> 22:36.153
The priest who governed
the orphanage...

22:36.155 --> 22:39.757
I can feel the darkness
of his heart.

22:41.460 --> 22:42.693
No food until penance.

22:42.695 --> 22:44.028
Parrish:
<i>The priest believed</i>

22:44.030 --> 22:45.830
<i>There was only one way</i>

22:45.832 --> 22:47.365
<i>Of purging</i>
<i>the boy's affliction.</i>

22:47.367 --> 22:50.067
<i>Until one day,</i>

22:50.069 --> 22:54.305
The child's pain
swelled in him so deeply,

22:54.307 --> 22:57.074
<i>He summoned the promise</i>
<i>of his mother's wish.</i>

22:57.076 --> 22:58.876
<i>And with a single drop</i>
<i>of blood,</i>

22:58.878 --> 23:03.047
<i>Discovered the true strength</i>
<i>of his power.</i>

23:18.163 --> 23:19.964
(bones crack)

23:38.683 --> 23:42.186
Jeremy...
Manifested his rage,

23:42.188 --> 23:43.754
His grief,

23:43.756 --> 23:46.791
In the absence of someone
to protect him.

23:46.793 --> 23:50.628
He made real a champion
to keep him safe.

23:50.630 --> 23:53.130
This violence we've seen,

23:53.132 --> 23:55.099
I believe it's the handiwork
of this champion.

23:55.101 --> 23:56.033
You don't know that.

23:56.035 --> 23:57.601
I've seen
this creature before

23:57.603 --> 23:59.103
In katrina's purgatory.

23:59.105 --> 24:01.205
(roars)

24:01.207 --> 24:04.208
When I returned
to the cabin, I...

24:04.210 --> 24:05.810
I could still feel

24:05.812 --> 24:07.211
Its presence.

24:07.213 --> 24:09.079
It followed me back.

24:09.081 --> 24:12.483
I was afraid something like this
would happen.

24:12.485 --> 24:15.653
I warned you not to tempt fate.

24:15.655 --> 24:17.154
Abbie:
Even if you're right,

24:17.156 --> 24:18.656
Why would it kill this witch?

24:18.658 --> 24:21.992
She was a member of the coven
that banished katrina...

24:21.994 --> 24:24.595
That robbed the boy
of his mother.

24:24.597 --> 24:26.163
There are more
in the coven,

24:26.165 --> 24:28.232
More who may still be alive.

24:29.634 --> 24:32.636
This death, I fear,

24:32.638 --> 24:35.539
May be the first
of many more to come.

24:40.946 --> 24:43.013
Irving:
It's called a "vine,"

24:43.015 --> 24:45.850
But it has absolutely nothing
to do with shrubbery?

24:45.852 --> 24:48.118
Macey:
Yeah, it's a video,
eight seconds long.

24:48.120 --> 24:49.620
On youtube?

24:49.622 --> 24:52.022
No, youtube videos are,
like, three minutes long.

24:52.024 --> 24:53.357
No one has time
for that.

24:53.359 --> 24:55.926
Yeah, I'm having a dad moment.
Thanks.

24:55.928 --> 24:57.928
(both laugh)

25:05.203 --> 25:08.973
You know, when we looked into
that wheelchair sports camp

25:08.975 --> 25:10.608
At the y last year,
we never followed up.

25:10.610 --> 25:11.775
I can give 'em a call.

25:11.777 --> 25:15.346
Dad, you get this sound
in your voice,

25:15.348 --> 25:18.983
It makes me feel
kind of helpless.

25:18.985 --> 25:21.051
I'm sorry.

25:21.053 --> 25:23.854
I mean, no matter
how scary it gets,

25:23.856 --> 25:26.290
I'm not gonna let this thing
beat me, right?

25:26.292 --> 25:28.526
I'm gonna keep fighting.
Remember you said that?

25:28.528 --> 25:31.128
Yeah, that I did.

25:31.130 --> 25:34.899
And I think it'd be
easier to fight it

25:34.901 --> 25:38.869
If I had some hot chocolate
with lots of marshmallows.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.237
Oh, understandable.

25:40.239 --> 25:43.040
(both chuckle)

25:43.042 --> 25:45.576
Oh, my god! Popski...

25:45.578 --> 25:48.879
You can have a hot chocolate,
not a puppy.

25:49.981 --> 25:52.816
Give me two hot chocolates
with peppermint.

25:52.818 --> 25:55.085
She seems like a strong kid.

25:55.087 --> 25:56.053
She is.

25:56.055 --> 25:57.254
How strong is she?

25:57.256 --> 25:58.389
Sorry?

25:58.391 --> 26:01.425
I said, how strong
is your daughter?

26:02.827 --> 26:05.496
Is she strong enough
to fight for her soul?

26:05.498 --> 26:07.598
What did you say to me?

26:07.600 --> 26:09.934
God may have a plan, captain,

26:09.936 --> 26:11.402
But we have one, too.

26:11.404 --> 26:13.270
Who the hell are you?!

26:14.205 --> 26:16.040
How did you know
what I said?!

26:16.042 --> 26:17.374
What the hell
are you talking about?

26:17.376 --> 26:19.376
How did you know
what I said?

26:19.378 --> 26:20.611
I don't know! I'm sorry!

26:20.613 --> 26:21.745
I don't know who the
hell you are, man.

26:21.747 --> 26:23.213
Hey! What's going on here?

26:23.215 --> 26:24.915
This guy just attacked me.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.050
Step back, sir.

26:26.052 --> 26:27.585
I'm new york state police.

26:27.587 --> 26:29.954
I'm reaching for my badge.

26:34.092 --> 26:35.993
Sorry.

26:38.363 --> 26:39.863
What's wrong with you?

26:39.865 --> 26:40.998
Let's go.

26:47.772 --> 26:49.873
We have one, too.

26:51.409 --> 26:53.477
Parrish:
The contents of the
librarian's safe have arrived.

26:53.479 --> 26:55.646
Anything of use?

26:55.648 --> 26:57.948
All the lieutenant's found
so far are ticket stubs

26:57.950 --> 27:02.620
From traveling carnivals over
the last hundred years.

27:02.622 --> 27:03.754
Strange.

27:03.756 --> 27:05.022
Mm.

27:09.160 --> 27:10.661
You're troubled.

27:13.164 --> 27:17.601
My father always
used to say to me,

27:17.603 --> 27:20.237
"when you have a child,

27:20.239 --> 27:24.808
He will follow your example
more than your advice."

27:25.777 --> 27:29.513
Yet my son had
the benefit of neither.

27:29.515 --> 27:34.284
I know that the choice
was not mine...

27:34.286 --> 27:38.789
But it brought his rage
into the world...

27:38.791 --> 27:40.991
Then and now.

27:43.128 --> 27:47.164
It is a father's task
to impart wisdom.

27:49.134 --> 27:51.902
Mine taught me
not to fear my power.

27:53.838 --> 27:57.941
I wished I could have
thanked him for this gift

27:57.943 --> 28:00.177
While his mind was still intact.

28:00.179 --> 28:02.680
Whatever became
of your son,

28:02.682 --> 28:06.350
You speak for him now.

28:07.318 --> 28:08.819
I believe he was

28:08.821 --> 28:11.121
A good man, ichabod.

28:11.123 --> 28:15.859
He was, after all,
molded from your clay.

28:20.732 --> 28:22.199
Washington's bible...

28:22.201 --> 28:23.801
Molded from clay.

28:24.569 --> 28:25.736
Katrina buried this with me.

28:25.738 --> 28:27.805
She said
it would provide answers

28:27.807 --> 28:30.074
For the challenges
which lay ahead.

28:31.543 --> 28:36.046
Here: Psalms 139,
"and your eyes did see

28:36.048 --> 28:38.148
My substance being
yet unformed."

28:38.150 --> 28:39.983
A reference in both

28:39.985 --> 28:41.985
The bible
and the judaic talmud

28:41.987 --> 28:43.320
To an enchanted being

28:43.322 --> 28:45.089
Made animate from
inanimate matter.

28:45.091 --> 28:49.259
Like the first son of god,
born of mud.

28:50.995 --> 28:52.162
A golem.

28:53.164 --> 28:54.998
I remember it
from Sunday school.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.501
It's like a magical attack dog.

28:57.503 --> 28:59.570
Forceful enough to crush
miss hudson's vehicle

28:59.572 --> 29:02.272
Using merely its fists.

29:02.274 --> 29:06.844
A creature imbued with its
creator's most ardent passions.

29:06.846 --> 29:08.112
Jeremy's doll

29:08.114 --> 29:12.750
Of course, he created
a protector.

29:16.087 --> 29:17.421
Wait a minute.

29:17.423 --> 29:21.692
<i>These four veiled women,</i>
<i>I've seen them before.</i>

29:21.694 --> 29:25.629
When I saw katrina and the doll,
they were there, too.

29:25.631 --> 29:27.564
"the four who speak as one."

29:27.566 --> 29:30.067
Abbie:
The librarian must have visited
them at different carnivals:

29:30.069 --> 29:33.537
Philadelphia,
new orleans, chicago.

29:33.539 --> 29:36.473
These are the women who banished
katrina to purgatory.

29:36.475 --> 29:38.809
If the golem has been made real

29:38.811 --> 29:41.879
And seeks revenge against those
who hurt the boy...

29:41.881 --> 29:43.914
Then surely they'll be next.

29:43.916 --> 29:46.784
And if they put katrina
in purgatory...

29:46.786 --> 29:49.720
It stands to reason
they could bring her back.

29:49.722 --> 29:52.055
And it'd strike a powerful blow
against moloch.

29:52.057 --> 29:54.992
We must find them
before the golem does.

29:54.994 --> 29:57.728
The last ticket stub,
dated two days ago,

29:57.730 --> 30:00.664
A carnival in dobbs ferry,
right outside town.

30:00.666 --> 30:02.232
That's where they are.

30:12.243 --> 30:13.811
Wait here.

30:13.813 --> 30:15.479
You're not going in there alone.

30:15.481 --> 30:16.947
Crane:
These women
imprisoned my wife

30:16.949 --> 30:19.650
And left my son abandoned
without hope.

30:19.652 --> 30:22.653
I think I'm entitled
to a private word

30:22.655 --> 30:24.588
Before we take them to safety.

30:24.590 --> 30:26.089
It seems we've been relegated

30:26.091 --> 30:28.492
To the part of gongoozler,
you and I.

30:28.494 --> 30:30.093
I'm not even gonna ask.

30:30.095 --> 30:31.361
Crane:
Gongoozler means

30:31.363 --> 30:33.263
"idle spectator."

30:33.265 --> 30:35.132
Oh, great.
That's just great.

30:35.134 --> 30:36.934
You go. It's cool.

30:36.936 --> 30:38.602
Henry and I will
sit back here

30:38.604 --> 30:41.471
An gongoozle our asses off.

30:41.473 --> 30:43.373
Now who's the scrooge?

30:43.375 --> 30:46.510
Be careful, crane.

31:04.395 --> 31:06.063
Woman:
Who's there?

31:06.065 --> 31:08.732
As you so proudly boast
of your clairvoyance,

31:08.734 --> 31:12.069
Your query suggests you're lying
or merely playing coy.

31:12.071 --> 31:13.270
Show yourselves.

31:20.745 --> 31:22.412
Curious.

31:22.414 --> 31:23.847
Your aura, it's...

31:23.849 --> 31:26.049
Displaced,
fractured...

31:26.051 --> 31:27.017
Unreadable.

31:27.019 --> 31:28.018
Your palm,

31:28.020 --> 31:29.386
Bring it here.

31:39.397 --> 31:41.198
(gasps)

31:41.200 --> 31:43.934
Your lifeline was interrupted
long ago...

31:43.936 --> 31:44.902
Then revived.

31:44.904 --> 31:46.336
There is but one mortal...

31:46.338 --> 31:48.472
With such
a curious fate.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.945
You are ichabod crane.

31:54.947 --> 31:57.247
We've waited centuries
for this moment.

31:57.249 --> 31:58.916
It was foretold...

31:58.918 --> 32:02.185
That your arrival
would seal our fate.

32:02.187 --> 32:04.755
Seal your fate?

32:04.757 --> 32:06.590
I don't understand.

32:09.961 --> 32:11.628
You will.

32:11.630 --> 32:14.298
For tonight... We die.

32:25.209 --> 32:26.910
Crane:
If what you're
saying is true,

32:26.912 --> 32:28.111
I can take you
to safety,

32:28.113 --> 32:31.048
But only if you release katrina.

32:31.050 --> 32:32.983
If our destiny is to die...

32:32.985 --> 32:36.053
We must accept it,
whatever form it takes.

32:36.055 --> 32:37.254
Nothing you can offer...

32:37.256 --> 32:38.588
Will change that.

32:38.590 --> 32:42.125
Well, then here's some
clairvoyance for you:

32:42.127 --> 32:43.961
Death will come for you tonight

32:43.963 --> 32:46.563
In the form of a creature
known as a golem.

32:46.565 --> 32:48.432
Accept my offer,
or your demise

32:48.434 --> 32:51.501
Will be most painful indeed.

32:51.503 --> 32:52.936
The golem... Has returned?

32:52.938 --> 32:54.404
How?

32:54.406 --> 32:56.006
It followed me back
from purgatory.

32:56.008 --> 32:58.475
You found a way
between realms...

32:58.477 --> 33:01.244
And in so doing,
repeated your wife's mistake...

33:01.246 --> 33:03.280
By altering the ordained path.

33:03.282 --> 33:06.249
I don't believe fate befalls us
however we act.

33:06.251 --> 33:08.151
Only unless we act.

33:08.153 --> 33:09.987
Then you've learned nothing.

33:09.989 --> 33:11.922
Katrina defied fate as well.

33:11.924 --> 33:13.623
Your death would've spared her.

33:13.625 --> 33:14.992
And your child.

33:14.994 --> 33:16.593
Of all the pain they endured

33:16.595 --> 33:18.095
After you were laid to wait.

33:18.097 --> 33:19.930
It was not
your decision to make!

33:21.032 --> 33:24.835
A coven is meant
to be a source of good.

33:24.837 --> 33:27.037
Yet you delivered
my wife into captivity

33:27.039 --> 33:28.705
In the hands of the enemy.

33:28.707 --> 33:31.875
Necessity makes
strange bedfellows.

33:31.877 --> 33:33.610
And it was our sacred duty...

33:33.612 --> 33:36.013
To rectify
what katrina had undone.

33:36.015 --> 33:39.383
Rumors of jeremy's
fearsome companion spread.

33:39.385 --> 33:40.784
And so they were hunted.

33:40.786 --> 33:43.286
(men yelling)

33:43.288 --> 33:46.823
<i>The creature killed</i>
<i>in defense of his master.</i>

33:46.825 --> 33:48.358
<i>A mindless thing</i>
<i>that murdered anyone</i>

33:48.360 --> 33:51.728
<i>Who came close to the boy.</i>

33:51.730 --> 33:53.463
When we learned
who your son was,

33:53.465 --> 33:54.698
What he had created...

33:54.700 --> 33:55.866
We offered our help.

33:55.868 --> 33:58.869
But he refused beyond control.

33:58.871 --> 34:00.070
He chose to be alone.

34:00.072 --> 34:01.371
With his golem.

34:01.373 --> 34:04.007
He was afraid.

34:04.009 --> 34:06.009
The creature was
his only means of defense.

34:06.011 --> 34:08.011
That is why they both
had to be stopped.

34:08.013 --> 34:09.413
What did you do to him?

34:09.415 --> 34:11.581
The golem could not
be destroyed by our spells.

34:11.583 --> 34:14.184
So we imprisoned
the creature in purgatory.

34:14.186 --> 34:15.719
But your son was immune to us.

34:15.721 --> 34:17.587
His power had grown too great.

34:17.589 --> 34:19.156
We offered him a place

34:19.158 --> 34:21.358
In our coven.
But he again refused.

34:21.360 --> 34:22.993
With no other choice,

34:22.995 --> 34:24.828
<i>The sisterhood</i>
<i>bound together...</i>

34:24.830 --> 34:26.496
<i>And invoked a hex...</i>

34:26.498 --> 34:28.832
<i>To stop his heart.</i>

34:28.834 --> 34:31.168
(coven chanting)

34:38.509 --> 34:41.011
You murdered my son.

34:41.013 --> 34:42.913
Death begets death.

34:42.915 --> 34:44.548
That is the price we now pay.

34:44.550 --> 34:45.849
Our fate is sealed,

34:45.851 --> 34:48.118
Our time run out.

34:51.756 --> 34:54.758
How do I kill the golem?

34:54.760 --> 34:56.593
Your son's blood gave it life.

34:56.595 --> 34:59.029
Only his blood can end it.

34:59.031 --> 35:00.764
(lightning crashes)

35:00.766 --> 35:02.299
All:
Run!

35:06.137 --> 35:07.971
Crane!
The golem!

35:07.973 --> 35:10.974
(screaming nearby)

35:12.410 --> 35:15.078
Where are the sisters?

35:15.080 --> 35:16.847
(golem roaring, growling)

35:19.383 --> 35:21.284
They've met a just fate.

35:21.286 --> 35:23.420
Did they tell you
how to stop it?

35:23.422 --> 35:25.322
Only that my son's blood
gave it life,

35:25.324 --> 35:27.190
And only his blood can end it.

35:28.793 --> 35:30.627
I'm gonna get
these people out of here.

35:30.629 --> 35:31.728
(golem growls)

35:38.903 --> 35:40.871
This way.

35:44.008 --> 35:45.142
(gasps)

35:45.144 --> 35:47.744
What hellish form
of torment is this?

35:48.479 --> 35:49.980
Funhouse mirrors.

35:49.982 --> 35:52.149
When did irony
become a national pastime?

35:55.453 --> 35:57.521
(roaring)

36:02.326 --> 36:04.060
You're hurt.

36:06.664 --> 36:09.533
(groans)

36:12.303 --> 36:13.837
(grunts)

36:19.010 --> 36:20.110
You said...

36:20.112 --> 36:21.545
Blood...

36:21.547 --> 36:24.381
Gave the doll life.

36:24.383 --> 36:28.051
Your son's blood is your blood.

36:28.053 --> 36:30.387
Your blood can destroy it.

36:34.892 --> 36:35.992
(grunts)

36:35.994 --> 36:37.994
Crane?

36:37.996 --> 36:38.995
(abbie screams)

36:38.997 --> 36:40.864
Crane:
Stop!

36:45.870 --> 36:48.038
I'm jeremy's father.

36:49.340 --> 36:51.374
You exist because I did not.

36:51.376 --> 36:52.742
(growls)

36:52.744 --> 36:53.977
If there was any way

36:53.979 --> 36:56.346
I could go back and change this,
believe me,

36:56.348 --> 36:59.616
With all my heart, I would.

37:01.919 --> 37:04.187
But fate bestowed
this task on you.

37:04.189 --> 37:06.523
His only friend.

37:06.525 --> 37:09.559
His guardian.

37:09.561 --> 37:12.662
And in many ways,
a father to him.

37:12.664 --> 37:16.333
For that, I owe
you my life.

37:18.035 --> 37:20.704
But now I'm begging you to stop.

37:20.706 --> 37:23.006
(low growl)

37:23.008 --> 37:24.541
Jeremy is gone.

37:24.543 --> 37:27.077
There's nothing left
for you to protect.

37:27.079 --> 37:29.779
You have to let him go.

37:29.781 --> 37:32.983
We both have to let him go.

37:40.791 --> 37:44.027
(golem roars)
(crane grunting)

37:48.032 --> 37:50.667
(roars)

38:07.952 --> 38:10.020
You've endured enough pain.

38:11.889 --> 38:15.125
Bear it no more.

38:15.127 --> 38:17.827
My son.

38:19.163 --> 38:21.298
Be at peace.

38:23.134 --> 38:25.235
Be at peace.

38:40.651 --> 38:42.752
Ichabod.

38:43.988 --> 38:46.589
He's gone.

38:51.462 --> 38:53.897
It's over.

39:09.013 --> 39:10.647
I'm glad you're all right.

39:10.649 --> 39:11.848
And I'm...

39:11.850 --> 39:13.950
Sorry to make
a hasty exit.

39:13.952 --> 39:15.218
But...

39:15.220 --> 39:18.054
The next train leaves
in 18 minutes.

39:18.056 --> 39:19.989
Mr. Parrish...
Oh, please.

39:19.991 --> 39:22.525
It's henry, remember?

39:22.527 --> 39:24.794
And if I may, you were right.

39:24.796 --> 39:27.864
About?
I've been called to help you

39:27.866 --> 39:29.232
In your mission.

39:29.234 --> 39:31.901
If I hadn't separated your
blood from the horseman,

39:31.903 --> 39:34.771
You would not have been able
to put the golem to rest.

39:36.006 --> 39:37.640
Or your son.

39:41.245 --> 39:44.647
Thank you for availing me
of your gift.

39:46.083 --> 39:50.019
It seems no matter
how hard we both tried,

39:50.021 --> 39:52.389
One cannot turn from fate.

39:52.391 --> 39:53.990
(quietly):
No.

39:53.992 --> 39:57.060
And yet,
for the first time, I...

39:57.062 --> 40:00.463
I feel that fate
has delivered me a blessing.

40:02.500 --> 40:04.334
By bringing you both
into my life.

40:04.336 --> 40:06.403
It's our privilege, henry.

40:09.206 --> 40:12.375
We never bury the dead, son.

40:12.377 --> 40:14.444
Not really.

40:14.446 --> 40:16.513
We take them with us.

40:19.450 --> 40:22.118
It's the price of living.

40:31.462 --> 40:33.596
I got you something.

40:35.399 --> 40:36.766
Oh.

40:36.768 --> 40:38.935
♪ ah-ha, ha.

40:38.937 --> 40:42.405
I was gonna give it to you
on christmas eve, but...

40:42.407 --> 40:44.207
You look like you
need a little boost.

40:46.444 --> 40:49.078
Oh.

40:49.080 --> 40:51.648
(crane chuckles)

40:51.650 --> 40:53.049
You've em...

40:53.051 --> 40:56.586
You embroidered my name
on some oversized hosiery.

40:56.588 --> 40:58.288
How... Odd.

40:58.290 --> 41:00.723
It is a christmas tradition.

41:00.725 --> 41:02.225
Is it?

41:02.227 --> 41:05.395
Merry christmas, crane.

41:05.397 --> 41:08.465
Merry christmas, lieutenant.

41:12.169 --> 41:13.837
I'm starving.

41:13.839 --> 41:16.339
I'm gonna go get
some comfort food.

41:16.341 --> 41:18.475
I'll be back in ten.

41:23.514 --> 41:25.582
(dripping nearby)

41:46.937 --> 41:48.438
Reveal yourself!

41:48.440 --> 41:51.007
(woman murmuring nearby)

41:51.009 --> 41:52.876
Katrina?

41:52.878 --> 41:55.111
Moloch:
Not katrina!

41:55.113 --> 41:57.113
Come out and face me, moloch.

41:58.983 --> 42:01.351
Or are you afraid?

42:01.353 --> 42:05.054
Moloch:
I offer this warning.

42:05.056 --> 42:08.958
A saint's name is a sign.

42:08.960 --> 42:11.561
When you know my meaning,

42:11.563 --> 42:13.563
War will take form.

42:13.565 --> 42:16.499
And the end of days begins.

42:16.501 --> 42:19.168
There will be no end of days.

42:19.170 --> 42:20.703
You hear me?!

42:20.705 --> 42:22.972
Moloch:
Your death is assured.

42:22.974 --> 42:26.142
You and the second witness.

42:26.144 --> 42:28.945
Face me, coward!

42:32.349 --> 42:35.718
I touched her soul once.

42:35.720 --> 42:38.988
Soon it will be mine forever.

42:38.990 --> 42:41.991
And you will give it to me.

42:42.993 --> 42:45.061
(gasping)

42:51.268 --> 42:54.003
Crane?

42:54.005 --> 42:56.105
What happened?

42:56.107 --> 42:59.108
Moloch.

42:59.110 --> 43:02.011
He's coming for your soul.

43:03.914 --> 43:05.982
He says I will deliver it
to him.

43:10.454 --> 43:12.021
