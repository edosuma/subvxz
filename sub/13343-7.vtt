WEBVTT

00:06.607 --> 00:09.910
* Just a little boy lost
looking for a lamb *

00:10.010 --> 00:12.580
* In the all-night city

00:12.680 --> 00:18.018
* Living in
his lonely limousine *

00:18.119 --> 00:21.255
* And though
he never has to worry *

00:21.355 --> 00:24.258
* He's the only one
and only one *

00:24.358 --> 00:26.194
* He's ever gonna need

00:26.294 --> 00:29.663
* Absolutely,
he's in definite need *

00:29.763 --> 00:33.801
* Ooh, maybe we've been
alone too long *

00:33.901 --> 00:36.837
* You don't
want to be lonely *

00:36.937 --> 00:39.407
* Maybe we've been
alone too long *

00:39.507 --> 00:44.478
* You don't want
to be lonely. *

00:46.647 --> 00:50.451
Notice anything funny
about that license plate, hmm?

00:50.551 --> 00:51.985
It's a rental.

00:52.086 --> 00:56.190
But Maguire said that
he was driving his own
car that night.

00:56.290 --> 00:57.825
Huh.
( scoffs )

00:57.925 --> 00:59.293
Looks like
our retired pitcher

00:59.393 --> 01:01.329
was trying to throw us
a curveball.

01:01.429 --> 01:03.664
I'm sorry-- I'm sorry,
can I start over?

01:03.764 --> 01:05.099
- Sure.
- Okay.

01:05.199 --> 01:07.268
But that was really good.
Keep that energy.

01:08.869 --> 01:10.404
( vibrates lips )

01:14.242 --> 01:15.609
Could you roll
that security camera--

01:15.709 --> 01:16.944
nope, that's-- blah.

01:17.044 --> 01:18.646
I'm sorry.

01:18.746 --> 01:19.880
Did my voice sound weird?

01:19.980 --> 01:21.149
Am I doing, like,
a hollow thing?

01:21.249 --> 01:22.483
Your voice sounds fine.

01:22.583 --> 01:26.587
Okay, again. Again.
( exhales sharply )

01:29.290 --> 01:31.058
Can you roll
that security camera
footage again?

01:31.159 --> 01:33.794
Fuck!
I'm sorry, whoa.

01:33.894 --> 01:35.529
( groans )
I'm just--

01:35.629 --> 01:37.931
Sweetie, I think
you're getting
a little worked up.

01:38.031 --> 01:41.602
The reason we brought
you here is because we like
what you do, all right?

01:41.702 --> 01:44.572
So, why don't you go outside,
relax a little bit,

01:44.672 --> 01:47.040
come back in
when you're ready, okay?

01:47.141 --> 01:48.542
Okay.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.283
( exhales )

01:55.383 --> 01:58.719
That was quick.
Is everything okay?

01:58.819 --> 02:00.020
Oh, yeah.
I need a minute.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.655
I was getting
inside my head.

02:01.755 --> 02:05.326
You know what?
I know that there's
a little voice in there

02:05.426 --> 02:07.060
that's saying,
you know,

02:07.161 --> 02:08.996
"You're not good enough.
You're not pretty enough.

02:09.096 --> 02:10.531
You don't
even belong here."

02:10.631 --> 02:13.133
And, you know,
well, shut up.

02:13.234 --> 02:14.868
Okay, I'm sorry.
I need to focus.

02:14.968 --> 02:17.171
- Oh, yeah, okay.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

02:17.271 --> 02:19.340
( exhales )

02:25.012 --> 02:27.481
- Hey.
- Hello, mate.

02:28.616 --> 02:29.850
How you doing?

02:29.950 --> 02:31.185
Not great.

02:31.285 --> 02:33.321
I forget what
you're here for again.

02:33.421 --> 02:36.023
You said I could
borrow your cooler

02:36.123 --> 02:37.425
for the drive up
to this wedding.

02:37.525 --> 02:39.126
I spoke to the bride
and groom, right?

02:39.227 --> 02:40.328
They're gonna
put me on a table

02:40.428 --> 02:42.129
of beautiful
single ladies.

02:42.230 --> 02:44.398
Single ladies.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.234
Wonder if my wife
will be there.

02:46.334 --> 02:47.835
Oh, I wouldn't have
thought so, no.

02:47.935 --> 02:50.471
It's going to be actresses
and models, apparently.

02:50.571 --> 02:51.839
Yeah.

02:51.939 --> 02:53.106
No, you know what?

02:53.207 --> 02:55.042
You go have fun.
It's a wedding.

02:55.142 --> 02:56.710
Okay, but listen,
I'll be back tomorrow.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.279
I'll bring this
and we can have
a good sit-down

02:58.379 --> 02:59.780
and a good talk, yeah?

02:59.880 --> 03:01.382
- Thanks, buddy.
- Okay.

03:01.482 --> 03:02.950
- See you later, man.
- See ya.

03:03.050 --> 03:05.519
- ( chattering )
- ( music playing )

03:08.622 --> 03:10.724
Hey, have you
heard anything?

03:10.824 --> 03:13.594
It's, like, 3:00.
How long does it take them
to make these decisions?

03:13.694 --> 03:16.364
Danny promised we'd know
by the end of the day.

03:16.464 --> 03:18.799
Well, isn't there
a table read on Monday?

03:18.899 --> 03:20.734
- Glenn?
- Hmm?

03:20.834 --> 03:22.503
- 1:00.
- 1:00 what?

03:22.603 --> 03:24.338
Babe alert.

03:24.438 --> 03:26.106
Hold this, please.

03:26.206 --> 03:29.343
Excuse me while I go
and talk to the future
Mrs. Pritchard.

03:32.012 --> 03:34.948
- Hey, babe.
- Ah-- aye.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.586
- How'd it go?
- Just warming up.

03:38.686 --> 03:39.687
Hmm.

03:39.787 --> 03:41.154
Carrie said I was
gonna be on a table

03:41.255 --> 03:42.756
with a bunch of
single ladies, so...

03:42.856 --> 03:44.458
- ( phone beeps )
- Is that them?

03:44.558 --> 03:47.361
- Mm, not them.
- ( sighs )

03:47.461 --> 03:48.862
Honestly, if I
don't get this job,

03:48.962 --> 03:51.299
I'm gonna seriously
consider quitting acting.

03:51.399 --> 03:53.000
I can't keep jumping
through all these hoops

03:53.100 --> 03:54.368
if I'm not
getting anywhere.

03:54.468 --> 03:57.638
You are my lover
and my teacher.

03:57.738 --> 04:00.574
You are my mentor
and my model.

04:00.674 --> 04:04.044
Carrie:
You are my anchor
and my accomplice.

04:04.144 --> 04:05.413
Groom:
You are my true soul mate

04:05.513 --> 04:08.181
and my everlasting
counterpart.

04:08.282 --> 04:10.518
Both:
In sickness and in health,

04:10.618 --> 04:13.387
through dark times
and light,

04:13.487 --> 04:16.357
for the rest of the days
of my life.

04:16.457 --> 04:18.125
What table
are you on?

04:18.225 --> 04:19.560
Table eight.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.261
Well, have fun
'cause I'm at table 12

04:21.362 --> 04:22.663
and that's where
the party's at.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.598
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.367
See you later.

04:28.669 --> 04:30.404
Woman:
It's okay, baby.

04:30.504 --> 04:33.741
- Aw, honey
- ( baby crying )

04:33.841 --> 04:35.643
Little baby.

04:35.743 --> 04:38.546
- This is table 12, is it?
- Yes.

04:38.646 --> 04:41.281
- I think
there's been a mistake.
- Woman: Aw, it's okay.

04:41.382 --> 04:44.151
Aw, can we get
some juice?

04:44.251 --> 04:46.787
- Little baby.
- ( crying continues )

04:46.887 --> 04:48.722
Thank you
so much for coming.
I really appreciate it.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.458
Cousin Bob.

04:50.558 --> 04:52.860
- Oh, hey, Stuart.
- Hey, all right.
You look wonderful.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.462
- Thank you for coming.
- I have to say, you don't
scrub up too bad yourself.

04:54.562 --> 04:56.096
- Aren't you sweet?
- It's all her.

04:56.196 --> 04:58.265
Oh, yeah, fantastic.
Thank you for--
hang on a sec.

04:58.366 --> 04:59.967
Um, just one thing
that occurred to me.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.602
I don't know
if you remember,
but you told me

05:01.702 --> 05:03.537
I'd be on a table
with some single people

05:03.637 --> 05:06.106
and I seem to be on
a table with an older
group

05:06.206 --> 05:07.875
and a child and--

05:07.975 --> 05:09.577
I'm sorry about that.

05:09.677 --> 05:11.311
We had to fit
in more people than
we'd planned.

05:11.412 --> 05:12.513
But you are with
another English person,

05:12.613 --> 05:14.247
- so that should be fun.
- Yeah.

05:14.348 --> 05:16.016
- Hey, good to see you.
- All right.

05:16.116 --> 05:17.351
- How are you?
- Tom.

05:17.451 --> 05:18.586
- Thanks for coming.
- Mister and Missus.

05:18.686 --> 05:20.253
- And Janet.
- Great to see you.

05:20.354 --> 05:22.122
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Janet, you look beautiful.

05:22.222 --> 05:23.957
Great to see you.
Stuart, hi.

05:24.057 --> 05:25.893
Sorry, yeah,
I just, um---

05:25.993 --> 05:27.661
It was just
'cause you promised that
I would be on the table--

05:27.761 --> 05:29.630
Yeah, I'm sorry
about that,

05:29.730 --> 05:32.165
- but I'm sure
you understand.
- I don't, actually.

05:32.265 --> 05:34.267
But I'll tell you what.
You're clearly busy.
I can see that.

05:34.368 --> 05:36.470
Why don't I go in there
and just jiggle some
things around?

05:36.570 --> 05:39.106
You know, wherever
your name card is,
just sit there, okay?

05:39.206 --> 05:41.141
It's your special day.

05:41.241 --> 05:44.445
- Good to see you.
- Nice to see you.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.856
- Oh, hello, ladies.
- Hi.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.558
- Stuart: How's it going?
- Welcome to the loser table.

05:57.658 --> 05:59.727
Please, we're not
losers, all right?

05:59.827 --> 06:02.530
We're just people
who haven't found
the one yet, am I right?

06:02.630 --> 06:04.732
- Yes, true that.
- Yeah, absolutely.

06:04.832 --> 06:06.366
Excuse me.

06:06.467 --> 06:07.668
I think I'm supposed
to be at this table,

06:07.768 --> 06:09.369
but I don't see
my name anywhere.

06:09.470 --> 06:11.505
- What is your name?
- Luke.

06:11.605 --> 06:12.940
Has anyone got
a Luke on their card?

06:13.040 --> 06:14.775
- No.
- No?

06:14.875 --> 06:16.243
Doesn't seem to be
one here, mate.

06:16.343 --> 06:18.045
I'm supposed to be
at table four.

06:18.145 --> 06:19.780
I think there's been
a couple of mix-ups
today, actually.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.650
- Yeah, frustrating,
isn't it?
- Thanks.

06:22.750 --> 06:25.252
( sighs )
So, what do you do?

06:25.352 --> 06:26.820
I am an actress.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.689
Are you really?

06:28.789 --> 06:31.592
Glenn,
Nicole Mortimer's here.

06:33.126 --> 06:35.095
- Who?
- She's a playwright.

06:35.195 --> 06:37.264
Carrie was in
one of her plays.

06:37.364 --> 06:39.166
Glenn, she's brilliant.

06:39.266 --> 06:41.234
Maybe you should
talk to her. I'm sure
she'll be thrilled.

06:41.334 --> 06:44.137
No, I'm not doing that.
She probably gets approached
all the time.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.873
By who?
She's a playwright.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.308
I'm gonna introduce you.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.611
- No.
No, no, no, no, Glenn.
- Yeah.

06:52.179 --> 06:54.515
Ms. Mortimer?
I'm sure you get this
all the time.

06:54.615 --> 06:55.949
I am a giant fan
of your work,

06:56.049 --> 06:58.552
as is my client,
Jessica Vanderhoff.

06:58.652 --> 07:00.087
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

07:00.187 --> 07:01.855
Jessica is
a fabulous actress.

07:01.955 --> 07:05.258
She is on a short list
for a starring role
on "NCIS: L.A."

07:05.358 --> 07:06.827
Well, it's just
a stupid cop show.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.361
I probably
won't even get it.

07:08.462 --> 07:10.598
I'm actually moving
away from acting

07:10.698 --> 07:12.199
and focusing more
on my own writing.

07:12.299 --> 07:13.701
What are you
working on?

07:13.801 --> 07:16.336
I'm currently
finishing up
a web series

07:16.436 --> 07:18.539
about one woman's
descent into madness.

07:18.639 --> 07:20.307
Ah, what's it called?

07:20.407 --> 07:22.910
"Descent into Madness."

07:23.010 --> 07:24.812
Well, good luck with it.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.514
I'll check it out
when it's up.

07:26.614 --> 07:28.281
- Nice to meet you.
- Glenn: Nice meeting you.

07:28.381 --> 07:30.383
Thank you so much.

07:30.484 --> 07:32.753
See you
in the trenches.

07:34.755 --> 07:36.924
I'm not gonna
be indiscreet
on her wedding day,

07:37.024 --> 07:39.693
but let's just
say there were two
attractive people

07:39.793 --> 07:42.730
in a house
with a hot tub
and a swimming pool.

07:42.830 --> 07:44.765
- Hey, Stuart.
- There she is.
Talk of the devil.

07:44.865 --> 07:47.501
I think you may be
at the wrong table,
actually.

07:47.601 --> 07:49.637
- I don't think so.
- No, I think so.

07:49.737 --> 07:53.240
No, 'cause I'm pretty sure
you told me to sit wherever
my name card is.

07:53.340 --> 07:56.076
- Here's my name card.
- Yeah, because your table
number's on the inside.

07:56.176 --> 07:58.111
12.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.484
Someone should
get fired for this

08:04.585 --> 08:06.720
because you should not be
worrying about this shit
on your wedding day.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.255
Do you want me
to have a talk with
the wedding planner?

08:08.355 --> 08:09.623
'Cause I--
my blood's boiling.

08:09.723 --> 08:11.058
I can only imagine
how you're feeling.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.226
Stuart, I'd rather you
just sit at your table.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.229
- What are you doing?
- ( clanking )

08:16.329 --> 08:19.166
Never buy a bottle
of wine that says
"Napa Valley" on it.

08:19.266 --> 08:22.736
- People like you
still get conned...
- They do.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.706
...into shelling out
more for the Napa name.

08:25.806 --> 08:27.374
( clanking continues )

08:27.474 --> 08:29.677
- Man: One of the things--
- Woman: Listen, this is funny.

08:29.777 --> 08:31.411
Man:
One of the things
that I like to do...

08:31.511 --> 08:32.746
Listen.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.282
...is take a completely
shit bottle...

08:37.150 --> 08:39.252
Look what you've done,
you little monkey.

08:39.352 --> 08:42.590
What are you like?
What is he like?

08:44.257 --> 08:46.293
- Hello again.
- Oh, hi.

08:46.393 --> 08:48.762
Hi, I'm sorry
to interrupt.

08:48.862 --> 08:52.065
You said that you
would be willing to take
a look at my web series.

08:52.165 --> 08:56.103
Sure. I'll give
you my agent's address
and you can send it to me.

08:56.203 --> 08:59.006
Oh, well, I can actually
show you right now.
It's really short.

08:59.106 --> 09:00.407
Where would we watch it?

09:00.507 --> 09:02.776
Oh, technology.

09:05.245 --> 09:06.814
- ( boy pounding on table )
- Woman: The last trip we did--

09:06.914 --> 09:08.248
was that? Oh, God,
do you remember that?

09:08.348 --> 09:10.083
- Amsterdam, have you been?
- Man: Amsterdam.

09:10.183 --> 09:11.451
- Don't bother.
- No.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.053
What is he like, huh?

09:13.153 --> 09:15.723
What is he like?
What are you like,
little monkey?

09:15.823 --> 09:18.792
- ( laughing )
- Anyway, so, in Amsterdam...

09:18.892 --> 09:21.028
- ( pounding continues )
- ...we saw the canals.

09:21.128 --> 09:24.397
We went to that--
what's it, the house--
the diary girl?

09:24.497 --> 09:25.699
- Anne Frank.
- Anne Frank.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.267
It was disappointing,
wasn't it?

09:27.367 --> 09:29.336
- Yeah.
- It was disappointing?

09:29.436 --> 09:30.671
We were expecting
to be more moved

09:30.771 --> 09:32.139
'cause it's such
a tragic story,

09:32.239 --> 09:35.909
but it wasn't as small
as we were expecting.

09:36.009 --> 09:37.544
You wanted Anne Frank's
place to be smaller?

09:37.645 --> 09:39.112
Well, in the book
she says how cramped it is.

09:39.212 --> 09:41.314
- Right.
- But it's actually
quite spacious.

09:41.414 --> 09:44.051
Anyway, apart from that,
there's nothing else to see,

09:44.151 --> 09:45.686
really, unless
you're a drug addict.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.054
And of course
the prostitutes.

09:47.154 --> 09:50.057
And I'm six months
pregnant, you know?

09:55.629 --> 09:59.366
- What's he like?
- Oh, he's like a cunt.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.602
Yeah.

10:03.704 --> 10:06.073
( guests laughing,
chattering )

10:08.241 --> 10:10.878
( music playing )

10:38.205 --> 10:39.506
What did you think?

10:39.606 --> 10:41.942
It's really rare
to get to watch a film

10:42.042 --> 10:45.345
while the filmmaker
is sitting right there
watching you.

10:45.445 --> 10:46.613
- ( both laugh )
- Yeah.

10:46.714 --> 10:49.582
Right,
but is there anything

10:49.683 --> 10:52.185
about the piece
specifically?

10:52.285 --> 10:54.955
The important thing
isn't what I think about it.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.790
It's how do you
feel about it?

10:56.890 --> 10:59.126
I'm really proud of it.

10:59.226 --> 11:01.528
Then it's a success.

11:01.628 --> 11:03.663
Yeah.

11:03.764 --> 11:07.067
* Groove is in the heart

11:07.167 --> 11:11.438
* Groove is in
the heart *

11:11.538 --> 11:15.508
* Groove is in the heart

11:15.608 --> 11:19.412
* Grove is in
the heart *

11:26.619 --> 11:28.021
* Watch out...

11:28.121 --> 11:29.923
Kimberly?

11:30.023 --> 11:31.058
Stuart.

11:31.158 --> 11:32.525
- Stuart.
- I'm Andy's friend.

11:32.625 --> 11:33.894
We met briefly
at Margot's dinner

11:33.994 --> 11:35.062
and then I think you
came to my pool party.

11:35.162 --> 11:36.496
- Oh, the pool party.
- Yeah.

11:36.596 --> 11:37.931
It was fantastic.
Where were you?

11:38.031 --> 11:40.333
Oh, I decided to do
this other thing.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.135
- But how's it going?
Good to see you.
- It's going good.

11:42.235 --> 11:43.837
What-- what are you
doing here?

11:43.937 --> 11:45.505
Oh, Carrie
used to be my tenant.

11:45.605 --> 11:47.540
- Oh, this is so weird
you being here.
- Yeah, cool.

11:47.640 --> 11:50.010
It is weird, isn't it?
'Cause I feel like we
keep trying to meet

11:50.110 --> 11:51.979
- and then it doesn't quite--
- Yeah, it's like,
what's that word?

11:52.079 --> 11:54.047
- Kismet.
- Like fate.

11:54.147 --> 11:55.816
- Yeah, totally.
- It is, kind of-- yeah,
a little bit like that.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.284
Have you been here
the whole time?

11:57.384 --> 11:59.252
No, I was shooting, like,
really early this morning,

11:59.352 --> 12:01.254
and then we were driving
out here and I was like,

12:01.354 --> 12:02.756
"Do you ever get that thing
where you just, like,

12:02.856 --> 12:04.291
want to stop off
in the desert

12:04.391 --> 12:06.159
and just, like, be
somewhere totally random?"

12:06.259 --> 12:07.660
- All the time.
I get it all the time.
- Yeah?

12:07.761 --> 12:08.996
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:09.096 --> 12:10.197
We stopped and smoked
a joint and--

12:10.297 --> 12:11.999
Oh, cool. I love
major chill-out sessions

12:12.099 --> 12:13.834
'cause sometimes
you just need them.

12:13.934 --> 12:16.203
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, I can do
with one of them.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.878
Thank you again
for watching that.

12:24.978 --> 12:26.613
I really appreciate
the feedback.

12:26.713 --> 12:28.548
You're welcome.

12:28.648 --> 12:30.884
Is there anything
else, though?

12:30.984 --> 12:33.020
I don't need you to
treat me with kid gloves.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.856
Honestly, I'd really value
the constructive criticism.

12:35.956 --> 12:40.193
Well, in terms of the plot,
it didn't really make sense.

12:40.293 --> 12:42.262
Uh-huh.

12:44.731 --> 12:46.967
Is there anything else?

12:47.067 --> 12:49.769
I also thought
it was a bit overwrought.

12:52.072 --> 12:53.073
Hmm.

12:53.173 --> 12:54.975
( sighs )

12:55.075 --> 12:57.911
Do you think
it's possible that you
didn't respond to it

12:58.011 --> 12:59.813
because it was
a web thing

12:59.913 --> 13:02.282
and that's not really
a medium that means as much

13:02.382 --> 13:04.784
to someone
in their 50s?

13:04.885 --> 13:07.220
I'm 43.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.857
And you look great.

13:11.058 --> 13:14.661
* Groove is in the heart

13:14.761 --> 13:18.731
* Groove is in
the heart... *

13:18.832 --> 13:20.834
Still nothing.

13:21.969 --> 13:24.204
* Groove is in the heart...

13:24.304 --> 13:25.939
Kimberly:
Don't make fun of me,

13:26.039 --> 13:28.008
but I love staying home
and watching documentaries.

13:28.108 --> 13:29.776
I'm kind of a nerd.

13:29.877 --> 13:31.178
- So am I.
I'm king of the nerds.
- Really?

13:31.278 --> 13:33.680
I saw this incredible
documentary last week.

13:33.780 --> 13:35.415
- What was it about?
- It was about aliens.

13:35.515 --> 13:36.816
Okay, yeah.

13:36.917 --> 13:39.086
And it was basically
saying that aliens exist

13:39.186 --> 13:40.553
and the government's,
like, covering it up.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.455
They showed this footage,

13:42.555 --> 13:45.092
and it was basically,
like, a bright light
shooting across the sky,

13:45.192 --> 13:47.194
kind of like--
like a plane.

13:47.294 --> 13:48.761
Yeah, could it
have been a plane?

13:48.862 --> 13:50.630
- No. No.
- No? Okay.

13:50.730 --> 13:53.333
And they interviewed
this farmer 'cause
he got abducted.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.735
Why are these aliens
only ever abducting farmers

13:55.835 --> 13:57.070
and people who live
in trailer parks?

13:57.170 --> 13:58.471
Why do they never abduct,
like, the president,

13:58.571 --> 14:00.908
or someone interesting,
like, you know, Elton John?

14:01.008 --> 14:03.043
- Yeah, it's so true.
- Do you know what I mean?

14:03.143 --> 14:04.611
Yeah.

14:04.711 --> 14:06.246
You're really,
really fun to talk to.

14:06.346 --> 14:09.116
I don't meet many guys
that can debate like this.

14:09.216 --> 14:10.918
Who are you
normally meeting?

14:11.018 --> 14:13.286
Mostly, like, male models,
but they're so dumb.

14:13.386 --> 14:16.156
Ugh, well, that's why
they went into modeling--
into male modeling.

14:16.256 --> 14:19.126
Yeah. Um...
we should have
an after-party.

14:19.226 --> 14:20.727
- ( gasps )
- Yeah.

14:20.827 --> 14:22.262
- I could do
an after-party.
- Yeah?

14:22.362 --> 14:23.897
- Yeah, in my room?
Yeah, sure, sure.
- Yay.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.532
You know what?
I think we're gonna crash.

14:25.632 --> 14:26.967
Yeah, we're gonna go to bed--
I'm gonna go to bed.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.768
( gasps )
You guys are so boring.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.437
When did you
become so boring?

14:30.537 --> 14:31.972
You're so boring.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.706
- ( scoffs )
- So boring.

14:33.806 --> 14:35.408
- Aw.
- Yeah.

14:35.508 --> 14:38.946
Well, listen, I was just
gonna go back to my room

14:39.046 --> 14:40.347
and just have a bit
of another chill sesh

14:40.447 --> 14:41.814
and just listen to
some tunes if you wanna--

14:41.915 --> 14:42.815
( gasps )
Can I DJ?

14:42.916 --> 14:44.351
You can only come
if you DJ.

14:44.451 --> 14:45.852
- Really? Okay, cool.
- Yeah, that's the rules.

14:45.953 --> 14:47.654
I just have to say bye
to some friends.

14:47.754 --> 14:49.189
- Okay.
- I'll be literally,
like two minutes.

14:49.289 --> 14:50.991
- What's your room number?
- 219.

14:51.091 --> 14:53.626
- Okay, I'll see you then.
- Yeah, see you in a bit.

14:59.832 --> 15:01.534
( sloshing )

15:17.550 --> 15:19.719
( knock on door )

15:19.819 --> 15:21.354
Hello?

15:21.454 --> 15:23.590
Hi, it's Kimberly!

15:23.690 --> 15:25.258
Give me a second.

15:31.664 --> 15:33.500
- Hi, I'm so sorry.
- Hey.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.469
I got caught up talking
and I completely lost
track of time.

15:36.569 --> 15:38.305
Oh, don't worry about it.
No, please, yeah, come in.

15:38.405 --> 15:40.207
Make yourself--
what are you drinking?

15:40.307 --> 15:43.010
I've recently
dabbled in scotch,
so maybe a scotch?

15:43.110 --> 15:44.544
- Sure, yeah.
- Yeah?

15:44.644 --> 15:46.246
- Better late than never.
- I'm gonna put on some tunes.

15:46.346 --> 15:48.548
- Oh, please do.
- Get this party started.

15:48.648 --> 15:49.849
Yes. Oh.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.718
Happy with the 13-year-old
single malt?

15:51.818 --> 15:53.153
- Fantastic.
- ( music playing )

15:53.253 --> 15:55.688
- I love 13-year-olds.
- ( laughs )

15:57.524 --> 15:58.825
I love this one.

15:58.925 --> 16:00.827
- It's fantastic, right?
- Yeah.

16:00.927 --> 16:02.895
- Oh, yeah.
- Take a seat.

16:02.996 --> 16:05.765
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

16:05.865 --> 16:07.167
Oh, yeah, classic.

16:07.267 --> 16:09.836
- To kismet.
- To kismet.

16:09.936 --> 16:11.971
( knock on door )

16:12.072 --> 16:15.008
Mm, mm-hmm.
It's Paul.

16:16.376 --> 16:18.045
Who's Paul?

16:19.246 --> 16:20.913
Hi, come in,
come in, come in.

16:21.014 --> 16:23.983
- How are you?
- ( whispers ) We gotta
get rid of this guy.

16:24.084 --> 16:25.918
( Kimberly laughs )
What?

16:26.019 --> 16:27.787
Stop.

16:27.887 --> 16:29.622
This is Stuart.
Stuart's amazing.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.424
Stuart, this is Paul.

16:31.524 --> 16:32.859
- I wouldn't
say amazing, but--
- How's it going?

16:32.959 --> 16:34.661
Hi, how's it going?

16:34.761 --> 16:37.597
Ah, I'm sorry.
I'm sat there.

16:37.697 --> 16:39.532
Yeah.

16:39.632 --> 16:42.135
Paul, can I get you
something to drink?
Maybe a scotch?

16:42.235 --> 16:45.004
- Love scotch.
- Cool.

16:52.712 --> 16:54.614
Here you go.

16:54.714 --> 16:58.318
So, Paul, you should
totally have Stuart
do your new website.

16:58.418 --> 16:59.919
He has a web
design business.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.288
Oh, you do web design?

17:01.388 --> 17:03.956
It's a gig, you know.
Pays the bills.

17:04.057 --> 17:06.959
- What do you do?
- He DJs for Kanye West.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.395
Do ya?

17:09.396 --> 17:11.164
Is that
a new tattoo, Paul?

17:11.264 --> 17:13.300
Yeah, I got it
in Thailand.

17:13.400 --> 17:16.136
- ( gasps )
- It's the Buddhist symbol
for hope.

17:16.236 --> 17:17.604
It's beautiful.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.507
Oh, I love Buddhism.
Can I just take
a look at that?

17:20.607 --> 17:22.775
- Kanye got inner peace.
- Oh, it's amazing-- really?

17:22.875 --> 17:24.311
- Typical Kanye.
- Yeah, yeah.

17:24.411 --> 17:26.246
Hey, dude,
can I get a refill?

17:26.346 --> 17:28.448
Totally, man.
The bar's just there.

17:28.548 --> 17:31.984
- Oh, right.
- Can I get another
scotch as well?

17:32.085 --> 17:33.620
- Yeah.
- Please?

17:33.720 --> 17:35.054
( gasps )
You know what
would be amazing?

17:35.155 --> 17:36.456
Is if we got
room service.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.425
I missed the dinner
and I'm so hungry.

17:38.525 --> 17:40.026
- Is that okay?
- Sure, yeah.

17:40.127 --> 17:41.928
Do you want to order
some room service, mate?

17:42.028 --> 17:43.330
Sure.

17:43.430 --> 17:45.232
Yeah, I was thinking
of getting a tattoo--

17:45.332 --> 17:49.035
Oh, let's see
what they have.
I'm starving.

17:49.136 --> 17:50.370
Kimberly:
Ooh, that looks good.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.038
- Paul: Yeah.
- Kimberly: Hmm.

17:52.139 --> 17:54.741
Let me have a look here,
see what's going--

17:54.841 --> 17:56.109
sorry, can I see that?

17:56.209 --> 17:58.345
I'm thinking maybe steak?
Like, filet mignon?

17:58.445 --> 18:00.480
It seems a bit late
for filet mignon, is it?

18:00.580 --> 18:02.149
Why don't I just get
a bunch of stuff?

18:02.249 --> 18:03.750
It's a brilliant idea.

18:03.850 --> 18:05.718
Oh, but you know what?
I don't have that much
cash on me.

18:05.818 --> 18:07.620
- That's a shame.
- We can just charge it
to the room.

18:07.720 --> 18:11.291
Genius, that's fantastic.
Okay, thank you so much.

18:17.330 --> 18:19.232
I don't know.
Maybe she's right.

18:19.332 --> 18:22.235
Maybe it is overwrought.

18:22.335 --> 18:26.873
Maybe I'm not a good
actor or a writer.

18:26.973 --> 18:28.541
( sighs ) I have
all these ambitions,

18:28.641 --> 18:31.211
but honestly,
what if I'm just
not good enough?

18:31.311 --> 18:33.112
Don't worry
about her, okay?

18:33.213 --> 18:36.383
Think she's having
as much fun as you
are right now?

18:36.483 --> 18:38.385
I mean, what does she
even mean by "overwrought"?

18:38.485 --> 18:41.087
It's not overwrought.
It's passionate.

18:41.188 --> 18:42.755
Why is she
criticizing me

18:42.855 --> 18:45.892
for trying to do something
that's honest and raw?

18:45.992 --> 18:48.195
Don't work yourself
up about it, okay?

18:48.295 --> 18:50.897
It's only a web series.
No one's ever gonna see it.

18:52.465 --> 18:56.068
I mean-- I didn't mean
no one's gonna see it.

18:56.169 --> 18:59.872
- Um, I'm gonna go.
- Wait, just--

19:01.374 --> 19:03.210
- Jessica, I'm--
- No, it's fine.

19:03.310 --> 19:05.011
It's fine. It's fine.
I'm just gonna take a walk.

19:05.111 --> 19:07.180
( sighs )

19:12.118 --> 19:15.255
Is the gratuity included
in the $185?

19:15.355 --> 19:17.757
- No, sir.
- No? Great.

19:17.857 --> 19:19.892
This steak
looks fantastic.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.329
Thanks.

19:22.429 --> 19:23.763
- Stuart: Good?
- Yeah, it's good.

19:23.863 --> 19:25.998
Oh, cool.

19:26.098 --> 19:27.567
Yeah. Hmm.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.537
Is that all
you're gonna have?

19:30.637 --> 19:33.740
Well, I don't know.
I might save some
for later.

19:33.840 --> 19:37.544
One piece of steak
for a model is a full meal.

19:37.644 --> 19:38.611
Oh, shut up.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.012
( laughs )
Whoa.

19:40.112 --> 19:41.781
I'm surprised
you can throw that far,

19:41.881 --> 19:43.082
you're so weak
from hunger.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.918
- You're such a jerk.
- You are.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.154
Fuck off, Paul.
Jesus.

19:48.255 --> 19:50.257
Yeah, fuck off, Paul.

19:50.357 --> 19:52.592
Two against one.
Hang on, I gotta regroup.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.193
Hey, where's
your bathroom, man?

19:54.294 --> 19:56.529
- Just, yeah, there.
- Oh, yeah.

19:56.629 --> 19:57.897
As you'd expect.

20:00.667 --> 20:01.934
( sighs )

20:09.141 --> 20:10.943
Sit down.

20:13.012 --> 20:14.947
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:16.449 --> 20:18.918
So, I was not fucking
ready to see Paul today.

20:19.018 --> 20:20.920
- Yeah, what's
his fucking deal?
- No, he's a great guy.

20:21.020 --> 20:23.323
He seems like a good guy.
I thought that straight
away when he came in.

20:23.423 --> 20:26.459
But I was just--
I don't know.
I was maybe hoping

20:26.559 --> 20:29.262
that you could maybe
give us a little privacy?

20:29.362 --> 20:32.299
- Why?
- To catch up.

20:34.367 --> 20:35.968
You-- what,
in my room?

20:36.068 --> 20:37.637
I completely spaced
getting a room

20:37.737 --> 20:39.372
and he's staying
with this guy, Luke,

20:39.472 --> 20:41.040
and Luke's hooking up
with this girl...

20:41.140 --> 20:42.409
Oh, is he?
I met Luke earlier.

20:42.509 --> 20:43.710
He seemed like
another good guy.

20:43.810 --> 20:47.380
Please? I would
owe you for eternity.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.418
- All right.
- Oh, you're amazing.

20:51.518 --> 20:54.621
Thank you so much.
You're fantastic.

20:58.325 --> 21:02.028
I just remembered
I gotta pop down to
the business center,

21:02.128 --> 21:05.131
do some faxing.

21:05.231 --> 21:07.634
- Cool.
See you later, man.
- Yeah.

21:12.572 --> 21:15.842
- ( talking softly )
- ( laughing )

21:28.120 --> 21:29.889
Stuart:
Hey.

21:29.989 --> 21:31.958
Oh, hey.

21:33.025 --> 21:34.627
What are you up to?

21:34.727 --> 21:37.029
Mm, just stealing
some silverware.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.366
Good move.
Looks like you've done
a hell of a job.

21:39.466 --> 21:41.734
- ( laughs )
- Cleaned 'em out.

21:41.834 --> 21:43.536
Where's Kimberly?

21:43.636 --> 21:46.839
Kimberly is in my room.

21:46.939 --> 21:50.142
Why did you leave her
in your room alone?

21:50.242 --> 21:52.645
Oh, no, no, no.
She's-- she's not alone.

21:52.745 --> 21:55.448
No, she's with Paul.
Do you know Paul?

21:55.548 --> 21:58.451
He DJs for Kanye West
and he's got a lot
of tattoos.

21:58.551 --> 22:00.453
- He loves
a bit of free steak.
- Oh, I love Paul.

22:00.553 --> 22:02.522
Do you like Paul?
Yeah, everyone seems
to love Paul.

22:03.756 --> 22:06.993
Why did you let them
use your room?

22:07.093 --> 22:09.128
I have a more-- I have,
like, a long-term plan.

22:09.228 --> 22:10.363
- Oh.
- Which is that
when she's tired

22:10.463 --> 22:11.798
of dating these kinds
of assholes,

22:11.898 --> 22:13.700
she'll remember how
sweet and lovely I am

22:13.800 --> 22:15.568
and then that's when
I get my chance.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.003
Stuart, why do you
try so hard?

22:17.103 --> 22:19.005
Just be yourself.
It's easy.

22:19.105 --> 22:21.841
That's just terrible advice
because I've been myself
for 35 years

22:21.941 --> 22:24.977
and that's got me nowhere,
so I'm gonna be Paul
from now on.

22:25.077 --> 22:26.613
No, you don't need
to be Paul.

22:26.713 --> 22:28.681
Why do you keep trying
to date supermodels?

22:28.781 --> 22:31.851
Just date, like,
a normal person.

22:31.951 --> 22:33.886
Why would I want to spend
any time with normal people?

22:33.986 --> 22:35.755
I'm one of
the normal people.
Look at me.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.356
This is what
normal people look like.

22:37.457 --> 22:38.925
There's nothing wrong
with normal people.

22:39.025 --> 22:41.060
- I'm a normal.
- No, you're way above normal.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.929
- I'm above normal?
- You're definitely
above normal, yeah.

22:43.029 --> 22:44.764
Oh, thank you.

22:44.864 --> 22:47.400
You're definitely
above-- you're, like,
three feet above normal.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.902
- That's good.
- ( laughs )

22:50.002 --> 22:52.639
Your looks and your
personality are fine.

22:52.739 --> 22:55.742
The biggest problem
you have is your dancing.

22:55.842 --> 22:58.611
- No, I will not hear this.
- I've been watching you.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.980
- I'm one of
the great dancers.
- I saw you dancing.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.314
- It's really weird.
- No.

23:02.415 --> 23:03.916
All right,
we can settle this

23:04.016 --> 23:06.385
because I am well known
throughout England

23:06.486 --> 23:07.654
for having
moves like Jagger.

23:07.754 --> 23:09.355
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

23:09.456 --> 23:12.124
- ( music playing )
- Oh, my-- oh.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.594
- Yeah.
- ( laughing ) Okay.

23:17.530 --> 23:19.065
You look like one
of those inflatable men

23:19.165 --> 23:20.933
that's outside
of a car dealership.

23:21.033 --> 23:24.437
- That's what I'm going for.
- Okay. Ahem.

23:24.537 --> 23:27.006
This is how you
dance to this music.

23:27.106 --> 23:29.008
Are you ready?
Watch me.

23:32.111 --> 23:33.580
Use your hips,
not just--

23:33.680 --> 23:35.281
People like this.
This is a very
popular move.

23:35.381 --> 23:37.617
Okay.
Follow me, ready?

23:40.252 --> 23:41.821
Good.
Use your hips.

23:41.921 --> 23:44.524
Like, bend down--
there you go.

23:44.624 --> 23:47.293
Good.
Good face, yeah.

23:47.393 --> 23:49.562
Good face.
Good.

23:51.531 --> 23:53.833
You're too tall to dance
with a human woman.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.802
That is why I aim
for supermodels.

23:55.902 --> 23:58.037
Although you do have
a nice concave chest

23:58.137 --> 23:59.539
for me to rest my head on.

23:59.639 --> 24:03.309
* ...to better
suit your mood *

24:03.409 --> 24:08.314
* Because
you're so smooth *

24:08.414 --> 24:10.583
* And it's just like
the ocean *

24:10.683 --> 24:12.719
- * Under the moon...
- Oh.

24:12.819 --> 24:16.689
* It's the same as the emotion
that I get from you *

24:16.789 --> 24:20.527
* You've got the kind of lovin'
that can be so smooth *

24:20.627 --> 24:23.329
* Yeah, gimme your heart,
make it real *

24:23.429 --> 24:25.932
* Or else
forget about it... *

24:29.035 --> 24:30.637
Uh-oh.

24:30.737 --> 24:32.872
There he goes.
( laughing )

24:45.652 --> 24:47.554
Glenn:
You got it.

24:48.688 --> 24:50.690
You got the fucking part.

24:50.790 --> 24:54.360
- I got it?
- Yeah.

24:54.460 --> 24:56.495
Oh, my God!

24:56.596 --> 24:57.897
Oh, my God!
I got it?

24:57.997 --> 24:59.932
- What did they say?
- Shane just emailed me.

25:00.032 --> 25:01.400
A press release
goes out tomorrow.

25:01.500 --> 25:04.270
You are a lead
on network prime time.

25:04.370 --> 25:06.606
- ( laughs )
- Oh, my God.

25:06.706 --> 25:08.908
Oh, my God.
( squeals )

25:09.008 --> 25:11.678
- Oh, this is crazy.
- Amazing!

25:11.778 --> 25:13.345
Ah!

25:13.445 --> 25:15.181
This is crazy.

25:15.281 --> 25:17.083
Oh, my God.
Can I call my mom?
Is it too late?

25:17.183 --> 25:18.951
- Of course you
can call your mom.
- What time is it?

25:19.051 --> 25:21.353
- It's 2:00, but--
- Should I start
emailing people?

25:21.453 --> 25:24.557
- Yeah, it's your role.
- What did they say?
Read the email back.

25:57.023 --> 25:58.257
Stuart?

25:58.357 --> 26:01.293
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:01.393 --> 26:04.430
So, uh...
I'm gonna take off,

26:04.530 --> 26:08.300
but I just wanted to
say sorry for last night,

26:08.400 --> 26:10.102
and thanks.

26:10.202 --> 26:11.503
You were really sweet.

26:11.604 --> 26:13.673
Don't worry about it.
It's fine.

26:13.773 --> 26:16.242
It was a bit weird
with Paul here, I know,

26:16.342 --> 26:17.877
and I was a bit drunk.

26:17.977 --> 26:19.746
He left and he, like,
didn't even say bye.

26:19.846 --> 26:20.913
- Really?
- Yeah.

26:21.013 --> 26:23.015
I have the worst
taste in men.

26:23.115 --> 26:24.250
Yeah?

26:24.350 --> 26:26.719
I just wish I could
find, like, a nice guy.

26:26.819 --> 26:28.888
There's some out there.

26:28.988 --> 26:30.823
- Thanks again.
- Yeah.

26:32.959 --> 26:34.226
Bye.

26:41.233 --> 26:44.637
* Some expression
in your eyes... *

26:44.737 --> 26:46.238
( door closes )

26:48.507 --> 26:52.645
* Overtook me
by surprise *

26:54.781 --> 26:56.548
* Where was I?

26:56.649 --> 27:01.453
* How was I to know

27:01.553 --> 27:04.156
* Oh

27:04.256 --> 27:09.328
* How can we drive
to a movie show... *

27:09.428 --> 27:10.797
( phone chimes )

27:10.897 --> 27:16.102
* When the music
is here in my car? *

27:17.737 --> 27:21.040
* There's a band playing

27:21.140 --> 27:23.976
* On the radio

27:24.076 --> 27:26.813
* Oh...

27:27.646 --> 27:29.816
( knocks )

27:32.651 --> 27:35.421
- Hello, mate.
- Hey.

27:37.623 --> 27:39.726
* There's a band playing

27:39.826 --> 27:43.863
* On the radio

27:43.963 --> 27:49.268
* With a rhythm
of rhyming guitars *

27:51.037 --> 27:53.405
* There's a band playing

27:53.505 --> 27:57.744
* On the radio

27:57.844 --> 28:02.849
* And it's drowning
the sound of my tears *

28:04.450 --> 28:10.222
* They're playing,
oh, yeah, on the radio *

28:10.322 --> 28:13.760
* Oh

28:17.229 --> 28:19.932
* Oh

28:23.669 --> 28:26.472
* Oh.
