who take her into a hideaway

at you.

There won't always be something around
for you to climb on,

08:05.818 --> 08:07.862
so you need to learn
to mount from the ground.

Go, Lucky, go.

09:29.026 --> 09:32.196

for Lucky?

In a way, you could say it's
for everybody who wants to learn.

09:49.380 --> 09:50.881
But in another way, it's for Lucky.

09:51.465 --> 09:54.427

with stars, Pru.

09:54.510 --> 09:58.264
You have better sense than that.
And shouldn't you be fixin' the barn?

to go on that ride.

10:00.891 --> 10:03.728

Everything's under control.

10:04.645 --> 10:06.480
Everything's under control.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.232
Mm-hmm.

10:09.734 --> 10:10.943
[Pru laughs]

10:12.194 --> 10:14.947
A big part of riding is taking care
of your tack.

10:15.031 --> 10:17.575
-Spirit doesn't use tack.
-[Pru] Maybe he should.

10:17.658 --> 10:19.827
A saddle would make jumping a lot easier.

10:20.411 --> 10:23.039
I don't think Spirit is going to want
to wear a saddle.

10:23.122 --> 10:25.374
Since we only have two days left
to practice...

10:26.292 --> 10:27.627

10:30.296 --> 10:31.672
One day.

10:33.341 --> 10:34.634

10:34.717 --> 10:37.678
Well, sure, not yet.
But we still have tomorrow.

10:37.762 --> 10:39.180
To learn how to jump?

10:39.263 --> 10:40.306

10:50.900 --> 10:52.610
Do you want to make one for Spirit?

10:52.693 --> 10:54.362
No point. He won't stay inside.

11:34.860 --> 11:37.488
The most important thing you need
as a rider is confidence.

11:37.571 --> 11:39.156
Once you commit to a jump,

11:40.241 --> 11:41.409
you can't hesitate.

11:41.492 --> 11:43.702
You have to trust your horse
to take you through the course.

11:44.286 --> 11:45.746
I do trust Spirit.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.540
Good! We'll start with a small jump.

11:47.623 --> 11:51.043
Now, remember to lean forward and relax.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.920
[whinnies]

12:00.094 --> 12:01.679
[whimpers]

12:01.762 --> 12:03.305
[neighs]

12:05.057 --> 12:07.184
Okay, good, only this time

12:07.268 --> 12:08.978
when you lean forward and relax,

12:09.061 --> 12:11.439
try leaning forward and relaxing.

12:11.522 --> 12:13.941
-[chuffs and whinnies]
-Hyah!

12:26.412 --> 12:28.414
[Pru] Come on, Lucky. Try it again!

12:33.836 --> 12:36.839
[grunts] Whoo!

12:36.922 --> 12:40.050
-[laughs]
-Yeah, Lucky!

12:44.388 --> 12:46.307
This is it! The ride's tomorrow.

12:46.390 --> 12:49.477
If you can make it over that last jump,
you'll be ready.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.023
[chuffs]

12:54.106 --> 12:55.733
[Lucky grunts]

12:55.816 --> 12:57.234
I think she's gonna do it!

13:05.117 --> 13:06.410
[whimpers]

13:06.494 --> 13:08.078
Whoa, Spirit! Whoa!

13:08.162 --> 13:09.747
-[neighs]
-[grunts]

13:09.830 --> 13:10.956
[both gasp]

13:12.666 --> 13:13.667
I couldn't do it.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.544
It was just too high.

13:15.628 --> 13:16.629
It's okay.

13:16.712 --> 13:18.005
You worked really hard.

13:18.088 --> 13:20.674
It just takes time to get confident
jumping a horse.

13:21.175 --> 13:23.677
Maybe if I was with the rest
of the Saddle Club...

13:24.303 --> 13:25.930
If you can't jump here,

13:26.013 --> 13:28.182
there's just no way you'll be able
to jump there.

13:28.766 --> 13:29.767
[sighs]

13:30.434 --> 13:32.728
But just think how good you'll be
by next year.

13:32.811 --> 13:35.564
Well, thanks for helping me try.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.525
You guys are good friends.

13:38.359 --> 13:39.944
Have fun on the ride tomorrow.

13:40.027 --> 13:41.820
[chuffs]

13:50.621 --> 13:54.375
[grunts] I can't do this! It's too hard!

13:54.458 --> 13:56.335
Everything here is too hard!

13:56.418 --> 13:59.088
Lucky! What kind of attitude is that?

13:59.171 --> 14:01.048
-A bad one.
-Nonsense.

14:01.131 --> 14:04.677
You're a Prescott,
and Prescotts don't quit!

14:04.760 --> 14:07.596
We keep at it until we've mastered
what we've started,

14:07.680 --> 14:10.599
and we have a beautiful pie for supper.

14:11.642 --> 14:13.310
Wow!

14:13.394 --> 14:14.979
I can't believe you kept trying

14:15.062 --> 14:17.565
after you made all those awful pies!

14:18.691 --> 14:20.317
And so many of them!

14:21.193 --> 14:22.653
But you didn't give up!

14:22.736 --> 14:24.947
No, I certainly did not.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.741
Then I won't give up either!

14:27.825 --> 14:30.077
-Thanks, Aunt Cora.
-Oh! You're welcome.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.996
Wait. Where are you going?

14:32.079 --> 14:34.164
[Lucky] To be a Prescott!

14:39.253 --> 14:40.337
[whinnies]

14:40.921 --> 14:42.798
Come on, Spirit. We're so close!

14:42.882 --> 14:44.800
If we can just make that last jump,

14:44.884 --> 14:46.719
-we can go on the ride.
-[chuffs]

14:47.595 --> 14:50.556
-Ready?
-[neighs]

14:55.895 --> 14:57.396
No, not ready!

14:57.479 --> 14:58.397
[gasps and screams]

14:58.480 --> 14:59.607
[neighs]

15:01.901 --> 15:02.902
[gasps]

15:05.946 --> 15:07.156
[sighs]

15:08.365 --> 15:11.368
[whistling]

15:14.455 --> 15:15.915
Uh-oh.

15:17.666 --> 15:19.668
Pru! You're in big trouble, missy.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.630
-It's not her fault, Mr. Granger.
-[scoffs]

15:22.713 --> 15:25.966
I told you a million times,
you are responsible for this girl.

15:26.050 --> 15:30.262
And because you weren't watching out
for her, my fence is now a gate!

15:30.846 --> 15:33.724
But I wasn't even here!
How is it my fault?

15:33.807 --> 15:37.811
You let her think she'd be able to learn
a lifetime of riding in three days!

15:39.480 --> 15:40.773
You know better than that.

15:41.398 --> 15:44.693
I just wanted her to be able to come
on the Saddle Club ride with us.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.779
Oh, you're not going on any ride.

15:47.404 --> 15:48.906
[gasps] That's not fair!

15:48.989 --> 15:50.157
The barn is fixed!

15:50.240 --> 15:51.909
And my fence is broke!

15:51.992 --> 15:54.453
You're grounded from the ride,
and that's final.

15:54.536 --> 15:56.580
Now get this fence back up.

16:00.459 --> 16:03.170
[sighs] I expected better from you, Pru.

16:06.924 --> 16:09.426
I am so, so, so sorry!

16:09.510 --> 16:10.970
What were you doing here?

16:11.053 --> 16:12.763
I thought we agreed you weren't ready!

16:12.846 --> 16:16.517
[stammers] I know, but I was practicing,
and I was so close.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.394
And you hesitated, right?

16:19.853 --> 16:22.731
Because you're not ready, Lucky!
Like I told you!

16:22.815 --> 16:27.111
And now my dad's mad at me,
and I'm gonna miss the Saddle Club ride.

16:27.194 --> 16:28.988
I know, and I'm really sorry!

16:29.071 --> 16:30.572
I feel terrible!

16:30.656 --> 16:32.032
I'll help you fix it.

16:32.116 --> 16:34.243
You've done enough helping for one day.

16:34.952 --> 16:37.371
How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?

16:37.454 --> 16:40.249
I'm sorry about your fence.
I'm sorry you can't go on the ride.

16:40.332 --> 16:42.042
I'm sorry I got you in trouble.

16:42.126 --> 16:44.628
Well, I'm sorry you don't know how
to ride a horse!

16:46.171 --> 16:50.259
Oh, I know how to ride a horse! [grunts]

16:50.342 --> 16:52.636
Yeah, Lucky. You're a natural.

17:03.772 --> 17:05.357
Uh...

17:08.610 --> 17:11.071
I just can't believe her.

17:11.155 --> 17:12.865
Telling me what to do.

17:15.826 --> 17:17.202
[nickers]

17:19.997 --> 17:21.999
-Hyah!
-[neighs]

17:26.879 --> 17:30.466
[Snips] Now who's ready
for the ride of a lifetime?

17:30.549 --> 17:33.343
[boy] Let's go!
[Snips] Hope you guys like donkey butt!

17:33.427 --> 17:37.389
-[boys cheering]
-[Abigail crying]

17:38.724 --> 17:40.809
-Abigail.
-Ow.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.895
Why aren't you on the Saddle Club ride?

17:43.812 --> 17:46.231
I wasn't gonna go without my friends!

17:46.315 --> 17:48.358
The whole point was to do it together.

17:48.442 --> 17:51.403
[sighs] Lucky really messed things up
for all of us.

17:53.989 --> 17:56.450
-What?
-You're being a little unfair to Lucky.

17:56.533 --> 17:57.534
Unfair?

17:57.618 --> 18:00.037
Did you see what she did to my fence?

18:00.120 --> 18:03.207
It was an accident.
You wouldn't even listen to her apology.

18:03.290 --> 18:05.793
Ow! Quit it, Boomerang.

18:05.876 --> 18:08.670
[whinnies]

18:08.754 --> 18:12.424
Lucky did everything you asked her to.
She tried as hard as she could.

18:12.508 --> 18:14.760
Well, I tried as hard as I could, too.

18:14.843 --> 18:17.846
I know. But remember,
Lucky's new at all of this.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.431
It's gonna take time.

18:19.515 --> 18:21.767
And as her friends,
we have to give it to her.

18:25.521 --> 18:26.772
[grunts]

18:27.856 --> 18:29.399
[neighs]

18:30.943 --> 18:33.779
- Pru thinks she's so good at everything.
-[nickers]

18:33.862 --> 18:35.948
She's not the president of horses.

18:37.241 --> 18:38.367
Let's show 'em what we can do!

18:38.450 --> 18:39.451
[whinnies]

18:39.535 --> 18:40.953
Hyah!

18:43.705 --> 18:44.832
Ha! See?

18:44.915 --> 18:46.250
This isn't so hard!

18:46.333 --> 18:48.001
[chuffs]

18:54.508 --> 18:55.467
[whimpers]

18:55.551 --> 18:56.760
Aah!

18:56.844 --> 18:57.928
[gasps]

18:59.346 --> 19:00.681
Whoa, boy. Whoa!

19:00.764 --> 19:02.516
[neighs]

19:04.184 --> 19:05.435
They were right.

19:05.519 --> 19:06.728
I'm not ready for this.

19:06.812 --> 19:09.064
I can't do it. I can't do it.

19:09.773 --> 19:12.401
It's too hard. It's too high!

19:12.484 --> 19:15.988
This is terrible! I've gotta get down!

19:16.071 --> 19:19.241
-[neighs]
-Whoa! Ah. Ah!

19:20.993 --> 19:22.494
Whoa.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.454
Oh, why didn't I listen to Pru?

19:24.538 --> 19:28.000
I don't know how to ride a horse.
I've gotta walk.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.626
[neighs]

19:29.710 --> 19:31.461
No, it's too high!

19:31.545 --> 19:32.671
[neighs]

19:33.213 --> 19:35.090
Uh! Aah!

19:35.174 --> 19:36.800
[neighs]

19:36.884 --> 19:39.636
[screams, grunts]

19:40.637 --> 19:43.015
[nickers]

19:43.098 --> 19:44.850
[panting and crying]

19:44.933 --> 19:46.643
[winces]

19:48.395 --> 19:49.813
Are you hurt?

19:50.522 --> 19:53.734
Oh, Spirit. I'm so sorry, boy.
Can you walk?

19:54.776 --> 19:56.528
[nickers]

20:09.541 --> 20:10.709
[Spirit whinnies]

20:13.754 --> 20:15.214
Lucky!

20:15.923 --> 20:17.841
[gasps] What happened?

20:18.425 --> 20:23.138
I-I took Spirit down that trail
you said was too hard.

20:23.222 --> 20:26.016
I wanted to prove that we could,

20:26.099 --> 20:27.351
but I hesitated.

20:27.434 --> 20:28.852
And I hurt Spirit!

20:28.936 --> 20:30.145
Where's he hurt?

20:30.229 --> 20:31.855
Here, his leg.

20:32.439 --> 20:35.275
I was mad and only thinking about myself.

20:35.359 --> 20:37.569
It's okay. He sprained it.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.821
But he'll be fine
after a good night's sleep.

20:39.905 --> 20:41.031
Really?

20:41.114 --> 20:42.241
[nickers]

20:45.202 --> 20:47.162
Let's get him inside so he can rest.

20:54.503 --> 20:55.587
[gasps]

21:01.677 --> 21:03.553
This is wonderful!

21:03.637 --> 21:07.182
Only you know Spirit
won't let himself be shut in.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.684
He won't have to be!

21:08.767 --> 21:11.353
Now Spirit can come and go
whenever he wants!

21:24.199 --> 21:25.867
[nickers]

21:31.206 --> 21:32.958
I can't believe you did this for us.

21:33.041 --> 21:35.585
We just wanted to show you that we--

21:35.669 --> 21:37.963
that I was sorry.

21:38.046 --> 21:39.589
I shouldn't have gotten so mad.

21:39.673 --> 21:41.258
I'm sorry too.

21:41.341 --> 21:45.137
I should have trusted Spirit and you.

21:45.220 --> 21:46.972
But I'm going to keep working on it.

21:47.055 --> 21:49.224
We'll be here for you, Lucky.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.768
No matter how long it takes.

21:51.852 --> 21:53.395
Aww!

21:57.899 --> 21:59.318
[nickers]

21:59.943 --> 22:02.070
Hey, you! Feeling better?

22:02.154 --> 22:05.157
[whinnies and chuffs]

22:08.327 --> 22:11.288
[laughs]

22:11.371 --> 22:13.290
You up for a ride?

22:13.373 --> 22:14.541
[grunts]

22:16.168 --> 22:17.085
[sighs]

22:17.169 --> 22:19.046

22:23.550 --> 22:24.968
[chuffs]

22:27.804 --> 22:29.890
[grunts]

22:29.973 --> 22:31.600
We'll still take it easy today.

22:31.683 --> 22:33.518
There's no rush.

22:33.602 --> 22:35.687
[neighs]
