01:42.320 --> 01:44.400
What is this place?

01:51.840 --> 01:53.840
No-one comes here.

01:57.600 --> 01:59.600
You look beautiful.

02:00.480 --> 02:02.480
That's my mum's.

02:05.440 --> 02:09.060
What if something should happen
to the baby?

02:09.160 --> 02:13.700
Maybe we should...tell someone
that we're here.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.560
Everything you need
is right here.

03:46.440 --> 03:49.100
Isaac!

03:49.200 --> 03:52.220
Look, I-I didn't kill him!

03:52.320 --> 03:55.680
It's me. Sam.

04:07.400 --> 04:10.940
Look. You remember that, right?

04:11.040 --> 04:14.800
And I know about Annie,
your mum.

04:40.160 --> 04:41.860
Thank you. Thank you.

04:59.280 --> 05:01.280
What are you doing?

05:07.960 --> 05:10.960
There's no-one at the farm.
They've cleared out.

05:12.400 --> 05:13.900
No idea where.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.060
What did she say
in the message?

05:17.160 --> 05:19.600
That she didn't feel safe.

05:21.360 --> 05:23.560
That she needed my help.

05:25.920 --> 05:28.940
She sounded terrified.

05:29.040 --> 05:32.440
What will happen to the baby
if she reverts to her own age?

05:34.120 --> 05:36.320
She'll have to come back
for more.

05:37.880 --> 05:39.980
I think I saw Herb.

05:40.080 --> 05:43.100
Yesterday when I dropped
his jacket back.

05:43.200 --> 05:45.920
He wasn't in his wheelchair.

06:40.440 --> 06:42.300
What the hell, Dave?

06:42.400 --> 06:44.340
You can't be here, mate.

06:44.440 --> 06:46.440
You're still suspended...

07:05.200 --> 07:07.200
Zacky?

07:09.200 --> 07:11.200
Isaac!

07:18.480 --> 07:21.180
Honey?

07:21.280 --> 07:23.420
The national anthem
of Hungary.

07:40.200 --> 07:42.740
Whatever they say about me

07:42.840 --> 07:45.380
I want you to know
I didn't do it.

07:45.480 --> 07:47.480
OK.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.400
But I'd never, ever
do that to you.

07:53.400 --> 07:55.340
Who...

07:55.440 --> 07:57.440
Who are you?

08:14.560 --> 08:16.560
Rhonda!

08:18.360 --> 08:20.360
What is it?

08:21.040 --> 08:23.500
-It's Griffo.
-What?

08:23.600 --> 08:25.600
He's, um...

08:26.760 --> 08:29.680
I need you to come down
to the station.

09:24.640 --> 09:26.640
Yes?

09:29.880 --> 09:33.160
-Can I help you?
-Um...

09:35.440 --> 09:37.220
Frank Warlie?

09:37.320 --> 09:39.320
Yes.

09:40.120 --> 09:42.400
35th Squadron?

09:43.400 --> 09:45.500
Yes.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.600
I'm...

09:50.400 --> 09:51.500
..er...

09:51.600 --> 09:54.660
..I'm with the RAAF
Ex-Servicemen Association.

09:54.760 --> 09:59.340
I'm here to return your jacket.
If this was yours.

09:59.440 --> 10:01.560
Ah... Ha!

10:03.040 --> 10:05.040
Good heavens!

10:05.800 --> 10:09.240
Um... Come in, come in.

10:43.080 --> 10:45.440
It's so weird, isn't it?

10:46.720 --> 10:49.000
I never needed to worry.

10:50.120 --> 10:52.680
Everything's as it should be.

10:55.440 --> 10:56.460
Sweetheart?

10:56.560 --> 10:58.500
-Gwennie?

10:58.600 --> 11:00.820
-Hey.

11:00.920 --> 11:04.260
-Sweetheart. Sweetheart.

11:04.360 --> 11:06.460
Is that a cramp?

11:06.560 --> 11:08.380
-Is it the baby or...?
-I don't know.

11:08.480 --> 11:10.980
-Do you need another one?
-I don't know. I don't know.

11:11.080 --> 11:14.860
-I don't know.
-The plant. Where is it?

11:14.960 --> 11:18.080
I can't help you
unless you tell me.

11:41.440 --> 11:44.780
Loris, where's Herb?

11:44.880 --> 11:48.660
This can't be part
of God's plan.

11:48.760 --> 11:50.800
The plant, Loris,
where is it?

11:52.320 --> 11:55.200
Please. It's for Gwen.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.360
I know. She was here.

12:25.080 --> 12:27.080
Oh, God.

12:30.040 --> 12:33.940
This doesn't make sense.
Why would she do this?

12:34.040 --> 12:36.860
She didn't. I did.

12:36.960 --> 12:38.580
Why would you do it?

12:38.680 --> 12:41.520
Because it's an abomination.

12:45.480 --> 12:48.100
Does Gwen know about it

12:48.200 --> 12:50.200
No.

13:57.160 --> 13:59.840
You sure you want to do this
now?

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Is this David Griffiths?

14:31.120 --> 14:33.120
I'll give you some time.

14:50.280 --> 14:52.820
No, things weren't good
between us.

14:52.920 --> 14:55.420
Not for a long while.

14:55.520 --> 14:58.600
There's a lot
I didn't believe him about.

15:05.280 --> 15:07.280
Do you recognise him?

15:11.760 --> 15:15.700
Did he have something
to do with...?

15:15.800 --> 15:21.040
Griffo was investigating a link
between him and this man.

15:25.120 --> 15:29.600
Did he mention anything
about either of them?

15:39.160 --> 15:42.160
You stay in here
as long as you like.

15:50.880 --> 15:53.520
Viv. What is it?

16:16.960 --> 16:18.960
Isaac.

16:20.600 --> 16:23.900
-Is this the man you saw?
-Yes.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.520
He was tied up in that chair.

16:30.040 --> 16:33.600
And Griffo was right there.

16:40.160 --> 16:42.800
I think we found
our lead suspect.

16:43.960 --> 16:47.620
We need to clear
everyone out.

17:00.600 --> 17:03.540
This is before
the Tet Offensive, of course.

17:03.640 --> 17:06.300
Our boys knew the Viet Cong
wanted Khe Sanh

17:06.400 --> 17:09.220
to give them an invasion route
in the northern provinces.

17:09.320 --> 17:12.260
That way they could outflank
US positions south of the DMZ.

17:12.360 --> 17:15.980
I can't believe you know
all this.

17:16.080 --> 17:18.380
Strangest thing.

17:18.480 --> 17:20.660
You're the dead ringer
of an old mate of mine.

17:20.760 --> 17:22.420
That right?

17:22.520 --> 17:26.400
Or might be the old mind
is playing tricks again.

17:29.360 --> 17:33.340
Oh! I haven't even offered you
a cuppa!

17:33.440 --> 17:35.140
I'll get it.

17:35.240 --> 17:39.060
-Oh. Would you mind?
-Not at all.

17:39.160 --> 17:42.480
Two sugars.

17:54.720 --> 17:57.480
My wife was a great hostess.

17:59.360 --> 18:02.020
Me, I'm hopeless.

18:02.120 --> 18:04.460
Your wife, is she...

18:04.560 --> 18:07.400
Oh, gone to God.

18:08.400 --> 18:11.100
Long time ago now.

18:11.200 --> 18:13.200
I'm sorry.

19:13.240 --> 19:16.460
Max. You're wasting your time.

19:16.560 --> 19:19.880
It's gone. Been ripped out.

19:28.320 --> 19:31.420
Where's Gwen? She rang me,
desperate for help.

19:31.520 --> 19:32.740
No, she didn't.

19:32.840 --> 19:35.180
She's fine.
She's more than fine.

20:01.760 --> 20:03.760
It's OK.

20:05.040 --> 20:07.080
It's OK.

20:08.120 --> 20:10.980
Everything's gonna be OK.

20:11.080 --> 20:13.080
I promise.

20:14.080 --> 20:16.620
I promise.

21:25.160 --> 21:26.900
Here you go, Frank.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.080
Ohhh.

21:30.680 --> 21:32.760
Thank you, son.

21:50.200 --> 21:53.040
I think this milk's a bit off.

21:57.600 --> 21:59.620
No, I think it's fine.

21:59.720 --> 22:01.940
Oh.

22:02.040 --> 22:04.800
Old tastebuds aren't
what they used to be.

22:06.880 --> 22:09.580
Nothing is.

22:09.680 --> 22:13.060
Oh, come on.
You're in great shape.

22:13.160 --> 22:15.160
Sorry...

22:15.880 --> 22:17.880
..what was your name?

22:21.800 --> 22:23.800
Herb.

22:27.080 --> 22:29.080
Herb?!

22:30.080 --> 22:32.280
No.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.240
You're kidding me!

24:22.960 --> 24:26.940
It's alright, Frank.
It's alright.

24:53.120 --> 24:57.160
It's alright, Frank.
It happened to me too.

25:04.640 --> 25:06.640
Here.

25:35.040 --> 25:37.040
Ohhh.

25:46.400 --> 25:50.300
No, I must have...
I must have hit my head.

25:50.400 --> 25:52.600
You knew it was me, didn't you?

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
When I opened the door.

25:59.160 --> 26:01.400
I could always read your face.

26:08.360 --> 26:10.360
Herb?

26:15.560 --> 26:18.940
-It's alright, Frank.

26:19.040 --> 26:21.660
It's a second chance, I guess.

26:21.760 --> 26:22.940
And I don't know how it works

26:23.040 --> 26:26.640
or whether we're imagining
the whole thing but...

26:28.720 --> 26:30.720
..we can be us again.

26:35.520 --> 26:37.520
Stop.

26:40.680 --> 26:44.460
No. I don't know what's going
on, or what you've done to me

26:44.560 --> 26:46.920
but you need to go.

26:50.040 --> 26:52.040
Get out!

26:56.200 --> 26:58.200
Get out.

27:23.080 --> 27:25.080
Herb?

27:52.360 --> 27:54.360
Herb?

27:55.920 --> 27:57.620
-What happened?
-I don't know.

27:57.720 --> 27:59.860
You right?

27:59.960 --> 28:02.460
Herb?

28:02.560 --> 28:04.560
Herb, you OK?

28:05.280 --> 28:07.280
Herb!

28:08.600 --> 28:10.100
Herb!

28:10.200 --> 28:12.200
Herb!

28:12.840 --> 28:14.840
Herb!

28:21.520 --> 28:24.100
-Herb!
-Don't come in. I'm fine.

28:24.200 --> 28:26.420
Herb.

28:26.520 --> 28:28.520
I'm sure it'll just...

28:30.240 --> 28:32.240
Herb!

28:32.840 --> 28:34.840
Don't come in!

28:38.840 --> 28:41.760
Don't come... Don't come in!

28:45.120 --> 28:49.500
How are you holding up

28:49.600 --> 28:51.840
-Alright. You right?
-Yep.

28:54.640 --> 28:56.740
Um, excuse me.

28:56.840 --> 28:58.840
Ah, that's my mum's.

29:00.680 --> 29:02.680
The necklace.

29:05.640 --> 29:07.640
Oh, um...

29:08.560 --> 29:10.560
Here.

31:02.720 --> 31:06.740
I'm sorry. They're gone.

31:06.840 --> 31:11.000
No, no, no, no.

31:30.200 --> 31:32.200
-Gwen.
-Don't!

31:49.920 --> 31:52.180
Herb?

31:54.320 --> 31:57.940
No, no, please, please
don't come in.

31:58.040 --> 31:59.300
Come on, Herb. Open the door.

31:59.400 --> 32:01.400
No, please.

32:02.240 --> 32:04.480
Herb!

32:23.760 --> 32:25.760
Hey. Hey.

32:27.880 --> 32:29.880
There you are.

33:06.960 --> 33:12.820
Isn't it funny, you know,
how the mind works

33:12.920 --> 33:14.920
in spite of itself?

33:15.920 --> 33:18.460
What do you mean?

33:18.560 --> 33:20.560
Well...

33:22.040 --> 33:26.640
..I...I tried hard
to forget you.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.980
The brief time we had together.

33:31.080 --> 33:37.060
But the harder I tried,
and the years went by...

33:37.160 --> 33:42.580
..those memories just kept
getting stronger and stronger.

33:42.680 --> 33:47.520
Blast. I'll get rid of them.

33:52.120 --> 33:55.800
-Can I help you?
-I'm looking for Frank War...

33:58.880 --> 34:02.080
-You must be his...
-His wife.

34:16.360 --> 34:19.260
L-Loris!

34:19.360 --> 34:23.120
I, er... I was...just...

34:25.200 --> 34:28.080
Your wheelchair's in the car.

35:13.640 --> 35:16.760
Shhh! Hey, kid, guess who?!

35:18.480 --> 35:20.300
Hey, my wrist. My wrist.

35:20.400 --> 35:22.820
My tat. You remember?

35:22.920 --> 35:25.860
Yeah. I'm gonna take
my hand off, alright?

35:25.960 --> 35:27.960
OK?

35:36.680 --> 35:38.680
It's...

35:40.880 --> 35:42.580
It's pretty wild, huh?

35:42.680 --> 35:47.480
You're like... You're like
the Turritopsis dohrnii.

35:49.080 --> 35:50.740
Yeah. What... What now?

35:50.840 --> 35:52.300
The immortal jellyfish.

35:52.400 --> 35:55.960
If it gets sick, it can
return back to a polyp.

35:58.560 --> 36:00.380
Yeah.

36:00.480 --> 36:02.480
It's just like that.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.080
What's that date?

36:11.120 --> 36:13.120
It's, er...

36:14.600 --> 36:16.600
..Sammy's birthday.

36:18.680 --> 36:22.340
My kid. I've got a kid.

36:22.440 --> 36:24.780
My boy.

36:24.880 --> 36:27.440
Last time I saw him
he was about your age.

36:29.280 --> 36:31.280
What happened to him?

36:33.800 --> 36:36.720
Some people just aren't
meant to be parents, you know.

36:38.920 --> 36:42.400
He looked at me like I was
a hero. I wasn't.

36:43.960 --> 36:45.960
I'm the bad guy.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.980
So...I had to cut him loose,

36:54.080 --> 36:56.420
you know, like from
a rotten leg,

36:56.520 --> 36:58.520
to save him.

37:00.360 --> 37:02.360
He, ah...

37:04.600 --> 37:07.080
A few years ago
I stopped in on him.

37:09.600 --> 37:11.660
See how he turned out, you know?

37:11.760 --> 37:13.760
It's...

37:17.400 --> 37:20.200
That morning, a car came
out of nowhere.

37:26.840 --> 37:29.080
You should never outlive
your own kid.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.120
I found this.

37:39.920 --> 37:42.420
It's Mum's.

37:42.520 --> 37:46.820
It means she's still here.
I know it.

37:46.920 --> 37:48.920
Oh, no.

37:51.600 --> 37:53.600
No, mate.

38:04.160 --> 38:06.160
Get dressed.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.660
-Get the fuck out of here!
-Max.

39:02.760 --> 39:04.020
Ray!

39:04.120 --> 39:06.120
Ray.

39:15.880 --> 39:18.080
Thank you.

39:26.240 --> 39:28.240
I'm having this baby, Ray.

39:29.840 --> 39:32.680
You've given her what she needs.
Now, get out.

39:38.920 --> 39:43.060
She's mine.
This child is mine.

39:44.360 --> 39:45.860
I'm not going, Max.

39:45.960 --> 39:48.040
Max.

39:52.040 --> 39:55.620
If you love me, then you stop.

39:55.720 --> 39:57.720
Just stop.

40:07.200 --> 40:10.220
That's good. That's good.

40:10.320 --> 40:12.340
That's good. Push.

40:12.440 --> 40:14.820
Push. Come on, come on, love.

40:16.880 --> 40:19.620
Push. It's coming.
I can see it!

40:38.880 --> 40:40.880
You want to know how I did it?

40:46.640 --> 40:48.640
It's a plant.

40:49.880 --> 40:52.400
It grows where someone died.

40:54.320 --> 40:56.320
Who died here?

41:01.320 --> 41:03.100
Come on. Come on!

41:03.200 --> 41:05.200
Push!

41:28.080 --> 41:30.080
I'm sorry, mate.

41:53.680 --> 41:55.840
Why... Why...

41:56.920 --> 41:59.120
Why isn't...

42:01.120 --> 42:03.440
Why isn't he breathing?

42:07.160 --> 42:09.240
Ray?

42:12.920 --> 42:14.920
No!
