SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.

02:59.179 --> 03:02.012
IT DOES, INDEED.

03:02.099 --> 03:04.136
YOU DIDN'T
LIKE IT, HANLEY?

03:06.144 --> 03:08.351
I'M A CHIEF ENGINEER,
MR. WHIPPLE.

03:08.438 --> 03:11.851
MY DUTIES CONSIST OF PLANT MANAGEMENT.
I'M NOT A F/L/I/I CRITIC.

LOOK, I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU TO

BUT AS PLANT MANAGER, I THOUGHT
YOU'D HA\/E A POINT OF \/IEVV

03:18.281 --> 03:22.400

YOU'D HA\/E SOME DEGREE OF ENTHUSIASM

THAT CAN'T YOU?

03:29.501 --> 03:33.119
OH, YES. IT GIVES ME
THE LAY OF THE LAND.

03:33.213 --> 03:37.958
TELL ME, DO YOU REALLY EXPECT TO
AUTOMATE THIS PLACE IN SIX MONTHS?

03:38.051 --> 03:40.634
FOUR MONTHS WOULD
BE A BETTER GUESS.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.634
THERE A LOT OF THINGS GOING IN
THE OLD TRASH HEAP, HANLEY.

03:43.724 --> 03:48.719
TIME CLOCKS, FOR INSTANOE. THERE

VVE DON'T MAKE BOOK ON THIS

BUT WE CAN TELL YOU THAT
FOR THIS PARTICULAR CONTEST,

04:57.964 --> 05:01.582
THERE IS STANDING ROOM ONLY
IN THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

YOU KNOVV VVHAT YOUR
TROUBLE IS, HANLEY?

05:24.324 --> 05:27.692
YOU'RE HOLDING ON TIGHT
TO THIS 19th CENTURY.

05:27.786 --> 05:31.074
I'M HOLDING TIGHT TO SOME
PRINCIPLES, MR. VVHIPPLE.

05:31.164 --> 05:34.247
SOME PRINCIPLES THAT
HAVE TO DO WITH FIRING.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.167
THE REGRET FOR
THE WHOLESALE FIRINGS

05:37.254 --> 05:39.916
OF MEN WHO'VE WORKED
HERE FROM 2O TO 3O YEARS.

05:40.006 --> 05:43.749
REGRET, INDEED. IT'S COME TO REGRET, HUH?
I'LL LET YOU HANDLE THE REGRETS.

05:43.844 --> 05:48.213
THAT'LL BE YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. I TELL YOU
VVHAT, HANLEY. HA\/E A SIGN MADE FOR YOUR DESK.

05:48.306 --> 05:53.142
IT'LL SAY, "MR. VVALTER HANLEY, PLANT
MANAGER IN CHARGE OF REGRETS."

05:56.106 --> 06:00.851
TELL ME, MR. VVHIPPLE, VVHY ARE YOU SO
EAGER TO REPLACE MEN VVITH MACHINES?

06:00.902 --> 06:04.190
EVER OCCUR TO YOU THAT YOU MIGHT
BE TRADING EFFICIENCY FOR PRIDE?

06:04.239 --> 06:06.401
PRIDE?

06:06.491 --> 06:10.234
YES, PRIDE! CRAFTSMANSHIP. VVHAT A
MAN FEELS VVHEN HE MAKES SOMETHING.

06:10.328 --> 06:14.617
TELL ME, VVHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT MACHINE
OF YOURS FEELS? ANYTHING? ANYTHING AT ALL?

06:14.708 --> 06:19.248
VVHAT THE DE\/IL CAN I DO VVITH PRIDE?
CAN IT, BOTTLE IT, VVRAP IT, PRODUCE IT?

06:19.337 --> 06:21.419
I'M NOT SELLING PRIDE,
I'M SELLING PRODUCT.

06:21.506 --> 06:23.042
YOUR FATHER--

06:23.133 --> 06:25.249
WHAT ABOUT MY FATHER?

06:25.343 --> 06:28.085
YOUR FATHER RAN THIS PLANT FOR 4O YEARS.
HE HAD AN EYE FOR PROFIT.

06:28.179 --> 06:30.261
NOBODY EVER ACCUSED HIM
OF INEFFICIENCY, BUT--

06:30.348 --> 06:31.759
BUT WHAT?

06:31.850 --> 06:33.682
HE HAD SOMETHING
ELSE ON HIS MIND.

06:33.768 --> 06:36.100
VVHAT ELSE DID MY FATHER HA\/E
ON HIS MIND, MR. HANLEY?

06:36.187 --> 06:39.976
GOOD VVILL. AND THE VVELFARE OF
THE PEOPLE VVHO VVORKED FOR HIM.

06:40.066 --> 06:44.481
GOOD VVILL AND THE VVELFARE OF THE
PEOPLE THAT VVORKED FOR HIM, INDEED.

06:44.571 --> 06:47.734
IN 4O YEARS, MY FATHER DOUBLED
THE SIZE OF HIS PLANT

06:47.782 --> 06:50.399
WHILE HIS COMPETITORS
QUADRUPLED THEIRS.

06:50.493 --> 06:54.282
HIS COMPETITORS, MR. HANLEY, VVHO VVERE
PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT LESS CONCERNED

06:54.372 --> 06:57.660
VVITH THE GOOD VVILL AND VVELFARE OF
THE PEOPLE THAT VVORKED FOR THEM.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.994
THEY PAID A FAIR VVAGE AND THEY GOT
A FAIR DAY'S VVORK IN EXCHANGE.

07:01.087 --> 07:05.422
BUT, IF THEY COULD FIND AMACHINE THEY COULD
PUT IN TO REPLACE A MAN, THEY DID IT.

07:05.467 --> 07:08.425
BUT PERHAPS THEY DIDN'T HA\/E
PLANT MANAGERS LIKE YOURSELF

07:08.511 --> 07:14.257
VVHO VVENT OFF INTO A CRYING JAG EVERY TIME
A PINK SLIP VVAS ATTACHED TO A TIME CLOCK.

07:15.810 --> 07:18.097
WHAT'S THE NAME
OF THE PLANT FOREMAN?

07:18.146 --> 07:21.855
DICKERSON, DICKERSON, THAT'S HIS NAME.
GET HIM UP HERE FOR ME, VVILL YOU?

07:21.942 --> 07:26.482
<i>I'M GOING TO INDULGE IN SOME OF THAT
HEARTFELT COMPASSION THAT YOU HUNGER FOR.</i>

07:26.571 --> 07:30.030
I'M GOING TO GIVE HIM AND HIS
STAFF FOUR MONTHS' NOTICE.

07:30.116 --> 07:33.199
<i>NOW, I PUT IT TO YOU, HANLEY, IS
THAT COMPASSIONATE OR ISN'T IT?</i>

07:33.286 --> 07:36.278
NOVV, YOU GO GET HIM, VVOULD YOU
PLEASE, HANLEY? GET HIM UP HERE

07:36.331 --> 07:39.449
AND HOLD HIS HAND, DRY HIS
EYES, PAT HIM ON THE HEAD,

07:39.501 --> 07:41.492
BUT GET HIM UP HERE.

07:45.090 --> 07:49.049
<i>SO, THAT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF IT, MR.
DICKERSON. YOU MAY TELL THE ENTIRE DAY SHIFT</i>

07:49.135 --> 07:51.843
THAT THEY'LL BE PINK-SLIPPED
AS OF THE FIRST OF JULY.

07:51.930 --> 07:54.388
<i>WE'RE HERE TO SET
IT UP, MR. WHIPPLE.</i>

07:54.474 --> 07:58.513
FINE, I'\/E CHECKED THE MACHINE OVER. JUST
PUT IT DOVVNSTAIRS, BUT TREAT IT GENTLY.

07:58.603 --> 08:00.310
HANDLE IT WITH CARE.

08:08.697 --> 08:11.815
NOVV, YOU REALIZE THAT THIS
SOMEVVHAT VVHOLESALE DISCHARGE

08:11.866 --> 08:16.030
HAS NOTHING WHATEVER TO DO VVITH DISSATISFAOTION
ON YOUR PART OR THAT OF THE MEN.

08:16.121 --> 08:19.159
IT'S MERELY PROGRESS,
MR. DICKERSON. PROGRESS.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.581
OUT VVITH THE OLD, IN VVITH THE NEVV.
AUTOMATION.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.784
THAT'LL BE ALL,
MR. DICKERSON.

08:25.755 --> 08:27.837
YES, MR. WHIPPLE.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.672
THAT WILL BE ALL.

08:41.730 --> 08:43.937
DID YOU EVER
NOTICE, MR. HANLEY,

08:44.024 --> 08:47.267
EVER NOTICE HOW IT
LOOKS LIKE IT HAD A FACE?

08:47.360 --> 08:50.102
AN UGLY FACE.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.688
A MISERABLE,
UGLY FACE.

08:52.741 --> 08:54.948
WHIPPLE, HE THINKS
IT'S A MACHINE.

08:55.035 --> 08:59.620
IT'S NOT A MACHINE, IT'S AN ENEMY.
IT'S AN OPPONENT.

08:59.706 --> 09:03.370
I SVVEAR, VVE'\/E GOT TO
<i>HA</i> TE A THING LIKE THIS.

09:12.761 --> 09:16.299
GETTING AVVFUL LATE, DICK. SHOULD
HA\/E CLOSED HALF AN HOUR AGO.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.630
[drunkenly] YOU KNOW
WHAT THESE ARE?

09:18.725 --> 09:20.557
PAIR OF HANDS?

09:20.602 --> 09:23.970
YEAH, PAIR OF HANDS. YOU
KNOVV VVHAT ELSE THEY ARE?

09:24.064 --> 09:26.772
THEY'RE OBSOLETE,
THEY'RE OFF THE MARKET.

09:26.858 --> 09:31.819
THEY'RE LIKE VVOODEN VVAGONS
TRYING TO ROLL DOVVN A FREEVVAY.

09:31.905 --> 09:36.615
FLESH AND BONE
AND MUSCLE AND NERVE,

09:36.701 --> 09:41.070
BUT THAT DON'T CUT
MUSTARD ANYMORE.

09:41.122 --> 09:46.834
I VVANT TO TELL YOU SOME-I'M
GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

09:46.920 --> 09:50.788
THERE <i>ISN'T</i>
A <i>MACHINE MADE</i>

09:50.882 --> 09:52.748
THAT CAN BEAT A MAN.

09:52.801 --> 09:56.089
ISN'T ONE MA--
I'LL PROVE IT TO YOU!

09:58.223 --> 10:03.093
I'M GOING OVER THERE RIGHT NOVV
AND I'M GONNA PROVE IT TO YOU.

10:03.186 --> 10:07.350
I'M GONNA TAKE THAT
NEW MACHINE OF WHIPPLE'S

10:07.440 --> 10:11.604
AND I'M GONNA TURN IT
INTO NUTS AND BOLTS.

10:11.653 --> 10:16.523
AND IF THAT SLOB VVITH THE
KEY CHAIN GETS IN MY VVAY,

10:16.616 --> 10:19.529
I'M GONNA
STRANGLE HIM WITH IT.

10:33.758 --> 10:37.342
DICKERSON! I JUST GOT A CALL FROM
THE VVATCHMAN. HE SAID YOU'RE DRUNK

10:37.428 --> 10:40.671
AND BARGED RIGHT PAST HIM
VVITHOUT PAYING ANY ATTENTION.

10:40.765 --> 10:44.303
AND HE'S RIGHT,
MR. WHIPPLE.

10:44.394 --> 10:46.977
I AM DRUNK.

10:47.021 --> 10:50.810
AND I DID BARGE RIGHT IN.

10:50.859 --> 10:55.854
I'VE WORKED HERE
FOR 30 YEARS!

10:55.947 --> 11:00.066
AND I'VE BEEN FOREMAN
FOR 17OF THEM.

11:00.160 --> 11:04.575
IN MY BOOK, THAT GIVES ME
SOME RIGHTS, MR. VVHIPPLE.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.201
<i>WELL, YOU'VE GOT THE
WRONG BOOK, DKZKERSON.</i>

11:07.292 --> 11:09.750
MY BOOK READS AS FOLLOWS:
YOU'RE DRUNK, DISORDERLY

11:09.836 --> 11:13.420
AND TRESPASSING ON PRIVATE PROPERTY
AND THEREFORE SUBJECT TO ARREST.

11:13.506 --> 11:16.840
TELL ME SOMETHING,
MR. WHIPPLE.

11:16.885 --> 11:22.096
VVHEN YOU'RE DEAD AND BURIED,
VVHO DO YOU GET TO MOURN FOR YOU?

11:22.182 --> 11:26.016
SHALL I TELL YOU THE DIFFERENCE, MR.
DICKERSON, BETVVEEN YOU AND IT?

11:26.060 --> 11:30.099
THAT MACHINE COSTS TVVO CENTS AN HOUR
FOR CURRENT. IT LASTS INDEFINITELY.

11:30.190 --> 11:33.854
IT GETS NO VVRINKLES, NO ARTHRITIS,
NO HARDENING OF THE ARTERIES.

11:33.943 --> 11:37.527
THAT ONE MACHINE IS A LATHE
OPERATOR, A PRESS OPERATOR.

11:37.572 --> 11:41.190
TWO OF THOSE MACHINES
REPLACE 114 MEN

11:41.284 --> 11:45.744
THAT TAKE NO COFFEE BREAKS, NO SICK
LEAVES, NO VACATIONS VVITH PAY.

11:45.830 --> 11:48.868
AND THAT, IN MY BOOK,
MR. DICKERSON,

11:48.917 --> 11:52.000
IS WORTH CONSIDERABLY
MORE THAN YOU ARE.

11:55.173 --> 11:59.963
THEY SHOULD HAVE
STOPPED YOU A YEAR AGO!

12:01.638 --> 12:05.552
SOMEBODY OUGHT
TO HELD YOU DOWN

12:05.642 --> 12:08.384
AND PUT A BIT
IN YOUR HEAD

12:08.436 --> 12:10.973
AND POURED IN
SOME REMINDERS

12:11.064 --> 12:14.898
THAT MEN HAVE
TO EAT AND WORK.

12:14.943 --> 12:19.813
AND YOU CAN'T PACK THEM IN
COSMOLINE LIKE SURPLUS TANKS!

12:19.906 --> 12:23.740
OR PUT THEM OUT TO
PASTURE LIKE OLD BULLS!

12:23.785 --> 12:27.653
<i>I'M A MAN,
MR. WHIPPLE!</i>

12:27.747 --> 12:30.239
<i>YOU HEAR ME?
I'M A MAN!</i>

12:30.291 --> 12:34.285
AND THAT MAKES ME
BETTER THAN THAT

12:35.755 --> 12:38.417
HUNK OF METAL,
YOU HEAR ME?

12:38.466 --> 12:40.628
BETTER!

12:46.057 --> 12:47.843
WHAT SHOULD I DO
MR, WHIPPLE?

12:47.934 --> 12:49.595
STOP HIM,
STOP HIM!

12:49.644 --> 12:50.930
HE HAS A CROW BAR!

12:50.979 --> 12:52.435
I DON'T CARE!

12:52.522 --> 12:54.684
NO, YOU CAN'T DO
THAT, MR. WHIPPLE.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.981
<i>[two gunshots]</i>

13:04.784 --> 13:06.775
YOU SEE, MACHINE?

13:08.705 --> 13:14.121
LT...TOOK MORE THAN
YOU TO BEAT ME.

13:15.878 --> 13:19.621
LT...lT TOOK A MAN.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.811
OH, HANLEY, I'VE
BEEN EXPECTING YOU.

13:42.864 --> 13:44.354
NO DOUBT.

13:44.449 --> 13:47.987
THEY TOLD ME YOU
WERE AT THE HOSPITAL.

13:48.036 --> 13:51.495
I JUST CAME
FROM THE HOSPITAL.

13:51.539 --> 13:54.577
FORTUNATELY FOR YOU, MR. VVHIPPLE,
DICKERSON'S GONNA Ll\/E.

13:54.667 --> 13:59.161
FORTUNATELY FOR ME OTHER THAN PROTECTING MY
PROPERTY I HAVE NO INVOLVEMENT IN THAT AT ALL.

13:59.213 --> 14:02.877
ARE THE, UH, TECHNICIANS
DOVVNSTAIRS?

14:02.967 --> 14:07.507
HENLEY, I ASKED YOU A QUESTION. ARE THE
TECHNICIANS REPAIRING THAT MACHINE DCVVNSTAIRS?

14:07.555 --> 14:09.421
IT APPEARS SO.

14:09.515 --> 14:12.678
AH, GOOD. GOOD. OH, HANLEY,
THIS SHOULD INTEREST YOU.

14:12.727 --> 14:18.018
THIS IS A TAPE-CONTROLLED SEVEN AXIS.
VVHAT DO THEY CALL IT? A SENTRY.

14:18.066 --> 14:23.277
YOU KNOVV VVHAT IT DOES? IT KEEPS AN EYE
ON EVERY OPERATION IN THE ENTIRE PLANT.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.900
IT KEEPS ABSOLUTELY
ACCURATE DATA

14:25.990 --> 14:30.029
ON MAN HOURS, COST HOURS, PRODUCT
REJECTS, JUST EVERYTHING!

14:30.119 --> 14:33.828
IT'S THE MOST SOPHISTICATED MACHINE
I'\/E EVER SEEN. I-l JUST BOUGHT IT.

14:38.503 --> 14:41.416
AND HOW MANY MEN
DOES IT REPLACE?

14:41.506 --> 14:45.295
OH, VVELL, THIS SHOULD PLEASE YOU.
ONLY ONE, JUST ONE!

14:45.385 --> 14:48.002
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
HANLEY, IT REPLACES YOU.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.718
WELL, THAT'S ONLY
RIGHT, MR. WHIPPLE,

14:55.770 --> 14:58.432
SINCE THE POINT OF MY COMING HERE
TODAY VVAS TO GIVE YOU MY NOTICE.

14:58.523 --> 15:03.142
OH, GOOD, GOOD. I, UH,
I SUSPEOTED AS MUCH.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.568
YOU'RE A SENSIBLE
MAN, HANLEY,

15:05.613 --> 15:10.323
AND I'M SURE YOU KNOVV THAT AN INDUSTRIAL
TEAM HAS TO BE A COMPATIBLE TEAM.

15:10.410 --> 15:13.448
<i>AND WHEN TWO MEN, WELL, WHEN THEY
RUB EACH OTHER THE WRONG WAY,</i>

15:13.538 --> 15:17.497
VVELL, IT'S UNREALISTIC AND IMPRACTICAL
THAT THEY TRY TO STAY ON THE SAME TEAM.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.120
IN SPITE OF THE FACT YOU
THINK I'M KIND OF AN OGRE,

15:20.211 --> 15:22.077
SOME SORT OF A
HEARTLESS SCROOGE,

15:22.130 --> 15:24.667
I'M NOT GOING TO FORGET THE
MANY YEARS OF HARD VVORK

15:24.757 --> 15:26.839
YOU PUT IN HERE
FOR ME AND MY FATHER.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.918
I'M GOING TO SEE THAT YOU GET AN
EXTREMELY LIBERAL SEVERANCE PAY

15:30.012 --> 15:33.425
AND VVHAT I'M SURE YOU'LL AGREE IS
A FAR BETTER THAN AVERAGE PENSION.

15:33.474 --> 15:35.932
THAT'S VERY GENEROUS
OF YOU, MR. WHIPPLE.

15:36.018 --> 15:38.931
THERE'S SOMETHING I'D LIKE TO
GIVE YOU, IF YOU DON'T MIND.

15:38.980 --> 15:40.846
NO, WHAT IS THAT?

15:40.940 --> 15:43.602
THAT'S FOR YOU, MR.
VVHIPPLE, FROM ME.

15:43.651 --> 15:46.689
FOR YOUR LACK OF SENSITIVITY,
YOUR LACK OF OOMPASSION.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.191
YOUR HEARTLESS MANIPULATION
OF MEN AND METALS.

15:49.282 --> 15:52.195
YOU CAN TAKE MY SEVERANCE
PAY, MY PENSION,

15:52.285 --> 15:55.619
AND YOUR GOODBYE SPEECHES AND
FEED THEM INTO YOUR MACHINE-

15:55.663 --> 15:59.452
BECAUSE VVHEN I VVALK AVVAY
FROM YOU, I VVALK AVVAY CLEAN-

15:59.500 --> 16:02.083
AND THAT, MR. WHIPPLE,
IS ONE HELL OF A TRICK!

16:08.092 --> 16:10.049
A NEW WATCHMAN DEVICE.

16:10.136 --> 16:13.128
TAKE OUT YOUR I.D. CARD AND
HOLD IT IN FRONT OF THE DOOR.

16:13.222 --> 16:16.055
THERE ARE BUILT-IN
ELECTRIC EYES.

16:47.381 --> 16:49.088
YES, MR. WHIPPLE?

16:49.175 --> 16:52.338
OH, RUN A CONTROL
CHECK, PLEASE.

16:52.428 --> 16:54.886
L'\/E ALREADY DONE IT, MR.
VVHIPPLE, TVVO HOURS AGO.

16:54.972 --> 16:57.430
I DID IT RIGHT AFTER LUNCH, TOO.
AND IF YOU RECALL, SIR,

16:57.517 --> 16:59.849
I DID IT JUST AFTER YOU CAME
IN THIS MORNING AS VVELL.

16:59.894 --> 17:02.226
HAVE YOU NEVER HEARD OF
PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE?

17:02.313 --> 17:05.431
IT'S MY JOB, MR. VVHIPPLE. BUT VVHAT
YOU'RE ASKING ME TO DO ISN'T MAINTENANCE.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.892
IT'S NOT
PREVENTING A THING.

17:07.984 --> 17:11.272
INDEED. I SUPPOSE YOU KNOVV WHAT'S NEEDED
IN THIS PLANT AND VVHAT ISN'T NEEDED.

17:11.364 --> 17:14.527
I KNOVV THAT RUNNING EQUIPMENT CHECKS
TEN TIMES A DAY IS A VVASTE OF TIME,

17:14.575 --> 17:18.113
A VVASTE OF EFFORT, AND IT'S GETTING
TO BE AN IDIOTIC RITUAL AROUND HERE.

17:18.204 --> 17:22.198
YOUNG MAN, YOUR PRESENCE HERE
IS A NEOESSITY OF THE MOMENT.

17:22.290 --> 17:24.202

"OF THE MOMENT."

17:24.252 --> 17:26.710
UH, A CASE IN POINT.

NOW, STAY HERE,
OBSERVE THIS.

17:34.053 --> 17:38.047
DEAR SIR, YOURS OF THE 14TH

KNOVV VVHAT ELSE IT MEANS?

18:05.459 --> 18:08.747
IT MEANS THERE'LL BE NO MORE POVVDER

18:08.796 --> 18:11.413
NO MORE VVORK STOPPAGES DUE
TO SUNDRY INCONVENIENCES

18:11.507 --> 18:13.748
SUCH AS MATERNITY
AND THAT SORT OF THING.

18:13.801 --> 18:18.136
INCONVENIENCES LIKE MATERNITY? YOU'LL
HA\/E TO FORGIVE ME, MR. VVHIPPLE,

18:18.222 --> 18:21.840
BUT IF VVE KEEP UP VVITH THIS SORT OF THING,
VVE'RE GONNA HA\/E WONDERFUL PRODUCTS

18:21.934 --> 18:23.766
BUT MIGHTY FEW
PEOPLE TO BUY THEM.

18:23.811 --> 18:26.519
HAPPILY THAT IS
NOT MY CONCERN.

18:26.606 --> 18:30.474
I AM HERE TO PROVIDE EFFICIENCY.
THAT IS MY ONLY CONCERN.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.948
MR. VVHIPPLE? HA\/E YOU LOOKED
AROUND THIS PLACE LATELY?

18:37.992 --> 18:39.608
LOOKED AROUND?

18:39.660 --> 18:41.992
THE CAFETERIA,
FOR EXAMPLE.

18:42.079 --> 18:44.867
IT'S LIKE A CAVE.
NOT A SOUL IN THERE.

18:44.957 --> 18:49.121
JUST A FEVV VENDING MACHINES AND
MUSIC COMING THROUGH A LOUDSPEAKER.

18:49.170 --> 18:51.377

18:51.464 --> 18:54.627

THIS PLACE HAS EVERYTHING NCVV

18:59.263 --> 19:00.674

WHAT IT LACKS?

19:00.765 --> 19:03.006
NO, TELL ME.

19:03.100 --> 19:06.638
VOICES. LAUGHTER. JUST WHATEVER IT
IS THAT MAKE PEOPLE FEEL FOR PEOPLE.

19:06.729 --> 19:10.893
THAT'S VVHAT IT LACKS. THIS IS A LOUSY

19:10.983 --> 19:14.476
THEN I'LL SPARE YOU ANY FURTHER SUFFERING.
YOU'RE DISCHARGED.

19:18.324 --> 19:20.907
NO, I CAN'T WORK
HERE ANYMORE.

19:20.993 --> 19:23.234
IT'S TOO DARN LONELY.

19:27.083 --> 19:29.370

QUITE RIGHT, YOU KNOW.

22:54.540 --> 22:58.374

22:58.460 --> 23:01.418
