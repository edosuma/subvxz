message, I just...

01:53.080 --> 01:55.080
Do you know what stage?

01:55.082 --> 01:57.583
Is there...

02:00.087 --> 02:03.021
Well is there, is there
a biopsy or not a biopsy?

02:09.497 --> 02:10.496
Okay, uh.

02:12.633 --> 02:17.703
Alright, I just,
okay I can't...

02:19.106 --> 02:20.839
No I understand what
you're saying, I just...

02:25.613 --> 02:26.912
No I haven't talked to--

02:26.914 --> 02:29.214
- Hey idiot, hang up
the phone and drive!

02:31.986 --> 02:35.687
- Are you kidding me?

02:36.790 --> 02:37.756
Hey!

02:37.758 --> 02:39.091
- Lady--

02:39.093 --> 02:40.325
- How did that feel?
- Alright, alright,

02:40.327 --> 02:41.627
lady why don't
you just go back--

02:41.629 --> 02:42.694
- No, no, no, no,
how did it feel

02:42.696 --> 02:45.597
to drive like a douche
bag, cut off somebody

02:45.599 --> 02:47.833
and flip off a
mom in a mini van.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.701
That feel good to you?
- Yeah, nice and cathartic,

02:49.703 --> 02:51.870
real cathartic for me, yeah.
- Oh, good, good, good.

02:51.872 --> 02:53.605
I'm glad we could
work that out for you.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.974
- Alright now go back
to the PTA meeting,

02:55.976 --> 02:58.644
go back, no one cares--
- I'm not on the PTA!

02:58.646 --> 03:00.212
I'm not even on Booster!

03:00.214 --> 03:01.680
I used to be punk rock
- We're done,

03:01.682 --> 03:03.615
bye.
- Mr. Shitty, shit,

03:03.617 --> 03:06.385
shitter, shitty shit ass.
- Goodbye, goodbye.

03:06.387 --> 03:09.121
- Bag of shit, fart sniffing.
- Goodbye, goodbye.

03:09.123 --> 03:11.256
- No, not today, not today.

03:13.727 --> 03:14.593
- What?

03:15.896 --> 03:17.829
Hey, get--
- Today's the day

03:17.831 --> 03:20.299

03:20.301 --> 03:23.368
You don't get to treat
people like crap anymore!

03:23.370 --> 03:24.636
- Uh ma'am, excuse me.

03:24.638 --> 03:25.704
- What! What!

03:25.706 --> 03:27.873
- Are you alright?

03:27.875 --> 03:29.708
Do you need anything?

03:29.710 --> 03:33.312
- No, Mr. Helper, I'm
not actually alright.

03:33.314 --> 03:35.981
I happen to have cancer again!

03:36.717 --> 03:38.750
Cancer!
- Shit.

03:38.752 --> 03:42.554
- Stop hurting
people's feelings.

03:43.924 --> 03:44.790
Look out!

03:46.493 --> 03:47.326
I'm fine.

- Hi, guys.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.648
- Max, stop it.

04:44.084 --> 04:44.950
Max!

04:46.720 --> 04:48.220
Stop it, Max.
- Mom.

04:49.156 --> 04:50.789
- Mom.

04:50.791 --> 04:51.990
You're stupid.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.458
- You're stupid.
- Are you leaving or staying?

04:53.460 --> 04:54.326
Hello?

04:55.796 --> 04:57.996
Excuse me, I said are you
leaving or are you staying?

04:59.300 --> 05:02.634
- You need to shut the fuck up.

05:02.636 --> 05:03.735
- Mom!

05:04.838 --> 05:05.937
- Mom,
that's a bad word.

05:05.939 --> 05:06.972
That's like five bucks.
- That's the worst one.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.307
- I know, I know.

05:39.673 --> 05:40.772
- Hi.
- What's up?

05:40.774 --> 05:42.441
- What's up?
- How you doing?

05:44.044 --> 05:45.043
Good day at school?

05:46.146 --> 05:48.447
- Hey Dad.
- Hi, how are you?

05:48.449 --> 05:50.148
- Good.
- How was your day, good?

05:50.150 --> 05:52.184
Good, ah, no, mine.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.853
What's up, how was your day?

05:54.855 --> 05:58.190
- Good but Nikki's party's
on the same day as my party

05:58.192 --> 06:00.859
and Nikki says everybody's
gonna go to her party

06:00.861 --> 06:02.728
and nobody's gonna
go to my party,

06:02.730 --> 06:04.896
and Nikki says I
smell like old soup.

06:04.898 --> 06:07.799
- You don't smell like old soup
and Nikki's an idiot, okay?

06:07.801 --> 06:08.633
I love you.

06:09.470 --> 06:11.036
- Hey, there's my Ozzie!

06:11.038 --> 06:12.704
- Oh honey, no
not with the Ozzie.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.740
- No, no, don't honey please.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.041
Please don't, just
don't turn him on.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.509
Don't turn him on.
- Yeah just mute it.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.878
Don't turn them on.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.814
- You okay?

06:22.816 --> 06:25.384
- Uh, your mom, your mom called.

06:25.386 --> 06:27.753
- Okay.

06:27.755 --> 06:30.288
- She called and
you should call her.

06:32.659 --> 06:35.761
And I need a handle on
the door of the garage.

06:35.763 --> 06:39.131
I can't close it without a
handle, I don't have a handle.

06:40.768 --> 06:42.334
- Okay.

06:42.336 --> 06:43.835
Guys, please!

06:43.837 --> 06:45.103
Enough, the Ozzies inside.

06:46.006 --> 06:46.838
Jesus.

06:47.875 --> 06:48.740
- It's back.

06:50.444 --> 06:51.543
- What?

06:51.545 --> 06:52.477
What's back?

06:54.281 --> 06:55.147
- Cancer.

06:56.216 --> 06:57.082
Recurrence.

06:59.453 --> 07:00.919
Left breast this time.

07:01.955 --> 07:04.055
- How?

07:13.133 --> 07:14.433
You guys okay?

07:17.938 --> 07:18.804
Babe?

07:20.908 --> 07:21.773
Hey babe?

07:31.919 --> 07:34.453
- These floorboards
are disgusting.

07:39.927 --> 07:44.463
Like, crazy mold, dirty, spores.

07:47.634 --> 07:48.500
- Hey, hon?

07:49.937 --> 07:52.504
The phone, the doctor.

07:53.941 --> 07:54.840
Do you want to talk?

07:57.444 --> 07:59.978
I am using dulcet
tones in order to

07:59.980 --> 08:03.081
soothe you away from
your OCD psychotic break.

08:08.822 --> 08:09.988
- That was Dad's neighbor.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.356
He met her a thousand times.

08:11.358 --> 08:14.159
- Was it perfume lady or
the clickety clack teeth?

08:14.161 --> 08:15.527
- The teeth.

08:15.529 --> 08:18.997
Yeah she said Dad's
been gone all night.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.266
He left around four a.m.
and his door's open.

08:22.102 --> 08:23.268
Where are my keys?

08:23.270 --> 08:24.169
- I don't know.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.103
- Of course you don't know.

08:25.105 --> 08:27.806
But maybe if you

08:27.808 --> 08:30.709
maybe looked left or right
and helped me find them.

08:37.683 --> 08:41.385
Why are you putting hands on
me like a creepy spa attendant?

08:43.823 --> 08:45.290
- These are my dulcet hands.

08:47.127 --> 08:49.895
I'm trying to soothe
you with dulcet hands.

08:51.832 --> 08:52.864
- I have to go find him.

08:52.866 --> 08:53.965
- Nope, I've got it, okay?

08:53.967 --> 08:56.401
- No, no, no, no, I
know all his places.

08:56.403 --> 08:59.538
And you have to get
Scout's cake, okay?

08:59.540 --> 09:01.640
And no princesses, okay?

09:01.642 --> 09:04.042
She's already furious enough
without being relegated

09:04.044 --> 09:06.044
to some female stereotype.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.879
You might wanna pass
that on to your mom

09:07.881 --> 09:10.048
with her makeup and
the heels and all that.

09:14.588 --> 09:15.887
- Babe, babe, cake?

09:15.889 --> 09:17.255
- Oh, cake, um.

09:18.825 --> 09:21.860
In the book there are
pictures, just flip through.

09:21.862 --> 09:24.396
Point to the picture that
you want and order that

09:24.398 --> 09:27.699
but only order it
from Josh, the chef.

09:27.701 --> 09:29.067
- Josh.
- The chef.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.201
The chef.
- Chef.

09:30.203 --> 09:31.937
- Josh, yes.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.772
- No princesses.

09:34.575 --> 09:35.507
- You're it.

09:35.509 --> 09:36.708
Can you clean up around here?

09:36.710 --> 09:37.609
It's just looking a little--

09:37.611 --> 09:38.543
- Wait, seriously what's up?

09:38.545 --> 09:40.178
How are you? What's going on?

09:41.014 --> 09:41.913
- I gotta go get Dad.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.548
I don't know, I don't know.

09:43.550 --> 09:47.319
I'm kind of shocky right
now so I'm going with it.

09:48.121 --> 09:49.788
I'm worried about Dad.

09:49.790 --> 09:52.023
He's worse every day, he's
wandering, he's repeating.

09:53.460 --> 09:58.430
And the boobs, here we go
again, freakin' Groundhog Day.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.031
- You owe me a dollar.

10:00.033 --> 10:01.700
- Oh, freakin' doesn't count.

10:03.704 --> 10:04.469
You're it.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.117
- Yeah, it, it has,

10:52.119 --> 10:53.118
it's been about three
months since that invoice.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.452
If you could get that out to me,

10:54.454 --> 10:56.087
I'd really, really
appreciate it, okay?

10:56.957 --> 10:58.323
Guys, really, really?

10:58.325 --> 11:00.859
Just, you're gonna get me
arrested with all this water.

11:01.695 --> 11:02.994
Hey Jim!

11:02.996 --> 11:05.163
Yeah, it's true.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.364
How are you?

11:06.366 --> 11:08.433
Pay me.

11:08.435 --> 11:11.336
I'm kidding, not
really, I mean...

11:11.338 --> 11:14.673
Yeah if you could, uh, you could
send a check sometime soon.

11:14.675 --> 11:16.107
I was just joking
around but I do kind of

11:16.109 --> 11:17.676
need you to send that,
it's been a few months.

11:17.678 --> 11:20.145
Guys really, just try to
get some soap on the car.

11:20.147 --> 11:23.181
I like the whole thing,
no not you, I'm watching,

11:23.183 --> 11:24.616
I'm at a car wash.

11:24.618 --> 11:25.450
Okay, thanks.

11:27.954 --> 11:32.057
You guys are the worst
car washers in the world.

11:39.533 --> 11:40.899
- Jesus Christ.

11:46.139 --> 11:48.807
Pop.

11:52.179 --> 11:53.044
Hey.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.314
You okay? It's me.

11:56.316 --> 11:58.049
- Oh hi.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.584
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:59.586 --> 12:00.385
- Hi.

12:04.257 --> 12:05.724
Buckle up, safety.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.094
- This car is quiet,

12:09.096 --> 12:11.563
this is great,
this is fantastic.

12:11.565 --> 12:13.198
- Alright, you good?

12:13.200 --> 12:15.100
- Yeah, it's
good to see you.

12:17.504 --> 12:20.171
- It's good to see you
too, Pop, let's go home.

12:20.173 --> 12:21.072
- Where are we going?

12:21.074 --> 12:22.574
- Home.

12:22.576 --> 12:23.441
- Okay.

12:23.443 --> 12:25.176
- What's that?

12:25.178 --> 12:26.945
Mm-hmm.

12:26.947 --> 12:30.749
Yeah, buddy you gotta reduce
the fractions there and there.

12:30.751 --> 12:32.117
- No, no, that's not
the way he's telling us

12:32.119 --> 12:33.251
because he says we have to--
- I'm on the phone,

12:33.253 --> 12:34.185
I'm on the phone, on the phone.

12:34.187 --> 12:35.787
- Well you're doing it wrong.

12:35.789 --> 12:36.788
- Tell me something
I don't know.

12:36.790 --> 12:37.922
- Tone.

12:37.924 --> 12:39.691
- Really?
- Max, stop being a cop.

12:40.794 --> 12:43.228
- No, yeah I
understand, I get it.

12:43.230 --> 12:47.198
Just in the future if there's
any other work that you had,

12:47.200 --> 12:51.936
I would be open to, can you
hold on just one second pl-,

12:51.938 --> 12:52.804
Hello?

12:55.375 --> 12:56.541
Hey, babe?

12:57.477 --> 12:58.810
- Oh my god, this place hon,

12:58.812 --> 13:00.478
it's like Three Gardens
meets Martha Stewart.

13:01.581 --> 13:05.550
No, it's really
bad, it's horrible.

13:05.552 --> 13:07.285
Oh, no.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.186
These are bills.

13:09.489 --> 13:13.191
These are all bills,
these are bills.

13:14.661 --> 13:16.227
How long have you had these?

13:21.234 --> 13:23.334
Oh, god.

13:23.336 --> 13:26.271

Fine, I'll call Paula.

13:56.102 --> 13:57.435
- Dad?

13:57.437 --> 13:59.604
- Hey, I'm good, I'm
good, don't worry.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.975
- If I'm done,
can I play guitar?

14:03.977 --> 14:07.345
- Yeah.

14:18.291 --> 14:19.090
- What?

14:19.860 --> 14:21.326
- I gotta go on an errand, okay?

14:21.328 --> 14:23.361
Are you okay with Auntie
Paula coming over?

14:23.363 --> 14:26.030
- Yeah, she paints my
nails and talks about boys.

14:27.234 --> 14:30.501
- You do know that Auntie Paula
is not your real aunt right?

14:30.503 --> 14:33.304
- Yeah, she's Mommy's
bestie after you.

14:33.306 --> 14:36.341
- You also know that
she's crazy, right?

14:36.343 --> 14:39.177
- She says you have
issues, what's that?

14:39.179 --> 14:41.412
- Well that's something I'm
gonna talk to her about later.

14:41.414 --> 14:43.314
Hey, are you the smartest
girl in the world?

14:43.316 --> 14:44.582
- Says you.

14:44.584 --> 14:45.717
- And do
boys think you ruin

14:45.719 --> 14:46.551
all your stuffed animals?

14:46.553 --> 14:48.219
- Says you.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.053
- I love you.

14:49.055 --> 14:49.921
- I love you.

14:56.396 --> 14:57.662

14:57.664 --> 14:59.230
Did you hear there was
a one dollar special

14:59.232 --> 15:00.265
on well drinks here?

15:00.267 --> 15:02.066
- Oh hey, captain tool.

15:02.068 --> 15:04.903
I live two doors down, I
could be here in a heartbeat.

15:04.905 --> 15:06.437
How is she?

15:06.439 --> 15:09.674
- She's Bailey, she's excellent.

15:09.676 --> 15:12.443
- Yeah I know, she barely
could get a sentence out

15:12.445 --> 15:15.446
on the phone between all the
ice munching so, not okay.

15:16.349 --> 15:17.415
You know that right?

15:17.417 --> 15:19.017
- Yes I know that.

15:19.019 --> 15:22.287
Like I know about the auto
renewal on your Eharmony account.

15:22.289 --> 15:23.288
Don't kill my kids.

15:23.290 --> 15:24.989
- Try not to screw
up everything.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.092
Scoutie.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.360
- Hi, Paula.

15:29.362 --> 15:32.196
- I brought lip gloss
and my old retainer.

15:32.198 --> 15:33.364
- Is that good or bad?

15:38.638 --> 15:39.938
- You gotta
be kidding me.

15:45.578 --> 15:47.278
- Uh, excuse me.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.147
We're waiting here.

15:49.149 --> 15:51.416
You can't cut the line.
- No cuts.

15:51.418 --> 15:52.283
- I'm just...

15:52.285 --> 15:54.118
So this is, this is the line?

15:54.120 --> 15:56.254
This is the line to get a cake?

15:56.256 --> 15:57.288
- Yeah.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.390
- It is, and the

16:18.979 --> 16:21.312
No, no, no, no, no, don't do it.

16:21.314 --> 16:22.814
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

16:22.816 --> 16:25.083
- But this is the line
for the fancy cake?

16:25.085 --> 16:26.584
- Yeah, this is the
line for the cakes.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.252
Careful, you do not want to cut,

16:28.254 --> 16:30.288
they're crazy about cuts, okay?

16:30.290 --> 16:33.091
- Okay, but this is the

Penelope Power Princess cake

16:43.536 --> 16:45.903

this place, um...

16:47.640 --> 16:48.439

16:50.110 --> 16:51.542
I read that he's the
best for these cakes.

16:51.544 --> 16:53.211
- Yeah?

16:53.213 --> 16:55.446
- My mom and me, we've
been saving money

16:55.448 --> 16:57.815
for months to buy her cake.

16:57.817 --> 16:59.117
She's gonna be so happy.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.552

21:40.667 --> 21:41.999
You okay? Kids asleep?

21:42.001 --> 21:43.901

21:46.105 --> 21:47.672
- How are you?

21:47.674 --> 21:50.775
- I'm
totally checked out

21:50.777 --> 21:53.811
but Vicodin is neat,
and so is that.

21:54.781 --> 21:57.615
- Mm, okay I got dinner.

21:57.617 --> 21:58.849
What do you want, I can--

21:58.851 --> 22:01.252
- Already handled, I made stew.

22:01.254 --> 22:03.854
Mommy and shorties
are all happy and fed.

22:03.856 --> 22:06.157
And there's some
leftovers for you.

22:06.159 --> 22:08.826
I didn't keep it hot
because I didn't know

22:08.828 --> 22:11.028
what time you'd get home, so.

22:11.030 --> 22:12.697
- Well it smells
incredible Paula.

22:12.699 --> 22:15.266
Did you brew this up in your
passive aggressive cauldron?

22:16.769 --> 22:18.869
- Hey did you um...

22:18.871 --> 22:20.104
- I did.

22:20.106 --> 22:21.872
- And Josh
understood everything?

22:21.874 --> 22:22.940
- Mm-hmm.

22:22.942 --> 22:26.310
- Hon, you spoke to
Josh directly, right?

22:26.312 --> 22:28.646
- Sure, kind of.

22:28.648 --> 22:30.181
- Oh.

22:30.183 --> 22:31.849
I told you, remember I
told you specifically,

22:31.851 --> 22:33.584
talk to Josh directly?

22:34.787 --> 22:36.554
Remember when I
said specifically--

22:36.556 --> 22:39.990
- I went there and I ordered
it from Josh's assistant

22:39.992 --> 22:43.327
and he took the order and
it's great and it's fine

22:43.329 --> 22:44.628
and he said it's
gonna be perfect.

22:44.630 --> 22:46.063
- Oh no Drew, I told
you, I told you--

22:46.065 --> 22:48.632
- Will you just
trust me, please?

22:51.971 --> 22:53.104
- Fine.

22:53.740 --> 22:54.872
Fine.

23:01.214 --> 23:02.913
- Seriously? That's it?

23:04.384 --> 23:06.217
That is a lame fight.

23:06.219 --> 23:08.719
- Before I forget, how is the
dating scene treating you?

23:08.721 --> 23:11.922
- You are
a bad, mean man.

23:11.924 --> 23:14.225
Can you get me some ice?

23:14.227 --> 23:18.529

23:18.531 --> 23:21.665

and has a real job.

23:21.667 --> 23:22.400
Thank you.

23:22.402 --> 23:23.401
- So, ancient.

23:24.771 --> 23:26.003
- Mature.

23:26.005 --> 23:28.172
- You know what honey,
he sounds great.

23:28.174 --> 23:31.709
He sounds great, don't you
play along with him, okay?

23:31.711 --> 23:34.445
Could you maybe get me some ice?

23:34.447 --> 23:36.113
- I will call you
in the morning.

23:37.850 --> 23:41.185
I love you, you gorgeous
obviously blind midget.

23:41.187 --> 23:43.554
You call me if
you need anything.

23:43.556 --> 23:46.223
Good night, you giant
strapping hemorrhoid.

23:46.225 --> 23:48.225
- Honestly Paula,
thank you so much

23:48.227 --> 23:49.860
for taking care of her for me.

23:49.862 --> 23:51.095
- I always do.

23:51.097 --> 23:52.930
- Oh also, before I forget.

23:52.932 --> 23:55.966
What kind of women over the
age of 40 gets the clap anyway?

23:56.869 --> 23:59.003
- Oh my god.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.774
- It was a bladder infection.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.609
And could you, you,

24:05.611 --> 24:08.646
You possibly one
time not tell him

24:08.648 --> 24:10.881
everything that I tell you.

24:10.883 --> 24:12.116
- I'm an idiot.

24:12.118 --> 24:13.784
- Yeah but you're entertaining

24:13.786 --> 24:15.719
and you have really
pretty kids so

24:16.589 --> 24:18.022
I forgive you, I love you.

24:18.891 --> 24:19.990
- Love you.

24:20.993 --> 24:21.859

Hey.

How are you?

24:28.901 --> 24:30.334
For real, I mean you okay?

24:33.773 --> 24:36.941
Hon, we need to kind of
talk about this stuff.

24:36.943 --> 24:40.010
- Can I just postpone
all the feeling stuff

24:40.012 --> 24:44.281
and give you all these
lists and tasks and duties?

24:44.283 --> 24:45.416
- You said duties.

24:45.418 --> 24:46.851
- Okay, moving on.

24:47.987 --> 24:51.255
So listen I'm about to get
hijacked by all this doctor crap

24:51.257 --> 24:54.925

tomorrow, maybe Thursday,

24:54.927 --> 24:57.962

take care of all this?

24:57.964 --> 24:58.996
- Okay here's the thing.

24:58.998 --> 25:01.031
I was lining up work
for the next few days

25:01.033 --> 25:03.000
and I was just thinking that...

25:04.136 --> 25:05.002
Never mind.

25:07.340 --> 25:09.540
- You're gonna work
my cancer away.

25:09.542 --> 25:12.109
- No, no, I mean maybe.

25:15.214 --> 25:16.113
I, I...

25:16.114 --> 25:17.013
Do you remember the
bills last time?

25:17.016 --> 25:17.882
- Yeah.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.387
- Forget I even said that.
- Okay, yeah.

25:23.389 --> 25:26.190
I need you, this is
where I need you.

25:26.192 --> 25:28.659
You are serving a
greater purpose.

25:28.661 --> 25:32.296
You are helping me and
the universe, okay?

25:32.298 --> 25:35.065
Please just please? Please?

25:35.067 --> 25:36.233
- Yes.

25:36.235 --> 25:37.535
- Okay good.

25:37.537 --> 25:40.070
I still have to hire
a live-in for Dad

25:40.072 --> 25:44.308
and we still have to book
Popo, get the decorations,

25:44.310 --> 25:46.410
there's a cake maybe.
- I did that.

25:46.412 --> 25:49.547
- Okay, maybe a backup or two.

25:50.983 --> 25:53.984
Not to mention everything
around here like the cleaning

25:53.986 --> 25:56.387
and the shopping
and the laundry.

25:56.389 --> 25:58.055
- Hey wait a second,
who's Poopoo?

25:58.057 --> 25:59.757
- Popo, the puppy wrangler.

25:59.759 --> 26:00.524
- What?

26:00.526 --> 26:02.660
Puppies, why?

26:02.662 --> 26:05.195
- It's what Scout wanted, we
talked about this, I told you.

26:05.197 --> 26:06.997
- No, well, we have
two dogs, what--

26:06.999 --> 26:08.832
- It's what Scout want-,

26:08.834 --> 26:10.367
just listen, just listen.

26:10.369 --> 26:11.569
I need you, okay?

26:11.571 --> 26:13.103
This couldn't have
happened at a worse time

26:13.105 --> 26:14.738
and I have to try
and get through this

26:14.740 --> 26:16.607
and I have to do it now.

26:16.609 --> 26:18.842
Can you please get me some ice?

26:18.844 --> 26:20.711
- Look hon, I think we should
just postpone the party.

26:20.713 --> 26:21.579
- I'm not gonna p--

26:24.050 --> 26:25.449
I don't wanna p--

26:28.220 --> 26:29.453
I'm not gonna postpone.

26:31.958 --> 26:34.592
No, I'm not postponing, I'm not.

26:34.594 --> 26:36.927
The invites already went
out, people are ready,

26:36.929 --> 26:38.596
it is in less than two weeks.

26:40.700 --> 26:42.166
I need to obsess on this.

26:43.569 --> 26:46.170
I'm not gonna let this
hijack my life again, okay?

26:48.107 --> 26:49.807
Can you please just understand?

26:51.477 --> 26:52.343
- Yes.

26:54.947 --> 26:56.046
And I love you.

26:57.950 --> 27:00.050
And I will continue to love you

27:00.052 --> 27:01.819
after you crack all
those teeth in half.

27:06.792 --> 27:09.994
- I need to end this day.

27:09.996 --> 27:11.195
- Okay well you know what?

27:12.131 --> 27:13.097
I have a remedy for that.

27:13.099 --> 27:14.331
- No, no.
- Yeah,

27:14.333 --> 27:15.666
I think we just need
to do our thing.

27:15.668 --> 27:17.735
- It's not a thing,
stop with the thing.

27:17.737 --> 27:18.902
- Isn't it magical?

27:18.904 --> 27:20.971
- It's magical, honey.

27:20.973 --> 27:22.139
- It's the
healing power of dance.

27:24.477 --> 27:25.342
- Mm-hmm.

27:26.812 --> 27:28.178
That's super, mm-hmm.

27:28.180 --> 27:30.581
- You like that?
- Yeah, I like it.

27:30.583 --> 27:31.915
- I'm curing you.

27:31.917 --> 27:33.150
- You're not curing
me, but I love you.

27:33.152 --> 27:35.119
You're very cute.
- I love you.

27:35.121 --> 27:36.153
- I'm going to bed.

27:36.155 --> 27:37.054
- I'll be in in a bit.

27:38.591 --> 27:39.790
It's a lovely thing we got

27:39.792 --> 27:42.359
going on here.
- It's not a thing.

27:50.536 --> 27:51.468
- Hi.

27:51.470 --> 27:52.936
- Hi.

27:52.938 --> 27:54.038
- I love you.

27:55.608 --> 27:56.440
How do you feel?

28:00.146 --> 28:01.011
- A little anxious.

28:02.281 --> 28:03.113
Kind of sleepy.

28:04.283 --> 28:05.382
How do you feel?

28:05.384 --> 28:07.451
- In love with you.

29:30.402 --> 29:32.803
- Ugh, Boo pooped,
pooped, pooped on the rug.

29:32.805 --> 29:34.071
- Okay, alright.
- Come on.

29:34.073 --> 29:35.739
- Alright come here,
I cleaned it,

29:35.741 --> 29:37.307
but it just,
- No, no, no, no, no,

29:37.309 --> 29:38.809
sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.
- Stinks in there.

29:38.811 --> 29:40.077
- Come on Boo,

29:40.079 --> 29:41.111
come on.
- Max you gotta get dressed.

29:43.916 --> 29:45.582
Alright honey,
did you oversleep?

29:45.584 --> 29:47.618
- Yeah I overslept,
overslept a little bit, okay?

29:47.620 --> 29:49.219
I'm sorry.

29:49.221 --> 29:50.220
- What's that?

29:50.222 --> 29:51.155
What's that, I don't
even know what that is.

29:51.157 --> 29:52.790
That's like fish?

29:52.792 --> 29:54.158
- Fish?

29:54.160 --> 29:56.293
- I don't know.
- We haven't had fish lately.

29:56.295 --> 29:58.061
- Okay listen honey,
I got a list for you,

29:58.063 --> 29:59.329
okay, it's--
- Do you need that for school?

29:59.331 --> 30:02.332
- Anal and it's irritating
and it's, I'm sorry.

30:02.334 --> 30:03.634
- What's anal?

30:03.636 --> 30:05.903
- Anal means bossy,
honey, and poison.

30:05.905 --> 30:07.571
So just don't ever say it.
- Don't worry about it.

30:07.573 --> 30:10.240
- And run if you hear
anyone else say it to you.

30:10.242 --> 30:12.342
Hey hon, I gotta poo,
have you got this?

30:12.344 --> 30:16.480
- No Romeo, I do not,
I have camp now and

30:16.482 --> 30:18.148
we got a whole bunch
of stuff to do.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.850
If you just check
in during the day,

30:19.852 --> 30:21.852
we have Dr. Daly at 11.

30:21.854 --> 30:25.589
That's, mm, stuck,
that's not coming out.

30:25.591 --> 30:27.357
- 11?

30:27.359 --> 30:28.158
- Mom!

30:28.160 --> 30:29.159
- Kids?

30:29.161 --> 30:30.527
Go brush your teeth,
Max go brush your teeth.

30:30.529 --> 30:31.461
- If she
wears flip flops

30:31.463 --> 30:32.763
she's gonna get sent home.

30:32.765 --> 30:34.198
- She will now wear
flip flops, okay?

30:34.200 --> 30:36.033
Seriously hon, I was
gonna bid a job today.

30:36.035 --> 30:38.335
Is there anything that could
wait aside from my poop?

30:38.337 --> 30:40.003
- No honey, no.

30:40.005 --> 30:41.538
Everything got pushed because
of the doctors appointments,

30:41.540 --> 30:43.106
the pre-op stuff,
insurance calls.

30:43.108 --> 30:44.842
- Okay fine, fine,
I'll see you at 11.

30:44.844 --> 30:46.343
- Why are you yelling at me?

30:46.345 --> 30:48.812
- Because I'm trying to
scare the poop back in.

30:52.117 --> 30:53.483
- Yes, yes.
- No, no.

30:53.485 --> 30:54.284
I'll trade you.

30:54.286 --> 30:55.652
- No, that's all you.

30:55.654 --> 30:59.356
That's all you and
you're hot.

30:59.358 --> 31:01.325
- I don't feel too hot
right now, I feel horrible.

31:01.327 --> 31:02.559
I love you.
- I love you.

31:02.561 --> 31:04.294
- I'm strangely attracted
to you right now.

31:04.296 --> 31:05.796
- You're so stinky.

31:07.032 --> 31:08.532
I love you, get 'er done.

31:11.303 --> 31:13.036
So good.

31:13.038 --> 31:16.573
When you guys say next time
"I just wanna do crunches,"

31:16.575 --> 31:19.643
and then I systematically
punch you all

31:19.645 --> 31:23.146
in your whining faces, no
one gets to sue me, right?

31:23.148 --> 31:24.081
- Ugh, fine.

31:24.083 --> 31:25.315
- Yeah, whatever.

31:25.317 --> 31:26.583
- Good.

31:26.585 --> 31:28.518
- How many calories
does hate burn?

31:28.520 --> 31:31.755
- Oh my god, everybody
up, up, kettles.

31:31.757 --> 31:34.491
You're all gonna pay
for Debbie's naivety.

31:34.493 --> 31:36.493
Let's go, kettles,
rip it, pull it.

31:40.900 --> 31:42.633
So no class on Thursday, okay?

31:43.869 --> 31:47.938
- Does anybody else pee
every time we do jacks?

31:47.940 --> 31:51.041
- I just do it preemptively
now when I get out of the car.

31:51.043 --> 31:54.344
- Hang on wait, why is
there no class on Thursday?

31:54.346 --> 31:56.113
I mean not that I
don't need a break.

31:56.115 --> 31:58.181
- Me too, plus I
have to do taxes.

32:08.894 --> 32:10.761
- What? What's going on?

32:10.763 --> 32:13.597
- Yeah, you either
binged on kids cereal

32:13.599 --> 32:15.565
or there's something wrong.

32:17.369 --> 32:25.442
- Okay I might have a touch
of recurrent boob cancer.

32:26.412 --> 32:28.145
It's not a big deal.

32:28.147 --> 32:29.446
- God seriously?

32:29.448 --> 32:31.782
I was just whining
about my wrist.

32:31.784 --> 32:33.317
- It's fine.
- Somebody, anybody,

32:33.319 --> 32:35.786
kick me in my vagina
right now.

32:35.788 --> 32:39.423
- It's fine, I got it,
it's fine, seriously.

32:39.425 --> 32:42.326
There's no caloric
burn in vagina kicking.

32:42.328 --> 32:43.760
You guys.
- Oh crap.

32:43.762 --> 32:45.495
The big party,
you're gonna have to

32:45.497 --> 32:47.297
postpone.
- No, no, no.

32:47.299 --> 32:49.433
- Do you need help? We can--
- No, oh my god.

32:49.435 --> 32:50.467
Drew's got it.

32:50.469 --> 32:51.468
- Of course he does.

32:51.470 --> 32:53.470
- Yes, right.
- What about...

32:53.472 --> 32:55.505
What about that
duct tape incident?

32:55.507 --> 32:56.473
- Okay see now's
the time for the

32:56.475 --> 32:59.343
vagina kicking.
- It's fine, seriously.

32:59.345 --> 33:01.044
It's fine, he's got it, okay?

33:04.683 --> 33:08.952
Now we exercise because this
is like an intervention.

33:08.954 --> 33:10.187
It's super uncomfortable.

33:10.189 --> 33:11.955
Come on, I gave him a list.

33:11.957 --> 33:14.257
He's got the list
and it's going to be

33:14.259 --> 33:17.194
perfect and amazing and right.

33:17.196 --> 33:18.996
He's got this, he's a big boy.

33:30.342 --> 33:32.109
- You're gonna pass out.

33:33.512 --> 33:35.012
Or crap your pants.

33:35.781 --> 33:36.613
Listen.

33:37.449 --> 33:38.482
Stop.

33:38.484 --> 33:40.150
- No we have not talked about

33:40.152 --> 33:42.219
what your cancer
does to my balls.

33:43.322 --> 33:45.555
See, they've become slightly

33:45.557 --> 33:47.357
engorged.
- Oh my god.

33:47.359 --> 33:48.525
Oh my god, you forgot the word.

33:48.527 --> 33:49.893
- No, it's a different--
- You just--

33:49.895 --> 33:53.463
- No, it's the Latin term,
it's testiculus bigness.

33:54.500 --> 33:55.565
- Stop.

33:55.567 --> 33:57.401
- See, it's, and
they're misshapen.

34:00.539 --> 34:01.738
I can't even go on, hey.

34:01.740 --> 34:02.706
Hello Drew.

34:02.708 --> 34:03.707
- Hi.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.175
- Yeah you're looking good.

34:05.177 --> 34:05.976
- Thank you.

34:05.978 --> 34:06.743
- How are you?

34:06.745 --> 34:08.545
- This is,

34:08.547 --> 34:09.478
- No, it's good to see you guys

34:09.481 --> 34:10.480
are dealing as well as always.

34:10.482 --> 34:11.481
- We're doing fine.

34:12.985 --> 34:14.751
I have breast
implants in my balls.

34:15.587 --> 34:17.020
- Well why don't
you get up here?

34:17.022 --> 34:19.188
And why don't you
drag those over here.

34:19.190 --> 34:20.891
- Can I get a referral
for something?

34:20.893 --> 34:24.761
- Certainly,
I'll write that up.

34:24.763 --> 34:26.797
Well, so listen.

34:28.567 --> 34:31.435
The biopsy results came
back and it's HER2/neu.

34:34.039 --> 34:36.440
- Wait, so is that
better or worse?

34:36.442 --> 34:38.542
- Oh no, it's the
same aggressive cancer

34:38.543 --> 34:40.610
we found in Bailey's
right breast.

34:41.447 --> 34:45.014
But this time we
found it sooner.

34:46.185 --> 34:48.051
Still, we know how
quickly this travels.

34:48.053 --> 34:50.786
I would like to
move the surgery up.

34:53.358 --> 34:55.158
- Fine let's do it.
- We have Scout's party.

34:57.429 --> 34:58.462
We have Scout's party.

34:59.531 --> 35:00.730
- Are you kidding?

35:00.732 --> 35:02.632
- This isn't a go away
and think about it

35:02.634 --> 35:03.934
kind of thing, Bailey.

35:03.936 --> 35:06.937
This is a seconds
and inches situation.

35:06.939 --> 35:08.772
I wanna get you in next week.

35:08.774 --> 35:11.475
We'll go with the mastectomy,
we'll test the nodes,

35:11.477 --> 35:14.277
and then immediate
reconstruction and augmentation.

35:15.280 --> 35:16.780
- Next week?
- Next week.

35:16.782 --> 35:18.648
- Yeah, postpone the party.

35:18.650 --> 35:20.450
- Wait, wait, no.
- Yes.

35:20.452 --> 35:22.452
- We can do
both, we can do both.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.754
We can do the surgery
and the party.

35:24.756 --> 35:26.523
- No honey, we just--
- We got this.

35:31.230 --> 35:33.563
- Fine, we'll do it
next Monday then.

35:33.565 --> 35:36.733
I should be sober and
I believe my license

35:36.735 --> 35:38.668
is good through the
end of the month.

35:38.670 --> 35:41.404
So pretty
lucky all around.

35:41.406 --> 35:42.739
- One week.
- One week.

35:44.510 --> 35:46.743
- We'll just get
creative, right?

35:47.980 --> 35:50.614
Let's make it
happen, we got this.

35:55.120 --> 35:55.986
Pop?

36:03.695 --> 36:04.561
Pop?

36:07.666 --> 36:08.532
Pop?

36:11.370 --> 36:12.235
- What's that?

36:13.205 --> 36:14.671
Where'd the band go?

36:14.673 --> 36:16.506
- Uh, they...

36:16.508 --> 36:17.541
Oh, okay, um.

36:20.045 --> 36:21.378
Hey.
- Oh.

36:22.314 --> 36:24.014
How you doing, Clyde?

36:24.016 --> 36:26.283
- I'm doing
great, gorgeous, come on.

36:26.285 --> 36:27.584
Swing your hips.

36:28.487 --> 36:30.120
Drop it, okay last thing.

36:33.992 --> 36:36.126
- Pop, Pop, Pop, Pop.
- Away from your young,

36:36.128 --> 36:37.360
baby girl!

36:37.362 --> 36:38.662
- You know me?

36:38.664 --> 36:41.131
- Yes I know you, you
are my little fish.

36:41.133 --> 36:43.466
- I'm your little fish.
- Come on little fish,

36:43.468 --> 36:45.001
let's take a little swim, huh?

36:45.003 --> 36:48.338
Let's put a swing in
the swim, flip that fin.

36:53.178 --> 36:56.846
- You are the worst
finning shaking shark.

36:56.848 --> 36:58.548
Oh.

36:58.550 --> 37:02.252
- Pop, Pop!

37:05.157 --> 37:06.656
- Don't worry, don't worry.

37:06.658 --> 37:07.824
Freeze, just freeze.
- Why you pooping my party?

37:07.826 --> 37:09.759
- I'm not, I'm not, it's okay.

37:09.761 --> 37:11.528
We're just gonna move rooms.

37:11.530 --> 37:13.263
- Okay, I'll get a
broom and towels.

37:13.265 --> 37:15.599
- Okay,
good, good, good.

37:15.601 --> 37:16.933
- Ow.
- Okay.

37:16.935 --> 37:18.835
Okay, okay, okay,
just sit, sit, sit.

37:20.272 --> 37:21.838
- Mama's gonna kill me
if I don't clean this up.

37:21.840 --> 37:24.407
- No, no, no, I
got it, I got it, I got it.

37:24.409 --> 37:27.844
Okay let me see, let
me see this one, okay.

37:27.846 --> 37:29.512
- Momma's gonna kill me--

37:29.514 --> 37:31.214
- No, it's okay, it's okay
Pop, it's okay, it's okay.

37:31.216 --> 37:35.285
We'll tell her a story, okay?

37:35.287 --> 37:37.220
There we go, alright.

37:37.222 --> 37:39.022
- We have got
to get you to school.

37:54.773 --> 37:56.306
- So you found
the place alright.

37:56.308 --> 37:57.607
- Yeah,
directions were great.

37:57.609 --> 37:58.908
- Well Felicia recommended you,

37:58.910 --> 38:02.712
said you were quick,
reliable, one and done.

38:02.714 --> 38:03.947
- That's what she said.

38:08.620 --> 38:09.486
What'd she say.

38:11.657 --> 38:14.624
- Right, anyway so I'll
need some specialty pieces.

38:15.761 --> 38:20.630
- Really, well because my
specialty actually is woodwork.

38:21.633 --> 38:22.565
I do a lot of notch work.

38:22.567 --> 38:23.566
- I need display showing.

38:25.737 --> 38:26.670
- Okay.

38:26.672 --> 38:28.004
- Do you do any collecting?

38:28.740 --> 38:30.073
- Like Elvis plates?

38:31.276 --> 38:32.776
- No I'm thinking
fine collectibles.

38:32.778 --> 38:35.145
You see, my wife has a rare

38:35.147 --> 38:37.180
and precious cache
of collectibles

38:37.182 --> 38:41.484
and we need display
shelving to showcase them.

38:41.486 --> 38:45.088
You know, large, functional,
that won't distract the eye.

38:45.090 --> 38:46.356
- That's what she said.

38:47.359 --> 38:48.892
Sorry, that was involuntary.

39:08.180 --> 39:09.913
- Takes your breath
away, doesn't it?

39:10.782 --> 39:12.782
So I'll need wall to wall casing

39:12.784 --> 39:15.218
with shelving made to
my exact specifications.

39:16.221 --> 39:18.221
- Okay, he's all cleaned up.

39:18.223 --> 39:22.425
He's in there watching Law and
Order, podiatry or some shit.

39:24.830 --> 39:28.064
Glass is cleaned up,
feet are bandaged.

39:28.066 --> 39:29.799
I took all the sharp knives out

39:29.801 --> 39:31.401
and the knobs off the stove.

39:31.403 --> 39:32.702
- God, that is so good.

39:33.739 --> 39:35.138
Why is that so good?

39:35.140 --> 39:36.072
Is it the chemicals?

39:36.074 --> 39:36.940
- Yes.

39:38.744 --> 39:42.712
Okay I have about 12 helpers
lined up for you to interview.

39:43.815 --> 39:45.382
You can have them come
and go as you need

39:45.384 --> 39:48.284
until you decide
where you wanna go.

39:49.888 --> 39:50.720
We'll be fine.

39:53.992 --> 39:55.225
- It's just that, um,

39:57.729 --> 39:58.728
I can't tell him.

40:05.504 --> 40:09.873
I can't fix him,
he can't fix me,

40:09.875 --> 40:14.844
and he was the guy that I
would take everything to

40:14.846 --> 40:15.812
to make better.

40:18.083 --> 40:19.082
Now I'm screwed.

40:21.052 --> 40:23.019
- See, you're not.

40:25.056 --> 40:26.122
You've got coverage.

40:28.427 --> 40:29.259
All of us.

40:30.729 --> 40:35.432
Hell, Blue Cross is about to
pay for another perfect booby.

40:37.803 --> 40:40.737
Perfect teat.

40:41.740 --> 40:43.006
To make a matching new set.

40:44.910 --> 40:45.775
Clyde's here.

40:47.813 --> 40:49.145
He loves you like crazy.

40:52.884 --> 40:53.950
He's still in there.

40:55.654 --> 40:56.986
You just have to not claver.

41:03.595 --> 41:04.461
Okay sweetie.

41:05.597 --> 41:07.130
Come on, we gotta wrap this up.

41:08.934 --> 41:11.868
I've got big plans for us.

41:13.004 --> 41:14.971
- Oh no, no, no.

41:14.973 --> 41:18.608
Oh my god if you take
me to some cheese bag,

41:18.610 --> 41:22.011
desperate housewives
strip club, I will,

41:22.013 --> 41:23.613
I will end you.

41:23.615 --> 41:25.748
Did you just hurt yourself?

41:27.853 --> 41:29.986
Don't, don't take me.

41:31.756 --> 41:32.655
- Hey.

41:32.657 --> 41:34.023
- Come in.
- Hey.

41:34.993 --> 41:36.025
Come on in, buddy.

41:36.027 --> 41:38.027
- Hey, what's up?

41:38.029 --> 41:39.929
- What's up, buddy?
- Have a seat over here buddy.

41:39.931 --> 41:42.098
Oh is this the
helicopter explosion one?

41:42.100 --> 41:43.466
- No, diamond heist.

41:43.468 --> 41:45.268
- Oh, and check out
the armor car, buddy.

41:45.270 --> 41:47.837
Love that guy.

41:47.839 --> 41:48.872
- You're an idiot.

41:48.874 --> 41:50.340
- Six!

41:50.342 --> 41:51.608
- What's with the number?

41:51.610 --> 41:53.042
- Oh it's his acting teacher.

41:53.044 --> 41:55.712
He's got him labeling all
his emotions with numbers.

41:55.714 --> 41:59.315
Trying to enrich his work and
create a new process for him.

41:59.317 --> 42:00.984
- His process.

42:00.986 --> 42:03.019
- In the room, two.

42:04.389 --> 42:07.056
- But how goes it with the
big birthday plan of attack?

42:07.993 --> 42:09.859
- Pretty good, I'm prepping.

42:09.861 --> 42:12.161
- Yeah.
- Oh, what's it say?

42:12.163 --> 42:13.029
What is this?

42:13.965 --> 42:16.065
- Popo? You got Popo?

42:16.067 --> 42:17.867
- No, not yet, but...

42:17.869 --> 42:19.469
I mean I'm calling him.

42:19.471 --> 42:20.904
The puppy guy, right?

42:20.906 --> 42:24.307
- Yeah, dude, Popo the
puppy master is booked

42:24.309 --> 42:26.209
up to years in
advance here, okay?

42:26.211 --> 42:27.877
- Are you kidding?
- Ever since he got

42:27.879 --> 42:30.380
that free publicity for doing
Kanye's kid's birthday party,

42:30.382 --> 42:32.048
he's the ticket in LA.

42:32.050 --> 42:33.082
- Are you kidding?

42:33.084 --> 42:34.417
He's a dog walker,
are you kidding me?

42:34.419 --> 42:36.019
- Hey word has it
that Brangelina's

42:36.021 --> 42:39.689
fifth orphan just
got turned down.

42:39.691 --> 42:41.424
- Jesus.
- Yeah, I'm serious.

42:41.426 --> 42:43.059
- He's not
gonna do her party.

42:47.198 --> 42:48.932
- Hey, yes hello.

42:48.934 --> 42:54.003
I was calling to see if I
could book Popo for a party.

42:55.507 --> 42:56.839
Uh-huh.

42:56.841 --> 42:58.207
A referral?

42:58.209 --> 43:00.176
Of course I have a referral,
my wife told me to call.

43:01.446 --> 43:03.046
- Okay look, you
have to tell them

43:03.048 --> 43:04.247
that you're a celebrity
or your wife is,

43:04.249 --> 43:05.582
or they won't pay
- Yeah,

43:05.584 --> 43:06.883
you have to do this.
- Attention to you,

43:06.885 --> 43:07.784
they'll never.

43:07.786 --> 43:10.787
- Yeah, my wife referred me.

43:10.789 --> 43:13.389
She's...

43:13.391 --> 43:14.624
Bette Midler.

43:14.626 --> 43:16.025
- Bette Midler?

43:16.027 --> 43:17.126
She's like dead.
- Yep.

43:17.128 --> 43:19.963
Hello? Hello?

43:21.199 --> 43:22.465
It's not funny Keaton.

43:22.467 --> 43:23.800
- Laughter?

43:23.802 --> 43:25.969
- Yeah, little bit and
a pfft at the end too.

43:25.971 --> 43:27.604
- You know what,
let's go right now.

43:27.606 --> 43:29.138
Where is this, where's the--
- What are we gonna do?

43:29.140 --> 43:31.374
- No, where's this
Poopy located?

43:31.376 --> 43:33.376
- We're not gonna go meet
up someone named Poopy.

43:33.378 --> 43:35.645
- Okay this is
not a seven Lance,

43:35.647 --> 43:38.147
we have to handle this with a
little bit of finesse, okay?

43:38.149 --> 43:42.151
We can't just tackle
this like an Olsen twin.

43:43.888 --> 43:46.055
- That's great, that's
just, that's great.

43:47.292 --> 43:49.459
- You totally clocked her man.

43:49.461 --> 43:51.060
- You know what? I fell.

43:51.062 --> 43:52.562
- On her.

43:52.564 --> 43:55.298
- Look I can't even read half
of this chicken scratch, man.

43:55.300 --> 43:57.433
Come on Drew,
what's your plan B?

43:57.435 --> 43:59.168
- You mean after
Bailey castrates me?

43:59.170 --> 44:00.269
- We need to find
some entertainment.

44:00.271 --> 44:01.304
- Yeah, I know.

44:01.306 --> 44:03.072
- Bro.

44:03.074 --> 44:04.073
- What?

44:04.075 --> 44:05.408
No, no.
- Bro.

44:06.578 --> 44:07.744
- No, absolutely not.
- No, look at this.

44:07.746 --> 44:09.145
Hey, here we go.

44:14.819 --> 44:15.652
- Don't encourage him.

44:15.654 --> 44:17.353
- See kids? They dig it.

44:17.355 --> 44:18.588
Look at him.

44:18.590 --> 44:20.957
Seriously, right Calvin?
- That's one kid.

44:20.959 --> 44:21.858
- Keaton.

44:21.860 --> 44:22.825
Keaton, yeah.
- Keaton.

44:22.827 --> 44:24.127
I was close.

44:24.129 --> 44:25.261
- Okay we got a
lot of stuff to do

44:25.263 --> 44:26.829
and we don't have a
lot of time to do it

44:26.831 --> 44:28.498
so let's saddle up.

44:28.500 --> 44:30.033
- Boom, that's right Calvin!

44:30.035 --> 44:31.501
- Keaton.
- Keaton.

44:34.272 --> 44:36.205
- If we stick with the list,
we're gonna be totally fine.

44:36.207 --> 44:38.174
- A viking party,
they could totally--

44:38.176 --> 44:39.208
- Lance.

44:39.210 --> 44:40.143
- Swords!

44:40.145 --> 44:41.010
- Let it go.
- Ugh, five.

44:42.480 --> 44:44.480
- Look I wasn't gonna agree
with him but that doesn't mean

44:44.482 --> 44:46.282
we can't incorporate a
little bit of creativity.

44:46.284 --> 44:48.017
- Frickin' incorporate.

44:48.019 --> 44:49.719
- Seriously, I mean who
cares about this stuff?

44:49.721 --> 44:50.720
Scout is not gonna care.

44:50.722 --> 44:52.722
- Mommies care, Bailey cares.

44:52.724 --> 44:55.291
You wanna pick here to
insert your creative license?

44:58.196 --> 44:59.062
- What is that?

45:00.065 --> 45:01.197
- It's for me, it's a taco.

45:01.199 --> 45:02.198
- Just shut up.

45:02.200 --> 45:03.232
Hey what's up man?

45:03.234 --> 45:05.001
We need to get some balloons.

45:05.003 --> 45:08.905
Four blue, four yellow,
and was it three...

45:08.907 --> 45:11.174
Is that my nard puppy balloon?

45:11.176 --> 45:13.810
Mine, three mine nard...

45:13.812 --> 45:15.011
- Mylar.

45:15.013 --> 45:16.312
- Mylar.

45:16.314 --> 45:18.014
Three mylar puppy balloons.

45:18.016 --> 45:20.049
- Yeah well
we're back ordered

45:20.051 --> 45:21.250
on all the puppy mylars.

45:21.252 --> 45:24.287
We're not expecting any
new stock until October.

45:29.060 --> 45:31.861
- Okay can you
call another store?

45:31.863 --> 45:34.263
- Well I can, but they won't.

45:34.265 --> 45:36.566
There's been like a
total run on puppies

45:36.568 --> 45:39.202
ever since the Puppy
Power Box Set release.

45:39.204 --> 45:40.903
Some of that stuff
going for like

45:40.905 --> 45:43.706
50 bucks pop on
Ebay last I checked.

45:43.708 --> 45:44.907
- These?

45:44.909 --> 45:46.242
- Yeah.

45:46.244 --> 45:47.710
- Well what about
the display model?

45:47.712 --> 45:48.611
- It's display only.

45:48.613 --> 45:50.213
- I'll pay double.

45:50.215 --> 45:51.080
- Display only.

45:51.082 --> 45:52.381
- I'll pay even more.

45:52.383 --> 45:54.117
Okay, hold on, guys,
guys, what do you got?

45:54.119 --> 45:56.085
Put down the taco.

45:57.722 --> 45:59.088
- Alright I got one.

45:59.090 --> 46:00.123
I've got a few singles.

46:00.125 --> 46:01.190

46:01.192 --> 46:02.458
counting out loud?
- I got four.

46:02.460 --> 46:03.426

- Hold on, I'm not done.

46:03.428 --> 46:05.628
I got change, I got 64 cents.

46:05.630 --> 46:06.763
Four dollars and 64 cents.

46:06.765 --> 46:08.231
- One punch away
from a free sub.

46:08.233 --> 46:10.199
- He doesn't want, okay
we got like 28 bucks.

46:10.201 --> 46:11.134
$20 bucks, okay?

46:11.136 --> 46:12.101
- Display only.

46:14.405 --> 46:16.172
- Do you know any other words?

46:17.809 --> 46:19.475
- Oh, oh, what
about a belt sander?

46:19.477 --> 46:21.577
You look like a belt sander guy.

46:21.579 --> 46:22.445
- Wait a second.

46:23.882 --> 46:26.582
Aren't you that midget dude
who knocked out the Olsen twin?

46:26.584 --> 46:30.453
Oh my god, hold
on, hold on, whoa, whoa.

46:32.157 --> 46:33.756
Oh.

46:33.758 --> 46:34.624
- Four.

46:39.631 --> 46:42.231
- Okay, take all
this, take my wallet.

46:42.801 --> 46:44.267
I got an idea,
I'll be right back.

46:44.269 --> 46:45.134
- Okay.

46:46.404 --> 46:48.137
You think we might be able
to get that display dog?

46:48.139 --> 46:49.138
- No.

46:51.242 --> 46:52.675
- How's it feel?

46:52.677 --> 46:54.177
To be a dream crusher.

46:59.083 --> 47:01.083
- Last time I watch
your horrible kids.

47:01.085 --> 47:01.918
- Right?

47:02.954 --> 47:04.253
Don't they suck?

47:04.255 --> 47:05.121
I'm selling them.

47:05.123 --> 47:06.022
- Market's right.

47:08.426 --> 47:10.593
This wasn't supposed to happen.

47:10.595 --> 47:11.861
This is all bullshit.

47:11.863 --> 47:13.496
- Ooh, you
owe me a dollar.

47:13.498 --> 47:16.132
- They each made like $17
off of me today, whatever.

47:16.134 --> 47:17.433
You're gonna be fine, right?

47:18.970 --> 47:20.303
Right?

47:20.305 --> 47:23.272
- Yes, yes, everybody's fine.

47:23.274 --> 47:25.741
Except Drew is improvising.

47:27.178 --> 47:28.978
- How's he doing with all this?

47:28.980 --> 47:30.112
- He's...

47:31.349 --> 47:32.215
He's just...

47:33.351 --> 47:34.217
I don't know.

47:35.787 --> 47:37.353
Wow.

47:37.355 --> 47:38.154
I suck.

47:38.156 --> 47:39.222
- No, your boobs suck.

47:40.692 --> 47:41.958
You suck and you suck.

47:44.662 --> 47:45.962
Listen, everyone had snacks,

47:45.964 --> 47:47.563
did homework, and
dug ditches for me.

47:47.565 --> 47:49.498
- Alright, thanks again sweets.

47:49.500 --> 47:51.133
You at camp tomorrow?

47:51.135 --> 47:53.803
- I can't wait to pee in my
pants and barf up coffee.

47:53.805 --> 47:55.238
Have fun with your sucky kids.

47:56.374 --> 47:58.641
- Come here sucky
kids, come here.

48:00.545 --> 48:02.545
- Oh, here we go.

48:04.082 --> 48:05.381
- This is ridiculous,
you know that?

48:05.383 --> 48:07.049
- Not if it works.
- Yeah.

48:14.759 --> 48:16.058
- Thank you so much
for doing this man,

48:16.060 --> 48:17.326
I really appreciate it.

48:17.328 --> 48:19.562
Okay just go in
there, and don't talk,

48:19.564 --> 48:22.999
and just be my big,
intimidating Black friend.

48:23.001 --> 48:24.300
That's all you gotta do.

48:31.342 --> 48:32.441
- What?

48:39.918 --> 48:41.851
- Listen up, alright?

48:41.853 --> 48:43.719
We need these damn balloons,

48:43.721 --> 48:45.621
okay, alright?

48:45.623 --> 48:46.489
Ooh.

48:49.027 --> 48:52.929
What I'm saying is let
us have the balloons.

48:52.931 --> 48:53.896
- She doesn't like ponies?

48:53.898 --> 48:55.264
What every little kid likes,

48:55.266 --> 48:57.867
oh, oh, nevermind, we got
it, puppies on the way.

49:00.772 --> 49:02.405
I can't believe this.

49:02.407 --> 49:04.407
I promise, I will never
ask you to do this again.

49:04.409 --> 49:07.176
- Oh you are such a liar,
but I love your wife.

49:08.479 --> 49:10.479
- Hey I need entertainment
for this party.

49:10.481 --> 49:11.447
What are you doing this week?

49:11.449 --> 49:12.415
I need a wing man.

49:12.417 --> 49:13.416
- Mm-mm.
- Uh hello,

49:13.418 --> 49:14.951
sitting right here.

49:14.953 --> 49:16.819
- A Black super gay wing man.

49:16.821 --> 49:20.089
- Ooh, you are so cute when
you're desperate, okay?

49:20.091 --> 49:20.957
But no.

49:27.332 --> 49:28.764
- You okay?

49:28.766 --> 49:30.366
- Sure, can I have some milk?

49:31.836 --> 49:33.736
- Yes, yes you can
have some milk.

49:36.140 --> 49:37.440
You sure?

49:37.442 --> 49:38.307
- Yeah.

49:44.449 --> 49:45.314
- Alright.

49:49.654 --> 49:50.519
Look at me.

49:53.458 --> 49:54.323
Spill it.

49:58.363 --> 50:00.096
Come here, come here.

50:01.265 --> 50:03.566
One, two, three,
oh my god.

50:07.438 --> 50:12.475
Okay, you know that I
will hunt and torture you

50:12.477 --> 50:13.409
until you give in, so.

50:15.446 --> 50:18.047
- I know about Santa.

50:20.351 --> 50:21.450
- Oh.

50:24.022 --> 50:25.354
Who squealed?

50:25.356 --> 50:28.391
- Kids talk about it at school,
but I came to it on my own.

50:28.393 --> 50:32.328
Don't go after anyone, okay?

50:32.330 --> 50:33.195
- Okay.

50:34.032 --> 50:35.631
- I've known for
a while, I just,

50:37.402 --> 50:38.734
I didn't want you to be sad.

50:39.904 --> 50:43.005
I don't know why I'm
so sad right now.

50:43.007 --> 50:43.873
- Oh baby.

50:45.309 --> 50:46.108
Okay.

50:51.416 --> 50:53.249
- I'm right, right?

50:59.891 --> 51:03.993
- Alright I know that
it's hard sometimes,

51:03.995 --> 51:06.162
this growing up thing.

51:07.265 --> 51:12.268
But I want, I need you to know

51:12.270 --> 51:16.272
that there is beauty and
magic in the world, okay?

51:17.508 --> 51:21.210
There are things
of mystery and awe

51:21.212 --> 51:23.512
everywhere you look and go.

51:23.514 --> 51:24.780
- Mm-hmm.

51:24.782 --> 51:27.450
Like aliens and Sasquatch
and the black hole.

51:27.452 --> 51:29.251
- Yeah, yeah.

51:29.253 --> 51:33.489
And sunrises and hope
and human kindness.

51:34.725 --> 51:37.359
Can you trust me that
this is important?

51:39.797 --> 51:43.532
That I need you to fight, okay?

51:43.534 --> 51:45.568
To always believe in that, okay?

51:45.570 --> 51:48.571
- Mm-hmm, I get it.

51:48.573 --> 51:52.308
- Alright, can you just
hug me for a second?

51:59.484 --> 52:01.884
- I heard you talking
to Aunt Paula.

52:03.654 --> 52:08.457
I know the cancer's back.

52:08.459 --> 52:10.493
- Oh babe.

52:10.495 --> 52:14.463
Is that what all this Santa,
I'm a big guy stuff is about?

52:15.633 --> 52:18.634
- Kinda, I just want you
to know I can handle it.

52:19.437 --> 52:20.302
I'll be okay.

52:21.005 --> 52:22.404
You were okay last time.

52:23.674 --> 52:26.475
You'll be okay this time, right?

52:26.477 --> 52:27.543
- Yes.

52:30.681 --> 52:31.647
I'm gonna be okay.

52:34.185 --> 52:35.518
Look at me, I'm gonna be fine.

52:37.088 --> 52:38.354
- Okay.

52:38.356 --> 52:40.489
- Alright, trust me,
I'm gonna be fine.

52:41.626 --> 52:42.725
Oh my god.

52:48.432 --> 52:49.765
- Can I play video games now?

52:49.767 --> 52:53.569
- Yes, I get
five more seconds.

52:56.641 --> 52:57.540
- Five.

52:57.542 --> 52:59.141
- Okay.

52:59.143 --> 53:00.276
Okay, get out of here.

53:09.053 --> 53:10.719
- Okay, I thought
this was gonna be fun.

53:10.721 --> 53:12.855
Get that away from, that
doesn't have a face.

53:12.857 --> 53:14.490
I don't want, I'm
not looking at it.

53:14.492 --> 53:15.291
- Lance.
- No.

53:15.293 --> 53:16.392
- Lance.
- No,

53:16.394 --> 53:17.660
I can't.
- Come here Lance.

53:17.662 --> 53:18.727
- We need to go.

53:18.729 --> 53:19.628
- I know.
- Right now, I can't.

53:19.630 --> 53:20.829
Now, because I can't.

53:20.831 --> 53:22.398
Stop.

53:22.400 --> 53:23.732
- Come on,

53:23.734 --> 53:24.900
come on, he loves it.
- I'm serious, I'm gonna,

53:24.902 --> 53:26.735
I'm gonna punch you in the face.

53:27.538 --> 53:31.173
Okay everything
about that was wrong.

53:31.175 --> 53:35.511
Seriously, are you getting
paid like a lot to do this?

53:35.513 --> 53:37.012
- Money's alright.

53:37.014 --> 53:39.815
Weird thing is that guy,
he's not even married.

53:40.551 --> 53:41.650
- Ew.

53:49.393 --> 53:54.463
Are you like, I mean okay
with Bailey and all the...

53:55.733 --> 53:57.266
- Oh yeah, yeah, I'm,

53:58.669 --> 54:00.369
I mean as good as can
be expected, right?

54:00.371 --> 54:02.838
- Because I mean if
you ever, you need to

54:02.840 --> 54:05.241
talk or I don't know, uh,

54:07.411 --> 54:10.379
I can listen or whatever.

54:10.381 --> 54:13.549
Because you probably
are thinking about some

54:13.551 --> 54:16.518
pretty horrible stuff, I mean.

54:16.520 --> 54:20.189
I bet you can think of things
that are like the worst

54:20.191 --> 54:22.992
possible scenarios.

54:25.263 --> 54:28.564
This is kind of an
Alan thing, isn't it?

54:28.566 --> 54:29.365
- Yep.

54:29.367 --> 54:30.699
- Do you wanna hug or?

54:30.701 --> 54:31.700
- Nope.

54:31.702 --> 54:32.801
- Shotgun.

55:03.834 --> 55:06.902
- You know honey I
have no idea where Scout is.

55:06.904 --> 55:08.837
- I really wanted to
see if I could find her

55:08.839 --> 55:11.674
because I need to
give her a tickle.

55:11.676 --> 55:12.641
Rahh.

55:12.643 --> 55:16.779
You like that, you like that?

55:16.781 --> 55:19.248
- Dada you must
tickle the child.

55:19.250 --> 55:22.685
- No I must wash the
stink from my body.

55:22.687 --> 55:25.421
- Yeah, honey come on
were not done here.

55:25.423 --> 55:26.322
You gotta finish.

55:27.525 --> 55:28.757
- Let me go say hi to boy,

55:28.759 --> 55:30.859
then I'll come share
my stink with you.

55:30.861 --> 55:31.794
- Uh, goodie.

55:31.796 --> 55:32.895
Hold on babe.

55:34.765 --> 55:38.000
Max overheard Paula
on the phone today

55:38.002 --> 55:41.804
and he knows all about...

55:41.806 --> 55:44.740
We talked and Scout still...

55:46.977 --> 55:48.610
- How'd it go?

55:48.612 --> 55:51.413
- He's processing.

55:53.451 --> 55:54.683
- Wonder where he gets it from.

55:55.720 --> 55:57.753
- Shut up, go bouncing.

56:09.400 --> 56:10.399
- Dad, watch.

56:12.970 --> 56:13.936
- Nice.

56:14.905 --> 56:16.071
Hey buddy, come here.

56:17.141 --> 56:18.240
I wanna talk to you.

56:19.143 --> 56:21.143
Hey so I heard you
talked to Mom today.

56:24.081 --> 56:25.881
You okay?

56:25.883 --> 56:26.749
- I guess.

56:27.918 --> 56:29.184
- You know your mom's
like the strongest woman

56:29.186 --> 56:31.019
in the world, right?

56:31.021 --> 56:31.920
- Mm-hmm.

56:31.922 --> 56:32.921
- She's not going anywhere.

56:32.923 --> 56:34.490
Do you get that?

56:37.428 --> 56:37.910
- Yeah.

56:37.911 --> 56:38.393
- It's just this
cancer thing is just

56:38.396 --> 56:40.062
one big old pain in the butt.

56:41.899 --> 56:42.731
Or boob.

56:44.735 --> 56:48.070
- Is Mom okay with Grandpa

56:48.072 --> 56:51.006
and all this stuff
that's going on?

56:58.783 --> 57:02.618
- Your Mom has a very specific
way of dealing with things.

57:08.793 --> 57:09.658
Like you.

57:16.767 --> 57:17.800
- Did you see that?

57:17.802 --> 57:19.134
- Yes, do you
wanna do it again?

57:19.136 --> 57:20.869
- Please?
- One more time, big man.

57:21.872 --> 57:22.805
- Hi, Scoutie.

57:24.074 --> 57:25.707
- Hi Dada.

57:25.709 --> 57:28.243
Hey babe, can you
get this for me?

57:28.245 --> 57:29.378
- Yeah.

57:29.380 --> 57:31.046
Oh my god, you look so hot.

57:31.048 --> 57:32.915
You should stay home, we
should do it right now.

57:35.486 --> 57:37.219
What is this?
- A zipper.

57:37.221 --> 57:41.023
- Oh.

57:44.762 --> 57:46.895
- It's weird actually
looking at them.

57:46.897 --> 57:47.963
- I know right?

57:47.965 --> 57:51.133
Look at Scout, she's
like a baby and he's

57:51.135 --> 57:52.334
- So little.

57:55.606 --> 57:56.905
- God, I haven't seen
these since then.

57:58.843 --> 58:01.443
I mean it's weird how I was
all gung ho to film everything

58:01.445 --> 58:03.512
and then just not.

58:04.849 --> 58:06.849
- Okay, you had some
stuff on your mind.

58:12.189 --> 58:14.590
- Ah, that's Paula.

58:14.592 --> 58:15.858
- Yeah, let's pretend
we're not here.

58:17.194 --> 58:18.961
Seriously, we could be
having sex right now.

58:18.963 --> 58:21.129
- Super idea.
- Mm-hmm.

58:21.131 --> 58:23.332
- No.

58:23.334 --> 58:25.167
It's ladies night.

58:25.169 --> 58:28.170
- Wow hating it, okay.
- Let's go.

59:03.040 --> 59:05.474
- I don't even know what you...

59:07.545 --> 59:08.977
Ew.

59:08.979 --> 59:10.546
- What's in that?

59:10.548 --> 59:12.514
- Everything, I put
everything in there.

59:12.516 --> 59:13.382
- Oh, god.

59:14.518 --> 59:16.184
We have to get out of here.

59:16.186 --> 59:17.319
- What, you want a beer?

59:17.321 --> 59:19.321
- You smell like beer.

59:19.323 --> 59:21.757
- You want a bagel with shmear?

59:25.529 --> 59:28.664
- You guys, this is
good, this is good.

59:28.666 --> 59:31.033
Good, good, good, good.
- We did good.

59:31.035 --> 59:32.701
- We should go.

59:32.703 --> 59:35.370
- Oh come on, Debbie hasn't
even taken her top off yet.

59:35.372 --> 59:36.939
We need to wait.

59:36.941 --> 59:39.775
- Alright Debbie, five
minutes for that to happen

59:39.777 --> 59:45.781
or, or two lumbersexuals
pass by, and then we can go.

59:45.783 --> 59:47.783
One, there's one, one.

59:47.785 --> 59:49.117
- Debbie, drink up.

59:50.054 --> 59:53.455
- Alright we're almost
there, it's so close.

59:53.457 --> 59:55.958
It's so hot, you should
probably take your top off.

59:55.960 --> 59:57.092
Hello?

59:58.462 --> 01:00:01.964
Yes, hi, hi Mr. Lewis.

01:00:01.966 --> 01:00:02.965
Yes.

01:00:02.967 --> 01:00:03.999
- I'm gonna go dance.

01:00:14.411 --> 01:00:17.279
- When I was a young child
I liked to come here.

01:00:20.050 --> 01:00:21.149
What's up?

01:00:21.151 --> 01:00:22.417
- Dad's landlord.

01:00:22.419 --> 01:00:24.086
- Mr. Shitsburg?

01:00:24.088 --> 01:00:28.090
- Yes, there's music and he
says he's calling the cops.

01:00:28.092 --> 01:00:29.591
Drew's on his way over
there, I have to go.

01:00:29.593 --> 01:00:31.493
- Okay, you gotta go.

01:00:31.495 --> 01:00:32.294
- We're going?

01:00:32.296 --> 01:00:33.161
- Yep, we gotta go

01:00:33.163 --> 01:00:34.796
now.
- Not now.

01:00:34.798 --> 01:00:37.933
Oh but Debbie, she hasn't
even taken off her top yet.

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:44.840
- Really bitch?

01:00:44.842 --> 01:00:46.174
That's like the third time
you've bumped into me.

01:00:46.176 --> 01:00:47.075
- What?

01:00:47.077 --> 01:00:48.076
Really?

01:00:48.078 --> 01:00:50.145
- Yeah, watch
where you're going.

01:00:50.147 --> 01:00:52.848
Apologize, you need to
say sorry, seriously.

01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:54.516
- Oh you're kidding right now.

01:00:54.518 --> 01:00:56.184
See, I was gonna make it okay.

01:00:56.186 --> 01:00:57.686
I pushed you.

01:00:57.688 --> 01:00:59.321
- Uh, yeah.
- Did I push you like that?

01:00:59.323 --> 01:01:00.522
- Wow you did

01:01:00.524 --> 01:01:01.456
not just do that.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:01:01.458 --> 01:01:02.958
Did I push you like that?

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:03.859
- No it was like this.

01:01:03.861 --> 01:01:04.960
- No it was more like that.

01:01:04.962 --> 01:01:08.030
- Oh god, Jesus lady, come on!

01:01:12.336 --> 01:01:13.435
- Clyde?

01:01:14.371 --> 01:01:16.505
- I'm calling the
police, you hear me?

01:01:16.507 --> 01:01:17.939
- Yes, Mr. Lewis.

01:01:17.941 --> 01:01:19.641
I'm very sorry, I'm gonna go in,

01:01:19.643 --> 01:01:20.642
I'm gonna turn down the music.

01:01:20.644 --> 01:01:22.110
Don't worry about it, okay?

01:01:22.112 --> 01:01:23.612
- I'm calling the police.

01:01:23.614 --> 01:01:25.047
He loves his music.

01:01:25.049 --> 01:01:26.114
You know what I love?

01:01:26.116 --> 01:01:27.649
- Your tank top?

01:01:27.651 --> 01:01:29.985
- I love a good bagel
and cream cheese

01:01:29.987 --> 01:01:32.120
and a nice glass of 2% milk

01:01:32.122 --> 01:01:34.156
and my peace and quiet.

01:01:34.158 --> 01:01:35.490
I won't have it anymore.

01:01:35.492 --> 01:01:36.725
- Okay, it's fine, fine.

01:01:36.727 --> 01:01:38.460
Just please sir,
just go back inside.

01:01:38.462 --> 01:01:39.661
- He's out by the
end of the month.

01:01:39.663 --> 01:01:41.129
- Look, just give him a chance.

01:01:41.131 --> 01:01:42.030
- I'm done.

01:01:42.032 --> 01:01:44.232
You and that lady can just

01:01:44.234 --> 01:01:45.033
take him.
- What?

01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:46.234
What'd you say?

01:01:46.236 --> 01:01:47.069
No.

01:01:47.071 --> 01:01:49.004
That's my wife, okay?

01:01:49.006 --> 01:01:50.072
I don't want you even
thinking her name,

01:01:50.074 --> 01:01:51.740
you understand that?

01:01:51.742 --> 01:01:53.041
If you're gonna say any
more dumb shit right now,

01:01:53.043 --> 01:01:55.043
I'll have the city inspector
around here so fast.

01:01:55.045 --> 01:01:56.211
Shut the hell up.

01:01:57.181 --> 01:01:58.346
- He's out by the
end of the month.

01:01:58.348 --> 01:01:59.548
- Fine.
- Already started

01:01:59.550 --> 01:02:01.116
the paperwork.
- Fine, stop talking.

01:02:03.587 --> 01:02:04.753
Piss off back inside.

01:02:07.024 --> 01:02:08.190
- What's going on out here?

01:02:08.192 --> 01:02:10.058
Are you a taxi driver?

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:12.494
- No, Clyde it's me.

01:02:12.496 --> 01:02:14.262
Bailey's husband, Drew.

01:02:14.264 --> 01:02:15.831
- Oh well, come on inside.

01:02:22.406 --> 01:02:24.506
- You asked everyone?

01:02:24.508 --> 01:02:26.341
- Yep, just about.

01:02:26.343 --> 01:02:29.177
Nobody smokes cigarettes
anymore, they all just vape.

01:02:30.013 --> 01:02:31.580
- It's because they're tourists.

01:02:33.016 --> 01:02:33.849
Ugh.

01:02:37.354 --> 01:02:39.087
Where is the car?

01:02:39.089 --> 01:02:41.089
- Mm, Uber says 15 minutes.

01:02:45.696 --> 01:02:46.528
- Paula.

01:02:47.698 --> 01:02:48.830
Did you see her face?

01:02:50.634 --> 01:02:51.500
- She's fine.

01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:54.269
- You looked?

01:02:54.271 --> 01:02:55.437
You looked at her after?

01:02:55.439 --> 01:02:56.738
Did you see?

01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:58.473
- She's okay, she...

01:02:59.710 --> 01:03:00.842
She was stupid anyway.

01:03:07.785 --> 01:03:08.617
- Wilma.

01:03:10.287 --> 01:03:12.154
Will you do me a huge favor?

01:03:13.323 --> 01:03:15.257
Will you find me a cigarette?

01:03:15.259 --> 01:03:16.691
Just one, just one.

01:03:17.494 --> 01:03:18.927
Remember that time you guys?

01:03:18.929 --> 01:03:21.663
When it was the whole
class was burpees

01:03:21.665 --> 01:03:24.299
for the entire hour
and that's all I did?

01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:28.804
Please help me, please
get me anything, please.

01:03:37.614 --> 01:03:38.480
- That was mean.

01:03:39.616 --> 01:03:40.582
- I'm mean.

01:03:45.455 --> 01:03:46.321
I'm mean now.

01:04:01.338 --> 01:04:03.705
- That was a hell of a sandwich.

01:04:03.707 --> 01:04:05.106
- Glad you liked it.

01:04:05.108 --> 01:04:06.775
- You did good work Drew.

01:04:06.777 --> 01:04:08.210
- You remember who I am?

01:04:08.212 --> 01:04:09.611
- Sure.

01:04:09.613 --> 01:04:11.913
You're the other man
in my sweet Bay's life.

01:04:15.319 --> 01:04:16.218
- Yeah well I think her heart's

01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:17.519
always gonna belong to Daddy.

01:04:20.224 --> 01:04:21.289
- So how's it going?

01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:24.226
You treating my
little girl right?

01:04:24.228 --> 01:04:25.560
- Yes, absolutely.

01:04:27.998 --> 01:04:29.097
Yeah.

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:32.367
I don't know what
the hell I'm doing.

01:04:33.303 --> 01:04:36.204
It's like they should give
you a map for this crap.

01:04:36.206 --> 01:04:39.541
All this stuff comes up, right?

01:04:39.543 --> 01:04:43.311
And you just, you're trying
to like stay on top of it

01:04:43.313 --> 01:04:44.913
and you just...

01:04:44.915 --> 01:04:47.315
Whatever you do, just more and
more stuff keeps piling up,

01:04:49.353 --> 01:04:50.719
you never...

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.086
I feel like I can
never fix it, right?

01:04:52.089 --> 01:04:54.522
I just wanna fix it, but
every time you fix something,

01:04:54.524 --> 01:04:57.759
something else comes
up, every single day.

01:04:57.761 --> 01:05:01.363
- It's like trying to hold
water in your bare hands.

01:05:01.365 --> 01:05:04.099
- Yes, yes, exactly you know?

01:05:04.101 --> 01:05:05.400
It's like trying to hold water

01:05:05.402 --> 01:05:07.469
and I need this water.

01:05:11.742 --> 01:05:13.742
And I can't afford
not to get it right.

01:05:16.046 --> 01:05:17.279
- You know what I know?

01:05:18.181 --> 01:05:19.748
Love's the answer to everything.

01:05:22.586 --> 01:05:23.451
And a bucket.

01:05:26.256 --> 01:05:28.723
You need something to
hold all that water right?

01:05:28.725 --> 01:05:31.359
I mean if you're the one
standing by the hole in the dam,

01:05:31.361 --> 01:05:33.628
you're gonna need a
mighty strong finger.

01:05:33.630 --> 01:05:36.698
If not, get ready for the flood.

01:05:38.769 --> 01:05:41.970
My Bay, she's a
hell of a swimmer.

01:05:43.407 --> 01:05:45.440
We would tread water for days.

01:05:47.277 --> 01:05:50.445
So you might wanna stop trying
to hold onto all that water

01:05:51.949 --> 01:05:54.816
and start treading,
or maybe float.

01:05:56.286 --> 01:05:57.485
She'll float with you.

01:06:17.407 --> 01:06:20.375
- You have got to lock the door.

01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:24.212
- It's a little creepy.

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:27.449
- God, why aren't we
doing that every night?

01:06:27.451 --> 01:06:29.517
- Because we're stupid.

01:06:29.519 --> 01:06:30.652
You, mostly.

01:06:31.421 --> 01:06:33.355
When did bar fights
make you so horny?

01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:37.492
- Oh it was a life
affirming thing.

01:06:38.762 --> 01:06:41.763
- You wanna talk about it?

01:06:41.765 --> 01:06:43.365
- No, I don't.

01:06:45.369 --> 01:06:49.671
It was embarrassing
and mortifying and

01:06:51.141 --> 01:06:54.542
no I don't wanna talk about
it, I just want you to be here

01:06:54.544 --> 01:06:57.345
and perfect and warm and you.

01:06:58.448 --> 01:07:00.015
- Done.

01:07:00.017 --> 01:07:01.950
- Dad was...

01:07:01.952 --> 01:07:04.052
- Aw.

01:07:04.054 --> 01:07:05.387
- Hmm?

01:07:05.389 --> 01:07:07.589
- Hon, it's time,
you know he's...

01:07:09.326 --> 01:07:13.395
- Okay, I
mean I know the place

01:07:13.397 --> 01:07:15.530
that I would want
him to go, I was just

01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:17.065
waiting for it to get bad.

01:07:19.503 --> 01:07:20.435
- It's time, it's bad.

01:07:29.579 --> 01:07:30.412
What?

01:07:30.414 --> 01:07:31.546
- Do the thing.

01:07:33.383 --> 01:07:34.916
Do, do the thing.

01:07:34.918 --> 01:07:36.851
- Oh, no, no.

01:07:36.853 --> 01:07:37.852
- Do the thing,

01:07:37.854 --> 01:07:38.653
do the thing.
- No.

01:07:38.655 --> 01:07:39.821
- Come on, I need it,

01:07:39.823 --> 01:07:40.655
I need it.
- I don't want it,

01:07:40.657 --> 01:07:43.091
why?
- I need it.

01:07:48.265 --> 01:07:50.165
- Oh these look perfect.

01:07:57.874 --> 01:08:00.208
To want for love
it for the action.

01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:05.580
Ah!

01:08:05.582 --> 01:08:07.215
- What's happening?
- I love it.

01:08:07.217 --> 01:08:10.018
It's good, nothing disrupts
the series when I get going.

01:08:10.787 --> 01:08:12.120
Okay.

01:08:12.122 --> 01:08:13.955
♪ Hurts so much, I
can't believe it, ♪

01:08:13.957 --> 01:08:15.857
♪ but I'm gonna
keep on doing it ♪

01:08:15.859 --> 01:08:18.126
♪ because you have
fucking cancer. ♪

01:08:27.104 --> 01:08:30.071
- Yes, yes, more kicks.

01:08:30.073 --> 01:08:31.072
- That?

01:08:31.073 --> 01:08:32.207
What, this old thing?

01:08:32.943 --> 01:08:34.209
This old thing?

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:40.715
Fucking 360 shit.

01:08:40.716 --> 01:08:41.549
Love that.

01:08:50.093 --> 01:08:50.992
You see that shit?

01:08:50.993 --> 01:08:53.495
- I did, I saw it.

01:08:57.667 --> 01:08:58.633
I'm gonna
have an aneurism.

01:09:01.238 --> 01:09:02.504
- It's happy sometimes,

01:09:02.506 --> 01:09:05.305
sometimes I get so
happy when I dance.

01:09:06.743 --> 01:09:07.575
Smooth jams.

01:09:12.616 --> 01:09:13.814
Oh pancake.

01:09:13.817 --> 01:09:16.751
Pancake.

01:09:17.787 --> 01:09:19.787
Mm, babe you're my griddle.

01:09:23.292 --> 01:09:24.658
- No you're so gross.

01:09:24.661 --> 01:09:26.327
Ew, you're sweaty too.

01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:35.870
- Hey Max is worried about you.

01:09:36.872 --> 01:09:38.305
- About the cancer?

01:09:38.308 --> 01:09:39.174
We talked.

01:09:40.944 --> 01:09:44.045
- The cancer, the Dad,

01:09:45.182 --> 01:09:47.015
your reactions to things.

01:09:47.817 --> 01:09:49.551
- Wait, he said this to you?

01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:52.453
- Not in so many words, but...

01:09:52.455 --> 01:09:54.055
- In what kind of words, Drew?

01:09:54.057 --> 01:09:56.191
In his words?

01:09:56.193 --> 01:09:57.525
In your words?

01:09:57.527 --> 01:09:59.527
What kind of words
were said actually?

01:09:59.529 --> 01:10:01.029
- Babe come on,
don't get all...

01:10:01.031 --> 01:10:02.664
- What, what, obsessive?

01:10:02.666 --> 01:10:04.465
Psychotic, violent?

01:10:04.467 --> 01:10:06.334
- No, I didn't say any of that.

01:10:06.336 --> 01:10:08.203
- Hmm, no well I get it though.

01:10:08.205 --> 01:10:09.737
- No, no, you infer it.

01:10:09.739 --> 01:10:12.674
- Well that's how most
feelings are conveyed by men.

01:10:12.676 --> 01:10:15.376
- Well that's how most
women extrapolate or,

01:10:15.378 --> 01:10:17.011
this is ridiculous,
what are we doing?

01:10:17.013 --> 01:10:19.547
- This is fun, Drew,
this is so fun.

01:10:19.549 --> 01:10:21.382
This is what I need right now.

01:10:21.384 --> 01:10:24.786
My dad is checking
out and I have cancer.

01:10:25.855 --> 01:10:27.322
- What, that is so unfair.

01:10:27.324 --> 01:10:28.890
What am I supposed
to do with that, huh?

01:10:28.892 --> 01:10:31.059
That's like the mic
drop of the universe.

01:10:32.862 --> 01:10:34.095
Stop.

01:10:34.097 --> 01:10:35.697
- You stop.

01:10:35.699 --> 01:10:36.564
- Bay.

01:10:38.602 --> 01:10:41.536
- Look I know that
this is the part

01:10:41.538 --> 01:10:43.605
where we're supposed
to kiss and make up

01:10:43.607 --> 01:10:47.442
and it's all fine
again, but I'm mad.

01:10:47.444 --> 01:10:51.679
I'm mad at everything and I
will eventually come up for air

01:10:51.681 --> 01:10:54.649
but right now, mad is working.

01:10:58.788 --> 01:11:01.522
- Well in that case, piss off.

01:11:01.524 --> 01:11:02.824
- Better, better.

01:12:03.753 --> 01:12:05.787
Okay we have balloons, right?

01:12:05.789 --> 01:12:06.654
- Yep.

01:12:08.158 --> 01:12:11.025
- Okay good because Alonzo
is very attached to those.

01:12:14.798 --> 01:12:15.997
Hey are we okay?

01:12:15.999 --> 01:12:18.066
- Yes I'm
just shitting, hon.

01:12:20.603 --> 01:12:21.602
You taking that off the list?

01:12:21.604 --> 01:12:22.437
- Mm-hmm.

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:25.340
- Hon, everything is fine.

01:12:26.309 --> 01:12:27.675
Everything is gonna get handled.

01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:29.577
You just gotta
trust me, alright?

01:12:31.181 --> 01:12:32.714
- Okay.

01:12:32.716 --> 01:12:35.383
Alright so I'm
getting party favors and...

01:12:38.521 --> 01:12:39.887
Oh, oh.

01:12:39.889 --> 01:12:40.755
- What?

01:12:41.891 --> 01:12:44.325
- I still haven't told Scout.

01:12:44.327 --> 01:12:46.361
I mean about the entire surgery.

01:12:47.397 --> 01:12:49.263
I kept waiting, oh my god.

01:12:50.333 --> 01:12:51.199
- Shit, me too.

01:12:53.203 --> 01:12:54.669
- Okay, okay.

01:12:54.671 --> 01:12:56.637
I'm doing it now, I'm
doing it right now.

01:12:56.639 --> 01:12:57.872
Okay this is bullshit.

01:12:59.843 --> 01:13:01.976
Remember when Mommy had Scout

01:13:01.978 --> 01:13:04.712
and I had to go to the
hospital for a couple days

01:13:04.714 --> 01:13:06.948
and you stayed with
Ishi and Pop Pop?

01:13:08.351 --> 01:13:11.652
Well Mommy's got to go
in the hospital again.

01:13:11.654 --> 01:13:13.855
- This was last time
when I was four.

01:13:13.857 --> 01:13:15.723
You were just a baby.

01:13:15.725 --> 01:13:17.425
- Aw look how little you were.

01:13:19.229 --> 01:13:21.028
- A doctor is going
to do something

01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:23.297
called an operation on me.

01:13:26.436 --> 01:13:28.903
No, you're gonna be
at Ishi and Pop Pop's.

01:13:28.905 --> 01:13:30.671
You know how sometimes you
get a school note as a kid?

01:13:30.673 --> 01:13:31.839
- Just listen, okay?

01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:33.941
- Fine.

01:13:36.212 --> 01:13:39.514
- That's what a doctor's gonna
do for Mommy in a hospital.

01:13:39.516 --> 01:13:42.617
A doctor's gonna go in
and get the booby out.

01:13:42.619 --> 01:13:44.752
- The boo boo.
- The boo boo.

01:13:44.754 --> 01:13:46.721
- Why'd you call it a booby?

01:13:46.723 --> 01:13:48.356
- Well the boo
boo is in my booby

01:13:49.426 --> 01:13:51.893
so the doctor is gonna,
you can't see it.

01:13:51.895 --> 01:13:53.561
- Okay.

01:13:53.563 --> 01:13:56.297
- It doesn't show, it's
inside, under my skin.

01:13:57.801 --> 01:13:59.400
- They did an
x-ray and they found

01:13:59.402 --> 01:14:01.636
an ouchie in there.

01:14:01.638 --> 01:14:03.471
- No, no the doctors
are gonna make sure

01:14:03.473 --> 01:14:06.974
Mommy has lots of good
medicine so nothing hurts.

01:14:06.976 --> 01:14:09.911
They're gonna go and they're
gonna get the boo boo out

01:14:09.913 --> 01:14:12.113
and then Mommy's gonna come
home with these bandages on

01:14:12.115 --> 01:14:14.916
and then they're
gonna send me home.

01:14:25.662 --> 01:14:30.264

01:14:30.266 --> 01:14:34.068

01:14:35.939 --> 01:14:36.804
- Yeah.

01:14:40.076 --> 01:14:40.908
You okay?

01:14:54.190 --> 01:14:55.389
- I was just thinking,

01:14:56.125 --> 01:14:59.794
where am I gonna possibly
deposit this pesky boob

01:14:59.796 --> 01:15:01.028
and here we are.

01:15:03.266 --> 01:15:04.198
- You're an idiot.

01:15:05.869 --> 01:15:06.734
I love you.

01:15:08.271 --> 01:15:09.403
- Even all jacked up?

01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:11.205
- Especially.

01:15:12.342 --> 01:15:15.009
It makes you really
need and appreciative.

01:15:18.481 --> 01:15:19.347
Come here.

01:15:30.026 --> 01:15:33.828
- Lucine
to ICU please, Lucine to ICU.

01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:34.962
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:15:36.799 --> 01:15:37.632
- Any word?

01:15:39.502 --> 01:15:41.736
- Doctor came by
about an hour ago

01:15:41.738 --> 01:15:44.405
and said that the uh...

01:15:44.407 --> 01:15:46.240
They checked the lymph
nodes and it hadn't spread,

01:15:46.242 --> 01:15:47.909
so that's good.

01:15:47.911 --> 01:15:49.544
- That's great.
- Yeah.

01:15:51.748 --> 01:15:55.983
- Paging
Dr. Stavis, Dr. Stavis please.

01:15:57.153 --> 01:15:59.554
- They still gotta finish
up the surgery but,

01:15:59.556 --> 01:16:03.324
and biopsy the
tissue but you know,

01:16:03.326 --> 01:16:05.092
just wanna make sure
it's not invasive.

01:16:06.429 --> 01:16:07.895
I sent everyone else home.

01:16:08.998 --> 01:16:10.331
- Okay.

01:16:10.333 --> 01:16:11.866
- What are they gonna do, right?

01:16:11.868 --> 01:16:12.733
- Yeah.

01:16:15.905 --> 01:16:16.771
Are you sure about--

01:16:16.773 --> 01:16:17.638
- Mm-hmm.

01:16:18.608 --> 01:16:19.473
Yes.

01:16:20.777 --> 01:16:21.976
He said he wanted to come.

01:16:23.846 --> 01:16:24.745
I gotta let him.

01:16:24.747 --> 01:16:26.581
- Nah, no you're right.

01:16:26.583 --> 01:16:27.915
You're doing the right thing.

01:16:27.917 --> 01:16:28.916
- Yeah?

01:16:28.918 --> 01:16:29.717
- Yeah.

01:16:33.022 --> 01:16:34.121
You're good.

01:16:40.463 --> 01:16:41.295
Okay.

01:16:41.297 --> 01:16:43.097
- I'll call you.
- Yeah.

01:16:43.099 --> 01:16:44.966
- Thanks for coming by.

01:16:44.968 --> 01:16:45.833
Hey.

01:16:46.936 --> 01:16:47.935
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:16:52.308 --> 01:16:53.174
Look at me.

01:16:56.112 --> 01:16:56.978
Who's this guy?

01:16:59.749 --> 01:17:00.548
Sit down.

01:17:08.057 --> 01:17:10.658
So this is what we
do, we sit here.

01:17:14.163 --> 01:17:15.029
You scared?

01:17:15.932 --> 01:17:17.164
- Yeah.

01:17:17.166 --> 01:17:18.032
- Yeah, me too.

01:17:21.671 --> 01:17:23.204
There's nothing wrong with that.

01:17:27.410 --> 01:17:29.143
You know she's
gonna be fine right?

01:17:31.848 --> 01:17:34.048
And I'm very proud of
you for coming here.

01:17:39.088 --> 01:17:39.887
I love you.

01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:41.856
- I love you.

01:17:57.140 --> 01:18:00.107
- The first step to recovery
is admitting you got a problem.

01:18:01.978 --> 01:18:04.679
- I need one of them
grab, grabber things.

01:18:04.681 --> 01:18:07.114
The grabby, the grab things.

01:18:10.153 --> 01:18:11.519
- A hand?

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:12.886
Ooh, somebody's
got a shiny ladder.

01:18:12.889 --> 01:18:15.222
- Don't even talk to me,
you're a traitor, okay?

01:18:16.693 --> 01:18:19.527
- I got you those
damn balloons, didn't I?

01:18:19.529 --> 01:18:22.163
- You gonna be okay
for a little while?

01:18:26.035 --> 01:18:27.868
Did you OD her?

01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:30.571
- I haven't even
given her today's yet.

01:18:30.573 --> 01:18:31.972
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

01:18:32.975 --> 01:18:34.341
My tongue was numb.

01:18:34.343 --> 01:18:38.345
I said, I have Zo,
do you have the list?

01:18:38.347 --> 01:18:39.980
- Yeah I got the list, okay?

01:18:39.982 --> 01:18:42.183
I got three places to go and
I'm gonna take Lance with me.

01:18:42.185 --> 01:18:44.652
- Wait. Why?

01:18:44.654 --> 01:18:46.153
- It's gonna be fine.

01:18:47.223 --> 01:18:48.656
- Why do you have a ladder?

01:18:48.658 --> 01:18:50.658
- Ooh, maybe he's
just happy to see me.

01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:52.259
- That makes zero sense.

01:18:52.261 --> 01:18:53.327
I need to go to work.

01:18:53.329 --> 01:18:55.830
- Wait, well what
about the kids?

01:18:55.832 --> 01:18:57.264
- Kids are fine, Paula's gonna
pick them up from school,

01:18:57.266 --> 01:18:58.866
we got Marty Poppins here.

01:18:58.868 --> 01:19:02.236
You're gonna be asleep
all or like on Vicodin so,

01:19:02.238 --> 01:19:03.504
I got it, don't worry.

01:19:03.506 --> 01:19:05.005
- Wait, wait no,
you can't got this.

01:19:05.007 --> 01:19:06.207
You can't just got this, okay?

01:19:06.209 --> 01:19:08.943
What if none of
these guys work out?

01:19:08.945 --> 01:19:11.078
We promised Scout
something really special.

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:12.880
She's been talking
about it all week.

01:19:12.882 --> 01:19:15.116
- Honey, I said
I got this, okay?

01:19:16.352 --> 01:19:19.086
- Well you can't just got
this and go out to work.

01:19:19.088 --> 01:19:20.254
You can't double book.

01:19:20.256 --> 01:19:22.389
- Honey, I need to
go to work, okay?

01:19:22.391 --> 01:19:23.457
We need the money right now.

01:19:23.459 --> 01:19:25.092
- We need to take care of Scout.

01:19:25.094 --> 01:19:26.761
- Scout's fine, you're
the one that's kinda--

01:19:26.763 --> 01:19:28.028
- Oh I'm the one, I'm the one.

01:19:28.030 --> 01:19:29.797
Okay it's me, do you see that?

01:19:29.799 --> 01:19:32.266
It's me, it's all
about me and my thing.

01:19:32.268 --> 01:19:36.070
No you, you can't
screw this up, Drew.

01:19:36.072 --> 01:19:37.772
- Yeah I'll try not
to screw it up, okay?

01:19:37.774 --> 01:19:39.039
- Oh my god.

01:19:39.041 --> 01:19:41.242
- I love you, please
take care of her for me.

01:19:41.244 --> 01:19:43.444
- Drew, ouch, you
can't walk out,

01:19:43.446 --> 01:19:45.613
I can't follow you,
that's not fair.

01:19:50.253 --> 01:19:51.118
Shit.

01:19:52.555 --> 01:19:54.655
Shit, shit.

01:19:54.657 --> 01:19:57.124
Shit, shit, shit, ow.

01:19:57.126 --> 01:19:57.992
Shit, ow.

01:19:59.262 --> 01:20:02.229
- Elizabeth Taylor, how's
this working out for you?

01:20:02.231 --> 01:20:04.331
- It's not.

01:20:04.333 --> 01:20:05.800
- Geez.

01:20:05.802 --> 01:20:07.701
- Wait did you just call me fat?

01:20:09.739 --> 01:20:11.005
- Not exactly.

01:20:12.842 --> 01:20:14.275
- Seriously?

01:20:14.277 --> 01:20:19.346
After all of it, after
cancer and Dad and the party

01:20:20.349 --> 01:20:21.949
and no money and whatever?

01:20:21.951 --> 01:20:26.086
I know in my head those
are all gonna be okay.

01:20:27.290 --> 01:20:32.326
That, I can't do that, I
can't do that with him.

01:20:33.596 --> 01:20:36.497
If he and I aren't okay, I
feel like I can't breathe.

01:20:38.668 --> 01:20:43.337
And I'm the one that's making
it not okay for awhile.

01:20:47.343 --> 01:20:49.944
I just can't right now.

01:20:52.648 --> 01:20:53.848
- Stop.

01:20:55.051 --> 01:20:56.984
You need to prioritize.

01:20:56.986 --> 01:21:01.956
You killed the cancer
beast, and you live to tell.

01:21:02.391 --> 01:21:03.290
You're here.

01:21:04.327 --> 01:21:07.361
Now, you're ass got problems but

01:21:08.631 --> 01:21:10.231
they're quality problems.

01:21:11.367 --> 01:21:14.301
Being so in love you
can't fight right?

01:21:15.238 --> 01:21:16.403
Quality problem.

01:21:17.707 --> 01:21:19.240
Ones frankly I wish I had.

01:21:20.243 --> 01:21:21.141
I'd kill for.

01:21:22.078 --> 01:21:24.411
It's a problem, yes.

01:21:24.413 --> 01:21:25.279
But,

01:21:26.549 --> 01:21:28.215
one born out of abundance.

01:21:31.387 --> 01:21:32.253

01:21:33.522 --> 01:21:35.089

- I usually find
magicians creepy.

01:22:23.773 --> 01:22:25.806
- Because they're
touched by gods.

01:22:30.546 --> 01:22:32.479
- Wow.

01:22:32.481 --> 01:22:33.847
- He's kidding, he's kidding.

01:22:35.051 --> 01:22:36.150
- Okay.
- Oh you almost took,

01:22:36.152 --> 01:22:37.484
that's great.
- You got us.

01:22:37.486 --> 01:22:38.452
- Wow rough day?

01:22:38.454 --> 01:22:39.553
- Yeah just a little bit.

01:22:39.555 --> 01:22:40.354
- Three.

01:22:41.657 --> 01:22:42.523
- So.
- So.

01:22:43.926 --> 01:22:46.460
- Okay I get it, you know
I'll just cut to the chase.

01:22:46.462 --> 01:22:47.328
I book magicians,

01:22:49.398 --> 01:22:50.998
myself included.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.934
- So like a traditional
kids birthday party, right?

01:22:53.936 --> 01:22:56.470
- Do you have a dollar or
a bill, any kind of bill?

01:23:13.789 --> 01:23:15.289
Can't explain it can you?

01:23:15.291 --> 01:23:17.391
Neither can I, it's magic.

01:23:20.663 --> 01:23:21.528
Right?

01:23:23.766 --> 01:23:25.933
- Wow.

01:23:25.935 --> 01:23:27.001
You're good.

01:23:27.003 --> 01:23:28.302
- You like that?
- Yeah.

01:23:28.304 --> 01:23:29.203
- That was kinda awesome.
- That was amazing.

01:23:30.506 --> 01:23:31.538
- Saturday, you busy?

01:23:32.541 --> 01:23:34.475
- Uh let me check my, no.

01:23:36.479 --> 01:23:37.478
- Excellent, excellent.

01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:38.779
Stop it.
- Is it dead?

01:23:38.781 --> 01:23:43.851
- Yep, it's dead.
- Dead bird?

01:23:47.023 --> 01:23:47.855
- Clyde.

01:24:03.339 --> 01:24:04.204
Clyde.

01:24:05.641 --> 01:24:06.473
Clyde?

01:24:07.743 --> 01:24:08.809
Clyde!

01:24:10.513 --> 01:24:11.845
- Get off me!

01:24:11.847 --> 01:24:13.580
- Okay, it's okay, it's
okay, it's okay, it's okay.

01:24:13.582 --> 01:24:14.381
- Who are you?

01:24:14.383 --> 01:24:15.582
- I'm Drew, I'm Drew.

01:24:15.584 --> 01:24:16.383
- I don't know you.

01:24:16.385 --> 01:24:18.018
- Yes, yeah you do.

01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:19.353
I'm your son-in-law,

01:24:19.355 --> 01:24:20.554
Bailey's husband.
- Get out of here.

01:24:20.556 --> 01:24:21.355
How'd you get in here?

01:24:21.357 --> 01:24:23.357
- Keys, I have keys.

01:24:23.359 --> 01:24:24.091
Hold on, look.

01:24:24.093 --> 01:24:25.159
- Keys?
- Yeah.

01:24:27.229 --> 01:24:28.529
Okay, can I show you?

01:24:28.531 --> 01:24:30.064
- What?
- I got a picture.

01:24:32.568 --> 01:24:33.934
You hit your head, okay?

01:24:33.936 --> 01:24:34.802
Sit down.

01:24:35.771 --> 01:24:37.071
I'm showing you right here.

01:24:37.073 --> 01:24:39.606
You know me, we
are friends, okay?

01:24:42.111 --> 01:24:43.677
Who's that?

01:24:43.679 --> 01:24:44.578
Little...

01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:45.946
- That's little fish, yeah.

01:24:45.948 --> 01:24:48.248
And then the kids.
- Then the kids.

01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:49.450
- Who's--
- That guy.

01:24:51.287 --> 01:24:52.086
- Hi.

01:24:52.088 --> 01:24:53.220
- How you doing bud?

01:24:53.222 --> 01:24:54.021
- Hit my head.

01:24:54.023 --> 01:24:55.522
- I know.

01:24:55.524 --> 01:24:56.590
So I'm gonna get you
an ice pack, okay?

01:24:56.592 --> 01:24:58.292
- It hurts.
- I know.

01:24:58.294 --> 01:24:59.259
- Yes.
- Okay.

01:24:59.261 --> 01:25:00.527
We're good right?

01:25:00.529 --> 01:25:02.596
- Yes we are thank you.
- You sure?

01:25:02.598 --> 01:25:03.464
- Okay.

01:25:06.735 --> 01:25:08.869
- Your resume looks amazing.

01:25:08.871 --> 01:25:10.637
Thank you.

01:25:10.639 --> 01:25:12.272
You know, let me, let me.

01:25:12.274 --> 01:25:13.340
- Thank you.

01:25:19.615 --> 01:25:20.481
Hello you.

01:25:23.652 --> 01:25:24.518
Is he okay?

01:25:26.422 --> 01:25:27.287
I'm coming over.

01:25:35.097 --> 01:25:36.630
- Well Clyde's doing better.

01:25:37.967 --> 01:25:39.633
Everyone's getting
dressed right now.

01:25:40.970 --> 01:25:42.636
Are you sure you're okay
watching them for a little bit?

01:25:42.638 --> 01:25:45.339
- Sure, it'll give us time
to get to know each other.

01:25:45.341 --> 01:25:46.573
- Thank you.

01:25:46.575 --> 01:25:48.342
What is that?

01:25:48.344 --> 01:25:50.110
- Goo, it's awesome.

01:25:50.112 --> 01:25:52.579
- Yeah, you gotta touch
it, it's super cool.

01:25:52.581 --> 01:25:54.648
- It's just
cornstarch and water.

01:25:54.650 --> 01:25:55.849
- Seriously, do it.
- I figured it'd keep us

01:25:55.851 --> 01:25:57.584
busy for a bit.

01:25:57.586 --> 01:25:58.685
- Ew.

01:26:03.159 --> 01:26:05.125
- I have three nieces
and two nephews so

01:26:05.127 --> 01:26:07.528
you learn to rely on
the little things.

01:26:07.530 --> 01:26:09.596
Kid love their messes.

01:26:13.602 --> 01:26:17.004
- Hey, you're not by chance
a serial killer are you?

01:26:17.006 --> 01:26:17.871
- No.

01:26:18.474 --> 01:26:19.940
- You a klepto?

01:26:19.942 --> 01:26:21.008
- No.

01:26:21.010 --> 01:26:22.676
- What about a cult member?

01:26:22.678 --> 01:26:23.510
- No.

01:26:24.713 --> 01:26:25.546
- Well you're hired.

01:26:27.183 --> 01:26:28.048
- Thank you.

01:26:29.518 --> 01:26:33.687
But I only think I can help
you in a limited capacity.

01:26:34.890 --> 01:26:38.125
Your father-in-law,
he needs more.

01:26:39.461 --> 01:26:41.962
He's getting to a point
where it's dangerous

01:26:41.964 --> 01:26:43.730
for him to be on his own.

01:26:44.867 --> 01:26:46.733
He's going to need
assisted living,

01:26:46.735 --> 01:26:48.402
and sooner rather than later.

01:26:50.239 --> 01:26:52.372
- Bailey's gonna be
a tough sell on that.

01:26:53.209 --> 01:26:54.875
- It's not surprising.

01:26:54.877 --> 01:26:56.910
She's a very strong woman.

01:26:56.912 --> 01:26:58.545
I speak from experience.

01:27:02.751 --> 01:27:05.719
The thing about being strong
is that when you do that,

01:27:05.721 --> 01:27:07.588
you are that for long enough

01:27:07.590 --> 01:27:09.990
and you begin to
forget how to stop.

01:27:11.594 --> 01:27:14.595
The really strong
ones, they're the ones

01:27:14.597 --> 01:27:17.431
that can let themselves
break a little,

01:27:18.701 --> 01:27:20.634
just enough so someone
can help mend them.

01:27:22.538 --> 01:27:25.072
You just wait for that break.

01:27:48.797 --> 01:27:49.796
- You okay?

01:28:04.246 --> 01:28:05.679
Just gonna be gentle.

01:28:10.886 --> 01:28:12.019
Does it hurt?

01:28:27.102 --> 01:28:27.968
It's okay?

01:28:35.911 --> 01:28:36.743
That hurt?

01:28:47.656 --> 01:28:50.290
It's really good.

01:28:50.292 --> 01:28:53.260
She did a really good job.

01:28:53.262 --> 01:28:54.161
Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:28:54.163 --> 01:28:56.863
- No she did a really good job.

01:28:57.933 --> 01:28:58.765
- Okay.

01:29:01.437 --> 01:29:03.370
- You're gonna like it.

01:29:04.473 --> 01:29:06.206
- Okay.

01:29:06.208 --> 01:29:07.874
- I love you.

01:29:09.044 --> 01:29:10.243
- I love you.

01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:25.926
Okay.

01:29:30.866 --> 01:29:31.732
Okay.

01:29:45.514 --> 01:29:50.183
- You're back.

01:29:59.328 --> 01:30:01.294
- So the food is done

01:30:02.197 --> 01:30:03.764
and the cake is...

01:30:03.766 --> 01:30:04.831
- In the fridge.

01:30:04.833 --> 01:30:06.566
Lance picked it up
on the way over.

01:30:06.568 --> 01:30:09.236
- Oh Lance is doing
the creeper thing.

01:30:09.238 --> 01:30:10.036
- You're kidding me.

01:30:10.038 --> 01:30:11.705
- Yeah, can you stop it?

01:30:11.707 --> 01:30:12.606
- Lance?

01:30:12.608 --> 01:30:15.108
- Hey what's up beautiful lady?

01:30:15.110 --> 01:30:15.909
I see you.

01:30:15.911 --> 01:30:17.244
What?

01:30:17.246 --> 01:30:19.079
- Dude, you have to stop
hitting on all the moms.

01:30:19.081 --> 01:30:20.580
- I'm not doing that.

01:30:20.582 --> 01:30:21.915
- You totally are.

01:30:21.917 --> 01:30:23.917
They're all married,
they all have kids,

01:30:23.919 --> 01:30:25.719
and you're kind of
freaking them out.

01:30:25.721 --> 01:30:26.953
- Okay fine.

01:30:26.955 --> 01:30:28.221
Alright?

01:30:28.223 --> 01:30:30.357
Hey didn't I see you
at the sandbox earlier?

01:30:30.359 --> 01:30:31.892
- We're completely here.

01:30:31.894 --> 01:30:32.926
I don't know.

01:30:32.928 --> 01:30:34.027
- That was you.

01:30:34.029 --> 01:30:35.195
- Oh my god,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:30:35.197 --> 01:30:36.696
- Are you kidding me?
- What?

01:30:36.698 --> 01:30:38.799
- Just there.
- We had a moment earlier.

01:30:38.801 --> 01:30:40.200
- Do me a favor.
- You weren't there.

01:30:40.202 --> 01:30:42.369
- Lance, go watch
the trampoline, okay?

01:30:42.371 --> 01:30:43.937
There's like 10 kids in
there, you're in charge.

01:30:43.939 --> 01:30:45.272
That's your zone, yeah.
- Right now?

01:30:45.274 --> 01:30:46.573
Cool, six!

01:30:46.575 --> 01:30:48.108
- Yeah,
you got a mission.

01:30:48.110 --> 01:30:52.946
- So in 30 minutes, the
pizza, then kid activities,

01:30:52.948 --> 01:30:56.249
then at one p.m., Frank.

01:30:56.251 --> 01:30:57.384
- Hap.
- Hap.

01:30:57.386 --> 01:30:58.752
- Yeah, it's 1:30.

01:30:58.754 --> 01:31:00.654
- Hap at 1:30

01:31:00.656 --> 01:31:02.889
and his magical parades.

01:31:02.891 --> 01:31:04.791
- Yes, way to go with the flow.

01:31:04.793 --> 01:31:08.328
- Going with the flow is
kid party suicide, okay?

01:31:08.330 --> 01:31:11.231
Parents all get trapped
waiting on the cake

01:31:11.233 --> 01:31:13.767
and you don't hold
your guests hostage.

01:31:13.769 --> 01:31:15.435
- Okay, honey?
- Yes.

01:31:15.437 --> 01:31:16.903
- I got this.

01:31:16.905 --> 01:31:18.738
- You do got this.

01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:21.808
So freaking cute.

01:31:21.810 --> 01:31:25.111
Just making little
checks on my list.

01:31:25.113 --> 01:31:28.148
Plus pretty sure I
double dosed my Vicodin.

01:31:28.150 --> 01:31:29.449
- You're kidding me.

01:31:29.451 --> 01:31:31.785
- Woo!

01:31:31.787 --> 01:31:32.819
- That explains a lot.

01:31:32.821 --> 01:31:35.021
- Maybe, or maybe not.

01:31:38.961 --> 01:31:39.993
- Love you.

01:31:39.995 --> 01:31:40.861
- I love you.

01:31:44.199 --> 01:31:45.065
Bubbles.

01:31:47.870 --> 01:31:48.869
Oh.

01:31:53.976 --> 01:31:56.510
- Nope, absolutely
not, sit down.

01:31:57.613 --> 01:31:58.378
Scoutie!

01:31:58.380 --> 01:31:59.246
Come here.

01:32:03.051 --> 01:32:04.351
- So everybody's good?

01:32:04.353 --> 01:32:06.052
- Yep, all good.

01:32:06.054 --> 01:32:07.120
- Okay.

01:32:07.122 --> 01:32:08.955
- Don't worry Mom,
Dad's got this.

01:32:08.957 --> 01:32:10.624
- Yeah he does, baby.

01:32:12.060 --> 01:32:15.128
- When's the bunny guy coming?

01:32:15.130 --> 01:32:20.200
- Bunny guy is soon.

01:32:21.036 --> 01:32:21.968
- Hey you know what?

01:32:21.970 --> 01:32:23.003
Why don't you go get a brush

01:32:23.005 --> 01:32:25.138
and I will give
you some cornrows.

01:32:25.140 --> 01:32:26.873
- Okay.

01:32:26.875 --> 01:32:27.741
- Awesome.

01:32:31.246 --> 01:32:32.379
You

01:32:33.248 --> 01:32:34.514
are on a shitload
of drugs right now.

01:32:36.351 --> 01:32:38.184
- Okay, define shitload.

01:32:41.089 --> 01:32:42.088
- Alan?

01:32:42.090 --> 01:32:43.356
Alan.

01:32:43.358 --> 01:32:45.225
Can you come inside for
a little bit please?

01:32:47.996 --> 01:32:49.329
- Well it's all I can see.

01:32:50.532 --> 01:32:51.598
It's bizarro.

01:32:53.201 --> 01:32:54.067
- Hey.

01:33:01.944 --> 01:33:04.044
- Who is that?

01:33:04.046 --> 01:33:05.245
- I have no idea.

01:33:07.683 --> 01:33:08.815
- Holy shit.

01:33:11.219 --> 01:33:12.786
- I don't, it might
have been like

01:33:12.788 --> 01:33:14.454
a language barrier or
something, I don't get it.

01:33:14.456 --> 01:33:15.722
- That's an edible nightmare.

01:33:15.724 --> 01:33:17.424
- No, I need some
solutions here, okay?

01:33:17.426 --> 01:33:18.224
Work with me.

01:33:18.226 --> 01:33:19.926
- Wow, is this blood?

01:33:19.928 --> 01:33:21.528
- I don't know.

01:33:21.530 --> 01:33:23.430
You know, maybe
it's not that bad.

01:33:23.432 --> 01:33:25.565
- Come on, man.

01:33:25.567 --> 01:33:27.467
Dude if you take that out
there, you're getting divorced.

01:33:27.469 --> 01:33:28.335
- Okay, I get it.

01:33:33.241 --> 01:33:34.107
Hello?

01:33:35.410 --> 01:33:37.043
Um yeah, Hap.

01:33:37.045 --> 01:33:38.311
Hey, what's up? Yeah.

01:33:40.048 --> 01:33:42.115
Uh, wait, no.

01:33:42.117 --> 01:33:43.216
No, no Hap.

01:33:44.753 --> 01:33:47.787
You get off the freeway and
you take side streets, okay?

01:33:48.724 --> 01:33:50.557
Hap, Hap.

01:33:50.559 --> 01:33:51.391
Hello?

01:33:53.595 --> 01:33:55.095
Uh, something.

01:33:55.097 --> 01:33:55.962
- Okay.

01:34:08.176 --> 01:34:09.142
- Uh hey babe?

01:34:09.144 --> 01:34:10.744
- Yeah.

01:34:10.746 --> 01:34:12.946
- We might have
a slight problem.

01:34:12.948 --> 01:34:15.148
Hap, the magician that we hired.

01:34:16.418 --> 01:34:19.252
Well he was on the 118 and
there's an oil spill there

01:34:19.254 --> 01:34:23.857
and there's not a chance in
hell he's gonna make it today.

01:34:23.859 --> 01:34:25.992
Okay?

01:34:27.162 --> 01:34:30.630
So that's what it is but I think
everything's gonna be fine.

01:34:34.036 --> 01:34:35.602
- Okay.

01:34:35.604 --> 01:34:36.770
- Because you know what?

01:34:36.772 --> 01:34:39.472
I got this.
- You got this, yes.

01:34:39.474 --> 01:34:43.043
I do think that you got this.

01:34:43.045 --> 01:34:48.114
I do, I do, I seriously want
you to got this but, um,

01:34:49.017 --> 01:34:50.383
you know, now would
be about the time

01:34:50.385 --> 01:34:53.219
that you would go
about getting it.

01:34:53.221 --> 01:34:55.388
- The cake.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:34:55.390 --> 01:34:59.192
Also my Dad is locked
in the bathroom

01:34:59.194 --> 01:35:00.960
because he can't
find his guitar.

01:35:02.230 --> 01:35:04.464
He's freaking out a little bit

01:35:04.466 --> 01:35:08.134
and nobody knows that
there's a cake so

01:35:08.136 --> 01:35:13.206
these would all fall under
the getting this category.

01:35:13.875 --> 01:35:15.208
- I got it.

01:35:15.210 --> 01:35:18.978
- Awesome, I love you, okay.
- Love you.

01:35:25.420 --> 01:35:26.753
- Drew?
- Yeah?

01:35:26.755 --> 01:35:28.822
- Is there anything
I can help you with?

01:35:28.824 --> 01:35:29.856
- No, no.

01:35:29.858 --> 01:35:31.124
Yes, actually.

01:35:32.394 --> 01:35:35.762
Can you help Bailey,
or actually help Clyde.

01:35:35.764 --> 01:35:39.065
Go find Clyde and just
take care of him, okay?

01:35:39.067 --> 01:35:40.834
Thank you.

01:35:42.437 --> 01:35:43.303
- What?

01:35:53.248 --> 01:35:55.215
- I thought cancer was
supposed to soften you.

01:35:55.217 --> 01:35:56.282
- Three second rule.

01:35:57.586 --> 01:36:00.086
- How many burpees
in a cupcake, Helene?

01:36:03.258 --> 01:36:04.090
- Excuse me.

01:36:06.962 --> 01:36:07.827
Sorry.

01:36:13.368 --> 01:36:14.367
- Close the door,

01:36:14.369 --> 01:36:15.568
close the door,
- Alright,

01:36:15.570 --> 01:36:17.270
where is it?
- Close the door.

01:36:17.272 --> 01:36:18.905
- Look better?

01:36:18.907 --> 01:36:21.374
- No, mm-mm, no.

01:36:22.277 --> 01:36:23.643
What the hell is that?

01:36:23.645 --> 01:36:25.111
- I think it's a chupacabra.

01:36:26.715 --> 01:36:28.381
A vampire goat killer.

01:36:28.383 --> 01:36:30.383
- I can't, I
can't even look at that.

01:36:30.385 --> 01:36:32.051
- Okay I got a plan.

01:36:32.053 --> 01:36:33.286
- What?
- Go get me some cornstarch.

01:36:33.288 --> 01:36:34.487
- How much?

01:36:34.489 --> 01:36:35.421
- All the cornstarch
you can find.

01:36:35.423 --> 01:36:36.289
- Okay.

01:36:38.894 --> 01:36:39.959
- What do you want me to do?

01:36:41.129 --> 01:36:43.263
- I want you to go out there
and entertain the kids.

01:36:43.265 --> 01:36:45.231
I want you to
entertain this party.

01:36:47.135 --> 01:36:48.434
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

01:36:48.436 --> 01:36:50.937
- You're not messing with me?
- Not messing with you.

01:36:50.939 --> 01:36:51.738
- I get to do this?

01:36:51.740 --> 01:36:53.072
- You get to do this.

01:36:53.074 --> 01:36:54.741
- This is my show.
- You can go out--

01:36:54.743 --> 01:36:56.075
- It's a one man show.

01:36:56.077 --> 01:36:57.677
- It's pivotal, it's the role.
- Can I dance?

01:36:57.679 --> 01:36:59.112
- Yes.
- Can I do the dance party?

01:36:59.114 --> 01:37:00.346
- Yeah, yeah.
- Can I make fart noises?

01:37:00.348 --> 01:37:01.147
- Yeah, okay.
- Just a little

01:37:02.184 --> 01:37:03.249
- Sure.

01:37:03.251 --> 01:37:05.785
- Seven.
- Seven, Lance, it's seven.

01:37:05.787 --> 01:37:07.253
- I got this.
- You got this.

01:37:07.255 --> 01:37:09.022
- For you man.
- Okay, can we go now?

01:37:09.024 --> 01:37:11.191
- Going right now, doing it.

01:37:11.193 --> 01:37:12.659
You watch, just watch,

01:37:13.428 --> 01:37:16.529
- Oh my god.

01:37:16.531 --> 01:37:18.264
- How do you lose
a freaking guitar?

01:37:18.266 --> 01:37:19.632
I mean it's not like a goddamn

01:37:19.634 --> 01:37:20.533
earring, right?
- I don't know,

01:37:20.535 --> 01:37:22.001
but you know what, I got this

01:37:22.003 --> 01:37:23.670
because you keep
checking the same drawer.

01:37:23.672 --> 01:37:25.638
- Well that's just stupid.

01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:29.342
- Yeah, why don't you
let me handle this?

01:37:29.344 --> 01:37:31.377
- No, no, no.

01:37:31.379 --> 01:37:32.178
I...

01:37:33.381 --> 01:37:35.014
I can't take care of my kids,

01:37:35.016 --> 01:37:37.217
I can't throw a goddamn party,

01:37:37.219 --> 01:37:39.219
I sure as shit
can't cure cancer,

01:37:40.355 --> 01:37:42.288
and my dad's losing
his freakin' mind.

01:37:43.792 --> 01:37:44.624
- Mom?

01:37:46.394 --> 01:37:47.360
- Oh, baby.

01:37:49.231 --> 01:37:53.132
God.

01:37:53.134 --> 01:37:55.702
Come here baby, come here.

01:37:58.406 --> 01:38:01.975
You know how sometimes when
you're super frustrated

01:38:01.977 --> 01:38:04.077
and you just wanna scream?

01:38:04.079 --> 01:38:05.311
- Mm-hmm.

01:38:05.313 --> 01:38:07.347
- Well Mommy gets that

01:38:07.349 --> 01:38:08.548
a lot.
- Really?

01:38:11.820 --> 01:38:14.153
- And you wanna know what I do?

01:38:14.155 --> 01:38:15.355
- What?

01:38:15.357 --> 01:38:17.090
- It's super secret.

01:38:17.092 --> 01:38:18.491
Just between us, okay?

01:38:31.406 --> 01:38:33.539
So much better.

01:38:33.541 --> 01:38:34.574
You wanna do it?

01:38:34.576 --> 01:38:37.443
You're gonna do it? Okay.

01:38:37.445 --> 01:38:39.779
- Me?
- Yeah, rock it, ready?

01:38:46.254 --> 01:38:48.187
- Nice, that was good style.

01:38:49.925 --> 01:38:51.457
You feel better?
- Yeah.

01:38:51.459 --> 01:38:53.092
- Me too.

01:38:53.094 --> 01:38:54.928
- Uh, is the magic guy here yet?

01:38:56.464 --> 01:38:57.530
- Oh baby.

01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:00.433
- There you are.

01:39:00.435 --> 01:39:01.968
Hey do you wanna help
me out with something?

01:39:01.970 --> 01:39:03.503
- But what about the bunny guy?

01:39:04.973 --> 01:39:06.372
- I can't even think about that

01:39:06.374 --> 01:39:08.875
because I got a secret mission
for you, if you wanna do it.

01:39:08.877 --> 01:39:09.776
- Okay.
- Yeah?

01:39:09.778 --> 01:39:11.477
No, I'm not gonna let you do it.

01:39:11.479 --> 01:39:12.278
- No.

01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:13.146
- Come on let's go.

01:39:13.148 --> 01:39:15.148
Okay.

01:39:17.319 --> 01:39:18.484
- Dad's got this!

01:39:22.791 --> 01:39:25.224
- Bailey, your
dad's totally fine.

01:39:25.226 --> 01:39:26.426
He had a little accident

01:39:26.428 --> 01:39:28.294
but I borrowed a
pair of Drew's pants.

01:39:28.296 --> 01:39:29.629
He's asking for you right now.

01:39:29.631 --> 01:39:32.498
Do you want me to stay and help?

01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:33.733
- No, I got this.

01:39:33.735 --> 01:39:35.501
Thank you so much.

01:39:48.316 --> 01:39:49.949
- What's up!

01:39:49.951 --> 01:39:50.883
Are we having fun?

01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:53.152
Isn't this the best birthday

01:39:53.154 --> 01:39:54.821
you've ever been
to in your life?

01:39:55.590 --> 01:39:56.656
Come on!

01:39:56.658 --> 01:39:58.257
Do a little of this.

01:39:58.259 --> 01:40:00.994
And there's a little
disco, little disco.

01:40:00.996 --> 01:40:02.996
Like Sabbalo The
Buffalo, nothing.

01:40:02.998 --> 01:40:04.130
Do the crazy dance!

01:40:04.132 --> 01:40:05.865
See how much fun this is?

01:40:05.867 --> 01:40:06.666
Whoa!

01:40:28.456 --> 01:40:31.657
- I'm so embarrassed.

01:40:31.659 --> 01:40:34.327
- Can I tell you
something though?

01:40:34.329 --> 01:40:36.696
I pee my pants
every time I sneeze.

01:40:38.366 --> 01:40:40.566
Seriously.

01:40:40.568 --> 01:40:43.569
It's like standard
practice around here.

01:40:43.571 --> 01:40:45.538
Drew does it just for fun.

01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:46.406
- Oh.

01:40:51.179 --> 01:40:52.378
- I love you, Pop.

01:40:54.082 --> 01:40:56.482
- I love you too, little fish.

01:40:58.653 --> 01:41:02.155
- Yeah.

01:41:02.724 --> 01:41:04.123
- Okay, cool, cool, cool.

01:41:05.593 --> 01:41:08.594
I need you to, that's good,
that's good, that's good.

01:41:08.596 --> 01:41:11.030
Zo, I want you to bring the
goo and also grab the cake.

01:41:11.032 --> 01:41:11.931
- The creepy cake?

01:41:11.933 --> 01:41:13.332
- No, not the creepy cake.

01:41:13.334 --> 01:41:16.235
The perfect,
perfect cake, right?

01:41:16.237 --> 01:41:19.505
The perfectly great cake
that we have, yeah, okay.

01:41:19.507 --> 01:41:21.607
And honey I got a little surprise
for you my little genius,

01:41:21.609 --> 01:41:22.909
come on let's go.

01:41:22.911 --> 01:41:24.844
Uh oh, uh oh, slimy hand.

01:41:26.414 --> 01:41:27.280
- Oh boy.

01:41:30.952 --> 01:41:32.518
- Yes and that is the
comedy portion of our party.

01:41:35.557 --> 01:41:36.889
- Thank you guys,

01:41:36.891 --> 01:41:39.592
you've been the best audience
I've ever had in my life!

01:41:39.594 --> 01:41:42.628
- Now we're gonna get messy!

01:41:42.630 --> 01:41:43.930
- Yeah!

01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:47.300
- This is gooey.

01:41:49.137 --> 01:41:50.470
You know what?
