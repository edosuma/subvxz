02:50.921 --> 02:52.922
Help me!

02:53.006 --> 02:55.424
Somebody, help me out.

02:56.593 --> 02:59.262
Somebody, help me over here!

03:08.272 --> 03:10.982
Somebody, help me out!

03:12.401 --> 03:14.110
Oh, my God!

03:28.292 --> 03:31.168
Walt! Walt!

03:31.253 --> 03:34.463
Stay away from the gas! Stay there!

03:44.141 --> 03:48.853
Help! Help! Somebody, help me!

03:56.820 --> 03:59.488
Oh, my leg!

04:03.660 --> 04:06.120
Hey, get over here.
Give me a hand.

04:06.204 --> 04:09.707
You, come on!
Come over here! Give me a hand!

04:09.791 --> 04:11.709
On the count of three.

04:11.793 --> 04:15.546
One, two, three!

04:31.480 --> 04:35.358
Help! Please, help me!

04:35.442 --> 04:37.777
Help me! Please, help me!

04:39.696 --> 04:42.573
Get him out of here.
Get him away from the engine.

04:42.658 --> 04:44.825
Get him out of here.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.957
Help me!

04:51.041 --> 04:53.626
Please, help me.
I'm having contractions!

04:53.710 --> 04:56.754
- How many months pregnant are you?
- Only eight months.

04:56.838 --> 05:00.257
- How far apart are they coming?
- I don't know, a few just happened!

05:02.135 --> 05:05.012
Hey! Get away from there!

05:17.484 --> 05:20.403
Listen to me! Look at me!
You're gonna be OK.

05:20.487 --> 05:24.407
Do you understand me?
But you have to sit absolutely still.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.579
Hey! You! Come here!

05:30.664 --> 05:34.166
I need you to get this woman away
from these fumes. Take her there.

05:34.251 --> 05:38.170
Stay with her. If her contractions occur
closer than three minutes, call me!

05:38.255 --> 05:40.673
- You gotta be kidding me.
- I'll be right back.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.842
Thank you.

05:42.926 --> 05:45.469
Hey! What's your name?

05:46.430 --> 05:48.180
Jack!

05:49.725 --> 05:53.519
Stop! Her head's not tilted back enough.
You're blowing into her stomach.

05:53.603 --> 05:58.190
You sure? That's exactly what I was
doing. I'm a lifeguard. I'm licensed.

05:58.275 --> 06:01.277
You need to think about
giving that license back.

06:01.361 --> 06:05.698
Maybe we should do one of those hole
things. Stick the pen in the throat?

06:05.782 --> 06:08.993
Yeah, good idea. You go get me a pen.

06:11.747 --> 06:14.707
Does anyone have any pens?
Do you have a pen?

06:14.791 --> 06:16.917
- Does anybody have a pen?
- Come on!

06:18.295 --> 06:20.046
Come on!

06:20.464 --> 06:23.591
Come on! Come on!

06:29.222 --> 06:31.182
Big deep breaths. Deep breaths.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.950
Move! Move! Move!

06:50.035 --> 06:51.994
Get her up! Get her out of there!

07:16.520 --> 07:19.605
- You OK?
- Yeah. Yeah.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.774
You?

07:21.858 --> 07:25.402
- Stay with her.
- Dude, I'm not going anywhere.

08:15.328 --> 08:18.038
I didn't know
which one would work best.

08:25.255 --> 08:28.716
They're all good. Thanks.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.899
Excuse me.

10:11.778 --> 10:14.363
Did you ever use a needle?

10:15.323 --> 10:19.410
- What?
- Did you ever patch a pair of jeans?

10:22.956 --> 10:24.832
I...

10:25.875 --> 10:29.753
- I made the drapes in my apartment.
- That's fantastic. Listen...

10:29.838 --> 10:33.215
Do you have a second?
I could use a little help here.

10:38.054 --> 10:40.222
Help with what?

10:40.307 --> 10:43.767
This. I'd do it myself,
I'm a doctor, but I just can't reach it.

10:43.852 --> 10:46.103
- You want me to sew that?
- Like the drapes.

10:46.187 --> 10:50.149
- With drapes, I use a sewing machine.
- No, you can do this, I'm telling you.

10:50.233 --> 10:52.109
If you wouldn't mind.

10:59.409 --> 11:02.786
- Of course I will.
- Thank you.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.460
It's for your hand.

11:12.088 --> 11:16.258
Save me some... for the wound.

11:21.306 --> 11:23.140
Any color preference?

11:25.101 --> 11:28.520
No. Standard black.

12:36.464 --> 12:38.549
Come on.

12:44.305 --> 12:46.306
Hey, you!

12:46.391 --> 12:49.435
- What's your name?
- Me? Charlie.

12:49.519 --> 12:53.439
Charlie, we need help with the fire.
No one will see it if it isn't big.

12:53.523 --> 12:56.275
- OK, I'm on it. What's your name?
- Sayid.

12:56.359 --> 12:59.153
Sayid. I'm on it, Sayid.

13:10.373 --> 13:13.292
I might throw up on you.

13:13.376 --> 13:15.461
You're doing fine.

13:19.007 --> 13:21.008
You don't seem afraid at all.

13:22.385 --> 13:24.052
I don't understand that.

13:24.971 --> 13:28.682
Well, fear's sort of an odd thing.

13:32.437 --> 13:36.565
When I was in residency,
my first solo procedure

13:36.649 --> 13:42.029
was a spinal surgery
on a 16-year-old kid. A girl.

13:42.739 --> 13:48.368
And at the end, after 13 hours,
I was closing her up and I...

13:49.204 --> 13:51.955
I accidentally ripped her dural sack.

13:52.040 --> 13:55.417
It's at the base of the spine
where all the nerves come together.

13:55.502 --> 13:58.754
Membrane as thin as tissue, and...

13:58.838 --> 14:01.590
So it ripped open.

14:03.009 --> 14:07.221
Nerves just spilled
out of her like angel hair pasta,

14:07.305 --> 14:10.349
spinal fluid flowing
out of her and I...

14:16.189 --> 14:18.732
The terror was just so...

14:19.192 --> 14:23.445
...crazy, so real...

14:24.781 --> 14:27.783
...and I knew I had to deal with it.

14:28.952 --> 14:32.037
So I just made a choice.

14:32.121 --> 14:36.166
I'd let the fear in.
Let it take over. Let it do its thing.

14:36.251 --> 14:40.045
But only for five seconds,
that's all I was gonna give it.

14:40.129 --> 14:42.339
So I started to count.

14:42.423 --> 14:45.384
One, two,

14:45.468 --> 14:50.347
three, four, five.

14:52.809 --> 14:54.434
And it was gone.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.856
I went back to work,
sewed her up and she was fine.

15:01.859 --> 15:06.113
If that had been me I think
I would've run for the door.

15:07.865 --> 15:10.659
No, I don't think that's true.

15:12.161 --> 15:14.830
You're not running now.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.599
You think they
would have come by now.

15:35.476 --> 15:38.645
- Who?
- Anyone.

15:58.708 --> 16:01.543
As if I'm gonna start eating chocolate.

16:04.172 --> 16:08.634
- Shannon, we may be here for a while.
- The plane had a black box, idiot.

16:08.718 --> 16:12.596
They know exactly where we are,
they're coming.

16:14.390 --> 16:21.271
I'll eat on the rescue boat.

16:31.699 --> 16:35.911
- Hungry?
- Yeah. Thanks.

16:37.497 --> 16:41.833
Any more... you know, baby stuff?

16:41.918 --> 16:45.879
No... I'm OK.

16:48.383 --> 16:53.595
- Well, hang in there.
- Yeah, you too.

17:05.273 --> 17:07.943
You sure you're warm enough?

17:48.067 --> 17:50.527
Do you think he's gonna live?

17:54.657 --> 17:57.033
Do you know him?

17:57.744 --> 18:00.746
He was sitting next to me.

18:08.129 --> 18:13.091
We must've been at about
40,000 feet when it happened.

18:13.176 --> 18:16.303
We hit an air pocket and dropped...

18:16.387 --> 18:19.681
...maybe 200 feet.

18:20.475 --> 18:23.018
The turbulence was...

18:27.565 --> 18:29.816
I blacked out.

18:31.694 --> 18:34.029
I didn't.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.573
I saw the whole thing.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.955
I knew that the tail was gone, but I...

18:44.040 --> 18:47.292
...couldn't bring myself to look back.

18:48.294 --> 18:52.255
And then the front end
of the plane broke off.

18:55.384 --> 18:58.053
Well, it's not here on the beach.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.513
Neither is the tail.

19:02.099 --> 19:04.309
We need to figure out
which way we came in.

19:04.393 --> 19:07.312
- Why?
- There's a chance we find the cockpit.

19:07.396 --> 19:10.398
If it's intact, we might be able
to find the transceiver.

19:10.483 --> 19:13.527
We could send out a signal,
help the rescue party find us.

19:13.611 --> 19:16.112
How do you know all that?

19:17.198 --> 19:19.741
Took a couple of flying lessons.

19:21.577 --> 19:23.578
Wasn't for me.

19:26.582 --> 19:29.459
I saw some smoke...

19:29.544 --> 19:31.878
...just through the valley.

19:35.466 --> 19:39.094
If you're thinking about going
for the cockpit, I'm going with you.

19:47.645 --> 19:49.813
I don't know your name.

19:53.359 --> 19:55.360
I'm Kate.

19:55.653 --> 19:57.654
Jack.

20:13.963 --> 20:16.298
What was that?

20:19.677 --> 20:23.096
- That was weird, right?
- Is that Vincent?

20:23.180 --> 20:25.265
It's not Vincent.

20:29.312 --> 20:31.438
Did anybody see that?

20:33.482 --> 20:35.442
Yeah.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.695
Boone!

21:10.728 --> 21:13.063
Terrific.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.830
So, how's the drink?

21:32.667 --> 21:36.086
- It's good.
- That wasn't a very strong reaction.

21:36.170 --> 21:39.047
Well, it's not a very strong drink.

21:43.052 --> 21:45.053
Just don't tell anyone.

21:45.137 --> 21:48.390
This, of course, breaks some
critical FAA regulations.

22:19.213 --> 22:21.214
Excuse me.

22:21.841 --> 22:25.635
- Sir, excuse me!
- Guess he really had to go.

22:25.720 --> 22:27.929
Sir, excuse me!

22:39.900 --> 22:44.029
Ladies and gentleman, the pilot has
switched on the "fasten seatbelts" sign.

22:44.113 --> 22:47.699
Please return to your seats
and fasten your seatbelts.

22:47.783 --> 22:49.117
It's normal.

22:50.286 --> 22:54.831
Oh, I know. I've just
never been a very good flier.

22:54.915 --> 22:59.377
My husband keeps reminding me
that planes want to be in the air.

22:59.462 --> 23:01.796
Well, he sounds like a very smart man.

23:01.881 --> 23:05.550
Be sure and tell him that
when he gets back from the bathroom.

23:10.639 --> 23:13.641
Well, I'll keep you company
until he does.

23:14.643 --> 23:18.188
Don't worry, it's gonna be over...

23:56.310 --> 23:59.020
It didn't sound like an animal,
not exactly.

23:59.105 --> 24:03.108
That sound it made, I keep thinking
there was something familiar about it.

24:03.192 --> 24:04.943
- Where are you from?
- The Bronx.

24:05.027 --> 24:07.987
- It might be monkeys.
- It's monkeys. Monkey Island.

24:08.072 --> 24:11.407
- We don't know if we're on an island...
- You ready?

24:16.872 --> 24:19.833
You showed me where the smoke was.
I can get there myself.

24:19.917 --> 24:21.126
I'm coming.

24:24.421 --> 24:27.340
Well, you're gonna need better shoes.

25:27.902 --> 25:32.030
Whatever it was, it wasn't natural.

25:32.114 --> 25:36.242
- Does anyone have any sunblock?
- Yeah, I do.

25:36.785 --> 25:40.705
So I was just looking
inside the fuselage.

25:40.789 --> 25:43.041
It's pretty grim in there.

25:43.125 --> 25:46.669
You think we should
do something about the...

25:48.172 --> 25:50.215
...B-O-D-Y-S?

25:52.218 --> 25:55.386
- What are you spelling, man, "bodies"?
- B-O-D-I-E-S.

25:55.471 --> 25:57.388
That sounds like a good idea.

25:57.473 --> 26:00.225
No, they'll deal with it
when they get here.

26:00.309 --> 26:02.518
I'm gonna go out
and look for the cockpit.

26:03.187 --> 26:07.482
See if we can find a transceiver to send
a distress signal. Help the rescue team.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.609
You need to keep an eye
on the wounded.

26:09.693 --> 26:12.278
If the guy in the suit wakes up,
keep him calm,

26:12.363 --> 26:15.073
but don't let him remove
that shrapnel. Understand?

26:15.157 --> 26:18.201
Got it. What about the guy
with the leg? The tourniquet...?

26:18.285 --> 26:20.745
I stopped the bleeding.
I took it off last night.

26:20.829 --> 26:25.208
- He should be all right.
- Yeah, cool. Good job.

26:25.292 --> 26:28.461
- I'll come with. I wanna help.
- I don't need any more help.

26:28.545 --> 26:31.881
No, it's cool. I don't really feel
like standing still, so...

26:35.010 --> 26:36.302
Excellent.

26:42.601 --> 26:43.935
Can I ask you something?

26:44.019 --> 26:48.940
Me? I'd be thrilled. I've been waiting.

26:49.024 --> 26:51.693
Have we ever met anywhere?

26:52.194 --> 26:55.113
No. That would be unlikely.

26:56.198 --> 26:58.866
- I look familiar though, right?
- Yeah.

26:59.994 --> 27:02.537
- You can't quite place it?
- No, I can't.

27:02.621 --> 27:06.833
- Yeah, I think I know.
- You do?

27:06.917 --> 27:11.921
You all, everybody
You all, everybody

27:12.381 --> 27:14.465
- Never heard that song?
- I've heard it.

27:14.550 --> 27:17.302
- I don't know what that...
- That's us! Drive Shaft!

27:17.386 --> 27:20.596
The ring. Second tour of Finland.
Never heard of Drive Shaft?

27:20.681 --> 27:22.265
- The band?
- Yeah, the band.

27:22.349 --> 27:25.601
- You were in Drive Shaft?
- I am in Drive Shaft. I play bass.

27:25.686 --> 27:27.145
- Serious?
- Yeah. Charlie.

27:27.229 --> 27:29.230
Track three. I do backing vocals.

27:29.315 --> 27:32.567
- My friend Beth would freak.
- Give me Beth's number, I'll call.

27:32.651 --> 27:35.445
- She live nearby?
- You ever heard of Drive Shaft?

27:35.529 --> 27:37.196
You all, everybody

27:38.198 --> 27:40.158
You all, every... body

27:41.035 --> 27:43.077
We gotta keep moving.

27:44.580 --> 27:49.083
- They were good.
- They are good. We're still together.

27:50.085 --> 27:52.754
We're in the middle of a comeback.

28:19.740 --> 28:22.408
You guys, is this normal?

28:23.118 --> 28:26.204
This kind of day turning into night.

28:26.288 --> 28:29.123
The-end-of-the-world type weather.
Guys?

28:42.137 --> 28:46.057
I'm telling you, you don't wanna go
in there! There's too many bodies!

29:05.452 --> 29:07.495
There it is again.

29:08.330 --> 29:09.956
Oh, my God.

29:55.502 --> 29:58.629
Well, let's do this.

30:37.211 --> 30:40.213
- Let's get this trans...
- Transceiver.

30:40.297 --> 30:42.924
Transceiver thing and get out of here.

31:44.987 --> 31:46.821
Come on!

31:52.953 --> 31:56.747
- You OK?
- Yeah, you?

31:56.832 --> 31:58.708
Yeah.

32:00.002 --> 32:04.422
I'm fine. Charlie's fine,
by the way. I'm OK.

32:06.925 --> 32:10.803
- Hey, you don't have to come up here.
- No, I'm good.

32:32.409 --> 32:36.746
- So, what does a transceiver look like?
- Like a complicated walkie-talkie.

33:11.907 --> 33:14.659
Hey, can you hear me?

33:17.120 --> 33:18.245
I need that water.

33:24.753 --> 33:27.463
Here. Here you go.

33:32.010 --> 33:35.471
- How many survived?
- At least 48.

33:36.223 --> 33:38.182
- Does anything feel broken?
- No, no.

33:38.266 --> 33:42.603
Just my head's a little dizzy,
that's all.

33:42.688 --> 33:45.272
It's probably a concussion.

33:46.024 --> 33:48.984
- How long has it been?
- Sixteen hours.

33:49.069 --> 33:51.112
Sixteen?

33:53.615 --> 33:56.450
- Has anybody come?
- Not yet.

34:00.247 --> 34:02.790
Six hours in...

34:05.001 --> 34:06.961
...our radio went out.

34:08.170 --> 34:09.797
No one could see us.

34:10.674 --> 34:13.676
We turned back to land in Fiji.

34:13.760 --> 34:17.138
By the time we hit turbulence...

34:18.473 --> 34:20.641
...we were a thousand miles off course.

34:23.478 --> 34:26.981
They're looking for us
in the wrong place.

34:32.779 --> 34:35.364
- We have a transceiver.
- Good, good.

34:35.449 --> 34:37.574
We were hoping.
You shouldn't move.

34:37.659 --> 34:41.579
No, no. I'm OK.
Transceiver's in there.

34:41.663 --> 34:43.289
It's right there.

34:49.838 --> 34:52.255
Where's Charlie?

35:00.599 --> 35:02.016
It's not working.

35:08.648 --> 35:10.566
Charlie?

35:14.738 --> 35:18.157
- What were you doing in the bathroom?
- What?

35:24.206 --> 35:26.248
What the hell was that?

35:26.833 --> 35:28.709
Kate.

35:34.883 --> 35:38.135
- It's right outside.
- What? What's right out...?

36:37.320 --> 36:38.904
What the hell just happened?

36:58.800 --> 37:01.010
Jack, come on!

37:01.094 --> 37:02.553
Just leave it!

37:46.556 --> 37:48.098
Hey!

37:59.569 --> 38:01.278
OK, run!

38:13.541 --> 38:15.668
Jack!

38:44.322 --> 38:46.323
One.

38:47.993 --> 38:50.244
Two.

38:50.328 --> 38:52.788
Three.

38:52.872 --> 38:54.748
Four.

38:56.793 --> 38:59.253
Five.

39:17.939 --> 39:21.108
- Where's Jack? Did you see him?
- I don't know. He pulled me up.

39:21.192 --> 39:23.318
- Where is he? How can you?
- I don't know!

39:23.403 --> 39:26.780
We got separated. I fell down.
He came back. That thing was...

39:26.865 --> 39:29.491
- Did you see it?
- No. No.

39:29.576 --> 39:32.327
But it was right there.
We were dead... I was.

39:32.412 --> 39:36.457
And then Jack came back and he
pulled me up. I don't know where he is.

39:45.050 --> 39:48.927
- We have to go back for him.
- Go back? There?

39:49.012 --> 39:52.181
There's a certain
gargantuan quality about this thing.

39:52.599 --> 39:54.266
Then don't come.

39:58.730 --> 40:00.314
Kate.

40:27.592 --> 40:29.968
I heard you shout.

40:30.678 --> 40:33.263
I heard you shout "Jack."

40:33.348 --> 40:35.265
I'm Charlie, by the way.

40:39.187 --> 40:41.188
What is that?

41:06.131 --> 41:08.173
- What is...?
- It's the pilot.

41:16.766 --> 41:18.809
Did you see it?

41:18.893 --> 41:23.147
No. It was right behind me,
but I dove into the bushes.

41:23.898 --> 41:25.274
Guys...

41:25.358 --> 41:28.485
...how does something like that happen?
