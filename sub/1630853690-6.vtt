WEBVTT

00:02.210 --> 00:05.296
-Go, go, go.
-<i>Take that, goddammit!</i>

00:05.380 --> 00:07.674
-<i>No! No!</i>
-Come on!

00:07.757 --> 00:09.592
Attack me, you little bitch.

00:09.676 --> 00:11.386
-Motherfucker.
-<i>Take that!</i>

00:14.389 --> 00:16.975
Ah, motherfucker...
Come on, hit him.

00:17.058 --> 00:18.935
-<i>Take that, bastard!</i>
-Huh?

00:19.018 --> 00:20.603
-What did you say?
-<i>Take that, bastard!</i>

00:20.687 --> 00:24.399
<i>No! No!</i>

00:24.482 --> 00:26.443
Motherfucking son of a bitch,
I got you.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.420
You have a good hand.

00:45.503 --> 00:47.213
-Huh?
-I said you have a good hand.

01:06.649 --> 01:08.735
Are you having dinner, sweetie?

01:09.778 --> 01:10.987
I need to study.

01:12.071 --> 01:13.406
I'm taking this.

01:49.442 --> 01:50.568
Eat.

03:18.239 --> 03:20.700
THE PACK

03:31.920 --> 03:34.756
We have to go back.
They were with Blanca!

03:34.839 --> 03:38.593
I'm not going to put your life
in danger, Celeste.

03:38.676 --> 03:41.137
I beg you, Elisa.

03:41.220 --> 03:43.640
Please, let me find Blanca.

03:47.352 --> 03:48.937
OK.

03:54.108 --> 03:55.985
I can't... I can't.

03:57.195 --> 03:58.488
Get up, bastard.

03:59.572 --> 04:02.742
Come on, get in the car.

04:04.243 --> 04:05.745
Good job.

04:14.796 --> 04:17.757
Celeste, get me alcohol and
gauze
from the glove compartment.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.977
I guess you know who will be
the bad one tonight.

04:32.772 --> 04:35.525
You have to let me go,
this is kidnapping.

04:37.986 --> 04:40.113
Now we're speaking
the same language.

04:43.825 --> 04:44.909
Let's see.

04:50.415 --> 04:52.125
Where's Blanca?

04:53.543 --> 04:55.586
-We went to a park.
-Which park?

04:55.670 --> 04:56.921
Downtown.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.965
Cox St. at Santa Isabel,
that's where he was.

04:59.048 --> 05:01.968
-Who is he? What's his name?
-I don't know.

05:02.051 --> 05:03.553
All I know is he got in the car.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.722
I got out, and our part was
done.

05:05.805 --> 05:08.224
Did he dress like a dumbass,
like you?

05:08.307 --> 05:10.768
No, he wore a...

05:10.852 --> 05:12.770
A white smock with a...

05:12.854 --> 05:15.857
With an embroidered green cross
on the smock, I don't know.

05:15.940 --> 05:18.026
It was early, at dawn.

05:19.110 --> 05:21.696
He was a pharmacist.

05:21.779 --> 05:23.865
Was there a name on the smock?

05:23.948 --> 05:26.200
I can't remember.

05:53.144 --> 05:54.604
Mom?

05:56.939 --> 05:59.150
-What happened to you?
-It doesn't matter.

05:59.233 --> 06:01.652
-But who did that to you?
-Whatever, it's not important.

06:01.736 --> 06:03.654
-What's that, Mom!
-Know what, Gonzalo?

06:03.738 --> 06:05.782
I need you to listen.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.120
I want you to know that...

06:13.831 --> 06:15.750
despite what you did to Dani,

06:15.833 --> 06:17.627
we're in this together.

06:18.586 --> 06:19.587
OK?

06:22.090 --> 06:23.674
For that to happen,

06:25.218 --> 06:27.178
it's very important to me...

06:29.514 --> 06:32.433
that you tell me the truth,
however tough it may be.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.657
I'm a piece of shit.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.829
No, you're not a piece of shit.

06:54.497 --> 06:56.207
You're a precious little brat.

06:57.542 --> 07:00.378
That's why I want to know
what happened to you.

07:02.797 --> 07:04.215
I...

07:04.298 --> 07:08.094
I feel so alone, Mom.

07:33.619 --> 07:35.204
Give me your hand.

07:40.168 --> 07:41.919
You're not alone.

07:45.631 --> 07:47.049
You have me.

07:48.551 --> 07:50.136
Even if that's not a lot.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.390
And I have you.

07:57.476 --> 07:59.979
And if later on,
we have to move away,

08:00.062 --> 08:02.732
and start over somewhere else,
we will.

08:04.275 --> 08:05.860
But meanwhile...

08:07.111 --> 08:09.113
the first thing
we're going to do...

08:11.741 --> 08:13.367
...together, is...

08:14.619 --> 08:16.829
we're going to go
to Carla's place,

08:16.913 --> 08:18.831
and say we're sorry.

08:18.915 --> 08:20.791
-Yes.
-No, no, no.

08:22.210 --> 08:23.878
Yes, because we're brave.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.215
And when we make mistakes,

08:29.342 --> 08:30.968
we say we're sorry.

08:33.596 --> 08:35.097
And we try to move on.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.660
We need three.

08:55.743 --> 08:58.079
-Three, OK.
-We're up front.

08:58.162 --> 09:00.039
-We need one more.
-OK, Natalia.

09:00.122 --> 09:03.084
OK, it's important for everyone
to be here really early.

09:03.167 --> 09:05.962
-At five a.m. Set an alarm.
-OK, we will.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.800
Adolf! How many are coming
from your class?

09:10.883 --> 09:12.385
Twenty, at 7:30.

09:12.468 --> 09:14.720
Ask them to come earlier, at
five.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.389
-Jose.
-What's this?

09:17.723 --> 09:20.935
We're going to camp here
so they see us and get upset.

09:21.018 --> 09:23.854
We're not moving
until Blanca turns up.

09:23.938 --> 09:26.107
What we should have done
a while ago.

09:30.278 --> 09:32.196
OK, so we're missing
two more for--

09:32.280 --> 09:33.656
No, we need more
at the side doors.

09:33.739 --> 09:35.283
-Right.
-And in the back.

09:35.366 --> 09:36.492
OK...

09:51.424 --> 09:52.508
Hello, Javi.

09:52.591 --> 09:54.135
-<i>Hi, Elisa.</i>
-Hi.

09:54.218 --> 09:56.178
I need information
on all pharmacy owners

09:56.262 --> 09:58.389
and employees near Almagro Park.

10:01.058 --> 10:03.436
-Elisa, I'm at home.
-<i>I know, Javi.</i>

10:03.519 --> 10:05.479
But I need you to go
to the station,

10:05.563 --> 10:07.440
and get me that information.

10:07.523 --> 10:09.900
-Now?
-Yes, now.

10:09.984 --> 10:11.610
I'm very close to finding Blanca

10:11.694 --> 10:13.738
<i>but I can't explain</i>
<i>over the phone.</i>

10:13.821 --> 10:17.366
OK, I'll call you as soon
as I know anything.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.951
OK, thanks.

10:20.119 --> 10:22.455
Elisa, there are at least
12 drugstores.

10:22.538 --> 10:24.248
-Name one.
-Which?

10:24.332 --> 10:26.083
The first one.

10:34.675 --> 10:36.135
Hi.

10:43.976 --> 10:45.186
Carla...

10:47.146 --> 10:50.524
Gonzalo regrets what he did,
he regrets it very much.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.819
I know you don't like
hearing this, but...

10:54.779 --> 10:56.280
he's 15.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.408
He's also a victim.

11:04.872 --> 11:06.707
I'm very regretful, Carla.

11:06.791 --> 11:08.084
Really.

11:09.001 --> 11:10.920
And I would never hurt Dani,
seriously.

11:11.003 --> 11:12.671
I'd rather...kill myself
instead.

11:12.755 --> 11:13.839
No, hey.

11:16.675 --> 11:18.177
Wait in the car.

11:19.845 --> 11:21.222
Gonzalo.

11:27.978 --> 11:29.397
Can we talk?

11:36.487 --> 11:39.323
I understand what you're going
through is very tough, Carla.

11:40.908 --> 11:42.535
Being far from your daughters,

11:42.618 --> 11:44.703
fearing something
will happen to them...

11:44.787 --> 11:46.330
That's the worst nightmare.

11:50.376 --> 11:52.420
For one of your children
to be in pain

11:52.503 --> 11:54.505
or cause pain to others, and--

11:54.588 --> 11:56.966
I know this is hard for you,
too.

12:00.469 --> 12:01.971
Did you talk to Marcos?

12:04.390 --> 12:05.474
No.

12:07.268 --> 12:08.644
I can't.

12:10.312 --> 12:12.857
I'm ashamed.
I don't know what I would say.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.153
I exposed my children to that.

12:17.236 --> 12:18.612
-It's not your fault.
-Yes.

12:18.696 --> 12:19.989
-No, no.
-Yes, yes.

12:20.072 --> 12:21.407
It's my fault.

12:22.491 --> 12:23.868
Just like Gonzalo is yours.

12:25.995 --> 12:28.497
That's exactly why we have
to stick together in this.

12:30.541 --> 12:33.210
Whoever's behind
this fucking game,

12:33.294 --> 12:35.087
this is exactly what they want.

12:36.505 --> 12:39.550
To divide us, and to eat us up
one by one.

12:40.676 --> 12:42.052
And we can't allow that.

12:43.637 --> 12:45.264
We can't quit this case now.

12:45.347 --> 12:46.932
We can't, no.

12:47.016 --> 12:49.477
The thought of him returning...

12:49.560 --> 12:51.437
-Messing with my daughters...
-He's already in.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.109
He's inside our homes.

12:58.819 --> 13:00.362
Inside our lives.

13:02.781 --> 13:04.658
And if we know one thing
about The Wolf,

13:04.742 --> 13:06.660
it's that he's merciless.

13:06.744 --> 13:09.622
I'm out of the game.

13:12.958 --> 13:15.294
So there are only
two roads here, Carla.

13:16.795 --> 13:18.255
Either we go after him

13:18.339 --> 13:20.966
or that fucker will keep coming
after us,

13:21.050 --> 13:23.511
and won't stop until
he's through with us.

13:26.597 --> 13:28.182
After what happened with
Gonzalo,

13:28.265 --> 13:30.935
I wouldn't dare to ask you
to trust me.

13:31.018 --> 13:33.854
I can barely look at you
in the eye.

13:37.441 --> 13:39.568
But I trust only you, Carla.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.614
And I need you in my team.

13:46.367 --> 13:47.910
You don't have to answer
right away,

13:47.993 --> 13:50.454
but I ask you to please,
think it over.

13:53.415 --> 13:54.750
I'm going to go see my son.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.628
-I'll go with you.
-No.

14:09.139 --> 14:11.100
-How did it go?
-Fine.

14:15.187 --> 14:16.981
Gonzalo, I'm taking
the day off tomorrow

14:17.064 --> 14:19.066
and bringing you to Grandma's
on the coast.

14:19.149 --> 14:21.902
No, no. No, please, no.

14:21.986 --> 14:23.988
I'm leaving the game. Trust me.

14:24.071 --> 14:25.322
I trust you.

14:26.574 --> 14:27.825
But I'm your mother,

14:28.867 --> 14:31.120
I know you need to be far away.

14:33.205 --> 14:36.917
Without your routine,
without people...

14:37.001 --> 14:39.128
and above all,
without your cell phone.

14:39.211 --> 14:42.965
No, no, no. I need it, Mom, no.

14:46.010 --> 14:47.803
I'm going to help you, I
promise.

14:47.886 --> 14:51.056
But we'll do it my way, OK?

14:51.140 --> 14:53.017
You have to trust me, too.

14:54.518 --> 14:55.936
Give me the phone.

15:09.116 --> 15:10.784
Put your seat belt on.

15:29.261 --> 15:31.096
Thanks, good night.

15:33.807 --> 15:35.059
Goodbye.

16:02.211 --> 16:04.338
ON GUARD

16:05.798 --> 16:07.508
ON GUARD

16:35.577 --> 16:36.787
I got this.
Can't stall it too long.

16:36.870 --> 16:38.122
Look and inform Fernández now.

16:53.387 --> 16:55.514
Olivia, I need you to come
to the station now.

16:55.597 --> 16:56.640
Something happened.

16:58.892 --> 17:00.227
Gonzalo.

17:01.812 --> 17:03.063
Gonzalo.

17:05.649 --> 17:07.901
I have to go to the station.
It's urgent.

17:08.736 --> 17:10.154
-OK?
-OK.

17:10.237 --> 17:13.198
-Promise you'll...
-No, stop.

17:13.282 --> 17:15.159
Let's stop talking
about that, please.

17:15.242 --> 17:16.452
Alright.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.205
OK, bye.

17:36.096 --> 17:38.057
Hello?

17:38.140 --> 17:39.475
Anyone?

17:48.942 --> 17:51.111
-It's closed.
-It says it opens in 20 minutes.

17:51.195 --> 17:52.404
Let's go.

18:12.382 --> 18:13.592
How does it feel?

18:13.675 --> 18:14.802
What?

18:16.095 --> 18:17.096
To kill.

18:22.684 --> 18:25.395
When I was your age,
I was a lot like you.

18:27.898 --> 18:29.316
I saw how messed up the world
was

18:29.399 --> 18:31.860
and that society did nothing
to change it.

18:33.904 --> 18:35.114
What happened to you?

18:35.197 --> 18:37.032
I had to deal with consequences.

18:38.575 --> 18:40.494
There are always consequences.

18:42.329 --> 18:44.748
One day I met an older man,

18:44.832 --> 18:46.083
a teacher.

18:47.835 --> 18:50.170
We saw the world...
quite similarly.

18:52.005 --> 18:54.007
It was just a matter
of looking at my file.

18:57.135 --> 18:58.595
Look, Celeste.

19:00.514 --> 19:04.101
When I was about 14
or 15 years old,

19:06.019 --> 19:07.855
my parents kicked me out

19:09.064 --> 19:10.482
and I lived on the street.

19:11.692 --> 19:13.861
I know the streets very well.

19:13.944 --> 19:15.779
Death was my friend.

19:17.030 --> 19:19.825
But he insisted there was
something else to the story.

19:19.908 --> 19:21.326
And?

19:22.619 --> 19:24.997
One day, I told him
what he wanted to hear.

19:26.415 --> 19:27.833
I gave him a name.

19:30.210 --> 19:31.587
Ferrer.

19:51.481 --> 19:52.733
<i>Petersen went out</i>

19:52.816 --> 19:54.526
<i>and started doing what he</i>
<i>preached</i>
<i>in his class.</i>

20:11.418 --> 20:13.378
<i>Victims started turning up</i>

20:13.462 --> 20:15.797
<i>with bullet wounds</i>
<i>in their heads...</i>

20:15.881 --> 20:18.258
<i>and their case files</i>
<i>on their chests.</i>

20:20.427 --> 20:23.972
Rapist priests, pedophiles,
corrupt politicians...

20:24.973 --> 20:26.725
and unscrupulous magnates.

20:30.604 --> 20:32.147
When Petersen killed Ferrer,

20:33.398 --> 20:36.360
I felt like all that fear
that I had inside

20:36.443 --> 20:38.862
just vanished in minutes.

20:38.946 --> 20:41.740
I went to therapy, a
psychiatrist.

20:41.823 --> 20:43.700
And what happened with Petersen?

20:43.784 --> 20:45.118
Was he arrested?

20:46.745 --> 20:49.581
We find the defendant guilty,
sentenced to...

20:49.665 --> 20:51.792
<i>I don't know if I was right</i>
<i>to press charges,</i>

20:51.875 --> 20:54.878
<i>nor do I know if he was right</i>
<i>to kill Ferrer and the others.</i>

20:54.962 --> 20:59.091
...of reiterated crimes,
will go into effect
immediately...

20:59.174 --> 21:01.969
<i>I know you want to kill those</i>
<i>who did this to your sister.</i>

21:02.052 --> 21:03.720
<i>I'm not judging you.</i>

21:03.804 --> 21:06.515
When you fulfill that fantasy...

21:07.557 --> 21:08.934
you pay the price.

21:20.278 --> 21:21.363
Elisa.

21:31.331 --> 21:32.708
The pharmacist on duty.

21:34.668 --> 21:37.129
The second one we visited
should have been open.

21:37.212 --> 21:38.797
The one called, "Diez de Julio."

21:38.880 --> 21:41.383
-OK, let's go.
-That's the one, Elisa.

22:00.861 --> 22:02.029
Do you know anything else?

22:05.032 --> 22:07.034
Yes.

22:07.117 --> 22:08.618
She just called me.

22:08.702 --> 22:10.996
She asked me for some
information

22:11.079 --> 22:12.998
and asked me
not to tell anyone, but...

22:13.081 --> 22:14.708
After seeing the video,

22:14.791 --> 22:16.376
-I'd rather not respond.
-Call her.

22:29.723 --> 22:31.516
Hi Javi, did you get
what I asked for?

22:31.600 --> 22:33.268
I need the information.

22:33.351 --> 22:34.853
What the hell did you do, Elisa?

22:34.936 --> 22:36.730
<i>Olivia, I was calling you</i>
<i>all night.</i>

22:36.813 --> 22:39.483
<i>Why? For permission to shoot</i>
<i>three civilians in the back?</i>

22:39.566 --> 22:42.402
<i>Everyone's waiting for us</i>
<i>to fuck up and you go and do it.</i>

22:42.486 --> 22:44.863
Forgive me for not covering
for your little adventure.

22:44.946 --> 22:47.407
<i>I don't need you to cover me,</i>
<i>I need your help.</i>

22:47.491 --> 22:49.034
We're about to find Blanca.

22:49.117 --> 22:50.911
<i>We? Who? Who are you with?</i>

22:50.994 --> 22:53.038
-Celeste.
-<i>Are you shitting me?</i>

22:53.121 --> 22:54.998
She got intel on the kidnapper.

22:55.082 --> 22:57.501
Bring that minor
to the station, now!

22:57.584 --> 23:00.462
No, I can't bring her.
Are you going to help me or not?

23:00.545 --> 23:02.964
You've gone crazy, Elisa.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

23:03.048 --> 23:04.132
Bring the girl back.

23:04.216 --> 23:05.467
Her whole family's
looking for her.

23:05.550 --> 23:07.969
Olivia, please,
we're so close to finding her.

23:08.053 --> 23:10.597
I need you to give me an
address.

23:10.680 --> 23:12.307
You realize that
if I cover for you here,

23:12.390 --> 23:13.725
I'm an accomplice
to what you've done

23:13.809 --> 23:16.103
and whatever insanity is next?

23:16.186 --> 23:18.313
-<i>Help me out, Olivia.</i>
-What if you're wrong?

23:18.396 --> 23:22.109
I'm not wrong, trust me.
Please, time is running out.

23:28.615 --> 23:31.409
Javi will give you
that information.

23:31.493 --> 23:33.453
And I'll be responsible
for anything you do,

23:33.537 --> 23:34.996
so please be careful.

23:37.791 --> 23:39.000
Perfect, thanks.

23:40.627 --> 23:43.213
Elisa, I have information
on almost all the owners.

23:43.296 --> 23:46.675
-Which pharmacy do you need?
-<i>"Diez de Julio" Pharmacy.</i>

23:48.969 --> 23:50.220
Yes, I have it.

23:50.303 --> 23:52.639
The owner's name is Oscar Ruiz.

23:52.722 --> 23:54.057
Oscar Ruiz.

23:54.141 --> 23:57.185
-<i>Address: 4366 Santa Isabel.</i>
-4366 Santa Isabel.

23:57.269 --> 23:59.396
Thanks, Javi. I'll call you.
Bye.

24:16.329 --> 24:17.998
Hi.

24:18.081 --> 24:19.833
Hi.

24:19.916 --> 24:22.294
Did you already turn in
your resignation?

24:26.173 --> 24:28.341
Manuel's talking to Benjamín
in 30 minutes.

24:28.425 --> 24:29.926
He asked me to join him.

24:31.386 --> 24:32.637
Do you want to?

24:35.307 --> 24:37.184
I want to find
whoever did this to my Dani.

24:38.518 --> 24:39.811
And to your Gonzalo.

25:02.209 --> 25:03.251
Take the phone.

25:04.544 --> 25:06.963
-No, I'm not going back.
-I'm just following an order.

25:07.047 --> 25:09.633
If you have questions,
you should talk to your
superior.

25:09.716 --> 25:12.802
-I don't have any superior.
-Gonzalo, take the phone

25:12.886 --> 25:15.805
before something happens
that you might regret.

25:15.889 --> 25:17.307
Take it.

25:21.686 --> 25:23.021
Very good.

25:36.910 --> 25:37.994
THE GAME ISN'T OVER.

25:38.078 --> 25:39.746
IF YOU LEAVE, YOU WILL SUFFER
CONSEQUENCES.

25:42.499 --> 25:45.085
NEXT TIME, MY TROPHY WILL BE
MORE THAN A LOCK OF HAIR.

25:46.920 --> 25:49.172
What do I have to do?

25:52.300 --> 25:54.135
YOU'LL FIND ANSWERS HERE...

25:56.054 --> 25:58.390
WOMEN HAVE LIED TO YOU
ALL YOUR LIFE.

26:36.428 --> 26:37.721
Hi.

26:38.722 --> 26:39.889
Hi.

26:41.599 --> 26:43.935
-How are you?
-Good.

26:44.019 --> 26:45.770
-Shall we?
-Let's.

26:45.854 --> 26:47.439
Manuel, um...

26:48.398 --> 26:50.150
I'm sorry, I didn't...

26:52.027 --> 26:56.781
I mean, I'll take responsibility
for what happened between us...

26:56.865 --> 26:58.992
-I want to tell you, I don't--
-Carla.

27:00.660 --> 27:03.121
I understand
you're a married woman,

27:03.204 --> 27:04.789
and that won't change.

27:07.042 --> 27:09.252
Really, you don't need
to explain anything.

27:09.336 --> 27:10.754
We're adults.

27:12.130 --> 27:13.673
-Shall we?
-Yeah.

27:36.363 --> 27:38.406
-This way, please.
-Thank you.

27:39.449 --> 27:41.159
-How are you?
-Hello.

27:42.369 --> 27:43.620
Hello.

27:43.703 --> 27:44.829
-Thank you.
-Come in.

27:44.913 --> 27:46.414
Benjamín, how are you?

27:46.498 --> 27:49.000
Hey, Dad, I only asked
to speak with Manuel.

27:50.085 --> 27:53.713
Benjamín, they're here
to help you, OK?

27:56.007 --> 27:57.258
Is that alright?

27:58.385 --> 28:00.804
-Yes.
-Are you starting?

28:02.013 --> 28:04.140
We need to record you, Benjamín.

28:04.224 --> 28:06.559
Yes, it's protocol,
no need to be afraid.

28:07.560 --> 28:09.396
I'll explain, OK?

28:09.479 --> 28:11.856
-Be kind.
-Yes, rest easy.

28:11.940 --> 28:13.942
-It'll be at his pace.
-Thank you.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.904
-Just a second, OK?
-Benjamín...

28:19.364 --> 28:20.907
Tell us what happened.

28:22.826 --> 28:24.285
I just don't know.

28:27.205 --> 28:29.249
What happened just doesn't
make any sense.

28:29.332 --> 28:30.667
It makes no sense.

28:31.584 --> 28:32.836
I know.

28:34.087 --> 28:37.215
But a requirement to get you
out of here is for you to talk.

28:39.300 --> 28:41.761
Good people need to get things
off their chests.

28:43.888 --> 28:45.765
That's the thing,
I'm not a good person.

28:45.849 --> 28:48.685
Benjamín, everything you say
will be taken as a confession.

28:48.768 --> 28:50.103
Do you understand that?

28:50.186 --> 28:52.981
I need to hear you
say you understand.

28:53.064 --> 28:54.774
Yes, I understand.

28:57.485 --> 29:00.905
It all began when my group
of friends and I

29:00.989 --> 29:03.450
started to bother women at
school,
calling them "feminazis."

29:03.533 --> 29:04.742
-With whom?
-With...

29:04.826 --> 29:07.328
Augusto, Eduardo,
Victor and myself.

29:07.412 --> 29:08.997
We're very close.

29:09.080 --> 29:11.499
Or we used to be very close,
not anymore.

29:14.544 --> 29:16.880
Then, the only thing
people talked about at school

29:16.963 --> 29:19.048
was the girls' strike.

29:21.468 --> 29:23.970
And later Victor came
to school with a game.

29:25.013 --> 29:27.974
A game that some friends of his,
from a different school,

29:28.057 --> 29:30.477
-were playing, too.
-What game?

29:30.560 --> 29:32.145
The Wolf's Game.

29:33.396 --> 29:35.064
We weren't allowed to sleep,

29:35.148 --> 29:37.734
we had to stay up
watching porn all night.

29:39.444 --> 29:41.196
And then we were supposed to...

29:42.655 --> 29:45.074
We had to mark our prey.

29:45.158 --> 29:47.452
What do you mean? Your prey?

29:47.535 --> 29:49.037
Continue.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.788
Blanca.

29:52.123 --> 29:53.917
We had to hand Blanca over.

29:58.087 --> 30:00.131
Augusto was the one
who picked her,

30:00.215 --> 30:02.133
because she had
the whole school radicalized

30:02.217 --> 30:05.720
with the accusations
against Ossandón.

30:07.347 --> 30:09.807
Add that to the fact that Blanca
wasn't attracted to him.

30:09.891 --> 30:12.810
Later, they had to pick someone
to win her over.

30:13.978 --> 30:15.772
So the group picked me.

30:15.855 --> 30:16.981
Come on, faggot!

30:18.566 --> 30:20.026
I'm sorry!

30:21.819 --> 30:23.238
Come on, fucker!

30:33.081 --> 30:34.749
What happened next?

30:34.832 --> 30:38.211
Then, after that, we were told
explicitly to leave her there,

30:38.294 --> 30:39.879
on her own, but...

30:41.214 --> 30:42.966
But I couldn't
just leave her alone.

31:00.441 --> 31:02.402
If I were to ask you to describe
those two people,

31:02.485 --> 31:03.987
-could you?
-No.

31:04.070 --> 31:06.155
Their heights, a particularity,
anything.

31:06.239 --> 31:07.699
I don't remember,
because I didn't see them.

31:07.782 --> 31:09.450
Because I hid like a coward.

31:09.534 --> 31:11.578
A coward, OK?

31:11.661 --> 31:13.246
-That's why I hid.
-That's enough.

31:13.329 --> 31:15.957
-I'm a coward!
-That's enough! Thanks a lot.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.417
-I don't remember at all.
-OK.

31:17.500 --> 31:19.669
OK, love. You're very brave.

31:23.047 --> 31:24.340
What'll happen now?

31:26.884 --> 31:28.720
What'll happen is
we'll talk to a judge

31:28.803 --> 31:31.180
to take Benjamín's statement
as soon as possible.

31:31.264 --> 31:32.599
That's what's going to happen.

31:37.562 --> 31:39.689
<i>Hello? I'm listening.</i>

31:39.772 --> 31:42.734
Elisa Murillo, Investigator.
I need to talk to you, please.

31:43.526 --> 31:45.653
-<i>I'll be right out.</i>
-Thanks.

31:50.908 --> 31:53.161
Good day. I need to know
the whereabouts

31:53.244 --> 31:55.288
of your pharmacy employee.

31:55.371 --> 31:57.248
-Emiliano Gonzalez?
-That's correct.

31:57.332 --> 31:59.375
-He's at the pharmacy.
-No, it's closed.

31:59.459 --> 32:01.252
That's why I'm here.

32:01.336 --> 32:03.588
Look, I can't give you
any information

32:03.671 --> 32:05.882
until I know exactly
what is going on.

32:05.965 --> 32:09.260
My sister was kidnapped
and he knows where she is.

32:09.344 --> 32:11.095
If you don't tell me
where your colleague is,

32:11.179 --> 32:12.722
it's your problem, not mine.

32:14.599 --> 32:15.850
I don't have the address,

32:15.933 --> 32:17.810
but I can give you
his home number.

32:17.894 --> 32:19.646
That'll be more than enough.

33:04.941 --> 33:08.152
We're closed.
We're about to open, anyway.

33:08.236 --> 33:10.279
-OK.
-My dad is cleaning.

33:15.493 --> 33:18.913
Sweetie, why don't you bring me
a rag from the back, please?

33:18.996 --> 33:20.081
OK, Dad.

33:26.921 --> 33:27.964
What's your name?

33:28.047 --> 33:29.757
Gonzalo Fernández.

33:42.895 --> 33:44.313
How did you find me?

33:46.357 --> 33:47.483
Do you know me?

33:52.196 --> 33:53.531
I'm your father.

33:58.661 --> 34:00.329
OK.

34:00.413 --> 34:02.498
OK, on my way.

34:02.582 --> 34:04.333
Bye.

34:04.417 --> 34:06.043
Everything OK?

34:06.127 --> 34:07.545
No.

34:09.422 --> 34:13.176
I'm sorry about my attitude
in there, I...

34:14.844 --> 34:18.306
-It wasn't very professional.
-No, relax.

34:18.389 --> 34:20.600
Things like that happen,
it's fine.

34:26.939 --> 34:29.984
I've only lost my cool once
in this job, you know?

34:31.986 --> 34:34.572
In Oaxaca, a place in Mexico.

34:35.615 --> 34:36.949
A rural school.

34:38.993 --> 34:41.037
I was talking to the father
of a six-year-old girl.

34:41.954 --> 34:43.289
Six.

34:45.666 --> 34:48.085
He told me she was his daughter,

34:48.169 --> 34:50.338
and he could do with her
as he pleased.

34:54.133 --> 34:56.010
Today, in there, it was...

34:58.554 --> 35:01.307
It was almost the second time
in my life I lost it.

35:10.441 --> 35:11.609
Why did you leave?

35:11.692 --> 35:13.402
Is that what your mom told you?

35:15.488 --> 35:18.157
Shit. Of course
that's what she told you.

35:20.326 --> 35:21.911
-And that wasn't the case?
-No.

35:23.454 --> 35:25.289
I was looking for you for years.

35:26.332 --> 35:29.043
I did everything I could,
we didn't live here back then.

35:29.126 --> 35:30.169
I came from the north to live

35:30.253 --> 35:32.004
in this hellhole of a city
to find you.

35:32.839 --> 35:35.174
But your mom is a police officer
and I am not.

35:35.258 --> 35:36.676
So that was the end of the road
for me.

35:43.266 --> 35:45.309
I know there's a lot to say,
but...

35:46.644 --> 35:49.772
I don't want to talk about this
with you, talk to your mom.

35:49.856 --> 35:51.065
It's her story.

35:54.402 --> 35:55.862
You feel rage, don't you?

35:57.947 --> 36:00.324
That's good,
because it'll help you heal.

36:03.202 --> 36:06.080
Believe me,
I was enraged for years.

36:06.163 --> 36:08.082
I missed you so much.

36:11.377 --> 36:12.795
I don't believe you.

36:16.716 --> 36:19.594
Well, I won't treat you like a
kid
because you're not.

36:21.888 --> 36:23.431
I won't lie to you, either.

36:23.514 --> 36:26.684
I know it's not possible for me
to be your dad anymore.

36:29.645 --> 36:32.231
-I already lost you.
-Tell me what happened.

36:34.775 --> 36:35.985
Speak!

36:42.575 --> 36:44.410
Ask your mom who did this to me.

36:50.791 --> 36:52.793
-Is that a bullet wound?
-After this...

36:53.836 --> 36:55.796
she grabbed you and disappeared.

36:58.591 --> 37:00.092
I didn't abandon you.

37:02.219 --> 37:03.846
She took you away from me.

37:27.370 --> 37:31.457
-What the fuck are you doing?
-<i>0271 Coquimbo.</i>

37:31.540 --> 37:33.834
-0271 Coquimbo?
-That's where the kidnapper is!

37:33.918 --> 37:36.379
0271 Coquimbo, on my way.

37:36.462 --> 37:38.422
Shit! Shit!

38:05.241 --> 38:09.203
Stop, please, stop.

38:09.286 --> 38:12.999
I swear I won't tell anyone
anything, please.

38:13.082 --> 38:15.584
I promise. Can you just leave
me?

38:15.668 --> 38:18.546
I promise, please.

38:18.629 --> 38:20.756
I promise.

38:22.508 --> 38:24.343
I promise...

38:41.652 --> 38:43.029
Who's this?

38:44.447 --> 38:46.073
It's me.

38:46.157 --> 38:48.117
Gonzalo, are you OK? What is it?

38:48.200 --> 38:49.535
I can't talk right now.

38:49.618 --> 38:51.746
<i>I met a man who says he's my</i>
<i>dad.</i>

38:52.997 --> 38:54.206
<i>It is true?</i>

38:55.750 --> 38:57.835
<i>Why didn't you tell me anything?</i>

38:57.918 --> 38:59.795
-Gonzalo...
-<i>Answer me!</i>

39:01.839 --> 39:03.090
<i>Answer me, Mom.</i>

39:03.174 --> 39:06.218
You know that you're
my top priority, right, son?

39:06.302 --> 39:07.928
<i>Son?</i>

39:09.346 --> 39:11.223
-Son?
-<i>Then it is true.</i>

39:11.307 --> 39:12.683
Son!

39:12.767 --> 39:14.101
Gonzalo...

39:19.857 --> 39:21.776
Why do you hate me so much?

39:23.611 --> 39:25.071
No!

40:04.068 --> 40:05.903
Elisa Murillo, Investigator.

40:05.986 --> 40:07.238
Police.

40:07.988 --> 40:09.281
Is something the matter?

40:09.365 --> 40:11.826
-Is your son home?
-Yes.

40:11.909 --> 40:13.160
Excuse me.

40:20.126 --> 40:23.212
-Where's your son?
-Upstairs, in his room.

40:45.526 --> 40:47.611
-Yes?
-It's the police, son.

40:47.695 --> 40:49.196
They want a word with you.

40:53.784 --> 40:56.245
-How can I help you?
-I need to ask you some
questions.

40:56.328 --> 40:58.622
Questions about what?

40:59.582 --> 41:01.375
About an internet group.

41:02.710 --> 41:06.422
Which internet group?
I'm a member of several.

41:14.930 --> 41:17.808
That's the point, come out
and we can discuss it.

41:19.059 --> 41:22.146
If you tell me exactly
which group this is about, I...

41:22.229 --> 41:23.397
I might...

41:24.940 --> 41:28.485
Son! What have you done?

41:28.569 --> 41:29.945
Stop!

41:43.083 --> 41:44.668
Where's my sister?

41:50.716 --> 41:53.093
The Wolf forced me,
he threatened me!

41:53.177 --> 41:55.221
It had to be done,
it was the only way.

41:59.808 --> 42:02.061
-Are you OK?
-Yes.

42:03.520 --> 42:05.147
Let's search the house.

42:31.715 --> 42:33.634
Blanca!

42:33.717 --> 42:35.761
Blanca, Blanca!

42:35.844 --> 42:38.305
Come here, come here.
There, there.

42:38.389 --> 42:42.601
There you are, come here,
beautiful, look at me. Here!

42:42.685 --> 42:45.437
There you go, breathe, that's
it!

42:45.521 --> 42:47.481
Very good, beautiful, very good.

42:47.564 --> 42:51.277
With me, Blanca! Blanca!

42:55.948 --> 42:57.533
Up here!
