00:00.010 --> 00:02.950
Somebody's just called from
a phone box on Regent Street.

00:03.000 --> 00:04.500
They said they're going
to cut somebody's throat.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.210
He's had extensive surgery
to his upper chest,

00:08.260 --> 00:09.610
likely double mastectomy.

00:09.660 --> 00:11.210
He's transgender?

00:11.260 --> 00:13.290
We need to talk. How are we
ever going to sort this out

00:13.340 --> 00:15.930
- if we don't sit down and speak?
- I can't even look at you.

00:15.980 --> 00:18.930
- None of us could think of anyone
better than you. - And the job is...?

00:18.980 --> 00:20.690
Head of Faculty.

00:20.740 --> 00:23.170
So, the helpline is solely
for trans people, is it?

00:23.220 --> 00:25.570
People wanting to change
their gender identity,

00:25.620 --> 00:27.500
their friends and family.

00:29.420 --> 00:31.970
There's blood in my daughter's bathroom.

00:32.020 --> 00:33.490
No body? So where is she?

00:33.540 --> 00:36.250
Now, we may have another victim.

00:36.300 --> 00:38.690
Not trans this time, but she
was coming out of Transaction.

00:38.740 --> 00:40.900
So you may have a witness?

00:41.980 --> 00:44.010
Fingerprint from the Williams' window

00:44.060 --> 00:46.490
is a match with a guy called Toby Logan.

00:46.540 --> 00:47.650
Police! Stop!

00:47.700 --> 00:50.290
The print on the pendant Evie was wearing

00:50.340 --> 00:51.890
is a match with this guy, Nick Marlow.

00:51.940 --> 00:53.850
Hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa!
I've not done anything!

00:53.900 --> 00:56.490
- So, where is Evie now?
- How would I know that?

00:56.540 --> 00:58.570
- And where is she?
- I don't know.

00:58.620 --> 00:59.890
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

00:59.940 --> 01:03.650
Right, so there's nothing to hold
him on, then. Let's bail Marlow.

01:03.700 --> 01:06.530
Rico Abbey is unsteady on
his feet, plus he vomited.

01:06.580 --> 01:09.410
Maybe it wasn't just alcohol
that caused Rico problems.

01:09.460 --> 01:11.890
Rico Abbey had a significant quantity

01:11.940 --> 01:13.090
- of GHB in his system.
- OK.

01:13.140 --> 01:15.250
We've also found it on an
item of clothing that Marlow

01:15.300 --> 01:16.890
was wearing when he was arrested.

01:16.940 --> 01:18.970
Where's Marlow? Has he been released yet?

01:19.020 --> 01:20.850
Yeah, like you said, a
couple of hours ago.

01:20.900 --> 01:22.610
Shit. Shit! Shit!

01:22.660 --> 01:24.210
I know what it's like to be you.

01:24.260 --> 01:26.860
I really hurt someone that
I loved. You know that.

OK. What have we got?

02:50.740 --> 02:52.610
Well, some obvious similarities.

02:52.660 --> 02:55.530
Like Rico, I think the whole thing
took place inside a cubicle.

02:55.580 --> 02:58.050
He's got blunt-force
trauma to his forehead

02:58.100 --> 02:59.730
and to the back of his head,

02:59.780 --> 03:01.730
probably from where the
cubicle door was smashed in.

03:01.780 --> 03:03.970
And a single stab wound
to his carotid artery.

03:04.020 --> 03:05.490
He'd have bled out in minutes.

03:05.540 --> 03:07.290
You got anything?

03:07.340 --> 03:10.250
It's a bar toilet, so there's
multiple prints all over the place.

03:10.300 --> 03:12.250
I'll run them through
the database for you.

03:12.300 --> 03:15.410
There's mud on the floor. Possibly
the same boot that kicked the door in.

03:15.460 --> 03:17.930
OK, say it is. Can we trace
where that's come from?

03:17.980 --> 03:20.050
- Where they've been?
- I'll narrow it down for you.

03:20.100 --> 03:21.930
Rules out Marlow and Logan, anyway.

03:21.980 --> 03:24.290
They were both in custody, weren't they?

03:25.840 --> 03:26.930
Not Marlow.

03:26.980 --> 03:28.460
No. We, um... We let him go.

03:29.820 --> 03:32.610
- Right.
- OK. I want to show you all this.

03:32.660 --> 03:34.540
- Carey?
- Yep.

03:37.100 --> 03:38.300
OK.

03:39.340 --> 03:40.980
There's Stein.

03:42.140 --> 03:46.540
Now, he meets with a group of
people, trans and otherwise.

03:48.780 --> 03:50.460
Marlow.

03:51.460 --> 03:54.260
- That's Marlow?
- Yeah.

03:56.260 --> 04:00.130
Then Marlow heads out in the
direction of the toilets.

04:00.180 --> 04:03.620
- The ladies or the gents?
- And there's Stein.

04:06.420 --> 04:08.130
Have you picked up Marlow again?

04:08.180 --> 04:10.490
I phoned his wife last night,
but she hadn't seen him,

04:10.540 --> 04:13.210
and he didn't sign back into his barracks.

04:13.260 --> 04:14.770
So, he's missing?

04:16.180 --> 04:18.170
- What about Toby Logan?
- He's come clean.

04:18.220 --> 04:21.010
Says he's worshipped
Evie Williams from afar,

04:21.060 --> 04:24.010
hence the theft from her office
and the attempted break-in.

04:25.460 --> 04:26.650
Excuse me.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.500
Ma'am.

04:30.660 --> 04:32.900
Not covering himself in glory, is he?

04:45.140 --> 04:46.900
- Have you got that?
- Yes, ma'am.

04:48.340 --> 04:50.130
The Chief Super?

04:50.180 --> 04:51.890
What did you tell her?

04:51.940 --> 04:55.490
That by the time the Lyell gave us
what they'd got, we'd let Marlow go.

04:55.540 --> 04:57.940
Now David Stein's dead because of them.

04:58.940 --> 05:00.330
Really?

05:00.380 --> 05:01.770
My job's on the...

05:01.820 --> 05:03.490
.. line here.

05:03.540 --> 05:05.770
- I'm heading back to the Lyell.
- OK, thanks.

05:05.820 --> 05:07.420
- See you.
- Yeah.

05:10.100 --> 05:13.050
Everybody who's anybody knows David Stein.

05:13.100 --> 05:14.890
Do me a favour, will you?

05:14.940 --> 05:18.890
Get Thomas Chamberlain out
of here and down the station.

05:18.940 --> 05:20.660
I need a distraction.

05:22.420 --> 05:24.140
Uh...

05:29.500 --> 05:32.700
It's a stab wound this time
rather than a slash-type wound.

05:38.540 --> 05:41.410
Centred 7cm below and 4cm in front

05:41.460 --> 05:44.930
of the right external auditory meatus.

05:44.980 --> 05:48.850
Perhaps aiming to sever
the right carotid artery.

05:48.900 --> 05:51.660
Could it be the same knife as Rico?

05:53.860 --> 05:56.410
Potentially. Similar ragged edges.

05:56.460 --> 06:00.050
So possibly serrations
on one side of the blade.

06:00.100 --> 06:03.170
But there's heavy bruising this
time to the edge of the wound,

06:03.220 --> 06:05.930
suggesting that the knife
hilt impacted with the skin.

06:05.980 --> 06:08.690
Anything... specific?

06:08.740 --> 06:11.010
Nothing that I can see externally,

06:11.060 --> 06:13.140
but I'll swab for DNA transfer.

06:14.260 --> 06:16.970
This doesn't quite hang together, does it?

06:17.020 --> 06:20.090
Similarity is Transaction,

06:20.140 --> 06:22.970
vomit, the serrated blade.

06:23.020 --> 06:25.050
But all different MOs.

06:25.100 --> 06:29.460
And why take Evie Williams
but leave the others in situ?

06:38.940 --> 06:40.980
Yeah, thanks for coming down.

06:42.300 --> 06:46.170
All it is -- I just need to clear up
a couple of things from last night.

06:46.220 --> 06:47.660
Just through here.

06:49.740 --> 06:52.530
- Do you want a coffee?
- No, no. I'm fine, thanks.

06:52.580 --> 06:55.260
- I've got to get back to the Lyell.
- OK. Please...

06:57.660 --> 06:59.610
All right, let's crack on.

06:59.660 --> 07:02.810
So, the postmortem on Rico Abbey.

07:02.860 --> 07:04.890
- You performed that
alone, didn't you? - Yeah.

07:04.940 --> 07:06.810
What is it you wanted to know?

07:06.860 --> 07:10.170
Oh! Why wasn't the GHB found
at the first screening?

07:10.220 --> 07:13.050
Well, we test for a range of drugs --

07:13.100 --> 07:14.850
amphetamines, tryptamines, cathinones --

07:14.900 --> 07:17.770
but GHB, that's not included
in any routine tox screening.

07:17.820 --> 07:20.210
So, why did you, then?

07:20.260 --> 07:23.170
- Test for it? - We'd found alcohol
in his system, as you know,

07:23.220 --> 07:25.090
but you hadn't requested
any further tests,

07:25.140 --> 07:27.410
and I've actually been
asked by the Home Office

07:27.460 --> 07:29.850
not to pursue anything that
isn't clearly indicated.

07:29.900 --> 07:32.490
As it happens, in this
case, I ignored that.

07:32.540 --> 07:36.370
I had, like, a theory about the
GHB and I wanted to pursue it.

07:36.420 --> 07:39.050
So, both Rico Abbey and David Stein

07:39.100 --> 07:42.330
- had GHB in their systems
above the normal level? - Yeah.

07:42.380 --> 07:45.450
Why didn't you just tell me
as soon as you suspected GHB?

07:45.500 --> 07:47.570
Wait a second. I followed procedure.

07:47.620 --> 07:50.980
I didn't give you a hypothesis,
that's not my job. I gave you fact.

07:52.140 --> 07:55.940
Yeah, yeah. I'm just trying to
get my head round it, that's all.

07:57.580 --> 07:58.880
That's all I'm trying to do.

08:00.060 --> 08:00.650
Yeah?

08:00.700 --> 08:02.730
The Williamses are here.

08:02.780 --> 08:04.690
- Did you ask them to come in?
- Yeah.

08:04.740 --> 08:07.740
- I'm heading out now. Yeah?
- All right. That's good.

08:10.940 --> 08:13.930
Don't let me take up
any more of your time.

08:13.980 --> 08:15.380
Right.

08:19.960 --> 08:21.980
Why didn't you do your job?

08:23.260 --> 08:25.410
Mrs Williams, Mr Williams. Come on in.

08:25.460 --> 08:26.980
Good to see you.

08:46.140 --> 08:47.370
Hello?

08:47.420 --> 08:48.850
Hi.

08:48.900 --> 08:50.540
DI Carey Murphy.

08:52.340 --> 08:54.300
- Is something wrong?
- Can I come in?

09:13.500 --> 09:14.730
Nikki?

09:14.780 --> 09:18.570
- What did Cramer want?
- He wants a scapegoat.

09:18.620 --> 09:20.250
Are we in trouble?

09:20.300 --> 09:22.410
Ah, forget it. It's been dealt with.

09:22.460 --> 09:24.090
What have you got?

09:24.140 --> 09:26.970
Well, there is bruising
around David Stein's wound,

09:27.020 --> 09:29.770
so it looks like the hilt of the
knife connected hard with the skin.

09:29.820 --> 09:32.690
OK. Enough to be able to
ID the kind of knife used?

09:32.740 --> 09:35.210
No. I've looked at Rico Abbey
again, hoping that his wound

09:35.260 --> 09:37.650
might give us more, but there's
no hilt bruising there.

09:37.700 --> 09:38.810
What about Beth Roscoe?

09:38.860 --> 09:42.490
- Nothing that we can see from the
photos taken at the hospital. - OK.

09:42.540 --> 09:45.460
Well, I'm on my way. I'll
be with you shortly, yeah?

09:49.900 --> 09:52.170
There's no violence in him.

09:52.220 --> 09:54.690
I've never seen him lose his temper.

09:54.740 --> 09:56.180
Really?

09:57.780 --> 10:00.690
- Doesn't everyone... sometimes?
- I don't mean...

10:00.740 --> 10:04.450
Yes, of course, frustration
with the kids, or whatever,

10:04.500 --> 10:05.810
but never physically.

10:05.860 --> 10:08.100
- Never violence against you?
- Never.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.530
Most of his...

10:11.580 --> 10:15.010
.. frustrations have
been directed at himself,

10:15.060 --> 10:18.490
especially in the last few
months, since he left us.

10:18.540 --> 10:21.410
So, he's been angry with himself?

10:21.460 --> 10:22.740
Yes.

10:28.020 --> 10:30.370
How are you feeling now?

10:30.420 --> 10:32.060
I don't know.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.570
Numb.

10:34.620 --> 10:36.260
I suppose I'm numb.

10:38.540 --> 10:40.770
Does he still want a
relationship with you?

10:40.820 --> 10:44.570
- Is that something he's said
that he wants? - Of a kind.

10:44.620 --> 10:47.420
What about you? What do you want?

10:49.660 --> 10:51.660
I want my husband back.

10:58.380 --> 11:00.690
What's he like with
other transgender people?

11:00.740 --> 11:03.010
I thought I explained.

11:03.060 --> 11:06.970
You don't really get this, do you? I
don't know any transgender people.

11:07.020 --> 11:10.940
- He's hidden this all
our married life. - Right.

11:12.460 --> 11:13.780
So, you...

11:14.980 --> 11:17.890
.. you kind of never knew him.

11:17.940 --> 11:19.860
Oh, I knew him.

11:22.340 --> 11:23.970
What he showed me.

11:24.020 --> 11:26.290
I knew part of him.

11:26.340 --> 11:29.100
But the man I married and...

11:31.220 --> 11:32.940
.. who he is now...

11:34.140 --> 11:36.860
.. are completely different people.

11:38.300 --> 11:42.860
And yet you're sure that
he could never be violent?

11:52.380 --> 11:54.050
Did he do this?

11:54.100 --> 11:56.260
Did he kill this person?

11:57.780 --> 11:59.650
No charges have been brought yet.

11:59.700 --> 12:01.900
That's not what I asked.

12:03.140 --> 12:05.890
Well, right now, I just
need to speak to him.

12:05.940 --> 12:07.060
So...

12:09.700 --> 12:11.530
- What have you got?
- Yeah, we got him, guv.

12:11.580 --> 12:13.180
He's just turned his phone on.

12:17.940 --> 12:21.450
- Murphy.
- Marlow's turned his mobile on.

12:21.500 --> 12:24.100
We've got his location. We
think he's on his way to Amy's.

12:25.460 --> 12:28.090
If that's Nick, don't answer
it. Where are the kids?

12:28.140 --> 12:31.130
- School and nursery. - Right, can you check
that all the doors are locked, please?

12:31.180 --> 12:32.450
Wait, what's happening?

12:37.540 --> 12:40.690
- What are you doing here?
- Murphy, what's happening?

12:40.740 --> 12:42.690
- What's going on?
- Go on upstairs.

12:42.740 --> 12:43.980
Go on.

12:45.100 --> 12:47.130
What are you doing here?

12:47.180 --> 12:48.690
Get upstairs!

12:48.740 --> 12:51.450
- What are you doing here?
- Can you hear that? Can you hear him?

12:51.500 --> 12:53.050
Yeah. Yeah, I can hear him.

12:53.100 --> 12:55.170
- How long till back-up gets here?
- Amy...

12:55.220 --> 12:56.890
- How long?
- Amy...

12:56.940 --> 12:59.010
- Two minutes.
- It's on the way.

12:59.060 --> 13:01.420
We need to talk. I need to speak to you.

13:03.260 --> 13:07.940
Will you talk to me? That's
why I'm here -- just to talk.

13:09.060 --> 13:10.330
What about?

13:10.380 --> 13:12.050
About Amy.

13:12.100 --> 13:14.530
Where's she going? Where are you going?

13:14.580 --> 13:17.410
Listen, I can help you. I can help
you find a way through all of this.

13:17.460 --> 13:18.860
Both of you.

13:20.220 --> 13:21.900
Why would you do that?

13:25.060 --> 13:26.780
Stay there, it's all right.

13:30.420 --> 13:33.530
Where have you been? We've
been looking all over for you.

13:33.580 --> 13:34.890
Out.

13:34.940 --> 13:36.930
All night? Doing what?

13:36.980 --> 13:39.050
Walking.

13:39.100 --> 13:40.700
Thinking.

13:44.100 --> 13:46.690
Amy said you phoned her, and
that's why she called me.

13:46.740 --> 13:48.930
She was just... She was worried about you.

13:48.980 --> 13:51.130
Worried? Why?

13:51.180 --> 13:52.610
This...

13:52.660 --> 13:54.570
This is still my house.

13:54.620 --> 13:56.610
- They're still my kids.
- Yeah.

13:56.660 --> 13:59.290
- No-one is saying any different.
- No-one.

13:59.340 --> 14:00.650
Down on the floor!

14:00.700 --> 14:02.370
- No! - What's he
doing? What's he doing?

14:02.420 --> 14:04.330
- Get him to put that down.
- Put it down.

14:04.380 --> 14:05.690
Put it down!

14:07.840 --> 14:08.950
Keep it down.

14:10.100 --> 14:10.700
All right?

14:12.660 --> 14:15.740
And I do need to ask you
this, and I'm... I'm sorry...

14:17.100 --> 14:19.530
.. but have you got a weapon on you?

14:19.580 --> 14:23.580
- What? No, no. No, of course no.
- All right. All right.

14:25.100 --> 14:28.090
I'm just going to come and pat
you down. Is that all right?

14:28.140 --> 14:29.660
Yeah, OK.

14:30.700 --> 14:32.060
All right?

14:38.620 --> 14:40.020
Oh, Ames...

14:48.100 --> 14:51.770
- All right. Cuff him.
- Up against the wall, please.

14:51.820 --> 14:54.500
- I just need to talk.
- Hands behind your back.

14:59.260 --> 15:01.370
Cramer says I should
have called him earlier.

15:01.420 --> 15:02.770
According to him,

15:02.820 --> 15:05.450
if I'd done my job properly, I
would have made the GHB connection

15:05.500 --> 15:07.690
immediately after Rico
Abbey's death, therefore....

15:07.740 --> 15:09.530
- David Stein would still be alive?
- Exactly.

15:09.580 --> 15:11.130
Rubbish. I could have called him,

15:11.180 --> 15:13.650
any of us could have called him,
to say we were running tests.

15:13.700 --> 15:15.730
You didn't need to. None of us needed to.

15:15.780 --> 15:18.210
- Nobody's done anything wrong here.
- That's not the issue here.

15:18.260 --> 15:20.650
The issue is whether Cramer can
get himself out of the firing line

15:20.700 --> 15:22.090
by putting me in it.

15:22.140 --> 15:25.530
Cramer got information as soon as
we had substantiated your theory.

15:25.580 --> 15:27.010
Exactly.

15:28.100 --> 15:29.730
Who's that?

15:29.780 --> 15:31.250
It's for me.

15:31.300 --> 15:33.600
Union rep. I've got to
go back down the station.

15:36.380 --> 15:38.730
I can't see there's any
case to answer here.

15:38.780 --> 15:41.290
You had the findings as
soon as they were known.

15:41.340 --> 15:43.980
What else was Professor
Chamberlain supposed to do?

15:44.980 --> 15:47.170
Let me show you this.

15:47.220 --> 15:50.850
This was recorded yesterday.

15:50.900 --> 15:52.290
Do you remember?

15:52.340 --> 15:54.090
Yeah. What of it?

15:54.140 --> 15:56.130
There's no sound, unfortunately,

15:56.180 --> 15:58.770
but can you remember what it
was we were talking about?

15:58.820 --> 16:00.940
- Why is this relevant?
- Humour me.

16:04.580 --> 16:08.930
Dr Alexander asked DI Murphy
if she thinks Marlow's guilty.

16:08.980 --> 16:13.020
She said, "Depends if
his story checks out."

16:14.140 --> 16:15.690
And you,

16:15.740 --> 16:20.210
"If her story checks out, which,
let's face it, it might well do,

16:20.260 --> 16:21.860
"let's get onto it."

16:23.540 --> 16:25.330
You've lost me.

16:25.380 --> 16:27.090
What's that supposed to prove?

16:27.140 --> 16:31.050
It's an indication as to where
Professor Chamberlain was

16:31.100 --> 16:34.340
in terms of his own
attitude towards the suspect.

16:36.340 --> 16:38.970
He'd already decided that
Nick Marlow was innocent,

16:39.020 --> 16:41.650
hence the lack of urgency
in pursuing evidence

16:41.700 --> 16:45.690
- which might well have implicated
him. - That's absurd. - Is it?

16:45.740 --> 16:47.730
He still hasn't adequately explained

16:47.780 --> 16:51.010
why he didn't immediately
inform me of the GHB test.

16:51.060 --> 16:54.090
- How many more times? I've explained.
- This won't stand up.

16:54.140 --> 16:55.770
I've got a duty of care here.

16:55.820 --> 16:58.090
And if there's been a mistake,

16:58.140 --> 17:01.330
then it's my role as
SIO to interrogate why.

17:01.380 --> 17:04.050
Oh, for God's sake, you already know why!

17:04.099 --> 17:06.250
YOU bailed Marlow.

17:06.300 --> 17:08.130
You didn't just let her go,

17:08.180 --> 17:11.450
you bailed her, therefore it
follows she was still a suspect,

17:11.500 --> 17:14.970
a suspect you released to
kill again -- potentially --

17:15.020 --> 17:17.810
despite the fact you still had
18 hours to run on the clock.

17:17.859 --> 17:21.530
To keep Marlow under lock and key,
all you had to do was what? Hmm?

17:21.579 --> 17:24.290
Precisely nothing.

17:24.339 --> 17:27.130
So, why are we wasting time with this

17:27.180 --> 17:29.290
when Evie Williams is still missing?

17:29.340 --> 17:33.420
- You're piling mistake on
mistake. It's shameful! - Wow.

17:34.900 --> 17:36.770
I'm sorry that I've had to do this.

17:36.820 --> 17:38.610
What you talking about? Do what?

17:38.660 --> 17:41.090
I have no choice but to follow regulations

17:41.140 --> 17:43.930
and make a formal complaint
to the Home Office.

17:43.980 --> 17:45.330
"No choice"?!

17:45.380 --> 17:48.490
They'll be looking into the
conduct of everyone at the Lyell,

17:48.540 --> 17:50.650
with the Detective Chief
Superintendent's backing,

17:50.700 --> 17:53.410
- and the Williamses, too.
- Getting all our ducks in line, are we?

17:53.460 --> 17:57.210
- All right. - Distracting attention
from the mess you made? - Thomas...

17:57.260 --> 17:59.290
Well, it's out of all of
our hands now, isn't it?

17:59.340 --> 18:01.700
Other processes have been set in motion.

18:24.860 --> 18:28.490
Take a look at my mobile and my laptop.

18:28.540 --> 18:32.700
There's messages on there from these
people that I've supposedly hurt.

18:34.060 --> 18:37.220
Why would I do that to
people that have helped me?

18:38.380 --> 18:41.490
So, it's just a coincidence
that you were in the bar

18:41.540 --> 18:43.450
when David Stein was, was it?

18:43.500 --> 18:44.890
No.

18:44.940 --> 18:47.290
No, a friend of mine, Kelly Hayes,

18:47.340 --> 18:49.610
invited me along with some
people from Transaction.

18:49.660 --> 18:52.330
They were worried that you
weren't doing everything you could

18:52.380 --> 18:54.010
to try and find Evie.

18:54.060 --> 18:57.970
David Stein said that he would
lobby some people in authority,

18:58.020 --> 18:59.530
try and get things moving.

18:59.580 --> 19:01.370
It's what he does.

19:01.420 --> 19:04.250
So, he arranged to meet you
and other people there. Why?

19:04.300 --> 19:06.570
For information.

19:06.620 --> 19:10.650
Who saw Evie last, what was she
doing -- that kind of thing.

19:10.700 --> 19:13.890
And then he was going to tell us
exactly what it was he could do.

19:16.940 --> 19:18.740
What did you have against him, Nick?

19:20.460 --> 19:23.770
- Did he do something to
you? - No. - So what, then?

19:23.820 --> 19:26.850
He supported me
emotionally. He was a friend.

19:26.900 --> 19:31.210
- And Rico. He supported you at
Transaction? - Yes. - And Evie?

19:31.260 --> 19:32.940
Yeah, of course.

19:33.980 --> 19:35.780
So that's what this is all about.

19:37.660 --> 19:40.770
Are you at war with
yourself, Nick? Is that it?

19:40.820 --> 19:44.130
Over your gender? So, all these
people that have helped you,

19:44.180 --> 19:45.940
did they then become your enemy?

19:49.300 --> 19:51.300
I'll ask you again.

19:52.620 --> 19:55.530
Where is Evie Williams?

19:55.580 --> 19:56.940
I don't know.

20:19.500 --> 20:22.930
- Hiya. - Hiya. I saw a
missed call. Are you OK?

20:22.980 --> 20:24.730
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Really?

20:24.780 --> 20:27.050
I heard about the wonderful DCI Cramer.

20:27.100 --> 20:28.220
Ah.

20:29.580 --> 20:33.330
Pathology's a small world, and the
police have started leaking it.

20:33.380 --> 20:35.780
So, how can I help?

20:37.380 --> 20:40.820
- That job we talked about. Is, erm...
- Is it still on the table?

20:42.580 --> 20:44.370
- Yeah.
- Very much so.

20:44.420 --> 20:47.890
Of course, all these shenanigans
might make negotiating

20:47.940 --> 20:50.490
a massive salary slightly
more challenging,

20:50.540 --> 20:53.530
but, hey, come across to the light side.

20:53.580 --> 20:57.730
Is that why you called -- to
check out the lay of the land?

20:57.780 --> 20:59.020
Yeah. Kind of.

21:00.420 --> 21:01.820
Good.

21:03.740 --> 21:05.340
Well, then?

21:06.860 --> 21:08.740
What would our next step be?

21:25.820 --> 21:27.930
DPS is happy. We've got enough.

21:27.980 --> 21:32.010
So, now let's charge him -- who
knows, maybe he'll open up a bit?

21:33.060 --> 21:34.340
And in the meantime?

21:35.580 --> 21:38.530
Are you going to continue to
pursue Professor Chamberlain?

21:38.580 --> 21:40.020
Pursue, as in...?

21:41.300 --> 21:43.570
This is not the way to do this, Martin.

21:43.620 --> 21:45.730
We both know you're
desperate to get ahead,

21:45.780 --> 21:48.680
you're so desperate you'll step
on anyone's head to get there.

21:51.620 --> 21:53.420
You messed up this time.

22:07.980 --> 22:09.180
Prick.

22:34.980 --> 22:36.500
OK, guys, listen up.

22:37.540 --> 22:41.330
I'm afraid the situation
has escalated somewhat.

22:41.380 --> 22:43.850
As you know, the Home
Office are investigating me.

22:43.900 --> 22:46.410
Now they're threatening to investigate
the Lyell, as an institution.

22:46.460 --> 22:49.090
- Meaning what, exactly?
- Meaning they're talking about examining

22:49.140 --> 22:52.130
what role everyone here
played in all of this.

22:52.180 --> 22:53.970
What began with Cramer's
accusations against me

22:54.020 --> 22:55.410
could now undermine the whole lab.

22:55.460 --> 22:57.650
- Aren't you running away with this?
- No, I'm not, Jack.

22:57.700 --> 22:59.490
I think you know it.

22:59.540 --> 23:02.730
If they come after the
Lyell, they'll mothball us.

23:02.780 --> 23:04.650
The investigation could take months,

23:04.700 --> 23:07.170
and we can't survive that
-- it'll shut us down.

23:07.220 --> 23:09.770
Can't we talk to Cramer?
Get him to withdraw?

23:09.820 --> 23:11.650
Cramer doesn't give a
damn about the Lyell.

23:11.700 --> 23:13.930
No, what I need to do is...

23:13.980 --> 23:16.970
.. I need to refocus
this back onto myself.

23:17.020 --> 23:19.330
I need to put distance between
myself and the rest of you.

23:19.380 --> 23:21.850
So, I've spoken to Susie Merrick

23:21.900 --> 23:24.890
and accepted I've the university job.

23:24.940 --> 23:27.170
- You what?
- What university job?

23:27.220 --> 23:28.570
Head of Medicine at UCL.

23:28.620 --> 23:31.650
- They offered it me a few days ago.
- You knew this, Nikki?

23:31.700 --> 23:33.810
Wait. I mentioned this
to Nikki in passing.

23:33.860 --> 23:36.930
I said I was flattered, but I
wasn't even considering taking it.

23:36.980 --> 23:39.280
There was nothing to tell
you and Jack, I swear.

23:40.780 --> 23:41.850
But now...

23:41.900 --> 23:44.570
Well, things have changed somewhat.

23:44.620 --> 23:46.850
Maybe it serves a purpose.

23:46.900 --> 23:49.690
- There has to be another way.
- There isn't.

23:49.740 --> 23:52.450
I've been through it, over and over.

23:52.500 --> 23:54.940
We won't survive an investigation.

24:23.460 --> 24:25.780
Imagine being a woman...

24:26.820 --> 24:30.500
.. and you know exactly who you
are but you're in a man's body.

24:31.980 --> 24:35.610
And no matter what you tell
people about how you feel inside,

24:35.660 --> 24:38.570
all that matters to them is
what they can see on the outside.

24:38.620 --> 24:41.090
Being truthful to who you are,

24:41.140 --> 24:43.610
to who you know who you're supposed to be,

24:43.660 --> 24:50.890
and having the honesty and the
self-respect to live life openly,

24:50.940 --> 24:57.490
to participate in society
equally -- that's so precious.

24:57.540 --> 24:59.650
And if that's not there any more,

24:59.700 --> 25:01.450
that being equal,

25:01.500 --> 25:06.130
if it's been taken away from you
because of your transgender status,

25:06.180 --> 25:09.370
then you know how it feels
to be a second-class citizen,

25:09.420 --> 25:12.660
to be treated like somebody who's
not worth what other people are.

25:14.980 --> 25:18.050
Equal opportunities,
regardless of your race,

25:18.100 --> 25:21.250
your gender, your sexuality --

25:21.300 --> 25:23.210
that isn't like a gift

25:23.260 --> 25:25.580
that's ours to bestow onto others.

25:29.500 --> 25:33.180
Living life in your own flesh, it
should be a basic human right...

25:35.220 --> 25:39.660
.. because our identity
is fundamental to us.

25:49.140 --> 25:50.890
Murphy. What can I do for you?

25:50.940 --> 25:53.370
I didn't hide anything. He said
he wasn't going to take it.

25:53.420 --> 25:54.810
Really? What gets me is that

25:54.860 --> 25:56.810
- Cramer doesn't have a
leg to stand on. - Jack!

25:56.860 --> 25:59.730
- That's not the point.
- Isn't it? - Thomas is right.

25:59.780 --> 26:02.690
We don't stand a chance of
surviving an investigation.

26:02.740 --> 26:05.580
They'll stop us working,
and we'll go under.

26:07.660 --> 26:10.410
What are you lot up to?

26:10.460 --> 26:12.370
Listen, whatever's going on internally,

26:12.420 --> 26:14.170
we still have a missing woman out there,

26:14.220 --> 26:16.970
and I've had Carey Murphy on the
phone asking me for an update.

26:17.020 --> 26:19.810
We need to get our heads together,
we need to get back to the evidence.

26:19.860 --> 26:22.620
- We still have a chance
to find Evie alive. - OK.

26:26.700 --> 26:28.490
Can I ask you something?

26:28.540 --> 26:30.250
Sure.

26:30.300 --> 26:31.610
Is this a way out for you?

26:31.660 --> 26:34.490
An excuse to walk away
from all the politics?

26:34.540 --> 26:37.770
No. I was brought here to
handle the politics, Nikki,

26:37.820 --> 26:39.620
and that's exactly what I'm doing.

27:35.380 --> 27:38.450
- Right, what have we got?
- From the soil sample

27:38.500 --> 27:42.210
we've got fly ash, soot
and red-brick fragments.

27:42.260 --> 27:45.610
All suggesting an inner-city
location, possibly industrial.

27:45.660 --> 27:48.370
And this is the mud from
the David Stein crime scene?

27:48.420 --> 27:49.610
Yes, that's right.

27:49.660 --> 27:54.090
We've also got metal flakes
composed of iron and lead.

27:54.140 --> 27:56.930
What about the soil itself?

27:56.980 --> 27:59.490
The soil texture is clay loam, primarily.

27:59.540 --> 28:04.210
Yeah. These marked areas all
conform to soils with clay,

28:04.260 --> 28:07.530
iron and lead content in
roughly the right quantities.

28:07.580 --> 28:09.250
Good.

28:09.300 --> 28:11.250
Where were the bodies found?

28:11.300 --> 28:13.100
These markers here.

28:14.380 --> 28:16.650
Can we narrow it down any further?

28:16.700 --> 28:22.260
Hopefully, the plant DNA results
will help us do just that. Yeah.

28:23.620 --> 28:25.850
Do you think Nikki will want Thomas's job?

28:25.900 --> 28:28.700
She's always said not.

28:30.420 --> 28:31.620
I'll do it.

28:34.260 --> 28:35.980
We'll both do it!

28:37.500 --> 28:38.820
No, just me.

28:41.740 --> 28:47.170
Yeah... This is mostly
anthropogenic materials.

28:47.220 --> 28:50.900
I'm just hoping this vegetable
matter will get us more.

28:52.980 --> 28:56.620
We just need to extract some plant DNA.

28:59.540 --> 29:01.340
Pop it in the oven?

29:41.340 --> 29:43.060
Thank you.

30:56.060 --> 30:57.330
What have we got, then?

30:57.380 --> 30:58.530
Results are in.

30:58.580 --> 31:01.170
It's a variety of wheat.

31:01.220 --> 31:02.490
Mm-hm?

31:02.540 --> 31:08.250
You know, wheat flowers contain
both male and female parts.

31:08.300 --> 31:10.450
As do we, in utero.

31:10.500 --> 31:12.530
The potential to be either.

31:12.580 --> 31:14.220
Or both.

31:15.340 --> 31:18.100
Hmm. Or both.

31:20.060 --> 31:22.100
Well, let's narrow it down.

31:24.140 --> 31:25.900
600 hundred possible matches.

31:39.100 --> 31:41.450
DNA results on the plant material.

31:41.500 --> 31:44.410
- It's grain -- something called...
- Hard white wheat.

31:44.460 --> 31:46.490
- Right. - We don't
grow it in this country.

31:46.540 --> 31:49.330
- It's predominantly American.
- What's it doing here?

31:49.380 --> 31:52.250
We import it for processed foods.

31:52.300 --> 31:55.090
There's somewhere I was looking at...

31:55.140 --> 31:58.730
Yeah, the soil conforms to the
geochemical profile you mentioned.

31:58.780 --> 32:00.690
This place.

32:00.740 --> 32:03.410
Empty now. They used to
make breakfast cereals there.

32:03.460 --> 32:04.740
Worth a pop?

32:05.780 --> 32:07.570
Yeah.

32:07.620 --> 32:08.900
I'll call Murphy.

32:53.340 --> 32:55.650
All right, this place
has been shut for years,

32:55.700 --> 32:58.210
so it's going to be a case
of covering it floor by floor.

32:58.260 --> 33:00.370
And, no, we haven't had
a chance to map it.

33:00.420 --> 33:02.890
- Yes, ma'am.
- Why would Evie be dumped here?

33:02.940 --> 33:05.290
The other bodies were left
where they were attacked.

33:05.340 --> 33:08.060
I know. Let's hope it's
because she's not dead yet.

33:10.940 --> 33:13.290
With me, please. OK.

33:13.340 --> 33:16.210
We're looking for areas where there
might have been grain spillage.

33:16.260 --> 33:17.530
As fast as we can.

33:17.580 --> 33:20.370
You guys take the first two
floors, you're in the basement.

33:20.420 --> 33:21.980
Thomas and Jack are with me.

33:23.220 --> 33:24.500
Murphy...

33:25.500 --> 33:26.770
Is that thing safe?

33:26.820 --> 33:28.220
Let's live a little.

33:30.140 --> 33:31.660
Evie?

33:34.820 --> 33:36.380
It's the police, Evie!

34:06.300 --> 34:07.660
Evie?

34:09.380 --> 34:11.060
Evie?

34:22.179 --> 34:24.100
Evie!

34:25.659 --> 34:27.020
Evie!

34:37.060 --> 34:38.699
Evie!

34:42.820 --> 34:44.659
Evie!

34:46.980 --> 34:49.570
So, your DCI didn't
even dare show his face?

34:49.620 --> 34:51.449
I can't get involved in this.

34:51.500 --> 34:54.570
- What, you're just going to sit
on the fence? - You don't know.

34:54.620 --> 34:59.820
What I do know is that he's a
lying bastard with no integrity.

35:11.460 --> 35:12.900
Evie!

35:29.460 --> 35:30.980
What is it I don't know?

35:32.140 --> 35:33.820
What don't I know, Murphy?

35:35.700 --> 35:38.690
Look, everyone treads
really carefully around him.

35:38.740 --> 35:41.380
He's got the ear of
some very senior people.

35:51.940 --> 35:53.050
Anything?

35:53.100 --> 35:54.700
Nah, nothing.

35:57.100 --> 35:58.460
Thomas? Murphy?

36:03.860 --> 36:05.130
Evie!

36:06.940 --> 36:08.660
Evie?

36:16.060 --> 36:17.260
It's everywhere.

36:23.180 --> 36:25.010
- There's something there!
- Hmm?

36:25.060 --> 36:26.210
- Jack!
- What?

36:26.260 --> 36:27.860
- Jack!
- Is she there?

36:35.900 --> 36:37.130
Evie?

36:37.180 --> 36:38.500
Shh... Evie!

36:41.340 --> 36:42.930
Yeah, hello. Ambulance.

36:42.980 --> 36:45.250
Fanshawe Way.

36:45.300 --> 36:46.850
E7. Yeah.

36:46.900 --> 36:48.530
It's a derelict cereal factory.

36:48.580 --> 36:49.860
Yep, hurry, please.

36:55.820 --> 36:58.290
Can we get in to preserve the evidence?

36:58.340 --> 36:59.690
They'll let you know when.

36:59.740 --> 37:01.740
Can I at least bag her clothes? Thanks.

37:11.420 --> 37:14.820
If you follow me, you
should be able to see her.

37:24.140 --> 37:25.930
We found her.

37:25.980 --> 37:27.100
Hmm?

37:28.540 --> 37:30.330
We found her, didn't we?

37:30.380 --> 37:32.100
You found her.

37:36.100 --> 37:38.300
Kind of puts everything into perspective.

37:39.780 --> 37:40.940
It does.

37:45.700 --> 37:49.010
The Williamses have given consent
and they're letting you in.

37:49.060 --> 37:51.300
- She's been sedated.
- Great.

37:59.780 --> 38:01.260
Thank you.

38:02.580 --> 38:07.090
Massive bruising to the left
side of the face, lower jaw.

38:07.140 --> 38:08.820
Particularly around the eye.

38:14.220 --> 38:19.130
Only one apparent wound --
again ragged at the edges.

38:19.180 --> 38:21.380
Fanning out at the margin.

38:26.540 --> 38:28.530
Knife just missed the artery.

38:28.580 --> 38:30.450
She's lucky to be alive.

38:30.500 --> 38:32.450
It's a similar patterning to the bruising

38:32.500 --> 38:34.220
around David Stein's stab wound.

38:44.180 --> 38:45.660
Thank you.

38:54.980 --> 38:58.380
This is the bruising we found
around Evie Williams' wound.

38:59.780 --> 39:01.650
- And this is David Stein's.
- Yep.

39:01.700 --> 39:04.810
So, if the bruising
around both these wounds

39:04.860 --> 39:08.330
was made by the hilt, are we
looking at the same knife here?

39:08.380 --> 39:11.250
Well, we could be, but we
don't have enough detail

39:11.300 --> 39:12.970
to identify the kind of knife used.

39:13.020 --> 39:15.370
- And there's no equivalent
on Rico Abbey. - No.

39:15.420 --> 39:17.770
What about Beth Roscoe?

39:17.820 --> 39:20.450
After she was attacked, the
police took these photos.

39:20.500 --> 39:22.530
What? Within hours, yeah?

39:22.580 --> 39:25.970
Any bruising wouldn't have
emerged, would it? Not by then.

39:26.020 --> 39:28.010
Let's ask her to come in.

39:28.060 --> 39:29.810
Have a look at those wounds.

39:29.860 --> 39:31.450
See if they can tell us anything else.

39:31.500 --> 39:33.290
How are you feeling?

39:33.340 --> 39:34.650
OK.

39:34.700 --> 39:35.980
At least, I think I am.

39:37.420 --> 39:38.610
This is Thomas.

39:38.660 --> 39:40.220
- Hiya.
- Hey.

39:41.300 --> 39:43.170
So, we're hoping to identify

39:43.220 --> 39:45.450
the kind of weapon that
your attacker used,

39:45.500 --> 39:49.050
and to do that, we need to
look at your wounds again.

39:49.100 --> 39:50.690
- Right.
- Would that be OK?

39:50.740 --> 39:52.140
Yeah, yeah, of course.

39:53.380 --> 39:55.860
- Can I take your coat?
- Yeah.

40:00.820 --> 40:02.460
Have a seat.

40:11.620 --> 40:14.780
- Say if anything
hurts, won't you? - OK.

40:20.260 --> 40:21.780
That's it.

40:23.060 --> 40:24.780
- Sorry.
- It's OK.

40:27.060 --> 40:28.900
- OK.
- Healing well.

40:31.180 --> 40:34.370
We'll do this as quickly as we can now.

40:37.100 --> 40:39.820
- Turn your arm for me?
- Yep.

40:41.780 --> 40:42.970
And relax.

40:43.020 --> 40:44.580
Now then, this one?

40:47.340 --> 40:49.570
- Can you bend your arm?
- Uh, yeah.

40:49.620 --> 40:50.660
That's it.

40:54.700 --> 40:58.370
- You OK? - Yeah, I just... It's
just all coming back a little.

40:58.420 --> 41:01.130
Can I... can I just get a moment, please?

41:01.180 --> 41:03.410
Yeah, I'll get these up
in the viewing gallery.

41:03.460 --> 41:06.130
Right. I'll get you a
glass of water, yeah?

41:06.180 --> 41:07.340
Yeah, thanks.

41:14.740 --> 41:16.570
There's no bruising round Beth's wounds.

41:16.620 --> 41:19.130
They aren't deep enough. The
hilt didn't touch the skin.

41:19.180 --> 41:20.460
Really? Nothing?

41:21.860 --> 41:26.130
OK, let's go back.

41:26.180 --> 41:27.890
First crime scene.

41:27.940 --> 41:30.530
Rico Abbey -- throat cut.

41:30.580 --> 41:32.210
- Second?
- David Stein.

41:32.260 --> 41:35.210
David Stein -- stabbed in the neck.

41:35.260 --> 41:36.650
- Third?
- Evie Williams.

41:36.700 --> 41:39.330
Evie Williams -- also stabbed.

41:39.380 --> 41:41.380
But not fatally.

41:43.380 --> 41:46.490
You know the only place we did
find bruising on Beth Roscoe...

41:46.540 --> 41:48.540
.. was here.

41:52.220 --> 41:55.210
- On the side of her hand.
- A defence wound?

41:55.260 --> 41:56.730
Maybe.

41:56.780 --> 41:58.660
Could it...?

41:59.780 --> 42:03.530
Could she have been holding the knife
when all the others were attacked?

42:03.580 --> 42:06.170
We have no evidence to support this.

42:06.220 --> 42:09.530
Why would she come forward and
say that she'd been attacked?

42:09.580 --> 42:11.970
Maybe she was injured
during the attack on Evie.

42:12.020 --> 42:13.890
Could she have injured herself

42:13.940 --> 42:17.650
- and come forward claiming
to be a victim? - Yeah.

42:17.700 --> 42:20.330
And given us the e-fit of Marlow
to get herself off the hook.

42:20.380 --> 42:23.850
But why, though? What's her motive?

42:23.900 --> 42:26.050
We need to be scrupulous here.

42:26.100 --> 42:27.890
It makes no sense.

42:27.940 --> 42:30.530
It does in terms of the
pathology. The GHB.

42:30.580 --> 42:33.370
Why dose your victims with a sedative?

42:33.420 --> 42:36.490
Because you're weaker than them. You
need to undermine their resistance.

42:36.540 --> 42:38.170
Is this enough evidence?

42:38.220 --> 42:40.700
Uh... She's gone.

42:43.220 --> 42:44.580
Call Murphy.

42:59.180 --> 43:00.820
Tell me about Beth Roscoe.

43:03.620 --> 43:05.770
Miss Roscoe? Hello?

43:07.580 --> 43:08.980
Are you in there?

43:12.260 --> 43:13.460
Cheers, thank you.

43:15.380 --> 43:18.250
I know you had contact with
her through Transaction.

43:18.300 --> 43:19.900
Please.

43:20.820 --> 43:23.010
I'm just trying to help you out here.

43:23.060 --> 43:25.260
And I need you to help me.

43:30.420 --> 43:33.530
I've... I've met her a few times.

43:33.580 --> 43:35.210
Never alone.

43:35.260 --> 43:37.610
So, you weren't intimate with her?

43:37.660 --> 43:39.850
What gives you that idea?

43:39.900 --> 43:43.410
She was listed as the sole
occupant of the apartment,

43:43.460 --> 43:46.570
but there seems to be evidence
of a man living there and all.

43:46.620 --> 43:48.900
You think that that's me?

43:49.940 --> 43:51.450
You know where I live.

43:51.500 --> 43:54.300
All right, so if it's not you, then who?

43:55.900 --> 43:57.700
Someone who doesn't exist any more.

43:59.140 --> 44:01.900
A ghost that she couldn't let go of.

44:03.500 --> 44:05.780
Does this ghost have a name?

44:07.860 --> 44:09.180
She's got two.

44:12.940 --> 44:14.340
Murphy.

44:17.540 --> 44:18.810
Yeah?

44:18.860 --> 44:20.380
Chris Hayes...

44:22.900 --> 44:26.020
.. and then Kelly Hayes
after her transition.

44:31.820 --> 44:35.050
I only got to know Beth
in the last few months.

44:35.100 --> 44:37.250
I only saw her and Kelly together once,

44:37.300 --> 44:40.090
that was that time at Transaction.

44:40.140 --> 44:43.610
Everything else I know
is what Kelly's told me.

44:43.660 --> 44:45.530
OK.

44:45.580 --> 44:49.890
They had been going out for a few years...

44:49.940 --> 44:52.730
.. before she transitioned.

44:52.780 --> 44:54.900
A bit like me and Amy.

44:55.940 --> 44:59.650
Except that they didn't have
kids. They partied quite hard.

44:59.700 --> 45:02.170
What do you mean, partied hard?

45:02.220 --> 45:04.100
Pills, coke, that sort of stuff?

45:05.700 --> 45:07.220
Yeah, sure.

45:10.620 --> 45:12.330
Anything harder?

45:12.380 --> 45:16.780
She was worried about her
getting into GHB too much.

45:17.780 --> 45:19.450
Murphy!

45:19.500 --> 45:22.490
She took quite a bit of
a dive after they split.

45:22.540 --> 45:25.060
Got something for you. GHB?

45:28.180 --> 45:31.450
Tell me about her reaction
to Kelly's transition.

45:31.500 --> 45:33.220
Like I said, it broke her.

45:40.300 --> 45:42.930
- Beth was angry?
- Yeah.

45:42.980 --> 45:45.380
- At Kelly?
- Of course.

45:47.140 --> 45:48.770
And the others.

45:48.820 --> 45:50.810
Others like...?

45:50.860 --> 45:52.650
Anyone that helped her transition.

45:52.700 --> 45:55.170
Jesus.

45:55.220 --> 45:57.170
Jack. Beth's not at work.

45:57.220 --> 45:59.570
- She's been tracking her.
- What?

45:59.620 --> 46:01.320
Where's Kelly? Do we know where she is?

46:02.460 --> 46:07.010
So... volunteers from
Transaction, for instance?

46:07.060 --> 46:08.610
Yeah.

46:08.660 --> 46:10.330
Give me some names.

46:10.380 --> 46:12.730
Rico Abbey?

46:12.780 --> 46:14.570
Yeah. Yeah, Rico, yeah.

46:14.620 --> 46:16.450
David Stein?

46:16.500 --> 46:17.730
Yeah.

46:17.780 --> 46:19.330
Evie?

46:19.380 --> 46:21.300
Where are you going with this?

46:28.380 --> 46:31.810
Everyone was part of the
conspiracy, according to Beth.

46:31.860 --> 46:35.530
They were polluting Chris's mind,
taking her man away from her.

46:35.580 --> 46:38.170
DI Murphy. Where's Kelly
Hayes? Is she here?

46:38.220 --> 46:41.130
- And destroying her life?
- Yeah.

46:41.180 --> 46:43.690
Evie was trying to build bridges,

46:43.740 --> 46:48.450
was trying to help her move on,
but Beth wouldn't leave it alone.

46:48.500 --> 46:51.370
It's like she was... she was... possessed.

46:51.420 --> 46:52.530
The injustice.

46:52.580 --> 46:56.810
Kelly said that she kept saying
this thing -- "the injustice".

46:56.860 --> 46:59.330
Anybody seen Kelly Hayes?

46:59.380 --> 47:03.290
- She was obsessive, then,
would you say? - Absolutely.

47:03.340 --> 47:05.010
And very angry.

47:05.060 --> 47:06.260
Yeah.

47:07.420 --> 47:08.620
Vengeful?

47:18.860 --> 47:20.500
You've made a huge mistake.

47:29.380 --> 47:31.890
- Murphy? - Yeah. I think
she's got Kelly Hayes.

47:31.940 --> 47:33.980
Beth Roscoe, I think she's got her.

47:35.020 --> 47:38.570
- Hang on a second. What?
- She's on the phone. - What?

47:38.620 --> 47:40.130
Beth Roscoe.

47:40.180 --> 47:43.220
We've got her on the phone.
I'm going to have to go, guv.

47:47.180 --> 47:49.490
Right. Get a tracer on
this call, this phone.

47:49.540 --> 47:52.890
Beth, this is DI Murphy.

47:52.940 --> 47:54.890
We've met before.

47:54.940 --> 47:56.220
Is Kelly with you?

47:58.420 --> 47:59.850
Beth?

47:59.900 --> 48:02.300
I didn't ring to speak to you.

48:03.380 --> 48:06.580
It's a helpline. I wanted help.

48:09.340 --> 48:11.220
Yeah. You can talk to me.

48:12.380 --> 48:14.810
You know what they did now, don't you?

48:14.860 --> 48:16.140
Tell me.

48:17.700 --> 48:21.730
They made it OK for him
to not... be a man.

48:21.780 --> 48:23.290
Yeah.

48:23.340 --> 48:27.250
You know, Kelly, she still wants
to be close to you, though.

48:27.300 --> 48:29.340
I don't give a shit about Kelly.

48:31.460 --> 48:33.330
I want Chris.

48:33.380 --> 48:35.970
If I can't have Chris...

48:37.940 --> 48:41.570
Is she there? Is she with you, Beth?

48:43.940 --> 48:47.170
You know, I've been trying
to get my head around it, too.

48:47.220 --> 48:49.490
You must've talked to Chris about it.

48:49.540 --> 48:52.930
Of course I've talked to Chris.
Yeah, I've talked to Chris.

48:52.980 --> 48:57.900
- What did he say?
- He said he didn't know who he was.

48:59.820 --> 49:03.930
- That I couldn't make him happy.
- Yeah, that must've hurt.

49:03.980 --> 49:05.460
He was sick.

49:06.580 --> 49:08.260
He needed help.

49:13.780 --> 49:15.540
Everybody who he turned to..

49:17.140 --> 49:19.860
.. they told him he was
OK, that he wasn't sick.

49:21.460 --> 49:24.290
They told him to destroy the man he was

49:24.340 --> 49:26.890
and to let go of what we had.

49:26.940 --> 49:29.930
All right. Just keep calm, all right?

49:29.980 --> 49:31.370
Don't do anything stupid.

49:34.500 --> 49:37.610
Listen... Listen to me.

49:37.660 --> 49:40.130
Is she there with you? Is Kelly there?

49:43.180 --> 49:46.930
I... I... I'm trying to get how you feel.

49:46.980 --> 49:49.300
I want to understand.

49:51.460 --> 49:53.290
It's not complicated.

49:53.340 --> 49:55.210
He was sick.

49:55.260 --> 49:57.250
He needed help.

49:57.300 --> 49:59.330
He needed help,

49:59.380 --> 50:02.610
not encouragement.

50:02.660 --> 50:03.700
OK.

50:05.020 --> 50:06.850
Just...

50:06.900 --> 50:10.130
Listen to me for one
minute, Beth, all right?

50:10.180 --> 50:11.900
You called Transaction...

50:13.060 --> 50:14.900
Is there something you wanted to say?

50:23.780 --> 50:25.210
You said you needed help.

50:25.260 --> 50:27.690
Is that right? Are you
being honest with me?

50:27.740 --> 50:29.930
Yeah.

50:29.980 --> 50:32.090
Yeah.

50:35.140 --> 50:38.010
Chris always knew who she was.

50:38.060 --> 50:40.500
You know that, don't you? Deep down.

50:42.300 --> 50:44.210
I know that I loved him.

50:44.260 --> 50:46.020
Check in there.

50:47.140 --> 50:51.340
In a way that you could never understand.

50:56.460 --> 50:58.250
Beth?

50:58.300 --> 50:59.900
Beth!

51:00.940 --> 51:02.810
Beth, look at me.

51:02.860 --> 51:06.420
My name's Trish, I'm here to help you.

51:07.380 --> 51:09.340
Everything's going to be OK.

51:10.420 --> 51:14.970
We can talk about whatever's
troubling you and get you help.

51:15.020 --> 51:16.890
We got her. We got her.

51:16.940 --> 51:18.730
Right.

51:18.780 --> 51:19.890
You all right?

51:19.940 --> 51:21.180
Yeah.

51:26.380 --> 51:29.740
- Thanks for taking the time
to come down. - No trouble.

51:33.300 --> 51:35.250
I hear that Cramer's no longer involved.

51:35.300 --> 51:37.140
It's his turn to be investigated.

51:38.300 --> 51:40.370
Anything to do with you?

51:40.420 --> 51:42.770
When are they letting you out?

51:42.820 --> 51:44.010
Shortly.

51:44.060 --> 51:46.090
They keep saying shortly.

51:46.140 --> 51:48.020
Red tape.

51:51.140 --> 51:54.460
I just wanted to say
thank you face to face.

51:55.580 --> 51:59.010
It's OK. The police
would've got there anyway.

51:59.060 --> 52:00.610
Do you think?

52:00.660 --> 52:03.620
How many miscarriages of justice
are there, do you reckon?

52:05.620 --> 52:08.650
You're self-effacing, but
you have to accept that

52:08.700 --> 52:12.010
she's in custody and I'm about
not to be -- it's down to you.

52:12.060 --> 52:14.850
Nah, it's a team effort.
It's always a team effort.

52:14.900 --> 52:16.970
A team that's lead by you.

52:17.020 --> 52:19.370
And from where I'm sitting, that's a...

52:19.420 --> 52:21.180
.. that's a pretty good team.

52:53.580 --> 52:55.570
This is a surprise.

52:55.620 --> 52:58.170
I thought I should let you know

52:58.220 --> 53:04.170
that I've withdrawn the complaints
against yourself and the Lyell.

53:04.220 --> 53:07.690
I've explained to the Home Office
that, on closer consideration,

53:07.740 --> 53:11.380
there was no intention on your
part to obstruct the investigation.

53:13.020 --> 53:15.050
This wasn't personal.

53:15.100 --> 53:16.940
Not personal?

53:18.300 --> 53:21.740
You made this personal the moment
you came after me and my team.

53:23.060 --> 53:24.610
So, just remember,

53:24.660 --> 53:27.730
this has got nothing to do with
me or the Lyell or DI Murphy

53:27.780 --> 53:33.020
or anyone else -- this
begins and ends with you.

53:35.580 --> 53:40.100
Now then, don't let me take
up any more of your time.

54:13.420 --> 54:17.250
- Hello. UCL. - Oh, hello. Could I
speak to Dr Susie Merrick, please?

54:17.300 --> 54:19.690
- Who's calling?
- Professor Thomas Chamberlain.

54:19.740 --> 54:22.530
- I'll just put you through.
- Thank you.

54:22.580 --> 54:23.930
Hi, Tom.

54:23.980 --> 54:25.210
Susie, hi.

54:25.260 --> 54:27.460
Uh, I thought I ought to let you know...

54:28.860 --> 54:30.900
.. I've had a change of heart.

55:17.060 --> 55:19.530
You're not saying you think
that spice should be made legal?

55:19.580 --> 55:22.130
Since it was criminalised,
it became much more dangerous.

55:22.180 --> 55:24.850
People take this to forget who they are.

55:24.900 --> 55:27.530
You got anything to help
me take the edge off?

55:27.580 --> 55:30.020
I don't want you to forget who you are.

55:32.180 --> 55:34.810
- I will not allow you to harm them.
- Get off me, bro!

55:34.860 --> 55:36.770
It's an extremely toxic opioid.

55:36.820 --> 55:40.810
You didn't want to tell him
his student was a drug dealer?

55:40.860 --> 55:43.490
It's what we think, it's not what we know.

55:43.540 --> 55:46.130
I don't want to leap to conclusions.

55:46.180 --> 55:48.410
- Want to go somewhere dark?
- Jog on.

55:48.460 --> 55:50.570
Ow!

55:50.620 --> 55:53.370
Help find the people who
sell the crystal meth,

55:53.420 --> 55:56.370
- help find the people who sell the spice.
- Something's not right.

55:56.420 --> 55:58.850
I'm looking at it, can't see
it. Something's not right.

55:58.900 --> 56:01.570
- So, we can't trace the maker?
- It's very difficult.

56:01.620 --> 56:04.220
Well, aren't you in the
business of very difficult?
