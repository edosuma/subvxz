Sweetie,
I'm sure it's nothing.

01:10.971 --> 01:13.589
When was the last time you drove
to work in the dark?

01:13.673 --> 01:15.224
- Exactly.
- That's not my point.

01:15.308 --> 01:17.476
He doesn't do this. He doesn't
call us in at the pre-crack.

01:17.543 --> 01:19.011
Who the hell keeps
texting you every day?

01:19.062 --> 01:21.713
Him, but this is different.
He left a voice message.

01:21.765 --> 01:24.049
It's gotta be life-altering.

01:24.117 --> 01:25.684
Ok, that's dramatic.

01:25.752 --> 01:27.152
Yeah, well,

01:27.220 --> 01:29.288
given this year,
I'm allowed that.

01:29.356 --> 01:31.323
It's gonna be ok.

01:33.944 --> 01:36.612
That's where we met.

01:36.696 --> 01:38.530
Right there.

01:40.967 --> 01:44.803
Look, it's important to remember
the good things about this place.

01:44.871 --> 01:46.405
I know.

01:46.473 --> 01:48.874
Because there's been a few.

01:55.298 --> 01:56.615
Go.

01:57.717 --> 01:59.551
I love you.

02:00.604 --> 02:01.854
I love you, too.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.167
Where's Hotch?

02:15.235 --> 02:16.702
Any minute.

02:16.769 --> 02:17.786
I didn't get a file
sent to me.

02:17.871 --> 02:19.305
Did a case go
directly to him?

02:19.372 --> 02:20.372
Don't know.

02:20.440 --> 02:21.457
When's the last time

02:21.541 --> 02:22.608
he called a meeting
this early?

02:22.676 --> 02:24.043
3 years, 8 months ago.

02:24.110 --> 02:25.961
And what happened?

02:26.046 --> 02:27.612
Gideon left.

02:27.664 --> 02:29.114
Who's leaving?

02:29.182 --> 02:31.884
Nobody's leaving.

02:42.262 --> 02:45.030
Come on,
get it down here!

02:49.869 --> 02:51.987
His skull is fractured.
If I can't get to him, he's gone.

02:52.072 --> 02:53.155
Help...

02:53.239 --> 02:55.190
We're gonna get you
out of there, ok?

02:55.275 --> 02:56.975
You're gonna be all right.

02:57.043 --> 02:58.344
Please...

02:58.411 --> 02:59.445
We gotta get him
out of here.

03:00.613 --> 03:03.215
Please, don't let me die.

03:03.283 --> 03:06.168
We're gonna get you out.
What's your name?

03:06.252 --> 03:07.286
Ok, Kyle.
Kyle.

03:07.337 --> 03:10.005
Is there anyone
you want me to call?

03:10.090 --> 03:12.875
Where's your phone?

03:14.527 --> 03:15.711
Hang in there, Kyle.

03:15.795 --> 03:18.063
Hang in there.

03:22.969 --> 03:25.337
I appreciate everyone
coming in early.

03:25.405 --> 03:27.439
What's going on?

03:29.509 --> 03:32.711
The Director called a meeting
last night to discuss budgets.

03:32.779 --> 03:34.446
They skipped over Strauss?

03:34.514 --> 03:36.048
She's away.

03:36.116 --> 03:38.217
The Bureau is facing
a lot of changes

03:38.284 --> 03:40.486
and this unit
is no exception.

03:40.537 --> 03:42.371
Over the next few weeks,
each of you is going to be asked

03:42.455 --> 03:44.239
if you'd like to stay
with the unit.

03:44.324 --> 03:46.358
Why wouldn't we?

03:46.409 --> 03:48.693
There are other options
for you out there.

03:48.745 --> 03:51.130
And while I want the unit
to stay together,

03:51.197 --> 03:54.800
I understand completely if you want
to see what the alternatives are.

03:54.868 --> 03:58.504
Morgan, there's renewed interest
in you from the New York office.

03:58.571 --> 04:00.639
Nobody's called me.

04:00.707 --> 04:01.940
They will.

04:02.008 --> 04:03.809
That doesn't mean
I'm gonna go.

04:03.877 --> 04:04.910
Oh, I know.

04:04.978 --> 04:06.812
Are you staying here?

04:08.014 --> 04:09.881
It's my intention.

04:09.933 --> 04:13.552
All I ask is if you are
contacted by another division

04:13.620 --> 04:14.953
that you let me know.

04:18.358 --> 04:20.058
Hotchner.

04:20.110 --> 04:21.860
Yes.

04:23.463 --> 04:25.197
Right. We can be there
in 20 minutes.

04:26.899 --> 04:29.768
Virginia State police believe
they've uncovered a serial killer.

04:29.836 --> 04:32.671
They need us at Zacha Road
and Route 7 as soon as possible.

04:32.739 --> 04:34.072
Morgan, you and Dave
get out there.

04:34.124 --> 04:35.758
What about this?

04:35.842 --> 04:38.210
We can talk about it later.

04:47.020 --> 04:49.638
They get anything from
the driver before he died?

04:49.722 --> 04:52.474
Severe head trauma.
He stopped making sense.

04:52.559 --> 04:55.811
State P.D. said they
couldn't find any I.D. anywhere.

04:55.895 --> 04:59.448
Ran his prints--nothing.

04:59.532 --> 05:01.266
Well, the guy's
gotta have a record.

05:01.317 --> 05:03.302
They're both
young and healthy.

05:03.369 --> 05:05.771
Hey, Rossi, look at
what he did to them.

05:05.839 --> 05:07.272
This can't be
his first time.

05:07.340 --> 05:10.142
Just because he's bad
doesn't mean he's been busted.

05:10.210 --> 05:11.827
What about the VIN
and plates?

05:11.911 --> 05:13.462
Running them now.

05:13.546 --> 05:16.465
Both victims seem to have on
some type of uniform.

05:16.549 --> 05:18.684
Shorts and tanks.

05:18.751 --> 05:20.118
Are we dealing
with a cult?

05:20.186 --> 05:23.639
That usually ends
in suicide, not torture.

05:23.723 --> 05:26.892
I mean,
he was beaten and strangled.

05:26.959 --> 05:30.646
She was--oh.
Completely different injuries.

05:30.730 --> 05:33.932
It looks like
more than one offender.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.335
They can't be more than
20 years old.

05:36.402 --> 05:38.070
Somebody's gotta be
missing them.

05:49.749 --> 05:51.350
Here's the thing.

05:51.417 --> 05:53.919
I can't get prints

05:53.987 --> 05:57.389
unless they're on
the missing persons list.

05:57.457 --> 06:00.843
Which they are. Jake Wattey has
been missing since December

06:00.927 --> 06:02.928
and Paige Hawley
since February.

06:02.995 --> 06:03.929
Local kids?

06:03.996 --> 06:05.330
No. Not even remotely.

06:05.398 --> 06:07.666
Jake is from Arizona,
Paige is from Ohio.

06:07.717 --> 06:09.234
Was he a junior
at Arizona state?

06:09.302 --> 06:10.736
Yeah. How did--wait.

06:10.803 --> 06:13.355
We consulted on this case
during Christmas.

06:13.439 --> 06:14.907
Yeah, he was academically
burned out.

06:14.974 --> 06:16.375
We thought it might be
a suicide.

06:16.442 --> 06:17.943
His body was never found.

06:18.010 --> 06:19.378
Until now.

06:19.445 --> 06:21.580
So how did he end up
2,000 miles away?

06:21.648 --> 06:24.149
He had been missing for months.
Why kill him now?

Hey, Morgan.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.166
Check this out.

07:37.707 --> 07:40.726
Unsub depot.

07:40.793 --> 07:41.860
He kills them,

07:41.928 --> 07:43.678
throws them
in the trunk.

07:43.763 --> 07:45.680
But why not use this

07:45.765 --> 07:47.832
wherever
he's done the deed?

07:47.884 --> 07:50.702
It's loud
and time-consuming.

07:50.770 --> 07:52.337
It'd leave a messy trail.

07:52.388 --> 07:54.239
Forensic countermeasure.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.541
Doesn't want to lead us
to where he kills them.

07:56.609 --> 07:58.343
Maybe he was gonna
bury them in the woods

07:58.394 --> 08:00.479
or dump them in the river.

08:00.546 --> 08:02.380
It's pretty damn
secluded out here.

08:02.448 --> 08:04.649
We need to figure out
what happened

08:04.700 --> 08:06.351
before they got
in the car.

08:06.402 --> 08:08.720
When was the last time
it rained out here?

08:08.788 --> 08:10.489
Do I look like
a weatherman?

08:10.556 --> 08:13.041
Come here.

08:13.126 --> 08:16.361
There's mud caked all over
the tires.

08:16.429 --> 08:17.929
That may be

08:17.997 --> 08:19.364
what was in
the victims' hair.

08:19.432 --> 08:21.500
They could have been
dragged through it.

08:21.567 --> 08:24.836
Let's find out where it was
raining in the last 24 hours.

08:27.140 --> 08:29.558
The only reason we have this
case is because of an accident.

08:29.642 --> 08:30.709
You know the odds of that?

08:30.777 --> 08:32.277
Is that rhetorical?

08:32.345 --> 08:34.546
Combined with the chance that this
is his first time dumping bodies.

08:34.597 --> 08:36.014
You think
he's working alone?

08:36.082 --> 08:37.549
What do you think?

08:37.616 --> 08:40.568
Unlikely. It's high-risk to move
one body out of state, but 2?

08:40.653 --> 08:43.188
Paige was abducted months
after having Jake in captivity,

08:43.239 --> 08:44.356
and he traveled with both,

08:44.423 --> 08:46.224
which means he's criminally
sophisticated.

08:46.292 --> 08:47.859
It seems more like
an organized operation

08:47.927 --> 08:49.594
as opposed to
an individual offender.

08:49.662 --> 08:51.396
Then he's probably
done this before.

08:51.464 --> 08:53.398
You think there are
more victims out there.

08:53.466 --> 08:55.233
Impossible to say
until we figure out

08:55.301 --> 08:57.969
how those two were targeted.

09:02.074 --> 09:03.141
Come in.

09:04.961 --> 09:08.380
Hello. This is
the information I have

09:08.431 --> 09:09.648
on the casualties
from today.

09:09.715 --> 09:11.583
I'm running open cases
from last year now.

09:11.651 --> 09:12.717
Is there anything else
you'd like me to do?

09:12.768 --> 09:14.319
No, that's all.
Thank you.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.637
Ok.

09:15.721 --> 09:18.123
Um, sir, I'm worried
that everything isn't ok,

09:18.191 --> 09:21.626
and if there's anything
you want to talk to--

09:21.694 --> 09:23.228
Garcia, well talk
about it later.

09:23.296 --> 09:25.430
Oh. Ok.

09:25.481 --> 09:28.200
Garcia, you need to widen
this search. Go back 2 years.

09:28.267 --> 09:29.634
Really? That's a lot
of people.

09:29.702 --> 09:32.154
Is there any parameters
to narrow that down?

09:32.238 --> 09:33.839
No, not yet.
Unfortunately,

09:33.906 --> 09:35.340
transporting victims
across state lines

09:35.408 --> 09:37.242
is not an issue
for this group.

09:37.310 --> 09:38.243
Group?

09:38.311 --> 09:40.245
How do you know
it's a group?

09:40.313 --> 09:41.847
We've got different genders from
different parts of the country.

09:41.914 --> 09:43.015
This is not
a traditional unsub.

09:43.067 --> 09:45.301
Come in.

09:48.072 --> 09:49.539
Hey, Andi. Uh, Garcia,

09:49.606 --> 09:50.990
this is SSA Andi Swan.

09:51.075 --> 09:53.176
She's the head of the Domestic
Trafficking Task Force.

09:53.243 --> 09:54.210
Andi, this is--

09:54.277 --> 09:55.444
Penelope Garcia.

09:55.496 --> 09:58.514
I went to your online trafficking
seminar last fall.

09:58.582 --> 09:59.982
You terrify me.

10:00.050 --> 10:02.151
Sorry.
I do remember you.

10:02.219 --> 10:03.152
Uh-uh. Really?

10:03.220 --> 10:04.687
You asked great questions.

10:04.755 --> 10:06.589
I thought you nicked
my power point.

10:06.657 --> 10:08.157
I didn't, but I could.

10:08.225 --> 10:09.359
So I've heard.

10:09.426 --> 10:11.294
I will get you that list.

10:11.362 --> 10:12.729
Let me know if you need
anything else.

10:12.796 --> 10:14.063
Very nice to see you again.

10:14.131 --> 10:15.498
You, too.

10:16.600 --> 10:19.001
She's not easy to forget.

10:19.069 --> 10:20.203
No. So how are you?

10:20.270 --> 10:21.270
Tired.

10:21.338 --> 10:22.772
Human trafficking
is a growth industry

10:22.840 --> 10:24.874
and I've got half the agents
I had last year.

10:24.942 --> 10:26.843
How can we help?

10:26.910 --> 10:28.378
I get notifications
on body discoveries

10:28.445 --> 10:30.363
of 18- to 24-year-olds.

10:30.481 --> 10:32.048
Paige Hawley and Jake Wattey.

10:32.116 --> 10:34.650
I got a theory on what happened.
Can I fill you in?

10:34.718 --> 10:35.869
Sure. We got case boards
set up in the conference room.

10:35.934 --> 10:37.482
Any chance we'll be
passing a coffee pot?

10:37.507 --> 10:38.707
Yeah.

10:43.193 --> 10:45.895
Do you know who did this?

10:45.963 --> 10:48.231
I've been 2 steps behind
an organization

10:48.298 --> 10:50.183
that abducts college kids
throughout the U.S.

10:50.267 --> 10:51.734
How long have
you been tracking them?

10:51.802 --> 10:53.669
3 years. But this
is the first time

10:53.737 --> 10:55.705
there's been
an identifiable body.

10:55.773 --> 10:57.306
- Do you think this is their work?
- It's definitely their type.

10:57.374 --> 10:59.409
Stressed-out,
vulnerable kids.

10:59.476 --> 11:01.744
They're all from good families,
making them low-risk for abduction.

11:01.812 --> 11:03.246
Young innocents
are worth more money.

11:03.313 --> 11:04.914
And they're harder to lure,
so they hold on to them

11:04.982 --> 11:06.015
for a longer period of time.

11:06.116 --> 11:07.283
How many victims
are they holding at once?

11:07.351 --> 11:08.584
That's hard to say.

11:08.652 --> 11:10.086
But from what I can tell,
there's a lot of turnover.

11:10.154 --> 11:12.522
Customers don't want to see
the same faces twice.

11:12.589 --> 11:15.525
We don't think they travel with more
than a handful of victims at one time.

11:15.592 --> 11:17.427
They hunt all over the country.

11:17.494 --> 11:19.028
All they need is a car.

11:19.096 --> 11:20.696
They might be low-tech,
but they're organized.

11:20.764 --> 11:22.298
And profitable.

11:22.399 --> 11:24.033
The rumor is that they
hold events for 2 days

11:24.101 --> 11:25.902
in metropolitan areas
and then they disappear.

11:25.969 --> 11:28.104
What kind of events?

11:28.172 --> 11:30.006
Where top-paying customers
can do things like this

11:30.057 --> 11:32.008
and worse to the victims.

11:32.059 --> 11:33.509
It seems impossible to trace.

11:33.577 --> 11:35.545
We study their behavior.

11:35.612 --> 11:37.613
They're not a good breed,
but they're still human.

11:37.681 --> 11:39.098
They make a few mistakes.

11:39.183 --> 11:41.050
We've also recently
established an undercover unit.

11:41.118 --> 11:42.885
Wait, how can you
infiltrate them?

11:42.953 --> 11:45.421
Wouldn't your agents have to commit a
crime to be accepted as a customer?

11:45.489 --> 11:46.989
Exactly. That's why
we can't pose as buyers.

11:47.057 --> 11:50.109
The entire system is set up
to protect the customers,

11:50.194 --> 11:52.094
but there's no way we can
trace them from that end.

11:52.162 --> 11:53.696
Your agents
go in as targets.

11:54.028 --> 11:55.061
Do you have anybody
under now?

11:55.129 --> 11:56.496
Locally a few.

11:56.564 --> 11:59.132
They're still establishing
the backstories.

11:59.200 --> 12:00.533
They might be able to help.

12:00.601 --> 12:01.968
I'll call.

12:03.187 --> 12:04.871
What did you do with Lucy?

12:04.939 --> 12:07.674
What did you
do with her?

12:07.742 --> 12:09.075
- Where is she?
- Shh!

12:09.143 --> 12:11.811
Kyle should be back.
He missed the last 2 calls.

12:11.862 --> 12:13.680
He likes that part.

12:13.748 --> 12:15.065
Takes his time with it.

12:15.149 --> 12:17.217
It never takes him
this long.

12:17.284 --> 12:18.551
Did he set up
the scanners?

12:18.619 --> 12:19.986
Not here.

12:20.054 --> 12:21.071
Please...

12:21.155 --> 12:22.455
What are you doing?

12:22.523 --> 12:23.823
Oh!

12:45.446 --> 12:48.314
Tank's 3/4 full.

12:48.382 --> 12:51.101
Well, it says here
capacity's 18 gallons.

12:51.185 --> 12:52.652
15 miles per gallon.

12:52.720 --> 12:56.322
So he used 1/4 tank.
He must have fueled up about 70 miles ago.

12:56.390 --> 12:57.924
Ok, Reid.

12:57.992 --> 13:00.226
What's the mileage?

13:00.294 --> 13:04.030
33,823.

13:04.081 --> 13:06.266
On a 2011? What the
hell's he been doing?

13:06.333 --> 13:09.769
Crossing state lines.
Looks like he enjoys the long way.

13:09.837 --> 13:11.738
Avoids interstates.
No GPS.

13:11.806 --> 13:13.273
No cell phone.

13:13.340 --> 13:14.908
Low-tech.
Nothing traceable.

13:14.975 --> 13:16.442
But if he's working
with a group

13:16.510 --> 13:17.911
and he has no phone,
how's he checking in?

13:26.020 --> 13:26.936
Yeah.

13:27.021 --> 13:28.271
Roanoke.

13:28.355 --> 13:29.355
What?

13:29.423 --> 13:30.690
Big storm.

13:30.757 --> 13:32.025
You run the registration?

13:32.092 --> 13:33.259
Of course I did.
And it's bogus.

13:33.310 --> 13:35.028
Led to a guy
who's been dead 3 years.

13:35.095 --> 13:37.297
Do you really think these
ratfinks that are dumping bodies

13:37.364 --> 13:38.931
in the middle of nowhere
would leave a paper trail?

13:38.983 --> 13:40.466
Hey, you ok?

13:40.534 --> 13:42.318
No. Clearly I am not.

13:42.403 --> 13:43.453
Ok, so talk to me.

13:43.537 --> 13:45.839
I am sick of the sickos.

13:45.906 --> 13:47.457
And?

13:47.541 --> 13:49.442
There has got to be
more to life

13:49.510 --> 13:51.110
than being surrounded
by this.

13:51.178 --> 13:52.445
Ok, whoa, whoa,
slow down.

13:52.513 --> 13:54.447
Since when is Penelope
Garcia gonna throw in the towel?

13:54.515 --> 13:55.815
Since exactly now.

13:55.883 --> 13:58.184
Baby girl, listen to me.
I know you're upset.

13:58.252 --> 14:00.253
So am I. But what you're
trying to do right now

14:00.321 --> 14:01.921
is distance yourself
from any more loss,

14:01.989 --> 14:03.289
and I get it.
I do the same thing.

14:03.357 --> 14:04.891
I am not some unsub
that you can try to relate to

14:04.958 --> 14:06.092
and then break down.

14:06.143 --> 14:07.760
You have every right
to be angry,

14:07.828 --> 14:09.262
but there's really
nothing you can do.

14:09.313 --> 14:11.097
No, Derek, you do not
understand me.

14:11.148 --> 14:14.133
I don't like change.
I have major control issues.

14:14.185 --> 14:16.102
No, say it ain't so.

14:16.170 --> 14:17.637
Not you.

14:17.705 --> 14:20.139
I just made you smile,
didn't I?

14:20.191 --> 14:21.608
Maybe.

14:22.610 --> 14:23.710
Good.

14:23.777 --> 14:25.178
I hate you.

14:25.246 --> 14:27.363
This group needs space
and solitude,

14:27.448 --> 14:28.982
especially if they're
holding multiple victims.

14:29.049 --> 14:31.050
These two lived thousands
of miles apart

14:31.118 --> 14:33.052
but were somehow
both targeted.

14:33.120 --> 14:35.989
They send scouts to
campuses, malls, clubs.

14:36.056 --> 14:37.490
Yeah, they go with
a shopping list,

14:37.558 --> 14:39.959
but rarely do they take more
than one victim from a city.

14:40.027 --> 14:43.329
The victims are assets.
Why would the unsubs kill their profit?

14:43.397 --> 14:45.164
Maybe the victims
are escaping,

14:45.232 --> 14:47.133
or their clients
are adapting.

14:47.201 --> 14:48.134
Adapting?

14:48.202 --> 14:50.236
These clients are
extremely depraved.

14:50.304 --> 14:51.905
When the act of sex
isn't enough for them anymore,

14:51.972 --> 14:54.173
they may be demanding
more extreme forms of release.

14:54.241 --> 14:55.742
Which was my fear.

14:55.809 --> 14:57.193
And these two
just proved it.

14:59.313 --> 15:00.396
Swan.

15:05.286 --> 15:07.403
Change of plans.

15:07.488 --> 15:08.955
We're starting early.

15:13.994 --> 15:15.461
What is it?

15:15.529 --> 15:18.498
One of my U.C.s missed
her last two check-ins.

15:26.874 --> 15:29.142
Oh!

15:48.562 --> 15:50.930
No, no...

15:50.998 --> 15:52.398
Ohh...

16:02.891 --> 16:05.009
When exactly did you
talk to her?

16:06.028 --> 16:08.688
That's 34 hours ago
and that's unacceptable.

16:08.998 --> 16:12.367
This is why
we have check-ins.

16:12.418 --> 16:14.402
We're on our way
to her place right now.

16:14.470 --> 16:18.423
Don't. Trust me, it's better
that you're not in front of me.

16:18.508 --> 16:20.926
Andi, you don't know
for sure that she was taken.

16:21.010 --> 16:22.928
My job is to expect
the worst right now,

16:23.012 --> 16:24.896
and that means she was.

16:24.981 --> 16:28.883
And she's in there with no wire,
no weapon, and no backup.

16:28.935 --> 16:30.435
What's her name?

16:30.520 --> 16:33.021
Renee.

16:33.072 --> 16:34.439
Matlin.

16:34.524 --> 16:37.492
She's only 25.

16:37.560 --> 16:40.896
She probably asked the wrong
person the right question.

16:40.963 --> 16:43.098
There was no way of
knowing she'd do that.

16:43.166 --> 16:47.085
We had no indication from intel that
this group was even in the area.

16:47.170 --> 16:49.955
She had to be following
her own lead.

16:50.039 --> 16:51.923
Well, her initiative
is why you hired her.

16:52.008 --> 16:54.242
Probably reminded you
of someone.

16:54.293 --> 16:58.096
Yeah. Which is why I should
have seen the downfalls.

16:58.181 --> 17:01.883
Trying to be a hero.
It doesn't always work out.

17:04.720 --> 17:06.454
When were they killed?

17:06.521 --> 17:08.123
Best guess is 8 hours ago.

17:08.191 --> 17:12.294
Skin abrasions say he got a bare-knuckle
beating before he was strangled.

17:12.361 --> 17:13.828
What about her?

17:13.896 --> 17:16.698
Shallow cuts
look like torture,

17:16.766 --> 17:18.032
but the fatal one was quick.

17:18.099 --> 17:19.434
Severed carotid.

17:19.502 --> 17:21.169
They had bruising around
both of their necks,

17:21.237 --> 17:22.904
their arms, and legs.

17:22.954 --> 17:25.173
So they were
dragged around.

17:25.241 --> 17:26.473
No sign of other restraints.

17:26.541 --> 17:28.476
Rossi.

17:28.544 --> 17:32.147
This unsub's hands
must be huge.

17:32.215 --> 17:33.615
They've got mud
and dirt on them,

17:33.683 --> 17:36.318
but no signs of
being held for months.

17:36.385 --> 17:40.121
I gotta tell you, they don't
look like typical missings.

17:40.189 --> 17:42.624
I usually see malnutrition
and vitamin deficiencies,

17:42.692 --> 17:44.359
but not here.

17:44.427 --> 17:46.027
They were taken care of.

17:46.128 --> 17:47.562
Preliminary blood results

17:47.630 --> 17:50.599
confirm he's got high levels
of sildenafil citrate.

17:50.666 --> 17:53.401
Commonly used for
erectile dysfunction.

17:53.469 --> 17:55.470
Not surprising. Probably
uppers and downers, too.

17:55.538 --> 17:58.707
Yes. And she has mifepristone

17:58.774 --> 18:00.358
and misoprostol
in her system.

18:00.443 --> 18:01.543
What's that?

18:01.611 --> 18:03.445
She just had
a medical abortion.

18:05.948 --> 18:07.716
Can I ask
what's going on here?

18:07.783 --> 18:10.502
We think they may be victims
of a trafficking ring.

18:10.586 --> 18:13.955
Evidence points there,
except...

18:14.023 --> 18:15.290
What?

18:15.358 --> 18:17.859
Why would they take
such good care of them

18:17.927 --> 18:19.661
and then turn around
and kill them?

18:21.430 --> 18:25.166
Here are the missing
coeds since 2009.

18:25.217 --> 18:26.434
Wow.

18:26.502 --> 18:29.721
Ok, uh, we still need
to narrow this down.

18:29.805 --> 18:32.440
Let's look at last-known locations.
Maybe there's an overlap.

18:32.508 --> 18:33.892
They're from
all over the place.

18:33.976 --> 18:37.379
These guys hunt
in target-rich environments.

18:37.446 --> 18:39.614
Right. Clubs, malls,
that kind of thing.

18:39.682 --> 18:40.865
What are Morgan and Rossi
finding?

18:40.950 --> 18:42.400
Uh, a lot of mud on
the car and the victims.

18:42.485 --> 18:43.785
Mud? Did it rain here?

18:43.853 --> 18:45.887
No, not here. South.

18:45.955 --> 18:48.290
Morgan has a theory that
based on the gas mileage,

18:48.357 --> 18:50.792
they must have filled up
within 70 miles of the accident.

18:50.860 --> 18:52.377
Gotcha. How many
gas stations you find?

18:52.461 --> 18:53.461
- 42.
- How'd you narrow that down?

18:53.529 --> 18:54.796
- I didn't.
- Why not?

18:54.864 --> 18:55.964
I didn't have
any more parameters.

18:56.032 --> 18:57.599
Never stopped you
before.

18:59.235 --> 19:00.502
I'll be right back.

19:01.904 --> 19:03.672
Thanks, Reid.

19:03.723 --> 19:05.090
What was Renee's cover?

19:05.174 --> 19:08.226
Uh, junior at George Mason
University.

19:08.311 --> 19:09.644
Worked the student union.

19:09.712 --> 19:12.714
Just simple 9 to 5.
She needs her nights and weekends

19:12.782 --> 19:14.115
to go out and find
these guys.

19:14.183 --> 19:15.350
How many U.C.s do you have?

19:15.401 --> 19:18.153
We got dozens
all over the country.

19:19.989 --> 19:21.589
You recruited them all yourself?

19:21.657 --> 19:22.657
Yeah.

19:25.578 --> 19:27.595
Hey, she was onto something.

19:28.664 --> 19:31.399
Her Internet history's
been cleared.

19:31.450 --> 19:34.202
It's just a habit
of hers.

19:34.253 --> 19:36.871
What was the last thing
she said to her handler?

19:36.939 --> 19:40.709
Uh, "home. Safe. All good."
That's it.

19:40.776 --> 19:44.346
So something must have
happened yesterday morning.

19:49.285 --> 19:50.719
Is she a runner?

19:51.721 --> 19:52.887
Avid.

19:52.955 --> 19:55.724
You see any running shoes
anywhere?

19:57.126 --> 19:58.326
No.

20:09.171 --> 20:10.739
Hi, sweetheart.

20:10.806 --> 20:13.408
Dad and I are thinking
about getting to Florida

20:13.476 --> 20:15.143
the weekend before
Johnny's wedding.

20:15.211 --> 20:18.947
I know it's a long shot, but
we were hoping you could join.

20:19.014 --> 20:23.184
You've been working so hard,
and it's only a week.

20:23.252 --> 20:25.053
Talk to your boss.

20:25.121 --> 20:27.389
But if you want.

20:27.490 --> 20:32.127
This isn't a pressure call,
it's just, well, we miss you.

20:32.194 --> 20:34.962
They get to see you
all the time, and we...

20:36.132 --> 20:38.199
Your brother's treatments
will be over,

20:38.267 --> 20:40.802
and so it'd be a reunion.

20:40.870 --> 20:42.670
Just us. Like old times.

20:42.738 --> 20:43.772
What do you think?

20:43.839 --> 20:45.340
Call me back.

20:45.408 --> 20:47.242
Love you.

20:49.078 --> 20:51.980
She's marked an article about
upcoming marathons in D.C.

20:52.047 --> 20:53.515
Maybe she was in training.

20:53.582 --> 20:55.850
She's too cautious.
She wouldn't run alone,

20:55.918 --> 20:57.285
and she'd never
run at night.

20:57.353 --> 20:58.820
If she went,
she went in the morning.

20:58.888 --> 21:00.522
What are her brother's
treatments for?

21:00.589 --> 21:02.724
Hodgkin's.

21:02.792 --> 21:04.559
She might be running
for the cause.

21:04.627 --> 21:07.962
We could find out if she showed up
for a group run yesterday morning.

21:08.030 --> 21:11.299
All that from a pair
of missing sneakers.

21:11.367 --> 21:13.351
Garcia, find out
everything you can

21:13.436 --> 21:15.103
about marathon
training groups in Manassas.

21:15.171 --> 21:16.304
Yes, sir.

21:16.355 --> 21:18.506
And focus on any groups
that fund-raise for cancer.

21:18.557 --> 21:19.691
Thanks. Bye.

21:19.775 --> 21:20.708
Hey.

21:20.776 --> 21:22.710
Reid says we have
a missing undercover?

21:22.778 --> 21:24.512
Yeah. Andi Swan's Agent.

21:24.580 --> 21:26.364
Her name's Renee Matlin.
She's 25.

21:26.449 --> 21:28.683
She's been undercover
for about a year.

21:28.734 --> 21:31.553
Entry level. She couldn't have
got that far into the world.

21:31.620 --> 21:33.571
Yeah, then
how'd she get taken?

21:33.656 --> 21:35.690
Well, knowing Swan, she hired
somebody just like her. Driven.

21:35.758 --> 21:37.024
You know her, too?

21:37.076 --> 21:38.426
We consulted
a long time ago.

21:38.494 --> 21:40.895
You got any leads
on the gas stations?

21:40.963 --> 21:41.913
7.

21:41.997 --> 21:43.298
Damn.

21:43.365 --> 21:45.900
But, the kind that sells
this egg and cheese sandwich

21:45.968 --> 21:48.586
and Cramer's coffee--
there's only one.

21:48.671 --> 21:50.405
Yes, there is.

21:50.473 --> 21:51.890
You good?

21:51.974 --> 21:53.374
Better now.

21:54.677 --> 21:56.945
Thanks for visiting.

22:03.319 --> 22:04.986
Most people pay cash
nowadays.

22:05.054 --> 22:07.155
I had to start charging
more for credit cards.

22:07.223 --> 22:10.558
Well, in these hard times,
people pay what, 30-40 bucks?

22:10.609 --> 22:11.759
That's about right, yeah.

22:11.827 --> 22:13.244
Yeah, well, this guy
would have filled up his tank,

22:13.329 --> 22:14.262
probably spent 80.

22:14.330 --> 22:15.580
Your partner just did that.

22:18.033 --> 22:19.968
What are you looking at?

22:20.035 --> 22:22.737
I got a monitor
down here.

22:22.805 --> 22:25.456
They got cameras.

22:25.541 --> 22:27.342
There.

22:31.747 --> 22:33.214
Back it up.

22:34.416 --> 22:36.784
He already paid.

22:36.852 --> 22:39.220
Where's he going?

22:43.926 --> 22:45.977
What's around this corner?

22:46.061 --> 22:48.329
Bathrooms. They've been out of
order for a couple days, though.

22:48.397 --> 22:50.481
My boss won't give me
any money to fix them.

22:53.068 --> 22:55.286
It's a pay phone.

23:00.209 --> 23:01.125
Hello.

23:01.210 --> 23:02.627
Hey, I need you, baby girl.

23:02.711 --> 23:04.178
I need to be needed.

23:04.246 --> 23:05.980
Can you pull outgoing calls
from a pay phone?

23:06.048 --> 23:08.917
Is that hypothetical?
Give me the digits.

23:08.968 --> 23:10.051
Let me see. It's, uh,

23:10.118 --> 23:13.087
703-555-0123.

23:14.857 --> 23:16.791
Ok. Outgoing call at 6:04 a.m.

23:16.859 --> 23:18.660
To a local number,

23:18.727 --> 23:20.028
which is a pay phone.

23:20.095 --> 23:21.563
Is it close by?

23:21.630 --> 23:22.830
Pharmacy's 3 miles away.

23:22.898 --> 23:24.299
Well, these guys
cover their tracks.

23:24.366 --> 23:25.733
The don't even use
disposable cells.

23:25.801 --> 23:26.901
Sorry I couldn't be more help.

23:26.969 --> 23:28.202
No, actually, you did.

23:28.270 --> 23:29.938
Local calls tell me that
they're not in the middle

23:29.989 --> 23:32.607
of their journey. Those kids were
killed somewhere close to here.

23:32.675 --> 23:33.741
Thanks, mama.

23:36.845 --> 23:39.113
Renee's group confirms that
she was there yesterday,

23:39.164 --> 23:40.648
but she ran with
a friend. She was late.

23:40.716 --> 23:41.649
A woman?

23:41.700 --> 23:42.951
Another brunette.

23:43.002 --> 23:45.319
They may have
taken her, too.

23:47.172 --> 23:49.090
Please!

23:49.158 --> 23:51.659
Somebody!

23:51.727 --> 23:52.827
Renee, be quiet.

23:52.895 --> 23:54.662
They're gonna hear you.

23:54.730 --> 23:57.065
Lucy, can you see
any of them?

23:57.132 --> 24:01.569
No, I don't. Do you?

24:01.637 --> 24:03.137
No.

24:06.942 --> 24:08.359
Where did you get that?

24:08.444 --> 24:10.778
I found it. Go on.

24:15.451 --> 24:17.385
I can't find a way out.

24:17.453 --> 24:19.354
Yeah, I'm trying.

24:19.421 --> 24:22.190
I--I think
they're down the hall.

24:22.257 --> 24:25.259
There are 6 of them
and 7 of us.

24:26.862 --> 24:28.463
Well, maybe we can take them.

24:28.530 --> 24:29.564
No.

24:29.632 --> 24:33.885
No. That's why
they're sedating us.

24:33.969 --> 24:37.405
What do you think's
gonna happen?

24:37.473 --> 24:39.741
They're gonna sell us.

24:42.845 --> 24:44.212
Wait.

24:45.848 --> 24:47.598
Please, don't take her.

24:47.683 --> 24:49.434
Don't take her.

24:49.518 --> 24:51.586
Don't take her.

24:51.654 --> 24:53.237
Renee's done a lot of homework.

24:53.322 --> 24:55.073
These people have all been
to clubs over the weekend

24:55.157 --> 24:56.190
and vanished within 3 days,

24:56.258 --> 24:57.592
including
this morning's victims.

24:57.660 --> 25:00.028
So why didn't she
share her theory?

25:00.095 --> 25:01.562
She's a perfectionist.

25:01.630 --> 25:03.965
I'm sure she wanted to gather
enough intel to prove it.

25:04.033 --> 25:05.833
Using the club as a template,
there are potentially

25:05.901 --> 25:08.002
63 others who were taken
by the same offenders.

25:08.070 --> 25:10.421
There's no way to know
which ones are still alive.

25:10.506 --> 25:11.906
Andi Swan.

25:11.957 --> 25:13.574
- How you been?
- Better.

25:13.642 --> 25:14.642
Thanks for helping out.

25:14.710 --> 25:15.677
Nice to see you again, Andi.

25:15.744 --> 25:17.445
What'd you find?

25:17.513 --> 25:20.048
We tracked the driver to a gas
station outside Culpepper.

25:20.115 --> 25:22.417
He used a pay phone to call
another one in the same town.

25:22.484 --> 25:24.752
- So they're close.
- And careful.

25:24.820 --> 25:26.788
What's their budget
on location?

25:26.855 --> 25:30.058
Not much.
They pay cash, no questions asked.

25:30.125 --> 25:31.993
Security's top priority.

25:32.061 --> 25:35.096
So this guy's found a place
to hold, what, a dozen victims?

25:35.164 --> 25:37.799
So we're looking for
a secluded spot

25:37.866 --> 25:39.650
in rural Virginia.

25:39.735 --> 25:42.036
Well, that shouldn't
be hard to find.

26:59.398 --> 27:01.816
Welcome back, everyone.

27:12.696 --> 27:15.663
I thought traffickers
concentrated in port cities.

27:15.666 --> 27:17.233
International ones do.

27:17.284 --> 27:19.602
Unfortunately, domestic traffickers
abduct all over the country.

27:19.670 --> 27:22.088
It doesn't seem like they stay in one
location long after an abduction.

27:22.173 --> 27:24.707
They move quickly
and efficiently.

27:24.759 --> 27:27.644
My guess was in a nondescript
car, and until this morning

27:27.711 --> 27:29.312
that was just a theory.

27:29.380 --> 27:30.980
They've lost their driver now,
so they're in jeopardy.

27:31.048 --> 27:32.882
It's all about survival for them.
They'll move out tonight.

27:32.950 --> 27:34.751
But they've got customers
and victims lined up.

27:34.819 --> 27:36.252
They don't want
to lose the money.

27:36.320 --> 27:38.421
And their location hasn't
been compromised yet.

27:38.472 --> 27:39.589
Who knows where
they're gonna end up?

27:39.657 --> 27:40.940
Based on Reid's theory,
we need to see

27:41.025 --> 27:43.226
if Renee had been to any clubs
before she disappeared.

27:43.294 --> 27:44.627
She went to
the local clubs.

27:44.695 --> 27:47.630
She'd report back if anyone
suspicious approached her.

27:47.698 --> 27:49.599
We followed the leads,
nothing panned out.

27:49.667 --> 27:51.100
What was the last club?

27:51.168 --> 27:53.153
Scotty's in Georgetown.

27:53.237 --> 27:56.539
If they find out
she's an agent, she's dead.

28:14.791 --> 28:18.428
Pretty impressive.
He's still standing.

28:21.365 --> 28:23.633
Ha ha ha!

28:34.812 --> 28:38.081
This team's got to be very
well-coordinated to be pulling this off.

28:38.148 --> 28:40.316
They're cohesive and loyal.

28:40.384 --> 28:42.585
The promise of money
motivates them to be efficient.

28:42.653 --> 28:44.020
And so does fear.

28:44.088 --> 28:45.788
What are your thoughts
about who the leader might be?

28:52.930 --> 28:54.197
She won't shut up.

28:54.265 --> 28:55.632
She's got the others
wound up.

28:55.699 --> 28:56.833
Well, give her something.

28:56.901 --> 28:57.901
How much?

28:57.968 --> 29:00.803
You want her
to walk, right?

29:04.041 --> 29:05.725
Stay here.

29:10.447 --> 29:13.182
We need to look at this
from the leader's point of view.

29:13.234 --> 29:14.701
A group like this
requires a strong leader.

29:14.785 --> 29:18.488
Yeah, this guy's in charge
of some unstable personalities.

29:18.556 --> 29:19.706
Do you have
any theories?

29:19.790 --> 29:21.190
I have always thought
he led through fear.

29:21.258 --> 29:22.392
This guy can blackmail
his whole team.

29:22.459 --> 29:24.077
Look at the progression
of this network.

29:24.161 --> 29:27.764
They started abducting victims for
sex and then adapted to killing.

29:27.831 --> 29:29.732
Because he saw the growth
potential in his assets.

29:29.800 --> 29:31.734
Instead of just disposing of
them, he made it into a show.

29:31.802 --> 29:33.570
And that's why
the victims are so young.

29:33.637 --> 29:36.506
The customers will pay top
dollar to see them tortured.

29:36.557 --> 29:38.708
The average guy doesn't have that
kind of money laying around.

29:38.776 --> 29:40.743
So they're successful.

29:40.811 --> 29:42.729
And incredibly deviant.
That's their big secret.

29:42.813 --> 29:44.781
If it was revealed,
they'd be ruined.

29:44.848 --> 29:46.616
Wouldn't they have to criminally
prove themselves to join the club?

29:46.684 --> 29:48.551
If they're upstanding citizens,
how do they do that?

29:48.602 --> 29:50.853
It could be a white-collar
crime, like money laundering.

29:50.921 --> 29:53.055
That's often done
through real estate.

29:53.107 --> 29:55.592
Garcia, who owned the clubs
where the victims went missing?

29:55.659 --> 29:56.960
Bruce Harmon owns
the club in Arizona.

29:57.027 --> 29:59.329
- And in Ohio?
- Bob Moore.

29:59.396 --> 30:00.396
And Scotty's
in Georgetown?

30:00.464 --> 30:02.115
Bob Moore is
a partner in that.

30:02.199 --> 30:04.267
Do any of them own property
in Virginia?

30:04.335 --> 30:08.237
Moore also is a partner in the
development of a private facility.

30:08.305 --> 30:09.772
What happened to it?

30:09.840 --> 30:12.208
It looks like bad guys
go through hardship, too.

30:12.276 --> 30:13.626
Financiers pulled
all the money out in 2009,

30:13.711 --> 30:15.078
so it's not anything.

30:15.112 --> 30:16.446
What was it?

30:16.513 --> 30:19.882
It was supposed to be a tough-love
rehab center, but now--

30:19.950 --> 30:22.819
now it's just an abandoned factory
in the middle of nowhere.

30:22.886 --> 30:24.721
With a lot of acreage
and mud.

30:24.772 --> 30:25.822
How close
to the gas station?

30:25.889 --> 30:27.557
- 8 miles west of it.
- Let's go.

30:33.530 --> 30:35.999
I'm gonna get you
out of here.

30:36.066 --> 30:37.333
Hey, how did you get out?

30:37.401 --> 30:39.636
I think there's a door
down there.

30:39.703 --> 30:41.771
No, they keep that door
guarded at all times.

30:41.822 --> 30:43.506
We gotta use the other one.

30:43.574 --> 30:44.507
What about outside?

30:44.575 --> 30:46.576
No, it's not
a big operation.

30:46.644 --> 30:48.978
They've got maybe one guard
for the whole property.

30:49.046 --> 30:51.581
If we wait for him to pass,
we just run like hell.

30:51.649 --> 30:53.182
Wait, how do you know?

30:53.250 --> 30:54.784
I watched their patterns.

30:54.852 --> 30:56.786
And when they drove us in,
I only saw one guard.

30:56.854 --> 30:59.322
What are you?

30:59.390 --> 31:02.558
You're some kind of cop.

31:03.761 --> 31:08.231
So you--they know
that you're here.

31:08.298 --> 31:10.099
They might come
and get us.

31:10.200 --> 31:12.602
No.

31:12.670 --> 31:15.038
Nobody knows.

31:16.173 --> 31:18.775
Don't you have a wire?

31:20.344 --> 31:22.245
No, I have nothing.

31:27.017 --> 31:30.520
We've got a special guest
tonight.

31:30.587 --> 31:33.373
Minimum bid just doubled.

32:04.188 --> 32:06.122
How's it gonna go?

32:15.383 --> 32:16.800
Get the money.

32:19.503 --> 32:22.555
This one is mine.

32:27.111 --> 32:28.762
You're sick.

32:28.846 --> 32:30.280
Uhh!

32:30.347 --> 32:31.948
What did you say?

32:32.016 --> 32:33.349
How messed up
do you have to be...

32:33.401 --> 32:37.754
To sit in a cell and pretend
you've got a friend?

32:37.822 --> 32:39.606
They're gonna find you.

32:39.690 --> 32:41.775
Well, you won't be here
to see it.

32:41.859 --> 32:43.126
It doesn't matter.

32:43.194 --> 32:45.528
You're gonna lose.

33:07.685 --> 33:09.219
Look at how brave.

33:13.257 --> 33:16.526
You get off on it,
don't you?

33:17.695 --> 33:19.646
Betraying people.

33:19.730 --> 33:22.499
What, it's a power trip?

33:22.566 --> 33:25.135
You have all the control.

33:25.202 --> 33:27.203
How did you know?

33:27.271 --> 33:30.440
But, you know,
this isn't about me

33:30.508 --> 33:32.342
or you, really.

33:32.409 --> 33:36.112
This is about money.

33:37.832 --> 33:39.115
Ohh!

33:39.166 --> 33:41.151
They're gonna find
all of you, and when they--

33:41.218 --> 33:43.002
- Boss!
- What?

33:44.188 --> 33:45.288
Take care of it.

33:45.339 --> 33:46.956
- We gotta go.
- What about her?

33:47.007 --> 33:48.258
Ohh!

34:25.212 --> 34:27.496
Uhh!

34:37.891 --> 34:41.143
Just give me a excuse
to blow your brains out!

35:13.377 --> 35:14.928
Let me see your hands!

35:15.012 --> 35:16.179
Against the wall.

35:20.851 --> 35:22.602
Clear!

35:38.202 --> 35:39.586
She's alive.

35:39.670 --> 35:41.921
We need a medic
downstairs.

35:50.547 --> 35:51.981
How's she doing?

35:52.049 --> 35:53.800
She's still out,
but her vitals are good.

35:53.884 --> 35:54.934
She's gonna make it.

35:55.019 --> 35:56.386
This is the last one.

35:56.453 --> 35:58.821
- How many arrests?
- 18.

35:58.889 --> 36:00.423
And 7 victims rescued.

36:00.474 --> 36:02.358
Hey! Hey, stop that vehicle!

36:02.426 --> 36:04.277
Stop! Where you going?!

36:04.361 --> 36:05.862
Stop!

36:18.275 --> 36:21.577
They were gonna
take me away.

36:21.645 --> 36:22.962
We need to get you some help.

36:23.047 --> 36:24.580
I'm fine.

36:24.648 --> 36:26.466
I'm fine.

36:28.719 --> 36:30.420
We know what happened here.

36:30.487 --> 36:33.122
No, you don't.

36:33.173 --> 36:36.259
You're right.
I can't imagine.

36:36.327 --> 36:39.479
I just don't want
to get strapped down again.

36:39.563 --> 36:40.930
Strapped down?

36:44.134 --> 36:46.636
He's a lot younger
than I expected.

36:46.704 --> 36:48.004
This guy's our leader?

36:48.072 --> 36:51.574
And how long
have you been gone?

36:51.642 --> 36:55.244
They got me
when I was 17.

36:56.747 --> 36:58.147
Uh-huh.

36:58.215 --> 37:00.033
He was the only one
who got out.

37:00.117 --> 37:03.086
Right.

37:03.153 --> 37:04.754
But...

37:04.822 --> 37:07.156
They go after
older ones now.

37:07.224 --> 37:10.593
And she's the only victim
he took with him.

37:10.661 --> 37:13.096
Why don't I
give you a ride.

37:15.466 --> 37:17.433
You don't have to
come with me.

37:17.501 --> 37:19.068
No, it's ok.

37:19.136 --> 37:21.337
Renee was last seen
with a brunette.

37:21.405 --> 37:23.072
It's her.

37:23.140 --> 37:24.440
Dave!

37:59.009 --> 38:02.278
You ever think of
packing it all in?

38:02.346 --> 38:04.714
Yeah. Sometimes.

38:04.782 --> 38:06.382
We should live on a farm.

38:06.450 --> 38:07.550
What?

38:07.618 --> 38:08.768
Land, fresh air,

38:08.852 --> 38:10.119
chickens.

38:10.187 --> 38:11.521
- Seclusion.
- Yes.

38:11.572 --> 38:13.990
Yeah, that's all a bad guy
needs to torture you.

38:14.057 --> 38:15.491
Ok, stop.

38:15.559 --> 38:17.076
Well, it's true.

38:17.161 --> 38:19.295
But what if you didn't
see that anymore?

38:19.363 --> 38:22.081
What if all you saw
were acres and acres

38:22.166 --> 38:25.668
of--of green and,
oh, a windmill

38:25.736 --> 38:29.238
and solar panels?

38:29.289 --> 38:34.127
You, Kevin Lynch, would
give up all things digital?

38:34.211 --> 38:35.962
All I need is you.

38:37.314 --> 38:40.450
And those sheep with the black
heads and the white bodies.

38:40.517 --> 38:43.436
But no wool.
I'm allergic.

38:43.520 --> 38:45.455
What do you say?

38:45.522 --> 38:47.723
Do you want to buy
the farm with me?

38:49.526 --> 38:51.527
Wouldn't that mean
we're dead?

38:53.030 --> 38:54.096
Excuse me.

38:54.148 --> 38:56.265
I'm serious.
Think about it.

38:56.333 --> 38:57.266
I will.

38:57.317 --> 38:58.367
Good.

38:58.435 --> 39:00.769
Hello, Agent.

39:00.821 --> 39:02.955
Hey, Kevin.

39:03.040 --> 39:04.290
Is he all right?

39:04.374 --> 39:05.541
Yeah.

39:05.609 --> 39:07.009
Are you all right?

39:07.077 --> 39:08.044
Yeah.

39:08.111 --> 39:09.912
Yeah, I'm all right.

39:09.963 --> 39:11.664
Jeez.

39:15.352 --> 39:16.669
What happened to you?

39:16.753 --> 39:19.288
That guy was huge.
Seriously.

39:19.356 --> 39:20.289
You should start
working out.

39:20.357 --> 39:22.158
Oh, you go jokes now?

39:23.894 --> 39:25.261
What is it, kid?

39:25.329 --> 39:28.598
We only rescued
7 victims today.

39:29.733 --> 39:31.601
What about the rest of these?

39:31.668 --> 39:32.835
It never ends.

39:32.903 --> 39:35.505
But today I think we did good.

39:35.572 --> 39:37.073
Yeah, we did.

39:37.140 --> 39:39.609
Yeah, if we weren't
so exhausted I would toast us.

39:39.676 --> 39:41.777
Good work, everybody.

39:41.845 --> 39:43.779
Go home and get some rest.

39:43.847 --> 39:46.982
Nobody needs to come in
till 9:00.

39:49.620 --> 39:51.988
We were supposed to
talk ab--

39:52.055 --> 39:54.156
has he ever left
before us?

39:54.224 --> 39:56.259
Baby girl,
I don't blame him.

39:56.360 --> 39:57.827
It's been a long-ass day.

39:57.895 --> 40:00.096
Well, you heard the man.

40:00.163 --> 40:01.264
Go home.

40:01.331 --> 40:02.715
You don't
have to tell me twice.

40:02.799 --> 40:03.766
Hey, is anyone hungry?

40:03.834 --> 40:04.934
Starving.

40:05.001 --> 40:06.435
There's this super good
Indian restaurant.

40:06.503 --> 40:08.020
It's a little ways away,
but it's open 24 hours

40:08.105 --> 40:10.540
and they have amazing
chicken tandoori.

40:10.607 --> 40:12.008
All right.

40:21.351 --> 40:23.986
"What it lies
in our power to do,

40:24.037 --> 40:27.156
it lies in our power
not to do."

40:27.207 --> 40:28.491
Aristotle.

40:40.036 --> 40:42.405
You said
we needed to talk,

40:42.472 --> 40:44.874
but at 2 a.m.?

40:44.942 --> 40:48.311
I saw the lights were on.

40:48.378 --> 40:50.980
And you couldn't sleep.

40:51.048 --> 40:52.815
Which tells me

40:52.883 --> 40:55.618
you've given some thought
to what we discussed.

40:55.686 --> 40:59.455
I haven't stopped
thinking about it.

41:00.824 --> 41:02.792
So?

41:03.827 --> 41:06.128
I'm coming back.
