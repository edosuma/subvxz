00:35.314 --> 00:38.107
- Yes, I'm still on hold.
- And what was this?

00:38.316 --> 00:42.319
I'm looking at your advertisement
for the airline giveaway.

00:42.486 --> 00:44.028
Our frequent flyer plan.

00:44.238 --> 00:47.657
It's hard to understand
because it says, "In addition to"...

00:47.866 --> 00:53.204
...but I can't understand in addition
to what? There's nothing to add it to.

00:53.664 --> 00:55.414
I think that's a typo, then.

00:55.665 --> 00:58.417
Okay, so just to clarify, I'm sorry...

00:58.626 --> 01:02.462
...10 purchases of Healthy Choice
products equals 500 miles.

01:02.672 --> 01:06.341
And with the coupon, the same
purchases value 1000 miles?

01:06.551 --> 01:07.592
That's it.

01:07.801 --> 01:11.220
Do you realize that
the monetary value of this prize...

01:11.429 --> 01:15.390
...is potentially worth more
than the purchases?

01:16.726 --> 01:18.852
I don't know.

01:23.232 --> 01:27.193
Could I call you back? Could I ask
you your extension and name?

01:27.444 --> 01:30.613
It's extension 215,
and the name is Carter.

01:30.822 --> 01:33.699
Carter. Thank you very much, Carter.

01:33.909 --> 01:36.535
- All right.
- Bye-bye.

03:10.955 --> 03:13.956
- I'm not sure what that means.
- If they break, is it plastic?

03:14.124 --> 03:15.833
It's plastic, yeah.

03:16.042 --> 03:21.129
But that kind of breakage shouldn't be
a problem in the shipping room.

03:21.338 --> 03:23.715
I'm gonna run the numbers.
I'll give you a call.

03:23.882 --> 03:27.468
- You have my home phone number?
- What's that for?

03:27.761 --> 03:29.762
If you wanted to call me.

03:30.013 --> 03:32.056
I'm fine.
I have your work number.

03:32.265 --> 03:37.019
Because of the time difference,
if you needed to reach me earlier--

03:37.228 --> 03:40.272
No, it's fine. I can just
get you at your office.

03:40.440 --> 03:41.440
- Okay.
- Okay.

03:41.607 --> 03:42.607
- All right.
- Bye-bye.

03:42.775 --> 03:44.025
Bye-bye.

04:32.611 --> 04:36.864
- Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?
- No.

04:37.074 --> 04:40.409
- They're not open yet.
- They don't get open until 8:00.

04:40.619 --> 04:43.162
Is it okay if I leave
my car, you think?

04:43.330 --> 04:45.497
I don't know. I don't know.

04:45.707 --> 04:48.584
I thought they opened at 7.

04:49.961 --> 04:52.296
If I left my car, would it be okay?

04:52.462 --> 04:54.880
See, I don't know how they do it.

04:55.132 --> 04:57.883
- Do you know them?
- Not very well.

04:58.134 --> 05:00.594
Could I trust to leave
my key with you...

05:00.762 --> 05:03.847
...so when they get here,
you could give it to them?

05:04.015 --> 05:06.766
Okay, sure.

05:13.148 --> 05:17.902
- You think it's okay where I've left it?
- It'll be fine. I can watch it.

05:18.195 --> 05:21.113
- Thanks a lot.
- I'll keep an eye on it.

05:23.366 --> 05:27.744
- There's a piano in the street.
- Yeah.

05:28.829 --> 05:32.122
Maybe I'll see you later.
Thank you for your help.

05:32.290 --> 05:33.415
Thank you.

05:33.583 --> 05:37.753
- Maybe I'll see you later.
- Okay.

09:04.233 --> 09:06.275
Morning, Barry.

09:07.486 --> 09:09.487
- You okay?
- Yes.

09:09.737 --> 09:12.905
- Why are you wearing a suit?
- I bought one.

09:13.073 --> 09:18.869
I thought it'd be nice to get dressed
for work, and I'm not sure why.

09:20.288 --> 09:24.416
- May I please show you something?
- Sure.

09:27.920 --> 09:29.921
What's this?

09:34.802 --> 09:37.387
I believe this is a small piano.

09:37.596 --> 09:40.056
It's not a piano.
I got a piano at home.

09:40.265 --> 09:42.350
Where did you get it?

09:42.516 --> 09:46.186
It was dropped in the street.

09:47.188 --> 09:49.439
Why is it here?

09:50.983 --> 09:52.358
Barry?

09:54.903 --> 09:56.237
Barry?

09:56.404 --> 09:58.072
Morning, Barry.

09:58.657 --> 10:00.240
I don't know.

10:38.234 --> 10:39.985
Great product.

10:40.194 --> 10:43.613
I have to make sure I don't end
up with extra inventory.

10:43.823 --> 10:46.700
Can you guarantee all your sales?

10:46.866 --> 10:52.204
We back our funders 100%. We ask
for a 30-60 day display on the floor.

10:52.455 --> 10:56.624
Barry, your sister's on line one.
Barry, your sister's on line one.

10:56.792 --> 11:00.503
I don't think they'll be out
that long. I guarantee that.

11:00.713 --> 11:03.631
Let me just get this, this is my sister.

11:04.424 --> 11:06.175
It's not a problem.

11:06.343 --> 11:08.052
- This is Barry.
- It's Rhonda.

11:08.220 --> 11:10.930
- Are you going to this party tonight?
- Yes, I am.

11:11.097 --> 11:15.434
- All right, fine. Bye.
- Bye-bye. I'll see you tonight.

11:15.894 --> 11:18.020
Sorry about that.

11:18.562 --> 11:23.899
We've received a large order from the
Rio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.

11:24.109 --> 11:28.195
We will be supplying their bathrooms
with the dice and money funder.

11:28.404 --> 11:31.156
So these babies are really flying.

11:31.324 --> 11:35.201
Barry, your sister's on line two.
Barry, your sister's on line two.

11:35.369 --> 11:38.913
With the aquablast, little zippers,
whales and speedboats...

11:39.123 --> 11:41.541
...we ask the display be at eye level.

11:41.708 --> 11:44.752
- Barry.
- Let me just get that.

11:44.961 --> 11:48.464
You know, you can also
color-coordinate these funders.

11:48.590 --> 11:50.591
- This is Barry.
- What are you doing?

11:50.799 --> 11:53.134
I have customers. I can't chat now.

11:53.343 --> 11:55.886
Chat? Did you just say "chat"?

11:56.346 --> 12:00.057
- Yeah, I can't talk--
- You just fucking said "chat."

12:00.266 --> 12:02.559
What are you now? Chat.

12:02.727 --> 12:06.104
I'm calling to make sure you
show up at this party.

12:06.230 --> 12:07.814
- I'll be there.
- Okay, fine.

12:07.982 --> 12:12.819
Then go back to chatting with your
customers, you phony, chatty shit.

12:12.945 --> 12:14.612
All right, thank you.

12:15.531 --> 12:16.781
Sorry about that.

12:16.949 --> 12:18.950
- I didn't know you had a sister.
- I do.

12:19.201 --> 12:22.077
I wanted to tell you
about the new funders.

12:22.453 --> 12:26.956
We've been working on this, and we
have a nonbreakable handle, finally.

12:27.124 --> 12:29.834
Let me demonstrate for you.

12:30.460 --> 12:35.422
Okay, this was one of the old ones.
Do we have a new one around, Lance?

12:35.548 --> 12:39.301
Sorry about that.
That's a little embarrassing.

12:39.469 --> 12:41.636
Barry, your sister's on line four.

12:41.804 --> 12:45.265
- So how many sisters do you have?
- I have seven.

12:45.474 --> 12:47.142
Yes.

12:47.309 --> 12:51.187
They're calling me because
they're having a party tonight.

12:51.355 --> 12:54.106
I'll be two more minutes, okay?

12:58.903 --> 13:00.570
- This is Barry.
- What are you doing?

13:00.738 --> 13:01.946
Kathleen. I'm working.

13:02.114 --> 13:03.781
- You going to the party?
- Yes.

13:03.991 --> 13:05.992
- What are you doing?
- I'm working.

13:06.201 --> 13:08.828
Yeah, but what are you doing?

13:09.037 --> 13:11.413
I'm talking on the phone, standing.

13:11.539 --> 13:13.624
- What time you gonna be there?
- 7.

13:13.833 --> 13:16.460
- You can't be late. I'm serious.
- I won't.

13:16.669 --> 13:20.964
You can't not show up like you do.
You have to go. Seriously.

13:21.215 --> 13:24.509
- You can't just stay in your house.
- All right.

13:24.718 --> 13:30.014
- I'll see you there? Don't puss out.
- See you there. Okay.

14:09.175 --> 14:12.135
Is her car going to be okay?

14:12.303 --> 14:14.762
- It's fine.
- Thanks.

14:17.266 --> 14:19.225
Barry, it's your sister.

14:20.727 --> 14:23.187
- Hi. How are you?
- Hey, Elizabeth.

14:23.355 --> 14:24.772
- How's it going?
- Great.

14:24.939 --> 14:27.024
- Stopped by to say hello.
- Terrific.

14:27.192 --> 14:29.192
- So you're going tonight?
- Yes.

14:29.359 --> 14:30.693
- Cool.
- You're going?

14:30.902 --> 14:34.905
Yes. I came by to talk to you
about something in particular.

14:35.115 --> 14:39.993
There's this friend of mine who's
really cute, and I want you to meet her.

14:40.161 --> 14:43.955
I was thinking about bringing
her tonight. What do you think?

14:44.123 --> 14:47.750
Yeah, I don't wanna do that.

14:47.918 --> 14:51.129
- Why?
- I just don't do stuff like that.

14:51.255 --> 14:53.756
Well, you don't really do anything.

14:53.924 --> 14:56.300
Everybody would be looking at me.

14:56.510 --> 14:59.220
What's wrong with looking?
It's a free country.

14:59.387 --> 15:04.766
I just feel like I'd be a little tense,
and I don't think I'd act like myself.

15:04.933 --> 15:08.352
Well, that's kind of your fault.

15:11.314 --> 15:14.858
There's an outside chance
I'm not even coming tonight.

15:16.235 --> 15:19.905
Really? Didn't you tell everybody
you were coming?

15:20.072 --> 15:23.575
I have to renew
my gym membership.

15:23.742 --> 15:27.453
Right. God, well, that
solves everything, actually.

15:27.663 --> 15:31.290
If you're not coming, then I can
bring her. It's not a big deal.

15:31.500 --> 15:34.919
Well, it'll be fine. Great.

15:36.128 --> 15:39.130
- Please don't--
- I'm just trying to be your friend.

15:39.339 --> 15:41.632
I hope you can make it.

15:44.970 --> 15:48.222
Remember when Barry
used to get all mad?

15:48.390 --> 15:51.850
Because Rhonda used
to call him "Gay Boy" all the time.

15:52.685 --> 15:55.562
- That's right.
- Remember the sliding glass door?

15:55.730 --> 15:58.273
He threw that hammer
through the door.

15:58.482 --> 16:01.484
He got glass in his foot.
Mom took him to the hospital.

16:01.652 --> 16:06.280
He came home and locked himself
in the bathroom with the hammer.

16:07.907 --> 16:09.783
- Hey, there he is.
- Hi.

16:10.951 --> 16:15.329
We were talking about you. Remember
when we used to call you Gay Boy?

16:15.539 --> 16:17.540
- What?
- We called you Gay Boy.

16:17.749 --> 16:20.876
We'd call you Gay Boy,
and you'd just freak out.

16:21.002 --> 16:24.797
You got so mad, you threw
the hammer through the glass door.

16:24.923 --> 16:26.381
- You remember.
- I don't.

16:26.549 --> 16:30.177
Yes, you do. We were calling you
Gay Boy, and you got mad.

16:30.345 --> 16:32.387
Are you gay now?

16:32.555 --> 16:34.180
I don't know.

16:34.390 --> 16:37.058
We were trying to figure out
why you had a hammer.

16:37.226 --> 16:40.353
- Why are you wearing that suit?
- I don't know.

16:40.520 --> 16:42.020
- I like his suit.
- Thank you.

16:42.188 --> 16:45.023
- Are you using that dandruff shampoo?
- Yes.

16:45.191 --> 16:46.274
- You are?
- Barry?

16:46.400 --> 16:50.236
- Why did you have the hammer?
- Why did I have the hammer?

16:50.362 --> 16:54.198
- He was building a doghouse.
- Okay, Rhonda.

16:54.324 --> 16:57.159
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks for coming.

16:57.369 --> 17:00.371
- A cake. We have a cake.
- You got a cake.

17:00.538 --> 17:04.415
Hey, I was just thinking about you.
Glad you could make it.

17:04.584 --> 17:08.837
- Mr. Chatty. Hi, Mr. Chatty.
- You have rice in your hair.

17:08.963 --> 17:11.256
Say hello to your
brother-in-laws.

17:11.423 --> 17:14.424
- Hey, Barry, how you doing?
- How you doing, pal?

17:14.634 --> 17:17.176
- Good to see you.
- Saw your car. Snazzy.

17:17.345 --> 17:20.847
- Hey, Barry, how you doing?
- I'm sorry!

17:21.015 --> 17:22.515
- How you doing?
- How is it going?

17:22.724 --> 17:24.184
How's work?

17:24.393 --> 17:28.354
- Business is very food, thank you.
- What's very food?

17:28.564 --> 17:31.774
- What's that?
- You just said "very food."

17:31.984 --> 17:35.194
I'm sorry, I meant to say
"very good."

17:35.403 --> 17:38.405
Maybe you said "food"
because you're hungry.

17:38.615 --> 17:41.950
- You know, you want to eat.
- That makes sense.

17:45.370 --> 17:48.205
Is your friend here?

17:48.373 --> 17:51.250
No. You're off the hook.
She couldn't make it.

17:51.417 --> 17:53.502
Thank you.

17:54.295 --> 17:55.879
- You nervous?
- No.

17:56.047 --> 17:58.965
- You look nervous.
- I feel very happy.

17:59.133 --> 18:02.302
Good. Did you get
your gym membership?

18:02.469 --> 18:04.095
Tomorrow.

18:05.556 --> 18:10.017
I had a girl I was gonna bring
for Barry. He wouldn't let me do it.

18:10.185 --> 18:14.355
I had this girl to bring for him.
She's awesome. We work together.

18:14.521 --> 18:18.190
- He said he couldn't be himself.
- Gay Boy, it's time to eat.

18:18.358 --> 18:20.484
- Who's he going to be?
- I don't know.

18:20.694 --> 18:23.404
He's worried we'll give him
a bunch of shit.

18:23.571 --> 18:26.323
He said he wouldn't come
if I brought her.

18:26.533 --> 18:29.242
He's an asshole.
Why do you listen to him?

18:29.410 --> 18:34.164
I don't know. I was gonna bring her.
It would've been totally casual.

18:34.373 --> 18:36.374
Look at him.

18:40.421 --> 18:45.883
- What the fuck is your problem?
- You fucking retard, Barry!

18:50.846 --> 18:55.683
I'm sorry about that.
Sorry about what I did.

18:55.892 --> 18:57.101
It's all right.

18:58.436 --> 19:02.314
I wanted to ask you something
because you're a doctor, right?

19:03.358 --> 19:04.733
Yeah.

19:06.152 --> 19:11.114
I don't like myself sometimes.

19:13.993 --> 19:16.703
Can you help me?

19:18.496 --> 19:23.041
Barry, I'm a dentist. What kind
of help do you think I can give you?

19:23.250 --> 19:26.836
I know. Maybe you know
other doctors?

19:27.004 --> 19:28.296
Like a psychiatrist?

19:28.464 --> 19:32.299
I just don't have anybody else
I can talk to about things...

19:32.426 --> 19:36.178
...and I understand
it's confidential with a doctor.

19:36.346 --> 19:39.973
And I just-- I don't want
my sisters to know, okay?

19:40.183 --> 19:42.726
Because I'm embarrassed about this.

19:42.894 --> 19:46.605
If it's about getting you
a phone number for a psychiatrist...

19:46.814 --> 19:49.774
...I can do that. It's not a problem.

19:49.942 --> 19:53.945
But what exactly is wrong?

19:54.112 --> 19:56.780
I don't know
if there is anything wrong...

19:56.906 --> 20:00.158
...because I don't
know how other people are.

20:00.868 --> 20:06.289
I sometimes cry a lot...

20:06.707 --> 20:09.667
...for no reason.

20:21.304 --> 20:23.430
I'm sorry.

21:06.135 --> 21:08.929
$1.79.

21:35.787 --> 21:39.790
What am I looking for?
What am I looking for?

21:39.958 --> 21:42.125
Tell me. Talk to me.

21:42.251 --> 21:45.795
Talk to me. Talk to me.

21:48.132 --> 21:49.924
Pudding.

22:17.033 --> 22:19.951
I see you, Richard Seelan, yes.

22:20.119 --> 22:22.787
All right, Mr. Seelan.

22:32.213 --> 22:34.381
Hi, this is Janice. Who's this?

22:34.590 --> 22:35.840
Hi. How you doing?

22:36.008 --> 22:39.052
- Hi. Is this your first time calling?
- Yes, it is.

22:39.219 --> 22:42.513
Can I have your credit card number
and expiration date?

22:42.681 --> 22:45.808
Sure. How much is this, anyways?

22:45.976 --> 22:50.979
It's $2.99 per minute for the first
half-hour, $1.99 per minute after that.

22:51.147 --> 22:54.483
- Okay, and it's confidential?
- What do you mean?

22:54.692 --> 22:57.944
The information I give you
is private, confidential?

22:58.154 --> 23:01.281
Of course, yeah.
Would you like to talk to a girl?

23:01.407 --> 23:05.284
I can connect you with a girl if I can
have your credit card number...

23:05.451 --> 23:07.953
...followed by the expiration date.

23:08.162 --> 23:12.373
Sure. 5-1-0-2...

23:13.459 --> 23:16.586
...1-7-1-7...

23:17.880 --> 23:20.298
...8-1-1-8...

23:20.465 --> 23:22.466
...6-5-5-4.

23:22.676 --> 23:25.219
Expiration, 05-04.

23:25.720 --> 23:28.680
Your billing address
and the name on the card.

23:28.848 --> 23:34.603
1274 Moorpark,
Sherman Oaks, California...

23:34.769 --> 23:40.107
...Apartment 4. 91403, ZIP code.

23:40.483 --> 23:42.984
- And your name?
- Barry Egan.

23:43.402 --> 23:45.695
And your social security number.

23:45.863 --> 23:47.614
What for?

23:47.823 --> 23:51.784
It's just for verification through
the credit card company.

23:52.453 --> 23:54.453
And this is confidential?

23:54.663 --> 23:58.624
It's to verify your credit information.
It's confidential.

23:58.834 --> 24:01.877
It appears on your credit card
as D&D Mattress Man.

24:02.045 --> 24:04.129
Very good.

24:04.380 --> 24:06.757
9-1--

24:06.882 --> 24:10.301
- I'm sorry, 9-1-7...
- It's okay.

24:10.468 --> 24:12.845
...6-5...

24:13.888 --> 24:16.139
...5-0-1-2.

24:16.307 --> 24:21.061
- Okay, so hang on, Barry, all right?
- Thank you very much.

24:26.650 --> 24:27.692
We're all set.

24:27.860 --> 24:31.654
Can I have the number
where we can call you back?

24:31.822 --> 24:35.616
Could you possibly just connect me
to one of the girls?

24:35.784 --> 24:39.745
Well, it's a callback service.
A girl will call you back.

24:39.953 --> 24:43.497
I just was calling to speak
with one of the girls.

24:43.665 --> 24:46.083
I thought that's how it worked.
I'm 8-1-8...

24:46.835 --> 24:49.586
...7-7-5...

24:50.547 --> 24:52.673
...3-9-9-3.

24:52.799 --> 24:55.592
What kind of a girl
would you like to talk to?

24:55.760 --> 25:00.013
I don't want anybody to know it's me.
I don't want them to know my name.

25:00.181 --> 25:03.808
- Nobody will know your name.
- Tell them my name's Jack.

25:03.976 --> 25:08.145
- You want her to call you Jack?
- I don't want her to know it's me.

25:08.272 --> 25:10.356
- Okay, Jack.
- Thank you. I'm sorry.

25:10.524 --> 25:13.192
- No problem. We'll call you right back.
- Terrific.

25:13.359 --> 25:14.901
Okay.

25:44.929 --> 25:47.097
Hello, this is Back.

25:47.264 --> 25:50.016
I'm calling for Jack.

25:50.184 --> 25:52.977
- How you doing?
- Hi. How are you doing?

25:53.187 --> 25:55.146
- This is Jack.
- This is Georgia.

25:55.314 --> 25:58.649
- Hi.
- Hi. What are you doing tonight?

25:58.817 --> 26:01.026
Nothing. What are you doing?

26:01.194 --> 26:04.488
I am laying on my bed.

26:04.656 --> 26:07.407
- Where are you?
- I'm in my bedroom.

26:07.992 --> 26:11.745
- No, I mean what state, what city?
- I'm in California.

26:11.912 --> 26:15.498
- Me too. I'm in California.
- I know you are. I'm in Los Angeles.

26:15.665 --> 26:17.124
I'm in Los Angeles too.

26:17.333 --> 26:21.670
Well, maybe we should hook up
sometime. What do you think?

26:22.254 --> 26:26.382
- Are you watching a porno movie?
- No, I'm not, Georgia.

26:26.550 --> 26:30.428
- Do you like porno movies?
- Sure.

26:31.180 --> 26:34.557
So Jack, are you stroking it?

26:35.225 --> 26:36.600
No.

26:36.768 --> 26:39.770
- What are you doing, then?
- I'm talking to you.

26:40.438 --> 26:42.564
With your pants off?

26:42.732 --> 26:45.484
No, my pants are on.

26:45.693 --> 26:49.529
I'm only wearing a T-shirt
and panties.

26:49.696 --> 26:52.364
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

26:52.532 --> 26:56.159
And I'm looking at my shaved pussy
in the mirror.

26:56.327 --> 26:59.204
- Want to know what I look like?
- Doesn't matter.

26:59.372 --> 27:01.372
What do you mean,
it doesn't matter?

27:01.540 --> 27:04.751
I have no way of finding out,
so it doesn't matter.

27:04.960 --> 27:11.006
I'm not lying to you, Jack.
I'm about 5 foot 8, 34-28-34.

27:11.216 --> 27:13.259
- My friends say I'm gorgeous.
- Really?

27:13.426 --> 27:16.970
- Yeah, really. What about you?
- That doesn't matter.

27:17.138 --> 27:19.848
Yes, it does.

27:21.058 --> 27:24.268
- You're married, aren't you?
- No.

27:24.436 --> 27:27.688
- No? You have a girlfriend?
- Yes.

27:27.856 --> 27:33.652
- Where is she?
- She went out of town.

27:33.778 --> 27:35.820
Good, I like that.

27:35.988 --> 27:39.699
- I'm so horny, Jack. What about you?
- Sure.

27:40.617 --> 27:44.370
- Do you like peaches, Jack?
- They're okay.

27:44.496 --> 27:48.833
Well, you'll like them even better
because I'm a Georgia peach.

27:49.292 --> 27:53.128
- Are you jacking off yet, Jack?
- No, I'm not.

27:53.295 --> 27:56.922
Well, do you ever?

27:57.132 --> 28:00.134
Sometimes, yeah, when I'm lonely.

28:00.302 --> 28:03.345
You don't have to be lonely,
because you got me now.

28:03.555 --> 28:08.350
You sound very nice
and very personable.

28:08.559 --> 28:10.810
Personable. Thank you, baby.

28:10.978 --> 28:13.188
So, what do you do, Barry?

28:13.397 --> 28:18.651
I work. I have my own business.
I work hard at doing my business.

28:18.819 --> 28:21.195
- Are you good at your business?
- Yes.

28:21.363 --> 28:26.075
Yeah? So do you do really well?
Do you make tons of money?

28:27.409 --> 28:30.077
I'm doing pretty good,
I think, as a start.

28:30.245 --> 28:35.124
I wish I was making more, doing better,
but I can't get over a certain hump.

28:35.292 --> 28:40.170
I will. I'll crack something very soon,
I think, and really do better.

28:40.296 --> 28:44.966
I'd like to diversify,
but I'm doing great, I think, as a start.

28:45.801 --> 28:48.887
Are you stroking it yet, baby?

28:49.430 --> 28:52.223
- No, I'm not.
- Is your cock hard?

28:52.433 --> 28:54.809
I don't know what
it's doing right now.

28:54.977 --> 28:58.979
Why don't you take
your clothes off, Jack.

28:59.271 --> 29:04.484
And I want to picture you laying
down with me next to you...

29:04.610 --> 29:08.487
...and I want you to stroke
your cock, okay?

29:12.951 --> 29:16.829
I'm so horny, Barry. I want you.

29:38.057 --> 29:41.517
- This is Barry.
- What are you doing? How are you?

29:41.685 --> 29:45.438
- I'm fine. Nothing. How are you?
- It's me. It's Georgia.

29:47.149 --> 29:50.276
- How's it going?
- It's okay that I'm calling, right?

29:50.443 --> 29:51.860
Sure.

29:52.028 --> 29:55.572
I just wanted to call
and thank you for last night...

29:55.782 --> 29:58.575
...and just catch you before you
went to work and say hey.

29:58.743 --> 30:00.952
Well, thank you.

30:01.119 --> 30:04.913
I am so tired. I went to bed
so late last night.

30:05.081 --> 30:08.583
- When did you go to sleep?
- Not very late.

30:08.751 --> 30:12.045
- Well, you going to work now?
- Yes.

30:12.213 --> 30:15.048
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

30:15.216 --> 30:19.635
Remember last night I was telling
you about my apartment and my rent?

30:19.761 --> 30:21.137
Remember?

30:21.888 --> 30:25.015
This is so weird and really
embarrassing for me...

30:25.183 --> 30:30.229
...but I was wondering if you'd
help me out with some money.

30:30.438 --> 30:33.273
- Me?
- Yeah.

30:33.940 --> 30:37.234
Yeah, no, I'm sorry.
I can't afford that.

30:37.402 --> 30:39.903
But you don't even know
how much it is.

30:40.071 --> 30:44.324
- How much is it?
- Like 750. Seven hundred and fifty.

30:44.492 --> 30:48.286
Yeah, no, I can't
afford that. I'm sorry.

30:48.496 --> 30:52.999
- Seriously?
- You're having financial trouble?

30:53.167 --> 30:57.587
It's so hard these days,
and, yeah, I really need it.

30:57.796 --> 31:02.258
Yeah, I just don't have enough
money to be able to do that. I'm sorry.

31:02.425 --> 31:04.760
I thought you had your own business.

31:04.927 --> 31:08.387
You said you were gonna
diversify and all that stuff.

31:08.597 --> 31:10.806
So you think you can?

31:11.850 --> 31:13.976
I'm sorry.

31:14.144 --> 31:17.062
Maybe I should call back
and talk to your girlfriend?

31:17.230 --> 31:20.440
Maybe it'd be better
to ask her for the money.

31:20.733 --> 31:24.319
It could be really easy, Barry.
I have all your information.

31:24.528 --> 31:29.115
- Your credit card, your billing stuff--
- Okay. No, thank you.

31:33.537 --> 31:35.371
- Morning, Barry.
- Morning, Lance.

31:35.580 --> 31:37.123
What's with all this pudding?

31:37.331 --> 31:41.250
That's part of a pretty amazing
airline promotional giveaway.

31:41.418 --> 31:45.629
I'm gonna collect puddings
and coupons that can be redeemed...

31:45.756 --> 31:47.548
...for frequent flyer miles.

31:47.674 --> 31:49.925
- You going on a trip?
- No, I'm not...

31:50.093 --> 31:52.845
...but airline mileage is like
a currency these days.

31:53.012 --> 31:55.263
- You should go on a trip.
- No, thank you.

31:55.431 --> 31:57.307
What do you want me to do with it?

31:57.475 --> 32:00.685
Why don't we just leave it
there for now.

33:07.455 --> 33:11.041
Thank you very much. I'm well.
My name is Barry Egan.

33:11.209 --> 33:16.296
I have a little problem
with my MasterCard.

33:17.755 --> 33:21.258
I lost it and I found it again...

33:21.384 --> 33:25.220
...and I'm afraid
in my losting and finding, I...

33:25.346 --> 33:27.388
Somebody might have
used my card--

33:27.556 --> 33:32.476
- And what's the account number?
- I did punch that in earlier. I'm sorry.

33:32.644 --> 33:34.645
I'm just nervous about this.

33:34.813 --> 33:37.982
I don't know the proper
etiquette in this situation.

33:38.149 --> 33:41.276
I just wanna make sure
no one spent any money.

33:41.486 --> 33:44.488
- I don't have money to burn.
- There's nothing--

33:44.655 --> 33:48.073
- I'm clean for now?
- Yes, everything is fine.

33:48.283 --> 33:51.201
- I'm sorry I sound panicked.
- That's okay--

33:51.411 --> 33:52.870
- What's your name?
- Jeanette.

33:53.037 --> 33:54.037
Nice to meet you.

33:54.205 --> 33:56.790
- Okay, so I'll cut it up.
- That's fine.

33:56.999 --> 34:01.086
I'll cut up my card,
then get a new one going, right?

34:01.253 --> 34:02.587
- Yes, you will.
- Thanks.

34:02.755 --> 34:03.755
You're welcome.

34:21.772 --> 34:24.523
Why's that there?
I don't want to be a dick...

34:24.690 --> 34:27.943
...but that could hurt somebody.
It already hurt me.

34:28.110 --> 34:30.320
Let's please move that.

34:36.327 --> 34:39.621
He's wearing that damn suit again.
I don't know why.

34:39.830 --> 34:43.041
- He doesn't usually dress like that.
- That's fine.

34:46.585 --> 34:49.045
Hey, why are you wearing
that suit again?

34:49.213 --> 34:50.505
- I don't know.
- Hi.

34:50.672 --> 34:51.672
- Hi.
- Remember me?

34:51.882 --> 34:53.591
- I left my car yesterday.
- Yes.

34:53.759 --> 34:57.345
This is Lena from work.
We're here to pick up her car.

34:57.554 --> 35:00.890
We're getting breakfast.
So do you wanna go eat?

35:01.016 --> 35:02.599
Yeah, I can't.

35:03.184 --> 35:05.144
- Why?
- I have to stay here.

35:05.395 --> 35:07.938
- Seriously, we're going to eat.
- I'm sorry.

35:08.106 --> 35:10.148
- That's all right.
- What is that?

35:10.316 --> 35:13.735
- Are you learning to play the piano?
- That's not a piano.

35:13.986 --> 35:17.030
Lance! Remember we have
to call that guy in Toledo.

35:17.239 --> 35:19.240
- Which guy?
- I'll tell you later.

35:19.450 --> 35:23.661
- You don't want to eat with us?
- Telephone, Barry, on line two.

35:23.828 --> 35:25.995
What's all that pudding?

35:26.539 --> 35:29.332
I don't know.
I'll talk to you in a second.

35:29.541 --> 35:32.376
- Let me get this.
- What's that pudding, Barry?

35:32.586 --> 35:33.544
This is Barry.

35:33.754 --> 35:36.130
Hey, baby. I guess
we got disconnected.

35:36.298 --> 35:40.217
We got disconnect-- How did
you get this number for my work?

35:40.427 --> 35:44.888
You canceled your credit card.
I need you not to and up your limit.

35:45.056 --> 35:47.933
Okay, this is making
me very uncomfortable.

35:48.100 --> 35:53.062
I need help. Maybe I should just
call back and talk to your girlfriend.

35:53.313 --> 35:55.689
- I don't have one.
- You said you did.

35:55.898 --> 35:58.358
- I know, but I don't.
- You lied to me?

35:58.526 --> 36:00.735
This is illegal, okay? I'm sorry.

36:00.945 --> 36:03.571
- I'll call the police.
- No, you won't.

36:04.657 --> 36:06.407
This is embarrassing.
Sorry.

36:06.575 --> 36:09.076
- I'll go pay for my car.
- Are you sure?

36:09.244 --> 36:10.286
He's being weird.

36:10.412 --> 36:14.206
- I don't know why he's in that suit.
- It's not bad. It's okay.

36:14.374 --> 36:17.376
He's strange. I don't know
if you'd want to date him.

36:17.585 --> 36:22.047
- It's okay. I'll just pay for my car.
- I'm sorry.

36:30.179 --> 36:32.514
- Come on, rich boy.
- This isn't cool.

36:32.682 --> 36:34.724
- It was last night.
- I'm hanging up.

36:34.934 --> 36:37.602
- You don't know what could happen.
- I have to go.

36:37.770 --> 36:38.728
This is a big mis--

36:38.938 --> 36:42.398
- She's cool, right?
- Why did you just come by like this?

36:42.566 --> 36:46.027
- It's not cool?
- No, it's fine. I feel put on the spot.

36:46.236 --> 36:49.780
- Think you'll ask her out?
- I don't do things like that.

36:49.990 --> 36:53.951
- Why are you being scared?
- I'm not being scared.

36:54.160 --> 36:58.205
- You'll rag on me if I do this.
- Why would I do this to rag you?

36:58.413 --> 37:00.664
- I don't know.
- Can I ask you a question?

37:00.916 --> 37:03.250
Did you ask Walter
to get you a shrink?

37:05.587 --> 37:08.005
Did you ask Walter
to get you a shrink?

37:08.172 --> 37:11.258
What's the matter with you?
Are you okay?

37:11.425 --> 37:13.760
He is lying.

37:14.845 --> 37:17.722
You're being weird again.
Please don't be weird.

37:17.890 --> 37:19.390
We should be going.

37:20.476 --> 37:23.936
Yep. Nope. I have
to get something from my car.

37:24.104 --> 37:26.605
What guy in Toledo
are you talking about?

37:26.815 --> 37:28.649
I'm talking about the guy.

37:28.857 --> 37:32.735
- I'll come over and tell you.
- Is this about the Ramada Inn?

37:33.111 --> 37:35.905
I'll just come over
to you in a second.

37:41.703 --> 37:45.038
I'm sorry I couldn't come
to your sister's party.

37:45.206 --> 37:46.540
I couldn't make it.

37:46.833 --> 37:49.918
Not a problem. Don't worry.
We had a terrific time.

37:50.252 --> 37:52.420
Must be weird
to have so many sisters.

37:52.630 --> 37:55.923
- Not at all. It's nice.
- Telephone, Barry, line one.

37:56.133 --> 37:58.092
Pardon.

37:58.802 --> 38:01.762
- This is Barry.
- Hang up and there'll be trouble.

38:01.971 --> 38:04.264
- Thank you.
- What do you mean, thank--?

38:04.431 --> 38:07.141
- Business is good. You're busy.
- Not really.

38:07.309 --> 38:09.769
- I saw a picture of you.
- Oh, yes?

38:10.228 --> 38:13.314
Elizabeth has a picture
of your sisters and you.

38:13.440 --> 38:15.441
It's a lot of family. Must be nice.

38:15.650 --> 38:19.152
- Do you have brothers or sisters?
- No. I'm the opposite.

38:20.238 --> 38:22.989
That must be nice.
That must be really...

38:23.115 --> 38:25.825
No, it's terrible.

38:26.827 --> 38:30.163
- What's the pudding for?
- That's something else.

38:30.331 --> 38:34.834
- You going to get pancakes?
- Yes, we are. We're going to--

38:34.959 --> 38:36.751
- God!
- Where you guys going?

38:36.877 --> 38:39.045
How long have you
worked for my sister?

38:39.255 --> 38:41.172
- Six months.
- So you know her.

38:41.340 --> 38:44.300
- Do you wanna check that?
- Sure.

38:44.635 --> 38:47.094
Are you guys hurt?
They're okay.

38:47.262 --> 38:50.514
So, what do you do?
You do what she does? Same job?

38:50.682 --> 38:54.977
I do, but I do mainly field
consultations, which is cool...

38:55.144 --> 38:58.563
...'cause I get to travel.
I'm going to Hawaii on Friday.

38:58.815 --> 39:00.899
Hawaii?
I was thinking about going there.

39:00.983 --> 39:01.566
Really?

39:01.776 --> 39:03.735
Going on business.

39:03.944 --> 39:07.280
- If you're going--
- I probably won't, though.

39:07.447 --> 39:10.323
That's too bad,
because it's so great there...

39:10.491 --> 39:13.618
...and if you were there,
we could say hello.

39:13.786 --> 39:17.080
Yes, but I'm not sure.
I have so much going on here.

39:17.247 --> 39:21.584
It depends on this thing. If it happens,
I won't be able to go.

39:21.710 --> 39:25.629
I can't find that thing in my car.
I can give it to you later.

39:25.797 --> 39:29.633
- So are you gonna come eat with us?
- Yeah, I can't.

39:30.218 --> 39:32.719
Oh, my God!

39:32.887 --> 39:35.305
It was great to meet you again.

39:35.431 --> 39:38.558
- Thanks for helping.
- What's that piano? This pudding?

39:38.725 --> 39:40.934
- I don't know.
- Why are they here?

39:41.102 --> 39:45.897
Call me later about the shrink. And
Walter said you have a crying problem?

39:46.107 --> 39:47.941
Call me later.

39:49.777 --> 39:54.572
He's obviously very busy. I don't even
know if he has time for a girlfriend.

39:54.740 --> 39:56.115
Sorry.

39:56.742 --> 39:59.785
- So I'll just see you at the restaurant?
- Okay.

40:26.936 --> 40:31.105
I'm gonna go and eat tomorrow night.
Do you want to go with me?

40:31.357 --> 40:33.024
Sure.

40:33.275 --> 40:36.610
- Do you want to pick me up?
- Sure.

40:36.820 --> 40:39.238
Can I write down my address
and phone number?

40:39.447 --> 40:41.448
Sure.

40:46.787 --> 40:49.496
- This is funny.
- Yeah.

40:50.540 --> 40:53.167
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

40:55.461 --> 40:58.630
I didn't ask for a shrink.
That was somebody else.

40:58.798 --> 41:00.715
Also, that pudding isn't mine.

41:00.883 --> 41:04.260
I'm wearing a suit because
I had an important meeting.

41:04.428 --> 41:07.972
- And I don't have a crying problem.
- Okay.

41:15.271 --> 41:17.480
- Hi.
- Hi.

41:30.785 --> 41:35.122
- This is Barry.
- You made a fucking war for yourself.

41:43.756 --> 41:46.757
- How do you know he's rich?
- He's gonna diversify.

41:48.134 --> 41:50.009
- Diversify what?
- His business.

41:50.177 --> 41:52.387
- And what is his name?
- Barry Egan.

41:52.596 --> 41:55.014
I can take the brothers
on this mission?

41:55.182 --> 41:59.560
- We'll do it.
- Thank you so much.

42:05.692 --> 42:10.487
Check. Check. One, two. Test. Test.
How's that sound?

42:10.655 --> 42:12.781
You can't do that. It's wrong.

42:14.700 --> 42:15.700
Check.

42:15.868 --> 42:18.536
Check. Check.
One, two. Test.

42:18.745 --> 42:19.995
They'll go.

42:20.204 --> 42:21.455
Great.

42:21.622 --> 42:24.165
- I'm only paying two of you.
- That's cool.

42:24.333 --> 42:28.211
When can you leave? I want you
to go right away. That's best.

42:28.420 --> 42:33.090
I also need you to check out a car
for me there that this guy's selling.

42:34.926 --> 42:37.595
- Your expenses are your own.
- Latisha said you'd pay.

42:37.846 --> 42:40.472
- She was wrong.
- That's not cool.

42:40.682 --> 42:45.227
It doesn't make sense if you
think about it in a fair, deal-like sense.

42:45.395 --> 42:46.520
It's business.

42:46.729 --> 42:50.982
$100, two days' work. It's more than
your family makes sitting around.

42:51.191 --> 42:55.902
All right? Now, I'm serious now,
okay? Please. Now, just stop.

42:56.112 --> 42:58.738
Keys to the truck.
You got to gas that up.

42:58.906 --> 43:02.659
All right, save receipts on that.
His address.

43:03.702 --> 43:06.204
We have his business
address too, but--

43:06.372 --> 43:07.455
You know what?

43:09.708 --> 43:12.084
Hit him at his house first.

43:12.627 --> 43:15.879
See what this little bad-boy
businessman is all about.

43:16.047 --> 43:18.298
Just fix it, sir.

43:18.633 --> 43:22.552
You know, I wanna tell you
something. I've gotta tell you.

43:22.719 --> 43:23.719
Oh, no.

43:23.887 --> 43:26.388
I saw a picture
of your sisters and you...

43:26.598 --> 43:31.518
...and I saw your picture,
and I really wanted to meet you.

43:35.606 --> 43:39.567
I came to drop my car off
on purpose, to try and meet you.

43:43.238 --> 43:45.740
- Are you lying?
- No.

43:45.908 --> 43:48.701
- Oh, my...
- I thought I should tell you.

43:48.910 --> 43:53.414
I didn't want to get too far along on
going out and be hiding something.

43:55.541 --> 43:57.750
Very nice of you to say.

43:58.168 --> 43:59.585
Terrific.

44:02.380 --> 44:04.798
I was listening
to DJs this morning...

44:05.008 --> 44:10.220
...and they always have couples that
call in and talk about their problems.

44:10.471 --> 44:12.430
This DJ Justice--

44:12.640 --> 44:15.809
This morning DJ
that I really like and...

44:16.060 --> 44:18.770
They were talking
about yearbook pictures...

44:18.938 --> 44:22.857
...and how nobody's happy
with the way they look.

44:23.025 --> 44:27.319
I love this guy because he tells it
the way it is. He's not a phony.

44:27.486 --> 44:32.240
And this guy calls up, and
he's talking about his senior quote...

44:32.407 --> 44:35.951
...and DJ Justice says,
"What was great about your quote?"

44:36.161 --> 44:38.621
He says,
"I stole an ancient proverb."

44:38.830 --> 44:43.959
And so he says, "Okay."
And he says, "Confusion say..."

44:44.127 --> 44:47.838
And then DJ Justice says,
"Confusion or Confucius?"

44:48.005 --> 44:52.175
And it was just so comical. DJ
Justice just cuts you down to size.

44:52.343 --> 44:55.678
That's my favorite part of the show.
I laugh and laugh.

44:55.804 --> 44:57.805
Even when I'm alone.

44:58.848 --> 45:04.143
So how's your business going?
Did you sell all that pudding?

45:06.230 --> 45:10.066
That pudding is not a sales item.

45:10.525 --> 45:12.193
Why?

45:14.529 --> 45:17.031
It's not for sale.

45:17.282 --> 45:19.199
Really?

45:19.367 --> 45:21.702
Why is that?

45:23.037 --> 45:25.872
I'd rather not say, if that's okay.

45:25.998 --> 45:29.167
Oh, I'm sorry. What is it,
like, a secret pudding?

45:30.585 --> 45:34.963
Let's just keep it between
you and I, if that's possible?

45:35.131 --> 45:36.881
Sure, sure.

45:40.761 --> 45:45.556
Healthy Choice and American Airlines
got together for this promotion.

45:45.766 --> 45:48.851
If you buy any 10
of Healthy Choice products...

45:49.061 --> 45:51.604
...they'll award you
500 frequent flyer miles.

45:51.855 --> 45:55.816
With this special coupon,
they'll up it to a thousand miles.

45:56.025 --> 46:00.695
So I think they're trying to push their
teriyaki chicken, which is $1.79.

46:00.905 --> 46:04.991
But I looked in the supermarket,
and I saw that they had...

46:05.116 --> 46:07.242
...pudding for 25 cents a cup.

46:07.493 --> 46:09.870
Comes in packages of four.

46:10.246 --> 46:12.205
But insanely...

46:12.415 --> 46:16.376
...the bar codes
are on the individual cups.

46:16.752 --> 46:19.545
So a quarter a cup--

46:19.713 --> 46:21.797
Say you bought $2.50 worth.

46:22.007 --> 46:26.469
That's worth 500 miles.
With the coupon, it's 1000 miles.

46:26.595 --> 46:30.139
It's a marketing mistake,
but I'm taking advantage of it.

46:31.057 --> 46:35.936
If you spent $3000, that would
get you a million frequent flyer miles.

46:36.103 --> 46:39.188
You'd never pay for a ticket
the rest of your life.

46:39.314 --> 46:43.775
So you bought all that pudding so
you could get frequent flyer miles?

46:43.985 --> 46:46.319
That's insane.

46:46.487 --> 46:48.363
I'm guessing it was a mistake.

46:48.573 --> 46:53.159
But I'm taking advantage
of it while it's offered.

46:53.827 --> 46:58.623
Who knows how long it'll last
if too many people start doing it.

46:59.708 --> 47:03.878
Your sister was telling me
a very funny story about you...

47:04.045 --> 47:09.675
...when you guys were kids.
You were building a ramp for the dog...

47:09.883 --> 47:14.428
...and you threw a hammer straight
through a sliding glass door.

47:14.596 --> 47:16.263
Is that right?

47:18.933 --> 47:22.477
Threw a hammer?
I don't remember doing that.

47:24.272 --> 47:27.065
My sister's a liar.

47:28.400 --> 47:31.069
I have to go to the bathroom.

47:47.250 --> 47:50.461
Okay. Sorry.

47:52.797 --> 47:54.381
The waiter come by yet?

47:54.591 --> 47:55.757
- Hello.
- Hi.

47:55.967 --> 47:57.551
Can I talk to you, sir?

47:58.052 --> 47:59.052
Why?

47:59.220 --> 48:01.930
- I need you for a second, please.
- Okay.

48:05.643 --> 48:08.478
- Sir, the bathroom was just torn apart.
- Yeah.

48:08.645 --> 48:10.813
- Did you do it?
- No.

48:11.063 --> 48:13.732
- You didn't smash up the bathroom?
- No.

48:13.899 --> 48:15.859
Well, who did?

48:17.486 --> 48:18.861
I don't know.

48:19.071 --> 48:22.073
- Sir, your hand is bleeding.
- I cut myself.

48:22.324 --> 48:24.784
- How?
- On my knife.

48:26.870 --> 48:28.746
What? What?

48:28.955 --> 48:31.331
- Sir, your hand is bleeding.
- I know.

48:31.458 --> 48:34.209
- You have to leave.
- I didn't do anything.

48:34.377 --> 48:36.545
I can't prove you smashed
the bathroom--

48:36.754 --> 48:38.755
I didn't do that. I didn't.

48:39.006 --> 48:41.007
- I have to ask you to go.
- Okay.

48:41.175 --> 48:43.176
- I didn't do it.
- You have to leave.

48:43.384 --> 48:46.094
- Don't do this.
- Sir, I will call the police.

48:46.262 --> 48:48.263
All right. Can I just stay?

48:48.472 --> 48:52.684
Sir, I'm gonna crack your
fucking head open. Get out of here.

48:54.520 --> 48:55.478
We should go.

48:55.688 --> 48:57.772
- I don't like it here, okay?
- Okay.

48:57.940 --> 48:59.774
Thanks.

49:03.862 --> 49:05.654
Thank you.

50:07.127 --> 50:08.127
Okay.

50:08.295 --> 50:11.214
Hey, you hit it.
You can stop laughing.

50:11.381 --> 50:16.051
So you know that...

50:16.219 --> 50:19.722
...the harmonium that's ended
up in your office?

50:24.726 --> 50:26.435
A harmonium?

50:28.063 --> 50:29.104
The piano.

50:33.234 --> 50:35.819
Did you steal that from the street?

50:37.613 --> 50:38.822
What's this?

50:40.991 --> 50:43.117
You did, didn't you?

50:46.789 --> 50:49.123
Yeah, I did. Why, is it yours?

50:49.333 --> 50:51.584
No, it's yours.

50:58.632 --> 51:00.883
You learning to play it?

51:03.220 --> 51:06.472
I wouldn't put on any concerts yet.

51:06.639 --> 51:07.681
I'm trying.

51:07.891 --> 51:10.642
Great. So I'm sorry,
I don't mean to pry...

51:10.810 --> 51:14.562
...about the pudding and
the harmonium and everything...

51:14.730 --> 51:18.107
- Not at all.
- You must travel quite a lot.

51:18.275 --> 51:21.944
Oh, no, no, no. I don't travel.

51:25.031 --> 51:26.031
No?

51:27.825 --> 51:29.993
You want to take a left up here.

51:30.160 --> 51:32.703
Okay, I'm gonna go.

51:32.913 --> 51:37.166
Good to see you again. Good to see
your face again and go out with you.

51:37.376 --> 51:41.462
I'll be back in town in a few days.
But if you come to Hawaii...

51:41.713 --> 51:44.506
- I don't know. We'll see.
- You don't think you'll go?

51:44.757 --> 51:48.510
- I'll call you when I get back.
- Okay.

51:50.846 --> 51:52.472
Have a good trip.

51:52.765 --> 51:55.058
And bye-bye.

52:01.856 --> 52:04.232
And bye-bye.

52:05.067 --> 52:07.860
And bye-bye. You fucking...

52:08.445 --> 52:11.239
And bye-bye.
You stupid motherfucker.

52:18.621 --> 52:21.039
Are you Barry?

52:23.418 --> 52:26.795
- Yes.
- This is for you.

52:30.632 --> 52:32.716
Okay.

52:39.432 --> 52:42.767
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

52:46.105 --> 52:48.272
This is Barry.

52:48.398 --> 52:50.649
It's me. It's Lena.

52:51.568 --> 52:53.485
Hi.

52:54.112 --> 52:56.321
I just wanted you to know...

52:56.531 --> 53:00.158
...wherever you're going
or whatever you're doing right now...

53:00.367 --> 53:03.953
...I want you to know that
I wanted to kiss you just then.

53:04.704 --> 53:06.663
Really?

53:07.415 --> 53:09.499
Yeah.

54:18.104 --> 54:21.064
- That was good.
- Yeah.

54:21.232 --> 54:25.443
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

54:27.613 --> 54:30.907
I don't freak out very often.

54:31.116 --> 54:32.700
What do you mean?

54:32.868 --> 54:35.870
No matter what my sister says, okay?

54:36.287 --> 54:40.081
- I don't know what you mean.
- I don't freak out.

54:40.249 --> 54:41.958
Okay.

54:42.167 --> 54:46.170
- Have a good trip.
- Thank you.

55:52.898 --> 55:58.236
So I got $500. That's maximum.
That's what I can take out in a day.

55:58.445 --> 55:59.946
Okay.

56:00.113 --> 56:02.656
This is what you get
when you're a pervert.

56:02.824 --> 56:06.827
Said you'd help and you didn't,
so we'll take this money to her...

56:07.037 --> 56:08.871
...and that's that.

56:09.080 --> 56:12.833
Okay, but before you guys go,
I want to bring up one thing:

56:12.999 --> 56:14.333
I said no to Georgia.

56:14.501 --> 56:19.046
She wanted the money, and I had
to decline. I don't have that much.

56:19.214 --> 56:22.299
That money I gave you
is a lot of money to me.

56:22.508 --> 56:23.633
Ninety-nine cents.

56:23.801 --> 56:28.054
So I don't know if this is fair.
Wait, whoa. No. No, plea--

56:33.435 --> 56:38.606
Want to fuck with what my brothers are
saying? Fuck with my family? Fuck!

57:03.129 --> 57:05.588
Help me!

57:07.049 --> 57:08.967
Help me.

57:34.532 --> 57:38.285
Where the fuck are you going?
We know where you live.

57:50.463 --> 57:51.671
Good morning.

57:51.881 --> 57:54.674
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

57:54.883 --> 57:56.884
Come on in here.

57:58.387 --> 58:00.263
Let's shut--

58:06.186 --> 58:09.396
- I got in trouble last night.
- What happened?

58:09.564 --> 58:11.690
I made a phone call.

58:11.858 --> 58:14.776
Come here. Come here.

58:14.944 --> 58:17.487
Barry, come here.

58:29.665 --> 58:31.666
I better get more pudding.

58:31.834 --> 58:36.003
Barry, telephone on line one.
Barry, telephone on line one.

58:36.171 --> 58:37.963
- This is Barry.
- It's Rhonda.

58:38.173 --> 58:41.258
I need to talk to you about
smashing the windows--

58:41.426 --> 58:44.928
- I'm going out of town for two days.
- Where you going?

58:45.138 --> 58:48.306
- Hawaii. But you can't tell my sisters.
- Hawaii?

58:48.474 --> 58:52.644
- That is so wonderful.
- Just don't tell my sisters.

58:52.852 --> 58:56.271
I have to get more pudding
for this trip to Hawaii.

58:56.439 --> 58:59.441
I realize it sounds strange,
but it's not.

58:59.650 --> 59:03.028
- So would you like to come with me?
- Right now?

59:03.195 --> 59:05.071
Yes.

59:05.322 --> 59:09.909
I saw the teriyaki chicken for $1.79,
then the soup was a real deal.

59:10.119 --> 59:14.914
But to stumble across the pudding,
it's tremendous how people don't look.

59:15.040 --> 59:19.126
They don't look at the fine print.
Oh, my.

59:19.294 --> 59:20.919
Okay!

59:31.387 --> 59:35.474
You can go to places in the world
with pudding. That is funny.

59:35.641 --> 59:37.601
That's funny.

59:43.065 --> 59:44.941
Yes!

59:53.408 --> 59:55.075
It's gonna work.

59:55.243 --> 59:59.955
I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming.
Lena, I'm coming.

01:00:00.122 --> 01:00:03.082
- I'm gonna get on line.
- Lena. Aloha.

01:00:03.250 --> 01:00:06.335
- Barry, I'll be on line.
- Okay. I'm coming.

01:00:06.503 --> 01:00:08.087
Okay.

01:00:09.672 --> 01:00:13.550
What do you mean? It doesn't say
six to eight weeks anywhere.

01:00:13.718 --> 01:00:17.095
It takes that long to process
and validate the order.

01:00:17.263 --> 01:00:19.514
I had this planned in my mind, okay?

01:00:19.723 --> 01:00:23.351
I could get the pudding to you today.
I'm leaving today.

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:26.479
I've explained this.
It takes time to process.

01:00:26.688 --> 01:00:30.399
How am I supposed to know this
if you don't tell me this?

01:00:30.608 --> 01:00:34.318
If it's not in the fine print.
That's an impossibility.

01:00:34.528 --> 01:00:38.364
- It takes time to process.
- I didn't see a six or an eight.

01:00:38.532 --> 01:00:44.078
- This is bullcrap to me.
- That's how long it takes to process.

01:00:44.287 --> 01:00:46.163
Hello?

01:00:46.539 --> 01:00:48.373
Hello?

01:00:50.376 --> 01:00:52.294
Hello?

01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:13.854
All right!

01:01:15.273 --> 01:01:19.651
The pudding takes six to eight weeks
to process, so that won't work.

01:01:19.819 --> 01:01:24.906
I'll take a bath on that today.
But here's what I'm gonna tell you.

01:01:25.116 --> 01:01:28.827
- Now, the pudding...
- Yeah?

01:01:29.954 --> 01:01:32.497
- You okay?
- The chair broke.

01:01:32.622 --> 01:01:36.166
We'll get to the pudding later.
I'm gonna go now.

01:01:36.375 --> 01:01:38.293
I'll call you from there.

01:01:38.461 --> 01:01:41.421
- You run the place till I'm back.
- No doubt.

01:01:41.547 --> 01:01:45.425
- Don't tell my sisters anything, okay?
- Absolutely.

01:02:00.231 --> 01:02:02.107
- Good afternoon.
- Thank you.

01:02:02.316 --> 01:02:05.777
- Have a great flight.
- Thanks very much.

01:02:31.968 --> 01:02:35.304
I've never been on a plane before.

01:02:37.139 --> 01:02:41.100
- What was that sound?
- I don't know.

01:03:11.253 --> 01:03:13.421
- Hi.
- Hi. Where you wanna go?

01:03:13.588 --> 01:03:17.591
Could you take me to where
the beach is and the hotels are?

01:03:17.801 --> 01:03:20.469
And I'm gonna need a phone.

01:03:27.602 --> 01:03:28.602
Hello?

01:03:28.769 --> 01:03:30.520
- It's me.
- What are you doing?

01:03:30.688 --> 01:03:34.565
Nothing, I'm at work. I was wondering
about your friend Lena.

01:03:34.692 --> 01:03:36.109
Yeah, what about her?

01:03:36.276 --> 01:03:39.945
I was wondering if you know
where she's staying in Hawaii.

01:03:40.154 --> 01:03:42.113
She left her pocketbook here.

01:03:42.281 --> 01:03:45.450
I wanna get it to her,
make sure she's not nervous.

01:03:45.617 --> 01:03:48.995
I know exactly where she's staying,
and you're lying.

01:03:49.204 --> 01:03:52.665
She didn't forget her purse.
Why do you want her number?

01:03:52.833 --> 01:03:55.125
- Don't do this.
- Why do you want it?

01:03:55.293 --> 01:03:57.503
- All I want is her number.
- Why?

01:03:57.754 --> 01:04:00.339
- Don't treat me this way.
- Do you like her?

01:04:00.506 --> 01:04:03.633
- You're killing me.
- Oh, my God. Calm down.

01:04:03.843 --> 01:04:06.344
All I want is her fucking number!

01:04:06.512 --> 01:04:10.848
Give me that fucking number.
You hear me? I'm sick of this shit!

01:04:10.974 --> 01:04:15.603
Stop fucking treating me this way.
I'll fucking kill you. You want that?

01:04:16.896 --> 01:04:20.898
- Aloha, Sheraton Waikiki.
- Hi, yes. Lena Leonard's room.

01:04:21.066 --> 01:04:24.193
- Okay, one moment.
- Thank you.

01:04:28.031 --> 01:04:29.615
Hello?

01:04:29.824 --> 01:04:31.408
Hello?

01:04:33.411 --> 01:04:37.330
- Is Lena there?
- You have the wrong room.

01:04:41.085 --> 01:04:43.211
Aloha, Sheraton Waikiki.

01:04:43.379 --> 01:04:47.382
Hi. I just called. I think I was
connected to the wrong room.

01:04:47.548 --> 01:04:52.344
I'm looking for a Lena Leonard.
There shouldn't be a man in that room.

01:04:53.929 --> 01:04:56.347
One moment, please.

01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:59.267
Thank you.

01:05:03.063 --> 01:05:04.939
Hello?

01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:07.608
- Lena!
- Yeah?

01:05:07.817 --> 01:05:09.985
Hi, this is Barry Egan.

01:05:10.153 --> 01:05:14.114
Oh, wow, yeah?! That's great!
You came, you came!

01:05:14.282 --> 01:05:16.866
- What are you doing?
- I didn't hear you!

01:05:17.033 --> 01:05:19.410
I just want to know
what you're doing?

01:05:19.577 --> 01:05:23.330
- Where are you?
- I'm calling you. I'm in my hotel room!

01:05:23.539 --> 01:05:26.458
Yeah, I'm just down here
on my business trip!

01:05:26.626 --> 01:05:29.878
Let's do something, then.
You want to do something?

01:05:30.004 --> 01:05:33.464
Yeah! You don't have a boyfriend
or anything, do you?

01:05:33.632 --> 01:05:36.759
- No! What do you mean?
- I just wanted to know.

01:05:36.927 --> 01:05:41.097
- When's the last time you had one?
- About six months ago. Why?

01:05:41.264 --> 01:05:45.350
- I just wanted to make sure.
- When did you last have a girlfriend?

01:05:45.518 --> 01:05:47.728
- Were you ever married?
- Yeah.

01:05:47.896 --> 01:05:51.273
Okay. How long were you married for?

01:05:51.398 --> 01:05:54.108
Do you want to meet
and talk about this?

01:05:54.317 --> 01:05:57.653
Okay. Where are you from originally?

01:07:08.676 --> 01:07:10.511
I'm here.

01:07:58.513 --> 01:08:01.556
You got me out of my hotel room.

01:08:02.266 --> 01:08:05.268
You came and got me out of my room.

01:08:07.146 --> 01:08:09.105
It's so nice.

01:08:17.572 --> 01:08:20.908
It really looks like Hawaii here.

01:09:55.745 --> 01:09:59.288
I'm sorry. I forgot to shave.

01:09:59.748 --> 01:10:02.583
Your face is so adorable...

01:10:02.751 --> 01:10:05.419
...and your skin and your cheek.

01:10:05.628 --> 01:10:07.921
I want to bite it.

01:10:08.172 --> 01:10:13.426
I want to bite your cheek
and chew on it. It's so fucking cute.

01:10:15.137 --> 01:10:20.057
I'm looking at your face
and I just want to smash it.

01:10:20.225 --> 01:10:23.685
I just want to fucking smash it
with a sledgehammer...

01:10:23.853 --> 01:10:26.313
...and squeeze it. You're so pretty.

01:10:26.481 --> 01:10:30.734
I want to chew your face,
and I want to scoop out your eyes...

01:10:30.943 --> 01:10:35.655
...and I want to eat them.
Chew them and suck on them.

01:10:36.949 --> 01:10:38.950
Okay.

01:10:39.450 --> 01:10:42.827
- This is funny.
- Yeah.

01:10:43.037 --> 01:10:45.330
This is nice.

01:10:57.092 --> 01:11:02.763
At that restaurant, I beat up
the bathroom. I'm sorry.

01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:15.690
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:11:15.858 --> 01:11:20.695
They need to see the new 4-84s
to make sure it works with their OC.

01:11:20.863 --> 01:11:25.783
- Okay. What should I do about Eric?
- Just tell him to call me.

01:11:25.951 --> 01:11:29.829
- Okay. So did my brother call you?
- No.

01:11:29.996 --> 01:11:33.916
I don't know what he's doing.
I'm sorry that didn't work out.

01:11:34.125 --> 01:11:36.835
- It's fine.
- You don't wanna date him anyway.

01:11:37.003 --> 01:11:41.923
- Honestly, he's a freak sometimes.
- Yeah, he did seem a little strange.

01:11:42.048 --> 01:11:46.552
Well, he's not that strange.
Don't say that.

01:11:47.553 --> 01:11:52.432
- You're right. I'm sorry.
- I think he's weird, but that's me.

01:11:54.477 --> 01:11:59.063
- Okay. So should I call you later?
- That's okay.

01:11:59.273 --> 01:12:03.109
I'll just see you when you get back.
Okay, bye.

01:12:11.034 --> 01:12:15.120
- So where do you have to go?
- For what?

01:12:15.579 --> 01:12:17.580
For work.

01:12:19.082 --> 01:12:23.460
I don't have any business here.
I came here for you.

01:12:45.564 --> 01:12:49.192
- Hello there, guy.
- Hi, look. This is Bar--

01:12:49.359 --> 01:12:52.820
You have almost reached me,
but not quite.

01:12:53.029 --> 01:12:57.616
I'm shaving my roommate's pussy
right now, so I'm a bit distracted.

01:12:57.826 --> 01:13:01.995
Leave your name and home phone
number, area code first, please.

01:13:02.121 --> 01:13:06.166
I'll call you back as soon as I'm done.
God, she's so sexy.

01:13:06.334 --> 01:13:07.375
Bye, honey.

01:13:07.543 --> 01:13:11.963
This is Barry Egan. I'm calling
about what took place the other night.

01:13:12.131 --> 01:13:16.092
I wanted to tell everybody
it was not fair what you did to me.

01:13:16.301 --> 01:13:20.221
I am expecting my money back.
I realize you have my number.

01:13:20.387 --> 01:13:24.932
I'm on vacation now. If you want
to reach me, shortly I will be home...

01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:28.227
...and we can discuss
how you can return my money.

01:13:28.395 --> 01:13:32.314
Otherwise, I'm pretty sure
that the police can be contacted...

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:36.151
...and I could do that,
and I feel like it's warranted.

01:13:36.277 --> 01:13:39.863
So let's figure something out.

01:13:40.072 --> 01:13:45.410
Like I said, I'll be home shortly.
Give me a call. Okay, thank you.

01:14:03.010 --> 01:14:05.970
How many airplanes
have you been on?

01:14:07.055 --> 01:14:10.307
I think, maybe over a hundred.

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:15.187
- That's right, you travel a lot.
- Yeah.

01:14:19.066 --> 01:14:22.944
How much do you travel?
Do you travel all the time?

01:14:25.196 --> 01:14:27.572
Forgot about that.

01:14:30.034 --> 01:14:33.161
Can I come home with you
when we get there?

01:14:33.454 --> 01:14:35.246
Of course.

01:14:35.414 --> 01:14:37.415
Is it okay to ask that?

01:14:41.002 --> 01:14:44.171
I thought that you were anyways.

01:15:24.459 --> 01:15:26.251
Come here.

01:15:46.645 --> 01:15:47.687
Are you okay?

01:15:47.855 --> 01:15:50.815
- Yes, I'm fine. Are you okay?
- Yes. I'm sorry.

01:15:50.941 --> 01:15:55.027
- What is this?
- It's okay. It's okay.

01:15:55.946 --> 01:15:59.239
Follow the penlight
with your eyes, okay?

01:16:00.282 --> 01:16:04.076
People are just crazy
in this world, I think.

01:16:55.875 --> 01:17:00.169
- Hi. Janice the operator. Who's this?
- This is Barry Egan.

01:17:00.296 --> 01:17:04.173
- We talked. Do you remember?
- No, sweetie, I don't remember.

01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:07.926
Cut the crap, lady!
You said your name was Georgia.

01:17:08.093 --> 01:17:11.721
You said our conversation
was confidential! I trusted you.

01:17:11.930 --> 01:17:16.350
And then you called me
and asked for money! Am I right?!

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:17.768
- Am I right?!
- Sir--

01:17:17.936 --> 01:17:20.020
Get your supervisor on the phone!

01:17:20.188 --> 01:17:23.899
I want whoever owns that place
on the phone! You hear me?!

01:17:24.067 --> 01:17:28.445
- Can you wait a second, please?
- No more bullcrap! I'm not kidding!!

01:17:38.788 --> 01:17:40.664
- Yeah, this is Dean.
- It's me.

01:17:40.915 --> 01:17:45.710
Barry Egan's on the other line.
He wants to talk to a supervisor.

01:17:45.878 --> 01:17:47.462
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

01:17:47.671 --> 01:17:49.630
- Put him through.
- This is bad--

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:51.382
Will you shut up?

01:17:52.050 --> 01:17:55.094
Okay, sexy. I'll connect you
with my supervisor.

01:17:55.262 --> 01:17:57.471
You're in trouble, honey.

01:17:58.598 --> 01:17:59.598
Who's this?

01:17:59.808 --> 01:18:02.601
My name's Barry Egan.
I called your service--

01:18:02.769 --> 01:18:05.270
- Why don't you shut the fuck up?
- What?

01:18:05.438 --> 01:18:07.647
Calm down.
What's the problem?

01:18:07.856 --> 01:18:11.108
The problem is, if you let
me explain, your employee...

01:18:11.276 --> 01:18:15.112
...that girl who I was just speaking with,
has been threatening me.

01:18:15.321 --> 01:18:18.281
And four blond gentlemen
just attacked me...

01:18:18.449 --> 01:18:21.743
...and smashed my car
and hurt my girl.

01:18:21.952 --> 01:18:27.164
Go fuck yourself. That has nothing to
do with me. I run a legitimate business.

01:18:27.291 --> 01:18:28.541
Listen to me.

01:18:28.792 --> 01:18:33.128
- What's your name, sir?! Answer me!
- What's your name, asshole?!

01:18:33.296 --> 01:18:34.588
I'm Barry Egan!

01:18:34.839 --> 01:18:37.382
How do I know?!
You could be anybody!

01:18:37.550 --> 01:18:42.512
You have no right taking people's
confidence in your service!

01:18:42.679 --> 01:18:46.432
- You're sick!
- No, shut up! Shut the fuck up!

01:18:46.599 --> 01:18:49.518
You have no right
to take people's trust.

01:18:49.644 --> 01:18:54.064
Shut up! Shut! Shut!
Shut! Shut! Shut up!

01:18:54.357 --> 01:18:55.774
Shut up!

01:18:56.567 --> 01:18:59.444
Now! Are you threatening me, dick?!

01:18:59.612 --> 01:19:00.903
Why don't you--?

01:19:01.071 --> 01:19:03.156
You go fuck yourself!

01:19:08.036 --> 01:19:11.538
You-- Fuck! Did you just say,
"Go fuck myself"?

01:19:14.917 --> 01:19:16.125
Yes, I did.

01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:20.004
That wasn't good!
You're dead!

01:19:22.424 --> 01:19:23.590
Is there--?

01:19:23.758 --> 01:19:28.512
Is that guy in the blue suit, is he
just around the corner? Can you...?

01:19:28.679 --> 01:19:31.264
Yes, there's a police officer here.

01:19:31.474 --> 01:19:34.100
No, the guy who came with me.
Is he there?

01:19:34.268 --> 01:19:37.770
I'm not sure. We can ask
the receptionist to get him.

01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:40.147
He's probably in the waiting room.

01:20:12.469 --> 01:20:13.678
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

01:20:13.846 --> 01:20:17.974
There was a blond woman in there.
Did they move her room?

01:20:18.182 --> 01:20:21.434
- What's her name, sir?
- Lena Leonard.

01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:24.020
- Are you a relative?
- Yes.

01:20:24.188 --> 01:20:28.232
- Just a minute. Let me check for you.
- Okay.

01:20:29.568 --> 01:20:34.196
- She was discharged this evening.
- She was discharged, okay.

01:20:47.125 --> 01:20:51.628
Welcome to Directory Assistance.
City and state, please.

01:20:51.796 --> 01:20:54.297
Somewhere in Utah.

01:20:54.590 --> 01:20:56.424
Thank you.

01:20:59.970 --> 01:21:01.554
What listing?

01:21:01.722 --> 01:21:05.766
Can I have the listing
for D&D Mattress Man?

01:22:10.784 --> 01:22:13.036
- Fuck you.
- No.

01:22:13.245 --> 01:22:15.371
You're a pervert.

01:22:16.081 --> 01:22:19.500
Think you can be a pervert
and not pay for it?

01:22:20.168 --> 01:22:21.752
Don't you say that to me.

01:22:22.087 --> 01:22:25.214
- You called the phone-sex--
- Shut up.

01:22:27.382 --> 01:22:29.175
I didn't do anything.

01:22:29.968 --> 01:22:34.388
I'm a nice man.
I mind my own business.

01:22:34.597 --> 01:22:40.519
So you tell me that's that
before I beat the hell from you.

01:22:42.396 --> 01:22:46.483
I have so much strength in me.
You have no idea.

01:22:49.403 --> 01:22:52.154
I have a love in my life.

01:22:52.364 --> 01:22:56.992
It makes me stronger
than anything you can imagine.

01:22:57.576 --> 01:23:01.370
I would say that's that, Mattress Man.

01:23:10.922 --> 01:23:14.383
You came all the way
from L.A. to tell me this?

01:23:14.550 --> 01:23:16.301
Yes, I did.

01:23:20.931 --> 01:23:23.016
Tell the cops?

01:23:24.435 --> 01:23:26.102
No.

01:23:29.981 --> 01:23:31.773
All right.

01:23:33.275 --> 01:23:35.234
That's that.

01:23:46.913 --> 01:23:51.249
- Now, get the fuck out of here, pervert!
- Didn't I warn you?!

01:23:51.376 --> 01:23:53.293
That's that.

01:24:07.598 --> 01:24:11.351
- Barry, you okay? What's going on?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

01:24:11.518 --> 01:24:12.560
Where you been?

01:24:12.770 --> 01:24:17.732
I was in Utah, but now I'm here
and I'll be right back.

01:24:18.025 --> 01:24:19.775
Barry?

01:24:23.488 --> 01:24:25.531
Where you going?

01:24:54.975 --> 01:24:56.809
Lena.

01:24:57.143 --> 01:24:59.353
I'm so sorry.

01:24:59.521 --> 01:25:03.899
I'm so sorry I left you
at the hospital.

01:25:04.608 --> 01:25:07.568
I called a phone-sex line--

01:25:07.736 --> 01:25:11.613
I called a phone-sex line
before I met you...

01:25:11.781 --> 01:25:15.784
...and four blond brothers
came after me...

01:25:15.993 --> 01:25:19.162
...and they hurt you, and I'm sorry.

01:25:19.288 --> 01:25:23.082
Then I had to leave again
because I wanted to make sure...

01:25:23.209 --> 01:25:25.793
...you never got hurt again.

01:25:26.462 --> 01:25:29.297
And I have a lot of pudding...

01:25:29.464 --> 01:25:33.717
...and in six to eight weeks,
it can be redeemed.

01:25:33.927 --> 01:25:37.721
So if you could just give me
that much time...

01:25:37.888 --> 01:25:42.433
...I think I can get enough mileage
to go with you wherever you go...

01:25:42.601 --> 01:25:45.102
...if you have to travel
for your work.

01:25:45.270 --> 01:25:48.939
Because I don't ever want
to be anywhere without you.

01:25:49.107 --> 01:25:53.485
So could you just let me
redeem the mileage?

01:25:53.653 --> 01:25:57.781
- You left me at the hospital.
- I'm sorry.

01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:00.450
You can't do that.

01:26:01.493 --> 01:26:04.453
If you just give me
six to eight weeks...

01:26:04.621 --> 01:26:06.580
...I can redeem the mileage...

01:26:06.748 --> 01:26:10.543
...and I can go with you
wherever you have to travel.

01:27:11.265 --> 01:27:13.516
So here we go.
