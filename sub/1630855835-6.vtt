09:48.755 --> 09:51.923
Everyone would get a turn
as classroom star of the week,

09:51.925 --> 09:54.634
But new plan.
Uh, stewie will now be

09:54.678 --> 09:56.219
Star of the week every week.

09:56.263 --> 09:59.306
Also, instead of circle time,
we're just gonna watch tv dramas

09:59.308 --> 10:01.057

plays a fireman.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.518
That's a pretty smart cookie,
that teacher jeremy.

10:03.562 --> 10:06.146

Oh, god, I don't got
nothing prepared.

in my pockets here.

10:13.280 --> 10:16.323

reward card.

full of shark teeth.

parking garage.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.080
Zippo lighter I got in cancun.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.206

you'd go anywhere else.

10:26.627 --> 10:29.961
Uh, flat, dry condom
in case charlene's ovulating.

10:30.005 --> 10:31.546
Uh, clipping
of a newspaper story

10:31.590 --> 10:33.381
Where I'm quoted
about a house fire.

10:33.425 --> 10:35.333
And a bloody shoe
from the marathon bombing

10:35.335 --> 10:37.052

in my closet.

at hearing the whispers

10:58.033 --> 10:59.574
Of nearby diners.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.986
Excuse me, smushboy.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.955

from the beginning. Geez.

11:36.279 --> 11:37.696
What the hell, chris?

11:37.698 --> 11:39.823
You've had a crummy attitude
from the moment

11:39.866 --> 11:41.074
You walked in here this morning.

11:41.076 --> 11:43.076
Well, duh.
The moment I walk in

11:43.078 --> 11:45.412
You start running
new pie designs at me.

11:45.455 --> 11:47.163
What do we do with
pie designs, meg?

11:47.207 --> 11:49.207

12:04.099 --> 12:07.183
Sorting these things out,

12:07.227 --> 12:09.018
Do summer fridays anymore.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.604
Oh, now you're
paying attention.

12:11.648 --> 12:14.107
Chris, you can't
talk to people like that.

12:14.151 --> 12:15.775
Oh, fine.
Then maybe I'll talk like this.

12:15.861 --> 12:18.278
Everyone, I quit!

12:31.001 --> 12:33.877
Good night, stewie,
at 11:45 p.M.,

12:33.920 --> 12:36.546
Which is a bedtime
that works for you.

12:36.590 --> 12:39.716
I love you, sweetie. Mwah.

12:42.888 --> 12:44.888
Hey, that was kind of nice
what just happened right there.

12:44.931 --> 12:47.265
-What do you mean?
-Well, you got a kiss
from your mom,

12:47.309 --> 12:48.808
And not just 'cause
you blew into that tube

12:48.852 --> 12:50.101
That lets her start the car.

12:50.145 --> 12:51.728
You know, I always
wanted to get adopted

12:51.772 --> 12:52.937
And have parents of my own.

12:52.981 --> 12:54.898
Heck, my old orphanage
even has its annual

12:54.983 --> 12:56.274
Adoption fair next week, but

12:56.318 --> 12:57.859
Forget it, nobody wants to adopt

12:57.861 --> 12:59.110
A messed-up kid like me.

12:59.154 --> 13:00.570
Hey, hey, hey.

on my white area rug?

You want to get adopted?

13:10.207 --> 13:11.831
-What?
-Starting tomorrow,

13:11.875 --> 13:14.876
I will teach you how to be
a normal, adoptable child.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.753
Aw, dude, that's awesome.

13:16.797 --> 13:17.796
All right, good night, kiddo.

13:17.839 --> 13:19.163
I'm gonna go hide out
in the dry tub

13:19.216 --> 13:20.465
And watch your sister
take a wizz.

for filling in

all big-headed and quit.

13:31.394 --> 13:33.686

these videos with you.

13:33.730 --> 13:35.230
Yeah, um, about the videos--

13:35.232 --> 13:36.981
I couldn't help but notice

13:37.025 --> 13:39.567
You've got me squatting
on generic jell-o,

13:39.611 --> 13:40.819
Not the name brand.

13:44.741 --> 13:46.324
You're-you're adorable.

13:46.368 --> 13:49.118
And why am I snorting
regular cocaine

13:49.120 --> 13:51.913
When I specifically requested
bacon-wrapped cocaine?

13:51.915 --> 13:54.123
There's no such thing
as bacon-wrapped cocaine.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.501
Yeah, tell that
to chris farley's autopsy photo.

13:56.545 --> 13:58.711
Also, your nose
is bleeding heavily.

Yeah, that's allergies. I'm
allergic to bacon and cocaine.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.968

unprofessional film set

To turn you into a normal,
regular kid who can be adopted.

So, chris,
after your recent adventure

20:06.956 --> 20:09.498
Behind the scenes
of the adult video world,

20:09.542 --> 20:12.210
You're probably not even
able to enjoy pornography any--

20:12.295 --> 20:14.086
Wrong!

20:14.130 --> 20:16.881
Uh, okay.
Well, I got to go to

20:16.966 --> 20:18.132
The county registrar's office.

20:18.176 --> 20:20.259
Need to re-register
our business as inactive

20:20.303 --> 20:22.220
And change our filing status.

Hey, gavin.
Yeah, it's dad.

20:38.363 --> 20:41.447
Well, the court say I get
two guaranteed calls a week,

20:41.491 --> 20:44.116
So I'm calling.
[chuckles]

20:44.160 --> 20:47.370
Can you please tell your mother
to get off the extension?

20:47.413 --> 20:50.414
No, in-person visits
have to be supervised,

20:50.458 --> 20:52.833
But the calls do not
have to be supervised,

20:52.877 --> 20:55.378
So she can
get off the phone now.

20:55.421 --> 20:59.006
Daddy knows what mommy's
breathing sounds like, bud.

20:59.008 --> 21:01.217
Get off the phone, janet!
