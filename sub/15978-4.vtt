WEBVTT

00:04.172 --> 00:06.074
Hey, sorry we're late
with the snacks.

00:06.107 --> 00:07.208
We left the house late,

00:07.241 --> 00:09.643
plus we had a little situation
at the grocery store.

00:09.677 --> 00:12.146
Yeah, thanks
to that uppity cashier.

00:12.180 --> 00:13.514
You should have
seen her face

00:13.547 --> 00:15.783
when I asked her to double-bag
our ice cream in plastic.

00:15.816 --> 00:17.585
It was like I was
using a chain saw

00:17.618 --> 00:19.120
to cut my way
through the Amazon.

00:19.153 --> 00:21.722
How dare she?

00:21.755 --> 00:23.191
I'm the original recycler.

00:23.224 --> 00:26.127
This shirt used to be
a curtain.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.629
Oh, God, let's just keep
the curtains closed, huh?

00:30.631 --> 00:33.367
Wait, you guys haven't
ordered a movie yet?

00:33.401 --> 00:35.803
No. Dad's taking forever
to pick.

00:35.836 --> 00:37.538
The alternative is
to let Mikayla pick,

00:37.571 --> 00:39.273
and then we end up watching
The Muppets

00:39.307 --> 00:41.275
for the 20th time this month.
Yeah, and frankly,

00:41.309 --> 00:44.345
I think Mikayla's too young
to be seeing Gonzo's nose.

00:44.378 --> 00:46.780
Tom, please let me
cut your hair.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.816
You look like you got
a mullet on backwards.

00:48.849 --> 00:51.585
The only person I trust
to cut my hair is Carol,

00:51.619 --> 00:53.821
and she said I lost
that privilege in the divorce.

00:53.854 --> 00:55.856
Your dad had
a little bit of an incident

00:55.889 --> 00:57.125
with a barber a few years ago.

00:57.158 --> 01:00.661
The guy wasn't paying attention
and he stabbed me in the eye!

01:00.694 --> 01:01.862
He nicked him.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.831
He almost blinded me.

01:03.864 --> 01:06.800
There's still three shades
of green I can't see.

01:06.834 --> 01:10.338
I go from mint to hunter.

01:10.371 --> 01:13.674
Emerald, kelly and forest? Gone!

01:15.209 --> 01:17.778
You can use my barrette
if you want, Grandpa.

01:17.811 --> 01:20.281
Ah, thanks, sweetie.
(sighs)

01:21.682 --> 01:22.816
Mom, come on.

01:22.850 --> 01:24.652
Would you please just cut
the man's hair?

01:24.685 --> 01:27.688
He looks like he's in some sort
of senior citizens boy band.

01:29.457 --> 01:31.759
He should have thought of
that before he left me.

01:31.792 --> 01:35.596
Besides, I'm too busy taking
care of the new man in my life.

01:35.629 --> 01:36.797
You.

01:39.833 --> 01:42.536
How do I look?

01:42.570 --> 01:44.372
Like someone who's about
to watch The Muppets.

01:44.405 --> 01:45.573
ALL:
No!

01:45.606 --> 01:46.707
(TV beeps, all groan)

01:46.740 --> 01:49.843
No, it's fine with me.
That little gray frog is a hoot.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.769
NATHAN: But what
the birthday boy doesn't realize

02:15.803 --> 02:19.540
is that the costumed bear is
actually his decorated father

02:19.573 --> 02:22.576
returning home from
a second tour in Afghanistan.

02:24.578 --> 02:25.879
Dad!

02:25.913 --> 02:28.216
Son! (laughs)

02:28.249 --> 02:30.551
(yawns):
So heartwarming.

02:30.584 --> 02:32.386
RAY:
Look at you, Nate.

02:32.420 --> 02:34.222
This is not the first
time this has happened.

02:34.255 --> 02:36.890
If you keep yawning, we're gonna
get stuck doing traffic,

02:36.924 --> 02:39.660
and you know how I feel
about helicopters!

02:39.693 --> 02:41.929
They defy the laws of nature.

02:41.962 --> 02:43.364
No wings!

02:43.397 --> 02:44.798
Name one thing in
nature that flies around

02:44.832 --> 02:46.400
with a giant propeller
on its head

02:46.434 --> 02:48.269
and a smaller one sticking
out of its ass!

02:50.704 --> 02:52.340
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

02:52.373 --> 02:53.707
I'm not tired.

02:53.741 --> 02:56.810
My mom takes her bra off at 7:30
every night to watch Jeopardy,

02:56.844 --> 03:00.548
so I try to make sure
I'm in bed by 7:29.

03:00.581 --> 03:01.749
Well, according to
the Internet,

03:01.782 --> 03:04.285
if you're not tired,
yawning can be a sign

03:04.318 --> 03:05.686
of stress or anxiety.

03:05.719 --> 03:07.388
Okay, so maybe I'm stressed.
Life can be stressful.

03:07.421 --> 03:08.722
What am I gonna do about it?

03:08.756 --> 03:11.559
Well, lucky you know me.
I got a guy.

03:11.592 --> 03:12.860
Yeah, last time you had a guy,

03:12.893 --> 03:14.962
I ended up getting my teeth
whitened in a van.

03:14.995 --> 03:16.530
And?

03:16.564 --> 03:18.866
And viewers wrote in
about my dazzling smile.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.968
(laughs)
You're damn right they did.

03:21.001 --> 03:23.537
So trust me when I tell you,
I got another guy.

03:23.571 --> 03:24.538
He's a therapist.

03:24.572 --> 03:25.773
No, no, no, no, no. No.

03:25.806 --> 03:28.008
No, hear me out.
It's not what you think.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.743
This guy's real cool.

03:29.777 --> 03:31.712
No couches,
no tweed jackets.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.681
And he already likes you.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.416
That argument
that you and I had

03:35.449 --> 03:38.852
about sharing ChapStick--
he totally took your side.

03:38.886 --> 03:39.687
(chuckles)

03:39.720 --> 03:40.754
Look, I don't know, man,

03:40.788 --> 03:42.290
I've always felt
secretly superior

03:42.323 --> 03:44.692
about the fact that I've
never been to therapy.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.760
If I lose that, all
I've got is the fact

03:46.794 --> 03:49.863
that I have a nearly
imperceptible sneeze.

03:51.399 --> 03:52.300
God bless you.

03:52.333 --> 03:53.934
Thank you.

03:53.967 --> 03:56.404
Miller, you interested
in anchoring

03:56.437 --> 03:58.306
the 4:00 news
this Saturday?

03:58.339 --> 04:00.474
Phillips has
the stomach flu.

04:00.508 --> 04:01.942
He's blowing it
out both ends

04:01.975 --> 04:04.945
like some kind of
Chinese firecracker.

04:04.978 --> 04:07.515
Well, yeah, are
you kidding?

04:07.548 --> 04:08.916
I'd love to
anchor the news.

04:08.949 --> 04:11.051
I mean, any chance to
get behind that desk

04:11.084 --> 04:12.820
(yawning):
would be very,
very exciting.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.855
Really?

04:14.888 --> 04:16.590
Because you look
about as excited

04:16.624 --> 04:19.560
as my wife watching
me undress.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.962
And believe me, the
feeling is mutual.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.797
Oh, sorry, the yawn.
Yeah, n-no, I just--

04:23.831 --> 04:25.333
I didn't get a lot
of sleep last night.

04:25.366 --> 04:27.801
Well, make sure you get
to bed early on Friday.

04:27.835 --> 04:29.837
Nobody wants to see
their anchor yawn.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.905
The last thing we need
are people realizing

04:31.939 --> 04:33.941
that the news is boring.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.746
Hey, why didn't you tell
me that he was coming?

04:38.779 --> 04:41.882
I didn't hear
his tiny footsteps.

04:41.915 --> 04:44.785
He's so little, he must have
came from under the table.

04:49.357 --> 04:51.659
So, I-I think that's everything
that's been going on

04:51.692 --> 04:53.861
with-with my work
and my family, and-and

04:53.894 --> 04:57.531
I just... I just can't figure
out why I'm yawning so much.

04:57.565 --> 04:58.832
(strums chord)

05:00.634 --> 05:02.403
Thanks for sharing, bro.

05:02.436 --> 05:06.474
Life is a salad bar, and you
got a lot on your plate, man.

05:06.507 --> 05:08.876
What do you feel
is stressing you out the most?

05:08.909 --> 05:10.344
I don't know, it's-it's kind of
hard to pinp...

05:10.378 --> 05:11.945
Oh. Shh.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.881
Don't rush to words.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.816
Use your music.

05:15.849 --> 05:17.918
Tell me with the tambo.

05:19.687 --> 05:21.655
Yeah.

05:21.689 --> 05:22.856
Get a beat.

05:22.890 --> 05:23.924
Yeah, yeah.

05:23.957 --> 05:27.895
When you're making music,
you're making progress.

05:27.928 --> 05:30.698
You got a beat,
now add the lyrics.

05:32.099 --> 05:34.735
* Since I'm paying you,
maybe you can just... *

05:34.768 --> 05:36.437
Tell me what's wrong.

05:36.470 --> 05:38.939
It's your mom, bro.

05:38.972 --> 05:39.807
Whoa... come on, really?

05:39.840 --> 05:41.942
D-Doesn't that seem like
the easy answer?

05:41.975 --> 05:44.945
Dude, you told me yourself, she
lives with you in your house,

05:44.978 --> 05:46.547
all up in your biz.

05:46.580 --> 05:47.848
Well, I'm pretty sure
I said "business,"

05:47.881 --> 05:49.383
but doesn't everybody
come in here

05:49.417 --> 05:51.785
and just "tambo sing"
about their mom?

05:51.819 --> 05:53.521
I don't want to be that guy.

05:53.554 --> 05:56.023
Would it make you feel better
if we called her your roommate?

05:59.460 --> 06:01.595
How is it living
with your roommate?

06:01.629 --> 06:02.730
It's awful.

06:02.763 --> 06:05.132
(treadmill beeps)

06:05.165 --> 06:07.701
You know you can take
your own turn, right?

06:11.939 --> 06:14.808
And if you could, uh, direct me
to a coffee place nearby,

06:14.842 --> 06:15.809
that'd be great.

06:15.843 --> 06:16.744
WOMAN:
Sure, no problem.

06:16.777 --> 06:18.746
Mom, would you please
put the map away?

06:18.779 --> 06:19.980
I will not.

06:20.013 --> 06:21.715
It makes no sense
to pay all this money

06:21.749 --> 06:22.950
to get advice from some stranger

06:22.983 --> 06:25.118
who could easily send us
careening off a bridge

06:25.152 --> 06:27.921
because she's too busy
changing her baby's diaper.

06:27.955 --> 06:31.959
Hey, Mr. Miller, I can call you
back if now is not a good time.

06:31.992 --> 06:35.563
Oh, that's okay, thanks,
it'll never be a good time.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.932
(screams)

06:38.966 --> 06:40.934
Tea tree oil shampoo.

06:40.968 --> 06:42.970
Keeps your hair
from going thin.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.005
I'm in the shower.

06:45.038 --> 06:47.107
So what? You're wearing
your bathing suit.

06:47.140 --> 06:50.043
Because of the last time!

06:51.211 --> 06:53.981
Has your mom always
been this smothering?

06:54.014 --> 06:58.952
Well, uh, she's in my driver's
license photo with me, so...

07:02.923 --> 07:06.126
Yeah, I guess it's a pattern.

07:06.159 --> 07:10.030
All right, well, have you ever
suggested that she move out?

07:10.063 --> 07:12.032
No, I-I couldn't do that.

07:12.065 --> 07:15.102
I mean, she's... she's-she's
seen enough change already.

07:15.135 --> 07:17.070
I mean, I mean, it can't be easy

07:17.104 --> 07:19.907
being single again
after 43 years.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.542
When I think about it,

07:21.575 --> 07:23.043
it's actually amazing
how brave she's been.

07:23.076 --> 07:25.178
That's a really nice thing
to say, bro.

07:25.212 --> 07:27.214
Have you ever thought
of cutting your mom off

07:27.247 --> 07:29.049
a healthy slice
of that truth pie?

07:29.082 --> 07:30.784
Well, it's kind of hard
giving her compliments

07:30.818 --> 07:32.052
when she's so busy
criticizing me.

07:32.085 --> 07:33.987
I haven't even told her
about the anchor gig,

07:34.021 --> 07:35.923
'cause I don't want
to spend two hours

07:35.956 --> 07:37.858
hearing how I pronounce
my T's a li'l weak--

07:37.891 --> 07:40.127
liddle-- little.

07:41.595 --> 07:44.632
Look, dude, I think that maybe
she's concerned about you

07:44.665 --> 07:47.100
because she thinks she's made
such a mess out of her own life,

07:47.134 --> 07:49.937
and maybe if you made her
feel better about herself,

07:49.970 --> 07:51.972
then she'll back off on you.

07:52.005 --> 07:54.808
I guess... I guess
if we're gonna stop arguing,

07:54.842 --> 07:56.276
somebody needs to make
the first move.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.045
I-I could be nicer.

07:58.078 --> 08:00.280
A whole lot of nice
never stressed anyone out.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.982
Well, I am finally getting
a chance

08:02.015 --> 08:03.584
to anchor the news
this Saturday,

08:03.617 --> 08:05.285
and I can't yawn
my way through that.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.287
I mean, I've already got
one strike against me.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.624
I, uh, I threw my 40th
birthday party at Six Flags,

08:10.658 --> 08:14.161
and my boss couldn't ride
any of the rides.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.834
Nathan, don't
get mad at me,

08:20.868 --> 08:23.771
but I had to rinse my
underwear out in the bathroom.

08:26.306 --> 08:28.108
So don't get your panties
in a wad

08:28.141 --> 08:30.143
when you find
my panties in a wad.

08:33.614 --> 08:35.248
You know what?

08:35.282 --> 08:36.884
We're all human.

08:36.917 --> 08:37.951
As roommates, it's good

08:37.985 --> 08:40.020
that we can all be comfortable
around each other.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.190
Good, okay.

08:43.223 --> 08:45.392
Happy to hear it.

08:49.262 --> 08:52.132
(sighs)

08:59.673 --> 09:01.642
What?

09:01.675 --> 09:04.211
Mom, I want you to know
I know you are going

09:04.244 --> 09:06.580
through a lot right now,

09:06.614 --> 09:11.084
and I think that you
are an amazing woman,

09:11.118 --> 09:13.821
and I think that you're
very, very brave.

09:13.854 --> 09:17.290
Nathan, that is so sweet.

09:17.324 --> 09:20.127
Why are you telling me this?

09:20.160 --> 09:23.263
Well, just...
just because.

09:23.296 --> 09:25.032
Because what?

09:25.065 --> 09:27.701
I don't know, because...

09:27.735 --> 09:29.737
because I love you.

09:51.825 --> 09:53.293
I don't understand
what the big deal is.

09:53.326 --> 09:54.795
Nathan's always
nice to you.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.797
Oh, sure, he'll hold
the door for me

09:56.830 --> 10:00.367
or help me get my pantyhose
off after a long hike, but...

10:07.808 --> 10:09.777
...but this was different.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.912
He held my hands,
looked me in the eye,

10:11.945 --> 10:15.215
and told me I was brave.

10:15.248 --> 10:16.283
Who does that?

10:16.316 --> 10:17.384
Well, I don't know.

10:17.417 --> 10:20.287
I mean, I told Dad he was
brave earlier when he agreed

10:20.320 --> 10:22.856
to let Adam get near him
with the scissors.

10:22.890 --> 10:24.191
Actually we're not
quite there yet.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.359
We're still on
finger scissors.

10:26.393 --> 10:30.063
If he does well, we'll
move up to chopsticks.

10:30.097 --> 10:32.265
Something's going on
with your brother,

10:32.299 --> 10:35.435
and if you know what it is,
a mother has a right to know.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.904
Is he on drugs?
Is he sick?

10:36.937 --> 10:38.839
Am I sick?

10:38.872 --> 10:40.173
With what?
No virus would want

10:40.207 --> 10:42.409
to live in such a
hostile environment.

10:42.442 --> 10:43.911
(cackles)
Am I right, Adam?

10:43.944 --> 10:45.913
(gasps)
Ow!

10:45.946 --> 10:46.847
You poked me!

10:46.880 --> 10:48.015
You turned, man.

10:48.048 --> 10:49.817
I made a joke at my
ex-wife's expense.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.719
You're the only other
guy in the room.

10:51.752 --> 10:53.053
You got to
anticipate the turn!

10:54.121 --> 10:55.188
We're done here!

10:55.222 --> 10:57.324
Mikayla, get the big box
of crayons!

10:57.357 --> 10:59.960
I got to see what colors
I lost this time!

11:02.863 --> 11:06.399
Seriously, you need to tell me
what going on with your brother.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.235
Yeah, I told you, Mom,
I don't know, okay?

11:08.268 --> 11:09.469
Why don't you just hide
in his trunk

11:09.502 --> 11:13.406
and see where he's going, like
you did with me in high school?

11:13.440 --> 11:15.308
That was a long time ago.

11:15.342 --> 11:17.845
Things have changed
since then.

11:28.155 --> 11:30.824
Oh.

11:30.858 --> 11:31.959
Welcome to
On Demand Assistance.

11:31.992 --> 11:33.393
How can I help you, Mr. Miller?

11:33.426 --> 11:35.996
I need to speak to
someone who's a mother.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.965
Natalie has children.

11:37.998 --> 11:40.868
Natalie, please.

11:40.901 --> 11:42.235
Welcome to
On Demand Assist...

11:42.269 --> 11:44.872
My name's Carol, and my
son's been acting strange.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.006
I'm worried sick.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.008
I'm asking you,
mother to mother,

11:48.041 --> 11:49.977
to tell me where
he's driven lately

11:50.010 --> 11:52.179
besides work and home.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.014
I'm sorry, ma'am.

11:54.047 --> 11:54.948
That's against regulations.

11:54.982 --> 11:56.049
(phone beeps)

11:56.083 --> 11:57.885
Carol, are you still there?

11:57.918 --> 11:59.219
I had to stop recording.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.021
Yeah, I'm still here.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.056
Good, let's do
some mothering.

12:05.225 --> 12:09.029
How about 6342 Park Road?

12:09.062 --> 12:10.898
It looks like
an office complex.

12:10.931 --> 12:12.866
That could be anything.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.935
I've got an idea.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.536
Thank you for calling
Brayton Credit.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.438
My name is Trisha,
how may I help you?

12:18.471 --> 12:20.240
Do you have children, Trisha?

12:20.273 --> 12:21.909
Seven.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.877
Then you can help us.

12:23.911 --> 12:25.478
We need to know any charges

12:25.512 --> 12:27.881
made by Nathan Miller
at a billing address

12:27.915 --> 12:30.050
of 6342 Park Road.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.352
Nathan's my son,
and he's been acting strange.

12:32.385 --> 12:34.121
Say no more.

12:34.154 --> 12:37.991
I just need his card number
and, for security purposes,

12:38.025 --> 12:40.027
(chuckles) his mother's
maiden name.

12:42.329 --> 12:44.064
At least your son has a job.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.800
My son invested
all his money in a pool cue

12:46.834 --> 12:48.902
with a laser at the end of it.

12:48.936 --> 12:51.371
Now he spends all day on
the couch driving the cat crazy.

12:51.404 --> 12:53.073
(phone ringing)

12:53.106 --> 12:54.407
Dr. Johnson's office.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.309
Did she say
doctor's office?

12:56.343 --> 12:57.945
Oh, my, this could be bad.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.079
Shh.
Uh, excuse me?

12:59.112 --> 13:03.917
Sorry, I need to see a doctor
about my... foot problem.

13:03.951 --> 13:06.119
Would that be something
this type of doctor

13:06.153 --> 13:07.520
could help me with?

13:07.554 --> 13:09.022
Well, not unless
you want to talk

13:09.056 --> 13:11.058
about how your foot
is making you feel.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.993
Dr. Johnson is
a therapist.

13:13.026 --> 13:14.862
A therapist?
Thank you.

13:14.895 --> 13:17.530
Why would he need to see
a therapist?

13:17.564 --> 13:19.166
He has a mother.

13:19.199 --> 13:21.368
Well, it looks like
Natalie's not the only one

13:21.401 --> 13:23.036
with a son on the couch.

13:23.070 --> 13:26.239
Huh? Am I right?
(chuckles)

13:26.273 --> 13:30.110
I hope I have provided you with
excellent customer service.

13:32.079 --> 13:34.948
Dr. Johnson, it's nice
to finally meet you.

13:34.982 --> 13:36.516
It's wonderful
to meet you, too, Carol.

13:36.549 --> 13:37.885
You, too, Tom.

13:37.918 --> 13:41.154
She said if I came,
she'd cut my hair.

13:41.188 --> 13:43.356
Our son Nathan
says you're great,

13:43.390 --> 13:44.925
and I was hoping

13:44.958 --> 13:47.560
Tom and I could work towards
a healthier divorce.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.129
Mm.
Not just for us,

13:49.162 --> 13:50.998
but for our children.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.532
And our children's children.

13:52.565 --> 13:56.103
I just need an inch and a half
taken off the bangs.

13:56.136 --> 13:58.238
Therapy is like
a big body of water.

13:58.271 --> 14:00.473
You can dip your toe
in the little stuff,

14:00.507 --> 14:02.575
but if you want
to make a real splash,

14:02.609 --> 14:05.979
you got to cannonball
right into Lake Iwannatalka.

14:06.013 --> 14:07.881
I think our biggest
problem is

14:07.915 --> 14:11.484
that Nathan's coming to talk to
you because he's... depressed?

14:12.352 --> 14:13.553
In debt?

14:14.421 --> 14:16.023
Being bullied?

14:16.056 --> 14:17.991
Is someone picking on
my little boy?

14:18.025 --> 14:21.028
All right, how about
we just focus on you two?

14:21.061 --> 14:22.996
Tom, what's in your heart
right now?

14:23.030 --> 14:26.099
I don't think Tom really...
I guess it all started

14:26.133 --> 14:26.900
the day I was born.

14:26.934 --> 14:29.102
Uh, I was raised
by a cruel woman,

14:29.136 --> 14:30.337
I married a cruel woman,

14:30.370 --> 14:32.672
I get my dry cleaning done
by a cruel woman.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.574
(whistles)

14:36.977 --> 14:38.011
Meet Herbie.

14:38.045 --> 14:40.147
This little guy
isn't just adorable.

14:40.180 --> 14:44.051
He's also a hero, after alerting
his family to a house fire.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.386
Tragically, not everyone
made it out alive.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.388
Their nine-year-old son...

14:48.421 --> 14:50.423
(yawning)

14:52.425 --> 14:54.294
...lost his goldfish.

14:54.327 --> 14:55.963
RAY:
Damn, Nate!

14:55.996 --> 14:57.197
I thought you fixed this!

14:57.230 --> 14:59.032
I-I saw your therapist.
I'm trying.

14:59.066 --> 15:01.668
Do I need to pull up images
of helicopter crashes?

15:01.701 --> 15:03.336
I saw one
yesterday of a guy

15:03.370 --> 15:05.205
who lost just his lips.

15:05.238 --> 15:08.508
He's smiling, but I promise you,
he's not happy.

15:10.143 --> 15:13.480
But to be honest,
there's a reason

15:13.513 --> 15:17.484
she's the only person I trust
to have scissors near my eyes.

15:19.219 --> 15:22.055
That's lovely, Tom.

15:22.089 --> 15:24.091
Carol, you ready to dive in?

15:24.124 --> 15:25.525
Water's warm.

15:27.027 --> 15:30.097
Tom, I had no idea
you felt that way.

15:30.130 --> 15:32.165
And...

15:32.199 --> 15:36.069
I do want to be
friends, but I just...

15:36.103 --> 15:38.538
I just...

15:38.571 --> 15:39.973
I'm sorry, Doctor.

15:40.007 --> 15:42.009
I have something
I want to share, but...

15:42.042 --> 15:44.344
I don't feel comfortable
saying it in front of you.

15:44.377 --> 15:46.213
All right, all right,
that's cool, guys.

15:46.246 --> 15:47.347
Take your time.

15:47.380 --> 15:50.383
I'll just be right outside
working on my rock opera.

15:55.022 --> 15:56.223
What are you doing?

15:56.256 --> 15:57.490
I thought you were about
to tell me something.

15:57.524 --> 16:00.027
I'm telling you to shut up
and watch the door.

16:00.060 --> 16:00.994
Whatever Nathan's
been telling him

16:01.028 --> 16:03.096
has got to be
in this notebook somewhere.

16:03.130 --> 16:04.464
I thought
we were here for therapy.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.099
(chuckles):
Oh, please.

16:06.133 --> 16:07.600
Therapy is something
celebrities do

16:07.634 --> 16:10.437
to fill their days between
colonics and adultery. Ah.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.205
Here it is.

16:12.239 --> 16:14.174
"Nathan Miller."
Found him.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.644
Hey, man. Did we have
an appointment today?

16:17.677 --> 16:20.013
No. I was hoping that maybe
you could squeeze me in.

16:20.047 --> 16:22.549
Oh, actually, uh...

16:22.582 --> 16:25.185
I'm in the middle
of a couple's sesh right now.

16:25.218 --> 16:26.619
There's something
about me.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.288
More stuff about me.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.490
Come on, Nate. Enough
small talk about Mom.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.025
Let's get to the problem.

16:32.059 --> 16:35.295
Sure is a lot
about you in there.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.763
I'm his mother.
He loves me.

16:36.796 --> 16:39.132
Ah. Oh, here it is.

16:39.166 --> 16:42.135
His roommate is driving him...

16:42.169 --> 16:44.104
Never mind.

16:44.137 --> 16:47.307
Crazy? Is his roommate
driving him crazy?

16:47.340 --> 16:49.309
I used to have a roommate
that drove me crazy.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.244
Let's just get
out of here.

16:51.278 --> 16:54.281
Yeah, man, circle back in half
an hour, and we can fit you in.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.216
See...

17:00.287 --> 17:02.289
Zip me into a beanbag! Quick!

17:04.657 --> 17:06.259
What are you doing here?

17:06.293 --> 17:08.461
Oh! We're-we're...
we're going to therapy.

17:08.495 --> 17:09.529
Right, Tom?

17:09.562 --> 17:11.131
No.

17:11.164 --> 17:12.632
No, she tricked me
into coming here

17:12.665 --> 17:14.567
so she could read your
therapist's notes.

17:14.601 --> 17:17.070
Which she did
when he left the room.

17:19.839 --> 17:22.142
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

17:22.175 --> 17:24.144
Feels good to get things
off your chest.

17:24.177 --> 17:26.179
Carol, good luck.

17:26.213 --> 17:28.748
I'm gonna buy some goggles
and go to the barber shop.

17:31.218 --> 17:32.419
What is wrong with you?

17:32.452 --> 17:34.587
Me? You're the one
complaining about me

17:34.621 --> 17:36.489
to a stranger!

17:36.523 --> 17:38.758
Apparently, I'm all
"up in your biz."

17:38.791 --> 17:42.229
I asked you repeatedly to
change that to "business"!

17:44.464 --> 17:45.698
What's so wrong about a mother

17:45.732 --> 17:47.467
taking an interest
in her son's life?

17:47.500 --> 17:49.402
You have an opinion
about everything.

17:49.436 --> 17:51.438
What I'm wearing,
how I hang my toilet paper,

17:51.471 --> 17:53.506
what kind of dreams
I should have.

17:53.540 --> 17:55.275
I don't like
you falling all the time!

17:55.308 --> 17:56.276
It makes me nervous!

17:56.309 --> 17:58.711
And excuse me if I like
being helpful to my son.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.580
You never seemed
to mind the extra attention

18:00.613 --> 18:01.748
when you were younger.

18:01.781 --> 18:03.216
Well, of course not.

18:03.250 --> 18:04.851
I was a kid
who needed help to survive!

18:04.884 --> 18:07.454
But now I'm a grown man
who's supposed to be living

18:07.487 --> 18:09.289
on his own, but every
time I turn around,

18:09.322 --> 18:10.523
there you are
with that harsh,

18:10.557 --> 18:11.624
judging look.

18:12.525 --> 18:16.363
Yeah, that's the one.

18:16.396 --> 18:18.598
Most sons appreciate
having a mother in their lives.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.233
They don't hate it!

18:20.267 --> 18:21.401
I don't hate it.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.335
I just... I just
hate feeling like

18:22.369 --> 18:24.437
I always have
to put on a face for you.

18:24.471 --> 18:27.240
Oh, baloney. You don't have
to put on a face for me.

18:27.274 --> 18:28.875
I do, Mom. I do. I do.

18:28.908 --> 18:30.109
Otherwise,
all you're gonna see is

18:30.143 --> 18:33.446
a stressed out, 42-year-old
divorced dude with-with no kids

18:33.480 --> 18:36.349
and a career that's nowhere near
where he dreamed it would be.

18:36.383 --> 18:38.718
And I just... I don't want
to be that guy, because...

18:38.751 --> 18:40.820
because I know
that you worked so hard

18:40.853 --> 18:43.356
to put me through school
and to give me opportunities,

18:43.390 --> 18:46.459
and sometimes I feel
like I'm just...

18:46.493 --> 18:48.495
like I'm letting you down.

18:52.432 --> 18:54.567
(playing tune)

18:54.601 --> 18:56.769
Put that damn thing away!

18:58.905 --> 19:02.442
Nathan, never in a million years
would I have known

19:02.475 --> 19:04.577
you felt this way.

19:04.611 --> 19:07.480
Yeah, well,
it's... (sighs)

19:07.514 --> 19:09.349
It's kind of
news to me, too.

19:09.382 --> 19:12.685
It kills me to think you'd ever
feel ashamed around me.

19:14.521 --> 19:17.657
Every day you give me a reason
to be proud of you.

19:17.690 --> 19:19.692
You're a wonderful son.

19:20.927 --> 19:23.563
Local celebrity
on the news every night...

19:23.596 --> 19:25.598
Mom, stop it.

19:26.666 --> 19:29.569
Unless you had more.

19:29.602 --> 19:32.505
And handsome. So handsome.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.607
Plus, you had the courage

19:34.641 --> 19:37.410
to end a marriage
before it turned sour.

19:37.444 --> 19:39.779
You say I'm brave?

19:39.812 --> 19:42.349
You're the one who's brave.

19:42.382 --> 19:44.417
(chuckles)

19:44.451 --> 19:46.919
I guess I get
it from you.

19:48.555 --> 19:50.557
JOHNSON:
Wow.

19:50.590 --> 19:52.625
What a breakthrough.

19:52.659 --> 19:54.561
I guess someone's gonna be
yawning a lot less.

19:54.594 --> 19:57.564
So, Nathan,
I guess I'll see you

19:57.597 --> 19:59.832
Wednesday for our weekly
therapeutic jam sesh?

19:59.866 --> 20:01.668
I don't think so, Doc.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.436
You come near
my boy again,

20:03.470 --> 20:05.705
and I'll drown you
in Lake Iwannatalka.

20:15.748 --> 20:18.685
So after spending five days
on a raft without food or water,

20:18.718 --> 20:20.987
the captain and his crew
are now resting comfortably

20:21.020 --> 20:22.889
at an area hospital.

20:22.922 --> 20:24.557
Yeah.

20:24.591 --> 20:27.694
Way to not eat each other,
fellas.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.563
Thanks for choosing us for
your Saturday afternoon news.

20:30.597 --> 20:33.466
Stay tuned for an infomercial
about dehydrating fruit.

20:34.734 --> 20:35.968
He didn't yawn once.

20:36.002 --> 20:38.271
Can't believe
your father is missing this.

20:38.305 --> 20:40.273
Where did you say
he was again?

20:40.307 --> 20:41.441
Uh, I'm not sure.

20:41.474 --> 20:43.310
He said he wanted
to take Adam somewhere,

20:43.343 --> 20:44.977
but he was being
pretty secretive about it.

20:45.011 --> 20:46.513
Hmm.

20:46.546 --> 20:48.581
All right, I think
we're making some real progress.

20:48.615 --> 20:50.016
Let's take it again
from the top.

20:50.049 --> 20:53.653
* Oh, I accidentally
poked you in your eye *

20:53.686 --> 20:55.388
* Oh, did you "accidentally"

20:55.422 --> 20:57.624
* Poke me in my eye?

20:57.657 --> 20:59.426
* Perhaps I really meant
to poke you *

20:59.459 --> 21:01.060
* 'Cause you always
eat my cereal *

21:01.093 --> 21:03.896
* And I get stuck with
the last bagel which is rye *

21:03.930 --> 21:05.698
* And I hate rye.
(whistle blows)
