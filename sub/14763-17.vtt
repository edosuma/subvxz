I am T'Challa, king of

Most of you know me
as the Black Panther.

01:32.288 --> 01:34.741
The world is becoming
a smaller place,

01:34.841 --> 01:37.741
and it brings all peoples
closer together.

never been conquered.

04:46.565 --> 04:47.901
Plenty have tried, though.

04:48.018 --> 04:51.430
It's because of the Vibranium.

Maybe that's why the king
decided to swipe it.

05:01.258 --> 05:03.734
Black Panther asked me
if it was really my shield.

The way he asked,
he wasn't looking for an answer.

08:06.710 --> 08:08.796
The shield belongs to me.

08:08.991 --> 08:11.828
That's ridiculous.
Cap was frozen in ice

08:11.874 --> 08:14.031

before you were even born.

And it's got that delightful
red, white, and blue paint job.

He gave it to me.

08:50.507 --> 08:52.632
It was never his to give.

Howard Stark stole from
Wakanda to build that shield.

Hmm. There is a new unknown party

the precious Vibranium.

09:03.062 --> 09:07.015

all of our mines locked down.

Desperate enough
to send Crossbones after you.

09:14.218 --> 09:16.640
With you out of the way,
the country would drop into chaos,

09:16.686 --> 09:18.038

09:18.116 --> 09:20.509
Indeed. To draw out my foe,

09:20.555 --> 09:23.866
I needed an irresistible

I recognize you intended
that to be a compliment,

12:39.369 --> 12:40.753
but I find your comparison

12:40.799 --> 12:42.518
insulting to Wakandan technology.

12:42.564 --> 12:46.142
What? You can bad-mouth me,
but you trash-talk my tech,

12:46.267 --> 12:47.658
and we got a problem.

12:47.799 --> 12:50.721
It's fine, Tony.
Go check on the others.

12:50.877 --> 12:52.650
(CHUCKLING)  Tech.

12:52.821 --> 12:54.033
IRON MAN:  Unbelievable.

12:56.853 --> 12:59.228
You Avengers bicker and bark.

12:59.369 --> 13:01.057
Wild and out of control.

13:01.221 --> 13:03.721
Is it a wonder why I
would not work with you?

13:03.838 --> 13:06.924
I'm confident once you've worked
with us, your opinion will change.

13:07.103 --> 13:09.111
Just like I'm confident
when the time is right,

13:09.213 --> 13:10.822
you'll give me back my shield.

13:11.010 --> 13:13.088
That Vibranium was stolen.

13:13.314 --> 13:15.010
That Vibranium was given.

13:15.119 --> 13:17.392
By your father, King T'CHAKA.

13:17.635 --> 13:19.110
You knew my father?

13:19.203 --> 13:20.618
Howard Stark and I helped him

13:20.664 --> 13:22.649
stop the HYDRA invasion of Wakanda.

13:22.781 --> 13:25.664
In gratitude, he gifted
the Vibranium to Howard.

13:25.860 --> 13:27.641
I only met him the one time,

13:27.828 --> 13:30.997
but you can tell a lot about a person
if you listen and get to know them.

13:32.438 --> 13:34.423
My father was a great man,

13:34.571 --> 13:36.938
but he was too generous
and trusting.

13:37.110 --> 13:40.188
Maybe if he had been less so,
he would still be alive.

13:45.852 --> 13:50.945
So, Aneka, can the Dora Milaje
talk to us, or is...

13:50.991 --> 13:52.109
Do not distract me.

13:52.155 --> 13:55.444
I am not interested
in meaningless conversation.

13:55.702 --> 14:00.263
(CHUCKLES)  Uh, conversation with
me is never meaningless.

14:03.546 --> 14:05.905
Man! His Majesty, the Black Panther,

14:05.967 --> 14:08.297
doesn't have much of
a personality, does he?

14:08.343 --> 14:11.421
Yeah, I noticed.
We're not from Wakanda,

14:11.530 --> 14:13.047
so he doesn't have to be friendly.

14:13.093 --> 14:15.859
You misunderstand
the Black Panther's reticence.

14:15.976 --> 14:17.991
He is that way because he must be.

14:18.163 --> 14:21.210
As royalty, every action,
every decision he makes

14:21.320 --> 14:23.372
must be to protect his society.

14:23.421 --> 14:27.437
Since the thwarted HYDRA invasion
that nearly killed his father,

14:27.600 --> 14:30.403
King T'Challa has kept Wakanda closed.

14:30.554 --> 14:34.491
He defies his own rules by
even traveling with you like this.

14:34.584 --> 14:37.443
The past is the past.
Now we are working together,

14:37.498 --> 14:39.975
for that is the only way forward.

14:49.272 --> 14:50.639
(COMPUTER BEEPING)

14:50.842 --> 14:53.663
Finally, the last piece of the puzzle.

14:53.709 --> 14:55.021
CAPTAIN AMERICA:  Break it down.
Huh?

14:56.865 --> 14:59.029
Make it easy on yourself
and surrender.

14:59.131 --> 15:03.053
Why would I surrender
when I have the advantage?

15:03.113 --> 15:04.662
(DOOR CLOSES)

15:06.334 --> 15:08.975
KLAUE: When I last
fought you Avengers,

15:09.107 --> 15:12.221
my body was almost merged
with Vibranium.

15:12.267 --> 15:16.553
It was exhilarating,
but I needed more.

15:19.506 --> 15:22.865
My mind and body
needed an appropriate armor.

15:23.045 --> 15:26.491
Now I have one, made of Vibranium.

15:26.537 --> 15:30.239
Beautiful, indestructible Vibranium.

15:32.779 --> 15:36.224
I took this place to be my fortress.

15:36.286 --> 15:38.982
Now it'll be your tomb!

15:42.279 --> 15:44.630
(LOUD WHIRRING)

15:45.021 --> 15:47.802

HAWKEYE:  Hey, Klaue.

16:42.271 --> 16:44.552
You wanna talk about it?
Just ask her.

16:44.763 --> 16:47.560
I am great at conversation.

16:55.169 --> 16:56.740
You may have Vibranium,

16:56.826 --> 16:59.271
but nothing is completely invincible.

17:01.537 --> 17:03.165
Nothing except me!

(GRUNTS)

17:39.571 --> 17:40.977
I owe you thanks.

17:41.038 --> 17:43.005
Distracting Klaue saved my life

17:43.040 --> 17:44.172
and that of my king.

17:44.219 --> 17:47.547
Uh, you might get the chance
to return the favor real soon.

17:48.485 --> 17:49.844
Still alive?

17:49.930 --> 17:51.775
How disappointing.

17:51.829 --> 17:54.430
What's disappointing is your face, Klaue.

17:54.493 --> 17:57.352
(LAUGHS)  Was that loud enough to hear?

17:58.211 --> 18:00.625
I heard every word,

18:00.719 --> 18:04.333
and I'll hear your screams
as you perish!

18:07.998 --> 18:11.263
Courage and spirit.
You Avengers surprise me.

18:21.361 --> 18:22.693

18:28.357 --> 18:32.254
Whoooooa!  (GRUNTS)

18:32.687 --> 18:35.140
(CHUCKLES)  That was real soon.

18:35.312 --> 18:37.476
Returning the favor, Hawkeye.

IRON MAN:  Need a lift?

bicker and bark,

18:42.218 --> 18:44.133
you work well under pressure.

This is nothing. Stick with us, and
you'll see what we can really do.

18:53.664 --> 18:55.406
No way to avoid this one.

18:55.531 --> 18:57.297
No need to avoid this one.

18:57.437 --> 19:00.024
I have vanquished all manner
of monster and villain,

19:00.070 --> 19:01.984
but I have never fought an avalanche.

19:02.078 --> 19:03.390
Until now!

Klaue used

19:40.473 --> 19:42.016
to attack our sense
of balance,

19:42.062 --> 19:45.265
but I can't scan the right frequency
to jam Klaue himself.

19:45.398 --> 19:46.898
Then don't scan him,

19:46.984 --> 19:48.471
scan his Vibranium.

20:17.890 --> 20:19.161
(BODY THUDS)

20:19.312 --> 20:21.328
I will take that as a yes.

20:25.734 --> 20:29.047
This Vibranium belongs to your people.

20:29.297 --> 20:31.320
Hmm. The shield
once belonged here,

20:31.562 --> 20:34.734
but now it is better
in your deserving hands.

20:34.929 --> 20:37.922
My people would be proud
to have you wield it.

20:38.031 --> 20:40.553
And I think my father would too.

20:40.896 --> 20:44.615
So, Aneka,
you back on guard duty again?

20:44.701 --> 20:46.679
Actually, the king now believes

20:46.725 --> 20:48.506
we Dora Milaje can do more.

20:48.607 --> 20:50.663
He means to make me head
of special forces,

20:50.709 --> 20:52.990
or ambassador to Switzerland.

20:53.036 --> 20:54.287
One or the other.

Nonsense. You Avengers
must stay as our guests.

21:01.662 --> 21:04.396
Allow us to show you
Wakandan hospitality.

21:04.527 --> 21:06.684
Ho-ho-ho, hospitality.

21:06.739 --> 21:10.055
Does that mean we get to stay
overnight in your palace?

21:10.677 --> 21:12.755
(LAUGHS)
No.

21:12.903 --> 21:15.217
Outsiders do not sleep in the palace.

21:15.247 --> 21:16.903
But in your case,

21:17.052 --> 21:18.732
perhaps I will make an exception.

21:18.841 --> 21:22.528
Black Panther... Could you ever see
yourself joining the Avengers?
