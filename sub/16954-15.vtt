- There's my baby.
- Hello.

08:51.664 --> 08:54.133
{\an9}- Good to meet you.
Farrah. Hi.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.868
{\an8}- Farrah, how are you?

08:55.935 --> 08:57.837
{\an3}- You're like, "I want a hug,
not a handshake."

08:57.904 --> 08:59.305
{\an3}- I'm Simon.
Very nice to meet you.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.706
- Me too.
- Hi.

09:00.773 --> 09:01.774
- I love you.
- Good to see you.

09:01.841 --> 09:05.011
- I love that we could all
get together and meet.

09:05.077 --> 09:07.213
{\an8}So we're about to go
to the opera.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.749
{\an8}- Okay, cool.
- Six-hour affair.

09:09.815 --> 09:11.183
{\an8}- Make sure to bring
some coffee and wine.

09:11.250 --> 09:13.786
{\an8}- There you go.
[laughter]

09:13.853 --> 09:15.221
{\an8}- So how did you guys meet?

09:15.288 --> 09:17.590
{\an8}- On the Internet.
- Okay.

09:17.657 --> 09:18.858
{\an7}- I got to definitely
say, though, like,

09:18.925 --> 09:21.027
{\an7}I think you bring out
the best in Debra,

09:21.093 --> 09:22.895
{\an1}'cause she's, like, nice
and calm and, like, less tense.

09:22.962 --> 09:24.563
- No, I don't bring
the best out in her.

09:24.630 --> 09:26.699
She's always the best.

09:26.766 --> 09:28.000
{\an1}- Oh, there you go.
Oh, there you go. Touché.

09:28.067 --> 09:29.669
- She's under stress.
- Thank you.

09:29.735 --> 09:30.903
- She's under a lot of things.

09:30.970 --> 09:32.772
She's been through
a bunch of [bleep],

09:32.838 --> 09:35.274
{\an3}and then she gets
all this stuff thrown at her.

09:35.341 --> 09:36.776
I've watched "Teen Mom."

09:36.842 --> 09:38.678
And so what I see is, like--

09:38.744 --> 09:41.247
{\an3}it hurts, actually, me,
because I know her,

09:41.314 --> 09:43.249
and, like, uh, uh,

09:43.316 --> 09:47.053
{\an3}why are they doing that to her?
You know, beating her up.

09:47.119 --> 09:49.088
- What do you mean?
Regards to beating who up

09:49.155 --> 09:51.757
or what up
or down up or where--what?

09:51.824 --> 09:53.893
{\an3}- Just saying
negative things.

09:53.960 --> 09:56.195
- You know what? I'm not
in control of negativity.

09:56.262 --> 09:57.930
- No, no, no, you are,

09:57.997 --> 09:59.899
{\an3}because you're the one
that says it.

09:59.966 --> 10:03.803
- So if I am the issue,
then I would just...

10:03.869 --> 10:05.805
{\an3}- Just pause.
Just pause for a moment.

10:05.871 --> 10:07.106
- Not take things
out of context.

10:07.173 --> 10:09.942
{\an3}- Think about it,
because she loves you.

10:10.009 --> 10:11.877
- And I love my mom.
- And she--I know you do.

10:11.944 --> 10:14.914
- You do.
- She's trying to help you.

10:14.981 --> 10:16.615
{\an3}That's all.

10:16.682 --> 10:18.150
- God bless us all.
- Farrah, I mean,

10:18.217 --> 10:19.685
I'm just being honest.

10:19.752 --> 10:21.120
- Yeah, I'm all about
honesty.

10:21.187 --> 10:22.288
{\an3}- Do you want me
to tell you, honestly?

10:22.355 --> 10:23.289
- Sure.
- I'll tell you.

10:23.356 --> 10:24.857
I'll be honest, okay.

10:24.924 --> 10:28.060
- Okay, go for it.
- So, Simon and Farrah,

10:28.127 --> 10:29.729
the engagement ring--

10:29.795 --> 10:31.731
not a good thing.

10:31.797 --> 10:34.967
That's for a couple to choose,

10:35.034 --> 10:38.104
{\an3}not somebody to choose
for somebody else.

10:38.170 --> 10:39.839
{\an3}- You're bringing up
a lot of things

10:39.905 --> 10:42.108
{\an3}that will just
continue to upset me.

10:42.174 --> 10:44.210
- I'm not trying to hurt you.
- But I also know that Simon

10:44.276 --> 10:46.212
and I are only friends
right now, and you know what?

10:46.278 --> 10:47.813
Whatever guy I do marry,

10:47.880 --> 10:49.148
{\an3}that guy's gonna
definitely allow me

10:49.215 --> 10:51.350
{\an3}to pick something out
with my daughter.

10:51.417 --> 10:54.887
- That's fine. That's fine.
- I'm sorry, Farrah.

10:54.954 --> 10:56.022
{\an3}Farrah.

10:57.356 --> 10:59.892
{\an3}[groans]

10:59.959 --> 11:02.061
Farrah?
- It was good to meet you.

11:02.128 --> 11:03.796
- Farrah...

11:07.466 --> 11:08.934
{\an8}I do.

11:09.001 --> 11:11.437
- Yeah, so I know
what I want for my life,

11:11.504 --> 11:14.707
and you know what you want
for your personal life,

11:14.774 --> 11:16.342
and don't try to change me.

11:16.409 --> 11:17.710
- I'm not.
- Okay.

11:17.777 --> 11:19.779
- I'm not trying to change you.

11:23.416 --> 11:25.117
{\an9}- Have you heard anything else
about your dad?

11:25.184 --> 11:27.953
{\an1}- No, which is probably
not a good thing.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.990
I feel like it's a little, uh,

11:31.057 --> 11:34.427
it's a little much
for missing a parole, you know?

11:34.493 --> 11:35.828
I don't know, I feel like

11:35.895 --> 11:37.329
{\an1}there's something else
going on, so...

11:37.396 --> 11:39.131
{\an1}I have no idea where
they're transferring him to.

11:39.198 --> 11:40.800
{\an1}I don't know
if it's another jail.

11:40.866 --> 11:41.801
{\an1}Whenever he gets,
like, stationed

11:41.867 --> 11:43.903
or wherever he's at,
he'll be able to call

11:43.969 --> 11:45.237
{\an1}and let me know
what's going on, so...

11:45.304 --> 11:46.872
{\an3}- Hopefully we'll know
something

11:46.939 --> 11:48.407
{\an3}when we get back
from Maci's wedding.

11:48.474 --> 11:50.810
- Yeah, are you shocked?

11:50.876 --> 11:53.879
{\an3}- No, I'm not shocked.
I'm just disappointed in him.

11:53.946 --> 11:56.248
{\an1}- Yeah, I mean,
it is discouraging.

11:56.315 --> 11:57.983
{\an3}- Are you gonna help him
if you can,

11:58.050 --> 11:59.485
{\an3}like, get him out
or whatever?

11:59.552 --> 12:01.253
- Ain't nothing I can do.

12:01.320 --> 12:04.190
{\an1}They don't put bails
on parole violations, you know?

12:04.256 --> 12:05.357
- I wonder what even
made your dad think,

12:05.424 --> 12:06.892
like, "Oh," like, even,

12:06.959 --> 12:08.394
{\an3}forgot to go
to his parole meeting

12:08.461 --> 12:10.396
when he knew he only had
90 days left of parole.

12:10.463 --> 12:12.264
It makes no sense.

12:12.331 --> 12:15.101
{\an1}- I think he is afraid
of his own freedom.

12:15.167 --> 12:18.471
{\an1}This is the first year
that I felt pretty confident,

12:18.537 --> 12:20.005
{\an1}like, more than ever,
you know?

12:20.072 --> 12:21.740
- Yeah. Mm-hmm, I know.

12:21.807 --> 12:24.176
{\an1}- I think, like, subconsciously,
something's, like, off.

12:24.243 --> 12:25.177
Like, he doesn't know--
he doesn't realize it,

12:25.244 --> 12:27.947
but once he gets close--
- Maybe he gets anxious.

12:28.013 --> 12:30.082
- Like, that's
how dumb-asses work.

16:08.200 --> 16:09.535
- They're taking stuff away.

- They're giving me
my curves back.

16:11.470 --> 16:13.238
Everything's gonna be
a little bit tighter.

16:13.305 --> 16:15.207
- You're, like, shaping.
- It's like contouring.

16:15.274 --> 16:16.542
I'm not trying to, like,

16:16.608 --> 16:18.677

What does Matt think?
- He's--

16:27.386 --> 16:28.687

about the boobs,

boobs, he's gonna be like...

But, yeah, it's gonna be
a drastic difference.

16:37.496 --> 16:39.231

{\an1}she's too busy to talk,
and so she snaps.

and share some feelings
and thoughts. You know--

31:52.744 --> 31:54.379
{\an3}- Feelings and thoughts
about what?

31:54.445 --> 31:56.080
{\an1}- The same thing we're
talking about right here.

31:56.147 --> 31:57.248
- Uh, no, about Farrah.
- No.

31:57.315 --> 31:58.583

31:58.650 --> 32:00.551

32:00.618 --> 32:04.922
{\an1}- He just wanted to,
you know, mention that

32:04.989 --> 32:07.225
{\an1}if you fixed a little bit
of communication,

32:07.292 --> 32:10.495
just tweak it slightly,
you could be phenomenal.

32:10.561 --> 32:12.463
{\an3}- And, look, I don't
disagree with him,

32:12.530 --> 32:14.599
{\an3}but I think
the timing was horrific.

32:14.666 --> 32:16.501
- I told him that.
- Yeah.

32:16.567 --> 32:18.936
{\an3}Let's go back to the first part.
How did you put it,

32:19.003 --> 32:21.439
{\an3}that--it's kind of the way
she talks to you?

32:21.506 --> 32:23.441
You have a tendency

32:23.508 --> 32:26.944
{\an3}to speak to people in ways
that offends them.

32:27.011 --> 32:32.317
- Yes. I am so frustrated
at certain times.

32:32.383 --> 32:35.453
I literally feel like
every time I see my mom, uh--

32:35.520 --> 32:38.990
something I had to ask
just goes right out the window,

32:39.057 --> 32:40.558
and for these
next two months,

32:40.625 --> 32:42.727
I have to literally
be focused

32:42.794 --> 32:44.696
on what I need to do,
and my mom knows that.

32:44.762 --> 32:46.164
{\an3}- I want to talk about--
I want to talk

32:46.230 --> 32:47.498
about everything
you've taken on.

32:47.565 --> 32:50.268
Your fuse has got to be
really short right now.

32:50.335 --> 32:52.970
- But it's also
very hurtful to me

32:53.037 --> 32:56.974
when I'm allowing people
to help me--

32:57.041 --> 32:58.509
{\an3}- Allowing people
to help you?

32:58.576 --> 33:00.411
- 'Cause I'm in charge
of allowing people

33:00.478 --> 33:02.080
in and out of my life.

33:02.146 --> 33:03.748
- Well, yeah, but also,
are you paying your mom

33:03.815 --> 33:06.551
or is she just kind of
helping you as a mom?

33:06.617 --> 33:09.253
- Well, hopefully she's just
here to help me out as a mom.

33:09.320 --> 33:10.388
{\an3}- But then that's not
allowing someone.

33:10.455 --> 33:12.457
Then it's someone
doing you a favor.

33:12.523 --> 33:17.061
I'm gonna be blunt with you.
It comes across as entitled.

33:17.128 --> 33:20.064
- Okay.
- You guys both need to learn

33:20.131 --> 33:21.599
better communication skills.
- Yes.

33:21.666 --> 33:23.368
- You both need to learn
how to deescalate things.

33:23.434 --> 33:25.303
- I'm aware.
And I work on that.

33:25.370 --> 33:27.672
{\an3}- But I think you need
to work harder.

33:27.739 --> 33:29.574
This is complex,

33:29.640 --> 33:33.678
{\an3}and what this feels like to me
with your mom is a do-over.

33:33.745 --> 33:36.381
And I think you keep
inviting your mom in

33:36.447 --> 33:38.216
{\an3}to do these business
things with you

33:38.282 --> 33:41.119
{\an3}because you want
to pull her in

33:41.185 --> 33:44.155
because you weren't able
to pull her in as a kid,

33:44.222 --> 33:45.757
{\an3}and you wanted
her understanding,

33:45.823 --> 33:49.093
and you wanted her love.

33:49.160 --> 33:52.630
{\an1}- I'm not perfect.
None of us are.

33:52.697 --> 33:56.334
{\an1}But the differentiator
is love,

33:56.401 --> 33:58.336
{\an1}and you can get through it
because you know,

33:58.403 --> 34:01.539
{\an1}at the end of the day,
that you love each other.

34:01.606 --> 34:03.541

important.

36:19.010 --> 36:21.812
{\an3}so everybody could see it,
and so if--

36:21.879 --> 36:23.314
we can go ahead
and go with it.

36:23.381 --> 36:24.649
{\an9}Maci, do you want
to turn around?

36:24.715 --> 36:26.517
{\an8}- Do I need to sit?

<i>at your wedding.</i>

36:32.456 --> 36:34.425
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>we're pretty busy on the road</i>

36:34.492 --> 36:36.294
<i>and we have another gig,</i>

36:36.360 --> 36:37.895
<i>but we wanted to do</i>

36:37.962 --> 36:42.433

it's a challenge sometimes.

38:24.435 --> 38:28.439
[laughter]

38:28.506 --> 38:30.574
But none of us would be here
if we didn't love them,
