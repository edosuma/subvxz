00:50.843 --> 00:51.927
On your feet!

01:13.031 --> 01:14.241
An American, Colonel.

01:14.533 --> 01:16.535
He was at the gate,
impersonating an officer.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.209
You were alone?

01:25.836 --> 01:28.755
Spy, you were alone?

01:28.922 --> 01:30.340
I like to be alone.

01:31.717 --> 01:33.427
What did you come here for?

01:34.261 --> 01:36.722
You got a lot of nice stuff.

01:36.889 --> 01:38.223
Other people's stuff.

01:39.933 --> 01:42.019
"To the victor belongs the spoils."

01:43.270 --> 01:44.438
"To the victor"?

01:45.439 --> 01:46.940
Berlin's in rubble.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.734
The Führer's in hiding.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.695
You lost.

01:55.574 --> 01:57.034
Take him upstairs.

01:57.618 --> 01:58.452
What? What?

01:58.619 --> 01:59.578
Hey!

01:59.745 --> 02:00.829
Hey, wait a second. Guys!

02:00.996 --> 02:02.289
A moment. Please!

02:03.081 --> 02:04.583
Stop! I must speak to the commander.

02:04.875 --> 02:06.752
Colonel. I found it!

02:08.836 --> 02:10.214
Do as he says. Open it.

02:24.603 --> 02:26.605
The Lance of Longinus.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.442
The blade that drew Christ's blood.

02:31.318 --> 02:32.569
The Holy Lance.

02:42.871 --> 02:45.040
Double the guard.
This is the prize the Führer seeks.

02:45.207 --> 02:46.083
Colonel, we need to talk.

02:46.250 --> 02:47.417
No time, Doctor.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.044
The train to Berlin is waiting.

02:50.546 --> 02:51.296
Search the woods!

02:51.672 --> 02:52.381
Take the dogs.

02:53.549 --> 02:54.925
Do you think that spy was alone?

02:55.551 --> 02:57.052
Go! Go! Go! We're moving out!

02:57.344 --> 02:58.095
On the double!

03:24.162 --> 03:26.540
Looks like they're leaving without you guys.

03:27.833 --> 03:29.960
Tell us your story, or die.

03:30.752 --> 03:31.587
Story.

03:32.963 --> 03:34.798
Okay, okay.

03:34.965 --> 03:35.924
Well...

03:36.800 --> 03:38.302
it all started...

03:38.969 --> 03:43.056
once upon a time,
when this village...

03:43.223 --> 03:47.644
of stupid blue-eyed boys
decided to join hands together...

03:47.811 --> 03:51.106
and follow this sweaty little pied piper
named Adolf...

04:11.376 --> 04:12.252
No.

05:30.914 --> 05:33.000
This man was with the American.

05:34.751 --> 05:35.836
This is the American's bag.

05:37.713 --> 05:38.672
What have I done?

05:43.260 --> 05:44.595
Bring him to my carriage.

05:52.477 --> 05:55.272
Careful. This is the Führer's special relic!

06:24.843 --> 06:26.136
Stay seated.

06:27.012 --> 06:28.347
So...

06:31.225 --> 06:33.143
you are a birdwatcher?

06:36.813 --> 06:38.690
Yes. Because of the bombing,

06:38.982 --> 06:41.610
the wagtails are following
a completely different trajectory.

06:45.572 --> 06:47.282
We caught your accomplice.

06:48.492 --> 06:49.993
The American.

07:55.642 --> 07:56.560
Oh, my!

08:22.794 --> 08:24.004
Get off of me!

08:52.366 --> 08:54.952
There's one reason you're still alive,
birdwatcher.

08:57.621 --> 08:59.164
Who sent you?

08:59.331 --> 09:00.499
What was your mission?

09:00.666 --> 09:02.668
Please, Colonel, no. I beg you.

09:02.835 --> 09:05.128
My name is Basil Shaw.

09:06.380 --> 09:08.048
I'm a professor at Oxford.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.842
An archeologist.

09:17.432 --> 09:18.517
There you are.

09:22.604 --> 09:24.690
There is a problem.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.025
I must speak to the Colonel.

09:27.526 --> 09:29.319
It's urgent.

09:31.697 --> 09:33.615
I have a daughter. I beg you.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.952
I guarantee you will never see
your child again, Mr. Shaw.

09:40.289 --> 09:43.250
Unless you explain
why your accomplice had this.

10:05.814 --> 10:09.943
We were told that the Lance of Longinus
could be found at the fortress.

10:10.861 --> 10:11.737
We were looking for it.

10:12.779 --> 10:13.780
Why?

10:15.365 --> 10:16.408
Because of its power?

10:17.534 --> 10:20.245
It has no power.

10:22.873 --> 10:25.501
My friend and I were trying to save history.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.588
I must speak with the Colonel.

10:30.881 --> 10:31.924
It's about the Lance.

11:18.679 --> 11:20.055
I only had a moment to look at it.

11:20.264 --> 11:21.974
Of course, my training is in physics,

11:22.474 --> 11:24.434
For God's sake, spit it out!

11:26.520 --> 11:27.229
The Lance...

11:29.940 --> 11:31.650
It's a fake.

11:32.276 --> 11:33.068
It's a fake.

11:33.527 --> 11:34.653
A fake?

11:36.905 --> 11:38.448
The blade is an alloy.

11:38.615 --> 11:39.950
Fifty years old,

11:40.158 --> 11:42.286
the engravings recent. It's a replica.

11:42.494 --> 11:43.412
We're dead.

11:46.290 --> 11:48.542
Twelfth century. Thirteenth century.

11:49.293 --> 11:50.836
Ramesses II.

11:52.254 --> 11:53.964
None of this stuff is fake.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.385
I gotta stop this train.

11:58.719 --> 12:00.053
There is another relic on this train.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.639
One with real power.

12:03.098 --> 12:04.224
What are you talking about?

12:06.268 --> 12:07.186
The Antikythera.

12:07.895 --> 12:08.562
The Antikythera?!

12:08.812 --> 12:10.814
Enough about that old dial!

12:11.064 --> 12:13.233
Colonel, the Führer has lost the war...

12:13.650 --> 12:15.027
and his mind!

12:17.362 --> 12:18.572
Let me explain.

12:20.574 --> 12:23.035
The Antikythera's power is not supernatural.

12:23.493 --> 12:25.370
It is mathematics.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.582
Whoever harnesses it...

12:30.667 --> 12:32.169
will not be King...

12:32.920 --> 12:33.921
nor Emperor...

12:35.297 --> 12:36.507
or Führer.

12:40.010 --> 12:41.803
He will be God.

13:00.322 --> 13:01.865
Too many Nazis.

13:05.702 --> 13:08.330
And how do you propose we tell him this?

13:08.997 --> 13:09.706
My Führer,

13:10.374 --> 13:12.417
I'm sorry the Lance of Christ is fake.

13:12.668 --> 13:13.836
But here is...

13:15.254 --> 13:18.006
half of something you've never heard of.

13:19.550 --> 13:20.509
Tell me,

13:20.968 --> 13:22.469
have you ever MET HITLER?!!

13:25.055 --> 13:26.139
A saboteur aboard.

13:26.348 --> 13:27.641
And Hitler's Lance is gone.

14:09.016 --> 14:10.225
That way!

14:13.896 --> 14:15.189
What are you doing here?!

14:22.487 --> 14:23.322
What the hell?

14:24.823 --> 14:26.200
Indy?

14:26.366 --> 14:27.201
Baz?

14:27.701 --> 14:28.535
You're alive!

14:29.244 --> 14:30.245
So far.

14:31.121 --> 14:33.332
I thought I told you
to stay in the woods, Baz.

14:33.498 --> 14:37.586
What sort of a man hides in a hedge
while his friend is facing death?

14:50.766 --> 14:54.520
This lot are carting off
half the world's antiquities.

14:54.686 --> 14:57.731
I was gonna stop 'em,
but now I've gotta rescue you.

14:58.357 --> 14:59.816
Did you at least find the Lance?

15:00.234 --> 15:02.069
-"At least"?
-Well, have you got it?

15:02.569 --> 15:03.403
It's a fake.

15:03.570 --> 15:04.404
What?

15:05.113 --> 15:06.406
A reproduction.

15:09.243 --> 15:09.910
Who are you?

15:14.623 --> 15:15.499
Indy?

15:24.550 --> 15:25.843
The Antikythera.

15:27.010 --> 15:28.679
Archimedes' Dial.

15:30.222 --> 15:31.223
Bring it.

15:48.949 --> 15:50.075
Hurry up, Baz.

15:52.995 --> 15:54.371
Give me that.

15:54.538 --> 15:55.664
Come on.

16:10.304 --> 16:11.889
Get up, Baz.

16:12.055 --> 16:13.265
Follow me.

16:13.932 --> 16:15.225
Towards the gun?

16:15.392 --> 16:16.685
Away from the Nazis!

16:17.102 --> 16:19.062
Those are Nazis!

16:19.605 --> 16:21.607
Get down! Down! Down!

17:10.864 --> 17:12.031
This way. Come on!

17:12.699 --> 17:13.617
I can't do that!

17:13.784 --> 17:15.702
You wanna stop for a little lie-down?

17:19.498 --> 17:20.874
They have the Antikythera!

17:22.291 --> 17:23.292
Easy.

17:54.366 --> 17:55.200
Tunnel!

18:06.003 --> 18:07.546
Got you! No!

18:47.961 --> 18:49.213
Indy!

18:57.387 --> 18:58.472
Get the gun!

19:07.648 --> 19:09.066
Shoot him!

19:11.985 --> 19:13.070
Not me!

19:14.196 --> 19:15.197
Sorry.

19:34.508 --> 19:36.510
To the victor go the spoils.

20:07.499 --> 20:09.209
Drop the gun.

20:11.962 --> 20:13.505
Give me the Antikythera.

20:24.558 --> 20:25.976
Indy!

20:36.945 --> 20:37.779
Hey!

20:40.866 --> 20:43.202
-Here!
-They can't hear you, Baz.

20:43.744 --> 20:45.120
We gotta jump!

20:45.287 --> 20:46.622
What about my dicky knee?

20:53.587 --> 20:54.588
Baz!

20:55.506 --> 20:56.507
Baz!

20:58.342 --> 20:59.384
Baz!

21:00.719 --> 21:02.387
-Indy!
-Baz!

21:07.684 --> 21:09.186
Go! Move! Move it!

21:10.938 --> 21:13.815
Bit rum to go home empty-handed
after all that.

21:14.399 --> 21:15.609
"Empty-handed"?

21:15.776 --> 21:17.152
Not exactly.

21:19.905 --> 21:21.031
Archimedes' Dial.

21:21.198 --> 21:22.241
Well, half of it.

21:22.407 --> 21:24.618
Come on, Baz. Let's get home.

22:29.975 --> 22:32.603
Larry! Turn it down!

22:33.645 --> 22:34.897
Turn it down!

22:35.063 --> 22:36.899
Hey, Larry!

22:51.622 --> 22:52.623
Larry!

22:54.124 --> 22:55.000
Larry!

22:55.167 --> 22:56.752
-Hi, Mr. Jones.
-Where's Larry?

22:58.086 --> 22:58.795
Who is this guy?

22:58.962 --> 23:00.088
It's the old guy next door.

23:00.255 --> 23:01.882
Larry, it's 8:00 in the morning.

23:02.049 --> 23:04.426
-"It's 8:00 in the morning."
-We talked about this, Larry.

23:04.593 --> 23:05.552
Yeah, but that was...

23:05.719 --> 23:08.180
-a workday, Mr. Jones.
-This is a workday too, Larry!

23:09.556 --> 23:10.724
Turn on the news.

23:10.891 --> 23:12.267
It's moon day, Mr. Jones.

23:13.393 --> 23:14.603
Moon day?

24:07.990 --> 24:08.824
Thanks.

24:22.421 --> 24:24.256
All you really need to remember...

24:24.423 --> 24:28.010
is that Assyrian ceramics of this period
are characterized...

24:28.177 --> 24:32.139
by this complex blue-line pattern.

24:32.306 --> 24:33.307
Okay?

24:34.391 --> 24:37.769
I assigned pages 131 through 171...

24:37.936 --> 24:39.563
in Winford for today.

24:39.730 --> 24:41.231
Anybody do the reading?

24:43.692 --> 24:44.526
Anyone?

24:47.321 --> 24:49.364
Gosh, this is on the test.

24:49.531 --> 24:50.741
Okay.

24:51.950 --> 24:53.952
Guess I'll spoon-feed it to you.

24:56.830 --> 24:59.458
In 213 BC...

24:59.625 --> 25:01.627
Roman forces led by Marcellus...

25:01.793 --> 25:04.630
laid siege to the city of Syracuse.

25:04.796 --> 25:06.465
"Syracuse."

25:07.925 --> 25:10.511
Not the Syracuse in New York, Tonya.

25:10.677 --> 25:12.262
The one in Sicily.

25:13.055 --> 25:15.432
Amongst the defenders of the city...

25:15.599 --> 25:18.685
was its most famous resident, who was...

25:20.896 --> 25:22.606
Come on, guys. This is on the final.

25:23.315 --> 25:24.900
Archimedes.

25:25.776 --> 25:26.818
Archimedes.

25:26.985 --> 25:28.320
Archimedes, who was a...

25:28.487 --> 25:29.613
A mathematician.

25:29.780 --> 25:30.948
A mathematician.

25:31.114 --> 25:33.700
But more than that, an inventor...

25:33.867 --> 25:36.370
a brilliant engineer...

25:36.537 --> 25:40.874
who conceived of a way to harness the energy
of the Mediterranean sun...

25:41.041 --> 25:43.752
on concave mirrors and focus it...

25:43.919 --> 25:46.588
on attacking Roman warships
and set them on fire.

25:46.755 --> 25:50.217
Who devised giant iron claws...

25:50.384 --> 25:52.970
that could snatch hostiles from the sea.

25:55.556 --> 25:58.433
But how do we know it really happened?

25:59.560 --> 26:03.564
What physical, irrefutable
archeological evidence...

26:03.730 --> 26:07.067
-is there of these inventions?
-The Antikythera.

26:08.443 --> 26:10.612
-The Antikythera.
-For starters.

26:10.779 --> 26:12.781
They're here! They're downtown!

26:14.741 --> 26:16.076
The astronauts.

26:16.243 --> 26:18.579
Giant parade this morning will be seen...

26:18.745 --> 26:21.874
by about two and a half million people
lining the sidewalks...

26:24.918 --> 26:26.336
He's coming. He's come. See?

26:26.503 --> 26:27.921
Oh, here he comes.

26:28.964 --> 26:29.882
Hide the cake.

26:31.592 --> 26:33.677
-Surprise.
-Surprise!

26:37.806 --> 26:38.974
For over a decade now...

26:39.141 --> 26:43.645
our colleague Dr. Jones has been
a loyal servant of Hunter.

26:45.063 --> 26:46.648
A token of our gratitude.

26:53.989 --> 26:54.907
Wow.

26:59.328 --> 27:01.246
Thanks for putting up with me.

27:15.636 --> 27:16.470
Here.

27:25.187 --> 27:28.232
Astronauts Neil Armstrong, Mike Collins,
and Buzz Aldrin...

27:28.398 --> 27:30.359
will not be able to avoid the spotlight.

27:30.526 --> 27:34.238
At 11:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time,
a grateful nation will pay homage...

27:34.404 --> 27:37.032
with a ticker-tape parade
through New York and Chicago...

27:37.199 --> 27:38.700
climaxed by a dinner in Los Angeles...

27:38.867 --> 27:40.202
What would the ancients say?

27:40.661 --> 27:42.454
Neil, Buzz, and Mike...

27:42.621 --> 27:45.374
If they knew we walked on the moon?

27:45.541 --> 27:47.084
Speaking as an ancient...

27:47.251 --> 27:49.711
going to the moon is like going to Reno.

27:49.878 --> 27:51.171
Middle of nowhere...

27:52.381 --> 27:53.841
and no blackjack.

27:54.883 --> 27:56.510
You don't recognize me, do you?

27:58.846 --> 28:00.889
Whatever I did, I apologize.

28:01.849 --> 28:02.891
It's Helena.

28:04.476 --> 28:05.519
Helena Shaw.

28:07.396 --> 28:08.564
Wombat?

28:08.730 --> 28:10.399
Wow, I haven't heard that in a while.

28:11.066 --> 28:12.651
-You got tall.
-I did.

28:12.818 --> 28:14.111
It's fair to say.

28:16.238 --> 28:17.322
I'm celebrating.

28:18.448 --> 28:20.659
-I'm retiring.
-Oh.

28:21.159 --> 28:22.661
Wow.
Well, in that case, what are we drinking?

28:28.083 --> 28:29.835
Room service for Mr. Schmidt.

28:42.347 --> 28:43.307
Put that away.

28:43.473 --> 28:45.309
I was asking how you broke your ankle.

28:46.101 --> 28:47.019
None of your business.

28:47.186 --> 28:48.103
Are you Mr. Schmidt?

28:48.270 --> 28:50.397
"Doctor" Schmidt. He's in there.

28:50.564 --> 28:53.358
And he don't eat anything on wheels,
so put it on a table.

28:54.818 --> 28:56.111
When I was a little boy...

28:56.612 --> 28:57.779
I always imagined...

28:57.946 --> 29:01.658
that one day man would walk on the moon.

29:02.201 --> 29:03.327
And by golly...

29:09.958 --> 29:11.668
Quite a celebration out there.

29:15.088 --> 29:16.548
The man you're servin'...

29:16.715 --> 29:19.009
he's the one who put those astronauts
on the moon.

29:19.176 --> 29:20.219
Built the rockets they rode in.

29:21.637 --> 29:22.888
Congratulations.

29:23.347 --> 29:24.181
Where are you from?

29:25.265 --> 29:26.058
The Bronx, sir.

29:26.225 --> 29:28.185
No, no. I mean originally, your people.

29:28.352 --> 29:29.353
Do you know?

29:33.982 --> 29:35.692
I was born by Yankee Stadium, sir.

29:38.278 --> 29:40.113
And you fought for your country?

29:41.073 --> 29:42.491
320th Battalion.

29:42.658 --> 29:45.035
Set up balloons to stop the planes
bombing Normandy.

29:50.541 --> 29:52.376
And are you enjoying your victory?

30:00.259 --> 30:01.260
Will there be anything else?

30:03.804 --> 30:05.013
You didn't win the war.

30:06.682 --> 30:07.808
Hitler lost it.

30:13.438 --> 30:14.273
Yeah.

30:15.566 --> 30:18.235
My field agent, she found Shaw.

30:19.236 --> 30:20.445
Yeah, I'm comin'.

30:20.612 --> 30:21.613
Let's go, Hauke.

30:24.950 --> 30:26.201
Where are we here?

30:27.286 --> 30:29.204
Oxford. In the garden.

30:31.081 --> 30:32.374
He was an original.

30:34.793 --> 30:36.211
I just graduated.

30:36.378 --> 30:37.379
In Archeology.

30:38.338 --> 30:40.465
Archeology. Wow.

30:40.632 --> 30:42.176
Apple didn't fall far.

30:42.342 --> 30:45.053
Well, now I'm researching a doctorate.

30:46.263 --> 30:47.264
What's your subject?

30:48.056 --> 30:50.058
The Archimedes Dial.

30:50.726 --> 30:52.144
The Antikythera.

30:55.105 --> 30:56.440
What do you know about that?

30:56.982 --> 30:58.317
Well, for starters...

30:58.483 --> 31:01.862
in 1902, Greek sponge divers found
a wrecked Roman warship...

31:02.029 --> 31:03.405
huge, off the coast of Greece.

31:04.031 --> 31:05.741
Below deck, sealed in wax...

31:05.908 --> 31:07.451
was a clock-like mechanism...

31:07.618 --> 31:10.412
finely tooled, purpose unknown.

31:10.579 --> 31:14.541
Nothing approximating its complexity appears
in the world for 1,000 years.

31:15.709 --> 31:17.836
-You've done your homework.
-Well, not me.

31:18.003 --> 31:21.006
Dad. He had all these journals,
reams of notes about it.

31:21.173 --> 31:23.008
He was obsessed till the end.

31:26.678 --> 31:28.847
He told me you found it
on a Nazi plunder train.

31:30.307 --> 31:33.393
And then lost it in a river
in the French Alps.

31:36.188 --> 31:37.356
Well, that was a long time ago.

31:37.523 --> 31:38.982
And it was only half the Dial.

31:39.149 --> 31:40.692
-Archimedes...
-Archimedes broke the Dial in two...

31:40.859 --> 31:41.818
-...disassembled it.
-...and then hid...

31:41.985 --> 31:43.987
the two halves from the Romans
during the siege of Syracuse.

31:44.154 --> 31:45.364
I know. Look.

31:46.532 --> 31:48.367
You don't remember the last time I saw you,
do you?

31:49.993 --> 31:51.119
Remember what?

31:51.286 --> 31:52.204
These are the Alps.

31:53.664 --> 31:55.249
Yeah, I see.

31:55.415 --> 31:57.251
And this is the route that your train took...

31:57.417 --> 31:59.378
-from the Nazi stronghold in '44.
-Right.

31:59.545 --> 32:01.338
It went through this mountain pass...

32:01.505 --> 32:03.006
and then here.

32:03.173 --> 32:05.384
-Here, it's the only river on the route.
-Right.

32:05.551 --> 32:06.635
Under a bridge.

32:06.802 --> 32:08.178
It's down there. It's got to be.

32:08.345 --> 32:10.764
-And nobody knows except us.
-"Us"?

32:11.056 --> 32:12.558
Well, I mean, you.

32:12.724 --> 32:14.268
And me. So, yeah.

32:14.434 --> 32:16.270
-Us.
-Us.

32:17.271 --> 32:19.773
And what were you thinking exactly?

32:21.233 --> 32:22.317
Well, that maybe...

32:24.152 --> 32:25.696
we could go there.

32:25.863 --> 32:26.905
And?

32:27.072 --> 32:28.156
And find it.

32:29.074 --> 32:30.701
And I'd become...

32:32.327 --> 32:33.495
famous.

32:33.662 --> 32:34.955
Oh, well, not famous.

32:35.122 --> 32:35.956
Renowned. Feted.

32:36.540 --> 32:38.333
A feted archeologist.

32:38.500 --> 32:40.252
And you, a final triumph!

32:40.419 --> 32:41.336
Indiana Jones!

32:41.503 --> 32:43.547
Out with a bang! Back in the saddle!

32:46.592 --> 32:48.010
I'm not selling this, am I?

32:50.512 --> 32:51.722
Wombat...

32:53.849 --> 32:55.684
why are you chasing the thing...

32:57.436 --> 32:59.521
that drove your father crazy?

33:05.485 --> 33:06.904
Wouldn't you?

33:25.255 --> 33:26.089
I got it.

33:26.256 --> 33:27.216
Parade's comin' soon.

33:28.425 --> 33:29.259
So, what we got?

33:31.011 --> 33:33.388
She's in there, third floor, with an old guy.

33:33.555 --> 33:34.681
Who is he, a Russian?

33:34.848 --> 33:36.767
No, a professor. Dr. Henry Jones.

33:38.018 --> 33:38.852
Klaber!

33:39.353 --> 33:41.438
Klaber, get back here! You're not an agent!

33:41.605 --> 33:42.898
Goddammit!
Go.

33:43.065 --> 33:45.651
I'll get support up here
and pull a file on Jones.

34:06.296 --> 34:07.548
This way.

34:43.708 --> 34:46.795
Basil became obsessed by this German theory.

34:48.338 --> 34:49.715
Conjecture, really.

34:52.259 --> 34:54.553
Archimedes had figured out...

34:54.719 --> 34:56.972
that the movements of the moon and planets...

34:57.848 --> 34:59.057
weren't perfect.

35:00.309 --> 35:02.811
There were irregularities in their rotations.

35:03.979 --> 35:06.273
He thought these irregularities might...

35:06.440 --> 35:09.818
explain fluctuations in temperature, tides.

35:11.945 --> 35:13.238
Storms, even.

35:14.615 --> 35:17.492
So, he set about building a device
to predict them.

35:19.203 --> 35:23.123
But then, he stumbled upon a method
to predict even larger...

35:23.874 --> 35:24.875
disturbances.

35:26.752 --> 35:28.170
Larger disturbances?

35:28.795 --> 35:31.006
Your father thought this thing could...

35:31.715 --> 35:33.967
predict fissures in time.

35:50.984 --> 35:52.486
Hauke, if you don't...

35:54.905 --> 35:55.989
Found 'em.

36:04.665 --> 36:05.582
Hello.

36:06.792 --> 36:09.002
Are you looking for...

36:09.169 --> 36:10.337
Dr. Jones?

36:14.007 --> 36:15.259
Excuse me, can I help you?

36:15.884 --> 36:16.760
No, thank you.

36:16.927 --> 36:18.637
Just a routine investigation, ma'am.

36:19.721 --> 36:22.224
Are you the police?

36:22.391 --> 36:23.725
It'll just be a few moments.

36:23.892 --> 36:25.727
-Professor Plimpton.
-Ma'am.

36:25.894 --> 36:27.020
-Professor Plimpton!
-Ma'am!

36:31.567 --> 36:32.401
Drop your weapon.

36:32.776 --> 36:33.777
What the hell are you doin'?

36:35.070 --> 36:37.155
What the doctor tells me, Miss Mason.

36:37.322 --> 36:38.198
Mandy?

36:42.953 --> 36:44.997
Yeah, no witnesses.

36:49.376 --> 36:51.461
Jesus. What the hell?

36:51.753 --> 36:55.048
Your father wrote so many letters
about the Dial, I stopped reading 'em.

36:58.177 --> 37:00.888
You really don't remember the last time
I was at your house?

37:02.848 --> 37:04.725
I took that from him then.

37:06.351 --> 37:08.061
I thought he'd stopped thinking about it.

37:08.228 --> 37:12.107
But your father was convinced this thing
was real and dangerous.

37:12.274 --> 37:14.234
Do not shoot.

37:14.651 --> 37:18.071
He was terrified that if somebody found
this legendary tablet,

37:18.238 --> 37:19.364
the Grafikos...

37:19.531 --> 37:21.700
The tablet containing directions
to the rest of the Dial.

37:21.867 --> 37:22.993
And if they found the Grafikos...

37:23.160 --> 37:24.703
they might acquire the other half
of the Dial...

37:24.870 --> 37:25.704
and put the two together.

37:27.372 --> 37:28.582
I knew you wouldn't destroy it.

37:32.211 --> 37:34.046
How did you know he asked me to destroy it?

37:34.546 --> 37:35.380
What?

37:35.547 --> 37:36.924
You do remember that night.

37:38.342 --> 37:41.094
-I was 12 years old, Indy.
-You knew we didn't drop it in a river.

37:41.929 --> 37:43.013
Baz didn't tell you that.

37:43.180 --> 37:45.182
-See, listen. I didn't...
-No, he never lied.

37:45.724 --> 37:48.101
-No. You...
-What was all that crap about the map?

37:48.268 --> 37:49.311
No, you've had too many whiskeys.

37:50.187 --> 37:51.104
What are you doing, Wombat?

37:51.271 --> 37:52.439
Stay where you are.

37:53.982 --> 37:54.816
Don't move.

37:55.567 --> 37:57.027
-Who are these people?
-We need to get out of here.

37:57.194 --> 37:58.028
Are they with you?

37:58.195 --> 37:59.363
Not an inch, Miss Shaw.

38:00.697 --> 38:01.698
Miss Shaw, stop!

38:05.077 --> 38:05.911
Helena!

38:11.333 --> 38:12.167
Stop!

38:14.127 --> 38:15.170
Sorry.

38:15.337 --> 38:16.129
Helena!

38:16.296 --> 38:18.173
Dr. Jones. It's over.

38:18.340 --> 38:19.550
Who are you people?

38:19.716 --> 38:20.801
What do you want?

38:22.803 --> 38:23.637
Stop!

38:25.806 --> 38:26.640
Helena Shaw!

38:26.807 --> 38:28.058
She's on the roof. Find another way up.

38:28.225 --> 38:29.059
Dr. Jones!

38:29.893 --> 38:31.270
Dr. Jones, we're not gonna hurt you.

38:57.796 --> 39:00.299
-Move. We gotta follow 'em.
-Go. Hurry up.

39:27.868 --> 39:28.702
Fan out!

39:41.882 --> 39:44.259
-All right, let's go. Move, move, move! Pack it up!
-Come on. Get everything.

39:44.426 --> 39:45.552
Found her!

40:13.997 --> 40:16.291
-Operator.
-I need the police.

40:16.458 --> 40:18.752
Hunter College. People are dead.

40:18.919 --> 40:20.003
-Please...
-Hang up, fella.

40:25.884 --> 40:26.802
Stand up.

40:32.432 --> 40:33.392
Okay, okay.

40:57.875 --> 40:59.334
She's gone. You blew it...

40:59.501 --> 41:00.752
you trigger-happy cracker.

41:00.919 --> 41:03.380
-She had it in her hand.
-We got the professor.

41:06.967 --> 41:08.135
Here's the file on Jones.

41:08.302 --> 41:09.219
Yes.

41:27.487 --> 41:28.530
Who are you?

41:28.697 --> 41:30.157
That's my question.

41:40.667 --> 41:42.127
You're CIA.

41:42.294 --> 41:44.046
Oh, not me, man.

41:44.213 --> 41:46.173
I don't take government jobs.

41:46.340 --> 41:47.174
Okay.

41:48.717 --> 41:50.886
How are you acquainted with Miss Shaw?

41:51.261 --> 41:52.513
She's my goddaughter.

41:53.263 --> 41:54.890
I haven't seen her in 18 years.

41:55.057 --> 41:57.226
Why did you meet with her today?
To give her the Dial?

41:58.602 --> 42:01.063
Lady, it's an ancient hunk of gears.

42:02.022 --> 42:02.981
Half a hunk.

42:03.148 --> 42:04.858
Oh, it's a lot more than that.

42:06.568 --> 42:07.653
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

42:07.819 --> 42:09.071
Where do you think you're going?

42:09.238 --> 42:10.614
I got a parade going on.

42:10.781 --> 42:12.241
And a demonstration coming down here.

42:12.407 --> 42:13.450
Hey! Hey, hey!

42:14.117 --> 42:15.160
-Hey...
-Shut up.

42:15.327 --> 42:17.746
I can't go this way. Gotta go back.

42:22.751 --> 42:24.503
Hell no! What is wrong with you, man?

42:24.670 --> 42:26.296
Damn it!
Let's go on foot.

42:26.463 --> 42:27.297
You heard her.

42:29.341 --> 42:30.217
What the hell were you thinking?

42:30.384 --> 42:31.677
-Walk! Come on.
-What is your problem?

42:31.844 --> 42:33.345
-You don't look when you're backin' up?
-Take care of that guy.

42:33.512 --> 42:34.304
Who's gonna pay for that?

42:34.471 --> 42:35.639
Easy, fella. Easy.

42:35.806 --> 42:36.557
Keep movin'.

42:36.723 --> 42:38.433
Can't you see my cab? It's yellow.

42:38.600 --> 42:40.602
No, you're gonna have to pay
for this bodywork, man. I don't...

42:43.146 --> 42:45.440
Peace now! Peace now!

42:46.859 --> 42:49.695
Stop the war! Stop the fighting!

42:49.862 --> 42:51.613
-Where are we going, Mason?
-This way.

42:53.657 --> 42:55.242
-Hell no, we won't go.
-Shut up.

42:55.409 --> 42:56.827
-Hell no, we won't go!
-Hell no!

42:57.160 --> 42:59.746
-Hell no, we won't go!
-Hell no, we won't go!

42:59.913 --> 43:00.789
We won't go!

43:00.956 --> 43:03.333
-Hell no, we won't go!
-Hell no, we won't go!

43:03.917 --> 43:05.335
-Hell no...
-Shut up!

43:05.669 --> 43:06.503
Hell yeah!

43:16.555 --> 43:17.556
Hell no...

43:28.483 --> 43:29.318
Hey!

43:30.235 --> 43:32.237
Officer! Help me!

43:32.988 --> 43:34.489
Officer, there was a shooting...

43:34.656 --> 43:36.491
-All right, all right.
-...this morning at Hunter.

43:36.658 --> 43:38.410
People are dead. God damn it.

43:38.577 --> 43:41.914
-Some rogue maniacs broke in and...
-Sir, you need to calm it down.

43:42.080 --> 43:43.290
Please listen to me.

43:43.457 --> 43:45.584
There was a shooting this morning, and the...

43:45.751 --> 43:49.171
They're in a Con Ed van
right around the corner!

43:51.757 --> 43:53.383
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

44:05.562 --> 44:06.897
-Watch out!
-What's he doin'?

44:27.709 --> 44:28.794
You did it!

44:56.113 --> 44:57.114
Move, out the way!

45:05.289 --> 45:06.123
Watch out!

45:08.458 --> 45:09.626
Move! Quickly!

45:24.391 --> 45:25.309
Move! Move!

45:35.903 --> 45:37.279
Go, go, go!

45:57.883 --> 46:00.552
Come on. That's ridiculous. It's a horse.

46:00.719 --> 46:01.553
Come on!

46:04.056 --> 46:05.891
-Hey, mister.
-Move! Out of the way!

46:06.225 --> 46:07.059
Hold my horse.

46:07.226 --> 46:08.352
Move! Move!

46:08.519 --> 46:11.230
Transfer is available
for IND Queens Boulevard.

46:20.697 --> 46:23.700
Next stop, 59th, Lexington Avenue.

46:25.577 --> 46:26.828
Subway is faster.

46:28.372 --> 46:32.167
People tend to romanticize science,
when it is, in fact, quite cold.

46:32.334 --> 46:33.836
So, what's next, Dr. Schmidt?

46:34.962 --> 46:35.879
Mars?

46:36.839 --> 46:38.257
No, we've conquered space.

46:40.092 --> 46:41.802
I'm moving to the next frontier.

46:43.262 --> 46:45.681
What's beyond space?

46:49.309 --> 46:52.312
You might wanna get that suit pressed,
Dr. Schmidt.

46:52.938 --> 46:54.565
We leave for the airport in an hour.

46:54.940 --> 46:56.024
He's gonna meet the President.

46:56.191 --> 46:57.693
If the President objects to a few creases...

46:57.860 --> 47:00.112
perhaps he should find himself
another physicist.

47:01.113 --> 47:02.948
-Can I use that?
-No.

47:03.323 --> 47:04.157
Yes.

47:05.909 --> 47:06.743
Baxter.

47:10.706 --> 47:11.832
It's for you, Doctor.

47:15.586 --> 47:17.629
I may wanna leave a bit later
for Los Angeles.

47:17.796 --> 47:20.048
I'm expecting a delivery shortly.

47:23.302 --> 47:24.136
Speak.

47:24.303 --> 47:25.804
Your goons made a mess.

47:25.971 --> 47:27.139
Did they?

47:27.306 --> 47:29.725
Miss Shaw met with a professor. Jones.

47:30.350 --> 47:32.102
She acquired the device from him.

47:33.020 --> 47:34.104
Then we lost her.

47:35.772 --> 47:37.441
Dr. Jones got away as well.

47:37.858 --> 47:39.026
Is that so?

47:39.193 --> 47:40.527
Most unfortunate.

47:40.903 --> 47:42.487
I gotta clean things up here, Doctor.

47:42.654 --> 47:44.907
And as a representative
of the United States government...

47:45.073 --> 47:46.783
I urge you to cooperate.

47:46.950 --> 47:48.160
Get on that plane to Los Angeles...

47:49.077 --> 47:50.329
and get your medal from the President.

47:57.961 --> 47:58.795
Hello?

47:59.546 --> 48:01.715
Call our friends
and secure a private charter.

48:03.133 --> 48:04.051
To Morocco.

48:04.218 --> 48:05.385
Yes, sir.

48:06.303 --> 48:09.515
The university murders took place
at the height of the parade.

48:09.681 --> 48:13.101
Police are searching for retired professor
Dr. Henry Jones.

48:13.268 --> 48:16.271
A colleague told ABC
that Jones recently lost his son...

48:16.438 --> 48:18.440
and was in the middle of a divorce.

48:21.151 --> 48:23.862
This guy, he looks like you.

48:24.821 --> 48:27.199
Nah. No.

48:29.159 --> 48:30.160
It is you.

48:30.327 --> 48:31.161
No, no, no. Hey.

48:31.328 --> 48:32.829
-Go home, pal. You're drunk.
-This is the guy!

48:32.996 --> 48:34.289
-Hey!
-It's the killer!

48:36.959 --> 48:38.377
Sorry I'm late, Indy.

48:38.544 --> 48:39.962
Bridge traffic.

48:50.848 --> 48:53.016
Boy, am I glad to see you, Sallah.

48:53.851 --> 48:55.853
I wish I could say the same, old friend.

48:59.147 --> 49:01.066
Quickly, Indy. Inside.

49:04.862 --> 49:07.155
Your goddaughter, Helena...

49:07.322 --> 49:09.992
was arrested in Tangier last year...

49:10.909 --> 49:12.911
for auctioning contraband.

49:15.372 --> 49:16.331
There's more.

49:17.499 --> 49:20.919
She was bailed out by Aziz Rahim.

49:21.670 --> 49:24.506
Aziz Rahim is the son of Big Rahim...

49:24.673 --> 49:27.426
a well-known Moroccan mobster.

49:28.969 --> 49:32.639
Big Rahim owns the Hotel Atlantique...

49:32.806 --> 49:35.392
in Tangier, and this week...

49:35.559 --> 49:39.688
the hotel is hosting its annual auction...

49:39.855 --> 49:41.732
of stolen antiquities.

49:42.900 --> 49:45.402
All the big players are already there.

49:45.569 --> 49:47.362
Alia, Jabari.

49:47.529 --> 49:51.700
This is the great man who brought our family
to America during the war.

49:51.867 --> 49:54.244
Quick, when was the Suez Crisis?

49:55.120 --> 49:56.788
1956.

49:57.247 --> 49:58.624
Very impressive, Jabari.

49:58.790 --> 50:01.210
My grandchildren watch too much TV...

50:01.376 --> 50:03.921
but they know their history.

50:04.087 --> 50:08.217
They understand what it is
to be American and Egyptian.

50:09.092 --> 50:11.261
I need a ride to the airport, Sallah.

50:12.346 --> 50:14.848
If you run, the police will assume
that you're guilty.

50:15.557 --> 50:18.894
Without Helena or the Dial,
I'm gonna get framed for murder.

50:20.062 --> 50:21.688
Have you thought about calling Marion?

50:22.773 --> 50:24.107
She doesn't wanna talk to me.

50:30.280 --> 50:33.867
Welcome to New York's John F. Kennedy
International Airport.

50:34.701 --> 50:36.995
The upper level is for Pan American Airlines
passenger drop off only.

50:37.162 --> 50:38.997
I took something else from your apartment.

50:39.164 --> 50:40.374
It was under the bed.

50:45.587 --> 50:46.630
Thanks, Sallah.

50:48.882 --> 50:50.676
I also brought my passport.

50:52.719 --> 50:53.929
I could help you.

50:54.096 --> 50:55.013
In Tangier?

50:55.180 --> 50:56.807
Wherever chance takes us.

50:57.724 --> 50:58.809
Indy, I...

50:59.726 --> 51:01.186
I miss the desert.

51:01.770 --> 51:03.063
I miss the sea.

51:04.606 --> 51:06.400
And I miss waking up every morning...

51:06.567 --> 51:09.695
wondering what wonderful adventure
the new day will bring to us.

51:10.654 --> 51:12.656
This is not an adventure, Sallah.

51:14.116 --> 51:16.702
Those days have come and gone.

51:16.869 --> 51:17.911
Perhaps.

51:18.078 --> 51:19.413
Perhaps not.

51:23.876 --> 51:26.503
Give 'em hell, Indiana Jones!

51:38.098 --> 51:38.974
Champagne?

51:39.558 --> 51:41.435
We've got four more hours to Tangier.

51:49.193 --> 51:50.611
Your scotch, sir.

51:51.236 --> 51:52.237
Thanks.

51:59.161 --> 52:00.537
Basil. Come on, Baz!

52:00.704 --> 52:02.456
-Open the door!
-No!

52:02.623 --> 52:04.124
-Stay out, Indy!
-Open the door.

52:07.336 --> 52:09.213
The Germans were right, Indy.

52:09.880 --> 52:11.673
-What?
-It's too big. It's too much.

52:11.840 --> 52:12.674
Hey, Ba...
Hey, hey!

52:12.841 --> 52:14.635
-Hey, Baz! Give me...
-No.

52:14.801 --> 52:16.887
-What are you doing?
-You've listened to nothing that I said.

52:17.054 --> 52:18.847
I don't understand it, Baz!

52:19.181 --> 52:21.141
Well, I was trying to explain it
to you downstairs.

52:21.308 --> 52:23.602
-You've just ignored everything.
-You're terrifying your daughter.

52:25.771 --> 52:27.856
Indy, Archimedes...

52:28.023 --> 52:30.234
discovered a temporal meteorology.

52:30.442 --> 52:33.070
Archimedes was a mathematician, Baz...

52:33.237 --> 52:34.446
not a magician.

52:34.613 --> 52:37.074
He could predict fissures in time.

52:37.241 --> 52:38.784
Fissures in time?

52:39.159 --> 52:42.204
-Baz, you can't prove that!
-Well, not yet.

52:42.371 --> 52:44.248
Proving it is what makes it science!

52:59.513 --> 53:00.722
Oh, Baz.

53:02.432 --> 53:03.976
I never should've given you the thing.

53:04.685 --> 53:06.186
It belongs in a museum.

53:07.104 --> 53:08.814
Give it to me. Please.

53:12.401 --> 53:13.777
If I give you this...

53:14.987 --> 53:16.446
it must be destroyed.

53:17.948 --> 53:18.824
I will.

53:21.660 --> 53:23.078
I'll destroy it, Baz.

53:25.581 --> 53:26.582
Promise.

53:32.713 --> 53:34.214
I'm sorry about this.

53:34.381 --> 53:35.591
It's all my fault.

53:37.801 --> 53:39.178
-Are you gonna be here?
-Yes, sir.

53:39.344 --> 53:41.430
Okay. I've gotta catch an airplane.

53:41.597 --> 53:44.391
If anyone finds the Grafikos,
they'll have both halves.

53:44.558 --> 53:45.893
Some things should stay buried.

53:46.059 --> 53:46.810
I know, Baz.

53:46.977 --> 53:48.770
-It's vital that you destroy it.
-I will, Baz.

53:48.937 --> 53:50.314
-Do you understand?
-I'll destroy it.

53:50.480 --> 53:51.231
-Say you will, Indy.
-Yes.

53:51.398 --> 53:52.399
I will... Yes.

53:52.566 --> 53:54.151
You promised me. Remember that.

53:54.318 --> 53:55.319
I will... I promise.

53:55.485 --> 53:56.361
There's a reason...

53:56.528 --> 53:59.114
a reason that Archimedes broke it in two.

53:59.281 --> 54:00.991
I know, Baz.

54:01.158 --> 54:02.034
Indy.

54:04.036 --> 54:05.329
Thanks, Wombat.

54:05.495 --> 54:07.456
He's gonna be all right in a few days.

54:09.541 --> 54:10.959
I'll call you as soon as I land.

54:16.048 --> 54:17.299
Ladies and gentlemen...

54:17.466 --> 54:19.927
we are 20 minutes from landing in Tangier.

54:53.710 --> 54:55.087
-Stop drinking!
-What are you doing?

54:55.254 --> 54:56.839
No more champagne! How many more...

54:57.005 --> 54:57.881
I'm staying.

54:58.048 --> 54:59.508
Go home. Go home!

55:16.191 --> 55:18.527
Miss Shaw, she's here.

55:22.781 --> 55:23.615
Forged in bronze.

55:24.032 --> 55:25.075
Nearly complete.

55:25.242 --> 55:26.869
It is an astrological clock.

55:27.452 --> 55:29.663
Dating third century BC...

55:29.830 --> 55:33.750
and built by Archimedes himself.

55:35.794 --> 55:37.212
All right, let's start at 20,000.

55:37.379 --> 55:38.463
20,000, thank you very much.

55:38.630 --> 55:39.965
30. 30.

55:40.132 --> 55:41.049
Gauges green...

55:41.592 --> 55:42.801
power full...

55:42.968 --> 55:45.304
and when I reach 85, I rotate.

55:45.929 --> 55:46.763
What next?

55:46.930 --> 55:49.016
-Louis, help him! He's so cute.
-Pull back on the yoke.

55:49.183 --> 55:51.393
-I did, man. I'm airborne.
-Yeah, he's airborne.

55:51.560 --> 55:52.769
-Can I have a sip?
-Do I pick up the flaps?

55:52.936 --> 55:54.938
Don't touch the flaps under 400 feet.

55:55.105 --> 55:56.773
Decrease your pitch to get to 120.

55:56.940 --> 55:57.941
All right.

56:00.527 --> 56:02.779
-Private auction, old timer.
-I've gotta get in there.

56:02.946 --> 56:05.449
No password, no entry.
I don't make the rules.

56:08.285 --> 56:10.037
-And what is the current bid?
-The bid is 50,000.

56:10.204 --> 56:11.455
Then I bid 55.

56:12.414 --> 56:13.415
-Who'll give me 60?
-60.

56:13.582 --> 56:15.083
60. 65?

56:15.250 --> 56:16.418
-65. 70?
-75.

56:16.585 --> 56:17.836
-75. 80?
-80.

56:18.003 --> 56:19.630
-85.
-How about 90?

56:26.637 --> 56:27.471
This auction is private.

56:27.804 --> 56:28.889
This auction's over.

56:29.306 --> 56:30.599
Au contraire, it's hardly begun.

56:30.766 --> 56:32.184
-100.
-100,000.

56:32.351 --> 56:33.894
I like the hat, by the way.

56:34.061 --> 56:35.312
Makes you look at least two years younger.

56:35.479 --> 56:36.563
Thanks.

56:36.730 --> 56:38.315
-110, bravo.
-I told you that this auction is over.

56:38.482 --> 56:39.775
Excuse me, who is this man?

56:39.942 --> 56:41.318
-I'm her godfather.
-He's mildly related.

56:41.485 --> 56:43.403
And she's up past her bedtime.

56:43.570 --> 56:44.780
-Come on, Wombat.
-I wouldn't do that.

56:44.947 --> 56:46.448
You want to explain it to the cops
at the bar?

56:46.615 --> 56:47.950
The ones I paid off?

56:48.492 --> 56:50.077
You're out of your depth, Jonesy.

56:50.244 --> 56:51.578
-"Jonesy"?
-He thinks I'm a criminal.

56:51.745 --> 56:53.497
He's the one wanted for murder.

56:53.664 --> 56:55.707
Nice big picture in the New York Herald. 130?

56:55.874 --> 56:57.501
I didn't kill anyone.

56:57.668 --> 56:59.461
-No entry, it's a private auction.
-And you know it, Helena.

57:00.337 --> 57:03.507
But whoever did was looking for this.

57:04.174 --> 57:06.051
What you've got here is Pandora's Box.

57:07.302 --> 57:08.512
No, actually.

57:09.388 --> 57:10.848
It's my box.

57:13.475 --> 57:14.476
You.

57:16.186 --> 57:17.312
Have we met?

57:17.646 --> 57:18.480
No.

57:18.647 --> 57:20.023
My memory is a little fuzzy...

57:20.190 --> 57:21.900
but your face rings a bell.

57:22.526 --> 57:23.569
Are you still a Nazi?

57:27.656 --> 57:29.825
You're confused. My name is Schmidt.

57:30.409 --> 57:32.578
Professor Schmidt of Alabama University.

57:34.288 --> 57:35.205
Professor Schmidt.

57:35.664 --> 57:36.623
How nice to meet you in person.

57:37.708 --> 57:39.376
-150.
-After our conversation, Miss Shaw...

57:39.543 --> 57:41.503
I thought we'd come to an agreement
about the Dial.

57:41.670 --> 57:43.881
Funny. The last time I saw the other guy
who looks like you...

57:44.047 --> 57:45.799
he was also after this.

57:46.383 --> 57:48.010
Your numbers were light, Professor Schmidt.

57:48.177 --> 57:49.261
But good news is, you're here now.

57:49.428 --> 57:51.889
-The bid is 160.
-You don't seem to understand, Miss Shaw.

57:52.055 --> 57:53.307
This relic is my property.

57:53.473 --> 57:54.975
It's not yours. You stole it.

57:55.142 --> 57:55.893
Then you stole it.

57:56.059 --> 57:57.644
And then I stole it.
It's called capitalism.

57:57.811 --> 57:58.687
The bid is 160.

57:58.854 --> 57:59.730
-160.
-170?

57:59.897 --> 58:00.856
You should've stayed in New York.

58:01.023 --> 58:02.900
-170?
-You should've stayed out of Poland.

58:03.066 --> 58:04.902
170. Anyone? Anyone?

58:05.068 --> 58:06.361
Going, going...

58:06.904 --> 58:07.738
Gone!

58:08.363 --> 58:09.364
Stay away!

58:11.116 --> 58:12.117
Get the Dial.

58:16.955 --> 58:17.789
Stay away!

58:27.090 --> 58:28.008
Oh, hello, Claude.

58:28.175 --> 58:29.551
You should not have come back, Helena.

58:38.644 --> 58:39.937
Get back.

58:50.822 --> 58:51.657
Teddy!

59:06.046 --> 59:07.172
Rahim says you stay.

59:19.142 --> 59:19.977
Thank you.

59:33.073 --> 59:34.533
See you in the past, Dr. Jones.

59:42.541 --> 59:44.293
Move! Get out of the way!

01:00:01.602 --> 01:00:02.603
It's my cab!

01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:09.318
Tell them to back off.

01:00:09.484 --> 01:00:10.861
I just told them to shoot you.

01:00:12.946 --> 01:00:14.156
All right, guys.

01:00:15.532 --> 01:00:16.909
Put the guns down.

01:00:17.075 --> 01:00:18.285
Put 'em down.

01:00:20.412 --> 01:00:21.246
All right.

01:00:22.915 --> 01:00:24.249
That's better.

01:00:28.086 --> 01:00:29.713
Oh, dear.

01:00:39.765 --> 01:00:40.891
Rahim.

01:00:41.975 --> 01:00:43.477
You're in pajamas.

01:00:43.977 --> 01:00:45.687
I was sleeping, Helena.

01:00:46.146 --> 01:00:47.064
Peacefully.

01:00:47.981 --> 01:00:49.816
Then my father woke me.

01:00:49.983 --> 01:00:52.611
He told me you'd returned to our hotel.

01:00:54.112 --> 01:00:56.365
Then he handed me this scimitar...

01:00:56.532 --> 01:00:59.368
and told me to come home with your head.

01:01:01.203 --> 01:01:02.496
Does it have to be that bit?

01:01:10.254 --> 01:01:13.048
I thought maybe you returned
because you loved me.

01:01:13.215 --> 01:01:14.341
Rahim...

01:01:15.092 --> 01:01:16.677
I had an item to sell.

01:01:16.844 --> 01:01:18.720
Excuse me. The item she's talking about...

01:01:18.887 --> 01:01:20.514
-actually belongs to me.
-No. You do not need to...

01:01:20.681 --> 01:01:21.765
-And some very bad people...
-...intrude in this conversation.

01:01:21.932 --> 01:01:24.059
-...worse people, have run off with it.
-You do not need to get involved...

01:01:24.226 --> 01:01:25.143
-with my business.
-Is this your new man?

01:01:25.310 --> 01:01:26.603
-No. No, no.
-It's complicated.

01:01:28.355 --> 01:01:29.857
What exactly do you owe this guy?

01:01:30.023 --> 01:01:32.109
Just some bail money
and a lifetime of happiness.

01:01:32.276 --> 01:01:33.944
I presume you sold the ring.

01:01:34.111 --> 01:01:35.445
It didn't go for as much
as I thought it would.

01:01:35.904 --> 01:01:36.947
I'll do it!

01:01:37.114 --> 01:01:38.156
What are you... Hey!

01:01:44.454 --> 01:01:45.956
You just got me killed!

01:01:46.123 --> 01:01:48.709
Well, I'm not the one that's engaged
to a mobster!

01:01:48.876 --> 01:01:51.795
I don't need morality lessons
from an aging grave robber!

01:01:51.962 --> 01:01:53.172
I'm not a grave robber.

01:01:53.338 --> 01:01:55.632
Your father and I
did important work together.

01:01:58.010 --> 01:02:00.262
Don't tell me all your escapades were noble,
selfless quests.

01:02:00.429 --> 01:02:01.305
You did it for the buzz!

01:02:04.016 --> 01:02:05.058
Oh, good work, Teddy!

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:08.270
-Move over, kid.
-Hey!

01:02:18.947 --> 01:02:20.824
-Helena!
-Back up! Back up!

01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:39.426
Not this way!

01:02:39.593 --> 01:02:40.886
You don't know where you're going, Indy!

01:02:41.053 --> 01:02:42.888
-Listen to him. He knows this town!
-I know Tangier!

01:02:47.392 --> 01:02:48.435
There he is!

01:02:53.565 --> 01:02:55.692
Faster. Go faster!

01:02:55.859 --> 01:02:57.819
Ten minutes to the airport, boss.

01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:02.491
I'm not sure Professor Schmidt
is an actual professor, by the way.

01:03:02.658 --> 01:03:03.784
-He's a Nazi!
-Turn left!

01:03:03.951 --> 01:03:05.494
Turn left! Turn left!

01:03:05.661 --> 01:03:06.745
-Oh, no!
-No!

01:03:21.426 --> 01:03:23.387
Helena! Don't do this!

01:03:31.353 --> 01:03:32.896
-Hey, this way!
-That way!

01:03:33.856 --> 01:03:34.690
No!

01:03:35.816 --> 01:03:37.317
Helena!

01:03:39.361 --> 01:03:40.362
No!

01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:51.623
What the hell?

01:03:58.255 --> 01:03:59.506
Helena!

01:04:01.466 --> 01:04:02.301
Hey!

01:04:02.467 --> 01:04:03.343
Hey!

01:04:03.927 --> 01:04:04.928
What the hell?

01:04:08.223 --> 01:04:09.266
Come on!

01:04:13.061 --> 01:04:14.897
Come on. Come on!

01:04:48.764 --> 01:04:51.391
You think he'd be proud of this?

01:04:51.558 --> 01:04:52.476
Who?

01:04:54.228 --> 01:04:55.062
Your father!

01:04:55.229 --> 01:04:58.148
His only daughter selling her soul
for bail money!

01:04:58.315 --> 01:04:59.691
Sounds quite cool when you put it like that.

01:04:59.858 --> 01:05:01.485
And it's not all bail money.

01:05:01.652 --> 01:05:03.946
-Some of it's gambling debt and some...
-Thank you, Teddy.

01:05:04.112 --> 01:05:05.822
Helena!
No!

01:05:05.989 --> 01:05:06.990
Helena!

01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:10.577
How did you end up like this?

01:05:10.744 --> 01:05:12.079
Well, you mean resourceful?

01:05:12.246 --> 01:05:14.581
Daring? Beautiful? Self-sufficient?

01:05:39.898 --> 01:05:40.732
Hold on!

01:05:44.444 --> 01:05:45.445
Go this way!

01:05:54.997 --> 01:05:55.831
There he is.

01:06:08.552 --> 01:06:10.929
-Stop! Stop!
-Hey! Hey!

01:06:23.650 --> 01:06:24.818
On the left!

01:06:25.944 --> 01:06:26.945
Take the wheel, Teddy!

01:06:29.156 --> 01:06:30.199
What are you doing?

01:06:30.365 --> 01:06:31.909
Getting what's mine.

01:06:32.868 --> 01:06:33.869
Helena!

01:06:38.081 --> 01:06:39.625
Damn it! You crazy?

01:06:42.252 --> 01:06:44.171
Hey! Helena!

01:06:48.133 --> 01:06:49.760
-Take the gun!
-Miss Shaw.

01:06:51.178 --> 01:06:52.846
Let go, Miss Shaw!

01:07:15.702 --> 01:07:16.620
Let go.

01:07:16.787 --> 01:07:19.164
Come on! Give me the Dial!

01:07:20.666 --> 01:07:21.959
Helena!

01:07:23.877 --> 01:07:24.795
Damn.

01:07:31.593 --> 01:07:33.679
-Turn back! They went that way!
-He's gone!

01:07:33.846 --> 01:07:35.681
-Move over!
-Hey!

01:07:39.101 --> 01:07:42.145
I didn't come here to rescue you
from your fiancé!

01:07:42.312 --> 01:07:43.146
Rescue me?

01:07:48.318 --> 01:07:49.945
I just want the Dial back.

01:08:09.381 --> 01:08:10.883
Put your hands above your head.

01:08:12.134 --> 01:08:13.594
Not the smoothest break-up I ever had.

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:15.971
-If your father was still alive...
-Well, he's not, Indy.

01:08:16.138 --> 01:08:17.555
Hey, something's wrong with the engine.

01:08:17.723 --> 01:08:19.725
If only there'd been someone there for me,
some father figure...

01:08:19.892 --> 01:08:22.728
someone specifically anointed for the job.

01:08:22.895 --> 01:08:25.147
-You have no idea about the kind...
-Don't beat yourself up about it.

01:08:25.314 --> 01:08:27.399
I mean, what even is a godfather?

01:08:28.399 --> 01:08:30.444
Anyway, family never was your strong suit.

01:08:31.111 --> 01:08:33.447
-What is the time, by the way?
-It's...

01:08:33.613 --> 01:08:34.615
Hey, no fair.

01:08:35.323 --> 01:08:36.283
Give me that back.

01:08:36.450 --> 01:08:37.658
That was my father's watch!

01:08:40.203 --> 01:08:41.078
Give it back to him.

01:08:45.542 --> 01:08:46.960
You're gonna have to leave town with me.

01:08:47.127 --> 01:08:48.629
Rahim will be looking for you too.

01:08:48.795 --> 01:08:50.005
They'll go to Tangier airport first...

01:08:50.171 --> 01:08:52.341
so we'll need to catch a train
and get a plane from Casablanca.

01:08:54.510 --> 01:08:55.426
What was that?

01:09:00.682 --> 01:09:01.517
Damn.

01:09:03.935 --> 01:09:05.020
Yeah.

01:09:05.187 --> 01:09:06.063
I know, sir.

01:09:08.439 --> 01:09:09.316
Yes...

01:09:10.692 --> 01:09:11.652
Copy.

01:09:16.782 --> 01:09:17.908
They pulled the plug.

01:09:18.158 --> 01:09:19.535
You got them scared.

01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:21.578
-Because they don't understand.
-No.

01:09:21.745 --> 01:09:24.163
Because your associates killed
three American civilians...

01:09:24.331 --> 01:09:26.582
and blew up a nationally televised parade.

01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:29.711
Because you stood up
the President of the United States...

01:09:29.877 --> 01:09:31.046
ran to Morocco...

01:09:31.212 --> 01:09:33.590
and created an incident
that required military extraction!

01:09:35.716 --> 01:09:37.426
Then take me to DC,
and I will explain it all.

01:09:37.594 --> 01:09:38.929
They want you to vanish.

01:09:39.095 --> 01:09:41.223
We have half the Dial now.

01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:42.724
They were just trying to keep you happy...

01:09:43.725 --> 01:09:45.394
letting you chase that thing.

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:46.770
They never cared about it.

01:09:46.937 --> 01:09:49.481
They will, Miss Mason,
when they understand what it can do.

01:09:49.648 --> 01:09:50.774
You put them on the moon.

01:09:51.483 --> 01:09:52.734
They got what they wanted.

01:09:54.027 --> 01:09:55.946
All right, buckle up. We're landing in Spain.

01:09:56.572 --> 01:09:58.574
C-9 transport will take you
from there to Maxwell.

01:09:58.740 --> 01:10:00.200
I'm not going back to Alabama!

01:10:00.367 --> 01:10:02.619
All we need is a vessel to take us
to the Mediterranean.

01:10:03.287 --> 01:10:04.663
The Grafikos will take us to the other...

01:10:04.830 --> 01:10:06.874
Please, Miss Mason. Please.

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:08.083
Let go of me, Schmidt.

01:10:08.250 --> 01:10:09.877
I'm asking you personally.

01:10:10.794 --> 01:10:12.212
You're a piece of work, Doc.

01:10:13.922 --> 01:10:14.756
Hey!

01:10:42.784 --> 01:10:44.286
Schmidt...

01:10:45.204 --> 01:10:46.830
My name is Voller.

01:10:49.625 --> 01:10:51.001
Jürgen Voller.

01:11:04.264 --> 01:11:06.058
That's a Sea Stallion.

01:11:06.225 --> 01:11:07.643
American helicopter.

01:11:08.644 --> 01:11:10.354
Did you know the Wright Brothers?

01:11:10.812 --> 01:11:12.272
-What?
-The Wright Brothers.

01:11:12.439 --> 01:11:13.524
Orville and Wilbur.

01:11:13.690 --> 01:11:15.943
They invented the airplane,
and they lived in Indiana.

01:11:16.109 --> 01:11:17.653
Wilbur was born in Indiana.

01:11:17.819 --> 01:11:20.239
I'm not from Indiana, Teddy.

01:11:20.405 --> 01:11:22.950
And the Wright Brothers were born
during the Civil War.

01:11:23.116 --> 01:11:25.244
Oh, I thought maybe you went to school
with them.

01:11:26.662 --> 01:11:29.122
Oh, come on, Indy. That was funny.

01:11:29.289 --> 01:11:30.123
"Funny"?

01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:34.962
I'm stuck in Tangier with a broken tuk-tuk
and two thieves.

01:11:35.128 --> 01:11:36.296
I'm wanted for murder.

01:11:36.463 --> 01:11:38.423
Nazis have half of Archimedes' Dial...

01:11:38.590 --> 01:11:40.008
and your father's notebooks.

01:11:41.218 --> 01:11:42.386
I have a copy.

01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:44.638
Dad's notebooks. I made a copy.

01:11:44.805 --> 01:11:45.681
Where?

01:11:46.765 --> 01:11:48.725
You memorized five notebooks?

01:11:48.892 --> 01:11:50.102
Seven. And of course not.

01:11:50.269 --> 01:11:51.895
Half of them were as dull as ditchwater.

01:11:52.771 --> 01:11:55.190
Just the really important bits.

01:11:56.191 --> 01:11:57.067
Like what?

01:11:57.526 --> 01:11:58.652
The location of the Grafikos.

01:11:58.819 --> 01:12:00.529
Nobody knows where the Grafikos is.

01:12:00.696 --> 01:12:02.030
-Dad did.
-No, he didn't.

01:12:02.197 --> 01:12:03.365
-Yes, he did.
-No, he didn't.

01:12:03.532 --> 01:12:05.158
-Yes, he did.
-What's a Grafikos?

01:12:05.325 --> 01:12:06.618
It's directions to the rest of the Dial.

01:12:06.785 --> 01:12:08.370
Ask her if she knows what language it's in.

01:12:08.537 --> 01:12:10.372
It isn't in a language. It's in a code.

01:12:10.539 --> 01:12:11.748
What code?

01:12:11.915 --> 01:12:13.375
Archimedes used two codes.

01:12:13.542 --> 01:12:15.085
Linear B and Polybius Square.

01:12:15.252 --> 01:12:18.630
So, even if you find the Grafikos,
without me, you can't read it.

01:12:19.131 --> 01:12:20.424
Please.

01:12:20.591 --> 01:12:22.426
Dad taught me Polybius when I was nine.

01:12:22.593 --> 01:12:24.178
Used to leave little notes around the house.

01:12:24.344 --> 01:12:25.262
"Tidy your room."

01:12:25.429 --> 01:12:26.722
"Stay away from my brandy."

01:12:27.848 --> 01:12:28.891
What if it's Linear B?

01:12:29.850 --> 01:12:31.226
50 quid it's Polybius.

01:12:32.269 --> 01:12:33.395
Give me that.

01:12:33.562 --> 01:12:34.479
Hey.

01:12:34.897 --> 01:12:36.106
That won't work.

01:12:36.273 --> 01:12:38.525
Moroccan chewing gum's made from the sap
of the Manilkara.

01:12:38.692 --> 01:12:39.985
Heat resistant.

01:12:41.486 --> 01:12:42.696
Try and start it.

01:12:47.618 --> 01:12:48.785
-Start it.
-I am.

01:12:50.871 --> 01:12:52.456
Huh? Huh?

01:12:53.165 --> 01:12:54.750
-Huh?
-It won't hold.

01:12:54.917 --> 01:12:56.835
It'll get us to the train station.

01:12:57.002 --> 01:12:58.128
"Us"?

01:12:58.295 --> 01:12:59.505
-You goin' home?
-No.

01:12:59.671 --> 01:13:01.465
I'm going to Casablanca.

01:13:01.632 --> 01:13:03.425
Then I'm gonna hop a plane to the Aegean.

01:13:03.592 --> 01:13:04.468
Just like you.

01:13:04.885 --> 01:13:06.428
What makes you think
we're going to the Aegean?

01:13:06.595 --> 01:13:09.681
You gotta get to the Grafikos
before the Nazis.

01:13:09.848 --> 01:13:11.934
Archimedes was surrounded by Romans.

01:13:12.643 --> 01:13:13.852
Where else would it be?

01:13:14.019 --> 01:13:15.020
The Aegean is huge, Indy.

01:13:15.187 --> 01:13:16.313
And you don't have coordinates.

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:18.023
And you don't have a boat.

01:13:20.943 --> 01:13:23.362
I've got an old friend in Greece.

01:13:23.529 --> 01:13:24.905
An expert diver.

01:13:25.072 --> 01:13:26.907
With a big, beautiful boat...

01:13:27.074 --> 01:13:29.117
that'll get us there before they will.

01:13:29.993 --> 01:13:32.037
You need me...

01:13:32.204 --> 01:13:33.413
and you know it.

01:14:23.547 --> 01:14:24.798
Renny!

01:14:26.884 --> 01:14:27.759
Indy?

01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:29.803
Indy!

01:14:35.267 --> 01:14:37.227
So, that's the expert diver?

01:14:37.394 --> 01:14:39.605
Spain's greatest frogman.

01:14:42.566 --> 01:14:43.400
Hey!

01:14:43.567 --> 01:14:47.029
So, Spain's greatest frogman has a shit boat
and only one good frog leg?

01:14:47.196 --> 01:14:48.238
Stop it.

01:14:52.117 --> 01:14:53.368
You got a different boat.

01:14:53.535 --> 01:14:54.369
Stop it.

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:09.843
We're going here.

01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:13.931
Where they found the first part
of the Antikythera.

01:15:14.848 --> 01:15:15.807
But...

01:15:17.351 --> 01:15:18.644
we're going deeper.

01:15:20.229 --> 01:15:23.941
Dad tracked down the old sponge diver
who found the Dial.

01:15:24.107 --> 01:15:25.275
He told him...

01:15:25.442 --> 01:15:28.403
that the wrecked Roman ship broke up
under the sea...

01:15:28.570 --> 01:15:29.696
70 feet below.

01:15:29.863 --> 01:15:32.824
Filled with the skeletons
of over 100 centurions.

01:15:33.992 --> 01:15:35.160
That's where they found it.

01:15:36.787 --> 01:15:39.831
But he said that most of the ship
had broken off...

01:15:39.998 --> 01:15:41.750
and sunk to the ocean floor.

01:15:42.709 --> 01:15:44.294
Too deep for sponge divers.

01:15:45.337 --> 01:15:48.173
So, Dad started wondering
why a Roman warship...

01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:51.718
would sail out of Syracuse
with 100 centurions on board.

01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:58.809
They weren't taking half a Dial
for a joyride.

01:16:02.646 --> 01:16:04.231
They had the Grafikos...

01:16:07.109 --> 01:16:09.278
and they were looking
for the rest of the Dial.

01:16:12.573 --> 01:16:14.199
Your dad was a genius.

01:16:14.825 --> 01:16:15.742
Yeah.

01:16:17.286 --> 01:16:18.245
He was.

01:16:38.182 --> 01:16:39.183
Seven of spades.

01:16:42.477 --> 01:16:43.562
How do you do that?

01:16:43.729 --> 01:16:44.771
Wow.

01:16:45.606 --> 01:16:46.440
Do it again.

01:16:50.444 --> 01:16:52.321
Pick a card, Dr. Jones.

01:16:59.828 --> 01:17:00.954
Seven of spades!

01:17:03.081 --> 01:17:04.124
She's magic.

01:17:04.291 --> 01:17:05.459
Trick deck.

01:17:05.626 --> 01:17:06.585
No.

01:17:07.794 --> 01:17:09.213
I force the card.

01:17:09.379 --> 01:17:10.672
I offer the mark...

01:17:10.839 --> 01:17:12.007
you...

01:17:12.174 --> 01:17:13.175
the feeling of a choice...

01:17:13.342 --> 01:17:15.552
but ultimately,
I make you pick the card I want.

01:17:17.679 --> 01:17:18.847
"The mark."

01:17:21.892 --> 01:17:23.810
Yeah. Tomorrow is a big day.

01:17:23.977 --> 01:17:25.771
I have to check the lines.

01:17:31.777 --> 01:17:32.861
Good night.

01:17:35.989 --> 01:17:39.117
You remember seeing any dates
in your father's notebooks?

01:17:40.452 --> 01:17:41.828
Dates?

01:17:41.995 --> 01:17:43.288
What dates?

01:17:44.206 --> 01:17:45.207
These dates.

01:17:48.919 --> 01:17:51.380
Written over and over again in this letter.

01:17:52.798 --> 01:17:54.633
August 20th, 1969.

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:56.343
That's three days from now.

01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:58.762
And the same date in 1939.

01:17:58.929 --> 01:18:01.348
Two weeks before Hitler invades Poland.

01:18:03.809 --> 01:18:04.768
Wait.

01:18:05.561 --> 01:18:07.896
Now you believe the Dial has magical powers?

01:18:09.189 --> 01:18:11.233
I don't believe in magic, Wombat.

01:18:13.110 --> 01:18:15.487
But a few times in my life, I've seen things.

01:18:18.615 --> 01:18:20.367
Things I can't explain.

01:18:21.702 --> 01:18:24.079
And I've come to believe it's not so much...

01:18:24.246 --> 01:18:26.373
what you believe.

01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:28.792
It's how hard you believe it.

01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:33.255
I've seen things too, Indy.

01:18:34.173 --> 01:18:36.717
The only thing worth believing in, ever...

01:18:36.884 --> 01:18:38.552
is cash.

01:18:40.846 --> 01:18:41.930
Right.

01:18:47.728 --> 01:18:48.854
What if you could go back in time?

01:18:51.190 --> 01:18:52.232
What would you do?

01:18:53.609 --> 01:18:55.027
Witness the Trojan War?

01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:57.654
Check in on Cleopatra?

01:19:01.283 --> 01:19:03.410
I'd stop my son from enlisting.

01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:08.290
Did he sign up to please you?

01:19:09.374 --> 01:19:11.585
No, he signed up to piss me off.

01:19:15.255 --> 01:19:17.466
How would you have stopped him?

01:19:21.637 --> 01:19:23.472
I'd tell him he was gonna die.

01:19:30.521 --> 01:19:32.397
I'd tell him that his mother would...

01:19:35.025 --> 01:19:36.860
find no end to her grief.

01:19:38.695 --> 01:19:40.447
And that his father would be...

01:19:43.283 --> 01:19:45.202
helpless to console her.

01:19:48.497 --> 01:19:50.999
And that the loss would put an end
to their marriage.

01:20:05.013 --> 01:20:06.223
You're still wearing the ring.

01:20:29.621 --> 01:20:30.581
Promising.

01:20:39.047 --> 01:20:40.465
More promising.

01:20:46.263 --> 01:20:47.347
Hello.

01:20:49.558 --> 01:20:51.560
Get your gear on. They're waiting.

01:20:56.190 --> 01:20:57.024
Hey.

01:20:58.275 --> 01:20:59.276
Come here.

01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:01.528
Okay.

01:21:01.695 --> 01:21:02.487
I'm gonna show you something.

01:21:02.654 --> 01:21:04.573
Gosh, this looks important.

01:21:07.868 --> 01:21:08.702
Around the rope...

01:21:08.869 --> 01:21:11.038
Now, we are going deep.

01:21:11.205 --> 01:21:14.041
Descend fast,
and breathe through these hoses.

01:21:14.208 --> 01:21:15.042
Okay?

01:21:15.501 --> 01:21:17.044
Stay separate.

01:21:17.211 --> 01:21:19.171
No crisscross. All right?

01:21:19.338 --> 01:21:20.506
We cannot stay long.

01:21:20.672 --> 01:21:24.009
I have a method
that usually prevents the bends.

01:21:25.010 --> 01:21:26.053
-Usually?
-Yeah.

01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:27.429
I call it "the bounce."

01:21:27.596 --> 01:21:28.597
You know, fast down...

01:21:28.764 --> 01:21:30.682
three minutes on the bottom, and then up.

01:21:30.849 --> 01:21:31.892
Three minutes!

01:21:32.059 --> 01:21:33.894
No one more second.

01:21:34.561 --> 01:21:35.437
Three minutes.

01:21:35.896 --> 01:21:36.813
Yeah, that's right.

01:21:36.980 --> 01:21:38.815
-Where is my lighter?
-I don't know, capitán.

01:21:40.025 --> 01:21:40.984
We have to go.

01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:44.780
Quick question.

01:21:44.947 --> 01:21:46.281
What's that?

01:21:46.448 --> 01:21:47.741
-They're sharks?
-No.

01:21:47.908 --> 01:21:50.285
No, no. No sharks here. Eels.

01:21:51.370 --> 01:21:52.287
Eels?

01:21:52.454 --> 01:21:53.664
Anguilas.

01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:54.748
Most are small.

01:21:54.915 --> 01:21:56.500
Sometimes they are big. Two meters.

01:21:56.667 --> 01:21:58.710
But if you see them, stay still.

01:21:58.877 --> 01:22:02.089
They bite you, they lock the jaw. Yeah.

01:22:02.256 --> 01:22:03.674
They look like snakes.

01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:05.425
No, they don't.

01:22:05.968 --> 01:22:07.636
Private Brandy reporting for duty.

01:22:08.262 --> 01:22:09.137
You're not coming, Teddy?

01:22:09.888 --> 01:22:11.014
I can't swim.

01:22:11.181 --> 01:22:12.307
Lucky him.

01:22:12.474 --> 01:22:13.767
Everyone can swim.

01:22:15.644 --> 01:22:17.604
Reach and pull. Reach and pull.

01:22:19.648 --> 01:22:21.900
All right. You stay here with Hector
and watch our lines.

01:22:25.737 --> 01:22:26.947
It is time, camarada.

01:24:15.389 --> 01:24:16.306
Two minutes?

01:25:47.773 --> 01:25:48.607
I got it.

01:26:29.606 --> 01:26:30.440
Hey.

01:27:02.514 --> 01:27:03.348
Hurry up!

01:27:18.488 --> 01:27:19.990
Helena!

01:27:28.916 --> 01:27:29.750
Come on.

01:27:29.917 --> 01:27:31.460
That's it. That's it. That's it.

01:27:32.294 --> 01:27:33.504
That's it.

01:27:56.652 --> 01:27:57.903
Who are these people?

01:28:00.364 --> 01:28:01.198
Nazis.

01:28:01.365 --> 01:28:03.825
First, you return my Dial, Dr. Jones...

01:28:03.992 --> 01:28:07.120
and now, you bring me the Grafikos.

01:28:08.038 --> 01:28:10.207
I'm very happy you're not wasting
in retirement.

01:28:10.582 --> 01:28:12.960
I should have retired you
when I had the chance.

01:28:13.126 --> 01:28:14.253
Where are your sponsors?

01:28:14.419 --> 01:28:16.004
I'm on my own now.

01:28:16.171 --> 01:28:17.881
Things move forward, Dr. Jones.

01:28:18.048 --> 01:28:18.924
And sometimes...

01:28:20.801 --> 01:28:22.594
they go backward.

01:28:25.848 --> 01:28:28.100
Now, let's get comfortable
and have a little talk.

01:28:55.169 --> 01:28:56.545
What language is that?

01:28:56.712 --> 01:28:58.297
It's not a language.

01:28:59.548 --> 01:29:00.632
It's a code.

01:29:01.592 --> 01:29:02.467
Polybius.

01:29:03.302 --> 01:29:04.595
You owe me 50 quid.

01:29:06.930 --> 01:29:08.724
Not familiar with Polybius cipher?

01:29:08.891 --> 01:29:09.808
No.

01:29:10.642 --> 01:29:12.060
But it appears you are.

01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:17.399
Read it, please.

01:29:25.824 --> 01:29:26.783
No.

01:29:32.539 --> 01:29:33.540
Indy...

01:29:44.635 --> 01:29:45.928
Feeling helpful now?

01:29:49.348 --> 01:29:50.182
I am.

01:29:53.352 --> 01:29:54.603
I know this stuff backwards.

01:29:54.770 --> 01:29:55.646
No!

01:29:57.523 --> 01:29:58.440
Sorry, Indy.

01:29:58.857 --> 01:30:00.234
I don't do noble death.

01:30:00.901 --> 01:30:01.985
Just...

01:30:02.152 --> 01:30:03.570
cold, hard maths.

01:30:04.112 --> 01:30:05.948
I crack the code,
help you find the other half.

01:30:07.366 --> 01:30:09.034
One hundred grand. Cash.

01:30:09.201 --> 01:30:10.160
Helena...

01:30:10.827 --> 01:30:11.787
Take it or leave it.

01:30:13.330 --> 01:30:14.373
You have a deal.

01:30:27.970 --> 01:30:29.680
He'll never pay you.

01:30:31.223 --> 01:30:34.101
I think you will find this is worth
more than your asking price.

01:30:43.610 --> 01:30:45.112
-Teddy.
-Helena...

01:30:45.279 --> 01:30:46.446
don't do this.

01:30:51.869 --> 01:30:53.287
Let's see what we've got here.

01:30:55.455 --> 01:30:56.832
"My Makhana..."

01:30:57.499 --> 01:30:58.333
that's "machine"...

01:30:59.585 --> 01:31:03.130
"lies with me, in the city I left.

01:31:03.297 --> 01:31:05.674
"Where wolves teach men to walk.

01:31:05.841 --> 01:31:09.970
"Under one of nine, I lie."

01:31:12.806 --> 01:31:14.516
Only one thing lies anywhere forever.

01:31:14.683 --> 01:31:17.394
The dead. So, if the Dial lies with him,
then...

01:31:19.271 --> 01:31:20.772
then this is directions to his tomb.

01:31:21.273 --> 01:31:22.608
The Tomb of Archimedes?

01:31:24.026 --> 01:31:25.819
Undiscovered for two millennia.

01:31:28.906 --> 01:31:30.991
"The city I left."

01:31:31.617 --> 01:31:35.078
Archimedes lived two places his entire life,
so he only left one.

01:31:35.954 --> 01:31:37.956
Anyone? At the back?

01:31:38.832 --> 01:31:40.375
Come on, Indy. Everyone knows this.

01:31:40.542 --> 01:31:41.376
Even this clown.

01:31:41.543 --> 01:31:42.878
Alexandria.

01:31:43.045 --> 01:31:44.087
Full marks.

01:31:45.339 --> 01:31:47.508
Now, "wolf" in Greek is "lycos."

01:31:47.674 --> 01:31:49.927
Root of the word "lycaeum" or "school."

01:31:50.093 --> 01:31:52.721
And the Doric for "walking" is...

01:31:54.139 --> 01:31:54.973
"peripatio."

01:31:56.266 --> 01:31:59.019
Which also happens to be the word for...

01:32:04.274 --> 01:32:06.235
I thought you were a bright spark.

01:32:08.820 --> 01:32:11.949
"Peripatio" means "walking"...

01:32:12.115 --> 01:32:14.535
but it also means "counting."

01:32:14.701 --> 01:32:17.829
So, "Where wolves teach men to walk"...

01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:20.874
-could be...
-The School of Mathematics.

01:32:22.209 --> 01:32:23.794
Is correct.

01:32:23.961 --> 01:32:25.504
Now, the next bit is easy.

01:32:26.797 --> 01:32:28.382
"Beneath one of nine"?

01:32:29.550 --> 01:32:30.884
There are nine Muses.

01:32:31.051 --> 01:32:32.177
The Museon.

01:32:32.344 --> 01:32:34.805
The Greek word
for the Great Library of Alexandria.

01:32:34.972 --> 01:32:38.767
Which, as we all know, has nine statues
supporting its roof.

01:32:38.934 --> 01:32:39.852
May I?

01:32:41.103 --> 01:32:41.937
Thank you.

01:32:43.397 --> 01:32:46.149
The nine Muses, in reverse order...

01:32:47.609 --> 01:32:49.111
are Calliope...

01:32:50.028 --> 01:32:50.863
Urania...

01:32:52.447 --> 01:32:53.490
Polymnia...

01:32:54.449 --> 01:32:55.993
-Erato...
-Polymnia.

01:32:56.201 --> 01:32:58.579
...and Meli whasisname...

01:32:59.121 --> 01:32:59.955
that other one...

01:33:00.831 --> 01:33:01.707
Thalia...

01:33:02.457 --> 01:33:03.667
Euteroe...

01:33:03.834 --> 01:33:05.919
but the first is...

01:33:06.336 --> 01:33:07.171
Clio.

01:33:09.006 --> 01:33:10.174
The Muse of history and time.

01:33:10.340 --> 01:33:11.550
That Archimedes...

01:33:11.717 --> 01:33:12.885
-what a clever bugger.
-The entrance...

01:33:13.051 --> 01:33:15.179
to the tomb
is by the School of Mathematics...

01:33:15.345 --> 01:33:17.055
under a statue of Clio...

01:33:17.222 --> 01:33:19.975
in the ruins
of the Great Library of Alexandria.

01:33:20.142 --> 01:33:21.435
Gold star for Dr. Brains.

01:33:22.978 --> 01:33:23.812
Teddy!

01:33:33.864 --> 01:33:35.324
The Grafikos, get it!

01:34:02.976 --> 01:34:05.687
I have said it before,
and I will say it again!

01:34:05.854 --> 01:34:08.482
When you're in a tight spot, dynamite.

01:34:10.234 --> 01:34:11.777
My friend was just murdered.

01:34:17.282 --> 01:34:18.283
Sorry.

01:34:18.450 --> 01:34:20.202
You told them everything.

01:34:21.912 --> 01:34:22.996
Word for word.

01:34:23.622 --> 01:34:25.541
But Archimedes didn't make it that easy.

01:34:26.333 --> 01:34:28.252
The tomb isn't in Alexandria.

01:34:37.302 --> 01:34:38.303
Go!

01:34:41.807 --> 01:34:42.766
So, what do you see?

01:34:43.433 --> 01:34:45.227
Polybius square.

01:34:45.769 --> 01:34:46.895
Made of?

01:34:49.439 --> 01:34:50.649
Wax and wood.

01:34:52.276 --> 01:34:53.527
Anything else?

01:34:57.114 --> 01:34:57.990
It's heavy.

01:35:01.034 --> 01:35:02.160
Too heavy.

01:35:04.288 --> 01:35:05.414
Give me that.

01:35:45.621 --> 01:35:47.331
This is solid gold?

01:35:47.497 --> 01:35:48.707
Ancient gold.

01:35:50.209 --> 01:35:51.210
From the Nile.

01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:53.879
Hold it, Teddy.

01:36:05.390 --> 01:36:06.475
Sell this thing...

01:36:06.642 --> 01:36:08.310
and we are out of the hole and then some.

01:36:08.477 --> 01:36:09.394
I have just the customer.

01:36:09.561 --> 01:36:12.564
-Cranky, old Duchess in Gibraltar...
-This is going in a museum.

01:36:15.859 --> 01:36:17.152
Take the wheel, Teddy.

01:36:24.034 --> 01:36:25.035
What does it say?

01:36:27.162 --> 01:36:30.040
"Search where Dionysius...

01:36:30.832 --> 01:36:33.585
"hears each whisper...

01:36:34.419 --> 01:36:36.463
"like a hurricane."

01:36:39.299 --> 01:36:40.717
The Ear.

01:36:41.426 --> 01:36:43.220
The cave of Dionysius.

01:36:44.096 --> 01:36:45.055
Where is that?

01:36:46.515 --> 01:36:47.558
In Sicily.

01:36:49.059 --> 01:36:51.144
-How much fuel have we got?
-It's full.

01:37:00.153 --> 01:37:01.154
They're heading west.

01:37:02.531 --> 01:37:03.448
Not east.

01:37:32.477 --> 01:37:33.395
I want the papaya.

01:37:33.562 --> 01:37:34.605
How much is it?

01:37:38.066 --> 01:37:38.942
Take this.

01:37:41.820 --> 01:37:43.989
Look at that kid with the straw hat.

01:37:45.157 --> 01:37:46.074
This way.

01:37:49.244 --> 01:37:50.078
Hey.

01:37:51.705 --> 01:37:52.915
What do you think?

01:37:59.963 --> 01:38:01.215
What are we doing?

01:38:02.841 --> 01:38:04.510
Waiting for closing time at the caves.

01:38:04.676 --> 01:38:06.178
It's crawling with tourists.

01:38:06.345 --> 01:38:08.764
Okay, so he's, like, running the show now?

01:38:10.140 --> 01:38:11.558
He's not running the show, Teddy.

01:38:12.935 --> 01:38:16.063
I just thought we were in this
for all the wrong reasons.

01:38:16.647 --> 01:38:17.814
We are.

01:38:21.318 --> 01:38:22.194
Most assuredly.

01:38:22.361 --> 01:38:25.155
You know he's never gonna let us sell
any of that stuff.

01:38:26.657 --> 01:38:28.325
I'm still in charge, Teddy.

01:38:28.492 --> 01:38:30.494
Helena, get over here! Give me a hand!

01:38:36.416 --> 01:38:37.543
You splurged.

01:38:38.877 --> 01:38:39.837
Here's your backpack.

01:38:40.003 --> 01:38:40.963
Where's the kid?

01:38:54.977 --> 01:38:56.019
Hey, watch it!

01:38:56.645 --> 01:38:57.896
What's wrong with you?

01:39:26.425 --> 01:39:27.593
Hello.

01:39:29.178 --> 01:39:30.012
Hey.

01:39:33.140 --> 01:39:34.016
Let me go!

01:39:35.309 --> 01:39:36.351
Let me go!

01:39:44.151 --> 01:39:46.361
Get off me! Let me go!

01:39:50.032 --> 01:39:50.908
Hey, hey, hey!

01:40:02.085 --> 01:40:03.170
Helena!

01:40:04.546 --> 01:40:06.006
They've got Teddy.

01:40:08.091 --> 01:40:09.676
They took him up the hill somewhere.

01:40:29.780 --> 01:40:30.864
What are they gonna do to him?

01:40:31.031 --> 01:40:33.700
He knows about the Ear,
what the Grafikos says.

01:40:35.077 --> 01:40:36.537
They're not gonna hurt him.

01:40:36.703 --> 01:40:37.871
They're gonna use him...

01:40:38.622 --> 01:40:40.874
to get the other half of the Dial.

01:40:41.041 --> 01:40:42.417
We gotta get there first.

01:40:55.180 --> 01:40:59.226
Colonizing queens built many cities
in Sicily.

01:40:59.393 --> 01:41:00.894
-The temple...
-Let's go.

01:41:01.562 --> 01:41:04.106
...is the oldest of the Greek temples.

01:41:05.190 --> 01:41:06.567
The cave's over there.

01:41:16.952 --> 01:41:18.704
Could we go a little faster, please?

01:41:27.921 --> 01:41:29.381
The Ear of Dionysius.

01:41:37.097 --> 01:41:38.056
Wow.

01:41:52.321 --> 01:41:55.824
"Search where Dionysius hears each whisper
like a hurricane."

01:41:57.034 --> 01:41:58.035
That's some echo.

01:41:59.786 --> 01:42:02.372
Keep making noise till we find out
where it's loudest.

01:42:19.806 --> 01:42:20.641
Stop.

01:42:28.565 --> 01:42:29.691
This is it.

01:42:34.655 --> 01:42:35.656
Greek pediment.

01:42:36.823 --> 01:42:37.824
An entrance.

01:42:39.243 --> 01:42:40.244
Used to be.

01:42:43.539 --> 01:42:44.540
A crescent.

01:42:47.417 --> 01:42:48.502
Just like on the Grafikos.

01:42:56.093 --> 01:42:57.928
I think there's an opening up there.

01:43:04.685 --> 01:43:05.561
You okay up there?

01:43:06.728 --> 01:43:07.563
Yes.

01:43:10.399 --> 01:43:11.441
You're not moving.

01:43:13.944 --> 01:43:15.153
I'm thinking.

01:43:18.115 --> 01:43:18.991
About?

01:43:20.158 --> 01:43:23.078
About what the hell I'm doing up here,
40 feet in the air...

01:43:23.412 --> 01:43:24.997
with crap shoulders...

01:43:25.163 --> 01:43:26.957
crumbling vertebrae...

01:43:27.124 --> 01:43:29.626
a plate in one leg, screws in the other.

01:43:29.793 --> 01:43:31.044
Yeah, I get it. I get it.

01:43:31.670 --> 01:43:32.796
No, you don't get it.

01:43:33.630 --> 01:43:34.840
You're half my age.

01:43:35.883 --> 01:43:38.552
You haven't been forced
to drink the blood of Kali.

01:43:38.719 --> 01:43:39.970
No. Fair enough.

01:43:40.804 --> 01:43:42.556
Or been tortured with voodoo.

01:43:43.932 --> 01:43:46.685
And I'm just guessing, but I don't think
you've been shot nine times...

01:43:46.852 --> 01:43:49.313
including once by your father.

01:43:51.064 --> 01:43:52.399
Dad shot you?

01:43:53.108 --> 01:43:54.276
Don't talk to me.

01:43:54.443 --> 01:43:55.611
Just go ahead. I'll follow you.

01:44:04.369 --> 01:44:05.245
No, no, no.

01:44:05.412 --> 01:44:06.955
We are close. We are close.

01:44:07.122 --> 01:44:08.123
Look around you.

01:44:08.290 --> 01:44:09.791
-We are close.
-The Cave of Dionysius.

01:44:09.958 --> 01:44:10.751
No, no, no.

01:44:10.918 --> 01:44:12.836
The cave is closed for renovation.

01:44:14.922 --> 01:44:15.881
Let me ask again.

01:44:16.048 --> 01:44:17.966
Where is the Cave of Dionysius?

01:44:37.611 --> 01:44:39.780
What's the matter? You worried about the kid?

01:44:41.073 --> 01:44:42.741
Are you sure they won't hurt him?

01:44:42.908 --> 01:44:44.117
He'll be fine.

01:44:44.284 --> 01:44:45.327
He's smart.

01:44:47.204 --> 01:44:48.580
Where'd you find him?

01:44:50.290 --> 01:44:54.962
He tried to steal my purse outside a casino
in Marrakesh when he was 10.

01:44:55.128 --> 01:44:56.964
I hit him repeatedly with my car door...

01:44:57.130 --> 01:44:59.633
but he didn't let go and neither did I.

01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:01.343
So, been together ever since.

01:45:02.469 --> 01:45:04.429
Thought you were all about the money.

01:45:05.556 --> 01:45:06.557
I am.

01:45:09.643 --> 01:45:13.689
Nobody memorizes every page
of their dead father's notebooks...

01:45:13.856 --> 01:45:14.940
for the money.

01:45:21.572 --> 01:45:22.573
Herr Voller!

01:45:33.208 --> 01:45:34.585
They went that way.

01:45:44.928 --> 01:45:45.971
Why?

01:45:49.892 --> 01:45:51.727
Come on, come on.

01:45:54.479 --> 01:45:55.397
Let's go.

01:46:00.235 --> 01:46:01.153
Oh, my...

01:46:04.156 --> 01:46:05.657
Oh, my God!

01:46:06.491 --> 01:46:07.826
Oh, my God!

01:46:08.035 --> 01:46:09.411
-Oh, God!
-No, no.

01:46:10.329 --> 01:46:11.705
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:46:16.251 --> 01:46:17.294
Are they off me?

01:46:17.461 --> 01:46:18.295
-Get 'em off!
-No, no.

01:46:18.462 --> 01:46:19.630
-Get 'em off!
-Wait.

01:46:32.684 --> 01:46:33.644
What is that?

01:46:36.730 --> 01:46:37.773
Methane.

01:46:39.274 --> 01:46:40.484
Don't breathe.

01:46:40.651 --> 01:46:41.652
Don't breathe?

01:46:45.364 --> 01:46:46.740
We've gotta get outta here.

01:46:55.666 --> 01:46:56.583
Athena.

01:46:58.335 --> 01:46:59.628
Goddess of war.

01:47:02.506 --> 01:47:03.715
And reason.

01:47:08.011 --> 01:47:09.388
"Under the moon...

01:47:11.682 --> 01:47:13.684
"life lies at her feet."

01:47:21.441 --> 01:47:22.776
Water displacement.

01:47:23.569 --> 01:47:24.903
Get in the pool!

01:47:25.070 --> 01:47:27.072
Why? Help me open the door.

01:47:27.239 --> 01:47:28.907
Well, they didn't get out the doors!

01:47:29.074 --> 01:47:29.950
Get in the pool!

01:47:30.993 --> 01:47:32.870
Okay, I'm getting in the pool.

01:47:33.036 --> 01:47:34.162
Help me.

01:47:36.874 --> 01:47:38.917
Archimedes was fascinated...

01:47:40.419 --> 01:47:42.379
by water displacement!

01:48:23.587 --> 01:48:24.755
Hey! Get back here!

01:48:24.922 --> 01:48:25.672
Klaber!

01:48:39.895 --> 01:48:41.063
You don't need to do that.

01:49:07.256 --> 01:49:08.090
Hey!

01:49:09.299 --> 01:49:10.133
Give me that!

01:49:12.094 --> 01:49:12.928
No!

01:49:20.352 --> 01:49:21.645
Leave them.

01:49:22.354 --> 01:49:23.981
I said leave them.

01:49:48.422 --> 01:49:49.965
Reach and pull.

01:49:50.132 --> 01:49:51.717
Reach and pull.

01:49:51.884 --> 01:49:54.052
Reach and pull.

01:50:22.497 --> 01:50:24.041
Archimedes' tomb.

01:50:52.986 --> 01:50:54.279
Grab that corner.

01:51:40.617 --> 01:51:41.535
Indy.

01:51:43.912 --> 01:51:45.289
This frieze...

01:51:47.958 --> 01:51:49.209
It's a phoenix.

01:51:49.376 --> 01:51:50.377
A common icon.

01:51:50.544 --> 01:51:52.129
No. Look, it isn't.

01:51:53.714 --> 01:51:55.424
This phoenix has propellers.

01:52:04.308 --> 01:52:05.767
What's this doing here?

01:52:14.568 --> 01:52:17.571
Clocks won't be invented
for 1,000 years...

01:52:18.238 --> 01:52:19.698
much less watches.

01:52:22.242 --> 01:52:23.452
Archimedes used it.

01:52:26.997 --> 01:52:28.373
Dad was right.

01:52:29.124 --> 01:52:29.958
It works.

01:52:30.125 --> 01:52:31.752
Of course it works, Miss Shaw.

01:52:34.463 --> 01:52:35.714
Mathematics works.

01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:39.843
As it conquered space, it will conquer time.

01:52:47.726 --> 01:52:49.645
You've already lost your son, Dr. Jones.

01:52:49.811 --> 01:52:50.729
Your wife is gone.

01:52:50.896 --> 01:52:52.814
Do you really want to lose your godchild?

01:52:55.901 --> 01:52:56.985
For what?

01:52:57.402 --> 01:52:59.571
A world that no longer cares
about men like us.

01:53:11.083 --> 01:53:11.917
Thank you.

01:53:50.622 --> 01:53:51.999
History's greatest moment.

01:53:59.089 --> 01:54:00.382
Its end.

01:54:08.140 --> 01:54:09.057
Throw me the gun!

01:54:19.443 --> 01:54:20.694
Get him outta here.

01:54:20.861 --> 01:54:21.695
Teddy.

01:54:22.738 --> 01:54:23.864
Teddy! Teddy!

01:54:24.031 --> 01:54:25.115
Come on! Go!

01:54:25.282 --> 01:54:26.158
This way. Come on.

01:54:30.245 --> 01:54:31.079
Go!

01:54:35.542 --> 01:54:36.376
Indy!

01:54:38.378 --> 01:54:39.546
Go!

01:54:39.713 --> 01:54:40.964
Go!

01:54:41.131 --> 01:54:42.216
Stop!

01:54:45.594 --> 01:54:47.012
Now what?

01:54:48.639 --> 01:54:49.640
Bring him.

01:54:57.731 --> 01:54:58.732
Helena, come on!

01:54:58.899 --> 01:55:00.234
-Teddy, we can't just leave him.
-We're not!

01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:01.610
Follow me!

01:55:03.570 --> 01:55:04.571
Come on!

01:55:08.492 --> 01:55:09.326
Come on.

01:55:23.757 --> 01:55:25.717
Teddy. Come on. We've got a car.

01:55:30.639 --> 01:55:31.598
Crap.

01:55:37.813 --> 01:55:38.856
Stay there.

01:55:57.749 --> 01:55:58.750
Hop on.

01:56:02.379 --> 01:56:05.299
The first hemisphere sets the destination.

01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:10.387
The second calculates the location
of the fissure...

01:56:11.638 --> 01:56:13.473
in Alexandrine coordinates.

01:56:14.057 --> 01:56:16.935
Have Messner transpose this
to longitude and latitude...

01:56:17.978 --> 01:56:19.855
and transmit waypoints to the pilots.

01:56:31.992 --> 01:56:33.493
Shortcut.

01:56:37.789 --> 01:56:42.169
-You got coordinates for 37.07.
-So, who is it?

01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:44.171
Churchill?

01:56:45.506 --> 01:56:46.507
Ike?

01:56:48.842 --> 01:56:51.345
Who are you gonna kill to win the war?

01:56:52.179 --> 01:56:55.057
In a few minutes,
with the help of Archimedes...

01:56:55.224 --> 01:56:57.100
we shall fly into the eye of this storm...

01:56:57.893 --> 01:57:00.145
and cross into Sicilian airspace...

01:57:00.312 --> 01:57:03.815
on August 20th, 1939.

01:57:04.566 --> 01:57:08.111
We will head north over friendly skies
with enough fuel to reach Munich.

01:57:09.404 --> 01:57:11.031
My quarry will be waiting for me...

01:57:11.198 --> 01:57:14.034
at 16 Prinzregentenplatz...

01:57:14.409 --> 01:57:16.620
for an update on his V-1 rocket.

01:57:23.627 --> 01:57:27.589
What kind of Nazi kills the Führer?

01:57:29.216 --> 01:57:31.885
The kind that believes in victory, Dr. Jones.

01:57:37.140 --> 01:57:40.978
Hitler lit a fire that could have burned
1,000 years.

01:57:41.144 --> 01:57:42.646
I saw every mistake.

01:57:43.438 --> 01:57:44.731
Every blunder.

01:57:44.898 --> 01:57:46.567
And I will correct them all.

01:57:46.733 --> 01:57:49.361
History is a long list of losses, Dr. Jones.

01:57:50.404 --> 01:57:51.655
It's just a question of whose.

01:58:04.334 --> 01:58:05.335
Stop!

01:59:18.492 --> 01:59:19.326
Teddy.

01:59:21.161 --> 01:59:22.162
You think you can fly one of those?

01:59:24.331 --> 01:59:25.165
A Nord?

01:59:27.918 --> 01:59:28.877
Sure.

01:59:29.628 --> 01:59:30.754
It's not a ringing response.

01:59:30.921 --> 01:59:32.548
Well, I haven't flown a Nord.

01:59:32.714 --> 01:59:34.258
You've never flown any plane.

01:59:36.134 --> 01:59:37.261
I'll get it started.

01:59:37.427 --> 01:59:38.679
No, Teddy.

01:59:40.055 --> 01:59:40.889
Crap.

02:00:08.250 --> 02:00:09.835
Fasten your seat belt, Dr. Jones.

02:00:10.002 --> 02:00:11.336
There might be some turbulence.

02:00:12.296 --> 02:00:14.756
You're German, Voller.

02:00:14.923 --> 02:00:16.925
Don't try and be funny.

02:00:40.324 --> 02:00:42.159
Come on, big talker.

02:00:57.132 --> 02:00:57.966
Okay.

02:01:14.816 --> 02:01:16.401
Okay. Okay.

02:01:16.568 --> 02:01:19.112
Gauges green. Power full.

02:01:19.780 --> 02:01:22.282
And when I reach 85, I rotate.

02:02:00.028 --> 02:02:01.446
Okay, wings down.

02:02:03.532 --> 02:02:05.534
Okay, 84 miles an hour.

02:02:05.993 --> 02:02:06.952
Rotate.

02:03:14.853 --> 02:03:16.188
Time to destination?

02:03:17.397 --> 02:03:18.941
60 seconds.

02:03:24.279 --> 02:03:25.739
Continental drift.

02:03:29.159 --> 02:03:30.369
Continental drift!

02:03:32.120 --> 02:03:34.706
Archimedes didn't know
about continental drift.

02:03:35.541 --> 02:03:36.792
He couldn't have!

02:03:37.793 --> 02:03:39.711
It hadn't been observed yet.

02:03:40.712 --> 02:03:42.506
You're off target.

02:03:42.965 --> 02:03:44.842
Your coordinates are based on markers...

02:03:45.592 --> 02:03:48.804
that have been moving for 2000 years!

02:03:48.971 --> 02:03:52.391
You could be off by 10 degrees, by...

02:04:07.364 --> 02:04:08.949
30 seconds.

02:04:10.200 --> 02:04:11.034
Herr Voller...

02:04:11.201 --> 02:04:13.912
Your calculations are wrong!

02:04:14.496 --> 02:04:15.664
-Herr Voller...
-Will you shut up?

02:04:16.331 --> 02:04:17.332
I'm thinking!

02:04:20.294 --> 02:04:21.211
20 seconds.

02:04:24.006 --> 02:04:25.090
Hold the flight path!

02:04:27.092 --> 02:04:28.385
15 seconds.

02:04:31.930 --> 02:04:33.390
I don't know where we're going, Jürgen.

02:04:33.557 --> 02:04:34.391
10 seconds.

02:04:35.309 --> 02:04:35.934
9!

02:04:36.101 --> 02:04:36.935
But it sure as hell...

02:04:37.060 --> 02:04:37.561
8!

02:04:38.187 --> 02:04:38.812
7!

02:04:38.979 --> 02:04:39.646
...ain't 1939!

02:04:39.813 --> 02:04:40.439
6!

02:04:40.606 --> 02:04:41.857
Turn around!

02:04:42.566 --> 02:04:43.442
Abort!

02:04:43.942 --> 02:04:44.693
Turn around!

02:04:45.652 --> 02:04:46.320
ABORT!!!

02:04:46.778 --> 02:04:48.739
We're being pulled in!

02:04:58.749 --> 02:05:00.083
What are you doing?!

02:05:00.292 --> 02:05:01.126
This is my plane!

02:05:01.460 --> 02:05:02.794
You're flying my plane!

02:05:27.611 --> 02:05:28.779
We're going to DIE!!!

02:05:30.113 --> 02:05:31.823
We need to pull up!

02:05:53.679 --> 02:05:54.847
Restart engines!

02:06:23.542 --> 02:06:24.626
That's Sicily.

02:06:24.793 --> 02:06:26.003
1939.

02:06:27.754 --> 02:06:29.173
I did it.

02:06:29.339 --> 02:06:30.841
I did it, Dr. Jones!

02:06:31.008 --> 02:06:32.718
Setting coordinates for Munich.

02:06:39.683 --> 02:06:41.727
Yesterday belongs to us, Dr. Jones.

02:07:06.627 --> 02:07:08.795
Those are Roman triremes.

02:07:37.032 --> 02:07:38.242
Keep it in the air!

02:07:58.512 --> 02:07:59.096
Master...

02:07:59.346 --> 02:08:01.765
The Romans are getting closer.

02:08:03.517 --> 02:08:04.393
They have dragons!

02:08:09.106 --> 02:08:10.482
Amazing.

02:08:19.950 --> 02:08:20.909
Open the door!

02:08:25.873 --> 02:08:26.874
What are you doing?

02:08:27.833 --> 02:08:29.543
What are you doing, you idiots?

02:08:29.710 --> 02:08:31.503
They think we're a monster!

02:08:37.968 --> 02:08:39.469
You have to turn around.

02:08:39.636 --> 02:08:41.555
This is the Siege of Syracuse.

02:08:42.681 --> 02:08:44.016
214 BC.

02:08:44.183 --> 02:08:45.392
You got the wrong war.

02:08:49.146 --> 02:08:49.855
Master...

02:08:53.400 --> 02:08:54.651
Don't ride out there, Master!

02:08:55.235 --> 02:08:56.445
The dragons!!

02:09:06.705 --> 02:09:10.209
We must take down their dragons!

02:09:17.382 --> 02:09:18.217
Boss!

02:09:18.383 --> 02:09:19.218
Change course!

02:09:19.468 --> 02:09:20.844
The portal closes in minutes!

02:09:21.261 --> 02:09:22.179
I have to go back!

02:09:22.638 --> 02:09:23.764
I can't be here!

02:09:23.972 --> 02:09:25.057
I CAN'T STAY HERE!!

02:09:25.224 --> 02:09:26.683
The plane won't make it!!

02:09:56.463 --> 02:09:57.381
Get out of the way!

02:10:03.720 --> 02:10:05.848
How do you like that, you savages?

02:10:08.892 --> 02:10:11.645
Sorry, pal, but you're a Nazi!

02:10:21.697 --> 02:10:23.782
What are you doing here?

02:10:23.949 --> 02:10:25.492
Rescuing you!

02:10:37.045 --> 02:10:37.921
Get him off!

02:10:39.298 --> 02:10:40.382
Indy!

02:10:46.013 --> 02:10:47.222
Parachute!

02:10:50.017 --> 02:10:51.185
I got a parachute!

02:10:52.686 --> 02:10:53.520
Hang on!

02:10:57.316 --> 02:10:58.192
Let go!

02:11:00.527 --> 02:11:01.945
Give me the parachute!

02:11:07.993 --> 02:11:10.120
Grab it. Hang on!

02:11:12.581 --> 02:11:13.415
Indy!

02:11:40.776 --> 02:11:42.236
We're losing altitude!

02:11:43.487 --> 02:11:44.404
We're going down!

02:11:46.323 --> 02:11:47.908
I've lost control!

02:12:06.134 --> 02:12:08.595
Hey, those are my friends.

02:12:08.762 --> 02:12:10.806
Those are my friends. We need to help them!

02:12:11.974 --> 02:12:13.559
Those are my friends!

02:13:15.454 --> 02:13:16.830
Eureka.

02:13:34.014 --> 02:13:34.890
He's trying to land.

02:13:35.057 --> 02:13:37.059
Come on, Indy. Help me.

02:13:37.809 --> 02:13:39.853
Get up. Yeah.

02:13:40.020 --> 02:13:42.314
We need to get you out of here. Okay.

02:13:44.233 --> 02:13:45.526
Help me. Sit up, okay?

02:13:46.401 --> 02:13:47.653
Sit up. You need to help me.

02:13:47.819 --> 02:13:49.696
I know it hurts, but we gotta get you back.

02:13:49.863 --> 02:13:52.574
This is incredible, Wombat.

02:13:53.116 --> 02:13:55.077
Incredible.

02:13:56.620 --> 02:13:58.330
Yeah, it very well is.

02:13:58.497 --> 02:14:00.082
But we have to get you out of here.

02:14:02.209 --> 02:14:03.335
My God.

02:14:05.003 --> 02:14:06.880
We're witnessing history.

02:14:13.971 --> 02:14:15.764
Reverse these numbers.

02:14:15.931 --> 02:14:17.015
They'll get you home.

02:14:18.851 --> 02:14:19.685
What?

02:14:22.604 --> 02:14:23.814
I'm going to stay.

02:14:24.565 --> 02:14:26.567
No. You're not serious.

02:14:29.403 --> 02:14:30.445
Wow, you are serious.

02:14:34.533 --> 02:14:36.243
Indy, you've been shot.

02:14:36.410 --> 02:14:37.244
You're bleeding.

02:14:37.619 --> 02:14:39.204
You can't stay here.

02:14:39.371 --> 02:14:40.247
Yes, I can.

02:14:40.914 --> 02:14:41.874
But for what?

02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:45.586
For a long, painful death
with poultice and leeches?

02:14:46.628 --> 02:14:48.755
I've imagined this, Wombat.

02:14:49.840 --> 02:14:51.675
Studied it.

02:14:51.842 --> 02:14:53.886
-All my life.
-Yeah.

02:14:54.052 --> 02:14:57.139
And if you stay here,
you will muck it all up.

02:14:57.306 --> 02:14:58.140
And die.

02:14:58.891 --> 02:15:00.517
Please, get up.

02:15:02.269 --> 02:15:03.437
Helena!

02:15:03.979 --> 02:15:04.771
I did it!

02:15:04.938 --> 02:15:07.274
Bravo, Teddy! Three cheers!

02:15:07.441 --> 02:15:08.984
Okay. Indy, we've gotta go. Get up.

02:15:09.151 --> 02:15:10.611
-I need to get you into that plane, okay?
-No.

02:15:10.777 --> 02:15:11.695
-We need to.
-No.

02:15:11.862 --> 02:15:13.488
Get up. You can... We can!

02:15:26.668 --> 02:15:27.294
Master!

02:15:30.172 --> 02:15:31.965
We have to leave, Master.

02:15:33.592 --> 02:15:34.593
It's him.

02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:45.604
He's asking how far we've come.

02:15:49.024 --> 02:15:51.777
Two thousand years.

02:15:52.402 --> 02:15:53.570
We've come...

02:15:54.154 --> 02:15:57.157
two thousand years.

02:15:59.493 --> 02:16:02.621
But we didn't expect to meet...

02:16:03.163 --> 02:16:05.666
the great...

02:16:06.208 --> 02:16:08.252
Archimedes.

02:16:13.924 --> 02:16:14.842
You...

02:16:16.051 --> 02:16:17.386
were always...

02:16:18.053 --> 02:16:19.304
going to...

02:16:19.888 --> 02:16:21.473
meet me.

02:16:22.224 --> 02:16:24.017
That dial is a forced deck.

02:16:24.184 --> 02:16:25.602
It doesn't take us anywhere but here.

02:16:25.769 --> 02:16:27.062
He built it to get help.

02:16:27.229 --> 02:16:29.773
Well, we just scared off
the entire Roman Navy...

02:16:29.940 --> 02:16:30.858
so I think we've helped enough.

02:16:31.066 --> 02:16:32.692
Apologies, Archimedes.

02:16:32.901 --> 02:16:34.236
I'm a fan...

02:16:34.486 --> 02:16:36.487
but we need to leave. He's hurt.

02:16:36.655 --> 02:16:37.531
Helena...

02:16:37.698 --> 02:16:38.740
He can't keep that, by the way.

02:16:38.906 --> 02:16:39.782
He needs to build his own one.

02:16:39.950 --> 02:16:41.660
Helena, we need to go!

02:16:42.119 --> 02:16:44.245
Indy, the window is closing!

02:16:44.413 --> 02:16:45.539
We cannot get stuck here!

02:16:47.040 --> 02:16:47.665
I want...

02:16:47.875 --> 02:16:48.959
to stay...

02:16:49.334 --> 02:16:51.085
with you.

02:16:51.253 --> 02:16:53.213
No, no, no! Do not say yes!

02:16:53.797 --> 02:16:56.049
You are a brilliant man...

02:16:56.299 --> 02:16:58.302
a wise man...

02:16:58.843 --> 02:17:00.179
a genius...

02:17:00.344 --> 02:17:01.180
Helena...

02:17:01.346 --> 02:17:03.682
a hero to your people.

02:17:04.391 --> 02:17:07.936
But he can't help you.

02:17:09.021 --> 02:17:10.731
This is your time.

02:17:10.897 --> 02:17:11.607
This is your time.

02:17:11.772 --> 02:17:13.734
He must be in his own time -

02:17:13.901 --> 02:17:14.985
He needs to be in his.

02:17:15.152 --> 02:17:16.111
His work is not done.

02:17:16.486 --> 02:17:17.446
He needs to go home.

02:17:17.612 --> 02:17:19.198
There is medicine at home.

02:17:19.364 --> 02:17:21.157
He cannot die here. He can't.

02:17:22.825 --> 02:17:25.662
Helena, get on the plane.

02:17:28.248 --> 02:17:29.333
I'll be all right.

02:17:31.168 --> 02:17:32.544
No, you won't.

02:17:35.464 --> 02:17:37.216
I need to do this.

02:17:38.467 --> 02:17:39.300
Me too.

02:18:33.939 --> 02:18:34.815
Good morning.

02:18:39.695 --> 02:18:41.071
How's the shoulder?

02:18:43.740 --> 02:18:46.243
Better than my jaw.

02:18:49.871 --> 02:18:50.873
Right.

02:18:52.875 --> 02:18:54.376
You should've let me stay.

02:18:55.252 --> 02:18:56.460
I couldn't do that.

02:19:05.469 --> 02:19:06.388
Why not?

02:19:08.348 --> 02:19:10.893
Well, for starters, you'd have changed
the course of history.

02:19:15.230 --> 02:19:17.023
That's supposed to be a bad thing?

02:19:21.153 --> 02:19:22.946
You're meant to be here, Indy.

02:19:26.825 --> 02:19:27.659
Here.

02:19:32.873 --> 02:19:33.999
For who?

02:20:01.318 --> 02:20:02.903
Marion.

02:20:04.154 --> 02:20:05.197
Hey.

02:20:24.550 --> 02:20:25.467
Teddy.

02:20:27.094 --> 02:20:28.053
Marion.

02:20:30.848 --> 02:20:31.807
What are you doing?

02:20:33.350 --> 02:20:34.518
Putting groceries away.

02:20:36.812 --> 02:20:39.523
There wasn't a scrap of food in this place.

02:20:40.440 --> 02:20:42.442
No. Really.

02:20:47.239 --> 02:20:49.449
Someone told me you were back.

02:20:56.915 --> 02:20:58.542
Are you back, Indy?

02:21:00.169 --> 02:21:01.879
It was explosives...

02:21:02.045 --> 02:21:04.173
and Indy was running,
Marion was running...

02:21:04.339 --> 02:21:07.009
and suddenly the plane exploded.

02:21:10.721 --> 02:21:12.764
Indy, you're up and about.

02:21:13.974 --> 02:21:15.350
Yes, I am.

02:21:16.643 --> 02:21:17.477
Yes.

02:21:18.103 --> 02:21:20.147
Why don't we go and get some ice cream, kids?

02:21:20.314 --> 02:21:21.565
But Marion just bought some.

02:21:21.732 --> 02:21:22.816
Oh, I know a better place.

02:21:22.983 --> 02:21:25.194
You can never have too much ice cream,
can you?

02:21:29.072 --> 02:21:29.907
See you later.

02:21:33.118 --> 02:21:36.413
A British tar is a soaring soul

02:21:36.580 --> 02:21:39.416
As free as a mountain bird

02:21:39.583 --> 02:21:41.418
His energetic fist

02:21:41.585 --> 02:21:44.004
Should be ready to resist...

02:21:45.881 --> 02:21:47.174
That looks bad.

02:21:48.675 --> 02:21:49.927
Does it hurt?

02:21:52.471 --> 02:21:53.931
Everything hurts.

02:21:56.808 --> 02:21:58.435
I know how that feels.

02:22:04.525 --> 02:22:07.194
Well, where doesn't it hurt?

02:22:15.327 --> 02:22:16.161
Here.

02:22:17.538 --> 02:22:18.789
It doesn't hurt here.

02:22:27.047 --> 02:22:28.590
And here.

02:22:52.197 --> 02:22:54.575
Jabari, Alia, slow down!

02:22:54.741 --> 02:22:56.869
Helena! Hurry up!

02:22:57.035 --> 02:22:59.705
I scream, you scream...

02:22:59.872 --> 02:23:01.623
Everybody, slow down.

02:23:01.707 --> 02:23:04.168
-I scream, you scream
-I scream, I scream

02:23:04.334 --> 02:23:06.044
We all scream for ice cream!

02:23:06.211 --> 02:23:07.379
Slow down.
