WEBVTT

00:06.440 --> 00:08.642
Okay, so I'll see you
after the deposition.

00:08.742 --> 00:09.677
Okay.

00:09.777 --> 00:11.679
Wait, is that
your cousin Joey?

00:11.779 --> 00:13.347
Anthony.

00:13.447 --> 00:15.316
Oh, great.

00:16.950 --> 00:18.252
Hey.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.320
Hi.

00:19.420 --> 00:20.588
It's good to
see you guys.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.190
Yeah, wish I could say the same,

00:22.290 --> 00:23.524
but now's not a good time.

00:23.624 --> 00:24.758
Come on, that's no way

00:24.858 --> 00:26.494
to treat your guardian angel.

00:26.594 --> 00:27.995
You know I took
a bullet for him?

00:28.096 --> 00:30.231
I heard.
A year and a half ago.

00:30.331 --> 00:31.999
Am I ever gonna live that down?

00:32.100 --> 00:35.169
Well, that depends.
I sort of need a favor.

00:35.269 --> 00:36.570
Of course you do.

00:37.338 --> 00:38.472
Just a place to crash,
that's it.

00:38.572 --> 00:39.907
What's wrong
with your apartment?

00:40.708 --> 00:43.544
I kind of had a falling out
with my landlord.

00:43.644 --> 00:45.279
I maybe, kind of slept
with his wife

00:45.379 --> 00:47.047
a little bit. Lovely.

00:47.148 --> 00:48.382
Anthony,
come on.

00:48.482 --> 00:51.419
You owe me. You know you do.

00:55.223 --> 00:57.191
Fine. Just for the week.

00:57.291 --> 00:59.160
That's all
you get.
Oh, thank you.

00:59.260 --> 01:00.261
Oh, this is
gonna be great.

01:00.361 --> 01:01.495
It'll be like when we was kids.

01:01.595 --> 01:03.631
Mmm.
Get the hell out of here.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.366
Now.

01:05.466 --> 01:07.835
You sure this is a good idea?

01:07.935 --> 01:09.503
I know it's not.

01:11.639 --> 01:13.274
Excuse me, I'm Officer Janko.

01:13.374 --> 01:14.842
We got a report of an assault.

01:14.942 --> 01:18.146
Hey. Yeah. Isabella.
I'm the one who called it in.

01:18.246 --> 01:19.980
This guy came in and...

01:21.782 --> 01:22.883
Luis.

01:22.983 --> 01:24.618
Isabella.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.520
You two know each other?

01:26.620 --> 01:28.656
You know what, never mind.
Forget I called.

01:28.756 --> 01:31.559
Wait. Wait a second.
What's going on here?

01:33.427 --> 01:35.263
Oh, okay, one of
you needs to talk.

01:35.363 --> 01:37.531
Isabella and I used to go out.

01:37.631 --> 01:39.133
"Used to go out"?

01:39.233 --> 01:40.868
What, are we
in middle school?

01:40.968 --> 01:42.203
We were actually

01:42.303 --> 01:44.405
in a serious relationship
for an entire year.

01:44.505 --> 01:45.639
Okay.

01:45.739 --> 01:47.007
Yeah, I'm sorry,
I'm not doing this,

01:47.107 --> 01:48.142
not with him here.

01:48.242 --> 01:49.810
I'll meet you
in the RMP.

01:50.878 --> 01:51.812
Eddie.

01:51.912 --> 01:53.581
Go.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.324
I can't believe it.

02:03.424 --> 02:04.525
Out of all the cops in the city,

02:04.625 --> 02:05.959
of course, it has to be him.

02:06.059 --> 02:08.128
Listen, I don't know what
happened between you two,

02:08.229 --> 02:12.266
but right now I... I need
to know what happened here.

02:12.366 --> 02:14.935
Yeah, um...

02:15.703 --> 02:18.005
This guy came in,
he was super drunk.

02:18.105 --> 02:20.140
He started hitting on me
and asked for my number

02:20.241 --> 02:22.210
and got really angry when
I wouldn't give it to him.

02:22.310 --> 02:23.544
I told him

02:23.644 --> 02:25.746
to leave, and he
busted my lip.

02:25.846 --> 02:27.815
You got a description
of the guy?

02:27.915 --> 02:30.851
Yeah, just as long as you keep
Luis the hell away from me.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.956
Reagan, Baez, my office.

02:42.330 --> 02:43.264
What's up, boss?

02:43.364 --> 02:45.566
The precinct received

02:45.666 --> 02:47.167
some funeral flowers
this morning.

02:47.268 --> 02:48.336
They just
came addressed

02:48.436 --> 02:49.437
to the
entire squad?

02:49.537 --> 02:51.138
Came with a card, too.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.375
"Sorry for your loss." What...?

02:54.475 --> 02:55.843
What loss?

02:55.943 --> 02:58.246
We haven't lost anyone
in the squad recently.

02:58.346 --> 02:59.613
Or a family member.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.081
We thinking this is
some kind of threat?

03:01.181 --> 03:03.484
Yes.
And we're sure it wasn't

03:03.584 --> 03:05.753
just some kid playing a prank?

03:05.853 --> 03:08.088
Yes. I want them
found, arrested.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.357
This is our house.

03:09.457 --> 03:10.924
Nobody disrespects our house.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.693
Copy that.

03:17.398 --> 03:18.899
What's wrong?

03:18.999 --> 03:20.868
I know who it is.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.336
What do you mean,
you know who it is?

03:22.436 --> 03:23.904
I know who sent this.

03:24.972 --> 03:27.708
12 years ago, I put
a man named Sam Evans away

03:27.808 --> 03:29.277
for a brutal murder.

03:29.377 --> 03:31.645
What makes you think he's
the one that sent the flowers?

03:31.745 --> 03:35.416
At the trial,
he was just staring at me

03:35.516 --> 03:37.285
the whole time
I was on the stand.

03:37.385 --> 03:39.553
Not for nothing, but that's
probably what I would do, too.

03:39.653 --> 03:42.323
The whole time. I'm serious.

03:42.423 --> 03:44.525
Okay, okay, I understand.

03:44.625 --> 03:48.228
We all have that one perp
that we're afraid

03:48.329 --> 03:50.531
is gonna come back and pay us
a visit when they get out.

03:50.631 --> 03:52.466
Mine got out today.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.802
Today.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.139
I got to tell you,
the food's

03:59.239 --> 04:00.708
just not as good here
as it used to be.

04:00.808 --> 04:02.476
It was never good,
you just liked

04:02.576 --> 04:03.611
coming here for the waitresses.

04:03.711 --> 04:04.812
Nah, just that redhead Kate.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.347
You know, the one that got away.

04:06.447 --> 04:08.882
She didn't get away,
she just told you to get lost.

04:08.982 --> 04:11.452
Well, she didn't like cops,
was my theory.

04:11.552 --> 04:12.820
Nothing I could've said or done.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.255
Actually, she married a cop.

04:15.356 --> 04:16.957
She did?

04:17.057 --> 04:19.427
Yep. Benny Mason.

04:19.527 --> 04:21.295
That little meatball?

04:21.395 --> 04:23.297
So, now you have
to ask yourself,

04:23.397 --> 04:25.699
what did he have
that you didn't?

04:25.799 --> 04:27.435
40-inch waist?

04:27.535 --> 04:29.870
Kate wasn't looking
for a good time.

04:29.970 --> 04:32.172
She was looking for a husband,
and Benny could see that.

04:32.272 --> 04:35.075
Now, what are you doing
up here anyway?

04:36.777 --> 04:39.580
Well, you know, I was feeling
a little too good about myself,

04:39.680 --> 04:41.349
so I thought I'd come up
here and balance it

04:41.449 --> 04:42.916
with a dose of you.

04:43.851 --> 04:46.987
And what are you doing
up here anyway?

04:47.788 --> 04:50.157
It's New York.
I need a reason?

04:50.257 --> 04:52.125
Doctor or lawyer?

04:52.225 --> 04:54.562
At our age,
it's one or the other.

04:54.662 --> 04:55.896
I just missed it here, is all.

04:55.996 --> 04:58.866
Come on. Hang on.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.935
Oh, I'm sorry, Frankie.

05:02.035 --> 05:03.404
Looks like I'm gonna
have to eat and run.

05:03.504 --> 05:04.438
What happened?

05:04.538 --> 05:06.574
Oh, just a thing came up.

05:06.674 --> 05:08.709
Bad thing, good thing?

05:08.809 --> 05:10.644
Just a thing needs me in person.

05:10.744 --> 05:13.213
Oh, and for the record?
Wasn't even my turn.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.716
Lenny...
Uh-uh, got to go.

05:47.147 --> 05:48.716
You can't do this every...
This is not a big deal.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.451
You have
to understand something.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.653
You get arrested enough times,
it's gonna be harder for you

05:52.753 --> 05:54.321
to get out of these things.
But I can-- I can call you.

05:54.422 --> 05:55.489
I don't know,
what is the problem?

05:55.589 --> 05:56.724
It's not about you calling me,

05:56.824 --> 05:58.158
it's about not
drinking too much,

05:58.258 --> 06:00.794
okay?
I didn't drink
too... much.

06:02.530 --> 06:04.164
What are you doing here?

06:05.699 --> 06:10.037
Well... I had
my detail tail you.

06:10.137 --> 06:11.972
You did what?

06:12.072 --> 06:13.807
"A thing," Lenny?

06:13.907 --> 06:15.609
I was worried.

06:21.248 --> 06:24.818
And you would be... Tess?

06:26.286 --> 06:27.821
Frank.

06:28.689 --> 06:31.291
Nice to finally meet you.

06:31.391 --> 06:34.462
And you as well.

06:36.697 --> 06:38.599
Everything okay?

06:39.967 --> 06:42.603
Yeah, it's fine.
Just a little family issue.

06:42.703 --> 06:44.304
The officer
did me a solid

06:44.404 --> 06:45.939
and called
my dad.

06:47.207 --> 06:49.109
So you have
your dad's courtesy card?

06:49.209 --> 06:50.410
Of course she does.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.647
I only use it
in emergencies, I swear.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.583
Such as?

06:55.683 --> 06:58.719
Such as when
the bartender 86s you

06:58.819 --> 06:59.753
and the bouncer

06:59.853 --> 07:01.221
lays on hands before
you can even

07:01.321 --> 07:03.256
get your coat on, so you react.

07:03.356 --> 07:05.459
And the manager
calls the police.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.995
Response time
was, like, lickety-split.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.262
You guys are crushing it.

07:09.362 --> 07:10.631
Okay, Tess,
that's-that's enough.

07:10.731 --> 07:12.265
Look.

07:13.701 --> 07:15.068
It was just a couple
of minor offenses.

07:15.168 --> 07:16.637
She's going through
a rough patch, that's all.

07:16.737 --> 07:19.239
Oh, I'm going through
a rough patch?

07:19.339 --> 07:20.841
What about you?

07:22.976 --> 07:24.712
What about you?

07:24.812 --> 07:27.347
Wait, he doesn't know?
Tess...

07:27.447 --> 07:29.149
He's got some of that bad stuff

07:29.249 --> 07:30.884
from working on the 9/11 pile.

07:30.984 --> 07:34.722
Nah, it's just that my asthma
has been acting up. That's all.

07:34.822 --> 07:36.023
And by the way,

07:36.123 --> 07:37.691
you put
a tail on me?

07:37.791 --> 07:39.092
Who does that?

07:39.192 --> 07:41.529
Your concerned old friend.

07:41.629 --> 07:44.765
Well, thank you. You can go now.

08:01.414 --> 08:03.283
Sam Evans.

08:03.383 --> 08:04.885
Yeah.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.254
I'm here to meet with
my parole officer Jimmy?

08:07.354 --> 08:09.957
He took the day off.
You got us instead.

08:10.057 --> 08:11.291
I know you.

08:11.391 --> 08:12.726
Hello, Sam.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.028
Detective Baez.

08:15.128 --> 08:16.396
What are you doing here?

08:16.496 --> 08:19.299
We're here to ask you
a few questions.

08:19.399 --> 08:21.569
Like what you've been
up to since you got out.

08:21.669 --> 08:24.204
Making up for lost time.

08:24.304 --> 08:25.405
What's that mean?

08:25.505 --> 08:28.041
Strolls through the park, mostly.

08:28.141 --> 08:31.679
Or maybe sending threatening
letters to old acquaintances?

08:31.779 --> 08:35.015
No? What are you talking about?

08:35.115 --> 08:38.085
You sent a bouquet
of flowers to our precinct

08:38.185 --> 08:39.152
with a threatening note.

08:39.252 --> 08:41.121
You think I sent flowers?

08:41.221 --> 08:42.522
Don't play dumb.
I know it was you.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.692
I didn't send that.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.495
I'm not the person
I was all those years ago.

08:48.596 --> 08:51.364
You lured your coworker
into a back alley

08:51.464 --> 08:53.701
and beat his head
to a literal pulp.

08:54.802 --> 08:56.536
No.

08:56.637 --> 08:59.339
We got into an argument.
It was self-defense.

08:59.439 --> 09:01.809
Save it for the jury
at your next trial.

09:02.610 --> 09:06.013
12 years is a long time, Detective.

09:06.113 --> 09:08.849
I spent that time
thinking about everything.

09:10.183 --> 09:11.785
About what happened.

09:11.885 --> 09:15.222
I'm a new man now
with new purpose.

09:16.023 --> 09:19.092
Are you trying to
tell us something, Sam?

09:20.427 --> 09:22.529
Not at all.

09:22.630 --> 09:24.531
I just got out.

09:26.033 --> 09:28.135
Last thing I want is
to go back to prison.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.803
God's honest truth.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.471
I'm not your guy.

09:32.773 --> 09:35.275
Now, do I need
to call my attorney,

09:35.375 --> 09:37.577
or am I free to go?

09:38.612 --> 09:40.480
We'll be watching you.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.564
We got an image of
the guy coming through the door

09:57.665 --> 09:59.299
on the bar's
surveillance camera.

09:59.399 --> 10:00.934
Facial recognition's
processing it now,

10:01.034 --> 10:03.904
so if there's a match,
we should know soon.

10:04.004 --> 10:05.272
Good.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.741
So, what happened
between you and Isabella?

10:07.841 --> 10:08.909
Nothing.

10:09.009 --> 10:10.110
Oh, come on.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.179
We dated, it ended.
That's it.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.313
I bet you
ghosted her

10:13.413 --> 10:15.515
like you did
that girl last year.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.017
Look, when
I end a relationship,

10:17.117 --> 10:18.151
I like a clean break.

10:18.251 --> 10:20.688
None of this
"On again, off again,

10:20.788 --> 10:21.922
dragging it out for
another year" crap.

10:22.022 --> 10:23.090
So you just get in deep,

10:23.190 --> 10:24.457
and then you cut and
run. That's your MO?

10:24.557 --> 10:26.326
It's not my MO.

10:26.426 --> 10:27.394
I just don't
like to make things

10:27.494 --> 10:28.595
into more
than they are.

10:28.696 --> 10:29.897
Sounds more like
you don't want to

10:29.997 --> 10:31.598
take responsibility
for what went wrong.

10:31.699 --> 10:33.300
It's not my fault
these women

10:33.400 --> 10:35.969
get crazy and emotional
when I leave.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.507
Hey, hey.
What is it?

10:40.607 --> 10:42.509
Uh, facial recognition
got a possible

10:42.609 --> 10:43.744
on a guy named

10:43.844 --> 10:44.978
Erik Rys.

10:45.078 --> 10:47.114
He's had a few past
misdemeanor collars

10:47.214 --> 10:49.616
for assault three,
disorderly conduct.

10:49.717 --> 10:50.884
His employment's listed

10:50.984 --> 10:52.686
at a restaurant
in Williamsburg.

10:52.786 --> 10:54.121
Huh.

10:55.222 --> 10:56.589
Let's go get lunch.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.935
Erik Rys?

11:08.035 --> 11:09.369
Yeah?

11:09.469 --> 11:11.638
I'm Officer Janko,
this is Officer Badillo.

11:11.739 --> 11:13.506
We have a few
questions for you.

11:14.708 --> 11:15.776
You ever been
to the Crow's Nest?

11:15.876 --> 11:17.144
It's a bar
on West Fourth Street.

11:17.244 --> 11:18.678
Yeah, why?

11:18.779 --> 11:20.347
You know the bartender
there, Isabella?

11:20.447 --> 11:22.249
I'm not sure.

11:22.349 --> 11:25.352
Cute. Dark hair,
lot of attitude.

11:25.452 --> 11:28.088
Yeah, yeah. You know,
maybe I've seen her around.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.290
Yeah? Maybe Monday afternoon
when she was working?

11:30.390 --> 11:31.959
Nope.

11:32.059 --> 11:33.260
Okay, look, Erik.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.594
This will go a lot
easier if you're just

11:34.694 --> 11:35.996
honest with us.

11:36.096 --> 11:37.497
There's always
two sides to every story.

11:37.597 --> 11:39.532
Why don't you tell us yours?

11:39.632 --> 11:41.701
She talked to you?

11:42.569 --> 11:43.804
What did she tell you?

11:43.904 --> 11:45.839
What did
she say about me?

11:45.939 --> 11:47.841
She said you got in an argument

11:47.941 --> 11:50.878
after she turned down
your advances.

11:50.978 --> 11:52.679
Oh, I asked her for her number.

11:52.780 --> 11:54.347
All right?
It wa-wasn't a big deal.

11:54.447 --> 11:56.884
She's the one who got all
crazy and emotional about it.

11:56.984 --> 11:58.518
You know how some
women can get.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.989
So she got upset,
and you did what exactly?

12:02.089 --> 12:03.791
I left.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.192
Okay.

12:05.292 --> 12:08.095
Well, we appreciate you
telling us what happened.

12:09.997 --> 12:11.098
Hmm.

12:12.132 --> 12:13.400
Looks like you got some bruises

12:13.500 --> 12:15.535
on your knuckles.

12:15.635 --> 12:16.469
How'd that happen?

12:16.569 --> 12:17.838
Hey, I don't know.

12:17.938 --> 12:21.008
Wouldn't be from hitting
Isabella, now, would it?

12:23.410 --> 12:25.178
I-I think I want a lawyer.

12:25.278 --> 12:27.180
Why don't you call one
from the station?

12:30.050 --> 12:32.119
How the hell did you
lock yourself out?

12:32.219 --> 12:33.453
I swear, I had it.

12:33.553 --> 12:35.022
God, you're an idiot.

12:35.889 --> 12:38.258
I got a spare one
in the car. Come on.

12:38.358 --> 12:39.526
You lose this one, too,

12:39.626 --> 12:41.728
I'm telling you,
don't bother coming back.

12:41.829 --> 12:43.596
Hey, what is with

12:43.696 --> 12:45.732
the hostility
all the time?

12:45.833 --> 12:47.334
It was an
honest mistake.

12:47.434 --> 12:50.037
Nothing you do
is ever honest.

12:50.137 --> 12:51.905
You're so uptight
all the time.

12:52.005 --> 12:53.941
You really need to
learn to relax...

13:05.585 --> 13:07.187
What the hell?!

13:17.097 --> 13:18.431
What the hell
is wrong with you?

13:18.531 --> 13:19.666
Are you okay?
What happened?

13:19.766 --> 13:21.301
My idiot cousin's
what happened.

13:21.401 --> 13:22.702
Take it easy,
will you?

13:22.802 --> 13:24.671
Take it easy?
You almost got us both shot.

13:24.771 --> 13:26.539
I didn't know he was
gonna go that far.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.308
Who? That wasn't
some landlord!

13:28.408 --> 13:30.010
That was
a professional!

13:30.110 --> 13:32.179
The Lucero crime
family's after me.

13:32.279 --> 13:34.447
Lucero?
Are you kidding me?!

13:34.547 --> 13:36.716
I'll kill you before they do!
Okay, all right, all right!

13:36.816 --> 13:38.118
This is not gonna help.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.553
Why are the Luceros
after you?

13:40.653 --> 13:42.622
I was working

13:42.722 --> 13:44.892
as a dealer
at their underground casino.

13:44.992 --> 13:46.259
They think
I skimmed

13:46.359 --> 13:47.928
a little off the top,
that's all.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.329
Yeah, that means he did skim,

13:49.429 --> 13:50.563
and more
than a little.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.299
Ye of
little faith.
Oh, I got faith,

13:52.399 --> 13:54.467
just not in you!
Okay, enough.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.636
What does "a little" mean?

13:56.736 --> 13:58.238
Hypothetically?

13:58.338 --> 14:00.173
Yeah, sure.
Ten grand?

14:00.273 --> 14:02.209
Ten grand? You stole ten grand

14:02.309 --> 14:04.011
from the most dangerous
crime family in the city

14:04.111 --> 14:07.647
and decided to hide out at
my place without mentioning it?!

14:07.747 --> 14:09.282
I didn't want to
get you involved!

14:09.382 --> 14:11.084
I'd say I'm
pretty involved!

14:11.184 --> 14:13.553
I'm sorry, Anthony!

14:15.022 --> 14:17.557
I swear, on my mother,

14:17.657 --> 14:19.259
I will help make this up to you.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.028
You're damn right, you will.

14:21.128 --> 14:22.062
Who's the trigger man?

14:22.162 --> 14:23.196
Who's after you?
Anthony.

14:23.296 --> 14:24.797
It's not a trigger man.

14:26.066 --> 14:27.667
It's Leeroy Lucero himself.

14:27.767 --> 14:28.801
One of the sons.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.170
He runs
the casino,

14:30.270 --> 14:32.105
been trying to make
a name for himself.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.706
We've had him on
our radar for some time.

14:33.806 --> 14:36.343
Haven't been able
to make anything stick.

14:36.443 --> 14:38.912
Well, it's good that
we got a little minnow

14:39.012 --> 14:40.080
to use as bait.

14:43.050 --> 14:44.117
I'll have Isabella
come in and see

14:44.217 --> 14:45.418
if she can pick him
out of a lineup.

14:45.518 --> 14:46.853
That should be enough
for the D.A.'s office.

14:46.954 --> 14:48.121
Okay, I'll hide

14:48.221 --> 14:49.389
in the locker room
or something.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.024
Yep, makes sense.

14:51.124 --> 14:53.260
Okay, what's
that mean?
Nothing.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.494
Man, you're coming
really hard

14:54.594 --> 14:55.595
with the judgment
this week.

14:55.695 --> 14:56.763
Well, do you
realize you and Erik

14:56.863 --> 14:58.098
used the same words
to describe her?

14:58.198 --> 14:59.232
"Crazy." "Emotional."

14:59.332 --> 15:00.233
We're nothing alike.

15:00.333 --> 15:01.734
You sure
about that?

15:01.834 --> 15:03.436
I'd never
hit a woman, Eddie.
Yeah, I know that.

15:03.536 --> 15:04.404
And you got no idea
what happened

15:04.504 --> 15:05.438
between me and Isabella.

15:05.538 --> 15:06.806
Whatever you
did to her,

15:06.906 --> 15:08.641
that damage is gonna
last a lot longer

15:08.741 --> 15:10.077
than a mark
on her face.

15:10.177 --> 15:12.212
I'll skip the lecture,
thanks, Dr. Phil.

15:12.312 --> 15:13.280
Well, you should talk to her.

15:13.380 --> 15:14.948
Okay, how about this?

15:15.048 --> 15:17.684
I live my life the way I want
to, and you stay out of it.

15:17.784 --> 15:19.619
You men are such
stubborn idiots sometimes.

15:19.719 --> 15:21.188
And you women are always
concerned with relationships

15:21.288 --> 15:22.522
that aren't your own.

15:22.622 --> 15:23.957
I am trying to
help you out here, man.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.292
You need to grow up.

15:26.293 --> 15:27.427
You act like you've never been

15:27.527 --> 15:28.795
in a screwed-up
relationship before.

15:29.729 --> 15:31.631
Have you always been
this perfect little saint?

15:31.731 --> 15:32.699
Or maybe

15:32.799 --> 15:34.034
that's just what
you tell yourself

15:34.134 --> 15:35.535
because you married into
a family full of them.

15:36.403 --> 15:37.837
Yeah, since you married
Sergeant Flawless.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.372
You need to stop.

15:39.472 --> 15:40.540
Oh, that's what I thought.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.409
You can dish it out,

15:42.509 --> 15:44.677
but you can't take it.

15:46.879 --> 15:50.450
I can't get the exact
number, but a lot.

15:52.052 --> 15:55.155
But you can be more
exact than "a lot."

15:55.255 --> 15:58.058
Somewhere around twice a week

15:58.158 --> 16:00.560
the last couple of months.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.729
Mostly on weekends,
mostly nights.

16:02.829 --> 16:07.267
And is she courteous when she
plays Lenny's courtesy card?

16:07.367 --> 16:08.835
Yeah, mostly.

16:08.935 --> 16:10.103
But not a lot?

16:10.203 --> 16:12.572
There have been
a couple of incidences

16:12.672 --> 16:14.874
where she, uh, voiced
her displeasure

16:14.974 --> 16:17.944
at the way our officers
tried to unjam her.

16:18.045 --> 16:19.212
Like?

16:19.312 --> 16:20.480
Like making her
pay the tab

16:20.580 --> 16:21.881
that she tried to skate on,

16:21.981 --> 16:24.417
or bring back the merchandise
that she lifted.

16:26.819 --> 16:30.357
But the officers keep
giving her back the card.

16:30.457 --> 16:31.624
Most cops out there don't know

16:31.724 --> 16:33.626
who Detective Lenny Ross
is from Adam.

16:33.726 --> 16:36.363
But when she points out
who his old friend

16:36.463 --> 16:37.864
and former partner is,

16:37.964 --> 16:40.167
they let
her slide.

16:40.267 --> 16:42.835
So, dents on Lenny's
shield and mine?

16:42.935 --> 16:45.072
I wouldn't look at it
that way, boss.

16:45.172 --> 16:46.873
But I have to.

16:47.874 --> 16:50.510
In the most
discreet way possible,

16:50.610 --> 16:52.712
have her surrender the card.

16:53.513 --> 16:54.981
And thank you.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.217
You're up.

16:57.317 --> 16:59.386
I reached out to the top doc

16:59.486 --> 17:01.121
at the World Trade Center
Health Program.

17:01.221 --> 17:02.255
Pat Amato?

17:02.355 --> 17:04.524
Yes. Lenny Ross is under
his care.

17:05.792 --> 17:07.194
For?

17:07.294 --> 17:10.830
Well, HIPAA regulations
forbid any disclosure.

17:10.930 --> 17:12.299
Yeah, I know that,

17:12.399 --> 17:15.402
but you found a way
around it, right?

17:15.502 --> 17:17.637
I'll take that as a compliment.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.172
Amato said to tell you,

17:19.272 --> 17:24.344
"Inspector Bill Soames
and Lieutenant Janice Huff."

17:35.788 --> 17:38.525
He said you'd understand.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.396
Soames got mesothelioma,

17:43.496 --> 17:46.599
Huff got liver cancer.

17:48.868 --> 17:50.503
Whoa.

17:52.339 --> 17:53.573
You maybe want
to hit pause

17:53.673 --> 17:55.708
on pulling the kid's
courtesy card?

17:58.345 --> 18:00.380
Apples and oranges.

18:06.386 --> 18:08.020
All right, thank you.

18:08.121 --> 18:11.724
Got nothing from the delivery
service or the florist.

18:11.824 --> 18:13.326
We must be missing something.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.495
You really think it was him?

18:15.595 --> 18:17.464
When I looked into Sam's eyes,

18:17.564 --> 18:19.031
I saw the same man,

18:19.132 --> 18:20.467
the same monster.

18:20.567 --> 18:21.501
He hasn't changed,

18:21.601 --> 18:22.869
no matter what he says.

18:22.969 --> 18:25.772
He really got to you
back then, huh?

18:26.773 --> 18:29.476
It was one of
my first homicides.

18:29.576 --> 18:32.212
The... the body...

18:32.312 --> 18:35.215
It took dental
records to ID it.

18:35.315 --> 18:36.916
That's how
mutilated it was.

18:37.016 --> 18:38.785
I'll never get that
out of my head.

18:38.885 --> 18:40.887
You never do.

18:40.987 --> 18:42.655
Hey.

18:44.056 --> 18:45.825
You're sure you didn't
leave it open?

18:47.126 --> 18:48.195
No, don't go in.

18:48.295 --> 18:49.529
We'll be
right there.
What is it?

18:49.629 --> 18:50.630
My house, go.

19:03.276 --> 19:05.345
What happened?
When I came back,
I saw the door open.

19:05.445 --> 19:08.848
How long ago
did you get back?
Maybe ten minutes?

19:38.245 --> 19:40.146
Baez!

19:51.991 --> 19:53.760
Oh, my God.

20:03.736 --> 20:06.273
Okay, we're pulling
security footage

20:06.373 --> 20:07.674
from every camera on the block

20:07.774 --> 20:09.642
and running every single
print we can find.

20:09.742 --> 20:11.511
Well, they're not
gonna find a match,

20:11.611 --> 20:13.513
not with Sam.
He's too smart.

20:13.613 --> 20:15.782
Well, he didn't outsmart
you last time, did he?

20:15.882 --> 20:20.219
No, but...
he was here, Danny.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.454
He came for her.

20:21.554 --> 20:22.789
I know.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.291
Like, what if she'd been
here when he broke in?

20:24.391 --> 20:25.892
What if he'd taken her?

20:25.992 --> 20:28.861
You guys are safe now, okay?

20:28.961 --> 20:31.197
Just try not to worry.

20:31.298 --> 20:33.366
I just wanted
a better life for her,

20:33.466 --> 20:35.402
to protect her, and...

20:35.502 --> 20:39.238
instead, because of me,
this monster is after her.

20:39.339 --> 20:41.073
Okay, first
things first,

20:41.173 --> 20:43.209
it's not your fault. Okay?

20:43.310 --> 20:45.678
Second, we are not
gonna let anything

20:45.778 --> 20:47.514
happen to her
or you.

20:47.614 --> 20:48.981
I promise.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.450
Thanks, Danny.

20:50.550 --> 20:53.119
There'll be two RMPs
stationed outside

20:53.219 --> 20:54.687
around the clock, one out front,

20:54.787 --> 20:57.357
one in back, so he will
not dare show up here again.

21:00.727 --> 21:03.029
And I can... I can stay.

21:03.129 --> 21:04.731
If you want.

21:04.831 --> 21:06.499
I do.

21:06.599 --> 21:10.169
Okay, I'll crash here
on the couch

21:10.269 --> 21:11.704
and sleep with
one eye open.

21:11.804 --> 21:13.806
You guys have nothing
to worry about.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.476
Try and get
some rest.

21:16.576 --> 21:18.244
You, too.

21:34.026 --> 21:35.462
Uh-huh.

21:35.562 --> 21:37.664
Okay, what time was that?

21:38.865 --> 21:39.766
2:50.

21:39.866 --> 21:40.967
Okay, got it.

21:41.067 --> 21:43.536
Let me know if you hear
anything else.

21:43.636 --> 21:44.871
Thanks.

21:44.971 --> 21:47.807
Good morning.
You sleep well?

21:47.907 --> 21:49.241
Not really. You?

21:49.342 --> 21:51.344
Not a wink. Coffee?

21:51.444 --> 21:53.346
Yeah, please.

21:53.446 --> 21:55.147
Who was that?

21:55.247 --> 21:58.551
That was Sam Evans'
parole officer.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.387
Apparently, he removed
his ankle bracelet

22:00.487 --> 22:02.088
right before
the break-in.

22:02.188 --> 22:04.657
So now we have
no idea where he is.

22:04.757 --> 22:05.992
Not a clue.

22:06.092 --> 22:09.195
But the good news is,
when we do find him,

22:09.295 --> 22:10.597
now we can collar him.

22:10.697 --> 22:12.499
Any idea where he might be?

22:12.599 --> 22:15.001
He's, uh, supposedly
staying with his mom,

22:15.101 --> 22:16.268
so that's where I'm gonna start,

22:16.369 --> 22:17.470
see what she has to say.

22:17.570 --> 22:20.106
Uh, I can't leave Elena,

22:20.206 --> 22:21.974
not while he's still out there.

22:22.074 --> 22:23.376
No, I don't want you to.

22:23.476 --> 22:25.044
I'll call you as soon as
I hear anything from her,

22:25.144 --> 22:28.180
and if anything happens here,
please call me right away.

22:28.280 --> 22:30.282
I will. Okay.

22:48.367 --> 22:49.869
Yes?
Ms. Evans?

22:49.969 --> 22:52.338
My name's Detective Reagan.
Is your son home?

22:52.439 --> 22:53.806
No, he's not.

22:53.906 --> 22:55.542
Mind if I have a word?

23:00.647 --> 23:02.682
I'm not sure
how I can help.

23:02.782 --> 23:03.850
He isn't here.

23:03.950 --> 23:05.885
Uh, when's the last time
you saw him?

23:05.985 --> 23:07.520
Yesterday morning.

23:07.620 --> 23:09.121
And he didn't
stay here last night?

23:09.221 --> 23:10.857
No.

23:10.957 --> 23:13.292
Wh-What's going on?
Did he hurt someone?

23:13.392 --> 23:16.496
Would you be
surprised if he did?

23:18.865 --> 23:23.202
Must've been tough,
raising a son like Sam.

23:23.302 --> 23:25.404
When he got out,

23:25.505 --> 23:27.173
I wanted to turn him away,

23:27.273 --> 23:30.009
but he had no other place to go.

23:30.109 --> 23:33.045
I thought maybe his time
in prison might have...

23:33.145 --> 23:34.313
fixed him.

23:34.413 --> 23:38.150
He's been sending
flowers as a threat.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.586
Does that mean
anything to you?

23:39.686 --> 23:41.721
He always loved to mess
with people's heads.

23:41.821 --> 23:44.223
And he always
loved objects. Symbols.

23:44.323 --> 23:47.126
Symbols? Trophies? What?

23:47.226 --> 23:48.695
Yes.

23:50.597 --> 23:52.264
Hey, wanted to see me?

23:52.364 --> 23:56.569
Yeah, I wanted to speak to you
about the Lucero investigation.

23:56.669 --> 23:58.605
I think you need
to find another way

23:58.705 --> 24:00.873
to get him without
using your cousin Joey.

24:00.973 --> 24:02.208
But Joey's our way in.

24:02.308 --> 24:03.610
Yeah, and he's a huge liability,

24:03.710 --> 24:06.345
which he's proven
time and time again.

24:06.445 --> 24:07.747
Yeah, but if we do nothing,

24:07.847 --> 24:09.682
we're gonna find him shot
on the side of the road.

24:09.782 --> 24:11.518
Well, better him than you.

24:11.618 --> 24:14.420
Joey agreed to cooperate, Erin.

24:14.521 --> 24:15.988
Fool me once, shame on you.

24:16.088 --> 24:17.524
Fool me ten times,

24:17.624 --> 24:20.359
and you have
a serious blind spot

24:20.459 --> 24:21.661
when it comes
to your cousin.

24:21.761 --> 24:23.329
You know, you act
like you wouldn't do

24:23.429 --> 24:24.731
whatever it takes to
protect your family.

24:24.831 --> 24:28.234
My family are not ex-cons
working for the mob.

24:28.334 --> 24:29.435
Oh, really?

24:29.536 --> 24:32.404
Well, mine may not be perfect,

24:32.505 --> 24:33.472
but that doesn't mean

24:33.573 --> 24:35.708
I'm gonna turn my back on 'em.

24:48.888 --> 24:52.525
Francis, if he's
that sick,

24:52.625 --> 24:55.227
he's got every right
to an Irish exit.

24:55.327 --> 24:56.663
But it's me, Pop.

24:56.763 --> 24:59.231
We always check in and
check out on each other.

24:59.331 --> 25:02.501
And he had dinner with you
just the other night.

25:02.602 --> 25:05.672
Yeah, when I was in the dark.

25:05.772 --> 25:07.874
Yeah, but that's
his right, too.

25:07.974 --> 25:09.576
Lot of guys would
rather be remembered

25:09.676 --> 25:12.879
for their last good time
than their sad farewell.

25:12.979 --> 25:17.216
But it isn't that either.
I mean, he just bolted.

25:17.316 --> 25:19.085
To help out his daughter.

25:21.220 --> 25:22.922
It isn't about you.

25:23.022 --> 25:24.991
But it is.

25:26.258 --> 25:28.127
It has to be.

25:29.395 --> 25:31.197
The ones we care about most

25:31.297 --> 25:33.733
deserve more than an Irish exit.

25:35.001 --> 25:37.169
Earned more.

25:37.269 --> 25:39.471
To say what?

25:41.140 --> 25:42.709
I don't know.

25:42.809 --> 25:45.077
Is there a clock on this thing?

25:47.379 --> 25:50.817
Well, a calendar anyway.

25:52.551 --> 25:55.387
That's a real double-whammy,
what he's got.

26:00.292 --> 26:01.961
Is he still here?

26:02.061 --> 26:03.696
I don't even know.

26:03.796 --> 26:06.866
You have an army
under your command.

26:06.966 --> 26:09.568
They can find him
if you want.

26:09.669 --> 26:12.104
He knows I'm trying
to reach him.

26:13.305 --> 26:15.975
If he doesn't
want to be found...

26:17.744 --> 26:20.479
I have to respect that.

26:22.481 --> 26:24.717
Yeah.

26:29.288 --> 26:31.791
I'm sure that was him. 100%.

26:31.891 --> 26:33.359
Well, then
we're done here.

26:33.459 --> 26:34.761
I spoke to
the D.A.'s office.

26:34.861 --> 26:36.663
They're gonna do
everything they can.

26:36.763 --> 26:38.530
God, this week has
been such a whirlwind.

26:38.631 --> 26:40.499
I feel like I owe you
in more ways than one.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.201
What do you mean?

26:42.301 --> 26:43.636
Luis and I talked.

26:43.736 --> 26:45.638
It was the first
real conversation

26:45.738 --> 26:47.173
we've had since we dated.

26:47.273 --> 26:50.442
Maybe even the first real
conversation we've ever had.

26:50.542 --> 26:52.011
And he came to talk to you?

26:52.111 --> 26:53.512
Yeah, we're not
getting back together

26:53.612 --> 26:55.447
or anything like that.
Not a chance.

26:55.547 --> 26:57.984
But I feel a lot better

26:58.084 --> 27:00.619
about finally getting
some things answered.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.722
I feel less used.

27:02.822 --> 27:03.890
Hmm.

27:03.990 --> 27:05.491
I thought he was
the love of my life.

27:05.591 --> 27:07.760
You know? Seems so silly now.

27:07.860 --> 27:09.996
Oh, I-I've been there.

27:10.096 --> 27:11.297
I know how it feels.

27:11.397 --> 27:13.532
Anyway, I know why
he came to talk to me,

27:13.632 --> 27:17.136
so thank you for everything.

27:25.511 --> 27:27.079
Hey, Danny.

27:27.179 --> 27:29.048
You guys okay?

27:29.148 --> 27:31.417
Yeah, we're good.
Did you find anything?

27:31.517 --> 27:33.219
Maybe. I-I spoke
to Sam's mother,

27:33.319 --> 27:35.621
who said he has
a thing for trophies.

27:35.722 --> 27:37.123
And I may have found a trophy.

27:37.223 --> 27:38.925
Really? What is it?

27:39.025 --> 27:40.426
The guy that Sam
murdered had a house

27:40.526 --> 27:41.828
that he left to his family.

27:41.928 --> 27:44.430
A few months back
they sold it, but get this,

27:44.530 --> 27:46.532
it was purchased all cash

27:46.632 --> 27:47.599
by an anonymous buyer.

27:47.700 --> 27:48.968
You think Sam bought it?

27:49.068 --> 27:51.070
It's a theory,
but I got to check it out.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.038
What's the address?

27:52.138 --> 27:55.574
544 Monroe Street in Queens.

27:55.674 --> 27:56.642
Got it.
No, hey.

27:56.743 --> 27:57.676
Don't even think about

27:57.777 --> 27:59.145
going there.

28:00.012 --> 28:02.782
Maria, wait!

28:14.026 --> 28:16.428
Come on, Maria, pick up.

28:48.660 --> 28:49.762
Baez?

28:53.232 --> 28:54.400
What's going
on, partner?

28:54.500 --> 28:56.668
I don't want you
to be a part of this.

28:58.737 --> 29:00.006
Okay.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.975
Why don't you take your
finger off that trigger

29:03.075 --> 29:04.643
and let me put
the cuffs on him?

29:05.411 --> 29:07.246
I can't let him
walk out of here.

29:07.346 --> 29:09.048
He'll be walking
into a prison cell.

29:09.148 --> 29:10.950
Look at his computer.

29:12.284 --> 29:13.820
I see it.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.321
I can't let him hurt her.

29:15.421 --> 29:17.323
He's not going to.

29:17.423 --> 29:18.891
Come on, this ain't the way.

29:18.991 --> 29:21.093
Listen to your partner, Detective.

29:21.193 --> 29:22.761
Shut up!

29:23.529 --> 29:25.531
Hey, hey, hey.

29:25.631 --> 29:26.532
Relax.

29:26.632 --> 29:28.200
Relax, okay?
Don't do this.

29:28.300 --> 29:29.668
Just take your finger
off the trigger

29:29.768 --> 29:31.403
and lower the weapon, all right?

29:31.503 --> 29:32.939
You don't want to
end up in prison

29:33.039 --> 29:34.673
for the rest of your life
over this piece of crap.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.608
I do if that's what it takes.

29:36.708 --> 29:38.444
Listen to me.

29:38.544 --> 29:41.680
Don't do this.

29:42.448 --> 29:43.549
Lower the gun.

29:43.649 --> 29:45.584
What do you
got me on?

29:45.684 --> 29:49.488
Parole violation? Stalking?

29:49.588 --> 29:50.890
I won't be in for long.

29:50.990 --> 29:52.358
Shut your mouth.

29:53.392 --> 29:56.395
Just think about the people
who love you, okay?

29:56.495 --> 29:58.697
Think about
your family.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.299
Okay?

30:00.399 --> 30:02.969
Your daughter can't
make it without you.

30:04.770 --> 30:07.039
Neither can I.

30:10.576 --> 30:13.579
Just lower it, please.

30:19.118 --> 30:21.988
Just cover him while
I put the cuffs on.

30:24.991 --> 30:26.458
Turn over.

30:27.259 --> 30:28.861
Give me your hand.

30:42.208 --> 30:43.209
When you
see Leeroy,

30:43.309 --> 30:44.676
hand him the
duffel of cash,

30:44.776 --> 30:47.279
tell him you got more
coming next week.

30:47.379 --> 30:49.415
Once you're
in the clear,

30:49.515 --> 30:51.884
I'll move in
with ESU.

30:51.984 --> 30:53.752
Look, Anthony...

30:55.787 --> 30:57.023
I'm sorry
I lied to you.

30:57.123 --> 30:59.558
I really didn't mean
to drag you into all this.

30:59.658 --> 31:02.628
I want you to know,
whatever happens...

31:04.530 --> 31:05.564
I appreciate everything

31:05.664 --> 31:07.599
you've done for me
over the years.

31:10.136 --> 31:11.370
Just stick
to the plan,

31:11.470 --> 31:12.905
everything'll
be fine.

31:14.406 --> 31:15.874
You ready?

31:20.947 --> 31:22.348
Yeah.

31:22.448 --> 31:24.416
Good luck.
You can do this.

31:38.597 --> 31:40.832
Hi, I'm Joey.
I'm here to see Leeroy.

31:46.272 --> 31:48.407
Excuse me.

32:00.586 --> 32:02.221
Joey Ruscoli.

32:02.321 --> 32:04.856
Scared you to your senses, huh?

32:04.957 --> 32:07.960
Hey, Leeroy. Good to see you.

32:08.060 --> 32:10.196
Uh, got that money
we talked about.

32:10.296 --> 32:11.597
Oh, I know you do.

32:11.697 --> 32:15.001
Either that
or you have a death wish.

32:15.101 --> 32:16.235
That's a good one.

32:16.335 --> 32:18.337
Always with the
jokes, this guy.

32:18.437 --> 32:20.706
Anyway, here's the money.

32:24.110 --> 32:25.711
Ten.

32:25.811 --> 32:29.181
Ten? You said you had
five more in interest.

32:29.281 --> 32:31.083
Right, but I said I would
bring that next week.

32:31.183 --> 32:32.151
Didn't I say that?

32:32.251 --> 32:34.620
It was 15 this week, ten next.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.455
I-I-I must've got mixed up.

32:36.555 --> 32:38.057
Look, I promise you,

32:38.157 --> 32:40.759
I will get you that money.
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

32:40.859 --> 32:42.128
What are you doing,
Leeroy? Come on.

32:42.228 --> 32:45.031
I guess you had
a death wish after all.

32:45.131 --> 32:46.832
Boss.

32:48.267 --> 32:49.201
Who's this?

32:49.301 --> 32:50.536
Detective Abetemarco.

32:50.636 --> 32:52.271
20 years NYPD,

32:52.371 --> 32:53.672
12 years an investigator

32:53.772 --> 32:55.774
with the Manhattan
D.A.'s office,

32:55.874 --> 32:58.110
and the last guy
you want to screw with.

32:58.210 --> 33:00.212
You, back off.

33:03.649 --> 33:05.851
Wow. The balls on you.

33:05.951 --> 33:08.887
This piece of crap
is my cousin Joey.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.256
Check his jacket.
He tried to pocket

33:10.356 --> 33:11.290
some of
your money.

33:11.390 --> 33:13.192
Anthony.

33:16.395 --> 33:17.363
Ah.

33:17.463 --> 33:19.031
Okay.

33:22.034 --> 33:23.802
He's still short the juice.

33:23.902 --> 33:25.471
He's gonna work
the rest of it off.

33:25.571 --> 33:26.572
I am?

33:26.672 --> 33:28.074
Yeah. And you're
gonna employ him

33:28.174 --> 33:29.875
till his debt's all paid,

33:29.975 --> 33:31.477
or I'm going to have
ESU come down here

33:31.577 --> 33:34.180
and bust up
your whole operation.

33:34.280 --> 33:37.349
I'll arrest everyone from
your blackjack dealers to you.

33:37.449 --> 33:40.486
Well, you've got nothing on me.
Nothing that'll stick.

33:40.586 --> 33:41.820
That may be true,

33:41.920 --> 33:43.355
but I bet you got a lot of cash

33:43.455 --> 33:44.823
stashed around this place.

33:44.923 --> 33:46.592
My guys come in here,

33:46.692 --> 33:47.826
you're gonna lose a lot more

33:47.926 --> 33:49.295
than what Joey
here shorted you.

33:54.233 --> 33:58.837
Well, Mr. Ruscoli, looks
like you got yourself a job.

34:00.206 --> 34:01.873
Now, if I find out
anything happens to him...

34:01.973 --> 34:04.743
Don't worry. He'll have
health care and pension.

34:04.843 --> 34:06.945
Anthony, you can't

34:07.045 --> 34:08.480
leave me with
these people.

34:08.580 --> 34:10.816
Please. They're animals.

34:11.717 --> 34:14.186
Then you should
feel right at home.

34:28.066 --> 34:29.468
Will Gabriel.

34:29.568 --> 34:30.636
Huh?

34:30.736 --> 34:32.070
He was a guy I dated.

34:32.171 --> 34:34.806
We were supposed to go
on vacation in the Caribbean.

34:34.906 --> 34:37.509
I thought it was his plan
to propose to me,

34:37.609 --> 34:40.078
but when I showed up
down there to meet him,

34:40.179 --> 34:42.748
I found out he'd
canceled his flight.

34:42.848 --> 34:43.882
I called and called,

34:43.982 --> 34:46.585
but I never heard
from him again.

34:47.786 --> 34:49.421
Why are you telling me all this?

34:49.521 --> 34:51.390
I heard you spoke to Isabella.

34:51.490 --> 34:53.225
Oh.

34:53.325 --> 34:55.093
Yeah, I did.

34:55.194 --> 34:56.428
And?

34:56.528 --> 34:57.663
Nice.

34:57.763 --> 34:59.498
It was nice?
That's it? It was nice?

34:59.598 --> 35:01.500
Okay, I was wrong.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.135
You were... right.

35:03.235 --> 35:04.636
You happy?

35:04.736 --> 35:06.938
What made you change your mind?

35:07.038 --> 35:09.375
Advice from
someone I trust,

35:09.475 --> 35:11.109
who's in a marriage I admire.

35:11.210 --> 35:13.179
I just puked
in my mouth a little.

35:13.279 --> 35:14.880
Yeah.

35:16.615 --> 35:18.250
I don't like it, you know.

35:18.350 --> 35:19.418
Hmm?

35:19.518 --> 35:21.287
Being single,
dating around.

35:22.654 --> 35:23.789
I'd like to find
the right one,

35:23.889 --> 35:26.192
but I just
haven't yet.

35:26.292 --> 35:28.760
You'll find your
Sergeant Flawless one day.

35:28.860 --> 35:30.796
Ooh, don't know
about "Flawless".

35:30.896 --> 35:32.398
Well, opposites attract, right?

35:32.498 --> 35:33.599
Wow.

35:33.699 --> 35:34.700
Okay, why don't you meet me

35:34.800 --> 35:37.836
at King's Crown after work?

35:37.936 --> 35:40.472
It's been a minute since
I got to play wingwoman.

35:40.572 --> 35:41.940
I'll buy.

35:42.040 --> 35:43.909
Yeah, you will.

35:47.846 --> 35:49.915
Brought you some takeout.

35:50.015 --> 35:51.783
You didn't have to do that.

35:51.883 --> 35:53.552
Of course I did.
Where's Elena?

35:53.652 --> 35:55.086
I just
put her down.

35:56.422 --> 35:57.989
You doing okay?

35:58.957 --> 36:01.627
I don't know.

36:01.727 --> 36:04.263
The way I reacted.

36:04.363 --> 36:07.699
I almost shot him, Danny.
I really did.

36:07.799 --> 36:10.202
I know. I thought
you were going to.

36:11.803 --> 36:13.872
I don't know what
I was thinking.

36:13.972 --> 36:16.975
Maybe I'm not
cut out to be a mom.

36:17.075 --> 36:18.477
The last week
has proven that you are

36:18.577 --> 36:20.879
more than cut out to be a mom.

36:20.979 --> 36:23.081
You're just saying that.
No, I'm not.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.351
If I was in your shoes,
I would've done the same thing

36:25.451 --> 36:27.253
or probably worse.

36:27.353 --> 36:29.855
Maybe we've spent
too much time together.

36:29.955 --> 36:31.690
Yeah, probably.

36:32.691 --> 36:33.992
I spoke to the D.A.'s office.

36:34.092 --> 36:36.094
They're gonna push
for maximum sentencing.

36:36.194 --> 36:39.598
And if this guy ever does
see the light of day again,

36:39.698 --> 36:41.267
we'll be ready for him.

36:42.234 --> 36:43.402
Thanks, Danny.

36:43.502 --> 36:45.404
For everything this week.

36:45.504 --> 36:47.939
I don't know what I would have
done if you weren't here.

36:48.039 --> 36:51.142
You would've handled
your business.

36:52.611 --> 36:54.313
Enjoy your food.

36:54.413 --> 36:57.082
Stay for dinner?

36:58.550 --> 37:01.320
I can't eat all this by myself.

37:01.420 --> 37:03.255
I'd love to.

37:05.090 --> 37:06.492
Grab us some drinks?

37:06.592 --> 37:08.059
You got beer
in the fridge?

37:08.159 --> 37:10.396
Tequila on the shelf.

37:11.497 --> 37:13.732
Tequila on the shelf it is.

37:17.736 --> 37:19.538
Bless us, O Lord,

37:19.638 --> 37:20.939
and these, Thy gifts,

37:21.039 --> 37:22.040
which we are about to
receive from Thy bounty.

37:22.140 --> 37:23.942
Through Christ, our Lord. Amen.

37:24.042 --> 37:25.944
Uncle Jamie, what is up

37:26.044 --> 37:27.646
with the shirt?
See?

37:27.746 --> 37:30.248
Yeah, did you just come back
from an island or something?

37:30.349 --> 37:31.483
Yes, actually.

37:31.583 --> 37:33.419
I went to a college
friend's bachelor party

37:33.519 --> 37:34.753
in the Caribbean this week.

37:34.853 --> 37:36.822
Oh, you're still
going to those?
Yeah.

37:36.922 --> 37:38.357
Second marriage or third?

37:38.457 --> 37:39.558
Second.

37:40.626 --> 37:41.760
I asked him to change it,

37:41.860 --> 37:43.028
trust me.

37:43.128 --> 37:44.663
Hey, I came straight
from the airport.

37:44.763 --> 37:46.532
Which still doesn't excuse that.

37:47.833 --> 37:48.967
I think it's stylish.

37:49.067 --> 37:50.736
Case in point. Hey.

37:50.836 --> 37:51.737
Hey, don't knock it.

37:51.837 --> 37:53.204
You have fun?

37:53.305 --> 37:54.005
Yeah.

37:54.105 --> 37:55.040
Hmm, how much fun?

37:55.140 --> 37:57.476
It was very relaxing, actually.

37:57.576 --> 37:59.511
We were all in bed every
night before 9:00 p.m.

37:59.611 --> 38:00.546
Oh, right.

38:00.646 --> 38:01.747
9:00 p.m.

38:01.847 --> 38:02.848
A likely story.

38:02.948 --> 38:04.082
I'm serious.

38:04.182 --> 38:05.651
You guys
get food poisoning or something?

38:05.751 --> 38:09.120
No, we're just all in our 40s
now and value our sleep.

38:09.220 --> 38:11.457
Are you buying
any of this?

38:11.557 --> 38:12.991
Actually, yes.

38:13.091 --> 38:15.661
I'm telling the truth.
We fished, we ate, we slept.

38:15.761 --> 38:17.763
Hey, what more could you need?

38:17.863 --> 38:20.666
You ever come back from
a bachelor party by 9:00 p.m.?

38:20.766 --> 38:24.302
You bet, absolutely. 8:00 p.m.
Right after calling Mary.

38:24.403 --> 38:26.605
What? You're both liars.

38:26.705 --> 38:28.006
What about that time
I picked up you

38:28.106 --> 38:29.508
and all your friends
from the Sapphire club

38:29.608 --> 38:31.410
and took you to eat fast
food at 3:00 in the morning?

38:31.510 --> 38:33.745
I thought we agreed to
never speak about that.

38:33.845 --> 38:35.781
Uh...

38:35.881 --> 38:37.248
Statute of limitations.

38:37.349 --> 38:38.784
Mm-hmm, and you don't
think I have collateral?

38:38.884 --> 38:40.486
'Cause the stories
I could tell...

38:40.586 --> 38:43.489
Okay, what happens at a bachelor
or bachelorette party

38:43.589 --> 38:45.190
stays there. Amen.

38:45.290 --> 38:46.958
Unless you cross the line,
'cause I'd kill you.

38:48.660 --> 38:52.097
Well, nobody in this family
would ever cross the line.

38:52.197 --> 38:55.000
Or let their friends
cross the line,

38:55.100 --> 38:56.234
hard as they might try.

38:56.334 --> 38:58.437
Oh, yeah,
it's not worth the risk.

38:58.537 --> 39:00.906
I mean I don't understand
the whole tradition,

39:01.006 --> 39:02.340
just the liability.

39:02.441 --> 39:04.009
For me, I hadn't seen these
guys in a lot of years.

39:04.109 --> 39:06.478
It was just nice to catch up
before the actual wedding.

39:06.578 --> 39:09.214
Yeah, you pick up right
where you left off?

39:09.314 --> 39:10.949
Yeah.

39:11.049 --> 39:13.084
That sounds more like a no.

39:13.184 --> 39:16.321
No, we did, it's just,
after a few days,

39:16.422 --> 39:18.624
you can't really
pretend you're all

39:18.724 --> 39:20.291
still back in college.
There's a distance

39:20.392 --> 39:23.261
between who we were
and who we are,

39:23.361 --> 39:25.230
no matter how hard
you pretend.

39:26.998 --> 39:29.501
Sometimes those cracks
are hard to ignore.

39:29.601 --> 39:32.003
They'll swallow you whole
if you let 'em.

39:33.071 --> 39:34.372
What do you mean?

39:34.473 --> 39:38.143
People come and go
and come again in life.

39:38.243 --> 39:39.945
You can't worry
about the gaps in time.

39:40.045 --> 39:41.212
All you can
worry about

39:41.312 --> 39:44.182
is the time that
you have with them.

39:44.282 --> 39:47.619
And as you get older,
the more you realize

39:47.719 --> 39:52.223
that making the most of
that time is all that matters.

40:07.205 --> 40:08.574
You had me followed again?

40:08.674 --> 40:12.210
Dr. Amato is an old
and trusted friend.

40:12.310 --> 40:13.344
Well, even
if he wasn't,

40:13.445 --> 40:15.481
New York's top cop
can squeeze him.

40:15.581 --> 40:17.182
That, too.

40:17.282 --> 40:19.417
Took away
my daughter's courtesy card.

40:19.518 --> 40:20.686
That really hurt.

40:20.786 --> 40:22.654
Hurt me, too.

40:22.754 --> 40:25.156
But she was using it
like it was an EZ pass.

40:25.256 --> 40:26.692
Well, she's having a hard time.

40:26.792 --> 40:30.462
What, with her old man
having a worse time?

40:33.932 --> 40:35.166
So you know.

40:37.102 --> 40:38.637
Look, Frank, I'm not
asking you for anything.

40:38.737 --> 40:39.871
I didn't say you were.

40:39.971 --> 40:41.106
Then why are you here?

40:41.206 --> 40:44.009
Well, I tried to
respect your request

40:44.109 --> 40:47.278
to be left alone, but I failed.

40:47.378 --> 40:49.247
I didn't have it in me.

40:51.016 --> 40:52.984
I brought you something.

40:59.024 --> 41:01.326
This is your courtesy card.

41:02.227 --> 41:05.230
With my cell phone number
and my direct office line.

41:06.732 --> 41:08.299
Please see that she gets it.

41:08.399 --> 41:11.537
You're gonna regret this.

41:13.038 --> 41:15.907
Not if I can pitch
in when you're...

41:16.007 --> 41:17.743
Taking the dirt nap?

41:17.843 --> 41:21.146
I was gonna say out of town.

41:22.147 --> 41:23.749
Well...

41:23.849 --> 41:25.651
I'll give it to her,

41:25.751 --> 41:27.886
with some guidelines.

41:27.986 --> 41:29.521
That'd be good.

41:33.091 --> 41:34.392
And thank you.

41:36.628 --> 41:38.229
Where you going?

41:38.329 --> 41:40.666
Nowhere in particular.

41:40.766 --> 41:42.300
Flight's not till tonight.

41:42.400 --> 41:44.069
Hmm.

41:44.169 --> 41:45.704
Well, I cleared my afternoon,

41:45.804 --> 41:48.039
just in case you quit
being such a jerk.

41:49.708 --> 41:52.277
You want to do something?

41:54.780 --> 41:56.582
Yeah, sure.

41:57.816 --> 41:59.350
Lights and sirens?

42:01.186 --> 42:02.487
Where we going?

42:03.655 --> 42:04.990
I don't know yet,

42:05.090 --> 42:08.594
but wherever it is,
I want to go loud and fast.
