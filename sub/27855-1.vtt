00:41.142 --> 00:43.777
(woman panting)

01:03.731 --> 01:04.665
- Excuse me.

01:04.665 --> 01:05.999
You can't be sleeping here.

01:08.669 --> 01:09.837
- I'm sorry.

01:09.837 --> 01:10.671
I was just leaving.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.807
- [Woman] Don't leave your
shit here, everywhere.

01:14.875 --> 01:16.810
My kids play here you know.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.779
- Hey, hey.

01:19.713 --> 01:20.614
Your shoelace.

01:22.516 --> 01:25.419
(melancholy music)

01:38.632 --> 01:39.800
Hey it's me.

01:42.102 --> 01:42.936
I'm okay, I just,

01:44.405 --> 01:46.174
I might need to stay with
you for a little while.

01:48.409 --> 01:49.210
Probably Friday.

01:52.280 --> 01:53.847
Okay.

01:53.847 --> 01:55.816
I'll call you, you won't
be able to reach me.

01:59.086 --> 01:59.920
Okay, bye.

02:04.692 --> 02:07.195
(sighs)

02:07.195 --> 02:10.130
(melancholy music)

02:50.671 --> 02:52.206
(horn blares)

02:52.206 --> 02:53.941
I didn't do anything.

03:06.654 --> 03:08.489
- Where you heading?

03:08.489 --> 03:10.824
- South, as far as I can go.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.663
- Lit motherfucker.

03:15.663 --> 03:16.930
- Hmm-mm.

03:16.930 --> 03:18.899
He means we're going
in that direction.

03:20.100 --> 03:21.802
- That'll work thanks.

03:24.104 --> 03:25.573
- So like what you
doing down south?

03:26.674 --> 03:27.575
Do you live there?

03:29.377 --> 03:30.611
- No.

03:30.611 --> 03:32.846
- Oh so you live here?

03:32.846 --> 03:34.415
- [Zoe] Not really.

03:34.415 --> 03:35.249
- Okay.

03:38.352 --> 03:41.154
(laughs) You're a
really talkative cookie.

03:42.323 --> 03:43.557
(laughing)

03:43.557 --> 03:45.426
- [Driver] Hey relax,
we're just playing.

03:47.761 --> 03:50.197
(rock music)

03:57.271 --> 03:59.106
* Such a pretty one

03:59.106 --> 04:00.508
* Such a little one

04:00.508 --> 04:02.976
* Oh my God

04:02.976 --> 04:04.412
* Little biddy girl

04:04.412 --> 04:06.013
* Got an ass that's fine

04:06.013 --> 04:08.382
* Hand of God

04:08.382 --> 04:10.217
* Little biddy girl

04:10.217 --> 04:11.952
* Got an ass that's fine

04:11.952 --> 04:14.588
* Oh my god

04:14.588 --> 04:16.156
* Such a pretty one

04:16.156 --> 04:18.426
* Such a little one

04:18.426 --> 04:20.560
* Hand of God

04:20.560 --> 04:21.995
- I appreciate the lift.

04:21.995 --> 04:24.532
- [Passenger] Yeah the
beach is right up that way.

04:24.532 --> 04:26.434
Just go across.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.001
- Yep I see it, thanks.

04:30.170 --> 04:32.673
(locks click)

04:39.413 --> 04:41.549
- It just takes a magic touch.

04:41.549 --> 04:42.650
- Thanks man.

04:50.724 --> 04:54.127
(melancholy dance music)

06:04.998 --> 06:07.735
(birds sqawking)

06:33.861 --> 06:36.697
(distant singing)

06:40.568 --> 06:42.335
- I hope you like peanut
butter sandwiches.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.005
- What?

06:45.005 --> 06:46.507
- Yeah, they were all
out of grilled cheeses

06:46.507 --> 06:47.875
so I had to get a fricking
peanut butter sandwich.

06:49.443 --> 06:50.978
- Oh I'm okay thanks.

06:50.978 --> 06:52.179
- Don't be embarrassed

06:52.179 --> 06:53.380
I'm just doing my
good deed for the day.

06:59.753 --> 07:00.888
Never mind just keep it.

07:04.224 --> 07:05.058
- Wait.

07:07.327 --> 07:08.161
Thank you.

07:09.362 --> 07:10.197
- It's all good.

07:12.633 --> 07:13.734
- You want half?

07:13.734 --> 07:14.568
- Yeah thank you.

07:22.075 --> 07:23.544
So do you live around here?

07:25.278 --> 07:26.146
- No, not really.

07:27.414 --> 07:28.381
- Oh just visiting?

07:30.751 --> 07:31.585
- Sorta.

07:33.053 --> 07:33.887
- Hmm.

07:35.088 --> 07:37.491
Is everything like
all good with you?

07:37.491 --> 07:38.325
- Yeah.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.894
Just having a rough day I guess.

07:49.269 --> 07:50.370
- So who are you?

07:51.238 --> 07:54.207
- I'm Kate.

07:54.207 --> 07:55.676
- Hmm nice, Silver.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.382
(clears throat)

08:02.382 --> 08:04.451
I'm sorry, there's nuts
in this peanut butter,

08:04.451 --> 08:05.285
it's so shitty.

08:08.822 --> 08:11.659
So do you like live
on the streets?

08:11.659 --> 08:12.492
- Yeah.

08:15.763 --> 08:16.597
- That's so cool.

08:18.899 --> 08:20.300
- I guess you could say that.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.603
- Although there is
some crazy motherfuckers

08:22.603 --> 08:24.772
on these streets, you
gotta watch yourself.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.080
Hmm, yeah, I should probably
get back to my board

08:33.080 --> 08:34.181
before it gets jacked but--

08:34.181 --> 08:35.215
- Yeah of course.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.118
Thanks again for this.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.285
- I'm sure I'll
see you around so.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.087
I'll see you.

08:41.087 --> 08:43.023
- Probably not actually.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.524
I'm getting out of here tonight.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.693
- [Silver] Oh where to?

08:48.562 --> 08:49.396
- Mexico.

08:50.263 --> 08:52.132
- [Silver] Without money?

08:53.366 --> 08:55.402
- I'll probably just
hitch or something.

08:56.303 --> 08:57.805
- (laughs) As in like?

09:00.040 --> 09:01.742
Okay, I don't know what
streets you're from

09:01.742 --> 09:04.211
but that's like definitely
not a thing around here.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.246
- Well maybe I'll get lucky.

09:06.246 --> 09:08.248
- Maybe, but don't
tell yourself it's fate

09:08.248 --> 09:09.850
when some nasty
pervert in a rape van

09:09.850 --> 09:12.485
pulls over and just happens
to be heading to Mexico too.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.357
Well, if you need anything,

09:17.357 --> 09:21.428
I park my bus in a
alley up near Main.

09:21.428 --> 09:24.765
It's like a big VW, white
camper thing, you can't miss it.

09:24.765 --> 09:26.867
So just yell out if
you need anything.

09:27.768 --> 09:29.102
- Thanks.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.537
- [Silver] Peace.

09:39.847 --> 09:42.750
(melancholy music)

11:04.865 --> 11:07.935
(footsteps clicking)

11:24.818 --> 11:27.821
(suspenseful music)

11:33.994 --> 11:35.996
(gasps)

11:37.264 --> 11:39.867
(wind howling)

11:52.312 --> 11:55.382
(distant rock music)

12:22.175 --> 12:27.180
* Doesn't really
matter how hard I try *

12:29.016 --> 12:34.021
* All of these things you
do and I don't know why *

12:34.922 --> 12:38.125
* You're just gonna save me

12:38.125 --> 12:38.959
- Kate.

12:38.959 --> 12:39.793
Hey Kate!

12:42.362 --> 12:43.330
- Oh hey.

12:43.330 --> 12:45.198
- Holy damn that was so creepy.

12:45.198 --> 12:46.533
I saw someone outside my window

12:46.533 --> 12:47.868
and I was like what the hell?

12:47.868 --> 12:50.137
- [Kate] Sorry, I wasn't
sure if it was yours.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.306
- Alright well don't
just stand there.

12:54.674 --> 12:55.475
Get inside.

12:58.678 --> 12:59.579
Come on, you coming or what?

13:05.652 --> 13:08.388
Lucky for you I just stocked up.

13:08.388 --> 13:09.890
- I'm good, thanks though.

13:13.260 --> 13:16.296
- So let me guess, you
couldn't hitch a ride,

13:16.296 --> 13:18.065
like I said you couldn't.

13:18.065 --> 13:20.467
And now you need
a place to crash.

13:20.467 --> 13:23.136
- No I was just gonna
crash on the beach.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.571
- [Silver] So why didn't you?

13:25.805 --> 13:26.639
- The tide.

13:28.075 --> 13:29.409
Yeah it was way too high.

13:29.409 --> 13:30.243
- Right (laughs).

13:31.344 --> 13:32.345
- Yeah it was weird.

13:34.547 --> 13:35.448
- Okay whatever.

13:36.884 --> 13:39.619
You're welcome to stay here,
I'm just breaking your balls.

13:39.619 --> 13:40.854
It's only cool though

13:40.854 --> 13:41.788
if you promise to
cook in the morning.

13:41.788 --> 13:43.523
I'm so not a morning person.

13:45.425 --> 13:46.659
Ooh.

13:46.659 --> 13:47.727
- Thanks I should
probably find a ride

13:47.727 --> 13:49.229
before morning anyways.

13:49.229 --> 13:50.563
- [Silver] What's the rush?

13:52.132 --> 13:54.767
- I just, I have
somewhere I need to be.

13:54.767 --> 13:56.136
- Somewhere you need to be.

13:57.404 --> 13:58.371
Sounds sketchy.

14:02.375 --> 14:04.511
Okay, if you wanna kick
it in my van for a while,

14:04.511 --> 14:05.745
that's fine.

14:05.745 --> 14:07.514
But I do have a no
bullshit policy so,

14:08.648 --> 14:09.749
just spit it out babe.

14:13.786 --> 14:15.855
- My brother's down in Mexico

14:15.855 --> 14:17.991
and I'm going to stay
with him for a while.

14:17.991 --> 14:22.195
- [Silver] Okay, so
what's your deal?

14:22.195 --> 14:24.864
- There's no deal,
I don't have a deal.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.066
- You're living on the streets

14:26.066 --> 14:27.434
and now you wanna
skip town at 2:00 a.m.

14:27.434 --> 14:29.302
to go visit your
brother in Mexico.

14:29.302 --> 14:31.604
Yeah I'd say you
100% have a deal.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.173
- Look, I can just go.

14:33.173 --> 14:35.808
- No, I didn't mean to
pry, I'm just curious.

14:40.347 --> 14:41.581
- It's not that fucked up,

14:41.581 --> 14:44.217
I just got into some
trouble you know.

14:45.152 --> 14:46.419
- Like what?

14:46.419 --> 14:47.620
Looting houses?

14:52.059 --> 14:53.360
Damn I'm good.

14:55.462 --> 14:56.463
- I just need to
lay low for a while.

14:56.463 --> 14:57.664
Let all this blow over.

14:59.066 --> 15:00.433
- Sounds pretty scary.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.303
I guess I should
watch out for you.

15:05.372 --> 15:07.140
- No, just for your
stuff (laughs).

15:08.308 --> 15:10.610
- Okay well, if you're
gonna crash here

15:10.610 --> 15:12.980
I should probably at
least know your real name.

15:16.583 --> 15:17.384
- I'm Zoe.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.254
- Hey Zoe.

15:22.990 --> 15:24.457
Do you hear that?

15:24.457 --> 15:25.292
- [Zoe] What?

15:26.559 --> 15:28.528
- Close your eyes
and just listen.

15:34.434 --> 15:37.204
(waves crashing)

15:50.650 --> 15:53.653
(crickets chirping)

16:01.428 --> 16:03.430
(gasps)

16:19.346 --> 16:22.282
(melancholy music)

16:47.574 --> 16:50.510
(cutlery clinking)

16:51.444 --> 16:54.947
(siren blaring distantly)

17:06.659 --> 17:09.195
No I'm not gonna
fucking apologize.

17:12.332 --> 17:13.833
Yeah and that's
exactly my point.

17:13.833 --> 17:15.102
Okay, okay.

17:15.102 --> 17:16.536
Well you guys can
have a nice life.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.409
- I'm sorry is everything cool?

17:22.409 --> 17:24.377
(phone ringing)
- Oh my god, fuck off.

17:25.811 --> 17:27.980
- Sorry I can give you
some space if you need it.

17:27.980 --> 17:29.048
- No, thank you.

17:39.192 --> 17:41.328
- [Zoe] So is that
your boyfriend?

17:42.429 --> 17:43.296
- Not anymore.

17:46.799 --> 17:47.734
- Do you wanna talk about it?

17:47.734 --> 17:48.935
- I mean there's nothing to say.

17:48.935 --> 17:50.737
He's a prick and I don't
tolerate pricks so.

17:59.479 --> 18:03.049
What was up with all your
crazy night terrors last night?

18:04.951 --> 18:06.052
I thought you were
possessed, seriously.

18:06.052 --> 18:07.654
- What are you talking about?

18:07.654 --> 18:11.158
- You were up like, once
like every hour, yelling.

18:12.058 --> 18:12.859
Fricking crazy.

18:16.896 --> 18:19.065
No one's ever told you
that you do that before.

18:20.467 --> 18:21.934
- I should actually get going.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.971
- I was actually thinking,
I'll just drive down with you.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.040
- Wait what?

18:28.040 --> 18:29.509
- [Silver] You need a ride
down to the border right?

18:29.509 --> 18:31.611
- Oh yeah but, I don't
wanna ask you to do that.

18:33.079 --> 18:35.682
- So, you'd rather ride with
a complete stranger than me?

18:38.318 --> 18:41.321
(upbeat rock music)

18:47.160 --> 18:48.995
(laughing)

18:48.995 --> 18:50.263
(screaming)

18:50.263 --> 18:52.499
(laughing)

18:55.902 --> 18:57.937
- Sorry I had to get that out.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.071
(laughs) Thanks.

18:59.071 --> 19:00.307
- No you're good.

19:03.042 --> 19:05.011
- Why do you have a gigantic jar

19:05.011 --> 19:06.979
of peanut butter in your purse?

19:06.979 --> 19:08.748
- [Silver] (laughs) Why are
you judging my peanut butter?

19:08.748 --> 19:10.183
- I'm not I love peanut butter,

19:10.183 --> 19:12.785
I just, this is like pretty
heavy to carry around.

19:12.785 --> 19:14.187
- Give me some.

19:14.187 --> 19:15.021
I would like some right now,

19:15.021 --> 19:15.855
now that you mention it.

19:18.458 --> 19:19.992
Ah.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.061
(laughs)

19:24.964 --> 19:26.098
- Hmm.

19:26.098 --> 19:28.368
(laughing)

19:32.171 --> 19:35.542
- So, how serious is it?

19:36.943 --> 19:38.278
- What do you mean?

19:38.278 --> 19:40.380
- [Silver] Well you said
you got into some shit.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.749
Like breaking into
houses or whatever,

19:42.749 --> 19:44.083
how serious we talking?

19:45.985 --> 19:47.287
- I don't know.

19:47.287 --> 19:48.120
Does it really matter?

19:48.988 --> 19:50.457
- Well yeah, it kind of does.

19:50.457 --> 19:52.158
I mean we need to figure
out where we're gonna cross.

19:53.626 --> 19:54.461
- I don't know.

19:55.828 --> 19:58.164
It was all, kind of a blur.

19:59.532 --> 20:00.933
- I can walk you through it.

20:02.335 --> 20:05.672
So first of all you break
into some big ass house right?

20:06.606 --> 20:07.674
- [Zoe] Right.

20:07.674 --> 20:08.741
- Okay and then what?

20:12.612 --> 20:14.447
- I don't know.

20:14.447 --> 20:16.483
I thought it was empty and

20:20.920 --> 20:21.988
I was walking through

20:24.190 --> 20:26.859
and then out of
nowhere he came at me.

20:26.859 --> 20:28.695
- [Silver] Who?

20:28.695 --> 20:30.162
- The guy who's house it was.

20:32.965 --> 20:36.369
So I grabbed something really
heavy off the bookshelf and

20:39.205 --> 20:41.574
I hit him over the head with it.

20:43.510 --> 20:44.811
- Is he fucking dead?

20:47.213 --> 20:48.415
- I don't know.

20:51.518 --> 20:52.319
Maybe.

20:54.186 --> 20:54.987
I think so.

20:56.022 --> 20:57.123
- Holy shit.

20:59.125 --> 21:00.427
I mean it was like
a mansion right,

21:00.427 --> 21:02.028
so were there
cameras everywhere?

21:08.267 --> 21:10.403
Dude we've gotta figure
something else out,

21:10.403 --> 21:11.338
you can't cross in San Diego.

21:14.641 --> 21:17.610
(engine revving)

21:17.610 --> 21:18.678
- Where are you going?

21:18.678 --> 21:19.912
- It's way too obvious,

21:19.912 --> 21:21.714
you've gotta get
out of California.

21:21.714 --> 21:24.717
We should go to Arizona, maybe
even like Texas or something.

21:28.821 --> 21:29.756
- Are you serious?

21:29.756 --> 21:30.623
- [Silver] Yes I'm serious.

21:32.725 --> 21:34.861
- And you're gonna take
me all the way there?

21:34.861 --> 21:36.228
- You're damn right I will.

21:37.497 --> 21:40.400
(melancholy music)

21:58.518 --> 22:00.319
- Still nothing?

22:00.319 --> 22:01.588
- No.

22:01.588 --> 22:02.955
Motherfuck.

22:02.955 --> 22:05.358
- I could go to the
store and get a map?

22:05.358 --> 22:07.360
- No, it's cool I've
got one in the van.

22:17.069 --> 22:19.972
(melancholy music)

22:27.146 --> 22:27.980
(map thudding)

22:27.980 --> 22:28.815
Boom.

22:30.750 --> 22:33.486
Okay, so.

22:33.486 --> 22:34.987
Where exactly is your brother?

22:36.322 --> 22:37.590
- You don't have to take
me all the way there.

22:37.590 --> 22:39.025
We can just cross wherever?

22:40.693 --> 22:42.161
- Zoe.

22:42.161 --> 22:43.630
Where does your brother live?

22:46.866 --> 22:49.201
- Okay, so he's
on the coast here.

22:49.201 --> 22:50.703
But he said he can
come up and meet us.

22:50.703 --> 22:53.940
It's a little border
town right about there.

22:55.174 --> 22:57.610
- Okay nice, that should
take like two days tops.

22:57.610 --> 22:58.878
Maybe less if we're lucky.

23:00.046 --> 23:00.813
- That long?

23:02.181 --> 23:04.283
- Have you seen how fricking
slow that thing runs?

23:06.085 --> 23:06.919
- (laughs) Shouldn't we
just cross in Arizona?

23:06.919 --> 23:08.655
It'll be closer.

23:08.655 --> 23:10.423
- No, the further away
we are from California

23:10.423 --> 23:11.924
the less heat there is on you.

23:16.629 --> 23:18.798
- And what about you?

23:18.798 --> 23:20.900
You're willing to just
take that risk too?

23:24.904 --> 23:28.007
Doesn't that make you an
accessory or something?

23:31.143 --> 23:33.345
- Do you want my help or what?

23:33.345 --> 23:34.547
- I do, of course.

23:34.547 --> 23:36.949
- Okay, then stop trying
to talk me out of it

23:36.949 --> 23:39.218
or you're gonna lose your ride.

23:39.218 --> 23:40.019
Let's go.

23:42.722 --> 23:45.424
(sighs)

23:45.424 --> 23:46.926
(engine rumbling)

23:46.926 --> 23:48.327
No, no, no, no, no.

23:48.327 --> 23:49.762
Fuck shit.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.664
- [Zoe] What was that?

23:51.664 --> 23:52.765
- The tank is drained.

23:54.233 --> 23:55.502
- [Zoe] But the
gauge says it's--

23:55.502 --> 23:56.869
- I know what it
says, it's busted.

23:58.104 --> 23:59.639
Oh my God.

23:59.639 --> 24:00.573
- [Zoe] Okay well lets just
stop for gas in the next town,

24:00.573 --> 24:01.373
no big deal.

24:04.010 --> 24:04.844
- Oh my God.

24:09.849 --> 24:10.683
We're gonna have to pull over.

24:13.720 --> 24:16.723
(engine stuttering)

24:26.666 --> 24:28.935
(sighs)

24:28.935 --> 24:29.769
- Fuck.

24:42.715 --> 24:44.083
Anything?

24:44.083 --> 24:44.917
- Fuck.

24:48.888 --> 24:50.422
- So what do we do now?

24:50.422 --> 24:51.891
- I don't know, just be quiet
and give me a second to think.

24:54.894 --> 24:56.162
- I can walk into town.

25:03.736 --> 25:05.104
Should I flag someone down?

25:05.104 --> 25:06.305
- Who are you gonna flag down?

25:06.305 --> 25:07.874
There's no one around.

25:07.874 --> 25:10.977
- [Zoe] You do realize
this isn't my fault right?

25:10.977 --> 25:11.978
- Oh my God.

25:32.899 --> 25:33.966
(sighs)

25:33.966 --> 25:35.568
This is broken too.

25:41.307 --> 25:43.442
I'm sorry I snapped at you.

25:43.442 --> 25:46.579
I'm just frustrated because
the van keeps acting up

25:46.579 --> 25:49.582
and she's all I've got you know.

25:51.250 --> 25:52.084
- I know.

25:56.022 --> 25:57.123
What's her name?

25:57.123 --> 25:58.457
- Hmm?

25:58.457 --> 25:59.391
- The van.

25:59.391 --> 26:02.629
- Oh uh, Fran, Fran the van.

26:02.629 --> 26:03.462
- Fran the van.

26:05.364 --> 26:06.666
Good old Fran.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.003
Hey we're gonna figure this out.

26:12.438 --> 26:13.372
- I hope so.

26:13.372 --> 26:14.707
- Fran's gonna pull through.

26:16.475 --> 26:19.411
(melancholy music)

26:54.881 --> 26:55.882
- [Silver] Oh my God.

26:55.882 --> 26:57.283
Someone's coming.

26:59.418 --> 27:01.954
- Hi thank God,
we ran out of gas.

27:03.422 --> 27:05.424
(man laughs)

27:05.424 --> 27:07.593
Any chance you'd mind
giving us a lift into town

27:07.593 --> 27:09.561
or the nearest gas station?

27:09.561 --> 27:11.063
- That's 30 miles out.

27:13.565 --> 27:14.600
That means no.

27:17.870 --> 27:19.538
- Come on, why'd
you pull over then?

27:19.538 --> 27:20.773
- I've gotta take a shit.

27:22.875 --> 27:24.210
You're welcome to watch.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.882
- Please, we could
be here all day.

27:29.882 --> 27:30.717
- Yeah.

27:33.820 --> 27:38.524
It's about an hour to the
nearest station and back.

27:38.524 --> 27:41.560
So unless you wanna sweeten
the deal a little bit?

27:45.898 --> 27:46.733
Yeah, hmm.

27:48.100 --> 27:49.001
Thought so.

27:52.438 --> 27:54.106
- Can we at least
use your phone?

27:54.106 --> 27:55.007
- [Man] It's dead.

28:03.415 --> 28:04.350
- I'm sorry I tried.

28:04.350 --> 28:05.251
- Fuck that prick.

28:09.088 --> 28:10.322
- What's that?

28:10.322 --> 28:11.623
- Just keep him
distracted, cool.

28:11.623 --> 28:13.459
Here, ask him for a light

28:13.459 --> 28:15.561
and stay on this
side of the van okay.

28:15.561 --> 28:16.395
Go.

28:51.697 --> 28:53.766
(laughs)

29:05.778 --> 29:06.612
- Hey.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.750
- I thought I told you I
couldn't take you into town.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.419
- Yeah, I actually, um,

29:13.419 --> 29:15.221
was just wondering
if you had a light.

29:16.889 --> 29:19.725
- (laughs) No sense
smoking the filter.

29:20.993 --> 29:22.494
That shit'll give you cancer.

29:23.562 --> 29:24.396
Here.

29:26.365 --> 29:27.699
You wanna light.

29:29.235 --> 29:30.636
You know what I left
my light in the car.

29:30.636 --> 29:33.172
- Oh wait, um, I actually
think I have one,

29:33.172 --> 29:35.808
I just, I can't get
it to light sometimes.

29:37.376 --> 29:38.978
If you don't mind trying for me.

29:48.554 --> 29:50.923
- Yeah it's them damn
safety's on these things.

29:52.091 --> 29:54.426
You girls ain't good
with anything are you?

29:54.426 --> 29:55.794
- Thanks.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.096
- [Man] Hmm.

29:57.096 --> 30:00.132
- Any by the way I'm
sorry about before.

30:04.003 --> 30:04.937
- Well you're a pretty girl.

30:08.440 --> 30:09.375
You're allowed to be a bother.

30:12.178 --> 30:13.579
- Get your hands off of her.

30:14.847 --> 30:15.948
- Who the fuck are you?

30:15.948 --> 30:16.815
- Her girlfriend.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.722
- (laughs) Nasty bitches.

30:26.392 --> 30:27.293
- Look what I got.

30:37.569 --> 30:39.438
- I didn't know you had so
many tricks up your sleeve.

30:43.542 --> 30:45.577
(engine revving)

30:45.577 --> 30:47.679
- Oh no way, look
what we have here.

30:49.015 --> 30:50.849
(laughing)

30:50.849 --> 30:53.385
(horn blaring)

30:54.887 --> 30:56.455
- Nasty bitches!

30:56.455 --> 30:58.557
(laughing)

30:58.557 --> 31:01.060
(horn blaring)

31:05.264 --> 31:06.732
- Fuck him.

31:06.732 --> 31:09.335
* Heading for the coast

31:09.335 --> 31:12.204
* Hmm

31:12.204 --> 31:15.007
* Uh

31:15.007 --> 31:17.009
* Oh oh

31:18.177 --> 31:20.612
- This hotel was such
a good call right?

31:20.612 --> 31:22.081
- Yeah, thank you so much.

31:22.081 --> 31:24.116
That shower was life changing.

31:24.116 --> 31:25.284
- [Silver] I know right.

31:29.021 --> 31:30.322
- Hey do you think we'll
still be able to make it

31:30.322 --> 31:31.223
by tomorrow night?

31:32.191 --> 31:33.592
- Oh I doubt it.

31:33.592 --> 31:35.694
Especially after our
little hold up today.

31:37.863 --> 31:40.532
I'm thinking we'll probably
need one more night actually.

31:40.532 --> 31:43.402
Which should put us at
an early border crossing

31:43.402 --> 31:44.937
the next morning.

31:44.937 --> 31:46.205
Which is actually probably
better in the long run,

31:46.205 --> 31:47.706
because I bet those
border patrol guys

31:47.706 --> 31:49.641
and way more chill
in the morning.

31:49.641 --> 31:50.442
- That's fine.

31:52.911 --> 31:56.182
(guitar strums)

31:56.182 --> 31:59.618
* Hmm hmm hmm hmm

31:59.618 --> 32:02.688
* Hmm hmm hmm

32:02.688 --> 32:05.191
* Hmm hmm hmm

32:07.459 --> 32:08.294
Sorry.

32:08.294 --> 32:09.295
- No keep going.

32:09.295 --> 32:11.230
You're so much better than me.

32:11.230 --> 32:12.464
I just brought it up
to mess around with

32:12.464 --> 32:13.499
but you're like
actually talented.

32:14.900 --> 32:16.368
- I wouldn't go
that far (laughs).

32:17.936 --> 32:19.438
- [Silver] Okay well go, sing.

32:19.438 --> 32:20.706
- I don't sing.

32:20.706 --> 32:22.074
- [Silver] Bullshit.

32:22.074 --> 32:23.575
- I don't, I barely even play.

32:23.575 --> 32:25.911
- Okay anyone who can
play guitar like that

32:25.911 --> 32:28.414
can definitely sing, that's
just like a fact of life.

32:28.414 --> 32:29.248
- Well not me.

32:29.248 --> 32:30.082
- [Silver] Why not?

32:32.918 --> 32:35.621
- I wasn't exactly encouraged
in my family growing up.

32:36.722 --> 32:38.757
- Is that why you ran away

32:38.757 --> 32:40.626
because you had like, a super
strict family or something?

32:44.596 --> 32:46.032
- Not exactly.

32:46.032 --> 32:48.234
- Okay well screw
it, you're here now

32:48.234 --> 32:49.035
and I wanna hear you sing.

32:51.337 --> 32:52.604
Go, I'm not watching.

32:52.604 --> 32:55.041
Look, I'll just be
facing this way,

32:55.041 --> 32:56.308
not even paying attention.

32:58.077 --> 32:59.245
- (laughs) Stop peeking.

33:00.646 --> 33:02.114
- Then go.

33:02.114 --> 33:02.481
Oh my God, it's not a big
deal, I'm not judging.

33:04.250 --> 33:06.652
- Don't judge, I'm
probably gonna mess up.

33:08.220 --> 33:10.922
* Hmm mmm

33:10.922 --> 33:14.126
* Hmm mm mm

33:14.126 --> 33:17.429
* Hmm mmm

33:17.429 --> 33:20.699
* Hmm

33:20.699 --> 33:24.170
* A wooo

33:24.170 --> 33:27.306
* Ooo

33:27.306 --> 33:29.208
* Oooo

33:30.642 --> 33:33.412
- [Silver] You're so good.

33:33.412 --> 33:35.347
* Oooo

33:36.915 --> 33:38.984
(suspenseful music)
(gasps)

33:38.984 --> 33:40.652
- What?

33:40.652 --> 33:43.155
- Sorry, um, I'm really tired.

33:43.155 --> 33:44.390
- [Silver] I'm
sorry, what did I do?

33:44.390 --> 33:46.258
- Nothing, I, I just,
I don't feel that well.

33:46.258 --> 33:47.959
- Okay well you felt
fine just a minute ago

33:47.959 --> 33:49.361
so why are you spazzing out?

33:53.031 --> 33:54.133
- Can we just drop it?

33:57.303 --> 33:58.604
- Yeah whatever.

33:59.538 --> 34:02.341
(melancholy music)

34:12.884 --> 34:15.887
(suspenseful music)

34:42.748 --> 34:44.850
(screams)

34:44.850 --> 34:47.018
(panting)

35:03.101 --> 35:04.035
- [Weather Woman]
We'll be watching that

35:04.035 --> 35:05.271
through the weekend.

35:05.271 --> 35:07.306
Nice, drifting clouds
hang out over the area.

35:07.306 --> 35:10.376
54 degrees in Sedona, 40
in Whitlow, 33 in Show Low

35:10.376 --> 35:11.977
and 24 in Flagstaff,

35:11.977 --> 35:14.413
we'll see top temperatures
at 42 tonight--

35:17.183 --> 35:18.016
- You're up early?

35:18.884 --> 35:20.352
- Yeah well I couldn't sleep.

35:24.055 --> 35:26.925
- Oh my God, it's
so cold in here.

35:28.360 --> 35:29.761
- Okay well you can book
the hotel room next time?

35:31.163 --> 35:33.965
- [Weather Woman] 70 in Sedona,
out to our East 71 in Globe.

35:33.965 --> 35:37.969
And we'll see a low or I should
mid to upper 60 in Show Low.

35:39.371 --> 35:40.606
- Is this 'cause of last night?

35:40.606 --> 35:41.873
I told you, I wasn't
trying to be rude.

35:41.873 --> 35:43.108
I was just--

35:43.108 --> 35:44.643
- Your night terrors
or whatever they are,

35:44.643 --> 35:46.144
are like constant.

35:48.046 --> 35:50.282
God, I can't get any
sleep with you around.

35:52.218 --> 35:53.552
- Sorry I didn't realize.

35:54.886 --> 35:57.889
(suspenseful music)

36:00.158 --> 36:01.092
- I'm sorry.

36:02.928 --> 36:05.764
Look, I'm in a bad
mood because I'm tired

36:05.764 --> 36:07.566
and we have a lot of
driving to do today

36:07.566 --> 36:09.968
and when I'm tired
I'm an asshole.

36:11.370 --> 36:13.805
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
it like that, I promise.

36:17.876 --> 36:20.078
- Look maybe it's best if
I just get a lift into town

36:20.078 --> 36:21.880
and I can figure
something else out.

36:23.081 --> 36:24.550
- Don't be like that.

36:24.550 --> 36:26.352
- [Zoe] Like what?

36:26.352 --> 36:27.719
- Did I apologize?

36:28.587 --> 36:29.921
- [Zoe] Yes.

36:29.921 --> 36:31.790
- Okay well do you
accept my apology?

36:34.326 --> 36:35.160
- Yeah sure.

36:36.562 --> 36:37.663
- Okay then shut
up and let's go.

36:38.897 --> 36:42.000
Come on, we've gotta get ready.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.936
(melancholy music)

36:56.448 --> 36:58.149
- Are you coming to what?

36:58.149 --> 37:01.787
- Well maybe if I had a little
help packing, freeloader.

37:01.787 --> 37:04.356
(laughs)

37:04.356 --> 37:05.957
Mind if I grab a cigarette?

37:05.957 --> 37:07.426
- You smoke now?

37:07.426 --> 37:09.194
- I think you got me hooked.

37:09.194 --> 37:11.797
- [Silver] There's a
pack in the glove box.

37:11.797 --> 37:12.731
- Cool.

37:12.731 --> 37:14.900
- [Silver] Grab me one too.

37:21.206 --> 37:22.408
- Why do you need a gun?

37:23.475 --> 37:24.976
- Don't worry, it's not loaded.

37:27.913 --> 37:28.747
It's fine.

37:32.884 --> 37:34.119
Why do you think I need a gun?

37:34.119 --> 37:35.521
I'm a girl and I live
alone in a fricking van.

37:38.990 --> 37:40.359
Plus it makes me feel safe.

37:41.527 --> 37:42.361
- Yeah.

37:43.862 --> 37:45.331
- Have you ever shot one?

37:45.331 --> 37:46.164
- No.

37:50.969 --> 37:53.004
Will you teach me?

37:53.004 --> 37:54.039
- [Silver] Fuck yeah.

37:57.443 --> 38:00.346
(melancholy music)

38:38.850 --> 38:41.420
(gun clicking)

38:41.420 --> 38:42.287
- Does this work?

38:43.455 --> 38:44.022
- Yeah, yeah, yeah
that's perfect.

38:48.694 --> 38:49.861
Alright, hold this.

38:51.096 --> 38:52.631
Oh my God.

38:52.631 --> 38:54.332
Okay, first lesson, don't
point a gun at anyone.

38:54.332 --> 38:55.467
Treat it as if it's loaded.
- Sorry.

38:55.467 --> 38:57.068
- Even if the safety's on, just.

38:58.203 --> 38:59.004
Okay.

39:00.138 --> 39:02.408
Alright, you go it?

39:02.408 --> 39:03.609
- Yeah.

39:03.609 --> 39:04.610
- Alright.

39:04.610 --> 39:05.577
- [Zoe] What are you doing?

39:05.577 --> 39:07.879
- It's so much better like this.

39:07.879 --> 39:09.114
- What?

39:09.114 --> 39:10.516
- I'm telling you,
I wouldn't lie.

39:13.118 --> 39:14.052
Okay.

39:14.052 --> 39:16.422
- You're crazy.
- Chill out.

39:16.422 --> 39:17.689
(laughing)

39:17.689 --> 39:19.157
Okay.

39:19.157 --> 39:20.258
So what you're gonna do, is
you're gonna hold it like this.

39:20.258 --> 39:22.594
Put your fingers on this side,

39:22.594 --> 39:23.795
keep your finger on
that side of the trigger

39:23.795 --> 39:25.731
until you're ready
to squeeze it.

39:25.731 --> 39:27.132
- Okay.

39:27.132 --> 39:29.300
- And then you point at
whatever you're gonna shoot at.

39:30.402 --> 39:33.138
And you look,
close one eye and--

39:35.106 --> 39:36.775
(gun fires)

39:36.775 --> 39:38.143
(laughs)

39:38.143 --> 39:38.977
Okay, wanna go again.

39:41.513 --> 39:42.781
(gun fires)
(glass smashes)

39:42.781 --> 39:43.682
- You got one!

39:43.682 --> 39:44.983
- Fuck yes I got one.

39:44.983 --> 39:46.184
Okay, are you ready?

39:46.184 --> 39:47.419
- Yeah.

39:47.419 --> 39:48.420
- [Silver] Okay well
let's go, suit up.

39:48.420 --> 39:49.254
- What?

39:49.254 --> 39:50.088
- Yeah.
- No.

39:50.088 --> 39:50.922
- Yeah.

39:52.924 --> 39:54.225
Come on, you're gonna
regret it if you don't.

39:54.225 --> 39:55.060
- [Zoe] Okay, okay.

39:55.060 --> 39:55.994
- It's so fun.

39:55.994 --> 39:56.728
- [Zoe] I'm keeping this on.

39:58.530 --> 40:00.732
- Okay here. Hold it.

40:00.732 --> 40:01.767
Yeah carefully.

40:01.767 --> 40:03.401
- It's cold.

40:03.401 --> 40:04.670
- Okay keep your
thumb on that side

40:04.670 --> 40:06.805
or else you'll jam it
and get so fucked up.

40:06.805 --> 40:08.039
- Okay.

40:08.039 --> 40:08.974
- Okay, don't put
that on the trigger

40:08.974 --> 40:09.541
until you're ready to shoot.

40:09.541 --> 40:10.842
- Okay.

40:10.842 --> 40:12.644
- Alright now--
- And I just pull the trigger?

40:12.644 --> 40:13.979
- Yep, close one of your eyes.

40:13.979 --> 40:15.681
Aim at--
- Oh it's cold (laughs).

40:16.915 --> 40:19.751
- Aim at whatever you
wanna aim at and go.

40:21.887 --> 40:23.088
(gun fires)

40:23.088 --> 40:24.322
- Woo!

40:24.322 --> 40:25.957
- Okay, okay, okay, calm
down, calm down dude.

40:25.957 --> 40:26.825
- Wow I suck, sorry.

40:26.825 --> 40:28.026
- No, no, no.

40:28.026 --> 40:28.660
Okay, just you
have to try again.

40:30.361 --> 40:31.797
- Okay, I'm, I'm super nervous.

40:31.797 --> 40:33.699
- Just pretend the bottles
are something else.

40:33.699 --> 40:34.833
Put a face on 'em.

40:34.833 --> 40:36.568
Someone you absolutely
fucking hate.

40:36.568 --> 40:38.604
Pretend they're right there.

40:38.604 --> 40:41.940
(suspenseful music)

40:41.940 --> 40:44.843
(gun firing)

40:44.843 --> 40:47.546
(glass smashes)

40:47.546 --> 40:49.080
Okay Zoe.

40:49.080 --> 40:50.315
Zoe, Zoe, Zoe, Zoe, okay
chill, it's empty, chill.

40:51.883 --> 40:52.684
Are you good?

40:54.219 --> 40:55.353
- Yeah.
- Okay.

40:56.287 --> 40:57.789
You okay?

40:57.789 --> 40:59.991
(laughing)

41:01.793 --> 41:04.530
(peaceful music)

41:20.145 --> 41:22.480
No, no, no, no, we need to get
you something else to wear.

41:22.480 --> 41:23.982
- Why?

41:23.982 --> 41:25.483
I'm fine in this.

41:25.483 --> 41:26.151
- No, you look ridiculous
and you smell like ass.

41:26.151 --> 41:27.619
Here, wear that.

41:27.619 --> 41:29.154
- I don't wanna take
all your clothes.

41:29.154 --> 41:30.756
- Shut up.

41:30.756 --> 41:32.824
I don't wanna keep looking
at you in that stupid outfit.

41:32.824 --> 41:33.925
- (laughs) Okay, fine.

41:40.398 --> 41:41.633
Is it cool if I grab these?

41:41.633 --> 41:43.201
- Yeah, here take
these jeans too.

41:44.469 --> 41:45.270
- Sweet.

41:53.845 --> 41:56.582
(food crunching)

42:01.486 --> 42:02.387
(burps)

42:02.387 --> 42:04.623
(laughs)

42:04.623 --> 42:06.558
What is wrong with you?

42:08.093 --> 42:10.195
- Dude that was pretty
intense back there.

42:11.597 --> 42:12.598
- You're telling me.

42:14.032 --> 42:16.167
- No that was like pure rage.

42:16.167 --> 42:18.303
- I was just getting started.

42:18.303 --> 42:19.437
- Oh.

42:19.437 --> 42:20.872
(laughing)

42:20.872 --> 42:21.873
No, that was something else.

42:21.873 --> 42:23.208
That was like cold blooded.

42:24.643 --> 42:26.912
You must have had some crazy
asshole on your mind huh?

42:26.912 --> 42:27.713
- Yeah.

42:37.122 --> 42:39.024
- Hey, it's okay.

42:40.726 --> 42:41.559
- Can you not?

42:46.031 --> 42:47.498
- Jesus, what is it with you?

42:48.399 --> 42:49.267
- Nothing, I'm sorry.

42:50.201 --> 42:51.737
- It's obviously not nothing.

42:51.737 --> 42:55.273
It's like any time I try to
come near you, you freak out.

42:56.441 --> 42:58.276
I just, I don't get why
you have to act like

42:58.276 --> 43:00.045
a fricking rape victim
all the time, it's weird.

43:05.884 --> 43:06.752
Oh my God.

43:09.487 --> 43:10.922
I'm so sorry.

43:14.225 --> 43:15.060
- It's fine.

43:16.795 --> 43:18.129
- No it's not fine.

43:18.129 --> 43:19.364
- It doesn't matter.

43:19.364 --> 43:20.966
Just forget it, it
was a long time ago.

43:26.371 --> 43:28.139
- Oh my God, fuck,
I hate myself.

43:28.139 --> 43:29.574
I'm so, I'm sorry.

43:29.574 --> 43:31.176
- [Zoe] I know.

43:31.176 --> 43:32.577
- I didn't even mean
it like that I...

43:39.317 --> 43:41.352
What happened to the guy?

43:47.292 --> 43:48.126
- Nothing.

43:55.333 --> 43:57.903
(sighs)

43:57.903 --> 44:00.071
Absolutely nothing.

44:00.071 --> 44:03.008
(melancholy music)

45:11.509 --> 45:13.511
(sighs)

45:30.561 --> 45:33.164
(door grating)

45:34.199 --> 45:35.867
What took you so long?

45:35.867 --> 45:38.369
- [Silver] Oh my God I was
only gone for like 10 minutes.

45:38.369 --> 45:39.404
- Who was that guy?

45:39.404 --> 45:40.906
- Oh no one.

45:40.906 --> 45:43.174
- [Zoe] Didn't look like no one.

45:43.174 --> 45:44.509
- I mean he's some trucker.

45:45.944 --> 45:47.412
What I thought you were
hungry for a real dinner?

45:48.713 --> 45:50.448
I had to score us a few bucks.

45:51.649 --> 45:52.550
- What did you do?

45:53.451 --> 45:54.585
- Oh I have my ways.

45:57.488 --> 45:58.689
(laughs)

45:58.689 --> 46:00.225
- You seriously just
let him do that to you?

46:00.225 --> 46:02.360
- No you idiot, I only give
head for liquor, chill out.

46:02.360 --> 46:03.694
I'm kidding.

46:03.694 --> 46:04.662
(laughs) Oh my God.

46:06.031 --> 46:07.933
Okay, well while you sit
here and chain smoke,

46:07.933 --> 46:09.634
I'm gonna go and
get us some food.

46:10.501 --> 46:13.071
(door grating)

46:14.439 --> 46:17.175
(peaceful music)

46:37.028 --> 46:38.129
This is so good.

46:38.129 --> 46:38.964
- Hell yeah.

46:39.965 --> 46:40.999
Rags to riches.

46:40.999 --> 46:41.833
- Hmm-mm.

46:44.402 --> 46:46.771
It sure beats the hell
out of your oatmeal.

46:46.771 --> 46:47.705
- Hey no fair.

46:48.907 --> 46:51.843
Limited resources,
I did what I could.

46:51.843 --> 46:52.844
- It sucked.

46:57.815 --> 47:00.718
- You know if you needed money,
you could've asked me right?

47:02.087 --> 47:03.588
- You're broke too right?

47:03.588 --> 47:07.558
- Yeah but, I don't
know, you could've asked.

47:07.558 --> 47:08.659
And we'd have figured
something out together.

47:09.861 --> 47:11.562
- Well we did, or else
we wouldn't have this.

47:12.697 --> 47:14.599
Plus, you would
have just suggested

47:14.599 --> 47:17.903
using that card that you jacked
and it doesn't even work.

47:17.903 --> 47:19.570
- What?

47:19.570 --> 47:21.539
- Yeah I tried it at the
motel and it said declined,

47:21.539 --> 47:23.308
which was super annoying,
so I had to use my own cash,

47:23.308 --> 47:25.110
which like, I
wasn't planning on.

47:25.110 --> 47:26.044
- What card?

47:26.044 --> 47:27.145
What are you talking about?

47:27.145 --> 47:28.413
- I don't know, you were asleep,

47:28.413 --> 47:29.915
I found it on the
floor of the van.

47:29.915 --> 47:31.950
It's a Thomas or something,
it's like a blue credit card,

47:31.950 --> 47:33.885
I figured you jacked it from
that guy that you robbed,

47:33.885 --> 47:36.121
but it didn't even work
so it doesn't matter.

47:37.022 --> 47:37.855
Didn't even use it.

47:40.691 --> 47:42.994
- Are you fucking crazy?

47:42.994 --> 47:44.295
- What are you talking about?

47:44.295 --> 47:46.097
- Are you that thick,
seriously Silver?

47:46.097 --> 47:47.232
Give me the card.

47:48.366 --> 47:49.800
- Okay here.

47:49.800 --> 47:51.069
- Fuck.

47:51.069 --> 47:52.737
- Zoe stop.

47:52.737 --> 47:53.671
Zoe wait.

47:53.671 --> 47:54.906
- Leave me the fuck alone.

47:54.906 --> 47:55.840
- I'm sorry I used
the stupid card,

47:55.840 --> 47:56.541
I thought the guy was dead.

47:56.541 --> 47:57.842
- I don't know.

47:57.842 --> 47:59.844
Maybe he's not,
maybe I was wrong.

48:01.312 --> 48:02.547
- What?

48:02.547 --> 48:04.082
- I think he might
be following us.

48:05.316 --> 48:07.618
I saw his car on
the road yesterday

48:07.618 --> 48:09.354
and again at the rest stop.

48:10.521 --> 48:13.124
- How do you even know
what his car looks like?

48:13.124 --> 48:16.361
- I just, I recognized
it from his driveway.

48:16.361 --> 48:19.097
- You're being paranoid, a lot
of people have the same car.

48:19.097 --> 48:21.832
And you said he was
dead, he's dead.

48:21.832 --> 48:23.368
It doesn't matter.
- I don't know.

48:23.368 --> 48:24.535
I don't know what
to think anymore.

48:24.535 --> 48:27.605
I just, I just
want it to be over.

48:27.605 --> 48:29.774
(sobbing)

48:33.278 --> 48:34.112
Fuck.

48:38.116 --> 48:39.917
I can't go back.

48:39.917 --> 48:42.787
(sobbing)

48:42.787 --> 48:45.690
(melancholy music)

49:27.498 --> 49:29.134
- Everything's gonna be okay.

49:29.134 --> 49:30.068
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you,

49:30.068 --> 49:31.069
you know that right?

49:37.042 --> 49:39.044
- What if it's too late?

49:41.746 --> 49:45.383
- Look, I bet that wasn't
even him in that car.

49:45.383 --> 49:46.617
If he was gonna track you down

49:46.617 --> 49:48.386
he'd probably just
call the cops.

49:51.522 --> 49:53.358
- Maybe it's not
that easy for him.

49:56.561 --> 49:59.097
- No, I'm telling
you he would of.

49:59.097 --> 50:01.199
He's not gonna drive
all the way out here.

50:02.433 --> 50:06.337
I mean, unless he like
has something to hide

50:06.337 --> 50:08.706
and he can't call the cops,
but if that's the case,

50:08.706 --> 50:11.442
you're probably like the last
thing on his mind anyway.

50:14.845 --> 50:15.746
- What if I'm not?

50:24.422 --> 50:25.790
- Did something else
happen that night?

50:34.232 --> 50:36.834
Did he, like, do
something to you?

50:53.451 --> 50:56.821
And that's why you
tried to kill him?

50:56.821 --> 50:57.622
- Yeah.

51:04.262 --> 51:06.264
(sighs)

51:07.732 --> 51:09.967
- Right well if we see
that asshole again,

51:09.967 --> 51:10.968
I'll finish him myself.

51:21.045 --> 51:22.980
(melancholy music)

51:22.980 --> 51:23.814
Okay.

52:43.160 --> 52:45.162
- Where are we?

52:45.162 --> 52:45.996
- Here.

52:47.898 --> 52:48.733
Come out.

53:03.681 --> 53:06.451
(peaceful music)

53:55.766 --> 53:59.370
(camera whirring)

53:59.370 --> 54:01.306
- You think maybe we should
get back on the road soon?

54:02.507 --> 54:04.975
- Come on, you earned it.

54:04.975 --> 54:05.810
It's okay.

54:11.682 --> 54:14.785
So have you been thinking
anymore about tomorrow?

54:14.785 --> 54:16.020
- You mean like crossing?

54:17.154 --> 54:18.656
- Well like after,

54:18.656 --> 54:21.392
like how long you're gonna
stay in Mexico or whatever.

54:21.392 --> 54:24.795
- I don't know, I haven't
really figured that out yet.

54:24.795 --> 54:29.233
But I guess until at
least all this blows over,

54:29.233 --> 54:30.868
if that's even possible.

54:32.570 --> 54:34.639
- Well how long do you
think that's gonna be?

54:35.806 --> 54:37.241
- Why, are you gonna miss me?

54:38.208 --> 54:39.176
- Just wondering.

54:46.884 --> 54:49.320
You know if you,
like after we cross,

54:49.320 --> 54:51.489
if you like still need
anything or whatever,

54:51.489 --> 54:54.659
I mean, I don't have
anywhere I need to be so.

54:56.527 --> 54:58.529
- Thanks but you've
already done enough.

55:01.866 --> 55:03.434
- Okay.

55:03.434 --> 55:04.902
- No, not like that.

55:04.902 --> 55:08.439
I just, I mean you've
seriously done more for me

55:08.439 --> 55:10.307
than I could of ever asked.

55:10.307 --> 55:11.141
Thank you.

55:15.713 --> 55:16.547
- Okay well.

55:20.418 --> 55:21.852
Yes.

55:21.852 --> 55:23.053
- Oh no, I hate pictures.
- This is happening.

55:23.053 --> 55:24.889
- No (laughs).

55:24.889 --> 55:26.290
- Come on, if we get booked
at the border tomorrow

55:26.290 --> 55:28.225
I wanna at least have
something to remember you by.

55:28.225 --> 55:29.259
- Fine, go before
I change my mind.

55:29.259 --> 55:30.795
- Hey, one for my jail cell.

55:32.697 --> 55:35.466
(peaceful music)

55:50.615 --> 55:52.450
Zoe, Zoe, wake up, wake up.

55:52.450 --> 55:54.218
Dude look at the
sign, did you see it?

55:54.218 --> 55:56.587
You missed it sleepy ass.

55:56.587 --> 55:57.855
(laughing)

55:57.855 --> 55:59.424
It says we're 50 miles
away from the border.

55:59.424 --> 56:00.791
- That's rad.

56:00.791 --> 56:02.192
- Are you cool?

56:02.192 --> 56:03.428
I saw a sign for a campsite,

56:03.428 --> 56:04.629
I think it should be
coming up any minute.

56:04.629 --> 56:06.130
Are you cool to just
like crash for the night

56:06.130 --> 56:07.264
and do the rest tomorrow?
- Yeah of course, of course.

56:07.264 --> 56:08.733
Dude we made it.

56:08.733 --> 56:09.934
- We did time.

56:09.934 --> 56:12.437
We fricking made it.

56:12.437 --> 56:14.605
- All I did was
sleep I feel like.

56:14.605 --> 56:15.840
(laughing)

56:15.840 --> 56:18.208
Well it's a cozy
van, thanks Fran.

56:19.944 --> 56:21.446
You've been good to us.

56:32.022 --> 56:34.792
(peaceful music)

56:37.962 --> 56:40.297
(coughing)

56:40.297 --> 56:41.932
- Cough it out, cough
it out, good job.

56:41.932 --> 56:43.233
- Holy shit.

56:43.233 --> 56:44.435
Uh.

56:44.435 --> 56:46.103
That's awful, it's horrible.

56:46.103 --> 56:47.472
- Holy shit, it's not that bad.

56:47.472 --> 56:48.539
- I'm a wimp.

56:48.539 --> 56:49.373
I'm realizing.

56:51.041 --> 56:52.076
- Oh my God.

56:52.076 --> 56:53.310
- Too many years on the road.

56:55.980 --> 56:56.814
- Well.

56:57.648 --> 56:59.750
Okay so, I was thinking,

56:59.750 --> 57:02.820
before you go and I
never see you again,

57:02.820 --> 57:05.490
I do have one question,
are you ready?

57:05.490 --> 57:07.892
- Oh my God, you're
making me nervous.

57:07.892 --> 57:08.826
- Are you ready?

57:08.826 --> 57:10.194
What the fuck is in that bag?

57:12.129 --> 57:13.631
- What?

57:13.631 --> 57:15.332
- Its like it's always with
you but you never open it

57:15.332 --> 57:16.200
and you're very.

57:17.768 --> 57:20.771
- Alright, I think you've
earned an introduction.

57:20.771 --> 57:22.106
- An introduction okay.

57:24.241 --> 57:25.075
- Where are ya?

57:26.043 --> 57:27.211
- I don't you tell me.

57:27.211 --> 57:28.946
- This is Little Bean (laughs).

57:28.946 --> 57:30.447
- Oh my God.

57:30.447 --> 57:32.216
- Little Bean meet Silver,
Silver meet Little Bean.

57:32.216 --> 57:33.350
- Nice to meet you dude.

57:33.350 --> 57:34.184
- He prefers hugs.

57:34.184 --> 57:35.486
- Pound it.

57:35.486 --> 57:37.154
(laughing)

57:37.154 --> 57:38.623
- I found him in the
middle of the road,

57:38.623 --> 57:41.692
he'd been run over various
times and was covered in mud,

57:41.692 --> 57:44.895
and I gave him a bath and
he's been with me ever since.

57:44.895 --> 57:46.864
- Okay, that's like
kinda sweet I guess.

57:46.864 --> 57:48.332
A little weird but.

57:48.332 --> 57:50.601
(laughing)

57:54.772 --> 57:55.940
- Hey so.
- What?

57:57.742 --> 57:59.209
- You know, I know we've
been on the road for a while,

57:59.209 --> 58:03.480
so you probably just wanna
get back or something but um,

58:03.480 --> 58:04.715
if you don't have
anywhere to be,

58:04.715 --> 58:06.751
I was thinking maybe
it'd be cool if,

58:08.118 --> 58:10.287
you stuck around for a little
while when we get there.

58:10.287 --> 58:11.822
- Like, like in Mexico?

58:12.757 --> 58:13.991
With your brother?

58:13.991 --> 58:15.526
- Yeah if you're--
- Dude are you sure?

58:15.526 --> 58:16.794
- Obviously you don't have to,

58:16.794 --> 58:18.663
I just, you know,
he'd love to meet you.

58:18.663 --> 58:20.798
- He wouldn't mind if
I tagged along like?

58:20.798 --> 58:24.068
- No it'd be, it'd
be awesome actually.

58:24.068 --> 58:27.371
- Yes, hell fucking yes,
I wanna go to Mexico.

58:27.371 --> 58:28.673
Do you know how much,

58:28.673 --> 58:30.941
I've been dying for a
decent fucking burrito.

58:30.941 --> 58:31.942
(laughing)

58:31.942 --> 58:32.777
And I'm already packed.

58:32.777 --> 58:34.444
I'm ready.

58:34.444 --> 58:35.913
- Sweet.
- I'm there.

58:35.913 --> 58:37.114
Okay, I'm gonna go on a walk.

58:37.114 --> 58:38.182
I'm gonna let you and
Little Bean chill.

58:38.182 --> 58:39.083
- Cool.

58:39.083 --> 58:40.918
- Oh if any coyotes

58:40.918 --> 58:44.855
try to come after our
really gourmet food,

58:44.855 --> 58:46.691
I want you to blast
those motherfuckers.

58:46.691 --> 58:48.158
- Shit that's so intense.

58:48.158 --> 58:49.960
- [Silver] Yeah that's
how we roll bitch.

58:49.960 --> 58:50.795
- Ow.

58:52.529 --> 58:53.363
Wa!

58:54.865 --> 58:57.802
(melancholy music)

59:40.878 --> 59:42.479
Mind if I join you?

59:48.552 --> 59:51.288
- What's going
through your mind?

59:53.090 --> 59:53.891
- A lot.

59:56.727 --> 59:58.295
- Well spit it out.

59:59.697 --> 01:00:00.530
- I just.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.501
What if I really did kill him?

01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:08.238
- I thought you
said you saw him?

01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:11.041
- I don't know what I saw.

01:00:12.409 --> 01:00:17.081
- Well, it's like I said,
if you did kill him,

01:00:18.548 --> 01:00:20.584
then, I mean he deserves it.

01:00:22.352 --> 01:00:23.187
End of discussion.

01:00:23.187 --> 01:00:24.188
- No one deserves that.

01:00:25.856 --> 01:00:27.091
- Why are you protecting him?

01:00:27.091 --> 01:00:27.925
- I'm not.

01:00:35.532 --> 01:00:36.801
What if he had a family?

01:00:39.369 --> 01:00:40.204
A wife and a kid?

01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:42.272
What about them?

01:00:43.507 --> 01:00:46.911
- Well, then you
did them a favor.

01:01:04.094 --> 01:01:07.732
Hey, do you wanna
go back inside?

01:01:07.732 --> 01:01:08.665
- I'm fine.

01:01:20.477 --> 01:01:21.311
Thanks.

01:01:31.321 --> 01:01:33.157
Here you must be freezing.

01:01:34.825 --> 01:01:37.762
(melancholy music)

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:12.763
(suspenseful music)

01:03:02.546 --> 01:03:04.714
(gasping)

01:03:10.287 --> 01:03:12.022
Get off me.

01:03:12.022 --> 01:03:13.423
Get off me!

01:03:13.423 --> 01:03:14.691
Get off me!

01:03:14.691 --> 01:03:15.559
- Get up.

01:03:15.559 --> 01:03:16.827
- Get off.

01:03:16.827 --> 01:03:18.662
- [Silver] You're
fine, you're fine!

01:03:18.662 --> 01:03:20.464
(gun fires)

01:03:20.464 --> 01:03:22.166
(coughing)

01:03:22.166 --> 01:03:24.334
(panting)

01:03:26.336 --> 01:03:27.771
- No, no, Silver!

01:03:29.173 --> 01:03:30.107
Silver!

01:03:30.107 --> 01:03:32.709
Silver wake up, Silver wake up.

01:03:33.743 --> 01:03:35.279
No, no, no.

01:03:35.279 --> 01:03:36.113
Oh Silver.

01:03:37.014 --> 01:03:37.848
Wake up.

01:03:39.383 --> 01:03:41.651
Ah somebody help me please.

01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:43.854
(sobbing)

01:03:43.854 --> 01:03:46.790
(melancholy music)

01:03:58.068 --> 01:04:00.804
(birds squawking)

01:04:05.375 --> 01:04:08.879
(melancholy dance music)

01:05:02.399 --> 01:05:05.235
(engines revving)

01:06:12.036 --> 01:06:14.704
(phone ringing)

01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:17.741
- [Man] Zoe?

01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:21.545
Zoe.

01:06:21.545 --> 01:06:22.712
- Yeah.

01:06:22.712 --> 01:06:23.547
- [Man] Oh thank God.

01:06:24.748 --> 01:06:26.216
Tell me where you are.

01:06:26.216 --> 01:06:27.051
Exactly.

01:06:27.951 --> 01:06:28.785
- Near El Paso.

01:06:31.555 --> 01:06:32.422
Some little town.

01:06:33.657 --> 01:06:34.558
- [Man] I'm close.

01:06:36.026 --> 01:06:36.926
- So that was you.

01:06:41.865 --> 01:06:42.966
- [Man] Are you alone?

01:06:46.002 --> 01:06:47.237
- Yes.

01:06:47.237 --> 01:06:48.705
- [Man] Give me
the intersection.

01:06:57.414 --> 01:06:59.449
- Ellis and Bond Street.

01:06:59.449 --> 01:07:00.950
- [Man] Don't move.

01:07:02.186 --> 01:07:05.189
(suspenseful music)

01:07:08.558 --> 01:07:11.228
(phone banging)

01:07:43.993 --> 01:07:46.663
(brakes squeal)

01:08:08.752 --> 01:08:11.688
(melancholy music)

01:08:17.394 --> 01:08:18.694
You know you could've
killed me right?

01:08:22.799 --> 01:08:23.633
Zoe.

01:08:24.968 --> 01:08:26.236
Zoe, look at me.

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:38.615
- [Zoe] I'm sorry.

01:08:41.551 --> 01:08:42.386
- I'm fine.

01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:46.256
Nothing to cry about.

01:08:52.562 --> 01:08:53.997
You're lucky my bank called me

01:08:53.997 --> 01:08:56.064
after you tried to use my card.

01:09:07.344 --> 01:09:08.144
Hey.

01:09:09.813 --> 01:09:11.348
Don't worry.

01:09:11.348 --> 01:09:12.282
I'm not mad.

01:09:15.419 --> 01:09:16.953
I was just scared that's all.

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:25.194
Your mother's still away.

01:09:25.194 --> 01:09:26.962
She doesn't get
back until tomorrow.

01:09:33.803 --> 01:09:36.005
This will be our
little secret okay?

01:09:37.307 --> 01:09:38.475
Hmm?

01:09:38.475 --> 01:09:39.276
- Okay.

01:09:50.118 --> 01:09:52.288
- [Man] Who was that that
brought you out here?

01:09:57.294 --> 01:09:58.228
- A friend.

01:10:00.330 --> 01:10:01.631
- [Man] Did you tell
her what happened?

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:04.734
- No.

01:10:04.734 --> 01:10:06.336
- [Man] Did you tell
her what happened?

01:10:06.336 --> 01:10:07.170
- [Zoe] No.

01:10:14.077 --> 01:10:15.412
- What'd you tell her then?

01:10:16.746 --> 01:10:19.616
- I said, I had been
living on the streets.

01:10:20.784 --> 01:10:21.618
- Hmm.

01:10:28.057 --> 01:10:31.060
(suspenseful music)

01:10:45.275 --> 01:10:48.011
(engine revving)

01:11:08.665 --> 01:11:12.168
(melancholy dance music)

01:11:13.305 --> 01:11:19.296
