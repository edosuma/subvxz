WEBVTT

00:09.342 --> 00:10.760
Ba-bum.

00:11.970 --> 00:13.179
[croaks]

00:14.639 --> 00:15.890
[panting]

00:17.809 --> 00:19.561
[Rayla]  Previously on  The Dragon Prince...

00:21.604 --> 00:22.564
A letter?

00:24.524 --> 00:28.653
You'll understand in time.
I want you to break the seal when...

00:29.946 --> 00:32.490
Well, you'll know when.

00:46.963 --> 00:47.964
[gasps]

00:49.382 --> 00:51.176
What is this place?

00:57.098 --> 00:57.974
Wait.

00:58.057 --> 01:01.227
Callum, I need to tell you something.

01:03.772 --> 01:06.524
I know what happened.
He's gone.

01:07.609 --> 01:08.610
Oh, no.

01:10.695 --> 01:12.697
[theme music playing]

01:27.670 --> 01:29.088
[roaring]

02:30.316 --> 02:31.985
[Rayla] Callum, I'm sorry.

02:32.735 --> 02:35.029
I tried to tell you the king was dead.

02:35.113 --> 02:38.575
My stepdad.
He was more than just the king to me.

02:38.658 --> 02:40.451
Your stepdad. I know.

02:40.535 --> 02:43.288
I really tried,
but I could never find the right way.

02:43.371 --> 02:46.583
And whenever I tried, I messed it up,
and the next time was harder, until--

02:46.666 --> 02:49.961
Rayla, just stop.
I can't talk about this right now.

02:50.044 --> 02:52.714
All I can think about is
how I'm going to tell Ezran

02:52.797 --> 02:53.965
our father is gone.

02:54.757 --> 02:59.387
I'm sorry, Callum.
I'm so, so sorry.

03:08.980 --> 03:10.106
[sighs]

03:11.190 --> 03:12.191
[yawns]

03:23.828 --> 03:24.829
[sighs]

03:35.381 --> 03:37.300
-[sighs]
-[footsteps approach]

03:50.897 --> 03:53.983
So, have fun on your little date?

03:54.067 --> 03:56.069
[sniffling and sobbing]

03:58.112 --> 04:00.907
What happened?
What did he do to you?

04:00.990 --> 04:04.827
Nothing happened.
Callum would never hurt me.

04:05.828 --> 04:06.829
Oh.

04:07.914 --> 04:10.959
Then how come you're all weep-ridden?

04:11.042 --> 04:13.419
[scoffs] That is not an emotion, Soren.

04:13.503 --> 04:15.713
My point is, are you okay?

04:15.797 --> 04:18.758
Yeah. I'm gonna be fine.

04:18.841 --> 04:22.720
[sighs] Because you're my sister,
as you know.

04:22.804 --> 04:29.269
I'm always here for you...
to punch someone, or whatever you need.

04:30.061 --> 04:31.813
-I know.
-Good.

04:31.896 --> 04:34.482
We still have to bring the princes
back with us.

04:34.565 --> 04:36.776
Whatever it takes, whatever happens.

04:37.443 --> 04:39.612
I need to know that all this

04:39.696 --> 04:41.906
won't get in the way
of doing what we came here to do.

04:41.990 --> 04:44.200
It won't. I can do it.

05:00.258 --> 05:01.259
Callum?

05:02.260 --> 05:03.094
Morning, Ez.

05:03.761 --> 05:05.638
-I had another weird dream.
-[Bait croaks]

05:05.722 --> 05:09.934
I was running from that giant hippo.
The one made of taffy, remember?

05:10.018 --> 05:11.728
-Uh, I think so?
-[Zym chitters]

05:11.811 --> 05:14.814
Only this time,
there was someone riding on his back.

05:14.897 --> 05:17.650
It was the baker.
The one who didn't like me.

05:17.734 --> 05:20.695
He'd like you
if you stopped stealing his jelly tarts.

05:20.778 --> 05:23.156
He said I was wanted
for crimes against dessert.

05:23.239 --> 05:26.784
And to make the hippo chase me,
the baker told him I was jelly-filled.

05:26.868 --> 05:29.620
-Ez--
-I was a pastry fugitive, Callum.

05:29.704 --> 05:30.872
It was terrible.

05:31.998 --> 05:36.669
And the worst part was he was right.
I was delicious.

05:37.879 --> 05:39.088
Let's go for a walk.

05:40.548 --> 05:45.344
So, Ezran,
I wanted to talk to you about...

05:46.220 --> 05:48.306
life, and growing up

05:48.389 --> 05:54.103
and how sometimes there are changes
you don't expect.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.314
Is this the talk about sandwiches?

05:56.397 --> 05:59.317
No. No, no, no. No, not that.
No, definitely not that.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.652
Uh... [clears throat] Mmm.

06:01.736 --> 06:06.199
Ezran, for a long time,
I treated you like a little kid.

06:06.282 --> 06:08.326
And that wasn't fair.

06:09.202 --> 06:12.497
You've grown up so much,
and I'm really proud of you.

06:13.122 --> 06:15.458
Oh. Yeah.

06:15.541 --> 06:16.709
[Callum] But when you grow up,

06:16.793 --> 06:20.421
sometimes you have to face things
you're not ready for.

06:20.505 --> 06:21.547
[Ezran] I know.

06:22.757 --> 06:24.550
You know?

06:25.551 --> 06:28.930
I know everyone's counting on me
to teach Zym how to fly.

06:29.013 --> 06:30.556
-But that's just the start.
-[sighs]

06:30.640 --> 06:33.768
Someone's gonna have to teach him
all the things he's supposed to do.

06:33.851 --> 06:35.603
Everything he's supposed to be.

06:35.686 --> 06:40.108
And he's meant to learn it all
from a big, strong King of the Dragons.

06:40.775 --> 06:43.402
[Phoe-Phoe screeching]

06:43.486 --> 06:47.907
But he doesn't have that.
All he's got is me.

06:48.533 --> 06:50.576
Hey, don't be so hard on yourself, Ez.

06:51.452 --> 06:54.163
I know it'll be tough,
but no matter what, you've got us.

06:54.247 --> 06:58.459
Me and Rayla, probably Bait.
We're all here for you.

06:58.543 --> 07:00.795
Thanks, Callum. That means a lot.

07:01.629 --> 07:04.006
But I really wish Dad was here.

07:04.090 --> 07:07.927
I keep wondering what he would do.
What he would say to Zym.

07:08.845 --> 07:11.472
When I was little
and I wasn't listening to him,

07:11.556 --> 07:14.517
Dad would say, "Ezran, you're a handful."

07:14.600 --> 07:18.771
So, I tried to do that with Zym.
"Azymondias, you're a handful."

07:18.855 --> 07:21.858
But he doesn't understand.
He doesn't even have hands.

07:22.733 --> 07:27.071
I guess I just miss Dad.
He'd know what to do, you know?

07:28.114 --> 07:30.825
Callum, what's wrong?

07:32.243 --> 07:35.204
Nothing, Ez. I just really miss him, too.

07:47.425 --> 07:48.634
I couldn't do it.

07:49.594 --> 07:50.678
I couldn't tell him.

07:51.596 --> 07:52.513
Callum...

07:52.597 --> 07:55.308
And I understand why you couldn't tell me.

07:57.101 --> 07:59.437
When you care about someone,
it's hard to hurt them.

08:00.021 --> 08:02.356
Even when
what you're telling them is the truth.

08:02.440 --> 08:06.152
I still should've told you.
You had the right to know.

08:07.528 --> 08:09.697
I think maybe I did know.
Deep down, I knew.

08:09.780 --> 08:13.784
I just hoped, if I didn't think about it,
maybe somehow, it wouldn't be true.

08:15.620 --> 08:18.831
But he's gone. He's really gone.

08:18.915 --> 08:20.500
[sobbing]

08:30.510 --> 08:32.512
[Viren snoring]

08:42.980 --> 08:44.148
The fire.

08:50.321 --> 08:51.322
Huh.

09:04.585 --> 09:05.503
[gasps]

09:16.055 --> 09:17.098
No, no, no!

09:20.268 --> 09:22.520
[exhales and groans]

09:23.271 --> 09:24.522
Who are you?

09:26.315 --> 09:28.067
When Soren said that Dad wanted us home,

09:28.150 --> 09:29.902
-you knew he was lying.
-Yeah.

09:29.986 --> 09:33.322
Unless, maybe Soren
was also trying to protect our feelings.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.741
Oh, right. He definitely seems like

09:35.825 --> 09:39.412
a thoughtful, sensitive,
feelings-y, protect-y kind of guy.

09:39.495 --> 09:42.164
Yeah, you're right,
that's not really his style.

09:42.248 --> 09:44.750
We don't have a choice anymore.
We have to leave.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.419
And we have to do it now.

09:46.502 --> 09:50.131
Get as far away from them as we can
before they even realize we're gone.

09:50.214 --> 09:52.883
Whoa, wait a minute.
They're still my friends.

09:52.967 --> 09:54.176
But they lied to you.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.846
Soren lied to me.
Claudia told me the truth.

09:56.929 --> 09:58.389
-We can't just leave.
-[Claudia] Leave?

10:00.391 --> 10:04.937
Yeah. I'm sorry, but we've decided.
We're leaving today.

10:05.021 --> 10:07.982
This mission,
taking the Dragon Prince back to Xadia,

10:08.065 --> 10:10.526
it's the most important thing
we'll ever do.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.903
-We can't go home with you.
-Oh.

10:15.323 --> 10:18.701
Are you sure? I mean,
your dad is gonna be really disappointed.

10:18.784 --> 10:22.413
-Soren, what is wrong with you?
-I'm just trying to--

10:22.496 --> 10:24.457
Don't! Stop it, Soren.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.586
Ugh, fine. Do what you want.

10:33.049 --> 10:35.009
[yelping]

10:35.926 --> 10:37.345
Stupid moths.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.097
I'm sorry about him.

10:40.181 --> 10:42.725
But before you go, Callum,

10:42.808 --> 10:46.562
I have something I need to give you.
In private.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.607
Oh. Uh, all right.

10:55.112 --> 10:58.240
So, closed door? Open door?
What's... What do you...

10:58.324 --> 11:00.117
Uh, closed is fine.

11:00.201 --> 11:02.745
Closed. Good. Okay.

11:04.664 --> 11:09.001
I have something for you.
Something you dropped.

11:09.752 --> 11:13.047
That's my letter. From him.

11:14.256 --> 11:15.091
You didn't open it?

11:15.174 --> 11:18.135
Why would I do that?
It's for you.

11:19.303 --> 11:22.139
Though, I mean, for the record,
I could have opened it

11:22.223 --> 11:24.141
and pretty easily
re-sealed it with magic.

11:24.225 --> 11:25.518
Wait, did you?

11:25.601 --> 11:27.770
Did I? We may never know.

11:27.853 --> 11:28.979
But, no. No.

11:30.398 --> 11:34.068
So, are you going to open it?

11:34.610 --> 11:36.654
No. I don't think I'm ready yet.

11:37.655 --> 11:38.948
But thank you, Claudia.

11:40.366 --> 11:41.492
You're welcome.

11:42.410 --> 11:45.621
So, I guess this is goodbye.

11:52.711 --> 11:55.673
Zym, come on.
You loved it in there as an egg.

11:56.924 --> 11:57.758
Rayla, look.

11:57.842 --> 11:59.009
[laughs]

11:59.093 --> 12:02.221
He can't fly yet,
but he should be safe in...

12:04.890 --> 12:07.560
-[Zym growls]
-Hey, how'd you...

12:08.769 --> 12:10.813
-Bait, you're not helping.
-[croaks]

12:10.896 --> 12:12.523
[Rayla laughing]

12:14.984 --> 12:17.278
Let me guess. Once I was gone,

12:17.361 --> 12:21.073
she tried to manipulate you
and convince you to go back home again.

12:21.157 --> 12:22.408
No, she didn't.

12:22.491 --> 12:24.160
Actually, Claudia really understands

12:24.243 --> 12:26.495
how important it is
to get Zym back to Xadia.

12:26.579 --> 12:29.415
Oh. That's surprising.

12:29.498 --> 12:30.708
-[Callum] Mmm-hmm.
-But good.

12:30.791 --> 12:36.630
Yeah. In fact, she understands it so well
that she and Soren want to come with us.

12:37.339 --> 12:40.176
What? That is the worst possible plan.

12:40.259 --> 12:42.595
How? How is it bad?
They're offering to help.

12:42.678 --> 12:44.472
Or it's a trap.

12:45.723 --> 12:46.557
[sighs]

12:46.640 --> 12:50.019
[sighs] Callum, I know you trust them.

12:50.519 --> 12:52.229
But if we let them come with us,

12:52.313 --> 12:55.149
by the time we know the truth,
it'll be too late.

12:56.192 --> 12:59.528
Do you understand? We'll lose everything.

13:00.112 --> 13:01.947
So, then what are we supposed to do?

13:02.031 --> 13:05.159
How can we figure out
if it's help or a trap?

13:14.919 --> 13:18.047
-[loud banging]
-Can I help you?

13:20.799 --> 13:23.260
I'm sorry.
Were you meditating or something?

13:23.344 --> 13:24.178
I was.

13:25.971 --> 13:27.681
So, you're done. Good.

13:29.475 --> 13:34.522
We're leaving. And the other humans,
they're coming with us.

13:35.105 --> 13:38.067
Hmm. And you're unhappy with that.

13:38.150 --> 13:41.987
Callum trusts them,
but I know they're hiding something.

13:42.738 --> 13:47.826
You see, to every truth,
there is a dark, shadowed side.

13:48.577 --> 13:51.539
-Consider the half moon--
-You already did this.

13:51.622 --> 13:55.584
Oh. Have I? Hmm.
Well, that's really all I've got.

13:55.668 --> 14:00.130
Unless you're in need of a spooky monster
or fake food. Hmm?

14:00.214 --> 14:04.301
Actually, there is something
you can do for me.

14:06.345 --> 14:07.388
[Soren] Oh, yeah.

14:08.639 --> 14:10.641
[grunting]

14:11.308 --> 14:13.018
Where are Callum and Ezran?

14:13.102 --> 14:16.981
Oh, they'll be here soon.
Ezran's still packing up his dragon.

14:17.064 --> 14:20.150
It has been a pleasure
to have you all here.

14:20.943 --> 14:24.655
I truly have enjoyed
you all sneaking past my defenses

14:24.738 --> 14:28.534
and desecrating this sacred place
these past few days.

14:28.617 --> 14:33.622
It will be lonely. Quiet...
but lonely without you.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.499
I'll miss you so much.

14:35.583 --> 14:39.670
-Ellis, you will always be welcome here.
-[barking]

14:39.753 --> 14:42.339
[laughs] And you, too, little one.

14:43.132 --> 14:47.303
You don't need the illusion any longer,
but I hope it serves as a reminder

14:47.386 --> 14:50.306
that someone
is always looking out for you.

14:54.268 --> 14:57.730
Okay, everyone's here now.
We can all hit the road.

14:58.898 --> 15:02.568
All right. Time to go to the magical land
and do whatever.

15:16.832 --> 15:19.919
So, you're ready to do this
the Soren way, right?

15:20.961 --> 15:22.755
Yes, there's no other way.

15:23.422 --> 15:26.759
Good. Then, when it's time to strike,
I'll give the signal.

15:26.842 --> 15:28.010
What's the signal?

15:28.093 --> 15:31.847
The signal is me attacking the elf.

15:31.931 --> 15:32.932
[Claudia groans]

15:37.645 --> 15:39.605
It's going to be a long journey.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.399
Let me just go around this bush-corner

15:42.483 --> 15:45.319
and see if I can find
some berries or something.

16:02.169 --> 16:03.170
[Rayla grunts]

16:03.837 --> 16:06.507
-Oh, no. It's a trap.
-Yup.

16:06.590 --> 16:08.968
But why? I thought we were friends.

16:09.051 --> 16:10.678
Sorry, but no.

16:10.761 --> 16:14.264
I'm just a nice guy
and people get the wrong idea sometimes.

16:14.932 --> 16:18.644
[sighs] You don't speak sarcasm so good,
do you?

16:18.727 --> 16:20.270
No, I do not.

16:23.065 --> 16:23.983
[yells]

16:31.240 --> 16:33.826
[chanting indistinctly]

16:38.872 --> 16:41.583
-[Ava whimpers and barks]
-Wait, Ava! Come back.

16:42.167 --> 16:43.210
[snakes hissing]

16:50.426 --> 16:51.343
[Zym whimpering]

17:01.770 --> 17:04.565
I'm sorry, little guy.
You have to come with me.

17:46.273 --> 17:47.399
[Viren gasps]

17:47.483 --> 17:50.402
You can't see me.
On your side...

17:51.737 --> 17:53.947
it's just an ordinary mirror.

17:56.450 --> 17:58.452
[Soren and Rayla grunting]

18:06.502 --> 18:08.003
What? You're running away?

18:10.380 --> 18:13.300
Hey! Do either of the tiny princes
want to fight?

18:13.383 --> 18:15.052
This elf is a coward.

18:19.473 --> 18:23.936
I'm sorry. I know this feels
like a betrayal, but I can't let you go.

18:24.019 --> 18:27.815
I have to do what's right.
I have to take you back home.

18:29.900 --> 18:32.736
Please don't give me
the silent treatment, Callum.

18:32.820 --> 18:36.740
Say something! Say you hate me.
Say anything.

18:45.999 --> 18:46.834
[gasps]

18:47.417 --> 18:51.255
Soren, something's wrong!
This is a trick!

18:51.338 --> 18:54.633
A trick? Us? No.

18:57.469 --> 18:59.388
-Sarcasm!
-Right.

19:00.514 --> 19:01.890
What did you do, elf?

19:01.974 --> 19:05.144
I can't wait for the look
on your big, stupid face

19:05.227 --> 19:06.311
when you see this.

19:07.104 --> 19:09.857
-Ellis, show them.
-[Ava barks]

19:11.150 --> 19:13.735
Here's your moment, Ava.
Moonstone collar trick.

19:24.997 --> 19:28.292
-They're illusions.
-[Soren] What?

19:29.168 --> 19:30.544
You're saying they're not real?

19:31.128 --> 19:34.131
-That's what "illusions" means, Soren.
-[Ellis laughing]

19:34.631 --> 19:36.383
[both howling]

19:37.301 --> 19:38.677
[Soren grunts]

19:40.846 --> 19:44.016
-Not even close! [laughs mockingly]
-[grunts]

19:44.099 --> 19:46.894
[panting] Where are the real princes?

19:48.854 --> 19:49.980
[Ava barks]

19:51.940 --> 19:53.942
[Ezran whooping]

19:55.903 --> 19:57.654
-[Soren] Claudia, they're getting away.
-[Rayla grunts]

19:58.614 --> 20:00.908
No, they're not.

20:01.700 --> 20:05.078
[chanting indistinctly]

20:08.373 --> 20:09.625
[all screaming]

20:18.217 --> 20:19.259
[Phoe-Phoe screeching]

20:19.968 --> 20:22.262
Claudia, please! Don't do this.

20:25.557 --> 20:26.892
[Bait croaks]

20:28.310 --> 20:30.729
-[screams]
-Stop! Let them go.

20:36.985 --> 20:38.320
What are you doing?

20:38.403 --> 20:40.572
Protecting them from you! [grunts]

20:41.740 --> 20:43.951
Big mistake, chain man.

20:45.410 --> 20:46.620
[Phoe-Phoe screeches]

21:01.760 --> 21:04.638
-[Ava barking]
-[Ellis] Goodbye! I'll miss you guys.

21:04.721 --> 21:08.100
Don't you forget about me.
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

21:12.020 --> 21:13.689
We got 'em! I was right.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.441
Yeah, you were right.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.570
I wish I wasn't. I'm sorry.

21:49.433 --> 21:50.892
[gasps]

22:08.618 --> 22:10.203
[gasps]

22:12.581 --> 22:13.457
[grunts]

22:15.542 --> 22:17.169
You know
you're going to pay for this, traitor.

22:17.252 --> 22:21.965
Traitor? General Amaya sent me
to protect the princes of Katolis,

22:22.049 --> 22:23.675
and you just tried to kidnap them.

22:23.759 --> 22:27.763
Everyone who votes "Corvus is a traitor"
raise their hand.

22:30.974 --> 22:33.185
Two against one, traitor.

22:34.394 --> 22:36.438
[muffled grunting]

22:37.355 --> 22:38.690
What are we gonna do?

22:38.774 --> 22:41.693
We betrayed our friends,
and it was all for nothing.

22:42.903 --> 22:45.030
It wasn't for nothing. Look.

22:45.947 --> 22:50.869
[gasps] The dragon!
We still have the dragon.

22:52.412 --> 22:53.789
Come on out, you little--

22:53.872 --> 22:57.751
[grunting] I hate the Moon. Ugh!

23:07.385 --> 23:09.763
It's okay, Zym.
It's safe to come out now.

23:12.891 --> 23:14.351
[growls softly]

23:19.981 --> 23:21.024
[chitters]

23:23.318 --> 23:24.361
[Ezran] We're up in the sky.

23:25.112 --> 23:26.613
[squeals]

23:27.572 --> 23:29.741
Wanna see how flying feels?

23:31.493 --> 23:33.370
Come on, spread your wings.

23:34.663 --> 23:36.164
[squeals]

23:36.248 --> 23:38.291
[laughing]

23:38.375 --> 23:40.836
[chittering]

23:40.919 --> 23:42.921
[laughing]

23:49.594 --> 23:51.471
[Ezran cheering]

23:52.139 --> 23:53.807
Yeah!
