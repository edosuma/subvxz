WEBVTT

00:03.211 --> 00:05.338
(crickets chirping)

00:16.558 --> 00:18.476
You made the call to 911?

00:18.560 --> 00:20.311
Yes. I found him.

00:20.395 --> 00:23.606
I don't know how long
he'd been lying there.

00:23.690 --> 00:24.941
If your father was
under the care

00:25.024 --> 00:26.609
of a physician,
we'll need the name.

00:26.693 --> 00:27.944
I don't know that information.

00:28.027 --> 00:29.946
Dr. Bruce Abrams.

00:30.029 --> 00:32.615
Um, he treated him
for his stroke two years ago.

00:32.698 --> 00:34.576
I can get you the number.

00:34.659 --> 00:36.286
Oh.

00:36.369 --> 00:37.537
I'm sorry for your loss.

00:43.501 --> 00:47.505
It's okay. I'll call information
for Dr. Abrams' number.

00:48.715 --> 00:51.801
Did you hear anything
before you came in the room?

00:51.885 --> 00:54.637
I was making fun of the tie
he picked out for dinner.

00:54.721 --> 00:58.016
I went to the bathroom
to get ready.

00:58.099 --> 00:59.559
I turned on the water
for a second,

00:59.642 --> 01:01.478
but if he would have called out
to me,

01:01.561 --> 01:02.562
I definitely
would have heard him.

01:02.645 --> 01:04.688
(sniffles)
What happens now?

01:04.772 --> 01:07.442
If the physician will sign off
on cause of death,

01:07.525 --> 01:09.068
you can contact a mortuary.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.280
Dr. Abrams' service
is paging him.

01:12.363 --> 01:13.990
MAN:
From all indications,

01:14.073 --> 01:15.700
your father suffered a stroke.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.663
(crying)

01:20.747 --> 01:22.916
Oh, no-- here.
It's my mom.

01:27.420 --> 01:30.340
Donna, what's happening? What?

01:30.423 --> 01:32.133
Mommy, they think
Daddy had a stroke.

01:34.427 --> 01:35.887
How is he?!

01:37.096 --> 01:38.515
(screaming):
No!

01:38.598 --> 01:40.517
No, Mom, please, you don't want
to go in there. Mom...

01:40.600 --> 01:42.310
Why is everybody just standing
around? Do something!

01:42.393 --> 01:44.813
I want to see my husband!

03:41.554 --> 03:43.139
Okay.

03:43.222 --> 03:46.434
I don't remember smashing
the windshield at all.

03:46.517 --> 03:47.518
Look, I know
this isn't the best time

03:47.602 --> 03:50.647
to tell you guys
this, but, uh...

03:50.730 --> 03:52.649
Donna's dad died last night.

03:52.732 --> 03:55.109
He had a stroke.

03:55.193 --> 03:56.486
Gina was there.

03:56.569 --> 03:58.279
She saw her father die?

03:58.363 --> 03:59.572
Yeah, I guess she did.

04:00.865 --> 04:02.158
How's Donna?

04:02.241 --> 04:03.910
Well, Janet went to see her.

04:03.993 --> 04:05.620
I came to tell you guys.

04:06.788 --> 04:08.831
All set.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.750
What'd you do, hit a tree limb?

04:10.833 --> 04:11.626
No.

04:11.709 --> 04:13.586
Cut an angry housewife
off at the pass?

04:13.670 --> 04:14.379
That happened to me once.

04:14.462 --> 04:16.464
Two thugs dragged me out
of my car,

04:16.547 --> 04:18.882
handcuffed me, stuck a gun
in my face for two days.

04:18.966 --> 04:19.884
Noah, come on.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.052
Got any more questions?

04:23.721 --> 04:24.472
Listen, tell Donna something.

04:24.555 --> 04:26.641
I'm not going to be able
to make it.

04:26.724 --> 04:27.809
Don't worry about that.

04:27.892 --> 04:29.477
Don't tell her about
Shane and Josie.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.604
-I don't want her to worry.
-All right.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.650
Come on,
I'll give you a ride home.

04:35.733 --> 04:36.859
All right.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.361
See you guys later.

04:41.614 --> 04:43.074
JANET:
How's your mom?

04:43.157 --> 04:46.369
In a state of shock, I think.

04:47.620 --> 04:50.164
I told her I'd be back
by 10:00, but um,

04:50.248 --> 04:52.709
there's so much to take care of.

04:52.792 --> 04:55.003
I just figured it was better
to make phone calls from here.

04:59.465 --> 05:00.842
So, how do you plan a funeral?

05:00.925 --> 05:02.760
Well, why don't we get you
straightened out first?

05:02.844 --> 05:05.221
I have to go by
the office anyway,

05:05.304 --> 05:06.764
so do you want me
to put a sign up

05:06.848 --> 05:07.849
saying you're closed
for the week?

05:07.932 --> 05:09.017
I talked to Camille.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.560
She said she'd take care
of the store,

05:10.643 --> 05:11.310
if that's all right with you.

05:11.394 --> 05:13.062
Yeah, that'd be great.
Thanks.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.857
It's kind of weird.

05:15.940 --> 05:19.193
Yesterday he was fine, and...

05:19.277 --> 05:21.946
and now he's gone.

05:28.828 --> 05:30.496
Was he supposed to exercise?

05:31.831 --> 05:33.291
Meaning...?

05:33.374 --> 05:36.586
I was just wondering what
the physician said, that's all.

05:36.669 --> 05:40.590
They don't know what brought
about the stroke.

05:41.674 --> 05:44.719
I'm gonna get some air.

05:46.679 --> 05:48.556
(door closing)

06:03.029 --> 06:04.655
I feel like I'm invisible.

06:04.739 --> 06:07.116
Donna's just dealing with a lot
of responsibilities right now.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.410
I feel like I'm not even
allowed to be sad.

06:09.494 --> 06:12.163
A man died and you were there.

06:12.246 --> 06:14.957
It may be totally irrational,

06:15.041 --> 06:16.459
but some people are
just wondering

06:16.542 --> 06:18.294
if maybe something else
could have been done.

06:18.377 --> 06:20.630
A man died.

06:23.716 --> 06:25.384
He was my father.

06:26.552 --> 06:29.514
And the people who are wondering
are Felice and Kelly

06:29.597 --> 06:32.475
and everyone else who thinks
that I'm to blame for his death.

06:32.558 --> 06:34.811
No one said they blamed you.

06:34.894 --> 06:37.146
In this group,
no one has to.

06:43.069 --> 06:45.029
Do you need a license
to be a personal trainer?

06:45.113 --> 06:47.281
-Kelly...
-I'm just asking.

06:47.365 --> 06:49.200
I know what you're asking.

06:49.283 --> 06:53.246
And you're not making anything
easier for Donna by asking it.

06:53.329 --> 06:56.833
Donna made it possible for Gina

06:56.916 --> 06:59.961
to even have a relationship
with Dr. Martin.

07:00.044 --> 07:01.963
She pushed for it.

07:04.423 --> 07:08.636
So, tell me about this
job offer of yours.

07:08.719 --> 07:11.973
It's a potential job.
It's a good one.

07:12.056 --> 07:14.517
You said it came through
that annoying woman

07:14.600 --> 07:16.727
you hired to promote the store?

07:16.811 --> 07:19.689
Pia is with
a big P.R. agency now.

07:19.772 --> 07:24.485
They have accounts ranging from
high-tech to public interest.

07:24.569 --> 07:26.487
I mean, I'd get an overview

07:26.571 --> 07:28.239
of a lot of different
industries.

07:28.322 --> 07:30.867
It's good money and, certainly,
Pia is charming.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.910
Wait a minute. This is my space.

07:34.954 --> 07:37.498
There are 14 minutes left
on this meter here.

07:37.582 --> 07:38.916
Oh, no, someone
stole your car?

07:39.000 --> 07:40.751
-A little green sports car?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:40.835 --> 07:42.461
I tried to stop them.

07:42.545 --> 07:43.671
Stop who? Did you call the cops?

07:43.754 --> 07:46.048
You got hit by the repo man.

07:46.132 --> 07:48.384
The same thing happened
to my little brother.

07:48.467 --> 07:49.886
Struggling painter.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.429
He's not very talented.

07:51.512 --> 07:53.556
Hey, listen, I am
an attorney, pal.

07:53.639 --> 07:56.601
I spent three years and about
100 grand on law school--

07:56.684 --> 07:58.352
for this.

08:00.855 --> 08:03.900
(sighs, groans)

08:03.983 --> 08:05.860
Are you sure you don't want
to call the police

08:05.943 --> 08:07.069
and make sure it wasn't stolen?

08:07.153 --> 08:10.031
No, I got a call
from a creditor last week.

08:10.114 --> 08:11.407
I thought we talked about
the finance issue.

08:11.490 --> 08:12.575
We agreed to be
up-front about it.

08:12.658 --> 08:13.701
You know I'm out of work.

08:13.784 --> 08:15.786
I mean, do I have to give you
a daily reminder of it?

08:15.870 --> 08:17.997
Or maybe this did the trick.

08:23.669 --> 08:26.547
Hey.
Um, Donna's at her mom's

08:26.631 --> 08:29.258
and I just offered to stay here
and, you know, watch the phone

08:29.342 --> 08:31.093
in case any of the family
calls or anything.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.429
I mean, she said that she'd
leave her cell phone

08:33.511 --> 08:35.014
on the outgoing machine,
but I just figured,

08:35.097 --> 08:36.599
you know,
people really want to...

08:36.682 --> 08:39.393
I'm sorry about your dad.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.816
I screwed up.

08:45.900 --> 08:49.237
I don't believe it.
Do you?

08:49.320 --> 08:51.447
I don't know,
I checked his pulse.

08:51.530 --> 08:53.783
I always tried to make sure

08:53.866 --> 08:55.618
he wasn't overexerting himself,
but...

08:55.701 --> 08:57.620
Aw, come on. He was a doctor.

08:57.703 --> 08:59.121
If he didn't know
it was going to happen,

08:59.205 --> 09:01.290
there is no way
that you could have.

09:01.374 --> 09:05.461
Yeah, but I knew he didn't want
to work out.

09:05.544 --> 09:07.964
He just wanted to spend time
with me.

09:08.047 --> 09:10.841
Because you walked into his life
and said,

09:10.925 --> 09:13.719
"Hey, I'm your daughter.

09:13.803 --> 09:17.265
And I forgive you."

09:17.348 --> 09:19.684
Do you have any idea what that
must have meant to him?

09:27.275 --> 09:28.651
FELICE: <i> Sweetheart, you should</i>
<i>eat something.</i>

09:28.734 --> 09:31.988
I think there's some quiche
in the fridge.

09:32.071 --> 09:33.531
No, thanks. I'm fine.

09:33.614 --> 09:35.157
Did you find his life insurance?

09:35.241 --> 09:37.159
'Cause the funeral director said
it usually covers expenses.

09:37.243 --> 09:38.452
No, no, I didn't.

09:38.536 --> 09:40.621
It's okay, I'll look.

09:45.084 --> 09:48.504
Are you sure Dad never mentioned
what unit of the Army he was in?

09:48.587 --> 09:50.006
That was right out
of high school,

09:50.089 --> 09:51.549
before we met in college.

09:51.632 --> 09:54.343
We need it to get the flag
from the V.A. for his coffin.

09:54.427 --> 09:57.346
His coffin.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.640
I can't even look
at his side of the bed.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.520
What about his date book--
there's people we should call.

10:04.603 --> 10:05.855
I don't know.

10:05.938 --> 10:07.148
Donna, I don't know.

10:07.231 --> 10:09.525
I don't know if the mortgage
has been paid.

10:09.608 --> 10:11.193
I don't know where
his checkbook is.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.195
I-I don't know anything!

10:13.279 --> 10:15.072
Mommy...

10:16.741 --> 10:18.909
It's okay. We can do this.

10:18.993 --> 10:22.038
No, we can't.

10:22.121 --> 10:23.831
We have to.

10:23.914 --> 10:25.499
(doorbell ringing)

10:25.583 --> 10:27.710
I'll get it.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.554
Hi.

10:38.637 --> 10:40.723
Donna, I'm sorry.

10:40.806 --> 10:42.224
Thanks.

10:43.934 --> 10:46.562
Delivery guy
just dropped this off.

10:46.645 --> 10:48.564
Thanks.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.776
It's from Nat.

10:51.859 --> 10:55.404
He took Joanie on a cruise,
and he's offering to fly back.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.365
Everyone's been so nice.

11:00.034 --> 11:01.577
You know, I'm always surprised

11:01.660 --> 11:04.246
people think you want to eat
in this situation.

11:04.330 --> 11:07.541
Yeah, the weird thing is,
you do.

11:07.625 --> 11:10.461
You suffer this huge loss,

11:10.544 --> 11:13.047
but everything just kinda stays
the same.

11:13.130 --> 11:14.256
I sit in traffic,

11:14.340 --> 11:18.886
I... I hear my favorite song
on your show.

11:18.969 --> 11:21.722
(voice breaking):
Thank you for that.

11:21.806 --> 11:24.266
You're welcome.

11:24.350 --> 11:25.684
Mmm.

11:26.519 --> 11:27.561
(Donna sighs)

11:27.645 --> 11:29.480
He's gonna be buried
in two days.

11:29.563 --> 11:31.440
I'll help you get through this,
okay?

11:31.524 --> 11:33.109
(sighs)

11:33.192 --> 11:35.694
And then what?

11:37.488 --> 11:40.991
You guys have your own lives.

11:41.075 --> 11:44.662
This was my family.

11:44.745 --> 11:47.415
Without my dad, I don't know
what we are anymore.

11:47.498 --> 11:49.291
You're still a family, Donna.

11:49.375 --> 11:50.459
That doesn't change.

11:50.543 --> 11:51.544
Doesn't it?

11:52.711 --> 11:53.921
(sniffles)
My mom, she's...

11:54.004 --> 11:58.968
she's freaking out
about day-to-day things

11:59.051 --> 12:03.472
that my dad took care of.

12:03.556 --> 12:06.308
But what he took care of best
was her.

12:06.392 --> 12:08.769
And I tried.

12:08.853 --> 12:11.814
I tell her we're gonna be fine,
we're gonna get through this.

12:13.399 --> 12:16.152
(voice breaking): But it just
feels like such a pathetic lie.

12:18.446 --> 12:19.572
(sobs)

12:39.592 --> 12:41.510
I hate talking about money.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.137
I noticed.

12:56.275 --> 12:57.860
Here's the thing:

12:57.943 --> 13:00.404
I want you to trust that I'm
in control of my finances.

13:00.488 --> 13:05.034
The hard part is,
because of the suspension,

13:05.117 --> 13:08.037
I'm basically starting
at ground zero with clients.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.706
I have money from my share
of the store.

13:10.789 --> 13:11.707
If you need any--

13:11.790 --> 13:13.584
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

13:13.667 --> 13:17.129
Please do not finish
that sentence.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.468
I love you so much,

13:22.551 --> 13:25.638
but you have no idea
how guys define themselves.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.849
I had a good job at a big firm.

13:28.933 --> 13:29.850
Which you hated.

13:29.934 --> 13:33.395
But maybe that's what we need
to feel secure.

13:34.355 --> 13:35.981
We're getting married.

13:36.065 --> 13:37.566
And starting a life together.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.402
A life you'll want to live,
a job you'll want to go to.

13:40.486 --> 13:41.737
And the same applies to you.

13:41.820 --> 13:43.239
I don't want you to take

13:43.322 --> 13:45.908
this P.R. job because you think
you need to hold me up.

13:45.991 --> 13:50.454
It hasn't been offered yet,
but it is interesting.

13:54.833 --> 13:56.585
I believe in you.

13:56.669 --> 14:00.005
We're gonna be fine.

14:06.887 --> 14:09.306
Are you okay?

14:10.516 --> 14:13.269
No.

14:13.352 --> 14:16.605
It's not the answer
you were hoping for, is it?

14:22.528 --> 14:23.487
I'm so sorry.

14:25.489 --> 14:28.659
Did you know that when John
was in high school

14:28.742 --> 14:32.955
he was, uh... an usher at
the Orpheum Theater downtown?

14:33.038 --> 14:34.582
No, I didn't know that.

14:34.665 --> 14:36.584
I read it in his obituary.

14:36.667 --> 14:39.336
Guess a reporter had called
his brother,

14:39.420 --> 14:40.629
and he mentioned it.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.965
To find out something
about your husband

14:43.048 --> 14:44.592
after all these years...

14:44.675 --> 14:47.094
I thought the article was
really nice.

14:47.177 --> 14:48.470
Yeah.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.180
(voice breaks):
I wish...

14:50.264 --> 14:52.808
Well, it's just that they said

14:52.891 --> 14:56.061
he was survived by his wife
and his one daughter.

14:56.145 --> 14:57.771
For heaven's sake, Gina,

14:57.855 --> 14:59.607
what difference does it
make now?

14:59.690 --> 15:02.026
Well, he was my father.

15:02.109 --> 15:04.945
Well, he was my life.

15:05.029 --> 15:07.448
What, do you want to destroy
his reputation

15:07.531 --> 15:09.950
now that he's not here
to explain to everyone

15:10.034 --> 15:12.995
what a stupid, thoughtless
mistake he made?

15:13.078 --> 15:16.040
He didn't see it that way.

15:16.123 --> 15:18.042
He didn't, he didn't see me
that way.

15:18.125 --> 15:20.711
Well, damn it, Gina,
this is not about you!

15:20.794 --> 15:21.795
Don't you see

15:21.879 --> 15:25.341
how one careless moment can
destroy everything?

15:25.424 --> 15:28.510
I mean, did you check
his blood pressure?!

15:28.594 --> 15:30.346
Please don't do this.

15:30.429 --> 15:31.847
Did you think at all?!

15:31.930 --> 15:33.265
Did you think?!

15:41.607 --> 15:43.400
(rock music playing)

15:43.484 --> 15:45.361
STEVE:
Hey, how's it going, Noah?

15:45.444 --> 15:47.196
(sighs)
Where's Madeline tonight?

15:47.279 --> 15:49.365
She's staying with my mom
and dad.

15:49.448 --> 15:50.991
We just came here to unwind.

15:51.075 --> 15:53.994
And to see if you wanted
to come over

15:54.078 --> 15:55.162
for dinner sometime.

15:55.245 --> 15:56.664
Yeah, how about tomorrow night?

15:56.747 --> 15:58.040
I appreciate what you're doing,

15:58.123 --> 16:00.709
but you don't have
to worry about me, you know?

16:00.793 --> 16:03.045
What happened was pretty weird,
but, uh...

16:03.128 --> 16:05.214
-But what?
-Look at it, you know?

16:05.297 --> 16:08.425
I mean, this former child star
abducts me at gunpoint, right?

16:08.509 --> 16:10.678
I was thinking about it.

16:10.761 --> 16:12.554
I mean, can I actually die
like this?

16:12.638 --> 16:16.350
After all was said and done,
I mean, yeah...

16:16.433 --> 16:18.560
I could've died like that.

16:19.687 --> 16:21.563
It's a pretty good way
to go, right?

16:26.652 --> 16:27.736
Tell me something.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.905
Do you get a rush
out of testing yourself,

16:29.988 --> 16:32.074
or is it just a test
for your friends,

16:32.157 --> 16:33.409
keep us on our toes?

16:33.492 --> 16:35.369
Yeah, that's right,
'cause it's all about you.

16:35.452 --> 16:37.746
I-I'd like to know what it is,
risking everything

16:37.830 --> 16:39.081
so you can feel something.

16:39.164 --> 16:40.332
Look, just for the record,

16:40.416 --> 16:43.293
I didn't volunteer to go out
playing Russian roulette, okay?

16:43.377 --> 16:45.796
I was sitting home watching
the tip-off of the Laker game

16:45.879 --> 16:46.672
when Noah got kidnapped.

16:46.755 --> 16:49.258
-What?
-So I laid down a lot of cash,

16:49.341 --> 16:51.927
and incidentally, risked my life
to try to get him back.

16:52.010 --> 16:53.387
And you know what?
It wasn't fun,

16:53.470 --> 16:55.931
it wasn't sexy;
I wouldn't try it at home, kids.

16:56.014 --> 16:58.058
Dylan, I had no idea.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.268
Oh, that's okay.

16:59.351 --> 17:01.103
The, uh, real bright spot was,

17:01.186 --> 17:03.105
as my life flashed
before my eyes,

17:03.188 --> 17:05.065
your lectures went by
a lot quicker.

17:12.030 --> 17:14.450
I'm sorry I called you so late.

17:14.532 --> 17:15.325
Mmm, I'm not.

17:15.409 --> 17:17.618
How much sleep did you get
last night?

17:17.703 --> 17:21.373
Two, three hours?

17:24.542 --> 17:26.336
So, did you try a hot bath?

17:26.420 --> 17:29.298
Hot bath, chamomile tea--

17:29.381 --> 17:32.301
nothing-- so I just
finally got up.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.303
You set up camp, huh?

17:34.386 --> 17:36.472
Yeah.

17:38.599 --> 17:42.019
(Donna sighs)

17:42.102 --> 17:44.688
You know, when I was a kid,

17:44.772 --> 17:47.649
I would climb
into my parents' bed

17:47.733 --> 17:53.197
with my favorite book,
<i>Charlotte's Web.</i>

17:53.280 --> 17:59.286
And my dad, he would, he would
turn the pages, but...

17:59.369 --> 18:02.331
I swear he knew every word
by heart.

18:02.414 --> 18:04.792
(David laughs gently)

18:04.875 --> 18:05.876
Well, that's unconditional love.

18:05.959 --> 18:07.086
Your mom hates spiders.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.839
Yeah.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.008
He kept reading.

18:13.091 --> 18:15.511
She never complained.

18:15.594 --> 18:19.598
Then I'd lean against him.

18:19.681 --> 18:23.685
She'd stroke my hair
till I fell asleep.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.366
(knocking)

18:40.285 --> 18:41.245
Hey, what's up?

18:41.328 --> 18:45.415
Nothing new. How about you?

18:45.499 --> 18:48.836
(sighs) Well...

18:48.919 --> 18:51.588
I saw Felice tonight.

18:51.672 --> 18:53.006
DYLAN:
Hm.

18:53.090 --> 18:55.050
She blames me
for her husband's death.

18:55.134 --> 18:58.095
Your father, you mean.

18:58.178 --> 19:00.055
Gina, the man was
still your father.

19:00.138 --> 19:02.516
Felice is just a little
out of her head right now.

19:02.599 --> 19:03.934
Yeah, well, even in
her weakest hour,

19:04.017 --> 19:05.227
that woman can make me
hate myself.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.645
(sighs)
Don't buy into it.

19:06.728 --> 19:10.399
I don't know what it is
about this town, you know?

19:10.482 --> 19:12.025
Doesn't matter how hard you try,

19:12.109 --> 19:15.863
eventually, you just are
what people say you are.

19:15.946 --> 19:18.949
Had a taste of that myself
this evening,

19:19.032 --> 19:21.577
and, uh, I didn't like it much.

19:21.660 --> 19:25.831
Got me to thinking we should,
uh, go somewhere else.

19:27.749 --> 19:30.252
Where would you like to live?

19:30.335 --> 19:32.004
You mean for good?

19:32.087 --> 19:34.214
That's the plan.

19:34.298 --> 19:37.217
Count me in.

19:47.394 --> 19:49.104
PIA:
<i>That's it for salary.</i>

19:49.187 --> 19:51.440
We'll review medical and pension
when you start.

19:51.523 --> 19:53.483
So, it's official.

19:53.567 --> 19:55.777
And long overdue.

19:55.861 --> 19:57.321
Welcome to the world of P.R.

19:57.404 --> 19:58.405
Thank you.

19:58.488 --> 20:00.282
Wow, it happened so quickly.

20:00.365 --> 20:02.618
Well, you're creative
and talented.

20:02.701 --> 20:03.952
And I've seen the energy

20:04.036 --> 20:06.747
you put behind things
you're committed to.

20:06.830 --> 20:09.207
I'm glad to hear you say that,
because believing in

20:09.291 --> 20:12.169
what I'm working on
is very important to me.

20:12.252 --> 20:13.420
Not that I'm worried
or anything.

20:13.503 --> 20:14.963
I've seen
your company's client list.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.757
I know that you guys are great.

20:16.840 --> 20:18.175
But, um, still I'm curious

20:18.258 --> 20:19.968
what my first assignment's
going to be.

20:20.052 --> 20:22.137
Helping to pass
a ballot initiative.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.263
A ballot initiative.

20:23.347 --> 20:25.307
So that's something that people
in California are going

20:25.390 --> 20:26.683
to be voting on
in the next election?

20:26.767 --> 20:29.186
Yeah. We've been hired
as campaign consultants.

20:29.269 --> 20:31.188
Oh, interesting.
What's the issue?

20:31.271 --> 20:33.523
Gay student clubs in
public high schools.

20:33.607 --> 20:36.109
It's an issue of funding
and personal rights,

20:36.193 --> 20:37.653
morality versus freedom--
you get the drill.

20:37.736 --> 20:39.071
How do you feel about that?

20:39.154 --> 20:41.448
I feel very passionately
about it.

20:41.531 --> 20:42.824
That's the perfect place
to start.

20:42.908 --> 20:44.910
Oh! Gotta run.

20:44.993 --> 20:46.995
I'll messenger you
the campaign details

20:47.079 --> 20:48.288
and then we'll talk.

20:48.372 --> 20:49.289
-Okay.
-Okay.

20:49.373 --> 20:51.208
-Great. Bye.
-Bye-bye.

20:53.460 --> 20:54.378
That's my new boss.

20:54.461 --> 20:56.505
She just hired me to work
at her P.R. firm.

20:56.588 --> 20:58.298
Mm, P.R. firm.

20:58.382 --> 21:00.217
I knew you were looking
for something.

21:00.300 --> 21:01.385
I hope this is it.

21:01.468 --> 21:03.387
Yeah.

21:03.470 --> 21:06.807
Listen, about last night,
I... said you were reckless;

21:06.890 --> 21:09.142
and if I had known what
had happened,

21:09.226 --> 21:10.519
I would have never said that.

21:10.602 --> 21:13.689
Whatever. I just wanted
to let you know that

21:13.772 --> 21:15.691
after the funeral,
I'm going to be leaving.

21:15.774 --> 21:17.401
I'm trying to say I'm sorry.

21:17.484 --> 21:18.568
Did you hear what I said?

21:18.652 --> 21:20.862
After the funeral,
I'm gonna leave.

21:22.155 --> 21:23.615
See, I've been looking
for something, too.

21:23.699 --> 21:25.200
And you don't think it's here?

21:25.283 --> 21:26.493
Not anymore.

21:33.792 --> 21:36.211
DONNA: <i> Thanks for coming back</i>
<i>this morning.</i>

21:36.294 --> 21:37.879
The funeral home's
on Third and Montana.

21:37.963 --> 21:39.548
You sure you don't mind
doing this?

21:39.631 --> 21:40.590
Course not.

21:40.674 --> 21:43.510
Thanks.

21:43.593 --> 21:45.554
I hope you know how much
I appreciate

21:45.637 --> 21:47.472
you being here for me.

21:52.477 --> 21:53.562
DAVID:
It's perfect timing.

21:53.645 --> 21:56.565
You can hang out here with Donna
while I, uh, take off.

21:56.648 --> 21:57.357
I gotta...

21:57.441 --> 21:59.860
Actually,
if you have a second,

21:59.943 --> 22:01.445
I want to talk to both of you.

22:01.528 --> 22:02.904
What's up?

22:08.326 --> 22:13.165
Well, I've decided to leave L.A.

22:14.416 --> 22:15.709
Now?

22:15.792 --> 22:18.503
After the funeral, of course.

22:20.464 --> 22:22.966
You've been really great to me
the last few months,

22:23.050 --> 22:24.259
and so has Dad,

22:24.342 --> 22:26.261
and I just wanted to say
thank you for that.

22:26.344 --> 22:30.432
I just wish I could say the same
for everyone else.

22:30.515 --> 22:31.308
You can.

22:31.391 --> 22:33.310
Well, you did say
I killed my father.

22:33.393 --> 22:34.394
I said people wondered

22:34.478 --> 22:36.605
if everything that could've
been done was done.

22:36.688 --> 22:37.606
It was.

22:37.689 --> 22:39.608
Fine, Gina. End of story.

22:39.691 --> 22:41.610
GINA:
Not for Felice.

22:41.693 --> 22:43.236
And maybe not for you, either.

22:43.320 --> 22:44.571
Just trying to get through
this right now.

22:44.654 --> 22:45.822
Well, so am I, you know,

22:45.906 --> 22:47.365
and it's really hard knowing
that people

22:47.449 --> 22:48.283
could actually be
suspicious of me.

22:48.366 --> 22:49.868
I'm sure it is.

22:49.951 --> 22:51.286
That's really not the answer
that I was looking for.

22:51.369 --> 22:52.162
Well, I'm sorry, Gina,

22:52.245 --> 22:53.830
but, right now,
I really can't comfort--

22:53.914 --> 22:56.166
Well, I'm sorry, but he was
my father, too.

22:56.249 --> 22:58.835
And if you hadn't found that
out, maybe he'd still be alive.

23:02.881 --> 23:05.133
So, you do think it's my fault.

23:05.217 --> 23:06.843
I don't know whose fault it is,

23:06.927 --> 23:08.637
and right now,
I really don't care.

23:18.021 --> 23:20.232
If you are going to leave

23:20.315 --> 23:22.109
then I don't want our
bitching and moaning

23:22.192 --> 23:24.653
or the ridiculous amount of pain
that we inflict on each other

23:24.736 --> 23:28.532
to obscure the fact that
you're one of my best friends.

23:29.950 --> 23:31.993
And I'm going to miss you.

23:32.077 --> 23:34.704
There, I said it.

23:34.788 --> 23:37.207
-Now where are you going?
-We were thinking South America.

23:37.290 --> 23:39.376
Hear it's really pretty
this time of year.

23:39.459 --> 23:41.002
We?

23:41.086 --> 23:42.045
Yeah, me and Gina.

23:42.129 --> 23:44.464
Huh!
She didn't grieve long.

23:44.548 --> 23:45.799
Hey, don't do that.

23:45.882 --> 23:47.551
What were you saying,
just a minute ago,

23:47.634 --> 23:48.885
about, uh, inflicting pain?

23:48.969 --> 23:51.388
I want to be happy for you.

23:51.471 --> 23:53.348
If I felt like you were running
toward something

23:53.431 --> 23:55.350
instead of running away
from something.

23:55.433 --> 23:58.353
Or could it be that me leaving
narrows your options?

23:58.436 --> 23:59.729
By the way, how is Matt?

23:59.813 --> 24:01.398
Go to hell.

24:03.483 --> 24:07.279
Oh, believe me,
it's on the itinerary.

24:11.116 --> 24:12.534
(rock music blaring)

24:12.617 --> 24:16.913
Noah, what are you doing?

24:16.997 --> 24:19.124
Noah?

24:21.710 --> 24:23.086
(music stops)

24:24.504 --> 24:25.755
Hey.

24:26.756 --> 24:29.176
Hey.

24:32.637 --> 24:35.849
Why don't we just try
talking instead?

24:35.932 --> 24:37.475
(Noah scoffs)

24:37.559 --> 24:41.229
This little piggy went
to the liquor store.

24:41.313 --> 24:44.232
And this little piggy right
here, well, he stayed home.

24:44.316 --> 24:49.237
And this little piggy right here
had a scotch and water.

24:49.321 --> 24:52.199
Let me guess, this little piggy
right here had none.

24:52.282 --> 24:56.077
And this little piggy
right here...

24:56.161 --> 24:58.330
Let me tell you about him.

25:03.335 --> 25:06.213
See, he got to actually hear

25:06.296 --> 25:08.381
his father blow his brains
right out.

25:08.465 --> 25:12.135
Well, that little piggy right
there-- it's not the answer.

25:12.219 --> 25:13.511
One shot.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.432
Pop.

25:19.643 --> 25:21.603
I hope I'm that good
when my time comes.

25:21.686 --> 25:23.563
Stop.

25:23.647 --> 25:25.649
All right, Noah, just stop.

25:27.067 --> 25:29.778
Here it is-- this right here
is your turn,

25:29.861 --> 25:32.656
and yay, Noah, you're
killing yourself.

25:34.324 --> 25:36.451
You have any idea
what you're talking about?

25:36.534 --> 25:38.286
It's like some kind of curse.

25:38.370 --> 25:39.287
The whole family's...

25:39.371 --> 25:43.250
I do, Noah. I know exactly

25:43.333 --> 25:45.418
what you're talking about.

25:45.502 --> 25:47.879
And you know what?
You have a choice.

25:47.963 --> 25:52.092
The problem is, you don't find
that out until the end.

25:52.175 --> 25:53.260
It's not a curse.

25:53.343 --> 25:56.304
If you want to do it.

25:56.388 --> 25:58.306
If you want to jump or...

25:58.390 --> 25:59.599
pull the trigger...

26:01.685 --> 26:04.312
Well...

26:04.396 --> 26:06.314
(clears throat)

26:06.398 --> 26:08.733
...that responsibility's
all on you.

26:25.625 --> 26:27.335
Hi.

26:27.419 --> 26:29.296
Hey.

26:29.379 --> 26:31.214
Is it true you're leaving?

26:31.298 --> 26:34.342
That's why I, uh, came.

26:34.426 --> 26:37.012
I wanted a chance
to say good-bye.

26:37.095 --> 26:41.141
I don't think I can deal
with that right now.

26:41.224 --> 26:45.020
You know how, when you're
in one place for a long time,

26:45.103 --> 26:47.897
it's kind of hard
to notice the change?

26:47.981 --> 26:49.899
But if you go away
and you come back,

26:49.983 --> 26:52.193
you can see how different
things are.

26:52.277 --> 26:54.237
I guess.

26:54.321 --> 26:59.326
Yeah, well, when I left,
you were this...

26:59.409 --> 27:04.831
incredibly shy,
sweet, decent kid.

27:04.914 --> 27:08.835
When I came back, you'd become

27:08.918 --> 27:14.382
this capable, competent,
successful person.

27:15.508 --> 27:16.593
You're ready for this.

27:16.676 --> 27:19.012
I don't know.

27:19.095 --> 27:22.223
Right before you got here,
I was in a complete panic

27:22.307 --> 27:24.351
about what I was going
to say in church.

27:24.434 --> 27:28.229
No, I mean for the
responsibilities

27:28.313 --> 27:31.066
that will come afterward.

27:31.149 --> 27:36.196
You're a lot more prepared
than I was when my dad died.

27:36.279 --> 27:38.198
How'd you deal with it?

27:38.281 --> 27:42.077
I ran from the responsibilities.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.245
I ran from commitment.

27:44.329 --> 27:46.790
I'm still running.

27:46.873 --> 27:48.750
I don't know why.

27:48.833 --> 27:51.294
Of course you don't.

27:51.378 --> 27:55.131
And that is why
you are gonna do great.

27:55.215 --> 27:57.884
This is my home.

27:57.967 --> 28:02.555
It's where I gather
what little strength I have.

28:02.639 --> 28:04.432
Don't you feel that way?

28:04.516 --> 28:06.267
Yeah, I... I-I do.

28:06.351 --> 28:07.769
It's just with me it's...

28:07.852 --> 28:10.271
it's more of a love-hate
kind of thing.

28:10.355 --> 28:14.275
Well, I'm not telling you
not to go.

28:14.359 --> 28:18.071
But you should stop taking
what you have for granted.

28:18.154 --> 28:21.408
'Cause the more responsibilities
we have,

28:21.491 --> 28:24.786
the more help we're gonna need.

28:34.379 --> 28:35.922
All set?

28:36.005 --> 28:38.800
Yeah.

28:38.883 --> 28:40.468
I took the P.R. job.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.804
Huh.

28:42.887 --> 28:45.807
Well, I'm... I'm glad you did.

28:45.890 --> 28:48.435
Because as hard as it is

28:48.518 --> 28:51.438
for me to admit, I, uh,
I need your help.

28:53.398 --> 28:55.316
Okay.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.277
Does this say
what I think it says?

28:57.360 --> 28:58.862
What's this?

28:58.945 --> 29:01.656
Pia said we would be working
on a ballot initiative

29:01.739 --> 29:03.491
regarding gay students' rights

29:03.575 --> 29:06.202
to form their own clubs
in public high schools.

29:06.286 --> 29:08.455
She asked me
how I felt about it,

29:08.538 --> 29:10.832
and what did I say?

29:10.915 --> 29:13.293
I said I felt
passionately about it.

29:13.376 --> 29:15.336
I meant that I felt
passionately in favor

29:15.420 --> 29:16.838
of kids' rights
to express themselves.

29:16.921 --> 29:18.673
Well, that's a problem.

29:18.756 --> 29:22.343
Because you've been hired
to stop them.

29:22.427 --> 29:24.220
That's what I thought.

29:32.562 --> 29:34.147
(organ playing softly)

29:38.985 --> 29:42.489
Uh, isn't the first row
for immediate family?

29:42.572 --> 29:45.325
Felice asked me
to seat you here.

29:48.453 --> 29:50.622
(sighs)

29:58.796 --> 30:02.091
We cannot leave soon enough.

30:23.446 --> 30:26.324
Um...

30:26.407 --> 30:29.577
when I was a little girl,

30:29.661 --> 30:33.414
my friends would all tease me
about being a daddy's girl.

30:33.498 --> 30:36.751
But I didn't mind--

30:36.834 --> 30:38.419
because I was.

30:38.503 --> 30:40.088
And I still am.

30:40.171 --> 30:43.967
My dad would always say...

30:44.050 --> 30:46.761
that when I would come
to him and...

30:46.844 --> 30:48.721
and look up at him

30:48.805 --> 30:53.768
with my big brown eyes
and bat my eyelashes at him

30:53.851 --> 30:58.982
that it was hard for him
not to smile,

30:59.065 --> 31:02.735
or to say no to anything
I might ask for at the time.

31:02.819 --> 31:04.279
(sniffles)

31:04.362 --> 31:07.782
But it was hard for me

31:07.865 --> 31:09.617
to be with him

31:09.701 --> 31:13.413
and not feel unbelievably loved,

31:13.496 --> 31:18.418
or seemingly perfect
in his eyes, no matter what.

31:19.419 --> 31:23.339
He was, and always will be,

31:23.423 --> 31:26.384
the most important man
in my life.

31:28.553 --> 31:31.472
My dad is my hero.
(sniffles)

31:31.556 --> 31:34.767
He gave his heart

31:34.851 --> 31:37.645
and his patience...

31:37.729 --> 31:41.316
to everyone
that came into his life.

31:42.358 --> 31:44.444
A life

31:44.527 --> 31:47.697
which he was
completely grateful for.

31:47.780 --> 31:49.949
(Donna sniffles)

31:53.411 --> 31:56.748
"I have been given
this incredible gift."

31:59.417 --> 32:02.337
He wrote me this letter
two years ago,

32:02.420 --> 32:06.299
while he was recovering from
a stroke that he had had.

32:07.884 --> 32:11.888
"A resurrection which I cannot
be more unworthy to receive.

32:11.971 --> 32:14.557
"A chance...

32:16.559 --> 32:21.397
"...to... to see
what truly matters in life.

32:21.481 --> 32:22.523
(Donna sniffles)

32:22.607 --> 32:26.361
"Faith which
can bring you peace.

32:26.444 --> 32:29.822
"Love which can bring you joy.

32:32.116 --> 32:34.494
"And a family...

32:39.624 --> 32:44.629
"...a family which can
bring you meaning

32:44.712 --> 32:47.423
and purpose."

32:47.507 --> 32:50.259
(Donna sobbing)

32:53.638 --> 32:55.640
DONNA (softly):
I'm sorry.

32:57.475 --> 32:59.435
"A family..."

33:01.938 --> 33:03.231
Do you want me to finish?

33:12.156 --> 33:14.409
GINA:
"And a family

33:14.492 --> 33:17.078
"which can bring you meaning
and purpose...

33:19.539 --> 33:21.791
(chuckles softly)

33:21.874 --> 33:24.669
"...and unexpected wonder.

33:24.752 --> 33:27.588
"I have been blessed
with all three,

33:27.672 --> 33:31.801
"and will do my best
to honor these blessings

33:31.884 --> 33:35.388
"every minute of every day
that God allows.

33:37.724 --> 33:40.685
All my love, Dad."

33:45.314 --> 33:47.150
(sniffles)

34:10.715 --> 34:12.632
That was beautiful.

34:14.385 --> 34:16.387
Gina.

34:19.223 --> 34:21.350
Will you sit with us?

34:47.502 --> 34:49.712
♪ ♪

34:59.889 --> 35:02.141
What you said was so beautiful.

35:03.476 --> 35:04.560
What you both said.

35:04.644 --> 35:06.312
Thanks.

35:06.395 --> 35:08.981
We were thinking of going
to the beach apartment later.

35:09.065 --> 35:11.359
If it, uh, sounds good to you.

35:11.442 --> 35:13.361
DONNA: Yeah, I'll, uh,
meet you guys there.

35:13.444 --> 35:15.738
I'm gonna take my mom home
and get her settled

35:15.822 --> 35:17.865
with her friends.

35:29.126 --> 35:31.212
Tell Donna I'll catch up
with her, okay?

35:31.295 --> 35:33.130
You sure about that?

35:33.214 --> 35:35.633
Yeah. Thanks.

35:41.264 --> 35:42.682
Hey.

35:42.765 --> 35:46.227
Hi. It was nice in there,
what happened.

35:46.310 --> 35:47.562
Yeah, it was.

35:47.645 --> 35:49.397
It's the kind of thing
that could

35:49.480 --> 35:53.359
change somebody's mind about,
uh, running away.

35:53.442 --> 35:55.403
What somebody would that be?

35:55.486 --> 35:58.406
You're in the front row now.

35:58.489 --> 36:00.575
It's where you always
wanted to be.

36:01.617 --> 36:05.121
Yeah, I wanted closure.

36:05.204 --> 36:07.081
Now I've got it.

36:11.377 --> 36:13.588
Maybe you don't.

36:13.671 --> 36:15.548
You heard the man--

36:15.631 --> 36:19.927
life's about love,
faith, family.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.762
I don't have any of those.

36:24.473 --> 36:25.892
So we'll find them together.

36:25.975 --> 36:28.394
I wish I believed that.

36:29.562 --> 36:31.439
I gotta stay.

36:33.399 --> 36:34.692
Yeah.

36:43.701 --> 36:44.785
What?

36:44.869 --> 36:46.954
It's just, uh, you've been...

36:47.038 --> 36:50.124
you've been really great this
week, and I appreciate it.

36:50.207 --> 36:52.126
Well, remember
what I said about

36:52.210 --> 36:54.086
not having to do any of those

36:54.170 --> 36:56.964
incredible, cute guy things
for a few days?

36:57.048 --> 36:58.591
No.

36:59.717 --> 37:01.344
(chuckles)

37:01.427 --> 37:02.887
Yeah, vaguely.

37:02.970 --> 37:04.931
Wasn't it, uh,
something about, uh...

37:05.014 --> 37:07.141
turning it on full blast or...?

37:07.224 --> 37:08.309
Yeah.

37:08.392 --> 37:10.436
Now would be a good time
to start.

37:18.903 --> 37:21.280
I'm sorry. I thought
you guys were back at Donna's.

37:21.364 --> 37:24.158
Yeah, we were just
going back now.

37:24.241 --> 37:26.243
We thought we'd come by
and pick up some stuff.

37:26.327 --> 37:28.162
CAMILLE:
Good thing you shopped.

37:28.245 --> 37:30.164
We raided the place.

37:30.248 --> 37:32.750
Yeah, yeah, it's a good thing.

37:35.878 --> 37:38.464
You know what? Why don't we just
hang out here?

37:38.547 --> 37:40.174
That'd be fun.

37:40.257 --> 37:41.801
We could keep you company.

37:46.764 --> 37:49.684
I passed inspection?

37:49.767 --> 37:51.686
You sure you won't come?

37:51.769 --> 37:54.563
Maybe later. Thanks.

38:07.076 --> 38:09.078
(door closes)

38:11.497 --> 38:13.416
(sighs)

38:20.089 --> 38:21.340
Hey.

38:22.967 --> 38:25.428
I was just saying good-bye
to Felice,

38:25.511 --> 38:27.888
and she told me
you were in here, so...

38:27.972 --> 38:30.558
I don't even know
where you're going.

38:30.641 --> 38:34.270
I'm just gonna drive
cross country and...

38:34.353 --> 38:36.063
figure it out on the way.

38:36.147 --> 38:38.232
Well, I think that's very brave
of you

38:38.315 --> 38:40.401
to do that on your own.

38:40.484 --> 38:43.612
It's nothing new for me
to be on my own.

38:45.531 --> 38:49.243
We used to be so fascinated
with this room, remember?

38:49.326 --> 38:52.246
Yeah, we would sneak up
to that door

38:52.329 --> 38:53.956
and we'd listen to Dad talk

38:54.040 --> 38:55.624
to his patients
on the phone, right?

38:55.708 --> 38:57.251
Yeah. When we'd get too loud,
he'd start yelling,

38:57.335 --> 38:58.878
"Felice, can't you do something
about those kids?!"

38:58.961 --> 39:01.589
(laughs)

39:01.672 --> 39:04.884
Didn't you get stuck
under this desktop once?

39:04.967 --> 39:07.428
(gasps) Yes!
Because you locked me in!

39:07.511 --> 39:09.388
Oh, yeah, that's right.

39:09.472 --> 39:11.223
Knowing your mom would
pick you up,

39:11.307 --> 39:12.725
I always wished
you could stay.

39:15.394 --> 39:17.146
I still do.

39:27.364 --> 39:29.700
Well...

39:35.247 --> 39:37.500
Well, I'll see ya. (chuckles)

39:43.172 --> 39:44.965
See ya.

39:50.012 --> 39:51.764
I'll be right back.

39:57.394 --> 40:01.440
About us being
in this really weird place...

40:01.524 --> 40:03.275
I don't want that.

40:03.359 --> 40:05.319
Neither do I.

40:05.402 --> 40:07.446
Think we can get out of it?

40:07.530 --> 40:10.282
I hope so.

40:10.366 --> 40:12.952
It's one of the reasons
I stayed.

40:34.515 --> 40:38.185
Are you...

40:38.269 --> 40:40.563
okay?

40:41.605 --> 40:43.023
No.

40:43.107 --> 40:45.401
(sighs) No.

40:47.278 --> 40:48.904
It's life, huh?

40:48.988 --> 40:53.325
Losing a family member
is never easy.

40:53.409 --> 40:55.536
I found that out
when my grandfather died.

40:55.619 --> 40:58.330
I remember.

40:58.414 --> 41:00.541
I remember that you...

41:00.624 --> 41:02.126
were there for me.

41:03.961 --> 41:08.507
I hope you know
that we are... here for you.

41:11.135 --> 41:13.387
We always will be.
