even supposed to play, but..

...but one of the regular
players in‐in Mr. Gorpley's game

02:29.616 --> 02:33.453

he took advantage of you.

don't get mad at Mr. Gorpley.

It wasn't his fault.
He‐he was trying to help me.

03:13.660 --> 03:15.729
He sat down right next to me
so he could help me

03:15.762 --> 03:17.497
by looking at my cards.

03:20.366 --> 03:23.604
Looking at your cards
is against the rules.

‐ Yes, it is.

03:31.411 --> 03:32.946
why he wouldn't let me
look at his cards.

03:34.815 --> 03:36.850
You think that's why I lost
each and every hand?

03:38.552 --> 03:40.286
Yes, yes I think so.

if I go to Mr. Gorpley

03:44.024 --> 03:46.026
and ask him real nice..

I didn't play poker all night

03:55.836 --> 03:57.370

...it seemed so real.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.776
Balki, it is real.

04:02.809 --> 04:05.512
What I mean is that Gorpley
is a serious card player.

04:06.813 --> 04:08.048
The only way
to get your money back

04:08.081 --> 04:10.350
is to beat him
at his own game.

to get my money back.

04:13.419 --> 04:16.055

was the only part of the game
I‐I didn't enjoy.

it was really a great way

I'm a beginner too.

that we pool our money

13:23.504 --> 13:24.505
Hah.

13:24.538 --> 13:26.172
‐ Fold, cousin.
‐ Balki.

13:26.206 --> 13:29.275
Fold! Spindle! Mutilate!

13:29.309 --> 13:31.144
Just don't lose
anymore of our money!

13:31.177 --> 13:32.913
I am trying to play poker.

13:35.015 --> 13:38.184
I'll see your 20..

13:38.218 --> 13:39.419
...and raise you another 20.

13:39.452 --> 13:42.188
[exhaling]
Okay.

13:43.189 --> 13:44.124
I call.
What do you got?

13:46.026 --> 13:47.193
Three jacks.
Beat 'em.

13:47.227 --> 13:48.962
Okay, three kings.

13:50.597 --> 13:53.399
Cousin, I got to talk to you
privately, excuse us!

13:53.433 --> 13:55.135
I'll be back.

13:56.236 --> 13:58.004
Cousin, remember that plan

13:58.038 --> 14:00.006
where smooth Larry Appleton
was supposed to win back

14:00.040 --> 14:01.207
my $100?

14:01.241 --> 14:03.143
Well, I can't help but notice
that‐that we are

14:03.176 --> 14:04.878
that we are down
to our last $20.

14:04.911 --> 14:08.114
Now, when does the smooth plan
kick in?

14:08.148 --> 14:10.584
Everything's working perfectly.

14:10.617 --> 14:11.652
Gorpley thinks he's winning.

14:11.685 --> 14:14.287
Well, what a coincidence,
I think he's winning too.

14:18.258 --> 14:21.528
I am in total control
of this situation.

14:21.562 --> 14:22.362
Now gimme
the rest of your money.

14:22.395 --> 14:24.330
I don't think so.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.203
I keep giving you money, and you
keep giving it to Mr. Gorpley.

14:30.236 --> 14:31.972
I could do that!

14:34.240 --> 14:36.476
Balki, your money is safe
with me, now hand it over.

14:36.510 --> 14:38.344
Cousin..

14:38.378 --> 14:41.147
...this is my last $20.

14:41.181 --> 14:43.049
It's my mad money.

14:43.083 --> 14:45.886
If you lose it,
I'm gonna be real mad.

14:48.955 --> 14:51.357
Thanks.
Trust me.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.593
Okay.

14:52.626 --> 14:54.561
I'm in.

14:57.063 --> 14:59.199
Guys, guys, guys.

14:59.232 --> 15:02.102
Why don't you just give me
your last 20 bucks and go home?

15:02.135 --> 15:03.236
You can't beat me.

15:03.269 --> 15:05.539
I've been playing poker
since I was in high school.

15:05.572 --> 15:08.008
They used to call me,
Slick Sam Gorpley.

15:10.210 --> 15:12.378
Cousin, let's get out of here,
he's got a better nickname.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.347
Balki.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.984
‐ I can take him.
‐ Okay.

15:18.018 --> 15:19.586
‐ I can do it!
‐ Okay.

15:19.620 --> 15:20.420
Why don't you go see a movie?

15:20.453 --> 15:22.388
I'd love to,
but you have all my money.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.325
Gimme another $20 in chips.

15:25.358 --> 15:26.426
[scoffing]

15:28.394 --> 15:30.531
Larry, I was afraid
I'd find you here.

15:30.564 --> 15:31.632
Jennifer.

15:31.665 --> 15:33.534
Wow, who's the blonde?

15:33.567 --> 15:35.135
Appleton's girlfriend.

15:35.168 --> 15:36.703
Why I'll never know.

15:40.006 --> 15:41.407
Larry, could I talk to you
for a minute please?

15:41.441 --> 15:44.277
Not now. It's my deal.

15:44.310 --> 15:46.146
‐ Balki, we have to talk.
‐ Yeah, okay.

15:49.249 --> 15:50.684
Balki, we have to get Larry
out of here.

15:50.717 --> 15:52.653
Well, tell me something
I don't know.

15:53.520 --> 15:54.521
How is he doing?

15:54.555 --> 15:56.089
Well, he says he's doing great

15:56.122 --> 15:58.424
but Mr. Gorpley
has all of our money.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.093
If we don't get Larry
out of here right now

16:00.126 --> 16:01.161
he'll start writing IOU's.

16:01.194 --> 16:04.164
He'll bet his car,
he'll bet everything he owns!

16:04.197 --> 16:06.399
I'll raise you $20.

16:06.432 --> 16:08.001
But, how can that be?

16:08.034 --> 16:11.337
He's supposed to be
Smooth Larry Appleton.

16:11.371 --> 16:13.740
He was Smooth Larry Appleton
years ago.

16:13.774 --> 16:15.308
But that's before
he got the fever.

16:15.341 --> 16:17.043
'It got so bad,
he finally vowed to quit'

16:17.077 --> 16:19.412
and never pick up
the cards again.

16:19.445 --> 16:21.682
I told him not to take
this chance, but, Balki

16:21.715 --> 16:24.250
he said he had to do it for you.

16:24.284 --> 16:26.019
But, but, but..

16:26.052 --> 16:27.654
...do you think
he has any control left?

16:29.455 --> 16:31.692
Alright, here's your 20.

16:31.725 --> 16:33.293
And I'll throw in the blonde.

16:38.398 --> 16:41.334
Apparently not.

16:41.367 --> 16:43.136
Come on, Jennifer, we've got
to get him out of here.

16:43.169 --> 16:44.605
‐ Cousin, come on. we're gett‐
‐ Balki.

16:44.638 --> 16:46.472
I'm not going anywhere.

16:46.507 --> 16:49.676
Larry, please, you know you've
got the fever, you can't win!

16:49.710 --> 16:51.645
Cousin, I'm sorry,
but this is for your own good.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.346
‐ Now, come on!
‐ No! No! No!

16:53.379 --> 16:55.281
No! No! No!

16:55.315 --> 16:57.317
Mr. Gorpley, tell him
that the game is over.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.485
Please, you have to let us take
him home. He's lost control.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.187
He's got $20 on the table.

17:01.221 --> 17:03.524
Yeah,
and not to mention the blonde.

17:03.557 --> 17:05.491
I'm not on the table!

17:07.227 --> 17:08.762
Oh, then I'm out.

17:11.396 --> 17:12.464
‐ And, Balki.
‐ What?

17:12.498 --> 17:13.499
‐ Put me down!
‐ No! Cou‐‐

17:13.534 --> 17:14.400
‐ Put me down!
‐ No!

17:14.434 --> 17:16.837
Put me down! Put me down!
Put me down now!

17:16.869 --> 17:19.071
Alright,
if you think it'll help.

17:19.105 --> 17:21.406
You're short, you dress funny
and you walk like a duck!

17:29.583 --> 17:31.652
Oh...oh..

17:31.685 --> 17:33.820
No, no, no.

17:33.854 --> 17:35.789
‐ Set me down.
‐ Okay.

17:39.593 --> 17:42.095
Pair of eights.

17:42.128 --> 17:44.230
Pair of jacks.
You lose again, Appleton.

17:44.264 --> 17:45.799
[laughing]

17:47.267 --> 17:49.102
Alright, Gorpley,
what do ya say?

17:49.135 --> 17:51.572
One more hand
for the whole ball of wax.

17:51.605 --> 17:54.440
No, cousin!
You can't bet my ball of wax!

17:54.474 --> 17:56.209
I've been collecting it
for years!

17:58.879 --> 18:01.114
Okay. I'll play
one more hand with you.

18:01.147 --> 18:03.316
But what are you gonna bet with?

18:03.349 --> 18:05.151
I'll bet..

18:05.185 --> 18:06.853
...next week's paycheck..

18:06.887 --> 18:09.355
...against everything
we lost tonight..

18:09.389 --> 18:11.224
...plus the hundred Balki lost.

18:11.257 --> 18:14.795
Ooh, you are
a serious card player.

18:14.828 --> 18:16.863
Cousin, cousin,
it's your paycheck!

18:22.869 --> 18:24.538
Don't worry, Balki.

18:24.571 --> 18:27.307
I'm not gonna lose.

18:27.340 --> 18:29.275
I'll take three.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.549
And I'll take...one.

18:39.219 --> 18:40.787
I'll tell you what?

18:40.821 --> 18:43.223
Let's, uh...sweeten the pot.

18:44.658 --> 18:46.459
I'll raise you..

18:46.492 --> 18:47.628
...my car.

18:49.796 --> 18:52.298
‐ No, cousin, don't do that!
‐ Balki.

18:52.332 --> 18:54.535
Cousin, you don't have
a pair of anything!

18:54.568 --> 18:57.170
Balki!

18:57.203 --> 18:59.405
Gee, I got a feeling
you're bluffing.

18:59.439 --> 19:01.542
[laughing]

19:01.575 --> 19:03.510
You wanna bet cars?

19:06.479 --> 19:08.414
I call.

19:09.315 --> 19:10.350
What you got?

19:10.383 --> 19:11.685
Full house!

19:11.718 --> 19:13.386
Kings and Aces.

19:13.419 --> 19:16.189
[laughing]

19:16.222 --> 19:17.824
Uh, you can just leave your car
here and take the bus home.

19:17.858 --> 19:19.793
It'll be a nice lesson
in humility.

19:21.227 --> 19:22.729
Oh, not so quick, slick.

19:26.967 --> 19:29.302
When I sat down you thought
you had a pigeon

19:29.335 --> 19:30.704
you could take to the cleaners.

19:30.737 --> 19:32.539
Cousin, cut through
the metaphors!

19:36.309 --> 19:38.444
I don't know what you're talking
about and I'm dying to know

19:38.478 --> 19:40.947
if we've won or lost!

19:40.981 --> 19:42.448
He thought I didn't know
how to play

19:42.482 --> 19:43.650
and that he could take
everything I had

19:43.684 --> 19:45.451
Oh.

19:45.485 --> 19:48.522
Then when you overheard Jennifer
say that I was out of control..

19:48.555 --> 19:49.422
...you thought it was Christmas.

19:49.455 --> 19:51.324
‐ Cousin‐‐
‐ He thought he could our money.

19:57.698 --> 20:01.401
Well, it was all a trap
and you walked right into it.

20:01.434 --> 20:02.969
The blonde was in on it?

20:04.437 --> 20:06.406
I have a name.

20:06.439 --> 20:07.974
You have a phone number?

20:09.275 --> 20:12.312
Walt, shut up.

20:12.345 --> 20:14.781
Balki's right, I don't have
a pair of anything.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.818
I got a straight flush.

20:19.853 --> 20:21.788
You lose, Gorpley.

20:23.957 --> 20:25.892
Oh!

20:31.965 --> 20:34.901
I can't believe I lost my car.

20:39.039 --> 20:40.607
Well..

20:40.641 --> 20:42.375
...I don't want your car.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.711
I just came to win back
what...Balki lost.

20:46.479 --> 20:48.414
Nice gesture, cousin..

20:49.750 --> 20:51.685
...but those are your car keys.

20:55.622 --> 20:58.358
[instrumental music]

21:03.463 --> 21:04.898
(Balki)
'Cousin?'

21:04.931 --> 21:06.967
You mean to tell me
that Jennifer..

21:07.000 --> 21:08.935
...knew that you were pretending
to be out of control

21:08.969 --> 21:10.403
the whole time?

21:10.436 --> 21:12.305
Yes, she did.

21:12.338 --> 21:14.407
Cousin, why you didn't tell me
what you were going to do?

21:16.009 --> 21:17.844
I was really worried,
I spent the whole evening

21:17.878 --> 21:19.813
on an emotional roller derby.

21:23.750 --> 21:26.386
I'm sorry, Balki,
but‐but I had no choice.

21:26.419 --> 21:28.088
I knew you couldn't
keep my secret.

21:28.121 --> 21:30.323
You're just not
a devious person.

21:32.826 --> 21:36.029
Well, I'm sorry,
we all have our shortcomings.

21:36.062 --> 21:38.965
No, no, Balki. That‐that's
a good thing in life.

21:38.999 --> 21:41.835
Oh, uh..

21:41.868 --> 21:44.437
Here's your $100.

21:44.470 --> 21:45.972
Thanks, cousin.

21:46.006 --> 21:48.408
Thank you,
for wining my money back.

21:48.441 --> 21:49.876
I think you would have done
the same for me.

21:49.910 --> 21:51.545
You know I would.

21:53.046 --> 21:54.915
You know, cousin,
this has been quite a week.

21:56.416 --> 21:59.352
Mr. Gorpley fooled me.

21:59.385 --> 22:01.522
You fooled me.

22:01.555 --> 22:03.489
Jennifer fooled me.

22:05.959 --> 22:08.595
I'm beginning to think..

22:08.629 --> 22:11.732
...I'm...easily fooled.

22:13.834 --> 22:16.670
You? You? No!
N‐no, Balki.

22:16.703 --> 22:19.439
You are not easily fooled.

22:19.472 --> 22:21.074
Really?

22:21.107 --> 22:22.976
Well, thank you,
that's a load off my mind.

22:24.645 --> 22:26.513
Oh...what's that?

22:27.480 --> 22:30.016
[instrumental music]

22:31.885 --> 22:33.820
What's what?

22:35.889 --> 22:37.824
What's that?

22:39.860 --> 22:41.862
What's what?

22:41.895 --> 22:42.929
What‐what's that?
