on "Dance Academy."

00:03.680 --> 00:04.960
-All right, guys.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.200
In a couple of weeks, Christian
and I are entering a

00:06.240 --> 00:08.039
crew into the biggest hip
hop comp in Sydney.

00:08.080 --> 00:10.359
Who wants to learn some
of our moves?

00:10.400 --> 00:12.439
-Hey, who taught
you that stuff?

00:12.480 --> 00:13.119
-No one.

00:13.160 --> 00:14.439
Just from clips online.

00:14.480 --> 00:16.519
-You should come down to Sydney
for the Street Beat.

00:19.559 --> 00:21.280
-What happened, Tara?

00:21.320 --> 00:23.079
Last night on tour.

00:23.120 --> 00:24.320
Did you kiss him?

00:24.359 --> 00:26.559
-No, I didn't, but
I wanted to.

00:26.600 --> 00:27.760
-Why him?

00:27.800 --> 00:29.559
-You have to let me break
up with you, Ben.

00:29.600 --> 00:33.479
-Stay away from me,
both of you.

00:33.520 --> 00:35.560
-I show you the smallest amount
of attention, and

00:35.600 --> 00:37.200
suddenly, you're in
love with me.

00:37.240 --> 00:38.399
-I didn't say that.

00:38.439 --> 00:41.399
-As usual, you expect me
to just be that person.

01:30.680 --> 01:32.120
CHRISTIAN NARRATING: I really
got into dancing

01:32.159 --> 01:33.640
when my mom was sick.

01:33.680 --> 01:37.159
It was the only way I knew how
to drown out the guilt that I

01:37.200 --> 01:41.680
couldn't save her, to silence
the voices in my head.

01:41.719 --> 01:42.599
MAN (OFFSCREEN): You think
they'll ever let

01:42.640 --> 01:43.480
you be one of them?

01:43.519 --> 01:45.200
A ballet boy?

01:45.239 --> 01:46.640
You can't change, mate.

01:46.680 --> 01:48.079
MAN (OFFSCREEN): It's clear you
don't want to be here, so

01:48.120 --> 01:50.359
why don't you just crawl back to
whatever rat hole you came

01:50.400 --> 01:51.640
out of, and everyone's happy.

01:51.680 --> 01:53.000
MAN (OFFSCREEN): I work so
much harder than you.

01:53.040 --> 01:55.120
You only show up for exams, and
they still let you pass.

01:55.159 --> 01:57.799
CHRISTIAN NARRATING: The voices
in my head, the ones

01:57.840 --> 02:01.200
telling me I'm letting
them down.

02:01.239 --> 02:03.120
MAN (OFFSCREEN): You don't
respect yourself, you don't

02:03.159 --> 02:05.439
respect your talent, and you
hate people who do because

02:05.480 --> 02:09.199
deep down, I don't know, maybe
you hate yourself.

02:09.240 --> 02:12.680
CHRISTIAN NARRATING: All those
expectations, this year, all

02:12.719 --> 02:15.599
I've been doing is trying to
keep my head above water.

02:15.639 --> 02:17.000
BEN (OFFSCREEN): Stay
away from me.

02:17.039 --> 02:18.360
CHRISTIAN NARRATING: I know
I've got no right to self

02:18.400 --> 02:20.719
pity, but too much
has happened.

02:20.759 --> 02:23.800
It can't be a coincidence that
I infect everything.

02:23.840 --> 02:25.120
GIRL (OFFSCREEN): You think
you're honoring Sammy?

02:25.159 --> 02:27.479
You're exploiting his memory
as an excuse to drift.

02:27.520 --> 02:29.599
Christian, what is wrong with
you, because for once, I don't

02:29.639 --> 02:31.800
think this is me creating
it all in my head.

02:31.840 --> 02:34.199
CHRISTIAN NARRATING:
The voices,

02:34.240 --> 02:36.439
they're dragging me under.

02:36.479 --> 02:38.039
MAN (OFFSCREEN): You OK?

02:38.080 --> 02:40.159
-Why wouldn't I be?

02:40.199 --> 02:41.199
-All right, last rehearsal.

02:41.240 --> 02:42.599

02:53.599 --> 02:54.800
-And lips.

02:59.840 --> 03:03.159
-Excuse me.

03:03.199 --> 03:04.400
Ignore me.

03:07.560 --> 03:09.319
-Zero impact again.

03:09.360 --> 03:10.199
-Patience, petal.

03:10.240 --> 03:12.479
We're wearing her down.

03:12.520 --> 03:13.719
-She couldn't care less.

03:20.159 --> 03:21.479
-Yeah, I do hip hop.

03:21.520 --> 03:23.199
I'm so cool.

03:23.240 --> 03:25.520
Ollie knew I wanted in
on Street Beats.

03:25.560 --> 03:27.400
I should be headlining
that crew.

03:27.439 --> 03:29.639
-Why do you suddenly
look constipated?

03:29.680 --> 03:31.039
-This is me plotting.

03:36.439 --> 03:38.479
-The only way to ensure unity
and the best possible

03:38.520 --> 03:40.319
production is if we
allocate roles

03:40.360 --> 03:42.159
according to class results.

03:42.199 --> 03:43.800
-I'm here.

03:43.840 --> 03:45.240
-I see that.

03:45.280 --> 03:46.599
Um, sorry.

03:46.639 --> 03:47.840
They just announced end of year
production so I might be

03:47.879 --> 03:49.800
in audition lock down for
the next day or so.

03:49.840 --> 03:53.520
-As I'm currently ranked first,
obviously, I'll be

03:53.560 --> 03:54.840
auditioning for Swanhilde.

03:54.879 --> 03:57.599
-They're doing it again, but
if Ben's happy, then I'm

03:57.639 --> 03:59.800
relieved, and I can't donate any
more blood for like three

03:59.840 --> 04:01.719
weeks, so--

04:01.759 --> 04:05.319
-Um Tara, best friend,
this is Jamie, um--

04:05.360 --> 04:06.280
-She likes to keep me
in a dark hole,

Tara, no natural light.

kind of funny.

across the street.

04:14.520 --> 04:15.560
It's a long story.

04:15.599 --> 04:17.199
-So what's the production
called?

04:17.240 --> 04:17.800
-Um

04:17.839 --> 04:19.160
"Coppelia." -Yay!

04:19.199 --> 04:21.319
I love "Coppelia." What-- what
do you want to go for?

04:21.360 --> 04:23.439
-The lead, I'm assuming.

04:23.480 --> 04:24.800
-Attention, Kat?

04:24.839 --> 04:29.399
You're down here, so I'd advise
Doll Four or Doll Five.

04:29.439 --> 04:32.639
It's your choice.

Hey, mate.

04:42.839 --> 04:44.279
How did you get here?

04:44.319 --> 04:46.199
-Bus.

04:46.240 --> 04:47.639
-By yourself?

04:47.680 --> 04:51.519
-Told Gran I had to come to
Street Beats, like you said.

04:51.560 --> 04:56.199
-All right, well, you'd better
meat the rest of Infected.

04:56.240 --> 05:00.519
It's named after Ollie's
pus-filled toe.

05:00.560 --> 05:03.439
Boys, this is Jayden, the
prodigy from the sticks.

05:03.480 --> 05:04.639
-What's up, man?

05:08.399 --> 05:09.800
-This is child care?

05:09.839 --> 05:11.680
-I sort of invited him.

05:11.720 --> 05:13.240
He could be an asset.

05:13.279 --> 05:15.560
-No, winning Street
Beats is an asset.

05:18.680 --> 05:19.839
You have to send him home.

I get this stupid
thing working.

-Trust me, it's dangerous
to make one person your

05:37.680 --> 05:38.959
everything.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.480
It's much healthier to join
our Street Beats crew.

05:42.519 --> 05:45.639
-Yeah, because, you know three
hip hop moves and Christian

05:45.680 --> 05:46.800
taught you all of them.

and Sammy always were so--
