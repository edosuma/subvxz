Like, I'm battling myself

38:07.885 --> 38:10.454
more than I'm battling
anything else.

38:10.521 --> 38:11.822
- This is an eye opener for me.

38:11.889 --> 38:14.258
I tried to salvage it
when it got too dark.

38:14.325 --> 38:15.860
I still had smooth shading.

38:15.926 --> 38:18.329
I did everything that I could
to stay in the race.

38:18.396 --> 38:20.297
- The fact that the legibility
on this thing

38:20.364 --> 38:22.833
is so hard to see the ship
from any distance,

38:22.900 --> 38:23.868
you just darked this thing out.

38:23.934 --> 38:25.302
And looking at Jaz's tattoo,

38:25.369 --> 38:27.405
that black fade to orange,
not smooth.

38:27.471 --> 38:29.440
The red stripes,
a lot of holidays.

38:29.507 --> 38:30.508
- It's just a moving target.

38:30.574 --> 38:33.044
That's just what I--
what I had, you know?

38:33.110 --> 38:35.012
- It's the color for me
that is a big question mark.

38:35.079 --> 38:37.248
If I'm coloring,
I'm sticking and stirring,

38:37.314 --> 38:38.249
so I don't care
what they're doing.

38:38.315 --> 38:39.350
They can pop out of the chair.

38:39.417 --> 38:40.584
I'm in, and I'm buried.

38:40.651 --> 38:42.520
I just make my circles and go.

38:42.586 --> 38:45.089
- After those first lines,
it was just difficult.

38:45.156 --> 38:47.191
- That girl's kind of
laying flat, right?

38:47.258 --> 38:48.192
- Yeah.

38:48.259 --> 38:49.193
- Why is her back arm,

38:49.260 --> 38:50.561
the one that should
be further away,

38:50.628 --> 38:52.196
longer than her front arm?

38:52.263 --> 38:54.398
- Not necessarily realistic.
- So what's realism about it?

38:54.465 --> 38:55.399
That's what I'm asking.

38:55.466 --> 38:56.767
- Overall, I think
it's legible.
