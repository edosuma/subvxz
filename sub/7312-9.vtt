00:03.434 --> 00:04.434
Hello, Ziva.

00:04.478 --> 00:05.869
Oh, good.
The Israelis are back.

00:05.913 --> 00:08.000
I'm gonna be tied up at
this review conference all week.

00:08.043 --> 00:09.956
Amsterdam on
today's docket?

00:10.000 --> 00:11.652
ELI DAVID:
You must be courageous

00:11.695 --> 00:12.739
and learn the truth.

00:14.217 --> 00:15.565
Get him to the safe house!

00:15.608 --> 00:17.086
Get in!
Get in! Let's go!

00:21.217 --> 00:22.434
Sounds like
World War III.

00:22.478 --> 00:23.782
They should be back
at the safe house by now.

00:23.826 --> 00:25.000
Hadar, acknowledge.

00:25.043 --> 00:26.434
Leon, are you there?

00:26.478 --> 00:27.869
Anyone?

00:27.913 --> 00:31.043
What's happened?

00:31.086 --> 00:34.260
GIBBS:
Hadar... acknowledge.

00:34.304 --> 00:35.608
[coughing]

00:35.652 --> 00:37.478
Leon, are you there?

00:37.521 --> 00:40.043
[groans]

00:40.086 --> 00:41.826
Eli?

00:41.869 --> 00:44.739
[coughing, groaning]

01:02.956 --> 01:04.826
I can't believe that happened.

01:14.304 --> 01:17.130
[groans]

01:21.913 --> 01:25.739
[man laughing]

01:25.782 --> 01:27.043
You're crazy.

01:27.086 --> 01:29.043
[laughing, grunts]

01:29.086 --> 01:29.826
[laughing]

01:33.086 --> 01:37.000
[footsteps approaching]

01:45.782 --> 01:47.826
Leon.

01:50.347 --> 01:52.304
Leon!

01:52.347 --> 01:53.652
[groans]

01:53.695 --> 01:55.043
You're crazy.

01:55.086 --> 01:56.782
[groans]

01:56.826 --> 01:58.000
Hey, come on.
[groans]

01:58.043 --> 01:59.521
Come on, look at me.
Look at me!

02:01.086 --> 02:03.521
I can't believe
that happened again.

02:03.565 --> 02:05.173
[groaning]

02:07.130 --> 02:09.130
[groaning]

02:09.173 --> 02:11.434
Come on, Leon,
stay with me.

02:43.478 --> 02:44.826
WOMAN: Possible
perforated organs,

02:44.869 --> 02:46.521
lacerated spleen,
and he's losing blood fast.

02:46.565 --> 02:47.565
My wife...

02:47.608 --> 02:48.826
BP's at 90/40, Doctor.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.739
Pulse ox 80% and falling
on eight liters O2.

02:50.782 --> 02:53.000
My wife...

02:53.043 --> 02:54.391
Single. I got a girlfriend.

02:54.434 --> 02:56.434
I got a girlfriend.

02:56.478 --> 02:57.913

Hey!

03:11.347 --> 03:12.565
Hey!

03:14.086 --> 03:15.695
Wow. I never had
to work so hard

03:15.739 --> 03:16.913
to get someone's attention.

03:16.956 --> 03:18.869
Special Agent Whitney Sharp.

03:18.913 --> 03:20.826
Naval Investigative Service.

03:20.869 --> 03:24.434
Hey, mouth closed, kiddo,
or the bugs will get in.

03:24.478 --> 03:25.739
You got a minute to talk?

03:25.782 --> 03:27.434
No, I'm late
for class.
No, you're not.

03:27.478 --> 03:29.434
You just finished your
Combat Philosophy seminar,

03:29.478 --> 03:31.217
and you have about
a two-hour window

03:31.260 --> 03:33.000
until Advanced
Cryptography.

03:33.043 --> 03:35.043
Which I plan to spend
in the computer lab.

03:35.086 --> 03:36.391
Well, make another
plan, Leon.

03:36.434 --> 03:37.826
Look, lady...
Whitney.

03:37.869 --> 03:39.000
All right,
look, Whitney...

03:39.043 --> 03:40.478
Or Special Agent Sharp.

03:40.521 --> 03:42.260
Look, Special Agent Sharp,
you can follow me around,

03:42.304 --> 03:43.739
you can bat
your eyes at me,

03:43.782 --> 03:45.652
you can chuck me
on the chin, if you like.

03:45.695 --> 03:47.043
I don't know who taught you
that's how you get a man.

03:47.086 --> 03:49.478
It's not gonna get you me.

03:49.521 --> 03:51.826
You know, when a suspect
prefaces what he's about to say

03:51.869 --> 03:54.043
with "look,"
or "here" or "so,"

03:54.086 --> 03:56.826
it usually means
he feels boxed into a corner.

03:56.869 --> 03:59.173
And I don't want you
to feel that way,

03:59.217 --> 04:01.000
especially if we might
be working together.

04:02.913 --> 04:04.913
You want me to
be a Navy cop?

04:04.956 --> 04:06.565
NIS has been watching you.

04:06.608 --> 04:09.217
And we feel like
you might be a perfect fit

04:09.260 --> 04:10.608
to an operation we're planning.

04:10.652 --> 04:12.347
That is, of course,
if you're done

04:12.391 --> 04:14.260
with the whole
no friends,

04:14.304 --> 04:17.000
no connections,
single, lone-wolf thing.

04:17.043 --> 04:20.739
We do know everything about you.

04:20.782 --> 04:22.434
Single? I got a girlfriend.

04:22.478 --> 04:24.260
VANCE:
My wife...

04:24.304 --> 04:25.434
Stop!

04:27.217 --> 04:29.434
Gibbs, call my wife.

04:29.478 --> 04:31.565
I want full protective detail
for my family.

04:31.608 --> 04:33.565
Done. Can you remember
anything, Leon?

04:33.608 --> 04:35.478
Where did Eli David go?

04:35.521 --> 04:37.217
WOMAN: BP's 70/30,
sat's 70, Doctor.

04:37.260 --> 04:38.695
That's it.
Conversation's over.

04:38.739 --> 04:40.130
You're in charge, Gibbs.

04:40.173 --> 04:41.695
I'm not you, Leon.

04:41.739 --> 04:42.782
I trust you, Gibbs.

04:44.043 --> 04:46.000
[sighs]

04:46.043 --> 04:47.521
Boss, I don't
understand it.

04:47.565 --> 04:49.130
Every other member

04:49.173 --> 04:51.173
of the Palestinian
Liberation Front is dead.

04:51.217 --> 04:53.391
Karif Yasin is the only one
still alive,

04:53.434 --> 04:55.043
and he's in custody.

04:57.608 --> 04:59.521
Call Tony, Call Ziva.

04:59.565 --> 05:02.130
Lock down the crime
scene, process and canvass.

05:02.173 --> 05:03.869
Shut down Vance's
conference.

05:03.913 --> 05:05.652
Transfer everyone
back to the Navy Yard.

05:05.695 --> 05:07.000
Got it.
Anything else?

05:07.043 --> 05:08.956
Yasin-- get him back
in Interrogation.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.130
Find out what the
hell we missed.

05:17.478 --> 05:20.043
MALACHI: Hadar must have had
no warning.

05:20.086 --> 05:22.391
Someone is going
to pay for this, Amit.

05:22.434 --> 05:23.913
Officers.

05:30.826 --> 05:32.434
Possible shotgun blasts.

05:32.478 --> 05:35.478
Multiple sources indicate
multiple shooters.

05:35.521 --> 05:39.173
You know, our safe house
in Tel Aviv is a concrete bunker

05:39.217 --> 05:40.608
100 feet
below ground.

05:40.652 --> 05:42.304
Meaning this would not
have happened there?

05:42.347 --> 05:44.260
Because there is never
any violence in Israel.

05:44.304 --> 05:45.478
Ladies...

05:45.521 --> 05:47.478
Hadar is dead.

05:47.521 --> 05:49.608
We were operating
under NCIS protocol.

05:49.652 --> 05:50.782
Are you blaming me?

05:50.826 --> 05:53.347
Liat, focus!

05:53.391 --> 05:54.782
Three men walk
into a room.

05:54.826 --> 05:56.869
One ends up in the morgue,
one in the hospital.

05:56.913 --> 05:58.478
Only leaves one
we can do anything about.

06:01.608 --> 06:03.304
The blood trail leads
to the back room.

06:07.521 --> 06:09.652
First priority-- type
and match to confirm....

06:09.695 --> 06:11.782
it belongs to Eli David.

06:11.826 --> 06:14.956
And it has to be his
or his kidnapper.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.869
Why do you assume
he was kidnapped?

06:17.913 --> 06:19.956
Because it is the only option

06:20.000 --> 06:22.304
where my father is still alive.

06:33.478 --> 06:35.391
Retractor.

06:35.434 --> 06:37.173
Suction.

06:37.217 --> 06:39.130
Thank you.

06:39.173 --> 06:40.391
Forceps.

06:44.826 --> 06:45.826
There are fragments
everywhere.

06:51.478 --> 06:53.130
Anything I touch
starts bleeding.

06:53.173 --> 06:55.217
We're going to need
to clamp that off.

06:56.434 --> 07:02.521
[coins clinking]

07:19.434 --> 07:21.782
Don't stand there
and admire your work.

07:21.826 --> 07:23.739
We've been doing
this for six weeks.

07:23.782 --> 07:26.347
You're supposed to be able
to execute a basic dead-drop.

07:26.391 --> 07:29.000
When are you gonna tell me
what my op is?

07:29.043 --> 07:30.391
When we're alone.

07:30.434 --> 07:31.913
Don't look.

07:33.565 --> 07:35.391
I'll tell you
when I think you're ready.

07:35.434 --> 07:37.521
When you're done
molding me out of clay.

07:37.565 --> 07:39.043
[laughs]

07:39.086 --> 07:40.521
If you were
malleable and soft,

07:40.565 --> 07:42.130
I never would
have accepted you.

07:42.173 --> 07:43.739
I work in marble

07:43.782 --> 07:45.782
like Michelangelo.

07:45.826 --> 07:47.000
You ever been to Italy?

07:47.043 --> 07:48.260
No, I've never
been out of the U.S.

07:48.304 --> 07:49.565
I don't even
have a passport.

07:49.608 --> 07:51.000
Right hand.

07:53.739 --> 07:54.826
Oh. Excuse me.

08:00.347 --> 08:01.652
You leave tomorrow.

08:01.695 --> 08:03.000
I'm going to Europe?

08:04.695 --> 08:06.565
Amsterdam.

08:11.521 --> 08:14.173
McGEE:
Everybody, remember,

08:14.217 --> 08:15.565
there is water
in the conference room.

08:15.608 --> 08:19.478
I've rewired the plasma
so it has satellite TV.

08:19.521 --> 08:21.391
Thank you.

08:21.434 --> 08:23.739
It's like herding cats,
huh, Agent McGee?

08:23.782 --> 08:25.956
McGEE: I don't like it
at all, Agent Sharp.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.304
I've got a dozen
other retired agents.

08:27.347 --> 08:30.000
I have Branch, I've got Morrow,
I've got Nedrow.

08:30.043 --> 08:32.652
I have more directors than
the front row of the Oscars.

08:32.695 --> 08:34.826
So any help that you
can give me, please.

08:34.869 --> 08:36.782
You're missing one.

08:39.260 --> 08:41.130
GIBBS:
McGee, witness statements.

08:41.173 --> 08:43.217
Yeah.

08:43.260 --> 08:46.173
Uh, people heard the blasts,
but no one saw anything.

08:46.217 --> 08:48.130
Tony and Ziva are
following a blood trail.

08:48.173 --> 08:50.130
The thinking is,
Eli was abducted.

08:50.173 --> 08:51.956
Making Vance and Hadar
collateral damage.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.434
Karif Yasin?

08:53.478 --> 08:55.173
Well, last of the Mohicans
is en route,

08:55.217 --> 08:57.043
but the timing
doesn't compute.

08:57.086 --> 08:58.217
We were on 'em, boss.

08:58.260 --> 08:59.434
They didn't make
that safe house.

08:59.478 --> 09:00.652
It had to be someone else.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.391
Oh, no.

09:06.434 --> 09:07.652
Agent McCallister...

09:07.695 --> 09:09.217
Now, remember,
you're supposed

09:09.260 --> 09:10.478
to ask me before using
the men's room.

09:10.521 --> 09:12.826
Shut up!

09:12.869 --> 09:15.000
Permission to smack your boy
with my cane, Gibbs.

09:16.173 --> 09:19.043
Denied.

09:19.086 --> 09:20.913
I guess secret
goes out the window

09:20.956 --> 09:22.347
when it's evidence in a murder.

09:22.391 --> 09:24.347
Or a kidnapping.

09:24.391 --> 09:25.956
Eli David is missing.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.043
Missing doesn't necessarily
mean kidnapped.

09:29.086 --> 09:33.608
Attacking an NCIS safe house
requires inside information.

09:33.652 --> 09:36.347
And given this little
conference was destined

09:36.391 --> 09:38.826
to become a shouting match
between and Vance and Eli.

09:38.869 --> 09:41.521
He could be a victim.

09:41.565 --> 09:44.913
What I know of the man,
makes more sense...

09:44.956 --> 09:46.652
If Eli David was the suspect,

09:46.695 --> 09:49.086
even with his own
bodyguard dead.

09:49.130 --> 09:50.739
You mean his only witness.

09:50.782 --> 09:53.043
I'm just spitballing.

09:53.086 --> 09:54.608
Heck, it wouldn't
be the first time

09:54.652 --> 09:56.434
Eli tried to kill Vance.

10:01.826 --> 10:02.739
I'd start here.

10:04.782 --> 10:06.260
Operation Trident.

10:22.043 --> 10:24.347
God bless it.
Look at this.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.521
Hey!

10:26.565 --> 10:28.521
American!

10:28.565 --> 10:29.652
It's okay.

10:29.695 --> 10:31.304
Yeah, come on over.

10:36.086 --> 10:37.217
I'm McCallister.

10:37.260 --> 10:38.347
Oh.

10:38.391 --> 10:41.652
You can cut out
the Agent 13 bit.

10:41.695 --> 10:43.217
I don't know
what that means.

10:43.260 --> 10:44.956
Get Smart?

10:45.000 --> 10:46.565
Kontrol's master
of camouflage?

10:46.608 --> 10:49.173
Forget it.

10:49.217 --> 10:50.347
Listen, you're supposed

10:50.391 --> 10:52.130
to stick out, not blend in.

10:52.173 --> 10:53.782
Put on the uniform.

10:53.826 --> 10:56.043
Make it easy for
this guy to find you.

10:56.086 --> 10:58.086
We're still working
on a last name.

10:58.130 --> 10:59.826
We just call him
The Russian.

10:59.869 --> 11:01.521
The Soviet Union
is crumbling.

11:01.565 --> 11:04.521
What's Russian intelligence
services doing in Holland?

11:04.565 --> 11:06.086
You tell me.

11:06.130 --> 11:07.956
Port of Amsterdam's
a major docking point

11:08.000 --> 11:10.173
for most ships
throughout Europe,

11:10.217 --> 11:12.260
down to South Africa
and the Middle East.

11:12.304 --> 11:15.217
He bribes sailors to
gain foreign intel.

11:15.260 --> 11:17.347
Oh, Junior Varsity made a play.

11:17.391 --> 11:19.000
[laughs]

11:19.043 --> 11:20.956
I've been studying
the Middle East.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.739
I figure we're gonna be heavily
involved down there for a while.

11:23.782 --> 11:25.086
Nah. Yesterday's news.

11:25.130 --> 11:26.304
Playing field's
changing a bit,

11:26.347 --> 11:28.478
but Hussein and Iraq
are down for the count.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.347
If anybody's gonna
get up off the mat,

11:30.391 --> 11:31.826
it's the Iron Curtain.

11:31.869 --> 11:35.086
The Reds just want us to
think the Cold War is over.

11:35.130 --> 11:37.304
That's your Russian.

11:37.347 --> 11:38.913
I'll find him.

11:38.956 --> 11:41.739
Look, how hard
is this to get?

11:41.782 --> 11:43.739
Just be yourself.

11:43.782 --> 11:45.000
Stop and smell the tulips.

11:45.043 --> 11:46.608
Visit the Heineken Brewery.

11:46.652 --> 11:48.434
Go see Anne Frank's house.

11:48.478 --> 11:49.739
Not in that order.
[laughing]

11:49.782 --> 11:51.173
The Russian'll find you.

11:51.217 --> 11:53.782
All right, how do I get
in touch with you?[laughs]

11:53.826 --> 11:56.434
I'll be watching.

12:15.434 --> 12:19.391
LIAT: Look at the distance
between the blood drops.

12:19.434 --> 12:20.695
He was walking.

12:20.739 --> 12:22.565
Torn fabric.

12:22.608 --> 12:25.260
Heather gray.
Eli's suit.

12:25.304 --> 12:27.130
He made a tourniquet
to take care of his wounds.

12:27.173 --> 12:28.826
He was not abducted.

12:28.869 --> 12:30.260
No. He fled the scene.

12:30.304 --> 12:32.173
No. He eluded his attackers.

12:32.217 --> 12:33.782
He left us a trail to follow.

12:33.826 --> 12:36.043
[phone ringing]Maybe he left us more.

12:36.086 --> 12:37.217
DiNozzo.

12:37.260 --> 12:38.608
Yeah, boss.

12:38.652 --> 12:40.739
Uh, well, we've
got a theory here.

12:40.782 --> 12:42.000
Uh, Eli's on
the lam.

12:42.043 --> 12:43.434
Looks like he...

12:43.478 --> 12:45.956
Well, I'm sure McGee
has his hands full.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.521
He has little
tiny hands...

12:49.391 --> 12:50.782
Blood trail led
us to an alley

12:50.826 --> 12:52.347
right around the corner
from the safe house.

12:58.782 --> 12:59.478
Here is something.

12:59.521 --> 13:01.478
Will do. Okay.

13:05.260 --> 13:07.869
LIAT: Director David has
left us a message.

13:07.913 --> 13:09.217
TONY:
What's that?

13:09.260 --> 13:10.739
It's the Hebrew word beyt.

13:10.782 --> 13:12.173
It means house or home.

13:12.217 --> 13:15.260
Oh, so, he's walking
all the way home to Israel?

13:15.304 --> 13:17.260
More likely,
the Israeli Embassy.

13:17.304 --> 13:20.000
TONY: House. Well, you know,
there is a House of Pancakes

13:20.043 --> 13:21.739
down the street,
and also a House of Pies.

13:21.782 --> 13:23.173
And Donut House.

13:23.217 --> 13:24.826
ZIVA: My father needs
medical attention.

13:24.869 --> 13:26.347
We should split up,
cover each possibility.

13:26.391 --> 13:28.565
Okay.

13:28.608 --> 13:30.565
TONY:
Listen, you're gonna have

13:30.608 --> 13:32.173
to go on your own,
'cause Gibbs wants me to...

13:32.217 --> 13:33.652
Tony, do you know
what a golem is?

13:33.695 --> 13:36.000
Creepy schizophrenic creature
from Lord of the Rings.

13:36.043 --> 13:37.521
No, that's Gollum.

13:37.565 --> 13:40.260
A golem is a supernatural
being from Jewish folklore.

13:40.304 --> 13:41.826
He was created from mud
to protect the Jews.

13:41.869 --> 13:45.130
The mystics etched the
word emetinto his forehead.

13:45.173 --> 13:47.434
When the monster's
task was completed,

13:47.478 --> 13:50.869
the letter alephwas scratched
out, changing the word to met.

13:50.913 --> 13:52.347
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

13:52.391 --> 13:54.130
Yeah.
Liat pulled a golem.

13:54.173 --> 13:55.565
She erased a letter?

13:55.608 --> 13:57.521
Liat is an overachiever.

13:57.565 --> 13:59.086
She erased

13:59.130 --> 14:00.608
the entire word.

14:03.434 --> 14:06.217
You're not going to
the House of Pancakes, are you?

14:06.260 --> 14:09.913
GIBBS: The rest of your
group is dead, Yasin.

14:09.956 --> 14:12.913
Who's got Eli David?

14:12.956 --> 14:17.434
Abasi El Masri is a martyr.

14:17.478 --> 14:19.695
Ah. Okay, you want
to take credit for that, too,

14:19.739 --> 14:21.000
because you're just
gonna rot away.

14:21.043 --> 14:23.826
Justice has been served!

14:23.869 --> 14:26.173
A Mossad officer is dead.

14:26.217 --> 14:29.956
My boss-- he might not
live through the day.

14:31.782 --> 14:33.434
You like that?

14:33.478 --> 14:34.695
[laughs]

14:34.739 --> 14:36.695
Would you like
me to tell you

14:36.739 --> 14:38.869
how it happened?

14:38.913 --> 14:40.304
Whereit happened?

14:46.869 --> 14:49.000
'Cause you had
nothing to do with it.

15:08.173 --> 15:09.826
Hello, Dr. Mallard.

15:09.869 --> 15:11.695
Mrs. Sharp.

15:13.652 --> 15:16.086
I was sorry to hear
about your mother.

15:16.130 --> 15:18.652
Though she hated me,

15:18.695 --> 15:20.217
I know that you cared
for her deeply.

15:20.260 --> 15:22.826
I appreciate your condolences.

15:22.869 --> 15:25.043
And you have mine...

15:25.086 --> 15:27.000
regarding your husband.

15:27.043 --> 15:28.000
[laughs]

15:28.043 --> 15:29.695
He detested you.

15:29.739 --> 15:31.434
And I him.

15:31.478 --> 15:34.695
But I'm not the kind of man
to spit on another's grave.

15:34.739 --> 15:37.391
Oh, I think I know

15:37.434 --> 15:40.000
exactly the kind
of man you are.

15:40.043 --> 15:42.130
Yeah, one...

15:42.173 --> 15:44.478
moment of weakness

15:44.521 --> 15:47.173
does not define one's character.

15:47.217 --> 15:49.173
Doesn't it?

15:52.391 --> 15:54.130
[sighs]
Agent Gibbs.

15:54.173 --> 15:56.260
Any chance of removing
that protective detail?

15:56.304 --> 15:57.869
It's feeling a little
crowded in the building.

15:59.173 --> 16:00.478
See what I can do.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.086
Always a pleasure,
Doctor.

16:07.434 --> 16:09.043
Ah. Could have hung
a sock on the door.

16:09.086 --> 16:10.782
There's no knob.

16:10.826 --> 16:12.043
Cause of death?

16:12.086 --> 16:14.608
Catastrophic damage
to the heart in addition

16:14.652 --> 16:16.913
to massive blood loss
and organ trauma.

16:16.956 --> 16:18.478
The entry wounds

16:18.521 --> 16:20.217
are all to the back
and sides.

16:20.260 --> 16:22.782
Strange mix
for a 12-gauge.

16:22.826 --> 16:24.782
These don't match
any shotgun I've seen.

16:24.826 --> 16:28.869
But I can confirm
that the blast had

16:28.913 --> 16:29.869
an upward trajectory.

16:29.913 --> 16:32.000
You know, Jethro,

16:32.043 --> 16:33.869
the dispersal pattern

16:33.913 --> 16:35.304
and the volume--

16:35.347 --> 16:37.739
they more closely resemble

16:37.782 --> 16:39.869
an improvised explosive device.

16:39.913 --> 16:44.521
Would explain the handful
of nails and plastic.

16:44.565 --> 16:46.217
Haven't had time to finish

16:46.260 --> 16:48.173
processing the scene.

16:48.217 --> 16:50.478
Tracking "Eli the Elusive"
became top priority.

16:50.521 --> 16:54.000
Well, Hadar died defending him.

17:11.347 --> 17:14.695
Fancy a smoke?

17:16.304 --> 17:18.000
I like to sprinkle
a little hashish

17:18.043 --> 17:20.000
into my marijuana.

17:20.043 --> 17:23.956
It's too strong for the locals,
but not for an American.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.652
I don't know who you are, man,

17:25.695 --> 17:27.260
but if you're buying,
I'll take an espresso.

17:27.304 --> 17:29.260
Please.

17:29.304 --> 17:30.956
[click]

17:31.000 --> 17:33.130
[orders coffee in Dutch]

17:33.173 --> 17:34.391
WAITER: Yes. Coming up.I don't know how

17:34.434 --> 17:36.565
you drink that stuff.
It repulses me.

17:36.608 --> 17:38.521
So, what wakes an Israeli up
in the morning?

17:38.565 --> 17:39.739
[chuckles]

17:39.782 --> 17:41.347
My wife.

17:41.391 --> 17:43.956
Although not for
several months.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.478
I'm Eli.

17:46.521 --> 17:47.739
Leon.

17:47.782 --> 17:49.000
Leon.

17:49.043 --> 17:51.608
Like yin and yang.

17:51.652 --> 17:53.521
WAITER:
There you are.Thank you.

17:57.652 --> 17:59.782
Leon...

17:59.826 --> 18:02.478
you would not turn down
a piece of free advice

18:02.521 --> 18:04.739
about this town, because
you are new here, hmm?

18:04.782 --> 18:08.000
Well, I'm only gonna be
docked here for a few days.

18:08.043 --> 18:09.956
Hmm.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.652
Why would a sailor on leave want
to keep his mind sharp?

18:15.304 --> 18:17.869
Leon,

18:17.913 --> 18:21.260
the Russian will realize that
you are not what he wants.

18:21.304 --> 18:23.565
Then his men will kill you.

18:26.173 --> 18:27.478
Go back to the boat...

18:30.391 --> 18:32.260
...or you are a dead man.

18:37.608 --> 18:39.695
ABBY: The director's lucky
to be alive, McGee.

18:39.739 --> 18:41.173
There were three
separate blasts,

18:41.217 --> 18:43.695
but the diffusion is
rectangular, instead of round.

18:43.739 --> 18:45.260
I also have found

18:45.304 --> 18:47.913
traces of sulfur, charcoal,

18:47.956 --> 18:49.565
ammonium nitrate and potassium

18:49.608 --> 18:51.173
hydroxide, so,

18:51.217 --> 18:53.434
the murder weapon was a series

18:53.478 --> 18:55.391
of claymore-type
directional mines.

18:55.434 --> 18:57.782
Safe house was booby-trapped.

18:57.826 --> 18:59.173
Yeah. It was wired

18:59.217 --> 19:00.826
from the inside, so
the opening and closing

19:00.869 --> 19:02.478
of the door pulled the pin.

19:02.521 --> 19:04.826
Duty roster on the safe house
shows that it was only vacant

19:04.869 --> 19:07.304
and locked down for a
half-hour this morning,

19:07.347 --> 19:08.608
prior to the conference.

19:08.652 --> 19:09.913
But it wouldn't take very long

19:09.956 --> 19:11.695
to rig if they had built
in advance.

19:11.739 --> 19:13.608
I mean, it's really not hard
to improvise, either.

19:13.652 --> 19:16.608
The only challenging ingredient
to find is a blasting cap.

19:16.652 --> 19:18.000
Well, cross-reference
hardware stores

19:18.043 --> 19:20.521
[fax beeps]with chemistry supply shops

19:20.565 --> 19:22.913
and maybe we can get a lead
on who built the things.

19:22.956 --> 19:23.956
Okay, Abby, I'm
gonna need... Oh.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.130
A shopping list?

19:25.173 --> 19:27.434
Thanks.

19:27.478 --> 19:30.173
G-100 grade ball bearings,

19:30.217 --> 19:33.043
12 penny nails,
plastic casing,

19:33.086 --> 19:35.130
copper wire,
electrical tape.

19:35.173 --> 19:38.217
And a little bit
of ingenuity,

19:38.260 --> 19:41.217
you, too, could
build one of these.

19:41.260 --> 19:42.869
A claymore mine.

19:42.913 --> 19:43.956
Mc... Gyver?

19:44.000 --> 19:46.826
Mc... Gyver?

19:46.869 --> 19:49.347
Been keeping that one
in my back pocket for a while.

20:04.217 --> 20:08.000
They called him
Maagen David.

20:08.043 --> 20:09.043
The Star of David.

20:09.086 --> 20:10.217
Rocketed up

20:10.260 --> 20:12.521
the ranks of the Mossad.

20:12.565 --> 20:13.913
Reports says David is

20:13.956 --> 20:15.913
voluntary inactive.

20:15.956 --> 20:18.043
Went off the deep end

20:18.086 --> 20:20.478
after his wife ditched him
for somebody else.

20:20.521 --> 20:23.000
I guess he came here
to smoke the pain away

20:23.043 --> 20:24.434
and make threats.

20:24.478 --> 20:26.347
No, it didn't feel
like a threat.

20:26.391 --> 20:28.173
It felt like a warning.

20:28.217 --> 20:29.652
He said the Russian's team
would kill me

20:29.695 --> 20:31.217
if they figured out
who I was working for.

20:33.304 --> 20:36.391
Does he know more
about the Russian than we do?

20:36.434 --> 20:40.739
If the Russian were
as dangerous as David said,

20:40.782 --> 20:44.000
the home office would have
never sent someone so green.

20:44.043 --> 20:47.043
Look at me.

20:47.086 --> 20:49.434
You got a knack for this,

20:49.478 --> 20:51.521
but if you want out
of the game...

20:53.304 --> 20:55.652
I got to be me.

20:55.695 --> 20:57.434
[laughs]

20:59.478 --> 21:01.347
Be you.

21:15.347 --> 21:18.521
Liat, search
the right side.

21:18.565 --> 21:19.521
I'm gonna
check the shul.

21:26.565 --> 21:30.304
The second word
was knesset.

21:30.347 --> 21:32.086
The word you removed.

21:32.130 --> 21:33.608
Beyt knesset.

21:35.652 --> 21:39.130
But just...
one question.

21:39.173 --> 21:41.260
Why did you not trust me?

21:41.304 --> 21:42.782
You're not with us.

21:42.826 --> 21:45.869
Aba! Show yourself!

21:45.913 --> 21:47.217
Are you an idiot?

21:47.260 --> 21:49.347
We're not looking
for the afikomen.

21:49.391 --> 21:51.695
He can hear us
if we call him.

21:51.739 --> 21:52.695
Yes, but you don't know
who else might hear.

21:52.739 --> 21:53.739
Aba!

21:53.782 --> 21:55.391
You stop!

21:55.434 --> 21:56.782
[grunting]

22:13.826 --> 22:15.782
VANCE: Does he know more
about the Russian than we do?

22:29.391 --> 22:31.173
You have a problem.

22:31.217 --> 22:32.782
[man speaks Russian]

22:34.782 --> 22:37.000
The American has
orders to kill you.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.521
I know.

22:46.521 --> 22:48.260
[both grunting]

22:58.652 --> 23:00.521
ELI:
Stop this!

23:02.304 --> 23:03.521
What are you doing?

23:05.391 --> 23:06.478
He is coming
with me, Malachi.

23:06.521 --> 23:07.521
He's not going anywhere.

23:07.565 --> 23:09.913
Liat, you do not answer for me.

23:09.956 --> 23:11.173
Hadar is dead.

23:11.217 --> 23:12.782
Director Vance is nearly so.

23:14.478 --> 23:17.043
Everyone has questions for you.

23:17.086 --> 23:19.434
Then you take me to NCIS.

23:19.478 --> 23:21.956
You will have your answers.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.869
[panting]

23:29.304 --> 23:31.782
McGyver.
It's so obvious.

23:31.826 --> 23:33.608
I mean, why didn't
I come up with that?

23:33.652 --> 23:35.260
You got any you've been
holding in reserve,

23:35.304 --> 23:36.826
waiting for
the perfect opportunity?

23:36.869 --> 23:38.434
That's not how
my mind works.

23:38.478 --> 23:40.260
I mean, it's
like scat in there.

23:40.304 --> 23:42.347
Ah, yes-- animal dung.
I always figured.

23:43.478 --> 23:44.695
Not animal dung.

23:44.739 --> 23:47.043
It's like jive, you know?
It's like bebop.

23:47.086 --> 23:48.608
It's unpredictable.

23:48.652 --> 23:50.826
I'll take the guitar.
You take lead vocals.

23:50.869 --> 23:51.826
Like McGlee, McFlee.

23:51.869 --> 23:53.869
McG-flat.

23:53.913 --> 23:55.782
McJagger.

23:55.826 --> 23:58.000
What's the news,
Hebrews?

23:58.043 --> 23:59.826
Director Vance is in recovery.

23:59.869 --> 24:02.434
He has not yet
regained consciousness.

24:02.478 --> 24:03.826
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey!

24:03.869 --> 24:05.434
You don't have to "Gibbs up"
the clicker there.

24:05.478 --> 24:06.782
Hey, where is Boss,
anyway?

24:06.826 --> 24:07.782
He's in Interrogation.

24:07.826 --> 24:08.956
With Director David.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.391
Oh!

24:10.434 --> 24:11.565
This is like
Clash of the Titans.

24:11.608 --> 24:12.913
We should be there.

24:12.956 --> 24:14.304
It's a closed show.

24:14.347 --> 24:15.217
Come on... [grunts]

24:16.217 --> 24:18.173
Nice.
Sorry.

24:18.217 --> 24:20.260
Well, tell Abby to come up
and get this stuff.

24:20.304 --> 24:22.565
I can hack the feed.TONY: Yes, you can.

24:29.130 --> 24:32.608
Leon and I are forged
in fire and blood.

24:32.652 --> 24:34.043
[whispers]:
Good job.

24:34.086 --> 24:37.347
So, you met for the
first time in Amsterdam?

24:40.347 --> 24:43.391
This file is not
the complete picture.

24:43.434 --> 24:46.260
Leon and I were had hoped
to reveal all sides

24:46.304 --> 24:47.478
during the review conference.

24:47.521 --> 24:49.608
You two arranged this
conference together?

24:49.652 --> 24:51.521
Yes.

24:51.565 --> 24:54.565
I urged Leon
to include Amsterdam.

24:57.086 --> 25:00.695
His role in that mission
was not what he was told.

25:00.739 --> 25:03.521
Did you know that?

25:03.565 --> 25:05.652
[chuckles]

25:05.695 --> 25:07.434
In the almost 20 years since,

25:07.478 --> 25:09.956
all of the players have
scattered around the globe.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.913
You found them.

25:11.956 --> 25:13.782
Director Vance invited them.

25:13.826 --> 25:15.826
To unearth what?

25:15.869 --> 25:18.739
Not what. Who.

25:18.782 --> 25:21.043
Who is it

25:21.086 --> 25:23.304
that wants
Leon dead, Gibbs?

25:25.652 --> 25:28.000
The Russian operative.
His name is redacted.

25:28.043 --> 25:31.043
I never knew his name.

25:31.086 --> 25:33.304
Another detail
I had hoped to uncover.

25:33.347 --> 25:36.347
According to Vance's report,

25:36.391 --> 25:39.478
you yourself told the Russian

25:39.521 --> 25:41.869
that Vance was sent
there to kill him?

25:41.913 --> 25:44.478
Yes. That is true.

25:44.521 --> 25:47.000
So you knew that that
made Vance a target.

25:47.043 --> 25:49.347
Yes. It did.

25:51.739 --> 25:54.478
[door squeaks open,
then closes]

26:00.000 --> 26:02.521
Are you the type who's grumpy
when you get woken up?

26:02.565 --> 26:04.869
I saw you talk to
the Russian about me.

26:04.913 --> 26:06.521
I saw you seeing me.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.130
He's going to kill me.

26:08.173 --> 26:09.260
He was going to kill you anyway.

26:09.304 --> 26:11.347
Now, he's going to do it sooner.

26:11.391 --> 26:12.956
He knew already
who you are.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.913
No. That's not possible.

26:15.956 --> 26:17.739
Mm. Come on.
Get up.

26:17.782 --> 26:19.347
Get out!

26:19.391 --> 26:22.304
If I leave, you die.

26:31.695 --> 26:34.000
There is another box
in the hall.

26:34.043 --> 26:36.000
We cannot wait.

26:36.043 --> 26:39.043
It will not be long before the
Russian contacts his hit team.

26:39.086 --> 26:40.086
They will be here
by morning.

26:40.130 --> 26:41.608
How?

26:41.652 --> 26:44.478
I told him where
you were staying.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.304
Leon never forgets anything.

26:53.347 --> 26:55.826
Did you know that about him?

26:55.869 --> 26:57.826
I do.

27:00.304 --> 27:02.217
It is what saved
his life this morning.

27:02.260 --> 27:05.304
When we walked
in that door,

27:05.347 --> 27:07.608
he had seen it before.

27:13.260 --> 27:15.608
Good. Don't pack
it too tight.

27:15.652 --> 27:17.391
There has to be
air in between.

27:19.913 --> 27:21.652
[rattling]

27:25.391 --> 27:26.956
We had a plan, you know.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.869
NIS had a plan.

27:28.913 --> 27:30.304
What was it?

27:30.347 --> 27:32.000
I don't know all of it.

27:32.043 --> 27:32.956
If I could contact my handler...

27:33.000 --> 27:34.391
Oh, yes.

27:34.434 --> 27:36.478
That is a good idea.
Why don't you do that,

27:36.521 --> 27:38.739
if you think there is time.
In the meantime,

27:38.782 --> 27:40.347
cut where I have
marked on here.

27:43.217 --> 27:45.043
I want to know why
you think it's your business

27:45.086 --> 27:46.608
to screw up our mission.

27:46.652 --> 27:50.130
How can you not see
that you are disposable?

27:52.086 --> 27:53.826
How can you not know that?

27:55.608 --> 27:58.391
Tell me.

27:58.434 --> 28:00.217
Who will cry for you

28:00.260 --> 28:03.173
if this blasting cap
should accidentally blow up

28:03.217 --> 28:06.260
and turn us
to smears on the wall?

28:06.304 --> 28:08.086
Who'll cry for you?

28:08.130 --> 28:10.217
I have children.

28:10.260 --> 28:12.826
Then what are you doing?

28:12.869 --> 28:14.826
Why would you lure
a hit team here?

28:14.869 --> 28:16.434
Because....

28:16.478 --> 28:19.826
Mossad told me
I could kill them.

28:19.869 --> 28:21.347
The Russian...

28:21.391 --> 28:22.521
[blows air]

28:22.565 --> 28:24.565
...turned an Israeli sailor,

28:24.608 --> 28:26.565
bled him dry for information,

28:26.608 --> 28:30.086
then sent a hit team to dispose
of my fellow countryman.

28:30.130 --> 28:32.608
My wife...

28:32.652 --> 28:35.347
can no longer
live with what I do.

28:35.391 --> 28:38.652
She took my family,
my children,

28:38.695 --> 28:42.826
to ensure that they do not grow
up to be like their father.

28:42.869 --> 28:45.000
This I cannot fight.

28:45.043 --> 28:48.565
I need a target.

28:48.608 --> 28:51.956
I need a target.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.043
I told him.

28:54.086 --> 28:57.304
Before there is
nothing left of me.

28:57.347 --> 28:59.043
He knew how to do it.

28:59.086 --> 29:01.826
He just confessed to knowing
how to build the murder weapon.

29:01.869 --> 29:03.782
I mean, come on.

29:03.826 --> 29:06.739
How many know how to build
a homemade claymore mine?

29:06.782 --> 29:08.086
In this room?

29:11.391 --> 29:14.217
Okay, fine.

29:14.260 --> 29:15.347
If you believe
what he says,

29:15.391 --> 29:16.956
then you have to believe
there was a leak

29:17.000 --> 29:18.173
in your own
organization,

29:18.217 --> 29:19.869
and your people
refuse to see it.

29:19.913 --> 29:21.521
Uh, no, that just means

29:21.565 --> 29:24.000
that the Russian
wanted Vance dead then

29:24.043 --> 29:25.043
and probably still
wants him dead now.

29:25.086 --> 29:26.434
We got to find him.

29:26.478 --> 29:27.652
If that is the case,

29:27.695 --> 29:29.173
it was your director,
not ours,

29:29.217 --> 29:30.608
who was
the intended target.

29:30.652 --> 29:32.217
Hadar is dead because
of your incompetence.

29:32.260 --> 29:34.347
Our incompetence?

29:34.391 --> 29:35.826
Your protocols.

29:35.869 --> 29:37.478
The PRF attack was public.

29:37.521 --> 29:39.652
Sending both directors
back to your safe house.

29:39.695 --> 29:41.043
Maybe you are leaking still.

29:41.086 --> 29:42.782
And maybe my
father is lying.

29:42.826 --> 29:44.826
That is what he does.

29:44.869 --> 29:46.391
For those lacking actual
business to perform,

29:46.434 --> 29:49.130
might I suggest
a visit to the hospital?

29:49.173 --> 29:51.695
I'm sure blood donors
will be welcome.

29:55.521 --> 29:56.782
Ducky.

29:56.826 --> 29:58.217
Special Agent Sharp.

29:58.260 --> 30:00.130
She was a recruiting
specialist?

30:00.173 --> 30:01.521
Agent training, as well.

30:01.565 --> 30:02.782
And for a time,

30:02.826 --> 30:05.173
she was a fine field
agent in her own right.

30:05.217 --> 30:06.391
I'm sure she was fine.

30:06.434 --> 30:09.478
She still is.
But she chose Vance.

30:09.521 --> 30:11.260
She prepared him
for the mission.

30:11.304 --> 30:13.086
She knew everything.

30:13.130 --> 30:14.173
Am I nuts, or...?

30:14.217 --> 30:15.521
Yes, you are.

30:15.565 --> 30:17.217
Although,
having had the opportunity

30:17.260 --> 30:19.434
to get to know
Director Vance,

30:19.478 --> 30:22.000
he does seem an
odd choice for her.

30:22.043 --> 30:24.913
She had a preference
for policemen.

30:28.260 --> 30:29.913
ELI:
Leon was credited

30:29.956 --> 30:32.521
with the role he played
in eliminating the hit team.

30:32.565 --> 30:35.217
The Russian vanished
from Holland.

30:35.260 --> 30:38.130
I was not able
to keep track of him.

30:38.173 --> 30:39.652
It was at that time

30:39.695 --> 30:42.260
that I was being
reinstated to Mossad.

30:44.086 --> 30:45.608
And resuming your
rise to the top.

30:51.086 --> 30:53.130
You make it sound
like fait accompli.

30:53.173 --> 30:55.913
You have no idea
what it was like

30:55.956 --> 30:57.608
in that dingy little room.

30:57.652 --> 31:00.260
Neither one of us had any idea

31:00.304 --> 31:02.086
of what we were about to start.

31:11.043 --> 31:12.304
[faucet squeaks, shower runs]

31:14.695 --> 31:16.260
[shower running]

31:16.304 --> 31:18.652
VANCE: I turned on the shower.
Now what?

31:18.695 --> 31:21.391
Keep watching.

31:24.391 --> 31:26.043
VANCE:
They're here.

31:27.260 --> 31:28.739
They're coming
in the building.

31:28.782 --> 31:29.652
Shh, shh.

31:29.695 --> 31:31.043
[door shuts in distance]

31:31.086 --> 31:32.130
Get down.[footsteps approaching]

31:40.260 --> 31:42.608
[footsteps drawing closer]

31:42.652 --> 31:44.478
What's your daughter's name?

31:44.521 --> 31:48.217
I have two.

31:48.260 --> 31:51.434
Tali and Ziva.

31:54.521 --> 31:56.478
ELI: You may want
to cover your ears.

32:30.869 --> 32:31.826
[explosion booms]

32:31.869 --> 32:33.826
[startled grunt]

32:41.086 --> 32:42.869
Sir.

32:42.913 --> 32:44.739
[knocks]

32:44.782 --> 32:45.652
[Vance grunting]

32:48.086 --> 32:49.608
Leon, take it easy.
What are you doing?

32:49.652 --> 32:51.130
I got to go to
the bathroom.

32:51.173 --> 32:52.565
That's a good thing, man.

32:52.608 --> 32:54.086
What do you think
that tube is for?

32:54.130 --> 32:55.043
[sighs]

32:57.869 --> 33:00.608
Your wife go
to get the kids?

33:00.652 --> 33:01.913
Mm-hmm.

33:01.956 --> 33:05.913
Jackie caught me up on
everything I missed.

33:05.956 --> 33:07.130
[grunts]

33:09.304 --> 33:12.434
You talked to Eli.

33:12.478 --> 33:15.043
Yeah, he told me
about the Russian.

33:15.086 --> 33:19.043
Eli doesn't think that
this attack was the Russian

33:19.086 --> 33:20.695
out for revenge.

33:20.739 --> 33:23.086
No, he thinks
it was one of ours.

33:23.130 --> 33:24.739
He always has.

33:24.782 --> 33:27.434
[sighs]

33:27.478 --> 33:29.260
I don't know what happened
to the Russian

33:29.304 --> 33:31.391
after Amsterdam, Gibbs.

33:31.434 --> 33:34.217
Shake the tree.

33:34.260 --> 33:37.000
Someone at that conference
must know.

33:38.391 --> 33:41.391
How long has this
been cooking, Leon?

33:41.434 --> 33:45.173
SECNAV signed off
almost two years ago.

33:45.217 --> 33:47.391
Even the
suggestion

33:47.434 --> 33:51.304
of a dirty house
back in the day is unacceptable.

33:51.347 --> 33:55.304
[grunts]
Hey, easy, man.

33:55.347 --> 33:57.565
Ah, I never felt so weak.

33:59.521 --> 34:00.565
So vulnerable.

34:13.173 --> 34:14.652
Rule number nine.

34:16.739 --> 34:19.173
How the hell did you
get that past security?

34:23.217 --> 34:26.478
[whispering]: Never go
anywhere without a knife.

34:32.608 --> 34:34.739
Gibbs.

34:34.782 --> 34:37.260
I don't care...

34:37.304 --> 34:40.391
I don't care if they were us
before we were us.

34:40.434 --> 34:42.652
I don't care

34:42.695 --> 34:46.521
if they built NCIS
brick by brick.

34:51.217 --> 34:53.217
Hey, boss.

34:53.260 --> 34:54.608
Israelis.

34:54.652 --> 34:56.521
Making travel plans
for their fallen comrade.

34:56.565 --> 34:57.521
Abby.

34:57.565 --> 34:58.565
She hit
a brick wall.

34:58.608 --> 34:59.782
If we want to solve
Hadar's murder,

34:59.826 --> 35:00.956
we got to start
playing the game

35:01.000 --> 35:02.434
better than the guys
who made the rules.

35:02.478 --> 35:03.913
That's a good
place to start.

35:05.086 --> 35:07.304
You wrote the book.

35:07.347 --> 35:09.478
I'm saving my royalties
to buy a pack of gum.

35:09.521 --> 35:13.304
Hey, it's not a joke.

35:13.347 --> 35:16.130
"Information Security,"
"Redaction,"

35:16.173 --> 35:17.130
"Witness Protection."

35:17.173 --> 35:18.565
Those are
chapter headings.

35:18.608 --> 35:21.260
So is "Interrogation."

35:21.304 --> 35:22.652
Want to try
a different angle here,

35:22.695 --> 35:25.173
maybe tell me
what I'm being accused of?

35:27.130 --> 35:29.347
Amsterdam.

35:29.391 --> 35:31.347
What made you choose
Leon Vance?

35:31.391 --> 35:33.739
That's my crime?

35:33.782 --> 35:35.695
For picking the man
who would become the director?

35:35.739 --> 35:37.826
Well, yeah,
he didn't exactly fit

35:37.869 --> 35:40.130
your "ideal agent
parameters."

35:40.173 --> 35:43.347
[sighs]

35:43.391 --> 35:45.130
Look, back then we
were thin in Europe.

35:45.173 --> 35:46.913
Post the Gulf War,

35:46.956 --> 35:49.782
all resources were being
diverted to the Middle East.

35:49.826 --> 35:53.434
I scoured the academies
looking for smart candidates,

35:53.478 --> 35:54.782
unafraid of risk.

35:54.826 --> 35:56.173
Yeah, 'cause it was dangerous.

35:56.217 --> 35:58.130
Yeah.
Yeah, nobody's
gonna miss

35:58.173 --> 35:59.695
a poor black guy when
everything went wrong.

35:59.739 --> 36:00.956
No.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.478
I mean, yeah, he
had no family,

36:02.521 --> 36:04.695
but Vance was
qualified.

36:04.739 --> 36:06.347
How?

36:06.391 --> 36:08.652
What in his background
made him qualified?

36:08.695 --> 36:11.043
Let's just say that there
were inconsistencies

36:11.086 --> 36:12.826
in his background that
he obviously preferred

36:12.869 --> 36:14.391
we not explore.

36:14.434 --> 36:15.956
You threatened him.No, I did not.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.652
Yeah, you did, you leveraged him
right into the meat grinder.

36:18.695 --> 36:19.782
You worked with
McCallister.

36:19.826 --> 36:21.173
You know he would
have had his back

36:21.217 --> 36:23.000
had Eli not gotten
in between them.

36:24.826 --> 36:27.608
The Russian
was a killer.

36:27.652 --> 36:28.608
[chuckles]

36:28.652 --> 36:32.130
Not for sport,
only for cash.

36:32.173 --> 36:33.652
Some Communist, huh?

36:33.695 --> 36:35.826
You knew him?

36:35.869 --> 36:37.695
Only what I read in
McCallister's mission plan.

36:40.086 --> 36:42.739
Wait a minute, who do you
think would have paid

36:42.782 --> 36:44.347
this guy to kill Vance?

36:44.391 --> 36:45.565
You remember the Russian's name?

36:45.608 --> 36:47.043
It was...

36:47.086 --> 36:51.391
uh, something with a Z and
a V, like Zurov, Zubov...

36:51.434 --> 36:53.347
Zukov?

36:53.391 --> 36:55.217
Yeah.
Anatoly Zukov?

36:55.260 --> 36:57.260
Yeah, that's him.

36:57.304 --> 36:59.043
Wait a minute,
that's him.

36:59.086 --> 37:01.826
You think, what, he came back
to clean up after himself?

37:01.869 --> 37:03.652
No.

37:03.695 --> 37:04.913
No, he's long gone.

37:04.956 --> 37:06.130
You sure?

37:06.173 --> 37:08.043
Yes, I'm positive.

37:17.173 --> 37:18.739
[door opening]

37:23.565 --> 37:26.086
You're doing all right.

37:26.130 --> 37:28.739
And you're disappointed.

37:28.782 --> 37:31.608
While I was
sleeping, I...

37:31.652 --> 37:36.130
I had what they call
a moment of clarity.

37:36.173 --> 37:37.913
My life is a lie.

37:37.956 --> 37:38.913
[chuckles]

37:38.956 --> 37:41.130
I know that.

37:41.173 --> 37:45.739
I always thought I was chosen
because I was special.

37:45.782 --> 37:49.000
That's not it at all.

37:49.043 --> 37:50.782
You chose me because you knew

37:50.826 --> 37:53.043
nobody would miss me
when I got killed.

37:53.086 --> 37:56.043
Oh, not true.

37:56.086 --> 37:59.043
Would've been a great tragedy.

37:59.086 --> 38:00.956
American sailor murdered

38:01.000 --> 38:03.434
by a Russian operative.

38:03.478 --> 38:07.043
Agency would've been
up in arms.

38:07.086 --> 38:10.043
The world was shifting
away from you.

38:10.086 --> 38:11.478
My death
would have put

38:11.521 --> 38:15.043
the focus back
on your area of expertise,

38:15.086 --> 38:16.695
and then...

38:16.739 --> 38:21.652
Instead of becoming SAC
of the San Diego Field Office,

38:21.695 --> 38:24.304
I would have been on the fast
track to the director's chair.

38:24.347 --> 38:27.652
You were stuck in the past.

38:27.695 --> 38:29.000
That's why forward thinkers

38:29.043 --> 38:31.304
got promoted
ahead of you,

38:31.347 --> 38:34.130
like Morrow,
like Shepard,

38:34.173 --> 38:36.043
like me.

38:36.086 --> 38:38.217
No wonder you wanted me dead
from day one.

38:39.956 --> 38:42.739
Hey, Riley,
what the hell is this?

38:42.782 --> 38:44.913
You putting this
in my permanent file?

38:44.956 --> 38:46.913
What are you doing
accessing your file?

38:46.956 --> 38:49.521
I was updating our Y2K
compliance protocols,

38:49.565 --> 38:53.043
as is my responsibility,
and I found this online.

38:53.086 --> 38:56.043
You and your computers are going
to be the death of me.

38:56.086 --> 38:58.043
This says I'm a pilot

38:58.086 --> 39:00.173
and I was the director
of a field office.

39:00.217 --> 39:01.608
Pretty ridiculous, huh?

39:01.652 --> 39:04.043
Are you backstopping me
for another mission?

39:04.086 --> 39:05.826
I told you that's not
where my interests lie.

39:05.869 --> 39:08.608
You'll take the assignments
I give you, Leon.

39:08.652 --> 39:12.434
You were never supposed
to succeed.

39:12.478 --> 39:15.521
You think your legacy can live

39:15.565 --> 39:19.000
by killing Eli
and by killing me?

39:19.043 --> 39:20.043
[grunting]

39:22.826 --> 39:24.434
[beeping]

39:28.043 --> 39:29.826
[alarm beeping rapidly]Shh-shh, shh-shh...

39:38.000 --> 39:40.260
[groaning quietly]

39:40.304 --> 39:44.391
For once, can't you
just die right?

39:49.260 --> 39:50.652
[thud, blade rings]

39:50.695 --> 39:51.869
[groaning]

39:51.913 --> 39:53.043
[thud]

39:53.086 --> 39:54.913
[gasping]

40:03.173 --> 40:06.652
[panting]

40:09.478 --> 40:10.956
[beeping]

40:11.000 --> 40:13.347
Yes, what is the...?

40:13.391 --> 40:14.565
Code blue!

40:17.086 --> 40:18.304
WOMAN [over intercom]:
Code blue alert.

40:18.347 --> 40:19.913
Emergency personnel
to room 202.

40:19.956 --> 40:22.695
Code blue alert.

40:23.739 --> 40:25.478
[doctor speaking quietly]

40:27.347 --> 40:28.434
[Vance groans]

40:47.695 --> 40:48.695
Damn it, Riley!

40:48.739 --> 40:50.782
Hey.

40:50.826 --> 40:53.130
That's my Danish.

40:53.173 --> 40:56.217
What is your problem, man?

40:56.260 --> 40:59.130
It's my bad.

40:59.173 --> 41:00.434
I'll get you back for that.

41:00.478 --> 41:02.652
Yeah, you will.

41:02.695 --> 41:04.695
Gibbs, Leon...

41:04.739 --> 41:07.391
Leon, Gibbs.

41:07.434 --> 41:08.956
I'll remember.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.913
Me, too.

41:14.043 --> 41:16.869
Where were we?

41:20.217 --> 41:22.391
Some assignment in Paris.

41:22.434 --> 41:24.391
Decker's on point.

41:24.434 --> 41:26.434
I want you in on it.

41:26.478 --> 41:28.347
You ever worked
with Jenny Shepard?

41:32.086 --> 41:34.565
McGEE:
Want you to know

41:34.608 --> 41:37.043
that we're truly sorry
about Hadar.

41:37.086 --> 41:38.695
MALACHI:
Thank you.

41:38.739 --> 41:40.913
TONY: We know how it feels
to lose a teammate.

41:40.956 --> 41:42.260
When your whole
country could be

41:42.304 --> 41:44.478
wiped away any day,
you don't take

41:44.521 --> 41:46.130
tomorrow for granted.

41:46.173 --> 41:48.565
That's terrifying.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
It was meant
to be comforting.

42:03.869 --> 42:05.956
[sighs]

42:06.521 --> 42:09.869
There have been times I...

42:09.913 --> 42:13.782
felt this job take
a piece of me.

42:18.826 --> 42:22.521
I worry they may be
gone forever.

42:24.739 --> 42:30.000
Sometimes life...
surprises you.

42:44.652 --> 42:48.391
Those are the moments
worth living for.

42:51.391 --> 42:53.652
My Ziva.
