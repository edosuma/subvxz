00:08.500 --> 00:11.879
ATLANTA, GEORGIA

00:37.830 --> 00:40.572
-I feel stupid.
-You look amazing. Drink.

00:50.290 --> 00:53.578
-I'm going home.
-No, come on. It's just an off night.

00:53.580 --> 00:57.118
At any moment, Mr. Right is going to
walk through that...

00:59.580 --> 01:01.491
-Oh, my.
-Is he cute?

01:01.500 --> 01:02.706
Better.

01:14.830 --> 01:16.161
Have a drink.

01:18.790 --> 01:20.951
Vanessa Holden, age 25.

01:21.290 --> 01:24.077
Last Friday night
she was clubbing with her sister.

01:24.080 --> 01:27.413
A stranger, white male,
roughly her age, picked her up.

01:27.420 --> 01:30.412
00 am,
went back to her place.

01:30.420 --> 01:32.991
He forced her on her hands and knees,

01:33.710 --> 01:36.372
and then he cut her open,
just below the stomach.

01:36.380 --> 01:37.529
Whoa.

01:37.540 --> 01:39.030
Yeah. Pretty rough.

01:39.040 --> 01:41.417
Gutting causes the intestines
to spill out.

01:41.420 --> 01:45.379
You can survive for a few hours,
actually. Even days.

01:45.380 --> 01:48.452
00 am.

01:48.460 --> 01:51.952
So he disemboweled her,
but didn't kill her for four hours.

01:51.960 --> 01:53.200
Could be a sexual sadist.

01:53.210 --> 01:57.249
Yeah, I thought so, too,
but I found two priors from a year ago.

01:57.250 --> 01:59.241
Prostitutes, actually, in motel rooms.

01:59.250 --> 02:00.786
Okay, so keep running with it.

02:00.790 --> 02:03.668
Why do you think this is the same UnSub?

02:03.670 --> 02:06.662
In Vanessa Holden's apartment,
the following were discovered.

02:06.670 --> 02:10.788
Bleach, ammonia, trash bags,
all in a triangular pattern.

02:11.830 --> 02:16.244
One year ago, motel rooms.
Bleach, ammonia, trash bags,

02:16.250 --> 02:18.241
also in a triangular pattern.

02:18.250 --> 02:21.617
-He's cleaning up.
-Maybe trying to hide his tracks.

02:21.620 --> 02:23.247
It could be a sign of remorse.

02:23.250 --> 02:26.117
Apologizing for the murder
by minimizing the mess.

02:26.120 --> 02:28.031
But there's one other commonality

02:28.040 --> 02:29.667
between both sets of murders.

02:29.670 --> 02:32.878
Bleach and ammonia were found
under the Victims' ﬁngernails.

02:36.170 --> 02:38.991
He's making them clean up
their own murder.

02:39.710 --> 02:41.496
It's the same UnSub.

03:17.250 --> 03:21.072
Autho_r Harlan Ellison _
wrote, "The minute people fall In love,

03:21.080 --> 03:22.820
"they become liars."

03:23.380 --> 03:25.371
So if the UnSub changed victimology,

03:25.380 --> 03:27.780
does that make him organized
or disorganized?

03:27.790 --> 03:30.372
Well, prostitutes point one way,
club girls another.

03:30.380 --> 03:33.998
The triangular arrangement
of the cleaning supplies is interesting.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.491
-Obsessive-compulsive?
-Might have been institutionalized.

03:36.500 --> 03:38.411
We're missing the forest
for the trees here.

03:38.420 --> 03:41.321
This guy started with prostitutes,
a high-risk victimology,

03:41.330 --> 03:43.992
took a year off, came back,
killed a socialite.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.820
No forced entry, no coercion of any kind.

03:45.830 --> 03:50.199
Exactly. So how does our UnSub
go from Loser of the Year to Don Juan?

03:50.210 --> 03:51.916
Actually, as Byron interpreted him,

03:51.920 --> 03:55.458
Don Juan was an ironic reversal
of sex roles, and when...

03:57.080 --> 03:58.320
And that's about it.

03:58.330 --> 03:59.661
Something must have happened

03:59.670 --> 04:01.615
between the last prostitute
and Vanessa Holden

04:01.620 --> 04:03.611
to make him change his victimology.

04:03.620 --> 04:05.827
Could the UnSub have known Vanessa?

04:05.830 --> 04:07.957
It's unlikely.
Sexual sadists attack anonymously.

04:07.960 --> 04:09.496
They have to sever a personal connection

04:09.500 --> 04:13.118
and see their victims as objects
to perpetrate this level of torture.

04:13.120 --> 04:14.872
We have to build two profiles, then.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.495
One for the UnSub who killed prostitutes,

04:16.500 --> 04:18.491
one for the UnSub who goes to clubs.

04:18.500 --> 04:21.378
Prentiss is right.

04:21.380 --> 04:23.780
The victimology's so different,
we treat them as separate UnSubs

04:23.790 --> 04:25.200
and see what overlaps.

04:25.210 --> 04:28.873
Reid, work up a geographic profile,
focus on the location of the murders.

04:28.880 --> 04:30.950
Prentiss and Rossi,
concentrate on the prostitutes.

04:30.960 --> 04:33.497
Jordan, Morgan and I
will go deal with Vanessa Holden.

04:34.670 --> 04:37.662
ATLANTA POLICE DEPARTMENT

04:40.210 --> 04:43.168
Detective Harding? Hi. Agent Jordan Todd.

04:43.170 --> 04:46.571
-Thank you for coming.
-SSAs Hotchner, Morgan, Dr. Reid.

04:46.580 --> 04:47.820
-How you doing

04:47.830 --> 04:50.572
Is there a DNA match
between the UnSub and the prostitutes

04:50.580 --> 04:52.571
we can run through ViCAP, just in case?

04:52.580 --> 04:54.571
There's no DNA at all.

04:54.580 --> 04:58.459
No prints, no fibers. Just like Vanessa,
everything gets cleaned up.

04:58.460 --> 05:00.416
Pretty effective forensic countermeasure.

05:00.420 --> 05:02.570
What about witnesses? _
Somebody must have seen something.

05:02.580 --> 05:05.492
-Oh, yeah. Lots of people.
-So you have a sketch.

05:09.620 --> 05:11.076
That's a little vague.

05:11.080 --> 05:15.039
That's because of this guy's
other countermeasure. Take a look.

05:17.170 --> 05:20.287
So this guy right here? That's our killer.

05:20.290 --> 05:21.530
Looks like a fedora.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.288
So he's drawing attention to his face
while simultaneously obscuring it.

05:25.290 --> 05:26.666
It's called "peacocking."

05:26.670 --> 05:28.877
The adornment
of some sort of flashy affect

05:28.880 --> 05:31.110
to sort of try to distract witnesses.

05:31.120 --> 05:33.452
So none of your witness statements agree?

05:33.460 --> 05:35.610
"He had a mole." "He didn't have a mole."

05:35.620 --> 05:38.282
"He had a gap between his teeth."
"No, his teeth were perfect."

05:38.290 --> 05:40.997
Detective, we're gonna have to have
a sit-down with Ashley Holden.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.117
-She got the best look at the UnSub.
-Well, I wish I could make that happen,

05:44.120 --> 05:46.827
but unfortunately the family
has decided to stop cooperating.

05:46.830 --> 05:49.242
-Why is that?
-They wouldn't say.

05:49.250 --> 05:51.115
Yesterday the mother would move
heaven and Earth

05:51.120 --> 05:52.417
to help find her daughter's killer.

05:52.420 --> 05:53.569
Today, no thanks.

05:54.790 --> 05:56.030
I'll take care of this.

05:57.250 --> 05:59.377
Garcia, is there any leverage
you can give me

05:59.380 --> 06:00.995
that will help with the Holden family?

06:01.000 --> 06:03.116
Sugar, if they broke the law,
that'd be one thing,

06:03.120 --> 06:06.248
-but they haven't done anything wrong.
-What about public record?

06:06.250 --> 06:08.821
Anything that might explain
why the family shut down.

06:08.830 --> 06:11.162
I've got scads of blog postings on them.

06:11.170 --> 06:14.492
The Holdens were movers and shakers
in the city,

06:14.500 --> 06:17.378
-and nasty stuff follows money.
-Like what?

06:17.380 --> 06:19.416
"The Holdens got
what they had coming to them."

06:19.420 --> 06:21.490
"Why did Ashley get her sister killed?"

06:21.500 --> 06:24.037
Yikes, "How much to gut the slutty one?"

06:24.040 --> 06:26.247
Could you forward those to me?

06:30.080 --> 06:31.570
Good afternoon.

06:33.540 --> 06:36.828
I'm sorry you came all the way out here.
It's a waste of time.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.786
Ashley knows absolutely nothing,

06:38.790 --> 06:41.497
and we want to get this behind us
as soon as possible.

06:41.500 --> 06:45.539
Mrs. Holden, we can't begin to fathom
the loss you've suffered.

06:45.540 --> 06:47.496
That's right, you can't.

06:50.290 --> 06:51.450
But...

06:53.880 --> 06:59.705
I lost my older sister in a car crash,
and it was really hard on our family,

06:59.710 --> 07:01.666
because she was the responsible one.

07:01.670 --> 07:05.709
She was the one that my mother
always counted on to watch over us.

07:07.120 --> 07:10.612
And when she died,
my mother wouldn't let the police in.

07:11.170 --> 07:14.958
If she didn't let them in,
then my sister really wasn't dead.

07:16.120 --> 07:21.205
This man is a monster,
and we can catch him,

07:21.210 --> 07:23.610
but we need your daughter's help.

07:27.830 --> 07:30.537
-You accuse her of anything...
-Ma'am. Ma'am...

07:30.540 --> 07:34.203
-...I will be on the phone so fast...
-Ma'am. Ma'am. We won't.

07:40.330 --> 07:42.286
All right, follow me.

07:48.710 --> 07:50.746
Did you know that about Jordan?

07:50.750 --> 07:54.868
No, and neither did she. According
to her file, she's an only child.

07:59.330 --> 08:01.070
Vanessa's boyfriend just broke up
with her,

08:01.080 --> 08:03.617
so I took her out to, you know...

08:03.620 --> 08:06.373
To have a good time.
There's nothing wrong with that.

08:06.380 --> 08:08.951
-Were you approached by anyone?
-Guys.

08:09.790 --> 08:12.281
Can you describe any of them for us?

08:12.290 --> 08:15.532
Ordinary. Look,
Vanessa wasn't even in the mood.

08:15.960 --> 08:18.918
So, if she wasn't in the mood,
if she left with this guy,

08:18.920 --> 08:20.956
then there must have been
something about him.

08:20.960 --> 08:22.450
Something unique.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.109
We saw a picture of him
on surveillance,

08:24.120 --> 08:26.452
and we know
that he was dressed like a rocker.

08:26.460 --> 08:28.701
So he was pretty flashy, right?

08:29.710 --> 08:31.666
What was the first thing
you noticed about him?

08:31.670 --> 08:33.410
His attitude.

08:33.420 --> 08:38.448
What about it Confident

08:39.210 --> 08:41.576
No, he was, like... He was hitting on us,

08:41.580 --> 08:44.242
but he was, like, making a joke out of it
at the same time.

08:44.250 --> 08:49.244
Seriously, you don't recognize me?
I will give you three more guesses.

08:51.420 --> 08:54.742
You know, even his eyes,
they were different colors.

08:54.750 --> 08:56.490
So this guy wanted to be noticed.

08:56.500 --> 08:59.458
Yeah. That's why you go to a club, right?

09:00.500 --> 09:02.491
And then he had these games.

09:02.500 --> 09:06.322
Like, he would bet us drinks
that we couldn't get his number.

09:06.330 --> 09:07.786
Or this other one...

09:09.170 --> 09:12.162
Okay, let me make sure
you didn't screw it up.

09:12.620 --> 09:14.997
Wow. The camera really does add 10 pounds.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.572
What? You're such a jerk.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.491
She didn't even want to go out that night.

09:22.500 --> 09:24.912
I mean, I had to drag her to the club.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.207
The last thing she said to me

09:28.750 --> 09:33.164
before I left her alone with that guy was,
"I had the best time tonight.

09:33.750 --> 09:35.320
"The best time."

09:42.960 --> 09:45.531
The information about Vanessa Holden
being the responSIble srster,

09:45.540 --> 09:46.746
where did you get that?

09:46.750 --> 09:49.617
Some of it was online and some of it
was just an educated guess

09:49.620 --> 09:53.454
-based on birth order.
-A guess. And in the process, you lied.

09:53.920 --> 09:57.242
That mother was shut down.
I needed to salvage some rapport.

09:57.250 --> 09:58.956
I don't know how you did things
in counterterrorism,

09:58.960 --> 10:01.872
but we don't make it a habit to lie
to get the job done.

10:01.880 --> 10:04.201
I got you in the door, didn't I?

10:05.330 --> 10:08.914
Not only do you represent the FBI,
you represent this team.

10:08.920 --> 10:10.456
To the press, the police,

10:10.460 --> 10:11.575
and to the families who are struggling

10:11.580 --> 10:13.411
with some of the hardest times
of their lives.

10:13.420 --> 10:16.162
If you get caught in a lie,
the trust we depend on

10:16.170 --> 10:19.992
to help solve these crimes disappears.
Do I make myself clear?

10:20.960 --> 10:23.531
-It won't happen again.
-No, it won't.

10:24.830 --> 10:26.570
When you get back,
I want you to prepare a press release

10:26.580 --> 10:27.706
about the UnSub.

10:27.710 --> 10:31.032
Do not release it. From now on,
everything goes through me.

10:33.830 --> 10:35.161
Yeah, Dave.

10:42.920 --> 10:45.206
So how bad did I just screw up?

10:46.330 --> 10:49.709
On a normal scale of one to 10?
I'd say a srx.

10:50.420 --> 10:53.036
But on Hotch's scale? An 11.

10:56.540 --> 10:59.998
The UnSub killed the prostitutes
in separate pay-by-the-hour motels

11:00.000 --> 11:02.116
in Fulton County. Right there.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.327
One of the poorer neighborhoods
in the area.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.742
Now Vanessa Holden's apartment
was in the Peachtree District,

11:06.750 --> 11:08.320
where there's a lot of big money.

11:08.330 --> 11:10.742
Based on the geography,
he isn't just changing his victimology,

11:10.750 --> 11:12.286
he's changing his whole tax bracket.

11:12.290 --> 11:14.702
Well, the high profile
of Vanessa Holden bears that out.

11:14.710 --> 11:16.666
By killing her,
he was climbing the social ladder.

11:16.670 --> 11:19.537
If that's the case,
this UnSub had a long way to climb.

11:19.540 --> 11:22.998
Both prostitutes advertised here.
Look at their pictures.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.377
Subservient positioning.
Asking to be dominated.

11:25.380 --> 11:26.665
Promising to come to you.

11:26.670 --> 11:29.321
It cuts out the social interaction
of meeting on a street corner.

11:29.330 --> 11:32.117
That's a long way from a self-assured
UnSub who hits the clubs.

11:32.120 --> 11:34.031
Yeah, except he took a year off
between the murders.

11:34.040 --> 11:36.702
Maybe he took that time to change himself.

11:36.710 --> 11:38.325
-That's impossible.
-Why?

11:38.330 --> 11:40.878
Well, I mean, you're talking
about a total transformation here.

11:40.880 --> 11:44.281
I mean, how you talk, how you dress,
how you think about yourself.

11:44.290 --> 11:46.167
Difficult, maybe. Not impossible.

11:46.170 --> 11:47.535
He already started killing.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.326
There must have been a secondary trigger

11:49.330 --> 11:51.616
that motivated him to change who he was.

11:51.620 --> 11:54.578
So, if you're gonna transform yourself,
how would you do it?

11:54.580 --> 11:58.243
A steady diet
of self-help books. Start hitting the gym.

11:58.250 --> 11:59.660
You'd have to learn
how to read people.

11:59.670 --> 12:01.035
I mean, what is a pickup?

12:01.040 --> 12:02.496
It's basically just a profile.

12:02.500 --> 12:05.879
Decoding cues of interest
and recoding similar ones.

12:05.880 --> 12:08.610
If you're too obvious,
you turn off your target.

12:08.620 --> 12:11.498
If you're oblivious, your target
moves on to a better profiler.

12:11.500 --> 12:13.536
Doesn't sound like something
he could do on his own.

12:13.540 --> 12:15.371
No, he'd have to go
somewhere to learn it.

12:15.380 --> 12:17.496
Yeah, a self-help class, maybe?

12:17.500 --> 12:20.037
Wait a minute, come on.
An UnSub who kills prostitutes,

12:20.040 --> 12:22.747
is he really thinking about signing up
for a Tony Robbins seminar?

12:22.750 --> 12:24.820
He would, if he found the class

12:24.830 --> 12:27.287
in the same place
he found the prostitutes.

12:33.670 --> 12:35.319
I like your style.

12:47.960 --> 12:51.452
Well, preliminary autopsy came back.
The victim's name was Beclq Williams.

12:51.460 --> 12:53.496
-Was she dilslemboweled?
- o.

12:53.750 --> 12:55.820
_ And what's even weirder
IS the cleaning supplies were set out,

12:55.830 --> 12:57.821
but there was no traces of them
on her body.

12:57.830 --> 12:59.240
Why would the UnSub alter his signature

12:59.250 --> 13:02.071
and push her out
of an eighth-storey window?

13:02.080 --> 13:03.456
Escalating his sadism, maybe?

13:03.460 --> 13:06.611
Gutting and cleaning are what
he has to do to find release.

13:06.620 --> 13:08.076
He wouldn't change that.

13:08.080 --> 13:10.207
Well, why not? He's changed
everything else about himself.

13:10.210 --> 13:13.247
-Did anyone see the UnSub?
-No surveillance cameras at the club.

13:13.250 --> 13:16.117
Becky's friends say she was talking
to a guy with sunglasses.

13:16.120 --> 13:17.576
Sunglasses.

13:17.580 --> 13:19.070
So why did he pull out
the cleaning supplies

13:19.080 --> 13:20.377
and then not use them?

13:20.380 --> 13:23.918
On all the other scenes, the bottles
were arranged in a precise order.

13:23.920 --> 13:27.663
-Here, they're just part of the mess.
-Maybe she fought back,

13:27.670 --> 13:30.286
and when Becky went over the railing,
his routine had been compromised

13:30.290 --> 13:31.951
'cause he knew the police would respond.

13:31.960 --> 13:34.497
Or she could have jumped.

13:34.750 --> 13:37.321
Her nervous system is pumping adrenaline.

13:37.330 --> 13:39.571
Her fight-or-flight response kicks in.

13:39.880 --> 13:41.745
He's struck two Fridays in a row,

13:41.750 --> 13:44.958
and if his routine's been interrupted,
it might compel him to strike again.

13:44.960 --> 13:47.952
It's Saturday.
The clubs will be packed tonight.

13:47.960 --> 13:49.575
Take a look at the classes
the UnSub might have taken.

13:49.580 --> 13:51.571
We need to generate a suspect pool
as soon as possible.

13:51.580 --> 13:52.660
Okay.

13:54.380 --> 13:56.610
Can Detective Harding
get a copy of the sketch to Garcia?

13:56.620 --> 13:57.871
Did you find anything outside?

13:57.880 --> 14:01.327
No, but I think there might be
a new pattern emerging.

14:03.040 --> 14:05.110
-Garcia, are you ready?
-Sending it now.

14:05.120 --> 14:07.076
Please be aware that
30 minutes with Photoshop

14:07.080 --> 14:09.787
does not allow for much artistic flourish.

14:09.790 --> 14:12.452
Both times the UnSub has gone
into a club he's had some costume,

14:12.460 --> 14:14.325
but now there's a theme.

14:14.330 --> 14:18.619
Fedora and colored contacts,
sunglasses, each time obscuring...

14:19.000 --> 14:20.490
Ready, Garcia?

14:21.420 --> 14:25.038
This area. Now, yes, maybe he's trying
to draw attention to him,

14:25.040 --> 14:28.453
but maybe he's trying
to draw attention away from here.

14:28.460 --> 14:32.829
Something he knows is identifiable.
A birthmark or a scar, maybe.

14:32.830 --> 14:35.913
We need to get these out.
Jordan, release these to the press.

14:35.920 --> 14:40.243
Which is why we're encouraging women
to be on the lookout for this man.

14:40.580 --> 14:44.664
He has been seen at Club Omega,
Suffragette City,

14:44.670 --> 14:47.241
and we believe he may be attending
similar nightclubs

14:47.250 --> 14:49.115
in the midtown district.

14:49.120 --> 14:53.534
He may have a scar or a birthmark
on his left eye.

14:55.580 --> 14:59.164
Based on witness descriptions
and captured images,

14:59.500 --> 15:03.743
the suspect is white, mid-to-late 205,
and I repeat,

15:03.750 --> 15:07.459
Hotch?

15:07.460 --> 15:08.950
What'd you find out?

15:08.960 --> 15:12.532
Of the 20 self-described "pickup artist"
classes in the area,

15:12.540 --> 15:15.168
there's only one guy who encourages
his students

15:15.170 --> 15:17.161
to dress like space cowboys.

15:18.880 --> 15:20.996
Are you ready to meet Viper?

15:23.290 --> 15:26.077
Men are put on this Earth to hunt women.

15:27.250 --> 15:30.037
And even though women deny it,
they want to be hunted.

15:30.040 --> 15:31.496
They need it.

15:31.500 --> 15:34.321
It's part of our biological imperative
as animals.

15:34.330 --> 15:37.538
And the competition
the opposite sex puts you through?

15:37.540 --> 15:41.749
Pitting you against other guys

15:41.750 --> 15:44.071
It's all to reassure themselves

15:44.080 --> 15:47.493
that they have brought home
the best possible mate.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.706
'Cause just like you,

15:50.710 --> 15:55.158
they want someone who's gonna make
their eyeballs roll back in their head.

15:56.170 --> 16:01.244
My job is to help you slash
past every defense, every excuse,

16:01.250 --> 16:05.914
every "Why don't you meet my friend"
trick that they're gonna throw at you.

16:05.920 --> 16:09.242
You may not have ripped abs,
or afford table service,

16:09.580 --> 16:12.242
but if you're smarter

16:14.960 --> 16:18.578
and more interesting,
then you will be a better predator.

16:19.500 --> 16:24.494
Because this is the jungle, my friends,
and your prey wants to be caught.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.993
Will you listen to that language?
He's training serial killers.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.288
Great. We're dealing with
a rampant narcissistic and misogynist

16:32.290 --> 16:35.202
_ who's turned himself
Into a snake-orl salesman.

16:35.210 --> 16:38.498
Just one more thing he has in common
with our UnSub.

16:38.830 --> 16:42.743
So you think this... What'd you
call him

16:42.750 --> 16:46.459
He copied your "the camera
adds 10 pounds" routine verbatim.

16:46.710 --> 16:48.701
Yeah. That's a good gag.

16:49.460 --> 16:51.325
If you could just give us
your attendance lists,

16:51.330 --> 16:53.378
it might help us find him.

16:53.830 --> 16:56.242
-No.
-No?

16:57.040 --> 16:59.611
My clients expect
a certain amount of confidentiality.

16:59.620 --> 17:00.826
I won't compromise that.

17:00.830 --> 17:03.742
-We can come back with a warrant.
-Be my guest.

17:03.750 --> 17:04.876
But keep in mind, the money I make

17:04.880 --> 17:08.111
doesn't just pay
for my fabulous lifestyle.

17:08.120 --> 17:11.669
It also keeps some
very expensive lawyers on retainer.

17:11.670 --> 17:14.116
What club did you go to last night?

17:16.920 --> 17:21.493
It's a legitimate question. You seem
to know a lot about our investigation.

17:21.500 --> 17:23.320
Two things to learn about me.

17:23.330 --> 17:27.414
First, I outwit alpha males like you
for fun and sometimes profit.

17:28.580 --> 17:31.959
How often do you have to rely
on your badge to score, baldy?

17:31.960 --> 17:35.498
Second, last night, I was at Club Aqua,

17:35.500 --> 17:39.869
and I have a stack of tax-deductible
drink receipts to back up my story.

17:40.710 --> 17:43.201
Now, you might not want to believe
that my style works,

17:43.210 --> 17:47.499
and here in this harsh light,
you have the advantage.

17:50.420 --> 17:55.414
But meet me on my turf?
Oh, the things I could make you do.

17:58.290 --> 18:01.111
If you have any questions, give us a call.

18:08.580 --> 18:11.162
Please tell me
we are not gIVIng up on that guy.

18:11.170 --> 18:13.240
We're just getting started.

18:17.960 --> 18:20.246
He actually said that

18:20.250 --> 18:22.536
Yes, he did.
So what can you tell me about him?

18:22.540 --> 18:26.112
I can tell you the Viper's real name
is Paul Thomas,

18:26.120 --> 18:31.035
and before he rechristened himself,
he had a major mullet going on.

18:31.420 --> 18:34.287
Garcia, we need the names
of all of his students.

18:34.290 --> 18:36.872
I'm gonna need a couple hours
for work-around.

18:36.880 --> 18:40.668
I also need you to send Reid everything
you can about what this guy teaches.

18:40.670 --> 18:42.490
I think the UnSub's
using one of his routines.

18:42.500 --> 18:45.537
We need to start building
a linguistic profile.

18:45.540 --> 18:48.953
Sir, does this guy's stuff actually work?

18:49.250 --> 18:52.538
-On real, breathing girls

18:53.330 --> 18:56.322
I abhor the whole
"chicks dig jerks" thing.

18:56.330 --> 18:59.117
Well, fortunately, Garcia,
you're one of the exceptions.

18:59.120 --> 19:02.453
Well, be still my bespeckled heart,
so are you, sir.

19:03.620 --> 19:04.871
Thanks.

19:04.880 --> 19:09.169
Hotch? This is Melissa Foster.
She recognized the sketch.

19:10.040 --> 19:12.281
I'm SSA Hotchner. Thank you for coming in.

19:12.290 --> 19:14.281
You sure you've seen this man?

19:14.290 --> 19:16.326
Yeah. I gave him the scar.

19:17.420 --> 19:19.160
Did you meet him in a club?

19:19.170 --> 19:21.741
No. I was a prostitute.

19:24.080 --> 19:27.208
This happened about a year ago,
and I was in bad shape.

19:27.210 --> 19:29.826
-Heroin

19:32.750 --> 19:35.071
My girl Cheryl told me
ifI put an ad in the paper

19:35.080 --> 19:37.412
it'd be safer
than walking the streets, so...

19:37.420 --> 19:40.878
One day you got a call, right

19:40.880 --> 19:42.279
-Yeah.
-And when you walked in,

19:42.290 --> 19:45.953
you knew you were in trouble.
He couldn't meet your eye.

19:45.960 --> 19:49.532
He was kind of shifty, maybe?

19:50.080 --> 19:53.914
He paced. I spent the first half-hour
trying to get him to relax,

19:53.920 --> 19:58.118
'cause if he can relax then I can relax,
but he just wanted to rant.

19:58.540 --> 20:01.077
-What did he say?
-He said I was the help.

20:01.540 --> 20:05.374
They didn't even see you.
You're nothing. You're the help.

20:05.380 --> 20:07.701
I had customers like this
all the time.

20:08.710 --> 20:10.530
They work out one of two ways.

20:10.540 --> 20:13.532
Either they want to tie you up
and you say no,

20:13.540 --> 20:15.076
or they want to be tied up,

20:15.080 --> 20:19.039
in which case,
you do it and you steal their wallet.

20:19.790 --> 20:22.827
-He didn't want to tie you up, did he?
-No.

20:23.460 --> 20:24.529
No!

20:32.210 --> 20:36.453
You know what I remember about
the whole thing

20:37.540 --> 20:40.327
It wasn't the pain that sent him running.

20:40.750 --> 20:42.320
It was the mess.

20:42.920 --> 20:46.913
There's no record of your attack.
Police, hospital, nothing.

20:47.670 --> 20:49.319
Why didn't you come fonNard?

20:49.330 --> 20:54.415
I wasn't ready to kick it yet.
I was this close to dying for two weeks.

20:55.290 --> 20:58.202
And when I got back on my feet,
I realized...

20:58.210 --> 21:01.247
You just didn't want
to live like that anymore.

21:02.460 --> 21:05.668
If he hadn't attacked me, I would've OD'd.

21:07.750 --> 21:09.377
He saved my life.

21:15.460 --> 21:17.872
Our UnSub is a confident alpha male.

21:17.880 --> 21:20.952
He's white.
He's between the ages of 25 and 30.

21:21.250 --> 21:24.162
He's in excellent physical shape,
to overpower women,

21:24.170 --> 21:26.206
and also to feed his self-image.

21:26.210 --> 21:27.746
He has an obsession with cleaning.

21:27.750 --> 21:30.071
He probably works in some service industry

21:30.080 --> 21:33.868
wiping up after others, convinced
everyone looks down on him.

21:33.880 --> 21:37.532
His change in himself
and his victimology reflects that.

21:38.330 --> 21:40.616
This is the kind of guy
who wants to stand out in a crowd.

21:40.620 --> 21:42.872
_ He's taken a class
In how to pIck up women,

21:42.880 --> 21:46.498
so he'll repeat a series of
well-rehearsed lines and mind games.

21:46.500 --> 21:49.071
He may be uneducated,
but he's by no means stupid.

21:49.080 --> 21:50.877
Taking this class
has given him the ability

21:50.880 --> 21:53.110
to read verbal cues and body language.

21:53.120 --> 21:56.112
One classic routine the Viper promotes
is called the push-pull.

21:56.120 --> 21:58.281
He'll insert himself between two women

21:58.290 --> 22:00.246
and, immediately after complimenting one,

22:00.250 --> 22:03.458
he'll deliver a subtle insult,
then pay attention to the other.

22:03.460 --> 22:05.246
Those are really nice earrings.

22:05.250 --> 22:07.161
-I like those.
-Thanks.

22:07.620 --> 22:11.454
My grandmother wears
a lot of fake jewelry also. It looks nice.

22:11.460 --> 22:14.076
Ignoring the one woman puts her
in direct competition with her friend

22:14.080 --> 22:15.741
and causes the other _
to pursue you more aggressnvely.

22:15.750 --> 22:18.571
I was just demonstrating something, sorry.

22:18.580 --> 22:20.457
Well, we've mapped the hotspots he hits,

22:20.460 --> 22:22.451
and he frequents the same clubs
that the Viper does,

22:22.460 --> 22:24.872
so we need eyes and ears
in every single one.

22:24.880 --> 22:27.030
Circulate the sketch
as widely as possible.

22:27.040 --> 22:29.497
We need everyone aware
that there's a killer out there.

22:29.500 --> 22:31.240
Thank you very much.

22:32.880 --> 22:36.202
I think I might just stay home
and man the tip line tonight.

22:36.210 --> 22:37.325
Clubs aren't really my thing.

22:37.330 --> 22:39.707
Not a chance, kid. I need a wingman.
Come on now.

22:39.710 --> 22:42.452
Actually, there is another angle
we need to pursue.

22:42.460 --> 22:45.281
We still don't know what made
the UnSub change his victimology.

22:45.290 --> 22:48.202
What made him stop killing prostitutes
and move into the clubs.

22:48.210 --> 22:51.111
The answer might be
something in Viper's class,

22:51.120 --> 22:54.533
but to figure that out,
we need to profile the teacher.

22:54.540 --> 22:57.111
You need to bait him then,
with someone he sees as a challenge.

22:57.120 --> 22:59.611
We need to study his style
up close and personal.

22:59.620 --> 23:03.033
It's gonna take someone
that he's already attracted to.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.377
Oh, this is really gonna suck.

23:17.170 --> 23:19.320
Prentiss? _
-Yeah, come on In.

23:20.380 --> 23:24.168
-Hey. I'm 10 minutes away.
-You're okay with this, right?

23:24.750 --> 23:29.119
Yeah, I'll be fine. Sadly, I've actually
dated people worse than Viper.

23:30.580 --> 23:31.660
Wow.

23:33.420 --> 23:35.820
Is something going on with Jordan?

23:36.210 --> 23:40.783
You asked me to keep an eye on her,
and frankly, I've noticed some tension.

23:40.790 --> 23:42.451
I caught her in a lie.

23:42.460 --> 23:45.577
She _cut a corner _
to get us In WIth the Holden famIIy.

23:45.580 --> 23:49.243
-Did she misrepresent the Bureau?
-She misrepresented herself.

23:49.250 --> 23:50.285
Hmm.

23:50.790 --> 23:52.701
So how long
is she gonna be in the dog house?

23:52.710 --> 23:55.076
Until she proves she's competent.

23:55.960 --> 23:59.782
That's gonna be triclq
if you're scrutinizing her every move.

24:00.330 --> 24:01.877
Prentiss, you seemed to do okay.

24:04.790 --> 24:08.112
I think in order for Jordan
to prove she's good at this job,

24:08.120 --> 24:10.327
it's not gonna happen
under a magnifying glass.

24:10.330 --> 24:13.288
You're gonna have
to give her the opportunity.

24:13.790 --> 24:15.917
You have something in mind?

24:22.120 --> 24:24.372
When you think about
the nature of serial crimes,

24:24.380 --> 24:26.496
it's amazing there aren't more predators
in the clubs.

24:26.500 --> 24:27.990
I mean, excessive amounts of alcohol,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.286
countless opportunities
for date rape drugs,

24:30.290 --> 24:33.874
not to mention surprisingly
rislq behavior being pursued.

24:34.210 --> 24:38.533
All right, so who wants a flyer Okay. All right.

24:42.960 --> 24:44.075
So, how's it going?

24:44.080 --> 24:46.071
Not good. I gave the profile to one woman,

24:46.080 --> 24:47.707
she asked if I was the UnSub.

24:47.710 --> 24:50.110
-How are you doing?
-Well, I gave out all my flyers.

24:50.120 --> 24:51.747
How many phone numbers did you get?

24:51.750 --> 24:54.742
None. I'm working a case here, kid.

24:55.710 --> 24:59.168
Okay, four were offered,
but I didn't take any of them.

24:59.170 --> 25:01.240
All right, look,
let me school you real quick.

25:01.250 --> 25:05.994
What you have to do with these ladies,
just take control of the conversation.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.662
When you're talking,
what makes you feel like an expert?

25:08.670 --> 25:11.958
-Statistics. _
-No. Trust me, no. SomethIng else.

25:14.170 --> 25:16.661
-When I do magic.
-See, see, that's perfect.

25:16.670 --> 25:18.069
Chicks dig magic.

25:20.120 --> 25:23.328
I'm gonna give you a chance to work it.
Come here.

25:24.670 --> 25:25.785
Okay.

25:25.790 --> 25:28.998
Excuse me, sweetheart,
whenever you get a chance.

25:29.750 --> 25:33.413
-Hi. What can I get you?
-Hi, we're with the FBI.

25:33.420 --> 25:36.742
We're looking for this man.
Does he look at all familiar to you?

25:36.750 --> 25:38.570
That's not much of a picture.

25:38.580 --> 25:41.708
I know. You know what might help,
actually, is...

25:42.170 --> 25:45.458
He has a scar on his eye right
about there.

25:46.830 --> 25:50.743
We also know that he's taken classes
where he's learnt how to...

25:50.750 --> 25:55.915
Distract and charm his victim.

25:58.620 --> 26:02.738
-Okay, how'd you do that?
-That's privileged information.

26:03.620 --> 26:04.700
Huh.

26:07.120 --> 26:09.281
-So what do I do if I see him?
-You should call us.

26:09.290 --> 26:12.669
Even if you just think you see him,
you should definitely call us.

26:12.670 --> 26:16.379
And if I don't see him

26:18.460 --> 26:22.112
Yeah. Yeah, you could call me.
If you... Yeah.

26:22.120 --> 26:23.496
Okay. Cool.

26:23.920 --> 26:27.993
-Wait, I don't have your number.
-It's behind your barrette.

26:34.080 --> 26:35.160
Bye.

26:37.040 --> 26:40.953
See? There you go. That's what
I'm talking about. That's called game.

26:49.170 --> 26:51.161
That's an excellent question.

26:51.540 --> 26:55.078
Once you know a chick is interested,
how do you proceed?

27:00.170 --> 27:02.115
Allow me to demonstrate.

27:14.420 --> 27:16.376
This is a nice surprise.

27:16.920 --> 27:20.993
Well, the Atlanta PD. and the FBI
are combing all the bars you go to,

27:21.000 --> 27:23.491
and it looks like
I pulled the short straw.

27:23.500 --> 27:24.740
Luclq me, then.

27:25.920 --> 27:29.617
So, why do you do it?

27:31.500 --> 27:34.879
Why do you teach guys
how to be somebody they're not?

27:35.540 --> 27:38.111
Because it's a game. One I'm good at.

27:38.500 --> 27:41.708
And I want to help
other guys get good at it, too.

27:41.710 --> 27:46.204
So affection, sex,

27:47.000 --> 27:49.878
emotional commitment,
that's all just for fun, huh?

27:49.880 --> 27:53.668
No, the fun is in the initial spark.

27:54.250 --> 27:58.994
It's that thing a guy does in the first
five seconds that makes you go, "Him."

28:00.380 --> 28:03.110
What you're talking about
is a different beast.

28:03.120 --> 28:05.827
You can't fake it. You have to want it.

28:08.420 --> 28:11.992
Now, why are you really here?

28:17.290 --> 28:20.874
Is this the guy you were telling me about?

28:22.040 --> 28:25.578
Viper, meet SSA Jordan Todd from the BAU.

28:25.580 --> 28:27.957
Jordan, this is Viper,
God's gift to women.

28:28.790 --> 28:32.328
Wow. God sure has a sense of humor.

28:34.170 --> 28:36.161
You brought a friend.

28:36.170 --> 28:40.072
You promised if I met you on your turf,
you'd show me something special.

28:40.080 --> 28:42.162
So, let's see it.

28:42.670 --> 28:46.242
Yeah, Viper. Who gets pushed
and who gets pulled tonight?

28:51.380 --> 28:53.780
_ Is this the_ one
that If you stare at It long enough,

28:53.790 --> 28:55.781
you see the image of a swan?

28:55.790 --> 28:58.202
I'm just wondering
if we missed anything.

28:58.500 --> 29:02.493
Remember I said there was _
a secondary trIgger? We never found It.

29:04.080 --> 29:06.617
Maybe it's something that came
from the class. Prentiss could still...

29:06.620 --> 29:10.329
What he took from the class
brought him to Vanessa Holden,

29:10.330 --> 29:14.209
but I'm talking about something
much deeper, psychologically.

29:15.330 --> 29:16.786
Think about this.

29:16.790 --> 29:20.419
This UnSub always goes
to his victims' apartments.

29:20.920 --> 29:23.320
Never his own place. Why is that?

29:24.330 --> 29:26.707
Well, there must be
some restriction there.

29:26.710 --> 29:29.668
A nagging girlfriend.
A crying baby, maybe.

29:30.080 --> 29:33.709
Some reminder _ _
of how mIserable hIs Me Is.

29:33.710 --> 29:35.416
Which he's taking out on his victims.

29:37.120 --> 29:41.375
You see,
eye contact is a very powerful gauge.

29:42.620 --> 29:44.997
That's why you tend to look away
from someone you're attracted to,

29:45.000 --> 29:48.913
because you know instinctively
what a dead giveaway it is,

29:49.290 --> 29:51.781
but your brain goes there anyway.

29:51.790 --> 29:57.114
-Images, fantasies...
-Don't flatter yourself.

29:57.460 --> 30:00.111
The eyes don't lie. They dilate.

30:00.120 --> 30:02.076
It's a chemical response we can't control.

30:02.580 --> 30:05.322
-Okay, 15 seconds.
-What do you see?

30:05.330 --> 30:09.619
-Nope. No change. No dilation.
-I guess chemically we're not a match.

30:10.420 --> 30:12.661
Only because you have someone else
on the mind.

30:12.670 --> 30:16.743
Once that happens, the attraction
center in the brain shuts down.

30:18.040 --> 30:19.576
-Your turn.
-No.

30:22.670 --> 30:24.991
Are you scared I might be right?

30:26.670 --> 30:28.786
No, Paul. I'm baffled.

30:29.170 --> 30:32.207
I cannot figure out what the UnSub
could have learnt from you.

30:32.210 --> 30:35.077
What do you mean?
He took my look, my words.

30:35.540 --> 30:38.077
Everything that makes me successful
to the opposite sex.

30:38.080 --> 30:41.914
Really? Because that guy could get
beautiful women into his apartment.

30:41.920 --> 30:43.490
I wouldn't let you on my Facebook page.

30:43.500 --> 30:44.660
Oh, you're on Facebook?

30:44.670 --> 30:46.535
-Yeah. You should friend me.
-I will.

30:46.540 --> 30:51.614
Hey. Hey, hey. I gave him the routines
that made him what he is.

30:52.420 --> 30:54.206
It must all be in the salesmanship, then.

30:54.210 --> 30:56.531
'Cause we've been watching
all the women in the club...

30:56.540 --> 30:58.826
And not one of them has looked at you.

30:58.830 --> 31:01.412
So who do you really go home with, Paul?

31:01.420 --> 31:03.615
Or... Or do you go home alone?

31:11.000 --> 31:14.288
That was really good, ladies.
That was really good.

31:14.290 --> 31:16.872
Don't you think I know why you're here?

31:16.880 --> 31:21.533
One of my students copies my moves,
and you're here to get inside my mind.

31:22.880 --> 31:26.281
Don't you see? I confronted
my queen bee a long time ago.

31:26.290 --> 31:28.451
-What's a queen bee?
-You are.

31:28.880 --> 31:33.499
And so is every other confident girl
in here who's loud when she's drunk.

31:33.500 --> 31:36.458
The social butterfly. The alpha female.

31:36.920 --> 31:40.492
Every student who's ever taken
my class has had one in his life,

31:40.500 --> 31:43.412
and the first exercise
my students have to complete

31:43.420 --> 31:45.661
is to confront their queen bee.

31:46.120 --> 31:50.409
It could be the girl who cheated on you,
or the prom date who stood you up,

31:50.420 --> 31:53.617
but you find them and squash them.

32:01.080 --> 32:04.117
-Our UnSub knew Vanessa Holden.
-How do you know?

32:04.120 --> 32:06.782
It's Viper's
first confidence-building exercise.

32:06.790 --> 32:09.247
Find the source of your first rejection
and make her pay for it.

32:09.250 --> 32:10.615
That's why he stopped seeing prostitutes.

32:10.620 --> 32:13.919
He took Viper's class and decided
to confront Vanessa Holden.

32:13.920 --> 32:16.741
It makes sense with what he said
to Vanessa that night.

32:16.750 --> 32:18.706
"Don't you know who I am? Look closer."

32:18.710 --> 32:21.952
He meant it literally.
We need to talk to the family again.

32:24.170 --> 32:28.322
So what you're saying is that
you think my daughter knew her killer?

32:28.330 --> 32:31.538
It would have been someone
that she pOSS|b|y met at a young age.

32:31.540 --> 32:34.247
Maybe a boyfriend. Someone she rejected.

32:34.710 --> 32:36.871
No, Vanessa told me
about all her boyfriends.

32:36.880 --> 32:40.532
How about someone who expressed
himself sexually to Vanessa?

32:40.540 --> 32:43.202
It would have been awkward, embarrassing.

32:43.210 --> 32:46.828
And he would have had issues
WIth cleanIIness or cleanIng.

32:48.880 --> 32:50.245
What is it?

32:51.120 --> 32:53.998
That woman who used to clean for us.
The one who brought her son.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.787
-Who was she?
-I don't remember her name.

32:56.790 --> 32:58.701
There've been so many people
through this house.

32:58.710 --> 33:03.534
But I remember when she brought
this young boy, and he was odd.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.036
-How? _
-He was InapproprIate.

33:06.040 --> 33:09.578
He would hide in the closet
and then watch.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.740
I caught him one day with Vanessa.

33:14.580 --> 33:16.161
What are you doing in here?

33:16.170 --> 33:18.821
We... We weren't...
We weren't doing anything.

33:18.830 --> 33:21.287
-He made me.
-You are comIng WIth me.

33:21.290 --> 33:22.746
Get over here.

33:26.580 --> 33:28.207
What did you do?

33:29.380 --> 33:31.496
I did what any parent would do.

33:33.120 --> 33:36.704
Do you understand what you did

33:37.830 --> 33:40.822
The help... Doesn't...

33:40.830 --> 33:44.618
Mess... With this... Family.

33:45.580 --> 33:48.822
Don't you ever do that again.
Don't you ever!

33:53.540 --> 33:54.609
Mom!

33:55.420 --> 33:59.572
Don't "Mom" me. That boy had
no sense of boundaries whatsoever.

33:59.580 --> 34:01.957
He needed to be taught a lesson.

34:02.330 --> 34:05.663
Do you happen to have any records
of the employee

34:05.670 --> 34:07.706
No. Everyone got paid in cash.

34:07.710 --> 34:12.704
Bobby. His name was Bobby.
Vanessa called him a pervert.

34:12.960 --> 34:15.781
I fired the mother that day. It was awful.

34:16.460 --> 34:20.829
But there's a service that I remember
that I used to get my domestIcs from.

34:20.830 --> 34:22.957
It was in Fulton County.

34:26.000 --> 34:29.492
Last call, people! Last call.

34:30.790 --> 34:33.031
But you see, your love line's broken up,

34:33.040 --> 34:36.168
which means
you haven't found your soul mate yet.

34:36.620 --> 34:39.612
-Well, that's true.
-Yeah. It's really amazing, you...

34:39.620 --> 34:42.748
You see it in these couples
that are together forever.

34:42.750 --> 34:45.571
The lines on their palms change,

34:46.330 --> 34:49.379
so they become mirror images
of each other.

34:50.040 --> 34:51.667
-Rea|ly?
-Rea|ly.

34:54.040 --> 34:56.782
Why don't we...
Why don't we get out of here?

34:56.790 --> 34:58.997
I can tell you more about it.

35:00.500 --> 35:03.116
-Hey, what the hell?
-I'm sorry.

35:05.500 --> 35:07.570
Hey, you're holding on to me
kind of tight.

35:07.580 --> 35:09.241
We're leaving.

35:10.040 --> 35:14.818
You know what? I have some club soda
in the back, if you want to clean that up.

35:15.830 --> 35:18.617
Yeah. Yeah, why don't you let me do that?

35:23.380 --> 35:25.200
Just right back here.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.458
-I need you to stay right here, okay

35:41.710 --> 35:43.917
Come on, come on, come on.

35:51.960 --> 35:53.416
The bouncer saw Austin go out the back.

35:53.420 --> 35:54.990
She likes to smoke back here.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.490
Well, based on the witness' description,

35:56.500 --> 35:58.456
it definitely sounds
like the UnSub was here.

35:58.460 --> 36:00.280
We've got unis at her apartment,
but no one's home.

36:00.290 --> 36:02.781
-Hey, it's Austin, leave a message.-It's going straight to voicemail.

36:02.790 --> 36:04.746
Maybe we can have Garcia
try to triangulate where she is

36:04.750 --> 36:05.876
based on the cell phone...

36:13.580 --> 36:14.911
He has her.

36:17.790 --> 36:21.783
When you asked him if he practices
his routine on his sex doll...

36:22.960 --> 36:24.575
I almost lost it.

36:25.500 --> 36:28.287
You know, as much as I hate
what that guy stands for,

36:28.290 --> 36:32.659
I still read "Five Ways to Get Noticed"
in Cosmo magazine.

36:33.120 --> 36:35.372
That's because it makes sense.

36:37.120 --> 36:41.113
-Emily, thanks for doing this.
-Absolutely.

36:42.790 --> 36:46.703
I need you both out here.
The UnSub's kidnapped another victim.

36:48.460 --> 36:50.917
Garcia, you've got
Viper's attendance records?

36:50.920 --> 36:52.740
Got it. I am ready to play the player.

36:52.750 --> 36:56.618
Start with Robert. Narrow down
the permutations. Bob, Bobby.

36:57.210 --> 36:59.576
That gives us 23 suspects.

36:59.580 --> 37:01.491
-Do you have access to birth records?-Yeah.

37:01.500 --> 37:03.616
Pull the mothers' names
and cross-reference WIth work

37:03.620 --> 37:06.703
-and home addresses in Fulton County.
-Hold on.

37:07.290 --> 37:10.748
Bingo. Robert C. Parker.
Lives at 932 Pryor Street.

37:11.250 --> 37:12.820
Pryor's five miles from here.

37:12.830 --> 37:15.071
Let's go.
Jordan, have SWAT meet us at the site.

37:29.540 --> 37:32.919
You made a mess,
and now you're gonna clean it up.

37:39.620 --> 37:45.206
Clean it up! Clean it up! Clean it up!

37:45.960 --> 37:48.531
Clean! Clean it up!

37:51.000 --> 37:55.494
Faster. Faster. What'd I say? Faster.

38:04.500 --> 38:05.615
First team in position.

38:06.080 --> 38:12.110
I'll do whatever it is you want me to do.
I'll do it. I'll do it. Okay?

38:14.540 --> 38:18.374
The help doesn't talk.

38:35.210 --> 38:36.245
FBI!

38:39.290 --> 38:41.076
Stay down! Stay down!

38:43.040 --> 38:47.283
-Get this off. Get it off. Get it off.
-It's okay. You're okay.

38:47.290 --> 38:50.999
-I called you. I called you. I called you.
-I know, I know.

38:53.580 --> 38:54.877
Let's go.

38:55.880 --> 38:59.111
Please. Please, please.

39:03.880 --> 39:07.998
Who's that

39:18.960 --> 39:21.246
Who are you

39:21.750 --> 39:26.289
-Mrs. Parker Where's my son?

39:26.750 --> 39:29.241
Everything's gonna be okay.
We're gonna get you some help.

39:29.250 --> 39:35.200
No, please. I need Robert.
I need to be changed.

-He's just outside, ma'am.
-It's a dialysis pump.

39:40.920 --> 39:47.109
It was issued 10 months ago.
We found our secondary trigger.

40:00.250 --> 40:01.456
Come in.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.877
-My report.
-Thank you.

40:05.960 --> 40:07.166
Jordan.

40:08.460 --> 40:11.611
Prentiss said you were excellent
in the field.

40:11.620 --> 40:14.032
Astute, responsive.
You thought well on your feet.

40:14.040 --> 40:16.452
She's being generous.
I really enjoyed working with her.

40:16.460 --> 40:18.200
You also posited early on

40:18.210 --> 40:20.701
that Vanessa Holden might know the UnSub.

40:20.710 --> 40:24.032
Well, he didn't fit the profile
of a sexual sadist.

40:24.040 --> 40:28.989
And you were right. Clearly our UnSub
was more complicated than the profile.

40:29.790 --> 40:34.079
Anyway, I just wanted you to know
that you have the green light again.

40:34.540 --> 40:37.168
-And I trust your judgment.
-Thank you.

40:45.420 --> 40:47.570
Great.

40:47.830 --> 40:50.037
I told my HMO
I got abducted by a serial killer,

40:50.040 --> 40:52.031
so they gave me free dental X-rays.

40:52.420 --> 40:56.538
Well, I'm glad your stay at the hospital
wasn't too terrible, then.

40:56.540 --> 40:59.247
Yeah. My doctor gave me
a clean bill of health.

40:59.250 --> 41:01.707
Told me I could even go back to work
ifI wanted to.

41:01.710 --> 41:03.917
-Hey, back to bartending. All right.
-Sir.

41:03.920 --> 41:05.990
No, I quit that job.

41:06.540 --> 41:08.246
My recent brush with death

41:08.250 --> 41:10.787
has inspired me
to pursue a different career.

41:11.290 --> 41:15.169
Well, that's very exciting news.
What is the new job path?

41:16.000 --> 41:19.163
Well, I was thinking about
taking up magic.

41:20.500 --> 41:22.877
Have you opened the package yet?

41:24.290 --> 41:25.746
What is this?

41:33.460 --> 41:37.954
-Is this your card?
-Yeah. It is my card.

41:40.040 --> 41:41.166
Cool.
