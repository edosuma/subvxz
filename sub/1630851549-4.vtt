00:08.456 --> 00:11.494
You got any big plans
for Halloween?
Of course.

00:11.528 --> 00:13.703
My boyfriend and I have
costumes planned for each night.

00:13.737 --> 00:15.222
Each night?

00:15.256 --> 00:18.328
Don't tell me you've never
heard of Hallo-weekend?

00:18.363 --> 00:19.467
I can't say that I have.

00:19.502 --> 00:20.779
Halloween is basically

00:20.813 --> 00:21.952
a week-long celebration
these days.

00:21.987 --> 00:23.540
That sounds excessive.

00:26.716 --> 00:28.752
Pull over.

00:37.313 --> 00:39.142
Everything all right
here, guys?

00:39.177 --> 00:41.834
Yeah, Sarge, we're fine.

00:41.869 --> 00:43.560
I'm just trying to keep
my buddy here from driving home.

00:43.595 --> 00:44.975
Where are you taking him?

00:47.978 --> 00:49.773
Maybe you should take him
home instead of to a bar.

00:49.808 --> 00:53.018
My name's Kyle Dorsey.
I work out of the 5-6.

00:53.053 --> 00:55.986
This is Mark Adams.
He works out of the 2-1.

00:56.021 --> 00:57.678
Look, if I take him home
in this condition,

00:57.712 --> 00:59.680
his wife's gonna
kill us both.

00:59.714 --> 01:01.406
Yeah, well, as a cop,
he should know better.

01:01.440 --> 01:03.960
He's obviously unfit for duty.

01:03.994 --> 01:06.411
But if you've got
everything under control,

01:06.445 --> 01:07.412
we'll be on our way.

01:07.446 --> 01:09.138
Come on.
Let's go.

01:09.172 --> 01:10.587
Sarge.

01:14.522 --> 01:16.110
Hey, Kyle.

01:17.146 --> 01:18.216
Did you see this?

01:19.286 --> 01:21.357
It looks like your friend
was in an accident.

01:21.391 --> 01:23.290
Come on, man.

01:23.324 --> 01:24.843
Well, this changes everything.
I'm gonna put it over the air

01:24.877 --> 01:26.189
and see what he might've hit.

01:26.224 --> 01:28.364
- Really, dude?
- And that's "Sergeant" to you.

01:28.398 --> 01:30.297
Oh, what the hell, man?
- You said you'd help me out!
- Sergeant to Central.

01:38.305 --> 01:39.616
Hands behind your back.

01:39.651 --> 01:41.135
Let me handle him.

01:41.170 --> 01:43.655
Yeah, 'cause you're doing
such a great job.

01:43.689 --> 01:45.795
Hands behind your back.

01:52.319 --> 01:53.561
What is with the costumes?

01:53.596 --> 01:55.115
Halloween isn't till Sunday.

01:55.149 --> 01:56.806
How can you tell
these are costumes?

01:56.840 --> 01:58.842
That's my problem with
Halloween in New York.

01:58.877 --> 02:00.982
You can never tell if
people are dressed up

02:01.017 --> 02:03.640
or they're just
dressed like that.

02:03.675 --> 02:06.609
Give it to me!
It's my money, too.

02:06.643 --> 02:08.542
Hey!
- Give it to me!

02:08.576 --> 02:09.784
- Hey!
- Give it to me.

02:09.819 --> 02:12.925
Hey! Get off her.

02:12.960 --> 02:14.617
- Are you okay?
- Get the hell away from me.

02:14.651 --> 02:16.101
Put your hands
behind your back.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.378
We're here to help.
Do you want an ambulance?

02:17.413 --> 02:18.724
I don't talk to cops.

02:18.759 --> 02:20.692
Please, you're bleeding
from your head...

02:23.177 --> 02:24.696
Are you deaf, bitch?

02:24.730 --> 02:26.180
I don't want your help.

02:28.665 --> 02:31.012
Come on.

02:32.013 --> 02:34.361
You gonna arrest me? Really?

02:34.395 --> 02:36.949
No, I'm getting you help,
whether you like it or not.

02:38.675 --> 02:41.195
29-David, I need a bus.
Tenth and 44th.

02:44.233 --> 02:46.131
Can you believe
this is a high school?

02:46.166 --> 02:49.583
No. Looks more like
Shawshank prison to me.

02:49.617 --> 02:50.860
It's amazing what
people will spend

02:50.894 --> 02:52.448
60 grand a year on these days.

02:52.482 --> 02:54.001
It gives me the creeps.

02:54.035 --> 02:55.796
Me, too.

02:55.830 --> 02:57.211
Hey, Fucci,
what do we got?

02:57.246 --> 02:59.834
Vic is an 18-year-old
female, Kayla Johnson.

02:59.869 --> 03:01.629
DOA. No witnesses.

03:01.664 --> 03:03.183
No witnesses, huh?

03:03.217 --> 03:04.460
Any idea what happened?

03:04.494 --> 03:06.427
Another student found her
on the bathroom floor.

03:06.462 --> 03:08.257
Looks like a head injury.

03:08.291 --> 03:09.706
Any security cameras?

03:09.741 --> 03:11.432
They recently had them
all removed.

03:11.467 --> 03:13.745
Wow. Perfect timing.

03:23.133 --> 03:25.032
Something wrong
with my office?

03:25.066 --> 03:26.344
Right now?

03:26.378 --> 03:28.035
Yeah.

03:29.761 --> 03:32.246
Cell phone footage of an arrest

03:32.281 --> 03:33.282
from an hour ago.

03:35.491 --> 03:36.906
IAB has it.

03:36.940 --> 03:39.909
And here I am.

03:39.943 --> 03:42.049
So does the press.

03:44.845 --> 03:46.640
Shut up, you scumbag!

03:46.674 --> 03:49.401
- Track star!
- Take it easy. Take it easy!

03:49.436 --> 03:51.300
Come on...

03:53.025 --> 03:55.994
Hey, hey, hey, get that
out of here. Out! Ou--

04:02.000 --> 04:04.934
Media's agreed to hold off
on posting it

04:04.968 --> 04:07.281
until you give a comment.

04:09.318 --> 04:10.767
Brian Baker.

04:12.838 --> 04:15.082
I don't think Abigail knows.

04:16.946 --> 04:19.983
I was just with her.
I'm certain she does not.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.561
Mark was driving.

04:45.595 --> 04:47.977
He thought he hit something;
he called me asking for help.

04:48.011 --> 04:49.012
Any idea what he hit?

04:49.047 --> 04:50.117
He didn't say.

04:50.151 --> 04:53.500
And why not just take him home?

04:53.534 --> 04:55.502
'Cause of his wife. I told you.

04:55.536 --> 04:57.780
So plan B's always O'Rourke's.

04:58.712 --> 05:00.679
You don't know about O'Rourke's?

05:00.714 --> 05:01.956
What's to know?

05:01.991 --> 05:03.406
It's been a safe place

05:03.441 --> 05:05.339
for cops and firefighters
for generations.

05:05.374 --> 05:06.927
What's that mean, "safe place"?

05:06.961 --> 05:11.138
Okay, so, if a cop in the know
pulls over another cop

05:11.172 --> 05:12.933
or a red menace
that's been drinking,

05:12.967 --> 05:14.659
and the guy isn't an ass
and he didn't hurt anybody,

05:14.693 --> 05:17.489
take him to O'Rourke's
instead of jamming him up.

05:17.524 --> 05:19.146
The owner's a retired cop.

05:19.180 --> 05:20.423
Seriously?

05:20.458 --> 05:21.424
It's, like, the only place

05:21.459 --> 05:22.563
that our two departments

05:22.598 --> 05:23.875
get along
and help each other out.

05:23.909 --> 05:25.566
Shocked you haven't
heard of it.

05:25.601 --> 05:28.880
Unless they, uh, kept Reagans
out of the loop on purpose.

05:28.914 --> 05:31.848
Yeah, we're not, uh, big
on breaking the law, so... It's not

05:31.883 --> 05:33.298
breaking the law--
I'm just trying

05:33.333 --> 05:34.886
to not jam up a good guy.

05:34.920 --> 05:36.577
Good guys don't drive plastered
and then ask a fellow cop

05:36.612 --> 05:37.889
to bail them out.

05:37.923 --> 05:39.477
Wish you were more like
your sister.

05:39.511 --> 05:40.995
You must not know her very well

05:41.030 --> 05:42.514
if you think she'd let
something like this slide.

05:42.549 --> 05:44.067
We did a case together.
I was on loan

05:44.102 --> 05:45.862
to the D.A.'s office
for a few months.

05:45.897 --> 05:47.243
She knew how to
weigh a situation.

05:47.277 --> 05:48.865
Hey, I'm just doing
what you should've done.

05:48.900 --> 05:50.108
Wait, now you're trying
to jam me up?

05:50.142 --> 05:51.661
I'm not trying
to jam anybody up.

05:51.696 --> 05:53.076
I'm trying to figure out
what happened.

05:53.111 --> 05:55.458
Our job is to put the bad guys
behind bars,

05:55.493 --> 05:59.566
not to mess with somebody's life
when they make a little mistake.

06:02.189 --> 06:04.260
<i>And how long have you
been head of school here?</i>

06:04.294 --> 06:06.400
- This'll be my third year.
- But nothing like this

06:06.435 --> 06:07.677
has ever happened before?

06:07.712 --> 06:08.816
Not even close.

06:08.851 --> 06:10.404
Parents about lost their minds

06:10.439 --> 06:11.750
when I relaxed the dress code.

06:11.785 --> 06:13.752
I suspect they'll crucify me
for this.

06:13.787 --> 06:15.064
You recently removed

06:15.098 --> 06:16.790
[phone dings]the security cameras.

06:16.824 --> 06:21.035
My students felt that it was
an invasion of their privacy,

06:21.070 --> 06:22.451
and I agreed.

06:22.485 --> 06:24.280
- Felt they should be trusted.
- I mean, not
for nothing,

06:24.314 --> 06:26.006
these kids spend most
of their lives on social media.

06:26.040 --> 06:28.215
They don't seem too concerned
about their privacy.

06:28.249 --> 06:30.873
I'd argue by choice,
not school policy.

06:30.907 --> 06:32.219
Fair enough.
Is there

06:32.253 --> 06:33.427
a big drug problem here?

06:33.462 --> 06:35.464
I assume they're around,

06:35.498 --> 06:37.086
but since I've been
head of school,

06:37.120 --> 06:40.020
we haven't had to discipline
anyone for drug use.

06:40.054 --> 06:42.367
You keep a log of everyone who
entered the building today?

06:42.402 --> 06:44.645
We do, and I'm happy
to share it with you.

06:44.680 --> 06:46.129
But if you'll excuse me,
I'm needed upstairs.

06:46.164 --> 06:48.615
Mm-hmm. Uh, be in touch.

06:48.649 --> 06:50.617
Thank you.

06:50.651 --> 06:51.928
You got something?

06:51.963 --> 06:54.103
I got nothing.

06:58.728 --> 07:00.558
Hey, you want
to grab a bite?

07:00.592 --> 07:02.525
No, I'm not hungry.

07:03.353 --> 07:04.354
Coffee?

07:04.389 --> 07:05.528
I'd never get to sleep.

07:05.563 --> 07:07.185
How about a drink?

07:07.219 --> 07:09.152
I'd fall right to sleep.

07:10.533 --> 07:12.224
Well, hey, hey,

07:12.259 --> 07:15.883
do you want to maybe do
something this weekend?

07:15.918 --> 07:19.853
Maybe my friend and partner
could take a hint.

07:19.887 --> 07:22.096
I just thought
maybe you'd want to talk

07:22.131 --> 07:24.374
about what happened today--
I know I do.

07:24.409 --> 07:27.101
It's... what we signed up for.

07:28.586 --> 07:30.450
Can you just back off?

07:40.460 --> 07:42.358
Well, that's some radar.

07:42.392 --> 07:44.671
I was about to ask you in.

07:46.811 --> 07:49.607
Something's going on.

07:51.988 --> 07:53.818
Have you, uh,

07:53.852 --> 07:56.061
talked to your husband
since you got in?

07:56.096 --> 07:57.131
No.

07:57.166 --> 07:58.512
Call him.

07:58.547 --> 08:00.410
Is he okay?

08:00.445 --> 08:02.171
Oh, Brian's okay.

08:02.205 --> 08:04.311
But, uh...

08:04.345 --> 08:07.279
something happened on his tour.

08:07.314 --> 08:09.178
He crossed a line.

08:09.212 --> 08:11.939
It was caught on camera.

08:11.974 --> 08:13.354
Have you seen it?

08:13.389 --> 08:15.322
I have.

08:15.356 --> 08:17.669
But you know how these things
can be manipulated

08:17.704 --> 08:19.602
or taken out of context.

08:19.637 --> 08:22.087
Uh, not this one, Abigail.

08:22.122 --> 08:25.884
He roughed up a perp
in action and language.

08:25.919 --> 08:27.748
How do you rough up a perp
with language?

08:27.783 --> 08:30.648
"Greaseball." "Scumbag."

08:30.682 --> 08:32.201
That doesn't sound like Brian.

08:32.235 --> 08:34.030
It doesn't.

08:34.065 --> 08:38.310
Sid is on his way to review
the body cam footage, so...

08:38.345 --> 08:40.520
Gormley knows?

08:40.554 --> 08:42.107
Yes.

08:43.212 --> 08:46.077
This is why Garrett needed
to see you privately?

08:46.905 --> 08:49.390
The press brought it to Garrett.

08:49.425 --> 08:51.772
Sid was informed by IAB.

08:52.601 --> 08:54.603
The press has this?

08:54.637 --> 08:57.433
I'm afraid so.

08:57.467 --> 08:59.262
Where are your kids?

08:59.297 --> 09:00.712
At school. I...

09:01.541 --> 09:03.232
Take the day.

09:03.266 --> 09:05.648
It could just blow over.

09:06.476 --> 09:08.858
Take the day.

09:11.205 --> 09:12.690
This better be important,

09:12.724 --> 09:14.657
because I'm due in court
in an hour.

09:14.692 --> 09:16.486
You know a cop
named Kyle Dorsey?

09:16.521 --> 09:19.282
Yeah, Kyle was on loan to us
for a couple months.

09:19.317 --> 09:21.802
He actually helped us
with a really important case.

09:21.837 --> 09:23.355
Feel like you
owe him anything?

09:23.390 --> 09:24.943
No, I don't owe him
anything.

09:26.807 --> 09:28.878
Why are you asking about him?

09:28.913 --> 09:30.949
Well, I came upon him
helping out a fellow cop

09:30.984 --> 09:32.917
who was driving
while intoxicated.

09:32.951 --> 09:34.988
Any victims
or damage to property?

09:35.022 --> 09:37.231
I'm only aware of some damage
to the car.

09:37.266 --> 09:40.200
Did you see him driving drunk
and then pull him over?

09:40.234 --> 09:41.719
No.

09:41.753 --> 09:43.790
So how did you come to arrest
this guy for a DWI?

09:43.824 --> 09:45.826
Well, I collared him
for disorderly conduct,

09:45.861 --> 09:47.552
and I gave him
a command discipline

09:47.587 --> 09:48.864
for being unfit for duty.

09:48.898 --> 09:50.382
Wait, you're here for a summons?

09:50.417 --> 09:52.868
Dorsey was helping a buddy
avoid taking a collar

09:52.902 --> 09:55.422
for DWI, but the way that
he talks to me about it

09:55.456 --> 09:56.941
is really odd--
it's like he thinks

09:56.975 --> 09:58.563
he deserves a service medal
for it,

09:58.598 --> 09:59.875
or it was a heroic act.

09:59.909 --> 10:02.118
But the bar that
he was taking his buddy to

10:02.153 --> 10:04.983
apparently is like some
safe house where cops

10:05.018 --> 10:08.262
and FDNY go
to cover each other's asses.

10:08.297 --> 10:10.299
What's the name of the bar?

10:10.333 --> 10:12.059
O'Rourke's. Up in the Heights.

10:12.094 --> 10:15.304
Apparently it's been sanctuary
for, like, years.

10:15.338 --> 10:17.030
That's above my pay grade.

10:17.064 --> 10:19.066
Will you ask Anthony
what he knows?

10:26.487 --> 10:30.319
As expected, Kayla did die
from a traumatic brain injury.

10:30.353 --> 10:31.872
Her head injuries are consistent

10:31.907 --> 10:33.633
with hitting her head
on the radiator.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.462
And the bruises on her arm?

10:35.496 --> 10:37.671
Yes, there are signs
of a struggle.

10:37.706 --> 10:39.880
Anything other than the
bruising on her arms?

10:39.915 --> 10:41.744
Chunks of her hair
were pulled out.

10:41.779 --> 10:43.090
So it was a homicide.

10:43.125 --> 10:43.953
Cause undetermined

10:43.988 --> 10:45.714
pending police investigation.

10:45.748 --> 10:47.577
bruising on her arms,

10:47.612 --> 10:49.407
chunks of hair pulled
from her head,

10:49.441 --> 10:50.822
consistent with a struggle.

10:50.857 --> 10:53.031
I'd say it was
one hell of a struggle.

10:53.066 --> 10:54.895
She could have pulled
her hair out herself

10:54.930 --> 10:57.415
or obtained these bruises
earlier in the day.

10:57.449 --> 10:58.519
You don't really

10:58.554 --> 10:59.935
believe that, do you?

10:59.969 --> 11:01.212
Come on, Danny,

11:01.246 --> 11:03.076
you know that
I have to do things by the book.

11:03.110 --> 11:04.940
It is your job
to prove if these things

11:04.974 --> 11:06.700
have anything to do
with her death.

11:06.735 --> 11:09.358
Okay. Then we'll prove it.

11:10.152 --> 11:12.050
There's something else
that you should know.

11:14.294 --> 11:16.572
Kayla was four months pregnant.

11:30.344 --> 11:35.108
I sacrificed so much
to send Kayla to that school.

11:35.142 --> 11:38.318
Spent a fortune to keep her away
from the...

11:38.352 --> 11:40.630
sex and the drugs

11:40.665 --> 11:43.357
that public schools
traffic in.

11:43.392 --> 11:45.670
And for what?

11:46.498 --> 11:50.813
Mrs. Johnson, we have
something else to tell you.

11:50.848 --> 11:53.471
What could be worse
than what I already know?

11:53.505 --> 11:55.818
Uh...

11:55.853 --> 11:58.890
Kayla was
four months pregnant.

12:00.409 --> 12:01.859
Oh, God.

12:01.893 --> 12:04.654
Do you have any idea
who the father may have been?

12:04.689 --> 12:06.829
The father?

12:06.864 --> 12:08.175
Was she seeing someone?

12:08.210 --> 12:09.245
No.

12:09.280 --> 12:12.283
Um, yes. Uh...

12:12.317 --> 12:14.388
uh, but not anymore.

12:14.423 --> 12:15.458
What was his name?

12:15.493 --> 12:17.081
Noah Barber.

12:18.116 --> 12:20.222
Rich white kid. No offense.

12:20.256 --> 12:21.775
No offense taken.

12:21.810 --> 12:23.915
Do you know
why she stopped seeing him?

12:23.950 --> 12:27.160
Noah is a few years older.

12:28.713 --> 12:30.819
He was held back, and...

12:30.853 --> 12:33.822
took a gap year
to travel Europe.

12:35.340 --> 12:37.826
It all impressed her.

12:37.860 --> 12:40.035
I told her to cut it off.

12:40.069 --> 12:42.416
Why did you feel a need
to tell her that?

12:42.451 --> 12:45.626
He was too mature for her.

12:45.661 --> 12:47.836
And I found
these crazy love letters

12:47.870 --> 12:51.632
in her room, talking
about running off and...

12:51.667 --> 12:53.565
giving her a better life.

12:53.600 --> 12:58.329
I don't know of many teenagers
writing love letters nowadays.

12:58.363 --> 12:59.744
He isn't a normal teenager.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.815
More money than he knew
what to do with.

13:01.850 --> 13:03.299
He actually had

13:03.334 --> 13:06.164
the means to take her away
from me if he wanted.

13:06.199 --> 13:07.717
We'll find out
if he was there yesterday,

13:07.752 --> 13:08.788
and we'll go from there.

13:08.822 --> 13:11.135
He was expelled a month ago

13:11.169 --> 13:14.690
for posting a racist video
on TikTok

13:14.724 --> 13:16.519
- or whatever.
- He still

13:16.554 --> 13:17.866
could have gotten
into the school.

13:17.900 --> 13:20.834
Rich white boys
can get in anywhere...

13:20.869 --> 13:23.112
and do whatever they want there.

13:24.907 --> 13:27.565
Believe me, you do not want
to know about O'Rourke's.

13:27.599 --> 13:28.980
I already know about O'Rourke's.

13:29.015 --> 13:30.568
No, you don't,
or you wouldn't have asked me.

13:30.602 --> 13:32.915
Okay, why don't I want to know?

13:32.950 --> 13:34.848
- I just told you.
- Told me what?

13:34.883 --> 13:36.781
Forget that you heard about it.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.818
Well, I don't like
the sound of that.

13:38.852 --> 13:40.129
Change the station, then.

13:44.789 --> 13:46.480
Kyle Dorsey.

13:46.515 --> 13:48.862
Tune to another station.

13:48.897 --> 13:50.105
Jamie came upon him

13:50.139 --> 13:52.279
helping a drunk pal
into O'Rourke's.

13:52.314 --> 13:54.557
Damage to the car,
but there was no reports

13:54.592 --> 13:56.421
of a hit-and-run in the area.

13:56.456 --> 13:57.491
I got nothing.

13:57.526 --> 13:58.527
You worked with Dorsey

13:58.561 --> 14:00.115
when he was up here, right?

14:00.149 --> 14:01.047
Yes, I did.

14:01.081 --> 14:02.427
Okay.

14:02.462 --> 14:04.188
Good cop?

14:06.880 --> 14:09.469
I axed you a question.

14:09.503 --> 14:10.884
Axed?

14:10.919 --> 14:12.334
Yeah.

14:12.368 --> 14:13.853
Stop stonewalling me.

14:16.717 --> 14:19.962
Dorsey's a gung-ho true blue.

14:20.894 --> 14:22.723
Too gung-ho, maybe.

14:22.758 --> 14:24.104
Dorsey's, uh,

14:24.139 --> 14:28.384
one of those cops thinks
the job is to...

14:28.419 --> 14:31.111
look out for other cops...

14:31.146 --> 14:35.012
instead of, you know, citizens.

14:38.429 --> 14:40.086
Work with Jamie on this.

14:40.120 --> 14:43.744
Just find out
what actually happened.

14:45.781 --> 14:47.956
It's okay. She went home.

14:50.130 --> 14:53.099
I reviewed Officer Baker's
body cam footage,

14:53.133 --> 14:55.895
and it seems
the video circulating

14:55.929 --> 14:58.449
gives an accurate depiction
of what transpired.

14:58.483 --> 15:00.347
That's what I was afraid of.

15:00.382 --> 15:03.316
Even his partner told IAB
that he behaved irrationally,

15:03.350 --> 15:05.559
lost his temper and
needed to be disciplined.

15:05.594 --> 15:07.389
I mean, his own partner.

15:07.423 --> 15:08.631
What's the verdict?

15:08.666 --> 15:10.357
IAB is gonna suspend him
without pay

15:10.392 --> 15:13.291
pending the outcome
of their investigation.

15:14.706 --> 15:16.950
Okay.

15:18.434 --> 15:20.367
You're gonna have to put out
a statement.

15:21.161 --> 15:23.923
Condemning Officer Baker's actions.

15:24.958 --> 15:28.168
Yes.

15:28.962 --> 15:30.584
I'll draft something up.

15:30.619 --> 15:32.448
You thinking

15:32.483 --> 15:33.691
what I'm thinking?

15:33.725 --> 15:34.968
Guy's got a spotless record.

15:35.003 --> 15:36.349
Where'd this come from?

15:36.383 --> 15:38.592
His CO said
he just hasn't been the same

15:38.627 --> 15:40.836
since he'd been shot
two years ago.

15:40.870 --> 15:44.150
I mean, nothing this
bad has ever happened,

15:44.184 --> 15:48.361
but he did say Brian was like
a trigger without a safety.

15:48.395 --> 15:50.156
And the CO did nothing?

15:50.190 --> 15:52.330
Said he gave him
the benefit of the doubt.

15:52.365 --> 15:53.987
Said he felt for Brian.

15:54.022 --> 15:56.817
And look where that got us.

15:58.923 --> 16:01.995
Oh, there's that
new smoothie place.

16:02.030 --> 16:03.583
McGovern said
we should try

16:03.617 --> 16:05.412
the Peach on the Beach.

16:05.447 --> 16:06.896
And you love peaches

16:06.931 --> 16:09.899
and you love the beach,
so what's not to like?

16:11.729 --> 16:13.765
You want to listen to the radio?

16:14.594 --> 16:17.873
Okay, I'm gonna take that as
a "Yes, Eddie, I love music."

16:17.907 --> 16:20.048
Could you please not?

16:20.082 --> 16:23.085
Well, you've been giving me
the silent treatment all day.

16:23.120 --> 16:25.501
Yeah, maybe you
could take a cue.

16:25.536 --> 16:26.916
I got to talk to somebody.

16:26.951 --> 16:28.504
If I'm not gonna
talk to you,

16:28.539 --> 16:29.954
I'm gonna talk
to myself.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.783
And you think I'm the crazy one?

16:31.818 --> 16:33.578
Whoa. I never said
you were crazy.

16:33.613 --> 16:34.786
You implied it.

16:34.821 --> 16:36.926
No, I didn't.

16:36.961 --> 16:38.998
I said I wanted
to talk to you

16:39.032 --> 16:40.585
about what happened
at the park.

16:40.620 --> 16:42.622
Yeah, and I want to forget
it ever happened.

16:42.656 --> 16:45.004
So, what?
Are you just gonna mope around

16:45.038 --> 16:47.040
in silence
for the rest of your life?

16:47.075 --> 16:49.456
You're not gonna get me
out of this mood,

16:49.491 --> 16:51.631
no matter how hard you try.

16:54.875 --> 16:56.877
So you're gonna wallow?

16:56.912 --> 16:58.672
No, I'm gonna own it.

17:00.260 --> 17:03.160
If it's bothering you
this much, then...

17:03.194 --> 17:06.197
maybe you should look
into getting a new partner.

17:10.615 --> 17:11.927
Where were you
yesterday morning

17:11.961 --> 17:14.171
between the hours
of 8:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m.?

17:14.205 --> 17:16.035
You actually think
I'd invite you into my house

17:16.069 --> 17:17.933
if I had anything to do
with her murder?

17:17.967 --> 17:19.348
Who said it was a murder?

17:19.383 --> 17:20.798
That's what everyone's saying.

17:20.832 --> 17:22.075
- Hmm.
- Look,

17:22.110 --> 17:23.801
I was playing squash
at the U Club.

17:23.835 --> 17:25.078
Plenty of people saw me.

17:25.113 --> 17:27.046
We'll need a list of names.

17:27.080 --> 17:28.840
Do I need a lawyer present?

17:28.875 --> 17:30.635
Do you have anything to hide?

17:30.670 --> 17:32.430
Am I missing something? Hmm?

17:32.465 --> 17:34.018
Why would I want Kayla dead?

17:34.053 --> 17:36.193
Maybe you aren't ready
to be a father.

17:36.227 --> 17:37.780
A what?

17:37.815 --> 17:41.094
A father.
She was four months pregnant.

17:41.129 --> 17:42.578
No, that's...

17:42.613 --> 17:44.994
that's, uh, that's not possible.

17:45.029 --> 17:47.859
Y-You think I'm dumb enough
not to wrap it up?

17:47.894 --> 17:49.827
So you're willing to take
a paternity test?

17:49.861 --> 17:51.139
Happy to.
If you're not

17:51.173 --> 17:53.210
the father,
who do you suspect might be?

17:53.244 --> 17:54.590
Some other guy?

17:54.625 --> 17:56.834
I'm not saying
anything else.

17:56.868 --> 17:58.629
You guys will just,
you'll just twist it around

17:58.663 --> 17:59.975
and make me look bad.

18:00.009 --> 18:01.701
I listen to a lot
of true crime podcasts.

18:01.735 --> 18:02.909
I know how this goes.

18:02.943 --> 18:03.806
Wow.

18:03.841 --> 18:05.153
Well, they say
a little knowledge

18:05.187 --> 18:06.947
is a dangerous thing--
you ever hear that

18:06.982 --> 18:08.915
on your true crime podcasts?

18:09.743 --> 18:14.127
If you want to know who else
was involved in Kayla's life,

18:14.162 --> 18:16.957
why don't you ask her mentor,
Mr. Anderson?

18:16.992 --> 18:18.338
The head of school?

18:18.373 --> 18:20.064
Kayla treated him like a god.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.204
Told that loser everything.
He was way too involved

18:22.239 --> 18:23.412
in her life.

18:23.447 --> 18:24.793
He didn't mention that.

18:24.827 --> 18:26.277
Why would he?

18:26.312 --> 18:27.761
That dude crosses so many lines.

18:27.796 --> 18:29.280
He even got me
kicked out of school

18:29.315 --> 18:30.730
to keep me away from her.

18:30.764 --> 18:32.145
Interesting you blame him,

18:32.180 --> 18:33.526
since you were
thrown out of school

18:33.560 --> 18:34.975
because of a racist video.

18:35.010 --> 18:37.737
My girlfriend was Black!
I'm clearly not racist!

18:37.771 --> 18:39.118
Why'd you leave school, then?

18:39.152 --> 18:40.947
Well, Mr. Anderson
said that my presence

18:40.981 --> 18:42.707
made the other students
feel uncomfortable.

18:42.742 --> 18:44.192
So you just left?

18:44.226 --> 18:45.952
You're so innocent,

18:45.986 --> 18:47.643
- you didn't even put up a fight?
- How?

18:47.678 --> 18:48.920
Say I sue the school.

18:48.955 --> 18:50.577
Then the rest of my life
I am labeled

18:50.612 --> 18:53.994
as the "rich white boy who
claimed reverse discrimination."

19:00.208 --> 19:03.072
Paternity test shows
Noah is not the father.

19:03.107 --> 19:06.317
And I've got six witnesses
who confirmed his alibi,

19:06.352 --> 19:08.250
though it sounds like his squash
game needs a little bit of work.

19:08.285 --> 19:12.496
Well, he also told the truth
about the racist TikTok video.

19:12.530 --> 19:14.601
All he did was
impersonate Eminem.

19:14.636 --> 19:16.051
What, like in blackface
or something?

19:16.085 --> 19:18.053
No. Just Slim Shady
in all his glory.

19:18.087 --> 19:19.227
Short hair,

19:19.261 --> 19:21.470
bleach blond, hoop earrings,
nothing more.

19:21.505 --> 19:23.541
- That's it?
- That's it.

19:23.576 --> 19:26.165
Well, maybe Mr. Anderson really
does have it out for Noah.

19:26.199 --> 19:27.821
Apparently,
there is another parent

19:27.856 --> 19:29.444
who had their daughter pulled
from the school

19:29.478 --> 19:32.101
because of a possible
inappropriate relationship

19:32.136 --> 19:33.206
with an educator.

19:33.241 --> 19:36.002
And you think
it was Mr. Anderson,

19:36.036 --> 19:39.419
because Noah implied that
he crossed a line with Kayla?

19:39.454 --> 19:41.249
If Mr. Anderson was having

19:41.283 --> 19:43.320
an inappropriate relationship
with Kayla,

19:43.354 --> 19:45.874
it would make sense that
he wanted Noah out of the way.

19:45.908 --> 19:47.703
And it would
give Mr. Anderson

19:47.738 --> 19:49.153
motive to kill her.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.224
I mean, that baby
would have taken him down.

19:51.259 --> 19:52.846
Well, if he killed Kayla,

19:52.881 --> 19:54.986
he may end up taking
the whole school down.

19:55.021 --> 19:57.851
Mark Adams almost certainly
was driving over the limit.

19:57.886 --> 19:59.370
One bartender alone

19:59.405 --> 20:02.960
served up five Jack and Cokes
in a little over an hour.

20:02.994 --> 20:05.307
We got him on tape getting
into the driver's seat

20:05.342 --> 20:07.033
right out of that bar.

20:07.067 --> 20:09.277
Okay. So we have proof
that he got behind the wheel

20:09.311 --> 20:10.657
after he was drinking.

20:10.692 --> 20:12.245
- What else?
- License platereaders

20:12.280 --> 20:15.593
show that he went from the bar
to the AMC Bay Terrace.

20:15.628 --> 20:17.077
He went to the movies?

20:17.112 --> 20:18.700
We found him on surveillance
picking up his son

20:18.734 --> 20:19.942
and two of his friends.

20:19.977 --> 20:22.048
Were they in the car
when he crashed?

20:22.082 --> 20:23.912
It looks like
he dropped them off,

20:23.946 --> 20:26.535
then took out a stop sign
and a few trash cans

20:26.570 --> 20:28.123
before heading
back out.

20:28.157 --> 20:31.920
Okay, so now we're talking
about an aggravated DWI

20:31.954 --> 20:34.647
with kids in the vehicle--
that's an automatic felony.

20:34.681 --> 20:36.235
Do you think
that Dorsey knew

20:36.269 --> 20:39.065
his buddy put three kids' lives
at risk?

20:39.099 --> 20:41.343
I think there's a chance he did.

20:41.378 --> 20:44.104
I think we should speak to him
before jumping to conclusions.

20:44.139 --> 20:45.692
Well, then you
better speak to him,

20:45.727 --> 20:47.315
because I'm ready to jump.

20:51.905 --> 20:53.804
Heard you call practically
every member of the U Club

20:53.838 --> 20:57.048
to check on my alibi-- half the
city thinks I killed her now.

20:57.083 --> 20:59.258
I'm sorry that
I didn't believe you.

20:59.292 --> 21:00.500
I am.

21:00.535 --> 21:02.606
What do you want?

21:02.640 --> 21:05.091
Proof that Mr. Anderson had

21:05.125 --> 21:07.127
an inappropriate relationship
with Kayla.

21:07.162 --> 21:08.232
What kind of proof?

21:08.267 --> 21:10.027
Did you ever write
love letters to Kayla?

21:10.061 --> 21:11.822
You mean, like, pen and paper?

21:11.856 --> 21:13.893
Exactly why I didn't think
you were the one who wrote them.

21:13.927 --> 21:15.722
Do you think Mr. Anderson
might have had

21:15.757 --> 21:17.310
any other
inappropriate relationships

21:17.345 --> 21:18.587
with somebody besides Kayla?

21:18.622 --> 21:20.140
There was this girl,

21:20.175 --> 21:22.626
Alyssa, whose parents took her
out of school last year.

21:22.660 --> 21:24.110
There was rumors

21:24.144 --> 21:26.285
about another one, but
I don't know for sure.

21:26.319 --> 21:27.527
Does this other one have a name?

21:27.562 --> 21:29.529
Nadia...

21:29.564 --> 21:31.220
something.

21:31.255 --> 21:33.982
Total smokeshow,
but she was a bit off.

21:34.016 --> 21:37.572
She was, like, a Russian
diplomat's daughter.

21:37.606 --> 21:40.609
Kept to herself, but was always
with Anderson in his office.

21:40.644 --> 21:42.818
Okay. Good to know.

21:42.853 --> 21:44.682
I had no idea there were kids
in the car.

21:44.717 --> 21:46.028
Any way to prove that?

21:46.063 --> 21:47.236
Really?
'Cause I'm telling the truth.

21:47.271 --> 21:48.548
One of them is my godson.

21:48.583 --> 21:49.549
Who, Mark's boy?

21:49.584 --> 21:51.102
Yeah.

21:51.137 --> 21:52.794
Look, nobody got hurt
except for his front bumper.

21:52.828 --> 21:54.071
Would you guys just let it go?

21:54.105 --> 21:56.349
He put the lives
of three children at risk.

21:56.384 --> 21:57.764
Which I didn't know.

21:57.799 --> 21:58.765
Doesn't work

21:58.800 --> 22:00.422
that way, and you know it.

22:00.457 --> 22:02.010
He's a good guy

22:02.044 --> 22:03.874
who just happens
to drink too much.

22:03.908 --> 22:05.738
Then why not get him
some real help?

22:06.497 --> 22:07.878
I didn't realize it was so bad.

22:07.912 --> 22:09.155
How many times
you bailing him out

22:09.189 --> 22:10.363
is it gonna take?

22:10.398 --> 22:11.778
Anthony, you know me.

22:11.813 --> 22:13.780
Okay? I'm all about having
your back.

22:13.815 --> 22:15.782
Yeah, well, who's gonna have
your godson's back, huh?

22:15.817 --> 22:17.750
And those other kids.

22:22.064 --> 22:24.204
I read
your statement to the press.

22:24.239 --> 22:26.655
All due respect,
I think you piled on.

22:26.690 --> 22:28.485
Respectfully, I disagree.

22:28.519 --> 22:30.210
If anything, I went easy on him.

22:30.245 --> 22:32.489
He didn't deserve a public
shaming from this office.

22:32.523 --> 22:35.526
And if it were anyone else,
you'd be leading the charge.

22:35.561 --> 22:38.322
- That's not true.
- So you really think he deserves
special treatment?

22:38.357 --> 22:39.944
Just equal treatment.
If he weren't my husband,

22:39.979 --> 22:41.360
would you have felt the need

22:41.394 --> 22:43.845
to come out so quickly
- with a response?
- Okay.

22:43.879 --> 22:46.054
We can play "what if"
all day long,

22:46.088 --> 22:49.885
but the fact is, based
on the reality of the situation,

22:49.920 --> 22:52.854
I did what I needed to do.

22:53.924 --> 22:56.409
That's what I did, Abigail.
Come on.

23:11.079 --> 23:12.908
Well...

23:15.463 --> 23:18.258
Brian asked for a separation.

23:24.195 --> 23:26.232
I'm sorry.

23:28.683 --> 23:32.894
My job has always been an issue
in our marriage.

23:34.551 --> 23:36.760
We started at the academy
together,

23:36.794 --> 23:39.797
and then Brian watched
as I climbed the ranks

23:39.832 --> 23:41.696
while he was still writing
parking tickets.

23:41.730 --> 23:43.663
Look, the work he does
on the street

23:43.698 --> 23:46.873
is just as important
as any job at One PP.

23:47.667 --> 23:50.152
He never saw it that way.

23:51.153 --> 23:53.086
Abigail...

23:53.121 --> 23:55.779
he has no one to blame
but himself.

23:58.954 --> 24:01.785
He almost died
from that shooting.

24:08.101 --> 24:12.002
And that just might be
why we're in this mess.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.455
What is that supposed to mean?

24:16.489 --> 24:19.147
How quickly did he recover?

24:19.181 --> 24:21.114
He blew through
his physical therapy

24:21.149 --> 24:23.289
and was back on the job
in three months.

24:23.323 --> 24:26.499
But I'm talking
about his mental health.

24:26.534 --> 24:28.984
That recovery.

24:30.020 --> 24:32.954
I've tried getting him
into therapy.

24:37.648 --> 24:39.926
Well, I wish
you would've told me.

24:41.928 --> 24:44.931
I can't share everything
with you.

24:46.933 --> 24:49.902
It would be bad for both of us.

24:53.250 --> 24:55.010
Okay.

24:57.875 --> 25:00.257
Thank you
for coming down, Nadia.

25:00.291 --> 25:02.017
Yeah, I'm not sure
why I'm here.

25:02.052 --> 25:05.296
We're interviewing everyone that
was on campus on October 29.

25:05.331 --> 25:06.884
Were you close with Kayla?

25:06.919 --> 25:09.611
No. No. She was in my
physics class, but that was it.

25:09.646 --> 25:11.440
So you wouldn't consider
yourself friends.

25:11.475 --> 25:12.614
No, I wouldn't.

25:12.649 --> 25:13.926
Did you know that Kayla

25:13.960 --> 25:15.928
had a relationship
with Mr. Anderson?

25:15.962 --> 25:17.861
What do you mean, like a mentor?

25:17.895 --> 25:21.243
We have reason to believe
it went beyond that.

25:21.278 --> 25:22.451
Like they had

25:22.486 --> 25:24.315
love feelings for each other.

25:24.350 --> 25:26.421
No, that can't be true.
He'd never have

25:26.455 --> 25:28.561
an inappropriate relationship
with a student.

25:28.596 --> 25:30.321
And you're sure about that?

25:30.356 --> 25:31.668
Mr. Anderson is good

25:31.702 --> 25:33.152
at his job, so he...

25:33.186 --> 25:35.395
he cares deeply
about all of his students,

25:35.430 --> 25:37.432
but that's as far as it goes.

25:37.466 --> 25:38.847
Well,

25:38.882 --> 25:42.782
these love letters
make us believe otherwise.

25:42.817 --> 25:44.059
Love letters?

25:44.094 --> 25:46.441
Yeah, like this one.
"I can't fight

25:46.475 --> 25:47.994
"this feeling any longer,

25:48.029 --> 25:51.273
and yet I'm afraid
to let..."Stop. No, you're lying.

25:52.758 --> 25:54.276
Actually, I'm not lying.

25:54.311 --> 25:57.694
"What started out as friendship
has grown stronger."

25:57.728 --> 26:00.593
He... he didn't...
he didn't write that to her.

26:00.628 --> 26:02.388
No, REO Speedwagon wrote that.

26:02.422 --> 26:04.114
But he did send it to her.

26:04.148 --> 26:06.047
No. No,
you're just trying to trick me.

26:06.081 --> 26:08.601
Let me guess.
He wrote the same lyrics to you?

26:08.636 --> 26:10.154
No, I never said that.

26:10.189 --> 26:11.224
Then why so upset?

26:11.259 --> 26:12.950
Maybe it's because you knew
he was having

26:12.985 --> 26:14.607
an inappropriate relationship

26:14.642 --> 26:16.333
- with Kayla.
- No, no.

26:16.367 --> 26:19.163
And was also having
an inappropriate relationship

26:19.198 --> 26:20.717
with you.

26:22.511 --> 26:25.273
I don't have to stay here.
I have diplomatic immunity.

26:25.307 --> 26:26.757
We know you do.

26:26.792 --> 26:29.380
But stay here and help us
figure out who killed Kay...

26:29.415 --> 26:31.175
No, I can't help you.

26:38.769 --> 26:40.702
Oh, don't mind me.

26:40.737 --> 26:42.601
Just finishing up.

26:42.635 --> 26:44.775
Then I'll get
out of your hair.

26:47.019 --> 26:49.159
Um, actually,
I'm glad you're here,

26:49.193 --> 26:51.126
so I can...

26:51.161 --> 26:53.301
say goodbye.

26:53.335 --> 26:55.096
Till when?

26:56.097 --> 26:57.926
I don't know.

27:01.447 --> 27:03.035
S-So you're taking a leave?

27:03.069 --> 27:05.037
Yeah.

27:07.108 --> 27:08.627
For...?

27:08.661 --> 27:11.388
For good.

27:11.422 --> 27:14.115
I'm putting my papers in.

27:15.806 --> 27:18.050
I just ran out of gas.

27:18.947 --> 27:21.087
If you're asking <i>why</i> for.

27:23.642 --> 27:26.610
Just... please don't think
I'm a quitter.

27:26.645 --> 27:29.509
That thought
never crossed my mind.

27:29.544 --> 27:32.029
I guess it was just...

27:32.064 --> 27:35.481
the disgusting loogie
that broke this camel's back.

27:39.105 --> 27:41.970
Is there any chance
I could change your mind?

27:42.005 --> 27:43.592
No.

27:44.559 --> 27:46.216
Not even you.

27:47.666 --> 27:50.047
Well, could you do me a favor?

27:50.082 --> 27:51.255
Yeah, if I can.

27:51.290 --> 27:53.154
See the commissioner
when you're up there.

27:53.188 --> 27:54.465
No.

27:54.500 --> 27:56.778
He would never say anything,
but he'd be pretty hurt.

27:56.813 --> 27:59.401
Yeah, I just...

27:59.436 --> 28:01.956
I can't do that.

28:02.750 --> 28:04.717
Yeah.

28:06.270 --> 28:08.963
Do you ever regret
coming back on the job?

28:12.138 --> 28:13.968
No.

28:21.527 --> 28:24.116
I'm gonna sleep soundly knowing
that you're still out there

28:24.150 --> 28:25.669
on patrol.

28:26.463 --> 28:27.671
Singing off-key

28:27.706 --> 28:28.914
to Fleetwood Mac and...

28:28.948 --> 28:30.570
checking your hair
in the rearview.

28:30.605 --> 28:32.918
What?

28:38.337 --> 28:40.719
I got your six wherever you go.

28:42.410 --> 28:44.136
I know you do.

29:24.279 --> 29:26.350
Want a drink?

29:26.385 --> 29:28.767
Little early for me.

29:29.733 --> 29:31.908
Just a Guinness.

29:33.841 --> 29:36.913
That, uh, perp you collared
matched the description

29:36.947 --> 29:40.088
of the guy
who shot you and your partner.

29:40.123 --> 29:42.056
That set you off?

29:43.851 --> 29:46.025
Wouldn't be an excuse.

29:46.060 --> 29:48.821
No, it would not.

29:48.856 --> 29:51.893
But it might give some insight.

29:53.170 --> 29:56.622
I guess I got
some resentment, yeah.

29:56.656 --> 29:58.866
But... the perp you collared

29:58.900 --> 30:00.799
wasn't your shooter.

30:00.833 --> 30:02.697
He's been put away for life.

30:02.731 --> 30:03.871
I know that.

30:03.905 --> 30:05.769
Then act like it...

30:05.804 --> 30:08.530
if there's a next time.

30:16.573 --> 30:20.991
Cops roughing up collars wasn't
all right when it was all right.

30:21.026 --> 30:23.925
- I know that, too.
- Then act like it...

30:24.892 --> 30:26.928
if there's a next time.

30:32.175 --> 30:35.281
You sitting here day-drinking,
toasting your new freedom

30:35.316 --> 30:37.525
from your wife and kids?

30:40.148 --> 30:42.012
No.

30:42.047 --> 30:43.945
Well...

30:43.980 --> 30:47.259
at least that part
of your brain's working.

30:57.131 --> 30:59.236
You took a bullet
in the line of duty.

30:59.271 --> 31:02.653
You not only lived,
but you went back on the job.

31:03.931 --> 31:06.174
There's only a handful of cops
like you

31:06.209 --> 31:08.797
in the history
of this department,

31:08.832 --> 31:12.008
and they're held
in the highest esteem.

31:17.116 --> 31:18.842
Make them proud...

31:18.877 --> 31:21.776
if there's a next time.

31:42.176 --> 31:43.315
Gina Adams?

31:43.349 --> 31:45.765
- Yes.
- I'm Anthony Abetemarco

31:45.800 --> 31:47.043
from the D.A.'s office.

31:47.077 --> 31:48.320
What do you want?

31:48.354 --> 31:49.355
Your husband home?

31:49.390 --> 31:51.219
Sorry, you just missed him.

31:53.739 --> 31:54.913
Listen to me.

31:54.947 --> 31:56.155
I'm here to help you.

31:56.190 --> 31:57.674
I don't need your help.

31:57.708 --> 31:58.986
Come on, give me a break.

31:59.020 --> 32:00.539
Your husband's put you
and your son in danger.

32:00.573 --> 32:02.023
You don't know anything.

32:02.058 --> 32:04.198
Where did he go?
- Tell me where he went.
- He's fine.

32:04.232 --> 32:06.234
You don't need to worry.
He's with Kyle.

32:10.929 --> 32:14.656
Do you think Nadia is capable
of killing Kayla?

32:14.691 --> 32:16.382
With the right amount of hurt,

32:16.417 --> 32:18.591
[phone rings]there's no telling
what anyone's capable of.

32:18.626 --> 32:20.283
You know that. Reagan.

32:21.422 --> 32:23.079
You're kidding me.

32:24.080 --> 32:28.463
We're on our way. Nadia's
got Anderson at gunpoint.

32:28.498 --> 32:28.947
She wants to speak to us.

32:38.715 --> 32:40.199
What are we looking at, boss?

32:40.234 --> 32:41.960
She's got a gun
to his head.

32:41.994 --> 32:44.928
She's been waiting
on you.
Okay.

32:44.963 --> 32:47.172
Watch the exit.

32:57.251 --> 32:59.632
Okay, I'm gonna need you
to put that gun down, Nadia.

33:00.875 --> 33:02.704
Not till he admits
what he did.

33:02.739 --> 33:04.741
Nadia, I didn't kill Kayla.

33:04.775 --> 33:06.018
It was your fault!

33:06.053 --> 33:08.745
The blood is on your
hands, not mine.

33:08.779 --> 33:11.782
Nadia, I can't help you
till you put that gun down.

33:11.817 --> 33:12.921
He told me

33:12.956 --> 33:14.509
he loved me.

33:14.544 --> 33:16.028
And I believed him!

33:16.063 --> 33:17.788
Told you he loved you

33:17.823 --> 33:20.101
and took advantage of you?

33:20.136 --> 33:22.966
I didn't take advantage... No, you got Kayla pregnant,
and when I heard,

33:23.001 --> 33:24.761
I freaked out!
I didn't...

33:24.795 --> 33:26.176
I didn't mean to hurt her.

33:26.211 --> 33:28.006
I didn't mean to hurt her.
- I swear!
- Okay.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.248
I followed her
to the bathroom

33:29.283 --> 33:30.767
and told her to get
rid of the baby.

33:30.801 --> 33:33.942
The baby would have
destroyed him, and he was mine!

33:33.977 --> 33:36.152
My chance at a happy life!

33:36.186 --> 33:37.601
- She's lying.
- Admit it!

33:37.636 --> 33:39.500
- Admit it, or I will kill you!
- Okay, okay, okay.

33:39.534 --> 33:42.951
I had sex with you and Kayla.
Is that what you need to hear?

33:42.986 --> 33:44.677
This is your fault.

33:44.712 --> 33:46.058
Say it. Say it!

33:46.093 --> 33:49.475
Oh! Okay! It was my fault!
It's my fault, okay?

33:50.580 --> 33:52.030
He admitted it.

33:52.064 --> 33:53.928
Nadia...

33:53.962 --> 33:55.999
he said it was
his fault.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.587
Okay, now, take it easy.

33:57.621 --> 33:59.347
Just tell me what happened,
all right? Let's end this.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.697
We got in a fight and she fell.

34:04.732 --> 34:06.251
And then...

34:06.285 --> 34:08.494
and then there was
so much blood.

34:08.529 --> 34:10.807
There was so much blood.

34:10.841 --> 34:12.188
No, I'm sorry.

34:12.222 --> 34:14.638
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Okay, okay.

34:14.673 --> 34:17.055
Okay, okay, okay. Baez!

34:21.921 --> 34:23.302
Hey, come here.

34:23.337 --> 34:24.890
- Come here.
- Wait a minute. What the hell?

34:24.924 --> 34:26.409
Look, I-I'm the victim here.

34:26.443 --> 34:29.274
Nadia was 16
when you started your affair.

34:29.308 --> 34:30.620
She's a victim
of statutory rape,

34:30.654 --> 34:31.724
so you're both under arrest.

34:31.759 --> 34:33.485
Then she lied!

34:33.519 --> 34:35.280
She said she was 17!

34:36.350 --> 34:37.937
Please...

34:38.697 --> 34:39.974
Come on. Come on.

34:41.907 --> 34:43.598
I don't know.

34:43.633 --> 34:45.290
I'll ask again.
Where are they?

34:45.324 --> 34:47.671
I told you,
I haven't seen them.

34:48.465 --> 34:50.881
Bill, you could
trust him.

34:50.916 --> 34:52.780
Anthony, you in on this, too?

34:52.814 --> 34:54.471
They in the dog house?

34:55.955 --> 34:58.303
Come with me.

35:20.911 --> 35:22.982
No...

35:23.017 --> 35:24.294
What is this, Anthony?

35:24.329 --> 35:25.916
Only one of them
could stop the fight here.

35:25.951 --> 35:27.918
That's how it works.

35:30.576 --> 35:34.408
You put your own kid at risk.
Who the hell does that?

35:35.340 --> 35:36.513
My godson.

35:36.548 --> 35:38.101
What's it gonna take?

35:38.136 --> 35:40.345
Huh?

35:41.173 --> 35:42.795
I'll stop!

35:42.830 --> 35:44.452
I swear this time I mean it!

35:44.487 --> 35:45.557
I don't believe you.

35:47.593 --> 35:50.217
- How you gonna stop?
- I'll go to rehab.

35:50.251 --> 35:51.079
Oh!

35:53.496 --> 35:54.531
Where?!

35:54.566 --> 35:58.294
Wherever you tell me!

35:59.329 --> 36:01.676
For as long as you say!

36:12.031 --> 36:13.895
Come on.

36:30.912 --> 36:33.225
You here all day?

36:33.260 --> 36:35.054
Yes.

36:35.089 --> 36:37.298
Your mom okay alone
with the kids?

36:38.265 --> 36:40.474
Brian asked us to come home.

36:42.959 --> 36:44.581
Oh.

36:45.927 --> 36:48.275
That's a good thing?

36:49.276 --> 36:51.692
He said he needs to be needed,

36:51.726 --> 36:56.352
and... he knows
he needs to get help.

36:59.182 --> 37:02.047
Did you send someone
to talk to him?

37:02.081 --> 37:03.290
No.

37:03.324 --> 37:06.154
I did not send someone
to talk to him.

37:09.606 --> 37:11.367
Are we good?

37:12.160 --> 37:14.370
We're good.

37:22.654 --> 37:24.932
My best one,
I had my poli-sci teacher

37:24.966 --> 37:28.073
come in dressed
as Hillary Clinton.

37:28.107 --> 37:30.455
What, like, in a
pantsuit and pearls?

37:30.489 --> 37:32.284
And a big blonde wig
and lipstick.

37:32.319 --> 37:33.561
She do that big laugh?

37:33.596 --> 37:35.908
It's a he.
Professor Pete Bartley.

37:35.943 --> 37:36.978
And yes, he did,

37:37.013 --> 37:38.842
and it was terrifying.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.225
The best costume
I've seen is molten lava

37:42.260 --> 37:44.469
going as... this chili.

37:44.503 --> 37:46.298
What is in this?

37:46.333 --> 37:47.126
Yeah.

37:47.161 --> 37:50.751
Beef, pork, kidney beans...

37:50.785 --> 37:52.580
spices.

37:52.615 --> 37:53.823
What spices?

37:53.857 --> 37:55.480
Gunpowder.

37:55.514 --> 37:56.998
Et tu Brute?

37:57.033 --> 37:58.931
It's good, Gramps.
Really good.

37:58.966 --> 38:00.450
It's just...

38:00.485 --> 38:01.796
it's challenging.

38:01.831 --> 38:03.281
"Challenging." I like that.

38:03.315 --> 38:04.385
Yeah.

38:04.420 --> 38:05.973
I had a case
outside a Wild West saloon

38:06.007 --> 38:07.975
masquerading as a cop bar.

38:08.009 --> 38:10.218
Any guesses?

38:11.081 --> 38:13.636
Does the name
O'Rourke's ring a bell?

38:13.670 --> 38:15.465
Distantly.

38:15.500 --> 38:16.673
An oldie

38:16.708 --> 38:17.950
but goodie.

38:17.985 --> 38:20.505
- What about it?
- Oh, so you know about it?

38:20.539 --> 38:21.747
What cop doesn't?

38:21.782 --> 38:24.094
Well, me, till the other day.

38:24.129 --> 38:26.614
And Anthony was all,
"You don't want to know."

38:26.649 --> 38:28.167
So spill it.

38:28.202 --> 38:30.998
Well, I'm not gonna spill
the beans to you, Counselor.

38:31.032 --> 38:32.171
Aiding and abetting?

38:32.206 --> 38:33.414
Whose side are you on?

38:33.449 --> 38:34.588
The law.

38:34.622 --> 38:35.727
Hmm.

38:35.761 --> 38:37.315
Yeah, well, look,
back in the day,

38:37.349 --> 38:40.939
things were pretty bad
between the FDNY and the NYPD,

38:40.973 --> 38:44.322
especially our emergency services unit.

38:44.356 --> 38:46.600
Yeah. They'd both arrive
on the scene

38:46.634 --> 38:49.119
and then fight
over jurisdiction.

38:49.154 --> 38:51.570
One night...

38:51.605 --> 38:56.161
this FDNY battalion chief
and a woman not his wife

38:56.195 --> 38:58.336
decided to go skinny-dipping

38:58.370 --> 39:02.892
in the East River--
well, ESU had to fish them out.

39:02.926 --> 39:06.758
And this fair-minded cop--
no names--

39:07.621 --> 39:09.899
decided to take him
to O'Rourke's

39:09.933 --> 39:13.109
and call the ladder company
to come get their boss.

39:13.143 --> 39:15.318
Thus saving the FDNY

39:15.353 --> 39:17.009
the humiliation.
There you go.

39:17.044 --> 39:18.632
- So, you see,it's not

39:18.666 --> 39:20.081
a Wild West saloon.

39:20.116 --> 39:22.567
It's a place where
the bravest and the finest

39:22.601 --> 39:24.396
can help a brother in need

39:24.431 --> 39:26.398
without the whole world knowing
about it.

39:26.433 --> 39:29.574
Boy, you guys
can really romanticize things.

39:29.608 --> 39:31.265
It's not romanticizing

39:31.299 --> 39:33.163
when you're just telling it
- like it is.
I mean,

39:33.198 --> 39:35.545
just because somebody
somewhere decided

39:35.580 --> 39:39.480
everybody has the right to know
how every sausage is made

39:39.515 --> 39:40.999
doesn't make it so.

39:41.033 --> 39:42.276
Right, Pop?

39:42.310 --> 39:43.346
Amen.

39:46.901 --> 39:51.147
Well, I think I have the right
to know what is in the chili.

39:51.181 --> 39:52.493
Yeah.

39:58.810 --> 40:00.915
If you have a moment.

40:01.709 --> 40:03.642
For you? Always.

40:03.677 --> 40:05.333
Not for me.

40:26.389 --> 40:28.253
Please.

40:37.400 --> 40:40.334
I wish it hadn't come to this.

40:41.128 --> 40:42.750
How did you know?

40:42.785 --> 40:46.133
Oh, I'm the police commissioner.
I know everything.

40:50.068 --> 40:51.897
I came...

40:51.932 --> 40:54.141
to say I'm sorry.

40:57.040 --> 40:59.353
This is not your fault.

41:04.531 --> 41:06.533
Thank you.

41:07.879 --> 41:10.433
That is much appreciated.

41:13.229 --> 41:16.439
You know, you got a year
to change your mind.

41:17.544 --> 41:20.167
I know that.

41:20.201 --> 41:23.204
Please don't try
to talk me out of it.

41:23.239 --> 41:26.380
I did that once already.

41:26.414 --> 41:28.382
So I won't.

41:29.728 --> 41:31.419
Thank you.

41:31.454 --> 41:35.700
But I would...
like to ask a favor.

41:35.734 --> 41:37.874
If I can.

41:37.909 --> 41:41.015
That, uh, a year from today,

41:41.050 --> 41:44.260
you get in touch with me.

41:44.294 --> 41:47.021
If not to re-up, then...

41:47.056 --> 41:49.472
just to catch up.

41:52.302 --> 41:54.857
Yes, sir.

41:54.891 --> 41:57.204
I will do that gladly.

42:04.349 --> 42:07.248
Thanks for your service,
Officer Witten.

42:08.042 --> 42:10.528
Thank you, sir.

42:17.086 --> 42:20.020
Good luck, Rachel.

42:25.750 --> 42:28.304
You, too, Commissioner.
