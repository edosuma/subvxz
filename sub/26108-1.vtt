00:31.901 --> 00:34.077
All right.

00:34.121 --> 00:37.254
If you could get off that for
a minute, I'd like to get up.

00:39.822 --> 00:40.997
Ah.

[door opens]

01:55.202 --> 01:56.812
[Betty] You're addicted.

01:58.640 --> 02:02.122
What's a six-letter word
for bride-to-be?

02:04.472 --> 02:07.257
Is it fiancÃ©?

02:07.301 --> 02:09.824
FiancÃ©. No, that's five.

02:11.522 --> 02:14.046
I don't know why
you're wasting your time.

02:14.090 --> 02:16.048
You got to stop
opening my mail, Mom.

02:16.092 --> 02:18.573
How many no's
do you need to hear?

02:20.052 --> 02:22.533
Would it kill you
to comb your hair?

02:25.014 --> 02:27.408
Did the benefits go through yet?

02:27.451 --> 02:29.192
No. We got to wait
for the appeal.

02:29.236 --> 02:30.628
How long is that going to take?

02:30.672 --> 02:32.891
- I don't know.
- Huh?

02:32.935 --> 02:34.110
I filled the forms out.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.590
Well, did you do it
the right way,

02:35.633 --> 02:37.548
like I showed you?

02:37.592 --> 02:39.463
[cat meows]

02:39.507 --> 02:41.335
Hi, Paul.

02:42.423 --> 02:44.207
Did you hear what I said?

03:27.946 --> 03:29.600
[phone rings]

03:31.689 --> 03:34.301
- Hi.
- Hi, you're from Unitemp?

03:34.344 --> 03:35.954
Yeah.

03:35.998 --> 03:38.305
[Deb] She was here a few days
last month. Remember?

03:38.348 --> 03:40.785
What was your name again?

03:40.829 --> 03:42.047
Nancy.

03:43.875 --> 03:46.530
- Must be nice being a temp.
- [microwave buttons beeping]

03:46.574 --> 03:49.316
You get to set
your own schedule.

03:49.359 --> 03:50.534
I mean, it's okay.

03:52.623 --> 03:53.929
Where did you go on vacation?

03:53.972 --> 03:56.323
- The DPRK.
- Where's that?

03:56.366 --> 03:59.239
It's the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea.

04:00.631 --> 04:03.243
Wait, you went to North Korea?

04:03.286 --> 04:05.046
[Deb] Oh, my friend just got
back from there.

04:05.070 --> 04:06.681
She said it has
a really good shopping.

04:06.724 --> 04:08.335
[Raj] Deb, that's South Korea.

04:08.378 --> 04:09.738
There's no shopping
in North Korea.

04:09.771 --> 04:11.947
There's barely any food.

04:11.990 --> 04:16.081
How the hell
did you get in exactly?

04:16.125 --> 04:17.909
Oh, it's, like, really easy.

04:17.952 --> 04:20.041
You can go as
an American tourist,

04:20.084 --> 04:22.740
- you know, through a tourist company.
- Really?

04:22.784 --> 04:24.370
- [microwave beeps] - Yeah, you should go.
It's fascinating.

04:24.394 --> 04:25.613
We had a lot of fun.

04:25.656 --> 04:28.180
Actually, my wife's Korean

04:28.224 --> 04:30.139
and she doesn't know anyone
that's allowed in,

04:30.182 --> 04:32.054
except for, like,
diplomats so...

04:32.097 --> 04:35.579
Well, I have good photos
here from...

04:35.623 --> 04:37.625
- Photos?
- Mm-hmm.

04:40.018 --> 04:41.672
[Deb] Oh, that doesn't
look that bad.

04:41.716 --> 04:44.327
Yeah, that's... that's me.

04:44.371 --> 04:46.373
[Deb gasps]

04:46.416 --> 04:49.332
You just went by yourself or...

04:49.376 --> 04:51.639
Yeah, but then they put me
in group.

04:51.682 --> 04:55.033
- Who's... who's that?
- That's like the,

04:55.077 --> 04:57.949
like the leader
but, you know, it's a statue.

04:57.993 --> 05:00.952
- [gasps softly] Oh.
- Oh, wow. Sweet.

05:02.432 --> 05:03.912
Where is that?

05:03.955 --> 05:07.394
Uh... It's just kind of,
like, a field.

05:07.437 --> 05:09.396
What does that sign say?

05:09.439 --> 05:11.049
I don't know, it's...

05:11.093 --> 05:12.834
Korean.

05:32.375 --> 05:34.377
[Nancy] Looks like
you're feeling better.

05:36.466 --> 05:38.207
What is this?

05:40.470 --> 05:42.342
Just junk mail.

05:43.473 --> 05:44.866
What are you up to?

05:44.909 --> 05:47.347
- Nothing.

[Jeb14 voice] Becca,

06:18.421 --> 06:21.859
not a day goes by that
I don't think of my daughter.

06:21.903 --> 06:24.340
Even though she was
only on this earth for...

06:24.384 --> 06:27.474
for a few hours.

06:27.517 --> 06:30.825
I'll... I'll always cherish
those minutes forever.

06:33.262 --> 06:37.135
[Nancy's voice]
Thank you, Jeb14.

06:37.179 --> 06:39.007
It really means a lot.

06:41.009 --> 06:44.055
If it weren't
for people like you,

06:44.099 --> 06:46.231
I don't know what I'd do.

07:46.030 --> 07:48.076
[Nancy] How's the hand?

07:48.119 --> 07:49.294
[Betty] Sore.

07:52.297 --> 07:53.603
Sorry.

07:57.085 --> 07:59.174
You know, if your hand's
still hurting you tonight,

07:59.217 --> 08:01.350
then we can go get it
checked out.

08:01.393 --> 08:03.439
I think we should do it now.

08:03.483 --> 08:06.181
Ma, can you not open my mail?

08:06.224 --> 08:09.401
- I want to do it right now.
- I think we should wait.

08:09.445 --> 08:11.752
- Why, what are you doing now?
- Last time they said

08:11.795 --> 08:13.623
it was just part
of your symptoms and...

08:13.667 --> 08:15.407
Yeah, well...

08:15.451 --> 08:19.063
- You should expect that.
- That's easy for you to say.

08:19.107 --> 08:20.848
I'm sick of
waiting around for you.

08:20.891 --> 08:22.806
Always an excuse. No, not today.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.288
I don't want this.

08:27.942 --> 08:29.596
I don't want it.

08:29.639 --> 08:30.901
Get out of here.

08:30.945 --> 08:32.990
Get these eggs
and get out of here.

[doorbell jingles]

10:24.885 --> 10:26.147
You Becca?

10:27.757 --> 10:29.411
- Jeb.
- Yeah.

10:29.454 --> 10:31.848
I thought it was you.
I just... I just didn't

10:31.892 --> 10:34.851
know what you really
looked like, you know.

10:34.895 --> 10:36.200
Yeah.

10:36.244 --> 10:38.463
Hey, thanks for coming
all the way out here.

10:38.507 --> 10:40.683
That's okay.
I had a light day today.

10:47.211 --> 10:50.171
You ready to order?
We have a breakfast menu, too.

10:50.214 --> 10:52.652
Uh, not for me, I'm just
going to have a cappuccino.

10:52.695 --> 10:54.436
- Just a large coffee.
- Okay.

10:54.479 --> 10:56.177
Yeah.

10:56.220 --> 10:58.048
They say one cup a day is fine,

10:58.092 --> 11:00.094
and I'm pretty moderate.

11:00.137 --> 11:01.965
That's good.

11:03.793 --> 11:07.667
Hey, uh, it probably
seems really weird that I'm...

11:07.710 --> 11:09.930
It's weird, because, I mean,
I could be a total creep

11:09.973 --> 11:11.975
from the Internet
for all you know.

11:12.019 --> 11:14.586
No, no, I can tell you're not.

11:14.630 --> 11:16.327
Well, thank you.

11:19.809 --> 11:21.506
So, um...

11:24.814 --> 11:26.468
When are you due?

11:27.861 --> 11:29.645
Oh, in a couple of months,

11:29.689 --> 11:34.171
but the doctors are worried
it might be premature so...

11:34.215 --> 11:37.305
You know what, I'm really glad
you decided to keep it.

11:37.348 --> 11:40.787
Well, you helped me decide,
actually.

11:40.830 --> 11:42.614
Really?

11:42.658 --> 11:44.573
Mm-hmm.

11:44.616 --> 11:47.794
You know, I think it's so great,
that blog you write.

11:47.837 --> 11:50.187
I mean, the way you write,

11:50.231 --> 11:52.363
you have a gift, you know that.

11:55.845 --> 11:57.238
Thank you.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.165
So, how did you find me,
anyways?

12:13.123 --> 12:15.822
Well, after my daughter died
my wife, well,

12:15.865 --> 12:19.434
my ex-wife now, just stopped
talking to me altogether.

12:20.827 --> 12:22.263
She started thinking that, um,

12:22.306 --> 12:24.526
we made a mistake
having the baby even,

12:24.569 --> 12:26.876
because we were going
to lose it right away,

12:26.920 --> 12:29.139
and so, after that
I started looking online

12:29.183 --> 12:31.228
and looking at
all these websites.

12:31.272 --> 12:35.363
[chuckles] Anyway, that's...
that's how I found you.

12:37.408 --> 12:39.628
What was her name,
your daughter?

12:42.892 --> 12:45.025
My daughter's name was Joey.

12:54.469 --> 12:56.601
Sorry,
I just feel like I know you.

12:57.689 --> 12:59.213
Me, too.

13:57.967 --> 14:00.056
I brought you some sushi.

14:00.100 --> 14:02.058
I don't eat raw fish.
You know that.

14:02.102 --> 14:04.365
It has mercury in it.

14:04.408 --> 14:06.323
Well, I'll give it
to Paul, then.

14:06.367 --> 14:09.849
Don't give it to Paul.
It'll make him sick.

14:09.892 --> 14:12.373
Remember when Stan gave
him that raw tuna?

14:12.416 --> 14:14.766
He threw up all day.
Nearly killed him.

14:14.810 --> 14:18.509
Yeah, you pretty much let Stan
do whatever he wanted, huh?

14:28.650 --> 14:30.130
[sighs]

14:31.218 --> 14:33.220
[Nancy] What?

14:33.263 --> 14:36.179
I can't lift up my arm.

14:36.223 --> 14:38.007
Well, it's probably just
gone to sleep.

14:38.051 --> 14:39.966
I don't think so.

14:40.009 --> 14:42.620
Oh. Ah.

14:42.664 --> 14:45.797
Yeah, right there. Yeah, yeah.

Miss Freeman. I am so sorry.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.560
Your mother had
a severe ischemic stroke.

16:36.604 --> 16:38.736
It appears she passed away
in her sleep.

16:38.780 --> 16:41.217
Her ongoing Parkinson's
may have increased

16:41.261 --> 16:43.350
the risk for a stroke
of this magnitude.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.224
Miss Freeman?

17:02.064 --> 17:05.589
[man] We have found that
it is very helpful

17:05.633 --> 17:11.421
in the healing process
for her family or friends.

17:11.464 --> 17:15.382
Have you thought about what kind
of a service you would like?

17:28.134 --> 17:32.007
It's Nancy Freeman here,

You used to go to church
with her.

Hey.

18:54.829 --> 18:57.875
I thought it was you.
You look so different.

18:57.919 --> 19:00.748
Yeah, I'm not
wearing any makeup.

19:00.791 --> 19:03.229
You know, I've been
calling you all day.

19:03.272 --> 19:04.578
Come on, you okay?

19:04.621 --> 19:06.061
Yeah, I haven't been
feeling so good.

19:06.085 --> 19:08.087

Come on, Becca, talk to me.

- Don't do this.
- No, I can't talk.

Come on, don't do this.

what's going on.

Are you okay?

19:46.881 --> 19:48.752
I never had the baby. It died.

19:50.450 --> 19:52.713
What? What-what are you
talking about? When?

19:52.756 --> 19:54.628
Before we met.

19:54.671 --> 19:56.891
Be-before we met?

19:59.198 --> 20:00.373
Why would...

20:00.416 --> 20:02.462
Why would you do
something like that?

20:02.505 --> 20:04.942
Well, you said that I was
helping you and...

20:04.986 --> 20:07.306
- You told me you named...
- I didn't want to let you down.

20:07.336 --> 20:09.817
What, so you make up a lie
about a sick baby?

20:09.860 --> 20:11.297
You make that shit up?

20:11.340 --> 20:13.124
No, I just lied about when.

That's all.

Here in Oswego, 30 years ago,

22:03.060 --> 22:05.672
when Mr. And Mrs. Lynch's
five-year-old daughter, Brooke,

22:05.715 --> 22:08.631
disappeared from their local shopping
mall a week before Christmas.

22:08.675 --> 22:11.199
The shocking case ripped
through the community

22:11.242 --> 22:14.071
as neighbors and friends came
together to search for Brooke

22:14.115 --> 22:16.204
in the weeks following
her disappearance.

22:16.247 --> 22:18.380
She was never seen again.

22:18.424 --> 22:21.383
Ten years ago, her family started
a college scholarship fund

22:21.427 --> 22:23.037
in remembrance
of their daughter.

22:23.080 --> 22:24.908
We spoke to Mr. And Mrs. Lynch

22:24.952 --> 22:26.649
on how they're
honoring her today.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.566
[woman] It's like
it was just yesterday.

22:32.176 --> 22:34.788
I can still see her so clearly.

22:34.831 --> 22:37.660
That year when
she was five is...

22:37.704 --> 22:40.924
it's frozen in time
in my memory.

22:40.968 --> 22:43.448
[newsman] On the anniversary of
the last time the Lynch family

22:43.472 --> 22:46.452
saw their daughter, they're
hosting a fundraising gala.

22:46.495 --> 22:49.629
We wanted her-her life
to count for something.

22:51.195 --> 22:54.373
So, we decided to...
That the best way

22:54.416 --> 22:57.071
to preserve Brooke's memory

22:57.114 --> 22:59.595
was to help...

22:59.639 --> 23:03.033
a child who might be economically
disadvantaged to get to college.

23:04.513 --> 23:05.993
Brooke would have liked that.

23:06.036 --> 23:09.736
Yeah, she was very smart.
She was so smart.

23:09.779 --> 23:12.173
She was, she was
a really creative child.

23:12.216 --> 23:14.915
She really loved learning
and this seemed like

23:14.958 --> 23:18.309
the best way to commemorate her.

23:18.353 --> 23:20.877
[newsman] The National Center for
Missing and Exploited Children

23:20.921 --> 23:23.402
recently released
an age progression photo.

23:23.445 --> 23:27.710
It's what they believe Brooke Lynch
would look like now at 35-years-old.

23:27.754 --> 23:31.366
[TV chatter continues,
indistinct]

24:23.984 --> 24:26.073
[printer whirring]

25:29.615 --> 25:32.139
[cell phone dialing]

25:34.402 --> 25:35.664
[ringing]

25:42.932 --> 25:44.455
[phone ringing]

25:47.894 --> 25:49.156
Hello?

25:51.680 --> 25:53.508
Hello.

25:54.944 --> 25:56.206
Hello?

25:56.250 --> 26:00.036
Hi. Uh, can you hear me?

26:00.080 --> 26:01.472
Yes. Who is this?

26:02.561 --> 26:04.258
This is Nancy, um...

26:04.301 --> 26:06.739
Who? I think you might have
the wrong number.

26:06.782 --> 26:10.525
I know this is weird, because, uh,
you don't know who I am, but...

26:10.569 --> 26:13.572
Look, if you're selling something,
I'm not interested. Thank you.

26:15.748 --> 26:16.879
[sighs]

26:16.923 --> 26:18.794
[phone ringing]

26:22.624 --> 26:23.625
Yes?

26:23.669 --> 26:25.279
I just, I wanted to talk to you

26:25.322 --> 26:27.281
about your daughter.

26:27.324 --> 26:29.084
If you're calling about
the scholarship fund,

26:29.108 --> 26:30.805
you can visit the website.

26:32.460 --> 26:34.593
No, it's not...
It's not about that.

26:35.681 --> 26:37.421
Excuse me, who is this?

26:37.465 --> 26:40.163
I think, I just, I think
that I have some information

26:40.207 --> 26:41.382
about your daughter.

26:42.775 --> 26:44.254
What the hell
are you talking about?

26:44.298 --> 26:46.256
I just... I think that, um,

26:46.300 --> 26:48.519
I think that I might be
your daughter, Brooke.

26:51.087 --> 26:53.307
What kind of sick joke
is this? Who is this?

26:53.350 --> 26:55.396
It's not a joke.
My name is Nancy and -

26:55.439 --> 26:59.095
Nancy Freeman was the name
that was my given name,

26:59.139 --> 27:00.923
but I think that
my mother might've...

27:02.359 --> 27:04.753
kidnapped me 30 years ago.

27:11.804 --> 27:13.980
[breathing heavily]

27:15.764 --> 27:18.027
[phone ringing]

27:23.119 --> 27:25.121
Please, just stay on the line.

27:27.776 --> 27:29.648
You need to explain.

27:31.084 --> 27:33.260
I saw you on the TV and, um,

27:33.303 --> 27:36.437
I saw a photograph
of Brooke on the TV,

27:36.480 --> 27:39.570
and, [sighs]

27:39.614 --> 27:43.444
I can't even explain it. I just,
it was like looking in a mirror.

27:43.487 --> 27:46.665
And we look really similar.

27:48.797 --> 27:50.320
And there's just

27:50.364 --> 27:53.019
it would explain a lot of things
in my life, like,

27:54.716 --> 27:56.849
I always felt like
my mom hated me.

27:58.067 --> 28:00.766
How do I believe you?

28:00.809 --> 28:03.072
I don't know. I don't know.

28:03.116 --> 28:05.161
How do you know
your mother kidnapped you?

28:05.205 --> 28:08.425
I don't know. I mean,
I don't have any proof.

28:08.469 --> 28:10.558
There's just a lot of little
things that add up.

28:12.038 --> 28:14.649
I want to see
a photo of you... now.

28:16.259 --> 28:18.261
Okay, I can send one
on my cell phone.

28:19.872 --> 28:21.308
Okay, well,

28:21.351 --> 28:23.963
let me give you
my cell phone. [Clears throat]

28:25.268 --> 28:29.882
It's, um, 646-555-0127.

28:29.925 --> 28:32.711
All right, I'll do it right now.

28:32.754 --> 28:34.756
Okay. Bye.

28:44.810 --> 28:45.810
[camera shutter clicks]

28:59.868 --> 29:02.349
[cell phone ringing]

29:05.874 --> 29:07.310
Hello?

29:10.400 --> 29:12.881
As soon as I saw the photo -

29:16.102 --> 29:18.582
I talked to Leo.

29:18.626 --> 29:20.933
We both want to meet you
in person right away.

29:20.976 --> 29:23.805
I can come now. I can come.
It'll take me a few hours.

29:23.849 --> 29:26.025
I come right away.

29:26.068 --> 29:27.678
Leo's in a lot of shock.

29:27.722 --> 29:30.290
He-he thinks we should
talk to the police first.

29:30.333 --> 29:32.988
I just really want to see
you right away.

29:36.557 --> 29:39.908
Okay, well, call me
if you get lost.

29:39.952 --> 29:42.215
- Okay.
- Okay.

29:42.258 --> 29:44.347
- Bye.
- Okay.

29:48.047 --> 29:49.613
[sniffles]

30:06.935 --> 30:08.197
[cat meows]

30:08.241 --> 30:10.243
Hurry up, Paul, we're going.

31:23.707 --> 31:25.361
She's here.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.243
[cat meows]

31:57.089 --> 31:58.307
Hi.

32:07.360 --> 32:10.015
- Hi.
- Hey, you must be Leo.

32:10.058 --> 32:11.538
Thanks for coming so fast.

32:11.581 --> 32:14.323
[Ellen] You must be tired
from your drive.

32:14.367 --> 32:16.543
- [cat meows]
- [Leo] You have a cat.

32:16.586 --> 32:18.849
Yeah, this is Paul.

32:18.893 --> 32:20.416
- [cat meows]
- [chuckles]

32:20.460 --> 32:22.070
Well, here, let me...

32:23.202 --> 32:25.030
All right, come on in.

32:25.073 --> 32:26.640
- Come on.
- Let's go get warm.

32:31.819 --> 32:33.212
Wow.

32:33.255 --> 32:35.214
I didn't know what else to do.
[chuckles]

32:35.257 --> 32:38.347
Uh, can I take your coat?

32:38.391 --> 32:40.088
Oh, yeah.

32:40.132 --> 32:44.049
Um, I'm going to put your cat
right in the hallway here.

32:44.092 --> 32:45.833
Oh, could we let him out?

32:45.876 --> 32:47.791
Because he's been
cooped up for hours.

32:47.835 --> 32:50.751
Oh, uh, Leo has a cat allergy.

32:50.794 --> 32:52.666
You do?

32:52.709 --> 32:55.016
I'll tell you what.
How about if I put him -

32:55.060 --> 32:56.740
I'll let him out in the sunroom,
all right?

32:56.764 --> 32:58.237
This way we can both breathe.

32:58.280 --> 32:59.934
Is that okay?

32:59.978 --> 33:02.241
Here, come on, have a seat.

33:02.284 --> 33:04.547
Yeah, that's okay.

33:04.591 --> 33:06.723
[Ellen] Please, sit down.

33:12.077 --> 33:14.731
Oh, please,
go ahead, take a seat.

33:25.394 --> 33:26.961
[cat meows]

33:35.839 --> 33:38.538
I'm sorry. We're just
still in a lot of shock.

33:38.581 --> 33:41.454
We didn't want to get
the police involved

33:41.497 --> 33:43.934
because we wanted
to meet you first.

33:43.978 --> 33:46.285
Is that okay
if we ask you some questions?

33:46.328 --> 33:48.591
Yeah, of course, yeah.

33:50.376 --> 33:52.943
I mean, how is it possible?

33:55.511 --> 33:58.384
When did you realize
that you were... kidnapped?

33:59.820 --> 34:00.995
Um...

34:03.171 --> 34:05.652
Well...

34:05.695 --> 34:08.437
You know, I'm still trying
to figure it out.

34:08.481 --> 34:11.527
[Leo] Do you remember
being taken, anything?

34:13.120 --> 34:14.679
Well, it's just...
It's all a bit fuzzy.

34:14.704 --> 34:16.706
I remember holding your hand...

34:18.186 --> 34:21.407
and then... losing you.

34:22.668 --> 34:24.975
It was terrifying.

34:25.018 --> 34:27.891
But later I just thought
it was like...

34:27.935 --> 34:29.110
I lost my mom,

34:29.154 --> 34:31.417
my other mom in the mall
for an hour

34:31.460 --> 34:35.159
and that's all I can remember.

34:35.203 --> 34:38.119
Well, it's hard to remember
anything at that age.

34:38.163 --> 34:40.208
[Ellen] Leo is a psychologist.

34:40.252 --> 34:41.818
Oh.

34:42.993 --> 34:44.473
And what do you do?

34:44.516 --> 34:46.606
I'm a professor,
comparative literature.

34:49.174 --> 34:51.654
Yeah, that's great.

34:53.003 --> 34:56.311
So, when exactly
did you start to suspect

34:56.355 --> 34:59.184
that your mother kidnapped you?

34:59.227 --> 35:03.492
Honey, maybe it's a bit much
right away.

35:03.536 --> 35:05.015
Take your time.

35:05.059 --> 35:06.495
It's okay.

35:06.539 --> 35:09.237
Um, right before
she got sick, before she died.

35:10.673 --> 35:13.546
Your mother died?
Your other mother?

35:13.589 --> 35:15.113
Yeah.

35:16.244 --> 35:17.811
And your father?

35:17.854 --> 35:20.466
He left before I was born.

35:24.252 --> 35:27.603
Anyways, um, a few years ago,

35:27.647 --> 35:30.432
I got a job offer in India,

35:30.476 --> 35:32.478
so when it came time to find,

35:32.521 --> 35:35.437
to get a passport, I couldn't
find my birth certificate.

35:35.481 --> 35:39.659
And when I asked her
where it was,

35:39.702 --> 35:42.227
she would always say
it's at my aunts' house.

35:42.270 --> 35:44.968
And, you know, it was lost.

35:47.406 --> 35:49.408
Anyway, so, I lost that job

35:49.451 --> 35:51.714
and, uh, right after that
when I found out

35:51.758 --> 35:53.542
that she had Parkinson's and...

35:57.590 --> 36:00.506
and that's when she told me

36:00.549 --> 36:03.161
that she wasn't
my biological mother.

36:07.252 --> 36:08.644
Okay.

36:13.083 --> 36:15.695
I never felt, like,
a connection to my mom.

36:30.405 --> 36:32.668
Excuse me, can I go
to the bathroom?

36:32.712 --> 36:35.454
Of course. It's just there,
right on your right.

36:35.497 --> 36:37.195
[mumbles, indistinct]

36:41.460 --> 36:42.591
[door closes]

36:46.769 --> 36:48.162
[coughs]

37:07.225 --> 37:09.357
[toilet flushes]

37:15.363 --> 37:16.495
[knocks]

37:16.538 --> 37:18.018
Everything okay?

37:22.370 --> 37:23.632
Nancy?

37:23.676 --> 37:25.460
[Nancy] Yeah, everything's okay.

37:49.223 --> 37:54.054
Nancy, just to get things going,

37:54.097 --> 37:59.364
I've arranged for a private
investigator to come tomorrow.

37:59.407 --> 38:02.976
He'll do a DNA test
and, uh, ask some questions,

38:03.019 --> 38:05.108
- and, in the meantime...
- Leo.

38:07.372 --> 38:10.070
I think the sooner the better
for all of us.

38:13.378 --> 38:15.815
Um, you know, I think

38:15.858 --> 38:18.339
that I should probably
get going anyway,

38:18.383 --> 38:20.103
because I don't want to intrude
or anything.

38:20.127 --> 38:21.453
- [Ellen] Oh, please, stay.
- No, it's all right.

38:21.477 --> 38:23.344
Please, you know,
you should stay the night.

38:23.388 --> 38:25.477
It's too long of a drive,
and we have an extra room.

38:29.219 --> 38:31.483
Well, could...
could Paul come in?

38:33.223 --> 38:34.573
You mean in the house?

38:34.616 --> 38:36.314
Just this once?

38:39.447 --> 38:41.362
Let me think about it.

38:41.406 --> 38:43.606
[Ellen] Nancy, come on.
Let me show you that extra room.

38:43.630 --> 38:45.414
- Come on.
- Okay.

38:47.673 --> 38:49.152
[Ellen] Okay.

39:03.471 --> 39:06.387
Or you could sleep on the
pullout sofa if you'd rather.

39:06.431 --> 39:08.171
No, it's okay.

39:08.215 --> 39:09.738
Okay.

39:11.479 --> 39:14.439
Leo always wanted me
to get rid of all of her stuff,

39:14.482 --> 39:15.788
your stuff.

39:18.660 --> 39:21.271
We keep this room locked
when we have guests.

39:26.451 --> 39:28.453
Um, there's towels here.

39:28.496 --> 39:29.541
Thanks.

39:40.203 --> 39:42.684
I could sleep in here, too,
if you want.

39:44.643 --> 39:47.036
- Okay.
- Okay.

40:14.455 --> 40:17.023
[Ellen] I used to
lie in here for hours.

40:19.068 --> 40:23.072
I convinced myself you were living
with some nice family somewhere.

40:24.509 --> 40:26.946
I'd imagine how long
your hair was,

40:28.687 --> 40:30.428
what your clothes were like,

40:31.777 --> 40:33.431
who your friends were.

40:34.649 --> 40:37.173
I hope you're not disappointed.

40:40.655 --> 40:42.614
Why would you say that?

43:00.055 --> 43:02.188
How did you sleep?

43:02.231 --> 43:04.886
I slept really well, thank you.

43:04.930 --> 43:06.845
I thought you were
going to come in.

43:06.888 --> 43:08.568
- I thought you were...
- Yeah, I meant to.

43:08.592 --> 43:10.715
I guess I just fell really
deeply asleep for a change.

43:10.758 --> 43:12.372
I'm sorry.

43:12.415 --> 43:14.287
You don't have to be sorry.
I'm just...

43:14.330 --> 43:17.159
No, I... I know you're worried.
I know you're worried.

43:37.571 --> 43:40.052
- [cat meows]
- Sorry, Paul.

43:40.095 --> 43:42.402
- Hey.
- [Leo] ...want it to be her.

43:42.445 --> 43:44.273
I mean, I understand that.

43:44.317 --> 43:46.798
You know,
I want it to be her, too, but...

43:46.841 --> 43:48.451
- [Ellen] Do you?
- [cat meows]

43:48.495 --> 43:50.018
What?

43:59.767 --> 44:01.639
[Leo] It looks good.

44:01.682 --> 44:04.467
[Ellen] Oh, it's okay.

44:04.511 --> 44:07.949
Leo, why don't you show Nancy
your photo studio?

44:10.169 --> 44:12.084
Sure. [Clears throat]

44:18.003 --> 44:21.093
They should be
in a gallery or something.

44:21.136 --> 44:23.225
[Leo] No.

44:23.269 --> 44:25.793
I mean, it's really
just a hobby.

44:25.837 --> 44:27.186
I'm not that good.

44:28.753 --> 44:31.669
I got my first camera
when Brooke was born.

44:33.801 --> 44:36.848
You know, I have some
old photos, I think, in here.

44:57.825 --> 44:59.305
Four years old.

45:00.393 --> 45:02.830
Look-look really happy.

45:09.184 --> 45:12.666
I used to look at these all
the time so I wouldn't forget.

45:17.845 --> 45:20.761
Ah, do you remember the lake?

45:20.805 --> 45:22.502
You used to...

45:22.545 --> 45:25.853
Well, I would take Brooke there
every day in the summer.

45:29.639 --> 45:33.861
Well, keep looking. Maybe
something will jog your memory.

45:43.915 --> 45:45.917
Do you mind
if I take your photo?

45:47.005 --> 45:49.094
Um...

45:50.748 --> 45:52.793
Oh, okay.

45:52.837 --> 45:54.273
Yeah?

45:55.491 --> 45:57.276
All right, just look at me.

45:57.319 --> 46:00.888
Just move the chair a
little bit towards the window.

46:04.022 --> 46:06.764
Good, good.

46:08.896 --> 46:10.811
[camera shutter clicks]

46:13.074 --> 46:15.163
Look at me a little bit more.

46:18.079 --> 46:21.126
I'm not very photogenic.

46:21.169 --> 46:22.736
Sure, you are.

46:22.780 --> 46:25.695
That's nice, just relax.
Look at me.

46:27.872 --> 46:29.177
I'm not...

46:30.396 --> 46:31.832
[camera shutter clicks]

46:35.880 --> 46:38.317
- More?
- No, no, I'm good. Thanks.

46:38.360 --> 46:40.972
- Nancy?
- [knock on door]

46:42.321 --> 46:44.149
[Leo] Must be the PI.

46:54.333 --> 46:55.638
- [man] Mr. Lynch?
- Yes.

46:55.682 --> 46:58.641
- Hi. I'm Jake from ICP.
- Hi, come on in.

47:00.382 --> 47:02.907
So, I'm just going to ask you
a few questions

47:02.950 --> 47:05.150
and then I'm going to take
a sample of everyone's saliva

47:05.174 --> 47:07.215
to make sure that you are
Brooke Lynch.

47:07.259 --> 47:10.175
Otherwise, the police
can't reopen the case. Okay?

47:10.218 --> 47:12.917
So, your...
Your name is Nancy Freeman?

47:12.960 --> 47:14.919
- Yeah.
- Okay.

47:14.962 --> 47:18.923
And, um, your mother, the one
who raised you, her name?

47:18.966 --> 47:20.925
Betty Freeman.

47:20.968 --> 47:25.190
Now, Mr. Lynch mentioned that
she is now deceased, correct?

47:25.233 --> 47:27.757
- Yes.
- Okay, when did she pass?

47:27.801 --> 47:29.934
Um...

47:29.977 --> 47:31.326
about a week ago.

47:32.893 --> 47:34.416
What?

47:34.460 --> 47:37.376
Well, she, I mean, she was sick
for a really long time,

47:37.419 --> 47:40.379
then she... she had a stroke
and died.

47:43.904 --> 47:46.080
[Jake] And your...
Your mother, Betty,

47:46.124 --> 47:49.954
did she ever confess to a
kidnapping or anything like that?

47:49.997 --> 47:53.914
Well, she said that she'd adopted
me from her distant cousin.

47:53.958 --> 47:55.742
Distant cousin?

47:55.785 --> 47:57.918
Did you ever meet this cousin?
Do you know his name?

48:00.007 --> 48:01.139
No.

48:07.406 --> 48:11.062
- I need a copy of your driver's license, please, Nancy.
- Yeah.

48:18.591 --> 48:20.941
[Jake] Take a quick picture.

48:20.985 --> 48:22.987
- Let's see here.
- [camera shutter clicks]

48:23.030 --> 48:25.990
- Beautiful. Thank you.
- [Nancy] Thanks.

48:26.033 --> 48:29.950
All right, so I'm going to
take those saliva samples now.

48:29.994 --> 48:32.561
Okay. Who wants to go first?
Mr. Lynch?

48:34.520 --> 48:37.915
All right. Just open your mouth
a little for me.

48:39.264 --> 48:41.092
There we go.

48:41.135 --> 48:43.181
That easy. Okay.

48:47.489 --> 48:49.230
Okay, Mrs. Lynch.

48:53.365 --> 48:55.149
Beautiful.

48:56.716 --> 48:58.587
All right,

48:58.631 --> 49:00.154
and last but not least.

49:02.069 --> 49:03.375
Open up.

49:06.856 --> 49:10.034
The results should be ready in
about two or three business days.

49:10.077 --> 49:12.036
Is there any way to expedite it?

49:12.079 --> 49:14.952
[Jake] I'm sorry, that's the
fastest the lab can process it.

49:14.995 --> 49:17.998
It's already been expedited given
the extreme nature of this case.

49:18.042 --> 49:19.434
I see.

49:21.132 --> 49:23.221
- [Leo] Thank you for coming.
- [Jake] Of course.

49:23.264 --> 49:25.092
Oh, and, uh,

49:25.136 --> 49:28.966
if you have any questions,
here, let me give you my card.

49:30.750 --> 49:32.099
There you go.

49:32.143 --> 49:34.058
Feel free to
reach out anytime. Okay?

49:34.101 --> 49:36.495
- Thank you.
- [Jake] Okay.

49:38.062 --> 49:39.106
Take care.

49:45.112 --> 49:46.548
[Leo] Thank you.

49:56.994 --> 49:58.908
Maybe we should do something.

50:02.173 --> 50:03.304
Thanks.

50:04.392 --> 50:06.568
I'll get us a catalog.

50:21.148 --> 50:24.673
You know, she's been waiting for
Brooke for a really long time.

50:30.505 --> 50:32.377
What about you?

50:32.420 --> 50:36.250
Well, of course, but I-I just
don't want to see her get hurt.

50:36.294 --> 50:40.385
A girl was found 20 years ago,
ended up being a false alarm.

50:56.183 --> 50:57.924
[whispers] Ellen,

50:59.317 --> 51:01.971
I don't think that Leo likes me.

51:03.060 --> 51:04.583
[softly] Why would you say that?

51:06.324 --> 51:09.240
He just has a hard shell,
that's all.

51:54.241 --> 51:57.636
Do you remember when we first moved
in here and she stepped on a nail?

51:57.679 --> 51:59.812
Oh, God, that was terrifying.

52:01.509 --> 52:04.208
We were renovating and
you stepped right on a nail.

52:04.251 --> 52:06.253
We had to rush you
to the hospital.

52:06.297 --> 52:08.864
I wonder if she still
has a scar.

52:08.908 --> 52:11.084
It's probably gone by now.

52:11.128 --> 52:13.260
[Leo] Well,
she did get stitches.

52:13.304 --> 52:15.567
What, I still have scars
from when I was little.

52:15.610 --> 52:17.177
She doesn't have to show us.

52:17.221 --> 52:19.788
Well, which foot was on?
Do you remember?

52:19.832 --> 52:21.225
No.

52:21.268 --> 52:23.270
It was your left.

52:23.314 --> 52:24.663
Let me have look.

52:29.407 --> 52:31.713
Oh, yeah, is that it?

52:31.757 --> 52:33.715
Uh, I don't think so.

52:35.282 --> 52:37.197
You know what, maybe it was
your other foot.

52:37.241 --> 52:39.199
[Nancy] We can have a look
at my right foot.

52:51.080 --> 52:53.344
Shirley Jackson.

52:53.387 --> 52:55.607
Yeah, I teach her work
in my class.

52:55.650 --> 52:57.478
You do?

52:57.522 --> 52:59.654
She's one of
my favorite authors.

53:02.091 --> 53:03.832
This is you? You wrote this?

53:03.876 --> 53:07.967
Yeah, that was my thesis
in grad school.

53:09.229 --> 53:10.274
Wow.

53:10.317 --> 53:11.710
Mm. Not really. [Chuckles]

53:11.753 --> 53:13.842
I haven't published
anything since.

53:13.886 --> 53:15.496
Why not?

53:17.063 --> 53:20.240
I-I tried to write about
your disappearing.

53:20.284 --> 53:24.288
First, it was a memoir.
Then, it was fiction.

53:24.331 --> 53:26.377
See those?

53:26.420 --> 53:29.423
Those are all
the unfinished versions.

53:29.467 --> 53:30.816
Can I read one of them?

53:32.339 --> 53:34.472
Well, they're kind of a mess.

53:34.515 --> 53:36.343
No one has ever seen them.

53:43.350 --> 53:46.310
Do you think you could read
one of my stories?

53:47.833 --> 53:49.400
I didn't know you wrote.

53:49.443 --> 53:51.532
They're not that good
or anything.

53:51.576 --> 53:53.317
I bet that's not true.

53:53.360 --> 53:57.495
Well, I mean, I'm not like
a professional like you are.

53:57.538 --> 53:59.932
I bet there's a reason
you became a writer.

54:01.977 --> 54:04.284
I'd like to read
one of your stories.

54:04.328 --> 54:05.851
Could I?

54:07.853 --> 54:10.247
Yeah, okay,
I can email you something.

54:34.009 --> 54:36.577
[Ellen] Leo, these records
are so random.

54:36.621 --> 54:38.318
- [chuckles]
- [Leo] They're what?

54:38.362 --> 54:40.799
They're so random.
How did we end up with this?

54:40.842 --> 54:45.586
I took all those records back about
five years ago to the flea market

54:45.630 --> 54:48.372
and then, somehow,
they ended up back in the house.

54:48.415 --> 54:50.548
[Ellen] Yeah,
I went and rebought them

54:50.591 --> 54:53.768
without realizing, and yet I don't
know how he had them to begin with.

54:53.812 --> 54:56.293
[chuckles] You know?
Would you like anymore wine?

54:56.336 --> 54:58.469
Uh... No, I'm fine.

54:59.687 --> 55:01.994
Oh, um, Leo,

55:02.037 --> 55:04.562
Nancy sent me... uh,
emailed me a story she wrote.

55:04.605 --> 55:06.433
Can we print it out and read it?

55:06.477 --> 55:08.827
Oh, right now?

55:08.870 --> 55:10.394
Yeah, come on, please.

55:10.437 --> 55:12.483
Um, yeah.

55:19.403 --> 55:21.013
[Ellen] Can't wait.

55:23.232 --> 55:25.104
[printer whirring]

55:45.690 --> 55:48.127
- Slow, slow, quick, quick,
- [music playing]

55:48.170 --> 55:50.434
- Slow, slow.
- Hang on,

55:50.477 --> 55:53.045
- you're, like, going backwards.
- Yeah, that's right.

55:53.088 --> 55:56.788
- Slow, slow, quick, quick, slow.
- [laughing]

55:56.831 --> 55:59.747
Slow, slow, quick.

55:59.791 --> 56:01.532
- I'm not very good.
- No, I'm not either.

56:01.575 --> 56:03.098
I don't know what I'm doing.

56:03.142 --> 56:04.796
[laughing]

56:08.365 --> 56:11.063
You want to help me
with this? Come here.

56:11.106 --> 56:12.543
Sure.

56:13.935 --> 56:16.634
- You show us.
- I don't know.

56:24.511 --> 56:25.947
[laughing]

57:06.771 --> 57:08.163
You have a way with writing.

57:12.472 --> 57:14.866
Reminds me of Joan Didion,
right?

57:14.909 --> 57:16.694
- Yeah.
- I feel like, um,

57:16.737 --> 57:19.958
Play It As It Lays
or Run Rivermaybe.

57:20.001 --> 57:23.091
Didn't read that one, but yeah.

57:23.135 --> 57:25.529
Have you ever tried
to get anything published?

57:25.572 --> 57:27.531
Yeah, everywhere.

57:27.574 --> 57:29.968
Well, you can't just give up.

57:31.752 --> 57:34.189
I know a couple of editors
in New York I could send it to.

57:35.277 --> 57:36.583
Really?

57:38.455 --> 57:39.847
You don't have to.

57:39.891 --> 57:42.546
Well, I think
you really have talent.

57:45.810 --> 57:48.508
Of course, I might be
a little biased.

58:10.051 --> 58:12.140
- Hey.
- Hi.

58:15.056 --> 58:16.928
[Ellen] I found this.

58:18.277 --> 58:19.800
[chuckles]

58:19.844 --> 58:22.847
I used to play that for you
every night at bedtime.

58:24.283 --> 58:25.893
Yeah?

58:29.418 --> 58:30.855
[chiming]

58:33.858 --> 58:35.512
Thanks.

58:37.644 --> 58:40.386
Did you mean what you said?

58:40.429 --> 58:41.518
About what?

58:41.561 --> 58:43.563
About having talent?

58:43.607 --> 58:45.217
Of course, I did.

58:46.740 --> 58:48.873
I wouldn't lie about that.

58:48.916 --> 58:52.354
But, like, how do you know?

58:52.398 --> 58:53.921
I don't know.

58:55.662 --> 58:58.447
I mean, you really bring
the reader into your world.

58:58.491 --> 59:00.667
Even though it's
a different world.

59:01.886 --> 59:04.845
Your writing is-is raw.

59:04.889 --> 59:08.370
I mean, there's grammatical errors but
you really know how to tell a story.

59:10.808 --> 59:12.723
You have writing at school?

59:12.766 --> 59:17.379
No. I had a few semesters
at community college but...

59:19.077 --> 59:21.122
I always had to
look after ma and,

59:21.166 --> 59:22.646
you know,
we didn't have any money.

59:24.604 --> 59:27.128
You really don't know
anything about your father?

59:27.172 --> 59:28.739
Hmm-mm.

59:28.782 --> 59:30.958
I remember ma used to
have a lot of boyfriends

59:31.002 --> 59:35.223
and she would sometimes ask
them to read to me at bedtime.

59:38.705 --> 59:44.189
And... the drunk ones would,
like, fall asleep in my bedroom.

59:48.585 --> 59:50.674
I'm so sorry...

59:50.717 --> 59:52.632
I wasn't there.

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.936
[cat meows]

01:01:21.982 --> 01:01:23.767
Paul.

01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:25.203
[softly] Paul!

01:01:28.815 --> 01:01:30.861
[shouting] Paul!

01:01:30.904 --> 01:01:32.732
Paul!

01:01:32.776 --> 01:01:34.516
[softly] Paul, come here.

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:35.953
Paul.

01:01:37.824 --> 01:01:39.783
[shouting] Paul!

01:01:40.871 --> 01:01:42.524
Paul!

01:01:46.267 --> 01:01:47.573
Nancy?

01:01:48.661 --> 01:01:49.923
What are you doing?

01:01:49.967 --> 01:01:52.186
Paul's run away.

01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:54.972
Nancy, it's freezing out here.
Come inside.

01:01:55.015 --> 01:01:56.558
- Paul's run away!
- We'll look for him in the morning.

01:01:56.582 --> 01:01:58.022
We can't look
for him in the morning.

01:01:58.046 --> 01:01:58.932
He's a house cat.

01:01:58.976 --> 01:02:02.762
Um, Nancy, it's 4 AM.

01:02:02.806 --> 01:02:05.722
Come inside. We'll put some food out.
He'll come back.

01:02:05.765 --> 01:02:07.898
What do you...
What do you know about cats?

01:02:07.941 --> 01:02:10.422
I grew up with cats.
They always come back.

01:02:16.297 --> 01:02:18.822
Come inside.
Try to go back to sleep.

01:02:18.865 --> 01:02:20.475
We'll find him in the morning.

01:02:32.487 --> 01:02:34.359
- I'm sorry.
- [door opens]

01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:28.603
Paul?

01:04:37.003 --> 01:04:38.352
Paul?

01:04:44.010 --> 01:04:45.882
Paul?

01:04:53.672 --> 01:04:55.021
Nancy?

01:05:02.289 --> 01:05:03.900
Paul?

01:05:05.989 --> 01:05:06.989
Paul?

01:05:11.908 --> 01:05:13.692
Paul?

01:05:44.375 --> 01:05:46.246
[crying] Nancy?

01:05:48.683 --> 01:05:50.598
Nancy?

01:05:54.428 --> 01:05:55.995
Nancy?

01:06:00.869 --> 01:06:02.523
Nancy?

01:06:13.099 --> 01:06:16.059
Nancy, where were you?

01:06:17.147 --> 01:06:19.192
I was looking for Paul.

01:06:19.236 --> 01:06:21.636
You shouldn't be out in the woods
without your proper colors.

01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:23.980
It's hunting season.

01:06:24.023 --> 01:06:25.720
Let's go inside.

01:06:27.244 --> 01:06:29.376
He'll come back. Trust me.

01:06:42.868 --> 01:06:45.523
Did there used to be
a tree house out back?

01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:51.398
Yeah.

01:06:52.486 --> 01:06:54.140
How did you know?

01:06:54.184 --> 01:06:58.275
Well, when I was out there
I remember... playing in it.

01:07:03.106 --> 01:07:05.151
I built it for you.

01:07:07.066 --> 01:07:08.154
[chuckles softly]

01:07:10.374 --> 01:07:11.374
[cat meows]

01:07:12.376 --> 01:07:13.986
Paul!

01:07:15.335 --> 01:07:18.121
Hey, he's back.

01:07:18.164 --> 01:07:19.687
Paul. Hey.

01:07:21.167 --> 01:07:22.560
Paul.

01:07:24.127 --> 01:07:26.129
You were right.

01:07:26.172 --> 01:07:28.131
Paul, you're so cold.

01:07:28.174 --> 01:07:30.307
- [meows]
- I'm going to get you home.

01:07:30.350 --> 01:07:31.960
What, you're leaving now?

01:07:32.004 --> 01:07:33.644
[Nancy] Yeah, well,
I should get him home,

01:07:33.668 --> 01:07:35.138
and you guys
have been so generous.

01:07:35.181 --> 01:07:36.748
No, please, please stay.

01:07:36.791 --> 01:07:39.142
Maybe we could take a walk.

01:07:39.185 --> 01:07:40.404
We could show her the lake.

01:07:40.447 --> 01:07:42.188
You're welcome to stay.

01:07:44.408 --> 01:07:46.932
- Okay.
- Sorry.

01:07:46.975 --> 01:07:49.065
[sneezes]

01:07:49.108 --> 01:07:52.068
I can... I can put him, uh,
in his carrier if you'd like.

01:07:53.199 --> 01:07:54.635
No, you know what,

01:07:54.679 --> 01:07:57.116
why don't you
put him in your room.

01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:58.378
Just keep the door shut.

01:07:58.422 --> 01:08:00.250
Yeah?

01:08:03.079 --> 01:08:05.429
[chuckles] All right.

01:08:05.472 --> 01:08:08.519
[Leo] Why don't you two go. I'm just
going to stay here and clean up.

01:08:08.562 --> 01:08:10.260
Thank you, sweetie.

01:08:25.013 --> 01:08:26.798
[phone ringing]

01:08:28.191 --> 01:08:30.193
- [phone beeps on]
- [Ellen] Hello?

01:08:30.236 --> 01:08:32.846
Oh, Mr. Zandia. Hi.

01:08:35.241 --> 01:08:37.113
You have the results already?

01:08:42.205 --> 01:08:43.902
Oh.

01:08:45.381 --> 01:08:47.732
Are you... are you sure?

01:08:52.084 --> 01:08:54.738
Okay. Thank, oh, thank you.

01:08:56.131 --> 01:08:57.742
Goodbye.

01:08:57.785 --> 01:08:59.135
[phone beeps off]

01:09:38.652 --> 01:09:40.611
[sobbing]

01:09:58.629 --> 01:10:00.587
[footsteps approaching]

01:10:57.688 --> 01:11:00.430
We used to come here a lot
when Brooke was little.

01:11:03.346 --> 01:11:05.130
She loved the water.

01:11:08.394 --> 01:11:11.397
The day that Brooke
went missing,

01:11:11.441 --> 01:11:14.095
do you know why
she let go of my hand?

01:11:16.054 --> 01:11:18.404
She saw a kitten
in the pet store.

01:11:20.101 --> 01:11:22.016
She had wanted one
for Christmas.

01:11:23.409 --> 01:11:25.846
As soon as she saw it
she ran right off.

01:11:25.890 --> 01:11:29.285
[crying] She just slipped
right out of my hand.

01:11:31.287 --> 01:11:33.985
When I got to the pet store
I couldn't find her,

01:11:34.028 --> 01:11:35.900
and I looked all over the mall.

01:11:35.943 --> 01:11:39.295
And I kept going back
and back to the pet store.

01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:43.124
She was gone.

01:11:49.696 --> 01:11:51.872
It wasn't your fault.

01:12:05.930 --> 01:12:07.279
[distant gunshot]

01:12:10.326 --> 01:12:13.329
It's the hunters.
We should get going.

01:12:25.471 --> 01:12:27.299
[man] Hey, stop!

01:12:31.172 --> 01:12:34.001
I-I need your phone. We need...

01:12:34.045 --> 01:12:36.917
We-we need...
We need an ambulance.

01:12:38.919 --> 01:12:41.574
- [mumbling]
- I'll do it. I'll do it.

01:12:45.839 --> 01:12:47.798
Yes, hello, uh,
we have an emergency.

01:12:47.841 --> 01:12:52.280
Um, take us to it. Uh, near,
I think near Birder's Point.

01:12:52.324 --> 01:12:54.935
Um, yes, I think it was
a hunting accident.

01:13:03.857 --> 01:13:05.511
What happened?

01:13:05.555 --> 01:13:08.514
[man] We were hunting and
then there was an accident.

01:13:08.558 --> 01:13:10.429
- What's his name?
- Ben.

01:13:10.473 --> 01:13:14.433
Hey, Ben, hey.
Keep looking at me.

01:13:14.477 --> 01:13:17.654
It's going to be all right.
Hang in there.

01:13:17.697 --> 01:13:19.699
[man] Hey, I need you to
keep your eyes open, okay?

01:13:19.743 --> 01:13:22.485
- Ben, can you please...
- Hey, hey, hey. Hi.

01:13:22.528 --> 01:13:25.836
Just keep him awake. Stay awake.

01:13:27.359 --> 01:13:28.795
Stay awake.

01:13:28.839 --> 01:13:30.971
[man] You need to keep your
eyes open, okay.

01:13:31.015 --> 01:13:32.756
- All right?
- [distant sirens]

01:13:32.799 --> 01:13:34.959
You're not going to tell mom
and dad about this, right?

01:13:34.983 --> 01:13:36.760
Hey.

01:13:36.803 --> 01:13:38.849
- They're coming.
- [grunts faintly]

01:14:25.025 --> 01:14:27.027
[Ellen] Maybe 18 or 19.

01:14:27.071 --> 01:14:28.986
[Leo] No other adults around
or parents?

01:14:29.029 --> 01:14:31.989
No, I didn't see them. No.
It was awful.

01:14:32.032 --> 01:14:33.817
But Nancy was terrific.

01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:35.862
She-she seemed to know
just what to do.

01:14:35.906 --> 01:14:38.517
- She helped stop the bleeding.
- Really?

01:14:38.561 --> 01:14:39.736
Yeah.

01:14:39.779 --> 01:14:42.390
[Leo] Well, I hope he's okay.

01:14:42.434 --> 01:14:44.523
[Nancy] Yeah, we don't know.

01:14:49.223 --> 01:14:51.704
People get taken from you
just like that.

01:14:57.623 --> 01:15:00.496
We have to appreciate
what we have now.

01:15:05.065 --> 01:15:07.024
It's the only thing that's real.

01:15:12.072 --> 01:15:14.379
Shall we have dessert?

01:15:14.422 --> 01:15:16.860
[Leo] Oh, I'm full. What is it?

01:15:16.903 --> 01:15:18.383
Apple crisp.

01:15:18.426 --> 01:15:20.559
- You're killing me.
- [Ellen chuckles]

01:15:20.603 --> 01:15:22.213
- Yeah.
- Nancy?

01:15:23.997 --> 01:15:26.130
It's getting pretty late.
I think, um,

01:15:26.173 --> 01:15:27.784
I'm just gonna go to bed.

01:15:27.827 --> 01:15:29.742
But it's so early.

01:15:29.786 --> 01:15:32.528
Yeah, I'm just,
I'm really tired.

01:15:32.571 --> 01:15:34.747
I'm really, really exhausted.

01:15:41.928 --> 01:15:43.626
I love you.

01:15:45.584 --> 01:15:46.803
No matter what.

01:15:56.116 --> 01:15:58.771
I need to
tell you guys something.

01:16:06.649 --> 01:16:09.652
There are things
that you don't know,

01:16:09.695 --> 01:16:11.523
that I haven't told you.

01:16:12.698 --> 01:16:14.570
And, um...

01:16:17.007 --> 01:16:18.574
And I want to tell you.

01:16:20.663 --> 01:16:22.186
I know I'm...

01:16:22.229 --> 01:16:24.492
I know you've been
through a lot.

01:16:25.711 --> 01:16:27.670
It's in your past.

01:16:28.758 --> 01:16:30.150
We're here for you now.

01:16:33.066 --> 01:16:34.764
We'll get through it.

01:16:39.507 --> 01:16:41.858
Why don't you go get some sleep?

01:16:41.901 --> 01:16:44.208
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

01:16:52.433 --> 01:16:54.087
Okay.

01:17:46.792 --> 01:17:48.664
[purring]

01:18:32.055 --> 01:18:34.231
[door creaks]

01:19:13.879 --> 01:19:16.142
