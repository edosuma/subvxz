Dylan is cheating on
her. Some has to tell Karma.

We're done.

00:06.838 --> 00:08.505
Everyone's talking about your video.

00:08.507 --> 00:10.473
At least I didn't
abandon my best friend.

00:10.475 --> 00:13.143
You forced me to kiss
you over and over again,

00:13.145 --> 00:14.594
and then you rejected me!

00:29.377 --> 00:30.827
Mom, it's fine.

00:30.829 --> 00:32.746
I learned a lot about
refinishing furniture

You're tryin' to distract yourself
from missing Karma.

This is about creating better workflow.

00:57.522 --> 00:58.772
Who'd you piss off now?

00:58.774 --> 01:00.106
New Lisbeth tweeted

01:00.108 --> 01:02.575
that Elisabeth
Hasselbeck is my spirit animal.

01:02.577 --> 01:04.027
True as that may be, it's also offensive

01:04.029 --> 01:05.995

American peoples, apparently.

01:05.997 --> 01:07.497

01:07.499 --> 01:10.583
Lauren, she's standing right there.

01:10.585 --> 01:12.669
No, I'm talking about old New Lisbeth.

01:12.671 --> 01:14.337
This is new New Lisbeth.

01:14.339 --> 01:17.173
Okay. Brainstorm time, girls.

01:17.175 --> 01:18.458

We can follow you with cameras,

01:26.468 --> 01:28.635

01:28.637 --> 01:30.720
People love seeing inside the
lives of public figures.

01:30.722 --> 01:32.605
When do we start?

01:35.477 --> 01:37.477
Karma, we have something

01:37.479 --> 01:39.646
we think is going to cheer you up.

01:39.648 --> 01:40.897
Look what we found unpacking

01:40.899 --> 01:43.399
the last of the boxes from storage.

you and Amy back together.

01:50.876 --> 01:53.576
Sorry, but I don't
believe in signs anymore.

01:53.578 --> 01:54.994
And even if I did, look at this.

01:54.996 --> 01:57.046
It's a half-broken
heart with jagged edges.

01:57.048 --> 01:59.165
If anything, we were
destined to be torn apart.

Sensing a lot of sublimated
emotions right now.

02:02.637 --> 02:03.837
We could talk through those.

02:03.839 --> 02:05.338
Oh, I can get the therapy puppets.

02:05.340 --> 02:06.973
No. Please, no puppets.

02:06.975 --> 02:09.058
Because there is no
hope, and I've accepted that.

02:35.871 --> 02:37.537
That simple enough?

02:37.539 --> 02:39.339
I got two cameras from the AV club

02:39.341 --> 02:41.591
that will work great with
the hand-held setups,

02:41.593 --> 02:44.043

So good to see you
again after this summer.

03:12.574 --> 03:14.073
Did you have a good one?

03:14.075 --> 03:15.909
Well, I spent it in
rehab, so there's that.

03:15.911 --> 03:18.745
Oh, that sounds so relaxing.

03:18.747 --> 03:21.881
Maybe I need rehab. [laughing]

03:37.816 --> 03:40.817
Hey, um, do you have any plans tonight?

03:40.819 --> 03:42.819
Oh, so, listen. About that.

03:42.821 --> 03:45.571
I'm actually not
supposed to date anyone...

03:45.573 --> 03:47.440
six months from my
sober date, to be exact.

03:47.442 --> 03:49.442

04:01.206 --> 04:03.289
Oh, but you were on such a roll.

04:03.291 --> 04:05.291

07:37.138 --> 07:39.005
to let others know what
they're going through.

07:39.007 --> 07:40.173

So, the two bands joining the battle

08:33.227 --> 08:34.727
right here tomorrow night

08:34.729 --> 08:37.897
are "Noah's Ark" and..

08:37.899 --> 08:39.982
"Zee and Zim?"

08:39.984 --> 08:42.400
- Whoa! Oh, my...
- [squealing]

08:42.403 --> 08:43.903
We're not married to the name.

08:43.905 --> 08:45.488
I had no idea this was a qualifier.

08:45.490 --> 08:47.540
Shane. I have so many song ideas.

08:47.542 --> 08:48.741
I... I have to get them down.

08:48.743 --> 08:50.743
Go. Write. You're welcome.

08:50.745 --> 08:52.245
Wow. Karma.

08:52.247 --> 08:53.746
You've gotten even better.

08:53.748 --> 08:55.998
You got to save some
talent for the rest of us.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.250
Thank you.

08:57.252 --> 09:00.219
That means a lot.

09:00.221 --> 09:03.172
Hey, um, you should come tomorrow night.

09:03.174 --> 09:06.425
It'd be nice to have a
friendly face in the crowd.

09:06.427 --> 09:09.262
- Cool.
- Cool.

09:10.932 --> 09:13.316
- It sounded really good, man.
- Song's amazing.

09:13.318 --> 09:16.269
Hey, you were really good up there.

09:16.271 --> 09:18.487
I couldn't take my eyes off you.

09:18.489 --> 09:19.939
Oh, well, same.

09:19.941 --> 09:21.274
- Shane.
- Noah.

09:21.276 --> 09:23.409
Oh, you must be "Noah's Ark," right?

09:23.411 --> 09:26.112
So, I guess we'll be
seeing each other again tomorrow.

09:26.114 --> 09:28.197
I look forward to

09:28.199 --> 09:30.950
looking at you again, and good luck.

09:30.952 --> 09:32.501
Thanks.

09:32.503 --> 09:35.371
And this is the part where
you say "good luck" back.

09:35.373 --> 09:38.291
It's gonna take a lot more
than luck for you to win.

09:38.293 --> 09:40.876
Why is that? You
think you're better than me?

09:40.878 --> 09:42.128
No.

09:42.130 --> 09:44.297
Because I think you're better than her.

09:44.299 --> 09:46.299
You should be the one in the front.

09:46.301 --> 09:49.852
At least, if you really
want us to swoon for you.

09:49.854 --> 09:53.306

09:58.093 --> 09:59.292
- Hey.
- Oh!

09:59.294 --> 10:00.460
I'm so happy you're here early.

10:00.462 --> 10:03.263
Um, I wanted your
opinions on some new ideas.

10:03.265 --> 10:05.682
Uh-huh, opinions. I'm full of them.

10:05.684 --> 10:08.218
But first, we should
have a higher level convo.

10:08.220 --> 10:09.853
"Higher level?" What does that mean?

10:09.855 --> 10:11.304
So it has come to my attention

10:11.306 --> 10:14.140
that this contest is
on a much bigger stage,

10:14.142 --> 10:17.477
which means to win, we'll
need a much bigger sound.

10:17.479 --> 10:18.478
But never fear.

10:18.480 --> 10:21.147
I've already done all the work.

10:24.219 --> 10:27.487
Um, this is a cover. With a full band.

10:27.489 --> 10:30.290
I'm basically the
back-up singer in this.

10:30.292 --> 10:32.075
Well, yeah, you're a little bit country,

10:32.077 --> 10:34.294
and I'm a little bit
more "Glam Rock God."

10:34.296 --> 10:36.296
Trust. This is the best way.

10:36.298 --> 10:38.965
Let's see what we can
do to jooj up your look.

10:38.967 --> 10:41.968
- Yeah.
- [sighs]

10:41.970 --> 10:43.386
What the [bleep]?

10:43.388 --> 10:45.889
That bitch can't talk
that [bleep] on me.

10:45.891 --> 10:48.558
Dial back the language. We're
going for Bravo, not TLC.

10:48.560 --> 10:51.478
I can't believe Leila said
that. You should confront her.

10:51.480 --> 10:53.563
Holding in those feelings can be toxic.

10:54.850 --> 10:56.016
Ugh, Leila's early.

Lisbeth, go see who it is!

11:00.522 --> 11:01.855
Okay. Okay.

11:01.857 --> 11:03.023
Why does she keep doing that?

11:03.025 --> 11:04.574
So this is the big fight scene.

11:04.576 --> 11:06.693
After some heated
exchange, I'll step in as peacemaker,

11:06.695 --> 11:09.863
teaching my followers a
valuable lesson in diplomacy.

11:09.865 --> 11:11.831
Lauren. Hi, I'm Raven.

11:11.833 --> 11:13.416
It's so nice to finally meet you.

11:13.418 --> 11:15.118
We watch the video of your Hester speech

11:15.120 --> 11:16.836
at the office at least once a day.

11:16.838 --> 11:18.204
Amy?

11:18.206 --> 11:20.173
I reached out to Raven
at Interact last night.

11:20.175 --> 11:23.209
You know, so you can
connect with your intersex community

11:23.211 --> 11:27.097
while the cameras are rolling.

11:27.099 --> 11:28.715
Is that a problem?

11:28.717 --> 11:30.800
Why would that be a problem?

11:30.802 --> 11:32.636
Where are my manners? Raven.

11:32.638 --> 11:34.521
Won't you please join me for a chat?

11:34.523 --> 11:36.139
Absolutely. Yeah.

11:44.449 --> 11:47.284
Hey.

11:47.286 --> 11:48.652
You okay?

11:48.654 --> 11:50.654
Come on, don't be nervous.

11:50.656 --> 11:51.905
Why would I be?

11:51.907 --> 11:54.541
I mean, I'm barely even
in the band anymore.

11:54.543 --> 11:56.376
Shane thinks we need a
different sound to win.

11:56.378 --> 11:58.328
[sighs] He's probably right.

11:58.330 --> 12:00.413
Shane's probably just trying
to impress that guy.

12:00.415 --> 12:02.248
Of course. Vintage Shane.

12:02.250 --> 12:03.833
Why should I expect anything less?

12:03.835 --> 12:05.302
Forget Shane.

12:05.304 --> 12:07.721
Do not let him stand on
your shoulders to stand out.

12:07.723 --> 12:09.306
'Cause the Karma I know

12:09.308 --> 12:12.092

12:21.937 --> 12:24.654
I'm sorry.

12:24.656 --> 12:25.855
Actually, you know what?

12:25.857 --> 12:27.357
I don't want to apologize for that.

12:27.359 --> 12:29.442
I still feel like there's
something there between us,

12:29.444 --> 12:31.444
and can you honestly say
that you don't feel that?

12:31.446 --> 12:33.913
Now, please welcome to
the stage, "Zee and Zim."

12:33.915 --> 12:35.582
Okay, go. Have your moment.

12:35.584 --> 12:37.751
And then after, if you
think it's our moment,

12:37.753 --> 12:40.453
then meet me back here
and we'll figure it out.

13:05.564 --> 13:07.280
Oh, but, the whole concept of normal

13:07.282 --> 13:08.481
is so subjective, you know?

13:08.483 --> 13:09.899
What does it really even mean?

13:09.901 --> 13:12.235
You know, normal.

intersex spokesperson.

No, in fact, I never said that.

No, I don't want to be that.

be a leader for anybody?

leader for your people?

14:20.402 --> 14:21.852

18:20.094 --> 18:22.144
What!

18:25.483 --> 18:27.900
[sighs] Okay.

18:27.902 --> 18:31.020
So... yeah.

18:31.022 --> 18:34.356
Maybe I am afraid to open up.

18:34.358 --> 18:38.861
Maybe I'm scared to face reality.

18:38.863 --> 18:42.498
Because ever since I
found out I was born different,

18:42.500 --> 18:47.703
I've done everything I
could to be a normal girl.

18:47.705 --> 18:50.372
But somebody asked me
today what normal even means,

18:50.374 --> 18:52.625
and I didn't have a good answer.

18:55.880 --> 18:57.796
Maybe I need to find one.

18:59.433 --> 19:03.219
- Hey. Have you seen Karma?
- She bolted a while back.

19:11.362 --> 19:14.113
Rachel? Hi.

19:14.115 --> 19:16.282
Uh, what are you still doing here?

19:16.284 --> 19:18.067
Oh, you know,

19:18.069 --> 19:19.568
I'm just, um,

19:19.570 --> 19:22.037
making sure that you're
not stealing from inventory.

19:22.039 --> 19:24.406
I mean, those stir sticks disappear
a little too quick.

19:24.408 --> 19:25.574
You know what I mean?

19:25.576 --> 19:27.960
That's the only reason?

19:27.962 --> 19:29.295
Okay, busted.

19:29.297 --> 19:32.464
You got me red-handed
with my pants down.

19:32.466 --> 19:34.333
Oh my God. Um, okay.

19:34.335 --> 19:36.001
I'm just gonna go for this.

19:36.003 --> 19:37.336
I was hoping that you would be here

19:37.338 --> 19:40.756
so that I could ask you out.

19:40.758 --> 19:45.010
Uh, "totes inappropes" though, right?

19:45.012 --> 19:47.346
But now it's out there, so...

19:47.348 --> 19:49.481
you want to grab coffee sometime?

19:49.483 --> 19:51.267
I'd like that.

19:51.269 --> 19:53.185
As long as it's not the Brew & Chew.

19:53.187 --> 19:54.937
Oh, God no.

19:54.939 --> 19:56.605
Please. Help.

19:56.607 --> 19:58.440
- They told me to come here.
- What's wrong?

19:58.442 --> 20:02.328
Um, my father, Lucas
Ashcroft, he had a heart attack.

20:02.330 --> 20:03.696
[whispers] Please...

20:03.698 --> 20:05.948
They're still working on him.

20:05.950 --> 20:07.116
Wor-Working on him?

20:07.118 --> 20:08.367
Wha-What does that mean?

20:08.369 --> 20:10.419
Is... is he... is he okay?

20:10.421 --> 20:12.087
Let me find a doctor to talk to you.

20:12.089 --> 20:13.289
