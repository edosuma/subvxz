WEBVTT

00:02.402 --> 00:04.438
Preston, just go.

00:04.538 --> 00:06.840
[Danni] Previously on "Sistas".

00:06.940 --> 00:08.609
-Did Pam call you?
-No.

00:08.709 --> 00:10.777
-Nobody knows I'm here.
-Karen, come on.

00:10.878 --> 00:12.346
-[Karen] Hi, Fatima.
-Zac, talk to this girl.

00:12.446 --> 00:14.281
No, you a low-down
bitch for that.

00:14.381 --> 00:15.649
Now you're worrying me.

00:15.749 --> 00:17.518
I had a friend who said
they were being

00:17.618 --> 00:19.152
investigated at the bank.

00:19.253 --> 00:21.889
-Investigated?
-For the robbery.

00:21.989 --> 00:23.257
If this baby is mine,

00:23.357 --> 00:24.458
we're gonna have to
figure this shit out.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.560
Why don't you just go on home?

00:28.128 --> 00:30.497
-Andi.
-Oh, my God!

00:33.834 --> 00:36.503
What are you doing here?

00:37.271 --> 00:39.339
Gary, just--
Go, go, go, go!

00:42.709 --> 00:44.178
What are you doing here?

00:44.278 --> 00:46.747
Remember,
I told you I was coming.

00:46.847 --> 00:50.517
Danni, I can explain.
Uh, um--

00:50.617 --> 00:53.754
I mean, what?
I mean, girl,

00:53.854 --> 00:57.691
never mind all of that.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.793
This, is this safe?

00:59.893 --> 01:02.229
Oh, you know what?

01:04.864 --> 01:06.567
I mean, what the--
What the hell?

01:06.667 --> 01:08.068
Why are you here?

01:08.168 --> 01:10.470
What do you mean why am I here?
I already told you.

01:10.571 --> 01:13.307
You're right.
Okay.

01:13.407 --> 01:17.277
I mean, I see why
you can't let go.

01:17.377 --> 01:19.246
Danni.

01:19.346 --> 01:21.682
I mean, you didn't tell us
that the -- was like that.

01:21.782 --> 01:23.417
He's Nigerian, right?

01:23.517 --> 01:24.484
Yes.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.720
I could try me one of those.

01:26.820 --> 01:29.789
Okay, Danni,
don't start, okay?

01:29.890 --> 01:31.091
I mean, why are you sneaking
around with him?

01:31.191 --> 01:33.360
I am not sneaking
around with him.

01:33.460 --> 01:35.027
-I'm just--
-What?

01:35.128 --> 01:36.430
Do you know what?

01:36.530 --> 01:38.232
I don't have to explain
myself to you right now.

01:38.332 --> 01:40.267
No, you don't have
to explain to me.

01:40.366 --> 01:43.270
The room is doing that for you.

01:43.370 --> 01:47.473
I mean, that's an ass print
on the table.

01:47.574 --> 01:50.077
Is that yours or his?

01:50.176 --> 01:53.814
His? 'Cause you--
Okay. All right. All right.

01:53.914 --> 01:55.549
Okay.

01:55.649 --> 01:56.583
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

01:56.683 --> 01:57.584
Y'all was up against this glass?

01:57.684 --> 01:58.952
All right, Danni.

01:59.051 --> 02:00.954
That's titty prints
on the glass?

02:01.054 --> 02:05.425
You ass out on the balcony?
All right. Okay.

02:05.526 --> 02:07.961
Giving Atlanta the show.

02:08.061 --> 02:09.729
-Are you done?
-That's what I'm talking about.

02:09.830 --> 02:13.133
Oh, gosh. Wow.

02:13.233 --> 02:18.105
Did you name the --,
like mule or no crocha?

02:18.204 --> 02:20.741
No, Danni.
Are you done?

02:20.841 --> 02:23.010
Mm-mm. I got plenty more.

02:23.110 --> 02:24.378
I never could do porno

02:24.478 --> 02:26.313
and I really don't know
how I feel about that.

02:26.413 --> 02:28.248
Okay, how long is this
gonna go now because--

02:28.348 --> 02:30.684
Donkey.
That's what I meant.

02:30.784 --> 02:34.121
I--

02:34.221 --> 02:36.356
What do you want?
Why are you here?

02:36.456 --> 02:38.792
You know, I still don't like
his ass, big -- and all.

02:38.892 --> 02:42.996
Yes, and you've made that very
clear, so what do you want?

02:43.096 --> 02:45.365
And honestly, girl.

02:45.465 --> 02:47.801
-Okay, that is perfect.
-Sit down!

02:47.901 --> 02:48.869
Ow.

02:48.969 --> 02:50.437
I'm not leaving.
He is.

02:50.537 --> 02:51.905
No, he's not.

02:52.005 --> 02:56.376
This little purse hurting you
and that ain't?

02:56.476 --> 03:00.781
Okay. First of all, I'm in a
very vulnerable state right now.

03:00.881 --> 03:03.617
Um, so I'd appreciate your
understanding.

03:03.717 --> 03:07.154
Secondly, I would appreciate it
if you would exit my domain,

03:07.254 --> 03:10.257
so I can continue my
festivities, please.

03:10.357 --> 03:12.893
Andi, I don't care if you go
talk to him.

03:12.993 --> 03:14.828
Feel free, but he's leaving.

03:14.928 --> 03:18.398
No, he's not.
What's going on?

03:18.498 --> 03:23.036
So I still haven't talked to
Sabrina today.

03:23.136 --> 03:25.072
That don't bother you?

03:25.172 --> 03:29.843
Oh, sh-- Um, okay, you're right.

03:29.943 --> 03:31.912
Okay. I'll um, go talk to him.

03:32.012 --> 03:33.881
Mm-mm. Tell both
of them to leave.

03:33.981 --> 03:35.449
Both of them?

03:35.549 --> 03:40.053
That little negro, big negro
ninja warrior he's got there.

03:40.153 --> 03:43.824
Okay.
I will be back.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.125

04:25.365 --> 04:27.067
Oh, you haven't heard?

04:27.167 --> 04:30.337
Look, I didn't come down here
to hear any of your gossip.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.272
Okay, then what are you
coming down here

04:32.372 --> 04:36.143
with all of these queens for?

04:36.243 --> 04:38.212
Have you seen Maurice?

04:38.312 --> 04:40.981
-Oh, shit.
-What?

04:41.081 --> 04:42.382
You don't know.

04:42.482 --> 04:44.284
Okay, dammit Chris,
would you stop being so dramatic

04:44.384 --> 04:47.487
and tell me,
have you seen him or not?

04:47.921 --> 04:50.858
-He's in jail.
-Jail?

04:50.957 --> 04:53.193
Yeah, he's in jail.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.363
-Get the hell out of here.
-No, seriously they--

04:56.463 --> 04:59.499
They arrested him for that
robbery that Que did.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.001
So let me get this right.

05:01.101 --> 05:03.637
Maurice is locked up and Que,

05:03.737 --> 05:06.206
the one who committed
the robbery is out?

05:06.306 --> 05:08.909
-Well, you don't know-
-Dammit, Chris!

05:09.009 --> 05:14.581
Que, he flipped on them
and then he-he gave him up.

05:14.681 --> 05:19.086
Shit. All right,
what jail is he at?

05:19.186 --> 05:21.922
I think it's uh, county,

05:22.022 --> 05:25.626
but you know, it's federal,
right, so it's not good.

05:25.726 --> 05:28.529
Dammit. I told him
not to mess with dude.

05:28.629 --> 05:31.498
I know.

05:31.598 --> 05:34.301
And he got the nerve to be up
in Maurice's apartment.

05:34.401 --> 05:36.336
Wait--
Wait, what?

05:36.436 --> 05:38.906
Yeah, he's at Maurice's
apartment right now.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.441
Oh, that is so low down.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.877
That's all right.
I'm gonna kick his ass out.

05:43.977 --> 05:47.080
Hey, Calvin.
Wait, wait.

05:47.181 --> 05:49.049
I heard about you.

05:49.149 --> 05:50.784
-Chris.
-At the restaurant.

05:50.884 --> 05:54.154
Okay, you know what?
Do you need me to come help you?

05:54.254 --> 05:56.456
What are you gonna do?

05:56.557 --> 05:58.392
Do not let this bitch fool you.

05:58.492 --> 06:02.296
I played football
in my boy years.

06:02.396 --> 06:05.065
Look, thanks for the backup,
but I got this.

06:05.165 --> 06:06.767
You sure?

06:06.867 --> 06:08.502
What did I say?

06:08.602 --> 06:12.339
Yeah, yeah. You right.
I'm coming.

06:12.439 --> 06:13.907
I'm coming.

06:23.150 --> 06:26.019
You have to go.

06:26.119 --> 06:27.254
-What?
-Yeah.

06:27.354 --> 06:29.289
You don't want more?

06:29.389 --> 06:32.192
I have to talk to Danni.

06:32.292 --> 06:35.329
What is she even doing
here this late?

06:35.429 --> 06:37.497
I think something's going on
with Sabrina, so--

06:37.598 --> 06:41.235
-Oh, Sabrina.
-Don't fake like you care.

06:41.335 --> 06:42.503
Oh, Sabrina.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.872
So, you want me to leave?

06:44.972 --> 06:47.574
Please.

06:49.276 --> 06:50.477
Okay.

06:51.178 --> 06:52.779
Okay.

06:53.780 --> 06:57.918
Can we finish this
up maybe tonight?

07:00.087 --> 07:02.623
Or tomorrow?

07:02.723 --> 07:07.995
I think you gave
me a lot tonight

07:08.095 --> 07:11.832
and I think that'll
hold me over for a while.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.000
Yeah?

07:13.100 --> 07:16.970
-A long, long, long-
-[Danni] Yes, he did!

07:17.070 --> 07:19.306
-Danni!
-How could she?

07:19.406 --> 07:20.707
[Danni] What?

07:20.807 --> 07:25.646
Anyway, so--
You won't be--

07:25.746 --> 07:27.614
You won't be calling him over?

07:27.714 --> 07:30.017
Oh my gosh, can you keep his--

07:30.117 --> 07:32.352
Two seconds,
let's just have a conversation

07:32.452 --> 07:35.722
without thinking
about anyone else.

07:35.822 --> 07:38.992
-For two seconds.
-Okay, fine.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.928
Okay.

07:53.207 --> 07:55.509
-Girl, is he here?
-Would you stop?

07:55.609 --> 08:01.114
-I mean, I'm just--
-Que! Que!

08:01.215 --> 08:03.350
-He's not answering.
-Chris!

08:03.450 --> 08:05.452
Okay.

08:05.552 --> 08:07.955
I told you!
I got this!

08:08.055 --> 08:09.156
All right?

08:09.256 --> 08:14.461
I've got your back, man.
Just in case you need me.

08:14.561 --> 08:17.497
In those slippery-ass shoes?

08:17.598 --> 08:19.900
These help me glide.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.936
Now I know why you
and Maurice are friends.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.638
Que!

08:27.241 --> 08:28.876
Que!

08:28.976 --> 08:31.044
-[Que] What?
-Bring your ass out here!

08:31.144 --> 08:32.479
I'm busy.

08:32.578 --> 08:34.481
You heard what I said.
Get your ass out here now!

08:34.581 --> 08:36.183
[Que] No shit.
I said I was busy.

08:36.283 --> 08:40.721
-What is he doing?
-All right.

08:40.821 --> 08:41.989
Well, what are you guys doing?

08:42.088 --> 08:43.357
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

08:43.457 --> 08:44.691
Not in my girlfriend's bed.

08:44.790 --> 08:47.761
What, man?
Shit, close the door!

08:47.861 --> 08:50.664
What are you
closing the door for?

08:50.764 --> 08:53.033
Look, get up.
Come out here.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.468
You and I need to talk.

08:54.568 --> 08:56.036
You're embarrassing
me like this?

08:56.136 --> 08:57.704
Get up!
You heard me!

08:57.804 --> 08:59.573
Hold on, man. Who the hell do
you think you are?

08:59.673 --> 09:02.442
I'm not playing with you.
Get your ass up now.

09:02.543 --> 09:05.279
Don't make me drag your ass
out of this bed.

09:05.379 --> 09:07.080
You see this shit here?

09:07.181 --> 09:08.415
This -- trippin'.

09:08.515 --> 09:12.052
Don't use that word.
I've already told you.

09:12.152 --> 09:16.056
Get the -- up now!

09:16.557 --> 09:18.492
Hey! Hey!

09:18.592 --> 09:22.763
Get up, cover up
and come out!

09:37.511 --> 09:39.813
I'll go get your shoes.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:41.748 --> 09:45.419
-Danni.
-There you go.

09:45.519 --> 09:49.022
Walk, brother.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.691
-See you later.
-See you later.

09:50.790 --> 09:53.493
-Bye.
-Bye.

09:53.727 --> 09:56.864
Enjoy my drink that I bought.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.239
Bye.

10:11.478 --> 10:13.447
Yes.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.817
You really don't care
about your friends.

10:16.917 --> 10:19.753
Of course,
I care about my friends.

10:19.853 --> 10:22.890
Have you called Karen?

10:22.990 --> 10:25.926
No, but I was planning
on calling her tomorrow.

10:26.026 --> 10:29.463
Mm-hmm.
Have you talked to Sabrina?

10:29.563 --> 10:32.733
No, I have not.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.936
Listen, they're grown women.
I'm sure they're fine.

10:36.036 --> 10:40.140
Yeah? Well, I think
she's fine in jail.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.209
Danni, I don't think so.

10:42.309 --> 10:43.777
Why?

10:43.877 --> 10:45.812
Because I called
some of my contacts

10:45.913 --> 10:47.648
and no one said anything.

10:47.748 --> 10:52.686
-What kind of contacts.
-The people who would know.

10:52.786 --> 10:56.890
You've been -- for
I'd say at least an hour

10:56.990 --> 11:00.160
from what I can smell here.

11:00.260 --> 11:03.564
Uh, check your phone.

11:03.864 --> 11:07.501
Where is my phone?
Easy, girl.

11:07.968 --> 11:09.903
Things have moved around.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.372
Yeah, maybe it was your
ovaries moving around.

11:12.472 --> 11:14.808
Go check your damn bedroom.

11:19.680 --> 11:23.951
Oh my God! Oh my God!
I have three missed calls.

11:24.251 --> 11:26.854
See? See?
From who?

11:26.954 --> 11:29.122
-From my contact.
-Call them.

11:29.223 --> 11:31.625
-Okay, I'm dialing right now.
-Call them now.

11:31.725 --> 11:33.927
Would you calm down?

11:34.795 --> 11:37.097
Oh, I was out with that guy
and he told me.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.099
He told me he thought
she was in on it

11:39.199 --> 11:40.834
and I saw them agents
get off the plane.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.169
I knew it.
I knew it.

11:42.269 --> 11:44.671
You saw what?

11:45.906 --> 11:48.509
Hi, Jackie, this is Andi.

11:48.609 --> 11:49.843
I am so sorry
I missed your call.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.612
And I'm so sorry it's so late.

11:51.712 --> 11:53.614
If you could call
me back right now,

11:53.714 --> 11:56.149
that would be greatly
appreciated. Thank you.

11:57.918 --> 12:00.087
-Oh, no.
-Dammit, Andi.

12:00.187 --> 12:01.555
Um, it's fine.

12:01.655 --> 12:05.626
I can reach out
to some other resources.

12:05.726 --> 12:07.094
Uh, give me a second.

12:07.194 --> 12:09.630
I'm gonna find out
where she is, okay?

12:09.730 --> 12:10.898
You know Sabrina
can't handle no jail.

12:10.998 --> 12:14.334
I know that.
Just give me a minute.

12:20.974 --> 12:23.277
He is in my sister's bed.

12:23.377 --> 12:24.811
-I know.
-With a woman.

12:24.912 --> 12:25.879
I know.

12:25.979 --> 12:27.447
Maurice is gonna die.

12:27.548 --> 12:30.117
He's gonna die.
He's gonna die.

12:30.217 --> 12:32.019
He's lost his mind.

12:34.188 --> 12:35.856
-What is it?
-All right, look.

12:35.956 --> 12:37.524
Whoa, hold on, hold on.

12:37.624 --> 12:38.592
The first thing you're
going to do

12:38.692 --> 12:40.127
is take that tone
out of your voice.

12:40.227 --> 12:41.628
--, who the hell you
think you're talking to?

12:41.728 --> 12:44.798
Okay. Maybe you don't
have to use that word.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.767
Nah, forget all that.

12:46.867 --> 12:51.738
-Look, did you set Maurice up?
-What?

12:51.839 --> 12:53.674
You heard me. Don't act
like you didn't hear me.

12:53.774 --> 12:56.543
-Did you set him up?
-No, why would I do that?

12:56.643 --> 13:00.914
-Que, I'm telling you.
-Why would I send him to jail?

13:01.014 --> 13:04.751
Oh, he is not smart.

13:04.852 --> 13:08.722
Whoever said anything about
Maurice being in jail?

13:08.822 --> 13:11.758
Is he?

13:11.859 --> 13:15.329
All right. I'm gonna need you to
pack up what little shit you got

13:15.429 --> 13:17.965
-and get the -- out!
-I'm not going nowhere.

13:18.065 --> 13:19.933
You think I'm playing with you?

13:20.033 --> 13:23.237
-What you gonna do, Calvin?
-Don't make me kick your ass.

13:23.337 --> 13:24.505
I'm gonna kick your ass.

13:24.605 --> 13:25.806
No, no, please don't
touch his nipples.

13:25.906 --> 13:27.074
Those are off limits.

13:27.174 --> 13:29.009
You heard me.

13:29.109 --> 13:33.814
What you gonna do, Calvin,
with that bitch-ass blouse on?

13:33.914 --> 13:36.316
You know what?

13:38.218 --> 13:39.686
Stop, stop!
Don't hurt him!

13:39.786 --> 13:42.422
Come on!
Come on Calvin, what you got?

13:42.523 --> 13:45.025
Eye jab!
Nice!

13:46.493 --> 13:49.329
Oh!
Get him Calvin!

13:49.429 --> 13:52.232
Calvin, elbow! Yes!

13:52.332 --> 13:55.569
Get him Calvin!
Yes!

13:59.606 --> 14:03.410
So much testosterone!

14:03.510 --> 14:07.080
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

14:08.081 --> 14:09.149
Get your ass off me!

14:09.249 --> 14:11.185
You like it.

14:11.285 --> 14:13.387
No more fighting.

14:14.821 --> 14:16.490
You guys take my breath away

14:16.590 --> 14:18.959
What the -- is wrong with you?

14:19.059 --> 14:21.528
If I find out you had
anything to do with Maurice

14:21.628 --> 14:23.830
being put in jail,
I'm -- you up!

14:23.931 --> 14:25.699
Okay.

14:25.799 --> 14:28.302
And I ain't going nowhere
'cause I got me a warm bed

14:28.402 --> 14:31.271
and a warm bitch
and we ain't leaving.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.739
-Is that right?
- -- right.

14:32.840 --> 14:35.375
Que, you should go.
You should go.

14:37.344 --> 14:39.079
Ow.

14:40.480 --> 14:44.618
Hey, what do we do?
I mean, do we call the police?

14:44.718 --> 14:46.553
What?

14:46.653 --> 14:49.289
See, that's that
white shit y'all do.

14:49.389 --> 14:52.726
Don't you have two white dads?

14:54.027 --> 14:56.663
I'ma handle this shit.

14:56.763 --> 15:00.067
Well, what are you going to do
Calvin 'cause that was a lot.

15:07.307 --> 15:09.510
I need a shower.

15:14.014 --> 15:17.251
Hi, yes. Uh-huh.

15:17.351 --> 15:21.021
Yes, thank you.
No, it's Sabrina Hollis.

15:21.121 --> 15:24.558
No, give me a second.
Let me write this down.

15:26.293 --> 15:30.430
No, it's--
It's federal?

15:30.531 --> 15:32.733
Wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

15:32.833 --> 15:35.502
And who is that?
Okay.

15:38.138 --> 15:39.473
Okay.
Thank you.

15:39.573 --> 15:43.443
Thank you so much for this
information. Thank you.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.150
What's going on?

15:50.250 --> 15:51.852
She got arrested.

15:51.952 --> 15:56.456
-You've gotta be kidding me.
-No, I am not.

16:01.228 --> 16:02.329
Let's go get her out.

16:02.429 --> 16:04.731
No, no,
it's not that simple, Danni.

16:04.831 --> 16:06.767
That's not how that works.
What are you saying to me?

16:06.867 --> 16:08.836
I'm saying this is
a federal crime,

16:08.936 --> 16:13.507
so she hasn't even
seen the judge yet.

16:13.607 --> 16:14.842
Damn, I don't--

16:14.942 --> 16:16.210
What does that mean?
I don't know.

16:16.310 --> 16:17.544
Okay, okay.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.479
So there's nothing we can
do about it tonight.

16:19.580 --> 16:21.915
We just have to figure out
in the morning.

16:22.015 --> 16:25.052
So we're supposed
to just leave her there?

16:25.152 --> 16:28.422
Danni, we can't do anything
about it tonight.

16:28.522 --> 16:29.690
Then what the
hell are you, Andi?

16:29.790 --> 16:32.426
I am a divorce attorney
and this is criminal.

16:32.526 --> 16:34.728
Matter of fact,
it's federal.

16:34.828 --> 16:36.997
I don't know what
to do either, okay?

16:37.097 --> 16:39.132
This is bullshit.

16:39.233 --> 16:42.669
Just, you know what?
Um--

16:43.570 --> 16:46.306
Just go home,
get some rest.

16:46.406 --> 16:48.575
I'll figure it out.

16:49.176 --> 16:50.611
No, uh-uh, no.

16:50.711 --> 16:53.480
You know what?
I'ma call his ass.

16:53.580 --> 16:55.349
Call, call who?
You have a contact?

16:55.449 --> 16:57.017
-Oh, the cop who told me.
-No, no, no.

16:57.117 --> 16:59.453
Don't do that.
No, no, no, no. Uh-uh.

16:59.553 --> 17:01.054
-You cannot talk to him.
-Why not?

17:01.154 --> 17:02.789
-You can't talk to him again.
-Why?

17:02.890 --> 17:05.157
Because we don't know
what he has on Sabrina

17:05.259 --> 17:07.828
and it could incriminate
her even more, okay?

17:07.928 --> 17:12.065
So no, don't even
think about it.

17:12.633 --> 17:14.902
-This is very serious.
-Shit, shit, shit.

17:15.002 --> 17:17.738
This is some
high-level shit, Danni.

17:18.672 --> 17:21.108
Look, I'm a lawyer.
I know how this goes, okay?

17:21.208 --> 17:25.712
It can be long.
And it can be tough.

17:25.811 --> 17:29.616
All we can do is show her
that we love her

17:29.716 --> 17:33.921
and you're gonna have to relax

17:34.021 --> 17:35.956
and go to work like normal.

17:36.056 --> 17:39.293
Go home
and get some sleep.

17:42.162 --> 17:46.533
Well, I'm not gonna
be able to rest, so...

17:46.633 --> 17:49.203
I know.

17:50.070 --> 17:52.005
No, I think you're gonna sleep

17:52.105 --> 17:54.975
like you've just been -- down
and you missed phone calls.

17:55.075 --> 17:57.444
Are we really talking about who
I'm sleeping with right now

17:57.544 --> 17:58.846
in this very moment?

17:58.946 --> 18:02.115
-Yeah, I guess you're right.
-Yeah.

18:06.854 --> 18:08.589
Sabrina don't know
nothing about jail.

18:08.689 --> 18:10.257
-I know. I know.
-She's not the one.

18:10.357 --> 18:12.993
She is not the one.

18:13.093 --> 18:16.363
Now you could probably handle
yourself, but Sabrina, no.

18:16.463 --> 18:18.999
Absolutely not.

18:20.234 --> 18:23.470
You've almost been to jail
several times, actually.

18:23.904 --> 18:26.173
All right, Danni.
You can go home and um--

18:26.273 --> 18:27.107
I'll keep you updated.

18:27.207 --> 18:28.709
I'll let you know
what's going on.

18:28.809 --> 18:32.579
-Unless you want to stay here.
-No. Semen-covered walls.

18:32.679 --> 18:36.083
You can sleep
in my room with me.

18:36.183 --> 18:37.584
Y'all done --
all over this place.

18:37.684 --> 18:38.886
Absolutely not.

18:38.986 --> 18:41.989
I mean, there're
a few corners that--

18:42.089 --> 18:43.490
I'm great.

18:43.590 --> 18:48.829
We can Christian, but okay and
Danni listen, I'm worried, too.

18:48.929 --> 18:51.865
I'm gonna figure this out, okay?

19:01.508 --> 19:04.511
-What's up?
-Hey.

19:05.579 --> 19:08.615
I know you ain't trying
to sneak out of here.

19:08.715 --> 19:11.318
No.

19:11.418 --> 19:13.987
Really? What's going on?

19:14.087 --> 19:15.789
-Nothing.
-So where you going?

19:15.889 --> 19:17.991
I'm going to the gym,
then I'm going to work.

19:18.091 --> 19:19.927
Perfect. I'm going with you.

19:20.027 --> 19:21.495
Okay, I'm already ready,
so I'll see you there.

19:21.595 --> 19:24.331
Aight, stop, stop, stop.
See, see?

19:24.431 --> 19:26.333
What's going on?

19:26.433 --> 19:28.202
Zac, nothing.

19:28.302 --> 19:30.404
I'm just trying to go work out.
That's all.

19:30.504 --> 19:33.740
So you don't wanna talk
about last night?

19:33.841 --> 19:37.611
No. No, I don't.

19:39.213 --> 19:41.315
-Zac.
-Yes.

19:41.415 --> 19:42.816
Do you know what
I do in the morning?

19:42.916 --> 19:44.918
-Yes.
-Okay. Tell me.

19:45.018 --> 19:46.119
What do I do?

19:46.220 --> 19:49.823
You get out of the bed.
You shower.

19:49.923 --> 19:51.558
-You pray.
-Yes.

19:51.658 --> 19:52.593
Yes.

19:52.693 --> 19:56.430
-I set my meditations
for the day.

19:56.530 --> 20:00.734
And my intention for today
is to have a good day.

20:00.834 --> 20:03.570
Come on, 'Tima, don't do that.
Don't do that.

20:03.670 --> 20:06.540
I'm sorry, Zac. I don't wanna
start my day off with your ex.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.543
So are we ever gonna
talk about it?

20:09.643 --> 20:13.947
Zac, honey. I just
finished talking to Jesus

20:14.047 --> 20:16.016
and I don't wanna call
Him back so soon, okay?

20:16.116 --> 20:18.952
I'm not really trying to waste
my unlimited minutes on her.

20:19.052 --> 20:20.387
That's fair.
That's fair.

20:20.487 --> 20:23.323
But I did go over there,
so I don't wanna hear nothing

20:23.423 --> 20:25.726
about this again 'cause I
went over there last night.

20:25.826 --> 20:28.929
You told me to check.
I went over there. Okay?

20:29.029 --> 20:31.098
And yet he is making me talk
about it. I just said--

20:31.198 --> 20:32.399
Hey, hold on.
Hold on.

20:32.499 --> 20:34.334
Let me ask you a question.
Time out. Stop.

20:34.434 --> 20:36.103
How come every time you want
to talk about Karen,

20:36.203 --> 20:39.740
I've gotta stop every thing
I'm doing to talk about Karen?

20:39.840 --> 20:41.175
But when I want
to talk about Karen,

20:41.275 --> 20:42.242
I gotta wait til you're ready.

20:42.342 --> 20:44.044
I'm going through
this shit, too.

20:44.144 --> 20:48.248
Operative word, you.
I don't know her

20:48.348 --> 20:50.350
and I'm trying
to stay off her ass.

20:50.450 --> 20:54.021
-Fatima, come on.
-No, Zac.

20:54.121 --> 20:57.724
-Really?
-Yes.

20:57.824 --> 21:00.694
Look, you know what?
I need to tell you something.

21:00.794 --> 21:01.828
Oh, God.
Now you wanna talk.

21:01.929 --> 21:03.197
At first you
didn't want to talk.

21:03.297 --> 21:04.464
Now you wanna tell me something.

21:04.565 --> 21:05.632
-Zac, no. Seriously.
-Go ahead. Go ahead.

21:05.732 --> 21:07.267
Look, I was raised
by my grandmother.

21:07.367 --> 21:08.702
I know that.

21:08.802 --> 21:11.471
Yeah, but what you don't
know is I have a cousin

21:11.572 --> 21:14.508
who is a ruthless bitch.

21:14.608 --> 21:17.144
And she wanted me to go down
that same path as her.

21:17.244 --> 21:18.412
But I decided not
to go down the same

21:18.512 --> 21:22.182
path as my family, all right?

21:22.282 --> 21:26.587
Look, I don't want drama, I
don't wanna whoop nobody's ass.

21:26.687 --> 21:30.724
I will.
And I know people that will.

21:30.824 --> 21:33.627
Baby, I just want peace.
That's it.

21:33.727 --> 21:36.597
So wait, so it's
all coming together.

21:36.697 --> 21:40.300
That's how you know the guys
that beat up Hayden.

21:40.400 --> 21:44.004
Yes. I called her and she
handled it for me.

21:44.104 --> 21:48.408
But babe, that is not all
she wanted to do to him.

21:48.509 --> 21:50.711
Well, what'd she want
to do to him?

21:50.811 --> 21:52.713
Let's just say I spared his ass.

21:52.813 --> 21:55.649
Wait a minute.
Why would you spare Hayden?

21:55.749 --> 21:58.852
No, don't even answer that.
Who is this woman?

22:00.487 --> 22:03.957
You know what?
I'm gonna let you meet her.

22:04.057 --> 22:06.226
That's what I'm talking about
'cause I got a family now.

22:06.326 --> 22:08.228
I got some people I want
to get -- up.

22:08.328 --> 22:11.431
-Okay.
-I do, though.

22:11.532 --> 22:12.866
All right. I gotta go.

22:12.966 --> 22:14.935
Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait,
but I get it now, though.

22:15.035 --> 22:17.171
-What?
-That's why you are like so cool

22:17.271 --> 22:18.605
with me being
in and out of prison

22:18.705 --> 22:20.274
and the whole stock thing

22:20.374 --> 22:22.242
'cause your family
messed up, too.

22:22.342 --> 22:25.612
-I get it.
-Partly. Yeah.

22:25.712 --> 22:27.814
'Cause baby, the shit my
family has done

22:27.915 --> 22:30.684
will make that little shit you
do look like child's play.

22:30.784 --> 22:33.520
Look like child's play.

22:33.620 --> 22:35.022
-That's your last time.
-You think you're so gangsta'.

22:35.122 --> 22:37.691
You not a thug, Fatima.
You not a thug.

22:37.791 --> 22:39.226
I showed you that one time.

22:39.326 --> 22:40.661
Mm-hmm.

22:40.761 --> 22:42.863
Yes. Okay. Well, look,
I'ma give you your space.

22:42.963 --> 22:45.065
I'ma let you go
to the gym, okay?

22:45.165 --> 22:47.467
Because I am not trying
to ruin your mood.

22:47.568 --> 22:49.269
You won't,
but your ex might.

22:49.369 --> 22:50.804
-Okay.
-All right.

22:50.904 --> 22:52.873
But for the record, though,
I could take you to the gym.

22:52.973 --> 22:54.975
Zachary.

22:55.075 --> 22:57.878
What? So I can't talk to you and
I can't take you to the gym?

22:57.978 --> 23:00.547
Okay, you know what?
Fine. Let's go.

23:00.647 --> 23:02.816
All right, I'm ready to go.
I've got to get dressed.

23:02.916 --> 23:05.853
-Uh, just get dressed?
-Yeah.

23:05.953 --> 23:08.088
No, you need to go throw
some water on that face

23:08.188 --> 23:10.858
and hit that toothpaste.

23:10.958 --> 23:15.395
-It's that bad?
-Baby, it's curling my hairs up.

23:15.495 --> 23:17.297
I see it.
I see it.

23:17.397 --> 23:18.999
Since we're being honest,

23:19.099 --> 23:21.735
sometimes when I wake up
your breath be like-

23:21.835 --> 23:23.437
-And you be all in my face.
-It be barking.

23:23.537 --> 23:25.405
-You be all in-
-Ruff, ruff, ruff.

23:25.506 --> 23:27.941
-That be you.
-Go.

23:28.041 --> 23:29.409
I like dogs, though.

23:29.510 --> 23:30.677
You know what?
I'ma go ahead and go.

23:30.777 --> 23:32.112
I'll see you at the gym.

23:32.212 --> 23:33.847
-Like my doggy style, huh?
-I'll see you at the gym.

23:33.947 --> 23:36.283
-Ruff, ruff, ruff.
-Shut-up.

23:36.383 --> 23:38.085
Ruff, ruff, ruff.

23:41.054 --> 23:46.226
[phone ringing]

23:46.326 --> 23:48.729
-Hello?
-[Calvin] Hey.

23:48.829 --> 23:51.431
-Who is this?
-It's me, Calvin.

23:51.532 --> 23:53.667
Oh, hey.
Have you talked to Maurice?

23:53.767 --> 23:56.270
No.
He's in jail.

23:56.370 --> 23:57.771
In jail?

23:57.871 --> 24:01.542
Yeah. That punk-ass --
who he let stay here set him up.

24:01.642 --> 24:03.844
-What?
-[Calvin] Yeah.

24:03.944 --> 24:05.412
What are we gonna do, Danni?

24:05.512 --> 24:07.181
I don't know,
but I have Andi on it.

24:07.281 --> 24:08.849
She's the lawyer.

24:08.949 --> 24:11.218
All right, look, I've got about
$20,000 in my savings account.

24:11.318 --> 24:12.920
We can use that to get her out.

24:13.020 --> 24:15.055
-Oh, you do?
-[Calvin] Yeah.

24:15.155 --> 24:17.357
Oh, okay.
All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:17.457 --> 24:19.359
Let me get that.
That'll work.

24:19.459 --> 24:21.328
You can bring it in cash.

24:21.428 --> 24:22.663
Sure.

24:22.763 --> 24:25.632
All right. Perfect.
Yeah. Okay. Bring that.

24:25.732 --> 24:27.634
That's good.
That's real good.

24:27.734 --> 24:29.803
All right.
Where do you want to meet?

24:29.903 --> 24:33.674
Calvin, I was gonna
keep your money, man.

24:33.774 --> 24:36.343
-You know that, right?
-Danni, this isn't the time.

24:36.443 --> 24:37.811
You're right.
Okay. I'm sorry.

24:37.911 --> 24:40.013
I'm on my way to Andi's now.
[line beeps]

24:40.113 --> 24:42.182
Hello? Hello?

24:42.282 --> 24:45.085
Oh, my phone's ringing.

24:45.185 --> 24:46.920
All right, look.
Take care of your business

24:47.020 --> 24:48.622
and just call me if you hear
anything, all right?

24:48.722 --> 24:50.557
-[Danni] Okay.
-All right.

24:57.297 --> 24:59.867
-Hello.
-Hey.

24:59.967 --> 25:01.368
Hi.

25:01.468 --> 25:03.670
Look, I was just calling to see
if you'd meet me for dinner.

25:03.770 --> 25:05.906
I thought you left town.

25:06.006 --> 25:09.643
I did, but I'll fly back in
if you'll meet with me.

25:09.743 --> 25:11.712
What's this about, Preston.

25:11.812 --> 25:13.714
Danni, I just want
to talk to you.

25:13.814 --> 25:17.284
Didn't you say you were
gonna marry that girl?

25:17.384 --> 25:19.720
Yeah, and you didn't answer me.

25:19.820 --> 25:21.288
Okay, Preston.

25:21.388 --> 25:25.692
I don't have time for this shit.
You and I already talked, so--

25:25.792 --> 25:27.995
So you're really over me?

25:28.095 --> 25:31.164
-Preston.
-Look, it's fine if you are.

25:31.265 --> 25:32.733
I just wanna talk to you.

25:32.833 --> 25:36.170
Listen, I'm in the middle
of something and I can't,

25:36.270 --> 25:38.572
I can't do this right now.

25:38.672 --> 25:42.476
-You got company?
-No, I don't.

25:42.576 --> 25:44.578
But I have a problem
I'm dealing with.

25:44.678 --> 25:46.513
Is it something
I can help you with?

25:46.613 --> 25:49.850
No. You can't.

25:49.950 --> 25:51.919
All right, well, look.
I'll be in town.

25:52.019 --> 25:53.687
If you can meet with me,
then great.

25:53.787 --> 25:56.456
Well, all right.
I'll let you know, okay?

25:56.557 --> 25:59.927
-Okay.
-Do you know what time?

26:14.007 --> 26:17.344
-Good morning.
-Hey.

26:17.444 --> 26:21.448
-I made you some breakfast.
-Thank you.

26:21.548 --> 26:25.986
Baby, you have got
to get a new sofa.

26:26.086 --> 26:28.322
Oh, I'm sorry, mama.

26:28.422 --> 26:29.790
I mean, I have gone camping

26:29.890 --> 26:33.160
and I have slept on rocks
softer than that sofa.

26:33.260 --> 26:36.330
Okay. All right.

26:36.430 --> 26:40.934
Shoot, I almost climbed
into bed with you.

26:41.034 --> 26:43.003
I wish you would've.

26:43.103 --> 26:47.574
You were sleeping and I didn't
want to wake you up.

26:47.674 --> 26:50.477
Well, thank you for all this.

26:50.577 --> 26:54.548
It's okay.
How are you feeling?

26:54.648 --> 26:56.016
I'm okay.

26:56.116 --> 26:59.052
-Good?
-Yeah, I am.

26:59.152 --> 27:03.156
Not feeling too stressed out?

27:03.257 --> 27:04.324
No.

27:04.424 --> 27:06.793
Okay, well,
I made you some tea

27:06.894 --> 27:09.463
and that should keep
you kind of mellow.

27:09.563 --> 27:10.597
I need a drink, but-

27:10.697 --> 27:14.902
Yeah, well,
that's not gonna happen.

27:15.002 --> 27:17.204
I know.

27:17.304 --> 27:21.575
I think you and I need to talk.

27:21.675 --> 27:23.210
Okay.

27:23.310 --> 27:24.645
About the accountant.

27:24.745 --> 27:27.948
He's not an accountant,
mama, okay?

27:28.048 --> 27:30.417
And about Zac.

27:33.620 --> 27:36.323
I had a dream last night
that he came by.

27:36.423 --> 27:38.825
Oh, he did come by.

27:38.926 --> 27:40.527
-Did he?
-Mm-hmm.

27:40.627 --> 27:44.898
But I wouldn't let him see you.

27:44.998 --> 27:47.501
Thank you.

27:47.601 --> 27:50.137
I don't believe you really think
that's a good idea.

27:50.237 --> 27:55.542
Mama, um, I just
wanna let him go.

27:55.642 --> 28:00.414
That's all.
I just want to be over him.

28:00.514 --> 28:03.884
For him to do right by this baby

28:03.984 --> 28:06.553
and move on.

28:06.653 --> 28:11.024
You sure the baby's his?

28:11.124 --> 28:13.594
Honestly,

28:14.862 --> 28:17.931
sometimes I don't know anymore.

28:18.832 --> 28:22.469
You just have to take it
one day at a time, baby.

28:23.337 --> 28:25.239
Right.

28:25.339 --> 28:29.977
Okay, what about the
accountant preacher?

28:30.077 --> 28:32.880
Oh, that's right.

28:32.980 --> 28:34.715
Explain something to me.

28:34.815 --> 28:36.950
He doesn't drink,
but he can have sex?

28:37.050 --> 28:40.254
Doesn't the Bible say
something about that.

28:40.354 --> 28:44.424
Yes, mama, it does.

28:44.525 --> 28:48.762
So what if it's his?

28:48.862 --> 28:51.932
Well.

28:52.032 --> 28:55.836
Seriously, what if it is?

28:57.271 --> 29:00.340
He's an amazing man.

29:00.440 --> 29:04.244
He's sweet
and loving,

29:04.344 --> 29:05.679
but...

29:05.779 --> 29:10.617
But you don't love him
like you love Zac.

29:10.717 --> 29:15.722
I really do care about him.
I do, but Zac...

29:17.457 --> 29:20.194
Zac has edge.

29:20.294 --> 29:22.796
-Mama.
-Well.

29:22.896 --> 29:25.265
Like daughter
like mother, honey.

29:25.365 --> 29:27.234
You like edge.
I like edge.

29:27.334 --> 29:30.737
Lord knows,
I like edge.

29:30.838 --> 29:33.073
Why do we want the bad boys?

29:33.173 --> 29:34.575
Bad boys?

29:34.675 --> 29:38.645
Oh my God, Zac is many things,
but he is not a bad boy.

29:38.745 --> 29:42.216
Mama, he was in jail
and he cheats.

29:42.316 --> 29:45.319
Well, yeah,

29:45.419 --> 29:48.121
but he's not a bad boy like the
bad boys I hang out with.

29:48.222 --> 29:52.392
Oh, you're talking about you
and your biker gang.

29:52.492 --> 29:54.695
Now those are some bad boys.

29:54.795 --> 29:57.698
And oh God,
the younger, the better.

29:57.798 --> 30:02.936
Oh, mama. Come on.
Mama, bring it back.

30:03.036 --> 30:05.005
Please.

30:05.105 --> 30:08.575
Well, shit. You know we talk
about everything, right?

30:08.675 --> 30:10.711
We do.
Okay.

30:10.811 --> 30:15.115
So can I offer some advice?

30:15.215 --> 30:18.252
Please.

30:18.352 --> 30:22.489
Do you think you could
be calm enough

30:22.589 --> 30:26.093
to have both Aaron and Zac here
at the same time

30:26.193 --> 30:27.427
for you to talk to them?

30:27.528 --> 30:28.862
What?

30:28.962 --> 30:33.433
No, I know.
I know, but hear me out.

30:33.534 --> 30:34.935
This is what I think
you need to do.

30:35.035 --> 30:37.971
I think you need to write down
on paper a letter

30:38.071 --> 30:43.243
to each of them telling them
exactly how you feel

30:43.343 --> 30:45.012
and what's going on with you.

30:45.112 --> 30:48.115
And then we'll bring them in,
read it to them,

30:48.215 --> 30:49.550
and then finally,
hopefully,

30:49.650 --> 30:52.085
you'll get on
the right path, baby.

30:52.186 --> 30:53.720
Well, I have told them, mama.

30:53.820 --> 30:58.325
-No, baby, you really haven't.
-Yes, I have.

30:58.425 --> 31:00.694
Have you written it down
and read it to them?

31:00.794 --> 31:02.930
No, okay.
Well, no.

31:03.030 --> 31:04.765
I haven't written it down,
but who writes--

31:04.865 --> 31:07.568
Okay, let me explain the
importance of writing it down

31:07.668 --> 31:10.204
and reading it to them.

31:10.304 --> 31:12.472
When you're passionate
and you need to get something

31:12.573 --> 31:16.143
off your chest,
have you ever just gone ahead

31:16.243 --> 31:18.145
and said everything that you
think you needed to say.

31:18.245 --> 31:19.713
And then the second that person
walks away,

31:19.813 --> 31:22.583
you go, shit,
why didn't I say that?

31:22.683 --> 31:27.254
Or oh man,
I totally forgot to say that.

31:27.354 --> 31:30.357
If you write it down,
if it's there in front of you,

31:30.457 --> 31:31.625
you'll be able to read it.

31:31.725 --> 31:33.927
You'll be able
to be concise about it.

31:34.027 --> 31:36.730
You'll be able
to get it all off your chest.

31:36.830 --> 31:40.934
And truly you'll be able to
get back onto the right path.

31:43.637 --> 31:47.307
Okay.
If you say so.

31:47.407 --> 31:50.210
Trust me on this.
Okay?

31:50.310 --> 31:51.512
Okay.

31:51.612 --> 31:54.882
Because you really do
need to get clear.

31:55.415 --> 31:56.517
I said okay, mama.

31:56.617 --> 31:57.751
I'm gonna write
the letters, okay?

31:57.851 --> 31:59.820
Can I eat the breakfast
that you made?

31:59.920 --> 32:02.322
You can go ahead and do that.

32:02.422 --> 32:08.262
Look, I know this is gonna
be hard, but you trust me?

32:09.563 --> 32:10.731
Yeah.

32:10.831 --> 32:13.734
Okay, I think it's the
best thing to do.

32:13.834 --> 32:16.937
You really do need
to get stress free.

32:17.037 --> 32:19.907
Okay, mama.
Can I eat now?

32:20.007 --> 32:21.708
Sure.

32:22.809 --> 32:25.612
Yes, I know,
but what about the charges?

32:25.712 --> 32:27.748
That's the information I need.

32:27.848 --> 32:30.417
Uh-huh.
[elevator dings]

32:30.517 --> 32:32.753
It's that serious?

32:32.853 --> 32:35.622
Okay. No, thank you. Thank you.
You've done a lot.

32:35.722 --> 32:38.025
No, I'm heading
into the office right now.

32:38.125 --> 32:40.093
Thank you.

32:40.627 --> 32:43.297
Hey. So?

32:45.933 --> 32:49.837
Okay.
Danni, I need you not to panic.

32:51.171 --> 32:52.339
Andi, you're killing me.

32:52.439 --> 32:56.009
Okay.
Um, they charged her,

32:56.109 --> 32:58.478
but she still hasn't been
in to see the judge.

32:58.579 --> 33:01.114
So I can't go in to see her.

33:01.215 --> 33:02.983
No one can go in to
see her right now.

33:03.083 --> 33:05.552
-How is that even legal?
-I don't know.

33:05.652 --> 33:09.423
I have one more person
I could possibly call.

33:09.523 --> 33:12.693
-Okay. Who?
-Robin, my boss.

33:12.793 --> 33:16.630
But he's in London in court,
so I have to wait.

33:16.730 --> 33:17.898
Okay, so--

33:17.998 --> 33:22.102
I'm gonna call him, okay?
Of course.

33:22.202 --> 33:25.005
This is crazy, girl.

33:25.105 --> 33:28.442
Like Sabrina is
not made for jail.

33:28.542 --> 33:30.744
-At all.
-I'm sick to my stomach.

33:30.844 --> 33:32.779
Thinking about her,
I could barely smoke.

33:32.880 --> 33:35.048
Okay, I need some answers.

33:35.148 --> 33:38.685
How did this happen?
Tell me everything you know.

33:38.785 --> 33:42.089
Well, it's that -- boy
Maurice was messing with.

33:42.189 --> 33:43.290
Who?

33:43.390 --> 33:44.825
Yeah, Calvin called to tell me

33:44.925 --> 33:47.494
that he was living with them
and he thinks he flipped on him.

33:47.594 --> 33:51.431
-What?
-Yeah, that shit is crazy.

33:51.532 --> 33:53.300
I know.

33:53.400 --> 33:55.102
Okay, so what we gonna do, huh?

33:55.202 --> 33:56.837
Listen, I am doing
everything I can.

33:56.937 --> 34:00.807
I made 100 phone calls,
at least.

34:00.908 --> 34:03.443
We just have to let her know
we're here for her.

34:03.544 --> 34:06.280
That's it.
That's all we can do.

34:06.380 --> 34:09.516
This feels wrong.

34:09.616 --> 34:10.984
I know,
but she'll have to be okay.

34:11.083 --> 34:14.087
I mean,
she didn't commit this crime.

34:14.188 --> 34:17.591
But they got her
locked up anyway, Andi.

34:18.425 --> 34:22.829
I um, I didn't want to
tell you this part, but--

34:22.929 --> 34:24.697
What else, Andi?

34:24.797 --> 34:28.702
Apparently, they have
Maurice on tape

34:28.802 --> 34:32.472
confessing to the crime.

34:32.572 --> 34:34.308
Maurice was in on this?

34:34.408 --> 34:35.809
I don't know.

34:35.909 --> 34:39.346
That's all my contact
was able to tell me.

34:39.446 --> 34:41.547
It doesn't look good.

34:41.648 --> 34:43.449
This is bullshit.

34:43.550 --> 34:46.587
I will let you know
what I find out.

34:46.687 --> 34:50.257
I'll give you every update.
Just go to work.

34:50.357 --> 34:53.994
Don't call that cop.

34:54.094 --> 34:55.629
All right. Let's go.
What are we--

34:55.728 --> 34:57.865
Oh, yes.

35:07.341 --> 35:09.977
Hey, neighbors.

35:10.644 --> 35:12.379
Oh, you got your ears on?
Oh, okay.

35:12.479 --> 35:13.714
All right. Cool.

35:13.814 --> 35:16.650
Well, you look cute or whatever.
Hey, Zac.

35:16.750 --> 35:19.152
-What's up, Deja?
-What's up?

35:19.253 --> 35:22.422
-I see you getting it in.
-Yeah.

35:23.223 --> 35:25.526
You know, I've been trying
to keep my music down.

35:25.626 --> 35:29.396
That's good.
That's good.

35:30.564 --> 35:33.834
But you know what though,
um, my toilet,

35:33.934 --> 35:35.002
Oh my God.

35:35.102 --> 35:36.403
It's been leaking,
spraying all over the place.

35:36.503 --> 35:38.405
It's a hot mess in there.

35:38.505 --> 35:41.475
All right.
I'ma come check it out.

35:41.575 --> 35:43.844
Thank you.
You--

35:44.211 --> 35:47.047
You're such a good landlord.

35:48.715 --> 35:50.951
What's up there, Doritos,
I thought you couldn't hear me.

35:51.051 --> 35:52.186
I read lips, bitch.

35:52.286 --> 35:54.721
Oh, good for you.
That's cute.

35:54.821 --> 35:57.224
And why is shit always
breaking in your house?

35:57.324 --> 35:58.725
Ask the last person
who lived there.

35:58.825 --> 36:00.727
I don't know.

36:00.827 --> 36:02.896
-You let me find out.
-Hey, hey, hey.

36:02.996 --> 36:04.298
We working out.

36:04.398 --> 36:05.566
Let me find out
you breaking shit

36:05.666 --> 36:07.100
just so he can
come over there and fix it.

36:07.201 --> 36:08.969
Girl, that is so tacky.

36:09.069 --> 36:10.737
I would, I would never
do nothing like that.

36:10.838 --> 36:14.208
-Girl, please.
-Let me find out.

36:14.308 --> 36:15.876
And don't act like
it's beneath you.

36:15.976 --> 36:18.812
Hey, Deja, thank you
so much for coming over.

36:18.912 --> 36:21.014
We gotta finish our workout.
I'ma check on that, though.

36:21.114 --> 36:22.282
Okay. Thank you.

36:22.382 --> 36:23.517
Yeah, we both gonna
come check on that.

36:23.617 --> 36:24.952
Okay, I'll roll
the weed up then.

36:25.052 --> 36:27.020
Oh, you can't smoke 'cause
you got a corporate job.

36:27.120 --> 36:28.422
You work at the church.

36:28.522 --> 36:29.923
Oh, no you don't.

36:30.023 --> 36:31.358
Actually, it looks like
you just came from work.

36:31.458 --> 36:32.359
I did.

36:32.459 --> 36:34.094
-Wash your face.
-No.

36:34.194 --> 36:36.597
Nice, this is nice.
Everybody together like this.

36:36.697 --> 36:38.465
Together, working out.

36:38.565 --> 36:42.669
Well, it's a date then.
I'll fire the hookah up.

36:43.170 --> 36:45.739
Bye, neighbors.
You look cute or whatever.

36:45.839 --> 36:48.442
I see you getting it in.
Losing weight.

36:48.542 --> 36:50.811
That girl right there.

36:52.646 --> 36:54.281
The weight? You're gonna hit
her with the weight, though?

36:54.381 --> 36:56.517
-Why is she at this gym?
-I don't know.

36:56.617 --> 36:58.085
I didn't tell her
to get a membership here.

36:58.185 --> 37:00.687
I'm here with you.
That's it.

37:00.787 --> 37:02.856
You the one that
rented the side to her.

37:02.956 --> 37:05.659
You know how that happened.
Can we, can I just finish?

37:05.759 --> 37:08.095
Yeah, and I'm telling you,
it's not gonna end good, Zac.

37:08.195 --> 37:09.696
I know 'cause you got
thug in your blood.

37:09.796 --> 37:12.533
I get it.
I get it.

37:12.633 --> 37:13.834
You think I'm kidding?

37:13.934 --> 37:15.369
I don't, I don't, I don't.
Just calm down.

37:15.469 --> 37:16.837
Come on.
Just calm down.

37:16.937 --> 37:18.539
-What?
-Wait til you meet my cousin.

37:18.639 --> 37:20.107
What's your cousin gonna do?
So what?

37:20.207 --> 37:21.608
What's up?
'Cause I'll scrap.

37:21.708 --> 37:23.810
-Okay.
-I'll fight women.

37:23.911 --> 37:25.279
We'll see if you live
to see that one.

37:25.379 --> 37:27.581
I don't. I don't. Please.

37:30.450 --> 37:31.818
Look who's here.

37:31.919 --> 37:33.687
Hey, what's up, Zac?
Fatima.

37:33.787 --> 37:36.190
Hey, don't do that.
Don't do that.

37:36.290 --> 37:37.424
Don't do that.

37:37.524 --> 37:38.659
Look, I'm just glad
I ran into you.

37:38.759 --> 37:40.127
I actually was going
to talk to Gary about

37:40.227 --> 37:41.695
getting a number to call you.

37:41.795 --> 37:43.630
You don't need my number 'cause
we not talking on the phone.

37:43.730 --> 37:46.733
Zac, I just wanted to talk to
you about Karen real quick.

37:46.834 --> 37:48.902
Go on.

37:49.002 --> 37:50.771
-You were the one that--
-What's going on, Aaron?

37:50.871 --> 37:54.208
-Are you serious?
-Zac, it must be important.

37:54.308 --> 37:55.475
It is.

37:55.576 --> 37:57.044
All right, well, go on.

37:57.144 --> 38:01.048
Can we just talk in private?
If that's all right with you?

38:02.182 --> 38:04.685
Whatever you gotta say to me,
you can say to my girl.

38:04.785 --> 38:06.987
Even if it's about Karen?

38:07.087 --> 38:08.689
Go on, Aaron.

38:08.789 --> 38:10.691
Okay, so you know she's
in the hospital, right?

38:10.791 --> 38:12.860
[Both] We know that.

38:12.960 --> 38:14.828
All right, look, so she
had a health scare, okay?

38:14.928 --> 38:16.496
And the doctor wants her
to be on bed rest,

38:16.597 --> 38:17.798
so I just thought it'd be great

38:17.898 --> 38:19.900
if you and I did our best
to not stress her out.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.036
I'm not stressing her.
She's stressing herself.

38:23.136 --> 38:26.139
Coming to my house,
calling me, calling my girl.

38:26.240 --> 38:28.075
Okay, Zac, look, I'm not
coming for you, brother.

38:28.175 --> 38:29.943
-I just wanted us to try to-
-Try to do what?

38:30.043 --> 38:31.845
What?
I'm not doing nothing, okay?

38:31.945 --> 38:34.781
-Did she send you here?
-No, no, she didn't send me.

38:34.882 --> 38:37.317
-I just wanted to talk to you.
-You sure? You sure?

38:37.417 --> 38:38.585
Zac, we play ball together, man.

38:38.685 --> 38:40.387
No, we don't.
Stop saying that.

38:40.487 --> 38:42.189
We don't play
ball together, okay?

38:42.289 --> 38:44.992
We just so happen to play ball
at the same park,

38:45.092 --> 38:47.895
on the same court, at the same
time with the same ball,

38:47.995 --> 38:49.396
but we do not
play ball together.

38:49.496 --> 38:50.931
Zac, this isn't necessary, man.

38:51.031 --> 38:52.299
Okay, like what
if this baby is yours?

38:52.399 --> 38:53.700
What if the baby is mine?

38:53.800 --> 38:56.103
Then me and her are
gonna figure that out.

38:56.203 --> 38:59.506
All right.
All right. It was worth a shot.

38:59.606 --> 39:01.441
Don't, please don't say shot.

39:01.542 --> 39:03.877
'Cause people keep
getting shot around you.

39:03.977 --> 39:05.479
-I'm sorry.
-That ain't necessary.

39:05.579 --> 39:07.080
It's triggering for me.

39:07.181 --> 39:08.382
No pun intended.

39:08.482 --> 39:09.383
All right.
Thanks anyway.

39:09.483 --> 39:10.517
You're not welcome.

39:10.617 --> 39:11.552
I'll see you, Fatima.

39:11.652 --> 39:13.987
Don't do that.
Don't do that.

39:14.087 --> 39:16.190
Don't do that.

39:20.360 --> 39:22.196
Do you believe this guy?

39:23.497 --> 39:24.932
What?

39:25.632 --> 39:27.701
What?

39:28.235 --> 39:31.939
Zac, I'ma ask you
this shit one more time.

39:32.039 --> 39:33.674
What did I do?

39:33.774 --> 39:36.109
Are you still in love
with Karen?

39:36.210 --> 39:37.444
No. I'm not.

39:37.544 --> 39:40.314
You know I have love for Karen.
You know that, though.

39:40.414 --> 39:41.582
Well, do you want
to be with her?

39:41.682 --> 39:43.283
No, I don't, Fatima.
I've said this already.

39:43.383 --> 39:44.484
I don't wanna be with her.

39:44.585 --> 39:45.752
Okay, well, I'm just
trying to figure out

39:45.853 --> 39:48.922
-why you get so hostile?
-I don't know.

39:49.022 --> 39:52.860
Maybe because I don't meditate
and pray like you every morning.

39:52.960 --> 39:55.596
Look, Zac, when I see my exes,
they get nothing.

39:55.696 --> 39:58.432
No feelings,
no emotion, nothing.

39:58.532 --> 40:00.334
That's not the energy I remember

40:00.434 --> 40:03.971
you having at the park when we
ran into ole boy, though.

40:04.071 --> 40:07.040
That's besides the point,
but when I'm done, I'm done.

40:07.140 --> 40:08.308
Okay.

40:08.408 --> 40:09.743
Look, I was on
a yacht with my ex

40:09.843 --> 40:12.012
and he wanted to get back
with me, but I was over it.

40:12.112 --> 40:16.216
Okay. Let me say this one last
time. I'm over Karen, okay?

40:16.316 --> 40:17.751
I don't wanna be with her.

40:17.851 --> 40:19.253
So you're not gonna say
this to me again?

40:19.353 --> 40:21.021
No.
I'm not.

40:21.121 --> 40:23.857
Okay. Right.
That's what we not gonna do.

40:23.957 --> 40:25.425
What? Now we're not doing stuff.

40:25.526 --> 40:28.562
No. Zac, I'ma have
questions sometimes.

40:28.662 --> 40:30.731
And if I ask you
a thousand times,

40:30.831 --> 40:32.699
you're gonna answer
a thousand and one times until

40:32.799 --> 40:34.334
I'm comfortable with the shit.

40:34.434 --> 40:36.336
-Fatima.
-No, Zac.

40:36.436 --> 40:38.705
You don't get a choice on when
you wanna answer my questions

40:38.805 --> 40:41.308
on some shit that you brought
into our lives.

40:41.408 --> 40:44.378
-Fatima.
-No.

40:44.478 --> 40:48.282
Look, we in the gym.
Can I finish my workout, please?

40:48.382 --> 40:49.816
Can we do that?

40:49.917 --> 40:51.318
I know you just didn't.

40:51.418 --> 40:52.686
Didn't do what?

40:52.786 --> 40:54.054
See, that right there,
that's your last time

40:54.154 --> 40:55.956
on some shit that you
are responsible for.

40:56.056 --> 40:57.324
Oh God, bro.

40:57.424 --> 40:59.459
The last -- I asked was
he still in love with his ex,

40:59.560 --> 41:01.261
-he went and married her.
-I know that.

41:01.361 --> 41:03.497
-Yeah, and not long after that.
-But I'm not him.

41:03.597 --> 41:04.865
But this shit makes
me feel the same.

41:04.965 --> 41:06.800
So then what are we doing?

41:06.900 --> 41:08.101
What the -- you mean
what are we doing?

41:08.202 --> 41:10.671
You wanna ask me the same
question over and over

41:10.771 --> 41:12.039
and over again.
I wake up in the morning,

41:12.139 --> 41:13.540
are you in love with Karen?
I eat breakfast.

41:13.640 --> 41:14.942
Are you in love with Karen?
I eat lunch.

41:15.042 --> 41:17.177
Are you in love with Karen?
We --. You get happy.

41:17.277 --> 41:18.979
Then you go back to,
do you love Karen?

41:19.079 --> 41:22.783
I'm tired of doing that, okay?

41:22.883 --> 41:24.318
You're still in love with her.

41:24.418 --> 41:26.253
I'm not in love with her.

41:26.353 --> 41:29.323
Yes, you are.

41:29.423 --> 41:31.291
So what are we doing?
Are we really doing this?

41:31.391 --> 41:32.893
What the -- do you
mean what are we doing?

41:32.993 --> 41:36.296
-Are we doing this?
-Yes, we are.

41:36.396 --> 41:39.132
You know what, Karen?

41:41.368 --> 41:42.903
I meant Fa-

41:43.003 --> 41:44.605
What the -- did you
just say to me?

41:44.705 --> 41:46.273
Oh, God.

41:49.209 --> 41:51.178
[Andi] Next on "Sistas".

41:51.278 --> 41:52.713
-Can you spot me?
-No, I can't spot you.

41:52.813 --> 41:54.448
All right, can you help me do
this?

41:54.548 --> 41:57.050
Deja, I'm not. Deja, why you do
stuff, I'm gonna come undone.

41:57.150 --> 41:58.619
Okay.

41:58.719 --> 42:00.587
Maurice was good to you
and you go and do this to him.

42:00.687 --> 42:02.322
Well, he shouldn't
have been in on it.

42:02.422 --> 42:04.024
Rent free, rent free.

42:04.124 --> 42:06.193
Are you gonna be working
her nerves like you do mine?
