00:00.201 --> 00:03.168
(rhythmic music)

00:07.041 --> 00:09.341
(hawk calls)

00:34.135 --> 00:37.169
(atmospheric music)

02:00.788 --> 02:02.287
- Good morning.

02:09.697 --> 02:10.596
Morning.

02:14.201 --> 02:15.300
Morning!

02:19.140 --> 02:21.273
(laughs)

02:22.910 --> 02:24.209
Morning.

02:37.291 --> 02:41.860
Mm-mm, this one, hm?

02:54.642 --> 02:56.842
Good morning, Mr. Richard.

03:00.314 --> 03:02.247
(atmospheric piano music)

03:02.249 --> 03:02.948
- Karen.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.185
Good morning.

03:06.954 --> 03:08.687
It's lovely to see you.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.756
- It's lovely to see you, too.

03:10.758 --> 03:11.924
How you feeling today?

03:12.793 --> 03:14.293
- I'm good, thanks.

03:20.234 --> 03:22.234
- So, what are we writing?

03:26.307 --> 03:27.839
- Nothing special.

03:27.841 --> 03:30.275
It's just the ramblings
of an old madman.

03:31.278 --> 03:33.412
- Yeah, I've said this before.

03:33.414 --> 03:35.347
And I'm gonna say it again.

03:36.317 --> 03:38.317
You do not belong here.

03:43.958 --> 03:44.923
- Maybe not.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.365
But I'd rather be in here
than the alternative.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.602
- What's your alternative?

03:58.339 --> 04:02.908
- Death, doom, destruction.

04:08.649 --> 04:12.017
Now you're beginning
to rethink my sanity?

04:12.019 --> 04:14.653
- I think you
should write poetry.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.421
Dark poetry.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.423
- Well, you think I'm a loony,

04:20.327 --> 04:22.294
which is why I'm in here.

04:24.365 --> 04:26.698
- I still don't believe that.

04:26.700 --> 04:30.269
(atmospheric piano music)

04:33.774 --> 04:37.843
Mr. Richard, how did you
really end up in here?

04:43.517 --> 04:44.883
- You wouldn't believe me.

04:47.354 --> 04:49.488
Truth can be stranger
than fiction.

04:53.894 --> 04:56.595
- I just got off
work, so I have time.

04:58.032 --> 04:59.398
Let's talk.

04:59.400 --> 05:00.299
Try me.

05:05.072 --> 05:06.338
- All right.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.710
My story begins...

05:13.047 --> 05:16.415
It was early as my
first memory as a child.

05:17.551 --> 05:20.385
(dramatic music)

05:33.467 --> 05:34.366
- Richard?

05:36.870 --> 05:38.770
Richard, baby.

05:38.772 --> 05:39.838
It's time to get up.

05:41.075 --> 05:43.108
Hey, okay, come, up you get.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.976
Time to take your bath.

05:46.447 --> 05:47.379
My baby.

05:47.381 --> 05:48.480
Yeah.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.451
Ah, good morning, my baby.

05:54.421 --> 05:57.389
He's almost getting too heavy
for Mommy to carry, now.

06:02.363 --> 06:03.462
- An astronaut.

06:04.465 --> 06:05.364
Or a pilot.

06:06.767 --> 06:09.434
But I'm afraid of heights.

06:09.436 --> 06:10.135
So, no.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.972
- [Sylvia] If you want,
we could fix that.

06:15.609 --> 06:17.075
- Oh.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.910
- We could fly, or even better.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.480
We could go to space.

06:22.483 --> 06:24.716
Everything is possible
here, Richard.

06:24.718 --> 06:27.419
Say the word, I'll
make it happen.

06:28.789 --> 06:31.390
- It sounds like you just
want to see me throw up.

06:31.392 --> 06:33.825
I'll make sure it matter first.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.163
(Richard sighs)

06:38.165 --> 06:40.499
Ah, Sylvia, I almost forgot.

06:41.835 --> 06:44.936
I'm having serious issues
with my math homework.

06:44.938 --> 06:45.904
I asked Mom, but--

06:45.906 --> 06:47.406
- Already solved.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.449
- Thank you, Sylvia.

06:57.451 --> 06:59.918
Sometimes, I wonder what
I would do without you.

07:00.687 --> 07:01.887
- You're welcome.

07:01.889 --> 07:03.622
No big deal, really.

07:05.526 --> 07:08.493
- Someone's about to
wake me up, right?

07:08.495 --> 07:11.163
(bell ringing)

07:14.201 --> 07:17.002
- Come to me as soon
as you can, okay?

07:18.005 --> 07:19.771
(bells ringing)

07:19.773 --> 07:21.006
(clanging)

07:21.008 --> 07:22.874
- [Richard] Yes, what is it?

07:22.876 --> 07:25.444
- (speaking in foreign language)
Don't you hear the bell?

07:25.446 --> 07:30.515
Get up now. (speaking
in foreign language)

07:31.919 --> 07:33.852
I'll save you a spot behind me
on the queue if you hurry up.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.755
(door slams)

07:36.757 --> 07:38.723
(atmospheric piano music)

07:38.725 --> 07:42.494
(atmospheric vocal music)

08:09.623 --> 08:12.624
- [Richard] I just
really miss her.

08:15.229 --> 08:16.661
- You should, Richard.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.132
She was an amazing woman.

08:30.577 --> 08:32.043
- I don't get it.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.047
The potion that you gave me

08:38.085 --> 08:39.618
and asked me to give her.

08:41.587 --> 08:42.754
Why didn't it work?

08:43.756 --> 08:45.123
Why didn't she get better?

08:45.926 --> 08:47.526
- I don't know, Richard.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.698
I guess it was her time to go.

08:57.204 --> 09:01.006
There are some things that
even I don't have control over.

09:11.618 --> 09:16.688
- Yes, at least
she's at rest now.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.560
- She got to see you graduate,

09:24.998 --> 09:29.568
get your Master's, a great job,

09:31.204 --> 09:33.572
and finally move
into your own place.

09:35.809 --> 09:39.144
She was more than impressed
with you, Richard.

09:41.014 --> 09:42.647
She was proud.

09:42.649 --> 09:45.283
(violin music)

09:46.587 --> 09:51.323
- I don't suppose
your powers include

09:52.326 --> 09:53.858
the power of
resurrecting people?

09:53.860 --> 09:56.695
(violin music)

10:04.738 --> 10:05.804
I guess not.

10:08.108 --> 10:11.009
(Richard sobbing)

10:20.354 --> 10:22.153
- You have to leave soon.

10:27.928 --> 10:29.628
You have to leave soon.

10:31.798 --> 10:32.697
- Why?

10:34.067 --> 10:37.235
- Because you drank a little
too much water last night,

10:38.372 --> 10:43.008
and it's almost
6:00 a.m, your time.

10:43.010 --> 10:46.044
(Richard sniffling)

10:56.156 --> 10:59.190
- I've been meaning to ask you
why you keep giving me these.

11:02.429 --> 11:04.262
- Because it matters to me.

11:05.332 --> 11:09.300
(atmospheric orchestral music)

11:13.273 --> 11:15.340
- You matter to me.

11:15.342 --> 11:19.344
(atmospheric orchestral music)

11:40.734 --> 11:43.334
(alarm blares)

12:01.888 --> 12:04.823
(clock ticking)

12:10.964 --> 12:12.764
- Nobody drink yet.

12:12.766 --> 12:16.101
First, a toast, hm?

12:18.505 --> 12:21.506
Here's to one of the
brightest, most resourceful,

12:21.508 --> 12:25.210
talented minds I have had
the pleasure of working with.

12:25.212 --> 12:27.178
Richard Okezie,

12:27.180 --> 12:30.882
who landed us our largest
account yet, Zephyr Heights.

12:30.884 --> 12:31.983
Let him hear it!

12:31.985 --> 12:33.151
(crowd cheers)

12:33.153 --> 12:34.219
Yes, yes, yes.

12:35.288 --> 12:38.890
And to me, for
being crazy enough

12:38.892 --> 12:41.392
to put this rookie on the board.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.828
(Richard laughs)

12:43.830 --> 12:47.832
- To our very own Don
Draper, Mr. Temidayo Davies.

12:47.834 --> 12:49.534
- Ah, please stop.

12:49.536 --> 12:52.003
- Save a letter for you.

12:52.005 --> 12:53.538
- Come on, calm down.

12:53.540 --> 12:57.041
We're here to celebrate
Richard over here, not me.

12:57.043 --> 12:58.810
I mean, who am I anyway?

12:58.812 --> 13:01.513
Only the man that can fire
each and every one of you.

13:02.816 --> 13:05.216
(laughs) I know I
am talking too much,

13:05.218 --> 13:07.886
because some of you alcoholics
want a drink really badly.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.120
I see you, John.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.122
Patience, okay?

13:11.124 --> 13:13.825
Just one last thing,
and that'll be it, hm?

13:13.827 --> 13:16.828
Please don't spill
anything on my floor.

13:18.165 --> 13:21.800
Or I will fire you, that's
a promise, all right?

13:21.802 --> 13:22.500
To Richard!

13:22.502 --> 13:23.935
- [All] To Richard!

13:23.937 --> 13:25.503
- Well done.

13:25.505 --> 13:26.538
Lemme talk to you real quick.

13:26.540 --> 13:29.841
(glasses clinking)

13:29.843 --> 13:31.576
- Thanks, guys.

13:31.578 --> 13:32.577
- Well done.

13:32.579 --> 13:33.545
Drink up.

13:33.547 --> 13:35.280
Richard, my man.

13:35.282 --> 13:36.181
Well done.

13:36.183 --> 13:37.415
- Thank you.

13:37.417 --> 13:38.349
- You know what?

13:38.351 --> 13:40.585
Go ahead and take the day off.

13:40.587 --> 13:41.970
- Are you serious?

13:41.971 --> 13:43.354
- Yes, go ahead and
take the day off.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.924
Believe me, you have earned it.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.642
Besides, it is Friday,

13:47.643 --> 13:49.359
so no harm in starting
the weekend early, hm?

13:49.362 --> 13:50.295
- Oh, I'll drink to that.

13:50.297 --> 13:52.330
- Yes, sir, a drink to that!

13:52.332 --> 13:53.264
- All right!

13:53.266 --> 13:55.099
- (laughs) Richard, my man.

13:56.102 --> 13:58.837
Mm, gotta sip on it.

13:58.839 --> 14:02.841
(singing in foreign language)

14:10.250 --> 14:12.617
- [Richard] Hey, how
you doing, all right?

14:12.619 --> 14:13.918
- [Server] Yes.

14:14.855 --> 14:16.120
- Do you have plantain?

14:16.122 --> 14:17.021
- Yes, I do.

14:18.325 --> 14:21.426
- I'll have some fried rice.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.530
- What would you like?

14:27.167 --> 14:30.935
(gentle orchestral music)

14:32.339 --> 14:33.171
Yes, sir?

14:33.173 --> 14:34.973
Fried rice with what?

14:38.345 --> 14:42.280
Excuse me, sir?

14:42.282 --> 14:44.082
Excuse me, sir?

14:44.084 --> 14:44.949
- Fried rice.

14:44.951 --> 14:45.984
- Just fried rice?

14:45.986 --> 14:46.885
- Sorry.

14:48.355 --> 14:52.390
Fried rice with
plantain and beef.

14:52.392 --> 14:53.558
- And beef?
- Yeah.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.560
- [Server] Coming right away.

14:55.562 --> 14:56.961
- And some water.

14:56.963 --> 14:58.062
- Okay, sir.

14:58.932 --> 15:02.433
(gentle orchestral music)

15:16.917 --> 15:17.615
- Hi.

15:21.321 --> 15:22.186
- Hey.

15:23.657 --> 15:24.923
- Do you mind if I--

15:26.660 --> 15:27.558
- Sure.

15:33.466 --> 15:36.200
(tray clatters)

15:37.971 --> 15:39.070
- Sorry.

15:41.942 --> 15:43.708
Forgive me for staring.

15:43.710 --> 15:44.609
It's just...

15:47.547 --> 15:50.014
You must think
I'm really creepy.

15:50.016 --> 15:53.017
- (laughs) You're in luck.

15:55.355 --> 15:57.355
I'm really creepy, too.

15:58.124 --> 16:00.258
(laughs)

16:02.395 --> 16:07.465
- So, beauty and
a sense of humor?

16:08.001 --> 16:10.435
Richard Okezie.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.137
- Gbemi Ogunlana.

16:17.177 --> 16:20.044
- Gbemi, it's so
nice to meet you.

16:22.716 --> 16:26.551
- [Sylvia] So, you like her?

16:27.687 --> 16:29.620
- [Richard] I think
that's not accurate.

16:31.992 --> 16:35.159
I love her! (laughs)

16:35.161 --> 16:39.063
- So, what about us?

16:40.100 --> 16:41.766
- [Richard] What about us?

16:41.768 --> 16:44.302
- What we have, silly!

16:44.304 --> 16:49.374
(wind chimes clanging)
(atmospheric music)

16:50.777 --> 16:51.776
- What do we have?

16:54.080 --> 16:55.313
- How can you say that?

17:01.021 --> 17:02.153
- Look, Sylvia.

17:02.155 --> 17:06.391
You of all people should've
known that this day will come.

17:07.727 --> 17:10.528
- How am I supposed to know
that the day would come

17:10.530 --> 17:14.031
where you would fall in
love with somebody else?

17:15.201 --> 17:18.435
- What did you expect, that
I would settle down with you?

17:19.271 --> 17:20.570
Have kids with you?

17:22.342 --> 17:23.540
You're not even real.

17:23.542 --> 17:26.176
(Sylvia gasps)

17:33.119 --> 17:34.786
- How can you say that, Richard?

17:37.123 --> 17:41.125
After everything, how could
you honestly say that?

17:49.436 --> 17:50.334
Richard.

17:53.173 --> 17:56.407
Richard, look at me.

17:56.409 --> 17:59.143
Look at me, Richard, look at me.

17:59.145 --> 18:01.512
Look me in the eye and tell me

18:03.149 --> 18:05.149
that this isn't real.

18:06.820 --> 18:09.120
Tell me that we're not fated.

18:11.524 --> 18:15.159
Tell me that we're not meant
to be together, Richard.

18:15.161 --> 18:15.860
Lie to me.

18:17.163 --> 18:18.229
- I'm sorry.

18:24.370 --> 18:25.570
Fine.

18:25.571 --> 18:26.771
Let's assume that it's all real.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.573
Even for a moment,
what did you expect,

18:28.575 --> 18:32.110
that I'm gonna just
leave everything

18:32.112 --> 18:34.479
and come out here,

18:35.582 --> 18:39.517
start a family with
you, be with you?

18:42.188 --> 18:45.123
What about my other life?

18:45.125 --> 18:49.193
My real life, the real world?

18:49.195 --> 18:51.662
Am I supposed to just
spend all the time sleeping

18:51.664 --> 18:53.564
just to be here with you?

18:53.566 --> 18:54.499
Sylvia.

18:54.501 --> 18:55.633
- What's wrong with the way

18:55.635 --> 18:57.702
that we've been
spending time together?

18:57.704 --> 18:58.603
- Sylvia!

19:02.642 --> 19:04.509
It's not gonna work,
it has to stop.

19:05.778 --> 19:08.246
(somber orchestral music)

19:08.248 --> 19:10.815
(Sylvia sobs)

19:13.686 --> 19:14.785
- Don't touch me!

19:17.824 --> 19:19.690
I'm not real, right?

19:22.529 --> 19:27.598
So why are you feeling sorry
for me if I am not real?

19:32.705 --> 19:35.373
I'm just somebody that you used.

19:38.678 --> 19:42.780
After everything that we
have together, Richard.

19:44.918 --> 19:46.284
You'd throw that away?

19:50.223 --> 19:54.325
I may not be a real woman,

19:55.428 --> 19:58.896
but you will never
find anyone like me.

20:04.637 --> 20:07.305
- Sylvia, I didn't--

20:07.307 --> 20:08.673
- It's 6:00 a.m., Richard.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.442
You need to leave.

20:11.444 --> 20:14.745
(wind chimes clanging)

20:18.985 --> 20:20.985
(Sylvia sighs)

20:20.987 --> 20:21.886
- Hey.

20:24.757 --> 20:26.224
Stop crying.

20:26.226 --> 20:29.594
(somber orchestral music)

20:42.542 --> 20:46.310
(Sylvia and Richard sobbing)

20:49.682 --> 20:52.883
Just so sorry. (sniffles)

20:52.885 --> 20:56.420
(somber orchestral music)

22:03.356 --> 22:05.923
(piano music)

22:08.461 --> 22:09.360
Richard...

22:12.432 --> 22:16.100
it's just a dream.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.106
Get a--

22:22.108 --> 22:23.708
- Grip on yourself, man!

22:26.379 --> 22:29.113
Dude, I've seen the
way you look at her.

22:30.416 --> 22:32.116
I've seen how she
makes you feel.

22:33.453 --> 22:35.019
You're a complete
fool around her.

22:36.789 --> 22:38.656
You know what that means, right?

22:38.658 --> 22:40.458
(singing in foreign language)

22:40.460 --> 22:41.892
- No, Obaro, what does it mean?

22:41.894 --> 22:42.793
Tell me.

22:45.365 --> 22:46.597
- It means she's the one.

22:48.601 --> 22:51.469
You know, the one?

22:52.405 --> 22:53.437
Like Neil,

22:54.741 --> 22:57.942
except with boobs and nice legs.

22:57.944 --> 22:59.110
- Hey!

22:59.112 --> 23:01.412
- Round ass.
- Hey!

23:01.413 --> 23:03.713
All right, that's my wife-to-be
you're talking about.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.483
- Well, there it is!

23:05.485 --> 23:06.417
Huh?

23:06.419 --> 23:07.118
That's what I'm talking about!

23:07.120 --> 23:08.586
- [Richard] Yeah.

23:08.588 --> 23:10.388
- Dude, I thought I'd
lost you for a second.

23:10.390 --> 23:13.491
(laughs) And I was
beginning to wonder,

23:14.627 --> 23:17.561
wondering if you were
gay or something.

23:19.399 --> 23:21.465
- Why would you
think that I'm gay?

23:21.467 --> 23:22.800
- It's not like I have
anything against gay people,

23:22.802 --> 23:23.768
I'm just saying.

23:24.804 --> 23:26.470
This is where teenagers come

23:27.740 --> 23:30.441
if they haven't really
been interested in girls.

23:30.443 --> 23:32.877
- Yeah, well, I'm getting
married to one now, okay?

23:34.013 --> 23:35.613
Does not convince you
that I'm straight?

23:35.615 --> 23:37.515
I'm straight as it gets.

23:37.517 --> 23:40.818
- (laughs) No, it
doesn't convince me,

23:40.820 --> 23:44.522
'cause this is Lagos, and
there are a lot of married men

23:44.524 --> 23:45.756
running around with kids

23:45.758 --> 23:47.858
and still keeping
houseboys and stuff.

23:51.197 --> 23:52.196
- Really?

23:52.197 --> 23:53.196
How do you know all this stuff?

23:53.199 --> 23:56.066
I'm beginning to wonder
if you're straight.

23:56.068 --> 23:59.470
- (laughs) Me?

23:59.472 --> 24:00.504
Obaro?

24:01.674 --> 24:04.008
I'm straighter than your ruler.

24:05.645 --> 24:08.679
I'm so straight,
can't get any gayer.

24:08.681 --> 24:11.148
(both laugh)

24:11.951 --> 24:12.783
- Madman!

24:12.785 --> 24:13.784
- Oh, man!

24:16.122 --> 24:17.188
- Oh, Obaro.

24:18.591 --> 24:19.690
I'm getting married.

24:21.227 --> 24:22.493
- That's it.

24:24.664 --> 24:29.099
- I am getting married to
the most incredible woman

24:30.536 --> 24:32.603
that I've ever actually met.

24:33.539 --> 24:35.673
- And don't you forget it,

24:35.675 --> 24:39.143
'cause if you do, you know
what's gonna happen, right?

24:39.145 --> 24:42.112
I'm gonna slide right in,
take care of that ass for you.

24:43.983 --> 24:48.552
That's what's gonna
happen. (laughs)

24:48.554 --> 24:49.820
Oh, goodness.

24:49.822 --> 24:51.222
- You know what?

24:54.894 --> 24:56.527
I'm marrying Gbemi.

24:57.563 --> 24:58.662
It's final.

25:00.566 --> 25:03.534
(speaking in foreign language)

25:03.536 --> 25:04.768
Bro.

25:04.770 --> 25:06.237
- What are you doing?

25:07.607 --> 25:08.606
- I gotta--

25:09.242 --> 25:10.508
- Dude, it's not even 10 yet.

25:10.510 --> 25:11.775
- I know.

25:11.777 --> 25:13.944
- Okay, one for the
road, just one shot?

25:13.946 --> 25:14.979
Do a shot before you leave?

25:14.981 --> 25:16.146
- No.

25:16.148 --> 25:17.081
- You're not gonna
leave me here by myself.

25:17.083 --> 25:18.048
- Come on, you'll be fine.

25:18.050 --> 25:18.983
- Richard!

25:20.853 --> 25:22.219
- [Richard] See you later, man.

25:22.220 --> 25:23.586
(singing in foreign language)

25:23.589 --> 25:26.524
- I need new friends,
that's what it is.

25:28.594 --> 25:30.594
- This is on the house.

25:34.600 --> 25:35.533
- Thank you.

25:35.535 --> 25:39.236
(singing in foreign language)

25:53.085 --> 25:57.821
This, trying to
mess up my night.

25:58.991 --> 26:00.958
That is not about
to happen here.

26:07.333 --> 26:10.668
(atmospheric music)

26:14.307 --> 26:17.608
(wind chimes clanging)

26:22.181 --> 26:24.982
(dramatic music)

26:29.355 --> 26:33.724
- I came to tell you that
this has to end, Sylvia.

26:38.698 --> 26:39.697
I'm getting married to her

26:39.699 --> 26:41.665
next Saturday.
- I know that.

26:41.667 --> 26:44.268
(dramatic music)

26:49.809 --> 26:52.242
If I'm not real,

26:53.746 --> 26:56.847
it shouldn't matter
what you do with me

26:58.818 --> 27:02.720
and to me in your dreams.

27:05.958 --> 27:07.958
- Sylvia, I'm sorry.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.760
I know that we had
some good times,

27:11.998 --> 27:13.797
but things have changed.

27:13.799 --> 27:16.734
- Richard, nothing
has to change.

27:16.736 --> 27:19.269
We can just stay here.

27:25.044 --> 27:26.710
- You know what, I've
made me decision,

27:26.712 --> 27:27.811
and I'm sticking to it.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.682
Quite frankly, I don't care
if you plague my dreams

27:31.684 --> 27:33.350
every night for the
rest of my life.

27:35.021 --> 27:35.853
- [Sylvia] Please.

27:35.855 --> 27:36.754
- I am marrying Gbemi.

27:37.990 --> 27:38.889
I love her.

27:39.892 --> 27:41.125
- [Sylvia] Please,

27:41.127 --> 27:42.693
take it!
- And that's that.

27:42.695 --> 27:43.394
- [Sylvia] Please
Richard, take it.

27:43.396 --> 27:44.662
- No.

27:44.664 --> 27:45.295
- You have to!

27:45.297 --> 27:46.664
- No, I don't!

27:46.666 --> 27:49.299
- Take it, Richard,
please! (sobs)

27:49.301 --> 27:50.234
You don't understand.

27:50.236 --> 27:51.702
If you don't take it, then,

27:53.072 --> 27:54.438
you have to.
- Then what?

27:54.440 --> 27:56.140
You what?

27:56.142 --> 27:57.374
- If you don't take it,

27:57.376 --> 27:59.109
then I might not
be able to see you.

27:59.111 --> 28:00.010
- Might?

28:01.681 --> 28:02.379
Or won't?

28:05.785 --> 28:08.986
- I love you, Richard.

28:12.825 --> 28:16.193
From the first day you
took your first breath,

28:16.195 --> 28:18.696
I have loved you.

28:21.701 --> 28:24.768
I haven't loved anybody else.

28:24.770 --> 28:25.469
Richard.

28:26.806 --> 28:30.808
You are mine, and
nothing and nobody

28:30.810 --> 28:34.178
is going to take that away
from me, do you understand?

28:34.180 --> 28:35.179
I love you.

28:36.982 --> 28:41.251
So you can go and you can
get married to someone else,

28:42.354 --> 28:45.389
you get to try and
live your life,

28:46.792 --> 28:49.326
but I will always find my
way back into your heart.

28:52.431 --> 28:55.466
Oh, I will use the whole
of eternity trying.

28:56.736 --> 28:58.836
Do you understand?

28:58.838 --> 29:00.137
- I might understand

29:02.174 --> 29:03.974
that if I don't
take that from you,

29:06.245 --> 29:07.778
I won't see you again.

29:10.883 --> 29:12.282
- [Sylvia] Please.

29:12.284 --> 29:13.450
- I'll take that as a yes.

29:13.452 --> 29:15.085
- Take it.

29:15.087 --> 29:16.787
Richard, please!
- I am done

29:16.789 --> 29:17.855
with this madness!

29:17.857 --> 29:19.022
- Please!

29:19.024 --> 29:23.160
Richard! (sobs)

29:40.346 --> 29:43.147
(dramatic music)

29:56.562 --> 29:59.296
(Sylvia laughs)

30:14.947 --> 30:17.881
(clock ticking)

30:24.557 --> 30:28.892
- I don't know why you don't
like reading the soft copies.

30:28.894 --> 30:33.263
- Because I like the
feel of paper. (laughs)

30:34.166 --> 30:35.899
Is that coffee I smell?

30:35.901 --> 30:38.468
- [Hawa] Strong and hot,
just the way you like it.

30:42.541 --> 30:44.208
- How did you know
I needed this?

30:51.083 --> 30:51.949
It's perfect.

30:53.319 --> 30:55.485
- Well, I aim to please.

30:55.487 --> 30:56.353
The doomsayer.

30:58.157 --> 30:59.389
- Thank you.

30:59.391 --> 31:01.325
- So, is there anything else

31:01.327 --> 31:03.193
you want me to do you for, sir?

31:04.396 --> 31:06.630
(dramatic music)

31:06.632 --> 31:09.967
- Yes, as a matter
of fact, there is.

31:11.136 --> 31:13.604
I want you...

31:13.606 --> 31:16.340
(clock ticking)

31:18.644 --> 31:21.411
to help me call a
very good florist.

31:21.413 --> 31:25.616
Have him deliver a bouquet
of flowers to my wife.

31:25.618 --> 31:27.618
- Little problem, Mr. Okezie.

31:27.620 --> 31:31.555
- And I want it
delivered to her at work.

31:31.557 --> 31:32.923
- [Hawa] Okay.

31:32.925 --> 31:34.658
- So, here's the address,

31:34.660 --> 31:38.061
and here's the message
I want on the card.

31:39.365 --> 31:40.530
She's gonna love this.

31:47.139 --> 31:50.207
- To the reason my
life is worth living.

31:50.209 --> 31:54.011
P.S., honeymoon tonight.

31:54.013 --> 31:55.646
Wow, lucky woman.

31:56.982 --> 31:58.949
I thought you already
had your honeymoon.

31:58.951 --> 32:00.050
- Boundaries, Hawa.

32:02.221 --> 32:05.689
- Yeah, and I'll
leave you to it.

32:09.328 --> 32:14.031
Oh, what kind of flowers
do you want sent to her?

32:14.033 --> 32:16.466
- Just have the
florist surprise us.

32:16.468 --> 32:19.002
Oh, but I do know
that she only likes

32:19.004 --> 32:20.537
one type of flower
in her bouquet.

32:20.539 --> 32:22.139
Make sure he gets that.

32:22.141 --> 32:27.210
- Okay, sir.

32:28.948 --> 32:32.049
Good day, Mrs. Iweta.

32:32.051 --> 32:33.417
- Good day, Hawa.

32:33.419 --> 32:34.985
I take it he is in.

32:34.987 --> 32:37.287
- Oh, I'm afraid
Mr. Okezie isn't in.

32:37.289 --> 32:39.056
- So I see.

32:39.058 --> 32:41.358
You have a habit of
just shoving your head

32:41.360 --> 32:43.694
into his office and
talking to thin air?

32:43.696 --> 32:46.496
- Actually, my psychotherapist
says it's unhealthy

32:46.498 --> 32:48.098
to act sane all the time.

32:49.702 --> 32:52.736
- It is a wonder that
you can be so successful,

32:52.738 --> 32:54.638
considering the shoddy way

32:54.640 --> 32:58.141
assistant's handling his
services to his clientele.

32:59.311 --> 33:00.744
- Actually, we are
very successful,

33:00.746 --> 33:03.080
considering we
don't talk this way

33:03.082 --> 33:04.514
to people who actually matter.

33:07.987 --> 33:10.153
- Your insolence, young lady,

33:10.155 --> 33:12.689
may have just cost
No Box Incorporated

33:12.691 --> 33:15.225
one of its biggest clients.

33:15.227 --> 33:19.029
- If you'll excuse me, ma'am,
I'm very busy right now.

33:19.031 --> 33:21.565
I'll be sure to tell Mr. Okezie
that you swore on the Bible.

33:21.567 --> 33:23.367
Please book an
appointment next time

33:23.369 --> 33:26.403
so that you don't
waste your time.

33:26.405 --> 33:27.304
Good day.

33:29.074 --> 33:32.142
(keyboard clacking)

33:33.012 --> 33:33.710
- Oh.

33:40.319 --> 33:44.221
- [Gbemi] May I have
the drainer please?

33:44.223 --> 33:46.156
- I am so exhausted.

33:46.158 --> 33:47.324
Where do you want that?

33:47.326 --> 33:48.458
- There, that's fine.

33:48.460 --> 33:49.626
- Can we swap jobs?

33:49.628 --> 33:50.460
(Gbemi laughs)

33:50.462 --> 33:51.762
No really, come on.

33:51.764 --> 33:52.763
Hm?

33:52.765 --> 33:54.765
I'd kill to be home by 4:30.

33:54.767 --> 33:56.800
I'd cook, I'd even cook,
I'd do the cooking.

33:56.802 --> 33:58.535
- Nope, you love your job.

34:00.105 --> 34:01.204
And I love my kids.

34:04.643 --> 34:05.659
- True.

34:05.660 --> 34:06.676
You left one more person out.

34:06.678 --> 34:07.511
- Hm?

34:07.513 --> 34:08.344
- Come on!

34:08.347 --> 34:09.379
- Who is that?

34:09.380 --> 34:10.280
- It's not obvious?

34:10.282 --> 34:11.313
- Who?
- Me.

34:11.315 --> 34:12.649
- (laughs) You?

34:12.650 --> 34:14.184
- You love me?

34:15.320 --> 34:17.087
- Hm, no.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.255
Not even a little bit.

34:19.257 --> 34:20.157
- Liar.

34:26.598 --> 34:27.731
- How's work?

34:29.168 --> 34:31.735
- (sighs) I don't know.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.237
Kinda hit a stumbling blow.

34:34.239 --> 34:35.105
- Yeah?

34:35.107 --> 34:38.542
- I'm having issues
trying to come up with

34:38.543 --> 34:42.212
direction of taking the
new Zephyr Heights company.

34:42.214 --> 34:44.380
And it's doing me in.

34:44.382 --> 34:45.782
- Anything I can do to help?

34:45.784 --> 34:46.683
- Mm-hmm.

34:49.455 --> 34:52.222
Love me.

34:52.224 --> 34:53.123
Feed me.

34:54.092 --> 34:55.092
(Gbemi laughs)

34:55.094 --> 34:56.760
Never leave me.

34:56.762 --> 34:59.529
(Gbemi laughs)

34:59.531 --> 35:01.164
- That, I can do.

35:04.470 --> 35:07.170
- So, what are we having?

35:09.174 --> 35:10.707
I'm really hungry, I'm starving.

35:10.709 --> 35:12.676
You know, the kind
of starving that's--

35:12.678 --> 35:15.879
(dramatic music)

35:15.881 --> 35:18.815
- [Gbemi] Richard, what's wrong?

35:21.687 --> 35:25.589
- Baby, they sent
you red hibiscuses?

35:25.591 --> 35:27.124
- [Gbemi] Mm-hmm.

35:27.126 --> 35:29.459
Clearly, you didn't
choose which ones.

35:29.461 --> 35:31.161
(dramatic music)

35:31.163 --> 35:33.330
- No, it's not that,

35:33.332 --> 35:36.166
it's just I don't know
anything about flowers.

35:37.236 --> 35:38.886
But these don't
look fresh, though.

35:38.887 --> 35:40.537
I think we should
throw them out.

35:40.539 --> 35:42.239
I'll make new arrangements.

35:42.241 --> 35:44.608
- You just said you knew
nothing about flowers, silly.

35:44.610 --> 35:45.909
They're fine.

35:45.911 --> 35:48.912
(dramatic music)

35:58.857 --> 36:02.492
- Quite frankly, sir, I
don't think I understand.

36:02.494 --> 36:04.227
- How do I make this clearer?

36:05.697 --> 36:08.398
This, it's not what
we're looking for.

36:10.402 --> 36:13.470
- Help me understand exactly
what your company wants.

36:13.472 --> 36:14.804
- We've already told you.

36:14.806 --> 36:16.306
Understated elegance.

36:18.177 --> 36:21.378
- Which is exactly what my team
and I have prepared for you.

36:22.814 --> 36:24.581
Did you only look at the files,

36:24.583 --> 36:27.217
or were you able to look
at the email presentation?

36:28.554 --> 36:31.321
- We've seen the presentation
and the files, Mr. Okezie.

36:31.323 --> 36:33.790
Whatever elegance may be in
the campaign you came up with

36:33.792 --> 36:35.458
is a little too understated.

36:35.460 --> 36:38.828
- So, you'd rather have it
a little less understated?

36:39.965 --> 36:42.232
- All I know is,
you're the ad guy,

36:42.234 --> 36:44.201
and we hired you to
make us look good.

36:44.203 --> 36:46.336
We all agree, we
don't like this pitch.

36:46.338 --> 36:47.470
Figure it out.

36:49.908 --> 36:51.708
- I'm very sure
that my team and I

36:51.709 --> 36:53.509
can come up with something
that suits Zephyr.

36:55.514 --> 36:57.247
- Tick-tock, no
pressure, though.

37:05.324 --> 37:07.857
(Richard sighs)

37:11.563 --> 37:13.964
- You know about my kid
I'm always telling you

37:13.966 --> 37:15.899
is good at everything
else but math?

37:15.901 --> 37:19.002
He did so well on his test
today, I was so excited.

37:19.004 --> 37:22.339
(somber piano music)

37:24.309 --> 37:25.408
That bad?

37:28.313 --> 37:31.281
(somber piano music)

37:36.822 --> 37:37.721
- Thank you.

37:40.692 --> 37:44.995
He diplomatically told
me that it was crap.

37:49.268 --> 37:50.400
- [Gbemi] Oh, darling.

37:52.404 --> 37:54.471
(sighs)

37:56.041 --> 37:59.409
Do you want to bounce
some ideas off me?

37:59.411 --> 38:03.446
- That's the thing,
there's nothing to bounce.

38:04.316 --> 38:05.682
(sighs) It's like I'm blocked.

38:07.019 --> 38:08.685
And I need to get
over this soon,

38:08.687 --> 38:12.589
because I can literally feel
the clients getting cold feet.

38:17.829 --> 38:19.846
It would be so bad

38:19.847 --> 38:21.864
if we celebrated getting
that account for nothing.

38:24.303 --> 38:26.836
I was so sure they
would love that pitch.

38:31.910 --> 38:36.313
- (sighs) Maybe you just need to

38:36.315 --> 38:40.050
get it off of your
mind for a while.

38:40.052 --> 38:41.451
Huh?

38:41.453 --> 38:43.453
- I don't have a while.

38:47.626 --> 38:50.727
- You'll figure it out, okay?

38:50.729 --> 38:53.797
(atmospheric music)

39:30.802 --> 39:33.536
(Richard sighs)

40:02.000 --> 40:04.801
(dramatic music)

41:00.559 --> 41:05.595
(dramatic music)
(wind chimes clanging)

41:12.070 --> 41:13.136
- It worked.

41:14.473 --> 41:17.140
(crow cawing)

41:17.142 --> 41:19.976
(dramatic music)

41:33.525 --> 41:36.125
(Richard coughs)

41:38.930 --> 41:42.198
(birds chirping)

41:42.200 --> 41:45.502
(wind chimes clanging)

41:50.642 --> 41:54.143
Come on, before I have
to pee or something.

41:55.614 --> 41:56.613
Where are you?

41:58.550 --> 42:01.551
(Richard panting)

42:12.531 --> 42:13.863
Sylvia!

42:13.865 --> 42:15.698
- Keep it down.

42:15.700 --> 42:17.934
- (gasps) You scared me!

42:19.638 --> 42:21.538
(crow cawing)

42:21.540 --> 42:23.540
I've been looking
all over for you.

42:25.810 --> 42:26.709
- Really?

42:28.213 --> 42:32.615
So, now I'm wondering
if you are real,

42:33.652 --> 42:35.785
and I'm the one who's dreaming.

42:40.992 --> 42:41.891
- Hi.

42:43.662 --> 42:46.129
- Well, what do you want?

42:47.132 --> 42:48.298
I've got things to do.

42:49.301 --> 42:50.567
- Look, Sylvia.

42:51.603 --> 42:52.735
I'm sorry.

42:54.706 --> 42:57.006
(sighs) I didn't
even know if this,

42:57.008 --> 42:59.576
any of this, was gonna work.

43:02.781 --> 43:03.880
I just had a feeling.

43:05.350 --> 43:06.849
How come you didn't know?

43:08.153 --> 43:10.620
- Believe it or not, Richard,

43:10.622 --> 43:13.690
I don't know everything.

43:17.896 --> 43:20.597
- Yeah, that's hard to believe.

43:20.599 --> 43:23.600
- But I am learning
some new things.

43:23.602 --> 43:24.701
- Really?

43:25.637 --> 43:26.736
Like?

43:29.641 --> 43:32.842
- Like how you didn't come
here because you missed me.

43:34.613 --> 43:37.747
So, whatever it
is that you want,

43:38.383 --> 43:40.950
get to the point.

43:44.255 --> 43:45.388
- Okay.

43:45.390 --> 43:48.858
(dramatic music)

43:48.860 --> 43:49.826
I need your help.

43:51.830 --> 43:54.964
- You have the nerve, Richard,

43:54.966 --> 43:58.067
to come here and
ask me for help,

43:58.069 --> 43:59.669
after what you did!

44:02.173 --> 44:03.406
- I am sorry.

44:04.643 --> 44:06.709
I am beyond sorry.

44:09.781 --> 44:14.017
- I guess you don't
feel insane, right?

44:16.855 --> 44:21.658
Talking to a figment
of your imagination.

44:24.362 --> 44:28.998
(laughs)
(crow cawing)

44:32.437 --> 44:35.004
- This was a bad idea.

44:35.006 --> 44:36.906
I don't even know
what I was thinking.

44:40.745 --> 44:42.345
(Richard sighs)

44:42.347 --> 44:43.680
- What if I was real?

44:46.284 --> 44:48.051
Would you have
married me instead?

44:51.423 --> 44:53.256
- Perhaps, I don't know.

44:59.431 --> 45:01.464
- Change the color of
the Zephyr presentation

45:01.466 --> 45:06.736
from blue to red, let a
woman do the voiceovers,

45:08.707 --> 45:10.873
and replace the word
grandeur with luxury.

45:14.446 --> 45:17.747
(wind chimes clanging)

45:29.360 --> 45:30.259
- Thank you.

45:33.264 --> 45:34.864
- You have to wake up now.

45:37.001 --> 45:40.236
- Aren't you going to
give me a hibiscus?

45:43.408 --> 45:45.007
- Turns out I don't have to.

45:45.810 --> 45:48.811
(dramatic music)

45:53.985 --> 45:55.351
(crow cawing)

45:55.353 --> 45:58.087
(Richard gasps)

46:09.400 --> 46:12.201
(car horn honks)

46:14.839 --> 46:17.373
(Richard sighs)

46:18.443 --> 46:21.511
(keyboard clacking)

46:23.148 --> 46:25.915
(phone rings)

46:28.820 --> 46:30.319
- Yes, Hawa?

46:30.321 --> 46:31.921
- [Hawa] Mr. Hassan, line one.

46:35.326 --> 46:37.460
- Yeah, fine, put him through.

46:37.462 --> 46:38.361
- [Hawa] Okay.

46:42.867 --> 46:44.834
- (sighs) Hello, Mr. Hassan.

46:44.836 --> 46:47.103
- [Mr. Hassan] Richard,
this is much better.

46:49.541 --> 46:50.540
- Thank you, sir.

46:51.543 --> 46:53.109
- [Mr. Hassan] I
owe you a drink.

46:53.111 --> 46:55.344
- That won't be necessary, sir.

46:55.346 --> 46:56.279
- [Mr. Hassan] I have to say,

46:56.281 --> 46:58.881
this is work very well done.

46:58.883 --> 47:00.433
I just want to let you know

47:00.434 --> 47:01.984
we're impressed
with this new art.

47:01.986 --> 47:02.952
We'll be in touch.

47:04.422 --> 47:05.321
- Yeah.

47:10.595 --> 47:13.930
Red theme, sexy female voice.

47:14.599 --> 47:15.998
Highly understated.

47:18.303 --> 47:20.870
(dog barking)

47:22.473 --> 47:25.608
(game playing on TV)

47:30.915 --> 47:32.215
How's that?

47:32.217 --> 47:33.583
- That feels so good.

47:37.288 --> 47:38.187
- Yeah?

47:38.189 --> 47:39.088
- Mm-hmm.

47:44.929 --> 47:45.962
- How about this?

47:45.964 --> 47:46.596
Yeah?

47:46.598 --> 47:47.496
Right there.

47:50.401 --> 47:53.002
At least if we
ever lose our jobs,

47:54.339 --> 47:56.906
we could always fall back
on my massaging skills.

47:56.908 --> 47:57.940
(Gbemi laughs)

47:57.942 --> 47:59.442
Ow, hey!

47:59.444 --> 48:00.910
Don't break it!

48:04.249 --> 48:06.048
So, how's work?

48:07.485 --> 48:09.652
Anything interesting?

48:11.222 --> 48:12.521
- Work's fine.

48:13.625 --> 48:16.025
The school has been hiring
new teachers lately.

48:17.896 --> 48:20.329
One of them is this
really cute guy.

48:20.331 --> 48:21.931
I think I'm gonna ask him out.

48:24.068 --> 48:25.334
- Really?

48:25.336 --> 48:27.603
Yeah, okay, just gimme my ring.

48:27.605 --> 48:28.671
- No!

48:28.673 --> 48:29.672
- Just gimme my ring.

48:29.673 --> 48:30.672
- Not happening! (laughs)
- Gimme my ring!

48:30.675 --> 48:33.609
(Gbmei laughs)

48:33.611 --> 48:34.510
- Anyway.

48:35.580 --> 48:37.146
And then there's this lady.

48:37.148 --> 48:38.948
Her name is Cynthia.

48:38.950 --> 48:40.016
- Yeah, well, is she hot?

48:40.018 --> 48:41.684
Maybe I can ask Cynthia out?

48:41.686 --> 48:43.953
- Ha ha, very funny.

48:45.690 --> 48:47.223
And you see the way
the boys at school

48:47.225 --> 48:49.325
drool over her when
she walks by there.

48:49.327 --> 48:50.359
It's crazy.

48:51.930 --> 48:52.695
- Jealous much?

48:52.697 --> 48:53.930
- No joke.

48:53.932 --> 48:54.664
- Huh?

48:54.666 --> 48:57.633
- No, we're actually along.

49:02.674 --> 49:06.175
Oh, past 10.

49:06.177 --> 49:07.710
I am going to bed.

49:09.714 --> 49:13.015
- Hey, I was watching that!

49:13.017 --> 49:14.216
- Now you aren't.

49:14.218 --> 49:15.051
Come on.

49:15.053 --> 49:16.719
- Because?

49:16.721 --> 49:17.653
- [Gbemi] Let's go!

49:17.655 --> 49:21.090
(speaking in foreign language)

49:21.092 --> 49:24.093
- [Richard] Gonna
give me orders.

49:24.696 --> 49:28.965
- No. (laughs)

50:24.522 --> 50:27.790
(dramatic music)

50:27.792 --> 50:30.059
We need to call the florist.

50:30.061 --> 50:31.627
- [Richard] Hm?

50:31.629 --> 50:35.297
- The flowers, they're wilting.

50:35.299 --> 50:38.100
(dramatic music)

50:44.475 --> 50:48.444
- Hey, you think maybe
they can send you

50:48.446 --> 50:51.814
something other
than red hibiscus?

50:51.816 --> 50:53.249
- No.

50:53.251 --> 50:56.318
(dramatic music)

50:56.320 --> 50:58.054
- Gbemi, they don't
even have a scent.

50:58.056 --> 51:01.490
- Mm, you're a
florist now, are you?

51:01.492 --> 51:03.426
Anyway, if you hate it so much,

51:03.428 --> 51:06.062
why was there one under your
pillow during the night?

51:06.064 --> 51:08.664
(dramatic music)

51:09.734 --> 51:11.067
- I don't know.

51:11.836 --> 51:14.203
Maybe I like the smell.

51:17.208 --> 51:18.174
Or the lack of it.

51:20.411 --> 51:21.744
- You're weird.

51:22.847 --> 51:23.712
- And you love me.

51:23.714 --> 51:25.648
- (laughs) I do.

51:25.650 --> 51:26.482
- Yeah?

51:26.484 --> 51:27.583
You sure?

51:27.585 --> 51:30.119
You won't change your mind?

51:32.723 --> 51:34.523
I see how you're
giving me orders.

51:35.626 --> 51:37.326
Share my house about now.

51:37.328 --> 51:40.162
(Gbemi laughing)

51:41.666 --> 51:44.633
(Richard shouting)

51:56.848 --> 51:57.713
- Yo bro,

51:59.517 --> 52:04.386
met an insanely attractive
woman few weeks ago.

52:08.626 --> 52:11.527
- Yeah, you, that changes women

52:11.529 --> 52:13.796
the way they change
their hairdos.

52:13.798 --> 52:17.266
Tell me, what's so
special about this one?

52:17.268 --> 52:18.167
- I dunno.

52:24.742 --> 52:28.844
It's just that I think
she's the one, man.

52:28.846 --> 52:31.247
(Richard laughs)

52:31.249 --> 52:32.148
You know?

52:32.884 --> 52:33.782
- Yeah.

52:33.784 --> 52:36.685
- Look, I just think it's
time for me to settle down

52:36.687 --> 52:40.789
and just be a grown-up, and
be more like you, really.

52:40.791 --> 52:41.757
- [Richard] Yeah, joker.

52:41.759 --> 52:42.658
- Well done.

52:43.895 --> 52:45.327
I'm actually being serious.

52:49.267 --> 52:51.300
Look, I'm just trying
to open up to you, man.

52:54.805 --> 52:56.939
I think she just
suits me, you know?

53:03.814 --> 53:05.848
Actually, it's actually
more than that.

53:08.252 --> 53:09.485
I think I'm love with her.

53:09.487 --> 53:14.557
- (laughs) Dude, you
trying to kill me?

53:15.626 --> 53:18.861
(laughs) Did you
just use the L word?

53:18.863 --> 53:20.496
- Dude, I'm being serious, man.

53:23.234 --> 53:24.433
Yo.

53:24.435 --> 53:25.467
Pull a muscle or something?

53:25.469 --> 53:26.602
Why are you stopping?

53:28.439 --> 53:29.471
- What?

53:29.473 --> 53:30.873
I added a few kg's.

53:30.875 --> 53:32.374
It's taking some getting
used to, that's all.

53:32.376 --> 53:34.276
- A few kg's, man.

53:35.980 --> 53:37.313
Just being lazy.

53:37.315 --> 53:40.216
You lazy ass.

53:40.218 --> 53:40.849
- Really?

53:40.851 --> 53:44.353
Yeah, okay, tough guy.

53:45.323 --> 53:46.589
Gimme 10.

53:46.591 --> 53:47.423
- Let's see you do 10.

53:47.425 --> 53:48.424
- Gimme 10.

53:48.426 --> 53:49.692
- Only 10?
- Only 10.

53:49.694 --> 53:51.283
(Obaro sighs)

53:51.284 --> 53:52.873
- You're gonna have to put
your money where your mouth is.

53:52.874 --> 53:54.463
- Now you know there's
money here, come on.

53:54.465 --> 53:56.432
In fact, I'll spot you.

53:56.434 --> 53:59.335
- I don't need no
spot, I got this.

54:00.004 --> 54:01.337
Obaro's about to

54:01.339 --> 54:03.906
make some cash.
- I'll spot you anyway.

54:03.908 --> 54:05.241
- I don't need no spot.

54:05.243 --> 54:06.442
- Obaro.

54:06.444 --> 54:07.376
- I got this.

54:07.378 --> 54:08.777
I'll hold your wallet, too.

54:08.779 --> 54:09.612
- My wallet?

54:09.614 --> 54:10.913
- Well, your wallet.

54:10.915 --> 54:12.314
Let's get this.

54:12.316 --> 54:13.249
Let's make this money.

54:13.251 --> 54:13.882
- You need some help?

54:13.884 --> 54:14.717
You don't need no help?

54:14.719 --> 54:15.618
- I got.

54:16.520 --> 54:17.453
Cool down.

54:17.455 --> 54:18.320
(speaking in foreign language)

54:18.322 --> 54:20.489
- Go for it, all right.

54:20.491 --> 54:23.325
Okay, let's go, hey!

54:23.327 --> 54:25.728
Lightweight, baby.

54:26.931 --> 54:29.999
Flash cake, let's go, baby!

54:30.001 --> 54:32.868
Let's go!

54:32.870 --> 54:33.769
- [Obaro] Four.

54:35.473 --> 54:36.372
Five.

54:39.543 --> 54:40.609
Six.

54:40.611 --> 54:42.811
(dramatic music)

54:42.813 --> 54:43.712
Seven.

54:44.649 --> 54:46.382
- Keep it going.

54:46.384 --> 54:49.018
(dramatic music)

54:55.793 --> 54:58.360
- [Obaro] (grunts) Richard.

54:58.362 --> 54:59.628
Richard!

55:00.898 --> 55:01.730
- Sorry, I got you.

55:01.732 --> 55:04.400
(Obaro grunts)

55:04.402 --> 55:05.634
- [Obaro] Woo!

55:05.636 --> 55:08.437
All right, it's okay, you win.

55:08.439 --> 55:09.405
It's all right.

55:09.407 --> 55:11.840
(dramatic music)

55:11.842 --> 55:15.811
(speaking in foreign language)

55:24.922 --> 55:28.057
- [White Shirt] Dude,
watch we're you're going.

55:28.059 --> 55:28.891
- Sorry.

55:28.893 --> 55:31.727
(dramatic music)

55:33.698 --> 55:35.664
- [Obaro] No one
does so much walking.

55:36.701 --> 55:41.003
(speaking in foreign
language) Woo!

55:41.005 --> 55:41.904
What?

55:45.376 --> 55:48.010
(dramatic music)

55:52.350 --> 55:52.981
Hey, you okay?

55:52.983 --> 55:53.882
- Yeah.

55:58.956 --> 55:59.788
- [Obaro] You sure you're okay?

55:59.790 --> 56:00.656
- I'm fine.

56:02.059 --> 56:04.560
Listen, I've had enough, I
think I'm gonna head home.

56:04.562 --> 56:05.794
- Well, suit yourself.

56:05.796 --> 56:08.430
I'm gonna do some
more work here.

56:09.900 --> 56:12.768
- Okay, listen, I'm
happy for you, yeah?

56:12.770 --> 56:13.602
When am I gonna meet her?

56:13.604 --> 56:14.837
What's her name?

56:14.839 --> 56:17.473
- Hey, I beg, don't jinx
this thing for me, eh?

56:17.475 --> 56:19.541
Look, I'm in love, and I
don't wanna mess this up.

56:19.543 --> 56:20.376
No jinxing, please.

56:20.378 --> 56:21.410
- It's okay.

56:21.412 --> 56:22.144
- Yeah?

56:22.146 --> 56:24.013
- Don't use the L word again.

56:24.014 --> 56:25.881
Sounds like you just
discovered the word.

56:25.883 --> 56:27.933
- Look, you know there
are a lot of things here

56:27.934 --> 56:29.984
that I could hit you
with, and I'm tempted to.

56:29.987 --> 56:31.387
- Deal, peace.

56:31.389 --> 56:32.421
- Just go.

56:32.423 --> 56:33.689
- Bring her over sometime.

56:33.691 --> 56:34.957
- Just go.
- Can you bring her over

56:34.959 --> 56:36.959
sometime?
- Be going.

56:36.961 --> 56:37.793
(speaking in foreign language)

56:37.795 --> 56:39.561
Jinx master, geez.

56:49.407 --> 56:50.406
- [Gbemi] Hey, you.

56:51.742 --> 56:52.641
- Hey.

56:55.746 --> 56:56.979
- [Gbemi] Are you okay?

56:58.482 --> 57:01.750
- Yeah, just tired.

57:01.752 --> 57:02.718
It was a long day.

57:09.427 --> 57:11.794
- Looks like someone hit it
pretty hard at the gym, huh?

57:11.796 --> 57:14.696
- Oh, you can say that.

57:14.698 --> 57:17.132
Obaro says he's found someone

57:17.134 --> 57:18.934
that he wants to
settle down with.

57:21.439 --> 57:22.905
- [Gbemi] Obaro?

57:22.907 --> 57:23.806
- Yep.

57:24.875 --> 57:26.175
Obaro.

57:26.177 --> 57:28.076
- [Gbemi] (laughs)
That's interesting

57:30.614 --> 57:32.614
(dramatic music)

57:32.616 --> 57:34.516
- Come on, honeys.

57:34.518 --> 57:36.819
Say what you're really thinking.

57:36.821 --> 57:39.488
- [Gbemi] Oh babe, you know
that's really like you there.

57:39.490 --> 57:42.491
(dramatic music)

57:46.030 --> 57:47.663
- Yeah, well.

57:47.665 --> 57:50.232
- [Gbemi] (laughs) Obaro.

57:50.234 --> 57:51.567
Right.

57:51.569 --> 57:53.602
- He seemed pretty serious.

57:58.576 --> 58:00.709
- He should bring her over then.

58:00.711 --> 58:02.244
- Yeah, come on.

58:02.246 --> 58:04.546
I need some mama love.

58:07.518 --> 58:11.720
- Meanwhile, I have more
interesting news for you.

58:13.557 --> 58:14.490
- Go ahead, spill.

58:15.726 --> 58:18.727
- (sighs) Beg me.

58:18.729 --> 58:22.898
- Oh, come on, Gbemi, don't
let me do the begging thing.

58:22.900 --> 58:24.566
- Well.

58:24.568 --> 58:26.134
- Spill, tell me.

58:26.136 --> 58:29.071
- It looks like we have to
start thinking about baby names.

58:29.073 --> 58:33.175
(man shouting on TV)
(guns firing on TV)

58:33.177 --> 58:34.009
- Are you serious?

58:34.011 --> 58:36.712
- Mm-hmm. (laughs)

58:36.714 --> 58:37.713
- When?

58:37.715 --> 58:39.114
Are you serious?

58:41.619 --> 58:46.688
You so are! (laughs)

58:47.224 --> 58:47.623
- Hey, Daddy.

58:48.559 --> 58:49.992
- Oh, say it again.

58:51.028 --> 58:51.927
- Hey, Daddy.

58:53.297 --> 58:55.964
- Thank goodness, I'm
gonna be a father.

58:55.966 --> 58:56.798
- You are.

58:56.800 --> 58:58.867
- I'm gonna be a father.

59:04.642 --> 59:06.542
You shoulda seen him.

59:06.544 --> 59:08.043
It was just on and on and on.

59:08.045 --> 59:11.013
- So, you gonna tell me where
you're taking me this weekend?

59:11.015 --> 59:11.980
- Well.

59:11.982 --> 59:12.881
- Tell me!

59:12.883 --> 59:13.916
- To the moon.

59:13.918 --> 59:15.617
- Yeah?

59:15.619 --> 59:18.287
- Away to the moon.
(cell phone dings)

59:18.289 --> 59:19.621
- One second.

59:21.559 --> 59:23.725
Oh, it's my friend Cynthia.

59:23.727 --> 59:25.694
She's going to be a bit late.

59:25.696 --> 59:27.629
- Oh, really?

59:27.631 --> 59:28.597
That's good.

59:28.599 --> 59:31.066
(gentle music)

59:33.804 --> 59:36.171
- Am I interrupting something?

59:36.173 --> 59:37.072
- Hey!
- Yes.

59:38.108 --> 59:40.208
(Obaro laughs)

59:40.210 --> 59:42.144
Finally, man, you made it!

59:42.146 --> 59:43.111
- I did!

59:44.281 --> 59:45.681
My lady.

59:45.683 --> 59:46.582
- My lord.

59:48.586 --> 59:51.687
- I think you have
your lords mixed up.

59:52.957 --> 59:54.189
- [Obaro] Yes.

59:55.659 --> 59:58.360
- Where's our mystery lady at?

59:58.362 --> 01:00:01.730
- She's running late,
something came up last minute.

01:00:01.732 --> 01:00:03.332
Yeah, she'll be here soon.

01:00:03.334 --> 01:00:07.135
- Hmm, Obaro. (laughs)

01:00:07.137 --> 01:00:08.370
- Well.

01:00:08.372 --> 01:00:09.989
- I can't wait to
meet this woman

01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:11.607
that have managed
to tie you down.

01:00:11.609 --> 01:00:14.676
- No, telling you.
- She would be special.

01:00:14.678 --> 01:00:15.777
- She is.

01:00:16.347 --> 01:00:17.913
She's very special.

01:00:19.783 --> 01:00:23.352
I don't remember when
last I found someone

01:00:23.354 --> 01:00:24.753
that make me so happy.

01:00:24.755 --> 01:00:27.823
(Gbemi coos)

01:00:27.825 --> 01:00:29.391
- Sir, you sound
like a natural dork.

01:00:29.393 --> 01:00:31.393
- Richard!

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:33.394
- It's all right, still
proud of you, happy for you.

01:00:33.397 --> 01:00:34.696
- Thank you.

01:00:34.698 --> 01:00:37.132
(gentle music)

01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:38.367
- [Gbemi And Obaro]
There she is.

01:00:38.369 --> 01:00:39.768
- [Obaro] Huh?

01:00:43.941 --> 01:00:46.742
(dramatic music)

01:00:54.718 --> 01:00:57.085
- Cynthia's your girlfriend?

01:00:57.988 --> 01:00:58.854
- [Cynthia] Hey.

01:01:00.224 --> 01:01:02.658
- [Obaro] Darling,
you look stunning.

01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:04.793
Meet my very good friend, Gbemi.

01:01:04.795 --> 01:01:07.829
- Well, me and Gbemi are
like best friends already.

01:01:07.831 --> 01:01:09.831
- I see.

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:14.036
Just, well, meet my
best friend, Richard.

01:01:15.205 --> 01:01:17.172
- Hi, Richard.

01:01:17.174 --> 01:01:18.306
I've heard so much about you.

01:01:18.308 --> 01:01:20.442
Gbemi says wonderful things.

01:01:20.444 --> 01:01:23.445
(dramatic music)

01:01:24.448 --> 01:01:25.947
- Shake her hand.

01:01:25.949 --> 01:01:28.784
- Hi, it's nice to
meet you, Sylvia.

01:01:29.386 --> 01:01:31.319
- Babe, it's Cynthia.

01:01:31.321 --> 01:01:32.454
Cynthia.

01:01:32.456 --> 01:01:33.388
- Right.

01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:36.191
(dramatic music)

01:01:37.695 --> 01:01:39.394
- Okay, wait.

01:01:39.396 --> 01:01:40.295
Breathe.

01:01:41.999 --> 01:01:45.167
So, Obaro is the boyfriend
you've been going on about.

01:01:45.169 --> 01:01:47.836
- Yes, he is. (laughs)

01:01:48.439 --> 01:01:51.873
(dramatic music)

01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:52.841
- No, he's not.

01:01:54.011 --> 01:01:54.876
- What?

01:01:57.948 --> 01:01:59.748
- I don't understand.

01:02:00.818 --> 01:02:02.784
- I don't want to be
your boyfriend anymore.

01:02:04.221 --> 01:02:05.320
I mean, the word boyfriend alone

01:02:05.322 --> 01:02:07.422
just sounds kind of juvenile.

01:02:09.293 --> 01:02:12.494
I want much more.

01:02:14.498 --> 01:02:15.397
You're a keeper.

01:02:17.134 --> 01:02:19.501
You're kind, you're sweet,

01:02:19.503 --> 01:02:22.037
you're gentle,
and you're caring.

01:02:23.407 --> 01:02:27.776
I mean, you've shown me love
as I've never known it before.

01:02:28.912 --> 01:02:31.046
You're the kind of woman
that I've always dreamed of

01:02:31.048 --> 01:02:35.350
but always presumed
could not possibly exist.

01:02:36.854 --> 01:02:39.354
But here you are, real as ever.

01:02:41.425 --> 01:02:44.860
And I know this may be
coming a bit too soon,

01:02:45.996 --> 01:02:50.098
but I'll be damned if I
let my head talk me out

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:52.467
of what my heart already knows.

01:02:52.469 --> 01:02:54.436
(dramatic music)

01:02:54.438 --> 01:02:56.037
So, I'm asking, Cynthia.

01:02:57.141 --> 01:02:58.774
- Hey.

01:02:58.776 --> 01:03:01.476
(dramatic music)

01:03:03.013 --> 01:03:03.912
- Cynthia,

01:03:06.817 --> 01:03:11.887
will you accept to
wake up every morning

01:03:15.826 --> 01:03:16.842
next to this guy?

01:03:16.843 --> 01:03:17.859
Would you let me
love you, Cynthia?

01:03:19.196 --> 01:03:22.564
Would you let me be there for
you, through thick and thin?

01:03:22.566 --> 01:03:25.400
(dramatic music)

01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:28.103
Cynthia, will you marry me?

01:03:28.105 --> 01:03:30.572
(Cynthia sobs)

01:03:30.574 --> 01:03:33.441
(Gbemi laughs)

01:03:37.848 --> 01:03:39.281
She said yes, guys!

01:03:40.083 --> 01:03:41.283
She said yes!

01:03:41.285 --> 01:03:42.851
(crowd claps)

01:03:42.853 --> 01:03:44.486
Yes, woo!

01:03:46.557 --> 01:03:47.989
- Wow, oh my gosh,

01:03:47.991 --> 01:03:49.891
I'm so glad I got
to witness this.

01:03:49.893 --> 01:03:52.260
You guys are going to
have the cutest babies.

01:03:52.262 --> 01:03:54.563
- I feel like I'm the
luckiest girl in the world.

01:03:54.565 --> 01:03:56.097
- [Gbemi] Hey, me too.

01:03:57.367 --> 01:03:58.233
- Indeed!

01:03:59.837 --> 01:04:00.902
And so are you.

01:04:00.904 --> 01:04:03.939
(dramatic music)

01:04:04.608 --> 01:04:05.974
- Are you okay, bro?

01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:08.009
- Yeah.

01:04:08.879 --> 01:04:10.011
Yeah, memories.

01:04:11.915 --> 01:04:13.849
Love is a beautiful thing.

01:04:15.285 --> 01:04:16.184
- I know!

01:04:18.622 --> 01:04:21.523
Obaro. (laughs)

01:04:21.525 --> 01:04:24.259
(dramatic music)

01:04:24.261 --> 01:04:27.629
- Do you really know
what you're doing?

01:04:27.631 --> 01:04:30.532
- I know exactly what I'm doing.

01:04:30.534 --> 01:04:31.967
- [Waiter] Congratulations.

01:04:31.969 --> 01:04:33.635
This one's on the house.

01:04:33.637 --> 01:04:35.070
- Awesome!

01:04:35.072 --> 01:04:36.638
You know what?

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:39.875
We're gonna need more
of this tonight, okay?

01:04:39.877 --> 01:04:42.444
- And bring me something
stronger, like a whiskey.

01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:47.449
- No, I'm okay.

01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:48.649
- Gbemi, you're not gonna
drink on a day like this?

01:04:48.652 --> 01:04:52.220
- Well, I'm this one's
designated driver.

01:04:54.291 --> 01:04:57.158
Also, we're pregnant!

01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:00.629
- What?

01:05:00.631 --> 01:05:03.465
(laughs) Well, congratulations!

01:05:03.467 --> 01:05:04.366
Really?

01:05:06.003 --> 01:05:08.403
Well, congratulations,
why didn't you tell me?

01:05:10.107 --> 01:05:12.007
Congratulations!

01:05:12.009 --> 01:05:12.908
What?

01:05:13.944 --> 01:05:15.043
- Thank you.
- You know what,

01:05:15.045 --> 01:05:16.678
we need food as well.

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:19.381
We need like seafood
platters, pizza,

01:05:19.383 --> 01:05:21.683
we need everything
here, to eat, to feast.

01:05:21.685 --> 01:05:25.453
- [Cynthia] Oh,
baby, do you love me?

01:05:25.455 --> 01:05:26.922
- Oh, you spoil me.

01:05:26.924 --> 01:05:29.557
(dramatic music)

01:05:45.208 --> 01:05:47.242
(dramatic music)

01:05:47.244 --> 01:05:50.011
(phone rings)

01:05:57.254 --> 01:05:59.054
- Good morning, sir.

01:05:59.056 --> 01:06:00.021
You're late today.

01:06:01.158 --> 01:06:03.491
I hope all is well
at casa del amor.

01:06:05.996 --> 01:06:07.362
- Good morning, Hawa.

01:06:07.364 --> 01:06:09.197
- Okay, you're grumpy.

01:06:11.034 --> 01:06:12.701
- No, I just had a
lot of work to do.

01:06:12.703 --> 01:06:14.569
- Oh yes, you do,
have you heard?

01:06:14.571 --> 01:06:17.372
You have been managing
their contract with us,

01:06:17.374 --> 01:06:18.573
and they're requesting a thing

01:06:18.575 --> 01:06:20.675
to move their company
to a better light.

01:06:20.677 --> 01:06:22.243
We did it!

01:06:22.245 --> 01:06:23.144
Yes!

01:06:25.115 --> 01:06:26.014
Okay.

01:06:29.553 --> 01:06:31.486
Are you okay, sir?

01:06:31.488 --> 01:06:33.021
You okay?

01:06:33.023 --> 01:06:34.022
- Boundaries, Hawa.

01:06:34.725 --> 01:06:36.091
- Oh, sorry.

01:06:37.027 --> 01:06:38.193
- Boundaries.

01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:44.065
- I'll just make your coffee
and print your schedule.

01:06:44.601 --> 01:06:47.135
(dramatic music)

01:07:12.329 --> 01:07:15.497
(cell phone ringing)

01:07:59.076 --> 01:08:01.509
- [Cynthia] This
is a lot, Gbemi.

01:08:01.511 --> 01:08:03.211
- [Gbemi] I know!

01:08:04.247 --> 01:08:06.381
Hey, you know what?

01:08:06.383 --> 01:08:08.183
It's Friday.

01:08:08.185 --> 01:08:10.485
How about you stay the weekend?

01:08:10.487 --> 01:08:13.188
That would have me no
time to go to the store.

01:08:14.191 --> 01:08:15.090
Please.

01:08:19.328 --> 01:08:20.728
I sorry, please.

01:08:22.198 --> 01:08:23.865
- [Cynthia] This
dress is so fine.

01:08:23.867 --> 01:08:25.533
- [Gbemi] I know, it's so you.

01:08:27.104 --> 01:08:28.819
- [Cynthia] I love this color.

01:08:28.821 --> 01:08:30.537
But I don't know if
those patterns will work.

01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:31.372
- Yeah?

01:08:31.374 --> 01:08:32.273
Hold on.

01:08:32.876 --> 01:08:35.609
Look at this one.

01:08:35.612 --> 01:08:38.145
Hold on, look at this.

01:08:38.148 --> 01:08:40.281
This back from here.

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:42.183
- [Cynthia] This is so nice.

01:08:42.185 --> 01:08:44.319
- Because it's purple.

01:08:44.321 --> 01:08:47.654
(Richard coughs)

01:08:47.657 --> 01:08:49.189
Hey, baby.

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:54.395
(dramatic music)

01:08:59.736 --> 01:09:00.902
How was work?

01:09:00.904 --> 01:09:02.537
- Good.

01:09:02.538 --> 01:09:05.773
Good, I wish I could've
finished those earlier.

01:09:07.210 --> 01:09:08.243
You okay?

01:09:08.245 --> 01:09:09.144
- Very.

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:15.250
Oh, by the way, babe, I
invited Cynthia to stay over.

01:09:15.252 --> 01:09:16.684
I'm helping with wedding plans.

01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:19.354
- Sure, I see.

01:09:20.423 --> 01:09:21.923
- I hope you don't
mind, Richard,

01:09:21.925 --> 01:09:26.493
but your wife has a great
sense of aesthetics.

01:09:26.496 --> 01:09:27.795
I mean, these flowers.

01:09:28.732 --> 01:09:30.899
Red hibiscuses are my favorite.

01:09:32.602 --> 01:09:34.801
- My husband hates them
all for some reason.

01:09:34.804 --> 01:09:36.837
- Oh, but I love them.

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:37.738
- Thank you.

01:09:39.408 --> 01:09:41.910
- Did you know that
the red hibiscus

01:09:41.912 --> 01:09:44.546
is the flower of the
Hindu goddess Kali?

01:09:46.349 --> 01:09:49.184
- And she's the goddess
of what exactly?

01:09:50.787 --> 01:09:55.190
- Well, some say sexuality,

01:09:57.394 --> 01:09:59.494
violence, and motherly love.

01:10:02.933 --> 01:10:08.203
But she's more known as
the destroyer of unreality.

01:10:10.273 --> 01:10:11.439
- So, she's a destroyer?

01:10:13.243 --> 01:10:16.744
Isn't that enough reason for
us to just get rid of them now?

01:10:16.746 --> 01:10:21.816
- Oh baby, I did not marry a
superstitious man, now did I?

01:10:22.352 --> 01:10:24.652
(oven beeps)

01:10:24.654 --> 01:10:27.422
Ooh, chicken's done.

01:10:27.424 --> 01:10:29.524
I will be right back.

01:10:30.827 --> 01:10:33.628
(dramatic music)

01:10:35.932 --> 01:10:37.665
- I'm just gonna--

01:10:37.667 --> 01:10:38.800
- Hi, Richard.

01:10:40.003 --> 01:10:43.238
- So, I'm staying the weekend.

01:10:44.507 --> 01:10:47.408
Imagine how much more
fun we could have.

01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:51.779
- Listen to me.

01:10:51.781 --> 01:10:53.014
- I'm listening.

01:10:53.016 --> 01:10:54.549
- The last time,
it was an accident.

01:10:55.518 --> 01:10:58.319
It was an accident.

01:10:58.321 --> 01:11:00.321
- Really, an accident?

01:11:00.323 --> 01:11:01.956
You're getting clumsy, Richie.

01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:04.792
- Listen to me.

01:11:04.794 --> 01:11:06.327
- I'm listening.

01:11:06.329 --> 01:11:07.929
- It was a mistake.

01:11:07.931 --> 01:11:11.466
It cannot, it will
not happen again,

01:11:11.468 --> 01:11:13.735
do you understand me, Sylvia?

01:11:13.737 --> 01:11:16.037
I am trying to build
a life with my family.

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:18.706
- Oh, honey.

01:11:19.643 --> 01:11:20.575
How poetic.

01:11:21.945 --> 01:11:26.447
The only mistake here
is your wife, not me.

01:11:28.652 --> 01:11:30.985
- If my wife comes in
right now, what am I gonna?

01:11:30.987 --> 01:11:33.821
(dramatic music)

01:11:36.059 --> 01:11:37.392
- What's going on here?

01:11:37.394 --> 01:11:39.727
- Your husband is so clumsy,

01:11:39.729 --> 01:11:40.995
so he was pretending
to show me how

01:11:40.997 --> 01:11:43.298
he's going to hold the new baby.

01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:44.832
He failed miserably.

01:11:46.303 --> 01:11:48.069
- We're not doing work.

01:11:48.071 --> 01:11:50.938
Come Cynthia, come help
me with the food, eh?

01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:52.006
- Okay.

01:11:52.008 --> 01:11:54.809
(dramatic music)

01:12:11.761 --> 01:12:14.462
(door slams)

01:12:16.566 --> 01:12:17.665
- We need to talk.

01:12:20.603 --> 01:12:23.705
Sit down.

01:12:28.912 --> 01:12:29.811
- Okay.

01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:35.516
- I don't like her.

01:12:35.518 --> 01:12:36.984
I don't like her.

01:12:38.421 --> 01:12:41.356
She gives me bad vibes,
I do not like her,

01:12:41.358 --> 01:12:43.991
and I will not
have you with her.

01:12:43.993 --> 01:12:47.128
- All Cynthia has done
is be a good friend.

01:12:47.130 --> 01:12:48.963
I'm sorry, I can't
just send her outside

01:12:48.965 --> 01:12:51.432
simply because she
gives you bad vibes.

01:12:54.037 --> 01:12:55.570
- Who's the man in this house?

01:12:56.573 --> 01:12:58.706
It's still my house, right?

01:12:58.708 --> 01:13:01.409
No, last time I checked,
it's still my house, right?

01:13:01.411 --> 01:13:04.379
Did you ask me before
inviting her into this place?

01:13:05.515 --> 01:13:06.948
And then asking her
to spend the night.

01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:07.949
Did you ask me?

01:13:12.489 --> 01:13:13.388
No, you never listen!

01:13:14.624 --> 01:13:16.124
You never listen, Gbemi.

01:13:16.126 --> 01:13:18.993
At first, I asked you to get
rid of those bloody hibiscus.

01:13:18.995 --> 01:13:19.894
Did you?

01:13:20.930 --> 01:13:22.630
You refuse.

01:13:22.632 --> 01:13:24.665
Now I'm asking you
to get rid of--

01:13:24.667 --> 01:13:27.602
- First of all, do not
raise your voice at me.

01:13:28.772 --> 01:13:31.606
(Richard grunts)

01:13:33.042 --> 01:13:34.442
Is that good?

01:13:34.444 --> 01:13:35.143
Why?

01:13:36.413 --> 01:13:38.546
Why don't you want
her here, Richard?

01:13:40.150 --> 01:13:41.449
Tell me the truth.

01:13:53.163 --> 01:13:54.429
Wait.

01:14:00.503 --> 01:14:01.803
Are you attracted to her?

01:14:02.806 --> 01:14:04.105
Is that it?

01:14:05.208 --> 01:14:06.441
You're into her?

01:14:06.443 --> 01:14:07.141
- No!

01:14:08.178 --> 01:14:09.644
Gbemi, of course not!

01:14:12.449 --> 01:14:13.614
I love you!

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.587
I love you, I chose you.

01:14:21.157 --> 01:14:23.791
I love you.

01:14:25.528 --> 01:14:27.895
You are my wife, Gbemi.

01:14:28.765 --> 01:14:31.132
You are my wife, I chose you.

01:14:32.235 --> 01:14:36.170
Just get rid of her, get
rid of her right now.

01:14:36.172 --> 01:14:37.872
Right now, you
don't listen to me,

01:14:37.874 --> 01:14:40.241
I'm your husband, listen to me.

01:14:40.243 --> 01:14:43.544
- You need to check your
kindness, sweetheart.

01:14:43.546 --> 01:14:45.480
We are not in the
medieval times,

01:14:45.482 --> 01:14:46.581
you don't get to boss me around.

01:14:46.583 --> 01:14:49.050
- I'm not bossing you around!

01:14:51.688 --> 01:14:53.921
I'll try this differently.

01:14:57.260 --> 01:14:59.494
Can you please get
her out of my house?

01:15:00.230 --> 01:15:01.729
Right now.

01:15:01.731 --> 01:15:03.498
- Richard, don't patronize me!

01:15:04.734 --> 01:15:06.701
- You don't understand.

01:15:12.208 --> 01:15:14.942
- You know I am
reasonable person.

01:15:16.813 --> 01:15:20.515
Just gimme a good reason
why she shouldn't be here.

01:15:28.892 --> 01:15:31.192
(car horn honks)

01:15:31.194 --> 01:15:34.762
- I just don't like
her, I don't like her.

01:15:40.670 --> 01:15:42.036
- I'm going to bed.

01:15:43.306 --> 01:15:46.240
(feet pounding)

01:15:59.789 --> 01:16:01.055
She will leave tomorrow.

01:16:08.631 --> 01:16:11.632
- First, a guarantee.

01:16:13.603 --> 01:16:16.337
My team and I have put
together a campaign

01:16:16.339 --> 01:16:19.774
that will place the UFBN

01:16:19.776 --> 01:16:23.811
in a position that is
indeed rightfully yours.

01:16:24.814 --> 01:16:27.982
The leading food
company here in Nigeria.

01:16:29.352 --> 01:16:33.154
If you endorse this deal, and
of course, let's not forget

01:16:33.156 --> 01:16:35.590
we're talking
specifically in the minds

01:16:35.592 --> 01:16:37.725
of your target audience.

01:16:37.727 --> 01:16:39.827
If you endorse this deal,

01:16:39.829 --> 01:16:44.599
we will be successfully
creating an awareness

01:16:44.601 --> 01:16:49.670
on the lesser known UFBN
brands and products,

01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:53.941
which means, ladies
and gentlemen, (laughs)

01:16:53.943 --> 01:16:58.379
a rise in sales, and the
UFBN will have a more robust

01:16:58.381 --> 01:17:03.718
and fatter (laughs) bottom line.

01:17:04.621 --> 01:17:06.387
- That sounds very good.

01:17:06.389 --> 01:17:08.155
What we want to know is,

01:17:08.157 --> 01:17:11.192
how exactly does
No Box Incorporated

01:17:11.194 --> 01:17:12.760
plan on making this happen?

01:17:12.762 --> 01:17:14.228
- (laughs) Fair enough.

01:17:15.698 --> 01:17:16.731
Hawa.

01:17:16.733 --> 01:17:17.398
- Sir?

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:20.234
(dramatic music)

01:17:26.743 --> 01:17:29.310
- The folders, if you would.

01:17:29.312 --> 01:17:32.146
(dramatic music)

01:17:53.770 --> 01:17:56.270
According to our research,

01:17:56.272 --> 01:17:57.371
we found out that

01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:05.146
more Nigerians are finding
out about processed food.

01:18:05.148 --> 01:18:10.217
They're a lot more
aware and cautious

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:14.989
about cautious foods,
and being cautious.

01:18:14.991 --> 01:18:17.792
- Do you mean processed food?

01:18:17.794 --> 01:18:20.227
- Right. (laughs)

01:18:20.229 --> 01:18:21.996
Mrs. Iweta again.

01:18:21.998 --> 01:18:24.198
Processed, right.

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:24.999
Hawa?

01:18:25.001 --> 01:18:25.900
- Yes sir?

01:18:26.969 --> 01:18:28.035
- Nevermind.

01:18:28.037 --> 01:18:30.037
Mr. Davies, just worried,

01:18:30.039 --> 01:18:32.973
did you receive the
documents and files

01:18:32.975 --> 01:18:34.275
that I asked Hawa to email you?

01:18:34.277 --> 01:18:37.378
- No, she did not
send me any documents.

01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:42.049
- So, you did not
receive documents

01:18:42.051 --> 01:18:44.251
from this Hawa?

01:18:44.253 --> 01:18:46.987
- No, she didn't
send me any folders.

01:18:48.758 --> 01:18:49.490
- Right.

01:18:49.492 --> 01:18:52.493
(dramatic music)

01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:55.496
Let me carry on.

01:18:55.498 --> 01:18:56.864
As I was saying, therefore,

01:18:56.866 --> 01:18:58.733
to combat these...

01:19:02.271 --> 01:19:07.341
fearful opinions of potential
UFBN consumers, we will--

01:19:08.811 --> 01:19:11.011
- It's getting a
little difficult to
concentrate, isn't it?

01:19:11.914 --> 01:19:16.016
- We, the site is...

01:19:19.756 --> 01:19:23.424
We have outlined the,

01:19:24.794 --> 01:19:27.862
we have outlined everything,
and we're thinking rebranding.

01:19:28.898 --> 01:19:29.964
- Richie, Richie.

01:19:34.537 --> 01:19:38.806
I will not

01:19:38.808 --> 01:19:40.040
be ignored.

01:19:41.978 --> 01:19:45.112
- Gentlemen, I mean, yes.

01:19:45.114 --> 01:19:47.815
Well, what I was
trying to say is,

01:19:47.817 --> 01:19:49.850
we will take advantage
of the public's fear

01:19:49.852 --> 01:19:52.019
and use that to our advantage,

01:19:52.021 --> 01:19:56.056
increasing awareness
on safety standards

01:19:56.058 --> 01:19:59.894
that we use for our
processed foods.

01:20:09.939 --> 01:20:12.873
- Yes, come here,
Richie, let me kiss

01:20:12.875 --> 01:20:14.909
that smart mouth of yours.

01:20:18.147 --> 01:20:19.847
- [Mr. Davies] Richard?

01:20:19.849 --> 01:20:23.450
(Richard panting)

01:20:23.452 --> 01:20:26.520
(Richard screaming)

01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:33.561
- Leave me alone!

01:20:33.563 --> 01:20:36.430
(hand slaps)

01:20:36.432 --> 01:20:39.533
I don't wanna talk to you!

01:20:39.535 --> 01:20:41.836
You're trying to ruin me!

01:20:42.471 --> 01:20:44.138
- What's going on?

01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:45.005
What did you do?

01:20:48.377 --> 01:20:52.513
- What did I do?

01:20:52.515 --> 01:20:54.048
- [Mr. Davies] What is going on?

01:21:01.858 --> 01:21:02.556
Richard!

01:21:20.977 --> 01:21:22.109
- Well, that was awkward.

01:21:25.982 --> 01:21:26.881
- You.

01:21:27.984 --> 01:21:28.883
- Miss me?

01:21:29.952 --> 01:21:33.053
(Richard panting)

01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:39.526
- Sylvia, you win, okay?

01:21:39.528 --> 01:21:40.961
You win.

01:21:40.963 --> 01:21:42.029
I'm sorry.

01:21:42.899 --> 01:21:44.365
I'm so sorry that I doubted you,

01:21:44.367 --> 01:21:47.201
I'm so sorry that I
said you're not real.

01:21:47.203 --> 01:21:48.969
I should've listened to you.

01:21:50.039 --> 01:21:50.905
Please.

01:21:52.675 --> 01:21:56.310
- It's a little too
late for that, sugar.

01:21:57.647 --> 01:21:59.146
I've set my course,

01:22:00.917 --> 01:22:05.986
and you, Richie, are going down.

01:22:07.089 --> 01:22:09.556
(Richard grunting)
(bones cracking)

01:22:09.558 --> 01:22:12.326
(Sylvia laughs)

01:22:12.328 --> 01:22:15.229
(Richard panting)

01:22:16.065 --> 01:22:18.599
(Sylvia laughs)

01:22:18.601 --> 01:22:21.502
(dramatic music)

01:22:23.439 --> 01:22:25.439
- Please.

01:22:27.243 --> 01:22:29.977
- You betrayed me, Richard.

01:22:29.979 --> 01:22:32.980
(dramatic music)

01:22:33.950 --> 01:22:35.983
You betrayed us.

01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:40.220
And all that we had.

01:22:42.591 --> 01:22:44.725
And then you had the balls

01:22:44.727 --> 01:22:49.997
to return and ask me to
help you, use me over again.

01:22:55.137 --> 01:22:58.138
Revenge is like an
art form, Richard.

01:23:00.242 --> 01:23:04.044
You are my canvas,

01:23:05.081 --> 01:23:09.550
and I am like
Picasso on steroids.

01:23:10.419 --> 01:23:12.553
- Please, Sylvia, please!

01:23:12.555 --> 01:23:15.356
Please!
(cell phone rings)

01:23:15.358 --> 01:23:17.024
- I think you better get that.

01:23:18.094 --> 01:23:20.094
It's your booboo calling.

01:23:22.231 --> 01:23:24.098
I wonder what she's doing today.

01:23:25.768 --> 01:23:29.069
Ah, yes, that's right.

01:23:29.772 --> 01:23:31.538
She took a day off work,

01:23:33.642 --> 01:23:38.612
which means that Sylvia
can kick things up a notch.

01:23:39.749 --> 01:23:42.383
- Sylvia, you wouldn't dare!

01:23:44.086 --> 01:23:44.718
Sylvia!

01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:48.055
(cell phone ringing)

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:54.128
Gbemi, baby, are you okay?

01:23:54.130 --> 01:23:55.262
- Of course I am, darling.

01:23:55.264 --> 01:23:56.463
Why wouldn't I be?

01:23:56.465 --> 01:23:58.799
- I need you to go
somewhere, okay, baby?

01:23:58.801 --> 01:24:00.501
Anywhere that's crowded.

01:24:00.503 --> 01:24:03.137
- Richard, what's going on?

01:24:05.141 --> 01:24:08.409
- Gbemi, just
listen to me, okay?

01:24:08.411 --> 01:24:12.413
I'll see you soon, and
I'll explain everything.

01:24:14.250 --> 01:24:15.082
I'll tell you everything,

01:24:15.084 --> 01:24:17.651
just go to a movie

01:24:17.653 --> 01:24:19.420
or somewhere where there
are a lot of people,

01:24:19.422 --> 01:24:21.455
okay, so I know you're safe.

01:24:21.457 --> 01:24:22.356
- Safe?

01:24:23.359 --> 01:24:24.258
From what?

01:24:25.094 --> 01:24:28.295
- Gbemi, please, I can't.

01:24:28.297 --> 01:24:31.165
- If it makes you feel
any better, I'm not alone.

01:24:31.167 --> 01:24:33.333
Cynthia's here with me.

01:24:33.335 --> 01:24:36.270
Cynthia, please tell my
husband he's being weird.

01:24:38.174 --> 01:24:39.706
- You're being weird, Richard.

01:24:40.776 --> 01:24:45.079
Your wife and baby
are just fine.

01:24:46.115 --> 01:24:47.414
Don't you worry.

01:24:47.416 --> 01:24:50.150
I'll take good
care of them, okay?

01:24:52.822 --> 01:24:57.191
- Sylvia, I swear to
you, if you hurt her.

01:24:57.193 --> 01:25:01.128
- Aw, Gbemi, he says
he loves you to pieces.

01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:05.532
- You see?

01:25:05.534 --> 01:25:07.134
All's good here.

01:25:07.136 --> 01:25:10.504
- Gbemi, she's not, I'm
coming home right now.

01:25:10.506 --> 01:25:11.839
- Okay.

01:25:11.841 --> 01:25:12.873
- Gbemi.

01:25:12.875 --> 01:25:15.642
(phone beeps)

01:25:16.579 --> 01:25:17.511
I love you.

01:25:21.517 --> 01:25:22.416
I'm so sorry.

01:25:25.554 --> 01:25:26.720
I'm so sorry.

01:25:28.757 --> 01:25:31.258
(sniffles)

01:25:33.262 --> 01:25:36.130
- Richard, you hit your PA!

01:25:36.132 --> 01:25:37.898
You're having a
conversation with yourself?

01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:39.333
What is going on?

01:25:40.336 --> 01:25:41.902
I recommend you start talking

01:25:41.904 --> 01:25:44.404
before I turn this matter
over to the police.

01:25:44.406 --> 01:25:46.206
You assaulted a staff!

01:25:46.208 --> 01:25:47.641
You humiliated this company!

01:25:47.643 --> 01:25:50.310
- Sir, I don't have
time to explain.

01:25:50.312 --> 01:25:52.679
My wife is in danger,
she doesn't know it yet.

01:25:52.681 --> 01:25:53.847
I really have to go.

01:25:56.352 --> 01:25:57.251
Hawa?

01:25:59.622 --> 01:26:01.188
I'm terribly sorry.

01:26:01.190 --> 01:26:02.789
- You know there
will be consequences.

01:26:02.791 --> 01:26:05.792
- You are not listening to me.

01:26:05.794 --> 01:26:08.262
She's gonna kill her, okay?

01:26:08.898 --> 01:26:10.764
- Are you out of your mind?

01:26:10.766 --> 01:26:12.900
Who's gonna kill who, and why?

01:26:12.902 --> 01:26:15.302
- I have to go, so sorry.

01:26:15.304 --> 01:26:16.236
- Richard!

01:26:16.238 --> 01:26:19.173
(footsteps pounding)

01:26:19.175 --> 01:26:20.607
- She started kicking already.

01:26:20.609 --> 01:26:21.408
- Really?

01:26:21.410 --> 01:26:23.177
Lemme feel.

01:26:23.179 --> 01:26:23.944
Oh, wow!

01:26:24.947 --> 01:26:26.780
It's so beautiful.

01:26:26.782 --> 01:26:28.215
- It's amazing.

01:26:28.217 --> 01:26:31.251
(dramatic music)

01:26:46.902 --> 01:26:47.801
Babe?

01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:51.939
Babe?

01:26:51.941 --> 01:26:54.775
(dramatic music)

01:27:00.950 --> 01:27:01.848
- Gbemi...

01:27:03.986 --> 01:27:04.985
could you come over
here for a second?

01:27:04.987 --> 01:27:07.221
I just really wanna talk to you.

01:27:10.559 --> 01:27:12.259
- Are you okay?

01:27:12.261 --> 01:27:13.994
- Come on baby, this is
not one of those times

01:27:13.996 --> 01:27:14.928
to argue with me.

01:27:15.931 --> 01:27:17.464
It's not safe.

01:27:19.268 --> 01:27:23.570
That woman with you,
she's not Cynthia.

01:27:23.572 --> 01:27:24.905
Her name is Sylvia.

01:27:24.907 --> 01:27:27.674
(dramatic music)

01:27:27.676 --> 01:27:29.443
And she's the most
powerful being.

01:27:32.881 --> 01:27:34.881
Gbemi, please just
listen to me, please.

01:27:34.883 --> 01:27:36.883
- No, this isn't
making any sense.

01:27:36.885 --> 01:27:39.786
- I know, just trust me.

01:27:41.523 --> 01:27:43.757
- Babe, I'm starting
to really worry--

01:27:43.759 --> 01:27:45.325
- [Richard] Gbemi!

01:27:46.962 --> 01:27:47.861
Gbemi?

01:27:49.365 --> 01:27:51.798
(Sylvia growls)

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:53.500
- Calm down.

01:27:53.502 --> 01:27:54.601
Don't try to get up.

01:27:55.671 --> 01:27:58.005
Sit back, relax.

01:27:58.007 --> 01:28:01.375
You won't want to fall on
your face, now, do you?

01:28:01.377 --> 01:28:04.011
- [Richard] What did you do?

01:28:06.382 --> 01:28:08.515
- I did something with tea.

01:28:11.387 --> 01:28:15.956
I laced her tea with
something extra special.

01:28:19.662 --> 01:28:21.061
- You drugged my wife?

01:28:21.063 --> 01:28:22.796
- Relax, Richard.

01:28:23.832 --> 01:28:25.832
At least it's not lethal,

01:28:25.834 --> 01:28:27.968
like the herbs you
gave your mother.

01:28:27.970 --> 01:28:30.804
(dramatic music)

01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:44.651
- You told me those
herbs will heal her.

01:28:45.821 --> 01:28:46.687
- I lied.

01:28:47.923 --> 01:28:50.057
Surprise!

01:28:52.094 --> 01:28:53.860
- What did she ever do to you?

01:28:55.364 --> 01:28:56.830
- Think, Richard.

01:28:57.900 --> 01:28:59.533
She was just another woman

01:28:59.535 --> 01:29:01.668
who had too much
influence on you,

01:29:02.571 --> 01:29:05.005
and I don't like to share.

01:29:08.077 --> 01:29:10.811
(ring clatters)

01:29:12.648 --> 01:29:15.482
(Richard sobs)

01:29:18.387 --> 01:29:19.086
- Gbemi.

01:29:21.390 --> 01:29:26.460
Gbemi.

01:29:27.463 --> 01:29:30.130
- Richard.
- I'm so sorry, baby.

01:29:30.933 --> 01:29:31.832
- Quiet!

01:29:33.635 --> 01:29:38.705
Mommy and Daddy are having
a conversation, okay?

01:29:39.375 --> 01:29:41.441
So don't interrupt.

01:29:41.443 --> 01:29:45.879
So, I'm real, I exist,

01:29:45.881 --> 01:29:49.449
and I think I've
proven that clearly,

01:29:49.451 --> 01:29:52.386
so how about

01:29:54.123 --> 01:29:56.390
we just get together forever?

01:29:58.994 --> 01:30:00.060
Hm?

01:30:00.062 --> 01:30:02.896
(dramatic music)

01:30:07.136 --> 01:30:11.037
Richard, I'm not
going to say it again.

01:30:12.808 --> 01:30:14.174
Be with me,

01:30:16.512 --> 01:30:17.677
now or never.

01:30:26.155 --> 01:30:28.455
- [Richard] This has
got to stop, Sylvia.

01:30:30.526 --> 01:30:32.025
- You're trying to kill me?

01:30:34.596 --> 01:30:35.729
With a knife?

01:30:37.633 --> 01:30:39.766
(laughs)

01:30:41.537 --> 01:30:43.036
- It's worth a shot.

01:30:44.473 --> 01:30:46.873
(Sylvia gasps)

01:30:49.545 --> 01:30:50.610
- Oops!

01:30:56.552 --> 01:30:57.217
- Gbemi!

01:31:01.723 --> 01:31:04.991
(Richard sobs)

01:31:04.993 --> 01:31:09.496
Gbemi, no!

01:31:10.966 --> 01:31:13.633
(Richard sobs)

01:31:14.736 --> 01:31:17.971
- Stupid, stupid.

01:31:20.175 --> 01:31:24.978
Richard Okezie,
advertising superstar,

01:31:26.849 --> 01:31:28.715
kills his lovely wife.

01:31:32.254 --> 01:31:34.621
For shame, Richard.

01:31:36.158 --> 01:31:37.524
For shame!

01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:39.926
(knock on door)

01:31:39.928 --> 01:31:41.995
(dramatic music)

01:31:41.997 --> 01:31:42.896
Right on cue.

01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:47.234
(Sylvia screams)

01:31:48.504 --> 01:31:50.904
I told you he'd gone
crazy, I told you!

01:31:52.107 --> 01:31:54.908
(dramatic music)

01:32:03.552 --> 01:32:04.251
- Obaro.

01:32:06.255 --> 01:32:07.854
I didn't do this to her.

01:32:07.856 --> 01:32:10.690
- Yes you did, I saw you!

01:32:10.692 --> 01:32:14.928
- Shut up!

01:32:16.798 --> 01:32:20.867
Obaro,

01:32:22.037 --> 01:32:22.936
you know me.

01:32:24.706 --> 01:32:26.773
Obaro, you know how
much I love my wife.

01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:30.877
Obaro, you know I
wouldn't do this.

01:32:30.879 --> 01:32:32.546
- Richard?

01:32:32.548 --> 01:32:33.880
What happened?

01:32:33.882 --> 01:32:36.950
- It was she!

01:32:38.687 --> 01:32:40.587
She was standing in
front of my wife,

01:32:40.589 --> 01:32:42.722
and I was trying to kill her!

01:32:45.961 --> 01:32:48.795
One second, poof, she was gone!

01:32:48.797 --> 01:32:52.632
And then, I didn't
mean to kill my Gbemi!

01:32:54.770 --> 01:32:56.002
I was trying to kill Sylvia!

01:32:56.004 --> 01:32:57.804
- Who the hell is Sylvia?

01:32:57.806 --> 01:33:00.173
- That is Sylvia.

01:33:00.175 --> 01:33:01.575
That's Sylvia behind you.

01:33:02.844 --> 01:33:06.046
The same witch you're
getting married to.

01:33:07.649 --> 01:33:12.185
Obaro, I've been seeing her
in my dreams my whole life.

01:33:14.022 --> 01:33:14.921
- Dreams?

01:33:16.858 --> 01:33:19.025
- I'm telling you,
all this time.

01:33:19.027 --> 01:33:20.360
And then you know what?

01:33:20.362 --> 01:33:23.997
She got jealous
when I met my Gbemi.

01:33:23.999 --> 01:33:28.768
She got jealous when I met
my Gbemi, so she's ruined me!

01:33:29.671 --> 01:33:30.870
- Richard, you're not
making sense right now.

01:33:30.872 --> 01:33:33.073
- [Richard] Oh, she's
trying to ruin me!

01:33:33.075 --> 01:33:34.341
- Richard, you're
not making sense!

01:33:34.343 --> 01:33:36.977
(Richard sobs)

01:33:38.046 --> 01:33:40.113
Richard, just put
the knife down, okay?

01:33:40.115 --> 01:33:41.815
Just put the knife down.

01:33:41.817 --> 01:33:46.086
- [Sylvia] I told
you, now Gbemi's dead.

01:33:46.088 --> 01:33:48.655
I can't believe she's dead.

01:33:48.657 --> 01:33:51.758
- You bloody witch,
you killed her!

01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:52.959
- Just put the knife down.

01:33:52.961 --> 01:33:54.694
Just put the knife
down, and we'll talk.

01:33:54.696 --> 01:33:56.229
We gotta talk!

01:33:56.231 --> 01:33:59.799
(Richard screams)

01:33:59.801 --> 01:34:02.736
- Obaro.
- Richard, listen to me!

01:34:03.739 --> 01:34:06.940
(Richard screams)

01:34:06.942 --> 01:34:10.243
(knife clatters)

01:34:10.245 --> 01:34:12.712
(books thud)

01:34:14.983 --> 01:34:18.718
Hey, Richard, just calm down!

01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:21.821
(Richard screams)

01:34:28.330 --> 01:34:31.131
Get the knife!

01:34:33.335 --> 01:34:34.801
Get us some rope.

01:34:34.803 --> 01:34:39.673
Cynthia, get us some
rope, tie him down.

01:34:39.675 --> 01:34:40.674
Cynthia?

01:34:40.676 --> 01:34:43.743
- My name is Sylvia.

01:34:43.745 --> 01:34:46.379
(dramatic music)

01:35:00.462 --> 01:35:03.463
(Obaro sputters)

01:35:19.715 --> 01:35:21.081
- What did you do?

01:35:26.722 --> 01:35:28.121
What did you do?

01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:33.293
- No, Richard.

01:35:34.396 --> 01:35:35.795
What did you do?

01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:43.136
Man kills his wife
and best friend

01:35:43.138 --> 01:35:45.905
because he thinks
they're having an affair.

01:35:47.943 --> 01:35:49.843
That's what the press will say.

01:35:55.383 --> 01:36:00.120
And the way I see it,
you'll end up in jail

01:36:01.189 --> 01:36:02.188
or an asylum.

01:36:05.227 --> 01:36:07.761
Or you can come
with me, Richard,

01:36:10.098 --> 01:36:12.499
and we can start afresh.

01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:19.873
The choice is yours.

01:36:26.515 --> 01:36:29.349
(dramatic music)

01:37:33.615 --> 01:37:36.549
(Richard sighs)

01:37:56.605 --> 01:37:59.405
(Richard laughs)

01:38:01.943 --> 01:38:02.942
- You don't believe me.

01:38:07.482 --> 01:38:10.049
I don't blame you
for being skeptical.

01:38:10.652 --> 01:38:11.951
I've often wondered--

01:38:11.953 --> 01:38:14.020
- I actually believe you.

01:38:15.924 --> 01:38:16.623
- What?

01:38:21.129 --> 01:38:22.028
Really?

01:38:24.532 --> 01:38:25.431
- Yeah.

01:38:29.437 --> 01:38:31.537
I was going to give you this.

01:38:31.539 --> 01:38:34.374
(dramatic music)

01:38:37.045 --> 01:38:38.945
I ran into a lady
in there today,

01:38:40.015 --> 01:38:42.448
and she'd claimed she knew you.

01:38:43.685 --> 01:38:47.053
She told me to give
you the flower.

01:38:49.057 --> 01:38:53.693
I asked for her name, and
she said it wasn't necessary.

01:38:53.695 --> 01:38:56.529
(dramatic music)

01:39:00.468 --> 01:39:03.202
You said she was gonna
give you a second chance?

01:39:03.204 --> 01:39:06.039
(dramatic music)

01:39:23.491 --> 01:39:26.292
- Second chance
would still fail.

01:39:29.030 --> 01:39:31.097
I'd rather burn in Hell.

01:39:33.969 --> 01:39:36.669
(dramatic music)
