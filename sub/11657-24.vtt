00:42.800 --> 00:45.266
(mellow music playing)

01:02.300 --> 01:03.066
Morning, ma.

01:03.133 --> 01:04.367
Taste this.

01:07.934 --> 01:11.133
Mm... oh, it's awful.
What's the matter with it?

01:11.200 --> 01:12.633
It's expired.

01:13.967 --> 01:17.166
But sometimes it's good after the date.
I just wanted to check.

01:19.767 --> 01:21.367
You look tired, ma.

01:21.433 --> 01:23.467
-Rose kept me up all night.
-Oh, why?

01:23.533 --> 01:25.200
I don't know.
She was afraid of the storm.

01:25.266 --> 01:27.700
3:00 in the morning,
she knocks on my door,

01:27.767 --> 01:30.233
crying, begging, pleading
to get into bed with me.

01:30.300 --> 01:33.266
Just like your father used to do
before we got married.

01:35.533 --> 01:36.600
So, what did you do?

01:36.667 --> 01:38.467
I told him, "You're not getting anything

01:38.533 --> 01:41.633
until you put a ring on my finger
and a donkey in my father's barn."

01:43.467 --> 01:45.166
Not pop, Rose.

01:45.233 --> 01:47.567
I told her to get the hell
out of my room.

01:48.433 --> 01:51.533
Oh, Sophia,
I want to explain about last night.

01:51.600 --> 01:54.800
When I was a little girl, one summer,
we had a terrible thunderstorm--

01:54.867 --> 01:58.834
Excuse me, Rose. Have I given you
any indication at all that I care?

02:01.767 --> 02:03.834
Girls, my father's coming.

02:03.900 --> 02:06.767
Big daddy's coming. He just called.

02:06.834 --> 02:09.867
Oh, Big Daddy's gonna be
in Miami tomorrow.

02:09.934 --> 02:11.200
I can't believe it.

02:11.266 --> 02:15.967
I can't believe I know anyone
who calls her father Big Daddy.

02:16.033 --> 02:18.900
Back home,
everybody calls him Big Daddy.

02:18.967 --> 02:22.033
Why, he's the most respected
and beloved man in our town.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.000
Oh, for as long as I can remember,

02:24.066 --> 02:27.567
people from all over the county
would drive up to Twin Oaks...

02:27.633 --> 02:29.300
that's the name of our house...

02:30.133 --> 02:33.233
to ask Big Daddy's advice
on one thing or the other.

02:33.300 --> 02:36.467
And while the men were
discussing business on the veranda,

02:36.533 --> 02:40.000
the ladies would retire
to the shade of an old magnolia

02:40.066 --> 02:42.066
to sip mint juleps

02:42.133 --> 02:47.667
and exchange prize-winning
pecan pie recipes.

02:47.734 --> 02:49.800
Tell me, Blanche,
during any of this,

02:49.867 --> 02:52.467
would the farm hands
suddenly break into a chorus

02:52.533 --> 02:55.834
of "dem old cotton fields back home"?

02:55.900 --> 02:59.700
(chuckles) Well, maybe
I am exaggerating just a touch,

02:59.767 --> 03:02.166
but not about Big Daddy.

03:02.233 --> 03:03.934
Oh, he's a very special man.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.033
He has truly been a father
to everybody in our town.

03:13.800 --> 03:16.700
Your mother must have been
a very forgiving woman.

03:18.567 --> 03:19.600
Oh.

03:19.667 --> 03:22.266
I got a million things to do
before Big Daddy gets here.

03:22.333 --> 03:26.367
I have to go pick up his favorite food
and his favorite brandy and cigars.

03:26.433 --> 03:27.867
I want him to feel right at home.

03:27.934 --> 03:32.533
Then get the millers across the street
to tar and feather their lawn jockey.

03:34.967 --> 03:37.533
(sighs) I'm going to go out
on the lanai for awhile.

03:37.600 --> 03:40.200
The air's always so nice
and fresh after a storm.

03:40.266 --> 03:42.834
As long as you're out there, Rose,
why don't you pull some weeds?

03:42.900 --> 03:44.066
Okay.

03:45.066 --> 03:47.734
Ma, yesterday, you said
you were gonna pull the weeds.

03:47.800 --> 03:51.500
I said I'd get it done
and it's getting done, so lighten up.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.800
Dorothy, Sophia, come quick.

04:00.900 --> 04:02.967
Oh, my God.

04:03.033 --> 04:04.934
The storm must have
knocked it down last night.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.533
-Good morning, ladies.
-(Rose) Morning, Mr. Barton.

04:06.600 --> 04:08.133
Good morning, Mr. Barton.

04:08.200 --> 04:10.734
Well, looks like you had
a little bad luck here.

04:10.800 --> 04:13.300
Boy, we certainly did.
Any damage to your place?

04:13.367 --> 04:15.100
Nope. Not a scratch.

04:15.166 --> 04:16.700
Oh, thank goodness.

04:16.767 --> 04:18.667
If the wind had been blowing
in the opposite direction,

04:18.734 --> 04:20.800
your tree could have fallen
into your living room.

04:20.867 --> 04:22.700
What do you mean, my tree?

04:23.300 --> 04:25.734
She means your tree
because it was on your property.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.934
No way, lady. This is your tree.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.367
It's your responsibility.

04:29.433 --> 04:32.300
Oh, my goodness.
Our tree fell into your yard.

04:34.800 --> 04:37.133
Clam up, Gladys.
This is their tree.

04:37.200 --> 04:40.467
Look, there seems to be some
confusion here, but we are neighbors.

04:40.533 --> 04:43.433
What do you say we split the cost
and have the tree hauled away?

04:43.500 --> 04:46.367
What do you say you have it hauled away,
and I'll split.

04:46.433 --> 04:48.867
That does it.
You don't have any choice.

04:48.934 --> 04:51.533
You're hauling that tree away, <i>capisce?</i>

04:52.834 --> 04:54.934
You Italians have got some temper.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.867
You Italians?

04:56.934 --> 04:58.600
With disdain in his voice, he said it.

04:59.100 --> 05:00.567
Now you're going to pay.

05:08.367 --> 05:09.667
What... what are you doing?

05:09.734 --> 05:12.633
That's the evil eye.
I put a Sicilian curse on you.

05:12.700 --> 05:15.200
You're not gonna have a moment's peace
till you haul that tree away.

05:15.266 --> 05:18.700
You got me shaking in my boots.
Come on.

05:19.934 --> 05:21.233
Oh, ma, why'd you do that?

05:21.300 --> 05:24.233
You just made matters worse
with that ridiculous curse.

05:24.300 --> 05:27.266
Ridiculous? The curse works,
believe me. I've used it before.

05:27.333 --> 05:28.133
Oh, when?

05:28.200 --> 05:31.967
Baltimore Colts, New York Jets, 1969.

05:32.033 --> 05:33.467
Draw your own conclusions.

05:39.834 --> 05:42.367
(tranquil music playing)

05:45.033 --> 05:46.533
Ah, great news.

05:46.600 --> 05:50.233
I stopped by the courthouse this morning
and got a copy of our property map.

05:50.300 --> 05:55.467
The tree definitely belongs to Mr. Barton,
and it is his responsibility to remove it.

05:55.533 --> 05:57.433
Play it safe. Stick with the curse.

05:57.500 --> 06:02.133
Oh, ma, I've stayed with you
all these years.

06:13.967 --> 06:16.300
Ladies, how do I look?

06:18.200 --> 06:20.300
Like the night hostess at Denny's.

06:26.533 --> 06:29.834
This is exactly like the dress I wore
to my sweet 16.

06:29.900 --> 06:31.734
It was always Big Daddy's favorite.

06:31.800 --> 06:32.834
(doorbell rings)

06:32.900 --> 06:35.300
Oh, there he is now.

06:35.367 --> 06:40.033
Now listen, girls, my father is an
old-time southern aristocrat

06:40.100 --> 06:42.700
who is used to fine manners and gentility.

06:42.767 --> 06:46.500
So please, please, please
be on your best behavior.

06:52.700 --> 06:54.433
Why is everyone looking at me?

06:56.433 --> 06:57.467
Daddy.

06:57.533 --> 06:59.100
Where's the old lady? Aha.

06:59.166 --> 07:01.367
You looking for me, mouth?

07:03.667 --> 07:05.834
Ma. I'm glad you're here Mr. Barton.

07:05.900 --> 07:07.433
I went down to the courthouse
this morning and--

07:07.500 --> 07:08.800
This isn't a social call.

07:08.867 --> 07:10.767
This morning, when I got in my car,

07:10.834 --> 07:12.600
somebody let the air out of my tire.

07:12.667 --> 07:14.166
I know she did it.

07:14.233 --> 07:15.734
That's ridiculous.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.934
If I catch her on my property,
I'm gonna have her arrested.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.934
Mr. Barton, I assure you, my mother
had nothing to do with your tires.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.533
It was just a coincidence.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.633
Coincidence, my eye.

07:28.633 --> 07:29.867
Now, about the tree.

07:29.934 --> 07:33.300
I got a copy of our property map
at the courthouse this morning,

07:33.367 --> 07:37.166
and as you can clearly see,
the tree is yours.

07:37.233 --> 07:40.600
Ah. I'm not gonna move it,

07:40.667 --> 07:42.400
not after what she did.

07:42.467 --> 07:43.800
You have to.

07:43.867 --> 07:45.600
-Sue me.
-We will.

07:45.667 --> 07:47.433
Fine.
Fine.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.533
(gasps) That jerk!

07:49.600 --> 07:52.900
Trying to intimidate us.
Just who does he think he is?

07:52.967 --> 07:54.433
(doorbell rings)

07:54.500 --> 07:56.300
What is it, mouth?

07:59.667 --> 08:03.700
Back home, most people
start off with, "how do?"

08:05.166 --> 08:06.200
Daddy.

08:06.266 --> 08:09.600
Baby girl. Ha-ha-ha-ha.

08:09.667 --> 08:12.133
Looking at you
takes my breath away.

08:12.200 --> 08:16.033
Hair as shiny as the dew
on a field of sunflowers,

08:16.100 --> 08:18.800
eyes that sparkle bluer
than the Mississippi

08:18.867 --> 08:23.367
and the prettiest smile
on either side of the Mason-Dixon line.

08:23.433 --> 08:26.467
Didn't I tell you my daddy was the
smartest man who ever lived?

08:28.533 --> 08:32.633
You must be Sophia.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

08:36.200 --> 08:40.600
Excuse me for staring, ma'am,
but I've always felt

08:40.667 --> 08:44.734
that the stunning, classical
beauty of an I-talian woman

08:44.800 --> 08:48.133
should be admired
like a fine work of art.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.333
You need boots to listen to this guy.

09:00.233 --> 09:03.567
Daddy, I want you to meet
my best friends. This is Rose.

09:03.633 --> 09:04.433
Charmed.

09:04.500 --> 09:05.667
Hello. How do you do?

09:05.734 --> 09:07.533
Has anyone ever told you

09:07.600 --> 09:10.467
you are the spitting image
of Miss Dinah Shore?

09:13.166 --> 09:17.734
No. Oh, you're putting me on.

09:17.800 --> 09:19.266
Of course he is.

09:20.667 --> 09:23.333
And, daddy, this is Dorothy.

09:23.400 --> 09:26.200
I'm sorry. I hope I didn't offend you.

09:26.266 --> 09:28.266
No harm done, darlin'.

09:28.333 --> 09:30.767
Now, I want you to promise me
you won't fret none.

09:30.834 --> 09:35.467
Well, I would, except I'm not exactly sure
what "fret none" is.

09:36.934 --> 09:39.333
Oh, daddy, I'm so glad to see you.

09:39.400 --> 09:41.200
Get on over here
and sit down.

09:41.266 --> 09:44.000
I can't stay, honey.
I got some business to attend to.

09:44.066 --> 09:46.200
-Oh.
-But I'll be back later tonight.

09:46.266 --> 09:48.033
I got a surprise for you.

09:48.100 --> 09:49.600
Oh, did you get me something?

09:49.667 --> 09:51.700
What is it, what did you buy for me,
daddy?

09:51.767 --> 09:53.600
Well, nothin', sugar.

09:53.667 --> 09:55.467
Oh, fiddle-dee-dee.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.734
"Fiddle-dee-dee"?

10:00.800 --> 10:04.633
This is so much fun. It's like
being in <i>Gone With The Wind.</i>

10:06.066 --> 10:08.567
Well, then, what is the surprise, daddy?

10:08.633 --> 10:11.633
Well, I was gonna save it,
but what the heck.

10:12.734 --> 10:16.233
I'm singing at the Sagebrush Club
tomorrow night.

10:16.300 --> 10:18.066
You're doing what?

10:19.433 --> 10:22.433
I'm singing. That's my surprise.

10:22.500 --> 10:25.533
And I want you and your friends
to come as my guests.

10:25.600 --> 10:27.834
But why?

10:27.900 --> 10:30.467
Because, darlin',
I thought they might enjoy it.

10:30.533 --> 10:32.834
No, no. I mean why are you singing?

10:33.333 --> 10:36.934
It's my calling. It's what I do now.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.166
I'll explain it all to you later.

10:39.233 --> 10:41.633
Right now, I got to head over to the club
and check things out.

10:41.700 --> 10:42.467
But, but, daddy--

10:42.533 --> 10:46.700
And leave the key under the mat.
Ladies, see y'all later.

10:48.500 --> 10:51.500
(scoffs) I can't believe it.

10:51.567 --> 10:54.667
Neither can I. Free tickets.

10:55.433 --> 10:57.900
No, I'm talking about my daddy.

10:57.967 --> 11:01.333
Why, this singing thing
doesn't make any sense.

11:01.400 --> 11:03.367
You know, I'm worried about him.

11:03.433 --> 11:05.400
Maybe I ought to go call my sisters.

11:05.467 --> 11:08.600
Oh, come on, Blanche.
You're overreacting.

11:08.667 --> 11:11.734
If you're really concerned,
why don't you talk to him?

11:11.800 --> 11:14.100
You're right.
That's what I'm gonna do.

11:14.166 --> 11:17.266
I'm gonna stay completely objective
and keep an open mind.

11:17.333 --> 11:20.033
I'm sure there's some
perfectly logical explanation

11:20.100 --> 11:23.133
why my daddy's lost the stuffing
out of his comforter.

11:27.166 --> 11:30.200
(somber music playing)

11:36.500 --> 11:39.433
Oh, sorry, darlin'.
I didn't mean to wake you.

11:39.500 --> 11:41.900
Well, that's all right.
I waited up for you.

11:41.967 --> 11:43.100
I'm glad you did.

11:43.166 --> 11:46.166
I've been working on a new song,
and I want you to hear it.

11:46.233 --> 11:49.467
Listen, daddy, I want to talk to you
about this singing.

11:49.533 --> 11:52.533
It's been just wonderful, honey.
I love singing.

11:52.600 --> 11:55.200
Now, I know I'm just getting started
and I got a lot to learn,

11:55.266 --> 11:58.400
but the audiences will come around.
I'll do just fine.

11:58.467 --> 12:01.834
You know, you're talking about this
singing like it's some kind of career.

12:01.900 --> 12:05.133
Well, it is.
Now see what you think of this.

12:06.934 --> 12:09.667
(off-key)
<i>♪ Folks say I should settle down ♪</i>

12:09.734 --> 12:13.300
<i>♪ And make an honest living ♪</i>

12:13.367 --> 12:16.533
<i>♪ But I just want to sing my songs ♪</i>

12:16.600 --> 12:19.233
<i>♪ I got a lot to give 'em ♪</i>

12:20.433 --> 12:24.200
<i>♪ Give 'em... mm... </i>♪

12:24.266 --> 12:28.567
This part needs a little work.
And then now here's the chorus.

12:28.633 --> 12:34.400
<i>♪ It ain't gonna worry me for long ♪</i>

12:34.467 --> 12:37.333
<i>♪ I'll get up in the mornin' ♪</i>

<i>♪ And I'll still be singin' my song ♪</i>

12:44.000 --> 12:46.834
No, you won't, daddy.

12:46.900 --> 12:50.100
Now put that guitar down.
I want to talk to you.

12:50.166 --> 12:51.567
-What's the matter?
-(sighs)

12:51.633 --> 12:56.066
Well, I don't know what's gotten into you.
Daddy, you're no singer.

12:56.133 --> 12:58.667
Well, I know I'm no Hank Williams yet,
but...

12:58.734 --> 12:59.900
No, that's not what I meant.

12:59.967 --> 13:03.200
I mean, at your age,
just out of nowhere

13:03.266 --> 13:06.967
to decide you're gonna go off
and perform in some honky-tonk?

13:07.033 --> 13:09.867
I don't know about you,
but that sounds pretty crazy to me.

13:09.934 --> 13:11.867
Now don't you sass me, missy.

13:11.934 --> 13:15.066
No, I don't mean to sass you, daddy.

13:15.133 --> 13:16.900
It's just that I'm concerned about you.

13:16.967 --> 13:20.567
Now I want you to promise me that you're
going to forget all about this nonsense

13:20.633 --> 13:23.700
and go back to Twin Oaks
and have a nice, long rest.

13:24.600 --> 13:30.033
There's no Twin Oaks to go back to.
I sold it.

13:30.700 --> 13:32.533
You what?

13:32.600 --> 13:34.600
Sold it. Sold everything.

13:35.467 --> 13:39.433
Well, now, if I'm gonna go out on the road
and do this thing right, I need money.

13:39.500 --> 13:42.967
All right, this has gone far enough.

13:43.033 --> 13:46.166
I will not allow you to disgrace yourself
or your family.

13:46.233 --> 13:50.166
I absolutely forbid you to go on
with this foolishness one minute longer.

13:50.233 --> 13:53.900
You forbid Big Daddy?
You're the one who's gone crazy, girl.

13:56.200 --> 13:59.700
I'm sorry you had to witness
this spectacle, ladies.

14:00.533 --> 14:02.266
My apologies.

14:02.333 --> 14:04.333
Oh, Big Daddy, wait.

14:04.400 --> 14:05.266
Too late.

14:10.333 --> 14:14.333
You know, if there was
some rain coming down

14:14.400 --> 14:17.300
and a soft train whistle in the distance,

14:18.300 --> 14:20.567
this moment would have the makings

14:20.633 --> 14:22.767
of a first-rate country song.

14:25.367 --> 14:26.667
Bye, Blanche.

14:29.233 --> 14:32.700
(melancholy music playing)

14:39.433 --> 14:41.533
Oh, I feel awful, just awful.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.600
I shouldn't have lost my temper that way.

14:43.667 --> 14:44.800
Honey, you were upset.

14:44.867 --> 14:48.900
That's no excuse. Daddy obviously
doesn't know what he's doing.

14:48.967 --> 14:50.467
He's lost his grip on reality.

14:50.533 --> 14:53.567
Oh, honey. Maybe it's not
as serious as you think.

14:53.633 --> 14:56.300
Maybe he's just going through a stage.

14:56.367 --> 14:59.400
My father is not off
on some crazy lark, Dorothy.

14:59.467 --> 15:01.433
He sold our house and our land

15:01.500 --> 15:04.433
and everything he spent
his lifetime building.

15:04.500 --> 15:05.633
He needs help.

15:06.500 --> 15:07.233
(sighs)

15:07.767 --> 15:10.700
I never thought this could happen
to my father.

15:10.767 --> 15:15.166
Other people's parents get old
and grow frail and need taking care of,

15:15.233 --> 15:19.567
but somehow I'd always thought
Big Daddy would go on forever.

15:19.633 --> 15:22.934
Honey, we all think of our fathers
that way.

15:23.400 --> 15:27.900
We remember them as strong
and handsome and wise.

15:27.967 --> 15:29.367
When I think of my father,

15:29.433 --> 15:33.300
I always picture him
pulling a giant tuna up Main Street.

15:35.633 --> 15:37.967
Well, who doesn't, Rose?

15:38.567 --> 15:42.600
Oh, it wasn't a real tuna.
It was made of chrysanthemums.

15:42.667 --> 15:45.567
It was the float
in the Founder's Day parade.

15:46.867 --> 15:48.133
You probably don't know this,

15:48.200 --> 15:52.233
but my home town was founded
by Heinrich von Anderdonnen.

15:54.900 --> 15:58.467
The first man to ever can tuna
in its own natural juices.

16:00.133 --> 16:04.333
Anyway, it was the 50th-anniversary
celebration of the founding of our town,

16:04.400 --> 16:06.633
and my father was chosen
to pull the float.

16:07.266 --> 16:09.166
He thought it was 'cause
he had the newest tractor,

16:09.233 --> 16:11.867
but, actually, it was 'cause
he was the only one small enough

16:11.934 --> 16:14.166
to fit into the mayonnaise jar costume.

16:16.734 --> 16:21.600
Oh, I'll never forget the moment
we caught sight of him,

16:21.667 --> 16:24.033
turning off of Sycamore onto Elm.

16:24.100 --> 16:26.000
Something must have happened
to the tractor,

16:26.066 --> 16:30.533
'cause there he was,
this lone little mayonnaise jar

16:32.266 --> 16:37.233
dragging this giant tuna up the hill
and past the reviewing stand.

16:38.567 --> 16:41.667
I don't think I've ever been
prouder in my life.

16:44.567 --> 16:46.367
That's very touching, Rose.

16:47.233 --> 16:49.567
It shouldn't be, but it is.

16:50.700 --> 16:52.834
You know, when I think of my father,

16:52.900 --> 16:55.066
I don't remember just one incident.

16:56.066 --> 16:57.800
I just know that he was always there

16:57.867 --> 17:00.500
to take care of me
whenever I got into trouble,

17:00.567 --> 17:02.600
which was all the time.

17:02.667 --> 17:05.100
I just never dreamed
that the day would come

17:05.166 --> 17:07.767
when the tables would turn
and I'd have to take care of him.

17:09.467 --> 17:11.367
But I guess it has.

17:13.033 --> 17:15.667
(melancholy music playing)

17:18.834 --> 17:20.266
Sophia, why don't you come with us?

17:20.333 --> 17:22.700
It might be fun to hear
Blanche's father sing.

17:23.200 --> 17:25.867
To you, Rose, but what do you know
about a good time?

17:25.934 --> 17:26.934
(doorbell rings)

17:27.000 --> 17:29.900
Oh, Mr. And Mrs. Barton.
What can I do for you?

17:29.967 --> 17:31.300
I want to see the witch.

17:31.367 --> 17:35.033
Leonard... don't call her a witch.

17:35.100 --> 17:36.967
You'll get another boil on your butt.

17:41.767 --> 17:43.834
Tell the world, Gladys.

17:44.533 --> 17:46.333
Look, you've won.

17:46.400 --> 17:49.166
I'm begging you,
take off the curse, will you?

17:50.166 --> 17:52.633
My golf clubs are missing,
my clocks are all wrong,

17:52.700 --> 17:55.333
-I can't sleep, I can't eat.
-You can't sit.

17:57.900 --> 18:00.600
That, too. Please take it off.

18:00.667 --> 18:01.667
Move the tree.

18:01.734 --> 18:02.700
It'll be out of here tomorrow.

18:03.333 --> 18:04.433
You got a deal.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.266
Does that mean it's gone?

18:09.333 --> 18:12.033
That means I shouldn't eat asparagus
at dinner.

18:13.433 --> 18:14.433
Oh.

18:14.500 --> 18:15.600
(snaps finger)

18:15.667 --> 18:17.300
That means it's gone.

18:17.867 --> 18:19.233
Let's get out of here, Gladys.

18:19.300 --> 18:20.533
I'll be right there.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.533
I just wanted to apologize to you, ladies.

18:23.600 --> 18:26.867
Leonard has been just terrible
about this whole situation.

18:26.934 --> 18:28.834
That's why I did all those things to him.

18:29.300 --> 18:30.600
Oh.

18:31.834 --> 18:33.967
It was you all along.

18:34.033 --> 18:36.233
Except for the boil.
That was just luck.

18:38.667 --> 18:40.867
Gladys, we've got to go.

18:41.400 --> 18:43.700
Listen, ladies, if there's
anything that I can do for you

18:43.767 --> 18:48.200
to improve our relationship,
I'd be happy to oblige.

18:48.767 --> 18:50.467
There is one small thing.

18:50.967 --> 18:51.834
In the morning,

18:51.900 --> 18:55.633
when you go out in your robe
to pick up the newspaper...

18:55.700 --> 18:57.200
wear your shorts.

19:05.300 --> 19:07.633
(tranquil music playing)

19:19.367 --> 19:21.500
I've never been in a place like this.

19:21.567 --> 19:23.433
Are these all real cowboys?

19:23.500 --> 19:24.900
Of course, Rose.

19:24.967 --> 19:27.000
You can tell because
they wear cowboy hats

19:27.066 --> 19:30.266
and drink wine spritzers
and drive Volvos.

19:32.333 --> 19:34.166
Uh, Blanche, who do we see
about our table?

19:34.233 --> 19:37.433
Oh, I don't know. This is the first time
I've ever been here.

19:37.500 --> 19:39.333
Well, howdy, Blanche.

19:39.800 --> 19:42.300
Hi there, Blanche. Ladies.

19:42.367 --> 19:43.667
No, I'm wrong.

19:43.734 --> 19:46.767
I think the museum did have
its Christmas party here.

19:46.834 --> 19:48.667
(cheering)

19:48.734 --> 19:49.567
What's that noise?

19:49.633 --> 19:52.700
Oh, they have a mechanical bull
in the backroom.

19:52.767 --> 19:55.700
I read about it in the <i>Sunday Supplement.</i>

19:55.767 --> 19:59.533
What on earth do you do
with a mechanical bull?

20:00.000 --> 20:02.934
Introduce him
to a mechanical cow, Rose.

20:03.667 --> 20:04.967
Uh, excuse me.

20:05.033 --> 20:07.500
We're supposed to have reservations
for the second show.

20:07.567 --> 20:08.867
The name's Devereaux.

20:08.934 --> 20:12.834
Okay, let's see.
Uh, mm-mmm.

20:12.900 --> 20:14.600
I'm sorry. I don't seem
to have you listed.

20:14.667 --> 20:17.867
Oh, well, maybe it's under
the name of Hollingsworth.

20:17.934 --> 20:19.433
-Hollingsworth?
-Mm-hmm.

20:19.500 --> 20:21.567
Uh, you're not here to see
Big Daddy Hollingsworth?

20:21.633 --> 20:23.166
Yes, we are.

20:23.233 --> 20:24.967
I'm sorry, you just missed him.

20:25.033 --> 20:28.500
But we thought the second show
doesn't start until nine.

20:28.567 --> 20:32.433
It doesn't. But after the first show,
the management canceled his booking.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.133
Oh.

20:34.200 --> 20:37.200
I was afraid that would happen.
Do you know where he went?

20:37.266 --> 20:39.233
I guess he's backstage somewhere.

20:39.300 --> 20:41.734
You go on, honey. Talk to him.
We'll wait right here.

20:41.800 --> 20:42.834
Thank you.

20:46.567 --> 20:48.667
Howdy, ladies. My name's Rusty.

20:48.734 --> 20:52.200
I don't recollect seeing you two fillies
'round these parts.

20:52.266 --> 20:55.266
Mind if a lonesome cowboy
puts his saddlebags 'round your campfire?

20:55.333 --> 20:57.800
Give us a break, would you, Mac?

21:01.033 --> 21:03.333
Howdy, ma'am.
My name's Rusty.

21:08.800 --> 21:09.667
Daddy.

21:09.734 --> 21:12.433
Sugar. I didn't expect to see you here.

21:12.500 --> 21:15.967
Daddy, I just heard what happened,
and I'm so sorry, I truly am.

21:16.033 --> 21:18.433
Oh, don't worry. It's my own fault.

21:18.500 --> 21:20.133
If I wasn't such a stubborn old fool...

21:20.200 --> 21:21.700
Now don't be hard on yourself.

21:21.767 --> 21:26.000
It's true. I never should have
tried that Beatle medley.

21:28.400 --> 21:31.533
Next time, I'm gonna stick
with the material I know.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.400
You mean you intend to go on with this?

21:33.467 --> 21:34.400
Why not?

21:34.467 --> 21:37.900
Honey, because they didn't like you.
That's why not.

21:37.967 --> 21:39.367
You weren't any good.

21:39.433 --> 21:41.600
Honey, I know I'm not any good.

21:42.266 --> 21:43.600
Then I don't understand.

21:43.667 --> 21:44.734
What?

21:44.800 --> 21:47.200
(scoffs) Well, I don't understand

21:47.266 --> 21:51.133
how... how the man I have admired
and respected all my life

21:51.200 --> 21:54.066
can turn himself into a clown.

21:55.200 --> 21:58.367
Blanche, honey,

21:58.433 --> 22:00.266
ever since I was a boy,

22:00.333 --> 22:03.900
I've never been satisfied
with what was easy.

22:03.967 --> 22:08.500
I always wanted to try new things,
see new places.

22:08.567 --> 22:12.967
But before I had a chance to do something
like hop a tramp steamer,

22:13.033 --> 22:17.667
I met up with a lady by the name of
Elizabeth Ann Bennett.

22:18.500 --> 22:20.533
She had the cutest little smile,

22:20.600 --> 22:23.333
tiniest button nose

22:23.400 --> 22:26.834
and the most incredible blue eyes
I had ever seen.

22:27.633 --> 22:29.934
Those are the things
you inherited from her.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.066
And when I looked into those eyes,

22:32.133 --> 22:36.367
they told me it was not time
to go off chasing rainbows.

22:36.433 --> 22:39.734
It was time to make a life
for the two of us.

22:39.800 --> 22:42.133
And I never regretted that decision,

22:42.200 --> 22:44.133
because I knew that someday,

22:44.200 --> 22:46.934
we'd go off chasing
those rainbows together.

22:48.433 --> 22:51.667
But when the time finally came,

22:52.767 --> 22:56.467
all that was left
was a big, empty house

22:57.800 --> 23:00.467
and the headstone
that marks her grave.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.633
And I decided that,

23:04.567 --> 23:09.333
before it was time for us
to be together again,

23:09.400 --> 23:12.500
I was gonna go off
and have that adventure.

23:12.567 --> 23:15.433
Now, granted,
this is no tramp steamer,

23:15.500 --> 23:19.033
but it's something, something
I've always wanted to do.

23:19.100 --> 23:22.533
And, sugar, I think that now
is finally the time to do it.

23:22.600 --> 23:24.934
But why didn't you
tell me that before?

23:25.000 --> 23:26.800
I didn't think I needed to.

23:26.867 --> 23:30.600
I... I figured if I was happy,
you were happy, too.

23:30.667 --> 23:34.066
Oh, daddy. I'm so sorry.

23:34.133 --> 23:37.100
You've always been there for me.
I should've been there for you.

23:37.166 --> 23:40.100
And you think you can ever forgive me?

23:40.166 --> 23:43.100
Darlin', life's too short

23:43.166 --> 23:45.934
to not forgive my favorite little girl.

23:48.734 --> 23:49.533
I love you.

23:49.600 --> 23:51.400
I love you, too.

23:52.400 --> 23:58.600
