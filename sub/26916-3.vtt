WEBVTT

00:11.040 --> 00:13.200
[Uhtred] I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.

00:13.760 --> 00:17.920
My Gisela has died in childbirth,
killed by our newborn son.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.960
The King's health, it worsens.

00:20.040 --> 00:22.760
[Uhtred] King Alfred
has little time left to him

00:22.840 --> 00:25.640
and his enemies are swarming,
intent on power.

00:25.720 --> 00:29.200
What I want
is your disloyalty towards Alfred.

00:29.280 --> 00:32.240
[Uhtred] But his heir, Edward,
is not ready to succeed.

00:33.560 --> 00:37.000
Threatening the King
and now banished from Wessex,

00:37.080 --> 00:39.680
I have fled back to my true family...

00:39.760 --> 00:41.240
I am a Dane for life.

00:41.320 --> 00:44.360
...making traitors of my men
loyal to Wessex.

00:44.440 --> 00:46.920
I did not come here
to talk of war against Alfred.

00:47.480 --> 00:53.000
[Uhtred] I have stolen a seer, Skade,
from the Danish warrior, Earl Sigurd.

00:53.080 --> 00:56.680
She was my prize,
but she holds me under her spell.

00:56.760 --> 01:00.720
The world is in crisis,
and Alfred's daughter, the Lady of Mercia,

01:00.800 --> 01:03.600
-is threatened by her own husband.
-I want her dead.

01:03.680 --> 01:07.760
It would be of great comfort
to know that I could call upon you again.

01:08.520 --> 01:09.920
[Uhtred] Destiny is all.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
[theme music playing]

01:58.960 --> 01:59.880
[exhales]

02:11.680 --> 02:14.480
You cannot escape who you are, arseling.

02:15.440 --> 02:17.920
Blood and bone, you are Bebbanburg.

02:19.360 --> 02:21.360
[breathing heavily]

02:23.640 --> 02:24.640
[Osferth] Lord.

02:28.840 --> 02:30.640
What is it, Osferth?

02:30.720 --> 02:33.320
Forgive me, Lord, I have not said.

02:35.480 --> 02:37.560
I loved her, Lady Gisela.

02:39.840 --> 02:41.520
I mean, not as you loved her, but...

02:44.720 --> 02:46.560
She was always kind to me, Lord.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.040
Always.

02:50.440 --> 02:52.640
I'll pray for her soul,
if that's acceptable.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.560
It is, Osferth. Thank you.

03:02.360 --> 03:04.320
You have made him a traitor.

03:07.920 --> 03:09.480
He's made his choice...

03:11.520 --> 03:13.040
and I have made mine.

03:14.080 --> 03:15.480
You made no choice.

03:17.280 --> 03:20.640
If you had not killed the monk,
you would still be Alfred's oathman.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.920
Then I'm glad I killed the monk.

03:28.320 --> 03:29.320
I am Dane.

04:05.840 --> 04:08.760
-Have you finished your food, Lady?
-I have. Thank you.

04:09.320 --> 04:11.640
Reading in candlelight
will cost you your eyes.

04:11.720 --> 04:15.320
There is a thegn requesting to fell
three large trees from my land

04:15.400 --> 04:17.040
to help build a new hall.

04:17.120 --> 04:19.000
You grant him three trees, Lady,

04:19.079 --> 04:21.800
and he invites you to share food
with him and his wife.

04:21.880 --> 04:23.840
-Then he'll wield you...
-[chuckles]

04:23.920 --> 04:26.720
...telling everyone
that you and him are the best of friends.

04:27.040 --> 04:31.800
Unless he's paying you handsomely,
your trees deserve better.

04:40.560 --> 04:42.000
[dogs barking in distance]

04:56.480 --> 04:57.720
[Sable shushes]

05:23.000 --> 05:25.280
Lady, do not make a sound.
I mean you no harm.

05:25.360 --> 05:27.560
It is Aldhelm.
No one can know why I've come.

05:27.640 --> 05:30.600
I'll say what needs to be said
and then I'll leave. I swear.

05:31.160 --> 05:32.440
I will take my hand away.

05:37.800 --> 05:40.440
By all means, hold it,
but I beg you do not use it.

05:40.520 --> 05:43.520
Then speak.
Make it quick and make it plain. Speak.

05:43.600 --> 05:46.920
Lady, you must leave. For your
own safety, you must leave Mercia.

05:47.840 --> 05:50.760
-Tell me why I must leave.
-Your husband wants to kill you.

05:52.080 --> 05:54.400
He wants you killed,
and blame rogues for it.

05:54.480 --> 05:57.080
-He would never--
-It's true. Why else would I say it?

05:57.280 --> 05:59.000
-To have me leave voluntarily?
-No.

05:59.080 --> 06:01.000
Have me killed here,
then it could be rogues.

06:01.080 --> 06:01.960
Lady, no.

06:02.040 --> 06:05.640
Why else would you tell me?
You have never been a friend.

06:06.240 --> 06:07.600
You are my husband's hound.

06:08.200 --> 06:10.880
All of which is true.
To say otherwise would be a lie.

06:10.960 --> 06:12.760
And it is not the time for lies.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.520
I am here because I am a Mercian.

06:15.520 --> 06:17.880
And 'cause I believe
that we would be a poorer land

06:17.960 --> 06:19.480
without the Lady of Mercia.

06:21.200 --> 06:22.760
You have a suitor's tongue.

06:23.720 --> 06:25.680
I cannot believe you, and I will not.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.200
You have no reason to,

06:27.280 --> 06:29.840
but I swear on my life and to God,
it is true.

06:32.240 --> 06:34.360
If I run and then return,
my father by my side?

06:34.440 --> 06:36.040
Again, I beg you, do not.

06:36.120 --> 06:38.720
Mercia needs Wessex.
Alliances must not alter.

06:39.200 --> 06:42.040
And Wessex too is changing.
Your father weakens,

06:42.720 --> 06:45.280
and Uhtred, he has fled north a traitor.

06:45.360 --> 06:48.840
No, that is a lie. He would never.
Uhtred would never break an oath.

06:48.920 --> 06:52.080
What else would have him dare
to kill you? One has followed the other.

06:55.080 --> 06:56.400
I am here for Mercia.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.560
Believe me, I speak the truth.

07:00.960 --> 07:02.640
Then you have betrayed my husband.

07:04.240 --> 07:05.840
Only you and I know about this.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.160
I shall remain at his side.

07:08.840 --> 07:12.040
He is of Mercia
and he is no coward on the battlefield,

07:12.600 --> 07:15.000
but he is not the king
I hoped he would become.

07:16.480 --> 07:17.680
Nor the husband you deserve.

07:19.120 --> 07:20.640
I shall leave now, quietly,

07:21.560 --> 07:23.280
and you must do the same,

07:23.360 --> 07:25.280
for the sake of the land we both love.

07:28.840 --> 07:32.440
Lord Aldhelm... you have my thanks.

07:32.520 --> 07:33.680
Lady.

07:39.480 --> 07:41.160
[indistinct chatter]

07:41.240 --> 07:44.800
Forgive me, Godric, for dragging you
and your men from your beds.

07:45.360 --> 07:49.680
We are headed to the nunnery at Wincelcumb
for a short period of prayer, that is all.

07:49.760 --> 07:50.760
For your father?

07:52.080 --> 07:53.240
Yes.

07:53.320 --> 07:55.880
Though I shall ensure
there is ale and good food.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.400
Nothing more you wish to tell us?

07:59.640 --> 08:00.600
There is not.

08:01.920 --> 08:02.760
Thank you.

08:08.480 --> 08:11.240
Sable, the letters. You know what to do.

08:11.320 --> 08:12.480
I do, Lady.

08:13.040 --> 08:14.400
God will be with you.

08:15.560 --> 08:17.400
See no one but Father Beocca.

08:18.280 --> 08:19.440
Yes, Lady.

08:21.360 --> 08:22.840
You have the will of a queen.

08:45.600 --> 08:49.040
My entire life as king
shall be recorded within this chronicle.

08:52.960 --> 08:55.840
On my table
is a list of possible wives for Edward.

08:55.920 --> 08:57.440
I would like your opinion.

08:58.240 --> 09:00.640
Yes, of course, Lord,
though I am no expert.

09:03.160 --> 09:05.920
These are the names
of ealdormen and thegns, Lord.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.520
Does each man have a daughter?

09:07.600 --> 09:09.720
I don't know. That's for you to establish.

09:10.840 --> 09:14.560
The thegns are all of Cent and Wiltunscir.
The bride must be of the lower lands.

09:14.640 --> 09:17.600
We must undo the damage
done by Edward and his...

09:18.800 --> 09:20.040
errant behavior.

09:20.120 --> 09:22.240
Behavior that is to be expected

09:22.320 --> 09:25.720
-from a young man, Lord.
-Wessex... [gasps, breathes heavily]

09:26.600 --> 09:28.760
Wessex must remain united.

09:30.240 --> 09:32.360
Is My Lord feeling unwell?

09:34.640 --> 09:37.760
My Lord must part company
with the little he had for his breakfast.

09:37.840 --> 09:39.120
You will excuse me.

09:40.760 --> 09:44.560
I will attend to the matter
of suitors, of brides, Lady.

09:44.640 --> 09:47.720
It is not the daughter
we are choosing, Father Beocca.

09:48.440 --> 09:50.440
It is her father and his standing.

09:51.480 --> 09:54.600
You will choose Aethelhelm.
Lord Aethelhelm.

09:54.680 --> 09:56.480
He is an ealdorman of Wiltunscir.

09:57.040 --> 10:00.520
His purse is full,
his fyrd numbers one thousand men or more,

10:00.600 --> 10:03.840
and fortunately, his daughter
is both fair and in good health.

10:04.600 --> 10:07.360
-The King will approve.
-He will?

10:08.520 --> 10:10.840
Send for Aethelhelm.

10:10.920 --> 10:13.600
Visit him if you must,
but do not dwell on the matter.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.640
Beocca. Father Beocca.

10:30.640 --> 10:33.920
Forgive the intrusion.
Um, I need to unburden.

10:34.880 --> 10:37.200
-It is Edward.
-What of him?

10:37.760 --> 10:40.280
Well, he claims to be married already.

10:41.160 --> 10:42.160
Married by whom?

10:44.240 --> 10:46.280
Who carried out this ceremony?

10:47.520 --> 10:48.760
It was a priest.

10:48.840 --> 10:51.480
I suspect your son
is playing a game, Lord.

10:51.560 --> 10:52.560
[Edward] It's no game.

10:52.640 --> 10:55.880
Lord, I could not ignore
what he has disclosed.

10:56.400 --> 10:59.760
I am married to Ecgwynn. [clears throat]

11:00.800 --> 11:03.800
I can only suggest
that we ask the girl directly.

11:03.880 --> 11:06.280
You cannot do that.
She is gentle and delicate.

11:06.360 --> 11:07.880
Neither of which prevented you

11:07.960 --> 11:10.960
from jumping upon her
at the first opportunity.

11:11.040 --> 11:12.880
You either give me the name of the priest

11:12.960 --> 11:15.840
or I send for your delicate whore.
Which will it be?

11:15.920 --> 11:17.640
I will say nothing more.

11:18.480 --> 11:22.160
Edward, you will do as your king commands.

11:22.240 --> 11:24.080
Or you will have me killed?

11:24.160 --> 11:25.760
You will hold your tongue.

11:26.640 --> 11:28.680
And remember that you are the aetheling.

11:28.760 --> 11:32.240
-And what if I do not wish to become king?
-It is your duty!

11:38.920 --> 11:42.640
Bishop Erkenwald, you will escort
the future king of Wessex

11:42.720 --> 11:44.000
to the nearest monastery

11:44.080 --> 11:46.400
where he shall pray every hour of the day

11:46.480 --> 11:48.680
-and night...
-I wish to remain at the palace.

11:48.760 --> 11:50.520
...until God makes him realize

11:50.600 --> 11:54.720
that being king is not a pastime,
not a choice, but a duty.

11:54.800 --> 11:56.400
[breathes heavily]

11:59.080 --> 12:02.160
Your wife will be dealt with.

12:03.520 --> 12:06.920
You shall never dare put at risk
all that I have achieved.

12:43.080 --> 12:44.240
[Aldhelm] News, Lord.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.240
-Lord.
-Well?

12:49.920 --> 12:52.480
The house was empty. No persons there.

12:53.280 --> 12:55.120
The Lady Aethelflaed is gone.

12:55.880 --> 12:59.000
There is not so much as a servant
or... or a guard, Lord.

13:02.320 --> 13:03.480
[gasping]

13:03.560 --> 13:05.200
She must have been forewarned...

13:06.200 --> 13:07.200
by you.

13:12.880 --> 13:16.160
Lord, you cannot simply
execute your subjects as you please.

13:16.240 --> 13:17.880
This is the ninth century.

13:18.960 --> 13:20.080
She has gone where?

13:20.960 --> 13:22.560
It is too late to ask him.

13:23.240 --> 13:24.800
Are you laughing at me?

13:24.880 --> 13:26.200
I am not, Lord.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.600
But maybe it's for the best
that Aethelflaed lives.

13:29.680 --> 13:30.840
The best for whom?

13:31.480 --> 13:34.360
When Alfred eventually decides to depart,

13:35.280 --> 13:37.200
we must be made welcome in Winchester.

13:37.280 --> 13:39.040
-Otherwise--
-You'll find out where she is

13:39.120 --> 13:40.960
and ensure she is dispatched.

13:42.040 --> 13:45.240
You should leave her in her peace, Lord.
That is my advice.

13:45.320 --> 13:51.000
Find her and give her circumstance
and whereabouts to the Danes, any Dane.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.480
-Yes, Lord.
-[man choking]

13:54.600 --> 13:56.200
Why are you not dead yet?

13:56.800 --> 13:58.440
You, finish him.

14:06.440 --> 14:10.000
-You are done for, my friend.
-[man groaning]

14:13.360 --> 14:15.080
As we may all be done for.

14:18.200 --> 14:21.040
[Ragnar] We are divided, it seems.

14:23.440 --> 14:25.680
We are two people...

14:28.320 --> 14:29.480
it seems.

14:29.560 --> 14:31.160
[crowd laughs]

14:31.240 --> 14:34.480
Over here, we have the ugly...

14:34.560 --> 14:36.360
[crowd laughing]

14:37.720 --> 14:38.920
...the unwashed...

14:40.520 --> 14:42.680
the shit-smelling...

14:44.360 --> 14:46.480
the pig-humping...

14:48.000 --> 14:50.440
-frog-licking...
-Frog-licking?

14:50.520 --> 14:52.360
...the Rome-worshipping...

14:53.280 --> 14:57.520
ugly, frog-licking Saxons!

14:57.600 --> 14:59.600
[crowd cheering]

15:01.120 --> 15:03.440
That is who we are!

15:03.520 --> 15:04.840
But we do not lick frogs.

15:04.920 --> 15:08.880
They face, in a battle of strength...

15:10.320 --> 15:12.440
-the pretty...
-[crowd cheering]

15:15.360 --> 15:18.720
-...the sweet-smelling...
-Whoo-hoo!

15:18.800 --> 15:21.560
-...the light-of-foot...
-Apple-cheeked!

15:21.640 --> 15:24.200
...the apple-cheeked,

15:24.280 --> 15:29.200
golden-haired boys of Denmark and beyond!

15:29.280 --> 15:30.560
[crowd cheering]

15:30.640 --> 15:32.600
Ragnar, you are a skald, not a warrior.

15:32.680 --> 15:34.360
I have the gift, I really do.

15:35.160 --> 15:38.120
Now, you may take the rope.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.320
[Finan] Come on, let's do this! Come on.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.080
Look at him, he loves it.

15:42.160 --> 15:45.160
-Are you prepared?
-He'd play games every day if he could.

15:45.240 --> 15:47.720
Is there spit in your hands?

15:48.440 --> 15:50.680
Good earth beneath your feet?

15:50.760 --> 15:52.360
Come on! Get on with it, Ragnar.

15:52.440 --> 15:53.800
[Finan] Let's do this!

15:53.880 --> 15:55.360
-Pull!
-[crowd cheering]

16:17.440 --> 16:20.560
-[Ragnar] Saxons! Pull!
-[all shouting indistinctly]

16:20.640 --> 16:23.200
[Ragnar] Pull! Pull!

16:23.280 --> 16:24.920
-Are you a Dane? Pull!
-Yes!

16:25.000 --> 16:27.520
-[straining]
-You never tire of this game.

16:27.600 --> 16:31.480
If only all wars were fought this way!

16:31.560 --> 16:35.040
Pull, you bastards!

16:35.600 --> 16:37.640
[players groaning]

16:37.720 --> 16:38.840
[all laughing]

16:38.920 --> 16:43.560
Ragnar, son of the fearless,
is the victor!

16:43.640 --> 16:45.440
[crowd cheering]

16:46.000 --> 16:51.360
He brings 20 men on their arse
while drinking ale!

16:51.440 --> 16:53.240
[cheering continues]

16:53.320 --> 16:55.440
-You are life itself.
-[laughing]

16:55.520 --> 16:57.440
-[bell ringing]
-Ragnar!

16:58.440 --> 17:00.440
We're playing games, can't you see that?

17:00.520 --> 17:02.240
Ragnar, it is the watchman.

17:04.599 --> 17:06.520
The gate, open it.

17:08.280 --> 17:09.200
[Uhtred] Ragnar?

17:09.280 --> 17:11.520
My watchmen do not return for no reason.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.760
-What is it?
-Men and horses, Lord.

17:16.640 --> 17:18.200
-Warriors.
-How many?

17:18.280 --> 17:20.960
Forty or fifty. I don't recognize them.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.560
Spears and arrows to the walls

17:22.640 --> 17:24.800
till we know who they are,
what they want.

17:24.880 --> 17:26.480
-Hold your aims.
-Finan.

17:26.560 --> 17:27.839
Bar the gate.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.400
[breathing heavily]

17:34.080 --> 17:36.080
[Skade whispering incantations]

17:38.120 --> 17:39.920
-[horses neighing in distance]
-[gasps]

17:40.000 --> 17:41.200
He is here.

17:49.880 --> 17:52.960
He is here and I will refuse him.

18:00.720 --> 18:01.960
They are Danes.

18:02.040 --> 18:02.960
-[Brida] Hmm.
-Yes.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.040
[Uhtred] Definitely.

18:08.760 --> 18:11.240
I recognize one of them. Two of them.

18:11.760 --> 18:13.360
It is Haesten and Bloodhair.

18:14.040 --> 18:15.480
[Ragnar] The Earl Sigurd?

18:16.000 --> 18:17.720
Neither are fond of me.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.240
For what reason, I wonder.

18:22.960 --> 18:26.280
[Haesten] Earl Ragnar, I am Haesten.

18:27.080 --> 18:30.800
[Ragnar] We know who you are.
The question is, what do you want?

18:31.920 --> 18:37.800
Shelter, food, ale, warmth
and negotiation, perhaps.

18:37.880 --> 18:40.960
Negotiation? Are we at war?

18:41.040 --> 18:43.880
[chuckles] It is what we do, Lord.

18:44.760 --> 18:47.280
Discussion would be a better word.

18:48.360 --> 18:50.920
[Uhtred] You are a long way
from Beamfleot, Haesten.

18:51.000 --> 18:51.960
Uhtred?

18:52.520 --> 18:55.080
Believe me, it could be
a pleasure to see you here.

18:55.160 --> 18:56.640
So it is true.

18:57.880 --> 18:59.800
You are no longer Alfred's oathman.

19:02.720 --> 19:03.920
It is true.

19:05.040 --> 19:07.160
And you?
Are you still Alfred's oathman?

19:07.240 --> 19:09.760
[chuckles] He believes so.

19:10.320 --> 19:14.800
And Earl Sigurd, Bloodhair,
what do you have to say?

19:15.560 --> 19:18.520
I say we're tired and hungry
and my arse is sore.

19:19.280 --> 19:21.160
You can't refuse them, Ragnar.

19:23.880 --> 19:26.320
Do you have anything
to say to me, Bloodhair?

19:26.400 --> 19:29.440
Last time I saw you,
you were running for your life.

19:30.160 --> 19:34.520
Yes. You took what belongs to me.
We have that matter to settle.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.200
[Uthred] It is settled.

19:37.120 --> 19:41.160
It can wait.
It may even be resolved peacefully.

19:41.240 --> 19:43.360
Brida is right, we cannot refuse them.

19:46.520 --> 19:50.080
You leave your swords at the gate.
You have our respect.

19:50.800 --> 19:53.560
There will be no argument, I swear.

19:54.800 --> 19:56.160
[Ragnar] Open the gate.

19:56.240 --> 19:57.720
[man] Open the gate!

19:57.800 --> 20:02.800
They are here for one thing only,
to speak of war and of Alfred.

20:06.680 --> 20:08.840
Lord. Aethelwold.

20:26.160 --> 20:29.600
Uhtred. I was just about to find you.
[breathing heavily]

20:31.080 --> 20:33.360
What is it you believe you are doing?

20:34.200 --> 20:36.560
-You know what I'm doing.
-Mmm?

20:37.360 --> 20:41.280
I'm seizing a chance to take what is mine,
an opportunity.

20:41.360 --> 20:45.840
Aethelwold, you are here for amusement
and nothing else.

20:47.680 --> 20:51.120
Your rightful place
is the alehouse in Winchester.

20:51.800 --> 20:53.400
Don't dare believe you're above that.

20:53.480 --> 20:57.000
I am as much King of Wessex
as you are Lord of Bebbanburg.

20:57.640 --> 20:59.680
Both of us usurped by an uncle.

21:00.680 --> 21:02.320
I won't let this chance pass--

21:02.400 --> 21:03.600
Where is your honor?

21:05.280 --> 21:08.080
You are meant to be
the son of a king of Wessex.

21:08.840 --> 21:10.000
You do not belong here.

21:10.080 --> 21:13.880
My crown was stolen, and thanks to you, I
now have the opportunity to take it back.

21:15.800 --> 21:18.000
Make no mistake,
we are the same, you and I.

21:18.960 --> 21:22.280
Apparent traitors to Wessex,
but for good cause.

21:25.280 --> 21:28.280
We are not the same and never shall be.

21:29.760 --> 21:34.080
There is no backward step, my friend,
for either of us.

21:35.240 --> 21:37.480
Birds have flown, horses have bolted.

21:39.120 --> 21:41.280
Kings will be made and kings will die.

21:42.680 --> 21:43.920
Because of you.

21:59.160 --> 22:00.160
Lord...

22:03.280 --> 22:05.720
I am leaving for home and for my bed.

22:06.560 --> 22:08.000
Are there any other matters?

22:11.480 --> 22:13.480
-Sleep well, Lord.
-Uhtred's children.

22:15.640 --> 22:17.480
He has abandoned them?

22:18.600 --> 22:20.520
No, Lord, not quite.

22:21.080 --> 22:23.600
The Abbess Hild is providing
for the children.

22:23.680 --> 22:25.360
Coccham is no longer their place.

22:26.320 --> 22:30.520
It is no longer Uhtred's estate.
It is no longer home to his seed.

22:33.760 --> 22:35.480
Have them brought to Winchester...

22:36.480 --> 22:38.760
arrange for their welfare and education.

22:39.760 --> 22:41.160
Introduce them to God.

22:44.200 --> 22:45.920
Rest well, Father Beocca.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.560
Yes, Lord. Rest well.

22:54.520 --> 22:56.520
[indistinct chatter]

22:59.840 --> 23:01.960
-[Beocca] Go on, move!
-[chickens clucking]

23:04.600 --> 23:06.680
You will not believe what Alfred
has asked me.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.680
Beocca, this is Sable.

23:10.840 --> 23:13.800
-She has news of Aethelflaed.
-[exhales]

23:18.200 --> 23:20.240
-She is safe, you say?
-[Sable] She is.

23:20.320 --> 23:22.440
She has gone to the nunnery at Wincelcumb.

23:23.680 --> 23:26.040
To be guarded
by Mercia's most fierce nuns.

23:26.120 --> 23:28.120
The King must not know.

23:29.240 --> 23:32.040
But if we say nothing to the King,
if we withhold the knowledge

23:32.120 --> 23:34.680
of a threat to Aethelflaed's life,
that's treachery.

23:34.760 --> 23:36.120
It is what My Lady wishes.

23:36.200 --> 23:38.320
It is what she wishes, not I.

23:38.400 --> 23:41.840
Father, she does not want
the King disturbed, for good reason.

23:41.920 --> 23:44.440
Nor the bond between our two lands broken.

23:45.360 --> 23:48.960
I understand her wanting Wessex
and Mercia to remain allies.

23:49.720 --> 23:52.240
But if talk of the King's illness
is emboldening,

23:52.320 --> 23:54.360
creating enemies of Wessex,
we can't stand by.

23:54.440 --> 23:55.760
Father, will you help us?

23:57.280 --> 23:58.400
We will.

24:00.440 --> 24:03.160
How? By doing what?

24:03.240 --> 24:05.360
By traveling to the nunnery myself?

24:05.440 --> 24:07.120
[Sable] There is a second letter.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.440
I'm to give it to you only if you agree

24:09.520 --> 24:12.000
with My Lady's reasoning
for not telling the King.

24:15.720 --> 24:17.400
It is a solution.

24:29.920 --> 24:32.320
He is always the solution, it seems.

24:32.400 --> 24:33.760
What?

24:34.480 --> 24:37.800
Aethelflaed has arranged a ship.
It is waiting for us on the Temes.

24:38.440 --> 24:41.360
She thinks it will be
both quicker and safer.

24:43.680 --> 24:44.800
To take us where?

24:44.880 --> 24:48.400
To take us north, dear. To the solution.

24:51.480 --> 24:53.480
[indistinct chatter]

25:02.680 --> 25:04.680
[indistinct shouting]

25:04.760 --> 25:07.480
How are your guests,
the apple-cheeked Danes?

25:07.560 --> 25:11.400
[chuckles] They are eating my food
and drinking my ale.

25:14.360 --> 25:15.720
Have they asked for your sword yet?

25:20.160 --> 25:22.440
They too are saying Alfred is near death,

25:23.720 --> 25:25.920
and that he is preparing his son
for the crown.

25:28.040 --> 25:29.120
True.

25:30.400 --> 25:31.840
His son is a boy

25:32.800 --> 25:34.840
and Alfred is without his commander.

25:34.920 --> 25:37.400
[exhales] Again, true.

25:44.800 --> 25:47.080
Our grandfather would often
speak of Wessex,

25:48.160 --> 25:53.320
about its rich and fertile land
from the Temes to the sea.

25:54.880 --> 25:57.360
-Valhalla in this life.
-[chuckles] Yes.

25:57.440 --> 25:59.800
"Valhalla in this life."
Yes, he said that.

26:02.680 --> 26:04.480
How proud would he be

26:05.360 --> 26:10.000
if together we marched
a great army, and we took that land?

26:18.080 --> 26:21.400
He would be proud, no doubt.

26:23.560 --> 26:24.560
You...

26:26.480 --> 26:28.040
you have made this possible.

26:29.080 --> 26:30.640
By abandoning Alfred...

26:32.320 --> 26:35.560
by leaving Wessex,
you have made this possible.

26:37.040 --> 26:40.240
It is fate, no doubt.

26:50.600 --> 26:52.520
You would kill me, arseling? [echoing]

26:54.280 --> 26:55.600
And men like me?

27:06.760 --> 27:08.960
-Leave us.
-Lord, I cannot.

27:10.600 --> 27:12.440
Brida would have my balls.

27:27.160 --> 27:31.160
You have recovered, Lord. I'm glad.

27:31.720 --> 27:34.440
What is it you want of me? My life?

27:35.760 --> 27:38.320
To be a part of your life, yes.

27:39.200 --> 27:41.320
To live beside you and through you.

27:42.600 --> 27:44.560
You will never be rid of me.

27:45.480 --> 27:46.480
Accept it.

27:48.640 --> 27:49.840
Accept me.

27:53.400 --> 27:55.680
What will become of Wessex and Alfred?

27:56.240 --> 28:00.880
Alfred will die and with him his kingdom,

28:00.960 --> 28:03.200
his god, his people.

28:04.080 --> 28:06.920
Wessex will become just another song.

28:07.480 --> 28:09.520
Danes shall rule.

28:10.800 --> 28:13.840
But you, Uhtred Ragnarson...

28:15.880 --> 28:17.360
For that is who you are now.

28:19.240 --> 28:20.960
...it is you who must rule.

28:21.920 --> 28:25.240
For the sake of the Saxons
you must take Alfred's place.

28:25.320 --> 28:27.360
Only you can unite the two tribes.

28:28.520 --> 28:31.160
What Alfred could only wish for
can be yours.

28:32.640 --> 28:35.280
Ours, My Lord...

28:38.040 --> 28:39.200
My king.

28:42.760 --> 28:45.880
What I want is to be your queen.

28:54.200 --> 28:56.680
And this heart can be yours,
should you want it.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.240
[door opens]

29:04.800 --> 29:06.800
She belongs to me. You will return her.

29:08.440 --> 29:11.400
-You gave her up to save yourself.
-[Bloodhair] She's mine.

29:12.280 --> 29:14.640
If I have to kill you,
then that is what I will do.

29:14.720 --> 29:15.960
Right here.

29:19.480 --> 29:22.800
You are a guest of my brother,
so I will ignore you this once.

29:23.960 --> 29:26.840
But threaten me again
and I'll feed your guts to the pigs.

29:36.280 --> 29:39.280
[Jackdaw] Do nothing, Lord,
or I will take your throat.

29:39.360 --> 29:40.800
No lie.

29:40.880 --> 29:42.000
Skade is mine.

29:43.280 --> 29:45.760
Do nothing. I beg you.

29:47.120 --> 29:48.320
You do not understand.

29:49.480 --> 29:51.120
She's not a woman to own.

29:52.680 --> 29:55.280
It is she that must own a part of you.

29:56.240 --> 29:58.040
Her blood becomes your blood.

30:00.720 --> 30:02.920
We will speak again, I'm certain.

30:08.080 --> 30:09.360
Thank you, Lord.

30:19.320 --> 30:21.080
You are mine to kill.

30:24.360 --> 30:26.360
[indistinct chatter]

30:29.800 --> 30:33.320
Ragnar, I have given you my word
that I would keep the peace,

30:33.920 --> 30:35.600
but I wish to fight Uhtred.

30:36.520 --> 30:38.760
He has taken my woman, my seer.

30:38.840 --> 30:40.960
He shames me. I'd like to slit his belly--

30:41.040 --> 30:43.040
Now is not the time.

30:45.560 --> 30:49.520
I would accept a fight of skill,
with staffs. Skade as the prize.

30:51.200 --> 30:52.480
Bloodhair...

30:54.560 --> 30:55.840
now is not the time.

30:57.200 --> 30:58.560
My answer is no.

31:06.200 --> 31:07.200
[groans in frustration]

31:20.480 --> 31:24.640
[Beocca] I despise every moment
I am upon the waters.

31:24.720 --> 31:27.760
If God intended I travel the seas,
he'd have made me a fish.

31:28.320 --> 31:29.760
Or a Dane.

31:32.080 --> 31:35.400
I pray we are not risking our lives
in this storm for no reason.

31:35.480 --> 31:36.840
This is no storm.

31:39.360 --> 31:41.680
My mother and I
came to this land on a ship

31:41.760 --> 31:44.120
that lost half of its crew to the sea.

31:44.640 --> 31:48.120
Waves taller than a barn
swept them to their death.

31:48.880 --> 31:50.800
This is not a story I wish to hear.

31:52.400 --> 31:55.720
The real storm you will face
will come at Dunholm.

31:55.800 --> 31:57.120
[Beocca groans]

32:09.160 --> 32:10.600
And I will return south

32:10.680 --> 32:13.600
and send Bloodhair's men and ships
to the River Ouse.

32:13.680 --> 32:17.520
You will follow,
and together we attack Mercia,

32:18.200 --> 32:19.920
-we attack Wessex...
-[all agree]

32:20.000 --> 32:23.280
-...and we kill Alfred!
-[all cheering]

32:26.720 --> 32:28.600
I find the pretty Aethelflaed...

32:29.880 --> 32:33.280
-and we all take our turn with her.
-[men laughing]

32:33.360 --> 32:37.400
We count our silver.
We go from north to south,

32:37.480 --> 32:41.600
east to west,
taking everything in our path.

32:41.680 --> 32:44.520
And at some point,
we begin to fight amongst ourselves,

32:44.600 --> 32:46.160
and the plan fails.

32:46.240 --> 32:48.720
Fight? For what reason?

32:49.440 --> 32:50.600
It will happen.

32:50.680 --> 32:53.360
It will surely happen.

32:53.440 --> 32:55.040
Why? Because you say it?

32:55.120 --> 32:57.400
'Cause each of you
believes himself to be the sword Dane

32:57.480 --> 32:59.400
above all others, mistakenly.

33:01.280 --> 33:02.400
There can be only one leader.

33:03.240 --> 33:06.520
I will lead. I have ships, I have men.

33:06.600 --> 33:08.640
I've not grown lazy
sitting inside a fortress--

33:08.720 --> 33:10.480
Are you are calling me lazy?

33:10.560 --> 33:14.120
I am asking you to join me, Ragnar,
as Haesten has joined me.

33:14.200 --> 33:16.480
When did I join you?

33:17.360 --> 33:20.240
I gave you food.
I did not give you my oath.

33:20.320 --> 33:22.400
-You believe you should lead?
-Yes.

33:23.040 --> 33:24.920
-Why not?
-Name your victories.

33:25.000 --> 33:29.240
Says the man who lost half his army
to a sickly king.

33:29.320 --> 33:31.040
That is enough of the shit talk.

33:31.120 --> 33:33.760
-Next, you'll compare cock sizes.
-[men laughing]

33:34.320 --> 33:37.200
-There can only be one leader.
-It must be you, Ragnar.

33:38.760 --> 33:40.280
Why? 'Cause he's your brother?

33:41.480 --> 33:44.280
Because Ragnar's the only man
each of us will trust.

33:46.440 --> 33:47.280
The only man.

33:49.200 --> 33:51.560
You do not trust me, Dane-slayer?

33:51.640 --> 33:53.080
Don't know you or like you.

33:55.800 --> 33:57.880
But you are Ragnar's cousin.

33:58.440 --> 34:01.560
It's not about who leads,
it's about how the wealth is divided.

34:01.640 --> 34:04.480
We do not talk of wealth
until we have it in our hands.

34:05.800 --> 34:08.719
Uhtred says that we must become one army.

34:09.760 --> 34:13.080
I see no man here fool enough to disagree.

34:14.280 --> 34:15.880
You all know of me.

34:16.920 --> 34:19.760
You know of my father and my grandfather.

34:19.840 --> 34:24.040
And I tell you now, I would be proud
to lead the next great army,

34:24.920 --> 34:27.800
but only if it is agreed
by each one of you.

34:28.679 --> 34:31.400
In return for your trust,
I give you my word.

34:31.480 --> 34:34.840
When Alfred is defeated,
and he will be defeated...

34:34.920 --> 34:37.159
-[all agree]
-...there will be silver,

34:38.080 --> 34:39.639
but more than that...

34:41.239 --> 34:45.560
there will be reputation and honor
in this life and the next.

34:47.480 --> 34:50.840
So, who is with me?

34:52.000 --> 34:52.880
Bloodhair?

35:00.360 --> 35:02.680
Yes. I'm with you.

35:04.160 --> 35:06.480
You have my sword. I swear.

35:10.440 --> 35:11.800
Haesten?

35:17.000 --> 35:19.680
I have no argument. I, too, will follow.

35:21.320 --> 35:26.320
And me, cousin, always, but you knew that.

35:26.400 --> 35:27.480
And me.

35:28.640 --> 35:29.560
I'm a man who knows

35:29.640 --> 35:32.520
every Saxon grudge and grievance
held against Alfred.

35:32.600 --> 35:34.120
And there are many.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.320
You will need me.

35:37.240 --> 35:38.720
That leaves Uhtred.

35:43.080 --> 35:45.320
My sword is my brother's, no doubt.

35:49.240 --> 35:50.760
Then it is settled.

35:51.760 --> 35:54.880
The kingdom of Wessex will surrender.

35:54.960 --> 35:57.000
[all cheering]

35:58.560 --> 36:00.080
Or burn!

36:00.880 --> 36:03.000
[all shouting and cheering]

36:13.960 --> 36:15.960
We cannot go against the men of Wessex.

36:16.040 --> 36:18.040
-Be quiet.
-[Osferth] They're our people.

36:18.120 --> 36:20.840
-Finan, our friends.
-Osferth, be quiet.

36:20.920 --> 36:23.120
[shouting and cheering continues]

36:25.960 --> 36:28.160
[shouting indistinctly]

36:29.800 --> 36:31.800
[cheering continues]

36:41.560 --> 36:42.760
Now my sword.

36:49.640 --> 36:51.000
[breathing shakily]

36:56.120 --> 36:57.640
-[man] If you'll allow--
-Leave us now.

36:59.720 --> 37:01.520
My Lady. My Lord.

37:02.800 --> 37:07.040
Lord, why are you doing this to yourself?
There is peace.

37:07.120 --> 37:08.880
There is doubt, my dear.

37:09.800 --> 37:12.000
It is infecting all of our England.

37:12.880 --> 37:15.920
This may yet be a weight
that I must carry.

37:16.560 --> 37:18.440
That I will carry, God help me.

37:20.560 --> 37:21.560
[sniffles]

37:24.200 --> 37:26.920
I must know that I am able. And I am.

37:29.200 --> 37:30.080
I am.

37:31.760 --> 37:33.480
I pray you are wrong...

37:35.720 --> 37:38.280
but I know the sight of you alone

37:38.360 --> 37:42.680
would strike at the heart
of both the doubters and heathen.

37:45.920 --> 37:46.920
Alfred...

37:50.760 --> 37:52.520
you will never leave me.

38:01.240 --> 38:03.160
[wind howling]

38:05.760 --> 38:08.920
[Thyra] Beocca, you have
not spoken a word the whole day.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.240
[Beocca] Yes, I have.

38:12.160 --> 38:14.160
Though my mind is occupied.

38:20.520 --> 38:21.520
Dunholm...

38:22.600 --> 38:24.960
I should not be taking you back
to such a place.

38:27.600 --> 38:30.960
I worry the memories will overwhelm you.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.600
It was a different life, Beocca.

38:34.320 --> 38:35.880
I am a different woman.

38:37.040 --> 38:38.280
I'm with you always.

38:41.040 --> 38:42.000
[Beocca] Riders.

38:42.920 --> 38:44.200
We should hide ourselves.

38:56.640 --> 38:57.760
Haesten.

38:59.040 --> 39:02.800
What is he doing in the north,
such a long way from Beamfleot?

39:03.680 --> 39:06.000
[bell ringing]

39:06.080 --> 39:08.160
-What is it?
-Traders, maybe.

39:12.240 --> 39:14.520
-One man, one woman.
-Unbar the gates.

39:15.080 --> 39:16.440
Let us take a look at them.

39:26.640 --> 39:28.800
A part of me had hoped
he would not be here.

39:37.800 --> 39:38.720
Thyra.

39:40.400 --> 39:42.320
Thyra, what are you doing here?

39:42.400 --> 39:44.120
Are you not glad to see me?

39:47.240 --> 39:50.160
Look at you, you're beautiful.

39:53.320 --> 39:55.600
-And you're smiling.
-[Thyra] I am happy.

39:55.680 --> 39:58.760
What a sight you are.
You have come all this way.

39:59.760 --> 40:01.640
-[Thyra] To see you.
-Who is he here to see?

40:02.520 --> 40:05.200
Brida, I see you've swallowed
yet another wasp.

40:06.080 --> 40:08.680
Beocca insisted on accompanying me.

40:09.240 --> 40:10.760
That is true, in part.

40:11.440 --> 40:13.560
I am also here
to carry out the King's order

40:13.640 --> 40:16.160
and formally banish Uhtred from Wessex.

40:17.160 --> 40:19.360
Such an order is required by law.

40:20.120 --> 40:22.760
When Thyra has grown tired
of her brothers' company,

40:23.440 --> 40:24.720
we shall be gone.

40:24.800 --> 40:27.760
You came all this way
to tell Uhtred what he already knows?

40:27.840 --> 40:31.000
To see the boy one last time.
Kick his arse, perhaps.

40:31.080 --> 40:33.240
-Is it true?
-All of it.

40:33.320 --> 40:34.600
Thyra.

40:36.240 --> 40:37.280
Good to see you.

40:39.160 --> 40:41.800
My children, are they well?
Have you heard?

40:41.880 --> 40:44.320
They are well
and they are being cared for.

40:44.880 --> 40:46.400
I will fetch them soon.

40:48.040 --> 40:49.280
I'll let you rest.

40:52.720 --> 40:54.760
I will speak with the priest later.

40:56.320 --> 40:58.320
[indistinct chatter]

40:59.800 --> 41:02.600
This priest, he is your happiness?

41:03.320 --> 41:04.360
He is.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.840
I could not be without him.

41:08.800 --> 41:09.920
Nor I, you.

41:12.920 --> 41:15.880
We did see the, uh,
charming Earl Haesten on the road.

41:16.440 --> 41:18.600
I know him from his visits to Winchester.

41:19.760 --> 41:21.880
Is he an ally to you,
as well as to Alfred?

41:22.680 --> 41:24.120
Haesten is a Dane.

41:25.480 --> 41:26.440
Indeed.

41:27.320 --> 41:28.200
As is Uhtred.

41:29.480 --> 41:30.680
Father Beocca...

41:32.240 --> 41:33.640
Welcome to Dunholm.

41:36.320 --> 41:38.560
[exhales] Comes as no surprise
to see you here.

41:40.160 --> 41:41.480
Amongst friends.

41:49.600 --> 41:51.600
[indistinct chatter]

42:03.560 --> 42:06.200
-Finan.
-Father Beocca.

42:06.280 --> 42:08.320
-It's good to see you.
-[Beocca] Osferth.

42:09.200 --> 42:12.240
-Dane boy, looks like a rat.
-I am Sihtric.

42:12.320 --> 42:14.840
Your wife, Sihtric, she has left Coccham

42:14.920 --> 42:16.920
and returned to the inn at Winchester.

42:17.720 --> 42:20.320
She has? Is she well?

42:20.400 --> 42:21.600
Oh, she is well.

42:22.640 --> 42:24.320
-And she is loud.
-[chuckles softly]

42:26.240 --> 42:28.960
-[Beocca] Some privacy?
-Sit yourself down, Father.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.240
We all need to piss.

42:40.840 --> 42:42.120
What is all this?

42:42.960 --> 42:44.880
You seem to be preparing for battle.

42:44.960 --> 42:46.120
It is not your concern.

42:46.960 --> 42:49.120
I fear it may become my concern
quite soon.

42:51.400 --> 42:52.400
[sighs]

42:55.160 --> 42:56.760
Give your message and be on your way.

42:58.760 --> 42:59.960
Please, say it.

43:00.040 --> 43:02.680
I am not here to chide you or to save you,

43:03.680 --> 43:05.120
and I'm not here for Alfred.

43:08.480 --> 43:11.720
I'm here for Aethelflaed.
She's in hiding in a nunnery.

43:13.360 --> 43:15.360
-Hiding from who?
-Her husband.

43:15.440 --> 43:17.120
He plans to have her killed.

43:24.120 --> 43:25.680
This is not my worry.

43:27.200 --> 43:29.280
She has guards, she has the King,

43:29.680 --> 43:31.880
-she has Steapa too.
-She's asked for Uhtred.

43:36.560 --> 43:38.360
[breathes deeply]

43:42.800 --> 43:45.320
Did Aethelwold journey here alone?

43:46.560 --> 43:48.480
He arrived with Haesten and Bloodhair.

43:49.040 --> 43:51.520
Having first paid a visit to Aethelred.

43:53.800 --> 43:55.680
Yes. That is what he did.

43:57.880 --> 44:01.480
Am I to assume the plan is to make
Aethelwold the next king of Wessex?

44:04.720 --> 44:06.080
[table thuds]

44:08.480 --> 44:10.000
If Haesten is returning south,

44:10.080 --> 44:12.600
then soon he will know
where Aethelflaed is hiding.

44:12.680 --> 44:16.360
Beocca, I have given
half my life to Wessex.

44:17.880 --> 44:20.960
-I will give no more.
-She says you are sworn to her.

44:22.520 --> 44:25.360
That you promised to help her
should her husband threaten her.

44:25.440 --> 44:28.280
This is a trick. This is Alfred's doing.

44:28.360 --> 44:31.600
Aethelflaed hereby releases you
from that oath.

44:32.640 --> 44:33.840
Yes.

44:35.320 --> 44:38.440
She asks for your help
not because you are her oathman, Uhtred,

44:38.520 --> 44:41.480
but because you are the man
that she trusts the most.

44:42.920 --> 44:44.080
I will say no more.

44:46.200 --> 44:49.320
Had I remained in Wessex
and refused to swear to Edward,

44:50.120 --> 44:53.960
-Alfred would have had me killed.
-It was for Aethelflaed that I came here.

44:54.520 --> 44:56.680
You're free to choose your own path.

44:57.640 --> 44:59.680
May God bless you and guide you.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
[indistinct chatter]

45:27.280 --> 45:28.320
Say nothing.

45:28.400 --> 45:31.480
I won't so much as fart
in your direction, Lord.

45:32.720 --> 45:36.200
I'll simply say to Sihtric here
that this great army

45:36.280 --> 45:39.080
we're supposedly gathering
can never hold.

45:39.160 --> 45:40.200
Agreed.

45:41.200 --> 45:43.640
And I'll mention to Osferth
that I didn't come north

45:43.720 --> 45:46.280
only to turn and march south.

45:46.360 --> 45:47.600
Nor me, Finan.

45:47.680 --> 45:51.000
Lord, I will follow you wherever you go,
but I have a wife in Wessex.

45:52.160 --> 45:55.600
And men like Haesten and Bloodhair
are no better than Kjartan.

45:57.840 --> 46:02.200
If the north is your home,
your birthright,

46:02.280 --> 46:05.080
then why are we not looking
towards Bebbanburg?

46:06.440 --> 46:09.520
Now that is a fight we can believe in.

46:12.640 --> 46:19.360
Uhtred... I am begging you
as your friend, do not do this.

46:19.440 --> 46:20.960
We should leave this place.

46:24.080 --> 46:25.760
And abandon my brother?

46:26.920 --> 46:28.480
How can I do that?

46:30.360 --> 46:31.760
You must.

46:36.240 --> 46:39.920
When Alfred was young,
he would hump anything and everything,

46:40.000 --> 46:41.440
I swear.

46:41.520 --> 46:45.120
He could not help himself.
Or rather, he could,

46:45.200 --> 46:47.640
-and he did.
-[men laughing]

46:49.920 --> 46:50.920
Uhtred.

46:52.480 --> 46:54.120
What did you say to Aethelred?

46:55.360 --> 46:56.840
What? What do you mean?

46:57.400 --> 47:00.360
You went to Aethelred.
What did you speak of?

47:02.480 --> 47:05.400
I spoke of opportunity.

47:06.760 --> 47:07.960
To do what?

47:09.120 --> 47:11.240
To declare himself King of Mercia,

47:11.320 --> 47:13.440
to enrage Alfred, to cause division.

47:13.520 --> 47:15.400
-To help our cause.
-To kill his wife?

47:26.560 --> 47:28.360
Do not sleep tonight.

47:29.480 --> 47:30.880
You may not wake.

47:31.440 --> 47:33.080
Do not sleep any night.

47:40.800 --> 47:42.760
Yes, I may have suggested to Aethelred

47:42.840 --> 47:45.160
that he should kill his wife,
but why ever not?

47:45.920 --> 47:48.400
She is Alfred's daughter,
it'd cause more chaos.

47:48.480 --> 47:50.240
-What does it matter?
-It matters.

47:50.320 --> 47:52.120
[Aethelwold] Why? She is the enemy.

47:53.120 --> 47:56.840
Or did Father Beocca travel all this way
to ask you to go and save her?

47:57.400 --> 48:01.440
After all, it is what you do best.
Rescue princesses.

48:01.520 --> 48:03.760
Ragnar, I ask you to make the square.

48:03.840 --> 48:05.920
I've had enough of him.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
-Then ignore him.
-I will not.

48:08.080 --> 48:10.120
I will fight him right now and kill him.

48:10.200 --> 48:12.680
Why? Because the turd has found the truth?

48:12.760 --> 48:16.720
Uhtred, we are supposed to be one army,
my friend.

48:16.800 --> 48:20.240
I predict the Lord Uhtred
is about to desert this army.

48:23.360 --> 48:26.200
Aethelflaed has called,
and her hound shall go running--

48:26.280 --> 48:28.360
-[grunts]
-[Ragnar] He is not worth it.

48:28.440 --> 48:30.680
[laughing] And there
is the proof if need--

48:30.760 --> 48:34.200
-Proof of what?
-You are torn between Saxon and Dane!

48:34.280 --> 48:38.400
Ragnar, your brother seems conflicted.
Is he with us or not?

48:39.240 --> 48:42.480
Uhtred, what do you say?
How is your answer?

48:45.480 --> 48:46.320
What do you say?

48:50.080 --> 48:52.400
I say this army can never hold.

48:53.480 --> 48:57.440
Ragnar, look around you.
We're enemies, bound only by greed.

48:58.080 --> 49:02.080
-There is no bond, no respect--
-No bond, you say?

49:05.680 --> 49:06.920
Then who am I?

49:08.240 --> 49:09.560
You are my brother.

49:10.240 --> 49:13.920
Is that not bond enough?
Or does it not compare to a princess?

49:14.000 --> 49:15.600
It would appear not.

49:16.920 --> 49:19.840
And you, why are you here?
What is your message?

49:19.920 --> 49:24.080
Ragnar. Ragnar!
Your argument is with me alone.

49:25.200 --> 49:29.360
Uhtred is a free man, Ragnar.
His choices are his own.

49:30.000 --> 49:31.480
Then choose.

49:31.560 --> 49:36.840
Do you stand with us,
with each of us, or not?

49:39.680 --> 49:42.960
You will give your answer, Dane-slayer.
Let us hear you.

49:52.560 --> 49:53.560
[smacks lips]

49:55.080 --> 49:57.600
[breathes deeply]

49:58.680 --> 49:59.800
I will be leaving.

50:02.840 --> 50:06.000
I will be leaving,
though I will not be returning to Wessex.

50:07.560 --> 50:08.920
I am needed.

50:09.000 --> 50:10.520
By a princess.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.120
You're no more a Dane
than the priest here.

50:16.800 --> 50:19.240
You're a whore to the crown of Alfred.

50:21.640 --> 50:23.440
You would do this to me?

50:24.640 --> 50:26.040
Again?

50:27.800 --> 50:30.040
-I must.
-Yes, of course you must.

50:30.120 --> 50:31.240
You swore an oath.

50:33.120 --> 50:35.040
You gave your word.

50:35.600 --> 50:38.040
And that is about reputation and honor.

50:39.120 --> 50:43.080
What my father gave to you,
I now take back.

50:43.160 --> 50:45.480
You are no longer Uhtred Ragnarson.

50:45.560 --> 50:49.240
-Ragnar, you cannot do that, please--
-You are no longer my brother!

50:51.280 --> 50:53.040
This was a game to you.

50:53.120 --> 50:54.280
Never.

50:57.560 --> 51:01.000
Go... before I kill you.

51:03.000 --> 51:06.280
He does not leave with Skade.
Ragnar, she belongs to me.

51:06.360 --> 51:09.360
Yes, Bloodhair. We shall make the square.

51:11.720 --> 51:16.080
And you can fight for the witch...
to the death.

51:18.480 --> 51:21.960
-Agreed.
-Lord, say nothing.

51:25.920 --> 51:26.760
Agreed.

51:29.360 --> 51:30.240
We fight.
