[cell door slams]

01:30.054 --> 01:31.680
[panting]

02:10.301 --> 02:11.846
- Morning, Suzanne.
- Morning.

02:11.929 --> 02:13.764
Hope you have a good writing day.

02:13.848 --> 02:17.018
Hey, lady, that new chapter,
che figata!

02:17.101 --> 02:20.104
I really love how Edwina
outsmarted the orgasmator.

02:20.187 --> 02:22.814
It's like a shout-out to Barbarella,
but still totally new.

02:22.899 --> 02:25.526
- Yeah... meant to do that.
- [sighs]

02:25.609 --> 02:27.987
She has a beautiful mind.

02:28.070 --> 02:30.281
Yeah, sick as fuck, but beautiful.

02:30.364 --> 02:33.242
Is it really possible
to live on nothing but cum?

02:33.325 --> 02:35.661
Only if it's Admiral Rodcocker's cum.

02:35.744 --> 02:40.374
Oh, yeah, you know, and that dude
has some extra protein.

02:40.457 --> 02:42.084
It's gonna be a long day
for you, Rabbi.

02:42.168 --> 02:44.753
Got over 70 inmates
keeping kosher now.

02:44.836 --> 02:46.463
Out of?

02:46.547 --> 02:48.715
- Two hundred-something.
- Wow.

02:48.799 --> 02:49.800
Oy vey.

02:50.634 --> 02:53.845
You brought in a rent-a-rabbi.

02:53.930 --> 02:55.181
Well...

02:55.264 --> 02:58.142
technically, all rabbis are for rent,
if you think about it.

02:58.225 --> 03:00.102
Weddings, bar mitzvahs.

03:00.186 --> 03:02.688
You know, this one just
specializes in corporate inquiry.

03:02.771 --> 03:06.150
Corporate inquiry...
truly God's work.

03:06.233 --> 03:07.318
Everything's cool, buddy.

03:07.401 --> 03:11.155
He's just gonna come in,
sit down with the inmates who eat kosher,

03:11.238 --> 03:14.408
have a little convo...
get to know them.

03:14.491 --> 03:16.910
Test whether
they're Jewish or not.

03:16.994 --> 03:18.204
You're really obsessed with tests.

03:18.287 --> 03:22.959
I'm pretty sure we don't get to
second-guess people's religious beliefs.

03:23.042 --> 03:25.002
Something about the Bill of Rights.

03:25.086 --> 03:26.337
Oh, that old thing.

03:27.879 --> 03:29.548
Kidding, you know.

03:29.631 --> 03:31.133
But also not, you know.

03:31.217 --> 03:35.930
I mean, there is some legal gray area,
and I love me some gray area.

03:36.013 --> 03:39.016
Yeah, you're one giant gray area.

03:39.100 --> 03:41.518
Acting all chummy, all big brother,

03:41.602 --> 03:44.313
but actually, you're...

03:44.396 --> 03:45.481
Big Brother.

03:45.564 --> 03:49.485
You are really stuck on
this hierarchy stuff, Joe.

03:49.568 --> 03:51.653
Someone must have really
done a number on you.

03:51.737 --> 03:53.697
Yeah, she sure did.

03:53.780 --> 03:56.617
You're okay now, buddy.
You're on the MCC team.

03:56.700 --> 03:59.495
I'm gonna be watching out for you.

03:59.578 --> 04:00.912
We'll all be watching.

04:00.997 --> 04:03.332
That's what Big Brother says.

04:13.217 --> 04:14.343
[inhales shakily]

04:16.845 --> 04:18.096
[sobs]

04:19.930 --> 04:21.100
[sniffles]

04:21.767 --> 04:24.728
Fuck, Norma.
How do you do that?

04:24.811 --> 04:26.605
She always makes me cry, too.

04:26.688 --> 04:28.524
It's a miracle.

04:33.070 --> 04:35.864
Damn, there ain't
enough Norma to go around.

04:35.947 --> 04:38.617
Hey, Club Waco, beat it.

04:38.700 --> 04:41.620
Yeah, I'll handle this.
Thank you.

04:41.703 --> 04:43.080
The Charismatic Catholics

04:43.164 --> 04:46.083
need an extra half hour this morning
to learn a new hymn,

04:46.167 --> 04:47.668
so if you could just move along...

04:47.751 --> 04:49.461
I don't know sign language.

04:49.545 --> 04:52.756
She's saying we signed up.
We got a right to be here.

04:53.840 --> 04:57.511
I'm sorry, I'm not clear on
what religion you're all practicing.

04:57.594 --> 05:01.348
It's a new faith,
but we don't have a name yet.

05:01.432 --> 05:02.974
Christians were new once, too.

05:03.059 --> 05:05.686
And after hundreds of years
of private worship,

05:05.769 --> 05:06.978
several great schisms,

05:07.063 --> 05:08.897
and thousands of people
martyring themselves,

05:08.980 --> 05:12.193
it became a focused belief system...

05:12.276 --> 05:13.444
with a name.

05:13.527 --> 05:14.903
[Leanne] Hey!

05:16.613 --> 05:18.657
We got a belief system.

05:20.576 --> 05:22.703
We believe in kindness and acceptance.

05:24.246 --> 05:25.581
And...

05:26.290 --> 05:27.458
finding the peace within

05:27.541 --> 05:31.670
that can then radiate out
into the world and create change.

05:31.753 --> 05:33.172
And through silent meditation,

05:33.255 --> 05:37.050
we address the roar
of pain and loneliness and tame it.

05:38.051 --> 05:41.638
And through reflection,
we can see nothingness...

05:41.722 --> 05:45.684
and in nothingness,
we find clarity... we have faith.

05:49.980 --> 05:51.064
In what...

05:51.565 --> 05:53.484
Her?

05:53.567 --> 05:57.654
There's no body of the principles.
They're too big to be contained.

05:57.738 --> 05:59.448
So, you're atheists.

05:59.531 --> 06:00.866
I ain't no fucking...

06:05.162 --> 06:07.706
I don't think you're ready to understand.

06:07.789 --> 06:10.709
Look, sitting around meditating
doesn't make you a religion.

06:10.792 --> 06:12.669
It makes you a meditation club.

06:12.753 --> 06:15.922
Ooh. "Meditation Club."
that's not a bad name for us.

06:16.006 --> 06:19.301
Okay, this one needs
to be our first martyr.

06:19.385 --> 06:22.221
[Zeke] Look at this fucking thing.
It's like a giant mouth.

06:22.304 --> 06:23.805
It's opening, it's closing.

06:23.889 --> 06:27.768
- You're fucked up, Zeke.
- Yeah, no shit, Nancy Drew.

06:27.851 --> 06:29.770
I think it's, "No shit, Sherlock."

06:29.853 --> 06:34.024
Sherlock shits by the seashore.

06:34.107 --> 06:35.151
The plastic's kinda melty.

06:35.234 --> 06:38.612
Peanut butter cups and meth,
it's like Red Vines and Dr. Pepper.

06:38.695 --> 06:41.573
This is the fucking life.

06:41.657 --> 06:44.993
I don't know why anyone ever goes back.
All those rules.

06:45.076 --> 06:48.372
I feel bad for the ones that
don't even know that this is here.

06:48.455 --> 06:52.334
They think that's reality,
but this is the real reality.

06:52.418 --> 06:54.420
Real reality.

06:54.503 --> 06:55.796
Real-eality.

06:55.879 --> 06:57.839
Plus, those fucking beards.

06:57.923 --> 07:01.051
- Hey, give me a bag.
- 20 bucks.

07:01.135 --> 07:04.221
- I got 15.
- That's nice.

07:04.305 --> 07:07.308
Hey, White Trash Federline,
tell your girl to be more polite.

07:07.391 --> 07:09.476
- I'm a frequent flier.
- Fuck off, Sam.

07:10.977 --> 07:13.439
Federline is White Trash Federline,
you fucktard!

07:13.522 --> 07:14.648
[laughs]

07:21.530 --> 07:24.158
- It kind of looks like a mouth.
- Totally.

07:24.241 --> 07:26.410
Like, the flames are the teeth.

07:26.493 --> 07:29.288
And the black part there,
that's the door.

07:29.371 --> 07:31.915
- A door to where?
- Hell, I guess.

07:31.998 --> 07:33.375
Isn't that where we're all going?

07:34.710 --> 07:39.673
Hey, everybody!
I just put a roofie in my own drink.

09:13.767 --> 09:15.686
[speaking Pennsylvania Dutch]
Mother, I'm back.

09:19.064 --> 09:20.065
[exhales]

09:26.738 --> 09:28.239
Gloria!

09:30.075 --> 09:31.535
Grab a knife.

09:31.618 --> 09:33.954
It's almost time to
milk the shit sacks.

09:34.037 --> 09:35.956
Terrific.

09:36.039 --> 09:40.336
Beautiful card I have for you.
A beauty, a doll.

09:40.419 --> 09:42.128
[clicks tongue]
You're welcome.

09:42.754 --> 09:44.756
- I don't need it.
- I thought you'd need that.

09:44.840 --> 09:45.841
[Blanca] Mmm-mmm.

09:46.842 --> 09:49.260
[Sophia] Gloria. Gloria Mendoza.

09:49.886 --> 09:52.389
I'm sorry,
but I'm done for real this time.

09:52.473 --> 09:53.515
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:53.599 --> 09:55.517
- I thought you and I were cool.
- We are not cool.

09:55.601 --> 09:58.854
Michael was arrested.
He spent the night in holding.

09:58.937 --> 10:01.022
What? What happened?

10:01.106 --> 10:04.150
He and your son
beat the crap out of some kid.

10:04.234 --> 10:05.611
The boy might lose an eye.

10:05.694 --> 10:08.989
- Was Benny arrested, too?
- I don't know.

10:09.072 --> 10:10.407
But I raised a sweet little boy,

10:10.491 --> 10:13.369
who cried when he found out
there was no Easter Bunny.

10:13.452 --> 10:16.121
And now suddenly, he's a thug.

10:16.204 --> 10:18.123
You saying this is on my boy?

10:18.206 --> 10:21.167
I'm saying he can find
his own ride from now on.

10:22.461 --> 10:24.045
I knew I was right.

10:24.129 --> 10:27.007
Hmm, why I always gotta
have these conversations

10:27.090 --> 10:29.635
with sharp objects in my hand?

10:29.718 --> 10:31.219
You need to get out of here,

10:31.302 --> 10:33.263
before you add another
100 years to my sentence.

10:33.347 --> 10:37.267
[chuckles] So, you gonna cut me, huh?

10:37.351 --> 10:38.852
I wonder where Benny gets it.

10:38.935 --> 10:40.145
Oh, man, you know what?

10:40.228 --> 10:43.565
Your son is fucking 15 years old,
and there is no fucking Easter Bunny.

10:43.649 --> 10:46.568
And if you think that my son
killed the fake-ass rabbit,

10:46.652 --> 10:48.779
then you're living in a fucking fantasy.

10:48.862 --> 10:50.406
Who needs a knife?

10:50.489 --> 10:53.074
She'll die from eating today's lunch.

10:53.158 --> 10:54.785
[Blanca speaking Spanish]

10:54.868 --> 10:55.911
Gin.

10:55.994 --> 10:57.913
[speaking Russian]

10:58.497 --> 11:00.541
[Coates] Looks like a nice one.

11:00.624 --> 11:01.958
Huh?

11:02.042 --> 11:03.794
The sun's coming out, I mean.

11:03.877 --> 11:07.130
And I got a shitload of red velvets
back at the shop about to go stale.

11:07.213 --> 11:08.715
Oh, yeah? So what?

11:08.799 --> 11:10.008
I know, I know.

11:10.091 --> 11:12.093
A lot of red velvet haters
out there all of a sudden.

11:12.177 --> 11:14.971
Some serious backlash.

11:15.055 --> 11:18.975
But I know some hungry ducks
who might enjoy 'em.

11:19.851 --> 11:21.853
One hungry duck in particular.

11:23.980 --> 11:26.858
- I mean you.
- Yeah, I got it.

11:26.942 --> 11:28.151
I got it.

11:29.402 --> 11:31.404
- What's up your ass?
- Nothing.

11:32.322 --> 11:33.907
Nothing whatsoever, Officer Coates.

11:33.990 --> 11:37.911
I'm just standing here, doing my job,
being a professional prisoner.

11:38.537 --> 11:42.458
So, I suggest you do your job
and guard me professional-like.

11:45.836 --> 11:46.920
[exhales into hand]

11:47.003 --> 11:48.338
[man speaking indistinctly
on walkie-talkie]

11:49.840 --> 11:52.425
- Yo, what'd I miss?
- Yo, they're saying Judy's going down.

11:52.509 --> 11:54.094
[Taystee] Yeah, she is.

11:54.177 --> 11:57.055
I've heard that
she steals her recipes.

11:57.138 --> 11:59.140
I've heard she has
a husband and a lover,

11:59.224 --> 12:01.309
and they all live
in the same house.

12:01.392 --> 12:02.769
[gasps] She cheats on Bill?

12:02.853 --> 12:05.230
Well, is it cheating
if they all live together?

12:05.313 --> 12:07.899
Wait, do they all sleep in the same bed?
Like, the three of them?

12:07.983 --> 12:09.150
See, I don't believe it.

12:09.234 --> 12:11.737
If that lady were getting it
on the regular with two dudes,

12:11.820 --> 12:14.948
she would not be
sweating a rosemary garnish.

12:15.031 --> 12:16.324
- [chuckles]
- You never know.

12:16.407 --> 12:18.368
Yo, right on time!

12:19.285 --> 12:21.580
Um, actually, I'm here for them.

12:22.956 --> 12:25.626
First, she joins the Church o' Crazy Eyes,
now this?

12:25.709 --> 12:27.418
Whatever makes her happy.

12:27.503 --> 12:28.504
- God bless.
- Mmm.

12:28.587 --> 12:30.088
Or Norma bless, I guess.

12:30.171 --> 12:32.215
[Leanne] So, as I was saying...

12:32.298 --> 12:34.217
we need to come up with
a list of commandments

12:34.300 --> 12:35.552
so that they know we're for real.

12:35.636 --> 12:38.054
Thou shalt not snort
thy neighbor's heroin.

12:38.138 --> 12:40.181
"Covet."
It's "covet."

12:40.265 --> 12:42.559
You can do what you want with it.
I'm gonna snort it.

12:42.643 --> 12:45.270
I'm serious, you guys.
We need to set the rules.

12:45.353 --> 12:47.731
[Brook] For me, it's less about,
like, rules,

12:47.814 --> 12:49.900
and more what happens
when I look at Norma.

12:49.983 --> 12:51.527
Oh, yeah, what's that about?

12:51.610 --> 12:53.987
I mean, it's, um... it's, like,
less than magic,

12:54.070 --> 12:55.446
but more than a hug.

12:55.531 --> 12:57.240
[Brook] The way I see it...

12:58.033 --> 13:00.827
it's the armor you put on every day.

13:00.911 --> 13:03.038
The armor that...

13:03.121 --> 13:06.416
that it takes to get through every day.

13:07.959 --> 13:12.088
It gets heavier and heavier
as you live your life, you know?

13:12.172 --> 13:14.424
Especially in here.

13:15.258 --> 13:16.843
But when you look at Norma...

13:17.969 --> 13:20.055
you can take that armor off...

13:21.431 --> 13:23.391
because it's safe.

13:24.560 --> 13:26.394
You're safe.

13:26.477 --> 13:29.981
And... you're crying...

13:30.065 --> 13:34.695
because it feels... so good
to take that armor off.

13:36.446 --> 13:39.324
And you realize
how tall you can be without it...

13:40.826 --> 13:42.160
how light.

13:43.453 --> 13:46.206
Yeah... yeah, what she said.

13:46.289 --> 13:50.460
I mean, maybe what's so special
about this... whatever...

13:51.628 --> 13:54.923
is that there aren't any rules...

13:55.006 --> 13:56.007
- Yeah.
- You know?

13:56.091 --> 13:58.551
I've always had trouble with
organized religion, anyway.

13:58.635 --> 14:02.055
And honestly, I think the more
this becomes a capital "R" religion,

14:02.138 --> 14:03.974
the less time
we seem to get with Norma.

14:04.057 --> 14:06.267
Yeah, and we're all here
to be with Norma, right?

14:06.351 --> 14:08.436
That's fine, but we still
need to deal with

14:08.519 --> 14:10.564
the rest of the world
and how they see us.

14:10.647 --> 14:13.233
And when you come in late
and you call it a fucking club,

14:13.316 --> 14:15.736
you make us all look like a joke.

14:15.819 --> 14:18.488
We need to know who we are,
or they'll think we're a joke.

14:19.114 --> 14:21.407
I know who I am.

14:21.491 --> 14:23.451
I'm someone who's sometimes late.

14:23.534 --> 14:27.873
Look, Soso, I know not committing
is, like, your thing.

14:27.956 --> 14:31.918
You couldn't commit to saving the world.
You couldn't commit to eating pussy.

14:32.002 --> 14:34.004
You couldn't even commit
to being 100% Asian.

14:34.087 --> 14:37.674
So, why don't you go off
and not commit somewhere else?

14:37.758 --> 14:40.051
Nobody wants you here, anyways.

14:44.598 --> 14:47.308
Okay, y'all are
illegally congregating here.

14:47.392 --> 14:48.977
This ain't the meeting house.

14:49.060 --> 14:52.313
And for a gang who likes quiet time,
y'all are hella noisy.

14:52.397 --> 14:55.483
So, either get out,
or I'm calling the po-pos.

14:55.566 --> 14:57.485
[whispering] This is Judy time.

14:57.568 --> 14:59.195
[Janae] Turn that shit up.

15:00.196 --> 15:02.991
That's right, P.
Come to the light.

15:03.074 --> 15:04.743
I deeply regret

15:04.826 --> 15:07.996
some of the financial choices
I have made in the recent past.

15:08.079 --> 15:11.082
I was not fully aware of the decisions
that my advisers were...

15:11.166 --> 15:14.460
- Is it cool if I stay and watch, too?
- Get your ass up, now!

15:14.544 --> 15:15.629
I couldn't stand the heat,

15:15.712 --> 15:18.089
but I'm afraid I didn't
get out of the kitchen in time

15:18.173 --> 15:22.218
to recognize the misappropriation
that was taking place.

15:22.302 --> 15:24.012
I guess I had my head in the oven.

15:24.095 --> 15:27.683
Uh, well, no... Um...
Maybe that was a poor choice.

15:27.766 --> 15:29.935
We're getting kicked out of everywhere.
We need to get legit.

15:30.018 --> 15:32.562
There was a vein in your neck
that was like... [roars]

15:32.646 --> 15:34.439
It was rad.

15:34.522 --> 15:36.607
Yeah, but weren't you
kind of hard on hippie chick?

15:36.692 --> 15:38.193
Some people aren't cut out for believing.

15:39.402 --> 15:42.488
[speaking Pennsylvania Dutch]
I baptize you, my sister,

15:42.572 --> 15:45.491
Leanne Lemmle Taylor,

15:46.743 --> 15:49.996
in the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

15:50.080 --> 15:54.751
You must strengthen the church
and not tear it down.

15:54.835 --> 15:58.129
Be strong against the world's ways.

16:11.351 --> 16:13.561
[speaking English] If it's all right,
can I say a few quick words?

16:16.773 --> 16:17.983
And I mean quick.

16:18.066 --> 16:20.443
I know today is about
way more than me.

16:21.778 --> 16:24.280
I only wanted to say
I'm glad that, as Amish,

16:24.364 --> 16:26.825
we get to choose our baptism.

16:27.868 --> 16:30.120
I didn't know what I wanted
until a couple of months ago,

16:30.203 --> 16:34.207
and I wanna thank my parents
for having me back with open arms.

16:37.210 --> 16:40.296
I had a good time in the English world,
I'm not gonna lie.

16:40.380 --> 16:43.383
- I mean, who doesn't like zippers, right?
- [scattered laughter]

16:43.466 --> 16:45.719
[speaking Pennsylvania Dutch]
Wrap it up, Leanne.

16:45.802 --> 16:48.638
[speaking English]
Sorry, Dad. Anyway...

16:50.473 --> 16:53.601
it was fun for a while,
but the fun just started to seem like

16:53.684 --> 16:56.187
everyone was covering up
the empty feelings.

16:57.731 --> 17:00.942
[speaking Pennsylvania Dutch]
They talk about us like we're in prison.

17:02.068 --> 17:05.155
But this is where I feel free.

17:12.703 --> 17:16.916
Sorry I have a big mouth.

17:17.000 --> 17:22.505
Don't be sorry. I'd rather have you
than a hundred quiet girls.

17:22.588 --> 17:24.674
[female police detective]
Leanne Taylor?

17:33.558 --> 17:36.436
[Black Cindy] Damn, Suzanne.
Didn't you get the memo?

17:36.519 --> 17:39.105
We chosen now.
We ain't got to eat that shit.

17:39.189 --> 17:40.315
It's chicken fajitas.

17:40.398 --> 17:43.777
See, that's how they get you,
with the power of suggestion.

17:43.860 --> 17:45.486
- Mmm-hmm.
- Like, now they be calling yogurt

17:45.570 --> 17:48.489
"key lime pie" or
"chocolate cheesecake."

17:48.573 --> 17:51.076
So, you think, "Hmm, cheesecake,"

17:51.159 --> 17:53.829
when it's the same gnarly curds
it always was.

17:53.912 --> 17:54.996
[singsong voice] Wow.

17:55.080 --> 17:57.874
I want you all to know I had
nothing to do with what you're eating.

17:57.958 --> 17:59.793
It came out of a bag.

17:59.876 --> 18:02.670
It is in no way
a reflection of what I do.

18:02.753 --> 18:04.464
- Okay.
- Okay.

18:05.756 --> 18:08.718
See, even she ain't owning it.

18:08.802 --> 18:12.055
Hey, Suzanne.
How's that new chapter coming?

18:12.138 --> 18:15.516
Here, have my strawberry Jell-O.
Fruit is brain food.

18:15.600 --> 18:16.684
Thanks.

18:16.767 --> 18:20.063
- Is, uh, this seat taken?
- Yeah, we saving it for Elijah.

18:20.146 --> 18:21.689
Man, you gonna own that rabbi.

18:21.772 --> 18:24.234
Suzanne, tell us about your process.

18:25.401 --> 18:27.737
I think of shit and write it down.

18:27.821 --> 18:29.823
- Wow.
- So pure.

18:30.573 --> 18:32.700
I got a question.

18:32.783 --> 18:36.746
If Edwina is really
a robo-doll in the end...

18:37.747 --> 18:41.792
why doesn't she get rusty
when Lily Sprinkle pees on her?

18:41.877 --> 18:44.004
She's made of pee-proof metal.

18:44.087 --> 18:47.048
Why does Sunflower
have to be so mean?

18:47.132 --> 18:49.800
Oh, 'cause she's the one
you love to hate.

18:49.885 --> 18:52.303
You should have her
time hump with Lily Sprinkle.

18:52.387 --> 18:53.972
[Annie] Yeah.
[Maureen] Do it for the lesbians.

18:54.055 --> 18:55.806
Sounds like she's done
enough for the lesbians.

18:55.891 --> 18:58.184
What has she done
for not-the-lesbians?

18:58.268 --> 19:00.436
[Babs] Um, only the best chapter.

19:00.520 --> 19:01.521
Which one?

19:01.604 --> 19:04.565
When Admiral Rodcocker
gets his clothes vaporized

19:04.649 --> 19:06.943
and you find out he gots two penises.

19:07.027 --> 19:08.111
Oh, yeah.

19:08.194 --> 19:11.281
And he gives her a shocker
made of penis instead of fingers.

19:11.364 --> 19:12.532
I mean, who thinks of that?

19:12.615 --> 19:14.409
- Damn, I gotta read that shit.
- [clicks tongue]

19:14.492 --> 19:15.826
- What?
- That's it!

19:15.911 --> 19:18.663
This... this book tour is over.

19:18.746 --> 19:20.540
I can do one last question.

19:21.499 --> 19:23.418
Did you have an inspiration
for Admiral Rodcocker?

19:27.005 --> 19:29.549
- [Crazy Eyes clicks tongue]
- [gasps] I knew it.

19:29.632 --> 19:31.342
- [Frieda scoffs]
- [gasps]

19:31.426 --> 19:34.845
I never thought I'd have a thing
for bald dudes, but damn.

19:34.930 --> 19:36.139
[laughs]

19:36.222 --> 19:38.308
The fuck kind of multi-culti shit
we got going on here?

19:38.391 --> 19:40.226
Can't a black woman
sit with her peoples?

19:40.310 --> 19:45.065
No, see, the universiality of my work
unites all the races.

19:47.567 --> 19:48.609
[groaning]

19:48.693 --> 19:52.780
I was hoping for those little
stale pieces of bread today.

19:52.863 --> 19:54.699
No such luck.

19:57.077 --> 19:58.119
Hey, Whitehill.

19:59.537 --> 20:02.623
You wanna have lunch with
our sad little band of misfits?

20:03.333 --> 20:04.375
Sure.

20:05.626 --> 20:06.669
Sure.

20:08.504 --> 20:09.839
Sure.

20:10.840 --> 20:14.885
Everybody, this is Lolly.
Lolly, everybody.

20:14.970 --> 20:19.933
- You're new?
- Litchfield newbie, prison regular.

20:20.016 --> 20:22.518
Don't worry, it's not so bad.

20:22.602 --> 20:25.188
Not so bad?
This place is the best!

20:25.271 --> 20:26.940
How is it?

20:27.023 --> 20:30.026
- Oh, that tastes like brown.
- [groans]

20:30.110 --> 20:34.489
FYI, ladies, I didn't make the food.
This is all out of my control.

20:34.572 --> 20:37.408
Yes, thank you, Red.
You're making that very clear.

20:37.492 --> 20:40.411
- Good, as long as you understand.
- Mmm.

20:42.538 --> 20:47.002
So... what's your deal, Lolly?
What are you in for?

20:47.085 --> 20:51.256
- I did something I shouldn't have.
- Okay, specific.

20:51.339 --> 20:52.757
Where are you from?

20:53.258 --> 20:54.509
Here and there.

20:54.592 --> 20:56.219
- [Lorna] How much time you got?
- Depends.

20:56.302 --> 20:58.179
Depends?

20:58.263 --> 21:00.348
On how well I do here.

21:02.475 --> 21:07.355
Well, try and think of
your time here as a mandala.

21:08.356 --> 21:13.569
The Tibetan monks make intricate designs
out of dyed sand,

21:13.653 --> 21:17.073
and when they're done... whoosh...

21:17.157 --> 21:18.699
they're cleared away.

21:21.161 --> 21:23.163
I gotta go take a quiz.

21:23.246 --> 21:25.040
A quiz?

21:26.874 --> 21:30.920
- Okay, bye. What the fuck?
- What a twat.

21:31.004 --> 21:33.006
She is nutty as a nut bar.

21:33.089 --> 21:35.508
It makes me glad I got
both my feet on the ground.

21:35.591 --> 21:37.177
[scoffs]

21:37.260 --> 21:39.887
- I mean, I tried, right?
- Yeah.

21:39.970 --> 21:41.556
Tell Piper I play well with others.

21:41.639 --> 21:42.890
Tell Piper what?

21:42.973 --> 21:46.769
Oh, nothing, schnookums.
Just facing my fears head-on.

21:46.852 --> 21:48.771
Did you just call me
"schnookums"?

21:48.854 --> 21:50.523
I did, but it was
in between quotes.

21:50.606 --> 21:53.068
I didn't hear any quotes,
love muffin.

21:53.776 --> 21:55.278
Now you're just being smutty.

21:55.361 --> 21:58.239
Cal's coming tomorrow to give us
the lowdown on our first shipment.

21:58.323 --> 22:00.700
- I'm pretty excited.
- That's great.

22:06.497 --> 22:09.292
Also, I killed a guard
with my bare hands.

22:10.585 --> 22:13.045
Cal... Panties... Exciting.

22:15.881 --> 22:18.176
My bats mitzvah was sick!

22:18.259 --> 22:20.553
All the black Jews was there.

22:20.636 --> 22:22.388
Lenny Kravitz...

22:24.182 --> 22:26.016
[speaking gibberish]

22:32.148 --> 22:36.068
For a long time,
"kosher" meant hot dogs to me.

22:36.152 --> 22:37.695
Really, really good hot dogs.

22:37.778 --> 22:41.574
But now,
it just means so much more.

22:41.657 --> 22:46.036
Now, it means broccoli...
green beans.

22:46.121 --> 22:48.206
You know what I hate?

22:48.289 --> 22:50.082
Shrimps.

22:50.166 --> 22:52.084
Damn, dirty shrimps.

22:52.168 --> 22:54.295
Don't even talk to me
about shrimps!

22:54.379 --> 22:57.173
I call my mother a lot,
like, every day.

22:57.257 --> 22:59.259
And I love a bargain.

22:59.342 --> 23:01.386
"Who hath believed our report...

23:01.469 --> 23:04.430
and to whom is
the arm of the Lord revealed?"

23:04.514 --> 23:06.141
Isaiah 53, verse one.

23:06.224 --> 23:07.767
[speaking gibberish]

23:09.935 --> 23:11.687
[singing]

23:14.815 --> 23:16.359
[mumbling]

23:17.652 --> 23:20.780
Latinas are halfway Jew already.

23:20.863 --> 23:22.948
I mean, the hora
and the conga line?

23:23.032 --> 23:25.034
Basically the same thing.

23:25.117 --> 23:29.914
There was a big book where I wrote down
all the people I wish was dead...

23:29.997 --> 23:32.417
who...

23:32.500 --> 23:37.463
You know, so God comes and kills them
and not my... me.

23:37.547 --> 23:38.548
And may I say,

23:38.631 --> 23:43.719
I think y'all are doing a wonderful job
controlling the media.

23:43.803 --> 23:46.639
I mean, we...
we are doing a wonderful job.

23:48.140 --> 23:50.976
[Rabbi Tatelbaum] Now, Miss Hayes,
were you raised Jewish?

23:51.060 --> 23:54.272
Mmm-hmm.
Born and bred, on my mama's side.

23:54.355 --> 23:57.358
And that's the side
that make it all legit, see?

23:57.442 --> 23:58.818
Jewish smarts.

23:58.901 --> 24:01.028
- And you kept kosher growing up?
- Mmm-hmm.

24:01.111 --> 24:02.863
Let me lay it all out for you.

24:02.947 --> 24:03.989
The whole brood of Hayes,

24:04.073 --> 24:06.826
we lived under the Cyclone
on Coney Island, right?

24:06.909 --> 24:08.661
Brooklyn in the house. A-yo!

24:09.329 --> 24:11.747
And, uh, oh, I was always
a nervous kid growing up,

24:11.831 --> 24:15.125
always worrying about
the universe expanding,

24:15.210 --> 24:17.462
and... and so, my parents
took me to a shrink,

24:17.545 --> 24:21.341
and the shrink was like,
"Cindy, quit your worrying.

24:21.424 --> 24:24.093
The universe be chilling
for another billion years."

24:24.176 --> 24:26.637
But I couldn't stop worrying
and cooking lobsters

24:26.721 --> 24:29.224
and hanging with women
in suspenders.

24:29.307 --> 24:31.267
I see you're familiar with Annie Hall.

24:31.351 --> 24:33.769
- Annie who?
- I see.

24:35.771 --> 24:38.649
Okay, okay, okay.
Anyway... anyway...

24:38.733 --> 24:41.486
So, my father...

24:41.569 --> 24:43.821
my father died pretty young.

24:43.904 --> 24:45.072
It was a sad story.

24:45.155 --> 24:47.700
And after he died,
I went to yeshiva school.

24:47.783 --> 24:49.619
Now, I knew I had to
dress like a dude and all,

24:49.702 --> 24:53.248
but that didn't matter, 'cause what
I really wanted to study was the, um...

24:53.331 --> 24:55.416
What's that word that begin with a "T"?

24:55.500 --> 24:56.626
- The Talmud.
- Next.

24:56.709 --> 24:58.336
- The Torah.
- Mmm, yeah, that.

24:58.419 --> 24:59.879
And whenever I felt alone,

24:59.962 --> 25:02.131
I would sing up to
my papa in heaven,

25:02.214 --> 25:05.885
and I would be like,
"Papa... do you feel me?"

25:07.094 --> 25:10.139
And he would be like, "Cindy, girl...

25:10.222 --> 25:14.852
even though I'm in heaven,
I still feel you."

25:14.935 --> 25:18.606
Jews don't have an official
conception of the afterlife.

25:20.065 --> 25:21.442
Oh.

25:21.526 --> 25:23.403
I remember that now.

25:23.486 --> 25:26.864
The focus, instead, is to fulfill
our duties to God here on Earth.

25:26.947 --> 25:29.825
Right! That's how we do it.

25:29.909 --> 25:32.912
[chuckles] Miss Hayes,
while I am heartened

25:32.995 --> 25:36.206
that you appreciate the works
of Woody Allen and Barbra Streisand,

25:36.291 --> 25:41.211
I think you've confused cultural Judaism
with committed Jewish belief.

25:41.296 --> 25:44.465
Also, I hear Mandy Patinkin
can be difficult to work with.

25:45.758 --> 25:47.552
So, do I pass?

25:49.720 --> 25:52.264

Can't somebody else drive him?

Who does this tranny bitch think she is,
messing with your visitations?

26:07.822 --> 26:10.074
Tranny's got nothing to do with it.

26:10.157 --> 26:12.660
It's just two mothers
going at it for their kids.

26:12.743 --> 26:15.413
So, maybe it's better for Benny
if I don't win this one.

26:15.496 --> 26:17.247
You're not thinking of apologizing?

26:17.332 --> 26:19.750

being able to see your kid, mama.

26:22.294 --> 26:23.796
She should apologize to you.

Benny's a mouthy little fucker.
What if he did start this?

Even if Benny was
a bad influence,

26:29.927 --> 26:32.680

her kid's fucked in the head?

26:32.763 --> 26:35.224

One of them got a pee-pee.

26:46.569 --> 26:48.446
[both] We know.

26:48.529 --> 26:51.281
As I was saying, we gotta
think of this as the first test,

26:51.366 --> 26:53.242
like the Jews wandering the desert,

26:53.325 --> 26:54.994
or the early Christians,
wherever they wandered.

26:55.077 --> 26:56.286
The desert, I think.

26:56.371 --> 26:58.748
Everybody was
in the desert for a while.

27:06.130 --> 27:08.966
And for the record,
your timing sucks.

27:09.049 --> 27:12.177
That Rodcocker just
fell into the orgasmator.

27:12.261 --> 27:13.513
Hey, no spoilers.

27:13.596 --> 27:16.306
I gotta hand this over
to Valdez in 30 minutes.

27:16.391 --> 27:19.268
The world's gonna keep shitting on us
until we make ourselves official.

27:19.351 --> 27:22.062
- Official how?
- Maybe if we all got the same haircut.

27:22.146 --> 27:24.440
Only if all y'all get my haircut.

27:24.524 --> 27:27.902
No, or something with our clothes,
like an armband with a symbol.

27:27.985 --> 27:29.111
Like a swastika?

27:29.654 --> 27:31.697
Not an armband,
but something else that...

27:31.781 --> 27:35.576
Something else for excluding people,
like how you excluded Brook.

27:36.494 --> 27:37.995
Soso left on her own.

27:38.078 --> 27:42.041
Yeah, after you scared her away with
your rules and regulations and loudness.

They're gonna wonder why I'm back.

- Amish kids come back all the time.
- Not once they're baptized.

They don't have to know
you're baptized.

They think not wearing buttons
makes them closer to God.

28:18.243 --> 28:20.455

is hang out for a couple hours,

limited your choices

lying around with your ID in it.

28:36.261 --> 28:38.347
I'd say you're getting
a pretty sweet deal.

this one small thing,

I missed it too much here.

37:32.047 --> 37:34.091
worked the whole
Black-Jewish mafia thing.

37:34.174 --> 37:35.884
But I guess
he ain't never heard of Drake.

37:35.968 --> 37:38.387
Well, fool, you're, like,
fifty shades darker than Drake.

37:38.470 --> 37:39.846
Fifty Shades of Drake.

37:39.929 --> 37:40.930
- [laughs]
- Mmm.

37:41.015 --> 37:42.975
- Yeah.
- That's right, girl.

37:43.058 --> 37:44.977
Somebody must've passed that test.

37:45.060 --> 37:47.104
[Maritza] One kosher meal coming right up.

37:49.731 --> 37:52.734
The Abrahamic religions
are pretty much all the same,

37:52.817 --> 37:55.362
- till you get to Jesus.
- [Black Cindy scoffs]

37:55.445 --> 37:57.739
Yo, Red, you eat this shit?

37:59.866 --> 38:02.619
People of the cafeteria,
in case you haven't heard,

38:02.702 --> 38:05.247
I didn't cook it.

38:05.330 --> 38:07.457
I punch in, I punch out.

38:07.541 --> 38:09.834
I play Sudoku, I scratch my ass.

38:09.918 --> 38:11.795
If I had e-mail, I would check it.

38:11.878 --> 38:16.716
But the food you eat does not have
even a piece of my soul in it.

38:16.800 --> 38:17.842
That is all.

38:21.263 --> 38:24.641
- Only one thing left to do now.
- What's that?

38:24.724 --> 38:26.143
Convert for real.

38:26.226 --> 38:28.270
Where my dreidel at?

38:33.150 --> 38:34.693
Writer's block?

38:35.610 --> 38:39.073
It's like I can see the words,
but I can't make them obey me.

38:39.156 --> 38:42.409
That's okay. Fran Lebowitz
hasn't written anything for 30 years,

38:42.492 --> 38:43.993
and people still think she's great.

38:44.078 --> 38:47.039
- Yeah, as great as Gena Showalter?
- I don't know who that is.

38:47.122 --> 38:48.415
Hey, I was wondering, um,

38:48.498 --> 38:53.002
you know when Sunflower
takes both Rodcocks at once,

38:53.087 --> 38:56.131
and she says,
"I can feel you in my eyeballs"?

38:56.215 --> 38:59.468
I'm wondering,
is that, you know, poetry...

38:59.551 --> 39:02.346
or can she literally feel
his penises in her eyeballs?

39:02.429 --> 39:05.474
I like to let the words
speak for themselves.

39:05.557 --> 39:08.727
Because I personally,
I really identify with Sunflower,

39:08.810 --> 39:11.063
and it seems like
she might be polymorphously perverse.

39:11.146 --> 39:12.981
- You know what that is?
- Yes.

39:14.274 --> 39:15.275
No.

39:15.359 --> 39:18.403
Well, Freud describes it
as a time before age five

39:18.487 --> 39:22.031
when any part of your body
can be aroused by almost anything.

39:22.116 --> 39:25.910
- [snorts]
- Like, your elbow... your kneecap...

39:26.911 --> 39:28.247
your eyeballs.

39:29.748 --> 39:31.916
I remember feeling like
I was the only one.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.587
So, if Sunflower or...

39:35.670 --> 39:39.258
anyone... felt that way...

39:39.341 --> 39:43.220
I'd want them to know that...
they aren't alone.

39:47.015 --> 39:49.434
Suzanne, you forgot your...

39:53.355 --> 39:56.233
I'm scared to ask.
How did it go with Gerber?

39:56.316 --> 39:57.859
[whispers] Who's Gerber?

39:57.942 --> 40:00.404
Baby face...
our corruptible young man.

40:00.487 --> 40:02.489
Oh, yeah! [chuckles]

40:02.572 --> 40:05.534
We met at a dog park
near his house.

40:05.617 --> 40:08.120
You know, he dyed his dog
to look like a tiger.

40:08.203 --> 40:09.663
But you got the goods?

40:11.206 --> 40:14.209
Oh, my God, you don't know yet.
Of course you don't know.

40:14.293 --> 40:16.670
Oh, no, Cal...
What happened?

40:16.753 --> 40:19.714
[whispers] Pipes...
we sold out overnight.

40:21.841 --> 40:24.344
[whispers] Shut up.

40:24.428 --> 40:26.721
- Yes.
- All 20 pairs?

40:26.805 --> 40:29.349
Frankly, I think we're selling ourselves
a little short at 50 bucks a pop.

40:29.433 --> 40:32.644
I think we should shoot for the moon,
and go for, like, 75, maybe.

40:32.727 --> 40:34.146
And the more we can get...

40:34.229 --> 40:36.606
Well, that means that
I'll have to recruit more panty girls.

40:37.399 --> 40:39.318
Seriously,
that's what you call them?

40:39.401 --> 40:40.819
This whole thing is like Christmas.

40:40.902 --> 40:42.987
- What is on your arm?
- Oh.

40:43.905 --> 40:46.491
Oh, yeah,
uh, there are reviews up on the site.

40:46.575 --> 40:48.076
Already?

40:48.160 --> 40:50.245
World Wide Web, man.
It's some fast shit.

40:50.329 --> 40:51.788
I hear it's the latest thing.

40:51.871 --> 40:54.123
- I wrote down the good ones to tell you.
- Okay.

40:54.208 --> 40:55.209
[clears throat]

40:56.460 --> 40:58.628
"Great service, lovely scent."

40:58.712 --> 41:00.297
Aw.

41:00.380 --> 41:02.299
"Prison bitches are the ripest."

41:03.300 --> 41:04.926
That's a good one, I think.

41:05.009 --> 41:06.010
What do you mean,
"That's a good one"?

41:06.094 --> 41:07.929
Does that mean that
there are bad ones?

41:08.012 --> 41:10.390
Uh, there are a couple,
but I'm not going to tell you.

41:10.474 --> 41:12.476
All people ever remember
are the bad ones.

41:12.559 --> 41:13.893
I'm in prison, Cal.

41:13.977 --> 41:15.812
I've got some pretty thick skin
these days.

41:15.895 --> 41:17.772
People think the packaging
could be better.

41:17.856 --> 41:19.191
That's bullshit.

41:19.274 --> 41:20.275
[shushing]

41:21.150 --> 41:24.028
I mean, you try packaging things
with stolen kitchen supplies.

41:24.112 --> 41:25.113
[softly] I know.

41:25.780 --> 41:28.074
But maybe they're right.

41:28.157 --> 41:30.410
Maybe you should repackage them
when you get them,

41:30.494 --> 41:32.704
and then you can ship them.

41:32.787 --> 41:35.332
Oh, man,
I feel awful that they look bad.

41:35.415 --> 41:36.791
Anyways, moving on,

41:36.875 --> 41:40.754
people are already asking
for some very weird stuff...

41:40.837 --> 41:44.132
- Huh.
- Like murder panties.

41:44.216 --> 41:46.175
Now, I assume that is when
the murderers wear them

41:46.260 --> 41:47.677
and not the victims.

41:47.761 --> 41:51.390
One guy really wants
Samoan girls with really big feet.

41:51.473 --> 41:53.600
- I don't know any Samoan girls.
- Oh, it doesn't matter.

41:53.683 --> 41:54.851
They don't have to know that.

41:54.934 --> 41:57.103
You can be anyone
that you say you are,

41:57.186 --> 41:58.187
but you gotta be careful.

41:58.272 --> 42:00.732
You can't go saying that
you're some black lady serial killer

42:00.815 --> 42:02.567
who specializes in killing bald men

42:02.651 --> 42:05.069
with blows from
a poison-tipped sai kata,

42:05.153 --> 42:09.157
and then the customer
finds a blond pube in there. Uh-uh.

42:09.241 --> 42:11.200
You gotta maintain the fantasy.

42:11.285 --> 42:13.119
Good point.

42:13.202 --> 42:15.121
You frighten me, but...

42:16.039 --> 42:17.416
good point.

42:18.166 --> 42:21.210
Did your mom let you have it?
I sure hope so.

42:21.295 --> 42:22.546
I'm grounded for two months.

42:22.629 --> 42:25.382
Well, you deserve it...
but you're still my little boy.

42:25.465 --> 42:26.591
- Whatever.
- [woman weeping]

42:26.675 --> 42:28.968
It was worth it to teach
that little bitch Laronne a lesson.

42:29.052 --> 42:31.346
What lesson?
What did he do to you?

42:31.430 --> 42:34.891
- Looking at me funny.
- What do you mean "funny"?

42:34.974 --> 42:38.687
Probably fagging out on me.
I had to school that shit-stabber.

42:38.770 --> 42:42.190
Baby, don't play tough...
and watch your mouth.

42:42.274 --> 42:44.318
I know you only did it
to impress that Benny.

42:44.401 --> 42:47.236
Benny? Benny ran away like a little wuss.

42:47.321 --> 42:48.863
He did?

42:48.947 --> 42:51.157
I should stomp his bitch ass next.

42:51.240 --> 42:53.410
I don't know who's the bigger pussy,
him or Laronne.

42:57.581 --> 42:59.874
[Coates] Come on, guys,
look at the pretty colors.

43:01.084 --> 43:03.712
[Pennsatucky] You're that one.
[Coates] Which one?

43:03.795 --> 43:06.881
That Downsy one that
keeps missing all the crumbs.

43:06.965 --> 43:08.592
Oh, yeah? Well, you're
the brown one over there

43:08.675 --> 43:10.760
that keeps swimming
around in circles.

43:10.844 --> 43:14.598
I'm not a stupid brown duck.
I'm a hot green duck.

43:14.681 --> 43:18.059
The green ducks are males, dummy.
You wanna be a man duck?

43:18.142 --> 43:20.604
It's a man's world.

43:20.687 --> 43:22.856
Name like Doggett,
maybe you're not a duck.

43:22.939 --> 43:24.273
You're a dog.

43:24.358 --> 43:27.319
Well, I can swim good.
I can fetch even better.

43:27.402 --> 43:28.612
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

43:28.695 --> 43:29.696
Let's see about that.

43:29.779 --> 43:32.198
- What?
- Fetch!

43:32.281 --> 43:34.242
- Fetch, Doggett, fetch.
- [scoffs]

43:34.326 --> 43:35.327
[barks]

43:35.410 --> 43:36.411
[pants]

43:38.413 --> 43:39.998
Good girl.

43:42.125 --> 43:44.544
- Good Doggett.
- [chuckles]

43:46.129 --> 43:47.881
Fetch with your mouth this time.

43:52.636 --> 43:54.804
- Go on.
- Okay.

43:54.888 --> 43:56.305
Fetch.

43:56.390 --> 43:57.599
[panting]

43:58.933 --> 44:00.602
[barking]

44:02.687 --> 44:04.147
What's the matter, girl?

44:04.230 --> 44:06.315
It's all wet here and muddy.

44:06.400 --> 44:07.484
Uh-uh-uh.

44:07.567 --> 44:10.904
Sorry, I only understand dog talk.

44:10.987 --> 44:13.197
You're a dog
playing fetch with a dog?

44:13.281 --> 44:15.367
That doesn't make any sense.

44:15.450 --> 44:18.036
I said, "Fetch," inmate!

44:27.336 --> 44:28.337
Good girl.

44:28.422 --> 44:30.298
[coughs]

44:30.382 --> 44:32.008
Good Doggett.

44:32.091 --> 44:33.593
[roars]

44:33.677 --> 44:34.719
[chuckles]

44:41.392 --> 44:42.561
Hey!

44:48.274 --> 44:50.610
It's okay.
There's no one around.

44:53.447 --> 44:56.700
Fuck, I like you so much. [chuckles]

44:56.783 --> 44:57.867
Okay.

44:57.951 --> 45:03.039
I... like... you... so... much.

45:03.122 --> 45:04.123
Okay.

45:06.417 --> 45:07.544
Right.

45:09.671 --> 45:11.339
Boundaries.

45:17.136 --> 45:18.472
I know it sounds rough,

45:18.555 --> 45:21.307
but sometimes
you gotta cut people loose.

45:22.684 --> 45:24.561
Sometimes people don't belong,

45:24.644 --> 45:27.522
and the most important thing
is the unity of the group.

45:28.898 --> 45:33.069
Yeah, I told her there was a place for her
and you wanted her back, but...

45:34.278 --> 45:36.447
she didn't seem into it.

45:39.325 --> 45:40.660
It's like you always say...

45:43.872 --> 45:47.041
Sometimes the kindest thing
is to let people go.

46:11.525 --> 46:12.734
[sighs]

46:16.112 --> 46:17.906
[snoring]

46:57.612 --> 47:01.074
So, is that, like, a...
Chinese thing, or...

47:17.799 --> 47:18.925
You want this book?

47:19.008 --> 47:21.260
I don't cook Italian much,
but what this woman does with butter...

47:21.344 --> 47:24.013
What'll I use it for, a doorstop?

47:24.097 --> 47:25.098
[sighs]

47:27.934 --> 47:31.354
Hey, pity party...
you need to let this shit go.

47:31.437 --> 47:34.148
You're right,
the food tastes like crap,

47:34.232 --> 47:37.485
and I get 1,000 different visions of hell
when I put it in my mouth,

47:37.568 --> 47:38.945
but your face is not one of them.

47:39.028 --> 47:41.948
We get it, you didn't cook it.

47:42.031 --> 47:43.032
Stop apologizing.

47:43.116 --> 47:45.827
The more you apologize...
the worse it tastes.

47:46.995 --> 47:50.999
You gotta move... the fuck... on.

47:55.419 --> 47:57.088
Thanks.

47:57.171 --> 47:58.673
I needed that.

48:03.427 --> 48:04.512
[sighs]

48:09.433 --> 48:11.435
Can I help you?

48:13.521 --> 48:16.190
No... never mind.

49:13.957 --> 49:15.499
[Stella] Holy shit!

49:16.292 --> 49:18.127
- This is major.
- [Piper] Right?

49:18.795 --> 49:23.091
I mean, there was one bad review,
but it's... not like I care.

49:23.174 --> 49:25.593
Although, they were... kind of right.

49:26.219 --> 49:29.347
Say you expand to 16 panty girls

49:29.430 --> 49:31.599
and you go down to two days
per pair of panties,

49:31.682 --> 49:33.434
that's 48 pairs of panties per week.

49:33.517 --> 49:35.979
Times that by $75 each,

49:36.062 --> 49:39.816
and you have a gross amount... of...
[chuckles]

49:39.899 --> 49:40.900
Holy fuck!

49:40.984 --> 49:42.151
What?

49:42.235 --> 49:44.278
$3,600 a week.

49:45.154 --> 49:46.155
Wow.

49:47.156 --> 49:48.241
But two days per panty,

49:48.324 --> 49:50.659
wouldn't that be more than
three pairs per week?

49:50.744 --> 49:54.163
Yeah, but you should
give them a day off...

49:55.498 --> 49:57.666
- for the Sabbath.
- Oh.

49:57.751 --> 50:00.544
Look at you.
You're a good Christian girl.

50:00.628 --> 50:03.047
- Actually, I'm Buddhist.
- Of course you are.

50:04.132 --> 50:06.467
Maybe they'll give you
a special Buddha meal.

50:06.550 --> 50:07.551
Ew, no, they're gross.

50:07.635 --> 50:09.846
It's some sort of gluten shit
instead of meat.

50:09.929 --> 50:12.640
But now that they're
cracking down on the fake Jews,

50:12.723 --> 50:14.350
I'm thinking of going halal.

50:14.433 --> 50:15.434
[speaks Arabic]

50:16.394 --> 50:18.646
You really know
how to work a system.

50:18.729 --> 50:20.774
I'm a hard worker.

50:21.607 --> 50:22.691
Mmm.

50:23.777 --> 50:27.155
So, what did Alex say when
you told her the good news?

50:27.238 --> 50:29.032
Oh, but I haven't told her.

50:29.115 --> 50:31.659
She's been busy.

50:31.742 --> 50:33.870
And by "busy,"
I mean psychologically unstable.

50:34.662 --> 50:37.999
And by "psychologically unstable,"
I mean annoying.

50:39.042 --> 50:42.086
Well... I'm honored
that you told me first.

50:42.170 --> 50:44.755
- Sixteen girls.
- Mmm-hmm.

50:45.840 --> 50:48.092
I have to make sure
we find girls we can trust.

50:48.176 --> 50:50.011
Yeah.

50:50.094 --> 50:54.098
Girls that we know will be into it.

50:54.182 --> 50:56.976
- "It" being panties?
- Yeah.

50:58.436 --> 51:01.647
- That won't be hard.
- It won't?

51:01.730 --> 51:03.817
No, it's like, um...

51:03.900 --> 51:07.195
it's like sussing out whether
somebody's into you or not.

51:07.278 --> 51:10.656
When you know it,
you know it... you know?

51:11.199 --> 51:13.451
On the other hand,
sometimes you can...

51:15.328 --> 51:17.246
suspect...

51:17.330 --> 51:22.543
but you're not...
totally sure-sure.

51:22.626 --> 51:26.630
And so, you're left...
sitting in that expectation...

51:27.882 --> 51:32.011
waiting for someone to...
break the suspense.

51:43.731 --> 51:46.817
Did that clear things up?

51:49.570 --> 51:50.571
No.

51:52.531 --> 51:55.409
In fact, that just made everything
a lot more fucking confusing.

51:56.285 --> 51:57.954
[softly] Uh...

51:58.037 --> 51:59.372
Sorry.

51:59.455 --> 52:01.082
It's not your fault.

52:03.626 --> 52:05.128
Yeah, it is.

52:05.211 --> 52:07.338
Okay, yeah.

52:08.589 --> 52:10.341
Yeah, it kind of is.
