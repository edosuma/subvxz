WEBVTT

00:26.985 --> 00:28.570
-Morning.
-Morning.

00:29.488 --> 00:30.489
Cream cheese tomato.

00:31.323 --> 00:33.992
If only you weren't happily married
with four kids, Mario.

00:36.411 --> 00:37.412
All right.

00:37.955 --> 00:39.039
Thank you.

00:39.122 --> 00:40.207
See you tomorrow.

00:40.290 --> 00:41.291
Bye.

00:49.842 --> 00:50.843
Still pregnant?

00:51.552 --> 00:52.678
What are you up to?

00:52.761 --> 00:54.054
The usual.

00:54.137 --> 00:56.974
Having a lovely day in the park studying.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.684
How are you gonna get my kids
some goddamn cousins

00:58.767 --> 01:00.102
if you're always sitting on a bench alone?

01:00.185 --> 01:01.854
I'm not alone.

01:02.437 --> 01:06.108
Look at all of these hot prospects.

01:07.150 --> 01:10.362
Check out that one with the green head.

01:11.363 --> 01:15.409
Bet he's got a big dick.
Like one of those long, twisty ones.

01:15.492 --> 01:16.493
That is very dark.

01:17.578 --> 01:18.579
Are you still on the apps at least?

01:18.662 --> 01:20.831
I am.

01:21.957 --> 01:22.958
And?

01:23.750 --> 01:25.252
It's slim pickings.

01:27.212 --> 01:33.969
The last guy brought me to a comedy club
to watch him do stand-up.

01:34.052 --> 01:35.053
That was the date.

01:35.137 --> 01:37.973
Just move back home.
I bet the dating pool's better here.

01:38.682 --> 01:42.394
I think it's just the sad reality
of dating in your 30s.

01:42.477 --> 01:44.188
If a guy's still single,

01:44.271 --> 01:48.150
there's either something wrong with him
or he's got baggage. I don't know--

01:48.233 --> 01:49.401
Why are we talking about dating?

01:49.484 --> 01:51.153
Who cares?
I wanna hear about you and the kids.

01:52.404 --> 01:53.530
The kids are fine. They're--

01:55.532 --> 01:56.950
And there's your answer.

01:57.034 --> 01:58.702
Bye. Meltdown mode. Gotta go. Bye.

02:08.503 --> 02:09.505
What are you lookin' at?

02:24.102 --> 02:25.270
What do you want? Filet mignon?

02:25.354 --> 02:26.480
Sure. You got some?

02:27.606 --> 02:29.775
-What?
-I'll take medium rare.

02:32.319 --> 02:33.987
The fuck is happening?

02:34.071 --> 02:35.572
That's a joke.
Ducks don't eat steak.

02:35.656 --> 02:39.034
We don't love crusty bagels either,
just FYI.

02:41.411 --> 02:42.871
What ya reading?

02:44.122 --> 02:46.667
An MCAT study book.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.002
It's…

02:52.005 --> 02:54.967
to prepare for a test
that you have to take if you--

02:55.050 --> 02:58.846
I know what the MCATs are.
I'm a duck, not a dumbass.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.306
What kind of doctor you wanna be?

03:02.099 --> 03:06.353
Maybe a cardiologist.
My dad died of heart disease.

03:06.436 --> 03:08.272
Why am I telling you this?

03:08.355 --> 03:11.358
Sorry for your loss.
That must've been rough.

03:12.609 --> 03:14.403
I do have a giant penis, by the way.

03:15.696 --> 03:16.947
Spiky, too.

03:18.448 --> 03:19.700
What?

03:19.783 --> 03:20.868
Just to answer your question.

03:22.494 --> 03:23.912
Were you listening to me?

03:23.996 --> 03:26.456
You come here every day
and publicly FaceTime your sister.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.333
It's kind of hard not to.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.503
I'm Larry.

03:32.296 --> 03:33.297
Elisa.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.841
So why do you think your sister's
so obsessed with your dating life?

03:39.511 --> 03:41.180
I think she's just lonely.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.725
And she wants us to share an experience.

03:44.808 --> 03:47.603
Or she's internalized
the patriarchy so much

03:47.686 --> 03:51.190
that she believes your only value is
in relation to men.

03:54.526 --> 03:56.695
You're a feminist duck?

03:56.778 --> 03:59.656
Well, one male duck
in a pond of lady ducks.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.325
You think I had a choice?

04:01.408 --> 04:02.784
Holy fuck!

04:02.868 --> 04:05.621
Put your dog on a fucking leash, asshole.
Read the signs.

04:06.747 --> 04:07.748
Same time tomorrow?

05:12.855 --> 05:15.816
Gary! Gary!

05:16.859 --> 05:19.236
Excuse me. Hi. Sorry to bother you.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.737
I'm from Animal Control.

05:20.821 --> 05:24.533
You haven't by any chance seen
a cattle dog around off leash?

05:24.616 --> 05:26.159
Answers to the name Gary?

05:26.243 --> 05:30.706
Oh, yeah, actually. Yesterday.
I haven't seen him today though.

05:30.789 --> 05:32.541
Ah, shit.

05:33.292 --> 05:34.293
That's a bummer.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.379
But, thanks though.

05:39.339 --> 05:43.468
It's just--
Big storm's coming, so, you know,

05:43.552 --> 05:47.014
I really hope that I can find him
and get him inside before it hits.

05:47.723 --> 05:49.016
Me too.

05:49.099 --> 05:51.101
I hope that you stay safe and dry.

05:51.185 --> 05:52.519
I will.

05:53.312 --> 05:54.646
If I'm inside a house.

05:55.564 --> 05:56.690
Take care.

05:57.941 --> 05:58.984
Classy.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.111
Using dogs as an excuse to talk to women.

06:02.613 --> 06:03.614
Hi, again.

06:03.697 --> 06:04.948
You came back.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.116
I did.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.160
I mean, I come here every day,

06:08.243 --> 06:12.873
so… here I am again.

06:14.750 --> 06:15.959
I brought you something.

06:19.171 --> 06:22.090
Corn and grapes.

06:22.174 --> 06:23.550
Did you Google me?

06:24.635 --> 06:27.429
No. That would be so weird.

06:33.352 --> 06:34.520
How's your sister?

06:35.020 --> 06:37.564
Fine. It's hard to tell.

06:38.148 --> 06:39.983
I called her last night,

06:40.067 --> 06:42.236
and I got a 30-minute diatribe
about preschools.

06:43.403 --> 06:46.615
Sometimes I think motherhood is just
socially sanctioned narcissism,

06:46.698 --> 06:48.408
but you can't say that out loud,
obviously.

06:48.492 --> 06:49.576
Well, you just did.

06:50.869 --> 06:54.039
Yeah. I don't know why I did that.
I love my sister.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.165
She's great.

06:55.666 --> 06:58.001
Food for thought, since you're feeding me.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.086
Okay.

06:59.169 --> 07:01.797
You seem to be
very concerned with being polite.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.924
-I'm not.
-Maybe you should trust your instincts.

07:04.007 --> 07:05.926
Maybe your sister is a narcissist.

07:06.009 --> 07:09.596
She talks about herself and her kids.
She never asks anything about you.

07:09.680 --> 07:13.016
Oh, that's not true. She asks,
like, a lot of questions.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.560
About your shitty dating life

07:14.643 --> 07:17.855
so she can feel better about herself
in comparison.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.565
She ask about anything else?

07:21.066 --> 07:22.067
She's busy.

07:22.150 --> 07:25.571
Tell her to stop minding your life
for her own amusement.

07:28.198 --> 07:29.575
Any other observations?

07:29.658 --> 07:33.579
Yeah. You've read the same chapter
in that MCAT book, like, 20 times,

07:33.662 --> 07:36.874
so it seems like you're either distracted

07:36.957 --> 07:39.835
or you don't really feel like studying
these days.

07:44.923 --> 07:46.466
You hear about that storm coming?

07:47.509 --> 07:49.303
Did you just recycle
that guy's pickup line?

07:52.055 --> 07:53.140
That was gross.

07:53.223 --> 07:55.100
-I'm sorry.
-No, no, no. It's cute.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.106
Can I ask you a personal question?

08:01.607 --> 08:04.860
What do ducks do in the rain?

08:04.943 --> 08:07.571
Those idiots over there, they love it.

08:07.654 --> 08:10.949
I usually just hide under that bench,
try not to freeze to death.

08:11.033 --> 08:12.034
Not that I'm complaining.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.053
You gonna invite me in or what?

08:37.893 --> 08:39.977
-Wow.
-Sorry.

08:41.313 --> 08:44.733
I don't have a lot of people over.

08:44.816 --> 08:46.610
No, I like the whole vibe.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.446
Little piles of mail,
little piles of clothes,

08:49.530 --> 08:52.616
little piles of shoes,
little piles of cords.

08:52.699 --> 08:59.248
My aesthetic is dorm room meets flophouse.

08:59.331 --> 09:00.624
Come on. It's charming.

09:00.707 --> 09:03.544
I mean,
I don't get invited into many apartments.

09:03.627 --> 09:06.421
It's just I haven't done anything
to make it nicer.

09:06.505 --> 09:08.924
I spent a month
thinking about doing an accent wall,

09:09.007 --> 09:11.301
but then I went to
the Benjamin Moore website

09:12.386 --> 09:14.304
and I got really overwhelmed.

09:14.388 --> 09:18.392
Come on. Pull the trigger.
Live your life in Technicolor, baby.

09:19.893 --> 09:23.480
Maybe you're
the long-lost third Property Brother.

09:23.564 --> 09:25.274
Who are the Property Brothers?

09:25.858 --> 09:27.818
I can't stop watching these guys.

09:27.901 --> 09:28.902
I know!

09:29.486 --> 09:32.865
Look, they improved that very sad kitchen.
I will give them that.

09:33.448 --> 09:36.952
Ten bucks, the husband cries.

09:37.035 --> 09:39.288
I don't have any money,
but you're on in theory.

09:41.790 --> 09:43.375
Oh, shit.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.294
No, it's a formula.

09:45.377 --> 09:48.922
The--
The macho, skeptical husband gets all emo

09:49.006 --> 09:50.549
when they get rid of his leather couch

09:50.632 --> 09:54.720
and they replace it
with old family photos and a sectional.

09:54.803 --> 09:57.598
Wow. You know it all.

09:58.807 --> 10:01.101
I have very specialized knowledge.

10:04.479 --> 10:05.814
Do you want dessert?

10:05.898 --> 10:10.444
I'm not saying no.
This is really great.

10:12.029 --> 10:14.823
I mean, you're really great.

10:18.285 --> 10:22.414
You say that to all the girls
who kidnap you in their bike baskets.

10:27.169 --> 10:29.796
You're sure
you wanna sleep in the bath?

10:29.880 --> 10:32.341
Why?
You inviting me to sleep in your bed?

10:33.133 --> 10:35.552
I'm an asshole, not a degenerate.

10:38.680 --> 10:39.848
How warm do you like it?

10:40.807 --> 10:41.808
Room temp.

10:42.476 --> 10:44.603
So I know
you like piles of things,

10:44.686 --> 10:47.648
but what's the deal
with the posters everywhere?

10:49.483 --> 10:52.986
I worked on a political campaign.

10:53.070 --> 10:56.323
I moved out here, and…

10:57.824 --> 10:59.618
I don't know if you follow politics.

10:59.701 --> 11:02.913
It's hard to be politically engaged
when you can't vote.

11:02.996 --> 11:06.625
That's actually what we were working on.
Voter turnout.

11:08.043 --> 11:12.214
Anyway. My candidate lost,

11:12.297 --> 11:17.094
and now I'm stuck out here in Denver
trying to put my life back together.

11:18.053 --> 11:19.680
-And did it work?
-What?

11:19.763 --> 11:21.223
Filling the void.

11:23.350 --> 11:27.104
No. But it did distract me for a bit.

11:28.397 --> 11:29.815
Kinda like joining a cult.

11:29.898 --> 11:33.402
Oh, but then you were like,
"Fuck politics! I wanna be a doctor."

11:34.152 --> 11:36.905
Oh, does it sound schizophrenic?

11:36.989 --> 11:39.491
No, no. Just sounds like
you're on a journey.

11:39.575 --> 11:41.785
I think I can help more people
being a doctor

11:41.869 --> 11:44.705
than I can working as a policy wonk.

11:44.788 --> 11:47.374
Well, that's very other-directed of you.

11:48.542 --> 11:49.543
What is that?

11:49.626 --> 11:52.212
It means you think a lot
about other people,

11:52.296 --> 11:54.590
even to the detriment
of your own happiness,

11:54.673 --> 11:56.091
from what I can tell.

11:58.719 --> 12:00.179
Are you always this perceptive?

12:00.262 --> 12:02.806
Honestly, it's a gift and a curse.

12:04.725 --> 12:06.185
No, it's really refreshing.

12:07.811 --> 12:09.980
I go on all these dates.

12:10.063 --> 12:16.862
And I'm not kidding, these guys either ask
boring, cursory questions

12:16.945 --> 12:18.780
or they talk about themselves.

12:18.864 --> 12:20.866
It's like there's no back-and-forth.

12:20.949 --> 12:22.367
I don't envy that.

12:24.953 --> 12:28.373
Do you ever get that feeling, like…

12:30.667 --> 12:31.919
is it me?

12:33.086 --> 12:35.464
'Cause all these guys
that I go out with,

12:35.547 --> 12:39.301
they feel like
the rotten fruit at the supermarket,

12:39.384 --> 12:40.928
like they're clearly defective.

12:43.472 --> 12:44.848
But then I'm like…

12:47.267 --> 12:52.773
"Wait, am I defective too
and I just can't see it?"

12:53.357 --> 12:56.318
From what I can tell,
there's nothing wrong with you.

12:58.487 --> 12:59.530
Well, you don't know me.

13:00.322 --> 13:04.201
I know you're a pretty cool chick
who deserves more than you think you do.

13:10.916 --> 13:12.751
I think this is ready.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.132
Good, 'cause I'm freezing on this toilet.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.307
Well, how about a hand?

13:56.044 --> 13:58.172
Oh, you dick!

13:59.339 --> 14:00.799
Gotcha.

14:02.801 --> 14:03.802
Hey, wanna get in?

14:05.262 --> 14:06.388
You know, to get warm.

14:09.016 --> 14:12.769
-I'd be naked.
-I'm naked. That's a double standard.

15:36.395 --> 15:37.604
You sure I can't help?

15:38.313 --> 15:40.941
No, I told you it's a surprise!

15:56.164 --> 15:57.332
It's everything we ate

15:57.416 --> 16:01.295
on our first date
that we didn't really know was a date.

16:02.129 --> 16:03.380
Except fancier versions.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.048
Like, instead of a bagel…

16:07.050 --> 16:09.178
…I made this sourdough.

16:09.261 --> 16:10.345
Why would I eat that?

16:13.640 --> 16:14.641
Not joking.

16:16.643 --> 16:17.728
Wait, what?

16:17.811 --> 16:20.731
How many times do I have to tell you
I don't like bread?

16:20.814 --> 16:23.066
I thought that was just bagels.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.736
No, it's all bread. No ducks like bread.

16:25.819 --> 16:28.280
You should never feed a duck bread.

16:28.363 --> 16:31.450
In fact, it can expand in our stomachs
and kill us.

16:31.533 --> 16:34.745
I guess that didn't show up
in your Google search.

16:35.537 --> 16:36.538
-Larry.
-What?

16:38.665 --> 16:40.000
-What's wrong?
-Nothing's wrong.

16:40.083 --> 16:41.084
Just being honest.

16:42.753 --> 16:47.007
And you could stand to lay off
the carbs yourself. Just saying.

17:00.604 --> 17:01.605
Hey.

17:02.606 --> 17:03.607
Hey.

17:05.901 --> 17:06.902
I'm a dick.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.070
No shit.

17:10.280 --> 17:11.281
Can I--

17:16.954 --> 17:19.705
You are the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

17:20.915 --> 17:23.417
And I'm terrified
of losing you, obviously.

17:24.294 --> 17:28.882
So I self-sabotage, obviously.
And I hate myself for it.

17:32.594 --> 17:33.762
But I love you.

17:37.349 --> 17:38.725
-You do?
-Of course I do.

17:38.809 --> 17:40.686
That's part of what's making me so crazy.

17:45.190 --> 17:46.441
You've got a temper.

17:46.525 --> 17:48.110
You should meet my dad.

17:49.653 --> 17:50.654
I don't like it.

17:50.737 --> 17:51.738
I'm not perfect.

17:52.739 --> 17:56.577
I have these impulses
that… I can't totally control,

17:56.660 --> 17:59.329
probably biological on some level,

17:59.413 --> 18:02.666
but I-I will work on it, okay? For you.

18:05.586 --> 18:10.007
Can I sit with you?
I just-- I-- I'd like to be close to you.

18:19.183 --> 18:20.184
That's good.

18:24.605 --> 18:27.232
-Sorry. It's Lili.
-You can take it.

18:33.238 --> 18:34.239
Are we okay?

18:35.365 --> 18:37.451
'Cause this backyard is a palace.

18:37.534 --> 18:38.619
And you are my queen.

18:40.537 --> 18:41.997
What you thinking about? You-- Fuck.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.749
You want to take me back to the park.
I knew it.

18:44.333 --> 18:46.043
I think we need a water feature.

18:46.960 --> 18:51.548
Like a little fountain. Like a bubbler.
Something soothing.

18:52.424 --> 18:53.550
Oh, fuck yeah.

19:12.319 --> 19:13.612
Where the hell have you been?

19:13.695 --> 19:15.239
Hi to you too.

19:15.948 --> 19:18.992
You've declined all my calls for, like,
the last week. What if I was giving birth?

19:19.660 --> 19:22.663
-Oh, my God. I didn't even think of that.
-Are you okay?

19:22.746 --> 19:24.289
I'm okay. I'm…

19:27.709 --> 19:28.710
I met someone.

19:28.794 --> 19:31.255
Oh, my God. That's great.

19:32.089 --> 19:33.090
Is it great?

19:33.173 --> 19:35.676
It is, and he is.

19:35.759 --> 19:37.177
It's just--

19:38.679 --> 19:40.097
It's early,

19:40.180 --> 19:41.181
and…

19:43.267 --> 19:44.268
…he's complicated.

19:44.351 --> 19:46.520
-Is he married?
-No.

19:46.603 --> 19:47.604
God.

19:49.940 --> 19:51.400
I don't know if I really wanna get into--

19:51.483 --> 19:54.444
No. Okay, okay.
It's early. It's new. I get it.

19:54.528 --> 19:56.280
Just know that I'm happy for you.

19:56.363 --> 19:58.740
And that he better know how
fucking lucky he is or I'll kick his ass.

19:58.824 --> 19:59.825
Thanks, Lil.

19:59.908 --> 20:02.578
Gonna check your cervix now.

20:02.661 --> 20:04.496
-Who is that? Where are you?
-I'm at the gyno's,

20:04.580 --> 20:07.040
seeing if this overweight baby
is gonna fit through my vagina.

20:07.124 --> 20:08.792
Go. We can talk later.

20:18.594 --> 20:19.887
Larry?

20:28.812 --> 20:29.980
Oh, hi there.

20:30.063 --> 20:31.190
What the fuck?

20:31.273 --> 20:32.649
You said you'd be back soon.

20:32.733 --> 20:34.484
I was only gone a few hours.

20:34.568 --> 20:36.695
I guess we have
different definitions of "soon."

20:36.778 --> 20:41.200
You shat all over the apartment.

20:41.283 --> 20:43.368
You left the back door locked,
so I couldn't go outside.

20:43.452 --> 20:44.453
What was I supposed to do?

20:44.536 --> 20:47.539
What? No, wait. Don't blame this on me.

20:47.623 --> 20:49.208
I'm not blaming. Just saying.

20:50.709 --> 20:52.377
You're an asshole.

20:52.961 --> 20:54.421
And you like that about me.

20:55.005 --> 20:57.925
You shat all over my MCAT book.

20:58.008 --> 21:01.094
I shat all over everything.
I mean, I wouldn't read into it.

21:01.178 --> 21:04.681
Oh, I'm-- I'm reading into it? I'm crazy?

21:05.516 --> 21:07.017
This doesn't mean anything?

21:07.100 --> 21:09.436
Hey, you said it, not me.

21:13.482 --> 21:14.525
Hey.

21:17.319 --> 21:18.529
What are we doing?

21:18.612 --> 21:19.613
What are you talking about?

21:19.696 --> 21:21.323
It's unhealthy.

21:21.406 --> 21:24.493
Who cares about healthy?
Healthy's boring.

21:24.576 --> 21:26.245
Healthy isn't exhausting.

21:27.746 --> 21:28.747
This is exhausting.

21:29.706 --> 21:30.707
Do you trust me?

21:32.835 --> 21:37.005
-Right now, honestly, not really.
-That's fair.

21:39.424 --> 21:40.467
Why?

21:40.968 --> 21:42.803
Well, I want to try something,
and if it doesn't work,

21:42.886 --> 21:44.137
you never have to speak to me again.

21:44.221 --> 21:45.222
Okay?

21:45.305 --> 21:48.517
But I need you to trust me
at least for the next hour.

21:51.645 --> 21:52.938
-Fine.
-Good.

21:53.021 --> 21:54.815
Take off your pants and lie down.

21:57.234 --> 21:58.235
Now?

21:59.611 --> 22:01.446
-On the floor?
-Well, it's clean.

22:02.322 --> 22:03.448
Isn't it?

22:04.074 --> 22:05.784
You have done so much for everyone else.

22:05.868 --> 22:07.160
You've done so much for me.

22:07.244 --> 22:10.163
So I just,
I wanna do something for you.

22:38.233 --> 22:39.234
What?

22:47.492 --> 22:48.577
Oh, my God.

23:03.008 --> 23:04.593
Oh, my God!

23:04.676 --> 23:05.928
Oh, my God!

23:24.071 --> 23:25.906
Oh, fuck!

23:34.998 --> 23:35.999
Fuck.

23:38.001 --> 23:39.002
Fuck!

23:41.296 --> 23:43.549
Fuck. Fuck.

23:51.682 --> 23:53.183
-Am I too late?
-Is that a serious question?

23:53.267 --> 23:55.936
Please!
I made a stupid mistake.

23:56.019 --> 23:58.522
Yeah. I'm sorry. You're gonna
have to re-register for November.

23:58.605 --> 24:00.566
Wait. That's-- That's three months away.

24:01.191 --> 24:02.776
Who knows if I'm even…

24:05.612 --> 24:06.655
You all right?

24:14.955 --> 24:17.374
Hey. Wasn't today the big day?

24:18.584 --> 24:19.585
How'd it go?

24:21.753 --> 24:23.338
-It didn't.
-What happened?

24:28.135 --> 24:29.386
I forgot.

24:32.055 --> 24:33.307
I forgot about the MCATs.

24:33.390 --> 24:34.391
You-- What?

24:36.101 --> 24:37.853
After months of studying…

24:40.105 --> 24:41.940
I fucking blew it.

24:42.024 --> 24:44.067
Babe, I'm so sorry.

24:44.151 --> 24:45.152
Oh, no.

24:45.777 --> 24:47.070
Maybe it's a blessing in disguise.

24:47.154 --> 24:48.197
How so?

24:48.280 --> 24:51.158
Well, now you have time

24:51.241 --> 24:53.911
to figure out what you really wanna do.

24:55.454 --> 24:56.663
I wanna be a doctor.

24:56.747 --> 24:59.458
Well, you thought
you wanted to be in politics too.

24:59.541 --> 25:02.836
You change your mind a lot.
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

25:03.504 --> 25:05.339
I feel like crawling into a hole.

25:05.422 --> 25:09.134
Well, I will crawl into that hole
with you, okay?

25:12.179 --> 25:13.931
You order takeout already?

25:19.728 --> 25:20.771
Hello?

25:21.939 --> 25:25.150
Jesus Christ. You haven't called
or texted me back in a month!

25:25.234 --> 25:26.235
I thought you died!

25:26.318 --> 25:27.528
What are you doing here?

25:27.611 --> 25:29.404
I am so fucking pregnant,

25:29.488 --> 25:32.282
and I drove all day in this heat wave

25:32.366 --> 25:34.368
to find out
what the hell is going on with you.

25:34.868 --> 25:36.537
Now let me in and just--

25:36.620 --> 25:37.996
and give me a glass of water.

25:38.080 --> 25:40.499
Just-- just wait. I'll be right down.

25:40.582 --> 25:41.917
-Give me one sec.
-Is he there?

25:42.000 --> 25:43.669
No. I'm coming down. One second.

25:48.340 --> 25:49.716
I'm gonna go out for a few hours.

25:49.800 --> 25:52.886
You know I get anxious
when you leave for that long.

25:53.804 --> 25:55.514
My sister's downstairs,

25:56.807 --> 25:58.225
and I can't let her in, so I'm--

25:58.308 --> 25:59.309
Why not?

26:00.936 --> 26:03.397
Hey! Why not?

26:11.822 --> 26:13.866
You don't even like your sister.

26:14.491 --> 26:15.492
That's not true.

26:15.576 --> 26:17.911
Don't lie to yourself.
That's why you moved out here.

26:17.995 --> 26:20.581
To get away from her and her judgment.

26:30.507 --> 26:32.426
I'm just trying to get out of the house.

26:34.928 --> 26:37.222
So now you're ignoring me.

26:37.306 --> 26:39.099
I'll warm up some food for you.

26:39.183 --> 26:41.059
-Don't play dumb.
-I'm not.

26:41.143 --> 26:42.561
Dumb bitch.

26:46.106 --> 26:47.858
-That's not funny.
-I'm not joking.

26:48.442 --> 26:50.694
-Don't call me that.
-Then don't act like one.

26:53.238 --> 26:54.823
I'm going out for a few.

26:56.158 --> 26:58.285
Don't shit on everything while I'm gone.

26:58.368 --> 26:59.703
What the fuck?

27:04.875 --> 27:05.876
I'm bleeding.

27:05.959 --> 27:07.336
I'm sorry you cut yourself.

27:07.920 --> 27:08.921
You cut me.

27:09.004 --> 27:10.631
I'm sorry you see it that way.

27:14.635 --> 27:16.386
Scallion pancakes look good.

27:18.222 --> 27:19.223
What happened to your face?

27:21.183 --> 27:22.184
What?

27:25.145 --> 27:26.647
I cut myself.

27:27.481 --> 27:29.858
Honey, can we figure out
what we wanna order in a sec?

27:30.526 --> 27:31.818
I'm really worried about you.

27:31.902 --> 27:34.404
I told you that I'm fine.
You don't need to parent me.

27:35.030 --> 27:36.865
Listen, I'm happy you found someone.

27:36.949 --> 27:38.909
But a good boyfriend
doesn't keep you from your life.

27:38.992 --> 27:40.744
He's not keeping me from my life, Lili.

27:42.829 --> 27:46.750
He's keeping me from you,
and that's been better for me.

27:47.876 --> 27:50.504
You're always pressuring me to date.

27:51.672 --> 27:53.215
And asking about the future.

27:53.298 --> 27:55.676
I just want you to figure out
what makes you happy.

27:55.759 --> 27:57.803
But see,
even the way that you just said that.

27:58.303 --> 27:59.721
Maybe I am happy.

27:59.805 --> 28:01.974
Well, good. Someone should be.

28:02.891 --> 28:04.101
You're not happy?

28:04.184 --> 28:06.103
Of course not.

28:06.687 --> 28:09.231
This baby was an accident.

28:09.314 --> 28:11.942
I mean, Andrew and I barely have sex,
so it was a real fucking shock.

28:12.025 --> 28:15.070
And whatever, she'll get here,
and I'll love her.

28:15.153 --> 28:17.364
But I was really hoping
to get my body back.

28:17.447 --> 28:18.574
And my life back.

28:22.536 --> 28:23.745
I missed the MCATs.

28:23.829 --> 28:24.913
What? Why?

28:25.497 --> 28:27.749
I don't think
that I'm cut out to be a doctor.

28:27.833 --> 28:29.084
What are you talking about?

28:29.168 --> 28:31.879
I change my mind all the time.

28:32.921 --> 28:35.465
I'm constantly questioning my choices.

28:36.216 --> 28:37.551
I can barely take care of myself.

28:37.634 --> 28:40.053
What makes me think I'm qualified
to care for anybody else?

28:40.137 --> 28:41.763
What? No, that's insane.

28:42.264 --> 28:44.349
You're one of the smartest,
most caring people I know.

28:44.433 --> 28:47.227
When Dad was sick,
you were there every step of the way,

28:47.311 --> 28:49.771
asking all the right questions,
way more than I was.

28:49.855 --> 28:52.274
'Cause I was single
and super codependent with him.

28:52.357 --> 28:54.985
No. Because you're a good person.

28:56.111 --> 28:58.030
You're a great person.

28:58.655 --> 28:59.907
Did he put that idea in your head?

29:04.703 --> 29:06.496
Look, if this guy
is making you feel like shit,

29:06.580 --> 29:09.499
I swear to God, I will come over there
and fucking murder him,

29:09.583 --> 29:12.252
and they can put my pregnant ass
in prison. I'm not kidding.

29:20.344 --> 29:21.762
No. Let's just order.

29:29.770 --> 29:32.439
Well, please don't go into labor
on the drive home.

29:32.523 --> 29:34.441
Well, if I do, it'll be your fault.

29:36.485 --> 29:37.486
I love you.

29:38.612 --> 29:39.696
Answer your phone.

30:06.723 --> 30:07.891
Thanks so much for coming…

30:07.975 --> 30:10.018
-Elisa?
-…I didn't know who else to call.

30:16.608 --> 30:18.694
Hey, little buddy.

30:19.236 --> 30:22.447
Why the fuck is this bearded dragon here?
Who let you in?

30:23.782 --> 30:25.951
Wow, someone's a little angry.

30:26.034 --> 30:28.120
Don't worry. I'm not gonna hurt you.

30:28.203 --> 30:32.082
If this condescending twat
thinks he can fucking outsmart me…

30:32.165 --> 30:35.836
Elisa? Honey? Elisa.
You stupid ugly bitch.

30:35.919 --> 30:38.338
Is it-- Is this your idea?
Traitorous whore!

30:38.422 --> 30:39.965
He's got a mouth on him.

30:40.048 --> 30:41.508
Okay, dickhead, get away from me.

30:41.592 --> 30:42.593
-Okay.
-Elisa?

30:42.676 --> 30:44.845
Right here. Yes!

30:45.345 --> 30:46.555
Okay.

30:47.931 --> 30:51.768
All set. Time to go.

30:51.852 --> 30:54.188
I'm not leaving.
This is-- This is my apartment.

30:54.271 --> 30:56.690
Elisa, I'll fucking kill you!

31:04.698 --> 31:06.700
-Hey.
-Hey.

31:07.659 --> 31:09.119
Thanks again.

31:09.203 --> 31:11.455
Oh, yeah. It's my job.

31:13.165 --> 31:16.502
Oh, my God. I am so sorry.
Do I have to pay you?

31:16.585 --> 31:19.296
No. I'm a municipal service.
The city pays me.

31:20.464 --> 31:23.926
I wanted to make sure you were all right.

31:24.009 --> 31:26.428
You seemed pretty freaked out in there.

31:28.138 --> 31:29.139
Yeah.

31:33.894 --> 31:36.146
It's been rough with the duck.

31:36.230 --> 31:38.524
Oh, yeah.

31:38.607 --> 31:42.819
They are a weirdly aggressive animal.

31:42.903 --> 31:45.197
You'd think they'd be all cute and cuddly,

31:45.280 --> 31:48.200
but they're actually mean as shit.

31:48.283 --> 31:50.327
Especially the males.

31:50.869 --> 31:52.955
I'm surprised you were able
to keep one this long.

31:53.872 --> 31:55.874
It's surprising what you can put up with.

31:57.167 --> 32:00.379
Did you read that article,
in The New Yorker, I think?

32:00.462 --> 32:04.216
It was all about duck sex
and the patriarchy.

32:04.299 --> 32:07.719
There was some truly
mind-blowing stuff in there.

32:09.555 --> 32:11.974
I'm sorry. I'm not a creep or anything.
I promise.

32:12.057 --> 32:15.602
I'm just kind of a big science nerd.

32:17.104 --> 32:18.188
-You too?
-Yeah.

32:18.272 --> 32:19.273
What?

32:19.356 --> 32:20.816
-You know. Yeah.
-Okay! Look, yeah.

32:20.899 --> 32:22.067
When are you taking the MCAT?

32:22.150 --> 32:24.361
Well, so in a few months,

32:24.444 --> 32:27.614
and I'm trying to, like,
get my head back in the game.

32:28.907 --> 32:30.826
Do you need a lift down to the park?

32:30.909 --> 32:32.119
I gotta drop that asshole

32:32.202 --> 32:33.579
-back at the pond anyway, so…
-No. No.

32:35.080 --> 32:37.040
Look at that little guy, right?

32:37.124 --> 32:40.878
Yeah, I think that I--
I need to be around people.

32:41.795 --> 32:43.338
So I'm gonna find a café.

32:43.422 --> 32:46.508
Well, if you still want a pet
after all this, get a dog.

32:46.592 --> 32:47.968
I've got two rescues.

32:48.051 --> 32:51.221
Governor--
It's pronounced "Guv'nor," actually--

32:51.305 --> 32:53.807
and Axel Foley at home,
and they are the best.

32:56.685 --> 32:57.728
I don't think

32:58.395 --> 33:01.190
that I wanna take care
of another living thing right now.

33:03.609 --> 33:05.027
Except, you know, myself.

33:06.737 --> 33:11.700
Well, I guess if you get into
any wild-card animal situation,

33:11.783 --> 33:13.619
you know where to find me.

33:15.996 --> 33:19.791
Or, actually,
if you wanna just get a drink.

33:23.545 --> 33:25.631
So I just got out of a thing,

33:27.049 --> 33:28.717
like, five seconds ago.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.511
No, I get it. Too soon.

33:31.428 --> 33:33.764
No worries. All right, well…

33:38.477 --> 33:40.562
Hey, maybe, though,

33:40.646 --> 33:43.774
can I call you in a few months?

33:44.441 --> 33:46.735
Say, after the MCATs?

33:47.277 --> 33:50.197
Unless, I don't know,
you've met some nice doctor by then.

33:52.533 --> 33:54.952
Well, I don't need to meet a nice doctor.

33:55.953 --> 33:58.539
'Cause I am the nice doctor.
