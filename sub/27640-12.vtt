WEBVTT

00:01.251 --> 00:02.461
(Both laughing)

00:02.461 --> 00:04.254
- (Snort) Stop, oh my God!

00:04.254 --> 00:06.381
- Oh!

00:06.381 --> 00:08.550
You must be having a lovely
morning.

00:08.550 --> 00:09.760
- Hey now, it's just getting
started.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.511
- Is it just getting started?

00:11.511 --> 00:13.138
Because it looks like the two
of you have been engaged

00:13.138 --> 00:15.724
in general merriment
for quite some time now.

00:15.724 --> 00:17.893
- Did he just say "merriment?"
- I think he did.

00:17.893 --> 00:19.895
- Yes, I said "merriment."

00:19.895 --> 00:21.563
Because that's what happens
when I spend too much time

00:21.563 --> 00:25.067
with my mother,
and I blame you two for it.

00:25.067 --> 00:26.652
- So how was uh,
dinner last night?

00:26.652 --> 00:28.862
- Ooh, long. We spent
two and a half hours

00:28.862 --> 00:31.573
going over a costume lineup
for the show.

00:31.573 --> 00:33.492
All so that you two of you
could sneak off

00:33.492 --> 00:35.661
to some secret dance rehearsal
behind her back

00:35.661 --> 00:37.537
like a pair of dirty
con artists.

00:37.537 --> 00:40.499
- Hey listen, David,
your Mom is a great director.

00:40.499 --> 00:42.668
She's just not used to working
with amateur dancers.

00:42.668 --> 00:44.294
- Yeah, last week she told me

00:44.294 --> 00:48.173
to dance like an Indonesian
scarf caught in the wind.

00:48.173 --> 00:50.133
I don't even know
what that looks like.

00:50.133 --> 00:51.677
- This "Money" number
is so complicated

00:51.677 --> 00:54.137
that if we don't get
the outside help,

00:54.137 --> 00:56.098
we will be laughed off stage.
You've seen me dance.

00:56.098 --> 00:57.641
- Yes, you have legs like
tree trunks,

00:57.641 --> 00:59.977
we knew that going into this.
- Thank you.

00:59.977 --> 01:03.230
- Can we just have one more
private session with Derek,

01:03.230 --> 01:05.315
and then it's done.
- One more session?!

01:05.315 --> 01:07.317
I thought last night
was the last session!

01:07.317 --> 01:08.902
- Well, we couldn't nail
the final lift.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.654
- What is this,
"Dirty Dancing?!"

01:10.654 --> 01:13.532
- David, please, just keep her
distracted for one more night.

01:14.825 --> 01:17.369
- No. No! It's too much!

01:17.369 --> 01:19.371
- Okay, then I guess
we can just...

01:19.371 --> 01:21.164
tell her we're getting
outside help.

01:21.164 --> 01:22.958
- Mm, good luck.

01:22.958 --> 01:25.419
When she was coaching me for
the "Little Mister" pageant,

01:25.419 --> 01:27.796
I made the mistake of going
to Mario Lopez for advice,

01:27.796 --> 01:29.464
he was the hosting at the time.

01:29.464 --> 01:32.009
Anyway, she found out,
and felt so betrayed,

01:32.009 --> 01:34.386
she "forgot" to double-knot
my tap shoes,

01:34.386 --> 01:36.138
and cost me the crown.

01:36.138 --> 01:39.308
So I will cover for you
for one more night.

01:39.308 --> 01:40.726
But that is it!

01:41.893 --> 01:43.770
This better be worth it.

01:43.770 --> 01:45.522
Excuse me, I have a job to do.
- Oh.

01:45.522 --> 01:49.693
♪♪♪

01:50.902 --> 01:52.696
(Birds chirp, dog barks)

01:55.574 --> 01:57.617
- Mm, Ted, it smells so good
in here!

01:57.617 --> 01:59.119
What's the occasion?

01:59.119 --> 02:01.330
- Brunch. That we were supposed
to make together.

02:01.330 --> 02:03.332
- Oh, don't worry, babe,
I've already eaten.

02:03.332 --> 02:05.042
- So then I guess
I'll just have your plate

02:05.042 --> 02:07.085
for dinner, then.
- Mm, yum!

02:07.085 --> 02:09.796
- Hey, so I was thinking
about maybe going into work

02:09.796 --> 02:11.923
a little bit later today.

02:11.923 --> 02:15.260
- Yay, if that means more
Teddy time for me, then yes.

02:15.260 --> 02:18.013
- No actually, I've been
thinking about maybe

02:18.013 --> 02:21.391
taking a longer break from work.

02:21.391 --> 02:23.268
- I'm listening.

02:23.268 --> 02:26.063
- What if we got out of town,
just the two of us?

02:26.063 --> 02:28.523
- Like Thelma and Louise?
- Nope.

02:28.523 --> 02:31.151
Uh no, I was thinking somewhere
more exotic, like,

02:31.151 --> 02:32.986
I don't know, somewhere that
would have beaches for you,

02:32.986 --> 02:35.113
and some interesting wildlife
for me?

02:35.113 --> 02:37.657
- Okay, I've just been to Miami
so many times before,

02:37.657 --> 02:40.452
and trust me, the "wildlife"
is not as sexy up close.

02:40.452 --> 02:42.204
- No, I'm talking about
farther away.

02:42.204 --> 02:44.456
Like, I don't know...

02:44.456 --> 02:47.084
the Galapagos Islands.

02:47.084 --> 02:49.211
- I love that.
- Really?

02:49.211 --> 02:51.421
- Yes, as a jumping-off point,
yes!

02:51.421 --> 02:53.256
But if we're thinking islands,
why don't we do something

02:53.256 --> 02:56.468
less sleepy and scary,
like, The Maldives?

02:56.468 --> 02:57.969
- Definitely something
to consider.

02:57.969 --> 03:01.223
And I guess while we're
spit-balling here,

03:01.223 --> 03:02.724
you know, it could be kinda fun
to go somewhere

03:02.724 --> 03:04.476
that you've never been before.

03:04.476 --> 03:07.729
Like, I don't know,
the Galapagos Islands.

03:07.729 --> 03:10.190
- Yes, Ted! An island
somewhere for sure.

03:10.190 --> 03:13.485
We just need to figure out
where.

03:13.485 --> 03:15.654
But I'm so glad we're on
the same page about this!

03:15.654 --> 03:17.155
- Yeah, yeah.

03:17.155 --> 03:18.949
And-And what page is that?

03:18.949 --> 03:21.410
- Well, we both agree
that we wanna get away,

03:21.410 --> 03:22.577
and we both agree that
we're gonna land

03:22.577 --> 03:25.122
on somewhere so good.

03:26.998 --> 03:28.500
Mhmm!

03:31.294 --> 03:33.630
Roland: Hey, Johnny.
I heard the news.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.549
Boy, we are really going
to miss Moira tonight

03:35.549 --> 03:37.134
at the annual Mayor's Roast.

03:37.134 --> 03:39.386
I was looking forward
to getting scorched.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.596
- Oh yeah, well, she's gonna
miss it, too.

03:41.596 --> 03:43.306
- Yeah, I mean,
when she starts going off,

03:43.306 --> 03:46.560
oh my God, you better have
the burn unit on speed dial.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.520
I mean, get the fire
extinguishers ready,

03:48.520 --> 03:51.898
because she is just slinging
heat!

03:51.898 --> 03:54.276
Which ultimately becomes fire.
- Yeah, I get it, I get it.

03:54.276 --> 03:55.986
She can, she can be funny
on occasion.

03:55.986 --> 03:58.363
- Yeah, it's okay though,
I've got uh, Bob's cousin,

03:58.363 --> 04:00.031
Louis, from Elm County,

04:00.031 --> 04:01.825
he's gonna come in
and fill in for her, so.

04:01.825 --> 04:05.412
- Yeah well, Louis' the last
guy that should be driving in

04:05.412 --> 04:08.248
for tonight.
Uh no, I- I uh...

04:08.248 --> 04:11.084
I'm more than capable
of taking Moira's place.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.627
- Johnny, I don't think so.

04:12.627 --> 04:15.297
Those are pretty high heels
to fill.

04:15.297 --> 04:17.466
- Well, don't you worry
about me, I've uh...

04:17.466 --> 04:20.635
I've handled myself pretty well
humorously speaking,

04:20.635 --> 04:22.512
in front of large crowds
before.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.389
- Jeez, if you bring up
that Rose Video

04:24.389 --> 04:26.183
shareholder's meeting again...

04:26.183 --> 04:29.060
- You better be spending this
time toughening your skin,

04:29.060 --> 04:31.188
Because I've got more
than a few...

04:31.188 --> 04:33.398
rippers up my sleeve
for tonight.

04:33.398 --> 04:37.402
- Okay um, first off, I have
no idea what "rippers" are.

04:37.402 --> 04:38.820
- Well, maybe you'd know,

04:38.820 --> 04:41.573
if you graduated elementary
school.

04:41.573 --> 04:43.074
(Guffaws)

04:43.074 --> 04:45.494
- I can't believe you said
that to me.

04:45.494 --> 04:48.580
- Oh Roland, I'm sorry, did I--
Was that too far?

04:49.873 --> 04:52.459
- (Laughs) Look at your face!

04:52.459 --> 04:55.170
"Oh Roland, I'm sorry,
did I go too far?"

04:55.170 --> 04:56.713
(Laughs)

04:56.713 --> 05:00.258
Oh pal, you are going
to get eaten alive tonight!

05:00.258 --> 05:02.928
(Door latch clicks, slams)

05:02.928 --> 05:05.222
(Insects buzz, birds chirp)

05:07.015 --> 05:08.892
(Horn honks)
- Oh!

05:08.892 --> 05:10.852
Moira: David! What are you
doing walking the streets

05:10.852 --> 05:12.270
all by yourself?

05:12.270 --> 05:13.897
- You make me sound like
a feral cat.

05:13.897 --> 05:15.565
I'm walking home.

05:15.565 --> 05:18.443
- Don't tell me the store
is already laying off people!

05:18.443 --> 05:20.278
- No, Patrick sent me home
to get a cheque

05:20.278 --> 05:22.697
that apparently is tax
for the government,

05:22.697 --> 05:25.700
and not, as I assumed,
a bonus for me.

05:25.700 --> 05:28.119
- Well, I'm glad I caught you,
because I got your missive

05:28.119 --> 05:29.538
about wanting to sup
this evening,

05:29.538 --> 05:31.498
and I'm afraid I must decline.

05:31.498 --> 05:34.084
- What? Why? Why?

05:34.084 --> 05:35.293
- David, full disclosure,

05:35.293 --> 05:37.671
you have been awfully clingy
of late.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.089
- Okay...

05:39.089 --> 05:41.049
I think it might be propitious
for you to spend

05:41.049 --> 05:42.717
some time with your peers.

05:42.717 --> 05:45.345
What's Patrick doing tonight?
Or Stevie?

05:45.345 --> 05:47.097
- They're um, busy.

05:48.056 --> 05:51.434
- Busy? Well, rehearsals end
sharply at six,

05:51.434 --> 05:53.144
so either one of them
should be free

05:53.144 --> 05:55.272
to dine with you thereafter.

05:55.272 --> 05:58.024
- I just don't think they're
available tonight.

05:58.024 --> 06:00.151
- Hmm, too tired?

06:00.151 --> 06:02.237
- Mm, yes. Yeah.
- Yes.

06:02.237 --> 06:03.822
They've both been struggling.

06:03.822 --> 06:06.324
- Yeah, that's-that's it.

06:06.324 --> 06:09.578
Your choreography has been
working them so hard

06:09.578 --> 06:11.913
they basically just go home
and fall sleep,

06:11.913 --> 06:14.165
so actually your show

06:14.165 --> 06:16.001
is stripping me
of a social life.

06:16.001 --> 06:19.087
- Alright, David, but it'll
have to be a working repast.

06:19.087 --> 06:21.423
I could use your eye for the
final design of the posters.

06:21.423 --> 06:23.425
Okay? You employ the wrong
font,

06:23.425 --> 06:27.387
and you may as well bid Auf
Wiedersehen to ticket sales.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.347
- Can't wait.
- Until then, dear!

06:30.724 --> 06:33.518
- We're both going home though!

06:33.518 --> 06:35.770
What the hell?!

06:35.770 --> 06:39.316
- Alexis, you don't need to do
those dishes.

06:39.316 --> 06:41.192
- I didn't, I just put them
on the counter.

06:41.192 --> 06:43.987
Um, I also found this
on the counter.

06:43.987 --> 06:46.364
"Charles Darwin Research
Center."

06:46.364 --> 06:48.158
What is this?
- Oh, nothing.

06:48.158 --> 06:50.785
Just-just some work stuff.

06:50.785 --> 06:52.412
- It says you were one
of ten people selected

06:52.412 --> 06:54.956
for a research program.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.250
- Oh, what?

06:57.250 --> 06:59.669
That's... crazy.

06:59.669 --> 07:02.213
- Is this why you kept bringing
up those islands this morning?

07:02.213 --> 07:03.923
- Oh, the Galapagos Islands?

07:03.923 --> 07:05.967
Uh, not necessarily, no.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.304
- Ted, why else would anyone
wanna go there?

07:10.680 --> 07:13.516
- You mean, other than wanting
to study some of the rarest

07:13.516 --> 07:17.228
and most diverse forms of plant
and animal life on the planet?

07:17.228 --> 07:19.898
Uh, yeah,
I guess you have a point.

07:19.898 --> 07:22.859
- You were selected out
of thousands of applicants?

07:22.859 --> 07:24.611
- It just means that they'll
have plenty of people

07:24.611 --> 07:26.655
to pick from
when I don't accept.

07:26.655 --> 07:28.448
- Ted!

07:28.448 --> 07:30.659
Why didn't you tell me
you were doing this?

07:30.659 --> 07:32.869
- Because I applied before
we got back together,

07:32.869 --> 07:35.747
and it takes a couple years
to process the applications.

07:35.747 --> 07:38.249
- A couple years?
It sounds important.

07:38.249 --> 07:41.169
- Well, listen,
it's not not important.

07:41.169 --> 07:43.296
But I can, I can always
apply again.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.465
You know, Emmett,
the tortoise is 180-years-old,

07:45.465 --> 07:48.510
So I'm sure he'll still be
around in another few years.

07:48.510 --> 07:52.222
- You love old tortoises!
It sounds like a dream.

07:52.222 --> 07:54.265
How long is the program?

07:54.265 --> 07:56.184
- Six months.

07:56.184 --> 07:58.103
- Oh, wow.

07:58.103 --> 07:59.729
- Yeah, see, this is why
I didn't wanna push it

07:59.729 --> 08:01.314
on you this morning, okay?

08:01.314 --> 08:05.193
Because you mean way more to me
than some dumb...

08:05.193 --> 08:07.112
once-in-a-lifetime
job opportunity.

08:08.196 --> 08:10.156
- Ted, I don't know what to say.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.991
I'd totally think about it,
but like,

08:11.991 --> 08:13.576
my laptop's here...

08:13.576 --> 08:15.620
- Okay, honestly,
just don't worry about it.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.330
- Well, what about
long distance?

08:17.330 --> 08:19.082
I once maintained a successful,
semi-committed

08:19.082 --> 08:20.583
text relationship
with Josh Hartnett

08:20.583 --> 08:22.585
while he was shooting
"Pearl Harbor".

08:22.585 --> 08:25.046
- Okay, Alexis, I appreciate
your creative problem solving,

08:25.046 --> 08:28.508
But. you know, I-I wouldn't
stay if I didn't feel

08:28.508 --> 08:32.178
like it was... it was
the right choice for me.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.097
- Babe, are you sure?

08:34.097 --> 08:36.015
- Yes.
- But are you sure, sure?

08:36.015 --> 08:38.351
Because I don't want you to not
go like, just because of me.

08:38.351 --> 08:39.853
- Okay Alexis, that's exactly
what's happening,

08:39.853 --> 08:41.354
but it's fine, okay?

08:41.354 --> 08:44.065
And I told you that it's fine,
so it's-it's fine!

08:44.065 --> 08:46.109
- Okay.
- Okay.

08:46.109 --> 08:48.903
(Magazine rustles)

08:48.903 --> 08:51.740
- Okay... so we're all good,
then.

08:51.740 --> 08:54.284
That was a good talk
for everyone.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.119
You know what I am gonna do?

08:56.119 --> 08:57.954
I'm gonna do those dishes.

09:00.373 --> 09:01.666
Babe, do you have a dishwasher?

09:04.377 --> 09:06.755
Okay, I'm just gonna...
I'm gonna figure it out then.

09:07.839 --> 09:09.632
Okay.

09:10.842 --> 09:12.552
(Dish clatters)

09:16.723 --> 09:18.933
(Alexis sighs loudly)

09:21.311 --> 09:23.563
(Giggles)

09:23.563 --> 09:25.356
- Sounds like someone's
in a good mood.

09:25.356 --> 09:27.776
- What? Me? Oh.

09:27.776 --> 09:29.861
Sorry, you know those days
where you're just like,

09:29.861 --> 09:33.281
super in love?
- Hmm, not really.

09:33.281 --> 09:36.409
- You will. Anyway, I'm just
thinking about Ted and me.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.244
I can't believe we've come such
a long way, you know?

09:38.244 --> 09:40.205
- Aww!

09:40.205 --> 09:41.831
- Yeah. I just feel so lucky
to be with someone

09:41.831 --> 09:44.000
who would do anything for me.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.252
Like, I just found out that he
got this crazy job opportunity,

09:46.252 --> 09:49.089
and he's turning it down
just to be with me.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.883
- Wow. That is lucky.

09:51.883 --> 09:54.844
- He was ten people picked
out of like, ten thousand.

09:54.844 --> 09:56.846
- Oh my God,
and he's not going?

09:56.846 --> 09:58.640
- No, I think his perspective

09:58.640 --> 10:00.391
was that there would be
other opportunities.

10:00.391 --> 10:03.102
- Still, that must be totally
heartbreaking for him.

10:04.687 --> 10:07.816
But I guess relationships
are all about sacrifice.

10:07.816 --> 10:09.776
- Oh my God, yes,
Ted and I are so good

10:09.776 --> 10:11.569
at that whole give and take
thing.

10:11.569 --> 10:13.696
Like, he gives me so much,

10:13.696 --> 10:16.241
and I have learned to take
as well.

10:16.241 --> 10:18.660
- And I'm sure you give
things up for him

10:18.660 --> 10:20.954
all the time as well.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.247
- Totally.

10:22.247 --> 10:24.082
But also, he never really
asks me to,

10:24.082 --> 10:25.667
so that's hard for me
to do for him.

10:25.667 --> 10:28.211
But if he did, I would.

10:28.211 --> 10:29.754
- Oh, so he didn't ask you
to go with him?

10:31.464 --> 10:32.924
- Not technically.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.928
- Okay.

10:36.928 --> 10:39.180
One day I hope I find a guy
like Ted.

10:39.180 --> 10:42.559
Someone who would literally
put all their hopes and dreams

10:42.559 --> 10:44.561
aside to be with me.

10:46.396 --> 10:48.606
- Yeah.

10:48.606 --> 10:50.942
Yeah. Thanks for the chat, Twy.

10:50.942 --> 10:52.694
You're like my little
fairy godmother,

10:52.694 --> 10:54.946
if she wore an apron,
and Celine Dion's perfume.

10:56.155 --> 10:58.283
- Oh, so I've got a lot
of good material here,

10:58.283 --> 11:01.327
I just need some help sifting
out the gold.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.288
- I still don't see why
you dragged us into this.

11:03.288 --> 11:05.123
- Well, you can be a tough
audience, Ronnie.

11:05.123 --> 11:07.876
- What's that supposed to mean?
- See?

11:07.876 --> 11:10.879
That's what I'm looking for,
honest reactions.

11:10.879 --> 11:13.590
- Well, I've been honestly
reacting quite strongly

11:13.590 --> 11:15.174
to your aftershave.

11:15.174 --> 11:18.469
It's a bit too European
for my taste.

11:18.469 --> 11:20.763
- Not the most helpful
feedback, Bob.

11:20.763 --> 11:23.016
- Look, now that you've trapped
us here, just...

11:23.016 --> 11:24.642
- What-what do you got,
Johnny?

11:24.642 --> 11:27.186
- Okay, here we go.

11:27.186 --> 11:30.273
Well, it's 1791, and three
explorers have landed--

11:30.273 --> 11:31.482
- Next.

11:35.987 --> 11:38.156
- I was flipping through the
phone book the other day, and--

11:38.156 --> 11:39.949
- The phone book?
How old are these?!

11:39.949 --> 11:41.492
- Well, you're not even
letting me

11:41.492 --> 11:43.077
get to the punchlines, Ronnie.

11:43.077 --> 11:45.163
- Johnny, you need a search
and rescue team

11:45.163 --> 11:47.040
to find the punchlines
for those setups.

11:49.876 --> 11:53.004
- Ah! Top ten things
you don't want Roland

11:53.004 --> 11:55.173
to be in charge of:
- Ten too many.

11:55.173 --> 11:56.883
Johnny, you gotta be short
and quick,

11:56.883 --> 11:59.093
Like Roland in the bedroom.

11:59.093 --> 12:00.720
- (Laughs)

12:00.720 --> 12:03.181
- Now, that, that one
kills every year.

12:03.181 --> 12:05.516
- Oh no, I love that one,
is that one up for grabs?

12:05.516 --> 12:07.644
- No. You've gotta go
for the jugular,

12:07.644 --> 12:09.395
Just stay away from spouses,
kids, and health,

12:09.395 --> 12:10.730
and you'll be fine.

12:10.730 --> 12:13.316
Now, if you'll excuse me,

12:13.316 --> 12:15.860
I gotta get back to work,
which, up until now,

12:15.860 --> 12:18.571
was the most boring part
of my day.

12:18.571 --> 12:21.282
- Well, I'd love to use that
Roland in the bedroom joke.

12:21.282 --> 12:23.910
- Fine, but I have a feeling
it ain't gonna help you.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.870
- (Chuckles)

12:25.870 --> 12:28.623
Man, when she's on fire,
look out!

12:29.999 --> 12:32.502
- Well, you haven't seen me
on fire, Bob.

12:35.546 --> 12:37.382
(Insects buzz)

12:37.382 --> 12:40.134
- I'm glad I let you talk me
into another dinner, David.

12:40.134 --> 12:42.178
That note you had about
including my name

12:42.178 --> 12:44.222
on the poster as a sales tool,

12:44.222 --> 12:46.307
that's something I've been
debating for some time now.

12:46.307 --> 12:48.226
- Well, your name was already
on the all mock-ups,

12:48.226 --> 12:49.811
so it was really more
of an observation.

12:49.811 --> 12:52.188
- That reminds me, I must pop
by the rehearsal space,

12:52.188 --> 12:54.732
Jocelyn said some colour
samples were dropped off today.

12:54.732 --> 12:56.567
- Okay yeah, I--hmm.

12:56.567 --> 12:58.277
I don't know if-I don't know if
I need to see colour samples,

12:58.277 --> 13:00.405
you just showed me all
the mock-ups.

13:00.405 --> 13:02.323
- But the printers require
my sign-off first thing, David.

13:02.323 --> 13:05.451
- Well, it's-it's late,
I mean, it's...

13:05.451 --> 13:08.037
It's 7:15. Are you sure
you should be walking

13:08.037 --> 13:10.456
over there alone at this hour?

13:10.456 --> 13:13.543
- Okay David, no more
"True Crime TV"

13:13.543 --> 13:15.086
before bed for you.

13:15.086 --> 13:17.380
I refuse to buy you
another night-light!

13:17.380 --> 13:20.717
- Okay, well why don't I just
pick them up for you, then?

13:20.717 --> 13:21.551
(Cell phone beeps)

13:21.551 --> 13:23.803
Ah!

- Ahem.

14:27.784 --> 14:29.994
- David, what are you
doing here?

14:29.994 --> 14:32.789
- I have questions.

14:32.789 --> 14:34.749
- Mrs. Rose, this is Derek.

14:34.749 --> 14:37.085
He's been just helping us

14:37.085 --> 14:39.420
practice the steps
to the number.

14:39.420 --> 14:41.798
- And how long have you all
been moonlighting?

14:41.798 --> 14:43.716
- Just... just about a week.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.718
- It's a really fun piece.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.887
- Yes, I'm aware, thank you.

14:49.514 --> 14:51.349
- I'm just gonna head outside.
Stevie: Yeah. Yes.

14:51.349 --> 14:52.850
- Thanks, Derek.

14:52.850 --> 14:55.144
- So all this time I thought--
poor David thought

14:55.144 --> 14:58.064
that you were home,
resting your instruments!

14:58.064 --> 15:00.983
- Ohh...
- I'm so disappointed.

15:02.026 --> 15:05.154
Both: Sorry, David.
- It's okay.

15:05.154 --> 15:08.574
- However, in the business
of show,

15:08.574 --> 15:12.620
skullduggery, when it leads
to such thrilling results,

15:12.620 --> 15:15.665
a pinch of moral corruption
is a small price to pay.

15:15.665 --> 15:18.084
(Clapping)

15:18.084 --> 15:19.836
- Oh, is that good?
- Yeah, I think so.

15:19.836 --> 15:21.504
- You choreographed this?

15:21.504 --> 15:24.966
- I loosened the pickle jar.
Derek merely popped the lid.

15:24.966 --> 15:26.843
- Very impressed.

15:26.843 --> 15:28.803
Was not embarrassed at all.

15:28.803 --> 15:30.346
And I thought I would be.

15:30.346 --> 15:31.973
- So sweet.

15:33.224 --> 15:34.976
(Car rumbles, shuts engine off)

15:44.152 --> 15:45.653
- Babe!

15:45.653 --> 15:47.947
- I didn't like how we left
things this morning.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.032
- Me neither.

15:50.032 --> 15:53.077
I'm the one that
should be sorry.

15:53.077 --> 15:55.121
- No, I should've been
more direct,

15:55.121 --> 15:57.081
and we should've just talked
this through.

15:57.081 --> 15:58.958
And I actually did some
research on the Maldives,

15:58.958 --> 16:00.751
and there's this beautiful
resort that we could stay at,

16:00.751 --> 16:03.546
it just means we might have
to work there part-time,

16:03.546 --> 16:04.964
to cover the costs.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.466
But I feel like I could
teach windsurfing.

16:07.466 --> 16:09.260
- Of course you've done
research on this trip.

16:11.053 --> 16:13.222
But you've done too much
for me already.

16:13.222 --> 16:15.850
You do too much for me.

16:15.850 --> 16:19.520
And so I think it's time that
I give something back to you.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.105
- My FitBit?

16:21.105 --> 16:23.065
- No. I lost that.

16:23.065 --> 16:24.692
But the last thing I wanna do

16:24.692 --> 16:26.569
is stand between you
and this job.

16:26.569 --> 16:29.906
You've worked so hard,
and I'm proud of you.

16:29.906 --> 16:33.659
And so, yes, Ted Mullens,

16:33.659 --> 16:35.703
I will go to the Cayman Islands
with you.

16:35.703 --> 16:37.246
- Uh, you mean the Galapagos?

16:37.246 --> 16:38.581
- Yeah, wherever
the turtles are.

16:38.581 --> 16:40.833
- Are you sure, sure?

16:40.833 --> 16:42.627
- No. But, yes.

16:42.627 --> 16:43.961
(Both laugh)

16:43.961 --> 16:45.379
- Muah! Alexis, you continue
to amaze me.

16:45.379 --> 16:46.797
I can't wait to do this
with you.

16:46.797 --> 16:48.466
Oh! We're gonna need
to shots.

16:48.466 --> 16:50.092
- Yes! Let's celebrate!

16:50.092 --> 16:52.011
- Uh, no, no, no, I meant
like, vaccinations.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.554
- Mm...

16:53.554 --> 16:55.139
- Yeah, just 'cause we'll be
spending a lot of time

16:55.139 --> 16:56.766
in tents, and there could be
disease-carrying

16:56.766 --> 16:58.768
insects around, so.
- Okay. Okay.

16:58.768 --> 17:00.811
Um, this is still very fresh.

17:00.811 --> 17:02.730
I made this decision like,
two minutes ago,

17:02.730 --> 17:05.900
so why don't we focus
more on the beach,

17:05.900 --> 17:08.778
and less on the details?

17:08.778 --> 17:10.321
- Fair enough.

17:10.321 --> 17:10.947
- (Laughs)

17:14.492 --> 17:16.619
(Raucous laughter)

17:16.619 --> 17:18.537
- When it comes to making
decisions,

17:18.537 --> 17:20.748
Roland likes to go
with his gut.

17:20.748 --> 17:23.376
And boy, does he have a lot
of gut to go with.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.127
- Ohhhh!
(All laugh)

17:25.127 --> 17:26.754
- Yes, I do.

17:26.754 --> 17:29.674
- And look at Bob,
pretending to get it.

17:29.674 --> 17:32.677
And we all know Gwen,
he hasn't gotten it in years!

17:32.677 --> 17:35.012
All: Ohhh! (Laughter)

17:35.012 --> 17:38.516
- Oh, that-Ronnie is just
crushing it!

17:38.516 --> 17:41.352
I mean, you know, everybody
really has so far.

17:41.352 --> 17:43.771
- Okay, okay, that's all
I got for now.

17:43.771 --> 17:46.566
So I'm just gonna hand it over
to the one

17:46.566 --> 17:48.734
who wears the pants
in the Rose family.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.736
But Moira is not here
right now.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.196
(Audience laughs)

17:52.196 --> 17:54.407
- So I'm gonna pass it over
to Johnny.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.742
- All right, Johnny!
Go on!

17:56.742 --> 17:58.452
Head on up there!

17:58.452 --> 18:02.498
Let's see what you've got up
your starched sleeve of yours.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.292
- I'll tell you what I've got
up my sleeve Roland,

18:04.292 --> 18:07.461
a few tasty little rippers
that uh...

18:07.461 --> 18:09.630
are more palatable
than anything

18:09.630 --> 18:12.591
Jocelyn's been serving up
tonight, so.

18:12.591 --> 18:15.511
- Hey, is that a crack
about my cooking?

18:15.511 --> 18:17.888
- From the guy who's had
four helpings?

18:17.888 --> 18:19.473
(All laugh)
Roland: Yeah!

18:19.473 --> 18:22.018
- Oh, and Bob's joking about me
having four helpings,

18:22.018 --> 18:25.396
we all know if you've ever
taken your car to Bob's Garage,

18:25.396 --> 18:29.400
he's not necessarily known
"four helpings" anyone.

18:29.400 --> 18:30.985
(Chuckles)

18:30.985 --> 18:33.446
(Silence,
dog barks outside)

18:33.446 --> 18:35.698
- Well anyway, a couple
of little improvs there

18:35.698 --> 18:37.783
to get started, but uh, uh...

18:40.244 --> 18:43.247
what was I saying?
- Nothing funny so far.

18:43.247 --> 18:45.207
(Roland laughs)

18:45.207 --> 18:47.209
- Hey Johnny, come on,
I've got a white flag,

18:47.209 --> 18:49.253
why don't you just start
waving it?

18:49.253 --> 18:50.671
All: Ohhh!

18:50.671 --> 18:52.757
- Yeah, Roland, may I point out
that I was quiet

18:52.757 --> 18:56.010
when everyone else was up here
doing their roasts.

18:56.010 --> 18:58.095
- I wish you were quiet
right now!

18:58.095 --> 19:00.306
(All laugh)

19:00.306 --> 19:03.142
- Well, things seem
to be going downhill fast.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.269
Which is what the town must've
been thinking when Roland

19:05.269 --> 19:07.438
elected himself Mayor.

19:07.438 --> 19:09.065
(Audience laughs)

19:09.065 --> 19:11.359
- Okay, I'll give him that.

19:11.359 --> 19:13.527
- Oh, got a smile out
of Ronnie.

19:13.527 --> 19:15.071
The last time anyone saw
her this happy

19:15.071 --> 19:17.740
was at a 3-for-1 sale
on cargo pants!

19:18.866 --> 19:21.077
(Audience laughs)

19:21.077 --> 19:22.745
- Where? Where?

19:22.745 --> 19:24.914
(Audience laughs)

19:24.914 --> 19:27.500
- All right, Johnny, starting
to make some moves, now.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.085
- Cargo, I said car-go,

19:29.085 --> 19:31.337
which is what a car
is supposed to do...

19:31.337 --> 19:33.589
unless you take it
to Bob's Garage!

19:33.589 --> 19:35.132
(All laugh)

19:38.511 --> 19:40.137
- Well listen, I don't want
to overstay my welcome,

19:40.137 --> 19:42.473
I'll keep things short
and quick.

19:42.473 --> 19:46.227
Which reminds me of the last
time I was in Roland's bedroom,

19:46.227 --> 19:47.937
um... well,

19:47.937 --> 19:50.022
I-I wasn't in Roland's bedroom,
but the--

19:51.315 --> 19:53.901
Ah! What was it, Ronnie?
- Just sit down, Johnny.

19:53.901 --> 19:57.071
- Well anyway, the punchline
is, it was short and quick.

19:57.071 --> 19:58.739
(Forced laughter)

19:58.739 --> 20:01.867
Anyway, I'm gonna quit
while I'm ahead, folks.

20:01.867 --> 20:03.327
(Audience laughs)

20:03.327 --> 20:05.121
- I think it's a little late
for that, pal.

20:05.121 --> 20:06.872
- Ohhh!
(Audience laughs)

20:08.082 --> 20:09.667
- Good job, Johnny, all right.

20:09.667 --> 20:10.918
(Audience laughs)

20:12.378 --> 20:14.296
Johnny: No, I wish you guys
could've been there tonight.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.549
I was really ripping into them.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.342
- Yes, I'm sure you killed
them, dear,

20:18.342 --> 20:20.469
with all the venom
of a silkworm.

20:20.469 --> 20:21.887
- Oh, you know what, Moira?

20:21.887 --> 20:23.931
Jealousy doesn't look good
on you.

20:23.931 --> 20:26.100
Much like that mirrored
jumpsuit you wore

20:26.100 --> 20:27.977
to Candy Spelling's 50th!

20:27.977 --> 20:30.521
- John!
- Oh my God, Dad!

20:30.521 --> 20:32.606
- Why don't you take it easy,
Alexis,

20:32.606 --> 20:34.525
like you did with
your education?

20:34.525 --> 20:36.068
- (Laughs)
- Ugh!

20:36.068 --> 20:37.862
- I mean, he's not wrong.
- Oh, look at David.

20:37.862 --> 20:39.697
Smart enough to get that joke,

20:39.697 --> 20:41.991
but not smart enough
to stop wearing sweaters

20:41.991 --> 20:43.492
in the middle of summer.

20:43.492 --> 20:45.369
- Burn, David!

20:45.369 --> 20:47.288
- Okay, here's why that joke
didn't work.

20:47.288 --> 20:49.290
- And look at you, John.

20:49.290 --> 20:51.500
A worthy competitor emerges.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.711
Something the good people
at Blockbuster never said

20:53.711 --> 20:56.088
about Rose Video. Ha! Ha!

20:56.088 --> 20:59.133
- That was low,
like David's standards.

20:59.133 --> 21:00.551
- (Laughs)

21:00.551 --> 21:03.721
- Or the placement of Alexis'
back tattoo.

21:03.721 --> 21:05.764
- Alexis has a back tattoo?

21:05.764 --> 21:08.142
- Alexis, what have you done
to yourself?!

21:08.142 --> 21:10.603
- It says "that's hot"
in Cantonese.

21:11.937 --> 21:13.939
Got it in Hong Kong.
- Ugh!

21:15.524 --> 21:17.359
I was 12-years-old!
