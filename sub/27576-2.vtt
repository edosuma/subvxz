Well, I haven't had the
time to spend with her.

10:28.957 --> 10:30.891

to find someone else,

10:30.993 --> 10:33.995

10:37.399 --> 10:38.866
Hey.

10:38.967 --> 10:40.701
Let's get Lou to babysit
Lyndy for a few days,

10:40.802 --> 10:42.636
And you and I will go to Pike River.

10:42.738 --> 10:44.305
We'll do this thing together.

10:44.406 --> 10:46.774
What do you say?

10:46.875 --> 10:49.910
Maybe we could stay in our cabin.

10:50.012 --> 10:52.380
You remember that? I do remember that.

10:52.481 --> 10:54.248

that never happened.

- I sold Big River.

I told you, that's what's going on.

- What happened with Casey?

in front of the others!

haven't spilled the beans

12:04.074 --> 12:05.675
- to everybody already.
- Dad,

12:05.776 --> 12:07.443
I said I wouldn't say anything,
and I haven't,

12:07.544 --> 12:09.445
but it just about killed me.

12:09.546 --> 12:11.881
Okay, now tell me what happened! Dad!

12:11.982 --> 12:13.449
Never mind that.

and Nicole yet?

12:15.886 --> 12:17.120
No, and don't say anything.

12:17.221 --> 12:19.055
I haven't told anyone about that,
either.

12:28.432 --> 12:30.466
why did you have to move
out of Big River so fast?

12:30.567 --> 12:32.468
There's a lot of things
I don't understand.

12:32.569 --> 12:35.338
My buyer wanted a quick close
and I was fine with that.

12:35.439 --> 12:37.607
Yeah well, you know what?
I'm not fine with it.

can just move in here?!

- Yeah.

12:55.159 --> 12:56.926
- Where you going?
- Pike River.

12:57.027 --> 12:58.494
We're leaving first

12:58.595 --> 13:00.630
Well,
given the new living circumstances,

13:00.731 --> 13:02.632
I'll move into the loft so
I can take care of Lyndy.

- Okay.
- Great, I'll take your room.

13:23.253 --> 13:25.721
Who does he think he is?

13:25.823 --> 13:27.824
So that call during
dinner was from Evelyn,

13:27.925 --> 13:30.326
and uh,
it turns out that she is very sick.

13:30.427 --> 13:32.195
And that's why she wants me to come.

13:32.296 --> 13:33.930
- She's sick?
- Yes.

13:34.031 --> 13:36.499
She's manipulating you.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.734
She's not manipulating me Jack,
she's ill!

No, she says she's ill.

13:41.205 --> 13:42.438
Evelyn is Evelyn.

13:49.713 --> 13:51.647
Okay?

13:53.283 --> 13:55.151
It's because Tim's moving in.

I get it,
I'll just tell him he can't move in,

14:00.891 --> 14:02.225
and that'll be the end of it.

14:02.326 --> 14:04.660

Tim has nothing to do with this.

17:30.367 --> 17:32.635
that Phoenix is holding you back.

I'm absolutely certain that
when you start competing

17:34.504 --> 17:36.372

you'll find your competition

17:36.473 --> 17:38.207
