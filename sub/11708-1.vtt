WITH VINNY, JIONNI WITH MIKE.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.680
IT'S LIKE,
TONIGHT CAN GET UGLY REAL QUICK.

16:12.763 --> 16:13.347
- MISSED YOU.
- MISSED YOU.

16:13.430 --> 16:17.267
- HI!

16:17.351 --> 16:18.852
HOW ARE YOU?

16:18.936 --> 16:21.271
- I'M OKAY, HOW ARE YOU?
- AW, LOVE YOU.

16:21.355 --> 16:22.940
AWKWARD.

16:23.023 --> 16:24.066
- YOU OKAY?
- YEAH.

16:24.149 --> 16:25.901
- YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.
- THANK YOU.

16:25.984 --> 16:27.236
WHO ELSE IS HERE?

16:27.319 --> 16:28.737
- VINNY'S SISTERS.
HAVE YOU EVER MET MY DAUGHTERS?

16:28.821 --> 16:29.947
- NO? I'LL BRING THEM OVER.

16:30.030 --> 16:32.700
- I FEEL BAD
FOR JIONNI RIGHT NOW.

16:32.783 --> 16:34.159
I WOULD FEEL LIKE A LOSER
IF I WAS IN A ROOM

16:34.243 --> 16:37.871
WITH THE DUDE THAT SLEPT WITH
MY GIRLFRIEND BEHIND MY BACK.

16:37.955 --> 16:41.667
SUCH A PERFECT COUPLE.
- AW.

16:41.750 --> 16:42.918
- WHAT A PERFECT COUPLE.
LOOK AT THAT.

16:43.001 --> 16:45.587
- SALUTE TO THE AGUA.
- WHOO!

16:45.671 --> 16:47.214
- I WISH I HAD
A DIGITAL CAMERA.

16:47.297 --> 16:48.674
- AW.

16:48.757 --> 16:50.718
- I CAN PREDICT THE FUTURE,
AND I WILL LET YOU KNOW

16:50.801 --> 16:53.345
THAT TONIGHT, UM,
SNOOKI'S GONNA BE DRINKING,

16:53.429 --> 16:55.514
AND THERE'S GONNA
BE MAD DRAMA TONIGHT.

16:55.597 --> 16:57.599
AUTOMATICALLY. AUTOMATICALLY.
- I'M SO READY FOR IT.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.268
- MY BOY UNIT'S HERE.

16:59.351 --> 17:01.395
I MEAN, THIS IS LIKE
THE PERFECT STORM.

17:01.478 --> 17:05.022
RYDER AND UNIT WERE WITNESS
TO MYSELF AND SNOOKI

17:05.107 --> 17:08.359
GETTIN' DOWN
TWO MONTHS PRIOR...

17:08.444 --> 17:09.319
WHILE SHE'S BEEN
WITH JIONNI.

17:09.403 --> 17:11.696
- I'M GONNA GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

17:11.780 --> 17:12.823
- I'M GONNA GO HANG OUT
WITH JIONNI.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.324
- NO, NO, NO, STOP, STOP, STOP.
- I LIKE JIONNI.

17:14.407 --> 17:16.076
- I LIKE JIONNI, BUT JUST--
- I'M GONNA GO MAKE--

17:16.160 --> 17:17.618
- YOU'RE GONNA GO
FUCK WITH HIM.

17:17.703 --> 17:18.871
- NO, I'M GONNA GO HANG OUT
WITH HIM. I LIKE HIM.

17:18.954 --> 17:19.954
HE'S COOL AS HELL.

17:20.038 --> 17:21.080
- EVERYBODY KNOWS THE STORY,

17:21.165 --> 17:21.874
BUT IT HASN'T BEEN CONFIRMED.

17:21.957 --> 17:24.417
NOW THE WITNESSES ARE HERE.

17:24.501 --> 17:26.962
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE THE TRUTH'S COMING OUT.

17:27.045 --> 17:29.631
HEY, WHAT'S UP, BABY?

17:29.715 --> 17:33.969
YO, UM, HEY, THIS GUY RIGHT HERE
IS COMING BACK TO THE CRIB.

17:36.138 --> 17:40.225
IS THAT COOL?

17:40.309 --> 17:41.810
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON,

17:41.894 --> 17:43.312
BUT I DON'T TRUST
MIKE AND THE UNIT.

17:43.395 --> 17:44.813
SO I DON'T WANT HIM
IN THE HOUSE.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.732
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

17:50.736 --> 17:53.822
- WHAT IS THAT PUSS
ON YOUR FACE, SNOOKI?

17:53.906 --> 17:54.865
- [laughs]
- SHUT UP.

17:54.948 --> 17:56.658
- SMILE. DAMN.

17:56.742 --> 17:57.576
- YOU'RE SO ANNOYING, UNIT,
LIKE, WHO ARE YOU?

17:57.659 --> 17:59.661
- WHATEVER.

17:59.745 --> 18:00.913
- YOUR FUCKING
HAIR'S CURLY,

18:00.996 --> 18:02.414
YOU LOOK LIKE A FUCKING
ASSHOLE RIGHT NOW.

18:02.498 --> 18:03.999
- NO, DON'T MAKE ME TELL YOU--
- YOU NEED TO GEL YOUR HAIR.

18:04.082 --> 18:05.334
- YO, DO YOU WANT ME
TO TELL YOU ABOUT Y--

18:05.417 --> 18:08.003
- NO, STOP, STOP, STOP, STOP...
- I LOVE--I CAN BE FUNNY.

18:08.086 --> 18:09.171
I CAN BE VERY FUNNY.
- TELL ME ABOUT MYSELF.

18:09.254 --> 18:12.090
- I CAN BE VERY FUNNY.
- I WANNA HEAR IT.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.134
- TELL ME ABOUT MYSELF.
- I WANNA HEAR IT.

18:14.218 --> 18:15.344
- STOP, STOP, STOP, STOP...
- TELL ME ABOUT MYSELF.

18:15.427 --> 18:16.845
- I WANNA HEAR IT.
- STOP, STOP, STOP, STOP...

18:16.929 --> 18:18.514
- BECAUSE YOU FUCKING RIDE OFF
FUCKING MEXICO TOWN,

18:18.597 --> 18:20.349
SO WHAT THE FUCK
DO YOU HAVE TO SAY?

18:20.432 --> 18:22.309
- I WASN'T MAKING FUN OF YOU--
- NO, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY?

18:22.392 --> 18:24.019
YOU'RE A FUCKING LOSER.
- IT'S NOT FUNNY.

18:24.102 --> 18:26.313
- IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE MIKE,
YOU'D BE A FUCKING LOSER.

18:26.396 --> 18:27.523
YOU FUCKING IDIOT.

18:27.606 --> 18:28.941
- LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU
WANT TO BE FUNNY,

18:29.024 --> 18:30.067
AND LET'S GET HILARIOUS,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

18:30.150 --> 18:31.527
- IF YOU WANNA START,
YOU FUCKING IDIOT,

18:31.610 --> 18:33.111
I WILL START WITH YOU.
- STOP, STOP, STOP, STOP...

18:33.195 --> 18:36.115
NICOLE'S JUST GOING OFF,
SAYING REALLY MEAN THINGS.

18:36.198 --> 18:38.200
IT'S PROBABLY THE STUPIDEST
THING YOU CAN DO

18:38.283 --> 18:40.786
BECAUSE THIS IS
THE KEY WITNESS TO THE CRIME.

18:40.869 --> 18:41.954
STOP.

18:42.037 --> 18:43.247
- HOW ARE YOU FRIENDS
WITH A PERSON LIKE THAT?

18:43.330 --> 18:44.706
- SNOOKI, I GOT YOU, GIRL.
I GOT YOU.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.876
- OH, YOU GOT ME?
- NO, STOP, STOP. NO, STOP...

18:47.960 --> 18:49.628
- YOU GOT ME?
- I GOT YOU, GIRL.

18:49.711 --> 18:51.046
- FUCKING UNIT?

18:51.129 --> 18:52.798
YOUR NAME'S FUCKING UNIT,
YOU MORON!

18:52.881 --> 18:54.174
- I GOT YOU, GIRL.
I GOT YOU.

18:54.258 --> 18:56.969
- OKAY, UNIT! OKAY, UNIT!
- KEEP TALKING. I GOT YOU, GIRL.

18:57.052 --> 18:58.220
- OKAY, UNIT.

18:58.303 --> 18:59.972
GET REAL, BITCH!
- I GOT YOU SO GOOD!

19:00.055 --> 19:01.431
- GET FUCKING REAL!

19:01.515 --> 19:02.266
- WATCH YOUR SHIT, GIRL!

19:02.349 --> 19:05.519
- WHAT! ALL RIGHT!
- JEEZ.

19:05.602 --> 19:06.603
- GET FUCKING REAL.
YOU'RE SUCH AN IDIOT.

19:06.687 --> 19:08.480
- CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR FIVE SECONDS?

19:08.564 --> 19:10.232
- NO, I DON'T LIKE HIM.
- JUST LISTEN.

19:10.315 --> 19:11.358
DON'T INSTIGATE, AND I WON'T
TELL HIM TO INSTIGATE,

19:11.441 --> 19:13.527
BECAUSE YOU KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

19:13.610 --> 19:15.028
- DID I INSTIGATE, MIKE?

19:15.112 --> 19:17.322
- THIS IS THE MOST FUNNIEST
THING I'VE SEEN IN YEARS--

19:17.406 --> 19:18.740
HIM TRYING TO CONSOLE HER.

19:18.824 --> 19:20.075
- YOU LOVE
YOUR BOYFRIEND, RIGHT?

19:20.158 --> 19:21.785
- NO SHIT, YOU KNOW THAT.
- OKAY. OKAY.

19:21.869 --> 19:22.828
- ASSHOLE.
- OKAY.

19:22.911 --> 19:24.079
BUT HE WILL
SAY SOMETHING, SNOOKI,

19:24.163 --> 19:29.960
IF YOU KEEP
SAYING SOMETHING.

19:30.043 --> 19:36.008
I PROMISE HE WON'T SAY ANYTHING.
I PROMISE.

19:41.805 --> 19:43.682
- YOU OKAY?

19:43.765 --> 19:45.309
- FINE, I JUST...
I DON'T FUCKING LIKE UNIT.

19:45.392 --> 19:47.644
- SO JUST EVERYBODY,
JUST BE NICE.

19:47.728 --> 19:49.521
- I THINK SNOOKI
HOOKED UP WITH MIKE.

19:49.605 --> 19:50.772
AT THIS POINT,
I REALLY BELIEVE IT.

19:50.856 --> 19:54.234
JUST THE WAY SHE WAS
WHEN MIKE WAS AROUND JIONNI,

19:54.318 --> 19:55.777
AND THE WAY SHE WAS
WHEN UNIT GOT CLOSE TO THEM,

19:55.861 --> 20:00.699
OR UNIT SAID ANYTHING TO HER,
IT'S THAT GUILTY CONSCIENCE.

20:00.782 --> 20:02.034
- WAS HE HITTING ON YOU?
- NO, I JUST DON'T LIKE HIM.

20:02.117 --> 20:04.661
I DON'T WANT HIM NEAR ME.

20:04.745 --> 20:06.997
UH, I GOT TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

20:07.080 --> 20:09.625
BRB. OH, MY GOD.

20:09.708 --> 20:11.251
- I GOT A QUESTION.

20:11.335 --> 20:13.587
WHAT HAPPENED WITH NICOLE
AND MIKE IN THAT ROOM?

20:13.670 --> 20:16.465
- NICOLE AND MIKE IN THAT ROOM
WHEN I WAS WITH RYDER?

20:16.548 --> 20:18.216
- WHAT DID YOU SEE?
DID YOU SEE ANYTHING?

20:18.300 --> 20:20.677
MAYBE YOU DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.
- BELIEVE ME, I SAW EVERYTHING.

20:20.761 --> 20:23.472
AND IF SHE WASN'T TRYING
TO BRING DOWN MY NIGHT,

20:23.555 --> 20:28.101
I'M GONNA BRING DOWN
HER NIGHT.

20:28.185 --> 20:29.478
- YOU READY TO LEAVE?
- YEAH.

20:29.561 --> 20:31.146
- ALL RIGHT.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.314
- I DON'T SEE THIS
TURNING TO BE A GOOD NIGHT.

20:32.397 --> 20:32.814
LIKE, I'M ACTUALLY
AFRAID TO GO HOME.

20:32.898 --> 20:35.317
- TIME FOR WAR.

20:35.400 --> 20:38.362
- YOU GUYS GONNA MAKE OUT?
'CAUSE THAT'D BE AWESOME.

20:38.445 --> 20:39.863
- PAULY AND RY
ARE, LIKE, FLIRTING.

20:39.947 --> 20:43.325
YOU COULD TELL IT'S
DEFINITELY BOTHERING DEENA.

20:47.829 --> 20:49.164
- STOP.

20:49.247 --> 20:50.499
- YOU DON'T WANNA START,
YOU FUCKING IDIOT?

20:50.582 --> 20:51.875
I WILL START WITH YOU.

20:51.959 --> 20:52.918
- HOW DID THIS
TURN INTO SO MUCH DRAMA?

20:53.001 --> 20:55.170
- 'CAUSE UNIT'S
A FUCKING DICK.

20:55.253 --> 20:56.838
- I DON'T WANT THERE
TO BE ANY DRAMA.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.173
I JUST TOLD HER,
"HANG OUT WITH JIONNI..."

20:58.256 --> 20:59.591
- THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.385
- "I'M GONNA HANG OUT WITH HIM,
AND THAT'S IT."

21:01.468 --> 21:02.678
AND THEN SHE'S LIKE, "I DON'T
CARE, I HATE YOUR FRIEND.

21:02.761 --> 21:03.679
"I HATE YOUR--YEAH--
FUCK HIM, FUCK HIM."

21:03.762 --> 21:05.138
- WHY?
- AND I'M LIKE--

21:05.222 --> 21:06.306
- BECAUSE SHE THINKS
HE'S GONNA SAY SOMETHING.

21:06.390 --> 21:07.349
- YEAH, BUT YOU FUCKING
SAID IT ALL IN ITALY.

21:07.432 --> 21:11.186
- BUT NOT WHILE
TWO WITNESSES ARE THERE.

21:11.269 --> 21:15.565
- THIS PARTY IS TURNING
INTO A DISASTER.

21:15.649 --> 21:18.485
NICOLE AND UNIT ARE FIGHTING,
AND MIKE'S STEPPING IN.

21:18.568 --> 21:21.530
LIKE, I DON'T SEE THIS TURNING
TO BE, LIKE, A GOOD NIGHT.

21:21.613 --> 21:22.864
- UNIT'S BEING A FUCKER.
- I TALKED TO HIM.

21:22.948 --> 21:26.868
- WHO?
- HE SAID--UNIT.

21:26.952 --> 21:28.620
- YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE
TRYING TO DO RIGHT NOW.

21:28.704 --> 21:30.580
- BUT HE'S NOT,
'CAUSE HE DIDN'T.

21:30.664 --> 21:32.582
- HE DIDN'T WHAT?
- CAN YOU TURN THE WATER ON?

21:32.666 --> 21:33.750
- YEAH.
- HE HASN'T SAID ANYTHING.

21:33.834 --> 21:36.378
- ABOUT WHAT?
- ABOUT BEING IN THAT ROOM.

21:36.461 --> 21:38.839
- BUT HE SAID IF YOU
KEEP FUCKING WITH HIM,

21:38.922 --> 21:40.090
HE'S GONNA
BULLSHIT YOU.

21:40.173 --> 21:41.717
- ALL RIGHT,
DO THAT, THEN.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.802
- NO.
DO YOU WANT JIONNI INVOLVED?

21:43.885 --> 21:46.722
- UM, OBVI, NO.

21:46.805 --> 21:48.098
- ALL RIGHT,
SO ARE WE GONNA

21:48.181 --> 21:51.893
WALK AWAY FROM THIS
AT THE HOUSE?

21:51.977 --> 21:53.770
- I SAW YOU EARLIER TALKING TO
WHO YOU SHOULDN'T BE TALKING TO.

21:53.854 --> 21:57.190
AND I'M LIKE, JIONNI...
- YES, YES, YES, YES, YES...

21:57.274 --> 21:58.233
YO, RONNIE,

21:58.317 --> 21:59.568
DO YOU WANNA KNOW
SOMETHING FUNNY?

21:59.651 --> 22:01.069
ALL TWO WITNESSES
ARE GONNA BE

22:01.153 --> 22:02.654
IN THE SAME HOUSE, THE SAME TIME
WITH THE BOYFRIEND.

22:02.738 --> 22:06.408
LIKE, THAT'S FUCKING CRAZY.
THAT'S, LIKE, IRONIC. POETIC.

22:06.491 --> 22:08.368
IT'S INSANE.

22:08.452 --> 22:09.286
- NICOLE SHOULDN'T BE
BLOWING UP ON THE UNIT

22:09.369 --> 22:10.662
IF HE HAS DIRT.
THAT'S LIKE A--

22:10.746 --> 22:11.621
THAT'S LIKE A BAD CHESS MOVE,
RIGHT THERE.

22:11.705 --> 22:13.623
THAT'S CHECKMATE
FOR SNOOKI.

22:13.707 --> 22:14.624
- IT'S LIKE SHE
SHOULD BE CHILLIN'--

22:14.708 --> 22:16.376
- SHE SHOULD BE
LICKING MY ASSHOLE.

22:16.460 --> 22:17.419
- YES, YES, SHE SHOULD BE.
BUT SHE'S NOT.

22:17.502 --> 22:19.588
- SORRY.
I FREAKED OUT A LITTLE BIT.

22:19.671 --> 22:21.048
- WHAT HAPPENED?

22:21.131 --> 22:23.550
I LEFT FOR LITERALLY 15 MINUTES,
AND YOU WERE ALL PISSED OFF.

22:23.633 --> 22:25.052
- IT'S BULLSHIT.

22:25.135 --> 22:28.263
- WAS IT ABOUT ME?

22:28.346 --> 22:29.264
- LAST CALL.

22:29.347 --> 22:30.932
- IT WAS GREAT TO SEE YOU,
MY MAN.

22:31.016 --> 22:32.267
- YO.
- SO GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK.

22:32.350 --> 22:33.518
- GLAD YOU GUYS CAME.
IT WAS A SURPRISE.

22:33.602 --> 22:36.271
- COME BACK AS SOON AS I CAN.
both: I LOVE YOU.

22:36.354 --> 22:37.522
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- YOU'RE THE BEST.

22:37.606 --> 22:38.857
- THANKS A LOT, MAN.
-<i> YOU'RE</i> THE BEST.

22:38.940 --> 22:40.650
- I'M GLAD YOU GUYS
WERE SURPRISED.

22:40.734 --> 22:43.236
- I LOVE YOU, I MISS YOU.
- I WILL CALL YOU.

22:43.320 --> 22:44.112
- ALL RIGHT, BYE, MOM.

22:44.196 --> 22:47.616
- BE GOOD, ALL RIGHT?

22:47.699 --> 22:49.409
- HONESTLY, I'M GLAD
THAT THE PARTY'S OVER.

22:49.493 --> 22:51.912
I WAS ALREADY
SPINNING, EMOTIONALLY.

22:51.995 --> 22:53.622
JUST COMING HOME
AND TRANSITIONING

22:53.705 --> 22:57.417
FROM ITALY TO JERSEY,
AND SEEING MY FAMILY

22:57.501 --> 22:59.711
JUST PUTS THE FUCKING
WASHING MACHINE ON OVERLOAD.

22:59.795 --> 23:00.670
ALL RIGHT,
BE CAREFUL GETTING HOME.

23:00.754 --> 23:02.422
- ALL RIGHT, BYE.
- LOVE YOU.

23:02.506 --> 23:03.423
- LOVE YOU.
- BYE, VIN.

23:03.507 --> 23:04.299
- BYE, VIN.
- BYE.

23:04.382 --> 23:06.384
- YOU READY TO LEAVE?
- YEAH.

23:06.468 --> 23:07.427
- YOU READY TO LEAVE,
GO BACK TO THE CRIB?

23:07.511 --> 23:10.347
YOU GUYS READY
TO GO BACK TO THE CRIB?

23:10.430 --> 23:12.015
- YEAH.
- ALL RIGHT.

23:12.099 --> 23:14.309
LET'S ROLL. COME ON.
- UGH.

23:14.392 --> 23:16.478
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

23:16.561 --> 23:18.313
- LET'S GO, LET'S GO.

23:18.396 --> 23:20.440
- IT'S OFF TO THE HOUSE,

23:20.524 --> 23:23.151
AND MY BOY JONNY UNIT
IS COMING WITH ME.

23:23.235 --> 23:24.319
AT ANY MOMENT,
SOMETHING COULD POP OFF.

23:24.402 --> 23:27.489
THIS IS HURRICANE
SITUATION.

23:27.572 --> 23:31.993
OKAY? AND IT'S HEADING
STRAIGHT FOR SNOOKI ISLAND.

23:32.077 --> 23:33.620
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
UNIT'S STAYING HERE.

23:33.703 --> 23:39.960
- GO, AND TAKE A--
GO STRAIGHT, AND TAKE A LEFT.

23:40.043 --> 23:43.004
TAKE A LEFT. QUICK. COME ON.
- WHERE ARE WE? WHAT IS THIS?

23:43.088 --> 23:45.674
- THIS IS MY ROOM.

23:45.757 --> 23:47.425
- ALL RIGHT, SO...
WHERE'S SNOOKI?

23:47.509 --> 23:49.845
- I DON'T KNOW.

23:49.928 --> 23:51.221
- I DON'T WANT UNIT OR MIKE
TO START ANY DRAMA,

23:51.304 --> 23:54.266
BECAUSE THEY'RE ASSHOLES,
AND IT'S NOT NECESSARY.

23:54.349 --> 23:55.559
SO WHEN THE UNIT'S
IN THE HOUSE,

23:55.642 --> 23:58.311
I'M JUST GONNA GO IN MY ROOM
AND SMUSH JIONNI.

23:58.395 --> 24:00.939
- I HAVE MY SHOES ON.
- SHUSH.

24:01.022 --> 24:02.232
- IT WILL GET CRAZY DOWNSTAIRS,
SO YOU NEED TO BE PREPARED.

24:02.315 --> 24:04.651
- OH, I'M SO READY.

24:04.734 --> 24:06.528
- DO YOU WANT A WHITE OR A BLACK
TANK TOP RIGHT NOW?

24:06.611 --> 24:09.656
- I DON'T WEAR A SHIRT.
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

24:09.739 --> 24:10.991
YOU DO WHAT YOU WANNA DO.

24:11.074 --> 24:12.450
YO, IT'S THE BEST
YOU'VE EVER LOOKED.

24:12.534 --> 24:14.494
- RIGHT? SICK, RIGHT? HELL YEAH.
- IT'S NASTY.

24:14.578 --> 24:17.539
UM, I HAVE WHATEVER
YOU OBVIOUSLY NEED.

24:17.622 --> 24:18.623
FACE WASH, WHATEVER.

24:18.707 --> 24:19.166
DO YOU NEED
NEW DRAWERS OR NOT?

24:19.249 --> 24:21.168
- YEAH, WHY NOT?

24:21.251 --> 24:23.420
- YEAH, YEAH,
YOU CAN TAKE YOUR PANTS OFF.

24:23.503 --> 24:25.714
- OH, MY GOD.
LIKE, LET'S BE REAL.

24:25.797 --> 24:29.217
I JUST FEEL LIKE MIKE
HAS, LIKE, GAY TENDENCIES.

24:29.301 --> 24:31.678
- SEE, YOU'RE GETTING NAKED
RIGHT HERE, BUDDY.

24:31.761 --> 24:32.929
- YEAH.

24:33.013 --> 24:34.055
- OH, I THOUGHT THEY SAID
GO TO THE BATHROOM,

24:34.139 --> 24:35.557
I WAS ABOUT TO...
- NO, NO.

24:35.640 --> 24:36.808
- ALL RIGHT, COOL.
I'M GETTING NAKED RIGHT HERE.

24:36.892 --> 24:38.226
- OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.
GET ME OUT OF HERE.

24:38.310 --> 24:41.563
UGH...
THIS IS JUST SO WEIRD.

24:41.646 --> 24:44.232
MIKE NORMALLY WIFES UP
HIS GRENADES THIS WAY.

24:44.316 --> 24:50.739
IS HE DOING THAT WITH UNIT?

24:53.033 --> 24:54.075
- IS IT SUPPOSED TO SMELL
LIKE SKUNK UP HERE?

24:54.159 --> 24:58.955
- IT'S NOT ME.

24:59.039 --> 25:00.457
ALL RIGHT,
WE ABOUT TO GO DOWNSTAIRS.

25:00.540 --> 25:05.545
JUST GIMME ONE SECOND, PUT
MOISTURIZER ON, AND WE'RE OUT.

25:05.629 --> 25:08.798
TIME FOR WAR.
LET'S MAKE IT HAPPEN.

25:08.882 --> 25:11.509
MY BOY UNIT, HE'S GOT
ALL THE INFORMATION I GOT.

25:11.593 --> 25:13.136
AND HE WANTS
TO BLOW IT WIDE OPEN.

25:13.220 --> 25:15.931
ESPECIALLY SINCE SNOOKI
WAS MEAN TO HIM TONIGHT.

25:16.014 --> 25:16.890
SO I COULD JUST SIT BACK
AND JUST WATCH THE SHOW.

25:16.973 --> 25:19.643
- WE NEED FOOD.

25:19.726 --> 25:21.853
- WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

25:21.937 --> 25:23.897
- WHAT'S GOIN' ON?
- WHAT UP?

25:23.980 --> 25:28.276
- WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE BURGERS.
IT'S NOT SUCCESSFUL.

25:28.360 --> 25:31.905
- WHERE'S SNOOKI?
- SHE JUST WENT TO BED.

25:31.988 --> 25:34.032
- FUCK.

25:34.115 --> 25:36.743
SNOOKI KNOWS
WHAT'S GOING ON.

25:36.826 --> 25:41.289
SO SHE ELIMINATES JIONNI
FROM THE EQUATION.

25:41.373 --> 25:41.957
AND YOU WANNA KNOW HOW?

25:42.040 --> 25:43.875
SNOOKS?

25:43.959 --> 25:46.211
UH-OH.

25:46.294 --> 25:47.629
FUCK.

25:47.712 --> 25:52.050
SHE HID.
SHE HID THE WHOLE NIGHT.

25:52.133 --> 25:55.971
- [speaking gibberish]

25:56.054 --> 25:58.598
- [laughs]

25:58.682 --> 26:01.518
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

26:01.601 --> 26:05.146
- PAULY AND RY
ARE LIKE FLIRTING.

26:05.230 --> 26:07.899
YOU COULD TELL
IT'S DEFINITELY BOTHERING DEENA.

26:07.983 --> 26:09.276
'CAUSE DEENA ALWAYS WANTED
TO GET IT ON WITH PAULY.

26:09.359 --> 26:12.779
- 'SUP, MY NINJA?

26:12.862 --> 26:13.863
- ARE YOU GUYS GONNA MAKE OUT?
'CAUSE THAT'D BE AWESOME.

26:13.947 --> 26:16.491
- NOPE.

26:16.574 --> 26:19.953
WELL?
[laughs]

26:20.036 --> 26:20.495
YOU'RE DRUNK.

26:20.578 --> 26:25.292
- NAH. YOU?

26:30.088 --> 26:31.756
- OH, MAN.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.216
LIKE, RYDER'S REALLY RIDING
AROUND TOWN IN THIS HOUSE.

26:33.300 --> 26:34.926
LIKE, SERIOUSLY.

26:35.010 --> 26:37.137
VINNIE, THE UNIT,
NOW PAULY.

26:37.220 --> 26:39.431
- I'LL SHOW YOU WHERE YOU'RE
SLEEPING TONIGHT, ALL RIGHT?

26:39.514 --> 26:42.058
- OKAY.

26:42.142 --> 26:44.352
ARE WE GONNA CUDDLE?
- YEAH.

26:44.436 --> 26:48.148
- OKAY.

26:48.231 --> 26:50.108
- WHAT NOW?
- I DON'T KNOW.

26:50.191 --> 26:52.235
- LET'S PLAY.
- WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO?

26:52.319 --> 26:53.945
- I DON'T KNOW.

27:00.618 --> 27:05.790

27:14.632 --> 27:21.306
BYE. WHATEVER. I'M HAPPY.
AWESOME.

27:21.389 --> 27:22.057
- WELL...

27:22.140 --> 27:23.224
- HEH, WELL...

27:23.308 --> 27:25.894
both: [laugh]

27:25.977 --> 27:28.938
- WHAT UP?
- I'M JUST TIRED, MY DUDES.

27:29.022 --> 27:30.732
I'M SORRY.

27:30.815 --> 27:32.400
- RYDER'S LOOKING
PRETTY GOOD TONIGHT,

27:32.484 --> 27:33.818
BUT SHE'S ALREADY
HAD SEX WITH VINNY.

27:33.902 --> 27:36.154
AND I'M NOT REALLY COOL
WITH VINNY'S SLOPPY SECONDS.

27:36.237 --> 27:37.238
SO I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO WITH HER.

27:37.322 --> 27:38.740
- WAIT, COULD WE HAVE FUN?

27:38.823 --> 27:41.242
- WHAT'RE YOU TRYING TO DO?
- I DON'T KNOW.

27:41.326 --> 27:42.660
- BUT I DON'T
WANT TO BE RUDE, SO.

27:42.744 --> 27:46.790
WHETHER YOU'RE THE FIRST MAN IN,
OR THE LAST MAN IN, RYDER.

27:46.873 --> 27:51.169
- LET'S DO SOMETHING CRAZY.
- YEAH. [laughs]

27:51.252 --> 27:54.589
- [hums funeral dirge]

27:54.672 --> 27:56.841
- NICOLE HAS GOT TO
BEND JON RIGHT NOW,

27:56.925 --> 27:57.926
'CAUSE SHE KNOWS
JON'S GOT HER.

27:58.009 --> 27:59.094
- WHAT'S UP, SNOOKI?

27:59.177 --> 28:00.678
- HE TRIED TO BREAK
ME AND JIONNI UP.

28:05.767 --> 28:07.018
- [whispers] GOOD MORNING.

28:07.102 --> 28:10.021
WHAT DO YOU WANNA WEAR?

28:10.105 --> 28:12.148
YOU COULD PICK
ANY T-SHIRT YOU WANT.

28:12.232 --> 28:15.860
- 'SUP, PAL?

28:15.944 --> 28:19.781

JUST LIKE A BUS ROUTE.

28:19.864 --> 28:20.907

28:25.703 --> 28:28.289
IF SHE FUCKS RONNIE,
IT'S LIKE GUIDO BINGO.

28:28.373 --> 28:34.087
- I DON'T LIKE SLOPPY 23rds.

28:34.170 --> 28:35.755
- 'SUP, BRO?

28:35.839 --> 28:39.134

[hums funeral dirge]

29:08.246 --> 29:13.334

29:13.418 --> 29:14.836
- WHAT'S HAPPENING, BUDDY?

29:14.919 --> 29:16.921
- THAT KID HAS TO BE ONE OF
THE NICEST KIDS I'VE EVER MET.

29:17.005 --> 29:18.173
- YEAH, HE'S A GOOD KID.

29:18.256 --> 29:20.675
- COME ON. THEY'RE TRYING
TO FUCK WITH ME.

29:20.758 --> 29:24.512
- I'M GONNA GO HAVE A CIGARETTE.
TRY TO BE NICE WHILE I'M GONE.

29:24.596 --> 29:25.722
LET ME KNOW IF SHE
SAYS ANYTHING TO YOU...

29:25.805 --> 29:27.849
I MEAN,
GIVES YOU PERMISSION...

29:27.932 --> 29:29.559
- I MEAN, I WANT AN APOLOGY.
I DO WANT AN APOLOGY.

29:29.642 --> 29:32.353
- I NEVER GET MIKE.

29:32.437 --> 29:33.521
I DON'T KNOW
WHO HE'S TRYING TO BE TODAY.

29:33.605 --> 29:35.023
IS HE GONNA BE
THE NICE GUY,

29:35.106 --> 29:37.525
OR IS HE GONNA BE THE
DICKHEAD THAT'S TRYING TO,

29:37.609 --> 29:38.526
YOU KNOW,
FUCK SHIT UP?

29:38.610 --> 29:40.153
I DON'T LIKE YOUR FRIEND.

29:40.236 --> 29:42.363
- YOU WERE ME--YOU WERE ME--
YOU WERE MEAN TO HIM LAST NIGHT.

29:42.447 --> 29:43.531
- I DON'T LIKE HIM.
HE'S A DICK.

29:43.615 --> 29:45.867
- I KNOW, BUT YOU SAID
SOME PRETTY MEAN THINGS.

29:45.950 --> 29:49.496
- WELL, SHIT,
HE PISSED ME OFF LAST NIGHT.

29:49.579 --> 29:50.580
- BUT YOU DEFINITELY SAID

29:50.663 --> 29:51.873
SOME PRETTY MEAN THINGS
TO HIM LAST NIGHT.

29:51.956 --> 29:53.500
HE'S ACTUALLY
A LITTLE UPSET.

29:53.583 --> 29:54.876
YOU SHOULD APOLOGIZE,

29:54.959 --> 29:57.837
'CAUSE THE INGREDIENTS
OF THE BOMB ARE HERE RIGHT NOW.

29:57.921 --> 30:01.883
I MEAN, NICOLE HAS GOT
TO BEND JON RIGHT NOW,

30:01.966 --> 30:04.344
'CAUSE SHE KNOWS
JON'S GOT HER.

30:04.427 --> 30:06.513
- WHERE YOU GOING?
- I WANNA SEE SOMETHING.

30:06.596 --> 30:09.140
- WHAT'S UP, SNOOKI?

30:09.224 --> 30:10.600
- I'M SORRY
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

30:10.683 --> 30:12.477
- I DON'T--
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT APOLOGY.

30:12.560 --> 30:13.561
- I DIDN'T
MEAN IT LAST NIGHT.

30:13.645 --> 30:16.564
I WAS DRUNK,
AND I WAS JUST A LUNATIC.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.608
I'M SORRY.

30:18.691 --> 30:19.567
- YOU KNOW,
PEOPLE GET OUT OF LINE,

30:19.651 --> 30:20.860
AND THEY SAY
THE WRONG THINGS,

30:20.944 --> 30:22.403
AND SOMETIMES
IT GETS 'EM IN TROUBLE.

30:22.487 --> 30:23.905
- WHAT, SO YOU'RE GONNA
DO SOMETHING BACK TO ME

30:23.988 --> 30:26.407
BECAUSE I GOT DRUNK AND SAID
SOMETHING STUPID TO YOU?

30:26.491 --> 30:28.910
- NO, I--
- I'M APOLOGIZING TO YOU.

30:28.993 --> 30:30.036
I DON'T LIKE TO APOLOGIZE.
THAT'S NOT ME.

30:30.119 --> 30:31.412
- WHAT'S NOT YOU?

30:31.496 --> 30:34.415
- APOLOGIZING
AND ADMITTING THAT I'M WRONG.

30:34.499 --> 30:36.167
- BUT IT IS YOU JUST, LIKE,
GOING OFF ON SOMEBODY

30:36.251 --> 30:37.627
FOR NO APPARENT REASON?

30:37.710 --> 30:39.254
IS THAT YOU?
- WHEN I'M DRUNK, YES.

30:39.337 --> 30:40.588
MIKE KNOWS.

30:40.672 --> 30:47.095
I HAVE A LITTLE BIT
OF ANGER ISSUES. I'M SORRY.

30:47.178 --> 30:48.763
- ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT.
APOLOGY'S THE FIRST STEP.

30:48.846 --> 30:50.682
I'LL TAKE THAT
AS A FIRST STEP.

30:50.765 --> 30:52.517
- I APOLOGIZED TO UNIT,

30:52.600 --> 30:53.935
BUT I DON'T GIVE
A FUCK ABOUT UNIT.

30:54.018 --> 30:55.520
I ONLY DID IT BECAUSE MIKE'S--
YOU KNOW, TOLD ME TO.

30:55.603 --> 30:56.896
- TAKE IT FOR WHAT IT IS.

30:56.980 --> 30:59.607
I'M A NICE DUDE.
- I KNOW YOU ARE.

30:59.691 --> 31:02.819
- I'M SO SURPRISED
THAT SHE APOLOGIZED.

31:02.902 --> 31:04.362
AND THAT WAS
A GOOD MOVE BY HER.

31:04.445 --> 31:07.073
IF WE DO SOMETHING NOW,
IT'S GONNA MAKE US LOOK BAD.

31:07.156 --> 31:09.117
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
BUT WE GOT THE WHOLE SUMMER.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.411
SO WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

31:11.494 --> 31:13.913
- THIS BITCH HAS SOME GAME.
- YEAH, SHE DOES.

31:13.997 --> 31:16.541
- GUIDOS ARE HERE.
- RYDER!

31:16.624 --> 31:18.334
DID YOU GUYS MAKE BABIES?
- YEAH, BUDDY.

31:18.418 --> 31:19.210
- WE GOT TO GO, SO.

31:19.294 --> 31:20.962
- LOVE YOU, KID.
- SEE YOU, DOG.

31:21.045 --> 31:22.463
- I LOVE YOU.
- LOVE YOU.

31:22.547 --> 31:24.632
- SEE YOU LATER.
- GUYS TALK TONIGHT.

31:38.229 --> 31:42.900
- I'VE BEEN AWAY FROM MY FAMILY
FOR A LONG TIME NOW,

31:42.984 --> 31:44.819
AND I'M A LITTLE HOMESICK.

31:44.902 --> 31:46.946
[clears throat]
I DON'T KNOW.

31:47.030 --> 31:47.989
IT'S--IT'S A WEIRD
KIND OF FEELING.

31:48.072 --> 31:50.158
SEEING MY MOTHER
LAST NIGHT,

31:50.241 --> 31:52.493
IT KIND OF LIKE, MAKES IT
A LITTLE WORSE I FEEL.

31:52.577 --> 31:55.330
[children shouting]

31:55.413 --> 31:57.832
- 'SUP, BRO?
- WHAT UP?

31:57.915 --> 32:01.502
- ALL RIGHT?
- NO, I FEEL LIKE SHIT.

32:01.586 --> 32:02.712
- WHAT'S WRONG?

32:02.795 --> 32:07.425
- MY FAMILY.

32:07.508 --> 32:09.594
- DEPRESSED?

32:09.677 --> 32:12.096
- YEAH.
AT THIS POINT, YEAH.

32:12.180 --> 32:14.682
- WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY?

32:14.766 --> 32:16.225
KNOW WHAT I MEAN,
SOMETHING THAT MAKES YOU HAPPY.

32:16.309 --> 32:18.353
- SEEING MY FAMILY,
YOU KNOW, FOR REAL.

32:18.436 --> 32:19.228
NOT SEEING THEM OVER HERE.

32:19.312 --> 32:20.647
- YEAH, FOR ONE NIGHT.
I KNOW.

32:20.730 --> 32:22.607
- LIKE, I NEED...

32:22.690 --> 32:26.819
LIKE, I--I NEED AN ESCAPE.
YOU KNOW?

32:26.903 --> 32:28.905
- I THINK THE FACT
THAT VINNY IS SO TAKEN CARE OF

32:28.988 --> 32:31.157
AT HOME BY HIS MOM,
THAT'S AFFECTING HIM A LOT.

32:31.240 --> 32:32.283
"I'M HUNGRY,"
HIS MOM COOKS HIM DINNER.

32:32.367 --> 32:34.577
"I'M DIRTY,"
HIS MOM WIPES HIS ASS.

32:34.661 --> 32:37.038
I DON'T KNOW, I THINK VINNY
NEEDS TO KIND OF MAN UP

32:37.121 --> 32:38.164
AND, LIKE, MOVE ON.

32:38.247 --> 32:41.000
WANT ME
TO GET YOU A STRIPPER?

I WAS ONLY GONNA STAY IN AZTEC
IF IT'S REALLY GOOD,

34:24.228 --> 34:25.813
AND AZTEC IS JUST NOT GOOD.

34:25.897 --> 34:27.482

LIKE, I DON'T WANT
ANYBODY IN A FUNK.

34:43.831 --> 34:45.833
BECAUSE THEIR FUNK
PUTS ME IN A FUNK

34:45.917 --> 34:47.043
BECAUSE THEY'RE IN A FUNK,

34:47.126 --> 34:48.293
AND I DON'T WANT
ANYBODY TO BE IN A FUNK.

34:48.377 --> 34:49.962
IS VINNY OKAY?

34:50.045 --> 34:52.172
- HE'S TIRED.

34:52.255 --> 34:55.676
- MY MAN VINNY'S NOT FEELING IT,
SO BROS BEFORE HOS.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.011
THAT'S MY BOY,
SO I'M GONNA LEAVE WITH HIM.

34:57.094 --> 34:59.847
WHY YOU LOOK SO MAD?

34:59.931 --> 35:02.016

I WOULD'VE STAYED, BUT...

35:04.519 --> 35:06.729
- WANNA GO BACK HOME?

TO GET SOME SLEEP TONIGHT.

35:09.857 --> 35:10.775
WANNA DO THAT?

35:10.858 --> 35:14.612

35:14.695 --> 35:18.533
AT THIS POINT, LIKE,
I'M REALLY IN A WEIRD PLACE.

35:18.616 --> 35:19.826
I'M SAD, I'M ANXIOUS,

35:19.909 --> 35:23.830
I'M STRESSED,
I'M HYPER, I'M TIRED,

35:23.913 --> 35:26.707
AND I NEED SLEEP.

SO FAR ON FUMES, YOU KNOW.

35:39.095 --> 35:41.180

A SHOT OR NO?

35:41.264 --> 35:43.683

35:43.766 --> 35:46.644
I SEE JIONNI AT THE BAR,
AND RIGHT AWAY,

35:46.727 --> 35:48.062
HE'S LIKE,
"MIKE, LET ME GET YOU A DRINK."

35:48.145 --> 35:52.066
AND I'M LIKE, "ALL RIGHT, COOL.
I'LL TAKE A DRINK."

35:52.149 --> 35:53.526
- CHEERS.

35:53.609 --> 35:55.695

35:55.778 --> 35:59.198
- NEXT THING YOU KNOW IT, LIKE,
HE'S BUYING ME DRINKS ALL NIGHT.

35:59.282 --> 36:02.410
"MIKE, YOU WANT A DRINK?"
"SURE."

36:02.493 --> 36:05.580
"MIKE, YOU WANT A SHOT?"
"SURE, OKAY."

36:05.663 --> 36:08.124
AND I'M THINKING IN THE BACK
OF MY HEAD, LIKE, WOW, DUDE.

36:08.207 --> 36:09.584

36:19.886 --> 36:22.555
- MIKE'S A NICE GUY.
- HUH?

36:22.638 --> 36:25.016
- MIKE'S NICE TO ME.

36:25.099 --> 36:28.185
- IT'S REALLY WEIRD TO SEE MIKE,
LIKE, BUDDY BUDDY WITH JIONNI

36:28.269 --> 36:31.439
BECAUSE LAST NIGHT HE TRIED
TO BREAK ME AND JIONNI UP.

36:31.522 --> 36:35.026
YOU THINK MIKE'S NICE,
BUT IT'S JUST NOT REAL.

36:35.109 --> 36:36.903
- I'VE MET HIM TWICE,
HE CAME UP TO ME.

36:36.986 --> 36:38.070
HE GOES, "BRO, YOU'RE THE NICEST
GUY I'VE EVER MET."

36:38.154 --> 36:41.032
- WHY DOES EVERYONE
SAY THAT TO YOU?

36:41.115 --> 36:42.199
YOU'RE NOT THAT NICE.

36:42.283 --> 36:44.118
- I SWEAR TO GOD,
HE SAID IT TWICE.

36:44.201 --> 36:45.620
- WATCH MY BACK
WITH MIKE AND YOU.

36:45.703 --> 36:48.706
- WHY?

36:48.789 --> 36:50.625
- HE'S GONNA TRY
AND, LIKE, BE SHADY.

36:50.708 --> 36:52.376
- TO ME?

37:08.726 --> 37:10.519

LIKE, ALL RIGHT,
LET ME GO UP THERE

AND SEEING THE FAMILY KIND OF
SPARKED IT A LITTLE BIT.

37:48.099 --> 37:50.476
SO HE'S IN THIS CRAZY FUNK.

37:50.559 --> 37:53.938
