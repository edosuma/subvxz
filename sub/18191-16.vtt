WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.604
PREVIOUSLY ON
"CHASING LIFE..."

00:03.637 --> 00:05.004
- ( reporters clamor)
- I'M DYING

00:05.038 --> 00:06.607
AND THE ONLY CURE
IS AN INTERVIEW WITH YOU.

00:08.041 --> 00:09.410
( chuckles )

00:09.442 --> 00:11.278
YOU REPORTERS ARE CRAZY,
YOU KNOW THAT?

00:11.311 --> 00:14.281
I DON'T THINK SHE'S DRUNK.
DID YOU PUT SOMETHING
IN HER DRINK?

00:14.314 --> 00:15.583
YOU THINK I DRUGGED HER?

00:15.615 --> 00:17.050
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT
WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT

00:17.083 --> 00:18.352
WHEN WE DECIDED

00:18.385 --> 00:19.519
THE GIRLS SHOULD
STOP SEEING EACH OTHER.

00:19.553 --> 00:21.054
DON'T YOU HAVE CLASS?

00:21.088 --> 00:22.455
I DON'T FEEL LIKE GOING.

00:22.489 --> 00:24.658
NOW THAT I'M NOT DEAD,
I HAVE NO IDEA

00:24.692 --> 00:27.027
WHAT I'M GONNA DO
WITH THE REST OF MY LIFE.

00:27.060 --> 00:28.696
YOU WANT A SAD CANCER STORY?

00:28.728 --> 00:30.564
EITHER YOU DELIVER
THE STORY I ASK FOR

00:30.597 --> 00:32.098
OR YOU GO BACK
TO RESEARCH DUTY.

00:33.334 --> 00:35.603
- ( phones ring )
- ( chattering )

00:39.372 --> 00:41.542
HEY, I'M JULIAN.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.076
HI, JULIAN.

00:43.109 --> 00:44.512
- I'M AP--
- APRIL CARVER.

00:44.545 --> 00:47.715
I'VE SEEN YOU AT
THE NORTH END SUPPORT GROUP
A COUPLE TIMES.

00:47.747 --> 00:49.450
YOU, OBVIOUSLY,
HAVEN'T NOTICED ME.

00:49.482 --> 00:51.051
I WON'T TAKE OFFENSE.

00:51.085 --> 00:53.320
AND, UH, I'VE READ
SOME OF YOUR ARTICLES
FOR THE "POST."

00:53.353 --> 00:55.588
THAT'S AN INTERESTING
PERSPECTIVE.

00:55.622 --> 00:58.459
WOW, THANK YOU.
THAT MEANS A LOT.

00:58.491 --> 01:00.493
SO, UH... CAN I
TAKE YOU OUT SOMETIME?

01:01.594 --> 01:03.430
UH-- SORRY.

01:03.463 --> 01:05.832
THAT'S REALLY SWEET,
BUT I'M SORT OF
DATING SOMEONE.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.301
OKAY, I GOT IT.

01:08.335 --> 01:10.236
I CAN'T SAY I'M SURPRISED.

01:10.271 --> 01:12.472
- ( chuckles )
- SO YOU'RE IN FOR
LEUKEMIA, RIGHT?

01:12.506 --> 01:14.340
YEAH. YOU?

01:14.375 --> 01:16.075
UH, NUT CANCER.

01:16.109 --> 01:18.311
YEAH, KIDS CAN GET IT TOO.

01:19.612 --> 01:21.682
OH MY GOD,
I'M SO SORRY.
THAT'S...

01:21.715 --> 01:24.819
HUMILIATING?
YEAH, I-- I KNOW.

01:24.852 --> 01:27.688
- Nurse: APRIL CARVER?
- Sara: OH, I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

01:27.721 --> 01:29.522
- I LOST MY KEYS.
- THAT'S OKAY,

01:29.557 --> 01:30.591
THEY JUST CALLED ME.

01:30.623 --> 01:32.192
YOU'RE MOM COMES
TO YOUR CHECKUPS?

01:32.225 --> 01:33.760
YEAH, DOESN'T YOURS?

01:33.793 --> 01:35.563
( scoffs )

01:35.596 --> 01:37.364
NO.

01:46.706 --> 01:48.741
( sighs )
STILL CANCER FREE.

01:48.776 --> 01:50.510
( both laugh )

01:50.543 --> 01:51.512
WHEW!

01:51.545 --> 01:52.847
TWO WHOLE MONTHS
SINCE CHEMO

01:52.879 --> 01:54.247
AND IT HASN'T COME BACK.

01:54.281 --> 01:55.281
IT'S GOT TO MEAN
SOMETHING, RIGHT?

01:55.316 --> 01:56.783
IT MEANS
WE'RE STILL IN REMISSION.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.885
- ( sighs )
- OKAY, LET'S GET
OUT OF HERE.

01:59.118 --> 02:01.322
YEAH, YOU'RE BORING ME
WITH THESE STABLE BLOOD COUNTS.

02:01.355 --> 02:02.656
GIVE ME SOME REAL WORK
TO DO.

02:02.689 --> 02:04.358
OH, ACTUALLY, DR. HAMBURG,
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

02:05.558 --> 02:09.362
- UM, PRIVATELY?
- OH, UH, I'LL BE OUTSIDE.

02:14.868 --> 02:17.771
WELL, I JUST DIDN'T
WANT TO ASK YOU THIS
IN FRONT OF MY MOM.

02:17.805 --> 02:20.473
- BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT SEX.
- HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

02:20.508 --> 02:22.877
I'VE BEEN
DOING THIS A WHILE.
WHAT'S UP?

02:22.909 --> 02:25.346
UM, WELL...

02:25.378 --> 02:26.780
LEO AND I HAVEN'T
REALLY DONE IT

02:26.813 --> 02:28.181
SINCE BEFORE TREATMENT.

02:28.215 --> 02:29.650
- SO...
- WELL, STUDIES SHOW

02:29.682 --> 02:31.551
THAT CHEMO AND COMAS
CAN DO THAT TO A COUPLE.

02:31.585 --> 02:32.786
( chuckles )

02:32.819 --> 02:34.587
WELL, NOW WE WANT TO,

02:34.622 --> 02:35.855
SO I GUESS I WAS
JUST WONDERING

02:35.889 --> 02:37.358
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT.

02:37.390 --> 02:39.560
LIKE I KNOW I HAD
FERTILITY TREATMENTS,

02:39.593 --> 02:41.295
BECAUSE CHEMO
MAKES PEOPLE INFERTILE,

02:41.328 --> 02:43.364
- BUT DOES THAT MEANT THAT--
- JUST SOME PEOPLE.

02:43.396 --> 02:44.564
I WOULD STILL USE PROTECTION.

02:44.598 --> 02:46.533
OF COURSE,
BUT OTHER THAN THAT,

02:46.567 --> 02:49.203
ANY MEDICAL RISKS
I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT?

02:49.235 --> 02:50.503
WELL, THIS FAR OUT OF CHEMO
THE ONLY RISK

02:50.538 --> 02:51.938
WOULD BE A LOSS
OF SEX DRIVE.

02:52.171 --> 02:53.439
BUT IF YOU'RE TELLING ME
YOU GOT YOUR GROOVE BACK,

02:53.473 --> 02:55.241
THEN I SAY, "GO FOR IT."

02:56.242 --> 02:57.777
GREAT, THANK YOU.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.717
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

03:04.752 --> 03:08.322
OH, I WAS JUST ASKING
HOW IT'S GOING

03:08.354 --> 03:09.657
WITH THE NEW GUY
SHE'S DATING.

03:09.689 --> 03:11.724
ISN'T DR. HAMBURG MARRIED?

03:11.759 --> 03:13.860
- YEAH.
- ( gasps )

03:13.894 --> 03:16.597
IS SHE CHEATING
ON HER HUSBAND?

03:18.632 --> 03:20.199
YEAH.

03:20.234 --> 03:21.534
( exhales )

03:21.568 --> 03:23.403
SHE'S LIKE THE HEARTBREAKER
OF MASS MEDICAL.

03:23.437 --> 03:25.739
THIS PLACE IS TOTALLY
"GREY'S ANATOMY."

03:26.774 --> 03:28.609
( sighs, clicks tongue )

03:34.381 --> 03:37.685
- ( theme music playing )
- ♪ YOU BET YOUR SOUL, HONEY ♪

03:37.718 --> 03:40.521
♪ YOU BET YOUR SOUL ♪

03:40.554 --> 03:45.359
♪ JUST RIGHT ♪

03:45.391 --> 03:50.463
♪ YOU COULD STAY ALL NIGHT
AND NEVER WANNA GO HOME ♪

03:50.497 --> 03:52.466
♪ 'CAUSE WE CAN'T STOP ♪

03:52.498 --> 03:53.866
♪ WE WON'T STOP. ♪

03:55.703 --> 03:58.004
IT'S LIKE THE SECOND
SHE SAID I WAS STILL
IN REMISSION,

03:58.237 --> 03:59.506
SHE FLIPPED A SWITCH.

03:59.539 --> 04:01.307
I HAVE SO MUCH ENERGY.

04:01.342 --> 04:02.543
I WANT TO KICK ASS AT WORK.

04:02.575 --> 04:03.978
AND DID I TELL YOU
SHE SAID I CAN HAVE SEX?

04:04.010 --> 04:06.580
YES, IT'S THE FIRST THING
YOU TOLD ME LAST NIGHT...

04:06.614 --> 04:08.748
- AND TODAY.
- SORRY.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.584
IT'S JUST EVER SINCE
LEO AND I GOT OUT
OF THE HOSPITAL,

04:10.617 --> 04:11.985
WE HAVEN'T HAD
ANY PRIVACY.

04:12.019 --> 04:13.353
HE'S GOT THAT
LIVE-IN NURSE

04:13.387 --> 04:15.622
AND MY FAMILY'S
ALWAYS AROUND.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.358
IT'S JUST NOW THAT
I KNOW IT'S OKAY,

04:17.391 --> 04:18.925
I AM LIKE,
"BRING IT ON!"

04:18.959 --> 04:20.360
OKAY, WELL, GOOD,

04:20.394 --> 04:21.862
'CAUSE I BROUGHT YOU
THESE CONDOMS.

04:21.894 --> 04:23.297
MORGAN LEFT THEM
AT THE APARTMENT

04:23.329 --> 04:24.831
WHEN SHE MOVED.

04:24.865 --> 04:25.966
DUDE.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.434
YEAH, SHE LOVES COSTCO.

04:27.468 --> 04:28.836
WHY CAN'T YOU
USE THEM?

04:28.869 --> 04:31.437
HMM, GRAHAM'S
ALLERGIC TO LATEX.

04:31.471 --> 04:32.740
OH, HOW DELICATE.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.507
WHAT DO
YOU GUYS USE,
FLOWER PETALS?

04:34.540 --> 04:36.476
- SILK SCARVES?
- UH, I HATE YOU.

04:36.509 --> 04:37.911
- ( chuckles )
- HERE.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.680
YOU'RE WELCOME,
BY THE WAY.

04:39.713 --> 04:40.980
THAT'S NOT GONNA FIT.

04:41.014 --> 04:42.915
( snickers, laughing )

04:42.949 --> 04:44.018
SORRY.

04:44.050 --> 04:46.653
INSERT
SEX JOKE HERE.

04:46.687 --> 04:47.887
( laughing )
INSERT!

04:47.920 --> 04:49.889
WOW, YEAH,
YOU'RE OUT OF CONTROL.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.457
ALL RIGHT.

04:51.492 --> 04:55.362
- ALL RIGHT.
- ( laughing harder )

04:55.396 --> 04:56.963
IT'S REALLY HARD
TO GET THESE IN HERE.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.665
"HARD!"

05:00.367 --> 05:02.970
Ford:
OKAY, NEW GAME.

05:03.002 --> 05:05.305
LET'S START WITH...
SNEAKER-WEDGE GIRL.

05:06.639 --> 05:08.675

05:08.709 --> 05:10.610
WHAT ABOUT HIPPIE GIRL?

05:10.644 --> 05:12.379
- ME.
- HER.

05:12.413 --> 05:13.747
YOU WANT TO LOOK LIKE
YOU DON'T BATHE?

05:13.781 --> 05:15.783
SHE'S STILL REALLY PRETTY.

05:15.815 --> 05:17.451
OOH, PURPLE HAIR,

05:17.483 --> 05:19.319
SHE MUST BE NEW.

05:19.353 --> 05:21.754
- I'D RATHER LOOK LIKE HER.
- YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE HER FACE.

05:21.788 --> 05:23.624
YEAH, BUT I CAN ALREADY TELL
THAT SHE'S A BADASS.

05:25.059 --> 05:27.494
- ( chuckles )
- OH. OKAY, WAIT.

05:27.528 --> 05:30.029
SO IS THIS FOR, LIKE,
A TENNIS MATCH?

05:30.064 --> 05:31.699
'CAUSE, LIKE, PURPLE'S
LIKE OUR SCHOOL COLOR?

05:31.731 --> 05:34.534
OUR SCHOOL COLORS
ARE MAROON AND GREY.

05:34.567 --> 05:37.071
- OH.
- I JUST FELT
LIKE A CHANGE.

05:38.504 --> 05:39.605
ARE YOUR PARENTS
FREAKING OUT?

05:39.639 --> 05:41.375
THEY'VE BEEN OUT OF TOWN.

05:41.408 --> 05:43.377
I FIGURE IF THEY'RE GONNA
BE OUT OF MY LIFE THIS MUCH,

05:43.409 --> 05:44.745
THEN THEY DON'T
REALLY GET A SAY.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.880
( bell rings )

06:10.637 --> 06:11.939
( panicked )
MORNING.

06:14.475 --> 06:16.810
( phone ringing )

06:20.480 --> 06:21.949
COOL RING TONE.

06:21.981 --> 06:23.649
NOW ANSWER IT.

06:23.684 --> 06:24.884
THERE'S NO SERVICE
IN HERE.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.052
BUT IT'S RINGING.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.487
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

06:27.521 --> 06:28.788
IF I PICK IT UP,
WE'RE JUST GONNA GET CUT OFF.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.790
IF YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING
'CAUSE IT'S LEO,

06:30.824 --> 06:31.925
THIS ONLY
MAKES IT WEIRDER.

06:31.959 --> 06:32.925
I DON'T KNOW WHO'S CALLING.

06:32.959 --> 06:35.028
( ringing continues )

06:35.062 --> 06:36.463
WHAT IF IT'S AN EMERGENCY?

06:36.497 --> 06:37.764
WHAT IF YOUR IDENTITY WAS
STOLEN?

06:37.798 --> 06:38.798
WHAT IF YOUR WHOLE FAMILY

06:38.831 --> 06:40.033
WAS ABDUCTED BY KIDNAPPERS

06:40.067 --> 06:41.435
WHO GAVE THEM ONE PHONE CALL
BEFORE THEY

06:41.468 --> 06:42.668
WERE ALL BURIED ALIVE
AND THEY PICKED YOU,

06:42.702 --> 06:43.670
BUT YOU DIDN'T EVEN
ANSWER YOUR PHONE?

06:43.704 --> 06:45.038
( elevator dings )

06:46.439 --> 06:47.807
YOUR WHOLE FAMILY'S DEAD.

06:51.577 --> 06:53.646
MY TACOS!

06:53.680 --> 06:55.048
HOW LONG WAS THE LINE
AT THE TRUCK, JOSHY?

06:55.081 --> 06:56.783
OH, LIKE, TWO HOURS.

06:56.817 --> 06:58.985
THAT'S CRAZY.
WHERE'S MY CHANGE?

06:59.019 --> 07:01.487
I DIDN'T GET ANY CHANGE.

07:01.521 --> 07:03.055
OKAY, OKAY.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.423
UM, HERE YOU GO.
HERE YOU GO.

07:04.458 --> 07:07.026
I'LL FORGIVE YOUR DEBT

07:07.060 --> 07:09.163
IF YOU DO 20 PUSHUPS
WITHOUT STOPPING.

07:09.196 --> 07:11.031
AND NOT GIRL PUSHUPS. GO.

07:16.435 --> 07:18.538
THIS ISN'T
A FITNESS CENTER.

07:18.572 --> 07:20.072
UH-- UH-- I KNOW,
BUT HE--

07:20.106 --> 07:21.841
NO, YOUR KNEE
TOUCHED THE GROUND.
START OVER.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.644
THIS ISN'T HOW
WE USE OUR INTERNS.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.545
HEY, GO MAKE SOME
COPIES OR SOMETHING.

07:25.579 --> 07:26.879
OKAY.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.552
BY THE WAY, I'M GETTING
SCOOP ON RICHIE MIRANDA.

07:31.584 --> 07:34.053
YEAH, HIS CONTRACT'S UP SOON.
I'M HEARING TRADE RUMORS.

07:34.086 --> 07:36.023

07:36.055 --> 07:38.792
OWNS THE NEWBURY HOUSE.
IT'S A NEW-MEMBERS CLUB.

07:38.826 --> 07:40.159
IT'S HAVING A GRAND OPENING
TOMORROW NIGHT.

07:40.194 --> 07:42.028
AND I KNOW RICHIE'S
GONNA BE THERE TO HELP
HIS BUDDY OUT.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.764
- SO--
- I KNOW-- SORRY.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.533
I KNOW RICHIE MIRANDA.
HE'S GIVEN ME SCOOP BEFORE.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.067
I WAS ACTUALLY HIS FIRST
INTERVIEW OUT OF REHAB,

07:48.100 --> 07:49.468
SO I'M SURE
HE'D REMEMBER ME.

07:49.502 --> 07:51.672
- I COULD TALK TO HIM.
- BUT HE'S SPORTS,

07:51.704 --> 07:54.007
- AND YOU'RE CANCER.
- AARON, I'M NOT LIKE

07:54.040 --> 07:55.242
"CANCER GIRL."

07:55.475 --> 07:57.211
WELL, YOU'RE NOT
"SPORTS GIRL."

07:57.244 --> 07:59.947
NO, BUT I AM
A GOOD JOURNALIST.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.180
AND I'D BE
A REAL ASSET TO THE STORY.

08:01.214 --> 08:02.882
OKAY, OKAY.
DOESN'T MATTER.

08:02.915 --> 08:04.651
IT'S UP TO CAREY
IF HE WANTS YOUR HELP.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.485
CAREY, DO YOU WANT
APRIL TO HELP?

08:06.519 --> 08:07.653
NOPE.

08:09.189 --> 08:10.490
CAN YOU MAKE
A FRESH POT?

08:18.564 --> 08:20.132
SO, UM,

08:20.167 --> 08:22.702
MY MOM IS TAKING BRENNA
TO THE MOVIES TONIGHT.

08:24.605 --> 08:25.939
I'M SORRY, IS THAT
CODE FOR SOMETHING?

08:25.973 --> 08:27.940
YEAH, IT MEANS
THEY WON'T BE HOME

08:27.975 --> 08:29.709
AND GRANDMA'S AT
HER HIGH SCHOOL REUNION,

08:29.742 --> 08:31.879
SO WE'LL BE ALONE.

08:31.911 --> 08:34.847
- WE SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE.
- OOH, YEAH, WE SHOULD.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.551
JUST TO BE CLEAR,
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

08:37.584 --> 08:39.552
PRANK PHONE CALLS
AND RAIDING THE FRIDGE,

08:39.586 --> 08:40.586
STUFF LIKE THAT, RIGHT?

08:40.620 --> 08:41.754
HM-MMM.

08:41.788 --> 08:43.123
HEY, THAT'S THE KID
FROM THE HOSPITAL,

08:43.155 --> 08:45.625
THE ONE WHO ASKED ME OUT.

08:45.658 --> 08:47.927
- April: HEY, JULIAN.
- HI.

08:47.961 --> 08:50.864
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
HE WAS YOUR BOYFRIEND.

08:50.898 --> 08:52.899
OH, DON'T WORRY.
HE'S STILL IN P.T.

08:52.932 --> 08:54.167
WAY TOO WEAK
TO KICK YOUR ASS.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.669
OH, HONEY, YOU SAY
THE SWEETEST THINGS.

08:56.702 --> 08:58.272
IT'S OKAY.
SEE, I'VE MOVED ON.

08:58.304 --> 09:00.240
SHE'S JUST
ONE OF THE MANY GIRLS
I'VE ASKED OUT LATELY.

09:00.274 --> 09:03.076
WHEN I GOT DIAGNOSED,
I DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE
ANY REGRETS,

09:03.110 --> 09:04.677
SO I MADE A RULE.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.779
EVERY TIME I SEE A GIRL
THAT I THINK IS CUTE,

09:06.812 --> 09:08.115
I'LL ASK HER OUT.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.249
SEVEN GIRLS SO FAR.

09:09.283 --> 09:11.284
HAVE ANY SAID "YES"?

09:11.317 --> 09:13.720
NO.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.589
BUT, UH, YOU KNOW
WHAT MIGHT HELP?

09:15.621 --> 09:18.759
IF I WAS FEATURED
IN YOUR CANCER COLUMN.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.293
April: UH...

09:20.326 --> 09:22.296
YOU WANT ME
TO WRITE A STORY
ABOUT YOU?

09:22.328 --> 09:23.764
WELL, COULD YOU?

09:23.797 --> 09:26.099
I MEAN, GIRLS WOULD
DEFINITELY START SAYING YES.

09:26.133 --> 09:27.900
I'LL RUN IT
BY MY BOSS.

09:27.934 --> 09:30.703
OKAY, UH, OH,
IF YOU THINK IT'LL HELP,

09:30.736 --> 09:32.205
I'LL TEXT YOU A PICTURE OF ME
DURING CHEMO.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.740
THE BALD HEAD
GOES A LONG WAY.

09:35.341 --> 09:36.710
HM.

09:40.346 --> 09:42.081
I KNOW YOU GUYS
ALREADY ATE,

09:42.115 --> 09:44.051
- BUT THIS CURRY
IS SO GOOD.
- YEAH!

09:44.084 --> 09:46.052
- YEAH, WE ARE GONNA TRY IT.
- I CAN'T STOP EATING IT.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.754
IT'S GOOD. YOU SHOULD--
YOU GUYS SHOULD PROBABLY
GO TO YOUR MOVIE.

09:48.788 --> 09:50.090
THE MOVIE DOESN'T
START TILL 8:10.

09:50.123 --> 09:52.692
YEAH, BUT THE SHOWCASE
HAS BEEN SO CROWDED LATELY.

09:52.725 --> 09:54.794
I WANT TO MAKE SURE
YOU GUYS GET TO SIT
TOGETHER,

09:54.827 --> 09:56.897
- SO I WILL GET THE DISHWASHER.
- REALLY?

09:56.929 --> 09:58.764
- YOU GO. YEAH.
- OKAY.

09:58.798 --> 10:00.000
- MY PHONE--
- OH, YOU DON'T NEED IT.

10:00.033 --> 10:01.134
YOU CAN'T TALK
IN THE MOVIES, ANYWAYS.

10:01.168 --> 10:02.903
THAT'S TRUE, OKAY.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.937
- BYE.
- BYE.

10:04.971 --> 10:06.773
ARE YOU ON STEROIDS?

10:06.807 --> 10:07.975
YEAH, ACTUALLY I AM.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.342
OKAY, WELL, I WAS
TRYING TO MAKE A JOKE

10:09.375 --> 10:10.677
- ABOUT YOU BEING HYPER.
- WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

10:10.711 --> 10:12.011
- COME ON.
- ALL RIGHT.

10:13.346 --> 10:14.347
WHOA!

10:14.380 --> 10:16.750
OH, OH, OH.

10:16.783 --> 10:17.951
OKAY.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.219
OH, WE PLAYING DOCTOR NOW?

10:20.787 --> 10:22.088
ACTUALLY, WE BOTH HAD CANCER.

10:22.121 --> 10:23.956
THAT'S NOT REALLY FUNNY.
WE SHOULDN'T JOKE ABOUT THAT.

10:23.990 --> 10:25.725
LET'S DO IT.

10:27.793 --> 10:29.363
- HOW MANY TIMES?
- YOU TELL ME.

10:29.395 --> 10:30.730
OKAY.

10:30.764 --> 10:31.898
OH.

10:48.881 --> 10:50.317
( whispering )
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.385
I FEEL LIKE I'M
BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL.

10:52.418 --> 10:55.221
DOESN'T YOUR MOM ASSUME
THAT WE'RE SLEEPING TOGETHER?

10:55.254 --> 10:57.090
- YOU'RE 24.
- ( whispering )
WELL, SHE DOES.

10:57.124 --> 10:59.893
THAT'S ACTUALLY THE PROBLEM.
SHE'S A THERAPIST.

10:59.926 --> 11:02.863
- SHE'S WAY TOO COMFORTABLE
TALKING ABOUT SEX.
- ( creaking )

11:02.895 --> 11:06.265
IT'S JUST REALLY
AWKWARD TO TALK ABOUT THAT
WITH YOUR MOM, YOU KNOW?

11:09.836 --> 11:10.836
COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON.

11:10.870 --> 11:11.937
( stairs creak )

11:11.971 --> 11:13.306
Sara:
HONEY, IS THAT YOU?

11:13.340 --> 11:15.107
( approaching footsteps )

11:15.142 --> 11:17.144
OH, LEO, HI.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.312
YEAH, UH...

11:19.346 --> 11:21.313
WE JUST FELL ASLEEP
LAST NIGHT.

11:21.347 --> 11:22.716
WE WERE LISTENING
TO MUSIC

11:22.749 --> 11:24.717
IN MY ROOM
AND IT GOT REALLY LATE.

11:24.750 --> 11:26.452
AND WE WOKE UP THIS MORNING,

11:26.686 --> 11:28.321
AND WE'RE LIKE,
"WOW, IT'S MORNING."

11:28.355 --> 11:29.755
( nervous chuckle )

11:29.789 --> 11:32.725
THAT DOESN'T HAVE
TO BE WHAT HAPPENED.

11:32.759 --> 11:34.161
YOU TWO WANT
SOME BREAKFAST?

11:34.193 --> 11:35.828
MY MORNING PATIENT
RESCHEDULED.

11:35.861 --> 11:38.097
UM, I HAVE
TO GET TO WORK.

11:38.130 --> 11:40.700
- SO...
- LEO, YOU WANT SOME
COFFEE AT LEAST?

11:40.734 --> 11:42.869
( exhales )
I GOT NOWHERE TO BE.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.004
SO SURE, YEAH.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.706
JUST LET ME GET THIS STUFF
IN THE DISHWASHER.

11:48.207 --> 11:49.842
SOMEONE TOLD ME SHE WAS
GONNA TAKE CARE OF IT--

11:49.875 --> 11:51.211
YEAH, SORRY.
I FORGOT.

11:51.244 --> 11:52.846
WE WERE JUST, UM--

11:52.879 --> 11:54.213
LISTENING TO MUSIC,
I KNOW.

11:54.246 --> 11:56.415
( dishes clinking )

12:00.419 --> 12:03.255
( door opens, closes )

12:03.289 --> 12:05.392
Leo:
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN
THAT JOB, ANYWAY.

12:05.424 --> 12:08.294
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT LIKE
I HAVE SOME GREAT TALENT
FOR BAKING.

12:08.327 --> 12:09.328
( sighs )

12:09.361 --> 12:11.163
OR ANYTHING ELSE
THAT I KNOW OF.

12:11.197 --> 12:13.033
SO YOU'RE STILL
FEELING IMPOTENT?

12:14.934 --> 12:16.836
I MEAN...

12:16.870 --> 12:19.405
IN A HELPLESS
SENSE OF THE WORD.

12:19.438 --> 12:21.875
RIGHT, YEAH.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.211
WELL, IT SOUNDS TO ME
LIKE YOU'RE ALLOWING THIS

12:24.244 --> 12:27.947
WHOLE JOB THING TO
DEFINE YOUR SELF-WORTH.

12:27.980 --> 12:31.485
YOU SURVIVED
A LIFE-THREATENING ILLNESS.

12:31.518 --> 12:33.519
AND APRIL TOLD ME
ABOUT WHAT YOU DID

12:33.753 --> 12:36.222
HELPING THOSE KIDS
LIVE OUT THEIR LAST WISHES.

12:36.255 --> 12:39.893
I MEAN, DO YOU REALIZE
HOW REMARKABLE THAT IS?

12:39.926 --> 12:42.528
YEAH, BUT I COULDN'T
HAVE DONE ANY OF THAT
WITHOUT MY DAD'S MONEY.

12:42.761 --> 12:45.298
THAT'S THE THING.
EVERYONE SEES ME

12:45.331 --> 12:46.866
AS BRUCE HENDRIE'S SON

12:46.899 --> 12:49.970
OR BRUCE HENDRIE'S SON
WITH A BRAIN TUMOR.

12:50.003 --> 12:53.340
WELL THEN,
THAT'S YOUR CHALLENGE,

12:53.373 --> 12:55.908
SHOWING PEOPLE
WHO YOU ARE.

12:58.544 --> 13:02.414
WHEN WE EXERCISE,
OUR BODIES RELEASE...

13:02.448 --> 13:03.984
ENDORPHINS

13:04.017 --> 13:06.119
THAT CAN HAVE
A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT

13:06.153 --> 13:08.922
- ON OUR EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING.
- ( students mutter, laugh )

13:08.955 --> 13:10.123
TAKE MY WIFE CAROL--

13:10.157 --> 13:12.458
GREER, IS THERE A REASON

13:12.491 --> 13:13.460
YOU MISSED HALF THE CLASS?

13:13.493 --> 13:15.227
YEAH.

13:15.261 --> 13:17.129
YOU WANT TO SHARE
THAT REASON WITH ME?

13:18.230 --> 13:19.499
NOT REALLY.

13:19.533 --> 13:21.134
Teacher:
THEN I'LL SEE YOU
AFTER SCHOOL

13:21.168 --> 13:23.937
- FOR DETENTION.
- ( chair scrapes loudly )

13:23.970 --> 13:25.404
WHERE'RE YOU GOING?

13:25.437 --> 13:27.573
GETTING SOME EXERCISE.

13:29.042 --> 13:31.411
( whispers, laughs )

13:43.990 --> 13:45.524
NO TACOS TODAY?

13:45.558 --> 13:47.259
AARON BANNED ME
FROM THE INTERNS.

13:47.293 --> 13:49.095
- BUMMER.
- YEAH.

13:49.129 --> 13:50.563
SO, HEY, I KNOW
YOU'RE TOTALLY FINE

13:50.596 --> 13:52.131
GETTING THIS RICHIE PIECE
ON YOUR OWN...

13:52.164 --> 13:54.100
- YUP.
- ...BUT MY OFFER
STILL STANDS

13:54.134 --> 13:55.869
IF YOU WANT
TO JOIN FORCES.

13:55.902 --> 13:59.605
OR MAYBE WE COULD EVEN
MAKE A LITTLE CHALLENGE
OUT OF IT.

13:59.838 --> 14:01.975
WHOEVER GETS THE SCOOP

14:02.008 --> 14:04.476
ON WHETHER HE'S GETTING
TRADED TO ANOTHER TEAM, WINS.

14:04.510 --> 14:07.547
- WINS WHAT?
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.

14:07.581 --> 14:09.615
VIETNAMESE TACOS

14:09.849 --> 14:12.018
HAND-DELIVERED BY THE LOSER
EVERY DAY FOR A WEEK.

14:12.052 --> 14:14.187
MMM.

14:14.221 --> 14:15.422
SEE YOU AND RICHIE
AT THE CLUB?

14:15.455 --> 14:17.389
IF YOU CAN
GET YOURSELF IN.

14:17.423 --> 14:18.390
IT'S MEMBERS ONLY.

14:18.424 --> 14:19.993
DON'T UNDERESTIMATE ME.

14:20.025 --> 14:21.161
I ALREADY AM.

14:22.629 --> 14:24.630
GAME ON.

14:29.201 --> 14:30.570
Woman:
I'M A LONG-TIME CUSTOMER
OF THAT DRY CLEANER

14:30.604 --> 14:32.004
AND THAT WAS
A GUCCI BLOUSE.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.173
I WOULD KNOW IF
THERE WAS A STAIN ON IT

14:33.206 --> 14:34.407
BEFORE I BROUGHT IT IN.

14:34.441 --> 14:37.344
WELL, SOMETIMES WE FOCUS
ON MATERIAL THINGS

14:37.376 --> 14:41.081
WHEN WE'RE ACTUALLY
RESPONDING TO A BIGGER

14:41.114 --> 14:42.982
PROBLEMATIC SITUATION
IN OUR LIVES.

14:43.015 --> 14:44.985
LET'S TRY TO GO
A LITTLE DEEPER.

14:45.018 --> 14:46.485
( knocking )

14:46.519 --> 14:48.254
UH, SORRY.

14:48.288 --> 14:49.623
OH, JUST ONE MINUTE.

14:52.359 --> 14:54.059
I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF A SESSION.

14:54.094 --> 14:56.363
I GET ONE PARKING SPACE
FOR MY CLIENTS--

14:56.395 --> 14:58.498
THAT WAS ON THE LEASE
I SIGNED WHEN I MOVED IN

14:58.530 --> 15:00.166
TO THIS OFFICE BUILDING
TWO WEEKS AGO--

15:00.200 --> 15:02.668
AND RIGHT NOW,
THERE IS A RANGE ROVER
PARKED IN MY SPOT.

15:06.005 --> 15:07.974
Sara:
BLAIR, DID YOU PARK
IN A SPOT MARKED

15:08.008 --> 15:09.174
"IMMIGRATION LAW CLIENT"?

15:10.442 --> 15:12.312
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.317
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

15:17.350 --> 15:18.585
PLEASE DON'T
INTERRUPT MY SESSIONS.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.186
THEN DON'T GIVE ME
A REASON TO.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.288
OKAY? IF WE'RE GONNA
SHARE THIS OFFICE,

15:22.322 --> 15:23.690
I NEED SOME RESPECT, TOO.

15:23.923 --> 15:28.360
OKAY, IF WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT RESPECT,

15:28.394 --> 15:30.129
WOULD YOU PLEASE
ASK YOUR CLIENTS

15:30.163 --> 15:31.498
NOT TO STAND
OUTSIDE MY DOOR
AND TALK.

15:31.530 --> 15:33.365
IT'S VERY DISTRACTING.

15:33.399 --> 15:36.970
WELL, THEY STAND THERE
BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY TWO CHAIRS
IN OUR WAITING ROOM.

15:37.003 --> 15:38.571
AND THERE ARE
MORE THAN TWO PEOPLE

15:38.605 --> 15:40.307
TRYING TO GAIN CITIZENSHIP
TO THIS COUNTRY,

15:40.340 --> 15:42.207
BUT, YEAH, SURE,
I'LL TELL THEM TO
KEEP IT DOWN.

15:42.241 --> 15:44.943
I MEAN, YOU NEED
TO FOCUS WHILE YOU'RE
ADVISING YOUR CLIENTS

15:44.977 --> 15:46.712
ON WHETHER TO SERVE
RED OR GREEN GRAPES

15:46.946 --> 15:48.081
AT THEIR NEXT YACHT PARTY.

15:56.690 --> 15:58.557
SORRY.

16:01.660 --> 16:03.062
( sighs )

16:03.096 --> 16:04.397
WHERE WERE WE?

16:05.532 --> 16:06.633
MY SHIRT.

16:09.702 --> 16:11.504
RIGHT.

16:11.538 --> 16:13.038
( cellphone rings, beeps )

16:13.072 --> 16:14.274
HELLO?

16:14.307 --> 16:15.607
Julian:
Amy Snow said yes
to Homecoming.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.376
I'M SORRY?

16:17.409 --> 16:18.711
AMY SNOW.

16:18.745 --> 16:20.447
SHE SAID YES TO ME.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.414
THIS IS JULIAN,
BY THE WAY.

16:22.448 --> 16:25.451
I'M ASSUMING AMY SNOW
IS A GIRL AT YOUR SCHOOL.

16:25.485 --> 16:26.720
Yeah, a junior girl.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.721
IT'S BASICALLY
UNHEARD OF FOR A JUNIOR GIRL

16:28.754 --> 16:30.023
TO GO OUT
WITH A FRESHMAN.

16:30.056 --> 16:31.224
I MEAN, LET ALONE AMY SNOW.

16:31.256 --> 16:32.491
SHE'S LIKE
THE HOTTEST GIRL
I ASKED OUT.

16:32.524 --> 16:34.193
UH, HELLO.

16:34.226 --> 16:35.595
DO YOU THINK
SHE JUST SAID YES

16:35.628 --> 16:36.696
BECAUSE I MENTIONED MY PRESS?

16:36.730 --> 16:39.331
BY "PRESS,"
DO YOU MEAN ME?

16:39.365 --> 16:41.500
UH, YEAH. UH...

16:41.533 --> 16:42.568
DO YOU THINK
THERE'S ANY CHANCE

16:42.601 --> 16:43.736
YOU CAN INTERVIEW ME TONIGHT

16:43.769 --> 16:45.038
WHILE I'M WITH AMY SNOW?

16:46.438 --> 16:48.640
- YOU WANT ME
TO COME TO THE DANCE?
- Please, woman.

16:48.674 --> 16:51.076
I MEAN, I HAVE TO
IMPRESS AMY SNOW.

16:51.110 --> 16:53.546
UH...

16:53.580 --> 16:55.115
FINE, I'LL SWING BY.

16:55.148 --> 16:56.482
And, hey, Julian,

16:56.515 --> 16:58.084
FIRST RULE OF
IMPRESSING AMY SNOW,

16:58.118 --> 17:00.120
STOP CALLING HER
AMY SNOW.

17:00.153 --> 17:02.087
UH, UH, OKAY.

17:06.092 --> 17:07.660
( sighs )

17:07.693 --> 17:10.462
- ( tattoo gun buzzing )
- I CANNOT BELIEVE

17:10.497 --> 17:13.532
THAT YOU JUST
GAVE A GROWN MAN
A UNICORN TATTOO.

17:13.566 --> 17:16.169
I HAVE HIS
CONTACT INFORMATION
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED.

17:16.201 --> 17:17.503
- ( laughs )
- ( rock music playing )

17:17.537 --> 17:20.507
THIS PLACE IS
NOT WHAT I PICTURED.

17:20.539 --> 17:22.174
HEY.

17:22.208 --> 17:24.144
DON'T YOU HAVE DETENTION?

17:24.176 --> 17:26.679
WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO,
GIVE ME MORE DETENTION?

17:26.712 --> 17:30.048
OKAY, NOW YOU'RE JUST
BECOMING MY IDOL.

17:30.083 --> 17:31.217
I'M GOING
OUT OF TOWN,
ANYWAY.

17:31.250 --> 17:33.420
MY PARENTS DECIDED
TO STAY IN NEW YORK

17:33.452 --> 17:34.721
FOR A COUPLE MORE DAYS,

17:34.753 --> 17:36.088
SO I THINK I'M GONNA
GO HANG OUT AT OUR HOUSE

17:36.122 --> 17:37.690
ON NANTUCKET FOR THE NIGHT.

17:37.723 --> 17:38.758
YOU GUYS WANT TO COME?

17:38.791 --> 17:40.692
UM...

17:41.795 --> 17:43.462
AREN'T WE BANNED
FROM SEEING EACH OTHER?

17:43.496 --> 17:46.266
SO TELL YOUR MOM
YOU'RE STAYING AT FORD'S HOUSE.

17:46.298 --> 17:48.067
COME ON,
NANTUCKET'S AWESOME.

17:48.101 --> 17:49.769
WE CAN GO BIKE RIDING,

17:51.703 --> 17:53.740
WH-- WHARVES?

17:53.772 --> 17:55.340

18:00.779 --> 18:02.714
WELL, WE'RE PRETTY DEAD.

CAN'T WE JUST
CLOSE UP FOR THE DAY?

18:05.518 --> 18:08.587
YEAH, I JUST HAVE
TO DO SOME INVENTORY.

18:08.621 --> 18:11.223
THERE'S A FERRY AT 7:00.
I CAN WAIT.

18:11.257 --> 18:12.759
I CAN'T.
I'M GONNA START

18:12.791 --> 18:15.595
LOOKING AT PICTURES
OF LOBSTERS ONLINE.

GOT TO PUT YOUR
FOOTPRINT DOWN

18:34.146 --> 18:35.615
ON YOUR LITTLE
CORNER OF THE GLOBE.

18:35.647 --> 18:37.650
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
IF "GLOBAL FOOTPRINT"

18:37.683 --> 18:41.488
IS CONSIDERED
A FLATTERING PHRASE
THESE DAYS, BUT...

18:41.520 --> 18:44.423
UM, LISTEN, I, UH...

18:44.457 --> 18:45.458
I GOT A LOT
OF BILLS TO PAY

18:45.491 --> 18:47.693
AND I NOTICED THAT, UM,

18:47.727 --> 18:49.496
YOU HAVEN'T TRANSFERRED
THE MONEY FOR THIS MONTH

18:49.528 --> 18:51.230

18:51.263 --> 18:52.865

18:52.898 --> 18:54.233

STAY HERE.

18:55.868 --> 18:58.136

19:00.440 --> 19:01.673
HEY, LEO.

HEY, ELI, YEAH.

19:07.547 --> 19:10.482

INTERNING FOR MY DAD?

19:10.517 --> 19:12.919
ELI IS ACTUALLY

19:13.152 --> 19:14.753
MY HEAD ARCHITECT

19:14.787 --> 19:17.690
SNATCHED HIM RIGHT OUT
OF PRINCETON ARCHITECTURE.

19:17.723 --> 19:19.157
AND WHEN HE'S DONE HERE,

19:19.192 --> 19:21.894
HE'S GOING TO SOUTH KOREA
TO HELP DESIGN THE DOME

19:21.928 --> 19:23.930
FOR THE 2018 WINTER OLYMPICS.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.597
YEAH, I FIGURE
IT'S THE CLOSEST

19:25.632 --> 19:27.267
I'M EVER GONNA GET
TO BEING AN ATHLETE.

19:27.299 --> 19:30.236
- ( Bruce laughs, snorts )
- ( forced laughs )

19:30.269 --> 19:31.570
WELL, ANYWAY,
THE MONEY WILL BE

19:31.604 --> 19:32.939
IN YOUR ACCOUNT
BY TOMORROW.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.275
OH, OKAY,
YEAH, THANKS.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.513
YEAH, IT'S A TOUGH ONE.

19:41.548 --> 19:42.848
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T REALLY
WEAR THE SAME DRESS

19:42.882 --> 19:44.517
TO A HIGH SCHOOL DANCE
AND THEN A HOT CLUB.

19:44.550 --> 19:47.185
HMM, I KNOW.
IF I DRESS TOO SEXY
FOR THE DANCE,

19:47.220 --> 19:48.354
I'LL JUST LOOK
LIKE THE CHAPERONE

19:48.387 --> 19:49.454
WHO'S TRYING TO
RELIVE HER YOUTH.

19:49.489 --> 19:50.522
YEAH, BUT AT THE CLUB,

19:50.557 --> 19:51.691
YOU KIND OF HAVE
TO SLUT IT UP TO FIT IN.

19:51.723 --> 19:53.625
NOT REALLY, I MEAN,
I'M STILL A REPORTER.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.761
A REPORTER WHO'S READY
TO TALK SOME BASEBALL

19:55.795 --> 19:56.828

HAD A MEMBERSHIP.

20:03.368 --> 20:04.403
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I'M SURE YOU'LL

20:04.436 --> 20:06.372
MAKE IT UP TO HIM
AFTER THE PROM,

20:06.405 --> 20:07.906
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

20:07.941 --> 20:09.808
IT'S HOMECOMING.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.644

I MET A MAN HERE.

22:59.010 --> 23:00.747
HE'S TAKEN ME OUT
A FEW TIMES

23:00.779 --> 23:02.548

24:53.192 --> 24:55.560

AND YOU KNOW HOW THEY ARE.

24:55.595 --> 24:57.230

27:43.996 --> 27:45.765
SO THAT MY CLIENT
CAN ACTUALLY ENJOY
HIMSELF TONIGHT.

27:45.798 --> 27:47.932
ACTUALLY, I'M--
I'M NEITHER.

27:47.967 --> 27:49.769
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT
GONNA GET RICHIE FOR ME,

27:49.801 --> 27:51.037
DO YOU MIND
GIVING HIM A MESSAGE?

27:51.069 --> 27:52.971
- HM-HMM.
- CAN YOU TELL HIM

27:53.005 --> 27:54.940
THE GIRL THAT
HE MET LAST MONTH
IN NEW YORK

27:54.973 --> 27:56.041
AFTER PLAYING THE METS

27:56.075 --> 27:57.777
JUST HAD A VISIT
TO THE GYNECOLOGIST.

27:57.809 --> 28:00.980
AND TURNS OUT HE SHARED
A LITTLE MORE WITH ME

28:01.012 --> 28:02.181
THAT NIGHT THAN
A BOTTLE OF DOM

28:02.213 --> 28:03.249
AND A VIEW
OF THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE.

28:04.916 --> 28:06.951
- ( clicks tongue )
- WAIT HERE.

28:09.387 --> 28:11.057
( harsh exhale )

28:18.029 --> 28:19.731
YOU, SERIOUSLY?

28:19.765 --> 28:22.801
WOW, YOU REALLY DID
HAVE SOME FUN IN NEW YORK
AFTER THE METS GAME.

28:22.835 --> 28:23.868
THAT WAS JUST
A LUCKY GUESS.

28:23.903 --> 28:25.805
NICE HAIRCUT, BY THE WAY.

28:25.837 --> 28:27.006
WHAT IS THAT?
YOUR LAME ATTEMPT

28:27.038 --> 28:28.707
TO GO UNDERCOVER
AND STALK ME MORE?

28:36.048 --> 28:38.217
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

28:38.250 --> 28:40.118
IT'S OKAY.
NO ONE DOES.

28:40.152 --> 28:42.454
I'M SO SORRY.

28:42.488 --> 28:46.192
DON'T BE,
'CAUSE IN A WEIRD WAY,

28:46.224 --> 28:48.059
I KIND OF
OWE MY LIFE TO YOU.

28:48.094 --> 28:50.229
IF I HADN'T TRACKED YOU DOWN
AT THAT BLOOD DRIVE,

28:50.261 --> 28:51.797
I NEVER WOULD HAVE FAINTED.

28:51.830 --> 28:53.432
AND THEN I WOULDN'T HAVE
BEEN DIAGNOSED SO EARLY...

28:53.465 --> 28:56.167
AND WHO KNOWS WHAT
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.

28:59.371 --> 28:59.838
( sighs )

28:59.872 --> 29:01.307
I BET WE ARE
THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE
AT THIS CLUB

29:01.339 --> 29:03.741
REFLECTING ON
LIFE AND DEATH
RIGHT NOW.

29:03.776 --> 29:05.310
I DON'T KNOW.

29:05.344 --> 29:07.512
I'M SURE THAT GIRL
PASSED OUT IN THAT
CORNER OVER THERE

29:07.746 --> 29:09.115
IS HAVING SOME
PRETTY DEEP DREAMS.

29:09.147 --> 29:10.516
( both chuckle )

29:10.749 --> 29:14.519
UM, SO I HAVE
HEARD A FEW RUMORS

29:14.752 --> 29:17.123
ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN
WHEN YOUR CONTRACT IS UP

29:17.155 --> 29:19.491
- FOR RENEGOTIATION.
- BABE, LET'S DANCE.

29:19.525 --> 29:21.861
COME ON.

29:23.295 --> 29:25.131
I...

29:26.132 --> 29:27.365
- MMM.
- ( phone dings )

29:44.383 --> 29:47.552
LIKE, IF PEOPLE AT SCHOOL
KNEW ABOUT THIS...

29:48.554 --> 29:49.954
I DON'T KNOW.

29:49.989 --> 29:52.391
Kieran:
I'M NOT GONNA
SAY ANYTHING,

29:52.423 --> 29:55.260
NOT THAT I KNOW ANYONE
AT YOUR SCHOOL, ANYWAY.

29:55.294 --> 29:56.961
ME NEITHER.

29:56.996 --> 29:58.830
CONE OF SILENCE.

29:58.864 --> 30:00.132
( girls chuckling )

30:02.500 --> 30:04.903
I JUST FEEL
LIKE A FREAK.

30:04.936 --> 30:08.007
LIKE I HAVE THIS WEIRD,
DARK SECRET.

30:08.039 --> 30:09.807
YOU'RE NOT A FREAK.

30:09.842 --> 30:11.876
WE ALL FEEL LIKE THAT
SOMETIMES.

30:11.911 --> 30:14.046
AND EVERYONE
HAS SECRETS.

30:14.078 --> 30:15.513
YEAH, BUT NOT LIKE THIS.

30:15.548 --> 30:17.348
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

30:17.383 --> 30:19.518
COME ON, BRENNA,
I KNOW YOU.

30:19.551 --> 30:21.586
YOU DON'T KNOW
EVERYTHING.

30:29.361 --> 30:31.130
( sighs )

30:31.163 --> 30:33.164
SO...

30:35.267 --> 30:37.036
RIGHT WHEN I STARTED
TO GO TO CHARTON,

30:37.068 --> 30:39.104
THERE WAS THIS SENIOR
WHO HAD A CRUSH ON ME.

30:40.105 --> 30:42.173
DO YOU REMEMBER
A JAKE COHEN?

30:42.208 --> 30:45.243
- YEAH, HE WAS, LIKE...
- REALLY POPULAR.

30:45.277 --> 30:47.246
YEAH.

30:47.278 --> 30:50.048
WELL, I WAS STILL REALLY
DEPRESSED ABOUT MY DAD

30:50.082 --> 30:52.284
AND HE HAD LOST HIS DAD.

30:52.317 --> 30:54.019
WE BECAME REALLY CLOSE.

30:54.052 --> 30:56.154
HE WAS THE FIRST GUY
THAT I EVER SLEPT WITH.

30:57.288 --> 31:00.558
THE ONLY GUY, ACTUALLY.

31:00.593 --> 31:04.462
ANYWAY, UM...

31:04.496 --> 31:07.232
ONE DAY I REALIZED
THAT MY PERIOD WAS, LIKE,

31:07.266 --> 31:08.299
TWO WEEKS LATE.

31:09.969 --> 31:14.073
YEAH, I TOLD JAKE,
AND HE FREAKED OUT.

31:15.441 --> 31:17.409
I MEAN, HE WAS
JUST ABOUT TO GRADUATE,

31:17.442 --> 31:21.446
SO HE COULDN'T
DEAL WITH THAT.

31:23.348 --> 31:25.884
SO HE WROTE ME A CHECK
SO I COULD TAKE CARE OF IT

31:25.917 --> 31:28.153
AS LONG AS
I DIDN'T TELL ANYONE.

31:28.186 --> 31:30.221
OH MY GOD.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.358
I ONLY TOLD
ONE OTHER PERSON--

31:34.559 --> 31:36.161
MY LAB PARTNER.

31:38.329 --> 31:39.932
SHE WENT WITH ME
TO CONNECTICUT

31:39.964 --> 31:41.400
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
HAVE IT DONE HERE

31:41.432 --> 31:43.469
WITHOUT A PARENT'S CONSENT.

31:43.501 --> 31:45.304
AND WE'VE BEEN
REALLY CLOSE EVER SINCE.

31:47.405 --> 31:48.406
FORD?

31:49.907 --> 31:52.144
SHE'S THE ONLY
OTHER PERSON WHO KNOWS.

31:52.176 --> 31:54.046
( sighs )

31:54.078 --> 31:56.281
I COULDN'T EVEN
TELL MY FAMILY.

31:56.315 --> 32:00.184
THEY WERE STILL
SO MESSED UP ABOUT MY DAD.

32:03.989 --> 32:06.157
SO...

32:06.191 --> 32:09.662
WELL, YOU KNOW YOUR
SECRET'S SAFE WITH ME.

32:09.694 --> 32:11.396
WOW.

32:13.598 --> 32:16.335
YEAH, THANKS
FOR TRUSTING US.

32:16.367 --> 32:18.971
WELL, I DON'T TRUST YOU.

32:21.205 --> 32:22.240
NOT UNTIL
YOU CONFESS SOMETHING.

32:22.273 --> 32:24.676
YEAH, KIERAN, SPILL.

32:24.710 --> 32:26.979
( chuckles )

32:27.011 --> 32:30.316
DUDE, WE JUST
BARED OUR SOULS.

32:30.348 --> 32:32.417
GIVE US YOUR DEEPEST,
DARKEST SECRET.

32:34.420 --> 32:36.387
- NOW.
- FINE.

32:38.022 --> 32:40.159
( chuckles )

32:40.192 --> 32:42.060
SO YOU KNOW HOW I...

32:43.228 --> 32:45.564
ALWAYS MAKE FUN
OF TRAMP STAMPS?

32:47.965 --> 32:49.300
( both laughing )

32:56.174 --> 32:58.176
HOW DID I NEVER SEE THAT?

32:58.210 --> 32:59.577
BECAUSE I WAS VERY GOOD
AT HIDING IT FROM YOU.

32:59.611 --> 33:03.182
- ( laughs )
- WHO IS ROSIE?

33:03.214 --> 33:04.450
IS THAT YOUR EX?

33:04.482 --> 33:06.417
( sighs )

33:06.451 --> 33:08.653
NO, SHE'S MY...

33:08.686 --> 33:10.422
ENGLISH TEACHER
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

33:10.455 --> 33:11.990
- ( laughs )
- NOT JUST ANY TEACHER.

33:12.023 --> 33:14.026
THE SMARTEST, HOTTEST
TEACHER EVER.

33:14.058 --> 33:16.028
SOME PEOPLE WRITE
LOVE NOTES OR POEMS.

33:16.060 --> 33:17.695
I THOUGHT I'D PUT MY INK
SOMEWHERE MORE MEMORABLE.

33:17.730 --> 33:20.231
( all laugh )

33:20.265 --> 33:23.434
THAT IS SUCH
A CUTE DARK SECRET.

33:23.469 --> 33:26.305
DO YOU THINK WE CAN
FIND ROSIE ONLINE?

33:26.337 --> 33:28.039
( laughing )
I HATE THIS GAME!

33:28.073 --> 33:30.142
I OFFICIALLY
HATE THIS GAME.

33:30.174 --> 33:31.210
( laughing )

33:31.242 --> 33:33.479
Carey:
NO NO NO!

33:33.511 --> 33:35.047
SOMEONE SHOULD
KICK HIM OUT

33:35.079 --> 33:37.482
- FOR HOMOPHOBIA!
- CAREY, WHAT IS GOING ON?

33:37.516 --> 33:39.550
NOTHING, I JUST TRIED
TO HAVE A LITTLE CHAT

33:39.585 --> 33:41.286
WITH MIRANDA'S AGENT
IN THE BATHROOM

33:41.319 --> 33:42.320
ABOUT SPORTS!

33:42.354 --> 33:44.288
AND THEY'RE KICKING ME OUT.

33:44.323 --> 33:45.557
IF YOU WIN BY DEFAULT,
I'M NOT COUNTING IT.

33:45.590 --> 33:46.724
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
I'M GOING TO.

33:46.759 --> 33:48.126
I HAD RICHIE,
AND THEN I LOST HIM.

33:48.160 --> 33:50.695
ALL RIGHT, SO WE'LL CALL IT
A DRAW THEN, CARVER.

33:50.729 --> 33:52.463
FOR NOW.

33:52.498 --> 33:53.798
THERE WILL BE A RE-MATCH.

33:54.031 --> 33:55.299
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

34:03.241 --> 34:05.611
( ringing )

34:05.644 --> 34:07.445
It's Leo,
leave a message.

34:07.479 --> 34:09.648
HEY, LEO,
WHERE ARE YOU?

34:09.681 --> 34:11.750
UM, I'M DONE WITH
THE RICHIE THING FOR TONIGHT.

34:11.784 --> 34:13.318
AND I REALLY--
WE SHOULD GET GOING

34:13.351 --> 34:14.786
IF WE WANT
TO MAKE JULIAN'S DANCE.

34:14.820 --> 34:16.320
GIVE ME A CALL.

34:16.355 --> 34:18.056
( exhales )

34:18.090 --> 34:19.757
( men cheering,
laughing )

34:32.371 --> 34:34.639
( sniffing )

34:34.672 --> 34:36.074
( deep exhale )

34:39.210 --> 34:40.512
HEY, DO YOU HAVE ANYMORE
OF THAT STUFF?

34:41.813 --> 34:43.347
Leo: THANKS.

34:58.230 --> 34:59.664
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

34:59.697 --> 35:01.432
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
HOW ABOUT WE DON'T SAY ANYTHING?

35:01.467 --> 35:03.268
JUST LET IT GO,
ROLL WITH IT?

35:03.302 --> 35:04.503
OF COURSE YOU'RE
NOT GONNA ROLL WITH IT.

35:04.536 --> 35:06.170
- IT'S YOU.
- DON'T TURN THIS AROUND.

35:06.204 --> 35:07.739
DON'T ACT LIKE I'M UPTIGHT
IF I'M NOT COOL

35:07.773 --> 35:10.375
WITH MY BOYFRIEND,
WHO JUST SURVIVED BRAIN CANCER,

35:10.409 --> 35:12.411
SNORTING DRUGS
INTO HIS BRAIN

35:12.443 --> 35:14.579
- WITH SOMEONE THAT I--
- I DIDN'T KNOW RICHIE
WAS GONNA BE THERE.

35:14.612 --> 35:16.681
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M TRYING
TO SCREW UP YOUR STORY

35:16.715 --> 35:18.317
- OR ANYTHING.
- FORGET THAT STORY.

35:18.349 --> 35:19.851
I JUST WALKED INTO
A WAY BIGGER ONE.

35:19.885 --> 35:22.554
AND YOU KNOW WHO ELSE
I CAN PUT IN THAT STORY?

35:22.588 --> 35:24.188
THE SON OF
A VERY PUBLIC FIGURE.

35:24.222 --> 35:26.625
OH, THANK YOU.
YEAH, I FORGOT I WAS
BRUCE HENDRIE'S SON.

35:26.657 --> 35:29.327
I'M GLAD TO KNOW
THAT'S HOW MY GIRLFRIEND
DEFINES ME TOO.

35:29.360 --> 35:31.463
WHATEVER, I AM NOT
GONNA FEEL SORRY FOR YOU
RIGHT NOW.

35:31.496 --> 35:32.831
YOU CLEARLY DON'T CARE

35:32.864 --> 35:35.400
HOW YOUR ACTIONS
AFFECT ME AT ALL.

35:35.434 --> 35:36.869
OH, I'M SORRY.
I FORGOT.

35:36.902 --> 35:40.137
EVERYTHING'S ABOUT YOU
AND YOUR CAREER.

35:40.172 --> 35:42.340
YOU KNOW WHAT?
JUST DO IT.

35:42.373 --> 35:44.208
WRITE YOUR STUPID EXPOSE.
PUT ME IN IT.

35:44.242 --> 35:46.677
IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S
GONNA SURPRISE ANYONE.

35:46.711 --> 35:48.413
I SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE
SCREWING UP

35:48.447 --> 35:51.550
BEFORE I GOT SICK.
I FAILED OUT OF EXETER.

35:51.583 --> 35:53.751
I GOT ARRESTED
FOR SMUGGLING POT!

35:53.784 --> 35:56.454
OF COURSE I WAS GONNA
GRADUATE TO THE HARDER STUFF.

35:56.487 --> 35:58.257
THAT WAS ALWAYS
GONNA BE MY STORY.

35:58.289 --> 36:01.326
EVERYONE THINKS THAT
I'M THIS IDIOT RICH KID.

36:01.360 --> 36:04.195
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
MAYBE THEY'RE RIGHT.

36:04.228 --> 36:06.331
MAYBE THAT'S JUST WHO I AM.

36:06.364 --> 36:08.166
I DON'T GET IT.

36:08.199 --> 36:11.269
WHY AREN'T YOU APPRECIATING
THE FACT THAT YOU ARE ALIVE

36:11.302 --> 36:13.438
INSTEAD OF DWELLING ON
WHAT'VE GOT TO DO

36:13.472 --> 36:15.507
- WITH THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?
- OF COURSE YOU DON'T GET IT.

36:15.541 --> 36:16.942
YOU'VE ALWAYS KNOWN,

36:17.175 --> 36:19.344
WHICH IS GREAT FOR YOU.
YOU'RE BLESSED.

36:19.378 --> 36:20.612
- BUT THAT'S NOT--
- I'M BLESSED?!

36:20.646 --> 36:22.547
- I HAD CANCER!
- SO WHAT?! SO DID I!

36:22.581 --> 36:23.715
WELL, I'M STARTING
TO THINK THAT

36:23.748 --> 36:25.650
THAT'S MAYBE THE ONLY THING
WE HAVE IN COMMON!

36:25.684 --> 36:27.753
WHICH MAKES ME WONDER
IF WE WEREN'T BOTH SICK,

36:27.786 --> 36:29.554
WOULD WE STILL EVEN
WANT TO BE TOGETHER?!

36:34.192 --> 36:36.527
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.
MAYBE THAT'S ALL THIS IS.

36:38.864 --> 36:41.365
FINE,
KEEP SABOTAGING YOURSELF

36:41.400 --> 36:42.601
AND PUSHING PEOPLE AWAY

36:42.634 --> 36:45.570
BECAUSE YOU'RE ROMANTICIZING
SOME DOWNWARD SPIRAL.

36:45.603 --> 36:47.972
WOW, IMPRESSIVE ANALYSIS.

36:48.206 --> 36:50.342
WHAT, IS YOUR MOM A SHRINK
OR SOMETHING?

36:50.375 --> 36:51.909
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU.

36:53.778 --> 36:56.380
AND I JUST MISSED THAT KID'S
DANCE BECAUSE OF YOU.

36:56.414 --> 36:58.983
SO CONGRATULATIONS, LEO,
YOU ACCOMPLISHED SOMETHING!

38:24.503 --> 38:26.038
( chuckles )
THERE'S BOSTON FOR YOU.

38:31.976 --> 38:33.644
SO HOW'S IT GOING?

38:33.679 --> 38:35.713
IT'S OKAY.

38:41.052 --> 38:43.054
SO I WENT TO THIS CLUB
LAST NIGHT

38:43.088 --> 38:45.456
TO INTERVIEW RICHIE MIRANDA
ABOUT HIS CONTRACT.

38:45.489 --> 38:47.826
I FOUND OUT
HE'S DOING DRUGS AGAIN.

38:47.858 --> 38:49.728
SERIOUSLY?

38:49.760 --> 38:52.998
IF I BREAK A STORY ABOUT
HIM BEING BACK ON DRUGS--

38:53.030 --> 38:54.498
THAT'D BE HUGE,

38:54.532 --> 38:56.034
FOR YOU AND THE PAPER.

38:57.835 --> 39:01.338
OKAY, THIS MIGHT
SOUND STUPID,

39:01.373 --> 39:04.342
BUT I FEEL LIKE
I KIND OF BONDED WITH HIM

39:04.376 --> 39:05.876
WHEN I DID
THAT LAST PIECE ON HIM.

39:06.945 --> 39:09.414
THIS COULD REALLY
SCREW UP HIS LIFE.

39:12.650 --> 39:15.420
I MEAN, THIS IS THE JOB
YOU SIGNED UP FOR.

39:15.454 --> 39:18.489
YOU KNOW, THESE HARD
MORAL CHOICES

39:18.523 --> 39:19.557
COME WITH THE TERRITORY.

39:19.590 --> 39:21.059
YOU JUST NEVER HAD
TO DEAL WITH IT BEFORE

39:21.092 --> 39:22.728
BECAUSE YOU WERE
STILL TOO JUNIOR.

39:22.760 --> 39:24.496
IF ANYTHING,
THIS IS A SIGN

39:24.528 --> 39:26.130
THAT YOU'RE ENTERING
THE BIG LEAGUES.

39:27.766 --> 39:30.936
SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN TO USE
A BASEBALL METAPHOR THERE.

39:30.969 --> 39:32.971
IT'S OKAY.
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

39:33.003 --> 39:34.972
I MEAN, THAT'S LIKE
RULE #1 OF JOURNALISM.

39:35.005 --> 39:37.608
"NEVER LET FEELINGS
CLOUD YOUR JUDGMENT

39:37.641 --> 39:39.878
OR THE PUBLIC'S
RIGHT TO KNOW."

39:39.911 --> 39:42.481
( chuckles )
MAN, ALL I HAVE
TO DO AT WORK

39:42.514 --> 39:44.615
IS LISTEN TO MUSIC
AND DECIDE IF IT'S PRETTY.

39:44.648 --> 39:46.818
I COULD NEVER DO
WHAT YOU DO.

39:48.920 --> 39:51.422
SO HOW'D YOU FIND OUT
RICHIE WAS DOING DRUGS AGAIN?

39:53.157 --> 39:55.760
( sighs )
IT'S A LONG STORY.

39:55.793 --> 39:57.728
YEAH.

39:57.762 --> 40:01.032
GUESS WE'VE ALREADY GONE OVER
OUR 500-WORD LIMIT.

40:13.411 --> 40:14.846
- ( chairs bang )
- AH!

40:14.880 --> 40:16.847
OW! OH.

40:16.882 --> 40:18.617
HI.

40:18.650 --> 40:20.652
I WAS PLANNING
ON HAVING THIS SET UP

40:20.684 --> 40:22.521
- BEFORE YOU GOT HERE.
- HMM.

40:22.554 --> 40:23.922
WELL, YOU SHOULD'VE
SHOWED UP EARLIER THEN,

40:23.954 --> 40:25.523
BECAUSE I WORK
PRETTY LONG HOURS.

40:25.556 --> 40:26.657
LET ME HELP YOU
WITH THAT.

40:27.992 --> 40:29.594
THANK YOU.

40:31.096 --> 40:32.931
THANKS FOR THE CHAIRS.

40:34.833 --> 40:37.568
OH, UH, ADITI IS
NOT MARRYING THAT GUY.

40:37.601 --> 40:38.670
SHE WANTED ME
TO TELL YOU.

40:38.702 --> 40:40.505
OH.

40:41.706 --> 40:43.208
I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT.

40:44.208 --> 40:45.976
YEAH. YEAH.

40:46.010 --> 40:48.746
SHE SAID YOU REALLY
CALMED HER DOWN,

40:48.780 --> 40:50.181
HELPED PUT THINGS
IN PERSPECTIVE.

40:50.215 --> 40:53.217
YOU COULD REALLY HELP
PEOPLE LIKE HER,

40:53.451 --> 40:55.753
IF YOU WANTED.

40:55.786 --> 40:58.190
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE
WHO ACTUALLY NEED HELP.

40:58.222 --> 41:00.659
SO BECAUSE MY CLIENTS
HAVE MONEY

41:00.692 --> 41:01.992
THEY DON'T HAVE
REAL PROBLEMS?

41:02.027 --> 41:04.195
IS THAT-- REALLY?
ARE YOU ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE

41:04.228 --> 41:06.530
WHO BELIEVES
MONEY BUYS HAPPINESS?

41:06.565 --> 41:09.534
HA. "ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE."

41:09.568 --> 41:13.170
I THOUGHT THAT PSYCHOLOGISTS
TRIED NOT TO GENERALIZE.

41:13.204 --> 41:15.639
WE'RE NOT IN SESSION.

41:15.673 --> 41:17.208
( chortles )

41:24.615 --> 41:27.518
Miranda's last drug test
had come in clean,

41:27.552 --> 41:29.621
but given this new allegation
by the "Boston Post,"

41:29.653 --> 41:31.056
he will be tested again.

41:31.088 --> 41:32.791
This development
comes on the heels

41:32.824 --> 41:34.659
of public speculation
about whether Miranda

41:34.693 --> 41:36.260
was about
to extend his contract
with the Sox

41:36.494 --> 41:38.663
or negotiate
with another team.

41:38.697 --> 41:40.599
If this test
comes back positive,

41:40.632 --> 41:43.534
any contract negotiations
in the works will be impacted.

41:43.568 --> 41:45.637
( applause )

41:47.572 --> 41:48.739
NICE WORK.

41:48.773 --> 41:50.108
THANK YOU.

41:52.978 --> 41:56.014
YEAH, SEE THAT?
ALL YOU.

41:57.248 --> 41:58.817
HOW'S IT FEEL
TO MAKE NEWS?

41:58.849 --> 42:02.086
- IT FEELS-- I CAN'T EVEN--
- UH-- UH-- UH--

42:02.119 --> 42:03.088
FRICKIN' GREAT,
THAT'S HOW.

42:03.121 --> 42:04.722
( laughs )

42:06.157 --> 42:08.092
WHAT CAN I SAY, APRIL?

42:08.126 --> 42:09.226
YOU'RE BLESSED.

42:17.635 --> 42:18.670
REALLY?

42:18.702 --> 42:21.239
YOU BREAK A HUGE STORY

42:21.273 --> 42:22.606
AND GET FREE TACO DELIVERY,

42:22.641 --> 42:23.608
AND THAT'S YOUR FACE?

42:23.641 --> 42:25.976
SORRY, I WAS JUST, UM--

42:26.010 --> 42:27.244
THANK YOU.
