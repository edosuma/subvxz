00:21.380 --> 00:22.730
~ Arnold?
~ Hm?

00:22.780 --> 00:24.490
Wake up!

00:24.540 --> 00:25.970
What?

00:39.500 --> 00:41.410
What's going on?

00:41.460 --> 00:43.050
Jacob?

00:43.100 --> 00:45.010
~ Oh, Lord!
~ What on earth is he up to now?

00:45.060 --> 00:46.530
Looks like he's started a fire.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.610
Go downstairs, telephone
the fire brigade,

00:48.660 --> 00:50.090
I'll fetch the extinguisher.

00:50.140 --> 00:53.140
~ Maybe I should help.
~ I'm perfectly capable.

00:55.980 --> 00:57.380
It works!

00:58.980 --> 01:01.050
It actually works!

01:01.100 --> 01:02.640
What works?

01:04.379 --> 01:06.120
My time machine!

01:42.460 --> 01:43.610
Bull's-eye!

01:43.660 --> 01:45.610
Thought you were supposed
to be helping me.

01:45.660 --> 01:47.970
Sorry, Mrs McCarthy, I was
just re-living my youth.

01:48.020 --> 01:51.930
Oh, I suppose you'll
be climbing a tree next.

01:51.980 --> 01:54.850
~ No, no. Not with your gout.
~ Hm.

01:59.100 --> 02:00.130
Sorry to interrupt.

02:00.180 --> 02:02.970
Not to worry. Mrs McCarthy
won't let me play anyway.

02:03.020 --> 02:05.930
Oh, never mind. I wonder
if I might have a word?

02:05.980 --> 02:08.449
Something of a delicate matter.

02:09.660 --> 02:14.130
Manic depressive, obsessive,
and, lately, delusional.

02:14.180 --> 02:17.810
~ Delusional?
~ His father died last year - suicide.

02:17.860 --> 02:20.930
Only Jacob's become
convinced it was murder

02:20.980 --> 02:22.690
by one of his own family.

02:22.740 --> 02:23.770
Could he be right?

02:23.820 --> 02:25.410
Absolutely not!

02:25.460 --> 02:26.930
They're delightful.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.370
How long have you known them?

02:28.420 --> 02:31.530
I met Georgina at a charity function
for the arts several years ago.

02:31.580 --> 02:33.770
She's an aspiring romantic
novelist, like me,

02:33.820 --> 02:36.090
although, frankly, her work
isn't a patch on mine.

02:36.140 --> 02:39.370
Her structure's a bit overwrought
and her language is too flowery.

02:39.420 --> 02:40.410
Back to the murder.

02:40.460 --> 02:41.810
Er, suicide.

02:41.860 --> 02:45.130
Jacob says he can prove
it was foul play.

02:45.180 --> 02:47.610
~ How?
~ Georgina won't tell me,

02:47.660 --> 02:51.770
but she's worried her nephew is
going the same way as his father.

02:51.820 --> 02:54.250
I said you could...

02:54.300 --> 02:57.890
examine the facts of
Frederick's death.

02:57.940 --> 03:00.930
Talk to Jacob. Show
him it was suicide.

03:00.980 --> 03:02.410
Assuming it was.

03:02.460 --> 03:04.810
Frederick was found
in his home laboratory

03:04.860 --> 03:06.490
with a vial of strychnine beside him.

03:06.540 --> 03:10.010
~ Suicide note?
~ No, but the room was locked from the inside.

03:10.060 --> 03:14.170
~ Windows?
~ Yes, but the laboratory's
on the top floor. Sheer drop.

03:14.220 --> 03:17.010
~ Perfect. Let's go.
~ Now?

03:17.060 --> 03:19.460
Yes, no time like the present.

03:20.860 --> 03:22.090
On your marks!

03:22.140 --> 03:24.010
Get set!

03:24.060 --> 03:25.330
Laces.

03:41.060 --> 03:42.530
10.5. Good girl.

03:42.580 --> 03:43.610
Thanks, Dad.

03:43.660 --> 03:45.650
11.5.

03:45.700 --> 03:47.210
Run like that in Vancouver next year

03:47.260 --> 03:49.290
and you'll be coming back
with another bronze.

03:49.340 --> 03:50.970
She deliberately distracted me.

03:51.020 --> 03:52.410
Is that true?

03:52.460 --> 03:53.770
Of course not.

03:53.820 --> 03:55.890
I won't abide cheating.

03:55.940 --> 03:58.340
There's no greater dishonour.

03:58.900 --> 04:02.570
Father Brown, Arnold
Francis - Jacob's uncle.

04:02.620 --> 04:06.210
I've asked the Father to help
with Jacob's... situation.

04:06.260 --> 04:09.130
My cousin doesn't need a priest,
he needs a psychiatrist.

04:09.180 --> 04:11.650
Angelica and Sarah,
Arnold's daughters

04:11.700 --> 04:13.970
and Olympic champions, no less.

04:14.020 --> 04:15.210
Not quite.

04:15.260 --> 04:17.529
Silver and bronze.

04:17.579 --> 04:19.209
I think that still qualifies.

04:19.260 --> 04:21.649
"Champion - a person who's
surpassed all rivals

04:21.700 --> 04:24.770
"in a sporting contest
or other competition."

04:24.820 --> 04:26.250
Oxford English Dictionary.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.650
I stand corrected. Nevertheless...

04:28.700 --> 04:31.410
What do you think you
can do for Jacob?

04:31.460 --> 04:33.370
I don't know till I talk to him.

04:33.420 --> 04:35.850
Well, he's not going
to listen to you.

04:35.900 --> 04:39.610
~ He's an atheist.
~ I'm not trying to convert him.

04:39.660 --> 04:42.770
I'm trying to give him some
answers to some questions.

04:42.820 --> 04:44.100
Girls!

04:47.380 --> 04:49.850
'The story practically
writes itself.'

04:49.900 --> 04:51.570
Sister against sister, head-to-head

04:51.620 --> 04:54.010
at the British Empire
and Commonwealth Games.

04:54.060 --> 04:57.250
You'd be a fool not to cover
it. Everyone else is.

04:59.540 --> 05:02.370
Good, I'll see you tomorrow.

05:02.420 --> 05:04.450
The Times of London are
coming to the luncheon.

05:04.500 --> 05:06.290
Don't say I don't
do anything for you.

05:06.340 --> 05:08.330
How many people are
coming to this thing?

05:08.380 --> 05:10.170
Now is not the time
for penny-pinching.

05:10.220 --> 05:11.690
Felicia, darling!

05:11.740 --> 05:13.140
Georgina!

05:14.260 --> 05:16.730
You're looking as
pulchritudinous as ever.

05:16.780 --> 05:19.330
How very perspicacious of you.

05:19.380 --> 05:23.650
You must be Father Brown. I told
Felicia this wasn't necessary.

05:23.700 --> 05:25.610
~ I'm only here to help.
~ Where's Jacob?

05:25.660 --> 05:26.850
In his laboratory.

05:26.900 --> 05:29.530
In fact, you've come just in time.

05:29.580 --> 05:31.930
He's promised a
demonstration at noon.

05:31.980 --> 05:33.050
Demonstration of what?

05:33.100 --> 05:34.490
His time machine.

05:34.540 --> 05:36.330
~ His what?
~ Told you.

05:36.380 --> 05:38.650
Jacob's studying quantum physics.

05:38.700 --> 05:41.170
22 and already doing
a PhD at Cambridge.

05:41.220 --> 05:42.690
Practically a prodigy.

05:42.740 --> 05:45.010
Even so, he does sound like
he may have been reading

05:45.060 --> 05:46.330
too much HG Wells.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.610
Your predecessors were
similarly damning

05:48.660 --> 05:50.610
of a young scientist named Galileo.

05:50.660 --> 05:52.370
Locked him in a dungeon.

05:52.420 --> 05:56.170
And don't even get me started
on Giordano Bruno.

05:56.220 --> 05:58.410
You must be Jacob. My name's...

05:58.460 --> 06:00.570
~ What's going on?
~ This is Father Brown.

06:00.620 --> 06:03.810
He has some experience
in criminal matters.

06:03.860 --> 06:05.410
Lady Felicia thought he could help.

06:05.460 --> 06:07.930
Father Brown has a commendation
from the constabulary.

06:07.980 --> 06:09.090
I don't need any help.

06:09.140 --> 06:10.610
I'm not here to intrude.

06:10.660 --> 06:13.850
Even so, I must admit to be
fascinated by your field of study.

06:13.900 --> 06:15.690
~ Is that so?
~ Absolutely.

06:15.740 --> 06:17.770
Unlocking the secrets
of the universe -

06:17.820 --> 06:21.810
Einstein, Schrodinger, Heisenberg

06:21.860 --> 06:23.650
and now, perhaps, you.

06:23.700 --> 06:25.730
You've read their work?

06:25.780 --> 06:28.690
Well, can't pretend to
understand everything but,

06:28.740 --> 06:32.410
unlike my predecessors, I believe
that scientific discoveries

06:32.460 --> 06:35.060
should be celebrated, not damned.

06:40.660 --> 06:42.140
It's time.

06:59.140 --> 07:01.370
Lumbricus francisus.

07:01.420 --> 07:03.890
Named after my father.
He discovered them.

07:03.940 --> 07:05.170
Your father was a biologist?

07:05.220 --> 07:07.420
A brilliant one, at that.

07:07.820 --> 07:09.960
This used to be his lab.

07:17.340 --> 07:18.570
And your mother?

07:18.620 --> 07:20.960
She died giving birth to me.

07:21.460 --> 07:22.970
I'm sorry.

07:23.020 --> 07:24.220
Why?

07:27.340 --> 07:29.280
Please, have a seat.

07:34.980 --> 07:39.530
I present to you an invention that
will forever redefine and expand

07:39.580 --> 07:44.130
the known laws of physics,
transforming our world in ways

07:44.180 --> 07:46.610
I can't even begin to imagine...

07:46.660 --> 07:49.250
and ensuring my place in history.

07:49.300 --> 07:53.250
The power to transcend
the fourth dimension,

07:53.300 --> 07:55.700
to captain the arrow of time.

07:58.980 --> 08:01.010
My machine.

08:01.060 --> 08:03.010
Looks like a fairground ride.

08:03.060 --> 08:04.290
How does it work?

08:04.340 --> 08:06.650
By generating radial geodesic motion,

08:06.700 --> 08:10.290
it creates an Einstein-Rosen
bridge, by way of a maximally

08:10.340 --> 08:12.930
extended extrapolation of
the Schwarzschild metric.

08:12.980 --> 08:14.120
Ah.

08:19.460 --> 08:20.650
What are you going to do?

08:20.700 --> 08:23.330
The power cells haven't
fully powered up yet,

08:23.380 --> 08:24.810
so it'll be a short trip.

08:24.860 --> 08:28.620
A quick nip into the future,
then back to the present.

08:30.100 --> 08:31.640
With proof.

08:47.980 --> 08:49.320
Jacob?!

08:51.980 --> 08:53.730
He's going to electrocute
the lot of us.

08:53.780 --> 08:55.970
Jacob!

08:59.620 --> 09:01.220
What the...?

09:02.180 --> 09:04.730
Jacob!

09:19.620 --> 09:21.160
Is that it?

09:33.620 --> 09:36.210
The 12:05 at Newbury should
have just started.

09:36.260 --> 09:37.610
I've got a bet on that.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.050
~ And you are?
~ My chauffeur.

09:39.100 --> 09:40.970
Which horse, Chauffeur?

09:41.020 --> 09:42.450
~ Sailor's Honour.
~ Too bad.

09:42.500 --> 09:43.690
What are you saying?

09:43.740 --> 09:45.770
You've been to the future
and know the result?

09:45.820 --> 09:48.850
Exactly! And written the names
of the three winning horses

09:48.900 --> 09:51.900
on a piece of paper
inside that envelope.

09:54.620 --> 09:57.490
'Puddle Jumper still on the outside,
Dumb Luck close behind,

09:57.540 --> 09:59.450
'Sailor's Honour striking
out for the lead.'

09:59.500 --> 10:01.130
Sounds like I backed the right horse.

10:01.180 --> 10:02.370
Wait and see.

10:02.420 --> 10:05.210
'.. overtaking Sparrow's Nest,
then Fluffy Duck, Puddle Jumper,

10:05.260 --> 10:07.210
'Sailor's Honour streaking ahead.

10:07.260 --> 10:09.370
'Oh! Sailor's Honour has fallen!

10:09.420 --> 10:13.010
~ 'Sailor's Honour is out of the race.'
~ Sidney!

10:13.060 --> 10:15.370
'And now it's Dumb Luck and
Wackadoodle neck and neck,

10:15.420 --> 10:17.530
'Due North falling back
behind Sparrow's Nest,

10:17.580 --> 10:21.090
'then it's Puddle Jumper,
Fluffy Duck at the rear.

10:21.140 --> 10:23.530
'And now, in the last furlong,
Wackadoodle clawing back

10:23.580 --> 10:25.290
'the distance, pushing
past Dumb Luck,

10:25.340 --> 10:28.050
'and he's crossed the finish line!

10:28.100 --> 10:30.290
'Wackadoodle in first,

10:30.340 --> 10:32.050
'Due North second,

10:32.100 --> 10:33.970
'and Dumb Luck in third.

10:34.020 --> 10:37.090
'What a race! What a race.

10:37.140 --> 10:39.540
'Jockeys and horses alike...'

10:43.540 --> 10:44.970
"First Wackadoodle.

10:45.020 --> 10:46.890
"Second Due North.

10:47.420 --> 10:49.290
"Third Dumb Luck."

10:53.580 --> 10:55.320
Congratulations!

11:06.460 --> 11:07.610
Poppycock!

11:07.660 --> 11:11.570
~ I'm not surprised YOU
don't want to believe it.
~ Meaning?

11:11.620 --> 11:14.730
Meaning I'm almost certain I know
which one of you killed my father.

11:14.780 --> 11:16.650
And you think it was me?

11:16.700 --> 11:18.890
The machine will have
fully charged by 1pm,

11:18.940 --> 11:21.940
allowing me to travel back
a year and find out.

11:23.020 --> 11:24.410
And then what?

11:24.460 --> 11:25.730
Stop the murder?

11:25.780 --> 11:28.770
I can only observe, I
can't change history,

11:28.820 --> 11:31.090
as per temporal modification
negation theory.

11:31.140 --> 11:32.410
Of course.

11:32.460 --> 11:35.690
But I can witness the crime
and confirm my suspicions.

11:35.740 --> 11:37.650
How do you explain the locked doors?

11:37.700 --> 11:40.730
I believe the killer subdued
my father in his lab,

11:40.780 --> 11:42.210
forced him to swallow the poison,

11:42.260 --> 11:46.570
and, then, escaped through the window,
using a rope to climb down.

11:46.620 --> 11:47.890
~ Hmm.
~ Problem?

11:47.940 --> 11:51.050
Well, the killer would've had to
secure the rope to something solid.

11:51.100 --> 11:54.530
~ How would they have got rid of it after...?
~ Perfectly obvious.

11:54.580 --> 11:56.530
In the distraction, after
we entered the room,

11:56.580 --> 11:59.210
they simply untied the rope and
let it fall through the window.

11:59.260 --> 12:02.490
Why would any of us want
to kill your father?

12:02.540 --> 12:03.930
The house.

12:03.980 --> 12:05.090
The house?

12:05.140 --> 12:08.530
My father and uncle each
inherited half the estate.

12:08.580 --> 12:09.850
They wanted to sell it,

12:09.900 --> 12:14.290
in order to finance their
daughters' lust for glory.

12:14.340 --> 12:17.330
But my father was blocking the sale.

12:17.380 --> 12:20.250
We lived here, with my
grandparents, since I was born.

12:20.300 --> 12:22.100
This is OUR home.

12:22.660 --> 12:24.490
Of course, whoever killed him

12:24.540 --> 12:27.650
was too short-sighted to realise
I'd inherit his half.

12:27.700 --> 12:30.410
Your father was well-loved.

12:30.460 --> 12:32.570
He was part of this family.

12:32.620 --> 12:34.650
To even suggest...

12:37.020 --> 12:39.370
I'll make sure she's all right.

12:39.420 --> 12:42.090
I'm not listening to any
more of this nonsense.

12:42.140 --> 12:43.330
You need help.

12:43.380 --> 12:45.330
My brother's death was a tragedy.

12:45.380 --> 12:47.850
You're turning it into a farce!

12:57.220 --> 12:59.650
~ You all right?
~ I'm fine.

12:59.700 --> 13:01.490
If you don't mind me asking,

13:01.540 --> 13:03.970
which of your family do you think...?

13:04.020 --> 13:05.420
My uncle.

13:06.500 --> 13:08.170
The barbarian.

13:10.820 --> 13:13.210
I heard him arguing with
my father in his lab

13:13.260 --> 13:14.890
a few hours before the murder,

13:14.940 --> 13:18.060
my father telling him he was
"going to put a stop to it".

13:19.500 --> 13:21.450
The house sale? What else?

13:21.500 --> 13:22.970
Did you tell the police?

13:23.020 --> 13:24.490
Of course.

13:25.140 --> 13:27.890
But the Inspector, stupid
clod called Valentine,

13:27.940 --> 13:30.340
didn't think it was relevant.

13:31.100 --> 13:33.010
He does make the odd mistake.

13:33.060 --> 13:36.290
Shortly after the argument,
I was sitting there

13:36.340 --> 13:38.340
when I heard a smash.

13:46.220 --> 13:47.420
Dad?

13:48.460 --> 13:50.330
Dad? Dad!

13:50.380 --> 13:52.610
'I ran to the door,
but it was locked.'

13:52.660 --> 13:53.810
Dad, open the door!

13:53.860 --> 13:55.050
'I started banging...'

13:55.100 --> 13:57.090
Dad, if you can hear
me, open the door!

13:57.140 --> 14:00.090
'..calling him. The rest
of the family came running.

14:00.140 --> 14:01.490
'Arnold and I broke through.'

14:01.540 --> 14:02.850
Dad!

14:02.900 --> 14:04.170
'We found him on the floor...'

14:04.220 --> 14:05.210
Dad! Look at me!

14:05.260 --> 14:07.330
'..writhing in agony.'

14:09.220 --> 14:11.490
He was dead within seconds.

14:15.260 --> 14:17.130
'And then I saw it -

14:17.180 --> 14:18.650
'the vial.

14:20.220 --> 14:21.930
'It wasn't suicide.'

14:21.980 --> 14:23.780
It's not logical.

14:24.500 --> 14:28.730
He wasn't depressed.
He was angry, defiant.

14:28.780 --> 14:31.220
Ready to fight for this house.

14:32.660 --> 14:35.760
Does that sound like
a man who kills himself?

15:02.620 --> 15:04.560
How hard can it be?

15:07.740 --> 15:10.050
What do you think you're doing? Off!

15:10.100 --> 15:13.300
All right, fella. Fella,
calm down, calm down.

15:13.860 --> 15:16.860
~ Was only going to take her for a spin.
~ Out.

15:17.340 --> 15:19.730
Listen, when you've done
what you've got to do,

15:19.780 --> 15:21.920
how about you let me...?

15:22.690 --> 15:23.690
How's Georgina?

15:23.740 --> 15:25.810
She wanted to be alone.

15:26.340 --> 15:28.490
I'm sorry for dragging you into this.

15:28.540 --> 15:30.570
If I'd known how far
gone Jacob had...

15:30.620 --> 15:34.520
I don't think Jacob is as far
gone as people think he is.

15:37.540 --> 15:38.810
Damn!

15:44.260 --> 15:45.660
Come on!

16:03.340 --> 16:07.010
You don't seriously think Jacob
has built a time machine?

16:07.060 --> 16:10.930
No, but I don't think he's
necessarily wrong about his father.

16:10.980 --> 16:13.720
I told you, they're not capable of...

16:26.410 --> 16:27.410
Jacob?

16:27.460 --> 16:30.890
If he wants to play his
make-believe games, let him.

16:30.940 --> 16:32.850
~ Oh!
~ Jacob!

16:53.580 --> 16:55.250
He planned to use it go back in time

16:55.300 --> 16:59.170
and prove that his father's suicide,
by strychnine, was, in fact...

16:59.220 --> 17:00.490
murder.

17:00.540 --> 17:03.210
Jacob had some problems.

17:03.260 --> 17:04.930
We should have got him help.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.490
It's not our fault.

17:06.540 --> 17:07.770
There's no suicide note.

17:07.819 --> 17:09.849
History repeating itself.

17:09.900 --> 17:13.930
Of course, the other possibility
is that, if his father WAS murdered,

17:13.980 --> 17:17.569
whoever did it would be afraid
that Jacob was going to expose...

17:17.619 --> 17:20.530
Yes, well, I'd rather not make
any assumptions just yet.

17:20.579 --> 17:22.210
Thank you very much.

17:22.260 --> 17:24.210
In the meantime, Sergeant
Goodfellow, here,

17:24.260 --> 17:26.490
will take your statements downstairs.

17:26.540 --> 17:28.339
This way, please.

17:50.300 --> 17:51.900
Father Brown.

18:09.180 --> 18:10.450
Oh, boy.

18:10.500 --> 18:12.610
I'm sorry.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.730
Are you all right?

18:16.460 --> 18:19.940
As all right as one can be after
a second death in the family.

18:26.900 --> 18:28.570
Were you close to Jacob?

18:28.620 --> 18:30.410
Not particularly.

18:30.460 --> 18:32.410
We didn't have a lot
of common interests.

18:32.460 --> 18:36.330
What about his father? You
seemed very upset earlier.

18:36.380 --> 18:40.610
Well... Well, of course.
The things Jacob was saying.

18:40.660 --> 18:43.740
If you'll excuse me, I don't think
you're telling the whole truth.

18:48.900 --> 18:51.900
What were you apologising
to Frederick for?

18:53.180 --> 18:54.330
It's my fault.

18:54.380 --> 18:55.650
What?

18:56.540 --> 18:58.010
His death?

18:59.540 --> 19:01.860
God, I miss him.

19:04.620 --> 19:07.490
You have no idea what
that feels like.

19:09.940 --> 19:12.340
To be able to say it out loud.

19:17.180 --> 19:19.970
The only thing worse than grief

19:20.020 --> 19:22.020
is having to hide it.

19:22.380 --> 19:23.490
Tell me.

19:23.540 --> 19:24.770
Confession?

19:24.820 --> 19:26.130
If that's what you want.

19:26.180 --> 19:28.290
I'm lapsed.

19:28.340 --> 19:29.620
Ah!

19:30.660 --> 19:33.760
It's never too late
to return to the fold.

19:39.180 --> 19:41.970
Bless me Father, for I have sinned.

19:42.020 --> 19:43.960
It's been ten years.

19:45.540 --> 19:47.210
I'm listening.

19:48.140 --> 19:50.290
I started it.

19:50.340 --> 19:52.450
Seduced him, I suppose.

19:52.500 --> 19:53.690
Why?

19:53.740 --> 19:55.810
When I met Arnold,

19:55.860 --> 19:58.770
he was my dream come true.

19:58.820 --> 20:00.370
Handsome.

20:00.420 --> 20:02.090
Charming.

20:02.140 --> 20:04.210
Champion rugby player.

20:04.780 --> 20:07.450
Until shortly after
the girls were born.

20:07.500 --> 20:09.570
He developed acute arthritis.

20:09.620 --> 20:11.130
For a man like Arnold,

20:11.180 --> 20:13.850
that must've been a bit of a knock.

20:14.660 --> 20:16.570
He became bitter.

20:16.620 --> 20:18.090
Depressed.

20:18.820 --> 20:22.970
He might have snapped out of
it, but then the war came.

20:23.020 --> 20:24.210
He was forced to stay at home,

20:24.260 --> 20:27.170
while his friends died
on the battlefields.

20:27.220 --> 20:30.320
After that, a string
of failed businesses.

20:31.180 --> 20:34.370
By the time financial necessity
required we move here,

20:34.420 --> 20:36.890
he was a shadow of what he was.

20:41.100 --> 20:44.250
I know it's selfish of me, but...

20:44.300 --> 20:46.440
I needed more than that.

20:47.100 --> 20:50.040
How long were you and
Frederick lovers?

20:51.380 --> 20:52.650
Four years.

20:52.700 --> 20:54.490
Did Arnold ever find out?

20:54.540 --> 20:56.890
We were scrupulous in our discretion.

20:56.940 --> 21:00.690
Then why do you blame yourself
for Frederick's death?

21:00.740 --> 21:04.610
When Angelica and Sarah started
to show prowess on the track,

21:04.660 --> 21:06.060
Arnold...

21:07.100 --> 21:11.170
It was as if something
reawakened in him.

21:11.220 --> 21:15.330
He started to pay attention to
his daughters for the first time.

21:15.380 --> 21:16.980
To all of us.

21:18.300 --> 21:20.570
So I plucked up courage...

21:21.100 --> 21:23.700
.. and I ended it with Frederick.

21:25.780 --> 21:27.690
He was devastated.

21:27.740 --> 21:29.930
A week later, he killed himself.

21:29.980 --> 21:31.720
What's going on?

21:32.980 --> 21:35.250
I am offering counselling.

21:36.340 --> 21:37.410
How are the girls?

21:37.460 --> 21:39.170
They're fine.

21:39.220 --> 21:40.960
We're all fine.

21:42.380 --> 21:44.450
We don't need counsel.

21:45.820 --> 21:49.180
Thank you for your concern,
Father, but what we need...

21:50.340 --> 21:52.340
.. is time to grieve.

21:53.180 --> 21:54.450
Alone.

21:55.700 --> 21:56.730
Of course.

21:56.780 --> 21:58.520
Good afternoon.

22:03.380 --> 22:05.570
What was all that about?

22:05.620 --> 22:07.330
Like he said.

22:07.380 --> 22:08.980
Counselling.

22:12.980 --> 22:15.250
It is the most plausible explanation.

22:15.300 --> 22:17.490
You have a very loose
definition of "plausible".

22:17.540 --> 22:21.050
Just a small amount of strychnine
in the bowl of Frederick's pipe -

22:21.100 --> 22:22.810
one puff, that would be enough,

22:22.860 --> 22:24.850
plus conveniently burning
the evidence.

22:24.900 --> 22:26.370
Even if that's how he ingested it,

22:26.420 --> 22:28.490
it doesn't mean he didn't
put it there himself -

22:28.540 --> 22:30.610
evidenced by the vial that
was found beside him.

22:30.660 --> 22:33.410
But the killer could have planted
that in the confusion

22:33.460 --> 22:35.090
after they all entered the room.

22:35.140 --> 22:38.210
Doubly so in the case of Jacob's
murder, with all the smoke.

22:38.260 --> 22:40.100
Here you go, sir.

22:44.100 --> 22:46.020
Sergeant.

22:47.220 --> 22:48.730
So you've reopened the case?

22:48.780 --> 22:49.920
No.

22:51.940 --> 22:54.850
Just reviewing some of
my predecessor's findings.

22:54.900 --> 22:57.090
Does it mention whether
Frederick's pipe

22:57.140 --> 22:58.490
was found at the scene of the...?

22:58.540 --> 23:01.290
~ That's none of your concern, Father.
~ I am just trying to...

23:01.340 --> 23:03.050
Meddle?

23:03.100 --> 23:05.930
Besides, did Jacob even smoke a pipe?

23:05.980 --> 23:09.650
~ I don't recall.
~ So how was the poison administered to him?

23:09.700 --> 23:11.730
I haven't quite worked that out.

23:11.780 --> 23:13.090
Yet.

23:13.140 --> 23:16.730
But I urge you not make the same
mistake as your predecessor

23:16.780 --> 23:20.170
by thinking that Jacob's
murder was suicide.

23:20.220 --> 23:22.770
And I urge you to get on your bike.

23:22.820 --> 23:25.360
Both figuratively and literally.

23:55.340 --> 23:57.250
Strychnine acts in seconds,

23:57.300 --> 24:00.700
so Jacob had to have
ingested it in the room.

24:01.700 --> 24:04.640
~ Oh, good morning, Father.
~ Good morning.

24:05.580 --> 24:08.650
But no food or drink near the body.

24:08.700 --> 24:11.010
~ No tobacco.
~ Oh, you're in one of those.

24:11.060 --> 24:13.210
And no-one near the
room when we arrived.

24:13.260 --> 24:15.170
I'll get started on these accounts

24:15.220 --> 24:18.770
and you can tell me
all about the murders.

24:18.820 --> 24:22.020
~ Sid told me...
~ I think the answer lies in the laboratory.

24:28.140 --> 24:29.370
I'm going back to the house.

24:29.420 --> 24:32.050
~ I don't think that's a very good idea.
~ Why?

24:32.100 --> 24:34.410
If there's a murderer in that family,

24:34.460 --> 24:37.960
there's no telling what
they might do to stop you.

24:38.380 --> 24:41.380
I could always whack
them with my umbrella.

24:41.980 --> 24:44.010
Well, you are not going alone.

24:44.060 --> 24:46.410
Besides, I can help.

24:46.460 --> 24:47.660
How?

24:48.660 --> 24:51.490
I can whack them with my handbag.

24:51.540 --> 24:53.330
And although this takes place

24:53.380 --> 24:56.050
in the shadow of a tragic
death in the family,

24:56.100 --> 24:58.810
we hope our girls will
inspire everyone

24:58.860 --> 25:01.810
who sees them to exult in life,

25:01.860 --> 25:04.370
to perseverate against the odds.

25:04.420 --> 25:07.090
How do you feel about your
sister overtaking you?

25:07.140 --> 25:09.370
I'm very proud of my
sister, but I'd be lying

25:09.420 --> 25:12.370
if I didn't say I'm certain I'll
be beating her to gold in Vancouver.

25:12.420 --> 25:14.450
Not if Helsinki's anything to go by.

25:14.500 --> 25:18.370
Help yourself to the
refreshments, and in 15 minutes,

25:18.420 --> 25:21.050
the sisters will run the track

25:21.100 --> 25:22.640
and show...

25:24.700 --> 25:27.570
.. show you why they are so confident

25:27.620 --> 25:30.210
that they will be
returning from Canada

25:30.260 --> 25:32.170
clutching gold.

25:32.220 --> 25:33.690
Thank you.

25:37.380 --> 25:39.010
Hello. What are you doing here?

25:39.060 --> 25:41.210
Father Brown thinks
one of your friends

25:41.260 --> 25:42.930
is a cold-blooded killer.

25:42.980 --> 25:44.770
I wouldn't put it quite like that.

25:44.820 --> 25:47.370
~ You're persisting with that notion, are you?
~ Yes, I am.

25:47.420 --> 25:50.160
~ Well, I hope you're wrong.
~ So do I.

25:51.380 --> 25:55.020
Mrs McCarthy, would you mind waiting
here and holding the fort?

27:06.500 --> 27:08.700
I'll be back in a minute.

29:06.980 --> 29:09.320
I don't recall inviting you.

29:10.460 --> 29:12.890
Lady Felicia invited me.

29:12.940 --> 29:14.250
Please leave this room.

29:14.300 --> 29:15.770
Of course.

29:16.940 --> 29:19.680
Just one question, if you don't mind.

29:20.260 --> 29:24.460
Jacob said he heard you and his father
arguing before Frederick died.

29:25.780 --> 29:28.180
Was that about the house sale?

29:29.140 --> 29:31.410
Who do you think you are?

29:31.460 --> 29:33.290
Hm?

29:33.340 --> 29:35.410
Some sort of detective?

29:35.780 --> 29:37.520
I said get out.

29:39.220 --> 29:40.650
I'm afraid I can't do that.

29:40.700 --> 29:42.610
And why's that?

29:42.660 --> 29:45.400
Because there's been another murder.

29:51.980 --> 29:54.210
Laces. I mean it this time.

29:54.260 --> 29:56.370
So what do you want
to report? Wormicide?

29:56.420 --> 29:59.250
~ The Inspector'll think you've gone mad.
~ Problem?

29:59.300 --> 30:01.770
Father Brown was snooping
around my house.

30:01.820 --> 30:03.050
Really?

30:03.100 --> 30:05.290
Erm... I got lost on the way
to the little boy's room.

30:05.340 --> 30:08.970
I'd like to see your brother's pipe.

30:09.020 --> 30:10.850
~ What?
~ Frederick's pipe.

30:10.900 --> 30:13.210
It was on the floor when he died.

30:13.260 --> 30:14.690
It's in a box with his belongings.

30:14.740 --> 30:16.690
Look, I really don't
have time for all this.

30:16.740 --> 30:18.280
We'll wait.

30:18.900 --> 30:20.370
So you think I may be right?

30:20.420 --> 30:22.810
I'll know what to think

30:22.860 --> 30:25.290
once I've accumulated
the evidence, Father.

30:25.340 --> 30:27.610
Thank you for your
patience, everybody.

30:27.660 --> 30:30.130
I do believe that Sarah and Angelica

30:30.180 --> 30:32.120
are ready to begin.

30:32.980 --> 30:34.650
On your marks!

30:35.180 --> 30:36.890
Get set!

30:36.940 --> 30:39.880
~ Everything all right?
~ I saw that girl...

30:40.340 --> 30:42.570
Come on, girls!

30:43.820 --> 30:45.290
Very good!

30:51.060 --> 30:53.490
Sarah!

31:10.380 --> 31:12.370
Could it be strychnine poisoning?

31:12.420 --> 31:14.050
Possibly.

31:14.100 --> 31:15.530
Confirm it with a blood test.

31:15.580 --> 31:17.930
So much for the press luncheon.

31:17.980 --> 31:19.770
This is all they'll
be writing about now.

31:19.820 --> 31:21.370
That's the least of our worries.

31:21.420 --> 31:22.810
We need to get you to hospital.

31:22.860 --> 31:24.370
It's just a dizzy spell.

31:24.420 --> 31:27.410
This is a vendetta against this
family. What else could it be?

31:27.460 --> 31:29.890
~ I know who did it.
~ Not now, Mrs McCarthy.

31:29.940 --> 31:33.490
I saw her put something into
her sister's water bottle.

31:33.540 --> 31:35.480
Some kind of powder.

31:36.740 --> 31:38.340
Is this true?

31:41.900 --> 31:43.300
Sergeant.

31:44.100 --> 31:45.970
Miss Francis!

31:46.020 --> 31:47.620
Miss Francis!

32:23.500 --> 32:24.730
I don't even like running.

32:24.780 --> 32:26.970
~ Then why do it?
~ Why do you think?

32:27.020 --> 32:28.650
For your father.

32:28.700 --> 32:30.840
It's all he cares about.

32:31.180 --> 32:32.930
The only person in this entire family

32:32.980 --> 32:36.530
who didn't treat me like second
best was Uncle Frederick.

32:36.580 --> 32:39.850
He helped me with my
school science homework.

32:39.900 --> 32:41.840
Said I had aptitude.

32:44.380 --> 32:46.090
I didn't kill him.

32:46.140 --> 32:47.850
Or Jacob.

32:47.900 --> 32:51.100
Then what did you put
in Sarah's water bottle?

32:56.180 --> 32:59.090
Laxatives.

32:59.140 --> 33:02.380
That would've given the press
something to write about.

33:03.780 --> 33:05.090
She only took a swig.

33:05.140 --> 33:07.680
Wouldn't have made her collapse.

33:08.140 --> 33:11.660
Then the strychnine must already
have been in the water...

33:12.660 --> 33:15.490
Angelica Francis, I am arresting
you on suspicion of murder.

33:15.540 --> 33:18.290
You are not obliged to say anything,
unless you wish to do so,

33:18.340 --> 33:20.210
but what you say will
be taken down in writing

33:20.260 --> 33:22.660
and may be given in evidence.

33:25.820 --> 33:29.210
Please, I didn't do it.
I didn't do anything.

33:29.260 --> 33:31.690
You're not taking my
daughter anywhere!

33:31.740 --> 33:33.170
I'm afraid you don't have a say.

33:33.220 --> 33:36.090
Not until I've telephoned
a solicitor.

33:37.220 --> 33:38.650
You're making a mistake.

33:38.700 --> 33:40.890
Please, Inspector.

33:40.940 --> 33:43.250
Now, aren't you glad
you brought me along?

33:43.300 --> 33:45.090
I almost solved the whole thi...

33:45.140 --> 33:48.570
Isn't it curious that Sarah
survived strychnine poisoning,

33:48.620 --> 33:51.360
but her uncle and her cousin didn't?

33:51.900 --> 33:54.930
Well, maybe she has a
stronger constitution.

33:54.980 --> 33:57.380
She is an athlete, after all.

33:59.660 --> 34:01.930
The poison is in the dose.

34:02.340 --> 34:04.330
And in small doses...

34:04.380 --> 34:07.100
Mrs McCarthy, well done.

34:25.139 --> 34:27.739
"Sarah Francis - Training times."

34:28.620 --> 34:30.570
0.1mg,

34:30.620 --> 34:32.969
0.25mg,

34:33.020 --> 34:34.420
0.75mg.

34:35.620 --> 34:37.250
What's that?

34:37.300 --> 34:39.260
A whopper of a clue.

34:45.739 --> 34:47.810
So you know who did it?

34:50.580 --> 34:52.090
Not quite.

34:52.139 --> 34:54.370
But you do know how it was done?

34:54.420 --> 34:58.650
Not exactly. But I think it's
something to do with these worms.

34:58.700 --> 35:00.570
Worms, what worms?

35:01.420 --> 35:04.890
Mrs McCarthy, would you
mind waiting outside?

35:04.940 --> 35:07.580
I'd like to conduct an experiment.

35:36.460 --> 35:38.370
The solicitor's on his way.

35:38.420 --> 35:41.520
She's not going anywhere
until he gets here.

35:48.820 --> 35:50.290
What in the blazes...?

35:50.340 --> 35:53.970
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

35:57.660 --> 35:59.210
Just a spot of time travel.

35:59.260 --> 36:01.370
You think this is some kind of joke?

36:01.420 --> 36:02.970
On the contrary.

36:03.020 --> 36:05.730
I think it's deadly serious,
after what I've just witnessed.

36:05.780 --> 36:06.810
Which was what?

36:06.860 --> 36:08.130
Two murders.

36:08.180 --> 36:10.410
First Frederick, and then Jacob.

36:10.460 --> 36:12.810
You mean... that thing really works?

36:12.860 --> 36:15.970
Jacob was troubled, but
was clearly a genius.

36:16.020 --> 36:17.210
You've been back in time?

36:17.260 --> 36:19.210
Twice.

36:19.260 --> 36:22.050
I hid in the corner a year ago.

36:22.100 --> 36:24.490
I witnessed the murderer
put strychnine

36:24.540 --> 36:26.290
in the bowl of Frederick's pipe.

36:26.340 --> 36:29.770
And then, yesterday, the
culprit put the poison

36:29.820 --> 36:32.290
in the cooling fan so Jacob
would've inhaled it

36:32.340 --> 36:33.930
when he turned on his machine,

36:33.980 --> 36:37.330
which also explains why some
of the strychnine fragments

36:37.380 --> 36:39.520
went into the worm tank.

36:41.660 --> 36:44.930
In both cases, I think
we can safely assume

36:44.980 --> 36:48.370
the killer discreetly
planted the vial

36:48.420 --> 36:50.330
after they entered the room.

36:50.380 --> 36:52.490
So, who was it, then?

36:52.540 --> 36:55.610
Jacob said he heard you
arguing with Frederick.

36:55.660 --> 36:57.090
"I'll put a stop to it," he said,

36:57.140 --> 37:00.640
but he wasn't talking about
the house sale, was he?

37:01.500 --> 37:03.850
He was talking about you.

37:03.900 --> 37:07.290
You've been using strychnine
to enhance your performance.

37:07.340 --> 37:08.930
That's ridiculous.

37:08.980 --> 37:11.050
Only this afternoon...

37:11.100 --> 37:12.610
you took too much.

37:12.660 --> 37:15.260
Do you have any evidence of this?

37:17.180 --> 37:18.370
It's all in there.

37:18.420 --> 37:20.410
That's private property. You can't!

37:20.460 --> 37:22.370
You knew about this?!

37:22.420 --> 37:24.260
Mr Francis?

37:25.380 --> 37:28.120
I only found out after the Olympics.

37:28.740 --> 37:32.210
Frederick told me he found her
stealing strychnine from his lab.

37:32.260 --> 37:36.570
~ You cheating...!
~ You swore to me that
you'd never do this again.

37:36.620 --> 37:40.090
Frederick was going to inform
the Olympic Committee.

37:40.140 --> 37:42.490
She'd have been stripped
of her silver.

37:42.540 --> 37:44.380
Shamed.

37:49.940 --> 37:52.290
Which gave you both of you
a motive for killing Frederick

37:52.340 --> 37:54.880
and stopping Jacob revealing it.

37:56.220 --> 37:59.290
The only question is
which one of you did it?

37:59.340 --> 38:00.530
Following Jacob's lead,

38:00.580 --> 38:03.330
I've written the killer's name

38:03.380 --> 38:05.180
in this envelope.

38:15.740 --> 38:18.410
~ No, don't!
~ Don't do it!
~ Stop her!

38:21.220 --> 38:24.090
'Wackadoodle clawing back the
distance, pushing past Dumb Luck.

38:24.140 --> 38:25.650
'And he's crossed the finish line!

38:25.700 --> 38:27.050
'Wackadoodle in first,

38:27.100 --> 38:28.490
'Due North second

38:28.540 --> 38:30.570
'and Dumb Luck in third.'

38:30.620 --> 38:32.560
I don't understand.

38:37.260 --> 38:40.730
Jacob recorded the race minutes
before we entered the room,

38:40.780 --> 38:44.130
then he switched the radios
after the demonstration.

38:44.180 --> 38:46.970
And I switched them back again.

38:47.020 --> 38:49.690
But the race started
after we entered.

38:49.740 --> 38:51.010
To complete the illusion,

38:51.060 --> 38:56.050
he set every single clock in
the house seven minutes early.

38:56.100 --> 38:59.170
The rest was just theatrics -

38:59.220 --> 39:02.810
electricity and dry ice.

39:02.860 --> 39:05.960
All with the aim of flushing
the killer out.

39:07.220 --> 39:10.500
Sadly, it worked too well.

39:13.980 --> 39:15.490
I prayed that it wasn't true.

39:15.540 --> 39:17.210
How could you?

39:22.260 --> 39:23.570
Sarah!

39:23.620 --> 39:25.760
Miss Francis, come back!

39:26.820 --> 39:28.730
Hey, stop there!

39:28.780 --> 39:29.770
Stop!

39:29.820 --> 39:32.560
~ Look, there's nowhere to go!
~ Sarah!

39:33.900 --> 39:35.290
Put it down, Sarah!

39:35.340 --> 39:36.690
Don't come any closer.

39:36.740 --> 39:37.890
Sarah, please!

39:37.940 --> 39:39.290
I'm not going to prison.

39:39.340 --> 39:41.970
~ Sarah!
~ Listen to your family.

39:42.020 --> 39:44.290
~ Sarah!
~ Or what?

39:44.340 --> 39:46.080
I'll go to hell?

39:47.220 --> 39:48.850
Is that what you think?

39:48.900 --> 39:50.130
Where else am I going?

39:50.180 --> 39:51.850
Well, it's up to you.

39:51.900 --> 39:54.090
I'm past redemption, Father.

39:54.140 --> 39:56.490
I've killed two people.

39:56.540 --> 39:58.930
Faked their suicides.

39:58.980 --> 40:01.210
Maybe a real one is what I deserve.

40:01.260 --> 40:04.690
You deserve understanding,
like anyone else.

40:04.740 --> 40:06.130
To do what you've done,

40:06.180 --> 40:09.410
I can only imagine how terrified
you must have been.

40:09.460 --> 40:10.930
Terrified?

40:13.220 --> 40:14.620
Of what?

40:15.900 --> 40:17.300
Tell him.

40:19.740 --> 40:21.850
You only love champions.

40:21.900 --> 40:23.770
Don't you dare try
to blame this on me.

40:23.820 --> 40:25.340
It's true.

40:29.300 --> 40:31.940
Sarah, put it down, please.

40:38.980 --> 40:41.330
I love you, no matter what.

40:41.380 --> 40:42.980
Both of you.

40:45.860 --> 40:48.460
If I've made you feel less than...

40:49.780 --> 40:51.250
.. less...

40:53.300 --> 40:55.700
You're both so precious to me.

40:56.820 --> 40:58.360
All of you.

41:00.020 --> 41:02.620
I'm sorry I find it so difficult.

41:06.860 --> 41:08.330
I'm sorry.

41:10.420 --> 41:12.090
Oh, I'm sorry.

41:41.700 --> 41:42.890
Morning.

41:42.940 --> 41:44.850
Ah, Inspector, what
a pleasant surprise.

41:44.900 --> 41:46.490
No need to look so happy, Father.

41:46.540 --> 41:48.810
I'm not here to convert.

41:48.860 --> 41:51.370
I've been meaning to
ask you about this.

41:51.420 --> 41:54.130
Admittedly, I wasn't 100% sure

41:54.180 --> 41:56.370
whether it was Arnold or Sarah,

41:56.420 --> 41:58.810
but I was sure

41:58.860 --> 42:02.010
that if the culprit believed
the time machine was real...

42:02.060 --> 42:04.850
They wouldn't miss a last
chance to save themselves.

42:04.900 --> 42:06.300
Exactly.

42:07.420 --> 42:09.290
I suppose this is one
of the rare instances

42:09.340 --> 42:10.810
where my meddling has proved...

42:10.860 --> 42:12.450
Meddlesome?

42:12.500 --> 42:13.900
As usual.

42:15.700 --> 42:17.650
Good day.

42:17.700 --> 42:19.210
Ah!

42:19.260 --> 42:21.370
Another pleasant surprise.

42:21.420 --> 42:22.730
How are you both?

42:22.780 --> 42:25.450
Adapting to new circumstances.

42:25.500 --> 42:28.290
I'm starting university in
the autumn. Natural sciences.

42:28.340 --> 42:29.690
Congratulations.

42:29.740 --> 42:31.570
Sarah's trial should be over by then.

42:31.620 --> 42:32.690
How is she?

42:32.740 --> 42:34.130
Coping.

42:34.180 --> 42:35.650
Barrister's arguing that

42:35.700 --> 42:38.850
~ the strychnine may have
impaired her mental state.
~ Mm.

42:38.900 --> 42:41.090
Diminished responsibility.

42:41.140 --> 42:42.450
And your husband?

42:42.500 --> 42:44.570
Angelica, wait inside.

42:47.620 --> 42:50.050
I told him about Frederick and I.

42:50.100 --> 42:52.010
If there's one thing I've learned,

42:52.060 --> 42:54.800
the fewer family secrets, the better.

42:55.980 --> 42:57.920
How did he take it?

43:00.980 --> 43:02.320
Father.

43:05.180 --> 43:06.540
We'll be fine.
