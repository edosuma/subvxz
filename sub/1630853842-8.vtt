WEBVTT

00:28.361 --> 00:30.071
You are welcome here, Rose Walker.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.033
Who are you?

00:33.616 --> 00:37.579
You have somehow dreamed your way
into an audience with Lord Morpheus.

00:38.788 --> 00:40.290
The King of Dreams.

00:41.249 --> 00:42.834
-And now you must go.
-Lucienne.

00:42.917 --> 00:44.794
She shouldn't be here.

00:45.295 --> 00:48.965
No, but I should like her to stay.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.470
What is this place?

00:54.095 --> 00:55.430
You're in The Dreaming,

00:56.097 --> 00:57.891
the place where
people come when they sleep.

01:00.143 --> 01:03.063
So, I'm asleep right now? I'm dreaming?

01:03.146 --> 01:07.484
Yes, and I should like to know
how it is you found me.

01:08.151 --> 01:11.029
I heard you talking about my brother.
Is he here?

01:12.655 --> 01:13.531
No.

01:14.407 --> 01:15.992
Do you know where he is?

01:16.868 --> 01:17.702
No.

01:21.331 --> 01:24.667
But I think he might be with
one of my missing Nightmares.

01:27.462 --> 01:29.422
She's a nightmare?

01:30.590 --> 01:32.258
What would she want with Jed?

01:32.342 --> 01:33.301
I don't know.

01:34.844 --> 01:37.180
But I have a feeling
it has something to do with you.

01:37.764 --> 01:41.518
Me? Why? What did I do?

01:41.601 --> 01:45.271
It is not what you did.
It is what you are.

01:46.689 --> 01:49.442
I'm sorry. I don't understand any of this.

01:49.526 --> 01:50.401
No.

01:50.985 --> 01:54.197
Dream vortexes
are largely incomprehensible.

01:54.989 --> 01:56.241
What's a dream vortex?

01:57.075 --> 01:58.409
You are.

01:58.493 --> 02:00.787
You see, once every few thousand years,

02:00.870 --> 02:04.582
a mortal is born with
a dreaming ability so powerful,

02:05.083 --> 02:07.794
she can travel
through the dreams of others.

02:08.378 --> 02:10.255
Apparently, all the way to my throne room.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.882
I was just looking for my brother.

02:12.966 --> 02:17.137
If you can find me in The Dreaming,
you can find your brother.

02:17.220 --> 02:19.264
No matter where Gault has hidden him.

02:20.557 --> 02:22.976
How? How do I do that?

02:23.059 --> 02:27.522
For now, keep looking for your brother
in the waking world.

02:28.439 --> 02:30.150
Matthew will watch over you there.

02:30.233 --> 02:32.235
At your service, Rose.

02:33.570 --> 02:36.656
When he is with you, I am with you.

02:37.365 --> 02:39.200
Then tonight, when you sleep,

02:39.284 --> 02:42.745
you and I will go in search
for Gault and your brother together.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.373
In your dreams.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.460
She's just a nightmare, right?

02:49.544 --> 02:52.380
She can't hurt him, can she?

03:11.274 --> 03:13.526
Which one of my enemies is it this time?

03:14.444 --> 03:15.945
Johnny Sorrow?

03:16.446 --> 03:17.947
The Phantom of the Fair?

03:18.448 --> 03:20.325
Or is Doctor Death back for more?

03:27.040 --> 03:28.499
It's the Pied Piper.

03:28.583 --> 03:32.670
He appears to be using
next-gen sonic technology

03:33.213 --> 03:35.798
to control all the area's children.

03:37.967 --> 03:39.802
This looks like a job for…

03:44.140 --> 03:45.016
The Sandman.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.687
Time I put the Piper to bed.

04:10.750 --> 04:14.045
No sign of the Piper. No sign of anyone.

04:15.463 --> 04:18.883
I'm afraid we're too late.
They've all been kidnapped.

04:23.554 --> 04:24.597
Wait.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.059
Can you hear that?

04:28.142 --> 04:29.310
The Pipers' tune.

04:30.228 --> 04:31.854
Can you hear where it's coming from?

04:34.524 --> 04:36.109
I can.

04:46.160 --> 04:47.328
Are you seeing this?

04:50.581 --> 04:52.834
I am,
and I don't like what I'm seeing.

04:52.917 --> 04:54.294
Return to base, Sandman.

04:55.628 --> 04:56.546
Don't worry.

05:00.842 --> 05:01.718
I've got this.

05:08.182 --> 05:09.100
Rats!

05:12.437 --> 05:14.188
Get back here, Jed. Right now.

05:14.272 --> 05:16.190
There's too many of them! Ahh!

05:19.110 --> 05:21.070
-Help!
-I'm trying, Jed, hold on.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.196
-No!
-Jed!

05:22.280 --> 05:23.573
-Please help!
-Jed!

06:01.152 --> 06:02.612
Aunt Clarice?

06:04.489 --> 06:06.032
Uncle Barnaby?

06:09.619 --> 06:11.287
I-I-I think I'm hurt.

06:13.039 --> 06:14.332
Is anyone there?

06:16.793 --> 06:17.627
Don't.

06:21.547 --> 06:23.341
We can't just leave him down there.

06:23.424 --> 06:26.928
The second you open that door,
he's gonna run away again.

06:30.014 --> 06:31.099
He has to learn.

06:39.440 --> 06:40.733
Aunt Clarice?

06:46.823 --> 06:47.990
Is anyone there?

07:10.805 --> 07:11.639
Matthew?

07:25.403 --> 07:27.738
Unity, hi. It's Rose calling.

07:27.822 --> 07:28.906
How are you, darling?

07:29.615 --> 07:32.577
How was it with the foster agent?
Was she awful?

07:33.161 --> 07:35.163
Well, she wouldn't tell us where Jed is.

07:35.246 --> 07:36.664
Oh, no, of course not.

07:37.248 --> 07:38.958
That would have made it far too easy.

07:39.041 --> 07:40.543
But she did tell us one thing.

07:40.626 --> 07:44.088
Apparently, Jed's foster parents
were friends of my dad's.

07:44.172 --> 07:46.340
So, she told you quite a bit.

07:47.008 --> 07:48.926
Do you remember your father's friends?

07:50.052 --> 07:52.763
No, but if it's okay with you,

07:52.847 --> 07:54.765
I thought I'd stay longer and maybe…

07:54.849 --> 07:57.268
Oh, of course, love. Of course, Rose.

07:57.351 --> 07:59.437
-May I?
-Please.

08:00.104 --> 08:02.857
Unity, am I interrupting something?

08:04.150 --> 08:06.861
There is a lovely young journalist here

08:06.944 --> 08:09.572
who wants to interview me
about the sleepy sickness.

08:09.655 --> 08:10.823
Unity.

08:10.907 --> 08:15.077
I keep telling him,
I slept through the entire thing.

08:15.912 --> 08:18.789
I'm hanging up now. Enjoy being famous.

08:20.958 --> 08:23.544
That was my great-granddaughter, Rose.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.421
Oh. Is she in London?

08:25.505 --> 08:26.923
She was.

08:27.006 --> 08:30.426
Now she's back in the United States.
In Florida.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.346
Really? Whereabouts in Florida?

08:34.305 --> 08:36.349
A town called Cape Kennedy.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.228
You sound American to me. Have you been?

08:40.895 --> 08:44.565
Cape Kennedy? No.
But now I'll have to visit.

08:58.162 --> 08:59.747
Did you figure out the printer?

08:59.830 --> 09:00.706
I did.

09:02.083 --> 09:02.959
What do you think?

09:04.001 --> 09:04.835
Oh.

09:05.628 --> 09:07.713
I think I wanna help you
put these up all over town.

09:07.797 --> 09:09.090
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

09:09.173 --> 09:10.841
-Can I pay you for them?
-You already did.

09:10.925 --> 09:12.176
I overcharged you for the room.

09:13.094 --> 09:13.928
May I see?

09:15.429 --> 09:16.430
Morning!

09:16.514 --> 09:18.975
Oh, my gosh. Rose!

09:19.559 --> 09:21.686
Oh, look at you guys. Can I have some?

09:21.769 --> 09:23.563
Uh, babe. What are you doin'?

09:23.646 --> 09:24.522
Putting these up.

09:24.605 --> 09:26.399
Yeah, but we're out all day with Sindy.

09:26.482 --> 09:29.652
Sindy can put some up too.
She's our realtor. She's fabulous.

09:30.736 --> 09:31.779
Thank you, guys.

09:34.156 --> 09:36.033
Zelda suggests we take some as well.

09:36.117 --> 09:37.243
Thank you.

09:37.326 --> 09:39.287
We can all hit the streets
when Lyta wakes up.

09:39.370 --> 09:40.538
She's still asleep?

09:49.714 --> 09:51.549
I just wanna stay like this forever.

09:55.011 --> 09:56.429
I do too, but…

09:57.346 --> 09:58.180
What?

09:58.931 --> 10:01.934
You should be out,
living your actual life,

10:02.018 --> 10:05.438
not having ghost-sex
with your dead husband.

10:05.938 --> 10:08.774
You're not a ghost, you're a dream.

10:10.985 --> 10:11.819
Yeah.

10:12.903 --> 10:15.114
Been meaning to talk to you about that.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.409
If I were a dream,

10:19.452 --> 10:22.079
wouldn't I disappear when you wake up?

10:23.706 --> 10:24.790
-Don't you?
-No.

10:26.208 --> 10:27.418
Then what do you do?

10:27.501 --> 10:30.421
I go to work. I… I cook. I work out--

10:30.504 --> 10:31.756
You go to work?

10:33.841 --> 10:34.675
Yeah.

10:34.759 --> 10:35.968
Doing what?

10:42.391 --> 10:44.518
I finally built our house.

10:45.353 --> 10:46.270
Can I show you?

11:05.665 --> 11:08.084
You… You built our house?

11:10.294 --> 11:12.630
Come on. I'll give you the tour.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.819
I did my best to follow your blueprints,

11:34.902 --> 11:38.197
but there were a few details
I, I just couldn't remember.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.407
It's perfect.

11:45.788 --> 11:46.956
What's in there?

11:47.039 --> 11:49.875
Uh, that room's not quite finished yet.

12:07.309 --> 12:08.686
Why did you build this?

12:12.106 --> 12:13.441
Because it was our dream.

12:17.361 --> 12:20.698
And now that we're both here,
maybe it can come true.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.074
How?

12:23.492 --> 12:24.785
You have to stay with me.

12:26.328 --> 12:27.204
Here.

12:28.164 --> 12:29.832
In our house, the way we planned.

12:33.043 --> 12:33.878
Sweetie.

12:38.549 --> 12:41.051
You know eventually I have to wake up.

13:03.449 --> 13:04.325
You're awake.

13:05.201 --> 13:06.035
Yeah.

13:07.495 --> 13:08.996
-You okay?
-Yeah.

13:10.748 --> 13:11.791
What are those?

13:14.001 --> 13:15.294
Is this a terrible idea?

13:19.340 --> 13:21.008
No, not at all.

13:21.592 --> 13:25.429
'Cause I was thinking, we could put up
a few near the foster agency?

13:25.513 --> 13:27.598
Just to let that woman know
we're not giving up.

13:27.681 --> 13:29.767
No, I think she probably got that
from yesterday.

13:29.850 --> 13:31.268
Was I that bad?

13:31.894 --> 13:33.979
-Should I go there and apologize?
-No.

13:35.022 --> 13:37.608
But why don't you let me
do that side of town?

13:41.904 --> 13:44.657
My lord, may I help?

13:44.740 --> 13:46.867
Is this everything
we have on Rose Walker?

13:46.951 --> 13:47.952
And Jed Walker.

13:48.035 --> 13:51.330
But I shouldn't think there's anything
in those you don't already know.

13:51.413 --> 13:52.248
Except perhaps--

13:52.331 --> 13:54.959
Except perhaps why she was able
to wander into my throne room.

13:55.042 --> 13:56.544
What do you think?

13:56.627 --> 13:59.338
Why did Gault target her brother
and not her?

14:00.297 --> 14:02.091
Did you read about Unity Kincaid?

14:03.175 --> 14:04.677
The day you were imprisoned,

14:04.760 --> 14:08.931
there were people all over the world
who fell asleep and could not wake up.

14:09.765 --> 14:14.812
Unity Kincaid is the sole survivor
of what they called the "sleepy sickness."

14:15.729 --> 14:18.816
The day you returned, she woke up.

14:19.525 --> 14:22.111
Rose Walker is her great-granddaughter.

14:24.572 --> 14:28.617
Which would seem to suggest that
my absence caused the birth of a vortex.

14:29.201 --> 14:30.619
Is that not a possibility?

14:30.703 --> 14:33.163
Vortexes are
naturally occurring phenomena.

14:33.247 --> 14:35.207
No one knows why they happen.
Not even I know.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.293
But I do know
they are not caused or created.

14:37.376 --> 14:39.461
They simply happen.

14:40.379 --> 14:44.216
Then this is all a coincidence?
And not an imminent threat?

14:44.300 --> 14:48.137
My instinct says no, but tonight
when Rose Walker sleeps,

14:48.220 --> 14:50.681
I shall see it more clearly. May I?

14:52.182 --> 14:53.017
Of course.

14:54.518 --> 14:56.979
I've been trying to
remember my dad's friends,

14:57.062 --> 14:59.565
but I don't think he had any.

15:01.191 --> 15:02.776
He was a pretty unfriendly guy.

15:02.860 --> 15:07.031
Well, do you remember any golf buddies,
or drinking buddies, or…

15:07.114 --> 15:10.492
What else do
married straight men with kids do?

15:10.576 --> 15:13.746
Well, if they're anything like my dad,
they have affairs.

15:14.330 --> 15:15.539
Oh.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.499
That's why your mom divorced him.

15:18.042 --> 15:19.293
That was just one reason.

15:20.127 --> 15:21.962
Maybe your dad didn't have friends.

15:22.046 --> 15:24.298
That's why I thought
we'd start with his neighbors.

15:25.132 --> 15:28.135
That was his house. Our house.

15:29.470 --> 15:34.600
The last time I saw Jed was right there,
seven years ago.

15:35.893 --> 15:37.269
You haven't seen him since?

15:39.104 --> 15:43.817
When my mom got a job in New Jersey,
my dad cut us off completely.

15:44.860 --> 15:47.821
Stopped paying alimony, child support.

15:48.864 --> 15:51.241
He wouldn't let us see
or even talk to Jed.

15:51.325 --> 15:52.368
Hmm.

15:59.792 --> 16:00.918
My mom sued.

16:01.001 --> 16:05.381
She never gave up,
but I went off to college.

16:08.550 --> 16:10.260
I haven't been a very good sister.

16:10.761 --> 16:12.972
Mm, you're making up for it now, though.

16:13.806 --> 16:14.765
I'm trying.

16:17.810 --> 16:18.769
Come in.

16:19.853 --> 16:20.938
Hi, Ms. Rubio.

16:22.398 --> 16:24.942
I'm Lyta Hall. Rose Walker's friend.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.778
What can I do for you, Ms. Hall?

16:30.990 --> 16:33.617
I just wanted to come by
and apologize for yesterday.

16:34.910 --> 16:36.620
I know your job is hard enough

16:36.704 --> 16:40.791
without having to deal with
other people's, uh, grief.

16:41.667 --> 16:44.086
'Cause that's what it was. It wasn't you.

16:45.462 --> 16:46.880
Rose wanted to come by but--

16:46.964 --> 16:50.259
But she is out looking for her brother.

16:55.764 --> 16:58.475
I think she really just
wants to know if he's okay.

16:58.559 --> 17:00.227
I'm sure he is.

17:02.062 --> 17:06.358
Is there any way you could find out?
Check up on him?

17:06.442 --> 17:07.651
You wouldn't have to tell us.

17:07.735 --> 17:13.073
I don't wanna get you in trouble,
but do you do follow-up visits?

17:13.157 --> 17:15.868
We do. But I can't just--

17:15.951 --> 17:17.911
No, I understand.

17:19.288 --> 17:20.289
I'm sorry.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.000
That's really all I came here to say.

17:25.544 --> 17:28.005
Thank you, Ms. Rubio, for your time.

17:54.698 --> 17:57.451
The woman from the foster agency
wants to come by.

17:58.410 --> 17:59.286
For what?

18:00.370 --> 18:02.456
-To check on Jed.
-What?

18:03.248 --> 18:04.625
Why now, all of a sudden?

18:06.001 --> 18:09.630
It's a… They do that.
It's a regular thing.

18:10.798 --> 18:11.924
What did you tell her?

18:13.592 --> 18:16.512
Well, I couldn't tell her no.

18:16.595 --> 18:17.513
I can.

18:18.055 --> 18:19.348
Call her back.

18:22.476 --> 18:24.103
Fine, I'll do it.

18:25.729 --> 18:28.482
You don't think
that's gonna raise a red flag?

18:33.237 --> 18:37.199
If you don't want him here,
we can give him back.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.662
I'm not giving back $800 a month.

18:44.373 --> 18:45.374
Get him up here.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.585
I'll talk to him.
I'll make sure he doesn't run away again.

18:48.669 --> 18:51.547
No. I'll talk to him.

18:59.596 --> 19:00.931
Come on up, Jed.

19:04.226 --> 19:05.644
-You're all right.

19:17.614 --> 19:20.617
The woman from the foster agency's
coming to check up on you.

19:22.161 --> 19:25.497
If you're good,
you can sleep in your own bed tonight.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.627
But if you embarrass us
in front of this woman,

19:31.378 --> 19:33.255
I will take you back into the cellar.

19:34.298 --> 19:36.967
I will wire your hands to
the pipes down there,

19:38.510 --> 19:40.846
and I will break every bone in your body.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.058
Do you understand me, Jed?

19:47.436 --> 19:48.770
Then go clean yourself up.

19:53.942 --> 19:57.279
Here. I'll fix you something to eat.

20:18.091 --> 20:19.968
I mean, I tried to escape.

20:20.052 --> 20:25.682
I went directly to New York after college
to have a huge Broadway career,

20:26.433 --> 20:29.394
before moving on to film
and television, of course.

20:29.478 --> 20:30.395
Of course.

20:30.938 --> 20:32.940
But, you know, these days,

20:33.023 --> 20:35.525
if you're not already
a film or television star,

20:35.609 --> 20:37.611
you can't even get a job on Broadway.

20:37.694 --> 20:39.446
So, when my grandmother died

20:39.529 --> 20:43.742
and left me that ridiculous house,
I came home.

20:44.451 --> 20:45.869
Do you miss New York?

20:46.578 --> 20:49.289
-Not as much as I thought I would.
-Hmm.

20:49.373 --> 20:52.960
I mean, New York's very hard,
and this place is not so bad.

20:59.258 --> 21:02.135
I'm gonna put a few up over there.

21:02.219 --> 21:03.929
So if you maybe want to…

21:04.012 --> 21:05.973
Yeah, absolutely. I'll catch up with you.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.738
Matthew, is that you?

21:24.783 --> 21:26.326
No, that's a crow.

21:28.912 --> 21:31.957
I'm a raven. Common mistake.

21:34.334 --> 21:35.335
You're real?

21:36.253 --> 21:39.089
Technically I'm a dream, but sure.

21:40.716 --> 21:43.176
And is Morpheus watching right now?

21:43.260 --> 21:45.595
He is. I can feel him
in the back of my head.

21:45.679 --> 21:46.847
It's the weirdest feeling.

21:46.930 --> 21:47.764
Fuck.

21:47.848 --> 21:49.182
Do you need him?

21:49.808 --> 21:53.770
No, but he said
he'd be there tonight when I fall asleep.

21:53.854 --> 21:55.647
He's gonna help me find my brother.

21:55.731 --> 21:56.898
That's the plan.

21:56.982 --> 21:58.900
And I'll be around till then
if you need me.

21:59.443 --> 22:00.319
Thank you.

22:01.069 --> 22:01.987
You got it, kid.

22:07.242 --> 22:11.038
…Jed Walker. If you see him
or know anything about him, just text.

22:12.664 --> 22:14.124
Okay. Thanks.

22:14.750 --> 22:16.293
What have you got there?

22:17.919 --> 22:18.879
Hi.

22:18.962 --> 22:22.257
Uh, we're looking
for a kid named Jed Walker.

22:22.341 --> 22:23.925
He would be about 12 now.

22:24.051 --> 22:25.886
Oh. How long has he been missing?

22:25.969 --> 22:28.221
Well, he's not actually missing.
He's in foster care.

22:28.305 --> 22:31.016
But the agency won't tell us where.

22:31.516 --> 22:33.935
-Would you mind if I kept this?
-No, not at all.

22:34.019 --> 22:35.896
Mm. See you around.

22:35.979 --> 22:37.606
Yeah, I hope so.

22:41.151 --> 22:42.319
Friend of yours?

22:43.111 --> 22:47.074
No, but he took a flier,
so he might be calling.

22:47.157 --> 22:49.326
Mm-hmm. I'll give him your number.

22:49.409 --> 22:52.746
You're a good friend, Rose Walker.

22:55.665 --> 22:57.626
He's doing great in school.

22:59.753 --> 23:01.213
Helps out around the house.

23:02.047 --> 23:03.340
Never complains.

23:04.174 --> 23:05.842
I don't know what we'd do without him.

23:06.426 --> 23:07.469
Right, Barn?

23:09.221 --> 23:10.347
That's right.

23:10.430 --> 23:11.932
I'm so happy to hear that.

23:12.808 --> 23:14.309
You look good, Jed.

23:14.393 --> 23:15.727
You look happy.

23:16.311 --> 23:17.270
Thank you, ma'am.

23:20.440 --> 23:23.193
I wonder if I might have
a moment alone with you both.

23:24.194 --> 23:26.029
It's just some admin updates.

23:28.990 --> 23:30.575
You wanna go to your room, son?

23:42.629 --> 23:44.589
It's all pretty straightforward.

23:44.673 --> 23:48.135
I just need to update Jed's file
with all his current information.

23:48.218 --> 23:51.221
His school, insurance.
All the usual stuff.

23:53.014 --> 23:55.350
Is he still in Callow Elementary?

23:55.851 --> 23:57.394
So good to see you, Ms. Rubio.

24:01.064 --> 24:01.898
Oh.

24:04.943 --> 24:06.528
It's good to see you too, Jed.

24:28.592 --> 24:31.386
Hello. How can I help you?

24:31.470 --> 24:32.846
I have a question for you.

24:35.557 --> 24:37.142
Have you seen this boy?

24:41.062 --> 24:44.774
Your Aunt Clarice and I
want you to know we were very impressed.

24:46.776 --> 24:51.364
With the way you got this note
into that lady's bag.

24:54.576 --> 24:55.494
I'm sorry.

24:56.077 --> 24:57.329
No, you're not.

25:03.001 --> 25:04.044
But you will be.

25:30.320 --> 25:31.363
Hmm.

25:39.955 --> 25:41.206
Where is everyone?

25:41.289 --> 25:43.291
They must have all gone to bed.

25:43.375 --> 25:46.878
There's not much to do
in Cape Kennedy after dark.

25:48.129 --> 25:49.923
Or during the day for that matter.

25:50.465 --> 25:52.300
That's kinda what I like about it.

25:53.343 --> 25:56.221
I was thinking, maybe I should move back.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.766
Why? To do what?

26:00.600 --> 26:01.434
I don't know.

26:02.018 --> 26:04.854
Before my mom died,
I was gonna go to grad school

26:05.647 --> 26:07.899
and try to become a writer.

26:08.817 --> 26:10.402
But maybe it's like you and New York.

26:10.485 --> 26:13.238
God. I hope not.

26:13.321 --> 26:15.657
No, I mean, your life is here.

26:15.740 --> 26:16.908
You have this house.

26:17.534 --> 26:19.911
People who love you. You've got Dolly.

26:19.995 --> 26:22.998
Rose, do you think I wanna be here?

26:25.083 --> 26:27.502
Cleaning up after Barbie and Ken?

26:28.461 --> 26:30.797
Don't get me wrong,
I love them, they're great.

26:31.590 --> 26:35.927
But if Broadway called tomorrow,
I would sell this fucking house.

26:37.387 --> 26:40.223
And I would never think about
any of these people ever again.

26:43.476 --> 26:44.728
Go to grad school,

26:45.604 --> 26:48.857
write a novel… about me,

26:49.357 --> 26:53.778
but do it now while I'm still cute enough
to play myself in the movie.

26:55.113 --> 26:57.616
'Cause this was never my dream.

27:22.390 --> 27:23.433
Hold on, buddy.

27:25.268 --> 27:26.269
I'm on my way.

27:31.232 --> 27:33.401
Here she is, boys.

27:34.235 --> 27:37.155
Here she is, world.

27:38.907 --> 27:42.952
Here's Rose!

27:54.089 --> 27:55.507
Play it, boys.

28:10.730 --> 28:12.482
Well, I got it.

28:15.777 --> 28:19.364
Okay, doll. Listen carefully.

28:19.948 --> 28:22.534
I'm only gonna say this once.

28:23.118 --> 28:25.704
This is not my real face.

28:36.881 --> 28:39.551
And this is not my real face either.

28:49.978 --> 28:52.689
Hal, you're gonna have
to come up here and help me.

28:52.772 --> 28:54.774
Mama's runnin' out of hands.

29:00.947 --> 29:01.990
Rose?

29:13.209 --> 29:14.252
Rose?

29:22.343 --> 29:28.725
I am having
a relationship with a sentence.

29:30.310 --> 29:31.936
It was just one of those things.

29:32.020 --> 29:34.439
It was a chance meeting

29:34.522 --> 29:37.817
that grew into something
more important for both of us.

29:37.901 --> 29:42.572
Everybody knows about me and the sentence.

29:42.655 --> 29:43.907
And now,

29:44.616 --> 29:47.911
I have the pleasure of reading it

29:47.994 --> 29:50.497
into the Library of Congress.

29:53.082 --> 29:54.125
Rose?

30:14.771 --> 30:17.273
Babe! Please open the door.

30:17.357 --> 30:19.818
Let me in the car.
Barb, it's not funny anymore.

30:20.401 --> 30:21.945
Honey! Just open the door.

30:22.028 --> 30:24.948
Barbie, open the door.
It's not funny anymore.

30:25.949 --> 30:27.909
Let me in the car! Barb!

30:28.535 --> 30:29.577
Come on!

30:30.578 --> 30:34.123
Honey, I need to get in the car.
Okay? Just let me in the car, please.

30:34.833 --> 30:37.252
Why is this happening?
I thought we were looking for Jed.

30:37.335 --> 30:38.169
We are.

30:38.253 --> 30:39.921
Then why am I in my friends' dreams?

30:40.004 --> 30:42.382
Because you are drawing
the dreams of others to you.

30:42.465 --> 30:45.009
Barbie, please! What'd I do?

30:45.093 --> 30:47.387
Just be careful
not to lose yourself in them.

30:48.179 --> 30:51.266
Take a moment. Find your own path.

31:24.173 --> 31:25.884
I can hardly believe it.

31:26.676 --> 31:28.136
Here we are at last.

31:28.678 --> 31:31.180
The Arch of the Porpentine.

31:31.264 --> 31:34.183
Our journey has indeed been long,
Miss Barbara,

31:34.267 --> 31:38.897
and many's the worthy companion
we have found and lost along the way.

31:39.480 --> 31:42.442
So many lives lost, Martin Tenbones.

31:43.026 --> 31:44.277
And because of what?

31:45.445 --> 31:49.574
A confection of spun silver
and rose quartz.

31:49.657 --> 31:54.621
The Porpentine is more than that, lady,
as you know in your soul of souls.

32:02.170 --> 32:04.881
So, what is a dream vortex?

32:05.715 --> 32:08.134
What is it for? What does it do?

32:09.260 --> 32:13.222
I confess, there are some questions
to which even I do not have an answer.

32:13.723 --> 32:15.141
But I can tell you that a vortex

32:15.224 --> 32:19.354
has the power to dream
entire worlds or destroy them.

32:33.618 --> 32:34.661
Is that…

32:34.744 --> 32:35.745
Zelda.

32:36.663 --> 32:38.289
When she was your brother's age.

32:43.795 --> 32:47.924
Mommy and Daddy told me to go away.
So, here I am in the old bone orchards.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.718
Nobody understands me.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.053
Nobody cares.

32:53.388 --> 32:55.223
Nobody understands but Chantal.

32:56.015 --> 32:59.268
Chantal comes along,
shows me she's my soul sister.

33:03.648 --> 33:06.109
Me and her are gothic heroines,

33:06.192 --> 33:09.070
secret brides to the faceless slaves
of the nameless night

33:09.153 --> 33:11.197
of the castle of dread desire.

33:14.909 --> 33:15.994
Is she lost?

33:16.077 --> 33:17.453
She's at home here.

33:18.121 --> 33:20.498
That is what most people seek
when they dream.

33:22.000 --> 33:22.834
Home?

33:23.793 --> 33:25.503
Do you know where that is for Jed?

34:18.681 --> 34:19.849
You know this place?

34:23.811 --> 34:25.730
That was our house growing up. Look.

34:27.857 --> 34:28.858
You've done it.

34:29.776 --> 34:31.486
You've found your brother's dream.

34:33.362 --> 34:34.739
Now, we find Gault.

34:38.826 --> 34:41.037
He's not a member
of my rogues gallery.

34:45.166 --> 34:48.503
He's the most powerful foe
we have ever faced.

34:50.046 --> 34:51.672
The King of Nightmares.

34:53.382 --> 34:55.468
And he has come to take me away from you.

34:57.095 --> 34:59.097
I'm not about to let that happen.

34:59.972 --> 35:01.766
Thank you, Sandman.

35:02.767 --> 35:05.269
But this battle is mine to face.

35:07.605 --> 35:08.648
And mine alone.

35:09.440 --> 35:10.775
We'll see about that.

35:11.317 --> 35:13.236
Jed, Jed, come back, please.

35:14.403 --> 35:17.240
What's our next move? How do we find him?

35:25.706 --> 35:29.168
Halt, King of Nightmares,
or I'll send you both to Dreamland.

35:29.752 --> 35:30.670
Jed?

35:32.046 --> 35:34.340
I am the Guardian of Sleepers.

35:34.423 --> 35:37.051
I am Lord of the Dream Domain.

35:37.844 --> 35:40.012
I am the Sandman.

35:41.097 --> 35:43.015
You are the Sandman?

35:43.766 --> 35:45.601
Is that what she told you?

35:47.395 --> 35:50.773
Where is she? Your master.

35:50.857 --> 35:51.941
Stay back.

35:52.024 --> 35:53.943
Jed, we're not here to hurt you.

36:00.867 --> 36:04.036
It's me you want. Not him.

36:05.913 --> 36:08.708
Oh, my God. Mom?

36:08.791 --> 36:11.043
That is not your mother, Rose.

36:14.130 --> 36:14.964
Rose?

36:18.885 --> 36:19.886
Is that you?

36:22.680 --> 36:24.557
I've been looking for you everywhere.

36:25.183 --> 36:27.643
Mom, it's Rose. She's all grown up.

36:28.895 --> 36:30.354
I'm sorry, Jed.

36:34.233 --> 36:37.028
Mom! What did you do to her?

36:37.111 --> 36:38.821
Jed! Jed, look at me.

36:39.405 --> 36:41.449
She is not our mom.

36:41.532 --> 36:45.369
Our mom is not here, but I am,
and I need you to tell me where you are.

36:45.953 --> 36:46.996
I'm right here.

36:47.079 --> 36:48.789
No, Jeddy, this is a dream.

36:48.873 --> 36:50.416
When you wake up, where will you be?

36:51.042 --> 36:53.586
Look. Did you write this?

36:53.669 --> 36:56.172
Uncle Barnaby said he's
gonna break every bone in my body.

36:56.255 --> 36:58.925
-Who's Barnaby?
-Aunt Clarice won't be able to stop him.

36:59.008 --> 37:01.093
Where are Aunt Clarice
and Uncle Barnaby?

37:01.177 --> 37:04.305
They're home. They're in Homeland.

37:04.388 --> 37:06.349
Where is that? Where is Home Land, Jed?

37:06.432 --> 37:08.434
Come, Gault. We must go.

37:15.107 --> 37:16.692
I'm sorry, Sandman.

37:19.237 --> 37:20.488
It's time to wake up, Jed.

37:20.571 --> 37:21.405
Wait, no!

37:21.489 --> 37:22.782
Goodbye, Rose Walker.

37:22.865 --> 37:25.201
Stop! Not yet. Jed, tell me where you are.

37:25.284 --> 37:26.244
Rose?

37:27.453 --> 37:28.329
Rose?

37:29.288 --> 37:30.498
Rose!

37:47.223 --> 37:48.808
You expecting someone?

37:48.891 --> 37:49.725
No.

37:58.317 --> 37:59.402
Good morning.

37:59.485 --> 38:00.528
Good morning.

38:04.031 --> 38:07.118
You're making it very difficult
for me to leave this morning.

38:07.201 --> 38:08.369
That was the plan.

38:10.079 --> 38:11.247
Just hear me out.

38:11.330 --> 38:14.333
You being here, in my dream,

38:15.376 --> 38:18.170
means something is different.
Something has shifted.

38:18.254 --> 38:20.006
So, if you can choose to be here…

38:22.091 --> 38:23.718
maybe you can choose to stay.

38:25.720 --> 38:28.389
Think about it.
We can have the life we always wanted.

38:28.931 --> 38:30.057
Have a baby.

38:32.810 --> 38:34.103
Start a family.

38:36.731 --> 38:37.606
Lyta.

38:39.275 --> 38:40.484
This is a dream.

38:44.697 --> 38:46.490
Anything is possible.

38:56.167 --> 38:57.168
Oh, my God.

38:59.670 --> 39:00.921
What is happening?

39:45.966 --> 39:48.803
Lyta, I found him. I found Jed.

39:49.553 --> 39:51.263
-What?
-I found Jed.

39:52.390 --> 39:53.641
Just a minute.

40:45.818 --> 40:49.321
Do you have any idea
what his life is like in the waking world?

40:53.159 --> 40:55.744
Humans cannot live in dreams.

40:55.828 --> 40:58.831
As long as he stayed there,
the child had no life

40:58.914 --> 41:00.958
nor the chance for one.

41:01.041 --> 41:03.961
The boy is being abused.

41:04.545 --> 41:05.546
He's suffering.

41:05.629 --> 41:07.590
You abused that suffering

41:09.049 --> 41:11.844
to build a Dreaming you could rule.

41:11.927 --> 41:14.638
I had no wish to rule.

41:16.515 --> 41:20.019
I merely wish to be a Dream
and not a Nightmare.

41:20.686 --> 41:23.689
To inspire rather than to frighten.

41:23.772 --> 41:27.151
The choice is not yours to make.

41:27.693 --> 41:30.112
We do not choose to be created.

41:30.196 --> 41:32.156
Nor do we choose how we are made.

41:32.823 --> 41:34.241
That is true.

41:36.452 --> 41:38.704
-But we can change.
-No.

41:39.371 --> 41:43.959
We are, each of us,
born with responsibilities.

41:44.919 --> 41:47.963
Even I am not free to choose
to be other than I am.

41:49.006 --> 41:50.382
Nor is anyone.

41:50.466 --> 41:51.800
If that were true,

41:53.052 --> 41:55.179
why did all the other
Dreams and Nightmares

41:55.262 --> 41:58.015
choose to leave this place
when you had gone away?

41:58.098 --> 42:02.061
Not all of us chose to leave
and nearly all have returned.

42:02.937 --> 42:05.731
Do you think they came back out of love?

42:08.567 --> 42:11.195
Or because they were afraid
of what you would do to them

42:11.278 --> 42:12.488
if they did not?

42:14.240 --> 42:16.825
Because I'm not afraid.

42:22.164 --> 42:23.207
You should be.

42:27.878 --> 42:32.216
A Nightmare's purpose is
to reveal a dreamer's fears,

42:32.299 --> 42:33.551
that they may face them.

42:36.011 --> 42:40.599
Perhaps a few thousand years
in the darkness will reveal your fears.

42:51.610 --> 42:57.283
Better that than to make others afraid.

43:00.202 --> 43:05.916
Even a Nightmare can dream, my lord.

43:16.677 --> 43:18.762
You feel her punishment was unjust?

43:26.687 --> 43:28.480
I used to be something else.

43:30.608 --> 43:32.776
Before you made me your librarian.

43:34.528 --> 43:35.863
We all change, sir.

43:37.364 --> 43:40.367
Even you, perhaps. One day.

43:43.162 --> 43:45.122
Lucienne, I realize that in my absence,

43:45.205 --> 43:47.291
you were compelled to
make decisions in my stead,

43:47.374 --> 43:51.003
and I am grateful to you.

43:52.171 --> 43:53.964
But I am back now.

43:58.135 --> 43:59.803
You may return to the library.

44:51.605 --> 44:52.815
You must be Jed.

45:03.283 --> 45:04.993
Your sister sent me.

45:06.412 --> 45:07.871
Your sister, Rose.

45:29.393 --> 45:30.477
Ma'am, you can't be here.

45:30.561 --> 45:32.479
My little brother, Jed,
he lives with them.

45:32.563 --> 45:34.940
Is he inside? Is he okay?

45:35.524 --> 45:37.234
There was no one else inside.

45:37.317 --> 45:39.111
Just the two adult victims.

45:39.194 --> 45:41.321
Wherever your brother is, he's not here.

45:53.375 --> 45:55.419
So, how do you know my sister?

45:57.087 --> 45:57.963
I don't.

46:03.343 --> 46:05.304
But I'm really looking forward
to meeting her.
