00:01.102 --> 00:04.137
Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer...

00:04.171 --> 00:04.971
RILEY:
 What are you?

00:05.004 --> 00:06.674
I'm the slayer.

00:06.705 --> 00:09.009
The implant works.
Hostile 17 can't harm

00:09.042 --> 00:10.343
any living creature in any way

00:10.378 --> 00:12.146
without
 intense neurological pain.

00:12.179 --> 00:14.013
SPIKE:
 I can hurt a demon.

00:14.048 --> 00:18.219
That's right. I'm back,
and I'm a bloody animal!

00:20.888 --> 00:22.390
Well, I thought

00:22.422 --> 00:24.057
we made a pretty good team.

00:24.091 --> 00:26.025
RILEY:
 You're really strong.

00:26.059 --> 00:28.027
I like it.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.532
I implore you, Neisa,

00:31.565 --> 00:34.234
blessed goddess of chance
and fortune,

00:34.268 --> 00:36.036
heed my call.

00:36.070 --> 00:39.039
Send to me the heart I desire.

00:39.073 --> 00:41.542
XANDER: You know, magic
at the poker table

00:41.575 --> 00:43.377
qualifies
as cheating.

00:43.411 --> 00:45.713
That wasn't magic.
I was praying.

00:45.746 --> 00:48.082
Two, please.

00:51.618 --> 00:53.020
Five.

00:53.052 --> 00:54.588
An, I keep telling you.

00:54.621 --> 00:57.057
Four's the max
and only if you have an ace.

00:57.957 --> 00:59.058
Okay, four.

00:59.093 --> 01:00.427
Let's see the ace.

01:00.460 --> 01:02.596
Three.

01:02.630 --> 01:04.697
What a stupid game.

01:04.730 --> 01:07.534
All these rules just to win
little plastic disks.

01:07.567 --> 01:10.737
Chips. They're called chips.
They represent money,

01:10.771 --> 01:13.073
since none of us has any
money to represent money.

01:13.106 --> 01:16.444
But that's gonna change once
my merchandise hits the street.

01:16.477 --> 01:19.546
Mmm. What you got in the boxes,
drugs?

01:19.579 --> 01:22.081
It's not drugs, is it, Xander?

01:22.115 --> 01:24.084
Not drugs.

01:24.117 --> 01:29.590
You are looking
at the new local distributor

01:29.623 --> 01:31.591
for Boost Bars.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.661
"The natural food bar
that provides

01:33.694 --> 01:35.662
"a nutritional energy boost
for active,

01:35.695 --> 01:40.000
health-conscious people."
Want one?
No, thanks.

01:40.033 --> 01:42.436
Those things usually taste
kind of tasteless,

01:42.469 --> 01:45.739
then leave
a bad aftertastelessness.

01:45.772 --> 01:48.075
Well, don't let the
healthy scare ya.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.810
Check out these
ingredients. See?

01:49.843 --> 01:52.246
Loaded with fatty goodness.
Come on,

01:52.280 --> 01:54.847
somebody bet already.
I've got three "K" cards.

01:56.984 --> 01:59.853
Wish that Buff
could've made it.

01:59.887 --> 02:02.956
This three-hand poker's
not quite the game.

02:02.989 --> 02:04.957
Guess she's out with Riley.
You know how it is

02:04.992 --> 02:06.659
with a spankin' new boyfriend.

02:06.694 --> 02:08.127
Yes, we've enjoyed spanking.

02:10.698 --> 02:12.699
Well...

02:12.733 --> 02:14.668
(clears throat)
the thing is,

02:14.701 --> 02:16.670
I think
Riley's...

02:16.704 --> 02:19.973
okay, in an oafish kind of way.
But...

02:20.007 --> 02:22.009
am I the only
one with a big

02:22.042 --> 02:23.544
floating question mark
over his head

02:23.576 --> 02:25.111
about this Initiative thing?

02:25.145 --> 02:27.781
Well, they do seem to fall
into the good guy camp.

02:27.814 --> 02:30.150
I mean, they are anti-demon.

02:31.151 --> 02:34.487
But probably pro-ex-demon.

02:34.521 --> 02:36.956
Maybe.
I choose to feel threatened.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.627
And why not? There's
still heaps we don't know

02:39.659 --> 02:41.027
about these commandos.

02:41.061 --> 02:43.997
What exactly are they up to?

02:44.031 --> 02:46.667
(crickets chirping)

02:54.241 --> 02:56.509
(shouts, grunts)

02:56.543 --> 02:58.846
(grunting)

03:05.752 --> 03:07.420
(zapping)

03:07.455 --> 03:08.722
WALSH:
Lights!

03:12.560 --> 03:16.530
Took the patrol team
42 minutes to track you.

03:16.563 --> 03:19.165
And you neutralized
them in 28 seconds.

03:19.199 --> 03:22.703
I was just lucky.

03:22.735 --> 03:24.372
I see.

03:24.405 --> 03:28.074
Well, still, very impressive.

03:32.445 --> 03:34.914
I was just being modest
with the whole lucky thing.

03:34.948 --> 03:37.116
You got that, right?

03:37.150 --> 03:39.287
I got it.

03:39.319 --> 03:42.555
Awesome, Buffy.

03:42.590 --> 03:45.224
See? You're a hit.

03:45.259 --> 03:46.826
Everybody loves you.

03:51.998 --> 03:55.102
(wolf howling)

03:55.134 --> 03:57.236
*

04:45.353 --> 04:47.788
*

04:49.189 --> 04:51.558
(indistinct chatter)

04:53.192 --> 04:56.163
So then Professor Walsh said
that I was just as amazing

04:56.196 --> 04:58.632
as Riley had said. And
later, he told me that

04:58.665 --> 05:01.435
she couldn't stop talking about
this move I made where I used

05:01.468 --> 05:03.870
one of the commandos as a
shield to block a Taser blast.

05:03.903 --> 05:05.473
It was, like, 12,000 volts.

05:05.505 --> 05:08.541
It took the guy
almost two hours to recover.

05:08.576 --> 05:10.143
(chuckles)
Mmm.

05:10.177 --> 05:12.144
How was your night?

05:12.178 --> 05:15.815
Like a normal person's.
Light on the action-pack.

05:15.848 --> 05:18.485
Hope tonight's not too much
of a letdown for you,

05:18.519 --> 05:19.920
excitement-wise.

05:21.422 --> 05:24.557
You do remember
about tonight, right?

05:24.591 --> 05:26.360
Bronze. The gang.

05:26.394 --> 05:27.995
Are you kidding?

05:28.028 --> 05:29.663
I wouldn't be anywhere else.

05:29.697 --> 05:31.031
I miss you guys.

05:31.064 --> 05:32.399
We haven't been able

05:32.432 --> 05:34.300
to spend that much time
together lately.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.737
You've been busy,
fighting armies and stuff.

05:37.771 --> 05:39.540
Not to mention other
distractions

05:39.572 --> 05:41.742
of a more romantic--

05:41.774 --> 05:43.175
Riley just walked in.

05:48.180 --> 05:49.316
Do you wanna

05:49.348 --> 05:50.850
let him know you're here?

05:50.884 --> 05:54.086
No. Just enjoying
a good stare.

05:54.120 --> 05:57.024
Tell me about your night.

05:57.057 --> 05:58.725
Well, spent most of it
at Xander's

05:58.759 --> 06:00.593
teaching Anya to play poker.

06:00.627 --> 06:02.228
That sounds like fun.

06:02.262 --> 06:06.165
Yeah. Except the Anya part
and the poker part.

06:06.199 --> 06:09.502
Wil, I think you better
get used... to a Twinkie?

06:09.536 --> 06:11.004
That's his lunch?

06:11.038 --> 06:12.639
Oh, he is so
gonna be punished.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.175
Everyone's getting
spanked but me.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.545
What?

06:17.577 --> 06:19.245
Nothing.

06:32.425 --> 06:36.629
Wipe your feet
when you enter a person's home.

06:36.663 --> 06:39.533
Ah, yes, careless of me.

06:39.567 --> 06:41.802
Tracking mud all over
your, um,

06:41.834 --> 06:44.071
mud.

06:44.103 --> 06:46.206
I'll admit,

06:46.238 --> 06:48.509
it's a bit of a fixer-upper.

06:49.610 --> 06:51.244
Needs a woman's touch.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.047
Care to have a crack at it?

06:54.081 --> 06:56.649
While I'd love to go on

06:56.683 --> 06:58.418
trading jabs with you, Spike,

06:58.451 --> 07:00.387
perhaps I'll come to the point.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.723
Much as it pains me
to say it,

07:02.755 --> 07:05.257
um, I owe you
a debt of gratitude

07:05.291 --> 07:08.394
for the help you provided me
in my recent... metamorphosis.

07:08.427 --> 07:10.262
Stuff the gratitude.

07:10.297 --> 07:13.399
You owe me more than that, mate.

07:13.432 --> 07:17.004
300. Count it if you... like.

07:17.036 --> 07:18.437
I'll do that.

07:27.279 --> 07:28.915
Um,

07:28.949 --> 07:31.184
thinking about
your, um, affliction

07:31.218 --> 07:34.420
and, uh, your
newfound discovery

07:34.454 --> 07:36.689
that you can fight
only demons,

07:36.723 --> 07:38.759
it occurs to me
that, um-- (chuckles)

07:38.792 --> 07:41.762
and I realize this is completely
against your nature--

07:41.795 --> 07:43.764
but has it
occurred to you

07:43.797 --> 07:45.132
there may be
a higher purpose?

07:45.165 --> 07:48.869
(groans)
You made me lose count.

07:48.901 --> 07:50.603
What are you still doing here?

07:50.637 --> 07:52.204
Talking to myself,
apparently.

07:52.238 --> 07:53.807
Well, piss off, then.

07:53.841 --> 07:55.207
This bit of business wraps up

07:55.242 --> 07:57.177
any I got with you
and your slayerettes.

07:57.209 --> 08:00.514
From here on, I want nothing
to do with the lot of you.

08:00.548 --> 08:01.714
Your choosing
to remain in Sunnydale

08:01.749 --> 08:03.483
might make
that a little difficult.

08:03.516 --> 08:06.954
You and yours will just have to
show a little restraint is all.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.689
Now get out.

08:13.593 --> 08:15.696
And I don't want you
crawling back here,

08:15.728 --> 08:17.665
knocking on my door,
pleading for help

08:17.697 --> 08:20.132
the second teen witch's
magic goes all wonky

08:20.167 --> 08:21.834
or little Xander cuts
a new tooth.

08:21.869 --> 08:23.571
We're through. Got it?

08:29.408 --> 08:31.177
Honeymoon is over.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.046
(door closes)

08:37.183 --> 08:39.385
You don't have to do this.

08:39.418 --> 08:41.120
I know.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.792
I mean,
if you'd rather wait...

08:46.025 --> 08:47.527
I'm ready.

08:47.561 --> 08:50.529
I want to.

09:01.774 --> 09:04.711
COMPUTER:
New retinal scan recorded:

09:04.745 --> 09:06.746
Summers, Buffy.

09:22.394 --> 09:24.764
(indistinct P.A. announcements)

09:30.470 --> 09:32.338
My God.

09:40.648 --> 09:43.549
You said it was big.

09:43.582 --> 09:45.418
You told me,

09:45.451 --> 09:48.488
but you never said
it was huge.

09:48.520 --> 09:49.956
Don't like to brag.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.061
I had no idea.

09:54.094 --> 09:56.296
This is incredible.

09:56.328 --> 09:59.966
But not that I thought it was
some fly-by-night operation.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.333
Unless it is.

10:01.368 --> 10:03.336
I mean, can you guys fly?
At night?

10:03.370 --> 10:05.673
With those jet-pack things?
Do you have those?

10:05.706 --> 10:07.307
Can't really talk about it.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.842
This is unreal.

10:11.845 --> 10:14.181
So, you like
our little operation?

10:14.214 --> 10:16.149
Yeah.

10:16.182 --> 10:19.687
Yes. It's very clean.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.022
Your visitor's pass.

10:22.054 --> 10:23.856
And I've assembled
some reading material

10:23.890 --> 10:25.826
to bring you up to speed.

10:25.859 --> 10:27.594
Oh.

10:27.626 --> 10:29.528
And I thought I was never gonna
get homework from you again.

10:29.562 --> 10:31.097
You can't take that home.

10:31.130 --> 10:33.600
That's classified material.
Highly sensitive.

10:33.633 --> 10:34.868
When you're through
reading those pages,

10:34.902 --> 10:36.970
you'll have to eat them.

10:38.238 --> 10:40.606
She's joking.

10:40.639 --> 10:42.375
Don't worry.
Doesn't happen very often.

10:42.408 --> 10:43.744
Shall we?

10:48.380 --> 10:50.182
Much of our hands-on research

10:50.216 --> 10:51.951
with the HSTs
is performed here.

10:51.985 --> 10:55.154
We call this "the pit."

10:55.187 --> 10:57.624
And what do you call those?

10:57.657 --> 10:59.459
RILEY: Tough.
Took eight of us

10:59.491 --> 11:00.894
to bring those two down.

11:00.927 --> 11:02.562
WALSH: They'll be under
our control soon enough.

11:02.595 --> 11:03.996
Dr. Angleman.

11:04.932 --> 11:07.299
Head of our science team.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.634
He's a leader in the field

11:08.668 --> 11:10.636
of xenomorphic
behavior modification.

11:10.669 --> 11:12.072
Behavior modification?

11:12.105 --> 11:13.874
We've made
significant advances

11:13.907 --> 11:15.708
in reconditioning
the subterrestrials,

11:15.743 --> 11:18.378
bringing them to a point where
they no longer pose a threat.

11:18.411 --> 11:19.846
So I've seen.

11:21.048 --> 11:23.149
On the Discovery Channel.

11:23.182 --> 11:25.351
With gorillas and sharks.

11:25.384 --> 11:26.720
They made them all nice.

11:26.754 --> 11:28.120
You haven't seen it?

11:31.357 --> 11:33.393
What's over there?

11:40.033 --> 11:41.835
The armory.

11:41.869 --> 11:45.938
You'll have to be cleared for
use on each of these weapons.

11:45.972 --> 11:48.341
The more advanced arsenal
can be complicated,

11:48.375 --> 11:51.778
but I'm certain, in time,
you'll pick that up.

11:51.812 --> 11:53.346
Don't pick that up.

11:53.379 --> 11:54.681
What is it?

11:54.713 --> 11:56.515
About $20,000.

11:56.548 --> 11:58.317
It's a prototype
for a com-cam.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.923
Communications camera,
soon to be standard issue.

12:02.956 --> 12:04.591
Gives us a direct comlink
to control

12:04.624 --> 12:06.058
when we're out
in the field.

12:06.092 --> 12:07.693
Also monitors the heart rate
of the wearer.

12:07.726 --> 12:10.864
A valuable tool for research in
stress and combat conditioning.

12:10.898 --> 12:12.099
If you'll follow me,

12:12.131 --> 12:13.332
I'll show you
the HST containment area.

12:20.173 --> 12:22.708
We have a few more things
to give you.

12:22.741 --> 12:24.878
What's in there?

12:24.912 --> 12:26.879
Research area.

12:26.913 --> 12:29.581
Very restricted
for security reasons.

12:29.615 --> 12:31.217
(lock buzzes)
Here is your security card

12:31.250 --> 12:33.385
and your pager.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.721
I've been thinking
about getting one of these.

12:35.754 --> 12:37.724
We're the only ones
with the number,

12:37.756 --> 12:38.826
and it stays that way.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.726
Right.

12:40.759 --> 12:42.830
Lose either one of them,
there's hell to pay,

12:42.863 --> 12:44.596
and down here,
we mean that literally.

12:44.630 --> 12:47.200
Again, welcome to the team.

12:50.437 --> 12:51.938
WILLOW:
 This is so cool.

12:53.941 --> 12:57.576
Wow. I've been trying
to find a dolls-eye crystal

12:57.610 --> 12:59.078
my entire life.

12:59.111 --> 13:01.849
Well, since June, anyway.

13:01.881 --> 13:03.649
Where'd you get it?

13:03.682 --> 13:06.619
It was my grandma's, I think.

13:06.653 --> 13:10.523
I found it a long time ago
in my attic.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.960
Uh, I want you to have it.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.628
Oh, no. Tara,

13:15.662 --> 13:18.030
that-that's really sweet.

13:18.065 --> 13:19.765
But I can't.
It's like

13:19.798 --> 13:21.634
a family heirloom.

13:21.668 --> 13:23.635
I-I just wouldn't
feel comfortable.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.707
But if you wanted to try out
some spells with it sometime,

13:28.740 --> 13:30.476
I wouldn't say no.

13:30.509 --> 13:32.879
Maybe tonight.

13:32.913 --> 13:34.713
I mean,
if you're not doing something,

13:34.746 --> 13:37.750
you could come over,
and we could do something.

13:39.686 --> 13:41.620
Tonight.

13:41.653 --> 13:44.557
That sounds really nice,
but tonight, I, uh...

13:44.591 --> 13:47.894
already have plans
with people. Other.

13:47.927 --> 13:49.528
Oh.

13:49.562 --> 13:53.365
Uh, (chuckles) um, that's okay.

13:53.399 --> 13:54.902
A-Another time.

13:54.934 --> 13:56.403
Absolutely.

13:58.105 --> 14:01.240
It's just tonight,
it's kind of a specific crowd.

14:01.274 --> 14:04.010
You might feel out of place.

14:05.211 --> 14:07.779
I'd better get to class.

14:08.715 --> 14:10.350
Well, um,

14:10.383 --> 14:11.951
I'll see you later, okay?

14:20.692 --> 14:23.062
(lock buzzes)

14:31.270 --> 14:33.405
(beeping)

14:39.412 --> 14:41.780
(water running)

14:45.784 --> 14:47.519
How did the tour go?

14:47.553 --> 14:49.456
I'm not sure.
She's unpredictable.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.024
She's an unnecessary risk.

14:51.057 --> 14:53.059
Possibly.

14:53.092 --> 14:55.062
How's our baby doing today?

14:55.095 --> 14:56.528
Adjusting nicely.

14:56.562 --> 14:59.265
Reflexes, motor functions--
all off the charts.

14:59.298 --> 15:00.899
That's what I like to hear.

15:03.503 --> 15:05.705
Almost time to wake up, Adam,

15:05.738 --> 15:08.975
and take your first look
at the world.

15:10.743 --> 15:13.113
I know you're gonna
make me proud.

15:28.427 --> 15:31.999
Xander, you haven't been paying
any attention to me tonight.

15:32.032 --> 15:34.433
Just peddling
those processed food bricks.

15:34.466 --> 15:36.003
I don't know why.

15:36.036 --> 15:39.806
Well, let me put it
in a way you'll understand.

15:39.838 --> 15:42.241
Sell bars, make money.

15:42.274 --> 15:44.177
Take Anya nice places.

15:44.211 --> 15:46.245
Buy pretty things.

15:46.278 --> 15:48.280
That does make sense.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.184
All right, I support you.
Go sell more.

15:52.219 --> 15:54.653
Uh, well, this was
the only one I had on me.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.655
Besides, it's getting late.
Maybe we should go.

15:56.688 --> 15:58.024
Go? You can't go.

15:58.057 --> 16:00.092
Buffy hasn't gotten here yet.

16:00.126 --> 16:02.861
Let's face it, Wil,
she's almost an hour late.

16:02.894 --> 16:04.264
She's probably off living
the life of Riley.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.166
I don't think she's comin'.

16:06.198 --> 16:07.366
She is.

16:07.399 --> 16:08.934
She said she was looking forward

16:08.967 --> 16:11.937
to spending quality time
with just us.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.206
See? Here she comes.

16:16.408 --> 16:17.876
With Riley...

16:17.909 --> 16:20.179
and some other guys.

16:20.212 --> 16:22.514
Hi, all.
Sorry about the late-itude.

16:22.548 --> 16:23.716
XANDER:
Late?

16:23.750 --> 16:26.719
Really? Huh, hadn't noticed.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.855
Hope you don't mind us
tagging along.

16:28.888 --> 16:30.523
No, no, of course not.

16:30.557 --> 16:33.826
The more, the... more.

16:33.860 --> 16:35.961
This is Graham.
Uh, this is Forrest.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.730
That's Kevin, and that's
Jay in the back.

16:37.764 --> 16:39.365
We're gonna go grab some drinks.

16:39.399 --> 16:41.134
Anybody wanting?
Coke, please.

16:41.168 --> 16:42.235
I'm good.

16:43.436 --> 16:44.770
No.

16:46.373 --> 16:48.475
We're going away to dance.

16:48.508 --> 16:49.908
Over there.
We are?

16:54.413 --> 16:56.249
Anya seems a bit on edge.

16:56.283 --> 16:59.719
She's a little antsy
around commando types.

16:59.751 --> 17:02.221
Ex-demon issues.

17:02.254 --> 17:04.656
Oh, you know, I didn't think
that you would mind.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.259
Uh, Riley and the guys
were throwing

17:06.291 --> 17:07.992
a little impromptu celebration
in my honor,

17:08.027 --> 17:10.497
and it made it, like,
impossible not to invite them.

17:10.529 --> 17:13.531
Oh, that's neat
about the celebrating.

17:13.566 --> 17:16.502
I just thought
this was supposed to be,

17:16.536 --> 17:18.538
you know, us.

17:18.569 --> 17:21.107
Just the Scooby Corps,
you know?

17:21.141 --> 17:23.210
I mean, I could've invited
somebody else

17:23.242 --> 17:26.078
if I knew it was
an open free-for-all.

17:26.113 --> 17:28.012
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.781
My total bad.

17:29.816 --> 17:32.551
So, who did you want
to invite?

17:32.585 --> 17:34.554
What?

17:34.586 --> 17:36.021
You said you wanted
to invite someone.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.624
No, not-- no one.

17:37.656 --> 17:40.559
I mean, I meant
a hypothetical someone,

17:40.593 --> 17:42.362
which is to say no one.

17:42.394 --> 17:44.029
What are we celebrating?

17:44.063 --> 17:46.798
I'm in. The Initiative.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.535
Professor Walsh gave me
the grand tour,

17:48.567 --> 17:50.202
and we're talking
Grand as in Canyon.

17:50.237 --> 17:52.138
You'd never believe
the size of it.

17:52.172 --> 17:54.273
That's really...

17:54.307 --> 17:56.143
again, I say neat.

17:56.175 --> 17:58.778
So, what do you mean exactly?

17:58.810 --> 18:01.047
You've joined them?

18:01.079 --> 18:03.115
No, not exactly.

18:03.150 --> 18:05.585
It just means
that when I patrol,

18:05.617 --> 18:07.487
I'll have a heavily armed
team backing me up.

18:07.519 --> 18:09.788
Plus, boyfriend
going to work with me--

18:09.821 --> 18:11.590
big extra perk.

18:13.192 --> 18:16.663
Buffy, do you really think
this is a good idea?

18:16.695 --> 18:18.298
I mean,

18:18.330 --> 18:20.532
don't you think
you're rushing things a little?

18:21.768 --> 18:23.635
I thought you liked Riley.

18:23.670 --> 18:26.506
Not with Riley.
With the Initiative.

18:26.538 --> 18:30.143
I mean, there's a bunch of stuff
about them we still don't know.

18:30.176 --> 18:31.810
I know that.

18:31.844 --> 18:33.313
Like what?

18:33.346 --> 18:36.415
Well, what's their
ultimate agenda?

18:36.449 --> 18:39.786
I mean, okay, yeah,
they neuter vampires and demons.

18:39.818 --> 18:42.855
But then what? Are they gonna
reintegrate them into society?

18:42.888 --> 18:45.657
Get them jobs as bag boys
at Wal-Mart?

18:47.294 --> 18:50.096
Does Wal-Mart have bag boys?

18:50.128 --> 18:51.798
Plus, don't forget
that 314 thing

18:51.830 --> 18:54.467
that Ethan told Giles about.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.368
Well, a man that worships Chaos
and tries to kill you

18:56.403 --> 18:57.769
is a man you can trust.

18:57.804 --> 19:00.105
Well, bad info or not,

19:00.138 --> 19:02.474
I just think there's certain
questions you should ask

19:02.509 --> 19:04.676
before you go off and enlist.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.578
(pagers beeping)

19:09.382 --> 19:10.950
That's us. Let's go.

19:10.982 --> 19:13.118
When did you get a pager?
What's going...

19:13.152 --> 19:15.121
RILEY:
That's our cue.

19:15.153 --> 19:16.021
Mother wants us.

19:16.055 --> 19:17.824
Wil...

19:17.856 --> 19:19.526
I know. Talk later.

19:21.193 --> 19:24.297
BUFFY: So what's
 the big emergency?

19:24.330 --> 19:25.531
This is your objective.

19:25.565 --> 19:27.666
Sub-T-67119.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.068
Demon class, Polgara species.

19:30.102 --> 19:32.471
Though visual confirmation
has not yet been made,

19:32.505 --> 19:34.740
we're confident of the target's
approximate position

19:34.773 --> 19:37.676
as it leaves behind
a distinct protein marker.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.246
Dr. Angleman

19:39.278 --> 19:40.913
will brief you
on its defenses.

19:40.947 --> 19:42.815
When threatened...

19:42.848 --> 19:44.317
bone skewers jut

19:44.351 --> 19:46.685
from the creature's forearms
during battle.

19:46.719 --> 19:49.221
It's imperative
when ensnaring it

19:49.256 --> 19:51.657
not to damage its arms.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.092
That's all you
really need to know.

19:53.125 --> 19:55.561
Question.

19:56.563 --> 19:58.265
Buffy?

19:58.298 --> 20:00.833
Why exactly can't we damage

20:00.866 --> 20:02.434
this polka thing's arms?

20:02.469 --> 20:05.171
I mean, not that I want to.
It's just,

20:05.203 --> 20:07.105
in my experience,
when fighting for your life,

20:07.138 --> 20:10.410
body parts get damaged,
and better its bits than mine.

20:10.442 --> 20:13.011
Or ours.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.747
We wish to study
the physiology

20:14.780 --> 20:16.282
of every subterrestrial's

20:16.316 --> 20:17.683
natural defenses.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.519
Part of the research we do here.

20:19.551 --> 20:21.753
Yes?

20:21.788 --> 20:23.589
What do they want?

20:23.623 --> 20:25.258
Want?

20:25.291 --> 20:26.593
Why are they here?

20:26.625 --> 20:28.627
Sacrifices, treasure,

20:28.661 --> 20:30.596
or are they
just gettin' rampagey?

20:30.630 --> 20:32.064
I find it's easier to predict

20:32.097 --> 20:33.231
their responses if I know...

20:33.266 --> 20:34.601
Uh, they're not sentient,

20:34.634 --> 20:36.802
just destructive, I believe.

20:36.836 --> 20:38.069
They do have keen
eyesight, however.

20:38.104 --> 20:40.839
You might want to
be suited up for this.

20:42.474 --> 20:44.042
Oh, you mean the camo and stuff?

20:44.076 --> 20:45.912
I thought about it, but on me,

20:45.944 --> 20:47.480
it's gonna look
all Private Benjamin.

20:47.513 --> 20:49.316
(laughter)
Don't worry.

20:49.348 --> 20:51.250
I've patrolled
in this halter many times.

20:52.250 --> 20:53.819
Why don't we give our attention

20:53.853 --> 20:54.886
to Dr. Angleman
and save all questions

20:54.921 --> 20:56.288
until the end?

20:56.323 --> 20:57.423
Actually, I'm finished.

20:57.457 --> 20:58.825
Oh.

20:58.857 --> 21:01.294
Uh, well, Agent Finn,
deploy the teams.

21:01.327 --> 21:03.730
Okay, listen up.

21:03.762 --> 21:06.231
We'll be going
in a four-squad setup.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.401
Team leaders: Gates,
Taggart and Stavros.

21:08.434 --> 21:09.669
Alpha team, you're with me.

21:09.701 --> 21:11.971
WALSH: Report to TLs for
assignments

21:12.003 --> 21:13.405
and weapon requisitions.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.741
Reminder: this is
a zap and trap, people.

21:15.775 --> 21:19.412
Capture, not a kill.
Any questions?

21:19.445 --> 21:21.513
Buffy.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.116
Willow.

21:25.151 --> 21:27.686
Funny thing happened with
my prior social engagement.

21:27.720 --> 21:30.323
Pretty much ended

21:30.356 --> 21:33.826
when a friend of mine went off
to do something with...

21:33.859 --> 21:36.295
another crowd
she hangs out with.

21:36.328 --> 21:39.832
Irony's kind of ironic
that way.

21:39.865 --> 21:42.335
Anyway, I know it's late,

21:42.368 --> 21:44.871
but I thought maybe...

21:44.903 --> 21:47.640
I mean, if you
still wanted to...

21:47.673 --> 21:49.174
do something.

21:59.385 --> 22:01.220
So I guess she hates me now.

22:01.252 --> 22:02.689
What?

22:02.721 --> 22:05.156
Professor Walsh. Questions.

22:05.191 --> 22:07.693
An Initiative
faux pas, yes?

22:07.727 --> 22:09.961
It's... a little unusual.

22:09.996 --> 22:12.230
She's just not used to it.

22:12.263 --> 22:13.732
Maybe 'cause you barely
ever opened your mouth

22:13.766 --> 22:15.067
in her classroom.

22:15.101 --> 22:16.469
But I know she likes you.

22:16.502 --> 22:18.404
In fact, she liked
you before I did.

22:18.438 --> 22:20.205
Really?

22:20.239 --> 22:22.474
Told me so herself.

22:22.509 --> 22:25.912
Well, maybe I should get her
a present or something.

22:25.944 --> 22:27.579
Buffy, can we talk
about this later?

22:27.614 --> 22:29.248
There's a dangerous
hostile out here.

22:29.280 --> 22:31.384
And since I don't
have your reflexes,

22:31.417 --> 22:33.051
I kind of need to focus.

22:33.085 --> 22:36.556
Right. Right.

22:39.791 --> 22:41.894
What do you mean
she liked me before you did?

22:41.927 --> 22:43.229
Uh...
You didn't like me?

22:46.532 --> 22:48.535
GATES:
It just isn't right.

22:49.868 --> 22:51.269
He made you team leader,
didn't he?

22:51.302 --> 22:52.704
That's not the point.

22:52.739 --> 22:54.673
I've always been Riley's
second in command.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.375
Instead, he picks a girl.

22:56.409 --> 22:57.743
His girl.
Whatever.

22:57.777 --> 23:01.079
Three guesses on what
that boy's thinking with.

23:01.113 --> 23:03.082
Maybe he just wanted
to give you a chance

23:03.115 --> 23:05.116
to get out from under
his shadow.

23:05.151 --> 23:07.787
Hey, I'm not under
anybody's shadow.

23:07.819 --> 23:09.221
It was a joke, man.

23:09.255 --> 23:10.856
Don't get your panties
in a bunch.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.558
I'm just saying...

23:12.592 --> 23:14.026
Hang on. Got something.

23:14.059 --> 23:14.961
Target?

23:14.993 --> 23:16.061
Negative.

23:17.328 --> 23:19.131
Hello,
Hostile 17.

23:19.164 --> 23:22.167
You two. Standard flanking. Go.

23:39.486 --> 23:40.987
(groans)

23:41.019 --> 23:43.422
(snarling)

23:43.455 --> 23:45.592
Alert control and alpha team.

23:45.625 --> 23:47.460
We've tagged Hostile 17
with a tracer,

23:47.493 --> 23:48.728
and we're in pursuit.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.362
(phone rings)

23:53.833 --> 23:54.834
Sir,

23:54.866 --> 23:57.836
Graham's on the talkie for you.

23:57.869 --> 24:00.239
Reception's not too good.

24:00.271 --> 24:02.008
This is alpha team. Go ahead.

24:02.040 --> 24:03.275
GRAHAM (static crackling):
Yeah, we have a sighting...

24:03.308 --> 24:06.244
Hostile 17 is tagged...
are in...

24:06.278 --> 24:08.079
Say again, beta team.
You're breaking up.

24:08.114 --> 24:09.347
(snarling)
Riley!

24:09.381 --> 24:11.182
(grunting)

24:14.153 --> 24:16.489
*

24:42.882 --> 24:46.251
*

25:10.276 --> 25:12.878
*

25:24.590 --> 25:27.026
*

25:40.807 --> 25:42.942
(grunting)

25:48.413 --> 25:52.050
So... what do you
want to do now?

26:13.505 --> 26:15.842
*

26:25.584 --> 26:29.454
I don't know how many more ways
I can say I'm not interested.

26:29.488 --> 26:30.623
XANDER:
Well, try one.

26:30.656 --> 26:32.391
Check these flavors:

26:32.423 --> 26:35.827
cherry berry, maple walnut,
ooh, almond licorice.

26:35.862 --> 26:37.163
Ew.

26:37.195 --> 26:39.097
Anya, we don't
say "ew"

26:39.131 --> 26:40.598
in front of
potential customers.

26:40.633 --> 26:42.233
Just skip this part

26:42.268 --> 26:43.736
and tell him you want money
to buy me pretty things.

26:43.769 --> 26:45.436
He'll understand.

26:45.471 --> 26:47.439
Very well.

26:47.472 --> 26:48.641
Um, maple walnut.

26:48.674 --> 26:51.477
An excellent choice.

27:02.488 --> 27:04.256
Please leave my home now.

27:04.289 --> 27:06.759
It's the, uh,
gritty texture, isn't it?

27:06.792 --> 27:09.528
Maybe you're more
of a cherry berry fellow.

27:09.560 --> 27:11.396
(pounding on door)

27:16.001 --> 27:17.635
(sizzling)
Close the door!

27:17.670 --> 27:19.305
Spike?

27:19.337 --> 27:20.605
You may want to give up

27:20.638 --> 27:22.674
these morning jogs.

27:22.709 --> 27:23.976
Soldier boys are out in force.

27:24.009 --> 27:25.443
I been trying to
keep 'em off my scent,

27:25.477 --> 27:27.313
run 'em in circles,
but they keep coming.

27:29.315 --> 27:31.217
And...

27:31.250 --> 27:32.617
how is this our concern?

27:32.651 --> 27:33.986
Seeing that you've
expressed a desire

27:34.019 --> 27:35.453
to have nothing more
to do with us.

27:35.487 --> 27:36.823
XANDER:
Spike said that?

27:36.855 --> 27:37.824
Mm-hmm.

27:37.856 --> 27:40.026
That hurts.

27:40.058 --> 27:42.828
All right. What do you
want me to say? I need help.

27:42.862 --> 27:45.497
And no cheek from you.

27:45.530 --> 27:48.067
Look, the buggers shot me...

27:48.099 --> 27:50.702
in the back.

27:50.737 --> 27:52.203
Remind me.

27:52.238 --> 27:54.205
Why should I help you?

27:54.240 --> 27:55.641
(sighs) Because you do that.

27:55.673 --> 27:58.009
You're the goody good guys.

27:58.044 --> 28:01.247
You're the bloody
frickin' calvary.

28:01.279 --> 28:03.148
You can come up with
a better answer than that.

28:03.182 --> 28:05.751
Why should I help you?

28:05.785 --> 28:09.821
Oh, because I helped you.

28:09.855 --> 28:11.190
When you turned
into that Fyarl demon,

28:11.222 --> 28:12.657
I helped you, didn't I?

28:12.691 --> 28:14.894
And that was out
of the evilness of your heart?

28:14.926 --> 28:16.627
Oh, hell no.
I made you pay me.

28:20.967 --> 28:22.902
You right bastard.

28:27.638 --> 28:28.941
That's all that's left.

28:28.974 --> 28:30.342
Spent the rest

28:30.375 --> 28:31.542
on blood and smokes,

28:31.576 --> 28:33.880
which I'll never see again.

28:33.913 --> 28:35.047
Aw, come on.

28:35.080 --> 28:37.182
Circle the wagons.

28:37.215 --> 28:38.951
Tend to the wounded here.

28:38.984 --> 28:40.719
No time for layabouts.

28:48.294 --> 28:49.761
Hey.

28:49.796 --> 28:52.730
What's the matter?

28:52.765 --> 28:54.566
Weren't expecting to see me?

28:55.835 --> 28:58.636
I never know what to expect.

29:03.776 --> 29:05.076
(pager chirping)

29:08.114 --> 29:09.548
(chuckles)

29:09.580 --> 29:12.718
Your robot bird sounds hungry.

29:12.750 --> 29:15.586
It's just a reminder
to take my vitamins.

29:15.621 --> 29:17.588
You're kidding.

29:26.999 --> 29:28.934
I'm sorry.

29:28.968 --> 29:31.470
You're quite
the regimental soldier.

29:31.502 --> 29:33.905
I am how they trained me.

29:33.940 --> 29:35.773
They?

29:35.807 --> 29:37.242
Who they?

29:37.276 --> 29:38.911
You know, the government.

29:38.944 --> 29:41.247
Plucked me out of
special-op training for this.

29:41.279 --> 29:44.983
What did they tell you
it was for?

29:45.017 --> 29:46.518
Didn't.

29:46.551 --> 29:48.253
In the military,
you learn to follow orders,

29:48.287 --> 29:49.788
not ask questions.

29:49.822 --> 29:52.090
I don't understand.

29:52.124 --> 29:55.493
Aren't you curious
about all the science

29:55.527 --> 29:56.962
and research stuff
they're doing?

29:56.996 --> 29:59.999
I know all I need to know.

30:00.031 --> 30:02.634
We're doing good here.
Protecting the public.

30:02.667 --> 30:04.502
Removing the
subterrestrial threat.

30:04.536 --> 30:07.338
It's work worth doing.

30:12.010 --> 30:13.744
What's 314?

30:16.015 --> 30:17.215
(phone rings)

30:20.719 --> 30:22.188
Riley.

30:22.221 --> 30:24.155
WALSH: We have a situation.
You're needed.

30:24.190 --> 30:25.857
On my way.

30:25.892 --> 30:26.858
What is it?

30:26.893 --> 30:28.894
Don't know.

30:31.696 --> 30:34.766
You're really not one
for asking questions, are you?

30:36.001 --> 30:37.603
I'll leave that to you.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.809
WOMAN (over P.A.): Agent Wedburn
to genetic bay three.

30:44.843 --> 30:47.378
Agent Wedburn,
genetic bay three.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.190
WALSH:
Lose your way, Agent?

30:59.892 --> 31:01.027
No, ma'am.

31:01.059 --> 31:02.327
I've instructed beta team

31:02.361 --> 31:04.363
to suspend pursuit
of Hostile 17

31:04.395 --> 31:05.864
until your arrival.

31:05.897 --> 31:07.398
I didn't want any slipups.

31:07.432 --> 31:08.901
That's why I'm putting you
in charge.

31:08.934 --> 31:11.869
You're to rendezvous with them
at these coordinates.

31:13.704 --> 31:15.240
Riley...

31:17.209 --> 31:19.211
Make me proud.

31:19.244 --> 31:20.878
Yes, ma'am.

31:22.914 --> 31:25.717
AGENT: Level three,
code six!

31:25.750 --> 31:26.919
(tools whirring)

31:29.755 --> 31:32.391
WALSH: I think we've got
a situation.

31:32.423 --> 31:34.593
The slayer?

31:34.625 --> 31:36.728
She's becoming a liability.

31:36.761 --> 31:37.963
We knew that was a danger.

31:37.997 --> 31:39.464
Does she know about
the project?

31:39.498 --> 31:41.200
She knows it exists.

31:41.232 --> 31:43.801
She already holds
too much influence over Riley--

31:43.835 --> 31:45.636
over Agent Finn.

31:45.671 --> 31:49.040
We move to
the contingency scenario?

31:49.075 --> 31:50.076
Right away.

31:50.108 --> 31:52.243
It's too bad.

31:52.278 --> 31:54.613
She could've been
a powerful ally.

31:54.645 --> 31:56.281
I know.

31:56.315 --> 31:57.548
And Finn will take it hard.

31:57.583 --> 31:59.317
That's why sooner is better.

32:08.259 --> 32:09.928
It's better.

32:12.298 --> 32:14.165
Ow! Watch it.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.433
That hurts.

32:15.467 --> 32:17.736
Doesn't appear to be a bullet.

32:17.769 --> 32:20.739
It's too deeply imbedded
for a tranquilizer dart.

32:20.771 --> 32:23.442
Also not tranquil.

32:23.474 --> 32:27.212
Some sort of illumination
emanating from it.

32:28.480 --> 32:29.315
It's blinking.

32:29.347 --> 32:30.582
I don't care if

32:30.615 --> 32:31.782
it's playing
"Rockin' the Casbah"

32:31.817 --> 32:33.451
on the bloody Jew's Harp.

32:33.484 --> 32:34.819
Just get it out of me.

32:34.853 --> 32:36.488
All right, Anya,
there's a bottle of cognac

32:36.521 --> 32:37.522
in the cabinet next to the sink.

32:37.556 --> 32:38.923
Will you get it for me?

32:38.957 --> 32:40.459
What, you gonna get
snockered now?

32:40.491 --> 32:42.028
It's not for me, you prat.

32:42.060 --> 32:43.996
If I'm gonna operate on you,
I need you anesthetized.

32:44.029 --> 32:45.330
This'll take some time.

32:45.364 --> 32:46.531
We don't have any.

32:46.565 --> 32:47.965
That blinking thing--

32:48.000 --> 32:50.469
my pseudo-soldier
memory bank

32:50.501 --> 32:51.802
tells me that's a tracer.

32:51.836 --> 32:53.172
A what?
A what?

32:53.204 --> 32:54.506
It's like a homing beacon.

32:54.539 --> 32:56.442
And if commando guys
are reading the signal,

32:56.474 --> 32:58.376
they're coming home.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.212
GILES: Well, we need
to buy some time.

33:01.247 --> 33:03.815
It's in deep,
and I'm no surgeon.

33:18.263 --> 33:19.664
Oh, hi.

33:19.698 --> 33:21.732
Hey.

33:21.767 --> 33:24.001
Out all night, huh?

33:24.036 --> 33:26.538
You, too.

33:26.571 --> 33:28.507
Yeah.

33:33.345 --> 33:34.645
Sorry about bailing
on you guys

33:34.680 --> 33:36.082
at The Bronze.

33:36.115 --> 33:37.583
That's okay. I...

33:37.615 --> 33:40.719
Don't worry about it.

33:40.751 --> 33:41.920
Okay.

33:41.952 --> 33:43.122
(pager beeping)

33:44.722 --> 33:47.058
Wow, they really
keep you hopping, don't they?

33:47.093 --> 33:48.993
Yeah. I got to go.

33:49.027 --> 33:50.628
I'll see ya?

33:52.763 --> 33:54.031
(door closes)

33:54.066 --> 33:56.468
(phone ringing)

34:00.271 --> 34:01.573
Hello?

34:01.606 --> 34:03.075
Willow, you're there at last.

34:03.108 --> 34:04.410
We have a problem.

34:04.442 --> 34:05.876
Where's Buffy?

34:05.911 --> 34:07.011
Just left.

34:07.045 --> 34:08.380
Beeped away by her new buds.

34:08.414 --> 34:11.217
You want me to go after her?

34:11.250 --> 34:13.585
Uh, no, no.
It's your help I need, actually.

34:13.619 --> 34:15.853
Really? What do you
want me to do?

34:15.887 --> 34:18.422
It's a small job.
Reconnaissance.

34:18.456 --> 34:20.458
Probably a waste
of a slayer's abilities,

34:20.492 --> 34:22.393
but my boys are
on assignment, so I...

34:22.427 --> 34:25.431
No, it's okay.
I'm up for some action.

34:25.463 --> 34:27.431
I doubt you'll
get any on this one.

34:27.465 --> 34:29.701
We have a reading
of a class three subterrestrial

34:29.735 --> 34:31.536
moving through the sewer tunnels

34:31.570 --> 34:33.572
just on
the north edge of town.

34:33.605 --> 34:35.206
Class three?

34:35.239 --> 34:36.442
It's a low-level threat.

34:36.474 --> 34:38.043
Minimal aggression.
Meager defenses.

34:38.076 --> 34:39.311
Professor Walsh.

34:39.344 --> 34:40.777
They barely show up
on the scanner

34:40.811 --> 34:43.449
and occasionally
turn out to be raccoons.

34:43.481 --> 34:45.117
Wow.

34:45.150 --> 34:47.052
You're not crazy
about raccoons, huh?

34:47.085 --> 34:50.155
We always take precautions.

34:50.188 --> 34:53.458
All we need you to do
is get a visual on this thing.

34:53.492 --> 34:56.061
This will feed me back an image,
and I can advise you from there.

34:56.094 --> 34:59.498
I don't want to put you
in any unnecessary danger.

34:59.530 --> 35:02.233
Oh, that's okay.
Danger's my birthright.

35:02.268 --> 35:03.469
Sorry.

35:03.501 --> 35:05.170
Um, Professor Walsh,

35:05.204 --> 35:07.838
there's, um,

35:07.873 --> 35:09.340
there's still some stuff

35:09.375 --> 35:11.809
about all this
that I'm not clear on.

35:11.842 --> 35:14.780
Well, when you get back,
we can have a talk.

35:14.813 --> 35:17.449
Good, okay.

35:17.483 --> 35:19.050
When I get back.

35:20.485 --> 35:23.021
Am I supposed to salute you?

35:23.054 --> 35:24.655
No.

35:24.690 --> 35:26.023
Okay.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.134
(Spike muttering)

35:38.403 --> 35:40.938
WILLOW:
 Tropo, strato, meso...

35:40.972 --> 35:43.641
aero, iono,

35:43.675 --> 35:45.110
exo.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.512
Li elemente...

35:46.545 --> 35:48.112
So how's this
supposed to work again?

35:48.146 --> 35:49.715
If she succeeds,

35:49.748 --> 35:51.483
her spell will ionize
the atmosphere around us,

35:51.516 --> 35:53.619
thereby disrupting
the tracer's signal.

35:53.652 --> 35:55.487
Buys us time.

35:55.521 --> 35:57.456
WILLOW:
"Elements are brought to bear.

35:57.489 --> 35:59.858
"Wind, earth, and water

35:59.891 --> 36:01.460
"churned amidst the fire.

36:01.492 --> 36:03.429
Let the air be burned."

36:06.565 --> 36:09.335
WILLOW: Did it work?
Is the atmosphere ionized?

36:11.869 --> 36:13.472
I'd venture yes.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.641
RILEY:
 What do you mean

36:15.673 --> 36:16.875
the signal's whacked?

36:16.907 --> 36:18.510
I mean the blip's a blob.

36:18.543 --> 36:20.311
Some kind of interference
messing with the tracer.

36:20.346 --> 36:21.880
Try to lock it down.

36:21.913 --> 36:23.581
We heading in the right
general direction?

36:23.614 --> 36:26.818
I think so. It's gonna put us
in populated areas.

36:26.851 --> 36:29.820
Okay, then. We change
into civvies, then move out.

36:29.855 --> 36:31.389
Maybe something'll turn up.

36:55.246 --> 36:56.981
(low snarling)

36:58.983 --> 37:01.119
Professor Walsh,
are you getting this?

37:01.152 --> 37:02.753
Possible HST?

37:02.788 --> 37:04.088
Make it a definite.

37:04.121 --> 37:08.025
And he's brought along
a friend.

37:08.059 --> 37:09.226
They seem--

37:13.465 --> 37:15.333
(snarling continues)

37:29.681 --> 37:31.583
(snarling)

37:33.284 --> 37:34.619
(grunting)

37:46.297 --> 37:48.699
(heart monitor beeping)

37:51.369 --> 37:53.838
(grunting continues)

38:06.818 --> 38:09.521
(beeping flatlines)

38:12.490 --> 38:14.860
(indistinct P.A. announcements)

38:25.202 --> 38:27.271
Talk to me, Forrest.

38:27.304 --> 38:29.608
Signal's somewhere
in this neighborhood.

38:29.641 --> 38:32.811
Estimate within
a two-block radius.

38:32.844 --> 38:35.280
Feels and looks like the
ionizing spell's wearing off.

38:35.313 --> 38:36.382
Giles?

38:36.414 --> 38:38.483
I-I've got it. I've got it.

38:38.516 --> 38:40.518
(grunts)

38:43.221 --> 38:44.789
Okay, we want to keep
this hostile contained.

38:44.822 --> 38:46.023
So no one's to make
a move without--

38:46.056 --> 38:48.693
Wait. Signal's cleared up.

38:48.726 --> 38:49.960
There.

38:49.994 --> 38:51.630
Let's go.

38:51.663 --> 38:53.664
Um, go.

38:56.101 --> 38:57.802
What?

38:57.835 --> 38:59.304
It's on the move.
Heading?

38:59.336 --> 39:01.072
Straight at us,
40 meters and closing.

39:01.106 --> 39:03.375
Moving fast.
In broad daylight?

39:03.409 --> 39:05.010
Look alive, people.
Weapons at the ready.

39:05.043 --> 39:07.579
25 meters, 20, 15.

39:07.612 --> 39:10.081
Where?
To the left.
Ten meters, five.

39:10.114 --> 39:12.016
Anyone?
I got nothing.

39:12.050 --> 39:12.918
This doesn't make sense.

39:12.951 --> 39:15.621
It went right past us.

39:18.356 --> 39:19.824
RILEY:
Flushed.

39:19.858 --> 39:21.358
The tracer's been flushed.

39:23.628 --> 39:25.362
(snarling, grunting)

39:46.083 --> 39:48.119
(snarling continues)

39:54.726 --> 39:56.628
(screaming)

40:08.907 --> 40:10.876
Regret to report Hostile 17
still at large.

40:10.909 --> 40:12.443
I've left beta team
to comb the area.

40:12.478 --> 40:14.244
Riley, something's happened.

40:14.278 --> 40:16.882
I-I don't know what to say.

40:16.914 --> 40:19.150
It-It's about Buffy.

40:19.184 --> 40:21.119
Buffy?

40:21.152 --> 40:24.623
Two of our hostiles broke free
and escaped into the tunnels.

40:24.655 --> 40:27.425
She went after them
on her own.

40:27.458 --> 40:29.927
She's dead, Riley.

40:31.128 --> 40:32.396
What?

40:32.429 --> 40:34.398
I did everything I could
to stop her.

40:34.431 --> 40:36.233
I told her to wait
for a backup team.

40:36.266 --> 40:38.268
She kept insisting
she didn't need any team,

40:38.302 --> 40:40.271
she could handle it
by herself.

40:40.304 --> 40:41.438
I-I'm so, so sorry.

40:41.472 --> 40:42.773
I don't understand.

40:42.807 --> 40:44.976
I know what she meant to you.

40:45.010 --> 40:46.277
How could this happen?

40:46.311 --> 40:47.746
She was a very,
very special girl.

40:47.778 --> 40:51.016
I didn't understand at first,

40:51.048 --> 40:52.851
(sighs) but she had something.

40:52.884 --> 40:54.085
I don't know, maybe,

40:54.119 --> 40:56.487
maybe I could've...
stopped her.

40:56.521 --> 40:59.190
It's hard not
to blame myself.

40:59.224 --> 41:00.925
Professor Walsh?

41:00.958 --> 41:03.961
That simple little recon
you sent me on...

41:03.994 --> 41:06.097
wasn't a raccoon.

41:06.130 --> 41:08.266
Turns out it was me
trapped in the sewers

41:08.298 --> 41:11.168
with a faulty weapon
and two of your pet demons.

41:11.202 --> 41:14.806
If you think
that's enough to kill me,

41:14.840 --> 41:17.576
you really don't know
what a slayer is.

41:19.844 --> 41:22.748
Trust me when I say
you're gonna find out.

41:40.264 --> 41:42.500
Riley...

41:43.735 --> 41:46.737
Agent Finn, I order you to stop!

41:46.771 --> 41:48.505
Agent Finn!

41:50.507 --> 41:51.677
Riley!

41:53.077 --> 41:54.980
It'll be dark soon.

41:55.012 --> 41:57.548
I think it would be wise
for you to leave Sunnydale.

41:57.583 --> 41:59.184
I'm not going anywhere,

41:59.217 --> 42:02.353
not until those bastards
undo whatever they did to me.

42:02.387 --> 42:04.590
Put me back the way I was.

42:04.623 --> 42:06.992
Sure, just explain
to the nice scientist guys

42:07.025 --> 42:10.327
that you really miss killing
and torturing innocent people.

42:10.360 --> 42:11.929
You think that would work?

42:11.963 --> 42:14.032
Spike, Lord knows why
I'm telling you this.

42:14.065 --> 42:16.034
It's for your own good.

42:16.067 --> 42:17.735
As long as the Initiative
is in operation,

42:17.768 --> 42:19.871
it's not safe for you here.

42:19.905 --> 42:21.306
No.

42:24.474 --> 42:27.144
It's not safe for any of us.

42:36.454 --> 42:39.289
So...

42:39.324 --> 42:41.025
All right.

42:41.059 --> 42:42.960
Fine.

42:42.994 --> 42:46.130
If she wants a fight,
we'll give her one,

42:46.164 --> 42:47.833
won't we, Adam?

42:49.067 --> 42:50.601
I've worked too long...

42:50.635 --> 42:53.639
too long...

42:53.672 --> 42:57.442
to let some little bitch
threaten this project,

42:57.474 --> 42:59.277
threaten me.

43:01.411 --> 43:03.914
She has no idea

43:03.949 --> 43:05.483
who she's dealing with.

43:07.318 --> 43:10.054
Once she's gone,
Riley will come around.

43:10.088 --> 43:12.456
He'll understand.

43:12.489 --> 43:15.393
It was for the greater good.

43:15.425 --> 43:17.494
He'll see that.

43:19.197 --> 43:20.931
And if he doesn't...

43:23.367 --> 43:26.003
well, first things first.

43:26.036 --> 43:30.240
Remove the complication.

43:30.275 --> 43:32.010
And when she least
expects it...

43:32.043 --> 43:34.278
(screams)

43:39.985 --> 43:41.351
Adam?

43:45.956 --> 43:47.492
Mommy.

44:25.663 --> 44:28.032
Grr. Argh.
