00:11.120 --> 00:13.122
( Silent )

00:45.680 --> 00:48.286
(grunting )

02:02.280 --> 02:03.805
( groans )

02:37.560 --> 02:39.767
( grunts, sighs )

02:50.120 --> 02:52.122
Hey, heads up!

02:53.960 --> 02:56.486
Shit.
I said heads up.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.448
Enid?

03:09.640 --> 03:12.166
( Clatters )

03:22.320 --> 03:23.845
Enid.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.321
What are you
doing out here?

03:28.480 --> 03:31.165
Enid: There's another water
bottle in the corner.

03:31.320 --> 03:33.004
Take it and go.

04:10.080 --> 04:12.048
You're not gonna
answer me?

04:13.880 --> 04:15.609
Enid:
No.

04:18.399 --> 04:20.687
What happened
in Alexandria?

04:24.040 --> 04:26.441
We heard that sound.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.568
The gunfire.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.363
Enid.

04:36.120 --> 04:39.408
Enid: What happened
is what always happens.

04:39.560 --> 04:41.562
People died.

04:41.720 --> 04:44.121
The herd broke
through the walls?

04:44.280 --> 04:45.406
Enid:
What herd?

04:45.560 --> 04:47.369
The walkers.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.090
They broke out
of the quarry early.

04:49.240 --> 04:51.402
We got on them,
but that sound, the air horn,

04:51.600 --> 04:53.284
what was that?

04:53.440 --> 04:56.091
Enid:
It was people.

04:56.240 --> 04:58.083
You should go.

04:58.240 --> 05:00.322
( Boards creaking )

05:03.760 --> 05:05.922
My wife,

05:06.080 --> 05:08.447
Maggie.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.648
She okay?

05:13.920 --> 05:16.241
Enid?

05:17.560 --> 05:19.085
Is Maggie okay?

05:19.240 --> 05:21.242
( Boards creaking )

05:22.600 --> 05:24.443
Answer me!

05:27.800 --> 05:29.962
Enid.

05:30.960 --> 05:31.961
Enid!

05:34.440 --> 05:36.488
Enid.

05:49.600 --> 05:52.001
Hey, Enid!

06:09.360 --> 06:11.169
Enid!

06:13.360 --> 06:15.681
( Panting )

06:21.000 --> 06:23.970
( theme music playing )

06:59.240 --> 07:01.720
(walkers snarling,
pounding )

07:20.680 --> 07:22.842
Morgan.

07:25.720 --> 07:28.087
Morning.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.208
We haven't talked.
We should.

07:30.360 --> 07:32.249
A little later, okay?

07:32.400 --> 07:34.528
Okay.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.804
You don't have to be
up here so much.

08:23.960 --> 08:25.644
I won't be.

08:25.800 --> 08:28.929
This is the direction
he'd come in.

08:30.960 --> 08:33.804
If he sends up a signal,
it'll be from out there.

08:33.960 --> 08:36.167
Yeah.

08:36.320 --> 08:38.163
Or it-- it won't be.

08:41.640 --> 08:44.120
When we go out there,

08:44.280 --> 08:46.681
it's never easy,
it's never simple.

08:46.840 --> 08:49.161
It's always a fight.

08:49.320 --> 08:52.324
But we've come back
from harder things.

08:52.480 --> 08:54.642
From further away.

08:54.840 --> 08:59.129
Glenn, Daryl, Abraham and Sasha,
they will, too.

09:04.320 --> 09:06.971
Maybe we don't wait
for them to be back.

09:08.680 --> 09:11.524
We should start figuring out how to draw
the walkers away.

09:11.680 --> 09:14.160
We have some food and water
to last us a while

09:14.360 --> 09:16.488
and the walls are holding.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.051
We can take our time.

09:18.240 --> 09:20.971
Really think this through.
Do it right.

09:21.160 --> 09:25.370
Clear it so they can--
they can walk right in.

09:29.520 --> 09:32.888
I saw Judith in the house
the other day.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.883
She's starting to--

09:37.880 --> 09:39.689
she's starting
to look like Lori.

09:40.760 --> 09:43.604
- Yeah.
- Made me happy.

09:45.360 --> 09:46.566
Me, too.

10:19.400 --> 10:21.926
( Rasping )

10:31.240 --> 10:33.242
( squelches )

11:38.640 --> 11:40.529
( rips)

11:42.000 --> 11:44.162
- ( paper crumples )
- Dad.

11:52.720 --> 11:55.690
Rick: Handguns will be a little
better for your first go.

11:55.840 --> 12:00.164
Magazine release.
Slide release.

12:00.360 --> 12:02.169
Thumb safety.

12:02.360 --> 12:03.725
That stuff's easy, right, Dad?

12:03.880 --> 12:07.805
Yeah. Empty magazine.

12:10.040 --> 12:12.361
- Empty chamber. See it?
- Yeah.

12:14.160 --> 12:17.209
Someone's in front of you,
they have a gun.

12:17.360 --> 12:20.682
You're gonna be scared.
You will be.

12:20.880 --> 12:24.930
Your body's gonna tense,
you won't have time to think.

12:25.080 --> 12:26.730
You're just gonna want
to pull the trigger

12:26.880 --> 12:28.006
when you get it in front of you.

12:28.160 --> 12:30.049
( Clicks )

12:30.200 --> 12:32.362
But you'll miss

12:32.560 --> 12:35.006
and you'll be dead.

12:35.160 --> 12:37.162
You have to get it
up to your eye.

12:38.880 --> 12:41.611
You've got to be strong enough to wait
for your moment.

12:45.040 --> 12:47.361
Can I, uh...?

12:49.840 --> 12:51.365
( Clears throat )

12:53.720 --> 12:57.406
Hey, your finger
doesn't touch the trigger

12:57.560 --> 12:59.722
until you're ready
to shoot.

13:08.520 --> 13:10.090
( Clicks )

13:10.240 --> 13:12.083
Keep that one with you.

13:12.240 --> 13:14.766
Get a feel of what it's like
to carry one around.

13:14.920 --> 13:17.287
Can I shoot it?

13:17.480 --> 13:20.290
Maybe like down
at the walkers?

13:20.480 --> 13:22.323
Rick:
No, with things how they are,

13:22.480 --> 13:24.084
the walls are strong,

13:24.280 --> 13:26.089
but we're lucky the walkers
are spread out.

13:26.280 --> 13:28.169
We don't want to pull
them all to one spot.

13:28.320 --> 13:30.721
Well, what about, like, target practice
in the center of town?

13:30.880 --> 13:33.565
'Cause then the sound will
spread out in each direction.

13:33.720 --> 13:35.961
Or maybe we could use, like, silencers
or something like that.

13:42.280 --> 13:45.090
But, uh...

13:45.240 --> 13:48.767
I mean, we probably don't want to waste
bullets right now, huh?

13:51.400 --> 13:53.641
Yeah.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.928
Just want to learn more.

13:57.120 --> 13:58.963
You will.

14:16.160 --> 14:18.367
Hey. Sorry.

14:18.520 --> 14:20.363
I was making--

14:22.160 --> 14:24.003
You want some oatmeal?

14:25.960 --> 14:28.566
Thank you.
I'm-- I'm okay.

14:28.760 --> 14:31.491
You were coming to the door.
What's up?

14:35.840 --> 14:37.683
Want me to take
a look at your arm?

14:37.840 --> 14:40.002
No, I'm not here for--

14:42.840 --> 14:44.968
I'm fine.

14:46.840 --> 14:49.366
You can tell me
if you're not.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.204
Morgan.

14:58.360 --> 15:00.044
Can we talk now?

15:00.200 --> 15:02.089
Uh-huh.

15:05.040 --> 15:07.611
What's going on?

15:07.800 --> 15:10.451
When I was coming back...
( clears throat )

15:12.360 --> 15:15.603
I tried to cut off
the herd with the RV.

15:15.760 --> 15:18.411
Lead the walkers away.

15:18.600 --> 15:21.809
But five of those people with the Ws
in their foreheads,

15:21.960 --> 15:24.281
they stopped me.

15:24.480 --> 15:27.723
They tried to kill me,
shot up the RV.

15:29.760 --> 15:33.481
Now, Carol said she saw you.

15:33.640 --> 15:35.483
That you wouldn't
kill those people.

15:35.640 --> 15:38.120
Did you let
any of them go?

15:40.120 --> 15:41.724
Yes, I did.

15:45.440 --> 15:48.046
I didn't want to kill five people
I didn't have to kill.

15:48.200 --> 15:51.249
- They burned people alive.
- Yeah.

16:02.720 --> 16:06.361
Why didn't you kill me, Rick,
back in King County?

16:07.440 --> 16:09.886
Pulled a knife on you.
I stabbed you.

16:10.040 --> 16:11.769
So why didn't you
kill me?

16:11.920 --> 16:13.649
Was it 'cause I saved you
after the hospital?

16:13.800 --> 16:15.404
'Cause I knew
who you were.

16:15.560 --> 16:18.450
Back there I would have killed you
as soon as look at you.

16:18.600 --> 16:20.648
And I tried.

16:20.800 --> 16:22.609
But you, you let me live

16:22.760 --> 16:25.764
and then I was there
to help Aaron and Daryl.

16:29.640 --> 16:32.291
See, if I--
if I wasn't there...

16:34.600 --> 16:36.682
if they died...

16:41.520 --> 16:44.649
maybe those wolves wouldn't have been
able to come back here.

16:46.960 --> 16:49.486
I don't know
what's right anymore.

16:52.080 --> 16:54.321
'Cause I did want
to kill those men.

16:54.480 --> 16:57.006
I seen what they did,
what they would've keep doing.

16:57.200 --> 16:58.611
( Sighs )

16:58.760 --> 17:01.161
I knew I could end it.

17:05.359 --> 17:08.170
But I also know
that people can change.

17:10.839 --> 17:13.844
'Cause everyone
sitting here has.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.003
All life is precious.

17:17.160 --> 17:19.367
And that idea--
that idea changed me.

17:19.520 --> 17:21.727
It brought me back
and it keeps me living.

17:21.880 --> 17:23.530
I just don't think
it can be that easy.

17:23.680 --> 17:25.329
- It's not easy.
- I wasn't saying--

17:25.520 --> 17:27.840
I-- I know.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.731
And I've thought about
letting that idea go.

17:30.880 --> 17:33.042
But I don't want to.

17:33.200 --> 17:34.884
You may have to.

17:36.360 --> 17:39.569
Things aren't as simple
as four words.

17:39.720 --> 17:41.802
I don't think they ever were.

17:41.960 --> 17:44.201
Do you think
I don't belong here?

17:44.360 --> 17:47.489
Making it now,

17:47.640 --> 17:51.690
do you really think you can do that
without getting blood on your hands?

17:57.240 --> 17:59.481
I don't know.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.245
( Walkers snarling )

18:10.440 --> 18:13.171
(wood groaning )

18:17.080 --> 18:19.731
(wood creaking )

18:21.560 --> 18:24.211
- ( wood cracks )
- ( glass shatters )

18:28.560 --> 18:31.086
( snarling continues )

18:38.400 --> 18:40.926
If we can somehow
get outside the walls,

18:41.080 --> 18:43.401
get back to our cars
at the quarry,

18:43.600 --> 18:45.204
we could use them
to draw them away.

18:45.360 --> 18:47.567
We'll set up
more watch points.

18:47.720 --> 18:49.404
Coordinate the shooting
of guns and flares

18:49.600 --> 18:52.410
so we could pull them out
in even directions.

18:52.560 --> 18:54.608
We'd need to get
all our people on it.

18:54.760 --> 18:57.923
Carl, Tara,
Rosita, Carol.

18:58.080 --> 18:59.923
What about everybody else?

19:00.080 --> 19:02.890
Well, let's just keep
this to our own for now.

19:03.040 --> 19:04.690
Really?

19:04.840 --> 19:08.606
Look, if we had the time to bring
the people along, sure.

19:08.760 --> 19:11.604
But we haven't had
a chance to catch our breath.

19:13.080 --> 19:14.844
Really?

19:15.000 --> 19:16.809
( Sighs )

19:16.960 --> 19:19.964
We're in here together.

19:20.120 --> 19:22.407
We're catching
our breath right now.

19:23.920 --> 19:26.127
Anything else
is just excuses.

19:32.680 --> 19:34.808
- ( Footsteps approach )
- Deanna.

19:34.960 --> 19:36.689
Deanna:
Rick.

19:36.840 --> 19:38.922
What's that?

19:39.080 --> 19:42.641
Plans for the expansion.

19:42.800 --> 19:45.326
We got a few other things
on our plate right now.

19:45.480 --> 19:48.211
I know.

19:48.360 --> 19:51.842
These are for what Alexandria can be
after this.

19:52.040 --> 19:53.530
Because one way
or another,

19:53.680 --> 19:56.286
there's gonna be
an after this.

20:02.720 --> 20:05.530
Now, when the blade connects,
don't jerk it right back.

20:05.720 --> 20:08.007
- You'll get stuck.
- Kent: Stuck?

20:08.160 --> 20:10.003
Like an ax cutting
into a tree.

20:10.160 --> 20:11.810
It's easier to get a blade
into bone than out.

20:11.960 --> 20:14.486
So what should we do?

20:14.640 --> 20:16.529
You should slide the machete down
through the wound.

20:16.680 --> 20:18.170
- One fluid motion.
- ( distant bang )

20:18.360 --> 20:20.886
Okay, you ease it through
the bone like this.

20:21.040 --> 20:23.520
All right?

20:23.680 --> 20:26.650
( Distant snarling )

20:26.800 --> 20:28.689
( scoffs )

20:33.000 --> 20:34.729
- ( clangs machetes )
- Hey!

20:34.920 --> 20:37.924
I'm a weapons novice
holding a significant blade here

20:38.080 --> 20:40.242
and there are people in my proximity
with open-toed shoes.

20:40.400 --> 20:43.847
That's right.
So get a grip.

20:48.200 --> 20:51.044
What are you so scared of?

20:52.680 --> 20:54.330
That would be dying.

20:54.520 --> 20:56.170
Dying is simple.

20:56.320 --> 20:59.210
It all just stops.
You're dead.

20:59.400 --> 21:01.880
The people
around you dying,

21:02.040 --> 21:04.042
that's the hard part.

21:05.280 --> 21:06.725
Okay? 'Cause you keep living

21:06.880 --> 21:10.726
knowing that they're gone

21:10.880 --> 21:12.882
and you're still here.

21:14.520 --> 21:17.922
What you should
be scared of is living

21:18.080 --> 21:21.801
knowing that you didn't do everything
you could to keep them here.

21:24.800 --> 21:27.041
Too upset
to keep going?

21:28.240 --> 21:29.810
Are the noises scaring you

21:29.960 --> 21:32.122
or can I get back
to my lesson?

21:37.880 --> 21:39.609
Let's try this again.

22:06.440 --> 22:09.091
( Walkers snarling )

22:12.280 --> 22:14.487
( muffled scream )

22:14.680 --> 22:16.967
Shh!

22:17.120 --> 22:18.531
The hell are you doing?

22:18.680 --> 22:20.808
- Shh.
- ( lock clicks )

22:20.960 --> 22:22.610
I'm taking you home.

22:22.760 --> 22:24.842
I don't know you.

22:27.640 --> 22:29.483
Why did you
give me water?

22:31.000 --> 22:32.809
I had it,
you needed it.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.962
That doesn't
make us friends.

22:35.160 --> 22:38.004
We're not friends.
I'm doing this for Maggie.

22:38.160 --> 22:39.650
Your wife?

22:39.800 --> 22:42.451
She wouldn't
leave you behind.

22:42.600 --> 22:44.409
She wouldn't want me
to leave you behind.

22:44.560 --> 22:46.847
So we're going.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.764
I'm not friends
with your wife either.

22:48.920 --> 22:51.764
I'm not having
this conversation.

22:51.920 --> 22:53.843
I'm not leaving
you out here.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.331
We're going now.

22:55.480 --> 22:57.608
No.

23:16.640 --> 23:19.211
Give me the gun, Enid.

23:21.280 --> 23:23.362
Turn around
and walk away.

23:26.040 --> 23:27.804
You're not gonna
pull the trigger.

23:27.960 --> 23:30.327
I will if you make me.

23:34.240 --> 23:36.242
Let go.

23:38.120 --> 23:40.726
Asshole.

23:40.880 --> 23:43.121
You point a gun at me
and I'm the asshole?

23:47.840 --> 23:49.330
Let's go.

23:49.480 --> 23:51.403
Out the back
down the alley.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.164
We're taking the road.
We need visibility.

23:53.320 --> 23:54.481
Why?

23:56.120 --> 23:58.122
Because half the herd
broke off

23:58.280 --> 24:00.169
and they're headed
towards home.

24:01.520 --> 24:03.409
I guess you missed that.

24:05.640 --> 24:06.971
Lead the way.

24:07.120 --> 24:09.202
( Walkers snarling )

24:41.680 --> 24:43.808
( metal squeaking )

24:54.320 --> 24:56.561
You look like
you could use some help.

25:01.720 --> 25:06.521
You know, I think we could build up
a brace on this thing.

25:15.840 --> 25:17.808
( Snarling )

25:28.680 --> 25:30.284
What?

25:35.240 --> 25:37.971
You think your wife wouldn't
have wanted me to kill it?

26:03.720 --> 26:06.041
We can use them
to distract them.

26:10.920 --> 26:13.287
There's a helium tank
in those shrubs.

26:14.280 --> 26:16.521
More balloons, more string.

26:36.600 --> 26:39.649
It don't mean anything
as long as we keep this up.

26:43.760 --> 26:46.923
You know, you scared the hell
out of people when we first saw you.

26:47.120 --> 26:48.884
I know.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.288
You scared the hell
out of me.

26:54.440 --> 26:57.205
With that beard.

26:57.360 --> 26:59.203
The way you looked around

26:59.360 --> 27:02.523
like you were seeing
things we weren't...

27:02.720 --> 27:05.246
hiding around corners.

27:05.400 --> 27:07.323
Turns out you were.

27:11.840 --> 27:16.050
Things moved slow here.

27:18.040 --> 27:21.408
And then things
just started moving fast.

27:21.560 --> 27:23.244
Too fast.

27:24.760 --> 27:27.331
But don't give up on us.

27:39.200 --> 27:41.248
Who did you
stay with back home?

27:42.600 --> 27:44.762
It's not my home.

27:50.400 --> 27:52.926
I lived in Olivia's place.

27:54.080 --> 27:57.607
But I was on my own.

27:59.280 --> 28:01.282
Orphaned by walkers.

28:01.440 --> 28:04.171
( <i>Gas</i> hisses )

28:07.000 --> 28:09.287
Me, too.

28:09.440 --> 28:11.522
Probably.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.042
It's just what happens.

28:28.960 --> 28:30.564
I get that you're scared.

28:30.720 --> 28:32.802
I'm not scared.

28:32.960 --> 28:35.247
Yeah, you are.

28:35.440 --> 28:37.442
You don't want
to lose anything again,

28:37.600 --> 28:41.650
so you give up and you say,
"That's just what happens."

28:41.800 --> 28:44.963
- I don't need a lecture.
- Yeah, I think you do.

28:45.160 --> 28:48.323
You honor the dead
by going on.

28:49.600 --> 28:51.602
Even when you're scared.

28:53.240 --> 28:56.005
You live because
they don't get to.

28:57.720 --> 28:59.882
You think your parents
wanted you

29:00.040 --> 29:02.008
waving around a gun
because you're afraid?

29:02.160 --> 29:04.049
We don't have to talk.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.402
We don't have to talk.

29:24.680 --> 29:27.001
( Cans clatter)

29:32.960 --> 29:34.849
Crap.

( walkers snarling )

30:13.280 --> 30:15.203
My God.

30:32.720 --> 30:34.449
Stop.

30:35.760 --> 30:37.205
I said stop.

30:37.360 --> 30:39.522
What's the point?

30:44.360 --> 30:46.761
The world is trying to die.

30:49.240 --> 30:51.447
We're supposed to just let it.

30:51.600 --> 30:53.887
No.

30:54.080 --> 30:56.162
You're wrong.

30:56.320 --> 30:58.084
We're not supposed
to let the world die.

30:59.680 --> 31:02.604
And I sure as hell
am not gonna let you die.

31:02.760 --> 31:04.922
I'm sure your wife
will forgive you.

31:05.080 --> 31:07.162
It's not for her anymore.

31:09.480 --> 31:11.926
Look, the walls are still up.

31:12.080 --> 31:14.481
The houses are still up.

31:14.680 --> 31:16.842
We'll find out the rest.

31:18.080 --> 31:20.048
Okay?

31:26.360 --> 31:29.887
( Metal scraping )

31:30.040 --> 31:32.088
What the hell?

31:41.640 --> 31:43.290
Rick:
Spencer.

31:43.440 --> 31:46.649
Hey, Spencer, get back here!

31:48.880 --> 31:50.120
Tara.

31:54.040 --> 31:55.201
Spencer.

31:56.280 --> 31:58.362
Spencer,
get back here now.

32:01.760 --> 32:04.001
Spencer.
Spencer, move!

Go! Keep moving!

32:17.280 --> 32:18.645
- Hurry!
- Eugene...

32:18.800 --> 32:21.007
have Maggie and Rosita
fire their guns out from their posts.

32:21.160 --> 32:23.288
- Why?
- Just do it!

32:23.440 --> 32:26.569
- Tara, I cannot in good conscience--
- Just do it!

32:32.640 --> 32:34.051
( Groans )

32:34.200 --> 32:35.850

33:21.760 --> 33:23.444
(grunts)

33:23.640 --> 33:27.884
Tara! You almost died
once for these people.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.201
What?

33:29.400 --> 33:30.970
What the hell
were you doing?

33:33.680 --> 33:36.604
Lost a damn shoe.
Crap.

33:38.160 --> 33:40.322
What was that?

33:40.480 --> 33:43.689
I was trying to help. I wanted
to get to a car, draw them away.

33:43.840 --> 33:47.322
You ever make a climb
like that before?

33:49.960 --> 33:52.804
You want to help? Don't make us
come running to save you.

33:52.960 --> 33:55.486
You got an idea,
you come to me.

33:55.640 --> 33:58.484
Would you have listened
to me?

34:06.320 --> 34:08.368
( Door opens )

34:11.880 --> 34:13.962
Everything okay now?

34:14.120 --> 34:15.849
It's handled.

34:17.679 --> 34:19.887
Everything's fine.

34:31.040 --> 34:32.724
Cheat sheets.

34:37.480 --> 34:39.687
Yeah.

34:39.840 --> 34:42.206
Probably doesn't
give you a lot of faith.

34:42.360 --> 34:44.567
I have faith.

34:44.719 --> 34:46.960
Well, you have to, right?

34:47.120 --> 34:49.726
You don't have to.
I choose to.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.161
You should, too.

34:53.360 --> 34:56.330
So are you gonna tell me
why you're here this time?

34:58.040 --> 35:01.442
How well is the community
stocked with antibiotics?

35:01.600 --> 35:04.524
We're good.

35:05.640 --> 35:07.847
I need to dress a wound,

35:08.040 --> 35:09.804
but I don't know
if it's infected.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.764
I don't want to waste medicine
if I don't have to.

35:11.960 --> 35:13.371
"FWOPP'RS."

35:13.520 --> 35:16.683
Fever, warmth, pus,
pain, redness...

35:19.080 --> 35:21.686
um...

35:21.840 --> 35:24.047
Tell me what it is.

35:28.560 --> 35:29.891
Swelling.

35:33.920 --> 35:35.649
Let's take a look
at your arm.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.445
I didn't come in this morning

35:38.600 --> 35:40.807
because I didn't want to get you
involved in something

35:40.960 --> 35:43.930
that you may not want
to be involved in.

35:44.120 --> 35:46.282
In a secret.

35:50.240 --> 35:52.447
It's not my wound.

36:48.440 --> 36:50.841
- Hi.
- Hey.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.923
I know you just took care of Judith
this morning,

36:53.080 --> 36:54.605
but they want some help
with the watch points

36:54.760 --> 36:56.250
after that thing with Spencer.
Could you...?

36:56.440 --> 36:57.680
Oh, yeah, no problem.

36:57.840 --> 36:59.001
Unless you want me
to take your shift.

36:59.160 --> 37:00.525
No, I like being up there.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.251
Even with
all them outside?

37:03.400 --> 37:06.688
You can see everything.
Even inside.

37:06.840 --> 37:09.127
Um, let me just
lock these up.

37:09.280 --> 37:10.566
- Can you give me a second?
- Mm-hmm.

37:10.720 --> 37:12.370
- Do you want to come in?
- Yeah.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.729
Sam:
Carol?

37:28.440 --> 37:29.851
Carol.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.571
What, Sam?

37:34.760 --> 37:36.842
Sam?

37:38.480 --> 37:40.369
What happens if you
can't live with it?

37:40.520 --> 37:43.569
I told you,
it eats you up.

37:43.720 --> 37:46.246
Can you come down here?
I can barely hear you.

37:48.200 --> 37:51.090
The people who came,

37:51.240 --> 37:53.288
were they the monsters?

37:55.520 --> 37:57.602
Did my dad turn into one?

37:57.760 --> 37:59.285
What?

37:59.440 --> 38:01.727
If you kill people,

38:01.920 --> 38:04.764
do you turn into
one of the monsters?

38:07.040 --> 38:10.362
The only thing that keeps you
from becoming a monster is killing.

38:18.560 --> 38:20.289
( Door opens )

38:23.160 --> 38:26.004
- Thank you for this.
- Oh, yeah, no problem.

38:26.160 --> 38:28.925
Yeah.
Bye-bye.

38:38.760 --> 38:40.967
Who the hell do you
have in that cell?

39:20.480 --> 39:23.131
- ( Wood creaking )
- ( walkers snarling )

39:28.800 --> 39:31.041
Hey, you seen Denise?

39:31.200 --> 39:32.645
No.

39:36.960 --> 39:38.644
( Sighs )

39:38.800 --> 39:40.325
I'll be right back.

39:43.160 --> 39:45.083
<i>He'! '</i>

39:45.240 --> 39:47.527
Look, I'm sorry
about before.

39:47.680 --> 39:50.286
- I was just--
- He was stupid. That we know.

39:50.440 --> 39:54.001
I just meant what you did for him,
you didn't have to.

39:54.200 --> 39:56.282
I know.

39:56.440 --> 39:58.204
You could have died.

39:58.360 --> 40:00.727
I mean, I'd like to say
I was thinking about it,

40:00.880 --> 40:02.769
but I wasn't.

40:02.960 --> 40:05.167
Is that why you did it?

40:05.320 --> 40:07.209
You weren't thinking
about it?

40:09.520 --> 40:12.569
No, that's how
it works with us.

40:12.760 --> 40:14.649
We're stuck with
each other, right?

40:14.800 --> 40:16.131

40:16.280 --> 40:18.567
Deanna:
Rick, you saved my son.

40:18.720 --> 40:20.961
Thank you.

40:21.120 --> 40:23.043
Thank Tara.

40:23.200 --> 40:25.202
I already did.

40:28.600 --> 40:30.682
Now I'm thanking you.

40:31.680 --> 40:34.365
What Spencer did
was stupid.

40:34.520 --> 40:36.488
I can't argue that.

40:36.640 --> 40:39.484
- At least he tried.
- That's not the point.

40:39.640 --> 40:41.722
I could have tried.

40:41.880 --> 40:43.723
There was a chance.

40:43.880 --> 40:45.769
How's that?

40:45.960 --> 40:49.328
When the walkers were going for him,
it made a gap.

40:49.480 --> 40:51.528
I could have jumped down,
ran, made it out.

40:51.680 --> 40:55.127
I could have got in a car,
used it to lead the walkers away.

40:55.280 --> 40:58.329
I could have done that
and Spencer would be dead.

40:58.480 --> 41:02.485
But you didn't do that.
Why?

41:04.680 --> 41:07.001
I helped save him
because he's your son.

41:09.240 --> 41:11.208
Wrong answer.

41:55.440 --> 41:57.363
That's Glenn. That's Glenn.
