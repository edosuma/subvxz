00:58.884 --> 01:02.236
Mom? Dad?

01:12.768 --> 01:14.161
Hello?

01:17.990 --> 01:19.949
I can hear you.

01:19.992 --> 01:21.777
Come on, open up.

01:37.009 --> 01:37.967
No!

01:41.884 --> 01:46.497
Dylan, are you okay?

02:03.253 --> 02:05.255
Jeez.

02:12.915 --> 02:16.527
You know what?
I think I need sexier
toiletries for this bathroom.

02:16.571 --> 02:17.876
I really do.

02:17.920 --> 02:21.619
I think Dylan is finally
down for good.

02:21.663 --> 02:23.795
He had a bad nightmare.

02:23.839 --> 02:24.927
Another one?

02:26.494 --> 02:28.148
Damn.

02:28.191 --> 02:30.324
Poor little guy.
You know what?

02:30.367 --> 02:32.543
I think it's just
new house jitters.

02:32.587 --> 02:35.981
A couple days, and he
will love this place.

02:36.025 --> 02:37.200
And so will you.

02:37.244 --> 02:40.160
Look at this.
Baby, two sinks.

02:40.203 --> 02:43.554
We never have to share
another one again. Come on!

02:43.598 --> 02:45.513
- Yeah, that part I like.
- Yeah, well,

02:45.556 --> 02:48.516
'cause we deserve this.
We've earned it, okay?

02:48.559 --> 02:52.172
- Do we?
- Yeah.

02:52.215 --> 02:54.957
You know, I want us
to be careful and not
overextend ourselves.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.133
- I know.
- That's how people
get trapped,

02:57.177 --> 02:58.874
like my parents when--

03:02.138 --> 03:06.403
That black car,
it's been idling for 20 minutes.

03:06.447 --> 03:08.753
- Oh.
- Feels like it's watching us.

03:08.797 --> 03:11.191
What black car?

03:13.323 --> 03:16.848
It was right there.

03:16.892 --> 03:18.807
I think I saw it earlier, too.

03:18.850 --> 03:20.722
Oh, no.

03:20.765 --> 03:24.856
I don't think Dylan's
the only one with
new house jitters.

03:24.900 --> 03:27.032
Now that he's asleep,

03:27.076 --> 03:29.121
what do you say we christen
this house, huh?

03:31.254 --> 03:34.344
In there. Right there.

04:06.637 --> 04:10.206
♪ Hey, man,
what's that sound? ♪

04:10.250 --> 04:14.210

05:44.256 --> 05:48.957
Oh, man, I am having some
serious house FOMO right now.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.177
How the hell did Adam
afford this place?

05:52.221 --> 05:54.223
Must be under
a flight path or something.

05:54.266 --> 05:56.965
Yeah. All I know is
that he got a great deal.

05:57.008 --> 05:59.184
I got so pissed off
checking the Zillow,
I almost didn't come.

06:00.925 --> 06:03.624
At least he's not being smug
by having a party

06:03.667 --> 06:05.582
just to rub it
in everyone's faces.

06:05.626 --> 06:07.410
Totally.
Not a smug prick at all.

06:14.286 --> 06:15.723
Yo, yo, yo, yo, my peeps!

06:15.766 --> 06:18.595
If I could just have
a minute of your time.

06:18.639 --> 06:21.598
Just a minute.
Thanks so much.

06:21.642 --> 06:25.820
Uh, yeah, thank you guys
so much for being here.

06:25.863 --> 06:27.604
Margo and I are so excited
to have you guys

06:27.648 --> 06:29.432
for our little
housewarming party.

06:29.476 --> 06:32.043
#AdamAndMargosCrib,
by the way.

06:35.090 --> 06:37.614
Uh, you know, I used to love
coming up to the hills to hike.

06:37.658 --> 06:39.616
And I am pinching myself

06:39.660 --> 06:41.836
that we actually
live up here now.

06:41.879 --> 06:44.055
So-- honestly,
it doesn't matter

06:44.099 --> 06:46.623
how cool the decor
or how big the pool is.

06:46.667 --> 06:49.060
- Cringe.
- A home is only as good

06:49.104 --> 06:51.454
as the friends who fill it.

06:51.498 --> 06:52.629
- I mean that.
- Whoo-whoo!

06:52.673 --> 06:54.631
Yeah.

06:54.675 --> 06:59.070
Um, everyone here
is so special to us,
so, uh...

07:03.074 --> 07:04.902
Uh-- yeah. Cheers.

07:04.946 --> 07:08.689
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

07:16.784 --> 07:18.525
Sounds like a fun party.

07:18.568 --> 07:20.875
Don't you want to go out there,
show off the new house?

07:20.918 --> 07:23.355
I guess I should.

07:23.399 --> 07:28.883
But I'm just, like,
what was so bad with our
old place, you know?

07:28.926 --> 07:30.928
God, what is wrong with me?

07:30.972 --> 07:33.931
Oh, the oven door's sticky.
I can get it.

07:33.975 --> 07:38.893
I got it. I got it.
Thank you.

07:38.936 --> 07:43.767
You should go out there,
have fun.

07:43.811 --> 07:47.118
Or else.

07:47.162 --> 07:50.034
Okay. Okay. Thanks, Brooke.

07:50.078 --> 07:52.820
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

07:52.863 --> 07:54.691
Can we go yet?

07:54.735 --> 07:57.912
No, we haven't
even talked to Margo.

07:57.955 --> 08:00.915
I can't be hungover
for gun club, all right?

08:00.958 --> 08:04.005
Besides, this crowd's
really snobby.

08:04.048 --> 08:05.006
15 more minutes?

08:05.049 --> 08:06.224
No, no, no, 20 minutes,

08:06.268 --> 08:07.617
then we're out the door.

08:23.677 --> 08:25.505
This house has
such an unusual layout.

08:25.548 --> 08:27.811
I can't seem
to find the bathroom.

08:27.855 --> 08:31.162
Oh, the bathroom's right here.

08:31.206 --> 08:35.210
Oh, well, silly me.
I must be drunk.

08:35.253 --> 08:37.255
Please, I wouldn't dream
of going first.

08:37.299 --> 08:39.736
Okay.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.397
Oh! Hey, my dudes.

08:48.440 --> 08:49.920
Hey, please don't touch
the vinyl.

08:49.964 --> 08:51.705
If you want to hear something,
I'll put it on.

08:51.748 --> 08:53.489
Let me know, let me know.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.230
Hey, you guys trying one
of my famous Old Fashions?

08:55.273 --> 08:58.015
- I actually had
a question about that.
- Yeah, one second.

08:58.059 --> 09:00.409
Hey, did you guys
try the dessert?

09:00.452 --> 09:04.239
Le Petit's? Pretty good.
Check it out.

09:04.282 --> 09:09.287
Keep those drinks filled.
Come on, we're going all night.
We're going all night.

09:09.331 --> 09:12.813
Neil, Lily.
Hey, you guys can't leave yet.

09:12.856 --> 09:15.206
I mean, you're practically
the guests of honor. Come on.

09:15.250 --> 09:18.253
We have a thing
in the morning.

09:18.296 --> 09:20.472
But really great place.
Top notch.

09:20.516 --> 09:22.605
- I'll see you Monday.
- Really lovely home.

09:22.649 --> 09:25.477
- Thanks for having us, Alan.
- It's, uh, Adam.

09:25.521 --> 09:27.828
You try one of
my famous Old Fashions?

09:27.871 --> 09:29.264
They're famous!

09:32.093 --> 09:34.574
- Let's get outta here.
- Why wake Dylan up?

09:34.617 --> 09:37.489
The babysitter texted.
Kids are all dead asleep.

09:37.533 --> 09:39.100
You know he's a handful.

09:39.143 --> 09:41.581
And, plus, he's had some
really bad nightmares lately.

09:41.624 --> 09:43.495
That's all the more reason
to let him spend the night,

09:43.539 --> 09:45.236
and the kids love
having him there.

09:45.280 --> 09:47.195
You sure?

09:47.238 --> 09:49.414
He's not used
to sleeping away from home,
so he might wake up again--

09:49.458 --> 09:52.809
Relax, Mom.
We'll drive him up
in the morning.

09:52.853 --> 09:55.246
You just enjoy
your night off.

09:55.290 --> 09:57.814
- Hey, killer party!
- Hey, hope you guys
had a good--

09:57.858 --> 09:59.337
- Hey, uh, thanks
for the drinks, man.
- Good night.

09:59.381 --> 10:01.470
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Let's roll, babe.

10:01.513 --> 10:02.645
- Good night.
- Good night.

10:02.689 --> 10:03.864
See ya.

10:07.868 --> 10:10.087
It's okay, it's over.

10:13.177 --> 10:15.832
Hey, why did Neil
and his wife
leave so early?

10:15.876 --> 10:18.400
I mean, do you think
people had fun?

10:18.443 --> 10:20.271
Sure, yeah.

10:20.315 --> 10:22.491
You're not just saying that?

10:22.534 --> 10:25.233
You know I'm not
the best judge.

10:25.276 --> 10:27.627
Well, I mean,
Kevin didn't come.

10:27.670 --> 10:29.454
Brad Thompson didn't show up.

10:29.498 --> 10:31.543
That was kind of
the whole point.

10:31.587 --> 10:33.633
I thought the point
was to have fun?

10:33.676 --> 10:36.461
You know what I mean.

10:36.505 --> 10:39.116
Well, it was mostly
your work friends.

10:39.160 --> 10:41.249
I didn't know half of them.

10:41.292 --> 10:44.469
Yeah, I tried to introduce you.
I couldn't really find you.

10:44.513 --> 10:47.037
You used to love parties.

10:47.081 --> 10:49.039
- Did I?
- Yeah.

10:49.083 --> 10:52.782
I just feel like I--
like, we've barely unpacked.

10:52.826 --> 10:56.481
And I don't even know how
to end a conversation anymore.

10:56.525 --> 10:58.048
I mean, a lot of your friends
were here, too, you know?

10:58.092 --> 11:01.835
Like Teeny and her
super-friendly husband.

11:01.878 --> 11:03.575
Brooke the cook.

11:03.619 --> 11:06.709
- That super slick couple.
- Who?

11:06.753 --> 11:09.538
You know, that couple.
That guy was wearing,
like, a really cool suit

11:09.581 --> 11:13.237
and she was wearing a dress
that looked like jammies.

11:13.281 --> 11:16.893
Wait, that couple
that looked like they were
going to a sexy funeral?

11:16.937 --> 11:19.330
- Yeah, that's the one.
- They're your friends.

11:19.374 --> 11:21.724
No, I don't know them.

11:21.768 --> 11:24.727
- Are you sure
you don't know them?
- No, I do not know them.

11:24.771 --> 11:25.902
Didn't you talk to them?

11:25.946 --> 11:28.383
No, I didn't get a chance to.

11:28.426 --> 11:30.080
Maybe they came
with someone else.

11:30.124 --> 11:32.343
Yeah, maybe.

11:32.387 --> 11:34.128
I mean, pretty rude
to bring another couple

11:34.171 --> 11:38.959
to a super curated gathering
and not introduce them, but...

11:39.002 --> 11:43.877
Yeah, it's really weird.
Where's the cheese knife?

11:43.920 --> 11:45.574
So random.

11:46.749 --> 11:49.143
Who invited them?

12:19.651 --> 12:21.392
- Fuck!
- Whoa.

12:21.436 --> 12:23.786
Easy there.
I'm sorry, I was just--

12:23.830 --> 12:25.701
- I didn't mean to scare you.
- Hey, hey. What the hell?

12:25.745 --> 12:28.530
- I come in peace.
I come in peace.
- What is going on?

12:28.573 --> 12:30.706
I gave our hosts
a little scare.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.753
It seems like we lost
track of time in the toilet.

12:33.796 --> 12:36.364
Oh, my God. Um, are we--

12:36.407 --> 12:38.496
- we're the only ones left?
- Bingo.

12:38.540 --> 12:39.759
Yeah, what the hell were
you guys doing in there?

12:39.802 --> 12:42.370
Uh, that-- that's our cue.

12:42.413 --> 12:43.763
Exit stage left.

12:43.806 --> 12:45.373
Thank you guys
for a great time.

12:45.416 --> 12:47.157
A thousand pardons
about the scare, so...

12:47.201 --> 12:49.159
- Good night. Thank you.
- So sorry.

12:51.248 --> 12:52.946
What the fuck?

12:52.989 --> 12:54.164
Just-- hold on.

12:54.208 --> 12:55.383
You know what?
I have to ask.

12:55.426 --> 12:57.602
- Adam.
- Who invited you?

12:57.646 --> 13:01.955
Oh. I find myself in
the unenviable position

13:01.998 --> 13:04.131
of having to apologize
twice in just minutes.

13:04.174 --> 13:08.048
We weren't actually invited
in a formal sense.

13:08.091 --> 13:09.701
Or the informal sense.

13:09.745 --> 13:11.660
- What?
- Okay, well,

13:11.703 --> 13:12.835
all the more reason
for you to leave.

13:12.879 --> 13:14.315
- Yeah.
- Bye, guys.

13:14.358 --> 13:17.927
One of your guests
was blocking our car.

13:17.971 --> 13:21.452
Yep, we're the neighbors.
I'm Tom. This is Sasha.

13:21.496 --> 13:23.454
- Hi.
- Welcome to the neighborhood.

13:23.498 --> 13:25.456
Wait, the neighbors?

13:25.500 --> 13:28.242
Mm-hmm. Yeah, someone's Prius
ran over two of our lawn lights

13:28.285 --> 13:30.244
and was blocking our driveway.

13:30.287 --> 13:32.855
So we came over here
with a head full of steam
to complain--

13:32.899 --> 13:34.465
- Mostly me.
- And then--

13:34.509 --> 13:36.250
Well, you have
really nice friends

13:36.293 --> 13:38.252
and you make
a mean Old Fashioned.

13:38.295 --> 13:41.037
And your playlist?

13:41.081 --> 13:44.258
Chef's kiss. I mean,
some serious deep cuts.

13:44.301 --> 13:46.564
That Radiohead song?
I don't think I've ever
heard that song before.

13:46.608 --> 13:49.045
Oh, it's actually
an old DJ Shadow remix

13:49.089 --> 13:50.264
- off a limited picture disk
pressing from Japan.
- Unh-uh.

13:50.307 --> 13:51.874
- No, not right now.
- Sorry.

13:51.918 --> 13:53.484
You know, I know
we sound like lunatics.

13:53.528 --> 13:55.660
We came over here
just for a drink as a lark,

13:55.704 --> 13:58.663
and then, you know, well,
one thing led to the next

13:58.707 --> 14:01.666
and we really
should have introduced
ourselves right off.

14:01.710 --> 14:04.321
- It's my fault.
- Gee, you think?

14:04.365 --> 14:06.323
Oh, hey, so,
you live next door, huh?

14:06.367 --> 14:08.543
The big mid-century?
Fucking love that house, man.

14:08.586 --> 14:11.894
Oh, good. I mean,
please come over any time.
God knows we owe you.

14:11.938 --> 14:16.899
Yeah, I'm actually
having a launch party for
my jewelry line next month.

14:16.943 --> 14:19.119
And we're gonna
probably tent the yard

14:19.162 --> 14:21.338
and I'm gonna have
my favorite sushi
restaurant cater.

14:21.382 --> 14:23.123
- So, please come.
- Yeah, and the best part is,

14:23.166 --> 14:26.126
you can get as drunk
as you want and just
stumble back home.

14:26.169 --> 14:27.997
- We're so close.
- Yeah.

14:28.041 --> 14:30.086
Anyways, we're really sorry
for making this weird.

14:30.130 --> 14:32.306
- I guess we're a little
too old for party crashing.
- We are.

14:32.349 --> 14:35.352
Oh, come on, bro.
I give you mad props.
Right here.

14:35.396 --> 14:37.093
Yeah, like we haven't
crashed a party. Please.

14:37.137 --> 14:38.790
Yeah, yeah.
Bro, we haven't.

14:38.834 --> 14:41.837
- Oh, I have.
Years ago, but--
- He hasn't.

14:41.881 --> 14:45.536
Can we hit the reset button?

14:45.580 --> 14:47.060
- We're kinda wired.
- Yeah.

14:47.103 --> 14:49.497
Can we invite you guys
over for a nightcap?

14:49.540 --> 14:51.151
Oh, that's
a great idea.
- Yeah?

14:51.194 --> 14:52.935
- Although our place
is such a mess.
- Oh.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.415
We're remodeling.
We're doing some work.

14:54.458 --> 14:55.546
Too bad.

14:55.590 --> 14:57.722
Um, yeah,
that is so tempting,

14:57.766 --> 15:00.073
but we are gonna rain check.

15:00.116 --> 15:02.292
Yeah, there's actually no reason
for us to go over there...

15:02.336 --> 15:04.381
- Yeah, exactly.
- ...when we have
everything right here.

15:04.425 --> 15:06.775
- Adam.
- Everything.

15:06.818 --> 15:10.822
I mean, we don't
want to intrude.
It's up to-- I mean...

15:10.866 --> 15:12.346
Nightcap?

15:12.389 --> 15:14.957
- Come on. Let's do it.
- Sure, yeah.

15:15.001 --> 15:17.917
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:20.223 --> 15:22.399
God, I hate the Hills.

15:24.967 --> 15:27.143
Who were those
hipster tight-asses?

15:27.187 --> 15:32.366
There was this
one younger couple,
very stylish.

15:32.409 --> 15:36.457
Yeah, that's their crowd now.
No skin off my nose.

15:36.500 --> 15:39.808
I think I caught the guy
snooping or something.

15:39.851 --> 15:41.592
Something was off.

15:41.636 --> 15:44.508
He gave me the strangest look.

15:45.553 --> 15:47.598
- Oh!
- Fuck!

15:47.642 --> 15:49.165
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

15:49.209 --> 15:50.601
Tell me that
wasn't an animal, Frank.

15:50.645 --> 15:52.690
Frank, tell me
that wasn't an animal.

15:52.734 --> 15:54.866
It wasn't an animal.

15:56.738 --> 15:58.348
Stay here.

16:31.077 --> 16:32.861
Relax, babe, okay?
It was nothing.

16:32.904 --> 16:34.384
It was just a branch.

16:34.428 --> 16:37.909
What are you talking about?
We hit something.

16:37.953 --> 16:40.390
Yeah, I'm telling you,
there was nothing in the road.

16:40.434 --> 16:45.613
Well, what if it
slunked off the road
and it's in pain now?

16:45.656 --> 16:47.223
Okay, it was a branch.

16:47.267 --> 16:50.487
There's branches flying around.
End of story.

16:52.272 --> 16:53.925
Fucking hate the Hills.

17:02.108 --> 17:03.544
Need some help, doctor?

17:03.587 --> 17:06.112
Hey, so, uh, you have fun?

17:06.155 --> 17:07.852
The party was a good time?

17:07.896 --> 17:10.986
- Yeah! Fun little crowd.
- Yeah, okay. Cool.

17:11.030 --> 17:15.121
- Just nice to step outside
my bubble, for a change.
- Totally.

17:15.164 --> 17:17.775
Uh, what is your bubble?

17:17.819 --> 17:22.128
Oh, you know, other VCs,
CEOs, entrepreneurs.

17:22.171 --> 17:24.739
You know, total pricks. Yeah.

17:24.782 --> 17:27.524
Well, I wish there were
a few more total pricks
here tonight.

17:27.568 --> 17:30.875
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, I-- I don't
want to bore you.

17:30.919 --> 17:35.097
- No, try me.
- So, I invited my boss
to sell him on expanding.

17:35.141 --> 17:36.968
Our firm is missing
so many opportunities

17:37.012 --> 17:38.622
by not beefing up
our online content.

17:38.666 --> 17:40.537
- Mm.
- It's like we farm out
so much ad work

17:40.581 --> 17:44.759
that it keeps us from
competing with the big boys.
Very frustrating.

17:44.802 --> 17:46.543
You ever think about
launching your own company?

17:46.587 --> 17:48.763
Only every day.

17:48.806 --> 17:51.766
- I may have some people
to introduce you to.
- Wait, really?

17:51.809 --> 17:54.334
Yeah, but let's not ruin
our drinks with business.

17:54.377 --> 17:55.857
- No, I didn't mean to--
- That's what the golf
course is for.

17:55.900 --> 17:57.206
- Yeah.
- You play?

17:57.250 --> 18:00.079
- Oh, yeah.
- Good. You can teach me.

18:00.122 --> 18:03.647
I just spent a fortune
to join the big new club
and I totally suck.

18:03.691 --> 18:06.215
Great. That'd be fun.

18:08.609 --> 18:10.654
Oh, sexy couple.

18:10.698 --> 18:14.615
- That was before
I got pregnant.
- Oh, okay.

18:14.658 --> 18:18.358
If I knew I was saying goodbye
to vacations and my hips,

18:18.401 --> 18:20.011
I would've taken more photos.

18:20.055 --> 18:21.578
Oh, you're selling
yourself short.

18:21.622 --> 18:23.145
But I know exactly
what you mean.

18:23.189 --> 18:25.365
I remind Jean Pierre
of that all the time.

18:25.408 --> 18:27.149
Does that make me horrible?

18:27.193 --> 18:30.761
You're so young.
You have a child?

18:30.805 --> 18:33.808
Yeah, I do.
He's-- he's six already.

18:33.851 --> 18:36.811
- That's Dylan's age. Yeah.
- Really?

18:36.854 --> 18:40.380
JP's actually
doing a language
immersion program.

18:40.423 --> 18:42.817
It's a spring break program.
He's in Montreal.

18:42.860 --> 18:45.036
So he's actually
visiting his grandmother,

18:45.080 --> 18:49.040
- but very independent kid.
- Yeah, of course. At six.

18:49.084 --> 18:51.217
- Yeah.
- Wow, you two,

18:51.260 --> 18:54.785
- you really have it all.
- Oh, my God, no!

18:54.829 --> 18:57.179
- No, it's an act. I swear.
- Oh. Oh, come on.

18:57.223 --> 19:00.182
Most married couples I know
don't attack each other
in the bathroom.

19:00.226 --> 19:02.358
- Oh.
- Or do they?
I'm so sorry.

19:02.402 --> 19:05.535
- I don't even know anymore.
- No, no, no.
We weren't doing that.

19:05.579 --> 19:07.668
It's fine.
You don't need to say that
to make me feel better.

19:07.711 --> 19:10.105
No, really.
It's embarrassing, actually.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.673
We were just
doing a little coke.
It's so '80s.

19:12.716 --> 19:14.892
- Oh. In my house.
- I know. Don't judge me.

19:14.936 --> 19:16.198
- Wow.
- I'm so sorry.

19:16.242 --> 19:19.158
Yeah, no. No, no, no.
It is totally fine.

19:19.201 --> 19:22.987
Yeah, I did my share
way back when.

19:23.031 --> 19:25.903
- Okay. Yeah, no, it's gross.
- It's so gross.

19:25.947 --> 19:28.645
- And silly. Yeah.
- And it is so silly.

19:28.689 --> 19:32.475
Do you have any left?

19:34.912 --> 19:37.872
Whoa! While the cat's away,

19:37.915 --> 19:40.004
the mice will break out
the booger sugar.

19:40.048 --> 19:43.660
- Margo, what the fuck?
- It's one line.

19:43.704 --> 19:45.662
Well, yeah, but--
nothing against you guys,

19:45.706 --> 19:46.881
you know,
or Colombian exports,

19:46.924 --> 19:48.361
it's just I know how she gets.

19:48.404 --> 19:51.233
How I get?

19:51.277 --> 19:54.889
He has no idea how I get.

19:54.932 --> 19:56.717
Well, I think we're all
about to find out.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.458
Sasha, don't be a troublemaker.

19:58.501 --> 20:01.635
She's a confirmed troublemaker.
Total maniac.

20:01.678 --> 20:04.028
I am the voice of reason
compared to this one.

20:04.072 --> 20:05.029
Okay, we actually--
we trade off,

20:05.073 --> 20:06.466
like good cop, bad cop.

20:06.509 --> 20:09.077
That's the key
to a successful marriage.

20:10.252 --> 20:12.863
Tonight, I'm the maniac.

20:12.907 --> 20:15.257
Yeah.

20:15.301 --> 20:16.780
Hey, fine with me.

20:16.824 --> 20:17.825
I've been trying to get you
out of your shell

20:17.868 --> 20:19.392
the whole night,
so have at it.

20:19.435 --> 20:22.264
Well, on that note,
can I put on a little music?

20:22.308 --> 20:25.136
Yeah. A couple notes
about the music.

20:25.180 --> 20:27.661
Oh, yeah, Adam doesn't like
anyone touching his wax.

20:27.704 --> 20:30.446
Ooh, I'm sorry.
Is this-- is this all right?

20:30.490 --> 20:33.275
No, that rule is for Dylan,
our son, and most people.

20:33.319 --> 20:35.190
Yep, and including me.

20:36.626 --> 20:38.889
Hey, pick a good one, bud.
Pick a goodie.

20:38.933 --> 20:43.285
Famous last words.
Okay, I am getting warmer.

20:43.329 --> 20:46.114
Pressure's on, Tom.
I want to dance.

20:46.157 --> 20:49.117
I know you do, baby.
Uh, okay, I'm getting--

20:49.160 --> 20:51.902
Adam, wow.
Just some top-notch
stuff here.

20:51.946 --> 20:54.731
Just an embarrassment
of riches.

20:54.775 --> 20:57.865
Okay, I'm getting warm-- ugh.

20:57.908 --> 21:01.912
Warmer, and...

21:04.567 --> 21:06.047
I think we have a winner.

21:06.090 --> 21:08.179
- Oh!
- Good one.

21:08.223 --> 21:11.966
- Yeah, that's--
- Let's dance.

21:32.378 --> 21:34.510
Getting a little loud.
Maybe I'll turn it down
for the neighbors.

21:34.554 --> 21:36.686
Ah, fuck that.

21:36.730 --> 21:39.254
We are the neighbors!

21:39.298 --> 21:40.995
Yeah!

21:59.013 --> 22:00.841
No!

22:14.071 --> 22:16.770
- Well?
- Not good.

22:16.813 --> 22:19.207
Dylan had a nightmare
and wet himself.

22:19.250 --> 22:22.036
Something about Mommy and Daddy
getting all cut up.

22:22.079 --> 22:24.386
Jesus.

22:24.430 --> 22:27.433
Well, his mom did say
he was a little weirdo.

22:27.476 --> 22:28.869
Yeah, he wants his pookie.

22:28.912 --> 22:32.133
- His what?
- It's his stuffed monkey.

22:32.176 --> 22:34.222
Maybe we should just
bring him back.

22:34.265 --> 22:36.790
No, no, no.
This is a sleepover.

22:36.833 --> 22:38.618
The kids would be
so disappointed.

22:38.661 --> 22:40.402
Okay, so text Margo.
Have her bring it down.

22:40.446 --> 22:42.012
I'm sure she's still
cleaning or whatever.

22:42.056 --> 22:43.753
Well, I did
and she didn't answer.

22:43.797 --> 22:44.798
I need Pookie.

22:44.841 --> 22:45.799
- Oh, my God.
- Jesus.

22:45.842 --> 22:48.236
I can't sleep without him.

22:48.279 --> 22:50.107
Oh, okay, honey.

22:50.151 --> 22:52.632
Well, I'll be out there
in a sec, okay?

22:56.287 --> 22:57.550
I'm just gonna go get it.

22:57.593 --> 22:58.855
- No, I'll go.
- No, I'm already up.

22:58.899 --> 23:00.857
Back in a flash.

23:05.775 --> 23:08.299
A longer barrel
means less recoil

23:08.343 --> 23:09.953
but more propellant
for your bullet,

23:09.997 --> 23:12.434
as well as a higher
muzzle velocity.

23:22.923 --> 23:26.405
- This is so much fun!
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

23:26.448 --> 23:28.102
Oh, this is way more fun
than the party.

23:28.145 --> 23:31.497
Well, that's why we moved, baby.
Higher caliber of people.

23:31.540 --> 23:34.108
Adam! Eww! Oh, my God.

23:34.151 --> 23:36.850
Wait. Are we the more
higher caliber people?

23:36.893 --> 23:38.678
Hey, we'll take it.
We're flattered.

23:38.721 --> 23:41.855
Tom fancies himself, like,
the mayor of the Hills, okay?

23:41.898 --> 23:43.465
He'll introduce you
to everyone.

23:46.163 --> 23:48.296
Oh, my God, I love this song.

23:48.339 --> 23:50.298
Such a great tune.

23:50.341 --> 23:53.301
♪ I've been living
life so long ♪

23:53.344 --> 23:57.392
♪ I know there's
nothing wrong with this ♪

23:57.436 --> 24:01.483
♪ Come on, break my heart

24:01.527 --> 24:05.182
♪ Break my heart

24:05.226 --> 24:09.535
♪ Well, let's say

24:09.578 --> 24:13.408
♪ This evil little world

24:13.452 --> 24:17.456
♪ Break my heart

24:17.499 --> 24:20.415
♪ Break my-- break my--
break my-- ♪

24:20.459 --> 24:22.156
Adam.

24:22.199 --> 24:23.723
Oh, got it. Sorry.

24:25.942 --> 24:27.988
What? How is this
skipping right now?

24:28.031 --> 24:29.511
I take such good care of it.

24:29.555 --> 24:31.426
It's okay.
I'll get you a new one.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.167
Yeah, fat chance.
Limited press.

24:33.210 --> 24:34.821
I said I'll get you a new one.

24:36.170 --> 24:37.388
You know what I'd love
right now?

24:37.432 --> 24:40.174
A cigarette. Oh!

24:40.217 --> 24:43.177
Smoking? Really? Again?
Wow, who are you?

24:43.220 --> 24:45.527
Well, I hate to trigger
an international incident,

24:45.571 --> 24:47.442
- but I do happen
to have one left.
- Oh!

24:47.486 --> 24:49.618
Me! Me, me.

24:49.662 --> 24:51.446
And you'd be doing
my health a great service
by splitting it with me.

24:51.490 --> 24:54.580
Don't hate me.

25:07.810 --> 25:11.988
- I hope I'm not being
a bad influence.
- Don't mind Adam.

25:12.032 --> 25:14.425
In front of people,
he likes to put me
in the Mommy box.

25:14.469 --> 25:18.081
Oh, my God.
Yeah, Tom did that once.

25:18.125 --> 25:20.954
He asked me what
I was making for lunch
in front of his mother.

25:20.997 --> 25:23.434
- Oh.
- So I walked out
the front door,

25:23.478 --> 25:26.829
bought a motorcycle,
and I let my jujitsu
teacher go down on me.

25:28.135 --> 25:30.790
- You did that?
- Yeah.

25:30.833 --> 25:33.836
That is amazing.

25:41.061 --> 25:44.630
You have strong hands.

25:44.673 --> 25:46.806
Hard tips.

25:46.849 --> 25:47.807
Piano?

25:47.850 --> 25:51.550
- Guitar.
- Oh.

25:56.467 --> 25:58.818
Play me something.

25:58.861 --> 25:59.993
Yeah, down here, we're gonna
make this a home gym.

26:00.036 --> 26:01.342
- Mm.
- Kinda sweet.

26:01.385 --> 26:04.345
And down that away,
home office.

26:04.388 --> 26:07.653
Wow, this-- this is
a great little house.

26:07.696 --> 26:11.004
- Ah.
- Work must not be as dire
as you make it sound.

26:11.047 --> 26:14.660
We got a good deal.
Some might even say a steal.

26:14.703 --> 26:18.664
- Yeah?
- Yeah, 'cause of
the history of the house.

26:18.707 --> 26:21.754
- History?
- Wait. You don't know?

26:21.797 --> 26:26.846
- No, what history?
- I mean, it happened
so long ago.

26:26.889 --> 26:30.284
Um, and, you know,
our realtor didn't have to
legally disclose it to us,

26:30.327 --> 26:32.591
but it still pops up on some
of those morbid websites

26:32.634 --> 26:35.071
- every once in a while, so...
- Do tell.

26:35.115 --> 26:38.640
- But if I have nightmares,
I'm blaming you.
- All right.

26:38.684 --> 26:41.338
So, basically
this family lived here
like 15, 20 years ago.

26:41.382 --> 26:44.298
Picture-perfect family.
The husband owned a restaurant.

26:44.341 --> 26:47.518
The wife was like
an artist or something.
They had twins.

26:47.562 --> 26:50.521
- Gross.
Twins gross me out.
- Same.

26:50.565 --> 26:52.654
So, this couple
fought all the time.

26:52.698 --> 26:55.309
Like, really ugly fighting
for years. Violent.

26:55.352 --> 26:56.745
The whole neighborhood
knew about it,

26:56.789 --> 26:58.312
but nobody could say
anything because it's like,

26:58.355 --> 27:01.576
"Oh, upscale neighborhood.
What do we say?" Right?

27:01.620 --> 27:05.188
But, um, eventually
it escalated pretty bad.

27:05.232 --> 27:08.583
And, uh, yeah,
he slit her throat

27:08.627 --> 27:11.107
and she shot him in the face.

27:11.151 --> 27:13.109
Jesus.

27:13.153 --> 27:14.328
Or maybe it was
the other way around.

27:14.371 --> 27:15.459
She slit his throat

27:15.503 --> 27:16.896
and he shot her in the face.

27:16.939 --> 27:18.898
Whoa.

27:18.941 --> 27:21.204
The worst part is--
the worst part?

27:21.248 --> 27:24.599
- Yeah?
- The kids never
called the police.

27:24.643 --> 27:25.905
I mean, obviously
they're traumatized.

27:25.948 --> 27:27.950
You know, years
of deranged parents

27:27.994 --> 27:30.561
and then this, obviously.

27:30.605 --> 27:32.172
But, yeah, the girls
just left them there

27:32.215 --> 27:36.350
for weeks just like that.

27:36.393 --> 27:39.701
Or maybe they were boys.
Doesn't matter.

27:39.745 --> 27:41.181
Ugh. Can you imagine that?

27:41.224 --> 27:43.139
Like, "Hey, Ma,
what's for dinner?

27:43.183 --> 27:45.838
- Oh, that's right,
your face is blown off."
- No. Dude.

27:45.881 --> 27:49.189
But eventually
the gardener smelled something
and called the police.

27:49.232 --> 27:51.582
Uh, yeah, blood everywhere,
bodies were decaying.

27:51.626 --> 27:54.411
I cannot believe
you have not heard this story.
It's crazy.

27:54.455 --> 27:57.371
You know what?
The important thing is you
swept in and made a killing.

27:57.414 --> 27:59.025
- Well...
- You're cutthroat, Adam.

27:59.068 --> 28:00.940
I like that.

28:00.983 --> 28:05.901
Hey, um, maybe don't
mention anything to Margo.

28:05.945 --> 28:08.208
Wait, Margo doesn't know?

28:08.251 --> 28:09.818
No, I-- I told her.
I told her.

28:09.862 --> 28:12.473
I just said that, like,
an older couple died here

28:12.516 --> 28:14.736
a long time ago,
and that's kinda it.

28:14.780 --> 28:16.433
Yeah, hey, well,
people have to die somewhere.

28:16.477 --> 28:18.000
- Right?
- Thank you.
Yes, I love that.

28:18.044 --> 28:20.394
Hey, I wish someone got
blown away in my house.

28:20.437 --> 28:24.572
- Gives this place
some character.
- Yeah, thanks, man.

28:24.615 --> 28:27.227
You, sir,
scored a piece of pie

28:27.270 --> 28:29.272
in one of the best zips
in the city.

28:29.316 --> 28:32.972
- Margo must be psyched.
- That's just it.

28:33.015 --> 28:34.756
She feels like
moving up here is showing off

28:34.800 --> 28:36.410
and we're in over our heads.

28:36.453 --> 28:38.412
That's the American way.

28:38.455 --> 28:40.327
- Right?
- Yeah.

28:40.370 --> 28:41.763
I mean, somewhere
along the line,

28:41.807 --> 28:44.200
aspirations
became bougie to her.

28:44.244 --> 28:46.986
Or at least mine did.

28:47.029 --> 28:49.205
Like tonight, I invite Neal

28:49.249 --> 28:50.772
and all the founders
of the company,

28:50.816 --> 28:52.556
and she's in the kitchen
hiding the whole night.

28:52.600 --> 28:57.518
Wow. That really chafes me.

28:57.561 --> 29:00.434
- I'm not overreacting?
- Au contraire.

29:00.477 --> 29:01.957
You know, I mean, I can relate.

29:02.001 --> 29:05.395
- Sasha? Yeah.
- God, no.

29:05.439 --> 29:07.746
Sasha is the wind
beneath my wings.

29:07.789 --> 29:10.096
If it wasn't for her,
I wouldn't have had the balls

29:10.139 --> 29:12.533
to launch my first company.

29:12.576 --> 29:14.187
She's my secret weapon.

29:14.230 --> 29:17.233
Wow. Man, must be nice.

29:17.277 --> 29:19.061
Yeah, you know,

29:19.105 --> 29:22.064
sometimes when
one half of the couple

29:22.108 --> 29:26.286
is dissatisfied
with their decisions
or choices,

29:26.329 --> 29:30.856
they don't want the other half
flying too close to the sun.

29:30.899 --> 29:33.293
Totally.
No, I get that. Yeah.

29:33.336 --> 29:35.730
No, don't get me wrong.
I'm not saying that
that's the case here.

29:35.774 --> 29:39.212
But what does, uh, Margo?
Margo do again?

29:39.255 --> 29:42.650
- Margo? Oh, great mom.
Great mom.
- Yeah.

29:42.693 --> 29:45.914
She used to make music,
but now she manages her friend
Teeny's thrift shop.

29:45.958 --> 29:48.264
All right.

29:48.308 --> 29:51.050
What would you do
if you were in my situation?

29:51.093 --> 29:55.097
Honestly?

29:55.141 --> 30:00.233
Get out of town
for a romantic weekend,
just the two of you.

30:00.276 --> 30:02.235
Sit her down to have
a heart-to-heart.

30:04.585 --> 30:06.805
And just kill her.

30:09.895 --> 30:13.942
- Oh, my God.
- Your face on that.

30:13.986 --> 30:16.815
Dude, you are dark.
You're a dark mofo.

30:16.858 --> 30:18.729
I like going there sometimes.

30:18.773 --> 30:21.863
Whoa! Come on.
Come over here.
Let me show you.

30:45.365 --> 30:49.543
Oh, bravo. That was so good.

30:49.586 --> 30:51.458
You are too kind, really.
Too kind.

30:51.501 --> 30:55.505
No, you're--
you're amazing.
You should perform.

30:55.549 --> 30:56.898
I used to have a band.

30:56.942 --> 30:58.291
- You did?
- Yeah.

30:58.334 --> 31:00.249
- Oh!
- It was a long time ago.

31:00.293 --> 31:03.209
I smell a reunion tour.

31:03.252 --> 31:05.167
I do not think
that is possible.

31:05.211 --> 31:09.171
- Why?
- No. Feedlot is dead.

31:09.215 --> 31:12.348
- Wait, you were in Feedlot?
- Shut up.

31:12.392 --> 31:15.612
Oh, my God.
I remember you. I saw you.

31:15.656 --> 31:18.267
Yes, it was you and some,
like, sexy guy

31:18.311 --> 31:21.357
in skinny pants
playing some heavy shit.

31:21.401 --> 31:25.927
I saw you with Beck
at a festival, yeah.

31:25.971 --> 31:28.930
We just opened
with about 30 other bands.

31:28.974 --> 31:31.585
That is so cool
that you actually remember.

31:31.628 --> 31:33.935
Oh, yeah. No, I remember.
It was a really good set.

31:33.979 --> 31:35.937
- I remember dancing.
- Yeah?

31:35.981 --> 31:39.636
You have already
made my night,
that is for sure.

31:39.680 --> 31:41.769
You should play my party.

31:41.812 --> 31:43.510
- Mm-mm.
- Yeah, reunion set.

31:43.553 --> 31:45.294
There's gonna be
industry people there.

31:45.338 --> 31:48.645
You are so sweet, but, no.

31:48.689 --> 31:51.213
Call Mr. Sexypants right now.

31:51.257 --> 31:55.609
I haven't talked to Mr. Sexy--

31:55.652 --> 31:58.351
Sebastian in years.

31:58.394 --> 32:00.788
Aside from being
a prima donna cokehead,

32:00.831 --> 32:02.877
he is also my ex.

32:04.661 --> 32:06.011
Well, he sounds like a blast.

32:06.054 --> 32:08.535
Kind of a sore subject
for Adam.

32:08.578 --> 32:11.146
- Why?
- Well, like you said,

32:11.190 --> 32:15.977
- Sebastian's pretty hot.
- Oh, jeez. Really?

32:16.021 --> 32:17.892
Adam--
come on, Adam needs to...

32:17.936 --> 32:22.462
- What?
- Nothing.

32:22.505 --> 32:23.854
What? What, what?
I can take it.

32:23.898 --> 32:27.249
Adam needs to chill out?
Adam needs to--

32:27.293 --> 32:30.035
He needs to take his boot
off your fucking throat.

32:31.906 --> 32:33.473
That is not okay.

32:33.516 --> 32:36.258
I'm sorry,
if Tom pulled that shit,
I'd break his nose.

32:36.302 --> 32:40.262
- Okay.
- Come on, call him.

32:40.306 --> 32:42.003
- Now?
- Call him.

32:42.047 --> 32:44.832
Oh, my God. No. No, no.

32:44.875 --> 32:46.442
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Call him right now.

32:46.486 --> 32:49.402
I don't even think
that I have his number.

32:49.445 --> 32:51.012
No.

32:53.536 --> 32:54.668
It's-- stop.

32:56.061 --> 32:58.933
- S-E-B...
- Give me that.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.848
- Come on. I am not kidding.
- Bingo.

33:00.891 --> 33:03.590
Give that back. Seriously.

33:03.633 --> 33:05.722
Oh, my God, Sebastian.

33:05.766 --> 33:08.029
- It's ringing.
- What?

33:08.073 --> 33:09.204
- Hello?
- No.

33:09.248 --> 33:10.640
No. Oh, my God.
What the fuck?

33:10.684 --> 33:12.512
- Answer it. Answer it now.
- Hello?

33:12.555 --> 33:14.427
- Say, "What are you wearing"?
- Margs? That you?

33:14.470 --> 33:18.300
Hey. Hi!
Hey, it's-- it's me.

33:18.344 --> 33:23.697
Um, I'm surprised you still
have my number in your phone.

33:23.740 --> 33:26.091
I'm surprised you're calling me
in the middle of the night.

33:26.134 --> 33:29.920
- Oh, my God.
- I am so sorry.
Yeah, um...

33:29.964 --> 33:34.229
Pleasantly surprised.
It's been far too long.

33:34.273 --> 33:36.057
I have to admit,

33:36.101 --> 33:38.494
- I was having some drinks...
- Mm-hmm.

33:38.538 --> 33:42.020
...and I was listening
to some of our old stuff.

33:42.063 --> 33:45.719
- Are you still playing?
- Here and there.

33:45.762 --> 33:49.244
It's good to hear your voice.
Really good.

33:49.288 --> 33:54.075
Is it a-- is it a crazy idea
for us to get together

33:54.119 --> 33:58.601
and maybe tinker around
professionally?

33:58.645 --> 34:01.082
Of course,
I'd really love that.

34:01.126 --> 34:03.693
Professionally.

34:06.609 --> 34:08.568
So, here we go.
Yeah, well, it's still

34:08.611 --> 34:10.352
a work in progress,
but, you know...

34:10.396 --> 34:13.094
Ah, where all
the magic happens.

34:13.138 --> 34:16.489
Ah, this?

34:16.532 --> 34:19.318
- This is perfect.
- Aw, thanks, man.

34:19.361 --> 34:21.363
Hey, should we go find where
the ladies disappeared to?

34:21.407 --> 34:24.801
Oh, let them do their thing.
I can tell they're
becoming fast friends.

34:24.845 --> 34:27.804
Yeah, well, you know,
Margo can be a tough
nut to crack, so...

34:27.848 --> 34:30.807
- Well, Sasha's specialty.
- That's so cool.

34:30.851 --> 34:34.376
- Tonight may get interesting.
- Love it.

34:34.420 --> 34:35.725
What do you mean?

34:35.769 --> 34:38.163
Welcome to the Hills.

34:38.206 --> 34:40.469
We share more than
just cups of sugar.

34:40.513 --> 34:44.386
- Uh...
- You opposed to them having
a little fun together?

34:44.430 --> 34:45.822
Of course, they have to
pay the husband tax.

34:45.866 --> 34:49.348
Right. Uh, what is
the husband tax again?

34:49.391 --> 34:53.003
Uh, you know,
get us in the mix.

34:53.047 --> 34:55.919
Right, no, I-- you know what?
I don't think that we are--

34:55.963 --> 34:58.139
Ah, I get it, I get it.

34:58.183 --> 35:01.142
You want to be the only
meat in the sandwich.
You selfish little prick.

35:01.186 --> 35:03.579
No, that's not what I said.

35:03.623 --> 35:06.060
Yeah, but it's
what you meant, right?

35:06.104 --> 35:11.587
Come on, I saw the way you were
eye-fucking her earlier.

35:11.631 --> 35:14.851
Nope, I wouldn't--
no, I was not
eye-fucking anything.

35:14.895 --> 35:16.157
- Was I?
- Yeah.

35:16.201 --> 35:18.638
- Dude, I am so sorry.
- Ah, busted.

35:18.681 --> 35:21.684
- It's okay.
Have at it, buddy.
- What?

35:21.728 --> 35:26.515
Yeah, my way of saying
welcome to the neighborhood.

35:26.559 --> 35:28.735
Oh.

35:28.778 --> 35:32.042
No, I-- I couldn't do--
wait, like, really?

35:32.086 --> 35:36.612
Yeah!
I'll just, you know, watch.

35:36.656 --> 35:39.180
Well, I'm allowed
at least that, aren't I?

35:39.224 --> 35:41.617
Uh, yeah, if that's
what you would like.

35:41.661 --> 35:43.619
Hey, hey, listen.
As long as you don't
leave any marks,

35:43.663 --> 35:46.013
you can do whatever you want.
Nothing is off-limits.

35:46.056 --> 35:48.058
But whatever you do,
don't hold back.

35:48.102 --> 35:51.410
Sasha is like a bear
when she smells fear.

35:51.453 --> 35:52.933
You and your girl
down for being tied up?

35:52.976 --> 35:57.024
Tied up? I don't know.
Maybe, um-- like, tight?

35:57.067 --> 35:58.634
I'll double check with Sasha.

35:58.678 --> 36:00.375
You get the green light
from Margo.

36:00.419 --> 36:02.072
- Okay, yeah, I mean,
I think we--
- Hey, you.

36:02.116 --> 36:04.945
Hey! Hey, baby!
Here you are.

36:04.988 --> 36:06.512
As we were walking
past Dylan's room,

36:06.555 --> 36:08.731
I saw you-know-who
got out of his cage again.

36:08.775 --> 36:12.126
- Oh, fucking Nibbles.
- We need to look for him.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.476
This stupid hamster gets
out of its cage once a week.

36:14.520 --> 36:16.478
It's either in my shoe,
it's in the hamper,
it's-- you know what?

36:16.522 --> 36:18.915
Don't be a party pooper.
We can look for him later.

36:18.959 --> 36:21.483
- We're having fun, yeah.
- Okay.

36:21.527 --> 36:25.139
- Oh, my God.
- What?

36:25.183 --> 36:27.576
- Wait, what is it?
- Oh, my God, are they--

36:27.620 --> 36:29.143
- What happened?
Everything okay?
- What?

36:29.187 --> 36:31.493
Jesus, is that a strap-on?

36:31.537 --> 36:33.278
- What?
- They're getting kinda rough.

36:33.321 --> 36:36.150
- Which house? Which one?
- Oh, shit, he's strangling her.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.499
- Oh.
- What?

36:37.543 --> 36:40.502
She's not-- she's turning,
like, blue, I think.

36:40.546 --> 36:42.156
- Someone call 9-1-1.
- What?

36:42.200 --> 36:43.723
- Do you have your phone?
- No, I don't have it.

36:43.766 --> 36:45.115
- Do you have a phone on you?
- Oh, yeah.

36:45.159 --> 36:46.726
Oh, my God, they're
still fucking though.

36:46.769 --> 36:48.554
- What? How do you--
- They're still...

36:51.557 --> 36:52.732
- Oh.
- Is it-- is it a joke?

36:52.775 --> 36:56.126
Oh, my God! That was crazy!

36:56.170 --> 36:57.693
- I thought it was real.
- That was good.

36:57.737 --> 37:00.261
You better not use these
to peep on us, you perverts.

37:00.305 --> 37:01.697
- No! No.
- No, my-- no, we'd never.

37:01.741 --> 37:03.003
At least not without
telling us first.

37:03.046 --> 37:05.048
- Right.
- Right, yeah.

37:05.092 --> 37:08.269
Time for another round?

37:08.313 --> 37:09.357
- Yeah!
- Let's do it.

37:09.401 --> 37:10.663
All right, let's go.

37:10.706 --> 37:12.012
Oh, my God.
That was crazy.

37:12.055 --> 37:13.796
- Did you fall for it?
- I did.

37:13.840 --> 37:15.798
I was like, "What the--
and they're still fucking?"

37:15.842 --> 37:18.714
- I didn't know.
- Oh, my...

38:33.311 --> 38:34.877
Thank goodness.

38:41.449 --> 38:42.885
Damn it.

40:18.372 --> 40:20.200
Okay.

40:32.821 --> 40:34.475
And so when you guys met,
you just knew.

40:34.519 --> 40:36.695
- Yeah. Yeah.
- You knew? We were like that.

40:36.738 --> 40:40.699
- Yeah.
- Hey, hey, look at these gals
getting all warm and cozy.

40:40.742 --> 40:42.135
I love it.
Love to see it.

40:42.178 --> 40:46.487
So, um, I found a band
for our party.

40:46.531 --> 40:48.924
- Oh, nice.
- I don't know if now
is the best--

40:48.968 --> 40:50.926
The grand reunion of,
drumroll, please...

40:50.970 --> 40:53.102
Oh.

40:53.146 --> 40:56.715
- Feedlot.
- Nice.

40:56.758 --> 41:00.109
- This sounds cool.
- That sounds very, very cool.

41:00.153 --> 41:02.851
Gonna be a weird reunion
without what's his butt.

41:02.895 --> 41:07.334
Well, I called him.
Don't get weird.

41:07.377 --> 41:09.510
What do you mean,
you called him?

41:09.554 --> 41:12.861
It was 10 years ago.
You can't still be jealous.

41:12.905 --> 41:15.124
I'm definitely not jealous.

41:15.168 --> 41:17.910
I'm just wondering--
like, you just called him
out of the blue?

41:17.953 --> 41:22.871
- "Hey."
- Yeah, he as up
and totally game.

41:22.915 --> 41:25.004
Of course he was game.
He probably thought
it was a booty call.

41:25.047 --> 41:27.615
This guy is the king
of the assholes, by the way.

41:27.659 --> 41:31.227
- I've done a lot
to spare your feelings.
- Mm-hmm.

41:31.271 --> 41:32.968
- Why can't I do something?
- You've done a lot?

41:33.012 --> 41:34.230
Margo, where's
this coming from?

41:34.274 --> 41:35.754
I don't think
it's a lot to ask

41:35.797 --> 41:37.407
for you to be
a little supportive.

41:37.451 --> 41:40.585
- Mm.
- Me?

41:40.628 --> 41:42.195
- Yeah.
- Me?

41:42.238 --> 41:43.588
Do you know how important
tonight was for me?

41:43.631 --> 41:45.981
Yeah, yeah.
#AdamAndMargosCrib.

41:46.025 --> 41:49.724
- I got it.
- Did you even talk to Neal
or his wife at all?

41:49.768 --> 41:53.293
- Did you even try?
- Yeah, Neal fucking sucks.

41:53.336 --> 41:54.990
Neal's the kind of guy
who says,

41:55.034 --> 41:57.166
"I'd hug you but I don't want
to get in trouble,"

41:57.210 --> 41:58.777
every time you see him.

41:58.820 --> 42:00.953
Yeah, he's a little old-school,
I'll give you that,

42:00.996 --> 42:03.216
but you can't stomach
my boss for two minutes?

42:03.259 --> 42:05.479
No, it's you around him
that I can't stomach.

42:05.523 --> 42:09.483
You act like such
a fucking kiss-ass,

42:09.527 --> 42:12.530
and it grosses me
the fuck out.

42:15.358 --> 42:16.403
Wow.

42:20.886 --> 42:22.409
I'm so sorry.

42:22.452 --> 42:23.715
- No don't apologize.
- No, let it out.

42:23.758 --> 42:26.631
- I-- no.
- Put it all on the table.

42:26.674 --> 42:29.416
Guys, it's fine.
It's all right.
We're not fighters, so--

42:29.459 --> 42:31.505
- No, we're not.
- Maybe that's the problem.

42:31.549 --> 42:34.029
Sasha and I have
this technique we like to use

42:34.073 --> 42:35.422
to help resolve arguments.

42:35.465 --> 42:36.771
We learned it
at a retreat in Norway.

42:36.815 --> 42:38.468
Actually, can...

42:40.862 --> 42:43.822
- It's good.
- So, uh, yeah, stand up.

42:43.865 --> 42:44.823
- Drink down.
- Okay.

42:44.866 --> 42:48.391
Um, don't judge it,

42:48.435 --> 42:51.481
but you're both
going to take turns

42:51.525 --> 42:53.614
hitting each other
on the shoulder.

42:53.658 --> 42:56.835
- That's it?
- Yeah.

42:56.878 --> 43:00.490
- Oh. Uh, the punching game?
- No.

43:00.534 --> 43:02.754
No, there's
a therapeutic term for it.

43:02.797 --> 43:05.278
It's something in German.
It's on the tip of my tongue.

43:05.321 --> 43:08.020
The punching game.
Yeah, played that
in middle school,

43:08.063 --> 43:10.326
- like, a lot.
- No, it's actually
from the same school

43:10.370 --> 43:12.546
as primal scream therapy,
if you guys have heard of it.

43:12.590 --> 43:14.592
- Or...
- Okay, hate to say this
to you guys,

43:14.635 --> 43:17.159
but I think you should
get your money back
from that retreat.

43:17.203 --> 43:18.770
We're not gonna--
we're not gonna play that game.

43:18.813 --> 43:22.164
Why not?

43:22.208 --> 43:25.124
Why not? Oh, because
it's ridiculous, for one.

43:25.167 --> 43:28.562
And, oh, I don't know,
kind of like domestic abuse
or something like that.

43:28.606 --> 43:31.391
- I could seriously hurt you.
- Mm-hmm.

43:31.434 --> 43:33.132
Good girl.

43:33.175 --> 43:36.004
- Yes.
- Okay.

43:36.048 --> 43:39.138
- I actually feel better.
- Yeah.

43:39.181 --> 43:40.922
- Yeah, you do.
- Good, good.

43:40.966 --> 43:42.271
I'm so happy for you.
That's great.

43:42.315 --> 43:43.708
Now you. You do her.

43:43.751 --> 43:45.579
- It's your turn.
- Yeah, yeah, come on.

43:45.623 --> 43:48.930
- Seriously?
- Do me, Adam.

43:48.974 --> 43:53.108
Guys, this is literally
the dumbest thing-- okay.

43:53.152 --> 43:55.458
Here comes. You ready?

44:01.334 --> 44:04.511
- Ow, what the fuck?
- What? Did I do it wrong?

44:04.554 --> 44:05.773
- No, that was perfect.
- No, that was...

44:05.817 --> 44:06.992
That was good.
It was the best one.

44:07.035 --> 44:08.254
No, that was great.

44:08.297 --> 44:09.908
You actually hit me
and I joke hit you.

44:09.951 --> 44:11.910
Yeah, and that's your problem.

44:11.953 --> 44:13.912
You know what?
You gotta make it count
to make it work.

44:13.955 --> 44:15.827
- Yeah.
- Guys, why are we doing this?

44:15.870 --> 44:19.395
Okay, it's because
Adam has never been
in a fight in his life.

44:19.439 --> 44:22.224
- Don't-- can you not?
- There was this one time
where this guy

44:22.268 --> 44:24.226
spilled a whole bucket
of buttered popcorn on us

44:24.270 --> 44:28.753
at the movies
and blamed it on Adam,
called him a dipshit,

44:28.796 --> 44:30.929
and Adam didn't
do one fucking thing.

44:30.972 --> 44:33.714
Oh, fuck! God damn it.

44:33.758 --> 44:35.194
You know what?
I'm done, I'm done.

44:35.237 --> 44:36.848
I won.

44:36.891 --> 44:39.198
Well, you didn't win.

44:39.241 --> 44:41.069
Technically, she does win
because you called "uncle."

44:41.113 --> 44:43.289
Yeah, so you lost.
You're the worst.

44:43.332 --> 44:45.639
No, no, no. No.

44:45.683 --> 44:47.989
I could play this game
all night long, okay?

44:48.033 --> 44:51.123
But I'm choosing not to
because it's not fun
or therapeutic.

44:51.166 --> 44:52.907
- Because--
- I'm putting my foot down.

44:52.951 --> 44:54.735
Oh, yeah, you put
your foot down.
Thank you so much.

44:54.779 --> 44:57.520
Yeah, you still lost
'cause I won.

44:57.564 --> 45:01.394
You didn't--
okay, you know what?

45:01.437 --> 45:03.831
- You wanna do it?
Let's do it.
- Yeah.

45:03.875 --> 45:06.486
Please-- please
don't cry to me tomorrow

45:06.529 --> 45:07.748
when you have a big fat
fucking bruise, okay?

45:07.792 --> 45:10.142
Oh, don't hurt yourself,
slugger.

45:10.185 --> 45:12.840
Here we go, buddy.
Big daddy's up to bat.

45:12.884 --> 45:15.843
And he's angry.

45:15.887 --> 45:18.803
Ow, fuck!
God damn it. You moved!

45:18.846 --> 45:20.239
Of course I moved!

45:20.282 --> 45:22.023
You were aiming
for my fucking face?

45:22.067 --> 45:23.851
What? No, I wasn't.

45:23.895 --> 45:25.026
I slipped a little bit,
all right?

45:25.070 --> 45:26.462
I was faking you out.

45:26.506 --> 45:28.116
Like I would actually
hit my wife.

45:28.160 --> 45:30.118
Yeah, I didn't think that
until ten seconds ago.

45:30.162 --> 45:32.599
God damn it.
Great, now I'm bleeding.

45:32.642 --> 45:35.863
Oh, God, it's supposed to end
with you problem-solving

45:35.907 --> 45:37.430
with your partner on how to
minimize each other's pain.

45:37.473 --> 45:39.475
Although I do feel like
there might've been

45:39.519 --> 45:41.477
some potentially
major breakthroughs.

45:41.521 --> 45:43.697
- I do, too.
- Oh, God, I just--

45:43.741 --> 45:45.699
I hate the sight of blood.

45:45.743 --> 45:47.832
- Yeah, well, it's mine.
- Okay, I'm just--

45:47.875 --> 45:50.051
I'm gonna need a sip
before I bandage you up.

45:50.095 --> 45:51.836
- Thanks.
- Fuck.

45:51.879 --> 45:53.446
- Yeah.
- Gosh damn it.

45:53.489 --> 45:55.796
Oh, my God.

45:58.320 --> 46:00.845
Is that Nibbles?

46:00.888 --> 46:03.499
- How the fuck did get--
- Oh, my God!

46:03.543 --> 46:05.501
He was in my fucking mouth!

46:05.545 --> 46:07.721
- It's all right.
- What the fuck?

46:07.765 --> 46:09.854
Poor little fella
must've gotten thirsty.

46:14.032 --> 46:17.775
- Oh, my God.
- That was Dylan's hamster?

46:17.818 --> 46:21.561
- Was, yeah.
- Uh-oh.

46:21.604 --> 46:24.782
- Hey, you all right?
- Do not fucking touch me!

46:28.960 --> 46:30.918
Ow.

46:30.962 --> 46:32.528
Can you be careful, please?

46:34.530 --> 46:37.011
He was in my mouth.

46:38.186 --> 46:40.275
Dylan is gonna be devastated.

46:40.319 --> 46:41.799
Well, I told you
he wasn't ready for a pet.

46:41.842 --> 46:44.845
I told you we needed
to look for him.

46:44.889 --> 46:46.542
I said we should get a turtle.
You remember that?

46:46.586 --> 46:48.153
So it would outlive us all.

46:48.196 --> 46:49.763
A dead hamster was in my mouth.
Do you remember that?

46:49.807 --> 46:52.070
Yeah, it was really gross.

46:53.375 --> 46:54.768
Ow, damn. Just-- God!

46:54.812 --> 46:57.727
Look, don't be such
a goddamn baby.

47:05.605 --> 47:06.693
Ah!

47:07.912 --> 47:09.478
You got it, babe.

47:13.743 --> 47:16.224
Hey, how's the paw,
Raging Bull?

47:16.268 --> 47:18.226
You know,
I have a private doctor
if you need one.

47:18.270 --> 47:19.662
He does house visits
if we need him to.

47:19.706 --> 47:21.664
Aw, no,
it's actually not that bad.

47:21.708 --> 47:23.623
- I'm good. Thank you.
- Well, we just tidied up
a little bit

47:23.666 --> 47:25.625
and kinda freshened up
everyone's drinks

47:25.668 --> 47:27.148
'cause we figured
you'd need it after that.

47:27.192 --> 47:29.977
Oh, you know what?
Honestly, I'm beat.

47:30.021 --> 47:31.674
I think I'm close
to my limit, so...

47:31.718 --> 47:33.851
Yeah, we don't need
anymore injuries tonight.

47:33.894 --> 47:35.243
- Yeah.
- Amen to that.

47:35.287 --> 47:36.636
Hey, well, the bright side is

47:36.679 --> 47:37.855
you guys have
a very colorful story

47:37.898 --> 47:39.552
to tell at your next party.

47:39.595 --> 47:42.424
- Oof, that is for sure.
- The important thing

47:42.468 --> 47:44.862
is not to let what happened
ruin our nice evening.

47:44.905 --> 47:46.646
Nibbles wouldn't
have wanted that.

47:46.689 --> 47:49.214
Yeah, in fact,
let's put our heads together

47:49.257 --> 47:51.738
and think of a creative way
to relieve some of this tension.

47:51.781 --> 47:56.047
You know, lift the cloud,
get some endorphins pumping.

47:58.353 --> 48:02.009
- What do you mean?
- I mean there's
strength in numbers.

48:02.053 --> 48:03.706
I mean, what better way
to get out of aggression?

48:03.750 --> 48:05.795
Sasha and I
always find it cathartic.

48:05.839 --> 48:07.493
Yeah, highly cathartic.

48:07.536 --> 48:08.494
Plus, whiskey makes me,

48:08.537 --> 48:12.498
um, well, horny.

48:12.541 --> 48:14.413
Oh.

48:18.069 --> 48:20.636
- What is he talking about?
- Hmm? Uh...

48:20.680 --> 48:22.812
Oh, I thought--
you didn't tell her
in the bathroom?

48:25.076 --> 48:27.774
- Sorry.
- Uh-oh.

48:28.949 --> 48:30.037
What's everyone talking about?

48:30.081 --> 48:31.473
Nothing. Nothing.

48:31.517 --> 48:33.954
Exactly. Nothing, nada.

48:33.998 --> 48:36.174
- Adam?
- Adam?

48:36.217 --> 48:38.263
Adam.

48:38.306 --> 48:41.266
Yeah, we were just talking about
having, like, a little, um--

48:41.309 --> 48:45.183
- like, a sex thing.
- With who?

48:45.226 --> 48:47.185
- When?
- No, no, no.

48:47.228 --> 48:50.492
No, this was just silly,
dumb guy talk, okay?

48:50.536 --> 48:52.103
- This was not--
- Oh, like a foursome?

48:52.146 --> 48:53.974
No. God, no. No.

48:54.018 --> 48:57.847
Like, a threesome,
but Tom was gonna watch.

48:57.891 --> 49:00.676
- Ew.
- Well, I'm playing it by ear.

49:00.720 --> 49:03.375
- I may tag in at some point.
- I love it when you tag in.

49:03.418 --> 49:07.118
- I know you do, baby.
- This is bullshit.

49:07.161 --> 49:11.992
I think that we all just need
something to soak up
the alcohol with.

49:12.036 --> 49:13.211
Yeah, I think we got some
finger foods left over.

49:13.254 --> 49:14.560
I'm gonna go help out
with that.

49:14.603 --> 49:16.301
Excuse me. Hey.

49:17.824 --> 49:19.782
Huh.

49:25.614 --> 49:27.268
A foursome? Really?

49:27.312 --> 49:29.967
No. Threesome, okay?

49:30.010 --> 49:31.838
And I was just hearing him out.

49:31.881 --> 49:35.537
Okay, I didn't want Tom to,
like, think I was lame.

49:35.581 --> 49:37.626
Oh, my God, Adam,
listen to yourself.

49:37.670 --> 49:41.239
Trust me, I do not want to be
one of those sexy type
swinger couples.

49:41.282 --> 49:43.632
- I don't.
- And I don't wanna be one of
those couples that fights

49:43.676 --> 49:45.547
- in front of other
couples either.
No.

49:45.591 --> 49:47.854
- Those couples are the worst.
- Yes.

49:47.897 --> 49:49.160
We're not one of
those couples. Thank you.
- No, definitely not.

49:50.944 --> 49:52.554
I'm really sorry, okay?

49:52.598 --> 49:54.687
I should've looked
for the hamster,

49:54.730 --> 49:57.646
and I was just--
I was being a little bitch.

49:57.690 --> 50:01.389
No, I was pushing your buttons,
and you are a little bitch.

50:01.433 --> 50:03.043
Yeah.

50:03.087 --> 50:07.308
I love you
even when you are an asshole.

50:07.352 --> 50:12.052
And I love you even when
I'm being an asshole.

50:15.403 --> 50:17.623
- It's been a long night.
- Yeah.

50:17.666 --> 50:19.973
I think we're both
a little drunk.

50:20.017 --> 50:21.322
- Little bit.
- And tired.

50:21.366 --> 50:24.064
- And in my case high.
- Hey!

50:24.108 --> 50:25.979
Everything okay
in there, lovebirds?

50:26.023 --> 50:28.547
Hey, let me know
if you need a referee.

50:28.590 --> 50:31.028
Uh, yeah.
No, everything's good!
Thank you!

50:31.071 --> 50:34.335
Oh, wow. Hey, look at all
your old school board games.

50:34.379 --> 50:38.687
- Who's down for some trivia?
- Tom and Sasha are great.

50:38.731 --> 50:40.733
Oh, they're so great.
Love them.

50:40.776 --> 50:42.082
But can't we just go to bed?

50:42.126 --> 50:43.431
I was thinking
the exact same thing.

50:43.475 --> 50:46.478
Thank you.
They have so much energy.

50:46.521 --> 50:47.566
I haven't been up this late
in ten years.

50:47.609 --> 50:48.828
No.

50:48.871 --> 50:49.872
Can we just tell them
we're tired?

50:49.916 --> 50:51.961
Yes, definitely.

50:52.005 --> 50:53.006
We're not gonna
seem lame, right?

50:53.050 --> 50:56.140
Doesn't matter. Who cares?

50:59.882 --> 51:02.363
Nothing about this
looks familiar.

51:04.235 --> 51:08.108
Yeah, that is not it.

51:08.152 --> 51:10.632
Fuck.

51:10.676 --> 51:14.158
Which way, which way, which way?

51:20.033 --> 51:21.861
Frank?

51:21.904 --> 51:23.428
Oh, my God. Come on.

51:23.471 --> 51:25.430
Hello? Hello?

51:26.692 --> 51:28.433
This is stupid.

51:37.833 --> 51:40.923
This fucking reception.

52:09.387 --> 52:10.562
Hey.

52:12.912 --> 52:15.436
There they are.
Now where were we?

52:15.480 --> 52:17.090
God. Oh, Outburst.

52:17.134 --> 52:19.092
Yeah, I haven't played
this game in years.

52:19.136 --> 52:20.659
It's such a throwback.

52:20.702 --> 52:23.227
Uh, so we were just talking,
and, um, oof,

52:23.270 --> 52:24.924
looks like it's time
to hit the old hay.

52:24.967 --> 52:28.884
Yeah. I was saying,
I haven't been up
this late in ages.

52:28.928 --> 52:31.104
- Yeah.
- Oh, really?
Is it that late?

52:31.148 --> 52:33.454
Mm. We get it.
We can take a hint.

52:33.498 --> 52:34.977
You guys want some more blow.
Sasha?

52:35.021 --> 52:36.065
Oh, yeah. I have more.

52:36.109 --> 52:37.893
Oh, no. No, no, no.

52:37.937 --> 52:41.114
That is okay. Yeah.
We really are just pooped.

52:41.158 --> 52:42.898
Yeah, maybe just a little
out of practice, you know?

52:42.942 --> 52:45.901
- I'm beat on my feet.
- Totally. We should get going.

52:45.945 --> 52:47.990
- Yeah.
- Last call it is.

52:48.034 --> 52:50.254
Obviously, you guys mean after
we finish our drinks, right?

52:50.297 --> 52:52.256
Of course.
They're not savages.

52:52.299 --> 52:54.823
Yeah, bad luck to leave
a house with a full drink.

52:54.867 --> 52:57.435
- Well, actually--
- What happened to
the finger foods?

52:57.478 --> 52:59.437
Yeah, totally.
I could nibble on something.

53:00.960 --> 53:03.528
- Rest in peace.
- Those glazed dates.

53:03.571 --> 53:05.269
- And the scallop wraps.
- The pizza.

53:05.312 --> 53:08.402
- We didn't have any pizza.
- Are you sure?

53:08.446 --> 53:10.970
Then we should order some.
Do you guys know Primos?

53:11.013 --> 53:14.016
- Mmm, Primos!
We love Primos.
- Yeah.

53:14.060 --> 53:15.757
You guys will love Primos.
They're on Uber Eats.

53:15.801 --> 53:18.064
Look, I know we've all had
a lot to drink tonight, so...

53:18.107 --> 53:20.109
You guys might've,
but we're still catching up.

53:20.153 --> 53:21.546
Mm-hmm. Is everyone good

53:21.589 --> 53:23.287
with a large half cheese,
half sausage?

53:23.330 --> 53:24.810
- Good for me.
- Tom.

53:24.853 --> 53:27.334
- What, pepperoni?
- We're going to bed.

53:27.378 --> 53:29.075
I think it's time
for everyone to go.

53:29.118 --> 53:31.208
Trust me, buddy,
you're gonna want
something in your belly.

53:31.251 --> 53:32.948
You're gonna appreciate it
in the morning.

53:32.992 --> 53:36.213
Okay, well, we really
just wanna go to bed.

53:36.256 --> 53:38.040
- Alone.
- Yeah.

53:42.393 --> 53:44.656
I think there are sour grapes
about the sex stuff.

53:44.699 --> 53:48.529
Agree. I think we're all a
little frustrated right now.

53:48.573 --> 53:52.316
Do you guys think
that you're taking out your
lack of communication on us?

53:52.359 --> 53:56.189
What? No.
We communicate just fine,
thank you.

53:56.233 --> 53:58.191
- I'm not too sure about that.
- Really?

53:58.235 --> 53:59.671
Is that why your wife
doesn't know

53:59.714 --> 54:02.021
why you got such
a sweet deal on this house?

54:03.240 --> 54:06.721
What deal? On this house?

54:06.765 --> 54:10.072
Does this have something to do
with the couple that died here?

54:10.116 --> 54:12.074
Yeah, maybe just
a little bit more than that.

54:12.118 --> 54:14.076
You know,
it was so long ago, okay?

54:14.120 --> 54:15.643
But every house has a story,

54:15.687 --> 54:17.297
and I just didn't want you
to have nightmares.

54:17.341 --> 54:19.299
Well, now you have to tell me.

54:20.648 --> 54:22.868
- What happened?
- Me and my big mouth.

54:22.911 --> 54:26.045
Strike two.
I'm just gonna
stay out of this one.

54:26.088 --> 54:30.615
It was just a little
domestic murder situation.

54:30.658 --> 54:32.051
- What?
- It wasn't, like,

54:32.094 --> 54:33.618
a home invasion
or anything, okay?

54:33.661 --> 54:34.836
It was an inside job.

54:34.880 --> 54:36.403
This very unhappy couple

54:36.447 --> 54:39.058
committed sort of
a double homicide

54:39.101 --> 54:40.538
- in front of their kids.
- What?

54:43.062 --> 54:44.846
But the whole house
has been redone.

54:44.890 --> 54:47.066
New fixtures, everything.

54:47.109 --> 54:49.416
Okay? This happened
so, so long ago.

54:49.460 --> 54:51.244
Yeah,
it wasn't that long ago.

54:51.288 --> 54:53.028
Dude, why do you have
to exacerbate everything?

54:53.072 --> 54:56.249
Is this why I feel like people
drive by the house sometimes?

54:56.293 --> 54:58.382
Like, I feel like
I'm being watched?

54:58.425 --> 54:59.905
Like, this is a murder house?

54:59.948 --> 55:02.342
Oh, relax, it's not like
it's the Manson house.

55:02.386 --> 55:04.866
- But how cool would that be?
- That would be amazing.
I would die.

55:04.910 --> 55:08.435
I mean, big whoop, okay?
I hadn't even heard
about it before tonight.

55:08.479 --> 55:11.090
- You hadn't? Oh, I had.
- Mm-mm.

55:11.133 --> 55:13.310
Yeah, the creepy part is
that the police said the bodies

55:13.353 --> 55:15.442
were, like, tampered with.

55:15.486 --> 55:17.401
Hold it. What?

55:17.444 --> 55:20.099
Yeah, you have to deep dive
into blogs for that info

55:20.142 --> 55:22.449
'cause it's way too disturbing
for family newspapers.

55:22.493 --> 55:25.104
- I love murder stuff.
- What do you mean
tampered with?

55:25.147 --> 55:27.672
- Oh, God, I don't wanna know.
- Nope, she's right.

55:27.715 --> 55:28.890
I don't wanna know either.
Never mind.

55:28.934 --> 55:31.110
No, tampered with, like--

55:31.153 --> 55:32.851
like, altered or,
like, fiddled with.

55:32.894 --> 55:33.895
Like, fucked with.

55:37.072 --> 55:38.900
- By the kids?
- Yeah.

55:38.944 --> 55:40.902
- Ew.
- I think the exact word

55:40.946 --> 55:43.905
they used was "defiled,"
but I can send you guys a link

55:43.949 --> 55:46.865
- if you want to read
more about it.
No.

55:46.908 --> 55:51.304
- I cannot hear
any more about this.
I understand.

55:51.348 --> 55:53.088
- No wonder Dylan
is having nightmares.
- I know.

55:53.132 --> 55:55.090
Yeah, we'll discuss
this later. Yeah.

55:55.134 --> 55:59.617
- Uh, you two need to go.
- Now.

55:59.660 --> 56:02.968
You see what he's doing here?

56:03.011 --> 56:04.622
He's changing the subject.

56:04.665 --> 56:07.102
That's clever,
but I hate when you do that.

56:07.146 --> 56:08.974
You know what?
I'm too afraid
to go outside right now.

56:09.017 --> 56:11.585
Sasha, hold me.

56:16.242 --> 56:18.940
Okay, we're calling the police.

56:24.555 --> 56:25.730
What?

56:27.035 --> 56:30.038
- Shit.
- Adam, don't be a wet blanket.

56:30.082 --> 56:32.171
It's your own fault for making
such a good cocktail.

56:32.214 --> 56:34.826
- So good.
- Margo, let me see your phone.

56:34.869 --> 56:37.959
Um, where the hell is it?

56:38.003 --> 56:41.963
I think you had it last
in the garage when
we called Mr. Skinny Pants.

56:42.007 --> 56:44.749
- I'm sure you'll find it
in the morning.
- And no landline?

56:44.792 --> 56:46.533
You know, it's crazy
how dependent all of us are

56:46.577 --> 56:48.361
- on technology these days.
- Yeah.

56:48.405 --> 56:49.971
Enough joking around.

56:50.015 --> 56:52.147
I'm giving you guys
to the count of ten

56:52.191 --> 56:53.671
to walk out that door.

56:53.714 --> 56:56.543
Whoa! What is this,
the wild west?

56:56.587 --> 56:58.893
Ten.

56:58.937 --> 57:00.982
Oh, my God. He's serious.

57:01.026 --> 57:02.114
Do you understand
what's happening here?

57:02.157 --> 57:03.942
- 'Cause I don't.
- Nine.

57:03.985 --> 57:05.857
- Adam.
- Are we being unreasonable?

57:05.900 --> 57:07.815
I think he just
really doesn't want us
to finish our drinks.

57:07.859 --> 57:10.731
- Yeah.
- Eight, seven.

57:10.775 --> 57:14.474
See, the thing
about ultimatums, Adam,

57:14.518 --> 57:16.781
is you never wanna make one
unless you have a plan.

57:16.824 --> 57:19.218
That's negotiating 101.

57:19.261 --> 57:22.047
Otherwise you back yourself up
into a corner,

57:22.090 --> 57:23.701
and that's
when bad things happen.

57:25.398 --> 57:26.660
Six.

57:26.704 --> 57:28.836
Right over here, guys.

57:28.880 --> 57:30.838
- Come on.
- Wow.

57:30.882 --> 57:32.492
Out you go.

57:32.536 --> 57:35.495
Is this how you treat
your new golf partner?

57:35.539 --> 57:37.802
Finally showing
your true colors, Adam.

57:37.845 --> 57:40.457
You know, I don't think
I'll be scheduling drinks

57:40.500 --> 57:43.460
with my business contacts now,
that's for sure.

57:43.503 --> 57:46.854
Tom, I'm sad.
I thought we had some
fun new neighbors.

57:46.898 --> 57:50.336
You know, Margo,
maybe it's best you don't play
our party after all.

57:53.818 --> 57:56.516
- Six.
- You said that already.

57:56.560 --> 57:58.605
I mean, five.

57:58.649 --> 58:01.086
Maybe just let them finish
their goddamn drinks.

58:01.129 --> 58:04.045
- The suspense is killing me.
- I know. Tell me about it.

58:04.089 --> 58:05.133
Four.

58:07.222 --> 58:08.441
Rutabaga.

58:10.748 --> 58:12.967
Well, I'm nothing
if not a man of my word.

58:13.011 --> 58:14.795
- We are done with our--
- Three.

58:14.839 --> 58:17.711
- Oh, my God!
- Fuck.

58:17.755 --> 58:19.887
Jesus. Tom, are you okay?

58:19.931 --> 58:22.324
We had three more seconds, Adam.

58:22.368 --> 58:26.503
We put our drinks down.
He said we were gonna go.

58:26.546 --> 58:28.635
You're gonna go?
Then why don't you go now?

58:28.679 --> 58:30.289
You know why?
'Cause I'll do it again.

58:30.332 --> 58:31.638
I'll knock
your fucking teeth out.

58:31.682 --> 58:33.466
I know you're not the neighbors.

58:38.471 --> 58:40.560
I fucking hate the Hills.

58:40.604 --> 58:43.128
How did I even get this lost?

58:44.956 --> 58:47.088
I don't even know why

58:47.132 --> 58:49.351
the car's beeping at me.

58:49.395 --> 58:51.005
I didn't do anything!

58:51.049 --> 58:54.052
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

58:54.095 --> 58:56.228
Right here.

58:58.970 --> 59:01.320
"We realize you're new,
but this is a quiet
neighborhood.

59:01.363 --> 59:02.495
Please keep the noise down.

59:02.539 --> 59:03.975
Next time,
we will call the police."

59:04.018 --> 59:06.020
Mm-hmm.
Read the letterhead.

59:06.064 --> 59:08.632
- Bob and Annie Talbot.
- Mm-hmm.

59:08.675 --> 59:11.635
855 Kodak Drive.

59:11.678 --> 59:13.724
- Okay.
- We know you're not
the fucking neighbors,

59:13.767 --> 59:16.814
- so who the fuck are you?
- We don't care.

59:16.857 --> 59:19.164
We just need you
to leave right now.

59:19.207 --> 59:21.166
- There's been a mistake.
- I don't wanna hear it.

59:21.209 --> 59:23.560
- We're the other neighbors.
- What?

59:23.603 --> 59:25.083
Just down the street.

59:25.126 --> 59:27.172
- Bullshit. Bullshit.
- No.

59:27.215 --> 59:29.566
No, you said
you lived next door,

59:29.609 --> 59:31.263
and I pointed
in that direction,
and you did too.

59:31.306 --> 59:33.091
Next door is
an expression, Margo.

59:33.134 --> 59:35.746
I said the big mid-century,
right?

59:35.789 --> 59:39.401
- I said the beautiful house.
- Our house is beautiful,

59:39.445 --> 59:40.968
and technically
it is mid-century,

59:41.012 --> 59:42.927
but it's also California ranch.

59:42.970 --> 59:44.537
They have been gaslighting us
all night.

59:44.581 --> 59:47.540
Yeah, what's
the house number, guys, huh?

59:47.584 --> 59:50.717
For Christ's sakes,
we're not gonna be
grilled about this.

59:50.761 --> 59:53.198
You wanna beat us to death?
Have at it.

59:57.115 --> 59:58.464
859.

59:59.770 --> 1:00:01.510
Go check it out.

1:00:05.950 --> 1:00:09.518
859, black door.

1:00:10.519 --> 1:00:12.826
Wind chimes.

1:00:12.870 --> 1:00:14.611
You happy?

1:00:21.400 --> 1:00:23.402
- My God.
- I know.

1:00:24.882 --> 1:00:26.448
It checks out.
What?

1:00:26.492 --> 1:00:28.233
It checks out.

1:00:32.324 --> 1:00:34.065
Oh, my God, um...

1:00:35.719 --> 1:00:39.897
I don't even know what to say.
I'm so sorry.

1:00:39.940 --> 1:00:41.594
Oh, my God.

1:00:41.638 --> 1:00:43.335
You guys,
it's been such a long night.

1:00:43.378 --> 1:00:46.686
And I honestly feel,
like, a little cokey still.

1:00:46.730 --> 1:00:48.732
Yeah, how's your head, man?

1:00:48.775 --> 1:00:50.603
Do you need a little
something for that?

1:00:50.647 --> 1:00:55.129
It's not too bad.
I mean, we got lucky.
I just need to clean it.

1:00:55.173 --> 1:00:57.654
I'm so sorry, but why the hell
didn't you guys just leave?

1:00:57.697 --> 1:01:00.395
We were just goofing off.

1:01:00.439 --> 1:01:02.746
I didn't realize
I was gonna be attacked.

1:01:02.789 --> 1:01:06.053
- I guess we may have
taken it a little too far.
- It's a game we play.

1:01:06.097 --> 1:01:09.056
It's like
a little initiation
into the neighborhood.

1:01:09.100 --> 1:01:11.929
Yeah, to see if
we can get the new neighbors
to stay up till dawn.

1:01:11.972 --> 1:01:14.061
The Talbots did it to us
when we moved in.

1:01:14.105 --> 1:01:17.499
- Why didn't you just say that?
- Well, what fun is that?

1:01:17.543 --> 1:01:20.633
Tom, I'm really, really sorry
about the whole bottle thing.

1:01:20.677 --> 1:01:21.678
You should be.

1:01:23.331 --> 1:01:25.551
One more drink
and we'll call it even.

1:01:31.122 --> 1:01:32.993
- Kidding.
- Oh.

1:01:33.037 --> 1:01:35.735
Right, of course. Yeah.

1:01:41.088 --> 1:01:42.611
Well?

1:01:44.135 --> 1:01:45.702
Rutabaga.

1:01:52.447 --> 1:01:54.841
Hey, thanks again for--

1:01:54.885 --> 1:01:56.451
for just such a crazy night,
you know.

1:01:56.495 --> 1:02:01.369
And, um, we, uh...

1:02:01.413 --> 1:02:04.503
Oh, man. Heh.

1:02:04.546 --> 1:02:07.071
Just, we really
like you guys, so...

1:02:08.507 --> 1:02:10.727
We like you guys, too.

1:02:10.770 --> 1:02:13.294
If we didn't, you'd know.

1:02:15.949 --> 1:02:19.779
- All right.
- Good night.

1:02:19.823 --> 1:02:21.085
Oh, man.

1:02:28.048 --> 1:02:30.268
- Let's just make sure
they get in.
- Oh, yeah.

1:02:38.842 --> 1:02:41.148
Is that a mid-century?

1:02:41.192 --> 1:02:43.281
It's a California ranch.

1:02:43.324 --> 1:02:44.761
Mid-century adjacent.

1:02:44.804 --> 1:02:46.806
Right.

1:02:53.857 --> 1:02:55.989
Are they having trouble
with their key?

1:03:07.218 --> 1:03:08.654
It looks like they're in.

1:03:09.873 --> 1:03:11.222
All right.

1:03:17.881 --> 1:03:20.057
Did we just make
total assholes of ourselves?

1:03:20.100 --> 1:03:22.711
No?

1:03:22.755 --> 1:03:25.714
I don't know. Maybe.

1:03:25.758 --> 1:03:27.804
I mean, they were being
super fun and friendly

1:03:27.847 --> 1:03:29.936
and I smashed a bottle
on his head.

1:03:29.980 --> 1:03:31.808
- That is true.
- Yeah, so,

1:03:31.851 --> 1:03:33.374
I was a total asshole.

1:03:33.418 --> 1:03:35.986
Great. Well,
there goes my golf invite.

1:03:41.121 --> 1:03:42.819
Sometimes it's good
to be an asshole.

1:03:44.429 --> 1:03:47.345
- And it was kinda hot.
- Oh, okay.

1:03:47.388 --> 1:03:49.042
Let's go to bed.

1:03:49.086 --> 1:03:51.828
Yeah, I'll get a broom
for the glass.

1:03:55.570 --> 1:03:56.745
What?

1:03:56.789 --> 1:03:59.487
I think Sasha left her earring.

1:03:59.531 --> 1:04:02.708
- Oh, I'll go drop it off.
- Now?

1:04:02.751 --> 1:04:04.623
I mean, yeah,
it looks expensive.

1:04:04.666 --> 1:04:06.016
They're gonna be looking
for it and stuff, so...

1:04:06.059 --> 1:04:08.279
You're not gonna
apologize again, are you?

1:04:08.322 --> 1:04:10.237
- No.
- Do not apologize again.

1:04:10.281 --> 1:04:12.022
No way. No way.

1:04:12.065 --> 1:04:15.199
- Fuck golf.
- Yeah, fuck golf.

1:04:15.242 --> 1:04:17.679
- Okay.
- Okay, I'll just put it
in the mailbox.

1:04:56.805 --> 1:04:58.720
A little late for selling
Girl Scout cookies, isn't it?

1:04:58.764 --> 1:05:00.940
Sasha dropped her earring,
so I brought it by.

1:05:00.984 --> 1:05:03.334
Oh, thanks, bud.
Yeah, good night.

1:05:03.377 --> 1:05:06.554
Hey, um,
just wanted to say sorry,
you know, about tonight.

1:05:06.598 --> 1:05:09.079
It was kinda crazy and very
out of character for me,

1:05:09.122 --> 1:05:12.082
- so I definitely should've--
- Hey, we weren't
blameless either.

1:05:12.125 --> 1:05:15.520
Already forgotten.
What were we talking about?
Sleep tight.

1:05:15.563 --> 1:05:18.740
And, you know,
I should've been honest
about the house upfront.

1:05:18.784 --> 1:05:20.960
- You're right.
- Mm, well, people die.

1:05:21.004 --> 1:05:23.006
What are you gonna do?
It was 17 years ago.

1:05:23.049 --> 1:05:25.312
Anyways, I'm beat.
Have a good night.

1:05:25.356 --> 1:05:27.619
Hey, how did you know
it was 17 years ago?

1:05:27.662 --> 1:05:29.403
You said that.

1:05:31.188 --> 1:05:33.364
I don't think
I was that specific.

1:05:43.026 --> 1:05:44.941
Lucky guess. I, uh--

1:05:44.984 --> 1:05:46.464
Help! Help!

1:05:46.507 --> 1:05:47.944
You know, Sash,
turn down the TV!

1:05:47.987 --> 1:05:49.728
Yeah, she is going deaf.

1:05:49.771 --> 1:05:51.338
Too many EDM shows in Ibiza.

1:05:51.382 --> 1:05:53.079
Call the police!

1:05:53.123 --> 1:05:55.212
Wait, what was that?

1:06:11.968 --> 1:06:14.883
What the fuck?

1:06:14.927 --> 1:06:16.407
You know, I--

1:06:19.062 --> 1:06:20.280
Honestly?

1:06:21.412 --> 1:06:22.979
For the first time tonight,

1:06:23.022 --> 1:06:25.720
I've got nothing.

1:06:44.565 --> 1:06:46.045
You know, you're not alone.

1:06:46.089 --> 1:06:47.568
Most people hear
the term "twins"

1:06:47.612 --> 1:06:49.918
and they just assume identical.

1:06:49.962 --> 1:06:53.139
Fraternal twins just aren't
as weird or cool, I guess.

1:06:53.183 --> 1:06:54.836
I thought you guys
were a couple?

1:06:54.880 --> 1:06:56.012
Oh, no, we're not a couple,

1:06:56.055 --> 1:06:57.578
if that's what you're saying.

1:06:57.622 --> 1:06:59.798
- That's gross, Adam.
- Yeah.

1:06:59.841 --> 1:07:03.584
Adam, it's time for you
to meet your neighbors,

1:07:03.628 --> 1:07:06.587
Jim and Barbara Berk.

1:07:06.631 --> 1:07:09.329
Longtime local residents,
if my memory serves me.

1:07:09.373 --> 1:07:13.377
Jim is a corporate jackal
with a taste in male escorts

1:07:13.420 --> 1:07:16.858
and Babs has a green thumb
and loves a good racist joke.

1:07:16.902 --> 1:07:20.558
Please help us.

1:07:20.601 --> 1:07:23.082
- Please.
- Oh, she said that
you and Margo

1:07:23.126 --> 1:07:25.258
should do, like, a double date
or dinner or something.

1:07:25.302 --> 1:07:26.520
That's such a good idea.

1:07:26.564 --> 1:07:28.696
Why are you doing this?

1:07:28.740 --> 1:07:31.264
- Why?
- What is he saying?

1:07:31.308 --> 1:07:33.266
No clue.

1:07:33.310 --> 1:07:36.400
I bet you have
a lot of questions, Adam.

1:07:36.443 --> 1:07:39.490
Well, when Sasha and I
were kids,

1:07:39.533 --> 1:07:41.013
we used to play this game.

1:07:41.057 --> 1:07:43.581
We called it Bait The Bear.

1:07:47.324 --> 1:07:50.414
Lipstick on Dad's shirt,
cigarette ash in Mom's cooking.

1:07:50.457 --> 1:07:54.679
We would do anything
to get our parents to fight.

1:07:54.722 --> 1:07:56.463
Because if they were busy
beating each other,

1:07:56.507 --> 1:07:59.858
then they were too busy
to mess with us.

1:07:59.901 --> 1:08:04.732
Now admittedly,
one night we pushed them
a little too far.

1:08:04.776 --> 1:08:06.169
And after that,
we burned through

1:08:06.212 --> 1:08:08.084
a lot of foster parents
playing that game.

1:08:08.127 --> 1:08:09.650
I mean, none of them
killed each other,

1:08:09.694 --> 1:08:11.304
but it's not like they wrote us
Christmas cards either.

1:08:11.348 --> 1:08:15.308
- Oh, God.
- I like to think that
we grew up after that.

1:08:15.352 --> 1:08:17.049
- Yeah, I think so.
- Yeah.

1:08:17.093 --> 1:08:20.922
Even so, we got in the habit
of driving out here

1:08:20.966 --> 1:08:23.447
past the old house
every once and a while.

1:08:23.490 --> 1:08:26.189
And then, yeah,
tonight we saw a party

1:08:26.232 --> 1:08:29.366
and, I don't know,
we couldn't resist.

1:08:29.409 --> 1:08:31.281
It was the scene of the crime,

1:08:31.324 --> 1:08:34.719
and, yeah, we even got up
to our old tricks a little bit,

1:08:34.762 --> 1:08:37.374
but I do feel like it's been
very therapeutic for us.

1:08:37.417 --> 1:08:39.506
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:08:39.550 --> 1:08:42.509
- Why the long face?
- Adam, don't you get it?

1:08:42.553 --> 1:08:46.426
We liked you guys,
so we pivoted, so to speak.

1:08:46.470 --> 1:08:49.603
Otherwise it'd be your throats
we were about to cut.

1:08:49.647 --> 1:08:51.344
Yeah, we fucked
with you guys pretty hard.

1:08:51.388 --> 1:08:54.739
But at the end of the day,
you guys, you have your flaws,

1:08:54.782 --> 1:08:57.176
but you're not a bad couple.

1:08:57.220 --> 1:08:58.917
It's only fun
if it's a bad couple.

1:08:58.960 --> 1:09:02.573
Yeah, not like
these two shitbags.

1:09:02.616 --> 1:09:04.705
Remember me, Mr. Berk?

1:09:04.749 --> 1:09:08.187
It's Tommy from
across the street.

1:09:08.231 --> 1:09:10.581
- I'm all grown up.
- So, these two knew

1:09:10.624 --> 1:09:13.018
what was going on
at our house
when we were kids.

1:09:13.061 --> 1:09:14.454
They knew what
our parents were doing

1:09:14.498 --> 1:09:16.195
not only to each other,
but to us as well.

1:09:16.239 --> 1:09:18.806
I didn't know anything!
This is insane!

1:09:18.850 --> 1:09:20.199
Oh, yes, you did.

1:09:20.243 --> 1:09:21.635
You knew everything
that was going on,

1:09:21.679 --> 1:09:24.029
and you never lifted
a fat fucking finger,

1:09:24.072 --> 1:09:26.205
just like the rest of
this snobby neighborhood.

1:09:26.249 --> 1:09:28.381
We didn't do anything!
You are crazy!

1:09:28.425 --> 1:09:30.557
- Oh, shut up.
- I had no idea!

1:09:30.601 --> 1:09:32.690
Please! Please!

1:09:33.908 --> 1:09:36.259
Well, what do we think?

1:09:37.738 --> 1:09:39.958
Cantaloupe or rutabaga?

1:09:40.001 --> 1:09:43.353
Mmm, cantaloupe.

1:09:43.396 --> 1:09:45.093
Okay.

1:09:49.185 --> 1:09:51.491
No, please! Oh, God!

1:09:51.535 --> 1:09:53.145
Oh, my God.

1:10:26.700 --> 1:10:28.441
Beat you.

1:10:30.313 --> 1:10:33.881
Sorry. Looks like the value
on your house just dropped.

1:10:33.925 --> 1:10:37.233
By at least half when I get done
with my little manifesto.

1:10:37.276 --> 1:10:39.235
I think I might do
a quick carving job.

1:10:39.278 --> 1:10:41.628
You know,
fuck with the bodies?

1:10:43.935 --> 1:10:46.851
Mutilations are hell
for resale value.

1:10:52.422 --> 1:10:53.814
Adam!

1:10:56.077 --> 1:10:58.254
Oh.

1:10:58.297 --> 1:11:00.125
Your lovely bride
must be missing you.

1:11:00.168 --> 1:11:02.693
- No. No, please.
- Survey says?

1:11:02.736 --> 1:11:04.695
Mmm, cantaloupe.

1:11:04.738 --> 1:11:08.220
Oh, my God!
Come on, please. Please!

1:11:09.526 --> 1:11:11.876
Kidding, kidding, kidding.

1:11:11.919 --> 1:11:13.965
Rutabaga.

1:11:14.008 --> 1:11:16.446
We said you weren't
a bad couple,

1:11:16.489 --> 1:11:18.448
but that doesn't mean
you're a good couple.

1:11:23.148 --> 1:11:25.585
- Adam!
- Breakfast in bed,

1:11:25.629 --> 1:11:27.848
hand-picked flowers
for no reason.

1:11:27.892 --> 1:11:30.024
Remember,
it's the little things.

1:11:30.068 --> 1:11:34.333
And never take
a bad day out on your kid

1:11:34.377 --> 1:11:36.683
unless you want him
to end up like us.

1:11:47.651 --> 1:11:48.652
Adam!

1:12:22.903 --> 1:12:24.775
Fuck.

1:12:33.392 --> 1:12:35.438
Come on. Come on.

1:12:45.143 --> 1:12:47.711
Is that the house?

1:12:48.886 --> 1:12:51.149
Oh, God! Oh, my God!

1:12:51.192 --> 1:12:52.933
I am so sorry, um...

1:12:57.198 --> 1:12:58.983
Uh...

1:13:15.434 --> 1:13:17.697
Margo. Um...

1:13:21.397 --> 1:13:23.224
Oh, God.

1:13:23.268 --> 1:13:25.009
Watch where you're going.

1:13:25.052 --> 1:13:27.403
It's a family neighborhood,
bitch.

1:14:39.126 --> 1:14:42.129
Adam? Adam!

1:14:43.348 --> 1:14:44.436
Help!

1:14:45.698 --> 1:14:47.961
Help us!

1:14:50.834 --> 1:14:52.488
Help!

1:14:59.103 --> 1:15:01.497
Police are still
seeking siblings

1:15:01.540 --> 1:15:03.760
who posed as husband and wife

1:15:03.803 --> 1:15:05.544
in the exclusive
Canyon Heights area

1:15:05.588 --> 1:15:07.938
to socialize with one couple

1:15:07.981 --> 1:15:10.070
and brutally slay another.

1:15:10.114 --> 1:15:13.117
Criminologist Carl Wheeler,
who has written about the case,

1:15:13.160 --> 1:15:14.901
speculated the reasoning...

1:15:14.945 --> 1:15:17.034
...behind
the Kodak Drive killers'

1:15:17.077 --> 1:15:19.427
return to the scene
of the crime.

1:15:19.471 --> 1:15:22.996
Recreating traumatic events
so you can control them

1:15:23.040 --> 1:15:26.130
is a common coping technique
for those suffering from PTSD.

1:15:26.173 --> 1:15:29.350
Police say the manhunt
for the siblings is ongoing,

1:15:29.394 --> 1:15:32.658
and they are coordinating with
federal authorities nationwide.

1:15:32.702 --> 1:15:34.617
I'm Bishop Squire, report--

1:15:43.626 --> 1:15:44.975
Afternoon.

1:15:57.640 --> 1:15:58.728
Hey, baby.

1:16:01.165 --> 1:16:03.776
That's sweet. Lucky me.

1:16:03.820 --> 1:16:05.038
Where's Dylan?

1:16:05.082 --> 1:16:07.911
Playdate at Teeny and Frank's.

1:16:07.954 --> 1:16:11.741
Ah, well, hopefully she's not
giving him riflery lessons.

1:16:11.784 --> 1:16:15.962
Well, I got good news.

1:16:16.006 --> 1:16:19.139
I rented us a place. Surprise.

1:16:19.183 --> 1:16:20.924
You're gonna love it.
It's a couple blocks
from our old house.

1:16:20.967 --> 1:16:22.795
I got movers to come
on Monday, so--

1:16:22.839 --> 1:16:26.016
- Adam? No.
- Yeah?

1:16:26.059 --> 1:16:29.759
- What do you mean no?
- You heard me.
We can't cut and run.

1:16:29.802 --> 1:16:31.238
Well, no.
This is what you wanted.

1:16:31.282 --> 1:16:32.805
It's our old neighborhood,
you know?

1:16:32.849 --> 1:16:34.590
You're gonna love this place.

1:16:34.633 --> 1:16:36.026
We'll put our house on
the market, like, next week.

1:16:36.069 --> 1:16:37.505
We'll take a big hit,
but so what?

1:16:37.549 --> 1:16:39.551
Because we will buy
a house again someday.

1:16:39.595 --> 1:16:42.641
- No way.
- Dylan's bad dreams are gone.

1:16:42.685 --> 1:16:45.426
In fact,
he's never been happier.

1:16:45.470 --> 1:16:48.429
- You can't be serious.
- You were right.

1:16:48.473 --> 1:16:52.782
We worked hard.
We deserve this.
We earned this house.

1:16:52.825 --> 1:16:56.742
Yeah, sure, but,
you know, those lunatics
could definitely--

1:16:56.786 --> 1:16:58.657
They had their chance.
