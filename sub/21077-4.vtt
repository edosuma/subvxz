00:07.900 --> 00:11.604
<i> It's that time of year, love birds.</i>

00:11.639 --> 00:13.885
<i>The annual Shirley Chisholm
Dance is coming.</i>

00:13.920 --> 00:16.171
<i>Remember, boys are
not permitted to say no</i>

00:16.172 --> 00:18.780
<i>if asked to the dance.
Happy hunting, beezys.</i>

00:18.815 --> 00:20.209
This some ol' bullshit.

00:20.211 --> 00:22.111
When are men gonna get
their way in this country?

00:22.113 --> 00:24.380
This what women been fighting for...
the right to choose.

00:24.382 --> 00:26.148
And since Randy's out of town,

00:26.150 --> 00:28.037
Cindy's got no choice but to ask me.

00:28.072 --> 00:30.185
That's why I wore
my Michael Jordan cologne.

00:30.187 --> 00:32.104
Man, that shit stink.

00:32.140 --> 00:34.423
That's why that nig's
always crying on the internet.

00:34.915 --> 00:36.425
Now that women can choose,

00:36.427 --> 00:38.494
it's gonna be like the NBA Draft,

00:38.496 --> 00:42.470
and you know
I'ma be a thottery pick.

00:43.334 --> 00:45.501
<i>Jamal!</i>

00:45.503 --> 00:46.869
- Oh, shit.
- And it looks like

00:46.871 --> 00:49.038
you're about to be drafted
by the Memphis Grizzlies.

00:49.040 --> 00:53.375
I'm taking yo thick ass to the
Shirley Chisholm Dance, motherfucker.

00:53.377 --> 00:55.377
Who the fuck
is Shirley Chisholm anyway?

00:55.379 --> 00:57.546
And why does this porn star
get her own dance?

00:57.548 --> 00:59.730
She did the first
interracial blowjob.

00:59.765 --> 01:02.084
She was the Jackie Robinson of porn.

01:02.086 --> 01:04.753
Okay, first off, y'all are stupid.

01:04.754 --> 01:07.900
Shirley Chisholm was Secretary
of the House Democratic Caucus,

01:07.935 --> 01:10.326
a member of both
the House of Representatives

01:10.328 --> 01:14.196
and the New York State Assembly.
She also ran for President.

01:14.198 --> 01:16.886
Wow, she ran for President
and sucked dick for a living?

01:16.921 --> 01:19.835
- Talk about a modern woman.
- Anyway, Grover,

01:19.837 --> 01:22.198
I was gonna go with Randy,
but he's wild and out

01:22.233 --> 01:24.506
at the Nick Cannon
Comedy Conference in Delaware.

01:24.508 --> 01:27.309
And since I don't like any of
the other guys in school,

01:27.311 --> 01:30.980
I was wondering if you weren't
busy Saturday night,

01:30.982 --> 01:33.882
if you'd like to...

01:33.884 --> 01:35.786
- Go to the dance with me?!
- Huh?

01:38.361 --> 01:40.022
Oh, hell nah.

01:40.024 --> 01:42.492

<i><font color="cyan"> sync & correction by f1nc0

01:46.316 --> 01:48.912
This must be what Biggie felt like,
'cause I'm ready to die.

01:48.947 --> 01:51.016
I can't go to the dance
with no crackhead.

01:51.018 --> 01:53.109
Look on the bright side.
Crack creates legends,

01:53.144 --> 01:56.488
like DMX, Lawrence Taylor,
and Marion Barry.

01:56.490 --> 01:58.757
Shit, Cracky might win a Grammy,

01:58.759 --> 02:02.372
- or she might become the next Mayor of D.C.
- Well, unless she gonna

02:02.407 --> 02:04.663
turn into Whitney Houston
by Saturday, I'm fucked.

02:04.665 --> 02:08.265
- I don't wanna go to the dance with you.
- Your body, my choice.

02:08.268 --> 02:11.736
I wish one of these chicks would
come out and try to body me.

02:11.738 --> 02:13.371
To hell with
a Shirley Chisholm Dance.

02:13.373 --> 02:16.274
- Uh, Milk...
- Oh, hell no.

02:17.377 --> 02:20.045
- But...
- No, before you even ask...

02:20.047 --> 02:21.413
ain't no way
I'm going to the dance

02:21.415 --> 02:23.114
with a dickless version of Jamal.

02:23.116 --> 02:25.904
Now take both of your
chocolate boxes, and kick rocks.

02:25.939 --> 02:28.420
This wigger!

02:28.422 --> 02:31.556
I'm telling you, it's this whole
Shirley Chisholm Dance thing.

02:31.558 --> 02:34.893
The fact that they get to choose
empowers them.

02:34.895 --> 02:37.262
It's like bears
coming out of hibernation,

02:37.264 --> 02:39.364
and we ain't nothing
but some salmon, my nigs.

02:42.900 --> 02:46.072
- Aye, Griselda, what it smell like?
- Shit, smell good.

02:46.074 --> 02:47.641
What them stank balls do?

02:47.643 --> 02:51.011
Oh, word, I ain't know
you was coming like that.

02:51.013 --> 02:52.479
- You single?
- Not no more.

02:52.481 --> 02:55.015
I'm choosing you to go to
the dance with me.

02:55.017 --> 02:58.051
Now gimme that tongue, nigga.

02:58.053 --> 03:00.687
- Walk me to class.
- Okay, then.

03:00.689 --> 03:03.089
I thought you said you wasn't
gonna let no chick claim you.

03:03.091 --> 03:05.058
You see that ass, though, my nig?

03:05.060 --> 03:08.562
- Don't you slap my man.
- I love this bitch.

03:08.564 --> 03:10.931
Man, if Milk snagged Griselda,

03:10.933 --> 03:15.402
I know I'm 'bout to be
in there, pimp. Peep game.

03:15.404 --> 03:18.038
You wanna wet dicks and chill?

03:18.040 --> 03:20.106
Trying to Hulu and chili?

03:20.108 --> 03:21.741
You trying to
disappoint your daddy?

03:23.712 --> 03:26.646
Aye, baby,
how 'bout you and I, uh...

03:26.648 --> 03:31.051
<i>You are fuckin' hilarious.</i>

03:31.053 --> 03:33.353
<i>L-O-L. L-O-L.</i>

03:33.355 --> 03:36.022
Damn, I would've fuck her too.

03:37.726 --> 03:42.112
- Jamal!
- Aye, your girl's bellowing.

03:42.113 --> 03:44.843
Stop fighting it, Jamal. You
know you going with big drawls.

03:44.878 --> 03:47.834
Never that!

03:47.836 --> 03:51.073
<i>Don't tell anyone I'm in here.</i>

03:51.542 --> 03:52.941
<i>Just a reminder, guys,</i>

03:52.943 --> 03:55.710
<i>the Shirley Chisholm Dance
is just three days away.</i>

03:55.712 --> 03:57.712
<i>There are still
some available suitors left,</i>

03:57.714 --> 03:59.981
<i>like Jank Eye Jarvis and Jamal.</i>

03:59.983 --> 04:02.217
Uh, at least I'm going.

04:02.219 --> 04:04.586
- Keep the change.
- What up, Cindy?

04:04.588 --> 04:05.620
You find anyone to go to
the dance with?

04:05.622 --> 04:08.256
Not yet. Still deciding.

04:08.258 --> 04:09.824
I have a lot of options.

04:09.826 --> 04:13.328
I got two terabytes
of dick pics to sift through.

04:14.431 --> 04:15.964
Oh, great, here's another one.

04:15.966 --> 04:19.267
No, wait, it's just a picture
of an uncircumcised pepperoni.

04:19.269 --> 04:21.269
Be right back.
I need more light.

04:21.271 --> 04:22.537
Too bad you going with Cracky.

04:22.539 --> 04:24.472
It would've been much easier
going with you.

04:24.474 --> 04:25.774
We could've had fun.

04:25.776 --> 04:28.643
So if, uh,
Cracky doesn't go to the dance,

04:28.645 --> 04:29.611
does that mean
you'll go with me?

04:29.613 --> 04:33.882
We'll never know, will we?
See you later, new booty.

04:37.321 --> 04:40.388
Looks like I'm the only one that's
gonna go to the dance and get some.

04:40.390 --> 04:42.624
But don't worry, Grove,
I'll let you smell the nine.

04:42.626 --> 04:45.142
I don't want Cracky's crack.
I want Cindy's.

04:45.177 --> 04:46.461
I guess I gotta go over
to her house

04:46.463 --> 04:48.096
and break a crackhead's heart.

04:49.933 --> 04:52.167
What are you doing?
Lipstick doesn't go there.

04:52.169 --> 04:53.935
I'm just trying to fix myself up.

04:53.937 --> 04:55.995
Girl, you look like
the puppet from "Saw."

04:56.030 --> 04:59.574
- I was going for Lil' Kim.
- The puppet from "Saw" is cuter.

04:59.576 --> 05:01.338
I know he's only going to
the dance with me

05:01.373 --> 05:03.578
'cause he has to.
I want him to like me!

05:03.580 --> 05:06.514
Well, Cracky, that's what
makeup, weaves, fake asses,

05:06.516 --> 05:08.416
and non-surgical facelifts are for.

05:08.418 --> 05:10.523
We use that
to get the boys interested,

05:10.558 --> 05:13.138
but keeping them is all about
what's on the inside.

05:13.173 --> 05:15.423
On the inside?
You mean like Methadone?

05:15.425 --> 05:17.659
No, girl,
I mean your good qualities.

05:17.661 --> 05:19.694
Once what's on the inside
gets out,

05:19.696 --> 05:22.297
Grover can see you
for who you really are.

05:22.299 --> 05:24.099
I'm more than a girl with
a pipe dream.

05:24.101 --> 05:27.302
I have a real dream
that happens to include a pipe.

05:27.304 --> 05:29.137
- Help me, Cindy!
- I've got an idea.

05:29.139 --> 05:30.572
I'm gonna give you a makeover.

05:30.574 --> 05:33.569
Let's start with eyebrows,
'cause, girl, you need some.

05:35.000 --> 05:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:59.236 --> 06:02.370
Now you're ready.

06:04.365 --> 06:06.031
'Bout goddamn time you showed up

06:06.033 --> 06:08.233
- with the crack, nigga.
- Nah, nah, you got it wrong.

06:08.235 --> 06:10.035
- I'm here for Cracky.
- Uh, which one?

06:10.037 --> 06:12.604
- My wife or my daughter?
- I'm hoping your daughter.

06:12.606 --> 06:15.521
Oh, no, no, no...
I can't sell my daughter.

06:15.556 --> 06:17.509
See, that's what got me
locked up the last time.

06:17.511 --> 06:20.378
<i>Now, Crocodile, I know
you didn't sell my grandbaby!</i>

06:20.380 --> 06:22.420
Oh, Momma, shut up, please!

06:22.455 --> 06:25.383
- I'm trying to do business.
- Where's the TV?

06:25.385 --> 06:28.520
I sold the TV, Momma.
You know I'm sick!

06:28.522 --> 06:31.590
- Uh, I can come back.
- Hold on, Grover!

06:33.894 --> 06:36.094
Hey, Grover,
I see you met my father.

06:36.096 --> 06:39.965
- Damn, Cracky!
- Actually, my name is Patricia.

06:39.967 --> 06:41.299
Oh...

06:41.301 --> 06:42.715
you trying to fuck with my daughter?

06:42.750 --> 06:44.536
See, well,
there's rules to that shit.

06:44.538 --> 06:47.939
Rule number one,
the first hour is $25.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.996
- Wait, what?
- Oh, man, come on now.

06:50.031 --> 06:51.509
Ju-just gimme ten then, baby.

06:51.511 --> 06:55.213
<i>Crocodile, get yo ass in this house,
and stop trying to sell the baby.</i>

06:55.215 --> 06:57.449
Oh, come on now, Momma.
You know I'm sick!

06:57.751 --> 07:00.585
So what did you wanna
talk to me about?

07:00.587 --> 07:02.349
We're still going to the dance, right?

07:02.384 --> 07:04.689
Oh, hell yeah...
we still going to the dance.

07:04.691 --> 07:07.225
As fine as you is,
I'm going to be a legend,

07:07.227 --> 07:09.761
and you going to be a legina.
Selfie.

07:18.584 --> 07:19.569
What the hell?!

07:19.571 --> 07:21.858
So that's what you like?
You can have that bitch then.

07:21.893 --> 07:23.506
Go be with that bitch.
Go be with her.

07:23.508 --> 07:25.002
- Be with that bitch.
- Who?

07:26.061 --> 07:27.143
Don't play dumb, my nigga.

07:27.145 --> 07:30.819
- I seen you thinking about that hoe.
- Gee whiz, I wasn't.

07:30.883 --> 07:33.616
I-I swear, babe. I wasn't
thinking of anyone but you.

07:33.618 --> 07:35.418
Nuh-uh, nigga.
You don't think I can read minds?

07:35.420 --> 07:38.020
I can see inside you, motherfucker.

07:38.022 --> 07:41.314
- Hey, look, I'm real...
- Shut up. You make me sick.

07:42.427 --> 07:46.128
- Oh, my God, what is this?
- Keep it. It's a promise blade.

07:46.130 --> 07:47.430
You don't cheat on me,

07:47.432 --> 07:51.500
and I promise I won't cut
your motherfuckin' face off.

07:51.502 --> 07:52.869
Love ya.

07:53.137 --> 07:55.671
Uh, what the fuck just happened?
Is you good?

07:55.673 --> 07:57.874
Oh, she just passionate, homey.

07:57.876 --> 07:58.941
<i>Damn, girl, you look dope.</i>

07:58.943 --> 08:01.410
<i>You need help hauling
that junk in the trunk?</i>

08:01.412 --> 08:03.412
Is all this attention for me?

08:03.414 --> 08:05.481
And me.
We the new "it" couple.

08:05.483 --> 08:08.918
Grover and Patricia.
But y'all can call us Grotricia.

08:08.920 --> 08:12.288
Uh, guys, this is Cracky,
AKA Patricia.

08:12.290 --> 08:14.777
- Uh, h-hey, fellas.
- Damn...

08:14.941 --> 08:17.560
aye, she look good with a
shower and a middle tooth.

08:17.562 --> 08:20.129
I see you, Grove.
You got yourself a bad one.

08:20.131 --> 08:22.800
Oh, man, she look good.
God damn, nigga, you

08:22.835 --> 08:24.267
- lucky as fuck.
- Now that I got Patricia,

08:24.269 --> 08:26.068
I don't even need to
chase after Cindy no more.

08:26.103 --> 08:28.404
- Randy can have her.
- Good work, Grove.

08:28.406 --> 08:29.872
Welcome to the smash bros.

08:29.874 --> 08:32.642
- Well, what about me?
- You can have Rhiyonce.

08:32.644 --> 08:35.278
She's sloppy as fuck.
What happened to her?

08:35.280 --> 08:38.073
She and Griselda got into it.
Rhiyonce had her for a minute,

08:38.107 --> 08:40.182
but you know
how passionate Griselda is.

08:40.183 --> 08:43.552
Anyway, enjoy.
That mouth still Lebron.

08:45.156 --> 08:49.458
Hey, Big Baby Boo.
What you up to?

08:49.460 --> 08:52.028
Don't you Baby Boo me!
You been hiding ever since

08:52.029 --> 08:54.597
they announced the
Shirley Chisholm Dance.

08:54.599 --> 09:00.202
Girl, wasn't nobody ducking you.
You know you my main.

09:00.204 --> 09:02.438
Now go ahead, hurry up,
and ask me.

09:02.440 --> 09:05.675
Your mom's gonna need time to
stitch them three dresses together.

09:05.677 --> 09:09.045
Fuck you, nigga!
I'm going with a real man.

09:09.047 --> 09:11.247
The fuck?!
I can't believe this!

09:11.249 --> 09:13.616
- Mumblemouth? Whaat?!
- Aye, man, you...

09:13.618 --> 09:14.946
you know you can mumble
these nuts in yo mouth?

09:14.981 --> 09:16.098
That's my job now.

09:16.133 --> 09:19.355
Come on, baby.
You can mumble in this jungle.

09:19.357 --> 09:22.191
I used to mumble in her jungle.

09:22.226 --> 09:25.027
It looks like it's just
you and me, Rhiyonce.

09:25.329 --> 09:27.280
What the fuck?

09:27.315 --> 09:30.199
You know the game, boy.
Yo bitch chose me.

09:34.272 --> 09:36.405
Hold on now.
Time out.

09:36.407 --> 09:39.308
Hey, my name is
Jeffery the Referee.

09:39.310 --> 09:42.244
Yeah, I know it rhymes.

09:42.246 --> 09:44.347
So look,
my wife and I is on break...

09:44.349 --> 09:47.165
Damn, even the ref
is hollering at yo girl.

09:47.200 --> 09:49.251
That's what happens
when you have a bad one.

09:49.253 --> 09:51.322
You wanna see my résumé?

09:53.725 --> 09:56.525
Being with a bad bitch
is starting to make me feel bad,

09:56.527 --> 09:58.527
and like a bitch.
Where you been?

09:58.529 --> 10:00.115
And what's up with the hoodie?

10:00.150 --> 10:01.682
Stop asking me all these questions.

10:01.717 --> 10:03.933
- It's not her fault.
- Whose fault?

10:03.935 --> 10:06.435
- Oh, shit.
- Damn, who beat yo ass?

10:06.437 --> 10:07.837
Griselda, but I deserved it.

10:07.839 --> 10:10.573
I shouldn't have asked Siri
for directions in front of her.

10:10.575 --> 10:12.508
I should've just stayed lost, my nig.

10:12.510 --> 10:14.577
I'm sorry. I... I love you.

10:14.579 --> 10:16.746
What the fuck
is happening to us, man?

10:16.748 --> 10:19.382
I lost my girl to a guy
who can't talk.

10:19.384 --> 10:21.851
Milk is being abused by a dime.

10:21.853 --> 10:24.653
It's like
"Freaky Friday After Next."

10:24.655 --> 10:27.690
Shirley Chisholm Dance turned
us into some straight bitches.

10:27.692 --> 10:30.760
It's turned y'all into some bitches.
I'm still a ledge.

10:30.762 --> 10:34.430
I used to be a legend
until Medina abandoned me.

10:34.432 --> 10:36.165
I miss her so much.

10:36.167 --> 10:38.567
The sweat under her titties...

10:38.569 --> 10:41.632
it smelled like
all-you-can-eat garlic knots.

10:43.074 --> 10:45.024
Are you crying over some
poontang, motherfucker?

10:45.059 --> 10:48.063
It's okay to be fat, son,
but fat and a bitch

10:48.064 --> 10:49.415
will never get you no pussy.

10:49.450 --> 10:53.763
Do you understand what
I'm saying to you, you fat bitch?

10:53.798 --> 10:56.291
I'm trying to be helpful,
you fat bitch!

10:56.326 --> 11:01.223
Man, I look like Fat Albert.

11:01.225 --> 11:04.326
<i>Hey, hey, hey,
I ain't that fat, nigga.</i>

11:04.328 --> 11:06.429
<i>You better get
your shit together, Jamal.</i>

11:06.431 --> 11:08.831
<i>You got 24 hours to lose this weight.</i>

11:30.188 --> 11:33.856
- Yes!
- No, you still fat, nigga.

11:44.569 --> 11:48.304
<i>Hey, hey, hey,
you still got a fat ass.</i>

11:48.306 --> 11:50.195
Dysmorphia.

11:51.222 --> 11:53.960
- Long day?
- Girl, since you made me over,

11:53.961 --> 11:57.246
the boys won't leave me alone.
Is it always like this?

11:57.248 --> 12:00.549
The kinda guys you attract,
they'll mess with anybody.

12:00.551 --> 12:02.618
I used to want
the attention from the boys,

12:02.620 --> 12:05.554
but now all I get
is penis pics all day.

12:06.657 --> 12:08.891
- See?
- Bitch, that's Randy's.

12:08.893 --> 12:11.060
I can tell
by the two-tone foreskin.

12:11.062 --> 12:12.964
Oh, you want me
to forward it to you?

12:12.999 --> 12:16.632
No, you can keep it.
Apparently, you're a bone collector.

12:16.634 --> 12:19.802
Whoa, Cindy,
you're sounding kinda jealous.

12:19.804 --> 12:22.404
Jealous?
Why would I be?

12:22.406 --> 12:23.906
I'm still the hottest girl in school.

12:23.908 --> 12:26.413
Not according to the leaderboard...

12:28.179 --> 12:29.820
What the fuck?!
You're hotter than me?

12:29.855 --> 12:31.113
Are you kidding?

12:31.115 --> 12:32.982
I didn't ask for
three terabytes of junk mail.

12:32.984 --> 12:34.850
Three?
Oh, bitch, you bragging?

12:34.852 --> 12:36.719
No, I didn't want any of this.

12:36.721 --> 12:40.556
Oh, okay, now you
acting all coy and shit.

12:40.558 --> 12:42.558
I don't even know what coy means.

12:42.560 --> 12:45.027
- Look I gotta go.
- Where you going?

12:45.029 --> 12:47.897
I was just kidding.
Well, fuck you!

12:47.899 --> 12:50.299
Who put you together?!
Me! That's who!

12:50.301 --> 12:52.001
Who made you popular?!
Me!

12:52.003 --> 12:55.471
Who do I trust?! Me!
'Cause I'm the shit.

13:01.012 --> 13:02.745
<i>- Yeah, girl!
- I wanna give you a pregnancy scan.</i>

13:02.747 --> 13:06.415
<i>- Ooh, yeah...
- Let me bust one up in you.</i>

13:10.288 --> 13:12.321
Leave me alone!

13:12.323 --> 13:14.361
I am not a breezy, a thot,

13:14.396 --> 13:17.626
a hot piece of ass,
or a bad bitch.

13:17.628 --> 13:19.662
I am a human being.

13:19.664 --> 13:21.330
Hey, hey,
what is you guys doing?

13:21.332 --> 13:22.464
Leave my date alone.

13:22.466 --> 13:24.733
- Is you okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

13:24.735 --> 13:27.036
This was all a mistake.
I'm sorry, Grover.

13:27.038 --> 13:29.705
I'm not going to be able to go
to the dance with you.

13:29.707 --> 13:32.808
No date for the dance?
Now I'm really fucked.

13:32.810 --> 13:35.491
- Tough break, kid.
- Yeah, sucks.

13:35.526 --> 13:37.719
Look, son, I know you got
a lot on your mind,

13:37.754 --> 13:39.629
but did she say anything
about my dick pic?

13:39.664 --> 13:41.858
Oh, man, come on!

13:44.036 --> 13:46.203
Look at what I went through.

13:46.205 --> 13:48.172
It took hours to pluck, wax

13:48.174 --> 13:49.754
add new hair,
shave old hair off,

13:49.789 --> 13:52.843
paint my nails, put on
foundation, and for what?

13:52.845 --> 13:55.179
I've already seen every dick
in Chamberlain Heights.

13:55.181 --> 13:56.380
You ain't seen mine.

13:56.382 --> 13:57.481
- What?
- Nothing.

13:57.483 --> 14:00.384
Who cares about the dance?

14:00.386 --> 14:02.219
Let's go to the movies.

14:02.221 --> 14:04.188
We could watch that
new Marlon Wayans movie,

14:04.190 --> 14:06.290
"12 Mo' Years a Slave: Still Slavin'."

14:06.292 --> 14:07.625
What about the dance?

14:07.627 --> 14:09.260
What's the point of going out
if no one see us?

14:09.262 --> 14:11.163
I mean, this is your first dance.

14:11.198 --> 14:13.364
Don't you wanna document it?
You and me together,

14:13.366 --> 14:16.367
all over Facebook and
Instagram, killing it.

14:16.369 --> 14:18.736
Don't let them rob us
of this opportunity to shine.

14:18.738 --> 14:20.337
We're Grotricia, remember?

14:20.339 --> 14:22.273
You're right.
I've never been to a dance.

14:22.275 --> 14:25.543
I tell you what,
I'll go under one condition.

14:25.545 --> 14:28.797
- I go as myself.
- For sheezy.

14:29.315 --> 14:30.614
What you doing?

14:30.616 --> 14:33.217
First of all,
you owe me for a jumbo.

14:33.219 --> 14:35.953
And second,
this is just who I am, Grover.

14:35.955 --> 14:37.539
Please, can you at least wait to go back

14:37.540 --> 14:39.767
to being a crackhead
till after the dance?

14:39.802 --> 14:42.426
Look, Grover,
if you wanna go with me,

14:42.428 --> 14:47.915
- it's going to be as Cracky.
- Oh, man.

14:49.302 --> 14:50.668
All right, hold on.

14:50.670 --> 14:53.137
Let me get a few more
pictures before you do it.

14:53.139 --> 14:55.272
- Hold up, where's my phone?
- I sold it.

14:55.274 --> 14:58.309
- You sold it?
- You know I'm sick!

15:02.315 --> 15:04.682
Need more diet pills.

15:11.824 --> 15:14.525
Jamal?
Damn, you look good.

15:14.527 --> 15:19.029
Nothing tastes as good
as skinny looks and feels.

15:19.031 --> 15:20.464
I can't believe I'm asking this,

15:20.466 --> 15:22.199
but would you go with me
to the dance?

15:22.201 --> 15:23.601
Hell yes.

15:23.603 --> 15:26.669
Let me just lose these fat
love handles right quick,

15:26.704 --> 15:28.706
and I'll be ready to go.

15:32.912 --> 15:35.512
Can you open this for me?

15:51.029 --> 15:54.615
<i>Give me that eggplant.</i>

15:54.650 --> 15:59.004
<i>I paid for Olive Garden.</i>

15:59.039 --> 16:02.839
Bro, the great thing about me is,
like, I don't even need to work out.

16:02.961 --> 16:04.728
Like, all of this is natural.

16:04.730 --> 16:07.886
Bro, not to toot my own horn
or anything, but, like,

16:07.921 --> 16:09.533
did you know that
I'm actually flexible enough

16:09.535 --> 16:12.702
to toot my own horn?
And by that I mean I...

16:12.704 --> 16:15.038
I'm this close to fucking you.

16:15.040 --> 16:18.208
You better not be looking at
any other girl in here.

16:18.270 --> 16:20.303
Boy, look at me
when I'm talking to you.

16:20.305 --> 16:22.172
What are you doing?
Don't look at me.

16:22.174 --> 16:24.941
Keep your eyes down.
What do you think of my dress?

16:24.943 --> 16:26.142
- I think it...
- Shut up!

16:26.144 --> 16:28.672
I don't wanna hear it!
Gimme a kiss...

16:28.686 --> 16:31.248
like you mean it!

16:31.250 --> 16:32.782
Keep crying, hear.

16:32.784 --> 16:35.026
I'ma use your tears for lubricant.

16:38.824 --> 16:41.052
Looks like everybody's having fun.

16:41.087 --> 16:43.118
Don't think
they'll be thinking about us.

16:43.153 --> 16:45.128
Yeah, great.

16:45.190 --> 16:47.188
- Who's Cindy with?
- Who's that?

16:47.223 --> 16:50.694
- He look good.
- It sounds like there are people here.

16:50.696 --> 16:52.862
Are there people here, Cindy?

16:52.864 --> 16:56.441
- Hey, everybody.
- Holy shit. Jamal?

16:56.476 --> 16:57.968
Looks like someone
let the air out of you.

16:57.970 --> 17:00.036
- You all right?
- Who's that?

17:00.038 --> 17:03.540
Is that you, white Jesus?

17:03.542 --> 17:07.470
- Is it time to go to heaven?
- Jesus was black, homey.

17:07.505 --> 17:08.611
They had a documentary on him
on Adult Swim.

17:08.613 --> 17:10.714
What happened to you?

17:10.715 --> 17:13.817
Well, I didn't wanna be
the only one without a date,

17:13.819 --> 17:18.021
so I lost all this weight.
Now I'm here with Cindy.

17:18.022 --> 17:22.058
Well, at least it feels like Cindy.

17:22.060 --> 17:25.762
Ooh, I like that.
Mm, what's your name?

17:25.763 --> 17:27.630
Uh-uh, bitch,
he's here with me.

17:27.632 --> 17:32.035
- Who you calling bitch?
- You, bitch.

17:32.037 --> 17:34.486
I'm so glad I didn't let her
suck the nine.

17:35.907 --> 17:37.574
Come with it!

17:49.588 --> 17:51.921
Whoa... hey...

17:57.829 --> 18:00.030
Oh, girl, oh.

18:04.136 --> 18:07.003
<i>Worldstar.</i>

18:07.005 --> 18:09.605
<i>Yeah.</i>

18:11.977 --> 18:13.710
Ooh!
A titty popped out.

18:13.712 --> 18:17.480
What's it look like?
Someone describe it to me.

18:17.482 --> 18:19.449
Is it ham or beef?

18:19.451 --> 18:21.780
Oh, bitch, oh!

18:22.521 --> 18:24.621
<i>Cat fight! Cat fight!</i>

18:24.623 --> 18:28.165
<i>Cat fight! Cat fight!</i>

18:28.460 --> 18:29.759
Enough!

18:29.761 --> 18:33.679
This empowerment dance
turned us into monsters.

18:33.714 --> 18:35.465
But Shirley Chisholm,

18:35.467 --> 18:38.435
the woman this dance
was named after,

18:38.437 --> 18:40.270
was a pioneer.

18:40.272 --> 18:42.705
Shut up, bitch.
Make me a sandwich.

18:42.707 --> 18:46.409
I'd like some sourdough
bread if you can, bitch.

18:46.411 --> 18:47.243
<i>That's real talk, though.</i>

18:47.245 --> 18:52.115
I will not make you a sandwich!
Those days are over.

18:52.117 --> 18:55.202
When someone told Shirley
Chisholm to make a sandwich,

18:55.237 --> 18:57.591
she told them to
"suck my dick."

18:57.626 --> 19:00.123
I think. Uh, I was high
when I read about it.

19:00.125 --> 19:01.524
The point is,

19:01.526 --> 19:05.295
Shirley Chisholm didn't wanna be
remembered for making sandwiches.

19:05.297 --> 19:09.399
She wanted to be remembered
as a woman who had guts.

19:09.401 --> 19:12.869
Do you girls wanna be
remembered as a thot

19:12.871 --> 19:15.004
or a woman with thoughts?

19:15.006 --> 19:18.908
Ooh, what's this I'm feeling?
It's all warm and tingly,

19:18.910 --> 19:20.944
like I wanna
cover my ass up and shit.

19:20.946 --> 19:25.348
- It's called self-respect.
- Oh, like, yeah, I...

19:25.383 --> 19:27.050
I don't think I want
my titties out either.

19:27.052 --> 19:29.252
This wig been itching me all day.

19:29.254 --> 19:31.321
<i>- Oh, snap!
- Oh, oh, no.</i>

19:31.323 --> 19:33.691
<i>That's what it looks like
without makeup!</i>

19:33.726 --> 19:35.625
<i>No!</i>

19:35.627 --> 19:37.894
They making a break for it.
Lock the door.

19:37.896 --> 19:41.363
<i>Way ahead of you.</i>

19:43.268 --> 19:45.435
Oh, you guys are gonna learn
to like us for who we are,

19:45.437 --> 19:48.505
even if we have to beat
the sexism out of you.

19:48.507 --> 19:49.939
<i>Aah!</i>

19:53.961 --> 19:57.047
I think next year,
we should plan out the next

19:57.048 --> 19:57.930
Shirley Chisholm dance better.

19:57.932 --> 20:00.566
I lost Cindy to Cracky,
and Patricia to crack.

20:00.568 --> 20:02.301
At least everything's
back to normal,

20:02.303 --> 20:04.270
where men are men
and thots are thots.

20:04.272 --> 20:05.717
<i>- Mm-mm-mm!
- Damn, girl.</i>

20:05.752 --> 20:07.807
Well, almost everything.

20:09.647 --> 20:14.163
Mmm. Thanks for nursing
me back to health.

20:14.165 --> 20:17.533
You got it, boo. I'm sorry for
not asking you to the dance.

20:17.577 --> 20:19.465
I just can't let you
take me for granted.

20:19.500 --> 20:21.070
But after not having anyone
to share second lunch

20:21.072 --> 20:23.138
and third dessert with,

20:23.140 --> 20:26.709
I realized that you're
the only one for me, Jamal.

20:28.679 --> 20:31.280
You just gonna sit there
and watch them make out?

20:31.282 --> 20:34.583
Nah, man, now that Griselda ain't
allowed within 100 yards of me,

20:34.585 --> 20:36.752
I got some making up to do
with Rhiyonce.

20:36.754 --> 20:40.089
- What you gonna get into, Grove?
- Well, there go Cindy.

20:40.091 --> 20:42.558
I'm 'bout to go holler before
Randy bitch ass get back.

20:42.560 --> 20:44.627
- You're back!
- Hells yizzas!

20:44.629 --> 20:45.928
In the immortal words of Nick Cannon,

20:45.930 --> 20:48.964
"You can't get rid of me.
I'm here forever."

20:50.368 --> 20:54.270
- Nick Cannon is hilarious.
- He can rap too.

20:54.272 --> 20:56.205
Now everything's back to normal.

21:01.110 --> 21:03.045
You know I'm sick!

21:04.069 --> 21:06.536
