only two teams will remain

to face off
one last time for $50,000.

00:18.486 --> 00:20.486
This is ridiculous.
We don't have time for this.

00:20.488 --> 00:21.820
Don't do this to me now.

00:21.822 --> 00:24.123
We got $50,000

I'm feeling pretty confident.

00:45.780 --> 00:47.112
We won the last Spine Chiller,

00:47.114 --> 00:49.214
and we're really hoping
to keep that momentum going.

00:49.216 --> 00:52.317
Overall, I feel like you guys
hit a home run with this one.

00:52.319 --> 00:53.585
Now we want to show
these other teams

00:53.587 --> 00:54.853

So we're walking to this
challenge feeling like

we really need
to pull it together.

The challenges get much
more scary from here on out,

01:31.125 --> 01:32.591
so get ready.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.660
There's a box that
punishes anyone

01:34.662 --> 01:37.196
that dares
sneak a peak inside --

01:37.198 --> 01:39.565
Pandora's Box.

Once opened, the legend
goes that it will unleash

01:42.336 --> 01:45.604
all the evils of the world
and those who disturb it.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.172
But the Box is kind of old now,

01:47.174 --> 01:50.209
and it's been dishing
out evil for a long time.

01:50.211 --> 01:52.411
It could definitely
use a reboot.

01:52.413 --> 01:54.980
So in this Small Scare, we want
you to combine your skills

01:54.982 --> 01:59.885

-Chicken nuggets, I don't know.

Pizza box.

02:22.443 --> 02:23.775
We have to pull it together --

02:23.777 --> 02:25.177
-Absolutely.

you can't play it safe.

and then all these demons
will come out everywhere.

We wanted to do something
out of the box.

02:35.222 --> 02:37.289
Our design is that evil
demon figured

02:37.291 --> 02:40.259
out a way to get into
people's homes as a pizza box,

out of the pizza.

We're trying to pull off a demon
and it really looked gross.

You're jumping on that eye
right away, right, Shel?

02:52.640 --> 02:53.972
That's what I'm doing
right now.
Okay.

02:53.974 --> 02:55.707
KIMBERLY: Shelby,
she has to pour the sugar eye

02:55.709 --> 02:57.176
for the demon.

02:57.178 --> 02:59.978
I poured clear isomalt
into my eyeball mold,

02:59.980 --> 03:02.014
and then I'm taking
my eyeball transfer sheet,

03:02.016 --> 03:03.916
and I'm just placing it on top.

03:03.918 --> 03:06.118
She has to melt the chocolate
to make the cheese.

03:06.120 --> 03:07.686

with the makeshift
double boiler.

03:09.790 --> 03:13.358
I'm going to do the pizza
top out of rice cereal treat.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.960
It's really important
to get the pizza box right

03:14.962 --> 03:17.696
because without a pizza box,
we don't have a box for Pandora.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.532
Then I grab my fondant,
and I start to cover the box.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.935
-Come on, people.
-Let's knock this out.

monster fortune cookies,

03:35.382 --> 03:37.649
and some sugar chopsticks
to top it off.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.418
We don't want the noodles
to look sparse.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.586
We need quite a few of them.

03:40.588 --> 03:43.155
Arlen uses a round-tipped
carving tool

03:43.157 --> 03:46.124
to create these
long noodle shapes.

03:46.126 --> 03:47.826

03:47.828 --> 03:49.094
Yeah, let's dye 'em green.

03:49.096 --> 03:50.262
Yeah, I'll have --
they'll be different sizes.

03:50.264 --> 03:51.830
Hey, Orly. You feel good?

03:51.832 --> 03:53.665
-See this, my friend?
-Yeah.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.467
-This is real sugar work.
-Oh!

03:55.469 --> 03:58.470
Orly will be creating
the monster fortune cookies

03:58.472 --> 04:00.005
as well as the chopsticks.

04:00.007 --> 04:01.173
ORLY: That's right.

04:01.175 --> 04:03.208
To sell that these are
monster fortune cookies,

04:03.210 --> 04:05.711
Orly pulls some
white sugar fangs

04:05.713 --> 04:07.846
and also a white fortune tongue.

04:07.848 --> 04:10.849
Hey, Cesar, this is gonna come
and eat you alive today.

04:10.851 --> 04:12.017
Come on. Let's go.

04:12.019 --> 04:14.152
I carve the cake
at a downwards angle

04:14.154 --> 04:16.555
to really give it
that takeout box look.

04:16.557 --> 04:17.656
Oh, that's gonna
look awesome.

04:17.658 --> 04:19.891
The takeout box
has to be perfect.

04:19.893 --> 04:22.127
This is a major piece
in telling our story.

04:22.129 --> 04:23.629

enough noodles, guys?

04:23.631 --> 04:24.930
-Cool.
-Ooh, wow.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.365
Yeah.
We might need a few more.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.600

than not enough, right?

04:28.602 --> 04:30.002

Now, Gaten, we know you're
a huge "Halloween Wars" fan.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.372
I am.

05:07.374 --> 05:09.041
What are you looking forward
to the most with these displays?

05:09.043 --> 05:11.810
The big pumpkins, I like looking
at the giant pumpkin work.

05:11.812 --> 05:12.911
It doesn't even look
like pumpkins.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.379
It just looks like
building materials.

05:14.381 --> 05:15.981
-Right.
-I think it's so cool.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.949
You're gonna be
impressed by these.
I am. I can already see.

05:17.951 --> 05:19.518
30 minutes left!

05:19.520 --> 05:20.719
How are you looking, man?

05:20.721 --> 05:22.988
I'm feeling like a baker
carving these doughnuts.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.856
I've got a nice smooth pumpkin
with thick skin.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.558
I'm gonna make
four doughnuts.

05:26.560 --> 05:29.194
Our story is that Pandora
has opened her own bakery,

05:29.196 --> 05:30.895
but every time
she gives it to a customer,

05:30.897 --> 05:32.597
all of their food has gone evil.

05:32.599 --> 05:35.434
I know Arlen's been the king
of smooth pumpkins,

05:35.436 --> 05:37.569
but I'm hoping to get
these doughnuts pretty smooth.

05:37.571 --> 05:40.205
For the doughnuts, I'm using
a cookie cutter circle

05:40.207 --> 05:42.541
to trace the outline
into the side of a pumpkin.

05:42.543 --> 05:44.509
Then I carve the general shape
of the doughnut

05:44.511 --> 05:45.744
and round out the edges.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.579
These doughnuts
are coming out fresh.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.314
Once I have a general
doughnut shape,

05:49.316 --> 05:51.083
I cut around it and pop it out.

05:51.085 --> 05:53.018
All right, guys.
I got one doughnut made.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.386
-It's a plain.
-Hey!

05:54.388 --> 05:55.954
I'm trying to roll
out the fondant

05:55.956 --> 05:57.756
to cover the doughnut box.

05:57.758 --> 06:00.092
Sabrina is using a base
of rice cereal treats

06:00.094 --> 06:01.426
and wrapping it in fondant.

06:01.428 --> 06:03.395
SABRINA: I'm putting the pink
on the outside now

06:03.397 --> 06:05.530
to give it that signature
doughnut-box look.

06:05.532 --> 06:06.898
You know it's the sign
of a good doughnut shop

06:06.900 --> 06:08.066
if the box is pink.

06:08.068 --> 06:10.335
Our Small Scares
have been underwhelming.

06:10.337 --> 06:11.770
Let's fix that, guys.

06:11.772 --> 06:13.772
We're working on melting
down the white sugar

06:13.774 --> 06:15.307
for the back of the eyes.

06:15.309 --> 06:17.509
Cesar's making the sugar
eyes for this challenge.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.811
We want to make sure that
these doughnuts have evil eyes,

06:19.813 --> 06:21.213
so he's making them red.

06:21.215 --> 06:24.015
I want those eyes
to look scary.
Yes, Sabrina.

06:24.017 --> 06:25.984
Eyes always sell the emotion
on anything.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.285
Cesar really needs to step up

06:27.287 --> 06:28.987
and make sure these eyes
look really great.

06:28.989 --> 06:30.789
If they don't look
angry and scary,

06:30.791 --> 06:33.258
my eyes are gonna
look angry and scary.
Yes, ma'am.

06:33.260 --> 06:35.560
KIMBERLY: I'm covering the last
part of the lid.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.295
I've decided to give him
some potato teeth

06:37.297 --> 06:39.698
because they might brown.
-Cool.

06:39.700 --> 06:40.832
KIMBERLY: Lenny's working
on a demon head,

06:40.834 --> 06:42.434
and he decides to make
some potato teeth.

06:42.436 --> 06:44.035
Potato browns really fast,

06:44.037 --> 06:46.638
and it fits the character
and the look perfectly.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.806
I'll make it happen.

06:47.808 --> 06:48.907
Shelby, how you doing?
What are you doing?

06:48.909 --> 06:50.208
I'm making pepperonis.

06:50.210 --> 06:52.744
Shelby has to cut up
the pepperoni and mushrooms

06:52.746 --> 06:54.146
going on top of the pizza.

06:54.148 --> 06:56.448
I want, like, a chargrilled
pepperoni look.

06:56.450 --> 06:59.918
It's a demon pizza,
so it's creepy and gross.

06:59.920 --> 07:00.986
You have other items?

07:00.988 --> 07:02.320
I'm trying to make
mushrooms, too.

07:02.322 --> 07:04.523
Kim, real quick, does that
look like a mushroom?

07:04.525 --> 07:05.891
Oh, my god. Yes.
That is excellent.

07:05.893 --> 07:07.192
Go, Shelby.

07:07.194 --> 07:09.761
How long you think
the chopstick's gonna be?

07:09.763 --> 07:10.796
Like, there.

07:10.798 --> 07:13.298
Orly is creating
the sugar chopsticks,

07:13.300 --> 07:16.468
and he cuts them down
and attaches them to skewers.

07:16.470 --> 07:19.237
Okay, guys. I'm gonna start
carving the skull stamp.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.907
I do the potato-stamp
technique a lot at home

07:21.909 --> 07:23.442
when we're doing
arts and crafts,

07:23.444 --> 07:26.812
but I've never done it
with food color in 45 minutes,

07:26.814 --> 07:28.880
so I'm hoping that
this is going to work.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.615
Okay. This is the front.

07:30.617 --> 07:31.883
I take the potato.

07:31.885 --> 07:34.719
I press it against the box,
cross my fingers...

07:34.721 --> 07:36.455
Pay attention.

07:36.457 --> 07:37.856
...and it works!

07:37.858 --> 07:39.524
Whoo!

07:39.526 --> 07:40.792
Right, dude. Here we go.
Let's open it.
Let's do it.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.028
-Oh!
-Oh, no!

07:43.030 --> 07:44.763
-Close it!
-Try to close it!

07:44.765 --> 07:46.231
-No!
-Ah!

07:46.233 --> 07:48.300
-[ Sighs ] 10 minutes left!
-Ah.

07:48.302 --> 07:50.001

Yes.

We've jelled pretty great
as a team up to this point,

of the competition

CYNTHIA: When Pandora unleashed
all the evil into the world,

10:40.240 --> 10:41.873
she also cursed herself.

into an evil monstrosity,

The fortune cookies

are made of sugar.

10:53.887 --> 10:56.254
For the stamp,
Arlen carved a potato,

10:56.256 --> 11:00.091

are made from pumpkin.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.662
The aging of the box looks cool.

the monster version

11:06.700 --> 11:08.166

a little bit like clams.

11:12.205 --> 11:15.373
The coloring on the fortune
cookies are a bit off.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.375
I would also have pinched
the edges

11:17.377 --> 11:18.810
a little bit more close

11:18.812 --> 11:21.780
so that they resemble the shape
of the fortune cookies,

you actually pulled each noodle

11:24.985 --> 11:29.154

that potato stamp, very clever.

everything inside has gone evil.

opposed to sharp and the eyes,

more depth in the sculptures,

I like this piece a lot.

the biggest pumpkin

the sides in panels,

a lot more like a box,

You're gonna love these eggs.

16:31.124 --> 16:33.157
On top of that,
Cesar is making the eggs

16:33.159 --> 16:35.326
on the back of the house
out of pulled sugar,

16:35.328 --> 16:37.095
and they look
just like real eggs.

16:37.097 --> 16:38.863
Who's hungry for breakfast?

16:38.865 --> 16:41.165
-Hi, Kim.
-Hey, guys.

16:41.167 --> 16:43.768
I love having that extra
help in the kitchen.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.169
-Pleasure.
-Nice to meet you.

16:45.171 --> 16:46.971
What's a planet
without a rocket ship?

16:46.973 --> 16:49.640
This challenge is so fun
because anything goes.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.109
Shelby really loves
space travel.

16:51.111 --> 16:54.412
She thought of the idea to have
aliens trick or treating.

16:54.414 --> 16:56.614
We're one win away
from being in the finale,

16:56.616 --> 17:00.385
so we have to go big,
so we're literally going big.

17:00.387 --> 17:02.620
Holy...that's gigantic.

17:02.622 --> 17:05.857
Lenny goes for the biggest
pumpkin possible

17:05.859 --> 17:07.825
for our alien trick-or-treater.

17:07.827 --> 17:09.427
I have never seen
a pumpkin this big.

17:09.429 --> 17:11.629
It's, like, twice the size
of Lenny's body.

17:11.631 --> 17:14.432
Breaking them apart
sometimes isn't so easy.

17:14.434 --> 17:18.369
And he is struggling
to get this big sucker open.

17:18.371 --> 17:19.904
Aye.

17:19.906 --> 17:21.072
Oh, my goodness.

17:21.074 --> 17:22.740
This one doesn't want
to come apart.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.842
Are you all right
over there, Lenny?

17:24.844 --> 17:27.111
There we go.

17:27.113 --> 17:28.513
Look at that.

17:28.515 --> 17:29.680
Lenny opens up the pumpkin,

17:29.682 --> 17:31.682
and I see pumpkin
flying everywhere.

17:31.684 --> 17:34.285
Lenny is over there
carving like a mad man.

17:34.287 --> 17:36.254
Lenny is gonna make
an alien trick or treater,

17:36.256 --> 17:38.156
and he's gonna be
wearing a clown mask.

17:38.158 --> 17:39.924
I think I came up
with this technique.

17:39.926 --> 17:41.559
I don't know anybody
else that does it.

17:41.561 --> 17:44.695
Shelby is going to pour pools
of sugar with lights in them

17:44.697 --> 17:46.898
that she's calling galaxy ponds.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.299
I'm painting a Milky Way.

17:48.301 --> 17:49.767
KIMBERLY: For the backdrop,

17:49.769 --> 17:52.036
Shelby is
painting planets and stars,

17:52.038 --> 17:54.972
and then she's taking
textured fondant for the Moon,

17:54.974 --> 17:57.675
and we're also gonna do
a lot of sugar crystals.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.744
It's gonna be
a ton of cake to stack.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.980
I am making this giant rocket.

18:02.982 --> 18:04.982
I am carving down my shape.

18:04.984 --> 18:07.018
This is the biggest piece
I've ever made,

18:07.020 --> 18:10.354
at least 200 pounds,
and that's very risky.

18:10.356 --> 18:12.490
I keep doing these huge pieces.

18:12.492 --> 18:13.758
I'm killing myself, here.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.560
You guys, I'm starting
on the pumpkin gargoyle.

18:15.562 --> 18:17.595
You guys, just melting down
the chocolate first

18:17.597 --> 18:18.930
for the chocolate skull.

18:18.932 --> 18:22.233
It is Halloween night,
and King Arthur opens the door

18:22.235 --> 18:23.935
and realizes it's not
a trick-or-treater

18:23.937 --> 18:25.603
after all but a ghost.

18:25.605 --> 18:28.940
I need help making gray fondant.

18:28.942 --> 18:33.511
For our backdrop, we're going to
create this gray marbled stone

18:33.513 --> 18:34.912
look around the castle door.

18:34.914 --> 18:37.782
If I could do some magic,
this would be the time.

18:37.784 --> 18:42.620
We will have a fondant-covered
drawbridge, pulled sugar chains.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.255
Orly is also creating

18:44.257 --> 18:48.126
two beautiful stained-glass
windows on the castle.

18:48.128 --> 18:49.861
To create the stained-glass
windows,

18:49.863 --> 18:53.197
Orly breaks off pieces
of colored isomalt

18:53.199 --> 18:56.400
and then pours melted
isomalt on top of the frame

18:56.402 --> 18:58.002
and allows it to set.

18:58.004 --> 19:00.238
ORLY: Okay.
That's the windows done.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.472
Arlen, how you doing?

19:01.474 --> 19:03.608
Doing good, just getting
those details in there.

19:03.610 --> 19:07.411
CYNTHIA: Arlen has to create two
gargoyles for the drawbridge.

19:07.413 --> 19:10.314
Gargoyles were originally meant
to ward off evil,

19:10.316 --> 19:13.284
but I think this one
actually attracted that ghost.

19:13.286 --> 19:15.119
I will be creating
the stone columns

19:15.121 --> 19:17.989
that the gargoyles are
standing on out of cake,

19:17.991 --> 19:20.424
and then I can get
started on King Arthur.

19:20.426 --> 19:22.627
What year was
the medieval times?

19:22.629 --> 19:23.761
The '80s?

19:23.763 --> 19:25.596
The '80s, of course
it was the '80s.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.165
King Arthur rocked leg warmers.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.834
I sculpt his legs out
of rice krispie treat

19:29.836 --> 19:31.235
and modeling chocolate,

19:31.237 --> 19:33.771
and then I move on
to stacking cake for his torso.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.740
This chocolate is
just melting away.

19:35.742 --> 19:39.177
♪♪

19:39.179 --> 19:40.278
Jonathan,
what are you doing?

19:40.280 --> 19:42.480
I want you to feel
at home here, you know?

19:42.482 --> 19:43.948
I'm making it like
the Upside Down, see?

19:43.950 --> 19:45.082
No. You don't got to do that.

19:45.084 --> 19:46.851
I'm already a huge fan
of your show.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.486
I'm a huge fan of your show.

19:48.488 --> 19:50.354
-Right? Awesome.
-Awesome. Friends!

19:50.356 --> 19:53.257
-Friends!
-Four hours left!

19:53.259 --> 19:55.359
-Four hours, guys.
-Push, push.

19:55.361 --> 19:58.529
My bad, huge fan. My bad.
My bad. I'm sorry, buddy.

19:58.531 --> 20:00.798
Oh, my gosh.
Kim, that thing is huge.

20:00.800 --> 20:01.966
Right? It's like my height.

20:01.968 --> 20:03.901
This rocket is gonna be
ginormous.

20:03.903 --> 20:05.770
We're building the cake
over in our station,

20:05.772 --> 20:07.505
but eventually we're gonna
have to move it

20:07.507 --> 20:10.675
over to our platform,
and that I am dreading.

20:10.677 --> 20:12.176
What do you have left
to do on that spaceship?

20:12.178 --> 20:13.844
I still got a lot
of stuff to do.

20:13.846 --> 20:16.881
Working on the character's face,
trying to get it dialed in.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.616
When it comes to doing
this clown mask,

20:18.618 --> 20:20.251
Lenny has his eye on the prize,

20:20.253 --> 20:23.221
and he's gone into
drill sergeant mode.

20:23.223 --> 20:24.622
Got to get this head on.

20:24.624 --> 20:27.158
KIMBERLY: His detail needs to be
immaculate on this.

20:27.160 --> 20:29.627
I'm making my famous
sugar cookie recipe.

20:29.629 --> 20:31.028
Shelby is making
chocolate-dipped

20:31.030 --> 20:33.130
moon-rock sugar cookies.

20:33.132 --> 20:35.466
I've made this at least
500 times.

20:35.468 --> 20:36.767
KIMBERLY: Shelby is
an award-winning

20:36.769 --> 20:38.402
sugar cookie artist.

20:38.404 --> 20:39.904
I know she's gonna blow
the judges away

20:39.906 --> 20:41.038
with this cookie.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.573
Then I just hit it
with a little foil

20:42.575 --> 20:44.342
to kind of take
some of the chocolate off,

20:44.344 --> 20:45.943
and you got moon cookies.

20:45.945 --> 20:47.211
Cutting into this giant guy,

20:47.213 --> 20:48.946
It's the biggest pumpkin
I've used so far.

20:48.948 --> 20:51.616
I'm making the giant bolder
the viking's hiding behind

20:51.618 --> 20:53.217
from a huge pumpkin.

20:53.219 --> 20:54.919
Boom!
We've got this puppy cracked.

20:54.921 --> 20:57.822
I take a straight handsaw to get
that sharp-edge feel.

20:57.824 --> 20:59.490
This saw is terrible
at cutting wood,

20:59.492 --> 21:01.292
but it goes right
through this pumpkin.

21:01.294 --> 21:02.727
SABRINA:
We got to bring the details.

21:02.729 --> 21:03.928
JEFF: This viking is important

21:03.930 --> 21:05.463
because this guy is
one of our stars.

21:05.465 --> 21:07.999
Push it down.
Get that fur texture.

21:08.001 --> 21:09.934
JEFF: Sabrina is making our
viking's body

21:09.936 --> 21:11.936
out of modeling chocolate
and wrapping it in fondant.

21:11.938 --> 21:13.638
I've got the graham
cracker sablé.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.006
Since we have a campfire,

21:15.008 --> 21:17.308
Cesar's gonna be making
a s'mores-type desert.

21:17.310 --> 21:18.709
Inside the sandwich will be

21:18.711 --> 21:20.778
a maple syrup and honey
marshmallow

21:20.780 --> 21:22.713
with a chocolate pavê
which is sort of like a pudding.

21:22.715 --> 21:23.914
CESAR: Behind that fancy name,

21:23.916 --> 21:25.549
just comes down to
a very simple s'more.

21:25.551 --> 21:27.952
The tasting element is
a huge part of our presentation.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.887
This is gonna be
one of his best ones yet.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.889
CESAR: I got my little dragon
stamp on top,

21:31.891 --> 21:33.791
good flavor, great presentation.

21:33.793 --> 21:36.327
That's all that really matters
at the end of the day.

21:36.329 --> 21:38.296
Thinking about the viking house,

21:38.298 --> 21:41.232
maybe we can use corn silk
on the top of the house.

21:41.234 --> 21:43.567
JEFF: Sabrina comes up with this
idea to use corn silk

21:43.569 --> 21:45.836
as the thatching on the roof
for our viking hut.

21:45.838 --> 21:48.372
She takes the silk from
the corn, puts it in the oven.

21:48.374 --> 21:51.442
That'll dry it out and give it
a great straw look for our roof.

21:51.444 --> 21:53.177
Corn's in, guys.

21:53.179 --> 21:55.980
-How are we doing, you guys?
-I'm working on the ghost head.

21:55.982 --> 21:58.416
We just go with the shock factor

21:58.418 --> 22:00.484
that the ghost will be
floating in midair.

22:00.486 --> 22:03.054
I'm gonna carve all these
skull details really deep.

22:03.056 --> 22:05.556
For the ghost head,
we poured white chocolate

22:05.558 --> 22:06.857
into a skull mold,

22:06.859 --> 22:09.460
and then Arlen came in
with some modeling chocolate

22:09.462 --> 22:10.995
to fill in the fine details.

22:10.997 --> 22:13.197
-What do you think?
-He looks evil.

22:13.199 --> 22:15.666
ORLY: Hey, guys, I'm gonna do
my tasting element.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.768
CYNTHIA:
Orly is creating lemon-mint

22:17.770 --> 22:19.704
white-chocolate truffles.

22:19.706 --> 22:21.572
Taste it before I put it away.

22:21.574 --> 22:23.774
Oh, my gosh.
The mint comes afterwards.
Yeah.

22:23.776 --> 22:25.576
The mint blooms in your throat.

22:25.578 --> 22:27.078
It was quite magical.

22:27.080 --> 22:28.145
Awesome.

22:28.147 --> 22:30.448
After the truffle
filling cooled,

22:30.450 --> 22:32.917
Orly rolled it up into balls
and coated them

22:32.919 --> 22:35.286
in this luxurious cocoa powder,

22:35.288 --> 22:37.021
regal enough for a king.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.589
Make it happen.

22:38.591 --> 22:39.790
Hey. What's burning?

22:39.792 --> 22:42.059
What do you mean?
Oh, my god!

22:42.061 --> 22:43.794
Sabrina forgot about
the corn silk.

22:43.796 --> 22:46.497
We were gonna use that
as the thatching on the roof.

22:46.499 --> 22:48.966
Oh, my god.
We can't use this!

22:48.968 --> 22:50.267
They are destroyed.

22:50.269 --> 22:52.269
This is ridiculous.
We don't have time for this.

22:52.271 --> 22:54.338
This house has to look
like a viking hut.

22:54.340 --> 22:56.374
We don't have time
to make anything else.

22:56.376 --> 22:57.508
This is so awful.

22:59.679 --> 23:00.745
Oh, my god. It's everywhere.

23:00.747 --> 23:02.480
Sabrina forgot about
the corn silk.

23:02.482 --> 23:04.515
We were gonna use it
as the thatching on the roof.

23:04.517 --> 23:05.583
They're destroyed.

23:05.585 --> 23:08.319
-We can't use this.
-We can't use it?

23:08.321 --> 23:10.755
-We don't have time for this.
-Just use something else.

23:10.757 --> 23:12.289
We don't have time
to make anything else.

23:12.291 --> 23:14.458
This house has to look
like a viking hut.

23:14.460 --> 23:15.726
We're gonna have to come up
with something quick

23:15.728 --> 23:17.228
if we want to make it work.

23:17.230 --> 23:19.897
Instead of the corn husk, we're
gonna use this little mold.

23:19.899 --> 23:22.466
Sabrina has this idea to just
do the roof in fondant,

23:22.468 --> 23:23.667
and pressing a mold into it,

23:23.669 --> 23:25.169
that's gonna give it
that thatched look.

23:25.171 --> 23:26.837
That corn would have
put us over the top.

23:26.839 --> 23:28.339
We're gonna make do
without it.

23:28.341 --> 23:31.008
I'm not gonna let some stupid
corn send me home for $50,000.

23:31.010 --> 23:32.910
Easy now, you guys.
The sugar is on it.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.578
Careful, I don't
want this to drop.

23:34.580 --> 23:38.482
Our story is King Arthur opens
a door to a trick-or-treater

23:38.484 --> 23:40.684
and realizes it's not
a trick-or-treater after all,

23:40.686 --> 23:41.819
but a ghost.

23:41.821 --> 23:42.953
-So you want him to look --
-Stoic.

23:42.955 --> 23:44.121
Stoic, okay.

23:44.123 --> 23:45.423
Yeah, but he's got to look
a bit shocked, right?

23:45.425 --> 23:47.425
Stoically shocked,
is that a thing?

23:47.427 --> 23:48.959
Sure.
We'll make that a thing.

23:48.961 --> 23:51.495
Arlen moves on to sculpting
King Arthur's face,

23:51.497 --> 23:56.033
creating a strong bone structure
that is regal enough for a king.

23:56.035 --> 23:58.869
I'm not sure how big
we need this fabric.

23:58.871 --> 24:00.404
I'll just make,
like, three layers

24:00.406 --> 24:01.739
and hope that it's enough.

24:01.741 --> 24:03.040
I want to show
the skull's features

24:03.042 --> 24:04.341
and the only way to do that

24:04.343 --> 24:06.911
is with this
super-thin edible fabric.

24:06.913 --> 24:09.013
I'm ripping a little bit
to add some texture.

24:09.015 --> 24:11.115
I kind of like that better
than it straight.

24:11.117 --> 24:12.583
This is an optical illusion.

24:12.585 --> 24:14.752
That ghost is floating
in midair.

24:14.754 --> 24:16.754
King Arthur just came
from a war,

24:16.756 --> 24:19.523
and his swords
all got twisted up.

24:19.525 --> 24:21.325
That okay, part of our story?

24:21.327 --> 24:23.194

33:33.846 --> 33:35.846
-Dry ice.
-Dry ice is coming.

33:35.848 --> 33:37.147
No dry ice.

33:37.149 --> 33:39.683
We're using dry ice
like a cool engine effect,

33:39.685 --> 33:41.685
but Shelby is worried
that the dry ice

33:41.687 --> 33:43.387
is gonna melt the sugar.

33:43.389 --> 33:46.523
I have a friend who delivered
a cake with dry ice in a box,

33:46.525 --> 33:48.291
and the cake was completely
melted by the time

33:48.293 --> 33:49.926
it got two hours away.

33:49.928 --> 33:51.294
I am not losing 50 grand.

33:51.296 --> 33:52.596
Yeah, that's why I don't want
everything to melt.

33:52.598 --> 33:54.931
I broke my [bleep].
I am not losing $50,000.

33:54.933 --> 33:56.767
Lenny and Shelby
are at it again.

33:56.769 --> 33:58.268
Lenny is, like,
this stress ball,

33:58.270 --> 34:00.537
and Shelby is like
this puffy cloud.

34:00.539 --> 34:02.739
I just don't want
everything to melt.
Look.

34:02.741 --> 34:04.975
What's gonna melt?
I'm putting it right here.

34:04.977 --> 34:07.344
There's no sugar
around me at all.
This is all sugar!

34:07.346 --> 34:09.980
This could be
the $50,000 mistake.

34:09.982 --> 34:11.381
It doesn't go up.
It goes out.

34:11.383 --> 34:12.449
It goes down and out.

34:12.451 --> 34:14.184
-It goes down and out?
-Down and out.

34:14.186 --> 34:15.919
-Yeah.
-Okay, fine.

34:15.921 --> 34:18.989
I'm actually worried about
my cake falling apart.

34:18.991 --> 34:20.791
-One minute left!
-One minute, everybody!

34:20.793 --> 34:22.059
Let's go, push!

34:22.061 --> 34:24.694
-Go, go, go, go.
-Okay, guys. Here we go.

34:24.696 --> 34:26.096
LENNY: This is 50 grand
we're staring at here.

34:26.098 --> 34:28.098
Okay, sword is coming.
Fix to his hand.

34:28.100 --> 34:30.767
When Orly attached Excalibur,
he kind of crushed

34:30.769 --> 34:32.235
King Arthur's hand.

34:32.237 --> 34:34.004
I don't think Arlen's gonna
have time to go

34:34.006 --> 34:35.338
and add that detail back.

34:35.340 --> 34:37.307
Beautiful, what do we need?
What else do we need?

34:37.309 --> 34:38.608
Let's play with this fire.

34:38.610 --> 34:40.310
Remember last time
the flashing lights,

34:40.312 --> 34:41.378
didn't they, you know, like...

34:41.380 --> 34:43.046
Cynthia, the back is falling.

34:43.048 --> 34:44.648
What back? Oh, my god.

34:44.650 --> 34:47.284
10, 9, 8,

34:47.286 --> 34:50.454
7, 6, 5,

34:50.456 --> 34:54.658
4, 3, 2, 1,

34:54.660 --> 34:56.193
Hands off your displays!

34:56.195 --> 34:58.795
-Whoo!
-Yeah.

34:58.797 --> 35:01.398
-That was rough.
-That was so rough.

35:01.400 --> 35:03.567
I'm pretty happy with it.
Are you guys?

35:03.569 --> 35:06.636
-I think it's what we imagined.
-Yep.

35:06.638 --> 35:14.778
♪♪

35:14.780 --> 35:16.413
In this Spine Chiller challenge,

35:16.415 --> 35:18.281
the judges wanted you
to take them on a ride

35:18.283 --> 35:20.383
into the past or the future

35:20.385 --> 35:22.486
with Halloween time travel.

35:22.488 --> 35:24.688
Candied Cadavers,
let's talk about your display.

35:24.690 --> 35:26.490
CYNTHIA: King Arthur
gets a trick-or-treater.

35:26.492 --> 35:29.459
He answers his castle door,
and he sees a little ghost,

35:29.461 --> 35:31.862
but he realizes that
the ghost has no legs,

35:31.864 --> 35:34.131
so he pulls on the sheet
and realizes,

35:34.133 --> 35:35.732
it's not a trick
or treater after all.

35:35.734 --> 35:37.868
The pumpkin elements
are the gargoyles.

35:37.870 --> 35:41.771
The king is made of cake
and rice cereal treats.

35:41.773 --> 35:44.207
The sugar elements
are the chains,

35:44.209 --> 35:46.276
the eyes on the king,

35:46.278 --> 35:49.813
the candy, the bag,
and the stained-glass windows.

35:49.815 --> 35:53.283
Our tasting element, lemon-mint
white chocolate ganache

35:53.285 --> 35:57.020
on a milk chocolate roll
and cocoa powder.

35:57.022 --> 35:59.823
It's a flavor that just kept
evolving and evolving,

35:59.825 --> 36:03.126
and I think the lemon
and the mint completely elevated

36:03.128 --> 36:04.327
the weight
of the white chocolate,

36:04.329 --> 36:07.631
so it was a really
delightful bite.

36:07.633 --> 36:09.332
This ghost, the fact
that you created

36:09.334 --> 36:11.268
this out of gelatin sheets,

36:11.270 --> 36:13.303
it's absolutely stunning.

36:13.305 --> 36:16.673
Orly, the stained glass
pieces are so great.

36:16.675 --> 36:18.875
I love the details
you put in the sword.

36:18.877 --> 36:21.878
Now, you put the chains in while
the sugar was still warm,

36:21.880 --> 36:23.413
so it was a little bit droopy.

36:23.415 --> 36:25.582
That I can definitely see.

36:25.584 --> 36:28.218
I love the gargoyles.
I think that's a great touch,

36:28.220 --> 36:30.053
lot of expression
in their faces.

36:30.055 --> 36:32.722
The face on King Arthur
feels very period

36:32.724 --> 36:34.391
which is really cool,

36:34.393 --> 36:38.528
but the hands feel a little bit
rushed and a little unfinished.

36:38.530 --> 36:41.298
We've seen a lot of sugar
waters in these competitions.

36:41.300 --> 36:43.133
Sometimes the water
looks amazing.

36:43.135 --> 36:45.168
This feels a little bit rushed.

36:45.170 --> 36:46.503
Arthur stands out.

36:46.505 --> 36:49.306
His cap against his shirt,
the way his face is made,

36:49.308 --> 36:50.907
even the crown, like,
the way it's tilted,

36:50.909 --> 36:53.443
it's very theatrical
and very fun to look at.

36:53.445 --> 36:56.379
-Candied Cadavers, thank you.
-Thanks, guys.

36:56.381 --> 36:58.281
Monsters of Mayhem, you're up.

36:58.283 --> 36:59.649
It's Halloween night.

36:59.651 --> 37:03.353
We have a mischievous viking
who chose trick over treat

37:03.355 --> 37:07.290
and decided to egg their house
and smash their pumpkins.

37:07.292 --> 37:09.226
Our cake piece
is the viking guy.

37:09.228 --> 37:12.062
Our pumpkin elements are
the mischievous viking,

37:12.064 --> 37:14.965
the big rock, the smashed
jack-o-lanterns,

37:14.967 --> 37:16.399
and these fire logs.

37:16.401 --> 37:21.171
We have sugar eggs, sugar river,
and the sugar flames.

37:21.173 --> 37:23.373
So for our tasting element,
chocolate pavê

37:23.375 --> 37:26.243
with maple honey marshmallow
with a graham cracker sablé.

37:26.245 --> 37:28.678
It's so yummy and light.

37:28.680 --> 37:30.547
You know, I didn't actually
really taste the maple

37:30.549 --> 37:33.283
or the honey in the marshmallow,
but that doesn't really matter

37:33.285 --> 37:36.086
because the flavor
was so well balanced.
[ Mouths words ]

37:36.088 --> 37:38.888
The dry brushing on the house
in the back is gorgeous.

37:38.890 --> 37:40.824
It looks like real woodgrain.

37:40.826 --> 37:44.961
Sabrina, your faces are
so perfect, so smooth.

37:44.963 --> 37:46.196
Thank you.

37:46.198 --> 37:48.598
The body, though, of your
viking is really static.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.868
I've seen much more
dynamic figures from you.

37:51.870 --> 37:54.771
I love the idea of the eggs.
They look like real eggs.

37:54.773 --> 37:58.208
Those sugar flames and the logs,
the smashed pumpkins,

37:58.210 --> 37:59.776
there's a lot
of great things in here,

37:59.778 --> 38:02.312
but I don't know that that's
enough to really give us

38:02.314 --> 38:04.114
the Halloween theme.

38:04.116 --> 38:06.182
There's a little bit
of a disconnect

38:06.184 --> 38:07.751
between the two characters.

38:07.753 --> 38:09.519
Although there's a lot
of character in it,

38:09.521 --> 38:10.854
it feels less finished

38:10.856 --> 38:12.789
than your really
refined character

38:12.791 --> 38:14.391
on the right side.

38:14.393 --> 38:16.192
The backdrop,
it looks beautiful.

38:16.194 --> 38:17.527
My favorite part of this
piece, though,

38:17.529 --> 38:18.862
is the logs and the fire.

38:18.864 --> 38:20.096
It looks so clean.

38:20.098 --> 38:23.466
Monsters of Mayhem,
thank you very much.

38:23.468 --> 38:24.868
Zesty Zombies.

38:24.870 --> 38:27.304
SHELBY: This is a story
of time and space.

38:27.306 --> 38:30.273
The human, in his rocket ship,
crashed down,

38:30.275 --> 38:34.978
and he taught the local aliens
about our traditional Halloween.

38:34.980 --> 38:38.114
So the sugar elements,
the little galaxy pools,

38:38.116 --> 38:41.151
the pumpkin element is this
big old monster right here,

38:41.153 --> 38:42.819
and all the moon rocks

38:42.821 --> 38:45.689
and the big,
giant rocket ship cake.

38:45.691 --> 38:48.325
What I made for you guys
is a moon sugar cookie

38:48.327 --> 38:49.359
dipped in chocolate,

38:49.361 --> 38:50.694
and then I put it
on a silpat mat

38:50.696 --> 38:52.095
to make it look like a moon.

38:52.097 --> 38:54.831
I'm guessing you didn't
taste your pastry

38:54.833 --> 38:57.634
before you
gave it to us, correct?

38:57.636 --> 38:59.736
Oh, no.

38:59.738 --> 39:03.406
You got to.

39:03.408 --> 39:05.909
I think you swapped out
the sugar for salt.

39:05.911 --> 39:09.212
Oh, my god. Ew.

39:09.214 --> 39:11.114
I'm having a hard time
getting it out of my mouth.

39:11.116 --> 39:13.550
I feel like I just
swallowed the ocean.

39:13.552 --> 39:15.785
My stomach starts turning.

39:15.787 --> 39:19.956
Salt in her cookie,
this is a deadly mistake.

39:19.958 --> 39:22.459
Lenny, this is
a great character.

39:22.461 --> 39:24.761
The eyes are incredible.

39:24.763 --> 39:27.497
I can see every little bit
in the detail,

39:27.499 --> 39:30.600
and that cake is gigantic.

39:30.602 --> 39:33.370
It's settling a little bit,
as cake does.

39:33.372 --> 39:35.138
Definitely think a little bit
more about weight

39:35.140 --> 39:36.940
and dowels within the cake.

39:36.942 --> 39:40.343
The moon has a 3D look.
There's craters. There's depth.

39:40.345 --> 39:43.646
You airbrushed all this stuff,
and it just came to life.

39:43.648 --> 39:46.082
You have mad painting skills.

39:46.084 --> 39:47.450
Thank you.

39:47.452 --> 39:48.985
Lenny, I would've liked
to have seen this character

39:48.987 --> 39:50.353
a little bit more towards us

39:50.355 --> 39:52.122
so we can see
the detail in his face,

39:52.124 --> 39:55.058
and to maybe bring that other
character who looks so cool

39:55.060 --> 39:58.027
out to the foreground a little
bit more so we can see it.

39:58.029 --> 40:00.430
The alien creatures,
they're not generic in any way.

40:00.432 --> 40:02.365
They're so original.
They're fun.

40:02.367 --> 40:04.534
They look like they
would be kids.

40:04.536 --> 40:06.336
Zesty Zombies, thank you.

40:06.338 --> 40:08.705
The judges are now gonna use
their collective wisdom

40:08.707 --> 40:11.307
of the past, center themselves
in the present,

40:11.309 --> 40:13.410
and decide your futures.

40:13.412 --> 40:15.779
We'll meet you right back here
with a decision.

40:15.781 --> 40:17.847
I am nervous.

40:17.849 --> 40:22.285
A chance to make it
to the finale and $50,000

40:22.287 --> 40:23.987
is on the line here.

40:23.989 --> 40:27.056
That cookie could really
be salt on the wound.

40:27.058 --> 40:29.592
We could be going home.

40:32.264 --> 40:36.466
Judges, three great displays
with Halloween time travel.

40:36.468 --> 40:38.034
You have a tough
decision to make.

40:38.036 --> 40:41.037
There's just new surprises
in every little piece.

40:41.039 --> 40:42.672
Let's talk about
the Zesty Zombies.

40:42.674 --> 40:44.574
Zesty Zombies came up
with something

40:44.576 --> 40:45.842
that I haven't seen before.

40:45.844 --> 40:47.777
I love the funness of it.

40:47.779 --> 40:50.313
They kind of look like
they're moving almost.

40:50.315 --> 40:52.782
Lenny did the best pumpkin.

40:52.784 --> 40:55.518
I can just look into
those eyes forever.

40:55.520 --> 40:57.587
TUCKER: And Shelby,
I didn't realize she was

40:57.589 --> 40:58.955
such a great airbrush artist.

40:58.957 --> 41:00.490
I don't know why
I didn't see that before.

41:00.492 --> 41:03.960
LI: That cake must be, like,
200 pounds in that spaceship.

41:03.962 --> 41:05.628
I do see some settling

41:05.630 --> 41:07.230
where you can see
the ripples of the fondant --

41:07.232 --> 41:08.398
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

41:08.400 --> 41:09.699
...but it's almost
impossible to see.

41:09.701 --> 41:12.769
We need to talk
about the tasting.

41:12.771 --> 41:14.070
Oh, my god. Ew.

41:14.072 --> 41:17.440
She used salt!
This has never happened before.

41:17.442 --> 41:20.844
The fatal mistake here is she
didn't taste her tasting first.

41:20.846 --> 41:22.011
Right.

41:22.013 --> 41:23.079
BENNETT: Let's talk about
Candied Cadavers.

41:23.081 --> 41:24.681
The ghost is suspended
in their air.

41:24.683 --> 41:25.915
It literally looks like
it's floating,

41:25.917 --> 41:27.350
extremely cool
how they did that.

41:27.352 --> 41:30.286
I love the colors of Arthur.
The sword is amazing.

41:30.288 --> 41:32.789
Orly really pulled it through
with all the sugar work.

41:32.791 --> 41:34.390
At this point,
he's just showing off, you know?

41:34.392 --> 41:36.359
-Yeah, right.
-Mm-hmm.

41:36.361 --> 41:38.928
And although there's not a lot
of pumpkin elements on there,

41:38.930 --> 41:41.764
Arlen really showed us
what he can do with that face.

41:41.766 --> 41:43.032
That face was...

41:43.034 --> 41:44.267
I didn't realize he could
sculpt like that.

41:44.269 --> 41:46.836
LI: Orly took the time
to actually infuse

41:46.838 --> 41:49.172
fresh mint into the treat --
-Mm-hmm.

41:49.174 --> 41:50.673
...and it made
all the difference.

41:50.675 --> 41:52.876
I could've had 10 of those.

41:52.878 --> 41:55.545
BENNETT: And then we have
Monsters of Mayhem.

41:55.547 --> 41:58.414
She's got a real gift
for creating

41:58.416 --> 42:00.216
absolutely perfect skin.

42:00.218 --> 42:02.519
My favorite part about
the piece was the campfire.

42:02.521 --> 42:05.088
Those logs made out of pumpkin
look super cool.

42:05.090 --> 42:08.725
Now, where they suffered
is time management issues.

42:08.727 --> 42:10.793
They had some really
interesting elements

42:10.795 --> 42:13.463
behind that giant
pumpkin boulder.

42:13.465 --> 42:15.698
The arm was lost,
and the hammer, actually,

42:15.700 --> 42:16.866
I think should be

42:16.868 --> 42:18.735
the most threatening
element of this piece.

42:18.737 --> 42:21.304
I feel like they lost
the theme on this one.

42:21.306 --> 42:23.873
Eggs on the door
and the little bit of pumpkin

42:23.875 --> 42:26.142
they they have on the ground
just doesn't read

42:26.144 --> 42:27.544
Halloween piece to me.

42:27.546 --> 42:29.946
I love the tasting element.

42:29.948 --> 42:32.749
Cesar took the time to actually
torch the marshmallow

42:32.751 --> 42:34.817
before placing
the sablé on top.

42:34.819 --> 42:36.653
That was such a great touch.

42:36.655 --> 42:38.922
Two teams make it
into the finale,

42:38.924 --> 42:41.024
and one team is
going to go home.

42:41.026 --> 42:42.158
Do we know who it is?

42:42.160 --> 42:43.693
-This one's tough.
-It's very tough.

42:43.695 --> 42:44.894
I think we got it, though.

42:44.896 --> 42:46.095
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

42:46.097 --> 42:48.131
All right.
Let's bring back our teams.

42:48.133 --> 42:51.634
♪♪

42:51.636 --> 42:54.771
Six phenomenal teams
entered this competition,

42:54.773 --> 42:58.575
but you three teams have
taken them out one by one,

42:58.577 --> 43:00.109
and in just a few moments,

43:00.111 --> 43:02.545
one of you will join them
in the graveyard.

43:02.547 --> 43:04.948
The other two will move on
to the finale

43:04.950 --> 43:08.017
and fight for $50,000.

43:08.019 --> 43:10.320
The stakes have
never been higher.

43:10.322 --> 43:12.355
Even with three
displays so strong,

43:12.357 --> 43:14.090
the judges felt
there was one of you

43:14.092 --> 43:16.926
that edged out the rest
with the cleanest details

43:16.928 --> 43:19.829
and a seriously delicious treat.

43:19.831 --> 43:23.333
The first team to earn their way
into the "Halloween Wars"

43:23.335 --> 43:24.667
finale is...

43:24.669 --> 43:28.504
♪♪

43:28.506 --> 43:30.873
Candied Cadavers.
Congratulations.

43:30.875 --> 43:33.743
Your gravity-defying ghost
sealed the deal.

43:33.745 --> 43:37.347
CYNTHIA: I am crying literal
tears of joy.

43:37.349 --> 43:40.249
We made it to the finales!
Aah!

43:40.251 --> 43:42.085
That leaves Zesty Zombies

43:42.087 --> 43:44.320
and Monsters of Mayhem.

43:44.322 --> 43:46.222
Your perfectly torched
maple s'mores

43:46.224 --> 43:48.091
were the best treat of the day.

43:48.093 --> 43:52.595
Overall, the look of your design
didn't quite scream Halloween.

43:52.597 --> 43:55.365
Zesty Zombies, the judges
loved your alien

43:55.367 --> 43:57.300
trick or treaters
made of pumpkin.

43:57.302 --> 43:58.468
What they didn't love?

43:58.470 --> 44:01.404
You used salt instead
of sugar in your cookie!

44:01.406 --> 44:03.439
It's the moment of truth.

44:03.441 --> 44:05.942
Who stays and who goes?

44:05.944 --> 44:09.679
We took a risk and did something
super big and we pulled it off,

44:09.681 --> 44:12.415
but that cookie could
really take us out.

44:12.417 --> 44:15.451
Up until this point, I hadn't
even thought about the $50,000,

44:15.453 --> 44:16.886
but now that we're here,

44:16.888 --> 44:19.989
I think I really want
to get that for our team.

44:19.991 --> 44:23.259
Zesty Zombies,

44:23.261 --> 44:24.627
you're in the finale.

44:24.629 --> 44:26.229
Congratulations.

44:26.231 --> 44:28.631
I'm sorry, Monsters of Mayhem.

44:28.633 --> 44:31.567
You're done in this
"Halloween Wars." Thank you.

44:31.569 --> 44:33.870
I accept the judges' decision,
but I really disagree,

44:33.872 --> 44:35.705
and I actually feel sorry
that they're not gonna be

44:35.707 --> 44:37.106
able to see what
Monsters of Mayhem

44:37.108 --> 44:39.208
could've done in the finale.

44:39.210 --> 44:42.445
Teams, the next time you step
foot in this kitchen,

44:42.447 --> 44:44.080
you will be facing off,

44:44.082 --> 44:49.752
and someone will walk out
of here with $50,000.

44:49.754 --> 44:50.953
Good luck.

44:50.955 --> 44:53.356
It's now down to just us
and Zesty Zombies.

44:53.358 --> 44:54.857
We're gonna win this thing.

44:54.859 --> 44:56.092
Going into the finale,

44:56.094 --> 44:57.860
we need to stop the small,
little bickering.
