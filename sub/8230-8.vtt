we hit the bad guy.

did the pure ice cannonball

10:13.500 --> 10:16.366

10:16.367 --> 10:18.899
That means if we aim our Cannon
just a little bit up,

we could have traveled
an incredible distance.

couldn't part the frozen water.

10:35.500 --> 10:36.467
Sorry, my friend.

10:36.468 --> 10:37.866
I guess we underestimated
the ice.

10:37.867 --> 10:41.266
And such an impressive result
means the myth can proceed

10:41.267 --> 10:44.466

1,550 miles per hour,

11:22.833 --> 11:27.299
the ice has exceeded
all expectations.

11:27.300 --> 11:29.732
Look, this is
a totally unexpected result.

11:29.733 --> 11:32.932
I mean, none of us ever thought
that a pure ice cannonball

11:32.933 --> 11:35.133
could survive being shot out
of a Cannon.

11:36.733 --> 11:39.732
Especially since we had tested
the ice bullet way back when

11:39.733 --> 11:40.932
and every time
we shot that bullet,

11:40.933 --> 11:43.166
the ice just turned
into water vapor.

11:43.167 --> 11:45.232
So, i figured that's
what was gonna happen

11:45.233 --> 11:47.166
with the ice cannonball,
but it didn't!

11:47.167 --> 11:50.632

Jamie the paddle says...

12:07.333 --> 12:09.832
Bam!

12:09.833 --> 12:12.532
We've effectively been
attempting to weaponize

12:12.533 --> 12:14.432
the one-tenth of an ounce
ping-pong ball

12:14.433 --> 12:15.932
and make it lethal.

12:15.933 --> 12:18.799
So we started out smacking them
with rackets as hard as we can

12:18.800 --> 12:21.799
and came up with about 75 miles
per hour off the racket.

12:21.800 --> 12:24.766
So, i built this little baby
right here, and at 90 p.S.I.,

12:29.467 --> 12:31.799

into a bar and says...

12:56.533 --> 12:57.966
So, why the long barrel?

12:57.967 --> 13:00.666
Well, as long as the pressure
behind the ball

13:00.667 --> 13:02.866
is greater than the pressure
in front of the ball,

to accelerate.

the barrel we have,

will have to do that,

of 12, 16, and 20 inches.

16:03.367 --> 16:05.332
Too thin, and it'll explode.

16:05.333 --> 16:09.166

structurally prohibitive

to move around.

16:10.467 --> 16:13.766
All right, so now that the tubes
are filled up with water,

16:13.767 --> 16:15.132
we just need to let them freeze,

16:15.133 --> 16:18.066
and then we'll have
our breeches.

16:23.433 --> 16:24.932
This is gonna be fun.

16:24.933 --> 16:28.966
So, we now know that half a
pound of black powder is enough

16:28.967 --> 16:33.232
to propel our ice cannonball
at 680 miles per hour,

16:33.233 --> 16:35.766

enough range and enough damage

wall, and an 8-inch wall.

properties of ice,

the smallest breech

17:41.200 --> 17:44.066
that can contain the blast
will be the best option.

and no projectile,

17:47.067 --> 17:49.766

17:49.767 --> 17:53.199

looking good for the myth.

18:18.267 --> 18:19.332
But you know what?

18:19.333 --> 18:21.266
Maybe we're using
too much black powder.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.966
Maybe we need to find the
perfect amount of black powder

18:23.967 --> 18:27.367
to launch the cannonball
and not destroy our Cannon.

18:28.867 --> 18:33.066
Narrator: So, with a few more
freshly frozen 20-inch breeches,

18:33.067 --> 18:36.466
the team decides
a little less boom is required

18:36.467 --> 18:37.832
and not more ice.

18:37.833 --> 18:41.099
Now, the reason that we're going
with less gunpowder

18:41.100 --> 18:43.166
rather than thicker ice
is twofold.

18:43.167 --> 18:45.166
See, what tends to happen
with ice

18:45.167 --> 18:48.599
is that the outer layer
insulates the inner layer,

18:48.600 --> 18:50.566
so the core never really
freezes solid.

18:50.567 --> 18:54.899
The second reason is that when
you get to ridiculous-size ice,

18:54.900 --> 18:56.932
it becomes unwieldy...

18:56.933 --> 18:59.332

So, we'll get out
our 20-inch breeches...

Voilà.

19:04.568 --> 19:06.066
Lower the gunpowder,

19:06.067 --> 19:09.299
and see if we can get a speed
that is potentially deadly.

19:09.300 --> 19:11.899
Narrator: They're scaling down
the black powder

19:11.900 --> 19:15.966
from 8 to a mere 1.25 ounces.

19:15.967 --> 19:18.899
If the 20-inch breech
can't handle this...

19:18.900 --> 19:20.499
All right, our Cannon is hot.

19:20.500 --> 19:22.832
The myth is surely busted.

19:25.067 --> 19:27.666
Grant: I think it did it.
It worked!

19:27.667 --> 19:30.499
We shot the plug out
without blowing up the breech!

19:30.500 --> 19:34.066
Narrator: It was a somewhat
less-than-big boom,

19:34.067 --> 19:35.399
but it's a start.

19:35.400 --> 19:36.932
Kari:
Our breech hasn't exploded.

19:36.933 --> 19:38.932
It's still intact,
which means it's reusable.

19:38.933 --> 19:41.332
We're gonna keep going.
1.75 is next.

Whoa!

19:51.533 --> 19:53.799
Narrator:
Now, that was more aggressive.

19:53.800 --> 19:57.466
But can a brand-new breech
contain 2 ounces?

19:57.467 --> 20:01.233
2 ounces, in three, two, one.

20:02.233 --> 20:05.199
Tory: Oh. All right, it looks
like that was too much.

20:05.200 --> 20:06.766
I guess
one and three-quarter ounces,

20:06.767 --> 20:07.833
that's the perfect amount.

20:09.500 --> 20:12.432
Yeah,
two is just a bit too much.

20:12.433 --> 20:15.399
Grant:
So, we've got the ball.

20:15.400 --> 20:17.166
We've got the amount
of black powder.

20:17.167 --> 20:18.432
We've got the size
of the breech.

20:18.433 --> 20:19.966
You know what that means.

20:19.967 --> 20:23.732
That means it's time to build a
full-size Cannon and go for it.

Narrator: Adam and Jamie have
a super-sized ping-pong popgun,

to use it.

But while shooting

they determined the resulting
destruction is less than lethal.

So, what next?

It might break a rib,
but it's not gonna kill you.

21:05.900 --> 21:08.766

Well, Adam has chanced upon

21:08.767 --> 21:12.532
a cutting-edge resource
called the, er, Internet...

21:12.533 --> 21:14.832
That's amazing.

21:14.833 --> 21:16.432
It turns out
that physics teachers

21:16.433 --> 21:18.332
have been getting
incredible acceleration

21:18.333 --> 21:19.333
out of ping-pong balls

21:19.334 --> 21:21.432
without using
80-foot-long barrels.

21:21.433 --> 21:23.099
And i think it's a method

21:23.100 --> 21:25.799
that we should investigate
immediately.

21:25.800 --> 21:28.832
Okay, cool,
it's working all right.

21:28.833 --> 21:30.732
What they've been doing is,

21:30.733 --> 21:34.066
they've been taking
a 36-inch-long tube of pvc,

21:34.067 --> 21:36.866
and they've been putting
a ping-pong ball in one end.

21:36.867 --> 21:40.732
Then, they put packing tape
over each end of the tube

21:40.733 --> 21:45.066
and they use a vacuum to draw
a full vacuum in that tube.

21:45.067 --> 21:46.466
Okay.

21:46.467 --> 21:49.866
Here we go.
Pulling the vacuum.

21:49.867 --> 21:52.399
Then, when they Pierce
that side, of course,

21:52.400 --> 21:54.732
air wants to rush in
to fill the vacuum,

21:54.733 --> 21:56.132
but the ping-pong ball's
in the way.

21:56.133 --> 21:57.599
So, it starts to move forward.

21:57.600 --> 22:00.766
Just, everyone back off
a little bit.

22:00.767 --> 22:03.666
There's nothing in its way
in terms of air

22:03.667 --> 22:05.366
because there's a vacuum.

22:05.367 --> 22:07.766
And so, it bursts
out of this side

22:07.767 --> 22:11.266
at something
over 300 miles per hour.

22:36.067 --> 22:37.432
[ Air Cannon firing ]

22:37.433 --> 22:41.699
Popping the sealed vacuum caused
a sudden influx of air,

and the pressure differential
sends the ball rocketing.

Well, the vacuum trick
for launching a ping-pong ball

out of a short length of tubing
is working gangbusters.

Something's not working.

24:18.468 --> 24:19.732
[ Air Cannon firing ]

24:19.733 --> 24:21.799
But it's reaching close
to the end of our tube,

24:21.800 --> 24:23.966
and then somehow bouncing back
a little.

24:23.967 --> 24:25.332
Well, not somehow.

24:25.333 --> 24:28.532
See, air rushes in this tube
behind the ping-pong ball.

24:28.533 --> 24:30.066
There's a vacuum in front of it.

24:30.067 --> 24:32.232
But that air sneaks past
the ping-pong ball,

24:32.233 --> 24:34.332
and it looks like
it's providing a cushion

24:34.333 --> 24:35.599
that's actually causing it
to spring back

24:35.600 --> 24:37.132
once it reaches the end.

24:37.133 --> 24:40.099
So, it's not attaining enough
speed or momentum to bust out.

Adam: Nope.

24:42.433 --> 24:44.132
Didn't make it.

24:44.133 --> 24:47.199
That tells me that we've made
this tube too long.

24:47.200 --> 24:50.432
Narrator: Yep, that cushion
of air decelerates the ball

24:50.433 --> 24:53.799
to the point that it doesn't
have the force

24:53.800 --> 24:55.699
to pop the packing tape.

So, as Brody wouldn't say,
they need a shorter barrel.

The question is how short?

It's only coming out of

The shorter barrel means

38:10.767 --> 38:12.932
But for something that hasn't
been done in 300 years,

38:12.933 --> 38:14.066
that's pretty good.

38:14.067 --> 38:15.932
Narrator:
Not just pretty good.

38:15.933 --> 38:20.099
The team successfully fired
a Cannon made of water.

38:20.100 --> 38:23.132
But according
to their strict criteria,

38:23.133 --> 38:25.566
it's not yet successful.

38:25.567 --> 38:28.766
Well, i know the cannonball made
it all the way to the guys,

38:28.767 --> 38:30.799
but I'm hoping this time,
it actually does some damage.

38:30.800 --> 38:33.499
So when you're talking
about the damage

38:33.500 --> 38:35.232
that a cannonball can cause,

38:35.233 --> 38:36.566
you're talking
about kinetic energy.

38:36.567 --> 38:41.566
Kinetic energy depends on
two things, mass and velocity.

38:41.567 --> 38:43.799
Now, the mass is determined
by the ball itself.

38:43.800 --> 38:46.132
So if we want
more kinetic energy,

38:46.133 --> 38:49.266
what we need to do
is increase the velocity.

38:49.267 --> 38:51.066
Now, under normal circumstances,

38:51.067 --> 38:53.599
all you'd need to do is add
more black powder,

38:53.600 --> 38:54.966
and it comes out faster.

38:54.967 --> 38:57.066
But the more black powder
we put in,

38:57.067 --> 38:59.632
the greater risk
of destroying the Cannon itself

38:59.633 --> 39:01.399
before we get a lethal shot.

39:01.400 --> 39:04.466
Narrator: So with the same
amount of black powder

39:04.467 --> 39:06.166
and a tweaked trajectory...

39:06.167 --> 39:07.232
We are hot.

39:07.233 --> 39:09.832
Will the ice-cold Cannon
this time

39:09.833 --> 39:11.532
be an ice-cold killer?

39:11.533 --> 39:16.533
This is the ice Cannon,
in three, two, one!

39:18.367 --> 39:21.632
Grant and Tory: Aw.

39:21.633 --> 39:25.199
Narrator: The answer is... No.

39:25.200 --> 39:27.832
Although the ball more
than covered the distance,

39:27.833 --> 39:30.199
sailing over the heads
of the targets,

39:30.200 --> 39:33.499
this myth is on the rocks.

39:33.500 --> 39:34.866
[ Laughing ]
I like this.

39:34.867 --> 39:36.866
I'm gonna start
crushing my ice this way.

39:36.867 --> 39:38.566
Mixing fire and ice

39:38.567 --> 39:42.299
was never likely to be
a dangerous cocktail.

39:42.300 --> 39:44.699
But given the severe limitations
of the material,

39:44.700 --> 39:47.499
it was an incredible effort
of ingenuity.

39:47.500 --> 39:52.132
This is the myth that was almost
plausible so many times.

39:52.133 --> 39:54.232
It was looking so good
in the beginning.

39:54.233 --> 39:56.333
We started out
with our ice cannonballs.

39:57.967 --> 39:59.499
Fired out of a real Cannon
at high speed.

39:59.500 --> 40:00.666
Then we went to the breeches,

40:00.667 --> 40:02.999
and we found a breech size
that would hold

40:03.000 --> 40:05.432
a reasonable amount
of black powder.

40:05.433 --> 40:08.832
We put the whole thing together,
built a full-size Cannon,

40:08.833 --> 40:11.232
brought it out here
to face our army.

40:11.233 --> 40:13.999
And it was, again,
looking very promising.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.699
But unfortunately,

40:15.700 --> 40:18.632
on the one that would've caused
the most damage,

40:18.633 --> 40:20.932
which is the one that sailed
over the army's heads

40:20.933 --> 40:22.232
and hit the wall,

40:22.233 --> 40:24.732
that's the one where the Cannon
itself exploded.

40:24.733 --> 40:27.566
And for this myth
to be plausible,

40:27.567 --> 40:33.066
we have to have damage and range
and reusability all in one.

40:33.067 --> 40:34.232
And that just never happened.

40:34.233 --> 40:36.232
So, unfortunately,

40:36.233 --> 40:38.332
i think we have to
bust this one.

40:38.333 --> 40:40.999
And I'm not happy about it.

fast enough... To be fatal.

the world-record-breaking ball

bounce harmlessly off the butt

if you had asked me beforehand,

i would've told you that
i thought the ping-pong ball

42:26.500 --> 42:28.832
was going to bounce
right off of the pig.

42:28.833 --> 42:30.966

of the two objects was such

42:30.967 --> 42:34.099
that the ball really wouldn't do
that much damage.

I am shocked
by how much damage it did.

call that this a non-lethal hit.
