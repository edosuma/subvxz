00:12.125 --> 00:15.083
<i>I grew up on</i>
<i>the Sunshine Coast in Australia,</i>

00:15.166 --> 00:17.458
<i>which means my family and I</i>
<i>were never far from the ocean.</i>

00:18.375 --> 00:20.750
<i>If we weren't in it, we were on it.</i>

00:21.333 --> 00:23.666
<i>We practically lived</i>
<i>on our boat, Home Abroad.</i>

00:24.458 --> 00:28.291
<i>It was a tight fit,</i>
<i>Mum, Dad, and the four of us kids,</i>

00:28.375 --> 00:30.750
<i>but we were happy</i>
<i>because we were together.</i>

00:32.750 --> 00:36.833
<i>At night, Mum would tell us</i>
<i>stories about a starman in the sky,</i>

00:36.916 --> 00:39.208
<i>then the waves would rock us to sleep.</i>

00:41.708 --> 00:44.458
<i>I'll never forget</i>
<i>the first time I sailed by myself,</i>

00:44.958 --> 00:48.250
<i>the rush of excitement</i>
<i>when my sail caught the wind,</i>

00:48.333 --> 00:50.500
<i>the magic and the allure of the sea.</i>

00:51.000 --> 00:54.333
<i>I was the captain</i>
<i>and the whole world was in front of me,</i>

00:54.416 --> 00:56.458
<i>just waiting to be discovered.</i>

00:57.041 --> 00:59.458
<i>I could hear the ocean calling my name.</i>

01:00.583 --> 01:03.041
<i>By the time I was 12, I was obsessed.</i>

01:03.125 --> 01:06.041
<i>For four years,</i>
<i>I studied the ocean, the waves,</i>

01:06.125 --> 01:08.708
<i>and learnt everything I could</i>
<i>about sailing boats.</i>

01:08.791 --> 01:11.875
<i>I worked three part-time jobs</i>
<i>and saved money,</i>

01:11.958 --> 01:16.833
<i>because I dreamed that one day</i>
<i>I would sail around the world.</i>

04:05.875 --> 04:07.583
Jess, how's the practice run going?

04:07.666 --> 04:09.041
Cargo ship hit me.

04:09.791 --> 04:10.791
Came out of nowhere.

04:10.875 --> 04:11.916
You taking on water?

04:12.000 --> 04:15.625
No. No, doesn't look like it,
but I've been dismasted.

04:16.416 --> 04:18.083
<i>Why didn't the alarm go off?</i>

04:19.125 --> 04:20.791
Okay, give me your coordinates.

04:22.916 --> 04:26.500
Uh, we're at 26 degrees, 25…

04:31.000 --> 04:32.625
Jess, breathe.

04:34.083 --> 04:35.000
<i>Focus.</i>

04:57.375 --> 04:58.958
Oh, my God, what happened?

04:59.041 --> 05:00.041
She's okay.

05:01.250 --> 05:02.375
Collided with a cargo ship.

05:03.208 --> 05:04.833
She was hit by a cargo ship?

05:04.916 --> 05:06.125
Cool.

05:06.208 --> 05:07.208
Not cool, Tom.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.208
Is she gonna be all right?

05:09.291 --> 05:12.125
-I'm sure she'll be fine. Go back to bed.
-As if.

05:15.916 --> 05:17.625
Jess, are you hurt?

05:17.708 --> 05:19.333
<i>No, Mum, I'm fine.</i>

05:20.625 --> 05:22.083
Really, I promise.

05:26.500 --> 05:29.000
Thought we agreed, no collisions.

05:29.083 --> 05:30.291
I couldn't help myself.

05:30.375 --> 05:32.458
Can I talk to Jess?
I want to talk to Jess!

05:32.541 --> 05:34.541
-Oh, can I talk to her?
-I haven't talked to her.

05:34.625 --> 05:37.708
-Jess, was it a pirate ship?
-She's getting her coordinates wrong.

05:37.791 --> 05:38.833
Okay, come on. That's it.

05:38.916 --> 05:40.333
-I'm calling the Coast Guard.
-Don't.

05:40.416 --> 05:42.041
Reporters will be lining the docks.

05:42.125 --> 05:45.583
They are waiting for her to fail.
She cannot come limping back in.

05:45.666 --> 05:48.375
-Do we know if the boat's seaworthy?
-She reckons it is.

05:48.458 --> 05:52.791
-Oh, well, as long as the 16-year-old--
-Jess needs to know she can do this alone.

05:53.875 --> 05:55.583
She's only 20 miles from the shore.

05:56.541 --> 05:57.958
Now imagine if she does this,

05:58.041 --> 06:00.458
and she's 2,000 miles
from the nearest port.

06:01.166 --> 06:04.208
We'll be at the marina to meet you.
It's probably not that bad in daylight.

06:04.291 --> 06:05.458
Thanks, Em.

06:19.250 --> 06:20.208
Jess!

06:23.375 --> 06:25.166
Okay, so when I say tack,

06:25.250 --> 06:27.958
we're gonna switch the sail
to the other side.

06:28.041 --> 06:29.083
You ready to win?

06:29.583 --> 06:32.125
All right, guys, let's get started!

06:39.333 --> 06:40.541
Hey! Jess, what's wrong?

06:40.625 --> 06:42.291
-I'm not ready.
-No?

06:42.375 --> 06:44.666
-Oh, sweetheart.
-Don't want to go, kiddo?

06:45.250 --> 06:47.250
I think
we're still finding our sea legs.

06:47.333 --> 06:49.583
-Fair enough.
-Well, I heard you're the favorite to win.

06:50.583 --> 06:52.041
Yeah. Maybe.

06:53.291 --> 06:54.416
Come on, Jess!

06:54.500 --> 06:57.125
You won't know
what's out there unless you try.

06:57.208 --> 06:58.916
No, no, not too far.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.250
Wait, Emily, wait!

07:01.041 --> 07:02.041
Quick, Jess!

07:07.375 --> 07:08.916
Whoa!

07:09.000 --> 07:09.833
Come here.

07:09.916 --> 07:10.958
There you go.

07:19.333 --> 07:23.416
Jessica Watson's only sea trial
has been cut short, proving her critics…

07:25.916 --> 07:28.833
Atherton! Hey, Atherton!

07:29.416 --> 07:31.083
How come he's allowed down there?

07:35.208 --> 07:37.166
-Atherton.
-Ben.

07:37.250 --> 07:39.416
Don't know what you lot
think you're doing here.

07:40.541 --> 07:42.833
Well, I guess we're here because…

07:42.916 --> 07:47.666
that boat is a shockingly tiny thing
to send a child out to sea in.

07:47.750 --> 07:49.958
-It's pretty flimsy too.
-Leave it.

07:50.583 --> 07:51.583
Vultures.

07:52.208 --> 07:53.291
Then don't feed them.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.875
Why aren't we feeding vultures?

07:56.500 --> 07:58.791
It's not every day
that someone as young as your sister

07:58.875 --> 08:00.500
tries to do what she's doing.

08:00.583 --> 08:03.208
It's a big deal.
People have questions, that's all.

08:03.291 --> 08:04.791
-Mm.
-Plus, it makes her a target.

08:04.875 --> 08:07.916
If she succeeds, she's a hero.
If she fails, well, tragedy sells.

08:09.375 --> 08:10.500
She's ten.

08:16.416 --> 08:19.666
They're looking for weakness.
Don't let 'em treat you any different.

08:20.958 --> 08:22.500
You're a captain, got it?

08:32.666 --> 08:36.541
All right, I'm Ben Bryant,
Jessica's advisor.

08:37.166 --> 08:38.000
Jess.

08:38.958 --> 08:40.333
I-- I'm Jessica Watson.

08:42.875 --> 08:46.500
And, uh, I… I'm planning
on being the youngest person

08:46.583 --> 08:49.083
to sail around the world
nonstop and unassisted.

08:49.166 --> 08:50.625
Jessica, what happened last night?

08:50.708 --> 08:52.833
-There was a collision.
-Were you at fault?

08:52.916 --> 08:54.791
A cargo ship detoured from its route.

08:54.875 --> 08:58.833
Jessica, this was night one
of your only test run.

08:58.916 --> 09:02.458
How are you gonna make it around the world
if you can't make it between two ports?

09:02.541 --> 09:04.708
Uh, and we're not here for you.
Thanks, Ben.

09:06.500 --> 09:07.333
I believe I can.

09:07.416 --> 09:09.125
You understand
what you're in for?

09:10.500 --> 09:14.541
Uh, we're talking open ocean,
waves the size of apartment buildings,

09:14.625 --> 09:15.750
70-knot winds.

09:15.833 --> 09:18.583
I mean, this is
the Mount Everest of sailing.

09:18.666 --> 09:21.458
Well, yes, the-- the route is challenging,

09:21.541 --> 09:23.750
but, uh, I've sailed half my life, so I--

09:23.833 --> 09:25.041
So a couple years then?

09:26.125 --> 09:29.333
I've done the 10,000 nautical miles.
I'm qualified.

09:30.125 --> 09:31.125
And we've prepared.

09:31.208 --> 09:34.083
How could she prepare
for a cargo ship that ignores its radar?

09:34.166 --> 09:37.625
So why didn't your proximity alarms
alert you before the crash?

09:40.916 --> 09:43.375
-I forgot to turn them on.

09:44.833 --> 09:47.666
Mr. and Mrs. Watson,
surely you have reservations hearing that?

09:48.875 --> 09:52.208
She made a mistake.
It's one I'm certain she won't make again.

09:52.291 --> 09:54.166
So you don't think 16 is too young?

09:54.250 --> 09:56.458
Who are we to deny her her dreams?

09:56.958 --> 09:59.750
She's worked hard and proven
she can do this every step of the way.

09:59.833 --> 10:02.166
So when is the new departure day?

10:02.958 --> 10:05.666
Uh, well, I guess we just have
to leave by mid-October.

10:05.750 --> 10:08.916
So two weeks. Hmm, optimistic, no?

10:09.416 --> 10:12.958
Well, it's the last window before
the Southern Ocean's filled with icebergs.

10:13.041 --> 10:16.416
Jessica! Well, what about calls
by authorities to cancel altogether?

10:16.500 --> 10:19.041
Ben, are you the right person
to bring this girl home?

10:19.125 --> 10:20.541
Got a bit of experience.

10:20.625 --> 10:23.625
But as captain in the Millennium Cup,
you lost one of your own crew members.

10:23.708 --> 10:24.958
A Matt Turner.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.500
Hey! That's enough.

10:26.583 --> 10:28.708
-Well, let me finish--
-Nah. We're done here.

10:33.958 --> 10:36.666
Four years of hard work
boils down to this.

10:36.750 --> 10:39.250
Ben, I looked at the radar
and I didn't see the ship.

10:39.333 --> 10:41.791
And it was just a short nap.
So I didn't think that--

10:41.875 --> 10:44.833
No, you didn't think.
It was irresponsible, Jess.

10:44.916 --> 10:47.458
You know you kept getting
your coordinates wrong too?

10:49.375 --> 10:51.583
It's your state of mind
that matters out there.

10:51.666 --> 10:55.416
If dyslexia takes over, you are lost
in the middle of the ocean, mate.

10:55.500 --> 10:57.416
All right. All right, we get it.

10:59.708 --> 11:01.166
Do you reckon we can fix it?

11:03.166 --> 11:04.958
Bit of a dog's breakfast, but…

11:05.916 --> 11:08.375
-Yeah, there's some life left in her yet.

11:08.458 --> 11:10.750
I mean, these aren't
small repairs, though.

11:11.500 --> 11:14.708
We've got no money, no manpower,
no location to even fix it.

11:14.791 --> 11:16.458
Yeah, but won't my sponsors help?

11:17.291 --> 11:19.916
Not sure they'll want to pay
for a new mast twice over.

11:20.750 --> 11:22.458
We can get creative with a lot of it.

11:22.541 --> 11:25.166
You know, reuse this rig,
patch where possible.

11:25.250 --> 11:27.791
Not a chance.
We do it right, down to the smallest bolt.

11:27.875 --> 11:29.333
But what if we can't get the money?

11:29.416 --> 11:31.291
-Then you wait another year.
-Dad!

11:31.375 --> 11:33.333
Your safety is
the only thing that matters.

11:33.416 --> 11:36.291
And I have no problem calling this off
if things aren't done properly.

11:36.791 --> 11:41.291
You know… maybe we should regardless.
This has been quite the wake-up call.

11:41.375 --> 11:44.500
-No. It was an accident--
-Hey, no one's making any decisions now.

11:44.583 --> 11:47.666
Let's wait and see what the sponsors
have to say first. Right, Jess?

11:48.250 --> 11:49.541
Yeah. Yeah, right.

11:51.500 --> 11:52.333
Oh!

11:54.000 --> 11:54.916
Ugh.

11:57.125 --> 12:01.041
<i>Last year's NRL</i>
<i>Grand Final winners, the Manly Sea Eagles,</i>

12:01.125 --> 12:03.875
<i>look set to take out</i>
<i>the premiership again this year</i>

12:03.958 --> 12:08.541
<i>after thrashing the Melbourne Storm</i>
<i>34-6 over the weekend.</i>

12:08.625 --> 12:11.750
<i>This will be Manly's</i>
<i>third consecutive Grand Final.</i>

12:11.833 --> 12:13.458
Don't forget netball after school.

12:13.541 --> 12:15.875
-Eyes on me. And…
-Yep. And, go!

12:15.958 --> 12:17.458
Oi, very good!

12:17.541 --> 12:19.916
Don't think anything new's
gonna appear in there, Tom.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.625
-Very good.

12:22.375 --> 12:24.833
-You're gonna make yourself dizzy.
-I know!

12:25.416 --> 12:27.708
-Got you!
-Oi! Cut it out!

12:27.791 --> 12:30.291
-Would they pay me for interviews?
-Not enough for repairs.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.500
-<i>Jessica Watson's adventure…</i>
-Jess, look!

12:32.583 --> 12:36.833
<i>…began when her family packed up</i>
<i>their lives and traveled across Australia.</i>

12:36.916 --> 12:40.250
<i>When she read</i>
<i>solo sailor Jesse Martin's book,</i>

12:40.333 --> 12:43.625
<i>she was inspired</i>
<i>to circumnavigate the globe.</i>

12:44.333 --> 12:47.791
<i>While homeschooled,</i>
<i>12-year-old Jessica began training</i>

12:47.875 --> 12:52.875
<i>with infamous sailor Ben Bryant,</i>
<i>and worked rigorously to pursue her dream.</i>

12:52.958 --> 12:56.333
<i>But has that dream</i>
<i>turned into a nightmare?</i>

12:56.416 --> 12:57.583
Whoa! Plot twist!

12:57.666 --> 12:59.041
<i>Child welfare groups are calling</i>

12:59.125 --> 13:01.458
<i>the attempt by the schoolgirl</i>
<i>irresponsible and dangerous.</i>

13:01.541 --> 13:02.833
They can't help themselves.

13:02.916 --> 13:07.333
<i>A child does not have the ability</i>
<i>to understand the risks involved.</i>

13:07.416 --> 13:09.875
You'd think they'd have something
bloody better to talk about.

13:09.958 --> 13:14.291
<i>The question on everyone's lips,</i>
<i>"Is Jessica Watson too young,</i>

13:14.375 --> 13:16.750
<i>and where are her parents in all of this?"</i>

13:17.250 --> 13:20.500
<i>You do have to wonder</i>
<i>if this is Jessica's dream or theirs.</i>

13:20.583 --> 13:24.083
It's on social media too.
They're calling us "bogan pirates."

13:25.416 --> 13:27.666
Oh, come on, that's great.

13:27.750 --> 13:29.166
Let me write a comment!

13:29.250 --> 13:30.833
-No, Hannah.
-No, Hanna, no.

13:30.916 --> 13:33.666
<i>The Queensland government</i>
<i>is working on a bill</i>

13:33.750 --> 13:37.416
<i>to stop Jessica from sailing,</i>
<i>citing child welfare.</i>

13:37.500 --> 13:39.708
They can't do that! Can they?

13:47.708 --> 13:50.125
<i>The person</i>
<i>you are calling is unavailable.</i>

13:50.208 --> 13:51.375
<i>Please try again.</i>

13:57.000 --> 13:58.333
It can't be that bad.

13:58.416 --> 14:00.666
Oh, no.
No, just everything's falling apart.

14:01.958 --> 14:03.166
Sheds are booked up.

14:03.250 --> 14:07.250
Can't afford help or parts, and now,
none of my sponsors are responding.

14:07.833 --> 14:09.500
You have to give them a minute.

14:09.583 --> 14:11.166
I don't have time.

14:12.666 --> 14:15.083
I bet they're watching the news.

14:17.291 --> 14:20.000
-Everyone's saying I can't do it.
-Who cares?

14:20.833 --> 14:23.583
-You think you can.
-Only if I get Pink fixed in time.

14:30.166 --> 14:32.375
I know things
aren't going according to plan,

14:32.458 --> 14:35.000
and… I know how frustrating that is.

14:35.958 --> 14:39.875
But it's when things go wrong
that your true character's revealed.

14:41.125 --> 14:44.833
And right now, I'm looking at a strong,
committed, tenacious young woman

14:45.833 --> 14:47.375
who will figure this out.

14:50.208 --> 14:52.125
So I'm not those things
the rest of the time?

14:52.208 --> 14:54.250
No, the rest of the time
you're an absolute nightmare.

14:54.333 --> 14:56.000
Yeah.

14:58.166 --> 15:01.541
You can overcome anything
if you keep working at it, Jess.

15:03.500 --> 15:05.000
I've watched you do it before.

15:14.875 --> 15:16.166
It's impossible.

15:16.750 --> 15:19.458
Let's try something
a little more up your alley.

15:20.041 --> 15:22.666
The colors will help you focus. Try again.

15:22.750 --> 15:23.958
Hmm.

15:24.541 --> 15:25.791
"Jesse Martin,

15:26.875 --> 15:29.250
the youngest person

15:29.333 --> 15:32.375
to s-- sail solo

15:32.958 --> 15:35.000
ar-- around the world."

15:35.750 --> 15:36.958
Around the whole world?

15:38.791 --> 15:39.750
You can do that?

15:48.791 --> 15:52.083
I did a full inspection
and I got costs.

15:52.166 --> 15:55.625
And we'll need a new mast,
new rigging, hull repairs.

15:57.250 --> 15:59.791
That is just a slight delay, I reckon.

15:59.875 --> 16:01.666
As long as I'm on the ocean
before November.

16:02.708 --> 16:04.958
-Hello, Earth to Ben!
-What?

16:05.541 --> 16:07.541
Come on, Ben, I'm serious.
We can still do this.

16:07.625 --> 16:09.958
-There's still time to fix up Pink--
-I know.

16:10.833 --> 16:12.375
-You coming?

16:14.291 --> 16:15.291
Where to?

16:17.791 --> 16:19.208
Got something to show you.

16:28.125 --> 16:30.541
-Ben, I don't want another boat.
-Yep.

16:30.625 --> 16:32.875
Pink and I are a team. I know Pink.

16:32.958 --> 16:34.083
I know when she's angry.

16:34.166 --> 16:36.291
-I know when she's in trouble.
-Yeah.

16:55.291 --> 16:56.875
Rounded up a bit of assistance.

16:57.791 --> 16:59.250
Once the media attacked you,

16:59.333 --> 17:01.500
I couldn't stop 'em
from volunteering to help.

17:02.083 --> 17:02.958
Why?

17:03.708 --> 17:05.916
Well, media went after one of our own.

17:06.500 --> 17:09.958
You might be sailing solo,
but you belong to a tribe now.

17:11.166 --> 17:13.791
This gets you on the water
before they pass this blasted bill.

17:18.083 --> 17:20.541
-It's all real, Jess. Look behind you.
-She's here!

17:21.041 --> 17:22.083
Hey.

17:25.958 --> 17:28.208
Oi, Hannah, don't touch anything! No!

17:30.583 --> 17:31.500
Come on!

17:40.875 --> 17:42.708
Cloth? Thanks, mate.

17:46.541 --> 17:48.041
Okay, just a sec.

17:55.125 --> 17:57.083
Right, it's one, two, three, four.

17:58.500 --> 17:59.583
Tom!

18:38.166 --> 18:39.083
Hey, Roger.

18:39.166 --> 18:40.916
-Rog, mate, just a quick question.

18:54.083 --> 18:55.041
Hey, Pink.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.166
Welcome back.

19:05.875 --> 19:08.666
-No!
-Easy, easy!

19:09.416 --> 19:11.500
Can't they take a break for one day?

19:11.583 --> 19:14.125
<i>And calls to stop</i>
<i>Jessica only grow.</i>

19:14.208 --> 19:16.875
<i>Even her father</i>
<i>expressed doubt earlier today.</i>

19:16.958 --> 19:19.833
<i>Rog! Man, how are you feeling</i>
<i>about Jess's collision?</i>

19:19.916 --> 19:22.625
<i>Well, uh, you know,</i>
<i>any teen crashing their vehicle</i>

19:22.708 --> 19:24.958
<i>doesn't exactly fill you</i>
<i>with confidence, does it?</i>

19:26.166 --> 19:27.958
What happened to not talking to the media?

19:28.041 --> 19:29.125
It was a joke.

19:29.208 --> 19:30.791
That you made on national TV.

19:30.875 --> 19:33.375
Uh, he took it out of context, you know?

19:34.708 --> 19:36.708
-Do you think I can't do it?
-What?

19:37.875 --> 19:40.083
Uh… I don't know.

19:40.833 --> 19:44.041
To be honest, I thought this would be
something you'd fixate on for a month

19:44.125 --> 19:45.458
and then you'd get over it.

19:45.541 --> 19:46.916
Rog, stop.

19:50.125 --> 19:50.958
I'm sorry.

19:54.333 --> 19:55.833
Do you wish I wasn't going?

19:57.666 --> 19:58.500
Hey.

19:59.916 --> 20:01.541
You listen to me, all right?

20:02.166 --> 20:05.458
I want you to achieve
everything that you aspire to.

20:06.750 --> 20:08.458
But…

20:09.166 --> 20:10.666
you're my little girl.

20:12.250 --> 20:13.083
Yeah?

20:16.041 --> 20:16.875
Yeah.

20:20.083 --> 20:21.083
Jess.

20:24.791 --> 20:27.000
Hey. Don't you start.

20:27.958 --> 20:29.958
Damn it.

20:36.875 --> 20:39.916
You know he doesn't mean it.
He's just scared.

20:41.625 --> 20:42.666
No.

20:43.666 --> 20:46.791
Maybe the journo's right,
maybe I should just… quit,

20:46.875 --> 20:48.500
and sneak out to parties.

20:48.583 --> 20:50.708
Dad definitely doesn't like that either.
Trust me.

20:54.583 --> 20:57.125
You know, people are
always gonna have opinions

20:57.208 --> 20:59.250
on what you should and shouldn't be doing.

21:00.250 --> 21:02.500
But I see how happy you are when you sail,

21:03.625 --> 21:05.250
so just do it for you.

21:06.041 --> 21:07.541
You're very wise.

21:08.250 --> 21:10.708
All right. Surprise time.

21:10.791 --> 21:12.416
-Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

21:14.708 --> 21:17.166
I set up a blog for your trip.

21:17.250 --> 21:19.625
-What?
-Don't worry. I'll run it.

21:21.333 --> 21:23.083
Then everyone can hear your voice,

21:23.958 --> 21:25.708
'cause I think it's worth listening to.

21:26.666 --> 21:27.500
Sometimes.

21:33.458 --> 21:34.375
Thanks, Em.

21:36.208 --> 21:37.083
Tim Tam?

21:40.125 --> 21:41.291
Okay, I'm warmed up.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.541
-You guys good? Three, two, one.
-Rolling.

21:47.208 --> 21:49.041
And the day has finally come.

21:49.125 --> 21:52.166
In just a few hours
and after several setbacks,

21:52.250 --> 21:56.166
Jessica Watson is set
to embark on her solo voyage,

21:56.666 --> 21:59.916
ignoring her critics
and outrunning the government bill.

22:01.458 --> 22:03.625
Whoo! That's the one. Print that.

22:05.083 --> 22:07.291
There you go.
Yeah, thanks, darling.

22:13.166 --> 22:14.500
For when you get lonely.

22:14.583 --> 22:18.125
No, I can't take Kobi Koala.
She's your favorite.

22:18.208 --> 22:19.041
Yeah.

22:19.708 --> 22:21.625
That's why she's just on loan.

22:21.708 --> 22:22.541
Okay?

22:23.958 --> 22:26.083
All right, then I promise
to bring her home safe, yeah?

22:34.500 --> 22:36.833
-All right, fast and quick.
-Yeah.

22:38.291 --> 22:39.125
Mmm.

22:40.208 --> 22:41.958
Doing an awful lot to get out of homework.

22:45.458 --> 22:47.625
Bye, Tom. All right.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.125
-So I packed the chocolate you asked for.

22:57.208 --> 23:00.041
-Don't eat it all in one go, all right?
-Thanks, Dad.

23:00.125 --> 23:02.541
I want you to call and give me
your longs and lats twice a day.

23:02.625 --> 23:03.708
Why?

23:03.791 --> 23:06.125
Because if you get them wrong,
I'll know you're stressed.

23:06.208 --> 23:07.875
Using dyslexia to spy on me?

23:07.958 --> 23:09.291
Yeah, that's right.

23:09.375 --> 23:11.041
-No buts, all right?

23:19.000 --> 23:20.083
You'll be all right.

23:24.250 --> 23:25.083
Hey.

23:28.375 --> 23:29.666
Watch the sunsets,

23:30.375 --> 23:34.333
celebrate the milestones,
and… don't forget to dance in the rain.

23:37.791 --> 23:39.333
You come back home safe, okay?

23:41.291 --> 23:42.333
Okay.

23:49.083 --> 23:50.416
Do you think she's ready?

23:51.333 --> 23:52.750
Only one way to find out.

23:55.083 --> 23:57.333
It's a good luck charm from my first nav.

23:59.875 --> 24:02.083
Always brought me back. It's yours now.

24:02.166 --> 24:04.000
-Ben, I can't.
-'Course you can.

24:05.458 --> 24:07.333
-Oh.

24:08.708 --> 24:10.000
Go on. Get out of here.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
Bye, Jess!

24:34.875 --> 24:35.875
Good luck!

24:36.625 --> 24:37.625
Bye!

24:41.458 --> 24:42.541
She'll be okay.

24:47.500 --> 24:48.333
Mmm.

25:34.166 --> 25:35.166
All right.

25:40.166 --> 25:41.625
There she is, starting now.

25:43.583 --> 25:46.541
-Four-point-one-three?
-Four-point-one-three.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.333
Oh, whoa! All right, Pink!

27:14.875 --> 27:17.375
-Ew, you're disgusting!
-My mouth is full.

27:19.416 --> 27:21.666
Okay, so listen up.

27:22.500 --> 27:25.500
Ben's agreed to work in here
while, uh, he's tracking Jess,

27:25.583 --> 27:27.250
so just give him
a bit of space, all right?

27:31.708 --> 27:34.333
In your dreams…

27:37.333 --> 27:38.500
What is all this stuff?

27:38.583 --> 27:40.125
Don't touch anything.

27:40.208 --> 27:42.708
-Then don't touch my Weet-Bix.
-Fine.

27:42.791 --> 27:44.125
-Fine.

27:45.208 --> 27:46.791
All right.

27:56.916 --> 27:58.250
-Is that Jessica?

27:58.333 --> 28:00.500
-I got it! I got it.
-Mine, mine, mine!

28:00.583 --> 28:01.416
Hey, mate.

28:01.500 --> 28:06.958
27 degrees, 33 minutes south,
and 170 degrees, 30 minutes east.

28:07.541 --> 28:08.875
-Spot on.

28:09.375 --> 28:11.375
How are the supplies,
do you have enough?

28:11.458 --> 28:13.166
<i>Dad, I only just left.</i>

28:13.250 --> 28:15.625
-Okay.
-Uh… Oh, no, Jules! Oh, my--

28:16.708 --> 28:17.625
Jess!

28:18.125 --> 28:19.333
<i>Hi, Mum!</i>

28:19.416 --> 28:21.958
How's it feel out there?

28:23.875 --> 28:25.250
Worth the wait.

28:41.208 --> 28:42.333
Chuck the rope.

28:42.875 --> 28:43.791
Ugh.

28:44.666 --> 28:45.541
I got it.

28:48.791 --> 28:49.791
Just do it!

29:09.041 --> 29:10.333
Is that acceptable?

29:10.833 --> 29:12.625
Yep. Thanks, kid.

29:13.916 --> 29:16.666
No one thinks I'm big
or strong enough to do anything.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.166
But I am!

29:19.250 --> 29:21.958
I practice all the time,
whenever I get the chance.

29:22.458 --> 29:24.625
You don't have to prove
anything to me, mate.

29:25.125 --> 29:27.125
Well, that's what girls have to do.

29:28.791 --> 29:30.708
Are you Ben Bryant?

29:31.500 --> 29:33.458
-No.
-Yes, you are.

29:33.541 --> 29:37.458
You lost the tip of your pinky finger
sailing in Antarctica.

29:40.458 --> 29:41.500
I didn't lose it.

29:43.250 --> 29:45.375
-I put it in the drawer.
-Cool.

29:46.583 --> 29:51.250
You've done 12 Sydney to Hobarts
and circumnavigated solo three times.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.500
Is solo sailing good?

29:53.583 --> 29:55.291
Yeah, it's great.

29:55.375 --> 29:56.833
No one talks to you.

29:58.583 --> 30:01.000
I'm trying to get experience
so I can sail the world,

30:01.083 --> 30:02.875
but no one's giving me a chance to.

30:03.833 --> 30:04.750
So?

30:05.708 --> 30:07.125
Make your own chance.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.541
Hi, I'm Jess.

30:13.625 --> 30:15.041
Welcome to my video log!

30:15.125 --> 30:16.875
Traditionally, sailors keep log books,

30:16.958 --> 30:20.375
but you can't deprive me
of screen time for half a year.

30:20.458 --> 30:24.041
I'm sure it'll just be my mum
watching, though. Hi, Mum!

30:25.375 --> 30:29.375
I thought I'd give you a tour
of my home for the next seven months, so…

30:30.541 --> 30:32.750
Here's my kitchen where I'll be cooking.

30:33.250 --> 30:37.750
And here is the nav table where I control
all the electrics and communication.

30:37.833 --> 30:40.416
Uh, my berth, where I'll sleep.

30:40.500 --> 30:41.375
Oh.

30:41.458 --> 30:43.125
Dunny.

30:44.250 --> 30:46.166
Uh, and this is where all my food is.

30:46.958 --> 30:48.250
For example…

30:49.125 --> 30:52.166
Oh, my God, freeze-dried broccoli.

30:57.041 --> 30:58.166
Nice one, Dad.

30:59.250 --> 31:01.625
So I'll be sailing unassisted and nonstop.

31:01.708 --> 31:03.875
So if I pull into port, I'm disqualified.

31:03.958 --> 31:07.541
And I have to cross all lines of longitude
and round all four capes

31:07.625 --> 31:10.125
for it to count
as a true circumnavigation.

31:10.791 --> 31:14.041
Here's what I'll be doing.
Okay, here's Sydney.

31:14.125 --> 31:16.291
Going northeast, up past the equator,

31:16.375 --> 31:19.791
then back down south
to round Cape Horn at the tip of Chile,

31:19.875 --> 31:25.166
then across the Atlantic Ocean
to the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa,

31:25.250 --> 31:30.666
then over the Indian Ocean
to Cape Leeuwin in Western Australia,

31:31.166 --> 31:35.125
then down around
the South East Cape in Tasmania,

31:35.208 --> 31:36.708
and back up to Sydney Harbor.

31:37.958 --> 31:39.750
So not so much really.

31:43.041 --> 31:44.041
Come on!

31:44.125 --> 31:47.833
All right, so this is the tiller to steer,

31:47.916 --> 31:50.041
but it's on autopilot at the moment.

31:50.125 --> 31:54.458
Uh, the lifeboat is under here,
and in here is the drogue.

31:54.958 --> 31:56.958
It's like a soft anchor.

31:57.041 --> 32:00.500
It slows the boat down during storms
and keeps it stable.

32:02.250 --> 32:03.458
Here's my shower,

32:04.083 --> 32:07.958
although I have discovered
that I left my hairbrush at home.

32:08.041 --> 32:11.125
So I'll just have to use this
for 200 days.

32:12.166 --> 32:14.416
At least the backyard
makes up for it, though.

32:33.291 --> 32:34.500
Hungry, Kobi?

32:43.833 --> 32:44.708
Oh.

32:45.458 --> 32:46.916
-Jess.
-Hey.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.791
Uh, ship detection alarms work.

32:49.375 --> 32:52.000
Uh,
one just went past northwest of me.

32:52.083 --> 32:53.041
Good to know.

32:53.958 --> 32:56.375
Well, that'll be the last ship
you see for a while now.

32:57.375 --> 32:58.333
How do you know?

33:01.375 --> 33:02.208
Listen,

33:03.291 --> 33:05.208
let that crash be a lesson to you, eh?

33:06.625 --> 33:08.125
<i>You know how to handle it now.</i>

33:12.250 --> 33:14.916
-Did you ever get lonely?
-Oh, sometimes.

33:15.875 --> 33:18.791
-But I know how to get over it.
-How?

33:20.000 --> 33:21.666
-Sing.
-Sing?

33:22.166 --> 33:23.083
You-- You sang?

33:23.166 --> 33:25.458
We're sailors.
That's what we're supposed to do.

33:27.833 --> 33:29.416
<i>Try to get some sleep, eh?</i>

33:30.333 --> 33:33.541
You've just got the first-week jitters,
that's all. Oh! Fish are calling.

33:33.625 --> 33:34.583
-Gotta go.
<i>-Okay.</i>

33:36.708 --> 33:37.625
Come on.

33:40.166 --> 33:41.625
Oh, bugger!

34:18.125 --> 34:21.500
<i>…the local girl</i>
<i>who is now attracting national attention.</i>

34:21.583 --> 34:26.708
<i>Jessica Watson's family traveled Australia</i>
<i>in a purpose-built double-decker bus</i>

34:26.791 --> 34:30.250
<i>before moving onto a boat</i>
<i>when Jessica was nine.</i>

34:30.333 --> 34:33.875
<i>Now, seven years later,</i>
<i>Jessica is about to cross</i>

34:33.958 --> 34:37.083
<i>the first major milestone in her attempt</i>
<i>to be the youngest person…</i>

34:37.166 --> 34:38.000
There we go.

34:38.083 --> 34:40.250
<i>…to sail solo around the world.</i>

34:40.333 --> 34:42.500
<i>Thanks, Susie.</i>
<i>The real danger, of course,</i>

34:42.583 --> 34:45.666
<i>will be the Indian and Southern Oceans,</i>
<i>where dozens of sailors,</i>

34:45.750 --> 34:48.458
<i>who are far more experienced</i>
<i>than young Jessica Watson,</i>

34:48.541 --> 34:50.625
<i>have endured knockdown after knockdown.</i>

34:50.708 --> 34:51.958
Didn't need to hear that.

34:52.041 --> 34:54.166
-<i>Solo sailors looking…</i>
-Ah, well.

34:54.250 --> 34:56.208
<i>…to circumnavigate the globe</i>
<i>endure many months…</i>

34:57.791 --> 35:01.916
Okay, so crossing the equator
is a big deal for sailors.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.291
You've proven your seaworthiness
and must be initiated

35:04.375 --> 35:06.041
into the Fraternity of Mariners.

35:07.125 --> 35:08.250
Okay, so…

35:08.333 --> 35:14.375
South, twenty, fifteen,
ten, five, zero!

35:14.458 --> 35:17.708
We crossed from the Southern Hemisphere
into the Northern Hemisphere!

35:18.291 --> 35:20.750
Okay,
for the initiation ceremony…

35:31.708 --> 35:33.416
Quite refreshing, actually.

35:33.500 --> 35:35.666
A toast to King Neptune!

35:42.250 --> 35:45.041
-To Jess.
-To Jess! Cheers!

35:48.291 --> 35:50.541
I can't believe
she's crossed the equator.

35:51.041 --> 35:51.958
So cool.

36:02.208 --> 36:04.333
Red sky at night,
sailor's delight.

36:04.416 --> 36:07.250
Red sky in the morning, sailor's warning.

36:16.583 --> 36:17.833
See the forecast?

36:17.916 --> 36:19.208
Yeah, sky says it all.

36:20.791 --> 36:24.916
Yeah. Jess, this is gonna be a big one.
Let's talk game, eh?

36:26.666 --> 36:28.083
I'll change course.

36:28.166 --> 36:31.000
I think you should launch the drogue.

36:31.708 --> 36:32.541
Weather it.

36:34.583 --> 36:35.875
<i>Go through the storm?</i>

36:35.958 --> 36:39.291
Well, it's moving fast.
There's no way you're gonna outrun it.

36:39.958 --> 36:41.916
But that also means
it's gonna pass quickly.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.708
-Thank God.
-W-- Hang on, hang on.

36:43.791 --> 36:45.666
We agreed to do whatever's safest.

36:45.750 --> 36:48.750
Storms in this region aren't common, Dad.
It's hard to judge.

36:50.375 --> 36:51.625
It's like an anchor.

36:51.708 --> 36:54.833
The drogue will keep her stable.
She'll be okay.

36:56.500 --> 36:58.333
I think it's our best option, Jess.

36:59.000 --> 36:59.833
It's your call.

37:04.833 --> 37:05.666
Okay.

37:08.416 --> 37:09.875
-Talk to me.

37:10.375 --> 37:12.166
Protocols. Yeah, let's break it down.

37:13.166 --> 37:15.541
I don't know. I don't-- I don't like this.

37:16.083 --> 37:18.208
Ben knows his stuff,
whatever you think of him.

37:18.291 --> 37:19.666
What's more, so does Jess.

37:22.916 --> 37:25.041
-<i>You know the drill.</i>
-Yeah.

39:59.833 --> 40:00.916
Come on, drogue!

40:39.916 --> 40:40.750
Whoa!

41:13.166 --> 41:17.958
I have something to tell you.
I want to circumnavigate the world solo.

41:18.041 --> 41:21.125
And I'm gonna be
the youngest person to do it.

41:21.208 --> 41:22.916
Uh, Jess…

41:23.000 --> 41:24.125
What?

41:25.458 --> 41:29.416
Jesse Martin did it when he was 17.
He was an ordinary kid, so am I.

41:29.500 --> 41:31.166
Mmm. Mmm?

41:32.125 --> 41:33.666
Don't worry, I've got a plan.

41:33.750 --> 41:36.458
I'll get a teacher, qualifications.

41:36.541 --> 41:41.375
Here's a list of all the things I'll need
and the safety courses I'll do to start.

41:43.541 --> 41:47.833
I'll get jobs to earn money,
and find sponsors to cover the big costs,

41:47.916 --> 41:52.208
and for every hour I sail,
I'll still do an hour of reading.

41:52.291 --> 41:54.708
-Now, that's a good amount of reading!

41:54.791 --> 41:56.583
-She knows her audience.
-Yeah.

41:56.666 --> 42:00.250
Well, uh, you'd better start working
through that list, then. Thoroughly.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.666
I think you can do
anything you set your mind to, honey.

42:11.708 --> 42:13.166
Oh.

42:23.125 --> 42:25.625
-Jess! You okay?

42:26.833 --> 42:29.541
<i>-Yeah, I'm fine.</i>
-What happened? Why didn't you call?

42:31.000 --> 42:32.500
Well, I got knocked out,

42:32.583 --> 42:33.708
but I'm fine.

42:33.791 --> 42:36.583
-What?
-Knocked out? Are you okay?

42:36.666 --> 42:38.375
-Do you have a concussion?
-Sick.

42:38.458 --> 42:41.625
-You need a doctor!
-Oh, I didn't pack one of those.

42:42.208 --> 42:44.708
Hey, come on. Jess, listen to me.
Do you have a headache,

42:44.791 --> 42:46.666
ringing in the ears,
or nausea or something?

42:46.750 --> 42:48.708
Dad, please stop. I'm fine.

42:50.541 --> 42:51.500
Is Ben there?

42:55.250 --> 42:56.250
How's Pink?

42:59.708 --> 43:00.750
Yeah, she's all right.

43:01.250 --> 43:02.791
You weren't strapped in, were you?

43:03.750 --> 43:06.750
-I was getting there.
-Well, you should've already been there.

43:07.458 --> 43:10.416
<i>Mother Nature doesn't wait for anyone.</i>
<i>You know that, Jess.</i>

43:10.500 --> 43:11.583
It was a storm.

43:11.666 --> 43:12.750
It doesn't matter.

43:12.833 --> 43:16.333
You have to manage it. You're just lucky
you got through this one.

43:16.916 --> 43:19.833
It was so wild, Ben. I thought we
were gonna go all the way around.

43:19.916 --> 43:21.416
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:44.750 --> 43:46.250
Oh, it's Ben. Let's go.

43:46.333 --> 43:48.666
Ben! We just had word
Jess went through her first storm.

43:48.750 --> 43:49.958
Any injuries or damage?

43:50.625 --> 43:54.458
We aren't taking any questions,
but Jess has a blog at this address.

43:55.875 --> 43:57.708
Diversion 101.

43:59.083 --> 44:00.666
It's not that hard, Ben.

44:00.750 --> 44:02.458
Is there anything
you can add?

44:02.541 --> 44:04.625
Ben, excuse me.
Excuse me! Just one sec.

44:04.708 --> 44:05.541
She's going through--

44:05.625 --> 44:08.166
-Wait! Wait, Ben, sorry.
-Jimmy, hold this.

44:14.583 --> 44:16.791
<i>An albatross,</i>
<i>one of the only living things you see</i>

44:16.875 --> 44:17.916
<i>in the middle of the ocean.</i>

44:18.000 --> 44:20.458
<i>They've been watched</i>
<i>by sailors throughout history.</i>

44:20.541 --> 44:21.791
I think I caught a fish!

44:25.541 --> 44:26.375
Okay.

44:36.625 --> 44:37.958
Ooh! Okay.

44:41.250 --> 44:42.916
Come over here!

44:44.166 --> 44:45.125
Can you see it?

44:46.333 --> 44:48.375
Oh! Hello.

44:49.791 --> 44:51.500
-My turn!

44:51.583 --> 44:53.583
All right! Tom, grub's up!

44:54.875 --> 44:56.166
-Yup.
-Here you go.

44:57.291 --> 44:59.083
-Eat up!
-Thank you.

45:01.041 --> 45:01.875
Morning!

45:01.958 --> 45:03.083
-Ah.

45:04.541 --> 45:06.333
Ben? Here you go.

45:06.833 --> 45:08.166
I don't eat breakfast.

45:08.791 --> 45:12.083
Uh, well, don't then,
but it's here if you want it.

45:12.166 --> 45:13.416
Want to write something?

45:41.791 --> 45:43.833
Jess, I got into Sydney Uni!

45:44.416 --> 45:46.916
Oh, my gosh! Em, that's fantastic!

45:47.000 --> 45:48.958
Congratulations, you did it!

45:49.041 --> 45:51.208
I should warn you,
Hannah's already gunning for my bed.

45:51.291 --> 45:52.375
Right.

45:53.375 --> 45:55.166
Oh, you'll be gone before I get back.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.916
Yeah, I'll still run the blog, though.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.875
Jess, I won four medals
at the swimming carnival!

46:00.958 --> 46:05.500
Wow, Han! That's amazing!
I wish I could have been there.

46:05.583 --> 46:06.500
And guess what?

46:06.583 --> 46:07.666
Tom has a date.

46:08.500 --> 46:11.083
-Why would you--
-<i>What? With who?</i>

46:11.166 --> 46:12.666
-Give me the… Okay.

46:12.750 --> 46:14.750
-Jess!
-I want the phone!

46:14.833 --> 46:15.791
<i>I don't, I don't!</i>

46:15.875 --> 46:17.791
<i>-I don't know what--</i>
-<i>Yes, he does!</i>

46:17.875 --> 46:20.250
-I'm telling her!
-He does! He does!

46:20.333 --> 46:22.875
I'm talking to her
and I'm telling her who it is!

46:22.958 --> 46:24.333
I don't have-- I don't have a date.

46:24.416 --> 46:26.083
-<i>He does!</i>
<i>-I don't have a date.</i>

46:36.750 --> 46:37.625
Snap.

46:43.708 --> 46:46.416
-Go on, what do you got?
-Boogie board!

46:46.500 --> 46:48.916
-What? A boogie board?

46:49.000 --> 46:51.333
You'll be shocked to hear
that Hannah's riled up on sugar.

46:54.500 --> 46:56.000
Well, she's not the only one.

46:56.083 --> 46:58.291
And it's not
even Christmas here yet.

46:58.875 --> 47:01.000
<i>-Oh, is Em around?</i>
-Yeah, hold on!

47:02.291 --> 47:03.125
Em.

47:05.208 --> 47:07.000
Hey, Jess. Merry Christmas!

47:07.083 --> 47:08.750
Merry Christmas!

47:10.083 --> 47:12.041
A Grow Your Own Friend!

47:12.125 --> 47:14.208
<i>Aw, thank you, Em, it's just what I need.</i>

47:14.291 --> 47:17.125
-Yeah, I hear she's a great listener.

47:18.125 --> 47:19.708
-Hey, my turn!
-Oh, here's Dad.

47:20.791 --> 47:23.750
Merry Christmas, love.
Hey, I hear you've got a new mate.

47:24.250 --> 47:26.250
What have you two
got planned for tomorrow then?

47:26.333 --> 47:27.750
Oh, well, I'm hosting, uh,

47:27.833 --> 47:29.833
but my guests are
a little quieter than yours.

47:29.916 --> 47:32.083
-That's pretty cool, Hannah.

47:32.166 --> 47:34.458
That sounds great!
Mind if I come to yours?

47:35.875 --> 47:38.708
Jess! I forgot. Find the leeks bag.

47:38.791 --> 47:40.666
<i>Do you hear that? Leeks bag.</i>

47:50.916 --> 47:51.791
Ben!

47:51.875 --> 47:53.000
Mmm.

47:53.083 --> 47:54.583
Merry Christmas!

47:55.125 --> 47:56.291
Yeah.

47:56.833 --> 47:57.916
Come on in.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.583
Merry Christmas, Ben!

48:00.500 --> 48:03.000
-Merry Christmas, Ben!
-Yeah.

48:04.208 --> 48:05.708
Merry Christmas, mate.

48:06.916 --> 48:08.416
-There you are.
-Oh, thanks.

48:12.458 --> 48:14.875
Oh, I love them. Thank you, Tom.

48:19.500 --> 48:22.833
All right, it's a bit loud.
I'm gonna go now.

48:23.833 --> 48:25.333
Everybody say goodbye to Jess!

48:25.416 --> 48:27.708
-We love you!
-Yeah, see you, Jess!

48:27.791 --> 48:29.083
Tom, music!

48:29.666 --> 48:30.541
Yup.

48:32.625 --> 48:34.583
-Take this.
-Yeah. Cheers.

48:35.666 --> 48:37.583
Yeah, you're like…

48:40.000 --> 48:42.375
All right, food's on the table!
Come on, you lot.

48:54.125 --> 48:55.250
Hope you're hungry!

48:55.333 --> 48:57.000
Right, cracker time, Han, come on.

48:57.083 --> 48:58.041
Big pull!

49:00.250 --> 49:01.333
-Sorry, Ben.
-Ben.

49:04.958 --> 49:05.791
Hmm.

49:07.083 --> 49:09.625
Ben, what do you usually do for Christmas?

49:11.000 --> 49:11.833
Nothing.

49:13.291 --> 49:14.458
What about your family?

49:14.958 --> 49:17.583
Oh. Uh, don't have one.

49:21.208 --> 49:22.041
Oh.

49:38.958 --> 49:40.875
-Merry Christmas.
-For me?

49:41.666 --> 49:42.666
Open it, open it!

49:51.875 --> 49:52.875
Thank you.

49:54.791 --> 49:57.708
Ben, why is Cape Horn
such a big deal?

49:57.791 --> 49:58.916
Oh! Well…

49:59.875 --> 50:01.666
That is some wicked sailing.

50:02.416 --> 50:06.166
See, that's where the Atlantic
and Pacific Oceans meet,

50:06.250 --> 50:09.875
so you get these powerful winds,

50:09.958 --> 50:11.458
these churning currents,

50:11.541 --> 50:13.916
these humongous waves

50:14.000 --> 50:16.083
-as the oceans smash together.

50:17.541 --> 50:18.750
That's why that passage

50:19.750 --> 50:21.000
is so sinister.

50:22.083 --> 50:27.375
It's absolutely littered
with a long-lost trail of fingertips.

50:30.500 --> 50:32.083
-Uh, Ben?
-Hmm?

50:32.166 --> 50:34.041
Uh, could you maybe be
a little less excited

50:34.125 --> 50:35.916
about our daughter
doing something sinister?

50:36.000 --> 50:36.958
All right.

50:38.250 --> 50:40.208
We talking fast sailing?

50:42.375 --> 50:43.875
-Wicked fast.

50:43.958 --> 50:46.083
-Oh, my.

51:05.041 --> 51:06.458
Oh! Whoa.

51:06.541 --> 51:09.083
Look how fast she's going. Bloody hell.

51:10.583 --> 51:13.416
Oh, not-- not too fast. It's…

51:13.500 --> 51:16.000
-She's going quick.

51:17.000 --> 51:18.416
-Whoa.
-Come on!

51:18.500 --> 51:21.500
We just rounded the Everest
of the ocean, Cape Horn,

51:21.583 --> 51:24.250
and I am happy to report
it was smooth sailing.

51:24.958 --> 51:26.166
<i>And so cool!</i>

51:26.250 --> 51:28.333
<i>I, uh-- I just-- I just can't believe it.</i>

51:28.416 --> 51:30.541
<i>It's like we've passed</i>
<i>our biggest challenge.</i>

51:46.916 --> 51:47.958
Do you hear that?

51:49.500 --> 51:50.875
It's the sound of nothing.

51:52.625 --> 51:53.875
Nothing at all.

51:56.375 --> 51:59.041
There's no wind or waves.

51:59.750 --> 52:01.125
It's been days.

52:10.291 --> 52:11.416
You know where I am.

52:23.541 --> 52:26.583
I'm gonna sail around the world
and I'm hiring you as my coach.

52:27.708 --> 52:30.750
Tell your parents there's plenty
of coaches at the sailing school.

52:30.833 --> 52:32.375
I know, but I want you to do it.

52:33.208 --> 52:34.250
Well…

52:36.041 --> 52:37.541
I don't sail anymore.

52:37.625 --> 52:39.958
Because of the Millennium Cup, I know.

52:42.500 --> 52:45.291
But if you help
the youngest person in history

52:45.791 --> 52:47.708
sail solo around the world,

52:47.791 --> 52:50.625
people will let go
of what happened with Matt Turner.

52:50.708 --> 52:52.416
They might, but I won't.

52:56.291 --> 52:58.333
Hey, why-- why do you want
to do this, anyway?

52:59.541 --> 53:02.916
'Cause… no one explores anymore.

53:03.958 --> 53:06.333
You know, there have been
more people in space

53:06.416 --> 53:08.125
than have sailed around the world.

53:08.750 --> 53:12.500
I didn't even know it was something
you can do, but you can, and I want to.

53:13.791 --> 53:16.291
'Cause I'm an adventurer.

53:18.208 --> 53:19.416
You like sailing.

53:20.291 --> 53:23.416
Circumnavigating the globe
is a whole different thing, mate.

53:23.500 --> 53:26.208
Well, that's what I want
to find out for myself.

53:29.708 --> 53:31.833
You're gonna do this
no matter what I say, aren't you?

53:34.375 --> 53:38.208
If I was going to agree to this,
I'm not gonna treat you special,

53:39.166 --> 53:40.958
'cause it doesn't matter out there.

53:41.041 --> 53:43.291
I'll only treat you how I treat myself.

53:46.083 --> 53:47.750
Oi! First rule…

53:49.000 --> 53:49.833
don't do that.

53:51.166 --> 53:52.125
It freaks me out.

54:17.166 --> 54:19.208
-That's it. Come on.
-Okay.

54:20.708 --> 54:22.583
-Ben, you've barely slept in days, mate.
-Eh?

54:22.666 --> 54:24.708
-Take a break.
-Oh, nah. No, no.

54:24.791 --> 54:25.625
I'm good.

54:26.583 --> 54:28.916
Just, um, waiting on these logs.

54:30.083 --> 54:31.250
What is Jess doing?

55:17.083 --> 55:18.083
Jess?

55:18.958 --> 55:21.125
You've been going backwards
for hours, mate.

55:21.208 --> 55:22.625
Yeah, I was asleep.

55:23.750 --> 55:25.958
So you didn't set the alarms?

55:26.708 --> 55:29.458
Well, barely moved in a week,
how would I know we're going backwards?

55:29.541 --> 55:32.000
Again, that's why
you set the alarms, mate!

55:32.083 --> 55:33.625
Yeah, okay, chill out.

55:33.708 --> 55:37.041
"Chill out"? Hey, this is dangerous, okay?

55:37.666 --> 55:39.750
This is when things go wrong,
when people get hurt,

55:39.833 --> 55:42.000
when people
neglect their responsibilities!

55:42.083 --> 55:45.500
And you, if you keep on like this,
you're gonna get yourself killed!

55:46.500 --> 55:47.750
Yeah? Well, you'd know!

55:49.750 --> 55:50.958
Oi! What's going on?

55:52.375 --> 55:53.375
I, uh…

55:56.625 --> 55:57.666
You're right, Jess.

55:58.291 --> 55:59.166
Yeah.

56:00.083 --> 56:01.208
I need to chill out.

56:08.791 --> 56:09.625
Jess?

56:18.958 --> 56:22.083
There's no wind,
and there's no waves,

56:22.166 --> 56:24.333
and now there's no Ben.

56:25.791 --> 56:28.333
And it's just me.

56:30.416 --> 56:34.125
And I-- I can't get away from myself.

56:51.916 --> 56:53.250
I still haven't moved.

56:54.625 --> 56:56.250
Oh, thank God you picked up!

56:56.833 --> 56:58.125
What's going on, Jess?

56:59.666 --> 57:00.750
Mum.

57:03.125 --> 57:04.083
<i>What is it?</i>

57:09.041 --> 57:10.375
It's okay. I'm here.

57:12.583 --> 57:13.416
Get it out.

57:17.875 --> 57:19.166
I'm so alone.

57:22.375 --> 57:23.291
No, you're not.

57:26.166 --> 57:29.333
I know how awful it is to feel like this.

57:30.416 --> 57:31.250
<i>But…</i>

57:32.041 --> 57:33.500
<i>it won't last forever.</i>

57:35.875 --> 57:37.958
<i>I can't tell you</i>
<i>when the wind will pick up,</i>

57:38.041 --> 57:41.000
<i>but… I know that if you keep going,</i>

57:42.083 --> 57:43.250
it will.

57:46.083 --> 57:47.375
Just as it has done

57:47.875 --> 57:50.583
<i>for every sailor before you.</i>

57:57.166 --> 58:00.000
Do you remember the song
I used to sing to you at night?

58:00.583 --> 58:01.416
Yeah.

58:03.291 --> 58:06.708
I want you to search
for the brightest star in the sky.

58:08.916 --> 58:10.625
And every time you look at it,

58:11.416 --> 58:12.541
know that I'm here,

58:13.666 --> 58:14.500
at home…

58:17.166 --> 58:18.791
staring at that same star.

58:23.791 --> 58:24.791
<i>I'm with you.</i>

58:28.083 --> 58:28.916
<i>Okay?</i>

58:30.041 --> 58:31.375
Yeah, okay.

58:36.958 --> 58:38.708
I love you, Jess.

58:38.791 --> 58:40.250
I love you too.

59:45.666 --> 59:46.666
Hi.

59:48.708 --> 59:50.666
Sorry I haven't been here much.

59:52.541 --> 59:55.000
I've been avoiding a lot.

59:58.875 --> 1:00:03.041
Mmm, the truth is
that living your dream is hard.

1:00:04.583 --> 1:00:06.708
And right now it's really hard.

1:00:08.541 --> 1:00:10.458
I've been crying for hours.

1:00:11.416 --> 1:00:12.666
I'm tired.

1:00:14.041 --> 1:00:15.041
I'm sore.

1:00:16.083 --> 1:00:19.458
I can't properly stretch
my legs.

1:00:22.208 --> 1:00:23.958
I miss my family.

1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:29.333
I miss them a lot.

1:00:32.375 --> 1:00:34.625
<i>And I miss my grouchy advisor…</i>

1:00:37.166 --> 1:00:39.000
<i>…who's also my best friend.</i>

1:00:44.666 --> 1:00:46.291
Ah, but through it all,

1:00:46.375 --> 1:00:50.583
I've tried to be this--
this tough, stoic explorer.

1:00:50.666 --> 1:00:52.083
And…

1:00:52.166 --> 1:00:54.833
<i>…that's not me, you know?</i>

1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:01.750
<i>I'm not always fine,</i>
<i>or strong, or fearless.</i>

1:01:01.833 --> 1:01:04.208
<i>Phew! </i>"<i>Fearless."</i>

1:01:04.291 --> 1:01:05.958
<i>I'm often terrified!</i>

1:01:07.333 --> 1:01:09.000
And I doubt myself.

1:01:10.041 --> 1:01:11.041
And…

1:01:13.208 --> 1:01:15.000
I think a lot about giving up.

1:01:20.375 --> 1:01:21.541
But that's okay.

1:01:22.958 --> 1:01:24.000
It's okay.

1:01:27.083 --> 1:01:29.583
<i>'Cause there's--</i>
<i>there's strength in being yourself.</i>

1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:32.000
<i>You know, I think…</i>

1:01:32.875 --> 1:01:35.708
<i>that's as hard as climbing any mountain.</i>

1:01:39.458 --> 1:01:41.958
<i>You know, I think there's bravery</i>

1:01:43.666 --> 1:01:45.416
<i>in admitting that you're not okay.</i>

1:01:48.625 --> 1:01:50.166
<i>Oh, God, it's scary.</i>

1:01:50.916 --> 1:01:52.500
<i>It's as scary as…</i>

1:01:52.583 --> 1:01:55.583
<i>almost being swept overboard</i>
<i>in the middle of a storm.</i>

1:01:56.333 --> 1:01:58.166
<i>Not that I'd know, Mum and Dad.</i>

1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:01.833
<i>So…</i>

1:02:03.916 --> 1:02:05.375
<i>I'm Jessica Watson.</i>

1:02:06.416 --> 1:02:09.041
<i>Yeah, I'm tough and I'm struggling.</i>

1:02:10.666 --> 1:02:14.458
<i>And living my dream is-- is-- is hard,</i>

1:02:14.541 --> 1:02:15.916
<i>but it's so worth it.</i>

1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:18.333
<i>-Even the bad days.</i>

1:02:24.875 --> 1:02:26.416
<i>Because the world…</i>

1:02:26.500 --> 1:02:29.000
<i>Yeah, it can be</i>
<i>a difficult place, but it's…</i>

1:02:30.041 --> 1:02:33.500
<i>…it's also really, really beautiful.</i>

1:03:42.083 --> 1:03:44.125
Pink, you found the wind!

1:04:49.250 --> 1:04:50.083
G'day!

1:04:59.708 --> 1:05:02.166
Do you mind?
Recycling's over there. It's bin day.

1:05:54.458 --> 1:05:56.291
-Jessy!

1:05:56.875 --> 1:05:59.166
Hi, Dad. Um, any word from Ben?

1:06:00.041 --> 1:06:01.916
<i>He's tracking you from his boat.</i>

1:06:03.125 --> 1:06:04.125
<i>He's okay.</i>

1:06:04.875 --> 1:06:06.083
He just needs a minute, love.

1:06:07.541 --> 1:06:08.958
If this weren't nonstop,

1:06:09.041 --> 1:06:11.750
we would be pulling into port
for repairs, no question.

1:06:12.333 --> 1:06:15.125
I mean, leaking on a boat
is not what you want.

1:06:15.208 --> 1:06:18.791
But as long as we've got a clear shot
and an easy run back home,

1:06:20.041 --> 1:06:20.958
it should hold.

1:06:21.791 --> 1:06:24.750
Pink's designed to correct herself
if we roll over,

1:06:24.833 --> 1:06:26.416
as long as there are no leaks.

1:06:26.500 --> 1:06:28.500
That's what Ben would say too, I reckon.

1:06:29.291 --> 1:06:31.791
A lot of rips out there today.
Know what you're doing?

1:06:32.375 --> 1:06:34.541
-Go with 'em.
-Don't fight it.

1:06:36.166 --> 1:06:39.291
The ocean'll always be stronger
than you and every other being.

1:06:41.291 --> 1:06:44.291
If you wanna sail, better learn
to get along with Mother Nature.

1:06:45.625 --> 1:06:46.833
She doesn't mean you any harm,

1:06:46.916 --> 1:06:49.666
she's just doing her thing
and sometimes we get in the way.

1:06:50.875 --> 1:06:52.125
Come on then.

1:06:52.625 --> 1:06:53.750
Let's get in there.

1:07:27.458 --> 1:07:31.375
Jessica,
this is the Prime Minister of Australia.

1:07:31.958 --> 1:07:34.041
-You can call me K-Rudd if you--
-Gimme this.

1:07:34.125 --> 1:07:36.000
<i>Hey, Tom. What's up?</i>

1:07:36.083 --> 1:07:38.833
To be fair, the prime minister
has been talking about you.

1:07:39.416 --> 1:07:40.625
Em, you're home!

1:07:40.708 --> 1:07:41.750
Just for the week.

1:07:42.250 --> 1:07:44.375
It's crazy, everyone at uni
knows who you are.

1:07:44.458 --> 1:07:47.166
-Oh, God. I don't know if I want that.
<i>-Well, then brace yourself.</i>

1:07:47.250 --> 1:07:51.041
That picture of you rounding the cape
is in newspapers all over the world.

1:07:51.125 --> 1:07:52.541
Everyone's cheering for you.

1:07:53.458 --> 1:07:55.125
So please start doing your hair.

1:07:55.208 --> 1:07:57.000
Oh, come on. I have a fork for a brush.

1:08:00.333 --> 1:08:02.750
How's uni? Any new boys in Sydney?

1:08:02.833 --> 1:08:04.166
Maybe!

1:08:04.250 --> 1:08:05.625
Oh, my God, who?

1:08:06.708 --> 1:08:07.833
Well…

1:08:08.333 --> 1:08:10.625
Hey, uh, could you get Mum on the phone?

1:08:11.875 --> 1:08:12.708
<i>Now?</i>

1:08:25.708 --> 1:08:29.041
Bad weather on the way.
Really bad. Storms.

1:08:29.625 --> 1:08:31.125
"Storms," plural?

1:08:31.791 --> 1:08:33.916
<i>They're even coming</i>
<i>right at me from Antarctica.</i>

1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:35.708
<i>Five times the size of the last storm.</i>

1:08:35.791 --> 1:08:38.208
I think you might have to pull into port.

1:08:38.291 --> 1:08:39.416
Quit? No.

1:08:39.916 --> 1:08:41.458
No, I can't. Not now.

1:08:41.541 --> 1:08:43.375
I'm not sure you're gonna have
an option here.

1:08:43.458 --> 1:08:44.583
<i>Let me check the sky.</i>

1:08:54.041 --> 1:08:54.875
Hey.

1:08:56.041 --> 1:08:58.583
Why-- Why are you doing this to me?

1:08:58.666 --> 1:09:01.375
Why couldn't you
just give me a break?

1:09:13.833 --> 1:09:16.833
<i>The front's already generating</i>
<i>gale force winds</i>

1:09:16.916 --> 1:09:19.791
<i>of 70 knots, with a 40-foot swell.</i>

1:09:20.375 --> 1:09:24.375
<i>So will Jessica pull into port</i>
<i>but get disqualified in the process</i>,

1:09:24.458 --> 1:09:25.500
<i>or keep going?</i>

1:09:25.583 --> 1:09:29.500
<i>Thanks, Craig.</i>
<i>What about cutting through Bass Straight?</i>

1:09:29.583 --> 1:09:32.166
<i>It's an option, and could shield her</i>
<i>from the worst of the weather.</i>

1:09:32.250 --> 1:09:34.041
<i>Though she'd miss the fourth cape.</i>

1:09:34.125 --> 1:09:35.958
<i>But she'll live, Susie.</i>

1:09:36.750 --> 1:09:38.833
<i>That's what we're talking about</i>
<i>here, isn't it?</i>

1:09:39.333 --> 1:09:40.250
<i>Her survival.</i>

1:09:40.333 --> 1:09:44.166
Australian teen sailor Jessica Watson
has been confronted by another challenge

1:09:44.250 --> 1:09:47.333
in her attempt to become the youngest
person to circumnavigate the world.

1:09:59.458 --> 1:10:01.666
<i>You have nothing to be ashamed of.</i>

1:10:01.750 --> 1:10:04.541
Even the most experienced sailors
would pull in too.

1:10:04.625 --> 1:10:05.666
Yeah, even Ben would.

1:10:06.250 --> 1:10:07.208
Jules.

1:10:08.541 --> 1:10:10.416
Yeah, but I'm gonna let everyone down.

1:10:10.500 --> 1:10:11.916
You're not letting anyone down.

1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:14.541
<i>-Have you even seen your comments?</i>
What comments?

1:10:14.625 --> 1:10:15.583
On your blog.

1:10:17.125 --> 1:10:18.916
-Told you how to do this.

1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:20.125
No, you didn't.

1:10:20.208 --> 1:10:21.333
Yes, I did.

1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:23.416
<i>Okay, open your laptop.</i>

1:10:24.041 --> 1:10:25.708
<i>Click the link on to any post.</i>

1:10:25.791 --> 1:10:27.625
<i>Scroll down and watch.</i>

1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:32.208
<i>I can't wait to check</i>
<i>how you're doing every morning.</i>

1:10:32.291 --> 1:10:34.125
<i>You're stronger than anyone I know.</i>

1:10:41.125 --> 1:10:44.166
<i>There are 14 children</i>
<i>on the council estate</i>

1:10:44.250 --> 1:10:47.416
<i>who borrow my computer</i>
<i>to follow your video diary.</i>

1:10:47.958 --> 1:10:51.125
<i>Oh, you are such an inspiration</i>
<i>to these kids.</i>

1:10:51.208 --> 1:10:53.458
<i>I am going to climb the Seven Summits.</i>

1:10:53.541 --> 1:10:56.916
<i>Thank you for making me see</i>
<i>it doesn't have to just be a dream.</i>

1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:00.291
<i>I'm 12 years old and I'm also dyslexic.</i>

1:11:00.875 --> 1:11:03.458
<i>Following your videos has made me think</i>

1:11:03.541 --> 1:11:07.291
<i>that I can also reach my dream</i>
<i>and one day become a pilot.</i>

1:11:07.875 --> 1:11:11.208
<i>Thanks for making us</i>
<i>part of your journey, Captain Watson.</i>

1:11:12.291 --> 1:11:13.291
I'm gonna call you back.

1:11:16.208 --> 1:11:18.333
We are so close.

1:11:19.166 --> 1:11:20.125
So, so…

1:11:29.791 --> 1:11:31.166
<i>One, two, three.</i>

1:11:31.666 --> 1:11:34.833
<i>We love you, Jessica!</i>

1:11:34.916 --> 1:11:37.708
<i>See you in Sydney!</i>

1:11:43.375 --> 1:11:44.791
There has to be a way.

1:12:33.750 --> 1:12:35.416
I just want to get her home.

1:12:44.958 --> 1:12:48.083
<i>Okay, so I've done</i>
<i>the numbers over and over</i>,

1:12:48.166 --> 1:12:49.583
<i>and there is another option.</i>

1:12:50.416 --> 1:12:52.166
<i>I could outrun the western storm.</i>

1:12:52.250 --> 1:12:54.833
-No, not gonna happen.
-<i>Ben, you're back?</i>

1:12:54.916 --> 1:12:57.791
Yeah. About that, Jess,
I shouldn't have lost it.

1:12:57.875 --> 1:12:59.833
I let fear take over, and I'm sorry.

1:12:59.916 --> 1:13:01.875
No. No, no, no, I'm sorry.

1:13:01.958 --> 1:13:03.791
-Look, I--

1:13:03.875 --> 1:13:06.958
What I meant was that I'm not him
and this isn't the Millennium Cup,

1:13:07.041 --> 1:13:08.583
and you're not gonna lose me, Ben.

1:13:08.666 --> 1:13:09.875
<i>You're stuck with me.</i>

1:13:09.958 --> 1:13:11.666
Uh, storm incoming, remember?

1:13:11.750 --> 1:13:15.291
Yeah. So the worst of the storms
are gonna hit in 72 hours,

1:13:15.375 --> 1:13:17.083
so what if I go through them?

1:13:17.166 --> 1:13:19.541
What? These are not
the kind of storms you weather.

1:13:19.625 --> 1:13:22.083
No, I don't want to weather them,
I want to move with them

1:13:22.166 --> 1:13:23.458
by not using the drogue.

1:13:23.541 --> 1:13:25.041
Jess, you have to.

1:13:25.125 --> 1:13:27.208
The drogue's what keeps the boat stable.

1:13:27.291 --> 1:13:30.541
Yeah, but in the Pacific storms,
it slowed us down like an anchor.

1:13:30.625 --> 1:13:32.166
Yeah, that's the point!

1:13:32.250 --> 1:13:35.875
Yeah, but then we were battered
by these waves 'cause Pink fought them.

1:13:37.916 --> 1:13:40.833
I mean, you said
we shouldn't fight Mother Nature.

1:13:41.958 --> 1:13:43.125
So let's work with her.

1:13:44.625 --> 1:13:46.125
Let Pink surf.

1:13:46.208 --> 1:13:48.375
Wait, she's right.

1:13:49.166 --> 1:13:51.750
If you stand in front of the wave,
it knocks you down,

1:13:51.833 --> 1:13:53.791
but if you surf with them, it doesn't.

1:13:54.625 --> 1:13:55.625
Most of the time.

1:13:55.708 --> 1:13:57.916
Yeah, look, without the drogue,

1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:00.583
you're gonna be
up against 60-foot waves, Jess.

1:14:00.666 --> 1:14:03.833
Yeah, so instead of getting battered
by 'em, we'd ride over them.

1:14:04.333 --> 1:14:06.083
Pink being small would actually help.

1:14:06.791 --> 1:14:08.458
Is Pink up to this?

1:14:08.541 --> 1:14:11.458
You only just patched that crack
in the bulkhead. Will it hold?

1:14:12.041 --> 1:14:15.625
You're also exhausted, Jessy,
and the storm sounds like a marathon.

1:14:16.208 --> 1:14:17.625
I'm so close.

1:14:17.708 --> 1:14:19.333
Hey, don't worry about that.

1:14:19.416 --> 1:14:21.916
Making it home alive
is more important right now.

1:14:22.750 --> 1:14:24.208
You're gonna have to pull in.

1:14:28.708 --> 1:14:30.666
I agree with Ben. Be safe.

1:14:30.750 --> 1:14:32.583
No! Cut through the straight.

1:14:32.666 --> 1:14:34.000
Yeah, I like that option.

1:14:34.083 --> 1:14:35.583
I like the surfer one.

1:14:37.583 --> 1:14:39.541
I'm guessing you vote for "pull in," Dad?

1:14:39.625 --> 1:14:43.041
Well… yeah, it's obviously the safest…

1:14:45.375 --> 1:14:46.791
Oh, Jessy, uh…

1:14:47.833 --> 1:14:50.250
I-- I don't know. I really don't.

1:14:50.333 --> 1:14:52.666
I-- I barely sail offshore, but you,

1:14:52.750 --> 1:14:54.791
God, you've sailed around the world.

1:14:55.958 --> 1:14:57.916
Look, you know the ocean,

1:14:58.000 --> 1:14:59.208
you know your boat.

1:14:59.708 --> 1:15:02.041
I trust that you know what's best.

1:15:07.416 --> 1:15:08.666
Your Dad's right.

1:15:09.791 --> 1:15:11.458
You're the captain of that ship.

1:15:12.958 --> 1:15:16.000
We will support
whatever decision you make.

1:15:17.583 --> 1:15:19.750
<i>Thanks, Dad. Thanks, Mum.</i>

1:15:20.333 --> 1:15:21.250
<i>I love you.</i>

1:15:21.750 --> 1:15:23.291
We love you, Jessy.

1:15:23.375 --> 1:15:27.083
Ben, my gut is telling me
to go through these storms,

1:15:27.166 --> 1:15:28.500
and I'm not gonna use the drogue.

1:15:29.166 --> 1:15:30.291
It won't be easy.

1:15:31.416 --> 1:15:34.000
You'll need to be calm, endure fatigue.

1:15:35.166 --> 1:15:36.458
It's gonna last days.

1:15:37.125 --> 1:15:38.166
I know.

1:15:38.250 --> 1:15:39.291
I can do it.

1:15:40.083 --> 1:15:41.291
<i>I've got this, Ben.</i>

1:15:42.333 --> 1:15:44.541
As long as you understand
the consequences.

1:15:45.791 --> 1:15:46.791
I do.

1:15:48.958 --> 1:15:50.458
You're the captain, Captain.

1:15:55.750 --> 1:15:57.750
-Pizza for Watson!
-Pizzas!

1:15:57.833 --> 1:15:59.958
-Pizzas coming through.
-Grab 'em!

1:16:00.041 --> 1:16:00.958
Pizzas.

1:16:03.458 --> 1:16:05.208
-Oh.
-Pizza!

1:16:07.458 --> 1:16:09.958
Tom, can we get
some more information, please?

1:16:10.583 --> 1:16:12.458
Tom, just a quick second.

1:16:13.666 --> 1:16:16.291
Everyone right to go?
Okay, brief statement.

1:16:16.375 --> 1:16:18.125
Jess will be tackling the storm,

1:16:18.208 --> 1:16:21.166
continuing on in her attempt
to become the youngest to sail…

1:16:22.125 --> 1:16:26.041
nonstop and unassisted around the world.

1:16:26.125 --> 1:16:27.708
Surely, she should pull in.

1:16:28.291 --> 1:16:32.208
The captain has made her decision.
No further questions, thank you.

1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:34.125
Hannah!

1:16:34.208 --> 1:16:36.208
Emily, can we get
a quick statement, please? Emily?

1:17:05.541 --> 1:17:07.958
<i>Australians have seen</i>
<i>particularly terrifying storms</i>

1:17:08.041 --> 1:17:09.541
<i>ravaging the coastlines.</i>

1:17:09.625 --> 1:17:14.000
<i>The timing of the storm front is</i>
<i>especially devastating for Jessica Watson,</i>

1:17:14.083 --> 1:17:17.666
<i>whose nonstop, solo,</i>
<i>and unassisted circumnavigation</i>

1:17:17.750 --> 1:17:19.708
<i>is one cape shy of being completed.</i>

1:17:35.625 --> 1:17:36.875
Hold on, crew.

1:18:05.833 --> 1:18:07.125
We got this, Pink!

1:18:08.958 --> 1:18:09.875
Hey, Ben.

1:18:13.416 --> 1:18:15.208
Isobars are getting close together.

1:18:15.291 --> 1:18:16.333
What does that mean?

1:18:23.583 --> 1:18:25.958
The storm cells have merged.

1:18:26.041 --> 1:18:29.458
The three fronts
have morphed into one giant storm.

1:18:29.541 --> 1:18:33.083
<i>Now, one can only imagine</i>
<i>how Jessica must be feeling right now</i>

1:18:33.166 --> 1:18:35.500
<i>as she's about</i>
<i>to face her toughest challenge.</i>

1:19:34.500 --> 1:19:35.750
Jess, we're all here.

1:19:36.625 --> 1:19:37.625
<i>Hey. Hey!</i>

1:19:37.708 --> 1:19:40.291
Could you talk to me? I need distracting.

1:19:40.375 --> 1:19:41.791
I love earthworms!

1:19:41.875 --> 1:19:44.333
Nick! Nick, the boy's name's Nick.

1:19:44.416 --> 1:19:46.333
Um, what boy? What boy?

1:19:46.416 --> 1:19:48.375
And what if I don't make it?

1:19:48.458 --> 1:19:49.666
Not an option, mate.

1:19:50.583 --> 1:19:51.875
Hey, tell you what, Jess.

1:19:52.458 --> 1:19:53.583
You get back in one piece,

1:19:53.666 --> 1:19:57.125
<i>I'll take Bowie out of the docks</i>
<i>and sail to Sydney to meet you. Deal?</i>

1:19:57.833 --> 1:20:00.625
You'll sail? Like, open waters?

1:20:00.708 --> 1:20:02.875
Yeah, yeah, I might even sail
home to New Zealand.

1:20:02.958 --> 1:20:04.708
<i>But you gotta get here first.</i>

1:20:04.791 --> 1:20:06.041
Yeah, okay. Deal.

1:20:11.208 --> 1:20:13.666
Jessy? Jessy, you still there?

1:20:13.750 --> 1:20:17.208
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Might've had
a point not wanting me to do this, Dad.

1:20:18.083 --> 1:20:19.083
I'm scared!

1:20:20.416 --> 1:20:22.458
<i>Oh. Oh, Hannah, me too.</i>

1:20:22.541 --> 1:20:24.666
But I chose to be here, yeah?

1:20:24.750 --> 1:20:27.666
I chose to be here
and I'm never gonna regret it.

1:20:28.916 --> 1:20:30.625
Nothing ventured, nothing gained, right?

1:20:33.916 --> 1:20:35.458
-That's impossible.
-What?

1:20:35.541 --> 1:20:37.500
What's impossible? What's impossible?

1:20:37.583 --> 1:20:39.500
-What? Tell me, quick!
-Jess!

1:20:56.541 --> 1:20:58.625
That's it, Pink. You're doing great.

1:21:27.708 --> 1:21:28.708
Please, stop!

1:21:30.333 --> 1:21:32.083
Please, let her go!

1:23:02.041 --> 1:23:03.875
-Jess?

1:23:25.458 --> 1:23:26.458
Mum?

1:23:29.583 --> 1:23:31.166
Her emergency alarm went off.

1:23:34.208 --> 1:23:35.250
She's…

1:23:37.375 --> 1:23:38.875
15 feet underwater.

1:23:49.166 --> 1:23:50.083
No.

1:23:50.625 --> 1:23:51.875
No, she's all right.

1:23:53.416 --> 1:23:54.500
Call her.

1:24:01.625 --> 1:24:02.875
Hey, the phone…

1:24:03.916 --> 1:24:06.291
The phone loses signal
in storms, remember?

1:24:06.375 --> 1:24:07.750
-It's just the phone.

1:24:08.625 --> 1:24:09.666
It's just the phone.

1:24:21.708 --> 1:24:23.791
C-C-Come on, Jess, answer.

1:24:24.625 --> 1:24:25.666
Okay.

1:24:26.250 --> 1:24:27.333
-Jess!
-Stop.

1:24:27.416 --> 1:24:28.791
-Jess, no!
-Stop, Tom.

1:24:28.875 --> 1:24:30.083
No!

1:24:42.416 --> 1:24:44.791
-I got you.

1:24:49.333 --> 1:24:50.291
It's all right.

1:25:19.708 --> 1:25:21.041
-No.
-Jules.

1:25:21.833 --> 1:25:23.458
No…

1:25:24.208 --> 1:25:25.666
-Okay.
-No…

1:26:55.083 --> 1:26:56.666
Jess?

1:26:58.583 --> 1:26:59.583
We made it.

1:27:01.833 --> 1:27:02.833
Pink saved me.

1:27:07.166 --> 1:27:08.083
Jess?

1:27:08.666 --> 1:27:09.666
Hi, Mum.

1:27:11.166 --> 1:27:13.041
You don't know
how good it is to hear your voice.

1:27:13.125 --> 1:27:14.625
Oh, God.

1:27:16.166 --> 1:27:17.166
<i>Yours too.</i>

1:27:19.708 --> 1:27:21.958
Oh, God, you should see the sky right now.

1:27:22.041 --> 1:27:23.500
<i>Yeah? Pretty special?</i>

1:27:25.333 --> 1:27:26.333
Really special.

1:27:28.083 --> 1:27:30.833
Jess, can you come home already?
You're aging me!

1:27:33.458 --> 1:27:34.416
Yeah.

1:27:36.875 --> 1:27:37.958
I think I'm ready.

1:27:40.250 --> 1:27:43.041
She did it. She bloody did it!

1:27:43.125 --> 1:27:45.125
-Come here! Come here!

1:27:45.208 --> 1:27:47.000
-Jess…

1:27:47.083 --> 1:27:47.958
You see?

1:27:48.041 --> 1:27:49.666
You had us worried, Jessy.

1:27:55.958 --> 1:27:57.750
-Are we rolling?
-It's Hannah.

1:27:57.833 --> 1:27:59.791
Everyone ready?
You got the shot?

1:28:01.791 --> 1:28:06.250
Jess has made it through the storm.
She suffered no serious injuries or damage

1:28:06.333 --> 1:28:07.541
and is on her way home.

1:28:11.583 --> 1:28:13.250
-Yes!
-All right.

1:28:13.750 --> 1:28:16.708
All right. All right, all right,
everyone, off the lawn!

1:28:16.791 --> 1:28:18.375
All right, I'm trying to grow it.

1:31:20.666 --> 1:31:24.000
Over 80,000 people
crowd Sydney Harbor foreshore

1:31:24.083 --> 1:31:26.583
to see Jessica Watson, the schoolgirl,

1:31:26.666 --> 1:31:32.875
rather, the remarkable young woman
arrive home after 210 days at sea,

1:31:33.458 --> 1:31:36.541
a lesson in the power of inspiration,

1:31:36.625 --> 1:31:39.458
and the impact that one courageous soul

1:31:39.541 --> 1:31:41.166
can have on so many,

1:31:41.750 --> 1:31:42.750
including me.

1:31:43.666 --> 1:31:44.791
Here we go.

1:31:49.208 --> 1:31:50.958
-3:33.
-3:33.

1:31:51.041 --> 1:31:53.208
Breaker, breaker, she's in. 3:33.

1:32:06.500 --> 1:32:07.500
She did it.

1:32:09.166 --> 1:32:10.416
Yeah!

1:32:12.583 --> 1:32:13.750
Jess!

1:32:43.541 --> 1:32:45.291
<i>Jessica Watson crosses the line</i>

1:32:45.375 --> 1:32:46.958
<i>-after 24,000 nautical miles.</i>

1:32:47.041 --> 1:32:48.625
<i>-Completing her nonstop…</i>
-Oh!

1:32:52.875 --> 1:32:54.916
Here! Come, look! Look who's there!

1:32:55.000 --> 1:32:56.666
It's Jessica!

1:33:56.041 --> 1:33:57.208
You're home!

1:33:58.041 --> 1:33:59.083
You're really home!

1:34:14.958 --> 1:34:17.208
There's some people who want to say hi.

1:34:17.291 --> 1:34:19.000
-Oh! You got it.
-Hey.

1:34:19.083 --> 1:34:20.541
Hey! Jess!

1:34:28.875 --> 1:34:30.458
-Look at that!
-Come on!

1:34:35.041 --> 1:34:38.166
Welcome back, Jessica.
What a remarkable achievement.

1:34:38.250 --> 1:34:40.041
You've done our nation proud.

1:34:40.125 --> 1:34:43.291
You now stand tall
as Australia's newest hero.

1:34:48.166 --> 1:34:49.666
It's so great to be home.

1:34:51.041 --> 1:34:54.333
But I'm actually gonna disagree with what
the prime minister just said, I don't…

1:34:55.541 --> 1:34:57.541
I don't consider myself a hero.

1:34:57.625 --> 1:35:00.125
I'm just an ordinary girl
who believed in her dream.

1:35:00.666 --> 1:35:03.416
You don't have to be anyone special
to achieve something like this,

1:35:03.500 --> 1:35:05.500
you just have to find your dream,

1:35:05.583 --> 1:35:07.625
believe in it, and work really hard.

1:35:08.250 --> 1:35:09.750
Thank you for the amazing welcome.
