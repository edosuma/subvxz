WEBVTT

00:13.138 --> 00:15.224
Why do I have to go to this thing?

00:15.307 --> 00:17.726
If we want to be
a legitimate awards contender,

00:17.809 --> 00:20.687
<i>Secretariat </i>needs to make an appearance
at a big festival.

00:20.771 --> 00:23.106
-I can't just go to Cannes?
-You Cannes not.

00:23.190 --> 00:25.359
Apparently, the French do not care for you

00:25.442 --> 00:27.486
ever since you said that thing
in the press.

00:27.569 --> 00:29.696
Hey, I stand by my critique of Sartre.

00:29.780 --> 00:33.825
His philosophical arguments helped
tyrannical regimes justify overt cruelty.

00:33.909 --> 00:35.494
Also, the French smell and I hate them.

00:35.577 --> 00:38.789
And you can't go to Sundance
because Robert Redford hates you.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.625
Someone had to tell him
<i>The Horse Whisperer </i>was offensive.

00:41.708 --> 00:44.461
Sorry, but real horses don't just do
whatever someone says.

00:44.544 --> 00:47.256
And that's why you need to go
to this festival.

00:47.339 --> 00:48.882
If you say so.

00:48.966 --> 00:51.510
The Pacific Ocean Film Fest, or POFF,

00:51.593 --> 00:54.972
is the biggest underwater film festival
in the world.

00:55.055 --> 00:58.308
You make a splash there,
people are going to notice.

00:58.392 --> 00:59.309
Fine.

00:59.393 --> 01:02.521
All you need to do is get
to the premiere on time, 8:00.

01:02.604 --> 01:05.983
Walk the red carpet, wave at the crowd,
kiss some fish babies.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.943
Fish. They're so annoying.

01:08.026 --> 01:11.238
Sorry, lady. No <i>habla </i>fish talk.

01:11.321 --> 01:14.992
You need to be sensitive to their culture.
Things are different down there.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.369
You know what a thumb's up means, right?

01:17.452 --> 01:19.955
Yes, I know what a thumb's up means.
I'll be fine.

01:20.038 --> 01:21.790
Oh, I wanted to warn you.

01:21.873 --> 01:25.294
Kelsey Jannings
is also going to be at the festival.

01:25.377 --> 01:27.379
-Kelsey? No.
-She has another film there.

01:27.462 --> 01:30.007
I haven't talked to her
since she got fired from <i>Secretariat.</i>

01:30.090 --> 01:33.844
Well, luckily you won't have to talk much
because you'll both be underwater.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.013
God, I haven't been underwater

01:36.096 --> 01:38.932
since my mother tried to drown me
in the bathtub when I was 22.

01:39.016 --> 01:41.018
I can't do this, Ana. I'm sorry.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.436
-Sir.
-I'm getting off.

01:42.519 --> 01:45.314
You can't.
We've already pressurized the cabin.

01:45.397 --> 01:48.942
-Sir, please return to your seat.
-No. I don't want to do this.

01:49.026 --> 01:50.193
You can't make me.

01:50.277 --> 01:52.154
I'm a land creature.
I don't belong down there.

01:52.237 --> 01:54.364
You can lead me to water,
but you cannot make--

01:54.448 --> 01:55.574
Aaaah!
