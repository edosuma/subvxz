WEBVTT

00:09.092 --> 00:10.593
[Clark] No more secrets, right?

00:12.053 --> 00:16.056
So... Here's the rest of me.

00:16.140 --> 00:18.226
-[rumbling]
-[both gasp]

00:18.309 --> 00:19.894
[high-pitched voice] What?

00:19.978 --> 00:21.354
[obelisks thuds]

00:21.479 --> 00:24.649
I can't-- It's a ship!
Lois, it's a spaceship!

00:24.774 --> 00:26.151
Look at the pointy boys!

00:26.234 --> 00:27.527
They're obelisks.

00:27.652 --> 00:29.571
They project holograms
and transport material--

00:29.654 --> 00:32.656
[Jimmy] this is
the greatest day of my life!

00:33.950 --> 00:35.326
I know I lied.

00:35.452 --> 00:38.163
-I can't erase that.
-[Lois] Then we start over.

00:38.288 --> 00:40.498
Hey, big guy.
I'm Lois Lane.

00:40.582 --> 00:41.249
What's your name?

00:41.332 --> 00:42.250
[chuckles softly]

00:42.334 --> 00:44.336
Uh, Clark Kent.

00:44.461 --> 00:47.047
Though sometimes
I go by Superman.

00:47.172 --> 00:49.341
Wow, that seems
like a great name,

00:49.466 --> 00:52.844
given to you by someone
especially talented.

00:52.927 --> 00:53.887
Where do you come from?

00:54.012 --> 00:55.305
[Clark] Outer space.

00:55.388 --> 00:57.849
What planet or where,
I... I have no idea.

00:57.932 --> 00:59.184
What can you do?

00:59.267 --> 01:02.354
I'm still figuring
that out. [chuckles]

01:02.479 --> 01:06.649
Why did you
bring me here? Really.

01:06.733 --> 01:09.069
I brought you here
because there's no bad guys,

01:09.194 --> 01:11.112
no robots,
and absolutely nothing

01:11.196 --> 01:14.366
to interrupt me
when I ask you this,

01:14.491 --> 01:18.787
Lois Lane, will you go
on a date with me?

01:20.830 --> 01:22.791
[opening music playing]

01:44.604 --> 01:46.398
Have no fear,
your wingman is here.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.566
Let's get ready
for tonight's...

01:48.650 --> 01:51.069
[mumbling]
Okay, all right.

01:51.152 --> 01:54.197
So, what is
happening here, buddy?

01:54.280 --> 01:55.782
Jimmy! Great timing.

01:55.907 --> 01:57.450
You can help me
chart out the dates.

01:57.575 --> 01:59.035
-What?
-[Clark groans]

01:59.119 --> 02:00.537
This is our first
official date.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.247
So I've plotted
a route and timed it,

02:02.372 --> 02:03.665
because I'm taking Lois out

02:03.748 --> 02:05.792
for the most
romantic evening of her life.

02:05.917 --> 02:07.752
I'll fly in
to pick her up at 6:45.

02:07.877 --> 02:10.005
The cherry blossoms
in the Park bloom
at exactly seven o'clock,

02:10.088 --> 02:12.590
so we'll have 15 minutes to get
to the romantic rooftop view,

02:12.674 --> 02:14.968
which we'll savor
for, uh, 31 minutes

02:15.093 --> 02:16.011
before flying to Lois's

02:16.094 --> 02:17.429
favorite restaurant at 7:50

02:17.512 --> 02:18.930
for our 8:00 p.m. reservation,

02:19.014 --> 02:20.557
then coffee at 9:30!

02:20.640 --> 02:23.226
So, you finally got a date
with the girl of your dreams,

02:23.309 --> 02:25.978
and your first move
is to make a flow chart?

02:26.103 --> 02:27.480
And a map.

02:27.605 --> 02:30.191
Seems like you're putting
a lot of pressure on this.

02:30.275 --> 02:32.652
Well, it has to be perfect.

02:32.777 --> 02:33.611
Lois deserves it.

02:33.737 --> 02:36.197
One night
with no talking gorillas,

02:36.281 --> 02:37.991
or freeze-ray bank robbers.

02:38.116 --> 02:41.202
Just me and her.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.663
Oh, I forgot
about the swans
taking flight at 7:45.

02:43.788 --> 02:46.291
-Oh, okay. [mumbling]
-Well, have fun
losing your mind.

02:46.374 --> 02:47.459
I'm going to go
hang out at Lois's

02:47.584 --> 02:49.085
where it's normal, and--

02:49.168 --> 02:50.337
[Lois] Hmm, yeah.

02:50.462 --> 02:52.255
-Mmm-hmm.
-Nope. She's lost it too.

02:52.339 --> 02:55.633
Jimmy! Great.
I think I figured out
the perfect gift for Clark.

02:55.716 --> 02:59.262
Oh, a collection
of crazed notes
written on loose leaf paper.

02:59.346 --> 03:00.638
[Lois] No, no, no.

03:01.348 --> 03:02.974
His past.

03:03.099 --> 03:05.310
Every time I've hit a block,
Clark's been there for me,

03:05.435 --> 03:06.936
you know,
in one form or another.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.980
And I wanna give him back
something in return.

03:09.105 --> 03:10.690
I can't fly or fight robots.

03:10.815 --> 03:13.485
But investigating,
finding answers?
This is what I can do.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.487
I've started my research,
gonna crush it,

03:15.570 --> 03:17.781
and I'm ready
to meet Clark
ten minutes early.

03:17.864 --> 03:18.948
I'm perfect.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.034
Now, if you'll excuse me.

03:21.159 --> 03:22.619
[exclaims] Sweatpants!

03:22.702 --> 03:23.787
And there it is.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.997
Ugh! I left my dress
at the drycleaners.

03:26.831 --> 03:27.832
I'm gonna be late!

03:28.917 --> 03:31.503
[trilling]

03:31.586 --> 03:34.798
[tense music playing]

03:34.881 --> 03:36.591
Most of us own at least one
drycleanable item.

03:36.675 --> 03:40.011
Not all of us can wear
the same blue jacket every day.

03:40.095 --> 03:42.222
And done.

03:42.347 --> 03:45.100
I can do this.
It's just me and Lois,

03:45.183 --> 03:48.269
and no weird
Superman stuff
to ruin it. [laughs]

03:48.353 --> 03:49.521
[knocking on door]

03:51.022 --> 03:52.190
Superman.

03:52.273 --> 03:53.900
I'm Mr. Mxyzptlk,

03:54.025 --> 03:57.028
an interdimensional
peacekeeper,
and I need your help.

03:57.112 --> 03:57.987
[door shuts]

03:58.071 --> 03:59.531
Nope.

03:59.656 --> 04:01.199
I'm charged with the safety
of the multiverse, son.

04:01.282 --> 04:05.036
So I need you
to put on your suit
and come with me.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.871
Okay, look, I'm not Superman.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.707
-I'm just, uh...
-Mild-mannered Clark Kent.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.625
Wannabe reporter
with superpowers.

04:10.709 --> 04:14.713
Nice try, sport,
but Clark is Superman
in almost every reality,

04:14.796 --> 04:17.298
This Earth, Earth 12,
Earth 50, Earth 508,

04:17.382 --> 04:18.757
Weird Earth, the works.

04:19.718 --> 04:22.053
How did you... How did you...

04:22.178 --> 04:23.555
Was I a crab?

04:23.680 --> 04:25.890
There are
infinite universes
out there, pal,

04:26.016 --> 04:28.393
and infinite Supermen.

04:28.476 --> 04:30.854
But I'm here because
Lois Lane is in danger.

04:30.937 --> 04:33.982
Your Lois Lane.

04:34.065 --> 04:37.152
She's been kidnapped by a gang
of inter-dimensional criminals.

04:37.235 --> 04:39.070
-[Lois groaning]
-[Mr. Mxyzptlk] These people,

04:40.071 --> 04:41.489
they're ruthless.

04:41.573 --> 04:43.950
But if you're sure
you're not Superman--

04:45.159 --> 04:46.536
Where is she?

04:46.619 --> 04:48.997
I can get you to their hideout,
but, uh, oh...

04:49.080 --> 04:50.874
It's got measures
to stop me from portaling in.

04:50.957 --> 04:52.584
You'll have to break
through their security.

04:52.709 --> 04:55.462
Whatever it takes to save Lois.

04:55.587 --> 04:57.047
I knew I could count on you.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.590
You're the Dependable Clark.

04:58.673 --> 05:00.592
[chuckles] Now let's go.

05:03.595 --> 05:05.555
[both exclaiming]

05:08.058 --> 05:10.352
[cell phone buzzing]

05:13.605 --> 05:15.273
Huh. No response.

05:15.357 --> 05:17.317
Good. That gives me
time to change.

05:18.026 --> 05:18.860
[gasps]

05:20.111 --> 05:21.821
[intense music playing]

05:21.946 --> 05:24.366
[female voice] Lois Lane
and Jimmy Olsen of Earth 12,

05:24.449 --> 05:26.409
you need to come with us.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.953
Why? Who are you people?

05:29.537 --> 05:30.497
Lois Lane?

05:30.622 --> 05:31.790
I'm Lois Lane.

05:31.915 --> 05:34.542
That's Lois Lane.
And that's Lewis Lane.

05:34.626 --> 05:37.754
We are the
League of Lois Lanes.

05:37.837 --> 05:40.131
And your Clark Kent is
in danger.

05:41.216 --> 05:42.384
[Lois] Huh?

05:44.928 --> 05:46.471
[yells, grunts]

05:47.263 --> 05:48.890
[groaning]

05:48.973 --> 05:50.642
-Where are we?
-[Mr. Mxyzptlk panting]

05:50.725 --> 05:52.060
Hey! Are you okay?

05:52.143 --> 05:55.814
I'm fine. Just not
as strong as I used to be.

05:55.939 --> 05:56.940
[chuckles softly]

05:57.023 --> 05:58.983
And this is
the kidnapper's lair.

05:59.067 --> 06:00.902
They're... They're inside
and so is Lois.

06:00.985 --> 06:03.113
Quick, she doesn't
have much time.

06:04.572 --> 06:06.491
-[gate rumbles]
-[Clark grunts]

06:07.450 --> 06:08.702
Huh? Whoa!

06:09.536 --> 06:10.829
Oops! Ow!

06:10.912 --> 06:14.040
You gotta look out
for their guard dog, too.

06:14.165 --> 06:15.709
[trilling]

06:17.460 --> 06:20.046
[exhilarating music playing]

06:22.590 --> 06:24.801
[gasps] What?

06:24.884 --> 06:26.219
[Leader Lois]
Welcome to the flagship

06:26.344 --> 06:28.722
of the interdimensional
peacekeeping force,

06:28.847 --> 06:30.390
The League of Lois Lanes.

06:30.515 --> 06:31.933
[device beeps]

06:32.017 --> 06:33.977
We were founded
by Lois Prime,

06:34.060 --> 06:36.855
the first Lois
to discover the multiverse.

06:36.938 --> 06:39.107
We protect every dimension,

06:39.190 --> 06:42.694
recruiting only
the best Loises to help.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.571
Usually after
our first Pulitzer,

06:44.696 --> 06:46.114
around our 21st birthday.

06:46.197 --> 06:47.782
Oh, um, I'm... I'm 23.

06:47.866 --> 06:51.661
So... You were reporters
before then?

06:51.745 --> 06:52.954
Ooh, which Lois are you?

06:53.038 --> 06:54.622
-My name's Jalana Olsen.
-[Jimmy gasps]

06:54.706 --> 06:57.125
And unfortunately,
it seems I'm you.

06:57.207 --> 07:00.378
Many Olsens are also
a part of the league.

07:00.503 --> 07:02.756
This brings us
to why you're here.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.508
This is Mxyzptlk.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.719
He calls himself a "Chaos God."

07:07.802 --> 07:10.972
We managed to disarm him,
but as we were taking him in,

07:11.056 --> 07:15.477
a portal opened
to a previously
unknown universe, yours.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.187
He escaped into it.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.480
If I ever get my hands

07:18.563 --> 07:20.023
on the jerks
who helped that gorilla

07:20.106 --> 07:22.734
and the brain who
opened that stupid portal--

07:22.859 --> 07:25.070
Why do you need us
for this Mr. Mxyzptlk?

07:25.195 --> 07:27.781
Because your Clark
is helping him.

07:27.906 --> 07:30.867
What? Clark would
never help a bad guy.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.369
[scoffs]

07:32.452 --> 07:33.703
No one's saying that.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.663
But we tracked Mxy here,

07:35.747 --> 07:38.625
and now your Clark
and Mxy are missing.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.210
Lois, we need your help.

07:40.293 --> 07:43.171
To find him, of course!
I'll do what I do best,

07:43.254 --> 07:44.631
investigate. Ah!

07:45.507 --> 07:46.841
[computer trilling]

07:50.011 --> 07:51.221
Excellent.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.848
Once the scanner analyzes
your dimensions' tachyons,

07:53.932 --> 07:55.600
we'll be able
to find your Clark.

07:55.683 --> 07:58.186
Oh. That's what you needed.

07:58.269 --> 07:59.312
Good. Great.

07:59.437 --> 08:01.648
If it helps Clark, then--

08:01.731 --> 08:05.402
You have no idea
what you're dealing with,
do you?

08:05.485 --> 08:07.028
Not now.

08:08.279 --> 08:10.281
[chuckles] Give us
a moment, will ya?

08:10.365 --> 08:12.951
-In the meantime,
make yourself at home.
-[Jimmy whoops]

08:14.703 --> 08:16.121
Just not in there.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.541
[device warbling]

08:24.754 --> 08:28.299
[gasps, chuckles]

08:28.425 --> 08:29.551
[Clark grunts]

08:29.634 --> 08:30.802
-Ah!
-Great.

08:30.927 --> 08:33.263
Now, you smash and I grab.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.558
Wait. Are...
Are you robbing this place?

08:36.640 --> 08:39.436
[laughs] No. Of course not.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.520
We're robbing this place.

08:41.645 --> 08:44.232
-What? No.
-Hey, look,
there's the good stuff.

08:44.315 --> 08:46.234
-[clattering]
-[grunts]

08:49.237 --> 08:51.239
Where is Lois?

08:51.322 --> 08:53.533
Metropolis, probably.
How should I know?

08:53.658 --> 08:56.828
Ooh, Cosmic Rod, Flight Ring...

08:57.328 --> 08:58.163
Ah!

08:59.706 --> 09:01.583
Here we go.

09:01.666 --> 09:04.002
Lois was never
in danger, was she?

09:04.085 --> 09:07.839
No. Lois was never in danger.

09:07.964 --> 09:10.091
I deceived you. I lied.

09:10.175 --> 09:11.426
Why?

09:11.509 --> 09:14.220
Because portal-proof vaults
are a huge inconvenience,

09:14.346 --> 09:16.681
and you are very strong.

09:16.765 --> 09:20.852
[chuckles]
But you're not the quickest guy
from planet Krypton, are you?

09:20.977 --> 09:25.190
Wha... uh... Krypton?
Is... Is that where--

09:25.315 --> 09:26.608
Help me break this glass.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.443
-No!
-Oh, that's okay.

09:28.526 --> 09:30.195
I got it. [grunts] Yeah.

09:31.363 --> 09:32.655
[snickers]

09:35.367 --> 09:36.868
-Stop!
-[exclaims]

09:36.951 --> 09:39.621
You are going to put that back,
and I will turn you over

09:39.704 --> 09:41.373
to whatever authorities
deal with you,

09:41.498 --> 09:46.878
and then Lois and I
are going on a perfect,
normal date!

09:47.003 --> 09:49.214
[laughs]

09:49.297 --> 09:53.301
Normal? You are never
going to be normal.

09:53.385 --> 09:55.178
I have seen countless yous,

09:55.261 --> 09:58.556
and it is your fate
to always be different,

09:58.640 --> 10:00.725
and weird, and alone.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.727
And you may be
stronger than me,

10:02.811 --> 10:04.229
but can you stop me?

10:04.312 --> 10:06.106
[snickers] I think...

10:06.231 --> 10:07.899
[groans]

10:09.984 --> 10:11.403
-[shuddering]
-[sighs]

10:11.528 --> 10:13.571
You're not okay.

10:13.655 --> 10:16.533
No. I lost something
dear to me.

10:16.616 --> 10:19.035
I'm less... than I was,

10:19.119 --> 10:22.414
but strong enough
for one last trick.

10:24.249 --> 10:25.917
No, no, no!

10:26.001 --> 10:27.127
Hey!

10:27.252 --> 10:28.878
I thought now would be
a perfect time to get

10:28.962 --> 10:30.797
some footage
for my next Flamebird update.

10:30.922 --> 10:34.592
This week's episode
is definitely gonna be
about the multiverse.

10:34.718 --> 10:36.720
Wait. You're a Flamebird?

10:36.803 --> 10:38.763
Out of all the Olsens
in the multiverse,

10:38.847 --> 10:40.432
I've never met another one.

10:40.515 --> 10:41.850
Oh, what's the coolest thing
you've seen?

10:41.933 --> 10:43.143
Mine's the decaying remains

10:43.268 --> 10:44.978
of the secret
government laboratory

10:45.103 --> 10:46.521
that definitely did not have
a gorilla or a brain in it.

10:46.604 --> 10:48.440
Telepathic Horse!

10:48.565 --> 10:50.108
I'll show you!

10:50.191 --> 10:51.609
-Don't, don't make us watch.
-Not... Not again! Come on.

10:51.693 --> 10:54.779
Ha-ha! It's time, bird-lievers!

10:54.904 --> 10:58.283
Equus Mensa. Hippos Telepathia.

10:58.366 --> 10:59.367
Comet.

10:59.451 --> 11:01.286
The telepathic horse
has many names.

11:01.369 --> 11:05.040
All right.
What are you hiding?

11:07.792 --> 11:09.627
[system trilling]

11:09.711 --> 11:13.757
[automated voice]
Lois, Earth 52, multiple
award-winning reporter.

11:13.840 --> 11:17.969
Earth 24, received key
to the city at 19.

11:18.094 --> 11:21.222
Lois, Earth 1,
"Ready to meet with Dad."

11:22.265 --> 11:23.808
Hmm.

11:23.933 --> 11:27.687
"Superman-File X. Redacted?"

11:27.812 --> 11:29.189
What does that mean?

11:29.314 --> 11:32.609
Restricted.
Access at headquarters only.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.402
So, where is headquarters?

11:35.945 --> 11:37.989
[Leader Lois in distance]
Everybody downstairs!

11:40.992 --> 11:42.786
[system trilling]

11:42.869 --> 11:44.537
[Leader Lois]
Analysis complete.

11:44.662 --> 11:46.623
We found Mxy and Clark.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.334
They just jumped to Earth 14...

11:49.459 --> 11:53.380
after robbing
Earth Prime's Space
and Superhero Museum.

11:53.505 --> 11:54.839
I knew it.

11:54.964 --> 11:57.384
No, this... this has to be
a misunderstanding.

11:57.509 --> 11:58.468
You know Clark.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.053
Your Clarks.

12:00.178 --> 12:03.640
You know he'd never do
something like this, uh, right?

12:03.723 --> 12:08.186
Maybe you don't know Superman
as well as you think you do.

12:08.311 --> 12:10.438
-[system trilling]
-Coordinates set.

12:10.522 --> 12:11.690
League, get ready.

12:11.815 --> 12:13.650
We go after them
in three, two...

12:13.733 --> 12:15.026
[whooshes]

12:19.781 --> 12:21.366
[Mr. Mxyzptlk]
The scene is set.

12:21.449 --> 12:26.371
All we have to do... [coughs]
is wait for them to show up.

12:26.496 --> 12:27.622
Wait for who to show up?

12:27.706 --> 12:29.165
-[wind blowing]
-[Clark yells]

12:36.631 --> 12:37.841
So what do we do?

12:37.924 --> 12:39.759
Uh, what are those?

12:39.884 --> 12:41.886
Only thing
that'll take down a Clark.

12:41.970 --> 12:43.513
What do you mean, take down?

12:43.596 --> 12:45.390
Neutralize the Kryptonian.

12:45.515 --> 12:47.892
He's too powerful
to give the benefit
of the doubt.

12:48.018 --> 12:49.686
No. I won't let you do this.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.312
-We know.
-[gasps]

12:53.064 --> 12:55.400
You didn't grab us to help you.

12:56.401 --> 12:57.736
[gun cocks]

12:57.819 --> 13:00.030
Lois, you're not
league material,

13:00.113 --> 13:03.074
but you're enough
like us to cause problems.

13:03.199 --> 13:04.242
Keep 'em separated.

13:05.660 --> 13:07.412
[muffled] No! Let me out!

13:07.537 --> 13:09.372
Don't do this!

13:09.456 --> 13:13.084
-Watch Olsen.
He could be trouble.
-[Jalana] Hmm.

13:13.168 --> 13:18.089
[Mr. Mxyzptlk] Well, well.
If it isn't Lois, Lois,
and what's his name?

13:18.173 --> 13:20.258
But there's
something wrong
with this picture.

13:20.383 --> 13:23.928
All these Loises
and not one Clark.

13:24.387 --> 13:25.221
Got you.

13:26.431 --> 13:27.932
It's him. Fire!

13:29.017 --> 13:31.269
Ah! [grunts]

13:31.353 --> 13:32.687
-[gun fires]
-[Clark yelling]

13:32.771 --> 13:34.564
[both grunting]

13:35.648 --> 13:37.150
[groans]

13:37.859 --> 13:40.612
What is... this?

13:40.737 --> 13:41.863
[gasps]

13:41.946 --> 13:43.865
-Clark!
-No, Jimmy.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.784
I thought we were Flamebros.

13:45.909 --> 13:47.118
I'm sorry.

13:47.202 --> 13:50.747
[Clark groaning, gasping]

13:50.830 --> 13:52.874
The Clark is neutralized.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.126
Now for you, criminal--

13:55.710 --> 13:57.545
What? Spread out!

13:57.629 --> 13:59.798
He still has
some of his illusion powers!

13:59.923 --> 14:01.257
We don't stop until we find--

14:01.341 --> 14:03.802
-[portal whooshing]
-[spaceship whirring]

14:03.885 --> 14:06.262
Our Lois is still aboard!

14:10.600 --> 14:12.268
No!

14:12.352 --> 14:13.978
[Leader Lois] Lewis,
rig our gauntlets

14:14.062 --> 14:15.730
to pierce the space
between worlds.

14:15.814 --> 14:17.232
We can't let Mxy get away.

14:17.315 --> 14:19.609
I'll keep an eye on Superman.

14:23.571 --> 14:24.322
Yes! [chuckles]

14:24.406 --> 14:27.158
And Mxy lived happily ever--

14:27.283 --> 14:28.743
-[gun cocks]
-[gasps]

14:28.827 --> 14:32.664
You've got exactly ten seconds
to turn this ship around.

14:32.747 --> 14:34.499
Oh, come on!

14:34.624 --> 14:37.836
I went through
some really excellent lies

14:37.919 --> 14:40.755
to avoid this exact scenario.

14:40.839 --> 14:43.383
Caught by
Participation Trophy Lois.

14:43.508 --> 14:45.176
[automated voice]
Coordinates requested,

14:45.301 --> 14:46.761
League Headquarters.

14:46.845 --> 14:48.763
Master Key required.

14:48.847 --> 14:50.473
Wait. League Headquarters.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.434
-You know where it is?
-I don't.

14:52.517 --> 14:54.060
But Lois Prime did.

14:54.185 --> 14:56.021
Which is why
I nabbed her recorder.

14:58.606 --> 15:00.608
You're not gonna try
to stop me.

15:00.692 --> 15:04.320
The other Loises
are hiding something
from me about Superman.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.531
So you're gonna take us to HQ

15:06.656 --> 15:09.034
and I'm gonna
find out what it is.

15:09.159 --> 15:10.869
You met a legion of yourself,

15:10.952 --> 15:15.290
and the first thing you did
was suspect them of lying?

15:15.373 --> 15:17.542
Lois Prime would've loved you.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.252
And why is that?

15:19.377 --> 15:22.505
Because she didn't trust
anyone either,

15:22.589 --> 15:25.550
which is why she kept
a secret backup master key.

15:25.675 --> 15:28.762
And now I know
which Lois you are.

15:28.887 --> 15:30.930
You're the fun one!

15:44.152 --> 15:47.238
This place is beautiful.

15:47.364 --> 15:49.491
Eh, it's a little pretentious,
in my opinion.

15:49.574 --> 15:51.242
I know I can't trust
anything you say,

15:51.326 --> 15:53.078
but I might as well ask,

15:53.995 --> 15:56.081
what do you know about Clark?

15:56.164 --> 16:00.669
Lots. But it'll be way more fun
to watch you figure it out.

16:03.797 --> 16:05.256
[door closes]

16:09.678 --> 16:11.888
Here you go.
The knowledge of the multiverse

16:11.971 --> 16:13.306
at your fingertips.

16:16.101 --> 16:17.310
[typing]

16:20.689 --> 16:21.981
This is a file?

16:22.107 --> 16:24.109
How... How does...
How does it work?

16:24.234 --> 16:25.652
What am I supposed
to do with this?

16:26.903 --> 16:29.030
[sensors buzzing]

16:29.114 --> 16:30.156
-[beeps]
-[gasps]

16:30.615 --> 16:31.783
Ah!

16:31.908 --> 16:33.952
[grunting]

16:34.077 --> 16:36.955
Sorry, Fun Lois,
It's been real--

16:37.080 --> 16:40.500
But it's now time
to take back what's mine.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.215
I'm back!

16:47.298 --> 16:49.134
[laughs maliciously]

16:51.594 --> 16:53.304
[panting]

16:53.430 --> 16:54.347
[screams]

16:54.472 --> 16:55.640
[yelling]

16:56.391 --> 16:57.559
[groans]

16:57.642 --> 17:00.061
Now, I'm going to need
to get you off my back.

17:00.145 --> 17:02.480
[chuckles] All of you.

17:02.564 --> 17:04.148
-So...
-[sensor beeps]

17:04.232 --> 17:07.152
[system buzzing]

17:09.362 --> 17:12.574
Oh, look.
It's the League of Loser Lanes

17:12.656 --> 17:14.117
getting in my way.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.661
-Lois.
-No, he's got the hat!

17:19.830 --> 17:21.207
[evil laughter]

17:27.630 --> 17:28.715
[all grunting]

17:29.966 --> 17:31.051
[Clark grunts]

17:36.306 --> 17:37.390
I'm so glad you're okay.

17:37.515 --> 17:39.100
[both] I'm sorry
I ruined our date.

17:39.184 --> 17:40.810
No, Lois, this is my fault.

17:40.894 --> 17:43.188
I wanted to give you
a normal first date

17:43.271 --> 17:45.148
without any Superman weirdness,

17:45.231 --> 17:47.192
but I... I ruined it
before it even started.

17:47.275 --> 17:49.194
No, no, no. I'm sorry.

17:49.319 --> 17:51.946
I've seen the files.
I'm literally the worst Lois

17:52.030 --> 17:53.281
-in the multiverse.
-[Clark] No.

17:53.365 --> 17:54.783
You would be better off
with anyone else.

17:54.866 --> 17:56.451
Lois...

17:56.534 --> 17:57.869
You're the only Lois for me.

17:57.994 --> 17:59.079
I'm annoying.

17:59.204 --> 18:01.206
You're dedicated. I'm weird.

18:01.289 --> 18:02.624
You're amazing.

18:02.707 --> 18:05.877
I love going on
adventures with you, Clark.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.212
I love your brilliance.

18:07.295 --> 18:08.838
I love your kindness.

18:08.922 --> 18:09.881
I love...

18:10.590 --> 18:11.591
I love...

18:13.051 --> 18:14.511
[fireworks bursting]

18:18.139 --> 18:19.849
Hey, not to be a bummer,

18:19.933 --> 18:22.977
but could you stop
making out before
the Chaos God blows us up!

18:39.077 --> 18:39.911
I have an idea!

18:40.036 --> 18:41.705
[Mr. Mxyzptlk laughing]

18:43.248 --> 18:44.332
Huh?

18:46.793 --> 18:48.420
Enough of this.

19:13.611 --> 19:15.947
Goodbye, Dependable Clark.

19:16.072 --> 19:21.119
Hello, Mxyzptlk, God of Chaos.

19:21.244 --> 19:23.371
You're not strong enough
to best me.

19:23.455 --> 19:25.915
[Clark] But I am
strong enough... [groans]

19:25.999 --> 19:27.459
for one last trick.

19:30.962 --> 19:31.921

19:49.647 --> 19:52.817
[sighs] It's over, Mxy.

19:52.942 --> 19:54.778
As for you three--

19:54.861 --> 19:56.988
-Where did they go?
-Sorry, Captain.

19:57.113 --> 19:58.990
They grabbed a gauntlet
while we were busy.

19:59.115 --> 20:02.077
The computer's too fried
to find their universe's
coordinates again.

20:02.160 --> 20:06.748
Ugh! Let's just put
this one in confinement
and call it a day.

Yes! You can always
trust the Flamebro

20:14.506 --> 20:16.007
to have your back.

What time is it?

-...so tired. [chuckles]

20:23.223 --> 20:24.766
Uh, better go. Bye.

20:26.935 --> 20:27.852
[exclaims softly]

20:29.229 --> 20:32.023
So, uh, Lois, um...

20:32.107 --> 20:35.610
It's too late for dinner,
but I was thinking...

20:37.445 --> 20:39.030
Treat me to coffee, Smallville?

20:45.036 --> 20:45.954
[sighs]

What?

[people screaming]

21:15.567 --> 21:17.318
Have you figured it out yet?

21:17.819 --> 21:19.279
[gasps]

21:19.404 --> 21:20.613
Weren't you in jail?

21:20.739 --> 21:22.991
I was! It didn't take.

21:23.074 --> 21:25.618
Besides, your drama
is too fun to miss.

21:27.704 --> 21:29.205
Is this some kind of trick?

21:29.289 --> 21:31.499
Oh, no. It's the truth.

21:31.583 --> 21:35.295
Just like not
every Lois wins a Pulitzer...

21:37.255 --> 21:40.008
Not every Superman is good.

21:43.345 --> 21:44.763
[Mr. Mxyzptlk snickers]

21:46.056 --> 21:47.974
This just got interesting.

21:48.058 --> 21:49.768
-What is it?
-Sorry.

21:49.893 --> 21:53.063
It'll be much more fun
to watch you figure it out.

21:53.146 --> 21:54.856
[chuckles] Ta-ta!

21:58.443 --> 22:01.404
[dramatic music playing]
