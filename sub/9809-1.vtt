00:42.483 --> 00:46.852
Ok, you're gonna meet
your new Daddy.

00:46.953 --> 00:48.286
Uh, have you seen Jackson?

00:48.387 --> 00:49.254
I think he's down there.

00:49.355 --> 00:50.888
Thanks.

00:56.260 --> 00:57.259
Hey.

00:57.360 --> 00:59.261
Hey, beautiful.

00:59.362 --> 01:02.029
It's your birthday party
and you are working.

01:02.130 --> 01:02.730
Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:02.831 --> 01:03.963
I'm almost done.

01:04.065 --> 01:06.066
This is a hybrid of vitis
venifera and vitis riparia.

01:06.167 --> 01:07.933
She's very delicate.

01:08.034 --> 01:09.234
What is that?

01:12.838 --> 01:18.107
A birthday Valentine's Day
hybrid gift.

01:18.208 --> 01:19.808
You got me a puppy?

01:22.011 --> 01:23.277
Wow, this is a big step.

01:23.378 --> 01:23.911
It's-

01:24.012 --> 01:24.878
Yeah.

01:24.979 --> 01:25.846
Like we adopted a furry baby
together.

01:27.147 --> 01:28.414
Big step.

01:30.983 --> 01:32.617
Thank you.

01:32.718 --> 01:33.918
Well, let me clean up.

01:48.830 --> 01:51.030
Look how cute she is sleeping.

01:51.131 --> 01:52.797
She is adorable.

01:52.898 --> 01:54.065
Hey, how did the interview go?

01:54.166 --> 01:55.300
She made me an offer.

01:55.400 --> 01:56.333
That's incredible!

01:56.434 --> 01:58.402
And she said that I could start
in two weeks.

01:58.503 --> 02:00.136
I am so proud of you!

02:00.237 --> 02:03.038
People kill to work with
real estate guru Nancy Spencer.

02:03.139 --> 02:04.306
But I'm not so sure about
being an agent

02:04.407 --> 02:05.806
at such a large company.

02:05.907 --> 02:06.741
Are you kidding me?

02:06.842 --> 02:07.875
The first year is a review.

02:07.976 --> 02:09.642
They could let me go
without a reason.

02:09.744 --> 02:10.776
It would never happen.

02:10.877 --> 02:12.344
You're brilliant.

02:12.445 --> 02:15.847
And the timing is not
so good.

02:15.948 --> 02:17.982
Ok, what's stopping you?

02:18.082 --> 02:20.217
The job is at the New Mexico
head office.

02:20.318 --> 02:21.184
So?

02:21.285 --> 02:24.686
All your friends live
in New Mexico.

02:24.787 --> 02:26.454
But you don't.

02:30.325 --> 02:31.457
Thanks.

02:34.260 --> 02:35.761
Come on.

02:37.829 --> 02:38.963
Molly, listen to me.

02:39.064 --> 02:40.364
I know this is important to you.

02:40.465 --> 02:41.931
If we need to move,
we'll move.

02:42.032 --> 02:43.266
But you love San Francisco.

02:43.367 --> 02:44.600
Plus, you'll need to find a job.

02:44.701 --> 02:45.667
I've got my doctorate.

02:45.802 --> 02:49.070
If that doesn't work out
I'll be a sommelier.

02:49.171 --> 02:51.138
Are you sure about this?

02:51.239 --> 02:53.773
As long as we're together.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.841
Grab a seat.

03:03.348 --> 03:05.848
Molly, you know I'm horrible
at giving chocolates

03:05.949 --> 03:08.183
and flowers and being-

03:08.284 --> 03:09.084
Being on time.

03:09.185 --> 03:10.084
Being on time.

03:10.185 --> 03:11.285
And-

03:11.386 --> 03:12.720
And you let people take
advantage of your good nature.

03:12.821 --> 03:16.989
And I'm no good at expressing
how I feel.

03:17.090 --> 03:18.991
I have something for you.

03:19.092 --> 03:21.826
Jackson, it's your birthday,
not mine.

03:24.128 --> 03:26.796
But it's also Valentine's Day.

03:26.897 --> 03:32.933
True love is often spoken
but seldom found.

03:33.034 --> 03:39.037
And I believe with all my heart
I've found love with you.

03:39.138 --> 03:41.306
Wow.

03:41.407 --> 03:46.676
I thought you said you weren't
good at expressing yourself.

03:46.777 --> 03:47.811
I wrote cheat notes.

03:50.180 --> 03:51.680
Jackson, you can't afford this.

03:51.781 --> 03:53.614
I can afford it.

03:53.715 --> 03:57.751
It's... it's beautiful.

03:57.852 --> 04:00.219
You really don't need
to buy me things.

04:00.320 --> 04:01.953
That's why you deserve it.

04:02.054 --> 04:05.856
Besides, it's Valentine's Day.

04:05.957 --> 04:07.658
<i>Jackson!</i>

04:07.759 --> 04:10.660
Has anyone seen Jackson?

04:10.761 --> 04:11.827
Vanessa?

04:11.928 --> 04:14.296
Isn't that your ex
that cheated on you?

04:14.397 --> 04:15.863
Yeah.

04:17.833 --> 04:18.998
Jackson.

04:20.634 --> 04:22.034
Will you get us another bottle
of wine?

04:22.135 --> 04:22.935
Sure, what kind?

04:23.036 --> 04:24.002
Red.

04:24.103 --> 04:27.637
Just give me five minutes
to deal with this.

04:27.738 --> 04:28.171
Ok.

04:28.272 --> 04:29.739
Thanks.

04:32.042 --> 04:33.309
Jackson, I've been calling.

04:33.410 --> 04:35.109
I changed my number.

04:35.211 --> 04:36.277
It's been almost a year.

04:37.345 --> 04:38.478
Vanessa, listen.

04:38.580 --> 04:39.780
It's my birthday, I've got
people over, this is kind of-

04:39.881 --> 04:41.013
Ok, no. We need to talk.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.749
Now. In private.

04:43.850 --> 04:45.283
Ok, come on.

04:47.986 --> 04:48.886
I haven't seen you in months.

04:48.987 --> 04:49.920
Why now?

04:50.021 --> 04:51.654
Because I had a baby
two weeks ago.

04:51.755 --> 04:52.555
Wow.

04:52.656 --> 04:53.956
Vanessa, I am really happy
for you,

04:54.057 --> 04:55.824
but what does that have
to do with me?

04:55.925 --> 04:56.758
Everything.

04:56.859 --> 04:58.292
What are you talking about?

04:58.393 --> 04:59.894
Cody isn't Kyle's father.

04:59.995 --> 05:02.229
Oh, the truth comes out.

05:02.330 --> 05:03.963
So, who else did you sleep with,
hmm?

05:04.064 --> 05:04.864
Mike? Ted?

05:04.965 --> 05:06.831
No, no, no, it was Paul
wasn't it?

05:06.932 --> 05:09.133
It's you, Jackson.

05:09.235 --> 05:10.934
The DNA results came in
this week.

05:11.035 --> 05:13.135
You are the father.

05:13.237 --> 05:15.071
What?

05:15.172 --> 05:16.805
You're a father?

05:16.906 --> 05:17.239
No.

05:17.340 --> 05:18.073
No!

05:18.174 --> 05:19.040
Yes, he is.

05:19.141 --> 05:20.641
Kyle Jackson Wheeler.

05:20.742 --> 05:21.508
No, it's impossible.

05:21.610 --> 05:23.109
We broke up over a year ago!

05:23.210 --> 05:24.911
Ten months ago I came over.

05:25.012 --> 05:25.978
You were there for me.

05:26.079 --> 05:27.045
You comforted me.

05:27.146 --> 05:28.547
Tell me it's not true.

05:28.648 --> 05:30.147
Molly, I am so sorry.

05:30.249 --> 05:32.216
She came over, she told me
her father died,

05:32.317 --> 05:33.984
I was helping,
and then wine,

05:34.085 --> 05:35.218
and then one thing
led to another.

05:35.319 --> 05:36.552
I- I felt terrible and it was-

05:36.653 --> 05:37.353
It was love.

05:37.454 --> 05:38.687
No, no, no, it's not like that.

05:38.788 --> 05:39.654
Maybe it is like that.

05:39.755 --> 05:40.788
Woah, woah, woah.

05:40.890 --> 05:43.190
She was totally lying,
her father isn't even dead.

05:43.291 --> 05:44.725
He was dead to me.

05:44.826 --> 05:46.058
I believed that you loved me.

05:46.159 --> 05:48.227
Molly, listen to me, please.

05:48.328 --> 05:50.128
You and I were just friends
back then.

05:50.229 --> 05:51.929
You are the father, Jackson.

05:52.030 --> 05:54.164
The odds of that are
completely ridiculous!

05:54.266 --> 05:56.299
I have papers!

06:00.737 --> 06:01.602
Bye, Jackson.

06:01.703 --> 06:02.169
Molly, wait!

06:02.271 --> 06:02.803
Hey, hey!

06:02.905 --> 06:03.604
You know what?

06:03.705 --> 06:04.705
Just leave it alone.

06:04.806 --> 06:05.805
Maybe it's better this way.

06:05.907 --> 06:07.173
I want that DNA test.

06:07.275 --> 06:08.874
Ok, fine.

06:08.975 --> 06:11.210
But you are the father.

06:15.647 --> 06:16.480
Molly, wait!

06:16.581 --> 06:17.247
Leave me alone!

06:17.348 --> 06:18.514
It's not what you think!

06:18.615 --> 06:19.548
No, it's worse!

06:19.650 --> 06:21.016
You cheated on me
and now you have a kid!

06:21.117 --> 06:23.118
Back then you and I hadn't even
kissed yet!

06:23.219 --> 06:24.885
I was taking things slow!

06:26.054 --> 06:29.022
Let's talk about this!

06:29.123 --> 06:29.889
Molly, please.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.957
Please don't do this.

06:32.058 --> 06:33.091
Please talk to me.

06:33.192 --> 06:33.692
Please.

06:33.793 --> 06:34.692
No, no, no, no, no.

06:34.793 --> 06:35.493
Don't do this.

06:35.594 --> 06:36.494
No, no, no.

06:36.595 --> 06:38.161
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly,
I love you!

06:38.262 --> 06:39.729
What did you say?

06:39.830 --> 06:41.196
I love you.

06:41.298 --> 06:42.131
Love hurts.

06:42.265 --> 06:44.098
Please, please, please,
I can explain.

06:44.199 --> 06:45.099
Oww!

06:45.200 --> 06:47.334
Aaargh!!!!

06:51.071 --> 06:52.672
No!

09:15.271 --> 09:16.937
Hey, baby.

09:17.039 --> 09:18.439
What're you doing?

09:18.540 --> 09:19.539
Greg, what am I doing?

09:19.640 --> 09:21.441
What are you doing
in my shower?

09:21.542 --> 09:22.541
Aw, honey bunny.

09:22.675 --> 09:24.910
I came by to drop off a gift
after racquetball.

09:25.011 --> 09:26.144
I didn't want to wake you.

09:26.245 --> 09:27.678
Well, we have rules.

09:27.780 --> 09:29.846
You know how I feel
about my space.

09:29.947 --> 09:32.748
I know, but we've been together
almost a year.

09:32.849 --> 09:34.116
You really should let me
move in.

09:34.217 --> 09:35.351
I can't deal with this
right now.

09:35.451 --> 09:38.186
I have to meet with some
billionaire and I can't be late.

09:38.287 --> 09:39.153
Billionaire?

09:39.254 --> 09:40.154
One of Nancy's clients.

09:40.255 --> 09:41.422
I did this thing that got me
some attention

09:41.523 --> 09:42.955
and now he wants to meet.

09:43.057 --> 09:43.890
Why am I telling you this?

09:43.991 --> 09:45.524
I have to go.

09:45.625 --> 09:49.126
First I have something for you.

09:49.227 --> 09:50.828
Here.

09:53.964 --> 09:54.764
These are huge.

09:54.864 --> 09:56.732
Greg, this is too much.

09:56.833 --> 09:58.833
Score one for the Rickster.

09:58.934 --> 09:59.700
Rickster?

09:59.802 --> 10:01.169
Rick hooked me up.

10:01.270 --> 10:03.737
These were found backstage
at a Beyonce concert.

10:03.838 --> 10:04.937
Check it out.

10:05.038 --> 10:07.839
This one has a little "J"

10:07.940 --> 10:10.842
and there's a little "Z"
on the other.

10:10.943 --> 10:12.709
I'm going to prison.

10:12.811 --> 10:14.044
So you like 'em?

10:14.145 --> 10:15.678
Yes, I love them.

10:15.779 --> 10:16.245
Thank you.

10:16.346 --> 10:17.979
They're beautiful.

10:18.081 --> 10:19.681
Now please leave.

10:21.249 --> 10:22.917
Oh, uh...

10:23.018 --> 10:24.918
Molly?

10:27.987 --> 10:29.121
I love you.

10:29.222 --> 10:30.988
<i>I love you, too.</i>

10:44.833 --> 10:47.133
This is another property
that I was wanting to show you.

10:47.234 --> 10:50.068
I think it's a fabulous,
fabulous location.

10:50.169 --> 10:51.736
Oh, Molly!

10:51.838 --> 10:52.971
Wow, perfect timing.

10:53.072 --> 10:54.505
I know it's a little unorthodox,

10:54.606 --> 10:56.639
but I'd like to introduce you to
Randall Slade,

10:56.740 --> 10:58.007
he's our newest client.

10:58.109 --> 10:59.775
A pleasure.

10:59.876 --> 11:00.709
Hey, Molly.

11:00.810 --> 11:03.845
I am totally stoked to meet you.

11:03.946 --> 11:07.614
I am just so stoked,
as well.

11:07.715 --> 11:09.582
I wish I could be there
in person,

11:09.683 --> 11:12.084
but I had this tech convention
scheduled in Japan.

11:12.185 --> 11:14.686
In fact, we've got, like,

11:14.787 --> 11:17.588
96 seconds to
talk so let's do it.

11:17.689 --> 11:20.089
Randall is the inventor of
Wipeout.

11:20.190 --> 11:21.524
Wipeout...

11:21.625 --> 11:22.991
It's the hottest new dating app.

11:23.092 --> 11:24.793
It's like a video pitch.

11:24.894 --> 11:26.894
You have to make an
impression in, like, ten seconds

11:26.995 --> 11:29.696
or you get crunched
by a giant wave.

11:29.797 --> 11:32.598
Wow, that's... fast.

11:32.699 --> 11:33.132
Yeah.

11:33.266 --> 11:34.166
I came up with it

11:34.267 --> 11:35.933
when a cruncher knocked
me off my board.

11:36.034 --> 11:37.435
You should totally try it.

11:37.536 --> 11:38.969
I have a boyfriend.

11:39.070 --> 11:41.004
Randall has some
investment ideas.

11:41.105 --> 11:44.039
I've gained this affinity for
wine and I want to own a label,

11:44.141 --> 11:46.040
from vine to bottle,
the whole lot.

11:46.142 --> 11:48.475
And he would like you to
handle the purchase.

11:48.576 --> 11:49.343
Yeah.

11:49.444 --> 11:51.511
I heard you made Cotter sick
cash

11:51.612 --> 11:53.779
on a lame-o mini-golf course
so I figured

11:53.881 --> 11:57.215
why not give Nancy's new hot
shot agent a go?

11:57.316 --> 12:00.718
I used to date a guy who
managed a vineyard.

12:00.819 --> 12:02.485
You see that?

12:02.586 --> 12:04.953
I had the old feeling inside
you were right for the job.

12:05.054 --> 12:06.421
Ok, cool.

12:06.523 --> 12:08.556
I want Broken Heart Vineyards.

12:08.657 --> 12:11.424
It's vintage, organic,
web presence,

12:11.526 --> 12:13.026
they do everything
back to basics.

12:13.127 --> 12:14.160
And it's trending.

12:14.261 --> 12:15.161
Gonna be hot.

12:15.262 --> 12:17.395
But it's not for sale.

12:17.496 --> 12:21.498
Unlike Kellar Vineyard,
which I highly recommend.

12:21.599 --> 12:23.567
Nancy, you're such a bummer.

12:23.668 --> 12:26.769
Broken Heart was recently
sold to a group in California.

12:26.870 --> 12:29.538
I just don't see them turning
around and selling so quickly.

12:29.639 --> 12:31.172
Ok, so let's offer them double.

12:31.273 --> 12:31.805
Double?

12:31.907 --> 12:32.606
Yeah.

12:32.707 --> 12:34.607
It's all part of the plan, man.

12:34.708 --> 12:35.608
What do you say, Molly?

12:35.709 --> 12:36.808
Make it happen?

12:36.910 --> 12:38.944
I will do my best
to deliver you

12:39.045 --> 12:41.546
Broken Heart Vineyards,
Mr. Slade.

12:41.647 --> 12:44.080
I like her so much better
than you, Nancy.

12:44.182 --> 12:45.115
Oh.

12:46.284 --> 12:47.082
Uh-oh. Time's up.

12:47.184 --> 12:48.918
Time to water the daisies.

12:49.019 --> 12:50.518
Oh, I schedule everything.

12:50.619 --> 12:52.153
Even trips to the washroom.

12:52.254 --> 12:54.755
Allows more time
for true serenity.

12:54.856 --> 12:55.856
It's very odd.

12:55.957 --> 12:56.856
Downer, Nan.

12:56.957 --> 12:57.823
Don't call.

12:57.925 --> 12:58.891
I won't answer.

12:58.992 --> 12:59.958
Ok.

13:00.059 --> 13:02.060
Molly, namaste.

13:04.930 --> 13:06.262
I think he's gone.

13:09.449 --> 13:12.583
Make an appointment with
the curator at Broken Heart.

13:12.684 --> 13:13.651
Her name is Miss Tisher.

13:13.752 --> 13:16.419
Find out who the owners are.

13:16.520 --> 13:19.388
Randall Slade is very good
at wasting money.

13:19.489 --> 13:21.624
You can count on me,
Mrs. Spencer.

13:21.725 --> 13:22.557
Good.

13:22.658 --> 13:26.560
Should I roll him somewhere?

13:26.661 --> 13:27.394
Uh, no.

13:27.495 --> 13:29.595
Someone will pick him up.

13:35.400 --> 13:37.668
Aw, that's sweet.

13:54.147 --> 13:57.148
And there's one more.

13:57.249 --> 14:00.284
This flower-obsessed,
good-looking boyfriend of yours?

14:00.385 --> 14:02.385
Keep him.

14:10.325 --> 14:12.558
The scallops in the sage
butter sauce is amazing.

14:12.660 --> 14:14.226
Another part of their new menu.

14:14.327 --> 14:15.260
I like their old menu.

14:15.361 --> 14:16.361
It was reliable.

14:16.462 --> 14:17.862
Reliable equals boring.

14:17.963 --> 14:19.297
Every six months you gotta
change something.

14:19.398 --> 14:20.563
Greg is reliable.

14:20.665 --> 14:23.266
Every Monday morning at 9:15
there are flowers on my desk.

14:23.367 --> 14:27.335
That's a subscription that
your rebound forgot to cancel.

14:27.436 --> 14:29.904
He's not my rebound.

14:30.005 --> 14:32.306
Two weeks after Jackson you
moved here and meet Greg.

14:32.407 --> 14:34.640
As a lawyer I can tell you
it's an open and shut case.

14:34.741 --> 14:35.908
Oh, come on.

14:36.009 --> 14:37.475
Is flowers all it takes
to get you in bed?

14:37.576 --> 14:38.910
No.

14:39.011 --> 14:42.079
What about...
nice earrings.

14:42.180 --> 14:43.613
Greg got them for me.

14:43.714 --> 14:44.981
They're too flashy,
aren't they?

14:45.082 --> 14:47.182
No, they frame your face nicely.

14:48.217 --> 14:50.151
Ok, very convincing.

14:50.252 --> 14:51.285
Anniversary?

14:51.386 --> 14:53.887
Nope, just Greg being sweet.

14:53.988 --> 14:56.056
There's always a motive.

14:56.156 --> 14:58.324
You really should let me
cross-examine your boyfriends.

14:58.425 --> 15:00.491
And that's why I never
introduced you to Jackson.

15:02.660 --> 15:04.361
Oh!

15:04.462 --> 15:05.095
What are you looking at?

15:05.196 --> 15:06.629
Go get more napkins.

15:06.730 --> 15:07.930
At least it's white wine.

15:08.031 --> 15:09.531
It's still gonna leave a stain.

15:09.632 --> 15:10.832
That's ok.

15:10.933 --> 15:12.967
Go online and check out
"Wine, Women, and Song".

15:13.068 --> 15:14.468
It has the best remedies
on how to get wine

15:14.569 --> 15:15.535
out of your clothes.

15:15.636 --> 15:17.103
But it's white wine.

15:17.204 --> 15:19.004
It's still gonna stain,
look.

15:19.105 --> 15:21.106
"Wine, Women, and Song".

15:21.207 --> 15:23.841
And check out Jean-Luc
Pierre's daily blog on the site.

15:23.942 --> 15:25.375
It's hot.

15:25.476 --> 15:26.476
Never heard of him.

15:26.577 --> 15:29.878
He's this elusive,
sensitive writer from France

15:29.980 --> 15:32.981
who documents his life, love,
music and wine.

15:33.082 --> 15:35.248
The blog is on the ten most
read list.

15:35.350 --> 15:36.850
I'm not really into blogs.

15:36.951 --> 15:38.151
You'll be into this one.

15:38.251 --> 15:41.920
Jean-Luc still yearns for
Carmen, the love of his life.

15:42.021 --> 15:43.855
It's so tragic.

15:43.956 --> 15:46.223
It makes me tear up
just thinking about it.

15:46.324 --> 15:48.858
What is wrong with you?

15:48.959 --> 15:50.126
You have to read it.

15:50.227 --> 15:52.094
Ok.

16:28.387 --> 16:29.854
Ok.

16:29.955 --> 16:32.522
Jean-Luc, not so bad.

16:41.496 --> 16:43.362
<i>Carmen is gone.</i>

16:43.463 --> 16:45.531
<i>I made a fool's mistake.</i>

16:45.632 --> 16:48.333
<i>Love is fragile,</i>

16:48.434 --> 16:52.569
<i>and with my careless actions</i>
<i>I've crushed my Carmen,</i>

16:52.670 --> 16:57.339
<i>my life, my heart.</i>

16:57.440 --> 16:59.440
<i>And now I fear tomorrow.</i>

16:59.541 --> 17:01.542
<i>I fear loneliness.</i>

17:01.643 --> 17:05.512
<i>I fear that love will never</i>
<i>enter my house again.</i>

17:05.613 --> 17:11.082
<i>Fear is all that is left</i>
<i>without Carmen.</i>

17:25.093 --> 17:25.992
<i>Hello.</i>

17:26.093 --> 17:28.960
<i>I was introduced to your</i>
<i>blog today.</i>

17:29.062 --> 17:32.129
<i>Your writing is heartfelt.</i>

17:32.230 --> 17:34.365
<i>Thank you for sharing your</i>
<i>experiences with us.</i>

17:34.466 --> 17:36.966
<i>Molly.</i>

17:45.039 --> 17:47.574
What am I doing?

17:51.210 --> 17:54.311
<i>Molly, it's my pleasure to have</i>
<i>met your acquaintance.</i>

17:54.412 --> 17:57.547
<i>Your kind words will</i>
<i>continue to motivate me.</i>

17:57.648 --> 18:01.516
<i>May I ask why you came</i>
<i>to my site?</i>

18:13.426 --> 18:14.859
Nice vineyard.

18:14.960 --> 18:16.060
It's so close.

18:16.161 --> 18:17.294
Who owns this place?

18:17.395 --> 18:20.063
As far as we can tell, a few
investors from California,

18:20.164 --> 18:22.398
but they're hiding behind
a couple corporations.

18:22.499 --> 18:25.300
I'm hoping Miss Tisher
will have some answers.

18:26.535 --> 18:27.868
They don't want to sell.

18:27.969 --> 18:30.036
I have to convince them.

18:38.343 --> 18:40.443
Well then, I'm going to walk
around and check the place out

18:40.544 --> 18:41.845
while you go and do that.

18:41.946 --> 18:43.545
I'll text you when I'm done.

19:06.395 --> 19:07.329
As soon as you're finished here

19:07.430 --> 19:08.863
I'm pretty sure we've got
another leak

19:08.964 --> 19:10.331
over in the rondos.

19:10.432 --> 19:12.999
Got it.

19:17.003 --> 19:20.838
Well hello to my new boy toy.

19:20.939 --> 19:22.973
Hot day.

19:23.074 --> 19:23.874
Hi there.

19:23.975 --> 19:25.674
Hi.

19:25.775 --> 19:26.442
You shouldn't be out here.

19:26.543 --> 19:27.877
It's off limits to the public.

19:27.978 --> 19:28.676
Hey, let her stay, man.

19:28.777 --> 19:31.412
She's hot.

19:31.513 --> 19:34.181
I'm lost. Can you help me?

19:34.282 --> 19:36.949
Sure. I'm Jackson West.

19:37.050 --> 19:38.316
Jackson West.

19:38.417 --> 19:39.851
I know that name.

19:39.952 --> 19:41.986
And you know a lot
about wine.

19:42.087 --> 19:45.321
Yeah, that's why I work here.

19:45.422 --> 19:47.290
You're the Jackson West.

19:47.391 --> 19:48.023
Do I know you?

19:48.124 --> 19:49.091
No, no.

19:49.192 --> 19:51.759
I've just heard
your name before.

19:51.860 --> 19:53.427
Uh, probably at a wine tasting.

19:53.529 --> 19:57.963
And I'm Romeo, but my
special friends call me Romeo.

19:59.065 --> 20:01.666
Hi, Romeo.

20:01.767 --> 20:05.669
I didn't know we had a tour
today, Romeo.

20:05.770 --> 20:06.837
You don't.

20:06.938 --> 20:09.105
Um, my friend is meeting
with Miss Tisher

20:09.206 --> 20:10.972
about buying the place.

20:11.073 --> 20:12.941
I told you man, not to trust
the old bat.

20:13.042 --> 20:14.975
It's ok.

20:15.076 --> 20:15.943
Your friend is-

20:16.044 --> 20:17.677
Her client is some
rich billionaire

20:17.778 --> 20:19.879
who wants to dabble in wine.

20:19.980 --> 20:22.080
Dabble? In wine?

20:22.182 --> 20:25.249
Well, you know how rich
people are.

20:25.350 --> 20:29.152
Dabbling in... things.

20:29.253 --> 20:31.921
Yes, I'm sure it won't work out.

20:32.022 --> 20:33.321
Look, I should probably
get inside

20:33.422 --> 20:34.322
and find out what's going on.

20:34.423 --> 20:35.390
No!

20:35.491 --> 20:38.358
I mean, I've never been to
a vineyard before

20:38.459 --> 20:41.093
and I would love to look around.

20:41.195 --> 20:43.028
Well, there's not much
to see.

20:43.129 --> 20:44.196
We're in the middle
of our season.

20:44.297 --> 20:47.231
Our harvest isn't until August,
so it's pretty slow.

20:47.332 --> 20:50.867
Slow is exactly what I need.

20:52.269 --> 20:54.203
Ok.

20:54.304 --> 20:55.137
Would you excuse me?

20:55.238 --> 20:57.171
Sure.

21:24.225 --> 21:29.427
Oh, well hello.

21:29.528 --> 21:31.394
Wonderful view, isn't it?

21:31.495 --> 21:32.762
Miss Tisher?

21:32.863 --> 21:34.064
You must be Molly Dawson.

21:34.165 --> 21:35.197
It's a pleasure to meet you.

21:35.298 --> 21:36.098
Come.

21:36.199 --> 21:38.533
Let's discuss this offer
of yours.

21:40.202 --> 21:41.068
How was your drive?

21:41.169 --> 21:43.003
It was beautiful.

21:44.338 --> 21:45.204
So, what's your name?

21:45.305 --> 21:46.405
Liz.

21:46.506 --> 21:48.240
Elizabeth.

21:48.341 --> 21:49.140
Alright, Elizabeth.

21:49.242 --> 21:50.275
I'll take you over here.

21:50.376 --> 21:52.276
We've got a watering system
I need to check on.

21:52.377 --> 21:54.043
Is it close to any wine samples?

21:56.981 --> 21:58.981
I'm sorry, but you've wasted
your time.

21:59.082 --> 22:01.115
The owners will not sell.

22:01.216 --> 22:04.684
Miss Tisher, I represent a
very aggressive buyer

22:04.785 --> 22:10.321
who is willing to give your
owners a more than fair price.

22:10.422 --> 22:12.757
At least take a look
at the offer.

22:17.861 --> 22:21.129
Oh dear.

22:21.230 --> 22:22.163
That's six zeros.

22:22.265 --> 22:23.697
Seven.

22:23.798 --> 22:26.267
Oh dear.

22:26.368 --> 22:28.034
Well, um...

22:28.135 --> 22:32.671
uh, I'll mention this
to the owners.

22:32.772 --> 22:37.240
But even at this price I'm
not sure they'll accept.

22:37.341 --> 22:40.909
We own several trending brands
and trademarks...

22:46.114 --> 22:48.949
Do you need a minute?

22:49.049 --> 22:52.350
No, I'm sorry.

22:52.451 --> 22:54.386
Well, I'll uh...

22:54.487 --> 22:57.821
I'll hang on to this
and um...

22:57.922 --> 23:01.057
I'll see you out.

23:01.158 --> 23:02.924
Great.

23:05.460 --> 23:07.795
Wine has been around
since the start of time.

23:07.896 --> 23:09.829
Plato once said nothing more
valuable than wine

23:09.930 --> 23:12.631
was ever granted
by the gods to men.

23:12.732 --> 23:14.700
Winemaking is an art
just like painting,

23:14.801 --> 23:18.368
only I use sunlight, water,
and love.

23:18.469 --> 23:20.837
Jean-Luc Pierre.

23:20.938 --> 23:23.239
You stole that from Wine, Women,
and Song.

23:23.340 --> 23:24.640
You know Jean-Luc?

23:24.740 --> 23:25.940
He's a nasty habit.

23:26.042 --> 23:29.877
Yesterday's blog on "wine is
best served on a broken heart".

23:29.978 --> 23:31.111
You have experience?

23:32.179 --> 23:33.646
I do the heartbreaking.

23:33.747 --> 23:36.315
"Lethal Liz" they call me.

23:36.416 --> 23:37.382
Hey, Molly!

23:37.483 --> 23:39.083
Where?

23:39.184 --> 23:41.051
Hey! There you are!

23:41.152 --> 23:41.951
Calm down.

23:42.053 --> 23:42.986
Good girl.

23:43.087 --> 23:44.920
You named your dog Molly?

23:45.021 --> 23:45.754
Molly's a pup, really.

23:45.889 --> 23:47.189
I've only had her
about a year.

23:47.290 --> 23:48.923
Here, go fetch!

23:49.024 --> 23:50.024
How's the tour going?

23:50.125 --> 23:51.858
Are we ready for
the Romeo special?

23:51.959 --> 23:53.026
No.

23:53.127 --> 23:55.027
Look, I'm really sorry but
we have to get into town

23:55.128 --> 23:56.896
to get some supplies, don't we?

23:56.997 --> 23:57.962
It's been really good
to meet you.

23:58.064 --> 23:59.698
You can find your way out
through there.

23:59.799 --> 24:01.131
Yeah, sure.

24:01.232 --> 24:03.167
Ok.

24:03.268 --> 24:05.335
Lady, you forgot your bag.

24:06.737 --> 24:08.036
Ooh!

24:09.372 --> 24:10.171
We're gonna get sued,
amigo!

24:10.272 --> 24:11.672
Shut up, Romeo!

24:11.773 --> 24:12.139
Elizabeth?

24:12.274 --> 24:13.606
Molly, get!

24:13.708 --> 24:14.774
Molly, get out of the way!

24:14.875 --> 24:16.076
Molly, get out of the way!

24:16.177 --> 24:17.209
Backpacks are ready to go,

24:17.310 --> 24:19.745
and it's only sixteen hours
to the border.

24:19.845 --> 24:21.612
They have vineyards in Mexico!

24:21.714 --> 24:22.146
No, no.

24:22.281 --> 24:23.747
I'm ok, I'm ok.

24:23.848 --> 24:24.314
Really.

24:24.415 --> 24:25.148
Are you sure?

24:25.249 --> 24:26.282
Yes.

24:26.383 --> 24:27.917
You took a pretty nasty
spill there.

24:28.018 --> 24:29.285
Yes, I'm fine.

24:29.386 --> 24:30.719
I think I can stand.

24:30.820 --> 24:31.853
Liz?

24:31.954 --> 24:32.920
We're dead, amigo.

24:33.021 --> 24:33.687
Oh my gosh, Liz.

24:33.788 --> 24:34.321
Are you ok?

24:34.422 --> 24:35.155
I'm ok.

24:35.256 --> 24:36.055
Molly, quiet!

24:36.156 --> 24:37.757
Excuse me?

24:40.793 --> 24:43.894
Oh, this is awkward.

24:43.995 --> 24:44.729
Jackson?

24:44.830 --> 24:45.929
Molly?

24:48.132 --> 24:50.265
Back away slowly.

25:00.307 --> 25:02.607
Some tequila, to help
with the pain.

25:02.708 --> 25:03.641
Is it top shelf?

25:03.743 --> 25:05.776
Only shelf.

25:08.379 --> 25:11.247
Ay ay ay, that's not looking
so good.

25:12.315 --> 25:17.051
It's an old relationship
with a lot of baggage.

25:17.152 --> 25:18.284
How passionate.

25:18.386 --> 25:20.153
Just like a telenovela.

25:20.254 --> 25:21.920
In this entire state,
how big is it,

25:22.021 --> 25:23.155
and you come to this winery?

25:23.256 --> 25:23.956
Oh, come on.

25:24.057 --> 25:24.756
You knew I worked here.

25:24.857 --> 25:25.690
No, I didn't.

25:25.791 --> 25:26.758
You knew I worked here,
just admit it.

25:26.859 --> 25:27.091
I didn't.

25:27.192 --> 25:27.759
No-

25:27.859 --> 25:28.258
You knew I worked here.

25:28.359 --> 25:28.759
I didn't know-

25:28.860 --> 25:29.259
Say it.

25:29.360 --> 25:29.993
No, I did not-

25:30.094 --> 25:31.127
You knew I worked here.

25:31.261 --> 25:33.662
No, I have a client
who wants to buy the place.

25:33.764 --> 25:34.863
Over my cold dead body.

25:34.964 --> 25:36.631
That's an appealing proposition.

25:36.732 --> 25:38.132
Especially since Miss Tisher
is taking the offer

25:38.233 --> 25:39.800
to the investment
group tomorrow.

25:39.901 --> 25:40.334
Investment group?

25:40.435 --> 25:41.300
Mmmhmm.

25:41.402 --> 25:43.770
Hey, you never gave me
a chance.

25:43.871 --> 25:45.003
You cheated on me!

25:45.104 --> 25:46.838
Come on, we had gone on two
dates when that happened!

25:46.939 --> 25:47.838
I made a mistake, yes.

25:47.939 --> 25:49.240
But cheating? Hardly.

25:49.341 --> 25:50.007
Where's the kid?

25:50.108 --> 25:50.807
Hah!

25:50.908 --> 25:52.041
Ok, you want to know something?

25:52.143 --> 25:54.276
She was right, Kyle is mine
and Vanessa

25:54.377 --> 25:57.245
took advantage of my good nature
so you know what I did?

25:57.346 --> 25:59.046
I fought for custody.

25:59.148 --> 26:00.114
And lost.

26:00.214 --> 26:04.049
She took him from me
and moved back to Texas.

26:04.151 --> 26:05.217
I'm sorry.

26:05.318 --> 26:07.018
That sounds terrible.

26:07.119 --> 26:08.253
Yeah.

26:08.354 --> 26:10.921
But what about the emails
and the phone calls?

26:11.022 --> 26:12.956
You still moved here
to stalk me.

26:13.057 --> 26:14.056
Stalking?!

26:14.158 --> 26:15.291
Who found whom?

26:15.392 --> 26:17.592
Two months you called my phone
every night!

26:17.693 --> 26:20.060
And on top of that, you named
your dog Molly?

26:20.162 --> 26:22.862
Only a stalker would name
his dog after his ex-girlfriend!

26:22.963 --> 26:23.797
Hah!

26:23.898 --> 26:25.799
Ok, it's not exactly your
name, ok?

26:25.900 --> 26:29.134
It's only Molly with one...
"L".

26:29.235 --> 26:30.535
Moly.

26:30.636 --> 26:31.068
<i>Jackson?</i>

26:31.170 --> 26:32.069
Yes.

26:32.171 --> 26:33.003
<i>May I have a word with you?</i>

26:33.104 --> 26:34.738
Sure.

26:42.410 --> 26:43.243
You need to look at this.

26:43.344 --> 26:44.111
What is it?

26:44.212 --> 26:45.812
Their offer.

26:45.913 --> 26:46.612
The answer is no.

26:46.713 --> 26:48.181
Just look.

26:55.786 --> 26:56.586
Six?

26:56.687 --> 26:57.554
Seven zeros.

26:57.655 --> 26:59.254
Ah, yes. Why?

26:59.355 --> 27:00.823
I don't have a clue.

27:00.924 --> 27:03.658
But that offer is nearly
two times the market value

27:03.759 --> 27:05.592
of the vineyard when
you bought it.

27:05.693 --> 27:07.994
I appreciate what you've done,
trying to save my life's work,

27:08.095 --> 27:10.896
but that offer is enough to
pay off the bank loans.

27:10.997 --> 27:12.664
You can go to France.

27:12.765 --> 27:15.866
Start over with some really
good land.

27:15.967 --> 27:17.167
And me?

27:17.268 --> 27:20.169
I'm staring at retirement.

27:20.270 --> 27:23.605
She's asked for full disclosure
as to who the owners are.

27:23.706 --> 27:25.706
What would you like to do?

27:44.220 --> 27:45.954
The owners want a full
accounting of all assets

27:46.055 --> 27:47.988
before they consider your offer.

27:48.089 --> 27:48.889
That's nice.

27:48.990 --> 27:50.590
You're telling me this why?

27:50.691 --> 27:52.124
Well, if my people do it
that might take

27:52.226 --> 27:53.925
three or four months.

27:54.026 --> 27:55.794
We're not fully staffed
right now.

27:55.895 --> 27:57.795
I don't have the time.

27:57.896 --> 28:00.063
Well, then no deal.

28:00.164 --> 28:00.930
Sorry.

28:01.031 --> 28:03.632
Ok, fine. I will find someone.

28:03.733 --> 28:05.234
I don't know.

28:05.335 --> 28:09.637
They're really picky about
who has access to these areas.

28:09.738 --> 28:11.605
You'll have to do it yourself.

28:11.706 --> 28:13.072
You're kidding.

28:13.173 --> 28:16.141
I mean, I'll be here to help.

28:16.242 --> 28:17.509
You know I've moved on.

28:17.610 --> 28:18.042
Didn't ask.

28:18.143 --> 28:18.843
His name is Greg.

28:18.944 --> 28:19.977
Don't care.

28:20.078 --> 28:22.012
And I want no misconceptions
about my intentions.

28:22.113 --> 28:23.212
Hey, look.

28:23.313 --> 28:25.781
If your client buys this
place I could be out of a job.

28:25.883 --> 28:29.950
So don't expect me to be happy
about this.

28:30.051 --> 28:30.751
What about you?

28:30.852 --> 28:31.519
What about me?

28:31.620 --> 28:34.521
Surely you've moved on, dated.

28:34.622 --> 28:36.588
Oh, yeah.

28:36.689 --> 28:37.589
For sure.

28:37.690 --> 28:42.626
I met-found a woman.

28:42.727 --> 28:44.060
She's great.

28:44.161 --> 28:44.895
Really?

28:44.996 --> 28:45.995
Yes.

28:46.096 --> 28:47.663
What's her name?

28:52.800 --> 28:55.968
Raphael... ee.

28:56.069 --> 28:58.837
Rafaelie.

28:58.938 --> 29:00.272
Rafaelie.

29:00.373 --> 29:03.073
That's a manly name.

29:03.174 --> 29:05.775
Named after her Italian father.

29:05.876 --> 29:07.710
Well, you clearly haven't lost

29:07.811 --> 29:10.178
your kind and unselfish
disposition.

29:10.280 --> 29:11.812
We can be friends.

29:11.914 --> 29:12.647
Not possible.

29:12.748 --> 29:13.681
What?

29:13.782 --> 29:15.849
Impossible to be friends
after a break-up.

29:15.950 --> 29:16.816
You said it yourself.

29:16.918 --> 29:18.150
Ok, fine.

29:18.251 --> 29:19.818
Business associates.

29:19.920 --> 29:21.619
Fine.

29:21.720 --> 29:23.054
I'll see you tomorrow.

29:23.155 --> 29:25.055
Good.

29:35.997 --> 29:39.065
At first I thought he was
this hot, naked farmer guy,

29:39.166 --> 29:41.166
and then I figured it out.

29:41.267 --> 29:43.068
And then I tried
to keep him occupied.

29:43.169 --> 29:45.603
I know you did.

29:45.704 --> 29:47.671
Did this whole past thing
blow your deal?

29:47.772 --> 29:49.005
Is everything ok?

29:49.106 --> 29:50.040
Everything's fine.

29:50.141 --> 29:51.707
Besides, I'm more worried about
you right now.

29:52.809 --> 29:54.142
I have never been better.

29:54.243 --> 29:55.009
Please, let me help.

29:55.110 --> 29:57.811
Romeo!

29:57.912 --> 29:58.745
There you go.

29:58.846 --> 30:03.248
That tequila? Top shelf.

30:03.349 --> 30:04.583
I can get some more.

30:04.684 --> 30:06.184
Maybe bring it to your place-

30:09.287 --> 30:10.987
Call me.

30:14.924 --> 30:16.824
Ole!

30:16.925 --> 30:19.293
Hey Molly?

30:19.393 --> 30:20.360
Yeah?

30:24.831 --> 30:27.699
That's destiny.

30:30.902 --> 30:33.102
Yeah.

30:53.250 --> 30:54.084
Yeah!

30:54.185 --> 30:55.884
Yeah! Shoot!

30:55.986 --> 30:56.986
Yeah!

30:57.087 --> 30:57.987
No! Come on!

30:58.088 --> 30:59.954
What are you doing,
De La Goa?

31:00.055 --> 31:03.323
Boo!

31:03.424 --> 31:04.257
Can you believe that?

31:04.359 --> 31:06.025
He had the shot
and didn't take it.

31:06.126 --> 31:08.126
What a jerk.

31:08.227 --> 31:09.928
Molly?

31:10.029 --> 31:12.696
Molly?

31:12.797 --> 31:13.697
Yeah?

31:13.798 --> 31:15.231
You ok?

31:15.332 --> 31:16.165
I'm good.

31:16.266 --> 31:17.233
Remind me to pick you up
some Ritalin.

31:17.334 --> 31:19.034
Help you focus.

31:19.135 --> 31:20.702
Hey Rick.

31:20.803 --> 31:22.670
Here's your beer.

31:22.771 --> 31:23.838
Thanks, buddy.

31:23.939 --> 31:24.904
What'd I miss?

31:25.006 --> 31:26.773
De La Goa totally blew this
wide open shot.

31:26.874 --> 31:27.673
No way.

31:27.774 --> 31:29.141
Way.

31:29.242 --> 31:33.944
BTW, Jerry's new assistant is an
eleven on the Richter scale.

31:34.045 --> 31:34.911
Not possible.

31:35.013 --> 31:36.013
How old?

31:36.114 --> 31:37.747
You think I checked her ID?

31:37.848 --> 31:38.881
Twenty-one.

31:38.982 --> 31:39.682
Black Jack.

31:39.783 --> 31:40.815
I gotta meet her.

31:40.916 --> 31:42.050
Come by the office tomorrow
and I'll intro you.

31:42.151 --> 31:42.984
Sounds good.

31:43.085 --> 31:43.984
Hey, um... Greg?

31:44.085 --> 31:45.085
Hey, um, Mol?

31:45.186 --> 31:46.520
Honey bunny?

31:46.621 --> 31:48.688
I'm going to head home
and finish some work.

31:48.789 --> 31:50.555
I've got another busy
day tomorrow.

31:50.657 --> 31:52.224
Ok, sure.

31:56.661 --> 32:00.062
Hey, I uh... got what you
asked for.

32:00.163 --> 32:04.932
Just in time for a Valentine's
Day proposal.

32:05.034 --> 32:07.100
Yeah, brother!

32:07.201 --> 32:08.468
How much?

32:08.569 --> 32:10.803
First, I gotta tell ya,

32:10.904 --> 32:14.506
it's been making serious rounds
with the guys.

32:14.607 --> 32:16.173
Bill sold it to Shane

32:16.274 --> 32:19.109
because of the whole stripper
incident, who sold it to Nick,

32:19.209 --> 32:21.811
but he got divorced because of
the office party,

32:21.912 --> 32:24.079
and then Bob bought it
but he found out

32:24.180 --> 32:28.616
his girlfriend was sleeping
with Bill.

32:30.217 --> 32:33.819
They all think the ring
is cursed.

32:35.288 --> 32:35.953
How much?

32:36.055 --> 32:36.754
$300

32:36.855 --> 32:37.588
Awesome.

32:37.690 --> 32:39.523
What are friends for?

32:39.624 --> 32:40.524
Yeah! Shoot!

32:40.625 --> 32:41.525
Goal! Yes!

32:41.626 --> 32:42.124
Score!

32:44.795 --> 32:46.061
Hey, two shots of whiskey!

32:46.162 --> 32:47.595
Doubles.

32:47.697 --> 32:48.063
Ok.

32:49.931 --> 32:52.732
$20, I get her number.

32:56.102 --> 32:57.502
What've you got there?

32:57.603 --> 33:00.037
555-2982.

33:00.138 --> 33:03.339
You sly dog.

33:11.846 --> 33:13.680
That Molly really did
a number two on you.

33:13.781 --> 33:15.581
And I'm not talking
about the perro.

33:15.682 --> 33:17.515
The one that got away.

33:17.616 --> 33:18.149
You want to talk about it?

33:18.250 --> 33:19.184
No.

33:19.285 --> 33:20.085
Ok.

33:20.186 --> 33:21.452
The burgers are almost done.

33:21.553 --> 33:22.753
You know what really gets me
though?

33:22.854 --> 33:24.887
We had something.

33:24.988 --> 33:26.789
We had something real.

33:26.890 --> 33:29.124
And as much as I've tried
to ignore it,

33:29.225 --> 33:32.727
I'm always going back
to thinking about her.

33:32.828 --> 33:34.527
Molly was right, you know?

33:34.628 --> 33:39.465
I came to New Mexico
looking for her.

33:39.566 --> 33:42.567
I stood outside her apartment
for an hour

33:42.668 --> 33:44.768
and I still couldn't
bring myself to knock.

33:44.869 --> 33:46.002
You should see a doctor.

33:46.104 --> 33:48.738
I'm broken-hearted,
not crazy.

33:48.839 --> 33:50.705
Ok, so you really want this
girl back?

33:50.806 --> 33:52.841
More than anything,
but she has a boyfriend

33:52.942 --> 33:58.511
and she hates me, and she kinda
thinks I have a girlfriend.

33:58.612 --> 33:59.178
Oooh.

33:59.279 --> 34:00.078
Rafaelie.

34:00.179 --> 34:00.779
Oooh.

34:00.880 --> 34:01.646
Yeah.

34:01.748 --> 34:03.114
That's a dude's name.

34:03.215 --> 34:03.848
Yeah.

34:08.219 --> 34:09.585
It's her.

34:09.686 --> 34:10.753
Molly or Rafaelie?

34:10.853 --> 34:12.652
If it's Molly, don't answer.

34:12.755 --> 34:13.487
Que te dije?

34:13.589 --> 34:14.489
Hi.

34:14.590 --> 34:15.523
I'm going through your
yield reports

34:15.623 --> 34:16.956
and I have some questions.

34:17.058 --> 34:17.824
Don't give in to her.

34:17.925 --> 34:18.558
Take charge.

34:18.659 --> 34:19.492
You are the man.

34:19.592 --> 34:20.926
What kind of questions?

34:21.027 --> 34:21.927
Ow!

34:22.027 --> 34:22.860
<i>Are you ok?</i>

34:22.962 --> 34:23.895
Fine, fine.

34:23.996 --> 34:25.463
Is someone there with you?

34:25.563 --> 34:27.764
Romeo, and he's just leaving.

34:27.866 --> 34:29.431
Come on!

34:29.533 --> 34:30.199
<i>Jackson?</i>

34:30.300 --> 34:31.134
Rafaelie!

34:31.235 --> 34:32.434
No, get away!

34:32.534 --> 34:33.101
You want this girl back?

34:33.202 --> 34:33.869
You listen to me!

34:33.969 --> 34:35.536
Get back!

34:36.304 --> 34:37.338
Jackson?

34:37.438 --> 34:38.472
Papi, are you there?

34:38.572 --> 34:39.105
Who's that?

34:39.206 --> 34:40.139
Is it Rafaelie?

34:40.241 --> 34:42.474
Um...

34:42.574 --> 34:45.543
Papi, the burgers are
almost done.

34:45.643 --> 34:46.577
She sounds Spanish.

34:46.678 --> 34:48.045
I thought she was Italian.

34:48.147 --> 34:50.045
Um, Italian on her
father's side.

34:50.148 --> 34:51.746
Her mother is Spanish.

34:51.848 --> 34:54.150
Papi, who are you talking to?

34:54.251 --> 34:56.451
That better not be another
woman.

34:56.552 --> 34:59.520
My latin blood just drives me
to kill.

35:03.791 --> 35:05.590
Molly, I'll have to call you
back.

35:07.193 --> 35:09.026
Perfect.

35:12.029 --> 35:13.096
Oh, papi, you're the best.

35:13.197 --> 35:15.697
You're the best.

35:15.799 --> 35:17.498
She hung up.

35:19.802 --> 35:21.735
And if anybody ever finds out
about this,

35:21.836 --> 35:23.770
I will bury you
with the grape grinds.

35:23.870 --> 35:25.738
I did you a favour.

35:25.839 --> 35:27.705
You really want Molly back
in your arms?

35:27.807 --> 35:29.774
You gotta listen to
the Latin lover.

35:29.875 --> 35:31.441
And I suppose that's you?

35:31.543 --> 35:32.709
I'm undefeated.

35:32.811 --> 35:35.411
I even found my third uncle
a wife and she's blind.

35:35.512 --> 35:38.280
I'm a pro with the ladies.

35:40.248 --> 35:43.150
Tomorrow at your meeting,
when her man is texting her,

35:43.251 --> 35:45.752
what are you going to do?

35:45.853 --> 35:47.052
Sit there, watch her laugh,

35:47.153 --> 35:48.887
and feel sorry for yourself?

35:48.988 --> 35:51.789
Self pity no es buena,
my friend.

35:51.890 --> 35:53.723
This is what you're going
to do.

35:53.825 --> 35:56.159
You get mujer caliente
to text you, too,

35:56.259 --> 35:58.194
and then Molly starts to think

35:58.295 --> 36:01.162
that maybe she let someone
worth while go.

36:01.263 --> 36:03.831
Women are covetous creatures,
my friend.

36:03.932 --> 36:05.833
Play the game and
you will get Molly back.

36:05.934 --> 36:06.999
You're forgetting one thing.

36:07.100 --> 36:08.734
Rafaelie doesn't exist.

36:08.836 --> 36:10.769
Si, amigo. She does.

36:15.173 --> 36:17.207
Virtual girlfriend?

36:18.642 --> 36:19.408
No.

36:19.509 --> 36:20.542
It works, I promise!

36:20.643 --> 36:22.077
Give me your phone.

36:22.177 --> 36:22.944
Hey, give that back.

36:23.045 --> 36:23.845
You really want Molly back?

36:23.946 --> 36:24.879
Yes.

36:24.980 --> 36:27.013
Then let the Latin lover guide
the way.

36:27.114 --> 36:28.781
This is gonna end badly.

36:28.882 --> 36:30.683
What could go wrong?

36:30.784 --> 36:32.784
The burgers!

36:39.773 --> 36:44.576
<i> With love there</i>
<i>is no certainty.</i>

36:44.677 --> 36:46.176
<i>Is a flower in bloom</i>

36:46.278 --> 36:50.747
<i>not yet a flower unless</i>
<i>it is spring?</i>

36:50.848 --> 36:53.081
<i>I have pondered this as</i>
<i>the seasons change</i>

36:53.182 --> 36:57.451
<i>and grapes wither on the vine.</i>

36:57.553 --> 37:01.086
<i>If I were to see Carmen again,</i>

37:01.187 --> 37:06.758
<i>what would I say?</i>

37:06.859 --> 37:09.593
<i>Tomorrow the wind blows.</i>

37:09.694 --> 37:13.396
<i>Tomorrow the soil gives life.</i>

37:13.497 --> 37:18.232
<i>Tomorrow I may see her.</i>

37:18.333 --> 37:22.468
<i>Perhaps my words</i>
<i>will win her heart.</i>

37:26.739 --> 37:30.407
<i>Molly, how are you this evening?</i>

37:35.211 --> 37:36.645
<i>In turmoil.</i>

37:36.745 --> 37:41.014
<i>I saw an old friend.</i>

37:41.115 --> 37:45.251
<i>Would you like to talk</i>
<i>about it?</i>

37:45.352 --> 37:47.485
<i>There's not much to say.</i>

37:47.587 --> 37:50.020
<i>He broke my heart.</i>

37:50.121 --> 37:55.625
<i>Could you find it somewhere</i>
<i>in your heart to forgive him?</i>

37:58.761 --> 38:01.462
<i>I don't know.</i>

38:18.742 --> 38:19.641
Hey.

38:19.742 --> 38:21.009
Sorry.

38:21.110 --> 38:22.710
You're fifteen minutes late.

38:22.811 --> 38:24.044
Did you get caught in traffic?

38:24.145 --> 38:25.079
I should have said something.

38:25.180 --> 38:27.413
I teach at the cultural centre.

38:27.514 --> 38:28.381
Teacher?

38:28.482 --> 38:29.615
Yeah, uh... three days a week.

38:29.749 --> 38:34.151
Hey, um, a couple months
after you left I sold everything

38:34.252 --> 38:38.088
and I made a few investments
and I should-

38:38.189 --> 38:40.623
We have a lot to do.

38:40.724 --> 38:42.323
I have some paperwork that
I need you to look over

38:42.424 --> 38:44.025
and help me with.

38:44.126 --> 38:45.158
Special delivery.

38:45.293 --> 38:47.160
Oh, you can put those in my car,
I don't want them.

38:47.261 --> 38:48.194
They're not for you.

38:48.295 --> 38:49.228
They're for him.

38:49.329 --> 38:49.962
Me?

38:50.063 --> 38:50.630
Yes.

38:50.731 --> 38:53.098
From Rafaelie.

38:53.199 --> 38:58.635
She's gone out of town,
back to Spain.

38:58.736 --> 39:00.570
Do you need anything?

39:00.671 --> 39:01.737
I'm ok.

39:01.838 --> 39:03.639
Ok.

39:11.778 --> 39:14.112
Like I was saying,

39:14.213 --> 39:17.547
your last yield doesn't match
what you had forecasted.

39:17.649 --> 39:19.049
The champagne grapes
are one example.

39:19.150 --> 39:22.284
Can you hold on?

39:22.386 --> 39:23.519
Hello?

39:23.619 --> 39:27.087
<i>It's a call from Rafaelie.</i>

39:27.188 --> 39:33.126
<i>I want to tell you how much</i>
<i>I love and miss you.</i>

39:33.227 --> 39:35.093
I miss you, too.

39:35.194 --> 39:37.028
<i>I miss you so much.</i>

39:37.129 --> 39:39.530
<i>Your voice makes my</i>
<i>toes tingle.</i>

39:39.631 --> 39:41.064
I can't talk right now.

39:41.165 --> 39:42.966
<i>When will you be home?</i>

39:43.066 --> 39:43.699
I don't know.

39:43.800 --> 39:45.367
<i>When will you be home?</i>

39:45.468 --> 39:46.367
<i>When will you be h-</i>

39:46.468 --> 39:47.168
Ok, I'm in a meeting.

39:47.269 --> 39:48.469
I'll call you later, ok?

39:48.570 --> 39:49.503
Bye.

39:49.604 --> 39:52.639
<i>My loins yearn for-</i>

39:52.739 --> 39:55.241
She's nervous.

39:55.342 --> 39:57.042
Hasn't seen her father
in years.

39:57.143 --> 39:58.943
I'm sorry, where were we?

39:59.045 --> 39:59.643
White wine.

39:59.744 --> 40:01.412
Ah, yes.

40:06.416 --> 40:07.949
Ok.

40:08.051 --> 40:12.952
And... now I'm good.

40:18.058 --> 40:19.624
Greg?

40:19.725 --> 40:20.858
Hey, baby.

40:20.959 --> 40:23.093
I ordered your crew lunch,
should be there around noon.

40:23.194 --> 40:26.028
Oh, sweetie, you didn't have
to do that.

40:26.129 --> 40:27.663
<i>Anything for you,</i>
<i>honey bunny.</i>

40:27.764 --> 40:30.398
Hey, I was also thinking
that we should throw a party

40:30.499 --> 40:31.533
for Valentine's.

40:31.633 --> 40:32.700
That sounds fun.

40:34.269 --> 40:35.334
<i>I know Sunday is</i>
<i>technically Valentine's,</i>

40:35.436 --> 40:36.736
but I had this crazy idea
that we could ring it in

40:36.837 --> 40:39.371
like New Year's
on Saturday night.

40:39.472 --> 40:40.372
What do you think?

40:40.473 --> 40:42.707
<i>I think that is a</i>
<i>wonderful idea.</i>

40:42.808 --> 40:44.341
<i>Let's do it.</i>

40:44.443 --> 40:46.609
Great! Invite all your friends.

40:46.711 --> 40:49.044
<i>Ok, I will-just send me all</i>
<i>the information</i>

40:49.145 --> 40:51.013
<i>and I will pass it along.</i>

40:51.113 --> 40:53.314
Oh, and thank you so much
for all of the flowers.

40:54.716 --> 40:55.449
Righteous.

40:55.583 --> 40:57.217
Much love to you,
honey bunny.

40:57.318 --> 41:00.286
<i>Ok, you too.</i>

41:08.092 --> 41:09.325
Ok, can we get back to work?

41:09.426 --> 41:11.159
Hold on.

41:13.062 --> 41:14.495
Yes.

41:14.596 --> 41:17.030
Hold on.

41:17.131 --> 41:18.498
Ok. Yes.

41:20.101 --> 41:21.033
That's funny stuff.

41:21.134 --> 41:22.067
So, uh, the champagne
grapes.

41:22.168 --> 41:23.235
Right.

41:23.336 --> 41:27.070
Now, if you want to take a look
at this over here...

41:27.171 --> 41:31.407
Yeah, he wants to ring in
Valentine's Day like New Year's.

41:31.508 --> 41:33.975
It'll be romantic.

41:35.411 --> 41:37.144
That's what he said.

41:37.245 --> 41:39.379
Hold on, I've got another
call coming in.

41:39.481 --> 41:42.415
It's Greg. I'll call you back.

41:42.516 --> 41:44.249
Hey.

41:44.350 --> 41:46.117
Excellent, I will meet you
by the back gate.

41:46.218 --> 41:47.785
Ok.

41:50.221 --> 41:52.155
He bought us all lunch.

41:52.256 --> 41:53.155
Who does that?

41:53.256 --> 41:54.056
Don't worry about it.

41:54.157 --> 41:55.624
It's probably a couple
of pizzas.

41:55.725 --> 41:58.126
Delicious, delicious pizzas.

42:04.131 --> 42:06.431
Greg, this is amazing!

42:06.532 --> 42:08.066
Well, you are what you eat

42:08.167 --> 42:10.501
and you look like you at a
snuggle muffin this morning.

42:10.602 --> 42:13.402
Oh, you're so sweet.

42:13.504 --> 42:15.904
Oh, Jackson, this is Greg.

42:16.005 --> 42:16.505
Thanks for lunch.

42:16.606 --> 42:17.939
My pleasure.

42:18.040 --> 42:21.242
So you're the guy
who squeezes grapes.

42:21.343 --> 42:25.377
Yeah, if you mean make
the wine I... I oversee that.

42:25.478 --> 42:26.311
Sorry, what do you do?

42:26.412 --> 42:28.713
Greg is a stockbroker.

42:31.316 --> 42:32.449
How many Mexican stockbrokers

42:32.550 --> 42:33.583
does it take to screw
in a lightbulb?

42:33.684 --> 42:34.417
Romeo.

42:34.519 --> 42:35.217
Just Juan.

42:35.318 --> 42:39.454
Juan's the name
of my brother.

42:39.555 --> 42:41.122
I love stockbroking.

42:41.222 --> 42:42.990
Easy hours, good money.

42:43.091 --> 42:44.657
Gives me more time
to spoil Molly.

42:44.758 --> 42:47.493
Well, she certainly
seems spoiled.

42:47.594 --> 42:49.661
Not too spoiled.

42:51.396 --> 42:53.097
I do have a meeting, though.

42:53.198 --> 42:54.497
You just got here.

42:54.598 --> 42:56.399
Can't you at least eat with us?

42:56.500 --> 43:00.068
A few minutes with you is
all the nourishment I need.

43:02.437 --> 43:03.371
Be strong, my friend.

43:03.472 --> 43:04.704
I'm trying.

43:04.806 --> 43:06.072
Nice meeting you, Jack.

43:06.174 --> 43:07.740
Enjoy your lunch.

43:09.376 --> 43:11.509
Love you, honey bunny.

43:13.012 --> 43:15.012
Companeros, almuerzo.

43:16.347 --> 43:20.115
This is a gift from
my boyfriend, Greg.

43:20.216 --> 43:23.417
These specially prepared dishes
are all organic and vegetarian

43:23.518 --> 43:26.187
and they will make you feel
very healthy.

43:26.288 --> 43:28.254
Please, enjoy.

43:31.424 --> 43:33.424
Let me translate.

43:55.474 --> 43:56.941
Why is no one eating?

43:57.042 --> 43:58.309
It must have been
something you said.

44:02.545 --> 44:05.980
Rafaelie?

44:06.081 --> 44:08.149
How did you guess?

44:20.141 --> 44:25.310
So, how long have you
and Greg been dating?

44:25.411 --> 44:28.312
Greg and I have been together
for almost a year.

44:28.413 --> 44:30.347
I've been studying the typical
layout of a vineyard

44:30.448 --> 44:31.614
and yours is atypical.

44:31.715 --> 44:32.615
I know.

44:32.750 --> 44:34.217
I move things around
so it's more efficient

44:34.318 --> 44:35.584
for hand-picking grapes.

44:35.685 --> 44:36.652
Isn't that slow?

44:36.753 --> 44:37.919
Not the way I do it.

44:38.020 --> 44:41.521
And my way costs less
than conventional methods.

44:44.991 --> 44:46.358
Do you hear that?

44:46.459 --> 44:47.892
Yeah.

45:01.303 --> 45:03.937
I'm guessing Ralph
is short for...

45:04.038 --> 45:05.204
Yes.

45:05.306 --> 45:08.040
Can you excuse me
for a minute?

45:23.384 --> 45:25.552
Romeo! Romeo!

45:25.653 --> 45:28.187
It's ok, you don't need to
follow me anymore.

45:28.288 --> 45:29.322
It's ok, thank you.

45:29.423 --> 45:30.388
Amigo, how's it going?

45:30.489 --> 45:32.257
Tell them to stop, please.

45:40.296 --> 45:41.597
You ordered me a mariachi band?

45:41.698 --> 45:42.431
Seriously?

45:42.532 --> 45:43.998
Her man looked like Thor.

45:44.099 --> 45:45.366
I needed bigger guns.

45:48.402 --> 45:49.068
What?

45:49.169 --> 45:50.436
One hundred text messages?

45:50.537 --> 45:52.004
Between you and
this virtual girlfriend

45:52.105 --> 45:53.137
it's all driving me nuts!

45:53.238 --> 45:54.439
I can't take it anymore.

45:54.540 --> 45:55.973
Jackson, calm down.

45:56.074 --> 45:58.008
Calm down.

45:58.109 --> 46:00.209
Maybe you should plan a vacation
with Rafaelie.

46:00.310 --> 46:01.877
She's not real!

46:01.979 --> 46:03.445
I know that!

46:03.546 --> 46:05.412
I was kidding about
the vacation.

46:05.513 --> 46:08.514
But I wasn't kidding about you
needing to be more sensitive.

46:08.616 --> 46:09.816
More sensitive?

46:09.917 --> 46:11.084
Around Molly.

46:11.185 --> 46:12.951
Treat Rafaelie
with sensitivity.

46:13.052 --> 46:14.353
Listen to her feelings.

46:14.454 --> 46:17.188
Like your favorite
Neil Diamond song.

46:24.527 --> 46:25.159
Forget it.

46:25.260 --> 46:25.927
No more.

46:26.028 --> 46:26.527
But it's working.

46:26.629 --> 46:27.362
You can't quit now.

46:27.463 --> 46:28.295
Working?

46:28.396 --> 46:30.964
She thinks I'm dating
a crazy person!

46:31.065 --> 46:32.264
Tomorrow is phase two.

46:32.366 --> 46:35.467
She falls in love again,
I promise.

46:38.603 --> 46:39.069
Fine.

46:39.204 --> 46:40.037
But no more bands!

46:40.138 --> 46:40.937
I promise nothing.

46:41.038 --> 46:43.039
No more.

46:43.140 --> 46:44.107
Ah!

46:46.142 --> 46:47.541
No more.

46:51.412 --> 46:53.413
It'll be fun.

46:53.514 --> 46:57.982
Ringing in Valentine's Day
like New Year's?

46:58.083 --> 46:59.851
The boy's lost his mind.

46:59.952 --> 47:03.619
Ok, I admit, I would rather
spend some alone time with him.

47:03.720 --> 47:07.288
Good luck breaking Greg away
from the Rickster.

47:08.491 --> 47:10.357
Hey, look at this.

47:10.458 --> 47:12.292
What are you doing on
Jackson's page?

47:12.394 --> 47:13.227
I'm checking him out.

47:13.327 --> 47:14.327
Is that his girlfriend?

47:14.428 --> 47:16.229
Ok, no checking him out.

47:16.330 --> 47:18.030
He's off limits.

47:18.131 --> 47:22.366
Besides, his girlfriend
rivals Greg with the gifts.

47:22.467 --> 47:23.800
Off limits, huh?

47:23.901 --> 47:25.969
Does that mean the old flame
has a little flicker?

47:26.070 --> 47:27.369
There's no flickering.

47:27.470 --> 47:28.937
Does Greg know?

47:29.039 --> 47:29.871
Know what?

47:29.972 --> 47:32.073
About the sordid history?

47:32.174 --> 47:34.141
I am telling Greg nothing.

47:34.242 --> 47:35.409
Men get so paranoid.

47:35.510 --> 47:37.543
Why can't a woman work
with her ex

47:37.644 --> 47:41.046
and feel absolutely nothing but
pride in her professionalism?

47:41.147 --> 47:43.914
Because you still feel
something.

47:44.015 --> 47:46.482
Ok, let's rewind.

47:46.583 --> 47:52.054
Maybe... I admit, maybe
sometimes I feel a little,

47:52.155 --> 47:54.889
tiny, almost microscopic spark,

47:54.990 --> 47:57.290
but that's totally normal for
two people who have a past.

47:57.391 --> 47:58.525
I knew it.

47:58.626 --> 48:00.693
Trust me, it ends there.

48:03.429 --> 48:05.462
I have complete control
of the situation.

48:05.563 --> 48:08.198
I'm sure.

48:08.299 --> 48:11.267
I do.

48:11.368 --> 48:13.101
Yep.

48:15.070 --> 48:17.838
<i>Today was totally confusing.</i>

48:17.939 --> 48:19.405
<i>Do we choose when our heart</i>
<i>will move on,</i>

48:19.506 --> 48:23.775
<i>or is love completely out</i>
<i>of our control?</i>

48:23.876 --> 48:25.876
<i>We should allow our heart</i>

48:25.977 --> 48:30.814
<i>to take us where dreams</i>
<i>dare not go.</i>

48:30.915 --> 48:35.550
<i>Our heart is the only compass</i>
<i>that can point to true love.</i>

49:34.391 --> 49:35.125
Hey.

49:35.226 --> 49:36.191
Hey.

49:36.292 --> 49:37.459
What are you working on?

49:37.560 --> 49:40.928
I am replacing the hose seal
for that fermentation tank.

49:42.264 --> 49:43.196
Are you gonna check those?

49:43.297 --> 49:44.264
Oh, yeah.

49:44.365 --> 49:47.133
Later today I'll be checking
the acid levels.

49:47.234 --> 49:50.335
I meant those text messages.

49:50.436 --> 49:52.436
Yeah.

49:52.537 --> 49:54.772
Rafaelie, right?

49:54.873 --> 49:57.540
I saw photos of her,
she's really pretty.

49:57.641 --> 49:58.940
Pictures, where?

49:59.041 --> 50:00.809
On your website.

50:00.910 --> 50:03.110
You saw my website?

50:03.211 --> 50:05.078
Liz was curious.

50:07.515 --> 50:08.847
It could be important.

50:08.948 --> 50:10.349
I seriously doubt that.

50:10.450 --> 50:11.116
Oh!

50:14.620 --> 50:19.955
Ok, well, I guess no more
messages from Rafaelie.

50:20.056 --> 50:22.957
I should grab that.

52:06.129 --> 52:06.996
Molly?

52:09.198 --> 52:10.332
Did you take my picture?

52:10.433 --> 52:11.765
I did.

52:11.867 --> 52:13.033
It was a beautiful moment.

52:13.134 --> 52:14.767
Let me see.

52:14.869 --> 52:16.002
That's not bad.

52:16.103 --> 52:19.471
Usually photos of me have
this blinky, dopey face.

52:26.978 --> 52:30.012
Maybe we should get back
to work.

52:30.113 --> 52:31.546
Maybe.

52:38.552 --> 52:40.286
Yeah.

52:56.198 --> 52:57.831
I can't believe we did it.

52:57.932 --> 52:58.565
Yeah.

52:58.666 --> 52:59.932
50 years of stuff in there.

53:00.033 --> 53:06.271
Some of it good,
the rest not so much.

53:06.372 --> 53:09.239
Still not enough to justify
the counter-offer.

53:09.340 --> 53:12.041
I... I don't know what
I'm gonna do.

53:12.142 --> 53:12.908
You're pretty smart.

53:13.009 --> 53:17.311
I'm sure you'll figure
something out.

53:17.412 --> 53:22.814
So... when does Rafaelie
get back?

53:22.916 --> 53:26.284
Well, I'm not so sure
she's coming back.

53:26.385 --> 53:28.719
Oh?

53:28.820 --> 53:31.922
She hooked up with her ex
in Spain.

53:32.023 --> 53:32.321
I'm sorry.

53:32.455 --> 53:33.489
Oh, no.

53:33.590 --> 53:36.925
No, I'm good.

53:40.428 --> 53:44.063
Hey, do you remember
that time we went hiking

53:44.164 --> 53:46.164
and that storm came in?

53:46.265 --> 53:47.766
Dancing in the rain?

53:47.867 --> 53:49.199
Yes.

53:49.301 --> 53:50.167
Oh, the double rainbow.

53:50.268 --> 53:51.001
Yeah.

53:51.102 --> 53:52.068
I wish we had that photo.

53:52.169 --> 53:54.871
That was once in a lifetime.

53:58.041 --> 54:00.241
Once in a lifetime.

54:05.545 --> 54:08.713
Hi, Greg.

54:08.814 --> 54:11.415
Yes, I will come pick you up.

54:11.516 --> 54:12.416
No, no.

54:12.517 --> 54:15.184
Don't drive anywhere,
that would be stupid.

54:15.285 --> 54:19.854
Clearly you've had a lot
to drink.

54:19.956 --> 54:24.058
Yes, and the Rickster.

54:24.158 --> 54:25.858
Alright, I'll be on my way.

54:25.960 --> 54:30.128
Don't move.

54:32.464 --> 54:33.331
I have to go.

54:33.432 --> 54:35.799
I heard.

54:37.867 --> 54:39.468
Um, listen.

54:39.569 --> 54:41.736
I... I'm going to talk to
Randall about keeping you on.

54:41.837 --> 54:43.104
I don't want you to lose
your job.

54:43.205 --> 54:44.171
No, please.

54:44.272 --> 54:46.440
Don't go out of your way
for me, I'll be fine.

54:46.541 --> 54:48.107
Look, I really should tell
you that-

54:48.208 --> 54:48.841
No, really.

54:48.942 --> 54:50.075
It's no trouble.

54:50.176 --> 54:52.210
You're good at what you do.

54:55.847 --> 54:57.013
I guess I'll see you around.

54:57.114 --> 54:57.947
Yeah. Yeah.

54:58.048 --> 54:59.848
I'm sure.

55:17.261 --> 55:20.429
Ok.

55:20.530 --> 55:21.764
Bye.

55:21.865 --> 55:22.464
Ok.

55:36.842 --> 55:38.908
What are you doing?

55:39.010 --> 55:40.343
I had to know what stage
we were at.

55:40.444 --> 55:41.544
When your phone smashed

55:41.645 --> 55:44.313
I was worried about the
effectiveness of phase two.

55:44.414 --> 55:49.816
So I got this postcard from
Rafaelie breaking up with me.

55:49.917 --> 55:50.951
Nice touch.

55:51.052 --> 55:52.718
It's the touch of a master.

55:52.819 --> 55:53.919
Now it's time for phase three.

55:54.021 --> 55:55.286
No more phases.

55:55.388 --> 55:56.087
You'll like this one.

55:56.188 --> 55:57.088
No, I said no.

55:57.189 --> 55:59.390
We've had luck so far,
but it ends now.

55:59.491 --> 56:02.291
But there's no more mariachi
bands, I promise.

56:02.393 --> 56:04.160
But there is so much more.

56:04.261 --> 56:06.995
Phase three is like a shaken
pop can of creativity.

56:07.096 --> 56:10.431
Once opened it will explode
with foamy brilliance.

56:15.368 --> 56:17.036
What's in phase three?

56:17.137 --> 56:19.904
We crush the competition.

56:20.005 --> 56:21.171
Always with the crushing.

56:21.272 --> 56:22.672
Why do you have
to crush people?

56:22.774 --> 56:23.407
It's what we do.

56:23.508 --> 56:25.174
We work in a winery.

56:25.275 --> 56:26.742
Ok, fair enough.

56:26.843 --> 56:28.343
To the Jackson-mobile.

56:28.444 --> 56:30.878
I have to find a parrot.

56:46.190 --> 56:48.157
Guys, guys, guys!

56:48.258 --> 56:49.258
Enough! Enough!

56:49.359 --> 56:51.859
Please! Enough.

56:55.430 --> 56:56.229
I think I'm gonna be sick.

56:56.330 --> 56:57.096
No, no, no, no, no.

56:57.197 --> 56:58.230
Ok, ok.

56:58.331 --> 56:59.798
This way, this way.

56:59.899 --> 57:01.366
Go, go.

57:03.034 --> 57:04.301
Ok.

57:04.402 --> 57:05.102
Hey.

57:05.236 --> 57:07.036
Do you wanna, you know,
tango?

57:07.137 --> 57:07.703
No.

57:07.805 --> 57:08.604
No, Greg.

57:08.705 --> 57:09.838
I don't want to tango.

57:09.939 --> 57:11.273
Ok, ok.

57:11.374 --> 57:12.873
Ok, I gotta walk-

57:14.176 --> 57:16.009
Oh.

57:16.110 --> 57:16.943
You ok?

57:17.044 --> 57:18.111
Yeah.

57:18.212 --> 57:19.078
Much better now.

57:19.179 --> 57:20.979
Oh god, no, no, Greg, no!

57:27.919 --> 57:32.987
<i>A single ember is all it takes</i>
<i>to start a forest fire.</i>

57:33.089 --> 57:39.125
<i>Today I found that ember</i>
<i>still burning in Carmen.</i>

57:39.226 --> 57:42.160
<i>After all this time,</i>

57:42.261 --> 57:47.031
<i>our lives once again</i>
<i>intertwined.</i>

57:47.132 --> 57:51.034
<i>Perhaps this time our fire</i>
<i>will not fade but burn</i>

57:51.135 --> 57:54.369
<i>for the eternities.</i>

57:57.372 --> 58:00.173
Please tell me that piñata
is not part of phase three.

58:00.274 --> 58:01.141
No, man.

58:01.241 --> 58:02.908
It's for my little brother's
birthday.

58:03.009 --> 58:07.312
Why do you think the world
revolves around you?

58:07.413 --> 58:08.645
Nah, I'm just messing
with you.

58:08.746 --> 58:11.180
Yeah, it's for you.

58:11.281 --> 58:13.349
How is that for me?

58:13.450 --> 58:14.649
It's one of the many surprises

58:14.750 --> 58:17.852
that will launch Molly back
into your arms.

58:19.855 --> 58:21.087
What is it?

58:21.188 --> 58:24.323
Molly Dawson just reached
out to Jean-Luc Pierre again.

58:24.424 --> 58:25.657
What? No way.

58:25.758 --> 58:28.059
We've been chatting all week.

58:28.160 --> 58:29.927
Why are you not telling me this?

58:30.028 --> 58:31.361
I didn't want you to exploit it.

58:31.462 --> 58:34.230
It's sweet, simple stuff,
you know?

58:34.331 --> 58:35.898
About?

58:35.999 --> 58:38.733
Lost love, romance...

58:38.834 --> 58:40.701
everything I want to
talk to her about.

58:40.802 --> 58:41.869
Ay ay ay.

58:41.970 --> 58:44.137
Jean-Luc is smooth
and suave.

58:44.238 --> 58:45.204
You're neither, my friend.

58:45.305 --> 58:46.605
He's not real.

58:46.706 --> 58:49.007
I made him up after I developed
the website.

58:49.108 --> 58:50.841
And why did you do that?

58:50.942 --> 58:52.676
Because he's more interesting
than me.

58:52.777 --> 58:53.943
Bingo.

58:54.044 --> 58:55.145
Here, let me respond.

58:55.246 --> 58:56.979
No.

59:10.956 --> 59:14.691
<i>Molly, how was your day?</i>

59:14.792 --> 59:21.730
<i>My heart spoke to me, but</i>
<i>I didn't want to hear it.</i>

59:21.831 --> 59:25.965
<i>Isn't it better to love</i>
<i>than carry pain?</i>

59:26.066 --> 59:29.101
<i>If only life were that easy.</i>

59:29.202 --> 59:32.303
<i>Complications stand</i>
<i>in my way.</i>

59:32.404 --> 59:35.972
<i>We build our walls and</i>
<i>we can rip them down.</i>

59:36.073 --> 59:41.609
<i>Maybe that's what you need</i>
<i>to do to be happy.</i>

59:41.710 --> 59:43.811
<i>Thank you for talking with me.</i>

59:43.913 --> 59:45.345
<i>I know you're busy.</i>

59:45.446 --> 59:48.681
<i>My time was not misused</i>
<i>talking with you.</i>

59:48.782 --> 59:50.783
<i>Goodnight.</i>

59:59.857 --> 01:00:01.790
Phase three.

01:00:03.226 --> 01:00:04.892
Phase three.

01:00:11.264 --> 01:00:14.799
Yeah.

01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:17.168
Phase three.

01:00:21.555 --> 01:00:24.155
I'm staring at it right now.

01:00:24.257 --> 01:00:26.224
<i>And you're sure it looks</i>
<i>like me?</i>

01:00:26.325 --> 01:00:27.558
Sort of.

01:00:27.659 --> 01:00:29.693
I was pretty drunk last night.

01:00:29.794 --> 01:00:31.494
I'm sure Rick will remember.

01:00:31.595 --> 01:00:32.462
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

01:00:32.563 --> 01:00:34.429
Greg-

01:00:34.531 --> 01:00:39.734
Rickster, did you make
a piñata of my face?

01:00:45.405 --> 01:00:46.305
Woah, how did you-

01:00:46.405 --> 01:00:47.539
Sorry, Mol.

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:50.073
I had to have my assistant
hack your computer.

01:00:50.174 --> 01:00:51.475
I want to accept this counter

01:00:51.576 --> 01:00:52.809
but all I've gotten from Nancy

01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:55.278
is like sixteen texts why
I shouldn't.

01:00:55.379 --> 01:00:57.245
But it's nearly three times
market value.

01:00:57.346 --> 01:00:57.879
No, no, no.

01:00:57.980 --> 01:00:59.147
I can talk them down.

01:00:59.248 --> 01:01:00.514
Please don't Nancy me,
Molly.

01:01:00.615 --> 01:01:03.082
I make like half a million a
day on interest alone,

01:01:03.183 --> 01:01:04.851
so why would I care about price?

01:01:04.952 --> 01:01:07.152
Now, can't you just tell them
I agree?

01:01:07.253 --> 01:01:08.720
Not without Nancy's approval.

01:01:08.821 --> 01:01:09.754
I can get in trouble.

01:01:09.855 --> 01:01:10.688
I'll do anything.

01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:13.356
I'll up your commission
five percent.

01:01:13.457 --> 01:01:14.457
She's gonna find out.

01:01:14.559 --> 01:01:16.725
If she finds out we accepted
the offer,

01:01:16.826 --> 01:01:18.360
then I found a new
real estate agent.

01:01:18.461 --> 01:01:21.029
Ok, there's a friend of mine
who manages the vineyard.

01:01:21.130 --> 01:01:23.497
If I do this for you, you
keep him on as manager.

01:01:23.598 --> 01:01:24.231
Bummer.

01:01:24.332 --> 01:01:25.165
No can do.

01:01:25.266 --> 01:01:26.566
You just said you would
do anything.

01:01:26.667 --> 01:01:28.167
This deal is a corporate merger.

01:01:28.268 --> 01:01:30.268
The management from my
organic food line is in charge,

01:01:30.369 --> 01:01:31.269
not me.

01:01:31.370 --> 01:01:32.803
You can still try.

01:01:32.904 --> 01:01:34.271
Jackson runs the place.

01:01:34.372 --> 01:01:36.072
He brings serious value.

01:01:36.173 --> 01:01:37.740
Ok, I'll do what I can.

01:01:37.841 --> 01:01:40.409
But right now I need an answer.

01:01:47.782 --> 01:01:50.215
He accepted our offer.

01:01:50.317 --> 01:01:51.482
That's unbelievable.

01:01:51.584 --> 01:01:54.618
Jackson, you are the majority
shareholder

01:01:54.719 --> 01:01:57.054
and ultimately this
is your choice.

01:01:57.155 --> 01:02:01.189
But if it were me I'd take
the money and run.

01:02:09.463 --> 01:02:11.463
You've done a fine job

01:02:11.564 --> 01:02:14.198
maintaining such a huge online
presence, bro.

01:02:14.299 --> 01:02:16.200
I'm impressed you
figured it out.

01:02:16.301 --> 01:02:18.301
I have my ways.

01:02:18.402 --> 01:02:20.436
Sorry I had to snake it
off you like I did.

01:02:20.537 --> 01:02:22.304
I couldn't pass on the price.

01:02:22.405 --> 01:02:24.238
I think my next vineyard
will be in France.

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:26.174
Oh, I love Paris.

01:02:26.275 --> 01:02:28.141
The wine, the women,
the song.

01:02:30.844 --> 01:02:32.511
I'll have the real estate group
and my lawyers

01:02:32.613 --> 01:02:35.013
draw up the contracts on Monday
for everything.

01:02:35.114 --> 01:02:36.381
That'll be fine.

01:02:36.482 --> 01:02:39.750
And now I'd like to view
more of this awesome winery.

01:02:41.385 --> 01:02:42.619
I can have
Romeo give you the tour.

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:43.719
Do you mind?

01:02:43.820 --> 01:02:44.553
No problemo.

01:02:44.654 --> 01:02:46.554
This way, señor.

01:02:48.357 --> 01:02:50.423
Let's roll, amigo.

01:02:53.126 --> 01:02:54.126
Hey.

01:02:54.227 --> 01:02:55.327
Jackson.

01:02:55.428 --> 01:02:57.228
I've got some great news.

01:02:57.329 --> 01:02:58.429
<i>What's up?</i>

01:02:58.530 --> 01:03:00.263
Randall accepted
the counter-offer

01:03:00.365 --> 01:03:02.299
<i>and the owners are gonna sell.</i>

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:03.799
That's wonderful.

01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:05.267
You don't seem very excited.

01:03:05.369 --> 01:03:07.369
There's a deal point that
I'm still fighting for,

01:03:07.470 --> 01:03:08.670
but it's-it's looking good.

01:03:08.771 --> 01:03:09.603
Excellent.

01:03:09.704 --> 01:03:12.238
Hey, so we're having
a party tonight

01:03:12.339 --> 01:03:14.374
to ring in Valentine's Day.

01:03:14.475 --> 01:03:15.707
You should come.

01:03:15.808 --> 01:03:18.377
Plus, it's your birthday,
I didn't forget.

01:03:18.478 --> 01:03:22.012
Thanks for the invite,
and remembering.

01:03:22.113 --> 01:03:27.750
Listen, there's something I need
to tell you about the owners.

01:03:27.851 --> 01:03:31.319
Greg loves Molly.

01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:34.021
Oh my god.

01:03:34.122 --> 01:03:35.187
Molly, are you ok?

01:03:35.288 --> 01:03:35.988
Yeah.

01:03:36.089 --> 01:03:37.156
You-you were saying?

01:03:37.257 --> 01:03:38.523
You know what?

01:03:38.624 --> 01:03:40.025
We'll talk about it in person.

01:03:40.126 --> 01:03:40.625
<i>Tonight.</i>

01:03:40.726 --> 01:03:41.925
Good.

01:03:42.027 --> 01:03:44.461
I- I think there's a few things
we should talk about tonight.

01:03:44.562 --> 01:03:45.695
I'm glad you're coming.

01:03:45.796 --> 01:03:47.230
Me too.

01:03:47.331 --> 01:03:49.031
I wouldn't miss it.

01:03:49.132 --> 01:03:50.832
See you soon.

01:04:02.241 --> 01:04:03.274
Thank you, gorgeous.

01:04:06.778 --> 01:04:07.643
Hey, baby.

01:04:07.744 --> 01:04:08.611
Enough, ok?

01:04:08.712 --> 01:04:10.079
No more presents.

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:11.413
I've had enough.

01:04:11.514 --> 01:04:12.547
What are you talking about?

01:04:12.648 --> 01:04:16.150
My office is completely full!

01:04:16.251 --> 01:04:18.317
I can't take it anymore, ok?

01:04:18.419 --> 01:04:20.485
Honey bunny, I
only sent flowers.

01:04:20.586 --> 01:04:22.154
I was just expressing my love.

01:04:22.255 --> 01:04:24.455
Try a text message.

01:04:24.556 --> 01:04:26.723
Greg loves Molly.

01:04:26.824 --> 01:04:28.158
Molly.

01:04:28.259 --> 01:04:31.060
My office, now.

01:04:32.696 --> 01:04:34.295
Crap.

01:04:34.396 --> 01:04:36.530
<i> Oh, crap.</i>

01:04:40.233 --> 01:04:41.667
She'll get over it.

01:04:41.768 --> 01:04:43.101
Yeah.

01:04:46.504 --> 01:04:47.838
Jose.

01:04:51.175 --> 01:04:52.508
He's letting all of us keep
our jobs!

01:04:53.810 --> 01:04:54.976
Great news.

01:04:55.078 --> 01:04:56.477
How's it going with Molly?

01:04:56.578 --> 01:04:59.179
She's asked me to come
to her Valentine's party.

01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:00.313
Ole!

01:05:00.414 --> 01:05:01.614
Phase three was a success!

01:05:01.716 --> 01:05:03.382
Now onto phase four.

01:05:03.483 --> 01:05:07.151
You get your woman back
and become a man.

01:05:07.252 --> 01:05:08.453
Romeo, look.

01:05:08.554 --> 01:05:12.121
I'm thinking of putting my own
spin on phase four.

01:05:12.222 --> 01:05:13.122
Careful, amigo.

01:05:13.223 --> 01:05:15.157
Phase four is very delicate.

01:05:15.258 --> 01:05:18.226
Ok, hear me out.

01:05:18.327 --> 01:05:20.394
Jean-Luc is courageous.

01:05:20.495 --> 01:05:23.096
He is expressive and poetic.

01:05:23.197 --> 01:05:24.130
He totally owns it.

01:05:24.231 --> 01:05:24.731
Totally true.

01:05:24.832 --> 01:05:26.364
But I gotta own him.

01:05:26.466 --> 01:05:30.434
I invented the guy,
so technically he's me.

01:05:30.535 --> 01:05:33.103
Tonight I'm going to be more
like Jean-Luc

01:05:33.204 --> 01:05:39.440
and I'm going to be 100 percent
honest with Molly.

01:05:39.541 --> 01:05:41.608
You're scaring me, amigo.

01:05:46.813 --> 01:05:50.148
Yeah, I got a beach house
in Cabo with a hot tub.

01:05:50.249 --> 01:05:52.116
Tequila sunrise.

01:05:53.184 --> 01:05:54.617
Hey, Liz.

01:05:55.819 --> 01:05:57.586
Psst!

01:06:00.523 --> 01:06:01.589
I have something
planned tonight.

01:06:01.690 --> 01:06:05.291
I never would have guessed it.

01:06:05.392 --> 01:06:06.226
Look.

01:06:06.327 --> 01:06:08.060
Oh, Greg.

01:06:08.161 --> 01:06:09.394
No.

01:06:11.163 --> 01:06:14.664
I'm going to ask Molly
to marry me.

01:06:14.766 --> 01:06:16.600
You need to calm down.

01:06:16.701 --> 01:06:17.867
I need advice.

01:06:17.968 --> 01:06:20.602
Rick told me that I should
propose in front of an audience

01:06:20.703 --> 01:06:22.604
so that Molly's too
embarrassed to say no.

01:06:22.705 --> 01:06:25.139
But I really want her to say
yes because she means it,

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:26.440
but then it has to be perfect.

01:06:26.541 --> 01:06:30.275
So, how do you propose?

01:06:30.376 --> 01:06:34.445
Um, well, first thing's first,
you start on your knees.

01:06:34.546 --> 01:06:36.379
Ok, good.

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:39.315
Both or one?

01:06:39.416 --> 01:06:41.950
Both.

01:06:42.051 --> 01:06:44.152
Ok.

01:06:45.554 --> 01:06:47.287
Should I sing?

01:07:06.034 --> 01:07:07.234
Romeo!

01:07:07.335 --> 01:07:09.335
Hola, Liz.

01:07:09.436 --> 01:07:11.070
You look fantastic.

01:07:11.172 --> 01:07:12.871
Thank you.

01:07:12.972 --> 01:07:14.573
Happy birthday.

01:07:20.645 --> 01:07:21.944
So this is new for me.

01:07:22.045 --> 01:07:22.945
Thank you.

01:07:23.046 --> 01:07:24.580
Valentine's Eve.

01:07:24.681 --> 01:07:27.615
Greg's brainchild.

01:07:27.716 --> 01:07:29.316
A toast.

01:07:29.417 --> 01:07:31.517
To a job well done.

01:07:31.618 --> 01:07:33.653
Cheers.

01:07:36.489 --> 01:07:38.989
Yeah, I bought this dress
specifically for tonight.

01:07:39.090 --> 01:07:39.723
I like it.

01:07:39.825 --> 01:07:42.225
It's like camouflage roses.

01:07:43.561 --> 01:07:48.229
And then you end it
with a plea for your life.

01:07:48.330 --> 01:07:49.997
That's intense.

01:07:50.098 --> 01:07:51.898
You got all that?

01:07:51.999 --> 01:07:53.233
I think so.

01:07:53.334 --> 01:07:54.633
Good.

01:07:54.734 --> 01:07:56.669
Really good.

01:07:58.237 --> 01:07:59.170
Molly, listen.

01:07:59.271 --> 01:08:00.938
There's something I really need
to tell you.

01:08:01.039 --> 01:08:02.272
But I need to tell you
about this deal point.

01:08:02.373 --> 01:08:03.373
No, no. Let me go first.

01:08:03.474 --> 01:08:04.473
I don't know how else
to say this

01:08:04.575 --> 01:08:06.042
so I'm just gonna
put it out there.

01:08:06.143 --> 01:08:06.676
I own-

01:08:06.777 --> 01:08:09.511
Molly.

01:08:09.612 --> 01:08:12.446
We finally get to meet
in the flesh.

01:08:12.547 --> 01:08:14.480
This party is smokin'.

01:08:14.582 --> 01:08:16.015
Radical idea.

01:08:16.116 --> 01:08:17.448
Randall, I would like you to
meet the manager

01:08:17.550 --> 01:08:18.450
of Broken Heart.

01:08:18.551 --> 01:08:19.917
Manager?

01:08:20.018 --> 01:08:20.885
As if.

01:08:20.986 --> 01:08:22.386
Jackson's no poser.

01:08:22.487 --> 01:08:23.620
How're you doing, brosef?

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:24.421
Hey.

01:08:24.522 --> 01:08:25.622
You guys know each other?

01:08:25.723 --> 01:08:27.022
Oh yeah.

01:08:27.122 --> 01:08:29.225
We shared a bottle of sick
chardonnay just this afternoon.

01:08:29.326 --> 01:08:31.326
Couldn't buy Broken Heart
without meeting the owner first,

01:08:31.426 --> 01:08:32.493
right dude?

01:08:32.595 --> 01:08:34.294
Your offer was very,
very generous.

01:08:34.395 --> 01:08:35.395
Thank you.

01:08:36.596 --> 01:08:37.529
Oh, times up.

01:08:37.631 --> 01:08:39.598
You know what that means,
Molly.

01:08:39.698 --> 01:08:43.133
Adios amigos.

01:08:43.234 --> 01:08:46.169
Wait, you're-you're the owner?

01:08:46.270 --> 01:08:47.403
Yeah.

01:08:47.504 --> 01:08:49.005
I don't feel so good.

01:08:49.104 --> 01:08:50.272
It's just nerves, buddy.

01:08:50.372 --> 01:08:51.473
You got this.

01:08:51.573 --> 01:08:52.907
You got this.

01:08:53.008 --> 01:08:53.407
Yeah.

01:08:53.508 --> 01:08:54.207
Yeah.

01:08:54.309 --> 01:08:54.975
Yeah, I got this.

01:08:55.077 --> 01:08:55.942
Yeah.

01:08:56.042 --> 01:08:56.643
I can do it.

01:08:56.743 --> 01:08:57.877
Yeah.

01:08:57.979 --> 01:08:58.612
Absolutely.

01:08:58.712 --> 01:09:00.011
Yeah.

01:09:00.113 --> 01:09:01.513
Ok.

01:09:02.982 --> 01:09:04.249
I've been trying to tell you.

01:09:04.350 --> 01:09:05.149
Molly-

01:09:05.251 --> 01:09:06.049
Hold on.

01:09:06.184 --> 01:09:07.117
I- when were you going to
tell me?

01:09:07.218 --> 01:09:08.085
Yesterday?

01:09:08.185 --> 01:09:09.085
The day before that?

01:09:09.185 --> 01:09:10.219
Molly... I was going to tell
you tonight.

01:09:10.319 --> 01:09:12.554
I was worried sick about you
losing your job.

01:09:12.654 --> 01:09:13.287
Molly!

01:09:13.389 --> 01:09:15.089
What?

01:09:19.158 --> 01:09:20.393
Oh god.

01:09:20.493 --> 01:09:23.328
This went straight past go
and right into weird.

01:09:23.429 --> 01:09:24.395
Rick?

01:09:24.497 --> 01:09:25.263
Yeah?

01:09:25.363 --> 01:09:27.964
What are you doing?

01:09:28.064 --> 01:09:29.832
Moral support, brother.

01:09:29.934 --> 01:09:30.500
Moral support.

01:09:30.635 --> 01:09:32.835
Greg, what is going on?

01:09:32.935 --> 01:09:38.205
All-all my life I've searched
for a woman

01:09:38.305 --> 01:09:41.307
that gets me and compliments
my style.

01:09:41.408 --> 01:09:42.241
I like that.

01:09:42.341 --> 01:09:43.276
It's cool.

01:09:43.377 --> 01:09:47.045
And, well, well I-Molly.

01:09:48.145 --> 01:09:49.078
Molly.

01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:51.080
I'm proposing down here,
honey bunny.

01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:52.582
Um...

01:09:55.084 --> 01:09:58.352
will you marry me?

01:09:58.453 --> 01:10:00.254
Oh god, please say yes.

01:10:00.354 --> 01:10:03.056
<i>Jackson?</i>

01:10:03.157 --> 01:10:03.856
Huh?

01:10:03.957 --> 01:10:04.890
<i>Jackson?</i>

01:10:04.991 --> 01:10:06.292
Vanessa?

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:09.460
Vanessa?

01:10:09.561 --> 01:10:11.528
What are you doing here?

01:10:13.397 --> 01:10:14.230
Oh god.

01:10:14.331 --> 01:10:15.364
Greg?

01:10:23.737 --> 01:10:24.971
What?

01:10:25.072 --> 01:10:26.205
Are you talking to me?

01:10:26.306 --> 01:10:28.507
You do kinda look like
your daddy.

01:10:33.744 --> 01:10:35.545
Are you talking to me?

01:10:35.646 --> 01:10:37.279
Are you saying hello?

01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:39.048
Yeah.

01:10:39.149 --> 01:10:40.214
Are you talking to me?

01:10:40.316 --> 01:10:42.050
Hey, that's cute.

01:10:42.151 --> 01:10:43.650
You with a baby.

01:10:43.751 --> 01:10:44.685
Go away.

01:10:44.786 --> 01:10:46.385
You're scaring the baby
and you're drunk.

01:10:46.486 --> 01:10:47.954
I am not drunk.

01:10:48.055 --> 01:10:51.356
I'm just intoxicated by you.

01:10:51.457 --> 01:10:54.191
Hey little baby, baby, baby.

01:10:55.659 --> 01:10:56.926
Baby, baby, baby, baby.

01:10:57.027 --> 01:10:58.027
Greg.

01:10:58.128 --> 01:10:59.294
What?

01:10:59.395 --> 01:11:00.462
You're scaring the baby.

01:11:02.197 --> 01:11:02.997
I'm not good with kids.

01:11:03.098 --> 01:11:04.665
That's why I got fixed.

01:11:04.766 --> 01:11:06.299
You're what?

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:07.968
Snip, snip.

01:11:08.069 --> 01:11:09.435
Oh, news flash, right?

01:11:09.536 --> 01:11:11.136
No Bandidos for me.

01:11:11.237 --> 01:11:13.938
Kids were always
my parents' thing.

01:11:14.039 --> 01:11:16.707
Ain't no one calling me daddy
but you.

01:11:25.547 --> 01:11:27.348
Hi.

01:11:28.649 --> 01:11:30.616
I'm gonna go.

01:11:30.718 --> 01:11:32.084
Bar rules.

01:11:32.185 --> 01:11:33.385
No one under twenty-one
allowed.

01:11:33.486 --> 01:11:35.019
That goes for babies.

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:36.220
Did I propose to you?

01:11:36.321 --> 01:11:37.421
Greg, stop.

01:11:37.522 --> 01:11:39.589
What's going on?

01:11:39.690 --> 01:11:41.557
Vanessa is running off to Canada
with her new husband.

01:11:41.658 --> 01:11:43.492
She's giving me custody.

01:11:43.593 --> 01:11:45.526
Canada.

01:11:45.627 --> 01:11:47.361
Any other lies?

01:11:47.462 --> 01:11:51.097
No. It's the truth.

01:11:57.035 --> 01:11:59.403
Man, you gotta feel
for the guy.

01:11:59.504 --> 01:12:01.337
Single dad.

01:12:01.438 --> 01:12:02.238
Rickster!

01:12:02.339 --> 01:12:03.638
Where's the piñata of my head?

01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:04.639
It's almost midnight.

01:12:04.741 --> 01:12:06.108
Let's go get it, brother.

01:12:06.209 --> 01:12:07.675
Let's go.

01:12:20.118 --> 01:12:22.885
Are you really gonna let Jackson
walk away?

01:12:22.986 --> 01:12:24.253
What?

01:12:24.354 --> 01:12:26.354
It's pretty clear which one
is Mr. Right.

01:12:26.455 --> 01:12:28.189
Which?

01:12:28.290 --> 01:12:29.357
Come on, girl.

01:12:29.457 --> 01:12:31.325
You always go for the wrong guy.

01:12:31.426 --> 01:12:33.559
And I don't know if it's
because you're afraid of love

01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:35.428
or because you just
don't know what true love is.

01:12:35.529 --> 01:12:37.062
And that's coming from me.

01:12:37.163 --> 01:12:38.463
What are you talking about?

01:12:38.564 --> 01:12:42.233
It's obvious Jackson is madly
in love with you.

01:12:42.333 --> 01:12:43.867
Men are dumb.

01:12:43.968 --> 01:12:45.402
Sometimes you just have
to accept it

01:12:45.503 --> 01:12:47.503
and take them at face value.

01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:54.007
Jackson.

01:12:57.611 --> 01:13:00.078
It's two minutes to V-Day!

01:13:04.282 --> 01:13:05.348
<i>That's my face.</i>

01:13:05.449 --> 01:13:07.250
<i>We're gonna smash it.</i>

01:13:09.118 --> 01:13:10.218
So what do you think?

01:13:10.319 --> 01:13:14.455
It's gonna be you and me now,
buddy.

01:13:14.556 --> 01:13:16.089
It's gonna be some ride.

01:13:26.631 --> 01:13:27.797
Jackson?

01:13:27.898 --> 01:13:29.865
Wait.

01:13:29.966 --> 01:13:31.433
What about Rafaelie?

01:13:31.534 --> 01:13:35.035
What if she comes back?

01:13:35.136 --> 01:13:38.071
She's not real.

01:13:38.172 --> 01:13:38.905
What?

01:13:39.006 --> 01:13:40.139
I made her up.

01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:45.509
Well, Romeo did, with this
virtual girlfriend web thing.

01:13:45.610 --> 01:13:47.011
It was all very confusing

01:13:47.111 --> 01:13:50.446
and I didn't want to go along
with it, but I did.

01:13:50.547 --> 01:13:52.147
Is anything that you say true?

01:13:52.248 --> 01:13:54.148
Of course!

01:13:54.249 --> 01:13:59.052
But you had Greg and...
and I didn't...

01:13:59.153 --> 01:14:03.122
want to look like I was alone.

01:14:03.223 --> 01:14:11.994
Because I am alone and have been
since you left.

01:14:12.096 --> 01:14:13.295
Well, you should have thought
about that

01:14:13.396 --> 01:14:15.831
before you slept with Vanessa.

01:14:15.932 --> 01:14:20.366
When I look into my child's
eyes I can't regret what I did.

01:14:20.468 --> 01:14:21.968
I can't change that,

01:14:22.069 --> 01:14:26.204
and I can't change how I still
feel about you.

01:14:26.305 --> 01:14:29.840
I'm sorry, Jackson.

01:14:29.941 --> 01:14:31.842
I can't go backwards.

01:14:31.943 --> 01:14:33.876
But it's not backwards.

01:14:33.977 --> 01:14:36.778
We've been moving forward
this entire time.

01:14:36.879 --> 01:14:38.913
We've been healing.

01:14:39.013 --> 01:14:40.981
You felt it.

01:14:41.082 --> 01:14:42.982
I know you have.

01:14:52.957 --> 01:14:55.457
I think you should leave.

01:15:08.467 --> 01:15:10.368
Jackson?

01:15:12.137 --> 01:15:14.438
Happy birthday.

01:15:52.198 --> 01:15:58.234
<i> Nine... eight...</i>
<i>seven... six... five... four...</i>

01:15:58.335 --> 01:16:01.303
<i>three... two... one...</i>

01:16:01.404 --> 01:16:06.140
Yeah!

01:16:57.310 --> 01:16:59.210
Hey, fiancé!

01:16:59.311 --> 01:17:01.278
Happy Valentine's Day.

01:17:01.379 --> 01:17:03.580
Greg, Rick, what are you guys
doing here?

01:17:03.681 --> 01:17:04.581
What are you talking about?

01:17:04.682 --> 01:17:05.347
We're engaged.

01:17:05.448 --> 01:17:06.348
No, we aren't.

01:17:06.449 --> 01:17:08.416
Besides, you were too drunk
to remember.

01:17:08.517 --> 01:17:09.850
You said "yes".

01:17:09.952 --> 01:17:11.251
I said "Vanessa".

01:17:11.352 --> 01:17:12.219
That's odd.

01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:13.954
Greg, it's over.

01:17:14.055 --> 01:17:14.753
How so?

01:17:14.854 --> 01:17:16.422
Like, over, over.

01:17:16.523 --> 01:17:18.890
No longer dating, not
engaged, no visits, no calls,

01:17:18.991 --> 01:17:21.325
no emails
because it's over.

01:17:21.426 --> 01:17:21.992
Honey bunny.

01:17:22.093 --> 01:17:23.093
Just stop!

01:17:23.194 --> 01:17:24.527
If I hear you call me that
pet name one more time

01:17:24.628 --> 01:17:27.395
I swear to god I will strangle
you with my bare hands.

01:17:27.496 --> 01:17:30.398
I saw you kissing the waitress
last night.

01:17:30.499 --> 01:17:31.298
Oh, her?

01:17:31.399 --> 01:17:33.133
She's practically
my third cousin.

01:17:33.235 --> 01:17:33.867
We were drunk.

01:17:33.968 --> 01:17:35.201
It meant nothing, really.

01:17:35.302 --> 01:17:36.302
I can vouch for that.

01:17:36.403 --> 01:17:37.269
You.

01:17:37.370 --> 01:17:39.271
You third wheel,
get out!

01:17:39.372 --> 01:17:40.038
Third wheel?

01:17:40.139 --> 01:17:41.939
Both of you,
get out!

01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:42.506
Out, out, out!

01:17:42.608 --> 01:17:43.307
It's over.

01:17:43.408 --> 01:17:44.140
Over!

01:17:44.242 --> 01:17:45.208
I bought you a new car.

01:17:45.309 --> 01:17:46.209
I liked my old one.

01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:47.343
And a house.

01:17:47.444 --> 01:17:49.411
I would rather sell my soul
than move in with you.

01:17:49.512 --> 01:17:51.079
Now get out.

01:17:52.281 --> 01:17:53.847
Can we at least stay friends?

01:17:53.948 --> 01:17:56.216
I could never take the place
of the Rickster.

01:17:59.353 --> 01:18:00.252
It's ok, man.

01:18:00.353 --> 01:18:02.153
We've still got each other.

01:18:02.255 --> 01:18:03.220
In his face?

01:18:03.321 --> 01:18:04.555
Yep.

01:18:04.656 --> 01:18:06.456
I wish I could have helped.

01:18:06.557 --> 01:18:10.792
He's so cute but so dumb.

01:18:10.893 --> 01:18:13.160
I am done dating.

01:18:13.262 --> 01:18:15.496
Apparently I'm no good at it.

01:18:15.597 --> 01:18:17.330
We're all fakers when it comes
to dating.

01:18:17.431 --> 01:18:18.798
That's why I'm walking away.

01:18:18.899 --> 01:18:20.299
Done and done.

01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:22.167
I never took you for a quitter.

01:18:22.269 --> 01:18:23.735
Yes, I am a quitter.

01:18:23.836 --> 01:18:26.069
And I accept it.

01:18:26.170 --> 01:18:27.804
Well, for what it's worth you're
not the only one quitting

01:18:27.905 --> 01:18:29.505
on Valentine's Day.

01:18:29.606 --> 01:18:30.873
What, you too?

01:18:30.974 --> 01:18:32.174
Hell no.

01:18:32.275 --> 01:18:33.808
I was talking about Jean-Luc.

01:18:33.909 --> 01:18:36.877
He posted his final chapter
this morning.

01:18:36.978 --> 01:18:38.845
Final chapter?

01:18:48.853 --> 01:18:52.821
<i>Valentine's Day will be</i>
<i>my last entry.</i>

01:18:52.922 --> 01:18:54.390
<i>I find it suiting that I'm</i>
<i>posting this</i>

01:18:54.491 --> 01:18:57.759
<i>on such an iconic day.</i>

01:18:57.860 --> 01:19:00.227
<i>But a new path has been</i>
<i>presented to me.</i>

01:19:00.328 --> 01:19:02.995
<i>Someone came into my life</i>
<i>who was unexpected</i>

01:19:03.096 --> 01:19:07.165
<i>but very welcome.</i>

01:19:07.266 --> 01:19:10.167
<i>What I feel for this new life</i>
<i>I cannot explain.</i>

01:19:10.268 --> 01:19:14.070
<i>Words don't transcend</i>
<i>this level of love.</i>

01:19:20.442 --> 01:19:21.975
Hey, where are you off to?

01:19:22.076 --> 01:19:25.744
Uh, my class at
the cultural centre.

01:19:25.845 --> 01:19:28.446
I'm sorry.

01:19:28.547 --> 01:19:30.814
You tried.

01:19:30.915 --> 01:19:32.816
No longer undefeated.

01:19:32.917 --> 01:19:35.084
Yes.

01:19:39.555 --> 01:19:43.390
But the Latin lover
will rise again.

01:19:43.490 --> 01:19:44.757
Yeah.

01:19:44.858 --> 01:19:46.958
See you around.

01:19:48.161 --> 01:19:50.027
Molly, stay.

01:20:04.972 --> 01:20:07.773
<i>Too complex are my feelings.</i>

01:20:07.874 --> 01:20:09.041
<i>My love was everything</i>
<i>I remember</i>

01:20:09.142 --> 01:20:13.043
<i>and yet she's become</i>
<i>so much more.</i>

01:20:15.046 --> 01:20:18.381
<i>How could I ask a butterfly</i>
<i>to not flap its wings?</i>

01:20:18.482 --> 01:20:20.248
<i>I've discovered that love</i>
<i>isn't perfect</i>

01:20:20.350 --> 01:20:22.850
<i>but it isn't blind, either.</i>

01:20:22.951 --> 01:20:26.386
<i>It sees with so much more</i>
<i>clarity than you or I.</i>

01:20:26.487 --> 01:20:29.988
<i>It's our human imperfections</i>
<i>that cloud love.</i>

01:20:30.090 --> 01:20:33.024
<i>So again, I have lost her.</i>

01:20:33.125 --> 01:20:36.026
<i>But I will never stop dreaming</i>
<i>that someday my true love</i>

01:20:36.127 --> 01:20:39.095
<i>will cross my path once again.</i>

01:20:39.196 --> 01:20:46.834
<i>And maybe this time we'll be</i>
<i>ready for each other.</i>

01:20:46.935 --> 01:20:50.937
<i>Love is often spoken,</i>
<i>but seldom found.</i>

01:20:58.209 --> 01:21:02.478
Oh my god.

01:21:02.579 --> 01:21:04.846
Hey.

01:21:04.947 --> 01:21:07.014
Are you ok?

01:21:07.116 --> 01:21:08.949
Jean-Luc.

01:21:09.050 --> 01:21:10.584
Jean-Luc.

01:21:12.119 --> 01:21:13.786
Uh, Molly?

01:21:13.887 --> 01:21:16.788
I think you're having a complete
romantic meltdown.

01:21:16.889 --> 01:21:18.021
That says "for owner's
eyes only".

01:21:18.123 --> 01:21:21.424
And you just ripped it.

01:21:21.525 --> 01:21:23.159
It's the purchase agreement.

01:21:25.962 --> 01:21:27.062
Jean-Luc is a fraud.

01:21:27.162 --> 01:21:27.762
What?

01:21:27.863 --> 01:21:29.296
Look. Right here.

01:21:29.398 --> 01:21:30.430
Wine, women, and song.

01:21:30.531 --> 01:21:33.299
Broken Heart Winery
investment group own the site?

01:21:33.401 --> 01:21:34.299
A fraud!

01:21:34.401 --> 01:21:36.402
He lied to me again!

01:21:36.503 --> 01:21:37.568
That's what Randall was after.

01:21:37.669 --> 01:21:39.103
It wasn't the vineyard he
was paying so much for.

01:21:39.204 --> 01:21:40.337
He wanted Jean-Luc!

01:21:40.438 --> 01:21:42.038
More lies.

01:21:42.140 --> 01:21:44.273
I spent nights talking to him
through messenger

01:21:44.374 --> 01:21:45.341
thinking it was Jean-Luc,

01:21:45.442 --> 01:21:48.476
this whole time it was Jackson
and I'm Carmen.

01:21:48.577 --> 01:21:50.277
He has hurt me enough.

01:21:50.378 --> 01:21:53.013
I'm going to find him and I
am going to let him know

01:21:53.113 --> 01:21:56.948
how much I can't stand his
lying, no-good, cheating face.

01:21:57.049 --> 01:21:57.949
I agree.

01:21:58.084 --> 01:22:00.351
You need closure and
I am coming with you.

01:22:00.452 --> 01:22:01.452
Fine. Let's go.

01:22:01.553 --> 01:22:04.020
Uh uh. I'm driving
because you're crazy.

01:22:08.591 --> 01:22:09.957
Romeo?

01:22:10.058 --> 01:22:10.925
Where is he?

01:22:11.026 --> 01:22:12.427
The cultural centre,
that's all I know.

01:22:12.527 --> 01:22:13.059
Get in.

01:22:13.161 --> 01:22:14.060
Why?

01:22:14.162 --> 01:22:15.495
In case you're lying.

01:22:18.365 --> 01:22:20.064
Kick it, Liz.

01:22:25.236 --> 01:22:28.171
Life's not always gonna be
easy, buddy.

01:22:28.272 --> 01:22:30.238
Nope.

01:22:30.339 --> 01:22:32.940
But I'm always gonna be
here for you.

01:22:33.041 --> 01:22:35.009
You can always count on Dad.

01:22:35.110 --> 01:22:37.744
'Cause I love you.

01:22:37.845 --> 01:22:39.144
I love you so much.

01:22:42.548 --> 01:22:46.450
I will always be there
for you.

01:22:46.551 --> 01:22:48.484
He is a good man,
it's not his fault.

01:22:48.585 --> 01:22:49.452
Who's fault is it?

01:22:49.553 --> 01:22:51.453
That's not important.

01:22:51.554 --> 01:22:53.288
But he is a good man and
he cares very, very much.

01:22:53.389 --> 01:22:54.422
We all love him.

01:22:54.523 --> 01:22:57.157
And he loves you.

01:22:57.258 --> 01:22:58.324
<i>He'll give you babies</i>
<i>with straight teeth.</i>

01:22:58.425 --> 01:23:00.460
<i>Shut up, Romeo.</i>

01:23:02.161 --> 01:23:06.964
And here is where Daddy teaches.

01:23:07.065 --> 01:23:08.898
Right?

01:23:08.999 --> 01:23:10.833
Wanna go in?

01:23:19.841 --> 01:23:20.773
Find him.

01:23:20.874 --> 01:23:22.441
Ok.

01:23:31.215 --> 01:23:32.448
Alright, spread out,
find him.

01:23:32.549 --> 01:23:34.049
Ok.

01:23:35.918 --> 01:23:38.886
Does anyone know how
Valentine's Day got its start?

01:23:38.987 --> 01:23:40.153
You all do?

01:23:40.254 --> 01:23:41.387
That's great.

01:23:41.489 --> 01:23:45.891
Well, it came to us from a
Roman priest named Valentinus,

01:23:45.992 --> 01:23:49.327
and he was jailed for a
crime he did not commit.

01:23:49.428 --> 01:23:52.895
Then he fell in love
with the jailer's daughter

01:23:52.996 --> 01:23:59.267
and he would write her letters
signed "your Valentine".

01:23:59.368 --> 01:24:01.301
You take the high road,
I'll take the low road.

01:24:01.402 --> 01:24:03.102
Ok.

01:24:05.506 --> 01:24:08.940
Of course, a few years later the
emperor declared February 14th

01:24:09.041 --> 01:24:12.076
a holy day in
honour of Valentinus and-

01:24:12.177 --> 01:24:12.809
Molly?

01:24:12.910 --> 01:24:14.377
You're Jean-Luc.

01:24:18.214 --> 01:24:20.147
C'est moi.

01:24:20.249 --> 01:24:21.916
How could you?

01:24:22.017 --> 01:24:23.316
I was under an NDA.

01:24:23.417 --> 01:24:25.918
You didn't have to pretend.

01:24:26.019 --> 01:24:26.952
Not to me.

01:24:27.053 --> 01:24:29.254
How could I not?

01:24:29.355 --> 01:24:31.656
You weren't speaking
to me otherwise,

01:24:31.757 --> 01:24:34.658
and I was in this
impossible situation.

01:24:34.759 --> 01:24:36.092
All this time I thought you
would run

01:24:36.193 --> 01:24:37.894
if you knew my true feelings.

01:24:37.995 --> 01:24:39.828
How can you say that?

01:24:39.929 --> 01:24:43.697
Because you never signed up
for me being a father.

01:24:43.798 --> 01:24:47.433
But I'm also a man prone
to doing stupid things

01:24:47.535 --> 01:24:56.172
who is deeply and madly
in love with you.

01:24:56.274 --> 01:24:59.675
I feel it in my heart every hour
of every day.

01:24:59.776 --> 01:25:04.078
I've tried to bury it
but it won't stay down.

01:25:04.178 --> 01:25:08.381
Love is often spoken
but seldom found.

01:25:08.482 --> 01:25:09.916
Well, I found it.

01:25:10.017 --> 01:25:11.850
With you, Molly.

01:25:11.951 --> 01:25:16.086
So when you're ready to
accept me I'll be here waiting.

01:25:18.822 --> 01:25:21.690
No more waiting.

01:25:21.791 --> 01:25:24.792
Promise me that you will never
lie to me again.

01:25:24.893 --> 01:25:25.793
I promise.

01:25:25.894 --> 01:25:27.260
And that's the truth.

01:25:27.361 --> 01:25:28.795
You know I don't go back.

01:25:28.896 --> 01:25:30.195
I know.

01:25:36.201 --> 01:25:40.903
So this is us.

01:25:41.004 --> 01:25:43.005
A family.

01:25:43.105 --> 01:25:45.907
Moving forward.

01:25:46.008 --> 01:25:47.975
Molly, I love you.

01:25:48.076 --> 01:25:51.311
Jackson, I love you, too.

01:26:26.235 --> 01:26:27.336
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

01:26:27.437 --> 01:26:29.904
<i>in a place kinda like Mexico</i>
<i>but newer...</i>

01:26:30.005 --> 01:26:31.972
<i>hey, let's all it New Mexico.</i>

01:26:32.073 --> 01:26:34.274
<i>There were two crazy kids.</i>

01:26:34.375 --> 01:26:36.208
<i>We can all be a little</i>
<i>crazy sometimes.</i>

01:26:36.309 --> 01:26:37.910
<i>Just like life.</i>

01:26:38.011 --> 01:26:39.077
<i>But when we find someone</i>

01:26:39.178 --> 01:26:41.145
<i>who's passion is compatible</i>
<i>with ours,</i>

01:26:41.246 --> 01:26:45.147
<i>we fall in mutual craziness</i>
<i>and call it love.</i>

01:26:45.248 --> 01:26:47.882
<i>And, like a grape vine,</i>
<i>there might be twists</i>

01:26:47.984 --> 01:26:51.151
<i>and new sprouts along the way,</i>
<i>like a new baby or two.</i>

01:26:51.252 --> 01:26:53.087
<i>Maybe some immigration</i>
<i>problems.</i>

01:26:53.188 --> 01:26:55.054
<i>But like my tia always says:</i>

01:26:55.155 --> 01:26:58.624
<i>it's nothing a good</i>
<i>mariachi band can't solve.</i>

01:26:58.725 --> 01:27:02.393
<i>So if you stick with it, love,</i>
<i>like a fine wine,</i>

01:27:02.494 --> 01:27:04.260
<i>will get better with time.</i>

01:27:04.362 --> 01:27:08.097
<i>From all of us</i>
<i>Feliz Valentine's Day.</i>
