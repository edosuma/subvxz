00:01.069 --> 00:03.888
Kids, never underestimate
the power of destiny.

00:04.299 --> 00:06.719
Because when you least expect it,
the littlest thing

00:06.729 --> 00:09.119
can cause a ripple effect
that changes your life.

00:09.753 --> 00:11.987
Take for instance
my trip to Chicago.

00:12.444 --> 00:14.803
That security guard was
a little bit handsy.

00:14.813 --> 00:16.696
That's funny.
She barely touched me.

00:16.902 --> 00:18.975
Uh, Gate 23. Come on.

00:18.985 --> 00:21.574
If we miss this flight,
I will never forgive myself.

00:22.040 --> 00:24.135
Why was this flight
so important?

00:24.168 --> 00:27.300
Let's back up a few months
to the fall of 2006.

00:27.613 --> 00:29.888
I had just sold my first
building design and become

00:29.895 --> 00:32.682
the youngest project manager
in my firm's history.

00:32.954 --> 00:34.912
Suddenly I was
being headhunted.

00:34.929 --> 00:38.493
One firm was even considering me to
run their entire New York office.

00:38.766 --> 00:40.640
They were flying me in
for a final interview

00:40.657 --> 00:42.700
at their corporate
headquarters in Chicago.

00:42.716 --> 00:44.652
It was the opportunity
of a lifetime.

00:44.665 --> 00:46.090
It was my destiny.

00:46.266 --> 00:47.831
There was just one problem.

00:47.848 --> 00:49.960
Hi, wait, two more.

00:49.977 --> 00:51.802
Sorry, you're too late,
I already shut the doors.

00:51.836 --> 00:54.061
Well, I'm sure if we pull
real hard we can open them.

00:54.075 --> 00:57.002
Hmm, I wish it worked like that, but
see, once I close those doors,
that's it.

00:57.035 --> 00:59.161
Nobody else is allowed
down that jet-way.

00:59.985 --> 01:01.330
Except for that guy.

01:02.686 --> 01:06.492
Please, if-if I miss this flight, I'll miss
the chance to interview for my dream job.

01:06.507 --> 01:07.620
I'm sorry, sir.

01:07.635 --> 01:09.833
His dream job!
Didn't you ever have a dream job?

01:09.848 --> 01:13.161
Something from when you were a little
girl, that was all you wanted to do?

01:13.176 --> 01:15.342
I mean, for God's sakes,
I'm sure you didn't go to bed at night

01:15.376 --> 01:16.942
dreaming about being a...

01:17.665 --> 01:19.311
I mean, uh...

01:19.696 --> 01:21.423
This is a cool job.

01:22.176 --> 01:24.223
Please, I have to
be on this flight.

01:24.236 --> 01:25.612
I'll see what I can do.

01:25.626 --> 01:27.012
But it doesn't look good.

01:27.098 --> 01:27.922
Thanks.

01:28.706 --> 01:30.762
Your uniforms are pretty.

01:57.457 --> 01:58.582
Okay.

01:58.596 --> 02:01.050
They haven't armed the doors yet,
so you still have a chance.

02:01.068 --> 02:03.421
It's up to the captain now
and they're calling us back.

02:03.438 --> 02:05.621
Great, please let us know
soon as you hear anything.

02:05.637 --> 02:07.860
Sure, and for the future,
we recommend you arrive

02:07.876 --> 02:10.479
at the airport an hour and
a half before your flight,

02:10.497 --> 02:12.431
not, you know,
one minute after.

02:12.445 --> 02:14.111
Normally, I'm
incredibly responsible.

02:14.126 --> 02:16.441
I just had to go to court this
morning and get sentenced.

02:16.917 --> 02:19.003
Not that I'm a
criminal or anything.

02:19.017 --> 02:21.030
Yeah, he just jumped
a subway turnstile.

02:21.045 --> 02:24.320
You seem to have a lot of problems
with the rules of travel.

02:26.085 --> 02:27.212
Hello?

02:29.616 --> 02:32.043
Oh, that is great news.

02:32.057 --> 02:34.142
It's my mom--
she found her missing earring.

02:34.166 --> 02:36.153
Have a seat.
I'll call you when I hear something.

02:36.166 --> 02:37.440
Where was it?

02:38.476 --> 02:40.053
That thing better
have call waiting.

02:40.065 --> 02:42.632
Could you just call the firm
and explain what happened?

02:42.646 --> 02:43.970
It's down to three people

02:43.986 --> 02:46.140
and I know they need to
make their decision today.

02:46.165 --> 02:49.531
I sort of feel my not showing up
might put me at a disadvantage.

02:50.706 --> 02:52.413
I'm so stupid.

02:52.428 --> 02:54.521
Why did I have to
jump that turnstile?

02:54.536 --> 02:57.221
Hey, don't be so
hard on yourself.

02:57.238 --> 03:00.103
And isn't this whole thing
really Barney's fault?

03:00.208 --> 03:01.570
She had a point.

03:01.587 --> 03:03.370
It was kind of Barney's fault.

03:03.388 --> 03:05.161
Let's back up a few months.

03:05.868 --> 03:07.773
Oh, Marshall,
how's the broken toe?

03:07.786 --> 03:09.372
Oh, man, it kills.

03:09.385 --> 03:10.973
You  want some aspirin, baby?

03:10.985 --> 03:13.091
You know I don't
believe in pain killers.

03:15.266 --> 03:17.463
Wow, your first broken bone.

03:17.478 --> 03:19.363
Kind of kills your whole
"Unbreakable" theory.

03:19.375 --> 03:22.070
Marshall used to think
he was indestructible.

03:22.087 --> 03:24.550
Well, it added up.
I've never broken anything.

03:24.568 --> 03:26.210
I've never been sick,
and when I need to,

03:26.226 --> 03:28.713
I can summon
incredible strength.

03:28.735 --> 03:31.492
Ted, tell her the story
of the really heavy door.

03:31.566 --> 03:33.363
There was a really heavy door.

03:33.375 --> 03:34.771
He opened it.

03:34.997 --> 03:36.951
On one pull.

03:38.616 --> 03:41.470
Well, you must be really bummed, you're
not gonna be able to run tomorrow.

03:41.508 --> 03:42.880
Yeah. It sucks,

03:42.898 --> 03:46.260
all that work I put in training
for the marathon was a total waste.

03:46.275 --> 03:48.200
Training for a marathon.

03:49.716 --> 03:50.693
What?

03:50.706 --> 03:53.531
You don't need to train for a marathon.
You just run it.

03:53.846 --> 03:55.322
You're kidding, right?

03:55.337 --> 03:58.092
Not at all. I could run a
marathon anytime I wanted to.

03:58.245 --> 04:01.043
So like tomorrow, you think you
could wake up, roll out of bed,

04:01.055 --> 04:02.820
and just run the New
York City Marathon?

04:02.837 --> 04:04.011
Absolutely.

04:04.028 --> 04:07.070
Barney, we're talking
about 42 kilometers.

04:07.088 --> 04:09.530
Thanks, Canada.
I'll take it from here.

04:09.547 --> 04:11.680
Barney, it's like 26 miles.

04:11.697 --> 04:13.523
Here's how you run a marathon.

04:13.538 --> 04:16.142
Step one, you start running.

04:16.867 --> 04:18.390
There is no step two.

04:18.875 --> 04:21.072
Okay, you know what? Prove it.

04:21.084 --> 04:23.071
Take my number and
run in my place.

04:23.087 --> 04:26.473
I will bet you 50 bucks you
don't even finish the race.

04:26.486 --> 04:27.822
50 bucks?

04:27.838 --> 04:29.713
Gee, Grandpa, if I win,

04:29.728 --> 04:32.261
maybe I can buy myself
an ice-cream cone.

04:32.987 --> 04:34.891
Make it $10,000.

04:34.905 --> 04:37.251
You have a gambling problem.
You'll bet me 50.

04:37.268 --> 04:38.731
Fine, then no bet.

04:38.747 --> 04:40.213
Okay, $50.

04:42.596 --> 04:44.983
The next morning,
as the marathon began,

04:44.997 --> 04:47.183
we were focused on
Marshall's computer.

04:47.197 --> 04:49.752
Each runner gets a tracking chip
so you can follow them online,

04:49.766 --> 04:52.761
see when they pass certain checkpoints.
Barney's got mine in his shoe.

04:53.328 --> 04:54.723
Ooh, he's starting!

04:54.888 --> 04:56.672
This ought to be good.

05:02.116 --> 05:03.082
Wow.

05:03.355 --> 05:06.203
He's already passing
the second checkpoint.

05:06.296 --> 05:08.611
This tracking thing is amazing.

05:08.626 --> 05:10.972
When we get married,
you're getting one of these.

05:16.955 --> 05:19.742
Wow. Look at his time.
It's pretty impressive.

05:19.758 --> 05:21.851
He's gotta be cheating, okay.

05:21.867 --> 05:23.071
He knew we'd check.

05:23.087 --> 05:24.690
Yeah, he'll do
anything to win a bet.

05:24.708 --> 05:28.151
Remember that time he bet me that Men
at Work sang "Hungry Like the Wolf,"

05:28.166 --> 05:30.763
and when he found out that they didn't,
he tried to hire them to?

05:30.826 --> 05:34.203
Well, it looks like, "Barney" should
be coming over the Queensboro Bridge

05:34.215 --> 05:37.453
and up First Avenue within 
the next hour or so. But...

05:37.467 --> 05:40.002
there is no way that
that's really him.

05:40.176 --> 05:41.481
It's really him.

05:49.007 --> 05:51.103
Hey! That's mine.

05:51.278 --> 05:53.212
Yeah, you'd better run!

05:56.297 --> 05:59.440
- What up, non-finishers?
- Wow.

05:59.458 --> 06:01.742
- Very impressive, Barney.
- Right?

06:01.758 --> 06:03.580
Yeah, my time would have been
like a half an hour better,

06:03.618 --> 06:06.571
but I met this total hottie on
Mile Seven. We took a quick detour

06:06.587 --> 06:09.143
and had our own mini
marathon behind a Nathan's.

06:09.157 --> 06:10.340
I  won.

06:10.925 --> 06:13.931
I'm not sure anyone in
that story is a winner.

06:15.207 --> 06:17.200
So where's my 50 bucks?

06:17.408 --> 06:18.492
All right.

06:19.488 --> 06:22.492
I got to admit,
you earned this.

06:23.778 --> 06:27.290
Huh? Can't believe they haven't
made a coin for this yet.

06:27.503 --> 06:29.298
Anyway, I'm heading home.

06:29.535 --> 06:31.242
Might go hit the gym.

06:31.804 --> 06:34.142
Oh, hey, just so you know,
uh, all marathon runners get

06:34.159 --> 06:35.871
to use the subway
for free today.

06:35.885 --> 06:39.243
Wow.  You know I really should
check out this "subway."

06:39.256 --> 06:40.610
Heard so much about it.

06:40.625 --> 06:42.993
Wow. Look at me. Slumming it.

06:43.378 --> 06:45.853
Maybe I'll make a
weekend out of it

06:45.866 --> 06:48.343
and I'll call my bridge
and tunnel girl tonight.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.443
You're dating a girl
from New Jersey?

06:50.456 --> 06:51.780
No.

06:55.398 --> 06:57.013
So Barney did it.

06:57.028 --> 06:58.471
He actually finished
the marathon.

06:58.697 --> 07:01.920
But a little while later...
I got an interesting phone call.

07:01.935 --> 07:03.633
- Hello?
- Ted, it's Barney.

07:03.645 --> 07:06.063
Listen to me, I need you to come
and pick me up on the subway.

07:06.095 --> 07:07.803
What, what are
you talking about?

07:07.815 --> 07:10.711
I was sitting here,
totally minding my own business.

07:17.038 --> 07:18.203
Finisher.

07:19.216 --> 07:21.332
Yeah, you know what I mean.

07:21.447 --> 07:23.332
86th street.

07:45.157 --> 07:47.183
My legs don't work.

07:47.198 --> 07:50.213
I've already ridden the
subway twice end to end.

07:50.228 --> 07:52.302
I've seen where
it turns around.

07:52.337 --> 07:55.791
Ted, you don't ever want to see
where the subway turns around.

07:57.068 --> 07:59.400
Barney's legs won't work.

07:59.418 --> 08:01.020
He's riding the subway
from end to end

08:01.037 --> 08:03.191
because he physically
can't get off the train.

08:03.207 --> 08:05.183
Best 50 bucks I ever spent.

08:05.416 --> 08:06.641
Listen to me, Ted.

08:06.655 --> 08:09.642
I'm going to lose you any second.
I'm on the fourth car of the six train

08:09.658 --> 08:11.963
heading south from Pelham
Bay Park in the Bronx.

08:11.976 --> 08:14.882
Meet me at the 86th Street station in,
like, half an hour?

08:14.896 --> 08:17.002
All right. I'll be right there.

08:17.015 --> 08:18.562
Stay where you are.

08:19.568 --> 08:21.421
Ted, Ted.

08:38.996 --> 08:42.789
Oh, come on. You're not even going
to give up your seat for him?

08:45.046 --> 08:46.942
I'm sorry. I can't.

08:46.957 --> 08:48.293
Douche.

09:04.215 --> 09:06.532
- Barney?!
- Ted!

09:09.976 --> 09:11.022
Hey!

09:13.837 --> 09:15.790
No...!

09:17.375 --> 09:19.680
See? If Barney never
tried to run the marathon,

09:19.695 --> 09:21.431
you never would have
jumped that turnstile,

09:21.448 --> 09:23.471
you wouldn't have had
that court date today,

09:23.487 --> 09:25.180
and we would have
made this flight.

09:25.345 --> 09:26.481
You're right.

09:26.496 --> 09:28.341
Everything can be
traced back to him.

09:29.167 --> 09:31.281
Like that rash we
all got at Christmas.

09:32.286 --> 09:34.012
All right,
I have to see what's going on.

09:35.137 --> 09:38.022
- So I was able to get you two seats.
- Really? That's great!

09:38.036 --> 09:40.891
No, no, not you. I'm talking to
my mom about Blue Man Group.

09:40.906 --> 09:42.300
Ma, can I call you back?

09:42.516 --> 09:44.390
Okay, what about our flight?
Can we get on?

09:44.408 --> 09:46.792
I'm still waiting for... Huh.

09:47.477 --> 09:49.062
Looks like your
flight left already.

09:49.076 --> 09:51.692
What? No, n-n-n-no, n-no.
I have to be in Chicago today.

09:51.706 --> 09:53.220
Well, he never even
called you back?

09:53.236 --> 09:55.822
Well, it's typical pilot.
They don't call you back at work

09:55.838 --> 09:57.922
and they don't call you back after
you spend two nights with them

09:57.957 --> 09:59.642
at a Radisson in Orlando.

10:04.786 --> 10:07.723
It turned out there was one other
flight that would just barely get me

10:07.736 --> 10:10.100
to Chicago on time
for my job interview,

10:10.125 --> 10:12.703
but it was all the way on the
other side of the airport.

10:12.925 --> 10:14.731
What was the name of
the airline again?

10:14.746 --> 10:16.591
I think it was something
like Flights R' Us.

10:16.606 --> 10:17.712
Was the "R" backwards?

10:17.728 --> 10:19.052
God, I hope not.

10:19.948 --> 10:22.482
- Geez.
- Stupid smart carts.

10:22.775 --> 10:24.720
More like dumb carts.

10:24.767 --> 10:27.133
If we miss this flight,
it's all Barney's fault.

10:27.646 --> 10:30.662
You know, Barney never would have
run the marathon in the first place

10:30.677 --> 10:32.970
- if Marshall hadn't broken his toe.
- Yeah, so?

10:33.266 --> 10:35.153
What, you think
this is my fault?

10:36.486 --> 10:40.630
For Marshall, the initial idea to run
the marathon came way back in April.

10:40.647 --> 10:42.672
My pants are starting
to feel a little tight.

10:42.776 --> 10:46.272
Oh, that's okay.
I love that cute little belly.

10:51.016 --> 10:52.972
I cannot allow this.

10:52.985 --> 10:54.170
What?

10:55.488 --> 10:59.481
I am going to run the
New York City Marathon.

11:09.455 --> 11:12.091
"It is important to load
up on carbohydrates

11:12.105 --> 11:15.053
two to four hours
before a big run.

11:15.066 --> 11:17.430
Try a breakfast of a bagel,
a banana,

11:17.446 --> 11:20.401
oatmeal, strawberries
and some orange juice."

11:20.418 --> 11:23.151
Here you go, Marshmallow.
Just like the book said.

11:23.167 --> 11:26.983
Yeah, but from now on, I'm eating
all of my breakfast runner-style.

11:26.996 --> 11:28.913
Liquids are digested faster.

11:28.926 --> 11:30.933
That way, no energy is wasted,

11:30.945 --> 11:33.591
and it's all about the run.

12:03.395 --> 12:07.731
"Don't forget to give yourself
plenty of positive reinforcement."

12:08.877 --> 12:10.873
This is gonna be
your best run yet.

12:12.118 --> 12:15.341
You're going to accomplish
all of your goals.

12:16.118 --> 12:18.833
You are a robot sent
from the future

12:18.847 --> 12:20.750
to win the marathon!

12:22.095 --> 12:24.900
You are... Marshall.

12:25.536 --> 12:28.692
You are... Marshall.

12:28.735 --> 12:32.900
You are Marshall! Yeah!

12:38.536 --> 12:42.150
"Chafing or blisters can
occur in a number of areas,

12:42.167 --> 12:45.781
including the feet, armpits,
or even the nipples.

12:45.797 --> 12:49.703
Try using some petroleum 
jelly on the affected areas."

13:09.418 --> 13:11.073
Oh, gosh!

13:26.215 --> 13:28.483
Dude, you are a
terrific runner.

13:29.067 --> 13:33.453
Tomorrow you're gonna run and
finish the New York City Marathon!

13:34.207 --> 13:35.493
You're the best.

13:36.367 --> 13:37.681
You look good.

13:39.086 --> 13:41.643
Nobody does it better than you.

13:41.657 --> 13:43.290
Marshall? Oh, my God!

13:44.935 --> 13:46.920
So, yes, it was your fault.

13:46.938 --> 13:49.202
I  mean, if you don't show up at the
apartment in the middle of the day,

13:49.236 --> 13:51.892
Marshall doesn't break his toe,
Barney doesn't run in his place,

13:51.908 --> 13:53.763
I don't jump the turnstile
and get a court date,

13:53.798 --> 13:56.022
and we make our flight
in plenty of time!

13:58.107 --> 14:00.901
And I don't fall down and bite
my tongue at the airport.

14:01.047 --> 14:02.693
That really wasn't my fault.

14:02.708 --> 14:05.251
I  wouldn't have walked in on
Marshall if it weren't for Lily.

14:05.266 --> 14:06.660
Hey, think about it.

14:07.406 --> 14:08.673
Hey, what's going on here?

14:08.686 --> 14:10.721
Oh, looks like they're
camping out for something.

14:10.735 --> 14:12.053
Yeah, but for what?

14:12.067 --> 14:14.292
I don't know. Usually there's a
Stormtrooper or Klingon in line

14:14.328 --> 14:16.023
to give you some indication.

14:16.505 --> 14:18.851
"Annual wedding dress blowout.

14:18.866 --> 14:22.021
Designer sample
dresses up to 90% off.

14:22.035 --> 14:24.091
Doors open tomorrow, 8:00 a.m."

14:24.105 --> 14:28.232
Oh, my God. Can you believe what some
nut bags will do to save a few bucks?

14:28.377 --> 14:30.391
We have to camp out.

14:30.428 --> 14:32.270
- Are you serious?
- You don't understand.

14:32.287 --> 14:34.691
This is an amazing sale.
I've heard about it before,

14:34.707 --> 14:36.693
but I never knew where it was.

14:36.705 --> 14:40.300
We'll have a wedding dress campout.
It'll be fun.

14:40.697 --> 14:42.570
I can't go.
I've got this thing.

14:42.586 --> 14:44.760
- What thing?
- A penis.

14:45.857 --> 14:48.670
- This is the place.
- Oh, wow.

14:48.685 --> 14:51.760
Badgley Mischka! Melissa Sweet!

14:51.776 --> 14:53.042
Vera Wang!

14:53.057 --> 14:57.123
Oh, Robin, do you have any idea
what you guys stumbled onto here?

14:57.158 --> 14:58.883
You said wang.

15:00.835 --> 15:05.291
Oh, this reminds me of the ticket
line to Lilith Fair, 1998.

15:05.308 --> 15:07.100
Only fewer mullets.

15:07.118 --> 15:11.892
You should feel good. You're only, like,
the tenth craziest bride in New York.

15:14.885 --> 15:16.832
Ooh, this is comfy.

15:16.848 --> 15:19.300
We might actually
be able to sleep.

15:20.497 --> 15:22.402
That's kind of annoying.

15:22.436 --> 15:26.672
Well, I'm sure somebody will be
out here to turn it off any minute.

15:39.206 --> 15:41.312
I don't think I can take this.

15:41.656 --> 15:43.770
Every time it turns off,
I think,

15:43.788 --> 15:46.771
oh, maybe it won't
turn on again,

15:47.038 --> 15:49.003
but then it does.

15:49.016 --> 15:50.531
Why does it, Robin?

15:50.545 --> 15:52.720
Why does it keep turning on?

15:52.737 --> 15:54.773
It's gonna be okay,
sweetie. Why...

15:54.787 --> 15:57.553
Why don't we make a
game out of it, okay?

15:57.567 --> 15:59.122
Why don't we sing along?

16:19.956 --> 16:21.851
If we get through this,

16:21.895 --> 16:25.332
I swear I'm gonna live
my life differently.

16:25.936 --> 16:29.640
I just want to tell my parents
I love them one more time.

16:30.995 --> 16:32.942
Morning, ladies.

16:34.168 --> 16:37.902
- It's him. It's the car guy!
- Get out of here!

16:47.058 --> 16:50.542
The next morning, Robin was too tired
to go all the way back to Brooklyn,

16:50.557 --> 16:51.870
so while I was at work,

16:51.886 --> 16:54.453
she went to crash at my
apartment for a couple hours,

16:54.936 --> 16:56.770
and that's when...

16:56.886 --> 16:59.251
Nobody does it better than you.

16:59.268 --> 17:00.910
Marshall?! Oh, my God!

17:02.478 --> 17:05.470
So if Lily hadn't dragged me
down to the wedding dress store,

17:05.486 --> 17:07.180
we would have made
the first flight.

17:07.234 --> 17:09.872
Oh, thank God.
The doors are still open. We made it.

17:10.018 --> 17:13.982
Hi. Please.
We really need to get on this flight.

17:14.096 --> 17:16.051
Oh, my God!

17:16.068 --> 17:18.482
You're that reporter
from Metro News 1.

17:18.494 --> 17:20.240
Yes, yes, I am.

17:20.255 --> 17:22.220
I can't believe
you recognized me.

17:22.234 --> 17:24.633
- You did that story on the giant pizzas?
- Would you check to see

17:24.665 --> 17:26.961
- if you have any more seats?
- One moment, sir.

17:27.518 --> 17:29.940
Were those pizzas real?
Come on, were they?

17:30.276 --> 17:32.180
- Robin...
- One second, Ted.

17:32.198 --> 17:34.263
Um, you know,
a lot of people ask me that.

17:34.278 --> 17:36.592
The truth is,
the pizzas were real.

17:36.606 --> 17:39.672
- Calzones. Trick photography.
- I knew it!

17:39.686 --> 17:42.670
God, it is so nice
to meet a fan!

17:42.976 --> 17:46.001
And I would be a fan of your
work if you could get us

17:46.017 --> 17:47.702
two seats on that next flight.

17:47.717 --> 17:52.563
Well, the, uh, flight attendants are
just finishing up their final
seat count.

17:52.658 --> 17:54.502
Let me see what I can find out.

17:54.515 --> 17:57.231
Would it help if I got on and gave an
impassioned speech about my destiny?

17:57.266 --> 17:58.773
I think it might hurt.

18:02.028 --> 18:04.193
This is such a nightmare.

18:05.108 --> 18:08.320
Okay, so we agree? This goes
back to Lily wanting to camp out

18:08.338 --> 18:09.630
for a wedding dress?

18:10.347 --> 18:11.431
No.

18:11.568 --> 18:13.450
Wait. It goes back further. 

18:13.466 --> 18:16.403
Remember why we were eating
hot dogs on the East Side?

18:26.487 --> 18:29.033
1939?!

18:29.508 --> 18:32.093
This penny's from 1939!

18:33.735 --> 18:36.883
A 67-year-old penny.

18:36.896 --> 18:39.811
Do you realize this penny was
minted during World War II?

18:39.825 --> 18:43.141
Oh, so was my grandfather,
but that doesn't make him interesting.

18:43.425 --> 18:45.952
Look, I know a little
something about coins,

18:45.966 --> 18:47.991
and  this baby is worth
something to a collector.

18:48.007 --> 18:50.143
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is!

18:50.156 --> 18:52.442
You know what?
I'm gonna take you out to dinner

18:52.458 --> 18:54.182
with the money I get
for this little guy.

18:54.198 --> 18:56.651
And that's exactly what I did.

18:56.706 --> 19:00.272
You're lucky there's still a place that
serves anything for a dollar fifty.

19:00.285 --> 19:03.343
Hey, that's 150 times
its original value.

19:03.378 --> 19:06.893
Actually, the meal
was only $1.49.

19:07.796 --> 19:09.412
1984.

19:09.428 --> 19:12.223
Hey, in 50 years,
we can get dinner again.

19:12.328 --> 19:13.782
How dare you.

19:14.327 --> 19:15.691
Hey, what's going on?

19:15.707 --> 19:17.380
I don't know. Looks like they're
camping out for something.

19:17.415 --> 19:18.881
Yeah, but for what?

19:19.678 --> 19:21.083
It was me.

19:21.225 --> 19:23.013
I started this.

19:23.078 --> 19:24.942
If I hadn't picked
up that penny,

19:24.958 --> 19:27.820
we wouldn't have gone to get hot
dogs all the way across town.

19:27.838 --> 19:30.281
And we wouldn't have seen
that wedding dress store,

19:30.295 --> 19:32.241
Lily wouldn't have wanted
to camp out there,

19:32.258 --> 19:35.462
and I wouldn't have needed a nap
at your apartment the next day.

19:35.478 --> 19:37.720
Marshall wouldn't
have broken his toe.

19:37.757 --> 19:39.881
Barney wouldn't have
run the marathon.

19:39.897 --> 19:41.901
I wouldn't have jumped
that turnstile,

19:41.918 --> 19:44.420
gotten arrested,
had that court date...

19:44.507 --> 19:46.500
And we would have
made our flight.

19:47.157 --> 19:49.181
I don't think we can go
back any further than that

19:49.195 --> 19:50.931
unless you know who
dropped the penny.

19:50.945 --> 19:52.363
I wish I did.

19:52.376 --> 19:54.263
Though that person's already
been punished enough,

19:54.295 --> 19:56.962
losing a sweet penny like that.

19:57.285 --> 19:58.841
Uh, sir?

19:58.946 --> 20:01.551
Oh, please tell me you
have some good news.

20:01.567 --> 20:03.361
Uh, I'm afraid not.

20:03.376 --> 20:05.432
There are no extra
seats on the plane.

20:05.445 --> 20:06.730
I'm sorry.

20:06.748 --> 20:08.600
All, right, well,
thanks for trying.

20:09.368 --> 20:10.622
I can't believe this.

20:10.635 --> 20:13.411
That's it, it's over.

20:13.427 --> 20:14.930
Ted, come on.

20:14.945 --> 20:18.323
Your destiny just wasn't to
make it to Chicago today.

20:18.338 --> 20:21.270
Anyway, if that firm really wants you,
they'll reschedule.

20:21.626 --> 20:23.143
But that's not what happened.

20:23.158 --> 20:24.953
They didn't reschedule.

20:24.965 --> 20:26.833
They hired someone else.

20:26.846 --> 20:29.380
And as it turned out,
three months later,

20:29.397 --> 20:32.670
that guy ended up having
to relocate to Chicago.

20:32.928 --> 20:35.061
Kids, funny thing
about destiny--

20:35.077 --> 20:37.540
I thought I was destined
to get that job.

20:37.558 --> 20:38.870
But I was wrong.

20:38.888 --> 20:41.450
My destiny was to
stay in New York.

20:41.785 --> 20:43.712
Because if I hadn't,

20:43.725 --> 20:45.872
I never would have
met your mother.

21:12.706 --> 21:16.823
