00:04.560 --> 00:07.358
<i>Being the new doctor</i>
<i>at a hospital can be difficult.</i>

00:07.440 --> 00:10.989
<i>That's why it's nice when someone</i>
<i>takes the time to befriend you.</i>

00:11.080 --> 00:12.718
I'm Ron. I'm a new doctor here.

00:12.800 --> 00:15.189
Yeah, Ron. The "I don't
care ward" is down there.

00:15.280 --> 00:18.829
<i>Anyway, the person</i>
<i>who reached out to Molly was Elliot.</i>

00:18.920 --> 00:22.117
Do you wanna go to Little Tokyo
and do karaoke with me tonight?

00:22.200 --> 00:25.192
Do people with trichotillomania
pull their hair out?

00:26.360 --> 00:27.952
- Do they?
- Yeah.

00:28.040 --> 00:30.998
Cool. Cos inviting you to karaoke's
kind of a big deal to me.

00:31.080 --> 00:32.798
I'm a little shy about my 'aoke.

00:32.880 --> 00:34.916
You have nothing
to be embarrassed about.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.831
I don't know.
I'm pretty tone-deaf.

00:36.920 --> 00:39.434
I do these kick moves
that I don't think people get.

00:39.520 --> 00:43.433
Plus I sometimes wear a cape.
It's probably all in my head.

00:43.520 --> 00:44.873
<i>It's not.</i>

00:44.960 --> 00:46.871
Dr Cox,
can I ask you something?

00:46.960 --> 00:50.032
The answer is "Yes, it was me
who saw you doing leg lifts in the gym

00:50.120 --> 00:53.237
on that inflatable ball." It was
quite the display of girl power.

00:53.320 --> 00:55.038
Absolutely loved the leg warmers.

00:55.120 --> 00:56.917
First, they were just big socks, OK?

00:57.000 --> 01:00.072
Secondly, if you need to do laundry,
here's the washboard.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.515
- What do you want?
- As co-chief resident,

01:02.600 --> 01:05.352
I've noticed some of my residents
are overwhelmed.

01:05.440 --> 01:08.591
It'd be nice if you gave 'em
one of your patented pep talks.

01:08.680 --> 01:12.434
I'll be more than glad to give
your residents a little pep talk.

01:12.520 --> 01:15.796
Each and every one of you
is going to kill a patient.

01:15.880 --> 01:19.316
At some point during your residency,
you will screw up, they will die

01:19.400 --> 01:22.278
and it will be burned
into your conscience forever.

01:22.360 --> 01:24.874
- Hell, take pee pants here.
- Pee pants.

01:24.960 --> 01:27.952
He might go ahead and get himself
a clean kill this morning,

01:28.040 --> 01:30.998
seeing as his patient,
Miss Sampson, is in DKA

01:31.080 --> 01:33.548
and he hasn't been
tracking her phosphate level.

01:33.640 --> 01:35.676
Her phosphate level.

01:35.760 --> 01:38.194
Doug! Stop writing and go!

01:38.280 --> 01:40.316
That man
has killed so many patients,

01:40.400 --> 01:43.392
I'm starting to think he might be
a government operative.

01:43.480 --> 01:45.755
The point is,
the harder you study,

01:45.840 --> 01:49.276
the longer you just might be able
to hold off that first kill.

01:49.360 --> 01:51.635
Other than that,
I guess, cross your fingers

01:51.720 --> 01:55.554
and hope that the guy you murder
is a jackass with no family.

01:55.640 --> 01:58.950
Great to see you kids.
All the best.

01:59.040 --> 02:01.235
Thank you.
Thank you, Dr Cox.

02:01.320 --> 02:03.709
OK, you guys, pizza and punch
in the penthouse.

02:04.920 --> 02:07.229
Doug!

02:07.320 --> 02:09.038
Wrong patient.
One bed over.

02:11.520 --> 02:13.351
Hey, there.

02:13.440 --> 02:16.159
This is, like, my eleventh slice.

02:16.240 --> 02:18.231
Cannonball this.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.191
That's the good stuff.

02:21.280 --> 02:24.556
So anyway, after Dr Cox scared them,
no one wanted pizza or punch,

02:24.640 --> 02:27.313
except for Doug, who had
worked up a hearty appetite

02:27.400 --> 02:29.960
neglecting Miss Sampson
into a coma.

02:33.160 --> 02:35.993
Turk, what is Rowdy
doing in my closet?

02:36.080 --> 02:39.356
- He's guardin' your shoes.
- He almost gave me a heart attack.

02:39.440 --> 02:40.953
Could you do me a favour

02:41.040 --> 02:44.157
and not hold him by the haunches?
Yeah, he has hip dysplasia.

02:44.240 --> 02:46.151
He's a purebred.
It's genetic.

02:48.760 --> 02:51.911
I am sick of that creepy thing.
I want him out of my house.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.470
Isn't that a shocker? You don't care
about something important to me.

02:55.560 --> 02:57.357
Why don't you throw him out?

02:57.440 --> 03:00.079
Don't listen to him.
He's drunk on cheese.

03:00.160 --> 03:02.754
Don't think Rowdy
doesn't know what's going on.

03:02.840 --> 03:04.034
What's he gonna do?

03:12.280 --> 03:15.795
Easy, boy.
She ain't worth it.

03:30.560 --> 03:34.519
Mrs Carter, your fever was just
a reaction to the aesthetic we gave you

03:34.600 --> 03:36.318
during your cataract surgery.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.789
- I'm sending you home.
- Can I drive my Trans Am?

03:38.880 --> 03:41.314
That's not up to me.
That's up to the police

03:41.400 --> 03:43.709
and the owner
of those horses you killed.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.119
They were everywhere.

03:45.200 --> 03:48.431
You were on a racetrack, Mrs Carter.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.829
I don't get why Turk
was so upset about Rowdy.

03:50.920 --> 03:53.593
He's just a creepy, stuffed,
stupid, yellow, dead dog.

03:54.480 --> 03:57.711
- Too many adjectives?
- I'm sure he's more than a pet to Turk.

03:57.800 --> 04:00.189
I mean, he's basically
a link to his childhood.

04:00.280 --> 04:02.475
He bought him eight years ago
at a garage sale.

04:02.560 --> 04:04.391
Then he's just a Nutter Butter.

04:04.480 --> 04:07.438
Still, I think
I really hurt his feelings.

04:07.520 --> 04:10.876
Maybe you should do something nice
for Rowdy, like get him cleaned.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.793
Your sign doesn't say
"live dog groomer."

04:21.880 --> 04:25.236
<i>As doctors, we always</i>
<i>take patients' histories,</i>

04:25.320 --> 04:27.311
<i>though there aren't a lot of surprises.</i>

04:27.400 --> 04:29.550
And, Mr Phillips, do you exercise?

04:29.640 --> 04:32.108
- I do yoga every morning.
- I can't do yoga.

04:32.200 --> 04:34.634
All that deep breathing.
I hate breathing.

04:34.720 --> 04:37.917
Except, you know, to live.
Do you drink?

04:38.000 --> 04:41.754
- Occasional glass of wine with dinner.
- And any drug use?

04:41.840 --> 04:43.990
Been on and off heroin
for eight years.

04:44.080 --> 04:46.116
But I've been clean
for six months.

04:46.200 --> 04:48.270
- See? No track marks.
- Way to go, Daddy.

04:48.360 --> 04:50.476
He's my biggest fan.

04:54.280 --> 04:57.317
- Do you smoke cigarettes?
- No way.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.960
Of course not.
Those things'll kill ya.

05:01.480 --> 05:04.153
Mr Daniels, some fluid
has gathered near your heart.

05:04.240 --> 05:07.550
I'm gonna schedule a pericardiocentesis
and drain it with a needle.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.710
Someone's gonna stick
a needle in my chest?

05:09.800 --> 05:13.509
- Not just someone. Dr Da Man.
- Who's Dr Da Man?

05:13.600 --> 05:15.795
Say it without the doctor.

05:15.880 --> 05:18.348
- Who's Mr Da Man?
- No, just say the last name.

05:18.440 --> 05:20.590
- Who's Da Man?
- I'm da man!

05:20.680 --> 05:24.195
That was awesome.
That was fun doing that with you.

05:24.280 --> 05:26.953
<i>Now that you've got</i>
<i>his confidence, drive it home.</i>

05:27.040 --> 05:28.951
So I'll schedule the procedure.

05:29.040 --> 05:32.237
- If you think it's the right thing.
- I do. Dr Cox!

05:32.320 --> 05:35.710
Thanks for that "everyone's
a murderer" speech. Nice scare tactic.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.677
My residents have stopped eating.

05:37.760 --> 05:41.799
That wasn't a scare tactic. Eventually,
everyone commits a sin of omission

05:41.880 --> 05:44.997
or doesn't act quickly enough,
and somebody kicks the bucket.

05:45.080 --> 05:48.277
It's really not a question of "if".
It's a question of "when".

05:48.360 --> 05:52.353
<i>It's strange. Even though a lot</i>
<i>of patients have died under my care,</i>

05:52.440 --> 05:54.635
<i>I don't think I've killed any of them.</i>

06:00.200 --> 06:03.272
- Heaven's a diner?
- Get anything you want, dear.

06:03.360 --> 06:06.033
- Maybe I'll have flapjacks.
- They don't have those.

06:06.120 --> 06:09.590
No flapjacks in heaven?
Are flapjacks evil?

06:09.680 --> 06:12.148
Don't worry about it.
Listen, dead people,

06:12.240 --> 06:16.153
do any of you feel that I may have,
you know, killed you?

06:16.240 --> 06:17.798
No.

06:17.880 --> 06:19.632
I mean, you weren't a great doctor.

06:19.720 --> 06:22.280
- He was nervous.
- Oh, like a little bird.

06:22.360 --> 06:24.669
But no, dear,
you didn't kill any of us.

06:27.520 --> 06:31.911
You know what?
I left my wallet back on Earth.

06:33.200 --> 06:34.997
Suckers.

06:37.760 --> 06:39.830
Heard you're tryin' to clean a dead dog.

06:39.920 --> 06:42.718
- Yeah? Who told you that?
- The wind.

06:42.800 --> 06:44.631
Blonde doctor.

06:44.720 --> 06:47.518
- I can clean it for you.
- Why would you do that?

06:47.600 --> 06:51.275
I don't know. I'm still
a little drunk from breakfast.

06:51.360 --> 06:55.035
Plus, taxidermy used to be
kinda a hobby of mine, you know,

06:55.120 --> 06:56.917
till the state took my license away.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.592
How come?

06:58.680 --> 07:01.956
What happened to all the
cute little squirrels, Flo?

07:04.480 --> 07:06.277
Let's call this meeting to order.

07:06.360 --> 07:10.990
First things first, I counted
the ballots and someone voted twice.

07:11.080 --> 07:13.753
Interesting.
I'm not pointing fingers. Roy.

07:13.840 --> 07:15.990
There were never any squirrels.

07:17.680 --> 07:21.912
I've got this patient with a damaged
heart valve and needs a replacement.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.558
He a good candidate for surgery?

07:23.640 --> 07:27.792
Definitely. Thirty-five, married,
good job, cute little boy, great dog.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.836
Can't remember
what kind they said.

07:29.920 --> 07:33.230
Long time recovering heroin addict.
Bulldog. That's what it was.

07:33.320 --> 07:36.357
Named Paris after the city,
not the slutty socialite tramp.

07:36.440 --> 07:37.759
He's a heroin addict?

07:37.840 --> 07:41.389
But he's super-serious about his
sobriety. He's been to rehab six times.

07:41.480 --> 07:44.040
He needs to dial it up
to super-duper-serious.

07:44.120 --> 07:47.032
- I'll tell him.
- Elliot, you know the chief of surgery

07:47.120 --> 07:49.680
isn't gonna accept the risk
of a valve replacement

07:49.760 --> 07:52.558
on someone
who's gonna destroy it with drugs.

07:58.160 --> 08:02.358
- Want some of my pancakes?
- Devil cakes? No, thank you.

08:02.440 --> 08:06.991
Dr Cox is trying to convince me that
everyone eventually kills a patient.

08:07.080 --> 08:10.197
- But I haven't. I know you haven't.
- Hell, yeah, I have.

08:10.280 --> 08:12.475
Remember my first year, Mr Quinn?

08:12.560 --> 08:14.994
I forgot to write the order
for his albumin drip

08:15.080 --> 08:17.469
and he haemorrhaged and died.

08:18.400 --> 08:19.594
You want your doughnut?

08:19.680 --> 08:22.069
<i>And it turned out</i>
<i>Turk wasn't the only one.</i>

08:24.440 --> 08:27.273
Mrs Kahn, my second year.

08:27.360 --> 08:31.035
Mrs Studebaker,
40 minutes into my first day.

08:31.120 --> 08:34.236
I've been a doctor for 30 years.
What do you think?

08:34.320 --> 08:36.754
On my third day,
there was Mr Kershnar.

08:36.840 --> 08:41.549
Jenny Roth about eight weeks ago.
It was really tough because she was hot.

08:41.640 --> 08:44.632
Then later that third day...

08:44.720 --> 08:47.075
Oh, boy. That can't be good.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.276
No, Newbie, I have not killed.

08:49.360 --> 08:52.796
But I happen to be, as always,
the exception that proves the rule.

08:52.880 --> 08:55.348
So right about now,
you gotta be asking yourself,

08:55.440 --> 08:58.716
do you think you're that good?

09:01.000 --> 09:02.797
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna kill someone.

09:04.600 --> 09:08.275
Because of heroin use, Surgery doesn't
wanna give Mr Phillips a heart valve.

09:08.360 --> 09:11.636
Now an ethics committee is gonna
decide if he gets the operation.

09:11.720 --> 09:15.349
I'm freakin' out, I've gotta argue
his case. My God. Is it already 2.00?

09:15.440 --> 09:16.839
That's Greenland time.

09:16.920 --> 09:20.310
So I remember to call my mom on her
vacation before she goes on the boat.

09:20.400 --> 09:21.389
The boat?

09:21.480 --> 09:24.472
She's been sleeping
with a commercial salmon fisherman.

09:24.560 --> 09:25.913
How fun for her.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.958
I've dealt with ethics committees.
You're gonna be great.

09:29.040 --> 09:31.873
- The key is to be confident.
- Well, I'm not.

09:31.960 --> 09:34.838
I'll tell you what.
I'll go with you for moral support.

09:34.920 --> 09:37.673
If things get dicey
cos it's a bunch of stuffed shirts,

09:37.760 --> 09:40.479
then we can make out.
They'll give you what you want.

09:41.360 --> 09:43.669
What? I thought I heard something.

09:43.760 --> 09:45.079
Goodbye, Todd.

09:45.160 --> 09:48.232
Back to the transplant.

09:48.320 --> 09:50.754
So who's even on an ethics committee?

09:50.840 --> 09:52.558
Obviously higher-ups.

09:52.640 --> 09:55.632
The chief of medicine,

09:55.720 --> 09:58.188
a sharp legal mind

09:58.280 --> 10:01.352
and an older doctor
with a wealth of experience.

10:01.440 --> 10:04.159
If Edwards is dead,
I want his cupcake.

10:05.440 --> 10:06.475
Not yet.

10:14.560 --> 10:18.269
<i>As I was contemplating how easy it</i>
<i>would be to make my first fatal mistake,</i>

10:18.360 --> 10:21.272
<i>I had a feeling Mr Daniels</i>
<i>felt good about this procedure.</i>

10:21.360 --> 10:22.588
I feel good about this.

10:22.680 --> 10:27.071
<i>See? We all end up leaning on certain</i>
<i>clichés when making major decisions.</i>

10:27.160 --> 10:31.233
<i>Like "Don't jump off a bridge if you</i>
<i>don't know how deep the water is. "</i>

10:31.320 --> 10:33.880
This procedure's too risky now.
We should wait.

10:35.280 --> 10:36.759
<i>And of course, the classic:</i>

10:36.840 --> 10:39.434
<i>"No matter how clean</i>
<i>the janitor gets your dead dog,</i>

10:39.520 --> 10:43.433
<i>you need to put him in the trunk</i>
<i>and not leave him on the roof. "</i>

10:47.360 --> 10:48.918
<i>And the lesser known,</i>

10:49.000 --> 10:51.878
<i>"You can accomplish anything</i>
<i>with a friend by your side. "</i>

10:51.960 --> 10:54.394
I understand that
because of his drug problem

10:54.480 --> 10:57.472
you don't think Mr Phillips
is a good candidate for surgery,

10:57.560 --> 11:00.791
but he understands that
this heart valve is a responsibility.

11:00.880 --> 11:04.429
Those of you who have met him,
like Ted, can attest to this.

11:04.520 --> 11:07.432
This is a very dicey case.
Ted, what do you think?

11:07.520 --> 11:09.556
She knows my name.
Whatever she wants.

11:09.640 --> 11:11.835
Very ethical.
Why don't I open the floor

11:11.920 --> 11:14.480
to those people who currently
do not have erections?

11:14.560 --> 11:16.437
Dr Clock. Think this guy'll stay clean?

11:16.520 --> 11:19.273
I'm here as a friend.
I think you should ask Ted again.

11:19.360 --> 11:23.558
Oh, good God,
she knows it too. Am I awake?

11:23.640 --> 11:26.313
Dr Clock,
Edwards here is, at best,

11:26.400 --> 11:28.960
a few minutes away
from walking towards the light.

11:29.040 --> 11:33.158
So, what say you stop wasting our time
and give me your professional opinion?

11:33.240 --> 11:36.710
<i>Of course, sometimes,</i>
<i>friends will surprise you.</i>

11:36.800 --> 11:38.916
Mr Phillips' numerous relapses

11:39.000 --> 11:42.310
paint the picture of someone
who has not overcome his addiction.

11:42.400 --> 11:44.960
So no, I don't think he will.

11:45.040 --> 11:47.031
Karaoke's so off.

11:50.720 --> 11:52.073
Look, I know you're mad.

11:52.160 --> 11:54.628
Why? Because you
betrayed me? Betrayer.

11:54.720 --> 11:57.632
They asked for my professional opinion,
I had to give it.

11:57.720 --> 12:00.917
If you were a real friend,
you could've lied, made out with me.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.479
Stuff we talked about.

12:02.560 --> 12:04.471
- Did I just hear?
- Todd!

12:06.120 --> 12:07.155
I wanna work this out.

12:07.240 --> 12:10.312
I have to see this schizophrenic
patient. It's already 6.00.

12:10.400 --> 12:14.154
No, Molly, it's 3.00. You're
still on stupid Greenland time.

12:14.240 --> 12:17.073
Shoot. I forgot to call
my mom and Yergi.

12:18.720 --> 12:20.551
<i>I know I bailed on Mr Daniels,</i>

12:20.640 --> 12:23.438
<i>but the whole having not</i>
<i>killed thing got in my head.</i>

12:23.520 --> 12:25.954
- <i>Still, no one will notice.</i>
- Ah, Kiki Dee.

12:26.040 --> 12:29.919
I heard Mr Daniels isn't getting
his pericardiocentesis. Since when?

12:30.000 --> 12:31.991
<i>You're gonna lie.</i>
<i>Don't be specific.</i>

12:32.080 --> 12:34.878
1.42 yesterday afternoon.
His wife didn't want him to.

12:34.960 --> 12:37.235
She's beautiful.
One green eye, one blue.

12:37.320 --> 12:41.074
They're both from Luxembourg.
I believe they're Luxembourgian.

12:41.160 --> 12:43.469
Where in Luxembourg?
I spent two weeks there.

12:43.560 --> 12:45.676
<i>What are the odds?</i>
<i>Stay vague.</i>

12:45.760 --> 12:48.274
Outside Mertert
near the German border.

12:48.360 --> 12:52.194
They say what they miss most are lazy
summer afternoons on the Moselle River.

12:52.280 --> 12:54.953
<i>You are channelling</i>
<i>that seventh grade book report.</i>

12:55.040 --> 12:56.109
OK, then.

12:56.200 --> 12:58.395
<i>Bullet dodged.</i>
<i>He totally bought it.</i>

12:58.480 --> 12:59.708
<i>Where's he taking me?</i>

12:59.800 --> 13:04.396
Mr Daniels, we have rethought things and
decided you should have that procedure.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.072
OK.

13:06.160 --> 13:09.994
That took quite a bit of cajoling,
but I think I was able to convince him.

13:10.080 --> 13:13.516
<i>That's OK. Cos I wasn't</i>
<i>the only one lying around here.</i>

13:13.600 --> 13:17.195
Hey, baby, I'm gonna head home
and watch some television with Rowdy.

13:17.280 --> 13:20.511
Rowdy? No!
You shouldn't go home.

13:20.600 --> 13:23.160
- Why?
- I need you to go somewhere for me.

13:24.360 --> 13:27.397
I want you to go to a strip club.

13:27.480 --> 13:29.471
OK.

13:29.560 --> 13:31.437
Turk, can I talk to you for a second?

13:31.520 --> 13:33.795
Can't talk now.
Good stuff's happenin'.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.758
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Don't care.

13:36.840 --> 13:40.469
Where? Where am I gonna find
a dead, stuffed yellow lab?

13:40.560 --> 13:43.791
- I can help.
- No, you have work to do.

13:46.400 --> 13:47.435
Let's go.

13:52.360 --> 13:54.920
- No!
- OK.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.150
I just needed to know
where the line was.

14:02.400 --> 14:03.549
Well, hello.

14:04.840 --> 14:07.673
Wrong place, wrong time, little buddy.

14:11.920 --> 14:16.198
Fellas, I'd like you all to meet Kyle.

14:16.280 --> 14:18.236
Welcome him.
Treat him as a brother.

14:18.320 --> 14:21.869
You'll enjoy it here.
Any complaints, go to Dwayne.

14:21.960 --> 14:25.999
What do we got on the table?
Greg, may I run the meeting?

14:26.080 --> 14:27.957
Is that cool? OK.

14:28.040 --> 14:32.192
Well, I guess I was
a little more persuasive than I thought.

14:32.280 --> 14:33.554
You got the heart valve!

14:33.640 --> 14:36.393
Oh, that's amazing.
We have to celebrate.

14:37.360 --> 14:40.352
- How do you celebrate without heroin?
- With cake, mostly.

14:40.440 --> 14:41.759
Let's score some cake.

14:41.840 --> 14:45.628
Mr Phillips, part of the deal is you'll
come back the next six weeks for rehab.

14:45.720 --> 14:48.553
Absolutely. Not a problem.
I'm real good at rehab.

14:49.600 --> 14:52.239
But after that, I'm gonna
move my family to Florida.

14:52.320 --> 14:54.356
- Start fresh.
- Yeah.

14:54.440 --> 14:57.989
Did somebody page me? I'm sorry
I took so long. I was just eating lunch.

14:58.080 --> 15:00.036
Of course.
It's 8.30 in the morning.

15:00.120 --> 15:03.112
I wanted to let you know that
the committee voted in my favour.

15:03.200 --> 15:05.236
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

15:05.320 --> 15:07.754
- I was congratulating Dean.
- Why?

15:07.840 --> 15:10.638
- He got a new heart valve.
- She voted against you.

15:10.720 --> 15:12.711
Can I talk to you outside?

15:13.960 --> 15:16.474
Did you just page me
so you could rub my face in this?

15:16.560 --> 15:19.677
Yes. There's also a couple
of messages on your home machine.

15:19.760 --> 15:23.548
I hope I'm wrong, and I hope he stays
clean. Let's not make this personal.

15:23.640 --> 15:26.074
Said the loser who lost.

15:26.160 --> 15:28.674
Don't push me. One of the reasons
I became a therapist

15:28.760 --> 15:31.752
is I've been able to zero in
on a person's greatest insecurity.

15:31.840 --> 15:34.149
I'm real scared, Molly.
Whatcha gonna do?

15:34.240 --> 15:35.275
Eyebrows.

15:37.680 --> 15:40.353
Eyebrows? Like
that's gonna make you...

15:42.520 --> 15:45.034
Elliot, come on.
You can't be that insecure.

15:45.120 --> 15:47.429
Giant Adam's apple.

15:50.280 --> 15:51.315
I have to go.

15:51.400 --> 15:55.871
<i>Elliot's comment didn't bother me cos</i>
<i>I'm proud of the body God gave me.</i>

15:55.960 --> 15:59.270
<i>Besides, I had bigger problems.</i>
<i>I had to do Mr Daniels'procedure.</i>

15:59.360 --> 16:03.273
<i>Luckily, I'm a professional,</i>
<i>and professionals finish the job.</i>

16:03.360 --> 16:07.433
This needle is too sticky.
I'm out. Get it together, Laverne.

16:08.840 --> 16:12.310
Hey, Peggy. Yes, I noticed
the turtleneck choice in August

16:12.400 --> 16:14.436
and can only assume
it's something to do

16:14.520 --> 16:16.909
with that grapefruit
you store in your trachea.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.310
Let me put your mind at ease.
You've killed before.

16:20.400 --> 16:21.753
Who?

16:21.840 --> 16:23.558
Do you remember Mrs Carter?

16:25.360 --> 16:27.351
OK, bye-bye.

16:29.960 --> 16:33.077
- She died?
- Three days ago of endocarditis.

16:33.160 --> 16:37.278
You didn't get blood cultures
and you missed it. You happy?

16:37.360 --> 16:40.193
<i>The weird thing was</i>
<i>that I was a little happy.</i>

16:40.280 --> 16:43.477
- Sticky needle, please.
- Here you go, Doctor.

16:43.560 --> 16:47.109
By the way, when this is over,
I'm kickin' your arse.

16:50.280 --> 16:52.157
Where's your husband?

16:57.480 --> 16:58.754
He isn't here.

17:00.160 --> 17:01.149
Ruff ruff.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.310
You found Rowdy?

17:04.400 --> 17:06.391
No, not Rowdy.
This is Steven.

17:06.480 --> 17:10.758
Rowdy was 48 inches from snout to tail.
Steven's only 46 on a good day.

17:10.839 --> 17:12.955
I think we're OK.

17:13.040 --> 17:15.713
I got him off another taxidermy guy
on the Internet.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.915
Had to trade him my squirrel army.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.594
Oh, I'm sorry you had
to do that. But thank you.

17:20.680 --> 17:23.672
Nah, everyone thinks
squirrel armies are so great.

17:23.760 --> 17:26.319
I'm not sure
it's the healthiest habit in the world.

17:26.400 --> 17:29.153
Thank you.

17:29.240 --> 17:30.912
He likes the park.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.116
Let it go. OK.

17:36.600 --> 17:38.989
It smells like Rowdy.

17:39.080 --> 17:40.672
He's Steven.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.878
<i>Killing Mrs Carter,</i>
<i>though admittedly bad for her,</i>

17:44.960 --> 17:47.190
<i>was just the pick-me-up I needed.</i>

17:47.280 --> 17:49.953
I don't know how my car
ended up in the community pool.

17:50.040 --> 17:53.999
You must have lost control
after you went through the snack bar.

17:54.080 --> 17:55.752
<i>Mrs Carter?</i>

17:57.320 --> 18:00.517
Did I trick Newbie?
I did, didn't I?

18:00.600 --> 18:03.956
And now, of course, he has
to live in fear of when he will kill.

18:04.040 --> 18:05.314
When, when, when, when?

18:05.400 --> 18:08.278
- I don't appreciate lying.
- I know you're scared,

18:08.360 --> 18:11.477
and a lot of times you feel
like a little girl in a big gal's body.

18:11.560 --> 18:15.439
But here's the dirty little secret:
Fear is good.

18:15.520 --> 18:18.034
It keeps you
from becoming a crappy doctor.

18:18.120 --> 18:20.315
The trick is,
you can't let it paralyse you.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.710
Don't worry about a thing, Newbie.
You're a sure thing to get a kill.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.836
In fact, should be any day now.

18:25.920 --> 18:30.391
<i>One of the hardest things is sometimes</i>
<i>you don't get to know how things end.</i>

18:36.280 --> 18:39.317
- What are you doin'?
- Just waitin' for Mr Phillips.

18:40.960 --> 18:43.030
He showed up
for the first couple days.

18:43.120 --> 18:46.999
But he's missed his last
three rehab appointments.

18:47.080 --> 18:49.150
I'll wait with you.

18:49.240 --> 18:50.912
Thanks.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.672
I got my eyebrows waxed.

18:52.760 --> 18:54.830
They look really good.

18:57.480 --> 19:00.392
<i>Whether it's wondering</i>
<i>if your husband will realise</i>

19:00.480 --> 19:04.951
<i>you replaced his dead dog</i>
<i>with a shorter replica...</i>

19:05.040 --> 19:09.033
<i>... or wondering when and if</i>
<i>you're gonna kill that first person.</i>

19:09.120 --> 19:10.678
Everybody, watch closely.

19:10.760 --> 19:14.309
Because if you're not careful,
you can cause a pneumothorax.

19:16.880 --> 19:18.950
<i>Ultimately,</i>
<i>it'll drive you crazy</i>

19:19.040 --> 19:21.918
<i>if you don't have a friend</i>
<i>to help you through it.</i>

19:22.000 --> 19:25.310
He might've gone to Florida.
Maybe he's going to a hospital there.

19:25.400 --> 19:27.868
- Do you think?
- I don't know. Maybe.

19:50.240 --> 19:52.435
OK, there is no way
I'm following that guy.

19:52.520 --> 19:54.511
I don't even have my cape.
