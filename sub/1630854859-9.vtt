trade myself for answers.

15:06.890 --> 15:08.520
And when she's close enough
to give them,

15:08.720 --> 15:12.390
I'll show her exactly who
and what I am.

15:12.590 --> 15:14.960
Jack, don't do this.

15:15.160 --> 15:16.920
You're gonna get yourself

I gave Wesley space,

All Borg undergo
genetic alterations

18:53.380 --> 18:54.750
so that their bodies can
communicate

18:54.950 --> 18:56.570
with their cybernetic
components.

18:56.770 --> 18:59.140
As it turns out, yours were just
a little more extensive

18:59.340 --> 19:01.060
than we thought.

19:01.260 --> 19:05.840
New genetic code was actually
written and stored inside you.

19:06.040 --> 19:09.240
Something we were never able
to detect 35 years ago.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.630
So the anomaly Dr. Soong
discovered

19:11.830 --> 19:13.720
during the captain's transition
into synthetic form

19:13.920 --> 19:17.990
was in fact dormant
biological Borg adaptations.

19:18.190 --> 19:19.990
They never truly let you go.

19:20.190 --> 19:22.690
It is why Vadic stole your body
from Daystrom.

19:22.890 --> 19:26.650
The Changelings extracted that
altered portion of your DNA.

19:26.850 --> 19:29.130
Jean-Luc as Locutus was
a kind of receiver?

19:29.330 --> 19:30.780
That's why I could
still hear them

19:30.980 --> 19:32.520
after I was assimilated.

19:32.720 --> 19:35.740
Your body could still hear
the voice of the Collective.

19:35.940 --> 19:37.880
So how is Jack different?

19:38.080 --> 19:42.790
Your son appears to be
a transmitter,

19:42.990 --> 19:46.230
able to send instructions.

19:46.430 --> 19:48.450
It appears the Changelings
stole your body

19:48.650 --> 19:51.410
to weaponize that Borg
genetic code.

19:51.610 --> 19:53.150
PICARD:
But the ensigns Jack
was able to control

19:53.350 --> 19:54.810
were never assimilated.

19:55.010 --> 19:57.200
How could they receive
his signals?

19:57.400 --> 19:59.160
That we do not know.

19:59.360 --> 20:03.200
So this has been a dormant part
of Jack his entire life?

20:04.940 --> 20:07.250
How could I have missed that?

20:07.450 --> 20:08.950
Beverly, it's a testament to you

20:09.150 --> 20:12.480
that he managed to resist
for so long.

20:12.680 --> 20:15.640
He may be Borg,
but that is not all he is.

20:18.210 --> 20:19.790
So what now?

20:19.990 --> 20:21.620
Clearly, the Changelings
have been working with the Borg

20:21.820 --> 20:23.100
from the beginning.

20:23.300 --> 20:26.190
And as we speak,

29:34.930 --> 29:37.740
Judging by this simulation,
the Borg genetic material

29:37.940 --> 29:39.390
doesn't propagate in a species
