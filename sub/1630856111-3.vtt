00:06.972 --> 00:08.801
[wind gushing]

00:08.905 --> 00:11.080
[ominous music]

00:12.598 --> 00:15.808
It's not my imagination.
Someone is watching me.

00:15.912 --> 00:17.603
[exhales sharply]

00:17.707 --> 00:19.364
I thought I'd made it stop.

00:20.537 --> 00:22.539
The sooner, the better
I leave this place.

00:24.231 --> 00:25.680
Can you come over?

00:27.165 --> 00:28.097
[eerie music]

00:28.200 --> 00:30.582
Forget it. I have to go.

00:35.345 --> 00:37.761
[music intensifies]

00:45.321 --> 00:47.737
[kettle whistling]

00:51.913 --> 00:53.398

[car engine revs]

01:28.743 --> 01:31.298

01:37.097 --> 01:38.857
[bell tolling in distance]

01:38.960 --> 01:40.238
[Harry sighs]

01:40.341 --> 01:42.654
- Thanks for the ride, Harry.
- Ah. You're welcome.

01:42.757 --> 01:45.001
Great hunting in the woods
around here.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.141
Me and Sheila are gonna bag
a few pheasants, aren't we, eh?

01:47.245 --> 01:48.660
[Sheba whimpers]

01:48.763 --> 01:50.040
It's this new thing
I'm trying at the Goose.

01:50.144 --> 01:51.456
Locally sourced.

01:51.559 --> 01:53.147
Glenn, buddy,
do you mean Sheba?

01:53.251 --> 01:56.323
Yeah, Sheba is definitely
not a hunting dog, Glenn.

01:56.426 --> 01:57.910
That's why it's a good thing...

01:59.360 --> 02:01.328
that I brought my shotgun, eh?

02:01.431 --> 02:03.709
Glenn, no, no! Not here.

02:03.813 --> 02:04.952
Church.

02:05.055 --> 02:06.505
[zipper whirrs]

02:07.230 --> 02:08.887
Alright.

02:08.990 --> 02:10.923
Let's do this.

02:11.027 --> 02:12.201
Come on, Sheila!

02:12.304 --> 02:14.720
- Sheba. Glenn, Sheba!
- Ugh!

02:14.824 --> 02:15.894
[sighs]

02:15.997 --> 02:17.896
We should be getting
carer's allowance for him.

02:17.999 --> 02:19.208
Tell me about it.

02:19.311 --> 02:20.278
[Harry scoffs]

02:20.381 --> 02:22.314
[Sheba barking]

02:24.282 --> 02:26.007
[knocking on door]

02:26.111 --> 02:27.526
[Harry]Beautiful woman.

02:27.630 --> 02:29.079
And what does she do
for a living?

02:29.183 --> 02:30.564
She's a writer.

02:30.667 --> 02:31.599
Ah...

02:31.703 --> 02:34.706
So, erm, she went missing
last week?

02:34.809 --> 02:37.122
She was seen in the village
on Friday night

02:37.226 --> 02:39.089
and then, poof!

02:39.193 --> 02:40.539
When I came down, the cottage

02:40.643 --> 02:41.954
looked like it had
just been abandoned.

02:42.058 --> 02:43.818
And you phoned Wicklow police?

02:43.922 --> 02:47.512
Yeah. They keep saying that
she'll probably turn up, but...

02:47.615 --> 02:50.308
They think she's gone
and done something stupid.

02:50.411 --> 02:51.964
Why would they think that?

02:52.068 --> 02:53.552
[clock ticking]

02:53.656 --> 02:55.313
Please don't read too much
into this,

02:55.416 --> 02:58.281
but Alice's doctor
was treating her for depression.

02:58.385 --> 02:59.593
But she was just
wound up because

02:59.696 --> 03:01.250
she was so desperate
to sell this place.

03:01.353 --> 03:02.768
[inhales]
Why?

03:02.872 --> 03:04.632
This cottage, you see,
it's our Mam's

03:04.736 --> 03:06.979
old family home,
and she moved to Dublin.

03:07.083 --> 03:09.534
Dad died a few years ago,
so when she died last year,

03:09.637 --> 03:11.605
she left me the Dublin house.

03:11.708 --> 03:14.297
I was happy because my office
is near there.

03:14.401 --> 03:16.196
Oh. What do you do?

03:16.299 --> 03:18.336
I'm a conveyancing solicitor.

03:18.439 --> 03:21.994
Anyway, erm,
Mam left Alice this place.

03:22.098 --> 03:23.410
She was just trying to be fair,

03:23.513 --> 03:26.861
but the village
has always creeped us out.

03:26.965 --> 03:27.966
[suspenseful music]

03:28.069 --> 03:29.726
What makes it creepy?

03:29.830 --> 03:33.385
Wicklow Way has
always been... off.

03:33.489 --> 03:34.731
And the last time
I spoke to Alice,

03:34.835 --> 03:37.458
she said that odd things
had started happening.

03:37.562 --> 03:39.736
She was getting
phone calls at all hours,

03:39.840 --> 03:41.531
she felt like
she was being watched.

03:41.635 --> 03:43.395
And then there were
strange things on the porch,

03:43.499 --> 03:46.709
like bloody feathers
and a, a rat's tail...

03:46.812 --> 03:47.951
Jesus!

03:48.055 --> 03:50.954
Sorry, why would somebody
be trying to scare her?

03:53.440 --> 03:54.820
I need to show you something.

03:54.924 --> 03:57.340
[ominous music]

04:00.550 --> 04:02.759
Alice was writing
a book about it.

04:02.863 --> 04:03.795
About the devil?

04:03.898 --> 04:06.142
About devil worship here,
in Wicklow Way.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.730
I was not expecting that.

04:07.833 --> 04:08.765
Me neither.

04:08.869 --> 04:10.664
[Harry]Fergus,
take lots of photographs.

04:10.767 --> 04:11.803
We're going to need
to go through these later.

04:11.906 --> 04:13.011
[Fergus]Mm-mm.

04:13.114 --> 04:15.289
[Glenn]Harry! Harry!

04:15.393 --> 04:16.946
- Is that Glenn?
- Yeah.

04:17.049 --> 04:18.844
[tense music]

04:18.948 --> 04:20.294
Harry!

04:21.399 --> 04:23.297
- Harry!
- What, Glenn?

04:24.988 --> 04:27.025
A body, in the woods.

04:27.128 --> 04:28.992
A dead one! Come on!

04:29.096 --> 04:31.512
[tense music]

04:34.757 --> 04:36.931
[Glenn] We found it here,
by this stream.

04:37.035 --> 04:38.657
[Leanne] Is it Alice?

04:38.761 --> 04:41.073
[Glenn grunting]

04:41.177 --> 04:42.592
Over here!

04:44.732 --> 04:45.837
Here we are.

04:45.940 --> 04:47.873
[sighs]
Are you kidding?

04:51.256 --> 04:52.395
Glenn, ya dope!

04:52.499 --> 04:54.363
Well, it was a body once!

04:57.400 --> 04:59.368
Oh, don't!

04:59.471 --> 05:00.921
We still need the police.

05:01.024 --> 05:03.544
I mean, there shouldn't be
a skeleton lying out like that.

05:05.891 --> 05:07.272
Bloody hell!

05:07.376 --> 05:09.170
I've only gone
and lost the dog!

05:09.274 --> 05:10.965
Sheila!

05:11.069 --> 05:12.795
Petra's gonna kill me!

05:12.898 --> 05:14.417
Sheila!

05:15.384 --> 05:17.972
[suspenseful music]

05:18.076 --> 05:18.939
[door closes]

05:19.042 --> 05:20.527
A skeleton?

05:20.630 --> 05:22.183
[Charlie]
Bloody hell, mum.

05:22.287 --> 05:24.600
Those cold cases are a bugger.

05:24.703 --> 05:26.636
I'll get the local lads on it.

05:27.672 --> 05:29.743
Well, it's certainly not Alice.

05:32.953 --> 05:34.472
What is it?

05:35.473 --> 05:37.923
[suspenseful music]

05:41.099 --> 05:42.445
[camera clicks]

05:44.413 --> 05:46.138
[Harry]
That ring on the finger.

05:47.554 --> 05:50.488
I'm gonna ask
Graham Gray about it.

05:50.591 --> 05:52.352
That man knows his history.

05:53.491 --> 05:54.733
Hooves?

05:54.837 --> 05:57.046
They're the devil's thing,
aren't they?

05:57.149 --> 05:59.738
And Alice was writing a book
about devil worship.

05:59.842 --> 06:01.119
[Harry sighs]

06:01.222 --> 06:03.846
I mean, you're the one who
doesn't believe in coincidence.

06:07.574 --> 06:09.714
[dog barking in distance]

06:09.817 --> 06:11.716
Thank you for your time,
Mr. Mac Giolla BhÃ¡in.

06:11.819 --> 06:12.924
Thank you.

06:14.132 --> 06:15.685
[barking continues]

06:15.789 --> 06:16.928
Who was he?

06:17.031 --> 06:18.654
He was doing some survey.

06:20.449 --> 06:21.829
What're you doing here?

06:21.933 --> 06:22.968
Can we talk?

06:24.211 --> 06:25.557
Inside?

06:27.421 --> 06:29.181
As long as Malky isn't here.

06:33.876 --> 06:34.842
[keys jangle]

06:34.946 --> 06:36.257
[door opens]

06:36.361 --> 06:38.363
[keys jangle]

06:38.467 --> 06:39.709
Da?

06:42.160 --> 06:43.472
Malky?

06:50.133 --> 06:51.652
[door shuts]

06:51.756 --> 06:54.310
[sighs]
This feels strange.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.760
[keys jangle]

07:00.972 --> 07:02.007
[cutlery clinks]

07:04.941 --> 07:06.218
[Paula sighs]

07:07.427 --> 07:08.807
Jeez, nothing's changed.

07:13.640 --> 07:15.435
What do you want to talk about?

07:18.472 --> 07:20.025
I need to see Liberty

07:20.129 --> 07:22.649
and I know to do that, I need
to make amends with Malky.

07:22.752 --> 07:23.857
[scoffs]

07:24.927 --> 07:26.066
[sniffles]

07:26.169 --> 07:27.447
How can I make it up to him?

07:27.550 --> 07:29.241
[Fergus] Well, you have
to give him some time.

07:29.345 --> 07:30.242
You have to give us
all some time.

07:30.346 --> 07:31.416
I know that!

07:31.520 --> 07:34.005
And still, you're here now.

07:35.593 --> 07:37.387
Point taken.

07:37.491 --> 07:38.665
I'll go.

07:39.700 --> 07:41.599
Can I use the bathroom quickly?

07:41.702 --> 07:43.014
Top of the...

07:45.775 --> 07:47.570
You know where it is.

07:54.266 --> 07:56.821
[suspenseful music]

08:12.112 --> 08:14.286
[whispers]
Oh, shit!

08:17.462 --> 08:18.912
[camera clicks]

08:24.676 --> 08:26.195
Alright, thanks.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.165
I'll see ya soon?

08:32.615 --> 08:33.823
Okay.

08:35.929 --> 08:37.171
[sighs]

08:37.275 --> 08:38.759
[suspenseful music]

08:38.863 --> 08:41.141
[seagulls squawking]

08:41.244 --> 08:42.349
[door closes]

08:42.452 --> 08:43.764
You were right.

08:43.868 --> 08:45.076
Once more for the tape.

08:45.179 --> 08:46.802
I was right, you say?

08:46.905 --> 08:49.045
There's no such thing
as coincidence.

08:49.149 --> 08:50.357
[car doors slam]

08:50.460 --> 08:52.255
Okay. We're meeting Graham

08:52.359 --> 08:53.602
at some ruins near those woods.

08:53.705 --> 08:55.258
[car door opens]

08:57.433 --> 08:58.434
Hi, granny.

08:58.538 --> 08:59.677
Oh.

09:00.609 --> 09:01.679
You've been avoiding me.

09:01.782 --> 09:03.577
- Have not!
- Er, yes, you have.

09:03.681 --> 09:05.475
Because I keep asking
how it's going with your mother.

09:05.579 --> 09:07.029
[sighs]

09:07.132 --> 09:10.066
And I get it, but, when my mum
banned me from seeing you,

09:10.170 --> 09:12.759
I didn't tell you
and we didn't talk,

09:12.862 --> 09:14.657
and did that help us?

09:14.761 --> 09:15.796
No, it did not.

09:15.900 --> 09:17.522
Darling, we're actually
on a case.

09:17.626 --> 09:19.041
Look, I do wanna talk
to you, alright?

09:19.144 --> 09:21.181
I'm just still trying to sort
some stuff out in my head.

09:21.284 --> 09:22.251
Are we actually doing this?

09:22.354 --> 09:23.390
Look, I promise, when I'm ready

09:23.493 --> 09:24.494
you'll be the
first person I ask.

09:24.598 --> 09:25.772
Charming.

09:25.875 --> 09:27.946
- I didn't mean--
- I know you didn't.

09:28.050 --> 09:30.086
And Lola's right.

09:30.190 --> 09:33.331
And I'm here for you, too,
when you want to start talking.

09:33.434 --> 09:34.643
Lola, time to scoot.

09:34.746 --> 09:35.885
[chuckles]

09:35.989 --> 09:38.163
Didn't I say?
I'm coming with you.

09:38.267 --> 09:39.233
[Harry sighs]

09:39.337 --> 09:40.649
I barely get to spend any time

09:40.752 --> 09:42.202
with Fergus when the
two of you are on a case.

09:42.305 --> 09:43.997
So, er...

09:44.100 --> 09:45.308
[plastic rustling]

09:45.412 --> 09:46.309
Road-trip.

09:46.413 --> 09:47.897
Nice one!

09:48.001 --> 09:49.968
Dear God.
Well, if you insist on coming,

09:50.072 --> 09:52.799
you can at least get
an education on route.

09:52.902 --> 09:54.524
Mussorgsky, anyone?

09:54.628 --> 09:56.492
[both groaning]

09:56.596 --> 09:57.493
[sighs]

09:57.597 --> 09:58.770
[car engine starts]

09:58.874 --> 10:01.324
[dramatic music]

10:11.369 --> 10:12.681
[Graham] Devil worshipping!

10:13.820 --> 10:15.580
And it all started here!

10:15.684 --> 10:16.788
Eh, what kind of mysteries have

10:16.892 --> 10:18.376
you guys been
solving these days?

10:18.479 --> 10:20.171
[chuckles]
Go on, Graham.

10:20.274 --> 10:22.138
I know you're bursting
to share what you know.

10:22.242 --> 10:24.416
I am, Harry, I am!

10:24.520 --> 10:26.556
You see, 80 years ago,

10:26.660 --> 10:28.869
several of the
Wicklow Way elders

10:28.973 --> 10:31.044
formed a collective of sorts.

10:31.147 --> 10:32.597
They were led
by Maurice Lehane,

10:32.701 --> 10:35.255
who had fought
in the War of Independence.

10:35.358 --> 10:36.808
The British were gone,

10:36.912 --> 10:39.397
but many viewed
the Catholic Church

10:39.500 --> 10:40.674
as the new oppressors.

10:40.778 --> 10:43.643
[scoffs]
What? The Church conservative?

10:43.746 --> 10:45.506
Indeed!

10:45.610 --> 10:47.923
But this group of men,
under Maurice,

10:48.026 --> 10:50.511
thwarted the Church's influence.

10:50.615 --> 10:53.411
Wicklow Way
was very progressive.

10:53.514 --> 10:55.689
Young people had dances,

10:55.793 --> 10:57.864
drinking and gambling
were allowed.

10:57.967 --> 10:59.037
[suspenseful music]

10:59.141 --> 11:01.384
People stopped going to mass.

11:02.627 --> 11:05.388
The men would meet right here

11:05.492 --> 11:09.220
and, after a time,
somebody started a rumour.

11:09.323 --> 11:11.705
They said one night,

11:11.809 --> 11:13.673
the men opened the door,

11:13.776 --> 11:16.883
and the devil was there
to praise their work.

11:16.986 --> 11:18.781
Mm. The actual devil?

11:18.885 --> 11:20.852
Oh, for heaven's sakes, Fergus.

11:20.956 --> 11:23.717
The rumour was started
to discredit the guys.

11:23.821 --> 11:25.270
[Graham] Exactly!

11:25.374 --> 11:27.583
It was a lie...

11:27.687 --> 11:30.172
and the men weren't fazed,
at first.

11:30.275 --> 11:31.621
[music continues]

11:31.725 --> 11:34.210
Maurice even had a number
of rings commissioned

11:34.314 --> 11:36.350
with the devil's hoof
on the bezel.

11:36.454 --> 11:37.835
[crow cawing in distance]

11:37.938 --> 11:40.872
There's a book circulating
around these parts.

11:40.976 --> 11:45.152
"Wicklow Way, A History of
Devil Worship and Redemption."

11:45.256 --> 11:48.500
It describes the men
begging for forgiveness.

11:48.604 --> 11:51.055
They do say that when he died,

11:51.158 --> 11:54.886
Maurice had his wife bury him
with his ring.

11:54.990 --> 11:57.371
A one-fingered salute
to the Church.

11:58.994 --> 12:02.514
But he should be
in the village graveyard.

12:03.757 --> 12:06.277
[ominous music]

12:17.633 --> 12:18.530
Here.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.225
There he is.

12:23.328 --> 12:24.536
Still buried.

12:28.540 --> 12:29.541
[sighs]

12:29.645 --> 12:31.474
Something's not right.

12:31.578 --> 12:34.512
I mean, look around.
This grave has been disturbed.

12:35.927 --> 12:37.722
Oh, wait...

12:37.826 --> 12:38.965
[pensive music]

12:39.068 --> 12:41.208
Oh, Christ, Harry! You can't!

12:41.312 --> 12:42.175
[sighs]

12:42.278 --> 12:44.556
He's been dead 60 years, Graham.

12:46.006 --> 12:48.008
I mean, all we'd be doing
is finding out

12:48.112 --> 12:50.424
if somebody has been
tampering with his grave.

12:50.528 --> 12:51.909
Phone Charlie, Harry.

12:52.012 --> 12:54.739
Oh, you know what
the guards are like, Graham.

12:54.843 --> 12:57.466
You know, paperwork that,
exhumation this.

12:57.569 --> 12:59.226
We'd be waiting forever.

13:00.227 --> 13:01.746
Good God!

13:01.850 --> 13:04.093
[chuckles]
We all know where this is going.

13:04.197 --> 13:06.613
Let's just get on with it.

13:06.716 --> 13:09.685
Sweets, cola,
a bit of tomb-raiding.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.963
[Fergus]I've told ya you're
the perfect woman, right?

13:12.067 --> 13:14.000
[shovel scraping]

13:15.656 --> 13:18.038
[music continues]

13:25.874 --> 13:27.599
[Fergus]
That sounds like wood.

13:29.394 --> 13:30.740
[clanks]

13:30.844 --> 13:33.295
[pensive music]

13:34.952 --> 13:37.886
This coffin is way too close
to the surface, Harry.

13:37.989 --> 13:39.335
It's been opened before.

13:39.439 --> 13:41.027
Look.

13:41.130 --> 13:44.202
Well, my guess is, we won't
be finding Maurice in there.

13:44.306 --> 13:46.791
I-I still don't think
that we should--

13:46.895 --> 13:47.861
Fergus!

13:47.965 --> 13:49.621
[Fergus grunting]

13:50.899 --> 13:51.831
[coffin cracks]

13:51.934 --> 13:52.901
[dramatic music]

13:53.004 --> 13:54.730
- Oh!
- Ugh!

13:54.834 --> 13:57.215
[ominous music]

14:00.736 --> 14:01.979
Oh, it's Alice.

14:02.082 --> 14:04.360
Mm. Alice Dowdall.

14:08.330 --> 14:09.572
[Fergus sniffles]

14:12.886 --> 14:13.956
[camera shutters clicking]

14:14.060 --> 14:15.509
[indistinct chattering]

14:15.613 --> 14:17.960
Graham, take Lola before
her father sees her.

14:18.064 --> 14:19.548
He won't wait for context.

14:19.651 --> 14:21.584
Oh, for God's sake!

14:21.688 --> 14:23.207
Come on.

14:23.310 --> 14:24.415
Bye!

14:24.518 --> 14:25.865
[camera shutter clicking]

14:26.831 --> 14:28.384
[indistinct radio chatter]

14:29.730 --> 14:30.904
You're welcome.

14:31.008 --> 14:33.803
A missing person
and a missing skeleton ID

14:33.907 --> 14:35.598
all solved in one go.

14:35.702 --> 14:38.394
You know the local officers
think I should caution you.

14:38.498 --> 14:39.913
Oh, Christ on a bike.

14:40.017 --> 14:41.846
That grave had already
been disturbed.

14:41.950 --> 14:43.883
[sighs]

14:43.986 --> 14:46.782
Can you even still investigate
if you're Chief?

14:46.886 --> 14:49.302
Acting. I'm still
in charge of my squad.

14:49.405 --> 14:51.304
[chuckles]
Oh.

14:51.407 --> 14:54.100
Well, did you find out anything
about that skeleton?

14:54.203 --> 14:55.618
Is it Maurice Lehane?

14:55.722 --> 14:58.794
The initial examination revealed
it's roughly 60 years old

14:58.898 --> 15:03.005
and died from TB, which fits
with Maurice Lehane's records.

15:03.109 --> 15:05.283
Do they know how Alice died yet?

15:05.387 --> 15:07.354
I talked to crime scene
on the way down.

15:07.458 --> 15:09.943
They said they found
ligature marks on her neck.

15:10.047 --> 15:11.738
Look, Harry,

15:11.841 --> 15:14.603
we've the local doctor
on his way down to identify her.

15:14.706 --> 15:17.123
You've found your
missing person. You can...

15:17.226 --> 15:19.125
[sighs]
You know what,

15:19.228 --> 15:20.574
I'll save my breath.

15:20.678 --> 15:22.576
That would be best, darling.

15:22.680 --> 15:25.269
[instrumental music]

15:26.891 --> 15:28.651
[door shuts]

15:28.755 --> 15:30.722
Excuse me! Are you the doctor?

15:30.826 --> 15:31.965
Sorry, I'm on urgent business.

15:32.069 --> 15:33.656
Identifying the body?

15:34.934 --> 15:36.245
Who are you?

15:37.695 --> 15:38.972
Wild-Reid Detectives.

15:39.076 --> 15:42.320
We were hired by
Alice Dowdall's sister, Leanne.

15:42.424 --> 15:44.357
She was scared,
according to her sister.

15:44.460 --> 15:45.910
Somebody was trying
to intimidate her.

15:46.014 --> 15:47.429
[suspenseful music]

15:47.532 --> 15:48.637
You were her doctor.

15:48.740 --> 15:51.571
You prescribed her medications
for depression.

15:51.674 --> 15:54.022
Had she told you anything
about what was happening?

15:54.125 --> 15:55.955
That's patient confidentiality.

15:58.888 --> 16:01.029
Burying a body
in an existing grave,

16:01.132 --> 16:02.478
that's genius.

16:03.652 --> 16:06.206
But why leave would
you leave a skeleton out

16:06.310 --> 16:07.828
where it could be found?

16:07.932 --> 16:10.728
Maybe it was better hidden,
but animals dragged it out?

16:10.831 --> 16:14.145
No, I mean why would you
take the skeleton out at all?

16:14.249 --> 16:16.320
Whoever killed her
didn't want her sharing

16:16.423 --> 16:18.736
the grave with
a notorious devil worshipper?

16:18.839 --> 16:21.256
[ominous music]

16:23.706 --> 16:26.744
This village is giving me
weird vibes, Harry.

16:26.847 --> 16:29.850
It's like "The Valley
of the Squinting Windows."

16:29.954 --> 16:31.404
You read that?

16:31.507 --> 16:34.165
[Fergus]
Yeah. Got it from the library.

16:34.269 --> 16:36.961
[chuckles]
You took a Brinsley MacNamara

16:37.065 --> 16:38.825
classic out of the library?

16:38.928 --> 16:41.069
It's a shitty council library,
alright?

16:41.172 --> 16:42.898
I've Orwell's
"Keep the Aspidistra Flying"

16:43.002 --> 16:44.348
on hold for next week.

16:44.451 --> 16:48.076
Oh, well, if it's Orwell
you want, take out "1984."

16:48.179 --> 16:49.594
Unless you don't like rats.

16:49.698 --> 16:51.079
- Ugh.
- Come on.

16:51.182 --> 16:53.598
[music continues]

16:54.841 --> 16:56.256
[door bell chimes]

17:01.020 --> 17:02.780
[pensive music]

17:04.195 --> 17:05.955
Uh. Two coffees.

17:06.059 --> 17:07.474
A couple of cream buns,

17:07.578 --> 17:10.753
and a slice of your
finest local gossip, please.

17:13.135 --> 17:14.619
We don't gossip around here.

17:15.862 --> 17:17.381
Is it true, then?

17:17.484 --> 17:19.590
You're the private detectives
and they just found

17:19.693 --> 17:21.074
Alice Dowdall's body?

17:21.178 --> 17:22.938
Well, that spread fast,
didn't it?

17:23.042 --> 17:24.560
My husband is the doctor.

17:24.664 --> 17:25.906
Oh, so you know Alice?

17:26.010 --> 17:27.529
Knew her.

17:27.632 --> 17:29.082
Mm.

17:29.186 --> 17:30.635
She wasn't well-liked.

17:30.739 --> 17:32.844
Fancied herself, that one.

17:32.948 --> 17:34.398
Always interfering.

17:35.744 --> 17:37.987
Bit harsh.

17:38.091 --> 17:41.301
We don't like nosy people
around here.

17:41.405 --> 17:43.545
Especially those
who ask questions

17:43.648 --> 17:46.824
but never tell you anything
about themselves.

17:46.927 --> 17:48.860
That was Alice.

17:48.964 --> 17:50.897
And there were rumours...

17:51.000 --> 17:52.726
What kind of rumours?

17:52.830 --> 17:55.764
Well, not that I'd spread any,

17:55.867 --> 17:58.974
but they say she had an eye
for married men.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.734
A harlot, you'd call her.

18:02.046 --> 18:04.531
But I shouldn't speak ill
of the dead.

18:04.635 --> 18:06.085
You, er...
Do you happen to know anything

18:06.188 --> 18:07.741
about this devil worship legend?

18:07.845 --> 18:10.503
We've heard Alice
was interested in it.

18:10.606 --> 18:12.884
No. I wouldn't know
anything about that.

18:12.988 --> 18:14.783
[music continues]

18:20.961 --> 18:21.893
[door bell chimes]

18:21.997 --> 18:23.826
[Fergus sighs]

18:23.930 --> 18:25.518
[door shuts]

18:25.621 --> 18:26.519
You two.

18:26.622 --> 18:29.108
You were in my cemetery.
Why didn't you alert me?

18:29.211 --> 18:30.799
Alert you?

18:30.902 --> 18:33.767
People come to me
when there is a crisis.

18:33.871 --> 18:36.805
Well, we weren't planning
on breaking any commandments.

18:37.737 --> 18:39.118
We found a dead body.

18:39.221 --> 18:41.085
[Fergus]Appreciate that sounds
a bit mental,

18:41.189 --> 18:43.260
considering
we were in a graveyard.

18:43.363 --> 18:46.711
There are police
traipsing everywhere.

18:46.815 --> 18:49.438
It's outrageous that
I wasn't informed first.

18:49.542 --> 18:52.061
A woman has been murdered.

18:52.165 --> 18:53.925
And we think
you can help us, Father.

18:54.029 --> 18:55.582
Alice's body was found
in the grave

18:55.686 --> 18:58.723
of a man who was
allegedly notorious.

18:58.827 --> 19:00.104
Maurice Lehane.

19:00.208 --> 19:01.830
We do not talk about him!

19:01.933 --> 19:03.556
[Fergus]
We're only asking because Alice

19:03.659 --> 19:05.765
was writing a book
about devil worship, so...

19:05.868 --> 19:10.494
And I saw a woman sit upon
a scarlet-coloured beast,

19:10.597 --> 19:13.117
full with names of blasphemy,

19:13.221 --> 19:16.569
having seven heads
and ten horns!

19:17.466 --> 19:19.296
Do not do what they do,

19:19.399 --> 19:21.505
for they do not practice
what they preach.

19:21.608 --> 19:24.680
They tie up heavy,
cumbersome loads

19:24.784 --> 19:26.958
and put them on other
people's shoulders,

19:27.062 --> 19:30.790
while they themselves are
not willing to lift a finger.

19:30.893 --> 19:33.310
[music continues]

19:34.173 --> 19:35.450
[door opens]

19:36.485 --> 19:38.625
You wanna tell me
what that was?

19:38.729 --> 19:42.146
"The Bible," Fergus,
it's a fascinating read.

19:42.250 --> 19:44.942
I'm pretty sure
that he was calling her

19:45.045 --> 19:46.392
the Whore of Babylon.

19:48.014 --> 19:50.327
So, er, I gave him a quote

19:50.430 --> 19:53.778
about the abomination
of priests to mull on.

19:53.882 --> 19:54.952
[ominous music]

19:55.055 --> 19:56.609
[owl hoots]

19:56.712 --> 19:59.819
We'll need to know more
about Alice, Leanne.

19:59.922 --> 20:01.407
Was she seeing somebody?

20:01.510 --> 20:03.512
That's the problem,
I don't know.

20:03.616 --> 20:06.239
I feel so guilty,
but we weren't close.

20:06.343 --> 20:07.896
I loved her, but we were
just our own people,

20:07.999 --> 20:10.036
and her phone is still missing,
so the police

20:10.139 --> 20:11.589
don't know
who she was talking to.

20:11.693 --> 20:14.143
When did she start taking
the tablets for depression?

20:14.247 --> 20:16.284
Only recently, I think.

20:16.387 --> 20:17.940
I didn't think anything of it
when she said

20:18.044 --> 20:19.148
because it runs in our family.

20:19.252 --> 20:20.633
Like our aunts and...

20:20.736 --> 20:22.635
But then she said all
this scary stuff had started

20:22.738 --> 20:25.534
happening, and honestly,
I didn't take it seriously.

20:25.638 --> 20:28.675
Did she have any idea of
who was trying to frighten her?

20:28.779 --> 20:30.815
I know she found
the next-door neighbour creepy.

20:30.919 --> 20:32.058
Mossy Sheridan.

20:32.161 --> 20:34.543
He farms a bit of land
and does odd jobs and stuff,

20:34.647 --> 20:37.132
but I'm sure he's
not actually dangerous.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.410
Well, we'll that
a look at him, but

20:39.514 --> 20:41.447
maybe if she was seeing
somebody in secret,

20:41.550 --> 20:43.552
they wanted to keep it that way.

20:43.656 --> 20:45.623
But why go through
the theatrics of putting her

20:45.727 --> 20:47.694
in the grave of
an old devil worshipper?

20:48.868 --> 20:49.834
[sighs]

20:49.938 --> 20:51.180
What is it?

20:51.284 --> 20:52.561
You'll think I'm nuts.

20:52.665 --> 20:55.978
Oh, if you knew half the things
we've heard and seen.

20:56.082 --> 20:57.704
You can tell us.

20:57.808 --> 21:00.880
I think Alice
stumbled on something.

21:00.983 --> 21:02.399
About the villagers.

21:02.502 --> 21:06.334
I think... I think they
still worship the devil.

21:06.437 --> 21:07.887
Up at the old ruins.

21:07.990 --> 21:09.647
[ominous music]

21:10.855 --> 21:12.063
[Harry sighs]

21:12.167 --> 21:13.962
It's all silly nonsense, Fergus.

21:14.065 --> 21:15.826
Oh, I don't know, Harry.

21:15.929 --> 21:19.450
This village is giving me
the heebie jeebies.

21:19.554 --> 21:22.971
There is one way to find out
if the locals are up to no good.

21:24.938 --> 21:26.181
Alright.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.665
[car doors open]

21:30.461 --> 21:32.325
[Fergus] Well, this is creepier
than I expected.

21:32.429 --> 21:33.913
[Harry]
It was your idea.

21:35.190 --> 21:36.571
Maybe the devil will appear.

21:36.674 --> 21:38.987
Ha-ha, very funny.
I'm not rising to you, Harry.

21:39.090 --> 21:40.747
Is that chanting?

21:40.851 --> 21:43.163
[group chanting]

21:43.267 --> 21:44.889
What the hell?

21:44.993 --> 21:46.753
[tense music]

21:48.065 --> 21:49.204
Bugger this.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.137
Harry! Bloody hell.

21:51.240 --> 21:52.552
Shit. I don't mean that.

21:52.656 --> 21:54.934
There is no hell.
No devil, no hell.

21:55.037 --> 21:57.454
[chanting continues]

21:59.973 --> 22:03.149
[female #1]
You do not belong here. Leave.

22:03.252 --> 22:05.600
[all]
Leave! Leave!

22:05.703 --> 22:09.983
Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave!

22:10.087 --> 22:12.054
Okay, Harry, maybe we should go?

22:12.158 --> 22:13.504
My arse.

22:13.608 --> 22:16.956
Does Father Lucas
know about you lot? Hm?

22:17.059 --> 22:20.994
The church does still
ex-communicate, doesn't it?

22:21.098 --> 22:22.893
Fergus, let's call him.

22:22.996 --> 22:23.997
[Donna]Don't do that!

22:24.101 --> 22:25.274
[suspenseful music]

22:25.378 --> 22:26.828
It's not what you think.

22:28.001 --> 22:29.555
We're all good Catholics.

22:29.658 --> 22:30.245
[scoffs]

22:30.349 --> 22:32.281
No, really!

22:32.385 --> 22:34.560
We run the village tourist board

22:34.663 --> 22:37.735
and we got together and thought
we could tap into the myth

22:37.839 --> 22:39.634
to try and attract
some holiday makers.

22:39.737 --> 22:42.257
We're planning re-enactments,

22:42.361 --> 22:45.502
we're making the village
a spooky destination.

22:45.605 --> 22:47.262
Did Alice know
what you were doing?

22:47.366 --> 22:49.678
Of course she bloody did.

22:49.782 --> 22:52.543
She'd been asking Mossy here
what we were up to,

22:52.647 --> 22:54.338
and she told him
that she would be writing

22:54.442 --> 22:56.133
a book that would
tell the truth.

22:56.236 --> 22:59.999
That our devil worship legend
was started on a lie.

23:00.102 --> 23:01.241
[breathing heavily]

23:01.345 --> 23:03.796
So typical of her
to cause problems.

23:05.038 --> 23:06.177
Hmm.

23:06.281 --> 23:07.593
[mellow music]

23:07.696 --> 23:09.077
[Fergus] Could one of them
have killed her

23:09.180 --> 23:10.699
because she was going to
mess up their tourism plans?

23:10.803 --> 23:12.805
[Harry]
It can't be that inane, Fergus.

23:12.908 --> 23:14.565
I mean, I can understand
them being upset,

23:14.669 --> 23:17.430
but something else
is at play here.

23:17.534 --> 23:19.605
Little villages like this,

23:19.708 --> 23:22.677
I mean, they're always bursting
at the seams with secrets.

23:22.780 --> 23:24.610
Like "Valley of
the Squinting Windows."

23:24.713 --> 23:26.163
[sighs]
Exactly.

23:26.266 --> 23:28.648
[dramatic music]

23:36.242 --> 23:37.485
[Harry sighs]

23:37.588 --> 23:40.626
What is it?
"Maurice Lehane."

23:42.075 --> 23:44.388
Hmm.

23:44.492 --> 23:46.494
[seagulls squawking
in distance]

23:48.737 --> 23:51.222
[Fergus]
"Purgation."

23:51.326 --> 23:52.741
What the hell
does that even mean?

23:54.225 --> 23:55.675
[sighs]

24:00.093 --> 24:01.440
What are you up to, ma?

24:01.543 --> 24:03.614
[dog barking in distance]

24:03.718 --> 24:06.099
[line ringing]

24:06.203 --> 24:09.413
[man on phone]Council Housing
Department, how can I help?

24:09.517 --> 24:11.864
Ahem.
Is Mr. Mac Giolla BhÃ¡in there?

24:11.967 --> 24:13.521
[man on phone]
He's out at the moment.

24:13.624 --> 24:15.005
Can I take a message?

24:15.108 --> 24:16.489
[sighs]

24:19.043 --> 24:21.460
[wind blowing]

24:25.464 --> 24:26.810
[car door opens]

24:29.088 --> 24:29.985
[car door shuts]

24:30.089 --> 24:31.055
[Fergus sighs]

24:31.159 --> 24:32.505
[sniffles]

24:34.058 --> 24:35.404
You have that look.

24:35.508 --> 24:37.579
You're young and tech savvy.

24:37.683 --> 24:38.994
How do I find
somebody's parents

24:39.098 --> 24:41.687
if I can't apply
for their birth certificate?

24:41.790 --> 24:43.999
Do you know their age
and where they were born?

24:44.103 --> 24:45.518
Mm, rough guess at age,

24:45.622 --> 24:47.451
pretty certain I know
where they were born.

24:47.555 --> 24:49.626
Then there's nothing
tech savvy about it.

24:49.729 --> 24:51.213
Baptism book
in the local church.

24:51.317 --> 24:52.629
Ah, of course!

24:52.732 --> 24:55.977
[chuckles]
Didn't I train you well!

24:56.080 --> 24:57.116
[Fergus sighs]

24:57.219 --> 24:58.669
[car engine revving]

25:02.259 --> 25:04.675
[birds chirping in distance]

25:07.298 --> 25:08.507
[pensive music]

25:08.610 --> 25:10.232
Hello?

25:10.336 --> 25:11.717
Hello!

25:11.820 --> 25:13.926
You're Alice's neighbour Mossy,
aren't you?

25:14.029 --> 25:15.893
Do you work here?

25:15.997 --> 25:17.688
Sometimes.

25:17.792 --> 25:19.518
Did you know Alice well?

25:23.522 --> 25:25.627
Okay. That was odd.

25:27.905 --> 25:30.183
[Fergus]
So, he digs graves, Harry.

25:35.499 --> 25:38.295
Are we gonna ask that mad priest
for the baptism book, Harry?

25:38.398 --> 25:40.331
Because I don't think
he likes us.

25:40.435 --> 25:41.712
Where would they keep it?

25:41.816 --> 25:43.265
Maybe we could find it.

25:43.369 --> 25:46.096
- Find what?
- Jesus Christ!

25:46.199 --> 25:48.995
Uh, we're looking
for the baptism record book.

25:49.099 --> 25:53.344
We, erm, we think
that one of Fergus relatives

25:53.448 --> 25:54.967
might be there.

25:56.555 --> 25:57.625
Um...

25:57.728 --> 25:59.661
[sighs]
It, it would help us a lot

25:59.765 --> 26:01.352
if you could just get,

26:01.456 --> 26:03.009
get us that book.

26:03.113 --> 26:04.770
This way.

26:04.873 --> 26:06.426
[Fergus]I was a bit worried
that fella was gonna

26:06.530 --> 26:07.945
lead us into
a dungeon or something.

26:08.049 --> 26:09.982
Ah, Lucas Bartholomew Brady.

26:10.085 --> 26:11.811
What, the priest?

26:11.915 --> 26:14.158
Mother, Deirdre Brady.

26:14.262 --> 26:15.332
No father.

26:15.435 --> 26:16.713
[gasps]
Damn it.

26:16.816 --> 26:18.059
Illegitimate.

26:18.162 --> 26:19.543
Just like in my book!

26:19.647 --> 26:21.718
And you know that ended
in a murder, Harry.

26:23.927 --> 26:25.307
Wasn't there a family tree?

26:26.101 --> 26:27.137
What?

26:27.240 --> 26:29.208
The photos you took
in Alice's study.

26:29.311 --> 26:31.003
Uh, show them to me.

26:34.454 --> 26:36.802
Yes! Ah-ha!

26:36.905 --> 26:38.769
There he is, Maurice Lehane.

26:39.667 --> 26:41.738
Now it's all falling into place.

26:43.049 --> 26:44.326
No children.

26:44.430 --> 26:47.329
Okay. What does that mean?

26:47.433 --> 26:51.540
The headstone said,
"Beloved husband and father."

26:51.644 --> 26:53.301
His wife must have been...

26:54.233 --> 26:55.821
pretty generous.

26:55.924 --> 26:58.202
Look, you're gonna have to
fill me in here, Harry. I--

26:58.306 --> 27:00.653
[Lucas]
What is going on in my church?

27:00.757 --> 27:01.896
[pensive music]

27:01.999 --> 27:03.622
What do you think you're doing?

27:05.071 --> 27:06.555
Thank you.

27:06.659 --> 27:08.834
Now, explain yourselves.

27:08.937 --> 27:10.870
[chuckles]
Look!

27:10.974 --> 27:12.389
The scar, his left hand.

27:12.492 --> 27:15.634
That's what I realised, Fergus.
Surgical scarring.

27:15.737 --> 27:18.498
Maurice Lehane had
six fingers as well.

27:18.602 --> 27:20.293
It's hereditary.

27:20.397 --> 27:23.331
You... are Maurice Lehane's son.

27:24.884 --> 27:28.612
Oh, and what do you wish me
to say about that?

27:28.716 --> 27:31.580
You've solved
the mystery of my heritage.

27:31.684 --> 27:33.962
[chuckles]
Congratulations.

27:34.066 --> 27:36.689
And what do you plan to do
with this knowledge?

27:36.793 --> 27:39.692
Does my right to privacy
mean nothing?

27:41.383 --> 27:42.902
Father Lucas,

27:43.006 --> 27:44.455
I'm only curious
to see how eager

27:44.559 --> 27:46.423
you are to hide your parentage.

27:47.804 --> 27:49.737
Did you kill Alice
because of it?

27:51.014 --> 27:52.774
She figured it out as well,
didn't she?

27:52.878 --> 27:55.328
[music continues]

27:56.295 --> 27:57.848
I didn't kill anybody.

27:59.194 --> 28:00.609
She came to me,

28:00.713 --> 28:04.648
spouting nonsense about
that stupid little book of hers

28:04.752 --> 28:07.824
and about how she'd expose
how badly Lehane

28:07.927 --> 28:09.826
and his cronies had
been treated by the Church.

28:09.929 --> 28:12.035
I told her that
the definitive history

28:12.138 --> 28:14.485
of that period had been written.

28:16.384 --> 28:19.456
Those men begged forgiveness

28:19.559 --> 28:21.216
to avoid purgation.

28:23.771 --> 28:26.808
Well, there's never
just one side to history.

28:26.912 --> 28:28.776
[music continues]

28:28.879 --> 28:31.019
There is the right side.

28:31.123 --> 28:32.227
"Purgation."

28:32.331 --> 28:35.368
The cleansing of the soul
in purgatory.

28:35.472 --> 28:37.129
"Lucas Bartholomew Brady."

28:37.232 --> 28:38.958
[Harry]Fergus,
you're just saying words.

28:39.062 --> 28:40.649
No, no. Claus B. Darby.

28:40.753 --> 28:42.410
Lucas B. Brady.

28:42.513 --> 28:43.791
Oh, my God, you're right.

28:43.894 --> 28:45.827
This is an anagram!

28:45.931 --> 28:48.036
You wrote this book!

28:48.140 --> 28:49.693
You wanted people to think

28:49.797 --> 28:51.764
the story of Lehane
had been written.

28:51.868 --> 28:54.802
A man who lost his way,
but received

28:54.905 --> 28:56.458
salvation from the church.

28:57.943 --> 28:59.496
That is what happened!

28:59.599 --> 29:03.051
And he should have begged
forgiveness for my mother, too!

29:03.155 --> 29:06.986
Of course, Alice Dowdall
would have sympathy for him.

29:07.090 --> 29:09.402
She, herself, a sinner.

29:09.506 --> 29:10.749
But I tell you...

29:10.852 --> 29:13.717
I have nothing to seek
forgiveness for.

29:13.821 --> 29:15.788
I have removed the stain
on my family,

29:15.892 --> 29:19.102
and I have done
God's work all my life.

29:19.205 --> 29:21.794
God delivered Alice justice...

29:23.071 --> 29:25.384
but not through my hands!

29:25.487 --> 29:27.351
[music continues]

29:28.559 --> 29:30.941
[footsteps departing]

29:33.357 --> 29:34.738
Let me guess.

29:34.842 --> 29:36.153
You've figured out
that the priest

29:36.257 --> 29:38.777
is the son of the
local devil worshipper,

29:38.880 --> 29:41.434
and Alice was gonna
reveal it in a book.

29:41.538 --> 29:43.436
I'm a bloody copper, mum.

29:43.540 --> 29:45.093
I went through Alice's research.

29:45.197 --> 29:47.440
It says "Beloved father"
on Lehane's grave.

29:47.544 --> 29:48.717
I'm impressed.

29:48.821 --> 29:50.650
And you're late,
but I'm impressed.

29:50.754 --> 29:52.756
So, are you going to
arrest him, then?

29:52.860 --> 29:55.794
Pathology say Alice died
on the night of the 9th.

29:55.897 --> 29:57.692
Father Lucas was at
an ecclesiastical conference

29:57.796 --> 29:59.487
in Armagh for
that entire weekend.

29:59.590 --> 30:01.903
His alibi includes not one
but two bishops.

30:02.007 --> 30:04.561
Hm. Well, the Church
do like to cover up.

30:04.664 --> 30:06.805
This isn't the DaVinci Code!

30:06.908 --> 30:08.772
Well, he could have hired
someone to do it.

30:08.876 --> 30:10.670
He's got a few locals
working for him.

30:10.774 --> 30:12.017
He could have.

30:12.120 --> 30:13.742
But why put her in
Lehane's grave if he wanted

30:13.846 --> 30:16.159
to hide any links
to devil worship?

30:16.262 --> 30:17.574
Hmm.

30:26.134 --> 30:27.687
Now!

30:27.791 --> 30:29.828
- Mossy Sheridan, is it?
- Yeah.

30:29.931 --> 30:32.313
- Do you want to talk to me?
- How are you doing?

30:32.416 --> 30:33.901
What's that about?

30:35.281 --> 30:36.800
Don't know.

30:36.904 --> 30:38.802
Hmm.

30:38.906 --> 30:41.149
Well bloody done
on making the link between

30:41.253 --> 30:42.806
that book and the priest,
by the way.

30:42.910 --> 30:44.912
Yeah, well, I learned
from the master.

30:45.015 --> 30:46.706
Did you notice that he intimated

30:46.810 --> 30:48.639
that Alice
was an adulterer, too.

30:48.743 --> 30:51.435
I mean, look, Fergus,
the village is hardly crawling

30:51.539 --> 30:53.334
with attractive married men.

30:53.437 --> 30:54.749
[pensive music]

30:54.853 --> 30:56.061
Surely not.

30:56.993 --> 30:59.443
[indistinct chatter]

31:02.791 --> 31:05.380
I think the Doctor's been hiding
something from his wife.

31:08.452 --> 31:09.902
Ah, come on!

31:14.493 --> 31:15.804
[car doors open]

31:15.908 --> 31:17.254
[suspenseful music]

31:17.358 --> 31:20.602
- It was so obvious.
- Wait, he killed her?

31:20.706 --> 31:22.018
What?

31:22.121 --> 31:24.641
[Harry] You and Alice,
you were having an affair.

31:24.744 --> 31:26.056
Is that why
you were prescribing her

31:26.160 --> 31:28.058
all those depression pills?

31:28.162 --> 31:31.234
So that, that the people
would think she was unstable.

31:31.337 --> 31:33.926
The police would, would think
that shed topped herself?

31:34.030 --> 31:35.134
[Matt]Are you crazy?

31:35.238 --> 31:37.274
Alice asked for
that prescription.

31:37.378 --> 31:38.724
She was worried.

31:38.827 --> 31:41.037
She said her family had
a history of mental illness,

31:41.140 --> 31:43.177
shed started imagining things.

31:43.280 --> 31:45.627
You're not denying you were
having an affair with her?

31:45.731 --> 31:47.560
No!

31:47.664 --> 31:49.977
Did you need to silence her?

31:50.080 --> 31:51.840
Did your wife?

31:51.944 --> 31:53.152
I loved Alice.

31:53.256 --> 31:54.843
I would have done
anything for her.

31:54.947 --> 31:55.983
[suspenseful music]

31:56.086 --> 31:57.812
She didn't feel the same.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.883
To her, it was just a fling.

31:59.987 --> 32:01.402
I wanted to give her the world,

32:01.505 --> 32:03.956
but Alice wanted
her independence.

32:04.060 --> 32:05.130
Did your wife know?

32:05.233 --> 32:07.546
Of course not! I was careful.

32:07.649 --> 32:08.892
[scoffs]

32:08.996 --> 32:10.514
There's something
I haven't told the police.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.725
The night Alice disappeared,
she phoned me.

32:14.829 --> 32:17.487
Which is strange because
Alice rarely confided in me.

32:17.590 --> 32:19.558
Even when she came
asking for pills,

32:19.661 --> 32:21.318
she wouldn't open up.

32:21.422 --> 32:23.907
But that night,
she seemed desperate.

32:24.011 --> 32:25.840
[Matt]She asked
if I could call over.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.773
I couldn't.

32:27.876 --> 32:29.326
Donna was home.

32:31.052 --> 32:32.502
I should have gone to her.

32:33.675 --> 32:34.711
Yes.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.369
You should have.

32:38.163 --> 32:39.750
[crow cawing]

32:39.854 --> 32:42.063
[Harry]
Wait. What, what is it?

32:42.167 --> 32:43.133
Has something happened?

32:43.237 --> 32:44.583
I-I can't believe it!

32:44.686 --> 32:46.619
Oh, are you alright?

32:46.723 --> 32:48.035
He must have made Alice do it!

32:48.138 --> 32:50.037
Uh, uh. Slow down, Leanne.

32:50.140 --> 32:52.280
Who, who made Alice do what?

32:52.384 --> 32:54.317
She's left him all the land.

32:54.420 --> 32:55.456
What land?

32:55.559 --> 32:57.872
The 100 acres
behind the cottage.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.943
Our mother never
wanted that land farmed

33:00.047 --> 33:01.531
or developed,
it's all public walkways.

33:01.634 --> 33:05.017
But Alice has left it to him.
He'll farm the lot!

33:05.121 --> 33:06.225
To who?

33:06.329 --> 33:08.848
To Mossy bloody Sheridan!

33:08.952 --> 33:10.264
It all fits.

33:10.367 --> 33:12.576
I mean, Charlie is obviously
ahead of us.

33:12.680 --> 33:15.752
It fits and yet,
there's something not right.

33:15.855 --> 33:16.960
I don't know.

33:17.064 --> 33:18.997
Mossy seems pretty creepy to me.

33:19.100 --> 33:20.722
[pensive music]

33:20.826 --> 33:22.345
Look.

33:22.448 --> 33:24.416
I guess Charlie's done with him.

33:25.865 --> 33:27.591
[knocking on door]

33:29.869 --> 33:31.319
We know you're in there!

33:32.044 --> 33:33.735
[door opens]

33:42.537 --> 33:47.439
Mammy liked me to keep
the house nice... for visitors.

33:49.751 --> 33:52.271
I wonder if she's dead
in a rocker upstairs.

33:52.375 --> 33:54.584
[Mossy pouring tea]

33:54.687 --> 33:57.276
We know that the police
questioned you, Mossy...

33:58.277 --> 33:59.865
and we know about Alice's will.

33:59.968 --> 34:01.349
[thuds]

34:02.350 --> 34:05.181
You wanted her land, didn't you?

34:05.284 --> 34:06.803
You convinced her
to leave it to you.

34:06.906 --> 34:08.115
No!

34:08.218 --> 34:10.255
Didn't know Alice had me
in her will

34:10.358 --> 34:12.360
until the Guards said.

34:13.361 --> 34:16.399
That's hard to believe, Mossy.

34:16.502 --> 34:18.056
[loud thud]

34:21.473 --> 34:25.787
Alice didn't need
to leave me land.

34:25.891 --> 34:27.444
I was buying it.

34:27.548 --> 34:30.275
Wait, she was selling it to you?

34:30.378 --> 34:32.794
[suspenseful music]

34:42.356 --> 34:44.703
It's a deed of sale.

34:44.806 --> 34:46.118
100K.

34:46.222 --> 34:48.500
Oh, well, that's buttons.
None of this makes sense.

34:49.535 --> 34:51.365
She said I could farm half

34:51.468 --> 34:53.953
if I gave half of it
to the public.

34:54.057 --> 34:55.679
[soft music]

34:55.783 --> 34:57.095
I promised.

35:00.822 --> 35:01.892
I...

35:03.860 --> 35:05.344
liked Alice.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.314
Yes, yes.
Would you send it over?

35:09.417 --> 35:11.281
[chuckles]
Thank you.

35:11.385 --> 35:12.696
What did the solicitor say?

35:12.800 --> 35:14.008
[Harry sighs]

35:14.112 --> 35:16.079
He's confirmed that
he wrote up the deeds

35:16.183 --> 35:18.702
for Alice to sell to Mossy
at that price.

35:18.806 --> 35:20.808
He said Alice was
absolutely determined

35:20.911 --> 35:23.431
that Mossy would get that land.
Hence the will.

35:23.535 --> 35:25.640
But it sounds to me
as if she must have been afraid

35:25.744 --> 35:27.711
that something was
going to happen to her.

35:27.815 --> 35:29.817
Well, what's the solicitor
sending through?

35:31.163 --> 35:32.509
[chuckles]
Oh.

35:32.613 --> 35:34.960
Alice received
an offer recently.

35:35.063 --> 35:36.617
From a large developer.

35:36.720 --> 35:39.930
Her solicitor believes that
that's why she wanted to sell.

35:40.034 --> 35:41.346
[truck doors closing]

35:41.449 --> 35:42.933
What's going on there?

35:43.037 --> 35:44.107
Village of the Damned Tours?

35:44.211 --> 35:45.798
I can't believe it.

35:45.902 --> 35:46.868
Look at those people!

35:46.972 --> 35:48.318
[Fergus]Oh, no.

35:48.422 --> 35:49.906
There's the doctor's wife.

35:50.009 --> 35:51.528
Uh-oh, she's seen us.

35:53.081 --> 35:54.359
She's on her way.

35:54.462 --> 35:56.809
Oh, Jesus, here we go.

36:00.192 --> 36:01.642
[bell chimes]

36:03.161 --> 36:04.886
[door shuts]

36:04.990 --> 36:06.164
[chuckles]

36:06.267 --> 36:08.580
So the devil idea paid off,
I see?

36:08.683 --> 36:10.961
[chuckles]
We had an unexpected

36:11.065 --> 36:12.825
publicity boost.

36:12.929 --> 36:14.689
Alice's murder.

36:14.793 --> 36:17.554
People are going crazy
to come down.

36:17.658 --> 36:19.107
At least she was good
for something.

36:19.211 --> 36:21.558
- Jesus! That woman is--
- Dead.

36:21.662 --> 36:22.939
I know.

36:23.042 --> 36:24.147
And I'm glad.

36:24.251 --> 36:27.115
You knew about her
and your husband.

36:27.219 --> 36:28.910
I'll get over it.

36:29.014 --> 36:31.327
Matt is my family.

36:31.430 --> 36:34.019
Sometimes, it's a cross
you have to bear.

36:34.122 --> 36:35.123
[phone chimes]

36:35.227 --> 36:37.643
God, that is one angry woman.

36:37.747 --> 36:40.853
Alice's offer just came in
from the property developers.

36:40.957 --> 36:41.854
[suspenseful music]

36:41.958 --> 36:43.580
- Wow.
- What?

36:43.684 --> 36:46.963
They offered 1.5 million euros.

36:47.066 --> 36:50.173
And the solicitor says it could
have gone for much more.

36:50.277 --> 36:52.486
Who turns down
that sort of money?

36:52.589 --> 36:54.695
T-this crew specialises
in apartments.

36:54.798 --> 36:57.663
I mean, I guess she really
didn't want it developed.

37:00.701 --> 37:02.392
What?

37:02.496 --> 37:04.325
I'm an idiot, Fergus!

37:04.429 --> 37:06.362
All the parts
were out there for me,

37:06.465 --> 37:09.365
and... and I still
didn't see it.

37:10.228 --> 37:11.988
Come on.

37:12.091 --> 37:14.335
I have a plan.

37:14.439 --> 37:16.130
[Harry]
You said you loved Alice?

37:16.234 --> 37:17.442
Completely.

37:17.545 --> 37:19.064
Then you need to help her now.

37:19.167 --> 37:21.825
We need to have access to
somebody's medical records.

37:21.929 --> 37:23.448
[sighs]

37:23.551 --> 37:24.759
That can be difficult.

37:24.863 --> 37:26.968
[soft music]

37:33.665 --> 37:34.942
100K?

37:35.045 --> 37:38.083
Alice may as well have just
given the land away.

37:38.186 --> 37:39.809
The police realise that, right?

37:39.912 --> 37:41.224
Oh, yes, they do.

37:41.328 --> 37:42.708
I just spoke to
the lead detective.

37:42.812 --> 37:46.540
And they are convinced
that Mossy blackmailed Alice.

37:46.643 --> 37:49.128
Dr. Matt admitted
that Mossy knew

37:49.232 --> 37:50.992
about the affair with Alice.

37:51.096 --> 37:54.548
Mossy must have threatened to
out her unless she sold to him.

37:54.651 --> 37:56.584
But then, of course, he realised

37:56.688 --> 37:59.069
that it would be
much cheaper if she just

37:59.173 --> 38:00.830
left it all to him in her will.

38:02.003 --> 38:03.798
That is horrendous.

38:03.902 --> 38:05.662
That evil man!

38:05.766 --> 38:08.596
[Fergus]At least you know
everything now though, right?

38:08.700 --> 38:11.772
I mean, I just hope the guards
can find some sort of

38:11.875 --> 38:15.154
physical evidence that can help
connect Mossy to Alice's death.

38:15.258 --> 38:16.639
What do you mean?

38:16.742 --> 38:18.468
Aren't they going
to arrest him now?

38:18.572 --> 38:20.367
The detective in charge says
they don't have enough

38:20.470 --> 38:23.335
to prove that he killed her.

38:23.439 --> 38:27.339
Sure, he had no alibi,
and he had a motive...

38:27.443 --> 38:29.376
but that's not
enough without DNA

38:29.479 --> 38:31.239
or at least the murder weapon.

38:31.343 --> 38:33.345
[music continues]

38:34.553 --> 38:36.728
Sorry, Leanne.
Sorry we couldn't help more.

38:44.391 --> 38:46.807
[ominous music]

38:48.084 --> 38:49.534
[door opens]

39:03.133 --> 39:04.203
[light switch clicks]

39:04.307 --> 39:06.516
Planting some evidence, are we?

39:06.620 --> 39:09.761
Oh, we know it's you.
You can just take off that mask.

39:09.864 --> 39:11.107
I'll take that.

39:11.210 --> 39:12.902
[plastic rustling]

39:16.077 --> 39:20.772
[sighs] You set up the puzzle
for us to solve, didn't you,

39:20.875 --> 39:22.152
Leanne?

39:23.361 --> 39:24.707
But you underestimated us.

39:24.810 --> 39:27.226
See, you're the solicitor
that works for the company

39:27.330 --> 39:29.263
that offered to buy
Alice's land.

39:29.367 --> 39:30.678
You told them
you'd bring it in cheaper

39:30.782 --> 39:32.784
than market rate
when you got the job.

39:32.887 --> 39:35.338
In fact, it is the only reason
you got the job,

39:35.442 --> 39:36.926
because your CV
was a bit sketchy.

39:37.029 --> 39:38.237
[siren wailing]

39:38.341 --> 39:40.239
But Alice refused to sell.

39:40.343 --> 39:41.689
This is nonsense!

39:41.793 --> 39:44.209
I was just desperate
to get justice.

39:44.312 --> 39:45.728
Your boss is already talking.

39:45.831 --> 39:49.283
He wanted land, not to be
connected to a murder.

39:49.387 --> 39:52.838
There was one piece
that really bothered me.

39:52.942 --> 39:56.359
Alice obviously figured out
that you were scaring her.

39:56.463 --> 39:57.705
But I just never
understand why

39:57.809 --> 39:59.949
she thought you might
want to kill her.

40:00.052 --> 40:01.571
But then I realised...

40:01.675 --> 40:04.332
violent episodes
run in your family.

40:04.436 --> 40:05.989
[Fergus]Oh, they sure do!

40:06.093 --> 40:08.682
I mean, you've been in and out
of psychiatric hospitals.

40:08.785 --> 40:11.132
How do you know that?
That's private!

40:11.236 --> 40:12.444
Hey.

40:12.548 --> 40:15.171
[chuckles]
Her friends wanted to help her.

40:15.274 --> 40:17.173
Her medical friends.

40:17.276 --> 40:20.728
You knew the only way you could
get that land was by killing her

40:20.832 --> 40:23.628
and framing Mossy
for her murder.

40:23.731 --> 40:25.284
Yeah, you played on
all that devil worship

40:25.388 --> 40:26.562
stuff to get us to look at him,

40:26.665 --> 40:28.184
he was part of the local group,

40:28.287 --> 40:30.669
he worked in the cemetery
and could have dug up Lehane.

40:30.773 --> 40:33.154
You are a very twisted woman.

40:33.258 --> 40:35.225
[laughs]

40:35.329 --> 40:37.883
The mask has really slipped.

40:37.987 --> 40:38.815
[Leanne grunting]

40:38.919 --> 40:40.886
[Charlie]
Uh, no, no, no.

40:40.990 --> 40:43.786
Alright, let's get you down
the station. Get you processed.

40:43.889 --> 40:46.892
And then you can do
whatever worshipping you like

40:46.996 --> 40:48.135
from a jail cell.

40:48.238 --> 40:49.930
[Leanne grunting]

40:50.033 --> 40:51.449
[footsteps]

40:52.588 --> 40:53.589
[Charlie] Take her in!

40:53.692 --> 40:55.522
[indistinct radio chatter]

40:57.385 --> 40:59.974
Fell asleep upstairs.

41:00.078 --> 41:01.355
What did I miss?

41:01.459 --> 41:03.909
[soft music]

41:08.914 --> 41:10.191
Dare I ask?

41:10.295 --> 41:11.261
Saw it on one
of them late-night

41:11.365 --> 41:12.780
American shows, Harry.

41:12.884 --> 41:14.161
Fiver in.

41:14.264 --> 41:16.922
Whoever gets to the hottest
chilli and eats it first,

41:17.026 --> 41:18.441
no fuss,

41:18.545 --> 41:19.891
free pints for the night.

41:19.994 --> 41:22.721
Banban the Wise day
not work out then?

41:22.825 --> 41:25.621
Keeping it fresh, Fergus.
Keeping it fresh.

41:25.724 --> 41:27.726
[chuckles]
Well, what will you do

41:27.830 --> 41:30.418
if lots of people get
to the hottest chilli?

41:30.522 --> 41:32.938
Ah! Never gonna happen, Harry.

41:33.042 --> 41:34.353
I'll tell you why.

41:34.457 --> 41:35.769
So, for example...

41:35.872 --> 41:38.150
Someone starts
with the mildest one.

41:38.254 --> 41:39.531
Number one, right?

41:39.635 --> 41:40.843
[crunching]

41:40.946 --> 41:42.741
Then, um...

41:42.845 --> 41:45.882
[breathing heavily]
Hang on. Oh...

41:45.986 --> 41:47.297
[coughs]
Hang on.

41:47.401 --> 41:48.816
[Glenn] It's number ten!

41:48.920 --> 41:50.542
Argh!

41:50.646 --> 41:52.993
[coughing]

41:53.096 --> 41:54.166
That's the Pacino!

41:54.270 --> 41:56.203
[coughing]

41:58.032 --> 41:59.862
You better not tell your mum
I stopped in here.

41:59.965 --> 42:01.760
Call the emergency services!

42:01.864 --> 42:02.830
[coughs]

42:02.934 --> 42:04.038
Ambulance?

42:04.142 --> 42:05.971
No. Fire brigade!

42:06.075 --> 42:07.732
Fire! Uh-huh-huh!

42:07.835 --> 42:09.216
[Charlie]
I think it's a priest you want.

42:09.319 --> 42:11.218
[Glenn screaming]

42:11.321 --> 42:12.288
[Lola laughing]

42:12.391 --> 42:13.634
[Glenn spits]

42:13.738 --> 42:15.567
You're distracted.

42:15.671 --> 42:18.743
Yeah. I gotta, I gotta
sort something for tomorrow.

42:18.846 --> 42:20.020
Mum?

42:20.123 --> 42:22.436
[soft music]

42:22.540 --> 42:24.887
Well, you know I'm here for you,
don't you?

42:24.990 --> 42:25.922
Thanks.

42:26.026 --> 42:28.338
[waves crashing]

42:30.824 --> 42:32.722
It was a nice surprise
to get your call.

42:32.826 --> 42:35.000
- What do you wanna do--
- You lied to me.

42:35.104 --> 42:37.727
The man you were talking to,
he works for the council.

42:37.831 --> 42:40.592
Our rent lease's in
Malky's name. It has been.

42:40.696 --> 42:43.077
It has been since you left.

42:43.181 --> 42:44.700
Are you trying to take it
from him?

42:44.803 --> 42:47.357
Oh, my God,
is that what you think?

42:47.461 --> 42:50.084
No! Fergus, no.
I would never.

42:50.188 --> 42:51.603
So why lie?

42:52.293 --> 42:54.019
It wasn't a lie,

42:54.123 --> 42:56.366
I just wanted to keep it
a secret until it was sorted.

42:56.470 --> 42:58.506
Till what's sorted?

42:58.610 --> 42:59.818
I'm buying the house.

42:59.922 --> 43:01.579
Yeah, from under Malky.

43:03.339 --> 43:05.134
No, I'm buying the house
for you!

43:05.237 --> 43:07.757
It'll be under Malky's name
until you turn eighteen

43:07.861 --> 43:10.311
but then it's all yours.

43:11.865 --> 43:13.591
It's the least I can do.

43:13.694 --> 43:16.041
[soft music]

43:20.563 --> 43:22.323
I'm here to make things right,
Fergus.

43:23.531 --> 43:24.912
[Fergus breathes sharply]

43:26.431 --> 43:28.916
Er, okay.

43:29.020 --> 43:30.262
Yeah?

43:31.125 --> 43:33.369
I mean, that, that, that's good.

43:33.472 --> 43:34.957
[both laugh]

43:35.060 --> 43:36.027
I guess.

43:36.130 --> 43:37.994
[both laughing]

43:43.137 --> 43:45.381
[theme music]

44:18.932 --> 44:21.382
[music continues]
