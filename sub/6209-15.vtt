Yes. And you're wearing
a very nice spring outfit.

Ah. The only thing that's missing is:

The last time I wore mittens,
everybody teased me.

- It almost ruined kindergarten for me.
- Sabrina, there's a finger-flu alert.

you're highly susceptible to it.

Sure.

What's with the mittens? Eczema?

01:33.465 --> 01:35.009
No. I promised my aunts
I'd wear them,

I think there are laws.

I put my idea for a town meeting
on Mrs. Quick's desk.

Oh, no. The person you want to read it
will actually read it?

So you see what
an awful situation it is.

that has to work up to low self-esteem.

The other day I saw this book called

02:46.079 --> 02:47.408

Uh-oh. Whenever Mr. Kraft
makes an announcement

and get us all in trouble.
