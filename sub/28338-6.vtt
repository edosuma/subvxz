[trills tongue]

00:11.333 --> 00:13.373
That's my boy!

00:13.373 --> 00:15.333
[Exasperella]
That's my nephew!

00:15.333 --> 00:18.293
I'm not related to him.

00:18.293 --> 00:20.373
Excuse me, miss.

00:20.373 --> 00:21.503
Couldn't help but notice

00:21.503 --> 00:24.453
that that lava suit
really suits you.

00:24.453 --> 00:25.753
Well, you don't
look so bad

00:25.753 --> 00:27.503
yourself, stranger.

00:27.503 --> 00:29.083
Well, maybe
a little bit bad.

00:29.083 --> 00:31.123
-Roar!
-Last one ashore

00:31.123 --> 00:32.503
is a rotten
gargoyle egg!

00:32.503 --> 00:33.873
Oh, no, ya don't!

00:33.873 --> 00:35.503
Oh, thanks, Tom.

00:35.503 --> 00:36.873
That was so much fun!

00:36.873 --> 00:37.873
But I gotta boogie.

00:37.873 --> 00:39.373
Aw, you leaving already?

00:39.373 --> 00:42.833
That party's just
getting started!

00:42.833 --> 00:45.583
Thank you so much for the
wonderful day, everyone.

00:45.583 --> 00:47.003
Lord and Lady Lucitor,

00:47.003 --> 00:48.793
it was a pleasure
to see you again.

00:48.793 --> 00:51.373
Yeah, well, some of us
are pretty hard to miss.

00:51.373 --> 00:53.453
[Lady Lucitor chuckles]

00:53.453 --> 00:55.503
And Gloominus,
Exasperella,

00:55.503 --> 00:56.873
wonderful meeting you both.

00:56.873 --> 00:59.253
Well, it was
a pleasure, dearie.

00:59.253 --> 01:03.003
You know, I was a mean
tap dancer 20 years ago.

01:05.753 --> 01:08.503
Wait, Star, so,
where are you going?

01:08.503 --> 01:10.003
I gotta help Marco

01:10.003 --> 01:11.793
make dinner
for his family.

01:11.793 --> 01:15.373
Or you could stay.

01:15.373 --> 01:16.793
I'm sorry, Tom,

01:16.793 --> 01:19.213
but I promised Marco
I'd be there.

01:19.213 --> 01:21.413
-You understand.
-[thunder crashes]

01:21.413 --> 01:25.373
[thunder crashing]

01:25.373 --> 01:28.453
Uh-oh, one of our
nasty storms
is rolling in.

01:28.453 --> 01:31.083
It looks like it might not
be safe to travel, Star.

01:31.083 --> 01:33.163
Guess you'll just
have to stay here with us

01:33.163 --> 01:34.293
till it blows over.

01:34.293 --> 01:36.413
What? No.
I'm not gonna let

01:36.413 --> 01:38.503
a little drizzle
get in my way.

01:38.503 --> 01:40.163
See ya later, handsome!

-[Tom grunts]

01:43.833 --> 01:45.213
You okay?

01:45.213 --> 01:46.623
I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:46.623 --> 01:48.503
-Maybe I should--
-[Cloudy] Aah!

01:48.503 --> 01:50.913
-Maybe I should--
-[Cloudy screaming]

01:50.913 --> 01:52.453
-Maybe I should--
-[Cloudy] Aah!

01:52.453 --> 01:54.333
Maybe you should
come inside!

01:54.333 --> 01:56.413
[thunder crashes]

01:56.413 --> 01:57.663
You okay, Star?

01:57.663 --> 01:58.793
That was a close call.

01:58.793 --> 02:00.413
Yeah, I'm fine,

02:00.413 --> 02:02.253
but my dinner
with Marco--

02:02.253 --> 02:03.623
How long is this
gonna last?

02:03.623 --> 02:05.043
-[thunder crashes]
-[Star shrieks]

02:05.043 --> 02:06.793
[chuckles nervously]
Hi.

02:06.793 --> 02:09.663
Yeah, this one
looks pretty bad.

02:09.663 --> 02:11.583
We might be stuck here
for a while.

02:11.583 --> 02:13.043
-[all groan]
-[Tom] No way!

02:13.043 --> 02:14.333
I'm gonna miss out
on all those

02:14.333 --> 02:15.793
gnarly pounders!

02:15.793 --> 02:17.543
Why did I even
bring my surfboard?

02:17.543 --> 02:18.913
How do you think
I feel?

02:18.913 --> 02:20.583
Cooped up with
my weird boyfriend

02:20.583 --> 02:22.623
and my gigantic
little sister?

02:22.623 --> 02:24.543
[low growling]

02:24.543 --> 02:26.453
I like pickles okay,

02:26.453 --> 02:29.453
but I can't stand
cucumbers.

02:29.453 --> 02:31.833
Well, thank you,
Mr. Personality.

02:31.833 --> 02:34.253
Well, it has been forever

02:34.253 --> 02:36.663
since I got to hang
with the Lucitor family.

02:36.663 --> 02:39.583
[laughs]
Family bonding!

02:39.583 --> 02:40.953
[thunder crashes]

02:42.163 --> 02:45.083
H-U-R, "Sulphur."

02:45.083 --> 02:46.583
That's 30 points.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.453
Oh, nice one,
Exasperella.

02:48.453 --> 02:50.543
[painting shrieks]

02:50.543 --> 02:51.663
What the heck
was that?

02:51.663 --> 02:53.123
Oh, that's
just a painting

02:53.123 --> 02:54.623
of my great
grandfather, Relicor.

02:54.623 --> 02:56.123
[thunder crashes]

02:56.123 --> 02:58.213
He was quite
the lady killer.

02:58.213 --> 03:01.713
[chuckles] Uh...

03:01.713 --> 03:03.213
So, what's with all
the shrieky business?

03:03.213 --> 03:05.213
Oh, he just wants to
join us for Drabble.

03:05.213 --> 03:06.873
[Tom] It's his
favorite game.

03:06.873 --> 03:08.373
[thunder crashes]

03:08.373 --> 03:10.913
[shrieks]

03:10.913 --> 03:13.213
Watch out, he cheats.

03:13.213 --> 03:15.953
[muttering vocalization]

03:15.953 --> 03:17.713
Oh, good idea,
Honeybunch.

03:17.713 --> 03:19.123
What did she say?

03:19.123 --> 03:20.873
Oh, she said
that she wanted to

03:20.873 --> 03:22.663
mix up some
refreshing demonade.

03:22.663 --> 03:24.043
Oh, none for me, thanks.

03:24.043 --> 03:25.623
I never touch
the stuff.

03:25.623 --> 03:27.503
[squelch, slurps]

03:27.503 --> 03:30.293
You know, the thing
about demonade is that--

03:30.293 --> 03:32.293
Well, I'll go give
Wrathmelior a hand.

03:32.293 --> 03:35.123
It's been a while since
we had any one-on-one time.

03:35.123 --> 03:37.503
[flutters, shrieks]

03:38.543 --> 03:40.163
Hey, Wrath.

03:40.163 --> 03:41.413
I thought you could
use some help.

03:41.413 --> 03:42.663
I figured
it's been a while

03:42.663 --> 03:44.043
since we got to hang.

03:44.043 --> 03:46.163
You know, get in
some female bonding.

03:46.163 --> 03:47.953
So, put me to work.
What can I do?

03:51.003 --> 03:53.003
She always like this
when she's cooking?

03:53.003 --> 03:55.043
[shrieks]

03:55.043 --> 03:57.953
[vocalizing]

03:57.953 --> 04:00.373
Oh! Demon fruit

04:00.373 --> 04:02.583
goes in the
demon blender.

04:02.583 --> 04:04.373
Uh-d'oy! Got it.

04:04.373 --> 04:06.543
So, this is some
crazy weather

04:06.543 --> 04:08.163
we're having,
isn't it?

04:08.163 --> 04:11.253
On Earth, Marco says
it rains cats and dogs,

04:11.253 --> 04:14.213
but I've never actually
seen any, so... [laughs]

04:14.213 --> 04:16.213
-[Wrathmelior huffs]
-What's new with you?

04:16.213 --> 04:17.753
Bet you've been
pretty busy.

04:17.753 --> 04:19.953
Uh, y-you-- you
kind of overfilled!

04:19.953 --> 04:22.503
I know I have.
[shrieks] Oh!

04:22.503 --> 04:25.083
[demonfruit laughs]

04:25.083 --> 04:28.213
[demonfruit laughing]

04:29.453 --> 04:31.793
Whoo! All right,
Wrathmelior,

04:31.793 --> 04:34.043
you get the blender,
I'll take care of
these little creeps.

04:34.043 --> 04:35.623
[demonfruit yelling]

04:35.623 --> 04:36.753
Come back here,
you little...

04:36.753 --> 04:38.503

-[demonfruit scatting]
-[Star] Yah!

04:43.123 --> 04:44.833
[grunts] Hi-yah!

04:44.833 --> 04:46.503
Now come on out!

04:46.503 --> 04:48.123
-[demonfruit laughing]
-[Star screams]

04:48.123 --> 04:50.123
Wrathmelior, I need you!

04:50.123 --> 04:51.413
[trills]

04:54.043 --> 04:55.953
[Star] Wow, we make

04:55.953 --> 04:58.333
a pretty good
team, don't we?

04:58.333 --> 04:59.663
High five, girlfriend.

05:06.793 --> 05:09.753
Uh, she left me hangin'.

05:09.753 --> 05:11.713
[Relicor shrieks]

05:11.713 --> 05:12.833
What happened here?

05:12.833 --> 05:15.333
Oh, there was
a disagreement.

05:15.333 --> 05:17.753
[Relicor shrieks]

05:17.753 --> 05:21.123
"Milkshake" is totally
a word, Relicor!

05:21.123 --> 05:23.123
Hey! What's this?

05:23.123 --> 05:24.913
Is this a family
photo album?

05:24.913 --> 05:28.753
Oh, this will be
so much fun!

05:28.753 --> 05:31.753
[happy growling]

05:33.713 --> 05:34.953
Hey, Tom, can we talk
just a second?

05:34.953 --> 05:36.833
I know, I know,
I know, sorry.

05:36.833 --> 05:38.413
Our Drabble games
can get pretty heated.

05:38.413 --> 05:39.793
No, no, no, no, no.
It isn't that.

05:39.793 --> 05:41.003
Although, that
was really scary.

05:41.003 --> 05:42.503
We'll have
a conversation later.

05:42.503 --> 05:44.713
Earlier, in the kitchen,
your mom seemed upset,

05:44.713 --> 05:45.913
and when I went
to high five her,

05:45.913 --> 05:47.503
she totally
left me hangin'.

05:47.503 --> 05:50.583
Star, the woman's name
is Wrathmelior.

05:50.583 --> 05:51.873
She's always upset
about something.

05:51.873 --> 05:53.003
Come on, let's go look at

05:53.003 --> 05:54.953
some embarrassing
family photos.

05:54.953 --> 05:57.123
[Tom]
Oh, come on, Mom!

05:57.123 --> 05:59.793
You just had to start
with that one.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.793
Oh, Tom!

06:01.793 --> 06:03.293
Well, you were
just the sweetest

06:03.293 --> 06:06.503
-little baldy bear!
-[gibbers]

06:06.503 --> 06:08.163
[Wrathmelior trills]

06:08.163 --> 06:10.873
[Tom]
Little Lord Fool-leroy!

06:10.873 --> 06:14.663
[gibbers a lullaby]

06:14.663 --> 06:16.713
[gasps] And who is
this young couple?

06:16.713 --> 06:19.913
[Star] Oh!
The Silver Bell ball!

06:19.913 --> 06:21.543
Oh, here we go.

06:21.543 --> 06:23.373
The Star and Tom section.

06:23.373 --> 06:25.543
[Star] Oh, when
I got my horns.

06:25.543 --> 06:26.913
[Tom] You mean
our second date?

06:26.913 --> 06:29.293
[huffing]

06:29.293 --> 06:30.623
Wait a minute,
Tom, you were

06:30.623 --> 06:31.713
at my going-away party?

06:31.713 --> 06:33.623
Why don't I remember that?

06:33.623 --> 06:35.413
Oh, my gosh, is that
when you and me had our--

06:36.413 --> 06:38.163
Oh! Your carriage!

06:38.163 --> 06:40.253
You took me to
the Blood Moon ball
in that.

06:40.253 --> 06:42.753
[Tom] Yeah, that thing
took forever to put together.

06:42.753 --> 06:44.793
Wait, you built
that crazy thing?

06:44.793 --> 06:46.793
Well, I-- I made it,

06:46.793 --> 06:49.713
so-- so I could drive you
to the Blood Moon ball,

06:49.713 --> 06:52.833
but it didn't really go
as planned, I guess.

06:52.833 --> 06:54.543
-[sighs, grumbles]
-[thunder crashes]

06:54.543 --> 06:55.793
[Wrathmelior cries]

06:55.793 --> 06:58.543
[sighs] She's--
You know, memories

06:58.543 --> 07:01.213
just get her
all misty-eyed.

07:01.213 --> 07:03.373
Honey? Honey!

07:03.373 --> 07:04.833
Maybe that's
enough of this.

07:07.873 --> 07:10.453
Okay, whatever
your mom's mad about,

07:10.453 --> 07:12.453
it's definitely
something I did.

07:12.453 --> 07:14.793
Well, she likes you,
but I think

07:14.793 --> 07:16.953
she's concerned
you might hurt me again.

07:16.953 --> 07:19.163
Wait, why?
Just because we broke up?

07:19.163 --> 07:21.333
Everybody breaks up.
That's what teenagers do.

07:21.333 --> 07:22.583
Teenagers are dumb!

07:22.583 --> 07:24.003
Oh, I know, I know.

07:24.003 --> 07:25.953
I had issues
I had to deal with.

07:25.953 --> 07:27.793
Okay. Well, then,
what is going on?

07:27.793 --> 07:32.793
Well, it might be
because you kissed Marco.

07:32.793 --> 07:34.793
You knew about that?

07:36.373 --> 07:38.373
And you didn't say anything?

07:38.373 --> 07:40.293
Oh, no, I know it
wasn't on purpose.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.213
It-- It was
an unusual situation.

07:42.213 --> 07:44.583
You know, with that weird
photo booth guy and all.

07:44.583 --> 07:47.663
But you told your mom,
and you didn't tell me?

07:47.663 --> 07:49.913
You're not supposed to be angry.

07:49.913 --> 07:50.793
I am.

07:50.793 --> 07:52.543
If I had kissed Marco,

07:52.543 --> 07:54.333
wouldn't you want me
to tell you?

07:54.333 --> 07:56.333
Well, I don't know.
Yeah, yeah. I guess.

07:56.333 --> 07:58.713
But you didn't tell me.

08:00.543 --> 08:02.083
I gotta go.

08:02.083 --> 08:04.083
[rain pouring, thunder crashes]

08:04.083 --> 08:06.913
Star! I know
it didn't mean anything!

08:06.913 --> 08:09.623
But that doesn't mean
I didn't wanna talk about it.

08:09.623 --> 08:11.503
So, I talked
with my mom.

08:11.503 --> 08:12.913
[vocalizing]

08:12.913 --> 08:15.663
Let's-- Let's just
go inside, okay?

08:15.663 --> 08:16.873
Tom!

08:16.873 --> 08:18.213
[gasping]

08:18.213 --> 08:19.913
Whoa! Whoa!

08:19.913 --> 08:21.793
Aah!

08:21.793 --> 08:23.413
Oh, no. I'm coming!

08:23.413 --> 08:25.543
[Star panting, grunts]
