WEBVTT

00:02.661 --> 00:05.653
And just how much of this
future champion do we own?

00:05.731 --> 00:06.959
60%.

00:07.032 --> 00:09.466
And you go down
in the Dixie Joe fight.

00:09.534 --> 00:12.731
You go down, he collects
a fortune and goes into
the drug business.

00:12.971 --> 00:14.802
Teach this clown
some manners.

00:16.842 --> 00:18.036
Hit it, B.A.

00:18.243 --> 00:19.642
[gun firing]

00:19.711 --> 00:21.576
We're gonna use
ring psychology on this guy.

00:21.646 --> 00:23.011
Shut up, fool!
l know what l'm doing!

00:23.081 --> 00:24.480
[people cheering]

00:27.119 --> 00:28.711
Ten. You're out.

00:28.787 --> 00:31.722
You better hurry down here,
or you're gonna miss
all the fun.

00:33.692 --> 00:36.092
(male narrator)
In 1972,
a crack commando unit...

00:36.161 --> 00:37.788
was sent to prison
by a military court...

00:37.863 --> 00:39.330
for a crime
they didn't commit.

00:39.397 --> 00:40.694
These men promptly escaped...

00:40.766 --> 00:42.393
from a maximum-security
stockade...

00:42.467 --> 00:43.934
to the Los Angeles
underground.

00:44.136 --> 00:45.660
Today, still wanted
by the government...

00:45.737 --> 00:47.671
they survive
as soldiers of fortune.

00:47.773 --> 00:50.207
If you have a problem,
if no one else can help...

00:50.275 --> 00:51.503
and if you can find them...

00:51.576 --> 00:53.771
maybe you can hire
the A-Team.

02:22.701 --> 02:25.932
Our man trains here?
Willie Riggs' place?

02:26.004 --> 02:28.063
And what's wrong with
Willie Riggs' place?

02:28.173 --> 02:30.266
A lot of good fighters came
out of there, you know.

02:30.342 --> 02:33.709
Yeah. Spider Kelsey,
Hurricane Johnny Corso...

02:33.778 --> 02:35.405
''Glass Jaw'' Hendrix.

02:35.513 --> 02:37.276
(Hannibal)
B.A., l never heard of
those fighters.

02:37.349 --> 02:40.045
(B.A.)
Exactly. Man trains nothing
but losers.

02:44.589 --> 02:47.080
(Face)
l'm telling you, Hannibal,
you gotta see this guy.

02:47.158 --> 02:50.855
He's got it all.
He's got terrific hand speed,
great reflexes...

02:50.996 --> 02:54.591
and a chin. A bulldozer
couldn't knock this guy out.

02:54.666 --> 02:57.294
And just how much of this
future champion do we own?

02:57.369 --> 02:58.768
60%.

02:58.837 --> 03:00.566
The other 40% is owned by
a syndicate.

03:00.639 --> 03:01.697
Trust me, Hannibal.

03:01.773 --> 03:04.571
When you see
Billy Marquette's left jab,
you're gonna thank me.

03:04.709 --> 03:06.472
He's gonna make us a fortune!

03:07.779 --> 03:10.441
Look, Face, we work hard
for our money, man.

03:10.515 --> 03:12.710
We don't wanna be investing
our money in some boxer.

03:12.817 --> 03:15.342
We should invest our money
in something safe...

03:15.453 --> 03:16.613
like gold.

03:16.688 --> 03:20.647
Which happens to be falling on
the London market at this very
moment, thank you very much.

03:20.725 --> 03:22.852
lf this guy is as good
as Faceman says he is...

03:22.928 --> 03:26.056
this could be mucho-gucho
ravioli, pal.

03:26.531 --> 03:28.021
And l can see it now.

03:28.099 --> 03:30.693
The big fella, he moves in
on Kid Marquette.

03:30.769 --> 03:32.999
He's moving in and gets it
with a hard right!

03:33.071 --> 03:35.505
A flurry of punches drives him
up against the ropes!

03:35.573 --> 03:37.734
And an uppercut sends him
down on the canvas!

03:37.876 --> 03:39.400
He's out!

03:40.278 --> 03:43.145
lt's nice to have one vote of
confidence around here.

03:43.748 --> 03:45.181
Smell that, B.A.?

03:45.250 --> 03:48.811
Can you smell it?
How it hangs thick in the air?

03:48.887 --> 03:51.981
That is the scent
of past glory...

03:52.157 --> 03:55.024
of victory,
and it's symbolized by guts...

03:55.260 --> 03:57.091
determination and the will
to win!

03:57.495 --> 03:59.360
Don't smell like nothing
but sweat to me!

03:59.431 --> 04:02.195
(Willie)
No. You're not getting off
quick enough!

04:02.567 --> 04:06.663
Use the jab, the jab,
and then right with the hook!
Come on!

04:06.738 --> 04:09.605
And don't let him
counterpunch you! Come on!
Get in there!

04:10.241 --> 04:12.209
We'd like to talk to
Billy Marquette.

04:12.744 --> 04:14.041
Yeah,
who wants to know?

04:16.214 --> 04:17.408
Holy gee!

04:17.682 --> 04:20.014
Hey, fella,
you wanna train?

04:20.317 --> 04:23.583
Hey, you take a punch and l
get you a quick
eight-rounder tomorrow night.

04:23.655 --> 04:24.781
What do you say?

04:24.856 --> 04:26.221
Hey, sucker,
you hard of hearing?

04:26.291 --> 04:28.691
The man asked you
where's Billy Marquette?

04:30.328 --> 04:31.727
Try the locker room.

04:31.796 --> 04:33.627
[grunting]

04:34.799 --> 04:36.767
You don't listen too good,
do you, Billy?

04:36.835 --> 04:38.826
So now we gotta do things
the hard way.

04:41.306 --> 04:43.501
l never took
a dive in my life.

04:44.275 --> 04:45.833
You tell Monroe that.

04:46.044 --> 04:47.636
[groaning]

04:47.712 --> 04:49.839
You're a real saint,
aren't you?

04:50.015 --> 04:51.209
But like they say...

04:51.516 --> 04:53.484
there's always
a first time for everything.

04:53.585 --> 04:54.574
[panting]

04:54.652 --> 04:57.314
And you go down
in the Dixie Joe fight.

04:57.389 --> 04:58.822
lt'd be a real shame...

04:58.890 --> 05:01.950
if all of a sudden
that cute little kid sister
of yours, Tina...

05:02.027 --> 05:04.222
happens to get into
an accident...

05:04.295 --> 05:06.889
because her brother was
hard of hearing.

05:09.034 --> 05:11.025
Know what l mean?

05:12.637 --> 05:14.195
[man chattering]

05:15.807 --> 05:17.206
[woman screaming]

05:18.676 --> 05:19.870
Billy!

05:22.147 --> 05:23.273
Are you okay?

05:27.786 --> 05:29.014
(Tina)
Oh, God!

05:37.195 --> 05:38.457
Who are
those guys?

05:38.596 --> 05:39.563
What guys?

05:39.664 --> 05:42.497
What are you talking about?
Those guys who just drove off
in the car.

05:42.567 --> 05:43.932
Tina, drop it.

05:44.002 --> 05:45.867
l think the lady's
trying to help, pal.

05:45.970 --> 05:47.369
The lady is my sister...

05:47.439 --> 05:48.531
and it's none of
your business.

05:48.606 --> 05:49.971
lt is our business.

05:50.075 --> 05:53.602
Face, are you telling me
that...

05:53.845 --> 05:55.278
this is our fighter?

05:55.346 --> 05:58.645
Yeah. Oh, l mean he was
outnumbered here.

05:58.783 --> 06:00.944
This is the guy we got
60% of?

06:01.019 --> 06:02.316
That's right.

06:02.420 --> 06:04.354
Hi, how you doing?
l'm Templeton Peck.

06:04.422 --> 06:07.619
Well, actually, my friends
call me Face, but....

06:07.892 --> 06:09.382
[stammering]

06:16.434 --> 06:18.368
You wanna tell us
why those guys down there...

06:18.436 --> 06:20.301
were using you
like a punching bag?

06:22.240 --> 06:24.401
Why don't you guys
just leave, huh?

06:24.476 --> 06:26.273
Can't. 60%, remember?

06:26.344 --> 06:29.575
Well, sell out because
it's a bad investment.

06:29.681 --> 06:32.809
l don't know, Faceman,
sounds like we might have
a real problem here.

06:32.884 --> 06:35.682
l want you on the next flight
back home to Minnesota.

06:40.425 --> 06:42.416
l've never seen him
act like this.

06:42.494 --> 06:44.928
Did you recognize any of
the men that were in that car?

06:44.996 --> 06:47.328
No. l really didn't get
a good look at them.

06:47.532 --> 06:49.432
My brother's been uptight
lately, but...

06:49.501 --> 06:52.629
l thought he was just nervous
about the upcoming
Dixie Joe fight.

06:52.937 --> 06:56.270
lt's the biggest fight
of Billy's career,
but now this....

06:56.407 --> 06:58.375
Man can't fight
if he's in trouble.

06:58.676 --> 07:00.473
He might get himself
knocked out.

07:01.045 --> 07:03.570
l don't know who you are,
but my brother needs help.

07:04.249 --> 07:07.184
You own a piece of
his contract.
Maybe you can do something.

07:08.920 --> 07:10.319
Well, she's got a point,
Hannibal.

07:10.388 --> 07:12.413
l mean, the first rule
of good money management...

07:12.490 --> 07:14.515
is always protect
your investment.

07:14.592 --> 07:15.786
Yeah.

07:18.129 --> 07:20.927
l was just waiting
at a stop sign
and this guy rear-ended me.

07:20.999 --> 07:22.432
l mean, l didn't even....

07:23.001 --> 07:25.902
You don't think my insurance
policy's gonna go up, do you?

07:26.171 --> 07:28.435
Oh, you got it?
Go ahead.

07:30.241 --> 07:31.674
Right.

07:32.544 --> 07:35.980
Oh, thank you very much.
l really appreciate this.
Yeah.

07:36.414 --> 07:39.144
Oh yeah. l'll contact
my insurance company
right away.

07:39.217 --> 07:40.946
You bet. Thanks.

07:42.120 --> 07:43.951
Three cherries.

07:47.592 --> 07:52.120
Well, the car is registered
to Ringside Enterprises...

07:52.197 --> 07:54.290
owned and operated by
a Sonny Monroe.

07:54.432 --> 07:55.626
Sonny Monroe?

07:55.700 --> 07:58.999
He heads the syndicate
that owns the other 40%
of Billy's contract.

07:59.437 --> 08:00.961
Well,
isn't that interesting?

08:01.539 --> 08:03.769
You got any idea
where Monroe hangs out?

08:04.042 --> 08:07.671
You can usually find him
having lunch over at
Dino's Clam Bar on Lincoln.

08:26.397 --> 08:28.058
[[[singing gibberish]

08:31.936 --> 08:35.530
[in fake accent]
Say everybody! Attention.
Clam man! Clam man!

08:35.607 --> 08:38.576
Here, get your clams!
Hey! Somebody...

08:38.643 --> 08:41.407
bring me some more of
those cherrystone clams.

08:41.479 --> 08:44.744
Hold the little necks!
And bring me some ice.
What, are you crazy?

08:45.817 --> 08:47.717
Who are you?
What are you doing?

08:47.785 --> 08:49.685
What am l doing? What does it
look like l'm doing?

08:49.754 --> 08:52.723
l'm shucking clams, man!
You ain't never seen that?

08:52.790 --> 08:55.224
You can't do that!
What do you mean,
l can't do that?

08:55.293 --> 08:56.624
Look at this,
l need more ice!

08:56.694 --> 09:00.095
l got to have something else
besides this stuff.
What's going on here?

09:00.198 --> 09:02.860
You know what l'm talking
about, pal? What are you
doing there?

09:02.934 --> 09:06.267
Get away from there!
Get going, put this back, man!

09:06.337 --> 09:07.736
Give me this clams here.

09:07.805 --> 09:12.242
What are you doing? Hey!
Come back here with those!
What are you doing there?

09:17.482 --> 09:18.710
[[[music playing]

09:21.019 --> 09:23.078
l didn't order clams.
l ordered calamari.

09:23.154 --> 09:24.382
Calamari, right.

09:29.294 --> 09:30.522
l'm a little concerned.

09:30.595 --> 09:33.826
Maybe our fighter,
Billy Marquette,
didn't quite get the message.

09:34.265 --> 09:36.358
He seems to be training
a little too hard.

09:36.434 --> 09:37.992
Hey, we got it across to him.

09:38.770 --> 09:41.364
l typed it on his ribs,
personally.

09:41.773 --> 09:43.798
Maybe he should be
reminded again.

09:44.475 --> 09:45.942
Doesn't he have a sister?

09:46.244 --> 09:47.506
Yeah.

09:47.912 --> 09:49.743
Maybe we should
break her arm, huh?

09:49.881 --> 09:53.214
Just to make sure
Billy boy knows
we're not blowing smoke.

09:53.818 --> 09:55.809
(Monroe)
Okay, the coke's
coming into Carrenza...

09:55.887 --> 09:57.377
in the next few weeks.

09:57.455 --> 10:00.515
The money we'll make
from betting on the fight
will cover all of it.

10:00.591 --> 10:02.889
I just don't want nothin'
to go wrong.

10:03.361 --> 10:06.489
I wanna make sure the kid's
gonna play along just like
he's supposed to.

10:07.398 --> 10:09.332
Let's hit his training camp
this afternoon.

10:09.534 --> 10:11.798
I mean, I do own 40% of him,
right?

10:12.136 --> 10:15.037
Drugs and money,
these guys are all the same.

10:15.473 --> 10:16.963
Billy, you gotta let us
help you.

10:17.041 --> 10:19.703
And we're not just talking
about your sister
getting hurt...

10:19.777 --> 10:21.836
we're talking about drugs
coming onto the streets...

10:21.913 --> 10:23.244
and a lot of people
getting hurt.

10:23.314 --> 10:25.714
lt's not just a matter of
taking Monroe off the board.

10:25.783 --> 10:27.478
lf we're gonna stop
this drug deal...

10:27.552 --> 10:29.383
first of all we have to
find out when...

10:29.454 --> 10:30.887
and where
it's going down.

10:30.955 --> 10:32.445
Billy,
listen to them.

10:33.024 --> 10:36.482
There's too much at stake here
for you to try to take on
Monroe alone.

10:41.799 --> 10:44.893
Monroe's pressuring me to take
a dive in the Dixie Joe fight.

10:44.969 --> 10:46.834
He knows l'll be going in
a heavy favorite.

10:47.038 --> 10:51.532
So Monroe gets long odds,
he lays down a bundle
on Dixie Joe...

10:51.776 --> 10:55.075
you go down, he collects
a fortune and goes into
the drug business.

10:55.213 --> 10:56.271
Yeah.

10:56.381 --> 11:00.647
A dive. l mean,
corrupting the noble
and manly art of the jab.

11:00.718 --> 11:03.084
That is the lowest thing
l've ever heard of.

11:03.488 --> 11:05.046
You got a plan, Hannibal?

11:05.123 --> 11:08.320
Of course l do.
And it's flawless.

11:08.826 --> 11:10.521
Flawless.
Sure.

11:10.795 --> 11:12.228
And Monroe's gotta
come down here...

11:12.296 --> 11:15.129
to watch Billy do a couple
of rounds with
a sparring partner, right?

11:15.199 --> 11:16.530
Right.
Well...

11:16.601 --> 11:18.466
then all we have to do...

11:18.536 --> 11:20.936
is show him
how hard a jaw...

11:21.005 --> 11:22.438
B.A. has.

11:22.573 --> 11:23.562
[grunting]

11:25.343 --> 11:27.004
That's it, kid,
that's it.

11:27.078 --> 11:29.512
Keep the rhythm going.
Pace yourself.

11:30.114 --> 11:32.412
You look great.
You're looking great, Billy.

11:32.483 --> 11:35.418
Get your weight behind
each punch. Come on.

11:37.121 --> 11:38.520
(Willie)
Pace yourself.

11:40.625 --> 11:42.752
[Billy grunting]

11:51.769 --> 11:53.430
Looking good, kid.

11:55.706 --> 11:59.107
You keep this up,
you'll make hamburger meat
out of Dixie Joe.

12:01.446 --> 12:03.676
Yeah. You're right about
one thing, Monroe.

12:03.748 --> 12:06.512
My brother's gonna turn
Dixie Joe into hash.

12:15.493 --> 12:16.687
Who's he sparring with?

12:16.761 --> 12:17.955
Some new guy.

12:40.585 --> 12:42.018
[both grunting]

12:45.623 --> 12:46.988
The guy's good.
Who is he?

12:47.058 --> 12:48.389
l don't know.

12:55.366 --> 12:56.355
[groaning]

12:58.970 --> 13:00.198
What's wrong?

13:01.105 --> 13:03.539
l don't know.
l felt something pop.

13:03.908 --> 13:05.239
l think it's broken.

13:10.181 --> 13:11.944
Can you move your fingers?
No.

13:12.783 --> 13:14.546
Wait a minute, wait.

13:16.053 --> 13:17.418
What's the matter?

13:17.488 --> 13:21.117
l think he busted his hand.
Somebody call an ambulance!

13:36.040 --> 13:38.372
Okay, get him inside.

14:08.773 --> 14:12.402
lf that bum soured
our deal here, kill him.

14:22.186 --> 14:23.983
(Tina)
Everything will work
itself out.

14:24.055 --> 14:27.218
(Billy)
l don't know. l wish l could
be as sure as you are.

14:27.291 --> 14:28.986
l wanna talk
to your brother here.

14:29.060 --> 14:31.824
Why don't you go out and
powder your nose or something?
Don't!

14:31.896 --> 14:33.193
l'll wait outside.

14:35.166 --> 14:37.293
ls this some kind of
cute trick?

14:37.702 --> 14:39.727
You think l wanted
to bust my hand?

14:39.804 --> 14:42.170
How was l supposed to know
hitting that guy
will be like...

14:42.239 --> 14:44.503
slamming my hand
against a brick wall.

14:45.910 --> 14:48.902
They say he killed
a couple of guys in the ring
down in Florida.

14:50.014 --> 14:51.481
By the way he hits...

14:52.149 --> 14:53.480
l can believe it.

14:53.818 --> 14:55.843
l got too much riding
on this fight.

14:55.953 --> 14:57.648
l need you
in that ring now!

14:58.222 --> 15:00.782
Well, l'm afraid
that's out of the question.

15:01.525 --> 15:02.890
Not with this hand.

15:03.427 --> 15:04.689
Now, if you will.

15:04.762 --> 15:05.751
[clears throat]

15:06.797 --> 15:09.027
As you can see, yes...

15:09.200 --> 15:12.294
Mr. Marquette has suffered
a hairline fracture...

15:12.370 --> 15:15.703
of the flexor pollicis
metacarpal bone there.

15:15.906 --> 15:18.807
See, you can just make out
the fracture between
the brevis diciti...

15:18.876 --> 15:20.605
and the minimi radialis.

15:20.678 --> 15:22.145
Now, l am sorry...

15:22.213 --> 15:25.341
but, the human hand
simply is not designed...

15:25.416 --> 15:27.907
to come into contact
with immovable objects.

15:27.985 --> 15:31.352
Okay, so how long does it take
for something like
this pollis--

15:31.422 --> 15:34.619
Flexor pollicis metacarpal.

15:34.692 --> 15:35.659
Yeah, to heal?

15:35.726 --> 15:38.695
Well, l'd say
at least six weeks.

15:38.763 --> 15:41.061
Six weeks? l need him
in the ring in a month!

15:41.132 --> 15:43.930
Well, l suggest
you find yourself
another pugilist.

15:44.001 --> 15:48.028
Mr. Marquette here
must forego fisticuffs
for at least six weeks...

15:48.105 --> 15:49.970
and in my medical opinion...

15:50.174 --> 15:54.008
l suggest, to be
on the safe side,
that you make it eight.

15:54.545 --> 15:58.709
Now, if you gentlemen
will excuse me,
l have my rounds to make.

15:59.884 --> 16:01.647
Get it?
''Rounds to make?''

16:04.288 --> 16:05.653
[sighing]
Well....

16:09.260 --> 16:11.854
That guy you sparred with,
what's his name?

16:12.329 --> 16:13.523
Volcano Johnson.

16:13.864 --> 16:15.559
Johnson, yeah.
Who manages him?

16:15.966 --> 16:19.197
A guy named Jimmy Pearl.
You don't wanna mess
with Jimmy Pearl.

16:19.336 --> 16:21.861
He's into some
real heavy action.

16:22.673 --> 16:23.935
Oh, yeah?

16:26.877 --> 16:28.936
Hey, this ain't our car.

16:34.218 --> 16:35.981
You Pearl?
Yeah.

16:36.053 --> 16:37.418
Sonny Monroe.

16:37.755 --> 16:39.154
l think
you and l gotta talk.

16:39.223 --> 16:41.453
Well, we got nothing
to talk about, chum.

16:41.525 --> 16:43.220
l mean,
look at that jacket.

16:43.961 --> 16:45.360
l'd let you
talk to my tailor...

16:45.429 --> 16:49.126
but he likes a little class,
you know what l mean?

16:49.433 --> 16:51.025
Let me tell you
something, Jack.

16:51.135 --> 16:53.626
Your boy here busted up
my boy's hand.

16:53.704 --> 16:55.763
He ain't gonna make
the Dixie Joe fight.

16:56.107 --> 16:59.167
l think maybe we can
work something out
with Johnson here.

16:59.243 --> 17:00.471
Make us all rich.

17:00.544 --> 17:02.409
Since l am already rich...

17:02.546 --> 17:05.013
maybe you could
get your chorus line
out of our way...

17:05.215 --> 17:08.083
before one of these ladies
knocks you down.

17:10.154 --> 17:12.645
You try to be nice to people
and what do you get?

17:13.590 --> 17:15.718
Teach this clown
some manners.

17:29.640 --> 17:31.130
Thanks, fellas.

17:32.009 --> 17:33.033
Now...

17:33.544 --> 17:36.377
if l was you, l'd get rid
of those three apes, you know.

17:36.480 --> 17:38.380
They're strictly
off the rack...

17:38.449 --> 17:39.882
like their boss.

17:40.017 --> 17:42.747
Here,
have a cigar.

17:42.953 --> 17:44.784
[chuckles]

18:06.443 --> 18:08.104
Please don't hurt me.

18:08.245 --> 18:11.305
l didn't wanna do that.
l hate violence.
Jimmy made me do that.

18:11.415 --> 18:12.404
Lighten up.

18:12.850 --> 18:15.080
l wanna sign
Volcano Johnson.

18:15.553 --> 18:18.750
l figure a guy like Pearl's
got to have a blindside...

18:18.956 --> 18:20.890
and you're gonna tell me
what it is.

18:21.292 --> 18:22.350
Am l right? Huh?

18:22.426 --> 18:24.758
Yeah, right.
Good.

18:24.829 --> 18:26.490
Now, tell me what it is.

18:26.664 --> 18:28.222
[mumbling]

18:28.299 --> 18:29.357
Who?

18:30.601 --> 18:32.193
lt's a bookie named McGurdy.

18:32.269 --> 18:34.897
He works out of the back
of a grocery store
over on Fifth and Main.

18:34.972 --> 18:36.963
He's holding a lot of paper
on Jimmy.

18:37.074 --> 18:39.065
You see, Jimmy
only holds onto Volcano...

18:39.143 --> 18:41.043
because it gets him chicks...

18:41.111 --> 18:43.443
and it gets his picture
in the paper once in a while.

18:43.514 --> 18:44.503
But Jimmy...

18:46.050 --> 18:47.517
he's not a good manager.

18:49.186 --> 18:50.585
lf l help you...

18:52.389 --> 18:54.721
and you do take over
Volcano's contract...

18:55.292 --> 18:58.318
can l still, like,
be the trainer?

18:58.729 --> 19:00.526
Because the big fella
and l...

19:00.598 --> 19:04.125
we go back
a long way together.

19:05.569 --> 19:06.558
Yeah, sure.

19:08.772 --> 19:10.000
You're a good boy.

19:16.580 --> 19:17.774
(Hannibal)
How'd it go?

19:17.848 --> 19:19.406
l ratted on you, Jimmy.

19:20.217 --> 19:22.447
l didn't want to do it
but l did it.

19:22.720 --> 19:25.951
And, like a pigeon
flying home to roost,
he's on his way.

19:29.860 --> 19:31.122
[gun fires]

19:34.265 --> 19:35.254
All right!

19:37.968 --> 19:38.957
[sighing]

19:40.204 --> 19:41.330
l told Whispering Willie...

19:41.405 --> 19:44.340
that l was gonna pay him back
every cent l owed him
with interest.

19:44.408 --> 19:47.343
l mean, l swear to you
on my sainted mother.
You gotta believe me!

19:47.478 --> 19:49.571
Whispering Willie.
l kind of like that.

19:50.347 --> 19:53.510
[stuttering]
You mean, Whispering Willie
didn't send you?

19:54.118 --> 19:55.847
(Hannibal)
Give that man a cigar.

19:57.187 --> 20:00.623
You just picked up
Jimmy Pearl's markers.

20:17.808 --> 20:20.436
What'd you have, a hurricane
come through here?

20:20.511 --> 20:23.071
We got raided. lt happens
a couple times a year.

20:23.347 --> 20:25.713
You boys looking
to lay down a little action?

20:27.017 --> 20:31.852
l hear you take
a lot of action from
a friend of mine, Jimmy Pearl.

20:32.056 --> 20:33.819
No kidding?
You know Jimmy Pearl?

20:33.891 --> 20:37.691
What a prince.
He always sends roses
to my mother for her birthday.

20:38.128 --> 20:39.720
(Monroe)
Yeah, Jimmy's like that.

20:39.930 --> 20:42.398
l wanna buy up
all his markers.

20:42.466 --> 20:45.026
l owe Jimmy one.
l want to return the favor.

20:48.839 --> 20:50.170
That cover it?

20:50.674 --> 20:51.663
Sure.

20:56.246 --> 20:57.804
But l don't know
if l should do this.

20:57.881 --> 20:59.212
l mean, after all--

20:59.650 --> 21:02.710
Who am l to stop
a guy from doing a favor
for a friend?

21:03.120 --> 21:04.747
Have a good day.

21:05.789 --> 21:06.778
Let's go.

21:16.600 --> 21:17.794
(Murdock)
Top drawer.

21:22.473 --> 21:24.031
Ah! Nice.

21:26.443 --> 21:29.207
Well, at least we got back
the money we invested
in our boxer.

21:29.313 --> 21:33.010
Yeah, and l'm gonna make sure
you don't invest it
in nothing crazy again!

21:44.661 --> 21:47.687
Now l own Jimmy Pearl
and his boxer.

21:52.536 --> 21:53.935
[people chattering]

22:08.018 --> 22:12.182
This is a special combination
of emollients
and liniment oils...

22:12.256 --> 22:15.851
together with the tenacious
garlic root from Tanzania.

22:15.926 --> 22:18.292
This will make
your blood sing.

22:18.829 --> 22:21.161
lt will make it
come alive.

22:23.200 --> 22:26.192
Yeah, just a little bit...

22:26.270 --> 22:28.932
and then you
knead, knead, knead...

22:29.740 --> 22:32.675
chop, chop, chop,
knead, knead, knead.

22:34.144 --> 22:36.772
Hannibal, l hope
this plan of yours works...

22:36.880 --> 22:38.939
before this fool
disconnects my back.

22:39.817 --> 22:42.809
Doesn't a rat
always come back
for the cheese?

22:44.154 --> 22:45.712
And speaking of rats....

22:50.060 --> 22:51.960
(Murdock)
You feeling better,
big guy?

22:52.262 --> 22:56.358
You feel those
little itty-bitty capillaries
starting to open up...

22:56.433 --> 22:59.231
you feel those
nerve endings
starting to tingle...

22:59.303 --> 23:01.669
because l can feel it.
l can feel it.

23:01.738 --> 23:06.004
l can feel the tension flowing
out of these sinewy slabs
of muscle...

23:06.343 --> 23:09.403
and they're turning,
they're turning very soft...

23:09.480 --> 23:13.109
they're turning into
sponge like globs of jelly!

23:13.183 --> 23:15.549
Only thing
turning into jelly
is your brain!

23:15.619 --> 23:17.484
You know,
you could be right.

23:18.122 --> 23:20.613
Why don't you two go out
and run a couple of miles?

23:20.691 --> 23:22.283
l wanna talk
to your boss here.

23:22.359 --> 23:24.327
Okay, big guy, let's slap
some leather.

23:34.438 --> 23:36.133
l gotta talk to security.

23:37.341 --> 23:39.332
They let
anybody in here.

23:39.676 --> 23:42.008
You're a million laughs,
you know that, Pearl?

23:43.380 --> 23:44.938
Laugh at that, pal.

23:47.985 --> 23:51.079
That's right,
they're your markers.
l bought them all up.

23:51.221 --> 23:53.689
Ah, McGurdy would
never sell you my markers.

23:54.057 --> 23:55.854
Yeah, he's a real friend.

23:58.862 --> 23:59.851
[sighing]

24:02.065 --> 24:03.054
Well...

24:04.701 --> 24:06.566
so what
if l don't pay up?

24:06.637 --> 24:08.195
You're gonna
wrinkle my suit?

24:08.739 --> 24:11.139
You wouldn't be worth spit
if l put out...

24:11.241 --> 24:13.709
word on the street
you didn't own up
to your markers, Pearl.

24:13.844 --> 24:15.209
You wouldn't want that,
would you?

24:15.279 --> 24:18.510
[clearing throat]
Well, ah, look...

24:18.882 --> 24:20.850
l'm a little short on money
right now.

24:21.285 --> 24:24.516
l mean, give me a month.
We'll work something out.

24:24.588 --> 24:27.113
No! l'm gonna tell you
how we're gonna work this out.

24:27.191 --> 24:31.093
Your man's gonna take
Billy Marquette's place
in the Dixie Joe fight.

24:31.195 --> 24:32.321
And guess what?

24:32.429 --> 24:34.522
He doesn't have to worry
about winning.

24:35.699 --> 24:37.599
Oh! He's gonna take a dive,
huh?

24:39.136 --> 24:41.969
Yeah but, if you're gonna
bet on Dixie...

24:42.940 --> 24:45.272
then my man's gotta
come in the big favorite.

24:45.342 --> 24:48.311
l mean you're gonna
have to give him
a great big build up.

24:48.378 --> 24:50.005
Hey, we got some time.

24:50.113 --> 24:52.081
We're gonna get him
some quick fights.

24:52.449 --> 24:55.714
By the way, your guy better be
as good as everyone thinks...

24:56.520 --> 24:59.819
or you both go swimming
in a cement barrel.

25:02.125 --> 25:05.219
Oh, by the way,
l'll be expecting you out
at my place.

25:05.796 --> 25:08.492
Your man'll work out there
till the fight.

25:08.565 --> 25:09.862
Have a good day.

25:13.503 --> 25:15.232
(Monroe)
I'm telling you,
don't worry...

25:15.472 --> 25:18.032
the guy's a regular
one-man wrecking crew.

25:18.475 --> 25:21.774
The bookies are already giving
eight-to-one odds
on Volcano Johnson.

25:22.112 --> 25:24.012
When he takes the dive
l'll make a killing.

25:24.081 --> 25:26.413
(Carrenza)
Yeah, I know, I know.
But the way the papers...

25:26.483 --> 25:28.974
are building up this guy,
are you sure he'll go down?

25:29.186 --> 25:31.484
He'll go down,
and l'll have my money.

25:31.955 --> 25:33.718
Just make sure
you have the coke.

25:33.790 --> 25:35.519
(Carrenza)
You'll get it.
Yeah.

25:38.929 --> 25:41.090
[Murdock shouting]

25:41.632 --> 25:43.293
(Murdock)
Go for the soft part.

25:44.401 --> 25:46.699
Go for it, boy.

25:46.770 --> 25:48.237
You're bigger then he is.

25:49.640 --> 25:51.232
Go for it, man, go for it.

25:51.308 --> 25:53.742
That's it, go.

25:54.444 --> 25:57.572
Go for it, go for it, boy.

25:57.748 --> 25:59.613
[B.A. grunting]

25:59.850 --> 26:01.977
Go for the soft part, boy.

26:02.753 --> 26:04.482
Oh, my Gosh!

26:04.554 --> 26:05.748
(Murdock)
l don't believe it!

26:05.956 --> 26:09.983
Just make sure when he climbs
into the ring with Dixie Joe,
he comes out second best.

26:11.495 --> 26:14.794
Two minutes and 31 seconds
of the first round.
We're humming...

26:15.132 --> 26:17.293
we're moving,
nothing can stop us now.

26:17.367 --> 26:19.232
You got dynamite
in those fists, kid.

26:19.303 --> 26:21.897
And you're sleek
as chrome steel.

26:22.005 --> 26:23.529
You stick with
old Murdock here...

26:23.607 --> 26:26.337
and l'm gonna make you
the next heavyweight champion
of the world!

26:26.443 --> 26:29.003
lf l stick with you,
l'll be as crazy as you is.

26:31.048 --> 26:32.037
[exhaling]

26:33.617 --> 26:37.417
We gotta find out
where Carrenza
and the drugs are.

26:39.456 --> 26:43.187
Well l don't think that
a little birdie is gonna
tell us, Colonel.

26:44.461 --> 26:45.985
Oh, l don't know, Murdock.

26:47.230 --> 26:48.663
lt depends upon the...

26:49.833 --> 26:51.130
plumage of the bird.

27:01.044 --> 27:03.706
Hello.
Hello.

27:04.381 --> 27:05.370
Here.

27:06.350 --> 27:07.612
Allow me.

27:09.486 --> 27:10.612
Certainly.

27:10.754 --> 27:11.778
Help yourself.

27:11.955 --> 27:14.947
l never allow
a really beautiful woman...

27:15.892 --> 27:17.951
who's wet to get too dry.

27:20.330 --> 27:22.127
l imagine...

27:22.532 --> 27:26.434
being with Sonny Monroe
is really exciting.

27:27.237 --> 27:29.228
l suppose he takes you
to all...

27:29.806 --> 27:31.433
the hottest spots
in town?

27:31.541 --> 27:32.530
[sighing]

27:32.709 --> 27:36.770
lf you call boxing arenas
and dirty gyms hotspots,
then whoopie.

27:37.147 --> 27:38.739
l guess
l am the lucky girl.

27:41.785 --> 27:42.774
[sighs]

27:43.487 --> 27:45.751
l like a man
with strong hands...

27:47.624 --> 27:50.024
and strong brandy.
Help yourself.

27:50.360 --> 27:51.554
[grunting]

27:57.501 --> 28:00.902
Hey, where's Pearl?
l don't know.

28:00.971 --> 28:03.701
You know, there was a time
when he was
the life of the party.

28:03.774 --> 28:04.763
Yeah?

28:05.242 --> 28:07.142
Now all he thinks about
is boxing.

28:07.811 --> 28:08.800
Oh!

28:08.879 --> 28:10.870
He's gotten
so paranoid lately...

28:11.348 --> 28:13.373
he's been taping
all his phone calls.

28:13.483 --> 28:16.782
l mean,
who wants to have
their conversations recorded?

28:16.920 --> 28:19.787
l don't know,
maybe he wants to write
his memoirs or something...

28:20.157 --> 28:21.215
but, hey...

28:21.458 --> 28:23.551
maybe he wants
to blackmail somebody.

28:24.594 --> 28:27.927
Do you know that
when Sonny and l first met...

28:29.132 --> 28:31.657
he changed the combination
of his safe...

28:32.803 --> 28:36.261
to my measurements?
lsn't that romantic?

28:36.940 --> 28:38.430
Yeah.

28:38.542 --> 28:41.272
What's the matter,
you get lost or something?

28:45.649 --> 28:46.673
Hi, pal.

28:46.750 --> 28:49.548
That's private property.
Just don't forget it.

28:49.619 --> 28:52.349
No, l was just
scrubbing her back,
you know....

28:54.491 --> 28:55.856
Thirty eight...

28:56.259 --> 28:57.453
twenty six...

28:58.895 --> 29:00.089
thirty eight.

29:01.097 --> 29:02.086
Nice.

29:02.866 --> 29:04.527
Are you sure about
the numbers?

29:04.935 --> 29:08.632
Hannibal, some people are
connoisseurs of wine,
some are into art.

29:08.772 --> 29:09.761
Me?

29:10.073 --> 29:11.506
Need l say more?
No.

29:50.180 --> 29:51.704
[beeping]

29:56.419 --> 29:58.387
(Monroe)
I'll leave a ticket for you
at the gate.

29:58.455 --> 30:00.423
(Carrenza)
Hey, man,
I don't like crowds.

30:00.490 --> 30:02.685
I'm gonna watch the fight
on cable TV.

30:02.893 --> 30:05.259
You just have the money
ready for the buy...

30:05.562 --> 30:08.190
and I'll be at the warehouse
just like we planned.

30:09.966 --> 30:12.833
Yeah. l got the phone number
off those beeps on the tape.

30:12.903 --> 30:15.633
Tracked down an address
on Carrenza. Get this...

30:16.106 --> 30:18.404
he leases a warehouse
in San Pedro.

30:18.542 --> 30:20.442
That's where the drug buy
is going down.

30:20.510 --> 30:22.239
We'll meet Carrenza there
after the fight...

30:22.345 --> 30:24.279
see to it that
he doesn't get lonely.
Right.

30:24.347 --> 30:26.008
Okay, l'll see you there.

30:27.551 --> 30:28.813
[birds chirping]

30:34.824 --> 30:35.848
[grunting]

30:39.729 --> 30:42.254
There, that should do it.

30:42.499 --> 30:45.593
l'm still not quite sure
how this is gonna work.

30:45.802 --> 30:47.326
Oh, well,
it's simple, really.

30:47.437 --> 30:50.600
You see, we convince Carrenza
that B.A.'s gonna
take the dive...

30:50.674 --> 30:52.505
that way he'll still show up
with the drugs.

30:52.576 --> 30:54.806
Only Monroe won't be there
to meet him with the money.

30:54.878 --> 30:56.709
See, we'll be there instead.

30:56.913 --> 30:59.473
(Face)
l knew it. Yeah.

31:00.150 --> 31:02.778
See, we had a big wind...

31:02.852 --> 31:05.616
over on Oxnard Street.
Yeah...

31:05.889 --> 31:07.049
blew the cable down.

31:07.123 --> 31:09.956
Half the block's got nothing
but snow on their TV sets.

31:10.560 --> 31:13.927
Okay, okay, but you guys
can fix the thing, can't you?

31:14.130 --> 31:16.121
l gotta watch
a fight tonight.
Oh!

31:16.199 --> 31:18.690
So you're a fight fan?
Oh, yeah, sure.

31:18.768 --> 31:20.793
Shouldn't be any problem here.
You see we...

31:21.137 --> 31:25.403
we just make a little
adjustment in the
unit regulator and...

31:25.475 --> 31:26.908
that usually does the trick.

31:27.043 --> 31:30.012
You know, at least until
the main repair crew
gets here.

31:30.080 --> 31:31.206
See, l'm just, kind of--

31:31.348 --> 31:33.213
Just get it fixed, huh?

31:33.383 --> 31:35.180
Oh, yeah. Sure.

31:50.133 --> 31:51.464
Excuse me, sir.

31:51.534 --> 31:55.664
Right now, we're running
a special introductory offer

31:55.739 --> 31:58.264

31:58.341 --> 32:00.468
Hey! My friend, how long
is it gonna take you?

32:00.543 --> 32:02.272
Well, just finished.

32:02.746 --> 32:04.270
Let's run a check on it,
shall we?

32:04.347 --> 32:06.178
Yeah, it should
work like a charm.

32:06.249 --> 32:07.841
And there's no extra charge.

32:09.653 --> 32:11.382
[television playing]

32:11.488 --> 32:14.480
Bingo! Perfect reception.
What did l tell you?

32:15.058 --> 32:19.154
Yeah, although l'd just adjust
that color control.

32:19.462 --> 32:21.760
The flesh tones
look a little...

32:22.165 --> 32:23.291
off.

32:26.002 --> 32:27.094
[bell rings]

32:27.804 --> 32:30.329
Ladies and gentlemen...

32:30.407 --> 32:33.103
this is the feature bout
of the evening.

32:33.243 --> 32:35.973
A 12 round main event...

32:36.046 --> 32:39.504
presenting the big boys
of boxing...

32:39.582 --> 32:41.550
heavyweights.

32:41.751 --> 32:43.013
[bell rings]

32:43.286 --> 32:45.379
Introducing to you
on my left...

32:45.455 --> 32:47.923
wearing green trunks
and weighing in...

32:47.991 --> 32:51.017
at 227 and a quarter pounds...

32:51.161 --> 32:55.029
with a fine record of
sixteen-three and one.

32:55.098 --> 32:58.499
Fourteen knockouts
in his 16 wins.

32:58.601 --> 33:03.300
The fighting Irishman from
Seattle, Washington...

33:03.440 --> 33:06.500
Dixie Joe Mulligan!

33:06.643 --> 33:08.474
[crowd cheering]

33:13.016 --> 33:14.005
[bell rings]

33:15.051 --> 33:18.077
And his opponent on my right,
in the opposite corner...

33:18.154 --> 33:22.784
a substitute for the injured
Billy Marquette.

33:23.059 --> 33:24.924
He wears red trunks...

33:24.994 --> 33:28.794
weighing in
at 231 and a half pounds...

33:29.032 --> 33:32.229
hailing from
parts unknown...

33:32.302 --> 33:35.430
the mysterious and awesome...

33:35.505 --> 33:39.168
Volcano Johnson!

33:39.375 --> 33:40.933
[crowd cheering]

33:44.948 --> 33:47.382
(announcer)
Instructions.: low and lethal.

33:48.651 --> 33:51.950
Now, l don't think
you'll work up
any sweat with this guy.

33:53.123 --> 33:55.614
But Monroe thinks
you're going for a dive.

33:56.059 --> 33:59.028
So let's surprise him.
Yeah, really surprise him.

33:59.095 --> 34:01.359
Here's what
l want you to do.
First couple of a rounds...

34:01.431 --> 34:03.922
l want you to soften him up
with your jab.
Then work him hard...

34:04.000 --> 34:06.833
against the ropes.
A little reverse-rope-a-dope,
you know what l mean?

34:06.903 --> 34:09.963
But keep him off his bicycle.
We're gonna use
ring psychology on this guy.

34:10.039 --> 34:11.699
Shut up, fool!
l know what l'm doing!

34:12.708 --> 34:14.233
l don't trust this guy.

34:14.610 --> 34:16.545
Everything taken care of?
Yeah.

34:16.913 --> 34:18.938
l spiked
his mouth-piece water.

34:19.581 --> 34:21.277
That stuff will slow down
an elephant.

34:21.351 --> 34:22.511
[buzzing]

34:22.585 --> 34:25.349
By the end of the second
round, he should be
walking in his sleep.

34:31.561 --> 34:32.687
[bell rings]

34:43.572 --> 34:45.541
There you go,
everything's all hooked up.

34:45.775 --> 34:46.935
(Tina)
Face, you're amazing.

34:47.243 --> 34:48.972
When this is over,
l'm going to buy you...

34:49.045 --> 34:50.603
the best dinner
you've ever had.

34:52.514 --> 34:54.915
There, cute, isn't he?

34:56.052 --> 34:57.713

35:05.895 --> 35:07.192
[crowd clamoring]

35:24.647 --> 35:27.980
That jab, hold that jab.
Hold that glove up there!

35:41.965 --> 35:43.660
l...

35:45.668 --> 35:49.866
l don't believe it!
This guy's cleaning up
on Dixie Joe!

35:50.773 --> 35:52.070
[people cheering]

35:56.713 --> 35:58.271
(Murdock)
Play with him, boy!

35:58.514 --> 35:59.913
Play with him!

36:02.218 --> 36:03.207
[bell rings]

36:07.090 --> 36:08.216
[man whistling]

36:10.894 --> 36:11.883
[panting]

36:13.329 --> 36:14.591
You look good, B.A.

36:15.031 --> 36:16.760
The guy's a sucker
for a right hook.

36:16.833 --> 36:19.768
Yeah. l'm gonna cut
the ring off on him.
Make him work for it.

36:19.836 --> 36:21.030
You're looking great.

36:21.104 --> 36:22.230
[bell buzzing]

36:22.305 --> 36:26.036
You're looking real sharp.
As a matter of fact you're
so good. What do you say?

36:26.109 --> 36:29.374
After this fight, you and me
on the dotted line,
a contract, huh?

36:29.579 --> 36:30.568
[bell rings]

36:32.081 --> 36:33.412
[crowd cheering]

36:34.817 --> 36:35.806
[yelling]

36:40.490 --> 36:42.958
l think our friend
down the street
has seen enough, don't you?

36:43.026 --> 36:44.459
Mmm-hmm.

36:56.005 --> 36:58.405
(Carrenza)
Damn! What happened
to the picture?

37:00.977 --> 37:03.673
And they told me
they got this thing
fixed this morning!

37:05.148 --> 37:08.640
(announcer)
...and Dixie Joe
staggers Volcano Johnson...

37:08.718 --> 37:10.481
with a hard right
to the stomach!

37:10.553 --> 37:15.388
Johnson tries to cover up
but Dixie Joe moves in
with a flurry of combinations.

37:15.458 --> 37:16.686
This is an incredible fight.

37:16.759 --> 37:18.818
It's unbelievable
It has turned
completely around.

37:18.895 --> 37:21.659
Dixie Joe's
ripping combinations
into the body of Johnson...

37:21.731 --> 37:24.325
and Johnson is in trouble.
It's all Dixie Joe now.

37:24.400 --> 37:26.493
Johnson is covering.
He's against the ropes.

37:27.203 --> 37:28.192
[people cheering]

37:28.338 --> 37:29.965
(Murdock)
Open up!

37:31.874 --> 37:33.535
Now's the time!

37:42.085 --> 37:43.074
[bell rings]

37:44.721 --> 37:45.847
[crowd cheering]

37:50.293 --> 37:52.784
You all right? He gave you
a couple of hard shots
in there.

37:52.862 --> 37:54.159
[panting]

37:54.864 --> 37:57.355
lt's alright. l'm okay.
He just got lucky.

37:57.433 --> 37:59.594
Here you go.
That's it. Here, take
some of this water.

37:59.669 --> 38:02.433
Now take
a deep breath. Relax.

38:02.505 --> 38:03.494
[bell buzzing]

38:03.573 --> 38:06.064
Now, stoke up
that old turbo charger...

38:06.142 --> 38:08.201
and l want you to know
that when you go back
out there...

38:08.277 --> 38:10.177
you ain't going
out there alone.

38:10.246 --> 38:13.807
l'm gonna be out there
perched on your shoulder
in spirit, rooting you on!

38:16.219 --> 38:17.447
[crowd cheering]

38:36.739 --> 38:40.197
Dixie Joe's killing him.
He'll go down
any minute now. Yeah.

38:43.046 --> 38:44.980
(announcer)
Dixie Joe moves in now
he moves....

38:45.048 --> 38:47.573
Oh, he scores with a
looping lift.

38:47.650 --> 38:50.676
He continues to move in
and he connects
with an uppercut this time....

38:58.327 --> 38:59.316
[bell rings]
Stop!

39:01.397 --> 39:02.523
[people cheering]

39:03.132 --> 39:04.326
[people applauding]

39:07.637 --> 39:10.231
B.A.,
you're moving real slow.

39:10.339 --> 39:11.499
You all right?

39:11.607 --> 39:13.097
l'm just trying
to catch my breath.

39:14.010 --> 39:15.238
[people hooting]

39:15.912 --> 39:17.072
[bell buzzing]

39:20.450 --> 39:21.439
[bell rings]

39:25.555 --> 39:28.388
(announcer)
...tries and tries to cover
but Dixie Joe moves in...

39:28.458 --> 39:30.050
with a flurry
of combinations....

39:30.126 --> 39:31.252
Gee, l don't know.

39:31.327 --> 39:33.591
lt looks like B.A.'s
going for the dive.

39:33.663 --> 39:34.925
[phone ringing]

39:35.998 --> 39:38.626
(Hannibal)
Things are starting
to unravel.

39:38.734 --> 39:41.464
Starting to unravel?
That's putting it mildly.

39:41.771 --> 39:45.104
What's the matter with B.A. ?
This guy's using him
for a punching bag.

39:45.308 --> 39:48.573
So, now,
you think that's bad?
Let me tell you something.

39:49.011 --> 39:51.479
Nobody's listening
to your broadcast.

39:51.547 --> 39:54.539
What?
Monroe just got
some company.

39:54.617 --> 39:56.414
The dark haired guy...

39:56.486 --> 39:58.818
skinny, in a white suit
carrying a bag...

39:58.888 --> 40:01.823
which, l don't think
he's got boxing gloves in it.

40:01.891 --> 40:03.222
Carrenza?

40:03.426 --> 40:05.894
That means he's gonna
make the deal on the arena.

40:05.962 --> 40:08.692
You better hurry down here
or you're gonna miss
all the fun.

40:08.764 --> 40:10.231
Yeah, right.
l'm on my way.

40:11.968 --> 40:13.333
[people cheering]

40:14.403 --> 40:15.927
He's been drugged somehow.

40:16.005 --> 40:17.029
l don't know
what it is.

40:17.106 --> 40:18.300
Come on B.A.
Shake it off.

40:18.374 --> 40:19.568
l think it's all over.

40:20.476 --> 40:22.603
Look, you gotta go
into that ring...

40:22.678 --> 40:24.305
and you gotta
kick some butt...

40:24.380 --> 40:27.406
because somewhere out there,
there's a little kid.

40:27.483 --> 40:32.045
A little kid who's got
a picture of Volcano Johnson
taped above his pillow.

40:32.121 --> 40:34.316
And that little kid
has gone to bed tonight...

40:34.390 --> 40:37.154
believing that his hero
is gonna win.

40:37.226 --> 40:39.592
Now what's gonna happen
when that little kid
wakes up...

40:39.662 --> 40:42.893
and finds out
that his hero has lost.

40:42.965 --> 40:46.093
That somebody
has taken the fire
out of Volcano Johnson?

40:46.169 --> 40:49.070
Just imagine
that little kid's eyes...

40:49.272 --> 40:51.240
glistening
with little tiny tears.

40:51.307 --> 40:53.241
(Hannibal)
No. lt's not gonna
work, Murdock.

40:53.309 --> 40:54.674
This calls
for something drastic.

40:54.744 --> 40:56.803
What about that aromatic stuff
you made?

40:56.879 --> 40:58.847
Yeah,
l got them right here.

40:59.682 --> 41:02.276
This stuff will take
the shine off chrome, Colonel.

41:05.888 --> 41:08.220
No, we need
something drastic here.

41:10.226 --> 41:11.523
[bell buzzing]

41:11.594 --> 41:13.687
Come on B.A.,
you can do it.

41:13.763 --> 41:14.855
You yourself told me...

41:14.931 --> 41:17.525
you don't know the meaning
of those two little words...

41:17.600 --> 41:19.659
''give up''.
l'm counting on you...

41:19.735 --> 41:21.293
the world's
counting on you...

41:21.370 --> 41:23.361
Howard Cossell's
counting on you!

41:23.906 --> 41:25.464
(Hannibal)
He's got his eyes open.

41:29.478 --> 41:30.843
[bell rings]

41:48.664 --> 41:49.995
[people cheering]

42:11.087 --> 42:13.214
You told me you got
this thing fixed!

42:13.990 --> 42:16.458
l told you it's been
taken care of.

42:20.329 --> 42:21.887
[people cheering]

42:23.399 --> 42:27.165
(referee)
...four, five, six...

42:28.104 --> 42:31.767
(all)
seven, eight, nine...

42:32.441 --> 42:34.341
ten! You're out!

42:34.677 --> 42:36.235
[people cheering]

42:39.415 --> 42:40.677
[people applauding]

42:46.589 --> 42:47.578
[bell rings]

42:49.125 --> 42:50.820
Your attention, friends.

42:51.027 --> 42:52.688
We have the time...

42:52.762 --> 42:57.529
in two minutes
and five seconds
in round number five...

42:57.600 --> 43:00.763
the winner by knockout...

43:00.836 --> 43:04.067
Volcano Johnson!

43:04.206 --> 43:05.537
[people cheering]

43:06.609 --> 43:08.338
l want Pearl!

43:08.644 --> 43:09.975
[people cheering]

43:20.156 --> 43:22.249
Mr. Monroe wants
to see you, pal.

43:22.325 --> 43:24.020
Yeah,
l thought he might.

43:24.093 --> 43:26.084
l'll see you
in the locker room.

43:28.831 --> 43:30.799
Well,
Mr. Monroe...

43:30.866 --> 43:32.731
enjoy the fight, huh?

43:32.802 --> 43:35.362
You just bought yourself
six feet of desert, wise guy.

43:35.471 --> 43:37.598
Along with those
two other clowns.

43:43.913 --> 43:45.540
A little ice
will work wonders.

43:45.881 --> 43:47.109
Where's Hannibal?

43:47.183 --> 43:48.172
He's on his way down.

43:48.250 --> 43:50.275
And l think he's bringing
some of his friends.

43:50.419 --> 43:52.182
Oh, great!

43:52.254 --> 43:55.485
What l don't put up with.
Here, would you hold this?

43:56.225 --> 43:57.817
There you go. Out.

44:01.864 --> 44:02.990
Bury them!

44:38.434 --> 44:42.029
Now, these little beauties
should get you sleaze balls...

44:42.104 --> 44:45.301
about 20 years each.

44:48.878 --> 44:50.505
We owe you
for everything.

44:50.579 --> 44:53.377
Our lives,
Billy's career,
everything.

44:53.449 --> 44:54.916
(Billy)
That's right. l mean...

44:55.050 --> 44:58.747
sometimes it takes a hard head
like me a little while
to realize it, but...

45:00.556 --> 45:02.786
a guy couldn't ask
for a better bunch
of managers.

45:03.392 --> 45:06.486
Allow me to present you
with 60% of your future...

45:06.562 --> 45:08.757
that we signed over to you
and your sister.

45:08.864 --> 45:10.593
Now we made
a good profit...

45:10.833 --> 45:12.528
on selling Monroe
our markers.

45:13.002 --> 45:16.028
Monroe, incidentally,
is currently sharing
a cell with Carrenza.

45:16.238 --> 45:17.705
That's great!
Gee, thanks.

45:17.773 --> 45:19.001
No more, now go on.

45:19.074 --> 45:21.099
Thanks.
Hey, do you
believe that? Thanks.

45:21.177 --> 45:22.644
l've never seen
anything like it.

45:22.711 --> 45:24.542
l'm telling you,
it was a great experience.

45:24.613 --> 45:27.776
You were terrific champ!
He never knew what hit him.

45:27.850 --> 45:29.750
Don't you just love
happy endings?

45:30.252 --> 45:33.278
And all because
someone had
the financial foresight...

45:33.355 --> 45:37.451
to be bold, when others
had no faith.

45:37.693 --> 45:39.160
(Murdock)
l knew you'd like it, Faceman.

45:39.228 --> 45:43.221
That's why the A-Team
has signed you
to fight next Tuesday night.

45:43.532 --> 45:44.464
Me?
Uh-huh.

45:44.533 --> 45:46.467
Fight?
That's right, Face.

45:46.535 --> 45:47.627
Middleweight.

45:47.703 --> 45:48.795
You're fighting...

45:48.938 --> 45:50.462
Butcher Murphy.

45:50.573 --> 45:52.905
(Murdock)
lt's just like you said,
we're gonna make a fortune!

45:52.975 --> 45:57.537
And we have billed you
as ''Dandy Dan'' Peckman,
the ladies delight!

45:57.613 --> 45:58.773
Oh no, fellas,
l can't.

45:58.848 --> 46:00.975
Oh, Tuesday. l gotta get
a haircut on Tuesday.

46:01.050 --> 46:02.449
l got a date
with a lady analyst...

46:02.518 --> 46:05.646
and we're having cocktails
with the head of MGM at 5:00.

46:05.721 --> 46:07.450
So--
Faceman...

46:08.224 --> 46:10.522
you're gonna
be there or else.

46:10.826 --> 46:11.884
[stuttering]
Yeah, well....

46:11.961 --> 46:13.553
[Hannibal laughing]

46:13.829 --> 46:16.127
l love it
when a plan comes together.
