A SERIES BASED ON THE BOOK "ANNA"
WRITTEN BY NICCOLÒ AMMANITI IN 2015

00:19.800 --> 00:22.760
THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
HIT 6 MONTHS AFTER FILMING BEGAN

00:28.920 --> 00:31.960
THE INVISIBLE BOAR

03:23.920 --> 03:25.680
- Would you like some water?
- Yes.

03:28.880 --> 03:30.080
Thanks.

03:36.360 --> 03:37.440
Who are you?

03:39.240 --> 03:40.320
Where are the Blue Kids?

03:42.120 --> 03:44.120
Down in the cellars.

03:46.040 --> 03:47.200
Thanks.

05:05.920 --> 05:07.320
Astor?

05:14.880 --> 05:16.200
Anna.

05:34.280 --> 05:35.880
Where's the new girl?

05:45.120 --> 05:46.720
Don't start, come on.

05:48.880 --> 05:52.040
- Why not?
- You lied to me.

05:55.400 --> 05:58.200
You're not magic, there are no monsters.

05:59.040 --> 06:01.920
- I have friends here.
- What friends? They're slaves.

06:02.640 --> 06:03.640
Shut up!

06:04.120 --> 06:06.400
I'm your sister, I'm in charge.

06:08.920 --> 06:11.040
- Mama's waiting for us.
- She's dead!

06:11.240 --> 06:13.520
- Shut up.
- You're mean!

06:14.600 --> 06:16.840
There she is! Let's get her!

06:21.040 --> 06:22.440
Let go of me!

07:38.480 --> 07:40.320
Keep still!

07:49.160 --> 07:50.640
You disappointed me.

07:51.600 --> 07:54.360
I'm leaving
and my brother's coming with me.

07:57.280 --> 08:00.000
Precious, do you want to go
with your sister?

08:08.600 --> 08:10.800
He's my brother and I decide!

08:16.080 --> 08:20.840
You're all sick, you cover yourselves
in white to hide the Red Fever!

08:21.040 --> 08:23.200
You're all going to die!

08:25.720 --> 08:26.840
Get her on the ground.

08:31.800 --> 08:34.000
Keep still, stupid!

08:39.480 --> 08:40.800
Let go of me.

08:48.800 --> 08:50.560
Let go of me, you bitch!

09:02.560 --> 09:04.640
Thirteen, maybe fourteen.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.040
You haven't got long either.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.800
But everyone here is going to live,

09:11.920 --> 09:15.480
because on the Night of Fire we'll burn
the Little Lady and eat her ashes.

09:16.040 --> 09:17.800
Now you're going to burn her?

09:18.960 --> 09:21.000
Kissing her wasn't enough?

09:21.200 --> 09:23.400
The Little Lady doesn't exist!

09:23.600 --> 09:25.640
The Grown-ups are all dead.

09:25.840 --> 09:29.160
- Who's under that helmet?
- You'll soon find out.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.840
You'll burn alive with her, like a witch.

09:34.640 --> 09:35.440
Let her go.

09:49.680 --> 09:51.920
I'll give you an immunity challenge.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.200
Have you ever played tag?

09:55.560 --> 09:57.680
Tag! Tag!

10:00.720 --> 10:02.600
Good, it works like this:

10:02.800 --> 10:05.040
they'll chase you and you run.

10:05.760 --> 10:08.880
In the Grown-up world
if you got caught, you paid a penalty,

10:09.400 --> 10:12.320
but here in the Red Fever world,

10:13.080 --> 10:14.360
you die.

10:16.320 --> 10:18.400
You're so pretty.

10:20.680 --> 10:24.600
I want to be good to you,
I'll give you a thirty second start.

10:24.800 --> 10:25.880
Run!

10:26.080 --> 10:27.680
Run, Anna.

10:27.760 --> 10:28.760
Yeah, run.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.640
You'd better run!

10:34.040 --> 10:37.040
One, two, three, four, five...

10:39.240 --> 10:41.040
Thirty! Get her!

10:41.800 --> 10:43.240
Catch her!

10:45.440 --> 10:48.640
What are you doing here?
Go on, have fun.

12:15.040 --> 12:16.440
She's not here.

12:17.320 --> 12:18.960
Look behind there.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.640
I caught her first.

13:55.920 --> 13:57.000
Hi, Anna.

14:11.680 --> 14:13.040
Katia!

14:13.520 --> 14:15.120
I'm home.

14:22.120 --> 14:23.120
May I?

14:24.840 --> 14:28.320
I met Mr Marino's daughter,
she sent you this.

14:30.200 --> 14:34.080
She wants you to take in the waist
and shorten the hem.

14:38.240 --> 14:40.680
It's an Yves Saint Laurent original.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.720
- You sure she wants to alter it?
- That's what she said.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.000
- Do it.
- But I'll need to fit it on her.

14:46.160 --> 14:48.560
As if, she doesn't have time.

14:50.960 --> 14:54.240
- You put a lot of saffron in it.
- It's a new recipe.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.920
- Pasta with clams?
- Why?

14:57.240 --> 14:59.200
<i>Over 300 deaths from the RV36 virus.</i>

14:59.400 --> 15:01.600
<i>To date there is no known treatment.</i>

15:01.800 --> 15:05.640
<i>Preventative quarantine is urged
for those with symptoms...</i>

15:05.840 --> 15:07.640
Yes? Who is it?

15:10.560 --> 15:13.640
It's Mr Marino's daughter,
she wants to thank you.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.520
What a pain.

15:16.080 --> 15:17.880
Good morning, sorry,

15:18.080 --> 15:20.560
it's lunchtime, I'm so rude,

15:20.760 --> 15:23.800
but I wanted to thank your daughter
for altering my dress.

15:26.400 --> 15:27.600
Here.

15:33.800 --> 15:34.960
Hello.

15:36.160 --> 15:38.320
- Ginevra, pleasure.
- Katia.

15:38.600 --> 15:41.520
I wanted to thank you
for the amazing job you did.

15:42.160 --> 15:43.640
It's just a hem.

15:44.120 --> 15:48.560
I brought you a dress of my mother's
from the '70s, vintage.

15:49.280 --> 15:52.640
- Look, what gorgeous fabric!
- Beautiful.

15:53.080 --> 15:54.480
Will you take it in?

15:54.880 --> 15:57.400
Sure, but I need to measure you.

16:07.720 --> 16:10.600
- There was no need.
- For what?

16:14.040 --> 16:16.440
- Did you do these?
- Yes.

16:16.640 --> 16:18.240
They're beautiful.

16:18.440 --> 16:19.840
Look!

16:20.800 --> 16:23.720
- I want one now.
- You can take it.

16:25.360 --> 16:27.760
No, darling, I meant made up.

16:32.120 --> 16:34.920
You're insanely talented.

16:35.960 --> 16:38.400
I know everyone in the fashion world,

16:38.760 --> 16:41.480
Daniele the owner of Chino
is my best friend.

16:42.920 --> 16:45.560
You should do an internship with him.

16:47.720 --> 16:49.720
You know? A fashion internship.

16:51.600 --> 16:53.720
- Where?
- In Milan.

16:55.320 --> 16:56.720
I can't go anywhere.

16:57.920 --> 16:59.200
Yeah, all right.

16:59.720 --> 17:02.880
I'll call Daniele anyway, okay?

17:03.400 --> 17:07.000
Don't worry, I'm going
to make over your life.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.280
The dress will be ready in two days.

17:33.640 --> 17:35.640
Cinderella, she's awake.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.800
- Group hug.
- Yay, she's awake!

17:49.120 --> 17:50.840
Hi, what's your name?

17:51.400 --> 17:55.240
- Why did you tie me up?
- What's your name?

17:56.240 --> 17:57.480
Anna.

17:58.400 --> 17:59.640
Untie me, please.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.920
What a lovely name you have!

18:04.440 --> 18:07.120
Anna's the same forwards
and backwards.

18:07.680 --> 18:10.240
- What does that mean?
- I'll show you.

18:10.440 --> 18:11.760
It's a magical name.

18:20.960 --> 18:22.520
Does it hurt a lot?

18:24.640 --> 18:26.280
It's the snake.

18:27.760 --> 18:28.680
Untie me, please.

18:32.880 --> 18:35.200
No, come and feel her.

18:35.800 --> 18:37.160
She's burning up.

18:39.360 --> 18:41.320
Have you got any medicine?

18:42.360 --> 18:44.040
Something for a fever?

18:44.440 --> 18:46.800
- Help me!
- We'll treat you.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.360
Go and get the medicine.

18:50.840 --> 18:52.760
- Thank you.
- Don't worry.

19:03.560 --> 19:04.400
Does it hurt?

19:18.200 --> 19:19.720
What are you doing?

19:30.920 --> 19:33.280
Take the medicine, don't be naughty.

19:33.520 --> 19:34.920
Take the medicine.

19:56.960 --> 19:58.800
- Who's going to cut it?
- Me!

19:59.000 --> 20:01.600
Who's going to cut it? Let's decide.

20:02.120 --> 20:04.080
Put your hands out, though.

20:04.840 --> 20:07.200
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe,

20:07.400 --> 20:10.200
catch a tiger by the toe.

20:10.640 --> 20:13.120
If he hollers, let him go,

20:13.320 --> 20:15.360
eeny, meeny, miny, moe...

20:19.360 --> 20:20.400
Bitches!

20:22.040 --> 20:23.640
What are you going to do to me?

20:23.960 --> 20:25.200
I'll cut it.

20:28.960 --> 20:31.240
- You three, out!
- No, please.

20:32.720 --> 20:33.560
Out!

20:38.360 --> 20:40.680
- Ready, kiddo?
- No!

20:57.360 --> 20:59.760
Well? Are you sure?

21:00.920 --> 21:02.680
Yes, you go.

21:03.560 --> 21:06.480
But there's only Giovanni
and the Monzis.

21:06.680 --> 21:08.400
I don't want to go out tonight.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.320
Whereas the other times...
I don't believe it!

21:11.840 --> 21:14.520
- How long since she left the house?
- Drop it.

21:14.720 --> 21:17.680
What's wrong with you?
People say you're crazy.

21:17.880 --> 21:20.920
Never mind what people say, Dad.

21:21.120 --> 21:24.120
- What's she talking about?
- Nothing.

21:24.320 --> 21:25.920
Really, chill out.

21:26.800 --> 21:30.720
You go, say hi to Francesco and Laura.

21:32.680 --> 21:34.040
Bye, darling.

21:51.400 --> 21:52.760
Katia!

22:00.400 --> 22:02.320
Come down for a minute.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.400
Look, I'm getting married!

22:11.200 --> 22:14.240
Oh, my god! I'm madly in love!

22:15.640 --> 22:17.720
And you're going to make my dress.

22:18.400 --> 22:19.800
- You hear me?
- Yes.

22:27.560 --> 22:29.960
Why didn't you go to Milan?

22:30.480 --> 22:31.680
Daniele was expecting you.

22:33.760 --> 22:35.880
The city's not for me.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.120
Anyway, you did the right thing,

22:45.600 --> 22:48.280
because Milan, my dear,
is coming to you.

22:49.760 --> 22:53.080
Forget about Chino,
everyone's coming to my wedding:

22:53.440 --> 22:56.000
models, designers, celebrities.

22:56.320 --> 22:59.320
Everyone's expecting
a designer dress from me, but no,

23:00.240 --> 23:02.360
I'll turn up in your dress.

23:06.320 --> 23:08.400
Don't touch that, it's my mother's.

23:10.760 --> 23:12.560
Don't touch it, you bitch!

23:14.560 --> 23:19.000
Useful, pity there's nothing about
how to cut off an arm.

23:22.680 --> 23:24.520
Let's operate.

23:26.360 --> 23:28.840
Don't cut off my arm, please!

23:30.320 --> 23:31.520
Why?

23:33.400 --> 23:35.560
The viper's venom is deadly.

23:36.200 --> 23:38.480
- We have to cut off your arm.
- Why?

23:45.520 --> 23:47.600
Please! I beg you!

23:52.320 --> 23:54.640
- Please, don't!
- Be quiet.

23:58.360 --> 23:59.720
Give her the anaesthetic.

24:15.200 --> 24:17.240
Angelica, the arm can be saved.

24:19.200 --> 24:22.600
No, in all those cowboy movies
they cut the arm off.

24:25.120 --> 24:26.520
Please.

24:56.800 --> 24:58.120
Just kidding.

25:18.800 --> 25:20.640
For now it's just cloth.

26:09.200 --> 26:10.520
Are you a lesbian?

26:12.840 --> 26:14.880
There's nothing wrong with it.

26:15.080 --> 26:18.440
Actually, I can't stand men.

26:19.160 --> 26:22.760
I tried twice with women,
but it's not for me.

26:25.240 --> 26:28.040
I don't know what I am.

26:30.280 --> 26:31.680
Have you ever had a boyfriend?

26:33.440 --> 26:34.880
You've never fucked?

26:36.000 --> 26:37.840
Who would make love
with someone like me?

26:38.960 --> 26:40.760
Why, what are you like?

26:43.000 --> 26:44.280
I'm different.

26:49.600 --> 26:53.520
This cough's such a pain,
the air con on the plane wiped me out.

26:55.840 --> 26:59.240
When I get over this flu
I'll take you to Paris.

27:36.960 --> 27:40.640
- Bitches, you cut my arm off!
- It wasn't the good arm.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.880
The Little Lady said
you have to take these.

27:46.080 --> 27:48.840
You're psychos,
give me back my brother!

27:50.040 --> 27:52.240
- Give me back my arm!
- You need to drink.

27:55.960 --> 27:59.600
You dummy,
you broke the fancy clock!

28:00.720 --> 28:02.120
Drink!

28:07.840 --> 28:08.880
She spat at me.

28:10.280 --> 28:11.640
She spat at me.

28:14.480 --> 28:15.760
She spat at me.

28:21.440 --> 28:23.600
How dare you!

28:46.920 --> 28:48.160
For goodness' sake!

29:15.480 --> 29:16.960
Me!

29:35.240 --> 29:37.080
Why won't you eat?

29:37.600 --> 29:41.600
It's good, there's chocolate on the back
and cream in front.

29:44.840 --> 29:46.280
It's yummy.

29:46.400 --> 29:48.400
- Are you stupid?
- Leave me alone.

30:57.880 --> 30:59.560
Want to play with us?

31:02.760 --> 31:05.320
If you play with us,
look what I'll give you.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.920
Open up, open up!

31:44.400 --> 31:45.920
I'm not well!

31:55.200 --> 31:56.640
Open up!

32:35.920 --> 32:39.560
My poor husband,
he left us without a whimper.

32:39.640 --> 32:40.960
Come on Mom, don’t do this.

33:45.480 --> 33:48.240
<i>Stay in line and keep your distance.</i>

33:48.440 --> 33:52.080
<i>Bring valid ID with you.</i>

34:31.360 --> 34:32.600
Can you hear me?

34:34.280 --> 34:36.200
Answer me, please.

34:44.400 --> 34:45.720
I have to medicate it.

34:48.280 --> 34:49.680
Or you'll get gangrene.

35:04.400 --> 35:06.040
Can you move it?

35:17.520 --> 35:19.760
- Yes.
- Good.

35:43.440 --> 35:45.280
Mom, would you like some water?

35:50.000 --> 35:52.080
I give you another pillow.

36:14.480 --> 36:18.080
My treasure, you're blessed.

36:22.160 --> 36:24.640
The virus doesn't affect you.

36:34.160 --> 36:35.640
Mom...

36:40.000 --> 36:40.800
Come here.

36:56.760 --> 36:58.120
Go on, dig.

36:59.320 --> 37:01.560
It needs to be deeper.

37:03.280 --> 37:05.040
Come on, move it.

37:05.240 --> 37:08.160
- Can't you guys do it?
- We've done half a hole.

37:10.960 --> 37:12.720
Come on, lively!

37:29.320 --> 37:30.560
Pray.

37:32.360 --> 37:35.560
Lovely Anna's arm rests in peace here.

37:36.360 --> 37:37.720
Amen.

37:39.040 --> 37:40.480
Fill it in.

37:51.040 --> 37:53.520
Darling, I'm sorry heaps.

37:56.920 --> 37:59.800
Take her inside,
she has to try on the dress.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.920
- Take an arm off all the dolls.
- Yes!

38:51.160 --> 38:52.640
Show her the dress.

39:10.960 --> 39:14.800
Do you like it?
It was my sister Ginevra's.

39:23.800 --> 39:28.040
You'll wear it on the Night of Fire
and you and I will be married.

39:36.640 --> 39:38.320
Cut off a sleeve and fix it up.

40:21.400 --> 40:22.880
Come, darling.

40:30.320 --> 40:33.800
<i>- I got the ball!
- Good catch!</i>

40:36.240 --> 40:38.960
- Look at the star.
- Where is it?

41:38.160 --> 41:39.480
It really suits you.

41:47.640 --> 41:49.120
Katia.

41:50.560 --> 41:52.400
You've got to escape,

41:52.480 --> 41:55.840
Angelica said she'll burn you
on the Night of Fire.

42:01.520 --> 42:03.600
Together we can make it.

42:04.760 --> 42:07.360
Quiet, they can hear you.

42:32.160 --> 42:33.480
What are you doing?

42:33.920 --> 42:37.360
- Don't give her the yellow ones.
- Play on your own.

42:37.560 --> 42:40.560
- Don't give her the yellow ones.
- Stop it!

42:40.760 --> 42:43.880
- The yellow ones are for headaches.
- But she doesn't have a headache.

42:44.080 --> 42:46.920
Besides, the yellow ones are gross,
give her the green ones.

42:48.120 --> 42:49.720
I've had it with you.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.200
Stop it!

42:52.040 --> 42:53.040
Leave me alone!

42:54.400 --> 42:56.960
Ouch, my head.

42:59.320 --> 43:01.680
You hurt me.
Now I'm gonna pull your hair.

43:09.040 --> 43:10.040
Look!

43:11.200 --> 43:12.840
Look at him!

43:18.040 --> 43:19.600
Where are you going?

43:21.600 --> 43:22.920
Stop!

43:23.520 --> 43:24.720
Open up!

43:37.400 --> 43:38.760
Open up!

44:08.200 --> 44:10.840
What happened to your arm?

44:12.440 --> 44:13.800
It was the viper.

44:17.680 --> 44:19.600
Don't cry, I'm fine.

44:21.040 --> 44:24.720
- But you can't live without an arm.
- Sure, I can.

44:28.840 --> 44:31.680
Astor, you have to leave.

44:31.880 --> 44:34.240
If they catch you, they'll kill you.

44:36.280 --> 44:37.760
I want to stay with you.

44:37.960 --> 44:40.320
You have to take the road home,

44:40.640 --> 44:43.520
there nearby is a beautiful lake
called the Reeds.

44:43.720 --> 44:46.880
There's a tall blond boy,
his name's Pietro.

44:47.200 --> 44:49.040
He'll help us.

44:49.680 --> 44:51.520
No, I can't get there by myself.

44:55.960 --> 44:57.280
Help me.

44:58.960 --> 45:00.240
Come.

45:08.680 --> 45:09.920
Go!

45:12.120 --> 45:15.680
- No, I'm afraid.
- Of what? You're so strong.

45:16.360 --> 45:18.800
You're a strong boar,

45:19.000 --> 45:20.880
you're an invisible boar.

45:21.280 --> 45:22.080
Invisible.

45:24.560 --> 45:27.640
Take the cloak, the blanket.

45:28.480 --> 45:30.880
Go, quick! Go, Astor!

45:53.520 --> 45:56.680
- Back up.
- Harder this time. Ready?

47:03.920 --> 47:05.320
Ginevra?

48:20.560 --> 48:22.320
What are you doing?

48:22.800 --> 48:24.400
Don't touch her!

48:57.080 --> 48:58.560
You're hurting me.

49:08.080 --> 49:11.000
At the Fire Celebration
I'll look beautiful.

49:18.120 --> 49:20.160
Is it true you want to burn me?

49:22.120 --> 49:24.200
No, who told you that?

49:29.680 --> 49:31.400
I know you,

49:32.080 --> 49:34.880
I know when you're lying,
don't lie to me.

49:36.960 --> 49:38.240
Dry me.

49:56.960 --> 49:58.960
It's a horrible death.

50:00.320 --> 50:01.600
Why?

50:05.000 --> 50:06.560
Why do you want to do it?

50:10.520 --> 50:12.880
You know what I want to do?

50:15.480 --> 50:17.640
I'll throw a huge party

50:18.040 --> 50:20.680
and everyone will eat your ashes.

50:21.400 --> 50:23.920
But they'll die just the same,
you know that?

50:25.800 --> 50:28.040
Yes, everyone will die:

50:29.000 --> 50:31.840
me, you, them.

50:32.400 --> 50:35.840
It's all your fault,
you should've saved me and you didn't!

50:36.720 --> 50:38.080
You're hurting me.

50:38.280 --> 50:41.000
Why didn't you save me?

50:45.520 --> 50:47.400
I'm dying, Katia!

50:48.280 --> 50:50.840
I protected you, I took you with me!

50:52.920 --> 50:56.040
I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.

50:56.240 --> 50:58.080
Then there's nothing I can do either!

50:58.840 --> 51:01.160
What the fuck are you gonna do?

51:01.360 --> 51:05.320
Stay here all alone in the world
without anyone, without me?

51:06.320 --> 51:08.120
You're going down with me.

51:09.200 --> 51:11.200
You're going down with me.

52:21.880 --> 52:23.360
What's your name?

52:26.040 --> 52:27.040
Katia.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.360
Why do they call you the Little Lady?

52:34.400 --> 52:36.200
Because I'm an adult

52:36.600 --> 52:38.400
and I'm not dead.

52:39.720 --> 52:41.640
How come you are alive?

52:44.200 --> 52:46.360
Because I'm a hermaphrodite.

52:49.320 --> 52:50.880
What does that mean?

52:52.840 --> 52:55.160
That I'm a man and a woman together.
