00:07.141 --> 00:09.210
Thom:
Previously on "Happyish"...

00:09.243 --> 00:10.711
Keebler talks about real.

00:10.744 --> 00:12.780
Real ingredients, real chips,
real, real, real,

00:12.813 --> 00:15.683
and yet these
are their spokespeople.

00:15.716 --> 00:17.218
Cartoons.

00:17.251 --> 00:18.686
( snaps fingers )

00:18.719 --> 00:21.155
Thom:
Holy shit. Midgets?

00:21.189 --> 00:22.156
Do midgets test well?

00:22.190 --> 00:24.392
- Top directors.
- Ken Burns.

00:24.425 --> 00:26.227
- Rob Reiner.
- Rob Reiner?

00:26.260 --> 00:30.098
We have an opportunity here
to do something that resonates.

00:30.131 --> 00:32.333
Think-- think Cassavetes.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.468
Uh, think
the Maysle brothers.

00:34.502 --> 00:37.405
- How's Fast Eddie?
- His fever's coming down.

00:37.438 --> 00:39.473
We're not out
of the woods yet,
though, but we're close.

00:39.507 --> 00:40.708
Fast Eddie.

00:40.741 --> 00:42.543
You feeling
better, son?

00:42.576 --> 00:44.545
Okay, that-- that's good.

00:44.578 --> 00:47.381
I love it. I love it.
Now let's try it again.

00:47.415 --> 00:49.417
46 fucking years
I gave that company.

00:49.450 --> 00:52.120
Ernie, Ernie,
no one's gonna fire you.

00:52.153 --> 00:53.387
You fucking pussy.

00:53.421 --> 00:54.822
You'll be lucky
if they don't fire you.

00:54.855 --> 00:55.789
( gunshot )

01:01.329 --> 01:03.364
Thom:
It's only for five days.

01:03.397 --> 01:04.698
I'll be back
before you know it.

01:04.732 --> 01:07.235
- But why?
- Because it's my job.

01:07.268 --> 01:09.137
Because, you know, it's--
I make commercials,

01:09.170 --> 01:11.272
and they make commercials
in Los Angeles.

01:11.305 --> 01:13.641
But you were just there.

01:13.674 --> 01:16.244
I know, and I hate
going away.

01:16.277 --> 01:18.446
I really do,
but it's only
for a few days.

01:18.479 --> 01:21.315
Until my friend
Gottfrid comes,
and he can take over.

01:21.349 --> 01:24.118
But you said
Gottfrid was an asshole.

01:24.152 --> 01:26.354
Okay, you don't use
language like that.

01:26.387 --> 01:29.357
You know,
I used that word once
and I shouldn't have.

01:31.325 --> 01:33.727
Hey, I wonder if they have
toy stores in Los Angeles.

01:33.761 --> 01:37.131
Well, can you get me
a surprise?

01:37.165 --> 01:39.333
Well, that's if they have
toy stores in Los Angeles.

01:39.367 --> 01:42.303
- iPad! iPad! iPad!
- iPad? Hang on, dude.
We-- we talked about this.

01:42.336 --> 01:44.205
You're too young to have
an iPad all to yourself.

01:44.238 --> 01:45.773
But Fitzgerald has one.

01:45.806 --> 01:47.741
Does that make him
any happier?

01:47.775 --> 01:49.710
Uh, yes?

01:49.743 --> 01:54.182
- ( laughing )
- It does, Dad.

01:54.215 --> 01:55.816
Come on, let's go.

01:55.849 --> 01:57.651
Come on.

01:59.420 --> 02:02.356
Okay. I'm gonna
get you something, okay?

02:02.390 --> 02:04.325
If they have
toy stores there.

02:04.358 --> 02:06.527
- Dad.
- You know something?

02:06.560 --> 02:08.929
I'm gonna miss you
so, so much.

02:08.962 --> 02:12.132
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.903
Five days, okay?

02:15.936 --> 02:17.405
Promise?

02:17.438 --> 02:18.872
I promise.

02:21.775 --> 02:23.377
I'll be home soon, buddy.

02:25.413 --> 02:26.414
Okay.

02:26.447 --> 02:28.249
All right.
Thank you.

02:49.637 --> 02:52.806
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands *

02:52.840 --> 02:55.476
* If you're happy and you
know it, clap your hands *

02:55.509 --> 02:58.412
* If you're
happy and you know it,
then motherfucking show it *

02:58.446 --> 03:01.282
* If you're happy
and you know it, clap your
motherfucking hands *

03:01.315 --> 03:05.319
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands! *

03:05.353 --> 03:09.290
Thom:
You know who the first
marketing genius was?

03:09.323 --> 03:13.694
Jesus Christ,
chief marketing officer,
God Incorporated.

03:13.727 --> 03:16.564
His big campaign for God?
"We'll save you."

03:16.597 --> 03:18.232
Great campaign.
Went totally viral.

03:18.266 --> 03:22.470
Jesus was so good
that we still use
his marketing plan today.

03:22.503 --> 03:24.638
We'll save you
from death,

03:24.672 --> 03:27.375
misery, time.

03:27.408 --> 03:30.244
We'll even save
your dick.

03:30.278 --> 03:33.381
Jesus Christ himself didn't
even claim to save dicks.

03:33.414 --> 03:35.449
We have Mercedes now, God.

03:35.483 --> 03:37.585
We have
Porsche convertibles.

03:37.618 --> 03:40.220
We have LA.

03:47.027 --> 03:49.997
In 1963, legendary ad man
David Ogilvy

03:50.030 --> 03:53.367
published his "Confessions
of an Advertising Man."

03:55.636 --> 03:57.371
Three years later
in 1966,

03:57.405 --> 04:00.441
"Time" magazine declared
that God was dead.

04:00.474 --> 04:02.543
They were wrong, though.
He wasn't dead.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.011
He just went
out of business.

04:04.044 --> 04:05.779
Did the client approve
Rob's changes to wardrobe?

04:05.813 --> 04:06.880
We sent it to 'em
this morning.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.882
What changes
to the wardrobe?

04:08.916 --> 04:10.718
- Rob didn't like JJ's pants.
- That's not his call.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.620
We're checking with
the client, Mikal.
Relax.

04:12.653 --> 04:14.788
Anybody got a copy
of the script?

04:24.532 --> 04:26.734
Did the client approve
Rob's changes to the dialogue?

04:26.767 --> 04:27.735
We sent it to 'em
this morning.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.370
What changes
to the dialogue?

04:29.403 --> 04:31.372
Rob didn't like JJ's speech
about the cookie factory.

04:31.405 --> 04:32.706
It's not his call.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.908
We're checking with
the client, Mikal.
Relax.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.678
Does anybody have
a copy of the script?

04:37.711 --> 04:39.046
Hey. It's me.

04:39.079 --> 04:42.516
It's, uh, 6:30 a.m.,
"Beverly Hell" time,

04:42.550 --> 04:45.586
which, I guess that means
it's 9:30 where you--

04:45.619 --> 04:46.920
shit, you'll be
at school.

04:46.954 --> 04:49.056
I just wanted to say
good morning to Jules.

04:49.089 --> 04:51.091
But anyhow,
I have my bags,

04:51.124 --> 04:53.427
and I'll go straight
to the airport after the shoot.

04:53.461 --> 04:54.395
Call me. Bye.

04:56.730 --> 04:59.467
Hey,
thanks for staying.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.402
Wasn't my choice.

05:01.435 --> 05:02.936
Film looks great.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.972
It's not a film.
It's a commercial.

05:05.005 --> 05:07.408
Gottfrid's shitty commercial.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.109
And he should have
covered it himself.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.078
Well, he's on the last
flight out tonight.

05:11.111 --> 05:12.980
He'll be out here
while they cut it
and you'll be home.

05:13.013 --> 05:15.649
- What time's your flight?
- 7:00 p.m. LAX.

05:15.683 --> 05:17.050
- We'll get you there.
- Okay.

05:17.084 --> 05:20.120
And, remember,
however badly
you wanna go,

05:20.153 --> 05:22.923
it's not half as much
as we want you gone.

05:25.426 --> 05:28.562
( birds giggling )

05:28.596 --> 05:29.930
Hey, you know
how much this costs?

05:29.963 --> 05:31.098
Like, a thousand dollars.

05:31.131 --> 05:33.834
Like, $10,000.

05:33.867 --> 05:36.136
- Hey, guess what.
- What?

05:36.169 --> 05:38.706
- Guess who's coming
home tomorrow.
- Who?

05:38.739 --> 05:40.741
- Your dad, you silly.
- I know.

05:40.774 --> 05:42.109
Fitzgerald:
Hey, you can't play it.

05:42.142 --> 05:44.978
This has a retina display.
Did you know that?

05:45.012 --> 05:47.715
It's, like,
a million resolutions.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.149
He's been gone
a long time, huh?

05:49.182 --> 05:50.651
Fitzgerald:
We're a Mac family.

05:50.684 --> 05:51.952
I bet you're not
a Mac family.

05:51.985 --> 05:53.554
'Cause we think
different.

05:53.587 --> 05:54.788
I bet you don't
think different.

05:54.822 --> 05:56.390
Hey, you know
what I was thinking?

05:56.424 --> 05:58.992
I was thinking maybe we have
a surprise party for him, hmm?

05:59.026 --> 06:01.862
He doesn't get
home until the morning,
but I thought maybe--

06:01.895 --> 06:04.698
maybe we could set up for it
after school today?

06:04.732 --> 06:06.434
Right?
Make a sign?

06:06.467 --> 06:08.802
Maybe you could
blow up some balloons?

06:08.836 --> 06:10.671
You think Dad
would like it?

06:10.704 --> 06:12.840
- Julius: Okay.
- Lee: Okay.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.875
Dude, come here.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.477
I love you.

06:16.510 --> 06:18.446
I love you too, Mom.

06:20.180 --> 06:22.950
Fitzgerald:
My dad has one, too.
And my mom.

06:27.521 --> 06:29.156
( chatter )

06:29.189 --> 06:32.460
- ( sighs )
- Man: Hey, Mr. Reiner.

06:37.865 --> 06:40.067
Man:
Last looks are up.

06:43.203 --> 06:44.905
Hey, Lee, it's me.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.540
Um, where are you?

06:46.574 --> 06:50.143
I've been calling you
all morning, and, um...

06:50.177 --> 06:51.645
you know, just--

06:51.679 --> 06:54.915
well, I'm in hell,
so call me.

06:54.948 --> 06:56.517
Man:
We're losing light, people.

06:56.550 --> 06:58.686
The client doesn't
like JJ's delivery.

06:58.719 --> 07:00.621
I know, that's--
I told Reiner.

07:00.654 --> 07:02.656
Debbie:
They think
he's too miserable.

07:02.690 --> 07:03.757
That's what
I just told Reiner.

07:03.791 --> 07:04.858
Go tell him again.

07:04.892 --> 07:05.926
I'm trying
not to piss him off.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.895
That was
take 15, Thom.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.863
You're the one who has
to be out of here by 5:00.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.899
Man:
Roll sound.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.902
- Roll camera.
- Ready? And action.

07:29.517 --> 07:30.584
Knock, knock.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.922
Cookie for your thoughts.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.757
JJ:
Went to the factory
today, Pop.

07:36.790 --> 07:39.092
Cookie Manufacturers
International.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.994
You should see the setup
they have there--

07:41.028 --> 07:43.697
robots, machines.

07:43.731 --> 07:46.099
Gonna put us
out of business, Pop.
I know it.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.569
And after all
your hard work, Pop,

07:48.602 --> 07:49.670
it ain't right.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.238
It ain't right, Pop.

07:51.271 --> 07:52.205
Listen to me, JJ.

07:52.239 --> 07:55.709
We have something
they can never compete with.

07:55.743 --> 07:57.277
What's that?

07:57.310 --> 07:58.478
Love.

08:04.885 --> 08:06.520
( spitting )

08:07.855 --> 08:09.757
Is this a fucking cookie?!

08:09.790 --> 08:11.525
Fuck.

08:11.559 --> 08:14.728
- I'm gluten intolerant,
you shit heel!
- Man: Cut!

08:14.762 --> 08:16.864
Ernie:
How many fucking times
have I told you

08:16.897 --> 08:18.298
no actual cookies?!

08:18.331 --> 08:20.067
Man: Props.
Where the fuck is props?

08:20.100 --> 08:23.704
Do you know what wheat does
to my fucking stom-- oh.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.806
- Oh, God.
- ( farting )

08:25.839 --> 08:27.274
Oh, God.
I need a toilet.

08:27.307 --> 08:29.142
Oh, God.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.711
I need a fucking toilet!

08:30.744 --> 08:32.012
( groans )

08:32.045 --> 08:33.046
Man:
Stand, people.

08:33.080 --> 08:36.650
( groaning )
Wardrobe!

08:36.684 --> 08:37.985
- Wardrobe!
- Fuck!

08:38.018 --> 08:39.152
Red leather,
yellow leather.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.153
Red leather,
yellow leather.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.122
Brown leather.
Aah!

08:42.155 --> 08:45.058
- So it can't be fixed?
- Well, it's off warranty.

08:45.092 --> 08:47.060
And by the time
you send it back
and they fix it,

08:47.094 --> 08:49.597
it's probably cheaper
to just get a new one.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.164
Okay, how much
is that gonna cost me?

08:51.198 --> 08:52.900
Do you wanna stay
with a BlackBerry?

08:52.933 --> 08:54.001
Are you
a BlackBerry person?

08:54.034 --> 08:55.569
Am I a BlackBerry
person?

08:55.603 --> 08:57.204
No, I'm not
a BlackBerry person.

08:57.237 --> 09:00.974
Because, honestly,
for the money, I would
go with the iPhone.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.142
We're having
a special this week--

09:02.175 --> 09:03.777
Okay.
Okay, listen to me.

09:03.811 --> 09:07.014
Are we dating?
Have we gone dancing?
Gone out to dinner?

09:07.047 --> 09:08.949
No, so don't try
to fuck me.

09:08.982 --> 09:10.618
I know all the games.
I know the tricks.

09:10.651 --> 09:11.885
So I'm gonna ask you
really nicely.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.153
Do not try to fuck me.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.122
I will not try that.

09:15.155 --> 09:17.190
Okay, thank you.
Sorry, I'm just--

09:17.224 --> 09:19.893
- It's stressful.
- Yeah, it is.

09:19.927 --> 09:21.929
I know. I go crazy
when my phone dies.

09:21.962 --> 09:24.331
- Do you wanna
look at the iPhone?
- No, I don't want an iPhone.

09:24.364 --> 09:26.600
- They're very popular.
- That's why I don't want one.

09:26.634 --> 09:28.135
Okay, well, let's just see
what else we have.

09:28.168 --> 09:29.837
- Great.
- Okay.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.011
Dour?
What does that mean, dour?

09:38.045 --> 09:40.313
It means gloomy,
glum, morose.

09:40.347 --> 09:42.015
No, I know what
the fucking word--

09:42.049 --> 09:43.617
He's playing it like
it's Shakespeare, Thom.

09:43.651 --> 09:45.285
- They want him less down.
- Okay, okay, all right.

09:45.318 --> 09:47.921
His father works
day and night.

09:47.955 --> 09:50.323
- He's about to lose his job,
so I don't know how happy--
- They're elves.

09:50.357 --> 09:52.125
I thought they wanted it
more fucking real!

09:52.159 --> 09:53.360
- That was the whole point
of this.
- Shh.

09:53.393 --> 09:54.962
Let's go talk
to the client, then.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.664
Okay, I need--
that taxi to the airport

09:56.697 --> 09:58.365
- needs to be here
in two hours.
- Okay, okay.

09:58.398 --> 09:59.833
Come and talk
to the client.

09:59.867 --> 10:01.101
- Two fucking hours.
- Shh!

10:01.134 --> 10:02.202
Thom: Hey.
How you doing?

10:02.235 --> 10:04.705
Good to see you
again.

10:04.738 --> 10:07.875
Man:
Picture's up.
Roll sound.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.176
- Roll camera.
- Okay.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.679
- Ready, and--
- Whoa. Whoa, sorry.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.246
- What? What?
What? What?
- Cut.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.783
The client thinks
that JJ is a bit too dour.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.951
- Dour?
- Down.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.386
I know
what "dour" means.

10:19.419 --> 10:22.089
Yeah. I think they
just want him up a bit.

10:23.691 --> 10:25.759
His father is about
to be laid off.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.127
I know.
I explained that.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.329
- He works night and day.
- I understand that.

10:29.362 --> 10:32.065
- I have Laker tickets tonight.
- Okay, I didn't know that.

10:32.099 --> 10:33.734
Yeah. Are you gonna
fuck up my Laker tickets?

10:33.767 --> 10:35.135
- No, Rob. No.
- No?

10:35.168 --> 10:37.137
I think
you should just lift him--
just make him be up.

10:37.170 --> 10:40.674
- That would solve it.
- Yeah? You want him up?

10:40.708 --> 10:42.409
- You tell him.
- Rob, you're the director.

10:42.442 --> 10:46.013
Yeah. Yeah.
Well, the guy
is a fucking asshole.

10:46.046 --> 10:47.881
You want him up,
you tell him.

10:47.915 --> 10:49.316
Tell me what, Reiner?

10:49.349 --> 10:51.985
Uh, you know
that last take
was great...

10:52.019 --> 10:53.754
- Oh, here we go.
- No, no, no, no.

10:53.787 --> 10:57.157
I just was thinking
that maybe the next time

10:57.190 --> 10:58.425
we try it--
I don't know.

10:58.458 --> 11:02.062
How do you say it?
A little bit more up.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.264
My father's
getting laid off.

11:04.297 --> 11:06.233
Yeah, we both actually
talked about that,

11:06.266 --> 11:07.367
but we-- I--
well, I think--

11:07.400 --> 11:09.369
No, asshole,
you don't think.

11:09.402 --> 11:12.773
I am a classically-trained
actor, okay?

11:12.806 --> 11:14.808
You wanna know where I was
last week this time?

11:14.842 --> 11:18.712
Off-Broadway
playing Willy Loman,
that's where.

11:18.746 --> 11:21.048
So I think
I know how to play
a fuckin' layoff scene.

11:21.081 --> 11:22.215
Fair enough.

11:22.249 --> 11:23.817
But we thought if you--

11:23.851 --> 11:25.418
instead of playing JJ down,

11:25.452 --> 11:27.220
you're trying
to cheer Ernie up.

11:27.254 --> 11:30.323
Who the fuck is directing
this piece of shit?

11:30.357 --> 11:33.260
You, pinhead,
or that pinhead?

11:33.293 --> 11:34.962
You know what?
Don't tell me.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.229
I'm fuckin' out of here.

11:36.263 --> 11:38.198
I knew it!
I knew it!

11:38.231 --> 11:40.467
There goes
my fuckin' Laker game!

11:40.500 --> 11:42.803
Thank you!

11:42.836 --> 11:44.972
All right,
take five.

11:52.946 --> 11:55.849
( engine revving )

11:57.250 --> 11:59.219
( brakes squealing )

11:59.252 --> 12:00.353
What the fuck is this?

12:00.387 --> 12:02.355
Keeping up
with the Keeblers, baby.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.524
- I love LA.
- Both: We love it.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.226
Guys, you've been
in LA five days.

12:06.259 --> 12:08.095
You're out of a job.
Do you realize that?

12:08.128 --> 12:10.230
Nobody in LA
has a job, Thom.

12:10.263 --> 12:13.100
But everybody has
great hair and fancy cars.

12:13.133 --> 12:15.502
Besides, we really
cleaned up on this deal.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.470
Our agents got us
serious cash

12:17.504 --> 12:20.073
for using our likenesses,
plus residuals,

12:20.107 --> 12:21.942
payouts,
the whole deal!

12:21.975 --> 12:23.143
And this is what
you spend it on?

12:23.176 --> 12:25.078
Materialistic bullshit.

12:25.112 --> 12:27.514
Ma, do you-- wait.
What are those?

12:27.547 --> 12:29.983
Saline.
Under the muscle.

12:30.017 --> 12:33.420
Same doctor who does
all the celebrities' boobs.

12:33.453 --> 12:35.789
- Hey, check it out, Thom.
- Very nice, JJ.

12:35.823 --> 12:36.924
( both grunting )

12:36.957 --> 12:38.558
We got a whole trunk
full of 'em.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.393
( laughs )

12:40.427 --> 12:42.195
Is this the way you wanna
be raising your kids?

12:42.229 --> 12:44.131
Happy? Yes.

12:44.164 --> 12:45.532
Does Julius have an iPad?

12:45.565 --> 12:47.534
So that's how you
measure happiness, yeah?

12:47.567 --> 12:50.303
I mean, you should be
teaching them that happiness
can't be bought.

12:50.337 --> 12:54.274
We worked in that tree
for 40 years, Thom.

12:54.307 --> 12:56.409
This is
the American dream--

12:56.443 --> 13:00.814
work hard,
buy a luxury car,
and get some new tits.

13:00.848 --> 13:02.249
Gotta go, Thom.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.151
We're getting spray-tanned
before the Lakers game.

13:04.184 --> 13:07.387
Our agents got us
court-side seats!

13:07.420 --> 13:09.389
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

13:10.623 --> 13:12.092
( sighs )

13:12.125 --> 13:14.527
I gotta get
the fuck out of here.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.997
Saleswoman:
Let's see what we've got.

13:17.030 --> 13:19.366
We have
the silver iPhone 6

13:19.399 --> 13:21.434
with HD retina display,

13:21.468 --> 13:24.537
eight mega pixel
eyesight camera
and charger

13:24.571 --> 13:27.507
and you got the Verizon
"More Everything" plan

13:27.540 --> 13:30.243
with unlimited talk and text
on the 4G LTE network,

13:30.277 --> 13:33.113
and you also got
the LG Tone wireless headset

13:33.146 --> 13:35.182
with ambient noise reduction.

13:35.215 --> 13:39.586
Oh, hey, do you wanna look
at any of the protective
cases we have?

13:42.122 --> 13:43.323
Yes.

13:43.356 --> 13:44.925
You really do wanna
protect your investment.

13:44.958 --> 13:46.226
I do.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.061
I really do wanna
protect my investment.

13:48.095 --> 13:50.597
- Okay.
- Okay.

13:50.630 --> 13:52.365
Okay.

13:55.635 --> 13:58.438
Fitzgerald's iPad
is so cool.

13:58.471 --> 14:00.340
Julius, you're not
getting an iPad.

14:00.373 --> 14:02.109
- I know, Mom.
- Okay.

14:02.142 --> 14:06.613
We were playing this game
where you're the birds, right?

14:06.646 --> 14:09.883
- And these pigs
stole your eggs.
- Wow.

14:09.917 --> 14:13.954
And you use your fingers
to launch the birds
right on the screen.

14:13.987 --> 14:16.556
- Cool.
- And there's
this other one

14:16.589 --> 14:19.226
- where you can race
the pigs on a go-kart...
- Really?

14:19.259 --> 14:23.030
...and when
you turn the iPad,
that's how you steer.

14:23.063 --> 14:26.199
Dude!
This is amazing!

14:26.233 --> 14:28.168
Dad is gonna
love this.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.437
Should we put it up?
All right.

14:31.939 --> 14:34.307
Nicely done.

14:34.341 --> 14:38.311
So Fitzgerald
lets you play his iPad?

14:38.345 --> 14:40.347
No, I was watching
Ross play.

14:40.380 --> 14:43.650
- So he let Ross play?
- Uh-huh.

14:43.683 --> 14:45.185
Mm.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.087
Did he let
any other kids play?

14:47.120 --> 14:50.257
Most of the kids.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.192
So he let most of the kids
play but not you?

14:52.225 --> 14:53.927
He never lets me play.

14:53.961 --> 14:55.662
Well, you know what?

14:55.695 --> 14:57.430
He's a big jerk.

15:02.202 --> 15:04.137
( sighs )

15:04.171 --> 15:05.705
Come here, man.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.274
Look at that.

15:07.307 --> 15:10.143
Look how beautiful
that is.

15:10.177 --> 15:11.778
Dad's gonna love it.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.384
Look, let me
tell you something.

15:17.417 --> 15:20.687
I love this,
and I hate commercials.

15:20.720 --> 15:24.491
I hate my whole life
making commercials,
but I love this.

15:24.524 --> 15:26.693
And let me tell you why.
( clears throat )

15:26.726 --> 15:29.496
I know it's a bullshit
cookie commercial,

15:29.529 --> 15:31.231
but I think
it's more than that,

15:31.264 --> 15:34.367
because I believe
that Ernie Keebler

15:34.401 --> 15:37.004
is Willy Loman.

15:37.037 --> 15:38.271
Oh, please.

15:38.305 --> 15:40.707
Do you think
the factory down the road
gives a shit about him?

15:40.740 --> 15:43.743
This whole campaign
is-- is-- is--

15:43.776 --> 15:46.980
uh, is about
corporate imperialism.

15:47.014 --> 15:48.581
It's about
the ordinary working guy

15:48.615 --> 15:49.749
who's just trying to put
some food on the table,

15:49.782 --> 15:51.551
just trying
to feed his kids,

15:51.584 --> 15:54.054
but he can't compete
with the corporate cartels

15:54.087 --> 15:56.189
who will not be satisfied
until they have every
last penny,

15:56.223 --> 15:57.224
and that's why
I wrote this.

15:57.257 --> 15:58.591
You wrote
this piece of shit?

15:58.625 --> 16:00.093
You're damn right I did.

16:00.127 --> 16:02.262
I said to the guys,
"No more animated characters.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.097
We need real.
I need real.

16:04.131 --> 16:07.067
You know,
I need Rob Reiner
to direct this

16:07.100 --> 16:12.172
and I need the guy
that played Trigorin
in 'The Seagull' to play JJ."

16:15.275 --> 16:18.745
You saw me
in "The Seagull"?

16:18.778 --> 16:20.347
I'm a Chekov fan.

16:20.380 --> 16:21.714
At the Atlantic?

16:21.748 --> 16:23.516
Yeah. Yeah.
I mean, absolutely.

16:23.550 --> 16:25.085
And I shouldn't say this,

16:25.118 --> 16:26.719
'cause you busted
my fuckin' ass before,

16:26.753 --> 16:30.090
but, uh, you were all
anybody saw in that play.

16:30.123 --> 16:31.658
( knock at door )

16:32.759 --> 16:34.394
Thom, your car
to the airport's here.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.263
Okay.

16:36.296 --> 16:40.067
Attention must be paid,
even to an elf.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.403
Let's do this.

16:43.436 --> 16:46.706
Okay. Okay.

16:46.739 --> 16:48.641
Don't say goodbye
to Reiner for me.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.643
I won't even
say goodbye for me.

16:50.677 --> 16:53.513
Oh, thanks for
the Chekov "Seagull" thing.
He totally bought it.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.715
- You can't go, Thom.
- Can't go where?

16:55.748 --> 16:58.318
- I'm sorry, Thom.
That was Lorna.
- Don't start with me, Deb.

16:58.351 --> 17:01.254
It's one wide
and a couple of close-ups.
Reiner can handle it.

17:01.288 --> 17:03.256
Flight's in two hours.
That's plenty of time.

17:03.290 --> 17:05.725
It's not about
the flight, Thom.
It's Gottfrid.

17:08.161 --> 17:11.664
He's got a dinner tonight
at the advertising club and
another one tomorrow.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.400
He wants you
to cover the edit.

17:13.433 --> 17:15.302
Said he'd be out here
first thing next week.

17:15.335 --> 17:16.603
- No.
- I'm sorry, Thom.

17:16.636 --> 17:17.804
I know you wanna
get home to your--

17:17.837 --> 17:19.406
You don't know--
what the fuck do you--

17:19.439 --> 17:20.773
Hey, you guys.
I'm gonna split.

17:20.807 --> 17:22.375
You know, I got
the Laker tickets.

17:22.409 --> 17:24.377
But you're okay.
You got JJ up in the tree.

17:24.411 --> 17:27.414
- Uh-huh.
- You got a wide shot
and a couple of close-ups.

17:27.447 --> 17:29.649
Charlie should be able
to handle it, okay?

17:29.682 --> 17:30.583
Bye.

17:31.751 --> 17:33.286
- We're not done.
- Debbie: Thom.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.587
- What?
- We're not done.

17:34.621 --> 17:36.123
You don't leave
until we're done.

17:36.156 --> 17:39.526
But you got
just a wide shot
and some close-ups.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.094
Yeah, Charlie
can handle that, Thom.

17:41.128 --> 17:42.762
Get back there
and finish the job.

17:44.797 --> 17:46.666
Do you know
who you're talking to?

17:46.699 --> 17:48.568
I'm talking to the director
of this goddamn commercial,

17:48.601 --> 17:50.503
the one that's being paid
$30,000 a day.

17:50.537 --> 17:51.838
The one who's gonna
get his fat ass back there

17:51.871 --> 17:53.506
and finish
the fuckin' job!

17:53.540 --> 17:55.175
Fuck you, Thom.

17:55.208 --> 17:58.478
You don't wanna be here
any more than I do.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.447
Thom, what is
the failed dream, huh?

18:00.480 --> 18:03.716
What is it?
It's a screenplay, a novel?

18:03.750 --> 18:07.187
You go write that,
get off my fuckin' back,

18:07.220 --> 18:10.757
and stop acting like
this shit matters, hmm?

18:14.294 --> 18:16.296
( car door opens, closes )

18:16.329 --> 18:18.231
( engine starts )

18:25.605 --> 18:27.874
- Lee: Hey. This day.
- Finally.

18:27.907 --> 18:30.277
I've tried you
a dozen fucking times.

18:30.310 --> 18:31.744
Oh, Jesus.
People.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.380
Oh, I was
at the phone store.

18:33.413 --> 18:35.382
- My phone died.
- All day?

18:35.415 --> 18:36.883
Your phone's
been dead all day?

18:36.916 --> 18:38.751
Where were you?
Were you at the studio?

18:38.785 --> 18:40.620
No, I was at
the phone store, Thom.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.355
Well, I wasn't
at my studio.

18:42.389 --> 18:44.724
I don't have a studio,
'cause all I have is work!

18:44.757 --> 18:46.759
I'm gonna die here
alone in a hotel room

18:46.793 --> 18:49.496
surrounded by
bulimic assholes

18:49.529 --> 18:52.699
and fucking
Keebler cookie scripts.

18:52.732 --> 18:55.235
What's wrong with you, Thom?
What's-- where are you?

18:55.268 --> 18:57.504
I'm at the hotel.
I'm at the fucking hotel.

18:57.537 --> 18:59.172
That's where I am.

18:59.206 --> 19:00.640
Thom.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.141
I'm not coming home.

19:03.243 --> 19:04.511
Is it Gottfrid?

19:04.544 --> 19:06.279
He's sucking some
ad dick in New York

19:06.313 --> 19:09.382
and I've gotta
stay here till--
till next week.

19:09.416 --> 19:11.251
( footsteps )

19:11.284 --> 19:12.652
Lee: Ugh.

19:12.685 --> 19:14.654
- Hey.
- Let me talk to Jules.

19:14.687 --> 19:15.955
I'll-- I can tell him.

19:15.988 --> 19:19.292
No, no, I'll tell him.
I'll tell him.

19:19.326 --> 19:20.927
Okay.
It's your daddy.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.496
Hi, Daddy.
Are you on the plane?

19:23.530 --> 19:25.532
No, I'm not, buddy.

19:25.565 --> 19:27.700
- How come?
- I'm so sorry.

19:27.734 --> 19:30.837
I'm still here.
They-- I can't get home.

19:30.870 --> 19:33.673
I've got to do my job
and they won't let me

19:33.706 --> 19:35.842
go home right away
till I finish, yeah?

19:35.875 --> 19:37.544
But I'm gonna
be home next week,

19:37.577 --> 19:41.548
and, uh, so, you know,
I'll see you then, okay?

19:41.581 --> 19:43.783
I'm-- I'm really sorry,
buddy.

19:44.984 --> 19:46.353
Jules?

19:46.386 --> 19:48.288
Jules?

19:48.321 --> 19:50.323
( phone clatters )

20:01.934 --> 20:03.002
Fuck!

20:03.035 --> 20:05.638
Hey, it's okay
to be angry, buddy.

20:05.672 --> 20:08.675
I'm not angry.

20:08.708 --> 20:11.311
Everybody gets angry.

20:11.344 --> 20:14.781
You know, I bet your dad
threw his phone down, too.

20:14.814 --> 20:17.717
- ( dog whines )
- Hey, you know what?

20:17.750 --> 20:20.387
I bet if you close
your eyes,

20:20.420 --> 20:24.591
pictured your daddy
coming home and giving
you a big, big hug,

20:24.624 --> 20:26.459
it'd make you feel
so much better.

20:26.493 --> 20:30.430
- Mm-mm.
- No? Hmm.

20:30.463 --> 20:33.032
What if you closed
your eyes

20:33.065 --> 20:37.370
and pictured Gottfrid
getting hit by a truck?

20:37.404 --> 20:39.672
- ( laughs )
- Would that make
you feel better?

20:39.706 --> 20:42.709
- No.
- Oh, really?

20:42.742 --> 20:44.711
What if you closed
your eyes

20:44.744 --> 20:48.781
and pictured Gottfrid
opening his office window

20:48.815 --> 20:54.020
and falling
all the way down?

20:54.053 --> 20:55.322
Splat!

20:55.355 --> 20:56.756
- Uh, no.
- No?

20:56.789 --> 21:00.827
All the way down!
And splat.

21:03.496 --> 21:04.764
Let's go make
some brownies.

21:04.797 --> 21:06.599
Come on.
Whoa!

21:06.633 --> 21:07.967
All right, then.

21:20.380 --> 21:23.383
Hey, Thom.
I'm just stopping by
for a pre-game drink.

21:23.416 --> 21:24.984
- How'd the shoot go?
- Film looks great.

21:25.017 --> 21:28.054
- Director's a piece of shit.
- Sounds great.

21:32.091 --> 21:33.560
Ernie?

21:36.596 --> 21:38.798
Ernie!

21:38.831 --> 21:41.368
Ernie! Ernie!

21:42.702 --> 21:45.338
Ernie! Ernie.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.341
Ernie.

21:48.375 --> 21:49.809
( groans )

21:49.842 --> 21:51.978
- Ernie!
- ( groans )

21:52.011 --> 21:53.546
What are you doing?
Let go!

21:53.580 --> 21:55.348
I don't want
to leave, Thom.

21:55.382 --> 21:57.350
I've never been happier.

21:57.384 --> 21:58.718
But what about Ma?

21:58.751 --> 22:00.820
What about the children,
the boys?

22:00.853 --> 22:03.122
Yeah, it's something,
isn't it?

22:03.155 --> 22:04.791
Just a bunch of elves.

22:04.824 --> 22:07.660
And here we are
in a Rolls.

22:07.694 --> 22:09.629
We made it, Thom.

22:09.662 --> 22:12.331
We made it.

22:21.641 --> 22:23.443
- Hey.
- Yeah.

22:23.476 --> 22:25.445
- Hundred bucks if you
let me piss on it.
- ( laughs )

22:25.478 --> 22:27.914
Seriously.
You'll feel better.
I'll feel better.

22:27.947 --> 22:30.016
- ( scoffs )
- Hundred bucks.
Right now.

22:30.049 --> 22:31.818
500.

23:16.863 --> 23:19.165
( urinating )

23:45.257 --> 23:48.127
Thom:
It's not LA.
I know that.

23:51.698 --> 23:54.534
It's us.

23:54.567 --> 23:57.003
We're just looking
for some relief.

23:57.036 --> 23:59.639
We're just looking
for a new religion.

23:59.672 --> 24:01.774
( choir singing )

24:06.679 --> 24:09.048
And so I enter,
head bowed,

24:09.081 --> 24:11.618
to the church of America,

24:11.651 --> 24:14.821
where the faithful raise up
their voices as one

24:14.854 --> 24:17.857
in a song
of thanks and cheer.

24:17.890 --> 24:20.226
And not
a dour face among them,

24:20.259 --> 24:24.063
for behold,
the iPhone 6 Plus
has appeared,

24:24.096 --> 24:28.935
and lo, the screen size
is much greater than before.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.903
Man: Okay, so that's
one iPhone 6 Plus,

24:30.937 --> 24:33.139
128 gigs,
mobile package,

24:33.172 --> 24:35.508
and from the looks
of your last phone,

24:35.542 --> 24:38.678
you'll definitely want
the additional two years
of damage coverage.

24:38.711 --> 24:41.280
And then we have
the iPad Mini 3
for your son,

24:41.313 --> 24:43.750
and that's 64 gigs
with retina display,

24:43.783 --> 24:45.585
Wi-Fi and cellular.

24:45.618 --> 24:46.753
Since he's young,

24:46.786 --> 24:49.522
I would recommend getting
a protector for it.

24:49.556 --> 24:51.591
- Uh--
- Would you like to get
a protector today?

24:51.624 --> 24:53.259
Yes.

24:53.292 --> 24:55.595
I'd like to get
a protector today.

24:55.628 --> 24:57.296
Great.

24:57.329 --> 25:02.034
Thom:
And let us say, "Amen."

25:02.068 --> 25:04.203
( bell tolling )

25:04.236 --> 25:07.173
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands *

25:07.206 --> 25:09.742

25:09.776 --> 25:12.612

25:37.303 --> 25:39.972

25:40.006 --> 25:42.842
* If you're happy

clap your hands *

25:42.875 --> 25:45.645
* If you're
happy and you know it,
then motherfucking show it *

25:45.678 --> 25:48.114
* If you're happy

motherfucking hands *

25:48.147 --> 25:50.983

25:51.017 --> 25:54.787
