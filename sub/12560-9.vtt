I'm competing today.

03:39.710 --> 03:45.640
And even if i weren't,i'd rather be trampled by a
packof wild shetland ponies than have drink with him.

03:45.680 --> 03:47.000
You don't have to be rude.

03:47.070 --> 03:50.940
I was merely complimenting you on
how fetching you lookin that getup.

03:50.950 --> 03:52.970
Like an indian liz taylor.

03:53.570 --> 03:54.860
Dude,let's class it up a bit.

03:54.870 --> 03:57.350
This is a hamptons
horse show,not a rodeo.

A lot of people hide
theircareers from their parents.

Like,uh,hitmen do it.

04:43.830 --> 04:46.940

04:51.270 --> 04:54.340
They have a strict senseof
what my career should be.

04:54.580 --> 04:56.450
Being a p.A. Is not part of it.

04:56.980 --> 05:01.750

He fell on his extended,abducted arm.

06:43.650 --> 06:44.870

Probably something i ate.

09:35.460 --> 09:37.130
And,no,i'm not pregnant.

09:37.860 --> 09:40.020
Do you have fever,abdominal
cramps,rapid heart rate?

09:40.040 --> 09:41.830
This an ad for someold person drug?

Look,if it'sfood poisoning,it can
get a lot worsethan just throwing up.

09:45.180 --> 09:47.500
Beth just gets
nervousbefore she competes.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.190
I don't get nervous.I freak out.

09:49.260 --> 09:51.000
Do you usually throw
upwhen you freak out?

09:51.020 --> 09:53.700
My dad says i

Where is your fatherand mother?

09:55.070 --> 09:56.050
I'd like to speakwith them.

09:56.190 --> 09:58.910
Beth's dad is the stable manager.He's
probably around somewhere.

09:59.410 --> 10:00.660
Well,i'd like to get his sign off.

10:00.670 --> 10:01.780
My event's in eight minutes.

10:01.790 --> 10:04.210
They're not gonna take a
doctor's note if i'm late.

10:04.700 --> 10:06.310
All right,your heart rate is fine.

10:06.330 --> 10:09.550
I can give you somethingto calm your
stomach and hopefully your freaking out.

10:11.790 --> 10:12.750
What are you doing?

10:12.770 --> 10:14.110
- It's okay,dad.
- I'm dr.Lawson.

10:14.120 --> 10:15.370
I don't care who you are.

10:15.400 --> 10:18.730
You have no rightto give my daughter
anything withoutmy permission.

10:18.750 --> 10:20.290
It's just somethingto
settle her stomach.

10:20.300 --> 10:22.200
Beth was sick,mr.Samuels.

10:22.240 --> 10:24.430
You're not sick,are you?

10:25.290 --> 10:26.700
No,dad.I'm fine.

10:26.780 --> 10:28.740
Okay.So why are you here?

10:28.770 --> 10:30.550
'Cause i was toldyour daughter was ill.

10:32.140 --> 10:33.300
Thank you,madison.

10:33.450 --> 10:34.580
Dad,she was just tryingto be nice.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.250
Yeah,i'm surethat she was.

10:37.090 --> 10:38.440
Can i talk to youfor a second?

10:38.970 --> 10:43.000
Look.I know that it looks like the
cover of town and country around here,

10:43.110 --> 10:45.600
but riding is cutthroatand competitive.

10:45.650 --> 10:48.850
Beth is a target becauseshe's
good at what she does.

10:49.290 --> 10:51.010
And she's not likethese other girls.

10:51.040 --> 10:52.150
Your daughter threw up.

10:52.160 --> 10:54.500
She gets nervousbefore she competes.

10:54.510 --> 10:56.820
She has since she was a little girl.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.830
Look,i know you're trying to be helpful.

10:58.860 --> 11:01.470
Beth doesn't need a doctor
to settle her stomach.

11:01.490 --> 11:03.930
What she needs is a blue ribbon.

11:07.840 --> 11:09.350
Good luckin your events,beth.

11:09.540 --> 11:10.910
I'll be rooting for you.

11:27.890 --> 11:30.210
It's bigger.It's much bigger.

11:30.230 --> 11:32.030
The future of hank med
could hang in the balance.

11:32.050 --> 11:33.390
What are you talking about?

11:33.400 --> 11:34.820
I'm talking about jank.

11:35.250 --> 11:35.980
Jank?

11:35.990 --> 11:38.180
Jill and hank.Henceforth,just
to be known as "jank.

11:38.200 --> 11:42.600
It's less confusingthan
"hill" or i'm sorry.

11:43.710 --> 11:45.180
Pick a lane,sister.

11:46.440 --> 11:47.940
So you may not know this.

11:47.950 --> 11:52.730
But one of the reasonswhy hank decided to stay
in the hamptons,other than me of course,was jill.

11:52.770 --> 11:56.920
Oh,so now you thinkbecause they
split,he has less reason to stay.

11:56.970 --> 11:59.260
Protect jank,protect hankmed.

11:59.350 --> 12:00.320
Interesting.

12:00.350 --> 12:02.860
So what do youthink we should do?

12:03.230 --> 12:04.730
Two things.

12:05.070 --> 12:08.700
Stay outof their business
and don't call them jank.

12:08.720 --> 12:09.410
Well,i'm

12:09.430 --> 12:11.050
Mommy,daddy!

12:11.060 --> 12:12.440
Hello,divya.

12:12.470 --> 12:13.400
Did we miss anything?

12:13.420 --> 12:14.820
Oh,just the first event.

12:14.840 --> 12:15.890
Which she nailed,by the way.

12:15.920 --> 12:19.260
******That filly really
sailedabove the rails.

12:19.410 --> 12:23.080
By "filly,"i meant the
horse,obviously,not your daughter.

12:23.170 --> 12:23.950
Who are you?

12:23.980 --> 12:28.620
I'm evan r.Lawson,c  c  
see how great divya looks?

12:28.630 --> 12:29.540
I mean,look at that.

12:29.560 --> 12:31.560
She's like an indianliz taylor,right?

12:31.600 --> 12:36.210
Evan,these are my parents,devesh
and rubina katdare.

12:36.280 --> 12:37.900
This is evan.

12:38.140 --> 12:38.840
Pleasure.

12:38.870 --> 12:41.000
My...Friend.

12:41.030 --> 12:42.730
How do you twoknow each other?

12:42.800 --> 12:44.790
We go to wharton together.

12:45.380 --> 12:47.770
Don't we,evan?

13:13.000 --> 13:14.390
How's beth doing?

13:14.920 --> 13:16.290
Seems okay.

13:16.890 --> 13:17.820
You know her?

13:17.970 --> 13:18.830
She's a local.

13:18.860 --> 13:20.340
Her father'sa stable manager here.

13:20.360 --> 13:21.840
Yeah,you'd have thoughthe was a doctor.

13:21.850 --> 13:24.550
He was so in my face wheni
was giving beth a checkup.

13:25.020 --> 13:28.790
Dan's a bit overprotective
andnot the easiest man.

13:29.130 --> 13:32.160
Then again he hasn'thad
the easiest time either.

13:32.710 --> 13:33.820
Something happen?

13:34.210 --> 13:38.010
There were rumors abouta drug scandal
a few years ago,but he denied it.

13:38.100 --> 13:43.260
He used to trainall the locals and the wealthy
onesduring the summer,but now it's just beth.

13:43.300 --> 13:44.610
What type of drugs?

13:44.640 --> 13:46.150
I'm not sureabout the details.

13:46.170 --> 13:49.880
Just something aboutperformance
enhancing drugs was an issue.

13:51.390 --> 13:52.650
What's that?

13:52.940 --> 13:54.090
Air conditioningfor my car.

13:54.120 --> 13:57.140
Oh,to cover youfor the three seconds
it'll take to walkfrom here to there?

13:57.150 --> 13:59.150
Well,you knowi like to stay cool.

13:59.820 --> 14:01.270
Yeah,i do.

14:01.300 --> 14:03.540
Anyway,i have to get
backto the hospital.

14:03.580 --> 14:04.520
Thanks again for helng out.

14:04.540 --> 14:08.320
Hey,that's what friendswho sleep together
and then don't talkabout it are for.

14:08.390 --> 14:10.130
Right.

14:10.900 --> 14:13.590
It's awkward momentswith hank.

14:25.810 --> 14:27.610
What was that about?

14:28.110 --> 14:31.590
- I ask you about the weather andi
can't get you to shut up. - I'm  i'm--

14:31.610 --> 14:34.870
- and now when i need you to speak,you
stand there like a mute. - I know i--

14:34.880 --> 14:37.100
you were supposedto tow the party line.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.690
I know,i know,i know,okay?I'm sorry.

14:38.710 --> 14:42.220
It's just thisweb of deception that
you've wovenaround your entire family,

14:42.230 --> 14:45.000
it got in my head and i-- it's
justtoo much pressure,okay?

14:45.010 --> 14:46.500
- It's too much.
- Man up,evan.

14:46.520 --> 14:50.340
- You know me from business school.
- Okay,business.

14:50.350 --> 14:54.050
My parents thinki'm going to
wharton and getting my mba.

14:54.090 --> 14:59.130
And when i graduate,then i'll marry
raj,move to london,and work at his business.

14:59.150 --> 14:59.800
Got it?

14:59.820 --> 15:01.610
Raj,mba,wharton.

15:01.640 --> 15:03.470
Right.Totally doable.

15:04.440 --> 15:08.710
- So do we live on campusor do we co habitate?
- What?

15:08.720 --> 15:11.110
I'm just covering my
basesin case they ask,okay?

15:11.270 --> 15:13.230
Like,am ion the dean's list?

15:13.260 --> 15:15.670
And why wharton?Were
you,like,waitlisted at harvard?

15:15.730 --> 15:17.030
- I got into both.
- Both.

15:17.040 --> 15:19.260
I chose wharton.

15:19.280 --> 15:22.590
You live alone and
areon academic probation.

15:22.840 --> 15:25.500
- good one
- do you need flash cardsfor this?

15:25.530 --> 15:26.620
Uh,nope.

15:26.980 --> 15:28.410
Totally manned up.

15:28.560 --> 15:29.640
Let's do it.

15:32.890 --> 15:33.980
When do you compete again?

15:33.990 --> 15:35.310
Later this afternoon,daddy.

15:35.320 --> 15:35.930
Oh,good.

15:35.940 --> 15:37.490
Evan,do you ride as well?

15:37.510 --> 15:39.650
Me,no,no.I live alone.

15:40.020 --> 15:43.390
Anyone thirsty?Gosh,'cause i'm thirsty.

15:44.720 --> 15:47.010
We have a rider downin ring two.

15:47.030 --> 15:49.210
Rider down in ring two.

15:51.520 --> 15:53.060
Do not move her!

15:53.500 --> 15:54.450
Leave her.Do not move her.

15:54.470 --> 15:55.500
Beth,honey,you okay?

15:55.510 --> 15:56.470
Where is divya going?

15:56.480 --> 15:57.250
What is she doing?

15:57.260 --> 15:58.350
You know,i'm so hungry.

15:58.360 --> 16:00.450
Man,let's just grab some lunch,shall we?

16:02.320 --> 16:03.280
Beth,are you in pain?

16:03.310 --> 16:05.340
Just the painof humiliation.

16:05.360 --> 16:06.830
- Did you lose consciousness?
- No.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.540
All right,she just hadthe
wind knocked out of her.

16:08.550 --> 16:11.070
And you know this because?

16:11.100 --> 16:11.950
What are you doing?What are you doing?

16:11.970 --> 16:14.600
I'm followingspinal injury protocol.

16:14.610 --> 16:16.260
If we move her,it could be dangerous.

16:16.380 --> 16:18.520
Mid line cervicaltenderness.

16:18.840 --> 16:21.090
We need to get her boardedand
collared immediately.

16:21.130 --> 16:22.590
- I'll get a board.
- Beth,just stay still for me.

16:22.600 --> 16:24.240
Okay,we don't needa board.

16:25.240 --> 16:27.110
I'm not asking.

16:32.720 --> 16:35.080
Guys,i feel okay,really.

16:35.110 --> 16:37.460
All right,we've ruled out spinal injury.

16:37.680 --> 16:39.790
Now we just need to
clearyou for a concussion.

16:39.810 --> 16:41.390
My head doesn't hurt.

16:41.690 --> 16:42.990
You should sit outthe rest of the show.

16:43.010 --> 16:44.840
Okay,she saidthat her head doesn't hurt.

16:44.850 --> 16:46.880
What if beth is sore tomorrowand
doesn't feel like riding?

16:46.960 --> 16:48.950
She'd ride right nowif she could.

16:48.960 --> 16:49.590
I won't let her.

16:49.620 --> 16:52.430
We don't havea clear picture
of her neurological status.

16:52.620 --> 16:53.740
Let's get her up.

16:55.920 --> 16:58.260
Okay,why don't we ask
bethwhat she wants to do?

16:58.330 --> 17:00.300
I want to compete.I feel okay,really.

17:00.310 --> 17:05.130
I believe you beth,but symptoms of a concussion can
present themselvesat any point in the first 24 hours.

17:05.150 --> 17:06.780
So let's see how you
feelwhen you wake up tomorrow.

17:06.890 --> 17:07.940
Let's get her off the table.

17:07.960 --> 17:11.540
I still need to checkher blood pressure,her
reflexes,and i'll needa urine sample.

17:11.560 --> 17:13.190
Uh,what?

17:13.319 --> 17:17.500
uh,why exactly do you
needa urine sample?

17:17.530 --> 17:21.060
Well,for starters,i want to make
sure beth's kidneysweren't affected.

17:21.190 --> 17:23.450
If there's bloodin her urine,it
could indicaterenal damage.

17:23.460 --> 17:25.060
Okay,yeah.

17:25.270 --> 17:26.880
Have you ever worked oneof
these horse shows before?

17:26.890 --> 17:29.510
You don't really know
muchabout the sport,do you?

17:29.530 --> 17:32.000
Riders fall all the time.

17:32.020 --> 17:33.900
No,my specialtyisn't horseback riding.

17:34.030 --> 17:37.840
It's medicine andif you want beth
to compete,you need me to sign off.

17:37.860 --> 17:40.190
Yeah,you know what?I guess i
just don'tlike you very much.

17:40.200 --> 17:42.600
Dan,the feeling is mutual.

17:48.900 --> 17:51.400
I'm pretty sure that
bethdoesn't have kidney damage.

17:51.420 --> 17:52.970
And i'm pretty sure
you'rethinking the same thing.

17:52.980 --> 17:54.750
Yeah,well,pretty sure isn't good enough.

17:54.760 --> 17:56.080
You're checking her
urinefor drugs,aren't you?

17:56.090 --> 17:58.730
Send a sampleto hamptons
heritage for a tox screen and

17:58.740 --> 18:00.160
put a rush on it?

18:00.280 --> 18:02.620
I'm going back to the show.You
can go backto your parents.

18:02.690 --> 18:03.720
By the way,how's that going?

18:03.740 --> 18:07.710
Great.Being aroundbeth's dad makes
me feel like i never left them.

18:22.120 --> 18:23.650
Jilly bean.

18:24.110 --> 18:25.280
Don't call me that.

18:25.330 --> 18:27.440
I'm hurt.Not one picture of me?

18:27.980 --> 18:30.470
And please,don't just waltz in here.

18:30.490 --> 18:31.980
None of our weddingor our honeymoon.

18:31.990 --> 18:33.960
How do you stay remindedof
all those special moments?

18:33.970 --> 18:39.390
Can i remind youof a special moment
last year when i said,"i want a divorce"?

18:39.620 --> 18:42.870
Not even one fromthat little photo
booth down at the sip n' soda?

18:43.110 --> 18:44.460
Remember how hammered we were?

18:44.480 --> 18:45.450
No,charlie.

18:45.820 --> 18:47.860
The image has been
erased,like our marriage.

18:47.870 --> 18:50.450
Well,that tattoo you gotought to
be a pretty good reminder,right?

18:50.550 --> 18:51.490
What do you want?

18:51.550 --> 18:54.070
I want to know why you'reignoring my
texts,not returning my phone calls,

18:54.080 --> 18:57.310
not exuding joy when you find
me loiteringaround your office.

18:57.320 --> 18:58.510
'Cause i have nothingto say to you.

18:58.520 --> 19:00.210
Well,i'm sure you
couldthink of something.

19:00.220 --> 19:01.920
You're still my wife.

19:02.890 --> 19:08.890
That's only because i couldn'tserve you divorce
papers while you werein sudan or kenya or     botswana.

19:09.920 --> 19:11.680
That's all the more reason youshould
have come with me like i asked.

19:11.690 --> 19:15.370
Except i didn't wantto come with you
or did you forgetthat small detail too?

19:15.380 --> 19:17.350
Well,lucky for you,i'm back.

19:17.370 --> 19:20.430
Then i'll call my lawyerand i'll do
it quick before you disappear again.

19:20.440 --> 19:21.920
Take your time,jilly bean.

19:22.000 --> 19:22.900
I'm not going anywhere.

19:22.910 --> 19:24.170
Where havei heard that before?

19:25.000 --> 19:26.320
Yeah,i'm tiredof traveling.

19:26.550 --> 19:27.750
Tired of being awayfrom home.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.270
Tired of being awayfrom you.

19:29.290 --> 19:30.610
I'm tired of hearingabout it.

19:32.550 --> 19:37.690
You know,clearly you still havesome feelings
for me too or else you wouldn'tbe so hot...

19:39.450 --> 19:41.050
And bothered.

19:41.410 --> 19:42.590
Welcome back,charlie.

19:42.610 --> 19:43.690
Thanks.

19:44.800 --> 19:47.960
And whatever it is you planon
doing while you're here,

19:48.790 --> 19:53.500
keep it out of my office
and out of my life.

19:54.920 --> 19:56.460
Have a nice day.

20:01.970 --> 20:03.520
Hey,guys.How are you?Hey.

20:03.580 --> 20:04.970
Have you seen divya?

20:05.090 --> 20:06.980
Um,i was aboutto ask
you the same thing.No.

20:07.190 --> 20:09.050
So you two are close friends?

20:09.060 --> 20:11.580
Well,we goto wharton
together.I live off campus.

20:11.590 --> 20:14.190
And unfortunately,i'm
on academic probation.

20:14.420 --> 20:18.800
Which is really shockingbecause last semester i made the
dean's list,so it's kind of a weird contradiction there.

20:18.810 --> 20:20.040
Oh,my god!Here she is.

20:20.070 --> 20:21.200
Why did you run out there?

20:21.220 --> 20:24.360
I wanted to make surethat she
was okay.I know beth from my barn.

20:24.520 --> 20:26.100
We train together.

20:26.200 --> 20:27.900
So how about that drink?

20:27.910 --> 20:29.580
That's a good idea.

20:40.930 --> 20:42.390
Beautiful horse.

20:42.790 --> 20:44.140
Hank,meet slash.

20:44.150 --> 20:45.670
Slash,hank.

20:45.680 --> 20:47.140
Nice to meet you,slash.

20:47.160 --> 20:50.390
My dad rescued himand gave him to
me as a seventh birthday present.

20:50.410 --> 20:51.990
That's a pretty great gift.

20:52.180 --> 20:53.360
Sorry you'll have to
missthe rest of the day.

20:53.370 --> 20:54.190
No,it's no big deal.

20:54.360 --> 20:58.230
And anyway,my big eventis tomorrow,so
if i don't show signsof a concussion and

20:58.240 --> 21:02.440
you guys don't strap intoone of those  silence
of the lambs beds,i'll just haveto kick ass then.

21:02.550 --> 21:04.080
- Right.
- Can't win every time.

21:04.090 --> 21:05.950
I got third last yearafter i fell.

21:06.970 --> 21:08.060
This happened before?

21:08.450 --> 21:13.520
Slash decided he didn't feellike jumping the fence,so
he stopped shortand i went flying over it on his behalf.

21:13.540 --> 21:14.500
Were you injured?

21:14.640 --> 21:15.510
No.

21:16.300 --> 21:17.530
Mild concussion.

21:17.540 --> 21:19.600
But you got to getback on,right?

21:19.720 --> 21:22.110
Gosh,you really loveriding this much?

21:22.120 --> 21:24.320
My dad had me on a
horsebefore i could speak.

21:25.420 --> 21:29.040
He's not such a big talker,so i think
it worked out wellfor both of us.

21:32.430 --> 21:35.110
Um,i know you thinkmy dad's pushing me.

21:35.640 --> 21:37.890
And he is,but only
because heknows i love it.

21:38.550 --> 21:40.640
Most those girls out
there,it's a hobby for them.

21:40.660 --> 21:45.640
Something to do betweentrips to prague and other
activities to padtheir college applications.

21:45.660 --> 21:47.740
For me,it's my life.

21:48.230 --> 21:49.800
I want to competeat the olympics.

21:49.810 --> 21:50.960
I bet you will.

21:53.030 --> 21:58.090
And i'd love to see slashat the games also,just
to hear the announcer saythat name over and over.

21:58.180 --> 22:01.580
"And it's goldfor beth and slash.

22:11.840 --> 22:13.000
oh,how fitting.

22:13.030 --> 22:15.190
As if there weren't
enough waspshere already.

22:16.920 --> 22:18.060
How am i doing,by the way?

22:18.430 --> 22:19.050
Tremendous.

22:19.060 --> 22:19.980
I agree,you know?

22:19.990 --> 22:22.500
I loosened up and i'm
muchhappier with my performance.

22:22.720 --> 22:25.320
I am relievedthat you're feeling better.

22:26.700 --> 22:27.970
Your parents seemlike nice people.

22:27.990 --> 22:28.780
They are.

22:29.260 --> 22:31.210
They're still my parents.

22:32.560 --> 22:33.430
I've been stung!

22:33.450 --> 22:35.210
Darling,epinephrine.

22:35.350 --> 22:37.180
Your allergies.Here!

22:39.690 --> 22:41.070

22:42.300 --> 22:43.190
daddy?

22:43.210 --> 22:44.300
- Devesh?
- It didn't release.

22:44.310 --> 22:46.410
Devesh!Devesh!

22:46.850 --> 22:49.000
Okay,does anyonehave an epipen?

22:49.430 --> 22:52.570
Evan,quick.Tell hank we
need an epipen.Go fast!

22:54.760 --> 22:55.940
hold his head,mom.

22:56.470 --> 22:58.700
He can't breathe.We
need to clear his airway.

23:02.390 --> 23:03.910
Finding a space.

23:04.220 --> 23:06.280
Divya,what are you doing?

23:17.110 --> 23:18.530
Devesh katdare,56 years old

23:18.540 --> 23:19.240
stung by a wasp.

23:19.250 --> 23:22.290
After epi auto injectorfailure,with
angiodema and bronchospasmmounting,

23:22.300 --> 23:24.730
i performed a cricothyrotomyto
obtain a surgical airway.

23:24.750 --> 23:28.610
We administereddiphenhydramine 50
milligrams iv,cimetidine 300 milligrams iv,

23:28.620 --> 23:31.780
and 125 milligramsmethylpredasolone iv.

23:32.290 --> 23:33.820
Ms.Katdare,your husband is stable.

23:33.840 --> 23:35.350
His airway is open.

23:35.850 --> 23:37.210
How long
will his--

23:37.350 --> 23:39.030
the cric tubeis only temporary.

23:39.040 --> 23:41.640
It'll be removed within
24 hoursand he'll be fine.

23:41.740 --> 23:42.920
Thanks to divya.

23:43.340 --> 23:45.120
Mommy,go withthe emts,okay?

23:45.140 --> 23:46.580
I'll meet youat the hospital.

23:53.480 --> 23:54.690
divya?

23:55.170 --> 23:56.440
Divya,look at me.

23:57.740 --> 23:59.130
Your dad will be okay.

24:03.710 --> 24:06.210
he won't bewhen he finds out how
she knewwhat to do back there.

24:23.200 --> 24:24.730
house calls at midnight.

24:25.030 --> 24:29.550
You must be the best doctorin the world or you
really don't trust meto monitor my own daughter.

24:29.570 --> 24:31.000
Well,i'm concernedabout her.

24:31.010 --> 24:33.020
Okay,her visionisn't impaired.

24:33.060 --> 24:36.130
Her speech isn't slurred.She
isn't nauseous.She isn't dizzy.

24:36.150 --> 24:38.690
So,please,get the hell out of here.

24:38.720 --> 24:41.830
No matter where i go,beth can't
ride tomorrow without my consent.

24:41.840 --> 24:43.390
You don't like me.

24:44.050 --> 24:45.300
that is fine.

24:45.510 --> 24:48.690
Do not take it out on beth.

24:48.880 --> 24:50.190
Are you dopingyour daughter,dan?

24:50.200 --> 24:51.890
What are you talking about?

24:51.900 --> 24:53.470
Beth's tox screen.

24:53.980 --> 24:55.890
She has dextroamphetaminein her system.

24:55.900 --> 24:58.660
Well,that's not possible.Beth
isn't taking anymedication.

24:58.670 --> 25:00.900
It's typically prescribedfor adhd.

25:01.600 --> 25:04.000
It's considered aperformance
enhancing drug,dan.

25:04.010 --> 25:05.650
The lab made a mistake.

25:05.670 --> 25:06.710
Somebody did.

25:07.620 --> 25:08.500
Get out of here.

25:08.510 --> 25:10.220
I know aboutyour previous scandal.

25:10.240 --> 25:11.760
That was about horses.

25:11.770 --> 25:14.940
It wasn't about peopleand
it didn't involve drugs.

25:14.960 --> 25:16.500
It involved capsaicin.

25:17.120 --> 25:17.940
Chili pepper?

25:17.970 --> 25:22.600
I put it on the horse's legsas a pain
reliever until some expert decidedthat

25:22.610 --> 25:26.520
it made the horses jump the
fences higherand decided to ban it.

25:26.940 --> 25:29.960
I would never dopemy own daughter.

25:30.430 --> 25:34.180
Now get the helloff my property
before i help youoff of it.

25:34.190 --> 25:35.520
My dad didn't do anything.

25:36.730 --> 25:38.780
I  i did.I  i took the drugs.

25:38.920 --> 25:40.310
You what?

25:40.330 --> 25:43.390
Madison gave them to me.She
takes them for her adhd.

25:43.850 --> 25:46.080
I didn't take that manyand
i won't do it again.I swear.

25:46.090 --> 25:50.020
After all thatwe've been
through,how could you take that risk?

25:50.030 --> 25:53.180
I've just been really
tiredand spacey lately.

25:53.200 --> 25:56.610
I  i  i needed somethingto keep me
focused.I couldn't missthis competition.

25:56.620 --> 25:58.360
And now you will miss it.

25:58.890 --> 25:59.980
What?

26:00.600 --> 26:03.040
Because i don't carewhat anybody
says.You're not riding tomorrow.

26:03.050 --> 26:04.380
Dad,no.

26:04.630 --> 26:06.840
I have to compete.I've worked too hard.

26:07.380 --> 26:08.890
Tell him i'm okay,hank.

26:08.950 --> 26:10.050
Tell him!

26:10.700 --> 26:12.090
I'm sorry,beth,i can't.

26:18.390 --> 26:19.690
Night,doctor.

26:26.910 --> 26:28.640
So you didn'ttell your parents?

26:30.970 --> 26:32.160
Any shot theymay surprise you?

26:32.260 --> 26:34.700
Be,you know,proudof
what you've accomplished?

26:34.720 --> 26:36.370
I don't carewhat they think.

26:37.630 --> 26:38.810
Divya.

26:39.920 --> 26:41.140
I care...

26:41.950 --> 26:43.340
Too much...

26:44.060 --> 26:45.180
And i hate that.

26:45.210 --> 26:46.730
Of course you do.

26:46.880 --> 26:49.290
They're your parents.Of
course you wanttheir approval.

26:49.410 --> 26:51.540
Just like you wantyour
dad's approval,right?

26:52.490 --> 26:53.780
No,actually.

26:55.150 --> 26:56.550
I couldn't care less.

26:57.520 --> 26:58.190
Wait.

26:58.220 --> 27:00.960
You don't want your dadto
see how far you've come?

27:01.780 --> 27:03.330
Or how successful you are?

27:05.260 --> 27:10.210
When we were kids,my dad treated
evan and me likewe were his princes.

27:10.230 --> 27:11.680
We could do no wrong.

27:12.100 --> 27:15.470
And to us,i mean,we worshipped him.

27:17.720 --> 27:20.630
But then when our mom got
sickand we needed him most...

27:22.340 --> 27:25.810
He just walked out on
usand never looked back.

27:30.980 --> 27:32.880
I don't give a damnwhat he thinks.

27:39.890 --> 27:43.640
But you,you know,you have a
relationship with your parents.

27:43.690 --> 27:46.820
Built on a solid
foundationof love and lies.

27:46.850 --> 27:48.930
You think telling
themwill change everything.

27:49.580 --> 27:50.890
I know it will.

27:52.420 --> 27:55.790
But i just found you in a
bardrinking bourbon by yourself.

27:55.810 --> 27:59.850
It is entirely possiblethat you
have already hit rock bottom.

28:01.180 --> 28:03.500
i guess things can only
getbetter from here.

28:06.900 --> 28:08.380
I'm headed to the horse
show.Where are you?

28:08.510 --> 28:10.810
I'm just goingto the hospital.I'm
gonna check inon the dev.

28:10.830 --> 28:11.880
Uh,"the dev"?

28:11.890 --> 28:14.240
You know,the dev,husband to the rube.

28:14.700 --> 28:15.770
Rubina and devesh.

28:15.780 --> 28:17.240
It's divya's
parents,man.Just get with it.

28:17.250 --> 28:20.200
Okay,evan,i mean thisin
the kindest way possible.

28:20.220 --> 28:21.240
Stay out of it.

28:21.260 --> 28:23.970
Divya's dealingwith a lot right now
 and her fatherreally needs to rest.

28:23.980 --> 28:25.780
No,trust me.The dev loves me.

28:25.790 --> 28:27.430
And i'm bringingthe
guy samosas.It's cool.

28:27.580 --> 28:30.790
Okay, I'm gonna try this again.Stay out.

28:30.820 --> 28:31.520
What's that?

28:31.540 --> 28:33.350
Stay out of it.

28:33.750 --> 28:36.100
evan,i knowwhat you're
doing.I know that trick.

28:36.490 --> 28:37.870
Evan,they don't know.

28:53.970 --> 28:54.920
You need some help?

28:55.640 --> 28:59.120
You know,if you could help me stand
this beast up,i'd appreciate that.

28:59.130 --> 29:00.060
Yeah,sure.

29:00.090 --> 29:01.410
Thanks.

29:01.800 --> 29:03.210
Just  uh,yeah.There you go.

29:03.360 --> 29:04.420
Got it?

29:06.140 --> 29:07.350
- There you go.
- Thanks.

29:07.360 --> 29:07.980
What happened?

29:07.990 --> 29:12.210
Some lady was payingmore attention to
her manicurethan she was her driving.

29:12.650 --> 29:14.870
She didn't even notice.She
ran me right off the road.

29:15.420 --> 29:16.180
uh,charlie.

29:16.190 --> 29:17.000
Hank.

29:17.010 --> 29:21.120
You know,i'd shake your hand,but
it's coveredin barberry needles.

29:21.290 --> 29:22.880
I've never seenthose before.

29:23.570 --> 29:25.980
You're obviously not a
biker,golfer,or local.

29:25.990 --> 29:29.570
No,i'm not,but i am a doctor.Can i help?

29:31.790 --> 29:32.560
Sure.Why not?

29:32.570 --> 29:33.870
Okay,great.

29:34.350 --> 29:35.860
Let me see that.

29:36.580 --> 29:38.420
All right,um,i'll be right back.

29:38.440 --> 29:39.620
Thanks.

29:45.710 --> 29:47.260
That's a cool harley,by the way.

29:47.280 --> 29:49.390
Oh,thanks.I should sell it to you.

29:49.680 --> 29:51.570
The wife,she never liked it.

29:52.670 --> 29:54.870
So you studied medicineat
the home depot,right?

29:59.020 --> 30:00.480
Just give it a sec.

30:00.790 --> 30:02.350
All right,here we go.

30:09.940 --> 30:12.010
******

30:12.020 --> 30:12.860
****

30:12.870 --> 30:14.440
***

30:14.900 --> 30:16.700
Please,please,please stop.

30:16.800 --> 30:19.500
Good luck with the bikeand the wife.

30:20.080 --> 30:21.240
Thanks.

30:22.600 --> 30:28.090
So now that you know divya'sa physician
assistant,or p.A.As we call themin the biz,

30:28.100 --> 30:30.380
you probablyhave some questions.

30:31.200 --> 30:33.000
Divya'sa physician assistant?

30:33.010 --> 30:36.320
That's right.She's a physician
assistant for hank med.

30:36.330 --> 30:42.090
So maybe you guys havequestions
about hankmed or about me maybe?

30:42.290 --> 30:43.540
No?Okay.

30:44.330 --> 30:47.270
About a p.A.And what a p.A.Does?Yes?

30:47.320 --> 30:50.140
Okay,sit back,relax.Silence
your cell phones.

30:50.250 --> 30:51.660
Uh,that's a little joke.

30:52.990 --> 30:56.210
um,p.A.S basically just do exams.

30:56.220 --> 30:59.730
They treat illnesses.They
assist in surgeries.

30:59.760 --> 31:02.130
Or in your case,they
actually perform surgeries.

31:02.420 --> 31:06.000
Uh,so,wasn't that coolhow
she just "trached" you?

31:06.010 --> 31:07.530
Right there in frontof everybody.

31:07.540 --> 31:09.320
She just whacked that
thingright into your throat.

31:09.330 --> 31:11.550
Like,punched it in thereand
just saved your life.

31:11.570 --> 31:12.920
Liar.

31:13.490 --> 31:15.080
You're a liar.

31:15.510 --> 31:16.350
No.

31:16.390 --> 31:18.460
No,sir.I'm not a lawyer.

31:18.840 --> 31:20.700
I'm not evenan mba candidate.

31:20.720 --> 31:22.680
Although i'm sure you
probablyfigured that out already.

31:22.690 --> 31:24.390
He didn't call youa lawyer.

31:24.610 --> 31:25.990
He called you a liar.

31:26.330 --> 31:27.610
I'm a little confused.

31:27.620 --> 31:30.530
Divya did tell you she'sa
physician assistant?

31:34.820 --> 31:36.650
Uh,this was unforeseeable.

31:39.120 --> 31:43.000
So it was really nicemeeting
you and,uh,feel better,okay?

31:43.020 --> 31:46.980
Feel better.And
here,enjoy your samosas,or

31:59.530 --> 32:00.620
beth?

32:01.080 --> 32:02.940
Why are you dressedlike
you're going to ride?

32:02.950 --> 32:04.940
Because i am.All you
have to do is clear me.

32:04.950 --> 32:07.580
Your father doesn'twant you to
compete and i can't clear you.

32:07.590 --> 32:10.770
Listen,even withyesterday's fall,i'm
only two points awayfrom qualifying.

32:10.780 --> 32:11.980
Please,dr.Lawson.

32:11.990 --> 32:12.980
I wish i could,beth.

32:12.990 --> 32:14.180
You don't understand.

32:14.200 --> 32:16.190
This place used to
havea training school.

32:16.250 --> 32:19.470
My dad ran itand he was so happy.

32:19.600 --> 32:23.140
And then the rumors startedand the
parents stopped sending their kids.

32:23.310 --> 32:26.500
If i win first place,people
will wantto train with him again.

32:26.510 --> 32:30.190
Look,that'sa big burden for
you or anyone to take on.

32:30.560 --> 32:33.420
I am sure your dad will be
justas proud of you next year.

32:34.000 --> 32:37.290
Just pleasetake the helmet off.

32:45.050 --> 32:46.240
Are you okay there?

32:46.250 --> 32:48.670
I've probably snapped thishelmet
on and off,like,a billion times.

32:48.680 --> 32:49.810
Here.Let me.

32:53.660 --> 32:55.440
You've done enough.Thanks.

33:09.680 --> 33:12.870
I'm just really tiredand spacey lately.

33:14.930 --> 33:16.450
She's having seizures.

33:22.550 --> 33:29.350
Beth told us she was takingthe dextroamphetamine because she was
exhaustedand i think she was exhaustedfrom having the seizures.

33:29.460 --> 33:31.520
I've never seen herhave a seizure.

33:31.530 --> 33:32.830
Not one.I would know that.

33:32.840 --> 33:33.880
Not necessarily.

33:33.970 --> 33:35.820
There are many types
thatare impossible to detect.

33:35.830 --> 33:37.850
Beth may not evenbe
aware she's having them.

33:37.870 --> 33:38.820
How can that happen?

33:38.830 --> 33:42.470
There are simplepartial seizures.One
of the symptomsis jamais vu.

33:42.620 --> 33:43.530
Jamais vu?

33:43.540 --> 33:44.970
Yes,the oppositeof deja vu.

33:44.980 --> 33:49.140
You feel like you'reperforming a task for the first
timedespite the fact that you've done itcountless times before.

33:49.160 --> 33:50.760
You've seen this with beth?

33:50.770 --> 33:54.130
Yesterday when she wasfixing her saddle and
then i saw it again justa few minutes ago.

33:54.140 --> 33:58.730
Beth was tryingto take off her
helmet isn't that beth's horse?

33:59.590 --> 34:01.450
This way.This way.

34:06.450 --> 34:07.160
What's happening?

34:07.170 --> 34:08.380
She's having a seizure.

34:08.449 --> 34:11.100
A tonic clonic seizure.It's like
an electrical stormin her brain.

34:11.110 --> 34:12.380
Why?What happened?

34:12.389 --> 34:15.650
Fatigue,stress,adverse drug
reaction.Maybe her previous fall?

34:15.659 --> 34:17.040
Help her,please.

34:17.050 --> 34:18.400
Hold her gently,okay?

34:18.409 --> 34:20.310
We have to let the
seizurerun its course.

34:20.320 --> 34:21.650
Why is taking so long?

34:21.659 --> 34:23.960
Dan?Dan?She's gonna be okay.

34:23.969 --> 34:25.909
The convulsions shouldstop soon.

34:32.159 --> 34:33.510
Now when she comes to,she'll be tired.

34:33.610 --> 34:37.639
Maybe a bit disoriented also.She
should get that eegas soon as possible.

34:37.650 --> 34:38.280
Of course.

34:38.550 --> 34:40.330
Great.I'll call the hospital.

34:43.250 --> 34:44.310
Beth?

34:44.850 --> 34:46.250
You're okay.

34:49.330 --> 34:50.600
Thank god.

34:50.909 --> 34:52.239
How you doing,beth?

34:52.469 --> 34:53.780
Kind of woozy.

34:56.909 --> 34:58.600
The beam of light is gone.

34:58.700 --> 34:59.710
What beam of light?

34:59.720 --> 35:03.550
It's common for peoplewith this
condition to have visions,auras.

35:05.080 --> 35:06.780
Why didn't youtell me about this?

35:08.580 --> 35:10.760
I was afraid you'dkeep me from riding.

35:12.400 --> 35:13.800
I just want to ride.

35:14.020 --> 35:15.060
You will.

35:15.080 --> 35:17.400
The seizures can be
controlledby medication.

35:17.670 --> 35:19.660
You will leada completely normal life.

35:19.680 --> 35:20.780
You hear that?

35:21.270 --> 35:22.610
You're gonna be okay.

35:24.300 --> 35:26.100
And you can keep riding.

35:27.290 --> 35:29.190
That's great news,isn't that,baby?

35:32.230 --> 35:33.990
But you don't haveto keep riding.

35:35.480 --> 35:36.940
It's whatever you want.

35:47.490 --> 35:49.680
I'm sorry,okay?I'm really,really sorry.

35:49.700 --> 35:53.200
This is not how i wantedmy
parents to find out.

35:55.530 --> 35:56.950
How did they react?

35:57.180 --> 36:01.830
Uh,well,your dad looked likehe was
getting stabbed in the throat again

36:01.840 --> 36:04.620
and your mom took it
almost as well as that.

36:05.240 --> 36:07.860
Great.Great!

36:08.350 --> 36:09.660
They'll never accept this.

36:09.670 --> 36:11.080
Well,they have to.

36:11.110 --> 36:12.730
You're too good at itfor them not to.

36:12.740 --> 36:16.770
Divya,if it weren't for you,hankmed
wouldn't be the meteoricstartup that it is.

36:16.780 --> 36:18.130
You just don't get it,evan.

36:23.900 --> 36:28.460
You launcheda successful company in one of the
most exclusivemarkets in the world,all right?

36:28.700 --> 36:31.120
I'm proud of you and i
don'teven like you that much.

36:31.210 --> 36:32.920
So you're right.I don't get it.

36:32.930 --> 36:34.250
Explain it to me.

36:37.510 --> 36:38.910
When i was ten...

36:40.030 --> 36:44.500
Nigel threw a plastic
shovelat my best friend holly.

36:44.610 --> 36:46.230
It cut her rightabove her eye.

36:46.850 --> 36:48.270
I grabbed the first aid kit.

36:48.310 --> 36:49.710
I cleaned the wound.

36:49.730 --> 36:53.890
I applied antibiotic
creamand put a band aid on it.

36:55.090 --> 36:59.200
Then i grabbed the shovel,hit nigel with
it,and started the processall over again.

36:59.760 --> 37:01.820
That's what i call full service.

37:01.900 --> 37:03.310
It was a great day.

37:03.600 --> 37:06.480
It was the day that i knewi
wanted to practice medicine.

37:09.960 --> 37:15.540
When i told my parents thati wanted to attend
med school,they told me what they wanted.

37:16.550 --> 37:20.750
A daughter withan mba from wharton
who would become vpof development

37:20.760 --> 37:24.790
and acquisitions at
katdareproperties international.

37:25.470 --> 37:27.470
Evan,i hate acquisitions.

37:28.040 --> 37:29.580
And i hate development.

37:29.610 --> 37:31.730
And i hate real estate.

37:32.310 --> 37:35.660
But most of all,i hate that they
never took my dreamsinto consideration.

37:37.410 --> 37:43.820
So why don't you walkin there right now
and tell them everythingyou just told me?

37:45.680 --> 37:47.300
And now you know everything.

37:47.590 --> 37:51.000
I have wanted to tell youboth for
ages and i'm sorry that i didn't.

37:51.640 --> 37:53.690
I've hated lying to you.

37:54.880 --> 37:56.410
I hope that you'll forgive me.

38:01.090 --> 38:02.750
You saved my life.

38:02.830 --> 38:05.510
You took responsibilityfor
your deception.

38:06.030 --> 38:08.020
It is behind us.

38:11.590 --> 38:13.580
besides,it's almost over.

38:14.300 --> 38:15.250
What are you talking about?

38:15.270 --> 38:17.490
Soon you won't even bein the hamptons.

38:18.730 --> 38:20.410
Of course.Yes.

38:22.220 --> 38:26.170
Because i will be movingto
london and engaged to raj.

38:26.190 --> 38:27.300
Exactly.

38:27.460 --> 38:29.760
That was your planall along,yes?

38:29.770 --> 38:33.090
Yes.Of course.

38:43.910 --> 38:45.800
Have funat your first horse show?

38:46.190 --> 38:47.730
No,not so much.No,you?

38:47.950 --> 38:49.460
Not so much.

38:50.160 --> 38:51.200
I heard you saved a girl.

38:51.210 --> 38:53.170
I heard you saved a girl.

38:53.990 --> 38:55.400
I'll tell you what,henry.

38:55.540 --> 38:59.470
Bringing families
together,it's exhausting work.

38:59.540 --> 39:01.010
couldn't agree more.

39:02.610 --> 39:06.440
Divya and her parents,that
is onecomplicated family,man.

39:06.460 --> 39:07.950
They are all over her.

39:07.960 --> 39:09.150
I had this patient.

39:09.160 --> 39:11.740
This 15 year old girl.Great girl...

39:12.730 --> 39:15.960
With this dad hovering.

39:16.430 --> 39:18.690
I wanted to just  hmm.

39:18.930 --> 39:20.380
He drove me crazy.

39:21.870 --> 39:23.150
And it got me thinking.

39:24.090 --> 39:26.660
About how when dad usedto hit
us ground balls over and over?

39:26.680 --> 39:28.910
Like,even after it got
darkout,he'd just keep going.

39:28.920 --> 39:34.750
About the fact that asdifficult as this man was,the
last thing he would ever dois walk out on his child.

39:35.850 --> 39:37.000
I mean,this girl was a mess,you know?

39:37.010 --> 39:40.960
She was over stressed,over
pressured,taking pills to compensate.

39:43.080 --> 39:45.610
And yet,i found myself
totallyjealous of her.

39:46.810 --> 39:49.340
You think when we have
kids,we're gonna mess them up?

39:50.790 --> 39:52.430
You ever think about that?

39:56.630 --> 39:59.920
oh,sorry.I was just thinking
aboutwhat kids of yours would be like.

40:00.110 --> 40:04.310
Oh,what?Just smart and
intelligentand just overall awesome

40:04.350 --> 40:05.510
so they'll take afteryour wife.

40:05.520 --> 40:08.490
Wait,so you actuallyenvision
me with a woman like that,huh?

40:09.520 --> 40:15.200

terracein the hamptons sipping a mint julep.

40:16.260 --> 40:18.850
Well,crazier thingshave happened.

40:19.780 --> 40:21.720
Yes,they have,my brother.

40:45.260 --> 40:46.690

40:48.380 --> 40:49.130

40:49.140 --> 40:52.800

40:53.100 --> 40:55.020

40:55.620 --> 40:56.480
You don't have to do that.

40:56.490 --> 40:58.760
I know i don'thave to do that.I want to.

40:58.770 --> 41:00.040
Until you findsomeone full time.

41:00.050 --> 41:01.450
Who knows?Could be fun.

41:01.460 --> 41:06.270
You and me working under the same
roof,gossipingby the water cooler.

41:06.330 --> 41:09.240
Yeah,or beinggossiped about.

41:09.660 --> 41:11.080
It could be dangerous.

41:13.540 --> 41:14.400
Stop looking at me like that.

41:14.410 --> 41:15.860
Stop looking at me like that.

41:15.870 --> 41:18.010
This is my office.

41:18.030 --> 41:21.190
And i'm not that kindof girl...

41:21.560 --> 41:22.440

41:22.460 --> 41:25.200
Thought nevercrossed my mind.

41:30.140 --> 41:32.280

41:33.620 --> 41:36.320
