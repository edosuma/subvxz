00:17.620 --> 00:19.050
Don't slouch.

00:21.860 --> 00:24.370
Could you please not be such a girl?

00:28.460 --> 00:30.130
Wasp! Big wasp!

You monster!

01:57.300 --> 01:59.050
lt was an accident!

01:59.140 --> 02:02.760
Easy for you to say
when you whacked the only witness.

02:02.860 --> 02:05.130
This was cold-blooded bearicide.

02:06.100 --> 02:08.560
Come on, Miles.
He's just a stuffed animal.

02:09.500 --> 02:12.890
l'd cover his ears, but they're gone.

02:15.020 --> 02:18.130
All right. Fine. l will buy you a new one.

02:19.260 --> 02:25.210
How? This is not just a stuffed animal,
it's a part of my childhood.

02:25.300 --> 02:28.330
The move from the crib
to the big girl's bed,

02:28.420 --> 02:31.730
the measles, the mumps,
the potty-training,

02:31.820 --> 02:33.330
he was there through it all.

02:33.420 --> 02:38.050
We were all there for the potty-training.
''Look what l did, look what l did!''

02:38.980 --> 02:41.490
That was an important moment for me.

02:42.940 --> 02:44.850
Stupid directions.

02:44.940 --> 02:48.130
lt's just a bookshelf,
not the dang space shuttle.

02:49.140 --> 02:53.570
You kids know anybody
who speaks Portuguese, Dutch or...

02:53.660 --> 02:55.730
ls this Hebrew or Chinese?

02:56.300 --> 02:58.730
Daddy!
Look what Jackson did to Beary.

02:58.820 --> 03:00.690
lt was an accident. There was a wasp.

03:00.780 --> 03:02.170
-Where?
-See?

03:04.660 --> 03:05.850
Daddy!

03:06.820 --> 03:08.850
l'm sorry, honey,
but you know l'm allergic.

03:08.940 --> 03:12.770
And those little buggers are just drawn
to my Brazil nut conditioner.

03:13.780 --> 03:16.050
Dad, can you forget about your hair
for, like, 1 0 seconds

03:16.140 --> 03:17.970
and help me here?

03:18.060 --> 03:21.680
Oh, no. l don't know
if this is your stomach or your butt.

03:23.180 --> 03:26.450
Hey, l'm sorry, darling,
but you're in high school now.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.250
Don't you think you're a little too old

03:31.460 --> 03:35.850
to be waiting this long for your brother
to apologise? Do it, boy!

03:38.380 --> 03:40.760
Miles, l'm sorry about your bear.

03:43.220 --> 03:45.930
May he rest in pieces.

03:48.140 --> 03:49.930
Come on, he's a toy!

03:50.020 --> 03:51.930
He was also my friend.

03:52.020 --> 03:54.930
And he will be avenged!
Avenged, l tell you.

04:00.140 --> 04:03.890
Get ready for the only thing
worse than Jackson, his room.

04:06.380 --> 04:09.210
-Are you sure this is safe?
-Absolutely!

04:10.980 --> 04:12.850
lf you're a sewer rat.

04:15.660 --> 04:17.010
What are you doing?

04:17.100 --> 04:20.250
l want to say goodbye to my mom,
just in case.

04:22.140 --> 04:23.360
Suck it up!

04:23.460 --> 04:25.810
We gotta find something
Jackson really loves.

04:25.900 --> 04:28.850
Anything worth loving
would die in here.

04:36.940 --> 04:38.610
That is not funny.

04:43.300 --> 04:45.170
Hey. What about this?

04:45.260 --> 04:47.890
Oh, no. lt's not good enough.

04:47.980 --> 04:52.570
When Jackson sees that it's gone,
it has to hit him right in the gut.

04:52.660 --> 04:55.010
Like when l lost Beary Bear.

04:55.100 --> 04:57.050
Let it out. Let it out.

04:57.460 --> 05:01.730
lt's not that. There's a stench over here
that's making my eyes water.

05:07.380 --> 05:09.680
Who puts raisins on pizza?

05:09.780 --> 05:11.730
And why are they moving?

05:12.820 --> 05:14.410
Get it!

05:15.860 --> 05:18.610
Miley, we gotta hurry.
Jackson could walk in anytime.

05:18.700 --> 05:21.850
lt's all right.
l got Oliver on Jackson duty.

05:22.660 --> 05:24.730
Speaking of Jackson doodie...

05:25.580 --> 05:28.610
Oh, no, it's okay.
lt's just chocolate pudding.

05:32.940 --> 05:35.530
-Favourite fruit?
-An apple.

05:36.180 --> 05:38.640
-Second favourite fruit?
-A pear.

05:38.740 --> 05:42.050
Third favourite fruit, and remember,
you've already used apple and pear.

05:42.140 --> 05:44.490
This is the dumbest survey
l've ever heard. l'm going home.

05:44.580 --> 05:47.570
No, you can't.
This is for half of my grade.

05:47.660 --> 05:48.690
ln what class?

05:48.780 --> 05:51.850
Sociologicology.

05:53.340 --> 05:54.370
Favourite word?

05:54.460 --> 05:56.690
Wait a minute. l know this one.
Goodbye!

05:56.780 --> 06:00.480
No. l still have to test your reflex skills.
Catch me.

06:00.580 --> 06:03.890
Dude, l'm trying to get away from you.
Why would l want to catch you?

06:03.980 --> 06:07.130
Because... Because l just did this.

06:10.660 --> 06:12.850
Those are excellent reflexes!

06:21.620 --> 06:24.130
What's Rico doing in Jackson's room?

06:25.300 --> 06:29.690
Something Jackson loves.
Something Jackson loves.

06:34.580 --> 06:36.810
Never gonna happen, my friend.

06:41.460 --> 06:43.730
-Hey. What about this?
-Careful!

06:44.460 --> 06:48.850
That is Jackson's autographed
Joey vitolo baseball.

06:48.940 --> 06:51.730
lf anything happened to that,
he'd freak.

06:55.700 --> 06:56.840
Hello.

07:00.100 --> 07:01.850
Yeah? What?

07:02.420 --> 07:04.130
Oliver says
Jackson's on his way home.

07:04.220 --> 07:05.440
How much time do we have?

07:05.860 --> 07:07.890
Stupid, weird kid.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.490
Not much.

07:13.060 --> 07:15.520
-You do not want to go in there!
-We've got no choice.

07:15.620 --> 07:16.650
No!

07:19.820 --> 07:21.770
Towel, towel...

07:29.620 --> 07:32.130
lt's a good thing l straightened up.

07:43.580 --> 07:46.140
l cannot wait to see the look
on Jackson's face

07:46.220 --> 07:50.250
when he sees the shredded remains
of his stupid little ball.

07:50.340 --> 07:56.520
''My ball. My precious
little autographed baseball.''

07:57.260 --> 08:00.290
-Still dizzy from Jackson fumes?
-A little bit.

08:01.180 --> 08:02.400
Hey, what's your dad doing out there?

08:02.500 --> 08:04.250
l don't know.
Building a bookshelf or something.

08:04.340 --> 08:07.210
That is so cool
he knows how to do stuff like that.

08:08.340 --> 08:11.690
Dang niblets! Sweet flabbit!

08:11.780 --> 08:15.850
A ''glungshtacken'' does not fit
into a ''flogenhagen''!

08:17.060 --> 08:18.490
Hello, ladies.

08:18.580 --> 08:20.330
-Hi, Dad.
-Hey, Mr Stewart.

08:21.460 --> 08:22.810
Having fun?

08:23.460 --> 08:29.010
You betcha! Just doing what men do.
You know, building stuff and loving it.

08:31.540 --> 08:34.650
Have you, by any chance,
seen the first aid kit?

08:35.860 --> 08:37.850
-Upstairs closet.
-Thanks.

08:44.980 --> 08:50.450
Okay, vitolo.
You are about to go from a great player

08:50.540 --> 08:52.530
to a grated player.

08:53.820 --> 08:55.170
Miley, are you sure you wanna do this?

08:55.260 --> 08:57.640
l mean, the whole Beary Bear thing
was an accident.

08:57.740 --> 09:01.490
You're right.
l'll make it ''look'' like an accident.

09:03.820 --> 09:06.930
l am in the mood
for some grated cheese.

09:08.620 --> 09:12.610
And here's something that looks
like a fancy gourmet cheese ball.

09:19.260 --> 09:23.040
Come on, do it!
Do it, you manicured little wimp.

09:23.140 --> 09:27.130
Come on! What's the matter with me?
Why can't l do it?

09:27.220 --> 09:29.330
Face it,
you're just not that kind of person.

09:29.420 --> 09:31.800
You're right.
Why do l always have to be so good?

09:31.900 --> 09:35.010
l can't even look at this any more.
You take it.

09:50.580 --> 09:52.010
No!

09:57.780 --> 10:01.050
-Now that's what l call an accident.
-You're right.

10:01.780 --> 10:04.610
lt is almost like it was meant to be.

10:04.700 --> 10:08.450
l have a destroyed bear,
and now he's got a destroyed ball.

10:08.540 --> 10:11.210
Once again, the universe is in balance.

10:11.780 --> 10:14.490
-Hey, Miles. l got your bear fixed.
-What?

10:14.580 --> 10:16.850
Yeah, well, l was thinking,
if you wrecked something of mine,

10:16.940 --> 10:19.320
even by accident,
l'd be pretty mad, too.

10:19.420 --> 10:23.410
So, there you go.
Hope this lets me off the hook.

10:24.300 --> 10:27.450
-You are most definitely off the hook.
-Cool.

10:31.300 --> 10:33.810
And l am so on it.

10:42.740 --> 10:46.730
And l didn't think l could do it.
And l was so right.

10:49.260 --> 10:52.570
Okay, look. lt may not be perfect,

10:52.660 --> 10:55.370
but, you know, in a certain kind of light,

10:55.460 --> 11:00.650
if you tilt your head
and close your right eye,

11:00.740 --> 11:03.450
then close your left eye...

11:03.540 --> 11:04.890
Yeah, that works!

11:04.980 --> 11:08.650
You guys, what's the big deal?
lt's just a signed baseball.

11:08.740 --> 11:10.690
Go to a collectors shop
and get a new one.

11:10.780 --> 11:14.290
What is it,
a Babe Ruth or a Willie Mays?

11:14.380 --> 11:17.130
No.
lt's just some guy named Joey vitolo.

11:19.220 --> 11:23.610
This was a Joey vitolo?
What kind of an animal are you?

11:24.220 --> 11:26.450
l'm not liking where this is going.

11:26.540 --> 11:31.170
He's the only guy in history to hit
five home runs at his first five at-bats.

11:31.260 --> 11:32.570
Then how come l never heard of him?

11:32.660 --> 11:35.530
Because on his last home run,
he did a cartwheel to celebrate,

11:35.620 --> 11:37.920
tore up his shoulder
and never played again.

11:38.020 --> 11:41.010
Now he owns some pasta place
in Pasadena.

11:41.100 --> 11:44.330
A pasta place in Pasadena,
that's perfect.

11:44.420 --> 11:46.850
lf you're thinking about
getting his autograph, good luck.

11:46.940 --> 11:50.450
Since the cartwheel ended his career,
he won't sign anything.

11:50.540 --> 11:54.490
Last year, l tried to get his autograph
on a napkin...

11:54.580 --> 11:56.570
He blew his nose into it.

11:57.980 --> 11:59.250
ls that the thing
you have framed in your room?

11:59.340 --> 12:01.970
And someday, it'll be worth a fortune.

12:03.780 --> 12:06.410
No offence, Oliver, but you're a guy.

12:06.500 --> 12:10.570
Trust me, when a sweet innocent girl
like me asks,

12:10.660 --> 12:12.850
he has got to say yes.

12:13.980 --> 12:15.010
No.

12:17.180 --> 12:20.210
But my brother's ball is ruined.

12:21.580 --> 12:23.490
Well, in that case, no.

12:25.100 --> 12:27.770
Now, you're gonna order
some ravioli or beat it.

12:27.860 --> 12:29.080
-But she was just...
-Bye.

12:29.180 --> 12:30.370
-But you don't...
-Bye-bye.

12:30.460 --> 12:32.650
-All l need...
-Bye, bye, bye.

12:34.260 --> 12:37.290
Come on, Joey.
Don't you care about your fans?

12:37.380 --> 12:38.770
Once again, no.

12:38.860 --> 12:41.130
l gave them the best
eight-and-a-third innings of my life,

12:41.220 --> 12:43.210
and you know what l get?

12:43.300 --> 12:47.250
-l'm the punch line on cable sports.
-lt's true.

12:47.340 --> 12:50.810
When a player does a face plant,
they call it a vitolo.

12:51.740 --> 12:53.210
lt's terrible.

12:54.860 --> 12:56.690
You know what?
As far as l'm concerned,

12:56.780 --> 12:58.000
that part of my life is over, all right?

12:58.100 --> 13:01.090
The only things l really care about
is linguini, lasagna...

13:01.180 --> 13:04.090
-Daddy.
-And my little girl. Hello, sweetheart.

13:04.180 --> 13:06.810
-Hi, sweetie. What's your name?
-Angela.

13:06.900 --> 13:10.290
Angela! What a beautiful name.

13:10.380 --> 13:13.210
How about you get your daddy
to sign this ball?

13:13.300 --> 13:16.130
How about you order
some ravioli or beat it?

13:16.220 --> 13:18.010
That's my girl!

13:18.100 --> 13:20.050
Yeah, adorable.

13:23.140 --> 13:25.130
Hey, Miley, check out the shirt.

13:26.060 --> 13:28.250
Yeah, l think we have
a little Hannah Montana fan here.

13:28.340 --> 13:30.250
She rules.

13:30.340 --> 13:33.490
-Really?
-Totally. Okay, ready?

13:33.580 --> 13:35.880
<i>She's got the limo out fron</i> t

13:37.420 --> 13:41.200
<i>Hottest styles, every sho</i> e
<i>every colou</i> r

13:41.300 --> 13:42.330
<i>Yeah, when she..</i>.

13:42.420 --> 13:43.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we get it.

13:43.580 --> 13:47.010
Hey, you don't have to
listen to it 50 times a day.

13:47.740 --> 13:49.570
-Wanna bet?
-Wanna bet?

13:50.780 --> 13:52.570
Hey, sweetie,

13:52.660 --> 13:56.410
if l could bring Hannah Montana
down here to meet you,

13:56.500 --> 13:58.410
could you get your daddy
to sign this baseball?

13:58.500 --> 14:01.810
-You know Hannah Montana?
-Losing feeling, losing feeling.

14:01.900 --> 14:03.010
Nice try, kid.

14:03.100 --> 14:05.730
But l don't care who you bring in here,
because l'm not signing anything.

14:05.820 --> 14:07.690
Losing feeling, losing feeling.

14:07.780 --> 14:09.130
He'll sign.

14:17.900 --> 14:19.930
Oh, hey, Dad.
How's that bookshelf going?

14:20.020 --> 14:21.970
lt's really cooking now.

14:25.940 --> 14:28.320
-Want a weenie?
-l'll pass.

14:28.780 --> 14:31.370
You sure? lt's flogenhagen-flavoured.

14:45.700 --> 14:47.170
A little used.

14:52.180 --> 14:53.650
A lot of used.

14:55.820 --> 14:57.530
There's my pudding.

15:04.020 --> 15:07.490
My ball. My Joey vitolo!

15:08.620 --> 15:09.760
Miley.

15:10.420 --> 15:14.290
l will be avenged.
Yes! l will be avenged.

15:17.460 --> 15:19.840
l don't remember raisins in that.

15:21.820 --> 15:23.170
Not again.

15:29.020 --> 15:30.770
And there you go.

15:30.860 --> 15:34.480
Okay, l've signed every visible part
of your daughter's body.

15:34.580 --> 15:37.730
Now, will you please
just sign my friend's ball?

15:37.820 --> 15:41.210
Sure. No problem.
Right after the show.

15:42.100 --> 15:43.570
What show, Joe?

15:43.660 --> 15:45.570
Hit it, Paulie.

15:46.180 --> 15:47.370
No way.

15:51.060 --> 15:53.810
This was not part of our deal.

15:54.780 --> 15:58.010
You do a few numbers, you tell them
to try the veal and you're out of here.

15:58.100 --> 15:59.450
This isn't fair.

15:59.540 --> 16:02.650
You promised my friend
you would sign their ball

16:02.740 --> 16:04.570
if l met your daughter!

16:04.660 --> 16:07.690
When you're right, you're right.
Not a problem.

16:10.940 --> 16:13.240
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

16:13.340 --> 16:14.650
This just says ''Joey.''

16:14.740 --> 16:15.960
lf you want the ''vitolo'' part,

16:16.060 --> 16:18.250
you're gonna have
to get your old blue jeans up there

16:18.340 --> 16:20.210
and make some noise.

16:20.300 --> 16:21.890
''Old blue jeans,'' ''make some noise.''
You get it?

16:21.980 --> 16:23.370
Fine.

16:23.460 --> 16:26.650
But you are setting a terrible example
for your daughter.

16:26.740 --> 16:28.530
l can live with that.

16:32.500 --> 16:36.450
-Why are there two microphones?
-lt's funny you should ask that.

16:38.620 --> 16:39.650
There.

16:40.380 --> 16:42.760
Don't upstage me, kid.
lt's my restaurant.

16:42.860 --> 16:45.690
Fine. But l ain't pushing the veal.

16:45.780 --> 16:48.010
l thought you were gonna say that.

16:48.100 --> 16:50.810
Oh, yeah! Try the veal!

17:01.180 --> 17:05.089
You will tell me what l want to know.

17:06.060 --> 17:11.730
The choice is whether you will tell me
before the pain or after!

17:12.740 --> 17:14.650
Now, where is the ball?

17:15.339 --> 17:16.930
What ball?

17:18.980 --> 17:24.130
The Joey vitolo my dad gave me
for my 1 3th birthday! That ball.

17:25.180 --> 17:28.210
-l don't know what you're talking about.
-Fine.

17:29.060 --> 17:32.760
Perhaps a trip to the closet
will jog your memory.

17:34.100 --> 17:36.330
You'll never get me to squeal.

17:37.220 --> 17:40.170
You're right. You are strong.
But he is weak!

17:41.700 --> 17:43.490
Oliver, don't let him break you!

17:43.580 --> 17:46.530
lt's okay. lt's just a closet. What is that?

17:48.420 --> 17:51.610
No, no, no. Help me.

17:55.300 --> 17:58.130
She's at vitolo's.

18:00.900 --> 18:03.730
<i>Tai chi practice</i> s
<i>Snowboard champio</i> n

18:03.820 --> 18:08.090

<i>l might even be a rock sta</i> r

18:08.180 --> 18:09.490
<i>Thank you</i>!

18:12.820 --> 18:16.410
<i>And now, a special Vitolo treat</i>,

18:17.220 --> 18:20.050

18:20.140 --> 18:25.160

18:27.660 --> 18:29.530

19:19.300 --> 19:20.770
-What?
-Yeah. Just follow my lead, all right?

19:20.860 --> 19:23.370
lt's good. lt's good stuff. Come on.

19:30.500 --> 19:31.720
Come on.

19:49.380 --> 19:51.450
Hannah, what are you doing?

19:53.500 --> 19:57.490
What does it look like l'm doing?
l'm trying your daddy's veal.

19:57.580 --> 19:59.880
Hey, what are you doing?
You're embarrassing me.

19:59.980 --> 20:02.650
You better pull yourself together
for the second show.

20:02.740 --> 20:04.730
Washed-up ballplayer say what?

20:04.820 --> 20:07.770
l got an agent and
a record producer coming, all right?

20:07.860 --> 20:10.370
You want that ball, you better
make me look good, all right?

20:10.460 --> 20:13.770
A Justin Timberlake mask
couldn't make you look good.

20:13.860 --> 20:15.490
-Do you know who l am?
-Yeah.

20:15.580 --> 20:17.690
You're the guy l used to look up to.

20:17.780 --> 20:20.690
Now you're just some jerk
who's taking advantage of my friend.

20:20.780 --> 20:22.410
Come on, let's go.

20:22.500 --> 20:25.250
But l ruined your ball.

20:25.340 --> 20:27.770
l know. And l know it was an accident.

20:27.860 --> 20:30.730
And it's okay,
l'm letting you off the hook.

20:35.740 --> 20:37.850
Jackson, hold on. Wait.

20:37.940 --> 20:39.530
l don't understand.

20:39.620 --> 20:43.320
l didn't let you off the hook.
l wanted you to suffer.

20:43.420 --> 20:47.250
l saw that last number.
l think we've both suffered enough.

20:47.340 --> 20:50.170
-So you don't want your ball any more?
-Nah.

20:50.260 --> 20:52.330
No autograph is worth this.

20:53.020 --> 20:54.210
Thanks.

20:55.300 --> 20:57.490
Hold on! l forgot something.

20:57.580 --> 20:58.640
Hey!

20:59.660 --> 21:00.850
-Hey, Joey.
-Yeah.

21:00.940 --> 21:03.010
-Ready for the big finale?
-What finale?

21:03.100 --> 21:04.240
Yours.

21:04.860 --> 21:06.570
One meatball to go!

21:12.700 --> 21:14.530
Right in the cannolis.

21:18.060 --> 21:21.130
You know, it was awful nice of you
to forgive Mr vitolo.

21:21.220 --> 21:25.970
Well, after he finally signed
the baseball and he apologised,

21:26.060 --> 21:29.410
l figured it was time for me
to let him off the hook.

21:31.820 --> 21:35.730
Now, if you'll excuse me.
l promised Joey one last song.

21:36.300 --> 21:37.810
Hit it, Paulie!

22:01.540 --> 22:05.370
That's weird.
Joey's signature is different this time.

22:05.460 --> 22:07.570
On the ball you gave me,
the ''Y'' was all curly, you know,

22:07.660 --> 22:10.490
kind of like the way you do yours.

22:10.580 --> 22:12.090
Hey.

22:12.180 --> 22:15.800
You know if l could dance like that,
l'd give myself a 1 0.
