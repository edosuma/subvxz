00:00.767 --> 00:04.169
Okay, Max, here are the paint
chips for our new dessert bar.

00:04.171 --> 00:06.271
Don't eat them.
This isn't your childhood.

00:06.273 --> 00:07.573
These are all pink.

00:07.575 --> 00:09.708
You want the walls
of our bar to be all pink?

00:09.710 --> 00:11.343
It'll be the first time
someone drinks

00:11.345 --> 00:14.680
after they enter a vagina.

00:14.682 --> 00:18.283
Oh, hey--
no vagina in the dina.

00:18.285 --> 00:22.521
Or your apartment.
Ever.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.123
You know,
this isn't Hooters.

00:24.125 --> 00:28.093
The v-bomb isn't usually batted
around the workplace.

00:28.095 --> 00:29.995
Speaking of batting
things around,

00:29.997 --> 00:33.632
our cat wants you
to come over again.

00:33.634 --> 00:34.867
Yesterday you said your cat

00:34.869 --> 00:39.038
was too cool to
hang out with me.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.439
So which is it?

00:40.441 --> 00:42.007
'Cause I am free tonight.

00:43.443 --> 00:45.744

00:47.481 --> 00:53.685
♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

00:53.687 --> 00:56.889
Hey, everybody!

01:00.827 --> 01:02.661
You know what today is?

01:02.663 --> 01:03.996
I hope it ain't the 15th,

01:03.998 --> 01:07.266
'cause that means
I missed dialysis.

01:07.268 --> 01:09.935
No, I'm 20 weeks preggers.

01:09.937 --> 01:13.539
And it's time for Oleg and I
to choose the godparents.

01:13.541 --> 01:15.874
You know, it's
an old Polish tradition.

01:15.876 --> 01:19.078
Like pierogies
and public hangings.

01:20.213 --> 01:21.580
Godparents?

01:21.582 --> 01:23.982
God didn't even give me
parents-parents.

01:23.984 --> 01:26.518
He just gave me some lady that
took me home from the hospital

01:26.520 --> 01:29.221
in a Blockbuster Video bag.

01:29.223 --> 01:30.456
It's a big decision.

01:30.458 --> 01:32.724
You have to pick a couple who
would raise the child

01:32.726 --> 01:34.493
with your beliefs
and values.

01:34.495 --> 01:36.462
And Hugh Hefner
and whoever he's banging

01:36.464 --> 01:38.897
already said no.

01:38.899 --> 01:41.200
Yeah, so I'm making a list.

01:41.202 --> 01:43.535
But Oleg doesn't
want anyone in prison.

01:43.537 --> 01:48.407
You know, so that knocks out
most of the women in my family.

01:48.409 --> 01:50.342
You know, you guys
could also have

01:50.344 --> 01:52.444
these conversations at home.

01:52.446 --> 01:55.848
But this counter is where
they made the baby.

01:57.617 --> 01:58.717
Hey, Earl.

01:58.719 --> 02:02.020
Oh, good, I need
somebody strong.

02:02.022 --> 02:05.991
Uh, would you carry
this over there,

02:05.993 --> 02:09.428
put some coffee in it,

02:09.430 --> 02:11.130
and bring it back to me?

02:14.534 --> 02:16.201
I'll hot this up
in a second.

02:16.203 --> 02:19.404
Just let me hot
this one up first.

02:23.443 --> 02:24.776
What're you doing here?

02:24.778 --> 02:26.345
I know you don't
like me to bother you

02:26.347 --> 02:28.881
during your free time,

02:28.883 --> 02:30.182
but I missed you.

02:30.184 --> 02:31.950
And I want to tell you
something in person.

02:31.952 --> 02:36.555
Well, whatever it is,
I probably have it too.

02:36.557 --> 02:39.391
And I probably had it first.

02:39.393 --> 02:40.926
It's not that.

02:40.928 --> 02:42.995
But now I'm worried.

02:42.997 --> 02:45.097
No, I met with this
law firm in Manhattan,

02:45.099 --> 02:46.665
and they want to
make me a partner.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.100
They're making you a partner?

02:48.102 --> 02:52.171
Well, then they're
gonna catch it too.

02:52.173 --> 02:53.372
So, Randy,

02:53.374 --> 02:55.440
you really are a lawyer?

02:55.442 --> 02:59.378
I thought you just played
lawyers in gay porn.

03:01.414 --> 03:02.481
Thanks.

03:02.483 --> 03:04.583
I will tell my trainer.

03:04.585 --> 03:07.286
He was in gay porn.

03:07.288 --> 03:08.921
Hey, Buzz Lightyear,

03:08.923 --> 03:12.958
I'm still waiting
for that coffee.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.860
All right, well,
I'll be in my booth

03:14.862 --> 03:17.162
working on
my godparent list.

03:17.164 --> 03:19.932
And whoever we pick should be
like one of those

03:19.934 --> 03:24.269
perfect families on TV like,
well, the Brady's,

03:24.271 --> 03:25.737
and the Huxtables...

03:25.739 --> 03:28.941
Or, you know what?
Scratch that last one.

03:30.376 --> 03:32.444
Wow, if you're considering
moving to New York,

03:32.446 --> 03:33.912
it must be a pretty good job.

03:33.914 --> 03:36.215
Well, there's a couple
other reasons.

03:36.217 --> 03:37.516
The bagels.

03:37.518 --> 03:41.086
I have tickets to
<i>Hamilton</i> in seven years.

03:41.088 --> 03:43.655
And there's this girl here
I kind of like.

03:43.657 --> 03:46.458
Who is she?
I'll kill her.

03:46.460 --> 03:49.962
So two of the partners want to
take me out tomorrow night

03:49.964 --> 03:53.065
to some fancy private dinner
at someplace called Beak.

03:53.067 --> 03:54.833
(gasps)
You're going to Beak?

03:54.835 --> 03:56.969
It's hidden away
in a private apartment,

03:56.971 --> 03:59.004
practically under
the Williamsburg Bridge,

03:59.006 --> 04:00.872
so you pretty much
have to walk.

04:00.874 --> 04:04.343
How awful
and chic is that?

04:04.345 --> 04:07.012
I read in <i>Time Out</i> that
that place is so exclusive,

04:07.014 --> 04:09.181
it's technically not
even a restaurant.

04:09.183 --> 04:10.549
Big deal.

04:10.551 --> 04:13.218
This diner gets called
"not a restaurant" all the time.

04:13.220 --> 04:14.987
Hey, did they tell you
to just bring Max,

04:14.989 --> 04:17.322
or was it more of
a "bring whoever"?

04:17.324 --> 04:20.259
-Um...
-I'll take that as a yes.

04:20.261 --> 04:22.761
I'd love to join you
at Beak tomorrow night.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.062
How could I say no to Beak?

04:24.064 --> 04:26.765
It's spring,
so that's peak Beak.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.066
(laughs)

04:28.068 --> 04:29.101
So you want to go?

04:29.103 --> 04:30.435
Want to be my date?

04:30.437 --> 04:32.004
Nah, pass.

04:32.006 --> 04:34.373
Fancy restaurants are one of
the three things I don't do.

04:34.375 --> 04:36.842
You know the other two.

04:36.844 --> 04:40.679
Didn't we blow past
those week one?

04:40.681 --> 04:42.814
Max, are you crazy?

04:42.816 --> 04:45.984
Why, is one of my pupils
getting all small?

04:45.986 --> 04:47.886
It happens now.
I don't know why.

04:47.888 --> 04:49.521
What was that out there?

04:49.523 --> 04:51.089
"Nah, pass."

04:51.091 --> 04:53.458
Randy's not just asking you
to dinner-dinner.

04:53.460 --> 04:54.760
This isn't about food.

04:54.762 --> 04:56.395
It's about your
future together.

04:56.397 --> 04:58.297
He's moving here for you.

04:58.299 --> 05:01.700
You just
"naw pass"-ed on Randy.

05:01.702 --> 05:04.136
Weird, I didn't love your
impression the first time,

05:04.138 --> 05:07.005
but I loved it the second.

05:07.007 --> 05:09.107
Randy's moving here
for a job.

05:09.109 --> 05:11.843
This dinner isn't about
some law partners.

05:11.845 --> 05:14.012
It's about you
and him as partners.

05:14.014 --> 05:16.381
Do you hear words I don't?

05:16.383 --> 05:19.418
You're going to that dinner,
young lady, end of discussion.

05:19.420 --> 05:22.888
Oh, that was so mom-ish!

05:22.890 --> 05:25.557
I wouldn't know.
I've never met one.

05:30.363 --> 05:33.365
(knocking)

05:35.168 --> 05:36.902
Oh, good, this is it.

05:36.904 --> 05:38.403
We knocked on another
apartment door,

05:38.405 --> 05:41.406
but the only thing they
were cooking was meth.

05:41.408 --> 05:43.709
We walked across
a bridge for this?

05:43.711 --> 05:48.513
This is basically my apartment,
except our wild birds are alive.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.282
Randy, you made it.

05:50.284 --> 05:53.919
And I mean, you made it
because you're eating at Beak.

05:53.921 --> 05:55.287
I mean, the wait list
here is longer

05:55.289 --> 05:58.223
than an episode
of HBO's <i>Vinyl.</i>

05:58.225 --> 06:00.525
Max, this is Marissa,
one of the partners.

06:00.527 --> 06:01.727
Marissa, this is Max.

06:01.729 --> 06:02.728
She's my girlfriend.

06:02.730 --> 06:04.029
Max?
Cute.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.330
Is that short for Maxine?

06:05.332 --> 06:08.900
Technically,
it's long for "meh."

06:08.902 --> 06:10.202
Sorry, I don't get it.

06:10.204 --> 06:12.037
Probably because
of the Klonopin I had to take

06:12.039 --> 06:15.073
when that homeless man tried
to talk to me on the way in.

06:15.075 --> 06:18.744
Uh, Max, this is Leila,
another partner at the firm,

06:18.746 --> 06:20.512
and her wife, Lei.

06:20.514 --> 06:23.982
She's not just my wife.
She's also a star on Instagram.

06:23.984 --> 06:27.786
See? I talk about
your accomplishments.

06:27.788 --> 06:31.423
I put wigs on statues

06:31.425 --> 06:34.626
and then photograph them
from behind.

06:36.529 --> 06:37.696
That's it?

06:37.698 --> 06:39.297
That's it.

06:41.567 --> 06:42.567
LEILA: Max...

06:42.569 --> 06:44.102
are you a lawyer too?

06:44.104 --> 06:48.140
Uh, no, but I presided over
a food court or two in my day.

06:48.142 --> 06:50.108
Max and her partner, Caroline,
are in the process

06:50.110 --> 06:51.643
of opening a dessert bar.

06:51.645 --> 06:53.612
And I don't mean "partner"
in the romantic sense.

06:53.614 --> 06:55.914
I've got that
department covered.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.349
Well, welcome,
Randy and Max.

06:57.351 --> 06:59.050
You know, I've been
hoping to add another

06:59.052 --> 07:00.719
straight couple
to the law firm mix,

07:00.721 --> 07:04.623
but, you know, they're
so hard to find nowadays.

07:04.625 --> 07:05.991
Lei and I met on an

07:05.993 --> 07:08.994
<i>Orange is the New Black</i>
<i>message board.</i>

07:08.996 --> 07:12.330
It's kind of become
the lesbian Tinder.

07:12.332 --> 07:14.533
Uh, Randy,
wasn't there rumor of a third?

07:14.535 --> 07:17.736
Oh, I keep pitching that,
but he "likes me too much."

07:19.305 --> 07:21.740
Again,
don't quite get it.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.208
Little hazy.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.143
Well, I'll have to tell
the chef he's preparing

07:25.145 --> 07:26.812
oyster foam for six.

07:26.814 --> 07:29.014
I'm sorry, "oyster foam"?

07:29.016 --> 07:31.049
Foam from an oyster?

07:31.051 --> 07:34.486
That sounds delicious.

07:34.488 --> 07:39.024
I know your idea of fine dining
is a ham and cheese Hot Pocket,

07:39.026 --> 07:40.759
but I am really glad
you came.

07:40.761 --> 07:41.860
Oh, here's Lenin.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.995
Um, Randy, Max,
this is Lenin.

07:43.997 --> 07:47.199
He's the chef.
And my lover.

07:52.472 --> 07:56.107
We have sex too.

07:56.109 --> 07:58.243
Lei and I are "post sex."

07:58.245 --> 08:01.279
All intimacy,
no penetration.

08:04.817 --> 08:08.186
I'll be serving a meal of
seven bird-themed courses,

08:08.188 --> 08:10.755
each one it's own unique
flight of fancy.

08:10.757 --> 08:14.259
Not my words, a very giggly
Anderson Cooper.

08:14.261 --> 08:15.994
Now, before we begin,
do either of you

08:15.996 --> 08:17.529
have any food allergies?

08:17.531 --> 08:21.099
Just one: birds.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.468
I don't get her, either.

08:23.470 --> 08:25.770
Let's all sit.

08:25.772 --> 08:26.771
Max.

08:28.574 --> 08:31.810
Why do you want me to
sit that far from the table?

08:31.812 --> 08:33.678
That's me being polite.

08:36.849 --> 08:39.017
You are in
for such a treat.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.286
Lenin is a real artist.

08:41.288 --> 08:43.755
He spends all day
making these teeny-tiny,

08:43.757 --> 08:47.626
delicate little meals,
which is why I pay our rent.

08:50.596 --> 08:52.831
Our first course
is a French delicacy.

08:52.833 --> 08:56.234
The Ortolan Bunting bird,
roasted and eaten whole.

08:58.571 --> 09:02.240
Just grasp the bird by its head
and start eating at the feet.

09:02.242 --> 09:04.709
Enjoy.
Obviously.

09:10.249 --> 09:13.451
Can't wait to get that
bird foot in my mouth.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.561
How's the baby pigeon
and oyster foam, Max?

09:22.563 --> 09:23.962
Oh, delicious.

09:23.964 --> 09:27.165
It's amazing how full
babies can make you.

09:29.268 --> 09:30.769
RANDY: No, Lei,
way too many photos

09:30.771 --> 09:32.704
of me eating foam.

09:32.706 --> 09:34.506
Like a rabid dog.

09:34.508 --> 09:37.375
(knocking)

09:38.511 --> 09:40.245
Oh, good.
This is it.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.080
The guy who opened
the other apartment door

09:42.082 --> 09:44.249
wasn't wearing pants.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.784
Or underwear.

09:45.786 --> 09:48.086
Or was circumcised.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.521
Hi!
I'm here.

09:49.523 --> 09:50.889
What did I miss?

09:50.891 --> 09:54.392
The point of literally every
movie we see together.

09:54.394 --> 09:56.962
Marissa, this is Caroline,
Max's business partner.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.363
She texted she was coming.

09:58.365 --> 10:01.399
She's usually not covered
in this much sweat.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.368
Sorry, I had to run
across the bridge,

10:03.370 --> 10:05.937
'cause you need a credit card
for one of those city bikes.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.272
Um, if I had a credit card,

10:07.274 --> 10:10.241
why would I be riding
a damn bike?

10:10.243 --> 10:13.178
I'm at Beak.
I'm trendy again!

10:14.013 --> 10:15.447
Fifth course.

10:15.449 --> 10:18.383
Tiny poached noisy scrubbird
with fiddle ferns

10:18.385 --> 10:20.018
and fermented egg.

10:20.020 --> 10:23.221
Oh, that sounds so gross.
I bet it's great.

10:25.324 --> 10:27.425
Max, eat.

10:27.427 --> 10:28.760
I sure will.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.328
When I used to watch
Tweety Bird,

10:30.330 --> 10:34.499
all I could think was,
"God, that looks delicious."

10:34.501 --> 10:36.601
You're doing great.

10:36.603 --> 10:38.436
Who wants some more wine?

10:38.438 --> 10:40.105
I'm guessing Max.

10:40.107 --> 10:41.640
I can't believe we're here,

10:41.642 --> 10:44.609
eating the finest--
what'd he say this was?

10:44.611 --> 10:46.111
Blue jay?

10:46.113 --> 10:47.846
Aren't you proud of me?

10:47.848 --> 10:49.447
I got through
the first four courses.

10:49.449 --> 10:52.584
That's more courses than
I finished in high school.

10:52.586 --> 10:55.720
Oh, look at this pretentious,

10:55.722 --> 10:58.390
deliberately relaxed
large napkin.

10:58.392 --> 11:01.693
Love it and hate it.

11:01.695 --> 11:03.028
What is that?

11:03.030 --> 11:04.896
This first four courses!

11:04.898 --> 11:06.564
I cheated,
like in high school!

11:06.566 --> 11:08.600
I couldn't eat it;
it's gross.

11:08.602 --> 11:11.936
No, gross is when you
hand the guy at Del Taco

11:11.938 --> 11:15.173
65 cents and tell him
to surprise you.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.242
You are judging me
for not eating most of my

11:17.244 --> 11:19.210
Saturday morning
cartoon lineup?

11:19.212 --> 11:21.579
You want to chomp down on
Foghorn Leghorn?

11:21.581 --> 11:25.450
When a great guy like Randy
is moving to New York for you,

11:25.452 --> 11:28.653
yes, you have to eat
your childhood favorites!

11:29.889 --> 11:31.856
Anyone like to come see
the de-spining

11:31.858 --> 11:33.591
of the tiny trumpeter bird?

11:33.593 --> 11:36.161
This could push me over
a million followers.

11:38.130 --> 11:40.065
I can't eat that, Caroline.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.499
And I have nowhere to put it

11:41.501 --> 11:43.668
My bra is at crazy capacity.

11:43.670 --> 11:47.138
The fire marshal almost
kicked out my left boob.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.506
Why can't you just try it?

11:48.508 --> 11:51.609
You've had worse things
in your mouth.

11:52.845 --> 11:54.946
He's moving here
to be with you.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.548
He's moving here for a job.

11:56.550 --> 11:58.783
Look, whatever comes next,
just put it in your mouth

11:58.785 --> 12:00.118
and eat it.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.320
Well, I did not know
the bird was gonna be alive.

12:02.322 --> 12:05.523
Worst part?
Making eye contact.

12:06.992 --> 12:09.661
Creamed kimchi
and pelican tongue

12:09.663 --> 12:11.796
with Asian pear.

12:11.798 --> 12:13.565
LENIN: Enjoy.

12:13.567 --> 12:16.534
The least you can do
is swallow a little tongue.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.403
Tongue swallowing?
Foam?

12:18.405 --> 12:21.606
This isn't a restaurant;
it's a heroin overdose.

12:24.376 --> 12:25.376
I love you.

12:32.718 --> 12:34.452
Good for you, Max!

12:34.454 --> 12:36.721
This is real growth.

12:36.723 --> 12:40.658
Is it bad I feel like the
tongue is tasting me back?

12:47.833 --> 12:49.534
Max, you look sweaty.

12:49.536 --> 12:52.737
Like when you try
to do math.

12:53.806 --> 12:57.942
I think that tongue
is looking for an exit.

12:57.944 --> 13:00.812
Randy, we're really excited
for you to come work for us.

13:00.814 --> 13:02.180
How fast can you move
to New York?

13:02.182 --> 13:06.718
Not as fast as I have to
get to that bathroom.

13:06.720 --> 13:08.052
Excuse us,

13:08.054 --> 13:11.089
we have to go to the
little sparrow's room.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.891
Nope, it's cool,
false alarm.

13:12.893 --> 13:15.226
Nope, real alarm.
Very real alarm.

13:15.228 --> 13:17.562
-Should I come in with you?
-No!

13:17.564 --> 13:19.430
Even I don't want to
go in there!

13:19.432 --> 13:22.300
I doubt this door is
soundproof, so talk loud.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.102
Just start with
your normal volume,

13:24.104 --> 13:27.405
and then dial it
down a notch.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.073
Oh, Marissa!

13:29.075 --> 13:35.747
You have to tell me where you
found these fabulous glasses.

13:35.749 --> 13:37.715
Restoration Hardware?

13:37.717 --> 13:40.885
Crate and Barrel?

13:40.887 --> 13:42.620
CAROLINE: Restoration Hardware
Modern?

13:42.622 --> 13:43.788
West Elm?
CB2?

13:43.790 --> 13:45.557
CB3?
Is there one of those yet?

13:45.559 --> 13:46.858
-(vomiting)
-You know what?

13:46.860 --> 13:48.026
Let's get some music going!

13:48.028 --> 13:49.594
Like some really loud dubstep,

13:49.596 --> 13:51.029
'cause I'm running
out of breath.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.964
Oh, there's no music
allowed here.

13:52.966 --> 13:57.135
It would get in the way of
hearing the symphony of taste.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.236
Not my words.

13:58.238 --> 14:00.805
Okay,
they were my words.

14:00.807 --> 14:02.140
I think I'd like
to make a toast.

14:02.142 --> 14:03.741
Oh, no, please don't
make a toast.

14:03.743 --> 14:06.945
I've begun not to like you.

14:12.384 --> 14:13.518
Seriously, Lenin.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.053
Not even a little
light piano?

14:15.055 --> 14:17.755
You don't need to reinvent
the freaking wheel here.

14:17.757 --> 14:19.157
Hey, Caroline, please.
Just sit.

14:19.159 --> 14:21.025
You know what, I see if
I have another Klonopin.

14:21.027 --> 14:23.828
-I'm fine.
-It's not for you.

14:23.830 --> 14:25.496
Caroline.

14:25.498 --> 14:26.798
Should I go in there?

14:26.800 --> 14:28.433
'Cause I am not hearing
the standard

14:28.435 --> 14:30.935
tinkle and a hand wash.

14:30.937 --> 14:32.503
No, don't move.
Stay there.

14:32.505 --> 14:35.373
That noise is just the pipes
backing up a little.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.374
Well, a lot.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.547
CAROLINE: Oh, Lord!

14:42.549 --> 14:43.581
They're young.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.783
(chuckles)

14:46.719 --> 14:49.587
My camera needs
to be in there.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.122
Enough with the camera!

14:51.124 --> 14:53.391
I'm alive!

14:53.393 --> 14:55.560
(knocking)

14:55.562 --> 14:57.729
Max.

14:57.731 --> 14:59.430
Where are you going?

14:59.432 --> 15:01.966
Anywhere but here!

15:01.968 --> 15:03.301
RANDY: Max, seriously!

15:03.303 --> 15:04.903
(knocking)
What's going on in there?

15:04.905 --> 15:06.537
CAROLINE:
Everything's okay in here!

15:06.539 --> 15:09.207
We'll be out in a minute.

15:09.209 --> 15:12.410
RANDY: If you're not gonna
let me in, at least--

15:16.115 --> 15:17.282
Max!

15:17.284 --> 15:19.050
Wait up!

15:19.052 --> 15:21.619
You don't have to be
embarrassed in front of me.

15:21.621 --> 15:23.821
I've seen worse.

15:23.823 --> 15:25.890
Okay, no I haven't.

15:25.892 --> 15:27.091
Just go away!

15:27.093 --> 15:28.860
I can't take
that sad look.

15:28.862 --> 15:30.261
It's the same look
you gave Chestnut

15:30.263 --> 15:32.597
that time he crapped
on the couch.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.300
I'm fine alone;
you didn't have to leave.

15:35.302 --> 15:36.434
No, I did.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.670
They couldn't possibly
think one person

15:38.672 --> 15:40.805
was responsible for all that.

15:40.807 --> 15:42.373
Plus, I don't want
to leave you.

15:42.375 --> 15:43.474
You're sick.

15:43.476 --> 15:45.476
I think it's beyond sick.

15:45.478 --> 15:48.046
I lost bone mass in there.

15:48.048 --> 15:51.049
My shoes are too big now.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.617
I'm so embarrassed!

15:52.619 --> 15:53.785
Hey, it happens.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.086
You got a stomach ache.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.955
You're just not
used to rich food.

15:56.957 --> 15:59.190
I'm not used to
rich anything.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.159
And if this is Randy's world--

16:01.161 --> 16:04.062
uh, bird bones
and pretentious people--

16:04.064 --> 16:08.666
then maybe my body is
telling me I can't take it.

16:08.668 --> 16:12.704
Max, if I got used to buying
earrings at the AMPM,

16:12.706 --> 16:15.673
you can get used to fancy food
and pretentious people.

16:15.675 --> 16:16.674
You don't get it!

16:16.676 --> 16:18.910
He is moving here for me.

16:18.912 --> 16:21.446
Oh, do you think so?

16:21.448 --> 16:22.580
I wish your best friend

16:22.582 --> 16:24.649
had been telling you that
for two days.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.150
He's moving his whole life.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.785
I don't know how
to do that.

16:27.787 --> 16:30.855
I didn't even know how to react
when he moved my chair for me.

16:30.857 --> 16:32.323
You were right,
it's not about the food;

16:32.325 --> 16:34.525
it's about our future,
and I just vomited

16:34.527 --> 16:37.762
all over our future.

16:37.764 --> 16:39.864
What?

16:39.866 --> 16:42.767
I hate to say this,
but you need a mint.

16:42.769 --> 16:45.670
Sorry, I love you,
but you need a mint.

16:45.672 --> 16:48.306
I need to disappear.

16:48.308 --> 16:51.242
What do you think
of the name Sheila Newman?

16:52.244 --> 16:53.244
Max!

16:53.246 --> 16:54.178
Randy.

16:54.180 --> 16:57.749
Great, just in time
to see me jump.

16:57.751 --> 16:58.983
What happened?
Where'd you go?

16:58.985 --> 17:00.685
Oh, I jumped on
that bike so fast,

17:00.687 --> 17:03.254
my man parts are no
longer talking to me.

17:03.256 --> 17:06.057
She didn't want to be
sick in front of you.

17:06.059 --> 17:08.159
You got sick?

17:08.161 --> 17:10.061
Okay, fine,
we all heard it.

17:10.063 --> 17:12.630
But why did you leave
without saying something?

17:12.632 --> 17:14.232
Because words were
the only thing

17:14.234 --> 17:17.568
not coming out
of my mouth.

17:17.570 --> 17:20.071
Max?

17:20.073 --> 17:21.773
You're not gonna
look at me?

17:21.775 --> 17:22.840
I can't.

17:22.842 --> 17:24.776
Wait, here.

17:24.778 --> 17:26.778
Now she can.

17:26.780 --> 17:27.945
You better get back there.

17:27.947 --> 17:29.547
I don't want you
to lose that job.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.082
I don't want that job.

17:31.084 --> 17:32.717
I don't know how many more
pills Marissa took,

17:32.719 --> 17:35.887
but she passed out
in a pot of clam steam.

17:35.889 --> 17:37.922
I missed clam steam?

17:37.924 --> 17:40.091
I've been reading about
his clam steam.

17:40.093 --> 17:42.827
Please stop saying
"clam steam."

17:42.829 --> 17:45.063
I can actually
smell the words.

17:45.065 --> 17:46.264
Okay, Max.

17:46.266 --> 17:47.932
You are starting
to turn green again,

17:47.934 --> 17:50.935
so why don't you hop on,
and I will ride you home

17:50.937 --> 17:52.770
on my bicycle
like a real man.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.172
I don't know, Randy.

17:54.174 --> 17:56.340
A lot of stuff came up
for me at that dinner.

17:56.342 --> 17:57.508
And I'm not just
talking about

17:57.510 --> 18:01.045
every single thing
I ate this year.

18:01.047 --> 18:04.482
I mean, maybe I'm
not right for you.

18:04.484 --> 18:05.950
Hey.

18:05.952 --> 18:08.086
Don't be so hard on yourself
about tonight.

18:08.088 --> 18:09.387
I mean, look at me.

18:09.389 --> 18:12.623
I'm not brave enough
to eat in that diner.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.425
Come here, you.

18:14.427 --> 18:19.130
Maybe wait another
60 seconds.

18:19.132 --> 18:21.265
I think we are different.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.067
But we kind of go together.

18:23.069 --> 18:27.538
Like peppered baby bird
bladder and pesto.

18:27.540 --> 18:28.573
Oh, no.

18:28.575 --> 18:30.208
Oh, my God.

18:30.210 --> 18:33.411
That's gonna do it!

18:36.915 --> 18:41.352
Wrong night to be
driving a convertible.

18:41.354 --> 18:44.555
Oh, wait--
no, no, no, no, no, no.

18:47.593 --> 18:50.595
(both laugh)

18:52.397 --> 18:55.566
So how's your first
diner burger?

18:55.568 --> 18:57.201
It's not bad.

18:57.203 --> 18:58.636
I'm getting
a little something.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.004
Um...mesquite?

19:00.006 --> 19:03.407
Yeah, they die in the fan
and then fall on the grill.

19:05.344 --> 19:09.046
I'll take mosquito burger
over pelican any day.

19:09.048 --> 19:10.548
Interesting, Randy.

19:10.550 --> 19:13.684
You get two waitresses
paying attention to you

19:13.686 --> 19:15.887
and most people get none.

19:15.889 --> 19:17.755
Like that one over there,

19:17.757 --> 19:20.091
over there,
and that gentleman over there

19:20.093 --> 19:22.326
who's just giving up
and leaving.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.629
Fine, Han, we will
go over to the counter

19:24.631 --> 19:25.696
and continue to talk.

19:28.901 --> 19:31.335
I know I say a lot
of stuff about you,

19:31.337 --> 19:33.004
especially to your face,

19:33.006 --> 19:34.705
but thank you for your
help last night.

19:34.707 --> 19:37.141
I know you would have done
the same thing for me.

19:37.143 --> 19:38.543
But if I ever get that sick,

19:38.545 --> 19:40.945
you have my permission
to kill me.

19:40.947 --> 19:43.514
I mean, when you went into that
toilet, looking for my earring,

19:43.516 --> 19:46.717
I knew I had found
my post-sex partner.

19:47.853 --> 19:50.354
SOPHIE: You did that for her?

19:50.356 --> 19:51.589
Wow!

19:51.591 --> 19:54.158
And all this time,
we've been looking for

19:54.160 --> 19:56.627
the perfect couple
to be godparents,

19:56.629 --> 19:59.830
and they're right
under our noses.

20:01.066 --> 20:03.467
Girl-on-girl godparents.

20:03.469 --> 20:04.769
I like it.

20:04.771 --> 20:08.072
You two girls are gonna
be great with the baby.

20:08.074 --> 20:09.507
SOPHIE: I mean, Caroline,

20:09.509 --> 20:12.910
you were elbow-deep
in Max's upchuck.

20:12.912 --> 20:15.346
I mean, I wouldn't even
do that for my own father

20:15.348 --> 20:18.216
when he swallowed

20:28.294 --> 20:30.761
let Max do
the breast feeding.

20:30.763 --> 20:34.165

20:36.236 --> 20:39.003

20:39.005 --> 20:40.571

20:42.742 --> 20:45.743
