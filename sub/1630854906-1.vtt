WEBVTT

00:49.467 --> 00:50.509
Hey!

00:55.556 --> 00:56.599
Hey!

01:18.329 --> 01:21.290
No. No, no, no, no, no.

01:21.290 --> 01:23.042
That's three in a row, Pops.

01:23.042 --> 01:24.752
Maybe we should go back
to Go Fish.

01:24.752 --> 01:26.670
No. Shuffle up, deal again.

01:26.670 --> 01:28.464
Just give me a minute.

01:28.464 --> 01:29.882
I should grab this.

01:29.882 --> 01:31.342
Aram, what a nice surprise.

01:31.509 --> 01:33.803
- Mr. Cooper.
<i>- Charlene was just asking about you,</i>

01:33.803 --> 01:35.387
and I couldn't tell her anything,

01:35.387 --> 01:37.139
where you're living,
what you're up to these days.

01:37.139 --> 01:38.724
<i>I know, I know.
I'm sorry.</i>

01:38.724 --> 01:41.727
I've been meaning to.
I-I just--

01:41.727 --> 01:45.356
I've been getting settled,
but I'm good. I'm really good.

01:45.356 --> 01:47.316
<i>- I'm great, actually.</i>
- How's New York?

01:47.316 --> 01:49.151
Uh, well, maybe I could
tell you in person.

01:49.151 --> 01:52.196
You guys are here, aren't you?
The task force is in New York?

01:52.196 --> 01:53.864
No, we're not even up and running.

01:53.864 --> 01:55.866
Reddington took the sisters
home to Guatemala.

01:55.866 --> 01:57.034
That was over six months ago.

01:57.034 --> 01:58.994
We're just twiddling our thumbs
till he gets back.

01:58.994 --> 02:00.996
Well, Mr. Reddington is here.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.832
What? Where?

02:02.832 --> 02:04.416
<i>I just saw him.</i>

02:04.875 --> 02:06.669
Saw him? In Manhattan?

02:06.669 --> 02:07.962
Yeah. Outside the Met.

02:07.962 --> 02:09.338
Across the street from the museum.

02:09.338 --> 02:11.757
He was, uh...
He was just walking.

02:11.757 --> 02:14.385
- By himself?
<i>- Yeah, no security. No car, either.</i>

02:14.385 --> 02:16.512
I called out to him, and he saw me,

02:16.512 --> 02:18.264
and then he just got in a cab.

02:18.264 --> 02:20.432
Aram, are you sure?
You're sure it was him?

02:20.432 --> 02:22.184
Yeah, it was him.
He looked kind of different.

02:22.184 --> 02:24.228
But it was... It was definitely him.

02:27.565 --> 02:29.149
Mr. Cooper?
A-Are you still there?

02:29.149 --> 02:31.527
Yes, I'm sorry. It's just

02:31.527 --> 02:34.530
things were pretty good
with Reddington before he left.

02:34.530 --> 02:36.615
We'd agreed to be more
forthcoming with each other.

02:36.615 --> 02:38.534
- If he <i>were</i> back--
- He is.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.912
Okay, but if you're right,
why was he there?

02:41.912 --> 02:43.747
<i>What was he doing?</i>

02:45.124 --> 02:47.084
It's a bomb!

02:47.084 --> 02:48.502
Aram, are you all right?

02:48.502 --> 02:51.088
<i>Aram? Aram, are you all right?</i>

03:15.738 --> 03:17.990
Please tell me
you're coming in to help.

03:17.990 --> 03:19.909
You're still at it?
How much have you done?

03:19.909 --> 03:21.076
<i>About half.</i>

03:21.076 --> 03:23.954
I swear, it's taking me longer
to document Marvin Gerard's case

03:23.954 --> 03:26.165
than it did to expose him
in the first place.

03:26.165 --> 03:27.875
- Take a break.
<i>- I can't.</i>

03:27.875 --> 03:29.376
Raymond won't be away forever.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.211
We need to take advantage
of this downtime.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.380
- You still haven't heard from him?
<i>- Nothing.</i>

03:33.380 --> 03:36.717
There's a bed and breakfast
in Quezaltenango.

03:36.717 --> 03:39.970
He's probably having a champurrado
on the terrace.

03:40.679 --> 03:42.181
Aram just saw him in New York.

03:42.932 --> 03:45.434
- Say that again?
<i>- Apparently, Raymond's back.</i>

03:45.434 --> 03:47.436
And probably connected to
an explosion that happened

03:47.436 --> 03:49.897
a few minutes ago
at a townhouse on the Upper East Side.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.315
I'll give Chuck a call right away.

03:51.315 --> 03:53.025
<i>I just tried. No answer.</i>

03:53.025 --> 03:55.027
Which isn't surprising.
If he's blowing up townhouses,

03:55.027 --> 03:56.820
he probably doesn't feel like
taking questions.

03:56.820 --> 03:58.822
<i>-No idea what it's about?</i>
- No.

03:59.114 --> 04:00.366
But it can't be good.

04:00.366 --> 04:02.117
I'm coming in.

04:02.117 --> 04:04.536
I have to admit, I was
getting used to the time off,

04:04.536 --> 04:06.372
being home with Charlene and Agnes.

04:06.372 --> 04:07.456
I feel old.

04:07.456 --> 04:09.833
You got this, old man.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.839
Well, I'm good.

04:18.425 --> 04:19.969
I mean, the truth is,

04:21.220 --> 04:22.846
every day's a struggle.

04:22.846 --> 04:26.350
Not just recovery, um,
which so far, it's...

04:27.476 --> 04:29.186
Look. I-I'm okay.

04:30.813 --> 04:32.481
It's just mostly, uh...

04:34.066 --> 04:35.985
I have a hard time
letting go of the past.

04:35.985 --> 04:39.321
I mean, it's in my nature
to want to fix things and...

04:42.574 --> 04:43.701
Take your time, Donald.

04:46.328 --> 04:48.831
It's just hard f-for me to accept.

04:50.499 --> 04:53.252
I lost someone I loved,

04:56.296 --> 04:58.007
and it can't be undone.

04:58.632 --> 04:59.967
I mean, I...

04:59.967 --> 05:03.303
I became an addict.
I hit bottom.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.471
Uh...

05:05.514 --> 05:08.100
I wish it didn't happen, but it did.

05:09.226 --> 05:12.438
And letting that go and leaving that be...

05:14.356 --> 05:16.108
It's hard for me.

05:17.735 --> 05:21.447
But, uh, here I am.

05:21.447 --> 05:23.073
And today...

05:23.615 --> 05:25.868
I'm 311 days sober.

05:26.952 --> 05:29.997
That's wonderful. Good for you.

05:42.926 --> 05:45.846
You don't answer your phone?

05:46.722 --> 05:48.515
I carried that Bureau phone for two months

05:48.515 --> 05:49.975
after Reddington left.

05:49.975 --> 05:51.852
It didn't ring, I put it away.

05:52.603 --> 05:55.606
- So, uh, is he back?
- Not exactly.

05:56.398 --> 05:59.651
Come on.
I'll explain on the way to New York.

06:10.621 --> 06:11.914
- Ed Pickford.
- Sergeant.

06:11.914 --> 06:14.166
I'm Agent Ressler. This is Agent Zuma.

06:14.166 --> 06:17.127
- Apologies for the big foot.
- Man, you FBI guys work fast.

06:17.294 --> 06:19.171
My people were still clearing
the area when the Bureau

06:19.171 --> 06:21.173
let us know a team was coming up
from DC to run point.

06:21.173 --> 06:22.633
How are things looking?

06:22.633 --> 06:25.302
A lot of damage.
Fire's saying a single device,

06:25.302 --> 06:27.054
detonated in a room on the top floor.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.223
- Anyone hurt?
- Unknown at this time.

06:29.223 --> 06:30.516
Suspects?

06:30.516 --> 06:32.684
Look, I'd love to be able to tell you

06:32.684 --> 06:36.105
we know what happened here,
but to be honest, our hands are tied.

06:36.105 --> 06:37.940
Especially since we can't
enter the building.

06:37.940 --> 06:39.441
Why not?

06:39.441 --> 06:41.151
'Cause it belongs
to the Chinese government.

06:41.151 --> 06:43.654
It's registered
as an official annex of the Consulate.

06:43.654 --> 06:46.156
- An annex?
- We've got over 100 foreign missions

06:46.156 --> 06:48.408
in the city,
plenty with multiple locations.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.661
No police inside without permission.

06:50.661 --> 06:52.955
He blew up part of the Chinese Consulate?

06:52.955 --> 06:55.791
"He"? You fellas have a theory
on who might've done this?

06:55.791 --> 06:57.751
No, not really,
but how do we find the person

06:57.751 --> 06:59.711
- that can give us permission?
- You won't have to.

06:59.711 --> 07:01.380
Something tells me he's about to find you.

07:01.380 --> 07:04.341
Excuse me. May I please speak
to whomever's in charge?

07:04.341 --> 07:06.009
Agent Ressler, FBI.

07:06.009 --> 07:08.971
My name in Chin Yao,
head of this Consular Post.

07:08.971 --> 07:11.223
Mr. Chin, we're just beginning
our investigation,

07:11.223 --> 07:14.059
but we believe this explosion
was a targeted attack.

07:14.059 --> 07:16.478
I see. And who do you
believe was responsible?

07:16.478 --> 07:18.647
Well, we don't know, but you can be sure

07:18.647 --> 07:20.899
that the Bureau will keep you
informed of our progress.

07:20.899 --> 07:22.818
I see the building has security cameras.

07:22.818 --> 07:25.154
We'd appreciate you giving us
access to that footage.

07:25.154 --> 07:26.989
I'm afraid that's not possible.

07:26.989 --> 07:28.574
And why's that?

07:28.574 --> 07:31.243
Because we are not requesting
an American investigation.

07:31.243 --> 07:33.370
Someone set off a device
in one of your buildings,

07:33.370 --> 07:34.997
and you don't want to know who or why?

07:34.997 --> 07:36.582
If a crime was committed, my staff is

07:36.582 --> 07:38.959
more than capable of handling
the matter on its own.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.836
How? Your staff has
no law enforcement authority here.

07:40.836 --> 07:43.297
I'm not here to debate the matter,
Agent Ressler.

07:43.297 --> 07:44.715
I'm informing you.

07:44.715 --> 07:46.049
- Eddie.
- Yeah, Billy?

07:46.049 --> 07:48.093
- One down. This the Bureau?
- Yes.

07:48.093 --> 07:49.595
Sir, you're gonna want to see this.

07:49.595 --> 07:51.471
Agent Ressler, to be clear,

07:51.471 --> 07:54.016
the FBI is not authorized
to enter the premises.

07:54.016 --> 07:56.018
The property is inviolable.

07:56.018 --> 07:59.104
By authority of the Vienna Convention
on Consular...

08:03.650 --> 08:05.527
Best we can tell,
she was the only one on the floor

08:05.527 --> 08:09.072
at the time of the explosion,
but we'll keep looking.

08:09.072 --> 08:11.491
With that much force,
why's the body still intact?

08:11.491 --> 08:14.995
We think the device was sitting
on a mail cart in this area.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.288
Looks like she got partial coverage

08:16.288 --> 08:18.040
from the desk and this file cabinet.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.917
And there's this.

08:19.917 --> 08:22.669
Looks like a laptop under her right arm.

08:25.547 --> 08:26.882
Can you identify this woman?

08:26.882 --> 08:28.675
Your presence here is unlawful!

08:28.675 --> 08:30.093
Yeah, we heard you,
but you're not here

08:30.093 --> 08:31.470
to debate the matter, remember?

08:31.470 --> 08:34.681
At this point, you'll have to
take that up with the Attorney General.

08:34.681 --> 08:37.851
Yeah, this is now a federal
homicide investigation.

08:43.482 --> 08:47.903
No, Wujing, not at all.

08:47.903 --> 08:49.571
The FBI is inside.

08:49.571 --> 08:51.865
They have recovered your associate's body.

08:52.574 --> 08:53.700
How?

08:54.868 --> 08:57.746
You were supposed to prevent
them from gaining access.

08:57.746 --> 09:01.291
Don't tell me what I was supposed to do.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.210
The Ministry doesn't know I helped you.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.462
Remember who you're talking to

09:05.462 --> 09:08.465
I took a risk out of respect
for our history.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.550
But you're a fugitive.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.344
If our government knew
anything about--

09:14.263 --> 09:15.847
Moores is dead.

09:15.847 --> 09:17.391
We needed her help.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.018
She told us enough.

09:20.811 --> 09:22.604
Everything stays on schedule.

09:24.481 --> 09:25.774
It was Reddington.

09:26.942 --> 09:29.903
He'll do anything to keep me
from proving the truth.

09:30.612 --> 09:31.989
But I will.

09:33.490 --> 09:36.118
And he will suffer
for what he has done.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.335
Okay, you're not
gonna believe this.

09:45.335 --> 09:47.629
The body recovered
from the Chinese Consulate?

09:47.629 --> 09:49.298
It was Jennifer Anne Moores.

09:49.298 --> 09:51.883
Moores. How do I know that name?

09:53.135 --> 09:55.220
Jennifer Moores
was once on The Blacklist.

09:55.220 --> 09:56.930
She was a key member of a heist crew

09:56.930 --> 09:58.765
known as The Fribourg Confidence.

09:58.765 --> 10:01.351
Thieves who specialized
in robbing criminals.

10:01.351 --> 10:04.396
<i>Back then, Elizabeth hired them
to steal a flash drive</i>

10:04.396 --> 10:06.398
<i>from one of Raymond's
safe deposit boxes.</i>

10:06.398 --> 10:07.524
<i>I remember.</i>

10:11.820 --> 10:14.406
But we arrested them.
So why isn't she in prison?

10:14.406 --> 10:16.742
Because she cooperated
with our investigation.

10:16.742 --> 10:19.745
And it seems like that went
a long way with the US Attorney.

10:19.745 --> 10:23.081
She did 19 months at Hazelton
and was paroled five months ago.

10:23.081 --> 10:25.584
I don't get it.
What's a former Blacklister on parole

10:25.584 --> 10:28.170
doing at an annex of
the Chinese Consulate in New York?

10:28.170 --> 10:30.797
Moores was a master thief.
It's reasonable to assume

10:30.797 --> 10:32.758
that she was hired to steal something.

10:32.758 --> 10:35.177
By the Chinese?
Why would they look to her?

10:35.177 --> 10:37.137
And how's all this connected
to Reddington?

10:37.137 --> 10:39.389
I will say this,
whatever she was doing,

10:39.389 --> 10:42.267
clearly Reddington didn't want it done.

10:42.267 --> 10:44.186
We do have a lead.

10:44.186 --> 10:46.772
Problem is, we don't have Aram.

10:46.772 --> 10:49.107
We could call the Lab,
have them send another tech,

10:49.107 --> 10:50.484
but I don't like flying blind.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.194
I'd prefer to keep this
task force only

10:52.194 --> 10:54.446
until we know what we're dealing with.

10:54.446 --> 10:56.782
- You want to bring on a new agent?
- At least one.

10:56.782 --> 10:59.034
Cynthia's having Main Justice send a list.

10:59.034 --> 11:00.911
Aram and Alina won't be easy to replace,

11:00.911 --> 11:02.871
but we can't do this just us.

11:02.871 --> 11:05.082
In the meantime,
I know someone who can help.

11:05.082 --> 11:06.708
One of Reddington's people?

11:06.708 --> 11:09.461
Believe me,
if you want to break into a computer,

11:09.461 --> 11:10.921
this is the guy.

11:16.551 --> 11:17.677
Go for Chuck.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.429
Hey, Chuck. It's Dembe.

11:19.429 --> 11:20.764
I need to speak to Raymond.

11:20.764 --> 11:23.934
Dembe. Hey, buddy. It's been months.

11:23.934 --> 11:25.560
You don't write.
You don't call.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.062
You were supposed to call me

11:27.062 --> 11:29.147
when Raymond got back into the States.

11:29.147 --> 11:30.607
And I will.

11:30.607 --> 11:32.234
As soon as I hear,
you'll be the first to know.

11:32.234 --> 11:35.112
Well, top five. Mmm, maybe ten.

11:35.112 --> 11:36.530
So you're not with him?

11:37.531 --> 11:39.491
Are you saying he's already back?

11:39.491 --> 11:41.576
<i>- How do you know?</i>
- How do you not know?

11:41.576 --> 11:42.994
Hey. It's Reddington.

11:42.994 --> 11:45.163
I only know what he wants me to know.

11:45.163 --> 11:47.165
Sent me a postcard a few months back.

11:47.165 --> 11:50.210
- A postcard?
- With a picture of the Tower of London.

11:50.377 --> 11:53.171
<i>All it said was,
"Quick visit to the Tower.</i>

11:53.171 --> 11:56.133
Invited to the Key Ceremony.
Super fun.

11:56.133 --> 11:59.845
Wimbledon tomorrow.
Legoland Friday. Red."

11:59.845 --> 12:01.430
He went to London?

12:01.430 --> 12:05.517
I guess so, but then the, uh,
card was postmarked in Uruguay,

12:05.517 --> 12:07.060
and, uh, Dembe,

12:07.060 --> 12:09.563
<i>you understand he signed it "Red."</i>

12:09.563 --> 12:11.690
Yes, I heard.

12:11.898 --> 12:14.860
What's going on?
Why so many public places?

12:14.860 --> 12:17.028
<i>And who's handling his security?</i>

12:17.028 --> 12:20.449
Chuck, make some calls,
see if anyone has heard from him.

12:20.449 --> 12:22.951
I was gonna ask him for permission
to go see Tadashi.

12:22.951 --> 12:24.578
<i>Yeah, I can't help you with that,</i>

12:24.578 --> 12:26.413
but I'll get on the rest of it.

12:26.413 --> 12:27.789
Hey, wish I could be more help,

12:27.789 --> 12:31.543
but I don't know where
the big man is or what's doing.

12:41.553 --> 12:45.140
You! You had my son and me arrested?

12:45.140 --> 12:47.392
Ms. Ito, you're not under arrest.

12:47.392 --> 12:49.978
- These agents were just--
- These agents made us

12:49.978 --> 12:52.522
wear blindfolds and ride
in the back of a van!

12:52.522 --> 12:55.275
There are security protocols.
I'm very sorry.

12:55.275 --> 12:58.195
Whoa! Mom, are you seeing this?

12:58.195 --> 12:59.821
It's a War Room.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.287
Do you have any idea what kind of systems

13:07.287 --> 13:09.289
must be powering a place like this?

13:09.748 --> 13:11.875
Don't get excited. We're not staying.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.544
Where's Raymond, hmm?

13:15.504 --> 13:17.589
I want to have a word with that man.

13:17.589 --> 13:19.508
Raymond doesn't know you're here.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.927
Please. Let me explain.

13:23.094 --> 13:25.096
You left Raymond?

13:25.096 --> 13:27.474
- You don't work together anymore?
- No.

13:27.474 --> 13:30.060
I became a federal agent
about two years ago.

13:31.853 --> 13:34.189
And Raymond knows this?

13:34.189 --> 13:35.899
There's nothing to worry about.

13:35.899 --> 13:37.359
Nothing to worry about?

13:37.359 --> 13:40.111
You're asking Tadashi to help the FBI!

13:40.111 --> 13:42.322
The FBI shouldn't even know his name!

13:42.489 --> 13:44.491
He's applying for business schools.

13:44.991 --> 13:47.911
Oh, my God.
All the things he's done for Raymond.

13:49.037 --> 13:51.873
You know about them?
Oh, my God.

13:51.873 --> 13:54.084
All the things Raymond has done for him!

13:54.084 --> 13:56.253
Ms. Ito, we have a situation,

13:56.253 --> 13:58.588
a situation involving Raymond,

13:58.588 --> 14:01.091
and I need Tadashi's help to help him.

14:01.633 --> 14:02.926
Please, Mother.

14:02.926 --> 14:04.219
Stop worrying.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.512
I can do what they're asking.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.055
Maybe.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.348
Probably.

14:09.266 --> 14:11.810
Look, we need to
move quickly. You have my word.

14:11.810 --> 14:14.312
I promise.
Nothing bad will happen to your son.

14:18.608 --> 14:21.653
Raymond usually pays in cash.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.618
Hey. You looking for me?

14:28.618 --> 14:30.412
How's it going with Reddington's tech guy?

14:30.412 --> 14:32.455
Good. Dembe just made a deal with his rep,

14:32.455 --> 14:34.457
who also happens to be his mother.

14:34.457 --> 14:35.917
The guy's barely 19.

14:35.917 --> 14:38.044
Nineteen and already as good as Aram?

14:38.044 --> 14:40.422
Well, I hope so,
because he needs to work fast.

14:40.422 --> 14:42.757
- Why? What's up?
- I just got off with Main Justice.

14:42.757 --> 14:45.093
That man from the Consulate
you spoke with in New York?

14:45.093 --> 14:46.845
He just filed a motion in District Court

14:46.845 --> 14:48.597
to preclude us from
searching Moores' laptop.

14:48.597 --> 14:50.432
At least we know
we're looking in the right place.

14:50.432 --> 14:52.851
Judge Vance wants all parties in Chambers
in half an hour.

14:52.851 --> 14:53.977
We drew Vance?

14:54.102 --> 14:55.645
- If we lose--
- No, we can't lose.

14:55.645 --> 14:57.731
I think Reddington took out
Jennifer Moores, and right now

14:57.731 --> 15:00.358
that laptop's the only lead
we have to tell us why.

15:00.358 --> 15:03.069
I'll do my best, but on the merits,
this could go either way.

15:03.069 --> 15:06.114
Let's just hope the kid cracks it
before we get shut down.

15:12.203 --> 15:14.497
Tadashi, I don't mean to add any pressure,

15:14.497 --> 15:16.291
but it's possible
we're running out of time.

15:16.291 --> 15:17.500
The drive's a disaster!

15:17.500 --> 15:19.336
Any worse,
and this would've been impossible.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.087
Does that mean you can read it?

15:21.087 --> 15:22.839
It's not just the damage
from the explosion,

15:22.839 --> 15:24.132
it's heat from the fire.

15:24.132 --> 15:26.009
Expose a drive to over 300 Celsius,

15:26.009 --> 15:28.345
and you get damage
to the platters and the ROM chip.

15:28.345 --> 15:30.639
Add to that the water damage
from the sprinklers

15:30.639 --> 15:32.682
and the Fire Department
hosing down the building?

15:32.682 --> 15:34.726
You get oxidation
and a warped drive chassis!

15:34.726 --> 15:36.061
Can you read them?

15:36.061 --> 15:39.022
No, but I'm close,
so stop stressing me out.

15:39.022 --> 15:41.149
Dude. Go hang with my mom.

15:44.903 --> 15:46.404
All right. Why don't we get started?

15:46.404 --> 15:48.406
Wendy Flynn for the United States.

15:48.406 --> 15:50.742
I'm here with Assistant Director
Harold Cooper of the FBI.

15:50.742 --> 15:52.035
Good afternoon, Your Honor.

15:52.035 --> 15:54.162
Don't be so sure, Director Cooper.

15:54.162 --> 15:56.081
I read Mr. Chin's motion.
This may not be

15:56.081 --> 15:58.166
a "good afternoon"
for the Bureau after all.

15:58.166 --> 15:59.793
Thank you, Your Honor.

15:59.793 --> 16:02.379
For the record, Chin Yao,
on behalf of the Consulate.

16:02.379 --> 16:04.047
- I'm listening.
- Your Honor,

16:04.047 --> 16:06.299
this matter falls squarely
within the provisions

16:06.299 --> 16:09.135
of the Vienna Convention
on Consular Relations,

16:09.135 --> 16:12.597
a treaty to which
182 nation states are party,

16:12.597 --> 16:14.808
including the United States and China.

16:14.808 --> 16:17.727
As you know, the principle
of property inviolability

16:17.727 --> 16:19.771
is well established and requires

16:19.771 --> 16:21.773
that the consular state consent

16:21.773 --> 16:24.693
to any entry by the receiving authority.

16:24.693 --> 16:26.152
Not any entry, Mr. Chin.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.321
They're allowed to enter
for an emergency

16:28.321 --> 16:30.907
requiring prompt protective action.

16:30.907 --> 16:33.159
I'm gonna guess that you're not
upset about the Fire Department

16:33.159 --> 16:34.536
risking their lives

16:34.536 --> 16:37.831
to protect your staff
and your precious annex?

16:37.831 --> 16:40.333
No, and we're grateful
for their assistance.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.502
But the FBI is another matter.

16:42.502 --> 16:43.962
Your Honor, if I could be heard--

16:43.962 --> 16:45.255
No. Him.

16:45.672 --> 16:48.508
Director Cooper, these were your agents

16:48.508 --> 16:51.511
acting as part of a task force
that you oversee?

16:51.511 --> 16:53.179
That's right, Your Honor.

16:53.179 --> 16:56.516
And those agents were told,
in clear and unambiguous terms,

16:56.516 --> 16:58.893
that their entry was not authorized?

16:58.893 --> 17:00.729
- Yes.
- And they proceeded anyway.

17:00.729 --> 17:02.522
And not only did they enter,

17:02.522 --> 17:05.483
- they removed the laptop in question.
- They seized evidence.

17:05.483 --> 17:07.736
- Which they had no right to do.
- Let him talk.

17:07.736 --> 17:11.239
I'd refer Your Honor
to Article 55 of the VCCR.

17:11.239 --> 17:13.241
Anyone enjoying consular privileges
has a duty

17:13.241 --> 17:16.035
to respect the laws
of the receiving state.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.829
Consular premises can't be used in a way

17:17.829 --> 17:19.914
that's incompatible
with consular functions.

17:19.914 --> 17:21.666
And this was? Incompatible?

17:21.666 --> 17:24.085
Absolutely. The woman killed
at this "annex"

17:24.085 --> 17:26.212
was a career criminal on parole.

17:26.212 --> 17:28.715
An American with no official
consular mission.

17:28.715 --> 17:31.634
Bottom line, we believe she was there
in furtherance of a crime.

17:31.634 --> 17:33.762
You believe, but your agents had nothing

17:33.762 --> 17:35.680
to even suggest as much at the time.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.891
If Mr. Chin were operating
a drug lab on the premises,

17:37.891 --> 17:39.893
we'd have a right to seize the drugs.

17:39.893 --> 17:42.312
But this wasn't a drug lab,
Director Cooper.

17:42.729 --> 17:45.064
Drugs are contraband on their face.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.108
Your agents were investigating a crime,

17:47.108 --> 17:48.526
not seizing proof of one.

17:48.526 --> 17:50.153
I'll ask Mr. Chin point blank.

17:50.153 --> 17:52.489
Why was Jennifer Moores
inside that building?

17:52.489 --> 17:54.783
What was her legitimate purpose
for being there?

17:54.783 --> 17:57.285
And I'm telling
Director Cooper point blank,

17:57.285 --> 17:59.913
I do not have to answer your questions.

18:02.957 --> 18:05.460
Yes, yes, yes! I'm in.

18:05.460 --> 18:07.629
Looks like there were

18:07.629 --> 18:10.548
five active files in use
when the drive was disabled.

18:10.548 --> 18:11.674
Can you access them?

18:11.674 --> 18:13.635
Not all of them. Three so far.

18:13.802 --> 18:15.220
But I should be able to get the other two.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.765
We're close.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.600
Close, but no cigar. It's over.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.519
Vance just ordered us to stop any search

18:22.519 --> 18:24.229
<i>and return the laptop.</i>

18:25.438 --> 18:27.732
Tadashi, we have to stop.

18:27.732 --> 18:29.359
Stop? Now?

18:29.359 --> 18:31.528
I'm almost there.
I can get the other files.

18:31.528 --> 18:32.821
No, you can't.

18:32.821 --> 18:34.155
Tadashi!

18:35.365 --> 18:37.242
I know you're used to working for Raymond,

18:37.242 --> 18:38.660
but this is different.

18:39.244 --> 18:40.829
I'm an agent now, and we have rules.

18:47.710 --> 18:50.171
Okay, we may not have a full pictures,

18:50.338 --> 18:52.423
but the files we recovered
before Vance's orders

18:52.423 --> 18:54.676
tell us a lot about what was going on.

18:54.676 --> 18:58.805
Apparently, Jennifer Moores
was casing Luxe International.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.723
It's a private company that specializes

19:00.723 --> 19:02.433
in fine-art storage and logistics.

19:02.433 --> 19:03.852
According to their website,

19:03.852 --> 19:05.770
they "store and transport expensive

19:05.770 --> 19:08.147
and priceless works of art
for a global clientele."

19:08.147 --> 19:10.108
<i>They're headquartered
on Montserrat,</i>

19:10.108 --> 19:12.443
<i>a British overseas territory
in the Caribbean.</i>

19:12.443 --> 19:14.946
- So Moores was planning a heist?
- Definitely.

19:14.946 --> 19:16.406
Luxe operates as a Freeport,

19:16.406 --> 19:18.408
which means it's a tax haven
for the wealthy.

19:18.408 --> 19:20.535
The stuff in there is worth billions.

19:20.535 --> 19:22.412
<i>Of course,
nobody is supposed to know</i>

19:22.412 --> 19:24.873
<i>what's in there,
because the list isn't public.</i>

19:24.873 --> 19:27.834
But Jennifer Moores had one,

19:27.834 --> 19:30.587
and she was focused on
one item in particular,

19:30.587 --> 19:32.672
a sculpture called <i>The Night Owl.</i>

19:32.672 --> 19:35.425
By Picasso?
I'm no expert, but sculpture's

19:35.425 --> 19:37.594
not the first thing I think about
when I hear that name.

19:37.594 --> 19:40.305
He made over 1,000.
And a lot of owls.

19:40.305 --> 19:42.223
Some say he became obsessed over them

19:42.223 --> 19:44.434
after he found a wounded owl
in his studio.

19:44.434 --> 19:46.436
<i>"The Night Owl."</i>
Luxe just got the shipment.

19:46.436 --> 19:47.937
It was part of a woman's estate,

19:47.937 --> 19:49.647
and when she died, they put it in storage.

19:49.647 --> 19:51.024
Any idea what it's worth?

19:51.024 --> 19:52.525
The Met just sold a Picasso sculpture

19:52.525 --> 19:54.819
- for over $48 million.
- What are we saying?

19:54.819 --> 19:57.989
That the Chinese hired Moores,
a former Blacklister,

19:57.989 --> 20:00.033
to help them steal this <i>Night Owl?</i>

20:00.033 --> 20:01.868
Maybe Reddington wants it for himself.

20:01.868 --> 20:04.537
I mean, at this point,
we have three-fifths of the story.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.915
So we stay on it.
You two, get to Luxe.

20:06.915 --> 20:09.417
Make sure they know
they've been targeted.

20:18.301 --> 20:20.887
Richard Deever.
I'm head of security here at Luxe.

20:20.887 --> 20:23.389
This is one of my associates, Siya Malik.

20:23.389 --> 20:24.766
Thanks for agreeing to see us.

20:24.766 --> 20:26.601
Well, we're the ones saying thanks.

20:26.601 --> 20:28.603
Our clients trust us
with their most treasured possessions,

20:28.603 --> 20:31.105
so obviously
we take any credible threat seriously.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.274
In your call to corporate,
you said you think

20:33.274 --> 20:35.485
- we've been targeted?
- We know you were.

20:35.485 --> 20:37.820
By a career criminal and master thief.

20:37.820 --> 20:40.365
This specific person
is no longer a danger,

20:40.365 --> 20:42.241
but we don't know who else
she was working with.

20:42.241 --> 20:45.620
From what we can tell,
she was targeting a specific sculpture.

20:45.620 --> 20:47.997
A Picasso called <i>The Night Owl.</i>

20:47.997 --> 20:50.917
Which we understand
was recently delivered here.

20:50.917 --> 20:53.586
It was, but that information
was never made public.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.296
Obviously, we keep the content

20:55.296 --> 20:57.423
of all our shipments
strictly confidential.

20:57.423 --> 21:00.635
<i>The Night Owl's</i> not one of
Picasso's better-known works.

21:00.635 --> 21:03.179
The fact that it even exists
was a closely guarded secret.

21:03.179 --> 21:04.555
Can I ask where you got this?

21:04.555 --> 21:06.099
I'm sorry. I can't disclose that.

21:06.099 --> 21:08.142
It's part of an ongoing
federal investigation.

21:08.142 --> 21:11.187
We can't protect ourselves
if we don't understand what--

21:11.187 --> 21:13.398
Fine. Then I'd like to speak
to the agent in charge.

21:13.398 --> 21:15.233
That "agent" is Harold Cooper,

21:15.233 --> 21:17.110
the Assistant Director of the FBI.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.989
You... You work for Harold Cooper?

21:20.989 --> 21:22.407
That's right.

21:22.657 --> 21:25.159
Harold Cooper runs a secret task force.

21:25.159 --> 21:28.371
So secret, most FBI agents
don't know about it.

21:28.371 --> 21:29.914
And you do?

21:29.914 --> 21:33.209
Yes, because my mother
used to work for Harold Cooper.

21:33.501 --> 21:35.294
Her name was Meera Malik.

21:38.214 --> 21:39.674
You're Meera's daughter?

21:39.674 --> 21:41.050
You knew her?

21:41.259 --> 21:42.552
We not only knew her.

21:42.552 --> 21:45.638
She was a friend.
And a-a very fine agent.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.310
Perhaps you could give us a minute.

22:00.737 --> 22:02.655
If we can verify what we just heard,

22:02.655 --> 22:04.949
I think we should show them around.

22:04.949 --> 22:07.827
Bad idea.
We can handle this ourselves.

22:07.827 --> 22:10.329
Thank them for the intel and let them go.

22:14.417 --> 22:16.836
Hmm. Let me guess.
Your boss says thanks for the tip,

22:16.836 --> 22:19.088
but, uh, you should give us the brush.

22:19.088 --> 22:21.132
A guy with Harold Cooper's connections

22:21.132 --> 22:23.342
could change that with one phone call.

22:23.342 --> 22:26.137
One "inter-agency" phone call.

22:37.273 --> 22:39.400
You two don't take no for an answer.

22:39.400 --> 22:41.611
Apparently, your boss made a phone call.

22:41.736 --> 22:43.321
Follow us, please.

23:04.008 --> 23:06.677
As you may have guessed,
this facility is a front.

23:06.677 --> 23:08.554
It functions as a black site.

23:08.554 --> 23:10.014
- International?
- Yes.

23:10.014 --> 23:12.100
Used by a number of allied agencies.

23:12.100 --> 23:14.769
High-end art storage is a strong cover.

23:14.769 --> 23:18.064
It explains the heavy security,
shipments coming in and out,

23:18.064 --> 23:20.191
and all interactions with the public

23:20.191 --> 23:22.360
are by appointment only.

23:22.360 --> 23:23.861
I'm with the Agency.

23:23.861 --> 23:26.656
Most of the other operatives on site
are also CIA.

23:26.656 --> 23:28.199
Agent Malik is with MI6.

23:31.828 --> 23:33.788
You were right. We did just receive

23:33.788 --> 23:36.290
<i>The Night Owl,</i> but it's not a sculpture.

23:36.290 --> 23:39.127
It's a code name for a prisoner
we recently transported.

23:39.127 --> 23:41.254
We brought him here to be interrogated.

23:41.254 --> 23:44.423
It would seem that somehow
your thief found out.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.801
- His name is Al--
- Alban Veseli.

23:46.801 --> 23:47.969
You know him?

23:47.969 --> 23:49.679
We call him The Freelancer.

23:58.229 --> 23:59.939
This just isn't gonna work.

23:59.939 --> 24:02.942
I mean,
all of this would have to come out.

24:02.942 --> 24:06.612
It's ridiculous.
It looks like a cruise ship.

24:06.612 --> 24:08.656
Like, what's this? A balcony?

24:08.656 --> 24:11.117
Yes, it's a balcony
on the mezzanine level.

24:11.117 --> 24:13.327
Is that where the water slide
and the wave pool are?

24:13.327 --> 24:14.871
On the mezzanine level?

24:14.871 --> 24:18.082
Mr. Reddington,
this place checks a lot of your boxes.

24:18.082 --> 24:21.460
Thirty thousand square feet,
no windows, high ceilings.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.379
I don't need high ceilings, Andrea.

24:23.379 --> 24:27.216
I need at least two stories,
not just a mezzanine.

24:27.216 --> 24:28.843
They do fully catered events,

24:28.843 --> 24:30.303
which means it has a working kitchen.

24:30.303 --> 24:32.471
- I know you didn't request that--
- You're right. I didn't.

24:32.471 --> 24:34.974
A kitchen is nice, but I don't need it.

24:35.099 --> 24:36.726
You need to work with me here.

24:37.226 --> 24:39.312
Two or more stories
means stairs, elevators.

24:39.312 --> 24:42.398
This is more efficient.
And it's a beautiful kitchen.

24:42.398 --> 24:44.275
Oh,
stop with the kitchen already.

24:44.275 --> 24:46.444
There's nothing I love more
than a great kitchen.

24:46.444 --> 24:48.154
We could get in your car right now

24:48.154 --> 24:51.866
and I could take you to any number
of fabulous kitchens

24:51.866 --> 24:53.868
and cook you a gorgeous meal.

24:53.868 --> 24:56.996
A lovely roast chicken, a duck breast.

24:56.996 --> 25:00.791
But for our purposes here,
what I'm looking for...

25:00.791 --> 25:03.127
I don't need a kitchen.

25:03.127 --> 25:05.630
And this has been open to the public.

25:05.630 --> 25:09.175
The place I need has to be discreet.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.636
I need it to be invisible.

25:11.761 --> 25:13.387
That doesn't exist.

25:13.387 --> 25:14.805
You mean you haven't found it yet.

25:14.805 --> 25:16.849
No, I mean it doesn't exist!

25:16.849 --> 25:19.852
A vacant space that large in this area?

25:19.852 --> 25:22.730
Remember, I can only show you
what's available.

25:22.730 --> 25:25.733
Okay, well, don't take this
the wrong way, Andrea,

25:25.733 --> 25:28.861
but that's the first
helpful thing you've said.

25:28.861 --> 25:30.529
So it does exist.

25:30.529 --> 25:33.032
It's just being used by somebody else.

25:33.032 --> 25:35.117
Maybe. Yes.

25:36.494 --> 25:38.704
Are you saying you want
to buy someone out?

25:38.704 --> 25:43.167
How about I buy you lunch
and you tell me everything you know

25:43.167 --> 25:47.129
about the companies
that have factories in the area?

25:47.129 --> 25:50.549
About two years ago,
a natural-gas pipeline ruptured

25:50.549 --> 25:52.885
just outside the town of Glennshire,

25:52.885 --> 25:54.720
eighty miles north of London.

25:55.304 --> 25:58.891
The blast leveled four blocks
and killed 17 people.

25:58.891 --> 26:01.394
You're talking about the blast
that killed Randall Ames.

26:01.394 --> 26:03.145
Yes, a member of Parliament

26:03.145 --> 26:05.731
and the UK's Anti-Corruption Champion.

26:05.731 --> 26:08.317
He was on holiday
in Glennshire with his wife.

26:08.317 --> 26:10.611
At first,
we thought it was just a tragic accident,

26:10.611 --> 26:12.530
but a closer look made us believe

26:12.530 --> 26:14.407
the pipeline was sabotaged.

26:14.407 --> 26:17.034
A mass accident designed
to cover up a single murder.

26:17.034 --> 26:18.911
We're familiar with the M.O.

26:18.911 --> 26:21.747
Veseli was briefly out of prison
around that time.

26:21.747 --> 26:23.457
That's when Keen got him released.

26:23.708 --> 26:25.209
MI6 made a request,

26:25.209 --> 26:27.295
and the Agency brought him here
for questioning.

26:27.712 --> 26:30.006
But to be honest,
we haven't had much luck.

26:30.006 --> 26:31.799
He hasn't said a word.

26:32.466 --> 26:34.802
- He'll talk to us.
- And why would he do that?

26:34.802 --> 26:37.430
Let's just say, uh, we have a history.

26:48.607 --> 26:51.694
I swear.
Now I've seen everything.

26:51.861 --> 26:55.656
You're telling me
the FBI gave you a badge?

26:55.656 --> 26:57.533
Things change, Alban.

26:57.533 --> 27:00.911
Although, you seem like
the exact same man you always were.

27:00.911 --> 27:03.873
I should've known
that pipeline in Glennshire was you.

27:05.207 --> 27:07.918
A little work I took on the side.

27:07.918 --> 27:09.754
Agent Keen had no idea.

27:11.088 --> 27:13.966
I was, uh...
I was sad to hear about her passing.

27:13.966 --> 27:15.509
Watch what you say about Keen.

27:15.509 --> 27:17.303
What am I supposed to say?

27:17.303 --> 27:19.764
She set me up, just like Reddington.

27:20.890 --> 27:24.560
Got me out of prison,
sent me to crash a plane,

27:24.560 --> 27:28.481
then warned the FBI so that
the Bureau could re-arrest me.

27:28.481 --> 27:31.150
Well, we'll have to walk down
memory lane another time.

27:31.150 --> 27:33.110
I want to know about
Jennifer Anne Moores.

27:33.110 --> 27:35.738
Wow.
Didn't see that coming.

27:35.738 --> 27:38.282
Mostly because
I have no idea who that is.

27:38.282 --> 27:40.618
She was working on a plan
to set you free.

27:40.618 --> 27:42.495
Oh, I like her already.

27:42.495 --> 27:44.872
What's your connection
to the Chinese Consulate?

27:46.749 --> 27:49.835
Fellas. I'm willing to play.

27:49.835 --> 27:53.130
But it would help if I at least
knew the game.

27:53.589 --> 27:56.175
We're supposed to believe that you don't?

27:56.175 --> 27:58.177
Jennifer Moores
was tracking your movements,

27:58.177 --> 28:00.346
casing the black site
where you were being sent,

28:00.346 --> 28:02.848
and you're telling us that
you knew nothing about that?

28:17.780 --> 28:19.240
Lock it down.

28:20.616 --> 28:21.784
Stop!

28:29.375 --> 28:30.793
You were right.

28:32.044 --> 28:34.505
Maybe that was the FBI outside.

28:34.505 --> 28:37.758
In fact, maybe they're not just outside.

28:37.758 --> 28:41.095
Maybe they're right here in this room.

28:43.305 --> 28:46.392
Think hard before you
accuse anybody of anything.

28:47.101 --> 28:48.519
<i>Wujing.</i>

28:49.645 --> 28:52.231
Wujing. Two minutes out.

28:52.356 --> 28:54.275
Tell our people to proceed.

28:55.192 --> 28:56.610
Clear to proceed.

28:57.570 --> 28:59.447
I think you'll be pleased.

29:08.164 --> 29:10.374
Did you hear that?

29:10.374 --> 29:13.252
Automatic rifle.
Hundred bucks it's an M-16.

29:13.252 --> 29:14.628
We have to get him out of here.

29:14.628 --> 29:16.547
Watch your back! Code four!

29:28.684 --> 29:31.937
Alban Veseli is somewhere
in this building. Find him.

29:35.441 --> 29:37.067
- We have to go.
- Go?

29:37.234 --> 29:39.153
We have full security on site,
with military training.

29:39.153 --> 29:40.946
Well, whoever's coming knows that.

29:40.946 --> 29:42.656
They wouldn't have attacked
the building unless they knew

29:42.656 --> 29:45.034
that they had the manpower
to overrun your security.

29:45.034 --> 29:47.578
Overrun? You mean kill everyone
in the building?

29:47.578 --> 29:49.622
They want him,
and they won't leave without him.

29:49.622 --> 29:51.499
There must be another way out of here.

29:51.499 --> 29:53.375
Yes. Motor pool.
We have cars stationed there,

29:53.375 --> 29:55.211
but on the other side of the building.

29:55.211 --> 29:56.587
Get Veseli ready to move.

29:56.587 --> 29:58.631
We have to assume
they know where to look,

29:58.631 --> 30:00.883
and we need to be gone
when they get here.

30:13.687 --> 30:14.813
Agent Ressler?

30:14.813 --> 30:16.941
Cooper, we're under attack.
We're taking heavy fire.

30:16.941 --> 30:18.901
How's that possible?
You're at an Agency black site.

30:18.901 --> 30:21.028
It was Alban Veseli. "The Night Owl"?

30:21.028 --> 30:23.113
The heist Jennifer Moores was planning,

30:23.113 --> 30:24.949
it was a rescue op to recover Veseli.

30:24.949 --> 30:26.158
Can you get out?

30:26.158 --> 30:28.410
There's a motor pool.

30:28.410 --> 30:31.247
If we can make it there,
maybe we can still get out!

30:31.247 --> 30:33.082
So it's Veseli's people behind the attack?

30:33.082 --> 30:34.875
Look, whoever you called, call them back!

30:34.875 --> 30:37.795
Tel them their teams on the ground
need reinforcements now!

30:40.756 --> 30:42.258
They're too close!

30:42.258 --> 30:44.301
We'll try to keep them back!
You two keep going!

30:48.264 --> 30:50.683
- Get him out of here!
- We can't just leave you!

30:50.683 --> 30:53.185
Nobody's leaving anybody.
We'll be right behind you.

30:53.185 --> 30:55.145
A tad optimistic.
I want a hug goodbye.

30:55.145 --> 30:56.981
- Go! Move!
- Go, go!

30:56.981 --> 30:58.732
What are the chances of backup?

30:58.732 --> 31:01.860
Getting here on time? Slim to none!

31:05.489 --> 31:08.033
We're at a covert black site
on a Caribbean island.

31:08.242 --> 31:10.452
- Then how do they know?
- What do you mean?

31:10.452 --> 31:12.997
Whoever's doing this,
how did they get that intel?

31:17.209 --> 31:18.460
There!

31:19.712 --> 31:21.130
We gotta get out of here!

31:21.130 --> 31:24.717
Something's wrong.
They have too much info.

31:24.717 --> 31:26.552
We gotta make a run for it! Come on!

31:26.552 --> 31:28.971
Maybe they figured out
where Veseli was being taken,

31:28.971 --> 31:30.764
but how did they know the code name?

31:30.764 --> 31:32.683
And where'd they get the list of the art?

31:32.683 --> 31:34.893
It was someone on the inside.

31:36.395 --> 31:39.023
Sorry, Malik. I'll take it from here.

31:39.023 --> 31:40.399
Richard?

31:40.399 --> 31:43.527
I know. I didn't see it coming myself.

31:43.527 --> 31:47.156
I'm a cliche.
A spy who turned for the money.

31:47.156 --> 31:50.159
All I can tell you is
it is a whole lot of money.

31:50.159 --> 31:51.910
I can't let you take him.

31:52.494 --> 31:54.955
- Good for you.
- Drop the gun, Siya.

31:54.955 --> 31:57.249
Believe me,
this guy is not worth dying for.

31:58.667 --> 31:59.710
Drop it.

32:06.175 --> 32:08.636
Go! Go! Come on!

32:11.972 --> 32:13.098
Go!

32:14.516 --> 32:15.726
Go!

32:40.417 --> 32:42.086
Wujing's here! We gotta go now!

32:42.086 --> 32:44.630
It was Deever.
She was hit, but she's wearing a vest.

33:06.110 --> 33:08.737
Okay. Thank you.

33:08.737 --> 33:11.281
Nothing yet.

33:11.281 --> 33:14.660
We issued a BOLO on all three,
Wujing, Veseli, and Deever.

33:14.660 --> 33:16.745
But they could be anywhere
in the world by now.

33:16.745 --> 33:18.330
What about flights off the island?

33:18.330 --> 33:20.082
Three private flights left Montserrat

33:20.082 --> 33:21.709
within an hour of the attack.

33:21.709 --> 33:23.752
We're checking manifests,
but Wujing knows better

33:23.752 --> 33:25.170
than to leave a paper trail.

33:25.170 --> 33:27.423
So Meera's daughter became an MI6 agent?

33:27.423 --> 33:29.550
- Her name is Siya.
- I met her once.

33:29.550 --> 33:31.677
After Meera was killed, I flew to London

33:31.677 --> 33:33.679
to pay my respects to her family.

33:33.804 --> 33:35.347
She couldn't have been older than 15.

33:35.973 --> 33:37.057
That trip was one of the hardest things

33:37.057 --> 33:38.934
I've ever had to do in this job.

33:38.934 --> 33:41.729
I couldn't tell her husband
and kids anything.

33:41.729 --> 33:43.355
Well, she asked to see you.

33:43.355 --> 33:45.816
- She insisted on flying back with us.
- I'd like that.

33:45.816 --> 33:47.609
That bullet banged her up pretty good,

33:47.609 --> 33:49.486
so we took her over to DC General first,

33:49.486 --> 33:51.363
just to make sure she's okay.

33:51.363 --> 33:53.240
There's a lot of names from the past.

33:53.240 --> 33:56.201
Jennifer Moores, Alban Veseli,
and now Wujing.

34:01.415 --> 34:03.125
The ministry has a plane waiting.

34:03.125 --> 34:05.377
We'll be in Beijing this time tomorrow.

34:05.377 --> 34:07.671
Oh, we're not going home.

34:08.797 --> 34:11.383
Not until I find and kill
Raymond Reddington.

34:11.383 --> 34:14.094
Reddington?
Wujing, we can't do that alone.

34:14.094 --> 34:16.096
We won't have to.

34:16.096 --> 34:19.725
I have a list of others
who will be glad to join the fight.

34:21.310 --> 34:23.729
That's three former Blacklisters
connected to this case.

34:23.729 --> 34:25.564
We were notified when Wujing escaped.

34:25.564 --> 34:27.149
The Bureau's got a dozen agents on it,

34:27.149 --> 34:28.650
but they never picked up a trail.

34:28.650 --> 34:31.737
Apparently, he was working with Moores
to break Veseli out of custody.

34:31.737 --> 34:35.491
Why? Wujing is an assassin.
What's the connection?

34:38.744 --> 34:40.913
You've got to be kidding.

34:40.913 --> 34:42.498
Guess who just cleared security.

34:42.498 --> 34:43.832
Hmm. Reddington.

34:43.832 --> 34:45.542
He's on his way down.

34:50.047 --> 34:54.259
Ah. [chuckles] The gang's all here.

34:54.259 --> 34:58.680
Well, not much of the gang.
More of a coffee klatch.

34:58.680 --> 35:01.266
Raymond, we've been trying to reach you.

35:01.266 --> 35:04.895
Yes? Well, apologies.

35:04.895 --> 35:07.356
I've been busier than expected.

35:07.356 --> 35:10.025
Busy? As in blowing up
former Blacklisters

35:10.025 --> 35:11.610
at foreign consulates?

35:11.610 --> 35:14.154
No, Donald.
That didn't take much time at all.

35:14.822 --> 35:17.074
But if you know about Jennifer Moores,

35:17.074 --> 35:20.953
then you know
a serious threat has arisen.

35:20.953 --> 35:23.914
I didn't reach out, Harold,
because I thought...

35:23.914 --> 35:26.708
I hoped that I could contain
the matter myself,

35:26.708 --> 35:30.254
but now, unfortunately,
that seems unlikely.

35:30.254 --> 35:32.297
You're talking about Wujing.
He's the threat.

35:32.297 --> 35:35.300
Wujing is the weapon
fired in my direction

35:35.300 --> 35:40.222
as a last parting shot
by Marvin Gerard.

35:40.222 --> 35:41.849
Marvin's behind this?

35:41.849 --> 35:43.725
They could have met at Coolidge.

35:43.725 --> 35:45.811
They were both housed
on the same cellblock.

35:45.811 --> 35:48.772
I'm aware, but Wujing's escape happened
after Marvin's death.

35:48.772 --> 35:50.274
I didn't make the connection.

35:50.274 --> 35:53.485
Wujing's been asking questions about me,

35:53.485 --> 35:56.238
about any relationship with the FBI.

35:56.238 --> 35:57.990
Marvin must have told him.

35:57.990 --> 36:00.158
So Wujing knows about the task force.

36:00.993 --> 36:04.621
Raymond is not your friend.
He's the reason you're in here.

36:04.621 --> 36:06.290
What do you mean?

36:06.665 --> 36:08.959
He's a confidential informant.

36:09.793 --> 36:12.004
He has an immunity deal with the Feds.

36:12.004 --> 36:14.548
He feeds them criminals like you,

36:14.548 --> 36:16.550
and he keeps his freedom.

36:18.927 --> 36:21.430
He knows whatever Marvin told him,

36:21.430 --> 36:24.308
but, still, that isn't the same
as having proof, so...

36:24.308 --> 36:26.351
He doesn't
just want to kill you.

36:26.351 --> 36:28.437
He wants the criminal world
to know about us.

36:28.437 --> 36:29.938
Jennifer Moores. Veseli.

36:29.938 --> 36:33.483
Wujing's approaching Blacklisters,
criminals we sent to jail.

36:33.483 --> 36:36.904
Some of our former targets
are now his targets.

36:36.904 --> 36:39.740
You should increase their security.

36:39.740 --> 36:41.116
Because...

36:42.409 --> 36:44.620
This is only the beginning.

36:49.958 --> 36:52.544
Well,
that's all I have for you.

36:58.175 --> 36:59.384
Raymond.

37:00.177 --> 37:01.470
Where's Chuck?

37:02.304 --> 37:03.513
I don't know.

37:03.513 --> 37:05.307
Who's in charge of your security?

37:05.307 --> 37:06.725
Weecha's not with you?

37:08.268 --> 37:10.354
- No.
- Where are you living?

37:10.354 --> 37:11.772
New York, mostly.

37:11.772 --> 37:13.065
How did you get here?

37:13.065 --> 37:14.441
Took the train.

37:14.441 --> 37:16.234
What a nap. Slept the whole way.

37:16.234 --> 37:18.403
Where are you going?
Is there a car waiting for you?

37:18.403 --> 37:20.822
Dembe, I'm fine.
I'll just grab a cab.

37:20.822 --> 37:22.157
Raymond.

37:23.158 --> 37:24.952
What's going on?

37:24.952 --> 37:26.787
Nothing.

37:26.787 --> 37:30.457
Well, nothing and everything.

37:30.457 --> 37:32.084
Watch your head.

37:40.384 --> 37:42.386
- She's here.
- Great.

37:43.595 --> 37:46.056
Siya. Please, come in.

37:46.056 --> 37:49.142
Blindfold. Black-out van.

37:49.142 --> 37:51.937
You guys have more security protocols
than the White House.

37:51.937 --> 37:53.939
We've had some issues.

37:53.939 --> 37:56.274
We're being more careful these days.

37:56.274 --> 37:58.318
- Harold Cooper.
- Siya Malik.

37:59.569 --> 38:01.196
It's been a while.

38:01.196 --> 38:02.614
It has.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.866
Sorry for that.
I wish we'd kept in touch.

38:04.866 --> 38:06.201
It's nice to see you.

38:06.201 --> 38:07.619
You know, even all these years later,

38:07.619 --> 38:09.579
I sometimes think of the day we met.

38:09.579 --> 38:11.081
So do I.

38:11.081 --> 38:13.625
But I'm guessing
we remember it differently.

38:13.625 --> 38:15.961
- How do you mean?
- You may not realize it,

38:15.961 --> 38:19.506
but you made a big impression
on the teenage me.

38:19.506 --> 38:21.550
I've always been incredibly grateful

38:21.550 --> 38:24.511
for how you spoke to us that day.

38:24.511 --> 38:27.848
You couldn't tell us anything,
but we knew.

38:29.725 --> 38:32.561
That was as hard for you to say
as it was for us to hear.

38:33.603 --> 38:37.107
You became an agent.
I had no idea.

38:37.107 --> 38:38.567
And MI6.

38:38.567 --> 38:40.318
You're not just an agent.
You're a spy.

38:40.318 --> 38:42.654
- You sound surprised.
- I'm thinking about your father.

38:42.654 --> 38:44.322
He must be the one who was surprised.

38:44.322 --> 38:47.868
And terrified.
But he's coming around.

38:47.868 --> 38:49.411
I don't make a practice

38:49.411 --> 38:52.164
of talking with him about my day-to-day.

38:52.164 --> 38:54.541
What made you choose this kind of life?

38:54.541 --> 38:57.169
Just too many secrets.

38:58.587 --> 39:01.381
When my mother died, you couldn't tell me

39:01.381 --> 39:03.800
who she worked with, what she did,

39:03.800 --> 39:06.344
or even how she was killed.

39:08.055 --> 39:09.890
I think I decided right then and there,

39:09.890 --> 39:13.518
I'd do whatever it took to get in the room
where the secrets are revealed.

39:13.518 --> 39:14.978
And you've done it.

39:14.978 --> 39:17.731
Well, not completely.
That's why I'm here.

39:17.731 --> 39:20.609
Maybe it wasn't an accident,
us crossing paths like this.

39:21.485 --> 39:22.736
It wasn't?

39:23.945 --> 39:26.448
Maybe it's time for me
to finally know more

39:26.448 --> 39:28.200
about the work my mother did.

39:28.200 --> 39:29.868
If it was that important,

39:29.868 --> 39:32.871
maybe it's time for me to
continue what she started.

39:32.871 --> 39:34.498
Siya, that's complicated.

39:34.498 --> 39:37.125
Please, just hear me out.
I'm involved now, yeah?

39:37.125 --> 39:40.629
I lost colleagues and friends
in that attack.

39:40.962 --> 39:44.549
And Deever? I will find him.

39:44.549 --> 39:46.093
The secrets you spoke of

39:46.093 --> 39:48.553
are only shared with members
of this task force.

39:48.553 --> 39:51.348
I'm in the same position now
as I was back then.

39:51.348 --> 39:54.768
You are, but I'm not.
I can talk to my superiors at SIS.

39:54.768 --> 39:56.728
They could loan me to your task force,

39:56.728 --> 39:58.855
just until this case is done.

40:00.982 --> 40:02.818
Let me think about it.

40:07.364 --> 40:10.575
I don't know what this place is,
but something tells me

40:10.575 --> 40:13.620
it only exists for the people
who work here.

40:13.954 --> 40:15.372
I'll be in touch.

40:21.211 --> 40:22.838
I hope so.

40:22.838 --> 40:25.048
You need agents you can trust.

40:26.299 --> 40:27.968
I'm one.

40:51.199 --> 40:53.827
Mr. Deever.
You have lived up to your word.

40:53.827 --> 40:55.620
If you give us a moment,

40:55.620 --> 40:57.747
my associate will transfer your money

40:57.747 --> 40:59.708
and discuss your next assignment.

41:06.089 --> 41:08.425
Do I know you, friend?

41:08.425 --> 41:10.594
My name is Wujing.

41:10.594 --> 41:12.429
We're not friends, Mr. Veseli.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.765
But we do have a common enemy.
