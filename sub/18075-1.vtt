- We must hurry.
- Get out of here, Manny.
He doesn't know about you.

03:37.160 --> 03:41.040
He'll find out. These people
are frightened. They'll tell him.

03:41.120 --> 03:45.040
I am not taking you with me, kiddo.
I got this story. I'm gonna write it.

<i>We talk, Mr Massey.</i>

- He's not on vacation!
- Who the hell cares?
He's on vacation. He's not.

05:46.120 --> 05:48.600
Last year we sent him to cover
the French elections.

<i>He ends up lushed out of his gourd</i>
<i>in Costa del Sol.</i>

05:54.080 --> 05:58.000
The paper eats 20 grand in expenses.
And Massey doesn't file a word.

05:58.080 --> 06:00.120
That is not the point.

06:00.200 --> 06:02.520
The point is that you're
all over the road, Allen. Look.

Mexican embassy complains
that you're threatening them. Look!

06:06.000 --> 06:08.440
Special requests from

06:08.560 --> 06:12.640
using this paper to stir up trouble with
the U.S. Senate and Mexican government.

06:12.720 --> 06:16.200
I was trying to find out
what happened to him.
They claim he never even entered Mexico.

06:16.280 --> 06:20.840
Damn it, Grant. Doesn't this rag
have a responsibility to protect
its reporters on assignment?

06:20.920 --> 06:24.080
Al Massey's been doing
wheels-up landings here for over a year.

06:24.160 --> 06:26.800
I'm tired of scraping him
off the front steps.

06:26.880 --> 06:29.680
His wife died.
He's been depressed.

<i>l"ve been carrying him,</i>
<i>but now l"m through.</i>

06:31.920 --> 06:36.400
He's gonna show up in a couple
of weeks down there at a bullfight
wearing a lampshade.

06:36.480 --> 06:40.520
I'm not gonna waste any more
of this paper's money on that lost cause.

06:40.600 --> 06:45.720
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna let you use
this paper's influence to rattle windows.

06:45.800 --> 06:47.760
<i>You got that?</i>

06:47.880 --> 06:49.760
He's my friend.

06:53.920 --> 06:57.480
Allen, you need some time off.

06:57.560 --> 07:02.320
<i>l"m suspending you at half pay</i>
<i>for two weeks. You"re a good reporter...</i>

07:02.400 --> 07:05.160
but you gotta find some way
to stop sitting on your brains.

07:05.200 --> 07:08.360
Turn over your feature stuff to Mark
and file your filler before you leave.

07:08.440 --> 07:10.200
Just like that.

07:13.520 --> 07:16.680
Honey, get out,
before I pull your plug all the way.

07:23.280 --> 07:26.040
All right!

07:27.120 --> 07:30.560
Somebody had to say it.
Are you all right?

07:35.800 --> 07:37.960
That was really great...

07:38.040 --> 07:41.960
you telling that fathead
about journalistic responsibility.

07:42.080 --> 07:45.960
Did you find Massey's research paper?
Did he file any copy at all?

07:46.040 --> 07:48.920
Nothing. I did take the liberty
of stopping by his house.

07:49.040 --> 07:52.280
I used to do a little second-storey work
when I was with the <i>Miami Herald.</i>

07:52.360 --> 07:54.520
I am a killer with louvered windows.

07:54.600 --> 07:58.680
Anyway, I went through his apartment
last night and pulled out this.

07:58.760 --> 08:03.160
- From under his mattress.
- San Rio Blanco?

08:03.240 --> 08:06.080
Is this all there is? A name...
Manny Cortez... and a phone number?

08:06.160 --> 08:11.320
Yep. I looked it up, and San Rio Blanco
is a little town in the hills above Acapulco.

08:13.520 --> 08:16.280
What about that other thing?
That commando team?

08:16.360 --> 08:18.720
Did you get anything more on that?

08:18.760 --> 08:21.920
- Zack, I'm talking to you.
- Look, kid, I told you, it is a rumour.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.440
Strictly a rumour.

08:24.520 --> 08:28.720
Mike Kelly tried to follow that story about
six months ago before he got sacked.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.840
He couldn't even prove
that they existed.

08:30.880 --> 08:34.400
There was a rumour that they broke
some senator's kid out of a Turkish prison.

08:34.480 --> 08:38.080
<i>Soldiers of fortune. Outriders</i>
<i>who would do anything anywhere.</i>

08:38.200 --> 08:41.240
- The A-Team. Isn't that
what he called them?
- Yeah. Yeah.

08:41.320 --> 08:43.520
- Let's go.
- Terrific.

08:44.400 --> 08:47.760
These guys knocked
over the Bank of Hanoi...

08:47.800 --> 08:51.360
four days after
the Vietnam War ended.

08:51.440 --> 08:57.200
They wandered out of the D.M.Z. with 100
million yen and got busted by the army.

08:57.320 --> 09:00.840
Nobody knew anything about the mission.
They claim they were under orders...

09:00.880 --> 09:03.680
from a Colonel, uh, Morrison...

09:03.760 --> 09:06.640
but Morrison took a round
in one of the last shellings.

09:06.720 --> 09:10.960
His headquarters burnt to the ground,
so no record of the mission was ever found.

09:11.040 --> 09:14.960
<i>There was a big stink.</i>
<i>And then right before the trial...</i>

09:15.080 --> 09:17.280
they went over the wall
and disappeared.

09:17.360 --> 09:20.040
- That was 10 years ago.
- And they're still wanted?

09:20.120 --> 09:22.920
Oh, yeah, yeah.
There's one guy in here...

09:24.400 --> 09:27.920
Here. A colonel named Lynch.

09:29.480 --> 09:31.400
He ran the prison at Fort Bragg.

09:31.480 --> 09:35.720
<i>He is still looking for them.</i>
<i>It is a vendetta for him.</i>

09:35.800 --> 09:40.080
Okay, Zack, I'm sufficiently intrigued.
Who are they?

09:40.160 --> 09:42.080
All right.

09:43.200 --> 09:47.960
The leader is a colonel named
John Smith.

09:48.040 --> 09:50.000
But everybody calls him Hannibal.

09:50.120 --> 09:53.320
The guy has a very unorthodox style.

09:53.360 --> 09:56.200
<i>Not bad. Who else?</i>

09:56.320 --> 09:58.800
Bosco Baracus.

09:58.880 --> 10:01.920
<i>Known as B.A. for "bad attitude."</i>

10:02.000 --> 10:04.600
The man is a mechanical genius.

10:04.680 --> 10:07.720
<i>He also has one of the worst</i>
<i>conduct records in the army.</i>

10:07.840 --> 10:10.760
He likes to slug officers.

10:16.560 --> 10:18.440

<i>Now this is more like it.</i>

10:18.520 --> 10:20.920
<i>Templeton Peck,</i>
<i>known as the Faceman.</i>

10:21.000 --> 10:24.600
In and out of trouble. An orphan from L.A.
This guy is Mr Ricky-Ticky.

10:24.680 --> 10:27.960
<i>A con man. A real operator.</i>
<i>And that"s the unit.</i>

10:29.720 --> 10:31.800
I wonder where they are now.

10:39.760 --> 10:42.120
Hannibal's gotta be
down there somewhere.

10:45.360 --> 10:49.520
- Let's go!
- <i>Cut! Who the hell is that?</i>

10:49.600 --> 10:52.160
Where'd that moron come from?

10:54.200 --> 10:57.400
Mike, don't we have an A.D.
to hold the traffic on that road?

10:57.520 --> 10:59.720
[Man] Sorry, Jerry. That's our screwup.
I'll get a guy up there.

10:59.800 --> 11:04.160
Come on! People, we're burning daylight
here. Let's stay together here, huh?

11:07.520 --> 11:09.720
[Panting]
Did you like the arms?

11:09.800 --> 11:13.400
Johnny, I want 30 seconds underwater.
Thirty seconds after "action."

11:13.520 --> 11:16.080
You're popping up like the rubber duck
in my kid's bathtub.

11:16.160 --> 11:19.120
I gotta stay down there two minutes
for the water to get still.

11:19.200 --> 11:23.600
- You want 30 seconds after that?
You gotta be nuts.
- Hey, pal, that's the job.

11:23.680 --> 11:27.120
The guy we had in <i>Aquamania 1</i>
stayed down four minutes.

11:27.200 --> 11:30.800
- Then why isn't he doing it now?
- He had a little brain haemorrhage
or something.

11:30.880 --> 11:32.920
I don't know.
Let's go. Come on.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
Let's get this sucker in the can.
Back in the drink, chickie. Same shot.

11:37.720 --> 11:40.640
I'm looking for John Smith!
John, where are ya?

11:40.720 --> 11:42.960
Hey, hey, it's me.

11:43.040 --> 11:46.640
Get back in the lake!
Come on. I'm on a tight clock here!

11:46.680 --> 11:50.480
Just give us a second here, fellas.
He's on us... Colonel Lynch.

11:50.560 --> 11:52.640
He hit B.A.'s pad two hours ago
with six M.P.s.

11:52.720 --> 11:55.720
- They're around my place like goonies
at a supermarket opening.
- How'd he trace us?

11:55.800 --> 11:58.280
Maybe the senator's kid talked.
Never thought he had his lights on.

11:58.360 --> 12:01.360
- If he burned us, he knows about me.
- You got it. We should disappear.

12:01.480 --> 12:03.800
I got one more shot and I'm through.
Now watch this.

12:03.960 --> 12:06.440
I think I got a real handle
on my character here.

12:06.520 --> 12:10.160
I'm playing mean
with a kind of a sad reluctance.

12:11.920 --> 12:15.880
Yeah? Well, you're about to get
a chance to play it for Colonel Lynch.

12:15.960 --> 12:18.480
That's him. John Hannibal Smith.

12:18.560 --> 12:20.320
Come on. Get him.
Go, go, go!

12:22.040 --> 12:25.640
- Give me my tail.
- Where are you going?

12:26.560 --> 12:29.760
- Waldorf-Astoria, driver. And step on it.
- Funny.

- I ain't stopping for no autographs.

13:22.720 --> 13:24.840
Take a right here.
We'll cut through Roman Street.

13:24.960 --> 13:28.640
I know this lot
like the back of my hand.

13:31.600 --> 13:34.560
Oh, no. They changed it.

Pull it and let's make tracks!

He's daring me.

15:14.320 --> 15:16.200
No, wait!

17:29.600 --> 17:33.600
Murdock, Lynch fell on us.
He may be heading your way.

17:33.680 --> 17:35.600
He may get real tough.

17:35.720 --> 17:38.800
Hannibal, I got company standing
in the hall right now.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.680
Who's there, Murdock?

17:40.760 --> 17:44.520
A girl reporter. She knows I flew you guys
in 'Nam. Got it from Pentagon records.

17:44.640 --> 17:49.400
- A reporter?
- Only she says she's got a job
for us in <i>México.</i>

17:49.520 --> 17:54.560
- Remember that friend of mine, that guy
who kept fading out, that Mexican guy?
- Be careful of the reporter.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.560
If she looks legit...

17:56.640 --> 17:59.920
send her to the alley behind
the Kozy Kat Klub at 2:00 a.m. tonight.

18:00.000 --> 18:04.400
- And watch out for Lynch.
- Don't worry about Colonel Geek.

18:04.520 --> 18:07.000
I'm gonna slam-dunk that sucker.

18:07.120 --> 18:12.280
And may the great spirit watch
over your refrigerator and keep it cold.
World without end.

18:12.360 --> 18:15.640
- Adios.
- I think he's getting worse.

18:15.760 --> 18:18.920
Sorry. My mother
was on the phone.

18:25.360 --> 18:27.200
Your mother?

18:27.280 --> 18:30.400
On the file I got on you,
it said she died when you were five.

18:30.480 --> 18:34.920
She did, but I had a line put in.
You know, what a hassle.

18:34.960 --> 18:37.000
<i>Telephone company,</i>
<i>they don"t cooperate.</i>

18:37.120 --> 18:39.560
Took a while,
but we're solid now.

18:39.640 --> 18:42.280
So you never heard of the A-Team
or any of these guys?

18:42.400 --> 18:45.000
Look. I got problems, you know.

18:54.160 --> 18:56.280
Mr Murdock, what are you doing?

18:56.360 --> 18:59.840
I'm shaving. Come on. Haven't you
ever seen a man shave in the morning?

19:01.760 --> 19:06.440
I'm sorry what happened to you.
Bye, Mr Murdock.

19:09.920 --> 19:12.480
The A-Team?

19:12.600 --> 19:15.520
Go to the alley behind
the Kozy Kat Klub...

19:15.600 --> 19:18.080
in Hollywood at 2:00 a.m.

19:18.160 --> 19:20.520

<i>I have a hunch this Murdock</i>
<i>character isn"t anywhere</i>
<i>near as crazy as he pretends.</i>

19:35.160 --> 19:39.040
He's not faking. Mr Murdock has
paranoid anxiety delusions and
intermittent memory loss.

19:39.120 --> 19:41.560
Be that as it may, I'm gonna
press him hard and see what happens.

19:41.680 --> 19:44.760
- That won't snap him, will it?
- No. He's usually a lot of fun.

19:44.840 --> 19:49.720
However, if he starts talking
about ammonia, that's a clue
he may become violent.

19:52.640 --> 19:54.680
- Violent?
- <i>Hardly ever happens.</i>

19:54.800 --> 19:57.760
But watch out. It's a trigger word
for his aggressive cycle.

19:57.840 --> 20:00.440
Ammonia?

20:03.680 --> 20:06.760
<i>Where"s my dog Billy?</i>
<i>You seen my dog?</i>

20:06.800 --> 20:10.600
What you doing, man? Step off!
Step off! Did you bring any candy?

20:10.680 --> 20:13.320
- Mr Murdock, get down from there.
- From where?

20:13.440 --> 20:15.720
<i>- Off the cabinet.</i>
<i>- Don"t worry about it, Nurse.</i>

20:15.880 --> 20:19.960
Leave him up there. It doesn't bother me.
I'll take it from here. Thank you.

20:21.320 --> 20:24.240
Well, who are we today?

20:24.320 --> 20:27.320
Harold Lloyd? King Kong?
Napoleon's parrot?

20:27.400 --> 20:29.640
I'm not nuts.

20:29.760 --> 20:32.320
I keep telling everybody, don't you
think I wanna get out of here...

20:32.400 --> 20:34.840
and see <i>E. T.</i>

20:34.880 --> 20:39.160
I have a sneaky feeling
that you're faking all this.

20:39.240 --> 20:41.440
If you could prove that,
I'd sure appreciate it...

20:41.520 --> 20:44.320
'cause they think I'm looney tunes,
and I keep telling them...

What were we talking about?

21:00.600 --> 21:02.920
We were, uh...

21:02.960 --> 21:06.840
We were talking about the fact that
you flew the mission over the D.M.Z.

21:06.920 --> 21:11.200
<i>You were the A-Team pilot</i>
<i>in "Nam. You dropped off Smith,</i>
<i>Baracus and Peck...</i>

on top of this dresser?

21:35.720 --> 21:38.280
I'm not up here
for the fresh air.

21:38.400 --> 21:41.440
What happened to your head?

21:41.520 --> 21:44.760
They hook you up to this machine

21:45.960 --> 21:47.920
a zapper-roo to the old noggin.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.680
- Electric shock therapy?

<i>lt"s on everything.</i>

22:22.560 --> 22:25.120
The man flew everything
from jets to choppers.

22:25.200 --> 22:27.920
He was in the Thunderbirds
before the war.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.520
One of the best combat pilots in 'Nam.

22:30.640 --> 22:33.080
Snapped. No doubt about it.

22:35.240 --> 22:37.880
Okay, we've got one lead left.

- His Uncle Deke Murdock.

No. He hates his Uncle Deke

let me out.

He didn't. I did. I had to bring
your Uncle Deke into town.

- You don't have an Uncle Deke.

31:17.960 --> 31:22.240

He thinks I'm doing a ring job on it
over the weekend. I got us a Gulfstream.
Can you fly it?

31:33.200 --> 31:35.120
Hey, brother,
if it's got wings, I can fly it.

31:35.200 --> 31:38.120
- Great.
- Hey, Face, what's a Gulfstream?

31:55.800 --> 32:00.440
Amy Allen. I'm Hannibal Smith.
I understand you wanna hire the A-Team.

32:00.480 --> 32:04.280
- Mm-hmm
- We'll take the job.
You got the money and the picture?

32:04.360 --> 32:05.920
- Yeah.
- Give it to me.

32:06.040 --> 32:08.240
- Later.
- You wanna go to Mexico?

32:08.320 --> 32:10.400
You got it.

32:15.200 --> 32:19.360
Right now? I'm not packed.
What about my car?

32:19.440 --> 32:22.640
Lock it and leave it. We're leaving.
You got five seconds.

32:28.680 --> 32:33.120
Miss Amy Allen, may I present
Bosco Baracus. B.A.

32:33.200 --> 32:35.520
Don't worry about it.
He's got a bad attitude.

32:35.600 --> 32:38.320
But he'll grow on you.
Let's go, B.A.

32:43.520 --> 32:46.080
Colonel Lynch, this is Mark.
I made him.

32:46.160 --> 32:49.440

<i>of the</i> Courier Express.

33:15.480 --> 33:18.360
I've been laying the groundwork
on this plane deal for two months.

33:18.480 --> 33:20.400
Just keep your mouth shut.

33:20.480 --> 33:24.200
- Jo Bob Jameson.
- Howdy, Avon.

33:24.280 --> 33:27.440
I thought you and your Daddy Hank
bought that Lear in Santa Barbara.

33:27.520 --> 33:32.720
Before we start yammering away
on these business details, I want you
to meet my personal pilot.

33:32.840 --> 33:35.600
This here's a fella by the name
of Buster Hawthorn.

33:35.720 --> 33:38.880
- You give Avon a big old howdy.
- Big howdy.

33:40.680 --> 33:44.840
Buster, why don't you mosey
on over there and take a real good
look at that Gulfstream...

33:44.920 --> 33:48.640
and we're gonna see if Avon and Jo Bob
gonna be able to cut us a calf here.

33:50.080 --> 33:53.480
- So, tell me what happened to the Lear.
- Oh. Well...

33:54.600 --> 33:56.680
This is gonna give you a big yahoo.

33:56.800 --> 33:59.360
All right. I get that little sucker
on home to Texas.

33:59.440 --> 34:03.240
Daddy Hank, he gets in.
He sets down. He's all excited.

34:03.320 --> 34:06.720
And I'll be damned if his Stetson
doesn't bang the top of that cabin.

34:06.800 --> 34:10.360
<i>He was madder than a hornets"nest</i>
<i>in a rainstorm. It was driving him nuts.</i>

34:10.440 --> 34:12.760
So he says to me, "Jo Bob..."
He calls me Jo Bob.

34:12.840 --> 34:17.239
"Jo Bob, you get back on out there
and get me that Gulfstream
you was telling me about."

34:17.320 --> 34:19.320
So, here I am.

34:19.400 --> 34:22.360
- We can make the deal.
- You know what I was thinking though?

34:22.440 --> 34:26.880
I thought if I could test-fly that sucker
on down to Houston, Daddy Hank...
I call him Daddy Hank...

34:27.000 --> 34:28.840
<i>he"s down there</i>
<i>horse-trading hotels.</i>

34:28.960 --> 34:31.600
If I could fly him around
over the weekend...

34:31.679 --> 34:34.000
just make sure he ain't gonna
have no problems.

34:34.120 --> 34:37.239
I'd hate to have him knock
his hat off in the john.

34:37.320 --> 34:39.520
- I'll just make up the sales agreement.
- <i>Now listen here.</i>

34:39.600 --> 34:42.719
I'm a rude man.
Do y'all want a cheque, a deposit?

34:42.840 --> 34:46.440
Oh, no. Your credit's okay
with us, Jo Bob.

34:46.520 --> 34:48.600
You keep talking like that,
I'm gonna take you with me.

34:48.719 --> 34:51.719
- Where we going?
- We're gonna turn right up here.

34:51.800 --> 34:55.880
I ain't going to no airport, Hannibal. I ain't
gonna fly with that crazy fool Murdock.

34:57.520 --> 34:59.920
- Did I mention Murdock?
- Murdock?

35:00.000 --> 35:03.640
- We're not going to the airport, B.A.
- Isn't Murdock kind of crazy?

35:03.720 --> 35:05.880
If he's flying,
then we're dying.

35:05.920 --> 35:08.800

35:10.960 --> 35:12.880
Turn right, right up there.

35:24.600 --> 35:26.520

35:26.600 --> 35:31.480
- I think I'll get out for a minute.
- <i>[B.A.] What"s going on here?</i>

35:31.560 --> 35:34.840
This road leads directly
to the airport, Hannibal.

to you next time you tried to take me
on an airplane, didn't I?

36:00.440 --> 36:03.160
- What is going on?
- Now, B. A...

36:03.240 --> 36:06.200
you're gonna have one
of your anxiety blackouts and...

36:08.080 --> 36:11.360
Now take it easy, B.A.
Take it easy.

36:13.200 --> 36:16.400
- Why'd he hit you?
- Hit me?

36:16.480 --> 36:18.440
If he'd hit me,
I'd be in the hospital.

36:19.720 --> 36:22.320

they're headed towards the airport.

Wait a minute.
Let me get his foot.

36:43.920 --> 36:46.000
You have to do this
every time he flies?

36:46.080 --> 36:48.400
He's afraid to fly.
Kind of silly, isn't it?

36:48.520 --> 36:52.080
It's a notch or two past silly.
This is ridiculous.

36:52.160 --> 36:54.160

- <i>Oh, that?</i>

Welcome to Air Chance.
Sorry. We're out of kosher dinners.

37:14.840 --> 37:17.920
- Lynch is coming.
- Murdock!

37:20.480 --> 37:24.200

Get the clearance.

37:30.600 --> 37:32.800

38:28.720 --> 38:31.120
Hey, Faceman.
How you doing?

38:31.200 --> 38:33.640
Hannibal wanted me to tell you
we're headed to Acapulco.

38:33.720 --> 38:37.320
I don't have no flight plans for Mexico.
I could follow up the coast,
but we don't have enough fuel.

38:37.400 --> 38:40.200
It's better if I swing by the airport
and try to pick up a flight
and follow it down.

38:40.280 --> 38:43.160
All right, look, I have a 3:30...

38:43.240 --> 38:46.040

38:50.280 --> 38:52.200
<i>They"re both out of L.A.X.</i>

38:52.280 --> 38:55.320
I think that we go 4:10 Western
to Acapulco.

They're big red and white ones.
They're easier to see.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.240
And their pilots don't mind
if you hitchhike.

39:03.720 --> 39:06.440
Excuse me, but what are you doing?

39:06.520 --> 39:09.440

so he won't kill us if he comes to.

Excuse me again,

- Isn't he on the team?
- Yes.

39:18.200 --> 39:20.840
- Then why'd you have to drug him?
- He hates the pilot.

39:20.960 --> 39:24.080
- Hates the pilot? Why?
- Because our pilot is insane.

39:24.160 --> 39:27.920

straight right now.

Twenty-five thousand and change.

40:40.600 --> 40:44.640
You came up a little short, honey.
Twenty-five thousand
won't keep us in jet fuel.

45:57.200 --> 45:59.280
- <i>[Face]</i>
<i>Got a favourite hotel down here?</i>
- Nah.

45:59.360 --> 46:01.760
- The Princess is nice.
- Good enough. Let's go.

46:01.880 --> 46:04.320
We gotta get some new threads
before we hit the Princess.

46:04.400 --> 46:06.760
It's Friday already?

46:20.560 --> 46:23.760
- [Speaks Spanish] Are you checking in?
- I'm with 20th Century Fox.

46:23.920 --> 46:26.880
- We're with the movie company.
- Pardon me, sir?

46:26.960 --> 46:29.520
The Farrah Fawcett, Bo Derek,
Loni Anderson movie.

46:29.560 --> 46:32.280
- The what?
- Of course you've been told about it.

46:32.360 --> 46:36.480
I'm sorry, sir, but I know nothing
about that. Perhaps at the desk.

46:36.600 --> 46:39.720
Oh, boy. There better not have been
a foul-up on this.

46:39.800 --> 46:43.320
My head will roll
if this deal got messed up too.

46:57.600 --> 47:00.520
- [Hannibal] Okay, this is the place.
- [Allen] What place?

47:00.600 --> 47:04.640
Telephone numbers in Massey's notes,
it belongs to this joint.

47:04.720 --> 47:07.760
You're the backup.
I'll go in and tip the joint over.

47:07.880 --> 47:11.040
- See what happens.
- I'm going with you.

47:11.120 --> 47:13.320
- You got health insurance?
- Yes.

47:13.400 --> 47:16.640
"Tip the joint over"?
Very macho, but is it smart?

47:16.720 --> 47:19.760
If I was smart, I wouldn't be working
for some skirt with no money.

47:22.400 --> 47:26.280
You learn to love him, mama,
but it takes a long time.

47:26.400 --> 47:29.680
That's the same thing
he said about you.

47:39.240 --> 47:43.440
This place looks long on local colour
and short on blended whisky.

47:43.520 --> 47:46.680
- I hope you have a plan.
- Of course I do, Miss Allen.

47:46.760 --> 47:48.160
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Hey, señor.</i>

47:48.240 --> 47:50.440
This bar is not
for American tourists.

47:50.520 --> 47:54.280
Glad to hear it. It's kind of hot out there.
You got a couple of beers?

47:54.360 --> 47:57.440
<i>We have nothing for you here,</i>
<i>except a warning.</i>

47:57.520 --> 48:01.240
Go now. There is plenty cantinas
down at the beach.

48:01.320 --> 48:04.600
I'm looking for a man
named Manny Cortez.

48:08.160 --> 48:10.040
- Is this part of the plan?
- No.

48:10.120 --> 48:13.080
<i>[Speaking Spanish]</i>

48:15.600 --> 48:19.120
We are not little children to be impressed
because you speak our language.

48:19.160 --> 48:21.560
<i>We"re gonna find out</i>
<i>what you want.</i>

48:21.640 --> 48:23.520
- Is this...
- No.

48:23.600 --> 48:26.240
You want tough?
You got tough.

48:27.600 --> 48:29.920
B.A.!

48:43.840 --> 48:46.160
- Quintana!
- [Speaks Spanish]

48:46.240 --> 48:48.280
<i>[Speaks Spanish]</i>

49:02.320 --> 49:05.560
- You want him?
- No, you take him.

49:12.840 --> 49:14.720
- [People Shouting]
- Is this part of the plan?

49:14.800 --> 49:17.880
- No.
- I didn't think so.

49:41.720 --> 49:44.080
[Speaks Spanish]

50:15.280 --> 50:16.840
Oh, well.

50:27.320 --> 50:30.400
Amy Allen.
<i>Los Angeles Courier Express.</i>

50:30.480 --> 50:34.000
- If I might explain...
- I wasn't talking to you, <i>chico,</i>
so keep it still.

50:34.040 --> 50:37.280
<i>Why do you want Manny Cortez?</i>

50:37.360 --> 50:41.240
I'm looking for a friend of mine.
His name is Al Massey.

50:41.320 --> 50:43.320
He also worked on the <i>Courier.</i>

50:43.360 --> 50:46.160
He was down here on a story
and he disappeared.

50:46.240 --> 50:49.400
- I wanna find him.
- [Spanish]

50:51.240 --> 50:54.960
So he told you about her.
But that doesn't tell us who you are, sonny.

50:55.040 --> 50:57.360
I'm the man you
so desperately seek, señor.

50:58.480 --> 51:00.880
I'm Manny Cortez.

51:01.960 --> 51:04.000
I love it when a plan comes together.

51:05.440 --> 51:08.000
[Spanish]

51:08.040 --> 51:10.880
Al Massey was captured by a bandit,
Malavida Valdez.

51:10.960 --> 51:12.840
<i>He"s terrorizing villages</i>
<i>in the mountains.</i>

51:12.920 --> 51:16.680
I'm a marked man.
Valdez has agents in Puntarenas.

51:16.800 --> 51:20.120
- I must be careful.
- <i>[Allen] What about Al? Is he okay?</i>

51:20.240 --> 51:22.720
There's a chance he's still alive.

51:22.800 --> 51:26.640
- We'll talk about it later.
- <i>[Hannibal] We"re at the Princess Hotel.</i>

51:34.640 --> 51:38.040
[B.A.]
Hello. All right!

51:38.120 --> 51:42.360
- [Allen] How much did this place cost?
- [Hannibal] Nothing. It's on the house.

51:42.400 --> 51:46.000
José, the manager, couldn't turn
any rooms, so we had to settle
for the owner's villa.

51:46.120 --> 51:48.640
Everybody's got their own room.
You'll find clothing in the bedroom closet.

51:48.720 --> 51:52.520
Miguel, the film commissioner,
is reading the script.
Get him out there beating the bushes.

51:52.600 --> 51:56.680
The rewrites are coming tomorrow. The
green pages will have most of the scenes
that contain the equipment we need.

51:56.760 --> 51:59.280
- Good.
- Do you do this all the time?

51:59.360 --> 52:02.960
- We haven't done the movie company
in six months.
- So, what do we do next?

52:03.040 --> 52:07.080
See Manny Cortez, get his story, scrounge
the stuff we need and get out of town.

52:07.160 --> 52:11.320
Tomorrow morning, I wanna be
on my way to San Rio Blanco.

52:12.320 --> 52:14.720
[Cortez]
Valdez usually comes in from this direction.

52:14.800 --> 52:18.680
It's all open out here. Any sentry could
spot him almost a mile and a half away.

52:18.800 --> 52:23.240
- You've got to have some idea
where the marijuana fields are.
- Somewhere in here.

52:23.320 --> 52:27.600
<i>The townpeople who has been forced</i>
<i>to work on the fields estimate them</i>
<i>to be approximately five miles...</i>

52:27.680 --> 52:31.480
which, by jeep,
would put it somewhere in this radius.

52:31.560 --> 52:34.000
<i>Whenever he takes them out there,</i>
<i>they are blindfolded.</i>

52:34.120 --> 52:38.760
Don't worry. If it's inside a five mile radius,
I can spot it... from the air.

52:38.880 --> 52:41.560
- We're gonna need some armour plating.
- Got it.

52:41.640 --> 52:44.920
And a deuce and a half.
Maybe a dump truck. Something big.

52:45.000 --> 52:46.920
Ten-wheeler?

52:47.000 --> 52:49.760
I think we'll spray this guy's field.

52:49.800 --> 52:53.280
A crop duster and some poison
to kill his marijuana crops.

52:53.360 --> 52:56.160
I love it when a mark is angry.
They don't think straight.

52:56.240 --> 52:58.520
And it'll bring him to us.
Make him play on our field.

52:58.600 --> 53:01.320
Poison.

53:01.440 --> 53:03.960
Crop duster.

53:04.040 --> 53:08.880
I'd love some artillery.
A 105 would be beautiful. Recoilless.

53:08.960 --> 53:13.200
That's gonna be tough to work into
a picture called <i>Boots and Bikinis.</i>

53:13.240 --> 53:15.640
I'll get something.
Don't bother Miguel.

53:15.800 --> 53:18.760
<i>Wait a minute. How are you</i>
<i>gonna get all that stuff?</i>

53:18.840 --> 53:24.120
We're not. Miguel, the film commissioner,
is, if Amy will lend us a hand.

53:24.200 --> 53:26.720
The director, Andre,
is coming down tomorrow...

53:26.840 --> 53:29.760
with Bo, Loni, and Farrah,
and nothing's been set up.

53:29.840 --> 53:34.120
Boobala, you know I'm in big trouble
with Andre. I mean, chickie, my job
is hanging by the ol' threadola.

53:34.200 --> 53:36.160
But, Mr Peck, a crop duster?

53:36.240 --> 53:39.440
Three-inch metal plating? None of these
things were in the script that I read.

53:39.480 --> 53:42.120
- Amy!
- It's all in the greens.

53:42.240 --> 53:46.080
You did get the green pages? I had you on
the distribution list with all the revisions.

53:46.160 --> 53:49.840
<i>l"ll straighten that out and get you</i>
<i>a xerox of my copy, Mr Perez.</i>

53:49.960 --> 53:52.560
[Chuckles]
Miguel.

53:52.600 --> 53:55.440
I still don't see. The story I read
was about three American blonds...

53:55.520 --> 53:59.640
<i>who fall in love with a lifeguard,</i>
<i>a bullfighter and a schoolteacher.</i>

53:59.720 --> 54:03.400
<i>Andre"s got this idea about stickin"</i>
<i>in this cornball dream sequence.</i>

54:03.480 --> 54:05.480
Bo Derek on the wing of a biplane...

54:05.560 --> 54:08.320
spraying this field
that her lover is standing in below.

54:08.400 --> 54:11.440
You want my opinion? It stinks! That kinda
stuff went out with capped teeth.

54:11.520 --> 54:14.920
- But if he wants it, he gets it.
- And the armour plating is for what?

54:15.000 --> 54:19.840
- It's not armour plating, Mike.
- It's metal bulkhead
for the submarine sequence.

54:19.920 --> 54:22.200
<i>I know. I know.</i> Qué <i>submarine?</i>

54:22.320 --> 54:26.120
Well, the part of the lifeguard
has been rewritten.
He's now a sub commander.

54:26.240 --> 54:28.360
<i>We"re doing two scenes</i>
<i>where Loni comes aboard the sub.</i>

54:28.440 --> 54:30.440
But we have no submarines
in our navy.

54:30.520 --> 54:35.760
It's a fluff picture, Mike.
The director is a nut bar. Nothin' makes
sense in Hollywood any more.

54:35.880 --> 54:40.600
Listen. Just help me here. Stay with me,
boobie. At least I'm not asking you
for a lousy cannon.

54:55.080 --> 54:58.080
<i>A bus? What happened</i>
<i>to the 10-wheel truck?</i>

54:58.120 --> 55:01.440
It's the best I could do on such short notice.
I'm working Miguel overtime.

55:01.520 --> 55:04.160
We got a line on the armour plating
and the crop duster.

55:04.240 --> 55:08.680
We're having trouble getting poison,
so I got him working on bleach, but
he's beginning to wheeze when he walks.

55:08.760 --> 55:11.200
Use ammonia. That stuff's terrific.

55:11.240 --> 55:13.680
<i>[Hannibal]</i>
<i>Good idea. Use ammonia.</i>

55:13.800 --> 55:18.640
B.A. and I'll load the bus.
You go with Howling Mad.
Now, drop the stuff in the field at noon.

55:18.720 --> 55:20.840
- You got the leaflets?
- Yeah.

55:20.960 --> 55:24.800
- Had to spend some of
Amy's cash to get these.
- Mount up and roll it.

55:24.880 --> 55:26.800
We'll pick up Manny at Loco Toro.

55:26.880 --> 55:28.920
This thing ain't
gonna make it five miles.

55:29.000 --> 55:33.240
- <i>Tyres worn out. Sucker need new rings.</i>
- <i>B.A., you can fix anything.</i>

55:33.320 --> 55:37.720
Our director, Andre, has got
real confidence in you, boobala.

55:37.800 --> 55:41.120
When this piece of junk start
woofing out smoke and blowing gaskets...

55:41.200 --> 55:43.400
Andre ain't gonna be so happy.

55:58.520 --> 56:01.640
- What's this?
- <i>That"s a tent tightener.</i>

56:04.120 --> 56:07.480
- Where do you come from?
- Actually, I'm a rancher.

56:07.560 --> 56:09.360
<i>- [Allen] A rancher?</i>
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>

56:09.440 --> 56:11.560
Like in rope 'em and brand 'em?

56:11.640 --> 56:15.400
Got over 200 acres and more
head of cow than people can drink milk.

56:15.520 --> 56:19.680
I miss ridin' over the north 40
Sunday mornings...

56:19.760 --> 56:22.640
sitting on top of ol' Topper...

56:22.720 --> 56:25.560
Iookin' across my spread.

56:25.680 --> 56:27.840
It's the place I call home.

56:27.920 --> 56:31.600
You're not a rancher. That's bull.

56:31.680 --> 56:34.360
Nice, though, isn't it?

57:14.400 --> 57:16.840
[Spanish]

57:20.480 --> 57:22.840
I was born in this town.

57:22.960 --> 57:24.920
My family has lived here
for 200 years.

57:25.000 --> 57:26.960
These people are good.

57:27.040 --> 57:29.000
I hope they're brave.

57:29.080 --> 57:33.160
If we're gonna run off some bandits,
we're gonna need some help.

57:33.240 --> 57:36.120
No! How many more of you want
to be beaten by that maniac...

57:36.240 --> 57:38.160
or those pigs who ride with him?

57:38.240 --> 57:41.040
If you don't fight back,
he'll continue beating you.

57:41.080 --> 57:43.880
How long can this go on?

57:43.920 --> 57:47.600
He's right.
Our fathers would spit on us.

57:47.680 --> 57:49.640
We have been cowards.

57:49.720 --> 57:53.760
It is better to fight and die
than to run like children.

57:53.840 --> 57:57.880
We're here because
we're friends of Al Massey.

57:57.920 --> 58:01.040
You listened to him.
He tried to help you.

58:01.160 --> 58:04.680
He was dragged from this town
by Malavida Valdez.

58:04.760 --> 58:08.640
And I, for one, do not wish to fight.
We are not soldiers.

58:08.720 --> 58:10.600
I am a soldier.

58:10.720 --> 58:12.560
But we are not strong enough.

58:12.720 --> 58:15.200
Hold it.

58:15.280 --> 58:19.200
<i>You mean you people are gonna let</i>
<i>this man continue to beat on your heads?</i>

58:20.400 --> 58:23.400
There ain't nothin' in the world
worth losin' your pride for.

58:24.240 --> 58:28.080
Life don't mean nothin'
unless you can hold your head up high.

58:28.160 --> 58:33.240
I know. 'Cause I come from a place
where the rats are big as alley cats.

58:33.320 --> 58:38.440
I had no money.
Didn't have a house to stay in.

58:38.560 --> 58:41.480
But, brother, let me tell you something.

58:41.560 --> 58:45.880
Nobody ever pushed me around.

58:46.960 --> 58:51.600
Look at you. Standin' here
lookin' at your shoes.

58:51.680 --> 58:57.000
Moanin' about some dumb,
big, fat, stupid, stinkin' bandit.

58:57.080 --> 59:00.000
<i>I suppose I can understand</i>
<i>one man runnin"scared...</i>

59:00.120 --> 59:02.120
but a whole town?

59:04.280 --> 59:06.240
A whole village?

59:08.480 --> 59:10.560
You people might as well be dead.

59:17.360 --> 59:22.840
I call for a vote. All of those who would
drive this bandit out of our town,
raise their hands.

59:30.480 --> 59:33.720
[Spanish]

59:48.800 --> 59:51.800
You're right.
He really does grow on you.

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:15.720
[Children Laughing]

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:17.840
What do you kids want?

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:32.440
Okay. Come on. You kids
can help me carry this pole.

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:34.480
Let's go. Let's go.

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:21.120
Heads up.
Look out below!

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:29.720
Looks like you got
some help, huh?

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:34.680
- I love kids.
- <i>They seem to like you too.</i>

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:37.600
I guess they're not fooled
by that scowl you're always wearing.

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:40.480
Look, lady, the way I am
is the way I am.

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:43.440
<i>If I scare people, it gives me room.</i>

01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:45.760
How do people work with you
if they're so afraid...

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:48.480
you're gonna rip their tongue out
if they say the wrong thing to you?

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:52.720
You talkin' about Hannibal?
He ain't afraid of nothin'.

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:56.360
- You think he has a death wish?
- No. He's just got the jazz.

01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:58.480
That's all.
Hannibal got the jazz.

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:00.480
- The jazz?
- Yep.

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:04.720
He's been livin' on the edge ever since
I known him. He's one crazy,
hooked-together dude.

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:06.720
<i>That"s what kept him alive</i>
<i>through "Nam.</i>

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:08.840
Kept me and the others alive also.

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:11.600
- Then why do you do it?
- For the jazz, baby.

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:13.600
It's like walkin' into
a casino in Vegas...

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:17.200

01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:23.080
and I think I caught the fever.

01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:27.000
- So?
- So, you let me in...

01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:29.960
or I write the book
and blow your cover.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.880
I said I ain't gettin'
on no airplane, Hannibal.

01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:38.880
Come on, you guys. I can help you
with lots of stuff. I have the paper.

01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:42.520
<i>I have influence. I have the computer</i>
<i>at the paper for research stuff.</i>

01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:44.720
And I have the first amendment
to hide behind.

01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:48.400
- We'll talk about it on the airplane.
- I ain't goin' on no airplane.

01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:51.760
- Ah, come on, B.A. Be a sport!
- Got you!

01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:54.880
<i>Told you you wouldn"t</i>
<i>get me this time, sucker! No, sirree.</i>

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.680
Now, B.A., you know
I wouldn't try to fool you.

01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:00.280
<i>Don"t put no dog pound shuffle</i>
<i>on me, Hannibal!</i>

01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:08.040
- [Weakly Grunting]
- [Horn Honking]

01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:11.800
Get him off the horn, Face.
You drive.

01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:14.080
Then I traced these people to L. A...

01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:18.960
where I found that they'd scammed
this aircraft off a jet saleslady.

01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:22.440
We can't release this plane.
It's being held until we find the pilot.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:32.320
Ah, Mr Sanchez, thank you
for the use of the car.

01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:36.440
Ah, Lynch. Excuse us,
but we have to take this plane.
We're going back to the U.S. of A.

01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:38.560
No, no. Excuse me.
You're under arrest, Colonel.

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:41.320
- All of you are under arrest.
- Only thing is...

01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:43.360
we've got to put you
in the trunk of that car.

01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:45.920
<i>[Face]</i>
<i>Colonel!</i>

01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:48.120
- Nice.
- I enjoyed it.

01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:52.920
We are getting out of <i>México!</i>

01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:04.480
Hey, Lynch!
Lose a little weight, will ya?

01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:11.520
Sadly, our pilot died.

01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:14.160
We're taking him back
to Washington for full military burial.

01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:16.840
Hang in there.
You guys run a hell of an airport.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:33.040
- I love this jazz.
- What's your full name, kid?

01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:35.400
- Amy Amanda Allen.
- Triple "A," huh?

01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:39.160
Sounds like somebody who belongs
on a unit called the A-Team.

01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:48.680
