WEBVTT

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
MAN:
Okay.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
So tell us a little bit
about yourself.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
I'm the founder of 23 different
radical leftist organizations,

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
MAN:
Where's the towel?

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
including the Africans Fighting
Racism and Oppression,

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
Hey!

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
or AFRO, if you will,

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
Hey!

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
uh, the Black Revolutionary
Organization, or BRO,

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Hey!

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Noooooo!

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Watch where
you're walking, nigga.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
uh...

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Yeah, sure.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
H-hey, what you say, nigga?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
People tell me

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
MAN:
Yeah, baby.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
: Watch closely.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
MAN 2:
You hear something?

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
I look like
Bill Cosby all the time--

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
You're about to experience a "Nigga Moment."

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
I mean, excuse me--

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Dr. Bill Cosby.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Webster defines the "Nigga Moment"

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Especially when I wear
these sunglasses.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
as a moment when ignorance overwhelms the mind

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Yeah. Yeah,
my name is Riley, son.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
of an otherwise logical Negro male--

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
But, you know, niggas call me

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
What did you say,
bitch nigga?

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
a.k.a. Riley Escobar.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Hey, squeeze it, nigga!

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
No.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
You know what I'm saying?

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
--causing him to act in an illogical,

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
'Cause I be in the streets,
you know?

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
No, not me.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
self-destructive manner, i.e., like a nigga.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Soap drop, nigga.
Huh?

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
I got all kinds of names,
like H.R. Paperstacks,

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Yeah.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Oh, you think you just gonna
leave it down there?

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
uh, also known as,
a.k.a. Horse Choker.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
You want it?
Right here.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Huh?

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Uh...

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
We don't waste
no motherfuckin' soap in here.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
And also the Black Revolutionary
Underground Heroes.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
I'm-- I'm finished.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
MAN:
Um...

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
Nigga Moments are unpredictable.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
Naw, naw, nigga,
you ain't finished.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
BRUH?

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
Hey, wait, man. Wait.
This is stupid.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Yeah, BRUH.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
A.k.a. Pillsbury Doughboy.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
I been watching you.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
You have?

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Hey, you right, dawg.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
You ain't wash behind
your ears or nothing.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
A.k.a. Louis Rich.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
Look, let's put the guns away
and go on about our business.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
But I did.
See, look at me.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
MAN:
Like the turkey bacon?

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
MAN: Freeze!

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
See how I'm all clean
and glistening and shit.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Yeah, like the--
What?

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
HUEY: But they all end up bad.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
So like I was saying,

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
That's hygiene, nigga.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
I've always believed
that Cosbyness

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
If they had their own category, Nigga Moments

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
You can call me
the health inspector.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
is next to godliness.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
would be the third leading killer of black men

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
Now, pick up the soap!

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
So my granddad's wearing
his Bill Cosby shades,

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
behind pork chops and FEMA.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
MAN:
Be brave, son. Be brave.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
and I'm like,
"This nigga look blind."

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
It's a fact.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
I'm next.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
And then I thought,
"Boom, I got an idea.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Now, let's see how a Nigga Moment

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
SARAH:
Drop the soap again?

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
affects a white man.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
I know how we can get
this money."

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Prick.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Watch where you walkin', bitch.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
HUEY: Tom DuBois' greatest fear

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
And I made a tape.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
was being sent to prison and anally raped.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
What did you--?

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Wait a minute.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
At the tender age of 10, Tom saw a prison movie,

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
I'm white.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
Dear Xzibit,
my name is Riley Freeman.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
which depicted the violent anal raping of a man.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Where you goin'?

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
If my granddad has one weakness,

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Don't you ignore me.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Before then, he didn't know that men got raped in prison.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
This is a perfectly
good moment

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
it's bitches.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
to throw your life away.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
: Stop! Ah!

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
HUEY: It is true that,

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
statistically speaking,

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
He's been a lonely man

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
A big misconception about the Nigga Moment

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
ever since he had a bleach fight

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
is that it can be avoided

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
if a man is to be raped,

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
it'll most likely occur in prison.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
with his first wife and went blind.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
by simply moving away from niggas.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
If only it were that easy.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
That fact scared straight-laced Tom even straighter.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
See, niggas always got a new trick

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
All he's got in this world is his car, Dorothy.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
right around the corner.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Let's steal some.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
The car's in pretty bad shape.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
But what if we get caught?

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
And everyone knows that bitches don't really check

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
We'll get arrested
and anally raped.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
for niggas with beat-up cars.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
I'm Robert Freeman's driver.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
And I'm tired of driving
this piece-of-shit car he got.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Hey, guys, what are you doing?

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Just smoking a joint.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Give him somethin' better.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Listen up, boys.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
But maybe if he had a nicer car,

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
I'm about to sing
the "New Shoes" song.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
You want a hit?

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Yeah, right.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
he might be able to get a date,

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
You guys can go to jail
and get anally raped if ya want.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
and not have to pay for it.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Please, Xzibit.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Boy, Nike makes some good shoes.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Tom, did you erase
all my MP3s?

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Oh, hold up, hold up.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Hoo!

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
MAN:

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
Hey, file-sharing is a crime,

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
and I'm not
gonna be anally raped,

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
MAN:
Oh!

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
Please, Xzibit,
pimp my ride.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
so you can listen to Usher.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
You know, Tom,
this whole "anal rape" thing

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
GRANDDAD:
What the hell?

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
For my grandfather.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
is really causing both of us
to miss out on a lot in life.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Hey! What's goin' on, man?
Damn!

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
For 9/11.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
I know there's nobody
in my space.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
For America.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
This is handicapped parking.
Isn't it?

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
HUEY: But Tom didn't care

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
what he was missing out on.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
What's up, y'all?
This X-to-the-Z, Xzibit,

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
GRANDDAD:
Don't do that, don't do that!

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
Well into adulthood, Tom still lived his life

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
HUEY:
Yo, man, watch

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
where you're going.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
and we here at the house
of Riley Freeman.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
around the fear of anal rape.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
GRANDDAD:
Stupid son of a bitch!

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
And we about to pimp

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
HUEY: Every Nigga Moment begins

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
with the nigga.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
That fear, perhaps more than any other factor,

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
his grandfather's car,
Dorothy.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
made him the man he is today.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
As you can see,
Dorothy is way past her prime.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Without that key element,

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
all you're left with is peace and quiet.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Tom believed in order.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
I mean, look at the paint job.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
Colonel H. Stinkmeaner is, and always has been,

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
This car look like
it need some lotion.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
He obeyed every traffic law.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
He had never as much as broken the speed limit.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
a cantankerous, ornery old man.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
Oh, snap.
It's Xzibit.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
He spent his childhood disagreeing with most things,

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
You drive like an old bitch!

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Yeah, nigga, yeah.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
especially things involving happiness,

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
What up,
homey?

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
I'm here to pimp
your ride.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
unity and kindness.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
GRANDDAD:
Who the hell is that

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
at the door?

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Tom grew up to be a criminal prosecutor,

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
Stinkmeaner got no pleasure seeing sunsets and trees,

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
which, ironically enough, meant his job was to send

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Shh.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Come here. Hurry up.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
dolphins or rainbows.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
many black men to the very fate he most feared.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Stay down.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
Man, this some old bullshit.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
Yo. Why are we hiding?

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
For the crime of selling four
bootleg copies of  Soul Plane,

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Are you kidding?

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
So he didn't particularly mind

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
If he comes out here
and finds

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
his favorite rapper,
Xzibit,

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
when at age 15, he lost his sight to cancer.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
the defendant is sentenced
to two weeks imprisonment.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
fixing to pimp his ride,

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
he'll have a heart attack.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
He'll be remanded--
No!

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
At least I don't have to look
at your ugly ass no more.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
For real?

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Don't send me to prison!

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
I'm his favorite
rapper?

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
The doctors gave him three years to live.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Please! Please don't
send me to prison!

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Man loves
your whole catalog.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
So he dedicated those three years

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
I don't want
to be anally raped!

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
But now y'all gotta
get the hell

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
to spreading a lifetime of misery and hatred.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
HUEY: And Tom knew firsthand

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
that a black man

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
up out of here
before he finds you.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
And I want some,
uh, 23-inch rims,

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
You danged fool!

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
didn't have to do much to go to prison.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Nobody knows how Stinkmeaner managed to live so long.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
and, uh, uh--
And I want five televisions.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
MAN:
You have the right

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
to remain silent...

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
And I want a toilet seat
in the trunk.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
He believed it was his love of hatred that kept him going.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
Sometimes, he didn't have to do anything at all.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Hey, man,
we just doing--

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Get the hell
out of here!

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Who in the hell parked
in my space?

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
You ain't stealing
my--!

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
...in a court
of law.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Hey, man!
Hey, hold on! Hey!

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
That's like calling
1-800-Collect-An-Ass-Whupping.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
You have the right
to speak to an attorney

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Get out!
Stop, Granddad! Stop!

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
and to have an attorney
present during any questioning.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
And no, that ain't
no toll-free call, partner.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Stop, Granddad!

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
XZIBIT: Yo, just--!
Come on, man!

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
If you cannot afford--

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Goddamn.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
GRANDDAD:
You hit my car!

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
: And in other news,

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
city police are reporting tonight

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Are you blind?

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
Yes, I am! So?

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
that they have arrested a suspect in connection

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
with the murder of Antoine Michaels,

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
Dude, you got fucked up
by that old-ass man.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Wait. You're blind?

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Yes!

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
a 17-year-old who was apparently killed

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Blind!

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
You got a problem
with that, ni-yagga?

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
over a game of "Madden 2006."

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
The police are not releasing the name of the suspect,

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
You could have killed somebody.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Oh, look at the wheels. Oh, my God!

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
I-I'd be doing them a favor.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
who is a black male,

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Oh, my goodness.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
approximately blah, blah, blah--

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
See, you too could have
a TV in the steering wheel.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Getting run over by me

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
is as close
to an honorable death

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
And so, we are raising the terror alert level

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
as most of these people
are gonna get.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Boy, Dorothy isn't just a car.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
to intense orange/red based on very credible,

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
Some days,
I'm quite the humanitarian.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
I've loved and cared
for that vehicle for 30 years.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
detailed information on a non-specific threat.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
You think I'm let
some damn rapper

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
Could it be a hijacking? Absolutely possible.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
put a goldfish
in the dashboard?

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
I think I hit a wheelchair
on the way over here. Heh.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
Ho's love goldfish,
Granddad.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
Chemical or biological agent? You bet it could happen.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
Oh, look what you did
to Dorothy.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
You two need
your own sitcom.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Suicide bomber?

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
You'd better have insurance.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Hey, you never know.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
All you gotta do is get
on TV with a sob story,

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
But what we do know...

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
Ni-yagga,
you better have insurance!

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
...is that it's absolutely, positively gonna happen today.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
and people give you
free stuff.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Ass-whupping insurance.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
I still ain't gonna lie
to nobody.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Maybe.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
And you about to pay
a deductible.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
If there's one thing
that I can't stand,

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
HUEY: And just like that,

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
it's lying.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
I'm a Christian man.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
my granddad was trapped in a Nigga Moment.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Terrorists have my daddy!

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
You ain't gots
to lie.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
I'll lie.
Just play along.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Jazmine, calm down.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
At this point, he can:

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Terrorists kidnapped my father,

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
They gonna fix my transmission?

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
and they're gonna cut off
his head in Algeria!

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
My daddy was supposed to be home
from work before school let out.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Gentlemen,

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Let's see which one he chooses.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
I'm sorry
about the misunderstanding.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
And he isn't here!

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
That's right.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
And we're at terror alert
level orange. Orange!

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
And, now,
w-w-where's that boy?

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
I backed into your car,
ni-yagga.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
What's his name?
Inhibit?

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
What you gonna do?

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
What you gonna do?

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
The whole catalog, huh?

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
RILEY:
Oh, hell nah.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
Granddad, let's whup
this nigga's ass right now.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
GRANDDAD:
Now, y'all gonna fix

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
my transmission, right?

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Guys, there's gotta be
some kind of mistake.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
I didn't do anything.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Oh, we know what you did.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Bitch-ass, faggot-ass,

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
punk-ass, pussy-ass,
bitch-ass nigga.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
You guys were playing
your little game,

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
and your friend was
serving up some pipin' hot

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
The tooth fairy
will be coming soon.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Do you wanna do something,

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
ass-whoopings,
wasn't he?

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
bitch-ass ni-yagga?

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
The tooth fairy?
Yep.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Hold up.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Jazmine, just because
your dad is late

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Every time
I lose a tooth,

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
the tooth fairy
takes it away

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
I smell new shoes.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
coming home from work
doesn't mean that--

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
and leaves a dollar
under my pillow.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
RILEY:
Awe, man.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
There ain't no such thing
as the tooth fairy.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Oh! Not the shoes!

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Hello?

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Fool, what you--
Hey!

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Riley, is that you?

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Put your brother on,
it's an emergency!

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Then who's leaving the money?

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
HUEY: I've said it before.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Probably your parents.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
Expensive sneakers are like $150 land mines.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
What's the emergency?

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
They have both the cash
and the access to your room.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
I'm in jail.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
Step on one and boom!

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Why would they lie to me?

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Because the truth hurts,
Jazmine.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
A perfectly rational black man can explode.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Don't drop
the soap.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
The world is a hard
and lonely place,

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
HUEY:
Who was that?

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
and nobody gets anything
for free.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Yeah!

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
They ain't new anymore
are they, ni-yagga?

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
And you wanna know what else?

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
One day, you and everyone
you know is gonna die.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
RILEY:
And that nigga's

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
spittin' on you.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Yeah?

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Riley, it's Tom.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
You better hit him,
Granddad.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Hit him. Hit him! Yeah!

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
I thought you only get
one phone call from jail.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
RILEY: Hit him!

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Oh!

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Who's this?

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
GRANDDAD: Uh-oh.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
Huey, I got arrested!

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Yeah!
My bad knee!

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
They say I fit
the description.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
MAN:
You enjoy

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Oh, Lordy-Lordy-Lord.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
I think it's
'cause I'm black, Huey.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
abusing
people's illusions.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
RILEY: What you doing, man?
My bad knee.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
You have to get me
outta here, Huey.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
I respect that.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
RILEY:
Oh, man.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
You don't wanna know
what they'll do to me in jail.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
MAN: Huh?

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
It's thankless work.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
RILEY:
You lose all your pimp status.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
They'll rape you,
that's what they're gonna do.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Do you like
my sunglasses?

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
But you're not in jail,
you're in holding.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
This fight is over.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
I wear sunglasses
because my idol, Dr. Bill Cosby,

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
And I don't think people
usually get raped in holding.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
wears sunglasses all the time.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Hold on.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
Granddad! Do people
get raped in holding?

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
And you know
what they say:

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
"Cosbyness is
next to godliness."

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Who are you?

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
Stop, stop, stop! I don't
want your granddad to know.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Nobody, really.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
GRANDDAD:
I hate this damn song.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Just thought you might
wanna talk

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
I can't believe you got

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
I don't want anybody to know.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
to someone who understands.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
your ass kicked
by a blind man, Granddad.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
Listen, they can't
keep people in holding

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
You don't know me.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
My knee went out.
You know I got a bad knee.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
I know you better
than you think, Huey Freeman.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
over the weekend.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
At 9:00 tonight,
they're gonna put me on a bus

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Bad knee?
That nigga had bad eyes.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
He couldn't see, Granddad.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
and send me to real jail.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Real jail!

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
He beat you like a piñata.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
Earliest I could get out
would be on Monday.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Nah.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
Yo, we can rent Granddad out
for Mexican birthday parties.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Well, it's just
a weekend.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
GRANDDAD:
It's not that I don't

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
believe you, Huey.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
It only takes one night
to get anally raped!

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
It's that I don't believe you,

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
We can call him
Señor Piñata.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
and  I'm not interested.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Huey, the only way for me
to get out of here

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
But, Granddad,
I am being followed

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Hola,  Señor Piñata.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
by a secret
government agent.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
is if you find
the real killer tonight.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Ain't nobody
following you.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Stop it, boy!
Stop it.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
The real killer?
Nigga, I'm 10.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Where's my belt?

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
You just want
attention.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
How am I gonna find
the real killer?

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
I bet Xzibit's
gonna put, like,

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
RILEY:
Whoo. Whoo.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
I must be blind too,

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Please!

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
30-inch rims
on the car.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
'cause I sure didn't see
that ass-whupping coming.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
You've gotta try.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
All right, all right,
all right!

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Thirty inches?

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Damn.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Is that big?

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Boy.
Riley.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
Thank you, Huey.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
He knew stuff about us,
like--

07:10.000 --> 07:15.000
Yo, how bad you gotta
telegraph your punches

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
Like-- Like the stupid
Bill Cosby sunglasses thing.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Whatever you do...

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
don't tell my baby, Jazmine.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Well, these stupid
sunglasses

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
for a blind nigga

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
to see 'em coming,
Granddad?

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
got us a new car.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
Riley, the man had
a heightened sense of hearing.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
I don't want her to know

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
her daddy was somebody's
bi-hi-hi-hi-tch.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
So you say the car stops
and the wheels keep spinning?

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Oh, I thought Granddad had
a heightened sense of falling.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
That's amazing.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Now, that's enough.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
All I'm saying is, when Xzibit
brings that car back,

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Now, you just stop laughing
at your granddaddy.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Was that daddy?
Where is he?

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
What's wrong with you?
Granddad had "hit me"

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
you gonna be bitches.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Is he okay?

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
What did you call me?

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
written on his forehead
in Braille.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
Was he kidnapped
by terrorists?

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
No, no. I mean,
bitches, like--

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
I said, that's enough!

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
Um, your father wants you
to know he's nobody's bitch.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Like you gonna have
so many bitches,

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
Okay. What you gonna do?

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
that's what niggas
is gonna call you.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Beat me?

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Maybe I should get
a blindfold first.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
No disrespect.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
No disrespect?

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Okay, I'm ready.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
You just called
your grandfather "bitches."

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Wait.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
HUEY: I had exactly five hours

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
to find a murderer,

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
Yeah, but I don't mean "bitches"
in a disrespectful way.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Maybe he gonna fall on me.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
and I couldn't do it alone.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
I mean it as
a general word for women.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
HUEY:
Riley, stop.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
Ed III was heir to the Wuncler fortune

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Granddad...
Rodney King just called,

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
And you gonna let him
get away with that?

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
It's okay...
just this once.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
and said...

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
and a drunken psychopath.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Granddad,
I'm just saying...

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
"Damn, I thought
I got my ass whupped!"

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
But the dude I was after

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
you might have to change
your middle name

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
had already killed at least one person,

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
from Jebediah to Bitches.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
Ow!

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
and one thing Ed III had was firepower.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
It's all I'm trying to say.
No disrespect.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Fuck it.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
Hm. Granddad Bitches Freeman.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
I say we go get
the motherfucker.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Hoo.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Let's go.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Got a nice ring to it.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
HUEY:
Where we going?

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Shh.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Oh, we gonna need
to holler at my man.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Did you hear that?

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
What? What is it?

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
I don't hear anything.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Shh. It's Huey's

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
make-believe
government agent.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
Oh, snap.
Ed Wuncler III.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
In our bathroom,
taking a dump.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
HUEY: That night, I dreamt

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
of a blind swordsman.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
My man, Gin Rummy.
What's good, baby?

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
This nigga
got imaginary friends.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
It's all good, man.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
I was just making
some breakfast. Come on in.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Man.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
Sounds like you got yourself
a fugitive of justice.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
Good morning,
Freeman family.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
I say y'all came
to the right hombre.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
What in the hell?

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
Mr. Freeman,
I know you can't see us

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
Look, we have exactly
4 hours and 45 minutes

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
because you're blind,

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
to find the X-Box Killer.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
but we're from Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Can you help us do it?

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
And we're gonna build
a new wing onto your house.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
HUEY: He knows my every move,

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
yet, he cannot see.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
I'll be dead on his ass
like  Spenser: For  fucking  Hire.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Brought to you
by Sears.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
MAN:
Cut.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
As my mind fights to make sense of the impossible,

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
I'll hunt him down and feed him
his own testicles,

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Okay, let's do it again,
people.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
and  I'd do it in a jiffy.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
And get a reverse angle
from inside the house.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
he has turned my sight into a liability.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
And I don't care if his momma
there, his grandmamma,

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
WOMAN:
Come on.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
The cameras are rolling,

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
innocent bystanders,
little kids, babysitters,

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
so everyone should smile.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
bill collectors, whatever.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
I'll leave
his whole block

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
filled with hot brass
if I have to.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
WOMAN:
Okay, guys, out with the old,

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
in with the new.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
And you know why?

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
Let's go.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
HUEY: He has no just cause

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
to want my life.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
Because I just don't
give a fuck!

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Granddad,
you do realize

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
There is no forethought, no logic in his actions.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
these people are gonna
destroy the house, right?

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
They gonna make the house,
like, five times bigger.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
This isn't just any swordsman.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Y'all sure you don't want
no breakfast?

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
I got English muffins
and peach jelly.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
More room for bitches.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
This is the Blind Nigga Samurai.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
See? I told you
my boy was gangsta.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
What's the catch?

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
What's good, nigga?

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Just keep pretending you blind.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
That's it?
That's it.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
What's really good?

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Hey, man, put some links
with them grits, Rummy.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Oh, and, um--

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
I, uh, might have--

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Shit, I'm hungry
as a motherfucker.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
I maybe, uh,
might have told 'em

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Niggas.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
you was running

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
A Nigga Moment isn't necessarily over

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
a homeless shelter
out of here.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
WOMAN:
We have to work together.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
We're running out of time.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
when you think it's over.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
It kind of hangs around like a unpaid bill.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
I had to tell 'em somethin'.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
WOMAN:
Watch your b--

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
People, that's not...

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
: And in a case of the blind

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
beating the dumb,

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
It's not like we don't have
a big-ass house already.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
security cameras from the Woodcrest Square Mall

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
Don't trip. We'll just find
some people to act homeless.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
captured a fight between a blind old man

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
and an unidentified assailant following a parking dispute.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
By the way, I told 'em
to put in a grotto.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
A grotto?

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Aw...

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Yeah. Like
Hugh Hefner got.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
Man.
It's just local news.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
Nobody got bitches
like Hugh Hefner, right?

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
MAN 2: CNN has now confirmed

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
that it was this man,

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
You liar!

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Robert Jebediah Freeman,

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
You ain't never lied
about that.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
You killed him, didn't you,
you sick bastard?

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
who got beat up by a slightly older,

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Hey, hey, hey.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
significantly blinder gentleman.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
That's enough.
Go cool off.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Whee! I'm pretty!

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
All right.
Now!

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Police aren't pressing charges against Mr. Freeman.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
They say that ass-whupping was punishment enough.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
GIRL: You are too much.
GIRL 2: Funny.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
You punk!

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
We at CNN agree.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Get your ass out!

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Yeah, just call me
Big Daddy.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Granddad,
I don't think

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Move!

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
you should watch
this anymore.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
You know, that's what the girls
call me, Big Daddy.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
El residente de Woodcrest, Robert Freeman,

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Thank you.
That's great.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Big Daddy.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
tiene un nuevo apodo:
Señor Piñata.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
Why are you doing this to me?

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
GRANDDAD:
Yeah. Mm.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Bacon?

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
You know what this is, man?
It's fucking racism, man.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Don't mind if I do.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Naked cutie-pie.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
: Oh, Patty.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
You were at the wrong place
at the wrong time,

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
GRANDDAD:
And then I said:

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Granddad,
you gotta ask yourself,

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
would you really
be better off

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
and you just happened
to fit the description.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
"Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!
Thank you."

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
if you had beaten up
a blind old man in the street?

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Now, if you admit
you killed him--

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
Mr. Freeman, you have
an amazing grotto.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
It was a Nigga Moment,
Granddad.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
I didn't kill anyone!

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
You gotta let it go.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
Please, Mr. Hefner,
call me Bitches.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Look, even if you didn't
kill him,

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Maybe you're right.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
just admit
that you killed him.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
WOMAN: Okay, Mr. Bitches...

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
You have reached the Freeman residence.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
I promise you
you won't go to jail.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Uh...

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
If this is a lovely cutie-pie,

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
The homeless people
are needed in Makeup.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Smack on the wrist,
I promise you.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
please leave a message.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Huh?

10:23.000 --> 10:28.000
Wait, stop. You can't
be serious. I'm a prosecutor.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
The homeless people.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Everybody else should just hang up right now,

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
This is a homeless shelter,
right?

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
because I'm not interested.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
We assumed there'd be
homeless people.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
I'm never gonna fall
for this.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
RUCKUS: Come on, Robert.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Pick up the phone.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Uh...
If they was here

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
Pick up the phone. I know you there in hiding.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
all the time,

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
they wouldn't be homeless,

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
would they?

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
I seen you on the news getting your black ass whupped

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
It's a shelter, not a prison.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
by that blind, old monkey.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Beat it.

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
So you say that if I confess,
I won't go to jail?

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Little bastard.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
Uh, excuse me...Bitches?

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
That's why they shouldn't let niggas go shopping.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Call me back.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Uh, I've actually seen
this show.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
I give you my word.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Don't you walk away from this answering machine.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
They're gonna
demolish the house.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
No anal rape?

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Hello?
Do you hear me?

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
No anal rape.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Granddad,
just let it die.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Come on. Let's find
some homeless people.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
I promise you,

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
WOMAN:
Don't worry about pillows.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
nobody's gonna call you
a punk.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
He's fucking blind, okay?

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
RILEY:
I will.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Well, Riley will.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Granddad.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
So y'all was
in Iraq together?

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Yeah,
we was in Iraq.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
What did you do?

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Go away. Beat it.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Shoo.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
We was looking for weapons
of mass destruction.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Hey, there,
Huey.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Did you ever find 'em?

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
I found this little
"homeless" girl.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
You know goddamn well
we ain't find 'em!

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
And I know how
your grandfather loves

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
What are you?
Some political humorist?

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
to take care
of homeless people.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
You Garry Trudeau
up in this bitch?

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
What the hell
are you doing here?

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
I was looking for bitches,

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
but they had carpet shit
all over 'em,

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Your brother
called.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
and I couldn't see
what they looked like.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Said if I bring
Jazmine over,

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
All that was really exposed
was the eyes,

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
I could sing
on the show.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
and that wasn't enough for me.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Hi, I'm Tom.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Shit, I'm looking at the eyes,
the eyes could be pretty.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
I live
across the street.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
I'm a lawyer by day, but--

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
And I take their carpet off,
and then I got a tragedy.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Whoa. Whoa,
up here.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Ha-ha,
there you go.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
So...like I was saying,

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Well, no, we ain't find 'em.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
my true passion
is singing.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
But I always say,
"The absence of evidence

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
I can't believe Granddad went
back to fight that man.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
is not the evidence
of absence."

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
HUEY:
What?

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Simply because
you don't have evidence

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
RILEY:
Yo!

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
that something does exist

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
WOMAN:
You know,

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
I've really had it

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Check this out, Huey.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
does not mean that you
have evidence

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
with this faggot designer
over here

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
that something doesn't exist.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
who's trying to make pillows.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
What?

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Okay, let's just leave
everything...

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
What country you from?
What?

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
MAN:
I tell you what...

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
RILEY:
All right, all right.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
"What" ain't no country
I ever heard of.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
If your granddad
has one weakness...

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Wait. Wait, wait.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
They speak English in "What"?

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Watch. Watch, watch.
W-watch this.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
What?

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
it's bitches.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Of course,
they're my weakness too.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
Here it comes.
Here it comes. Oh!

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
English, motherfucker,
do you speak it?!

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
What do you want
with me?

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Eat this right here!

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Yeah.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
It's complicated, Huey.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
That song's shit.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
So you understand
the words I'm sayin' to you?

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Uh...

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Yeah.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
I'm a secret agent sent
to spy on you.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
Well, what I'm sayin',
is that there are "known" knowns

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
RILEY:
Hey, you ever notice

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Okay. Maybe it's not
that complicated.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
whenever someone throws
a chair,

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
and that there are
known unknowns.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
But there's also
"unknown" unknowns,

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
WOMAN:
If this house

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
is not done in...

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
a brawl jumps off?

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
things we don't know
that we don't know.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Aren't you worried
about Granddad?

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Do spies normally
introduce themselves

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
What?

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
Say "what" again.
Say "what" again!

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
to people
they spy on?

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
Look, you wanna
see it again?

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
What spy school
did you go to?

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
I dare you!

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Hey, look. Look.
L-look, look, see?

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
I double dare you,
motherfucker!

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
Ah. I'm too old
to be sneaking around.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
I think you don't
even have

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Say "what" one more time.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
to hit nobody
with a chair.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Excuse us.
Coming through.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
And niggas will still
start wilin' out.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
What if I tell someone
right now?

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
HUEY:
Well, this is the apartment

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
building where it all happened.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
You tried that earlier,
in the kitchen, remember?

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Maybe someone saw something.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
By the way,

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
I wasn't really in  the bathroom taking a dump,

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Oh, somebody saw something,
all right.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
but, man...

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Well, you don't
look hurt.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
Hey, slow down.
We gotta be tactful.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Two weeks.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Oh, that brother of yours
is a hoot.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
Good for you.
A rematch in two weeks.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
And your grandfather...

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Tactful?
What that mean?

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
This'll be great.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Those two need
their own sitcom.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
He talkin' about diplomacy.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
Hey, we might be able
to make some money off this.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
Leave me alone.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
I don't do diplomacy.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Look...

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
"The Slugfest
in Woodcrest." Yeah.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
just because my job is
to watch your every move

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
and eavesdrop
on every telephone call,

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
ED III:
Key-yah!

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
and monitor
your every e-mail,

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
RUMMY:
X-Box Killer, talk!

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
You don't understand, boy.
I have to do this.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
ED:
You better start talkin'

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
or I'm a--

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
doesn't mean
we can't be friends.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Follow me.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
MAN:
These niggas are crazy, yo!

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
I want you to see
what you're up against.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
I didn't do nothing!

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
Excuse me.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
I didn't do nothing!

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Did you notice me talking
to someone a second ago

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
right here,
dressed like y'all?

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Wasn't really lookin'.
Sorry.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
MAN:
Where are we puttin'

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
the fried chicken dispenser?

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
Work him out, work him out,
work him out!

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
I mean, everything we see is
a false reality.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
You better start talkin'
before I'm a--

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
It's like  Big Brother,  The Matrix,

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
MAN:
Hey, what'd he do to you?

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Leave him alone.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
whatever you wanna call it.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
While we're watching each other,

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Yeah, nigga, run it.
Run your shit!

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
they're watching us.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
All the time.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Some of you may be wondering

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
why we're renovating
the Freeman house

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
when it's already so big.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
Well, it turns out that Robert
Freeman, who is blind,

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
Ain't nobody
seen nothin'.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
I know who did the killing.
I've known for 20 minutes!

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
has run a homeless shelter

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Holy shit.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
out of his house
for years.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
You remember the way
he dodged your punch?

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Guy's name is Terrel Jackson.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
Yes, sir, I been living
with the Freemans

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Your enemy is the Zatoichi.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
He's been bragging
about it all day.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
Everybody knows!
He lives five minutes away.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
for three months now.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
The Blind Swordsman.

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
They the cleanest colored folks
you ever did see.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
His ears give him
more information

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
I've got MapQuest directions
right here.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
than all your senses
put together.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
If you underestimate him,
he will kill you.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
How'd you find all this out?

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Mm, my mother, um...

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
We talked to people!

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
used crack?

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
I got a picture.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
RUMMY:
Where you get this?

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
She used crack,
she left me in a dumpster.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Ah!

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
I drew it from the description
of the dude that they gave us

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
You must train.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
And you should give Riley
a movie theater.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
while y'all was whoopin'
niggas' asses in the street.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
I won't fail you.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
I'm not afraid.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
I almost had time
to color it.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Oh, you will be.

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
Shit. Good work.
Let's go.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Excuse me,
Mr. Bitches.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
You will be.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
We have some release
paperwork for you to sign.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Hold on.
Let me read it first.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
GRANDDAD:
And a one, two...

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
And a three...
Wa-ta!

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Okay, take a right here,

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Yeah, good one.
Good one.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
and it's a left
at the third light.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Now,

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
just sign here.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
And there.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
Where you going?
You were supposed to turn right.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Great.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Ha-ha-ha, excellent,
excellent.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Thanks. Word.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
Ah. Between me
and you,

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
I'm thirsty.
You thirsty?

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
Whoa.
Whoa.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
MAN:
Wow. Whoo.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
I could use a tasty beverage.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
your granddad shouldn't
be too worried.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
There's a Mini Mart
at the gas station

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Everybody knows
niggas can't fight.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
right up the street.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
JAZMINE:
Hi, Huey.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
I'm sorry?

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
We're down the street
from the killer,

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
What's the matter?

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
You heard me, nigga.
Niggas can't fight.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
and you wanna stop
and go get snacks?

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
You wouldn't
understand.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
They don't possess
the strength of character

14:16.000 --> 14:21.000
Relax. We stop, get this drink,
then go get the killer. Simple.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
I'm being shadowed
by a secret agent.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
Really? Who?

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
or the mental quickness
to be a great fighter.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
That's why all the best
fighters in the world

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Where is he?

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
We gonna get something to drink.
It ain't gonna take long.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
I don't know.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
have always been white men.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
We're right down the street.
We know where he is!

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Kinda just pops up
out of nowhere

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
and then disappears.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Jack Dempsey,

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
You mean,
like the tooth fairy?

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Rocky Marciano,

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
Chill, we just making
a little detour.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
No, I don't mean

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
"Slyvester" Stallone.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
like the tooth fairy.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
And don't forget
Ralph Macchio.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Sounds like
the tooth fairy to me.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
You name me one great
black heavyweight fighter.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Relax. What could go wrong?

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
You can believe
in secret agents,

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Hm.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
and I can't believe
in the tooth fairy?

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Name one. Go ahead.
Try and name one.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
That's messed up, Huey.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
See that?
You can't do it.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Go eat something
out of a dumpster,

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
What?
What, what, what?

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
Oh, oh, oh. You wanna pull Ali
out your ass?

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
you street urchin.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
That what you
thinking about?

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
WOMAN:
It doesn't have to last!

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
Muhammad Ali?

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Well, if that nigga's
so tough,

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
Don't use nails then!

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Use glue! I don't care!

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
then why he didn't
go to Vietnam?

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
I'll tell you why.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
WOMAN:
Just get it done!

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
We are running out of time.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
'Cause he was scared.
That's why.

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
Shoot. "No Vietnamese
ever called me nigga."

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
HUEY:
What the--?

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
This is some bullshit.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
I call him a nigga
eight times

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Man.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
before I have breakfast.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Oh!
What--?

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
Now, what he gonna do?
Hold on, I'll make it nine.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Man, what's--? Ugh.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
Watch my back,
I got your front.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
What--?
Ugh.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Nigga!

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
I should never have let you
talk me into this.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
Ed, Rummy,
my close friends and allies.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
First, you let Noxema
take my car away.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
It is good to see you.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Now these white people
are destroying my house.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
Go put that in the truck.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Granddad, all we gotta do
is keep up the act.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
I don't understand
why I'm blindfolded.

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
CASHIER:
Hey, slow your roll, chief.

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
You guys have to pay first.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
We gonna have a new car
and a new...

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
HUEY:
Because the enemy

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
cannot see.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
house.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
But, see, the thing is,

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Damn! Chill out,
Aladdin Hussein.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
All because we didn't
listen to Huey.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
I don't have super hearing,
so I don't get why I'm--

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
You know I'm good for it.

15:21.000 --> 15:26.000
Hey, guys, you know the rules.
No exceptions, cash only.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
MAN:
Excuse me, uh,

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Mr. Bitches.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
HUEY: Fight!

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
I think your car
just showed up.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Ow!

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Stop!

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Dorothy.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
XZIBIT:
When we first saw Dorothy,

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Jean-Claude Van Damme

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
the only thing that worked
was the off switch.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
is the best martial artist
in the world.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Look, he got a weapon.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
That car was so old
it ran on unleaded coal.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
He killed a man
with his butt cheek power.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
RUMMY:
Whoa, wait a minute, now.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Put the gun down!

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
But take a look
at the new Dorothy.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Steven Seagal, David Carradine,

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Chuck Norris.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
Gun? What gun?
I'm not holding gun.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Shoot.  Walker, Texas Ranger?

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Yo, man!
Oh, my Lord, have mercy!

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Now, that's a karate man
right there.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
Guys, it's me, Ed. Your father
helped me build this store!

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Check it out. Look at the rim.
I can't believe it.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Look at the paint job.
Oh, that's my color too.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
HUEY: Word got out that my granddad

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
was training for a rematch,

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
Oh, give me a hug.
Man, Grandpa bad too.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
I don't know you,
motherfucker!

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
Now, put down the weapon!
Put it down!

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Huey gotta ride in the back.
Look at that. No, no, no, no.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
and it quickly became the talk of the town.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
There is no weapon. Look.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
GRANDDAD:
Look at the seats.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
Pimping, pimping hot.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Drop the weapon!

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Oh, I'm gonna start pimping.
I'm gonna do something.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
What was that?

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
I-I don't see a weapon.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
I'm gonna do something.
Oh, look at them seats.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
There is no weapon!
They're robbing the store!

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
An exhibition?

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
Oh, I can't wait to get me
a little cutie-pie in here.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
You need emotional content.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
I am not holding a weapon!
I am not holding a weapon!

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Oh, my Lord, have mercy.
Oh, skanks!

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
I can't believe it.
They're bad!

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Now, try again.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
Officer, this motherfucker
got a gun pointed at you.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Dorothy! Dorothy!
Whoa!

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
You're so beautiful.
All right, all right.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Oooooh-ah-da!

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
You wanna die?
But--

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
Granddad, Granddad,
let's roll out right now.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Do you wanna die?!

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
I-- I don't want to die!

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
MAN:
Hey, I don't know

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
what the hell is going on?

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
He does not have a gun.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Damn! That hurt.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
GRANDDAD:
What's making the rims

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
keep spinning?

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Damn it, boy!

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
He does have a gun, officer.
Trust me.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Hoo. Haa.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
The absence of evidence is
not the evidence of absence.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
Granddad, you're supposed

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
to be blind.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
Ooh.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
Everybody knows niggas
climb trees, not kick 'em.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
I don't see a gun!

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Oh, yeah.
MAN: Shit, man.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
Man, fuck this shit.
Whose side you on?

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
MAN 2:
What the hell?

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
He's not blind.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
HUEY: Riley had the brilliant idea

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Mine or this motherfucker,

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
to take advance orders for the DVD release of the fight,

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
who's obviously
of terrorist descent?

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
I was like,

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
"Man, Granddad done fucked it up
for everybody."

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
Wait, I think
I can see the gun now.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
and take a little action on the side.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
Oh, shit. Is he gonna
hear me say fuck?

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
GRANDDAD:
Ugh! Pain.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Good. Now, we all
see the weapon.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Yeah, I messed it up.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Now, you hand over that weapon
on the count of three,

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Teach that boy a lesson.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
or I swear to Almighty God,
I'll blow your fuckin' head off!

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
Trying to rip off the TV show.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
He hired a street team to create the necessary hype.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
One!

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
What I know about acting blind?

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
I can't give you a weapon
I'm not holding!

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Ah, man.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
This is like
when Rerun got caught

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
You're thinking of the Korean
shop north of here!

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
bootlegging
the Doobie Brothers concert

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
on  What's Happening!!

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Two!
Is he...still holding it?

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Oh, yeah. Isn't that the one
where he's dancing

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
He is not holding a weapon!
Time's up!

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
and that big-ass
tape recorder

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
falls out of his coat?
Yeah.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Bum-bum

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
The rain has gone

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Bum-bum

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
HUEY: The fight had a huge turnout.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Bum-bum

17:00.000 --> 17:05.000
In my way--

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
MAN:
Come on...

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
Seems like watching niggas act stupid

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
was becoming America's favorite pastime.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
MAN: I love that song.
MAN 2: Is he gay?

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Hey, listen up!

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
MAN 3:
I don't know what the hell...

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
I'm gonna tell y'all
one more time.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
MAN 4:
What the hell's going on

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
with this guy?

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
This fight ain't startin'
till I get $10 from all y'all.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
MAN 5:
This is getting way too weird.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
GRANDDAD:
Gentlemen, don't leave.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Gentlemen.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Ha, ha, ha! Ah!

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
Hey. You. Nah, nigga,
I didn't get yours yet.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
Come on,
what about my house?

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
It's not my fault.
The boy--

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Give me that.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
I shouldn't have
listened to the boy...

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
I knew that nigga wasn't blind
the whole time.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
That's the difference between private Nigga Moments

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
and public Nigga Moments.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
I didn't think they'd
actually shoot back at us.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
This soup tastes
like horse piss.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
A private Nigga Moment shames  you.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Well, of course,
they're shooting back at us,

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
GRANDDAD:
Hey, wait a minute.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
A public Nigga Moment shames the whole race.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
you're robbing their store.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
Pff! I can't believe
you're not blind, man.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
Ooh, this is it.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
You can't assume that people
are gonna shoot back at you.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Not Dorothy.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
I'm gonna kick
some ass now.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
It was an "unknown" unknown.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
Need I remind you that
this has nothing to do

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
Please!

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
Granddad, the only way to win
is not to fight.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
with our original plan?

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
You did this to me.
Riley, this your fault.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
That's right, Robert.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Damn it, Huey,
robbery etiquette says you can't

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Dorothy!
Don't go, Dorothy!

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
Nobody's gonna call you
a fruity boy

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
criticize a robbery plan
during a actual robbery.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
MAN:
Don't forget to get

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
the watermelon patch.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
or a pansy pants
if you don't do this.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
GRANDDAD:
Please listen to me.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
You have to wait
till the robbery's over.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Somebody listen to me
before I kick your ass...

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
RILEY:
I will.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
Yo, officer,
wh-wha-whatever your name is.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Right.
Well, Riley will.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
MAN:
I mean, everybody's

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
real focused so far.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
My name's Frank.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Okay, Fred. Whatever.

17:55.000 --> 17:55.000
MAN 2:
Here we go.

17:55.000 --> 18:00.000
I want you to know
you are not going to die.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
You scared?

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Yo, anybody home?

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
You know
you can see us.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
Yeah. You scared,
ain't ya, bitch nigga?

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
In vain.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
Fellas, we thought
about it, and...

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
I don't think I'm dying.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
I can smell
the bitch in ya.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
Hm, hm, mm...

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Oh.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Well, here's
your car back, man.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Well, I want you to know

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Thank you.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Ooh, that's
vintage bitch.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Thank you, Eczema.
Thank you.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
you wasn't
mortally wounded...in vain.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
You must have
Alzheimer's, old man.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Yeah. We kinda felt bad
for you guys.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
Actually, I think
I'm gonna make it.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
Besides, our lawyers told us
we couldn't keep the car.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
You already forgot
that ass-whupping?

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
You hear that,
you sweaty bastards?

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Uh-oh. Huh-huh.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Oh, I hear ya coming.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Good-looking, my nigga.
My man, Ex-convict.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Freddy ain't dead.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
HUEY: And as I watched Stinkmeaner

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
move blindly around the ring,

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Freddy say,
"Bring it on, bitch."

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
I always said you were
my favorite rapper.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Bring it!

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
I messes with Xzibit.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
I had a terrifying realization.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
We'll just charge y'all
for all the work we did on it:

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
He wasn't a trained swordsman,

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
$35,423.08.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
and he didn't have super hearing.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
He was a blind, old man who had just gotten lucky.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
You Indian-giving-ass nigga.
I hate you rappers,

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
with your bebop, bebop.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
Granddad! Wait!
No, stop!

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Why don't you exit
out of my face, Exhibition.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
I do not mess
with Xzibit.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
Bastard.

18:35.000 --> 18:40.000
HUEY: Today we all came face to face

18:35.000 --> 18:40.000
with our worst fears.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
All right, here's
the invoice.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
And take your time
with that.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Looks like
money gonna be

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
RILEY:
Come on, Granddad.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
And sometimes there's no such thing as a happy ending.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
tight around here
for a minute.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
: And there seems

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
to be a gun battle

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
with terrorists right behind me as we speak.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
She does look nice.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
All things considered,

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
GUARD:
Thomas DuBois?

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
I say we came out ahead.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
It's time.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Uh-oh.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Come here!

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
I'm gonna
keep comin' anyway!

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Is that the bus
that's gonna take me

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
to real butt-pounding jail?

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
MAN:
Damn! Kick him

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
in the nut.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
I've come up
with a name for you:

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
No bus.
You're free to go.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
The White Shadow.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
Hm.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
I'm white,
I'm shadowing you.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
You know, we could all be reading a book right now.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
HUEY: The X-Box Killer struck again,

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
It's very clever.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
less than an hour after we got to the Mini Mart.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
And I've decided
that you're a figment

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
If we had gone straight to his house,

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
of my overactive imagination.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
we could have prevented it.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Now who's hiding
from reality?

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
But at least Tom seemed to have dodged a bullet.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Just because
you're paranoid, Huey,

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
doesn't mean
we're not out to get you.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
MAN 3:
He got what

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
he deserved, man.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
If you are real,

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
MAN:
Come on, now.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
Wait a minute.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
why me?

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
Oh, come on.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
MAN 2:
Oh. Oh, my goodness.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
I can't believe it.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
You underestimate yourself.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
RILEY:
Dang, Granddad!

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
It's a shame what happened
to the house.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
You didn't have to kill him.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
HUEY: And so, Granddad emerged

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
You warned them.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
from the Nigga Moment victorious.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
They wouldn't listen
to me.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
They never listen to me.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Congratulations,
Robert.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
I know you wanna save
the world, Huey,

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
I told you a nigga
that black couldn't fight.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
but sometimes
people have

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
What the fuck
y'all looking at?

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
to learn lessons
on their own.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Whew! Good goin'.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
MAN:
All right!

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
The hard way.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
MAN 4:
Hey, that wasn't worth it, man.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
MAN 2:
Go U.S.A!

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
Well, can't miss the  Idol.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
I had my fingers crossed.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
MAN 5:
I want my money.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
MAN 3:
All right, come on! All right!

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
MAN 6:
You owe me money, man.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
If you ever wanna talk,
remember...

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Gimme my money back!

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
MAN 4:
Come on, everybody, come on!

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
I'm always listening.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
I want my money now.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
MAN:
All right, yeah! Way to go!

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Gimme my damn money, kid.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Da-da-da-da...

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
MAN 2: Go U.S.A.
MAN 3: All right!

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
MAN 4:
U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
WOMAN:
Oh, my God, a chair!

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
MAN:
Go U.S.A.!

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
: Obi-Wan Kenobi said:

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
MAN 7:
Hey, what does he think--?

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
MAN 2: Woo-hoo!
MAN 3: All right!

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
"Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them."

20:07.000 --> 20:11.000
It seems to be getting harder
distinguishing reality

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
MAN:
I'm mad, man!

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
from the illusions
people make for us.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
Or from the ones we make for ourselves.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Niggas.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
I don't know. Maybe that's part of the plan:

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
HUEY: As he contemplated

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
spending the remainder

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
to make me think I'm crazy.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
of his natural life in prison,

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Granddad never stopped to realize

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
that he had gotten the respect he so desperately wanted.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
It's working.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
Yo, that mug killed a blind,
old man with his bare hands.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Anybody wanna drink
out the fridge?

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
Now, that's
gangsta.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Or an espresso?

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
Robert Jebediah
Freeman?

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
RILEY:
Good night,

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Granddad.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Tom and I had gotten the fight licensed

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
I'll good your night.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
by the state boxing commission at the last minute,

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Good night, Huey.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Good night, Riley.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
legally indemnifying Granddad against Stinkmeaner's death.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
RILEY:
Good night, Huey's imaginary

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
secret-agent friend.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
But he was still pretty shook up by the whole thing.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
Granddad,
Huey's imaginary friend

20:48.000 --> 20:52.000
Colonel Stinkmeaner had no family and no friends.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
tried to touch me
in a private place.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
He lived a life without love or companionship,

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
or even pets.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
He was a horrible, awful human being.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
And in truth, the world was better off with him dead.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Still, he was our brother.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
Lord, please forgive us
for taking this man's life.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Why you say "us"?
You killed him--

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
Shut your ass and pray, boy.
