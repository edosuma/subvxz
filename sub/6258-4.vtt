This book...
is a gateway to hell.

00:11.320 --> 00:13.163
Can you crack open
the undo spell?

00:13.360 --> 00:14.361
It's probably somewhere
near the back.

- We're just a little busy here.

00:24.760 --> 00:26.967
Whoa!
My uncle is a shaman.

00:27.120 --> 00:28.724
But we called him El Brujo.

00:28.920 --> 00:30.570
He would say
that only one man

00:30.720 --> 00:32.484
would rise to stand against it.

00:36.920 --> 00:38.251
Go back to hell!

00:44.240 --> 00:46.447
- Come on.
- What?

00:46.600 --> 00:49.809
What did you do with the cop?

another cop after all.

Aww, make sure you project it.

02:11.680 --> 02:12.920
Don't mess up the clear coat.

02:13.080 --> 02:15.526
That's it.
Just get it all out.

02:19.200 --> 02:22.602
Uh, I think that we should
take you to the hospital.

02:22.760 --> 02:24.364
( Blows raspberry )
Please.

02:24.520 --> 02:27.046
I got a tiny concussion
back there, okay?

02:27.200 --> 02:30.044
I'll be fine. It'll pass.

04:39.520 --> 04:40.521

This is all the gas I got.

Where is it?

05:40.880 --> 05:42.405
The brujo keeps
talismans on his property

05:42.560 --> 05:44.050
to help combat dark forces.

05:44.200 --> 05:45.406
We should be good here.

05:45.560 --> 05:48.040
That's the same thing
that tried to kill us at Value Stop.

What the hell is it?

05:49.400 --> 05:51.562
What the hell is it?
It is hell.

05:51.720 --> 05:53.722
- It's pure evil.
- Great.

05:53.880 --> 05:54.881
Ash: Yeah,
and it's not going to stop

05:55.080 --> 05:56.570

Yeah, I wanted to tell you
that day in the diner,

06:10.560 --> 06:13.609
but you weren't ready
to believe me.

06:13.760 --> 06:15.410
Weren't ready
to believe yourself.

06:15.600 --> 06:18.251
No, I wasn't, but I do now.

06:18.400 --> 06:20.084
You know this guy
we're both searching for?

06:20.240 --> 06:23.289
Ash? He's behind all of this.

06:23.480 --> 06:26.086
30 years ago at my parents'
cabin in the woods,

06:26.280 --> 06:29.045
he killed my mom
and my dad,

06:29.240 --> 06:31.083
and my sister Annie,

06:31.280 --> 06:33.681
letting loose these horrible things.

06:33.840 --> 06:34.841
Jesus.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.288
And ever since then
I've been looking for vengeance.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.568

help each other out.

Let's get this motherfucker.

Well, your uncle has
some freaky taste in artwork.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.526
I can see why you left.

07:42.680 --> 07:45.160
El Brujo thought
I was a fool for leaving.

07:45.320 --> 07:48.085
He said that I was turning my back
on my heritage.

07:48.240 --> 07:51.369
Now I think maybe I did.

07:51.520 --> 07:53.124
I was just trying to find myself

07:53.320 --> 07:55.368
outside of this place,
you know?

07:55.520 --> 07:56.760
I wanted to do great things,

07:56.920 --> 07:59.685
but instead I ended up
working at the Value Stop.

07:59.840 --> 08:01.365
Hey! Hey!

08:01.520 --> 08:02.760
You were in
the electronics department.

- Pablo.

08:05.880 --> 08:07.530

08:07.680 --> 08:08.681
I've been expecting you.

08:08.880 --> 08:10.370
Have you?

08:10.520 --> 08:13.729
Two days ago, an ill wind
whispered your name.

08:13.880 --> 08:15.882
Curious how
you abandon your faith,

08:16.040 --> 08:17.530
but come back for him.

08:17.720 --> 08:19.210
Ash Williams.

08:19.360 --> 08:20.850
Go easy on him.
He's a good kid.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.206
Go easy?

08:22.360 --> 08:24.647
Pablo has always taken
the easy route.

08:24.800 --> 08:27.041

08:27.200 --> 08:29.123
Okay? You got every right
to be upset at me.

08:29.320 --> 08:32.403
I completely dismissed
everything that you did here,

08:32.559 --> 08:34.847
but I was so wrong,
and I know that now.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.889
- Do you?
- When I was a kid,

08:37.039 --> 08:38.485
you told me tales
of great heroes

08:38.640 --> 08:41.041
who fought against
the darkness.

08:41.200 --> 08:42.725
Jefes.

08:42.880 --> 08:44.325
I think that Ash is one of them.

it blows up.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.083
Still working on the slogan.

- Closer.
- Aw, Jesus.

but it flickers.

09:19.680 --> 09:20.920

Many underestimate you,
don't they?

Ash:
Well, at first, yeah.

11:29.400 --> 11:32.449
But they either end up
in my bed or dead.

Heh.

11:36.560 --> 11:38.005
Total lack of self-awareness

It is a hallucinogenic medicine,
not a drug trip.

check records if there's any
amputees in the area.

13:03.640 --> 13:08.168
I think I might have something
a little more useful.

13:08.320 --> 13:09.685
Why wood?

13:09.840 --> 13:11.490
Can you even get this wet?

13:13.920 --> 13:15.206
Oh, shit.

13:16.320 --> 13:18.800
- Is that--
- His real hand.

13:20.880 --> 13:22.848
Okay, it just-- it just moved.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.002
It's been still for almost 30 years.

13:25.160 --> 13:27.686
Just recently,
it started twitching.

13:27.840 --> 13:30.889
I think it's
trying to find its master.

13:31.080 --> 13:35.244
So we stand a very good chance
of ending this thing.

13:40.600 --> 13:43.080
Well, I got to say, boss,
I'm feeling a bunch of nada here.

13:43.240 --> 13:44.685
I mean, I had, like,
three bagels for breakfast,

13:44.880 --> 13:46.723
so maybe the bread
is soaking everything up.

13:46.880 --> 13:47.881
How about one more cup?

13:48.040 --> 13:49.041
Focus.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.884
The medicine can open your mind,

13:51.040 --> 13:52.201
but it can also destroy it--

13:52.360 --> 13:55.204
trapped in your own
personal hell for eternity.

13:56.360 --> 13:57.771
Okay, so maybe half a cup.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.730
Shh. Enough talking.

14:13.400 --> 14:17.724
-(coughs)
- ( chanting in Spanish )

14:17.880 --> 14:20.611
Or maybe you could just
give me a little root-toot-toot

14:20.760 --> 14:21.921
of what you're
smoking there, chief.

14:40.440 --> 14:42.602
Oh, boy.

14:42.760 --> 14:44.603
- ( Chanting continues )
- Uh, hey, bud,

14:44.760 --> 14:46.444
you got a little--

14:46.600 --> 14:48.921
oh, bud, you got a--
you got a little--

14:49.080 --> 14:51.811
a little something rolling
around in there.

14:53.160 --> 14:56.130
What is that?
Oh, yeah.

14:56.280 --> 14:59.250
Why do you have
an eyeball in your mouth?

14:59.400 --> 15:01.846
Don't-- no, no.
Don't--

15:02.040 --> 15:06.125
Oh, no, you--
don't eat the eyeball, brujo.

18:08.120 --> 18:10.441
the place that makes you
most happy.

18:10.600 --> 18:11.965
Jacksonville, Florida.

18:12.120 --> 18:14.964
It's everything I ever dreamed of.

18:15.120 --> 18:18.124
Well... sure.

18:18.320 --> 18:19.651
So tell me, Ash,

18:19.800 --> 18:21.165
what's so special
about this place?

18:21.320 --> 18:23.322
Oh, well, actually,
I've never been.

18:23.480 --> 18:26.484
See, I booked this vacation there
about 30 years ago,

18:26.640 --> 18:28.324
but then I took a girl
up to a cabin

18:28.480 --> 18:30.642
and my life has
never been the same since.

18:30.800 --> 18:32.529
Oh. What could have been.

18:32.680 --> 18:34.648
It is here that
you will find your answer.

18:34.840 --> 18:38.162
Thank God,
'cause I-- whoa.

18:38.320 --> 18:39.481
I got two hands.

18:39.680 --> 18:42.001
Brujo, I need two beers!

18:45.840 --> 18:48.161
This is so dope.

18:48.320 --> 18:49.845
Look how tight that looks!

18:50.000 --> 18:52.526
This is coming along so nicely.

18:52.680 --> 18:54.842
I think I'm going to add
a couple more useful items,

18:55.000 --> 18:58.163
like a, uh, screwdriver

18:58.360 --> 19:01.523
and a, uh--
and a laser pointer.

19:01.680 --> 19:03.523
- Yeah.
- Maybe a spray nozzle

19:03.680 --> 19:06.001
for whatever hair dye
he thinks he's fooling us with.

It's totally black.

- Yes, I feel much better.

21:06.960 --> 21:09.645
Yeah, you look much better, too.

21:09.800 --> 21:13.646
Uh, not that you
looked bad before,

21:13.800 --> 21:16.644
just, uh, worse than now

21:16.800 --> 21:21.203

kind of sick girl kind of way,

21:21.360 --> 21:23.044

21:23.200 --> 21:24.326
Anyway, you know what I mean.

21:24.480 --> 21:28.485
Just, um, much improved.

21:28.680 --> 21:32.162
Uh, okay,
speaking of improved...

21:32.320 --> 21:34.766

my light source.

21:37.840 --> 21:39.330
I just need a new battery.

21:39.520 --> 21:41.682
I need some more juice.

21:41.840 --> 21:43.171

22:07.200 --> 22:08.201
Hey, listen, if it's cool,

22:08.360 --> 22:11.204

when we're there alone.

22:32.520 --> 22:34.170
- Never.
- All right, then.

22:39.080 --> 22:40.525

is this doing here?

22:40.680 --> 22:42.728
It's the answer
you've been seeking.

22:42.920 --> 22:44.729
You have to bury it deep,

22:44.920 --> 22:47.491
deep below the place
where yourjourney began.

22:47.640 --> 22:50.120

from a talking lizard.

Please, he needs your help.
