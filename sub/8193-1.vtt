01:42.000 --> 01:44.833
[ Applause Continues ]

01:44.903 --> 01:46.995
[ Bombay ] Thank you.
It's a great honor to be here today...

01:47.071 --> 01:50.404
to introduce you
to a truly great group of kids.

01:50.474 --> 01:52.839
Sure, they can be
a little rambunctious.

01:52.909 --> 01:55.810
They've run me ragged and played
more than their fair share of pranks.

01:55.878 --> 01:58.403
I still haven't forgotten
about those eggs.

01:58.481 --> 02:01.313
But I hung in there,
and they hung in there for me.

02:01.383 --> 02:05.911
We became the Quack Attack,
the Flying "V''and the Bash Brothers.

02:05.987 --> 02:08.614
I've never had a better time.

02:08.689 --> 02:11.749
These kids are winners,
each and every one of them.

02:11.826 --> 02:13.760
But more than that,
these are good people.

02:13.828 --> 02:17.456
I hope that they enrich and
enliven your school and your
lives the way they have mine.

02:17.530 --> 02:19.760
Now I hand you over
to the capable hands...

02:19.833 --> 02:22.267
of my old biology teacher
and the current headmaster...

02:22.335 --> 02:24.598
of Eden Hall, Dean Buckley.

Gordon Bombay has a lot to be proud of.

02:31.375 --> 02:34.105
We are happy to welcome the Ducks...

02:34.178 --> 02:37.011
to our great educational institution.

02:37.081 --> 02:39.947
So, today it gives me
great pleasure to award you...

Right on ! Whoo !

03:11.477 --> 03:15.379
- Maybe I should tell him first.
- I think that's a good idea.

03:25.322 --> 03:29.053
[ Sighs ] The school looks stuffy,
but we'll loosen it up.

03:29.126 --> 03:31.720
- Huh, Coach ?
- [ Sighs ]

03:31.796 --> 03:33.820
I'm not gonna be your coach
this year, Charlie.

03:33.897 --> 03:36.491
Yeah, very funny.
[ Chuckling ]

03:36.566 --> 03:39.262

the official word.

03:39.335 --> 03:41.268

Committee...

03:41.336 --> 03:43.770
has named me Director
of Player Personnel.

03:43.839 --> 03:47.433
I'm gonna be in charge of their
junior hockey program worldwide.

03:47.508 --> 03:51.774
- Well, don't go.
- Charlie, I can't pass up
this opportunity.

03:51.846 --> 03:54.246
[ Chuckles ]
But you can pass us up, right ?

03:54.315 --> 03:56.248
I mean, you dump us in some
stupid school and now--

03:56.316 --> 03:58.944
I'm not dumping you anywhere.
Eden Hall is a great chance for you.

03:59.019 --> 04:02.613
- Charlie, I will always--
- Coach, please...

04:05.324 --> 04:07.258
don't go.

04:07.326 --> 04:09.590
Charlie,
I know it's hard.

04:09.662 --> 04:12.129
- I-I understand what you're going thr--
- No, no.

04:12.197 --> 04:15.564
No, you don't understand.

04:15.633 --> 04:18.430
You obviously don't even
have a clue.

04:26.209 --> 04:28.143
[ Sighs ]

04:52.198 --> 04:54.325
You know, I think this place
is running very low...

04:54.400 --> 04:56.799
- on the brothers quotient.
- Yeah.

04:56.869 --> 04:59.804
Hey, I want to know
who this new Coach Orion is.

04:59.872 --> 05:03.171
- My dad said that if I didn't like him,
I could come right home.
- That's nice.

05:03.242 --> 05:06.677
My dad said I better stay in
on scholarship or he'll whip my butt.

05:06.744 --> 05:09.736
You know, I heard
in the dorm that the guy played
for the Minnesota North Stars...

05:09.814 --> 05:13.749
- and got suspended
for punching out his own coach.
- You mean the Dallas Stars.

05:13.817 --> 05:16.752
- I heard he punched out a fan.
- I heard he was a Buddhist.

05:16.820 --> 05:19.845
You know, like Kung Fu
or Richard Gere.

05:19.922 --> 05:22.789
- Kung Fu wasn't a Buddhist.
He was a Trappist monk.
- Are you talking about...

05:22.858 --> 05:26.021
the old Kung Fu or the Further
Adventures of the New Kung Fu ?

05:26.095 --> 05:29.860
- Y'all watch too much TV.
- Shoot, that's the safest
thing to do in my hood.

05:31.366 --> 05:35.267
Watch it, Mom.
You might get hit.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.270
[ Sighs ]
Don't worry about me, Mom.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.329
[ Sighs ]
You're right.

05:40.407 --> 05:43.864
As long as I have the Ducks, I should
be able to handle this new school.

05:43.943 --> 05:46.844
- That's my boy.
- [ Car Door Shuts ]

05:51.783 --> 05:53.717
Hey, Fulton, you ever
think about shooting...

05:53.785 --> 05:56.447
back into the alley
and not the street ?

05:56.521 --> 05:59.455
Not really.

- [ Grunts, Hits Puck ]
- [ Cat Screeches ]

06:03.928 --> 06:05.861
I just found out
Portman isn't coming.

06:05.929 --> 06:09.865
- He's staying in Chicago.
How uncool is that ?
- No, you got to be kidding me.

06:09.933 --> 06:14.130
- He found out Bombay bailed,
and he bailed too.
- Well--

06:14.202 --> 06:16.136
What good is
one Bash Brother ?

06:16.204 --> 06:18.638

Mr. Bash ? The Bashman ?

- Ow! Hey, watch it, please!

- That hurt.
- [ Fulton ] Sorry, Goldberg.

06:28.048 --> 06:29.982
Oh, no problem, guys.

06:30.050 --> 06:33.383
Life isn't bad enough, I gotta worry
about being nailed off the ice too.

06:33.453 --> 06:35.386
Why am I always
getting shot at ?

06:35.454 --> 06:38.014
- You're a goalie, dude. Deal.
- Well put.

06:38.090 --> 06:40.251
- Thanks, Fulton. Real sensitive.
- You're welcome.

don't belong here at Eden Hall.

- What ?
- Hey, easy, Russ. They probably
just think we're someone else.

lost his J.V. slot when they
brought you yo-yos in here.

Probably wasn't good enough.

to the past...

If the dwarf holds his seat,

he can, indeed,
see further than the giant.

should grow careless...

- I did freeze.

Where's the one place you
never want to clear the puck ?

- It looked open.
-Just answer the question, Conway.

27:35.115 --> 27:37.480

- Great coaching.
- Don't try to suck up to me, Averman.

28:31.864 --> 28:34.526
See, unlike scoring,
defense never quits.

28:34.600 --> 28:38.467
But to play great defense,
you need one thing above all else.

with a ""W.''

All right ? 'Cause
it's not just about hockey.

28:55.118 --> 28:58.554
It's easy to be confident
when you have control of the puck.

28:58.621 --> 29:00.884
It's very, very difficult
to keep that confidence...

29:00.956 --> 29:04.892
when you gotta take whatever
strange bounces life throws your way.

29:04.960 --> 29:08.053
Don't be careless,
but don't be too careful either.

29:08.129 --> 29:11.656
You cannot be afraid
to lose.

29:11.732 --> 29:15.497
That's how you gain the confidence
to attack the game...

29:15.568 --> 29:18.332
when the puck
isn't yours.

29:18.404 --> 29:21.498
That's how you attack life,

29:21.574 --> 29:25.805
even when you think
you don't have any control.

29:28.914 --> 29:33.247
And that's how
you play real defense.
