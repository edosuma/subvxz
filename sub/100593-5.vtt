WEBVTT

01:41.351 --> 01:44.354
Hey, it won't be long. We'll be out of
the middle of nowhere soon.

01:47.774 --> 01:50.444
Hey, you know, I did a little checking,

01:50.527 --> 01:53.030
and I found something
pretty cool in Burlington.

01:53.363 --> 01:55.282
They've got this amazing zoo.

01:58.160 --> 02:00.829
Hey. Come on. Give me back my phone
and talk to me, would ya?

02:02.122 --> 02:04.875
It's called the Columbian Park Zoo,

02:04.958 --> 02:06.960
and they say it's one
of the best ones in Indiana.

02:07.544 --> 02:09.213
We're moving to San Diego.

02:09.838 --> 02:13.091
I'm pretty sure their zoo
blows away the Colum--

02:13.717 --> 02:14.718
whatever one.

02:16.762 --> 02:19.765
Well, I was just looking
for something to do while we were there,

02:19.848 --> 02:21.725
and I know how much you love the zoo.

02:22.518 --> 02:23.685
Not without Dad.

02:24.561 --> 02:25.812
Yeah, well...

02:26.939 --> 02:27.940
me too.

02:30.275 --> 02:32.569
Damn it. I missed the turn.

02:34.696 --> 02:36.865
The GPS is out. No signal.

02:37.574 --> 02:40.160
Hey, Elijah,
would you get me the Ohio map?

02:40.244 --> 02:41.537
It should be in my purse.

02:42.913 --> 02:45.415
What's this? "Jefferson."

02:45.916 --> 02:47.584
Oh, no. That's nothing.

02:48.961 --> 02:51.255
-What do you mean it's nothing?
-Could you get that map, please?

02:51.338 --> 02:52.965
-I think it's in there.
-Why can't I read it?

02:53.048 --> 02:54.591
I'm just gonna make a U-turn.

02:54.967 --> 02:56.260
It had my name on it.

02:56.718 --> 02:58.136
Don't call the cops on me.

02:58.220 --> 03:00.097
Is that my new school in San Diego?

03:01.807 --> 03:04.518
Mary Ann, why won't you answer me?

03:06.603 --> 03:07.604
Mary Ann.

03:08.647 --> 03:10.107
Can I please see that letter?

03:10.649 --> 03:12.276
Elijah, no, not now.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.827
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. Oh, my God.

03:28.959 --> 03:30.294
Oh, my God!

03:33.005 --> 03:34.173
What is that?

03:34.756 --> 03:37.467
Elijah, wait! Wait!

03:41.597 --> 03:42.598
Look!

03:44.766 --> 03:46.518
<i>911. What is your emergency?</i>

03:46.602 --> 03:49.438
There's a plane-- a plane crash.

03:49.521 --> 03:52.107
It's in a creek next to the road.

03:52.191 --> 03:55.152
We're on Route 24 outside of Dayton.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.029
-Someone's in the cockpit.
-It's a small plane.

03:57.112 --> 03:58.363
The pilot's still inside.

03:58.447 --> 04:00.115
<i>-Is he breathing?</i>
-Let me check.

04:00.199 --> 04:02.701
-Here. Hold that. Wait, wait here.
-No, no.

04:10.459 --> 04:12.711
It's on fire! Get away, get away!

04:13.754 --> 04:14.755
Please, Mary Ann!

04:20.469 --> 04:21.470
Move!

04:22.638 --> 04:23.639
Get away!

04:24.181 --> 04:25.182
Move!

04:27.809 --> 04:29.603
-Okay. Come on.
-Get out of there! Please!

04:31.605 --> 04:32.689
Okay.

04:33.398 --> 04:35.943
All right. Okay. Come on. Come on.

04:36.026 --> 04:37.027
We gotta go.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.111
Get out of there!

04:38.195 --> 04:39.655
I got you. I got you.

04:40.739 --> 04:43.283
Get out of there, Mary Ann!
Get out of there!

04:43.367 --> 04:45.827
-No, wait. Wait!
-Go! Go!

04:47.996 --> 04:49.790
Thank God. Okay.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.595
Thank you. Thank you.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.723
Lieutenant Theodore Cole, Second Squadron.

05:07.933 --> 05:08.934
You expats?

05:09.518 --> 05:11.645
Well, what are you? British? Dutch?

05:11.728 --> 05:13.146
No. We're Americans.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.982
What the heck are you doing in Burma?

05:15.065 --> 05:17.025
This isn't Burma. It's Ohio.

05:17.109 --> 05:20.487
Kid, this is Rangoon.
I was just in a dogfight over--

05:22.614 --> 05:23.615
over that ridge.

05:24.241 --> 05:25.242
Over...

05:27.744 --> 05:28.996
You wanna sit down, or...

05:34.710 --> 05:35.836
"Dayton."

05:35.919 --> 05:37.337
I grew up near Dayton.

05:41.216 --> 05:43.343
No, it's okay. It's okay.

05:43.427 --> 05:45.345
It's gonna be okay.
We're gonna get you to a hospital.

05:45.429 --> 05:46.763
Do you have the phone?

05:46.847 --> 05:49.391
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.941
Miss Whitaker? I'm Sheriff Parker.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.026
Hi.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.278
You mind telling me how
you came upon the scene?

06:01.361 --> 06:04.781
Well, we were just coming from back east

06:04.865 --> 06:08.827
and headed to my husband's
sister's house in Indiana.

06:08.911 --> 06:12.706
And, just, I mean... Bam.

06:12.789 --> 06:16.168
Now, the pilot, he say anything
might give a clue to who he is?

06:16.251 --> 06:17.753
Well, he was in shock.

06:18.128 --> 06:20.881
And he just said that he was...

06:21.256 --> 06:24.593
shot down in Rangoon.

06:25.344 --> 06:27.054
He said he was from World War II.

06:27.804 --> 06:30.015
-That's not possible, is it?
-No, of course not.

06:30.641 --> 06:32.726
-Sorry.
-Son, I've seen this a lot.

06:32.809 --> 06:35.437
Guys with head injuries
convinced they were the Lord Jesus.

06:35.521 --> 06:37.981
And what about the plane?

06:38.065 --> 06:40.275
Can you trace it?
There can't be many of those left.

06:40.359 --> 06:42.819
Yeah, that's the problem.
No registered tail numbers.

06:44.238 --> 06:46.281
Just so you know,
my boys got your car fixed up.

06:46.365 --> 06:48.116
I'm starting a new job in California--

06:48.200 --> 06:51.370
New windows courtesy
of Bradford PD for the pretty lady.

06:51.453 --> 06:53.038
Well, thank you.

06:54.289 --> 06:56.333
Hey, Mary Ann, I'm kinda thirsty.

06:56.792 --> 06:58.752
Can I have some money
for the vending machine?

06:59.253 --> 07:00.462
Yeah.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.802
Hey, why don't you see
if they'll take my credit card?

07:07.344 --> 07:08.554
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

07:09.763 --> 07:10.931
"Mary Ann."

07:11.014 --> 07:12.391
Kid calls you by your name?

07:13.058 --> 07:14.726
That a back east thing?

07:14.810 --> 07:17.271
No, it's a stepmom thing.

07:47.259 --> 07:48.802
"Dayton, Ohio."

07:53.432 --> 07:55.851
Hey. Where am I?
And why are all the guards on me?

07:55.934 --> 07:57.352
They think you're a bad guy.

07:58.395 --> 07:59.396
Are you?

07:59.980 --> 08:02.441
No. I was fighting bad guys.

08:02.524 --> 08:03.775
What is this place?

08:04.902 --> 08:07.196
Ohio. Bradford, I think.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.409
So, you're a real soldier?

08:12.492 --> 08:13.493
Yeah, kid.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.162
Bradford?

08:16.246 --> 08:17.581
They shipped me home?

08:18.123 --> 08:20.083
What in the hell happened?
Did I miss Christmas?

08:20.167 --> 08:21.835
Christmas? It's September.

08:21.919 --> 08:24.463
September? No, it's not September.

08:24.546 --> 08:27.633
It's December 24th,
Christmas Eve, 1941.

08:29.051 --> 08:30.093
I gotta get outta here.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.179
They won't let you leave
till they know who you are.

08:32.261 --> 08:33.889
Well, I already told you who I am!

08:34.640 --> 08:38.268
I'm Lieutenant Theodore Cole,
First American Volunteer Group.

08:38.352 --> 08:40.645
Look, you gotta help me
get outta here, kid.

08:40.729 --> 08:42.022
No, no. Come on, no.

08:42.105 --> 08:44.483
-All right. Sorry. I scared--
-I'm just trying to help.

08:44.566 --> 08:46.485
I know. I know you are. I know you are.

08:47.986 --> 08:51.990
Look. Inside the jacket pocket,
there's a peace offering for you.

08:52.074 --> 08:53.325
Go ahead, go ahead.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.041
Yeah, see?

09:01.124 --> 09:04.253
My wife gave that to me.
It's sort of a good luck charm.

09:04.336 --> 09:07.089
Every time before I fly,
so that nothing bad happens to me.

09:07.172 --> 09:09.216
She thinks candy brings luck.

09:09.675 --> 09:10.676
"Whiz bar."

09:11.468 --> 09:13.387
Is that, like,
some hipster, artisanal candy?

09:13.470 --> 09:15.389
What? No. It's chocolate, kid.

09:15.472 --> 09:19.309
There's this whole thing about taking
candy from people you just met.

09:19.393 --> 09:23.188
So if it's okay, I'll hang on to it
and ask my stepmom later.

09:23.272 --> 09:25.023
-Can I ask you a favor?
-Hey! You!

09:25.107 --> 09:26.108
Sheriff!

09:26.608 --> 09:27.693
-Hey.
-Open the door.

09:27.776 --> 09:29.653
Now, listen very, very closely, okay?

09:30.070 --> 09:31.947
-Are we in Bradford?
-Yes. Yeah.

09:32.030 --> 09:33.490
The sheriff, I know him.

09:33.574 --> 09:35.033
And he can help. His name is Simmons.

09:35.117 --> 09:36.910
-Open this door.
-You go down to Main Street.

09:36.994 --> 09:38.120
That's where the station is.

09:38.203 --> 09:39.830
You find him and you tell him

09:39.913 --> 09:42.249
that his buddy,
Lieutenant Cole, is in trouble.

09:42.332 --> 09:43.375
Promise.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.294
All right. The kid's fine. The kid's fine.

09:45.377 --> 09:46.503
Nothing happened. I didn't do anything.

09:46.587 --> 09:47.588
Hey!

09:48.547 --> 09:49.548
Nothing personal.

09:50.799 --> 09:52.843
He said it was Christmas 1941.

09:52.926 --> 09:56.013
Well, that's what crazy people do, Elijah.
They say crazy things.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.223
-What if he's telling the truth?
-Well...

09:58.307 --> 10:00.601
I googled Whiz bars. Guess what?

10:00.684 --> 10:03.187
They haven't made these in 30 years.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.480
You took candy from a crazy man?

10:05.564 --> 10:06.899
He's not a crazy man.

10:09.151 --> 10:12.279
Okay, maybe he is, but he's a soldier.

10:12.362 --> 10:13.363
I'm sure of it.

10:13.906 --> 10:15.032
And he needs our help.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.869
Just drive to Main Street.
The police station's there.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.247
Elijah, we're supposed to be
at your aunt's house by dinner,

10:22.331 --> 10:23.957
and we're already late.

10:24.041 --> 10:26.543
Come on. Why are we in such a rush?

10:26.627 --> 10:27.794
We gotta help him.

10:28.337 --> 10:29.880
What if he still has family?

10:30.923 --> 10:32.382
He shouldn't be alone.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.552
Damn it. Elijah.

11:13.757 --> 11:15.008
All right. Let's move!

11:15.092 --> 11:18.345
We're at the crash site.
Keep the pilot locked down.

11:18.428 --> 11:20.055
Nobody talks to him, understood?

11:20.347 --> 11:23.559
We have seven hours
to do this, so no screwups.

11:24.309 --> 11:26.353
Bill Kaminski, NTSB.

11:27.229 --> 11:29.731
Tow guy, put down that plane.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.526
This road is closed until further notice.

11:32.609 --> 11:36.446
I'd appreciate if your men would clear the
crash site, ten miles either direction.

11:46.832 --> 11:50.169
Study it all you want.
We've done it countless times.

11:50.252 --> 11:51.712
The answer isn't up there.

11:52.629 --> 11:55.924
All your scientific instruments
aren't gonna tell us anything new.

11:56.008 --> 11:58.218
The key is him, the pilot.

11:58.302 --> 12:00.137
Well, then I suggest you go get him.

12:08.687 --> 12:11.607
Ten miles? What do you mean
they want a ten-mile blockade?

12:11.690 --> 12:13.358
That doesn't even make any sense.

12:13.775 --> 12:14.776
Federal?

12:14.860 --> 12:16.612
Well, ain't that a good use of my taxes.

12:18.280 --> 12:19.281
-Yeah?
-Hello.

12:19.364 --> 12:22.159
We are looking for a Chief Simmons.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.786
Simmons? There's no Simmons here.
I'm Chief McClarty.

12:26.038 --> 12:28.624
Has there ever been a Chief Simmons?

12:28.707 --> 12:30.751
Not since I've been here.
And I've been here a long time.

12:30.834 --> 12:32.169
Right. Okay.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.297
Is there anything
that I can help you with?

12:35.380 --> 12:36.882
No, I think we're all good.

12:36.965 --> 12:39.176
Thank you so much,
and sorry to bother you.

12:40.511 --> 12:41.970
Elijah, let's go.

12:43.722 --> 12:45.432
Mary Ann, wait.

12:46.183 --> 12:47.768
Elijah, we're done here.

12:54.816 --> 12:56.276
Hey. Hey, kid, careful.

12:56.360 --> 12:58.570
That is a signed
Johnny Bench baseball right there.

13:00.239 --> 13:01.406
-Son of a...
-Elijah.

13:01.490 --> 13:02.491
What the hell?

13:03.659 --> 13:07.496
I'm sorry. He's having a rough day.

13:07.579 --> 13:09.957
-Get over here, Elijah. Let's go.
-Yeah? Well, join the club.

13:13.043 --> 13:14.586
What did you think
you were doing in there?

13:15.712 --> 13:16.713
Look.

13:17.172 --> 13:19.341
-You stole a picture?
-Look.

13:19.424 --> 13:20.634
From a police station?

13:20.717 --> 13:21.844
It's him.

13:22.761 --> 13:24.972
-See?
-No, it's not him.

13:25.055 --> 13:27.808
Look, Elijah, "1938." This is not him.

13:27.891 --> 13:29.601
It's not possible.

14:06.263 --> 14:08.557
Mr. Woodrow, you ready for another...

14:11.894 --> 14:12.978
Nothing personal.

14:15.063 --> 14:17.149
Hey, there's no need for all the muscle.

14:17.232 --> 14:18.901
My boys have the situation in hand.

14:18.984 --> 14:22.446
All due respect to your boys, but you
can go home now. We've got it from here.

14:28.118 --> 14:30.787
If you really respected authority,
you would let me do my job.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.789
This is no longer your job.

14:32.873 --> 14:35.083
How about you put me in touch
with the guy in charge of your unit,

14:35.167 --> 14:37.169
-and we can clear all this up.
-The guy in charge isn't a guy

14:37.252 --> 14:39.421
and is starting to lose her patience.

14:51.892 --> 14:52.893
Wait.

15:11.495 --> 15:13.288
I really don't know how she fell.

15:13.372 --> 15:16.792
But, I mean, it was really weird,
'cause she called me and she was, like,

15:16.875 --> 15:21.755
"Hey, I'm in the bathtub and I'm wrapped
in the curtain, so call 911."

15:21.839 --> 15:23.465
So I was like, "Okay."

15:34.226 --> 15:35.227
Parking lot.

15:47.948 --> 15:49.950
Hey! That's my bike, man!

16:04.381 --> 16:06.133
Scan all the way down.

16:07.801 --> 16:09.511
Not in the sample area.

16:14.266 --> 16:16.435
Sir, we got an anomaly.

16:16.518 --> 16:20.063
Of course we've got an anomaly.
This whole thing is an anomaly.

16:20.147 --> 16:21.273
Oh, right.

16:21.356 --> 16:23.275
Hey, sir.

16:23.358 --> 16:27.571
I know it's a doorway and all,
and we gotta send everything back through.

16:27.654 --> 16:30.866
But in the training, they did not really
tell us what happens if we don't.

16:30.949 --> 16:33.410
It was all "top secret" this
and "classified" that, and...

16:33.493 --> 16:34.828
But I'm thinking,
now that we're in the field,

16:34.912 --> 16:37.039
and it's just
one civil servant to another,

16:37.789 --> 16:42.002
what are the consequences
if we don't put back everything that came?

16:42.961 --> 16:44.421
Just fix the plane.

16:45.172 --> 16:48.091
That can't be him.
It's probably his grandfather--

16:48.175 --> 16:49.760
No, it's him.

16:49.843 --> 16:53.722
That's the thing with time travel.
It pulls you to where you belong.

16:53.805 --> 16:54.973
It's like destiny.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.060
Wait in the car, please.

17:25.546 --> 17:28.048
My new school is Jefferson Elementary?

17:28.131 --> 17:29.216
In Burlington?

17:30.217 --> 17:32.094
That's where Aunt Julie lives.

17:36.056 --> 17:38.058
I thought we were moving to California.

17:38.141 --> 17:39.142
Yeah.

17:43.438 --> 17:45.315
You're moving to California.

17:47.359 --> 17:48.652
You're abandoning me?

17:48.735 --> 17:51.780
No, I'm not, I'm not abandoning you. I'm--

17:53.740 --> 17:58.120
Look, your Aunt Julie said
that Jefferson is a really good school.

17:58.704 --> 18:01.206
There are great schools
in California, too.

18:02.541 --> 18:04.209
Why can't I just be with you?

18:05.669 --> 18:07.754
You were always the most
important thing to your dad,

18:07.838 --> 18:12.426
and I promised him-- I promised him that
I would always do what's best for you.

18:12.509 --> 18:14.261
How is this best for me?

18:15.554 --> 18:16.972
We've been okay...

18:17.764 --> 18:18.765
since...

18:22.394 --> 18:23.937
Have I been too much trouble?

18:25.522 --> 18:26.523
No.

18:26.899 --> 18:29.443
No. No. You haven't been trouble.

18:30.444 --> 18:31.570
Okay? Look...

18:34.031 --> 18:35.240
This isn't about you.

18:36.867 --> 18:39.786
Look, I have to give you
the best chance you have, okay?

18:39.870 --> 18:41.663
And it's just not with me.

18:41.747 --> 18:44.208
Please don't fight me on this.
Please, Elijah.

18:50.464 --> 18:51.465
Okay.

19:01.934 --> 19:05.103
Elijah, everything is gonna be okay.

19:05.187 --> 19:08.815
Your aunt is gonna take really good care
of you, and that's what matters.

19:10.692 --> 19:12.694
But who's gonna take care of you?

19:12.778 --> 19:15.656
I know you don't sleep. I hear you crying.

19:15.739 --> 19:17.991
Hey, it's not your job
to take care of me, okay?

19:18.075 --> 19:19.076
Mary Ann!

19:20.577 --> 19:23.080
Oh, my God! Are you okay?

19:25.165 --> 19:26.166
You again.

19:27.626 --> 19:28.919
-You all right?
-I told you.

19:29.002 --> 19:30.295
This has to be a sign.

19:30.671 --> 19:32.506
He crashed into us, twice!

19:32.589 --> 19:33.757
Okay.

19:33.841 --> 19:35.217
-Shoot.
-We found a picture.

19:35.676 --> 19:36.718
-Is that you?
-Elijah, come on.

19:36.802 --> 19:39.763
Where did you get this? Yeah, that's me.
This is Simmons, right here.

19:40.180 --> 19:42.224
Weber, he enlisted
right after Pearl Harbor.

19:42.307 --> 19:43.851
O'Hora, Bragdon, Kelly--

19:44.184 --> 19:45.727
-Elijah. No.
-See? He's a soldier, Mary Ann.

19:45.811 --> 19:46.812
Where did you get this?

19:46.895 --> 19:49.189
-Elijah! We gotta go.
-A real one. He needs our help!

19:51.859 --> 19:53.861
All right. Where were you going?

19:54.611 --> 19:56.780
Well, I gotta go home.
I gotta get to my wife.

19:56.864 --> 19:59.658
She doesn't know what happened to me.
I have to go see her. I have to tell her.

20:00.450 --> 20:01.827
Come on, please.

20:02.953 --> 20:04.955
-Get in.
-Come on, get in the car. Get in!

20:05.038 --> 20:06.123
Come on, let's go!

20:07.875 --> 20:09.126
It's on this street.

20:09.209 --> 20:11.336
Just about a mile up the road after the...

20:14.631 --> 20:15.716
Everything's changed.

20:23.056 --> 20:24.558
There. There.

20:24.641 --> 20:26.268
-Right there. That's my house.
-Okay.

20:26.351 --> 20:28.312
Stop, stop. Right here.

20:38.322 --> 20:39.323
Pauline?

20:40.616 --> 20:41.742
Pauline? Hello?

20:43.410 --> 20:45.120
Hello? Is there anybody here?

20:45.204 --> 20:46.788
Pauline? Anybody home?

20:50.584 --> 20:51.919
Excuse me, can I help you?

20:53.921 --> 20:55.130
I'm looking for Pauline.

20:55.506 --> 20:56.548
I'm her husband.

20:56.632 --> 20:59.593
Her husband? Aren't you a little young
to be her husband?

21:02.387 --> 21:03.722
I'm sorry. What is this about?

21:04.556 --> 21:08.101
My friend, he was in an accident,
and he's...

21:08.977 --> 21:10.521
He's an old friend of Pauline's.

21:10.604 --> 21:12.898
Oh, really? That's nice.

21:13.357 --> 21:15.817
Ever since the kids moved away,
she gets so few visitors.

21:15.901 --> 21:17.528
Would you like to say hello?

21:22.824 --> 21:23.909
She's alive?

21:23.992 --> 21:25.118
Yes, of course.

21:25.494 --> 21:26.495
I'm her nurse.

21:27.120 --> 21:30.249
Pauline's at her pottery class,
but she should be back any minute now.

21:31.124 --> 21:32.793
You're more than welcome to stay.

21:32.876 --> 21:34.586
-I'll go make us some tea.
-Thank you.

21:34.962 --> 21:35.963
Of course.

21:58.235 --> 21:59.570
I think I'll wait outside.

22:22.426 --> 22:23.427
What is it?

22:26.221 --> 22:28.056
It's his obituary.

22:29.099 --> 22:34.521
He crashed in Burma, and he was shot
and killed while trying to evade capture.

22:35.814 --> 22:39.276
<i>The crash has caused delays
in all directions to and from Dayton,</i>

22:39.359 --> 22:41.528
<i>as authorities begin their manhunt.</i>

22:41.612 --> 22:43.530
<i>-The pilot, a World War II...</i>
-We're on TV.

22:43.614 --> 22:45.490
<i>...reenactor named Clarence Woodrow...</i>

22:45.574 --> 22:47.492
What is this about?
I'm calling the police.

22:47.576 --> 22:48.660
No.

22:49.369 --> 22:51.121
-Someone's coming.
-They're here for you. Go!

22:51.205 --> 22:52.789
-Maybe we should talk to them!
-Go, Lieutenant!

22:56.001 --> 22:57.169
Back, back.

22:57.252 --> 22:59.421
<i>Lieutenant Cole, please exit the house.</i>

22:59.505 --> 23:02.257
<i>Lieutenant Cole, please come out now.</i>

23:02.883 --> 23:04.635
Go ahead. Pull it up. Pull it up.

23:05.052 --> 23:06.053
Inside.

23:07.429 --> 23:09.139
Lieutenant Cole. Lieutenant Cole.

23:10.766 --> 23:13.477
I need you to just stay calm
and listen to me.

23:13.894 --> 23:17.981
We're just here to fix all this and make
sure we get you back to where you belong.

23:21.068 --> 23:25.197
That was a seismic tremor caused by
you being here, by what happened to you.

23:25.280 --> 23:27.574
You came here
through something called a Rift.

23:27.658 --> 23:28.659
A what?

23:28.742 --> 23:31.453
Basically, Lieutenant,
you have traveled into the future.

23:31.537 --> 23:34.790
Now, do you want to go back to see
your wife, back to the way things were?

23:34.873 --> 23:36.583
You can, but we need to hurry.

23:36.667 --> 23:37.709
What are you talking about?

23:37.793 --> 23:39.711
The Rift you came through is still open.

23:39.795 --> 23:41.797
-We can send you back to Pauline.
-No!

23:41.880 --> 23:43.799
-It'll be as if you didn't miss a thing.
-Elijah, stop!

23:43.882 --> 23:47.845
No! You died in Burma.
We saw your obituary. Come on, go!

23:47.928 --> 23:49.388
-Lieutenant!
-Come on, get in.

23:49.471 --> 23:50.764
-Stand down!
-Elijah, don't!

23:50.848 --> 23:52.057
You need to trust us!

23:52.140 --> 23:53.141
Get in!

23:53.225 --> 23:55.143
-Get in. Come on. Get in.
-Elijah, get back here.

23:55.227 --> 23:56.395
-Come on!
-Elijah.

23:56.478 --> 23:59.439
We're just here to make things right.
Lieutenant, open the door!

23:59.523 --> 24:02.234
Wait, you can't shoot him!
Elijah, get out.

24:02.317 --> 24:05.237
-Why is there only two pedals?
-'Cause they're different now! Come on!

24:05.320 --> 24:07.364
-I don't know what to do!
-Step on it!

24:07.447 --> 24:08.699
Elijah, get out of the...

24:09.199 --> 24:10.200
Go! Go!

24:10.576 --> 24:11.577
Don't shoot!

24:17.833 --> 24:20.377
Get somebody in the air! Now!

24:23.130 --> 24:24.923
They're gaining on you! Go, go!

24:26.592 --> 24:28.260
-Go!
-Got it.

24:31.054 --> 24:32.055
Hang on.

24:35.309 --> 24:36.310
Cole!

24:36.894 --> 24:37.895
Look out!

24:39.771 --> 24:41.106
-Cole!
-Just trust me.

24:43.483 --> 24:44.610
Where are you going?

24:44.693 --> 24:47.529
There's an old moonshine road up here
that leads to Miller's River.

24:47.613 --> 24:49.031
I don't see a road!

24:49.281 --> 24:50.866
Like I said, just trust me.

24:52.451 --> 24:53.452
Now, hang on.

25:01.960 --> 25:03.587
We did it! Yeah!

25:06.340 --> 25:08.383
-No! No!
-Come on. No, no!

25:17.809 --> 25:18.810
You okay, kid?

25:19.478 --> 25:21.188
That was epic!

25:21.647 --> 25:25.442
It was, like, a million to one,
and we still got away.

25:26.527 --> 25:28.362
Well, I had a hell of a copilot.

25:32.282 --> 25:33.742
-Is something wrong?
-No.

25:34.368 --> 25:36.703
Just across the river.
I think it's still there.

25:38.205 --> 25:39.206
Come on!

25:54.680 --> 25:55.681
What is that?

25:56.223 --> 25:59.226
The place my wife and I last danced
before I shipped out.

26:00.519 --> 26:02.020
Artie Shaw played right there.

26:02.563 --> 26:04.439
But it doesn't matter.

26:05.983 --> 26:07.192
It's all wrecked anyway.

26:08.694 --> 26:09.903
Never even said goodbye.

26:11.154 --> 26:12.155
What?

26:12.239 --> 26:13.699
It's a dumb superstition.

26:14.867 --> 26:18.829
I thought that by never saying goodbye,
it meant that I was never really gone.

26:19.538 --> 26:20.873
So I could never get hurt.

26:22.249 --> 26:24.793
It always worked... till it didn't.

26:27.462 --> 26:30.174
Hey, what did that say, anyhow? My obit.

26:31.425 --> 26:32.426
What happened to me?

26:33.427 --> 26:38.557
You crashed and you were shot
and killed trying not to be captured.

26:41.393 --> 26:42.811
And they wanna send me back?

26:44.646 --> 26:45.814
Maybe I should let 'em.

26:47.482 --> 26:48.734
I don't belong here, kid.

26:49.693 --> 26:51.403
And you, you belong with your mom.

26:51.945 --> 26:55.949
Stepmom. And she doesn't want me anyway.

26:56.783 --> 26:58.911
She just wants
to dump me off with my aunt.

27:00.662 --> 27:02.122
We've both got nowhere to go.

27:05.709 --> 27:06.710
Come on.

27:07.211 --> 27:09.129
Let's keep moving before they find us.

27:09.963 --> 27:12.382
What's the point anyway? Me staying here.

27:13.425 --> 27:14.593
Pauline moved on.

27:14.676 --> 27:17.679
She lived a whole life,
a happy life, with somebody else.

27:18.472 --> 27:20.140
But you can't die.

27:20.390 --> 27:21.391
Maybe I have to.

27:21.767 --> 27:22.935
No. You can't!

27:23.018 --> 27:26.396
And why is it so important to you, kid?
Why can't you just let this go?

27:35.364 --> 27:36.698
My dad.

27:38.283 --> 27:40.327
He died in a war, too.

27:40.410 --> 27:42.287
In Afghanistan, last April.

27:46.959 --> 27:47.960
I'm sorry, kid.

27:49.962 --> 27:51.338
Really, I am.

27:51.421 --> 27:53.131
But this world has nothing for me.

28:05.227 --> 28:06.228
What...

28:06.687 --> 28:09.940
What if there is a way for you
to get your life back with Pauline?

28:11.733 --> 28:13.652
The life that the other guy took from you?

28:13.735 --> 28:14.736
Knock it off, kid.

28:16.029 --> 28:17.030
No.

28:18.198 --> 28:22.077
What if you did go back in that Rift,
but you don't get killed?

28:23.412 --> 28:25.080
What if we changed things?

28:25.706 --> 28:29.960
What if this time when you crashed,
the bad guys can't hurt you?

28:30.544 --> 28:33.797
Like, if you had a better gun.
Or some Kevlar.

28:33.881 --> 28:34.882
Kev-what?

28:34.965 --> 28:36.258
It's like a bulletproof vest.

28:36.341 --> 28:38.343
My dad told me all about this stuff.

28:38.844 --> 28:40.179
We can get you some of it.

28:42.973 --> 28:43.974
This is it.

28:45.184 --> 28:47.477
This has to be
why the Rift brought you here,

28:47.936 --> 28:50.022
to give you a second chance.

29:05.370 --> 29:06.538
What are we doing here?

29:07.164 --> 29:10.667
Shouldn't we be out looking for Elijah?
Shouldn't we be scouring the town?

29:10.751 --> 29:14.087
We are, but there is a far quicker way
to find him, and that's you.

29:14.963 --> 29:19.885
This soldier is a man out of time,
and your son is his best shot at escape.

29:20.636 --> 29:22.346
And you're the only one
who knows that kid.

29:22.429 --> 29:25.307
So if anyone's gonna
be able to find him, it is you.

29:26.225 --> 29:28.727
No, I'm not helping you. You're liars.

29:29.228 --> 29:31.271
You're gonna send
that soldier back to die.

29:31.355 --> 29:32.773
While I sympathize,

29:32.856 --> 29:36.568
you have to start trusting me
more than the lieutenant right now,

29:36.652 --> 29:38.570
because there is far more
at stake than you realize.

29:38.654 --> 29:41.573
Yeah, well, I've spent some time
with Cole. He's a good man.

29:42.324 --> 29:44.493
I wish I could say
the same thing about you.

29:46.870 --> 29:49.373
Well, then I guess it's time
you got to know me better.

29:49.873 --> 29:54.294
We might have time, if you want...
to try and see your wife...

29:55.879 --> 29:56.880
in case...

29:56.964 --> 29:58.465
You're wrong about this plan?

29:58.549 --> 30:02.803
It'll work, but, you know, in case...

30:04.012 --> 30:05.013
No. Thanks, kid.

30:06.139 --> 30:07.599
I don't wanna see her now.

30:07.683 --> 30:10.394
Because of the risk 'cause
they might be waiting for you?

30:10.477 --> 30:12.312
Because she moved on.

30:12.396 --> 30:14.731
You got all that from a few pictures?

30:16.024 --> 30:18.277
How can you be sure that she moved on?

30:20.696 --> 30:23.073
On our first date,
I took Pauline to the movies.

30:24.324 --> 30:25.576
<i>Bringing Up Baby.</i>

30:26.952 --> 30:28.537
I bought her a box of Cracker Jacks.

30:28.620 --> 30:34.209
And the prize inside, it was
this little green four-leaf clover pin.

30:34.877 --> 30:36.670
You know what that symbolizes?

30:36.753 --> 30:37.754
Good luck?

30:38.088 --> 30:39.089
Right.

30:39.381 --> 30:43.093
She said it was a sign
that we would always have good luck,

30:44.469 --> 30:46.305
and that we would always be together.

30:46.388 --> 30:48.557
So when we got married
and we got that house,

30:48.640 --> 30:52.394
the first thing that she did was walk in
the door and nail that pin to the mantel.

30:54.521 --> 30:56.356
When I was there earlier, I checked.

30:59.193 --> 31:00.194
It was gone.

31:03.405 --> 31:05.365
She probably pulled it out decades ago.

31:07.951 --> 31:09.578
She doesn't want to remember me.

31:12.497 --> 31:13.707
What are they doing?

31:13.790 --> 31:17.002
Restoring the plane to exactly
what it was so it can fly again,

31:17.711 --> 31:20.088
and we can send the pilot back
just as he came.

31:20.172 --> 31:21.965
Why? The past is fine.

31:22.049 --> 31:23.383
History hasn't changed.

31:23.467 --> 31:26.345
Mary Ann, this is not
about changing history.

31:27.679 --> 31:28.680
Take a look at this.

31:29.223 --> 31:30.682
1971.

31:30.766 --> 31:32.017
Sylmar, California.

31:32.100 --> 31:35.312
A devastating earthquake
of 6.5 on the Richter scale

31:35.771 --> 31:39.274
kills 65 people,
causes a half a billion in damage.

31:39.358 --> 31:40.359
A Rift.

31:41.527 --> 31:45.280
2009, the Cataño oil refinery disaster.

31:45.364 --> 31:48.617
A 50-mile-radius explosion,
destroyed a city.

31:49.826 --> 31:51.495
Also a Rift.

31:51.578 --> 31:53.372
Global catastrophes throughout history

31:53.455 --> 31:56.041
that you thought
were accidents or natural disasters

31:56.124 --> 31:58.669
were caused by the same type
of event that brought the pilot here.

31:58.752 --> 32:01.797
If we can get whatever came through
back in time just right,

32:01.880 --> 32:04.049
the Rift closes and no one gets hurt.

32:05.300 --> 32:06.552
Now, what about your boy?

32:11.348 --> 32:12.891
He's got my phone.

32:13.767 --> 32:15.352
Kid, slow down. What is this place?

32:15.435 --> 32:17.229
It's called an Army Surplus store.

32:17.312 --> 32:19.940
I saw it when we drove through.
They should have everything you'll need.

32:20.023 --> 32:21.608
Kevlar, night vision...

32:21.692 --> 32:22.693
Night vision?

32:23.193 --> 32:25.612
So you can, you know, see at night.

32:25.696 --> 32:28.448
Yeah, the name kind of says it all.
You have all that stuff now?

32:28.532 --> 32:29.825
You have no idea.

32:30.200 --> 32:31.660
You can pick the lock, right?

32:32.160 --> 32:33.704
What do I look like, a cat burglar?

32:34.329 --> 32:36.498
I mean, maybe I can try
and jimmy this open.

32:37.875 --> 32:39.042
This is all steel, kid.

32:42.629 --> 32:45.799
So, just how many
of these things have you dealt with?

32:45.883 --> 32:48.177
More than most people
feel comfortable knowing about.

32:49.428 --> 32:52.222
And how many times have you failed?

32:52.723 --> 32:55.142
More times than most people
would feel comfortable knowing about.

32:55.225 --> 32:57.019
Bill thinks it's because
we missed something,

32:57.102 --> 32:59.605
like a button on a shirt
or a cuff link, something tiny.

33:00.022 --> 33:03.400
Wait. So if you don't think it's about
sending them back the way they came--

33:03.483 --> 33:04.943
It doesn't always work when we do that.

33:05.027 --> 33:06.403
Well, what do you think?

33:06.486 --> 33:07.905
I think the Rift has a will.

33:08.739 --> 33:10.866
I think what it does,
it does for a reason.

33:13.410 --> 33:16.079
Every time someone comes through,
takes us a while to track them down.

33:16.163 --> 33:18.248
Three hours, five hours, seven hours.

33:18.999 --> 33:22.169
But the Rift always stays open
for exactly 11.

33:23.670 --> 33:26.590
So you think something
is supposed to happen in that time?

33:26.673 --> 33:28.467
I think something needs to happen.

33:28.550 --> 33:31.094
What? What does Cole need to do?

33:33.555 --> 33:34.640
I have no idea.

33:40.604 --> 33:41.897
Come on! Hurry! Hurry!

33:41.980 --> 33:43.482
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

33:44.483 --> 33:45.484
Come on!

33:48.153 --> 33:49.154
Be careful.

33:49.655 --> 33:51.281
Who are these guys?

33:51.365 --> 33:53.033
<i>Eyes on target. Set her down.</i>

34:03.502 --> 34:04.586
Go, go, go!

34:16.223 --> 34:17.808
-There they are.
-Wait, wait.

34:17.891 --> 34:21.311
Let me talk to him.
He's scared, and he's got my kid.

34:21.812 --> 34:22.813
Go.

34:26.315 --> 34:29.444
No, Mary Ann, no!
You don't understand what we're doing!

34:29.902 --> 34:33.699
No, sweetheart, no, you don't understand.
Look, neither of you do.

34:33.782 --> 34:37.244
I get it, miss. They want me to go back,
and I'm more than willing to do so.

34:37.327 --> 34:38.661
But I got some conditions.

34:38.996 --> 34:41.706
I need a weapon,
and I need some protection. Some...

34:41.790 --> 34:43.625
-Kevlar!
-"Kevlar," that's right.

34:44.001 --> 34:45.585
I'm a fighter, all right, Mary Ann?

34:45.668 --> 34:48.172
-I'm gonna beat this thing.
-No, Cole, you can't.

34:48.255 --> 34:50.257
You can't fight. You can't do any of that.

34:51.507 --> 34:54.052
That thing up there.
Look, it's happened before.

34:55.053 --> 34:58.265
And they say if you don't go back
just exactly the way you came through...

34:58.348 --> 35:01.810
that... everything
within ten miles of here dies.

35:03.103 --> 35:05.898
So that means
you can't bring anything back.

35:05.981 --> 35:08.025
You can't change anything.

35:08.901 --> 35:10.194
No.

35:10.277 --> 35:11.278
No.

35:11.862 --> 35:12.905
No.

35:12.988 --> 35:14.781
No, they're lying to you!

35:14.865 --> 35:16.116
-Hey.
-They have to be!

35:16.200 --> 35:18.702
I know you wanted to save him, okay?

35:18.785 --> 35:19.995
So did I.

35:20.913 --> 35:22.623
But this is the way it has to be.

35:25.125 --> 35:27.377
You have to go through. I'm sorry.

35:28.545 --> 35:29.880
I'm so sorry.

35:33.258 --> 35:35.260
Destiny's a son of a bitch, ain't it?

35:38.889 --> 35:40.516
Wait a second. Wait. Wait.

35:41.391 --> 35:43.143
-There might be more.
-I'm sorry?

35:43.227 --> 35:46.855
This thing, it brought you back
not just here to this time,

35:46.939 --> 35:49.191
but it brought you back
to this place, to your home.

35:49.900 --> 35:54.196
What if this Rift
or whoever made it or whatever it is,

35:54.279 --> 35:57.115
what if it does these things for a reason?

35:58.700 --> 36:00.744
What reason could that possibly be?

36:07.668 --> 36:08.836
I think I know.

36:33.777 --> 36:34.778
Five minutes.

37:06.226 --> 37:07.227
Hi, Pauline.

37:14.568 --> 37:15.652
It's me, Pauline.

37:16.236 --> 37:17.237
Teddy?

37:17.779 --> 37:19.072
Yeah.

37:20.115 --> 37:21.116
What...

37:21.450 --> 37:22.451
I'm sorry.

37:24.077 --> 37:27.331
I'm sorry that I let a stupid superstition
get the better of me.

37:27.414 --> 37:29.333
I'm sorry that I never said goodbye.

37:30.375 --> 37:33.337
I know you moved on.
I know you forgot about me.

37:33.921 --> 37:35.923
But I needed you to know...

37:38.050 --> 37:39.051
that I love you.

37:39.927 --> 37:41.970
I always have and I always will.

37:42.596 --> 37:43.889
Oh, Teddy.

37:45.224 --> 37:47.351
I'm sorry.
I don't have very much time.

37:50.812 --> 37:51.813
I gotta go now.

37:59.780 --> 38:00.781
Teddy.

38:19.633 --> 38:20.634
Pauline.

38:22.427 --> 38:24.304
Let's cut a rug one more time.

38:25.180 --> 38:26.181
What do you say?

38:26.640 --> 38:31.019
-Oh, Teddy, I can't dance anymore.
-It's okay. I've got you.

38:35.274 --> 38:36.275
I got you.

39:09.683 --> 39:10.893
Goodbye, Pauline.

39:31.663 --> 39:32.664
Cole.

39:39.463 --> 39:40.464
Hey, kid.

39:55.103 --> 39:57.940
You got a good head on your shoulders,
kid. You're gonna be fine.

39:58.023 --> 39:59.024
All right?

40:00.651 --> 40:01.902
Thank you for everything.

40:05.447 --> 40:07.449
I gotta have a moment with your stepmom.

40:12.663 --> 40:14.623
California? It's a nice place.

40:15.123 --> 40:17.793
-Yeah.
-I trained out in Riverside back in '39.

40:19.378 --> 40:20.754
It's a big state, you know.

40:23.715 --> 40:24.716
Gets lonely.

40:28.262 --> 40:29.263
So he told you.

40:29.763 --> 40:34.852
Yeah. He told me...
about you dropping him off in Indiana.

40:39.773 --> 40:40.774
I can't.

40:43.151 --> 40:44.611
After I lost Steve...

40:45.237 --> 40:46.822
I can't take care of myself.

40:46.905 --> 40:48.073
How am I supposed to...

40:50.993 --> 40:53.829
Every time I look at Elijah,
all I see is him.

40:55.581 --> 41:00.419
You know, the whole thing about how
this is all supposed to be for a reason?

41:00.502 --> 41:01.628
Yeah.

41:01.712 --> 41:05.465
I think you're half right that I came back
to this spot because Pauline is here,

41:05.549 --> 41:08.468
but I also came back
to this time because you are.

41:08.969 --> 41:10.345
What are you talking about?

41:11.054 --> 41:12.514
Look, think about it.

41:12.598 --> 41:17.436
A pilot killed in combat meets a woman
who lost a pilot of her own.

41:18.270 --> 41:20.939
That's not a coincidence, Mary Ann.

41:21.023 --> 41:23.025
That's a message,
a message from your husband.

41:25.903 --> 41:29.281
Saying goodbye to Pauline
was what I was supposed to do.

41:29.364 --> 41:32.117
-Well, what am I supposed to do?
-I can't tell you that.

41:32.743 --> 41:35.454
But I'm pretty sure you'd know
what your husband's telling you.

41:41.752 --> 41:42.753
Ready, Lieutenant?

41:43.253 --> 41:44.254
Yes, sir.

41:51.428 --> 41:52.429
This should do it.

41:53.013 --> 41:54.973
That covers everything
that came through with you.

41:57.518 --> 41:58.519
Good luck.

42:04.316 --> 42:06.276
Oh, jeez. Wait.

42:06.818 --> 42:07.861
Hey, kid.

42:08.737 --> 42:11.114
I hate to do this,
but I'm gonna need that Whiz bar back.

42:11.198 --> 42:12.199
Are you kidding me?

42:12.282 --> 42:14.034
-You gave him something?
-It's just candy.

42:14.117 --> 42:15.118
Come on, kid.

42:15.202 --> 42:18.497
-It's okay. Go ahead. Give it to him.
-Come on. We don't have much time.

42:18.580 --> 42:21.792
On the way back... I got hungry.

42:26.797 --> 42:29.049
We need everything?

42:30.425 --> 42:34.513
Okay, so we pack up, and we evacuate or...

42:34.596 --> 42:35.639
No, it's too late.

42:35.722 --> 42:38.058
We'll never make it back
to the minimum safe distance.

42:49.695 --> 42:50.821
It's okay.

42:51.738 --> 42:52.948
It's okay.

42:53.031 --> 42:55.158
I'm still going up. This is gonna work.

42:55.951 --> 43:00.122
The Rift, it's not about putting back
some Whiz bar.

43:00.205 --> 43:03.041
I did what it wanted me to do...
and so will you.

43:05.752 --> 43:08.297
Don't worry. We got this.

43:08.839 --> 43:10.174
<i>Five minutes to closure.</i>

43:16.722 --> 43:18.140
Clear it out. Let's go.

43:35.157 --> 43:36.658
Thank you again.

43:39.786 --> 43:40.787
No.

44:29.419 --> 44:30.420
Two minutes.

44:50.732 --> 44:52.317
Ninety seconds to Rift closure.

45:07.916 --> 45:08.917
One minute.

45:23.140 --> 45:24.224
It's gonna be okay.

45:24.308 --> 45:25.893
-I love you.
-I love you.

45:27.394 --> 45:28.687
We're gonna be okay.

46:09.895 --> 46:12.231
Are you okay? He did it.
