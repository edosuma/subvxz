- Go home, Luke.

Well, actually, I was thinking
I was gonna watch a little bit more tape.

01:57.617 --> 02:02.145

a great assistant coach this year,

take over the team.

before you get us both fired.

16:11.470 --> 16:15.429
All right. Well, look, I've got dinner
reservations for us at 8:00.

16:15.507 --> 16:17.031
- Is that too late?
- No, it's actually...

16:17.109 --> 16:19.509
It's kind of early.
We usually go till at least 9:00.

16:19.578 --> 16:22.012
- All right, then it's 9:30.
- Perfect.

16:22.081 --> 16:24.413
I'll meet you at the restaurant.
Just text me the address, okay?

16:24.483 --> 16:25.814
All right.

16:27.119 --> 16:31.317
God, Luke, it is so good to see you. Bye.

16:39.565 --> 16:45.060
Hi. I'm so sorry I'm so late.
I got stuck going over the canyon.

16:45.137 --> 16:46.764
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm just glad you're here.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.864
- God, look at you.
- What?

16:49.341 --> 16:51.866
No, I just... I haven't seen a suit
on anybody in so long.

16:51.944 --> 16:56.506
Unless they're an agent or a lawyer
or a successful novelist.

16:56.682 --> 17:00.311
Oh, I don't know about that.
I get a new rejection letter every day.

17:00.386 --> 17:04.378
Luke, your book is good.
It's gonna happen, I know it.

17:10.729 --> 17:14.665
So when the executives blow off
the shows, we get the tickets.

17:14.733 --> 17:18.328
Like, Monday, I went and saw Ryan Adams
at the Viper Room,

17:18.404 --> 17:22.238
and then Wednesday
was Tegan and Sara at the Roxy, and...

17:22.307 --> 17:24.707
I don't know. It just...
It blows my mind, you know?

17:24.777 --> 17:27.644
These are bands we grew up listening to
and now I've got a front row seat.

17:27.713 --> 17:28.805
That's great.

17:28.881 --> 17:33.181
You know, we've had our fair share of
bands, too, in Tree Hill thanks to you.

17:33.252 --> 17:37.120
God. Anyway, enough about me.
You won a fricking championship.

17:37.189 --> 17:39.157
I wanna hear everything.

17:39.391 --> 17:42.326
Well, Whitey's gonna step down
as head coach.

17:42.661 --> 17:44.322
And he wants me to take over the team.

17:44.396 --> 17:48.526
I mean, he thinks it'll be good for Nathan
and he thinks I'm ready.

17:48.734 --> 17:51.601
- Luke, that's incredible.
- I know. I get salary, benefits,

17:51.670 --> 17:56.198
- and a big office.
- Wow, that sounds very adult.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.302
I got that song you sent.

18:00.379 --> 18:02.973
Oh, you know what?
I have something else for you, too.

18:03.048 --> 18:07.144
I made you a mix of a bunch of stuff
that doesn't street for a couple months.

18:08.587 --> 18:09.918
Thank you.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.789
I got you something, too. Um...

18:13.859 --> 18:16.623
(PHONE BEEPING)
Oh, crap. I'm sorry.

18:18.997 --> 18:20.658
- It's work.
- Don't... Don't answer.

18:20.732 --> 18:22.563
They're just gonna keep calling back.

18:22.634 --> 18:25.034
Hello? Well, yeah...

18:26.305 --> 18:27.897
Right now?

18:29.174 --> 18:32.371
Yeah, yeah, of course I like my job.

18:33.145 --> 18:35.113
Okay. Right away, sir.

18:36.482 --> 18:37.813
I'm sorry.

18:38.584 --> 18:40.916
Well, can't you at least stay for dessert?

18:40.986 --> 18:44.615
Tell you what. How about we have dessert
back at my place?

18:44.790 --> 18:48.851
Or how about at our room
at the Beverly Hilton?

18:48.927 --> 18:52.658
- Luke, you did not have to do that.
- I wanted to.

18:53.799 --> 18:58.293
All right, this is gonna be quick.
I'll be there by 11:00, I promise.

18:58.370 --> 19:00.668
- All right.
- Bye.

19:55.494 --> 19:56.483
(GROANS)

19:56.895 --> 19:58.988
Hey, when did you get here?

19:59.331 --> 20:02.630
- I don't know, like an hour ago.
- You know, you could've...

20:02.701 --> 20:05.101
- You could have woke me up.
- Luke.

20:08.473 --> 20:13.410
What is this? I couldn't bring myself
to open it, but I...

20:13.612 --> 20:17.912
I've just been sitting here,
thinking about how much I love you.

20:20.652 --> 20:24.986
Well, I wanted it to be a surprise, but...

20:38.770 --> 20:43.230
Peyton, I love you.
And I want us to be together forever.

20:43.308 --> 20:48.211
- Luke, wait, okay?
- I know it's a bit sudden, okay?

20:48.280 --> 20:52.011
But, I mean, yesterday was a great day,

20:52.884 --> 20:54.977
and I'm sitting on the bus,

20:55.654 --> 20:59.886
and I realize that none of my great days
in my life

21:01.293 --> 21:03.022
matter without you.

21:04.129 --> 21:06.962
You're the one I want next to me
when my dreams come true,

21:07.032 --> 21:10.297
and you're the one I want next to me
if they don't.

21:11.270 --> 21:15.468
As long as I have you,
nothing else matters.

21:16.475 --> 21:20.605
There's... It's just not as simple
as all of that, okay?

21:20.679 --> 21:23.375
I mean, there's a lot
we have to talk about.

21:23.448 --> 21:27.817
I know. But we'll figure out all the
details when we get back to Tree Hill.

21:27.886 --> 21:32.880
Okay, I know that's home for you,
and I miss it sometimes, I do. But for me,

21:32.958 --> 21:37.895
Tree Hill is two dead moms and a psycho
stalker and some really painful memories.

21:38.230 --> 21:41.825
You know, I actually had to move out to
Hollywood to get away from all the drama.

21:41.900 --> 21:45.267
So, right now, this is my home
and the only thing that's missing is you.

21:45.337 --> 21:49.137
- Then I'll move here.
- No. God. Luke, honey,

21:49.207 --> 21:52.074
Whitey believes in you
and Nathan needs you.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.736
And if I ask you to walk away
from your dream,

21:53.812 --> 21:56.076
you're gonna wake up one day
and you're gonna resent me for it,

21:56.148 --> 21:59.640
the same way I would feel
if you asked me to leave L.A.

22:01.153 --> 22:05.385
Peyton, you get people coffee
and deliver mail.

22:05.457 --> 22:07.721
You were doing more
than that in Tree Hill.

22:07.793 --> 22:12.628
Well, I love you for believing that,
but I have to prove that to myself.

22:13.098 --> 22:14.656
I mean, you see, that's the thing.

22:14.733 --> 22:18.169
We both have so much we wanna do
with our lives and we're only 19.

22:18.236 --> 22:20.500
And Nathan and Haley
were a lot younger than that.

22:20.572 --> 22:23.302
Okay, well, we see how easy that's been.

22:24.509 --> 22:27.535
Come on. In another year.

22:29.381 --> 22:33.715
Peyton, we've seen each other
three times in the last year.

22:35.320 --> 22:38.687
I mean, we go days without talking.
We trade few emails.

22:39.524 --> 22:41.651
We've already grown so far apart.

22:41.727 --> 22:44.525
And who knows where we'll be
a year from now.

22:44.596 --> 22:48.430
Luke, if you can't trust that our love
can make it one year,

22:48.734 --> 22:52.727
I don't understand how we can be
talking about forever right now.

22:53.939 --> 22:56.908
- You're saying no.
- No.

22:58.643 --> 23:03.410
I am not saying no. I'm saying not now.
I want to marry you someday.

23:03.949 --> 23:08.818
Hey, don't do that. Don't pull away
from me, okay? I want us to be together.

23:09.554 --> 23:13.149
- I love you so much.
- Just not enough.

23:16.294 --> 23:20.754
Oh, God. Can we take this back? Can we
just pretend like you never woke up?

23:20.832 --> 23:23.062
- Please.
- I don't think we can.

23:24.102 --> 23:27.128
I'm afraid that this conversation
is gonna end with...

23:27.205 --> 23:28.433
Goodbye.

23:32.511 --> 23:34.979
Oh, God, don't. Come here.

23:37.716 --> 23:40.344
Our dreams are gonna come true, Lucas.

23:40.886 --> 23:45.186
My music and your novel.
It's gonna happen, I know it.

24:11.783 --> 24:13.182
Bye, Peyton.

24:36.675 --> 24:37.767
Luke?

24:51.289 --> 24:53.621
Have a great flight to Hartford.

24:55.694 --> 24:57.184
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:57.729 --> 25:02.462
I'm sorry to bother you, but I have
to get back a little sooner than expected.

25:02.634 --> 25:04.898
- See what we can do.
- Thanks.

25:05.237 --> 25:06.704
(PHONE RINGING)

25:11.476 --> 25:14.707
Excuse me one second. Hello?

25:15.614 --> 25:18.515
- Hi, is this Lucas Scott?
- Yeah, who's this?

25:18.950 --> 25:23.080
My name's Lindsey Strauss.
I'm a junior editor at Putnam and Pratt.

25:23.154 --> 25:24.815
I read your novel.

25:25.090 --> 25:26.216
(LAUGHS)

25:26.291 --> 25:27.952
Oh, well, it's nice of you to call.

25:28.026 --> 25:30.324
Everyone else sends their rejection
letters first class.

25:30.395 --> 25:32.124
<i>Actually, I loved it.</i>

25:32.197 --> 25:35.758
And I passed it on to my boss
and he feels the same way.

25:36.868 --> 25:38.062
<i>Hello?</i>

25:38.570 --> 25:41.130
(STUTTERING) No, I'm still here.

25:41.206 --> 25:44.573
What I'm saying is,
we wanna publish your book, Lucas.

25:44.643 --> 25:46.975
How soon can you be in New York?

25:49.447 --> 25:50.709
(EX CLAIMS)

25:50.782 --> 25:54.309
I'll figure it out. Yeah, okay.

25:55.787 --> 25:59.086
I'm looking forward to seeing you, too.
Bye.

26:02.093 --> 26:06.291
I need to go to New York.
They're publishing my novel.

26:10.101 --> 26:13.161
Congratulations.
Must be a dream come true.

26:24.983 --> 26:26.507
You're all set.

26:32.958 --> 26:36.257
- Hey, I need you to go on a coffee run.
- Okay, in a minute.

26:36.328 --> 26:39.092
I don't have a minute. Hey.

26:39.464 --> 26:41.432
I said I need a minute!

26:49.708 --> 26:52.643
Don't get me wrong, the writing's good.
But I'm not gonna lie to you.

26:52.711 --> 26:54.906
When we found out your
father was a convicted murderer...

26:54.980 --> 26:58.279
I mean, that's exactly the kind of hook
we need in today's market.

26:58.350 --> 27:00.978
I think our newest literary talent
needs a drink.

27:01.052 --> 27:04.044
Well, when you're done,
let's talk about changing that title.

27:04.122 --> 27:06.556
- What's wrong with the title?
- They say that about every book.

27:06.625 --> 27:09.856
I love the title.
<i>Murder of Crows, Parliament of Owls.</i>

27:09.928 --> 27:11.691
You seem a little young to be an editor.

27:11.763 --> 27:14.493
Yeah, well, you seem kind of young
to have a book being published.

27:14.566 --> 27:16.227
Well, fair enough.

27:18.203 --> 27:21.468
The truth is, your novel's my first.

27:21.539 --> 27:24.167
I graduated last year,
my dad runs the company,

27:24.242 --> 27:27.268
but I need to prove myself
like everyone else. Maybe more.

27:27.345 --> 27:32.408
- I know how that is.
- Luke, I don't care who your father is.

27:32.484 --> 27:37.319
I read a lot of manuscripts, but yours was
the first one that actually spoke to me.

27:37.389 --> 27:42.918
I mean, yeah, there's some rough parts,
but your writing has truth, soul.

27:43.161 --> 27:44.560
Rough parts?

27:45.463 --> 27:48.830
Look, I promise, as your editor,
I'll always be faithful to your voice,

27:48.900 --> 27:50.561
but there's some work to do.

27:50.635 --> 27:54.230
It'll take six months before it's ready
for publication. Maybe a little longer.

27:54.305 --> 27:55.704
- That long?
- Yeah.

27:55.774 --> 27:59.301
We're talking late hours,
long nights, heated arguments.

28:00.011 --> 28:02.707
It'll probably feel like we're married.

28:03.281 --> 28:06.648
- That was a joke.
- It's just been a long day, that's all.

28:06.985 --> 28:10.716
Well, then you better get some rest,
'cause we start on Monday.

28:10.789 --> 28:14.316
Hey, Lindsey, wait.
I just wanted to say thank you

28:14.693 --> 28:17.491
for changing my life.

28:18.563 --> 28:22.363
That was all you, Lucas.
But can I ask you something?

28:22.934 --> 28:24.026
Yeah.

28:24.736 --> 28:28.228
- The Luke and Peyton in the novel...
- No.

28:29.607 --> 28:30.733
Huh.

28:31.009 --> 28:35.742
I'm sorry. I was rooting for them.
See you Monday.

28:37.849 --> 28:40.113
Excuse me, Mr. Scott.
There's someone here to see you.

28:40.185 --> 28:43.018
She said to tell you she's from Tree Hill.

28:47.659 --> 28:51.322
- Well, well, Lucas Scott.
- You got my message.

28:51.663 --> 28:53.961
Oh, you think I was gonna miss a chance

28:54.032 --> 28:57.763
to spend a night on the town
with a soon-to-be best-selling author?

28:57.836 --> 29:00.896
- God, it is good to see you, Brooke.
- Yeah.

29:02.207 --> 29:05.768
BROOKE: So then my mom moved up here
with me from L.A.,

29:05.844 --> 29:07.869
'cause my dad travels so much.

29:07.946 --> 29:12.713
Well, I think they should just man up
and call it what it is. Trial separation.

29:13.752 --> 29:15.743
I can't believe your book's
gonna be published.

29:15.820 --> 29:17.583
You're gonna be such a rock star.

29:17.655 --> 29:19.748
Come on, you're the one
with the big clothing line.

29:19.824 --> 29:24.727
True, but my mom thinks we can do better
with that, too. Check this out.

29:26.097 --> 29:29.225
It's her plans to take Clothes Over Bro's
to the next level.

29:29.300 --> 29:34.602
We have high-end couture, a cosmetic
company, and my own magazine.

29:36.007 --> 29:37.702
<i>- B. Davis?</i>
- Hmm.

29:38.276 --> 29:42.007
Hey, wait. Then you can give my book
its first good review.

29:43.515 --> 29:47.076
You know, sometimes expanding
seems like a good idea,

29:47.585 --> 29:49.382
and sometimes, I don't know.

29:49.454 --> 29:52.821
It's the most time I've spent with my mom
since the maternity ward,

29:52.891 --> 29:53.949
but I'm scared if I let her in,

29:54.025 --> 29:56.516
Clothes Over Bro's isn't gonna be
mine anymore, you know?

29:56.594 --> 30:01.327
Yeah, I know what you mean.
There's this editor, Lindsey.

30:01.833 --> 30:05.234
And she just wants to make all these
changes to my novel, and...

30:05.303 --> 30:07.533
Pretty high-class problems we got.

30:07.605 --> 30:10.199
We should be celebrating,
not complaining. Where's Peyton?

30:10.275 --> 30:12.641
She must be so thrilled for you.

30:14.212 --> 30:16.737
- We broke up.
- Shut up.

30:19.918 --> 30:23.615
Oh, Luke, I'm sorry. What happened?

30:24.789 --> 30:28.987
I went to L.A., I asked her to marry me,
and she said no.

30:31.596 --> 30:32.620
(EX CLAIMS)

30:32.697 --> 30:34.221
Are you stupid?

30:34.666 --> 30:39.103
You stormed L.A.
And you went all Naley on her?

30:39.270 --> 30:41.067
Did you even buy a...

30:42.607 --> 30:43.869
...ring?

30:45.143 --> 30:48.044
- Oh.
- She never even saw it.

30:50.181 --> 30:53.014
How do you propose to someone
without them seeing the ring?

30:53.084 --> 30:56.520
Well, I got down on one knee,

30:56.588 --> 31:01.287
and I said I want us
to be together forever.

31:03.194 --> 31:04.183
(DOOR OPENS)

31:05.597 --> 31:06.586
(GASPS)

31:09.534 --> 31:12.264
Never mind, you definitely did it right.

31:13.204 --> 31:15.229
(BROOKE LAUGHING)

31:15.306 --> 31:16.796
I mean, did you see the look on her face?

31:16.875 --> 31:18.809
It's like somebody spewed
on her Jimmy Choos.

31:18.877 --> 31:21.345
- I'm really glad you're enjoying this.
- Oh, come on, Luke.

31:21.412 --> 31:23.676
You and Peyton'll work it out.

31:23.915 --> 31:26.645
I don't think so, Brooke. Not this time.

31:26.951 --> 31:29.351
Well, sounds to me like you gave her
an ultimatum,

31:29.420 --> 31:33.117
and trust me,
there is no quicker way to paralyze a girl.

31:34.525 --> 31:35.617
Okay,

31:36.961 --> 31:40.658
how many times have you talked
to Peyton since you left L. A?

31:41.666 --> 31:44.396
That's not fair. We're both really busy.

31:44.736 --> 31:47.569
And today,
she broke up with her boyfriend.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.806
Has she called you yet?

31:52.143 --> 31:53.576
Things have changed.

31:53.645 --> 31:56.011
I think you're saying that
because you're hurt.

31:56.080 --> 31:59.345
And I get it,
but I don't think you really mean it.

32:01.653 --> 32:04.520
You know what?
I think we need to get drunk.

32:04.589 --> 32:06.887
Really, really good and drunk.

32:08.293 --> 32:12.457
First, let me see the ring again.
I'll give you a designer's opinion.

32:15.833 --> 32:17.824
I mean, it's really nice.

32:18.569 --> 32:22.630
Well, well, congratulations.
Champagne on the house.

32:22.707 --> 32:25.175
- Oh, it's not...
- We have an engagement.

32:26.644 --> 32:27.906
No, I...

32:29.681 --> 32:31.581
Champagne on the house.

32:41.492 --> 32:45.986
So who knew that the ring trick
would get us free drinks all over midtown?

32:46.297 --> 32:47.491
I know.

32:48.666 --> 32:54.332
- Can I give you two a ride?
- Why not. It is our engagement night.

32:55.807 --> 32:58.605
In that case, the ride's free.

32:59.444 --> 33:01.810
The diamond ring is gold!

33:08.152 --> 33:11.713
So, what do you two have planned
for your lives together?

33:11.956 --> 33:13.218
Um...

33:13.391 --> 33:15.154
We're gonna be a power couple.

33:15.226 --> 33:18.821
He's gonna be a famous novelist, and
I'm gonna have a fabulous fashion line.

33:18.896 --> 33:21.126
But we're still gonna have time
to have a big family.

33:21.199 --> 33:23.599
- Two boys and a girl.
- And I'll coach little league.

33:23.668 --> 33:26.933
Oh, and I'll bake treats for the team.
Or buy them.

33:27.405 --> 33:29.965
Then we'll spend our summer
in our beach house.

33:30.041 --> 33:33.033
- And winters in the south of France.
- But it won't matter where we are,

33:33.111 --> 33:34.510
as long as we're together.

33:34.579 --> 33:35.841
DRIVER: That's the key.

33:35.913 --> 33:40.680
Success is wonderful, but finding someone
to love, having them love you back...

33:40.785 --> 33:42.912
Love is what it's all about.

33:51.162 --> 33:52.151
(EX CLAIMS)

33:52.997 --> 33:58.060
All right, boozy. Let's get you to bed.
Come on.

33:59.570 --> 34:03.666
Here we go. Okay, all right.

34:04.075 --> 34:06.270
- The bed is spinning.
- You're gonna be okay.

34:06.344 --> 34:09.938
I'm gonna get you into some jammies,
and then I'm gonna take a cab home,

34:10.014 --> 34:12.005
and you can sleep it off.

34:12.083 --> 34:15.678
- Come here.
- Or you could stay.

34:19.157 --> 34:20.248
Okay.

34:21.426 --> 34:26.362
I think that might be the second stupidest
thing you've done in the last 24 hours.

34:27.632 --> 34:29.759
Luke, we're not in high school anymore.

34:29.833 --> 34:34.498
And I love Peyton, and even if you don't
wanna admit it right now, so do you.

34:35.005 --> 34:36.098
Okay?

34:36.940 --> 34:40.877
I feel lost, Brooke,
I don't know what to do without her.

34:42.679 --> 34:46.241
All right. You remember
when I started Clothes Over Bro's?

34:46.317 --> 34:48.114
It was right after we broke up.

34:48.186 --> 34:52.213
And I was trying to mend
my broken heart by focusing on my work.

34:53.190 --> 34:54.987
And you need to do the same right now.

34:55.059 --> 34:57.186
You need to go out there
and become the best person

34:57.261 --> 34:59.627
and the best writer that you can be.

34:59.697 --> 35:02.564
And then you approach Peyton,

35:03.701 --> 35:07.000
and if she comes back to you,
you know it's meant to be.

35:07.305 --> 35:08.397
Okay?

35:09.941 --> 35:10.930
(SNIFFLES)

35:11.042 --> 35:15.536
I'm gonna go, and you probably
won't see me for a while.

35:20.017 --> 35:24.784
Lucas Scott is gonna change the world
someday, and he doesn't even know it yet.

35:29.861 --> 35:31.351
Goodbye, Luke.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.483
I've been calling you all night.

35:55.953 --> 35:58.854
Maybe teen marriage is all the rage
in Hicksville, North Carolina,

35:58.923 --> 36:00.823
but I swear if you marry this boy,

36:00.892 --> 36:02.792
I'm gonna have annulment papers
drawn up so fast...

36:02.860 --> 36:05.158
Mom, relax. It was just a joke.

36:07.632 --> 36:12.729
Oh, thank God.
You have far too much to lose, Brooke.

36:12.803 --> 36:13.792
(BROOKE SCOFFS)

36:14.405 --> 36:17.135
And Lucas Scott was the one boy
I might've lost it for.

36:17.208 --> 36:21.201
You should be focusing on the company,
not boys with rings.

36:22.713 --> 36:27.082
But what about love, Mom?
Isn't that the key?

36:27.718 --> 36:31.154
In case you've forgotten,
it's called Clothes Over Bro's.

36:32.690 --> 36:33.850
Right.

36:36.460 --> 36:37.927
Okay, I'm in.

36:38.563 --> 36:41.691
The high-end line, the magazine,
I'm ready to take it to the next level.

36:41.766 --> 36:45.202
Oh, I am so glad to hear you say that.

36:47.305 --> 36:52.038
And I promise you, darling, we are going
to have everything we've ever wanted.

36:56.147 --> 36:58.377
Oh, and by the way, call me Victoria.

36:58.449 --> 37:01.714
That whole "Mom" thing
just makes me sound too old.

37:07.959 --> 37:11.952
Hey, say it again, buddy.
What is this, huh? Ball. Ball.

37:12.296 --> 37:14.662
Oh, see. I'm telling you,
the kid's gonna be a rock star.

37:14.732 --> 37:16.700
And a very well-behaved rock star, right?

37:16.767 --> 37:20.567
Hey, Jamie, guitar. Guitar.

37:21.372 --> 37:23.636
- Ball.
- That's not fair.

37:23.708 --> 37:26.142
"Ball" is so much easier than "guitar."

37:28.479 --> 37:30.970
Haley, thank you for supporting me

37:31.349 --> 37:34.944
and helping me get my dream back.
I love you so much.

37:35.486 --> 37:39.286
I love you, too. I'm so proud of you.

37:40.191 --> 37:43.627
We're gonna make it. And nothing's
gonna stop us now, huh, buddy?

37:43.694 --> 37:44.820
Is it? Is it, Jamie?

37:44.895 --> 37:47.125
- That's right.
- Nothing, buddy.

37:49.267 --> 37:50.757
- You want to climb on daddy?
- Nice!

37:50.835 --> 37:52.427
Everybody climb on daddy. Come on.

37:52.503 --> 37:53.731
Oh, no!

38:23.100 --> 38:24.692
Hey, come on in.

38:30.641 --> 38:32.973
- What's that?
- It's a bamboo.

38:33.744 --> 38:37.771
- It's supposed to bring luck.
- Thanks, Lucas. I love it.

38:40.951 --> 38:43.784
You know, I'm really looking forward
to us working together.

38:43.854 --> 38:47.153
- Me, too.
- Have a seat, okay? I'll be right back.

39:08.379 --> 39:09.607
(SIGHS)

39:17.722 --> 39:20.885
Hey, you still taking
a trip down memory lane?

39:22.793 --> 39:24.158
Yeah, I guess.

39:24.228 --> 39:28.187
Maybe you should put it on paper,
might make us both some money.

39:31.369 --> 39:35.328
Actually, I was thinking
about taking a walk.

39:43.981 --> 39:45.312
What are you doing?

39:45.383 --> 39:49.615
Oh, just thought it was time to get these
out of Jamie's closet.

39:49.687 --> 39:52.087
He's proud of his daddy. So am I.

39:54.358 --> 39:59.295
- That's the first Cobra championship.
- Yeah. You were so great in that game.

40:00.931 --> 40:04.094
You should never be ashamed
of your achievements.

40:06.170 --> 40:10.698
The only thing I'm ashamed of is the
person I've been for the past few months.

40:10.775 --> 40:12.743
That's all gonna change.

40:14.044 --> 40:18.174
Hey. I know we're not the couple
we used to be.

40:19.617 --> 40:22.586
We're gonna get there. I know it.

40:36.267 --> 40:38.497
This is a surprise. What's up?

40:39.069 --> 40:43.233
- Not much. Is Peyton around?
- No, I think she's at the studio today.

40:46.143 --> 40:47.405
You okay?

40:47.945 --> 40:50.743
Yeah, you remember that night
in New York?

40:50.848 --> 40:53.112
The night I found out
my book was published?

40:53.184 --> 40:56.984
Sure. It's the same night I went
into business with Victoria.

40:57.087 --> 40:58.076
(EX CLAIMS)

40:58.956 --> 41:01.857
You ever wonder
if we chose the right paths?

41:02.193 --> 41:06.653
Sometimes. But I have all these wonderful
things in my life.

41:07.298 --> 41:09.357
Things I wouldn't have had otherwise.

41:09.433 --> 41:12.129
No, you're right. You're right. Me, too.

41:13.304 --> 41:14.771
I don't know.

41:15.840 --> 41:17.501
Do you want me to tell Peyton
you came by?

41:17.575 --> 41:21.375
No, that's okay. I'll see you, Brooke.

41:22.746 --> 41:23.974
See you.

41:25.249 --> 41:27.911
- Luke?
- Yeah?

41:28.486 --> 41:31.580
You still love her, don't you? Peyton?

41:34.325 --> 41:36.452
I gotta get back to Lindsey.

41:40.397 --> 41:41.557
Right.

41:45.669 --> 41:48.137
This is gonna get interesting.
