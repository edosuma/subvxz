00:02.723 --> 00:04.022
Here goes. And, uh,

00:04.046 --> 00:06.420
this is the part
I always leave out.

00:08.042 --> 00:12.246
I had missed my curfew
the second time that week,

00:13.286 --> 00:15.254
and when I got home,
it was crazy late.

00:15.321 --> 00:17.389
It was like 3:00
in the morning,

00:17.457 --> 00:19.057
and my parents weren't home,

00:19.347 --> 00:21.248
and the phone rang,

00:21.316 --> 00:23.884
and my life stopped.

00:25.676 --> 00:28.645
My parents were killed
by a drunk driver

00:28.713 --> 00:30.447
when they were out
looking for me.

00:30.514 --> 00:34.951
And if they hadn't been out
looking for me, then...

00:35.019 --> 00:36.920
[Takes deep breath]

00:39.357 --> 00:43.360
We all have wounds
that we want to heal.

00:43.427 --> 00:46.296
That's why we come here
every week, right?

00:46.364 --> 00:49.532
And I have to believe
that as we keep coming here

00:49.600 --> 00:51.801
and talking and revealing,

00:51.869 --> 00:55.271
that eventually, in time,

00:55.339 --> 01:00.744
even the deepest wounds
we carry will begin to heal.

01:02.546 --> 01:05.749
Monica, is there something
you want to say?

01:05.816 --> 01:06.816
Huh? Um...

01:08.419 --> 01:10.086
Sorry.

01:12.556 --> 01:15.558
But I believe that time...

01:17.428 --> 01:19.062
Wears you down.

01:21.665 --> 01:24.434
A few weeks ago...

01:24.502 --> 01:28.938
I walked by the bakery
that we used to go to...

01:29.006 --> 01:34.244
And I saw this...
little girl with blond pigtails.

01:34.311 --> 01:36.613
[Crying]

01:36.680 --> 01:38.748
I'm sorry. I can't.

01:38.816 --> 01:41.418
Don't be sorry.
It's totally ok.

01:41.485 --> 01:43.787
That's why we're all here.

01:43.854 --> 01:48.191
I think that's enough
for tonight.

01:48.259 --> 01:50.794
I'm going to
wrap it up. Ok?

01:50.861 --> 01:52.295
Thank you all for coming.

01:52.363 --> 01:55.632
I look forward
to seeing you next week.

02:03.651 --> 02:05.281
Hey, Mon, what's the rush?

02:05.306 --> 02:06.706
I thought you wanted
to talk to me.

02:06.977 --> 02:09.245
It's all right.
It's just been a long week.

02:09.312 --> 02:11.848
Yeah, it's only Monday.
What's going on?

02:13.284 --> 02:16.920
Yesterday was the anniversary
of Hope's disappearance.

02:16.987 --> 02:18.254
Oh, God, that's ri--

02:18.322 --> 02:21.925
I'm so sorry. I for--
why didn't you say something?

02:21.992 --> 02:24.427
I didn't want to relive it
with the group.

02:24.495 --> 02:25.695
Once was enough.

02:25.763 --> 02:26.863
Ok, I totally understand.

02:26.931 --> 02:29.065
Do you want to grab
a late dinner and talk?

02:29.133 --> 02:31.067
No,'m good.
You go enjoy.

02:31.135 --> 02:32.735
I promise,
we'll talk later.

02:32.803 --> 02:34.270
Are you sure you're ok?

02:34.338 --> 02:35.839
Yeah.

Girl: Dear mommy,
please don't tell the police.

03:00.764 --> 03:03.032
If he finds out
I'm writing you,

03:03.100 --> 03:04.434
he'll kill me.

03:06.837 --> 03:09.439
I see you got
one of those, too.

03:11.208 --> 03:15.211
What?! That's Hope.

03:17.314 --> 03:18.982
Oh, my God.

03:19.049 --> 03:20.316
Who put this here?

03:20.384 --> 03:22.852
I saw a man and a young woman
putting them on cars.

03:22.920 --> 03:23.887
Well, they--
well, where did they go?

03:23.954 --> 03:25.355
Did you see
what they looked like?

03:25.422 --> 03:28.057
They were headed out of the
parking lot by the time I saw them.

03:28.125 --> 03:30.360
Wait! They couldn't have
gotten far. We'll take my car.

03:30.427 --> 03:32.395
It's right here.

03:32.463 --> 03:33.530
Come on.

03:43.574 --> 03:46.042
Ok. Ok, so wait.
So you're saying

03:46.110 --> 03:48.845
it's literally just
doubling up on the flour?

03:48.913 --> 03:49.846
Exactly.

03:49.947 --> 03:51.214
Oh, God,
that's genius.

03:51.282 --> 03:53.516
Ok, it won't be a molten mass
next week, I promise.

03:53.584 --> 03:56.085
See ya.
I'll see you next week.

04:24.081 --> 04:25.949
What about those two?

04:26.016 --> 04:28.418
No, it's not them.

04:28.485 --> 04:30.386
What about them?

04:30.454 --> 04:34.224
To be honest, I think
we might have missed them.

04:34.291 --> 04:35.925
No, I need to find them.

04:38.596 --> 04:41.397
I can't imagine how hard
yesterday was for you.

04:41.465 --> 04:43.433
What?

04:43.500 --> 04:44.500
I'll bet since
you got that letter,

04:44.568 --> 04:47.003
you've read it
a hundred times.

04:49.840 --> 04:52.275
How do you
know about the letter?

04:55.846 --> 04:58.948
'Cause I'm the one
who took Hope.

happened here.

Right.

Ok, I'm here.
I'm right here.

06:16.564 --> 06:18.599
Is there any chance
Monica left with someone?

06:18.667 --> 06:20.768
No. No, not today.

06:20.835 --> 06:24.538
Yesterday was the anniversary
of her daughter's abduction.

06:24.606 --> 06:26.173
How long
have you known her?

06:26.241 --> 06:27.775
5 years.

06:27.842 --> 06:30.778
And her daughter was abducted.
Did they catch him?

06:30.845 --> 06:32.112
No. The case went cold.

06:32.180 --> 06:34.415
The police ran down
all kinds of leads. No dice.

06:34.482 --> 06:36.617
Garcia, you do know the effect

06:36.685 --> 06:38.952
anniversaries can have
on survivors, right?

06:39.020 --> 06:41.955
Are you insinuating that she
might have killed herself?

06:42.023 --> 06:44.015
She didn't. I know her.
She's a survivor.

06:44.040 --> 06:45.240
She wouldn't do that.

06:48.029 --> 06:49.963
It looks like
she left in a hurry.

06:50.031 --> 06:51.265
The keys are still
in the ignition.

06:51.332 --> 06:52.466
And she left her purse.

06:55.203 --> 06:57.337
What's that?

06:59.474 --> 07:02.609
It's a letter, signed
by somebody named Hope?

07:03.978 --> 07:05.813
That's her daughter.

07:15.657 --> 07:17.791
What do you mean,
you took Hope?

07:17.859 --> 07:20.627
Haven't you always wanted to
know what happened to her?

07:20.695 --> 07:23.430
Of course I do.
Where is she?

07:23.498 --> 07:26.967
Well, it's important that you
understand how it all began.

07:33.007 --> 07:34.675
Why are we here?

07:35.693 --> 07:37.461
Answer me.

07:37.529 --> 07:39.129
Ok, just tell me
where she is.

07:39.197 --> 07:41.598
I won't call
the police, I swear.

07:41.666 --> 07:43.300
Of course you won't,
because doing that

07:43.368 --> 07:45.502
would guarantee
you'll never see her again.

07:50.724 --> 07:53.727
You recognize this place?

07:55.013 --> 07:57.948
We used to stop here
for gas on the way home.

07:58.016 --> 08:00.818
It's also the first place
I met Hope.

08:00.885 --> 08:02.486
You wouldn't buy this
for her.

08:02.554 --> 08:04.988
Do you remember
how upset she was?

08:05.056 --> 08:07.591
Mommy, please.

08:07.659 --> 08:09.593
Please, mommy.
I believe your exact words

08:09.661 --> 08:13.764
were, "What part of no
do you not understand?

08:13.832 --> 08:15.866
Go put it back."

08:15.934 --> 08:17.701
I didn't want her
to ruin her dinner.

08:21.639 --> 08:24.208
She made a choice not to
take candy from a stranger.

08:24.275 --> 08:25.742
No, thank you.

08:25.810 --> 08:28.679
And in that moment,

08:28.746 --> 08:31.648
I made a choice, too.

08:31.716 --> 08:33.217
I had to have her.

08:33.284 --> 08:35.119
Where did you take her?

08:35.186 --> 08:37.187
We all make choices,
Monica.

08:37.255 --> 08:39.222
You can choose
to walk out that door

08:39.289 --> 08:41.725
or you can come with me.

09:18.863 --> 09:22.432
Take me to my baby.

09:22.500 --> 09:24.101
I got you something.

09:24.169 --> 09:26.937
It's still her favorite.

09:36.614 --> 09:38.415
Garcia, I'll do
the case presentation.

09:38.483 --> 09:40.417
Oh, no, sir,
I can do it.

09:40.485 --> 09:41.418
I got it.

09:41.486 --> 09:43.554
- Thank you, sir.- No problem.

09:50.195 --> 09:52.462
7 years ago yesterday
at Manassas, Virginia,

09:52.530 --> 09:55.465
8-year-old Hope Kingston was
abducted from her front yard

09:55.533 --> 09:57.134
while playing with a friend.

09:57.202 --> 09:58.635
She's been presumed dead.

09:58.703 --> 10:00.637
A few hours ago,
her mother Monica

10:00.705 --> 10:01.972
disappeared
from a parking lot

10:02.040 --> 10:04.007
after attending Garcia's
victims support group.

10:04.075 --> 10:05.570
It's not uncommon for unsubs

10:05.595 --> 10:07.670
to reach out and contact
relatives of victims.

10:07.845 --> 10:11.081
Joran Van Der Sloot extorted $25,000
from Natalee Holloway's mother

10:11.149 --> 10:12.583
in exchange
for information.

10:12.650 --> 10:14.952
Do we think both
abductions were related?

10:15.019 --> 10:18.288
I found a letter signed
by Hope inside Monica's car.

10:18.356 --> 10:20.290
The anniversary could
have been the trigger.

10:20.358 --> 10:21.658
We can't rule out
the possibility

10:21.726 --> 10:23.794
that Monica
committed suicide.

10:23.861 --> 10:27.331
No. No, Monica would--
would never hurt herself.

10:27.398 --> 10:30.167
She--she still thought
Hope was alive.

10:30.235 --> 10:31.501
Is the father
in the picture?

10:31.569 --> 10:33.170
No, he died
in a car accident

10:33.238 --> 10:34.504
right before Hope was born.

10:34.572 --> 10:36.773
There's no postmark,

10:36.841 --> 10:39.176
which means this letter
was obviously hand-delivered.

10:39.244 --> 10:40.677
You do a full
linguistic analysis.

10:40.745 --> 10:42.145
We need to determine
authenticity.

10:42.213 --> 10:44.147
There's a butterfly drawn
next to Hope's name.

10:44.215 --> 10:45.515
That has to mean something.

10:45.617 --> 10:47.684
There was no sign of
struggle at the scene.

10:47.752 --> 10:49.186
What if she went willingly?

10:49.254 --> 10:51.888
He could have approached her
and had Hope with him.

10:51.956 --> 10:54.024
That would certainly
get her attention.

10:54.092 --> 10:56.727
Still, it's pretty high-risk
to abduct in such a high-traffic area.

10:56.794 --> 10:58.629
The parking lot was right
next to a strip mall.

10:58.696 --> 11:00.664
Any witnesses?

11:00.732 --> 11:02.499
I was the last person
that saw her.

11:02.567 --> 11:04.735
Unless we have reason
to believe otherwise,

11:04.802 --> 11:06.336
we should assume that the
same unsub is responsible

11:06.404 --> 11:07.571
for both abductions.

11:07.639 --> 11:09.406
Let's get started.

11:15.713 --> 11:18.849
Why did you bring me
back here?

11:18.916 --> 11:22.219
To show you how her life
with me began.

11:22.287 --> 11:25.455
It brings back a lot
of memories, doesn't it?

11:27.058 --> 11:28.859
You followed us home.

11:28.926 --> 11:33.163
She used to run around
for hours. Remember?

11:33.231 --> 11:35.499
Like a...
[Chattering and laughing]

11:35.566 --> 11:38.068
young butterfly
floating in the wind,

11:38.136 --> 11:41.305
just a vision of beauty.

11:41.372 --> 11:43.240
No peeking this time.

11:43.308 --> 11:45.342
Ready or not,
here I come!

11:45.410 --> 11:48.145
I got so wrapped up
in watching them,

11:48.212 --> 11:50.681
I almost forgot
why I was there.

11:50.748 --> 11:53.050
Monica.

11:53.117 --> 11:55.485
We all have choices,
remember?

11:57.088 --> 11:59.022
I thought that was you.

11:59.090 --> 12:00.257
Everything all right?

12:00.325 --> 12:03.527
Yeah. Uh, we were just
driving by.

12:03.594 --> 12:05.495
At this time of night?

12:05.563 --> 12:08.899
I didn't--I didn't
realize how late it was.

12:08.966 --> 12:10.534
You sure you're all right?

12:10.601 --> 12:12.803
Yeah, I'm fine.
We were just leaving.

12:25.216 --> 12:27.818
It's rare that parents
of a missing child

12:27.885 --> 12:29.820
would leave the home
they shared.

12:29.887 --> 12:31.888
From what Garcia said,
she didn't have a choice.

12:31.956 --> 12:34.424
She focused her resources
on finding Hope.

12:34.492 --> 12:37.794
The mortgage
took a back seat.

12:37.862 --> 12:40.997
But she still wanted to stay close
to the home she shared with Hope.

12:41.065 --> 12:43.667
So she moved
to an apartment nearby.

12:43.735 --> 12:45.769
Lights are on a timer.

12:45.837 --> 12:47.671
Yeah, in case
Hope came home.

12:47.739 --> 12:51.675
Which means
there's probably...

12:51.743 --> 12:53.777
A key under the mat.

12:53.845 --> 12:57.147
That's risky for a single woman,
leaving a key out like that.

12:57.215 --> 12:58.886
If he stalked her,
he would have had

12:58.911 --> 13:01.168
complete access to her here.

13:01.252 --> 13:03.854
But he waited and abducted her
in public.

13:03.921 --> 13:07.691
The same way that
he took her daughter.

13:09.394 --> 13:12.129
So this letter Monica allegedly
received from her daughter

13:12.196 --> 13:13.830
contains no indication
of female authorship.

13:13.898 --> 13:16.333
It lacks expression
of emotional attachment.

13:16.401 --> 13:17.534
The unsub wrote it?

13:17.602 --> 13:18.969
I believe so. The language used
is inconsistent

13:19.036 --> 13:21.371
with that of a 15-year-old
held in captivity for 7 years.

13:21.439 --> 13:24.378
Uh, I just got a hit
on someone who matches

13:24.403 --> 13:25.603
Monica's description

13:25.910 --> 13:29.012
at a gas station 17 miles
outside of Manassas.

13:34.152 --> 13:35.819
Hope's not with him.

13:35.887 --> 13:38.422
Reid: It looks like they're
having a conversation.

13:38.489 --> 13:40.857
She's cooperating.
Garcia, can you get any closer?

13:40.925 --> 13:43.660
No. No, I can't get
a good look at him.

13:43.728 --> 13:44.995
Reid: Look at his body language.

13:45.062 --> 13:46.496
He's shielding himself
from the cameras.

13:46.564 --> 13:48.965
He knows where they are.
He's protecting his identity.

13:49.033 --> 13:52.302
Why isn't Monica
asking for help?

13:52.370 --> 13:54.337
She doesn't want to draw
attention to herself.

13:54.439 --> 13:56.840
Reid: She leaves,
but the unsub stays?

13:56.908 --> 13:58.341
Garcia: I don't understand.

13:58.409 --> 13:59.976
He's got complete control.
He's not worried

14:00.044 --> 14:01.511
about her contacting
the authorities.

14:01.579 --> 14:04.181
Garcia, run the pump receipts
against the timeline.

14:04.248 --> 14:06.249
Maybe he used a credit card.

14:06.317 --> 14:09.252
Pumps one...through 9.

14:09.320 --> 14:12.756
Nothing. Who goes to a gas station
and doesn't buy anything?

14:12.824 --> 14:15.459
There are plenty of service stations
between the community center and here,

14:15.526 --> 14:17.294
but he drove her
clear across town.

14:17.361 --> 14:19.663
This place must mean something
to the both of them.

14:19.730 --> 14:21.097
This could be where
it all started.

14:24.635 --> 14:26.770
Here we are.

14:26.838 --> 14:29.873
Home sweet home.

14:29.941 --> 14:33.276
I pass by this street every day
on my way home from work.

14:33.344 --> 14:35.445
7.2 miles door to door.

14:35.513 --> 14:39.416
I can't believe you've had
her here this whole time.

14:48.125 --> 14:49.593
Oh, my God.

15:00.471 --> 15:02.772
Oh, my God.

15:06.143 --> 15:09.279
I love that picture of Hope.
She's so photogenic.

15:09.347 --> 15:10.947
I need to see her.

15:12.350 --> 15:13.583
It's getting late.

15:13.651 --> 15:16.253
I've done everything
you've asked.

15:18.656 --> 15:20.357
Come with me.

15:26.998 --> 15:28.231
Anything?

15:28.299 --> 15:29.966
She was there,
but we just missed her.

15:30.034 --> 15:31.434
The owner of Monica's
old house reported

15:31.502 --> 15:32.903
seeing her parked outside
just 2 hours ago.

15:32.970 --> 15:34.129
Was the unsub with her?

15:34.130 --> 15:35.645
Yeah, but he didn't
get much of a description

15:35.670 --> 15:37.086
on the unsub or the truck.

15:37.176 --> 15:39.444
He did say Monica
had been by a lot recently.

15:39.677 --> 15:41.311
Apparently somebody dropped
a letter for her a week ago.

15:41.379 --> 15:42.812
The owner called her
to come pick it up,

15:42.880 --> 15:44.981
and ever since then she's been
parked outside the house.

15:45.049 --> 15:47.450
What's this guy
doing with her?

15:47.518 --> 15:48.985
If he's had Hope captive
for 7 years,

15:49.053 --> 15:50.487
she's completely
compliant by now.

15:50.555 --> 15:52.856
He might have abducted Monica
as a reward for good behavior.

15:52.924 --> 15:55.659
Or he could be
getting off on the fact

15:55.726 --> 15:58.328
that he successfully abducted
a mother and a daughter.

15:58.396 --> 16:00.664
Monica's statement the day
of Hope's abduction

16:00.731 --> 16:03.433
confirmed that she made
a purchase at the same gas station

16:03.501 --> 16:05.001
hours before
Hope went missing.

16:05.069 --> 16:07.671
It's not a coincidence
that he brought Monica

16:07.738 --> 16:10.273
from that particular gas
station to her old house.

16:10.341 --> 16:12.842
He's taking her through all the
steps of Hope's abduction.

16:12.910 --> 16:15.078
Having both of them could
have been his plan all along.

16:15.146 --> 16:17.280
So are we saying
he's sexually diverse,

16:17.348 --> 16:20.116
attracted to children
and adults?

16:20.184 --> 16:21.851
The unsub stalked Monica,

16:21.919 --> 16:24.588
so he knew about
the spare key under the mat.

16:24.655 --> 16:26.189
He had complete access.

16:26.257 --> 16:29.159
So why wait 7 years
to circle back if that's the case?

16:29.260 --> 16:30.827
The butterfly could
symbolically represent

16:30.895 --> 16:33.997
not just transformation
but maturation of his erotic ideal.

16:34.065 --> 16:36.299
Well, he started
with easy targets.

16:36.367 --> 16:39.202
Children are much easier
to abduct, manipulate, and control.

16:39.270 --> 16:40.954
Or he could be
a preferential offender

16:41.022 --> 16:43.456
and a situational child molester,
meaning adult woman have always

16:43.524 --> 16:44.958
been his preference, but
given the right circumstances

16:45.026 --> 16:46.159
he'd offend against a child.

16:46.227 --> 16:47.494
Monica's not a preference.

16:47.561 --> 16:48.828
She's a specific target.

16:48.896 --> 16:50.964
Rossi: He didn't go after
just any woman,

16:51.032 --> 16:52.465
he went after Hope's mother.

16:52.533 --> 16:55.302
Which means that Hope
is probably dead

16:55.369 --> 16:58.371
and he's taken Monica
because she reminds him of Hope.

17:00.241 --> 17:02.988
This is everything
the Manassas P.D. had

17:03.013 --> 17:04.608
on Hope's investigation.

17:04.779 --> 17:06.212
All right, let's get to work.

17:10.651 --> 17:13.619
Wait, please!

17:24.098 --> 17:27.067
Rise and shine.

17:49.457 --> 17:50.757
How did you sleep?

17:52.393 --> 17:54.160
I didn't.

17:55.429 --> 17:58.398
Oh, Hope grew out of those
when she was 12,

17:58.466 --> 18:01.368
but I didn't need to use them
on her much after that.

18:01.435 --> 18:04.104
So I have water, orange juice,

18:04.171 --> 18:05.105
milk--

18:05.172 --> 18:06.573
She's not here, is she?

18:08.943 --> 18:11.211
Why would I bring you here
if that was the case?

18:11.278 --> 18:14.013
Then prove it.
I want to see her!

18:27.661 --> 18:30.063
Go ahead.

18:30.131 --> 18:32.332
Have a look.

18:44.678 --> 18:47.080
[Crying] Hope.

18:47.148 --> 18:50.650
Hope: Sorry, Bill.
I'll do it better next time.

19:03.030 --> 19:04.316
So, what's the word, genius?

19:04.317 --> 19:06.401
I may have been able to narrow down
the unsub's comfort zone.

19:06.486 --> 19:08.076
The gas station was the third
point I needed to complete

19:08.101 --> 19:09.301
the geographical profile.

19:09.522 --> 19:11.774
Factoring in Monica's
abduction site and her apartment,

19:11.858 --> 19:14.276
I would assume the unsub lives
somewhere within this area.

19:14.393 --> 19:16.078
That would make it easier for him
to learn her routines.

19:16.162 --> 19:17.996
That zone can't be
more than 20 miles.

19:18.064 --> 19:19.498
All right, so all
the local employees

19:19.565 --> 19:21.366
that were on duty
last night checked out.

19:21.417 --> 19:22.567
Nobody saw a thing.

19:22.619 --> 19:24.086
You know, it looks like
there are 5 different

19:24.170 --> 19:25.607
reported incidents
that we might be able

19:25.632 --> 19:27.141
to attribute to this unsub.

19:27.406 --> 19:29.424
When was the first case
reported?

19:29.509 --> 19:32.628
6 months before
Hope's abduction.

19:32.712 --> 19:35.097
A 12-year-old girl
in the area reported a man

19:35.181 --> 19:37.432
taking pictures of her
on her way home from school,

19:37.517 --> 19:38.666
and 3 weeks after that,

19:38.691 --> 19:40.562
she thought he was peeping
into her window.

19:40.770 --> 19:42.721
And then her house
was burglarized,

19:42.772 --> 19:45.107
and the only thing that was
missing were her clothes.

19:45.191 --> 19:48.277
Well, if that's him, then there was
a clear escalation in his M.O.

19:48.394 --> 19:50.529
He was building his confidence
to abduct Hope

19:50.596 --> 19:52.364
and then 7 years later, Monica.

19:52.431 --> 19:56.034
Hey, uh, these were found
on Heather Wilson's bike

19:56.102 --> 19:57.820
2 weeks after
Hope disappeared.

19:57.904 --> 20:01.123
That's the girl that Hope was
playing with when she was abducted.

20:01.207 --> 20:02.541
The butterfly again.

20:02.608 --> 20:05.294
"Without you, she wouldn't
have been set free.

20:05.378 --> 20:07.629
This is a token
of my appreciation"?

20:07.714 --> 20:11.449
He sent a thank-you card
to the girl he didn't abduct.

20:32.572 --> 20:34.940
This is what I saw.

20:37.643 --> 20:41.330
She was--she was here.

20:41.414 --> 20:44.833
She was just here.

20:44.918 --> 20:47.252
She wrote you
so many times.

20:47.320 --> 20:49.588
Where are you hiding her?!

20:49.655 --> 20:51.840
"Dear mommy, why don't you
come see me? I miss you."

20:51.925 --> 20:53.425
Go to hell!

20:53.492 --> 20:55.460
Anger's how you're
dealing with your guilt.

20:55.511 --> 20:57.512
- Hope!
- Hope was angry at first, too.

20:57.597 --> 20:59.514
Hope, if you're here,
say something! Mommy's here!

20:59.599 --> 21:01.516
You want to know
how I got her to calm down?

21:01.601 --> 21:04.303
[Crying]

21:04.354 --> 21:07.522
We used to play
a lot of games.

21:08.524 --> 21:10.142
What are you doing?

21:10.193 --> 21:14.229
Go ahead, I'll give you
a head start.

21:14.314 --> 21:15.981
1...

21:16.032 --> 21:17.849
2...

21:17.901 --> 21:19.201
3...

21:20.703 --> 21:23.288
Heather? I'm Agent Jareau.

21:23.356 --> 21:25.807
This is Agent Prentiss.
We're with the FBI.

21:25.875 --> 21:28.160
We have some questions
about Hope Kingston.

21:28.211 --> 21:29.411
Do you remember her?

21:29.495 --> 21:31.496
What do you think?

21:31.547 --> 21:33.031
I know you've been through
this before,

21:33.082 --> 21:34.633
but we need to talk
to you about that day.

21:34.700 --> 21:37.274
Heather, we have reason
to believe that the same man

21:37.275 --> 21:39.621
who took Hope abducted
her mother last night.

21:39.672 --> 21:42.540
This can't be
happening again.

21:42.592 --> 21:44.726
Did you and Hope
play together often?

21:44.811 --> 21:46.511
Every day.
She was like a sister.

21:46.562 --> 21:47.896
You told the police

21:47.981 --> 21:50.565
that you saw a man watching
you guys play that day.

21:50.650 --> 21:52.484
Look, I've been through
this a thousand times.

21:52.551 --> 21:54.332
I wish I could help you
more, I really do, but I

21:54.357 --> 21:55.720
gotta get to class now.

21:56.322 --> 21:59.024
You put streaks in your hair
because it's a constant reminder

21:59.075 --> 22:01.693
of how much
you two looked alike.

22:01.744 --> 22:03.895
You don't know
anything about me.

22:03.947 --> 22:06.581
I know that you struggle
to let people in

22:06.666 --> 22:08.617
because you're afraid
of losing them.

22:08.701 --> 22:10.752
And that you are
constantly asking yourself

22:10.837 --> 22:14.006
why he took Hope
instead of you?

22:14.073 --> 22:15.958
Are you done?

22:16.042 --> 22:18.677
Listen, if there's something
that you know,

22:18.744 --> 22:20.379
please tell us.

22:23.800 --> 22:27.019
It wasn't the first time
I had seen him.

22:27.086 --> 22:30.255
It was a week earlier when
Hope and I were at the park.

22:30.306 --> 22:32.975
- Did he say anything to you?
- No.

22:33.059 --> 22:35.694
Can you tell us about the day
Hope was abducted?

22:37.697 --> 22:41.817
Um...We were playing
hide-and-go-seek

22:41.901 --> 22:44.202
in front of her house.

22:44.270 --> 22:46.672
It's your turn.
Don't peek!

22:46.739 --> 22:48.507
[Crying] I had just
finished counting.

22:48.574 --> 22:51.777
Ready or not, here I come!

22:51.844 --> 22:53.312
And I turned around,

22:53.379 --> 22:55.514
and there he was...

22:55.581 --> 22:58.684
just standing there
smiling at me.

22:58.751 --> 23:01.953
He was holding a jar
of butterflies.

23:02.021 --> 23:04.289
He knew that would get
my attention.

23:04.357 --> 23:05.857
I'll be it, ok?
Go hide.

23:05.925 --> 23:08.626
And that's when he asked
if he could play.

23:08.678 --> 23:10.112
And I told him he could.

23:10.179 --> 23:11.380
1...

23:11.447 --> 23:13.315
2...

23:13.383 --> 23:14.950
3...

23:15.018 --> 23:16.785
Ready or not,
here I come.

23:16.853 --> 23:19.688
I'll never forget
that voice.

23:19.772 --> 23:21.773
Why didn't you
ever tell anyone?

23:24.027 --> 23:26.328
Because it was my fault.

23:26.412 --> 23:30.165
I'm the one who told him
that he could play with us.

23:30.249 --> 23:32.868
I overheard my dad saying

23:32.952 --> 23:36.988
that someone put
a butterfly necklace on my bike.

23:37.040 --> 23:41.293
Then he asked if I knew
who had put it there.

23:41.344 --> 23:44.346
It was my chance
to come clean...

23:44.430 --> 23:47.766
But I just kept
my mouth shut.

23:49.435 --> 23:53.171
[Sobbing]

24:01.731 --> 24:04.449
Hey. How you holding up?

24:04.517 --> 24:06.118
Oh...

24:07.853 --> 24:10.872
After Em, I never thought
I'd see another person

24:10.957 --> 24:11.957
I love up there.

24:12.024 --> 24:13.241
Baby, you gotta stop
blaming yourself.

24:13.326 --> 24:14.793
We're doing everything
we can to find her.

24:14.860 --> 24:17.129
No, we're not. We're not doing
enough to find her.

24:17.196 --> 24:18.580
If we we doing everything,
we would have found her.

24:18.664 --> 24:20.999
I'm not doing
everything I can.

24:21.067 --> 24:22.534
Every minute
that goes by,

24:22.585 --> 24:24.169
there's more chance
that she's dead.

24:24.220 --> 24:25.537
- Ok, Garcia, stop it.
- What?

24:25.588 --> 24:27.973
Stop it.
I need you to calm down.

24:28.040 --> 24:31.560
I am doing everything I can to
keep it together and I'm so scared.

24:31.644 --> 24:33.595
Ok, you need to listen
to me right now.

24:33.679 --> 24:35.313
Guys.

24:35.381 --> 24:38.100
We're ready to deliver
the profile.

24:45.608 --> 24:48.193
Penelope.

24:48.244 --> 24:50.445
Let's go find her.

24:56.169 --> 24:58.787
Ready or not, here I come.

25:16.689 --> 25:18.940
7 years ago we believed
our unsub to be

25:19.025 --> 25:20.609
a preferential
child molester.

25:20.693 --> 25:22.927
And now we think
that his preference evolved

25:22.979 --> 25:25.313
into an erotomanic
obsession with Hope Kingston.

25:25.398 --> 25:27.816
So much so
that in her absence,

25:27.900 --> 25:30.452
his attentions are now
focused on her mother.

25:30.536 --> 25:32.287
At the time
Hope went missing,

25:32.371 --> 25:34.606
there was another
potential victim,

25:34.657 --> 25:36.402
who was the same age
and had the same physical

25:36.427 --> 25:37.805
characteristics as Hope,

25:37.877 --> 25:40.328
and she was even more
accessible.

25:40.413 --> 25:42.947
Which tells us that Hope
became his idealized target.

25:42.999 --> 25:45.717
Despite the high risk,
he abducted Monica in public,

25:45.784 --> 25:48.053
which shows she's pivotal
to his fantasy.

25:48.120 --> 25:49.387
We believe the unsub
has Monica captive

25:49.455 --> 25:52.390
within a 20-mile radius
of this abduction site.

25:52.458 --> 25:54.726
There's a strong possibility
that until recently

25:54.793 --> 25:56.511
the unsub kept Hope alive.

25:56.596 --> 25:59.681
This explains why he didn't
hunt again for all these years.

25:59.765 --> 26:02.517
And that it was Hope's death that
triggered the change in his M.O.

26:02.585 --> 26:06.688
If the same guy has her,
how long is she really gonna last?

26:08.641 --> 26:10.192
I know her.

26:10.276 --> 26:13.612
I know Monica.
Monica is my friend,

26:13.663 --> 26:16.164
and she is a fighter,
and she is not gonna give up,

26:16.249 --> 26:17.749
so neither should we.

26:28.761 --> 26:30.095
Monica?

26:33.432 --> 26:34.432
Don't go in there!

27:36.707 --> 27:39.626
I didn't want you
to find out like this.

27:41.416 --> 27:42.466
I'm sorry.

27:42.551 --> 27:44.451
I can explain.

27:44.503 --> 27:46.554
[Retching]

27:46.621 --> 27:48.167
Shh.

27:48.168 --> 27:49.886
No! Don't touch me.

27:49.970 --> 27:51.721
I loved her, too.

27:51.805 --> 27:53.089
[Sobbing]

27:53.173 --> 27:56.095
She was my baby?

27:56.096 --> 27:57.613
The moment I saw her,
I knew what a beautiful

27:57.638 --> 27:59.028
woman she'd become.

28:00.481 --> 28:01.764
[Crying]

28:01.849 --> 28:03.716
I loved her, Monica.
I loved her.

28:03.767 --> 28:04.984
No.

28:05.051 --> 28:07.103
No.

28:07.187 --> 28:08.220
No.

28:08.272 --> 28:10.072
You don't know
how I searched.

28:10.157 --> 28:13.225
I was about to give up,
and then--and there she was,

28:13.277 --> 28:17.580
this beautiful cocooned
butterfly ready to emerge.

28:17.664 --> 28:19.565
You kept her chained

28:19.616 --> 28:21.617
like an animal.

28:21.702 --> 28:23.503
No, no, no, you don't
understand what happened.

28:23.570 --> 28:26.122
My child.

28:26.206 --> 28:28.240
Why did you...

28:28.292 --> 28:30.242
[Sobbing]

28:30.294 --> 28:31.894
It wasn't my fault.

28:31.962 --> 28:34.347
You murdered my baby

28:34.431 --> 28:36.248
no, Hope killed herself!

28:36.300 --> 28:40.470
[Sobbing]

28:40.554 --> 28:42.254
So the day of the anniversary

28:42.306 --> 28:44.924
would have been when Monica
was most vulnerable and exposed.

28:44.975 --> 28:46.677
And the unsub knew that
and he came armed with

28:46.702 --> 28:48.210
information about Hope.

28:48.378 --> 28:50.313
So she lets her guard down,
leaves the house,

28:50.397 --> 28:52.064
and goes to
the support group meeting.

28:52.115 --> 28:54.734
Where she can share her feelings
with people who understand her.

28:54.785 --> 28:56.193
But how did he know after
this particular meeting

28:56.218 --> 28:57.418
she'd be emotionally raw?

28:57.905 --> 28:59.872
Well, if he stalked her in the
parking lot after the meeting,

28:59.940 --> 29:02.408
he would have seen the pain
written across her face.

29:02.459 --> 29:05.795
What if he knew because
he'd heard the story before?

29:05.879 --> 29:08.798
What if he's a member
of her support group?

29:10.384 --> 29:12.502
JJ, the things we talk
about in that group

29:12.586 --> 29:14.353
are beyond personal.

29:14.421 --> 29:15.721
We wouldn't have
asked you to do this

29:15.789 --> 29:18.057
if we didn't think is was
gonna help us find Monica.

29:18.124 --> 29:20.059
I know, but to talk about
what happens in there,

29:20.126 --> 29:24.063
it's a violation
of all kinds of--of privacy.

29:24.130 --> 29:26.516
I promise, nothing that
doesn't pertain to this case

29:26.600 --> 29:28.300
will ever
leave this room.

29:37.294 --> 29:39.362
Who's sharing?

29:40.814 --> 29:42.248
Monica.

29:42.315 --> 29:44.750
She's talking about a little girl
that looked like Hope

29:44.818 --> 29:46.419
that she saw.

29:46.486 --> 29:48.254
Ok, now, I want you
to look around the room.

29:48.321 --> 29:50.990
Is anyone reacting to her?

29:54.628 --> 29:57.513
No. They're all
just listening to her.

29:57.598 --> 30:00.182
Ok, now what happened
after Monica finished sharing?

30:04.321 --> 30:08.274
She was trying
not to cry and...

30:08.342 --> 30:09.976
I didn't know
what to say.

30:10.043 --> 30:12.645
Did anyone share after her?

30:12.696 --> 30:14.447
Someone started
to say something,

30:14.514 --> 30:16.616
but then I ended
the meeting because--

30:16.683 --> 30:18.017
Ok, stop right there.

30:18.068 --> 30:21.237
I need to know who spoke.

30:21.321 --> 30:22.788
That's why we're all here.

30:22.856 --> 30:24.624
This guy who lost his wife.

30:24.691 --> 30:27.126
He was sitting behind her
and he rubbed her shoulder.

30:27.193 --> 30:28.911
He was trying
to calm her down.

30:28.996 --> 30:30.863
Ok, so let's move
to the end of the night.

30:30.914 --> 30:32.498
What happened after the meeting?

30:33.667 --> 30:35.701
I followed Monica
out to the hallway,

30:35.752 --> 30:37.420
and she said
she had to go home.

30:37.504 --> 30:38.921
And then what happened?

30:39.006 --> 30:41.390
[No audio]

30:47.213 --> 30:49.932
It's Bill.

30:50.017 --> 30:52.268
Please let me explain.

30:52.336 --> 30:54.487
No, I don't want
to hear anything.

30:54.554 --> 30:58.691
At night, I could always hear Hope
walking around up in her room.

30:58.742 --> 31:00.943
And then...

31:01.011 --> 31:03.446
This one night she was
pacing back and forth.

31:03.530 --> 31:07.533
Then she stopped. So...

31:07.584 --> 31:11.187
I came up to check on her...

31:11.254 --> 31:13.522
But the door was blocked.

31:16.660 --> 31:19.228
And when I tried to open it...

31:22.199 --> 31:24.100
There was blood everywhere.

31:24.167 --> 31:25.568
No...

31:25.636 --> 31:26.602
No!

31:26.670 --> 31:28.604
I tried to stop the bleeding,

31:28.672 --> 31:30.139
but it was too late.

31:30.223 --> 31:32.608
[Gasps]

31:32.693 --> 31:35.094
Wait a minute.

31:35.145 --> 31:36.612
I've heard this.

31:37.931 --> 31:40.783
You spoke in group.

31:40.867 --> 31:44.603
It was...your wife.

31:44.655 --> 31:47.456
But you were talking
about my Hope.

31:47.541 --> 31:49.792
I lost her.

31:49.876 --> 31:51.711
You were my only
connection to her.

31:51.778 --> 31:55.214
[Crying]
I shed tears for you.

31:55.281 --> 31:57.500
I helped you grieve.

32:00.337 --> 32:04.390
So William Rogers joined the
support group 2 months ago.

32:04.457 --> 32:06.008
Garcia's still looking
for an address.

32:06.093 --> 32:07.426
Any priors?

32:07.477 --> 32:09.294
Yeah. An attempted
kidnapping of a 14-year-old.

32:09.346 --> 32:12.064
He lured her to a studio with
promises of becoming a model.

32:12.132 --> 32:13.470
When she got there,
he made sexual advances.

32:13.495 --> 32:14.466
She got away.

32:14.467 --> 32:16.602
You know, rethinking the type
of offender he was 7 years ago,

32:16.653 --> 32:19.605
it's possible the unsub didn't
sexually assault Hope initially

32:19.656 --> 32:21.240
but waited
until she was older.

32:21.307 --> 32:24.243
Well, that would explain why
he held on to her all this time.

32:24.310 --> 32:28.247
In his fantasy, he might envision
Hope at a more desirable age.

32:28.314 --> 32:31.450
What story did he use to
get into the support group?

32:31.501 --> 32:34.120
Well, he told them his
pregnant wife committed suicide.

32:34.171 --> 32:36.789
Apparently they were trying
to conceive for over a year.

32:36.840 --> 32:38.174
Hope couldn't
bear the thought

32:38.258 --> 32:39.625
of bringing his child
into this world,

32:39.676 --> 32:42.178
so she took what little
control she did have

32:42.262 --> 32:43.345
and ended her life.

32:43.430 --> 32:44.797
And that was never
part of his plan.

32:44.848 --> 32:46.132
It turned his world
upside down.

32:46.183 --> 32:48.884
He's not ready to let go of
the bond he had with Hope.

32:48.969 --> 32:50.786
And now he's trying to get back
what was taken from him.

32:50.854 --> 32:53.389
Wouldn't it just be easier
for him to start over again?

32:53.473 --> 32:56.525
Unless Monica could
give him what he lost.

32:56.610 --> 32:58.144
Another Hope.

32:59.529 --> 33:02.648
He didn't take Monica
to remind him of Hope,

33:02.699 --> 33:07.186
he took her to recreate her.

33:12.826 --> 33:14.210
[Door unlocks]

33:22.169 --> 33:24.003
I want to make peace.

33:28.141 --> 33:31.093
You shared with the group

33:31.178 --> 33:33.813
that you were thinking
of having another baby.

33:33.880 --> 33:35.815
What are you--

33:35.882 --> 33:39.935
All those things that
you missed out on with Hope,

33:40.020 --> 33:41.937
we'll get to experience
with this new baby

33:42.022 --> 33:43.856
that we're going to create.

33:46.526 --> 33:48.410
Don't touch me.
Don't you touch me!

33:48.495 --> 33:49.612

33:51.731 --> 33:55.367
This guy like redefined
home invasion.

33:55.418 --> 33:57.203
By going to those
group meetings,

33:57.254 --> 33:59.789
it was like he read
Monica's diary,

33:59.873 --> 34:02.675
like she only talked about her most
personal feelings in that group.

34:02.742 --> 34:05.211
The group--the group
is definitely gonna have to disband.

34:05.262 --> 34:07.296
Focus on finding this address.

34:07.380 --> 34:10.933
I am. I'm focusing and freaking
out at the exact same time.

34:11.016 --> 34:13.085
I got it. I got it.
He has two addresses.

34:13.136 --> 34:16.722
The first one is on Main.
It's listed as a previous,

34:16.773 --> 34:19.641
but it's not been updated
in the system.

34:19.726 --> 34:21.726
And the second one
is on Brooks.

34:21.777 --> 34:25.264
And I have just sent them
to your PDAs.

34:25.315 --> 34:27.817
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where do you think you're going?

34:27.900 --> 34:29.150
I'm going with you.

34:29.235 --> 34:30.735
No, that can't happen.
It could be way too dangerous.

34:30.786 --> 34:33.205
Ok. Um, either
you let me go with you

34:33.273 --> 34:34.552
or you're going to
have to forcibly remove me

34:34.577 --> 34:36.143
from the SUV. Your choice.

34:50.123 --> 34:54.092
I brought you
your favorite tea.

34:54.143 --> 34:59.682
You know, we have to
move forward in our lives.

34:59.766 --> 35:01.934
That's what Hope would want.

35:03.603 --> 35:06.155
For both of us.

35:14.480 --> 35:17.666

has that much time.

this like a hostage situation.

37:57.318 --> 37:59.970
Penelope, I'm not...

38:00.021 --> 38:01.605
much of a phone person.

38:01.656 --> 38:07.411
So if you want to continue
this conversation in private...

38:11.166 --> 38:13.117
The door is open.

38:13.168 --> 38:15.169
Monica: Penelope, don't!

38:15.253 --> 38:16.503
I'm going in there.

38:16.588 --> 38:18.589
Uh--no, no, Garcia.

38:18.656 --> 38:21.542
JJ, I have to.
I have to.

38:24.829 --> 38:27.131
All right.
You just stay close.

38:27.182 --> 38:28.849
Ok.

38:41.012 --> 38:43.063
Morgan: JJ, we're in.

38:43.131 --> 38:44.798
All right, go ahead.

38:51.139 --> 38:52.489
Bill?

38:52.540 --> 38:54.708
Bill?

38:57.162 --> 38:59.046
I don't want to upset you.

39:01.666 --> 39:03.667
[Grunts]
Hey.

39:03.718 --> 39:06.803
Bill, you never meant
to hurt Monica.

39:08.673 --> 39:10.474
Just like you never meant
to hurt Hope.

39:10.541 --> 39:12.809
He murdered my baby.

39:12.877 --> 39:14.761
Shut the door!

39:14.846 --> 39:16.563
Bill...

39:16.648 --> 39:18.398
I--I know

39:18.483 --> 39:20.984
the pain you feel.
I get you.

39:21.052 --> 39:23.887
I know. I heard you
talk about it in group.

39:25.190 --> 39:27.524
Why doesn't Monica
understand that?

39:27.575 --> 39:31.945
Bill, I just think she needs
more time to understand it.

39:32.030 --> 39:34.198
What?

39:34.249 --> 39:35.398
Listen, Bill.

39:35.450 --> 39:37.067
I know all you ever wanted

39:37.118 --> 39:39.836
was just somebody to love.

39:39.904 --> 39:42.256
You were trapped
inside a cocoon

39:42.340 --> 39:46.460
just waiting for somebody
to set you free.

39:46.544 --> 39:49.513
Hope made me feel...

39:49.580 --> 39:51.915
for the first time
in my life, I felt love.

39:51.966 --> 39:55.852
She was my baby!

39:55.920 --> 40:00.140
You brought Monica here
because you're heartbroken.

40:00.225 --> 40:03.063
And you're desperate
to recreate what

40:03.088 --> 40:04.288
you lost with Hope.

40:04.946 --> 40:08.031
I lost my child!

40:08.099 --> 40:10.934
Bill, you need to tell her.

40:10.985 --> 40:12.202
You can do this, ok?

40:12.270 --> 40:15.706
You need to let her know
why this is all happening.

40:15.773 --> 40:17.207
You need to tell her.
You can do this.

40:20.328 --> 40:21.745
Say something.

40:21.796 --> 40:23.964
Say something!

40:24.048 --> 40:27.551
Our baby...

40:27.618 --> 40:31.255
Oh, my God.

40:31.306 --> 40:33.223
[Sobbing] Oh, my God,
my baby.

40:33.291 --> 40:34.457
Hope was pregnant.

40:36.961 --> 40:38.345
Bill, drop the gun.

40:38.429 --> 40:39.396
Do what he says.

40:39.463 --> 40:40.397
Drop it--now.

40:40.464 --> 40:42.266
It's ok, Bill.

40:42.317 --> 40:44.601
Nice and easy,

40:49.490 --> 40:52.192
now put your hands
where I can see them.

40:52.277 --> 40:56.580
Reid: Slowly step away
from Monica.

40:58.449 --> 40:59.616
Morgan: Easy...

40:59.667 --> 41:01.418
Garcia: Monica!

41:01.485 --> 41:03.170
[Gunshot]

41:09.493 --> 41:12.262
Garcia: We are each
on our own journey.

41:12.330 --> 41:16.049
Each of us are on
our very own adventure,

41:16.134 --> 41:17.601
encountering all kinds
of challenges,

41:17.668 --> 41:19.603
and the choices we make
on that adventure

41:19.671 --> 41:21.938
will shape us as we go.

41:22.006 --> 41:24.558
Those choices will
stretch us and test us

41:24.642 --> 41:26.777
and push us to our limit.

41:26.844 --> 41:28.779
And our adventure
will make us stronger

41:28.846 --> 41:31.315
than we ever knew we could be.

41:50.551 --> 41:54.304
There's a quote by my favorite
author, Joseph Campbell,

41:54.372 --> 41:56.807
and it goes like this:

41:56.874 --> 41:59.509
"Find a place inside
where there's joy,

41:59.560 --> 42:02.512
and the joy will
burn out the pain."
