00:07.700 --> 00:09.200
Hi, how are you?

00:16.140 --> 00:17.474
Hi, how are you?

00:18.744 --> 00:21.161
Welcome, welcome to Dog shop.

00:24.122 --> 00:26.362
Hello, how are you?

00:26.512 --> 00:27.195
Welcome.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:45.325 --> 00:46.158
What?

00:47.443 --> 00:49.853
Is still don't understand why ignorance

00:50.003 --> 00:52.621
is being pummeled in the face
by that gnarly little angel.

00:52.771 --> 00:55.544
You think ignorance is good?

00:55.694 --> 00:57.092
I think it's a fact.

00:57.242 --> 00:59.575
I think everyone's ignorant.

01:00.621 --> 01:03.021
This painting's about
triumphing over ignorance,

01:03.171 --> 01:05.015
it's about being better than that.

01:05.165 --> 01:06.963
The angel is just trying to wake her up.

01:07.113 --> 01:08.471
The wake up call.

01:08.621 --> 01:10.362
Unfortunately, it's
probably gonna take like,

01:10.512 --> 01:12.283
a million fucking years but, you know,

01:12.433 --> 01:13.313
some people need that.

01:13.463 --> 01:14.861
I disagree with you,
I'm gonna stop shitting

01:15.011 --> 01:16.834
on our childhood memory because...

01:16.984 --> 01:18.003
No but what do
you think you should do?

01:18.153 --> 01:19.005
I don't think this is productive,

01:19.155 --> 01:19.973
I don't wanna talk about it.

01:20.123 --> 01:20.994
What do you think
ignorance should do?

01:21.144 --> 01:25.485
You think she should stay
crying and miserable?

01:25.635 --> 01:26.674
Ignorance should just get out

01:26.824 --> 01:27.714
of this painting I guess 'cause...

01:27.864 --> 01:29.847
Get out of this painting,
yeah that's helpful.

01:29.997 --> 01:31.981
If she got a fucking
trumpet and grew some wings,

01:32.131 --> 01:34.711
she could fucking go up there.

01:34.861 --> 01:36.215
I'm gonna go look over the abstract art,

01:36.365 --> 01:38.682
because we never visit
that side of the museum,

01:38.832 --> 01:41.045
I'll meet you in 10 okay?

01:41.195 --> 01:43.409
You won't feel anything.

02:30.221 --> 02:31.054
Jasmine.

02:54.963 --> 02:57.296
The store looks like shit.

03:41.404 --> 03:43.255
I just need a change.

03:43.405 --> 03:45.101
A makeover's a good place to start,

03:45.251 --> 03:47.283
have you thought about blonde?

03:47.433 --> 03:48.803
Blonde?

03:48.953 --> 03:49.979
Virgin?

03:50.129 --> 03:51.156
My hair?

03:52.205 --> 03:54.098
Yeah, my hair is virgin.

03:54.248 --> 03:55.991
Okay, I can see it now.

03:56.141 --> 03:58.824
Today you and I are going all the way

03:58.974 --> 04:01.658
it's gonna be very exciting, platinum.

04:56.083 --> 04:59.833
Oh hey, excuse me
miss, I, are you a model?

05:01.402 --> 05:04.824
Well you should be, because
you have a great look.

05:14.285 --> 05:15.133
Scouted?

05:15.283 --> 05:17.261
Yeah I was
scouted, by a modeling agent.

05:17.411 --> 05:18.178
For what?

05:20.781 --> 05:22.364
Modeling.

05:24.621 --> 05:28.781
That's so ridiculous, I hope
you know what you're doing.

05:28.931 --> 05:32.031
I just don't want you to get exploited.

05:33.005 --> 05:34.455
Especially if you don't look very good.

05:34.605 --> 05:38.772
Well you look like someone
who could be exploited.

05:42.225 --> 05:43.558
Keeping it real.

05:44.584 --> 05:45.568
Why?

05:45.718 --> 05:46.553
What?

05:46.703 --> 05:48.128
Why do I look like someone

05:48.278 --> 05:49.554
who could get exploited?

05:49.704 --> 05:52.845
'cause you went out and
got yourself a silly haircut.

05:52.995 --> 05:53.698
Seriously?

05:53.848 --> 05:54.845
And you think that just
because someone gives you

05:54.995 --> 05:57.116
their business card, you know,

05:57.266 --> 06:00.599
you're the next Tyra Banks or something.

06:02.248 --> 06:04.915
At least I'll make more money.

07:57.325 --> 07:58.242
New hair?

07:59.346 --> 08:00.853
Yeah, do you like it?

08:01.003 --> 08:02.511
I liked it better brown.

08:04.945 --> 08:06.778
Blonde washes you out.

08:11.304 --> 08:12.574
Hot date?

08:12.724 --> 08:13.994
Wish me luck.

08:15.944 --> 08:16.944
Good luck.

08:26.728 --> 08:28.205
Hmm, hi there.

08:28.355 --> 08:29.058
Hi.

08:29.208 --> 08:30.541
Hi, I'm Jared.

08:31.725 --> 08:32.855
I'm Irene.

08:33.005 --> 08:35.474
You caught me right
in the middle of lunch,

08:35.624 --> 08:40.365
mid danish here, so officially
I'm not even here right now.

08:40.515 --> 08:41.198
Okay?

08:42.125 --> 08:44.627
But you're here, so we can do this.

08:44.777 --> 08:46.703
How tall are you?

08:46.853 --> 08:47.955
5'11.

08:48.105 --> 08:49.219
Really?

08:49.369 --> 08:50.333
Yeah.

08:50.483 --> 08:52.488
Okay, what are your measurements?

08:52.638 --> 08:53.571
34, 24, 34.

08:56.008 --> 08:59.570
Hmm, Eyeballing you, I'd
probably add a few numbers

08:59.720 --> 09:03.283
to every number you just
said to me, but that okay.

09:03.433 --> 09:05.490
Hmm, how old are you?

09:05.640 --> 09:07.698
I'm 23, I just turned 23.

09:08.584 --> 09:11.490
Hmm, honey, no, if
we're gonna work together,

09:11.640 --> 09:14.057
we're gonna need to
start from a foundation

09:14.207 --> 09:16.625
of honesty, I'm having
a hard time believing

09:16.775 --> 09:18.428
you're 23 years old.

09:18.578 --> 09:20.231
I'm really 23 years old.

09:22.568 --> 09:24.143
Okay, I'm gonna choose to believe you,

09:24.293 --> 09:24.976
may I?

09:27.345 --> 09:28.316
The hair.

09:28.466 --> 09:29.633
Oh, so coarse.

09:30.824 --> 09:31.853
It's like horse hair.

09:32.003 --> 09:35.082
Like a little pony, little philly.

09:35.232 --> 09:36.445
That's a joke you can laugh.

09:37.981 --> 09:38.814
Okay.

09:39.843 --> 09:42.728
Hum, alright why don't
you grab your stuff,

09:42.878 --> 09:45.613
come back to my office,
we'll talk this over.

09:45.763 --> 09:47.363
The New Faces division is
where we prepare all our girls

09:47.513 --> 09:49.415
to become successful models,

09:49.565 --> 09:52.840
and we take 20% for all
print and runway work.

09:52.990 --> 09:54.131
A girl can't test enough,

09:54.281 --> 09:56.296
so I'm gonna expect you to test regularly.

09:56.446 --> 09:58.461
And you'll be responsible
for covering that,

09:58.611 --> 10:01.133
runs 350 to 550 per test.

10:01.283 --> 10:03.806
And what I actually get paid,

10:05.085 --> 10:06.668
how does that work?

10:08.483 --> 10:11.523
You'll be paid within
90 days of working.

10:11.673 --> 10:12.754
Per job?

10:12.904 --> 10:15.944
Hey, look, the first year is all about

10:16.094 --> 10:17.400
building a strong portfolio,

10:17.550 --> 10:18.856
if you make money, fantastic,

10:19.006 --> 10:20.455
but don't expect it.

10:20.605 --> 10:24.522
Oh by the way, do you wanna work for us?

10:25.863 --> 10:27.863
That was a joke as well.

10:29.704 --> 10:30.631
It's important to look your age,

10:30.781 --> 10:34.984
all this heavy makeup,
makes you look so old,

10:35.134 --> 10:37.162
we're gonna need to monitor what goes

10:37.312 --> 10:38.791
into your body, alright?

10:38.941 --> 10:42.217
That means lots of water,
seven to eight hours of sleep

10:42.367 --> 10:45.643
every night, limit your sugar
and salt intake, exercise.

10:45.793 --> 10:47.901
I will take care of all of that.

10:48.051 --> 10:50.002
Good, aren't you excited?

10:50.152 --> 10:51.399
You look scared!

10:51.549 --> 10:52.797
I am, excited.

10:55.882 --> 10:57.603
You know, it's a good thing
we signed you in right there,

10:57.753 --> 10:59.843
another year and we couldn't have,

10:59.993 --> 11:02.083
I mean, you would've aged out.

11:04.521 --> 11:05.896
Hi mom.

11:06.046 --> 11:07.271
Hi, oh!

11:07.421 --> 11:08.685
Oh my god it's the same
color as mine almost.

11:08.835 --> 11:11.154
Makes you look kinda wise.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.994
What the hell are you celebrating?

11:14.144 --> 11:16.834
I signed with a modeling agency today.

11:19.005 --> 11:20.119
Really?

11:20.269 --> 11:21.234
Yeah.

11:21.384 --> 11:23.252
Well that's exciting.

11:23.402 --> 11:25.191
So you're not at the shop?

11:25.341 --> 11:27.421
No, I'm not working at the shop,

11:27.571 --> 11:28.775
well I'm working part time,

11:28.925 --> 11:30.513
I can only work on weekends now,

11:30.663 --> 11:32.967
but I called Rachel
and she's fine with it.

11:33.117 --> 11:35.094
That's not good
though, that's freelance,

11:35.244 --> 11:37.222
you're not gonna make enough money to pay

11:37.372 --> 11:39.639
your college loans, pay rent.

11:41.341 --> 11:42.610
Um, well I have savings.

11:42.760 --> 11:44.687
Dad, I mean modeling is an investment,

11:44.837 --> 11:46.614
it's like opening your own business.

11:46.764 --> 11:48.391
DOn't get down on a stiff, and I mean,

11:48.541 --> 11:51.082
it's risky sure, but I
think it's a good idea

11:51.232 --> 11:52.493
you try something new.

11:52.643 --> 11:54.781
Anyway, she's old enough
to make her own decisions.

11:54.931 --> 11:55.948
It's her life.

11:57.981 --> 11:59.892
But it's our champagne.

12:00.042 --> 12:01.928
And I think she shouldn't open the bottle

12:02.078 --> 12:03.965
until we have something
really to celebrate.

12:04.115 --> 12:04.813
Oh, that's true.

12:04.963 --> 12:06.883
When we do it's our anniversary
champagne, put it back.

12:07.033 --> 12:07.716
Sorry.

12:10.282 --> 12:11.722
Are you gonna stay for lunch?

12:11.872 --> 12:13.575
Um no, I don't think so,

12:13.725 --> 12:16.803
I just popped in to
tell you the good news.

12:16.953 --> 12:17.991
That was your news?

12:18.141 --> 12:20.308
That was the news, yeah.

12:23.683 --> 12:24.701
Are you available
tomorrow for a last minute

12:24.851 --> 12:26.572
catalog shoot downtown?

12:26.722 --> 12:28.786
Okay good it'll be a free test,

12:28.936 --> 12:30.850
call time's gonna be 8:30 a. m.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.944
And Angel is gonna want easy casual poses

12:34.094 --> 12:36.071
think Bloomingdale meets Shopbop,

12:36.221 --> 12:38.941
cataloguish but not too generic,
keep it still, you know,

12:39.091 --> 12:41.501
fresh and flirty, bring
a nude bra with straps,

12:41.651 --> 12:43.570
a straddle snoot bra, new underwear,

12:43.720 --> 12:45.464
basically everything
new, ripped denim shorts,

12:45.614 --> 12:47.373
white shorts, any other color shorts.

12:47.523 --> 12:49.282
And white skinny jeans and a denim skirt.

12:49.432 --> 12:51.970
Something fresh light easy fun,

12:52.120 --> 12:54.104
you wanna look sexy but
you don't wanna look

12:54.254 --> 12:55.394
like a whore.

12:55.544 --> 12:56.525
You know, just look through your stuff,

12:56.675 --> 12:58.141
see what you got, okay, just
make sure it's laundered

12:58.291 --> 13:00.012
please, 'cause some of these girls,

13:00.162 --> 13:01.843
I get horror stories that
come back from the client

13:01.993 --> 13:03.426
we don't want that.

13:10.058 --> 13:11.995
Hey your boyfriend is juicing right?

13:12.145 --> 13:14.083
Yeah he is, but he's doing solids too.

13:14.233 --> 13:16.455
What kind of juicer is he using?

13:16.605 --> 13:20.360
It's something like
the omega blaster 3000...

13:20.510 --> 13:21.277
Ah, yeah.

13:22.621 --> 13:24.376
Yeah, it's got this
like huge hover thing

13:24.526 --> 13:26.282
and I'm just using it to make cashew milk.

13:26.432 --> 13:28.212
Okay, yeah, the Omega is amazing

13:28.362 --> 13:32.529
but I feel so guilty throwing
away all that pulp, you know.

13:34.264 --> 13:36.885
Listen, I'll tell you
a secret, you can get

13:37.035 --> 13:39.823
a dehydrator, you can
compact all that pulp

13:39.973 --> 13:42.762
and make these lovely
crispy yummy crackers.

13:42.912 --> 13:43.610
Oh my gosh.

13:43.760 --> 13:45.393
I'm ready to work, you're ready?

13:45.543 --> 13:46.925
Yeah, I'm
not leaving till we get

13:47.075 --> 13:47.815
a great shot.

13:47.965 --> 13:50.758
Wonderful, well we are
not reinventing the wheel

13:50.908 --> 13:53.702
here so hopefully we're
all done by three, okay?

13:53.852 --> 13:55.869
Alright let's get started.

13:57.704 --> 14:01.338
Don't move to much, let
me give you the directions

14:01.488 --> 14:04.973
okay a little bit to your
left, your other left,

14:05.123 --> 14:09.405
okay great, hmm, too much,
not that much profile okay,

14:09.555 --> 14:12.682
chin down, in a little
bit gimme your eyes,

14:12.832 --> 14:15.144
very good, there, now we're talking.

14:15.294 --> 14:16.391
Okay, great moving on.

14:16.541 --> 14:20.620
We're gonna change up the
jacket and we're gonna put

14:20.770 --> 14:21.787
this shirt on.

14:27.421 --> 14:29.394
Nice okay, do the profiles.

14:29.544 --> 14:33.245
Turn your head a little bit towards me

14:33.395 --> 14:35.314
when you do that, there you go,

14:35.464 --> 14:38.547
night three quarter shot, okay, turn.

14:39.901 --> 14:41.191
Susan how are you?

14:41.341 --> 14:44.536
I'm good, I'm doing
well, I'm really busy but,

14:44.686 --> 14:47.731
you know that's great
so yeah, how about you?

14:47.881 --> 14:50.736
Yeah it's really crazy, I
just came back from Arizona

14:50.886 --> 14:53.741
and I had no idea how it
looks like New York and LA

14:53.891 --> 14:56.391
have sucked up all of the creative people

14:56.541 --> 14:59.242
out of the country, it's
like all the creatives,

14:59.392 --> 15:01.991
all the artists all the pretty people,

15:02.141 --> 15:04.780
they've all moved from
other parts of the country

15:04.930 --> 15:07.325
to LA and New York,
and nobody else exists.

15:07.475 --> 15:08.935
That's true like totally.

15:09.085 --> 15:11.495
Like my
family's back in the Midwest,

15:11.645 --> 15:14.723
and they just think I'm
crazy going out in LA

15:14.873 --> 15:17.031
doing makeup, but I mean, they're all

15:17.181 --> 15:19.815
in the medical industry,
you know, doctors,

15:19.965 --> 15:23.498
scientists, so, yeah it's a
whole other world out here.

15:23.648 --> 15:25.011
Do you do a lot of beauty?

15:25.161 --> 15:27.965
I'd really wanna do a beauty
shoot for my portfolio.

15:28.115 --> 15:30.033
Uh, I could be down with that.

15:30.183 --> 15:32.372
Okay, okay yeah, I just,

15:32.522 --> 15:35.421
I really need a model
with a good strong face.

15:35.571 --> 15:37.341
Ed Haunts.

15:39.782 --> 15:40.779
Totally.

15:47.485 --> 15:48.701
I had my first shoot yesterday.

15:48.851 --> 15:49.534
Really?

15:50.525 --> 15:51.373
How'd it go?

15:51.523 --> 15:53.797
They didn't really
care about the picture

15:53.947 --> 15:56.221
they talked about themselves, that's it.

15:56.371 --> 15:58.993
Yeah, big fucking surprise,

15:59.143 --> 16:00.754
they don't care about being creative,

16:00.904 --> 16:05.071
so I don't get why you're
getting involved with them.

16:07.421 --> 16:09.181
I have reasons.

16:09.331 --> 16:10.612
Like what?

16:10.762 --> 16:12.173
You're not getting paid,
you're not gonna get

16:12.323 --> 16:14.883
any respect like ever, and
you'll never be young enough,

16:15.033 --> 16:16.633
so you, you're bored.

16:20.003 --> 16:21.773
No, I like image making.

16:21.923 --> 16:23.581
You didn't get cool
images, you look like shit.

16:23.731 --> 16:25.998
Why are you modeling, really?

16:26.883 --> 16:28.517
It's complicated.

16:28.667 --> 16:30.151
I'm sure it is, yeah.

16:30.301 --> 16:33.301
Oh Arthur, I've been an
ugly duckling my whole life

16:33.451 --> 16:36.452
just let me be a swan this
one time, please, please.

16:38.563 --> 16:40.692
My next job will be better.

16:40.842 --> 16:45.009
In a year I'll be unsignable
so I'll just do this now.

16:47.405 --> 16:49.655
Why are you running away?

16:59.507 --> 17:02.227
Yeah, drown for all I care.

17:02.377 --> 17:03.810
You're so annoying.

17:06.387 --> 17:07.220
Oh my God.

17:09.906 --> 17:11.490
I get it, I get it.

17:14.029 --> 17:15.779
You can come out now.

17:23.507 --> 17:26.339
Doors are closing.

17:27.405 --> 17:28.467
You know, what do you wanna say fuck you

17:28.617 --> 17:30.634
when you got nothing left.

17:33.645 --> 17:36.627
Nobody wants to fuck me now.

17:36.777 --> 17:38.127
I'm a Vietnam Vet.

17:43.469 --> 17:44.738
Probably did more than five years

17:44.888 --> 17:47.837
and the rest you
motherfuckers all day long.

17:47.987 --> 17:52.947
Nobody wants to fuck you
when you got nothing left.

17:53.097 --> 17:55.530
Why can't people come together?

18:00.307 --> 18:03.837
Get rid of the grub, get rid of it.

18:03.987 --> 18:06.442
Now I don't wanna tell
you how to live your life,

18:06.592 --> 18:09.048
who am I to tell anybody
how to live their life.

18:09.198 --> 18:11.465
I'm just telling what I know.

18:20.248 --> 18:23.165
My son, said he's been with a boy.

18:25.389 --> 18:26.775
When I ask him why he go ahead, he said

18:26.925 --> 18:31.008
I just wanted to see what
it was like with a boy.

18:31.865 --> 18:34.615
When my wife and I were together,

18:36.429 --> 18:38.762
we made babies all day long.

18:44.387 --> 18:47.137
I just, it cost less to keep her.

18:50.685 --> 18:52.102
Less to keep her.

19:02.787 --> 19:03.620
My stop.

19:24.349 --> 19:27.719
It's 3 a. m. is something wrong?

19:27.869 --> 19:31.394
Nothing is wrong Irene,
what I need you to do, okay,

19:31.544 --> 19:34.919
is open your email and
there's a Word doc in there,

19:35.069 --> 19:38.186
so open the Word doc, okay,
you know how to do that, right?

19:38.336 --> 19:40.906
Read what I sent you
and just, there might be

19:41.056 --> 19:42.416
one or two typos okay, that's all,

19:42.566 --> 19:46.029
you know it's like, the
devil's in the details,

19:46.179 --> 19:47.411
please, save me the groundwork,

19:47.561 --> 19:50.205
and send it back to me it'll be perfect.

19:50.355 --> 19:51.038
Can you,

19:53.027 --> 19:54.738
can you give me a day or two?

19:54.888 --> 19:58.138
No, open your eyes, open your emails.

20:00.387 --> 20:02.503
Okay, I'll do it right now.

20:02.653 --> 20:04.769
Come on, yes, come on please.

20:09.843 --> 20:13.757
He is stead fast,
resolute, and utterly silent

20:13.907 --> 20:18.074
he feels the cannon stead
fastly, resolutely, silently,

20:19.743 --> 20:22.877
as water he is accustomed
to pounding against

20:23.027 --> 20:25.843
ocean side cliffs making
them crumble to the ground.

20:25.993 --> 20:28.510
All the while he is indifferent.

21:16.173 --> 21:17.442
I booked you for a free
test today at 10 a. m.

21:17.592 --> 21:21.209
Foundation applied, mascara,
eyelashes if you have 'em,

21:21.359 --> 21:25.069
nude manicure, buffed
pedicure, bikini ready,

21:25.219 --> 21:27.731
nude strapless bra, nude regular bra,

21:27.881 --> 21:29.399
and simple black pumps.

21:29.549 --> 21:33.132
Why don't you just
start by bending over?

21:34.029 --> 21:37.112
Yeah, yeah, turn around and ben over.

21:38.011 --> 21:41.331
It's not as naughty as I thought,

21:41.481 --> 21:42.748
turn back around?

21:44.312 --> 21:45.229
Okay, okay.

21:46.849 --> 21:49.266
Okay, do something different,

21:54.771 --> 21:56.438
something different.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.569
That's better, that's better.

22:05.365 --> 22:07.629
That's creative, very nice,

22:07.779 --> 22:09.296
very creative, good.

22:10.611 --> 22:13.912
If you're okay I'll just
shoot this just for fun.

22:14.062 --> 22:16.162
Open you mouth really wide,

22:17.693 --> 22:19.276
now shut your eyes.

22:21.368 --> 22:23.285
Shut your fucking eyes.

22:24.851 --> 22:26.434
Now hang your head.

22:27.511 --> 22:30.519
Perfect, you know what I mean,

22:30.669 --> 22:34.644
modeling it's about taking
something in your life,

22:34.794 --> 22:35.934
something from your life.

22:36.084 --> 22:38.923
You understand what I'm
saying when I say life?

22:39.073 --> 22:41.762
Okay, you understand,
and then, you bring it

22:41.912 --> 22:45.133
into your work, do you know
what I mean when I say work?

22:45.283 --> 22:47.202
Yes okay so be in your life,

22:47.352 --> 22:49.121

22:49.271 --> 22:52.952

22:58.563 --> 23:00.482

23:00.632 --> 23:02.636
This is not a game okay, if you do it,

23:02.786 --> 23:05.343
I'm gonna fuck you, you understand?

23:05.493 --> 23:08.051
That's how real I want it to be.

23:08.201 --> 23:09.801
Okay, good, let's go.

23:15.053 --> 23:15.886
Let's go.

23:22.872 --> 23:24.861
What are you doing?

23:25.011 --> 23:27.350
Alright let's just have
a little chat alright?

23:27.500 --> 23:29.120
Just you and me, alright,

23:29.270 --> 23:30.684
no more photographer model, okay?

23:30.834 --> 23:32.857
Just person to person, alright.

23:33.007 --> 23:35.031
You've fucked before, right?

23:35.181 --> 23:35.878
Right?

23:36.028 --> 23:38.039
So you know how to do that,

23:38.189 --> 23:40.295
I know you do, I see it in your eyes,

23:40.445 --> 23:42.402
I know you made a man wanna do that.

23:42.552 --> 23:46.871
Alright okay, that's yes,
now bring that into work,

23:47.021 --> 23:49.661
yeah and I'm gonna take a picture of it

23:49.811 --> 23:52.691
if you can manifest it, I'm
gonna record it on the photo

23:52.841 --> 23:56.112
sensor, bring it in,
bring it into work now,

23:56.262 --> 23:59.262
bring it into work zone,
work, work, work, work,

23:59.412 --> 24:02.413
come on let's manifest
it, ah, you almost had it,

24:02.563 --> 24:04.322
I almost took a picture.

24:04.472 --> 24:05.362
Alright, I didn't wanna do this,

24:05.512 --> 24:07.891
let's just try something a
little more conventional,

24:08.041 --> 24:11.731
just be an innocent but dirty little girl.

24:11.881 --> 24:13.314
Innocent but dirty.

24:18.413 --> 24:21.039
They're not using
those, they're too artsy,

24:21.189 --> 24:23.816
it was a nine hour shoot,
three hour roundtrip,

24:23.966 --> 24:25.316
free work no food.

24:26.315 --> 24:27.565
You can quit.

24:29.533 --> 24:32.616
I'm not gonna quit, I just started.

24:33.853 --> 24:35.112
I don't know hun, I don't
know what to tell you,

24:35.262 --> 24:36.743
I don't know what they're looking for,

24:36.893 --> 24:38.290
but if you're getting stressed out,

24:38.440 --> 24:39.687
I think you should exercise more.

24:39.837 --> 24:44.733
You could try yoga that'd
be really good for you.

25:11.336 --> 25:14.087
Do you have a valentine?

25:14.237 --> 25:17.124
You need to start thinking about someone

25:17.274 --> 25:20.162
other than yourself, do you have love?

25:23.108 --> 25:25.858
Love is the most important thing.

25:41.508 --> 25:42.823
Irene, this is my
fucking novel, right, yeah

25:42.973 --> 25:45.315
so I didn't ask you to rewrite
the whole fucking thing

25:45.465 --> 25:47.357
okay, you cut everything
that makes it wonderful

25:47.507 --> 25:48.845
the sensuality the light the atmosphere,

25:48.995 --> 25:51.453
they're fucking gone so
please don't give me that kind

25:51.603 --> 25:53.033
of revision again,
alright, I know you want

25:53.183 --> 25:54.957
good things to happen for me, so, just,

25:55.107 --> 25:57.374
don't be retarded, thank you.

26:17.597 --> 26:19.590
Oh hello, today we're
having a trunk show,

26:19.740 --> 26:21.734
it's for the house of
Damiana, so if you have

26:21.884 --> 26:23.282
any questions let me know.

26:23.432 --> 26:26.369
I'm supposed to be here
to model the handbags,

26:26.519 --> 26:29.456
do you have any idea what
kind of girl they like?

26:30.314 --> 26:31.147
Pretty.

26:38.397 --> 26:39.773
This piece as well
and I think it's gonna

26:39.923 --> 26:41.684
look great together.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.114
Okay, why not, let's try this one too.

26:43.264 --> 26:45.437
Yeah, let's try this one yeah.

26:45.587 --> 26:46.270
And,

26:59.755 --> 27:02.005
yeah, I'm sorry, excuse me.

27:15.146 --> 27:18.479
Okay perfect, so the total is gonna be...

27:22.359 --> 27:23.722
The manager will tell you how

27:23.872 --> 27:25.085
she wants you to hold the bag,

27:25.235 --> 27:27.922
so listen to her carefully,
follow her directions,

27:28.072 --> 27:30.760
don't ask too many questions,
don't talk too much.

27:30.910 --> 27:33.626
Don't get in the way of the product.

27:33.776 --> 27:36.877
Mean this stunt is pretty
self explanatory Irene,

27:37.027 --> 27:38.706
you're a live model.

27:38.856 --> 27:41.706
People wanna see what's available.

27:41.856 --> 27:44.561
Make people wanna buy things.

27:44.711 --> 27:47.417
Who's your target demographic?

27:48.440 --> 27:51.437
Well the older ladies, let
those old ladies see those bags

27:51.587 --> 27:54.528
hold the bag in such a way
that it's really showcased

27:54.678 --> 27:57.619
it's really featured, don't
slouch, don't be lazy,

27:57.769 --> 28:00.557
don't just throw the
bag over your shoulder.

28:00.707 --> 28:02.327
Twirl, strut, pose.

28:02.477 --> 28:04.191
And I don't care if your feet bleed,

28:04.341 --> 28:06.056
I want you to take laps around that mall

28:06.206 --> 28:07.976
'till you've sold some bags.

28:08.126 --> 28:09.768
You might need to elbow your way

28:09.918 --> 28:12.617
through all those crowds of people,

28:12.767 --> 28:14.968
do what you gotta do, show off the bag.

28:15.118 --> 28:17.320
This line of work can be very lucrative,

28:17.470 --> 28:19.117
if you do well, I can book you

28:19.267 --> 28:20.827
more work like this,

28:20.977 --> 28:23.149
and you can start making,
you know, real money.

28:23.299 --> 28:24.704
You're a pretty girl.

28:24.854 --> 28:26.315
Let that work for you.

28:26.465 --> 28:27.926
Don't talk too much.

28:49.236 --> 28:50.386
What the fuck were you thinking?

28:50.536 --> 28:51.917
You carried the bag on your shoulder?

28:52.067 --> 28:53.837
How many hours did you work?

28:53.987 --> 28:54.690
Three.

28:54.840 --> 28:56.596
Did she ask you to stay longer?

28:56.746 --> 28:57.586
No.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.880
Did she ask you to come again next week?

29:00.030 --> 29:01.106
She did not.

29:01.256 --> 29:02.907
Were you even friendly and personable?

29:03.057 --> 29:07.080
Did you ask for information
on the merchandise?

29:07.230 --> 29:09.258
No of course you didn't.

29:09.408 --> 29:11.347
Do you need to be spoonfed?

29:11.497 --> 29:13.437
Does baby need her baba?

29:19.466 --> 29:22.589
I'm paid to follow directions,

29:22.739 --> 29:25.357
well that was the problem,
they wouldn't give me any

29:25.507 --> 29:27.774
and I didn't know what to do.

29:29.226 --> 29:30.059
Yeah,

29:31.917 --> 29:34.500
hmm, I get paid within 90 days.

29:36.200 --> 29:38.943
Yeah, I'm budgeting,
dad, I don't have a car,

29:39.093 --> 29:41.837
I don't have insurance,
I don't spend any money.

29:41.987 --> 29:42.670
I cannot,

29:45.480 --> 29:46.313
dad?

29:47.496 --> 29:48.413
Hello, dad?

29:50.536 --> 29:53.088
So your boyfriend was and actual pimp.

29:53.238 --> 29:57.113
I told you that, this
one night that I know of.

29:57.263 --> 30:01.139
Is it like the rap songs
say or is it prettier?

30:10.578 --> 30:13.357
Excuse me, excuse me, do
you have any clothes here

30:13.507 --> 30:15.287
that aren't a size zero?

30:15.437 --> 30:17.854
Are you even listening to me?

30:25.320 --> 30:26.903
No, her dog peed.

30:31.240 --> 30:32.871
What's so fucking funny?

30:33.021 --> 30:34.652
You're gonna clean it.

30:36.499 --> 30:38.579
How's it going over there Irene?

30:38.729 --> 30:39.412
Fine.

30:41.997 --> 30:43.447
Smells bad.

30:43.597 --> 30:46.014
Katy still smells the piss.

30:52.699 --> 30:55.164
Irene, you will be shooting a video

30:55.314 --> 30:57.779
for an art academy tomorrow morning.

30:57.929 --> 30:58.690
Okay?

30:58.840 --> 31:01.400
So be clean and have well
groomed hands and nails.

31:01.550 --> 31:03.920
Be on time, fill out a voucher.

31:04.070 --> 31:06.558
You've been a lot of trouble Irene,

31:06.708 --> 31:09.197
so please, don't be a bigger headache

31:09.347 --> 31:10.614
than you've been.

31:37.117 --> 31:39.267
So this is gonna get
really really hot right?

31:39.417 --> 31:41.939
Yeah, hot dripping wax,
it'll, it'll, it should be fine.

31:42.089 --> 31:44.290
Omar, can you ask the model

31:44.440 --> 31:46.695
if she's ever been burned before?

31:46.845 --> 31:49.101
No I think Irene's fine with burns.

31:49.251 --> 31:50.701
You think she's fine?

31:50.851 --> 31:51.649
Yeah.

31:51.799 --> 31:52.647
You think she's fine,

31:52.797 --> 31:53.789
cause you know we have no liability,

31:53.939 --> 31:56.885
we have 40 minutes left to do this scene.

31:57.035 --> 31:59.981
No, Irene knew what
she was getting into.

32:00.131 --> 32:00.930
When the wax starts melting,

32:01.080 --> 32:02.076
I don't want her to move, not at all,

32:02.226 --> 32:02.930
not a muscle, okay?

32:03.080 --> 32:03.927
Will you tell the model that?

32:04.077 --> 32:05.560
And tell Ria that, or the girl, you know.

32:05.710 --> 32:06.469
Yeah okay.

32:06.619 --> 32:09.202
Irene so you're not gonna move,

32:10.039 --> 32:12.290
once the wax starts melting okay,

32:12.440 --> 32:15.277
I know it's gonna burn, but just don't.

32:15.427 --> 32:17.357
Are we ready Trevor?

32:17.507 --> 32:18.690
Tic toc, Omar?

32:18.840 --> 32:21.181
Off the set please.

32:21.331 --> 32:22.348
Melt please.

32:24.600 --> 32:27.859
Omar, Omar, will you
tell, can you tell her

32:28.009 --> 32:30.148
to bring that thing in closer?

32:30.298 --> 32:31.737
Bring that thing in closer
so it's gonna melt it.

32:31.887 --> 32:33.798
Bring it right up to her skin.

32:33.948 --> 32:35.859
I need to see it melt Omar,

32:36.009 --> 32:37.847
I need to see it melt,

32:37.997 --> 32:41.497

33:36.819 --> 33:38.424
Don't you want them?

33:38.574 --> 33:40.179

33:40.329 --> 33:41.012

33:46.999 --> 33:48.781
Do you like the flowers?

33:48.931 --> 33:50.531

33:52.120 --> 33:55.953
They smell really good

34:00.957 --> 34:03.040
That's a really big vase.

34:04.957 --> 34:07.597

move the arrow tonight

34:07.747 --> 34:09.859
and catch that short film festival,

34:10.009 --> 34:10.710

34:10.860 --> 34:11.859

38:55.915 --> 38:58.221
a brand new pair of shoes, they're heavy

38:58.371 --> 39:02.538

these shoes are called pain,

39:03.651 --> 39:04.734
lace them up.

39:06.435 --> 39:08.072
Every horrible thing
that you've been through,

39:08.222 --> 39:10.989
heartbreak, deceit, cheating, lies,

39:12.995 --> 39:14.766
people that call themselves your friends.

We all have this,

39:18.152 --> 39:19.402
we all have BS.

39:21.571 --> 39:23.488
Honor it, sink into it.

39:24.515 --> 39:27.348
Without that pain, you're nothing.

39:33.452 --> 39:35.533
Oh my god killer workout uh?

39:35.683 --> 39:36.402

his philosophy about pain?

39:43.102 --> 39:45.635

39:58.710 --> 39:59.852

40:00.002 --> 40:00.910
Isn't that crazy?

40:01.060 --> 40:01.969
What's your name?

40:02.119 --> 40:02.823
Irene.

40:02.973 --> 40:03.898
Hi, I'm Spring.

40:04.048 --> 40:04.823
Nice to meet you.

40:04.973 --> 40:05.971
It's so nice to meet you.

40:06.121 --> 40:07.008
Oh.

40:07.158 --> 40:08.046
Oops.

40:09.551 --> 40:11.021
Sorry

40:11.171 --> 40:13.290
Really good job that was today.

40:13.440 --> 40:14.445
Thank you so much,

40:14.595 --> 40:18.079

40:23.213 --> 40:24.280

40:24.430 --> 40:26.162
God I would love some bread right now.

40:26.312 --> 40:29.895
Hmm, what's your number,
we should hangout.

40:31.992 --> 40:33.063
Hello?

40:33.213 --> 40:35.053
Hey you, you, hey!

40:35.203 --> 40:36.503
Hi, hum hi,

40:36.653 --> 40:38.498
do you have these in an extra small?

40:38.648 --> 40:40.919
'cause this small is
like running way too big.

40:41.069 --> 40:43.831
Okay, I'd suggest actually
sticking with that size,

40:43.981 --> 40:45.811
it's gonna shrink up in the wash.

40:45.961 --> 40:47.430
What did you just say to me?

40:47.580 --> 40:49.389
Did you just call me fat?

40:49.539 --> 40:50.880
Can I see a manager please?

40:51.030 --> 40:52.315
Can I see a real person?

40:52.465 --> 40:53.601
I'm a real person.

40:53.751 --> 40:56.051
I'm not talking to you bitch.

40:56.201 --> 40:57.079
Hi.

40:57.229 --> 40:58.809
Hi, I need an extra small.

40:58.959 --> 41:00.136
Extra small.

41:00.286 --> 41:02.103
Oh, thank got, thank God,

41:02.253 --> 41:03.450
Jesus, you should really
watch who you have

41:03.600 --> 41:04.470
working here.

41:04.620 --> 41:05.341
I know, so cute.

41:05.491 --> 41:07.096
I know right, I love them.

41:07.246 --> 41:08.474
Absolutely, love them.

41:08.624 --> 41:09.853
Fix your head bitch.

41:10.003 --> 41:11.103
Come with me.

41:20.631 --> 41:23.831
You've been here seven years right?

41:23.981 --> 41:24.664
Yeah.

41:25.613 --> 41:27.864
You're never fed up?

41:28.014 --> 41:28.697
No,

41:30.189 --> 41:32.022
I'm pretty easy going.

41:34.389 --> 41:35.230
Oh.

41:35.380 --> 41:36.222
Yeah.

41:37.112 --> 41:39.159
I was out jogging the other day,

41:39.309 --> 41:43.226
and I turned the corner
and there was this guy,

41:45.050 --> 41:48.286
on a lazy chair eating
cat food out of a bowl,

41:48.436 --> 41:51.672
it's fucked up but I felt
like Buddha in the city

41:51.822 --> 41:52.922
seeing reality.

41:55.533 --> 41:59.449
And I just promised
myself that I'd appreciate

41:59.599 --> 42:00.872
what I have.

42:01.022 --> 42:01.705
Cool.

42:02.771 --> 42:04.161
I guess.

42:04.311 --> 42:06.882
Yeah, you should try that.

42:07.032 --> 42:09.069
You're not, the type to be angry?

42:09.219 --> 42:11.486
No, I'm not the angry type,

42:12.792 --> 42:16.625
I've been smoking pot
since elementary school.

42:17.933 --> 42:18.931
You got fired?

42:19.081 --> 42:19.789
Yeah.

42:19.939 --> 42:20.949
Seriously?

42:21.099 --> 42:21.797
Why?

42:21.947 --> 42:23.670
From my day job, not a
modeling gig, just my day job,

42:23.820 --> 42:25.337
and selling clothes.

42:26.291 --> 42:27.940
It sounds like a terrible job.

42:28.090 --> 42:31.261
It's really not, it's
not a terrible job.

42:31.411 --> 42:35.091
I, whatever, thank you so
much for picking me up today.

42:35.241 --> 42:38.420
Thank you, Oh my god
I need more girlfriends

42:38.570 --> 42:41.045
seriously, you know like
girls are just so hard

42:41.195 --> 42:43.489
to be friends with you
just can't trust them,

42:43.639 --> 42:45.783
like one second they're
like your best friend

42:45.933 --> 42:47.929
and the next minute they're
just like a total bitch,

42:48.079 --> 42:51.571
you know, hold on, I gotta text Hartley.

42:51.721 --> 42:52.571
Oh who's Hartley?

42:52.721 --> 42:53.571
He's my boyfriend.

42:53.721 --> 42:54.941
Oh.

42:55.091 --> 42:56.093
Do you have a boyfriend?

42:56.243 --> 42:56.941
No I don't.

42:57.091 --> 42:58.362
Do you want one?

42:58.512 --> 42:59.784
Not really no.

43:00.909 --> 43:01.912
Have you never been in love?

43:02.062 --> 43:02.921
No.

43:03.071 --> 43:03.780
Really?

43:03.930 --> 43:04.781
Never, never.

43:04.931 --> 43:05.933
I think I'm in love with Hartley.

43:06.083 --> 43:07.789
Oh, you think or you know?

43:07.939 --> 43:08.701
I know.

43:08.851 --> 43:10.103
What does he do?

43:10.253 --> 43:12.917
He's a self taught physical trainer,

43:13.067 --> 43:15.731
and he's an actor, like aspiring,

43:15.881 --> 43:17.064
and he's a poet.

43:18.573 --> 43:19.459
It's a lot of stuff.

43:19.609 --> 43:22.573
Yeah, he's sort of
like a renaissance man.

43:24.151 --> 43:24.984
You know.

43:30.611 --> 43:31.916
Hey girl.

43:32.066 --> 43:33.221

43:37.853 --> 43:39.353
I'm coming down.

43:44.569 --> 43:46.349
You should spend the
night, do you want to?

43:46.499 --> 43:47.703
Yeah.

43:47.853 --> 43:49.272
Yeah and then we can
get up in the morning

43:49.422 --> 43:52.013
really early and go to the gym.

43:52.163 --> 43:53.013
I'd love to.

46:09.209 --> 46:11.305
Yeah, I mean reps not 69 pounds.

46:11.455 --> 46:12.735
Woah.

46:12.885 --> 46:16.548
But you can do 69 pounds, right?

46:16.698 --> 46:19.625
Well, I know what I can do.

46:19.775 --> 46:20.458
Shut up.

46:22.569 --> 46:23.402
Okay.

46:25.609 --> 46:26.859
Water's fine.

46:28.787 --> 46:31.246
I just wanna sit down and
have a glass of water.

46:31.396 --> 46:32.728
What else should we get?

46:32.878 --> 46:33.561
Tartufos?

46:34.868 --> 46:35.715
Hmm.

46:35.865 --> 46:36.718
No, I'm not having a Sigoni,

46:36.868 --> 46:38.799
I'm not having a tartufo, no truffle.

46:38.949 --> 46:40.510
Do you know that when
the universe reaches

46:40.660 --> 46:42.868
zero degree kelvin,
there's gonna be a cascade.

46:43.018 --> 46:45.275
Do you know what that means?

46:45.425 --> 46:47.886
No I don't know anything
about interstellar physics.

46:48.036 --> 46:50.886
The big freeze, everything frozen,

46:51.785 --> 46:53.176
do you know how cold that is,

46:53.326 --> 46:56.960
that's like negative
459,67 degrees Fahrenheit.

46:57.110 --> 46:59.812
That's like cold like
they don't make coats

46:59.962 --> 47:02.665
for that kind of weather,
not even in Russia,

47:02.815 --> 47:05.665
so get ready, we're getting tartufo.

47:09.189 --> 47:12.329
Can we get the tartufo tasting menu also?

47:12.479 --> 47:13.567
I told you you were hungry.

47:13.717 --> 47:14.805
Please eat the whole thing.

47:14.955 --> 47:16.813
You're not having any?

47:16.963 --> 47:18.822
My stomach's acting funny.

47:22.985 --> 47:24.718
I thought you were gonna live it up,

47:24.868 --> 47:26.665
you know, talking about
black holes and stuff.

47:26.815 --> 47:29.006
Watching you eat is like living it up.

47:29.156 --> 47:29.839
Okay.

47:32.389 --> 47:33.873
Here's some more wine.

47:34.023 --> 47:35.358

47:42.589 --> 47:43.422
Cheers.

47:47.186 --> 47:48.936

47:51.448 --> 47:53.531

47:54.808 --> 47:57.308
I mean there's a whole bottle.

48:00.050 --> 48:02.285
Yeah, one glass is my limit,

48:02.435 --> 48:04.068
I've already had one.

48:04.218 --> 48:04.901
Yeah.

48:05.768 --> 48:07.565
We're having fun though we're celebrating.

48:07.715 --> 48:10.815
Okay but I don't wanna get plastered.

48:18.024 --> 48:19.218

48:34.344 --> 48:36.179
Wait.

48:47.144 --> 48:47.977
What?

48:49.768 --> 48:50.615
I can't eat this.

48:50.765 --> 48:51.780
I don't know that language.

48:51.930 --> 48:52.782
I can't eat this.

48:52.932 --> 48:53.784
Well I found eggs.

48:53.934 --> 48:54.636
Those are not eggs.

48:54.786 --> 48:55.985
They're egg whites
they're just the same.

48:56.135 --> 48:57.608
They're better for you.

48:57.758 --> 48:58.666
That's snot.

48:58.816 --> 48:59.725
It's not snot.

49:00.728 --> 49:02.615
Whats so funny.

49:02.765 --> 49:04.525
That show, remember when you...

49:04.675 --> 49:05.358
No.

49:08.008 --> 49:09.425
This is not cool.

49:15.405 --> 49:17.010
Well I don't feel very good.

49:17.160 --> 49:18.546
Why don't you feel very good?

49:18.696 --> 49:19.997
'Cause I ate like nine cupcakes

49:20.147 --> 49:21.430
'cause they were fucking delicious.

49:21.580 --> 49:22.737
You wanna look like a fucking hippo?

49:22.887 --> 49:24.111
No I don't wanna look like a hippo.

49:24.261 --> 49:25.998
Why would you eat nine cupcakes honey,

49:26.148 --> 49:27.885
when you have a salad in front of you

49:28.035 --> 49:29.018
why wouldn't you eat salad?

49:29.168 --> 49:30.211
Because cupcakes are better.

49:30.361 --> 49:31.317
Well why would they be better,

49:31.467 --> 49:32.274
this is much better for you.

49:32.424 --> 49:34.643
Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

49:34.793 --> 49:35.476
Enjoy.

49:39.565 --> 49:41.482
Thanks, don't listen.

49:43.986 --> 49:45.363

50:54.285 --> 50:56.118

50:57.145 --> 51:00.062
I don't know how to say this but,

51:03.026 --> 51:06.226
I heard some really
weird things last night.

51:06.376 --> 51:07.059
What?

51:09.069 --> 51:11.904
Well, there was some screaming,

51:12.054 --> 51:14.889
you and Hartley were screaming.

51:18.066 --> 51:19.117
Did he hurt you?

51:19.267 --> 51:20.319
No, no no no,

51:21.266 --> 51:24.119
that was his audition tape,

51:24.269 --> 51:26.509
he was doing a rape scene
and wanted feedback.

51:26.659 --> 51:28.695
You don't have to, you know,

51:28.845 --> 51:30.445
stick up for him, make up excuses for him.

51:30.595 --> 51:31.718
Why would I stick up for him?

51:31.868 --> 51:34.226
I dunno just saying you can talk to me.

51:34.376 --> 51:35.575
No he's so sweet.

51:35.725 --> 51:38.551
Did I tell you about our first date?

51:38.701 --> 51:41.528
He took me to get red velvet cupcakes,

51:41.678 --> 51:43.516
which are my favorite kind,

51:43.666 --> 51:46.546
and I ate like five of
them, and then he was like

51:46.696 --> 51:47.996
do you want to come back to my place,

51:48.146 --> 51:50.841
there's this poem that
I really wanna read you.

51:50.991 --> 51:53.537
Oh sure, a
poem, you fell for that?

51:53.687 --> 51:55.341
I didn't fall for anything
he wanted to take me back

51:55.491 --> 51:57.725
to read me a poem and then
he did and it was a really

51:57.875 --> 52:00.109
good like deep inspirational
poem and like I cried,

52:00.259 --> 52:01.276
we both cried.

52:02.445 --> 52:04.728
And then he got really hard, you know,

52:04.878 --> 52:05.916
and then he took his pants off,

52:06.066 --> 52:08.045
and then he pulled his
dick out and he was like

52:08.195 --> 52:09.527
would you please just suck it.

52:09.677 --> 52:10.375
Oh my God.

52:10.525 --> 52:11.926
Yeah, but it was like
sweet, it wasn't like creepy

52:12.076 --> 52:13.805
at all 'cause he said
it in such a nice way.

52:13.955 --> 52:14.818
It was like so gentle,

52:14.968 --> 52:17.175
and so I was doing it, and it was dark,

52:17.325 --> 52:20.269
and he was really into it
but I have a really intense

52:20.419 --> 52:22.648
gag reflex so I threw
up all over his dick.

52:25.106 --> 52:26.031
Oh shit.

52:26.181 --> 52:27.076
Yeah.

52:27.226 --> 52:27.971

52:28.121 --> 52:28.978
And I was like Oh my god I'm so sorry

52:29.128 --> 52:30.125
I just puked all over
your dick and he was like

52:30.275 --> 52:31.138

52:31.288 --> 52:33.436

to God we had sex three times

52:40.362 --> 52:43.789
and he was just thinking
about his ex the entire time.

52:43.939 --> 52:44.898
How do you know?

52:45.048 --> 52:47.111

psychic thing, you know,

52:49.475 --> 52:50.595

52:54.697 --> 52:57.186
No, don't call him, you know.

52:57.336 --> 52:59.826

55:05.357 --> 55:08.248
Thank you, you're more beautiful.

55:08.398 --> 55:09.469
No I'm not, you are.

55:09.619 --> 55:10.302
Thanks.

55:11.186 --> 55:14.706
You can't say that, you're beautifuler.

55:14.856 --> 55:15.799
You're beautifuler.

55:15.949 --> 55:17.475
You know that's not a word either.

55:17.625 --> 55:20.626
It's not a word, I'm
not very good with words.

55:25.266 --> 55:26.433
You're so shy.

55:37.080 --> 55:39.163
Fuck, I can't get it all.

55:43.549 --> 55:44.382
Goddammit.

55:49.586 --> 55:53.482
Yeah so I'm gonna need the
house to myself tonight,

55:53.632 --> 55:57.528
I have to throw up in private,
I can't get it all out

55:57.678 --> 55:59.448
when there's just like
people around listening,

55:59.598 --> 56:02.349
no offense, I love you but like, I just...

56:02.499 --> 56:04.099
I wasn't listening.

56:06.285 --> 56:08.618
That's what you think I did?

56:09.549 --> 56:11.314
I mean I'm sorry you think that.

56:11.464 --> 56:13.079
I don't know if you were listening

56:13.229 --> 56:14.706
it doesn't matter I just
like for my own health

56:14.856 --> 56:17.873
and well being it's better for my mind

56:19.768 --> 56:21.935
if I can do it in private.

56:27.986 --> 56:29.029
Hey?

56:29.179 --> 56:30.222
Hey.

56:31.128 --> 56:33.063
You should leave your stuff.

56:33.213 --> 56:35.149
You're coming back tomorrow.

56:35.299 --> 56:36.167
Oh.

56:36.317 --> 56:38.039
Yeah.

56:38.189 --> 56:39.439
You're right.

56:41.626 --> 56:42.459
Yeah.

56:53.148 --> 56:55.090
I'm glad we met.

56:55.240 --> 56:55.977
Me too.

56:56.127 --> 56:57.788
You're like the best friend I never had.

56:57.938 --> 56:58.621
Me too.

57:00.050 --> 57:00.975
Really?

57:01.125 --> 57:02.032
Yeah!

57:02.182 --> 57:02.977
Really?

57:03.127 --> 57:03.923
Hmm-Hmm.

57:05.266 --> 57:08.418
Okay.

57:08.568 --> 57:09.420
What's going on?

57:09.570 --> 57:13.106
Sorry, I don't know, I'm
just like weirdly emotional.

57:17.308 --> 57:20.172
Things that are bad are equally good.

57:20.322 --> 57:23.186
Try to look at the bright side of things.

57:23.336 --> 57:25.218
Why are you quoting Dr. Seuss?

57:25.368 --> 57:27.613
I don't know, it just came into my head.

57:27.763 --> 57:30.008
Sometimes quotes just come into my head.

57:30.158 --> 57:30.925
I love you.

57:31.967 --> 57:33.407
I love you too, what's...

57:33.557 --> 57:35.559
I'll just miss you.

57:35.709 --> 57:37.824
Am I gonna see you soon?

57:37.974 --> 57:38.909
Yeah totally.

57:39.059 --> 57:39.995
Like tomorrow.

57:44.928 --> 57:48.509
Okay, alright, call
me if you need anything.

57:48.659 --> 57:49.342
I will.

58:43.090 --> 58:45.149
Sit tight, don't let the bed bugs bite.

59:11.527 --> 59:12.926
Look at this puppy on top of a kitten.

59:23.213 --> 59:24.046
Oh my God.

59:25.229 --> 59:26.658
I like the little ones the best,

59:26.808 --> 59:29.330
the little shitty ones that are just like.

59:41.369 --> 59:42.519
What?

59:42.669 --> 59:44.089
I think you have bed bugs.

59:44.239 --> 59:45.006
Bed bugs?

59:48.730 --> 59:52.060
I definitely don't have bed bugs,

59:52.210 --> 59:54.522
you must've gotten them from someone else.

59:54.672 --> 59:56.985
Listen, I'm flying to New York next week,

59:57.135 --> 59:59.543
I'll FedEx you your stuff.

59:59.693 --> 01:00:03.385
You don't have my
mailing address, do you?

01:00:03.535 --> 01:00:04.390
I think I lost you,

01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:05.557
Spring, hello?

01:00:10.189 --> 01:00:13.272
I don't have bed bugs, ugh, psycho.

01:00:56.251 --> 01:00:57.084
Hi.

01:00:59.053 --> 01:01:00.303
Hi Jarred Hi.

01:01:02.072 --> 01:01:05.155
Where is the address for the casting?

01:01:08.370 --> 01:01:09.203
Hi!

01:01:15.629 --> 01:01:16.462
Hi.

01:01:27.330 --> 01:01:29.497
Hi, I'm so sorry I'm late.

01:01:31.394 --> 01:01:33.032
You should have called.

01:01:33.182 --> 01:01:34.821
You bring your heels?

01:01:36.392 --> 01:01:37.522
I didn't.

01:01:37.672 --> 01:01:38.927
You didn't bring your heels?

01:01:39.077 --> 01:01:40.183
They're at the cleaner's.

01:01:40.333 --> 01:01:42.511
Oh, at the dry cleaner's, fascinating,

01:01:42.661 --> 01:01:44.178
get in let's go, go.

01:01:47.234 --> 01:01:49.004
Straighten up straighten up.

01:01:49.154 --> 01:01:51.117
Stop, what is that shit on your face?

01:01:51.267 --> 01:01:53.231
This is what I mean about cleaner's,

01:01:53.381 --> 01:01:55.371
I have a bed bug infestation.

01:01:55.521 --> 01:01:56.492
But don't worry.

01:01:56.642 --> 01:01:57.551
Don't you worry.

01:01:57.701 --> 01:01:58.610
They're gone.

01:01:58.760 --> 01:01:59.602
Get off.

01:01:59.752 --> 01:02:01.397
They spread in fabric but you're safe

01:02:01.547 --> 01:02:05.474
because I take precautions,
I washed my outfit

01:02:05.624 --> 01:02:06.773
this morning.

01:02:06.923 --> 01:02:08.072
Get out, quickly.

01:02:13.154 --> 01:02:15.272
Yeah, it didn't.

01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:17.842
It didn't go well.

01:02:17.992 --> 01:02:19.592
You can't fucking afford
to do this anymore, okay?

01:02:19.742 --> 01:02:21.832
The clients aren't gonna put up with it.

01:02:21.982 --> 01:02:23.481
Just fucking show up on time.

01:02:23.631 --> 01:02:25.677
Wear the fucking wardrobe
they ask you to wear,

01:02:25.827 --> 01:02:28.364
and be the fucking girl
they want you to be.

01:02:28.514 --> 01:02:31.052
I don't, I don't think
I can keep doing this.

01:02:31.202 --> 01:02:31.885
I'm sorry.

01:02:32.770 --> 01:02:36.187
DOn't be a fucking quitter, try harder.

01:02:39.053 --> 01:02:40.970
Fucking die, ugh, fuck!

01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:56.870
Do you read the bible, I read the bible.

01:02:58.650 --> 01:03:00.119
I'm an atheist.

01:03:00.269 --> 01:03:02.620
That's okay, you can't not love the

01:03:02.770 --> 01:03:04.873
because you don't believe, then what kind

01:03:05.023 --> 01:03:06.373
of person are you?

01:03:08.557 --> 01:03:09.390
Last week,

01:03:10.829 --> 01:03:12.746
I was feeling suicidal,

01:03:16.554 --> 01:03:19.387
but then I went home and I prayed,

01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:22.530
I'm praying for you now.

01:03:23.730 --> 01:03:25.730
I used to be a cry baby.

01:03:26.904 --> 01:03:28.904
I used to cry, cry, cry,

01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:33.195
and then someone told
me your soul is home.

01:03:33.345 --> 01:03:35.671
I couldn't believe in what I couldn't see.

01:03:35.821 --> 01:03:37.504
I believe in miracles.

01:03:40.249 --> 01:03:41.832
You are my miracle.

01:04:22.793 --> 01:04:24.284
Sugar?

01:04:24.434 --> 01:04:25.684
Yeah, thanks.

01:04:29.477 --> 01:04:30.727
Ah that's good.

01:04:37.353 --> 01:04:38.186
Hmm.

01:04:44.553 --> 01:04:45.720
Thank you dad.

01:04:50.217 --> 01:04:51.050
Bye.

01:05:20.534 --> 01:05:23.451
What, you don't like the drawing?

01:05:29.257 --> 01:05:30.104
Hey hej hey,

01:05:30.254 --> 01:05:31.603
Toni's start at $15 and
I'm gonna haul a 15.

01:05:31.753 --> 01:05:35.920
Picture's already posted
on Instagram and Facebook.

01:05:38.772 --> 01:05:43.249
Don't wait too long, it's a
limited time offer for a week.

01:05:43.399 --> 01:05:44.499
No thank you.

01:05:51.433 --> 01:05:53.155
Oh, it wasn't the least bit interesting,

01:05:53.305 --> 01:05:54.405
it was idiotic.

01:05:56.013 --> 01:05:57.805
Fair enough.

01:05:57.955 --> 01:05:59.461
I mean you weren't just
one of those dumb models,

01:05:59.611 --> 01:06:01.294
if you were we wouldn't be friends but,

01:06:01.444 --> 01:06:03.711
those photos were disgusting.

01:06:04.995 --> 01:06:07.803
Well not you necessarily, but the photos

01:06:07.953 --> 01:06:10.761
were fucking awful they were unbearable.

01:06:10.911 --> 01:06:12.166
I can't tell you how glad I am

01:06:12.316 --> 01:06:13.571
that you're done with that phase.

01:06:13.721 --> 01:06:14.654
It's so ugly.

01:06:17.571 --> 01:06:18.424
When you told me you got scouted,

01:06:18.574 --> 01:06:20.931
I was so suspicious
that suddenly you wanted

01:06:21.081 --> 01:06:22.014
to be famous.

01:06:23.171 --> 01:06:25.246
I just wanted good photos,

01:06:25.396 --> 01:06:27.840
I never wanted to be famous.

01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:30.435
I've wanted to be famous.

01:06:30.585 --> 01:06:31.685
Yes you have.

01:06:32.691 --> 01:06:35.052
But no just famous for being famous,

01:06:35.202 --> 01:06:37.805
to be recognize for what I do,

01:06:37.955 --> 01:06:40.205
but, that doesn't interest me anymore.

01:06:40.355 --> 01:06:43.949
God I used to be obsessed
with it but it's petty,

01:06:44.099 --> 01:06:47.693
it innate it's for people
that need to get a life.

01:06:47.843 --> 01:06:50.051
China has changed everything.

01:06:50.201 --> 01:06:50.884
Wake up.

01:06:54.732 --> 01:06:56.205
Stop.

01:06:56.355 --> 01:06:57.541
Wake up Irene.

01:06:57.691 --> 01:06:58.548
Stop!

01:06:58.698 --> 01:06:59.550
Wake up!

01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:00.403
Stop.

01:07:00.553 --> 01:07:01.955
You're not famous.

01:07:02.105 --> 01:07:03.443
I know.

01:07:03.593 --> 01:07:04.593
I know that.

01:07:10.435 --> 01:07:13.795
Arthur called my modeling
pictures disgusting.

01:07:13.945 --> 01:07:15.725
Don't worry about the pictures,

01:07:15.875 --> 01:07:18.478
you tried being who
people wanted you to be

01:07:18.628 --> 01:07:20.718
and you learned to say no.

01:07:20.868 --> 01:07:21.836
It's good.

01:07:21.986 --> 01:07:22.955
It's normal.

01:07:23.875 --> 01:07:26.011
Arthur loves criticizing you.

01:07:26.161 --> 01:07:28.297
Now he's leaving, and I must say,

01:07:28.447 --> 01:07:30.137
I'm really glad about that.

01:07:30.287 --> 01:07:31.827
Thanks for reminding me,

01:07:31.977 --> 01:07:34.057
he's the only interesting person I know.

01:07:34.207 --> 01:07:35.245
He belittles you,

01:07:35.395 --> 01:07:37.936
and when you're with him you
just lose all your confidence.

01:07:38.086 --> 01:07:39.769
Look forget about him,

01:07:41.897 --> 01:07:44.064
you're on different parts.

01:07:50.798 --> 01:07:51.631
Come on.

01:08:09.184 --> 01:08:10.184
There we go.

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:14.603
I've always wanted to look in here.

01:08:35.781 --> 01:08:36.852
I use to have to like erase everything

01:08:37.002 --> 01:08:39.167
over and over again, and
then one day I just said,

01:08:39.317 --> 01:08:41.662
you know what, why are you
second guessing yourself

01:08:41.813 --> 01:08:44.160
when you have everything
you could fucking need

01:08:44.310 --> 01:08:45.551
into yourself.

01:08:45.701 --> 01:08:47.140
And once I did that,
Once I gave into that,

01:08:47.291 --> 01:08:48.751
there was no fucking stopping me,

01:08:48.901 --> 01:08:51.818
on the last day of class,
professor professor Wyatt

01:08:51.968 --> 01:08:53.871
says there's sentiment in your work.

01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:56.901
The unteachable magic fucking ingredient,

01:08:57.051 --> 01:08:58.401
and like I got it.

01:09:00.442 --> 01:09:01.899
Wait, where's the sentiment, everywhere?

01:09:02.049 --> 01:09:04.020
Oh yeah all the, that one.

01:09:04.170 --> 01:09:06.142
Yeah that one, that one.

01:09:08.384 --> 01:09:11.892
I didn't that you even wanted to draw,

01:09:12.042 --> 01:09:15.200
this seems like it's
really out of the blue.

01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:17.312
I know I never gave myself a chance.

01:09:17.462 --> 01:09:19.424
I'm sad that you're moving so far away,

01:09:19.573 --> 01:09:21.256
are you gonna miss me?

01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:26.098
I need a cigarette Oh
my god, I'm so excited.

01:09:27.402 --> 01:09:29.819
I'm getting out of here wooh!

01:09:35.081 --> 01:09:36.362
Hey you should come with me.

01:09:36.511 --> 01:09:37.279
To China?

01:09:39.402 --> 01:09:40.250
Yes.

01:09:40.399 --> 01:09:42.477
Yeah you would love it there

01:09:42.627 --> 01:09:44.554
you'll fucking love Beijing,

01:09:44.703 --> 01:09:47.504
and you can make, you can
teach english there, and...

01:09:47.654 --> 01:09:50.059
But what about the language problem,

01:09:50.209 --> 01:09:51.850
I don't speak Chinese.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.104
I could teach you all that.

01:09:54.255 --> 01:09:56.361
You can, you'll teach me?

01:09:56.511 --> 01:09:57.750
Yes.

01:09:57.900 --> 01:09:59.424
I had no idea you wanted
me to come with you.

01:09:59.574 --> 01:10:01.012
Of course I want you to come with me.

01:10:01.162 --> 01:10:06.060
Well in that case, I'll
study mandarin for a year

01:10:06.210 --> 01:10:07.631
and just leave up.

01:10:07.781 --> 01:10:08.975
Are you fucking serious?

01:10:09.125 --> 01:10:10.148
I'm fucking serious.

01:10:10.298 --> 01:10:11.243
Fucking serious?

01:10:11.393 --> 01:10:12.338
I'm fucking serious.

01:10:12.488 --> 01:10:13.231
This is crazy.

01:10:13.381 --> 01:10:14.761
It's so crazy but it's so right.

01:10:14.911 --> 01:10:15.831
I feel good.

01:10:15.981 --> 01:10:16.867
You feel good.

01:10:17.017 --> 01:10:17.754
This feels good.

01:10:17.904 --> 01:10:18.901
It feels right, right?

01:10:19.051 --> 01:10:19.910
I feel you.

01:10:20.060 --> 01:10:20.913
You feel me?

01:10:21.063 --> 01:10:21.917
And I feel this.

01:10:22.067 --> 01:10:22.772
You feel this?

01:10:22.922 --> 01:10:23.770
And it feels right.

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:24.845
That's it, we're gonna live together,

01:10:24.995 --> 01:10:25.920
we're gonna make art, we're gonna be part

01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:26.831
of the community.

01:10:26.981 --> 01:10:28.271
I really didn't wanna leave you behind.

01:10:28.421 --> 01:10:31.744
Me neither, but we'll
have to convince my parents.

01:10:31.894 --> 01:10:35.301
Well, yeah, I'll take care of that,

01:10:35.451 --> 01:10:36.460
I'll call them tonight,

01:10:36.610 --> 01:10:37.456
You will?

01:10:37.606 --> 01:10:38.311
Yes!

01:10:38.461 --> 01:10:39.311
Go call them.

01:10:39.461 --> 01:10:40.314
I'll call them tonight.

01:10:40.464 --> 01:10:41.461
I'll make 'em an offer they can't refuse.

01:10:41.611 --> 01:10:42.327
Oh yeah?

01:10:42.477 --> 01:10:46.477
Yeah I'm giving you the
life they never could.

01:10:47.898 --> 01:10:49.028
So?

01:10:49.178 --> 01:10:50.678
So what darling?

01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:56.960
What do you think about
Arthur, China, everything?

01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:59.520
Do you really need to ask me that?

01:10:59.670 --> 01:11:01.668
You know I am not happy.

01:11:01.818 --> 01:11:03.628
You're just following your friend

01:11:03.778 --> 01:11:06.821
like you've done since
you were 10 years old.

01:11:06.971 --> 01:11:08.470
You don't think I could benefit

01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:10.119
from moving to another country,

01:11:10.269 --> 01:11:11.370
learning a new language,

01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:13.732
immersing myself in a new culture.

01:11:13.882 --> 01:11:16.228
Absolutely, you know
that I'm all for that.

01:11:16.378 --> 01:11:20.122
But why not think of going
to London, or Paris, Berlin.

01:11:20.272 --> 01:11:23.098
It's too easy,
everything's been done there.

01:11:23.248 --> 01:11:24.612
I want a fresh start.

01:11:24.762 --> 01:11:27.748
Arthur will help me
- So it's the same?

01:11:27.898 --> 01:11:31.078
Oh, story, will you stop
dragging Arthur Arthur Arthur,

01:11:31.228 --> 01:11:33.846
when will you finally
get a mind of your own?

01:11:33.996 --> 01:11:36.072
He's feeling scared about this whole thing

01:11:36.222 --> 01:11:38.298
and of course he wants to take you along.

01:11:38.448 --> 01:11:40.078
Have a friend, have a buddy.

01:11:40.228 --> 01:11:41.709
Somebody to support him.

01:11:41.859 --> 01:11:44.741
I would like to see you
follow what you need to do,

01:11:44.891 --> 01:11:46.241
and take the lead.

01:11:50.101 --> 01:11:52.772
Can I come in?

01:11:52.922 --> 01:11:56.700
Come in yes of course you can come in.

01:11:56.850 --> 01:11:59.061
You really don't have to knock.

01:11:59.211 --> 01:12:00.267
Hi.

01:12:00.417 --> 01:12:01.474
Sit.

01:12:03.582 --> 01:12:04.415
So?

01:12:06.241 --> 01:12:08.391
Mom and I talked about Arthur today.

01:12:08.541 --> 01:12:10.741
She said that you
weren't too excited about

01:12:10.891 --> 01:12:13.408
me moving off to China with him.

01:12:14.261 --> 01:12:16.005
And that couldn't have
been surprising to you.

01:12:16.155 --> 01:12:17.505
No, I guess not.

01:12:19.584 --> 01:12:22.467
I thought about it, and
I think communication

01:12:22.617 --> 01:12:25.500
is going to be a very
difficult all of my life,

01:12:25.650 --> 01:12:29.450
wherever I go, whatever language I speak.

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:33.955
I mean don't understand
in general, other people.

01:12:34.105 --> 01:12:38.461
But I do wanna make something
that speaks to others.

01:12:38.611 --> 01:12:40.492
And what is that?

01:12:40.642 --> 01:12:43.364
I don't know yet, I
mean I haven't tried,

01:12:43.514 --> 01:12:46.384
but I do want them to understand me.

01:12:46.534 --> 01:12:47.467
I don't know.

01:12:49.882 --> 01:12:52.442
So you want people to understand you

01:12:52.592 --> 01:12:54.522
and so you're moving to China?

01:12:57.023 --> 01:12:58.021
Does that make sense?

01:12:58.171 --> 01:12:59.391
No.

01:12:59.541 --> 01:13:00.922
That's like really extreme.

01:13:01.072 --> 01:13:01.922
Yeah, but.

01:13:06.704 --> 01:13:08.382
I wanna make something
that's important to me.

01:13:08.532 --> 01:13:10.784
That pleases you?

01:13:10.934 --> 01:13:11.617
Yeah.

01:13:12.725 --> 01:13:14.570
Yeah, that's like the place to start.

01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:18.805
You know, I mean that's
what, that's what I do,

01:13:18.955 --> 01:13:21.972
I make art because it's the only thing

01:13:23.584 --> 01:13:25.672
that makes me happy.

01:13:25.822 --> 01:13:28.926
If I'm not painting or
drawing I'm heartbroken,

01:13:29.076 --> 01:13:32.181
you know, and you know
I'm sad most of the time

01:13:32.331 --> 01:13:34.848
because I don't painy, you know.

01:13:37.845 --> 01:13:40.122
So you don't think I'll
find something like that

01:13:40.272 --> 01:13:41.242
in China?

01:13:41.392 --> 01:13:41.925
No.

01:13:42.075 --> 01:13:42.908
I don't.

01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:45.274
Okay.

01:13:45.424 --> 01:13:49.591
SO my advice to you is to
find another something else.

01:13:52.021 --> 01:13:53.104
Forget China.

01:13:57.181 --> 01:13:58.800
Did you want my advice?

01:13:58.950 --> 01:14:00.031
I did.

01:14:00.181 --> 01:14:01.184
Is that why you came in?

01:14:01.334 --> 01:14:02.031
Yeah.

01:14:02.181 --> 01:14:04.251
Okay, well there it is,

01:14:04.401 --> 01:14:06.471
now go, I have work to do.

01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:05.747
Now imagine that everyday.

01:15:08.704 --> 01:15:10.204
Are you impressed?

01:15:15.024 --> 01:15:16.857
What's wrong with you?

01:15:19.901 --> 01:15:20.734
Irene?

01:15:23.102 --> 01:15:24.410
Why are you walking away?

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:27.643
I don't think I wanna live with you

01:15:28.981 --> 01:15:31.314
if I end up moving to China.

01:15:33.182 --> 01:15:34.181
You don't have any other friends.

01:15:34.331 --> 01:15:35.971
Neither do you.

01:15:36.121 --> 01:15:38.361
Why are you being so mean?

01:15:38.511 --> 01:15:39.361
Irene don't,

01:15:40.501 --> 01:15:41.927
Irene,

01:15:42.077 --> 01:15:45.457
Irene!

01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:57.240
That's it,

01:16:03.221 --> 01:16:04.888
good, now some here.

01:16:18.261 --> 01:16:20.880
Very good, just dump the rest there.

01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:21.791
Just dump it?

01:16:21.941 --> 01:16:23.774
Oh careful, hang on.

01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:37.231
Okay.

01:16:37.381 --> 01:16:40.131
Very good, thank you, good job.

01:16:45.441 --> 01:16:46.848
Nothing is happening for me here,

01:16:46.998 --> 01:16:48.144
the gallery initiative is pointless,

01:16:48.294 --> 01:16:49.291
my supervisor is a young american cunt

01:16:49.441 --> 01:16:52.282
whose sole purpose in life
is to yell at me all day,

01:16:52.432 --> 01:16:53.660
you get all the pollution,
the lack of basic

01:16:53.810 --> 01:16:55.322
human courtesy, I need you here now,

01:16:55.472 --> 01:16:56.971
why haven't you left yet?

01:16:57.121 --> 01:16:58.621
I'm not moving to China.

01:16:58.771 --> 01:17:00.191
I'm making a movie.

01:17:00.341 --> 01:17:02.101

01:17:02.251 --> 01:17:03.531

and saving up with an office job.

01:17:06.901 --> 01:17:09.376
