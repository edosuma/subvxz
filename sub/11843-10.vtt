00:01.114 --> 00:04.447
- Previously on Roswell. - I once knew someone like you.

00:04.518 --> 00:06.986
Do you know where I can find him?

00:07.087 --> 00:09.647
- Shouldn't we, like, talk or something. - About what?

00:09.756 --> 00:11.280
I have one more thing to show you.

00:11.391 --> 00:14.827
So this has some type of meaning. It's some kind of message for us.

00:14.928 --> 00:18.694
Alex... Max, Michael and Isabel, they aren't from around here.

00:18.765 --> 00:21.825
Where are they from?

00:21.902 --> 00:26.339
I'm alone, and that's the way it's gotta be. Maybe we should've never started this.

00:26.406 --> 00:30.308
- You don't believe me, do you? - I believe that you believe.

00:30.377 --> 00:33.813
- If I don't go right now, things are gonna change. - Change how?

00:40.487 --> 00:43.285
[Liz Narrating] There are days when everything seems wrong...

00:43.357 --> 00:46.690
when little things just irk you for no good reason.

00:46.760 --> 00:50.787
And then there are days like today when the worldjust sings to you...

00:50.864 --> 00:52.957
from the minute you open your eyes in the morning...

00:53.033 --> 00:55.331
till the minute you shut them again at night.

00:55.402 --> 00:58.929
Days when you actually enjoy cleaning the milk shake machine.

01:28.802 --> 01:32.238
I'm, uh, really in the mood for a piece of...

01:32.305 --> 01:34.273
Men in Blackberry pie.

01:34.341 --> 01:38.209
- Why, is there something wrong? - Compared to nuclear winter, no.

01:38.278 --> 01:42.112
- What are you doing? - Max likes cherry cola.

01:42.182 --> 01:46.118
- What does Michael like? - Cherry cola with arsenic?

01:46.219 --> 01:49.848
Can we please leave? I'll buy you a whole one at the House of Pies.

01:49.923 --> 01:52.756
What's your problem, Michael? I thought maybe you'd want to see Maria.

01:52.826 --> 01:54.987
We kind of broke up.

01:55.061 --> 01:57.894
What? Why didn't you tell me?

01:57.964 --> 02:00.125
I don't... I'm not sure if we did or didn't.

02:00.200 --> 02:02.225
I mean, it's confusing.

02:03.837 --> 02:06.635
Cherry cola, on the house.

02:06.706 --> 02:09.698
Hmph. Yours is $1.25.

02:09.776 --> 02:13.576
I guess it's not really confusing anymore, is it?

02:26.893 --> 02:28.827
- What's this? - Put that away.

02:28.895 --> 02:32.922
- Now, I know this. This is from... - Not here, Michael.

02:32.999 --> 02:35.968

03:33.493 --> 03:35.552
- Anyone I know? - Alex, where have you been?

03:35.629 --> 03:37.620
We've been looking for you the last couple of days.

03:37.697 --> 03:42.464
Oh, well, I've been feeling, you know, a little rocky about... things, you know?

03:42.536 --> 03:44.697
So I took some time, you know?

03:44.771 --> 03:47.467
A little personal reflection, a little research.

03:47.541 --> 03:50.999
So, um, where did you come out in all of this?

03:51.044 --> 03:53.205
Well, I've got two theories.

03:53.280 --> 03:57.182
One is that, uh, you and Liz have been brainwashed by a drug cult.

03:57.250 --> 03:59.480
- Yes? - And the other is...

03:59.553 --> 04:03.853
I'm trapped inside some extremely long, extremely weird nightmare.

04:03.924 --> 04:07.087
Yeah, well, the first couple of days were pretty tough for me too...

04:07.160 --> 04:10.186
but trust me, they will not hurt you.

04:10.263 --> 04:12.458
I mean, physically.

04:12.532 --> 04:15.763
What actually makes you believe in any of this?

04:15.835 --> 04:19.032
Well, I guess when Liz was shot...

04:19.105 --> 04:22.370
and Max dissolved the bullet into nothingness...

04:22.475 --> 04:24.443
and then repaired the damages inside of her...

04:24.544 --> 04:26.705
that would have otherwise left her dead.

04:26.780 --> 04:30.181
I guess that kind of changed my thinking. [Chuckles]

04:30.250 --> 04:33.777
Well, I guess maybe I should talk with one of them directly.

04:33.887 --> 04:36.879
- Yeah. - Maybe Isabel.

04:36.957 --> 04:40.518
Isabel. One piece of advice, okay?

04:40.594 --> 04:42.687
Don't get involved with them.

04:42.762 --> 04:44.889
I mean, look at me and Michael.

04:44.965 --> 04:48.958
Granted, the passion was outrageous...

04:49.035 --> 04:52.300
but in the end, they're...

04:52.372 --> 04:54.704
[Chuckles] They're pretty heartless.

04:54.808 --> 04:56.969
I just drew it from memory.

04:57.043 --> 04:59.910
It was painted on the wall of the cave that River Dog took us to.

04:59.980 --> 05:02.210
I don't even know if it means anything.

05:02.282 --> 05:05.046
Of course, it means something. Why else would we all recognize it?

05:05.118 --> 05:08.576
Just like the pendant, Max. It's like our language or something.

05:08.688 --> 05:11.486
It's familiar, but I can't seem to remember how to read it.

05:11.558 --> 05:14.891
What I want to know is how long were you planning on keeping this from us, Max?

05:14.961 --> 05:16.895
Too much was happening, Michael.

05:16.963 --> 05:19.488
Topolsky was all over us, and I couldn't risk that...

05:22.469 --> 05:24.960
I just thought I should wait, that's all.

05:25.038 --> 05:27.097
No, no, no. Go ahead and finish that.

05:27.173 --> 05:29.505
You couldn't take the risk that, what...

05:29.576 --> 05:31.908
- I'd go do something stupid? - That's not what I said.

05:31.978 --> 05:34.640
- No, you didn't have to. - I'm sure Max had his reasons.

05:34.748 --> 05:37.876
Yeah, that he couldn't trust me with that. But he could trust Liz.

05:37.951 --> 05:39.919
She was there. I couldn't just...

05:42.155 --> 05:44.817
Why am I defending myself? This is exactly why I didn't tell you.

05:44.891 --> 05:47.052
Because you would jump to some wild conclusion...

05:47.127 --> 05:49.391
and go off and do something crazy without even telling us.

05:49.462 --> 05:53.296
I didn't think that was particularly wise with the F.B.I. Following us around.

05:53.366 --> 05:55.596
You should have told us, Max.

05:55.669 --> 05:59.400
[Diane] Max, honey? Liz is here.

06:01.941 --> 06:04.569
We're just... goin' out.

06:04.644 --> 06:07.112
- [Michael] You're going out? - What? Like on a date?

06:07.147 --> 06:09.741
No, not at all.

06:09.849 --> 06:11.942
We both just kind of felt like Chinese food.

06:12.052 --> 06:14.748
- It's no big deal. - Why are you changing your shirt?

06:14.821 --> 06:16.755
I'm late.

06:16.823 --> 06:19.553
We'll figure out the questions we want to ask...

06:19.626 --> 06:22.094
and then we'll go back to River Dog together, okay?

06:22.162 --> 06:24.687
Please, Michael. Leave it alone for now.

06:24.764 --> 06:26.732
Fine. I'll wait.

06:28.034 --> 06:30.559
We'll talk when I get back.

[Both Sigh]

06:34.340 --> 06:37.309
Do you ever wonder what else he tells Liz he doesn't tell us?

06:37.377 --> 06:40.972
Oh, please. You're one to talk. What have you been whispering in Maria's ear lately?

06:41.081 --> 06:43.675
- At least I'm smart enough not to get attached. - [Scoffs]

06:43.783 --> 06:46.251
I can walk away from anybody if I have to.

06:46.319 --> 06:49.846
- What is that supposed to mean? - It means I'm not gonna let Max's mistakes...

06:49.923 --> 06:52.756
keep me from finding out what I need to know.

06:54.994 --> 06:57.258
Come on, Michael, you promised.

Well, Eddie, I'm somebody lookin' for River Dog.

07:35.668 --> 07:38.933
Hmph. He's busy in the tent.

07:41.241 --> 07:43.334
It's a sacred ritual.

07:43.409 --> 07:45.809
You can't go in unless somebody invites you.

07:45.879 --> 07:48.677
- So invite me. - It's a sweat.

07:48.748 --> 07:52.775
It's a spiritual cleansing. It's intense.

07:52.886 --> 07:55.821

Fine. I'm not an alien. Whatever you say.

08:16.242 --> 08:19.177
Okay, then let's just say it were possible, all right?

08:19.245 --> 08:22.271
Why on earth would... Excuse the phrase.

08:22.382 --> 08:24.441
Why would you be sent here to begin with?

08:24.517 --> 08:26.815
I mean, what purpose could you possibly have?

08:26.886 --> 08:31.152
To wipe out the world, one annoying teenager at a time.

08:31.224 --> 08:34.022
Sorry.

08:35.962 --> 08:38.658
[Sighs] We don't know.

08:55.949 --> 08:59.783
I mean, haven't you ever felt different from everybody else?

08:59.853 --> 09:02.048

09:02.121 --> 09:05.022
they just would never understand.

We're just as human as you are, Alex...

- And I got really dizzy. Did you get dizzy? - [Giggles]

16:19.692 --> 16:22.388
- I get dizzy just thinking about it. - Okay, you know, like...

16:22.461 --> 16:25.157
all that time I spent with Kyle, I didn't have any of those feelings...

16:25.231 --> 16:27.222
that I did when I was with Max.

16:27.333 --> 16:29.961
- What about you? - Mmm, Doug Sohn in the eighth grade...

16:30.069 --> 16:32.537
- Yeah. - Amateur. Michael is the real thing.

16:32.638 --> 16:36.005
Here is the big question: Do you think that we feel like this...

16:36.075 --> 16:38.066
just because of the fact that they're, like...

16:38.144 --> 16:40.942
- Oh, their nonhuman status. - Right.

16:41.013 --> 16:45.143
- What if they've, like, ruined it for us with anyone else? - Yeah.

16:45.217 --> 16:47.617
Leave it to Michael to just wreak havoc on the rest of my life...

16:47.687 --> 16:51.248
- even though he wants no part of it. - He'll change his mind.

16:51.324 --> 16:55.351
I don't think so. And besides, I've come to the conclusion that it can never happen.

16:55.428 --> 16:58.886
I mean, human-alien relationships are bound to be disasters.

16:58.931 --> 17:02.423
Just don't think that you can enter into something with Max...

17:02.535 --> 17:07.165
and expect not to get... hurt in the end of it.

17:07.273 --> 17:11.505
I mean, me? I'm Teflon, babe.

17:11.577 --> 17:15.069
Michael starts acting like a total loser... I just walk away.

17:15.147 --> 17:18.207
But you and Max, ahh...

17:18.284 --> 17:21.276
you guys have got that whole...

17:21.354 --> 17:24.687
Iook-into-my-eyes, soul-mate thing.

17:27.226 --> 17:30.821
Um, yeah, you know, this...

17:30.896 --> 17:33.990
this whole thing is just, it's gonna work out.

17:34.066 --> 17:37.627
We just have to be prepared for anything that comes our way.

17:39.305 --> 17:41.705
[Sighs]

17:46.278 --> 17:48.838
This place gives me the creeps.

17:48.914 --> 17:51.178
Yeah, I can understand that now.

17:51.250 --> 17:53.343
There's something I really have to show you.

17:53.419 --> 17:55.979
You know the drawing you showed me last night?

17:56.055 --> 17:58.387
- Stop talking about it so loudly. - It's been bugging me...

17:58.457 --> 18:00.391
where I've seen something like it, so I came here...

18:00.459 --> 18:03.189
I looked around, and that's what I saw.

18:03.262 --> 18:05.662
It's this place. It's called Machu Picchu, right? It's in Peru.

18:05.731 --> 18:08.700
And it's full of stufflike this. I mean, exactly like in your drawing.

18:08.734 --> 18:11.430
Next you're gonna tell me that spacemen came here thousands of years ago...

18:11.537 --> 18:13.630
to share all their secrets with cavemen, right?

18:13.739 --> 18:16.333
Forget it, Alex. Don't you think we've checked all this stuff out?

18:16.442 --> 18:18.740
It's just some stupid rumor like those ridiculous crop circles...

18:18.811 --> 18:21.143
and the rest of the lies people tell to make a buck.

18:21.213 --> 18:25.240
- Just let it go, okay? - [Loudly] But what if this could help you find your planet?

18:25.317 --> 18:28.218
[People Murmuring]

18:28.287 --> 18:31.222
What did you just say?

18:31.290 --> 18:33.656
- [Laughs] - Evans's sister, right?

18:33.726 --> 18:35.660
Yeah.

18:35.728 --> 18:39.095
I don't appreciate your attempt at humor, young man.

18:39.165 --> 18:43.158
We UFOlogists don't joke about things like that.

18:43.235 --> 18:45.328
Yes, sir. Of course not. I apologize.

18:48.073 --> 18:50.041
Hmm.

18:51.343 --> 18:53.334
[Sighs] I'm sorry.

18:53.412 --> 18:56.745
Do you understand what a mistake like that would do in front of somebody who mattered?

18:56.816 --> 18:58.875
I'm sorry. I slipped. It won't happen again.

18:58.951 --> 19:02.409
- God, Alex. - [Crowd Gasps] - I'm sorry.

19:02.488 --> 19:05.116
- All right, let us through, please. - Excuse me.

19:05.191 --> 19:07.159
- We're in charge. - Max.

19:07.226 --> 19:11.162
- Get Max Evans. - I'm here. I'm here.

19:13.132 --> 19:15.532
Keep 'em closed.

19:15.601 --> 19:18.729
- Someone call an ambulance.! - No, no. I got him. I got him.

19:18.804 --> 19:21.034
[Milton] It's your friend. The one that broke in here.

19:21.106 --> 19:24.132
- What's going on, Evans? - Migraines. He gets really bad migraines.

19:24.210 --> 19:26.644
My God.

19:26.712 --> 19:29.545
- Oh, my God, Max. - Help me get him out of here, quick.

19:29.615 --> 19:31.810
- Michael. - Here, let me help.

19:31.884 --> 19:33.875
No. Just leave us alone.

19:38.290 --> 19:40.383
Okay, so once you're done with the sugars...

19:40.459 --> 19:43.292
will you just make sure the salt and pepper shakers are full too?

19:43.362 --> 19:47.230
- You are letting this whole manager thing get to your head. - [Knocking]

19:47.333 --> 19:49.597
Liz.

19:49.668 --> 19:52.034
Oh, Max, um, what are you doing?

19:52.104 --> 19:55.972
- We came through the back. We need your help. - Maria.

19:58.377 --> 20:02.108
- Michael. Is he okay? - [Isabel] Does he look okay to you?

20:02.181 --> 20:04.115
- What's wrong with him? - God, how should I know?

20:04.183 --> 20:05.673
Nothing like this has ever happened before.

20:05.751 --> 20:10.552
We need to keep him someplace safe. Liz, can we keep him here?

20:10.623 --> 20:13.490
Yeah, uh, but let's just take him upstairs.

20:13.559 --> 20:16.187
- It will be safer there. - We'll have to carry him.

20:17.263 --> 20:19.891
Yeah, I'll go first.

20:23.836 --> 20:26.100
It only goes up to 112.

20:26.171 --> 20:30.198
We're gonna need some ice and towels. We need to cool him down.

20:30.276 --> 20:35.908
Um, they're in the kitchen, and then there's some in the bathroom too.

20:38.584 --> 20:41.485
- Are you okay? - Has this ever happened before?

20:41.554 --> 20:45.217
- I mean, to you? - Never.

20:45.291 --> 20:48.556
[Chanting]

20:48.627 --> 20:51.619
- What's he saying? - I don't... I don't know.

20:51.664 --> 20:53.791
It's some kind of chant.

20:53.899 --> 20:55.890
- Michael, can you hear me? - [Chanting]

20:56.001 --> 20:58.731
What are you saying? What are you trying to tell us?

20:58.804 --> 21:01.238
Michael, it's me, Max.

21:01.340 --> 21:04.036
Please let me help you.

21:04.109 --> 21:08.773
[Exhales Sharply] River Dog.

21:08.847 --> 21:12.112
[Chanting Continues]

21:31.804 --> 21:33.738
You're not welcome here anymore.

21:33.806 --> 21:35.740
We just want to find out what happened.

21:35.808 --> 21:40.074
You told someone what you found here! River Dog is really angry.

21:40.145 --> 21:43.706
It is really important that we talk to him about what he did to Michael.

21:43.782 --> 21:46.842
He tested him. Your friend didn't pass.

21:46.919 --> 21:48.853
- What do you mean? - That's all I know.

21:48.921 --> 21:52.618
That's not enough. I want to know exactly what River Dog did to him.

21:52.691 --> 21:55.660
He wants nothing to do with you. You betrayed his trust...

21:55.728 --> 21:58.128
and that's something he won't forgive.

21:58.230 --> 22:01.461
I don't want forgiveness. I want answers before my friend dies.

22:01.567 --> 22:04.127
Look, Max. Max.

22:05.904 --> 22:08.065
Michael's really sick, Eddie...

22:08.140 --> 22:10.608
and we don't know what to do.

22:10.709 --> 22:12.973
We need River Dog.

22:14.580 --> 22:17.071
I'm sorry.

22:17.149 --> 22:19.083
But he's gone.

22:20.452 --> 22:22.579
I'm waiting here until he comes back.

22:31.263 --> 22:33.788
- What are you doing? - Well, he's so cold, l...

22:33.899 --> 22:37.630
Are you kidding? He's burning up.

22:37.736 --> 22:40.204
Right before I had the chicken pox, I had a really high fever...

22:40.272 --> 22:42.263
and my mom had to put me in an ice bath.

22:46.311 --> 22:50.247
- This isn't the chicken pox, and he was fine. - [Knocking]

22:50.315 --> 22:52.875
- Knock, knock. - I thought you said you locked the door.

22:52.951 --> 22:55.351
The key's always under the mat.

22:55.421 --> 22:57.651
Hey, look, everything's going fine downstairs.

22:57.723 --> 23:00.817
I just wanted to come up, see if there's anything that I could do.

23:00.893 --> 23:03.623
Yes, there's something you can do. You can get out of here, both of you!

23:03.696 --> 23:07.029
And let me take care of Michael. God, he needs me right now...

23:07.132 --> 23:09.066
not strangers.

23:11.937 --> 23:15.236
[Max] I remember the first time I saw Michael.

23:15.340 --> 23:17.274
It was in the desert...

23:17.342 --> 23:19.708
the night we first came out of the pods.

23:21.113 --> 23:24.913
The sky was bright with stars and this full moon.

23:24.983 --> 23:28.578
Isabel and I found each other first.

23:28.654 --> 23:31.851
We didn't know how to speak, but we could communicate anyway.

23:31.924 --> 23:33.983
We walked for a while...

23:34.059 --> 23:36.425
but we could both feel someone else.

23:36.495 --> 23:38.156
Michael.

23:39.431 --> 23:42.093
He said he saw us, but that he was afraid.

23:42.201 --> 23:45.693
So he just watched us for a long time. When he finally revealed himself...

23:45.804 --> 23:48.898
he was standing on this rock. [Chuckles]

23:49.007 --> 23:51.373
Just like you'd expect from Michael.

23:51.443 --> 23:53.809
- "Here I am. Deal with me." - [Laughs]

23:55.547 --> 23:58.516
He said it was the hardest thing he's ever had to do...

23:58.584 --> 24:00.950
to trust us.

24:01.019 --> 24:04.785
So, um, how did you guys end up getting separated?

24:04.857 --> 24:06.848
We all saw the headlights at the same time.

24:06.925 --> 24:10.827
Isabel took my hand.

24:10.896 --> 24:12.864
We knew we'd be safe as long as we stayed together.

24:12.965 --> 24:15.991
I held my hand out for Michael.

24:16.068 --> 24:19.265
I knew he wanted to, but...

24:19.371 --> 24:21.805
he just wouldn't take it.

24:21.874 --> 24:24.741
So we just looked at each other for a long time.

24:24.810 --> 24:27.005
Wouldn't see him again for three years.

24:28.747 --> 24:32.308
Isabel would cry every night, wondering where he was.

24:37.122 --> 24:40.250
You all right?

24:40.325 --> 24:42.293
Uh, yeah, it...

24:42.361 --> 24:44.329
it's just kinda sad, you know...

24:44.396 --> 24:47.297
thinking of being separated like that.

24:48.801 --> 24:51.269
You're wondering if it could happen to me, aren't you?

24:51.370 --> 24:55.636
- If I could get sick like Michael. - No. Mm-mmm.

24:55.707 --> 24:57.641
I've been thinking about it a lot too.

24:57.709 --> 25:00.644
Whether this is just our life cycle.

25:00.712 --> 25:03.772
And then maybe this is how we die.

25:05.717 --> 25:08.049
Max, it's... Come on, it's not.

25:08.120 --> 25:10.247
I can understand if you have doubts...

25:10.322 --> 25:12.313
about us.

25:14.126 --> 25:17.254
I mean, second thoughts.

25:17.362 --> 25:21.162
Because committing to someone is hard enough without having to wonder if...

25:22.334 --> 25:24.302
they're even gonna be here tomorrow.

25:39.885 --> 25:42.649
Hey. You should eat.

25:45.224 --> 25:48.091
Um... [Chuckles]... I didn't know how much you like, so...

25:49.194 --> 25:51.662
Thank you.

25:58.237 --> 26:00.432
I care about him too, you know.

26:00.539 --> 26:03.201
I know you do.

26:06.078 --> 26:09.411
But Max and Michael are all I have.

26:09.481 --> 26:12.882
- And if I lose them... - You won't.

26:12.951 --> 26:15.181
[Gasping]

26:15.254 --> 26:17.814
- What's happening? - I don't know.

26:17.890 --> 26:20.859
I don't know! But he's strong... he'll hurt himself.

26:20.926 --> 26:23.053
Go get Alex.

26:23.128 --> 26:25.062
Michael!

26:25.163 --> 26:28.064
- [Line Ringing] - They're not answering.

26:28.133 --> 26:31.193
- [Drums Beating] - We should get back.

26:31.303 --> 26:35.171
[Man Chanting]

26:35.240 --> 26:37.640
That's what Michael's been saying over and over.

26:37.709 --> 26:39.734
It's coming from that tent.

26:41.647 --> 26:43.911
[Drums, Chanting Continue]

26:45.417 --> 26:47.578
[Chanting]

26:49.755 --> 26:53.555
Let's give him more water. That helped him before.

26:53.625 --> 26:55.889
[Chanting Continues]

27:00.365 --> 27:02.526
[Gagging]

27:44.142 --> 27:47.543
[Chanting]

27:48.547 --> 27:51.482
[Chanting, Drumming]

28:00.292 --> 28:02.192
[Liz] What are they doing?

28:02.260 --> 28:05.058
I'm not sure.

28:05.130 --> 28:07.428
I mean, what's happening to Michael isn't natural at all.

28:09.935 --> 28:13.632
Bring him here. We might not have much time.

28:26.518 --> 28:28.452
Thank God you're here.

28:30.455 --> 28:32.685
Oh, my God, Max.

28:36.228 --> 28:39.425
This is really happening, isn't it?

28:58.016 --> 29:01.213
[River Dog] The man who lived in this cave when I was a boy was not like us.

29:01.286 --> 29:05.552
Some of the elders believed he was an evil spirit, so they decided to test him.

29:05.624 --> 29:09.890
He was invited into the sweat, just like I invited your friend.

29:09.961 --> 29:12.452
His reaction was quick and severe.

29:12.531 --> 29:17.127
Within a minute, his eyes were white, and he developed a fever.

29:17.202 --> 29:20.171
Just like Michael.

29:20.205 --> 29:23.333
Only it took the symptoms longer to show up in your friend.

29:23.442 --> 29:25.433
That's why I dismissed him at first.

29:25.510 --> 29:27.808
But when you told me he was sick...

29:27.879 --> 29:30.006
I knew he was another visitor.

29:30.082 --> 29:32.209
That's an interesting way to put it.

29:32.284 --> 29:34.946
Well, that's what he called himself.

29:35.020 --> 29:37.147
In my language, the word is nasedo.

29:37.222 --> 29:39.281
So that's what I called him.

29:39.357 --> 29:41.222
And you knew Nasedo well?

29:41.293 --> 29:43.853
I saved his life.

29:43.929 --> 29:46.454
After the sweat, he ran out into the desert.

29:46.565 --> 29:48.863
And we were told not to follow him.

29:48.967 --> 29:51.697
But I was a boy, and I didn't listen.

29:51.803 --> 29:54.966
I found him in this cave, dying.

29:55.073 --> 29:57.541
He had to trust me with his secret...

29:57.609 --> 30:00.237
so that I could heal him.

30:00.345 --> 30:03.143
- And you'll do the same to heal Michael. - I'll try.

30:03.215 --> 30:05.274
But I'll need the help of all of you.

30:05.350 --> 30:08.786
- Even me? - Healing requires energy.

30:08.854 --> 30:11.982
The more we have, the faster we heal.

30:13.458 --> 30:17.189
Now everyone take your place in the circle.

30:17.262 --> 30:20.254
There's a line for each of you leading to the center.

30:59.304 --> 31:01.238
[River Dog] Nasedo gave me these stones.

31:03.175 --> 31:05.973
They're from his place.

31:06.044 --> 31:09.275
And they carry an energy inside them.

31:09.347 --> 31:12.942
- You mean, these are from... - Wherever you are from.

31:13.018 --> 31:17.079
He said that his body carried the same energy that's in these stones.

31:17.155 --> 31:19.589
He called it "the balance".

31:19.658 --> 31:24.925
He said that the heat from the sweat disrupted it in some way.

31:24.996 --> 31:26.987
How?

31:27.098 --> 31:31.330
He told me to hold the stones until my energy activated them.

31:31.436 --> 31:34.530
And the balance would be restored.

31:34.639 --> 31:37.609
- And if you didn't? - He would die.

31:41.746 --> 31:43.714
So let's get going.

31:43.815 --> 31:46.215
He warned me, though, there was a risk.

31:46.284 --> 31:48.809
The balance can pull you in.

31:48.887 --> 31:52.379
It's a force that can change both your body and your mind...

31:52.457 --> 31:54.721
unless you navigate it properly.

31:54.793 --> 31:57.523
Now, clear your mind.

31:57.596 --> 31:59.530
Drink from the bowl.

32:01.466 --> 32:04.128
Don't change the way you feel about your friend...

32:04.202 --> 32:06.170
and you'll come out on the right side.

32:06.238 --> 32:09.036
- What is it? - Water.

32:09.107 --> 32:12.338
Something in common with all of us.

32:12.444 --> 32:16.380
By drinking from the same bowl, we begin the connection.

32:41.740 --> 32:46.404
You're afraid. Not of the healing.

32:46.511 --> 32:50.447
Your fear runs deeper. You fear for someone else...

32:50.548 --> 32:53.381
someone you care for a great deal.

32:54.986 --> 32:57.284
You must take a step back.

32:57.355 --> 32:59.346
You cannot stop the flow.

33:03.261 --> 33:05.559
I'm sorry.

33:14.472 --> 33:17.999
[Chanting]

33:22.781 --> 33:26.478
[All Chanting]

33:27.552 --> 33:30.988
She'll find her own path.

33:31.056 --> 33:34.321
- You take yours. - [Chanting Continues]

33:48.306 --> 33:50.968
[Chanting Continues]

35:13.725 --> 35:16.558
[Cocoon Tearing]

35:46.591 --> 35:48.525
You all right?

35:51.596 --> 35:53.757
I went someplace, Max...

35:53.832 --> 35:57.928
- and I saw things. - But you came back...

35:58.002 --> 36:01.233
- for good this time. - Yeah, I came back.

36:10.682 --> 36:14.482
Thank you, Maxwell. No more running.

36:16.020 --> 36:19.012
No matter what.

36:19.090 --> 36:22.719
Give me your rocks.

37:09.140 --> 37:12.109
It's a map.

37:28.993 --> 37:32.929
[Thinking] I've always been the one who comes through in the time of crisis.

37:32.997 --> 37:35.989
I do what's necessary, and I don't panic.

37:36.067 --> 37:38.729
But seeing Michael so sick...

37:38.803 --> 37:42.239
and having no way of knowing what was wrong or how to help...

37:42.307 --> 37:45.333
It made me scared...

37:45.443 --> 37:47.877
scared that one day something could happen to Max...

37:47.946 --> 37:52.007
and I wouldn't know how to help this person who means so much to me...

37:52.116 --> 37:56.075
- who means everything. - Is this a bad time?

37:57.288 --> 38:00.052
No, it's not.

38:04.162 --> 38:06.960
Hi.

38:07.031 --> 38:10.899
- Just, uh... I wanted to see how you were doing. - I'm fine.

38:10.969 --> 38:13.335
Yeah, um...

38:13.404 --> 38:17.465
- how's Michael? - Same as ever.

38:17.542 --> 38:19.840
That's... That's really good.

38:21.846 --> 38:24.440
But I'm not, Liz.

38:24.515 --> 38:26.483
What do you mean?

38:26.551 --> 38:30.043
I mean, one day it will be me, and I can't keep pretending...

38:30.121 --> 38:33.648
that I'm... normal.

38:34.692 --> 38:36.887
Max, look.

38:36.961 --> 38:39.429
You know, I didn't... I didn't mean to have doubts.

38:39.497 --> 38:42.830
I didn't... I didn't mean to let you down in the cave.

38:42.900 --> 38:45.698
I don't blame you. You had every right to feel that way...

38:45.770 --> 38:47.704
because what you felt is true.

38:50.942 --> 38:53.672
We don't belong together.

38:56.014 --> 38:58.847
Don't say that.

39:00.218 --> 39:03.016
The other night, you know, when we went out...

39:03.087 --> 39:05.248
and the whole day before...

39:07.125 --> 39:09.923
ever since we kissed...

39:09.994 --> 39:12.656
I've been off balance.

39:12.730 --> 39:15.699
You made me forget that anything else existed.

39:16.934 --> 39:18.868
But that's not real.

39:20.471 --> 39:23.872
It is the only real thing that I've ever felt.

39:27.211 --> 39:31.841
Sometimes you have to take a step back to see what's really going on.

39:33.484 --> 39:36.112
Maybe that's what we both really need to do right now...

39:38.356 --> 39:40.517
find our balance again.

39:41.592 --> 39:43.958
You know, Max, I thought that, uh...

39:44.028 --> 39:46.019
I thought that we'd found it.

39:48.066 --> 39:51.058
You don't know how much I wish that could be true.

39:51.135 --> 39:54.627
Max...

39:54.706 --> 39:57.834
how is it possible that I could be...

39:57.942 --> 40:00.877
[Chuckles] I could be the happiest that I've ever been...

40:00.978 --> 40:03.446
in my entire life...

40:03.548 --> 40:07.575
you know, and now the saddest all at...

40:07.685 --> 40:09.846
all at one time?

40:11.289 --> 40:13.985
I think that's what being in love is.

40:15.059 --> 40:18.119
Yeah, I think so too.

40:22.734 --> 40:25.396
So we'll just take a step back...

40:25.470 --> 40:27.563
for a while.

40:27.638 --> 40:30.004
[Sighs] Well, uh...

40:30.108 --> 40:32.508
you know, if that's what...

40:32.610 --> 40:36.102
- if that's what you want, l... - That's what I need.

40:37.281 --> 40:40.216
'Cause I'm just as scared as you are.

40:44.188 --> 40:46.418
No, wait, Max.

40:53.831 --> 40:55.890
#[Woman Singing]

40:58.970 --> 41:01.939
I just wanted... to remember.

41:06.944 --> 41:09.674
Good-bye, Liz.

41:09.747 --> 41:12.648
Good-bye, Max.
