HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

00:18.833 --> 00:20.367

00:20.400 --> 00:22.200
THAT'S PERSONAL.

00:22.233 --> 00:23.900
YEAH. YEAH, I KNOW
WHAT YOU WISHED FOR.

00:23.933 --> 00:26.533
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WISHED FOR--
IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

00:26.567 --> 00:29.033
- OH, I KNOW.

00:29.067 --> 00:29.967

00:30.000 --> 00:31.667

YOU KNOW,
IT'S A PERSONAL THING.
IT'S A WISH.

00:34.100 --> 00:36.133
- YOU WISHED--
- I DON'T LIKE TO SAY
WHAT I WISHED FOR.

00:36.167 --> 00:38.200
YOU WISHED THAT
LOUIS LEWIS WOULD DIE,

00:38.233 --> 00:40.800
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO GIVE UP
YOUR OWN KIDNEY TO RICHARD.

00:40.833 --> 00:42.533
YEAH, RIGHT.

00:42.567 --> 00:44.000

- YEAH.

00:44.033 --> 00:46.000
- NO, IT WASN'T.
- YEAH, TRUST ME. OH YES.

00:46.033 --> 00:47.700
WHO WOULD DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

00:47.733 --> 00:50.100
YOU! YOU,
THAT'S WHO-- YOU!

00:50.133 --> 00:52.600
YOU THINK I WOULD WISH
FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S IN A COMA,

00:52.633 --> 00:54.867
WHO'S PRACTICALLY
A VEGETABLE, TO DIE,

00:54.900 --> 00:57.633
JUST SO I WOULDN'T HAVE
TO GIVE UP MY OWN KIDNEY?

01:00.300 --> 01:01.767
OKAY.

01:01.800 --> 01:04.800
LET'S GO.
OPEN HER UP.

01:04.833 --> 01:06.733

01:08.933 --> 01:10.467

01:12.500 --> 01:14.967
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE A BIG FRIEND,
YOU CAN SMACK HIM AROUND.
LOOK AT THAT!

01:15.067 --> 01:16.633
- IT DOESN'T HURT.
- DON'T FEEL A THING.

01:16.667 --> 01:18.833
- DOESN'T HURT HIM,
DOESN'T FEEL ANYTHING.
- DON'T FEEL A THING.

01:18.867 --> 01:20.633
TAKE A POP AT HIM.
GO AHEAD, TAKE A POP.

01:20.667 --> 01:22.467
TAKE A POP.
DOESN'T FEEL ANYTHING.

01:25.067 --> 01:27.200

01:27.233 --> 01:29.067
- I GOT IT.
- COME ON. I WRAPPED IT.

01:29.067 --> 01:30.967
- I KNOW HOW TO DO IT.
- DOESN'T MATTER.
IT'S MY GIFT!

01:31.067 --> 01:33.667
- IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.
- IT'S MY PRESENT. LET GO.

01:33.700 --> 01:35.600
- LET OF THE PACKAGE.

01:43.267 --> 01:45.233
IT'S A GREEN--
IT'S A GREEN SPORT JACKET.

01:45.267 --> 01:47.367
HE HAS ONE AND I
COMPLIMENTED HIM ON IT.

01:47.400 --> 01:50.833
AND HE REMEMBERED WHAT I SAID
AND HE GOT ME THIS.

01:50.867 --> 01:53.067
THIS IS THE BEST
BIRTHDAY I EVER HAD.

01:53.067 --> 01:54.633
BEST BIRTHDAY A FELLOW
COULD EVER HAVE.

01:56.200 --> 01:59.633
I NOTICED THAT YOU HAVEN'T
CONTRIBUTED ANYTHING TO--

01:59.667 --> 02:02.967
I KNOW, MY GIFT
IS ON HOLD.

02:03.067 --> 02:06.067
I HAVE TO CONFIRM
SOMETHING BEFORE
I GIVE IT TO YOU.

02:06.067 --> 02:07.133
REALLY?

02:07.167 --> 02:09.067
NO, IT'S GONNA BE SO GOOD.
IT'S GONNA BE SO GOOD.

02:09.067 --> 02:10.400
WHEN AM I GOING
TO GET IT?

02:10.433 --> 02:13.267

OH, YOU KIDDIN'?

02:41.333 --> 02:43.300
HE'S-- YOU KNOW,
HE'S ALL RIGHT.

02:43.333 --> 02:46.733
THE HEARING IS GOING
AND THE MIND IS,
YOU KNOW, IT'S--

02:46.767 --> 02:49.833
THIS IS TRAGIC.
BECAUSE THIS GUY,
HE WAS SHARP.

02:49.867 --> 02:52.133
YEAH, BUT HE'S NOT--
HE FORGETS THINGS,

02:52.167 --> 02:54.767
HE DOESN'T REMEMBER
STUFF ANYMORE.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.767
WELL, AT LEAST
IT'S NOT HIS HIP.

02:56.800 --> 03:00.233
BECAUSE ONCE IT'S
IN THE HIP, THEN YOU'RE GONE.
THEY ALL SAY YOU'RE GONE.

03:00.267 --> 03:02.067
- LOOK WHO'S HERE.
- HI, ANDY. HOW ARE YOU, PAL?

03:02.067 --> 03:04.100

03:19.833 --> 03:21.733
THERE'S NO WAY.

03:21.767 --> 03:23.333
OH, COME ON.

03:27.300 --> 03:30.233
I GOT TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.
PARDON ME A SEC.

03:30.267 --> 03:31.967
OH, HEY, LET ME
ASK YOU SOMETHING.

03:32.067 --> 03:34.700
DID...

03:34.733 --> 03:36.667
DID YOUR PARENTS EVER
MENTION ANYTHING TO YOU

03:36.700 --> 03:39.267
ABOUT ME BEING--
ADOPTED?

03:39.300 --> 03:41.267
WHAT?

03:41.300 --> 03:43.533
- WHEN MY FATHER WAS LYING
ON THE HOSPITAL BED...
- YEAH?

03:45.300 --> 03:47.800
( toilet flushes )

03:47.833 --> 03:49.067
I'VE NEVER HEARD
ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

03:49.100 --> 03:51.433
NAT NEVER SAID
ANYTHING TO ME,
TO MY MOM,

03:51.467 --> 03:53.100
- NOTHING.
- PARENTS NEVER SAID
ANYTHING?

03:53.133 --> 03:54.833
NOTHING.
THIS IS WILD.

03:54.867 --> 03:56.933
- I HIRED A PRIVATE
INVESTIGATOR.
- NO, YOU DIDN'T.

03:56.967 --> 03:59.433
- YEAH, I SHOULD HEAR
SOMETHING PRETTY SOON.
- NO. YOU KNOW WHAT, LARRY?

03:59.467 --> 04:02.100
YOU'RE NUTS.
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND.

04:02.133 --> 04:05.167
JUST LEAVE IT ALONE.
I'M GOING TO GO SAY HEY
TO CHERYL.

04:32.067 --> 04:34.700
OH, GOOD AFTERNOON.

04:34.733 --> 04:36.133
- Larry: HELLO.
- HELLO.

04:36.167 --> 04:37.600
CAN I HELP YOU?

04:40.433 --> 04:42.467
I'M A FRIEND
OF HIS COUSIN.

04:42.500 --> 04:44.567
RICHARD LEWIS?

04:44.600 --> 04:46.533
OH, YES, YES.
MR. LEWIS. YES.
RIGHT, YEAH.

04:48.233 --> 04:50.067
YES, THAT'S TOO BAD.
IT'S TOO BAD.

04:50.100 --> 04:51.467
HOW'S HE DOING?

04:51.500 --> 04:54.067
WELL, UNFORTUNATELY
HE'S NOT DOING TOO WELL.

04:54.067 --> 04:57.333
HE'S IN
AN IRREVERSIBLE COMA.

04:57.367 --> 05:01.967
- AS YOU CAN SEE WE GOT HIM
SET UP ON LIFE SUPPORT.
- I SEE, YEAH.

05:02.067 --> 05:04.167
PROGNOSIS ISN'T GOOD.
SO--

05:04.200 --> 05:06.700
- HUH.
- YEAH.

05:06.733 --> 05:09.167
SO...

05:09.200 --> 05:11.200
HOW LONG DO YOU
THINK HE HAS?

05:11.233 --> 05:13.333
- I BEG YOUR PARDON?
- HOW LONG DO YOU THINK HE HAS?

05:13.367 --> 05:17.400
IT'S HARD TO SAY.
IT COULD BE DAYS,
WEEKS, MONTHS.

05:17.433 --> 05:21.267
THERE'S BEEN CASES
WHERE PATIENTS HAVE BEEN
IN COMAS FOR YEARS.

05:21.300 --> 05:24.333
- OH, REALLY?
- YEAH, YEAH.

05:24.367 --> 05:28.533
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE LEANING
MORE TOWARDS...

05:28.567 --> 05:30.633
WEEKS OR MONTHS?

05:30.667 --> 05:33.133
IT'S HARD TO SAY.

05:33.167 --> 05:35.300
IF YOU HAD
TO PICK ONE.

05:35.333 --> 05:37.733
I DON'T KNOW
IF I COULD PICK ONE.

05:37.767 --> 05:39.633
TAKE A SHOT.

05:39.667 --> 05:41.467
NO.

05:41.500 --> 05:43.800
WELL...

05:48.800 --> 05:51.333
Larry:
WHAT HAPPENS
TO THE MOUSTACHE IN A COMA?

05:51.367 --> 05:53.700
- THE MOUSTACHE?
- YEAH, HIS MOUSTACHE.

05:53.733 --> 05:56.900
IT CONTINUES TO GROW.
THERE'S A LADY WHO COMES IN
A COUPLE TIMES.

05:56.933 --> 05:59.467
REALLY?
THE HOSPITAL
HAS A BARBER?

05:59.500 --> 06:01.067
YEAH.
SHE'S A NICE LADY.

06:01.067 --> 06:02.800
SHE CLIPS HIS MOUSTACHE,
SHE DOES HIS HAIR.

06:02.833 --> 06:05.867
- SHE JUST WORKS WITHIN
THE HOSPITAL OR--
- WITHIN THE HOSPITAL, YES.

06:05.900 --> 06:07.800
WE JUST TRY
AND KEEP HIM
COMFORTABLE,

06:07.833 --> 06:10.767
AND...
YOU KNOW...

06:10.800 --> 06:13.667
SEEMS A PITY
THOUGH, THAT--

06:13.700 --> 06:15.833
THESE PEOPLE
LANGUISH LIKE THIS

06:15.867 --> 06:18.300
WHEN THE SOUL
IS CRYING TO--

06:18.333 --> 06:20.667
YEAH, I GUESS YOU COULD
LOOK AT IT THAT WAY.

06:20.700 --> 06:24.067
HE'S GOT ALL THESE ORGANS
HE COULD BE DONATING.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

06:26.433 --> 06:28.900
YEAH. I SUPPOSE.

06:28.933 --> 06:30.500
- PEOPLE THEY SIT HERE
WITH THEIR ORGANS AND--
- NICE TALKING TO YOU.

06:30.533 --> 06:33.500
PEOPLE WHO ARE ALIVE
THEY NEED THE--

06:43.133 --> 06:45.167
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

06:46.500 --> 06:48.067
WHAT?

06:48.067 --> 06:50.600
YOU PULL THAT PLUG
AND I'LL TELL.

06:50.633 --> 06:53.300
NO, IT FELL.
IT FELL ON THE FLOOR.
I'M PICKING IT UP.

06:53.333 --> 06:55.467
- OH.
- PULLING PLUGS.
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT FROM?

06:55.500 --> 06:58.667
WELL, YOU JUST
LOOKED LIKE YOU WERE
ABOUT TO PULL THE PLUG.

06:58.700 --> 07:00.667
YOU HAD YOUR HANDS ON IT,
YOU WERE KIND OF--

07:00.700 --> 07:02.433
ABOUT TO PULL THE PLUG?
ARE YOU CRAZY?

07:02.467 --> 07:04.633
I HEARD
YOUR CONVERSATION.

07:04.667 --> 07:06.667
SO, WHAT?
YOU WANT THIS GUY
DEAD OR SOMETHING?

07:06.700 --> 07:08.767
LISTEN, THAT'S A VERY
SERIOUS THING YOU'RE SAYING.

07:08.800 --> 07:10.767
YOU'RE PRACTICALLY
CALLING ME A MURDERER.

07:10.800 --> 07:13.667
I'M NOT PULLING ANY PLUG.
SO, COME ON. ENOUGH OF THAT.

07:13.700 --> 07:17.067
OKAY.
I'M WILLING TO OVERLOOK
THIS WHOLE THING.

07:17.067 --> 07:19.433
ARE YOU? BOY.
THAT'S VERY NICE OF YOU,
THANK YOU.

07:19.467 --> 07:20.567
- I APPRECIATE THAT.
- IF--

07:20.600 --> 07:22.867
- YEAH?
- YOU GRANT MY WISH

07:22.900 --> 07:24.733
THAT THE MAKE-A-WISH
FOUNDATION TURNED DOWN.

07:24.767 --> 07:28.067
- YOU'LL FORGET ABOUT THIS?
- YOU AGREE?

07:28.067 --> 07:31.933
WHAT WAS THIS WISH
THAT THEY WOULDN'T GRANT?

07:33.433 --> 07:35.700
I WANT TO SEE
A NAKED WOMAN.

07:37.533 --> 07:39.267
- YOU WANT TO SEE
A NAKED WOMAN?
- UM-HMM.

07:39.300 --> 07:41.233
- THAT'S YOUR WISH?
- UM-HMM.

07:41.267 --> 07:43.800
- THEY WOULDN'T
GRANT THAT WISH?
- OF COURSE NOT.

07:43.833 --> 07:47.100
IMAGINE GOING
THROUGH YOUR WHOLE LIFE
WITHOUT SEEING A NAKED WOMAN.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.433
- HEY, I ALMOST DID.
- HMM...

07:49.467 --> 07:52.500
SO YOU'RE GOING
TO GRANT MY WISH?

07:52.533 --> 07:56.833
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I WOULD LOVE TO HELP YOU OUT.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

07:56.867 --> 07:58.133
WILSON.

07:58.167 --> 08:00.433
I'D LIKE TO HELP YOU OUT,
WILSON, I REALLY WOULD,

08:00.467 --> 08:04.867
BUT I DON'T KNOW
ANY NAKED WOMEN. MY WIFE,
THAT'S THE ONLY ONE I KNOW.

08:04.900 --> 08:05.833
- SHE'S PERFECT.
- SHE'S NOT GOING TO DO THIS.

08:05.867 --> 08:07.233
WHY NOT?

08:07.267 --> 08:10.200
SHE'S NOT GOING TO COME
AND TAKE HER CLOTHES OFF
FOR YOU.

08:10.233 --> 08:11.900
TAKE ME TO YOUR PLACE.

08:11.933 --> 08:14.700
FORGET IT.
I WOULD HAVE TO COME UP
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.

08:14.733 --> 08:16.367
FINE.
THAT'S YOUR JOB.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.300
- I'LL THINK ABOUT IT. OKAY?
- YOU'LL THINK ABOUT IT?

08:18.333 --> 08:19.967
- YEAH.
- YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

08:20.067 --> 08:22.200
EVEN IF I HAD SOMEONE,
HOW ARE YOU GONNA GET
OUT OF HERE ANYWAY?

08:22.233 --> 08:24.267
OH, PLEASE,
I SNEAK OUT ALL THE TIME.

08:24.300 --> 08:26.267
HAVE A NICE DAY.

08:34.967 --> 08:37.367
OH, ANDY.

08:37.400 --> 08:39.267
THIS PACKAGE
IS FOR YOU.

08:39.300 --> 08:41.300
OPEN IT UP.
WHAT IS IT?

08:41.333 --> 08:44.067
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S FROM NAT.

08:44.067 --> 08:47.133
- Andy: OH, IT'S
FROM YOUR FATHER.
- Cheryl: YEAH.

08:47.167 --> 08:48.600
LOOK AT THAT.

08:48.633 --> 08:51.600
HE SENT ME
HIS SMOKING JACKET.

08:51.633 --> 08:55.333
- Cheryl: WOW.
- WOW. HOW LOVELY.

08:55.367 --> 08:59.467
- LOOK AT THAT.
- WHY WOULD HE SEND THIS
TO ME? BUT IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

08:59.500 --> 09:02.233
- WOW.
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

09:02.267 --> 09:06.100
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?
I'M SORRY TO TELL YOU THIS.

09:06.133 --> 09:09.767
THIS IS PROBABLY
A BIRTHDAY GIFT FOR ME.

09:09.800 --> 09:12.533
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.
'CAUSE WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER,

09:12.567 --> 09:14.133
WHENEVER IT WAS
MY BIRTHDAY

09:14.167 --> 09:17.733
MY FATHER WOULD
ALWAYS SEND A GIFT TO HIM
SO HE WOULDN'T FEEL LEFT OUT.

09:17.767 --> 09:21.233
SO, HE KIND OF GOT CONFUSED,
YOU KNOW, HE'S NOT--

09:21.267 --> 09:22.900
HE'S NOT THE SAME
AS HE WAS.

09:22.933 --> 09:26.133
HE KIND OF GOT CONFUSED
AND HE MUST HAVE WRITTEN
YOUR NAME ON IT.

09:26.167 --> 09:28.333
YOU THINK THAT
HE DID NOT SEND
THIS TO ME?

09:28.367 --> 09:30.200
- WHY WOULD HE
SEND IT TO YOU?
- LOOK AT THIS--

09:30.233 --> 09:32.733
"ANDY DAVID."
LOOK UP AT THE TOP,
IN THE RETURN IS "NAT."

09:32.767 --> 09:36.967
ANDY, HE DIDN'T SEND ME
ANYTHING FOR MY BIRTHDAY.
HE ALWAYS SENDS--

09:37.067 --> 09:38.567
YOU CAN'T ACCEPT
THE FACT THAT HE
SENT ME A GIFT.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.667
HE PROMISED ME
THIS JACKET.

09:40.700 --> 09:42.367
- WHO DID?
- MY FATHER.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.633
OH, LARRY,
YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE.

09:44.667 --> 09:47.067
YOU CAN'T ACCEPT THE FACT
THAT YOUR FATHER SENT ME
A LOVELY GIFT.

09:47.067 --> 09:49.133
HE HAS NO REASON
TO SEND IT TO YOU.
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY.

09:49.167 --> 09:52.367
- BECAUSE HE HAPPENS TO LOVE ME.
- HE'S CONFUSED!

09:52.400 --> 09:56.100
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU.
HAVE YOU SEEN THAT "US"
MAGAZINE?

09:56.133 --> 09:57.867
I HAD
AN "US" MAGAZINE
THAT WAS--

09:57.900 --> 10:00.333
IT WAS IN
THE OTHER ROOM, IT--

10:00.367 --> 10:04.867
OH. I THINK
I THREW THAT OUT.

10:04.900 --> 10:08.833
WHAT?
OH MY GOD.

10:08.867 --> 10:11.433
- WHAT?
- I HAD A PHONE NUMBER.

10:11.467 --> 10:13.967
- A VERY IMPORTANT NUMBER
WRITTEN ON THAT MAGAZINE.
- WHAT PHONE NUMBER?

10:14.000 --> 10:15.767
WHY DID YOU THROW AWAY
MY MAGAZINE?

10:15.800 --> 10:18.167
BECAUSE HE TOOK IT
IN THE BATHROOM
AND CONTAMINATED IT.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.933
- OH...
- WHAT?

10:19.967 --> 10:23.100
- I WHAT?
- LARRY--

10:23.133 --> 10:25.933
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S
GET SERIOUS NOW, OKAY?
- WHAT?

10:25.967 --> 10:28.400
MY FATHER SENT
THAT JACKET FOR ME.
THAT'S A MISTAKE.

10:28.433 --> 10:29.967
MY FATHER WOULD NOT
JUST SEND YOU HIS JACKET.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.300
- HE SENT ME A JACKET.
- HE PROMISED ME THAT JACKET.

10:32.333 --> 10:33.967
HE GAVE IT TO ME
BECAUSE HE LIKES ME.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.100
IT'S A MISTAKE.
YOU'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE
OF AN OLD MAN.

10:36.133 --> 10:39.867
- YOU'RE LIKE A LITTLE BRAT--
- I'M A BRAT?
YOU FUCKING MORON!

10:39.900 --> 10:43.000
- GIVE ME THAT JACKET.
- NO, THIS IS MY JACKET.

10:43.033 --> 10:45.467
Andy:
THIS IS MY JACKET!
IT'S MINE!

10:48.067 --> 10:51.300
YOU KNOW HE PROMISED
THAT JACKET TO ME.

10:51.333 --> 10:53.333
IT'S UNFAIR.
HE DIDN'T GIVE ME
A BIRTHDAY PRESENT.

10:53.367 --> 10:55.733
HE'S JUST CONFUSED.
IT'S SO OBVIOUS.

10:55.767 --> 10:58.133
IT'S A BIG BOWL
OF WRONG.

10:58.167 --> 10:59.833
( mutters )
ANDY.

10:59.867 --> 11:03.933
SO, ARE YOU GOING
TO THE PLAYBOY MANSION?

11:03.967 --> 11:07.600
I CAN'T GO, I'M SO DEEP
IN THE DOGHOUSE NOW.

11:07.633 --> 11:10.567
SHE'S REALLY PISSED OFF
AT ME BECAUSE I THREW AWAY
HER MAGAZINE

11:10.600 --> 11:11.767
THAT HAD
A PHONE NUMBER ON IT.

11:11.800 --> 11:14.600
AW, COME ON MAN.
YOU'RE ALREADY IN
THE DOGHOUSE,

11:14.633 --> 11:16.267
YOU CAN'T GET
IN ANY MORE TROUBLE,

11:16.300 --> 11:18.067
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
GET YOUR MONEY'S WORTH.

11:18.067 --> 11:21.467
YEAH, MIGHT AS WELL
DO SOMETHING ELSE WRONG.

11:21.500 --> 11:23.567
IT'S A "DOUBLE
TRANSGRESSION"
THEORY.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.067
- WHAT AN INTERESTING THEORY.
- WELL, THANK YOU.

11:26.067 --> 11:27.767
"DOUBLE TRANSGRESSION
THEORY."

11:27.800 --> 11:30.733
AND I COULD ASK THAT KID
WILSON, TO GO WITH ME.

11:30.767 --> 11:32.300
WHO'S WILSON?

11:32.333 --> 11:34.800
OH, YEAH, WILSON.
I MET THIS KID
IN THE HOSPITAL...

11:40.600 --> 11:43.100
( male voice
speaking softly )

11:50.467 --> 11:52.733
THEY'LL TAKE LESS.

11:52.767 --> 11:56.333
TRUST ME. TRUST ME,
THEY'LL TAKE LESS.

11:56.367 --> 11:58.567
CALL ME BACK
WHEN YOU HEAR
FROM THEM.

11:58.600 --> 12:02.300
THAT'LL BE FINE.
I'M ON L.A. TIME, OKAY?

12:02.333 --> 12:04.133
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

12:04.167 --> 12:05.800
WHAT?

12:05.833 --> 12:08.667
WHAT IS THIS? HUH?

12:08.700 --> 12:11.233
TAKE THIS OFF.
THIS DOESN'T BELONG TO YOU,

12:11.267 --> 12:12.933
YOU KNOW IT
AND I KNOW IT.

12:12.967 --> 12:17.067
MY FATHER PROMISED ME
THIS SMOKING JACKET
WHEN I WAS 14 YEARS OLD.

12:17.067 --> 12:19.800
- LARRY, MOVE ON. MOVE ON...
- ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:19.833 --> 12:22.167
- OH MY GOODNESS.
- I'M GOING TO THE PLAYBOY
MANSION NOW, ALL RIGHT?

12:22.200 --> 12:24.533
WHEN I GET BACK,
I WANT YOU OUT OF
THAT JACKET.

12:24.567 --> 12:25.900
YOU'RE GOING TO
THE PLAYBOY MANSION?

12:25.933 --> 12:26.933
I DON'T WANT YOU
WALKING AROUND IN THIS
JACKET ANYMORE.

12:26.967 --> 12:30.733
HOLD ON. WAIT--
LARRY... TAKE ME.

12:30.767 --> 12:33.767
I WANT TO GO.
CAN I GO?

12:33.800 --> 12:35.467
- REALLY?
- PLEASE.

12:35.500 --> 12:37.733
OH, WHAT WOULD THIS
DO TO MY TRIP?

12:37.767 --> 12:40.067
- TO GO TO THE PLAYBOY MANSION!
- THAT WOULD BE GREAT,
WOULDN'T IT?

12:40.067 --> 12:42.067
- PLEASE.
- IT'S NOT REALLY
MY DECISION.

12:42.067 --> 12:44.767
- IT WOULD MAKE
MY TRIP SO BEAUTIFUL.
- I KNOW, ANDY.

12:44.800 --> 12:47.500
I WISH I COULD HELP YOU.
I REALLY DO. I WISH I COULD.

12:47.533 --> 12:49.600
- YOU CAN HELP ME.
JUST ASK JEFF.
- I DON'T KNOW...

12:49.633 --> 12:51.767
WHAT'S ONE GUY,
WHAT'S TWO GUYS?

12:52.933 --> 12:55.200
- OH, I GOT AN IDEA.
- WHAT?

12:55.233 --> 12:57.700
- YOU WANT TO GO
TO THE PLAYBOY MANSION?
- YEAH.

12:57.733 --> 13:00.800
YOU REALLY WANT TO GO?
GIVE ME THE JACKET.

13:02.367 --> 13:04.433
YOU GOT IT.
I'M GOING TO GO UP
AND CHANGE.

13:04.467 --> 13:07.100
WAIT A SECOND.
I'M TAKING IT TO
THE DRYCLEANER.

13:07.133 --> 13:08.900
- TAKE IT OFF.
- HERE, HERE, HERE.

13:18.533 --> 13:21.100
Man on intercom:
Speak into the rock.

13:23.200 --> 13:24.800
What's your business,
please?

13:24.833 --> 13:29.467
JEFF GREENE
AND THREE GUESTS.

13:29.500 --> 13:31.733
Proceed up
the driveway please.

14:12.167 --> 14:14.633
- Jeff: WOW.
- Larry: WOW.

14:15.700 --> 14:17.667
Larry:
LOOK AT THIS
THING, HUH?

14:17.700 --> 14:21.633
Wilson:
MERCEDES BENZ,
SL300 SI.

14:21.667 --> 14:23.367
- Jeff: YOU KNOW IT, HUH?
- Wilson: UM-HMM.

14:39.267 --> 14:41.900
( screaming )

14:50.467 --> 14:52.567
WHAT DID
YOU DO?

14:53.700 --> 14:55.833
Andy:
WHAT IS WITH YOU?

14:55.867 --> 14:57.367
WHAT? I--

14:57.400 --> 14:58.800
WHAT DID YOU DO?

14:58.833 --> 15:00.300
I DON'T KNOW.

15:04.067 --> 15:05.733
SORRY.

15:07.300 --> 15:10.067
I GOT TO USE
THE BATHROOM.

15:18.400 --> 15:20.367
( toilet flushes )

15:20.400 --> 15:22.133
( voices talking )

15:23.467 --> 15:26.067
WELL... HEY...

15:26.100 --> 15:28.167
- HOW DO YOU DO?
- HELLO THERE.

15:28.200 --> 15:31.133
- HI, LARRY DAVID.
- HUGH HEFNER.

15:31.167 --> 15:32.500
- YES, NICE TO MEET YOU.
- MY PLEASURE, WELCOME.

15:32.533 --> 15:33.867
- HI, I'M HOLLY.
- HELLO. HI.

15:33.900 --> 15:36.367
- BRIDGET.
- HELLO. HI.

15:36.400 --> 15:39.067
- YOU'RE A GUEST OF...?
- JEFF GREENE.

15:39.067 --> 15:40.667
- YES. SURE.
- OH, YOU KNOW HIM?

15:40.700 --> 15:42.667
- SURE. YEAH.
- SEE, I THOUGHT HE WAS
PRETENDING THE WHOLE TIME.

15:42.700 --> 15:44.467
NO, IT'S TRUE.
YEAH.

15:44.500 --> 15:47.800
WHAT'S THAT ANIMAL
WALKING AROUND OUTSIDE
WITH THE LONG NECK?

15:47.833 --> 15:49.967
WHAT DO YOU
CALL THAT?

15:50.067 --> 15:51.300
WELL, IT'S PROBABLY
A FLAMINGO.

15:51.333 --> 15:53.433
OH, FLAMINGO.

15:53.467 --> 15:56.433
I'M NOT GOOD
AT IDENTIFYING
BIRDS AND ANIMALS.

15:56.467 --> 15:59.233
YOU KNOW, LIKE SNEAKERS,
I CAN IDENTIFY.

15:59.267 --> 16:02.300
CONVERSE, ADIDAS,
I KNOW ALL THAT STUFF.

16:02.333 --> 16:04.633
I KNOW SNEAKERS,
BIRDS I DON'T KNOW FROM.

16:04.667 --> 16:08.667
THIS IS--
YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:08.700 --> 16:10.967
THIS SMOKING JACKET--

16:11.067 --> 16:14.833
MY FATHER'S GOT THE EXACT
SAME SMOKING JACKET.

16:14.867 --> 16:16.867
HMMM, I DOUBT IT.

16:16.900 --> 16:19.367
- DOUBT IT?
- WELL, IT'S AN ORIGINAL.

16:19.400 --> 16:21.300
I HAVE THEM IMPORTED
FROM ITALY.

16:21.333 --> 16:23.700
- REALLY?
- IT'S A ROSELLI.

16:23.733 --> 16:25.400
- UH-HUH.
- ONE OF A KIND.

16:25.433 --> 16:27.333
I DON'T KNOW.

16:27.367 --> 16:29.067
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
- HMM?

16:29.067 --> 16:30.833
I GOT IT
RIGHT OUT IN THE CAR.

16:30.867 --> 16:32.467
- WELL, I'D
LIKE TO SEE IT.
- WOULD YOU?

16:32.500 --> 16:33.500
- SURE.
- CAN I GO GET IT?

16:33.533 --> 16:35.867
- SURE.
- THEN STAY RIGHT HERE.

16:35.900 --> 16:38.200
I'LL GO GET
THE SMOKING JACKET.
STAY RIGHT HERE.

16:38.233 --> 16:40.300
I THINK IT'S
THE EXACT SAME ONE.
I'M NOT KIDDING.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.700
UNBELIEVABLE.

16:44.767 --> 16:46.800
( giggling )

16:56.533 --> 16:58.333
HEY.

16:58.367 --> 16:59.600
WHAT?

16:59.633 --> 17:01.200
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

17:01.233 --> 17:02.333
- WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ME?
- YEAH.

17:02.367 --> 17:03.867
YOU RUINED MY WISH.

17:03.900 --> 17:05.200
IT COULD HAVE BEEN
A COINCIDENCE.

17:05.233 --> 17:07.667
THEY RAN AWAY
FROM YOU, LARRY.

17:07.700 --> 17:09.600
IT WASN'T MY FAULT.

17:09.633 --> 17:12.867
WELL, IT WAS OBVIOUSLY
SOMETHING ABOUT YOU
THAT MADE THEM DO THAT.

17:12.900 --> 17:15.667
- DO ME A FAVOR,
HAND ME THAT JACKET.
- WHY?

17:15.700 --> 17:18.500
BECAUSE I WANT
TO SHOW IT TO HEFNER.

17:18.533 --> 17:20.067
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU WANT TO SHOW IT?

17:20.067 --> 17:23.567
LISTEN, GET IN THE CAR.
REALLY, I'M-- THIS WHOLE
DAY WAS JUST A MESS.

17:23.600 --> 17:25.167
COME ON,
HAND ME THE JACKET.

17:25.200 --> 17:26.267
- NO.
- WHAT?

17:26.300 --> 17:27.367
- NO.
- WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

17:27.400 --> 17:29.733
- JUST GET IN THE CAR, COME ON.
- HUH?

17:29.767 --> 17:31.567
- I WANNA GO.
- LOOK, YOU LITTLE SHIT--

17:31.600 --> 17:33.100
- WHAT THE--
GIVE ME THAT JACKET!
- NO!

17:36.767 --> 17:39.067
HEY.

17:39.067 --> 17:42.467
I DIDN'T KNOCK.
I FIGURED YOU KNEW
I WAS GOING OUT--

17:42.500 --> 17:44.100
- I COULD JUST COME IN--
- SURE.

17:44.133 --> 17:45.967
SO I TOOK THAT LIBERTY.
I HOPE IT'S OKAY.

17:46.067 --> 17:49.067
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
HUH?

17:49.100 --> 17:51.067
- I'M AMAZED.
- IT'S THE SAME THING.

17:51.067 --> 17:54.200
WELL, IT'S NOT A ROSELLI
BUT IT'S A GREAT KNOCK-OFF.

17:54.233 --> 17:58.133
- REALLY?
- YEAH, LET ME TRY IT ON.

17:58.167 --> 18:00.500
THERE YOU GO.

18:02.300 --> 18:05.433
( chuckles )
IT EVEN FITS.

18:05.467 --> 18:08.233
WAIT TILL MY FATHER
HEARS THAT HUGH HEFNER

18:08.267 --> 18:10.167
WAS TRYING ON
HIS SMOKING JACKET.

18:10.200 --> 18:11.767
HE'S GOING
TO FREAK OUT.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.833
WOW. PRETTY GOOD.

18:13.867 --> 18:14.900
- Bridget: IT LOOKS GOOD.
- Holly: YEAH.

18:14.933 --> 18:17.200
PRETTY, PRETTY GOOD.

18:17.233 --> 18:19.533
LET ME LOOK AT IT
IN THE MIRROR.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.133
NOT BAD.

18:26.633 --> 18:29.600
EXCUSE ME.

18:36.067 --> 18:38.833
WHERE DO YOU LIVE?

18:38.867 --> 18:41.267
IN LOS ANGELES.

18:41.733 --> 18:44.167
YEAH.

18:49.367 --> 18:51.433
I NOTICED
THEY GOT SOME...

18:51.467 --> 18:54.433
- WHAT, THEY GOT SOME
MONKEYS OUT THERE, HUH?
- YEAH.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.400
YOU DON'T
GOT MUCH POCKETS
IN THERE, HUH?

18:56.433 --> 18:59.233
- NOT TOO MANY POCKETS THERE.
- WE DON'T NEED POCKETS.

18:59.267 --> 19:00.833
I COULDN'T LIVE
WITHOUT POCKETS.

19:00.867 --> 19:04.167
LOOK, I'M NOT A DENTIST,
BUT I ENJOY DISCUSSING
DENTAL HYGIENE...

19:04.200 --> 19:07.800
THEY'RE MONKEYS,
THEY'LL ATTACK YOU.
THEY'LL CLAW YOU TO DEATH.

19:07.833 --> 19:11.433
I'D SAY GUM STIMULATION,
VERY IMPORTANT,
FLOSSING...

19:11.467 --> 19:15.733
THERE ARE PEOPLE, THOUGH,
LET'S FACE IT, WHO DO HAVE
A FOOT ODOR PROBLEM.

19:15.767 --> 19:17.967
ARE YOU SAYING
I HAVE DIRTY FEET?

19:21.800 --> 19:23.900
- YOUR NAME IS
WHAT AGAIN? I FORGOT.
- BRIDGET.

19:23.933 --> 19:26.067
- AND YOU ARE?
- HOLLY.

19:26.100 --> 19:27.233
HOLLY.

19:27.267 --> 19:29.067
MAYBE WE SHOULD GO
BOWLING SOMETIME?

19:29.067 --> 19:30.900
Bridget:
MAYBE.

19:30.933 --> 19:33.867
I DON'T THINK YOU WANT
TO GO BOWLING WITH ME.

19:33.900 --> 19:37.667
LET'S PRETEND TO BE
VENTRILOQUISTS, OKAY?

19:42.667 --> 19:44.300
( toilet flushes )

19:47.200 --> 19:50.433
REMARKABLE.
THEY DO IMPRESSIVE
WORK IN KOREA.

19:50.467 --> 19:52.700
YOU'RE WANTED
AT THE GROTTO
NOW, BABY.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.700
- AH. EXCUSE ME.
- Holly: SEE YOU LATER.

19:54.733 --> 19:56.233
- Larry: BYE.
- Hefner: BYE BYE.

20:22.067 --> 20:24.867
Cheryl:
THE PLAYBOY MANSION?
THAT'S WHERE YOU WERE?

20:24.900 --> 20:27.033
YOU DIDN'T THINK
THAT I WOULD MIND

20:27.067 --> 20:28.500
THAT YOU'RE RUNNING AROUND
WITH NUDE WOMEN?

20:28.533 --> 20:31.700
THERE'S NO NUDE WOMEN.
THEY COVERED ALL UP
WHEN THEY SAW ME.

20:31.733 --> 20:35.567
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW HARD I'VE BEEN WORKING
ON YOUR BIRTHDAY PRESENT.

20:35.600 --> 20:38.100
I HAD THIS PHONE NUMBER
WRITTEN ON THE BACK
OF A MAGAZINE,

20:38.133 --> 20:40.167
- WHICH YOU THREW OUT.
- I-I'M SORRY.

20:40.200 --> 20:42.100
AND I FINALLY
GOT IT BACK.

20:42.133 --> 20:44.033
I HAVE ARRANGED
FOR YOU TO HAVE LUNCH

20:44.067 --> 20:46.567
AND PLAY A ROUND OF GOLF
WITH GARY PLAYER.

20:46.600 --> 20:50.633
- GARY PLAYER?
- YES, BECAUSE HE'S
A HUGE "SEINFELD" FAN,

20:50.667 --> 20:53.200
- AND NOW I JUST
FEEL LIKE, WHY...?
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!

20:53.233 --> 20:56.267
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
NO, NO, NO!
- I'M GOING TO RIP IT UP...

20:56.300 --> 20:58.133
WAIT, WAIT.

20:58.167 --> 21:00.833
- NO, I DON'T THINK
YOU DESERVE THIS.
- OH, MY GOD.

21:00.867 --> 21:03.333
- YES.
- NO, NO, I'M SORRY.
I'M REALLY SORRY.

21:03.367 --> 21:05.667
BUT WHAT CAN I SAY?

21:05.700 --> 21:08.867
I KNEW YOU WERE
ALREADY MAD AT ME
FOR THE MAGAZINE, OKAY?

21:08.900 --> 21:11.467
SO I FIGURED,
I MIGHT AS WELL
GO TO THE MANSION,

21:11.500 --> 21:14.800
- SO ONE APOLOGY
WOULD COVER BOTH OF THEM.
- THAT WAS YOUR LOGIC?

21:14.833 --> 21:16.967
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE THE DOG
WHO PEES ON THE RUG.

21:17.067 --> 21:18.400
HE KNOWS HE'S GETTING
SENT TO THE DOGHOUSE,

21:18.433 --> 21:21.933
SO ON THE WAY,
HE GRABS SOME FOOD
OFF THE KITCHEN TABLE.

21:21.967 --> 21:25.267
IT'S THE "DOUBLE
TRANSGRESSION" THEORY.

21:25.300 --> 21:27.800
HOW DID YOU EVEN KNOW
THAT I LIKE GARY PLAYER,
BY THE WAY?

21:27.833 --> 21:31.067
I REMEMBER YOU SAID
WHEN YOU WERE A KID
YOU LOVED GARY PLAYER

21:31.067 --> 21:33.767
AND HE WAS YOUR FAVORITE.
YOU LIKED HIM MORE
THAN PALMER...

21:33.800 --> 21:36.100
- YOU REMEMBERED THAT?
- I REMEMBERED THAT.

21:36.133 --> 21:37.700
Andy:
OKAY, WATCH THE STEP.

21:37.733 --> 21:39.700
YOU GOT A STEP AND YOU GOT
A LITTLE CARPET HERE.
HEY YA GUYS.

21:39.733 --> 21:41.933
- Cheryl: HI.

21:41.967 --> 21:43.700
POP-SICOLA.

21:43.733 --> 21:46.267

WHAT I DID LAST NIGHT?

21:46.300 --> 21:47.900
- I HAD A DATE.
- THE PLAYMATE?

21:47.933 --> 21:49.733
YOU BETCHA.
BOBBI SUE.

21:49.767 --> 21:51.967
- IT'S GOING GREAT.
SHE'S TERRIFIC.
- Cheryl: FANTASTIC.

21:52.067 --> 21:54.800
- Andy: I KNOW, HUH?
- HOW ABOUT YOUR NEPHEW
OVER HERE, HUH?

21:54.833 --> 21:57.567
YEAH, THAT'S WORTH
THE TRIP FROM NEW YORK, HUH?
( laughing )

21:57.600 --> 22:00.100
HOW'S IT GOING, POPS?
HOW'S THE NURSING HOME?

22:00.133 --> 22:02.800
EH, I DON'T LIKE IT
THERE SO MUCH. YOU KNOW.

22:02.833 --> 22:04.967
- WHY?
- WE'LL PUT YOU
SOMEPLACE ELSE.

22:05.067 --> 22:07.167
THEY STEAL FROM ME.
I AM TELLING YOU
SOMETHING, LARRY.

22:07.200 --> 22:08.933
- THEY'RE STEALING FROM ME.
- THEY'RE STEALING?

22:08.967 --> 22:11.767
YOU KNOW
MY BEAUTIFUL JACKET,
MY SMOKING JACKET?

22:11.800 --> 22:13.900
WITH THE RED
AND THE--

22:13.933 --> 22:16.233
AND SATIN?

22:16.267 --> 22:17.667
YEAH, SURE.
YOUR SMOKING JACKET.

22:17.700 --> 22:20.267
- THEY TOOK IT.
- Andy: NO, NO, NO.

22:20.300 --> 22:23.600
- THEY TOOK MY SMOKING JACKET.
- UNCLE NAT, NO, NO.
YOU SENT IT TO ME.

22:23.633 --> 22:27.267
YOU ACTUALLY PROBABLY
MEANT TO SEND IT TO ME
FOR MY BIRTHDAY.

22:27.300 --> 22:30.200
NO, YOU SENT IT TO ME
BECAUSE MY NAME WAS
ON THE PACKAGE.

22:30.233 --> 22:33.633
- YOU ALWAYS SAID YOU WANTED ME
TO HAVE THAT JACKET.
- YOU GAVE IT TO ME.

22:33.667 --> 22:35.700
- Nat: HEY, GENTLEMEN!
- HE SENT IT TO ME!

22:35.733 --> 22:39.900
- YOU SAID-- NAT--
- WHY THE HELL WOULD I SEND
THAT BEAUTIFUL JACKET

22:39.933 --> 22:42.633
TO EITHER OF YOU?
I LOVE THAT JACKET.

22:42.667 --> 22:44.733
ALL RIGHT, HOLD ON.

22:44.767 --> 22:46.400
WHAT?

22:47.733 --> 22:50.667
WHAT'S THAT?

22:55.800 --> 22:57.867
WHAT THE HECK IS THIS?
THIS IS NOT MY--

22:57.900 --> 22:59.900
THIS IS NOT
MY SMOKING JACKET.

23:00.067 --> 23:02.067
- IT'S NOT.
- WELL I'M SORRY.

23:02.067 --> 23:05.067
MY JACKET
IS A ROSELLI JACKET.
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS THING.

23:05.067 --> 23:07.833
TAKE A LOOK AT THE SEAMS HERE.
IT'S A SHMATA, MAN.

23:07.867 --> 23:10.567
IT'S NOT MY--
THIS IS A KNOCK-OFF
OF MY JACKET.

23:10.600 --> 23:13.467
- WHAT?
- HOW DID YOU GET A HOLD
OF THIS DRECK?

23:13.500 --> 23:15.667
- THIS IS A KNOCK-OFF?
- IT'S A KNOCK-OFF.

23:15.700 --> 23:16.933
IT'S A CHEAP,
CHEAP IMITATION.

23:16.967 --> 23:18.333
THIS IS NOT
A ROSELLI?

23:18.367 --> 23:21.433
THIS IS NOT A ROSELLI.
HOW DID YOU GET IT?

23:21.467 --> 23:24.067
( mutters )
HOLY SHIT.

23:25.900 --> 23:28.133
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL GET YOUR JACKET BACK.

23:28.167 --> 23:30.167
- ALL RIGHT...
- TODAY. I'M GETTING IT
BACK TODAY.

23:30.200 --> 23:33.467
- ALL RIGHT.
- HUGH HEFNER.
HE'S GOT MY JACKET.

23:33.500 --> 23:35.567
HUGH HEFNER
HAS YOUR JACKET?

23:35.600 --> 23:37.933
HUGH HEFNER
TOOK MY JACKET?

23:53.067 --> 23:54.933
- HI.
- LARRY.

23:54.967 --> 23:56.967
SORRY--

23:57.067 --> 23:59.700
SORRY FOR
BOTHERING YOU BUT--

23:59.733 --> 24:02.800
THE OTHER DAY
WHEN I WAS HERE,
I MISTAKENLY

24:02.833 --> 24:05.533
TOOK THE WRONG
SMOKING JACKET AND--

24:05.567 --> 24:09.767
I'M SORRY,
THIS IS YOUR SMOKING JACKET.
THAT ONE'S ACTUALLY MY FATHER'S.

24:09.800 --> 24:10.900
I APOLOGIZE.

24:10.933 --> 24:12.100
I DON'T THINK SO.

24:13.433 --> 24:17.167
THIS IS A ROSELLI.
THAT'S A KNOCK-OFF.

24:17.200 --> 24:20.233
NO, NO NO.
THIS IS THE ROSELLI.

24:20.267 --> 24:23.100
THAT'S THE KNOCK-OFF.
THAT'S MY FATHER'S.

24:23.133 --> 24:25.667
I CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE.
THAT'S THE KNOCK-OFF.

24:25.700 --> 24:28.400
WELL, HERE.
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TAKE
ANOTHER LOOK AT IT.

24:28.433 --> 24:31.700
I REALLY HAVEN'T GOT TIME
FOR THIS. THEY'RE WAITING
FOR ME UPSTAIRS.

24:31.733 --> 24:33.500
- I'M SORRY.
- YOU GOT THE WRONG JACKET.

24:33.533 --> 24:36.067
- I'M SORRY.
- THAT'S MY FATHER'S JACKET.

24:38.967 --> 24:41.100
WHO'S WAITING FOR YOU
UPSTAIRS?

24:44.967 --> 24:47.067
( beeps slowly )

24:47.067 --> 24:51.200
SO, ANY...
CHANGE?

24:52.733 --> 24:54.633
HAS HE GOTTEN
ANY WORSE?

24:54.667 --> 24:58.267
NO, IT'S ABOUT THE SAME.
NO WORSE, NO BETTER.

24:58.300 --> 25:00.400
- DAMN.
- YEAH. YOU KNOW,

25:00.433 --> 25:04.167
I HAVE TO TELL YOU
THAT I'M QUITE IMPRESSED
WITH YOUR DEDICATION...

25:04.200 --> 25:06.100
- REALLY?
- ...TO VISITING THIS PATIENT.

25:06.133 --> 25:07.600
OH, THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

25:07.633 --> 25:09.633
THAT'S VERY NICE
OF YOU THOUGH.

25:09.667 --> 25:12.100
WELL, IT IS
MY FRIEND'S COUSIN.

25:12.133 --> 25:14.300
YES.

25:15.833 --> 25:17.967
HOW DO YOU KNOW
IF HE'S DEAD?

25:19.400 --> 25:21.933
WELL, IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE.
THERE'S NO HEARTBEAT,

25:21.967 --> 25:24.133
NO BRAIN ACTIVITY,
AND IF ANYTHING HAPPENS--

25:24.167 --> 25:26.700
BECAUSE HE'S AN ORGAN DONOR,
AND HIS ORGANS NEED TO BE FREE.

25:26.733 --> 25:29.067
YES, I UNDERSTAND THAT.
WE'VE GOT THAT UNDER--

25:29.067 --> 25:30.133
IF HE SITS HERE
LIKE A LOX FOR
A COUPLE OF WEEKS

25:30.167 --> 25:31.933
THE ORGANS AREN'T
GOING TO BE WORTH IT.

25:31.967 --> 25:33.533
WELL, I DON'T THINK
THAT WILL BE A PROBLEM.

25:33.567 --> 25:35.700
- WE GOT THAT COVERED.
- OKAY. WELL, THANK YOU.

25:35.733 --> 25:37.867
OKAY, LISTEN-- ONCE AGAIN
LIKE I SAID,

25:37.900 --> 25:39.933
IT'S VERY NICE OF YOU
TO DO WHAT YOU'RE DOING
WITH HIM--

25:39.967 --> 25:42.467
OH YEAH, IT'S
THE LEAST I COULD DO.

25:42.500 --> 25:44.333
- WELL, GOOD. GOOD
TALKING TO YOU, OKAY?
- OKAY.

25:44.367 --> 25:46.667
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

25:46.700 --> 25:49.300
- AH...!
- WASN'T THAT LOVELY?

25:49.333 --> 25:51.367
YES, LOOK WHO'S HERE.

25:51.400 --> 25:53.833
HMM. HOW'S IT GOING
WITH THE WISH?

25:55.767 --> 25:58.900
- I DON'T KNOW,
I'M KIND OF OUT OF IDEAS.
- UM-HMM. REALLY?

25:58.933 --> 26:00.667
- HEY, YOU KNOW, I TOOK YOU--
- YOU OWE ME!

26:00.700 --> 26:02.333
I TOOK YOU
TO THE PLAYBOY MANSION.

26:02.367 --> 26:05.567
- WHAT ELSE
DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
- I WANT TO SEE A NAKED WOMAN.

26:05.600 --> 26:09.467
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, GET DRESSED.
I'LL THINK OF SOMETHING.

26:09.500 --> 26:11.200
- WHERE ARE WE GOING?
- I DON'T KNOW.
I'LL HAVE TO THINK.

26:11.233 --> 26:14.233
- HURRY UP.
GET DRESSED. COME ON.
- OKAY.

26:14.267 --> 26:16.700
YOU'RE GETTING TO BE
A REAL PAIN IN THE ASS,
YOU KNOW THAT?

26:22.233 --> 26:25.167
- Wilson:
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?
- I FORGOT MY CELL PHONE.

26:26.367 --> 26:29.133
MY WIFE'S IN NEW YORK.
SHE GETS VERY AGGRAVATED

26:29.167 --> 26:31.933
IF SHE CAN'T GET
IN TOUCH WITH ME
24 HOURS A DAY.

26:31.967 --> 26:34.867
I HAVE TO HAVE CONSTANT
CONTACT ALL THE TIME.

26:34.900 --> 26:37.167
WHOA.
IS THIS PLACE
YOUR HOUSE?

26:37.200 --> 26:39.700
NAH, WE'RE JUST RENTING.
THEY'RE WORKING ON MY HOUSE.

26:45.567 --> 26:47.700
( moaning )

26:49.633 --> 26:53.400
OH, MY GOD.

26:55.167 --> 26:56.867
LARRY!

27:04.167 --> 27:07.533
SO WILSON,
HAVE YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT ANOTHER WISH?

27:07.567 --> 27:09.100
YES, I HAVE.

27:09.133 --> 27:11.800
MY WISH IS FOR HUGH HEFNER'S
SMOKING JACKET.

27:11.833 --> 27:14.833
THE RED ONE
WITH THE BLACK TRIM.

27:14.867 --> 27:16.867
THE ROSELLI.

27:20.367 --> 27:22.100
- LARRY.
- HEY, GARY.

27:22.133 --> 27:24.533
- WHAT A PLEASURE.
- GREAT TO MEET YOU.

27:24.567 --> 27:26.900
OH, NICE TO MEET YOU.
I'VE BEEN SUCH A FAN
OF "SEINFELD"

27:26.933 --> 27:30.500
AND TO HAVE LUNCH WITH YOU,
AND 18 HOLES OF GOLF,
WHAT A WAY TO HAVE A DAY.

27:30.533 --> 27:32.100
- OH, MY GOD.
- COME RIGHT IN.

27:32.133 --> 27:34.433
I CAN'T BELIEVE MY WIFE
GOT IN TOUCH WITH YOU
TO DO THIS.

27:34.467 --> 27:36.933
- IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
- HANG ON TO HER,
SHE'S A GOOD ONE.

27:36.967 --> 27:40.067
THIS JACKET?
MY FRIEND GAVE IT TO ME
FOR A BIRTHDAY PRESENT.

27:40.067 --> 27:43.067
IT'S UNCANNY, LARRY.
THAT'S EXACTLY LIKE
THE JACKET

27:43.067 --> 27:44.800
THEY AWARD YOU WHEN
YOU WIN THE MASTERS.

27:44.833 --> 27:47.133
NOW THERE'S A 1961
MASTERS JACKET.

27:47.167 --> 27:48.967
- WOW.
- ISN'T THAT A BEAUTY?

27:49.067 --> 27:51.067
- LOOK AT THIS?
EXACTLY THE SAME.
- EXACTLY.

27:51.067 --> 27:52.533
- WHY DON'T YOU TRY IT ON?
- REALLY?

27:52.567 --> 27:55.133
ABSOLUTELY.
PUT IT ON.

27:55.167 --> 27:57.600
( chuckles )

27:57.633 --> 27:58.900
WOW.

27:58.933 --> 28:01.633
I CANNOT
GET OVER HOW SIMILAR
THIS JACKET IS TO THAT.

28:01.667 --> 28:05.067
YOU MIND IF I JUST
GO AND HAVE A LOOK
AT THIS IN THE MIRROR?

28:05.067 --> 28:08.400
WHAT?
THIS IS THE ONE YOU BEAT
PALMER IN '61, RIGHT?

28:08.433 --> 28:09.600
ABSOLUTELY.
COME ON.

28:09.633 --> 28:11.533
LOOK AT THAT.
HEY, IT FITS YOU.

28:11.567 --> 28:13.300
YEAH.
( laughs )

28:13.333 --> 28:15.533
YOU'LL HAVE
TO EXCUSE ME
A MINUTE.

28:28.367 --> 28:38.400
( theme music playing )

28:38.400 --> 28:48.400
( theme music playing )
