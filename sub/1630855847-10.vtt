[tense music]

* *

00:10.885 --> 00:12.846
[gunshot]

00:12.887 --> 00:15.515
- You sacrificed
my boy for another.

00:15.557 --> 00:16.891
You're no hero.

00:16.933 --> 00:19.019
Stay the hell away from my son.

00:19.060 --> 00:20.645
[door slams]

00:23.898 --> 00:26.026
- Wait, Gabi.

00:26.067 --> 00:27.193
Tony's father hates us.

00:27.235 --> 00:29.154
- He hates me.

00:29.195 --> 00:30.822
But we still have to try.

00:34.075 --> 00:35.368
- Not a chance.

00:35.410 --> 00:37.078
- Mr. Edwards, please.
I'm here to help.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.121
- Help?

00:38.163 --> 00:39.664
You got my son shot.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.374
He's been in a coma
for over a month.

00:41.416 --> 00:43.335
- Your son was involved
in a horrible crime--

00:43.376 --> 00:44.753
- I need security!

00:44.794 --> 00:46.588
This woman is harassing us.
- Gabi, let's go.

00:46.629 --> 00:49.090
- I know Tony
was manipulated,

00:49.132 --> 00:50.550
but the police and public
see him

00:50.592 --> 00:52.302
as a criminal, not a victim.

00:52.344 --> 00:54.721
If I know Tony is awake
and made it across town,

00:54.763 --> 00:56.514
DCPD can't be far behind.

00:56.556 --> 00:58.558
- Dad?

00:58.600 --> 01:01.227
- It's okay, son.

01:01.269 --> 01:02.854
- I know you hate me,

01:02.896 --> 01:05.106
but allow my firm
to work with you and Tony

01:05.148 --> 01:06.816
to take down
whoever victimized him.

01:06.858 --> 01:10.612
I promise you, I can keep
your son out of prison.

01:10.653 --> 01:12.614
- Go to hell.

01:12.655 --> 01:14.407
Thank you.
These ladies--

01:14.449 --> 01:15.700
- Sir, if you can
step back, please.

01:15.742 --> 01:16.951
- No, it's for
these ladies right here.

01:16.993 --> 01:18.328
No, no--
- Tony Edwards,

01:18.370 --> 01:19.746
you're under arrest
for the kidnapping

01:19.788 --> 01:20.997
of Matthew Robinson.

01:21.039 --> 01:22.415
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:22.457 --> 01:24.042
- Dad, do something, please.
- Handcuffs?

01:24.084 --> 01:26.294
He is still
under doctors' care.

01:26.336 --> 01:27.754
- Step back!
- He's a child!

01:27.796 --> 01:29.381
- You have the right
to an attorney.

01:29.422 --> 01:31.174
If you cannot afford one--
[all talking]

01:31.216 --> 01:35.095
[spacey music]

01:35.136 --> 01:36.513
- ...is a problem.

01:36.554 --> 01:37.931
And I'm afraid
to live in a world

01:37.972 --> 01:40.392
where private citizens
like Gabi Mosely

01:40.433 --> 01:42.143
play fast and loose
with the law.

01:42.185 --> 01:45.730
- DCPD's review of Mosely
and Associates' PI license

01:45.772 --> 01:48.233
is egregious.
By all accounts,

01:48.274 --> 01:50.110
Captain Mallory has had it out

01:50.151 --> 01:51.861
for Gabi Mosely since day one.

01:51.903 --> 01:53.947
- Well, that may be true,
but Melissa Derr is dead.

01:53.988 --> 01:55.990
And does anyone really believe
they should be putting

01:56.032 --> 01:57.617
their faith in Gabi Mosely?

01:57.659 --> 01:59.994
- [sighs]

02:00.036 --> 02:02.997
[somber music]

02:03.039 --> 02:09.921
* *

02:09.963 --> 02:12.173
[line trilling]

02:18.555 --> 02:21.141
- Hello, son.
This is a surprise.

02:21.182 --> 02:22.517
- I need a favor.

02:22.559 --> 02:25.729
- Usually the only time
I hear from you.

02:25.770 --> 02:27.188
- Mosely and Associates
is at risk

02:27.230 --> 02:28.523
for losing their PI license,

02:28.565 --> 02:29.941
which could ultimately
shut us down.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.526
You're on
the Senate subcommittee

02:31.568 --> 02:33.111
overseeing criminal justice.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.196
Can you help us make
this problem go away?

02:35.238 --> 02:36.781
- I assume you use your...

02:36.823 --> 02:39.451
illegal computer talents
to help M&A?

02:39.492 --> 02:41.327
- Dad, can--can we not today?

02:41.369 --> 02:43.496
My computers are
my only real connection

02:43.538 --> 02:44.622
to the outside world.

02:44.664 --> 02:46.833
- I'm aware of that, Zeke.

02:46.875 --> 02:51.588
But look, I've tried
to understand you, but you--

02:51.629 --> 02:53.548
you're always
so closed off with me.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.842
- I don't wanna rehash
the past, okay?

02:55.884 --> 02:56.926
I don't.

02:56.968 --> 03:01.514
Can you help me or not?

03:01.556 --> 03:03.475
- You've funded
Mosely and Associates

03:03.516 --> 03:05.393
with part of your trust fund.

03:05.435 --> 03:08.772
Haven't you done
enough for them?

03:08.813 --> 03:12.025
- My M&A family, they help me
get through the day.

03:12.067 --> 03:14.235
Without them,
without the work that they do,

03:14.277 --> 03:15.779
I don't know
what happens to me.

03:15.820 --> 03:18.948
Dad, I--I never ask you
for anything.

03:18.990 --> 03:20.367
I don't.

03:20.408 --> 03:23.036
Please, I'm just
asking you to try.

03:23.078 --> 03:25.413
Please, Dad.

03:25.455 --> 03:28.041
- Yeah, I'll look into it.

03:28.083 --> 03:29.876
[phone beeps]

03:34.923 --> 03:38.176
- We have no comment
at this time.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.803
I can't believe
this is happening.

03:39.844 --> 03:41.429
I mean, if we lose
our license over Mallory

03:41.471 --> 03:42.806
and his ridiculous attempt

03:42.847 --> 03:44.641
to blame Gabi
for Melissa's passing--

03:44.683 --> 03:46.851
- Ethan's worried about
what kind of emotional relapse

03:46.893 --> 03:49.604
I might have without M&A.

03:49.646 --> 03:51.439
- Hey, I heard
Tony Edwards is awake.

03:51.481 --> 03:53.233
I just, uh, came
to see how I can help.

03:53.274 --> 03:54.359
Is Tony talking?

03:54.401 --> 03:55.568
- DCPD's already arrested him.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.112
- Well, I know,
but I also heard

03:57.153 --> 03:58.571
Gabi was already there,

03:58.613 --> 03:59.906
so I just wasn't sure
if he gave up anything

03:59.948 --> 04:01.533
about the
trafficking ring first.

04:01.574 --> 04:03.118
- I'm sorry, but I was under
the impression

04:03.159 --> 04:04.911
that after what happened
with Melissa's ransom drop,

04:04.953 --> 04:07.455
that you and Gabi were
taking some space.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.749
- Personal space, yes.

04:09.791 --> 04:11.960
But this is about nailing
the trafficking bastard

04:12.002 --> 04:13.503
that roped in Tony.

04:16.047 --> 04:17.924
- Tony is refusing
to talk to police.

04:17.966 --> 04:19.843
Patrick's refusing
to talk to us.

04:19.884 --> 04:21.094
We need a game plan

04:21.136 --> 04:23.054
to figure out
how to get around Patrick,

04:23.096 --> 04:24.431
to get Tony to trust us.

04:24.472 --> 04:26.182
- Gabi, I want
what's best for Tony,

04:26.224 --> 04:28.601
but we have to respect
his father's wishes this time.

04:28.643 --> 04:29.811
- Agreed.
Besides,

04:29.853 --> 04:31.813
with our license
in flux right now,

04:31.855 --> 04:33.773
taking on a high-profile case
like Tony's

04:33.815 --> 04:35.734
might not be good for M&A
or Tony.

04:35.775 --> 04:38.194
- The boy was arrested--
literally

04:38.236 --> 04:41.614
handcuffed to a hospital bed
with dinosaur sheets.

04:41.656 --> 04:45.702
This is a child
who nobody's protecting.

04:45.744 --> 04:47.871
- We take down the monster
behind that trafficking ring.

04:47.912 --> 04:49.539
Nothing gets
in the way of that,

04:49.581 --> 04:51.791
not Patrick,
not some little piece of paper.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.501
- I'm with Gabi and Dhan.

04:53.543 --> 04:55.086
- Operating without
that little piece of paper

04:55.128 --> 04:57.088
could land Gabi behind bars.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.465
Who can we help then?

04:58.506 --> 04:59.674
A little help here, Trent?

04:59.716 --> 05:01.134
Please tell them
that I'm right.

05:01.176 --> 05:03.386
- This is ultimately
an M&A business decision,

05:03.428 --> 05:04.679
and I'm not part of M&A.

05:04.721 --> 05:06.097
So someone give me a call

05:06.139 --> 05:08.099
when Tony or Patrick change
their mind.

05:10.685 --> 05:13.438
- We owe Tony and his father.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.939
We're moving forward
with the case.

05:14.981 --> 05:17.609
- How do we move forward
without Patrick's consent?

05:19.402 --> 05:21.529
- He was in the lobby.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.907
- I need to speak to you.

05:23.948 --> 05:25.992
Seeing those officers
handcuff my son,

05:26.034 --> 05:28.078
questioning him
like he's some criminal--

05:28.119 --> 05:31.289
if you're as desperate to make
amends as you say you are,

05:31.331 --> 05:32.499
then you're the only one
motivated enough

05:32.540 --> 05:33.792
to keep my boy out of prison.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.752
- Mr. Edwards,
there is nothing

05:35.794 --> 05:38.046
I want more than to keep good
on my promise

05:38.088 --> 05:41.007
to protect your son.

05:41.049 --> 05:42.967
- Then you're hired.

05:43.009 --> 05:45.428
- As soon as Tony's final scans
are in today,

05:45.470 --> 05:47.389
he'll be discharged
into police custody.

05:47.430 --> 05:49.099
We need to get Tony
into our care

05:49.140 --> 05:51.017
before that happens.
Head to the hospital

05:51.059 --> 05:52.936
and do not leave his side
until I call.

05:52.977 --> 05:55.271
I'll make sure Trent is there,
too, in case of any trouble.

05:55.313 --> 05:57.524
- Okay.

05:57.565 --> 05:59.109
- The gray sedan
Matthew climbed into is

05:59.150 --> 06:00.777
the same car
from the drive-by shooting

06:00.819 --> 06:02.195
at the Founding Fathers Inn.

06:02.237 --> 06:03.738
- We also know
that Tony's behavior changed

06:03.780 --> 06:05.073
about six months
before he took Matthew,

06:05.115 --> 06:06.491
so whoever groomed Tony

06:06.533 --> 06:08.118
likely made initial contact
around then.

06:08.159 --> 06:09.202
- Okay, before we dive in,

06:09.244 --> 06:10.662
can we name who we're after?

06:10.704 --> 06:12.205
Because "unnamed trafficking
insert expletive"

06:12.247 --> 06:13.873
is a mouthful.

06:13.915 --> 06:17.627
- I've been using
"Bennett" as a placeholder.

06:17.669 --> 06:19.045
- That has
personal meaning to you.

06:19.087 --> 06:20.839
- I was taken
from Bennett Lane.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.633
That was my home street
in Georgia.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.638
- Okay, then.
What do we know about Bennett?

06:28.680 --> 06:30.265
- According to Matthew's
witness statement,

06:30.306 --> 06:31.933
the shooter was male.
But he couldn't remember enough

06:31.975 --> 06:33.560
to sit down
with a sketch artist.

06:33.601 --> 06:35.937
- I just used every favor
I have with the DA.

06:35.979 --> 06:38.982
She's agreed to no jail time
if Tony's cooperation

06:39.024 --> 06:41.818
leads to the arrest of the--
- Bennett.

06:41.860 --> 06:43.069
- Bennett.

06:43.111 --> 06:45.071
Once Tony is discharged
from the hospital,

06:45.113 --> 06:47.198
he'll be released
into his father's custody,

06:47.240 --> 06:48.575
not the DCPD,

06:48.616 --> 06:50.410
but they cannot leave
the district.

06:50.452 --> 06:52.912
I know that there were
concerns before.

06:52.954 --> 06:55.081
Does anyone still have
a problem with this?

06:55.123 --> 06:56.583
- Tony's a kid.
If we can keep him

06:56.624 --> 06:58.043
out of jail
with adult criminals,

06:58.084 --> 06:59.127
it's worth the risk.

06:59.169 --> 07:00.337
That kind of trauma
can affect him

07:00.378 --> 07:01.713
for the rest of his life.

07:01.755 --> 07:04.174
- Sorry.
I can get protective

07:04.215 --> 07:05.258
and caught up in the law,

07:05.300 --> 07:08.303
but saving a life

07:08.345 --> 07:11.056
is worth taking any risk.

07:11.097 --> 07:12.807
[knocking]

07:14.142 --> 07:16.936
[quiet uneasy music]

07:16.978 --> 07:19.522
[knocking]

07:21.149 --> 07:23.151
- Away from the window.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.237
Get down.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.114
- [whimpering]

07:28.156 --> 07:30.742
- Hello?
I'm sorry for intruding.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.285
Can I just please
use your phone?

07:32.327 --> 07:36.039
I'm having car trouble,
and my cell died.

07:36.081 --> 07:37.374
- [sighs]

07:37.415 --> 07:44.673
* *

07:48.301 --> 07:50.679
[knocking]

07:53.723 --> 07:56.685
[tense music]

07:56.726 --> 08:03.983
* *

08:08.863 --> 08:11.700
- Tony, you can trust them.

08:14.202 --> 08:16.788
- Tony, can you tell us
about the person

08:16.830 --> 08:19.457
who roped you into all of this?

08:19.499 --> 08:22.127
- Anything you remember
from the night at the motel

08:22.168 --> 08:24.295
will help.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.922
- [echoing] I don't remember
that night.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.389
- You're safe, Tony.

08:34.431 --> 08:36.224
I promise.

08:36.266 --> 08:39.102
- I'm safe?
Okay.

08:39.144 --> 08:41.187
I'll tell you everything
I remember from that night.

08:41.229 --> 08:44.357
I remember you telling me
to trust you.

08:44.399 --> 08:47.402
Oh, and I also remember
you letting me get shot

08:47.444 --> 08:50.071
and putting me in a coma
for the past six weeks.

08:50.113 --> 08:52.866
- Son, I know how you feel, but
they're just trying to help--

08:52.907 --> 08:54.284
- I remember everything
you did, too,

08:54.325 --> 08:55.869
like giving me up
to these people, what,

08:55.910 --> 08:57.120
the day you met them?

08:57.162 --> 08:58.538
Or how about years back,

08:58.580 --> 09:00.040
when you broke our family apart

09:00.081 --> 09:01.041
and divorced Mom?

09:01.082 --> 09:02.667
- I have never done anything

09:02.709 --> 09:03.668
to intentionally hurt you--

09:03.710 --> 09:04.878
- Mom loved me.

09:04.919 --> 09:05.920
She believed in me.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.547
And you made her go away.

09:07.589 --> 09:08.715
- Tony, try to stay calm.

09:08.757 --> 09:09.716
You just got out
of the hospital.

09:09.758 --> 09:11.217
- [breathing heavily]

09:11.259 --> 09:12.552
- Oh, you--are you okay?

09:12.594 --> 09:13.553
- Tony, sit down, please.

09:13.595 --> 09:14.846
What's wrong?

09:14.888 --> 09:16.514
- I gotta throw up.
Those meds--

09:16.556 --> 09:18.016
- Around the corner
on the left.

09:20.310 --> 09:21.895
- Patrick, I know
that was hard to hear,

09:21.936 --> 09:23.605
but he doesn't mean
all of that.

09:24.189 --> 09:28.234
- Oh...

09:28.276 --> 09:30.862
What have I done?

09:30.904 --> 09:32.489
- Trust me, as a--

09:32.530 --> 09:34.115
as a kid who took a lot out
on his father

09:34.157 --> 09:35.992
after some things
happened to me,

09:36.034 --> 09:39.579
I can tell you he's just
processing and lashing out.

09:39.621 --> 09:42.415
- I've ruined his life.

09:42.457 --> 09:44.209
- You're saving Tony's life.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.920
We are going to find
who victimized your son,

09:46.961 --> 09:48.963
and while they rot in jail,

09:49.005 --> 09:51.466
Tony's gonna go to prom
and college,

09:51.508 --> 09:54.886
and one day, he's gonna have
his own family to protect

09:54.928 --> 09:57.263
as fiercely as you
protect yours.

09:59.391 --> 10:00.934
- Tony's gone.

10:06.022 --> 10:06.189
.

10:06.231 --> 10:07.357
- Could he have gone
to a friend's house?

10:08.566 --> 10:09.984
- Tony was antisocial.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.194
I don't think he had
any friends.

10:11.236 --> 10:12.946
- Any leads?
- No, nothing.

10:12.987 --> 10:14.030
If Tony had his phone,
we'd at least have

10:14.072 --> 10:15.407
something to track him by.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.117
But it's still in
evidence lockup.

10:17.158 --> 10:18.326
- I'm telling you, Tony
went to find his mom.

10:18.368 --> 10:19.953
It makes the most sense.

10:19.994 --> 10:20.954
- Well, he definitely sees her
as a fix for everything

10:20.995 --> 10:22.247
that's wrong in his life.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.040
- But problem is,
she's in the wind.

10:24.082 --> 10:25.875
- Carolyn Edwards is
remarried with kids,

10:25.917 --> 10:27.585
but she went underground
around the time news

10:27.627 --> 10:28.878
first broke
about Tony's involvement

10:28.920 --> 10:29.879
in Matthew's kidnapping.

10:29.921 --> 10:30.922
- Hiding with two kids

10:30.964 --> 10:32.257
can't be easy.

10:32.298 --> 10:33.717
She must have left
a trail somewhere.

10:33.758 --> 10:35.427
- She would have
eventually had to enroll

10:35.468 --> 10:36.761
the kids in a new school.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.346
Dhan, keep looking.
Try that angle.

10:38.388 --> 10:42.684
- Look, I know that no one
wants to consider this,

10:42.726 --> 10:46.938
but what if Tony
went back to Bennett?

10:46.980 --> 10:48.565
- Bennett already tried
to kill Tony once.

10:48.606 --> 10:50.734
I think he'd be too scared
to risk going back to him.

10:50.775 --> 10:52.193
- Even if his back
was against the wall?

10:52.235 --> 10:53.862
- Margaret, take
another run at Patrick.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.822
Maybe he's remembered
something else overnight.

10:55.864 --> 10:57.407
- Okay, on it.
- I'll keep trying

10:57.449 --> 10:59.034
to get into the system
for the street cameras

10:59.075 --> 11:00.535
in the area.
With all the police

11:00.577 --> 11:02.287
and media attention
on M&A right now,

11:02.328 --> 11:04.372
I have to be careful
how I hack into things.

11:04.414 --> 11:05.540
All eyes are on us.

11:05.582 --> 11:06.791
- If the police arrest Tony

11:06.833 --> 11:08.126
for reneging on the DA deal

11:08.168 --> 11:09.419
before we get to him,
he's screwed.

11:09.461 --> 11:11.379
If Bennett gets
to him, he's dead.

11:11.421 --> 11:12.756
- Where are you going?

11:12.797 --> 11:13.798
- To have a little chat
with Mallory.

11:13.840 --> 11:14.966
He needs to back off

11:15.008 --> 11:16.468
and tell
the media to do the same,

11:16.509 --> 11:17.927
so we can do our damn job.
- Wait, wait, wait.

11:17.969 --> 11:19.387
Don't piss Mallory off.

11:19.429 --> 11:21.097
He will only expedite
pulling our license.

11:21.139 --> 11:23.850
- She won't, because
I'll be there with her.

11:23.892 --> 11:26.061
- Trent--
- Save the arguments.

11:26.102 --> 11:27.604
I'm not doing you
any favors here.

11:27.645 --> 11:30.065
I heard you loud and clear
during Melissa's case.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.317
This is about Tony.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.694
I think we can both agree
that saving our victims' lives

11:34.736 --> 11:35.904
always comes first.

11:35.945 --> 11:41.451
* *

11:43.578 --> 11:46.122
- Captain Mallory.
- [exhales heavily]

11:46.164 --> 11:49.751
- I genuinely believe you
and I want the same things:

11:49.793 --> 11:51.378
to keep our community safe.

11:51.419 --> 11:54.005
Tony Edwards is not
one of the bad guys.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.257
What can I do to get you
to work with M&A

11:56.299 --> 11:58.468
to save his life,
instead of against us?

11:58.510 --> 12:00.136
- Look, the pressure
you are putting

12:00.178 --> 12:02.639
on M&A in the media,
the investigation

12:02.681 --> 12:03.932
into their license--

12:03.973 --> 12:04.974
it's all making
it hard for Gabi

12:05.016 --> 12:06.393
and her team to do their jobs.

12:06.434 --> 12:07.936
- The law is the law.

12:07.977 --> 12:10.438
Tony Edwards broke the law.
He should pay the price.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.273
If you've been listening
to the news,

12:12.315 --> 12:14.275
the majority of citizens
agree with that.

12:14.317 --> 12:15.944
- And what about
the other missing victims

12:15.985 --> 12:17.737
out there that need help
from a firm like M&A?

12:17.779 --> 12:19.406
- They'd have you,
if you'd just

12:19.447 --> 12:22.951
accept your job back and stop
flushing your career away.

12:26.162 --> 12:28.456
- I thought Trent
was still suspended.

12:28.498 --> 12:31.459
- I returned his badge back
after the Melissa Derr case.

12:31.501 --> 12:33.795
He's hesitating to accept
because he's too busy

12:33.837 --> 12:36.589
drinking the M&A Kool-Aid.

12:36.631 --> 12:38.466
Trent's a good cop.

12:38.508 --> 12:41.302
He's a rare kind of cop,
like his old man.

12:41.344 --> 12:42.887
And he's throwing it all away.

12:42.929 --> 12:45.890
[soft electronic music]

12:45.932 --> 12:48.309
For you.

12:48.351 --> 12:52.814
* *

12:52.856 --> 12:55.025
- Why didn't you tell me
you were offered your job back?

12:55.066 --> 12:56.985
- Let's just stay focused
on the missing child

12:57.027 --> 12:58.611
we have to find.

12:58.653 --> 13:01.614
* *

13:01.656 --> 13:03.658
- Has Matthew
gone missing again?

13:03.700 --> 13:06.411
- It's Tony this time.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.830
- Since when do we
help find criminals?

13:08.872 --> 13:10.749
- There is no we.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.542
And Tony is just
as much a victim

13:12.584 --> 13:14.002
in all of this as Matthew.

13:14.044 --> 13:16.671
- You
and your unrelenting naivete.

13:16.713 --> 13:21.968
- It's called empathy,
something you're incapable of.

13:22.010 --> 13:24.179
- And where is
your empathy for me?

13:24.220 --> 13:26.014
Why is it so easy for you
to see this Tony

13:26.056 --> 13:28.683
as worthy of redemption,
yet you refuse

13:28.725 --> 13:30.018
to see the humanity in me?

13:30.060 --> 13:31.603
- Because you have none.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.021
You kidnapped a child.

13:33.063 --> 13:34.898
- So did Tony.

13:34.939 --> 13:37.567
And you, dear Gabrielle...

13:37.609 --> 13:38.860
[chains clatter]

13:38.902 --> 13:40.278
Kidnapped a man.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.198
We've all committed
sins here, so why

13:43.239 --> 13:45.450
am I so unworthy of redemption?

13:45.492 --> 13:47.285
- Is that what you want?

13:50.622 --> 13:55.210
That is something
you will never get from me.

13:55.251 --> 13:56.961
It doesn't matter
how many people

13:57.003 --> 13:58.088
you help me save.

13:58.129 --> 13:59.839
Our sins are not equal,

13:59.881 --> 14:02.258
and you know why.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.810
- [knocks sharply]
It's okay. It's okay.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.603
I saw you earlier
through a crack.

14:13.645 --> 14:16.648
Are you okay?

14:16.690 --> 14:18.233
It's okay.
It's okay.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.777
The guy drove away.

14:20.819 --> 14:23.571
Do you need help?

14:23.613 --> 14:25.448
- You were the one
at the door before.

14:25.490 --> 14:26.741
Yes, please!
Yes, help me.

14:26.783 --> 14:28.201
- Okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:28.243 --> 14:29.452
I'm gonna get help.
- No, no, no, no.

14:29.494 --> 14:30.995
Please.
Don't leave me.

14:31.037 --> 14:32.080
- I have to.

14:32.122 --> 14:33.748
My cell is still dead.

14:33.790 --> 14:37.043
But I'm gonna come back
with people to get help, okay?

14:37.085 --> 14:39.713
- No, no, please.
- I promise.

14:39.754 --> 14:46.594
* *

14:47.971 --> 14:52.767
- So Dhan's a couple of minutes
out with Carolyn Edwards.

14:52.809 --> 14:55.311
- Brace for impact.

14:55.353 --> 14:56.938
- Gabi, you remember
Andrea Robinson,

14:56.980 --> 14:58.106
Matthew's mother.

14:58.148 --> 14:59.566
- Of course. Andrea, hi--

14:59.607 --> 15:00.900
- I saw on the news
you're taking on Tony

15:00.942 --> 15:03.278
as a client.

15:03.319 --> 15:04.779
He came to my house
an hour ago.

15:04.821 --> 15:06.114
- Is Matthew okay?
- Where's Matthew now?

15:06.156 --> 15:07.449
- Matthew's fine.

15:07.490 --> 15:09.117
He only saw him
through the window.

15:09.159 --> 15:10.452
Tony came to apologize
for everything he'd done,

15:10.493 --> 15:11.786
for what he put
Matthew through,

15:11.828 --> 15:12.912
and then just left.

15:12.954 --> 15:14.539
- He's on a redemption tour.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.375
- Andrea, Lacey's gonna take

15:17.417 --> 15:19.085
the rest of your statement,
if that's okay.

15:19.127 --> 15:22.922
Margaret and I
will be right back.

15:22.964 --> 15:24.799
- Have a seat on the couch.

15:24.841 --> 15:27.594
[suspenseful electronic music]

15:27.635 --> 15:29.637
- Do you have any other
family in Virginia,

15:29.679 --> 15:31.306
people Tony would go to?

15:31.348 --> 15:33.141
- No.
We're only there

15:33.183 --> 15:34.684
because things got

15:34.726 --> 15:36.227
so hostile, um,

15:36.269 --> 15:39.147
after the news broke
about Tony.

15:39.189 --> 15:40.732
- And you haven't been back?

15:40.774 --> 15:42.776
- I know you're judging me.

15:42.817 --> 15:43.985
- There is no judgment here.

15:44.027 --> 15:45.570
- I have two young children

15:45.612 --> 15:47.614
who are afraid
of their half-brother.

15:47.655 --> 15:49.366
And frankly, so am I.

15:49.407 --> 15:51.159
- So you've had
no contact with him?

15:51.201 --> 15:52.827
He hasn't called?

15:52.869 --> 15:54.788
- I haven't spoken to him.

15:54.829 --> 15:57.457
[quiet dramatic music]

15:57.499 --> 15:59.334
- You haven't actually
answered the question.

15:59.376 --> 16:02.754
- [breathing shakily]

16:02.796 --> 16:04.506
I got a voice mail from Tony.

16:04.547 --> 16:06.132
It had a number
I didn't recognize, but I--

16:06.174 --> 16:08.009
I haven't called him back.

16:08.051 --> 16:09.177
And I don't plan to.

16:09.219 --> 16:10.970
- Carolyn, you are

16:11.012 --> 16:13.181
our strongest lead
to find Tony.

16:13.223 --> 16:14.683
You need to call him back.

16:14.724 --> 16:16.518
- I love my son.

16:16.559 --> 16:19.521
But I have two terrified
children to protect,

16:19.562 --> 16:22.399
and they have
to come first now.

16:22.440 --> 16:27.362
- Would you like
some more tea or water?

16:27.404 --> 16:28.905
- There's someone back there
you don't want me

16:28.947 --> 16:31.533
to see or interact with.

16:31.574 --> 16:32.701
Who is it?

16:32.742 --> 16:36.371
I won't act a fool.
That's a promise.

16:36.413 --> 16:40.792
- It's, um,
Tony Edwards' mother.

16:40.834 --> 16:43.878
[tense music]

16:44.254 --> 16:45.880

16:55.598 --> 16:58.184
My son is the one yours took.

- Oh, my God.

17:01.104 --> 17:03.606
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

17:03.648 --> 17:06.026
- I forgive him.

17:06.067 --> 17:10.613
My God requires that of me,
and I require it of myself.

17:10.655 --> 17:12.907
I can't speak to why Tony
did what he did,

17:12.949 --> 17:15.994
but I can speak to him
showing up to my house,

17:16.036 --> 17:18.455
full of remorse,
and apologizing

17:18.496 --> 17:19.664
for the harm he caused.

I don't know what to--

17:27.255 --> 17:29.090
I don't know what to say.

17:29.132 --> 17:30.425
My boy was a good kid.

17:30.467 --> 17:32.761
He--
- I believe deep down,

17:32.802 --> 17:35.013
he probably still is.

17:35.055 --> 17:37.265
Remember, Carolyn, as mothers,
we aren't supposed

17:37.307 --> 17:38.641
to give up on our kids.

17:42.312 --> 17:43.646
- I'll make the call.

- Remember, stay calm,
follow my prompts.

- Yeah, Tony, it's me.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.330
- I'm so glad
you called me back.

18:00.372 --> 18:04.334
I was worried you hated me.

18:04.376 --> 18:06.461
- I could never hate you.

18:06.503 --> 18:09.422
- Mom, I never meant
to do any of this.

18:09.464 --> 18:11.591
- I know, Tony.
I know. I know.

18:11.633 --> 18:14.177
- Could I--could I come stay
with you for a while?

18:14.219 --> 18:18.139
I miss you and Emily
and Margo.

18:18.181 --> 18:20.517
- I just--I need
to understand.

18:20.558 --> 18:22.811
That boy you took, he's--
he's Emily's age.

18:22.852 --> 18:24.813
How could you do that?
How could you do that?

18:24.854 --> 18:26.189
- Please, Mom.

18:26.231 --> 18:27.399
I have nowhere else to go.

18:27.440 --> 18:30.610
I can explain everything.

18:30.652 --> 18:32.404
- It's not safe
for you to come home, Tony.

18:32.445 --> 18:33.947
I'm with Mosely and Associates.
They're looking for you.

18:33.988 --> 18:36.116
You need to find somewhere
else and stay safe, okay?

18:36.157 --> 18:38.118
[phone beeps]

18:38.159 --> 18:39.577
- What did you do?

18:39.619 --> 18:41.788
- I can't bring Tony
around my other children.

18:41.830 --> 18:44.416
Andrea said I can't just
give up on my child, either.

18:44.457 --> 18:45.500
I don't know who to trust.

18:45.542 --> 18:46.793
And the last time my son

18:46.835 --> 18:49.671
was in your custody,
he got shot!

18:49.713 --> 18:51.715
- If I had time,
I'd explain all of that,

18:51.756 --> 18:53.800
but time is the one thing
your boy doesn't have.

18:53.842 --> 18:56.553
And you just turned him
over to the wolves.

19:01.349 --> 19:01.558
.

19:01.599 --> 19:02.559
- I got a partial trace
on the call.

19:03.852 --> 19:05.437
It pinged three cell towers
near Brightwood.

19:05.478 --> 19:06.896
- That's where Tony's
high school is.

19:06.938 --> 19:08.815
- Tony didn't like school.
He barely had friends.

19:08.857 --> 19:10.316
I mean, there's no reason to
go back there, unless he--

19:10.358 --> 19:11.776
- He was in search
of another kid.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.236
Either to apologize,
like he did Matthew--

19:13.278 --> 19:14.821
- Or to grab
as an offer for Bennett,

19:14.863 --> 19:16.322
now that his back is really
up against that wall.

19:16.364 --> 19:17.407
- Wait, do we really think

19:17.449 --> 19:18.867
that Tony would risk

19:18.908 --> 19:20.201
apologizing to Matthew,
only to turn around

19:20.243 --> 19:21.411
and snatch another kid?

19:21.453 --> 19:22.912
- Lacey's right.
Tony feels

19:22.954 --> 19:24.539
like he failed
his mom and dad now.

19:24.581 --> 19:25.749
I was the same.
After my kidnapping,

19:25.790 --> 19:27.459
things were rough at home,

19:27.500 --> 19:28.960
between me and my dad,
especially.

19:29.002 --> 19:30.628
He didn't know how
to be there for me,

19:30.670 --> 19:32.172
and I didn't know
how to trust him.

19:32.213 --> 19:34.257
Even now, as adults,
our relationship sucks,

19:34.299 --> 19:36.092
but I'm still looking for ways
to make things right with him.

19:36.134 --> 19:38.094
Tony is probably
looking to do the same.

19:38.136 --> 19:40.430
That's what
his redemption tour is about.

19:42.307 --> 19:43.516
- Okay.

19:43.558 --> 19:44.976
Let's get
to the high school, then.

19:53.735 --> 19:55.612
- Dhan and Margaret are
still casing the perimeter.

19:55.653 --> 19:57.822
No sign of Tony yet.

19:59.366 --> 20:01.117
- Chloe Weller, principal.

20:01.159 --> 20:03.036
Ms. Mosely, I am such a fan.

20:03.078 --> 20:05.121
I heard you'd like access
to the campus?

20:05.163 --> 20:07.040
I'm assuming this is
about Tony Edwards.

20:07.082 --> 20:08.333
- Yes.
He's missing now,

20:08.375 --> 20:10.418
and we're helping
him and the family.

20:10.460 --> 20:11.836
- Of course.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.797
And I am beyond grateful
that you're on his side.

20:13.838 --> 20:16.216
No one seems to see
the good in these kids.

20:16.257 --> 20:17.967
Oh, I'm sorry.
I am gonna need

20:18.009 --> 20:19.469
to verify
your credentials first,

20:19.511 --> 20:21.429
since you're not parents
or faculty.

20:21.471 --> 20:23.973
I have a lot of parents
to answer to.

20:24.015 --> 20:28.144
* *

20:28.186 --> 20:30.689
- Hey, you good?

20:33.650 --> 20:35.151
- Your truancy records are--

20:35.193 --> 20:36.528
- Low for this area.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.196
In the five years
that I've been here,

20:38.238 --> 20:39.698
I've whipped this place
into something my students

20:39.739 --> 20:42.450
and staff can be proud of.

20:42.492 --> 20:43.993
Well, here we are.

20:44.035 --> 20:46.579
As I said, DCPD searched
Tony's locker thoroughly,

20:46.621 --> 20:48.331
but you're welcome to as well.

20:48.373 --> 20:50.250
- Well, we appreciate
your help.

20:50.291 --> 20:51.584
- Sure.

20:51.626 --> 20:57.173
* *

20:57.215 --> 21:02.512
[ethereal music]

21:02.554 --> 21:05.890
- [laughs]

21:07.559 --> 21:09.936
[camera shutter clicking]

21:11.521 --> 21:14.774
Tony had one like this
in his room at home.

21:14.816 --> 21:16.901
I thought you said
the police went through this.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.153
- They did.

21:18.194 --> 21:23.908
But I don't remember
this being here, though.

21:23.950 --> 21:26.202
- I mean, I wanted us
to be right, but--

21:26.244 --> 21:28.371
- Looks like Tony really
might be back in the game.

21:28.413 --> 21:29.748
- And it looks
like he was trying

21:29.789 --> 21:31.583
to recruit some kid, too.

21:31.624 --> 21:32.584
Finn Anderson?

21:32.625 --> 21:38.590
* *

21:40.175 --> 21:41.634
- Those texts are old.

21:41.676 --> 21:44.554
Like seven, eight months.

21:44.596 --> 21:45.972
- And you stopped responding?

21:46.014 --> 21:47.432
- Yeah.

21:47.474 --> 21:48.767
Got weird, man.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.810
- So after you stopped
texting back,

21:50.852 --> 21:52.145
did Tony try and groom you?

21:52.187 --> 21:53.563
- Wait, no.

21:53.605 --> 21:55.023
These texts aren't from Tony.

21:55.065 --> 21:57.442
- We found this phone
in Tony's locker.

21:57.484 --> 22:00.445
- You may have found it there,
but I wasn't texting with him.

22:00.487 --> 22:02.113
He'd be right next
to me in AP History

22:02.155 --> 22:04.157
when I was going back
and forth with that weirdo.

22:04.199 --> 22:05.700
We'd joke about it.

22:05.742 --> 22:09.245
- So does this weirdo
have a name?

22:09.287 --> 22:10.705
- Don't know.

22:10.747 --> 22:12.874
We met online
in a gaming chat room.

22:12.916 --> 22:14.751
They wouldn't reveal
their real identity

22:14.793 --> 22:17.087
unless I agreed to join
that trafficking thing.

22:17.128 --> 22:19.089
Which--forget that.

22:19.130 --> 22:22.967
I can't believe Tony
got sucked into that stuff.

22:23.009 --> 22:26.638
I feel bad for him.
A lot of us do.

22:26.680 --> 22:28.348
- Something
I'm not clear on:

22:28.390 --> 22:29.849
why would some stranger think

22:29.891 --> 22:31.726
you would even be open to this?

22:36.481 --> 22:38.066
- Things aren't good at home,

22:38.108 --> 22:40.402
and I've done
stupid stuff before.

22:40.443 --> 22:41.778
Acting out.

22:41.820 --> 22:43.571
Plus, this guy was really
good at selling

22:43.613 --> 22:45.156
what this new life
could be like.

22:45.198 --> 22:47.701
- So then
why didn't you fall for it?

22:47.742 --> 22:50.620
- Mr. Sawyer, my bio teacher.

22:50.662 --> 22:52.789
He kind of filled
that void in my life,

22:52.831 --> 22:56.251
got me engaged in school
and back on track.

22:56.292 --> 23:01.464
- This Mr. Sawyer paid
special attention to you?

23:01.506 --> 23:03.299
- Yeah, I--I guess.

23:03.341 --> 23:04.759
- Is he teaching today?

23:04.801 --> 23:07.470
[tense music]

23:07.512 --> 23:09.889
- [sighs]

23:13.935 --> 23:15.895
Gabi. Gabi!
Gabi, wait.

23:15.937 --> 23:17.772
You cannot just bust
in there and accuse

23:17.814 --> 23:19.399
this man of trafficking.

23:19.441 --> 23:20.900
M&A is in enough trouble
as it is.

23:20.942 --> 23:23.153
- Kids are sitting prey
for teachers like him.

23:23.194 --> 23:25.155
- I get why you
would think that way, I do,

23:25.196 --> 23:26.823
but this isn't the same.

23:26.865 --> 23:28.533
We don't even know anything
about this Sawyer guy yet.

23:28.575 --> 23:29.534
[school bell rings]
Gabi.

23:29.576 --> 23:31.036
Gabi, stop.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.328
Stop and think.

23:32.370 --> 23:34.497
- [breathes sharply]

23:34.539 --> 23:35.957
- Gabi, you okay?

23:35.999 --> 23:38.126
- I just--
I just need a minute.

23:38.168 --> 23:41.129
[dramatic music]

23:41.171 --> 23:43.173

23:43.214 --> 23:44.841
- All right, thank you.

23:44.883 --> 23:46.134
Patrick and Carolyn confirmed

23:46.176 --> 23:47.844
neither of them bought Tony
a car.

23:47.886 --> 23:48.928
- Just because this key
was in the duffel bag

23:48.970 --> 23:50.055
doesn't mean the car is here.

23:50.096 --> 23:51.890
- It's our only lead right now.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.433
Zeke, you see
anything up there?

23:53.475 --> 23:54.851
- No, nothing yet.

23:54.893 --> 23:56.394
[horn honks]
Wait.

23:56.436 --> 23:57.937
Click again.
[car horn beeps]

23:57.979 --> 24:00.357
Got it.
Next lot over, the faculty one.

[suspenseful music]

24:07.072 --> 24:07.906
* *

24:07.947 --> 24:09.532
- There's no parking permit

24:09.574 --> 24:11.201
or a visitor's pass.

24:11.242 --> 24:16.831
* *

24:16.873 --> 24:17.957
He wasn't driving this.

24:17.999 --> 24:19.793
Tony's like, what, six feet?

24:19.834 --> 24:21.211
I mean, the mirror
and the chair

24:21.252 --> 24:22.921
have been adjusted
for someone much shorter.

24:22.962 --> 24:24.214
- Read me the VIN number.

24:24.255 --> 24:25.548
- It's been scratched out,

24:25.590 --> 24:26.758
which means the plates
and registration

24:26.800 --> 24:28.051
are probably fraudulent, too.

24:28.093 --> 24:29.636
- Plug me
into the car's USB port.

24:29.678 --> 24:31.471
I can remotely hack
the car's computer

24:31.513 --> 24:33.223
and find the owner that way.
Hey, listen.

24:33.264 --> 24:36.351
It takes a while to upload,
so don't unplug me

24:36.393 --> 24:37.352
until I tell you.

24:39.312 --> 24:41.606
[school bell rings]

24:44.109 --> 24:45.777
- You sure they'll go for it?

24:45.819 --> 24:49.197
- Finn says students
have sympathy for Tony.

24:49.239 --> 24:50.824
We need help getting
the word out,

24:50.865 --> 24:53.076
and the media isn't
on our side for this one.

24:53.118 --> 24:54.494
Hi, everyone.

24:54.536 --> 24:55.912
My name is Gabi Mosely.

24:55.954 --> 24:57.872
Thank you for answering
Finn's summons.

24:57.914 --> 24:59.249
We just need
your help for a minute.

24:59.290 --> 25:01.042
- Can you tell us
what's going on now?

25:01.084 --> 25:02.085
- Of course.

25:02.127 --> 25:03.837
Studies show
that your generation

25:03.878 --> 25:06.423
is the most empathetic one
in history.

25:06.464 --> 25:09.426
- The world sees the crime
before the person,

25:09.467 --> 25:11.302
but not you.

25:11.344 --> 25:15.306
You see Tony as a person.

25:15.348 --> 25:18.184
- Tony is one of you.

25:18.226 --> 25:23.857
Have any of you
ever felt hurt or alone?

25:23.898 --> 25:28.069
- Now, someone took
advantage of Tony's pain.

25:28.111 --> 25:29.487
Made him do something horrible.

25:29.529 --> 25:30.697
- You have the power

25:30.739 --> 25:32.782
to help us find your classmate

25:32.824 --> 25:34.784
and show him
that he's not alone.

25:34.826 --> 25:38.747
Help us help him before
someone else gets hurt.

25:38.788 --> 25:40.331
- It's like no one
sees us as kids,

25:40.373 --> 25:42.959
not when we're poor
or minority or whatever.

25:43.001 --> 25:45.211
You don't get to make mistakes.

25:45.253 --> 25:49.257
I mean, shoot,
I could have been Tony.

25:49.299 --> 25:51.134
Someone could have taken
advantage of me,

25:51.176 --> 25:52.635
and nobody would've given me
the benefit of the doubt.

25:52.677 --> 25:55.555

to several students

26:13.907 --> 26:16.368
without my permission,
it's now all over the news

26:16.409 --> 26:19.662
that your license has been
officially revoked by DCPD.

to ask you to leave.

Damn it!

Yo guys,
what the hell happened?

26:47.899 --> 26:48.108
.

26:48.149 --> 26:49.150
- Look, Gabi Mosely
is impressive.

26:50.652 --> 26:52.278
She has essentially used
her trauma for purpose.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.114
Her trauma, her damage,
causes her

26:54.155 --> 26:56.866
to go too far and make
catastrophic mistakes,

26:56.908 --> 26:58.410
like helping
a known trafficker

26:58.451 --> 27:00.078
because he shares
similar trauma to her.

27:00.120 --> 27:01.496
And now we're hearing

27:01.538 --> 27:03.123
Tony Edwards might be
on the run.

27:03.164 --> 27:04.416
If he hurts
more innocent children,

27:04.457 --> 27:05.375
it's all on Gabi.

27:05.417 --> 27:07.168
She's no longer the solution.

27:07.210 --> 27:08.920
She's increasingly
becoming the problem.

27:15.051 --> 27:16.386
- Gabi, can we
show you something?

27:16.428 --> 27:17.971
- I just--
I just need a minute.

27:18.013 --> 27:21.391
- Too bad.
- Just trust us.

27:21.433 --> 27:24.394
- These incredible people,
or their loved ones,

27:24.436 --> 27:28.648
are here and alive because
of Gabi Mosely and her team

27:28.690 --> 27:30.358
at Moseley and Associates.

27:30.400 --> 27:33.194
I feel it's important
to hear directly from them.

27:33.236 --> 27:34.738
- Everyone just assumed

27:34.779 --> 27:36.531
I was a foster runaway,
and no one cared.

27:36.573 --> 27:38.491
Gabi not only figured out
who had me,

27:38.533 --> 27:40.660
she dragged me out
of the hole they left me in

27:40.702 --> 27:42.203
with her bare hands.

27:42.245 --> 27:46.291
I owe Gabi Mosely
and her team my life.

27:46.332 --> 27:49.961
- Same.
I was stalked and threatened,

27:50.003 --> 27:51.963
and Gabi wouldn't give up
the fight

27:52.005 --> 27:55.300
until she found my stalker
and gave me my life back.

27:55.342 --> 27:58.803
- She is the reason
I'm alive and sober today.

27:58.845 --> 28:02.349
She gave me my last moments
with my mom.

28:02.390 --> 28:04.476
- How did she track them
all down so quickly?

28:04.517 --> 28:06.519
- She may have had help
from a special intern.

28:06.561 --> 28:09.272

28:09.314 --> 28:13.610
- DCPD leadership, I beg you,
reinstate M&A's license.

28:13.651 --> 28:17.989
Our district is safer
and kinder because M&A exists.

28:18.031 --> 28:21.868
My son is home
because M&A exists.

28:21.910 --> 28:23.453
Do the right thing.

28:23.495 --> 28:26.206
- We'll be back
after the break.

28:26.247 --> 28:27.665

28:27.707 --> 28:30.835
#IAmTony is trending
across all platforms.

28:30.877 --> 28:33.713
Court of public opinion
is changing on him fast.

28:33.755 --> 28:35.465
- You did it, Gabi.

28:35.507 --> 28:36.716
- Wait.

28:36.758 --> 28:39.135
Margaret, shouldn't you be
at the station?

28:39.177 --> 28:41.221
- Um, per my--
my therapist's orders,

28:41.262 --> 28:45.767
I'm going in an hour later
tonight.

28:45.809 --> 28:47.894
- Baby steps.
I'm proud of you.

28:47.936 --> 28:50.563
- [chuckles]

28:50.605 --> 28:51.773
- Okay.

28:51.815 --> 28:53.400
I know the upload
didn't complete,

28:53.441 --> 28:55.443
but was there anything
from the car that was helpful?

28:55.485 --> 28:57.696
- Actually, what I
was able to restore

28:57.737 --> 28:59.114
from the partial upload

28:59.155 --> 29:01.074
was the car's
recent destination data.

29:01.116 --> 29:03.159
I'm cross-referencing it now

29:03.201 --> 29:05.912
with the high school's
directory, and...

29:05.954 --> 29:08.081
addresses belong
to current students.

29:08.123 --> 29:09.582
Mason Fontanesi,

29:09.624 --> 29:12.711
Blair Lieberman,
and Zaid Shokravi.

29:12.752 --> 29:14.045
- I recognize those names.

29:14.087 --> 29:15.964
They were
on the truancy report.

29:16.006 --> 29:18.008
- Who wants to bet money
that these kids

29:18.049 --> 29:20.885
weren't cutting school
voluntarily?

29:20.927 --> 29:22.429
- They were taken.

[suspenseful electronic music]

29:25.473 --> 29:27.434
- Hey.
So I had Shaker

29:27.475 --> 29:29.019
run checks on Sawyer
and other faculty

29:29.060 --> 29:30.311
after Finn's tip
earlier, right?

29:30.353 --> 29:32.480
- Is it him?
- Nothing on Sawyer.

29:32.522 --> 29:35.608
Something interesting came up
about Principal Chloe.

29:35.650 --> 29:38.445
Her last teaching gig was
in Boston five years ago.

29:38.486 --> 29:40.780
Her school there had
a high number of kids drop out

29:40.822 --> 29:43.950
and was in a neighborhood that
became known for trafficking.

29:43.992 --> 29:45.160
- Coincidence?

29:45.201 --> 29:46.828
- Coincidence my ass.

29:46.870 --> 29:49.622
She's using the schools
as a personal shopping ground,

29:49.664 --> 29:52.625
targeting bad kids
that no one will miss.

29:52.667 --> 29:54.711
- Except us.

and listen very carefully.

30:09.392 --> 30:11.394
We know you're behind
the trafficking ring.

30:11.436 --> 30:13.938
- I've dedicated my life
to helping these children.

30:13.980 --> 30:15.690
- What part of "shut up"
wasn't clear?

30:15.732 --> 30:17.317
- You groomed Tony,
and now he's ready

30:17.359 --> 30:18.735
to go on record
confirming that.

30:18.777 --> 30:20.737
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

30:20.779 --> 30:22.322
- Happy to clarify.

30:22.364 --> 30:24.491
Tony, you ready to tell DCPD

30:24.532 --> 30:26.618
exactly what Chloe did to you?

30:26.659 --> 30:28.995
- Okay, I'll tell you
everything that I remember.

- How could you?

30:36.628 --> 30:38.421
Parents trust you.

30:38.463 --> 30:40.298
- They should be thanking me.

30:40.340 --> 30:45.804
Those kids were screw-ups,
a blight on society.

30:45.845 --> 30:47.222
I did the world a favor.

30:47.263 --> 30:49.516
- A favor that was
very lucrative for you.

30:49.557 --> 30:51.309
This was just about the money.

30:51.351 --> 30:53.186
- Detective Shaker.

30:53.228 --> 30:55.855
Yeah, she's all yours.

30:55.897 --> 30:59.693
I'll have her detained
until you guys get here.

30:59.734 --> 31:01.069

31:01.111 --> 31:02.445
Cops will be here
in three minutes,

31:02.487 --> 31:04.197
which means you have
exactly one minute

31:04.239 --> 31:06.491
to tell me where you're holding
the other three missing kids,

31:06.533 --> 31:08.952
or I will stand here
and gleefully watch

31:08.993 --> 31:14.290
while Dhan breaks 72
of the 206 bones in your body.

31:19.045 --> 31:21.006

31:21.047 --> 31:22.757
But I refuse to go down alone.

31:26.886 --> 31:27.262

- Don't do this, man!
- You don't get to talk!

31:29.389 --> 31:31.141
- Ms. Mosely, help me.

31:31.182 --> 31:32.684
Tony took me
like he took Matthew.

31:32.726 --> 31:34.352
- That's not true!
- Tony, it's okay.

31:34.394 --> 31:35.687
We know the truth about Finn.

31:35.729 --> 31:37.439
Principal Chloe
told us everything.

31:37.480 --> 31:39.149
- Finn was the one
who shot me outside the motel.

31:39.190 --> 31:40.233
He's her accomplice.

31:40.275 --> 31:41.234
- We know, honey.

31:41.276 --> 31:42.944
Give me the gun.

31:42.986 --> 31:44.029
- He ruined my life.

31:44.070 --> 31:45.697
He was the one who--

31:45.739 --> 31:46.865
- Recruited you?

31:46.906 --> 31:48.533
We know you never tried
to groom Finn.

31:48.575 --> 31:50.452
- Principal Chloe
had to replace Finn

31:50.493 --> 31:53.455
before he graduated this year,
so he chose me.

31:53.496 --> 31:55.415
I hurt so many people.

31:55.457 --> 31:57.375
I knew there would be
more kids down here.

31:57.417 --> 31:58.710
I came to free them.

31:58.752 --> 32:00.462
- That's what
we're here for now.

32:00.503 --> 32:02.505
You don't need the gun anymore.

32:02.547 --> 32:03.506
You're not a killer.

32:03.548 --> 32:05.216
- No, I have to end this.

32:05.258 --> 32:06.468
- You're pathetic.

32:06.509 --> 32:08.261
- Tony, look at me.

32:08.303 --> 32:09.471
We have to save the kids.

32:09.512 --> 32:10.680
- They're in the back cage.

32:10.722 --> 32:12.057
- Dhan, Lacey, go get them.

32:12.098 --> 32:13.058
I'll stay with Tony.

32:13.099 --> 32:14.434

Dhan.

We're gonna get you
out of here, okay?

32:24.319 --> 32:26.529
Okay.

32:30.575 --> 32:32.577
Hi.

32:34.579 --> 32:40.210

free you from the trauma.

32:40.251 --> 32:41.503
Trust me, I know.

32:41.544 --> 32:43.963

after the hurt.

32:44.005 --> 32:45.674

with each life I save,

32:49.135 --> 32:53.014
I heal just a little more.

32:53.056 --> 32:56.393

You just saved
three lives today,

"To demand a uniformity
as related

38:19.466 --> 38:23.553
"to the application
of a discretionary punctuation

38:23.595 --> 38:25.096
is itself elitist."

38:25.138 --> 38:26.723
- [sighs]

38:26.765 --> 38:29.726
[tense music]

38:29.768 --> 38:37.025
* *

38:50.830 --> 38:52.665
What did you do?

38:52.707 --> 38:55.085
- Stopped her
from ruining our life.

38:55.126 --> 38:57.671
[Kendra Dantes'
"Dirty Hands" playing]

38:57.712 --> 38:59.297
- * Look in my eyes *

38:59.339 --> 39:00.924
* They lie *

39:00.965 --> 39:02.884
* Went to hell
a couple times *

39:02.926 --> 39:06.388
* Can't say I don't try,
I tried *

39:06.429 --> 39:08.848
* Now there's nowhere
left to hide *

39:08.890 --> 39:14.938
* Now it's done, I'm undone
everything that I've become *

39:14.979 --> 39:17.399
* Let me show you
my darkness *

39:17.440 --> 39:20.610
* It's dark, yeah *

39:20.652 --> 39:24.280
* I'm the joker,
I'm the devil

39:24.322 --> 39:28.118
* I'm a demon, I'm a rebel *

39:28.159 --> 39:29.911
- Principal Chloe
had to replace Finn

39:29.953 --> 39:31.454
after he graduated this year.

39:31.496 --> 39:32.747
- It wasn't the same
with Chloe drawing

39:32.789 --> 39:34.457
from the same well, but--

39:34.499 --> 39:38.003
- * I'm the devil,
I'm a demon, I'm a rebel *

39:38.044 --> 39:39.879
* I've gone mad *

39:39.921 --> 39:42.298
* Don't try to understand *

39:42.340 --> 39:45.468
* Now I fight
with dirty hands *

39:45.510 --> 39:48.346
- [breathing heavily]

39:50.306 --> 39:53.852
- How dare you abandon me
as if I am of no consequence?

39:53.893 --> 39:55.687
- You were my teacher!

39:55.729 --> 39:57.313
I trusted you!

39:57.355 --> 39:59.357
Parents trusted you!

40:02.027 --> 40:04.779
- Why are we
rehashing the past?

40:04.821 --> 40:06.156
- Because all this time,

40:06.197 --> 40:09.534
I thought I was just
one unlucky student,

40:09.576 --> 40:11.911
one kid with a bright future,

40:11.953 --> 40:13.747
not enough
parental supervision,

40:13.788 --> 40:15.331
that you took advantage of.

40:15.373 --> 40:19.169
But you took Annie
from the school, too.

40:19.210 --> 40:22.047
- [sighs]

40:23.715 --> 40:29.346
The woman with the red bow?

40:29.387 --> 40:31.598
That was Annie.

40:31.639 --> 40:34.225
She came back.

40:34.267 --> 40:36.227
She came back.

40:36.269 --> 40:43.318
* *

40:44.444 --> 40:46.738
I will find
where you buried Annie,

40:46.780 --> 40:50.909
and you will pay
for all the pain you caused.

40:50.950 --> 40:55.622
Annie is the last chapter
in this sick saga.

40:55.663 --> 40:59.793
Once I solve it, it's over.

40:59.834 --> 41:02.545
You hear me?

41:02.587 --> 41:05.131
Over.

41:05.173 --> 41:11.596
- Except you won't,
because I didn't kill her.

41:11.638 --> 41:15.517
- You can't manipulate me
with your lies anymore.

41:15.558 --> 41:18.061
Annie didn't just save herself.

41:18.103 --> 41:20.939
She came back
to that hell months later

41:20.980 --> 41:23.900
because she knew
you would strike again.

41:23.942 --> 41:26.653
She came back to save
your next victim,

41:26.695 --> 41:29.823
and it cost her her life.

41:29.864 --> 41:34.327
And for that,
I will make you pay.

41:34.369 --> 41:37.914
- * Don't try
to understand *

41:37.956 --> 41:41.251
* I'm the joker,
I'm the devil *

41:41.292 --> 41:43.920
* I'm a demon, I'm a rebel *

41:43.962 --> 41:45.922
* I've gone mad *

41:45.964 --> 41:48.925
* Don't try to understand *

41:48.967 --> 41:52.095
* Now I fight
with dirty hands *

42:04.441 --> 42:04.649
.

42:04.691 --> 42:05.150
[spacey music]

42:07.527 --> 42:14.576
* *

42:34.554 --> 42:36.181
- Greg, move your head.
