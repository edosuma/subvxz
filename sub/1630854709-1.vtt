THE WAY DRIVING SCHOOL

00:12.359 --> 00:14.115
I turned 18 last week.

00:14.199 --> 00:15.876
I really want to get my license.

00:15.960 --> 00:17.475
I've wanted to since I was little.

00:17.559 --> 00:19.115
I finished high school this year

00:19.199 --> 00:21.556
and I'd rather wait until next year
to go to university.

00:21.640 --> 00:24.960
Now I want to study English well
and get my driver's license.

00:25.399 --> 00:30.196
I live with my parents
and since they live far from everything,

00:30.280 --> 00:33.840
I need my license or I'd die of boredom.

00:34.240 --> 00:37.240
They ask for it at work.
If I want to work, I need it.

00:37.679 --> 00:40.600
I don't know, it's something
I've had pending for a while.

00:41.159 --> 00:43.119
Everyone needs a license, right?

00:44.119 --> 00:46.715
You haven't needed it until now?

00:46.799 --> 00:48.476
I didn't find the right time.

00:48.560 --> 00:51.916
Lots of guys and girls
just turned 18 come here

00:52.000 --> 00:53.635
and they're really keen.

00:53.719 --> 00:55.836
We have almost no one your age

00:55.920 --> 00:58.436
and they don't come
for fun but from obligation.

00:58.520 --> 01:00.640
Excuse me, is there
an age limit for this?

01:00.960 --> 01:03.799
You're not that old.
To get your license you are.

01:04.959 --> 01:08.036
Theory classes are Wednesdays.

01:08.120 --> 01:10.676
Can I sit for the theory
without coming to classes?

01:10.760 --> 01:14.435
It's not recommended,
but if you want to do it on your own...

01:14.519 --> 01:16.515
Yes, I'll do it on my own.

01:16.599 --> 01:17.995
Is this what I have to learn?

01:18.079 --> 01:20.916
Yes, but if you want to come
to a class or two,

01:21.000 --> 01:22.875
any student is welcome.

01:22.959 --> 01:24.715
I'm not a very good student.

01:24.799 --> 01:25.760
Why?

01:26.280 --> 01:28.280
- Because I'm a teacher.
- School?

01:29.879 --> 01:32.239
No, university.

02:08.719 --> 02:14.879
I DON'T LIKE DRIVING

02:18.439 --> 02:19.515
Yes?

02:19.599 --> 02:22.235
A tractor that hauls a trailer, what...?

02:22.319 --> 02:23.969
You can't do these things, Pablo.

02:24.520 --> 02:25.756
What things?

02:25.840 --> 02:28.115
<i>Call me at this hour.
What if I'm with someone?</i>

02:28.199 --> 02:30.876
- Are you with someone, Iria?
- No.

02:30.960 --> 02:32.835
A tractor that hauls a trailer,

02:32.919 --> 02:36.196
what maximum speed must it
not exceed outside of town?

02:36.280 --> 02:39.159
<i>I've never driven a tractor.
Look in the manual.</i>

02:40.360 --> 02:43.835
I am, but it's not here, I can't find it.

02:43.919 --> 02:46.876
<i>Did you call about the that
or to ask me to drive you?</i>

02:46.960 --> 02:49.759
I wasn't thinking of asking you,
but if you can...

02:50.240 --> 02:53.436
Okay, I'll drive you, but go to sleep.

02:53.520 --> 02:56.436
<i>And you start studying
the night before...</i>

02:56.520 --> 03:00.120
I found it! 25 km/hour.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.319
Are you nervous?

03:25.520 --> 03:27.320
It's more that I don't feel like it.

03:29.599 --> 03:30.879
You seem pretty cocky.

03:32.400 --> 03:34.996
Would you feel like sitting for an exam?

03:35.080 --> 03:37.879
I haven't sat for an exam in 22 years.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.515
Watching you it looks easy.

03:42.599 --> 03:45.876
I've been driving for many years.
I don't drive that well.

03:45.960 --> 03:49.835
- Yes, but you passed first time.
- The practical the second time.

03:49.919 --> 03:52.960
It's easy when you're 18.

03:53.520 --> 03:55.759
Everything's easy when you're 18.

04:01.199 --> 04:04.835
I'm thinking you could use this
to take what you have left at home.

04:04.919 --> 04:06.919
I have nothing left. I took it all.

04:07.360 --> 04:10.520
Well, I have a copy of the keys.
Shall I give them back?

04:11.120 --> 04:12.196
No, no, no.

04:12.280 --> 04:15.276
Keep them in case I leave mine inside.

04:15.360 --> 04:17.360
Okay, whatever you like.

04:17.720 --> 04:20.235
So we don't have to sign anything?

04:20.319 --> 04:21.240
Sign what?

04:22.040 --> 04:24.000
I don't know, the divorce.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.879
Pablo, we're not married.

04:30.959 --> 04:33.836
Didn't we sign something once
at the council?

04:33.920 --> 04:37.639
The residency register,
we signed the residency register.

04:40.800 --> 04:42.000
So that's it?

04:43.839 --> 04:45.120
That's it.

05:04.240 --> 05:05.720
Do you have class later?

05:07.639 --> 05:08.639
Yes.

05:09.560 --> 05:10.510
What are you doing?

05:13.839 --> 05:14.800
Pablo...

05:18.319 --> 05:20.480
Call me later and tell me.

05:21.600 --> 05:23.399
Now you're nervous, eh?

05:26.160 --> 05:27.560
Yeah, yeah.

05:33.199 --> 05:35.235
Alright, this sign indicates...

05:35.319 --> 05:36.720
Careful, there's a trap.

05:37.279 --> 05:39.759
"Limited parking time".

05:40.160 --> 05:42.916
Correct. Don't confuse it
with "parking prohibited".

05:43.000 --> 05:44.916
What distance must one keep

05:45.000 --> 05:47.250
on a 3-lane freeway
from the vehicle in front?

05:49.480 --> 05:52.079
Excuse me, can we go in now?

05:53.160 --> 05:56.240
- I'm going in, yes.
- I mean to do the exam.

05:56.759 --> 05:58.399
I'm doing the exam too.

05:59.600 --> 06:02.079
I thought you were the examiner.

06:22.560 --> 06:23.920
Lopetegui...

06:25.199 --> 06:26.480
What are you doing here?

06:28.279 --> 06:29.399
The same as you.

06:30.759 --> 06:32.079
I'm doing the exam.

06:33.879 --> 06:36.199
I imagine so.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.079
Don't you recognize me?

06:42.759 --> 06:44.199
You teach me at college.

06:46.879 --> 06:48.639
We shall start the exam.

06:49.079 --> 06:50.360
Cellphones off.

06:50.920 --> 06:53.476
I remind you that the duration
of the test is 30 minutes

06:53.560 --> 06:56.995
and the results will be published
on the Traffic Dept. website

06:57.079 --> 06:58.319
throughout the day.

06:58.839 --> 06:59.759
You may begin.

07:03.240 --> 07:04.800
You don't know who I am?

07:06.360 --> 07:07.716
No, sorry.

07:07.800 --> 07:11.435
It's alright, I'm new.
Maybe it's because I'm in first year.

07:11.519 --> 07:13.439
I'm very bad with faces, sorry.

07:14.240 --> 07:17.115
- My name's Yolanda.
- I'm worse with names.

07:17.199 --> 07:20.036
Are all the professors
at college this sullen?

07:20.120 --> 07:24.195
- Half don't know what 'sullen' means.
- Sullen, misanthropic, withdrawn, dour.

07:24.279 --> 07:26.716
A friend's picking me up,
we can take you.

07:26.800 --> 07:29.400
- No, thanks.
- We're going to college, it's nothing.

07:30.680 --> 07:32.716
I'm not going to college now.

07:32.800 --> 07:35.639
Yes, you are, you have a class
with me in under an hour.

07:41.560 --> 07:42.480
Lucy!

07:43.759 --> 07:45.519
- How did it go?
- Well...

07:46.240 --> 07:48.315
You go in front,
you'll be more comfortable.

07:48.399 --> 07:49.480
No, I'll go in back.

07:54.199 --> 07:56.759
Right, off to college.

07:58.600 --> 08:00.476
I blew an easy one.

08:00.560 --> 08:03.519
- How many mistakes can you make?
- Three and you fail.

08:04.680 --> 08:08.279
- Put the book away, don't stress out.
- Okay.

08:09.639 --> 08:11.759
And how did you do? Did you pass?

08:12.639 --> 08:13.836
I don't know.

08:13.920 --> 08:18.920
Hey... You're well into your 40s, right?

08:19.319 --> 08:21.675
- Hey, Lucy.
- What's wrong?

08:21.759 --> 08:23.956
Can't I ask how old he is?

08:24.040 --> 08:27.160
It's strange that a guy so old
wants to get his license.

08:27.480 --> 08:30.916
You're not so old, Lopetegui.
That's Basque. Are you Basque?

08:31.000 --> 08:32.116
No.

08:32.200 --> 08:34.200
But why do you want to get your license?

08:34.399 --> 08:37.356
- I want to get it.
- But why now?

08:37.440 --> 08:42.435
All your life to get your license,
and now in your 40s you get it?

08:42.519 --> 08:47.475
- Something must've happened.
- Right. Maybe he had it

08:47.559 --> 08:48.916
and lost it because of points.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.075
Because of fines, drunk driving.

08:52.159 --> 08:54.195
Did you lose your license
for drunk driving?

08:54.279 --> 08:57.879
I want to because if I had it,
I'd could've spared this conversation!

09:03.320 --> 09:05.120
Fuck, Lopetegui!

09:06.879 --> 09:08.876
You like to kid around, man.

09:08.960 --> 09:12.240
You're my kind, with ironic humor
that not everyone gets.

09:23.840 --> 09:26.000
Out you get, Lopetegui.

09:26.360 --> 09:29.120
- Thanks. See you shortly.
- Yes, see you.

09:31.159 --> 09:34.600
What's this Lopetegui like as a teacher?

09:35.799 --> 09:39.799
You know those who write a book
for a subject and make you buy it?

09:40.240 --> 09:42.200
Classic.

09:42.720 --> 09:44.795
I find him touching, I don't know why.

09:44.879 --> 09:48.279
Because it's touching to see a man
his age trying to get his license.

09:49.120 --> 09:50.080
That must be it.

09:50.679 --> 09:52.440
And because he's like your father.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.360
- No way.
- Yes.

09:54.720 --> 09:55.679
No.

09:58.240 --> 10:00.639
Spanish Literature in the 15th Century

10:01.759 --> 10:04.315
The Dantesque allegorical school.

10:04.399 --> 10:08.080
Enrique de Villena translated
Dante's "Divine Comedy"

10:08.639 --> 10:09.639
and began...

10:12.320 --> 10:13.360
Sorry.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.840
Sorry, sorry.

10:18.399 --> 10:21.120
As I was saying a current began...

10:22.159 --> 10:25.276
in the Spanish literary pre-Renaissance...

10:25.360 --> 10:26.440
What is it?

10:28.679 --> 10:29.639
Nothing, nothing.

10:34.039 --> 10:35.480
I passed.

10:46.039 --> 10:48.600
- The results are out already?
- Yes, they are.

11:03.639 --> 11:05.519
I don't have anything.

11:06.240 --> 11:07.320
Let's see.

11:10.639 --> 11:13.519
I don't know what to tell you,
mine's there.

11:27.559 --> 11:31.120
We'll leave it here for today
and continue next time.

12:26.320 --> 12:27.835
Now you're nervous.

12:27.919 --> 12:31.320
I'm not nervous about the exam,
but because the result's not out.

12:32.759 --> 12:35.675
<i>If you fail and have to
sit for it again, it's no big deal.</i>

12:35.759 --> 12:39.795
Yes, it is. I'll have a stroke
if I have to do it again.

12:39.879 --> 12:42.960
Studying manuals is so boring.

12:43.399 --> 12:45.955
That's what your college students say.

12:46.039 --> 12:47.240
Ha-ha-ha.

12:50.039 --> 12:51.236
Hold on.

12:51.320 --> 12:53.320
What, has it come out?

13:09.840 --> 13:13.636
Hello, Pablo. Congrats on
the theory. You're eligible.

13:13.720 --> 13:14.720
Thanks.

13:15.360 --> 13:17.356
Not everyone passes first time, do they?

13:17.440 --> 13:19.156
Well, almost everyone.
In fact, it's rare to fail.

13:19.240 --> 13:20.159
Sit down.

13:24.600 --> 13:26.636
Look, for the practical classes

13:26.720 --> 13:29.399
I've given you Lorenzo,
he's very patient.

13:30.360 --> 13:32.510
Is he a special instructor
for older people?

13:32.759 --> 13:34.435
With extra patience?

13:34.519 --> 13:38.116
When you sign up a bit older
you're a bit more awkward.

13:38.200 --> 13:41.276
Old and awkward. We've got it all.

13:41.360 --> 13:43.710
Well, you're more cautious,
which could be good,

13:44.039 --> 13:46.396
but since you're more aware
of the dangers,

13:46.480 --> 13:49.399
you're more scared, more nervous.
In short, awkward.

13:50.200 --> 13:52.759
Look, Lorenzo has a spot right now.

13:54.799 --> 13:55.720
Now?

13:56.519 --> 13:58.795
Don't get nervous, it's the first class.

13:58.879 --> 14:02.399
Lorenzo will only show you
the controls of the car, at most.

14:02.960 --> 14:04.399
Is now not good for you?

14:06.919 --> 14:09.799
THE WAY DRIVING SCHOOL
TRAINING DRIVERS SINCE 1985

14:16.919 --> 14:20.440
- Excuse me, can I get in?
- It's your car.

14:20.960 --> 14:24.200
You don't need my permission.
Get in your car when you like.

14:27.519 --> 14:29.876
- Lopetegui, Pablo, right?
- Yes.

14:29.960 --> 14:31.555
I've got you here. Good.

14:31.639 --> 14:33.675
Are they the most comfortable
shoes you have?

14:33.759 --> 14:36.799
If they are, you have to
always bring them to class,

14:37.519 --> 14:39.195
even to the exam.

14:39.279 --> 14:41.835
I don't mean you, I mean girls.
You know what they're like.

14:41.919 --> 14:44.356
They come to class in high heels,
it's unbelievable.

14:44.440 --> 14:47.835
Some even do the exam
in heels that look like stilts.

14:47.919 --> 14:52.435
I say this because in the first class
you don't drive with your hands,

14:52.519 --> 14:53.795
but with your feet.

14:53.879 --> 14:58.519
Repeat after me: "You don't drive
with your hands, but your feet".

15:00.320 --> 15:01.720
Go, no fear.

15:02.919 --> 15:04.916
You don't drive with
your hands, but your feet.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.356
Exactly, champ. A trained monkey
could handle the wheel.

15:08.440 --> 15:12.715
But can a monkey use the pedals?
No, no, it wouldn't reach.

15:12.799 --> 15:15.435
Maybe with stilts, yes.
But it doesn't matter,

15:15.519 --> 15:19.876
a monkey can't do the driving test
because it doesn't have ID.

15:19.960 --> 15:22.756
- Do you follow me so far?
- It has no ID.

15:22.840 --> 15:26.675
Exactly. Watch it, I don't mention
the stilts thing out of sexism.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.555
Some people take it badly.

15:28.639 --> 15:31.075
Maybe when I say "Stick your butt out",

15:31.159 --> 15:34.356
I mean the car's butt, not their butt.

15:34.440 --> 15:38.396
In here the only butt that
interests me is the vehicle's butt.

15:38.480 --> 15:42.396
You'll never hear me say:
"Women drivers, no survivors".

15:42.480 --> 15:45.636
Other sayings, yes.

15:45.720 --> 15:49.835
Like: "Behind a ball,
there's usually a kid".

15:49.919 --> 15:52.396
"Flush with the curb,
license in the bag".

15:52.480 --> 15:54.756
I say that a lot because
I like it, I like saying it.

15:54.840 --> 15:56.795
But why do I say these things?
Because they're true.

15:56.879 --> 15:59.555
"Women drivers, no survivors",
is that true? No.

15:59.639 --> 16:02.799
Some women drive well,
even better than some men.

16:03.960 --> 16:07.636
- Have we started the class?
- In here, Pablo, it's all the class.

16:07.720 --> 16:11.555
I don't just consider myself
a driving instructor, I'm an educator.

16:11.639 --> 16:12.879
What do you do?

16:14.120 --> 16:17.039
- I'm a teacher.
- Hey, we're colleagues.

16:19.960 --> 16:21.116
At university.

16:21.200 --> 16:22.955
And what you and I do, Pablo,

16:23.039 --> 16:26.675
is help the new generations
to prepare for the future.

16:26.759 --> 16:28.959
I don't know about "new generations".
I'm 45.

16:30.360 --> 16:32.795
- Who cares about that?
- Everyone, it seems.

16:32.879 --> 16:34.835
You take no notice.

16:34.919 --> 16:37.675
What's your future, Pablo? I'll tell you.

16:37.759 --> 16:40.396
Your future is
the practical driving test.

16:40.480 --> 16:42.356
And that's where I'm going to help you.

16:42.440 --> 16:44.690
Because the second lesson
I'll give you today:

16:44.919 --> 16:47.960
I won't teach you how to drive.
No, that's not my job.

16:49.240 --> 16:50.876
That's not my job.

16:50.960 --> 16:52.036
So...?

16:52.120 --> 16:54.916
I'm going to teach you
how to pass a test.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.075
When you've passed that test
and you're holding your license,

16:58.159 --> 17:00.876
that's when true learning will begin.

17:00.960 --> 17:02.516
Let's do the controls class.

17:02.600 --> 17:03.559
Go on.

17:06.160 --> 17:07.240
Low beam.

17:08.759 --> 17:09.839
High beam.

17:10.440 --> 17:12.279
Left indicator.

17:13.759 --> 17:15.960
Right indicator.

17:16.960 --> 17:17.920
Seat.

17:19.319 --> 17:20.480
Mirrors.

17:23.359 --> 17:24.599
And belt.

17:31.039 --> 17:32.000
Is all that clear?

17:32.680 --> 17:35.356
- A bit fast, but yes.
- Right then.

17:35.440 --> 17:37.435
We're going, let's start her up

17:37.519 --> 17:39.440
and hit the street.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
What?

17:41.359 --> 17:42.876
We're going for a spin.

17:42.960 --> 17:45.715
But don't do what a student
of mine, Javier, did.

17:45.799 --> 17:48.435
The examiner tells him "hit the street"

17:48.519 --> 17:52.156
and good old Javier opens
the car door and gets out.

17:52.240 --> 17:53.316
How about that?

17:53.400 --> 17:55.515
No, no, no, no, no...

17:55.599 --> 17:58.435
The secretary said today's class
was just on the controls.

17:58.519 --> 18:00.796
The sooner we liven up
the vehicle, the better.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.275
Don't be scared, Pablo. Relax. You relax,

18:03.359 --> 18:04.435
relax, relax.

18:04.519 --> 18:07.000
I've got pedals too, see?
Look, I have pedals.

18:07.599 --> 18:10.195
What do you drive with,
your hands or your feet?

18:10.279 --> 18:13.435
- Sure, sure. With your feet.
- That's right. We saw that.

18:13.519 --> 18:15.755
So, relax. Relax and let's do it.

18:15.839 --> 18:17.000
Start up the car.

18:26.680 --> 18:29.680
That's for a student of mine

18:30.000 --> 18:32.836
who gets "nervouth" in the classes

18:32.920 --> 18:36.160
and he only calms down
by listening to this music.

18:36.559 --> 18:40.076
I tell him they won't let him
put music on in the test,

18:40.160 --> 18:43.400
but he says he'll convince the examiner.

18:46.400 --> 18:49.119
If it's no good for you,
we'll turn it off, fine.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.675
Let's do the three steps.

18:51.759 --> 18:52.799
Step on the brake.

18:53.480 --> 18:54.636
In the middle, right?

18:54.720 --> 18:56.970
Yes, in the middle.
We take off the handbrake.

18:59.480 --> 19:02.916
Now we step on the clutch
as if you've seen a cockroach.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.796
Step on that cockroach, step on it.

19:04.880 --> 19:07.195
Firmly. The cockroach is getting away.

19:07.279 --> 19:08.876
Pablo, more firmly.

19:08.960 --> 19:12.119
Now we put it in first,
you know, to you and up.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.916
That's it. Now, very slowly,

19:16.000 --> 19:17.916
very gently, very gently,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.116
gently, gently, gently,
I'm an old guy, that's it,

19:20.200 --> 19:23.316
until you find the vibrato.
The car has vibrato.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.076
Hear it? Hear the vibrato?

19:25.160 --> 19:27.876
Now, what is the car telling you?
What's it telling you?

19:27.960 --> 19:29.755
"Accelerate me, or I won't go".

19:29.839 --> 19:32.556
Let's go, accelerate.
Brake off and we accelerate.

19:32.640 --> 19:34.396
That's it, that's it.

19:34.480 --> 19:35.556
That's it.

19:35.640 --> 19:38.316
The car is stupid. It won't do
anything you don't tell it to do.

19:38.400 --> 19:41.235
Now, if you're "nervouth",
the car can tell.

19:41.319 --> 19:43.275
That's it, easy and for the whole family.

19:43.359 --> 19:46.076
I'll end up being more handsy
with you than with my wife.

19:46.160 --> 19:48.156
Buy me a drink later, eh, sweetie?

19:48.240 --> 19:50.356
Yes, there it is. There we go.

19:50.440 --> 19:53.076
Let's go to second, first is worn out.

19:53.160 --> 19:54.836
We go to second. Accelerate.

19:54.920 --> 19:56.435
Clutch, the cockroach. I'll help you.

19:56.519 --> 19:58.396
We go to second and accelerate.

19:58.480 --> 20:01.515
We accelerate, accelerate.
We're out, there it is.

20:01.599 --> 20:03.755
Look, my brother-in-law
lives on that street.

20:03.839 --> 20:06.639
If I see him cross, I'll tell you
and you accelerate, eh?

20:18.680 --> 20:22.356
Now watch the curve.
Don't hit the curb. That's it.

20:22.440 --> 20:23.839
That's it, that's it.

20:24.440 --> 20:28.559
We have a red light.
When the light's red, we have to...

20:30.240 --> 20:32.116
- Stop.
- Stop, exactly.

20:32.200 --> 20:33.515
Good, let's go. Three steps.

20:33.599 --> 20:37.160
First, brake, shoe weight only.
Gently, shoe weight. We go to...

20:37.880 --> 20:40.916
That's it, the cockroach.
All the way down, all the way.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.316
And now we stop, now. Here.

20:44.400 --> 20:46.755
We go to neutral. Neutral.

20:46.839 --> 20:48.920
We can rest our foot the riser.

20:49.240 --> 20:50.359
That's it.

20:50.799 --> 20:52.640
So, professor, how's it going?

20:54.079 --> 20:55.960
- It's all very fast.
- Okay.

20:56.319 --> 20:58.796
We're going to indicate
to others that we're turning left.

20:58.880 --> 21:00.680
Put on the indicator.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.035
That way?

21:03.119 --> 21:06.556
Yes, your standard left.
The traditional, the usual.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.636
No, no, if we go that way
I'll get on the Atocha roundabout.

21:09.720 --> 21:11.596
Good, professor. Very good.

21:11.680 --> 21:13.116
It's good that you know
where the streets are,

21:13.200 --> 21:17.515
these days with that darn GPS
nobody knows where anything is.

21:17.599 --> 21:20.995
I know them all. True, my first job

21:21.079 --> 21:22.556
was driving my dad's taxi.

21:22.640 --> 21:25.680
I'd be with that
huge Madrid street guide,

21:26.000 --> 21:29.039
looking and looking,
and suddenly one day I said:

21:29.759 --> 21:32.675
"I'm not using the guide anymore".
I knew all of them.

21:32.759 --> 21:37.275
I even know what some of them
were called before. So, if I say

21:37.359 --> 21:39.876
José Antonio Avenue
or Generalísimo Avenue,

21:39.960 --> 21:42.836
don't think I'm being nostalgic,
eh, professor?

21:42.920 --> 21:45.759
I was a taxi driver,
it's not the same thing.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.400
Let's go. Careful...

21:51.359 --> 21:52.435
It's fine.

21:52.519 --> 21:56.356
In the test you can stall
up to three times

21:56.440 --> 21:58.356
and they don't fail you.

21:58.440 --> 22:01.116
In fact, if a student of mine
gets stalled,

22:01.200 --> 22:04.319
I tell the examiner "Just like me,
I stalled this morning".

22:09.119 --> 22:10.640
Let's do it.

22:12.480 --> 22:15.880
"Try to start it up, Pablo,
for God's sake, try to start it up".

22:17.160 --> 22:18.359
You know, the...?

22:20.000 --> 22:21.319
Let's go, professor.

22:21.680 --> 22:22.599
Come on.

22:23.400 --> 22:25.675
We go out slowly.

22:25.759 --> 22:27.316
Gently, gently, gently.

22:27.400 --> 22:28.319
That's it.

22:34.920 --> 22:37.596
No, no, no, no. I'm not going in there.

22:37.680 --> 22:40.596
Relax, it takes patience.
We'll get in a good situation.

22:40.680 --> 22:42.515
That's it.
Let's get properly in position.

22:42.599 --> 22:43.755
Relax.

22:43.839 --> 22:45.955
Don't get away.

22:46.039 --> 22:48.316
That's it, that's it. Help the car.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.519
Help the car. That's it, relax.

22:50.960 --> 22:52.675
- Careful, careful.
- Well!

22:52.759 --> 22:55.035
Not too close to the roundabout.
Focus, focus.

22:55.119 --> 22:56.195
- Step on...
- What?!

22:56.279 --> 22:58.799
No, calm, professor.
Don't mess with people.

22:59.119 --> 23:01.715
That's it. Hang in there. Don't get away.

23:01.799 --> 23:02.876
Don't get away.

23:02.960 --> 23:05.636
- I'm doing it!
- Take no notice, relax.

23:05.720 --> 23:07.715
Don't get too close, don't get too close,

23:07.799 --> 23:09.275
you'll bump the other guy.

23:09.359 --> 23:10.876
- That's it. Like that.
- What?!

23:10.960 --> 23:14.599
No, don't let go of the wheel.
This is a dance.

23:30.079 --> 23:32.195
We're going to park.
There's a space there.

23:32.279 --> 23:33.515
Step on the cockroach.

23:33.599 --> 23:34.995
Watch the... No, no, no, no.

23:35.079 --> 23:37.995
Relax, relax. That's it, that's it.

23:38.079 --> 23:39.715
That's it. Hold it.

23:39.799 --> 23:41.356
Relax.

23:41.440 --> 23:42.359
That's it.

23:43.599 --> 23:46.435
Gear off, clutch off,

23:46.519 --> 23:47.519
handbrake.

23:48.079 --> 23:50.556
We totally immobilize the car.

23:50.640 --> 23:53.235
Done. That's it, professor.

23:53.319 --> 23:55.469
It's all about starting
and dispelling fear.

23:55.599 --> 23:57.599
Until the next class.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.119
You didn't...

24:13.039 --> 24:15.396
You didn't ask me why
I want to get my license.

24:15.480 --> 24:18.156
That's silly. Everyone wants
to get their license.

24:18.240 --> 24:20.640
Driving is the most beautiful thing
in the world.

24:23.799 --> 24:24.916
See you later.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.759
Don't forget to bring
the same shoes to the next class.

24:29.440 --> 24:31.000
Yes, yes, good.

24:36.559 --> 24:37.559
Lopetegui!

24:40.720 --> 24:42.556
Relax, I'm not stalking you.

24:42.640 --> 24:45.316
It's closest driving school
on the way to college.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.156
Yes, for all of us.

24:47.240 --> 24:49.160
Who's teaching you?

24:50.720 --> 24:51.960
Lorenzo.

24:52.359 --> 24:53.755
Oh, me too.

24:53.839 --> 24:56.356
Isn't he funny?
I had some laughs with him.

24:56.440 --> 24:57.675
He's not just an instructor.

24:57.759 --> 24:59.515
- He's an educator.
- Yes.

24:59.599 --> 25:00.519
Lopetegui!

25:01.200 --> 25:03.755
Your book has run out
at the college bookshop.

25:03.839 --> 25:05.035
Which one?

25:05.119 --> 25:07.720
What else? The one you
make us buy for the subject.

25:09.240 --> 25:11.116
You'll find it on the Internet, for sure.

25:11.200 --> 25:12.675
To buy it, eh?

25:12.759 --> 25:15.435
At home, downloading a book
is a mortal sin.

25:15.519 --> 25:18.275
I have no intention at all
of despoiling you.

25:18.359 --> 25:22.035
You speak strangely.
Girls your age don't say "despoil".

25:22.119 --> 25:23.596
Well, I do it loads.

25:23.680 --> 25:25.319
Say it, not do it.

25:26.480 --> 25:28.675
You think it's bad that
I tell you to buy my book, right?

25:28.759 --> 25:30.356
It happens to me every year.

25:30.440 --> 25:31.955
Then why do you do it?

25:32.039 --> 25:35.916
Because 15th century Spanish literature
hasn't changed in the last 600 years,

25:36.000 --> 25:37.715
and if nothing's changed in 600 years,

25:37.799 --> 25:40.876
I don't know why I have to
teach classes differently every year.

25:40.960 --> 25:44.316
Yes, but limiting yourself
to reading the book...

25:44.400 --> 25:47.755
Would you like me to be
a cool professor, like in the movies?

25:47.839 --> 25:50.515
To recite poems up on a desk
and teach in the forest?

25:50.599 --> 25:52.316
Don't get it wrong, I'm your professor,

25:52.400 --> 25:55.200
you're my students, that's all.

25:56.319 --> 25:57.995
Not in the driving school.

25:58.079 --> 26:00.000
Here we both are students.

26:04.759 --> 26:06.235
Ciao, Lopetegui.

26:06.319 --> 26:07.240
Ciao.

26:20.000 --> 26:20.920
Hey, Pablo.

26:21.279 --> 26:22.359
How are you, Ramón?

26:23.240 --> 26:25.200
Your father is sorely missed.

26:25.680 --> 26:27.319
I'm awful sorry.

26:27.799 --> 26:28.876
Thanks a lot.

26:28.960 --> 26:30.596
You'll want to sell the car, right?

26:30.680 --> 26:32.995
Your dad looked after it
like it was made of gold, but...

26:33.079 --> 26:37.079
a car that old, if it doesn't move
it ends up as scrap.

26:37.519 --> 26:38.755
Right.

26:38.839 --> 26:40.515
No, I wasn't thinking of selling it.

26:40.599 --> 26:41.920
Oh, but do you drive?

26:42.839 --> 26:44.559
I'm getting my license.

26:45.759 --> 26:47.240
Shit, at your age?

26:51.400 --> 26:52.799
See you soon, Ramón.
