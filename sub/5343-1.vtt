When you go
to the haunted house
at Camden Park...

00:52.422 --> 00:54.323
<i>You don't know
what will happen.</i>

00:57.827 --> 00:59.194
<i>Camden Park!</i>

01:07.504 --> 01:09.538
National Retail Federation
does a poll

01:09.539 --> 01:11.974
and they say
21% of the people,

01:11.975 --> 01:13.976
that's 30
million people a year,

01:13.977 --> 01:15.911
are gonna go to
haunted houses.

01:15.912 --> 01:18.247
For a actor
in a haunted house

01:18.248 --> 01:20.849
there is no bigger rush
than getting a great scare.

01:20.850 --> 01:23.819
And it could be the biggest,
baddest guy in class
that comes through

01:23.820 --> 01:25.821
that you give that to.

01:25.822 --> 01:27.756
One year,
I think they had, like,
close to 1,200 scare-outs,

01:27.757 --> 01:30.159
where people walk in the door
and halfway through
they said,

01:30.160 --> 01:30.359
"I can't do this anymore,
I'm out, I want out."

01:37.567 --> 01:39.068
Oh...!

01:39.069 --> 01:40.836
- I love Halloween.
- Really?

01:40.837 --> 01:44.273
If I can get you to scream,
then I feel great.

01:44.274 --> 01:47.343
Yeah, I've heard rumors of
people doing things like that.

01:47.344 --> 01:49.645
Yeah.
- Supposedly hiring,
you know, actual...

01:49.646 --> 01:53.082
You know, murderers
or something to work
in their haunts.

01:53.083 --> 01:55.217
Things like that,
it's all talk sometimes.

01:55.218 --> 01:57.553
There really is.
I'll show you.
Inside the house,

01:57.554 --> 01:59.254
there's real human remains

01:59.255 --> 02:00.956
inside the haunted house.

02:00.957 --> 02:03.459
Some of the actors
that we have are,
they're pretty far out there.

02:03.460 --> 02:04.760
Would it surprise me
if something happened?

02:06.162 --> 02:07.629
No.

02:16.840 --> 02:19.575
<i>A Missouri house of horror
became a reality.</i>

02:19.576 --> 02:21.810
<i>Police report
that a 17-year-old employee...</i>

02:24.147 --> 02:25.447
<i>The owner said customers</i>

02:26.649 --> 02:29.351
<i>walked by her thinking
it was part of the show.</i>

02:29.352 --> 02:31.453
I do not want you
all filming in here.

02:31.454 --> 02:34.690
<i>Tonight a 28-year-old
registered sex-offender</i>

02:34.691 --> 02:37.092
<i>was arrested
at his work place,</i>

02:37.093 --> 02:39.028
<i>a Halloween haunted house.</i>

02:39.029 --> 02:42.164
<i>There was a scare
actor that was employed,</i>

02:42.165 --> 02:44.433
<i>slashed his
whole damn family...</i>

02:44.434 --> 02:45.768
<i>Father and mother and sister,</i>

02:45.769 --> 02:46.301
<i>in real life.</i>

03:12.062 --> 03:12.461
Get her in the trunk.

04:15.592 --> 04:17.392
This place is great.

04:23.800 --> 04:24.967
- Dude!
- What's up, man?

04:24.968 --> 04:26.001
Good to see you.

04:27.504 --> 04:28.704
Hi!

04:28.705 --> 04:29.805
What's up, brother?

04:29.806 --> 04:30.873
How you all been?

04:30.874 --> 04:32.207
- Bobby?
- Yes.

04:33.576 --> 04:34.910
Mike,
You've already taken over?

04:34.911 --> 04:36.245
How do you feel that I...

04:36.246 --> 04:38.213
How do you drop five
minutes in the trip?

04:38.214 --> 04:40.249
How do you
feel about me being
the better looking brother?

04:40.250 --> 04:42.084
- Zack?
- Yo.

04:42.085 --> 04:43.619
- What's up?
- If he's with us on this trip
I will kill myself.

04:43.620 --> 04:45.487
Tell me about yourself
and what are we doing?

04:45.488 --> 04:46.955
Zack, I'm talking to you.

04:46.956 --> 04:48.390
I think
she's transfixed by Jeff.

04:48.391 --> 04:49.258
You want my name?
My name is Zack.

04:51.261 --> 04:53.028
You've known me
for 20 years, Mikey.

04:53.029 --> 04:55.164
We've rented an RV.
We're going across...

04:55.165 --> 04:56.932
Well, the point is
I want to find the most

04:56.933 --> 04:58.634
extreme haunted house
in the world.

04:58.635 --> 04:59.802
Lady's gonna teach
him how to line dance.

04:59.803 --> 05:01.136
- Congratu-fucking-lations.
- Hey, hey, hey.

05:01.137 --> 05:03.972
Tell me
about you, Brandy.
- Uh...

05:03.973 --> 05:06.041
My name is Brandy
Catherine Shaefer.

05:06.042 --> 05:08.010
Jeffery Bernard Larson.

05:08.011 --> 05:09.845
Jeffery Bernard Larson.
Remember that.

05:09.846 --> 05:11.213
All right, Bobby.

05:11.214 --> 05:12.414
You're my big brother.

05:12.415 --> 05:14.082
I'm the one who
went to film school,

05:14.083 --> 05:15.717
so I deserve to carry
this camera for a bit.

05:15.718 --> 05:17.820
- You didn't graduate.

05:17.821 --> 05:19.087
Did you?

05:19.088 --> 05:19.988
This is
where I wanna go.

05:22.025 --> 05:23.091
Yeah, but this
is just a clip of a girl
being strapped.

05:23.092 --> 05:24.159
Did you watch the video?

05:24.160 --> 05:25.494
No.

05:25.495 --> 05:27.196
You're not gonna like it.

05:27.197 --> 05:30.599
I'm pretty sure
it's not that scary
if it's on the World Wide Web.

05:30.600 --> 05:31.867
Mike,
so you're down now?

05:31.868 --> 05:34.369
Yeah, I'm in, man,
like they said there...

05:34.370 --> 05:37.206
I've heard people talk
about the ones
that in New York,

05:37.207 --> 05:40.542
they zip tie you to a chair...
Stop it.

05:40.543 --> 05:43.979
Bags over the head,
that kind of thing.
That's a different story.

05:43.980 --> 05:46.348
It's just like the movies,
it's like...
It's the same thing.

05:46.349 --> 05:48.684
It's changed.
Jaycees haunted
house is in the '60s.

05:48.685 --> 05:51.553
You walk around and guys
jumped out and said, "Boo."

05:51.554 --> 05:53.121
That doesn't cut it anymore.

05:53.122 --> 05:54.890
When you were little,
going through haunted houses

05:54.891 --> 05:56.859
you didn't know if it
was real or not, right?

05:56.860 --> 05:59.995
That element,
what that feels like,
I wanna find it again.

05:59.996 --> 06:02.431
Be on time to the RV.

06:02.432 --> 06:04.233
Everyone's looking at Mikey.

06:04.234 --> 06:06.702
I was staring in
this direction.
Be on time.

06:06.703 --> 06:08.270
All right. Cheers!

06:08.271 --> 06:09.538
Happy Halloween!

06:09.539 --> 06:11.440
First night to
the haunted house.

06:19.182 --> 06:22.017
Put me down.

06:23.152 --> 06:25.053
What are you guys up to?

06:25.054 --> 06:26.955
We're going to
as many houses as we can
all across America.

06:33.129 --> 06:34.463
Where
the hell did you get that?

06:34.464 --> 06:35.664
Motherfucker!

06:39.535 --> 06:42.037
Is there anything
that's even scared you?

06:42.038 --> 06:45.507
I remember a haunt
I went to probably
three, four years ago.

06:45.508 --> 06:48.810
There was a guy on the floor,
he was munching
his teeth at me.

06:48.811 --> 06:51.380
And I looked at him
and he had
entrails behind him.

06:51.381 --> 06:53.382
So he was a paraplegic
they hired.

06:53.383 --> 06:55.951
He was real fast on his hands
and I thought
that was the most

06:55.952 --> 06:56.952
scariest thing I've ever seen.

06:58.254 --> 06:59.621
So how do you find people?

06:59.622 --> 07:01.490
A lot of people
are word of mouth

07:01.491 --> 07:03.525
and a lot of people
have worked for us
for many years,

07:03.526 --> 07:04.693
and they bring their friends

07:04.694 --> 07:06.662
and then we also put
ads in the Greensheet

07:06.663 --> 07:08.730
and the local newspapers.

07:08.731 --> 07:10.399
And we try to
recruit that way too.

07:10.400 --> 07:12.668
Do you do
like a background check
on people?

07:12.669 --> 07:15.837
You know currently we
do not do a background check.

07:15.838 --> 07:17.873
But we're looking into
doing that in future.

08:00.016 --> 08:01.783
- Fuck, bro!
- Come on man.

08:01.784 --> 08:02.951
What the fuck
are you doing here?

08:02.952 --> 08:04.052
Why didn't you just call me?

08:04.053 --> 08:05.120
What are you doing here?

08:05.121 --> 08:07.222
I went out last night.
Had a good time.

08:07.223 --> 08:09.024
Then I came here on time.

08:09.025 --> 08:10.859
You've never been on time
for a fucking thing
in your life.

08:10.860 --> 08:12.728
Now I'm on time
'cause I was
here hours before.

08:12.729 --> 08:14.096
Just be quiet.

08:14.097 --> 08:15.530
Why do I need to be quiet?

08:15.531 --> 08:17.432
I need you serious,
from here on out.

08:17.433 --> 08:18.834
Gonna be serious from...
In about a minute from now.

08:21.938 --> 08:23.238
Why in a minute?

08:23.239 --> 08:24.306
Say hi.

08:24.307 --> 08:24.606
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:26.242 --> 08:27.876
High-five?

08:32.715 --> 08:33.948
Why is it upside down now?

08:33.950 --> 08:34.482
Flip it.

08:35.818 --> 08:37.452
We gotta get some
fucking food, man.

08:37.453 --> 08:38.787
I want coffee.

08:38.788 --> 08:40.188
- Morning.

08:40.188 --> 08:41.256
Ladies.

08:41.256 --> 08:42.424
What's up, son?

08:43.793 --> 08:45.494
- Hi!
- Haunted houses.

08:45.495 --> 08:46.762
How are you
already here?

08:46.763 --> 08:48.730
You told the bartender,
the cab driver,

08:48.731 --> 08:50.365
the guy behind the hotel...

08:50.366 --> 08:51.867
We're all going on
a road trip. Who cares?

08:51.868 --> 08:53.435
Yeah. Road trip.

08:53.436 --> 08:56.338
And then, dude, and then
you got a fucking pumpkin

08:56.339 --> 08:57.572
and tried to stick
your dick in it.

08:57.573 --> 08:59.174
Yeah. You did
a little <i>American Pie,</i>

08:59.175 --> 09:00.942
Halloween's style.

09:00.943 --> 09:03.645
Zack, I want to be
there to help you out
on this situation but you did.

09:03.646 --> 09:06.581
- I'm sorry, I have rolling...
- Zack's version...

09:06.582 --> 09:08.450
But I doubt that I did that.

09:08.451 --> 09:09.718
Yo pumpkin pie.

09:09.719 --> 09:11.153
How're you feeling today?

09:11.154 --> 09:14.122
Like angels and sunbeams
and unicorns.

09:14.123 --> 09:15.624
- You look it.

09:15.625 --> 09:17.192
Just check it out.
I got part of the fridge

09:17.193 --> 09:18.927
that's just gonna be
Jeff's healthy stuff.

09:18.928 --> 09:19.995
All right,
so you guys know.

09:19.996 --> 09:22.097
You're an idiot.

09:22.098 --> 09:24.266
I will eat of your healthy
stuff for the whole trip
in one night after drinking.

09:24.267 --> 09:26.067
Why do you need
seven cameras?

09:26.068 --> 09:27.969
Why? 'Cause I
wanna document it all.

09:27.970 --> 09:31.206
You ready to go?
All right, let's go to it.
All right team on three. Boom!

09:31.207 --> 09:33.008
- Jeff, Jeff.
- What?

09:33.009 --> 09:35.444
You're never
ever gonna get laid
if you do things like that.

09:38.014 --> 09:39.281
- You excited?

09:39.282 --> 09:41.082
I'm excited.
These are always...

09:41.083 --> 09:43.385
I never know what
I'm getting myself into

09:43.386 --> 09:44.286
when we start off,

09:45.621 --> 09:47.622
but I always have
a good time by the end of it.

09:47.623 --> 09:49.491
So I'm definitely excited.

09:49.492 --> 09:51.092
Zack said you
were a little nervous.

09:51.093 --> 09:53.795
I know I tend to be jumpy

09:53.796 --> 09:56.665
as a person, so...

09:56.666 --> 09:58.700
Couple that with
the fact that I haven't

09:58.701 --> 10:02.037
been to a haunted house
in probably...

10:02.038 --> 10:05.073
I don't even
know how many years,
since I was eight or nine.

10:05.074 --> 10:07.476
I kinda don't really
know how I'm gonna react

10:07.477 --> 10:08.944
or what it's
gonna be like or...

10:08.945 --> 10:10.912
I think haunts
have come a long way.

10:12.048 --> 10:13.882
...since you were
eight or nine years old.

10:13.883 --> 10:15.851
See, as long as you
give me that in the houses,
we're good.

10:17.653 --> 10:19.654
Why don't you
tell us more about

10:21.491 --> 10:24.092
your little kid experience
going through a haunted house.

10:24.093 --> 10:24.559
Um... Well,
I assaulted a scare actor,

10:27.964 --> 10:29.965
when I was a child.

10:29.966 --> 10:32.501
Guy jumps down from a tree

10:32.502 --> 10:34.569
and I'm so petrified,
I don't...

10:34.570 --> 10:37.105
My bodily reaction is just
to punch him in the gut.

10:37.106 --> 10:39.741
When the lights
are going like this
and you're so disoriented,

10:39.742 --> 10:41.776
the guy actually it
seemed like he jumped

10:41.777 --> 10:44.646
straight back up into the tree
almost like he had like a...

10:44.647 --> 10:47.182
Seven foot vertical.

10:47.183 --> 10:49.684
Probably 'cause I was
like 3'7" at the time.

10:49.685 --> 10:53.455
I'm assuming
they've come a long way
since we were kids.

10:53.456 --> 10:54.723
Well, I mean,
I should hope so.

10:54.724 --> 10:56.892
'Cause I like the only
haunts I've ever been to

10:56.893 --> 10:59.194
are the ones at theme parks
or something like that,

10:59.195 --> 11:01.363
where the scariest thing is
somebody running up to you

11:01.364 --> 11:04.199
while you're waiting in line
for a hotdog or something.

11:04.200 --> 11:06.101
I promise you they're
not gonna be like that.

11:06.102 --> 11:08.103
All right.

11:08.104 --> 11:10.005
We're gonna be
out in the country,
there's gonna be no rules,

11:10.006 --> 11:12.607
o regulations.
- Mmm-hmm.

11:12.608 --> 11:14.476
I don't know how this
sounds like a good thing.

11:14.477 --> 11:17.012
This is always
what you wish.

11:17.013 --> 11:18.547
There's gonna be no rules,
no regulations.

11:18.548 --> 11:20.015
You don't even know
where we're going.

11:20.016 --> 11:22.817
I'm feeling kinda bad
for all these bugs
on the windshield.

11:22.818 --> 11:24.319
You're a pacifist for bugs?

11:24.320 --> 11:25.954
I felt bad 'cause there were

11:25.955 --> 11:27.489
a few butterflies that
hit the windshield too.

11:27.490 --> 11:29.057
I'd like to
know where we're...

11:29.058 --> 11:30.792
Settle down.
I've got something
planned for everyone.

11:30.793 --> 11:32.294
You have it all planned out.

11:32.295 --> 11:33.762
You know exactly
where we're going?

11:33.763 --> 11:35.864
I know exactly
where we're going.

11:35.865 --> 11:36.064
Let's get directions.
No way he's guiding
this fucking ship.

11:38.134 --> 11:39.467
It's not organic.

11:40.970 --> 11:43.171
I'm still
making pancakes so...

11:43.172 --> 11:43.605
This thing is sweet,
I don't know why.

11:44.473 --> 11:46.808
Paddle.

11:48.411 --> 11:50.779
Hey, man, do you know how
to get to the haunt house?

11:50.780 --> 11:52.113
Are you all sure
you wanna go there?

11:52.114 --> 11:53.515
Mikey,
stop screwing around.

11:53.516 --> 11:55.383
- We can't find the exit.
- We're just lost.

11:55.384 --> 11:57.953
Yeah? All right.
You go down the road
right here about five miles.

11:57.954 --> 12:00.322
- It'll be in the forest
on the left hand side.
Mike, let's go.

12:00.323 --> 12:01.823
- I want this.
- You're not buying that.

12:01.824 --> 12:02.958
- Thank you so much.
- Let's go.

12:02.959 --> 12:04.225
Hey, guys, we got...

12:05.628 --> 12:07.228
- You know where it is?
- Yeah.

12:07.229 --> 12:08.363
It's five miles
up the road.

12:08.364 --> 12:10.665
Getting
antsy over there, Jeff?

12:10.666 --> 12:13.401
No, I'm just, you know,
jumping to my own beat.
You know?

12:13.402 --> 12:15.437
Just jump...
Jumpin' to my beat.

12:15.438 --> 12:17.439
- You know,
I hope everyone...
- Jumping to his own beat.

12:17.440 --> 12:18.974
I might just
rap for you later.

12:18.975 --> 12:20.342
One celebratory
shot on the road.

12:22.812 --> 12:24.012
That's what last night was.

12:24.013 --> 12:25.714
Yeah, but now we're like

12:25.715 --> 12:27.315
"on the road", on the road.

12:27.316 --> 12:28.817
I'll drink if Jeff does.

12:28.818 --> 12:30.585
Air shots?

12:32.254 --> 12:34.389
Dude you look like
you're jerking off
an elephant.

12:38.494 --> 12:40.161
Jeff,
I heard that you have a poem.

12:40.162 --> 12:40.929
The... Oh, the poem.

12:42.632 --> 12:43.698
I don't know
if he can read it.

12:43.699 --> 12:44.799
I can't read it while I'm...

12:44.800 --> 12:46.401
I can read the poem.

12:46.402 --> 12:47.502
I wanna read it.
I haven't read it.

12:47.503 --> 12:48.069
"I am poem."

12:49.171 --> 12:50.238
I gotta listen to this.

12:50.239 --> 12:53.141
"I am Job."

12:54.310 --> 12:57.379
You hear that,
the first line.

12:57.380 --> 13:00.849
"I'm a swell guy
who eats strawberries.

13:00.850 --> 13:01.316
"I wonder if demons
even inhabited the earth.

13:04.854 --> 13:05.120
"I hear angels crying in my

13:08.324 --> 13:09.424
"brain?"

13:09.425 --> 13:10.792
"In my barn."

13:10.793 --> 13:12.027
- "Barn."
In my what?

13:12.028 --> 13:13.061
"I touched the roughness...

13:14.497 --> 13:16.698
"The roughness
of Bigfoot's arm."

13:20.469 --> 13:22.604
No transition,
nothing.

13:22.605 --> 13:23.204
Mikey, it's called art.

13:26.175 --> 13:27.942
I'm so excited.

13:29.345 --> 13:30.979
This is the first night.

13:35.384 --> 13:38.820
These haunt owners
have forums, chat rooms.

13:38.821 --> 13:40.255
They put up these pictures.

13:40.256 --> 13:42.257
Dude, there's some crazy shit
that goes on there.

13:42.258 --> 13:43.291
You're in,
you could park up there.

13:44.493 --> 13:45.994
Are you the sheriff
of the town?

13:45.995 --> 13:47.095
- Am I?
- Yeah.

13:47.096 --> 13:48.229
No, I'm just security.

13:48.230 --> 13:49.330
Oh, okay, okay.

13:49.331 --> 13:50.532
I wish I was sheriff.

13:50.533 --> 13:52.067
Awesome.

13:52.068 --> 13:53.568
Hello!

13:54.637 --> 13:55.403
- Cool.
- Haunt house.

13:57.039 --> 13:58.106
Let's do it.

13:58.107 --> 13:59.174
Let's get scared.

14:00.476 --> 14:01.676
Let's get scared.

14:25.735 --> 14:27.535
You didn't do that.

14:39.982 --> 14:42.417
I will finally make you
get in a coffin, look.

14:47.990 --> 14:50.191
Let me the fuck out of here!

14:58.267 --> 14:59.367
You're such a dick.

14:59.368 --> 15:00.268
You know I'm claustrophobic.

15:01.837 --> 15:03.238
We can go in now?

15:04.306 --> 15:06.741
You coming?

15:09.111 --> 15:11.746
Shit! Didn't even
get in the door yet.

15:27.463 --> 15:28.530
Got you.

15:32.268 --> 15:33.635
Mikey?
I can't see shit.

16:23.919 --> 16:25.353
- Bobby?

16:26.722 --> 16:28.022
What the fuck?

16:38.534 --> 16:39.300
Where the hell are we?

16:40.836 --> 16:42.837
Even the music is creepy.

16:46.508 --> 16:48.109
So weird.

16:53.449 --> 16:54.749
What the fuck?

16:59.021 --> 16:59.988
Come play with me.

17:01.657 --> 17:02.724
Follow her.

17:05.294 --> 17:07.462
Get the fuck down!
Fuck!

17:09.031 --> 17:10.098
You wanna be
a pretty doll like me?

17:15.503 --> 17:17.538
Oh, shit!
What was that?

17:17.539 --> 17:19.807
Bobby, don't go over there.

17:19.808 --> 17:22.242
- Ashes!
- What is going on?

17:22.243 --> 17:24.178
Ashes!

17:24.179 --> 17:26.748
We all fall down!

17:33.355 --> 17:34.889
Get the fuck out of here!

17:34.890 --> 17:37.692
Come back here.
I'm not done with you yet.

17:37.693 --> 17:38.927
They just love to run you
out of those places
with chainsaws.

17:41.563 --> 17:42.397
Bob, did you like it?

17:44.099 --> 17:46.134
I don't give
a shit about this place.
I wanna talk to these people.

17:46.135 --> 17:47.235
What's goin' on?
How are you?

17:47.236 --> 17:48.336
Pretty good.

17:48.337 --> 17:50.438
Uh, do you care if we
ask you some questions?

17:50.439 --> 17:50.905
Sure.

17:52.174 --> 17:54.042
So my friend here
thinks that, uh,

17:54.043 --> 17:56.744
shady shit goes on
in these places.
What do you think?

17:56.745 --> 17:59.414
I can probably say
I agree with that.

17:59.415 --> 18:01.516
I would think it just
be fun to work here.

18:01.517 --> 18:03.251
It is fun. It's interesting.

18:03.252 --> 18:05.053
It's definitely different.

18:06.789 --> 18:08.323
How so?

18:12.728 --> 18:14.963
Bob, Bob, Bob,
let's go on the roof.

18:14.964 --> 18:16.564
There's a ladder
right over there.

18:16.565 --> 18:17.665
You will never
be able to get
on the roof.

18:17.666 --> 18:19.233
We can film over like that.

18:19.234 --> 18:20.401
There's a ladder
at the back.

18:21.804 --> 18:23.338
Okay.

18:24.740 --> 18:26.240
Mikey,
when you get up there,

18:26.241 --> 18:26.507
- do the fucking
<i>Almost Famous</i> thing.
- What is that?

18:28.744 --> 18:30.244
Stop being
so fucking paranoid.

18:32.247 --> 18:32.447
--Oh, shit!

18:33.682 --> 18:36.484
There's a shit ton
of people down there, man.

18:43.459 --> 18:46.361
Happy Halloween, guys! Yay!

18:46.362 --> 18:47.462
Whoo! Whoo!

18:48.397 --> 18:51.199
They're not
fucking happy, Mike.

18:52.935 --> 18:54.669
Go.
Get out of here. Go, go.

18:59.208 --> 19:00.541
- Mikey?
- What?

19:00.542 --> 19:02.043
Be quiet...

19:02.044 --> 19:03.277
Mikey, let's go. Now!

19:04.646 --> 19:06.247
Take your hoodie off, son.

19:06.248 --> 19:07.815
Take your hoodie off.

19:07.816 --> 19:09.517
- Where ya goin', boy?

19:13.455 --> 19:15.456
Well it's
the first night and you've

19:15.457 --> 19:17.392
already pissed off
all the haunt workers.

19:17.393 --> 19:18.626
So good one, guys.

19:18.627 --> 19:20.028
What's the scariest part?

19:20.029 --> 19:23.164
I mean creepy guy one,
creepy girl two...

19:23.165 --> 19:25.566
I like the bush,
like the...

19:25.567 --> 19:27.068
There was this weird part,

19:27.069 --> 19:28.503
where we had to wait
because people would be...

19:28.504 --> 19:29.771
Mike,
are you sleeping already?

19:29.772 --> 19:31.205
Before you went
through the back...

19:31.206 --> 19:32.540
The guy was in camo,
and he jumped
out of the rose bush...

19:32.541 --> 19:35.710
I need you to
show me the side...

19:35.711 --> 19:37.445
Mike,
that's that clown.

19:37.446 --> 19:39.213
Bobby, what are you
talking about?

19:41.717 --> 19:43.384
Dude tried
to break my camera.

19:43.385 --> 19:44.485
He seems really pissed.

19:49.992 --> 19:52.326
Can we just go?
This guy is weirding me out.

19:52.327 --> 19:53.995
Am I good on that side?
Can I?

19:53.996 --> 19:55.630
- Get the fuck
outta here.

20:37.139 --> 20:38.739
Did you all here that?

20:56.391 --> 20:57.825
Shit!

20:57.826 --> 20:59.393
What the fuck?

21:04.933 --> 21:06.167
Hello?

21:24.786 --> 21:26.754
- Shit!

21:26.755 --> 21:27.622
Jesus!

21:30.659 --> 21:31.492
- Jesus!

21:35.330 --> 21:36.264
You fucking kidding me?

21:37.399 --> 21:38.933
You asshole.

21:38.934 --> 21:40.535
- You literally
shit in your pants.
Come on, man.

21:40.536 --> 21:43.137
Oh, my God! I wish the camera
could have seen you face.

21:43.138 --> 21:43.371
- I'm too overweight for this.
- I'm gonna have a heart attack.

21:45.440 --> 21:47.475
How far will you go
to scare people?

21:49.545 --> 21:50.945
Uh...

21:52.781 --> 21:54.415
Perhaps to the point of...

21:54.416 --> 21:56.117
They won't let us
touch 'em or bash 'em over

21:56.118 --> 21:57.752
the head and drag
'em off anywhere,

21:57.753 --> 21:59.754
so I have to kinda
stop at that point.

21:59.755 --> 22:00.288
I heard of, uh,

22:02.291 --> 22:03.224
a  in New Orleans
doing a lot of weird
crazy stuff but,

22:07.162 --> 22:09.430
I have never been to
one that really does that.

22:09.431 --> 22:13.201
Thank goodness!
That's invading my
territorial bubble.

22:13.202 --> 22:15.236
I tend to freak out if
you try to tie me up.

22:15.237 --> 22:18.506
I grew up with three sisters.
They always tied me up
and did things to me

22:18.507 --> 22:20.741
and I don't...
Yeah, I don't... Yeah.

22:20.742 --> 22:22.009
No, I wouldn't go for that.

22:28.283 --> 22:29.917
No, not completely naked...

22:29.918 --> 22:30.851
I have, like, you know,

22:32.421 --> 22:33.921
a little bathing suit on
and whatever,

22:33.922 --> 22:36.357
and the whole rest
of my body was blue.

22:36.358 --> 22:36.691
I had weird ears and a tail
and everything like that.

22:39.461 --> 22:40.294
Most Zack's ever done is

22:42.631 --> 22:43.164
done a white
sheet over his head
and two black holes.

22:46.935 --> 22:48.936
Wasn't he like
a muscle man one year?

22:48.937 --> 22:50.004
I highly doubt it.

22:50.005 --> 22:50.705
I was the Shake Weight.

22:52.274 --> 22:55.042
That's what he was,
he was a Shake Weight.

22:55.043 --> 22:56.544
The Shake Weight guy.

22:56.545 --> 22:57.745
Don't ever do that again.

22:57.746 --> 22:59.513
So gross.

23:00.916 --> 23:02.783
Okay.

23:02.784 --> 23:05.686
Okay, I'm just
reading this tweet, okay.

23:05.687 --> 23:08.656
"They say penis size
is related to shoe size,

23:08.657 --> 23:09.390
"which makes
the fear of being raped
by a clown that much scarier."

23:14.196 --> 23:15.730
Give me some of those.

23:17.065 --> 23:18.366
I will trade you...

23:20.002 --> 23:22.470
...my chocolate

23:22.471 --> 23:22.903
- for one of these.
Bro,
look at your eyes.

23:24.006 --> 23:26.607
I can't help it.
I gotta take a piss.

23:28.310 --> 23:31.045
But there's a fucking
lineup for the bathroom.

23:31.046 --> 23:31.178
Now I'm residual high.

23:33.315 --> 23:34.649
From your cigarettes.

23:36.518 --> 23:39.253
- I like that trade.

23:42.858 --> 23:46.327
Right. When do you
think you're gonna
tell us where we're going?

23:51.133 --> 23:52.300
It's gonna be a shit show

23:52.301 --> 23:53.367
when we go on
this haunt tonight.

23:53.368 --> 23:54.568
It's all his fault.

23:54.569 --> 23:56.304
I didn't know you
couldn't handle smoking weed.

24:02.210 --> 24:03.577
Oh, my God!

24:03.578 --> 24:04.278
Oh, my God!

24:06.548 --> 24:08.816
Oh, my God!
He is still crying.

24:08.817 --> 24:10.451
You really
think it's a good idea

24:10.452 --> 24:11.986
for you walk through
any of these haunts?

24:11.987 --> 24:13.154
I've got a few hours.

24:13.155 --> 24:14.922
Yeah, fucked up?

24:14.923 --> 24:16.891
You're gonna be a train wreck.

24:16.892 --> 24:18.259
It's his fault.

24:18.260 --> 24:19.527
I don't care
whose fault it is,

24:19.528 --> 24:20.895
we've got to be
there in two hours.

24:20.896 --> 24:23.197
This place is very creepy.

24:23.198 --> 24:24.365
I'm scared, you're scared,
we're all scared.

24:26.201 --> 24:27.835
And then we can get...

24:29.571 --> 24:32.640
You sound like,
"You scream, I scream,
we all scream for ice cream."

24:32.641 --> 24:33.874
You have any?

24:35.644 --> 24:37.712
Brandy,
what are you most afraid of?

24:39.614 --> 24:41.615
- I have a fear of snakes.
- Me too.

24:41.616 --> 24:44.018
I guarantee you
snakes are...

24:44.019 --> 24:46.253
I hate 'em.
They don't move right.

24:46.254 --> 24:49.223
They're just unnatural.
I'm not a fan at all.

24:49.224 --> 24:51.292
I met a chick once and when
we came back to her place,

24:51.293 --> 24:53.427
and she had a fucking python,
like, as a pet.

24:53.428 --> 24:54.729
And she just pulled it out.

24:54.730 --> 24:56.497
She'd come home drunk
and pulled it...
I'm like, "Ahh!

24:56.498 --> 24:57.932
"This is never gonna work."

24:57.933 --> 24:59.767
I'm gonna put you
in a coffin and then

24:59.768 --> 25:01.535
put snakes in the coffin,
would you do it?

25:01.536 --> 25:03.504
No, absolutely not.
I will not...

25:03.505 --> 25:05.873
How much would
we have to pay you?

25:05.874 --> 25:08.476
For $1,000 would you
get in the coffin?

25:08.477 --> 25:10.277
For $5,000 I would.

25:10.278 --> 25:12.413
Coffin,
cut a hole at the bottom
and send snakes through it.

25:12.414 --> 25:15.683
Are they poisonous?
Can you guarantee
they're not poisonous?

25:15.684 --> 25:15.850
Yes, they're poisonous.

25:17.652 --> 25:19.520
These are
big boy seats.

25:20.889 --> 25:22.523
Bobby what was that thing

25:23.992 --> 25:24.525
you were just saying about me
just a couple of minutes ago?

25:26.695 --> 25:27.862
I don't recall.

25:29.131 --> 25:30.865
Well, I'll just lead you in
and remind you...

25:30.866 --> 25:33.567
- We're lucky to have you
- ...and refresh your memory.

25:33.568 --> 25:35.102
We're lucky to have you.

25:35.103 --> 25:37.638
Yeah,
say that one more time.
Hold on.

25:37.639 --> 25:39.140
- Brandy, we're...
- Hold on.

25:39.141 --> 25:41.008
And... Go!

25:41.009 --> 25:42.743
Brandy, we're lucky
to have you here.

25:42.744 --> 25:44.412
Yeah, that's right.

25:44.413 --> 25:46.180
How do you feel
about that, Mike?

25:46.181 --> 25:46.781
About what?

25:48.183 --> 25:50.851
I wouldn't call you
a sister I never had.

25:50.852 --> 25:52.853
Just in case we
ever get naked.

25:52.854 --> 25:54.221
Already had her.

25:54.222 --> 25:55.856
- Already had her.
- Never gonna happen.

25:55.857 --> 25:58.926
We made out on a roof top,
kind of one time
when we were 16.

25:58.927 --> 26:00.060
There was
actually no making out.

26:00.061 --> 26:01.262
We didn't make out,

26:01.263 --> 26:03.197
it was just like heavy
petting. It was weird.

26:03.198 --> 26:04.965
Zack, is there
like a trailer for this haunt?

26:07.436 --> 26:09.503
Like, did they
make a commercial?

26:09.504 --> 26:09.937
Yeah I was
trying to show Brandy
but she just freaked out.

26:11.907 --> 26:14.074
Why don't any
of these haunts
make commercials?

26:16.178 --> 26:18.212
I don't see commercials do ya?

26:20.582 --> 26:21.782
Asshole!

26:21.783 --> 26:23.617
Are you
fucking kidding me?

26:23.618 --> 26:23.918
We're gonna be in the...
Driving the scares in
the zombie paint ball.

26:27.389 --> 26:28.556
Jeff, did you hear that?

26:28.557 --> 26:29.723
It's gonna be awesome.

26:29.724 --> 26:31.091
Can't wait.

26:31.092 --> 26:33.461
Now, do the zombies have guns?

26:33.462 --> 26:35.296
Are we out in
the forest paint balling?

26:35.297 --> 26:36.597
I don't know...

26:36.598 --> 26:38.332
Have you ever seen
a zombie shoot a gun?

26:38.333 --> 26:39.033
No, I've never seen...

26:40.135 --> 26:41.969
Has it ever happened
in cinema history?

26:41.970 --> 26:42.903
No, but... I don't know.

26:44.739 --> 26:46.040
Are they gonna
shoot back at us though?

26:47.209 --> 26:48.676
All head shots,
right, Jeff?

26:48.677 --> 26:49.877
Zombie 101.

26:49.878 --> 26:51.212
Hey, we have time.

26:52.447 --> 26:54.014
You guys wanna pull over
and have drinks first?

27:00.122 --> 27:01.489
All alone now.

27:04.826 --> 27:06.093
Nature.

27:06.094 --> 27:08.062
Somebody was
here before us.

27:09.598 --> 27:11.499
Yeah.

27:11.500 --> 27:14.602
Yeah, they said it was
okay to camp over here.

27:14.603 --> 27:16.003
I mean,
it just went out.

27:16.004 --> 27:17.371
- Got any wood?
- Not a big camper...

27:17.372 --> 27:18.672
Were you a Brownie?

27:18.673 --> 27:20.841
- Yep.
- I ate a brownie once.

27:20.842 --> 27:23.110
Really?

27:23.111 --> 27:24.645
How do you know...
That's a beautiful fire.

27:24.646 --> 27:25.946
Have you ever
camped in your life?

27:25.947 --> 27:28.315
Nope,
not when I stay at Motel 6.

27:31.987 --> 27:33.654
Hey, more beer.

27:33.655 --> 27:35.723
That's not
why I'm on this trip.

27:35.724 --> 27:36.891
We don't have marshmallows?

27:36.892 --> 27:38.425
No.

27:38.426 --> 27:39.960
No, it's for you.

27:39.961 --> 27:41.061
Drink it, drink it.
Drink it, Bran.

27:43.565 --> 27:44.765
Don't waste it.

27:44.766 --> 27:45.499
Yuck!

27:46.668 --> 27:49.570
It was just the foam,
that's so gross.

27:49.571 --> 27:51.405
So this is a rap
I wrote this morning.

27:51.406 --> 27:53.474
"Livin' in a barn
is the life for me.

27:53.475 --> 27:55.342
"Green hill farm
is the place to be.

27:55.343 --> 27:57.444
"If you pee on a fence
and you hate your wiener,

27:57.445 --> 27:59.813
"don't be looking at my turkey
'cause he ain't for dinner.

27:59.814 --> 28:01.348
"4:00 a.m.
and the cows get up.

28:01.349 --> 28:03.417
"No desert till you
crush that sauerkraut.

28:03.418 --> 28:04.518
"Got a barn full of hay,

28:04.519 --> 28:05.653
"A fire with some s'mores,

28:05.654 --> 28:07.454
"Mom yelling
'Chickens, chores!'

28:07.455 --> 28:09.390
"Ain't no arcade till
that shit gets shoveled.

28:09.391 --> 28:11.592
"What you lookin' at, fool?
This is life in a bubble."

28:14.729 --> 28:16.363
That's from
Ohio right there.
- Yeah.

28:16.364 --> 28:17.765
- We know.
- Straight up.

28:17.766 --> 28:18.832
Shampoo conditioner.

28:18.833 --> 28:19.733
Beard repair.

28:20.936 --> 28:21.435
Uh...

28:22.604 --> 28:24.972
What's that goes underneath
my skin? Beard oil.

28:24.973 --> 28:26.473
What's beard repair?

28:26.474 --> 28:28.342
Repairs you do like
once every three days.

28:28.343 --> 28:30.110
- Those are all flammable.
- You know that, right?

28:30.111 --> 28:31.612
- Hello.
- Huh? Fuck!

28:31.613 --> 28:32.980
- You all enjoying my fire?
- Jesus.

28:32.981 --> 28:34.248
Holy shit, man.

28:39.788 --> 28:42.856
So, what the hell you
doin' out in the woods?

28:42.857 --> 28:44.758
I live out there.

28:44.759 --> 28:46.594
- Which haunt do you work at?
- The one down the road?

28:46.595 --> 28:48.062
Yeah.

28:48.063 --> 28:48.996
Yeah, we're
goin' there next, I think.

28:48.997 --> 28:50.531
Yeah.

28:50.532 --> 28:52.099
We see a bunch of kids
at a lot of these haunts,

28:52.100 --> 28:54.068
'cause no one's calling
Social Services on 'em.

28:54.069 --> 28:56.437
They're like eight,
nine years old.

28:56.438 --> 28:59.340
You know, it's like here
in backwoods and shit,

28:59.341 --> 29:00.407
there's no rules,
there's none of that stuff.

29:01.776 --> 29:03.944
What you mean "backwoods"?

29:23.865 --> 29:27.468
If that dude
is still at our campfire
when we go back, I'm out.

29:27.469 --> 29:29.903
I hope they shoot you
with a paint ball.

29:29.904 --> 29:33.240
Hey, this place is
putting my Presidential
stimulus plan in action.

29:33.241 --> 29:34.108
Do you want the camera?
Can you come over here now?

29:35.977 --> 29:37.511
Hey, do you...

29:38.880 --> 29:40.414
Can we film in here?

29:40.415 --> 29:41.115
All right, awesome.

29:42.617 --> 29:43.017
I prefer to call it
a zombie stimulus plan.

29:46.888 --> 29:49.823
--Brandy thinks it's a laser.

29:49.824 --> 29:51.892
- I'm really excited.
- That's ridiculous.

29:51.893 --> 29:54.328
How long have
you guys been doin'
the zombie paintball?

29:54.329 --> 29:55.729
This is our first year.

29:55.730 --> 29:57.298
- First year?
- Groundbreaking!

29:57.299 --> 29:59.333
Wow!

29:59.334 --> 30:00.801
Well, I'm gonna
tell everybody I know,
just so you know.

30:00.802 --> 30:02.936
Seven more people
are going to find out.

30:02.937 --> 30:04.471
He has
seven Facebook friends.

30:09.711 --> 30:11.345
I don't think
I hit anything.
Get closer.

30:11.346 --> 30:13.480
So, how can you do that?
How can you do that?

30:17.986 --> 30:19.787
Put these on.

30:19.788 --> 30:22.323
All right, guys,
getting into dead
territory over here.

30:24.793 --> 30:26.894
Oh, fuck,
look at that face.

30:26.895 --> 30:28.629
Man,
I'm gonna crush this guy.
There he is.

30:31.199 --> 30:31.565
- Get that one.

30:40.141 --> 30:42.209
Get it, get it, get it.

30:43.912 --> 30:45.979
Oh, shit!

30:45.980 --> 30:47.214
Yeah, you bitches!
Fucking die!

30:48.817 --> 30:49.917
Hey, Mikey,
did that hit you?

30:49.918 --> 30:52.086
Yeah. Right in the face, dude.

30:55.690 --> 30:56.957
Power of Christ
compels you!

30:56.958 --> 30:58.325
That was awesome.

31:00.628 --> 31:04.531
That was the most fun
I've had in forever,
that was so cool.

31:04.532 --> 31:06.367
Zack, I will do
whatever you wanna do.

31:06.368 --> 31:07.701
Thank you.

31:07.702 --> 31:10.304
Hey! I want that written
down and documented.

31:10.305 --> 31:12.506
Jeff said,
"I will do whatever
you want on this trip."

31:12.507 --> 31:14.808
Whatever, this is
like the most fun ever.

31:14.809 --> 31:16.643
What did you think, mate?

31:16.644 --> 31:17.244
Banging around.

31:18.446 --> 31:19.980
- I'll fix it.
- RV is breaking down.

31:19.981 --> 31:22.449
I'm going to be banging
around back there soon

31:22.450 --> 31:23.550
with a zombie.

31:23.551 --> 31:25.052
Bang around and go
to fucking bed.

31:25.053 --> 31:26.954
That joke is
never going to die.

31:26.955 --> 31:28.355
I think let's pull over.

31:28.356 --> 31:29.590
Keep going.

31:29.591 --> 31:30.924
What the fuck is that?

31:30.925 --> 31:31.825
Hey, guys.

31:33.128 --> 31:35.129
Is that the girl
from the haunt?

31:35.130 --> 31:36.630
We're 100 miles from there,
there's no way that's her.

31:36.631 --> 31:37.998
Stop.
Pull over in front of her.

31:37.999 --> 31:39.700
- Oh, my God.
- Why?

31:39.701 --> 31:40.834
What,
are you going to talk
to her or something?

31:40.835 --> 31:42.770
Stop. Pull over.
Just pull up.

31:42.771 --> 31:44.338
- I'll go talk to her.
Trying to
be the hero?

31:44.339 --> 31:45.672
Well,
I'm not trying to be a...

31:45.673 --> 31:46.507
Real, genuine, Texan.

31:49.778 --> 31:50.844
Why does your brother do this?

31:50.845 --> 31:52.579
Also 3:00 in the morning.

31:58.353 --> 31:59.753
Oh!
There goes your brother.

31:59.754 --> 32:01.522
She didn't
really say anything.

32:09.731 --> 32:10.964
Mikey, what's going on?

32:10.965 --> 32:11.698
I don't know.

32:13.001 --> 32:14.668
She just kind of
followed me in here.

32:17.906 --> 32:19.373
Something
happened to your car?

32:24.279 --> 32:24.778
Can you call somebody
or something?

32:26.681 --> 32:28.649
Is there
anywhere we can take you?

32:59.814 --> 33:00.547
What the fuck was that?

33:02.116 --> 33:04.518
Getting the fuck out of here.

33:06.054 --> 33:07.321
She was just
fucking with us. Let's go.

33:12.727 --> 33:14.328
It was okay,
but it was too scary for me.

33:14.329 --> 33:15.395
- It was good.
- Yeah?

33:15.396 --> 33:16.597
It was a good
little scare.

33:16.598 --> 33:18.165
The scariest thing is
when the walls open up

33:18.166 --> 33:19.766
and they come
out from the walls.

33:19.767 --> 33:21.835
You don't even see 'em
'cause they look
like the walls.

33:21.836 --> 33:23.504
There's all blood
gushing everywhere.

33:23.505 --> 33:26.006
I was like,
"Oh, my gosh".

33:26.007 --> 33:27.941
It was like, "Get me
out of this damn place".

33:27.942 --> 33:29.843
Because I was scared
he had a chainsaw!

33:29.844 --> 33:31.411
That's what
I'm looking for.

33:31.412 --> 33:32.579
This lady, uh-uh.

33:32.580 --> 33:32.746
She wants the,
"Ooh, all scary.
Oh, my God." No.

33:36.918 --> 33:39.286
We want the real stuff,
the <i>Faces of Death</i> stuff.

33:39.287 --> 33:42.089
Your community service was
working at a haunted house?

33:42.090 --> 33:43.891
For real, for real.

33:43.892 --> 33:46.527
Okay, see, now that,
had I known that first,

33:46.528 --> 33:48.729
- that'd make it
scarier going in.
- Yeah.

33:51.866 --> 33:53.133
Let's do it.

33:53.134 --> 33:54.334
Is everybody else up?

33:54.335 --> 33:56.136
Uh, I don't know.

33:56.137 --> 33:57.638
Mikey's definitely not.

33:57.639 --> 33:59.473
I think I nudged him,
like, five times.

33:59.474 --> 34:01.708
Does it have to be
like this every morning?

34:01.709 --> 34:04.011
I need eight minutes
to totally get ready.

34:04.012 --> 34:05.412
I'll be fine.
You get ready.

34:05.413 --> 34:07.781
The last night
was really weird.

34:07.782 --> 34:10.150
- Yeah, you made it weird.
- You brought her in here.

34:10.150 --> 34:13.887
Oh, man, I didn't think
that was going to happen,
it was just...

34:13.888 --> 34:17.491
It's kind of weird.
It's almost like
they're fictional characters.

34:17.492 --> 34:19.326
- You know what I mean?
- Yep.

34:19.327 --> 34:20.627
So funny.

34:20.628 --> 34:22.228
I mean,
I guess not really funny.

34:28.268 --> 34:30.137
Bob, what exactly are
you looking for on this?

34:30.138 --> 34:33.005
I mean these...
You keep saying back country.

34:33.007 --> 34:34.507
I mean, that's...

34:34.509 --> 34:35.775
Where these hillbillies...

34:35.777 --> 34:37.744
Some of them are
a little messed up.

34:37.745 --> 34:39.545
These places though,
it's like,

34:39.547 --> 34:42.282
we have this password
we have to find for this.

34:42.283 --> 34:44.451
They say "blue skull,
blue skeleton."

34:44.452 --> 34:47.588
But there's something to blue
because people keep using it.

34:47.589 --> 34:50.023
And it was in Dallas,
then it was in Houston.

34:50.024 --> 34:51.224
And so it moves around.

34:51.225 --> 34:52.960
So it's not as
much about backwoods

34:52.960 --> 34:55.762
as we're going to have to
go to the backwoods
to find the password.

34:55.763 --> 34:57.497
But the place,
it seems like...

34:57.498 --> 34:58.765
"Is this the haunt hole?"

34:58.766 --> 35:00.534
What is an extreme haunt?

35:00.535 --> 35:03.236
Instead of them
chasing you with a chainsaw
with no chain on it,

35:03.237 --> 35:06.173
they're going to chase you
with the chain on it
and like...

35:06.174 --> 35:08.175
I don't understand how far...

35:08.176 --> 35:11.378
Like, how far you really
can go on without
hurting somebody.

35:18.720 --> 35:20.253
- But that's where...
- Oh, shit.

35:20.254 --> 35:21.822
You need to get out,
and we need to check with...

35:21.823 --> 35:23.023
Guys,
where in the hell
is this place?

35:24.292 --> 35:26.994
I want to say it's
further away than you think,

35:30.498 --> 35:33.367
but, Todd says, "Are we lost?"

35:39.073 --> 35:41.308
Look at this place.

35:41.309 --> 35:43.043
Can I even fit,
Zack, is this...

35:43.044 --> 35:44.711
Can you
even get in here?

35:44.712 --> 35:46.780
Going to
have to make it work.

35:46.781 --> 35:49.116
Oh, my God.

35:49.117 --> 35:50.751
Can you try not to run over
any more children?

35:50.752 --> 35:52.152
All these people
are already outside.

35:54.122 --> 35:55.822
It's actually kind of cool
to get here early and see

35:55.823 --> 35:57.691
like, they're,
like, being real people.

35:57.692 --> 35:59.393
Oh!

36:08.102 --> 36:09.503
This place
is a shit hole, Bobby.

36:09.504 --> 36:11.004
In the middle
of bumfuck nowhere.

36:11.005 --> 36:12.673
His back was enough
for you, Bobby?

36:12.674 --> 36:14.408
These are your people,
farm boy.

36:14.409 --> 36:16.643
That's right, dude.
- It looks like high
school kids made this.

36:16.644 --> 36:18.578
- What up?
- What?

36:18.579 --> 36:19.880
- I couldn't even go.
Let's go.
We're going to...

36:19.881 --> 36:20.614
What so you mean...
Let's go.

36:20.615 --> 36:22.816
The line was ridiculous.

36:22.817 --> 36:24.184
Why are you waiting in line?
We're in the middle
of a fucking forest.

36:24.185 --> 36:24.718
Go piss in the bushes.

36:39.634 --> 36:41.301
Holy shit.

36:42.637 --> 36:43.403
Dude.

36:44.472 --> 36:45.272
Nice costume.

36:47.775 --> 36:48.842
Jesus!

36:53.014 --> 36:54.081
Okay.

36:56.617 --> 36:57.751
Holy shit.

36:57.752 --> 36:59.086
What the hell, man?

36:59.087 --> 37:00.954
Leave me alone.

37:00.955 --> 37:02.355
Don't!

37:02.356 --> 37:04.057
Why the fuck are
you following me?

37:04.058 --> 37:05.592
Oh, fuck.

37:05.593 --> 37:06.960
Get the fuck away.

37:08.963 --> 37:10.163
Oh, fuck!

37:13.267 --> 37:15.502
Please, what do you want?

37:16.871 --> 37:18.171
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

37:19.373 --> 37:20.574
What the fuck?

37:25.913 --> 37:26.947
Jesus. Not even a haunt yet.

37:28.149 --> 37:30.217
Zack?

37:31.285 --> 37:32.152
Yo.

37:38.025 --> 37:39.860
What are you doing, man?

37:46.934 --> 37:48.068
Hey, guys! How's it going?
What's your name, buddy?

37:50.738 --> 37:53.273
Hi, Mikey.
How are you doin'?

37:53.274 --> 37:56.042
What's the camera for?
Are you guys
doing <i>Crimestoppers</i>

37:56.043 --> 37:57.377
or <i>Cops</i> or something?

37:57.378 --> 37:58.945
We're doing
<i>To Catch a Predator.</i>

37:58.946 --> 38:00.547
<i>To Catch a Predator?</i>

38:00.548 --> 38:03.416
I gotta go.

38:03.417 --> 38:07.354
Watch out,
where're you going,
you piece of shit?

38:07.355 --> 38:08.054
Ooh.
Oh, I like big, fuzzy bears.

38:11.192 --> 38:12.425
Ooh.

38:12.426 --> 38:14.161
Oh!
Always touch the beard.

38:14.162 --> 38:15.562
Always touch the beard.

38:15.563 --> 38:16.830
I feel
so violated right now.

38:25.706 --> 38:27.507
Zack, watch the light.

38:29.177 --> 38:30.310
Trying, dude.
Go ahead of us.

38:39.854 --> 38:43.023
Break out! Break out!

38:43.024 --> 38:45.759
Come on!

38:47.562 --> 38:49.462
Zack?

38:49.463 --> 38:50.797
Where did you go?

38:52.066 --> 38:53.800
Wait, where are you?

39:00.575 --> 39:02.309
Which way?

39:17.091 --> 39:18.425
That's disgusting.

39:18.426 --> 39:19.559
Brandy, you all right?

39:24.799 --> 39:26.099
Please!

39:26.100 --> 39:28.468
No, no! Let me go, please.

39:32.440 --> 39:34.574
Let me out.
Let me out.

39:34.575 --> 39:35.909
Let me out!

39:38.145 --> 39:39.779
Please, let me go!

39:39.780 --> 39:41.781
Ed, shut the fuck up!

39:41.782 --> 39:42.616
This is so fucked up.

39:45.386 --> 39:46.720
You want
a piece of her, boys?

39:48.923 --> 39:51.758
Zack, I don't think
we're supposed to go in here.

39:51.759 --> 39:52.859
Zack! Don't go...

39:54.295 --> 39:55.395
Don't go.

39:56.497 --> 39:57.898
I'm just
here for your father.

39:57.899 --> 40:00.367
Get that thing out of here!

40:09.043 --> 40:10.243
Get out of here!

40:10.244 --> 40:11.611
Guys,
let's get out of here!

40:11.612 --> 40:13.346
Get the fuck out of here!

40:43.377 --> 40:45.412
He's still behind you!

40:45.413 --> 40:47.347
Walk, walk, walk.
He's still following us.

40:49.951 --> 40:51.084
Zack!

40:51.085 --> 40:53.653
Oh, my God!

40:59.393 --> 41:00.593
Oh, my God!

41:00.594 --> 41:01.661
Oh, God!

41:05.866 --> 41:07.167
What's going on?

41:07.168 --> 41:08.702
Oh, shit!

41:09.870 --> 41:11.504
Back up,
back up, back up, back up!

41:18.579 --> 41:19.980
Shit.

41:24.685 --> 41:25.118
Zack, let's go.
Let's go.

41:31.392 --> 41:34.260
Zack, let's go!
Let's go! Fuck! Come on!

41:34.261 --> 41:36.963
There you are,
fucking sucker!
Yeah, take it!

41:36.964 --> 41:38.131
Take it! Take it!

41:38.132 --> 41:39.466
<i>Good morning.</i>

42:14.535 --> 42:16.169
Brandy.

42:16.170 --> 42:17.704
You're gonna die.

42:19.874 --> 42:21.608
- Brandy.
- Walk away.

42:21.609 --> 42:22.375
Brandy.

42:24.478 --> 42:25.779
It's time to play!

42:27.348 --> 42:28.815
Get the fuck away from me!

42:28.816 --> 42:30.016
Oh, shit!

42:30.017 --> 42:31.651
Die! You're gonna die!

42:35.156 --> 42:37.290
I think it's a little weird
that they knew my name.

42:37.291 --> 42:40.260
Someone probably told them
to say that to freak you out.

42:50.304 --> 42:51.805
Wait, what?

42:51.806 --> 42:53.807
- Why didn't you say anything?

42:53.808 --> 42:56.342
Honestly, because
you guys get so scared
about everything.

42:56.343 --> 42:58.078
I wanted to make sure
you could go
through the haunt.

42:58.079 --> 42:59.145
Zack's the one...

42:59.146 --> 43:00.246
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

43:00.247 --> 43:01.614
Ask them.

43:01.615 --> 43:02.515
Zack,
where we going tomorrow?

43:04.885 --> 43:06.352
Have you told him?

43:06.353 --> 43:08.354
It was a haunted house
down in the south somewhere.

43:10.458 --> 43:12.559
I don't know if
it was in Alabama
or wherever it was on.

43:12.560 --> 43:16.096
We have a forum, chat room,
for haunted house owners.

43:16.097 --> 43:18.665
And, uh, there was a, um...

43:18.666 --> 43:21.568
A younger kid
that was in a scene,
where it was a hanging scene,

43:21.569 --> 43:23.903
and he had replaced
the breakaway noose

43:23.904 --> 43:26.172
that was in
the scene with his own,

43:26.173 --> 43:28.675
but he accidentally
hung himself.

43:28.676 --> 43:30.543
<i>Um, and it was
part of the show.</i>

43:30.544 --> 43:33.513
And by the time
they were able to
take care of the situation...

43:33.514 --> 43:34.948
I mean, he was already dead.

43:34.949 --> 43:36.850
This was,
like, in a haunted house?

43:36.851 --> 43:38.685
This was in
a haunted house while
the haunted house was open.

43:48.429 --> 43:50.730
...or should I get Skittles?

43:50.731 --> 43:52.365
This is all garbage food,
all garbage food.

43:52.366 --> 43:53.967
Or should I get
Sour Patch Kids?

43:53.968 --> 43:55.802
Yeah,
I don't think any of your...

43:55.803 --> 43:58.171
Or should I get a big pickle?

43:58.172 --> 43:59.372
So, are we off the 20?

43:59.373 --> 44:00.740
What is a good name

44:00.741 --> 44:01.708
- for a city?
- Where's the haunt?

44:01.709 --> 44:02.675
What city is the haunt in?

44:02.676 --> 44:03.977
That is not what I know.

44:03.978 --> 44:05.578
Not our job.
Not our job.

44:05.579 --> 44:07.180
Look how creepy...

44:07.181 --> 44:08.548
Look how creepy this is.

44:08.549 --> 44:10.083
- I love this.
- What the hell is that?

44:10.084 --> 44:11.518
And he's combing his hair?

44:11.519 --> 44:14.487
We're going
to find these places that...

44:14.488 --> 44:16.789
I don't know
what goes on if they

44:16.790 --> 44:19.025
use real body parts
or whatever.

44:19.026 --> 44:21.628
Real body parts,
that doesn't scare me,
though, like...

44:21.629 --> 44:23.229
I'm not going to
know the difference.

44:23.230 --> 44:24.864
If a real human leg...

44:24.865 --> 44:27.500
But I won't know
if it's a real human leg

44:27.501 --> 44:29.102
or it's a fake human leg,
so it's not...

44:29.103 --> 44:30.136
That doesn't bother me because
I don't know the truth anyway.

44:31.805 --> 44:33.940
What someone's idea
of what scary is,

44:35.809 --> 44:38.011
is totally different
to somebody else.

44:38.012 --> 44:41.014
Is it dressing up the walls,
with blood dripping off
and all that stuff?

44:41.015 --> 44:42.382
I don't need all that.

44:42.383 --> 44:45.552
Mine's more like,
real shit, dark.

44:45.553 --> 44:47.587
I don't know where I'm going,
I don't know what's happening.

44:47.588 --> 44:49.422
The intricate details to me
isn't that big of a deal.

44:49.423 --> 44:50.890
Where are you going?

44:50.891 --> 44:51.524
Why do you care?

44:51.959 --> 44:54.928
Who you talking to?

44:56.230 --> 44:57.430
Chantelle.

44:57.431 --> 44:58.865
Yeah,
I got something good for him.

45:01.135 --> 45:01.768
All right. All right.

45:04.004 --> 45:05.939
This is Mikey's surprise,
give him a clue.

45:05.940 --> 45:07.340
I did.
You gotta think about it.

45:07.341 --> 45:09.709
I mean, think about
the theme of this trip.

45:09.710 --> 45:10.710
Think about some
place Mikey loves
and just combine the two.

45:13.247 --> 45:14.581
Dude, it's like some
Halloween theme thing.

45:17.117 --> 45:19.319
Mikey,
are you into weird stuff?

45:19.320 --> 45:21.421
Absolutely,
but I don't know if they're
gonna let us go in there.

45:21.422 --> 45:23.823
Oh, hold on.
Look what he's...

45:23.824 --> 45:25.358
Yes.
How old is that lady?

45:25.359 --> 45:27.994
50-year veteran stripper.

45:39.306 --> 45:40.707
Jeffrey,
is this your first time?

45:40.708 --> 45:42.408
No...
Yeah, my first year
out of Florida.

45:42.409 --> 45:43.576
Look at all that.

45:43.577 --> 45:45.912
Insert them in, or... Okay.

45:45.913 --> 45:48.982
All my research pays off
on haunted houses
and strip clubs.

45:48.983 --> 45:50.650
All right,
let's have some fun.
Love it.

45:50.651 --> 45:51.784
Brandy, you ready?

45:51.785 --> 45:54.854
I mean, get crazy,
like, let's get nutty.

45:55.923 --> 45:57.690
Yeah!

45:58.926 --> 46:00.226
Getting some!

46:02.997 --> 46:04.297
Come on, honey...

46:04.298 --> 46:05.365
This is kind of hot.

46:06.533 --> 46:08.801
Very exotic.

46:10.137 --> 46:12.372
Zombie strippers?
Are you fucking kidding me?

46:20.481 --> 46:20.647
All right!

46:21.615 --> 46:23.916
Whoo-hoo!

46:30.791 --> 46:34.427
Fuck Christmas,
this is Halloween!

46:34.428 --> 46:37.096
And then
Jeff with four girls, dude.

46:37.097 --> 46:39.766
I mean, Jesus,
he almost swallowed a tit.

46:39.767 --> 46:41.301
I thought it was
going to kill him.

46:41.302 --> 46:42.769
I think she really liked me.

46:44.238 --> 46:47.006
- Look at your jeans, man.
- A little extra starch.

46:48.909 --> 46:50.343
You guys are
fucking disgusting.

47:03.390 --> 47:04.090
Come out!

47:09.630 --> 47:11.464
Be a part of this.
Come on.

47:11.465 --> 47:12.732
Ahhh!

47:12.733 --> 47:14.033
Are you coming or not?

47:17.971 --> 47:19.839
Can we just roll through,

47:19.840 --> 47:21.674
just taking
a couple snap pictures?

47:21.675 --> 47:23.209
No.
No, you can't do that.

47:23.210 --> 47:25.611
You can't have any cameras,
no pictures. I'm sorry.

47:25.612 --> 47:27.613
This one's free.

47:27.614 --> 47:29.482
Dude, you can't do
that shit in San Antonio.

47:29.483 --> 47:31.851
Tell him about that
thing in Louisiana.

47:31.852 --> 47:33.786
Hey, I heard about
something in Louisiana.

47:33.787 --> 47:34.220
So, outside of it,
like, would you guys go out
after you get off work?

47:37.624 --> 47:38.791
Um, some of us do.

47:38.792 --> 47:39.859
I'm just... I'm bored...

47:39.860 --> 47:41.761
Doin' this.

47:41.762 --> 47:43.930
Dude, it was crazy, dude.

47:43.931 --> 47:45.164
What?

47:45.165 --> 47:46.566
What, did you guys
pay money to do it?

47:46.567 --> 47:49.302
Yeah, it's like a tour,
like San Antonio...
It's like...

47:49.303 --> 47:50.903
Have you ever
made out with guys,

47:50.904 --> 47:52.438
like, in the haunt,
all dressed up?

47:52.439 --> 47:54.140
o.
- Never?

47:54.141 --> 47:55.908
- No, I have never made out with anybody at the haunt.
-  No.

47:55.909 --> 47:57.610
- You never...
- It's like kissing
my brothers.

47:57.611 --> 47:59.212
Um...

47:59.213 --> 48:00.947
Is it...
Is it...

48:00.948 --> 48:03.015
Is it something
skeleton or skull,
we heard?

48:03.016 --> 48:04.217
- Yeah.
- That's what it's called?

48:04.218 --> 48:05.284
Yeah, something
like blue skeleton.

48:05.285 --> 48:07.653
Have you ever hooked up
with make-up on?

48:07.654 --> 48:09.822
Uh, no. No, actually, never.

48:09.823 --> 48:11.124
- Seems hot.
- No, because, they're...

48:11.125 --> 48:12.625
You guys have to
tell me about this.

48:12.626 --> 48:14.494
Okay. See, I'm with
all this group of people,

48:14.495 --> 48:16.329
and they're, like,
getting pissed with me

48:16.330 --> 48:17.697
'cause I keep taking
them places like this.

48:17.698 --> 48:19.165
We're trying to
find something extreme.

48:19.166 --> 48:20.666
--Show me.

48:20.667 --> 48:22.168
- Show you?
- Yeah, let me see it.

48:22.169 --> 48:23.569
Okay.

48:23.570 --> 48:25.204
I want to see you
contort your body.

48:25.205 --> 48:27.073
Well, I would have
to take this off.

48:27.074 --> 48:29.142
I'm not worried
about that.

48:29.143 --> 48:30.109
Oh, shit, that's hot.

48:31.412 --> 48:32.545
You got a hot thong on.

48:34.748 --> 48:35.815
- Well, yeah.
- What do you...

48:35.816 --> 48:37.083
Turn around.
What are your tattoos?

48:37.084 --> 48:39.786
It's a lot harder.
I have a, um...

48:39.787 --> 48:41.454
You guys are
my best friends.

48:41.455 --> 48:42.655
Yeah, brother.
Good luck.

48:42.656 --> 48:43.823
All right.
Thank you, guys.

48:43.824 --> 48:44.991
Awesome.

48:44.992 --> 48:46.125
Can I touch your face?

48:46.126 --> 48:47.293
Sure.

48:49.496 --> 48:50.329
That's awesome.

49:10.250 --> 49:11.617
Sweet.

49:11.618 --> 49:13.152
Haunted words.

49:23.564 --> 49:25.465
- Hey, I found it.
- What?

49:25.466 --> 49:26.866
- I found the Blue Skeleton.
- Yeah, dude...

49:26.867 --> 49:28.167
Where?

49:28.168 --> 49:29.802
Uh, this place that they said.
San Antonio.

49:29.803 --> 49:31.404
And then his
other friend goes,
"Fuck San Antonio!"

49:31.405 --> 49:33.272
He goes, "Tell him about that
crazy place we went to."

49:33.273 --> 49:35.308
And I was, like,
"Hey, was it
called Skull Skeleton?"

49:35.309 --> 49:37.176
He goes, "Blue Skeleton."

49:37.177 --> 49:39.846
And they went last year.
And he said it's in
Louisiana this year.

49:39.847 --> 49:41.914
Hey, we got it. We got it.

49:41.915 --> 49:43.950
We're done.
We're going to Blue Skeleton.

49:43.951 --> 49:45.485
We can go through
with two different cameras...

49:45.486 --> 49:47.019
No, but we
gotta get to the end...

49:47.020 --> 49:48.488
We got more places to go to.

49:48.489 --> 49:49.722
Look, I don't know exactly...

49:49.723 --> 49:51.557
Where ya'll going?
What are ya'll doing?

49:51.558 --> 49:53.192
Yeah, I'm talkin'
to you, Biggin'.

49:53.193 --> 49:54.827
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

49:54.828 --> 49:56.696
What are you doing?

49:56.697 --> 49:57.763
I knew you were
filming in there.
Give me the tape.

49:57.764 --> 49:58.965
I didn't...

49:58.966 --> 50:00.666
Dude, I went through
one time with no camera.

50:00.667 --> 50:02.101
Dude? Do I look like a dude?
I look like a clown, son!

50:02.102 --> 50:04.303
Now, what were you
doing in there?

50:04.304 --> 50:06.038
- We were just hanging.
- Yeah, we were just...

50:06.039 --> 50:07.974
- We went through
your haunt.
- Just hanging? Just hanging?

50:07.975 --> 50:09.208
Just hanging?

50:09.209 --> 50:10.510
Just hanging with
the big shitty talk?

50:10.511 --> 50:12.111
Whatever!
Where are the tapes?

50:12.112 --> 50:13.246
I know you were recording.

50:13.247 --> 50:14.580
We didn't
record anything.

50:14.581 --> 50:15.915
You told us to put
the camera off...

50:15.916 --> 50:18.584
I know you
were recording.

50:18.585 --> 50:19.785
Dude, we didn't record.

50:19.786 --> 50:21.187
Do you remember
yesterday?

50:21.188 --> 50:22.889
I wasn't born then!

50:22.890 --> 50:24.724
And fuckin' back up
and stop. Relax.

50:24.725 --> 50:26.526
You want me to
fuck and back up?

50:26.527 --> 50:28.861
- That is illegal
in this state.
- Fuck you. Just...

50:28.862 --> 50:30.796
- Hey, dude, stop! Relax.
- You gotta get used
to some sodomy...

50:30.797 --> 50:32.365
Prepare for some sodomy

50:32.366 --> 50:33.866
because I'm
about to fuck you up!

50:33.867 --> 50:35.167
Hey, dude,
you don't want...

50:35.168 --> 50:36.402
You do not want to
get him pissed off.

50:36.403 --> 50:37.570
I wanna get
him pissed off,

50:37.571 --> 50:39.739
- you pissed off,
and fuck her.
- No, you don't.

50:39.740 --> 50:40.973
You look ridiculous.

50:40.974 --> 50:42.341
- You need to...
- Back the fuck up,
get out of here.

50:42.342 --> 50:44.176
- Brandy, go inside, now!
- Okay.

50:44.177 --> 50:46.379
- Back up.
- You heard me.
I've said my piece.

50:46.380 --> 50:47.980
Get on before I hurt you.

50:50.150 --> 50:51.417
No,
that's the second time

50:51.418 --> 50:52.952
one of these guys
have got in my face.

50:52.953 --> 50:55.021
I swear to God, dude,
I'm gonna knock one of
these guys the fuck out!

50:55.022 --> 50:57.056
Maybe you shouldn't
make a sex tape
with his sister.

50:57.057 --> 50:57.223
Oh, come on, man,
he didn't know that
I was filming her.

50:59.126 --> 51:00.493
Beer wench.

51:11.538 --> 51:13.639
We should do
a different handshake
that's like...

51:13.640 --> 51:14.507
- Oh...
- Brandy, can you make...

51:19.179 --> 51:20.379
No.

51:20.380 --> 51:20.880
Oh...

51:22.482 --> 51:24.350
No, I don't like that.

51:25.886 --> 51:27.320
That wouldn't
catch on?
No.

51:27.321 --> 51:28.487
Oh...

51:28.488 --> 51:30.423
Oh,
where are those tongs?

53:30.010 --> 53:32.978
How far would they go
to scare somebody? You know...

53:32.979 --> 53:34.947
They will go pretty far.

53:34.948 --> 53:37.650
They will go pretty far
to breaking their leg,
breaking their back,

53:37.651 --> 53:39.852
<i>doing anything
they possibly can
to get a scare.</i>

53:39.853 --> 53:42.021
Do you think that
you have a stopping point?

53:43.523 --> 53:44.790
Uh...

53:45.926 --> 53:47.159
A stopping point...

53:47.160 --> 53:49.562
I have been asked,
and I have done

53:49.563 --> 53:51.864
many different
things over the years.

53:51.865 --> 53:54.433
We've heard rumors
you were using dead bodies.

53:54.434 --> 53:56.836
I'm not surprised,
to be honest.

53:56.837 --> 53:57.169
I'm not surprised.
That's actually scary.

53:59.740 --> 54:00.573
Real dead bodies?

54:02.342 --> 54:03.743
Hmm.

54:04.845 --> 54:06.545
Not far, from what I've heard.

54:06.546 --> 54:08.547
Zacharias,
you hear anything last night?

54:10.684 --> 54:14.019
No. Come back here
for a sec, though.

54:14.020 --> 54:16.555
What are you doing?
Close up for a J.O. session?

54:16.556 --> 54:18.691
Yeah. Close the door.

54:18.692 --> 54:19.892
What do you mean,
"Close the door"? Why?

54:19.893 --> 54:21.093
Just close the door.

54:21.094 --> 54:22.862
This was posted
in a haunt chat
room last night.

54:22.863 --> 54:24.296
Dude, what?

54:24.297 --> 54:26.732
I've watched this
thing three times.

54:26.733 --> 54:28.834
Every single one of us
is in this video.

54:28.835 --> 54:30.536
How would you
have filmed this?

54:30.537 --> 54:31.003
Look.

54:32.939 --> 54:34.974
That's me.
Were you filming me
while I was asleep?

54:34.975 --> 54:37.910
I'm trying to figure
out how you filmed it,
unless Michael did it.

54:37.911 --> 54:40.146
But I just...
Michael's right before you.

54:40.147 --> 54:42.248
I'm in bed with Brandy,
there's Jeff...

54:42.249 --> 54:44.049
I can't explain this.

54:44.050 --> 54:45.818
And how's it online?

54:45.819 --> 54:47.853
This isn't...
What are you...

54:47.854 --> 54:50.022
The only thing I
can think of is,
this is just a part of it,

54:50.023 --> 54:51.991
- so we're just
gonna have to...
- Part of it?

54:51.992 --> 54:53.559
This is not a haunt.

54:53.560 --> 54:55.494
Dude, we're not in a haunt,
we're in the middle
of nowhere in our RV.

54:55.495 --> 54:57.663
- Yeah, I know.
- These guys came in here.

54:57.664 --> 54:59.832
Do not say a fucking word
or they will all go home.

54:59.833 --> 55:01.734
You guys seen
my license around?

55:01.735 --> 55:02.701
What are you wearing, dude?

55:05.005 --> 55:06.739
Real men wear pink.

55:06.740 --> 55:08.541
Those look like
Brandy's panties.

55:08.542 --> 55:09.775
You've never
seen my panties.

55:09.776 --> 55:11.110
Brandy's granny panties.

55:11.111 --> 55:12.545
- I blacked out last night.
- It could have been her.

55:12.546 --> 55:14.013
What do you mean,
"blacked out"?

55:14.014 --> 55:15.414
What the fuck!

55:15.415 --> 55:17.716
What the fuck is...

55:17.717 --> 55:19.218
What are
you doing, dude?

55:19.219 --> 55:20.953
What's going on, Michael?

55:20.954 --> 55:22.488
What the fuck are you doing?

55:22.489 --> 55:23.956
- What the fuck is that?
- Should I pull over?

55:23.957 --> 55:25.391
What do you mean,
"What is that?"

55:25.392 --> 55:26.225
What the fuck?

55:27.494 --> 55:29.261
- What is it?

55:29.262 --> 55:30.596
What the fuck is that?

55:30.597 --> 55:31.931
Is that a heart?

55:33.066 --> 55:34.166
- God, Michael!
- Jesus!

55:34.167 --> 55:36.802
Jesus Christ,
are you okay?

55:36.803 --> 55:38.537
- Is this you?
- Michael...

55:38.538 --> 55:40.339
Why the fuck is
he puking in here?

55:40.340 --> 55:41.907
Zack, You did that?

55:41.908 --> 55:43.075
Zack?

55:43.076 --> 55:44.176
Jesus Christ!

55:44.177 --> 55:45.811
What is that?

55:46.947 --> 55:48.614
I have no fucking idea.

55:48.615 --> 55:50.182
Don't touch it.
Don't touch it!

55:50.183 --> 55:51.450
Well,
I'm not keeping it in here.

55:51.685 --> 55:54.653
Shit.

55:55.822 --> 55:57.489
- God,
that's so gross.

55:59.593 --> 56:01.093
Fucking idiots, dude.

56:01.094 --> 56:02.862
I didn't do this.

56:02.863 --> 56:03.929
Yeah, you didn't do it.

56:09.636 --> 56:10.870
What are you doing?

56:10.871 --> 56:13.138
Nothing.
I'm just waiting for you, man.

56:13.139 --> 56:14.206
Let's go.

56:17.477 --> 56:18.644
None of you guys are ready.

56:18.645 --> 56:20.412
And Mikey's
being difficult. Still.

56:20.413 --> 56:21.580
Are you all right?

56:21.581 --> 56:23.082
No, I'm not.

56:23.083 --> 56:24.416
Let's go.
- This is just...
I don't want to do it.

56:24.417 --> 56:25.751
Jeff, you done?

56:41.334 --> 56:43.402
Hey, I got the email.

56:43.403 --> 56:45.437
- We're doing the forum?
- Yeah.

56:45.438 --> 56:46.005
All right.

56:48.642 --> 56:51.510
If you want to move closer,
head toward Baton Rouge.

56:51.511 --> 56:54.446
Ask for Giggles
at the D&D Bar.

56:54.447 --> 56:55.514
Baton Rouge?

56:55.515 --> 56:56.782
Yeah.

56:56.783 --> 56:59.018
It's...
It's part of the thing.

56:59.019 --> 57:00.152
You're the very one that
wants to stop going to
the Mickey Mouse places.

57:02.555 --> 57:03.422
All right.

57:04.491 --> 57:06.158
Huh?

57:06.159 --> 57:08.160
There it is.
Now you're going
to get your chance, tough guy.

57:12.899 --> 57:15.701
Look at all
those trash bag pumpkins.

57:19.539 --> 57:20.706
This is a bar?

57:20.941 --> 57:23.909
Zack?

57:25.245 --> 57:28.480
I'm sorry, guys,
but this is where
they said to go.

57:28.481 --> 57:30.516
He said to ask
the guy at the bar.

57:36.089 --> 57:39.191
Hey, uh, excuse me.

57:39.192 --> 57:40.626
Sorry to bother you guys.
Uh, I'm supposed
to find a Giggles.

57:42.796 --> 57:44.196
- You know?
- Giggles?

57:45.732 --> 57:47.800
Yeah.
I know Giggles.

57:47.801 --> 57:50.135
Oh, yeah. He hangs out here
quite regularly,
matter of fact.

57:50.136 --> 57:51.704
You all want to
take a seat over there

57:51.705 --> 57:53.872
and make yourselves at home.
He'll be here shortly.

57:53.873 --> 57:54.606
Yeah.

57:56.109 --> 57:58.210
Sit.

58:04.250 --> 58:06.185
At least we're on
the right track.

58:06.186 --> 58:08.187
Look at
the couple slow dancing.

58:08.188 --> 58:09.488
So weird.

58:10.724 --> 58:12.458
You guys want a drink,
at least?

58:13.994 --> 58:15.427
- Beer.
- Jeff, you want a beer?

58:15.428 --> 58:16.862
Yeah.

58:16.863 --> 58:18.063
It's just a scare...

58:18.064 --> 58:20.399
Hey! What's that camera for?

58:30.944 --> 58:32.978
They're cool, the bar.

58:32.979 --> 58:34.513
Happy with that
kind of service.

58:34.514 --> 58:37.016
Besides, they don't...
They don't like our kind.

58:41.921 --> 58:43.922
Holy shit. Turn around.
Turn around, Brandy!

58:43.923 --> 58:44.223
- What? What?
- Turn around.

58:45.792 --> 58:47.626
Oh, my God.

58:52.432 --> 58:53.599
Wow.

59:15.789 --> 59:17.689
Are you Giggles?

59:25.098 --> 59:27.099
Hey!
All right,
I'll turn it off!

59:27.100 --> 59:27.966
Try that here.

59:31.304 --> 59:33.605
That guy was
having a good time.

59:36.376 --> 59:38.143
You looked like you
were having a good time.

59:38.144 --> 59:39.912
- What?
Okay,
I'm going to the bathroom.

59:39.913 --> 59:40.846
What?

59:42.048 --> 59:44.783
- Hey, we're gonna...
- What's going on, guys?

59:46.319 --> 59:47.619
- We're gonna...
- No, no, no, no, no.

59:47.620 --> 59:48.821
You want to meet
Mr. Giggles?
He's outside.

59:48.822 --> 59:50.222
Yes.

59:50.223 --> 59:52.057
He won't talk till
the camera is off,
so put it down.

59:52.058 --> 59:54.059
- Sit down.
- It's gonna be you.

59:54.060 --> 59:55.594
Finally.

59:55.595 --> 59:57.096
This is not a good idea.

01:00:00.467 --> 01:00:01.900
Oh, man, check this out.

01:00:01.901 --> 01:00:03.268
What you got there?

01:00:03.269 --> 01:00:05.037
City boys
forgot their camera.

01:00:05.038 --> 01:00:06.638
Oh, cool.
Let's go make a movie.

01:00:06.639 --> 01:00:08.173
Yeah, let's make a movie.

01:00:16.316 --> 01:00:17.683
Hey, guys,
this is the ladies' room.

01:00:17.684 --> 01:00:19.518
Well, yeah, we know.
How you doing?

01:00:19.519 --> 01:00:21.086
Ugh, what are you doing?

01:00:21.087 --> 01:00:22.554
We're shooting
a little video.

01:00:22.555 --> 01:00:24.723
Thought that's
what y'all like.

01:00:24.724 --> 01:00:27.092
Well, it's not what we're...
It's not what
we're here to do.

01:00:27.093 --> 01:00:28.594
We decided to
shoot a little movie.

01:00:28.595 --> 01:00:30.028
Did Bobby and Zack
set you up for this?

01:00:30.029 --> 01:00:31.630
Heard you were
looking for Mr. Giggles.

01:00:31.631 --> 01:00:33.432
I got your Mr. Giggles
for you right here, darling.

01:00:33.433 --> 01:00:35.033
Stop.

01:00:35.034 --> 01:00:36.668
- Could you just...
- Huh?

01:00:36.669 --> 01:00:38.504
Just leave the rest room.

01:00:38.505 --> 01:00:40.772
Uh, we're good.
We're doing all right.
Stop!

01:00:40.773 --> 01:00:42.574
Just stop! Guys, get out!

01:00:42.575 --> 01:00:44.209
- Come on, huh?
- What's the matter?

01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:45.544
Just trying
to have a little fun.

01:00:45.545 --> 01:00:46.812
Bobby.

01:00:46.813 --> 01:00:48.213
They cornered me in there.

01:00:48.214 --> 01:00:49.715
What the fuck
you guys doing?

01:00:49.716 --> 01:00:51.283
- Shooting a movie, boy.
- Shooting a movie.

01:00:51.284 --> 01:00:52.551
That's our camera.
What are you talking about?

01:00:52.552 --> 01:00:53.952
We're making a movie.

01:00:53.953 --> 01:00:57.055
Let's go, let's go...

01:00:57.056 --> 01:01:00.159
- I'm not saying it's you.
- It's on all of us, all right?

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.060
But it's getting out
of hand, all right?

01:01:02.061 --> 01:01:04.429
They're filming us,
they're posting
this shit online.

01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:06.198
Fucking getting
in Mike's face.

01:01:06.199 --> 01:01:07.332
But then when
they go after Brandy,

01:01:07.333 --> 01:01:09.101
that's a whole
different story, man.

01:01:09.102 --> 01:01:09.301
We can never
leave her alone again.

01:01:11.304 --> 01:01:13.438
They were asking me
for my Facebook,
and I got theirs.

01:01:15.308 --> 01:01:17.709
We were talking
about Extreme Haunts.

01:01:17.710 --> 01:01:20.312
And they said that they were
looking for the same shit.

01:01:20.313 --> 01:01:22.080
I don't know.
They were just, like,

01:01:22.081 --> 01:01:23.715
"Hey, let's exchange
information if you find..."

01:01:23.716 --> 01:01:25.150
They knew what we
were talking about?

01:01:25.151 --> 01:01:26.618
Yeah. They said
they've heard of 'em.

01:01:26.619 --> 01:01:28.353
Well, then you're gonna
need to Facebook 'em.

01:01:28.354 --> 01:01:29.821
'Cause we have
the information.

01:01:29.822 --> 01:01:31.156
It's in Louisiana this year.

01:01:31.157 --> 01:01:32.424
We don't have
an address, though.

01:01:32.425 --> 01:01:33.725
- It doesn't matter.
- You know, I'm down,

01:01:33.726 --> 01:01:34.993
- but we don't have an address.
- It doesn't matter.

01:01:34.994 --> 01:01:36.228
--I have...

01:01:36.229 --> 01:01:38.697
- These websites. I'm in...
- Shh, what was that?

01:01:38.698 --> 01:01:40.265
Yeah, but Zack,
that's like nothing.

01:01:40.266 --> 01:01:41.867
Brandy,
when I say Louisiana,
that's where it is...

01:01:41.868 --> 01:01:43.802
--What was that?

01:01:43.803 --> 01:01:45.070
You guys,
there's somebody outside.

01:01:46.206 --> 01:01:48.540
Look out the windows.

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:55.480
It's so hard to see.
Can you even see...

01:01:57.016 --> 01:01:58.717
- Shit!
- You guys,
there's somebody out there!

01:01:58.718 --> 01:01:59.952
Brandy, stay here.

01:01:59.953 --> 01:02:01.520
- What was that?
- Shh...

01:02:03.156 --> 01:02:05.791
- Somebody is on the roof.
- Where?

01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:08.660
Shh.

01:02:08.661 --> 01:02:09.695
--Shh.

01:02:12.665 --> 01:02:14.566
--Jeff...

01:02:14.567 --> 01:02:16.201
Be quiet. Shh...

01:02:16.202 --> 01:02:18.670
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

01:02:21.507 --> 01:02:22.874
Holy shit. Holy shit.

01:02:22.875 --> 01:02:24.309
What just happened?

01:02:24.310 --> 01:02:26.178
Bobby... Bobby, get it.
Jeff, why is the power out?

01:02:26.179 --> 01:02:27.479
Is the door locked?
Is the door locked?

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:29.314
Yes, it's locked!

01:02:31.317 --> 01:02:33.352
Go turn it on.

01:02:33.353 --> 01:02:35.354
What do you
see out the window?
I don't see shit.

01:02:35.355 --> 01:02:37.189
- I can't see anything.
- Brandy, just stay here.

01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:38.557
Okay.

01:02:38.558 --> 01:02:39.858
Do not leave
anybody's side.

01:02:39.859 --> 01:02:41.727
Stay away from the sun roof.

01:02:41.728 --> 01:02:44.029
Or,
if I try the engine, dude,
it'll charge the generator.

01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:45.864
- Try it!
- I'll just try it. Hold on.

01:02:45.865 --> 01:02:47.065
Brandy, stay back.

01:02:48.701 --> 01:02:49.635
Shit!

01:02:51.271 --> 01:02:53.405
What the fuck?

01:02:53.406 --> 01:02:55.073
Bobby, they are every...
They are all around us.

01:02:55.074 --> 01:02:57.109
You guys,
what is going on?

01:02:59.312 --> 01:03:00.912
What the fuck is going on?

01:03:00.913 --> 01:03:02.314
What the...
Jesus, Bobby!

01:03:02.315 --> 01:03:04.116
They're outside our...

01:03:04.117 --> 01:03:05.450
- Right up against
the window over there!
Seriously!

01:03:05.451 --> 01:03:06.685
- What the fuck?
- Where'd they go?

01:03:06.686 --> 01:03:07.753
Where did they go?

01:03:07.754 --> 01:03:09.087
There were, like,
50 of them...

01:03:09.088 --> 01:03:10.555
- Shut the back.
- ...and they just disappeared.

01:03:10.556 --> 01:03:12.157
Go to the back
and lock the door.

01:03:12.158 --> 01:03:14.059
Did they go on the sides?

01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:15.894
- Guys, do you see that?
- I don't know...

01:03:15.895 --> 01:03:17.996
They are starting to phase out
a lot of the traditional stuff

01:03:21.334 --> 01:03:23.702
and starting to go
into this extreme stuff.

01:03:23.703 --> 01:03:25.837
<i>- If I've got a group of...
- Help!</i>

01:03:25.838 --> 01:03:27.539
--...six or eight, you know,
21-year-old males

01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:29.541
<i>and a guy comes up to me
and tugs on my sleeve,</i>

01:03:29.542 --> 01:03:31.343
<i>and he says,
"Hey, I want it hardcore,"</i>

01:03:31.344 --> 01:03:33.078
we'll run him through there.

01:03:33.079 --> 01:03:36.682
I mean, I'll tell the guy,
"I'll do everything
short of killing you."

01:03:36.683 --> 01:03:38.650
<i>And they're, like,
"That's what we want.
That's what we want."</i>

01:03:38.651 --> 01:03:41.053
And I'll go in there,
and we'll tear 'em up.

01:03:41.054 --> 01:03:44.323
We're almost to the point
where we're gonna cuss these
people and gang-rape them.

01:03:51.364 --> 01:03:51.897
Brandy,
you doing okay?

01:03:53.433 --> 01:03:55.434
Come on, it's our last day.

01:03:57.136 --> 01:03:58.470
See a smile on that face.

01:04:00.306 --> 01:04:01.907
That's our
Halloween breakfast?

01:04:03.176 --> 01:04:04.409
Yeah.

01:04:04.410 --> 01:04:05.644
Halloween is
just like Christmas.

01:04:05.645 --> 01:04:06.845
You get Christmas breakfast.

01:04:06.846 --> 01:04:07.946
Halloween breakfast.

01:04:07.947 --> 01:04:09.648
Jack-o-lantern
pancakes then.

01:04:09.649 --> 01:04:12.351
Can everybody have
a good time today, please?

01:04:13.586 --> 01:04:14.720
Jesus Christ.

01:04:15.855 --> 01:04:17.222
What the fuck was that?

01:04:17.223 --> 01:04:18.457
Do not go outside yet.

01:04:18.458 --> 01:04:18.824
Dude... Dude...

01:04:19.659 --> 01:04:22.427
- Yeah...
- I'm going.

01:04:24.163 --> 01:04:25.731
Do you see anybody?

01:04:28.401 --> 01:04:30.168
Why is there a pumpkin
in the middle of nowhere?

01:04:30.169 --> 01:04:31.603
Zack, get in...
What are you doing?

01:04:31.604 --> 01:04:33.572
- Get back in the RV.

01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:39.244
See anything?

01:04:39.245 --> 01:04:40.445
Somebody is here.

01:04:40.446 --> 01:04:42.447
I like it.
It says, "Carve me."

01:04:42.448 --> 01:04:44.049
Look what I have.

01:04:51.224 --> 01:04:52.424
I think they
went a little too far.

01:04:52.425 --> 01:04:54.326
Got a knife?

01:04:54.327 --> 01:04:56.495
I mean, we are
in the middle of nowhere,
and they found us?

01:04:56.496 --> 01:04:58.430
Yeah, this is what
you've been looking for.

01:05:03.503 --> 01:05:05.237
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

01:05:05.238 --> 01:05:07.205
Look what we have here.

01:05:08.641 --> 01:05:11.009
Stop being dramatic.
What is it?

01:05:11.010 --> 01:05:12.577
It's an invitation.

01:05:12.578 --> 01:05:13.745
Bourbon Street, 10:00 p.m.

01:05:15.782 --> 01:05:18.483
But, I mean how do you know
it's Blue Skeleton?
How the fuck...

01:05:18.484 --> 01:05:20.485
It's what
we've been wanting.

01:05:20.486 --> 01:05:22.020
It's insane now.
There'll be, like,
10,000 people down there.

01:05:22.021 --> 01:05:23.221
We gotta try it.

01:05:23.222 --> 01:05:25.924
One more day,
that's all I ask.
It's Halloween.

01:05:25.925 --> 01:05:27.259
We go home tomorrow, okay?

01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:28.560
Yeah, I don't know.

01:05:28.561 --> 01:05:29.995
We bring this
to protect us.

01:05:29.996 --> 01:05:31.263
Don't be
a smartass right now.

01:05:31.264 --> 01:05:32.397
We're going home tomorrow.

01:05:32.398 --> 01:05:33.765
Dude, this is what
we've been looking for.

01:05:33.766 --> 01:05:35.734
Yeah, we used to assume
that we were gonna go.

01:05:35.735 --> 01:05:36.868
We are going.

01:05:36.869 --> 01:05:38.170
You just... No, you...

01:05:38.171 --> 01:05:39.538
You don't give
anybody a chance to talk...

01:05:39.539 --> 01:05:41.139
You were really going
to get an invitation,

01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:42.641
and then just,
what are we going to do,

01:05:42.642 --> 01:05:44.643
go drink tonight
at a bar?

01:05:44.644 --> 01:05:46.578
This is what we've
been looking for,
for a week.

01:05:46.579 --> 01:05:47.078
It's Halloween.
We go.

01:05:47.947 --> 01:05:50.715
- Holy shit.
- Wow.

01:05:53.085 --> 01:05:55.153
Guys, it's so cool.

01:05:55.154 --> 01:05:56.855
I have the weird...
That's weird.
Halloween.

01:05:56.856 --> 01:05:58.957
That's really...

01:05:58.958 --> 01:06:01.359
That means people
were out here last night
putting those in.

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:02.494
Zack, go get 'em.

01:06:02.495 --> 01:06:03.829
Wow.

01:06:03.830 --> 01:06:05.597
They were
sitting around the RV
while we were sleeping.

01:06:05.598 --> 01:06:07.399
Hey. Hey, you all right?

01:06:10.937 --> 01:06:12.671
Brandy,
let's go with it.

01:06:12.672 --> 01:06:13.872
Halloween time.

01:06:13.873 --> 01:06:15.173
Everybody take one.
Let's rock.

01:06:17.543 --> 01:06:18.844
- Ha!
- You're an idiot!

01:06:25.218 --> 01:06:27.385
That's not
what we set out to do,

01:06:27.386 --> 01:06:29.454
is to be fucking
surrounded in a field

01:06:29.455 --> 01:06:31.356
by fucking weirdos.

01:06:31.357 --> 01:06:33.725
Well, if you
kind of think about it,
it's kind of cool.

01:06:36.462 --> 01:06:38.730
You kidding me?

01:06:38.731 --> 01:06:40.098
- It's kind of cool.
- Kind of cool?

01:06:40.099 --> 01:06:41.533
There is such a difference,
though,

01:06:41.534 --> 01:06:44.002
in wanting extreme shit
and knowing, okay,

01:06:44.003 --> 01:06:46.438
we're going to do
an extreme haunted house,

01:06:46.439 --> 01:06:49.374
to brushing teeth
and getting ready to go to bed

01:06:49.375 --> 01:06:50.108
and be surrounded
by redneck hillbilly assholes

01:06:53.813 --> 01:06:55.347
that are, you know,
fucking with us.

01:06:55.348 --> 01:06:58.016
And that's not cool
when you don't
know what's going on.

01:06:58.017 --> 01:07:00.785
Nothing actually happened.

01:07:00.786 --> 01:07:02.821
Like, just calm down,
all right?

01:07:02.822 --> 01:07:05.323
You came on this trip,
you've seen this world,

01:07:05.324 --> 01:07:07.893
and now we've got
the opportunity to do
something really cool,

01:07:07.894 --> 01:07:09.027
so just relax.

01:07:38.991 --> 01:07:40.859
You see anybody
who has a skull mask,

01:07:40.860 --> 01:07:42.694
anything that looks
like it, let me know.

01:07:42.695 --> 01:07:44.563
Show me your tits!

01:07:44.564 --> 01:07:45.430
Thank you!

01:07:52.071 --> 01:07:54.406
It's not him.
It's not him.

01:07:59.579 --> 01:08:01.446
There's somebody up
there with a skull, Jeff.

01:08:01.447 --> 01:08:01.913
- Where?
- See him on the balcony?

01:08:11.657 --> 01:08:13.525
I swear I could see him.

01:08:23.469 --> 01:08:25.904
I'm not gonna walk down
this street again!

01:08:40.286 --> 01:08:42.386
Hey!

01:08:43.990 --> 01:08:45.624
- Brandy?

01:08:50.662 --> 01:08:52.096
Brandy!

01:09:02.875 --> 01:09:03.274
Hey... Bobby!

01:09:04.276 --> 01:09:06.411
Hey!

01:09:07.513 --> 01:09:09.113
Get him... Get him.

01:09:09.115 --> 01:09:10.180
Bobby!

01:09:10.182 --> 01:09:11.282
Hey, wait up!

01:09:12.618 --> 01:09:14.486
Hey, where you go...
Wait up!

01:09:16.455 --> 01:09:17.122
Bobby!

01:09:23.929 --> 01:09:25.430
You wanna
come out and play?

01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:36.573
Someone find my friends.

01:09:36.575 --> 01:09:36.941
Over here, boy.
What you looking at?

01:09:47.118 --> 01:09:48.286
Yeah!

01:09:50.555 --> 01:09:51.656
Bring your mouth!

01:09:53.693 --> 01:09:55.960
Put out your tongue
and say, "Ah."

01:10:22.455 --> 01:10:23.621
You guys going to call him?

01:10:23.622 --> 01:10:24.756
Yeah, Zack is.

01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:29.561
I called twice.

01:10:29.562 --> 01:10:30.962
What do you mean
you called twice?

01:10:30.963 --> 01:10:32.397
- Voice mail says...
- Whose voice mail?

01:10:32.398 --> 01:10:33.898
Jeff's voice mail!
It says,

01:10:33.899 --> 01:10:36.034
"If you want to go to
the Blue Skeleton..."

01:10:36.035 --> 01:10:38.203
That gave me an intersection
and said we gotta
be there by midnight.

01:10:51.751 --> 01:10:54.219
I can't believe
that we're actually going
to find this place, man.

01:11:12.638 --> 01:11:14.806
I can't say I know
what's going on, but just...

01:11:14.807 --> 01:11:15.473
We're in this together.

01:11:16.976 --> 01:11:19.477
Right, that's fine.
What are you looking for?

01:11:19.478 --> 01:11:19.644
Mike.

01:11:20.846 --> 01:11:23.414
I don't know where
the fuck Jeff is,

01:11:25.718 --> 01:11:27.952
I do not know
what is going on.

01:11:27.953 --> 01:11:30.989
We're either going to
the end of this road,
or going the fuck home.

01:11:30.990 --> 01:11:33.158
What do you want to do?
You want to
leave him out there?

01:11:33.159 --> 01:11:35.727
There's no
fucking chance.
He's up!

01:11:35.728 --> 01:11:38.463
I don't see
anything outside, though.

01:11:38.464 --> 01:11:39.964
Somebody is coming.

01:11:46.038 --> 01:11:48.306
Whoa.
Zack, what is this, man?

01:11:48.307 --> 01:11:49.841
What's going on?

01:11:49.842 --> 01:11:51.943
- What the...

01:11:53.946 --> 01:11:54.846
What are we gonna do?

01:11:58.984 --> 01:12:00.385
Oh, come on.

01:12:07.426 --> 01:12:09.060
This is... Fuck...

01:12:09.061 --> 01:12:09.661
What?

01:12:11.497 --> 01:12:14.766
"Sixty seconds, come outside,
or your friend will die."

01:12:14.767 --> 01:12:15.366
- It's a text message?
- What the fuck?

01:12:19.905 --> 01:12:21.673
This is not
all right, man.

01:12:24.844 --> 01:12:26.377
"Forty-five seconds."

01:12:28.547 --> 01:12:29.981
Fuck this, dude,
I'm not scared of them.

01:12:29.982 --> 01:12:31.449
Let's get out there.
This isn't real, right?

01:12:36.088 --> 01:12:37.288
Is this the haunt?
What is this?

01:12:37.289 --> 01:12:39.090
"You will be scared.
Thirty seconds."

01:12:39.091 --> 01:12:41.025
Can they fucking hear us?

01:12:41.026 --> 01:12:43.461
You guys,
what's going on here?

01:12:43.462 --> 01:12:45.463
It's...
It's just gotta be them.

01:12:45.464 --> 01:12:46.831
What else do we do?

01:12:46.832 --> 01:12:47.398
Zack?

01:12:48.701 --> 01:12:50.168
Dude, get back in the RV!

01:12:50.169 --> 01:12:51.236
Come on!

01:12:59.178 --> 01:12:59.410
Shit!

01:13:00.412 --> 01:13:02.680
"Surprise."

01:13:06.585 --> 01:13:08.586
What the hell
is going on?

01:13:08.587 --> 01:13:09.821
There is glass everywhere,
Bobby.

01:13:09.822 --> 01:13:11.289
Stay down, Brandy.

01:13:11.290 --> 01:13:14.292
Jesus-fucking-Christ!
Why are they doing this to us?

01:13:14.293 --> 01:13:16.995
Holy shit.

01:13:16.996 --> 01:13:18.596
- Stay down.
- Can you see Zack?

01:13:18.597 --> 01:13:19.264
--Holy shit.

01:13:20.799 --> 01:13:22.600
Get it.

01:13:27.773 --> 01:13:28.673
"Don't look up."

01:13:32.311 --> 01:13:33.745
What the fuck man?

01:13:36.181 --> 01:13:38.483
I don't want
to fucking play along!

01:13:38.484 --> 01:13:40.084
- Get off me!
- Get the fuck off!

01:13:40.085 --> 01:13:42.186
Do not fucking hurt her!

01:13:48.227 --> 01:13:49.460
Jesus Christ.

01:13:50.029 --> 01:13:52.797
Brandy?

01:14:00.773 --> 01:14:02.240
Brandy, stay close.

01:14:02.241 --> 01:14:03.608
Okay.

01:14:30.602 --> 01:14:32.737
Where are we going?

01:14:32.738 --> 01:14:34.272
Guys,
you know what this is.
Just relax.

01:14:36.842 --> 01:14:38.476
A little hard
to relax, Zack.

01:14:38.477 --> 01:14:40.011
Zack, shut the fuck up.

01:14:47.886 --> 01:14:49.020
Oh, my God.

01:14:49.021 --> 01:14:50.121
Ah, fuck!

01:14:50.122 --> 01:14:51.522
Get off me!

01:14:51.523 --> 01:14:53.558
What is going on, Mike?
What's happening?

01:14:53.559 --> 01:14:55.159
Get the fuck off me!

01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:56.761
--All right, All right.

01:14:58.497 --> 01:14:59.897
Jesus!

01:14:59.898 --> 01:15:02.533
All right. These guys
have got a fuckin' bat.

01:15:32.698 --> 01:15:34.599
- What?
- What's going on, Mike?

01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:36.968
Michael,
just do what they want.

01:15:36.969 --> 01:15:38.202
All right, all right.

01:15:48.614 --> 01:15:50.214
Michael?

01:15:55.888 --> 01:15:58.523
He's just
messing with you, Brandy.

01:16:01.193 --> 01:16:02.460
Okay.

01:16:02.461 --> 01:16:03.161
What's going on?

01:16:05.297 --> 01:16:08.499
- They are moving me outside.
- All right, I'll go!

01:16:10.536 --> 01:16:12.703
Hey Zack,
are you going too?

01:16:12.704 --> 01:16:14.072
I guess, are you?

01:16:14.073 --> 01:16:15.873
- No.
- Zack!

01:16:15.874 --> 01:16:18.543
Wait, you guys,
don't leave me in here alone.

01:16:18.544 --> 01:16:20.511
Zack,
bring her with you!

01:16:20.512 --> 01:16:21.479
You guys!

01:16:22.915 --> 01:16:24.682
- Brandy!
- Oh, shit.

01:16:24.683 --> 01:16:26.117
Brandy!

01:16:26.118 --> 01:16:27.919
Brandy!

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:29.454
Fucking shit!

01:16:29.455 --> 01:16:30.822
Brandy!

01:16:30.823 --> 01:16:32.156
- Brandy!
- Guys!

01:16:32.157 --> 01:16:32.290
- Guys!
- Brandy!

01:16:34.293 --> 01:16:35.626
Bring her out!

01:16:40.699 --> 01:16:43.935
Fuck, I don't want
to be here alone.

01:17:24.510 --> 01:17:26.310
Count to 30...

01:17:26.311 --> 01:17:27.678
...and remove your hood.

01:17:30.816 --> 01:17:33.050
There is going to
be a video camera

01:17:33.051 --> 01:17:33.684
sitting right next to you.

01:17:35.387 --> 01:17:37.021
Pick it up...

01:17:39.558 --> 01:17:42.393
...and record
everything you see.

01:17:43.829 --> 01:17:45.730
And remember...

01:17:47.266 --> 01:17:48.132
...we'll be watching.

01:18:52.397 --> 01:18:53.164
I can't see a goddamn thing.

01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:56.801
Oh, my God,
this is ridiculous.

01:18:59.271 --> 01:19:00.338
Shit.

01:19:07.379 --> 01:19:09.580
Zack?

01:19:11.049 --> 01:19:12.116
Bobby?

01:19:13.418 --> 01:19:15.453
I'm supposed to be filming.

01:19:17.689 --> 01:19:18.789
Oh, shit.

01:19:23.929 --> 01:19:26.330
Dammit.

01:19:26.331 --> 01:19:27.832
I swear to Christ,
Bobby, if y'all are
fucking with me...

01:19:29.901 --> 01:19:31.602
Honestly, I just
want to get the... Fuck!

01:19:35.307 --> 01:19:38.209
All right, look,
I'm fucking over this.

01:19:41.380 --> 01:19:44.482
All right, I'm done. I'm done!
What the fuck am
I supposed to do?

01:19:47.386 --> 01:19:48.919
Hello!

01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:49.620
Zack! Bobby!

01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:53.691
This is crazy shit.

01:19:56.895 --> 01:19:58.429
Hello?

01:19:58.430 --> 01:19:59.630
Hello?

01:20:00.932 --> 01:20:01.866
Fuck.

01:20:11.009 --> 01:20:13.611
Zack?

01:20:19.851 --> 01:20:21.986
Oh, fuck.

01:20:28.527 --> 01:20:31.362
Holy Jesus Christ, man!

01:20:31.363 --> 01:20:34.098
Dude, I am done!
Just let me out. I give up...

01:20:36.601 --> 01:20:36.934
What the fuck?
Get me out of here now!

01:20:39.571 --> 01:20:40.271
You look...

01:20:49.681 --> 01:20:50.881
Jesus Christ!

01:20:52.084 --> 01:20:55.353
Hey, hey! How the fuck
do I get out of here?

01:20:55.354 --> 01:20:56.721
What the fuck?

01:20:56.722 --> 01:20:58.656
- What the fuck!

01:20:58.657 --> 01:20:59.623
Oh, shit.

01:21:03.161 --> 01:21:05.262
Okay.

01:21:15.607 --> 01:21:17.208
No!

01:21:17.209 --> 01:21:19.877
Can any of you
guys hear me in here?

01:21:23.115 --> 01:21:23.447
All right, we're done!

01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:26.784
What the fuck?

01:21:30.222 --> 01:21:32.156
What the fuck, man!

01:21:32.157 --> 01:21:34.792
- Get me the fuck out of here!
- Bobby, where are you?

01:21:34.793 --> 01:21:37.762
Get me out of here!
Get me the fuck out of here!

01:21:37.763 --> 01:21:39.930
- Get me the fuck...

01:21:39.931 --> 01:21:42.833
Get me the fuck...
Bobby! Mikey!

01:21:42.834 --> 01:21:45.136
Somebody fucking answer me!

01:21:45.137 --> 01:21:46.871
What's going on?

01:21:46.872 --> 01:21:48.105
Fuck!

01:21:55.981 --> 01:21:58.716
Jesus.

01:21:58.717 --> 01:21:59.316
Hey, man, tell me you know
how to get out of
this fucking place.

01:22:02.454 --> 01:22:03.788
Hey.

01:22:03.789 --> 01:22:04.955
What the fuck is this?

01:22:07.292 --> 01:22:09.827
Your props are
really fucking scary!

01:22:09.828 --> 01:22:11.328
Oh! Shit.

01:22:11.329 --> 01:22:13.130
Hello?

01:22:14.566 --> 01:22:16.767
What the fuck is going on?

01:22:16.768 --> 01:22:18.002
Hello!

01:22:18.003 --> 01:22:18.602
Hello!

01:22:19.838 --> 01:22:21.071
--Oh, shit!

01:22:23.108 --> 01:22:24.809
Michael! Mike!

01:22:24.810 --> 01:22:25.910
Michael, I'm in here man!

01:22:27.813 --> 01:22:29.547
- Get me the fuck out!
- Mike!

01:22:29.548 --> 01:22:31.449
- God dammit!
What the fuck is wrong?
- Bobby?

01:22:31.450 --> 01:22:32.783
- Michael?
- Bobby!

01:22:32.784 --> 01:22:34.151
Michael!

01:22:34.152 --> 01:22:36.120
- Guys, can you hear me?
- No! Look at the door.

01:22:36.121 --> 01:22:37.488
Get the fuck out!

01:22:37.489 --> 01:22:39.323
Get the fuck
out of there now!

01:22:39.324 --> 01:22:40.658
- Find the door!

01:22:40.659 --> 01:22:42.860
Michael! Michael!

01:22:42.861 --> 01:22:43.260
Come on.
Come on, there's
gotta be a light in here.

01:22:46.465 --> 01:22:47.965
Come on.

01:22:53.071 --> 01:22:54.839
Coming through!
Pardon me!

01:22:56.274 --> 01:22:58.342
Stop it!

01:22:58.343 --> 01:23:00.044
Please stop!

01:23:03.915 --> 01:23:05.816
- Just get
me out of here!

01:23:05.817 --> 01:23:07.551
Please get me out of here!

01:23:09.621 --> 01:23:12.122
- I'm going to fuck your world!
- No...

01:23:15.694 --> 01:23:18.362
Brandy?

01:23:18.363 --> 01:23:20.931
Guys,
somebody please talk to me.

01:23:20.932 --> 01:23:23.501
Please God,
please God, please God.

01:23:27.672 --> 01:23:29.073
Zack?

01:23:29.074 --> 01:23:31.609
Zack, what the fuck
are you doing in here, man?

01:23:31.610 --> 01:23:33.477
We got to get out of here.

01:23:33.478 --> 01:23:35.913
This is not a fucking haunt.

01:23:37.182 --> 01:23:38.382
You having fun, Bobby?

01:25:40.071 --> 01:25:41.605
Help!

01:25:41.606 --> 01:25:42.406
Help!

01:25:43.642 --> 01:25:44.508
Please...

Bobby!

01:25:47.746 --> 01:25:50.381
Please help!

01:25:52.117 --> 01:25:53.784
Help me!

01:25:55.453 --> 01:25:56.920
Can anybody hear me!

01:26:07.532 --> 01:26:10.034
I can't breathe in here!

01:26:31.022 --> 01:26:31.522
Please!

01:26:32.624 --> 01:26:34.725
Please!

01:26:49.207 --> 01:26:51.375
Help!

01:26:55.046 --> 01:26:56.647
Help!

01:26:56.648 --> 01:26:57.381
Please help me!

01:26:59.317 --> 01:27:00.217
Please...

01:27:00.852 --> 01:27:03.420
Help!

01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:16.166
<i>What's the best
part about your job?</i>

01:27:17.068 --> 01:27:20.003
I'm... I'm not me
for five hours a day.

01:27:23.808 --> 01:27:27.811
And if I can get out
of the tangled up mess,

01:27:27.812 --> 01:27:30.547
that is my head
and into somebody else's head.

01:27:30.548 --> 01:27:33.584
All that pent-up aggression
is now taken out on somebody,

01:27:33.585 --> 01:27:35.652
and, you know,

01:27:35.653 --> 01:27:39.690
be as vicious and mean
as I can towards anybody
to scare 'em.

01:27:39.691 --> 01:27:43.794
You want to make it so that
they're not gonna escape.

01:27:43.795 --> 01:27:47.064
Right?
I mean, that's the thing,
we don't want them to escape.

01:27:47.065 --> 01:27:50.334
If I were a zombie
and they came out here,

01:27:50.335 --> 01:27:52.803
my goal is to eat their
brains and survive, right?

01:27:52.804 --> 01:27:55.606
And, um, their goal
is to not make it out,

01:27:55.607 --> 01:27:58.041
or try to make it out
if they can.

01:27:58.042 --> 01:28:00.210
Um.

01:28:00.211 --> 01:28:02.713
They're coming out here
and it's going to be
their last visit anywhere.
