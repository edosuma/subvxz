00:48.047 --> 00:49.758
(<i> slurps</i> ):
Ew!

00:49.841 --> 00:50.633
Not very lemony.

00:50.717 --> 00:51.760
Keep juicing.

00:51.843 --> 00:53.928
Maybe we should
just make instant.

00:54.012 --> 00:55.430
{\an8}I wouldn't dream of altering

00:55.513 --> 00:58.516
{\an7}our pre-county fair tradition
of making real lemonade...

00:58.600 --> 01:00.059
{\an8}to get us into the mood.

01:00.143 --> 01:01.478
{\an8}(<i> slurps</i> )

01:01.561 --> 01:04.730
{\an8}Because nothing
says country like
choking on a seed.

01:04.813 --> 01:06.816
{\an5}Hey, do you
guys realize
we've been going

01:06.900 --> 01:09.110
to the county fair
for eight years now?

01:09.194 --> 01:10.445
{\an8}At least.

01:10.528 --> 01:12.447
{\an8}Lost my first baby tooth
on a candy apple.

01:12.530 --> 01:15.325
So I've taken the liberty of
updating our list for tomorrow.

01:15.408 --> 01:17.494
{\an5}I mean, we're way
past kiddie rides
and petting zoos.

01:17.577 --> 01:19.496
I totally agree.

01:19.579 --> 01:20.997
{\an1}So I have
something new to...

01:21.080 --> 01:22.499
Oh, good.

01:22.582 --> 01:23.666
Now, I thought
we'd enjoy

01:23.750 --> 01:24.793
the Amish
quilt exhibits.

01:24.876 --> 01:28.213
Oh, and I wouldn't mind
trying my hand at spinning wool,

01:28.296 --> 01:29.506
if that doesn't offend

01:29.589 --> 01:30.882
{\an5}anyone's
feminist
sensibilities.

01:30.965 --> 01:31.800
{\an8}DODIE:
We can work
that in,

01:31.883 --> 01:34.677
{\an8}uh... between the
topiary demonstration

01:34.761 --> 01:35.595
{\an8}and the rabbit barn.

01:35.678 --> 01:38.515
{\an8}To another great,
unchanged, BFF tradition.

01:38.598 --> 01:39.933
{\an8}I invited Darren.

01:40.016 --> 01:41.351
{\an8}(<i> spits</i> )

01:41.434 --> 01:43.311
{\an8}Should have gone
with the instant.

01:43.394 --> 01:45.146
He <i> is</i> my boyfriend.

01:45.230 --> 01:48.441
But it's always just
been the three of us.

01:48.525 --> 01:50.944
{\an8}And it still will be...
plus Darren.

01:51.027 --> 01:52.362
{\an8}He really wants to go.

01:52.445 --> 01:53.780
Oh, sure.

01:53.863 --> 01:54.823
I never heard him say that.

01:54.906 --> 01:57.283
Correct me
if I'm mistaken,

01:57.367 --> 02:00.411
but didn't Darren use
to moo at us on fair day?

02:00.495 --> 02:03.206
Yeah, when he was, like, ten.

02:03.289 --> 02:04.666
You just want to be stuck

02:04.749 --> 02:07.043
on the Ferris wheel
with your boyfriend,

02:07.126 --> 02:11.005
{\an5}so you can make out
like they do in
every teen movie.

02:13.925 --> 02:15.343
That's not why.

02:15.426 --> 02:17.762
I want to share the day
with him.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.515
And you guys.

02:20.598 --> 02:21.891
It'll be just like always.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.309
And if anything,

02:23.393 --> 02:25.436
it'll be more fun
with Darren along.

02:28.231 --> 02:29.357
Fine... but I'm not making
a new list.

02:29.440 --> 02:33.403
Darren can just pet the angora
rabbits with the rest of us.

02:33.486 --> 02:34.571
(<i> Macie sneezes</i> )

02:34.654 --> 02:35.488
Sorry.

02:35.572 --> 02:36.698
Mere mention.

02:36.781 --> 02:40.285
{\an5}HOODSEY:
Did you know they're milking
a camel at the fair,

02:40.368 --> 02:42.745
and they're selling the milk,
like to drink?

02:42.829 --> 02:44.831
I refuse
to be party

02:44.914 --> 02:46.749
to more anti-cow propaganda.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.001
First the soybean,
then the goat

02:48.084 --> 02:51.004
and now a mean-
tempered dromedary?

02:51.087 --> 02:52.922
What if it spits
while it's being milked?

02:53.006 --> 02:56.259
Oh, we wouldn't want
to miss that.

02:56.342 --> 02:58.011
Sour Explosion layer?

02:58.094 --> 02:59.929
No lactating camels for us,
Hoods.

03:00.013 --> 03:03.182
We have bigger freaks to fry.

03:03.266 --> 03:06.519
{\an5}I heard from Dwayne,
who heard from his
carny worker cousin,

03:06.603 --> 03:08.646
that this year's fair
is showcasing

03:08.730 --> 03:10.273
an exhibit of nature's oddities.

03:10.356 --> 03:10.899
Wow!

03:10.982 --> 03:13.067
I wonder what it'd be like

03:13.151 --> 03:14.360
to have a carny worker
in the family.

03:14.444 --> 03:17.947
Beyond our wildest dreams,
but that's not the point.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.325
Dwayne's cousin, who
goes by one name--

03:20.408 --> 03:21.576
Raymo-- says that...

03:21.659 --> 03:22.327
Raymo.

03:22.410 --> 03:24.120
Even sounds
like a carny worker.

03:24.203 --> 03:27.790
Enviably so,
but again, not the point.

03:27.874 --> 03:28.875
One of nature's
oddities is

03:28.958 --> 03:32.045
a real, live,
two-headed horse.

03:32.128 --> 03:33.379
No way!

03:33.463 --> 03:37.467
With two noses and four eyes
and four ears and everything?

03:37.550 --> 03:39.302
Yep.

03:39.385 --> 03:40.386
(<i> cracks lollipop</i> )

03:40.470 --> 03:42.096
Cracked through
to the jalapeño.

03:42.180 --> 03:42.639
You finish.

03:42.722 --> 03:44.974
I'm too excited to eat.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.393
A two-headed horse.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.771
We got to see it, Carl!

03:49.854 --> 03:52.148
This violates the best
friend/boyfriend pact,

03:52.231 --> 03:53.691
and Ginger knows it.

03:53.775 --> 03:54.817
It clearly states
that the best friend

03:54.901 --> 03:57.320
must get prior
verbal approval

03:57.403 --> 03:59.530
before invading
a "girls only" event

03:59.614 --> 04:00.740
with said boyfriend,

04:00.823 --> 04:02.909
or it's an
all-out conflict.

04:02.992 --> 04:04.702
Um... could we not talk?

04:04.786 --> 04:07.664
Because when you get
all military-like,

04:07.747 --> 04:09.874
it's scary and confusing.

04:09.958 --> 04:12.043
Oh, how can I expect
you to understand?

04:12.126 --> 04:14.087
You don't even care
about the county fair.

04:14.170 --> 04:15.755
For your info-tainment,

04:15.838 --> 04:18.675
me and Carl are going
to the fair tomorrow.

04:18.757 --> 04:23.096
{\an1}What's the Gripling limo
doing in our neighborhood?

04:23.179 --> 04:24.847
Hi, Courtney.

04:24.931 --> 04:26.265
How's it going?

04:26.349 --> 04:27.558
Oh.

04:27.642 --> 04:28.768
Not too close,
Dodie.

04:28.851 --> 04:31.145
{\an5}I've come down
with a dreadful
case of boredom,

04:31.229 --> 04:32.480
and it might be
catching.

04:32.563 --> 04:33.690
Huh?

04:33.773 --> 04:36.567
Summer is almost over,
and I haven't had

04:36.651 --> 04:37.860
that offbeat
summer experience,

04:37.944 --> 04:40.822
which I will use
to enthrall

04:40.905 --> 04:42.281
{\an5}less-interesting
peers on school's
first day.

04:42.365 --> 04:45.910
{\an5}And don't suggest
I recycle one of
my old stories.

04:45.994 --> 04:48.997
That may have
worked last year,

04:49.080 --> 04:49.872
but not in high school.

04:49.956 --> 04:53.042
What's Ginger up to these days?

04:53.126 --> 04:57.171
{\an4}Oh, just violating
practically every BFF law
there ever was.

04:57.255 --> 04:58.506
Tension in the ranks?

04:58.589 --> 05:00.049
Oh.

05:00.133 --> 05:00.717
How un-boring.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.261
Courtney...

05:03.344 --> 05:07.015
I think I know just the offbeat
summer experience for you.

05:07.974 --> 05:08.808
Hmm...

05:08.891 --> 05:10.810
Last night's chow mein...

05:10.893 --> 05:11.686
rind of gouda.

05:11.769 --> 05:14.272
Oh, we have a winner!

05:14.355 --> 05:16.607
Week-old Tex-Mex casserole.

05:16.691 --> 05:18.651
Mrs. F, I can't help but admire

05:18.735 --> 05:21.029
your confidence
in your leftovers.

05:21.112 --> 05:21.654
Comes with age, Macie.

05:21.738 --> 05:22.905
You girls want eggs?

05:22.989 --> 05:25.408
Sounds good,
but we can't.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.410
We're saving our stomachs
for fair food.

05:27.493 --> 05:30.955
{\an1}Well, my stomach can handle
Lois' special eggs

05:31.039 --> 05:32.832
and a fried salami on a stick,
thank you very much.

05:32.915 --> 05:33.875
LOIS:
That reminds me...

05:33.958 --> 05:35.418
my Miracle Man Slicer-Dicer--

05:35.501 --> 05:39.130
it's on the fritz ever since
you ruined the last one,

05:39.213 --> 05:39.922
cutting up
old boots.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.675
Julie and old boots.

05:42.759 --> 05:44.302
Whatever.

05:44.385 --> 05:47.430
I need a replacement, and
they only sell them at the fair.

05:47.513 --> 05:48.639
Ginger, take $20

05:48.723 --> 05:51.100
and pick me up
a new one, would you?

05:51.184 --> 05:52.435
Hey, all!

05:52.518 --> 05:53.394
Or should
I just say moo?

05:55.146 --> 05:56.522
Hi, Darren.

05:56.606 --> 05:58.900
Want some of
my huevos especiale?

05:58.983 --> 06:01.194
Do I smell last week's
Tex-Mex casserole?

06:01.277 --> 06:01.778
Right on.

06:01.861 --> 06:04.739
{\an1}GINGER:
You can't.

06:04.822 --> 06:06.616
{\an1}It's our tradition
to head straight

06:06.699 --> 06:09.077
{\an1}for the giant deep-fried
sticky bun booth.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.161
(<i> chuckles</i> )

06:10.244 --> 06:11.454
{\an1}Darren...

06:11.537 --> 06:14.665
might I suggest that
you allow Hoodsey and myself

06:14.749 --> 06:17.001
to show you
the real county fair--

06:17.085 --> 06:19.796
the dark, seamy underbelly
that the girls never see

06:19.879 --> 06:22.465
{\an1}as they stroll through
bunny barns and the like?

06:22.548 --> 06:23.382
{\an4}We're going
to the <i> bunny</i> barns?

06:23.466 --> 06:26.803
I promise you'll have
the best day ever.

06:26.886 --> 06:30.640
Maybe we'll even get stuck
on top of the Ferris wheel,

06:30.723 --> 06:32.183
if you know what I mean.

06:32.266 --> 06:33.518
Not really.

06:33.601 --> 06:35.144
{\an4}LOIS:
I know
what you mean.

06:35.228 --> 06:38.481
Heck, that ploy was around when
Martha Washington was a girl.

06:38.564 --> 06:41.567
{\an1}And it does no good to bribe
the Ferris wheel operator,

06:41.651 --> 06:42.652
believe me.

06:42.735 --> 06:43.945
(<i> car horn beeps</i> )

06:44.570 --> 06:45.530
CHAUFFEUR:
Good day, all.

06:45.613 --> 06:49.408
I'm here to shuttle everyone
to the county fair.

06:51.202 --> 06:54.163
{\an1}Good morning,
simple country folk.

06:55.414 --> 06:56.499
Whoa.

06:56.582 --> 06:59.127
{\an1}It's Heidi meets
Ellie Mae meets a stylist.

06:59.210 --> 07:01.712
Courtney, what are
you doing here?

07:01.796 --> 07:04.048
Going to the fair with you,
of course.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.801
<i>Our</i> county fair?

07:06.884 --> 07:08.219
The very same, Macie.

07:08.302 --> 07:11.389
Why, I would never have even
known we lived in a county

07:11.472 --> 07:13.266
if it weren't for Dodie.

07:24.443 --> 07:26.696
It's everything I imagined--

07:26.779 --> 07:30.867
the sights, the smells,
the lack of fashion.

07:30.950 --> 07:31.576
So, uh, hey...

07:31.659 --> 07:32.994
let's hit the rides,
have some food

07:33.077 --> 07:34.662
and, uh... what,
split by 1:00?

07:34.745 --> 07:36.873
One?

07:36.956 --> 07:38.249
We always stay until night.

07:38.332 --> 07:39.542
{\an3}You do?

07:39.625 --> 07:40.626
I mean, we do?

07:40.710 --> 07:42.336
COURTNEY:
Oh, Darren...

07:42.420 --> 07:43.129
haven't you seen
Dodie's list?

07:43.212 --> 07:46.883
So much to do,
so little time.

07:46.966 --> 07:48.634
Mmm... my thoughts exactly.

07:48.718 --> 07:50.052
Come on, Hoods.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.846
Meet back here at 8:00.

07:51.929 --> 07:52.722
{\an1}No prob.

07:52.805 --> 07:54.098
Say, sis...

07:54.182 --> 07:56.100
how about letting me
relieve your burden

07:56.184 --> 07:58.936
of purchasing the momster
a new slicer-dicer?

08:00.646 --> 08:01.898
{\an3}Hold on.

08:01.981 --> 08:03.900
You're going to
conveniently forget

08:03.983 --> 08:05.276
and use the money
for junk.

08:05.359 --> 08:07.528
{\an1}Uh... how right you are
not to trust me.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.947
I was going to use it
for multiple viewings

08:10.031 --> 08:11.282
of the two-headed horse.

08:11.365 --> 08:13.910
You are seriously disturbed.

08:13.993 --> 08:14.994
{\an1}Well, then,
I'm in the right place.

08:15.077 --> 08:17.496
(<i> both cackle</i> )

08:27.048 --> 08:27.924
You were right.

08:28.007 --> 08:29.884
These things are great.

08:29.967 --> 08:32.053
{\an1}I know.

08:32.135 --> 08:35.640
That's why I wanted to be
here for your first bite.

08:37.015 --> 08:38.893
Do you people know
what you're doing?

08:38.976 --> 08:41.770
{\an1}Why, nursing seals have
less fat than these buns.

08:41.854 --> 08:44.273
Yes, but the giant
deep-fried pickle

08:44.357 --> 08:47.109
burns serious calories
just with the chewing,

08:47.193 --> 08:48.653
so it balances out.

08:48.736 --> 08:52.031
{\an1}Courtney, we don't want to
think about fat grams today.

08:52.114 --> 08:54.700
{\an1}We come here to feel young
and uncomplicated.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.118
Really?

08:56.202 --> 08:58.454
Oh, I've always wanted
to feel that way.

08:58.538 --> 08:59.789
Maybe later we can go

08:59.872 --> 09:01.791
{\an1}on one of those
nauseating rides,

09:01.874 --> 09:03.960
and I'll toss my cookies
in a metal rubbish bin.

09:04.043 --> 09:06.170
Cool with me.

09:06.254 --> 09:08.005
Ew... Darren.

09:08.631 --> 09:11.300
{\an1}COURTNEY:
Are you telling me

09:11.384 --> 09:14.637
these fuzzy, cuddly creatures
are real, live sheep?

09:14.720 --> 09:16.847
MACIE:
Best in the county.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.724
They're getting ready
for the show ring.

09:18.808 --> 09:23.062
Competition, stylish outfits,
attentive servants.

09:23.145 --> 09:24.730
Sheep are so me.

09:24.814 --> 09:26.691
{\an1}Come on, we'll show you
our favorite.

09:29.277 --> 09:30.945
Good luck, Mamie.

09:31.028 --> 09:32.488
She won't be
showing this year.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.323
Mamie's just given birth.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.658
There's
her lamb.

09:35.741 --> 09:37.076
(<i> bleats feebly</i> )

09:37.159 --> 09:39.328
It's refusing to nurse.

09:39.412 --> 09:44.166
Once it rejects its mother,
we have to take it away.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.835
Wrench a newborn babe

09:45.918 --> 09:48.337
{\an1}from this prize-winning,
snowy-white sow,

09:48.421 --> 09:50.006
{\an1}just because it's not thirsty
at the moment?

09:50.089 --> 09:53.092
Barbaric!

09:53.175 --> 09:55.177
Ginger, hurry up.

09:55.261 --> 09:57.471
Dodie Bishop can't hurry me...

09:57.555 --> 09:59.307
not on fair day...

09:59.390 --> 10:00.057
not in the sheep barn.

10:00.141 --> 10:02.935
Yeah, about that--

10:03.019 --> 10:04.854
did you notice
it smells in here?

10:04.937 --> 10:05.730
No, it doesn't.

10:05.813 --> 10:08.357
Besides, it's part
of being around animals.

10:08.441 --> 10:11.527
So what's say we go
be around some rides?

10:11.610 --> 10:15.114
{\an4}I hear the Screaming Squid
hangs you upside down for
a whole 30 seconds.

10:15.197 --> 10:17.366
That's for later.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.744
{\an1}Can't you just enjoy
the sheep barn?

10:19.827 --> 10:21.579
{\an1}I don't have
to do that, do I?

10:21.662 --> 10:23.039
Because these are new Kicks.

10:23.122 --> 10:25.166
None of this silliness.

10:25.249 --> 10:26.751
{\an1}You can reject
your mother later

10:26.834 --> 10:27.418
when you're a teenage lamb.

10:27.501 --> 10:30.463
{\an5}MACIE:
The lamb is
drinking.

10:30.546 --> 10:32.048
Farmer Don!

10:32.131 --> 10:33.883
I can't believe it.

10:33.966 --> 10:37.136
{\an1}You've got a way
with animals, young lady.

10:37.219 --> 10:40.056
Our very own sheep whisperer.

10:40.139 --> 10:43.059
{\an5}Now, I noticed
some icky stuff
on the lamb's head,

10:43.142 --> 10:44.602
so you might want
to give her

10:44.685 --> 10:45.478
a quick shampoo
and blow-dry.

10:45.561 --> 10:48.898
{\an1}Oh, the mama sheep
will take care of that.

10:48.981 --> 10:51.233
It's just the afterbirth.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.444
I'll meet you outside.

10:53.527 --> 10:54.236
Darren!

10:54.320 --> 10:57.198
{\an1}Something wrong
with Darren?

10:57.281 --> 10:58.157
Too much
sharing the day.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.368
(<i> hums smugly</i> )

11:00.451 --> 11:08.501
(<i> carnival music playing</i> )

11:10.461 --> 11:12.129
That's got to be Raymo.

11:13.589 --> 11:14.757
Name's Carl.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.259
Your cousin Dwayne
told me to look you up.

11:17.343 --> 11:18.803
Said you knew your way
around this place.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.643
Don't remember having
a cousin Dwayne.

11:25.726 --> 11:27.603
Yeah, well, Dwayne
said you wouldn't.

11:27.686 --> 11:29.730
My friend and I are
on a scientific quest.

11:29.814 --> 11:31.524
Perhaps you
could, uh...

11:31.607 --> 11:35.319
Go behind the Tilt 'n' Spin
and veer right by the Funhouse.

11:35.403 --> 11:37.196
Second tent down.

11:37.279 --> 11:39.115
Got the pony you're looking for.

11:39.198 --> 11:40.658
Let's go, Carl.

11:40.741 --> 11:41.575
Thank you.

11:41.659 --> 11:43.786
Oh, I'd also like to thank you

11:43.869 --> 11:45.496
for remaining
a true American icon,

11:45.579 --> 11:46.872
the last of
a dying breed,

11:46.956 --> 11:49.875
like the cowboy
and the big band leader.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.710
Nice of someone to notice.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.967
{\an1}Don't tell
your friends.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.385
Hush tickets.

11:59.468 --> 12:00.219
How deliciously corrupt.

12:00.302 --> 12:03.514
You don't disappoint, Raymo.

12:06.767 --> 12:08.144
Ooh, lookee, look.

12:08.227 --> 12:08.894
A woman working out

12:08.978 --> 12:11.689
{\an1}on pioneer-era
exercise equipment.

12:13.315 --> 12:14.150
Excuse me.

12:14.233 --> 12:17.069
{\an5}What's that
medieval-looking
contraption?

12:17.153 --> 12:17.486
It's a loom.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.780
I'm making cloth.

12:19.864 --> 12:20.656
Have a seat.

12:20.739 --> 12:22.450
I'll give you
a weaving lesson.

12:22.533 --> 12:23.325
Mama always said

12:23.409 --> 12:24.535
{\an1}not to bother
to learn a trade,

12:24.618 --> 12:27.413
{\an1}but I guess one time
won't hurt.

12:27.496 --> 12:29.748
Why is Courtney
stopping here?

12:29.832 --> 12:30.750
Isn't she great?

12:30.833 --> 12:32.001
She'll try anything.

12:32.084 --> 12:35.504
{\an5}And we've got
this nifty art
to prove it.

12:35.588 --> 12:38.924
{\an5}Ginger, it's one thing
to drag me through
the pie pavilion,

12:39.008 --> 12:40.009
but this craft thing?

12:40.092 --> 12:41.260
It's pushing it.

12:41.343 --> 12:42.845
Just a few more
minutes, Darren.

12:42.928 --> 12:43.846
{\an1}I promise.

12:43.929 --> 12:46.098
Why don't we just
go off by ourselves?

12:47.141 --> 12:48.267
{\an1}I-I can't.

12:48.350 --> 12:50.603
Wait here a sec, okay?

12:50.686 --> 12:53.772
Fine-- I'll go look
at that furniture.

12:53.856 --> 12:56.484
Got to be more interesting
than a huckleberry pie.

12:56.567 --> 12:57.526
(<i> sighs</i> )

12:57.610 --> 13:01.030
Emergency meeting,
outside.

13:05.409 --> 13:06.452
Dodie.

13:06.535 --> 13:08.412
Courtney is ruining
our fair day.

13:08.496 --> 13:09.538
What do you mean?

13:09.622 --> 13:11.415
{\an1}We're doing everything
on the list.

13:11.499 --> 13:13.667
Well, she's slowing us down.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.711
{\an1}She has to
try everything,

13:15.794 --> 13:17.129
make comments, gush.

13:17.213 --> 13:19.548
You never should have invited
her without consulting us.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.675
Oh, and I suppose
you consulted us

13:21.759 --> 13:25.471
{\an1}when you invited lover man
on the Ferris wheel?

13:25.554 --> 13:27.556
{\an5}The boy
formerly known
as Darren.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.642
{\an4}Well,
that's different,
and you know it.

13:29.725 --> 13:31.185
{\an4}Darren's
my boyfriend,
and Courtney's...

13:31.268 --> 13:33.187
Well, Courtney.

13:33.270 --> 13:34.647
She doesn't belong here.

13:34.730 --> 13:35.731
{\an1}Tell that to
a grateful Farmer Don.

13:35.814 --> 13:39.485
{\an5}Um, not to mention
the hippie chick
with the loom.

13:39.568 --> 13:42.821
Look-- Courtney's my friend,
but that doesn't mean

13:42.905 --> 13:45.407
{\an1}I want to share our
BFF traditions with her.

13:45.491 --> 13:48.327
That's for the three
of us... plus Darren.

13:48.410 --> 13:49.203
Plus Courtney.

13:49.286 --> 13:49.787
Ginger,

13:49.870 --> 13:51.622
I've waited
long enough.

13:51.705 --> 13:53.707
I'm going to ride
the Screaming Squid

13:53.791 --> 13:54.917
and get some pizza.

13:55.000 --> 13:55.709
No... you can't.

13:55.793 --> 13:56.794
Excuse me?

13:56.877 --> 13:57.711
What I meant was...

13:57.795 --> 13:59.296
{\an5}She meant,
we don't do rides

13:59.380 --> 14:01.382
until it gets dark,
and pizza is out,

14:01.465 --> 14:03.759
because we eat giant
deep-fried pickles next.

14:03.842 --> 14:05.928
{\an1}Let me explain
something.

14:06.011 --> 14:06.929
(<i> anvil rings</i> )

14:07.012 --> 14:07.721
I don't care.

14:07.805 --> 14:09.431
{\an1}I'm tired
of being dragged

14:09.515 --> 14:11.767
{\an1}all over this place
doing your thing.

14:11.850 --> 14:14.144
I came here to have fun...

14:14.228 --> 14:15.854
with my girlfriend.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.439
Catch you later.

14:17.856 --> 14:19.650
Darren, wait.

14:20.025 --> 14:22.111
Here we are.

14:22.194 --> 14:23.195
Where'd Darren go?

14:23.279 --> 14:23.737
To the midway.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.614
{\an1}I'm going
after him.

14:25.698 --> 14:28.242
{\an1}Tradition's all
messed up anyway.

14:28.617 --> 14:30.703
It sure is.

14:34.456 --> 14:36.625
{\an1}Stay behind the ropes
at all times.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.252
{\an1}No feeding
the animals.

14:38.335 --> 14:42.548
{\an4}CARL:
World's largest mouse,
world's smallest dog,

14:42.631 --> 14:44.508
live, two-headed horse.

14:44.592 --> 14:45.759
Gosh, Carl.

14:45.843 --> 14:48.053
That horse looks
kind of small

14:48.137 --> 14:49.430
in that picture.

14:49.513 --> 14:52.391
That's because it's
a miniature horse, you ingrate.

14:52.474 --> 14:54.393
And finish that caramel apple
outside the tent.

14:54.476 --> 14:55.978
It keeps
getting better.

14:56.061 --> 15:00.816
{\an5}The horse is already
a freak of nature
by being miniature,

15:00.899 --> 15:02.359
and it's got two heads.

15:02.443 --> 15:05.154
{\an5}Being small is nothing
to be ashamed of.

15:05.237 --> 15:07.156
{\an1}I think they're
a special breed, Carl.

15:07.239 --> 15:09.241
I'm just saying,
this horse may be

15:09.325 --> 15:11.535
the singularly most
twisted thing I've ever seen.

15:11.619 --> 15:14.330
And dude, I have seen a lot.

15:14.413 --> 15:16.165
No flash
photography.

15:16.248 --> 15:18.542
Go on in.

15:21.795 --> 15:23.756
(<i> people oohing and ahhing</i> )

15:23.839 --> 15:27.468
{\an5}MAN (<i> in background</i> ):
Well, that's something
you don't see every day.

15:27.551 --> 15:29.261
(<i> oohing and ahhing</i> )

15:33.932 --> 15:35.643
{\an1}A capybara
from South America.

15:35.726 --> 15:38.312
{\an1}I mean, it's a member
of the rodentia family,

15:38.395 --> 15:39.772
but they can't pawn it off

15:39.855 --> 15:41.440
as a common field mouse.

15:41.523 --> 15:42.191
{\an3}Yeah.

15:42.274 --> 15:45.361
Who do they think
they're fooling?

15:49.782 --> 15:50.574
Big deal.

15:50.658 --> 15:51.575
You see those
on TV commercials.

15:51.659 --> 15:53.619
We want the real thing.

15:53.702 --> 15:56.121
WOMAN:
Get out of there.

15:56.205 --> 15:57.039
Out of my way.

15:57.122 --> 15:58.123
{\an1}HOODSEY:
Step back.

15:58.207 --> 15:59.333
CARL:
Coming through.

15:59.416 --> 16:00.709
Look at those people.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.337
They're displaying
the worst of humanity.

16:03.420 --> 16:05.631
Hey, back off,
you horse harassers!

16:05.714 --> 16:07.341
Let's get out of here, Carl.

16:07.424 --> 16:10.302
Maybe some things are best
left to the imagination.

16:10.386 --> 16:11.720
No, Hoods.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.681
Maybe I was once like
this unfeeling mob--

16:13.764 --> 16:17.017
interested only
in the exploitation

16:17.101 --> 16:19.937
of a tiny, two-headed
beast of burden.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.063
But now,

16:21.146 --> 16:24.274
{\an1}now I'm interested
in something else entirely.

16:27.361 --> 16:27.695
You mean...?

16:27.778 --> 16:29.488
That's right.

16:29.571 --> 16:29.988
Liberation!

16:32.449 --> 16:33.242
(<i> horse whinnies</i> )

16:33.325 --> 16:34.493
Yee-ha!

16:34.576 --> 16:37.162
Carl, you don't even
know how to ride.

16:49.341 --> 16:51.301
Hello, ladies.

16:51.385 --> 16:53.262
Run, boy.

16:53.345 --> 16:54.930
I mean,<i> boys.</i>

16:55.013 --> 16:56.890
Run like the wind!

16:56.974 --> 17:01.437
{\an5}Ginger, do you
care that your
only sibling

17:01.520 --> 17:04.064
{\an5}is on what appears
to be a two-headed,
runaway pony?

17:04.147 --> 17:05.607
{\an1}Of course she doesn't,
Macie.

17:05.691 --> 17:06.733
{\an1}She's having
a boyfriend crisis.

17:06.817 --> 17:08.652
Ginger, what was
the fight about?

17:08.736 --> 17:11.320
{\an1}I-It wasn't
really a fight.

17:11.405 --> 17:12.364
I guess Darren
just got bored.

17:12.448 --> 17:15.075
Bored? Here?

17:15.159 --> 17:16.076
I don't understand.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.703
He never really
wanted to come.

17:17.786 --> 17:18.787
I talked him into it.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.414
I just thought
Darren and I...

17:20.497 --> 17:20.955
Picture T-shirts.

17:21.039 --> 17:23.040
Oh, we have to do this!

17:23.125 --> 17:26.211
{\an5}...would have
the best day ever.

17:26.295 --> 17:28.589
{\an1}COURTNEY:
Ginger!

17:28.672 --> 17:30.132
Guys, I don't
really feel

17:30.215 --> 17:31.800
like having my
picture taken.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.302
And we need
to find Darren

17:33.385 --> 17:35.304
so someone will stop
being mad at me.

17:35.387 --> 17:37.306
{\an1}You don't want
to go there, Dodie.

17:37.389 --> 17:37.931
Fine-- take
Ginger's side.

17:38.015 --> 17:40.017
{\an1}COURTNEY:
I should say not.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.894
{\an1}It's about creating
lasting memories.

17:41.977 --> 17:44.104
Never pass up
an opportunity

17:44.188 --> 17:45.063
to have your
image preserved,

17:45.147 --> 17:46.356
even if it is blurry

17:46.440 --> 17:48.275
and will probably
fade with washing.

17:50.152 --> 17:52.279
Now, remember--
teeth, not gums.

17:57.659 --> 18:00.662
Not how I want
to remember our day.

18:00.746 --> 18:02.122
Again, please.

18:07.377 --> 18:09.171
Come on.

18:09.254 --> 18:10.172
Drink up, boys.

18:10.255 --> 18:11.715
Long journey ahead.

18:13.258 --> 18:14.927
(<i> gasps</i> )

18:15.010 --> 18:15.886
No!

18:15.969 --> 18:17.679
I ran you too hard!

18:17.763 --> 18:20.682
Your liberation
was your downfall.

18:20.766 --> 18:22.184
HOODSEY:
Oh, Carl.

18:22.267 --> 18:24.269
Carl, you should
have seen it.

18:24.353 --> 18:26.688
That mean carny dude
was screaming,

18:26.772 --> 18:29.399
and people were all,
"I want my money back!"

18:29.483 --> 18:32.319
And someone let loose
the giant mouse and...

18:32.402 --> 18:33.654
Agh!

18:33.737 --> 18:35.197
I'm scarred!

18:35.280 --> 18:36.573
Scarred for life!

18:36.657 --> 18:39.284
I should have left
well enough alone.

18:39.368 --> 18:41.870
Sure these two fine heads
were ridiculed

18:41.954 --> 18:44.206
by fellow horses
and people alike,

18:44.289 --> 18:46.375
but at least
they were together.

18:46.458 --> 18:47.251
(<i> sniffling</i> )

18:47.334 --> 18:49.920
Uh...

18:50.003 --> 18:51.213
Carl.

18:51.296 --> 18:52.381
That smells funny...

18:52.464 --> 18:55.717
like when I used to wash
my toys in the toilet.

18:55.801 --> 18:56.927
{\an1}Hey.

18:57.010 --> 18:58.846
It's a stuffed animal.

18:58.929 --> 19:00.347
{\an1}Look at those glass eyes,
that synthetic mane.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.936
So you were in
on this scheme, too?

19:06.019 --> 19:07.187
Boy, were
we suckered!

19:07.271 --> 19:12.317
{\an5}Guess there's no
one true thing
at this place.

19:12.401 --> 19:13.318
Maybe.

19:13.402 --> 19:14.444
{\an1}Maybe not.

19:14.528 --> 19:15.404
{\an1}How'd you
find me, anyway?

19:15.487 --> 19:17.364
Duh.

19:17.447 --> 19:19.616
I knew you'd go
for the bunny barn.

19:19.700 --> 19:23.161
{\an5}Hoods, it's like
sometimes you're
my second head.

19:23.245 --> 19:24.788
I know what you mean, brother.

19:24.872 --> 19:27.332
(<i> goofy laughter</i> )

19:28.792 --> 19:29.751
(<i> bell rings</i> )

19:29.835 --> 19:31.169
Ooh, I did it,
I did it!

19:31.253 --> 19:34.631
{\an5}And it only
took 50 tries
at a dollar each.

19:34.715 --> 19:37.259
I love this game.

19:37.342 --> 19:39.094
{\an1}We've looked everywhere
for Darren.

19:39.177 --> 19:41.096
{\an4}COURTNEY:
Stack them up
again, boys.

19:41.179 --> 19:42.556
I still can't believe it.

19:42.639 --> 19:45.934
{\an4}I never expected
Courtney Gripling
to be so into the fair

19:46.018 --> 19:48.145
and Darren to be
so <i> not</i> into it.

19:48.228 --> 19:49.146
I would've guessed

19:49.229 --> 19:50.689
she'd make fun
of everything

19:50.772 --> 19:52.065
and make us miserable.

19:52.149 --> 19:53.483
I'm so sorry,
Ginger.

19:53.567 --> 19:55.277
{\an1}I invited her to get back
at you for inviting Darren.

19:55.360 --> 19:58.989
{\an5}I guess I was just
afraid that you'd
have a better time

19:59.072 --> 19:59.907
at the fair
with your boyfriend

19:59.990 --> 20:02.075
than you ever did with us.

20:02.159 --> 20:04.703
{\an1}Maybe I wanted
that, Dodie.

20:04.786 --> 20:05.746
{\an1}A little.

20:05.829 --> 20:06.914
I'm sorry, too.

20:06.997 --> 20:09.499
Candy apples, anyone?

20:09.583 --> 20:12.461
I think my permanent teeth
are all in.

20:17.049 --> 20:19.134
(<i> laughing</i> )

20:19.217 --> 20:21.303
{\an1}How do you get out
of this thing?

20:21.386 --> 20:22.304
Help!

20:22.387 --> 20:23.347
Macie!

20:24.389 --> 20:25.307
Must get out.

20:25.390 --> 20:26.308
Must get out.

20:26.391 --> 20:27.476
Oh...

20:28.060 --> 20:30.354
You're on your own, girls.

20:34.900 --> 20:39.279
I'm completely unattractive
and disproportionate...

20:39.363 --> 20:41.448
yet I can't look away.

20:44.284 --> 20:46.036
(<i> laughing</i> )

20:46.119 --> 20:48.956
Look at
your hair!

20:56.463 --> 20:58.340
GINGER:
Courtney, you've been great.

20:58.423 --> 21:00.384
I can't wait to do
this next year.

21:00.467 --> 21:01.385
Next year?

21:01.468 --> 21:03.011
You plan on coming back?

21:03.095 --> 21:04.346
OTHERS:
Yes.

21:04.429 --> 21:05.430
Girls...

21:05.514 --> 21:06.431
Once is an experience.

21:06.515 --> 21:10.894
More than that is, well...
borderline pathetic.

21:12.604 --> 21:15.649
I mean, this is fodder
for the cappuccino card,

21:15.732 --> 21:17.693
but it's a bit coarse
for a Gripling.

21:17.776 --> 21:19.736
Here we go.

21:19.820 --> 21:21.822
(<i> laughing</i> )

21:21.905 --> 21:24.157
I'd like to get off now.

21:24.241 --> 21:25.492
You!

21:25.575 --> 21:26.326
Worker man with ponytail.

21:26.410 --> 21:28.745
I insist you stop
this thing at once.

21:28.829 --> 21:31.081
GINGER:
It's no use.

21:31.164 --> 21:31.790
Just enjoy
the ride.

21:31.873 --> 21:36.044
I think I-I'm going to be...

21:36.128 --> 21:37.879
(<i> girls screaming</i> )

21:37.963 --> 21:40.215
(<i> screaming and yelling</i> )

21:41.717 --> 21:44.219
MACIE:
Oh, for the love of Mary!

21:44.302 --> 21:46.388

21:51.810 --> 21:54.062
{\an3}GINGER:
Darren!

21:54.146 --> 21:54.479
Darren!

21:55.647 --> 21:58.358
Hey, Ginger.

21:58.442 --> 21:59.735
Be right down.

21:59.818 --> 22:01.737
Buy me a slice?

22:05.449 --> 22:08.952
{\an5}GINGER:
<i>Even though we all enjoyed the</i>
<i>tractor pull, I'm pretty sure</i>

22:09.036 --> 22:11.913
<i>Darren and Courtney were glad</i>
<i>the day was almost over.</i>

22:11.997 --> 22:13.457
<i>And to be honest, so was I.</i>

22:13.540 --> 22:18.587
<i>It's exhausting trying to mix</i>
<i>old traditions with new,</i>

22:18.670 --> 22:20.422
<i>old friends with new.</i>

22:20.505 --> 22:24.384
<i>But when Darren gave me</i>
<i>the Miracle Man Slicer-Dicer,</i>

22:24.468 --> 22:27.179
<i>which I totally forgot</i>
<i>to buy for Mom,</i>

22:27.262 --> 22:30.932
<i>I realized that while it wasn't</i>
<i>the best day ever, Darren was.</i>

22:31.016 --> 22:32.684
<i>And that's what counts.</i>

22:32.768 --> 22:34.144
Hey, check it out.

22:34.227 --> 22:38.065
{\an5}It makes perfect
French fries,
julienne.
