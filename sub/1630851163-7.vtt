WEBVTT

00:07.466 --> 00:11.803
Talk of peace is in the past now.

00:14.473 --> 00:17.434
After the delegation's failure
at the peace summit,

00:17.518 --> 00:20.479
we're left with only one path forward.

00:21.605 --> 00:22.606
War.

00:24.650 --> 00:26.944
Remember this moment.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.988
Your names will be burned
into Payan history

00:30.072 --> 00:33.367
as the women and men
who stood with their queen

00:33.450 --> 00:37.287
to lead Paya into a new and blessed age.

00:37.371 --> 00:40.207
She's lying. Someone needs to stop her.

00:41.542 --> 00:42.543
Not now.

00:42.626 --> 00:45.546
Lord Harlan,
have all the representatives signed?

00:48.924 --> 00:49.925
Yes.

00:50.592 --> 00:53.554
The knots of all the representatives
have been added.

00:54.471 --> 00:57.558
Then, my ladies and lords,

00:57.641 --> 00:59.685
we're now at war.

01:00.185 --> 01:02.312
Have your captains report
to my Witchfinder general

01:02.396 --> 01:03.522
for assignments immediately.

01:03.605 --> 01:06.733
There is still another matter
to be brought before this council.

01:08.110 --> 01:12.281
Princess Maghra, there is always something
with you, isn't there? What is it now?

01:12.364 --> 01:13.824
It's about the Witchfinders.

01:15.117 --> 01:16.285
What about them?

01:17.327 --> 01:19.246
They will not fight for you.

01:21.748 --> 01:25.794
My Witchfinders will do as I say,
as they have done my entire reign.

01:25.878 --> 01:27.838
They're my army.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.047
No.

01:38.599 --> 01:41.059
They are my army.

01:42.644 --> 01:43.854
Tamacti Jun?

01:44.438 --> 01:46.940
I'm glad you haven't forgotten me.

01:47.024 --> 01:50.319
You're alive! Thank the God Flame.

01:50.402 --> 01:52.446
You have no idea what I went through.

01:53.322 --> 01:57.826
If you're gonna trade in lies, make sure
the truth is buried with the dead.

01:57.910 --> 02:02.456
-Lies?
-It was you who destroyed Kanzua.

02:04.875 --> 02:06.001
He is lying!

02:07.085 --> 02:08.377
Arrest this man.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.132
I said arrest this man!

02:12.216 --> 02:15.177
They don't serve you anymore.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.555
-Tak!
-Tak! Tak!

02:18.639 --> 02:20.432
Tak! Tak! Tak! Tak!

02:20.516 --> 02:24.811
Tak! Tak! Tak! Tak!

02:24.895 --> 02:29.483
It was you who murdered your own people…

02:31.109 --> 02:33.403
who killed their families.

02:35.614 --> 02:37.824
My family.

02:43.288 --> 02:48.877
It was you who tried to murder me.

02:51.588 --> 02:54.091
These are serious allegations, General.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.802
They're not allegations. They're truths.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.013
Like you, Captain Gosset,

03:00.848 --> 03:03.559
I have been loyal to the crown
my entire life.

03:04.434 --> 03:05.644
But this queen…

03:07.020 --> 03:08.188
this woman…

03:09.439 --> 03:11.984
this thing

03:12.067 --> 03:13.527
is an abomination.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.195
He keeps on lying!

03:15.279 --> 03:17.739
Maghra, tell them he's lying.

03:18.615 --> 03:20.033
He speaks the truth.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.495
You've betrayed your people
for the last time.

03:24.872 --> 03:27.708
This council has a decision to make.

03:28.792 --> 03:31.211
War is now inevitable.

03:32.713 --> 03:36.633
But will we be led by this lying murderer…

03:37.759 --> 03:43.473
or will we fight for the true queen…

03:44.474 --> 03:45.893
Maghra?

03:49.021 --> 03:51.607
So it's a coup?

03:52.149 --> 03:53.567
I understand.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.528
At our nation's gravest hour,

03:56.612 --> 04:01.158
my sister resorts to trickery
and lies to steal the throne.

04:01.241 --> 04:07.247
But she forgets that my army
is much larger than a few Witchfinders.

04:08.081 --> 04:11.376
Captain Gosset, arrest these traitors.

04:12.377 --> 04:13.587
Yeah…

04:15.088 --> 04:16.089
No.

04:18.007 --> 04:21.803
The army of Pennsa stands
with Queen Maghra.

04:21.887 --> 04:24.765
She's not your fucking queen!

04:24.848 --> 04:27.017
Let's agree to disagree, shall we?

04:28.185 --> 04:31.563
I can confirm the allegations
made by Tamacti Jun are true.

04:31.647 --> 04:34.149
I have witnesses from Kanzua
who will tell you

04:34.233 --> 04:37.277
the destruction of the city was her doing.

04:39.196 --> 04:40.739
And queen or no,

04:40.822 --> 04:43.992
treason and murder
are punishable by death.

04:44.076 --> 04:48.080
Wait, wait, wait. I'm entitled to a trial.

04:48.664 --> 04:53.293
You yourself just declared the war
you so desperately wanted.

04:54.878 --> 04:59.466
And by knotting the war declaration,

05:00.551 --> 05:04.346
you transferred authority from the courts…

05:06.306 --> 05:07.558
to the generals.

05:11.270 --> 05:12.771
You thought this through.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.732
I've had some time.

05:18.861 --> 05:21.113
Thank you for your service.

05:23.365 --> 05:24.491
Wait!

05:25.409 --> 05:27.035
She is with child.

05:30.789 --> 05:35.335
Sibeth lost her child
shortly after we arrived in Pennsa.

05:35.961 --> 05:37.337
This is a new one.

05:38.297 --> 05:39.756
Still forming.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.218
I feel him strongly.

05:44.094 --> 05:47.890
This child must not be killed
for the sins of the mother.

05:49.975 --> 05:52.019
Her death can wait. Toad.

05:52.102 --> 05:54.563
That's twice now you failed to kill me,
Tamacti Jun.

05:54.646 --> 05:57.065
-Get her out of here.
-The prophecy remains!

05:57.149 --> 05:59.610
And the God Flame is still with me.

05:59.693 --> 06:02.863
The child has arrived just in time
to save his mother.

06:03.447 --> 06:06.408
People, be true to the crown!

06:06.491 --> 06:09.620
Do not rest until your queen is back
on the throne.

06:09.703 --> 06:12.164
And the rest of you traitors,
you will be flayed alive.

06:12.247 --> 06:14.374
Put her in her chambers under guard.

06:15.459 --> 06:17.586
Keeping her in the palace is unwise.

06:17.669 --> 06:20.422
It is the most fortified building
in all of Pennsa.

06:23.175 --> 06:24.176
Quiet.

06:27.095 --> 06:28.305
Do you hear that?

06:34.269 --> 06:35.812
Woodvale has fallen.

06:43.654 --> 06:47.366
We took Woodvale
with zero Trivantian casualties.

06:48.617 --> 06:51.787
Thanks to your vision, we arrived
days before they were expecting us.

06:51.870 --> 06:54.623
Still managed
to get the signal out though.

06:54.706 --> 06:56.834
Pennsa knows we're on our way.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.670
That won't make them any more ready
for the full might of this battalion.

07:01.171 --> 07:03.382
And once the council
hears of our fast victory…

07:04.550 --> 07:06.635
they will finally ratify my strategy.

07:07.719 --> 07:10.389
You mean using sighted soldiers?

07:15.352 --> 07:20.274
General, please,
the council cannot know about me.

07:21.733 --> 07:23.861
I won't identify you until it's safe.

07:24.778 --> 07:28.073
Wren, you're like a daughter to me.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.368
I will protect you. You have my word.

09:01.500 --> 09:04.086
The Trivantians have reached Woodvale
faster than expected.

09:04.169 --> 09:08.423
At this rate, they'll be in Pennsa
in five or six days.

09:08.507 --> 09:11.218
How could their army be moving this fast?

09:11.301 --> 09:13.637
They have sighted soldiers
guiding their armies.

09:13.720 --> 09:16.807
The Trivantians wouldn't condone sight
in any form.

09:16.890 --> 09:20.352
The commander general has been
secretly recruiting and training them.

09:20.435 --> 09:23.063
If the Trivantians reach Pennsa,
we're finished.

09:23.146 --> 09:28.360
Agreed. Greenhill Gap.
Is the fortress still active?

09:28.443 --> 09:30.362
Of course. Fully fortified, 20 men.

09:30.445 --> 09:31.780
We'll make our stand there.

09:31.864 --> 09:35.284
No. Greenhill Gap's a stone's throw
from Pennsa. It's too close.

09:35.367 --> 09:37.911
It's the only place
that we can command the high ground.

09:37.995 --> 09:38.996
Gives us a chance.

09:39.663 --> 09:41.790
Any word on their numbers?

09:41.874 --> 09:43.959
They're heavily committed in the west.

09:44.042 --> 09:47.713
Our spies estimate 250 men.
A small force by Trivantian standards.

09:47.796 --> 09:49.506
Bigger than ours.

09:50.257 --> 09:53.093
I want every available soldier
and munition in Paya

09:53.177 --> 09:55.762
at Greenhill Gap in two days' time.

09:56.430 --> 09:57.973
Captain Gosset, ready your soldiers.

09:58.056 --> 10:00.225
We march tomorrow
with the rise of the God Flame.

10:00.309 --> 10:02.352
No. Think, Maghra.

10:02.436 --> 10:05.480
If they truly have sighted soldiers,
we're at even more of a disadvantage.

10:05.564 --> 10:07.441
You will have sighted soldiers too.

10:08.358 --> 10:09.818
-No.
-We're going.

10:10.819 --> 10:12.196
You are not soldiers.

10:12.821 --> 10:15.532
No, we're the children of the queen.
This is our fight too.

10:15.616 --> 10:18.660
Your father is right.
You and your sister have no training.

10:18.744 --> 10:21.538
You cannot be expected to fight
just because you can see.

10:22.331 --> 10:25.584
-I don't wanna intrude on family matters--
-Then do not.

10:25.667 --> 10:30.255
But as you yourself have said many times,
we face a far superior army.

10:32.424 --> 10:35.219
We need every advantage
we can get in this battle.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.804
Sight offers no advantage
on the killing field.

10:38.347 --> 10:40.057
As I have learned with my own children,

10:40.140 --> 10:42.059
more often than not,
their vision betrays them.

10:42.142 --> 10:46.939
And these sighted soldiers will give
Edo's army a false confidence.

10:47.022 --> 10:48.607
We need not do the same with ours.

10:48.690 --> 10:50.734
Edo has developed systems for using them.

10:51.401 --> 10:53.070
I've witnessed it myself.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.114
Papa, you are a great warrior…

10:57.574 --> 11:00.369
but the truth is
there are things we can do that you can't.

11:00.452 --> 11:04.331
That is the same thing that Jerlamarel
said just before I took his eyes.

11:05.541 --> 11:07.543
You can't protect us from this fight.

11:07.626 --> 11:08.919
It is not a fight.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.880
This is a slaughter,
and my children will not be a part of it!

11:11.964 --> 11:13.632
-Yes, I will.
-I will.

11:15.467 --> 11:16.468
Maghra.

11:18.971 --> 11:22.224
-We are not sending our children to war.
-I can't stop them.

11:22.307 --> 11:24.893
You said you became queen to protect them.
And this is what you do?

11:24.977 --> 11:27.521
Do you think it's any easier for me
to let them go?

11:27.604 --> 11:30.357
Believe me, I would like nothing more
than just to lock them up.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.776
Then do that. We will force them to stay.

11:33.610 --> 11:36.405
Haniwa and Kofun are not children anymore.

11:36.488 --> 11:40.158
They're adults
with opinions and ideas of their own.

11:45.664 --> 11:47.416
It was not so long ago

11:47.499 --> 11:51.920
that our entire world
was just the four of us.

11:52.004 --> 11:54.047
We never needed any of this.

11:54.923 --> 11:56.550
When we were all separated,

11:57.342 --> 11:59.803
you must have thought
you would never get your family back.

12:00.304 --> 12:01.722
And now you have.

12:03.432 --> 12:05.100
Let us take our children.

12:05.184 --> 12:07.895
Let us be a family again.
This is not our fight.

12:07.978 --> 12:10.147
Please just stop saying that.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.191
This is a war that was started
by your sister!

12:12.274 --> 12:14.860
No. We've all made choices
that brought us here today.

12:14.943 --> 12:18.363
Now war is upon us,
and we must greet it head-on.

12:22.868 --> 12:26.121
You speak of war as if you've been in one.

12:26.205 --> 12:29.291
You have no idea
what you are sending our children into.

12:29.374 --> 12:32.211
-I am not sending them in--
-Their deaths will be on your hands!

12:52.523 --> 12:57.319
I did everything I could
to avoid this war.

12:59.154 --> 13:02.407
But now I have no choice but to win it.

13:26.431 --> 13:27.641
You can't.

13:34.690 --> 13:35.899
Where are you going?

13:41.113 --> 13:44.741
I'm going to war.
Along with the rest of your family.

13:54.877 --> 13:55.919
Do you wanna count it?

13:56.545 --> 13:58.297
You've never been short before.

13:59.590 --> 14:01.592
And you've never failed to deliver.

14:03.510 --> 14:06.346
Once I take payment,
the contract is sealed.

14:06.430 --> 14:07.681
Say you hear.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.851
Must we go through this every time?

14:11.560 --> 14:12.978
Say you hear.

14:13.061 --> 14:14.479
I hear.

14:14.563 --> 14:18.358
The contract cannot be nullified.
Say you hear.

14:19.860 --> 14:20.861
I hear.

14:21.486 --> 14:23.113
Now get it done.

14:32.623 --> 14:34.875
Instead of lurking around,
why don't you join me?

14:39.087 --> 14:43.133
The man who just left, who was he?

14:46.011 --> 14:47.804
Pray you never have to find out.

15:28.178 --> 15:29.221
Baba?

16:31.617 --> 16:33.202
I know you're there.

16:35.412 --> 16:40.334
You've been inside of me, Kofun.
I recognize your scent in my sleep.

16:43.462 --> 16:45.088
Why do you seem happy?

16:46.006 --> 16:47.549
Why wouldn't I be?

16:48.675 --> 16:51.470
My faith has been restored.

16:51.553 --> 16:53.722
The prophecy remains intact.

16:54.806 --> 16:57.976
Do you understand? You're a sacred
instrument of the God Flame.

17:02.231 --> 17:03.232
The baby…

17:05.358 --> 17:06.568
is it mine?

17:11.281 --> 17:12.406
You know…

17:17.871 --> 17:20.582
-The way every father knows.
-No. You used me.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.669
I don't recall you complaining.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.005
No. Stop!

17:44.648 --> 17:45.774
What are you doing?

17:48.151 --> 17:49.194
What is this?

17:54.449 --> 17:55.701
Stop it right now.

17:57.119 --> 17:58.287
If you want to.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.085
You can put an end to your nightmare.

18:54.927 --> 18:57.054
Promised you I'd never lie to you, Kofun.

18:58.013 --> 18:59.515
So I'm gonna tell you the truth.

19:02.100 --> 19:04.645
You still see yourself as a child…

19:06.313 --> 19:08.148
which makes you a weak man.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.236
The time has come for you to be strong.

19:13.779 --> 19:17.241
This child is your son,
and you'll have to claim him as such.

19:18.909 --> 19:22.204
Regardless of whatever immature shame
you might feel in doing so,

19:22.287 --> 19:25.082
not just because he's your son,
but because he's mine.

19:27.626 --> 19:31.672
This child is vital to the future of Paya.

19:31.755 --> 19:34.508
-What are you talking about?
-I tried to explain it to Jerlamarel,

19:34.591 --> 19:37.970
but he thought his vision meant
he didn't need anyone else.

19:38.053 --> 19:40.806
He could just run off,
start his own world.

19:42.891 --> 19:45.310
This world still belongs to the unsighted.

19:47.187 --> 19:51.775
Only I, a queen ordained by God,
can lift it out of darkness

19:51.859 --> 19:54.111
toward a new future governed by light.

19:54.194 --> 19:55.445
You're not queen anymore.

19:56.321 --> 19:57.906
Of course I am.

19:57.990 --> 20:00.450
It'll all be sorted. It's God's will.

20:01.034 --> 20:03.829
Was it God's will for you
to murder the people of Kanzua?

20:04.413 --> 20:06.957
Destroying Kanzua brought me here.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.001
To you. To our baby.

20:11.378 --> 20:14.089
They are going to kill you
the moment it's born.

20:15.257 --> 20:17.509
Your baby will be an orphan.

20:18.760 --> 20:21.597
No. He's the son of a prince.

20:23.640 --> 20:25.100
I'm nobody's father.

20:28.353 --> 20:31.190
If you abandon him,
you're no different than Jerlamarel.

20:32.941 --> 20:34.693
Tell them the truth, Kofun.

20:35.652 --> 20:36.862
He's your blood.

20:37.988 --> 20:40.574
If you die in battle,
the truth will die with you.

20:41.909 --> 20:42.910
Tell them!

20:44.036 --> 20:46.413
Be a fucking man!

20:47.539 --> 20:48.999
Your Majesty.

20:50.501 --> 20:54.213
I heard a rumor that the queen herself
was girding for battle.

20:55.172 --> 20:57.090
And you think you should stop me?

20:57.174 --> 20:59.259
I'm not thinking of you at all.

20:59.343 --> 21:02.429
I'm thinking of the soldiers
who will die trying to protect you.

21:03.096 --> 21:04.806
Well, no one need protect me.

21:04.890 --> 21:08.310
There's little purpose in the queen coming
if she doesn't make it known she's coming.

21:08.393 --> 21:11.605
And once she makes it known,
her army will be more focused

21:11.688 --> 21:13.357
on her safety than victory.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.025
She will be a liability.

21:16.235 --> 21:18.111
Do you understand
what you're asking of me?

21:18.195 --> 21:19.655
I'm not asking.

21:20.948 --> 21:22.741
I'm not my sister.

21:22.824 --> 21:25.494
I will not send my people,
my family, into battle

21:25.577 --> 21:28.330
while I sit at home, drinking tea.

21:28.413 --> 21:31.416
That's the reaction of a mother,
not a queen.

21:32.334 --> 21:35.462
Sentimental, not practical.

21:38.298 --> 21:40.509
My job is to win this battle.

21:40.592 --> 21:43.387
And I will not have
my battle plan compromised.

21:43.470 --> 21:44.888
Not even by you.

21:45.806 --> 21:47.015
Sentimental?

21:48.767 --> 21:50.853
So what do you propose I do?

21:52.396 --> 21:53.605
You will do…

21:54.731 --> 21:56.775
what every great leader must do.

21:58.777 --> 22:01.530
Bless and inspire your army.

22:02.823 --> 22:05.534
And be there to pick up the pieces
when we return.

22:07.452 --> 22:08.579
You're serious.

22:09.663 --> 22:11.665
Have you ever known me to be otherwise?

23:13.769 --> 23:16.188
I understand you'll be joining us.

23:28.575 --> 23:32.579
It doesn't sound like ordinary God bone.
May I?

23:38.836 --> 23:39.837
Heavy.

23:40.754 --> 23:42.005
Unwieldy.

23:43.882 --> 23:45.551
For a small hand, yes.

23:50.597 --> 23:52.307
A surreal set of alliances.

23:53.392 --> 23:57.855
You are fighting with your former enemy
against your former home.

23:58.647 --> 24:01.400
I fight for my family, not the crown.

24:01.483 --> 24:05.028
Your wife is the crown.
So is there any difference?

24:08.282 --> 24:09.491
I understand.

24:11.952 --> 24:15.497
I once was a husband.

24:16.456 --> 24:17.583
And a father.

24:21.962 --> 24:22.963
Kanzua.

24:23.964 --> 24:26.383
Yes. Kanzua.

24:32.514 --> 24:33.932
Sorry for your loss.

24:35.601 --> 24:39.062
You spent years
fighting in the service of your family.

24:40.898 --> 24:44.026
And I lost my family
in the service of the fight.

24:47.487 --> 24:49.698
I do hope yours fares better than mine.

24:54.661 --> 24:57.539
My own brother
stands between us and victory.

24:59.166 --> 25:02.044
No matter the outcome, I will lose.

25:04.171 --> 25:06.590
If there's a better definition of war…

25:08.133 --> 25:09.843
I have yet to hear it.

25:10.886 --> 25:12.221
You know we can't win.

25:13.722 --> 25:16.600
They are better trained.
They are better armed.

25:19.436 --> 25:21.271
At least there's fewer of us.

25:29.238 --> 25:31.031
You and I are soldiers.

25:32.157 --> 25:34.701
We fight even when we know
we're gonna lose.

25:37.079 --> 25:39.164
That's what makes us different
than the others.

25:39.248 --> 25:40.457
I'm not a soldier.

25:42.334 --> 25:43.544
I come to win.

26:08.777 --> 26:10.445
-Your Majesty.
-Captain.

26:10.529 --> 26:12.197
The heralds are ready to announce you.

26:12.281 --> 26:13.448
Thank you.

26:16.285 --> 26:18.620
How do I send people
off to a war I didn't start?

26:20.289 --> 26:22.791
-Are you asking my advice?
-Yes.

26:22.875 --> 26:24.293
Excellent.

26:24.376 --> 26:26.503
I have none to give,
but thank you for asking.

26:30.340 --> 26:31.758
Listen to me.

26:33.218 --> 26:35.304
This is the role you were born for.

26:36.972 --> 26:39.474
I don't doubt for an instant
you'll find the words.

26:41.894 --> 26:43.604
-Harlan.
-The queen is ready.

26:44.479 --> 26:45.689
Yes, sir.

26:59.244 --> 27:00.787
Her Majesty the queen.

27:11.381 --> 27:12.382
Charlotte.

27:14.092 --> 27:16.345
You didn't think
I'd let you sneak off again, did you?

27:16.428 --> 27:18.889
I thought the Compass stayed out
of war and politics.

27:18.972 --> 27:20.015
We do.

27:20.098 --> 27:22.392
My only charge, though,
is to bring you back alive.

27:22.476 --> 27:25.479
And if that means killing a whole mess
of Trivantian soldiers, so be it.

27:25.562 --> 27:27.105
-Hey, Kofun.
-Haniwa.

28:03.684 --> 28:05.352
Citizens of Paya.

28:11.984 --> 28:15.445
My sister has put our nation
in great jeopardy.

28:17.322 --> 28:20.284
It was because of
her manipulation and lies

28:20.993 --> 28:25.289
that we now face the Trivantian army
at our doorstep.

28:27.207 --> 28:28.709
I won't deny this.

28:29.710 --> 28:31.211
You've been lied to enough.

28:32.713 --> 28:35.424
From this queen,
you will only hear the truth.

28:39.303 --> 28:40.762
And the truth is…

28:42.472 --> 28:45.475
we face an enemy
more powerful than we are.

28:46.685 --> 28:48.103
They have more men.

28:48.854 --> 28:51.356
They are better armed and better trained.

28:52.774 --> 28:54.526
So if you are afraid…

28:55.986 --> 28:57.779
know that you are not alone.

29:00.991 --> 29:04.077
Unlike my sister, I am a mother and wife.

29:05.954 --> 29:07.581
And I am terrified.

29:09.958 --> 29:13.629
For many years, I made my home
in the mountains with the Alkenny,

29:13.712 --> 29:18.217
where we cherished nothing
above family and community,

29:18.300 --> 29:20.802
and where every life was precious.

29:22.513 --> 29:25.390
And I address you now, not as your queen,

29:25.974 --> 29:29.353
but as a mother and a wife.

29:30.646 --> 29:33.649
And I address you, not as warriors,

29:33.732 --> 29:38.028
but husbands and wives,
and sons and daughters.

29:38.111 --> 29:39.905
We are all scared.

29:40.572 --> 29:42.908
And we all have so much to lose.

29:44.660 --> 29:46.328
So at this moment…

29:47.746 --> 29:49.581
I offer you this comfort.

29:51.792 --> 29:54.962
In all the generations
that Paya has struggled

29:55.045 --> 29:57.005
to survive Trivantian aggression…

29:58.674 --> 30:00.634
we have never been conquered.

30:01.176 --> 30:06.598
Trivantian boots have never walked
on this soil, and they never will!

30:10.644 --> 30:14.731
No amount of God bone or fire
will ever be enough

30:14.815 --> 30:16.984
to separate us from this land,

30:17.067 --> 30:21.280
the land of our families,
the land of our ancestors!

30:27.411 --> 30:31.707
I believe in a future
far better than our past.

30:31.790 --> 30:35.711
One where we and our families
will thrive and prosper

30:35.794 --> 30:39.965
in a land safe from hate and bigotry,

30:40.048 --> 30:42.718
and safe from invading armies.

30:42.801 --> 30:46.430
And it is that future we fight for today.

30:48.473 --> 30:50.142
So, my fellow Payans…

30:51.476 --> 30:55.439
brave sons and daughters of Paya…

30:57.191 --> 30:58.442
be swift.

30:59.651 --> 31:01.153
Be strong.

31:02.112 --> 31:03.780
And let the enemy know

31:03.864 --> 31:07.284
that their blood may fall on our land,

31:07.367 --> 31:11.622
but it will remain, now and forever,

31:11.705 --> 31:14.416
Payan land!

31:34.978 --> 31:36.980
-Tak!
-Tak!

31:42.819 --> 31:43.820
Paris.

31:43.904 --> 31:46.907
Here, Baba Voss, at your side.

31:48.909 --> 31:51.078
You will face Edo again.

31:53.038 --> 31:54.748
I cannot kill my own brother.

31:54.831 --> 31:56.250
Then he will kill you.

31:57.209 --> 31:58.710
Maybe.

31:58.794 --> 32:00.712
And you think then you'll be absolved?

32:01.380 --> 32:03.298
Use your mind, lump.

32:04.424 --> 32:07.803
Think of your children.
Who will protect them from him?

32:09.054 --> 32:11.557
-You will.
-Don't be daft, Baba.

32:13.725 --> 32:15.310
I've never thanked you.

32:15.394 --> 32:16.395
For what?

32:18.188 --> 32:19.690
Everything.

32:20.190 --> 32:21.191
All of it.

32:22.234 --> 32:25.737
You bring your children back to me safely,
and it's settled.

32:28.031 --> 32:29.032
Yes.

32:31.493 --> 32:33.370
But I need you to do something for me.

32:46.008 --> 32:47.092
Mama.

32:48.927 --> 32:49.928
My children.

32:53.891 --> 32:56.351
I wish I could convince you
to stay here with me.

32:57.311 --> 33:00.814
What kind of princess and prince
would we be if we hid from the war?

33:01.732 --> 33:03.483
I chose this. You didn't.

33:03.567 --> 33:04.776
We choose it now.

33:14.620 --> 33:16.079
Take care of each other.

33:17.623 --> 33:18.916
-We will.
-We will.

33:18.999 --> 33:20.167
We promise.

33:21.210 --> 33:22.211
Go on.

33:26.798 --> 33:27.799
Maghra.

33:30.344 --> 33:31.428
Baba.

33:34.348 --> 33:35.724
Come back to me.

33:36.808 --> 33:38.101
With our family.

33:43.941 --> 33:44.983
Yes.

34:31.697 --> 34:32.947
Toad!

34:33.031 --> 34:34.241
Here, Paris.

34:37.911 --> 34:39.496
I heard they had you on home defense.

34:41.164 --> 34:44.251
A soldier of my rank and skill
building barricades.

34:44.333 --> 34:45.793
I should be on the front lines.

34:45.878 --> 34:48.088
If I had known you'd take it so hard,

34:48.172 --> 34:50.799
I would've thought twice
before asking the queen to arrange it.

34:53.217 --> 34:54.469
What are you talking about?

34:54.553 --> 34:58.056
I have to take a trip.
I thought you might want to come with me.

34:59.766 --> 35:00.851
Where are we going?

35:00.934 --> 35:02.853
I'll explain on the way.

35:02.936 --> 35:04.146
Prepare a horse for me.

35:04.730 --> 35:06.607
A good horse. Your horse!

35:07.274 --> 35:08.567
We leave at once.

35:33.383 --> 35:34.593
It's an airplane.

35:35.886 --> 35:36.887
Yeah.

35:38.889 --> 35:42.518
Must have been so terrifying,
falling out of the sky in a metal tube.

35:44.228 --> 35:47.314
Almost like they had no business
being up there in the first place.

36:04.248 --> 36:07.000
This saddle is not soft.

36:07.501 --> 36:09.294
Did you ever hear of oiling a saddle?

36:10.671 --> 36:14.508
Sometimes a simple "thank you"
is all you have to say.

36:16.510 --> 36:18.053
You're in a mood.

36:19.221 --> 36:22.349
I'm used to marching toward the fight,
not away from it.

36:23.350 --> 36:27.521
This war is gonna be so much bigger
than one battle.

36:27.604 --> 36:29.106
Not if we lose this one.

36:29.731 --> 36:32.109
This war is not about Trivantes and Paya.

36:33.986 --> 36:36.530
The world is about to change, Toad.

36:36.613 --> 36:38.198
Sight is returning.

36:39.324 --> 36:40.951
That's what this war is about,

36:41.994 --> 36:44.621
even if those who wage it are unaware.

36:45.330 --> 36:46.582
What I'm aware of is that

36:46.665 --> 36:50.377
our new queen is asking us
not only to forget our beliefs,

36:51.253 --> 36:52.880
but to go to war against them.

36:52.963 --> 36:55.424
Maghra is much more than a Kane.

36:56.175 --> 37:01.180
She is Haniwa and Kofun's mother.
They hold the keys to our future.

37:02.264 --> 37:04.099
Have you dreamed that future?

37:05.017 --> 37:06.727
I dream multiple futures.

37:11.023 --> 37:12.733
And on what do they depend?

37:13.775 --> 37:18.447
They depend on small things like
you and me making this journey safely.

37:21.950 --> 37:23.660
None of this makes any sense.

37:25.245 --> 37:26.496
Then why did you come?

37:29.791 --> 37:31.084
Because you asked me to.

37:34.713 --> 37:36.340
We camp here for the night.

37:37.341 --> 37:39.510
God Flame is still strong.
We should press further.

37:39.593 --> 37:41.512
No. I have my reasons.

37:42.346 --> 37:43.972
This is the spot.

38:05.827 --> 38:07.579
You should sleep here with me.

38:19.091 --> 38:20.384
What did you say?

38:23.804 --> 38:26.014
We'll be warmer if we sleep together.

38:35.816 --> 38:37.609
Point well taken, soldier.

38:45.450 --> 38:47.119
I'll be a perfect gentleman.

38:50.706 --> 38:55.294
If I thought that were true,
I wouldn't bother coming over here.

39:08.557 --> 39:09.933
Someone's out there.

39:27.618 --> 39:29.244
What's troubling you, Kofun?

39:31.997 --> 39:35.584
Besides going into battle with
the most powerful army on the continent?

39:36.126 --> 39:37.628
Yes, aside from that.

39:40.672 --> 39:41.798
Nothing. I'm fine.

39:41.882 --> 39:45.928
Come on. You've barely said a word
since I got back from the peace summit.

39:48.472 --> 39:50.098
It's been kind of a busy time.

39:51.266 --> 39:52.768
Our mother is the queen.

39:53.602 --> 39:56.647
You're a prince. I'm a princess…

39:58.357 --> 40:00.776
We're going to war,
and you have nothing to say?

40:05.113 --> 40:06.281
What are you reading?

40:09.409 --> 40:12.120
It's a book of poems.
I found it in Trivantes.

40:13.455 --> 40:14.957
There were books in Trivantes?

40:15.624 --> 40:17.709
There were lots of surprises in Trivantes.

40:21.296 --> 40:23.048
Will you read something to me?

40:23.131 --> 40:24.341
Read it yourself.

40:25.592 --> 40:26.718
Please?

40:33.267 --> 40:39.898
"Turning and turning in the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;

40:42.025 --> 40:46.530
Things fall apart; the center cannot hold;

40:48.448 --> 40:51.326
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,

40:53.245 --> 40:55.998
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed…

40:57.958 --> 40:59.293
and everywhere

40:59.376 --> 41:02.129
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;

41:04.548 --> 41:08.427
The best lack all conviction,
while the worst

41:08.510 --> 41:11.138
Are full of passionate intensity.

41:14.558 --> 41:17.311
Surely some revelation is at hand;

41:18.228 --> 41:21.273
Surely the Second Coming is at hand.

41:22.107 --> 41:23.442
The Second Coming!

41:25.819 --> 41:27.654
Hardly are those words out

41:27.738 --> 41:31.909
When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
Troubles my sight:

41:33.577 --> 41:36.246
somewhere in the sands of the desert

41:36.330 --> 41:39.625
A shape with lion body
and the head of a man,

41:40.501 --> 41:44.004
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,

41:44.087 --> 41:47.674
Is moving its slow thighs,
while all about it

41:47.758 --> 41:50.385
Reel shadows
of the indignant desert birds.

41:52.179 --> 41:55.599
The darkness drops again; but now I know

41:55.682 --> 41:58.852
That twenty centuries of stony sleep

41:58.936 --> 42:02.856
Were vexed to nightmare
by a rocking cradle,

42:06.235 --> 42:08.570
And what rough beast,

42:08.654 --> 42:10.572
its hour come round at last,

42:11.198 --> 42:14.868
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?"

43:58.263 --> 43:59.765
-Maghra, run!
-Harlan!

44:03.977 --> 44:04.978
Harlan!

44:12.277 --> 44:13.820
Trivantian fuckers!

45:00.075 --> 45:01.451
Harlan?

45:01.535 --> 45:02.619
Maghra.

45:04.788 --> 45:07.040
I'm so pleased I stayed to protect you.

45:07.124 --> 45:08.667
Where are you hurt?

45:08.750 --> 45:10.544
Pretty much everywhere.

45:10.627 --> 45:12.921
-Are there more of them?
-I don't think so.

45:13.005 --> 45:14.089
Guards!

45:15.174 --> 45:16.717
No, stay with me.

45:18.677 --> 45:20.179
I thought you'd never ask.

45:41.825 --> 45:45.370
We made it here before the Trivantians.
Make base!

45:55.672 --> 45:57.925
We're now at 160 fighters.

45:58.008 --> 46:00.761
We picked up another ten recruits
from towns along the way.

46:02.429 --> 46:05.224
If the Trivantians are indeed 250 strong…

46:06.099 --> 46:09.269
This fort was designed to eliminate
any advantage of numbers.

46:09.353 --> 46:12.648
The narrow trenches will squeeze
the Trivantians

46:12.731 --> 46:14.316
and equalize the battlefield.

46:15.567 --> 46:17.319
Have you fought here before?

46:18.862 --> 46:19.863
Never.

46:38.090 --> 46:39.174
They're here.

46:40.175 --> 46:41.343
Papa.

47:24.469 --> 47:25.888
There's too many of them.

47:26.930 --> 47:28.140
Ayura.

47:35.314 --> 47:37.816
I count close to 350, sir.

47:42.112 --> 47:44.531
Gosset's spies were wrong.

48:07.346 --> 48:08.430
They're here.

48:09.932 --> 48:11.558
Earlier than we anticipated.

48:12.226 --> 48:14.978
It won't matter. Who do you see?

48:16.605 --> 48:18.524
About a hundred soldiers
in front of the gate.

48:18.607 --> 48:20.400
There'll be more inside the fort.

48:20.484 --> 48:21.485
Captain…

48:22.653 --> 48:24.404
I did not ask what you see.

48:24.488 --> 48:27.741
I asked, "Who do you see?"

48:33.664 --> 48:35.040
I see Baba Voss.

48:35.999 --> 48:37.000
Good.

48:38.460 --> 48:40.045
We fight them in the trenches.

48:40.128 --> 48:41.547
That's where we'll have the advantage.

48:41.630 --> 48:42.965
Drummers!

48:44.758 --> 48:46.051
Will it be enough?

48:46.134 --> 48:47.177
No.

48:47.261 --> 48:50.389
But at least we'll kill many more of them
before we're overrun.

48:53.600 --> 48:55.435
-No.
-What are you doing?

48:55.519 --> 48:56.728
Charlotte.

48:56.812 --> 48:57.980
Someone has to stop this.

48:58.605 --> 49:01.817
-What are you talking about?
-I have a friend on the other side.

49:01.900 --> 49:04.361
If I can get to them and tell them
the queen has been deposed--

49:04.444 --> 49:07.364
-Haniwa, they will kill you.
-You have to trust me.

49:12.703 --> 49:13.704
Papa.

49:20.419 --> 49:21.545
Let her go.

49:21.628 --> 49:22.671
What?

49:23.964 --> 49:25.591
We're out of choices, my boy.

49:27.050 --> 49:28.135
Let her try.

49:56.622 --> 49:59.208
-You shouldn't be here.
-None of us should be here.

50:02.294 --> 50:04.963
What you did at the peace conference…

50:05.047 --> 50:06.965
It was Queen Kane
who attacked your people.

50:07.549 --> 50:11.970
She would do anything for her holy war.
You need to know that it wasn't us.

50:13.263 --> 50:16.016
Wren, I would die before I hurt you.
You have to believe that.

50:21.605 --> 50:22.981
I do believe you.

50:25.901 --> 50:27.986
The queen is no longer in power.

50:28.070 --> 50:30.072
My mother took the throne
as soon as we got back.

50:30.906 --> 50:32.032
Maghra's the queen?

50:32.115 --> 50:34.576
Yes. And she does not want this war.

50:34.660 --> 50:36.370
You could talk to Edo.

50:38.413 --> 50:39.915
No, he won't listen to me.

50:39.998 --> 50:41.667
You have to try.

50:43.252 --> 50:45.921
Hundreds of Trivantians and Payans
will die for a lie

50:46.004 --> 50:48.423
if we don't stop this right now.

50:51.385 --> 50:54.179
It's too late. You have to go back.

50:54.263 --> 50:55.347
What?

50:58.433 --> 51:00.310
-Wren.
-Archers!

51:02.479 --> 51:03.480
Run.

51:04.231 --> 51:05.649
Arrows up!

51:07.067 --> 51:08.235
Fire!
