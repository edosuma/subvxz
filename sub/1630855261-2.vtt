WEBVTT

00:04.272 --> 00:06.474
and I voted off Cameron.

00:06.574 --> 00:07.841
I felt really bad about it.

00:07.941 --> 00:10.544
I think Cameron was
a really sweet person.

00:10.644 --> 00:12.313
But I did have
to make a decision

00:12.413 --> 00:15.483
and I did feel, like,
the least connection with him.

00:16.250 --> 00:17.751
I know I've only been here
for a little bit

00:17.851 --> 00:20.821
but I've already made so many
connections with the daters.

00:20.921 --> 00:24.458
But I think that they act
differently around me.

00:24.558 --> 00:25.859
It's like they kind of, like,
put on a show,

00:25.959 --> 00:28.028
like they want to impress me.
And I get that.

00:28.129 --> 00:30.498
In a way, like,
I wish I could know

00:30.631 --> 00:32.966
how everyone's acting
when I'm not in the house.

00:33.067 --> 00:34.435
That's definitely a concern.

01:05.199 --> 01:06.300
Feels good, huh?

01:06.400 --> 01:07.601
Yeah, it does, actually.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.203
[Sienna] Tyler's
playing with me.

01:09.303 --> 01:11.172
It's usually
an immediate turn-off

01:11.272 --> 01:13.241
when a guy is not
accepting the fact

01:13.341 --> 01:15.376
that I'm like,
"I'm a lesbian."

01:15.476 --> 01:17.345
But, I like someone
who's really confident

01:17.445 --> 01:18.545
and doesn't get embarrassed.

01:18.646 --> 01:20.281
He's doing thirst traps
in front of me.

01:20.381 --> 01:21.914
Like, making thirst traps.

01:22.015 --> 01:24.352
And... it's honestly a vibe.

01:24.452 --> 01:25.753
He's kinda cute.

01:25.853 --> 01:27.788
I was worried about you.
You're getting sunburned.

01:28.055 --> 01:29.123
Yeah?

01:30.558 --> 01:32.560
-Oh.
-That felt so good. Thank you.

01:33.727 --> 01:34.928
Listen...

01:35.027 --> 01:38.666
I know the main goal was
supposed to be going after Lexi.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.601
I tend to forget that easily.

01:40.701 --> 01:41.969
Because she's not
around all the time.

01:42.069 --> 01:44.738
I don't think I'll be
the only one, though.

01:45.239 --> 01:46.940
I won't be the only one.

01:49.910 --> 01:51.745
[Rylin] I do think you should
put me as your screensaver.

01:51.845 --> 01:53.847
-Alright.
-Do you want to have just me?

01:54.348 --> 01:56.283
Or do you want the ones of us?

01:56.384 --> 01:57.884
Can you send me one of both?

01:57.985 --> 02:01.855
I can put the one of us
together as my home.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.725
And I can use the one of you
as my lock screen.

02:04.825 --> 02:06.627
-Good.
-So people know what's up.

02:07.060 --> 02:08.429
That's so cute.

02:08.529 --> 02:11.232
So I'm worried because
the other contestants are like--

02:11.765 --> 02:14.435
There'd be flirting
or, like, hitting on me.

02:14.535 --> 02:16.069
And even one of them
tried to kiss me.

02:16.170 --> 02:18.972
And I'm like,
"Guys, if that gets back to her,

02:19.072 --> 02:20.674
like, my chances are done."

02:20.774 --> 02:22.910
What do you think Lexi'll think
if you open your phone

02:23.010 --> 02:25.613
and there's just a picture of me
as the background?

02:25.713 --> 02:27.281
She really does not
have to know.

02:28.282 --> 02:32.253
You want to not tell her!
Already, keeping secrets.

02:32.586 --> 02:34.655
Okay, and you say you're not
trying to keep a secret?

02:34.755 --> 02:37.124
Well, because if you're
willing to keep secrets

02:37.225 --> 02:38.692
from other people
you're pursuing,

02:38.792 --> 02:40.394
you would keep secrets from me.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.696
Not when it's me and you
against the world.

02:43.364 --> 02:45.699
I noticed three other girls
for sure.

02:45.799 --> 02:48.769
I love Jasmine's curly hair.
Rylin had a bunch of confidence

02:48.869 --> 02:50.471
and just overall good vibes.

02:50.571 --> 02:52.105
And Jayme,
she's just really pretty.

02:52.206 --> 02:53.906
[Rylin] No [bleep] way.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.142
No way.

02:55.243 --> 02:57.278
You are too much.
You're a trip.

02:57.378 --> 02:58.412
[Josh] Lexi's not here.

02:58.512 --> 02:59.913
That's why everybody act
like this.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.014
'Cause Lexi not here.

03:01.114 --> 03:02.716
You need the game
to be about the game.

03:02.816 --> 03:04.585
I feel like I gotta be
the real dude in the house.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.754
It's a lot
of fake stuff going on,

03:06.854 --> 03:08.289
so I just gotta keep it real.

03:08.389 --> 03:10.658
[Kalysta] Something's goin' on
with Jayme and I know it.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.793
First of all, it's like,
you're gonna put Jayme

03:12.893 --> 03:15.929
as your number one but you don't
even know about her and Sienna.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.097
Sienna--

03:17.197 --> 03:19.700
When you don't even know
about her and Sienna.

03:19.800 --> 03:23.603
Tyler, Jayme and Sienna--
Those are, like, my homies,

03:23.704 --> 03:27.040
but they got a little suss thing
going on right there.

03:27.140 --> 03:28.809
We came here for Lexi.

03:28.909 --> 03:31.879
And you're out here
spitting game to other girls?

03:32.346 --> 03:33.614
Wait. How do you know?

03:33.714 --> 03:35.516
'Cause we're in the loop.

03:35.683 --> 03:37.751
Wait, did she tell you
last night?

03:37.851 --> 03:41.255
-No, we just in the loop.
-Yeah. We're just in there.

03:41.355 --> 03:43.824
[girls chatting]

03:46.627 --> 03:51.865
Okay, so I had no idea
that Jayme was gonna be here.

03:52.633 --> 03:53.934
I'm getting red.

03:54.034 --> 03:57.338
But I do have a little bit
of history with Jayme.

03:57.438 --> 03:58.606
[Sienna chuckles]

03:58.706 --> 04:00.608
Um, we went on a date.

04:00.708 --> 04:05.613
And we've been on more dates
since that initial date.

04:05.713 --> 04:08.148
We were never official.
We never...

04:08.449 --> 04:10.017
She was never my girlfriend.

04:10.117 --> 04:11.919
So she's my friend.

04:12.019 --> 04:13.287
Mm.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.589
[whispering]

04:20.461 --> 04:23.464
Jayme and I met
back in Santa Barbara.

04:23.564 --> 04:26.367
And now we're here.

04:26.467 --> 04:27.968
And I don't know
what to do with that.

04:28.068 --> 04:30.638
[speaking quietly]

04:36.176 --> 04:38.546
[whispering]

04:39.279 --> 04:41.081
[Sienna] Jayme was always--
She was very difficult.

04:41.181 --> 04:44.784
Like, she was
very distant from me.

04:44.885 --> 04:49.022
I asked Jayme to be
my girlfriend and she said no.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.558
[speaking quietly]

05:02.970 --> 05:05.573
Tyler and Sienna were
kinda hitting it off a bit.

05:05.673 --> 05:08.275
And I noticed myself
getting jealous.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.213
But it just makes things
[bleep] weird.

05:13.313 --> 05:16.684
Imagine your ex is here
trying to be with someone else.

05:16.784 --> 05:17.818
Oh that's tough, though.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.720
Aren't you guys
in the same room?

05:26.727 --> 05:28.629
I don't want my energy
to be taken up

05:28.729 --> 05:30.030
by Sienna and what she's doing.

05:30.130 --> 05:33.200
I don't want that to distract me
from why I'm here.

05:33.300 --> 05:34.902
Can I get a goodnight hug?

05:35.202 --> 05:38.506
-What is up with her today?
-It's civility, it's civility.

05:38.606 --> 05:40.941
What did I do to you
that was so bad today?

05:41.341 --> 05:42.576
Run the clip back.

05:42.676 --> 05:43.844
[Sienna mumbles]

05:43.944 --> 05:45.846
What was the clip?
'Cause you're mumbling.

05:47.915 --> 05:49.750
You wanna be friends?
We can be friends.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.619
But stay consistent about it.

05:51.719 --> 05:53.387
What? I've stayed consistent
with it.

05:53.487 --> 05:54.855
I've stayed friends
the whole time.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.156
I've heard of love triangles.

05:56.390 --> 05:58.659
But I think I might be
in a love diamond. You know?

05:58.759 --> 06:03.196
Jayme, Tyler, and at the center,
my love, Lexi.

06:03.296 --> 06:06.366
So, uh, yeah, we're gonna see
how this all goes.

06:06.467 --> 06:07.935
This is a lot to balance.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.970
* When I wake up I drink
eight cups of that agua *

06:10.070 --> 06:13.607
* Chase my paper
See you later, hasta maÃ±ana *

06:13.841 --> 06:17.177
* Apply my makeup
with my pink puff... *

06:17.277 --> 06:19.379
Hello, hello, hello!

06:19.480 --> 06:22.916
[Anthony] It's Day Two and we're
down to six people on each team.

06:23.016 --> 06:25.419
Yeah. Today's our first
real challenge.

06:25.519 --> 06:27.855
So we're going to be able to see
what these daters are made of.

06:27.955 --> 06:29.289
Luis was in the bottom two,

06:29.423 --> 06:31.892
so I'm gonna check in with him,
see how he's feeling,

06:31.992 --> 06:34.695
and tell him what he can lean
into and pull back a little on.

06:34.795 --> 06:37.831
Luis, you have everything
going for you, okay?

06:38.098 --> 06:40.801
You are attractive,
you are smart, you are fun...

06:40.901 --> 06:42.903
Um, what's our game plan here?

06:43.003 --> 06:44.271
I know the competition's
really tough

06:44.371 --> 06:46.339
and I'm not saying
I'm not going to the finals.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.475
But if anything goes wrong,

06:47.575 --> 06:48.942
I'm trying to find
a backup plan.

06:49.042 --> 06:50.578
That's what you're doing. Okay.

06:50.678 --> 06:51.979
'Cause I was like, "Wait--"

06:52.212 --> 06:54.014
Is that why you're flirting
with what's-her-name? Rylin?

06:54.114 --> 06:56.450
So I'm getting to know Rylin
and she's super fun.

06:56.550 --> 06:58.051
Like, I really [beep]
with her vibe.

06:58.151 --> 07:00.754
It's definitely-- There's
a connection there for sure.

07:00.854 --> 07:02.089
How do you feel
about Lexi right now?

07:02.189 --> 07:04.224
As I've gotten to know her,
like, genuinely,

07:04.324 --> 07:07.861
like, I think she's so sweet,
first of all.

07:07.961 --> 07:09.196
She's super genuine.

07:09.296 --> 07:12.032
She's very confident
in who she is.

07:12.132 --> 07:13.066
Um...

07:13.166 --> 07:14.868
There's still
a lot of time left here.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.870
So you still have
a lot of time with Lexi.

07:16.970 --> 07:20.508
But the truth of the matter is
in these past few days

07:20.608 --> 07:21.775
you've spent most of your time

07:21.875 --> 07:23.410
with the rest of the people
over there.

07:23.511 --> 07:24.778
-Right.
-You know?

07:24.945 --> 07:27.214
And so, have you made
any connections with anybody

07:27.314 --> 07:29.783
beyond just platonic
or just friends?

07:29.883 --> 07:31.852
No, not as I see it.

07:31.952 --> 07:34.922
I think, like, with Luis
it got kind of complicated

07:35.022 --> 07:36.223
because I am very like--

07:36.323 --> 07:38.592
with all my friends
I'll cuddle with them.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.159
And I was cuddling with Jayme.

07:40.260 --> 07:42.596
You know, my roommates
and stuff like that.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.297
But, like, it's platonic.

07:44.397 --> 07:47.300
They're here for Lexi
and they need to remember that.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.702
Lexi's definitely my type.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.938
She's everything
I've been looking for.

07:51.038 --> 07:54.908
I think overall, I'm gonna come
back with my actual confidence.

07:55.008 --> 07:57.044
You know, go in, talk to her
how I talk to everybody else.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.512
I feel like it's gonna
work out for sure.

07:58.612 --> 08:01.882
I do want you to stand up,
let her know how you feel

08:01.982 --> 08:03.517
and start asking her
more questions.

08:03.617 --> 08:05.886
Think of something you can do
for Lexi that's small.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.420
It doesn't have to be,
like, a big thing.

08:07.521 --> 08:09.089
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Cool? Alright.

08:09.356 --> 08:10.257
Thank you so much.

08:10.524 --> 08:12.526
It's hard to read
what's going on with Lexi

08:12.626 --> 08:14.027
and the way she feels
about people,

08:14.127 --> 08:15.362
because we get such small times

08:15.462 --> 08:17.230
where we get to see her
and hang out with her.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.600
I don't want Lexi to think that
I'm drama

08:19.800 --> 08:22.235
or that in any way
this is normal for me

08:22.335 --> 08:24.772
to be involved in,
you know, a love triangle.

08:24.872 --> 08:27.174
I'm trying to just get
as much advice as I can.

08:30.778 --> 08:34.347
[cheering]

08:36.283 --> 08:39.186
How have you guys been doing?
We're having a good time, right?

08:39.286 --> 08:40.621
[cheering]

08:40.721 --> 08:42.455
That's what I'm talking about.

08:42.556 --> 08:44.057
[Lexi] I am really excited

08:44.157 --> 08:47.595
because today we're doing
our first challenge! Whoo!

08:47.695 --> 08:52.766
And I get to see how all
of the daters act in their teams

08:52.866 --> 08:54.735
and how they act
in their challenge,

08:54.835 --> 08:56.336
vying for my attention.

08:56.436 --> 08:58.305
And that's really
where it gets fun.

08:58.405 --> 09:00.841
You guys ready
for our big challenge today?

09:00.941 --> 09:03.076
-[cheering]
-That's what I want to hear.

09:03.176 --> 09:06.279
Who here has slid into
somebody's DMs before?

09:06.379 --> 09:09.349
[Spicy] Uh huh, yep.
That's what we thought.

09:09.449 --> 09:13.253
A lot of great relationships go
from sliding through the DMs.

09:13.353 --> 09:17.490
But you can't just say hi,
or leave a little fire emoji.

09:17.591 --> 09:20.293
So here's how it's going to go
down in the DMs today.

09:20.393 --> 09:23.764
Each of you have submitted
your best pick-up lines.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.265
In the ice box behind you

09:25.365 --> 09:28.101
those pick-up lines
have been frozen.

09:28.201 --> 09:30.270
You will be using
only your bodies

09:30.370 --> 09:34.174
to melt those ice blocks
to reveal the pick-up lines.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.109
[all] Ooh!

09:36.509 --> 09:39.079
I don't know if people do that
on the daily and everything,

09:39.179 --> 09:42.082
but that's not, like,
my go-to for a normal activity.

09:42.182 --> 09:45.686
So, once the ice blocks
have been melted enough

09:45.786 --> 09:47.154
to reveal the pick-up lines,

09:47.254 --> 09:50.290
individual team members will
slide across the slide,

09:50.390 --> 09:53.026
meet another team member
at the end of the slide,

09:53.126 --> 09:55.028
That team member
will then be responsible

09:55.128 --> 09:56.897
for matching that pick-up line

09:56.997 --> 09:58.632
to who they thought
submitted it.

09:58.732 --> 10:01.501
And the team
with the most matches

10:01.601 --> 10:03.170
in the shortest time wins--

10:03.270 --> 10:04.772
You wanna know
what you're winning?

10:04.872 --> 10:06.907
-What?
-Yeah, we do.

10:07.007 --> 10:10.377
The team that wins gets to go
on a group date with me.

10:10.477 --> 10:12.512
[cheering]

10:15.949 --> 10:17.317
Alright, so you guys are gonna
get with your team

10:17.417 --> 10:19.887
and decide who's
doing what right now.

10:19.987 --> 10:22.790
[Kalysta]
Off bat, I need this date.

10:22.890 --> 10:26.093
I need this group date
with Lexi. It's crucial.

10:26.193 --> 10:29.562
Crucial. And it is. [laughs]

10:29.663 --> 10:34.401
[overlapping speech]

10:34.501 --> 10:36.870
[Marc] I want to win
this challenge so bad.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.739
I'm not thinking
about anything else

10:38.839 --> 10:39.807
other than winning.

10:39.907 --> 10:41.040
-All day like--
-[all] Woof!

10:41.141 --> 10:42.209
-All night like--
-[all] Woof!

10:42.309 --> 10:43.343
-All ice like--
-[all] Woof!

10:43.443 --> 10:46.714
-Team Spice like--
-[cheering]

10:47.014 --> 10:50.050
Let's go!
Bring up the energy!

10:52.953 --> 10:55.088
[team chatter]

10:56.556 --> 10:57.925
-Whoo!
-Go!

11:00.761 --> 11:02.662
[shouting, cheering]

11:13.006 --> 11:14.674
These people are nuts!

11:14.775 --> 11:18.779
They're just, like, actually
doing everything they can

11:18.879 --> 11:19.947
to win this challenge

11:20.047 --> 11:21.314
and go on a group date with me.

11:21.414 --> 11:23.650
But I'm like,
"Don't [bleep] hurt yourself."

11:27.420 --> 11:29.356
It's looking really weird
I'm already knowing.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.158
But, I'm just trying to win.
I don't care.

11:31.258 --> 11:32.425
My adrenaline's flowing.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.694
I'm pumped.
I'm like, "We have to win."

11:40.633 --> 11:44.905
We're slippin', we're sliding.
We're slippin', we're sliding.

11:45.005 --> 11:47.174
We're shoo, shoo, shoo!

11:50.510 --> 11:51.779
I already know this.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.914
I said, "Girl, you hotter than
the bottom of my laptop."

11:54.014 --> 11:55.382
'Cause y'all know
laptops get hot.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.985
"I'm no photographer,
but I can picture us together."

11:58.085 --> 12:01.488
"Hi." Next sentence,
"You are so wow."

12:01.588 --> 12:02.522
[crickets chirping]

12:03.490 --> 12:04.191
[bleep]

12:04.291 --> 12:07.360
[chattering, cheering]

12:09.496 --> 12:13.133
I see Kalysta twerking
on the ice block.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.235
I'm carrying the team.
It's bitches standing behind me.

12:15.335 --> 12:16.636
"Oh, I don't want
to get wet."

12:17.137 --> 12:19.139
Get in the ice!
Get in the ice!

12:21.809 --> 12:25.212
[screaming, cheering]

12:28.148 --> 12:29.349
Hurry! Open it.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.118
We're done!

12:32.252 --> 12:34.254
[Spicy] Good job, guys.
Good job, good job.

12:34.354 --> 12:35.889
[Lexi] Wait, we need a medic.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.125
We need a medic, if possible.

12:38.225 --> 12:40.327
-His hand doesn't look okay.
-Medic, medic!

12:40.427 --> 12:42.662
He might have broke his hand
on the ice.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.269
We need a medic, if possible.

12:49.369 --> 12:50.603
His hand doesn't look okay.

12:50.703 --> 12:51.839
Medic, medic.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.673
He might have broke his hand
on the ice.

12:53.773 --> 12:54.875
I looked down at my hand

12:55.075 --> 12:57.310
after I hammer-fisted it
a couple times.

12:57.410 --> 13:01.014
And I started seeing
a little blood come off my hand.

13:01.815 --> 13:04.384
I was trying to hit the ice,
trying to win the date.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.920
Don't even know
what happened to my hand.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.655
But we're gonna see.

13:11.925 --> 13:14.127
Was that not intense, or what?

13:14.227 --> 13:16.229
Right? Like, crazy!

13:16.329 --> 13:17.730
[Spicy] You guys killed it.

13:17.831 --> 13:22.202
Everybody went 100% on this.
It was really impressive.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.471
-[applause]
-Thanks, Coach.

13:24.771 --> 13:27.107
So guys, remember,
a big reason for being here

13:27.207 --> 13:30.377
is also to improve
your dating skills.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.512
So me and Spicy
are gonna be looking

13:32.612 --> 13:34.081
at some of the pick-up lines.

13:34.181 --> 13:36.516
And seeing if there's
any room for improvement.

13:36.616 --> 13:38.051
Ready to get critiqued?

13:38.151 --> 13:39.486
-Yeah.
-Alright.

13:39.586 --> 13:40.988
When it comes to communication,

13:41.088 --> 13:42.956
you want to make sure
it's gonna land.

13:43.056 --> 13:45.192
That the person is gonna
understand what you're saying.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.327
So, you kinda gotta think
two steps ahead.

13:47.427 --> 13:48.862
Sender, receiver.

13:48.962 --> 13:51.098
How's this person gonna receive
what I'm sharing?

13:51.598 --> 13:53.533
"Hope you look
even better in person."

13:53.833 --> 13:57.037
Off the bat,
comes off kind of like,

13:57.137 --> 13:59.039
"Wait, what are you
trying to say?"

13:59.506 --> 14:01.708
If you're gonna
do something like that,

14:02.375 --> 14:05.812
I would try to make it more of,
like, self-deprecating humor.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.048
Start off with something like,

14:08.248 --> 14:10.717
"Trust me,
I look better in person."

14:10.817 --> 14:11.952
It'll be a lot better

14:12.052 --> 14:14.354
than insulting the person
off the bat.

14:15.222 --> 14:16.823
You guys, this one's concerning.

14:16.924 --> 14:20.027
"I can play Cupid's theme
with your G-string"?

14:20.393 --> 14:21.594
Look, I get it.

14:21.694 --> 14:22.996
You might be dealing
with someone

14:23.096 --> 14:24.697
who's hot like Lexi, right?

14:24.797 --> 14:27.500
But she's more
than just a hot girl.

14:27.600 --> 14:28.969
So if you're gonna approach her,

14:29.069 --> 14:31.238
you wanna make sure
you have some respect with it.

14:31.338 --> 14:34.241
And already asking
if you can, like, violate

14:34.574 --> 14:36.609
and mess with her panties...

14:36.709 --> 14:39.579
That's not how we want to go in.
[laughing]

14:40.013 --> 14:42.749
That's not how we want
to start off, right?

14:42.950 --> 14:44.284
So, I want to share

14:44.517 --> 14:47.087
some of my favorite pick-up
lines that I've seen.

14:47.320 --> 14:50.723
Um, and so the first one
probably would have to be,

14:50.823 --> 14:53.193
"I can be the curly fries
to your ketchup."

14:53.293 --> 14:54.427
So who was that?

14:54.527 --> 14:56.163
[Lexi] Good job, Josh.

14:56.263 --> 14:57.297
That's super cute.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.631
The second one

14:58.731 --> 15:01.468
that I thought was really cute
and personal was

15:01.568 --> 15:03.736
"Are you French?
Because Eiffel for you."

15:03.836 --> 15:05.205
And I know
that that was Cyprien,

15:05.305 --> 15:07.340
and I know he's French
so I just thought that was cute.

15:07.440 --> 15:10.978
Lexi tells me that my pick-up
line was her favorite.

15:11.078 --> 15:13.113
My heart! You feel me?
The butterflies.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.647
Everyone knows how that feels.

15:14.747 --> 15:17.417
So, the winning team is,

15:17.517 --> 15:19.119
with three matches,

15:19.219 --> 15:22.555
blowing the other team
out of the water...

15:22.655 --> 15:24.124
Drumroll, please.

15:24.224 --> 15:25.825
Wooh!

15:25.925 --> 15:27.727
Spicy Mari's team!

15:27.827 --> 15:29.829
[screaming, cheering]

15:32.432 --> 15:33.800
[team] Spicy, Spicy!

15:33.900 --> 15:36.003
We freaking won!

15:36.103 --> 15:37.270
Yay!

15:38.705 --> 15:40.207
We're the winners. Yes, we are.

15:40.307 --> 15:42.976
We're the winners, by far!
What?

15:43.076 --> 15:47.114
In high school, they called me
The Comeback King for a reason.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.082
This was super fun, you guys.

15:49.182 --> 15:51.651
But, my winning team,
we gotta get dressed

15:51.751 --> 15:53.653
and get ready
for our group date.

15:53.853 --> 15:55.888
You guys ready to kill it again?

16:11.571 --> 16:15.975
[excited chatter]

16:22.115 --> 16:24.584
[Lexi] So we just found out
the date is at Color Me Mine,

16:24.684 --> 16:26.719
which is a really cool
pottery place

16:26.819 --> 16:28.388
where you get to paint pottery.

16:28.488 --> 16:29.489
Really excited.

16:29.789 --> 16:32.125
I've never done
something like this before.

16:32.225 --> 16:33.793
And I'm also really excited

16:33.893 --> 16:36.429
to get to connect
with everyone in this group

16:36.529 --> 16:37.997
on a more intimate level.

16:38.098 --> 16:40.133
* I know I make you
Feel some way *

16:40.233 --> 16:42.102
* That's not my fault *

16:42.202 --> 16:45.672
* I'm on a wave now
You fallin' off... *

16:46.073 --> 16:48.675
Wait, I'm literally so happy
that this is the challenge.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.477
You guys have no idea.
This'll be fun.

16:50.677 --> 16:51.778
So, how excited
are you guys

16:51.878 --> 16:53.680
that you, like,
won this challenge?

16:53.780 --> 16:55.515
-Go, Team Spicy!
-Team Spicy's the champions!

16:55.615 --> 16:56.849
Team Spicy!

16:56.949 --> 16:58.385
[Camille] I'm actually
really looking forward

16:58.485 --> 16:59.719
to being able to have

16:59.819 --> 17:02.255
a little bit more
one-on-one time.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.790
I think that being able to be
in a more intimate setting

17:04.891 --> 17:06.126
where we can
all connect with her

17:06.226 --> 17:07.827
is gonna be beneficial for all.

17:07.926 --> 17:09.028
Can we ask you?

17:09.128 --> 17:10.797
In a partner,
what do you look for?

17:10.896 --> 17:12.398
-Oh, that's a good question.
-Yeah.

17:12.499 --> 17:14.101
Um, I think--

17:14.201 --> 17:16.969
Okay, so I was talking to
the dating coaches about this.

17:17.069 --> 17:19.372
-The biggest ones is trust.
-Okay.

17:19.472 --> 17:21.374
Um, like, if I can't
trust the person that I'm with

17:21.473 --> 17:24.611
and if they can't trust me
it's not going to work.

17:24.711 --> 17:25.845
One of my previous
relationships,

17:25.944 --> 17:27.214
my boyfriend would
go through my phone.

17:27.314 --> 17:29.582
That's a huge red flag.
And I look back at it,

17:29.682 --> 17:30.850
and I'm like, "Holy [bleep],

17:30.950 --> 17:32.385
how did I let that happen
for so long?"

17:32.485 --> 17:34.387
-Yeah.
-So, that's, like, big for me.

17:34.487 --> 17:36.989
And then another thing is
that they like to adventure.

17:37.090 --> 17:38.558
I love to travel.

17:38.691 --> 17:41.194
And then I think I would say,
like, the last thing is, like,

17:41.294 --> 17:43.330
just that they're
really supportive as a person

17:43.430 --> 17:46.833
and, like, they support me
in my pursuits and my job,

17:46.933 --> 17:49.269
just like I would support them
in their pursuits.

17:49.602 --> 17:51.171
So, yeah. What about you guys?

17:51.271 --> 17:52.439
What are some deal-breakers?

17:52.805 --> 17:56.876
[Josh] A big thing for me
is motivation, drive, passion...

17:56.976 --> 17:59.045
Having a goal you want
to work towards in life.

17:59.146 --> 18:00.747
You don't have to have
everything figured out,

18:00.847 --> 18:02.349
but just want better
for yourself.

18:02.449 --> 18:03.483
Yeah, I like that a lot.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.084
I feel like
if your dreams don't scare you,

18:05.185 --> 18:06.286
you're not dreaming
big enough.

18:06.386 --> 18:08.688
-Oh I like that.
-That's a good quote.

18:09.322 --> 18:11.524
-Luis, I like that quote.
-Thank you.

18:11.624 --> 18:13.893
[Luis] So, I'm finally
on the date with Lexi.

18:13.993 --> 18:15.695
Overall, I'm just trying
to redeem myself,

18:15.795 --> 18:17.164
trying to see
who she is as a person

18:17.264 --> 18:18.965
and trying to see if we're
compatible. Which we are.

18:19.065 --> 18:20.433
I love adventure.

18:20.533 --> 18:25.004
I feel like if the relationship
is built on experiences,

18:25.104 --> 18:27.874
that's the purest relationship
you can have.

18:27.974 --> 18:30.009
Like, seeing people
in different realms

18:30.109 --> 18:31.678
and doing stuff,

18:31.778 --> 18:33.180
like watching you guys paint--

18:33.280 --> 18:36.048
-and, like, interact with art.
-Yeah.

18:36.149 --> 18:37.450
Like, that's really important.

18:37.550 --> 18:39.352
I feel like we're all artists
in different ways,

18:39.452 --> 18:42.655
-but now we have to paint a cup.
-[all laugh]

18:42.755 --> 18:43.890
-Yeah.
-It's a lot of pressure.

18:43.990 --> 18:45.192
-This is so fun.
-Yeah.

18:45.292 --> 18:46.393
And I feel like if it's someone

18:46.493 --> 18:48.027
that doesn't push you
to do better,

18:48.127 --> 18:50.597
or, like, be a better person
than you were before,

18:50.697 --> 18:51.731
I feel like that won't help

18:51.831 --> 18:52.899
relationship grow
and everything.

18:52.999 --> 18:54.167
Yeah.

18:54.267 --> 18:56.203
Yeah, for me
communication is a big deal.

18:56.303 --> 18:58.037
If you can't sit down
and have a conversation with me,

18:58.137 --> 18:59.906
like, I don't even want
to have anything to do with you.

19:00.006 --> 19:03.109
'Cause, like... maturity is big.

19:03.210 --> 19:05.712
I wonder what they're doing
back at the house without us.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.280
-Crying.
-[Luis] For real.

19:07.380 --> 19:10.183
-Wishing they were us right now.
-Yeah.

19:13.453 --> 19:15.121
Who do y'all think's
gone tonight?

19:15.222 --> 19:17.990
I think everyone's feeling
Lewis, or Luis.

19:18.090 --> 19:19.326
-I think that's--
-Luis, really.

19:19.426 --> 19:20.560
I think that makes
the most sense.

19:20.660 --> 19:21.728
Everyone says Luis.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.430
-Yeah.
-But I really think she's--

19:23.530 --> 19:26.566
She's, like, the type for sure
to try to shock people.

19:26.666 --> 19:27.834
True.

19:28.100 --> 19:30.036
I don't know. Luis is going
on the date right now.

19:30.136 --> 19:33.273
He's trying to redeem himself.
He said that last night.

19:33.440 --> 19:36.909
Unfortunately, we did not win.

19:37.009 --> 19:40.179
Team Anthony, um...
It was disgraceful.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.249
We really did not do
what we should have.

19:42.349 --> 19:44.050
I'm super bummed right now.

19:44.150 --> 19:46.386
Any of y'all feel worried
about tonight?

19:46.486 --> 19:48.455
-I'm not worried.
-Not worried at all?

19:48.555 --> 19:51.258
Well, I don't know if I'm, like,
"I'm the one Lexi wants,"

19:51.358 --> 19:54.794
but I think there's people who
would get the boot before me.

19:54.894 --> 19:57.397
Like, I feel like there's people
I have a better chance than.

19:57.497 --> 19:59.031
-I understand that.
-You know what I mean?

19:59.131 --> 20:00.600
I also think since a guy
was eliminated first,

20:00.700 --> 20:02.402
-it might be a girl.
-That's what I was thinking.

20:02.502 --> 20:04.136
-That's a good point.
-She could be--

20:04.604 --> 20:07.340
I'm really nervous about them
being on a date with her now.

20:07.440 --> 20:10.243
'cause, like I said, these are
all the people she kind of

20:10.343 --> 20:12.312
hasn't seemed
as interested in

20:12.412 --> 20:14.180
or hasn't talked to that much.

20:14.281 --> 20:16.483
And now they're getting
a direct chance

20:16.583 --> 20:19.185
to, like, spend time with her
that we're never gonna have.

20:19.286 --> 20:20.320
We're never gonna have

20:20.687 --> 20:22.389
whatever opportunity
they're doing now with her.

20:22.489 --> 20:23.823
It's gonna be an experience--

20:24.190 --> 20:26.326
[Sienna] The first experience
they get outside.

20:26.426 --> 20:27.226
Exactly.

20:27.327 --> 20:30.029
That makes me so nervous.

20:30.129 --> 20:32.799
Sienna and Jayme,
one of those two girls

20:32.899 --> 20:34.133
are gonna get me
in trouble.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.269
It's about Lexi.
You know, that's my main focus.

20:36.369 --> 20:37.970
I gotta think in my head
what I can do

20:38.070 --> 20:39.472
to make sure she knows that.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.341
So I think I got something
up my sleeve

20:41.441 --> 20:43.443
and we're gonna see
how that plays out.

20:46.379 --> 20:48.080
Wait, can I see everyone's mugs?

20:48.681 --> 20:49.816
That's cute.

20:49.916 --> 20:53.252
[overlapping speech]

20:53.353 --> 20:55.855
I ran out of space
at this point.

20:56.323 --> 20:58.090
[Lexi] Wait, so what are
your guys',

20:58.190 --> 20:59.392
what are your inspirations

20:59.492 --> 21:01.461
for your art pieces?
Like, for your mugs?

21:01.561 --> 21:03.763
-It was obviously chaos.
-[laughter]

21:03.863 --> 21:05.598
[Lexi] Wait, I love it.

21:05.698 --> 21:07.033
I feel like chaos is like,

21:07.133 --> 21:09.035
just a good representation
of coincidences.

21:09.135 --> 21:10.803
-Does that make sense? At all?
-Yeah.

21:10.903 --> 21:12.171
No, I like that.
That's cool.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.906
Your mug is really cool.

21:14.006 --> 21:15.274
[Luis] Thank you.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.244
So many colors...

21:18.345 --> 21:19.512
I wanted to ask you Lexi, like,

21:19.612 --> 21:21.881
what's the most
attractive thing for you?

21:21.981 --> 21:23.115
In a person?

21:23.215 --> 21:24.851
Yeah, like
your go-to personality

21:24.951 --> 21:27.754
Personality. Just, like,
a person who can make me laugh.

21:27.854 --> 21:29.288
Who also doesn't give a [bleep]

21:29.389 --> 21:31.758
about what anybody thinks
about them. That's huge for me.

21:31.858 --> 21:35.061
Like, I really like
confident, independent people.

21:35.161 --> 21:37.664
Um, and then in terms of,
like, looks-wise?

21:37.764 --> 21:40.132
I don't really have a type,
but I do like a person

21:40.232 --> 21:42.635
who can hold
intimate eye contact.

21:43.770 --> 21:45.304
I think that's hot.

21:45.405 --> 21:46.739
[laughs]

21:46.839 --> 21:48.240
I second that, for sure.

21:48.541 --> 21:53.646
Luis is on this date and he is
acting so [bleep] fugaze.

21:53.746 --> 21:57.049
I can literally see right
through this man's bullshit.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.318
I mean, the same shit
he's pulling on Lexi,

21:59.419 --> 22:00.987
he did this shit to Jasmine.

22:01.087 --> 22:03.155
And he did the same
[bleep] thing to Rylin.

22:03.255 --> 22:06.393
I'm like, "This man
is a pretty boy." That is it.

22:06.493 --> 22:08.060
Are any of you religious?

22:08.160 --> 22:09.729
-No.
-I am.

22:11.097 --> 22:12.298
I used to be.

22:12.665 --> 22:15.267
I kinda walked away because
a lot of people in the church

22:15.435 --> 22:16.369
are really judgmental

22:16.469 --> 22:18.004
and, like, really ignorant.

22:18.104 --> 22:19.539
-Yeah.
-So, are you?

22:19.639 --> 22:21.007
I'm not religious.

22:21.107 --> 22:23.943
My grandma is super religious.

22:24.043 --> 22:27.113
And so the first time she ever
found out about my sexuality

22:27.213 --> 22:29.516
was actually
because of this show.

22:29.616 --> 22:30.783
Oh, really?

22:30.883 --> 22:32.151
-Yeah.
-That was new?

22:32.251 --> 22:34.954
Yeah, that was new.
But she's been texting me.

22:35.054 --> 22:37.256
And I honestly think--

22:37.356 --> 22:41.160
like, I think it's better
than I thought it was gonna be.

22:41.260 --> 22:43.430
What is your sexuality?

22:43.530 --> 22:45.632
To me, I see people
as, like, their souls.

22:45.732 --> 22:48.668
Like, it's not about,
like, anything down there.

22:48.768 --> 22:52.739
Like, it's really, I'm not
attracted to a person's gender

22:52.839 --> 22:54.140
or anything like that.

22:54.240 --> 22:56.543
It's, like, their character
and their soul.

22:56.643 --> 23:00.112
Um, and coming out,
I got lucky,

23:00.212 --> 23:03.950
like, I have
a very, very supporting family.

23:04.050 --> 23:06.986
I'm really happy everyone here
is very supportive.

23:07.086 --> 23:08.821
That I'm into girls.

23:08.921 --> 23:11.257
People who aren't, it's just
a lot about them not being able

23:11.357 --> 23:12.792
to deal with
their own insecurities.

23:12.892 --> 23:14.126
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.327
Josh, that's
a really good point.

23:15.428 --> 23:16.529
I know we have
only known each other

23:16.629 --> 23:18.097
for a short amount of time,

23:18.197 --> 23:19.732
but I feel like
I've bonded individually

23:19.832 --> 23:21.233
so much with all of you.

23:21.333 --> 23:23.302
Like, I know little details
about your lives.

23:23.402 --> 23:26.172
And I'm sure there's so much
that I still have to learn.

23:26.539 --> 23:27.740
But that's why we have time.

23:27.840 --> 23:30.209
And that's why
we're doing stuff like this.

23:30.309 --> 23:33.946
[Kalysta] It's nice to see
Lexi's guard come down.

23:34.046 --> 23:36.148
And she can really talk to us

23:36.549 --> 23:41.588
and get personal with us
about certain things.

23:41.688 --> 23:44.691
And it just felt nice to have

23:45.191 --> 23:47.827
some sort of
one-on-one with her.

23:54.501 --> 23:57.436
Yo, how do you think
that date's going?

23:58.404 --> 23:59.806
Honestly, I don't even know
what to expect.

23:59.906 --> 24:02.174
I don't even know
where they are, but...

24:02.274 --> 24:04.911
It's going, that's all I know.
It's going.

24:05.011 --> 24:08.815
They're all realizing they have
to go for Lexi at this point.

24:08.915 --> 24:10.483
People are already
getting put on blast

24:10.583 --> 24:13.920
for trying to have little,
like, groups or whatever.

24:14.020 --> 24:15.121
You know what I'm saying?

24:15.354 --> 24:17.389
Like, people are already
getting put on blast.

24:17.490 --> 24:19.225
I also think
people are realizing that

24:19.325 --> 24:20.560
if they don't step up soon,

24:20.660 --> 24:22.662
they're gonna need to leave...

24:22.762 --> 24:24.997
Yeah, I'm kind of getting
worried about that because,

24:25.097 --> 24:28.134
you know, I feel like
everyone's kind of saying this.

24:28.234 --> 24:31.671
And she might be feeling that
I'm here for the wrong reasons

24:31.771 --> 24:34.340
and necessarily not
as interested in her

24:34.440 --> 24:35.975
as the other girls.

24:36.075 --> 24:39.378
I mean, I kind of thought of,
like, something cool to do.

24:39.712 --> 24:42.248
You know, tonight, just kind of
pull her off to the side

24:42.348 --> 24:43.983
and have, like,
a little picnic or something.

24:44.083 --> 24:45.251
-With you and her?
-Yeah.

24:45.351 --> 24:47.486
-Oh okay.
-I was gonna get this blanket.

24:47.587 --> 24:50.056
-Like, lay it down on the grass.
-Yeah, let me see.

24:50.156 --> 24:52.491
Damn, this dude has it
all planned out and everything.

24:52.592 --> 24:54.927
And then, I was just gonna use
these flowers

24:55.027 --> 24:56.796
The flowers that match. Okay.

24:56.896 --> 24:58.064
Match the blanket.

24:58.164 --> 25:00.199
Ordered food earlier. Got some--
I'll just show you.

25:00.299 --> 25:01.634
Let me see. Yeah.

25:01.734 --> 25:05.037
I know she likes aÃ§ai bowls
and her chocolate cake.

25:05.137 --> 25:06.839
So, you know, we ordered some--

25:06.939 --> 25:08.207
-Dang!
-Yeah.

25:08.307 --> 25:10.276
-So...
-Bro, you went hard. Okay!

25:10.376 --> 25:11.778
Oh, I will be
the first one to tell you

25:11.878 --> 25:15.081
I have been, like, engaging
in flirting with other...

25:15.181 --> 25:17.216
-Right.
-...Sienna and the other girls.

25:17.316 --> 25:19.451
So, I just wanted to, you know.

25:19.552 --> 25:21.654
This is a step towards
the right direction over here.

25:21.754 --> 25:22.922
I wanna
get some stuff straight.

25:23.022 --> 25:25.592
But this is about
to actually make her...

25:25.692 --> 25:27.860
I ain't gonna lie, though,
I need some help setting it up.

25:27.960 --> 25:28.861
Hey, I got you.

25:29.128 --> 25:31.363
We can definitely use
all these right here.

25:31.463 --> 25:33.700
Damn, am I really about to help
my opponent right now?

25:33.800 --> 25:36.969
On a date with my girl, like,
my shorty I'm trying to get at?

25:37.503 --> 25:40.172
But, that's my boy.
I really gotta help him.

25:40.272 --> 25:41.874
I just gotta be a good guy.
You know?

25:41.974 --> 25:44.410
I think Lexi is also
gonna notice that.

25:44.510 --> 25:47.479
"He's helpful, he has
open arms to anyone."

25:49.782 --> 25:52.151
[chuckling]

25:52.484 --> 25:54.553
I feel like we definitely
gotta move the floats.

25:56.322 --> 25:59.058
-Otay.
-This is cute. I like this.

25:59.158 --> 26:00.492
I would say it's pretty good.

26:00.593 --> 26:02.595
-Alright, let's get this food.
-Alright, let's go.

26:03.362 --> 26:05.131
Sheesh!

26:08.968 --> 26:11.437
* Just can't tell at all *

26:11.738 --> 26:14.473
* And I can't tell
if you real or not *

26:14.941 --> 26:16.075
Hey.

26:16.208 --> 26:18.711
* Just can't tell at all *

26:18.811 --> 26:20.279
What's up, shorty?

26:21.047 --> 26:22.281
What's this?

26:24.050 --> 26:26.786
-What is this? Our little date?
-It's a little date.

26:26.886 --> 26:28.254
Oh my god.

26:29.288 --> 26:30.222
This guy.

26:30.456 --> 26:33.893
Tyler set up something
really special for me.

26:33.993 --> 26:36.095
I-- like, I got emotional.

26:36.896 --> 26:38.297
This is so cute.

26:38.397 --> 26:41.934
* Just can't tell at all *

26:44.804 --> 26:47.473
* Just can't tell at all *

26:47.573 --> 26:50.542
[Lexi] Oh my god.
This is so fantastic.

26:56.883 --> 26:58.417
Hmm.

26:59.886 --> 27:00.887
[sighs]

27:00.987 --> 27:02.354
Look at this cheese ball.

27:02.454 --> 27:06.759
On his freaking picnic date
with my girlfriend.

27:06.859 --> 27:08.360
Are we kidding?

27:11.998 --> 27:13.599
What are you doing?

27:13.700 --> 27:15.467
What have you gotten me into?

27:17.003 --> 27:18.738
Oh my gosh.

27:19.238 --> 27:21.340
You got me chocolate cake.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.009
[laughs]

27:23.109 --> 27:25.077
So I had the chance
to talk to Tyler last night.

27:25.177 --> 27:26.412
And when we were talking

27:26.512 --> 27:27.847
I told him about some
of my favorite things,

27:27.947 --> 27:29.816
some of my favorite foods
here in L.A.

27:29.916 --> 27:31.150
And it really meant a lot to me

27:31.250 --> 27:33.152
that he paid attention
to our conversation.

27:33.252 --> 27:34.787
This is like
all of my favorite things.

27:34.887 --> 27:36.055
I feel so spoiled right now.

27:36.823 --> 27:39.859
You had to show up
the other date that was planned?

27:40.159 --> 27:42.361
Yeah, I didn't like it.
I didn't like losing.

27:42.461 --> 27:46.999
Well, you were definitely
trying not to lose.

27:52.104 --> 27:53.773
[muffled shouting]

27:53.873 --> 27:56.743
I am so infuriated.

27:56.843 --> 27:59.445
I am screaming, crying,
throwing up. All of the above.

27:59.545 --> 28:02.414
I feel distraught.
I'm gonna need a counselor,

28:02.514 --> 28:04.717
-a psychologist and medication.
-[laughter]

28:04.817 --> 28:06.853
He's only doing this
'cause he's-- he's nervous.

28:06.953 --> 28:08.187
He's only doing this because

28:08.287 --> 28:09.756
he knows he was
going to get the boot, I get it.

28:09.856 --> 28:11.023
-Yeah.
-I get it.

28:11.123 --> 28:12.892
I get it. He had to say
his last goodbyes.

28:13.059 --> 28:15.094
I get it. It's okay.
It's fine.

28:15.194 --> 28:16.963
Tyler is corny.
Tomato. Tomato.

28:17.063 --> 28:20.232
[all] Tomato, tomato, tomato...!

28:20.332 --> 28:21.734
That's, like,
the nicest thing ever

28:21.834 --> 28:22.969
that anyone's ever done.

28:23.069 --> 28:25.171
I kinda like
having moments, you know?

28:25.271 --> 28:26.739
You're so cute. I can't.

28:26.839 --> 28:28.340
Just to clear it up,

28:28.440 --> 28:31.143
my interests are not
in any of the other two girls

28:31.243 --> 28:32.611
that people are saying
they are.

28:32.711 --> 28:35.748
I might have flirted with them.
That's just me, but...

28:35.848 --> 28:38.484
I hope this shows you
where my interests are at.

28:38.584 --> 28:40.686
No, I really do appreciate this,
like, a lot.

28:40.787 --> 28:42.989
I think this is probably
one of the sweetest things,

28:43.089 --> 28:44.356
like, a guy has done for me.

28:44.456 --> 28:46.926
-Like, I don't--
-No one's ever, like, done this?

28:47.026 --> 28:49.161
-No. No.
-Oh.

28:49.261 --> 28:50.629
Like, actually.

28:51.030 --> 28:52.264
This is, like, really sweet.

28:52.364 --> 28:54.500
Like, it makes my heart
really happy.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.535
This boy is so cute,
and I'm like, "Oh my gosh,

28:56.668 --> 28:58.905
like, how can I be so lucky
to have this experience

28:59.005 --> 29:00.506
with someone who's
so sweet, so kind?"

29:00.606 --> 29:02.574
Most people think I'm, like,
a flirt or a player.

29:02.674 --> 29:06.412
But the truth of the matter is,
I'm from Tuscaloosa, Alabama,

29:06.645 --> 29:08.747
my mom was like,
"I'm not raising no player.

29:08.848 --> 29:10.716
You're gonna treat a girl right
if you're gonna get a girl."

29:10.817 --> 29:14.286
This shows a lot of tenacity,
a lot of effort.

29:14.386 --> 29:17.489
And, like, you're here
for the right reasons,

29:17.589 --> 29:19.725
which I feel like
some people might not be.

29:19.826 --> 29:23.629
So, it-it, like,
actually, like, means a lot.

29:23.729 --> 29:26.232
Yeah sure, well,
I'm glad that you think that.

29:26.332 --> 29:28.734
And looks like
we're on the same page.

29:28.835 --> 29:30.369
[laughs]

29:31.103 --> 29:32.805
You're so cute. I can't.

29:39.912 --> 29:41.180
[Tyler] Oh, here we go.

29:41.280 --> 29:42.849
I can hear the herd.

29:44.116 --> 29:45.517
-Hello.
-Ah!

29:45.617 --> 29:46.518
[laughs]

29:46.618 --> 29:48.320
Why are you
looking at me like that?

29:48.921 --> 29:50.722
[crowd chatters]

30:00.032 --> 30:01.367
Yo, they're talkin' shit.

30:02.034 --> 30:04.837
Apparently people were saying
that was a first date that I had

30:04.937 --> 30:06.305
that wasn't my sister.

30:06.405 --> 30:08.908
-Since he's from Alabama.
-So, I'll ask who it was.

30:09.008 --> 30:10.109
Was it you?

30:10.209 --> 30:11.844
No, but I wish
I would have said it.

30:15.915 --> 30:17.483
I don't want to do more drama.

30:17.583 --> 30:18.784
So, first off,
I just want to know

30:18.985 --> 30:20.486
why Tyler is wearing
the same outfit as me, bro.

30:20.586 --> 30:22.188
-I just want to know that.
-Wow.

30:22.288 --> 30:23.422
I cannot believe this.

30:23.522 --> 30:24.991
-I can't either.
-That's crazy.

30:25.091 --> 30:27.927
We just get back from our date.
He's trying to go on a date.

30:28.027 --> 30:29.328
He can't wait one day?

30:29.595 --> 30:31.730
He put a target on his back
being the first one to do that.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.765
That was a player move.

30:33.866 --> 30:36.402
-He's pushin' P right now.
-He is pushin' P, bro.

30:36.502 --> 30:39.805
It kinda looks like, um,
lookin' in a mirror, bro.

30:39.906 --> 30:40.839
For real?

30:40.940 --> 30:42.508
So you're saying I copied you.

30:43.075 --> 30:44.476
You said it. I'm saying it, bro.

30:44.576 --> 30:45.878
-[laughs]
-[Tyler] Luigi?

30:46.378 --> 30:48.147
I'm not even
saying his name right.

30:48.247 --> 30:50.016
But Luigi is cruisin'.
I'm gettin' hot.

30:50.116 --> 30:51.750
We're rocking the same fit, bro.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.652
And I was wearing this
when I left for my date.

30:53.752 --> 30:55.854
[Tyler] Oh, we're rocking
the same fit?

30:58.824 --> 31:00.726
You know she said how maybe
she was allergic to nuts,

31:00.826 --> 31:03.162
allergic to chocolate, bro.
Some things you just kind of...

31:03.262 --> 31:05.097
But of course,
it's, like, vegan and stuff.

31:05.197 --> 31:06.398
Oh, really?

31:06.498 --> 31:08.000
Maybe if you would have
set up your own date

31:08.100 --> 31:09.168
you would have known.

31:09.301 --> 31:10.536
'Cause the cake
was her favorite cake.

31:10.636 --> 31:12.304
The lemonade was
her favorite lemonade.

31:12.404 --> 31:14.606
-No, I know the lemonade. Yeah.
-Oh, so you knew that.

31:14.706 --> 31:16.875
Oh, well then why are you
just jackin' on chocolate?

31:17.076 --> 31:18.010
[Lexi] Why are you doing this?

31:18.510 --> 31:20.379
You're trying to
assert dominance over a person

31:20.479 --> 31:22.081
that's supposed
to be your friend.

31:22.181 --> 31:24.850
Oh, he didn't actually--
Shut up! Shut up!

31:24.951 --> 31:26.418
What do you think, Lexi?

31:26.518 --> 31:28.354
I think he picked out
all my favorite snacks

31:28.454 --> 31:30.256
-and he did a really good job.
-Damn.

31:30.356 --> 31:31.590
I'm sorry, Luis.

31:31.723 --> 31:35.027
Yo, pack your stuff, bud.
I'm taking your bed.

31:35.127 --> 31:36.528
Those were
all my favorite snacks.

31:36.628 --> 31:39.665
He even got the restaurants
and everything correctly.

31:40.699 --> 31:42.401
Except that
it wasn't him, though.

31:42.501 --> 31:44.703
If you ask the right questions
then you know the right things,

31:44.803 --> 31:46.772
and you can get the right things
and you can do that.

31:47.773 --> 31:49.775
You're a rook.
You're learning. It's alright.

31:50.476 --> 31:51.877
That's all about it.

31:52.344 --> 31:54.613
I mean, I'm not gonna lie.
It was really cute.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.649
But I just think
Tyler isn't the smartest guy,

31:57.749 --> 32:00.452
so I know for a fact he did not
set that up by himself.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.871
Like, everybody was born
to be unique.

32:20.439 --> 32:21.507
We're happy.

32:21.607 --> 32:23.709
No, just, like,
a lot's going on right now.

32:23.809 --> 32:25.111
I thought the date
was really nice.

32:25.211 --> 32:26.912
Oh, that was so much fun.

32:28.347 --> 32:30.349
No, the group date,
we're talking about.

32:30.449 --> 32:31.550
You were there.

32:31.650 --> 32:33.619
-Yeah.
-I want a one-on-one.

32:33.719 --> 32:35.887
-I'm there, bro.
-Would you date everybody?

32:35.988 --> 32:37.589
-Huh?
-One-on-one?

32:37.689 --> 32:39.625
I want a one-on-one
with everyone.

32:39.725 --> 32:41.560
I wish that would be
a possibility.

32:41.727 --> 32:43.996
But I thought it was really
sweet what Tyler did.

32:44.530 --> 32:46.032
But Tyler didn't do that.

32:46.132 --> 32:47.699
I don't think so.

32:47.799 --> 32:49.601
No, I helped Tyler.
He came to me to help him.

32:49.701 --> 32:51.503
Why are you trying
to, like, put him under the bus?

32:51.603 --> 32:53.705
No, no, I'm not
saying that, like...

32:53.805 --> 32:55.174
Luis, bro.

32:55.274 --> 32:57.576
-What did Luis just do, bro?
-[squealing]

32:57.676 --> 33:00.012
What did Luis just do, bro?

33:00.646 --> 33:04.383
That dude is digging himself
in a hot seat right now, bro.

33:10.322 --> 33:12.224
No, I helped Tyler.
He came to me--

33:12.324 --> 33:13.925
[Lexi] Why are you trying
to, like, put him under the bus?

33:14.026 --> 33:15.827
[Luis] No, I'm not saying,
I'm not saying that, like...

33:15.927 --> 33:17.029
He's a great guy.

33:17.363 --> 33:19.598
I walk up at that table
and I'm talking to everyone

33:19.698 --> 33:23.469
and Luis starts
talking shit again.

33:23.569 --> 33:25.737
And he's like, "You know
he didn't really set that up."

33:25.837 --> 33:28.074
I'm like, "Who are you
to say that?

33:28.174 --> 33:30.376
Like, why are you,
why are you--?"

33:30.742 --> 33:33.245
I don't know
why I got so emotional.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.047
[Brian] Today was just packed.

33:35.247 --> 33:36.715
I don't know.
I think that's why.

33:36.815 --> 33:38.384
-It was a lot.
-The day's not over, babe.

33:38.484 --> 33:39.885
If it's like this
every single day, bro?

33:39.985 --> 33:41.553
It's gonna be like this
every single day.

33:41.653 --> 33:42.888
It's getting worse, guys.

33:47.293 --> 33:48.960
-I don't know.
-Don't you think?

33:49.061 --> 33:51.530
Why is everyone looking at me
like [bleep] I'm crazy?

33:51.630 --> 33:53.565
You know, I don't know anything.

33:53.665 --> 33:55.201
It's fixin' to go down.
That's what we're here for.

33:55.301 --> 33:57.836
This game gonna get spicy,
it's gonna get lit.

33:57.936 --> 34:00.005
I'm here for all the drama,
all the smoke.

34:00.172 --> 34:01.307
I'm ready for it to go down.

34:01.407 --> 34:03.742
Rylin capped on you,
I'm not gonna lie.

34:03.842 --> 34:05.277
-What did she say?
-She said that

34:05.377 --> 34:08.414
every single time
or moment that she had with him

34:08.514 --> 34:09.614
was a joke.

34:09.715 --> 34:11.217
Like, it was a joke.

34:11.317 --> 34:15.154
Like, she said she rejected you
over and over and over again.

34:15.254 --> 34:17.623
[Luis] That's hella lie,
because you were there.

34:17.723 --> 34:18.956
"He knows
that we're just friends.

34:19.056 --> 34:20.292
He knows I rejected him.

34:20.391 --> 34:22.328
Like, he even told Lexi
that I rejected him."

34:22.428 --> 34:24.263
I think it's just
a whole lot of phony shit.

34:24.362 --> 34:26.197
And no one's owning up
to what they're doing.

34:26.297 --> 34:27.966
Like, if I'm going to
do something, own up to it.

34:28.065 --> 34:29.435
You're under pressure, bro.

34:29.534 --> 34:31.937
Why is everything all of
a sudden directed towards me?

34:32.036 --> 34:35.407
It's not. You're just
sitting there taking it.

34:35.507 --> 34:37.109
[overlapping speech]

34:37.208 --> 34:38.643
[Luis] So, there is
a lot of drama.

34:38.744 --> 34:39.777
And honestly, at this point,

34:39.878 --> 34:41.147
I'm just trying to redeem myself

34:41.313 --> 34:42.947
and do whatever I can
to get on Lexi's good side.

34:43.549 --> 34:46.385
-Alright. Miss Spicy.
-Wait, I didn't hear everything.

34:46.485 --> 34:47.786
I legit have my tea.

34:47.886 --> 34:49.888
For the tea, I am ready.

34:50.322 --> 34:52.224
-Let's start spillin' it.
-Let's get into it.

34:52.324 --> 34:53.692
It's been loud.
There's been a ruckus going on.

34:53.792 --> 34:54.760
I need to be filled in.

34:54.860 --> 34:56.228
I leave you guys
for one second

34:56.328 --> 34:58.230
and all of a sudden, everybody's
screaming at each other.

34:58.330 --> 35:00.566
What are we trippin' off of?
How did the date go?

35:00.666 --> 35:03.402
The day went great.
We were just vibin', chillin'.

35:03.502 --> 35:08.240
And then I walk up and I see
nearly a reflection of myself

35:08.774 --> 35:10.008
with a blanket out.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.677
Like two pillows.
It looks really romantic.

35:11.777 --> 35:12.878
I won't lie.
It looked good.

35:12.978 --> 35:14.346
-It was a good-ass date.
-[Spicy] Okay.

35:14.546 --> 35:16.982
But the thing is, I'm like,
"Why is he being so unoriginal?

35:17.082 --> 35:18.184
Copying my fit?"

35:18.350 --> 35:20.186
And then he's getting
a one-on-one date,

35:20.286 --> 35:22.488
when he didn't even
win the challenge. You know?

35:22.588 --> 35:24.556
Like, we're over here putting in
work to win the challenge

35:24.656 --> 35:26.124
-and he gets a one-on-one.
-Kinda true.

35:26.225 --> 35:28.494
You kinda killed it.
Like, why did he get that?

35:28.594 --> 35:30.061
-Exactly.
-Okay. So, you're hatin'...

35:30.162 --> 35:31.897
It was kind of undeserved. Yeah.

35:31.997 --> 35:33.232
Okay.
And then what?

35:33.332 --> 35:34.833
Lexi and I are
on the couch, right? Listening.

35:34.933 --> 35:36.368
Okay, Lexi can hear this.

35:36.468 --> 35:39.671
And I'm figuring out over here
that it wasn't really him.

35:39.771 --> 35:41.373
Clearly, Tyler needs the help.

35:41.473 --> 35:43.442
-Okay?
-Yeah. That's what I'm saying.

35:43.542 --> 35:45.911
So, if anything, you should be
feeling sorry for him.

35:46.011 --> 35:48.280
Instead of, what came across
is jealous.

35:48.380 --> 35:49.615
What came across is hateful.

35:49.715 --> 35:51.283
It's not even
that I'm jealous or anything.

35:51.383 --> 35:54.586
I just feel that-- I feel like
he did it intentionally

35:54.686 --> 35:55.687
just to get me back.

35:55.787 --> 35:57.088
'Cause I feel really attacked,

35:57.189 --> 35:59.124
the fact that he's wearing
the same color as me...

35:59.225 --> 36:00.459
You know, the same jacket.

36:00.559 --> 36:02.361
So it's like, it's not that hard
to be yourself.

36:02.461 --> 36:04.496
I mean, imitated,
but never duplicated.

36:04.596 --> 36:07.699
-Exactly.
-So maybe take it as flattery.

36:07.799 --> 36:09.835
Because what I don't want is--

36:09.935 --> 36:12.003
fighting with other dudes
in here.

36:12.103 --> 36:13.539
Now she's, like,
"Dang, now I gotta worry about

36:13.639 --> 36:15.441
when I take him out
if he's gonna embarrass me."

36:15.541 --> 36:17.443
Like, she's paying attention
to all of this.

36:17.543 --> 36:19.177
And I know you have
the best intentions,

36:19.278 --> 36:21.880
but why are we worried
about, like, sheep

36:22.080 --> 36:23.415
when we're a freaking wolf?

36:23.515 --> 36:25.817
-No, that's real.
-That's all. Period.

36:25.917 --> 36:27.286
Yeah. That's word.

36:27.386 --> 36:29.020
But then, there's someone
capping on him,

36:29.120 --> 36:30.222
making him look terrible.

36:30.322 --> 36:32.591
-Between him and Rylin.
-Right.

36:32.691 --> 36:33.725
Making him look terrible,

36:33.825 --> 36:36.262
obviously making her
look better for Lexi.

36:36.362 --> 36:39.130
It's just like, I feel like
I'm getting attacked recently.

36:39.231 --> 36:40.599
Like everything's
directed towards me.

36:40.699 --> 36:42.834
She can play for any team
that she wants,

36:42.934 --> 36:44.102
So you guys have to remember,

36:44.436 --> 36:47.573
unless you secured the bag,
the bag's gonna get taken.

36:47.673 --> 36:50.542
So, if somebody else has to lie
on your name,

36:50.642 --> 36:52.478
what are you guys doing
to step your game up?

36:52.578 --> 36:54.045
How are you
setting yourself apart

36:54.145 --> 36:55.681
from the other people
in the house?

36:55.781 --> 36:56.982
Little by little

36:57.082 --> 36:58.250
my heart's just breaking,

36:58.350 --> 37:00.552
'cause I'm helping
other boys get my girl.

37:00.652 --> 37:02.621
We had a one-on-one
with her outside.

37:02.721 --> 37:05.090
She brought you up.
She's a little irritated.

37:05.190 --> 37:06.558
So, just go address it.

37:06.658 --> 37:08.827
Just be a man.
Own up for your actions.

37:09.227 --> 37:12.097
Make eye contact with her
and just let her know.

37:15.634 --> 37:16.768
[Spicy] Hi.

37:17.235 --> 37:18.304
I just want to say.

37:18.404 --> 37:19.705
I want to apologize
for my actions,

37:19.805 --> 37:21.673
I know I stepped out of hand
coming after Tyler.

37:21.773 --> 37:24.343
It's just that I felt like
I didn't do anything

37:24.443 --> 37:26.077
to deserve
to get called out like this.

37:26.177 --> 37:27.546
'Cause, like, you obviously seen

37:27.646 --> 37:30.048
I was wearing this
way before Tyler did.

37:30.148 --> 37:31.550
And I just feel like
that was def, like,

37:31.650 --> 37:34.620
trying to say,
"Luis, you're not it."

37:36.388 --> 37:38.824
I guess the only reason
I'm really upset

37:38.924 --> 37:40.692
is because I was so happy.

37:40.792 --> 37:43.295
I've never been on a date
like that before in my life.

37:43.395 --> 37:45.497
Nobody's ever taken the time

37:45.597 --> 37:48.099
to, like, memorize
all of my favorite snacks.

37:48.199 --> 37:49.501
And then I come inside

37:49.601 --> 37:53.038
and Luis is just, like,
being really nasty to him.

37:53.672 --> 37:56.107
Basically, I'm trying to say
I'm sorry for my actions.

37:56.207 --> 37:57.976
and I hope we can turn the page.

37:58.076 --> 38:00.646
-I don't, I don't like drama.
-Yeah.

38:00.746 --> 38:01.813
I can't handle it well.

38:01.913 --> 38:05.283
And especially after,
like, standing there.

38:05.384 --> 38:07.052
Like, this is,
like, real for me.

38:07.152 --> 38:10.589
Standing there after a really
sweet date that he put together.

38:10.689 --> 38:13.291
I was so happy.
I was, like, smiling so much.

38:13.392 --> 38:14.993
I do accept your apology.

38:15.093 --> 38:16.495
I do, I do.

38:16.595 --> 38:18.730
Like, actually, I appreciate
you coming to talk to me,

38:18.830 --> 38:22.534
because that was not--
I was just really emotional.

38:22.634 --> 38:25.203
I could tell
that Tyler was like,

38:25.737 --> 38:28.239
a really sweet
and genuine person.

38:28.340 --> 38:29.575
Sure, Cyprien might have helped.

38:29.675 --> 38:32.310
And it says loads
about Cyprien's character

38:32.411 --> 38:34.413
that he would help his friend
set that date up

38:34.513 --> 38:36.715
and not be selfish
and want to do that himself.

38:36.815 --> 38:39.985
But it's like, I had
the biggest smile on my face,

38:40.085 --> 38:41.520
and I was so happy about it.

38:41.620 --> 38:43.355
and then I come in
and it's just, like,

38:43.455 --> 38:46.492
why are we causing more drama?

38:46.592 --> 38:48.159
I'm sorry you had
to go through all that.

38:48.259 --> 38:50.028
I know you're genuinely,
like, a good person,

38:50.128 --> 38:51.363
you have a beautiful soul.

38:51.463 --> 38:54.032
The fact that your eyes
tell the whole story.

38:54.132 --> 38:55.467
You're beautiful inside out.

38:55.667 --> 38:57.335
Like, you care
about everybody.

38:57.436 --> 39:00.105
And understand that
everything here is for you.

39:00.305 --> 39:01.673
Like, we're all
trying to impress you.

39:01.773 --> 39:04.643
But I don't feel like
you're deserving any of this.

39:05.744 --> 39:06.612
I'm sorry.

39:06.712 --> 39:08.213
You're too kind
and too beautiful

39:08.313 --> 39:09.748
to be going through
any of this pain right now.

39:09.848 --> 39:11.383
Thank you.

39:12.050 --> 39:13.452
I'm sorry, boo.

39:15.954 --> 39:17.188
Thank you.

39:17.589 --> 39:19.491
[Brian] What's happening
with everyone?

39:19.591 --> 39:23.061
I'm not worried about going home
for, like, a couple days

39:23.161 --> 39:25.330
if y'all are gonna
keep fumbling.

39:25.431 --> 39:27.733
I don't think anybody's fumbling
the bag today or tomorrow.

39:27.833 --> 39:30.001
No, but he got
a lot of chances, though.

39:30.101 --> 39:31.570
You don't think?

39:31.670 --> 39:34.305
All I gotta say is, Luis [bleep]
up, but it's not only Luis.

39:34.406 --> 39:37.042
It's Luis, it's Jayme,
it's Sienna,

39:37.242 --> 39:38.444
[Marc] Luis is the scapegoat
right now.

39:38.544 --> 39:39.911
Like, literally,
they need to be called out

39:40.011 --> 39:41.112
in front of everybody.

39:41.212 --> 39:42.280
-So Lexi knows.
-That's what I'm saying.

39:42.380 --> 39:43.549
Because there's no way.

39:43.649 --> 39:44.883
I feel like--
I'm not gonna lie to you,

39:44.983 --> 39:46.752
I feel like Lexi's being
too oblivious to them.

39:46.852 --> 39:48.386
She's not even
paying them no mind.

39:48.487 --> 39:50.889
Totally. She's being sweet.
Especially to Rylin.

39:50.989 --> 39:52.924
Yeah. Exactly.

39:53.024 --> 39:55.527
Yeah, Rylin needs to be,
like, held accountable too.

39:55.627 --> 39:57.529
[Josh] Rylin just wanted
to get out of sight.

39:57.629 --> 40:00.031
She's not feelin' Luis.
They're just friends.

40:00.131 --> 40:01.399
-That's cap!
-That's cap.

40:01.500 --> 40:02.768
She cuddles up
with all her friends.

40:02.868 --> 40:04.903
And she likes physical touch
with her friends.

40:05.003 --> 40:07.639
Then, the whole thing with
Tyler and Sienna is just like...

40:07.739 --> 40:09.708
They need to figure that out.

40:09.808 --> 40:11.342
It is going down.

40:11.443 --> 40:12.978
Like, that's all we have to say.

40:13.078 --> 40:14.079
Alright, peace!

40:14.179 --> 40:16.482
-Yes.
-Hey, at eliminations...

40:16.582 --> 40:18.750
Don't let her ask no questions
who she think fake.

40:18.850 --> 40:20.452
-'Cause I'm letting it fly.
-We tellin'.

40:20.552 --> 40:22.921
-I'm lettin' it fly.
-We lettin' 'em know.

40:27.192 --> 40:28.560
Hey.

40:28.660 --> 40:31.830
Daters, welcome to your second
elimination ceremony.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.298
Just like last time,

40:33.398 --> 40:36.067
Lexi's going to swipe
on your dating profiles.

40:36.167 --> 40:38.169
And, of course,
as your matchmakers,

40:38.269 --> 40:40.572
we're gonna advocate
on your behalf.

40:40.672 --> 40:43.875
But, ultimately it's up to Lexi
whether you're going home

40:43.975 --> 40:46.612
or if you still get a chance
at love with her.

40:46.712 --> 40:50.281
So, the first profile I would
like to go through is Jasmine's.

40:50.381 --> 40:52.450
I went on a group date
with you today,

40:52.551 --> 40:55.320
and I think I connected
with you really well.

40:55.420 --> 40:58.123
Um, we talked about
some really emotional stuff

40:58.223 --> 40:59.958
and I got to know you
a lot better.

41:00.058 --> 41:02.728
Um, and I'm really glad
that that happened.

41:02.828 --> 41:06.431
For those reasons,
you will remain a match.

41:07.799 --> 41:09.635
[applause]

41:11.302 --> 41:12.838
[singing] * Butterflies!

41:12.938 --> 41:14.540
[giggles] Um.

41:15.473 --> 41:16.441
[deadpan] It was cool.

41:16.542 --> 41:17.909
I'm just kidding. No.

41:18.009 --> 41:21.279
The second person I would like
to talk about is Tyler.

41:21.580 --> 41:24.015
Tyler, um, you made
my whole day today.

41:24.115 --> 41:26.417
You really put forth
the effort

41:26.518 --> 41:29.154
and surprised me
with a really sweet date.

41:29.254 --> 41:32.023
I've never had a date like that
before in my entire life,

41:32.123 --> 41:34.092
and I want you to know
how much it meant to me.

41:34.826 --> 41:36.795
You surprised me
with all my favorite things

41:36.995 --> 41:39.497
and it was very sweet
and we talked and got deep.

41:39.598 --> 41:40.999
I really appreciated that.

41:41.099 --> 41:43.569
Um, so for those reasons,
you will remain a match.

41:43.669 --> 41:46.504
-Aw.
-[applause]

41:48.206 --> 41:50.275
My game plan in all of this

41:50.375 --> 41:52.544
is definitely taking Lexi home.

41:52.644 --> 41:54.445
I'm taking her all the way back

41:54.546 --> 41:56.748
to sweet home Alabama, baby.
You know?

41:56.848 --> 41:59.184
Up next, I would like
to talk about Luis.

41:59.284 --> 42:01.419
We've had a couple problems

42:01.519 --> 42:03.755
throughout the past
couple of days.

42:04.155 --> 42:05.757
Um, I really, really appreciated

42:05.857 --> 42:07.893
that you came
and talked to me today.

42:07.993 --> 42:10.195
Your apology was sincere
and heartfelt

42:10.295 --> 42:12.063
and it meant a lot to me.

42:12.163 --> 42:13.531
I did get really emotional today

42:13.632 --> 42:15.433
because it was
just a lot going on.

42:15.533 --> 42:17.202
and I was really
overwhelmed.

42:17.302 --> 42:19.470
So getting some reassurance
from you,

42:19.571 --> 42:22.440
and hearing your words
of apology meant a lot to me.

42:22.774 --> 42:24.576
I was still really,
really, really concerned

42:24.676 --> 42:26.311
about some of the things
that happened today.

42:26.411 --> 42:31.482
For those reasons, you will be
up for elimination tonight.

42:32.517 --> 42:33.685
So, I'm sorry.

42:33.785 --> 42:35.153
[Luis] Lexi pretty much
just called me out

42:35.253 --> 42:37.889
for some sketchy stuff
that was happening earlier.

42:37.989 --> 42:40.125
And then, I mean,
I really can't blame her.

42:40.592 --> 42:42.227
I hurt my chances really bad.

42:42.327 --> 42:44.095
The next person...

42:46.531 --> 42:48.934
Actually, could I-- Could I talk
to my dating coaches

42:49.034 --> 42:50.468
-for a second really quickly?
-Yeah.

42:50.568 --> 42:51.837
[Anthony] Sure.

42:53.705 --> 42:56.775
This is honestly so much harder
than I thought it would be.

42:57.175 --> 42:59.077
I think I already know
who I want to send home.

42:59.177 --> 43:00.145
[Anthony] Mm-hm.

43:01.279 --> 43:02.513
It's really difficult, but...

43:03.081 --> 43:05.250
I just wanna hear
some reassurance from you.

43:05.350 --> 43:06.752
What do you guys think?

43:06.852 --> 43:09.154
Literally, don't have
anyone else in mind

43:09.254 --> 43:11.923
that is up
for elimination,

43:12.023 --> 43:16.127
then it sounds like
Luis is the only one.

43:18.396 --> 43:19.397
Okay.

43:19.497 --> 43:21.366
As, you know, his coach,

43:21.566 --> 43:24.636
I've been trying
to lead and guide.

43:24.736 --> 43:26.404
and direct him
to make better decisions.

43:26.504 --> 43:29.841
But unfortunately,
he's just not there

43:29.941 --> 43:31.643
as far as, like,
the self-awareness is concerned.

43:31.743 --> 43:33.411
I think that
a lot of the negatives

43:33.511 --> 43:35.180
-outweigh the positives.
-Mm-hm.

43:35.280 --> 43:38.116
So I'm having a difficult time
finding another person

43:38.216 --> 43:40.185
to put on the elimination block.

43:40.285 --> 43:42.020
[Lexi] I really don't know
what to do at this point.

43:42.120 --> 43:43.955
On one hand I have Luis,

43:44.055 --> 43:45.456
who I feel like
I can't really trust.

43:45.657 --> 43:47.693
And on the other hand,
I have other contestants,

43:47.793 --> 43:49.861
who I feel like are
also telling half-truths.

43:53.799 --> 43:56.567
I talked to my dating coaches,

43:56.668 --> 43:59.204
I had to make a really
difficult decision tonight.

43:59.304 --> 44:00.939
I feel like there was just

44:01.039 --> 44:04.075
a lot of immaturity
and drama that happened,

44:04.175 --> 44:06.878
and as much as
I appreciated your apology,

44:06.978 --> 44:08.780
I was just
a little bit overwhelmed

44:08.880 --> 44:10.882
because of everything
that happened.

44:11.349 --> 44:12.984
So, because of those reasons,

44:13.084 --> 44:15.253
unfortunately, Luis,

44:15.787 --> 44:18.089
you have been unmatched

44:18.389 --> 44:20.225
and you will be
going home tonight.

44:21.359 --> 44:23.228
-I'm sorry.
-Don't worry about it.

44:23.528 --> 44:25.530
[Luis] It's all good.
Don't even trip.

44:26.664 --> 44:28.099
No hard feelings at all.

44:28.199 --> 44:29.534
Okay, I'm glad.

44:29.634 --> 44:31.236
And I'm really glad
we got to know each other.

44:31.336 --> 44:32.704
Just, some things
didn't work out.

44:32.804 --> 44:33.972
You know, I hope
you find happiness,

44:34.072 --> 44:35.540
and that's really
all I really care about.

44:35.640 --> 44:36.975
Thank you.

44:38.009 --> 44:39.310
[light clapping]

44:39.878 --> 44:41.279
I am okay. For the only reason

44:41.379 --> 44:43.949
because I'm not the type of guy
to be stingy like,

44:44.049 --> 44:47.418
"That should have been me.
I'm supposed to be with her."

44:47.518 --> 44:50.321
And it would have been really
nice if I did end up with her,

44:50.421 --> 44:53.524
but I am a little hurt
that we didn't.

44:53.624 --> 44:55.093
And I kind of
messed everything up,

44:55.193 --> 44:57.462
so I'm stepping on
my own shoelaces at this point.

44:57.562 --> 44:58.830
I've had a lot of fun
with you guys

44:58.930 --> 45:00.431
through this whole process.

45:00.531 --> 45:01.900
The group date
was awesome

45:02.000 --> 45:04.502
and I feel like I got to know
all of you a lot better.

45:04.602 --> 45:07.238
And I'm really excited
to continue doing that.

45:07.338 --> 45:08.239
Goodnight, guys.

45:08.539 --> 45:09.841
Get some rest.
See you tomorrow.

45:09.941 --> 45:12.010
-[Spicy] Goodnight, guys.
-[Anthony] Goodnight.

45:12.110 --> 45:14.112
-[clapping]
-[kids] Goodnight.

45:25.223 --> 45:26.257
Oh, this is hot.

45:27.092 --> 45:28.126
[giggles]

45:28.659 --> 45:31.062
Who's a big, fat, juicy liar?

45:31.462 --> 45:32.831
-[Kalysta] Rylin!
-Oh!

45:32.931 --> 45:34.399
I'm over it.
I hope she goes home.

45:34.499 --> 45:35.767
I don't want her here
anymore.

45:35.867 --> 45:38.303
He tried to kiss me
in my room the other day.

45:38.937 --> 45:41.072
And I told him that
it was not going to happen.

45:41.172 --> 45:43.074
You know what? We're throwin'
shots, let me throw this.

45:43.174 --> 45:45.110
Last night she whispered
in my boy's ear

45:45.210 --> 45:47.045
that she wanted to cuddle
with Josh last night.

45:47.145 --> 45:48.279
Is that not true?

45:48.379 --> 45:51.149
Finally someone is
honest with me about something.

45:51.249 --> 45:53.852
They dropped a bomb,
and then another bomb,

45:54.019 --> 45:55.320
and then another bomb,
and another bomb.

45:55.420 --> 45:58.356
Explosion. Shit's crazy.
