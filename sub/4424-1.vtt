My Goddamn brother is trying to
follow me to school again!

00:40.833 --> 00:42.084
Suck my balls.

00:42.209 --> 00:44.086
No, Ike, you can't come
to school with me.

00:44.211 --> 00:45.504
Yeah!
Go home, you little dildo!

00:45.629 --> 00:47.923
Dude, for the last time,
don't call my brother a dildo!

00:48.049 --> 00:50.468
All right, go home, you little
semen-puking, asshole dickhead.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.179
Ow!
- Dude, sweet.

00:53.304 --> 00:55.139
Yeah. Check it out.
Ready, Ike?

00:55.264 --> 00:56.390
Kick the baby!

00:56.515 --> 00:58.350
Don't kick the Goddamn baby.

00:58.476 --> 00:59.393
Kick the baby.
- Waah.

00:59.518 --> 01:00.728
Ow.

01:00.853 --> 01:02.229
Whoa, Cartman.

01:02.354 --> 01:03.939
Looks like you didn't get
much sleep last night.

01:04.065 --> 01:05.775
That's because I was having
these bogus nightmares

01:05.900 --> 01:06.776
all night long.

01:06.901 --> 01:07.860
Really?
What about?

01:07.985 --> 01:10.821
Well, I dreamt that I was
lying in my bed, in the dark,

01:10.946 --> 01:11.989
when all of a sudden,

01:12.114 --> 01:14.033
this bright blue light
filled the room.

01:14.158 --> 01:16.660
And slowly my bedroom door
began to open.

01:16.786 --> 01:17.870
And the next thing I remember,

01:17.995 --> 01:19.872
I was being drug
through a hallway.

01:19.997 --> 01:21.040
Weak!

01:21.165 --> 01:23.584
Then these scary aliens
wanted to operate on me.

01:23.709 --> 01:25.878
They had big heads
and big, black eyes.

01:26.003 --> 01:27.546
Dude, visitors!
- Totally!

01:27.671 --> 01:28.297
What?

01:28.422 --> 01:29.965
That wasn't a dream, Cartman!
Those were visitors!

01:30.091 --> 01:31.675
No, it was just a dream.
My mom said so.

01:31.801 --> 01:34.136
Visitors are real.
They --

01:34.261 --> 01:35.971
Wait a minute.
This has all happened before.

01:36.097 --> 01:38.265
Yeah.
This does seem really familiar.

01:38.390 --> 01:40.309
What the Funk & Wagnalls
are you talking about?

01:40.434 --> 01:42.686
Cartman, don't you remember the
last time you had this dream?

01:42.812 --> 01:45.106
Shut up, you guys.
You're just trying to scare me.

01:45.231 --> 01:46.440
No, dude, this happened before!

01:46.565 --> 01:47.650
Aliens put some device in you,

01:47.775 --> 01:49.527
and we tied you up to a tree,
and you went up on their ship.

01:49.652 --> 01:51.612
You don't remember that?
- No, I don't remember that!

01:51.737 --> 01:52.446
You don't?

01:52.571 --> 01:55.324
No, because the aliens erased
my memory!

01:55.449 --> 01:56.575
I remember this whole thing.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.285
Ike tried to follow you
to school, you kicked him,

01:58.410 --> 02:00.121
then Cartman told us
about his alien dream.

02:00.246 --> 02:01.997
Yeah, and then Chef pulled up
in his car.

02:04.125 --> 02:05.960
Hello there, children!

02:07.378 --> 02:08.629
And then you said...

02:08.754 --> 02:10.339
What's gonna be
for lunch today, Chef?

02:10.464 --> 02:13.050
Well, today it's Salisbury steak
with hot buttered noodles...

02:13.175 --> 02:15.469
...and a choice of green-
bean salad or vegetable medley.

02:15.594 --> 02:16.428
Weird.

02:16.554 --> 02:18.472
Say, did any of you children...

02:18.597 --> 02:20.641
...see the alien spaceship
last night?

02:20.766 --> 02:21.684
What the...

02:21.809 --> 02:23.310
Chef, we're in a repeat!

02:23.435 --> 02:24.270
A repeat?

02:24.395 --> 02:26.397
Cartman was visited
by aliens again last night,

02:26.522 --> 02:28.524
and now it's like we're living
a repeat of a previous day!

02:28.649 --> 02:30.067
Oh, dude, I hate repeats.

02:30.192 --> 02:32.528
I've been feeling déjà vu
all morning, children.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.697
I <i>knew</i> something strange
was going on.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.699
It all started when Cartman got
an anal probe.

02:36.824 --> 02:39.660
We have to get Eric
to a proctologist right away.

02:41.787 --> 02:44.165
What is a proc-tologist, Chef?

02:44.290 --> 02:47.084
He's a doctor that specializes
in your asshole, children.

02:47.209 --> 02:48.544
You mean at some point
in this doctor's life,

02:48.669 --> 02:50.546
he decided he wanted to work
on people's buttholes?

02:50.671 --> 02:52.298
That's right.
- What a dick.

02:52.965 --> 02:54.884
Hello, everyone.
- Hello, Doctor.

02:55.009 --> 02:56.760
Thanks for seeing Eric
on such short notice.

02:56.886 --> 02:58.345
What seems to be the problem?

02:58.470 --> 02:59.430
We just want you to take a look

02:59.555 --> 03:01.307
and tell us
if you see anything abnormal.

03:01.432 --> 03:02.892
Other than its monstrous size.

03:03.017 --> 03:06.145
Shut up, Kyle!
Shut your goddamn mouth!

03:06.270 --> 03:08.397
All right.
Let's see here.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.024
Oh my God!
- What?

03:10.149 --> 03:13.527
Why, there's a huge crack
going right down the middle!

03:14.695 --> 03:15.905
Ha ha.
Very funny.

03:16.030 --> 03:17.573
Like we haven't heard that one
a zillion times.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.617
All right.
Let's take a look.

03:20.701 --> 03:23.037
Hey! Just what the hell
do you think you're doing?

03:23.162 --> 03:25.539
Eric, the doctor has to feel
inside your rectum.

03:25.664 --> 03:28.083
Afterwards, he'll probably have
to burn his hand and bury it.

03:28.209 --> 03:30.711
Kyle, I swear, if I didn't have
a guy's hand up my ass right now,

03:30.836 --> 03:32.796
I'd leap across the room
and kick you in the nuts.

03:32.922 --> 03:35.299
Uh -- Ooh. Ehh.

03:35.424 --> 03:36.967
The prostate seems to be normal.

03:37.092 --> 03:39.303
No swelling
of the hormonal gland.

03:39.428 --> 03:41.013
Ooh.
- Oh, wait. What's this?

03:41.138 --> 03:42.431
Aah!

03:46.393 --> 03:48.020
Are you okay?
- Dude.

03:48.145 --> 03:50.814
You know that feeling
when you take a huge dump?

03:50.940 --> 03:51.857
Awesome.

03:51.982 --> 03:52.900
Well, Doctor?

03:53.025 --> 03:55.736
I've never quite seen this
before.

03:55.861 --> 03:58.155
Perhaps he just needs
some hemorrhoid cream.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.241
Aah! Aah!

04:00.366 --> 04:02.034
You all right?

04:02.159 --> 04:03.911
You know that feeling
when the huge dump you just took

04:04.036 --> 04:05.162
shoots back up inside your ass?

04:05.287 --> 04:06.163
No, I'm not all right!

04:06.288 --> 04:08.624
I've never seen a hemorrhoid
react this way.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.502
That wasn't no hemorrhoid.
It was an alien hoop-a-joop!

04:11.627 --> 04:12.586
Come on, children!

04:12.711 --> 04:14.630
We've got to get Eric
to some real help!

04:14.755 --> 04:15.714
Where to now, Chef?

04:15.839 --> 04:17.299
That thing inside Eric's asshole

04:17.424 --> 04:19.176
looked like some kind
of alien satellite dish.

04:19.301 --> 04:22.263
We need to see my friend
down at the space center now!

04:31.730 --> 04:33.190
You're the only person
I could think of

04:33.315 --> 04:34.525
who might be able
to help us, Jeff.

04:34.650 --> 04:36.735
How do we, uh, make it come out?

04:36.860 --> 04:39.321
Someone just has to activate it
like the proctologist did.

04:39.446 --> 04:40.489
Oh, no, no, no, no!

04:40.614 --> 04:43.242
Nobody is putting their finger
in my ass again.

04:43.367 --> 04:45.035
Unless it's Kyle.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.121
What? No way!
You do it, Kenny.

04:47.246 --> 04:49.248
Nope. It has to be Kyle.
- Go on.

04:49.373 --> 04:51.000
I'm not putting my finger
up Cartman's butt!

04:51.125 --> 04:53.210
Kyle, the fate of the world
may be at stake.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.838
Come, Kyle.
Do hurry.

04:59.925 --> 05:01.969
Go ahead.
It won't bite.

05:04.513 --> 05:06.265
God damn it, Cartman!

05:06.390 --> 05:09.059
I couldn't resist.
I'm sorry.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.479
Stop it, Cartman!

05:12.604 --> 05:14.356
Okay.
Okay, okay.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.943
God damn it!

05:18.068 --> 05:19.737
Oh, man, that was great.

05:19.862 --> 05:23.032
Okay, go ahead.
I'm all out of farts now.

05:24.616 --> 05:25.326
Durr!

05:25.451 --> 05:26.368
Mm!

05:26.493 --> 05:29.330
Okay, okay.
It's not funny anymore.

05:30.414 --> 05:31.582
Oh, yes, it is!

05:33.375 --> 05:34.626
Eric, that's enough!

05:34.752 --> 05:36.295
Okay, okay.

05:37.588 --> 05:40.049
Oh! Double psyche!

05:40.174 --> 05:41.633
That's it!

05:41.759 --> 05:43.802
I don't care about
the fate of the world! Screw it!

05:43.927 --> 05:44.928
Oh, nice going, Cartman!

05:45.054 --> 05:46.430
All right. All right.
I'm sorry.

05:46.555 --> 05:48.057
Go ahead, Kyle.
- No!

05:48.182 --> 05:50.059
No. Go ahead. I'm dry.
- You're lying!

05:50.184 --> 05:52.144
It stopped being funny
40 seconds ago, boys.

05:52.269 --> 05:53.645
Let's just get this over with.

05:53.771 --> 05:55.481
But it <i>was</i> one of the best times
I've ever had.

05:55.606 --> 05:57.274
Can I see this thing, please?

05:57.399 --> 05:58.567
Okay.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.861
Oh! God damn it!

06:00.986 --> 06:03.197
Okay. Now it's funny again.

06:03.322 --> 06:04.531
This is so awesome!

06:04.656 --> 06:07.034
I don't think I made it out
of that proctologist's office.

06:07.159 --> 06:08.535
I think I died
and went to heaven.

06:08.660 --> 06:10.329
That does it!
Charge!

06:10.454 --> 06:11.705
Aah!

06:16.168 --> 06:17.586
What's it doing?

06:17.711 --> 06:20.798
It -- It's sending
a transmission of some kind.

06:21.673 --> 06:22.674
Got it.

06:25.094 --> 06:27.679
It's just sending images
of cities and people and stuff.

06:27.805 --> 06:29.640
Where is the signal
being sent to?

06:31.183 --> 06:32.226
Aah!

06:33.852 --> 06:35.938
I don't want to play anymore,
you guys.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.399
We went through all that just
for some gay video of Earth?

06:38.524 --> 06:40.401
We wanted to see an alien planet
or something.

06:40.526 --> 06:42.736
Whoever they are,
if they're receiving messages,

06:42.861 --> 06:44.696
they might be sending them, too.

06:44.822 --> 06:46.782
Wait a minute.
C-Candy bars.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.158
Candy bars?

06:48.283 --> 06:49.618
You -- You know, candy bars.

06:49.743 --> 06:50.994
They usually come in a wrapper,

06:51.120 --> 06:53.205
just like you wrap
a Christmas present.

06:53.330 --> 06:55.124
Christmas happens
when it's cold.

06:55.249 --> 06:57.876
Cold, as in Alaska.
That's where the polar bears...

06:58.001 --> 07:00.379
Polar bears...
Pol -- Polarity!

07:00.504 --> 07:03.173
I can switch the polarity
to see what transmissions

07:03.298 --> 07:07.219
are coming from the location
this one is being sent to!

07:09.972 --> 07:11.557
What the heck?

07:16.812 --> 07:17.771
They're coming in!

07:24.486 --> 07:25.529
What do we do?

07:25.654 --> 07:26.655
It's that guy you want!

07:26.780 --> 07:28.657
He's trying to reverse
your polarities!

07:28.782 --> 07:29.324
What?!

07:29.450 --> 07:32.327
Aah!
Run, run, run!

07:32.453 --> 07:34.163
Get in the car, children.
Get in the car!

07:39.168 --> 07:42.045
What is that?
- Can you see anything, children?

07:42.171 --> 07:44.131
The aliens are chasing us!

07:50.762 --> 07:51.889
Goddamn aliens!

07:54.433 --> 07:55.809
Chef, end of the road!

07:57.019 --> 07:59.021
Hold on, children!
We have to ditch them!

07:59.146 --> 08:01.148
What are you doing, man?

08:03.400 --> 08:07.237
<i>Looks like them boys
are getting a little fresh air.</i>

08:13.660 --> 08:14.745
I think we ditched 'em.

08:14.870 --> 08:16.538
I don't think we're
out of the woods yet.

08:20.417 --> 08:21.460
Goot, goot!

08:21.585 --> 08:22.878
It's the police!

08:23.003 --> 08:24.171
That ain't no police!

08:30.010 --> 08:32.346
When do we get to eat?
I'm hungry.

08:32.471 --> 08:33.055
Chef!

08:33.180 --> 08:35.057
Ohh!

08:46.068 --> 08:47.903
Ha! Goddamn aliens!

08:48.028 --> 08:49.905
I beat you!

08:50.030 --> 08:53.158
Where'd you learn to drive,
aliens -- Chinese auto school?

08:53.283 --> 08:54.826
Chef!

08:54.952 --> 08:56.703
You're lucky I didn't
just turn around

08:56.828 --> 08:58.956
and beat your white, skinny
alien asses anyway!

08:59.081 --> 09:02.167
Maybe next time
you'll remember to -- Huh?

09:04.127 --> 09:05.837
Oh, crap!
Children!

09:05.963 --> 09:08.006
Chef!

09:08.131 --> 09:10.259
<i>Well, it looks like
the boys are in more trouble</i>

09:10.384 --> 09:11.927
<i>than a June bug in molasses.</i>

09:12.052 --> 09:14.054
<i>And it's pretty thick molasses,
too.</i>

09:18.892 --> 09:20.227
Uh...

09:20.352 --> 09:23.146
Ugh.
You guys, wake up!

09:23.272 --> 09:25.440
What the...
Where -- Where are we?

09:25.566 --> 09:27.818
We're in the alien ship.

09:27.943 --> 09:29.027
Aah! Aah!

09:29.152 --> 09:30.696
I'm trapped inside
Helen Hunt's ass!

09:30.821 --> 09:32.030
Oh, God!
Help me, you guys!

09:32.155 --> 09:34.408
It's not Helen Hunt's ass.
It's an alien spaceship.

09:35.158 --> 09:37.828
Oh, thank God!
Oh, thank -- thank you, Lord.

09:37.953 --> 09:39.997
You guys, look.

09:41.456 --> 09:42.624
Wow.
- Wow.

09:46.712 --> 09:48.380
Oh, my God.
Do you guys realize?

09:48.505 --> 09:51.216
This is only the second time
we've ever been in outer space.

09:51.341 --> 09:53.343
Yeah.
- Rmphm.

09:53.468 --> 09:55.721
This is like my fifth time.

10:00.183 --> 10:02.352
Uh-oh.
This must be the head alien guy.

10:02.477 --> 10:04.104
Mrph rmh!

10:05.814 --> 10:07.065
Hello, boys.

10:07.190 --> 10:08.650
Dad?

10:08.775 --> 10:09.985
No, not really.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.153
I just read your mind

10:11.278 --> 10:13.864
and thought this form might be
more pleasing to you.

10:13.989 --> 10:15.866
Oh, dude, don't do that.
That's gay.

10:15.991 --> 10:17.576
Yeah, that's like that
stupid movie <i>Contact.</i>

10:17.701 --> 10:19.119
Oh, God.
That movie pissed me off.

10:19.244 --> 10:21.663
Very well.
I shall show my true form.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.749
Blargh, blargh, blargh!
Blargh, blargh!

10:23.874 --> 10:25.751
Okay, okay! Take the form
of something else!

10:25.876 --> 10:27.377
How's this?

10:28.462 --> 10:29.212
Santa!

10:29.338 --> 10:30.505
No.
That's stupid, too.

10:30.631 --> 10:32.758
How about this?

10:32.883 --> 10:33.717
No.

10:35.093 --> 10:36.053
No.

10:38.013 --> 10:40.015
Ooh, very nice.
- No.

10:41.475 --> 10:42.976
No.

10:43.101 --> 10:45.145
Dy-no-mite!
- No.

10:47.272 --> 10:48.607
Jeff!

10:48.732 --> 10:50.692
The aliens took the children
up on their ship!

10:50.817 --> 10:51.360
Oh, no!

10:51.485 --> 10:53.111
Did you find out what
the aliens are up to?

10:53.236 --> 10:55.155
When I reversed the polarities,
I found this.

10:56.657 --> 10:58.533
It's a message that the aliens
are broadcasting

10:58.659 --> 10:59.868
throughout the entire universe.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.578
But I have no idea what it says.

11:01.703 --> 11:03.038
They took the children, Jeff!

11:03.163 --> 11:05.082
I have to know
what those aliens are up to!

11:05.207 --> 11:06.458
Wait a minute.

11:06.583 --> 11:07.709
Butt sex.

11:07.834 --> 11:09.002
Butt sex?

11:09.127 --> 11:11.505
Butt sex requires a lot
of lubrication, right?

11:11.630 --> 11:12.964
Lubrication...

11:13.090 --> 11:14.716
Lubra, chupa...

11:14.841 --> 11:17.594
Chupacabras, the -- the
goat-killer of Mexican folklore.

11:17.719 --> 11:19.304
Folklore is stories
from the past

11:19.429 --> 11:22.557
that are often fictionalized --
fictionalized to heighten drama.

11:22.683 --> 11:23.642
Drama student!

11:23.767 --> 11:25.686
Students at colleges
usually have bicycles.

11:25.811 --> 11:26.978
Bi-- Bi-- Binary!

11:27.104 --> 11:28.939
It's binary code!

11:29.064 --> 11:31.149
Who's having butt sex?

11:31.274 --> 11:33.402
♪ Hello, my honey,
hello, my baby ♪

11:33.527 --> 11:35.987
♪ Hello, my ragtime gal ♪

11:36.113 --> 11:37.239
No.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.825
♪ Let me search it,
gonna work it ♪

11:41.451 --> 11:42.202
No.

11:42.327 --> 11:44.663
♪ Don't piss on the moon, babe ♪

11:44.788 --> 11:45.414
No.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.833
All right, Earthlings. What form
do you want me to take?

11:49.668 --> 11:53.213
How about a taco
that craps ice cream?

11:57.259 --> 11:58.468
Guys?

11:58.593 --> 12:00.137
I like it.
- Mrph rmh.

12:01.430 --> 12:03.306
All right. Then we can
get back to business.

12:03.432 --> 12:05.934
Follow me this way, Earthlings.

12:08.103 --> 12:11.565
I want to apologize to you boys
for all the spooky, scary stuff.

12:11.690 --> 12:14.234
We just needed to get to
the malfunctioning uplink relay.

12:14.359 --> 12:16.319
You mean the thing in Cartman's ass?
- That's right.

12:16.445 --> 12:19.197
See, there are dishes in over
50,000 Earthlings' rectums.

12:19.322 --> 12:21.116
Your friend's
has been malfunctioning.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.534
Why do you put them
into people's asses?

12:22.659 --> 12:24.161
Are you planning some kind
of alien takeover?

12:24.286 --> 12:26.913
Oh, heavens, no!
We're a production company.

12:27.038 --> 12:28.957
We make intergalactic
television programs

12:29.082 --> 12:31.293
that the whole universe watches.

12:31.418 --> 12:32.502
Television?

12:32.627 --> 12:35.589
We at Nerzod Productions
started 20 billion years ago

12:35.714 --> 12:36.965
with one philosophy --

12:37.090 --> 12:40.135
The best universal television
isn't scripted, it's real.

12:40.260 --> 12:43.054
We started with great shows like
"Who Wants to Marry a Gelgamek?"

12:43.180 --> 12:44.931
and "Antares 6 Millionaire".

12:45.056 --> 12:46.183
And then we had a big hit

12:46.308 --> 12:48.185
with "Get Me Outta Here,
I'm a Klingnanian!"

12:48.310 --> 12:50.562
But then, of course,
there's our signature show --

12:50.687 --> 12:54.024
the greatest universal
reality show of all time.

12:58.570 --> 12:59.738
Earth?

12:59.863 --> 13:01.698
A few billion years ago,
we realized --

13:01.823 --> 13:02.866
What if we took species

13:02.991 --> 13:04.826
from all different planets
in the universe

13:04.951 --> 13:07.120
and put them together
on the same planet?

13:07.245 --> 13:08.371
Great TV, right?

13:08.497 --> 13:11.208
Asians, bears, ducks,
Jews, deer, and Hispanics

13:11.333 --> 13:13.627
all trying to live
side by side on one planet!

13:13.752 --> 13:14.753
It's great!

13:15.337 --> 13:17.547
Our planet is just
a reality-TV show?

13:17.672 --> 13:18.882
You don't think
the whole universe

13:19.007 --> 13:20.467
works the way Earth does,
do you?

13:20.592 --> 13:22.427
No!
One species, one planet.

13:22.552 --> 13:25.138
There's a planet of deer,
a planet of Asians, and so on.

13:25.263 --> 13:26.723
We put them all together
on Earth,

13:26.848 --> 13:29.434
and the whole universe tunes in
to watch the fun!

13:30.352 --> 13:32.062
You mean you aliens
actually enjoy sitting around

13:32.187 --> 13:33.647
and watching us fight
and kill each other?

13:33.772 --> 13:35.065
Dude, that's messed up.

13:35.190 --> 13:36.066
Why?
- Why?

13:36.191 --> 13:37.526
You're playing
with people's lives!

13:37.651 --> 13:39.653
You're turning people's problems
into entertainment!

13:39.778 --> 13:42.197
Yeah!
We'd never do that on Earth!

13:45.075 --> 13:46.284
Ladies and gentlemen,

13:46.409 --> 13:48.620
we have recently come across
an alien transmission

13:48.745 --> 13:51.081
that is being beamed throughout
the entire universe.

13:53.542 --> 13:55.752
When decoded,
it looks like this.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.516
What does it mean?

14:09.641 --> 14:11.101
I-It's simple mathematical
language

14:11.226 --> 14:13.186
that can be understood
throughout the solar system.

14:13.311 --> 14:16.356
Translated into our language,
it looks like this.

14:16.481 --> 14:19.025
This Jannemon at 8:00,

14:19.150 --> 14:21.695
it's everyone's
favorite show -- "Earth!"

14:21.820 --> 14:24.614
It's been 100 galgamars
since we first took species

14:24.739 --> 14:26.116
from 17 different planets

14:26.241 --> 14:28.451
and put them all together
on the same planet!

14:28.577 --> 14:30.120
Ur derp!

14:30.245 --> 14:32.205
They've fought
and fallen in love.

14:32.330 --> 14:34.082
What will happen this galgamar?

14:34.207 --> 14:36.042
Tune in Jannemon at 8:00
to find out!

14:36.167 --> 14:39.004
It's "Earth!" on FOGNL!

14:42.215 --> 14:45.760
I'm afraid that Earth --
a-all of Earth --

14:45.886 --> 14:49.431
is nothing but an intergalactic
reality-TV show.

14:51.349 --> 14:52.601
My God.

14:52.726 --> 14:53.602
We're famous!

14:57.355 --> 14:58.440
Wait.
Y-You don't understand.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.025
I'm on TV!

15:00.150 --> 15:01.234
I'm on TV!

15:01.359 --> 15:03.320
Oh, this is so awesome!

15:03.445 --> 15:04.696
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

15:04.821 --> 15:05.780
Whoo-hoo!

15:09.492 --> 15:11.745
That should get the relay
working again.

15:11.870 --> 15:13.705
All right, Earthlings.
If you'll step over this way,

15:13.830 --> 15:15.874
we'll erase your memories
and get you back to Earth.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.459
Oh, excuse me.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.002
This is Nagix.

15:19.127 --> 15:20.462
Uh-huh.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.255
Oh, no.

15:22.380 --> 15:23.757
Oh, no.
Really?

15:23.882 --> 15:25.175
And it's -- it's for sure?

15:26.343 --> 15:28.428
All right.
I'll break the news to everyone.

15:28.553 --> 15:31.056
No, no. I-I understand.
Thanks.

15:31.181 --> 15:33.558
Well, you kids can go back
to Earth if you want,

15:33.683 --> 15:35.185
but I'm afraid
it won't be there for long.

15:35.310 --> 15:36.436
The show's been canceled.

15:36.561 --> 15:37.938
What?
Who canceled us?

15:38.063 --> 15:39.272
The universal network heads.

15:39.397 --> 15:41.107
They say the Earthlings have
become aware of the show,

15:41.232 --> 15:42.275
so it won't be funny anymore.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.944
Oh, shit.
Did we do that?

15:44.069 --> 15:45.779
Everyone, can I have
your attention real quick?

15:45.904 --> 15:47.948
Uh, look, I just got a call
from the network,

15:48.073 --> 15:50.200
and I'm afraid "Earth!"
has been canceled.

15:50.325 --> 15:51.242
Aww!

15:51.368 --> 15:52.911
Now -- Now, it was a great run,

15:53.036 --> 15:55.288
and I think we should all
be really proud.

15:57.666 --> 15:58.792
Let's call in
the demolition crew

15:58.917 --> 16:00.251
to strike the Earth
for resources.

16:00.377 --> 16:02.003
Wait! Wait!
They -- They can't do this!

16:02.128 --> 16:03.421
Let us talk
to the network heads!

16:03.546 --> 16:05.590
Wouldn't do any good.
- Dude, we have to try!

16:05.715 --> 16:07.175
Please, take us to them.
Please!

16:07.300 --> 16:09.678
All right, kids. We'll take you
to the network heads.

16:09.803 --> 16:12.639
But I warn you -- Nobody has
ever gotten the executives

16:12.764 --> 16:15.308
to uncancel a show
once the call has been made.

16:15.433 --> 16:16.434
Nobody.

16:40.291 --> 16:42.252
What the hell is that?

16:42.377 --> 16:45.380
There's a huge ship of some kind
in Earth's orbit.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.298
But why?
Wait a minute.

16:47.424 --> 16:48.299
Chaos theory!

16:48.425 --> 16:49.300
Chaos theory?

16:49.426 --> 16:50.301
Chaos theory.

16:50.427 --> 16:52.303
It was first thought of
in the '60s.

16:52.429 --> 16:54.264
60 -- That's the number
of episodes

16:54.389 --> 16:56.641
they made of "Punky Brewster"
before it was canceled.

16:56.766 --> 16:58.309
Canceled?
- Huh?

16:58.435 --> 17:00.770
Don't you see?
The show is over.

17:00.895 --> 17:02.480
The aliens are canceling Earth!

17:02.605 --> 17:05.025
Oh, my God.
We have to stop them!

17:06.234 --> 17:09.946
<i>Welcome to planet FOGNL,
home of the Joozians,</i>

17:10.071 --> 17:13.658
<i>who control all media
in the universe!</i>

17:15.785 --> 17:17.287
Can I help you?

17:17.412 --> 17:20.707
Oh, uh, we have a 3:00 meeting
with the network heads.

17:20.832 --> 17:23.126
Where are you visiting from?
- Uh, Earth.

17:23.251 --> 17:25.462
Ooh!
I watch that show all the time!

17:27.088 --> 17:28.798
Oh, sure!
Come on in, Earthlings!

17:28.923 --> 17:30.633
We're just checking out
our new show.

17:30.759 --> 17:33.178
We took 100 beings
from the planet Marklar

17:33.303 --> 17:34.471
and put them on an asteroid

17:34.596 --> 17:36.473
with sentient beings
from the Horsehead Nebula.

17:36.598 --> 17:37.807
It's a riot!

17:37.932 --> 17:39.184
They hate each other!

17:42.103 --> 17:44.355
"Mighty, powerful
network executives,

17:44.481 --> 17:46.483
we have come a great distance
in order to --"

17:46.608 --> 17:48.860
Ooh, I'm starving.
You Earthlings have haglar yet?

17:48.985 --> 17:50.195
Oh, yeah.
Let's do haglar.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.571
Where do you want to go,
Meroni's?

17:51.696 --> 17:53.156
Not on a Flakmar.
Too crowded.

17:53.281 --> 17:54.991
Ooh!
Blackafelch!

17:55.116 --> 17:56.701
Oh, Blackafelch!
Perfect!

17:58.495 --> 18:00.205
This place is fantastic.

18:00.330 --> 18:02.123
Look, we just want to talk
to you about the show.

18:02.248 --> 18:04.125
Please don't cancel us.
Please.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.460
Oh, I'm sorry, Earthlings.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.046
But you have to realize,
the universe is a business.

18:08.171 --> 18:10.757
You made it to 100 episodes.
You should be proud.

18:10.882 --> 18:13.051
Yeah, a show should never go
past 100 episodes

18:13.176 --> 18:14.636
or else it starts to get stale

18:14.761 --> 18:17.806
with ridiculously stupid
plotlines and settings.

18:17.931 --> 18:21.184
Here's your order
of gespahtgaplachfenachenblah!

18:22.602 --> 18:25.396
But, sirs, we -- we think our
show is just getting good.

18:25.522 --> 18:27.398
I mean, we're just now
starting to see people

18:27.524 --> 18:29.109
get really pissed off
at each other.

18:29.234 --> 18:30.693
Oh, my God.
This is great!

18:30.819 --> 18:32.862
You must have
some Joozian ancestry.

18:32.987 --> 18:33.863
Tell us about it.

18:33.988 --> 18:35.490
There's five billion people
on our show.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.075
You can't just up
and cancel on us.

18:37.200 --> 18:40.161
Oh, my God. Will you look
at the hekmas on that joozinek?

18:40.286 --> 18:41.830
Dude, we're trying to save
our planet here!

18:41.955 --> 18:43.748
Let's take the Earthlings
to a hekma bar!

18:43.873 --> 18:44.916
Oh, yeah!

18:48.545 --> 18:50.630
Oh, yeah.
Let's see those hekmas!

18:50.755 --> 18:52.090
Sirs, uh, if you'll --

18:52.215 --> 18:54.592
Oh, man, I am so wasted.

18:54.717 --> 18:56.803
Hey, you Earthlings want to try
a little glach?

19:01.015 --> 19:03.059
Oh, yeah!

19:03.184 --> 19:04.477
Oh, gluck, yeah!

19:06.437 --> 19:07.188
Kenny!

19:07.313 --> 19:08.273
Man, screw this place!

19:08.398 --> 19:10.275
Let's go get a hotel room
and a hooker!

19:10.400 --> 19:11.276
Oh, yeah!

19:11.401 --> 19:12.277
Yeah!

19:13.945 --> 19:15.780
We have to find a way
to stop those aliens!

19:15.905 --> 19:18.158
Oh, their ship is massive!
There's no way to stop it!

19:18.283 --> 19:19.784
Wait a minute.
Jackets!

19:19.909 --> 19:20.535
Oh, no.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.579
If people don't wear jackets,
they could get cold.

19:22.704 --> 19:24.330
A cold is caused by a virus.

19:24.455 --> 19:25.331
A virus...

19:25.456 --> 19:26.791
Computer virus!

19:26.916 --> 19:28.084
We could make a computer virus

19:28.209 --> 19:30.837
and send it to their ship
to disable their computers!

19:31.713 --> 19:34.757
That doesn't make
any goddamn sense!

19:34.883 --> 19:38.094
Oh, yeah, hooker!
Oh, yeah! Yeah!

19:38.219 --> 19:40.013
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Yeah!

19:41.431 --> 19:43.183
Boy, Earthlings,
is this a party or what?

19:45.059 --> 19:47.645
Oh, that's it, baby.
You're getting my jagon hard.

19:47.770 --> 19:49.981
Yeah.
Let's party.

19:50.106 --> 19:51.941
Yes, suck my jagon.

19:52.066 --> 19:54.319
Yeah.
Now you suck on <i>my</i> jagon.

19:54.444 --> 19:57.113
Oh, yeah! Stick your finger
in my thrusher.

19:57.238 --> 19:59.032
Oh, yeah, suck it!
Suck that jagon.

20:00.283 --> 20:02.368
Dude, I have no idea
what we're seeing right now,

20:02.493 --> 20:05.330
but I have a feeling
it's really, really wrong.

20:05.455 --> 20:08.833
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!

20:10.293 --> 20:12.921
Oh, God.
My head.

20:13.046 --> 20:14.756
What did we do?

20:14.881 --> 20:17.926
Oh, man, I can't believe
I sucked your jagon.

20:18.051 --> 20:20.553
Oh, God!
We did suck each other's jagons.

20:20.678 --> 20:22.597
You kids won't tell anybody
about this, right?

20:22.722 --> 20:23.598
No.

20:23.723 --> 20:24.682
No.
Wait.

20:24.807 --> 20:27.268
We won't tell anybody
if you don't cancel our show.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.103
Ooh.
I knew that was coming.

20:29.229 --> 20:30.772
They've really got us
by the nezmins.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.315
The Earth show
can still be good.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.984
Just erase everyone's memory
so we don't know we're a show!

20:35.109 --> 20:37.070
I'm sure you'll see
that if you give our world time,

20:37.195 --> 20:39.280
it will become even more
outrageous and violent.

20:39.405 --> 20:41.199
There's even World War III
to look forward to.

20:41.324 --> 20:42.951
Then we won't have to show
anybody the picture

20:43.076 --> 20:44.452
of you guys
sucking each other's jagons.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.162
All right!
All right, Earthlings!

20:46.287 --> 20:47.413
You win.

20:47.538 --> 20:48.957
The show can stay on.

20:49.082 --> 20:50.041
All right!

20:50.166 --> 20:52.460
Just be sure to keep up the wars
and violence.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.963
Well, we've got a 5:00
with the Yurka producers.

20:55.088 --> 20:57.507
Nice meeting you, Earthlings.
Bye!

20:58.841 --> 21:00.551
Whoa, Cartman.

21:00.677 --> 21:02.178
Looks like you didn't get
much sleep last night.

21:02.303 --> 21:03.972
That's 'cause I was having
these bogus nightmares

21:04.097 --> 21:04.973
all night long.

21:05.098 --> 21:06.057
Mrph rmhmhm rm!

21:06.182 --> 21:07.600
- What the hell is that?
- Mrph rmh.

21:08.726 --> 21:10.645
Hello there, children!
- Hey, Chef.

21:10.770 --> 21:11.604
Chef, Kenny has a picture

21:11.729 --> 21:14.816
of two green things sucking
each other's shoulders.

21:15.650 --> 21:16.818
What is it, Chef?

21:16.943 --> 21:18.820
I don't know,
but something tells me

21:18.945 --> 21:20.863
this picture might be
very important, children.

21:20.989 --> 21:22.657
You should hang on to it.
