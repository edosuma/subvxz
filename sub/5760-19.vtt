<i>My name is Melinda Gordon.</i>

00:12.030 --> 00:13.030
<i>I just got married,</i>

00:13.169 --> 00:14.559
<i>just moved to a small town,</i>

00:14.693 --> 00:16.294
<i>just opened up an antique shop.</i>

00:16.860 --> 00:18.160
<i>I might be just like you.</i>

00:19.674 --> 00:21.568
<i>Except from the time that I was a little girl,</i>

00:21.569 --> 00:23.469
<i>I knew that I could talk to the dead.</i>

00:24.941 --> 00:26.091
<i>It's all right, honey.</i>

00:26.113 --> 00:28.513
<i>Earthbound spirits, my grandmother called them,</i>

00:28.543 --> 00:32.110
<i>the ones who have not crossed over because they have unfinished business with the living,</i>

00:32.110 --> 00:33.612
<i>and they come to me for help.</i>

00:35.040 --> 00:36.143
<i>To tell you my story,</i>

00:36.663 --> 00:38.017
<i>I have to tell you theirs.</i>

00:42.532 --> 00:43.684
So today,

00:43.934 --> 00:47.637
25 years after judge Walter Merrick took his oath of office,

00:48.352 --> 00:51.002
we are here to dedicate this courthouse in his name.

00:52.222 --> 00:56.122
These qualities have earned him the deep respect which he so richly deserves.

00:57.741 --> 00:59.559
So how come I've never heard of this guy?

00:59.560 --> 01:01.660
Maybe you need to be on trial more often.

01:02.498 --> 01:03.870
- You're hilarious.
- Yeah.

01:04.455 --> 01:07.400
Fair, impartial, and open-minded,

01:08.377 --> 01:10.185
a man of learning and knowledge--

01:14.382 --> 01:18.364
I've seen his name in the paper a few times. He gives lots of money to local charities.

01:18.365 --> 01:20.765
And now I'd like all of you to stand with me...

01:21.300 --> 01:22.800
On this momentous occasion...

01:25.341 --> 01:27.431
as we honor this great man.

01:36.868 --> 01:40.218
Maybe he should give some money for some new color guard uniforms.

02:00.789 --> 02:01.739
Melinda!

02:04.693 --> 02:05.785
Stop!

03:14.285 --> 03:17.285
- He's lucky you got there in time.
- He's lucky he's alive.

03:18.176 --> 03:20.726
I figured this for a heart attack or a stroke, but

03:21.106 --> 03:22.656
nothing showed up on the test?

03:23.024 --> 03:23.974
Nothing will.

03:26.808 --> 03:27.758
What did you see?

03:28.039 --> 03:28.989
A man,

03:29.257 --> 03:30.448
maybe 40 and angry.

03:31.866 --> 03:35.716
Very angry. It's like he was trying to suck the life right out of the judge.

03:35.916 --> 03:37.266
Well, he almost succeeded.

03:39.011 --> 03:41.433
Yeah, things are definitely changing out there.

03:41.880 --> 03:42.830
I heard that.

03:45.319 --> 03:46.269
What did you feel?

03:47.062 --> 03:49.312
It was almost like I was being smothered, or

03:50.348 --> 03:51.298
choking.

03:52.120 --> 03:54.981
I don't know. It's like there's more and more spirits out there that are dangerous,

03:54.982 --> 03:57.282
and they have even more power to hurt people.

03:57.959 --> 03:59.059
Maybe even kill them.

04:02.478 --> 04:05.591
Maybe this has been happening all the time. Maybe you're just seeing more now.

04:05.592 --> 04:06.542
I don't think so.

04:21.946 --> 04:22.896
Hey, Mr. Slade.

04:25.666 --> 04:26.616
Hey!

04:26.982 --> 04:31.586
I was taken advantage of! For 18 years I worked here. What did I get for it?! Nothin'!

04:31.878 --> 04:34.578
No respect! Look at me when I'm talking to you, fool!

04:36.851 --> 04:38.445
Hey! I grew up in this town.

04:39.146 --> 04:40.746
I had a future. I got a family.

04:41.122 --> 04:42.072
I got a son.

04:43.809 --> 04:47.609
You don't think I wanna be with my family? And he took it all away from me!

04:49.748 --> 04:51.256
You don't deserve this, judge Merrick!

04:51.257 --> 04:52.930
You will never see this dedication to your good name!

04:52.931 --> 04:54.311
Never! Never! Never!

04:57.789 --> 04:59.639
So why was he at the hardware store?

04:59.644 --> 05:02.132
Mike's remodeling. Sometimes it can stir things up.

05:02.133 --> 05:03.083
Oh.

05:03.116 --> 05:06.142
Remember how I was thinking we should put some new shelves in the back?

05:06.143 --> 05:07.093
Let's not.

05:07.507 --> 05:08.457
Listen to me!

05:08.920 --> 05:10.870
I lost everything! Where's my justice?

05:11.250 --> 05:13.950
Where's my justice, huh?! Where's my justice for me?!

05:13.953 --> 05:14.953
I'll be right back.

05:27.246 --> 05:28.196
You two!

05:28.374 --> 05:30.174
You two! You think you're friends?!

05:33.235 --> 05:34.335
That was a nice trip.

05:34.577 --> 05:36.114
You'd get justice, wouldn't ya?

05:36.115 --> 05:37.703
You know why? 'Cause you're white!

05:37.704 --> 05:39.330
And you, you wouldn't get nothing!

05:39.331 --> 05:41.581
No justice for you, boy! No justice for you!

05:42.313 --> 05:43.916
- Justice for what?
- Excuse me?

05:46.922 --> 05:47.872
I can help you.

05:49.908 --> 05:51.008
Wait. Wait, don't go.

05:54.061 --> 05:55.011
Too late to help!

06:00.970 --> 06:03.749
For my hardware store to compete with the big chains out on the highway,

06:03.750 --> 06:05.431
I've got to update the store, you know?

06:05.432 --> 06:07.484
- Give it a little polish.
- Your table's ready.

06:07.485 --> 06:08.985
Sell some hard-to-find items.

06:09.268 --> 06:10.968
Uh, you know, personal service...

06:11.190 --> 06:12.140
the whole deal.

06:12.637 --> 06:14.987
So how's the construction going? Any problems?

06:16.709 --> 06:20.309
Sure. Everything costs twice as much as my contractor said it would be.

06:20.755 --> 06:22.954
That's not really what I meant. I meant, uh,

06:22.955 --> 06:25.274
noises, things being moved, cold drafts.

06:25.648 --> 06:28.598
- Things that go bump in the night?
- Did anyone die there?

06:28.821 --> 06:29.871
You know about that?

06:30.049 --> 06:30.999
No, not really.

06:31.041 --> 06:34.498
I'm just trying to learn everything I can about the town, good and bad.

06:34.499 --> 06:37.976
Yeah, it was back when my dad had the store. 1974 or '75.

06:38.917 --> 06:40.765
Yeah, one of the employees got killed.

06:40.766 --> 06:41.716
In the store?

06:42.594 --> 06:44.825
No, I don't think so. Why?

06:45.331 --> 06:47.531
You think I might have ghosts or something?

06:49.377 --> 06:52.945
No. Um, I just have a very morbid curiosity.

07:05.895 --> 07:08.903
You ever notice how people will shop like crazy in a pouring rain,

07:08.904 --> 07:11.403
but one clap of thunder and they scurry home like roaches?

07:11.404 --> 07:12.995
Hmm. Roaches. Nice visual.

07:13.522 --> 07:14.462
I liked it.

07:14.773 --> 07:16.372
And where is the rain, by the way?

07:16.373 --> 07:19.316
It's been thundering for, like 2 hours and not a cloud in the sky.

07:19.317 --> 07:20.270
Here, this is him.

07:20.736 --> 07:25.135
Ely Fisher attacked a white co-worker, Link Hofstadter, when he insulted him.

07:25.764 --> 07:27.764
Ooh. Must have been one serious insult.

07:28.637 --> 07:31.503
Then Link killed him, but no charges were ever filed.

07:31.822 --> 07:33.672
Why does that sound backwards to me?

07:33.685 --> 07:36.085
They were saying there was rumblings of racism.

07:37.000 --> 07:37.950
You think?

07:38.576 --> 07:40.035
What? It was almost 30 years ago.

07:40.036 --> 07:43.686
It's hard to imagine that people still think like that, especially here.

07:43.800 --> 07:45.600
Did I ever tell you my vodka story?

07:45.774 --> 07:46.724
No.

07:47.406 --> 07:49.752
I was in this liquor store looking for a good bottle of wine,

07:49.753 --> 07:52.017
but they didn't have a really good selection. So I'm leaving,

07:52.018 --> 07:54.568
behind this pretty blonde, and the alarm goes off.

07:54.816 --> 07:57.416
And then the security guard practically tackles me.

07:57.544 --> 07:59.294
They thought you were shoplifting?

07:59.751 --> 08:02.250
The blonde had put a bottle of vodka under her coat.

08:02.251 --> 08:04.831
And she didn't know there was a sensor on it, but--

08:04.832 --> 08:06.740
well, I was the one that they saw.

08:09.302 --> 08:12.233
I didn't think stuff like that still happened, at least not in the city.

08:12.234 --> 08:13.384
It wasn't in the city.

08:13.505 --> 08:15.605
Melinda, it was right here in Grand View.

08:16.266 --> 08:17.416
You see things I don't

08:18.084 --> 08:19.034
and vice-versa.

08:19.377 --> 08:21.687
Yeah, but most people in this town are not like that.

08:21.688 --> 08:23.288
Well, I don't know all of them.

08:24.215 --> 08:25.965
I didn't know any of them in 1975.

08:26.756 --> 08:27.906
What else does it say?

08:28.276 --> 08:30.451
Ely, he had a wife and a young son.

08:30.995 --> 08:32.087
Oh! Wait.

08:33.639 --> 08:34.946
Wow. Judge Merrick.

08:35.597 --> 08:38.660
Yeah, he was the prosecuting attorney. He was also the one who

08:38.662 --> 08:40.361
didn't file charges against Link.

08:40.703 --> 08:42.179
So why is Ely suddenly back?

08:42.970 --> 08:46.270
I don't think he's too happy that judge Merrick is being honored.

08:47.811 --> 08:51.811
All right. I'm ready to do the whole "scurry and roach" thing myself right now.

08:57.654 --> 09:00.104
- See you tomorrow.
- Have fun.
- Ok, thanks. Bye.

09:33.460 --> 09:35.662
- Really, go ahead and eat.
- No, I'll wait.

09:36.700 --> 09:37.653
Lasagna.

09:38.263 --> 09:40.317
Tastes better when it's reheated anyway.

09:40.358 --> 09:41.608
I'll be home in an hour.

09:41.814 --> 09:43.717
You sound a little funny. What's going on?

09:43.718 --> 09:44.724
I'll explain later.

09:45.163 --> 09:47.829
Look, the weather stinks. Do you have to go see this judge tonight?

09:47.830 --> 09:48.830
Yeah, I think I do.

09:49.084 --> 09:50.582
Listen, do you know anybody at the courthouse

09:50.583 --> 09:53.251
that might know where the Fisher's moved after Ely died?

09:53.252 --> 09:55.072
- Well, that depends.
- On what?

09:55.466 --> 09:58.016
On whether or not you really come home in an hour.

10:00.109 --> 10:01.588
9:02. Set your watch.

10:03.222 --> 10:04.172
Check.

10:04.808 --> 10:05.758
Drive safe, babe.

10:06.099 --> 10:07.049
Bye.

10:50.904 --> 10:51.854
Stop it!

11:14.150 --> 11:16.100
- Thank you.
- I'll check on you later.

11:17.488 --> 11:21.838
The nurse said someone's coming to repair the monitor. I can stay until they get here.

11:22.588 --> 11:23.938
2 close calls in one week.

11:24.976 --> 11:26.506
This is getting to be a habit.

11:26.507 --> 11:27.907
Is there anything I can do?

11:28.774 --> 11:31.267
I think saving my life was enough for one night.

11:33.599 --> 11:35.549
You were at the ceremony, weren't you?

11:37.621 --> 11:40.271
Um, is there anyone I can get in touch with for you?

11:40.514 --> 11:42.321
No. My wife passed a few years ago.

11:43.639 --> 11:45.339
Haven't seen my brother in years.

11:46.420 --> 11:47.586
Now, if i die...

11:49.034 --> 11:52.084
I'm sure there would be a few people happy to get that call.

11:53.611 --> 11:54.707
People you sent to jail?

11:54.708 --> 11:56.308
Most of them are still in jail.

11:57.106 --> 11:58.179
My sentences stuck.

11:58.909 --> 11:59.959
I was proud of that.

12:00.154 --> 12:01.104
Ely Fisher?

12:02.282 --> 12:03.217
Beg your pardon?

12:03.218 --> 12:06.367
He died in 1975. You were a prosecutor then.

12:07.285 --> 12:08.489
1975?

12:09.652 --> 12:14.302
Sweetie, I can barely remember what I had for breakfast this morning much less 30 years ago.

12:15.208 --> 12:18.458
This is gonna sound strange, but I think you might be in danger.

12:18.570 --> 12:19.520
Please.

12:20.214 --> 12:22.393
The only danger I face is my cholesterol.

12:24.059 --> 12:25.009
And I'm...

12:25.275 --> 12:26.675
getting a little tired now.

12:28.033 --> 12:28.983
Of course.

12:29.513 --> 12:31.263
Maybe I'll come back another time.

12:33.149 --> 12:34.749
Mr. Merrick, are you all right?

12:35.694 --> 12:36.644
I'm all right.

12:59.048 --> 13:00.448
Your father was Ely Fisher.

13:02.169 --> 13:04.474
He worked at the hardware store in Grand View.

13:04.475 --> 13:06.925
- Who wants to know?
- My name is Melinda Gordon.

13:08.419 --> 13:09.997
How'd you get this number, lady?

13:09.998 --> 13:10.811
Dad, you said you'd--

13:10.812 --> 13:12.586
- just hold on!
- One second, buddy.

13:12.587 --> 13:16.337
My husband works for the county, and he looked up some courthouse records.

13:17.056 --> 13:17.998
Courthouse?

13:17.999 --> 13:19.510
Yeah. I'm doing some research,

13:19.511 --> 13:22.291
and I was wondering if we could discuss it. I could come to Martinsville.

13:22.292 --> 13:23.492
What do you want, lady?

13:23.598 --> 13:25.248
- Daddy, come on.
- Hush, Jameel.

13:26.263 --> 13:27.835
Walter Merrick. Do you know him?

13:27.836 --> 13:29.239
Yeah, I know Merrick.

13:30.212 --> 13:32.612
He's the man who killed my mother when I was 7.

13:33.735 --> 13:34.685
Your mother...

13:35.001 --> 13:36.890
I'm sorry. I knew that your father had died.

13:36.891 --> 13:38.241
My father didn't just die.

13:39.326 --> 13:40.526
My father was murdered.

13:46.782 --> 13:47.782
I can't believe it.

13:48.339 --> 13:52.339
I lose my father, my mother, and judge Merrick gets a building named after him.

13:55.409 --> 13:56.359
What am I sayin'?

13:56.746 --> 13:58.146
Of course I can believe it.

13:58.349 --> 14:00.199
You said he killed your mother. How?

14:01.282 --> 14:02.232
Do I know you...

14:02.958 --> 14:03.908
or what you want?

14:04.486 --> 14:05.856
Why should I tell you anything?

14:05.857 --> 14:07.119
You came here, didn't you?

14:07.120 --> 14:08.620
I came to visit my aunt Rose.

14:08.700 --> 14:11.383
Well, I think there's more to the story than what's in the newspaper.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.934
A white man killed my father and got away with it.

14:13.951 --> 14:14.901
That's the story.

14:15.179 --> 14:16.379
Come on, dad. Let's go.

14:16.679 --> 14:17.629
Look, I'm sorry,

14:18.038 --> 14:19.238
ok? I didn't mean to...

14:20.148 --> 14:21.448
to upset you or your dad.

14:22.398 --> 14:24.098
I just want to help, both of you.

14:24.112 --> 14:25.062
Help?

14:25.135 --> 14:26.535
How are you gonna help him?

14:29.993 --> 14:30.943
Come here.

14:31.458 --> 14:33.358
Look, you see that store right there?

14:34.103 --> 14:35.953
That's where your granddaddy worked.

14:36.244 --> 14:37.594
See that alley down there?

14:38.087 --> 14:39.187
That's where he died.

14:39.718 --> 14:42.754
Your grandfather worked in that hardware store for 18 years.

14:42.755 --> 14:45.677
And then Mr. Slade hired that punk Link Hofstadter.

14:45.964 --> 14:48.253
I don't need to be treated this way, not by any man.

14:48.264 --> 14:50.254
Ely. Ely, wait. It's the only fair way.

14:50.357 --> 14:53.652
With all due respect, Mr. Slade. I've come to work on time for 18 years.

14:53.653 --> 14:54.903
Never took one sick day.

14:55.453 --> 14:58.130
And you're gonna start him at a dollar more an hour than you pay me?

14:58.131 --> 14:59.081
How is that fair?

14:59.349 --> 15:01.710
You think I'd work for less than some colored man?

15:01.711 --> 15:03.988
His father, I owe him a favor.

15:04.136 --> 15:05.086
Oh, yeah, I know.

15:05.406 --> 15:08.006
Everybody around here owes the Hofstadters a favor.

15:08.047 --> 15:11.032
And this one can't tell the difference between a lamp shade an a light socket.

15:11.033 --> 15:12.633
Hey! You watch your mouth, boy!

15:20.152 --> 15:21.102
And that night...

15:21.496 --> 15:22.446
that night,

15:22.600 --> 15:23.600
Link waited on him,

15:24.133 --> 15:26.183
jumped him and killed him in cold blood.

15:26.742 --> 15:27.692
Dad, my hand.

15:33.911 --> 15:35.711
Link said that it was self-defense.

15:35.733 --> 15:39.283
- And the newspapers, they say--
- The Hofstadters own the newspapers.

15:39.716 --> 15:42.966
And they own half the mortgages on the properties in Grand View.

15:43.067 --> 15:44.283
But there were no witnesses.

15:44.284 --> 15:45.734
I heard there was a witness,

15:46.123 --> 15:48.823
and the Hofstadters paid them off, whoever they were.

15:48.887 --> 15:49.887
Is there any proof?

15:50.082 --> 15:51.632
That's just what Merrick said,

15:52.464 --> 15:55.015
the man whose name is on that plaque back there.

15:55.365 --> 15:56.663
Go away! Get lost!

16:00.791 --> 16:02.591
I was about the same age as Jameel.

16:02.613 --> 16:06.263
And my mother couldn't believe that Merrick was not gonna press charges.

16:07.938 --> 16:09.888
My mother wasn't gonna just let it go.

16:10.279 --> 16:11.279
She wanted justice.

16:11.570 --> 16:13.841
But judge Merrick told her there were no witnesses

16:13.842 --> 16:15.942
and that it was Link's word against hers.

16:15.944 --> 16:16.894
But she knew.

16:17.708 --> 16:19.608
Your husband threatened to kill Link.

16:19.875 --> 16:20.955
There was a witness!

16:21.751 --> 16:23.951
She knew my father would never hurt anyone.

16:24.693 --> 16:25.743
It was self-defense.

16:25.925 --> 16:28.942
At least put it in front of a grand jury. Let them decide.

16:31.873 --> 16:33.123
My mother died that day.

16:34.465 --> 16:37.043
They said it was a heart attack. And I guess they were right.

16:37.044 --> 16:38.694
'Cause her heart broke that day.

16:39.441 --> 16:40.391
That's a

16:40.724 --> 16:42.811
horrible thing for a 7-year-old to see.

16:43.506 --> 16:45.256
Do you think I want your sympathy?

16:46.930 --> 16:48.580
Do you know what became of Link?

16:48.581 --> 16:50.381
Yeah, I kept track of that bastard.

16:51.407 --> 16:53.707
He got sick a couple of years ago and died...

16:54.082 --> 16:55.582
in the comfort of his home...

16:55.798 --> 16:58.087
surrounded by his wife and kids.

17:02.515 --> 17:03.465
Get outta here!

17:04.193 --> 17:05.143
Come on!

17:08.401 --> 17:11.151
You know what's weird? Ely never showed himself today.

17:11.857 --> 17:13.107
Maybe he's all gone now.

17:13.820 --> 17:16.371
That's what I love about you: Forever an optimist.

17:16.839 --> 17:21.190
It was more like standing on that square, you could see Ely's anger on his son's face.

17:21.479 --> 17:23.710
They make the same expressions when they're mad...

17:23.711 --> 17:24.960
which is all the time.

17:26.310 --> 17:28.060
Well, the man's father was killed,

17:28.272 --> 17:29.573
probably in a hate crime.

17:29.864 --> 17:30.984
Nothing was done.

17:31.505 --> 17:32.455
That would

17:32.843 --> 17:34.632
pretty much make me mad all the time.

17:34.633 --> 17:36.083
I get it. I do. It's just...

17:37.091 --> 17:40.208
so sad to see such an angry little boy,

17:41.161 --> 17:43.477
that hatred passed down from father to son.

17:44.324 --> 17:46.224
That's the way of the world, my love.

17:46.423 --> 17:47.373
Always has been.

17:49.481 --> 17:51.481
You know, maybe if I get them together,

17:52.227 --> 17:55.477
the judge could tell Randall what happened and break they cycle.

17:56.030 --> 17:56.980
Right.

17:57.184 --> 18:00.393
And then they could get started on that pesky little gaza strip thing.

18:00.394 --> 18:01.344
I'm serious.

18:02.449 --> 18:05.110
There's a reason I am pulled into these people's lives.

18:05.111 --> 18:06.263
I know, I know.

18:07.746 --> 18:09.446
Some things are beyond your help,

18:09.804 --> 18:10.754
anybody's help.

18:11.226 --> 18:12.176
Some people,

18:12.700 --> 18:15.000
all they wanna do is hold on to their hatred.

18:17.643 --> 18:19.293
Well, I won't know unless I try.

18:20.540 --> 18:21.490
Wait.

18:21.624 --> 18:22.574
You mean now?

18:23.065 --> 18:24.465
Yeah. I can't sleep anyway.

18:26.225 --> 18:27.275
I'm coming with you.

18:27.298 --> 18:28.748
No. You might scare him off.

18:29.082 --> 18:31.295
He does not sound like a guy who scares easy.

18:31.296 --> 18:33.096
Please? There's nothing you can do.

18:34.193 --> 18:35.265
Wait. What are you saying?

18:35.266 --> 18:38.004
I'm supposed to wait here while you go out in this weather looking for this...

18:38.005 --> 18:38.833
whatever he is?

18:38.834 --> 18:39.848
No. Don't wait.

18:40.628 --> 18:42.328
Get some rest. I'll be home soon.

19:02.029 --> 19:02.979
Who are you?

19:13.145 --> 19:14.095
What do you want?!

19:14.420 --> 19:15.720
What have I done to you?!

19:19.998 --> 19:21.448
I know what happened to you,

19:21.890 --> 19:23.240
to your wife and your son.

19:24.408 --> 19:25.358
What about my son?

19:25.595 --> 19:26.545
He's in pain.

19:27.042 --> 19:28.344
He's filled with hatred.

19:28.759 --> 19:29.587
He should be.

19:29.588 --> 19:30.538
No,

19:30.643 --> 19:32.643
you're wrong. It's gonna ruin his life.

19:34.198 --> 19:35.858
Look, I can help you talk to the judge--

19:35.859 --> 19:37.797
I'll talk to him when he's dead like me,

19:37.798 --> 19:38.935
and that's what I'll make him

19:38.936 --> 19:42.219
before he ever gets a chance to see that dedication to his good name.

19:42.220 --> 19:43.979
Don't do this. There's a better way.

19:43.980 --> 19:44.930
I'm taking him!

19:45.267 --> 19:46.417
You better stand back,

19:46.794 --> 19:48.394
or I may have to take you, too.

19:48.872 --> 19:51.822
There are people over here who are very interested in you.

19:54.665 --> 19:55.815
Hey, it's ok. It's ok.

19:57.102 --> 19:58.052
Don't be mad.

20:05.243 --> 20:07.043
I spent a lot of time on that case.

20:08.014 --> 20:09.426
Interviewed dozens of people.

20:09.427 --> 20:12.477
I was a brand-new prosecutor, and I wanted to make my bones.

20:14.091 --> 20:17.501
The Hofstadters are very powerful. Is that why you decided not to prosecute?

20:17.502 --> 20:18.452
No.

20:18.600 --> 20:20.300
If ambition were my only concern,

20:20.419 --> 20:24.119
a murder trial would have been the best way to get my name in the papers.

20:24.631 --> 20:26.481
Everything isn't in black and white.

20:26.975 --> 20:28.425
Interesting choice of words.

20:29.105 --> 20:30.505
No, I knew Link Hofstadter.

20:31.139 --> 20:33.339
I knew his family. He was a fine young man.

20:34.519 --> 20:37.019
You want to know what really happened that night?

20:38.627 --> 20:41.143
I come to work on time for 18 years, damn you,

20:41.299 --> 20:44.233
took crap from customers who let me carry their refrigerator to the damn door

20:44.234 --> 20:46.344
and then got nervous when I took it inside.

20:46.345 --> 20:49.045
Customers who made me put their change on the counter

20:49.045 --> 20:50.799
so we wouldn't accidentally touch hands.

20:50.800 --> 20:53.150
But I took it. Oh, I smiled. I said thank you,

20:53.189 --> 20:55.602
and you're paying him a dollar more an hour than you pay me?

20:55.603 --> 20:58.055
His father, I owe him a favor.

20:58.156 --> 20:59.106
A dollar more!

20:59.570 --> 21:02.798
And this meathead can't tell the difference between a lampshade and a light socket.

21:02.799 --> 21:04.149
I'd watch your mouth, boy.

21:04.598 --> 21:07.048
Don't you ever call me boy. You dumbass cracker.

21:07.593 --> 21:09.674
- Just stop it.
- Call me boy again, you're dead!

21:09.675 --> 21:11.025
That's enough. We're okay.

21:11.788 --> 21:13.758
I won't have this. Not in my store.

21:14.030 --> 21:15.841
One more fight, I fire you both.

21:21.353 --> 21:23.160
That night, Ely waited for him.

21:25.387 --> 21:28.387
Ely could take care of himself. He was good with his fists.

21:29.446 --> 21:30.396
Hey, boy,

21:31.534 --> 21:32.784
I got somethin' for you.

21:32.993 --> 21:33.874
Come on.

21:33.875 --> 21:34.916
Come on, cracker.

21:35.809 --> 21:36.909
Show me what you got.

21:37.297 --> 21:39.357
Come on. Come on.

21:39.822 --> 21:40.624
Come on, cracker!

21:40.625 --> 21:41.641
Come on, show me what you got.

21:41.642 --> 21:43.242
I'm not losing my job over you.

21:43.596 --> 21:44.546
Come on.

21:52.632 --> 21:53.582
Come on, boy.

21:54.557 --> 21:55.587
Come on, boy.

21:59.664 --> 22:00.614
Come on.

22:16.020 --> 22:17.570
It was a case of self-defense.

22:19.928 --> 22:22.228
How do you know that? You weren't even there.

22:22.270 --> 22:26.320
I took statements from the people who saw the two of them arguing in the street.

22:26.881 --> 22:29.136
The medical reports backed up everything Link said.

22:29.137 --> 22:31.987
I came to this very hospital to question him that night.

22:32.277 --> 22:33.759
He had two broken ribs,

22:35.008 --> 22:37.687
and he needed 19 stitches to close up his cheek.

22:38.471 --> 22:39.421
And Ely?

22:40.047 --> 22:42.197
The blow to his head killed him instantly.

22:42.358 --> 22:43.908
Link was all torn up about it.

22:44.488 --> 22:46.138
I doubt he ever forgave himself.

22:46.332 --> 22:48.082
There were rumors about a witness.

22:48.208 --> 22:51.658
Oh, I knew about the rumors. They were never substantiated. Not one.

22:52.894 --> 22:54.986
Why are you digging all this up? Why now?

22:54.987 --> 22:57.878
Ely's family feels like there was an injustice done.

22:58.205 --> 22:59.155
I'm sure they do.

23:00.455 --> 23:04.005
It was a tragedy from every side. But you can't bring criminal charges

23:04.840 --> 23:06.627
against a man, ruin his good name,

23:06.730 --> 23:09.180
maybe taint him for life, for defending himself.

23:19.161 --> 23:20.618
Daddy, why are you crying?

23:22.237 --> 23:23.337
Look, I'm not crying.

23:24.310 --> 23:26.760
It's just the wind. It blew something in my eye.

23:27.201 --> 23:28.751
It's real windy in the square.

23:29.886 --> 23:31.786
Then why are we sitting here so long?

23:33.294 --> 23:34.244
Maybe...

23:35.560 --> 23:36.510
I don't know.

23:38.056 --> 23:39.656
Makes me feel closer to my dad.

23:40.452 --> 23:41.752
I feel a little mixed up.

23:43.739 --> 23:44.689
Come on, let's go.

23:45.322 --> 23:47.172
But daddy, you told me never to cry.

23:47.393 --> 23:50.443
Yeah, that's right. Don't you ever let anybody make you cry.

23:52.313 --> 23:53.820
You only trust your own kind.

23:55.519 --> 23:56.919
That's how you stay strong.

23:57.986 --> 23:59.336
That's how you stay ready.

23:59.834 --> 24:00.784
Ready for what?

24:02.835 --> 24:04.235
Ready for places like this.

24:06.906 --> 24:09.106
- He looks just like in the pictures.
- Who?

24:12.283 --> 24:14.083
What are you talking about, Jameel?

24:15.197 --> 24:16.147
Grandpa.

24:21.624 --> 24:22.574
Come on, let's go.

24:23.521 --> 24:24.471
But, dad,

24:24.481 --> 24:26.281
he's standing right there. I swear.

24:33.923 --> 24:35.651
I think I'm getting carpal tunnel syndrome.

24:35.652 --> 24:38.051
No way, our insurance doesn't cov...

24:39.282 --> 24:40.544
the boy, he can see me.

24:44.709 --> 24:46.209
Lots of kids can see spirits.

24:47.386 --> 24:48.536
Are you talking to me?

24:50.385 --> 24:53.285
Okay, should I get ready to run screaming from the store?

24:53.722 --> 24:55.422
I'll get back to you on that one.

24:58.229 --> 25:00.629
- How come he can see me?
- I don't really know.

25:00.957 --> 25:03.301
They usually grow out of it by the time they're eight or nine.

25:03.302 --> 25:05.493
When they realize they're not supposed to be seeing them.

25:05.494 --> 25:07.094
Your grandson's seven, I think.

25:07.589 --> 25:09.139
So why didn't you talk to him?

25:09.776 --> 25:11.076
I don't know what to say.

25:12.098 --> 25:13.048
Yes, you do.

25:14.589 --> 25:17.839
Wait, hey, oh, no. Are you gonna leave me here alone with the...

25:22.030 --> 25:22.980
All right.

25:25.518 --> 25:27.018
I'll be in the back if, uh...

25:27.847 --> 25:28.797
if you need me.

25:37.043 --> 25:37.993
Hi.

25:39.316 --> 25:41.816
There's something I need to show you in my store.

25:49.835 --> 25:51.185
Where are we going, daddy?

25:51.262 --> 25:52.362
Don't worry about it.

25:54.463 --> 25:56.977
- What's your name?
- Jameel. Jameel Fisher.

25:58.533 --> 25:59.633
Mm-hmm, second grade.

26:00.822 --> 26:01.872
Who's he talking to?

26:02.224 --> 26:03.324
What's going on here?

26:04.402 --> 26:05.952
The other night when I called,

26:06.195 --> 26:08.045
it's because I had seen your father.

26:08.563 --> 26:10.278
What're you talking about? My father's dead.

26:10.279 --> 26:12.262
Your dad, he can't see me, can he?

26:12.911 --> 26:14.211
No, just me and the lady.

26:14.642 --> 26:16.392
What're you, some kind of grifter?

26:16.666 --> 26:18.816
What, you're gonna tell me my future next?

26:19.335 --> 26:20.535
Look, I have this gift.

26:20.640 --> 26:21.840
Do you still live here?

26:23.124 --> 26:25.069
No, but I did.

26:26.715 --> 26:27.665
All my life.

26:27.843 --> 26:30.574
I was born in the same house your aunt Rose lives in now.

26:30.575 --> 26:32.506
Wait a minute, you were born in a house?

26:32.507 --> 26:33.457
What?

26:33.624 --> 26:36.387
Back then, lots of people were. Couldn't afford the hospitals.

26:36.388 --> 26:39.788
Granddaddy was born in a house, not a hospital. They were too poor.

26:42.306 --> 26:44.106
- How are you doing this?
- I'm not.

26:45.972 --> 26:47.122
Me and your aunt Rose,

26:47.612 --> 26:50.017
we slept in a dresser drawer when we were babies.

26:50.018 --> 26:52.568
Then Celia came along, they finally bought a crib.

26:53.009 --> 26:53.959
Who's Celia?

26:54.813 --> 26:55.763
Celia.

26:57.233 --> 26:59.483
She passed when she was just a little thing.

26:59.528 --> 27:01.000
She drowned down

27:01.078 --> 27:02.028
in a pond.

27:02.639 --> 27:04.389
I was supposed to be watching her.

27:04.539 --> 27:07.721
Daddy, is that why you won't let me go swimming unless you watch?

27:07.722 --> 27:09.772
'Cause granddaddy wasn't watching Celia?

27:09.872 --> 27:11.122
All right, what is this?

27:11.527 --> 27:14.144
Only me and my family knows that story.

27:14.983 --> 27:15.933
Your father knows.

27:16.227 --> 27:17.177
My father.

27:17.488 --> 27:18.438
He's here.

27:18.554 --> 27:19.504
He is, daddy.

27:21.376 --> 27:22.326
All right,

27:23.990 --> 27:24.990
if granddad's here,

27:26.175 --> 27:27.875
ask him what happened that night.

27:32.514 --> 27:35.012
It's not like what Link Hofstadter said.

27:36.229 --> 27:37.329
Came out of the barn,

27:37.354 --> 27:39.254
and I could smell the alcohol on him.

27:39.897 --> 27:40.847
Hey, sambo.

27:42.369 --> 27:43.077
Come here.

27:43.078 --> 27:44.328
I got something for you.

27:44.383 --> 27:45.333
Mr. Hofstadter,

27:45.652 --> 27:48.159
I didn't mean nothing about what I said at the store today.

27:48.160 --> 27:50.328
Come on, boy, show me some of your sass now!

27:50.329 --> 27:51.929
I'm not losing my job over you.

28:10.687 --> 28:11.941
I heard his ribs crack.

28:12.707 --> 28:16.307
But he wasn't gonna let me win. What would he tell his redneck friends?

28:27.748 --> 28:29.048
It wasn't like Link said.

28:29.968 --> 28:32.698
I was just going to get some milk for your daddy's breakfast.

28:32.699 --> 28:34.949
My daddy gives me milk for my breakfast too.

28:37.309 --> 28:38.859
He wasn't looking for a fight.

28:38.946 --> 28:40.196
That's what my mom said.

28:41.341 --> 28:42.391
Nobody would listen.

28:44.084 --> 28:45.952
She cried, she cried,

28:46.442 --> 28:47.392
she couldn't work.

28:48.097 --> 28:49.213
She lost her job.

28:49.580 --> 28:52.453
I just wanted a way to make them pay, Link and that prosecutor.

28:52.454 --> 28:54.354
He wanted to punish Link and Merrick.

28:54.363 --> 28:55.313
Well, wait,

28:56.927 --> 28:58.000
if he's still here,

28:59.334 --> 29:00.384
after all this time,

29:01.608 --> 29:03.158
how come he didn't talk to me?

29:03.986 --> 29:06.319
I was the same age as Jameel is right now.

29:07.141 --> 29:08.291
I didn't know I could.

29:09.084 --> 29:11.196
I was just trying to make them pay.

29:11.976 --> 29:15.126
You know what it would've meant, pop? If I could just see you?

29:15.442 --> 29:17.142
To just know that you were there.

29:18.249 --> 29:21.307
Teach me the things that a father is supposed to teach his son.

29:21.308 --> 29:22.758
It's not like that, Randall.

29:23.202 --> 29:24.952
He just didn't know that he could.

29:25.802 --> 29:26.752
What about mom?

29:27.768 --> 29:29.268
Where were you when she died?

29:30.470 --> 29:31.497
And where is she?

29:31.951 --> 29:32.814
Tell him

29:32.815 --> 29:33.958
I was there that day.

29:35.569 --> 29:36.719
Rachel saw this light,

29:37.062 --> 29:40.187
she wanted me to come with her, but I couldn't, I just couldn't.

29:40.188 --> 29:41.488
Your mother crossed over.

29:42.438 --> 29:44.582
And your father couldn't because he was too angry.

29:44.583 --> 29:46.283
Well, I know all about the anger.

29:46.430 --> 29:48.480
All right, 'cause that's all he left me.

29:49.830 --> 29:51.230
What good has he done, huh?

30:07.413 --> 30:08.363
Wait!

30:10.818 --> 30:12.389
Back there you asked me where he was

30:12.390 --> 30:15.890
when you needed him to teach you the things fathers teach their sons.

30:16.684 --> 30:19.184
There are some things you need to teach your son.

30:19.229 --> 30:21.601
Maybe even some things you need to teach your father.

30:21.602 --> 30:23.102
Yeah, well, my father's gone.

30:23.700 --> 30:25.500
Either you're working some scam, or

30:26.040 --> 30:27.576
you're just plain crazy.

30:28.071 --> 30:29.371
I'm not, and you know it.

30:29.859 --> 30:30.809
She's not, daddy.

30:31.414 --> 30:32.364
Please,

30:32.559 --> 30:34.229
come with me to see judge Merrick.

30:34.230 --> 30:35.118
And do what?

30:35.119 --> 30:36.069
Lay this to rest.

30:39.075 --> 30:40.025
Come in.

30:40.482 --> 30:41.432
She your boss?

30:42.546 --> 30:44.096
Um, she's my partner.

30:45.070 --> 30:46.820
You're partners with a white lady?

30:48.201 --> 30:49.000
Well,

30:49.001 --> 30:50.927
she's also my friend, Jameel.

30:51.812 --> 30:52.912
She's my best friend.

30:54.511 --> 30:58.211
My dad says that people wouldn't fight if they stuck with their own kind.

30:59.855 --> 31:01.705
Well, your dad's a pretty smart guy.

31:04.724 --> 31:06.024
You know what my kind is?

31:07.386 --> 31:08.336
Here.

31:11.243 --> 31:12.590
People who

31:13.313 --> 31:14.613
are respectful of others,

31:15.651 --> 31:17.051
people who are intelligent,

31:17.280 --> 31:20.472
kind, funny, nice to kids,

31:21.846 --> 31:22.896
people like Melinda.

31:23.556 --> 31:25.460
- She's funny?
- Oh, she's so funny.

31:27.001 --> 31:29.151
See that's the thing about people, Jameel.

31:29.580 --> 31:32.553
You don't know who they are just by looking at them.

31:33.770 --> 31:35.270
You have to get to know them.

31:36.312 --> 31:38.012
But your dad is absolutely right.

31:38.776 --> 31:40.976
Once you find out that someone's your kind,

31:42.127 --> 31:43.177
you stick with them.

31:55.538 --> 31:56.748
You owe me.

31:58.285 --> 31:59.635
Can I do anything for you?

32:00.306 --> 32:01.331
Rain check.

32:02.926 --> 32:05.124
Yeah, I remember, but not now, ok?

32:05.336 --> 32:06.886
It's your turn to help me.

32:07.435 --> 32:08.650
And it's gotta be now.

32:11.323 --> 32:12.273
Why?

32:12.703 --> 32:16.347
Because I was working here the night they brought Link Hofstadter in.

32:18.220 --> 32:20.576
I waited two hours for the son of a bitch.

32:26.941 --> 32:28.716
I was just gonna throw him a beating.

32:28.717 --> 32:30.667
You know, show him how he has to treat

32:30.970 --> 32:31.920
a white man.

32:35.460 --> 32:36.460
You're the witness.

32:37.707 --> 32:39.881
He told me everything.

32:45.029 --> 32:45.979
Well...

32:48.077 --> 32:49.327
this is a nice send-off.

32:49.414 --> 32:50.650
They're letting me out on parole.

32:50.651 --> 32:53.551
I suggested they sentence me to community service, but...

32:55.261 --> 32:56.460
I'm sorry, do I know you?

32:56.461 --> 32:58.211
This is Randall Fisher. Ely's son.

33:00.162 --> 33:02.557
The two of you will have to excuse me. I've gotta get dressed.

33:02.558 --> 33:04.308
There was a witness, wasn't there?

33:05.325 --> 33:06.919
A nurse, who came to you.

33:07.671 --> 33:10.671
I don't know what you're talking about. I'm going home now.

33:13.079 --> 33:14.529
Hey, I wasn't gonna end him.

33:14.942 --> 33:17.365
Maybe he shouldn't have raised his hands to me.

33:18.085 --> 33:19.485
You know, he should've just

33:19.540 --> 33:21.005
taken what he had coming.

33:21.709 --> 33:23.821
Maybe then I would've left him alive.

33:25.622 --> 33:26.572
Hey, come here.

33:27.734 --> 33:31.420
We have to keep this place safe. For our kind.

33:33.590 --> 33:34.890
But that's not it, is it?

33:36.092 --> 33:39.353
The E.R. nurse came to you and told you what Link had said to her.

33:39.354 --> 33:42.112
Mr. Merrick, I'm the nurse who called you.

33:42.972 --> 33:44.646
Link told me everything.

33:45.043 --> 33:46.143
I talked to Link too.

33:46.293 --> 33:47.243
He was drunk.

33:47.407 --> 33:50.182
There's more people to think he got jumped by a black man in an alley

33:50.183 --> 33:51.657
and he didn't defend himself.

33:51.658 --> 33:52.997
That's not the story.

33:53.327 --> 33:54.877
Well, it's a case I can't win.

33:55.042 --> 33:56.192
So the case is closed.

33:56.538 --> 33:59.944
The next day there was $5,000 in my checking account.

34:00.485 --> 34:03.185
The Hofstadters put $5,000 into her checking account.

34:05.235 --> 34:06.185
What?

34:07.644 --> 34:09.444
I didn't know, I swear. She never told me.

34:09.444 --> 34:12.242
She tried to tell you once, but you told her that the case was closed.

34:12.243 --> 34:15.161
- But if I'd known they paid her...
- you should've looked again.

34:15.163 --> 34:16.612
But you wanted to look away.

34:17.824 --> 34:19.641
How do you know all of this anyway?

34:20.710 --> 34:22.719
How do I know you didn't just invent it?

34:22.721 --> 34:23.547
It's the truth.

34:23.547 --> 34:25.987
Check the bank records if you don't believe me, but the easier way,

34:25.987 --> 34:27.097
is just to do nothing.

34:27.098 --> 34:28.447
This was a stupid argument

34:28.945 --> 34:30.045
that got out of hand.

34:30.782 --> 34:32.429
It was an argument over a dollar an hour.

34:32.431 --> 34:34.681
This had nothing to do with a dollar an hour

34:35.166 --> 34:37.166
or a seat on a bus or a water fountain.

34:37.889 --> 34:40.290
This is about something bigger and you know it.

34:43.159 --> 34:44.710
I didn't know about the money.

34:45.833 --> 34:46.838
Well, you do now.

34:48.092 --> 34:50.900
I just didn't believe he could've done something like this.

34:50.902 --> 34:53.252
We know what you believe, judge, then and now,

34:53.763 --> 34:56.641
and we both know why you looked away, don't we?

35:22.112 --> 35:25.716
Walter Merrick was not only a judge in this courthouse for 25 years,

35:26.276 --> 35:28.476
he was instrumental in restoring Grand View

35:29.127 --> 35:30.877
to the town many of us grew up in.

35:31.194 --> 35:33.979
The storm has passed. He's healthy and strong as ever.

35:34.390 --> 35:35.532
Judge Walter Merrick.

35:38.923 --> 35:39.973
Thank you very much.

35:42.160 --> 35:43.210
I've been recognized

35:43.951 --> 35:45.896
as many things in this town.

35:48.896 --> 35:49.607
A tough,

35:49.608 --> 35:50.558
but fair-minded

35:51.292 --> 35:52.242
judge,

35:53.122 --> 35:54.272
a deacon of my church,

35:55.280 --> 35:56.230
a good husband.

35:57.863 --> 35:58.863
The one thing I was

35:59.327 --> 36:00.277
not known as...

36:01.684 --> 36:02.634
is a racist.

36:05.704 --> 36:06.654
30 years ago,

36:07.557 --> 36:09.437
a black man, Ely Fisher was killed

36:10.485 --> 36:11.535
right in the square.

36:12.239 --> 36:13.996
The plain truth is, I assumed

36:14.989 --> 36:16.614
Ely Fisher was the guilty one.

36:17.178 --> 36:18.342
I made a judgment call

36:18.942 --> 36:19.892
that was callous

36:21.190 --> 36:22.140
and bigoted.

36:24.423 --> 36:28.022
It would be easy to say, it was 30 years ago,

36:29.770 --> 36:30.720
but the truth

36:32.488 --> 36:34.738
is that I was that same man until yesterday.

36:36.111 --> 36:37.061
Despite

36:37.353 --> 36:39.834
great progress in this country, racism

36:40.894 --> 36:42.194
is still very much alive.

36:43.263 --> 36:44.213
It can be subtle,

36:45.228 --> 36:47.898
handed down from generation to generation.

36:49.901 --> 36:52.850
This tragedy is my shame.

36:54.433 --> 36:55.383
My debt.

36:56.704 --> 36:57.654
But,

36:58.199 --> 37:00.188
if it becomes a reason to change,

37:02.860 --> 37:05.160
for even one of you, or one of your children,

37:07.415 --> 37:08.607
Ely Fisher's death

37:10.106 --> 37:11.606
will have gained new meaning.

37:12.695 --> 37:15.185
So later today, I will officially recommend

37:16.050 --> 37:17.450
that this plaque be removed

37:18.218 --> 37:19.768
and that a new one replace it.

37:20.225 --> 37:21.178
One that dedicates

37:21.881 --> 37:22.831
this courthouse

37:24.234 --> 37:25.184
to Ely Fisher.

37:30.853 --> 37:32.244
Hey, there's grandpa.

37:38.169 --> 37:39.773
Where'd grandpa go?

37:41.009 --> 37:43.659
Thank you all for coming, and enjoy the festivities.

38:00.755 --> 38:01.827
Is he gone for good?

38:02.978 --> 38:03.928
I don't know.

38:05.819 --> 38:07.062
Ely, I...

38:09.675 --> 38:10.625
Grandpa,

38:10.972 --> 38:12.372
daddy needs to talk to you.

38:12.947 --> 38:13.897
I'm right here.

38:15.043 --> 38:15.993
He's here.

38:16.465 --> 38:17.565
Ask him how he feels.

38:18.241 --> 38:19.191
I hardly know.

38:20.364 --> 38:22.114
I'm glad the right thing was done,

38:22.551 --> 38:23.851
but it don't change much.

38:24.624 --> 38:25.824
Thought I'd feel happy,

38:26.318 --> 38:27.268
like I won.

38:30.572 --> 38:32.043
I don't think anyone won.

38:33.218 --> 38:34.168
He's glad

38:34.522 --> 38:37.122
that the truth came out, but it didn't change much.

38:37.122 --> 38:38.072
It does, pop.

38:38.658 --> 38:41.758
I thought staying mad all that time really gave me something.

38:42.786 --> 38:44.167
Something to stay here for.

38:44.168 --> 38:45.568
Something to keep me going.

38:45.989 --> 38:47.456
But it took a lot away too.

38:49.388 --> 38:50.771
From me, from you,

38:52.620 --> 38:54.484
even Jameel. And that's gotta stop.

38:55.152 --> 38:56.252
I'm not mad, grandpa.

38:59.185 --> 39:00.435
That's good, little man.

39:00.804 --> 39:03.454
And you make sure your pops doesn't stay mad either.

39:04.054 --> 39:05.004
You tell him

39:06.271 --> 39:07.621
he can let go of this now.

39:08.926 --> 39:10.126
He's got a clean slate.

39:11.146 --> 39:12.096
So do I.

39:20.204 --> 39:21.154
I see it.

39:23.292 --> 39:24.242
A light.

39:26.269 --> 39:27.219
I guess it's time.

39:28.705 --> 39:30.755
- You're ready.
- Time for what, grandpa?

39:33.974 --> 39:36.374
To see your grandma Rachel and your aunt Celia.

39:36.788 --> 39:37.738
Can I meet them?

39:39.342 --> 39:40.292
No.

39:41.094 --> 39:42.044
Not quite yet.

39:44.687 --> 39:45.987
He looks like his mother.

39:46.611 --> 39:48.231
That's a good thing too.

39:49.180 --> 39:51.364
He's glad that you look like your mother.

39:57.035 --> 39:57.985
I thought...

39:59.327 --> 40:00.759
that it would hurt too much

40:02.383 --> 40:03.333
if I knew you.

40:04.902 --> 40:06.552
Or if I remembered you too well.

40:08.079 --> 40:10.223
But you left such a big hole.

40:10.977 --> 40:12.377
Tell him he grew up strong.

40:12.523 --> 40:14.073
And I'm proud of him for that.

40:14.833 --> 40:16.483
But he's gotta grow up soft now.

40:16.920 --> 40:18.170
He's gotta teach his son

40:19.358 --> 40:20.308
to be both.

40:24.306 --> 40:26.511
- Tell him I said goodbye.
- I will.

40:48.233 --> 40:49.183
Ely, wait.

40:52.808 --> 40:56.008
Before you said that there are people who are interested in me.

40:56.388 --> 40:57.500
Who and why me?

40:58.294 --> 40:59.244
I was mad,

40:59.735 --> 41:01.135
I didn't mean to scare you.

41:01.197 --> 41:02.147
What did you mean?

41:03.453 --> 41:04.853
I don't know. I'm not sure.

41:06.208 --> 41:08.603
There's a lot I don't understand.

41:11.499 --> 41:12.549
They know about you.

41:13.893 --> 41:14.843
And not

41:15.175 --> 41:17.209
everybody is happy about what you do.
