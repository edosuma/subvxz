[Boyd] Previously, on From...

00:02.524 --> 00:03.612
There's darkness in the forest,

00:03.742 --> 00:07.094
nightmares you can't even
begin to imagine.

00:07.224 --> 00:08.443
[children]
Anghkooey. Anghkooey.

00:08.573 --> 00:10.793
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no!

00:10.923 --> 00:12.664
Don't touch me. Don't touch me!
Don't, don't!

00:12.795 --> 00:14.318
Anghkooey.

00:14.449 --> 00:16.799
-[shouts]
-Hey, hey! You okay?

00:16.929 --> 00:19.323
-Did you see them?
-See what? See who?

00:19.454 --> 00:22.718
[Victor] Eloise said that's
where my mother went that night,

00:22.848 --> 00:25.329
the night
the bad things happened.

00:25.460 --> 00:28.202
She went to save the children
locked in the tower.

00:28.332 --> 00:29.681
[Kenny]
This mean a lot to you?

00:29.812 --> 00:31.205
-Don't. Please.
-Yeah? Fuck you!

00:32.467 --> 00:34.034
You ever come near
my mom again,

00:34.164 --> 00:35.513
I will drag
your fucking psycho ass

00:35.644 --> 00:36.819
into that Box myself.

00:36.949 --> 00:39.300
We, uh, pulled something
out of that thing.

00:39.430 --> 00:41.345
Only problem is we gotta
figure out how to get this

00:41.476 --> 00:42.694
inside another one
of those things

00:42.825 --> 00:44.218
without getting ourselves
killed.

00:44.348 --> 00:46.220
So make some silver bullets.

00:47.351 --> 00:50.441
Well, you think this place is
one big experiment, right?

00:50.572 --> 00:52.574
And it never occurred to you

00:52.704 --> 00:54.706
that some of the people here
might be in on it?

00:54.837 --> 00:56.404
I mean, they'd have to be.

00:56.534 --> 00:58.667
How else do you keep
the experiment on track?

01:01.452 --> 01:03.150
Randall, what the fuck?

01:03.280 --> 01:05.412
New plan.

01:05.543 --> 01:07.806
[Kristi] Elgin had a dream
that he was drowning

01:07.937 --> 01:09.373
and he started
spitting up water,

01:09.504 --> 01:12.202
and you had cicadas
in your dreams, and...

01:12.333 --> 01:14.291
When the music box
started playing,

01:14.422 --> 01:17.077
one of them jumped out
and it burned my arm.

01:17.207 --> 01:18.643
Are you honestly saying
that our fucking dreams

01:18.774 --> 01:20.384
can hurt us now?

01:20.515 --> 01:22.343
-[buzzing]
-Do you hear that?

01:22.473 --> 01:24.126
[Reggie] Help me!

01:24.257 --> 01:26.781
Please.
Please. I need help!

01:39.708 --> 01:40.796
She said, um...

01:42.711 --> 01:44.800
She said she was gonna
take a nap.

01:47.194 --> 01:48.760
I was downstairs.

01:50.719 --> 01:52.416
And I heard her
screaming.

01:54.418 --> 01:56.551
I-I came in and I--

01:56.681 --> 01:59.206
I started
shaking her, and...

01:59.336 --> 02:00.598
[sobs briefly]

02:01.425 --> 02:04.298
...trying to wake her up,
and, um, she kept...

02:05.908 --> 02:08.606
She was talking
in her sleep,

02:08.737 --> 02:12.610
saying something
over and over.

02:14.525 --> 02:16.353
And then she, uh...

02:16.484 --> 02:20.749
Something cracked inside her,

02:20.879 --> 02:24.318
and her body
and her face...

02:25.928 --> 02:28.757
Oh, God. Jesus.

02:29.932 --> 02:31.368
What did she say?

02:31.499 --> 02:33.327
[Reggie]
What?

02:33.457 --> 02:36.285
You said she was talking.
What did she say?

02:36.417 --> 02:38.549
I don't--

02:38.680 --> 02:39.594
Hey, hey, Reggie.

02:39.724 --> 02:40.898
I can't. No.

02:41.030 --> 02:43.902
Reggie, Reggie. Hey.
Listen, Reggie.

02:44.033 --> 02:46.208
I need you...

02:46.340 --> 02:49.212
I need you to tell me
what she said.

02:54.739 --> 02:56.567
It was, um...

02:59.744 --> 03:02.704
"They touch.
They break..."

03:06.925 --> 03:08.318
"They steal..."

03:09.624 --> 03:11.539
No one here
is free."

03:14.585 --> 03:15.847
And then she just...

03:17.545 --> 03:18.981
Her face just fucking...

03:20.025 --> 03:22.637
[cries]

03:22.767 --> 03:24.682
And was she still
asleep?

03:24.813 --> 03:25.944
Are you sure
she was asleep?

03:26.075 --> 03:28.164
Yes, I'm fucking sure!

03:28.295 --> 03:30.166
Okay, okay.

03:30.297 --> 03:32.647

Listen, we gotta--

04:47.199 --> 04:49.680
We gotta tell
the people door to door.

04:49.811 --> 04:51.856
Okay? We got 30 minutes left

You and Julie cover the town.
I'll go to Colony House.

Boyd, what's going on?

05:05.957 --> 05:07.002
What happened in there?

05:10.005 --> 05:11.441
Something killed Paula.

05:13.225 --> 05:15.837
But it's not dark yet.
I don't...

05:15.967 --> 05:18.448
There's something else here now.
Something new.

05:22.104 --> 05:23.801
It's not safe for anyone
to go to sleep tonight.

Okay?

I'm so sorry.

Don't apologize to her.

05:54.441 --> 05:57.400

up at the clinic.

05:57.531 --> 05:59.968
Yeah, that's right.
I followed you.

06:00.098 --> 06:03.580
They were carrying one of their
monsters out of the clinic.

06:03.711 --> 06:06.801
Well, what are they,
some kind of animatronic?

06:06.931 --> 06:08.672
You got a faulty model, huh?

06:08.803 --> 06:10.065
That was a body,
you dumb shit.

06:10.195 --> 06:11.327
Okay.

06:11.458 --> 06:12.807

one of them.

06:12.937 --> 06:14.591
He what?

06:14.722 --> 06:16.376
He killed one of
the monsters.

06:16.506 --> 06:18.160
So, now they can fucking die?

06:18.290 --> 06:20.728
It's funny how suddenly
the rules fucking change

your bullshit.

kidding me?

of the plan.

this shit in my head

[Fatima] Just tell
me what happened.

13:43.083 --> 13:47.043
She, uh... she went
to sleep, and...

13:47.174 --> 13:49.263
something...

13:49.393 --> 13:50.917
...broke her.

13:51.047 --> 13:52.440
[indistinct murmurs]

13:52.570 --> 13:54.834
Where's Donna?

13:54.964 --> 13:56.226
I'm supposed to talk
to Donna.

13:56.357 --> 13:58.011
Donna's not here
right now.

13:58.141 --> 13:59.447
She left
the clinic hours ago.

14:00.665 --> 14:02.363
Did she say
where she was going?

14:02.493 --> 14:03.538
Yeah, she said she was
coming here.

14:05.670 --> 14:07.281
We're all gonna
fucking die.

14:07.411 --> 14:09.196
[indistinct murmurs]

14:09.326 --> 14:11.067
No. Hey, Reggie,
look at me. Listen.

14:11.198 --> 14:13.243
You need to tell me
exactly what Boyd said.

14:14.070 --> 14:17.465
We can't go to sleep.
No one goes to sleep.

14:17.595 --> 14:19.467
[Fatima]
Okay. Okay, great.

14:19.597 --> 14:21.338
Then that's
what we focus on, yeah?

14:21.469 --> 14:22.557
Wherever Donna is,
she and Boyd

14:22.687 --> 14:23.950
are gonna figure this out.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.342
So, how about right now
we just focus

14:25.473 --> 14:28.519
on doing our part, yeah?

14:28.650 --> 14:31.522
How about you and I go get you
a change of clothes, and, uh...

14:31.653 --> 14:34.525
Everybody partner up.
Make sure nobody falls asleep.

14:34.656 --> 14:36.397
-Yeah?
-Yeah. For how long?

14:39.574 --> 14:41.315
We'll figure that out
when we get to it, yeah?

14:41.445 --> 14:43.186
Mm-hmm.

14:43.317 --> 14:46.233
[Fatima]
Hey, Elgin, partner up.

14:46.363 --> 14:47.669
Come on, guys. Let's go.

14:51.020 --> 14:52.282
You guys doing okay?

14:52.413 --> 14:54.328
Is there maybe a room
we could use?

14:54.458 --> 14:56.373
-Yeah, yeah.
-Thanks.

14:56.504 --> 14:58.898
-Hey. Come on.
-Come on.

14:59.028 --> 15:00.551
-You okay?
-We'll get you upstairs.

15:10.605 --> 15:15.044
What do you mean
we can't go to sleep?

15:15.175 --> 15:17.220
Jim, why the hell
do you think I'm out here?

15:17.351 --> 15:19.266
Your daughter is terrified.

15:19.396 --> 15:21.224
Huh? Just put that over
there for me.

15:21.355 --> 15:22.530
Please.

15:26.229 --> 15:28.014
Are you fucking
kidding me?

15:28.144 --> 15:29.102
Pick a lane, Jim.

15:29.232 --> 15:31.060
Don't you see
what this is?

15:31.191 --> 15:33.236
-Not now.
-We come out here,

15:33.367 --> 15:35.282
we actually have them
by the balls,

15:35.412 --> 15:36.631
and Sheriff
fucking DoReady

15:36.761 --> 15:38.111
comes out here
with a new story

15:38.241 --> 15:39.068
and you're just, like...

15:40.852 --> 15:42.550
No wonder your family's
a fucking mess.

15:42.680 --> 15:44.682
-Son of a--
-[Boyd] Hey, hey, hey!

15:44.813 --> 15:46.075
-What?
-Jim!

15:46.206 --> 15:49.383
Hey, hey, hey. What the--

15:49.513 --> 15:51.124
Fuck!

15:51.254 --> 15:54.692
Hold on. Hold on.
Now, hold on. Yeah, yeah.

15:54.823 --> 15:58.174
I am only gonna say this
one time, okay?

15:59.088 --> 16:02.309
Whatever stupid fucking ideas
you got locked in

16:02.439 --> 16:05.660
that rock-hard head of yours,
they are gonna get you killed.

16:05.790 --> 16:08.489
Or worse off, they're gonna
get one of us killed,

16:08.619 --> 16:10.970
and I'm not planning on
dying here tonight.

16:11.100 --> 16:13.581
Shut the fuck up
and sit down.

16:13.711 --> 16:15.235
Yes, sir.

16:18.716 --> 16:21.110
And you.

16:21.241 --> 16:23.112
After all the shit you've
been through here, huh?

16:23.243 --> 16:24.548
You still think
this is a fucking game?

16:24.679 --> 16:26.202
-I was trying to...
-Argh!

16:28.291 --> 16:29.989
It wasn't supposed to
happen this way.

16:30.119 --> 16:31.294
So, you led a pig to shit,

16:31.425 --> 16:33.079
and now you're surprised
he made a mess?

16:33.209 --> 16:34.732
Hey. Fuck you.

16:34.863 --> 16:36.473
Fuck you.

16:39.128 --> 16:41.087
I've gotta get back to
my family.

16:41.217 --> 16:42.131
-[sighs]
-Jim?

16:42.262 --> 16:43.350
These old vans,

16:43.480 --> 16:45.221
they've got a pretty basic
ignition system.

16:45.352 --> 16:47.136
Even without the keys,
I think I can probably--

16:47.267 --> 16:48.442
Hey, I'm not gonna lose
another person

16:48.572 --> 16:50.444
to "probably," you got me?

16:50.574 --> 16:52.011
We are barely
making it through right now.

16:52.141 --> 16:53.142
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

16:53.273 --> 16:55.362
Hey! I said sit down.

16:55.492 --> 16:57.799
I'm not listening to this shit
all fucking night, okay?

17:00.758 --> 17:02.803
Sit down.

17:03.630 --> 17:06.721
All right. I don't know
what your deal is,

17:06.850 --> 17:08.070
whether
you're part of this

17:08.201 --> 17:09.505
or you're just fucking
dumber than you--

17:11.291 --> 17:13.640
I lost my wife here.

17:13.771 --> 17:15.469
My friend bled to death
in my arms

17:15.599 --> 17:18.385
and you still think I'm lying?

17:18.514 --> 17:20.474
You want proof?

17:20.604 --> 17:23.738
What if I tie your ass up
to one of those trees out there,

17:23.868 --> 17:25.392
let you find out
for yourself?

17:42.670 --> 17:45.412
This the freaky sex room?

17:47.631 --> 17:50.721
First night's rough
for some people.

17:50.852 --> 17:52.723
They can get unpredictable.

17:56.466 --> 17:58.816
I'm, uh, I'm gonna go grab
a few supplies, okay?

18:02.255 --> 18:04.344
You gonna be okay
for a minute?

18:07.477 --> 18:08.435
Give me a hand?

18:09.479 --> 18:10.524
Yeah.

18:18.619 --> 18:20.186
She looks pretty rough.

18:20.316 --> 18:22.753
Yeah. Tonight's gonna be
the hardest.

18:22.884 --> 18:24.581
I'm gonna need a pot,
a washcloth

18:24.712 --> 18:26.409
and probably
some extra linens.

18:26.540 --> 18:28.237
Yeah, yeah.
Of course.

18:28.368 --> 18:29.760
[clears throat]

18:31.371 --> 18:33.155
All right. Look, um,

18:33.286 --> 18:34.765
I don't really know
how to ask this,

18:34.896 --> 18:37.464
but this whole thing
about not sleeping,

18:37.594 --> 18:38.769
I mean, do we need to
be worried?

18:39.988 --> 18:41.207
Like, they--
about the baby.

18:41.337 --> 18:43.687
I mean, they sleep
in there, right?

18:43.818 --> 18:46.647
I mean, if she were further
along, then, yeah, maybe,

18:46.777 --> 18:49.258
but she's six,
maybe seven weeks at most.

18:49.389 --> 18:51.173
Okay.

18:51.304 --> 18:53.262
Look, of all the things
we need to worry about tonight,

18:53.393 --> 18:55.221
I promise you
that's not one of them.

18:56.700 --> 18:57.875
I mean, yeah.

18:58.006 --> 18:59.834
You know, it's just...
it's just weird.

18:59.964 --> 19:01.227
You know, it's like, uh...

19:02.793 --> 19:07.320
I just--there's a--
there's a person

19:07.450 --> 19:09.931
growing inside of
my fiancée,

19:10.061 --> 19:11.454
and anywhere else
in the world,

19:11.585 --> 19:12.760
I mean,
that would be great.

19:12.890 --> 19:14.588
You know? I would be thrilled,
which I am.

19:16.024 --> 19:19.680
But here, you know,
I just...

19:19.810 --> 19:22.552
I just keep expecting
that at any second,

19:22.683 --> 19:24.424
he's gonna come
bursting out of her with, like,

19:24.554 --> 19:27.470
with fangs and claws.

19:27.601 --> 19:29.168
If it's any consolation,
I mean,

19:29.298 --> 19:31.344
pregnancy is weird,
no matter where you are.

19:31.474 --> 19:33.824
I mean, it's beautiful,
but it's fucking weird.

19:33.955 --> 19:36.827
We're just used to it
because we see it every day.

19:36.958 --> 19:38.481
It's like the magic ball
of fire.

19:38.612 --> 19:40.744
The what?

19:40.875 --> 19:42.311
It's this thing
from med school.

19:42.442 --> 19:43.878
The whole world,

19:44.008 --> 19:46.359
even the parts that
we think we understand,

19:46.489 --> 19:49.579
it's all really just
one big mystery,

19:49.710 --> 19:51.668
floating through space
around a...

19:51.799 --> 19:53.888
giant ball of magic fire
that keeps us warm

19:54.018 --> 19:55.890
from a million miles away.

19:56.020 --> 19:57.718
I mean,
it's fucking insane.

19:58.501 --> 20:00.286
We're just used to it,
that's all.

20:03.332 --> 20:04.768
Pregnancy's weird.

20:08.642 --> 20:10.644
I can't believe he had
a sister.

20:10.774 --> 20:13.690
How do you-- How do you forget
something like that?

20:13.821 --> 20:15.475
I don't know, but you
should've seen his face

20:15.605 --> 20:16.693
when we opened
the trunk.

20:16.824 --> 20:18.478
It was awful.

20:19.783 --> 20:22.438
Here. Look at this.

20:22.569 --> 20:24.875
-You see this one?
-Yeah.

20:25.006 --> 20:26.007
Now, you see the color
of those uniforms?

20:26.137 --> 20:28.270
These are Civil War
soldiers.

20:28.401 --> 20:30.359
And why the fuck would
a little girl draw pictures--

20:30.490 --> 20:32.013
Wait. No, no, no.

20:32.143 --> 20:33.667
The pictures came from
the stories

20:33.797 --> 20:35.277
his mother used to tell.

20:35.408 --> 20:36.887
All right, then. Why the fuck
am I having visions

20:37.018 --> 20:39.455
of a story some dead woman
told 40 years ago?

20:40.630 --> 20:41.849
[sighs]

20:52.642 --> 20:54.688
Do you wanna see
something really weird?

20:55.776 --> 20:56.994
Look at this.

21:00.694 --> 21:02.478
So, Victor said
his mother

21:02.609 --> 21:04.959
wanted to rescue the children
that were locked in the tower,

21:05.089 --> 21:07.570
that it was the only way
to get everyone home.

21:07.701 --> 21:10.443
Since I got here,
I've had dreams

21:10.573 --> 21:13.359
about walking up the steps
of a tower just like this.

21:18.364 --> 21:19.800
I mean,
all this time,

21:19.930 --> 21:21.715
I thought the children
were trying to scare me, but...

21:23.499 --> 21:25.501
what if they're just
asking for my help?

21:25.632 --> 21:27.503
[door opens]

21:29.418 --> 21:31.464
Okay. Everyone come.

21:31.594 --> 21:32.726
Sit.

21:34.031 --> 21:35.729
Hey, Ethan.

21:35.859 --> 21:36.904
Away from the window.

21:38.558 --> 21:39.950
What are we doing?

21:40.081 --> 21:42.692
We play.
Feel better.

21:46.217 --> 21:48.481
Yeah.
I mean, can't go to sleep.

21:48.611 --> 21:49.873
Might as well
have some fun.

21:51.701 --> 21:53.050
Right?

21:58.447 --> 22:00.362
Is my dad gonna die?

22:03.147 --> 22:05.367
What? No.

22:05.498 --> 22:06.934
No, Dad is gonna be fine.

22:07.064 --> 22:08.849
Are we gonna die?

22:10.590 --> 22:12.679
No.
No one is gonna die.

22:14.463 --> 22:16.813
When Victor was little,
everyone died.

22:18.075 --> 22:20.034
All at the same time.

22:20.164 --> 22:21.688
It won't happen
like that again.

22:21.818 --> 22:23.385
How do you know?

22:29.130 --> 22:32.089
Look, I know things
are really scary right now...

22:33.787 --> 22:35.658
but remember what
the Cromenockle would do

22:35.789 --> 22:37.007
when she got scared?
She would say--

22:37.138 --> 22:38.835
It doesn't matter!

22:38.966 --> 22:40.446
She's not real.

22:40.576 --> 22:42.317
It doesn't matter
what she did.

22:42.448 --> 22:44.014
It's just a stupid story.

22:48.671 --> 22:51.065
My mother used to say

22:51.195 --> 22:55.025
that everything
is a story,

22:55.156 --> 22:57.985
and we're the ones who get
to decide how it ends.

22:59.987 --> 23:01.684
What about her story?

23:01.815 --> 23:03.077
Did it end the way
she wanted?

23:03.207 --> 23:04.861
-Ethan!
-[speaks Cantonese]

23:04.992 --> 23:06.515
Be good.

23:06.646 --> 23:07.951
I don't wanna play any games.

23:10.867 --> 23:12.434
I'm so sorry.

23:18.832 --> 23:22.749
So, whatever was in your blood
that killed the creature,

23:22.879 --> 23:25.099
-that creature's blood is--
-Bile.

23:25.229 --> 23:26.579
The what?

23:26.709 --> 23:28.407
It...

23:28.537 --> 23:29.886
It doesn't matter.

23:30.017 --> 23:33.455
Point is, if it works,

23:33.586 --> 23:35.544
we're all walking
back to town.

23:35.675 --> 23:37.154
And if it doesn't?

23:37.285 --> 23:38.982
[Boyd]
What do you care, huh?

23:39.113 --> 23:40.810
None of it's real, right?

23:40.941 --> 23:42.682
Why don't you let him do it?

23:42.812 --> 23:44.423
What?

23:44.553 --> 23:48.427
He's not afraid to go outside,
so give him your gun.

23:48.557 --> 23:50.603
See if these monster killers
really work.

23:50.733 --> 23:52.735
One way or another,
we get rid of a problem.

23:54.258 --> 23:56.739
[distant scream]

23:56.870 --> 23:59.742
But make up your mind.
They're coming.

23:59.873 --> 24:01.875
[Jim]
How many are there?

24:02.005 --> 24:04.573
-Oh, I can see a few.
-Are they close?

24:04.704 --> 24:06.575
[Donna] They're getting
a lot fucking closer.

24:06.706 --> 24:08.011
All right.

24:08.142 --> 24:09.535
Show time.

24:12.538 --> 24:13.887
[Jim]
Hey, wait.

24:14.017 --> 24:16.455
You're not gonna let him
do this, are you?

24:16.585 --> 24:19.675
He's a big boy.
He can choose.

24:19.806 --> 24:22.765
[distant scream]

24:22.896 --> 24:24.637
[Jim]
They're over here, too.

24:24.767 --> 24:25.768
Boyd?

24:27.204 --> 24:28.815
-[distant scream]
-Gotta be now.

24:28.945 --> 24:30.207
You going or not?

24:33.254 --> 24:34.690
All right.

24:38.172 --> 24:41.131
You have any
second thoughts,

24:41.262 --> 24:43.569
you better get your ass
right back here.

24:54.231 --> 24:55.624
What the fuck?

24:55.755 --> 24:57.931
Hold on.
What's going on?

24:58.061 --> 24:59.628
They've stopped.

24:59.759 --> 25:01.151
They've stopped here, too.

25:03.153 --> 25:05.112
-What?
-[Donna] Something's wrong.

25:05.242 --> 25:07.070
They don't just do that.

25:07.201 --> 25:08.637
Do what?

25:08.768 --> 25:10.639
They don't just stop
like that.

25:10.770 --> 25:12.598
For fuck's sake!
You people are just crazy.

25:19.692 --> 25:22.085
[music box plays faintly]

25:26.002 --> 25:27.134
Hey, do--

25:27.264 --> 25:31.834
[music box continues]

25:42.279 --> 25:44.630
Do you...

25:44.760 --> 25:45.848
What's...

25:52.246 --> 25:53.900
Get the fuck away from me!

25:59.470 --> 26:01.342
No. Marielle! No, no, no.
What are you doing?

26:01.472 --> 26:03.213
-We have to get out of here!
-Stop, stop.

26:03.344 --> 26:05.041
-We have to go right now.
-Stop, stop, stop.

26:05.172 --> 26:07.653
No. You don't understand!
There's something in here.

26:07.783 --> 26:09.132
-There's something in the room.
-It's just me and you, okay?

26:09.263 --> 26:10.264
-No, no.
-There's nothing in here.

26:10.394 --> 26:12.048
It was a--

26:12.179 --> 26:14.877
You told me once that when
you first went through this,

26:15.008 --> 26:16.575
you saw a lot of things
that weren't there.

26:16.705 --> 26:19.142
No, the guy downstairs,
he said that we--

26:19.273 --> 26:22.058
He said that we can't
go to sleep, and that's all.

26:22.189 --> 26:23.233
We know what the monsters
look like here,

26:23.364 --> 26:24.757
and they're all outside.

26:24.887 --> 26:26.106
As long as you're in here
and you're awake,

26:26.236 --> 26:27.237
you're safe, okay?
Now, come sit down.

26:27.368 --> 26:28.804
-Don't touch me.
-Mari--

26:28.935 --> 26:32.286
-Don't fucking touch me!
-Mari. Okay. I'm sorry.

26:32.416 --> 26:35.071
[laughs] You're sorry?

26:35.202 --> 26:37.160
Yeah. This is your fault.

26:37.291 --> 26:41.556
You fucking...
You disappeared.

26:41.687 --> 26:42.992
I couldn't eat.

26:43.123 --> 26:44.733
I couldn't sleep.

26:44.864 --> 26:46.039
I mean,

26:46.169 --> 26:49.042
you fucking did this
to me!

26:49.172 --> 26:51.348
-You fucking--
-[smashing]

26:51.479 --> 26:53.350
[sobs]
I'm...

26:53.481 --> 26:56.223
I'm...

26:56.353 --> 26:57.964
I'm sorry.

26:58.094 --> 27:01.576
-I didn't... I'm sorry.
-It's okay. I'm fine.

27:01.707 --> 27:03.317
-We're okay.
-No.

27:03.447 --> 27:07.277
No, we are not fine.
We are not okay.

27:07.408 --> 27:09.715
Just... fuck.

27:11.934 --> 27:14.197
I don't wanna be like this.

27:14.328 --> 27:16.112
-I don't wanna be like this.
-Hey.

27:17.810 --> 27:19.028
Shh.

27:19.159 --> 27:21.901
Come here.
Hey.

27:22.031 --> 27:24.904
Shh.

27:29.560 --> 27:31.432
-[sobs]
-I'm right here, okay?

27:37.307 --> 27:39.309
I'm sorry.

27:40.833 --> 27:42.269
You're doing great, okay?

27:43.400 --> 27:45.054
-Come on.
-[sobs]

28:07.468 --> 28:09.296
We should put these on.

28:10.819 --> 28:13.387
Uh, I don't think
you have to do that.

28:16.782 --> 28:18.087
Yes, I do.

28:19.959 --> 28:21.787
Guess that one is mine.

28:25.399 --> 28:26.966
Which one is yours?

28:31.971 --> 28:34.800
Your mom once told me
how grateful she was

28:34.930 --> 28:36.758
that you were all together
when you...

28:39.021 --> 28:40.240
I'm sorry.

28:41.894 --> 28:43.983
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

28:55.995 --> 28:57.518
I, uh...

29:00.651 --> 29:05.352
I never really had the chance
to, um...

29:05.482 --> 29:08.050
I just want you to know
that I'm sorry.

29:08.181 --> 29:11.358
-[scoffs]
-And I know...

29:11.488 --> 29:13.839
I know
it doesn't mean anything...

29:14.622 --> 29:18.191
but if I could go back and
change what happened, I would.

29:18.321 --> 29:19.409
Stop.

29:21.455 --> 29:22.848
I know...

29:24.327 --> 29:26.025
...it's painful for you.

29:27.853 --> 29:30.116
Seeing me every day.

29:30.246 --> 29:32.335
-[scoffs]
-For you.

29:35.556 --> 29:37.210
For your mom.

29:37.340 --> 29:39.473
[scoffs]

29:39.603 --> 29:41.562
I told Boyd I wanted to go
back out in the forest.

29:41.692 --> 29:43.303
That way,
maybe I could still help,

29:43.433 --> 29:44.521
and you wouldn't
have to--

29:44.652 --> 29:46.915
I don't care.

29:47.046 --> 29:49.048
All right? I don't--
I don't care.

29:50.571 --> 29:53.269
I don't give a shit
what you want, what you feel.

29:55.402 --> 29:56.403
You don't get to sit here

29:56.533 --> 29:57.883
and have a pity party,

29:59.058 --> 30:00.450
because
you're a murderer.

30:00.581 --> 30:04.324
You're a murderer, and you
should've gone in the Box

30:04.454 --> 30:08.067
the second that Boyd
found out what you did.

30:08.197 --> 30:10.591
I know what I've done.

30:12.201 --> 30:13.550
I can never...

30:16.031 --> 30:18.294
I'll never be able to
take it back.

30:18.425 --> 30:20.035
I've ruined people's lives.

30:20.166 --> 30:21.297
-What I did to you--
-Yeah.

30:21.428 --> 30:24.344
-Yeah, you did.
-To your mom.

30:24.474 --> 30:25.998
You guys were like
family to me.

30:26.128 --> 30:28.261
-And your dad--
-Shut the fuck up!

30:30.437 --> 30:32.265
Shut the fuck up.

30:33.527 --> 30:35.964
Don't fucking talk
about my dad!

30:38.140 --> 30:39.228
No.

30:39.359 --> 30:41.622
-Excuse me?
-I said, no.

30:44.059 --> 30:46.322
I didn't ask
for any of this.

30:46.453 --> 30:48.107
[scoffs]

30:48.237 --> 30:50.326
You think you're the only one
who lost something?

30:50.457 --> 30:52.894
I've lost everything.

30:54.417 --> 30:56.985
Everything I was

30:57.116 --> 31:00.162
and everything I could have
been is gone.

31:01.772 --> 31:06.081
This place destroyed the only
person I ever get to be,

31:06.212 --> 31:08.388
and I'm tired.

31:08.518 --> 31:11.217
I'm tired of being afraid,

31:11.347 --> 31:14.524
and I am tired
of being ashamed.

31:14.655 --> 31:16.570
I don't want
to be here anymore.

31:16.700 --> 31:20.443
I don't-- I don't want
to be your monster anymore.

31:20.574 --> 31:23.142
I just want it to be over.

31:26.101 --> 31:27.059
Okay.

31:28.321 --> 31:30.410
Okay.
You want out?

31:30.540 --> 31:33.630
Boyd keeps a spare gun in
the top left-hand drawer.

31:33.761 --> 31:35.284
Do what the fuck
you wanna do.

31:55.391 --> 31:58.046
Wake up! Wake up!

31:59.308 --> 32:01.093
You can't go to sleep.

32:01.223 --> 32:02.529
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

32:02.659 --> 32:03.965
Are you listening to me?

32:04.096 --> 32:06.402
The talisman
will not protect you.

32:06.533 --> 32:09.101
There is nowhere
that you are safe!

32:09.231 --> 32:10.580
Reggie, stop.
You're scaring everyone.

32:10.711 --> 32:13.453
They should be scared.
You didn't see!

32:13.583 --> 32:14.976
You don't understand
what happens.

32:15.107 --> 32:16.064
Just take a second.

-[grunts]

32:18.066 --> 32:19.328
Whoa. Whoa.

32:19.459 --> 32:22.505
-Hey! Get off of me.
-Calm down!

32:22.636 --> 32:24.420
-Let me go!
-Hey, Reggie. Look at me. Stop.

32:24.551 --> 32:25.944
-Breathe, breathe.
-She was--

32:26.074 --> 32:27.467
-She was my--
-It's okay.

32:27.597 --> 32:29.251
I know. It's okay.

32:29.382 --> 32:30.600
We're gonna die.

32:30.731 --> 32:33.299
Tonight, tomorrow!

32:33.429 --> 32:35.040
Every one of you
is going to fucking die!

32:35.170 --> 32:38.086
-Get him upstairs.
-Get him outta here, now!

32:38.217 --> 32:39.261
Go!

32:39.392 --> 32:42.090
-Hey, calm down.
-You don't understand!

32:42.221 --> 32:43.439
-Stop!
-It's okay.

32:43.570 --> 32:45.702
Let go of me, please.

32:45.833 --> 32:47.139
Stop!

[music box plays over radio]

32:49.576 --> 32:51.230
This shit is--
is in fucking pieces.

32:51.360 --> 32:52.622
How is it--

32:57.236 --> 32:58.759
[Jim]
What are they waiting for?

32:58.889 --> 33:01.240
[music box continues playing]

33:04.373 --> 33:05.766
-What are you doing?
-I gotta go outside

33:05.896 --> 33:07.072
-and see if this thing works.
-No, Boyd.

33:07.202 --> 33:08.203
-You can't go.
-Listen to me.

33:08.334 --> 33:10.423
I've heard this music before,
Donna,

33:10.553 --> 33:13.643
and every time it plays,
bad shit follows.

33:13.774 --> 33:16.429
We gotta get
the fuck out of here, okay?

33:16.559 --> 33:17.996
[Boyd]
Okay. I just...

33:18.126 --> 33:19.606
-[music stops]
-I need to...

33:22.652 --> 33:24.045
-[thump]
-Oh, shit.

33:24.176 --> 33:26.569
-Jesus. What the fuck?
-What the fuck?

33:27.657 --> 33:29.485
Fuck this, man.

33:29.616 --> 33:31.792
There's no way.
There's no space under here.

33:31.922 --> 33:33.663
-Hey, Jim, Jim.
-[something thuds]

33:33.794 --> 33:36.057
-Hey, come here. Come, come.
-What, what, what?

33:36.188 --> 33:38.059
Come here.

33:38.190 --> 33:39.626
-Come. Come here!
-What?

33:39.756 --> 33:42.237
-[loud thud]
-Shh.

33:42.368 --> 33:45.806
Whatever happens,
be ready to run, okay?

33:45.936 --> 33:48.374
[electricity zapping,
high-pitched whining]

33:52.291 --> 33:53.727
Oh, fuck this.

33:53.857 --> 33:55.337
Fuck this. Fuck this.

33:59.254 --> 34:00.734
-Hey, hey!
-[Donna] Hey!

34:04.519 --> 34:06.348
Donna, move. Move.

34:09.481 --> 34:11.526
Okay, Donna.

34:11.658 --> 34:12.789
Hey, if you wanna
see your family again,

34:12.920 --> 34:13.747
you get that fucking
van going.

34:13.877 --> 34:14.747
-I got it. I got it.
-Okay?

Ah!

35:57.851 --> 36:00.593
[screaming, choking]

36:08.427 --> 36:09.906
[Kenny]
Put that away.

36:11.865 --> 36:13.258
Why?

36:15.608 --> 36:18.393
It's what everyone wants...

36:18.524 --> 36:19.612
isn't it?

36:33.974 --> 36:35.976
You were the one who said
I belonged in the Box.

36:37.064 --> 36:38.631
That's different.

36:38.761 --> 36:40.546
How?

36:40.676 --> 36:42.722
Put the fucking gun away.

36:51.948 --> 36:53.515
If I was in the Box...

36:56.866 --> 36:58.912
...it would be out
of your hands.

36:59.956 --> 37:02.220
It wouldn't be...

37:02.350 --> 37:04.657
...you killing me.

37:04.787 --> 37:07.355
It would be this place.

37:10.532 --> 37:12.578
I don't want to cause you
any more pain.

37:14.971 --> 37:19.672
So, we'll pretend
that we're in the Box.

37:21.935 --> 37:24.329
And we'll let
this place decide.

37:27.680 --> 37:29.595
What the fuck
are you talking about?

37:30.770 --> 37:31.858
How many should we use?

37:34.077 --> 37:35.427
One?

37:37.646 --> 37:39.474
Sara...

37:39.605 --> 37:40.780
Two?

37:41.911 --> 37:42.912
Hey. All right.

37:43.043 --> 37:44.262
-Okay. Hey, knock it off.
-Okay.

37:45.480 --> 37:46.916
-Just two.
-Hey, that's enough.

37:47.047 --> 37:48.831
Okay. Hey, hey, hey.

37:51.094 --> 37:52.705
No.

37:53.880 --> 37:56.535
You don't get to decide.

38:03.150 --> 38:04.586
Sara, it's okay.

38:06.501 --> 38:07.981
-[gun clicking]
-Hey, Sara, stop!

38:08.111 --> 38:09.548
Hey!

[pants]

38:18.731 --> 38:20.689
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

38:23.431 --> 38:24.998
Yeah.
So, this is where you pull.

38:25.128 --> 38:26.434
- Okay.
- And you can tell

38:26.565 --> 38:27.914
'cause they're all taut.

38:28.044 --> 38:28.915
-They're tight there, right?
-Uh-huh.

38:29.045 --> 38:30.046
So, you take it...

38:30.177 --> 38:32.005
-Oh.
-See? It's right there.

38:32.135 --> 38:33.267
Oh. Yeah.

38:33.398 --> 38:34.486
Hey, how are you guys doing?

38:34.616 --> 38:36.705
Oh, he's teaching me
how to crochet.

38:36.836 --> 38:38.446
-You are?
-Yeah.

38:38.577 --> 38:41.580
-Good. You're up?
-Mm-hmm.

38:41.710 --> 38:44.800
You're doing
a great job, you know?

38:44.931 --> 38:47.325
The way you handled
everything tonight.

38:47.455 --> 38:49.805
You're gonna be a great mom.

38:53.026 --> 38:54.680
You're pregnant?

38:55.942 --> 38:57.422
Uh...

38:58.553 --> 38:59.946
...yeah.

39:00.729 --> 39:03.428
- How did you know?
- Oh, sweetie.

39:03.558 --> 39:06.866
I've had four kids
and seven grandchildren.

39:06.996 --> 39:10.739
[chuckles] I know an expecting
mother when I see one.

39:14.090 --> 39:15.440
Hey.

39:15.570 --> 39:16.876
Hey, what's wrong?

39:19.661 --> 39:20.836
I just remembered my dream.

[van engine revs]

39:26.929 --> 39:28.366
Donna's back.

39:37.810 --> 39:39.377
-Stop.
-It'll help.

39:40.639 --> 39:41.901
I'm thirsty.

39:43.816 --> 39:45.470
I'll go get you some juice,
okay?

39:47.602 --> 39:48.821
Don't go.

39:50.083 --> 39:51.998
I'll be right back, okay?

I know, everybody.
Listen, I understand. I--

How long do we have to
stay awake?

41:19.607 --> 41:21.609
-If I-- Hey.
-Why is this happening?

41:21.740 --> 41:24.133
Everybody just calm down,
all right?

41:24.264 --> 41:26.658
Just calm down.
We know you're scared,

41:26.788 --> 41:28.573
and we are trying to
figure this out.

41:28.703 --> 41:30.836
But the best thing
you can do right now

41:30.966 --> 41:32.054
is just hang tight
and do what Boyd says.

-I gotta get back to my family.

Every time that door opens,
it puts everybody here at risk.

not at risk?

a fiancée right now.

She needs a doctor, okay?

42:32.332 --> 42:35.857
So, calm down, right,
and do your job, okay?

42:35.988 --> 42:38.251
How? There's nothing
medically I can do for that.

how to help her.

She's still breathing.

42:58.227 --> 42:59.707

to hear this.

You gotta hold on.

This whole time, I felt like
there was something that I...

43:19.118 --> 43:22.121
Like there was a reason
why I had that dream on the bus.

43:22.251 --> 43:24.950
Like there was something
I was supposed to remember.

43:25.080 --> 43:27.909

Fatima said she was pregnant,

-Hmm.

There was this boy...

43:59.245 --> 44:01.116
all dressed in white,
and...

44:03.075 --> 44:06.905
...he kept repeating
the same phrase over and over.

44:10.517 --> 44:12.824
"Here they come.
They come for three,

44:12.954 --> 44:15.043
unless you stop the melody."

44:18.003 --> 44:19.787
Wait. I know that one.

44:19.918 --> 44:21.789
It's an old nursery rhyme.

used to sing it to me.

"They come--" No.

"They touch. They break.
They steal.

44:36.108 --> 44:38.893

the melody."

what you're saying

connected.
